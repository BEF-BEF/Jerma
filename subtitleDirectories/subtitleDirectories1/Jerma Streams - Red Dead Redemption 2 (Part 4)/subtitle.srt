1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:10,810
Hey everybody. We're gonna try a test. We're gonna try to do it again. Who knows if this

2
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,929
is gonna be functional or not, but I am, you know, I'm willing to give it a try.

3
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:25,190
All you can do is try. You guys having a good day? What is today? I've lost all track of time

4
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:37,530
has been deleted. What is today? Thursday, November 1st. He's, he's, there he is. He's

5
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:48,500
Well, it never really went anywhere, but we've, we've had some solid green

6
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:56,899
over the last 24 hours. So I figured I would try because we've been dealing with, obviously

7
00:00:56,899 --> 00:01:03,539
Cox has been trying to get infrastructurally these problems fixed. And this is the first

8
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,299
time in probably two and a half weeks where we've had internet for more than like four

9
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:13,299
hours straight. So we're green for the moment. Let's see how, this could be 45 minutes or this

10
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:19,900
could be six hours. I don't know. I'm willing to give it an attempt though. And well,

11
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:26,140
we will update some information about the green screen stream. So you're gonna have to

12
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:34,260
stick around for that. There's some updated info. Here comes a 30 minute stream. All right,

13
00:01:34,260 --> 00:02:12,060
give me, give me one second. Also funnily enough, there was, I turned on the PS4

14
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:17,259
because this is where I was Red Dead 2. And I don't know. I think the, the PS4 must

15
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:24,699
have gone into rest mode because we're at the same screen I was at like four and a half

16
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:33,419
days ago. So we're just here. I don't really remember what I was doing, but I know that I

17
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:44,870
exist here. I got to remember the controls too. This is gonna be fucking hard. Even the game was

18
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:53,340
waiting. Yeah. It's like nothing ever happened. You guys just woke up. We all just woke up.

19
00:02:54,229 --> 00:03:02,550
And we're here four days later. We got 50, 50 bucks right off the bat from Pocket Pauling.

20
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:06,789
Thanks for the $50 Pocket Pauling. Finally, my dad is back from the war. Hey, Jerma,

21
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:12,550
how sad, relieved are you that you missed the Red Sox parade? Oh yeah, the Red Sox won

22
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:20,870
the World Series. That's right. That happened. What else has happened in the time that I haven't

23
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:29,340
been awake? I mean streaming, you know, Red Sox won the World Series. Super Smash Brothers

24
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:39,000
is coming out and they did a direct today. And excuse me. Excuse me. Where's my favorite

25
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:50,069
fucking character? Excuse me. Plant? Oh, I thought you guys were calling me a plant.

26
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:59,270
Well, I don't want to give any spoilers for people that haven't watched the direct,

27
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:10,629
but I'm missing somebody real important there, I think. Jerma's a plant. That's right. I'm

28
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:25,620
working. I'm working for him. Minecraft Steve. No, no way. What do you mean I wouldn't let

29
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,519
that happen? I don't work for Nintendo. No, I would never let that happen. This is not like

30
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:35,819
me playing Red Dead right now. What am I talking about? I would like I would talk to somebody.

31
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:46,329
Oh my fucking Jesus. Hold on. Thank you. Thank you. Jabba dab for your 10 community sub.

32
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:52,040
Thanks a lot, man. Thanks. Also, by the way, pocket Pauling. We didn't really touch upon your

33
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:58,379
$50 here. Like for real, thank you so much. Pocket Pauling for your 50 bucks and jabba

34
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:05,480
dab for your 10 community subs. And I think we I think we can go. You know what I'm

35
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:11,620
saying? I think we can just go. I got it. How do you ride the horse? I forget. Here we go.

36
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:21,670
What was I doing? Okay, I'm back in it. Is it x? I forget how to play. Do you just I just

37
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:31,019
woke up from a fucking dream. Okay, stalling. I don't remember how to shoot. I was in the

38
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:37,740
middle of the tutorial and I went into cryogenic sleep to get the train. You want to

39
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:43,829
head down? See how he's getting on? Okay. No, I remember. Okay, but I'm getting some

40
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:56,420
memories. Check on Bill. That's a gun. Okay. How do I take out the

41
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:06,389
doctor binocular? What was benign? Was there a binocular button? Do I do I go? Am I going

42
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:19,939
down? You know, I have to leave. I'm holding a knife. L one and R one. There we go. Okay.

43
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:41,990
Let's check on Bill. How's he doing? All right, put him up. Get on the horse.

44
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,750
This is I didn't even get to fucking do this. It's been four and a half days.

45
00:06:46,230 --> 00:07:03,589
No, god damn it. Okay, zoom. Where are you, Bill? This is this what I'm supposed to be doing.

46
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:16,360
Guys, give me a break. There he is. Okay. Where's he on the hill?

47
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:30,870
Okay, there he is. All right, spotted. I gotta I gotta move my horse out of here.

48
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:37,189
Set up the detonator by those rocks over there. Okay, sure. Now just unspool the wire and then

49
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:43,750
attach it to said detonator. I'm going to explode here. Pick up the spool.

50
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:54,810
I'm gonna I'm gonna like acme this guy. You're about to get wily coyote.

51
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:12,279
How much slack do we have? All right, here we go. Attach it.

52
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:28,490
This is attach the thing mini game or what? Okay. Okay. All right. Now stomp on detonator.

53
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:43,559
What if I just jump on this? Imagine if it just fucking blew up.

54
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:52,980
All right, I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. Put the horse on the tracks. I just got this

55
00:08:52,980 --> 00:09:04,730
horse. Why would I do something like that? I just bought the horse. All right, so I

56
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:09,690
have to detonate it. So I blow up the train. He says all fine. We'll soon find out.

57
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:18,009
Put yourself on the tracks. I think so. Okay, cover your faces. Train should be here any

58
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:34,470
minute now. Weapon wheel. So now we're looking for the detonator. The light.

59
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:48,419
I thought I had to like throw the fuse. It's not radio controlled.

60
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:59,320
Gentlemen, it's time. Good luck. All of you. You all know what to do.

61
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,279
I don't know. I actually don't because I saw the first part of this mission and story

62
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:13,620
almost four and a half, five days ago. Here we go. All right, that just didn't work.

63
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:26,789
Why are we getting off the horses? Wait, why would we get off the horse?

64
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,509
Jump on the train. How am I supposed to do that from here?

65
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:55,740
Okay, I've made it. Oh, running a train. All right, give me a Lenin. Pull, pull him.

66
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:02,779
Wait, oh, did he fall or did I fall?

67
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:16,059
Come on, this is what it's supposed to be doing, right? What? What am I doing?

68
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:32,230
Okay, I think I figured out what I'm supposed to do. What's the uh, okay.

69
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:39,940
All right, let's go. Stop the train. It's not TNT barrels here, right?

70
00:11:47,259 --> 00:12:02,889
I like the repeater. I was going for a tackle. All right, quick. I got to need something.

71
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:12,120
Give me some cover. Wait, wait, no, we gotta go. What the fuck?

72
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:17,259
I just got hit in the face with a shovel. Reverse the grapple.

73
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:34,570
Is this Abe Lincoln? All right, give it the front of the engine car.

74
00:12:44,009 --> 00:13:02,519
There's more. Right in the face. I have dead eye, so I don't know why I'm not using it

75
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,220
for some reason. What's the reload button?

76
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,419
Can I get like an ammo toss to me? That's it, right?

77
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:31,220
That guy. I need to pick up stuff on the ground. Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down.

78
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:47,529
Is that a person in the back? Is that an animal? That's a person. Oh shit. Oh shit. Get behind

79
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:56,330
this little fucking slab. Wait, this is our guys? Oh, these are our guys. All right. Wait,

80
00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:07,110
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I need to. It's a rock. It's a slab. That's a slab. Okay.

81
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:17,610
Assume yellow tonic to fortify your bars. A fortified bar can be used for a short period

82
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:23,289
without draining. This tonic will fortify your dead eye. Listen to me. Okay. We don't want to

83
00:14:23,289 --> 00:14:34,889
kill any of you. Any more of you. I give you my word, but trust me, we will. Boys,

84
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:48,250
okay. You asked for it. Five, three, two, one. Seems our friends have gone deaf.

85
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,929
I don't, I don't know what the, what the world war two plane sound was coming from outside.

86
00:14:52,649 --> 00:15:06,490
Are we going? I can't rapid fire this time. Mr. Williamson, give Mr. Morgan and Mr. Smith

87
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:12,539
some dynamite. You two boys go blow that door open. Why don't we do that? Thanks bill.

88
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:20,679
Much to us, but you boys in there might want to take a step back.

89
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,200
Place dynamite. Seems good enough. All right. Here we go. Like the views. Here we go.

90
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:39,419
All right. Now step back. Unless you got a death wish. I'd step back, fellas. Yeah,

91
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:45,590
I did this. I did this. All right. Now go in and just start firing.

92
00:15:54,570 --> 00:16:07,500
Blind him. Get on up and search that train. What's the punch button? I want to punch. It's

93
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:17,990
all right. Let's search the damn train. Look at this place. It's like a, it's beautiful in here.

94
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:23,750
You two got the safe. I'll search the rest. Oh yes. Should be easy as cake.

95
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:28,950
If I'm going to hide something, I would hide it inside the lamp.

96
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:35,590
Shut up. Me and Arthur did all the work. Yeah, kid did good. Didn't see you rushing to jump on

97
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:39,509
that train. He's king. I'll give you that. On receipt of funds, we proceed with phases two

98
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:42,070
and three of the project and present you with a detailed report of our findings within

99
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:47,429
the month. Yours, respectively. Okay, let's see if we can get this open. Now that wasn't part

100
00:16:47,429 --> 00:16:57,529
of it. Getting there. What's in there? Cigars? I can't carry any more of this item. I need

101
00:16:57,529 --> 00:17:13,319
to sell some shit then. Any codes? No, no codes. You can screenshot that and read it later if you

102
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:20,009
want. All right, there's brandy. I'm going to need to do something eventually here, food wise.

103
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:28,650
Can't carry any more of this item. Why not?

104
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:47,430
Can somebody else hold something? Money? That's money. Those are IOUs. No, it tells you. Bond.

105
00:17:56,569 --> 00:18:00,680
Is it really a lock box if it's unlocked? That's true.

106
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:08,650
What did you find? These. They worth anything? Oh, sure. Bearer bonds. I think we can probably

107
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:12,970
sell these pretty easily. Oh, wait, is that Ethereum? Well done. Now, would you get rid of

108
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:18,650
all of this? The train? Yeah, get it out of here. What about them? What do you think?

109
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:24,380
I don't know. It's up to you. Kill them, leave them here, take them with you on the train.

110
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:27,819
Just make sure they don't send our folk after us. Wait, I get temporary party members?

111
00:18:27,819 --> 00:18:31,180
Okay, see you back at camp. What do I do about these three?

112
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:41,980
We'll be moving on. The rest of you, let's ride. What do I do with my temporary party? Guard.

113
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:51,059
Deal with the guards. Can I pick who I threaten? Okay, get on the train. Quick.

114
00:18:58,819 --> 00:19:16,599
Wait, I gotta get you too. Hey, what's going on? What happened? What are the boundaries?

115
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:28,200
Why are the boundaries here? Oh, wait, wait, wait. Somebody gave 100 bucks.

116
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,440
Mega Mube just gave $100. Thank you so much, dude. Haven't been able to watch you stream

117
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,039
very much recently, but still love every second of the VODs. Hope this helps a little with

118
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:44,920
settling into the new place. Thank you. Thank you so much, Mega Mube. Well, you

119
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,720
haven't been able to watch very much recently. I haven't really been able to stream very

120
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,819
much recently. So all right, so let's do this the actual way I'm supposed to do it.

121
00:19:51,819 --> 00:19:58,730
Okay, get on the train. Quick. Any bright ideas? I kill all three. Yeah.

122
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:10,339
Oh, I don't have, I don't have anything else. Well, I want this instead. Get on the train.

123
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:22,390
I hear so much as a footstep from this car. You'll end up like all your friends out here.

124
00:20:23,109 --> 00:20:28,440
I have honor level. I told you to get on the train. Look, all you had, I'm not,

125
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:35,319
if you follow instructions, you're gonna be fine. How do I take, I need to go to the engine car?

126
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:48,150
What do they leave? What if they run away? I'm supposed to leave them back here? I don't know

127
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:53,900
if I want to do that. No, I'm not gonna, these guys listen. These guys follow directions.

128
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:22,410
Can I climb? What, what's going on? What was that? Okay, my horse is fine. How do I know

129
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:25,930
that they're gonna stay? Well, if I'm that guy, I'm just gonna walk off the train right

130
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:33,460
now. I'll know where to be found. They are running. What are you talking about? They're

131
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:49,509
running. No, that where? No, they're not. They're gonna remember this. That's fine.

132
00:21:50,069 --> 00:21:58,789
I want them to. One person said that. It doesn't matter how many people say it.

133
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:19,140
Let's get this thing moving. Why don't I stay on the train? If I'm one of these guys,

134
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:27,210
I'm gonna lean out the window and be like, sucker. I would throw a rock out the window at

135
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:35,460
him. As you're gonna get, you can catch the train. There's a bunch of heavy books in there.

136
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,779
I'd whip a book at him and try to hit him right in the head as hard as I could.

137
00:22:38,579 --> 00:22:45,190
I'd probably miss. You ever try to throw something as hard as you can at something

138
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,029
and you just do way off? That's what happens every time.

139
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:12,339
Not very nice. I'm an outlaw. You want me to tuck him into bed?

140
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:22,339
Yes.

141
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:54,539
Tuck him in nice. Well, that's a nice icy waterfall. I'm glad we're getting to the title

142
00:23:54,539 --> 00:24:17,900
screen song with lyrics because that's definitely where we are. This just sounds like somebody

143
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:23,819
that's at karaoke and they don't know the lyrics to the song for a whole portion and then

144
00:24:23,819 --> 00:24:30,619
she's going to sing the chorus. I don't even know the fucking chorus. Wow.

145
00:24:54,119 --> 00:25:20,390
That sounds pretty good. No, it's too easy. That's too easy. It's too easy to dump them

146
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:30,869
during the song. It's too easy. Wait. Oh, I thought the horse went through the earth. Hey, go.

147
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:42,839
I thought that the horse went all the way through. That was a preemptive.

148
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:46,279
I'm laughing. What the fuck? How do we lose a wheel?

149
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:51,430
Okay. Let's take a look.

150
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:52,230
That's supposed to happen.

151
00:25:53,529 --> 00:25:56,890
What's going on? I broke the goddamn wheel.

152
00:25:58,009 --> 00:26:02,009
Let's get it fixed. You need help? I reckon we can handle it.

153
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:27,430
Okay. Lift it up. I'm playing house slipper again. That's all it takes. Oh yeah. This

154
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:33,109
is back in like the 1100s, right? The wheel was just invented.

155
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:36,539
Of course they're going to have technical problems with it.

156
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:20,789
Here comes the whole story. Back to the wagon.

157
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,559
You can switch between different radar sizes in the compass by holding that.

158
00:27:33,589 --> 00:27:40,490
Expand. No, no, no. Regular is fine. I'll keep it on regular. That's fine.

159
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:43,289
The Indians in these parts got sold a very raw deal.

160
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:48,299
This is the heartland we're going to. Good farming and grazing country.

161
00:27:49,339 --> 00:27:52,220
We're just browsing around right now. We can take our time here.

162
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:57,900
Every blade of grass killed or heard it up to the reservations in the middle of nowhere.

163
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:03,000
It's not different from anywhere else. This is more scenic. Maybe it's not.

164
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,680
Kangaroo. Kangaroo. Get the kangaroo.

165
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,839
I'm sure some of the army out here was particularly

166
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:14,490
That's a four legged kangaroo. How do I take out my gun?

167
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:21,960
I fear I was perhaps trying to simplify something more complicated

168
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,759
for the benefit of our block headed driver here.

169
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:27,720
Hey, hey, don't blame it on me.

170
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:33,160
Never forget. This here's a con man, Charles. Born and bred.

171
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:40,039
Just because it sounds fancy don't mean he knows a damn thing about what he's talking about.

172
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:41,880
I'm trying. I'm just going regular speed.

173
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:46,259
So what happened to your tribe?

174
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:50,710
I don't even know. At least not that I can remember.

175
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:53,319
My father was a cousin.

176
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:56,759
Yes, the southern kangaroo. We just ran a squirrel over.

177
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:57,960
A number of freemen did.

178
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,740
Move from our land. Three of us fled.

179
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,940
You got to know a family of like four is going to drive by then.

180
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:09,619
They're all going to turn their heads and go, oh, no.

181
00:29:09,619 --> 00:29:12,099
A couple years later, some soldiers captured my mother.

182
00:29:12,099 --> 00:29:15,220
Took her somewhere. We never saw her again.

183
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,400
We drifted around. He was a very sad man.

184
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,559
Where clothes appropriate to move around.

185
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:24,940
I'm 13. I just took off on my own.

186
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,779
That was about the age we found young Arthur here.

187
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:30,759
Maybe a little older. Delinquent.

188
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:33,400
You never did see. But he learned fast.

189
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:36,710
Not as fast as Marston, apparently.

190
00:29:37,589 --> 00:29:39,589
Wait. I don't understand.

191
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,910
What's the problem between you two?

192
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:42,630
Nice shot.

193
00:29:43,509 --> 00:29:45,029
It's a long story.

194
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,220
Do a flip with the carriage.

195
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,140
We still heading the right way?

196
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:55,700
That depends. Are we still heading west in search of fortune

197
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,660
and repose in virgin forests as we plan?

198
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:02,019
No. Are we heading in the correct direction

199
00:30:02,019 --> 00:30:05,220
on our desperate escape from the law eastwards down the mountain?

200
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,259
We're going the right way still.

201
00:30:06,259 --> 00:30:08,019
Yes, I believe so.

202
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:09,460
You know this area?

203
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:12,019
A little. I've been through a couple of times.

204
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:16,180
There's a livestock town not too far from here called Valentine.

205
00:30:16,819 --> 00:30:20,099
Cowboys, outlaws, working girls.

206
00:30:20,099 --> 00:30:21,140
Our kind of place.

207
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,259
This is boring?

208
00:30:24,259 --> 00:30:25,619
Hey, we're doing the tutorial, man.

209
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:26,740
We're just trying to enjoy the game.

210
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,019
In this place, we're going.

211
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,900
Wait, what's it called again?

212
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,259
Horseshoe Overlook.

213
00:30:32,259 --> 00:30:33,460
I don't think I can even control this.

214
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,339
Is this a good place to lie low?

215
00:30:34,339 --> 00:30:34,980
It'll do for now.

216
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,579
I can't go anywhere because I'm straight.

217
00:30:36,579 --> 00:30:38,819
How long do you think Dutch is really going to lie?

218
00:30:39,859 --> 00:30:44,099
It's just, you know, maybe it's me who's changed, not him.

219
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:48,099
But we kept telling him that fairy job didn't feel right.

220
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,619
You and me had a real lead in Blackwater that could have worked out.

221
00:30:53,539 --> 00:30:56,019
It just isn't like Dutch to lose his head like that.

222
00:30:56,019 --> 00:30:57,380
When do we fight the wild west orcs?

223
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:02,650
Things go wrong sometimes. It's the way it is.

224
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:03,130
What?

225
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:05,099
It always has been.

226
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:06,700
This isn't like Skyrim.

227
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:11,480
Dutch, abandon this line of work.

228
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:23,029
We're still here, so I figure we must have got a ride to hell.

229
00:31:23,029 --> 00:31:24,470
Who's eating?

230
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,920
We work here anyway.

231
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,559
Just some yarrow and ginseng.

232
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:30,279
Good for the health.

233
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,559
Better than that stuff you buy in the store.

234
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,720
Yeah, you can have all this.

235
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:39,319
I'm at the point where I can do it with my eyes closed.

236
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:41,880
Why don't you just wish sometimes that you could just eat this and be fine?

237
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:48,920
Eating sometimes is just a pain in the ass, don't you guys think?

238
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:55,579
I mean, I love food, but they're going to be annoying.

239
00:31:55,579 --> 00:31:56,700
It's something you have to do.

240
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,500
It's like sleeping.

241
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,500
Think about your entire day.

242
00:32:01,779 --> 00:32:04,980
Like 60% of your whole day is eating and sleeping.

243
00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:06,420
Come on, man.

244
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:09,500
Like, where's the science there?

245
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:09,980
Let's go.

246
00:32:25,849 --> 00:32:26,890
Oh, boy.

247
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:28,329
This discussion again.

248
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:35,990
So just stop eating.

249
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:36,869
What's the big deal?

250
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:52,940
Oh, stop the wagon.

251
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:56,839
Turn and stop.

252
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,069
Stop.

253
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,359
Do I have to back it up?

254
00:33:07,829 --> 00:33:08,630
All right, back up.

255
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:17,779
Where is he?

256
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:22,089
He's right around this rock.

257
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,880
Telephone's ringing.

258
00:33:29,589 --> 00:33:30,069
All right.

259
00:33:30,069 --> 00:33:31,269
There he is over here, right?

260
00:33:33,819 --> 00:33:34,380
Where is he?

261
00:33:35,019 --> 00:33:35,980
Oh, my God.

262
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,099
Where is he?

263
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:42,740
Wasn't he right here?

264
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:51,049
Look at the map.

265
00:33:51,049 --> 00:33:53,529
I mean, yeah, but oh, there he is.

266
00:33:53,529 --> 00:33:55,769
He just he got stuck in my shit, so he started walking.

267
00:33:56,569 --> 00:34:02,119
All right, get on.

268
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,480
Can I beep?

269
00:34:11,289 --> 00:34:12,090
Run him over.

270
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:14,090
No, I have to be like at least a decent person.

271
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:15,369
All right, get on.

272
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:24,780
Get on.

273
00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:28,070
Where's the beep?

274
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,230
How do I beep at this guy?

275
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:47,480
Where is he?

276
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,679
Where did he disappear?

277
00:34:58,119 --> 00:34:59,320
All right, we made it.

278
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:01,159
Home sweet home.

279
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:01,960
There we are.

280
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,000
Good thing you made it.

281
00:35:11,619 --> 00:35:12,579
He made it before we did.

282
00:35:13,139 --> 00:35:22,500
I've never seen somebody fuck this section up.

283
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,380
Well, have you ever seen somebody do that whole section in cinematic mode?

284
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,079
Now you have it.

285
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:33,480
Now you have it.

286
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:33,880
Now you have it.

287
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,199
Now you have it.

288
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:34,599
Now you have it.

289
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:50,570
Every last one of us kept us together, kept us alive, kept the nooses off our neck.

290
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:53,289
I guess I'm just worried.

291
00:35:53,929 --> 00:35:55,369
I ain't got that long, Dutch.

292
00:35:55,369 --> 00:35:57,050
I want folks safe before I go.

293
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:57,769
Me too.

294
00:35:57,769 --> 00:36:00,730
And now we are stuck east of the Grizzlies and out of money

295
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:05,050
and a long way from our dream of virgin land in the west.

296
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:08,409
I know, my brother, but we are safe.

297
00:36:08,409 --> 00:36:12,090
We make a bit of money here, then we move again, head out around

298
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:12,489
Nice.

299
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:13,929
West of Uncle Sam.

300
00:36:13,929 --> 00:36:16,809
That's really hard to do by some land.

301
00:36:16,809 --> 00:36:17,449
I hope so.

302
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:21,769
Would you just look around you?

303
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:26,139
This world has its consolation.

304
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:31,880
Gentlemen, I'm going to head into the local town and, you know,

305
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:34,760
see if I can strike up a little business.

306
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:39,400
Of course, hair strows up for robbing banks to usury.

307
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:42,280
Seems more dignified somehow.

308
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:47,000
Now, everyone, put your tools down for a moment.

309
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,079
Come on, gather around quickly now.

310
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:50,199
I'm going to get a speech.

311
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:54,280
I know that things have been tough, but we are free.

312
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,599
Oh, coming in with five community subs.

313
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:59,750
Thanks a lot, man.

314
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,150
For everyone to get to work.

315
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:04,070
Get to work, but stay out of trouble.

316
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,630
Remember, we are itinerant workers.

317
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:10,389
Laid off when they shut down our factory to the north.

318
00:37:10,389 --> 00:37:13,750
Now, get out there and see what you can find.

319
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:17,190
Uncle, Reverend Swanson, no more passengers.

320
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:23,429
It is time for everyone to earn their keep.

321
00:37:23,429 --> 00:37:26,949
There is a town a little way down the track named of Valentine.

322
00:37:26,949 --> 00:37:27,510
Can you play?

323
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,550
I'm playing the game.

324
00:37:31,269 --> 00:37:31,909
This is the game.

325
00:37:31,909 --> 00:37:33,190
That seems a decent place to start.

326
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:35,989
And we need food, real food.

327
00:37:35,989 --> 00:37:38,070
That means every day, one of you.

328
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:40,869
Now, remember, whatever it is that you find.

329
00:37:40,869 --> 00:37:44,869
Can't have gifts, gifts, slice.

330
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,590
Now, be sensible out there.

331
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:51,449
Now, the girls have your tent ready, Mr. Morgan.

332
00:37:51,449 --> 00:37:51,929
Come with me.

333
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,250
You threw away the shorty.

334
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,210
We put you over here.

335
00:37:55,769 --> 00:37:59,050
I'm sure everything will be fine, Miss Grimshaw.

336
00:37:59,050 --> 00:37:59,690
It should be.

337
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:01,849
Most of your stuff from Blackwater got saved.

338
00:38:01,849 --> 00:38:03,530
Everything apart from my money.

339
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:04,889
Oh, don't remind me.

340
00:38:04,889 --> 00:38:07,369
Well, we can always make more money.

341
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:08,250
We're going to have to.

342
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:12,409
Miss Jackson, I've seen shit with more common sense.

343
00:38:12,409 --> 00:38:14,250
Sleep shame or change clothes at your tent.

344
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,400
Burz, I don't know why for a second,

345
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,679
I thought he was going to burn his clothes.

346
00:38:19,849 --> 00:38:21,130
I'm done with these.

347
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:22,329
I think I'm going to get rid of them.

348
00:38:23,449 --> 00:38:29,369
Horseshoe Overlook, chapter two.

349
00:38:29,369 --> 00:38:30,250
That was chapter one?

350
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,449
How many chapters are there?

351
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:37,000
That's not how you guys change clothes.

352
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:41,610
What did they do before?

353
00:38:42,969 --> 00:38:43,690
No, never mind.

354
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:45,050
That's a stupid thing to say.

355
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:46,889
What did they do before?

356
00:38:46,889 --> 00:38:47,389
Laundry.

357
00:38:47,389 --> 00:38:47,889
Laundry.

358
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:49,789
They just left this clothes on.

359
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,800
You rinsed it in a stream.

360
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,519
Funny guys, funny number joke.

361
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,539
So this is a few weeks later.

362
00:39:25,849 --> 00:39:29,050
Eat, drink, play at Dave and Busters.

363
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,530
You got to maintain your course, don't you?

364
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:36,250
Half price Wednesdays.

365
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:39,210
Oh, by the way, half price is actually what it should be every day

366
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,610
because it's like four dollars to play one game here.

367
00:39:45,289 --> 00:39:45,849
Don't come here.

368
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:56,960
What are you saying?

369
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,519
You guys don't have, you never played, you went to Dave and Busters?

370
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:01,039
Camera.

371
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:04,239
Your games can't be shown by a symbol on the map.

372
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:08,039
Eagle talent, talisman.

373
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:10,039
Okay, so your beard is getting long.

374
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:11,400
You can use the shaving kit beside your tent

375
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,079
or visit a barbershop to maintain your facial hair.

376
00:40:21,849 --> 00:40:23,130
Okay, there's lots of details here.

377
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:23,849
Hold on.

378
00:40:23,849 --> 00:40:29,099
So we got permanently increases the time

379
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:31,179
that eagle eye can stay active for five seconds.

380
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,400
Crafted from rare legendary animal parts.

381
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:38,059
Permanently decreases the damage the player receives

382
00:40:38,059 --> 00:40:39,420
while on horseback by 10 percent.

383
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,900
Okay, that's interesting.

384
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,019
You can make little charms.

385
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,170
178 animals.

386
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:48,820
What?

387
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,679
There were like four in the last game.

388
00:40:53,579 --> 00:41:00,539
Deer, bear, coyote, and like rabbit, right?

389
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,659
Six gangs, 30 fish, 74 pieces of equipment.

390
00:41:05,659 --> 00:41:06,539
This seems huge.

391
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:14,219
Hey, I discovered the deer and the bears.

392
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,420
Where's the bear?

393
00:41:16,139 --> 00:41:18,699
How have I not discovered the bear?

394
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,280
I literally shot him in the face with an arrow.

395
00:41:24,139 --> 00:41:25,099
It's easy to track them.

396
00:41:28,909 --> 00:41:29,469
Okay, I see.

397
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:30,780
All right.

398
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:38,280
Bring Pearson animals to supply the camp.

399
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,320
You can use the meat for food

400
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,639
and the skins to craft satchels with increased capacity.

401
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:44,480
All right, there's a lot going on.

402
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,039
Let me take a look.

403
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:48,000
I don't care what that guy has to say right now.

404
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,539
Let's do some shaving.

405
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:53,150
Now, is this like...

406
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,630
Is this like the...

407
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:56,750
You guys remember...

408
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,190
No one's going to know what I'm talking about here.

409
00:41:58,829 --> 00:42:02,409
The magnet face thing

410
00:42:02,409 --> 00:42:04,489
where you have the magnet hair on the guy's face.

411
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:10,889
It was like a 14 cent toy length.

412
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,360
Oh, you actually can do this.

413
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,469
Hold on, chin.

414
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,260
I think I just want a dirty chin.

415
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,059
I don't know.

416
00:42:32,059 --> 00:42:32,780
What do you think?

417
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,440
Just gigantic chops?

418
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:38,530
Hmm.

419
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,280
No, I just want the piece of hair

420
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,039
from my chin to go down as far as it can go.

421
00:42:50,409 --> 00:42:50,909
Yeah.

422
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,719
I'm going to look like an Amish guy.

423
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:15,599
Thanos.

424
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:23,789
Can I dye my whole face purple and my beard purple?

425
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:26,960
Yeah, that's good.

426
00:43:28,219 --> 00:43:29,019
Okay.

427
00:43:29,019 --> 00:43:30,719
I like it like this so far.

428
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:33,849
I'm going to keep that going as long as it can go.

429
00:43:37,769 --> 00:43:42,409
The current stock levels are shown when near the tithing box.

430
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:44,519
All right, let's take a look.

431
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:48,400
Now, that's perfectly balanced facial hair.

432
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:51,960
Here's something to make a stew.

433
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:52,920
You can eat from the pot.

434
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,179
I'm getting a lot of info here.

435
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,679
They demanded no.

436
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:09,840
It's like lore in case you want to see it.

437
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,579
Let me just like take it in for a second here

438
00:44:15,579 --> 00:44:16,780
because here's the donation box.

439
00:44:17,659 --> 00:44:19,500
How much money should I give?

440
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:21,019
Contribute.

441
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,050
How much can I contribute?

442
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:25,400
Are you going to serve them?

443
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,360
If I don't give money.

444
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,489
It'll be ready.

445
00:44:28,489 --> 00:44:28,989
Okay.

446
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:39,920
I did my...

447
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:42,619
Somebody's...

448
00:44:43,159 --> 00:44:45,639
Somebody's slurping out of a big gulp?

449
00:44:45,639 --> 00:44:46,360
What the hell was that?

450
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:55,000
It was a radio.

451
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,079
I thought somebody said like a giant soda.

452
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:04,170
Let's keep looking around.

453
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:04,670
Hold on.

454
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:05,769
Food.

455
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:06,650
Let me eat some stew.

456
00:45:09,659 --> 00:45:10,780
That's less than a hundred bits.

457
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:11,500
I ain't going to read it.

458
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:13,050
Let's see.

459
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:13,610
It's a stew.

460
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:14,489
What kind of stew is it?

461
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:22,730
Is it not done?

462
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:28,639
I want some of that.

463
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,320
How do I get some of that?

464
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:38,650
Oh, okay.

465
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:39,050
I have to take...

466
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:40,409
I have to actually pick the bowl up.

467
00:45:40,409 --> 00:45:43,449
This is the two parts here.

468
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:48,699
I only get to eat once every few days.

469
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:56,730
I can just walk around and talk while eating.

470
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:00,829
All right.

471
00:46:00,829 --> 00:46:01,550
This is pretty cool.

472
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:01,949
All right.

473
00:46:01,949 --> 00:46:02,429
This is good.

474
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:09,869
Can I throw it like acid?

475
00:46:09,869 --> 00:46:10,909
Can I throw it in somebody's face?

476
00:46:17,469 --> 00:46:17,869
I want to talk.

477
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:20,800
All right.

478
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,440
I'm going to sit here.

479
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:30,349
Am I allowed at this part at the lunch table?

480
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:34,909
What the fuck?

481
00:46:34,909 --> 00:46:35,869
Nobody wants to talk to me.

482
00:46:37,309 --> 00:46:39,309
I can't sit with the cool kids at the lunch table?

483
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:51,840
Hey.

484
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:52,960
No, I wasn't done with that.

485
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,159
Sit back down and eat the rest of that.

486
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:03,880
Okay.

487
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:04,280
I can talk.

488
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,320
I can see anything when you rode ahead.

489
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,679
Nothing we need to worry about.

490
00:47:08,679 --> 00:47:09,719
Okay.

491
00:47:09,719 --> 00:47:10,039
Good.

492
00:47:13,019 --> 00:47:13,500
That was a...

493
00:47:14,219 --> 00:47:16,380
That was as shitty as a conversation as

494
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,139
what's the weather like in this...

495
00:47:18,139 --> 00:47:19,099
Look at that weather, huh?

496
00:47:20,059 --> 00:47:23,320
I only get to eat once every three days

497
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,599
and I'm going to leave half my plate.

498
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,480
What am I?

499
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,360
At the olive garden?

500
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,519
Okay.

501
00:47:35,239 --> 00:47:36,960
What's over here?

502
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:45,519
Oh, this guy.

503
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:46,800
This is the guy shaving the turkey.

504
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:48,840
Crafting upgrades.

505
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:49,239
Donate.

506
00:47:49,239 --> 00:47:53,719
I'm going to meet here soon if we're not careful.

507
00:47:53,719 --> 00:47:56,440
Well, let's get some meat so we get a feather.

508
00:47:58,619 --> 00:47:59,019
You can have...

509
00:48:01,789 --> 00:48:02,989
You can have a bird feather.

510
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:07,420
Thank you.

511
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:10,170
I'm getting money here.

512
00:48:11,449 --> 00:48:12,250
Donate all.

513
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:13,369
Donate for provisions.

514
00:48:14,329 --> 00:48:15,210
I think I want to do that.

515
00:48:15,769 --> 00:48:20,860
Donated.

516
00:48:21,579 --> 00:48:22,619
Just bring me meat.

517
00:48:22,619 --> 00:48:23,179
Donated.

518
00:48:23,179 --> 00:48:24,059
I'm just going to give it to him.

519
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:28,679
This is fish meat.

520
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,719
Two pieces of meat.

521
00:48:31,719 --> 00:48:32,920
And we got some venison here.

522
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:36,809
Can I like cook on the...

523
00:48:36,809 --> 00:48:37,929
I'm just going to give them all.

524
00:48:37,929 --> 00:48:38,650
Just take it all.

525
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:41,869
Don't say like I never gave you nothing.

526
00:48:41,869 --> 00:48:46,190
Just take it.

527
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:51,070
Oh, shit.

528
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:51,630
Okay, hold on.

529
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:54,730
Can I not give these?

530
00:48:55,769 --> 00:49:00,139
All right, so crafting upgrades.

531
00:49:00,139 --> 00:49:00,940
Let's see what I can do here.

532
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:03,579
I'm very into my crafting at the moment, Mr. Morgan.

533
00:49:03,579 --> 00:49:04,860
Okay, so craft satchel.

534
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:06,059
Increase carrying capacity.

535
00:49:07,179 --> 00:49:09,849
Tonic satchel.

536
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:12,329
I can't do any of these.

537
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:15,659
Oh, god damn it.

538
00:49:15,659 --> 00:49:16,219
I need like...

539
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:19,360
Fusion cannot craft this yet.

540
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,239
I can't craft any of these.

541
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,429
Okay.

542
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:26,780
So I need to purchase leather working tools

543
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:28,380
and upgrade the medicine wagon twice.

544
00:49:29,579 --> 00:49:30,780
I got so much work to do.

545
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:31,900
There's a lot of work here.

546
00:49:32,699 --> 00:49:34,750
I can make my own house.

547
00:49:35,469 --> 00:49:40,480
I need one perfect ram carcass.

548
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,400
Cleaned up ram skull to be displayed at your tent.

549
00:49:46,679 --> 00:49:47,320
Rugs.

550
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,119
I don't have anything.

551
00:49:49,789 --> 00:49:51,949
Upgrade the main camp's campfire.

552
00:49:52,909 --> 00:49:55,690
I don't have any of this shit.

553
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:56,969
I need to like play the game first.

554
00:49:59,159 --> 00:50:00,519
All right, well, thanks for the money.

555
00:50:01,159 --> 00:50:03,320
What about you?

556
00:50:06,619 --> 00:50:08,110
Oh, there's a guy over here.

557
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:09,949
What do the exclamation points mean?

558
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:13,659
Oh, these are provisions or something, right?

559
00:50:14,619 --> 00:50:16,139
I can take a certain amount of provisions every day.

560
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:18,300
I'm assuming they're not grayed out.

561
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:22,800
Right, that would make sense, wouldn't it?

562
00:50:24,539 --> 00:50:25,980
Needs to be restocked.

563
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:26,699
Okay.

564
00:50:26,699 --> 00:50:27,500
Well, I'm just gonna go.

565
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:28,940
Let's do a mission.

566
00:50:29,579 --> 00:50:34,559
Where's my horse?

567
00:50:40,139 --> 00:50:41,659
Do the mission, do the mission.

568
00:50:41,659 --> 00:50:43,260
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

569
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:45,900
How are we doing on our stamina?

570
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:49,530
You can command your horse to stay, flee, or follow

571
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:51,369
by focusing on it with the L2 when it's nearby.

572
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:53,769
Yes.

573
00:50:53,769 --> 00:50:57,820
I, I'm on it currently.

574
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:01,900
All right, so we got G, E, U, or R, S.

575
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:04,699
We're gonna, we're gonna go towards G, E.

576
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,179
Galloping horses cause stamina to drain.

577
00:51:15,179 --> 00:51:15,420
Hold on.

578
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:15,980
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

579
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:18,619
173 bullets.

580
00:51:18,619 --> 00:51:19,900
41, 173.

581
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:25,820
Okay, I have ammo, so I'm just gonna go.

582
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:30,800
Hold X to maintain the horse's canter

583
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:31,679
and punch some stamina.

584
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:32,079
Sounds good.

585
00:51:39,469 --> 00:51:43,920
The world has opened up now.

586
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,920
We're going to the first mission.

587
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:56,860
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

588
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:57,820
No, no, no, no, no, no.

589
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:58,780
Wait, wait, wait, an animal.

590
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:00,619
An animal I can, I can take and bring back to the,

591
00:52:00,619 --> 00:52:01,739
to the, what is it?

592
00:52:01,739 --> 00:52:02,699
It's a turkey.

593
00:52:02,699 --> 00:52:03,340
It's a turkey.

594
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,079
Study the turkey.

595
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,320
Where is it?

596
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:11,800
There it is.

597
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:12,280
Study it.

598
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:14,889
Can I talk to them?

599
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:17,449
How did you, I ran it over.

600
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:22,760
All right, let's go study them.

601
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:40,360
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

602
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:40,920
Bird meat.

603
00:52:41,559 --> 00:52:43,000
When you skin or pluck an animal,

604
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,519
you take meat from the car cause you can cook

605
00:52:44,519 --> 00:52:45,880
and eat this meat at a campfire.

606
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:46,840
I, we need to take this back.

607
00:52:47,719 --> 00:52:53,800
Can I like throw it at somebody?

608
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:55,960
No, that's a gun.

609
00:52:56,679 --> 00:52:57,719
All right, we're going to take this back.

610
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:04,489
All right, there's another one over here.

611
00:53:04,489 --> 00:53:05,210
Where's the other turkey?

612
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:11,099
Pick up and examine.

613
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:14,059
So it's a random wild mushroom.

614
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:20,809
Parasol mushroom is a health herb.

615
00:53:20,809 --> 00:53:22,329
It can be eaten to refill your health core

616
00:53:22,329 --> 00:53:23,769
or be crafted to as bait.

617
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:25,210
What can I eat?

618
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:26,829
What do I eat?

619
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:30,960
This is dangerous.

620
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:31,440
I don't know why.

621
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,960
I don't think anyone should do this.

622
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,420
Oh, we're fine.

623
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:36,829
Okay, give me the other turkey.

624
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:40,510
This time I'm not going to skin this one.

625
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:41,309
I'm going to bring this back to,

626
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:42,909
but I don't know what his name is.

627
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:51,900
Who's that?

628
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:56,750
Who's this guy?

629
00:53:56,989 --> 00:53:58,269
Come on, boy.

630
00:53:58,269 --> 00:54:02,699
You think I got a problem?

631
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:05,360
He ain't getting either one of these turkeys.

632
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,480
I'm guaranteeing you that.

633
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:18,480
How many turkeys can I put on one horse?

634
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:27,340
Get lost.

635
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:28,880
I'm all in mess with you.

636
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:29,920
I'm just messing with you.

637
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:34,219
I'm just messing with you, dude.

638
00:54:35,019 --> 00:54:35,579
Like I...

639
00:54:35,579 --> 00:54:42,409
Hey, move it.

640
00:54:42,409 --> 00:54:43,210
Hold on, you can...

641
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:44,409
How do I rob him?

642
00:54:44,409 --> 00:54:45,289
Calm it.

643
00:54:45,289 --> 00:54:50,380
I'll shoot you like a sick-ass...

644
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:54,719
Oh, no, wait.

645
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:55,599
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

646
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:02,880
No, I didn't...

647
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:03,599
Just stop moving.

648
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:10,559
Where's it going?

649
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:11,360
G-E...

650
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,079
That guy.

651
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:13,199
Wait, that guy might have something.

652
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,079
Oh, there's a witness.

653
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:18,780
The horse is the witness?

654
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:20,539
It's this guy.

655
00:55:21,179 --> 00:55:25,019
Stop.

656
00:55:25,019 --> 00:55:25,420
Hands up.

657
00:55:26,059 --> 00:55:28,119
Get your hands in the air.

658
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:31,869
Stop.

659
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:34,460
Stop it.

660
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:35,500
I don't want to have to do this.

661
00:55:36,219 --> 00:55:40,780
Stop.

662
00:55:47,659 --> 00:55:48,539
Stop moving.

663
00:56:00,329 --> 00:56:00,969
Come on, now.

664
00:56:01,769 --> 00:56:18,429
What do you have?

665
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:19,949
Hey.

666
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:24,280
All right, I gotta get rid of this guy.

667
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:29,440
Is this like Hitman?

668
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,360
Do I have to like bury him somewhere?

669
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:36,800
He's hidden in the...

670
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:37,840
He's hidden in the trees.

671
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,840
No more witnesses.

672
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:40,719
We're good.

673
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:46,840
What was he doing?

674
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,400
Oh, this way.

675
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:47,639
Okay.

676
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,239
You can't skin a person.

677
00:56:52,239 --> 00:56:53,280
What are you talking about?

678
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,079
Wait, we're going this way.

679
00:57:04,989 --> 00:57:08,989
You can't just like rob and kill every person.

680
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,599
There are turkeys over here anyways,

681
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:13,480
and that's what we care about.

682
00:57:15,389 --> 00:57:21,449
Where'd they go up here?

683
00:57:21,449 --> 00:57:25,719
I don't see anybody.

684
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:28,780
No, they got away.

685
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:29,260
That's okay.

686
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:34,300
Study.

687
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:35,260
Wait, I can study sheep?

688
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:39,610
Ooh.

689
00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:41,210
Hold binoculars while looking at them.

690
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:53,130
I don't understand.

691
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:53,610
Does that work?

692
00:57:54,329 --> 00:58:05,210
I don't think it worked.

693
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:08,730
Don't eat them?

694
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:10,570
What am I, the big bad wolf?

695
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:13,820
Okay, slow down.

696
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:14,139
No, no, no.

697
00:58:14,139 --> 00:58:15,260
I'll get in trouble here.

698
00:58:17,659 --> 00:58:19,659
Animals attached to your horse will decompose.

699
00:58:19,659 --> 00:58:20,619
Sell them before this happens.

700
00:58:20,619 --> 00:58:21,340
Oh, shit.

701
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:22,139
I need to sell these.

702
00:58:29,369 --> 00:58:30,090
Study quick.

703
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:30,969
Come here.

704
00:58:30,969 --> 00:58:31,210
Come here.

705
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:31,610
Come here.

706
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:31,849
No.

707
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:34,480
Got it.

708
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:40,460
All right, let's go.

709
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,840
That was a shot in the dark completely.

710
00:58:50,699 --> 00:58:51,099
Made it.

711
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:55,210
I don't know how fast I can like full sprint over here though.

712
00:58:55,210 --> 00:58:55,610
There we go.

713
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:56,010
We're good.

714
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:00,639
Pitch the horse.

715
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,440
Now we're at the general store.

716
00:59:05,559 --> 00:59:07,869
I need the turkey.

717
00:59:07,869 --> 00:59:08,269
Turkeys.

718
00:59:08,269 --> 00:59:08,829
I need both.

719
00:59:08,829 --> 00:59:09,469
I need a turkey.

720
00:59:10,269 --> 00:59:10,590
Okay.

721
00:59:11,309 --> 00:59:12,510
I got fresh turkeys here.

722
00:59:14,329 --> 00:59:16,409
And I'm willing to sell it for a moderate price.

723
00:59:26,039 --> 00:59:26,679
What?

724
00:59:26,679 --> 00:59:28,760
Hey, what am I, what are you, what?

725
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,110
I'm trying to sell you a turkey, man.

726
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,070
Oh, don't do that.

727
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,190
I'll kick you out.

728
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:35,980
You can interact with the shopkeeper

729
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:36,860
by approaching the catalog.

730
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:42,059
What?

731
00:59:42,059 --> 00:59:45,559
I just got kicked out for bringing a turkey?

732
00:59:46,519 --> 00:59:49,789
Where's the butcher?

733
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:51,070
Pardon me.

734
00:59:53,179 --> 00:59:53,820
God damn it.

735
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:54,139
Come here.

736
00:59:54,139 --> 00:59:54,539
Let's go.

737
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:57,340
All right, here we go.

738
00:59:58,679 --> 00:59:59,960
Hey, I got a...

739
01:00:00,679 --> 01:00:02,190
You can interact with the shopkeeper.

740
01:00:02,190 --> 01:00:02,829
All right, let's go.

741
01:00:02,829 --> 01:00:03,949
I'm gonna throw it down on here.

742
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:06,800
I got some quality meat here.

743
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:12,889
All right, I don't, I,

744
01:00:12,889 --> 01:00:14,010
I don't have to walk it over here.

745
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:14,250
Okay.

746
01:00:15,789 --> 01:00:16,750
Sales of turkey meat.

747
01:00:17,469 --> 01:00:21,070
Salted beef.

748
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:21,869
I'm gonna keep that.

749
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:25,519
Turkey feathers.

750
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:27,789
50 cents.

751
01:00:27,789 --> 01:00:28,190
That's not bad.

752
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:28,670
That's pretty good.

753
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:34,170
To sell a pellet stored on the back of your horse,

754
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:35,449
take your horse close to the butcher.

755
01:00:35,449 --> 01:00:36,329
Oh, I gotta get the horse.

756
01:00:41,389 --> 01:00:41,710
Native.

757
01:00:42,349 --> 01:00:43,320
All right, horse cargo.

758
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,440
What does he got on there?

759
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,670
Ooh, look at all this stuff.

760
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:49,719
I have so much shit here.

761
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,280
I got two championship belts.

762
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,559
I don't think I can sell any of these.

763
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:57,039
Maybe I can.

764
01:00:57,679 --> 01:00:58,400
Time game?

765
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:01,150
I feel like I shouldn't sell these.

766
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:02,030
I'm probably gonna need them.

767
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:07,400
All right, let's go find Mr. G.E.

768
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,400
Glips indicate optional stranger missions.

769
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:10,280
Speak to the stranger.

770
01:01:12,539 --> 01:01:13,340
Question mark, Glip.

771
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:17,389
Do you see, I don't see one of them.

772
01:01:17,389 --> 01:01:18,909
Do you see a question mark, Glip?

773
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:24,730
I don't see one.

774
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:28,039
All right, let's just go.

775
01:01:28,039 --> 01:01:28,760
Let's go find this guy.

776
01:01:29,659 --> 01:01:30,780
I don't think he's in the store.

777
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:31,420
Probably down here.

778
01:01:32,219 --> 01:01:33,739
I need new clothes.

779
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:35,260
I don't know.

780
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:35,980
I guess it is.

781
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:37,340
He's in this saloon.

782
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,400
The psycho in me just wants to throw a chair in here.

783
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:50,679
But I can't.

784
01:01:50,679 --> 01:01:52,039
No, not yet.

785
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:08,360
Yes, he's a pussy cat.

786
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,800
Ain't that so, Arthur?

787
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:10,599
Whatever you say.

788
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:13,000
How much you cost, anyway?

789
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,559
Ain't that a nice way to talk to a lady?

790
01:02:15,559 --> 01:02:17,960
Oh, I didn't know I was talking to a lady.

791
01:02:18,519 --> 01:02:19,159
Excuse me.

792
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:23,159
Well, I must say,

793
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:25,960
you got a fine way with the women, amigo.

794
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:28,650
They're dandy and a charm.

795
01:02:29,369 --> 01:02:30,090
What's in there?

796
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:30,650
Chocolate milk?

797
01:02:30,650 --> 01:02:31,769
Oh, man.

798
01:02:31,769 --> 01:02:33,050
I dread to think about it.

799
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:38,860
Hey, you motherfucker.

800
01:02:42,349 --> 01:02:43,150
Barroom brawl.

801
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:44,030
This is where it starts.

802
01:02:44,829 --> 01:02:50,079
This is what you came for.

803
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,360
This is for me to get my ass kicked.

804
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:04,090
What do you got?

805
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:05,469
Oh, what's that?

806
01:03:05,469 --> 01:03:06,429
You just got dodged?

807
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:10,679
How do I pick up a chair?

808
01:03:11,239 --> 01:03:12,119
Come on.

809
01:03:12,119 --> 01:03:13,639
There's going to be something I can do here.

810
01:03:13,639 --> 01:03:17,679
Wait, who's that?

811
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:21,179
Who is that guy?

812
01:03:21,179 --> 01:03:22,139
Uh-oh, here's the boss.

813
01:03:28,829 --> 01:03:29,630
Uh-oh, a chair.

814
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:37,500
Can I rip off the gas line and just throw a match in here?

815
01:03:38,219 --> 01:03:42,190
Nice.

816
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:44,110
Pick up.

817
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:48,139
No, I want the hat.

818
01:03:48,139 --> 01:03:48,780
I want the chair.

819
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:54,400
Hello?

820
01:03:55,469 --> 01:03:55,869
Hello?

821
01:03:56,510 --> 01:04:02,829
Oh, didn't even break the table.

822
01:04:03,469 --> 01:04:04,409
Come on, man.

823
01:04:11,559 --> 01:04:12,039
Let's go.

824
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:17,070
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

825
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:18,030
Ear grab.

826
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:18,750
That's not cool.

827
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:36,570
Oh, he's bigger than me.

828
01:04:37,130 --> 01:04:43,159
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

829
01:04:43,159 --> 01:04:43,719
Scripted.

830
01:04:43,719 --> 01:04:44,280
Scripted.

831
01:04:45,079 --> 01:04:45,559
Scripted.

832
01:04:46,199 --> 01:04:53,309
He blocked everything.

833
01:05:04,489 --> 01:05:15,579
Uh-oh, I'm in trouble.

834
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:21,230
All right, am I missing something from the tutorial five days ago?

835
01:05:22,429 --> 01:05:24,030
Wait, am I not doing something right here?

836
01:05:26,269 --> 01:05:27,789
I think you hold the block.

837
01:05:27,789 --> 01:05:28,909
You can dodge, too, can't you?

838
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:44,320
Counter attack.

839
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:48,639
So you hold square and then hit left or right right before he swings, right?

840
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:52,400
Remember, I did the first half of this tutorial five days ago.

841
01:05:53,679 --> 01:05:54,719
I haven't turned it on since.

842
01:05:55,360 --> 01:06:03,480
Just pressing the direction while holding the block.

843
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:08,489
Save the goatee?

844
01:06:08,489 --> 01:06:08,730
No.

845
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:18,909
I'm going to not shower for the rest of the game.

846
01:06:22,039 --> 01:06:23,400
Can I stay like this forever?

847
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,719
Can I just be the guy that got slimed the whole game?

848
01:06:49,929 --> 01:06:51,610
Come on, it seems.

849
01:06:51,610 --> 01:06:53,449
Tom, you found him.

850
01:06:53,449 --> 01:06:55,130
Yes, I have.

851
01:06:55,130 --> 01:06:58,010
He's being held by some bounty hunters,

852
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:01,769
trying to see how much money the government will pay them.

853
01:07:01,769 --> 01:07:05,530
I know he's in Blackwater, but there's talk of them moving.

854
01:07:06,409 --> 01:07:07,130
We'll get a second here.

855
01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:08,809
I'm going to update you guys on the green screen.

856
01:07:13,639 --> 01:07:14,599
We've been live for about an hour.

857
01:07:14,599 --> 01:07:16,039
There'll be breakertons all over the place.

858
01:07:16,039 --> 01:07:17,880
But if he's alive, we've got to try.

859
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:18,840
Updates on how that's going to happen.

860
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:19,400
Yeah, of course.

861
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:21,880
It's you they want, Dutch.

862
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:22,840
Always is.

863
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:26,360
Charles, go find out what you can.

864
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:27,239
Carefully.

865
01:07:27,239 --> 01:07:29,400
Josiah, take Javier.

866
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:32,199
Arthur, go get yourself cleaned up.

867
01:07:32,199 --> 01:07:33,480
Join them when you're ready.

868
01:07:34,039 --> 01:07:35,000
What about me?

869
01:07:36,829 --> 01:07:37,789
Well, exactly.

870
01:07:37,789 --> 01:07:38,670
What about you?

871
01:07:39,230 --> 01:07:40,190
What does that mean?

872
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:44,190
Oh no, never mind.

873
01:07:51,630 --> 01:07:53,949
Okay, so let's talk for a second.

874
01:07:55,150 --> 01:07:57,070
So if you missed the stream,

875
01:07:57,070 --> 01:07:58,909
let me just put the camera on because we're here.

876
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:02,349
If you missed the stream from three or four days ago or so,

877
01:08:03,469 --> 01:08:05,949
my plan was because we were having a bunch of internet problems,

878
01:08:05,949 --> 01:08:07,309
and we still are.

879
01:08:07,309 --> 01:08:08,590
It's not completely fixed yet.

880
01:08:09,309 --> 01:08:12,269
So wait, is this my my desync here?

881
01:08:13,150 --> 01:08:13,880
I might be.

882
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:27,470
Let me sync this up.

883
01:08:28,029 --> 01:08:38,220
All right.

884
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:41,800
Come on out here thing.

885
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:42,279
There we go.

886
01:08:43,159 --> 01:08:48,140
All right, so because the beard's growing,

887
01:08:50,489 --> 01:08:51,529
I haven't had time to shave.

888
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:55,479
That should be good now.

889
01:08:56,039 --> 01:08:58,840
But anyways, because of the internet problems,

890
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:01,000
my plan was if we didn't get it back,

891
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,439
I was going to desperately try to get the green screen stream done like tomorrow.

892
01:09:04,439 --> 01:09:08,439
But now that they're actually working on the infrastructural problems

893
01:09:08,439 --> 01:09:09,560
that were in this area,

894
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:13,319
I think I'll be able to stream now.

895
01:09:13,319 --> 01:09:16,039
I don't quote me on that, but like I did just say it.

896
01:09:17,159 --> 01:09:18,439
This has been green here for a while.

897
01:09:18,439 --> 01:09:19,239
No drop frames.

898
01:09:19,239 --> 01:09:20,520
It's looking all right for now.

899
01:09:21,479 --> 01:09:24,199
So the green screen stream,

900
01:09:24,199 --> 01:09:25,319
if you don't know what I'm talking about,

901
01:09:25,319 --> 01:09:27,479
I'm going to get in front of a green screen for like an hour or two.

902
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:31,560
And I'm going to do a bunch of actions that you guys ask for and that we vote on.

903
01:09:32,199 --> 01:09:33,960
But here's how I'm changing it though.

904
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,359
Because I'm including props,

905
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:40,380
you know, I'm only going to we're going to set it up probably in a couple of sections.

906
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:43,659
Like you'll be voting for props, you know, prop actions.

907
01:09:43,659 --> 01:09:48,939
You'll be voting for regular actions because every prop action will just win.

908
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:53,260
And I'll have to spend like five grand on like two day Amazon stuff.

909
01:09:53,899 --> 01:09:57,500
So we're definitely we're definitely going to have to split it off into different sections.

910
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:59,180
So you have to vote for your favorite one.

911
01:10:01,279 --> 01:10:02,319
This is such a good idea.

912
01:10:02,319 --> 01:10:03,439
It's going to be a lot of fun.

913
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:06,159
So we're not doing that like tomorrow

914
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:08,880
because I need some more time to go through and section these off.

915
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:12,800
And I'm going to present in the discord a series of polls.

916
01:10:13,359 --> 01:10:14,720
We're going to vote on them.

917
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:18,880
This is not I'm going to I'm going to try to get this done from tonight into tomorrow.

918
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:22,479
And I'd say by this weekend you'll have a poll to vote on.

919
01:10:22,479 --> 01:10:24,479
But with three different sections in it.

920
01:10:24,479 --> 01:10:30,079
And then I'll be streaming periodically hopefully if the internet stays fine.

921
01:10:31,039 --> 01:10:34,000
Expect now that the streams are able to happen from here.

922
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:37,600
We'll push this forward a little bit so people have time to participate.

923
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:42,079
And we'll get that stream probably going next week.

924
01:10:42,079 --> 01:10:44,079
Like probably like six or seven days from right now.

925
01:10:45,609 --> 01:10:48,729
I have a studio that I'm currently in contact with

926
01:10:48,729 --> 01:10:50,729
and working with so it is that it's happening.

927
01:10:50,729 --> 01:10:52,729
We just need some more time to get it prepared.

928
01:10:53,369 --> 01:10:55,340
Because I know I'm going to need to buy props.

929
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:57,340
And that's going to take at least two days to get that stuff here.

930
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:00,699
So now hopefully that's a decent update.

931
01:11:00,699 --> 01:11:02,539
It's no longer a secret anymore by the way.

932
01:11:02,539 --> 01:11:04,699
Because I need to know what props I have to get.

933
01:11:05,579 --> 01:11:07,979
So that this is the whole secret thing.

934
01:11:07,979 --> 01:11:10,939
Like I'm not going to know is that's not happening anymore.

935
01:11:10,939 --> 01:11:13,340
So I'll be in there browsing and perusing.

936
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:15,180
And JabbaDab just gave five more subs.

937
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,520
Five community subs from JabbaDab.

938
01:11:18,079 --> 01:11:20,810
Thank you.

939
01:11:20,890 --> 01:11:22,409
Can't you just paint one of your rooms green?

940
01:11:22,409 --> 01:11:23,449
Oh I mean well I could.

941
01:11:24,010 --> 01:11:25,449
But you have to remember something.

942
01:11:25,449 --> 01:11:28,250
A green screen studio is like 50 feet up and down.

943
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:32,890
If I were to paint a room back here it would just be like by...

944
01:11:33,529 --> 01:11:38,010
It would be impossible to do let's say me sprinting and sliding into home base.

945
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:39,289
I wouldn't be able to do that.

946
01:11:40,090 --> 01:11:45,050
With an actual studio I'll be able to do large scale movements.

947
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:46,970
Full body, feet, everything.

948
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:47,770
It will be keyed out.

949
01:11:49,159 --> 01:11:49,800
And thank...

950
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,199
Kazzy101 just gave five community subs here.

951
01:11:52,199 --> 01:11:52,520
Thank you.

952
01:11:54,859 --> 01:11:55,739
Here's another one.

953
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:58,920
Thank you so much guys.

954
01:11:58,920 --> 01:11:59,560
Both of you.

955
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:00,279
Five in a row here.

956
01:12:00,279 --> 01:12:00,840
Five in a row.

957
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:05,210
Yeah so like you'll be able to see full body,

958
01:12:05,210 --> 01:12:08,090
complete green over like a 40 or 50 foot space.

959
01:12:08,970 --> 01:12:10,489
It professionally lit.

960
01:12:10,489 --> 01:12:11,770
It'll be perfect.

961
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:15,319
Because you either go hard or go home with this.

962
01:12:15,319 --> 01:12:15,880
You know what I'm saying?

963
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:18,600
Like I don't want to put like just a green screen behind me and like

964
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:19,880
do five Fortnite dances.

965
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:20,920
No, no, no, no, no, no.

966
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,359
Like there's gonna be a lot of shit that I'm gonna do in front of this camera.

967
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:29,279
But regardless that's kind of the update with that situation.

968
01:12:29,279 --> 01:12:30,640
We're gonna do that probably next week.

969
01:12:31,359 --> 01:12:33,680
Give some more time to get more suggestions

970
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:34,960
and for me to make some polls

971
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:38,399
and you will hear about it again over the coming couple of days.

972
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:39,279
Here we go.

973
01:12:39,279 --> 01:12:43,529
Okay back to John Marston or no Arthur.

974
01:12:44,409 --> 01:12:46,010
All right multiple missions are available in the camp.

975
01:12:46,010 --> 01:12:47,930
These are shown as the that thing.

976
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:50,800
All right I need to take...

977
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:51,680
Maybe I should take a bath.

978
01:12:52,399 --> 01:12:56,840
Can we have a peek at the recommendations?

979
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:58,039
You can go look at it right now.

980
01:12:58,039 --> 01:12:58,840
You got your act together.

981
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:02,039
There's a channel in the discord that is...

982
01:13:03,079 --> 01:13:03,960
I don't have anything in my...

983
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,640
Okay well just please can I...

984
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:06,920
I don't want to aim weapon.

985
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:08,439
Browse catalog.

986
01:13:08,439 --> 01:13:09,960
No more nonsense from you.

987
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:11,399
Here's the catalog.

988
01:13:11,399 --> 01:13:13,720
There's a green screen discord channel.

989
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:17,239
Okay ammunition, hunting and fishing, horse care, clothing.

990
01:13:17,239 --> 01:13:17,720
Here we go.

Clothing department outfits.

992
01:13:21,399 --> 01:13:22,359
Let's take a look at the outfits.

993
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:28,199
No 85 bucks.

994
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,560
The valentine 113.

995
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:34,119
It's locked.

996
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:37,149
Custom tailored apparel of distinction.

997
01:13:37,149 --> 01:13:37,949
That one's not bad.

998
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:41,640
The dewberry creek.

999
01:13:42,439 --> 01:13:44,199
I ain't gonna stay patient forever.

1000
01:13:44,199 --> 01:13:45,079
Get down to business.

1001
01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:48,430

Mosea blackwater possum skin hat.

1010
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:11,770
Did I get the rat hat?

1011
01:14:12,409 --> 01:14:14,520
I got things to tend to so get on with it.

1012
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,279
With items from our sewing department.

1013
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:18,649
Can I not select it?

1014
01:14:28,859 --> 01:14:30,460
You need to bring the rat.

1015
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:34,890
Oh I need to go kill rats?

1016
01:14:35,689 --> 01:14:38,680
All right I need one that's gonna be cool.

1017
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:39,640

Durable friends.

1026
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:06,079
These are bargains.

1027
01:15:06,079 --> 01:15:09,119
But please go ahead and turn the page in an inconceivable act of cowl.

1028
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,199
Well now I have to buy it because...

1029
01:15:18,909 --> 01:15:19,630
Should I be like...

1030
01:15:19,630 --> 01:15:20,189
Get on with it.

1031
01:15:20,189 --> 01:15:21,630

01:15:22,430 --> 01:15:26,729
All right I'm gonna be a candy cane.

1033
01:15:27,369 --> 01:15:28,170
The Halloween's over.

1034
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:28,970
It's time for Christmas.

1035
01:15:34,989 --> 01:15:35,630
Okay.

1036
01:15:35,630 --> 01:15:40,060
Which one are the cheapest ones?

1037
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:41,100
Well these ones are 16.

1038
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:47,680
We're going with the dog shit ones down here.

1039
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:48,960
Worn...

1040
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:50,159
Well actually riding boots.

1041

Is that it?

1103
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,279

Maybe I don't have a shirt.

1112
01:20:15,279 --> 01:20:16,399
Maybe just no shirt?

1113
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:19,260
I ain't gonna stay patient forever.

1114
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:19,739
Get down to business.

1115
01:20:19,739 --> 01:20:20,539

1128
01:20:57,340 --> 01:21:14,810
I mean it's not really a holiday.

1129
01:21:16,859 --> 01:21:17,420
It's more.

1130
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:23,930

1131
01:21:24,649 --> 01:21:25,210

01:22:00,939 --> 01:22:02,699
I ain't gonna stay patient forever.

1140
01:22:02,699 --> 01:22:03,579
Get down to business.

1141
01:22:05,390 --> 01:22:07,630
You look like the cowboy joker.

1142
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:12,840
All right so we got spurs too right.

1143
01:22:15,949 --> 01:22:17,789

01:22:22,430 --> 01:22:24,590
Shank and point ten point Rowells.

1147
01:22:25,310 --> 01:22:30,479
I don't like those.

1148
01:22:30,479 --> 01:22:35,260
That's not bad.

1149
01:22:35,899 --> 01:22:39,149
I got things to tend to so get on with it.

1150
01:22:42,939 --> 01:22:43,659
Those ones are big.

1151
01:22:46,510 --> 01:22:48,430
These have jingle bells on them though.

1152
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:49,149
That's important.

1153
01:22:49,789 --> 01:22:52,090
Let's try these ones first.

1154
01:22:53,770 --> 01:22:54,569
No that's not bad.

1155
01:22:55,130 --> 01:22:59,800
Are there any others besides those ones?

1156
01:23:00,829 --> 01:23:01,789
These are close.

1157
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:04,319
Those are good.

1158
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:09,399
I ain't gonna stay patient forever.

1159
01:23:09,399 --> 01:23:09,640
Okay.

1160
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:10,520
Get down to business.

1161
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:12,840
All right I've spent like half the money that I own.

1162
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:13,479
So that's it.

1163
01:23:19,710 --> 01:23:21,789
All right my outfit is now done for the rest of the game.

1164
01:23:29,479 --> 01:23:31,479
Okay well I've got something to tell you.

1165
01:23:31,479 --> 01:23:34,039
From behind here we just look like a grandma.

1166
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:37,609
Especially with like the side purse.

1167

Yeah look.

1168
01:23:40,619 --> 01:23:43,470
Oh Jesus would you look at that.

1169
01:23:43,470 --> 01:23:45,789
There's a sale on flowers over here.

1170
01:23:46,670 --> 01:23:48,109
Oh my aching back.

1171
01:23:52,079 --> 01:23:53,279
It's time to go to church.

1172
01:23:54,079 --> 01:24:04,239
Just wait this is this is not my horse.

1173
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:05,439
Oh shit.

1174
01:24:05,439 --> 01:24:05,760
Is it?

1175
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:07,279
Is this my horse?

1176
01:24:10,350 --> 01:24:11,149
It's not my horse.

1177
01:24:11,949 --> 01:24:12,750
Fuck.

1178
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:26,060
Where's my horse?

1179
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:27,869
He's coming.

1180
01:24:27,869 --> 01:24:35,770
Come here come here come here come here come here come here.

1181
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:37,500
All right let's make it out.

1182
01:24:39,689 --> 01:24:41,449
You were wanted lawmen and now searching for you.

1183
01:24:41,449 --> 01:24:42,810
They ain't gonna find me.

1184
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:44,569
Because I'm almost out of the GTA circle.

1185
01:24:45,289 --> 01:24:46,350
All right we're good.

1186
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:49,760
Evade the law by escaping from the red search area.

1187
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:50,640
Which is what I did.

1188
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:51,279
Oh not yet.

1189
01:24:51,279 --> 01:24:52,560
Hold on not yet not yet not yet.

1190
01:24:53,359 --> 01:24:54,079
What am I stuck on?

1191
01:24:57,720 --> 01:24:58,039
Yep.

1192
01:25:00,319 --> 01:25:01,520
I'm out of the circle now right.

1193
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,199
Don't no no no no no.

1194
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:03,760
Stay right here.

1195
01:25:12,590 --> 01:25:14,109
All right I don't know if that's fair.

1196
01:25:15,439 --> 01:25:18,640
If I just sat on the horse and I didn't realize what I was doing.

1197
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:20,720
And I got off the horse.

1198
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:23,520
Doesn't that me admitting that oh I didn't sorry I didn't mean to do that.

1199
01:25:30,170 --> 01:25:34,890
That's like walking out of a store with an item that you didn't know was still in the cart.

1200
01:25:34,890 --> 01:25:36,489
And you turn around and bring it back and go.

1201
01:25:36,489 --> 01:25:38,010
I didn't know this is the bottom of my cart.

1202
01:25:39,130 --> 01:25:39,930
How's that any different?

1203
01:25:47,739 --> 01:25:49,979
That's a fine horse you got there.

1204
01:25:49,979 --> 01:25:50,699
Appreciate it.

1205
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:54,680
All right be well now.

1206
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:55,560
See you.

1207
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:57,949
Hey mister can I have a word?

1208
01:25:57,949 --> 01:26:02,649
Easy there.

1209
01:26:02,649 --> 01:26:04,649
Give me your money now tough guy.

1210
01:26:05,369 --> 01:26:06,810
You're a dead man.

1211
01:26:06,810 --> 01:26:08,729
You're gonna give me a call to use this?

1212
01:26:08,729 --> 01:26:10,729
Don't think I won't shoot you.

1213
01:26:11,369 --> 01:26:12,170
I'll close you.

1214
01:26:14,170 --> 01:26:15,689
Fuck was he gonna give it to me.

1215
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:19,800
Oh it says a witness.

1216
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:32,010
Oh god what do you have for me.

1217
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:33,130
He moved too much.

1218
01:26:33,130 --> 01:26:34,489
You can't have a fuck with a snake man.

1219
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:37,840
No sudden movements.

1220
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:38,880
He reached like he went.

1221
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,159
What is that thing?

1222
01:26:45,720 --> 01:27:08,479
I can't I can't study it.

1223
01:27:09,420 --> 01:27:26,239
Oh okay can I take them?

1224
01:27:26,239 --> 01:27:27,279
Give me this one too.

1225
01:27:27,279 --> 01:27:29,039
Wait wait no R1 R1 R1.

1226
01:27:31,930 --> 01:27:32,890
Squirrel what?

1227
01:27:37,789 --> 01:27:39,229
Why does it keep saying squirrel?

1228
01:27:39,229 --> 01:27:40,189
Is there a squirrel here?

1229
01:27:45,689 --> 01:27:46,569
Where's the squirrel?

1230
01:27:47,130 --> 01:27:57,180
Did I run a squirrel over?

1231
01:27:57,180 --> 01:28:14,159
Oh well let's go back to the what we were actually doing.

1232
01:28:16,039 --> 01:28:23,180
Yeah slow down slow.

1233
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:26,520
What is this?

1234
01:28:27,159 --> 01:28:33,949
Hey mister.

1235
01:28:37,689 --> 01:28:39,689
Uh he's like I'm not gonna fuck around.

1236
01:28:39,689 --> 01:28:40,729
No just like let me go.

1237
01:28:41,369 --> 01:28:42,489
I'm not gonna rob this guy.

1238
01:28:43,210 --> 01:28:46,039
Let's go to the mission.

1239
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:52,829
I need to get back on a path.

1240
01:28:53,470 --> 01:29:00,560
The one guy this is this red.

1241
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:02,000
Is this like an area where they're gonna find me?

1242
01:29:05,079 --> 01:29:32,250
Oh oh oh where uh where the where the hell is it?

1243
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:35,930
Where did it go?

1244
01:29:36,729 --> 01:29:38,859
Let's go boy.

1245
01:29:38,859 --> 01:29:39,500
It ran?

1246
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:41,260
I ran I I ran him over.

1247
01:29:43,770 --> 01:29:45,930
Well stop getting distracted.

1248
01:29:54,220 --> 01:29:56,300
Uh oh uh oh there come the hyenas.

1249
01:29:57,500 --> 01:30:02,189
I'm gonna go back to camp.

1250
01:30:02,189 --> 01:30:03,069
Let's get this meat here.

1251
01:30:15,159 --> 01:30:16,600
No thank you for stopping me.

1252
01:30:17,239 --> 01:30:29,479
Down here.

1253
01:30:32,170 --> 01:30:33,289
No you can't get down that.

1254
01:30:34,619 --> 01:30:35,260
No he can't.

1255
01:30:35,899 --> 01:30:36,699
Pitch the horse.

1256
01:30:38,170 --> 01:30:40,170
Don't kick me backwards please.

1257
01:30:40,170 --> 01:30:40,729
You're fine.

1258
01:30:41,449 --> 01:30:42,090
I'm gonna pet him.

1259
01:30:42,810 --> 01:30:44,380
He's fine.

1260
01:30:48,170 --> 01:30:49,609
There's the path I want to go.

1261
01:30:49,770 --> 01:30:50,170
Right here.

1262
01:31:05,449 --> 01:31:06,010
He's all right.

1263
01:31:11,789 --> 01:31:13,550
I didn't know that was gonna be that far drop.

1264
01:31:19,529 --> 01:31:20,890
Special horse reviver.

1265
01:31:22,439 --> 01:31:23,159
Okay let's go.

1266
01:31:28,279 --> 01:31:29,560
I'm gonna just trot for a second.

1267
01:31:30,359 --> 01:31:36,079
Although can I kind of make like a waypoint?

1268
01:31:36,079 --> 01:31:37,680
Do those do those exist?

1269
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:38,720
I'm so far away.

1270
01:31:42,460 --> 01:31:44,140
I'm all the way down here.

1271
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:45,260
Holy shit.

1272
01:31:45,260 --> 01:31:46,779
What the hell was I doing all the way up there?

1273
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:01,880
Out of options eat the horse.

1274
01:32:03,899 --> 01:32:04,539
Fast travel?

1275
01:32:04,779 --> 01:32:05,899
Should I fast travel or should I run?

1276
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:09,739
Feed the horse?

1277
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:14,399
Christ.

1278
01:32:14,399 --> 01:32:15,840
All right what does horse break?

1279
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:20,430
Is it like square?

1280
01:32:20,430 --> 01:32:21,630
Like how do you slow down?

1281
01:32:23,279 --> 01:32:23,840
Arb one.

1282
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:24,340
Okay.

1283
01:32:27,130 --> 01:32:28,409
I think those are bad guys by the way.

1284
01:32:28,409 --> 01:32:29,689
Horses dirty and causes health.

1285
01:32:29,689 --> 01:32:31,130
You gotta brush your horse or ride it through water.

1286
01:32:31,130 --> 01:32:34,479
Here we go.

1287
01:32:34,479 --> 01:32:35,119
Helpful all right.

1288
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:36,960
I'm gonna brush him.

1289
01:32:39,359 --> 01:32:42,810
Sorry pet him.

1290
01:32:43,369 --> 01:32:44,729
He's nicely clean.

1291
01:32:48,060 --> 01:32:49,180
Robbery in progress.

1292
01:32:49,899 --> 01:32:59,210
Is a bleeding animal on its back?

1293
01:33:00,090 --> 01:33:00,939
Oh fuck.

1294
01:33:19,609 --> 01:33:20,250
What the fuck?

1295
01:33:25,260 --> 01:33:28,569
All right now how do I?

1296
01:33:28,569 --> 01:33:29,770
Can I like take everything?

1297
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:38,220
Satchel's full.

1298
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:43,880
Kind of wedding ring.

1299
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:51,159
Hold on.

1300
01:33:51,159 --> 01:33:53,039
Two chewing tobacco.

1301
01:33:53,039 --> 01:33:53,680
Does this guy have a gun?

1302
01:34:01,260 --> 01:34:02,939
Maintain guys.

1303
01:34:02,939 --> 01:34:03,420
Hold on.

1304
01:34:03,420 --> 01:34:03,819
Pick up.

1305
01:34:05,020 --> 01:34:05,979
Carbine repeater.

1306
01:34:06,699 --> 01:34:10,670
Open eyes provide half the benefits of new items.

1307
01:34:11,470 --> 01:34:15,020
Should I just leave these guys here?

1308
01:34:15,180 --> 01:34:17,770
Can I go in the back of this?

1309
01:34:22,890 --> 01:34:37,680
And I just take seven repeater cartridges.

1310
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:39,520
Revolver cartridges.

1311
01:34:43,069 --> 01:34:43,789
Baked beans.

1312
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:46,779
Is that it?

1313
01:34:49,210 --> 01:34:50,010
Why am I doing this?

1314
01:34:52,590 --> 01:34:54,890
Why can't I just go in like a normal person?

1315
01:34:55,529 --> 01:34:57,199
Just go in.

1316
01:34:57,199 --> 01:34:58,880
Why do you have the Spider-Man around this?

1317
01:34:58,880 --> 01:34:59,680
Just go in.

1318
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:03,520
What is the ground poison?

1319
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:04,399
I don't understand.

1320
01:35:04,399 --> 01:35:04,960
Get in there.

1321
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:06,880
All right this is mine now.

1322
01:35:16,430 --> 01:35:32,119
Santa got his sleigh.

1323
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:37,359
I can, can I sell this?

1324
01:35:37,359 --> 01:35:38,640
What the hell is going on here?

1325
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:39,279
What happened?

1326
01:35:39,279 --> 01:35:42,079
I'm just getting attacked by a random...

1327
01:35:42,079 --> 01:35:45,399
Come on horse, let's go.

1328
01:35:45,399 --> 01:35:46,199
Is he coming?

1329
01:35:46,199 --> 01:35:54,460
He's going?

1330
01:35:54,460 --> 01:36:04,670
Wait, okay, I thought that was a guy running.

1331
01:36:04,670 --> 01:36:07,310
I need to eat something.

1332
01:36:07,310 --> 01:36:08,430
What do we got?

1333
01:36:08,430 --> 01:36:13,130
Dead Eye Tonic Baked Beans.

1334
01:36:14,479 --> 01:36:15,760
Can I throw it to the horses?

1335
01:36:18,859 --> 01:36:19,899
Turn off the fan?

1336
01:36:19,899 --> 01:36:27,520
What the, the PlayStation 4 fan?

1337
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:29,520
That's impossible.

1338
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:32,600
That's the thing.

1339
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:33,399
That's impossible.

1340
01:36:36,159 --> 01:36:42,430
That's the PS4 just churning right now.

1341
01:36:42,430 --> 01:36:44,270
I gotta turn off the PS4 fan.

1342
01:36:49,770 --> 01:36:51,210
Just turn off the PS4.

1343
01:36:51,210 --> 01:36:51,930
What are you waiting for?

1344
01:37:05,930 --> 01:37:06,409
Who's this?

1345
01:37:07,050 --> 01:37:09,180
I mean, who's there?

1346
01:37:11,930 --> 01:37:12,409
What are you doing?

1347
01:37:12,409 --> 01:37:12,970
What's happening?

1348
01:37:15,199 --> 01:37:15,760
I'm here.

1349
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:16,260
What?

1350
01:37:20,479 --> 01:37:21,760
Everything wagons to the camp.

1351
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:23,199
They'll be available again when you leave.

1352
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,670
Oh, well, I can't bring that in here.

1353
01:37:29,609 --> 01:37:31,930
I still got my, my fox corpus.

1354
01:37:32,649 --> 01:37:41,130
Where, hey, can I talk to him?

1355
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:50,920
Camp funds, 30 bucks.

1356
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:52,279
Yeah, you left me to deal with the big guy.

1357
01:37:55,079 --> 01:37:59,199
Drive the wagon off.

1358
01:37:59,199 --> 01:38:01,359
Don't give me ideas like that, man.

1359
01:38:01,359 --> 01:38:03,840
I will derail this whole stream for an hour and a half.

1360
01:38:11,899 --> 01:38:12,859
And I'm dirty, too.

1361
01:38:12,859 --> 01:38:14,779
I got my new Santa suit dirty.

1362
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:22,430
I can't even get on it.

1363
01:38:26,510 --> 01:38:29,760
They won't let me get on anymore.

1364
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:30,800
They took it away from me.

1365
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:45,500
Red's not a Christmas color.

1366
01:38:46,890 --> 01:38:47,689
What?

1367
01:38:48,409 --> 01:38:49,449
Santa is red.

1368
01:38:50,409 --> 01:38:50,909
What?

1369
01:38:51,770 --> 01:38:53,130
He's a big red guy.

1370
01:38:58,890 --> 01:39:00,090
I've read that wrong.

1371
01:39:00,090 --> 01:39:00,590
I did?

1372
01:39:01,609 --> 01:39:07,289
Bring him animal supplies to the camp.

1373
01:39:07,289 --> 01:39:09,449
We can use the meat for food and skins to craft satchels.

1374
01:39:09,449 --> 01:39:10,010
All right.

1375
01:39:10,010 --> 01:39:10,970
Let me, hold on a second.

1376
01:39:11,609 --> 01:39:13,850
Let's go to the butcher.

1377
01:39:13,850 --> 01:39:15,850
I want to, where's my, okay, I got my wolf, right?

1378
01:39:15,850 --> 01:39:16,970
He's still stowed.

1379
01:39:16,970 --> 01:39:18,090
So then he should show up, right?

1380
01:39:18,970 --> 01:39:24,409
I'm going to actually give some real money here.

1381
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:29,560
I'm going to donate some money.

1382
01:39:34,119 --> 01:39:36,199
They said it is a, okay, give item.

1383
01:39:37,720 --> 01:39:38,760
Ooh, watches.

1384
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:40,279
No, well, these are worth a lot of money.

1385
01:39:43,100 --> 01:39:43,420
All right.

1386
01:39:43,420 --> 01:39:44,939
I'll give one clamp.

1387
01:39:45,579 --> 01:39:46,220
Buckle.

1388
01:39:46,220 --> 01:39:51,130
All right.

1389
01:39:51,130 --> 01:39:52,010
That's fine.

1390
01:39:52,010 --> 01:39:54,890
Well, they only, I have more money than the whole camp combined.

1391
01:39:54,890 --> 01:39:56,329
That's not, that's not okay.

1392
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:01,079
All right.

1393
01:40:01,079 --> 01:40:01,880
I'm going to give some money.

1394
01:40:02,680 --> 01:40:04,680
What do I get?

1395
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:05,399
88 bucks.

1396
01:40:08,750 --> 01:40:09,550
I'm going to give $10.

1397
01:40:10,510 --> 01:40:11,949
No, I'll get $15.

1398
01:40:15,279 --> 01:40:15,779
$16.

1399
01:40:17,199 --> 01:40:18,159
That's got to be worth something.

1400
01:40:23,819 --> 01:40:24,460
Go to the butcher.

1401
01:40:27,869 --> 01:40:29,229
Thank you for the 1600.

1402
01:40:29,229 --> 01:40:29,550
All right.

1403
01:40:29,550 --> 01:40:30,050
Donate.

1404
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,239
We could really use some more meat, Mr. Morgan.

1405
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:35,060
Okay.

1406
01:40:35,439 --> 01:40:37,399
Provisions, the coyote meat.

1407
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:40,060
Let me see.

1408
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:45,130
Coyote pelt and some meat.

1409
01:40:45,130 --> 01:40:46,729
Well, I'll take what I can get.

1410
01:40:46,729 --> 01:40:47,229
Okay.

1411
01:40:48,119 --> 01:40:49,399
Many thanks, Mr. Morgan.

1412
01:40:49,399 --> 01:40:50,119
So let me see.

1413
01:40:50,119 --> 01:40:51,720
What do I need to do to upgrade my satchel?

1414
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:52,439
My satchel sucks.

1415
01:40:52,439 --> 01:40:54,680
I'm more than happy to craft you something if you bring me the right materials.

1416
01:40:55,239 --> 01:40:55,720
Okay.

1417
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:59,079
I need to purchase leather working tools and upgrade the medicine wagon.

1418
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:02,810
So I need leather working tools.

1419
01:41:03,609 --> 01:41:06,170
And then donate five animal carcasses to Pearson.

1420
01:41:12,270 --> 01:41:13,789
So I need to buy leather working tools.

1421
01:41:14,510 --> 01:41:17,020
Where the hell do I get those?

1422
01:41:17,020 --> 01:41:20,699
I reckon I'm going to think about it.

1423
01:41:20,699 --> 01:41:22,720
Where am I supposed to get that shit?

1424
01:41:26,479 --> 01:41:26,979
All right.

1425
01:41:28,170 --> 01:41:29,130
I can eat from the soup, right?

1426
01:41:29,130 --> 01:41:30,329
Because I get one soup a day.

1427
01:41:31,050 --> 01:41:35,609
All good.

1428
01:41:35,609 --> 01:41:39,210
But what if, well, what if I want an extra serving?

1429
01:41:42,170 --> 01:41:42,810
It's not allowed.

1430
01:41:42,810 --> 01:41:43,050
Okay.

1431
01:41:43,050 --> 01:41:44,489
Well, we've got a mission right here.

1432
01:41:44,489 --> 01:41:45,770
This guy's like tied to a tree.

1433
01:41:45,770 --> 01:41:46,489
Let's see what his problem is.

1434
01:41:46,489 --> 01:41:47,449
What's this going to end?

1435
01:41:52,970 --> 01:41:53,470
Speak.

1436
01:41:54,010 --> 01:41:55,600
Don't cry, boy.

1437
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:57,359
Speak about your gang.

1438
01:42:01,689 --> 01:42:05,609
I can't.

1439
01:42:05,609 --> 01:42:07,130
I have to beat this guy up tied to a tree.

1440
01:42:07,130 --> 01:42:07,850
Boy.

1441
01:42:07,850 --> 01:42:08,569
Whoa.

1442
01:42:08,569 --> 01:42:09,800
Horses there.

1443
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:10,300
Whoa.

1444
01:42:10,300 --> 01:42:13,800
It seems the cat has got our friend here's tongue.

1445
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:16,199
I was thinking Mr. Williamson could have a word.

1446
01:42:16,199 --> 01:42:17,560
Be ready to talk, boy.

1447
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:18,520
I told you, mister.

1448
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:19,479
I told all of you.

1449
01:42:19,479 --> 01:42:21,000
H1 and his chief.

1450
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,600
They ain't no friends of mine.

1451
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:24,279
I've just been ridding with them for a while.

1452
01:42:24,279 --> 01:42:25,079
Horseshit.

1453
01:42:25,079 --> 01:42:26,600
You see, we heard that part.

1454
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:28,439
So how about you tell the truth?

1455
01:42:28,439 --> 01:42:29,720
That's what you want me to do.

1456
01:42:29,720 --> 01:42:30,439
Heard him.

1457
01:42:30,439 --> 01:42:32,439
So the next time he opens his mouth,

1458
01:42:32,439 --> 01:42:34,359
it is to tell us what is going on.

1459
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:36,439
Who am I kidding?

1460
01:42:37,079 --> 01:42:39,560
One old Driscoll's boys couldn't open his mouth,

1461
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:40,680
but he'd tell a lie.

1462
01:42:42,090 --> 01:42:43,210
Screw it.

1463
01:42:43,210 --> 01:42:45,449
Let's just have some fun.

1464
01:42:45,449 --> 01:42:47,289
Well, why don't you carve out his brain?

1465
01:42:48,090 --> 01:42:48,810
Eat his brain.

1466
01:42:48,810 --> 01:42:49,449
What's he doing?

1467
01:42:49,449 --> 01:42:49,770
Where's he going?

1468
01:42:49,770 --> 01:42:51,210
And then close your eyes and sleep

1469
01:42:51,210 --> 01:42:52,409
and see if while you're digesting it,

1470
01:42:52,409 --> 01:42:53,289
you can hear his thoughts.

1471
01:42:55,050 --> 01:42:56,409
It's not a bad idea, I don't think.

1472
01:42:57,130 --> 01:43:00,859
You know, an imperial mix was among the happiest

1473
01:43:00,859 --> 01:43:02,539
and most loyal of courtiers.

1474
01:43:02,539 --> 01:43:03,739
Are you kidding me, right?

1475
01:43:03,739 --> 01:43:04,380
Of course.

1476
01:43:04,380 --> 01:43:05,579
You sick bastards!

1477
01:43:06,939 --> 01:43:07,979
What are we doing here?

1478
01:43:07,979 --> 01:43:09,739
Well, you are going to talk.

1479
01:43:09,739 --> 01:43:12,699
The only question is now or later

1480
01:43:12,699 --> 01:43:14,619
we got these little fellas off.

1481
01:43:14,619 --> 01:43:16,619
OK, listen.

1482
01:43:16,619 --> 01:43:18,859
I know where old Driscoll was holed up.

1483
01:43:18,859 --> 01:43:19,420
And you're right.

1484
01:43:20,060 --> 01:43:23,020
He don't like you any more than you like him.

1485
01:43:23,020 --> 01:43:24,699
He's at Six Point Cabin.

1486
01:43:25,500 --> 01:43:27,199
I'll take you there.

1487
01:43:27,199 --> 01:43:28,079
Serious.

1488
01:43:28,079 --> 01:43:29,439
I don't like him.

1489
01:43:29,439 --> 01:43:31,520
I mean, I like him even less than I like you.

1490
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:33,840
None taken.

1491
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:34,880
OK, then, partner.

1492
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:37,680
Why don't you take a few of us up there?

1493
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:40,600
I got this, Dutch.

1494
01:43:41,239 --> 01:43:42,199
Should be fun.

1495
01:43:42,199 --> 01:43:43,720
I was going for Santa and I ended up

1496
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:45,000
as like Willy Wonka.

1497
01:43:46,699 --> 01:43:47,199
Somehow.

1498
01:43:57,039 --> 01:43:57,600
What did I get?

1499
01:44:00,430 --> 01:44:01,710
Wild West Wonka.

1500
01:44:02,430 --> 01:44:03,310
All right, throwing knife.

1501
01:44:03,310 --> 01:44:04,590
A small knife with a straight blade

1502
01:44:04,590 --> 01:44:05,229
designed in balance

1503
01:44:05,229 --> 01:44:06,350
so they can be thrown with ease

1504
01:44:06,350 --> 01:44:07,390
can be used to silently take down

1505
01:44:07,390 --> 01:44:08,590
any of the range

1506
01:44:08,590 --> 01:44:10,189
or use as a melee weapon if required.

1507
01:44:10,189 --> 01:44:11,390
It can be purchased from some less

1508
01:44:11,390 --> 01:44:12,909
than reputable sellers to save a trip

1509
01:44:13,630 --> 01:44:15,550
by recollecting the knife after throwing.

1510
01:44:21,579 --> 01:44:24,479
OK, come here.

1511
01:44:24,479 --> 01:44:26,909
We got a social call needs making.

1512
01:44:27,710 --> 01:44:28,750
Where are we heading?

1513
01:44:28,750 --> 01:44:30,960
I'm sitting down for Santa and underwear.

1514
01:44:32,399 --> 01:44:33,199
What are you talking about?

1515
01:44:34,079 --> 01:44:35,439
John, you take this little rascal.

1516
01:44:35,439 --> 01:44:36,640
I mean, like, what are you talking about?

1517
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:38,319
Any nonsense, kill him.

1518
01:44:40,159 --> 01:44:40,960
Mount your horse.

1519
01:44:44,649 --> 01:44:45,210
OK, horse.

1520
01:44:45,930 --> 01:44:46,810
Let me pet you first.

1521
01:44:48,170 --> 01:44:58,039
Good boy.

1522
01:44:58,039 --> 01:44:59,479
OK, let's back it up.

1523
01:44:59,479 --> 01:45:05,399
I'm breaking things already.

1524
01:45:06,439 --> 01:45:08,039
I don't understand.

1525
01:45:08,039 --> 01:45:10,600
I just tried to move out of the fucking way.

1526
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:14,810
All right, let me get.

1527
01:45:15,369 --> 01:45:16,970
How many knives do I have?

1528
01:45:16,970 --> 01:45:17,470
Just one.

1529
01:45:21,020 --> 01:45:22,270
Beat that up.

1530
01:45:42,140 --> 01:45:47,659
Telling you about Willy Wonka.

1531
01:45:47,659 --> 01:45:50,539
He's our man somewhere.

1532
01:45:50,539 --> 01:45:51,979
Hoping the opportunity comes

1533
01:45:51,979 --> 01:45:54,619
up to mention it last goddamn thing.

1534
01:45:54,619 --> 01:45:55,739
We was fucking terrible.

1535
01:45:56,220 --> 01:46:01,039
Hey, if I got my rings, it's over here.

1536
01:46:02,729 --> 01:46:05,789
Yeah, country.

1537
01:46:05,789 --> 01:46:07,630
Take this track up through the rocks.

1538
01:46:10,439 --> 01:46:10,840
No, no, no.

1539
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:12,199
The Gene Wilder.

1540
01:46:12,199 --> 01:46:13,319
Willy Wonka was good.

1541
01:46:13,319 --> 01:46:21,930
But Johnny, they're talking like this.

1542
01:46:21,930 --> 01:46:23,609
The whole movie was kind of like, I don't know why.

1543
01:46:25,289 --> 01:46:26,970
I think the chewing gum is disgusting.

1544
01:46:26,970 --> 01:46:30,159
And I guess you're good here.

1545
01:46:30,159 --> 01:46:33,289
Unless some soft-handed feller comes along

1546
01:46:33,289 --> 01:46:35,210
and tells you you've gone too far.

1547
01:46:36,010 --> 01:46:37,289
What are you talking about?

1548
01:46:39,050 --> 01:46:40,010
Watch that whole movie.

1549
01:46:40,010 --> 01:46:43,770
It's just that you think beating the man to death

1550
01:46:47,199 --> 01:46:49,520
when we supposed to be laying low.

1551
01:46:49,770 --> 01:46:51,449
I saw your eyes, Morgan.

1552
01:46:52,329 --> 01:46:53,609
You didn't go clever.

1553
01:46:53,609 --> 01:46:54,649
You went soft.

1554
01:47:02,090 --> 01:47:03,050
That's how you talk.

1555
01:47:03,770 --> 01:47:04,170
Excuse me.

1556
01:47:04,170 --> 01:47:05,449
This is how I'm talking right now.

1557
01:47:06,970 --> 01:47:07,850
Do you hear this?

1558
01:47:10,399 --> 01:47:11,199
Does this sound?

1559
01:47:13,180 --> 01:47:14,939
Do you think I sound like that?

1560
01:47:14,939 --> 01:47:16,060
You're listening to me right now?

1561
01:47:20,329 --> 01:47:20,829
Yes.

1562
01:47:23,850 --> 01:47:24,890
That's what you hear.

1563
01:47:25,609 --> 01:47:32,189
You sound just like Johnny Depp.

1564
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:37,180
All right.

1565
01:47:37,180 --> 01:47:37,739
Speed it up.

1566
01:47:38,380 --> 01:47:41,239
This guy moves a muscle.

1567
01:47:42,119 --> 01:47:42,520
Brain.

1568
01:47:45,479 --> 01:47:46,039
You know what I mean?

1569
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:50,920
Hot knife through butter, through brain.

1570
01:48:03,149 --> 01:48:08,060
Maybe I know more about you than you know about them.

1571
01:48:08,060 --> 01:48:09,819
So tell us then.

1572
01:48:12,640 --> 01:48:13,520
Brain through butter.

1573
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:14,560
You're outlawed like them.

1574
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:25,869
About to survive like you live rough fighting the law.

1575
01:48:25,869 --> 01:48:27,630
I'm trying to fuck this up.

1576
01:48:27,630 --> 01:48:28,350
Get back up there.

1577
01:48:37,039 --> 01:48:38,720
You're already too close, man.

1578
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:40,560
Dutch is more like a teacher.

1579
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:44,000
From where I've been, you just look the same as all.

1580
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,760
Then you looked, but you ain't seen.

1581
01:48:47,739 --> 01:48:49,180
Shut that boy up.

1582
01:48:49,180 --> 01:48:49,819
There we go.

1583
01:48:49,819 --> 01:48:50,300
Shut him up.

1584
01:48:51,020 --> 01:48:53,180
Does it like road rash, this guy?

1585
01:48:53,180 --> 01:48:54,699
We're almost on him.

1586
01:48:54,699 --> 01:49:01,479
Those of this son of a bitch we got with us is talking true.

1587
01:49:01,479 --> 01:49:05,960
But if it's what he says it is, and Cole Modrisko's here,

1588
01:49:07,079 --> 01:49:11,159
we can end years of fighting here and now.

1589
01:49:11,159 --> 01:49:12,279
Okay, now cut.

1590
01:49:12,279 --> 01:49:13,239
Skid turds?

1591
01:49:14,039 --> 01:49:14,199
What?

1592
01:49:14,199 --> 01:49:14,680
No, no.

1593
01:49:18,460 --> 01:49:20,859
Hold R1 and X while moving.

1594
01:49:25,100 --> 01:49:26,380
Why did I go right through that?

1595
01:49:27,020 --> 01:49:27,420
Hold on.

1596
01:49:27,420 --> 01:49:27,659
Wait, wait.

1597
01:49:27,659 --> 01:49:28,140
I've unlocked.

1598
01:49:28,140 --> 01:49:28,460
Hold on.

1599
01:49:31,020 --> 01:49:32,699
There we go.

1600
01:49:32,699 --> 01:49:35,819
So if you hold R1, he's going to move around.

1601
01:49:36,859 --> 01:49:37,500
It's a handbrake.

1602
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:46,720
I wish I had that an hour ago.

1603
01:49:46,720 --> 01:49:47,600
Good thing I unlocked it.

1604
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:56,560
It's an ambush.

1605
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:56,960
Look out.

1606
01:49:56,960 --> 01:49:57,359
Oh, no.

1607
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:08,619
Okay.

1608
01:50:08,619 --> 01:50:10,680
I got my knife out.

1609
01:50:10,680 --> 01:50:11,880
Who am I going to have to throw this at?

1610
01:50:13,239 --> 01:50:15,079
Just the other side of this hill.

1611
01:50:15,079 --> 01:50:15,399
Okay.

1612
01:50:16,199 --> 01:50:17,560
Off your horses.

1613
01:50:17,560 --> 01:50:19,319
The console is on PS4.

1614
01:50:19,319 --> 01:50:21,079
You're going to get them knives.

1615
01:50:21,079 --> 01:50:22,439
I said easy.

1616
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:27,159
Off the horses, got the knife.

1617
01:50:29,039 --> 01:50:29,600
First person.

1618
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:30,079
Follow me.

1619
01:50:30,079 --> 01:50:30,720
All right.

1620
01:50:30,720 --> 01:50:31,840
It ain't far.

1621
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:35,119
We might have shared a horse, but we ain't friends.

1622
01:50:35,119 --> 01:50:36,920
Remember, watching you.

1623
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:42,960
Every one guy.

1624
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:44,640
Well, that's interesting, isn't it?

1625
01:50:45,439 --> 01:50:56,319
How do I throw?

1626
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:00,159
Is this not throwing a knife?

1627
01:51:00,159 --> 01:51:00,720
Hold on.

1628
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:09,550
Is this not throwing a knife?

1629
01:51:10,750 --> 01:51:12,670
The cabin's in the clearing down there.

1630
01:51:12,670 --> 01:51:15,960
There'll be a bunch of fellers hiding out there, too.

1631
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:17,319
Are these fellers armed?

1632
01:51:17,319 --> 01:51:17,800
Armed?

1633
01:51:17,800 --> 01:51:18,439
No, it's by the rope.

1634
01:51:18,439 --> 01:51:18,840
Okay.

1635
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:19,720
Where are your strangers?

1636
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:20,520
Yep.

1637
01:51:20,520 --> 01:51:21,930
In Mojisco?

1638
01:51:21,930 --> 01:51:23,369
He'll be holed up in his cabin.

1639
01:51:23,369 --> 01:51:24,409
Stealth mission incoming.

1640
01:51:24,409 --> 01:51:24,810
Stealth?

1641
01:51:24,810 --> 01:51:25,689
Who's blind?

1642
01:51:25,689 --> 01:51:26,810
Likely is not.

1643
01:51:26,810 --> 01:51:27,850
And over there.

1644
01:51:27,850 --> 01:51:28,569
Someone's coming.

1645
01:51:29,369 --> 01:51:30,810
So, uh, is this going to tell him

1646
01:51:30,810 --> 01:51:31,850
we got another bit of pot?

1647
01:51:38,539 --> 01:51:39,579
I'll catch up.

1648
01:51:39,579 --> 01:51:40,300
It's a good idea.

1649
01:51:40,300 --> 01:51:40,539
All right.

1650
01:51:40,539 --> 01:51:43,659
So I got a throwing knife in his body's pain.

1651
01:51:43,659 --> 01:51:44,859
So you can tell him yourself.

1652
01:51:45,739 --> 01:51:47,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1653
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:50,600
If anyone's actually going to shoot the messenger,

1654
01:51:50,600 --> 01:51:52,279
it'd be that mean son of a bitch.

1655
01:51:53,159 --> 01:51:57,680
Okay.

1656
01:51:57,680 --> 01:52:02,460
What are we doing about the pisser, Morgan?

1657
01:52:03,020 --> 01:52:10,010
By the tree.

1658
01:52:10,010 --> 01:52:10,409
Wait.

1659
01:52:10,409 --> 01:52:10,970
Oh, no.

1660
01:52:24,039 --> 01:52:24,439
Okay.

1661
01:52:25,399 --> 01:52:33,159
I had to clean off.

1662
01:52:34,270 --> 01:52:35,390
How did he survive?

1663
01:52:36,189 --> 01:52:37,149
How did the guy to the right?

1664
01:52:38,350 --> 01:52:39,630
How did he live through that, man?

1665
01:52:48,199 --> 01:52:49,000
Take the lead.

1666
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:49,640
Throw a weapon.

1667
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:51,659
How do I aim this?

1668
01:52:52,670 --> 01:52:54,189
Is it like a bunch of drop or anything?

1669
01:52:54,189 --> 01:52:55,310
You want me to take him?

1670
01:52:55,310 --> 01:52:56,970
Nothing else from you.

1671
01:53:01,180 --> 01:53:01,979
Throw?

1672
01:53:01,979 --> 01:53:04,329
Stay here.

1673
01:53:05,340 --> 01:53:07,100
Don't you damn move.

1674
01:53:07,100 --> 01:53:17,239
It's on.

1675
01:53:17,239 --> 01:53:17,960
We move quick.

1676
01:53:47,020 --> 01:53:47,819
Let me start it over.

1677
01:53:55,159 --> 01:53:56,760
I want to like do it correct.

1678
01:53:56,760 --> 01:54:10,159
What are we doing about the pisser, Morgan?

1679
01:54:10,159 --> 01:54:10,399
All right.

1680
01:54:10,399 --> 01:54:11,279
So this was going to happen.

1681
01:54:11,279 --> 01:54:12,319
You, uh, Bill.

1682
01:54:13,439 --> 01:54:14,159
Bill, you're going in.

1683
01:54:14,720 --> 01:54:15,220
Okay.

1684
01:54:32,409 --> 01:54:32,909
Nice work.

1685
01:54:45,130 --> 01:54:46,170
No, I don't want these on.

1686
01:54:46,170 --> 01:54:47,289
I want like the regular knife.

1687
01:54:51,149 --> 01:54:57,899
Let's get close to these two.

1688
01:54:57,899 --> 01:55:00,300
Make sure you're going left to right.

1689
01:55:01,180 --> 01:55:05,449
I don't, I don't know how to stab somebody in the back.

1690
01:55:07,689 --> 01:55:08,810
Is it R2?

1691
01:55:08,810 --> 01:55:09,850
I've not, I haven't done this yet.

1692
01:55:11,130 --> 01:55:11,770
Oh, god damn it.

1693
01:55:11,770 --> 01:55:12,329
I don't know how to do it.

1694
01:55:19,850 --> 01:55:20,890
I was about to greet the guy.

1695
01:55:40,039 --> 01:55:41,159
Hello there.

1696
01:55:41,159 --> 01:55:41,479
Stab.

1697
01:55:45,340 --> 01:55:45,979
Got on the log.

1698
01:55:47,850 --> 01:55:48,890
Don't shoot Bill.

1699
01:55:51,630 --> 01:55:52,750
I've okay.

1700
01:55:52,750 --> 01:56:03,550
Come on, John.

1701
01:56:03,550 --> 01:56:10,430
Go for it.

1702
01:56:10,430 --> 01:56:11,310
Brutal.

1703
01:56:11,310 --> 01:56:17,500
All right.

1704
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:19,979
So we're each going to throw knives at everybody over there.

1705
01:56:20,619 --> 01:56:22,590
Okay.

1706
01:56:22,590 --> 01:56:23,470
Let's do, hold on a minute.

1707
01:56:23,470 --> 01:56:24,109
Stay there, John.

1708
01:56:24,750 --> 01:56:31,449
Stop, stop, stop.

1709
01:56:31,449 --> 01:56:59,479
Should I, oh, I warned him.

1710
01:57:01,979 --> 01:57:02,380
Whoops.

1711
01:57:03,420 --> 01:57:03,899
It's on.

1712
01:57:03,899 --> 01:57:04,380
Let's do it.

1713
01:57:05,180 --> 01:57:05,659
Dead Eye.

1714
01:57:09,100 --> 01:57:09,899
Time for Dead Eye.

1715
01:57:13,840 --> 01:57:15,199
What happened with that?

1716
01:57:15,199 --> 01:57:15,520
Okay.

1717
01:57:16,479 --> 01:57:27,079
Watch out, John.

1718
01:57:27,079 --> 01:57:27,880
John, get out of the way.

1719
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:29,479
Okay.

1720
01:57:29,479 --> 01:57:30,520
John, please kill him.

1721
01:57:30,520 --> 01:57:31,560
Thank you.

1722
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:37,020
Who's left?

1723
01:57:37,020 --> 01:57:41,869
I got a tomahawk?

1724
01:57:50,859 --> 01:57:51,659
Ow.

1725
01:57:51,899 --> 01:58:01,529
That guy fucking comes from.

1726
01:58:01,529 --> 01:58:05,449
I gotta get a better spot.

1727
01:58:05,449 --> 01:58:06,409
Give me a better weapon, too.

1728
01:58:06,409 --> 01:58:07,050
Give me this thing.

1729
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:23,399
What?

1730
01:58:23,399 --> 01:58:25,449
I just pulled the guy's head off.

1731
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:43,880
Okay.

1732
01:58:43,880 --> 01:58:44,119
Got him.

1733
01:58:48,119 --> 01:58:49,000
Where's my shotgun?

1734
01:58:53,310 --> 01:58:54,109
That's even better.

1735
01:58:55,239 --> 01:58:55,960
There's a guy in here.

1736
01:59:02,329 --> 01:59:02,810
I'm ready.

1737
01:59:04,590 --> 01:59:04,989
I'm ready.

1738
01:59:04,989 --> 01:59:05,869
Once this guy opens the door,

1739
01:59:05,869 --> 01:59:06,989
I'm going to tomahawk him right in the head.

1740
01:59:12,359 --> 01:59:12,680
Hello.

1741
01:59:16,039 --> 01:59:16,279
What?

1742
01:59:16,279 --> 01:59:17,239
I was going to do it to you.

1743
01:59:31,159 --> 01:59:32,039
All right.

1744
01:59:32,039 --> 01:59:32,760
Browse the place.

1745
01:59:48,779 --> 01:59:49,340
That's a good point.

1746
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:14,640
So it's the first full body shot we've had in like an hour.

1747
02:00:14,640 --> 02:00:14,880
Come on.

1748
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:21,369
Let's get the camp.

1749
02:00:22,010 --> 02:00:23,289
So you got the cash then?

1750
02:00:23,289 --> 02:00:24,329
What cash?

1751
02:00:24,329 --> 02:00:27,210
Here's usually some cash in the chimney.

1752
02:00:27,210 --> 02:00:28,489
I'll check it.

1753
02:00:28,489 --> 02:00:30,970
Rest of you boys get the cab quick.

1754
02:00:30,970 --> 02:00:31,770
See Arthur?

1755
02:00:31,770 --> 02:00:32,970
I ain't so bad.

1756
02:00:32,970 --> 02:00:33,609
Hey, Bill.

1757
02:00:34,489 --> 02:00:38,090
You tell Dutch old Karen ain't worth killing just yet.

1758
02:00:38,729 --> 02:00:39,369
You're right.

1759
02:00:39,369 --> 02:00:39,850
You are.

1760
02:00:40,569 --> 02:00:40,890
All right.

1761
02:00:40,890 --> 02:00:41,689
Cash in the chimney.

1762
02:00:42,649 --> 02:00:43,130
You got it.

1763
02:00:46,479 --> 02:00:51,550
Slugs, shock and shells, biscuits and all that stuff.

1764
02:00:52,430 --> 02:00:53,149
Kill that guy.

1765
02:00:53,789 --> 02:00:57,819
I'm not going to kill him yet.

1766
02:00:58,760 --> 02:00:59,319
Pots and pans?

1767
02:00:59,319 --> 02:00:59,800
What's in here?

1768
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:00,600
Kentucky bourbon?

1769
02:01:01,239 --> 02:01:03,399
I can't carry any more Kentucky bourbon.

1770
02:01:03,960 --> 02:01:19,100
Well, why the hell not?

1771
02:01:19,100 --> 02:01:19,579
Now I can.

1772
02:01:20,699 --> 02:01:24,619
Just replace it.

1773
02:01:31,210 --> 02:01:32,090
Chimney.

1774
02:01:32,090 --> 02:01:32,729
Money clip.

1775
02:01:33,369 --> 02:01:34,090
How much is in there?

1776
02:01:35,739 --> 02:01:36,380
13 bucks.

1777
02:01:36,380 --> 02:01:36,939
That's not bad.

1778
02:01:36,939 --> 02:01:37,340
More money.

1779
02:01:38,840 --> 02:01:39,960
How many money clips are over here?

1780
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:40,279
12.

1781
02:01:40,279 --> 02:01:41,079
There's another one right there.

1782
02:01:42,409 --> 02:01:42,729
Damn.

1783
02:01:45,119 --> 02:01:46,560
They're going right into the donation box.

1784
02:01:47,119 --> 02:01:48,239
No, donation box.

1785
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:49,359
Box.

1786
02:01:49,359 --> 02:01:50,399
Why can I not say that word?

1787
02:01:51,279 --> 02:01:52,479
Search the draw.

1788
02:01:54,939 --> 02:01:55,500
Snake oil.

1789
02:01:55,500 --> 02:01:56,539
Can I take any more snake oil?

1790
02:01:57,100 --> 02:01:59,210
I can.

1791
02:01:59,210 --> 02:01:59,850
Anything else?

1792
02:02:03,930 --> 02:02:04,430
Box.

1793
02:02:06,859 --> 02:02:07,659
Money in the chimney.

1794
02:02:07,659 --> 02:02:10,060
Ooh, double-barreled shotgun.

1795
02:02:11,159 --> 02:02:13,079
Yeah, I believe so.

1796
02:02:15,359 --> 02:02:16,000
Oh, man.

1797
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:21,949
Clean the double-barreled shotgun.

1798
02:02:22,590 --> 02:02:33,579
Cleaning weapons with gun oil will improve their condition and performance.

1799
02:02:33,579 --> 02:02:34,140
Okay, cool.

1800
02:02:34,779 --> 02:02:37,119
That's cool.

1801
02:02:38,779 --> 02:02:39,899
Any more dust on it?

1802
02:02:40,539 --> 02:02:43,449
It looks good.

1803
02:02:44,010 --> 02:02:49,020
Looks really good, actually.

1804
02:02:49,819 --> 02:02:53,420
All right, let's put it back.

1805
02:02:54,140 --> 02:02:55,739
All right.

1806
02:02:55,739 --> 02:02:56,779
Search the chimney.

1807
02:02:56,779 --> 02:02:57,180
Chimney.

1808
02:03:04,090 --> 02:03:04,409
Six.

1809
02:03:05,369 --> 02:03:09,390
Holy fuck.

1810
02:03:09,390 --> 02:03:15,239
That's a lot of money.

1811
02:03:19,159 --> 02:03:19,800
$600.

1812
02:03:20,760 --> 02:03:21,470
Let's see.

1813
02:03:21,470 --> 02:03:22,109
Mission complete.

1814
02:03:22,670 --> 02:03:25,199
Under the threat of torture,

1815
02:03:25,199 --> 02:03:27,920
Ciaran leads Arthur, John, and Bill up to Six Point Cabin

1816
02:03:27,920 --> 02:03:31,739
where he claims Old Driscoll is holed up.

1817
02:03:32,380 --> 02:03:34,189
I got an F.

1818
02:03:44,119 --> 02:03:44,760
Now, let's head back.

1819
02:03:45,560 --> 02:03:50,909
Okay.

1820
02:03:50,909 --> 02:03:51,390
Anybody?

1821
02:03:51,390 --> 02:03:53,550
Actually, this body's to check over here.

1822
02:03:55,710 --> 02:03:56,670
Redo.

1823
02:03:56,670 --> 02:03:57,550
No, we don't need a redo.

1824
02:03:58,189 --> 02:04:01,130
We don't need a do-over.

1825
02:04:03,130 --> 02:04:04,090
What is that animal?

1826
02:04:04,890 --> 02:04:06,090
That's like a skunk wolf.

1827
02:04:06,090 --> 02:04:06,569
What is this?

1828
02:04:10,170 --> 02:04:10,569
No, no.

1829
02:04:10,569 --> 02:04:11,210
What is that thing?

1830
02:04:11,770 --> 02:04:15,210
Hold on.

1831
02:04:15,210 --> 02:04:16,170
I got to catch the skunk wolf.

1832
02:04:16,810 --> 02:04:20,140
Study.

1833
02:04:21,800 --> 02:04:22,279
Study.

1834
02:04:24,680 --> 02:04:25,079
Study.

1835
02:04:26,840 --> 02:04:29,659
I thought I could have had it.

1836
02:04:29,659 --> 02:04:33,020
There he is.

1837
02:04:33,020 --> 02:04:43,229
God damn it.

1838
02:04:43,229 --> 02:04:44,590
Next time I'll get the skunk wolf.

1839
02:04:44,590 --> 02:04:45,789
It'll happen.

1840
02:04:45,789 --> 02:04:53,100
I can't.

1841
02:04:53,100 --> 02:04:53,819
I'm trying to jump.

1842
02:04:54,380 --> 02:04:56,729
Trying to jump inside of his cabin.

1843
02:04:58,010 --> 02:04:58,890
Oh, shit.

1844
02:04:58,890 --> 02:04:59,609
It didn't work.

1845
02:05:00,970 --> 02:05:01,289
Hey.

1846
02:05:17,789 --> 02:05:19,069
Why is it still going?

1847
02:05:19,069 --> 02:05:19,470
Wait.

1848
02:05:20,279 --> 02:05:20,600
Wait.

1849
02:05:21,399 --> 02:05:34,189
Ooh.

1850
02:05:34,189 --> 02:05:35,630
What is in here?

1851
02:05:39,949 --> 02:05:40,670
Why is it still?

1852
02:05:40,670 --> 02:05:41,630
Yeah, it's not a car.

1853
02:05:41,630 --> 02:05:42,430
What am I talking?

1854
02:05:42,430 --> 02:05:43,789
It's not like you're stepping on gas.

1855
02:05:44,670 --> 02:05:46,109
Seven repeater cartridges.

1856
02:05:47,069 --> 02:05:49,159
Pistol cartridges.

1857
02:05:49,159 --> 02:05:49,640
Damn.

1858
02:05:49,640 --> 02:05:50,600
What else you got in here?

1859
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:53,359
What?

1860
02:05:53,359 --> 02:05:56,279
No, don't stand on the box.

1861
02:05:58,760 --> 02:05:59,079
Chest.

1862
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:02,800
Herbivore bait.

1863
02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:05,680
Predator bait.

1864
02:06:08,859 --> 02:06:09,819
Shotgun shells.

1865
02:06:09,819 --> 02:06:10,619
That's a lot of stuff.

1866
02:06:11,340 --> 02:06:16,000
That's it, right?

1867
02:06:19,739 --> 02:06:21,340
It's a bunch of vegan food.

1868
02:06:23,579 --> 02:06:24,380
What about the horses?

1869
02:06:24,380 --> 02:06:26,300
These look like good horses.

1870
02:06:26,300 --> 02:06:26,779
Can I?

1871
02:06:26,779 --> 02:06:27,420
What about this guy?

1872
02:06:27,420 --> 02:06:29,420
I can throw this guy off and loot his body, right?

1873
02:06:35,039 --> 02:06:35,279
What?

1874
02:06:36,750 --> 02:06:37,310
Oh, fuck.

1875
02:06:37,310 --> 02:06:37,710
Oh.

1876
02:06:37,710 --> 02:06:38,270
Oh, fuck.

1877
02:06:38,270 --> 02:06:38,750
Oh, fuck.

1878
02:06:39,390 --> 02:06:39,869
Oh, fuck.

1879
02:06:40,590 --> 02:06:41,069
Oh, fuck.

1880
02:06:41,069 --> 02:06:41,949
What if I pretend it's mine?

1881
02:06:51,560 --> 02:06:51,880
Hey.

1882
02:07:15,470 --> 02:07:18,460
Hey.

1883
02:07:18,460 --> 02:07:18,699
Wait.

1884
02:07:18,699 --> 02:07:18,939
Hey.

1885
02:07:19,739 --> 02:07:32,460
What?

1886
02:07:32,460 --> 02:07:33,930
Oh, jeez.

1887
02:07:33,930 --> 02:07:35,529
It's just too many people here now.

1888
02:07:36,409 --> 02:07:42,590
Who are these?

1889
02:07:42,590 --> 02:07:43,630
Hey, get.

1890
02:07:45,630 --> 02:07:46,109
Come here.

1891
02:07:49,449 --> 02:07:50,250
Get up.

1892
02:07:50,250 --> 02:07:51,289
Where's my horse?

1893
02:07:52,329 --> 02:07:53,210
Where's my horse?

1894
02:07:56,729 --> 02:07:58,569
Oh, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1895
02:07:59,449 --> 02:08:02,649
All right.

1896
02:08:02,649 --> 02:08:03,130
Settle down.

1897
02:08:04,090 --> 02:08:04,890
Wait.

1898
02:08:04,890 --> 02:08:05,760
I found him.

1899
02:08:21,680 --> 02:08:22,079
Where?

1900
02:08:22,079 --> 02:08:22,640
Where?

1901
02:08:22,640 --> 02:08:23,199
Where is he?

1902
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:24,239
Where did he?

1903
02:08:24,880 --> 02:08:36,300
There he is.

1904
02:08:36,300 --> 02:08:36,859
That's not it.

1905
02:08:36,859 --> 02:08:37,899
These are two different animals.

1906
02:08:38,460 --> 02:08:38,779
Sorry.

1907
02:08:38,779 --> 02:08:39,180
Study.

1908
02:08:41,529 --> 02:08:42,170
Got it.

1909
02:08:42,170 --> 02:08:44,000
I thought that just said threaten.

1910
02:08:48,140 --> 02:08:48,779
Almost got it.

1911
02:08:49,659 --> 02:08:51,739
All right.

1912
02:08:51,739 --> 02:08:53,500
We're fine.

1913
02:08:53,500 --> 02:08:54,300
Let me pet the horse.

1914
02:08:54,300 --> 02:08:55,340
Yeah, good boy.

1915
02:08:55,340 --> 02:09:00,569
You're just, you're doing fine.

1916
02:09:00,569 --> 02:09:00,890
You're good.

1917
02:09:03,920 --> 02:09:10,199
That guy, I could loot that guy's body when he was on the ground.

1918
02:09:10,199 --> 02:09:10,920
I thought he was dead.

1919
02:09:39,630 --> 02:09:40,270
That's funny.

1920
02:09:41,710 --> 02:09:43,390
No, I can't go this way.

1921
02:09:43,390 --> 02:09:44,350
It's not a car.

1922
02:09:44,350 --> 02:09:46,750
Why can't it just be, why can't it be armor on his legs?

1923
02:09:47,229 --> 02:09:49,239
Yeah.

1924
02:09:49,239 --> 02:09:49,720
Calm down.

1925
02:09:49,720 --> 02:09:50,359
Everything's fine.

1926
02:09:54,760 --> 02:09:55,479
I got to go home.

1927
02:09:57,039 --> 02:09:57,600
New mission.

1928
02:10:29,130 --> 02:10:30,010
Why am I dead eye?

1929
02:10:30,810 --> 02:10:37,079
Study.

1930
02:11:00,989 --> 02:11:02,109
Big animal.

1931
02:11:02,109 --> 02:11:03,680
All right.

1932
02:11:03,680 --> 02:11:04,720
Let's get a way point here.

1933
02:11:05,359 --> 02:11:09,210
What the hell am I?

1934
02:11:09,210 --> 02:11:09,369
Okay.

1935
02:11:09,369 --> 02:11:10,649
This is bounty $25.

1936
02:11:11,770 --> 02:11:15,180
Where did I end up?

1937
02:11:15,180 --> 02:11:17,180
Am I, I still have a bounty?

1938
02:11:21,039 --> 02:11:22,880
Do I have to pay these guys or get rid of these guys?

1939
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:23,920
I think I have to get rid of these guys.

1940
02:11:24,560 --> 02:11:25,770
Now I got to get rid of these guys.

1941
02:11:26,729 --> 02:11:27,210
All right.

1942
02:11:27,210 --> 02:11:28,010
I'm going to go pay it off.

1943
02:11:28,810 --> 02:11:30,460
So I'm just going to go this way.

1944
02:11:31,420 --> 02:11:51,399
So can I talk to them or is that a bounty hunter?

1945
02:11:54,250 --> 02:11:58,189
No, I think he's just, oh, well, it is.

1946
02:12:03,149 --> 02:12:03,869
It is these guys.

1947
02:12:03,869 --> 02:12:04,350
No, it's not.

1948
02:12:15,920 --> 02:12:16,560
Robin Hood.

1949
02:12:17,359 --> 02:12:19,279
Sheriff Nottingham, you're done stand a chance.

1950
02:12:31,800 --> 02:12:32,119
Okay.

1951
02:12:32,119 --> 02:12:36,460
I need to heal.

1952
02:12:36,460 --> 02:12:39,500
Let's go with the, let's do some more Kentucky bourbon.

1953
02:12:39,500 --> 02:12:39,819
Why not?

1954
02:12:40,699 --> 02:12:48,250
Your health core is empty.

1955
02:12:48,810 --> 02:12:49,449
Oh yeah.

1956
02:12:49,449 --> 02:12:50,010
You need to eat.

1957
02:12:52,909 --> 02:12:53,229
Okay.

1958
02:12:53,229 --> 02:12:56,859
We got, I thought I could eat the glove.

1959
02:12:58,460 --> 02:12:59,020
I'm hungry.

1960
02:12:59,020 --> 02:12:59,739
Smoke a cigar.

1961
02:13:00,300 --> 02:13:01,020
Canned peaches.

1962
02:13:01,739 --> 02:13:04,270
Okay.

1963
02:13:04,270 --> 02:13:04,590
There we go.

1964
02:13:04,590 --> 02:13:05,979
We're good.

1965
02:13:05,979 --> 02:13:18,119
Maybe one more of those back to what we were doing.

1966
02:13:23,659 --> 02:13:24,539
Health is fine.

1967
02:13:24,539 --> 02:13:31,130
Stamina is not great, but now that my bounty is taken care of,

1968
02:13:31,850 --> 02:13:38,989
I don't want to work them too hard.

1969
02:13:38,989 --> 02:13:39,949
Don't work the horse too hard.

1970
02:13:40,670 --> 02:13:41,550
He doesn't deserve that.

1971
02:13:41,550 --> 02:13:42,590
How do you feed the horse?

1972
02:13:42,590 --> 02:13:44,109
Everyone's saying feed horse, feed horse.

1973
02:13:48,970 --> 02:13:49,609
Excuse me.

1974
02:13:54,640 --> 02:13:58,810
Oh, I got to get, I got to kill five rabbits on horseback

1975
02:13:58,810 --> 02:13:59,930
and I got to unlock a super move.

1976
02:14:10,989 --> 02:14:11,630
Here, eat this.

1977
02:14:12,510 --> 02:14:13,310
Why am I getting the gun?

1978
02:14:20,560 --> 02:14:21,439
See, he's fine.

1979
02:14:27,579 --> 02:14:28,140
Rabbit meat.

1980
02:14:31,550 --> 02:14:32,430
I'm going to skip the rabbit.

1981
02:14:34,060 --> 02:14:34,539
I want to do this.

1982
02:14:34,539 --> 02:14:35,739
Let me just get five rabbits.

1983
02:14:38,109 --> 02:14:38,829
Holy shit.

1984
02:14:44,029 --> 02:14:44,350
Okay.

1985
02:14:44,989 --> 02:14:50,760
I just revealed the Scooby Doo monster.

1986
02:14:51,399 --> 02:14:52,380
That was pretty wild.

1987
02:14:52,380 --> 02:14:53,100
All right.

1988
02:14:53,100 --> 02:14:56,279
Let me do, let me do a few more rabbits.

1989
02:14:59,420 --> 02:15:02,220
I want to get the four more rabbits so I can unlock something.

1990
02:15:03,689 --> 02:15:04,649
Tell me if you see any rabbits.

1991
02:15:04,649 --> 02:15:06,250
Just scream as loud as you can if you see one.

1992
02:15:18,109 --> 02:15:19,149
I've seen a lot of people scream.

1993
02:15:19,149 --> 02:15:21,630
I don't see any rabbits though, unfortunately guys.

1994
02:15:22,270 --> 02:15:24,510
I don't know what the fuck this bullshit is that you guys are doing.

1995
02:15:25,310 --> 02:15:33,720
I don't know what kind of bullshit you guys are running here.

1996
02:15:34,520 --> 02:15:51,310
I almost PUBG'd that guy.

1997
02:15:51,310 --> 02:15:52,350
That would've been pretty crazy.

1998
02:15:58,010 --> 02:16:16,439
That was not that far.

1999
02:16:17,239 --> 02:16:18,989
That was not far.

2000
02:16:21,390 --> 02:16:22,829
That really wasn't that far.

2001
02:16:22,829 --> 02:16:24,829
That was maybe eight feet.

2002
02:16:25,550 --> 02:16:32,459
This is going to be like an RPG.

2003
02:16:32,459 --> 02:16:34,459
Anytime I play a turn-based RPG,

2004
02:16:34,459 --> 02:16:36,780
I'm so bad at managing everybody's health

2005
02:16:36,780 --> 02:16:39,579
that instead of buying the thing that heals a party member,

2006
02:16:39,659 --> 02:16:41,979
I just buy like 60 revives.

2007
02:16:42,620 --> 02:16:43,899
Because they come back with full health.

2008
02:16:43,899 --> 02:16:45,500
Just, you know, let them die and bring them back.

2009
02:16:59,639 --> 02:17:01,879
Let's take this scenery in, for God's sakes.

2010
02:17:07,469 --> 02:17:08,030
He wastes...

2011
02:17:08,030 --> 02:17:08,829
All right, wait, wait, wait.

2012
02:17:08,829 --> 02:17:11,389
I'm critical with stamina right now.

2013
02:17:13,360 --> 02:17:13,760
Let's see.

2014
02:17:13,760 --> 02:17:14,959
I got canned peas.

2015
02:17:15,600 --> 02:17:17,120
I need something more substantial than that.

2016
02:17:23,899 --> 02:17:24,540
That's all right.

2017
02:17:31,200 --> 02:17:31,600
Did I...

2018
02:17:36,079 --> 02:17:37,040
Canned strawberry, did it.

2019
02:17:37,840 --> 02:17:41,370
I can't use...

2020
02:17:41,370 --> 02:17:42,889
I can't eat strawberries when I'm on a horse.

2021
02:17:43,690 --> 02:17:44,190
Why?

2022
02:17:44,829 --> 02:17:46,459
Because the horse is stamina.

2023
02:17:46,459 --> 02:17:47,500
Well, then let's feed him.

2024
02:17:47,500 --> 02:17:49,020
God, come on, man.

2025
02:17:49,659 --> 02:17:56,100
Feed him.

2026
02:17:57,440 --> 02:18:09,040
There he goes.

2027
02:18:09,040 --> 02:18:09,540
He's fine.

2028
02:18:10,079 --> 02:18:11,600
Let's clean him.

2029
02:18:12,319 --> 02:18:15,920
Wait, I can clean him like this?

2030
02:18:16,719 --> 02:18:24,000
Let's...

2031
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:24,959
I can brush him from here.

2032
02:18:26,079 --> 02:18:27,840
I can study him.

2033
02:18:29,280 --> 02:18:30,879
Oh, I learned about my horse.

2034
02:18:31,520 --> 02:18:35,069
Okay, let's go.

2035
02:18:35,069 --> 02:18:37,299
Not with a saddle on.

2036
02:18:39,889 --> 02:18:40,850
What is a horse core?

2037
02:18:41,729 --> 02:18:42,979
Uh, that's...

2038
02:18:44,850 --> 02:18:45,350
I don't know.

2039
02:18:48,620 --> 02:18:56,510
Almost back to camp.

2040
02:18:57,469 --> 02:18:58,110
No scenic route.

2041
02:18:58,110 --> 02:18:58,610
Let's just go.

2042
02:19:01,950 --> 02:19:04,190
Intel horse 2 duo.

2043
02:19:08,799 --> 02:19:09,299
Pretty good.

2044
02:19:10,350 --> 02:19:10,909
Pretty close.

2045
02:19:23,219 --> 02:19:24,020
More things to study.

2046
02:19:24,819 --> 02:19:32,750
I hope I didn't have the stupid Bambi on my back.

2047
02:19:33,469 --> 02:19:35,979
We're going downhill.

2048
02:19:35,979 --> 02:19:36,860
This is going pretty fast.

2049
02:19:37,500 --> 02:19:42,850
What are these?

2050
02:19:43,549 --> 02:19:45,069
Is it a pig?

2051
02:19:45,790 --> 02:19:57,170
Got it.

2052
02:19:57,170 --> 02:20:02,829
Well, I learned about it.

2053
02:20:02,829 --> 02:20:04,030
This is gonna be okay, right?

2054
02:20:04,030 --> 02:20:04,530
Yeah.

2055
02:20:06,659 --> 02:20:07,159
Almost back.

2056
02:20:07,780 --> 02:20:11,579
How many giga horse does it...

2057
02:20:11,579 --> 02:20:12,079
What's wrong with them?

2058
02:20:13,229 --> 02:20:13,870
What?

2059
02:20:13,870 --> 02:20:14,370
Bill.

2060
02:20:18,590 --> 02:20:19,549
We're fine.

2061
02:20:19,549 --> 02:20:20,030
It's me.

2062
02:20:20,030 --> 02:20:20,350
What?

2063
02:20:20,350 --> 02:20:21,549
They don't know what I look like?

2064
02:20:22,270 --> 02:20:27,059
I guess everyone looks like they're in the same clothes.

2065
02:20:27,860 --> 02:20:29,260
We're far away.

2066
02:20:29,899 --> 02:20:31,659
These guys have binoculars though, right?

2067
02:20:33,549 --> 02:20:34,350
All right.

2068
02:20:34,350 --> 02:20:34,829
How we doing?

2069
02:20:34,829 --> 02:20:36,030
How's the land doing here?

2070
02:20:36,829 --> 02:20:37,870
$53.

2071
02:20:37,870 --> 02:20:38,590
We're doing pretty well.

2072
02:20:41,940 --> 02:20:42,440
Not yet.

2073
02:20:42,899 --> 02:20:48,379
Let me bring the carcass to this guy.

2074
02:20:50,879 --> 02:20:52,719
Is there no running rule in camp or something?

2075
02:20:52,719 --> 02:20:53,520
Why can't I not run?

2076
02:20:58,610 --> 02:20:59,489
All right, I've got something for you.

2077
02:21:01,520 --> 02:21:02,159
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2078
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:06,479
Satchel rule.

2079
02:21:06,479 --> 02:21:07,680
Perch leather working to upgrade.

2080
02:21:07,760 --> 02:21:08,479
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2081
02:21:08,479 --> 02:21:09,040
I don't...

2082
02:21:09,040 --> 02:21:10,000
Perfect deer pelt.

2083
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:10,879
Perfect buck pelt.

2084
02:21:10,879 --> 02:21:12,479
Perfect elk pelt.

2085
02:21:12,479 --> 02:21:13,200
I can't.

2086
02:21:13,200 --> 02:21:13,680
I need...

2087
02:21:14,399 --> 02:21:15,569
Well, let's bring it to him.

2088
02:21:19,709 --> 02:21:21,069
Good rabbit pelt.

2089
02:21:21,870 --> 02:21:24,190
That's not perfect.

2090
02:21:26,239 --> 02:21:27,440
Poor deer carcass.

2091
02:21:27,440 --> 02:21:28,239
Zero dollars.

2092
02:21:28,239 --> 02:21:28,739
We'll eat it.

2093
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:32,879
I'm gonna keep that.

2094
02:21:35,860 --> 02:21:41,069
Good job, Arthur.

2095
02:21:41,069 --> 02:21:41,469
What do I got?

2096
02:21:41,469 --> 02:21:42,190
I got 200 bucks.

2097
02:21:42,190 --> 02:21:44,270
I could give some more money to the camp, can't I?

2098
02:21:51,629 --> 02:21:52,030
What do we got?

2099
02:21:52,030 --> 02:21:52,750
53 bucks?

2100
02:22:03,870 --> 02:22:04,190
But is...

2101
02:22:04,190 --> 02:22:05,229
Am I doing this right?

2102
02:22:06,639 --> 02:22:07,200
20 bucks.

2103
02:22:08,610 --> 02:22:09,329
20 dollars.

2104
02:22:13,020 --> 02:22:14,139
74 dollars total.

2105
02:22:19,520 --> 02:22:21,040
I'm unlocking more things, right?

2106
02:22:29,059 --> 02:22:29,459
Okay.

2107
02:22:31,840 --> 02:22:32,399
Big bits.

2108
02:22:33,360 --> 02:22:34,479
It upgrades the camp.

2109
02:22:34,479 --> 02:22:35,360
It seems that way.

2110
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:37,040
Let's eat.

2111
02:22:37,680 --> 02:22:43,020
The more you donate, the better your ending.

2112
02:22:44,739 --> 02:22:45,219
Interesting.

2113
02:22:45,860 --> 02:22:56,930
Let's eat it quick before it goes bad.

2114
02:22:57,649 --> 02:23:02,860
I don't need to clean that?

2115
02:23:02,860 --> 02:23:03,180
Okay.

2116
02:23:10,909 --> 02:23:11,469
All right.

2117
02:23:11,469 --> 02:23:12,270
Where's the ledger?

2118
02:23:12,989 --> 02:23:16,129
Somebody said the ledger next to the donation box.

2119
02:23:16,129 --> 02:23:16,930
Is there one here?

2120
02:23:24,159 --> 02:23:25,200
No, it's not unlocked yet.

2121
02:23:25,200 --> 02:23:25,700
Okay.

2122
02:23:26,079 --> 02:23:26,750
All right.

2123
02:23:26,750 --> 02:23:28,030
I'm gonna just go do...

2124
02:23:28,030 --> 02:23:29,069
There's a lot of missions here.

2125
02:23:32,639 --> 02:23:33,139
D.

2126
02:23:34,979 --> 02:23:35,479
Dutch.

2127
02:23:36,020 --> 02:23:36,520
Or...

2128
02:23:37,299 --> 02:23:37,799
Damn.

2129
02:23:39,200 --> 02:23:39,680
Minimum just...

2130
02:23:39,680 --> 02:23:40,319
I'm standing right here.

2131
02:23:40,319 --> 02:23:41,280
I might as well do it.

2132
02:23:41,280 --> 02:23:41,780
Dutch?

2133
02:23:42,159 --> 02:23:42,879
Miss O'Shea?

2134
02:23:43,520 --> 02:23:44,020
Well.

2135
02:23:44,479 --> 02:23:46,719
Feels like we are finally getting back on our feet.

2136
02:23:47,760 --> 02:23:50,559
You, uh, find a buyer for them bonds we stole?

2137
02:23:50,559 --> 02:23:51,059
Not yet.

2138
02:23:51,760 --> 02:23:53,680
But Jose is working on it.

2139
02:23:53,680 --> 02:23:55,809
When we heading west?

2140
02:23:57,389 --> 02:23:57,889
Soon?

2141
02:23:58,899 --> 02:23:59,399
I don't know.

2142
02:24:01,229 --> 02:24:01,729
Feels like...

2143
02:24:03,069 --> 02:24:04,030
Things have changed.

2144
02:24:04,750 --> 02:24:06,030
The whole world's changed.

2145
02:24:07,440 --> 02:24:09,200
And they don't want folk like us no more.

2146
02:24:10,829 --> 02:24:11,790
We're being hunted.

2147
02:24:12,350 --> 02:24:14,110
We are smarter than them.

2148
02:24:14,110 --> 02:24:17,629
Only the feeblest of men take jobs in the government.

2149
02:24:18,270 --> 02:24:19,229
How do you decent?

2150
02:24:19,229 --> 02:24:20,670
I hope so.

2151
02:24:20,670 --> 02:24:21,170
Trimby?

2152
02:24:21,170 --> 02:24:22,270
Trust Dodge, Mr. Morgan.

2153
02:24:23,149 --> 02:24:23,790
You have to.

2154
02:24:23,790 --> 02:24:24,750
They got Micah!

2155
02:24:25,549 --> 02:24:26,049
Dutch!

2156
02:24:26,430 --> 02:24:27,170
Upper!

2157
02:24:27,729 --> 02:24:28,290
What's going on?

2158
02:24:28,290 --> 02:24:29,010
They got Micah.

2159
02:24:29,010 --> 02:24:29,510
He...

2160
02:24:29,510 --> 02:24:31,010
I'll test it after the, uh, cutscene.

2161
02:24:31,010 --> 02:24:32,049
He was in Strawberry and...

2162
02:24:32,049 --> 02:24:33,010
It's okay, son.

2163
02:24:33,010 --> 02:24:33,510
Breathe.

2164
02:24:34,959 --> 02:24:36,000
They nearly lynched me.

2165
02:24:36,799 --> 02:24:37,299
They...

2166
02:24:37,840 --> 02:24:41,040
They got Micah in the sheriffs in Strawberry.

2167
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:42,479
And there's Tarka hanging him.

2168
02:24:42,479 --> 02:24:43,120
Here's hoping.

2169
02:24:43,760 --> 02:24:44,479
Arthur.

2170
02:24:44,479 --> 02:24:45,280
What?

2171
02:24:45,280 --> 02:24:47,520
The fool brought this on himself.

2172
02:24:47,520 --> 02:24:49,040
You know my feelings about him, Dutch.

2173
02:24:49,040 --> 02:24:52,399
You think I can't see past his bluster to the heart and side?

2174
02:24:52,399 --> 02:24:53,840
He is a fine man.

2175
02:24:53,840 --> 02:24:54,399
No.

2176
02:24:54,399 --> 02:24:56,079
I ain't saving that fool.

2177
02:24:56,079 --> 02:24:57,280
I can't go.

2178
02:24:57,280 --> 02:24:59,200
My face will be all over West Elizabeth.

2179
02:24:59,200 --> 02:25:00,319
I am asking.

2180
02:25:00,879 --> 02:25:01,920
He would do it for you.

2181
02:25:02,559 --> 02:25:07,219
I don't think he would, but fine Arthur.

2182
02:25:07,219 --> 02:25:08,100
You okay, Lenny?

2183
02:25:09,200 --> 02:25:10,000
Yeah.

2184
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:11,040
Of course I'm okay.

2185
02:25:11,040 --> 02:25:12,000
You don't seem okay.

2186
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,079
You take that kid into town.

2187
02:25:14,079 --> 02:25:16,159
Valentine, not Strawberry.

2188
02:25:16,159 --> 02:25:16,879
Get him drunk.

2189
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:18,159
And Arthur?

2190
02:25:18,799 --> 02:25:20,399
No crazy business.

2191
02:25:20,399 --> 02:25:21,680
I'm giving that up.

2192
02:25:21,680 --> 02:25:23,840
And you get Micah out of that jail.

2193
02:25:24,399 --> 02:25:24,899
Jailbreak?

2194
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:27,360
I think I can handle this.

2195
02:25:27,360 --> 02:25:28,000
Come on, son.

2196
02:25:29,040 --> 02:25:30,879
I'll get to it, Dutch.

2197
02:25:30,879 --> 02:25:32,719
Just can't drop everything.

2198
02:25:33,440 --> 02:25:34,059
All right.

2199
02:25:34,059 --> 02:25:34,540
Jailbreak.

2200
02:25:35,340 --> 02:25:37,260
Who's driving?

2201
02:25:37,899 --> 02:25:38,379
Both of us.

2202
02:25:39,260 --> 02:25:43,469
Hold on.

2203
02:25:43,469 --> 02:25:43,950
Let me make sure.

2204
02:25:48,190 --> 02:25:50,459
All right.

2205
02:25:50,459 --> 02:25:53,579
I need someone to break this down for me for just a second here.

2206
02:25:53,579 --> 02:25:54,620
Like just somebody human being.

2207
02:25:56,780 --> 02:26:01,420
So what Deadeye is both sticks together, right?

2208
02:26:01,420 --> 02:26:02,059
At the same time.

2209
02:26:02,780 --> 02:26:07,979
And then you move it around and then press R2 and you're done.

2210
02:26:07,979 --> 02:26:09,180
Or how is it?

2211
02:26:09,180 --> 02:26:09,819
I remember.

2212
02:26:09,819 --> 02:26:10,379
I don't remember.

2213
02:26:11,579 --> 02:26:12,860
It's just R3.

2214
02:26:12,860 --> 02:26:13,100
Okay.

2215
02:26:14,659 --> 02:26:16,020
And then you just aim around.

2216
02:26:16,020 --> 02:26:17,459
Do I have to hold R3?

2217
02:26:17,459 --> 02:26:19,940
R3 and then aim around and then press R2.

2218
02:26:20,819 --> 02:26:28,700
So I have to hold in R3 the whole time.

2219
02:26:28,700 --> 02:26:28,860
Okay.

2220
02:26:28,860 --> 02:26:31,020
Just click it and then I aim around then press R2.

2221
02:26:31,020 --> 02:26:31,579
Okay.

2222
02:26:31,579 --> 02:26:32,379
Don't need to hold anything.

2223
02:26:33,020 --> 02:26:33,979
So my apologies.

2224
02:26:33,979 --> 02:26:36,620
I just kind of threw myself back into the game.

2225
02:26:41,540 --> 02:26:43,059
R3, set shots, take shots.

2226
02:26:43,059 --> 02:26:43,379
Cool.

2227
02:26:43,379 --> 02:26:43,940
All right, let's go.

2228
02:26:44,659 --> 02:26:46,590
Run him over.

2229
02:26:46,590 --> 02:26:47,389
Run these people over.

2230
02:26:49,700 --> 02:26:50,020
Thank you.

2231
02:26:50,739 --> 02:26:51,860
Thank you, Chad.

2232
02:26:52,500 --> 02:26:53,219
Appreciate it.

2233
02:26:57,180 --> 02:26:59,500
Look like you've been through it.

2234
02:26:59,500 --> 02:27:03,700
I'm gonna get off that mountain then this.

2235
02:27:04,340 --> 02:27:07,010
He's got a crazy side off him.

2236
02:27:07,010 --> 02:27:09,010
What are you boys?

2237
02:27:09,010 --> 02:27:11,809
You're supposed to be scouting ahead for us.

2238
02:27:11,809 --> 02:27:14,770
I kept asking him what we was doing but he was...

2239
02:27:14,770 --> 02:27:16,690
You worried too much, kid.

2240
02:27:16,690 --> 02:27:17,889
Just just some business.

2241
02:27:17,889 --> 02:27:19,329
Practice on animals and minerals?

2242
02:27:19,329 --> 02:27:20,209
You know how he is.

2243
02:27:27,709 --> 02:27:28,350
I see a rabbit.

2244
02:27:28,350 --> 02:27:28,909
I gotta shoot it.

2245
02:27:28,909 --> 02:27:30,430
Before we even got there.

2246
02:27:30,430 --> 02:27:32,270
Then we ran into some fellas.

2247
02:27:32,270 --> 02:27:33,549
One of them, Micah New.

2248
02:27:33,549 --> 02:27:34,270
Drank some more.

2249
02:27:34,829 --> 02:27:36,989
And this is supposed to be a dry town we're in too.

2250
02:27:37,629 --> 02:27:39,149
Man, he shoots one of them.

2251
02:27:39,149 --> 02:27:40,270
I don't know how that goes.

2252
02:27:40,270 --> 02:27:42,750
With the swiftness here, man, why would we be taking our time here?

2253
02:27:42,750 --> 02:27:44,670
Happened like the strike of a match.

2254
02:27:44,670 --> 02:27:46,590
The Lord was on his fast too.

2255
02:27:46,590 --> 02:27:49,549
Practice Deadeye on animals.

2256
02:27:49,549 --> 02:27:50,350
But I got a way.

2257
02:27:50,350 --> 02:27:50,909
Just about.

2258
02:27:51,549 --> 02:27:53,469
All right, I got a host of this.

2259
02:27:53,469 --> 02:27:55,149
We'll take care of it.

2260
02:27:55,149 --> 02:27:56,270
So you're gonna go get them?

2261
02:27:57,069 --> 02:27:57,790
I'll come with you.

2262
02:27:58,829 --> 02:27:59,870
You leave it to me.

2263
02:27:59,870 --> 02:28:02,190
For now, let's drink some.

2264
02:28:02,190 --> 02:28:04,030
This game is about taking your time.

2265
02:28:04,030 --> 02:28:06,030
It was Trent that started all this.

2266
02:28:06,030 --> 02:28:06,430
That's true.

2267
02:28:06,430 --> 02:28:07,549
I didn't see the train go by yet.

2268
02:28:08,510 --> 02:28:10,350
Because you know if the train had come by, I would have.

2269
02:28:10,350 --> 02:28:11,469
I would have rowed into it.

2270
02:28:11,469 --> 02:28:11,790
Okay.

2271
02:28:12,430 --> 02:28:20,350
And gone.

2272
02:28:34,620 --> 02:28:35,979
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2273
02:28:35,979 --> 02:28:36,540
Put it away.

2274
02:28:36,540 --> 02:28:37,260
Put it down.

2275
02:28:37,260 --> 02:28:37,659
Oh my.

2276
02:28:40,450 --> 02:28:41,540
Study.

2277
02:28:42,100 --> 02:28:44,129
Okay.

2278
02:28:44,129 --> 02:28:45,010
Kentucky Sadler.

2279
02:28:45,569 --> 02:28:47,020
Kentucky Sadler.

2280
02:28:47,020 --> 02:28:47,260
Got it.

2281
02:28:47,260 --> 02:28:48,299
What about that thing over there?

2282
02:28:48,940 --> 02:28:52,850
Let's go.

2283
02:28:53,409 --> 02:28:54,129
Nice work.

2284
02:28:58,299 --> 02:28:59,819
In fact, I don't want the bow out.

2285
02:28:59,819 --> 02:29:01,420
Give me the carbine.

2286
02:29:01,420 --> 02:29:02,379
Double barreled shotgun.

2287
02:29:02,379 --> 02:29:02,860
Who am I kidding?

2288
02:29:03,819 --> 02:29:04,540
I just got this.

2289
02:29:05,340 --> 02:29:12,559
So we're gonna jailbreak this guy.

2290
02:29:13,200 --> 02:29:18,260
Is this like a stealth thing here or are we just riding in?

2291
02:29:18,979 --> 02:29:20,000
Should I holster this?

2292
02:29:20,799 --> 02:29:32,989
You guys are just in the way.

2293
02:29:32,989 --> 02:29:39,840
Okay, we can move a little faster here.

2294
02:29:53,819 --> 02:29:54,780
Weapon shop right here.

2295
02:29:55,579 --> 02:29:57,309
I will remember that.

2296
02:30:01,379 --> 02:30:01,700
Pitch.

2297
02:30:02,500 --> 02:30:03,700
Oh, we're not.

2298
02:30:04,340 --> 02:30:04,979
We're not.

2299
02:30:04,979 --> 02:30:05,700
We got a different.

2300
02:30:05,700 --> 02:30:06,979
We gotta find a different parking spot.

2301
02:30:07,780 --> 02:30:09,379
That one doesn't work anymore.

2302
02:30:14,819 --> 02:30:15,299
Over here.

2303
02:30:18,180 --> 02:30:21,340
All right, we're good.

2304
02:30:23,940 --> 02:30:24,500
Go to the bar.

2305
02:30:35,329 --> 02:30:35,729
Surprise.

2306
02:30:35,729 --> 02:30:37,090
Oh, it's a surprise birthday.

2307
02:30:38,659 --> 02:30:39,219
Surprise.

2308
02:30:39,940 --> 02:30:43,250
All right, this is what we drink.

2309
02:30:43,250 --> 02:30:46,030
This is a drinking contest.

2310
02:31:03,379 --> 02:31:04,899
I was defending myself.

2311
02:31:04,899 --> 02:31:07,219
Tommy, he'll be fine.

2312
02:31:07,219 --> 02:31:08,420
Have one for yourself.

2313
02:31:09,729 --> 02:31:10,290
Thank you.

2314
02:31:11,409 --> 02:31:11,729
All right.

2315
02:31:14,129 --> 02:31:15,729
Micah seemed to know a lot of people.

2316
02:31:16,610 --> 02:31:17,979
That was the problem.

2317
02:31:17,979 --> 02:31:18,620
How you mean?

2318
02:31:19,260 --> 02:31:23,620
I mean, I don't seen a lot of crazy, crazy stuff.

2319
02:31:23,620 --> 02:31:26,340
Like a crazy, crazy stuff.

2320
02:31:26,340 --> 02:31:27,540
Will you shut up?

2321
02:31:27,540 --> 02:31:28,979
Will you shut up?

2322
02:31:28,979 --> 02:31:29,940
Be quiet, buddy.

2323
02:31:33,219 --> 02:31:34,420
This guy's just being a dick.

2324
02:31:35,059 --> 02:31:35,860
You menace.

2325
02:31:35,860 --> 02:31:36,260
Dull.

2326
02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:40,479
Lead his fool alone.

2327
02:31:41,360 --> 02:31:42,719
Lead the fool alone.

2328
02:31:42,719 --> 02:31:49,489
I'm bored with being left alone.

2329
02:31:49,489 --> 02:31:50,049
Charming.

2330
02:31:50,049 --> 02:31:51,809
Listen, buddy.

2331
02:31:51,809 --> 02:31:53,680
You're a charming fellow.

2332
02:31:54,319 --> 02:31:55,040
One of the best.

2333
02:31:55,760 --> 02:31:58,899
But me and the kid hero, we're trying to talk business.

2334
02:31:58,899 --> 02:31:59,459
Chat.

2335
02:31:59,459 --> 02:32:02,180
Could you possibly leave us alone?

2336
02:32:02,180 --> 02:32:03,299
No offense intended.

2337
02:32:05,329 --> 02:32:07,809
Ain't no pleasing some folk.

2338
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
The telltale game's choice.

2339
02:32:12,479 --> 02:32:22,159
That's too many.

2340
02:32:34,180 --> 02:32:36,750
Where'd my friend go?

2341
02:32:40,899 --> 02:32:42,819
Where's Lenny?

2342
02:32:43,840 --> 02:32:45,120
Tommy, where's Lenny?

2343
02:32:48,530 --> 02:32:50,209
Jen, you know where my friend is?

2344
02:32:54,780 --> 02:33:00,899
All right.

2345
02:33:00,899 --> 02:33:07,700
He's not back here.

2346
02:33:15,739 --> 02:33:16,459
Hey, whoa.

2347
02:33:16,459 --> 02:33:17,739
Hey, are you serious, buddy?

2348
02:33:18,620 --> 02:33:20,829
You're lucky I don't have control right now.

2349
02:33:20,829 --> 02:33:23,069
Otherwise, I would drive a horse in here and run you over.

2350
02:33:23,790 --> 02:33:35,379
Lenny.

2351
02:33:35,940 --> 02:33:39,229
Okay.

2352
02:33:39,870 --> 02:33:42,459
I've got my wits about me again.

2353
02:33:48,510 --> 02:33:48,829
What?

2354
02:33:48,829 --> 02:33:51,950
I don't understand.

2355
02:33:54,899 --> 02:33:56,020
Why did I end up back here?

2356
02:34:03,329 --> 02:34:04,610
Power of teleportation.

2357
02:34:04,610 --> 02:34:05,010
Wait.

2358
02:34:05,010 --> 02:34:05,489
Why?

2359
02:34:05,489 --> 02:34:05,729
What?

2360
02:34:06,690 --> 02:34:11,870
Did I get Luigi'd?

2361
02:34:13,389 --> 02:34:14,670
I actually got Luigi'd, I think.

2362
02:34:14,670 --> 02:34:15,229
That's what happened.

2363
02:34:29,170 --> 02:34:29,709
No.

2364
02:34:29,709 --> 02:34:30,510
Did I lose him again?

2365
02:34:32,129 --> 02:34:33,010
Oh, my God.

2366
02:34:34,959 --> 02:34:35,440
Oh, shit.

2367
02:34:44,430 --> 02:34:45,549
Go down the stairs.

2368
02:35:16,299 --> 02:35:17,579
What is happening?

2369
02:35:17,579 --> 02:35:19,020
Whoa, don't look at the dick.

2370
02:35:19,020 --> 02:35:19,500
Don't look.

2371
02:35:19,500 --> 02:35:19,819
Okay.

2372
02:35:23,709 --> 02:35:25,389
I'm in first person mode.

2373
02:35:26,030 --> 02:35:26,670
Oh, boy.

2374
02:35:29,120 --> 02:35:30,239
Find him in the saloon.

2375
02:35:30,239 --> 02:35:30,399
All right.

2376
02:35:30,399 --> 02:35:31,680
We're having like a great time.

2377
02:35:48,290 --> 02:35:49,409
Are they all Lenny?

2378
02:35:52,540 --> 02:35:52,780
What?

2379
02:35:55,120 --> 02:36:12,260
Turg.

2380
02:36:12,260 --> 02:36:13,219
Who's Turg?

2381
02:36:15,520 --> 02:36:16,559
Turg.

2382
02:36:16,559 --> 02:36:24,500
Can I sprint?

2383
02:36:35,020 --> 02:36:36,379
Can we fight each other?

2384
02:36:36,379 --> 02:36:37,739
It was going to be a slap contest.

2385
02:36:38,700 --> 02:36:44,819
Oh, this is so stupid.

2386
02:36:44,819 --> 02:36:45,139
I love it.

2387
02:36:52,379 --> 02:36:53,579
Oh, we got tankards now.

2388
02:36:56,299 --> 02:36:57,260
It's gone?

2389
02:36:57,260 --> 02:37:05,739
I'm just dropping the guy.

2390
02:37:17,500 --> 02:37:18,540
Why am I doing this?

2391
02:37:19,180 --> 02:37:29,540
There are pigs in this game.

2392
02:37:43,229 --> 02:37:44,930
Oh, that's not good.

2393
02:37:44,930 --> 02:37:45,809
Is this the law?

2394
02:37:46,850 --> 02:37:50,559
I have control.

2395
02:37:51,120 --> 02:37:52,239
I have control.

2396
02:37:52,239 --> 02:37:53,120
How do I?

2397
02:37:53,120 --> 02:37:53,680
Can I jump?

2398
02:38:03,309 --> 02:38:03,950
Got it.

2399
02:38:03,950 --> 02:38:04,989
It was blurry, but I got it.

2400
02:38:05,709 --> 02:38:17,120
Is that it?

2401
02:38:17,120 --> 02:38:18,159
Do I get to wake up now?

2402
02:38:18,879 --> 02:38:33,500
Ooh, weather change.

2403
02:38:34,139 --> 02:38:35,840
It's raining now.

2404
02:38:35,840 --> 02:38:41,120
You missed a sex scene.

2405
02:38:41,120 --> 02:38:42,639
Good job not getting banned.

2406
02:38:47,649 --> 02:38:50,129
Oh, that's all right.

2407
02:38:50,690 --> 02:38:54,450
I did lose the hat though, didn't I?

2408
02:38:58,340 --> 02:38:59,809
Do I have to buy another hat

2409
02:38:59,809 --> 02:39:01,569
or do I actually get to put it back on somehow?

2410
02:39:05,149 --> 02:39:05,950
I need to eat something.

2411
02:39:06,590 --> 02:39:12,110
Jesus.

2412
02:39:12,829 --> 02:39:19,379
Okay, I need to eat.

2413
02:39:20,020 --> 02:39:22,750
Now, let's see the details.

2414
02:39:22,750 --> 02:39:23,709
Did I do this one all right?

2415
02:39:24,350 --> 02:39:25,440
I think I missed it.

2416
02:39:26,079 --> 02:39:27,950
I need to eat.

2417
02:39:28,670 --> 02:39:29,229
What do we got?

2418
02:39:30,190 --> 02:39:32,670
I need canned sweet corn.

2419
02:39:38,299 --> 02:39:39,420
Hold triangle at rest.

2420
02:39:43,489 --> 02:39:44,850
Set up camp craft.

2421
02:39:47,440 --> 02:39:50,959
Show coffee requires a campfire.

2422
02:39:50,959 --> 02:39:51,440
Okay, hold on.

2423
02:39:51,440 --> 02:39:53,200
Let me set up campfire.

2424
02:39:53,920 --> 02:39:55,540
Do I need materials for this?

2425
02:40:07,680 --> 02:40:12,260
Craft and cook requires a percolator.

2426
02:40:12,819 --> 02:40:13,940
You don't have enough ingredients.

2427
02:40:14,979 --> 02:40:20,020
Am I slowly putting my face in the fire?

2428
02:40:20,020 --> 02:40:20,899
I can't make anything.

2429
02:40:24,059 --> 02:40:25,100
I can make health cure.

2430
02:40:25,739 --> 02:40:27,420
I can craft seven of these.

2431
02:40:27,420 --> 02:40:31,260
Potent health cure fully restores health

2432
02:40:31,260 --> 02:40:33,420
and fortifies moderately.

2433
02:40:33,420 --> 02:40:33,659
Okay.

2434
02:40:34,459 --> 02:40:36,979
Well, snake oil is the...

2435
02:40:36,979 --> 02:40:38,579
Fully restores deadeye and fortifies...

2436
02:40:38,579 --> 02:40:39,379
I'll get a bunch of these.

2437
02:40:45,250 --> 02:40:47,090
Can I fuck this up or do I just hit X?

2438
02:40:49,440 --> 02:40:49,840
Stow it.

2439
02:40:50,559 --> 02:40:56,739
Make another one.

2440
02:41:03,870 --> 02:41:05,069
It's idiot proof.

2441
02:41:05,950 --> 02:41:08,590
Hey, watch it.

2442
02:41:10,459 --> 02:41:12,059
Hey, watch it.

2443
02:41:22,299 --> 02:41:23,260
How's my health right now?

2444
02:41:23,819 --> 02:41:25,489
I guess it's...

2445
02:41:25,489 --> 02:41:26,129
I'm gonna use it.

2446
02:41:27,010 --> 02:41:27,569
Just drink it.

2447
02:41:28,209 --> 02:41:31,899
All right, I'll make one more.

2448
02:41:34,239 --> 02:41:34,959
Nice gameplay.

2449
02:41:35,600 --> 02:41:36,079
Thanks, dude.

2450
02:41:38,750 --> 02:41:39,469
This is the game.

2451
02:41:45,100 --> 02:41:48,379
Excuse me, elite red dead streamer coming through.

2452
02:41:48,379 --> 02:41:49,420
When did I ever say that?

2453
02:41:50,299 --> 02:41:55,520
I need tobacco.

2454
02:41:55,520 --> 02:41:56,000
I'll make it.

2455
02:41:56,719 --> 02:42:07,440
I guess I could just fortify it all, right?

2456
02:42:08,079 --> 02:42:16,190
Would you say this game is good or worth buying?

2457
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:21,360
Yeah, I would probably say so.

2458
02:42:22,079 --> 02:42:24,479
Because I feel like I haven't even scratched the surface.

2459
02:42:34,450 --> 02:42:38,049
I feel like I've gotten maybe like 1.8% through the game.

2460
02:42:38,770 --> 02:42:45,200
What about...

2461
02:42:45,200 --> 02:42:48,739
I need to fortify stamina.

2462
02:42:49,459 --> 02:42:52,579
Potent bitters.

2463
02:42:52,579 --> 02:42:54,020
So I need a burdock root.

2464
02:42:54,659 --> 02:42:59,819
All right, well, whatever.

2465
02:43:00,379 --> 02:43:01,100
I'm just gonna sleep.

2466
02:43:01,819 --> 02:43:05,180
Well, I just picked 20 hours of sleep.

2467
02:43:05,899 --> 02:43:13,020
PC version.

2468
02:43:13,020 --> 02:43:16,700
Yeah, I wouldn't hold your breath on a PC version anytime soon.

2469
02:43:16,700 --> 02:43:18,219
First one never came out on PC.

2470
02:43:20,780 --> 02:43:22,579
When you gain or lose weight,

2471
02:43:22,579 --> 02:43:24,579
up or down will be shown in your health form.

2472
02:43:25,379 --> 02:43:28,319
It's a tear cap down.

2473
02:43:28,319 --> 02:43:35,729
All right.

2474
02:43:38,239 --> 02:43:40,079
So, where's my horse?

2475
02:43:42,799 --> 02:43:44,670
Is this thunder and lightning?

2476
02:43:45,629 --> 02:43:52,670
When am I gonna play with Ster?

2477
02:43:53,870 --> 02:43:58,059
Ster and I are gonna play Lethal League eventually here.

2478
02:43:59,969 --> 02:44:01,969
We've had no drop frames at all in about three hours.

2479
02:44:04,750 --> 02:44:08,190
So the reason why, you know, I don't want to be like,

2480
02:44:08,190 --> 02:44:11,149
oh, hey, man, ready to like stream Lethal League?

2481
02:44:11,149 --> 02:44:12,670
It's gonna be so much fun.

2482
02:44:12,670 --> 02:44:13,469
Hope you're ready.

2483
02:44:14,110 --> 02:44:15,629
And then the internet turns off in 20 minutes

2484
02:44:15,629 --> 02:44:16,989
and it's just like, okay, well, that was a waste of time.

2485
02:44:18,030 --> 02:44:25,709
What's going on here?

2486
02:44:30,940 --> 02:44:31,500
Riding down.

2487
02:44:32,139 --> 02:44:33,100
Slipped on a rock today.

2488
02:44:33,899 --> 02:44:34,700
Moss is slippery.

2489
02:44:34,700 --> 02:44:35,579
Be careful.

2490
02:44:35,579 --> 02:44:36,139
Back hurts.

2491
02:44:50,559 --> 02:44:52,180
Throwing knives.

2492
02:44:55,379 --> 02:45:11,059
You didn't know I was up here.

2493
02:45:11,860 --> 02:45:12,909
Like, let's be honest.

2494
02:45:13,549 --> 02:45:30,590
It's fucking raining right now.

2495
02:45:30,590 --> 02:45:40,590
Hey, I don't know if he's a reliable way for me to get down here.

2496
02:45:40,590 --> 02:45:47,409
You have to go all the way around.

2497
02:45:47,409 --> 02:45:48,290
I'm stuck here.

2498
02:45:49,170 --> 02:45:58,319
Right here is okay.

2499
02:45:58,959 --> 02:46:00,399
I should be able to slide down this, right?

2500
02:46:01,280 --> 02:46:02,219
It's not that far.

2501
02:46:02,219 --> 02:46:02,940
That's like two feet.

2502
02:46:03,739 --> 02:46:09,950
At least try and mitigate the damage, man.

2503
02:46:10,909 --> 02:46:14,620
Okay, where's my horse down here?

2504
02:46:15,180 --> 02:46:23,979
Oh, someone was on the ground there.

2505
02:46:24,940 --> 02:46:28,319
Pick and examine.

2506
02:46:28,319 --> 02:46:28,959
Pick up.

2507
02:46:28,959 --> 02:46:30,559
Pick and examine what?

2508
02:46:30,559 --> 02:46:33,620
Plant.

2509
02:46:34,500 --> 02:46:38,819
My horse is in town?

2510
02:46:39,620 --> 02:46:41,149
Well, how am I supposed to?

2511
02:46:41,149 --> 02:46:42,670
I have to have to walk back to town?

2512
02:46:43,629 --> 02:46:46,670
Okay, hat.

2513
02:46:47,229 --> 02:46:49,459
Pick up hat.

2514
02:46:49,459 --> 02:46:56,510
This shit ain't even my hat.

2515
02:46:57,069 --> 02:47:04,100
This is dealing with somebody's horse.

2516
02:47:04,100 --> 02:47:06,180
All right, it's kind of what's gonna have to happen.

2517
02:47:08,899 --> 02:47:10,260
Herb, pick up.

2518
02:47:10,260 --> 02:47:14,829
Herbalist.

2519
02:47:16,739 --> 02:47:18,340
Let's take a look at the map here.

2520
02:47:20,989 --> 02:47:21,870
Reverend Swanson.

2521
02:47:24,209 --> 02:47:25,170
I can run here.

2522
02:47:26,370 --> 02:47:28,049
I'm just gonna walk to Reverend Swanson's.

2523
02:47:35,090 --> 02:47:36,049
Let me take a potion.

2524
02:47:36,770 --> 02:47:42,209
We're good.

2525
02:47:44,319 --> 02:47:44,719
This way.

2526
02:47:53,760 --> 02:47:55,360
God, it's slippery up here.

2527
02:47:55,360 --> 02:48:02,290
I unlocked an herbalist challenge.

2528
02:48:02,930 --> 02:48:08,260
It's right here, right?

2529
02:48:08,979 --> 02:48:15,579
All right, is this guy wait?

2530
02:48:16,299 --> 02:48:26,079
Hello.

2531
02:48:34,209 --> 02:48:34,930
That's not the Reverend.

2532
02:48:37,489 --> 02:48:38,129
In this room?

2533
02:48:38,129 --> 02:48:38,530
Reverend?

2534
02:48:39,170 --> 02:48:41,170
Reverend Swanson.

2535
02:48:42,639 --> 02:48:43,200
Come to meet you.

2536
02:48:43,200 --> 02:48:48,610
Mr. Borg, sir, I took your advice.

2537
02:48:48,610 --> 02:48:50,450
And your God has finally deserted you.

2538
02:48:50,450 --> 02:48:51,250
Who is not without sin?

2539
02:48:51,250 --> 02:48:53,969
I took your advice, sir.

2540
02:48:54,690 --> 02:48:58,770
I have removed myself from Morpheus's embrace.

2541
02:48:59,409 --> 02:49:01,889
No more shall I think, sir.

2542
02:49:01,889 --> 02:49:03,409
I am free.

2543
02:49:03,409 --> 02:49:04,610
I am free.

2544
02:49:05,170 --> 02:49:06,690
You don't seem free, friend.

2545
02:49:06,690 --> 02:49:07,489
You seem drunk.

2546
02:49:07,489 --> 02:49:08,450
Sit down, Reverend.

2547
02:49:08,450 --> 02:49:09,329
We ain't finished.

2548
02:49:09,329 --> 02:49:10,129
You ain't finished.

2549
02:49:10,129 --> 02:49:11,329
Look at him.

2550
02:49:11,329 --> 02:49:11,969
He's finished.

2551
02:49:11,969 --> 02:49:13,969
None of us forced liquor down his throat, friend.

2552
02:49:14,049 --> 02:49:15,409
I just want him to play.

2553
02:49:15,409 --> 02:49:17,090
Now, firstly, we ain't friends.

2554
02:49:17,729 --> 02:49:19,409
Don't make no mistake on that subject.

2555
02:49:19,409 --> 02:49:21,729
Now, secondly, he can hardly see, let alone reason.

2556
02:49:22,290 --> 02:49:24,530
Now, reasoning ain't never been one of my strong points,

2557
02:49:24,530 --> 02:49:26,450
neither, but seeing I do just fine.

2558
02:49:27,090 --> 02:49:29,409
You want to step outside or do a business here?

2559
02:49:29,409 --> 02:49:30,930
I just want him to finish the game.

2560
02:49:30,930 --> 02:49:32,930
Why can't we all just get along?

2561
02:49:33,809 --> 02:49:35,409
These are good men, Arthur.

2562
02:49:35,409 --> 02:49:36,530
They're children of God.

2563
02:49:37,090 --> 02:49:38,610
They are children of God.

2564
02:49:43,260 --> 02:49:43,739
He's down.

2565
02:49:43,739 --> 02:49:45,020
There's a pool of blood under his head.

2566
02:49:45,020 --> 02:49:45,979
Is that fair?

2567
02:49:45,979 --> 02:49:46,860
Fair?

2568
02:49:46,940 --> 02:49:47,579
Sure.

2569
02:49:48,319 --> 02:49:49,120
You want a game?

2570
02:49:52,510 --> 02:49:52,829
Sure.

2571
02:49:53,469 --> 02:49:54,510
I'll play a few hands.

2572
02:49:54,510 --> 02:49:55,149
We're playing.

2573
02:49:55,149 --> 02:49:57,229
Well, sit yourself down then.

2574
02:49:57,229 --> 02:49:57,790
Goldfish.

2575
02:49:58,670 --> 02:50:07,379
Luther, this is Marvin.

2576
02:50:10,340 --> 02:50:11,059
Okay.

2577
02:50:11,059 --> 02:50:13,620
Fortunate for you both we're being gentlemen about this.

2578
02:50:13,620 --> 02:50:16,260
Who has the best hand or bluff for the weaker one?

2579
02:50:18,850 --> 02:50:21,649
So, now you two know each other anyway.

2580
02:50:22,290 --> 02:50:24,450
Don't seem like the likeliest of friends.

2581
02:50:24,450 --> 02:50:26,209
If you don't mind me saying.

2582
02:50:26,209 --> 02:50:27,409
We go a long way back.

2583
02:50:27,409 --> 02:50:29,889
Arthur has a queen and a ten, a promising starting hand.

2584
02:50:30,690 --> 02:50:32,770
I guess it's something like that.

2585
02:50:32,770 --> 02:50:33,489
Can we play?

2586
02:50:37,489 --> 02:50:39,329
He can't be no real clergyman.

2587
02:50:39,329 --> 02:50:42,610
He committed about five cardinal sins just in that chair you're sitting in.

2588
02:50:43,250 --> 02:50:44,370
Think he used to be.

2589
02:50:45,010 --> 02:50:45,489
He's

2590
02:50:46,750 --> 02:50:47,389
community guards.

2591
02:50:47,389 --> 02:50:49,870
It comes to flop and then there comes a river.

2592
02:50:51,229 --> 02:50:52,670
Ooh, look at that.

2593
02:50:55,600 --> 02:50:57,120
Can you imagine him at the pulpit?

2594
02:50:57,120 --> 02:50:58,239
Got a pair.

2595
02:50:58,239 --> 02:50:58,719
Queen pair.

2596
02:50:58,719 --> 02:51:04,739
On the forest day, he turned water whiskey and I don't remember much after that.

2597
02:51:09,809 --> 02:51:11,969
Here comes the turn and then we got the river card.

2598
02:51:11,969 --> 02:51:14,530
He's a decent fella going through now.

2599
02:51:14,530 --> 02:51:15,090
No, no, no, no.

2600
02:51:15,090 --> 02:51:15,729
What if he has it?

2601
02:51:15,729 --> 02:51:19,329
I owe him again and you'll find yourself in a bad time too.

2602
02:51:19,889 --> 02:51:20,530
All right.

2603
02:51:20,530 --> 02:51:21,010
All right.

2604
02:51:21,010 --> 02:51:22,370
Just trying to have a little fun here.

2605
02:51:23,170 --> 02:51:24,610
It is a game after all, Mr.

2606
02:51:32,430 --> 02:51:33,629
In your own time.

2607
02:51:34,270 --> 02:51:37,389
I reckon I'll go all in.

2608
02:51:38,430 --> 02:51:45,659
Oh, I think you're going to regret that call.

2609
02:51:45,659 --> 02:51:47,579
Come on, queen, river queen.

2610
02:51:48,700 --> 02:51:49,979
Oh, I win.

2611
02:51:49,979 --> 02:51:50,540
I win it.

2612
02:51:50,540 --> 02:51:52,860
I win three dollars game over two pair.

2613
02:51:52,860 --> 02:51:53,260
I win.

2614
02:51:53,260 --> 02:51:53,760
Check.

2615
02:52:02,500 --> 02:52:04,340
It's always it always comes down to the river.

2616
02:52:13,500 --> 02:52:15,020
You've unlocked the gambler challenge.

2617
02:52:15,020 --> 02:52:16,139
Check your large for more.

2618
02:52:16,139 --> 02:52:17,659
You lucky son of a bitch.

2619
02:52:18,299 --> 02:52:19,649
I'm doing this shit again.

2620
02:52:21,700 --> 02:52:22,340
All right.

2621
02:52:22,340 --> 02:52:22,979
I'll do one more.

2622
02:52:26,930 --> 02:52:28,690
That was kind of a shitty shuffle though.

2623
02:52:28,690 --> 02:52:29,329
I will tell you.

2624
02:52:29,329 --> 02:52:29,829
Okay.

2625
02:52:32,450 --> 02:52:33,170
Look, look at the aces.

2626
02:52:33,170 --> 02:52:34,290
Look at two pocket aces.

2627
02:52:47,860 --> 02:52:48,739
Get out of here.

2628
02:52:48,739 --> 02:53:04,610
What do we got now?

2629
02:53:04,610 --> 02:53:05,809
You shuffle this time, buddy.

2630
02:53:06,450 --> 02:53:11,219
I must say you have a lot less stories than your friend did.

2631
02:53:11,219 --> 02:53:12,579
Are you lucky or not?

2632
02:53:12,579 --> 02:53:13,860
You ever considered that?

2633
02:53:14,500 --> 02:53:16,000
All right.

2634
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:16,879
Give me pocket aces.

2635
02:53:19,899 --> 02:53:20,700
Is it three, four?

2636
02:53:22,260 --> 02:53:22,979
Nine queen.

2637
02:53:22,979 --> 02:53:23,479
Okay.

2638
02:53:39,540 --> 02:53:43,840
All right.

2639
02:53:43,840 --> 02:53:44,399
What do we got?

2640
02:53:46,500 --> 02:53:47,860
Well, you should go all in.

2641
02:53:48,739 --> 02:53:50,690
What do we got?

2642
02:53:51,569 --> 02:53:52,770
Now you're talking.

2643
02:53:52,770 --> 02:53:53,010
Okay.

2644
02:53:53,010 --> 02:53:53,329
Hold on.

2645
02:53:53,329 --> 02:53:54,370
We got queen.

2646
02:53:54,370 --> 02:53:54,850
Hold on.

2647
02:53:55,649 --> 02:54:14,159
There we go.

2648
02:54:14,159 --> 02:54:15,120
That's the way it goes.

2649
02:54:15,680 --> 02:54:16,639
Excuse me.

2650
02:54:16,639 --> 02:54:17,139
Shut up.

2651
02:54:19,819 --> 02:54:21,500
I didn't lose that much money.

2652
02:54:21,500 --> 02:54:25,489
This has been quite the eventful day.

2653
02:54:26,909 --> 02:54:30,510
Just not the same without a slurring clergyman, is it?

2654
02:54:30,510 --> 02:54:31,149
Queen six.

2655
02:54:32,579 --> 02:54:33,540
No, I'm not going all in.

2656
02:54:33,540 --> 02:54:34,040
I'll call.

2657
02:54:38,020 --> 02:54:39,139
I'm gonna play slow.

2658
02:54:39,860 --> 02:54:40,819
Oh, come on.

2659
02:54:40,819 --> 02:54:42,260
This ain't kid poker.

2660
02:54:43,459 --> 02:54:44,579
We need the flop to happen here.

2661
02:54:45,379 --> 02:54:48,190
Come on.

2662
02:54:48,190 --> 02:54:48,750
Deal it out.

2663
02:54:52,739 --> 02:54:53,620
Five, four.

2664
02:54:53,620 --> 02:54:54,020
What do we got?

2665
02:54:54,020 --> 02:54:54,739
What do we got?

2666
02:54:55,540 --> 02:54:55,860
Six.

2667
02:54:57,040 --> 02:54:59,520
We got four, five, six, seven.

2668
02:54:59,520 --> 02:55:00,719
We need a seven.

2669
02:55:00,719 --> 02:55:03,069
We need seven.

2670
02:55:03,069 --> 02:55:11,299
Come on, man.

2671
02:55:11,299 --> 02:55:17,170
Some time before we all grow old.

2672
02:55:17,170 --> 02:55:18,450
Let's be brave.

2673
02:55:18,450 --> 02:55:21,100
Give us seven.

2674
02:55:21,739 --> 02:55:22,459
Okay now.

2675
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:24,719
Oh, fuck.

2676
02:55:24,719 --> 02:55:24,959
Okay.

2677
02:55:24,959 --> 02:55:25,920
Seems it's us again.

2678
02:55:26,639 --> 02:55:27,680
Close one.

2679
02:55:27,680 --> 02:55:28,659
Give us a seven.

2680
02:55:29,379 --> 02:55:29,780
Straight.

2681
02:55:30,500 --> 02:55:31,680
Do it.

2682
02:55:44,270 --> 02:55:45,229
Robbed there for real.

2683
02:55:47,280 --> 02:55:48,319
No, I'm not going to shoot him.

2684
02:55:48,879 --> 02:55:50,000
I'm going to come all the way back.

2685
02:55:56,530 --> 02:56:02,719
No, he's didn't.

2686
02:56:02,719 --> 02:56:02,879
Okay.

2687
02:56:02,879 --> 02:56:03,520
I didn't want to do that.

2688
02:56:03,520 --> 02:56:03,680
Okay.

2689
02:56:03,680 --> 02:56:04,000
Go ahead.

2690
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:04,500
Okay.

2691
02:56:05,040 --> 02:56:05,280
King.

2692
02:56:09,889 --> 02:56:11,299
Follow.

2693
02:56:11,299 --> 02:56:11,940
Good.

2694
02:56:11,940 --> 02:56:14,719
Let's start this low for now.

2695
02:56:15,680 --> 02:56:19,299
14.

2696
02:56:20,159 --> 02:56:29,340
Give us a full house.

2697
02:56:32,319 --> 02:56:33,360
Don't do this to me again.

2698
02:56:36,209 --> 02:56:36,709
King.

2699
02:56:37,569 --> 02:56:51,489
Yeah, I know.

2700
02:56:51,489 --> 02:56:52,370
Pretty pathetic.

2701
02:56:54,610 --> 02:56:55,110
Ten.

2702
02:56:59,069 --> 02:56:59,569
Ten.

2703
02:57:01,040 --> 02:57:01,540
Ten.

2704
02:57:02,700 --> 02:57:03,200
No.

2705
02:57:03,819 --> 02:57:10,030
Forgive me.

2706
02:57:10,110 --> 02:57:11,229
That's all I can afford.

2707
02:57:16,540 --> 02:57:17,040
Ten.

2708
02:57:23,250 --> 02:57:24,530
Oh, you want to check that?

2709
02:57:26,219 --> 02:57:26,719
All in.

2710
02:57:27,809 --> 02:57:28,530
What is this?

2711
02:57:29,920 --> 02:57:31,520
No, you fucking lose, buddy.

2712
02:57:31,520 --> 02:57:33,280
It's ain't what you call finishing strong.

2713
02:57:33,280 --> 02:57:34,719
Yes, yes, yes.

2714
02:57:34,719 --> 02:57:35,360
Got the ten.

2715
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:37,440
Not much I can do about that.

2716
02:57:38,079 --> 02:57:38,579
Okay.

2717
02:57:39,360 --> 02:57:41,680
So we're back in the game now.

2718
02:57:45,520 --> 02:57:46,020
See?

2719
02:57:46,319 --> 02:57:47,659
What do I got for money?

2720
02:57:47,659 --> 02:57:48,540
What do they come in here with?

2721
02:57:48,540 --> 02:57:49,979
Are you kidding me?

2722
02:57:49,979 --> 02:57:51,420
I just got to win two more hands, right?

2723
02:57:52,219 --> 02:57:53,579
Now I'm just going to play it safe

2724
02:57:53,579 --> 02:57:54,700
and I'm going to just win two hands

2725
02:57:54,700 --> 02:57:55,420
and get the achievement.

2726
02:57:58,030 --> 02:58:00,190
The people we've met at this table.

2727
02:58:00,190 --> 02:58:01,549
Can you win without a straight?

2728
02:58:01,549 --> 02:58:03,389
I hope your friend's still breathing.

2729
02:58:03,389 --> 02:58:04,510
He's very quiet.

2730
02:58:04,510 --> 02:58:05,389
You can win with a pair

2731
02:58:05,950 --> 02:58:06,909
if nobody has anything.

2732
02:58:09,010 --> 02:58:10,690
Two ten is not...

2733
02:58:10,690 --> 02:58:11,190
Yup.

2734
02:58:12,690 --> 02:58:13,809
I mean, they could get like a pair.

2735
02:58:13,809 --> 02:58:14,770
I'd give it two pair though.

2736
02:58:17,600 --> 02:58:19,200
Not just a little wager.

2737
02:58:19,920 --> 02:58:20,420
Okay.

2738
02:58:31,170 --> 02:58:33,170
Well, if somebody has a six

2739
02:58:33,170 --> 02:58:34,770
then it's just unfolding here.

2740
02:58:36,270 --> 02:58:37,069
That's too dangerous.

2741
02:58:40,079 --> 02:58:40,579
Right?

2742
02:58:40,579 --> 02:58:41,760
This is just...

2743
02:58:41,760 --> 02:58:42,559
Yeah, this is it.

2744
02:58:42,559 --> 02:58:43,059
Come on.

2745
02:58:44,260 --> 02:58:46,819
Jesus, you play like my grandmother.

2746
02:58:46,819 --> 02:58:47,940
When do you guys get a fucking six

2747
02:58:47,940 --> 02:58:48,500
as the game's over?

2748
02:58:51,059 --> 02:58:52,020
Okay, whatever.

2749
02:58:52,020 --> 02:58:53,219
That was two pair.

2750
02:58:53,219 --> 02:58:54,020
That was two pair

2751
02:58:54,020 --> 02:58:55,219
and I shouldn't have fold.

2752
02:58:55,219 --> 02:58:56,659
But if somebody has a six, we'll see.

2753
02:58:57,700 --> 02:58:58,579
That was two pair.

2754
02:58:59,299 --> 02:59:00,229
What do you got?

2755
02:59:03,489 --> 02:59:05,159
Check.

2756
02:59:05,159 --> 02:59:05,799
Can't check.

2757
02:59:06,600 --> 02:59:07,399
I thought I was going to...

2758
02:59:08,200 --> 02:59:09,959
Sorry to do this, fellas.

2759
02:59:09,959 --> 02:59:10,680
He got a six.

2760
02:59:10,680 --> 02:59:11,319
See?

2761
02:59:11,319 --> 02:59:12,680
I would have fucking lost.

2762
02:59:12,680 --> 02:59:14,280
I folded at the right time.

2763
02:59:14,280 --> 02:59:15,799
It was the correct play.

2764
02:59:15,799 --> 02:59:17,239
If you were sitting at the poker table

2765
02:59:17,239 --> 02:59:18,520
you would have had to do the same thing.

2766
02:59:19,399 --> 02:59:23,909
Okay.

2767
02:59:25,510 --> 02:59:29,270
Guys, I've made like 10 grand playing poker.

2768
02:59:30,069 --> 02:59:32,229
Now granted I've also lost 40 grand.

2769
02:59:32,790 --> 02:59:34,870
But I've won 10 grand before.

2770
02:59:43,600 --> 02:59:44,719
What do we got?

2771
02:59:44,719 --> 02:59:45,440
Clean three.

2772
02:59:46,239 --> 02:59:47,360
Well, I just need to put a couple...

2773
02:59:47,360 --> 02:59:47,860
Come on.

2774
02:59:48,680 --> 02:59:49,000
All right.

2775
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:49,719
Well, that's fine.

2776
02:59:50,440 --> 02:59:52,100
That's like...

2777
02:59:52,100 --> 02:59:53,299
Let's fuck them up a little bit here.

2778
02:59:53,299 --> 02:59:54,100
Let's break them up.

2779
02:59:57,639 --> 03:00:01,879
Give me...

2780
03:00:01,879 --> 03:00:02,760
Give me a two pair here.

2781
03:00:06,739 --> 03:00:07,379
There's the three.

2782
03:00:08,180 --> 03:00:09,829
That's a pair right there.

2783
03:00:10,469 --> 03:00:14,420
Just need a queen.

2784
03:00:15,059 --> 03:00:16,149
Oh, and another three.

2785
03:00:18,209 --> 03:00:19,329
That ain't too exciting.

2786
03:00:20,420 --> 03:00:21,219
Good.

2787
03:00:21,219 --> 03:00:22,659
I'll call it.

2788
03:00:22,659 --> 03:00:23,459
Just give me a queen or a three.

2789
03:00:23,459 --> 03:00:23,959
Come on.

2790
03:00:24,340 --> 03:00:25,139
Give me three of a kind.

2791
03:00:25,700 --> 03:00:32,159
I don't think I'm going to win.

2792
03:00:32,159 --> 03:00:33,120
This is a pair of threes.

2793
03:00:39,110 --> 03:00:39,989
And another check.

2794
03:00:40,629 --> 03:00:41,829
Why don't that surprise me?

2795
03:00:42,549 --> 03:00:43,049
Fuck.

2796
03:00:46,319 --> 03:00:47,840
Come on.

2797
03:00:47,840 --> 03:00:48,799
River's going to be like a three.

2798
03:00:48,799 --> 03:00:49,920
River's going to be a queen or a three.

2799
03:00:50,959 --> 03:00:52,709
He doesn't have his three.

2800
03:00:53,750 --> 03:00:54,309
Oh, fuck.

2801
03:00:54,309 --> 03:00:55,270
Now maybe he does.

2802
03:00:57,270 --> 03:01:01,159
I could win this with a pair.

2803
03:01:01,159 --> 03:01:01,479
Screw it.

2804
03:01:01,479 --> 03:01:02,120
With three.

2805
03:01:03,079 --> 03:01:03,719
He's bluffing.

2806
03:01:03,719 --> 03:01:04,920
This is bullshit.

2807
03:01:04,920 --> 03:01:05,959
Eighty-four cents.

2808
03:01:12,840 --> 03:01:13,399
Ace high.

2809
03:01:15,809 --> 03:01:16,610
Pair of threes.

2810
03:01:16,610 --> 03:01:17,489
Pair of sevens.

2811
03:01:17,489 --> 03:01:18,209
God damn it.

2812
03:01:22,690 --> 03:01:23,250
I would have won.

2813
03:01:23,250 --> 03:01:24,290
I would have won.

2814
03:01:24,290 --> 03:01:25,010
That would have been it.

2815
03:01:32,520 --> 03:01:33,159
I just got to...

2816
03:01:33,159 --> 03:01:33,799
Oh, look.

2817
03:01:33,799 --> 03:01:34,520
I can come back.

2818
03:01:34,520 --> 03:01:35,239
I can come back.

2819
03:01:35,239 --> 03:01:36,120
Just give me a few more minutes.

2820
03:01:36,120 --> 03:01:37,719
Just give me like another hour or two.

2821
03:01:37,719 --> 03:01:38,360
I can come back.

2822
03:01:44,979 --> 03:01:45,940
I'm just going to run to the ATM.

2823
03:01:45,940 --> 03:01:46,500
I'll be back in like...

2824
03:01:46,500 --> 03:01:47,540
I'm just going to get like another $400.

2825
03:01:48,420 --> 03:01:52,280
Queen six.

2826
03:01:52,280 --> 03:01:53,639
Why do I have a queen every time?

2827
03:01:53,639 --> 03:01:54,280
Is this rigged?

2828
03:01:55,079 --> 03:01:57,139
Seriously.

2829
03:01:57,139 --> 03:01:57,620
Is this rigged?

2830
03:01:57,620 --> 03:01:59,780
Do I have a queen fucking every hand?

2831
03:02:04,440 --> 03:02:11,129
Flip him.

2832
03:02:31,649 --> 03:02:32,149
Damn it.

2833
03:02:37,079 --> 03:02:38,360
I'm trying to fluff him up.

2834
03:02:40,600 --> 03:02:41,159
Come on.

2835
03:02:42,360 --> 03:02:42,860
No.

2836
03:02:48,899 --> 03:02:50,180
How do I go to the ATM?

2837
03:02:52,239 --> 03:02:54,159
This is getting too rich for me.

2838
03:02:54,159 --> 03:02:54,879
Sit down.

2839
03:02:56,079 --> 03:02:56,559
I'll be right back.

2840
03:02:56,559 --> 03:02:58,079
I'm just going to go to my horse.

2841
03:02:58,079 --> 03:02:59,280
I'm going to get my debit card.

2842
03:02:59,280 --> 03:03:00,079
Come on, Rip.

2843
03:03:00,079 --> 03:03:03,430
Where'd he go?

2844
03:03:03,430 --> 03:03:03,930
Who?

2845
03:03:08,020 --> 03:03:09,139
Excuse me, gentlemen.

2846
03:03:12,260 --> 03:03:14,180
The tutorial AI never holds.

2847
03:03:15,700 --> 03:03:22,180
Who's the stranger?

2848
03:03:22,739 --> 03:03:25,280
Excuse me.

2849
03:03:25,280 --> 03:03:26,000
I'm sorry.

2850
03:03:26,000 --> 03:03:28,879
You see a drunken idiot priest wandering about?

2851
03:03:35,120 --> 03:03:36,159
It wasn't done.

2852
03:03:36,159 --> 03:03:37,280
It wasn't done.

2853
03:03:37,280 --> 03:03:37,780
Hey.

2854
03:03:38,479 --> 03:03:46,260
I'm just screaming for him.

2855
03:03:51,729 --> 03:03:53,090
God damn it.

2856
03:03:53,090 --> 03:03:54,450
I'm not trying to kill anybody.

2857
03:03:56,069 --> 03:03:57,110
Jesus Christ.

2858
03:04:00,159 --> 03:04:00,659
What?

2859
03:04:06,610 --> 03:04:07,110
Find him.

2860
03:04:11,520 --> 03:04:12,079
Who is this?

2861
03:04:20,719 --> 03:04:21,280
Who?

2862
03:04:21,280 --> 03:04:40,709
He's still alive.

2863
03:05:02,229 --> 03:05:03,270
He's still alive.

2864
03:05:04,680 --> 03:05:07,239
This guy is a fucking super human.

2865
03:05:23,120 --> 03:05:23,620
Okay.

2866
03:05:24,899 --> 03:05:25,940
Oh, no, no, no, no.

2867
03:05:35,299 --> 03:05:36,659
No, get the sheep out of the way.

2868
03:05:37,379 --> 03:05:42,440
Come here.

2869
03:05:42,440 --> 03:05:42,680
Come here.

2870
03:05:42,680 --> 03:05:43,180
Come here.

2871
03:05:43,639 --> 03:05:58,340
Live spirit.

2872
03:05:59,299 --> 03:06:05,040
Is he going to the train?

2873
03:06:11,649 --> 03:06:12,530
What is he doing?

2874
03:06:14,659 --> 03:06:15,620
I can't jump that high.

2875
03:06:19,920 --> 03:06:21,040
What the fuck is he doing?

2876
03:06:39,719 --> 03:06:40,440
The train's not coming.

2877
03:06:40,440 --> 03:06:40,940
We're fine.

2878
03:06:47,360 --> 03:06:47,600
All right.

2879
03:06:47,600 --> 03:06:48,100
Come here.

2880
03:06:53,680 --> 03:06:54,639
Oh, the train's right there.

2881
03:07:02,520 --> 03:07:03,239
All right, got him.

2882
03:07:03,239 --> 03:07:03,739
Come on.

2883
03:07:12,530 --> 03:07:13,729
What the hell did you do, man?

2884
03:07:21,989 --> 03:07:23,750
That was just the heavy from TF2.

2885
03:07:23,750 --> 03:07:27,639
What the hell is wrong with you throwing me bridge like that?

2886
03:07:27,639 --> 03:07:30,600
There was a goddamn train, you crazy bastard.

2887
03:07:32,040 --> 03:07:35,010
Have I been bad again, Mr. Morgan?

2888
03:07:36,049 --> 03:07:37,010
I'm sorry.

2889
03:07:39,569 --> 03:07:42,020
We're just different.

2890
03:07:49,520 --> 03:07:52,000
Good on you for not doing the cheap YouTuber joke.

2891
03:07:52,000 --> 03:07:52,500
Home.

2892
03:07:53,040 --> 03:07:53,540
Yeah.

2893
03:07:54,479 --> 03:07:55,680
Yeah, I mean, come on.

2894
03:07:56,799 --> 03:07:59,120
I've done enough stupid shit the last three hours.

2895
03:07:59,120 --> 03:07:59,440
Margaret.

2896
03:07:59,440 --> 03:08:00,159
Who's Margaret?

2897
03:08:01,520 --> 03:08:14,260
Yeah, y'all thought of...

2898
03:08:22,600 --> 03:08:26,600
By the way, those of you that have very keen ears, I pressed R2.

2899
03:08:27,319 --> 03:08:35,040
Let me try.

2900
03:08:35,040 --> 03:08:35,520
Yeah, I know.

2901
03:08:39,120 --> 03:08:39,620
Yeah.

2902
03:09:04,959 --> 03:09:05,600
No, drop.

2903
03:09:09,159 --> 03:09:12,840
What a classic.

2904
03:09:12,840 --> 03:09:14,360
It's a classic one, you know?

2905
03:09:21,510 --> 03:09:22,229
One more time.

2906
03:09:22,229 --> 03:09:24,629
Dude, it's a classic funny YouTube joke.

2907
03:09:24,629 --> 03:09:25,129
Come on.

2908
03:09:25,850 --> 03:09:28,040
We fell off on the...

2909
03:09:28,040 --> 03:09:28,680
What the heck?

2910
03:09:31,079 --> 03:09:36,469
You have to do it for the YouTube joke.

2911
03:09:53,350 --> 03:09:54,389
No, I'm not doing it.

2912
03:10:00,260 --> 03:10:07,110
Told you I wasn't gonna do it.

2913
03:10:07,750 --> 03:10:14,889
Just bail on the last second.

2914
03:10:14,889 --> 03:10:16,489
No, no, we can't do that anymore.

2915
03:10:16,489 --> 03:10:18,809
There's way more funny, interesting things to do than...

2916
03:10:18,809 --> 03:10:20,170
Look, I fell off the cliff again.

2917
03:10:21,370 --> 03:10:21,870
You know?

2918
03:10:24,549 --> 03:10:33,510
Wait for the train to go through the length of the entire map and then get hit by it.

2919
03:10:34,229 --> 03:10:50,790
To do any of this.

2920
03:10:50,790 --> 03:10:51,670
Here comes another one.

2921
03:10:51,670 --> 03:10:52,629
Don't need to do this.

2922
03:10:56,700 --> 03:10:57,819
He's coming without him.

2923
03:11:05,430 --> 03:11:06,069
Hey, hey!

2924
03:11:09,750 --> 03:11:11,030
Is he out cold?

2925
03:11:11,030 --> 03:11:12,149
I think he's knocked out.

2926
03:11:13,110 --> 03:11:15,350
I think it ran over his head.

2927
03:11:17,670 --> 03:11:18,709
I think he's dead.

2928
03:11:20,600 --> 03:11:21,239
Is he dead?

2929
03:11:21,239 --> 03:11:22,840
Don't mind if I'm dead.

2930
03:11:22,840 --> 03:11:23,479
He isn't.

2931
03:11:23,479 --> 03:11:23,979
Okay.

2932
03:11:26,790 --> 03:11:27,590
He hit a horse.

2933
03:11:27,750 --> 03:11:29,030
Oh, hello, sirs.

2934
03:11:32,860 --> 03:11:34,700
Oh, he got in an accident.

2935
03:11:36,280 --> 03:11:37,719
Hello, it's a fatty!

2936
03:11:38,520 --> 03:11:48,670
Let's hitch.

2937
03:11:54,420 --> 03:11:55,139
All right, Reverend.

2938
03:11:55,780 --> 03:11:57,739
What do you think?

2939
03:11:58,760 --> 03:12:03,290
Where's it going?

2940
03:12:03,290 --> 03:12:04,090
Where are you going with him?

2941
03:12:17,979 --> 03:12:18,940
Drop off in bed.

2942
03:12:19,819 --> 03:12:23,780
I am babysitting this guy, huh?

2943
03:12:26,950 --> 03:12:27,909
Just leave him on the horse?

2944
03:12:27,909 --> 03:12:30,069
Can I put him on the horse and then put the horse in bed?

2945
03:12:35,770 --> 03:12:36,329
No.

2946
03:12:36,329 --> 03:12:37,129
Drop in fire.

2947
03:12:37,129 --> 03:12:37,850
That's not gonna happen.

2948
03:12:38,409 --> 03:12:39,129
Drop off cliff.

2949
03:12:39,129 --> 03:12:39,770
Not gonna happen.

2950
03:12:43,079 --> 03:12:47,299
You better sleep your way to salvation, my friend.

2951
03:12:48,899 --> 03:12:50,180
What happened?

2952
03:12:50,180 --> 03:12:52,340
Just the usual.

2953
03:12:52,340 --> 03:12:53,620
Poor bastard.

2954
03:12:53,620 --> 03:12:54,739
Exactly.

2955
03:12:54,739 --> 03:12:56,500
Well, thank you, Mr. Morgan.

2956
03:12:56,500 --> 03:12:58,180
I'll keep an eye on him.

2957
03:12:58,819 --> 03:13:00,100
Comedy license revoked.

2958
03:13:00,100 --> 03:13:00,579
He was lucky this time.

2959
03:13:01,780 --> 03:13:02,340
Real lucky.

2960
03:13:08,680 --> 03:13:09,479
All right.

2961
03:13:09,479 --> 03:13:11,270
Who is not without sin completed?

2962
03:13:13,719 --> 03:13:14,219
Donation.

2963
03:13:14,760 --> 03:13:16,870
Let's get it to 100 bucks.

2964
03:13:17,510 --> 03:13:50,280
A companion activity is available in the camp.

2965
03:13:50,280 --> 03:13:51,559
Talk to companions marked on your map.

2966
03:13:56,469 --> 03:13:57,190
Where?

2967
03:13:57,190 --> 03:13:58,229
Companion activity?

2968
03:13:58,790 --> 03:14:01,370
It's now marked on the map.

2969
03:14:01,370 --> 03:14:01,610
What?

2970
03:14:01,610 --> 03:14:02,329
Which one opened up?

2971
03:14:10,149 --> 03:14:11,750
Five finger fillet with Lenny.

2972
03:14:13,700 --> 03:14:14,579
Not this shit again.

2973
03:14:23,530 --> 03:14:25,610
I couldn't do this before because it was an Xbox controller, though.

2974
03:14:29,959 --> 03:14:30,360
Remember?

2975
03:14:31,739 --> 03:14:32,540
I should be fine.

2976
03:14:35,940 --> 03:14:36,440
Lenny?

2977
03:14:36,899 --> 03:14:37,620
Hey, Arthur.

2978
03:14:37,620 --> 03:14:39,700
That knife's sharp enough, ain't it?

2979
03:14:39,700 --> 03:14:40,659
Depends.

2980
03:14:40,659 --> 03:14:41,299
Why?

2981
03:14:41,299 --> 03:14:42,100
You feel lucky?

2982
03:14:42,659 --> 03:14:43,139
Do you?

2983
03:14:43,860 --> 03:14:44,899
Before me?

2984
03:14:44,899 --> 03:14:47,459
At least six generations were born and changed.

2985
03:14:47,459 --> 03:14:48,739
And for the last three years,

2986
03:14:48,739 --> 03:14:52,659
I've been running from every lawman and bounty hunter west of the Lanahassee River.

2987
03:14:53,219 --> 03:14:55,219
So yeah, I feel lucky.

2988
03:14:55,219 --> 03:14:56,979
I'm the living embodiment of luck.

2989
03:14:56,979 --> 03:14:58,899
That is one way of seeing things.

2990
03:14:58,899 --> 03:15:00,260
But I'm also skill.

2991
03:15:00,899 --> 03:15:01,700
And in this game,

2992
03:15:01,700 --> 03:15:02,260
I think I'll be all right here.

2993
03:15:02,260 --> 03:15:05,299
You've got to have luck and skill.

2994
03:15:05,299 --> 03:15:06,819
And stupidity.

2995
03:15:06,819 --> 03:15:08,180
The outlaw's trinity.

2996
03:15:08,819 --> 03:15:11,219
Luck, skill, and just a dose of stupidity.

2997
03:15:11,219 --> 03:15:11,940
Come on.

2998
03:15:11,940 --> 03:15:14,819
You ain't too loyal and too sly just yet.

2999
03:15:14,819 --> 03:15:15,540
After you.

3000
03:15:15,540 --> 03:15:16,260
As you wish.

3001
03:15:16,979 --> 03:15:21,459
You know, we should head back up that mountain sometime and make Jenny a proper grade.

3002
03:15:21,459 --> 03:15:22,180
Okay, who's turning?

3003
03:15:22,180 --> 03:15:22,680
So nice.

3004
03:15:23,540 --> 03:15:24,020
Don't worry.

3005
03:15:24,020 --> 03:15:25,059
Does this work just like the other one?

3006
03:15:25,059 --> 03:15:26,659
I'll send a wire to the doctor for you.

3007
03:15:26,659 --> 03:15:27,620
Oh, he just cut his hand.

3008
03:15:35,000 --> 03:15:36,440
Oh, he's setting the time I have to beat.

3009
03:15:37,159 --> 03:15:43,159
Here goes.

3010
03:15:53,719 --> 03:15:55,829
Got it.

3011
03:15:55,829 --> 03:15:56,950
Keep it loose.

3012
03:15:56,950 --> 03:16:01,000
What are the buttons here?

3013
03:16:01,000 --> 03:16:02,760
Okay, it's X triangle, so it's triangle.

3014
03:16:03,479 --> 03:16:04,360
So it's X triangle.

3015
03:16:04,360 --> 03:16:04,920
X triangle.

3016
03:16:04,920 --> 03:16:06,280
I'll do it like in five seconds.

3017
03:16:06,920 --> 03:16:12,059
Check it out.

3018
03:16:12,059 --> 03:16:12,559
Ready?

3019
03:16:17,750 --> 03:16:19,829
Get the hell out of here.

3020
03:16:19,829 --> 03:16:25,000
What do we got now?

3021
03:16:25,639 --> 03:16:26,920
So this is X square, X...

3022
03:16:26,920 --> 03:16:29,319
Okay, just X square, X square, X square, X square, X square.

3023
03:16:34,260 --> 03:16:35,780
No other variables here.

3024
03:16:41,110 --> 03:16:41,829
Record time here.

3025
03:16:41,829 --> 03:16:42,309
Watch this.

3026
03:17:02,420 --> 03:17:03,379
Now we go on round two.

3027
03:17:05,750 --> 03:17:06,469
So this is...

3028
03:17:06,469 --> 03:17:10,469
Okay, so this is circle, circle, circle, square, square.

3029
03:17:18,340 --> 03:17:25,930
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

3030
03:17:25,930 --> 03:17:27,049
This is so boring.

3031
03:17:27,930 --> 03:17:32,940
So this is square, square, square, triangle, triangle.

3032
03:17:44,569 --> 03:17:48,790
Damn it.

3033
03:17:48,790 --> 03:17:49,350
I gotta do it again.

3034
03:17:49,350 --> 03:17:49,989
I gotta do it again.

3035
03:17:51,319 --> 03:18:03,989
Oh, I'm freaking out.

3036
03:18:03,989 --> 03:18:06,540
Another one.

3037
03:18:06,540 --> 03:18:07,420
Try this in real life.

3038
03:18:09,559 --> 03:18:10,760
Okay, I gotta slow down on this one.

3039
03:18:10,760 --> 03:18:15,079
This is circle, circle, square, triangle, circle.

3040
03:18:15,079 --> 03:18:16,680
Let's get paid attention.

3041
03:18:16,680 --> 03:18:18,200
It's gonna be before a second.

3042
03:18:27,370 --> 03:18:36,649
Triangle, circle, square, circle, triangle.

3043
03:18:36,649 --> 03:18:39,690
Triangles, circles, square, triangle, circle, square, circle, triangle.

3044
03:18:39,690 --> 03:18:40,010
What was it?

3045
03:18:47,000 --> 03:18:48,889
Okay, what's this next one?

3046
03:18:53,709 --> 03:18:54,389
Let me see.

3047
03:18:55,530 --> 03:19:00,329
Square, triangle, circle, triangle, square, square, triangle, square.

3048
03:19:00,329 --> 03:19:07,610
square triangle circle triangle square square triangle circle triangle square

3130
03:36:32,819 --> 03:36:38,200
so like this i don't want this horse to die but i want to test out of speed zero to 60

3131
03:36:38,200 --> 03:36:48,659
run up in the mountains east of cumberland this is quick i just hope i can remember how to get there

3132
03:36:49,379 --> 03:36:56,379
back into the mountains i sure didn't figure on that but this time we're doing the chasing i

3133
03:36:56,379 --> 03:37:03,899
fucking hate the tail why so how are things with you what's wrong with it i mean it looks

3134
03:37:03,979 --> 03:37:05,979
kind of like a scorpion tail but that's fine

3135
03:37:17,979 --> 03:37:23,979
the tail is fine it just looks like there's a snake up its ass

3136
03:37:37,059 --> 03:37:38,500
if it dies i lose it forever

3137
03:37:40,020 --> 03:37:42,899
well then that's very good reason for me to keep it alive

3138
03:37:48,440 --> 03:38:07,430
long hair it's the color not the braid get gold okay time to go i think we need to head right

3139
03:38:07,430 --> 03:38:22,180
up here we're gonna go up all the way up yes i remember i'm not in control anymore am i

3140
03:38:22,260 --> 03:38:38,250
moonstone pond what's what's wrong with my golden tail red hair do i prefer flathead

3141
03:38:38,250 --> 03:38:44,360
screwdrivers or phillips well depends on what the scenario is we made it let's loop around

3142
03:38:44,360 --> 03:38:56,340
the other side you can't have a favorite screwdriver depends on how big it is here

3143
03:38:56,340 --> 03:39:00,899
you know this this screwdriver is a phillips head i can't undo my table without a phillips

3144
03:39:00,899 --> 03:39:06,090
head might as well go get a flathead no i mean phillips head definitely is cooler but

3145
03:39:07,049 --> 03:39:23,989
did i do cinematic centrist streamer is scared to take a side maybe we should catch one to cook

3146
03:39:23,989 --> 03:39:30,950
sure try and shoot one you don't want to use anything too powerful on a small animal like that

3147
03:39:30,950 --> 03:39:34,229
just ruin the meat you can probably put a paint can with a flathead

3148
03:39:36,549 --> 03:39:49,780
you can probably put a paint can with a hammer as well slow down well there they all are i did

3149
03:39:49,780 --> 03:40:13,829
i thought thought we were still in a cut scene why don't they just i got one

3150
03:40:23,780 --> 03:40:27,860
not very smart rabbits i will say you are correct on that

3151
03:40:32,540 --> 03:40:41,059
yep good job all right getting late that's it we should camp here oh i thought we were

3152
03:40:41,059 --> 03:40:58,379
going home yeah that's it get us set up well i'm finished cook that rabbit then

3153
03:40:59,100 --> 03:41:04,459
they're delicious on an open fire like this just like monster hunter right to spin it

3154
03:41:05,340 --> 03:41:10,469
i ever had been in this menu it's just teaching me how to be in the menu

3155
03:41:11,739 --> 03:41:28,870
and cook six of this plain game let's go can i burn it you want something no i'm fine

3156
03:41:28,870 --> 03:41:36,200
i don't like eating this late okay what after all that so i'm gonna eat a whole rabbit

3157
03:41:36,200 --> 03:41:56,760
myself i guess i probably could do that i could probably eat a whole rabbit put this one away

3158
03:42:02,120 --> 03:42:15,420
rabbits are 30 pounds are you sure about that no they're not 30 pounds is is like a medium-sized

3159
03:42:15,420 --> 03:42:28,280
dog a rabbit is like maybe two pounds this isn't a shibu inu what do they call

3160
03:42:30,360 --> 03:42:44,649
shiba shiba inu a rabbit is how many pounds is a rabbit siri how many pounds is a rabbit

3161
03:42:44,649 --> 03:42:56,020
how much does a rabbit weigh how much does a rabbit weigh okay let's see ranging from

3162
03:42:56,020 --> 03:43:05,190
adult domestic rabbits can have a healthy weight ranging from two to eleven pounds two pounds

3163
03:43:05,190 --> 03:43:21,180
eleven pounds that's huge that's a hair that's not even a rabbit first like to find this

3164
03:43:21,180 --> 03:43:30,469
monster choose a time to sleep until sleep until morning he better be worth all this drama

3165
03:43:30,469 --> 03:43:52,409
eleven pound absolute unit rabbit five five five you ready no give me a minute coffee sure there

3166
03:43:52,409 --> 03:44:02,940
you go so what's your plan well we'll see if we can track them but we might need to lay

3167
03:44:02,940 --> 03:44:07,100
bait to draw them out i want one of those cups obviously but they all can you get one

3168
03:44:07,100 --> 03:44:11,420
of those one of those old school tin cups i'll drink out of that every day shoot from the

3169
03:44:11,500 --> 03:44:16,940
trees but i prefer to hunt on the ground more dangerous but we'll have a much better

3170
03:44:16,940 --> 03:44:22,219
chance of getting good shot in and if he bolts we can start right off after him why is my

3171
03:44:22,219 --> 03:44:28,139
author arthur santa because halloween was yesterday and now we've gone it's christmas time tie it

3172
03:44:28,139 --> 03:44:35,239
up in that rag when you're done i hope you know what you're talking about i grew up in the

3173
03:44:37,110 --> 03:44:39,350
predator bait select the potent predator bait recipe

3174
03:44:42,549 --> 03:44:50,579
that was virtually weaned on bear meat okay i think i got this done good pack up and we'll

3175
03:44:50,579 --> 03:45:08,069

years ago really i don't i imagine you still miss her every day did you two ever

3179
03:45:32,889 --> 03:45:38,090

right now or am i getting yelled at for no reason you should be hearing like don't don't

3181
03:45:43,719 --> 03:46:01,770
don't don't don't don't do a test with a gun this is a better test right when you see the

3182
03:46:01,770 --> 03:46:14,870
highlight it should go it's a half second behind it wasn't it normal at the beginning of the

3183
03:46:14,870 --> 03:46:41,909
stream the audio is playing first hold on let me try this that's weird tell me if this fixes

3184
03:46:41,909 --> 03:47:00,489
it already i wonder why that happened that's weird because it wasn't doing that in the

3185
03:47:00,489 --> 03:47:04,889
beginning i don't know why why i'm just desyncing after playing for like three or four hours it's

3186
03:47:04,889 --> 03:47:18,809
weird okay let's go now we did briefly you don't remember guess you were still young i had my

3187
03:47:18,809 --> 03:47:25,209
sound off how would you know there was a problem she understood she knew what i was

3188
03:47:25,850 --> 03:47:34,420
i've been around for a while things were looser back then truth is there's never really any

3189
03:47:34,819 --> 03:47:40,979
out the audio is at the wrong angle i gotta like tilt my audio you know that but bessie and i

3190
03:47:40,979 --> 03:47:48,840
made it work you thinking about getting out hey no of course not you can braid your horse's tail

3191
03:47:48,840 --> 03:47:53,639
yep duchess grand plans work and you can paint it gold we can make enough money to go someplace
