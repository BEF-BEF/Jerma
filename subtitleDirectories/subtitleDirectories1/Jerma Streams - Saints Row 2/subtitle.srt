1
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:36,140
That title sucks. I forgot to change the title. Hold on, one second. I'm drawing a blank.

2
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:44,840
The VOD is permanently titled this? I don't know. What should I make it? I'm drawing a blank.

3
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:58,899
Call it Saints Row Poo. That's worse than this one. I got my iced coffee. I'm ready to go.

4
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:09,510
Sorry about that. I had to take a phone call. The easiest fucking way to get out of anything.

5
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,200
What could that phone call be? Was that phone call important?

6
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,780
Was that phone call somebody you had to talk to? Immediately? You don't know. You have no idea.

7
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:37,260
No, I'm not. I'm fucking around. I've got my wasabi soy sauce. Almond here. Just in case I need a

8
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:50,329
snack. What's wrong? I'm fine. Soy sauce. I actually don't like soy sauce. Okay. Let's go over what's

9
00:01:50,329 --> 00:02:01,079
going on today. In the next couple, maybe a couple weeks. So hold on. I gotta move stuff around. I

10
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:07,980
just was not fucking prepared at all. But like I said, I'm not like all these other streamers.

11
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:13,099
Okay. It's time for the defense here. You ready for the defense? I've said it a thousand times.

12
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:20,729
So when, when, when, when all the other streamers turn their streams on, they usually have like at

13
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:27,289
least 15 to 30 minute countdown before the stream actually starts. See, I get here. I just turn it

14
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:32,490
on and fucking I'm not even ready. You know, I am the countdown. This is the countdown right now.

15
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:42,120
It's me. I am such an egomaniac and I'm so full of myself that even when I'm not supposed to have

16
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:53,819
the stream on, I'm streaming here talking to you as the waiting room. All right, we're gonna play

17
00:02:53,819 --> 00:03:01,020
Saints Row 2 today. I've never played any of the Saints Row games with a asterisk on it.

18
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:09,479
Aster and I played Saints Row 2 for like an hour or two hours or something. We got through the

19
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:15,689
character creator and then we just kind of stopped like an hour or two later. So I've never played

20
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:19,210
any of these all the way through or even halfway through or even a third of the way through.

21
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:30,389
I remember that video. Yeah, we also have a mod. I have the gentleman of the row mod installed,

22
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:40,919
which I guess fixes the whole game somehow. You're a fake fan. What do you mean?

23
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:50,550
Saints Row 2 is literally the best game ever. Okay, well, find out. I didn't even tweet this.

24
00:03:51,270 --> 00:04:04,379
Give me one second. I hope everybody had a good Thanksgiving. Did you celebrate it? I did. I made

25
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,669
a 25 pound turkey because I wanted to make sure I had leftovers for two or three months

26
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:14,870
because I freeze essentially more than two-thirds of the entire bird.

27
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:23,990
What is that sound? What's going on? Am I getting played off the stage?

28
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:35,939
What's playing? What's playing me off the stage right now? What's going on? Oh,

29
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:40,470
shit. This is DMCA music. Hold on. Why? Hold on. Why was this not playing earlier?

30
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:55,660
This was not playing earlier. I've had Saints Row 2 open for 12 straight minutes. Audio, music,

31
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:01,110
volume. Should I turn music volume to zero? That's so boring though. Well, that's not boring.

32
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:07,139
That's how I live my life. All right, let me turn my fan down. It's going pretty hard here,

33
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:13,139
but something really important to know is... I didn't even know this is coming out this soon,

34
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:21,050
I guess. Monster Rancher 1 and 2 remake is out in less than two weeks. I hope you guys understand

35
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:27,050
that whatever you followed this channel for, whether it was for... Oh, I like when he does

36
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:32,170
like the big stream stuff. That's never happening ever again. Once Monster Rancher 1 and 2 comes out,

37
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:36,089
I'm only going to play that game. I will fill that category for the rest of the time I stream.

38
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:47,000
It's a lie, by the way. I have plenty of shit planned. It's based. Yeah, I know. All right.

39
00:05:47,000 --> 00:06:00,300
No more fucking around. No more stalling. Let's go. Let me tweet. Saints Row 2. But honestly,

40
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,740
no, all jokes aside, I'm going to play that game a lot. I played it a lot when

41
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:10,379
we did the PlayStation 1 stuff, but I'm very curious how they're going to handle the CD thing.

42
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:20,970
I didn't... Did anybody know? What are they going to do? You know what I said, and unfortunately,

43
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:29,480
nobody listened to me. They have a built-in database. It should have been URLs. Somebody

44
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,800
steal that from me, please. Like, but give me 5% of all the revenue of every... of the whole project.

45
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:46,660
URLs would have been fucking hilarious, wouldn't it have? The link here.

46
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:57,819
Okay. All right. I'm ready. You're ready to sit in, like, for an hour in the character creator?

47
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:04,379
Because you know we're going to. Because part of this mod increases the body sliders by, like, 500%.

48
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:17,180
So, well, welcome to the stream. All right. I'm ready to go. Okay. Here we go. New game.

49
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:24,100
Is there a... There's probably a... I'm assuming there's probably a opening cutscene. I think there

50
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:29,899
is. All right. Hopefully this is not too loud. If it's not, let me know. If it is, then don't,

51
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:35,290
then don't tell me. Okay. Go. I'm not playing on hardcore. Why would you play, like, a GTA game

52
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:57,879
on hardcore? Oh, that was... That hurt my head. It's way too dank.

53
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,360
You know, I just found out what that was two days ago.

54
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:20,360
I know. I'll fix it in a minute.

55
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,199
Do you think it's going to kill the framerate?

56
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,360
I have the Gentleman of the Road mod, which can fix a lot of problems.

57
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,440
We can't even hear you.

58
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:51,100
Not yet. But I'm about to take the... I know my audio. I know. I'm... Okay. Every time I try to

59
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:57,610
fix my audio system, it fucks up. All right. Hold on. You understand? I always hear... I'm looking

60
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:05,690
over at my OBS right now, and I see the microphone. I see, like, the... the waveform, right? That,

61
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:12,649
right now, is bright fucking red. And if it goes any louder, it's gonna... So I don't understand how

62
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:20,500
to fix it. Everybody talks about how quiet I am, but according to my... my computer, it's fucking,

63
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:25,539
like, barely... If I talk any... If this goes any louder, it's gonna be like... It's gonna blow out

64
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:32,779
your ears. It's gonna peak. I don't get it. I don't understand why. I think it's this microphone. I

65
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:36,299
think this... this microphone is a really good mic. But I don't think it was ever designed to be

66
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:46,470
plugged in to, like, do what I'm doing. Clip that noise. Don't do that. Idiot. You idiot. Okay,

67
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:53,080
hold on. Let me turn the game down a little. This should be a bit of right there. Okay.

68
00:09:53,080 --> 00:10:00,570
So, we have to figure out... What do I want to do with this? Okay. Uh, I'm gonna try to make me.

69
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:11,350
No, not exit. Holy shit, there's a... There's a dick. No, it's not. Oh my god. Right. Right. Okay.

70
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:27,779
We're fine. Okay. Hold on. So, the sliders have been increased by about two to three hundred percent.

71
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:35,429
This is current German. Yeah. All right. Wait a minute. How come it's giving me these... Okay.

72
00:10:35,429 --> 00:10:51,740
Why the... Where's the button prompts? All right. Body shape. Okay. I feel... This is just... I feel

73
00:10:51,740 --> 00:11:00,980
like I'm in a Ninja Turtle costume. I don't know why. Why am I seeing that? I don't get it.

74
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:13,320
Why did I just say that? How much age should we have? All right. I don't want to go too overboard

75
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,039
because we have to live with this for the whole rest of the entire time I played this game.

76
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:28,100
You just made E. Honda. Should we be jacked fat? No. I can't just put all the sliders to the right.

77
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:57,750
That's so easy. Oh no. I can't. This is the back of the head? I'm just gonna make, like, a fucking

78
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:13,220
banana split head. Tyler won. I can't. Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me. What you meant to say is...

79
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,740
You didn't mean to say Tyler won. What you meant to say was one of the greatest Twitch

80
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:21,419
interactive entertainers on the platform is what you meant to say. Make sure you get it right next

81
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:39,399
time. Oh my goodness. That's the... That's not my hair. That's my head. Where's the brain? I don't

82
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:48,009
know. I don't think it exists. This is the neck? Hold on. It looks like somebody's cutting down a

83
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:56,570
tree. It's on the trunk. I don't know if I like that. I'm gonna have to change that, I think.

84
00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:05,509
All right. Should I make his head a serving platter? Like a gravy boat? Because that's

85
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:20,840
what's happening. I mean, it just was Thanksgiving. Oh my god. He's wearing a baseball bat. A baseball

86
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:27,879
hat of his own head. A baseball bat? He's wearing a baseball hat of his own head. I said that wrong,

87
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:37,690
but you know what I mean. Somebody can ride his head? How wide? Should be not that wide.

88
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:44,679
I like it like this. At least for now. I might have to go back and fix it, though.

89
00:13:49,269 --> 00:14:10,490
This is just Peter Pettigrew. He's so mad. Well, now he is. I kind of like it like this.

90
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:22,409
This is a beer. Maybe it will reduce the weight. Maybe it will reduce the fatness.

91
00:14:22,409 --> 00:14:32,659
Oh, I like that. It's scary. Big and bushy or small and scary, what do you think?

92
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:40,789
It's the guy that can survive the car crash. It is. What was that guy's name? It was... What was it?

93
00:14:41,429 --> 00:14:47,639
What was that guy's name? It was the... It was the thing they made in the CG program that could

94
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:55,220
actually survive a car crash. It had like a gram. That's right. Hold on. Yeah, I can't alt-tab this

95
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:09,899
game because it breaks. Look up gram. Car crash. I like that. I think angry is better, though.

96
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:17,299
I want to see the eyes. I don't want to lose the eyes. Real tragedy. No, I'm not saying look...

97
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:23,740
I'm not saying look up this person that... Whatever. It actually is Peter Pettigrew now.

98
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:31,460
Well, it would make sense to make that person because I'm probably going to get a bunch of

99
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:43,460
car crashes. No, I didn't say look up car crash on Google. I said look up car crash gram. It's a

100
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:59,210
very specific thing to look up. All right, that's okay. Eyes. This is important. I can't.

101
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:17,210
He looks like he could survive. Hmm. Randomize. I don't want to randomize it. He has a part in his

102
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:27,450
hair. Yeah, the part is a little bit further back on his skull. That's so weird. Okay, we'll keep

103
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:47,299
that. No, we won't. How about this? No. Really deep eyes. I have eyes like this. I kind of like it.

104
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:53,259
Not that low, though. I want to be able to see all those features. I do? Yeah, I have really deep

105
00:16:53,259 --> 00:17:03,480
set eyes. They go really far back. Yeah, my eyes are so far back set into my head that they're

106
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:09,140
kind of close to my brain. So if I kind of push in my eyes very gently, like the last episode of

107
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:18,890
SpongeBob plays, it's just like... Like weird shit happens. Like I'm pushing on like the frontal lobe

108
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:26,630
of my brain when I do it. Like, okay, I'm going to do it. Someone was just speaking French. There

109
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:30,869
was a guy just speaking French holding like a big dinner plate. He was like serving it. I don't know.

110
00:17:30,869 --> 00:17:51,180
Let me work on my guy, please. This is what you look like. Why do you... You don't think I know

111
00:17:51,180 --> 00:18:14,630
that? Oh, boy. No, I want to see the eyes. Maybe not that big. Like this. Even anime eyes. Yeah.

112
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:27,980
Stop being rude. Oh, you're talking about other people, not me. Okay, ears. Should you just not

113
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:45,880
have ears? Maybe you just shouldn't have them. All right, those ears are where a fish's ears are.

114
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:57,829
No, that's where a bird's ears are. That's fine. I like it. Ears are cringe anyways. Get rid of them.

115
00:18:57,829 --> 00:19:19,720
What? That's fine. No, that's all right. Like that. Ear openness. That's weird. Ear roll?

116
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:28,680
No, I don't want to mess with the ears too much because mess with the hair. Just really huge lobes.

117
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:55,900
No. An elf. Make him an elven. I kind of like the elven. Maybe not that extreme. It's a wood elf.

118
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:17,319
Okay. Cheekbones. Maybe not that much. How about temple depth? What is that doing? Temple height.

119
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:25,930
I like it higher. That's not bad. No, no, no, no. It's definitely going to be over here somewhere

120
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:37,640
like here. Cheekbone depth. No, way too. Put them in. That's not bad. Maybe a little bit out. That's

121
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:54,339
fine. Eye cheekbones are low. That's all right. Why does he look like Cartman? It does look like

122
00:20:54,339 --> 00:21:01,660
Eric Cartman. Yeah, just wait for when South Park does all grown up like the Rugrats did. And this

123
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:16,549
is what they're going to get. They just did that. They did? Oh, shit. I did not know that. They're

124
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:21,849
literally doing that right now. They just did that. They did that literally, literally in the

125
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:33,720
new special. Does he look like this? I don't want these to be that. No, no, no. Pull these back.

126
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:39,099
That's like way too comical. You know what I mean? Like, oh, that's so funny. No, no, no. That's

127
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:47,500
too comical. It needs to be a little bit dialed back here. The chin is messed up too. That's got

128
00:21:47,500 --> 00:22:04,519
to get fixed. Nose. Big or small nose? Probably small. We want the other features in the face to

129
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:29,859
really, really pop. Yeah, small. No, no, no. Not big. He has extra nostrils. No, that's too comical.

130
00:22:29,859 --> 00:22:47,180
I think like right, right where it was is good. I like that. All right. Now imagine if I could take

131
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:57,210
this guy into Dark Souls. That would be great. I feel like that's what I'm doing. Put it up high?

132
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:06,940
No, no, no, no. Not high. It looks like the imprint of somebody's shoe is on the front of his face.

133
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:12,490
Like this guy had a normal face and then like in a Tom and Jerry cartoon, somebody with a boot came

134
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:19,160
and kicked him in the face as hard as they could. That's the imprint of a shoe from the forehead to

135
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:37,380
the chin. We don't got to get too finicky with the nose. Looks like Trump. It looks like a Trump

136
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:58,410
caricature. No, I don't like what that just did. No, I don't like what that did either. Right here

137
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:10,230
in the middle. Keep it in the middle. His nose is way too pushed in to have any of these other

138
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:23,430
settings mean anything at all. All right, that's fine. Mouth. He just doesn't have any teeth.

139
00:24:24,140 --> 00:25:02,460
He just have no teeth. I like it. That's okay. It's his grandma. It's like an open mouth. Not that.

140
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:17,779
No, no, no. Not like this. Like this. Just the two lips. That's okay. A little bit lower down is fine.

141
00:25:17,779 --> 00:25:22,869
That's right. It's just a fish. I feel like I didn't touch anything but I feel like they're

142
00:25:22,869 --> 00:25:26,230
having trouble standing. Are they like swaying and moving weirdly to anybody else? I feel like

143
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:40,119
they're having trouble here. I didn't have- were they doing this the whole time? I don't think so.

144
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:47,269
Okay, that's fine. Oh wait, they're not supposed to have teeth. This is the- I don't have teeth

145
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:57,940
mouth but they're showing teeth. That doesn't make any sense anymore. Hey! Over the other way.

146
00:25:58,579 --> 00:26:10,980
Oh no. This is slowly becoming a sus image, isn't it? No, it's got to be like that. Pissed.

147
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:28,250
With a big underbite. All right, this is fucked up because I feel like this person, if they- if

148
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:32,789
like their boogers just go right into their mouth, that's fucked up. If this person's asleep on the

149
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:36,710
train and they have a runny nose, they're just pooling the runny nose directly into their mouth.

150
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:49,779
Okay, I think that's fine. Is that- maybe not that extreme? Maybe. That's too extreme, you think?

151
00:26:52,599 --> 00:27:04,309
That's fine. Like that. Oh, I don't want to look at that for the next like six hours. No, like this.

152
00:27:04,309 --> 00:27:18,299
I don't hate that. This is hard to look at. Yeah, I- that's why I don't want it to be that extreme

153
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:33,000
because we have to look at this for a long time. We have to look at this for a while. Double chin?

154
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:47,460
There- I mean, there is no double chin. There's one single bullfrog chin. It's not double. We've-

155
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:59,900
we're past the point where there's a double. All right, almost done. Should we just make

156
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:17,930
him a beanbag chair? I don't know. Jaw height? Oh, he can pull it up. Yeah, but his- his head,

157
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:27,299
his chin is going into his body. Leave the poor- leave this poor man alone. Is that too much?

158
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:37,349
Because it's- I don't know. I feel like that's too much. We made Patrick Star

159
00:28:42,329 --> 00:29:06,250
unavailable. All right, hold on. What about the hair? Wait, hold on. Oh no. It can't be Patrick Star

160
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:10,410
though. That's not gonna- it's gonna be- that's funny for right now. You think it's funny right

161
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:16,619
now. Let's make him Grimace instead. I like Grimace better than Patrick Star. It's Majin

162
00:29:16,619 --> 00:29:23,670
Boo. I know, but we all think this is like funny for like the next 10 minutes. After- after he's

163
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:27,269
purple Grimace for four hours, I don't- I don't think we're gonna think it's funny anymore. It's

164
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:44,470
like a one- it's a one minute joke. It's funny right now. Like Mr. Greens? No, they can't keep

165
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:50,619
Grimace. Oh, okay. Fine. I'll keep it as Grimace. I like Grimace the most out of all of these.

166
00:29:50,619 --> 00:29:59,910
But he- I- it's gonna be so distracting. If it's Grimace, he has to lose the hair. Hold on. I am

167
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:38,220
not committing yet. Facial hair? No. Okay, here we go. First Lady? That's just on- on this guy.

168
00:30:38,220 --> 00:31:00,059
It's Elvis. I don't think. Half of these just look like coral reefs on him. They're so all- look at

169
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:12,470
this. This looks like a coral reef. This doesn't even look like hair. This looks like underwater

170
00:31:13,029 --> 00:31:26,279
sea creature. Okay, if- like if- okay, if I showed you this image right here, and I told you- and I

171
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:31,849
asked you, what is this? What is this image? I don't- what would you say? You'd probably say

172
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:56,619
some deep sea thing. Okay, I think we found it. This is a sea cucumber. This is a cabbage? It

173
00:31:56,619 --> 00:32:08,519
actually kind of does look like cabbage, you're right. There's so many. This one's good. But if

174
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:15,029
we have- if we're gonna commit to Grimace, it can't- Grimace doesn't have hair. I mean, technically

175
00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:37,819
Grimace is covered in hair. There's so many options. Wait, we- let's go back to the top.

176
00:32:37,819 --> 00:32:46,500
We started in the middle. He looks like a geode. I mean, this is the easy one if it's Grimace,

177
00:32:46,500 --> 00:33:08,009
but it can't be. I'm going back. He's not gonna be Grimace. Beehive? Oh, oh, oh, okay.

178
00:33:11,619 --> 00:33:22,599
I like this one. I like this one. We're keeping this one. None of the facial hair is gonna show

179
00:33:22,599 --> 00:34:10,360
up. No, no facial hair. Oh, I feel like he's about to start singing the Smash Mouth song. Yeah,

180
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:18,010
like, right now. No, no facial hair. Sideburns? I actually like that. Yep. It's Elvis. It's Elvis.

181
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:32,010
It's Elvis. It's Elvis. It's Elvis. It's Elvis. I made- I'm done. It's gonna be Elvis. Austin

182
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:47,449
Powers? Okay, hold on. Evil scientist. I'll take full. All right, hold on. I need- I gotta get this

183
00:34:47,449 --> 00:35:07,340
right. Let me see what it looks like when he's not purple Grimace. We'll fix the hair. It's just fat

184
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:15,030
bastard from Austin Powers. Fuck, it has to be Grimace now. But that's- no, I can't do just- look,

185
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:32,280
he's purple. I don't want it to be purple. No, no. We're going back. I'll get sick of the Grimace

186
00:35:32,280 --> 00:36:02,219
joke in 20 minutes. I'm gonna fix this. I actually don't hate this. I don't hate this. Wait,

187
00:36:02,219 --> 00:36:16,550
why does he have, like, a purple fade? Why does he have a- is there purple, like, highlights?

188
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:37,179
Oh, it's because the secondary color. No, this doesn't look like- oh my god, this does not-

189
00:36:37,179 --> 00:36:43,449
somebody said this looks like Adam Driver. What are you talking about? How do you see Adam Driver?

190
00:36:43,449 --> 00:36:47,210
Adam Driver is like a handsome, like, dashing man. What are you talking about?

191
00:36:53,670 --> 00:37:08,460
Oh, I don't see it. I don't. I like this though because we're gonna keep it like this. I think

192
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:12,949
it's perfect. That's not Adam Driver. It's not at all. I don't even know where you're getting

193
00:37:12,949 --> 00:37:17,030
that from. I don't know how so many people are- I don't know how many- so many people are agreeing

194
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:40,019
with you. So many people are saying Jay Leno, Dan Schneider. No, this is not Gabe Newell, Orson Welles.

195
00:37:40,019 --> 00:37:46,820
Okay, this is- everyone has- all right, let's keep this for now, I think. I need to keep this.

196
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:52,860
All right, I think we're gonna- British accent?

197
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:01,019
Keep making British.

198
00:38:01,019 --> 00:38:32,380
It's Snape. It is Snape. I like Snape the best. Oh, what the fuck?

199
00:38:32,380 --> 00:39:03,909
Everybody stop talking. All right, we have, like, the soy face. I'm just gonna put this

200
00:39:03,909 --> 00:39:09,800
on top of me reviewing, like, the new PS5 controller. These are all just thumbnail faces.

201
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,610
See, what you guys don't know is most YouTubers just sit there in front of their webcam and go

202
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:21,690
like this in about maybe two to three minutes, and that's what they've been using on every thumbnail

203
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:27,289
for the last five to ten straight fucking years. They've never edited them. They've never updated

204
00:39:27,369 --> 00:39:35,500
them. Are you re- can I really be, you know, inclined to think that you're, like, very,

205
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:41,130
very scared of something? If that's an image that you were scared- is this the same,

206
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:46,619
I was scared of this game or this movie or this TV show or this thing, like, seven years ago?

207
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:52,059
How do I know that you're scared? You may have been scared when you made this, but not- you're

208
00:39:52,059 --> 00:40:02,710
just pasting it on everything else. Oh, no, no, no, sorry, that's not accurate. They don't have the

209
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:06,869
looking up towards the ceiling with your eyes with your finger on your chin thinking about something.

210
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:24,630
Isn't that interesting? They forgot that one. I think blank is the best. This is taking shots.

211
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:34,099
No, no, I'm not- who- okay, taking shots. I'm the guy that's standing outside screaming. Like,

212
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:36,900
okay, you know when you go to, like, a convention where you go to something and there's, like,

213
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:42,340
a person that's, like, screaming about God outside? It's just like, what's the- what's the- who's this

214
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:50,949
person? Like, I am that person. Everybody else is looking at me like, what the fuck are you talking

215
00:40:50,949 --> 00:41:23,320
about, dude? Everybody does this shit. Do Dopey, please. Fine. Oh, nice. Okay. Oh, this- I love the-

216
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:39,130
this one's really bouncy. This one's very bouncy. What was that? I think we may have found it.

217
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:47,940
Not quite, though. Zombie? He looks like a big baby. This is a big baby. I don't like this at all.

218
00:41:47,940 --> 00:42:22,500
I have to move on now. Oh! Gangsta lean. O2 tank pull? Wasted? Slow and steady. Oh, yeah. Yep. I

219
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:36,179
don't need to see anymore. No, I don't have to see any other ones at all. Read the news. Carry books?

220
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:50,070
Carry clipboard? Metal detector? Do you actually walk around like this? Out shopping? Keeping dry?

221
00:42:50,949 --> 00:42:59,690
Or laundry day? Um, I- I think we- it has to be this one. Or this one. No, no. This- I like-

222
00:43:00,489 --> 00:43:10,730
I'm not gonna- do I move- how do I do this? Okay. No, I like this one. This one's better. You do

223
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:13,929
understand that there's so much opportunity for, like, me to make, like, a- like, a laugh-out-loud

224
00:43:13,929 --> 00:43:18,039
joke where there's, like, a car coming and I do this into the road and get hit? Are you serious?

225
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:31,719
You don't think I'm gonna pick this one? This is the easy one. Combat style. There's only one.

226
00:43:31,719 --> 00:44:02,250
Compliment? Slow kisses? Oh! Guitar? There's no music.

227
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:11,190
Photo? Oh, I see, okay.

228
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:22,039
This one's probably-

229
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:46,659
Okay. Um. Oh, the harmonica. The jig is good too. Okay, I guess we're gonna use the harmonica.

230
00:44:47,219 --> 00:45:06,860
Yeah, blues is more dynamic. Haunt. Okay, what do we got? Bring the voodoo. Test bump. Come get some.

231
00:45:07,659 --> 00:45:18,150
Eat takeout. I mean, this one works for this character, but eat the dead? Oh!

232
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:21,980
What, I can eat them on the ground?

233
00:45:35,659 --> 00:45:37,820
I like this one a lot, but I don't- I don't think it fits.

234
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:54,309
Sword? Oh! Wait, it doesn't actually wrap?

235
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:07,019
Nope. Nope. Wait, that was Harry Potter. That's Voldemort.

236
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:20,940
That's a pretty good Voldemort scream. Just smoking? Is that a cigarette? Okay, it's a cigarette.

237
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:39,699
How about the wanker? Oh, okay. What the fuck? Oh! Look at the belly button.

238
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:51,320
What? It either has to be vomit or- or the fire breather.

239
00:46:55,639 --> 00:47:10,630
No, I'm not gonna do the default taunt from GTA Online, please. I think we're ready. Okay,

240
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:16,329
we did everything right. Let me make sure this is right, okay. Body. I don't think anything else

241
00:47:16,329 --> 00:47:26,489
needs to happen. All right. Are you guys ready to play the game? I am. Eat takeout. I don't even

242
00:47:26,489 --> 00:47:41,179
know how to do any of these things. Time to go. Wait. No, okay, no, no. Yeah. Three, two, one, go.

243
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:51,960
That looks like it healed nicely. Be careful, doctor. This patient's dangerous. You got anything

244
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:56,119
you want to say to the judge? You better start thinking of it now. You're wasting your time.

245
00:47:56,119 --> 00:48:05,739
Let's get ahold of Troy. Oh my god. Hey, is it really you? This is why I couldn't be Patrick.

246
00:48:05,739 --> 00:48:10,139
My brother was in the Saints and he told me all about you. Listen, we gotta get you out of here.

247
00:48:10,139 --> 00:48:14,619
Well, I'm sure if we ask nicely. I know a way out. Yeah? Then why are you still- I feel like

248
00:48:14,619 --> 00:48:19,500
I'm watching Gumball. Like these two are from different animation styles and different complete

249
00:48:20,059 --> 00:48:25,260
art styles. You really expect me to trust some guy I don't even know? Come on. I just got myself

250
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:29,260
shanked so I could get a chance to talk to you. Doesn't that show I'm loyal? It shows that you're

251
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:33,980
dumb enough to let yourself get stabbed. I'm trying to help you. You know what I got the last time I

252
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:41,500
trusted someone? Blown the fuck up. You need me. The hell I do. I got the Saints. Sure you do.

253
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:45,980
What's that supposed to mean? How long do you think you've been out? I don't know,

254
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:49,739
mate. Two to three weeks. Look, I know you think you're a badass, but do you even know where you're

255
00:48:49,739 --> 00:48:54,780
at? Without me, you'll be wandering around the prison for hours. Even if you manage to hide from

256
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:58,780
the guards that long, and if you actually figure out how to make it outside these walls, you're

257
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:02,219
just gonna find out that you're sitting on a goddamn- Why does the voice fit him? I'm pretty

258
00:49:02,219 --> 00:49:06,780
sure- It does. I don't know. It just does. You got a boat stashed here? No, but- I think that's by

259
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:17,429
design. All right, let's get out of here. Those little shoes. What? Why am I, um, why am I floating?

260
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:37,460
Okay, um, punch and block. Hold will- Okay, that's not correct. Three successful strikes will

261
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:45,079
devastate a combo. Alternate- Okay, I need to find out what that is. Okay, that's jump. Okay,

262
00:49:45,079 --> 00:50:00,039
right trigger is punch. Left trigger is another kind of punch. Wait, what did I just do? I have

263
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:16,119
to kill the doctor first. Okay, play the tutorial, sure. Ow. All right, well, what's block? Okay,

264
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:20,440
holding- You can hold the button down, but what's block? There was a block. All right, that's like

265
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:30,650
my right bumper. E is kick door, but that's not what it is. Okay, it's, it's, uh, why?

266
00:50:34,869 --> 00:50:51,659
Let's go! Punch, punch, punch! Holy shit. Get her! Get the fuck out of my way! Use R? What was R?

267
00:50:52,219 --> 00:51:06,150
Oh, the weapon wheel. Okay. All right. I thought the mod, um, gave Xbox 360 controls. Maybe not

268
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:25,929
here. I know there's a sprint. What is it? All right, crouch. Okay, it's push in. What's sprint?

269
00:51:25,929 --> 00:51:33,699
Left bumper? Right bumper? Okay, nice. Thank you. Thank you. This is your mini map. Uh, markers and

270
00:51:33,699 --> 00:51:38,869
GPS navigation lines here will guide you to objectives. Set GPS waypoints. Okay, this is,

271
00:51:38,869 --> 00:51:48,409
there's a map. Of course, there's a pause menu, right? Ooh, this is huge. Holy shit. Okay, let's

272
00:51:48,409 --> 00:52:05,510
go. Kill the guard and take their gun. Is there a sneak? Okay, not really. Did they get the gun?

273
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:09,190
Okay, running over weapons you don't have automatically picks them up. Change your weapon,

274
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:19,449
press and hold Q. That don't need, that's easy. I already have that. Okay, melee bash or fire gun?

275
00:52:19,449 --> 00:52:34,570
Okay, good. Good to know. All right, let's go. Oh my god, that was horrible. Was I not supposed to

276
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:46,739
do that? Was I not supposed to do that? I don't know. Why would I kick him like in the balls?

277
00:52:48,280 --> 00:53:01,900
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Wait, that's a new, that's a new gun. Use R. Don't shoot me. What? Oh,

278
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:22,119
wait. Dual wield? Can I? Is it Y? Oh shit. Oh well, it's okay. I'll figure it out. Oh, fuck.

279
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:29,659
We just gotta run. We just gotta get out of here. Okay, wait, wait, wait. Does it do, can you do

280
00:53:29,659 --> 00:53:37,320
weld? I don't think you can do weld. R to do a weld. Yeah, but it's using the, it's not giving

281
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:48,389
me controller props. Fine aim is V, which is, I'm assuming it's probably, let's see. Okay, fine aim

282
00:53:48,389 --> 00:54:11,739
is right on the stick. What the fuck? Why did, why would it explode? I might, okay. All right,

283
00:54:11,739 --> 00:54:27,800
let's get to the dock. Sprint, yep. Thanks to Chad, I know how to do that. Oh, let's get to the docks.

284
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:43,210
How do you drive? Oh, fuck. It's, wait, it's A? It's A and that's, I think I have to change this.

285
00:54:44,090 --> 00:55:02,039
I have to change this. Get out. I remember this happening. That's how Saint Root, Saint,

286
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:21,500
Saint's Row 2 works on console. Oh, fuck. Okay. Defend the boat. From what? Does this thing overheat?

287
00:55:25,849 --> 00:55:36,280
Helicopter? I got it. Two pistol shots makes it smoke and explode, but I can't take this out

288
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:51,190
for the life of me. Oh, wait, I got to reload. Podler aim? It's hard on a controller. Give me a

289
00:55:51,190 --> 00:56:12,219
break. Where's the music? I turned the music off because people said there was DMCA. Okay,

290
00:56:12,219 --> 00:56:18,260
that's good. All right. There's nobody, what do you mean don't let them catch us? There's nobody here.

291
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:35,300
Oh, it's the helicopter. Okay. Well, I can't. Oh my God. I got it. Just put on Christmas music.

292
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:41,989
That's a really actually brilliant idea. Just put on like a royalty-free Christmas music playlist.

293
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:44,630
Jesus, when did this happen?

294
00:56:56,420 --> 00:57:01,460
A very Kevin McLeod Christmas. Ludwig's Christmas album. Oh yeah.

295
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,090
I keep forgetting it looks like this.

296
00:57:24,889 --> 00:57:28,889
Cops are looking for you and a lot's changed. I say you just go buy a beer and soak up as

297
00:57:28,889 --> 00:57:33,769
much information as you can. Thanks Carlos. For a second, I thought he said go grow a beard and like

298
00:57:33,769 --> 00:57:38,570
lay low. Like I'm not the most distinct looking person in the entire city. I could, guys, I could

299
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:43,019
grow a beard. I could wear like eight different like clothes. I could put five hats on. It doesn't

300
00:57:43,019 --> 00:57:56,219
matter. 500 bucks. Save the game. Yeah. So games, I've heard do not even with the gentleman of the

301
00:57:56,219 --> 00:58:14,199
row mod that it doesn't matter. Save every time you have an opportunity. Save game. Okay.

302
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:26,469
So how do I like, what am I trying to do here? All right. Pick up boxes. This is not like Donkey

303
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:46,219
Kong. What am I talking about? Wait, what's in here? Third Street Saints mission. Johnny

304
00:58:46,219 --> 00:58:55,510
Bravo really let himself go. Okay. I need some new clothes. Why is everybody mad at me? Oh,

305
00:58:55,510 --> 00:59:12,219
these are police. But wait, I need to get out of here. Wait, I can pick up the trash can. What?

306
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:24,550
How do I pick this up? No, fuck. I didn't want to do that. How do I pick it up? What's wrong with me?

307
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:35,219
Taunts? Is it, it's B? It's not B. I just took a shotgun out. It's not B. How do I pick up the

308
00:59:35,219 --> 00:59:47,530
trash can? It's R? It's not. It's not. Don't hit that person. What are you doing? Leave me alone.

309
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:52,099
I'm not even trying to hurt you. Get away from me, please. Get away from me. Get away from me. Get

310
00:59:52,099 --> 01:00:04,699
away from me. Get away from me. Wait, did you just bump? Leave me alone. I'm just hold A? Oh,

311
01:00:04,699 --> 01:00:16,119
my God. Please leave me alone. They're going to start swarming me. Oh, my God. This lady is

312
01:00:16,119 --> 01:00:28,650
relentless. I didn't. Okay. Where do I need to go? This way. You're not still following me, right?

313
01:00:28,650 --> 01:00:46,789
No. All right. Good. Pick up trash can. Somebody said hold A. Okay. It is hold A. Oh, my God. That

314
01:00:46,789 --> 01:01:08,570
guy. Go buy a lottery ticket. What the fuck? Imagine throwing a trash can at somebody. What

315
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:20,099
the fuck is happening right now? Oh, fuck. Okay. I'm going to go. I need a car. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

316
01:01:20,099 --> 01:01:38,789
Oh, shit. I should have done that. Give me that. Get on the bike and go. Go. Get on the bike. What

317
01:01:38,789 --> 01:01:44,789
is she holding? What is that? Was that a drill? She's got a fucking power drill. Oh, she's drilling

318
01:01:44,789 --> 01:02:01,460
that. Wait a minute. What? Oh, fuck. I didn't. Who are these people? Get away from me. Okay.

319
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:15,989
Hold on. I didn't stop. I have to stop. Wait a minute. Okay. I'm fine. I'm okay. If I let myself

320
01:02:15,989 --> 01:02:22,420
go too hard there, I'm going to get hurt. I need to slow down. Oh, wait. I'm still holding a gun.

321
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:43,880
Put that away. Don't do stupid fucking tricks, you idiot. Just get to the thing. Okay. Buy clothes.

322
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:48,539
What? Clothing stores allow you to customize your character. By buying clothes, you can increase

323
01:02:48,539 --> 01:02:56,380
your style rank. Oh, it's because I have a gun out. Okay. Purchase some clothes. We can get hats.

324
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:05,960
None of these are going to look right at all. This really is a bicycle seat.

325
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:22,170
Should I get the bicycle seat? I'm going to get this. No, no. Hold on. You can do different styles?

326
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:40,659
Arts. It's the Joker. Make him the Joker? Are those cops after me? I hear sirens. It's a shower cap.

327
01:03:40,659 --> 01:03:59,960
Yeah, I don't want this. Actually, I'd rather have this. Okay. Oh, goodness. How much is this?

328
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:20,869
Okay. How about the... Keep the basic tee on for now. The tank top. Are you sure you don't want me

329
01:04:20,869 --> 01:04:39,380
to have the bathing suit? The onesie bathing suit? Okay. What about... I don't want anything

330
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:53,739
underneath because I want it to be a bathing suit. Is there none? I guess I could do the jean shorts.

331
01:04:53,739 --> 01:04:59,059
I have to be honest. There's no way that foot's coming out of that shoe ever again. Those

332
01:04:59,059 --> 01:05:13,190
essentially have been surgically put on. They're not coming out. Roller skates? No way. Can I roller

333
01:05:13,269 --> 01:05:33,099
skate around? Keep in the socks. Definitely. I want these. I just want tighty-whities on.

334
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:59,480
Okay. That was good. Should I have arm pads? No, no. Outfits? No. Okay. What else? Viscillaneous one?

335
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:14,570
No. A tool belt? Yes. Look at that hammer. Absolutely. I want the tool belt. I'm ready.

336
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:23,449
Okay. Switch to wardrobe. How do I switch to wardrobe? What space? No. What did I just buy?

337
01:06:23,449 --> 01:06:32,280
Did I just buy the tool belt twice? What happened? No. What? Space is space. Okay. Well,

338
01:06:32,280 --> 01:07:00,599
whatever. Why can I do that? Can I take the cash? Is there money in here? Oh my god. That lady. Is

339
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:05,639
there money in here? How do I get the money out? Why can I leave? Am I too big to leave the store?

340
01:07:05,639 --> 01:07:28,860
How do I get? How do I? I want the money in this thing. Is there money? I already got it. Oh,

341
01:07:28,860 --> 01:08:00,340
I got it. I got it. Yeah, I am in roller skates, but I'm not skating. Oh, damn it. That was so

342
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:04,920
close to hitting that guy in the head with trash. Save, save, save, save, save, save, save, save.

343
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:39,479
I need a car. Wrong button. I wish I could skate around. All right. What's reverse? Give me a break.

344
01:08:39,479 --> 01:09:01,020
What the fuck? No. Get. Get. Leave me alone. Please. I thought that I just got struck by

345
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:16,500
lightning. I thought that was lightning that just hit right there. Leave me alone. You stole his car.

346
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:28,699
Is there a handbrake? What's the handbrake? Christmas music. All right. All right. All

347
01:09:28,699 --> 01:09:37,500
on. All to having is going to be a disaster. I got to be careful. Let me save it right here.

348
01:09:37,500 --> 01:10:01,130
Don't forget about Christmas music. I know I'm getting it. I hope it doesn't crash.

349
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:16,600
Will crash. It might. We'll find out. All right. Chris. Should I put on Ludwig's music? How many

350
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:36,010
songs did he do? Oh shit. He's got like a shitload of songs. No music. I'm putting it on. It's going

351
01:10:36,010 --> 01:10:53,020
to be just low in the background. Pretty relaxed. Okay. Did it crash? I could do my own rendition

352
01:10:53,020 --> 01:11:14,939
too, if you want. You can't even hear the music. It's drawn up by fucking rain. Hold on. This.

353
01:11:22,199 --> 01:11:32,500
It actually works really well. I think this Christmas sucks. It's scary out here.

354
01:11:48,439 --> 01:11:51,000
I have to pause it for this. I have to pause it.

355
01:11:59,699 --> 01:12:09,380
Okay. I can't turn it off. I can't alt tab. Hey, Barry, turn this shit off. I can't.

356
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:34,630
Christmas is ruined.

357
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:56,140
Wait, what? Who's that? Oh, I don't know who that was. Why did I just do that?

358
01:13:02,819 --> 01:13:07,619
No, how do I have to fight? Why are these people here? Is somebody up on the roof?

359
01:13:07,619 --> 01:13:15,029
Where is this person? I don't know where this person is. I missed that whole cut scene. I was

360
01:13:15,029 --> 01:13:27,319
laughing at the Christmas music. How do I get out of here? How do I get out of here?

361
01:13:28,279 --> 01:13:34,180
Do I have to fight these people? They're on the mini-map. Are you on the mini-map?

362
01:13:34,819 --> 01:13:39,619
I don't know. Are you on the mini-map? I think she's on the mini-map. Are you on the mini-map?

363
01:13:42,619 --> 01:14:04,140
Are these people on the mini-map? I gotta get out of here. Let's get out of here. Who is this?

364
01:14:08,619 --> 01:14:17,510
What are you doing? What are you gonna spray with? Pepper spray? A spray can? I don't even...

365
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:22,329
Just wait. Hold on. I don't want to shoot you, but I'm gonna...

366
01:14:24,489 --> 01:14:29,529
All right. You're fucking dead, buddy. I'm sick of this shit. Get the fuck out of here. Get out of

367
01:14:29,529 --> 01:14:52,779
here. Get off. Get off. I'm getting lightheaded now. Okay. Let's go to the... We only have three

368
01:14:52,779 --> 01:15:25,109
minutes? What? The court. I gotta get to the courthouse. Who's behind me? Give me this car.

369
01:15:25,109 --> 01:16:03,210
I gotta get to the courthouse in three minutes. Go. All right. This is good. Can we just take a

370
01:16:03,210 --> 01:16:14,250
second to understand? This is good music. They did a fucking fantastic job. All right. Go.

371
01:16:14,729 --> 01:16:26,680
I'm at the court. What am I doing here? Why am I here? Find the courtroom? What?

372
01:16:30,199 --> 01:16:32,920
I don't know where this person is. I wasn't even listening. I wasn't paying any attention.

373
01:16:33,479 --> 01:16:48,489
What room are they in? Which door is it? Oh, I need a break.

374
01:16:48,970 --> 01:17:05,340
It's the most wonderful time of the year. With the kids jingle belling and everyone telling

375
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:14,060
you be of good cheer. What am I doing here? Mr. Gatt, you've been convicted of over 300 murders.

376
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:17,819
Do you really expect this appeal to work? I figured with the statute of limitations,

377
01:17:17,819 --> 01:17:22,300
it really should be closer to two feet. There's no statute of limitations for murder.

378
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:32,460
Oh, fuck. Hold on. I gotta pause it. Jesus. I need a break. My fucking head's gonna explode.

379
01:17:47,909 --> 01:17:56,199
Fuck just happened. Who is this? Is that me? What am I doing here?

380
01:17:57,829 --> 01:18:29,180
Oh, I'm breaking him out. All right. Let's go. So I'm breaking out this criminal.

381
01:18:29,979 --> 01:18:38,310
How do we leave? No, I'm gonna put the music back on. I promise. I need a break. My whole

382
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:53,739
fucking body hurts. Let's just fucking run. Who cares? I can't jump over that. Go, go,

383
01:18:53,739 --> 01:19:06,539
go, go, go, go. Was this the judge? What the judge? It's a shotgun. All right. Get a soda.

384
01:19:06,539 --> 01:19:25,420
Can I buy a soda? All right. Ready? Go. Oh my God. You guys cannot hit anything.

385
01:19:25,979 --> 01:19:45,479
Fucking storm troopers. Oh, fuck. Don't talk shit. Hold on. Okay. Go. Go. Oh my God. Get us out. Get

386
01:19:45,479 --> 01:19:52,789
us out. Get us out. Get us out. Get us out. Get us out. Get us out. Okay. That really just worked.

387
01:19:52,789 --> 01:20:11,670
Yeah, it did. Oh, wait. No. No, no, no, no. I thought you were the guy. Where's the guy?

388
01:20:12,630 --> 01:20:23,750
Where's the guy? Oh shit. Oh no. He's fucked. Oh no.

389
01:20:29,130 --> 01:20:32,090
Get out of the way, please. How do I revive him?

390
01:20:32,810 --> 01:20:46,119
Oh shit. Where am I? No. Damn it. Fuck. I thought he was going to get in the car.

391
01:20:46,119 --> 01:20:59,590
I thought he was going to get in the car. Oh no. Did I crash? All right. All right. I got to focus.

392
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:25,060
Get away. Hold on. I just want to stop doing like modal combat moves. What do you mean abandon?

393
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:33,960
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Where are you? What are you doing? What are you doing?

394
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:54,550
Okay. All right. Get up. All right. I got to remember what E is. Okay. E is triangle.

395
01:21:54,550 --> 01:22:09,640
You good? Let's move. I didn't know he was going to get stuck back there.

396
01:22:10,439 --> 01:22:27,529
Just run. Just run. Just run. Run. Run. Just run through. Run. Let's go. I'm not messing with

397
01:22:27,529 --> 01:22:44,340
the judge with the shotgun. It's not going to happen. All right. Don't get stuck in the door

398
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:57,829
this time. I'm dual welding? I'm not. I am not dual welding. Okay. Here we go. Leave.

399
01:22:58,470 --> 01:23:07,609
Somebody just said pacifist run. What? What? I just like I've killed like fifth. What are you

400
01:23:07,609 --> 01:23:17,989
talking about? Let's go. Get out. Get in.

401
01:23:27,189 --> 01:23:28,470
Troop behind us. Somebody behind us.

402
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:48,470
How do I shoot the gun? Wait till they get out. That's the strategy. Wait till they get out of

403
01:23:48,470 --> 01:24:04,550
the car. That was uncalled for. Why did he do that? That was not what I did it for.

404
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:17,319
Forgive and forget allows you to remove all notoriety for a price.

405
01:24:20,039 --> 01:24:33,430
I'm in a cop car. I'm still a cop car. Put the music back on. All right. Hold on.

406
01:24:36,090 --> 01:25:01,609
What happened? Holy shit. What the fuck is going on here? Oh no. Oh no. Have you noticed that my

407
01:25:01,609 --> 01:25:07,479
voice has been like, I don't know, I've turned into like an old library, like an old librarian

408
01:25:08,119 --> 01:25:16,699
when I laugh. It's like, oh no. Oh my goodness. When did I become the librarian in the cinnamon

409
01:25:16,699 --> 01:25:21,819
toast crunch commercial that gets mad at how loud the crunching is? I may have just made that

410
01:25:21,819 --> 01:25:29,510
commercial, but I don't think I did. So that's a commercial, right? That's like, it's so crunchy.

411
01:25:30,149 --> 01:25:57,539
Why did we do? What was that for? All right. You're good. 500 bucks. Oh, I have a red light

412
01:25:57,539 --> 01:26:06,090
apartment crib now. Cool. This is your respect meter. Respect this game by completing activities

413
01:26:06,090 --> 01:26:13,619
and diversions. Once you have enough respect, you can play missions. Oh, okay. It's like experience.

414
01:26:13,619 --> 01:26:21,369
All right. Go to the previous map to view activity locations. Okay. You can set a waypoint

415
01:26:21,369 --> 01:26:29,640
on the map. Okay. Very cool. Set a waypoint for an activity now. All right. So these are

416
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:39,300
just activities, vehicle dealer, unknown activity. Well, I feel like it has to be in this zone here,

417
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:59,819
right? It doesn't matter. All right. We're going to go here. Activity. This is my truck. It's not

418
01:26:59,819 --> 01:27:12,090
your truck. Okay. Well, this is probably my bike. She's sitting on this. You're going to get on,

419
01:27:12,649 --> 01:27:32,340
but she acts like she's going to get on. Okay. Save. Yep. All right. Let's get that music back

420
01:27:32,340 --> 01:28:01,979
on. You thought I was going to run them all over, didn't you? Nope. All the rules. We're

421
01:28:01,979 --> 01:28:29,369
listening to Christmas music. Oh, fuck the rules. Who cares? What's on that truck? Whoa.

422
01:28:43,899 --> 01:28:59,289
I had to hold that to the end of the song. You know I did. Fuzz.

423
01:29:10,300 --> 01:29:28,840
Don't turn it off. I'm keeping it on.

424
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:41,159
It's too loud. There. No, it's not.

425
01:29:50,779 --> 01:29:54,300
Let's go wait. Impersonate one of Stillwater's finest and provide quality footage of the Fuzz

426
01:29:54,300 --> 01:30:09,510
crew for cash and respect. Oh, shit. Wait, they have to catch the streaker? That's the

427
01:30:09,510 --> 01:30:16,869
streaker right there. That's the streaker right there. What? We just killed him. That person's

428
01:30:16,869 --> 01:30:23,539
streaking right now. Wait, are there more than one streaker? Why is it more than one person? What?

429
01:30:23,539 --> 01:30:44,779
What? Oh, wait. That person. How is that person not naked? I need more footage. Why do we need

430
01:30:44,779 --> 01:30:52,380
more footage? Get away from me. I'm trying to film something. I don't have enough footage.

431
01:30:53,670 --> 01:30:57,510
How is this not footage? It's just zoomed in like. Wait, why is there a cop in the car?

432
01:30:58,390 --> 01:31:03,670
Why did they get in the car?

433
01:31:06,439 --> 01:31:11,560
Fucking turn the record button on. Turn the record button on. What are you doing?

434
01:31:19,590 --> 01:31:32,180
Oh, apprehend. How do I apprehend him? What do you grab him? All right, get him. Don't kill him.

435
01:31:32,180 --> 01:31:46,460
Apprehend him. What are you doing? What? How do we apprehend him? He's. What?

436
01:31:58,579 --> 01:32:15,340
I get it. There's more. OK, there's more than one. Stop the lewd pedestrians.

437
01:32:16,060 --> 01:32:24,760
I'll get it. I get it. I still have a minute. I first came out the window.

438
01:32:27,979 --> 01:32:40,789
Have they been stopped? I don't understand what stops them. Don't run away. Get out of the way.

439
01:32:45,270 --> 01:32:52,489
OK, wait, he already has enough camera footage of you running over perps.

440
01:32:53,449 --> 01:32:58,390
Oh, god damn it. Really? I feel like that's what you guys say.

441
01:32:59,109 --> 01:33:04,420
A chat sick of you like running people over and falling off ledges. Do something else, streamer.

442
01:33:18,489 --> 01:33:39,399
Squid Game. Hit him. We did it. Don't give me a minus two for that. You all fucking love that show.

443
01:33:48,279 --> 01:34:02,859
Oh, it's more level two. Oh, god. Do I have to do it again? I don't know. This is just an activity.

444
01:34:02,859 --> 01:34:17,159
OK, I'll try it one more time. That's in the script. You can quit at any time. Yeah, I'll do

445
01:34:17,159 --> 01:34:33,930
one more. How do I fly off the top of the screen? I don't know what that was. Was that him? Holy shit.

446
01:34:45,319 --> 01:35:00,699
Oh, my god. Get out of my way. Oh, my please. I'm done. I'm not doing this anymore.

447
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:10,979
Activities. Turn it off. What is this? No. Turn it off. Activities. Can I turn it off?

448
01:35:14,140 --> 01:35:27,880
Oh, down on the D-pad. Cool. OK, that's cool. No, don't. I just hit retry. Oh, my god. No,

449
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:32,729
get out of here. I wanted to exit it and not be like, oh, retry. Press A.

450
01:35:33,369 --> 01:35:42,970
Meet me at Aisha's place. We got to figure out our next move.

451
01:35:42,970 --> 01:36:11,819
What do I do? Where's the walker? There it is. Boomer. All right, the album's almost over,

452
01:36:11,819 --> 01:36:44,520
so I got to make the best use of it. Come on. What the fuck?

453
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:53,739
I don't care about the presents under Christmas tree. I don't need to hang my stockings

454
01:36:53,739 --> 01:37:02,500
Fuck you. Santa Claus won't make me happy. The toy on Christmas day.

455
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:19,159
Fuck all of you. Hit me already. Whatever. In the crosswalk. I'll turn it off. Ow, my eyes.

456
01:37:20,359 --> 01:37:22,039
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Perfect.

457
01:37:22,199 --> 01:37:28,460
As for much this Christmas, I won't even wish for snow.

458
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:38,710
I'm just gonna keep on waiting underneath the mistletoe. I will make a list and send it

459
01:37:38,710 --> 01:37:47,239
to the North Pole for Saint Nick. I will stay awake to hear those magic reindeer

460
01:37:47,239 --> 01:38:07,819
Because I just want you here tonight, holding so tight. No! Christmas is over.

461
01:38:07,819 --> 01:38:12,300
What the fuck? All the lights are shining so brightly everywhere.

462
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:26,569
The sound of children's laughter fills the air. Those sleigh bells ringing.

463
01:38:27,529 --> 01:38:28,010
No!

464
01:38:44,579 --> 01:38:54,279
It's not gonna happen. I'm trying to scare people. Oh, whatever. I'm done. We'll just go.

465
01:38:58,100 --> 01:39:03,500
Just do it on the highway instead. Yeah, I know. Good idea. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

466
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:18,279
Oh my god, fucking hit me already. You're ruining the whole joke.

467
01:39:35,020 --> 01:39:51,689
Oh my god, dude, please. Wait, this one's not royalty-free.

468
01:39:52,409 --> 01:40:05,829
What's this over here? What is that? This is a doctor's office?

469
01:40:10,180 --> 01:40:29,989
Uh, what are you talking about? Can I buy stuff? You thought Ludwig's album was...

470
01:40:31,029 --> 01:40:35,510
Holy goodness. Okay, let me try that again. Three, two, one.

471
01:40:36,550 --> 01:40:39,829
You thought Ludwig's album was royalty-free? Omega-lul.

472
01:40:39,829 --> 01:40:55,899
I want that. The person has a sword. I want it. Wait, I can't take the sword?

473
01:40:56,539 --> 01:41:20,340
Oh, this is a costume. Hey, how do you pull the camera back when you're in the car?

474
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:27,689
I know this is the way to do it, right? Select? I want to go get a hamburger.

475
01:41:27,689 --> 01:41:39,750
It's B? It's not B. Humper? It's not Y. Y's jump out.

476
01:41:40,390 --> 01:41:55,539
Cruise control? Let's look behind. It's V. Not V. L3? Yeah. R2 and Y?

477
01:42:00,260 --> 01:42:06,890
What the fuck? What the hell's going on? Is this a gang?

478
01:42:12,550 --> 01:42:22,140
How would you ever bring a knife to a gunfight? Oh, hell yeah. Oh shit.

479
01:42:24,579 --> 01:42:30,659
Oh my god, what happened? What just happened? Um, how do I pick up weapons? R? What's R on the...

480
01:42:31,539 --> 01:42:42,600
I don't remember. R. I don't think I ever figured that out. Hold A. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

481
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:51,510
All right, just give me one of your motorcycles.

482
01:43:00,229 --> 01:43:17,539
I'm just trying to go get a hamburger for god's sakes. Please don't. What? Are you kidding me?

483
01:43:17,539 --> 01:43:39,479
Why can I do this? Enable the controller buttons in the settings? Is that in the options? Gamepad

484
01:43:39,479 --> 01:43:48,250
controls? I think that's a mod thing. It should be enabled. I don't know why it's not enabled.

485
01:43:48,250 --> 01:44:04,630
Graphics quality? Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I don't think it's here. It should be just part of the mod.

486
01:44:04,630 --> 01:44:10,550
Enable display. It's not in display. It's in audio. All right.

487
01:44:10,550 --> 01:44:15,210
Yeah, it's in the mod configuration. I thought it was already there. It's okay. I'll be fine.

488
01:44:15,210 --> 01:44:52,329
Fucking idiot. Save game. Yep. There it is. Can I not go in? Will you people leave me alone?

489
01:44:52,329 --> 01:45:11,000
Leave me the fuck alone! Get out of here! I'm just trying to get food. What is that car?

490
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:19,399
It's like a transformer. It's too late? Oh, what time? Okay, what time is it?

491
01:45:22,649 --> 01:45:42,420
Uh, this guy is still in the car. Why are they on my ass so bad? I want to get a hamburger.

492
01:45:42,420 --> 01:46:05,449
Is there a drive-through? Look at the minimap. Oh, drive-through. It's a mission marker? Oh my

493
01:46:05,449 --> 01:46:22,300
God. Hold on. I'm not ready yet. I'm just looking at your menu. You guys served breakfast this late?

494
01:46:35,399 --> 01:46:57,189
Oh shit! Why are people swarming me? Leave me alone. Oh, what's this? This game is really fun.

495
01:46:57,189 --> 01:47:07,369
It's very fun. There's too much to do. Okay, let's do a race. Three, two, one.

496
01:47:08,409 --> 01:47:15,880
Oh, this is not accurate. Everybody crashes into each other in the first one second and only one

497
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:26,739
person's left doing the race. Oh, yeah. Are you fucking kidding me? I didn't know you had to

498
01:47:26,739 --> 01:47:47,539
touch it. I'll make it up. I'll make the time up. Don't worry. Just what? What's handbrake on

499
01:47:47,539 --> 01:47:58,899
controller? Somebody tell me. What is it? Is it Y? It's not Y. It's not B either. Is it B?

500
01:47:59,619 --> 01:48:08,180
It's not B. You fucking liars. What is it? R1? I told you I could make the time up. It's not R1

501
01:48:08,180 --> 01:48:30,659
either. I just turned on cruise control. Okay, left trigger. Thank you. Where's the person in

502
01:48:30,659 --> 01:48:42,970
first place? Come on. There they are. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Crash into somebody.

503
01:48:42,970 --> 01:48:56,819
Crash, crash, crash, crash, crash. Come on. Hit something. Hit anything. Hit somebody.

504
01:49:01,100 --> 01:49:09,670
I had this too. Y is boost. Oh, really? That's pretty cool. Nice. Y is boost. That's cool.

505
01:49:10,550 --> 01:49:18,569
That's a silver. I got the silver. Whatever. All right. Let's actually do a mission now.

506
01:49:18,569 --> 01:49:29,460
What's this? There's a store. Oh, no. I want to see the store. That's pretty sick. I jumped over.

507
01:49:34,859 --> 01:49:48,840
What store is it? What? Well, I got a bike. Oh, it's the doctor. Take that limo. No, I don't want

508
01:49:48,840 --> 01:50:00,789
it. Can I fly with this? Does it push me up? No. Oh, well. All right. It's time to do a mission.

509
01:50:00,789 --> 01:50:13,029
I've been doing nothing for like an hour and a half. No. Yeah. Okay. Here we go. Mission. Go.

510
01:50:13,029 --> 01:50:37,159
I look like I'm asleep. I look like I was asleep. What the fuck is happening? What? Why is it on

511
01:50:37,159 --> 01:51:01,050
fire? Oh, my fucking God. Let's go. How come this isn't on my minimap right now? Waypoint. There we

512
01:51:01,050 --> 01:51:29,109
go. Quick before it explodes. Quick before it explodes. Map can be buggy in this game. Heads up.

513
01:51:29,109 --> 01:51:43,579
Okay. Good to know. I just dove. He wasn't even paying attention either. Can I go in the restaurant

514
01:51:43,579 --> 01:51:52,409
during operating hours? I need to find out. I'm very curious. Can I actually go in here or is it

515
01:51:52,409 --> 01:52:09,079
only a drive-through? Oh, well. It's only drive-through. Oh, your voice makes my balls

516
01:52:09,079 --> 01:52:14,600
ache. I don't I that could be I don't know what that even means. That could go in a bunch of

517
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:27,500
directions. What is that? Is that like liquor? What's this? Alcohol or something? Like drinks?

518
01:52:28,060 --> 01:52:49,510
What is this? It's a pet store? Liquor store? Where's the entrance? When he said, yo, where's

519
01:52:49,510 --> 01:53:00,659
the music? Can't do music. Wait, can I buy a car? Purchase more expensive vehicles at vehicle

520
01:53:00,659 --> 01:53:29,829
dealerships. What a weird way to get off the bike. Oh, oh, come on. 15,000. Oh, compensator. Cool. Can

521
01:53:29,829 --> 01:53:53,270
I hit this guy with the car? 70,000. I think there's extra cars in the mod. Are these extra?

522
01:53:53,270 --> 01:54:12,060
The mod apparently adds a bunch of cards. Very cool. That's cool. What mod is this? This is

523
01:54:12,060 --> 01:54:25,210
gentleman of the row. That's at a different shop. You just call me scrub? No, not worth it. What?

524
01:54:25,210 --> 01:55:01,739
Let's do it. I'm like a melted action figure. You want a beer? Yeah, that'd be great. Juggles

525
01:55:01,739 --> 01:55:16,310
the great. Yo, come to the living room. Don't do that. A bottle opener is like $1.50. You're

526
01:55:16,310 --> 01:55:19,829
going to get hurt. You're going to break it. It's going to cut you. Don't do that. Don't be an idiot.

527
01:55:19,829 --> 01:55:24,329
Or that you're talking. You're going to fuck up your table. We all thought you were dead.

528
01:55:24,329 --> 01:55:29,930
I almost was. Well, for someone who was blown to hell, you look great. Did you do something

529
01:55:29,930 --> 01:55:33,529
with your hair? Yeah, I've been getting that a lot. Yo, can we give it back to business?

530
01:55:34,250 --> 01:55:38,489
What's the rush? I've been cooped up on death row and that bitch has been laid out in a coma.

531
01:55:39,449 --> 01:55:44,489
We definitely need to remind motherfuckers who we are. And that can't wait until after dinner?

532
01:55:44,569 --> 01:55:50,569
No. You two haven't changed at all. Well, you know, there's a saying about dogs and blowing shit up.

533
01:55:51,609 --> 01:55:57,909
So what's the plan? We get our crew together. Once we got that, we can work on our taking back our

534
01:55:57,909 --> 01:56:07,779
city. Sounds good. And where were you planning on having this little meeting? Right here. No.

535
01:56:07,779 --> 01:56:13,220
Well, this place is pretty spacious. No. The color is very soothing. No. Come on,

536
01:56:13,699 --> 01:56:21,130
this ain't no fucking gang clubhouse. Change of plans. We got to find a new place. Yeah.

537
01:56:21,130 --> 01:56:27,880
He sounds like the Geico gecko. See what we do here is what I talk about. It's a commercial.

538
01:56:27,880 --> 01:56:32,439
It's not a commercial though. I'm a real person. I'm treated like a real guy. Geico. I'm a real guy.

539
01:56:32,439 --> 01:56:37,659
I'm not a fucking fake lizard. Did you know that I was me that came up with the idea?

540
01:56:38,779 --> 01:56:43,500
Geico said 15% of all car insurance. I was me a lizard. I'm not real. Even though they treat me

541
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:47,500
like I'm a real person talking to a camera. Like it's like the ad people are there in the room

542
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:50,539
and the cameraman and shit. We got to find a new place. Stop making those.

543
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:56,140
Stop making those. We don't like them. And we're not staying in the mission.

544
01:56:56,140 --> 01:57:00,699
Now check it out. Years ago, an earthquake dropped part of the city below sea level.

545
01:57:00,699 --> 01:57:05,659
And rather than clearing out the rubble, the city just built over. There's an abandoned hotel below

546
01:57:05,659 --> 01:57:10,699
the mission that'll work for us. All right. What's the catch? We got to evict the current tenants.

547
01:57:10,779 --> 01:57:20,970
Sounds like fun. Make more. You're talking about them right now. Yeah, but advertising worked on

548
01:57:20,970 --> 01:57:27,960
you. No, it didn't. I'm completely immune to advertising. See, I'm one of those people that

549
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:43,060
says no ads work on me, which usually means all ads work on me. And I can tell you that ads work

550
01:57:43,859 --> 01:57:46,819
because the amount of times that I've seen stuffed crust pizza ads in my life,

551
01:57:47,539 --> 01:57:52,300
when I was preparing stuffing for Thanksgiving, I wanted a stuffed crust pizza because the word

552
01:57:52,300 --> 01:58:11,689
stuff. They fucked me up for life. For life. Why are you not eating stuffed crust right now?

553
01:58:12,729 --> 01:58:29,079
That's a really good question. But hold on a second. He's okay. He's all right.

554
01:58:32,899 --> 01:58:47,109
We can swim. We're fine. We made it. We don't have a car anymore, but we'll get there.

555
01:58:50,010 --> 01:58:53,289
It was like a coin pusher game. They were right on the edge. I had to push them.

556
01:59:10,010 --> 01:59:22,149
No. All right. I'm fine. Don't you think you wouldn't be wanting to walk over here?

557
01:59:33,319 --> 01:59:36,279
All of you thought it was going to happen again. And I made sure that it wouldn't.

558
01:59:40,569 --> 01:59:44,739
I made damn sure that it was not going to happen again. But I'll tell you right now,

559
01:59:44,739 --> 01:59:54,659
I want this person's car because it's way better. Easy. Easy. No, they got away. What happened?

560
01:59:54,659 --> 02:00:17,960
Okay, here we go. Let's do it. Make your way underground. Do I have enough weapons for this?

561
02:00:21,079 --> 02:00:44,100
Ooh. I'm sorry. I had to do it. I haven't done it in a while. To go underground.

562
02:00:44,100 --> 02:01:08,920
Resident Evil 4 graphics. That's a great game too. Let's flashbang the room first.

563
02:01:08,920 --> 02:01:38,899
That didn't work. Never mind. Where is he? Down there? Hey, what the fuck?

564
02:01:46,779 --> 02:01:49,500
Watch out. Don't run in my line of fire. What are you out of your mind?

565
02:01:57,640 --> 02:02:10,890
How much ammo do I have? You all right? We didn't even get hurt. Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

566
02:02:10,890 --> 02:02:14,090
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You all right? You okay? You okay? You okay? Get up. Get up. Get

567
02:02:14,090 --> 02:02:33,779
up. Tagging? Oh, shit. Nice. Let's go. This is kind of hard with a controller. Shake the spray can?

568
02:02:41,510 --> 02:03:17,130
You got this? Can you handle it? Oh, my God. What just happened? Gun. Nice. Okay. What? Oh,

569
02:03:17,130 --> 02:03:23,029
it's a shotgun now. Wait. No, I want the other gun. Oh, fuck it. I'll use the shotgun. Who cares?

570
02:03:23,029 --> 02:03:32,310
This is my weapon of choice anyways. I'll show you why. Just wait. I'll show you why in a minute.

571
02:03:32,949 --> 02:03:43,159
What are these people? Oh. What was going on? Why did they all get out of there? What was that?

572
02:03:45,079 --> 02:03:49,239
What's going on? Who are these people? They're not bad? I don't know. I saw them get up on

573
02:03:49,239 --> 02:03:59,260
the grass and start running at me. I didn't know. I did not know. I'm sorry. You want to handle this

574
02:03:59,260 --> 02:04:15,770
one? You take care of this one. You get it. I'll get it. You idiot. Oh, my God. Fuck off with this

575
02:04:15,770 --> 02:04:34,890
bullshit. Got him. One more up here. All right. We did it. Destroy the shanties.

576
02:04:37,029 --> 02:05:01,989
We get out of here? What do we have to do? Whoa. Use left control to take someone's human shield

577
02:05:01,989 --> 02:05:06,779
to prevent you from getting hit by Moe's bullets. What? I don't know what that button is. I have no

578
02:05:06,779 --> 02:05:18,710
idea what that button is. My God. How do I do that? Dude. That's no way to act. I'm going to

579
02:05:18,710 --> 02:05:24,300
have to tell you right now. That's no way to act. That's no way to act. I'm sorry. It's not.

580
02:05:24,300 --> 02:05:53,029
Why won't this break? That's no way to act. But how do I do this? Throw someone at it. Okay. I have

581
02:05:53,029 --> 02:05:57,510
to figure out what that button that is. Come here. I'm going to test some stuff on you for a second.

582
02:05:57,510 --> 02:06:09,079
It's not... Wait. You're not actually mad, right? Right bumper? Why? What is control? Left bumper?

583
02:06:10,739 --> 02:06:17,689
Okay. It's left bumper. So hold on. Don't shoot this person. Don't shoot this person. Stop.

584
02:06:17,689 --> 02:06:25,590
Do not. Oh my goodness gracious. Okay. Don't shoot that person. I'm going to fucking be pissed if you

585
02:06:25,590 --> 02:06:44,659
do. Oops. I can't believe you can... It's not like... This is not... We're not playing. Okay.

586
02:06:44,659 --> 02:06:56,680
I have to hold them. Why can't I just kick these? I don't... I can't. I just want to punch them down.

587
02:06:56,680 --> 02:07:02,579
I don't want to throw people into them. You don't stop doing that or I'm actually going to hurt you.

588
02:07:03,220 --> 02:07:23,560
I'll hurt you motherfucker. I will. Don't do that. I've seen too much. What happened? I put the

589
02:07:23,560 --> 02:07:46,630
fucking gun down. Now. Why are we doing this? Is this like another gang? Holy shit. They have

590
02:07:46,630 --> 02:08:02,409
fucking weapons. Hold on. I'm stun locked. Okay. Go. You are gangsters. They're in your hideout.

591
02:08:14,470 --> 02:08:18,380
Oh, you get the safe house. Okay. I see. He studied the blade.

592
02:08:25,319 --> 02:08:46,060
Star Wars kid. I forgot I had the skates on. Okay. Thousand bucks. I get five hundred bucks a day.

593
02:08:46,859 --> 02:09:01,189
Oh, that's cool. Wait. I get to have my own gang? Oh shit. Okay. Seventeen hundred bucks.

594
02:09:01,829 --> 02:09:12,649
Sorry. Let me go in here. Okay. All right. Fill up your respect bar to play this mission. Oh, I can't.

595
02:09:15,020 --> 02:09:22,970
Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. This is a Nickelodeon Nicktoons MLB mod.

596
02:09:25,619 --> 02:09:33,420
More extreme that you do things a better more respect. Okay. All right. So let's do an activity.

597
02:09:33,420 --> 02:09:36,899
This one's the closest. We're going to do this one. Save the game. Yep.

598
02:09:39,529 --> 02:09:49,750
Two percent of the game done. It's not actually right here, right? Oh, this is your garage.

599
02:09:50,869 --> 02:10:21,899
Oh, okay. Oh, tagging mission. Walker comes up. What's that meter on the left?

600
02:10:22,460 --> 02:10:36,470
It's like the boss health meter. What does that mean? Is that my health? That's enemy attention.

601
02:10:37,189 --> 02:10:43,270
Oh, I. Oh, that would make sense then as to why they're coming over here now to kill me. Help me.

602
02:10:43,270 --> 02:11:13,500
Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me. Thank you. What was that? I didn't even want to do that.

603
02:11:26,140 --> 02:11:42,359
Wait. Now all of a sudden she cares. Get me the fuck out of here. Get me out of here.

604
02:11:44,520 --> 02:12:06,250
Oh, don't get hurt from this. Oh, my God. You idiot. Oh, my God. You idiot twice.

605
02:12:06,250 --> 02:12:11,859
Quick, quick, quick, quick. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. What is this? What is this mission?

606
02:12:11,859 --> 02:12:17,130
Thank God you're here. Every second we're talking is one more second of airtime that Zach Johnson

607
02:12:17,130 --> 02:12:23,689
is stealing from me. Oh, you know, that nut job lawyer who gets hard at the idea of a lawsuit.

608
02:12:23,689 --> 02:12:26,890
Lately, he's been crusading against media. He deems to be offensive.

609
02:12:27,529 --> 02:12:31,689
They're gonna be dead when the mission starts. Not really. But the guy makes a big enough ass

610
02:12:31,689 --> 02:12:34,810
out of himself that whenever he pulls some stunt, people listen.

611
02:12:35,369 --> 02:12:40,649
And if people are watching him, they're not watching me. So what do you want me to do?

612
02:12:41,210 --> 02:12:45,210
Get out there and give me something worth covering. The more damage you do,

613
02:12:45,210 --> 02:12:47,689
the longer I can do a live broadcast.

614
02:12:49,050 --> 02:12:58,380
The right way. Cause carnage. Okay. Wait. I have to like do a bunch of shit like for you to like

615
02:12:58,380 --> 02:13:12,539
film it. Okay. I have to give you the fucking content. It doesn't matter what I do. Do I have

616
02:13:12,539 --> 02:13:19,619
to just break stuff? I have to go to a specific area? Cause that crash game was probably at least

617
02:13:19,619 --> 02:13:32,119
a hundred bucks. Uh, that was carnage. I mean, that was, I just broke a bunch of stuff. Do 50,000

618
02:13:32,119 --> 02:13:55,930
property damage. All right. That was so easy. Do it. Get a bonus destroy luxury cards. Wait,

619
02:13:55,930 --> 02:14:13,699
what about in here? Is it explode? Oh, that was not $50,000 in damage. What are you talking

620
02:14:13,779 --> 02:14:43,350
about? That was an entire gas station. All right. Cool. Get new missions now, right? I still want

621
02:14:43,350 --> 02:14:48,359
to figure out what this actually is. I see all these bottles. I need to investigate. What does

622
02:14:48,359 --> 02:15:04,789
this mean? Okay. So it's a little store. Does that get me in trouble? Oh no. Who let the mayhem guy

623
02:15:04,789 --> 02:15:22,170
in here? It does get me in trouble. Okay. I do get in trouble. I get in trouble. I didn't even

624
02:15:22,170 --> 02:15:31,560
touch this guy. I'm trying to pick him up. How do I pick up people? You're a hippo that got into a

625
02:15:31,560 --> 02:16:07,909
store. I didn't even rob the register. Oh, I can do another mission. Put that on the map. I can

626
02:16:07,909 --> 02:16:16,569
go here or I can go down here. What's this stronghold mission? Uh, this one's closer to

627
02:16:16,569 --> 02:16:29,210
this one. There's so much to do. This is ridiculous. No, I have three stars. How many stars can you get

628
02:16:29,210 --> 02:16:49,670
max in this game? Six. Five. I can't. I hate. I don't want to do it, but you make me do it when

629
02:16:49,670 --> 02:17:22,170
you say it. Holy shit. Scared me. Oops. Am I closer? Plus two dying joke. I know. Didn't you

630
02:17:22,170 --> 02:17:41,219
yell about? I could hear you yell about from all the way over here. Door cut? Maybe. I think it's

631
02:17:41,219 --> 02:17:55,049
up. Do I have to go on the highway? Come on, GPS. What the hell are you doing? Yeah. We'll take a

632
02:17:55,049 --> 02:18:22,739
pee break in a minute. Doi, doi, doi, doi. Why is the GPS keep changing? Where is it? Stop. Why?

633
02:18:22,739 --> 02:18:43,190
This GPS is not even on a road. What is this GPS telling me to do? What? I have to go underground.

634
02:18:44,329 --> 02:19:02,309
Oh, hold on. Tag mission. Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake,

635
02:19:02,309 --> 02:19:06,969
more Aaron. No, I don't. You want to see more Aaron, just go watch Attack on Titan dub. It

636
02:19:06,969 --> 02:19:28,299
happens every other episode. I love it. Dub an entire episode. I don't know. That's not

637
02:19:28,299 --> 02:19:40,540
happening. This is literally all the game just fucking crashed. Shit. What was the last time

638
02:19:40,540 --> 02:19:51,030
I saved it? It was pretty, it was pretty recent. I'll go pee. Yeah. We'll take a pee break. This is

639
02:19:51,030 --> 02:19:55,750
a good time to take a break right after the last mission. That's all right. I'll be fine.

640
02:19:55,750 --> 02:21:29,079
Pee break. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. All right. Now I'm actually BRB. I want to make

641
02:21:29,079 --> 02:25:52,620
sure I can load the game back in. Be right back. I'm telling you. Ever since I got this 3090,

642
02:25:53,590 --> 02:26:01,930
this room is 10 degrees hotter than it was before. It just is. I could be playing minesweeper. It

643
02:26:01,930 --> 02:26:12,420
doesn't matter. Bathroom break joke. Where were you? Oh, I'm just taking a break. I'm just taking

644
02:26:12,420 --> 02:26:27,959
a break. Whatever. What? I was looking at my tweets and I don't know what the fuck was going

645
02:26:27,959 --> 02:26:36,520
on in Thanksgiving. I really don't. I can read you some of the drafts if you'd like. I didn't post

646
02:26:36,520 --> 02:26:44,340
any of these. I don't know why, but maybe I do know why. Okay. Let's see. The first one that's

647
02:26:44,340 --> 02:26:54,889
in the drafts is, I accidentally threw away the wrapper to my little turkey breast I got.

648
02:26:54,889 --> 02:27:00,360
Is it 30, 40 minutes in the microwave? I didn't post it. I don't know. I don't understand why.

649
02:27:01,899 --> 02:27:08,739
An empty M&M's packet smells like someone shit in your bathroom 30 minutes ago. That's true,

650
02:27:08,739 --> 02:27:16,739
but I don't know why I didn't post that one either. And then I put pumpkin pie in F tier

651
02:27:16,739 --> 02:27:22,889
two weeks ago. I just had it for the first time in years. I want to travel back in time and snap

652
02:27:22,889 --> 02:27:35,829
that motherfucker's neck. All these I wrote, but I didn't post. I don't know why. But wouldn't that

653
02:27:35,829 --> 02:27:49,540
kill me? That would kill like future me. Okay. But yeah, I had pumpkin pie and it was unbelievably

654
02:27:49,540 --> 02:28:03,100
good. And by the way, the empty M&M's packet thing, go do it. Go do it. We'll see. Eat a little

655
02:28:03,100 --> 02:28:10,579
packet of M&M's and then wait. Smell the wrapper. Inside. It's as if somebody's shit in your fucking

656
02:28:10,579 --> 02:28:19,500
house and like almost an hour has gone by, but it's still kind of there. Yeah. None of these,

657
02:28:19,500 --> 02:28:24,280
none of these hit hard for me. I don't know why. No tweets ever do. I always write a tweet and I

658
02:28:24,280 --> 02:28:31,930
go, nah, I don't care. I open up Twitter once every month or two to make a tweet. I write the

659
02:28:31,930 --> 02:28:41,219
tweet and then before I post it, I say, I don't care about this shit and I delete it. The microwave

660
02:28:41,219 --> 02:28:45,620
one is a banger. Well, I also maybe didn't want people to think that I was actually doing that.

661
02:28:46,100 --> 02:28:51,370
Blow up my house, right? I don't want people that like, even though I fuck around a lot,

662
02:28:51,370 --> 02:29:03,340
people still think that that I'm like serious classic, but it's funny. Yeah. Well, I just read

663
02:29:03,340 --> 02:29:15,420
them to you. Now it's okay. We know you do that. Please read. This is very important.

664
02:29:15,420 --> 02:29:18,700
I've sent one of your videos to a girl I've been talking to and she stopped talking to me. Is that

665
02:29:18,700 --> 02:29:31,639
what you said? I can't scroll up, but what are you doing? Okay. Let's go. I'm ready. I hope this

666
02:29:31,639 --> 02:29:45,450
captures the capturing. Customize your crib here to gain style points. Ooh. Oh shit. Okay.

667
02:29:46,090 --> 02:30:04,729
2000. What about pimp pad? Ooh, I like this. It's 4,000. I'll save up for it.

668
02:30:04,729 --> 02:30:10,500
You're my auto Lala. You don't even like that video. You hated that until I did it like three

669
02:30:10,500 --> 02:30:15,379
times and then I somehow like brainwashed you all. I've like brainwashed all of you to think that

670
02:30:15,379 --> 02:30:20,899
some of these things are funny. Isn't that weird how that happened? I said Aaron one time in that

671
02:30:20,899 --> 02:30:26,739
voice and everyone freaked out and said, I don't fucking do that ever again. I did it like 35,000

672
02:30:26,739 --> 02:30:31,059
more times and now everybody wants it every stream. I did the Lala dog thing and everyone was like,

673
02:30:31,700 --> 02:30:36,069
stop doing that. It's cringe. It sucks. You probably watched the video and now you want me

674
02:30:36,069 --> 02:30:45,270
to do it every stream. Doy, doy, doy. I did that once and people, I saw like the stop, stop,

675
02:30:45,270 --> 02:30:55,209
nay, nay, no, no, no emotes. All right. Let's go. I'm just stirring up my iced coffee. Don't drop

676
02:30:55,209 --> 02:31:09,379
that. This is a repeat episode. They're all repeats. Understand? It's these are all repeats.

677
02:31:09,379 --> 02:31:12,709
I can do a home theater. I don't have any money to even care about this right now.

678
02:31:18,790 --> 02:31:27,420
Don't leave. Okay. Missions didn't play zombie uprising. It's too much going on. Wait,

679
02:31:27,420 --> 02:31:45,860
I want to play zombie uprising. No, I don't like this. Okay. Let me explain. Super Nintendo

680
02:31:46,500 --> 02:31:53,299
switch. Nintendo is burned in my brain. The B button on Nintendo, the back button is where the

681
02:31:53,299 --> 02:32:06,889
A button is on the Xbox. It's A on Xbox is like, yes, do this thing. But that's B on Nintendo. And

682
02:32:06,889 --> 02:32:14,760
I, it's ever since I was 15, 12, 11, doesn't matter. 10. This is a, I, that's not, they gotta

683
02:32:14,760 --> 02:32:21,750
get on something here. They gotta be on the same page. Cause I'm, I'm right now it's crossed up,

684
02:32:21,750 --> 02:32:27,370
confirm and back because they're flipped on the different consoles. Who cares? Then I want that.

685
02:32:27,370 --> 02:32:31,129
I don't want to see the person's name ever again. If I see it again, I'm going to fucking,

686
02:32:31,129 --> 02:32:39,670
I'm going to throw, I'm just throwing up thinking about that person. Okay. No, let's go. No, I want

687
02:32:39,670 --> 02:33:03,959
to stop the zombie assault. Is this part of the mod? I think this is the mod. Um, what's one,

688
02:33:03,959 --> 02:33:18,870
which, what is one, what button on the controller is one. I don't know what button it is. Is there

689
02:33:18,870 --> 02:33:27,540
a weapon? How do I get out? How do I leave the game? Just kill me. I don't care. This is fun,

690
02:33:27,540 --> 02:33:42,090
but whatever. Also having to hit back and then confirm the back instead of pressing back twice.

691
02:33:42,090 --> 02:33:47,209
You know what I mean? You get it. You guys get it. I know you do. Is your stash. Ooh,

692
02:33:47,209 --> 02:33:59,579
take money. Should I put, should I put money in the stash and people steal from me or rob me or

693
02:33:59,579 --> 02:34:05,559
something? All right. I need to do this mayhem mission again, because that's where we left off.

694
02:34:05,559 --> 02:34:20,700
This one's a hundred thousand. I can definitely do it. That's passive income. Oh, that's cool.

695
02:34:32,709 --> 02:35:05,129
Oh, shit. I forgot about this. Let me try a few in his drink. Not quite. Oh, come on. It's

696
02:35:05,129 --> 02:35:13,930
right there. Let me just do this, please. Okay. Here we go. No, wait. I, this is for the video.

697
02:35:46,139 --> 02:35:55,340
Am I asleep? I don't know. You might be. How do you type that if you're asleep? You make no sense.

698
02:35:55,340 --> 02:36:16,709
Ban that person. No music. All right. Well, we need to have other music then. Cause I can't

699
02:36:16,709 --> 02:36:29,719
play the one that's on here. I'm not playing Kevin McLeod. No thanks. He's really, really,

700
02:36:30,360 --> 02:36:35,639
he's got, he's really talented, really great. Did awesome shit for the entire YouTube community.

701
02:36:35,639 --> 02:36:40,200
When all the people were like, what are we going to do for music? It's great. It's awesome. But I

702
02:36:40,200 --> 02:36:46,309
don't want to listen to it. Like what, what a hero. What an absolute fucking just may gave everybody

703
02:36:46,309 --> 02:37:05,020
music to use. Wait, hold on. It's blocking me. Why is this bench that much stronger than the other

704
02:37:05,020 --> 02:37:26,309
benches? This is the strap right here. They just respawn. No, they don't. My whole face is itchy.

705
02:37:26,309 --> 02:37:48,840
Hold on. What the fuck is happening? Hey, good. I got two minutes to do this. I got it.

706
02:37:51,379 --> 02:38:11,190
This is the slowest fucking car I could possibly use to do this. Come on, break it. Oh God,

707
02:38:11,190 --> 02:38:43,659
whatever. Stop. Just get up here. I just have to get a car. Why did I even get out of that car?

708
02:38:43,659 --> 02:38:55,370
Use grenades. I have grenades. Don't make any sudden moves. Oh my God. I have grenades. You're

709
02:38:55,370 --> 02:39:08,489
right. Oh fuck. I'm down. That's your fault. I blame you for that shit. I blame you for that. I

710
02:39:08,489 --> 02:39:28,950
don't know. I freaked out. I'm doing it again. I blame you for that. I really do. This is so much

711
02:39:28,950 --> 02:39:36,459
easy. This is easy with just grenades. This is like too easy doing this. Just breaking stuff.

712
02:39:38,620 --> 02:39:51,219
How am I so fat? I have a mod. Don't run into the grenade. You idiot. This is a cheap strategy.

713
02:39:53,340 --> 02:39:59,690
Yeah, I just put in the cheat codes in GTA and just went to the rocket launcher and then I got

714
02:39:59,690 --> 02:40:07,059
bored. You know what I mean? I got bored. Fuck. I did the cheat codes and I took out the rocket

715
02:40:07,059 --> 02:40:17,260
launcher. The game's no longer fun anymore. Use the true meta. Drive over fences. I'll try that.

716
02:40:17,260 --> 02:40:38,889
I don't want to throw this. I got two minutes to get to 10,000. Don't ever get on a motorcycle

717
02:40:38,889 --> 02:40:55,079
ever again, Jeremy. Seriously, what are you doing? Let's try fence strat. I mean, fence strat is

718
02:40:55,079 --> 02:41:18,739
perfect. That's actually a great strategy. I got it. Who is she shooting at? 250. That's it.

719
02:41:31,510 --> 02:41:34,389
Okay. Save the game. Let's try this again. Hopefully it doesn't crash again.

720
02:41:34,950 --> 02:41:56,309
I will be sad if this crashes again. That's literally right here. I don't think I've

721
02:41:56,309 --> 02:42:02,920
blinked in two hours. Has that ever happened to you guys where you finally end up blinking

722
02:42:02,920 --> 02:42:40,469
a couple times and your eyes are hurt and they're watery? Shake the can. Hurry up. Hurry up. Okay.

723
02:42:40,469 --> 02:42:48,620
Game is saved. Don't crash. Please don't crash. Don't crash. Yes. We're good.

724
02:43:13,610 --> 02:43:15,290
These guys are bad guys. These people are awful.

725
02:43:19,450 --> 02:43:23,610
You said it yourself. Most of the old crew are either dead or busted by Troy.

726
02:43:23,610 --> 02:43:27,370
We're going to have to start fresh. Yeah. Well, let's get on that because I'm done mopping up

727
02:43:27,370 --> 02:43:32,569
blood. That's the point. Yeah, no shit. It seems all right, but we're going to need more. What's

728
02:43:32,569 --> 02:43:37,610
you thinking? Yo, I met some people in jail who might work. Let me make some calls. Once I find

729
02:43:37,610 --> 02:43:40,569
out where these bitches are, you're going to have to show them that you're the real deal though.

730
02:43:40,569 --> 02:43:46,729
They won't just follow anybody. It won't be a problem. Hey, before you go, what sort of crew

731
02:43:46,729 --> 02:43:55,959
are you looking for? I'm looking for people that are strong, smart, can work on the fly,

732
02:43:56,760 --> 02:44:16,299
who know right from wrong, integrity, the ability to cook large meals,

733
02:44:17,020 --> 02:44:22,069
feed everybody because how are we going to do that? I don't know how to cook. We're going to

734
02:44:22,069 --> 02:44:25,590
have like 50 people in this. This is what happens when you just talk and you don't play video games.

735
02:44:30,280 --> 02:44:37,690
Okay. But yeah, like seriously, we're going to have like 50 people in the crew in the same place.

736
02:44:38,489 --> 02:44:43,209
We have to have like catering. One of the first people has to be a caterer in the group.

737
02:44:43,209 --> 02:45:07,430
That's important. Like a tax attorney, right? These are all things you need. Pharmacy, a pharmacist.

738
02:45:07,430 --> 02:45:41,399
Yeah, I would join the gang if it had a caterer. You need to have, if I was going to have a gang,

739
02:45:41,399 --> 02:46:01,670
I'd want to have like a couple of teachers, two or three doctors. I'm not even describing

740
02:46:01,670 --> 02:46:06,870
a gang at this point. I'm describing like your neighbor, like your neighbors, like a community.

741
02:46:07,750 --> 02:46:12,010
It's not even, this is just like, oh yeah, that's just like a community of people.

742
02:46:12,569 --> 02:46:16,969
We have like a few, we have doctors, we have nurses, we have workers, we have like,

743
02:46:16,969 --> 02:46:26,979
this is just like houses. What am I talking about? I'm not even describing a gang. I'm describing

744
02:46:27,540 --> 02:46:33,000
like, I'm describing like a YMCA. You know what I mean? Like, oh yeah, we've got like a gym,

745
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:51,139
we've got like people like, we've got doctors, we've got nurses, we've got a pool, play the game.

746
02:46:51,139 --> 02:47:00,260
Fuck, I'm sorry. I know, I know, you know it. Oh, is he okay? Is he okay? Please get his money.

747
02:47:00,260 --> 02:47:05,180
Where are you going? I don't know. I'm not paying attention. This is what happens. I just start

748
02:47:05,180 --> 02:47:11,639
talking and I just drive in circles. Please bear with me. Well, I have to go to the one over here.

749
02:47:12,200 --> 02:47:33,459
Just take your time. All right, I don't know what the mission is. Is the mission to kill this

750
02:47:33,459 --> 02:47:46,840
person? Is the mission to recruit this person? Are you a caterer? You've experienced anything

751
02:47:46,840 --> 02:48:00,709
like Italian Mediterranean food? Because that's what I want to have. You're not a chef. Do you

752
02:48:00,709 --> 02:48:15,270
know any chefs? Oops. Do you want stuff to crust? I have to go off the jump? What jump?

753
02:48:15,670 --> 02:48:30,040
Are you impressed? Are you impressed? That was pretty crazy, wasn't it? Well, what's with this

754
02:48:30,040 --> 02:48:38,219
gigantic blob here? Well, how do I have to go? Okay, I get it. I'm just driving to the indicator.

755
02:48:38,219 --> 02:48:44,899
Follow me. We'll do it on a motorcycle and then I guarantee you're going to die.

756
02:48:45,909 --> 02:49:01,159
Just to make sure we're all aware of this. It's almost like I would put my arms around you to

757
02:49:01,159 --> 02:49:14,809
hold on, but I can't. Where the fuck is this? I don't understand what I have to do here.

758
02:49:15,530 --> 02:49:33,989
I have to jump that? Oh, is there a right there? Okay. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. We're good.

759
02:49:46,280 --> 02:50:05,110
Get the fuck out of the way. Are we good? Do you care? Are we friends? We're still alive. That's

760
02:50:05,110 --> 02:50:17,739
good. So there's three more jumps to hit. Follow me. What? Oh, wait. I don't know how much more

761
02:50:17,739 --> 02:50:30,549
of this. Is she injured? Okay. Where's this next one? Just get it on the map. Here we finally.

762
02:50:30,549 --> 02:50:43,879
Okay. What just happened? I don't know. All right. All right. All right. All right. It's right there.

763
02:50:45,620 --> 02:51:09,319
Is it this mound? Did I count? It didn't count. Good times. Good times.

764
02:51:17,700 --> 02:51:25,879
Oh, sorry. I was trying to kill her. I was just trying to dump her and now I have to do this

765
02:51:25,879 --> 02:51:33,129
again. I'm so fucking sorry. I'm actually sorry. I didn't really, I did not think it was going to

766
02:51:33,129 --> 02:51:43,100
kill me. I thought I was going to kill her. Oh fuck. Whatever. I'm sorry. It wasn't even worth it.

767
02:51:43,100 --> 02:51:45,579
I thought it was going to just, the car is going to blow up or something. I don't know.

768
02:51:49,420 --> 02:51:57,750
I'll get it really quick right now. I promise. Don't leave. Stay. If I don't finish this mission

769
02:51:58,389 --> 02:52:03,750
in the next hour, like this one right here, to get the three jumps, like this, just with her to

770
02:52:03,750 --> 02:52:12,569
jump over the three jumps, just this part of this mission here, an hour, I will give 500 trillion

771
02:52:12,569 --> 02:52:25,860
community subs. Just this part here would just go to the three jumps. That's it. There's this, this,

772
02:52:26,180 --> 02:52:39,129
section of this mission. I have an hour. God, I hope my power doesn't go up.

773
02:52:42,059 --> 02:52:45,100
Why am I freaking out? I have an hour to do a mission that takes 10 seconds.

774
02:52:45,739 --> 02:52:52,809
Oh, by the way, by the way, if, even if my power goes out, if I, if I do it,

775
02:52:52,809 --> 02:52:55,930
it doesn't matter. Even if like the stream turns off, it doesn't fucking matter. I can do it here.

776
02:52:57,450 --> 02:53:05,719
Just this part right here, this one, that's it. Just do the jumps. I didn't say it had to be on

777
02:53:05,719 --> 02:53:11,559
screen, by the way. I just had to say I had to do it in an hour. By the way, I could literally,

778
02:53:11,559 --> 02:53:14,120
I'm just going to, if my power goes out or something, I'm literally going to go download

779
02:53:14,120 --> 02:53:25,350
this on the switch and play it in my bathroom and just do it and do it. So it counts. Get on. Quick.

780
02:53:27,989 --> 02:53:40,229
I'm not fucking around. I can't right now, even if it's impossible to lose.

781
02:53:41,190 --> 02:54:12,889
That counts. I did. Yep. Good. Cool. There's no reason for me to freak out about this. I have

782
02:54:12,889 --> 02:54:21,430
plenty of time. And I know somebody probably going to say, no, I did not say an hour in dog years.

783
02:54:22,229 --> 02:55:10,250
An hour in human years. There's two. Oh my God. All right. I'm done. I got it. Mission complete.

784
02:55:16,659 --> 02:55:32,340
I did it. It's been completed. I can't redrive from checkpoint. I can't redrive.

785
02:55:32,340 --> 02:55:40,809
It's done. She's good. We did it. It's over. I'm done. That section wasn't complete. Even if I died,

786
02:55:40,809 --> 02:55:46,569
it doesn't matter. That section was already complete. Look, I told you just that section.

787
02:55:46,569 --> 02:56:14,920
It was very clear. I would like a new weapon, special thrown flash bangs. That's so expensive.

788
02:56:14,920 --> 02:56:30,360
Why don't I just buy that? That's stupid. I think it's 2000 too much. This is too expensive.

789
02:56:30,360 --> 02:56:54,379
300 bucks. Dude. Double or nothing. Double or nothing. No, no double or nothing. It's over.

790
02:56:55,180 --> 02:57:15,420
Oh, that cross sucks. Nevermind. Oh, what am I doing? Let's go. We'll go right here.

791
02:57:15,420 --> 02:57:27,620
Double or nothing. That's stupid. There's so many old people here. Everybody's old. All right. What

792
02:57:27,620 --> 02:57:56,090
do you want me to do? You got it. Get in the car. I made this very easy. Oh, hey, what the

793
02:57:56,090 --> 02:58:00,170
fuck are you doing? Why did you? What would you do that for? Why would you do that? I don't want you

794
02:58:00,170 --> 02:58:04,489
on the team. I don't want you. I don't want you part of the guild or whatever this is. I know

795
02:58:04,489 --> 02:58:14,649
that was stupid. What you did was dumb and now we're in trouble. No, I'm kicking you from the

796
02:58:14,649 --> 02:58:37,079
guild. Help me. You took the cop hostage. Who is this? No, no, no, no, no. Where's the crowbar?

797
02:58:37,079 --> 02:58:58,170
How'd you get a crowbar? I want that. Where are you going? Okay. Let's get the fuck out of here.

798
02:58:58,170 --> 02:59:42,860
Wait, it's over here. We're going to sneak up on them. Where are they? Where are they? What do

799
02:59:42,860 --> 02:59:52,389
you think about that? What do you think about that one? Don't fall off. Although it'd be kind

800
02:59:52,389 --> 03:00:26,969
of funny if you did. Is that going to kill him? He's blazed. What? Wait, hold on. Does this reset

801
03:00:26,969 --> 03:00:41,479
the mission if he falls? Does it? I don't think it will. Oh my god, he's fine and he can't even

802
03:00:41,479 --> 03:00:48,329
fall off this. Oh, whatever. I'm gone. Why do you guys think I'm zonked? What are you talking about?

803
03:00:48,329 --> 03:01:04,569
How am I zonked? I told you I was drinking coffee. There's one more person this way.

804
03:01:04,569 --> 03:01:33,139
What kind of coffee? An iced coffee. Let's go. An iced coffee. Busy. I made it myself.

805
03:01:34,500 --> 03:01:39,940
Well, I couldn't let my boyfriend. You know, a guy from jail. You know, it's like 7 p.m. where I am.

806
03:01:39,940 --> 03:01:44,899
It's 5 20. He's happy enough when he's killing somebody. You don't drink coffee up to 6 p.m.

807
03:01:44,899 --> 03:01:51,219
Seriously. That's it. I got enough to go till 6. Brew your own coffee? Well, I mean, yeah.

808
03:01:55,940 --> 03:01:59,780
Would you guys like to know the best beans of coffee to use for any occasion?

809
03:02:00,420 --> 03:02:10,309
You want me to tell you? I will. It's nothing fancy. It's nothing like, oh wow, you got those

810
03:02:10,389 --> 03:02:16,389
beans from some random plant. You imported them from a different country. No. The Illy coffee

811
03:02:16,389 --> 03:02:22,549
beans are the best. They just are. Without a doubt. S plus tier. They do everything. Hot coffee.

812
03:02:22,549 --> 03:02:33,239
Fantastic. They do iced coffee. Fantastic. Illy. It's in a little tin. A little tin can. That's the

813
03:02:33,239 --> 03:02:37,719
best coffee beans you can possibly buy. If you're not drinking Illy, here's what's going to happen.

814
03:02:37,719 --> 03:02:40,760
You're going to drink Illy for a little while and be like, oh, this is perfect. What a perfect cup

815
03:02:40,760 --> 03:02:45,000
of fucking coffee. And then you're going to drink something else and go, oh, this is, this is good.

816
03:02:45,000 --> 03:02:48,360
This is okay. You're going to pretend to like it. You're going to get like an expensive coffee

817
03:02:48,360 --> 03:02:51,959
and pretend to enjoy it because you want to seem like you know what you're talking about.

818
03:02:53,979 --> 03:02:58,620
Then you're going to eventually go back to Illy and say, yeah, why did I ever leave? There's no

819
03:02:58,620 --> 03:03:12,299
reason to. All right. Back at the, oh, I have to tell this. It's just a really good, nice, smooth

820
03:03:12,299 --> 03:03:21,020
cup of coffee. Illy. I-L-L-Y. I think. Coffee snob, Andy. You can get this at any grocery store.

821
03:03:21,659 --> 03:03:32,620
How do I pick this up? I don't want to hurt this person. Oh my God. I'm running over stuff.

822
03:03:34,100 --> 03:03:42,389
Left control. And what is it? I don't have no idea what those buttons are. There it is.

823
03:03:42,950 --> 03:03:45,290
Okay. Hold until the vehicle is there.

824
03:03:57,530 --> 03:04:08,309
Okay. Yeah, no, I'm not sponsored to say that. No. Illy coffee beans does not sponsor,

825
03:04:08,309 --> 03:04:30,540
they don't sponsor people. I, I'm just telling you what I truly believe. That's it. How do you

826
03:04:30,540 --> 03:04:40,950
grind the beans? Grinder. Freshest cup of coffee you can get is when you grind beans. Grind your

827
03:04:40,950 --> 03:04:48,889
beans, put it right in after grinding. That was on purpose, but it wasn't somehow.

828
03:04:49,690 --> 03:05:02,920
I didn't, I have, whatever. I'm using the car as a, what the fuck are you doing? I didn't press

829
03:05:02,920 --> 03:05:13,639
that. I didn't press that. I promise I didn't press that button. What kind of roast is it?

830
03:05:13,639 --> 03:05:26,500
I think it's just a, oh, the goddamn game crashed. God damn it. Are you kidding me? No. Oh no.

831
03:05:28,840 --> 03:05:40,889
Wait, the timer? Wait, hold on. How long has it been? No, that counts because I did it and

832
03:05:40,969 --> 03:06:00,440
you say it was completed on the stream. Uh, oh fuck. What? Are you kidding me? That's such

833
03:06:00,440 --> 03:06:06,229
horse shit. All right. I have to start to save after every single thing I do now.

834
03:06:06,950 --> 03:06:31,239
Now I'm actually concerned about this. Yes, it does count. You have 45 minutes left. Stop

835
03:06:31,239 --> 03:07:00,409
fucking around and go. Hurry. Oh, please. Tap the game's FPS to 10. I don't think I want to do that.

836
03:07:00,409 --> 03:07:10,809
Turn cheats on. No, I've never experienced this game before. I'm not going right to the cheats.

837
03:07:11,450 --> 03:07:17,059
I'm enjoying Saints Row 2, the video game, as it was intended by the video game's development.

838
03:07:24,219 --> 03:07:28,549
I think it's running pretty good. I mean, it's a little chunky sometimes, but I think it's fine.

839
03:07:29,190 --> 03:07:35,379
I swear, what roast? Please. Um, I think it was just the just the standard roast. Just the

840
03:07:35,379 --> 03:07:42,059
regular roast. It's the red can. Ili has like three or four different cans. It's the one that's the

841
03:07:42,059 --> 03:07:52,379
red can. That's the red letters. No, it's not roast beef. It's just standard roast. I don't know

842
03:07:52,379 --> 03:08:04,120
what that I don't know. How do you not know the can? It's your favorite coffee. I don't I don't

843
03:08:04,120 --> 03:08:09,479
know. It's whatever it is. It's like breakfast roast, regular roast, yum roast, eat roast,

844
03:08:10,200 --> 03:08:14,600
pork roast. It doesn't matter. The coffee is good. It's the red can. Just buy the red can.

845
03:08:24,219 --> 03:08:27,899
You know what they do? They have an espresso blend too. And that's also good. I've had that

846
03:08:27,899 --> 03:08:51,690
one before. Holy shit. Ili is owned by Folgers. Okay, wait a minute before. Oh, no, it's owned

847
03:08:51,690 --> 03:08:57,610
by Folgers. It's a Folgers coffee. Oh, no. You mean the thing that you can go get a fucking tub of

848
03:08:57,610 --> 03:09:04,139
it. It's literally like the cheapest like you can get a whole tub of Folgers for probably less than

849
03:09:04,139 --> 03:09:09,379
10 bucks. It'll last you like three months. Sometimes coffee is just coffee. And that's all

850
03:09:09,379 --> 03:09:14,340
you need. You don't have like, look, I Okay, oh, I'd like a cappuccino. I'll take a macchiato,

851
03:09:14,340 --> 03:09:20,979
please. Yeah, but just a regular just cup of coffee in your coffee maker. Who cares? It's not

852
03:09:20,979 --> 03:09:25,700
look, you can get some nice stuff if you want. But on a day to day basis, stop shooting at people.

853
03:09:25,700 --> 03:09:39,319
Why? I actually like Folger. I don't think Folgers is bad. It's just regular just regular coffee,

854
03:09:39,319 --> 03:09:48,200
just diner coffee. That's not a problem. Look, some coffees are kind of gross, even like the

855
03:09:48,200 --> 03:09:56,459
really nice expensive ones. Get out of the car quick. Please get out of the car. Get out of the

856
03:09:56,459 --> 03:10:11,049
car. Get away from for explodes. Thank you. Support your local coffee roasters. There's actually a few

857
03:10:11,049 --> 03:10:17,350
that are really good out here. I've had but it's just in your cupboard. Just coffee. It's just you

858
03:10:17,430 --> 03:10:27,479
can just it's always there. It's always available. By the way, I did it. See? Done. No, I didn't have

859
03:10:27,479 --> 03:10:42,620
three more to do. Shit. Not sponsored by the way. I'm not why why would I be sponsored by a coffee

860
03:10:42,620 --> 03:10:48,680
company? But I've what I'm just not going to announce that I have like a major new sponsorship.

861
03:10:48,680 --> 03:11:05,340
I'm just gonna say bye. You need to buy Italy. When I have to disclose that for the fucking

862
03:11:05,340 --> 03:11:13,530
FAA regulations or whatever. It's good times. Whenever you're getting everyone together. Let

863
03:11:13,530 --> 03:11:29,049
me know. I'd love to roll with you guys. Okay, save it. You're safe. We're good. Now please get

864
03:11:29,049 --> 03:11:42,360
out of the way so I don't hurt you. We're good. I love Italy. Yeah, it's very it's really good.

865
03:11:43,000 --> 03:11:48,729
I've had a lot of coffee in my life. And it's probably the best one that I've had. That's just

866
03:11:48,729 --> 03:11:53,379
a regular good cup of coffee. There's nothing else I need to say to you. I don't need to prove

867
03:11:53,379 --> 03:12:10,860
that it's good coffee. Just get it. I have to prove it. I'm gonna run with you. I want to see

868
03:12:11,659 --> 03:12:20,469
Well, what would you guys consider as good coffee to have is beans or ground? What do you buy?

869
03:12:21,030 --> 03:12:27,780
If it's not illy? What is it? Folgers? What is it? Folgers? Yeah, what's wrong with that?

870
03:12:28,420 --> 03:12:32,340
I'm seeing a lot of Folgers and a lot of you are Folgers haters for some reason.

871
03:12:33,540 --> 03:12:59,719
Costco brand? That's good too. Trader Joe's? That's good too. Good. Starbucks? No, if I'm

872
03:12:59,719 --> 03:13:08,250
going to buy coffee, it's not going to be Starbucks beans. It just isn't. Buying Starbucks beans is not

873
03:13:09,129 --> 03:13:14,299
No, you can just go to Starbucks and get it. There's Starbucks in every fucking one mile.

874
03:13:14,299 --> 03:13:17,659
It's not like special. You can't there's no like Folgers you can get.

875
03:13:18,299 --> 03:13:21,500
Now like I'm going to go to the Folgers store and get a Folgers from the Folgers cafe.

876
03:13:22,139 --> 03:13:53,270
No, I actually don't really even like Starbucks coffee that much. It's okay. Nice. Meet me at the

877
03:13:53,270 --> 03:14:18,040
abandoned mission house. I'll be there. He's trying to dodge him. Thank you. Why buy Starbucks beans?

878
03:14:18,040 --> 03:14:25,940
You can just go and get it from the store for 10 times more. Yeah, okay. I understand. I know. I

879
03:14:25,940 --> 03:14:31,319
understand what you mean. But there is something to be said about having being somewhere out

880
03:14:31,319 --> 03:14:37,110
somewhere. It's like, you know what? Yeah, I'll take a coffee. I'll take a nice iced coffee.

881
03:14:38,739 --> 03:14:49,909
It's nice. Sometimes you just want to have like be holding around a coffee while you're walking

882
03:14:49,909 --> 03:14:58,809
around just hanging out. Iced coffee is better from a cafe. It usually is. It's really difficult

883
03:14:58,809 --> 03:15:04,329
to make an iced coffee at home that's actually as good as like a cafe. And I know I haven't figured

884
03:15:04,329 --> 03:15:12,139
out why. I don't get it. I've tried everything. The iced coffee I make is really good. But it's

885
03:15:12,139 --> 03:15:26,950
not the same. Get loads of sugar. No, I don't get. I don't put sugar in my coffee. Not usually. Maybe

886
03:15:26,950 --> 03:15:33,670
like one. I don't put them in sugar in a coffee. I usually drink hot coffee black and iced coffee

887
03:15:33,670 --> 03:15:45,819
with almond milk or oat milk and maybe like one pump of some syrup or something. But I can't

888
03:15:45,819 --> 03:16:00,200
replicate it at home. That person went through the windshield. Holy shit. My brother's been looking

889
03:16:00,200 --> 03:16:02,760
for a good recipe. I missed that. What did they say? My brother's looking for a good recipe?

890
03:16:03,479 --> 03:16:09,510
I missed that. Somebody said my brother's looking for a good recipe for something. I

891
03:16:09,510 --> 03:16:23,940
didn't see what it was. Oh my god. Damn it. Just fucking go. That guy walked into the car.

892
03:16:23,940 --> 03:16:31,159
That was not even my fault. Where the fuck is the car?

893
03:16:54,920 --> 03:17:00,280
Did you have a car on the back like a bicycle? Enough about coffee. Are we talking about this

894
03:17:00,280 --> 03:17:12,120
too long? I'm really worried if you drive like this in real life. I don't drive like this. This

895
03:17:12,120 --> 03:17:21,459
is a video game. You don't drive a car with an analog stick and in a cartoon video game universe.

896
03:17:22,100 --> 03:17:47,510
The hell is about your Civic? Don't distract me right now. Do an IRL driving stream. No,

897
03:17:47,510 --> 03:18:00,219
why would I do that? I don't want to do that. Why would I do that? This is getting ridiculous.

898
03:18:06,940 --> 03:18:16,729
They... Okay, we're good. What the fuck? That scared the shit out of me. I was looking over

899
03:18:16,729 --> 03:18:31,850
the chat. What the hell is going on? I had to do some canonizing. Hold up. You. You're next.

900
03:18:32,569 --> 03:18:38,569
Wait, what? Sorry about that. When did you find these guys? Like I said, I made some calls.

901
03:18:38,569 --> 03:18:41,129
Yeah, the character is a mod that makes the sliders much higher.

902
03:18:43,020 --> 03:18:45,500
The gentleman of the row. It's been great so far.

903
03:18:56,569 --> 03:18:57,209
Giving a speech?

904
03:19:18,059 --> 03:19:22,219
Pierce, you're on the Ronin. I want to know who's calling the shots and what businesses

905
03:19:22,219 --> 03:19:28,200
they're running. Done. Shandy, you got the sons of Shandy. It's gotta be them. Fuck you, sir.

906
03:19:28,200 --> 03:19:32,120
Do you ever have kids? It's cool. I got this. No, I've shit my pants in the last year. Carlos.

907
03:19:32,120 --> 03:19:37,479
I can't handle it. I wouldn't be able to do it. All right. Once we're done here,

908
03:19:37,479 --> 03:19:41,719
talk to one of these guys. They'll have something for you to do. It's our time now.

909
03:19:41,719 --> 03:19:59,559
Let's get this shit started. That means you must be good at changing diapers. Okay,

910
03:19:59,559 --> 03:20:14,780
you now recruit a single saint follower. Press up to recruit nearby saints. Okay, cool. So I can have

911
03:20:14,780 --> 03:20:25,450
a one-person crew. All right, so there are more symbols popping up here. What do these mean?

912
03:20:26,170 --> 03:20:35,139
Start of Ronin mission? Start the sons of... Hello? Hey, hey, be cool. It's not so bad.

913
03:20:35,139 --> 03:20:39,139
Mero asked to sit down and have a chat with you. He wants to work something out before things get

914
03:20:39,139 --> 03:20:55,459
out of control. I got it. Okay, there's a lot going on here. What's that? A drink?

915
03:21:00,729 --> 03:21:08,389
I wanted more of that. There are diverging quest lines. It's an RPG. Really?

916
03:21:12,920 --> 03:21:19,079
That's actually pretty cool. I want to do this one. No, I want to do one of the

917
03:21:19,079 --> 03:21:25,620
just random missions. This game's really fun. You know what sucks? We talked about...

918
03:21:25,620 --> 03:21:41,899
Because this is THQ, right? Yeah. This is THQ, right? Here comes the THQ rant.

919
03:21:46,010 --> 03:21:51,909
Well, you know what I'm going to say. Who saw that?

920
03:21:57,770 --> 03:22:13,670
All right. Can you get arrested? What's going on? I'm looking over there.

921
03:22:13,670 --> 03:22:46,200
I'm not paying attention to these two. Come on, do it. Oh my God. Fine. Never mind. The drip.

922
03:22:55,579 --> 03:22:59,739
Stop. Everybody stop. I'm warning them. I'm trying to warn them.

923
03:23:08,069 --> 03:23:17,430
How did I drive by it? What's the diamond? Oh, what's the... I want to go to the diamond.

924
03:23:17,430 --> 03:23:36,899
No, I want to throw my head on the thing. I want to throw this person. Can I rob this place?

925
03:23:36,979 --> 03:23:59,620
Jewelry stores allow you to customize your character. Oh, rob your weapon? I got to get the...

926
03:24:06,729 --> 03:24:15,059
Okay. I guess I'll take... Do you have any silver? You guys have any silver? I'm looking for

927
03:24:15,059 --> 03:24:27,139
sterling silver. Why can't I... She's got a knife. Why does this not work? This thing fucking sucks.

928
03:24:30,950 --> 03:24:48,840
Why does this not work? She took a picture of me.

929
03:24:51,700 --> 03:24:55,780
She thought if you have a knife, you're just going to take pictures. What are you doing?

930
03:24:57,430 --> 03:25:24,489
Give me this register. No, I'm slowing down. I need to get back in the car. Give me the money

931
03:25:24,489 --> 03:26:02,809
that's in there. How do I break it? How do I... Do I have to step on it? What the fuck? This thing's

932
03:26:02,809 --> 03:26:24,629
not broken. It's not broken. What the fuck, dude? Is it... Can I... Tell me if I'm wrong or not. Can

933
03:26:24,629 --> 03:26:48,549
I actually do this? You can't. Okay. Well, what the hell am I doing? All right. Get the cops off.

934
03:26:48,549 --> 03:27:29,030
You have to do fine aim at the store clerk to do a robbery. Okay. No, don't play the fucking

935
03:27:29,030 --> 03:27:59,930
harmonica. I want to eat the food. How do I eat the food? Eat it. Quick, quick, quick. No, fuck

936
03:27:59,930 --> 03:28:37,450
around. They're outside. She just went through the window. She went through the passenger window.

937
03:28:37,450 --> 03:29:01,479
What? Who is she shooting at? I'm very confused as to what just happened. Oh, it's this guy. I'm

938
03:29:01,479 --> 03:29:23,000
going to see how this plays out. Here he comes. We're out. Oh, shit. It's here. What is this?

939
03:29:23,000 --> 03:29:44,200
Car shop? Get that off the screen. I don't know. What is this? Go find a swindle. Oh, I found it.

940
03:29:50,180 --> 03:30:06,309
Why are you going so fast? They're gone. No, don't. No, do not. No, don't. Shoot the gun.

941
03:30:07,270 --> 03:30:29,639
Shoot the gun, you imbecile. You're the worst gamer alive. No, I'm not. I lost them. Where are they,

942
03:30:29,639 --> 03:30:52,620
though? They show up randomly, don't they? Five of them were just on the screen. Come on, spawn one.

943
03:30:52,620 --> 03:31:07,540
What am I doing? I'm looking for one of these cars. Sorry, I had to blink really hard. My eyes

944
03:31:07,540 --> 03:31:29,319
are watering. Is there no other one of these cars? I was trying to bait the cop to go over

945
03:31:29,319 --> 03:31:51,850
there and they didn't. Why won't one of these show up? They show up in different districts.

946
03:31:51,850 --> 03:32:14,729
Here we go. This one is a million. What the hell? They desperately get out. Get out, please. I'm

947
03:32:14,729 --> 03:32:36,809
not going to kill anybody. This thing is so slow. This is the slowest car ever. There's a lot of

948
03:32:36,809 --> 03:33:02,250
extra weight in here. I just joined. Why is he an ogre? A thousand bucks. Nice. Oh, I can't wait

949
03:33:02,250 --> 03:33:08,950
later on. I'm going to get takeout and watch Ernest Saves Christmas. An absolute fucking classic

950
03:33:08,950 --> 03:33:36,120
movie. I can't wait. Let's go over here. Should I do one of the main missions? Yeah, if you don't

951
03:33:36,120 --> 03:33:44,069
watch Ernest Saves Christmas in the next couple weeks, don't come back to this stream. I have to

952
03:33:44,069 --> 03:33:50,709
be very, very realistic. If you do not watch Ernest Saves Christmas in the next three or four weeks,

953
03:33:51,350 --> 03:34:11,020
don't come back here. What if you don't celebrate Christmas? All right. Well, let me rephrase that.

954
03:34:11,020 --> 03:34:17,659
Let me rephrase that. I mean, if you celebrate Christmas, okay, then you don't watch Ernest

955
03:34:17,659 --> 03:34:26,090
Saves Christmas. All right. I'm a fucking idiot. I'm an idiot. I'll take that loss. If you celebrate

956
03:34:26,090 --> 03:34:29,850
Christmas, you don't watch Ernest Saves Christmas, then you're in deep shit if you come back here.

957
03:34:30,569 --> 03:34:43,909
In fact, you know what? No, let's go even further. You got to go watch all the Ernest movies in the

958
03:34:43,909 --> 03:34:53,049
next month or don't come back. By the way, you got to get started. There's like 15 of them.

959
03:35:03,930 --> 03:35:16,500
You can do this. You can do it. You can do it. Come on, please. I know you're capable of doing this.

960
03:35:31,909 --> 03:36:05,780
Come on, get the fuck out of here. Get up there. Get up there. You piece of shit. Did that kill me?

961
03:36:06,340 --> 03:36:35,079
Here we go. What's this thing? This is my garage. Oh, it's a garage guy. Can I eat one of these?

962
03:36:41,670 --> 03:36:48,139
All right. This mission is a brotherhood mission. What's the one behind it?

963
03:36:48,700 --> 03:37:01,479
It's two. Is that inside? When are you going to do an Ernest tier list movie? Soon. I mean,

964
03:37:01,479 --> 03:37:05,639
it's not going to be very long content because every single one of them is an S tier.

965
03:37:06,360 --> 03:37:21,530
What in the name of God just happened in here? What the fuck? He was doing like,

966
03:37:22,569 --> 03:37:35,139
this person has to be stopped, right? I have to stop this person. I'm trying to save you.

967
03:37:43,860 --> 03:37:47,299
Gang strongholds are centers of operation for each gang. Find and wipe them all out

968
03:37:47,299 --> 03:38:02,500
to deal hard blows to each gang. Okay. That person was on my team. He was red on the mini

969
03:38:02,500 --> 03:38:12,149
map. I don't think so. Oh, we're doing this shit again. I don't want to do this.

970
03:38:13,190 --> 03:38:41,510
No, I don't want to. I'm not killing anybody. No, I refuse. Except for these two. This is

971
03:38:41,510 --> 03:38:48,860
Dark Souls area. It is. Yeah. This is like blight. This is like the entrance to blight town.

972
03:38:49,819 --> 03:39:03,909
The bridges, the little corridors, the little ledges. Oh, I can't wait to play Elden Ring.

973
03:39:04,549 --> 03:39:21,420
Do I have to even be hostile? Wait, that's not, I don't have to destroy that. All right. I'm not,

974
03:39:21,420 --> 03:39:25,989
look, I'm just, let me go. Holy shit. There's so many people here. Are you kidding me?

975
03:39:26,709 --> 03:39:30,309
There's like, there's like 500 people here. How am I going to do this?

976
03:39:38,250 --> 03:39:53,930
I don't even want to be violent. I don't want, I don't, I want non-violence. I just need to get,

977
03:39:53,930 --> 03:40:01,799
okay, hold on. I'm so fat. I can just run into them. Perfect. Nobody has to get hurt.

978
03:40:09,590 --> 03:40:21,129
What the fuck? It didn't work on this one. Good. All right. We're done. We're done. We're done.

979
03:40:21,129 --> 03:40:35,379
We're done. We're done. I don't have to do anything. We're good. Jim Varney's character,

980
03:40:35,379 --> 03:40:38,899
Ernest P. Warrell, was created by the Nashville advertising agency and we used it. Oh yeah. He

981
03:40:38,899 --> 03:40:45,750
did local commercials. The best one is when he has his hands on the windowsill and he's like,

982
03:40:45,750 --> 03:40:51,350
hey, Vern. He leans in, he's talking about milk. He's like, I have for you the best creamiest yogurt

983
03:40:51,350 --> 03:40:57,510
in all the world. And then Vern grabs it from his hand and the windowsill lands like flies down and

984
03:40:57,510 --> 03:41:11,139
hits him in the hands. And he's like, entire Ernest advertising line is perfect. He's on a

985
03:41:11,139 --> 03:41:19,020
ladder. At one point he gets pushed back and he falls off the roof. Immune to ads. I'm sorry. I

986
03:41:19,020 --> 03:41:30,920
will buy whatever Ernest tells me to. I don't care what it is. I need to be more, have more respect

987
03:41:30,920 --> 03:41:57,799
for this one. Okay. What about, what's this? Did I lose respect? I already know all this.

988
03:41:57,799 --> 03:42:08,180
There's a train in the game. All right. We found a new thing to play with. Not yet. Which one's the

989
03:42:18,379 --> 03:42:36,520
Get out of here. You're fucking dead. Excuse me. What was that for? Yeah. You know what? I can't

990
03:42:36,520 --> 03:42:41,239
understand. Uh, look, you know how movies over the years, like they get like, oh, cult followings or

991
03:42:41,239 --> 03:42:48,950
whatever. It, it, it is, it is insulting to me that most of the Ernest movies have like 20% on

992
03:42:48,950 --> 03:43:03,579
Rotten Tomatoes. I can't, I honestly don't understand. I can't understand. That's unbelievable

993
03:43:03,579 --> 03:43:08,620
to me because they're not good. That's what you just said is unbelievable to me. And what you just

994
03:43:08,620 --> 03:43:17,739
said is very hurtful to me. What you just said is very hurtful to me. Stop. Don't say that.

995
03:43:18,379 --> 03:43:34,489
I want that bike. Not that one. That one's dirty. I want the one that's clean and hasn't been used

996
03:43:34,489 --> 03:43:55,750
or destroyed. Oh, this chop chop. You fucking idiot. No. Hold on. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up.

997
03:43:55,750 --> 03:44:00,709
What's wrong with me? What am I doing? What am I doing on the ground? What's wrong with my character?

998
03:44:02,139 --> 03:44:32,790
Uh, what you were busted a small amount of cash and they, the metal detector doesn't even work.

999
03:44:32,790 --> 03:44:57,510
I like take it. Can I steal something? I'm not in trouble. Not yet. Move out of the way. I don't

1000
03:44:57,510 --> 03:45:31,719
want to hit you a little bit further. You kidding me? Fine. The chairs. I just like home alone to

1001
03:45:31,719 --> 03:45:53,930
this guy. This guy can't even move. He can't get up. I'm not in trouble for that. It's what

1002
03:45:53,930 --> 03:46:29,049
happened. What exploded at that? I didn't get in trouble. All right. I'm going to go do that.

1003
03:46:29,049 --> 03:46:44,180
One of the missions I can do. Oh, this is one of the chop chop. That was unbelievable that

1004
03:46:44,180 --> 03:46:50,180
that happened. Yeah. I even tried to break. That was actually unbelievable. That was unbelievable.

1005
03:47:06,700 --> 03:47:10,620
I thought I could go right through it. It's a fucking, it's a white picket fence.

1006
03:47:11,579 --> 03:47:26,899
It's not like concrete. There's 2000 bucks. Holy shit. I should just do this for a little while.

1007
03:47:27,379 --> 03:48:12,649
Oh shit. What can I, I need more respect. I guess I'm more close too. This one is trail blazing.

1008
03:48:12,649 --> 03:48:31,379
I'm curious what that is. That guy didn't even move. Holy shit. Where do you get the hamburger?

1009
03:48:31,379 --> 03:48:52,790
I want that. All right. Don't do that anymore. I bet you get points for riding a wheelie for

1010
03:48:52,790 --> 03:49:11,430
a long time though, right? If I were to take a guess. All right. What is this? Thanks for stopping

1011
03:49:11,430 --> 03:49:16,469
by. The brothers of Theta appreciate. The brothers of Theta better. If you do not take damage in the

1012
03:49:16,469 --> 03:49:21,430
next 10 minutes, we will take 200 million off the deck. So what's the problem? Okay.

1013
03:49:22,469 --> 03:49:27,290
Beat our step team. Now they think they hot shit. We need someone to knock them down to pay.

1014
03:49:27,290 --> 03:49:31,290
You got anything I can use. So they know you sent the message this year. We bought a flame suit for

1015
03:49:31,290 --> 03:49:37,290
pledge hazing. You think you can find a way to cares about the debt anymore. An old meme. Oh,

1016
03:49:37,290 --> 03:49:46,819
you know what I got? I got almonds right here. Let's go for it. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Those are

1017
03:49:46,819 --> 03:50:06,659
crunchy. Yep. I have to be careful because these have like wasabi and soy sauce on them, which means

1018
03:50:08,520 --> 03:50:13,319
you literally can't pick them up with your fucking hands. Like every other goddamn snack that prides

1019
03:50:13,319 --> 03:50:19,850
itself on having a bunch of shit all over it that gets all over you. Oh dude, you got to eat

1020
03:50:19,850 --> 03:50:25,590
Takis. Dude, they're the best. They're so good. No, fuck those things. You can't eat them. You cannot

1021
03:50:25,590 --> 03:50:32,860
eat Takis unless you use a fork or chopsticks or something. Why is there so much shit all of them?

1022
03:50:32,860 --> 03:50:44,899
Dude, just eat chopsticks. What if I don't have a pair of chopsticks with me? Am I just going to

1023
03:50:44,899 --> 03:50:56,729
carry chopsticks with me everywhere? Takis are one of the... Okay, seriously. If you... I put a tier

1024
03:50:56,729 --> 03:51:04,680
list of snacks in a place where if I eat one of them, I have to wash my hands. Like if you pick

1025
03:51:04,680 --> 03:51:10,040
up one Taki with your fingers, you have to wash your hands. I don't know. Fuck, they give me some

1026
03:51:10,040 --> 03:51:20,170
almonds. Baked Lay's don't do that. Baked Lay's are the best complete S++ tier snack. They're the

1027
03:51:20,170 --> 03:51:32,329
best. I don't have to do that with Baked Lay's. You know, they did a study where they took a bunch

1028
03:51:32,329 --> 03:51:37,219
of people and they did an IQ test to them. And they... I think the study was somewhere in

1029
03:51:37,540 --> 03:51:41,379
California. It had like 500 people in it. And they did an IQ test with everybody.

1030
03:51:41,940 --> 03:51:48,379
And then they asked what their favorite snack was. And most of the people that had over 120 IQ,

1031
03:51:49,020 --> 03:51:56,409
Baked Lay's were a top three in the rankings. It was maybe somewhere in California. It was

1032
03:51:56,409 --> 03:52:04,520
one of the LA institutes. Which is like, it's kind of interesting to think about that.

1033
03:52:04,520 --> 03:52:17,719
It's not real study. What are you talking about? Okay, let's go. Race to the finish for

1034
03:52:18,280 --> 03:52:27,139
cash and respect. I believe you. Yeah, why wouldn't you? Okay, bonus seconds earned from ramming

1035
03:52:27,139 --> 03:52:33,500
people and cars. Well, that's easy. I do that without trying anyways. Three, two, one.

1036
03:52:47,459 --> 03:52:57,559
This is fucked up. No, the study was a completely peer-reviewed independent third-party study.

1037
03:52:58,280 --> 03:53:26,680
I'm not running over enough people. Or cars for that matter. I didn't have to do anything. Oh!

1038
03:53:27,319 --> 03:53:48,069
How did that not hit everybody? There was a study in 2017 that did an IQ test on 5,000 people.

1039
03:53:48,069 --> 03:53:51,430
Then they asked them who their favorite Twitch streamer was. And anyone with under 70 IQ said

1040
03:53:51,430 --> 03:53:58,059
it was you. IQ doesn't fucking even matter. It's like a completely stupid outdated thing to have.

1041
03:53:58,940 --> 03:54:06,459
So whatever you say, who cares? That was fucking cool, but it didn't do anything for me.

1042
03:54:06,459 --> 03:54:13,850
Please just hit the dumb. There's too much smoke on the screen. I can't see anything.

1043
03:54:25,299 --> 03:54:28,819
But isn't it kind of weird though that when I'm walking around town and walking around the city,

1044
03:54:28,819 --> 03:54:35,540
I see these businessmen walking around with suits on. They're on the phone. I see doctors

1045
03:54:35,540 --> 03:54:39,780
walking around with stethoscopes around their necks walking around talking on the phone and stuff.

1046
03:54:39,780 --> 03:54:45,299
And they have like a bag of baked lays in their other hand. That's so surprising apparently.

1047
03:54:46,180 --> 03:55:19,579
Is it? Business man does not equal intelligence. What are you talking about? That guy has a tie-on.

1048
03:55:19,579 --> 03:55:26,899
I trust him. I feel like that's something Peter Griffin would say. I'm sorry.

1049
03:55:30,739 --> 03:55:40,090
All right, I got money. Let's use it. No, he had a tie-on, Loish. I trust him.

1050
03:55:40,729 --> 03:55:52,299
Do you guys remember? I completely forgot about this. Do you remember when I did like the

1051
03:55:52,299 --> 03:55:57,260
do the entire family guy thing with like the weird family guy piano thing in the background?

1052
03:55:58,760 --> 03:56:07,860
That I deleted that from my memory. I don't remember even what was happening.

1053
03:56:08,600 --> 03:56:20,180
What was I was I was reading like a script or something, right? Oh, I was reading

1054
03:56:20,180 --> 03:56:35,899
Germacraft as the different characters. Right. That was so fucking weird. I tried to do it with

1055
03:56:35,899 --> 03:56:50,940
every character. Oh, come on. I was at work laughing during that. Hopefully I didn't get

1056
03:56:50,940 --> 03:57:07,110
any in trouble. That was traumatizing. Now you have to do it as the Attack on Titan character.

1057
03:57:08,440 --> 03:57:10,920
What was like Attack on Titan music playing in the background?

1058
03:57:19,510 --> 03:57:25,319
Uh, I don't know about that. I'm not so sure about that. What does this want me to do?

1059
03:57:31,739 --> 03:57:38,819
Why does it want me to go down here? GPS is so fucked up right now. What?

1060
03:57:40,809 --> 03:57:54,149
It's just go in the ocean and swim there. What? That very clearly was go down the staircase.

1061
03:57:59,239 --> 03:58:06,889
It really was. You saw it wrap around the staircase. I'm not crazy. I followed it because

1062
03:58:06,889 --> 03:58:18,090
I don't know what is there's such a red marker over there. Oh my fucking God. Jeremy, please.

1063
03:58:21,020 --> 03:58:35,590
Look, it's on the staircase. There's not even a road here. What the fuck? They did this on the

1064
03:58:35,590 --> 03:58:52,780
office. I've never seen the office. Why is the character dressed as the guy from Happy Wheels?

1065
03:59:07,299 --> 03:59:14,819
This GPS is fucked. What is it talking about? Why does it want me to do this? I don't understand.

1066
03:59:17,299 --> 03:59:36,010
I'm just going to go this way. This doesn't make any sense. Dude, somebody's fucking with

1067
03:59:36,010 --> 03:59:42,180
me right now. The game is just messing with my head. What is this? Where is this telling me to

1068
03:59:42,180 --> 03:59:53,639
go? I'm going around in a circle. I'm just walking. This is where I wanted to go. It was here,

1069
03:59:53,639 --> 04:00:25,100
right? Where's the hamburger place? Yeah, it's the mall. Okay. I was right. Nobody here. All

1070
04:00:25,100 --> 04:00:37,500
right. So you said I could rob this place. Let me buy something first. I need some new clothes.

1071
04:00:37,500 --> 04:00:46,979
Game crashed. No. When was the last time I saved it? Shit. I think it was not that far away. I

1072
04:00:46,979 --> 04:01:12,260
wasn't in a mission or anything. God damn it. Why? I need the music again. Yeah, that's right here.

1073
04:01:12,260 --> 04:01:21,930
All right. We're good. You said you saved? I did. No, yeah. Six thousand. Yeah, this is fine.

1074
04:01:23,000 --> 04:01:31,559
I'm going to do this mission here. Either Ronin. What should I do? Does it matter? Ronin? Ronin's

1075
04:01:31,559 --> 04:01:42,200
the one with the bikes and the katanas. Let's see. I'm curious. What's up with the dollhouse?

1076
04:01:42,200 --> 04:01:48,920
Dollhouse my ass. This is how we're going to fuck up the Ronin. This'll be good. Trust me.

1077
04:01:48,920 --> 04:01:54,520
It is. The Ronin have a stake in Poseidon's palace. So I figure hitting their biggest money maker is

1078
04:01:54,520 --> 04:01:59,000
a good way to show them we're not fucking around. Okay. So what's the plan? You and I enter the

1079
04:01:59,000 --> 04:02:03,639
casino here. Once inside, we need to distract this security guard. I was thinking you could catch

1080
04:02:03,639 --> 04:02:08,600
me cheating or some shit like that. Anyway, while the guard's concerned with throwing me out, Gato

1081
04:02:08,600 --> 04:02:13,479
sneak in through this security door. Don't worry. I already got today's passcode from the blackjack

1082
04:02:13,479 --> 04:02:18,760
dealer Shandi's fucking. Now once inside, Gato had to sneak past the guards to cut the power.

1083
04:02:18,760 --> 04:02:23,319
And when that happens, we only have about 45 seconds before the backup generator turns on.

1084
04:02:23,879 --> 04:02:30,840
During the blackout though. He's eating Takis. No. But what if we just start here,

1085
04:02:30,840 --> 04:02:34,760
walk into the casino and just shoot all the motherfuckers that are between us and the money.

1086
04:02:34,760 --> 04:02:39,639
Well, I just think of the red dust being absorbed into my intestinal tract. I don't want that to

1087
04:02:39,639 --> 04:02:46,629
happen. You know what I mean? If you eat like a half a bag of Takis or whatever, like heavily

1088
04:02:46,629 --> 04:02:52,069
red food coloring stuff, I don't like want like red, like red dust absorbed into my fucking

1089
04:02:52,069 --> 04:03:01,100
intestines. I don't know. It just probably fine. I don't want to do that. Don't you like think of

1090
04:03:01,100 --> 04:03:04,940
like just like drinking? I don't know. Okay. Let me be, let me, I gotta make this clear.

1091
04:03:04,940 --> 04:03:10,790
I'm not saying that this is weird or gross. I mean it, but it is. Is my health going down?

1092
04:03:11,350 --> 04:03:29,159
How can I become like a Redditor like you? Hmm. Well, hold on. Okay. So listen,

1093
04:03:29,719 --> 04:03:35,299
anything that has a heavy amount of powder or like food coloring or like food dye,

1094
04:03:37,290 --> 04:03:43,290
you do understand. Now this is not, this is not me making it up. This is factual information. This

1095
04:03:43,290 --> 04:03:52,979
is just real shit. Red food dye comes from two distinct sources. One is bugs, like crushed up

1096
04:03:52,979 --> 04:03:57,780
bugs. They derive it from that. And the other one, I believe now correct me if I'm wrong,

1097
04:03:57,780 --> 04:04:12,579
is like petroleum. It's like from like gasoline or something. Isn't it? It's like a chemical they pull

1098
04:04:12,579 --> 04:04:22,649
out of it. So I'm telling you, I prefer the bugs. I would rather eat the bugs. I'd rather eat like

1099
04:04:22,649 --> 04:04:38,540
the red food coloring bugs. I don't want the other one. It's a, it's a petroleum byproduct.

1100
04:04:38,540 --> 04:04:45,819
Right. Okay. So if I have an opportunity to eat the bugs or the petroleum byproduct,

1101
04:04:46,540 --> 04:05:08,200
which one are you going to pick? Correct answer is grow your own food. God. Oh shit. I wasn't

1102
04:05:08,200 --> 04:05:23,719
looking. Bugs are a different byproduct. Oh my God. I've hit every car. Okay. But I don't know. I

1103
04:05:23,719 --> 04:05:30,280
just, I just feel something is so unnatural about, I know people love like flaming hot Cheetos and

1104
04:05:30,280 --> 04:05:36,120
stuff, but man, like I know there's like the blue Takis and shit. Why? Like, oh, I want the bright

1105
04:05:36,120 --> 04:05:45,739
blue fucking ecto cooler Takis. What's going on here? The Nelth flavoring is squeezed from a

1106
04:05:45,739 --> 04:05:54,229
beaver's anus. God, if you get like real for now, like a vanilla fucking plant, whatever it is,

1107
04:05:54,229 --> 04:05:58,780
what is vanilla? It's like a plant. It's a herb, but what is vanilla? It's a, it's a plant.

1108
04:05:59,799 --> 04:06:11,100
Oh shit. I just think I didn't know. It's a bean. Yeah. We just walk. What do we do here?

1109
04:06:11,739 --> 04:06:25,059
Take out. Okay. I'm going to, I'm going to be like the old like person at the casino.

1110
04:06:45,829 --> 04:07:14,420
Can I play? Can I play? What? I can't play. What the fuck did I just, what's going on?

1111
04:07:18,379 --> 04:07:24,840
It's the guy from casino. Get out. Get him out. Get him out. Get him out. Get him out.

1112
04:07:27,370 --> 04:07:32,250
I get shocked so many times. What the fuck are you doing, dude? I don't want to, this, this,

1113
04:07:33,129 --> 04:08:04,340
Oh, I already got pasta. I don't want to shoot. Oh, they're up top.

1114
04:08:08,010 --> 04:08:19,930
Pasta. Italiano garden. Ooh. Well, he uses the, what? Oh my goodness. That hurts.

1115
04:08:38,020 --> 04:08:45,260
Oh, well, Larry, Larry, David. Oh, I love doing the Larry, David. I can do it really well.

1116
04:08:45,979 --> 04:09:03,819
You're taking a long time to do this. Hurry up. No, that was Jeff. Oh, what do you mean?

1117
04:09:04,540 --> 04:09:06,139
They both did the same thing. They both do that.

1118
04:09:11,290 --> 04:09:21,500
When are you going to put Christmas music on? We already did the Christmas music thing.

1119
04:09:22,299 --> 04:09:34,659
You get out of here with your fucking unbrushed teeth. You fucking idiot. All right. Should I

1120
04:09:34,659 --> 04:09:54,600
do a Kirby enthusiasm tier list? Cause, cause Susie's up at like S tier. We good? Um,

1121
04:09:55,319 --> 04:10:00,709
are we dead? Why does everything need a tier list? Because I'm, I don't know. I'm

1122
04:10:01,510 --> 04:10:19,370
trying to make the zoomers think I'm cool. Well, they call the cops. Big surprise there.

1123
04:10:20,090 --> 04:10:33,239
I already think you're cool. Oh, thanks. I don't have to try anymore. One of my favorite curb.

1124
04:10:33,239 --> 04:10:37,420
I'm watching the current season, right? One of my favorite jokes this season. If you haven't seen

1125
04:10:37,420 --> 04:10:43,159
it, but you know, spoilers hold yours close for a second. Uh, when they're talking about cheese

1126
04:10:43,159 --> 04:10:49,000
and they're talking about feta cheese and Leon's like, I don't even think mice like that shit.

1127
04:10:49,719 --> 04:10:53,239
He's like, you gotta be in a specific mood for cheese. And I don't think even mice like that

1128
04:10:53,239 --> 04:11:15,899
shit. The way it's delivery is fucking hilarious. Leon is, is absolutely S tier as well. Every

1129
04:11:15,899 --> 04:11:38,069
single thing that Leon says is just as hysterical. Are they going to leave us alone? Um, the person

1130
04:11:38,149 --> 04:11:48,729
sneaking back onto the car. Stop tearing shit. It's cringe. All right. I won't.

1131
04:11:54,489 --> 04:11:58,489
Don't question me. And we're in America. Speak English.

1132
04:12:05,770 --> 04:12:09,610
A little jumpy today. He's knocking on the door.

1133
04:12:09,610 --> 04:12:34,149
Over there. So rude. Sword. Listen, I know you're having a hard time adjusting to the way I run

1134
04:12:34,149 --> 04:12:43,270
things here. How about you let me deal with my father and you call whatever the fuck I tell you

1135
04:12:43,270 --> 04:13:12,069
to deal with. Um, of course. Excellent. Okay. All right. Ooh, $500 a day. All right. You guys said

1136
04:13:12,069 --> 04:13:14,790
that the Ronin missions are the best ones. Should I just do another one? Oh, I don't have enough

1137
04:13:14,790 --> 04:13:34,280
respect. What's your favorite curb episode? The entirety of season seven, which I mean, I count

1138
04:13:34,280 --> 04:13:38,950
that as one episode because I watched the whole season back to back. So I usually watch that in

1139
04:13:38,950 --> 04:14:03,420
one or two sittings. If I ever go back and rewatch, you can gamble in the casino. Really? Where is it?

1140
04:14:03,420 --> 04:14:14,360
Yes, you can. Is it just the Ronin stronghold? Don't tell him that. Who told him? Where is it?

1141
04:14:14,360 --> 04:14:35,110
It's not on the map. Really? Um, where is it? I want to go to it. Do you like Seinfeld?

1142
04:14:35,909 --> 04:14:40,389
I mean, I like Seinfeld. I think was our it was good. There's a lot of really like classic

1143
04:14:40,389 --> 04:14:44,790
episodes. But I think curb is funnier than Seinfeld. Somebody just wanted to punch me

1144
04:14:44,790 --> 04:14:58,870
in the face probably. But I think it's like a more fun show to me. I don't think it's by a whole lot.

1145
04:15:00,329 --> 04:15:07,510
It's not astronomically better. But I think it's I laughed more times at curb than I did at Seinfeld.

1146
04:15:15,239 --> 04:15:19,129
And you know, I have to be really, really honest with you guys. It's the laugh track.

1147
04:15:21,159 --> 04:15:25,000
I can't I can't take any show seriously with a laugh track. I just I just it ruins it.

1148
04:15:25,639 --> 04:15:48,889
Where's this casino? You guys are actually not going to tell me where it is. I'll find it.

1149
04:15:50,379 --> 04:15:58,920
Sidon's palace that on here. Oh, whatever. I don't care. I'm going to go do this mission down here.

1150
04:15:59,479 --> 04:16:28,579
The laugh track on the stream. No, not that one. Fucking God, I don't even want to be doing this.

1151
04:16:32,260 --> 04:16:35,459
I can't have a laugh track. I need to like cue it up and record it and stuff.

1152
04:16:40,260 --> 04:16:47,670
Um, yeah, and you can't just remove a laugh track either. Like, oh, what if they did a thing where

1153
04:16:47,670 --> 04:16:52,790
they remastered some of these old shows? It's like the weird awkward pauses that a lot of these shows

1154
04:16:52,790 --> 04:16:59,129
do when there's laughing. Kind of like when any celebrity doesn't matter how big or small they are

1155
04:16:59,129 --> 04:17:04,100
shows up on SNL, they walk onto the stage. And there's just the clapping and cheering while they

1156
04:17:04,100 --> 04:17:11,860
just go. Yeah. Okay. Yep. Yeah. And everybody just sits there and stares at nothing for like

1157
04:17:11,860 --> 04:17:35,049
20 to 30 straight seconds. It kind of takes me away. I didn't whose door is this? Find and take

1158
04:17:35,049 --> 04:17:41,620
out the individual listed on the hit list. Okay. Use the dossier to figure out how to find the

1159
04:17:41,620 --> 04:17:48,549
target. Then use your minimap to track and kill them. Listen up. Got some people that need to be

1160
04:17:48,549 --> 04:17:55,430
taken care of. You take them out and there's something in it for you. Okay. And then there's

1161
04:17:55,430 --> 04:18:08,409
a security guard for the trailer park. Okay. Orderly the downtown hospital is a lifetime

1162
04:18:08,409 --> 04:18:19,909
skeeters fan. Um, okay, we're going after the mascot. Buy one of each item from the the freckle

1163
04:18:19,909 --> 04:18:27,510
bitches menu and he'll show up to try and sell you on some franchise opportunity. I need to

1164
04:18:27,510 --> 04:18:48,979
pick up King's book. Okay. So we're gonna go get this guy. This is it. Where's this taking me?

1165
04:18:48,979 --> 04:18:58,649
Where is freckled bitches? Oh, right here. Okay. So order everything on the menu.

1166
04:18:59,370 --> 04:19:54,379
I got it. All right. Order one of each thing on the menu. Wait, it's a drive through order

1167
04:19:54,379 --> 04:20:16,840
one of everything. This is expensive. Okay. I ordered everything. Where is he? Because he shows

1168
04:20:16,840 --> 04:20:43,450
up. Oh, there he is. I thought they just fucking ran him over. Um, what? How do they know it's me?

1169
04:20:43,530 --> 04:21:04,649
How do they know it's I'm doing anything bad? You stupid game. What's this music place? Wait,

1170
04:21:04,649 --> 04:21:14,549
can I buy instruments? Oh my God. Can I buy instruments? Music stores. They sell songs.

1171
04:21:14,549 --> 04:21:35,620
Oh, nevermind. Well, can't listen to any of these. Casino is in the hotels in Marina district,

1172
04:21:35,620 --> 04:22:06,409
middle top island, middle top island. Oh shit. Look at that. Somebody said, sorry guys.

1173
04:22:07,610 --> 04:22:13,209
I'm going to turn this 10 grand into 50 grand and I'm buying one of those cool cars.

1174
04:22:13,770 --> 04:22:39,739
I can't be trusted. Play some Kevin. Oh, you know what I watched? And I could not believe what I

1175
04:22:39,739 --> 04:22:46,739
was watching. I watched home sweet home alone. Like the home alone sort of like sequel-y,

1176
04:22:46,739 --> 04:22:56,860
reboot-y, sequel-y thing. Um, the movie was awful. That whole movie, the whole point of

1177
04:22:56,860 --> 04:23:00,059
home alone was, look it, we're going to set up a bunch of like crazy things that happen in a house

1178
04:23:00,059 --> 04:23:05,979
and it's like traps and stuff. The first hour of that movie was just kind of like a,

1179
04:23:05,979 --> 04:23:09,020
a Will Ferrell movie where they didn't have Will Ferrell as the main character

1180
04:23:09,899 --> 04:23:22,500
and nothing happens for like an hour and 15 minutes. That's the first movie too.

1181
04:23:24,149 --> 04:23:32,520
Whoa, whoa. Hold on a minute here. The first home alone was a godly tier higher than that.

1182
04:23:32,520 --> 04:23:41,670
And where is this thing taking me? Oh, oh fuck. That person is going to be so pissed.

1183
04:23:42,549 --> 04:23:45,750
There was somebody in the chat like 10, 20 minutes ago that said,

1184
04:23:45,750 --> 04:23:49,190
stop doing tear shit. It's cringe. And I'm like, all right. And then I just did it again.

1185
04:23:50,069 --> 04:24:14,469
Oh, it's the way point. Okay. So where's the casino? Is the mall? The left? Having opinions

1186
04:24:14,469 --> 04:24:22,620
is not a tier list. I know, but we've recently did the tier list. So it's like in my mind.

1187
04:24:23,420 --> 04:24:53,100
Is this illegal? I guess not. Not really. Blackjack. Can I play slots? Oh, you can,

1188
04:24:53,100 --> 04:25:01,159
you can only play blackjack or poker. All right. Blackjack. Let's go. Oh yeah. Let's go.

1189
04:25:02,040 --> 04:25:30,659
What's the max bet? Oh no. What's the max bet? There is no max bet. No, I didn't mean to do that.

1190
04:25:30,659 --> 04:25:35,620
I didn't. Holy. I meant to hit back, but the stupid, the stupid switch thing where the,

1191
04:25:35,620 --> 04:25:40,500
I was back is a, you know what I'm saying? I wanted to hit B. I wanted to hit B. I'm going

1192
04:25:40,500 --> 04:25:47,979
to win this hand, I think, but I wanted to go back because I wanted to save. Stan, please. Oh,

1193
04:25:48,059 --> 04:26:01,850
thank fucking God. Okay. I wanted to save it before I did this. 17 versus eight. Stay.

1194
04:26:03,290 --> 04:26:19,750
That's too bad. It's this one, right? Is it this one? Which one is it? I don't remember.

1195
04:26:19,750 --> 04:26:42,889
What are you talking about? I just saved it inside of there. It doesn't save your location.

1196
04:26:42,889 --> 04:26:51,940
Oh, okay. I'm sorry. I'm freaked out. All right. I gotta get my respect up. How do I get, I gotta

1197
04:26:51,940 --> 04:27:10,440
like go find like a rival gang. Are you in a rival gang? I'll be honest. When we were walking

1198
04:27:10,440 --> 04:27:13,159
behind this guy, I thought he had like a, I thought he had like a rooster mask on.

1199
04:27:13,719 --> 04:27:39,959
It doesn't give me respect. Now he wants to fight. Okay. How much is in this can? How much is in the

1200
04:27:39,959 --> 04:27:58,500
can? He was faking it. He was faking it. I don't have any bullets. Do I get respect for that?

1201
04:27:59,139 --> 04:28:25,700
I don't need very much respect. Wait. Okay. Here we go. That wasn't enough. I'm going to go do

1202
04:28:25,700 --> 04:28:41,940
whatever this is. That's police activity. That's not respect. No, but the bar on the top right,

1203
04:28:41,940 --> 04:29:05,420
the purple one. You can surf a car. Can you really do a handstand? That's so stupid. Oh,

1204
04:29:05,420 --> 04:29:12,280
no. Oh, God. That person's going to fly off the cliff. Oh, no, no, no, no. Stop, stop, stop.

1205
04:29:12,280 --> 04:29:22,040
Stop, stop. Holy shit. I'm going to just get, I'm going to do that again. Oh my God, dude.

1206
04:29:22,040 --> 04:29:53,030
Go get your car cleaned. What if he gets in an accident? Holy shit. Come on. Stay in it. Oh my

1207
04:29:53,030 --> 04:29:59,459
God. How much respect. This would be the most watched fucking TikTok video ever. How do I not

1208
04:29:59,459 --> 04:30:17,270
have the respect of the whole world right now? Who's screaming? Is the guy in the car? Drive.

1209
04:30:17,270 --> 04:30:43,399
Come on. We need the views. I've been doing this for so long. Oh fuck. That was close. Dude,

1210
04:30:43,399 --> 04:30:55,209
give me the respect for the love of God. Why is it taking so long? Okay. I did it. I did it. I did

1211
04:30:55,209 --> 04:31:26,020
it. Oh my God. He's gone crazy. How much respect did I even get for that? I do it again. Oh shit.

1212
04:31:26,020 --> 04:31:47,459
Okay. Ambulance mission. Let's go. I hit right bumper to do handbrake. I'm sorry.

1213
04:31:48,180 --> 04:32:09,940
It's my fault. That's my fault. I'll take that. What do I do? Move up and down to provide CPR.

1214
04:32:09,940 --> 04:32:30,940
Um, hello? Oh my God. No. How do I do it? Why won't this work? I can't fucking see now. Thanks.

1215
04:32:30,940 --> 04:32:57,129
Do you see that I'm trying to help somebody? Got him. Okay. That guy has the same truck.

1216
04:32:57,770 --> 04:33:12,330
Go run him over immediately. No, I'm trying to get respect. All right. What's going on here?

1217
04:33:12,330 --> 04:34:06,389
What do I do with these? Oh, I have the shock pads. Are you serious? Oh my God. Okay. Let's go.

1218
04:34:06,389 --> 04:34:30,310
Let's go. Hurry up. I'm on level three right now. Get out of the way. All right. You need to be.

1219
04:34:30,310 --> 04:35:10,759
All right. Here we go. Got it. I'm getting money for this. Holy shit. This is actually kind of good.

1220
04:35:10,759 --> 04:35:17,080
SpongeBob scream. What I keep hearing is I keep hearing every flash game scream. It's that one

1221
04:35:17,080 --> 04:35:48,020
that goes like hurry up. Come on. Police. What? Why is everybody freaking out? They don't think

1222
04:35:48,020 --> 04:36:11,560
I'm supposed to be here or something. First thing's going to run over level five. Let's go. Good call.

1223
04:36:11,560 --> 04:37:00,259
What's the max level of really itchy? I six. I'll get there. I work quick. Go to the casino. I'm

1224
04:37:00,259 --> 04:37:21,590
working on it. I need money to go to the casino. Don't you understand? And I'm going to get trapped

1225
04:37:21,590 --> 04:38:13,740
there. I can't go there. Oh shit. Easy. Come on. Do it. This person's. Wait, what? I can't bring

1226
04:38:13,740 --> 04:38:36,580
the person back to life. Level seven. Go to the casino. Don't worry. I will. Where is this up top?

1227
04:38:36,580 --> 04:38:51,590
First on the train tracks. EMT has 10. Okay. Well, I'm almost there. What's this like movie star one?

1228
04:38:51,590 --> 04:39:13,990
Dude, what is in the way? I thought the person was going to punch me. That's not what I wanted.

1229
04:39:13,990 --> 04:39:35,990
One more. Good. A thousand bucks. This is better than doing any missions. This is not the ambulance.

1230
04:39:35,990 --> 04:39:46,389
I thought this was the ambulance. I'm an idiot. I'm sorry. You're not getting any respect. I'm

1231
04:39:46,389 --> 04:39:52,060
getting a lot of money. Look, it's white and red. It was an easy mistake and has a huge back.

1232
04:39:52,060 --> 04:40:47,299
Are you high? No, bro. Are you? Do not run those people over. I can't light on fire, right? Come

1233
04:40:47,299 --> 04:41:10,360
on. There's only one more. I got five minutes to do this shit. I'll go this way. How come the number

1234
04:41:10,360 --> 04:41:18,819
of victims is increasing, but you don't have to save them? That's a good question. Nothing's wrong

1235
04:41:18,819 --> 04:41:26,299
with the car. It's dragging on the ground. Something's wrong with the back left tire.

1236
04:41:33,590 --> 04:42:20,389
Are you serious? Okay. Oh no. I'm going a really dumb way. Why would you shoot at an ambulance

1237
04:42:20,389 --> 04:42:28,150
here? Come on. Stop it. I'm being followed. Oh fuck. I'm being followed. No, not anymore.

1238
04:42:28,869 --> 04:42:40,580
Oh, hold on. Let me take care of you. Where are you? Where'd she go? Oh, okay. She's in the back.

1239
04:42:42,900 --> 04:42:52,090
Okay. Well, I'll just bring her to the hospital. That's fine. This thing is smoking though. I have

1240
04:42:52,090 --> 04:43:13,880
to be careful. There's only one more level after this. I can't screw this up. She's not even on

1241
04:43:13,880 --> 04:43:23,500
like a gurney or anything. Oh no. Oh no. Excuse me. They know she's in here. Oh, come on. Oh no.

1242
04:43:24,220 --> 04:44:25,860
This is bad. I don't have time for this shit. Fucking die. What? I did it to the car? I feel

1243
04:44:25,860 --> 04:44:31,369
like I'm making a specific YouTube video and like a first person shooter. Like only using the one

1244
04:44:31,369 --> 04:44:40,360
item that's like really hard to use. It's like a side item. And why would you ever use it? Oh my

1245
04:44:40,360 --> 04:44:58,540
God. I saw headlights. You. I've had enough of this shit. Move. Oh man. This thing is beat the

1246
04:44:58,540 --> 04:45:05,159
fuck up bad. This is bad. This is going to be horrible. Is she still in the car? Is that the

1247
04:45:05,159 --> 04:45:12,619
problem? This is not good. I have to take care of this now. I have to take care of this right now.

1248
04:45:13,180 --> 04:45:26,380
Come on. There's police here now. Were you helping me? I can't tell. I don't know.

1249
04:45:30,139 --> 04:45:36,060
Get away from me. They just don't stop. This is far cry. What's happening? No, my ambulance.

1250
04:45:36,619 --> 04:46:04,979
I need that. Game crashed. Fuck. No. Oh, all that money gone. Is there a quick save button?

1251
04:46:04,979 --> 04:46:13,060
I can't just like save it in the middle of every single thing. Every 15 seconds.

1252
04:46:13,060 --> 04:46:24,040
Oh, that's sad. Getting into the car animation crashed it. It may have auto saved. Ooh. Damn it.

1253
04:46:24,040 --> 04:46:27,880
Please tell me there was an auto save after I completed that. Come on. Please.

1254
04:46:30,279 --> 04:46:46,380
I don't think so. That's very sad. It's very sad. All right. Well, we're going to have to do the

1255
04:46:46,380 --> 04:46:52,090
thing where every five minutes you guys freak out and spam spam. This sucks. I had like 15 grand.

1256
04:46:52,650 --> 04:47:01,720
Damn it. I blame the like far cry six bullshit where it's just the enemies just spawn a never

1257
04:47:01,720 --> 04:47:08,220
ending on top of you. I need respect and I need to get I'm going to get it somehow. What is this?

1258
04:47:09,799 --> 04:47:31,740
Septic Avenger. I'm kind of I'm curious. I'm curious. This game is a lot of fun though. All

1259
04:47:31,740 --> 04:47:35,990
right. I'm going to take a quick poll in the chat. Do you want to see this again?

1260
04:47:36,889 --> 04:47:45,610
But I continue the playthrough of Saints Row 2. Is having a good time? I'm having a good time.

1261
04:47:45,610 --> 04:47:58,790
I think I'll do it again. So I got the community kind of gentleman of the row mod. Let's do a lot

1262
04:47:58,790 --> 04:48:03,159
of bug fixes and help with a lot of stuff. Is there anything else I should get to help make

1263
04:48:03,159 --> 04:48:09,560
this more stable? Listen, we have to make this quick. What do you think? Stefan is having another

1264
04:48:09,560 --> 04:48:15,479
one of this war race today. And I'm not his pool boy this year. Here's a few things. Okay.

1265
04:48:15,479 --> 04:48:19,400
I've been trying to sell real estate in this area for a month, but no one's buying because

1266
04:48:19,400 --> 04:48:25,720
the property value is too high. What do you want me to do about it? My cousin runs a septic company.

1267
04:48:25,720 --> 04:48:29,080
I figured you could borrow one of his trucks. There's nothing more than GOTR right now.

1268
04:48:30,099 --> 04:48:34,069
You know, you really think people are going to want to buy elections making an official patch

1269
04:48:34,069 --> 04:48:37,430
to fix it. It's really hard to find cheap housing and still what was what did you say?

1270
04:48:38,150 --> 04:48:48,900
Spray sewage all over your targets. What the fuck? Builder has exclusive rights to new homes

1271
04:48:48,900 --> 04:48:53,939
in Cuenbeca and new Henkei. Use space to stop the truck construction sites of business.

1272
04:48:53,939 --> 04:49:04,919
Oh my god, this is ridiculous. Those construction workers have a sense of humor.

1273
04:49:06,279 --> 04:49:12,869
Does it have to do damage? Safety rating on this thing. Why are the cops here?

1274
04:49:13,830 --> 04:49:40,900
This thing. Did I use all the. Oh, I have to wait. We haven't fun yet. Okay. You feel something.

1275
04:49:41,060 --> 04:49:47,349
Spraying somebody's house is a shit. I think my house looks shitty anyway.

1276
04:49:51,369 --> 04:50:04,540
This is disgusting. I wonder if they dented the truck picture of the grill for insurance.

1277
04:50:06,310 --> 04:50:16,889
This is shocking. Does it just stop after we get through? Okay. How much they're willing to

1278
04:50:16,889 --> 04:50:27,639
pay for that property now? Okay. Now we get a spray over here. Lesson to be learned here.

1279
04:50:27,639 --> 04:50:36,500
Don't stand in the way of a septic truck. You love this guy. That person went nuts.

1280
04:50:37,060 --> 04:50:53,830
Asshole. Power washing. I wish I could see the homeowner's face.

1281
04:50:58,419 --> 04:51:14,330
Code it. Hey, not that much more. There's no timer either. Wait, did I fail? What? Oh, come on.

1282
04:51:14,970 --> 04:51:25,419
There is a timer. Oh, what the fuck? Why didn't I. There has exclusive rights to new homes in

1283
04:51:25,419 --> 04:51:34,090
Cuenbeca and new Henkei. Let's pay their construction sites of business. Oh, that ought to make Javier

1284
04:51:34,090 --> 04:51:56,409
happy. I just didn't understand what was going on. How much they're willing to pay for that property

1285
04:51:56,409 --> 04:52:03,000
now? There's a route meter. You have to do it all before the route ends. Ah, okay. So that's the

1286
04:52:03,000 --> 04:52:12,310
time. I thought that was me increasing the amount of damage. I think I'm way ahead. It couldn't

1287
04:52:12,310 --> 04:52:39,080
break. It would have been unsafe. I just made that house. I wish I could see the homeowner's face.

1288
04:52:39,080 --> 04:52:46,310
The cars are almost worth doing more than the buildings. It would have taken too much time.

1289
04:52:46,310 --> 04:52:55,299
Reload it. What the fuck? Construction workers have a sense of humor. This hit and run thing

1290
04:52:55,299 --> 04:53:02,540
really does get easier the more you do it. All right, I'll get there. You okay, buddy?

1291
04:53:02,540 --> 04:53:11,740
You still pull this off, right? Is that reaching? It's not. Oh, I can't reach across the street with

1292
04:53:11,740 --> 04:53:17,020
this shit. Come on. Some people are just inconsiderate drivers, you know? All right, I got it. There we go.

1293
04:53:18,439 --> 04:53:21,479
All right, so what were you saying? They said they were making a patch for this game

1294
04:53:22,040 --> 04:53:27,560
like 10 years later. That's crazy. There we go. Now I can do the mission.

1295
04:53:30,840 --> 04:53:42,099
The developer making the patch recently died of cancer. Oh my God. That's terrible.

1296
04:53:47,700 --> 04:53:55,189
That's awful. Well, this is really cool. This was like really, really fun. That's very saddening.

1297
04:54:00,950 --> 04:54:03,029
Were they working on the patch too, like officially?

1298
04:54:14,459 --> 04:54:17,740
Well, this is really, really cool. And the fact that somebody was like, put this together.

1299
04:54:21,819 --> 04:54:34,360
That's really sad, though. He was the sole reason why they started patching the game.

1300
04:54:34,360 --> 04:54:55,099
Wow. It's still being worked on. Yeah, that is really sad because this is really cool.

1301
04:54:55,099 --> 04:54:58,840
And it's just like, it makes me hear about kind of stuff like that. It just,

1302
04:55:00,630 --> 04:55:04,709
I'm sitting here thinking like, oh, wow, what an awesome mod. Oh, this is so cool. Oh, that guy.

1303
04:55:07,459 --> 04:55:09,779
Why the fuck do we still have to have that shit in the world still?

1304
04:55:12,709 --> 04:55:20,439
Slow us down. This is just sober. It just angers me that like this cancer still is a fucking thing.

1305
04:55:21,400 --> 04:55:26,220
I really hope that whenever hundreds of years from now, maybe even less than that,

1306
04:55:27,020 --> 04:55:40,970
this shit is just gone. And it's just very easy to get rid of. You hope that it's sooner than that.

1307
04:55:40,970 --> 04:55:52,549
Much sooner. There's so much new shit that these medical companies are working on now.

1308
04:55:53,509 --> 04:55:56,630
Yeah, you got to hope that some of this stuff actually plays out.

1309
04:56:02,700 --> 04:56:23,430
I didn't do it. They did. They have the game. I will. I did. I wanted the extra respect.

1310
04:56:24,500 --> 04:56:31,459
All right, let's do it. I can finally do that Ronin mission, right?

1311
04:56:33,939 --> 04:56:51,669
I thought that was a spider. It's not. In fact, I don't know what the hell this thing is.

1312
04:56:52,389 --> 04:57:03,849
Pick up the stop sign. It said I could. Pick it up. I want to pick it up. Cool.

1313
04:57:04,490 --> 04:57:29,419
I just want to test the range. All right. Well, I've launched them. All right. Where do I?

1314
04:57:29,419 --> 04:57:48,169
Where am I going? That way? I need a car. Save. I got it. I saved it. This is very suspicious.

1315
04:57:48,169 --> 04:58:11,020
Why is there an indicator over here? On this roof? When you wash in the shower,

1316
04:58:11,020 --> 04:58:15,419
do you let the water run down your legs soapy or do you actually wash with your hands?

1317
04:58:16,659 --> 04:58:27,830
I rub my hands all over my legs. Most of the soap is so when I lather up, you get like a little bit

1318
04:58:27,830 --> 04:58:33,209
of the squeeze, get it in your hands. Most of it goes on the crotch, right? You just like get it

1319
04:58:33,209 --> 04:58:37,450
all over the crotch, all over like your balls and shit. And then like it really lathers up down there

1320
04:58:37,450 --> 04:58:50,250
and then it goes everywhere else from there. That's the central point outward. If you're

1321
04:58:50,250 --> 04:58:55,369
lathering and you're starting at chest or legs or baton, no, no, no, no. That's the central

1322
04:58:55,369 --> 04:59:02,009
location that can go up. There's an equal distance from like your crotch to everywhere else.

1323
04:59:02,169 --> 04:59:35,740
Arrest that guy. Arrest him. Jesus. All right. Arrest him. Do they cuff people that aren't

1324
04:59:35,740 --> 04:59:39,959
a playable character? Why is there another crew? Is there another? Oh, there's another.

1325
04:59:39,959 --> 05:00:12,520
I thought he shot at the other cop. Whoa. I can't get on the roof. All right. Get me out of here.

1326
05:00:12,520 --> 05:00:29,419
I'm stuck in this area. Get me out of here. What the fuck? Your crosshair was right on him. Yeah,

1327
05:00:29,419 --> 05:00:37,900
I know. It's a joke. What in God's name are you playing as? This is just the character in the

1328
05:00:37,900 --> 05:00:40,860
game. You don't remember. You had like nostalgic glasses on. You don't remember. This is what the

1329
05:00:40,860 --> 05:00:51,020
character looks like. This is what the main character looks like. All right. This is like

1330
05:00:51,020 --> 05:01:11,830
just like a battle going on out here. You suck. You are terrible. I need a car. Okay. I actually

1331
05:01:11,830 --> 05:01:24,500
need a car. Please give me a car. This is getting ridiculous. All right. Now you pissed me off.

1332
05:01:57,939 --> 05:02:07,450
Press R1 to drift. What was that noise? How's my chair? I turned my chair a little bit and it has

1333
05:02:07,450 --> 05:02:41,799
like a squeaky wheel. Don't you see that you don't take a turn if somebody's driving straight.

1334
05:02:41,799 --> 05:02:55,290
Nothing was squeaky about that. Don't change the subject. I'll listen to it. All right. Now

1335
05:02:55,290 --> 05:03:11,720
you pissed me off. I leaned back in the chair and it's the lumbar support goes back and it's

1336
05:03:11,720 --> 05:03:18,330
really, really it needs like WD-40. You guys are just over fucking reacting as usual, right?

1337
05:03:18,330 --> 05:03:58,950
It's okay though. Twitch chat, right? He's a liar. Maybe. Let's go. Technically,

1338
05:03:58,950 --> 05:04:03,110
legal called me up and said that a Ronan bachelor party was getting too touchy feely.

1339
05:04:03,110 --> 05:04:07,669
The bounces have all been paid not to do dick. So if anyone is going to teach those assholes a

1340
05:04:07,669 --> 05:04:16,569
lesson, it's going to have to be you. Okay. Oh, I'm here. All right. I don't have any weapons.

1341
05:04:17,930 --> 05:04:37,959
I have pepper spray and some pistol ammo. I don't know. Can I even do this? I don't think I even

1342
05:04:38,599 --> 05:05:04,090
give you the ATM. Can I pick up the ATM? I only have. Oh, I have plenty of shots. All right. Who's

1343
05:05:04,090 --> 05:05:30,790
bad in here? I assure you I'm holding left. Oh, fuck. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out.

1344
05:05:31,349 --> 05:05:34,470
Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out.

1345
05:05:35,029 --> 05:05:41,900
Watch out. What am I fucking firing at, dude? Why is it hitting the wall? You piece of shit.

1346
05:05:41,900 --> 05:06:26,860
I can't believe you shot that person. Wait a second. What are you doing? You don't. Oh, well.

1347
05:06:29,080 --> 05:06:35,419
I guess that did not register that was happening when I first got in here.

1348
05:06:44,040 --> 05:06:57,060
He paid. I paid for a lap dance. So I'm going to get a lap dance. Hey, didn't expect to see me

1349
05:06:57,060 --> 05:07:37,189
here, did you? Freeze. That's a TV. Freeze. Oh, no. All right. Freeze, scumbag. Oh, no. No,

1350
05:07:37,189 --> 05:07:42,630
don't. Don't make me do this. Don't make me do this. That guy. That guy was a super powered

1351
05:07:42,630 --> 05:08:03,000
person. Hands in the air, scumbag. Get over here. Get over here. Why can't I not grab you?

1352
05:08:03,479 --> 05:08:37,430
You all right? Oh, this is not good. I'm so sorry, but I have to do this.

1353
05:08:41,880 --> 05:08:48,490
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I don't really. I don't want. I can't even pick this

1354
05:08:48,490 --> 05:09:01,400
person up. Oh, my God. No. God damn it. I was trying to throw you out here. You've ruined

1355
05:09:01,400 --> 05:09:22,709
everything. The game got stuck. You didn't think I was going to be fucking this small, did you?

1356
05:09:22,709 --> 05:09:46,169
You didn't think I was this small for that. Dude, really? Honest to God. Hold on. This is very

1357
05:09:46,169 --> 05:10:02,810
important. I'm trying to shoot him in the finger, just like in the finger. I just need. No, it

1358
05:10:02,810 --> 05:10:23,450
doesn't. They can't even be interacted with. Oh, no. I'm supposed to go to the roof. Stay where you

1359
05:10:23,450 --> 05:10:54,919
are. All NPCs don't move. Room back to A. Wait, did I go in here yet? Stairs. I got to get to the

1360
05:10:54,919 --> 05:11:11,560
roof. All right. Take him up from up here. Oh, a CD. How am I supposed to do this? CDs. Just shoot

1361
05:11:11,560 --> 05:11:28,459
them from. I don't know. I have a pistol. Is there a weapon up here I can get? Oh, my fucking God.

1362
05:11:28,459 --> 05:11:58,540
That hurts. Ouch. First try to talk to me. That was weird. Oh, you have a hostage. I'm really glad

1363
05:11:58,540 --> 05:12:08,700
I actually didn't shoot you. I can't hit them. They cannot be injured. Look at this. Oh, no.

1364
05:12:19,849 --> 05:12:32,979
Oh, cops are here. Does this count if I don't kill them? I can fall off this. I got to be careful.

1365
05:12:37,319 --> 05:12:42,599
Where is this person? Over there. Okay, I see. Oh, no. I'm on roller skates.

1366
05:12:43,560 --> 05:13:19,099
This is not the place to be on roller skates. I'm okay. Easy. Don't fall off. Oh, my goodness.

1367
05:13:19,099 --> 05:13:24,580
This person is so good. All jokes are writing themselves. I have not fallen off yet.

1368
05:13:28,340 --> 05:13:49,259
I can't even see this person. Is the tree shooting at me? I don't. Where are they?

1369
05:13:49,259 --> 05:14:16,220
That's it, right? Okay, I got it. Oh, don't do that. A thousand bucks. 500 bucks a day.

1370
05:14:24,810 --> 05:14:35,080
That's saved, right? That counts. Does that count? I got the screen, right? Okay. Good. Thank God.

1371
05:14:35,080 --> 05:14:51,299
Game did not crash. I'm fine. I need a little bit more respect. Let's do another race.

1372
05:14:51,299 --> 05:15:17,900
Let's try to get the gold medal here. It's hard to even see. I can try to screw with them.

1373
05:15:19,180 --> 05:15:32,330
I like to smash it on the brakes. I was trying to get somebody to fly out the windshield.

1374
05:15:32,970 --> 05:15:52,099
What a dummy. You're out. The person's attached to their car. I hit the rock. I'm the one person

1375
05:15:52,099 --> 05:16:36,490
that hits the rock. Get out of here. Excuse me. I had to kill the person back there. I should have

1376
05:16:36,490 --> 05:16:53,319
just killed that person and got on the road. All right. That's a gold medal. Nice. How much is that?

1377
05:16:55,860 --> 05:17:07,220
A thousand dollars. This person's right here. Who is this? Are they in this building in front of me?

1378
05:17:07,860 --> 05:17:22,860
Oh, they're in the hospital. Right. Is that person right there? Is this guy right here?

1379
05:17:22,860 --> 05:18:10,740
I got to get him alone, right? Shock paddles. I don't have shock paddles anymore. If I get the

1380
05:18:10,740 --> 05:18:42,520
plant. Take him out. Take him out. Did I get him? All right. I've had enough. He's spraying your own.

1381
05:18:42,520 --> 05:19:10,819
You fucking moron. Take a gun out. You fucking idiot. Like really? No. Don't you... Everybody

1382
05:19:10,819 --> 05:19:19,939
stay calm. That was a really bad guy. I'm an undercover agent. I'm an undercover police agent,

1383
05:19:19,939 --> 05:19:24,569
FBI officer. This guy was very bad. He was... I don't even know what he was doing. He was doing

1384
05:19:24,569 --> 05:19:48,729
something. Nobody paid me a lot of money to do that. Have a nice day. David again? What? All

1385
05:19:48,729 --> 05:19:56,150
right. Now... What should I do? What's this? Oh, this is for sale. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1386
05:19:56,150 --> 05:20:06,729
I want to spend some money. I want to get some new cool clothes. We're going to get some really like

1387
05:20:06,729 --> 05:20:14,900
snappy nice suits and stuff and maybe some weapons. Yeah. Brass knuckle. What's a good weapon shop?

1388
05:20:14,900 --> 05:20:31,669
Go to the casino. No, I'm not doing that. Go to the mall. The good clothes shop is near the bridge.

1389
05:20:32,500 --> 05:21:01,020
Something down here. I'll try it. Casino will sell you a suit. I don't think they have your size.

1390
05:21:09,610 --> 05:21:16,819
Hostage diversion? You drive at high speeds to evade the cops until your hostage breaks down

1391
05:21:16,819 --> 05:21:30,020
and pays you. What? There's so much shit to do in this game. I have two hostages? Drive really fast

1392
05:21:30,020 --> 05:22:03,099
for a minute. Where's this? I don't understand where... I want to go to the clothing store.

1393
05:22:03,099 --> 05:22:18,009
I don't care about that mission right now. Oh, it's because it's in the back. I think they got

1394
05:22:18,009 --> 05:22:47,189
away. Okay. I want to buy some nice clothes. No, I don't. I want eyes. Human eyes. Okay. Well,

1395
05:22:47,189 --> 05:23:19,479
I mean, I have to do that. That's so stupid. How about a knitted cap? This is not like suits.

1396
05:23:19,479 --> 05:23:36,500
These are different couch fabrics. Where'd you guys bring me to? Go to the suits category? Oh,

1397
05:23:36,500 --> 05:24:01,849
outfits. The game fucking crashed. Of course it did. He fell for it? Oh well. I don't know

1398
05:24:01,849 --> 05:24:19,430
what I just did. Hopefully it's the right one. 34. It's this one. Outfits always crash the game.

1399
05:24:19,430 --> 05:24:24,360
Suit category outright crashes your game every time when previewed. Oh well, that's good to know.

1400
05:24:24,360 --> 05:24:39,049
I can do the mission. For a second I didn't even know what that was on the couch. I didn't even

1401
05:24:39,049 --> 05:24:42,569
know it was me. I was trying to figure out what it was the first two seconds.

1402
05:25:07,340 --> 05:25:33,580
You're one of those deflated people from the anti-smoking ads? Musinex booger person.

1403
05:25:35,689 --> 05:25:39,509
Doesn't he have an English accent too? Isn't he like, oh Roy, I'm going to get under your

1404
05:25:40,229 --> 05:25:47,349
fucking toenails. Oh no, Musinex is there. I'm going to fuck up your lungs. Doesn't he have

1405
05:25:47,349 --> 05:26:43,619
a British accent? Buy an expensive car. Holy shit. Whatever. Whoa, that's cool.

1406
05:26:43,619 --> 05:27:05,799
Cool. How much is it? Except I only have $13,900 as a net worth total. So hopefully it's under that.

1407
05:27:06,520 --> 05:27:46,299
Did I buy it? I'm going a different route. See? They're coming down that road right now. Look

1408
05:27:46,299 --> 05:28:07,319
at that. 500 IQ play. Good stuff. Don't bait me with that bullshit. I'm not going that way.

1409
05:28:08,040 --> 05:28:35,959
Told you it was going to work. Eventually. Hello, I brought you a car.

1410
05:28:42,330 --> 05:29:08,569
The wheel's still spinning. Oh no. You idiot. You absolute idiot. And I'm talking about both

1411
05:29:08,569 --> 05:29:14,729
people on the screen right now. Because what that did, unfortunately, is it wedged it into the car.

1412
05:29:15,369 --> 05:29:23,479
I would have been able to go, but the bike is now here and that is a huge problem. This is very bad.

1413
05:29:29,720 --> 05:29:37,029
Hello? Settle down. All right. I got to knock that. Wait. Another one crashed. What are they doing?

1414
05:29:40,259 --> 05:29:52,729
Okay. You guys got to settle the fuck down. All right. I got back in the car. Good. Let's go.

1415
05:29:53,529 --> 05:30:08,939
Come on, dude. Why? Why did you have to do this? Get the fuck away from me, dude.

1416
05:30:20,229 --> 05:30:30,500
This is stuck now. I think I just made it worse somehow. How did I make this worse?

1417
05:30:31,299 --> 05:30:38,540
I'm like a different character that just came around. What?

1418
05:30:40,139 --> 05:31:00,229
Leave me alone. The game's going to crash. I know it. They're going to keep piling in here.

1419
05:31:06,229 --> 05:31:16,659
I can't even get up. Eventually, they'll do that enough times where I'll be able to get out of here,

1420
05:31:16,659 --> 05:31:33,299
I think. Can I use all their bodies and all their crushed rubble to drive over it? Oh no. I wonder

1421
05:31:33,299 --> 05:31:39,400
what's going to happen. I hear a motorcycle. I wonder if the motorcycle is coming this way.

1422
05:31:39,400 --> 05:32:06,700
Oh, that was a cop. Oh dear. How could it possibly still not be able to move?

1423
05:32:06,700 --> 05:32:29,220
This is not possible. Actually, it's impossible. Give me a car. Give me another car. Will you just

1424
05:32:29,220 --> 05:32:35,369
leave already? Get up. Can I please just get up and leave? There's no reason for you to be here.

1425
05:32:35,369 --> 05:32:43,500
Just get out of here. Go this way. Just go that way. I didn't even do anything illegal. Oh my god.

1426
05:32:43,500 --> 05:33:11,159
I did. Did I? Yes. What the fuck? There's so many motorcycles under here. It's going to be

1427
05:33:11,159 --> 05:33:33,180
impossible to get this to move. Idiots. This is not accomplishing anything. I'm just going to

1428
05:33:33,180 --> 05:33:50,630
be in... It's going to get this stuck. I need to take the L? Yeah, I think I do. Did somebody else

1429
05:33:50,630 --> 05:34:19,830
crash? Where did you come from? I don't know what else to do. Hold L2. Start with grenade. Nothing

1430
05:34:19,830 --> 05:34:41,979
is going to work. All right. Stop that. I have to restart the mission. Maybe it'll despawn. Get

1431
05:34:41,979 --> 05:35:20,139
out of the car. I think the wheels are touching something. The wheels are touching something.

1432
05:35:20,139 --> 05:35:42,060
Fuck this mission. I'll just redo it. What? Okay. Retry from... I don't know what that is. So,

1433
05:35:42,060 --> 05:36:07,849
I'm going to press backspace. Is it enter? Enter, right? Thank god. Let's go. I thought that was a

1434
05:36:07,849 --> 05:36:52,470
ramp.

1435
05:36:57,830 --> 05:37:07,540
Thank you. The special AR-50 fires grenades using right click. Very cool. That's really cool. What

1436
05:37:07,540 --> 05:37:34,330
is right click again? It's left trigger. It doesn't fail the mission, right? Don't even think about

1437
05:37:34,330 --> 05:38:25,959
going to that same spot. Thank god. Protect the... This blew the car up. I don't know why I did that.

1438
05:38:25,959 --> 05:38:35,000
I don't understand. I don't know what happened. I'm so childish. I just am fucking... I'm childish.

1439
05:38:35,000 --> 05:38:51,400
I'm a child and I have to agree. Jesus. You're a worse driver than I am. Look where my legs are.

1440
05:38:51,400 --> 05:39:20,119
My knees are so high. There's not much to protect us from. What am I protecting us from? One person?

1441
05:39:20,759 --> 05:39:34,180
Don't go that way. Okay. I tried to shoot the car in front of us.

1442
05:39:40,229 --> 05:39:48,069
We're traveling fast so it's going to go back and hit us. We drove into it. There's nothing to even

1443
05:39:48,069 --> 05:39:57,849
fire at so I'm just getting bored. There's nobody after us. I don't even know what they're talking

1444
05:39:57,849 --> 05:40:19,770
about. Oh my god. Were they all stacked in one spot? Did they all spawn there? Holy shit. Oh my

1445
05:40:20,409 --> 05:40:34,860
goodness. I don't think it's supposed to be like this. Jesus Christ. You think that has something

1446
05:40:34,860 --> 05:40:41,459
to do with the fact that they all were stuck in that little ravine and then it spawned them all

1447
05:40:41,459 --> 05:40:47,189
in the same place? If you crash anymore this is going to start to... It's not going to be my fault

1448
05:40:47,189 --> 05:40:55,669
if you do that. You crash again. This is on fire. No. It's gonna... Please be careful. We're very close.

1449
05:40:59,669 --> 05:41:19,299
Okay. Thank god. Remember my mom has a dog

1450
05:41:19,380 --> 05:41:30,490
with a sister? Shout out the dog. Shout out to your sister's dog. I think I misinterpreted that.

1451
05:41:43,909 --> 05:41:54,919
Somebody has an important question. How do I explain the word sus? No, that's not my thing.

1452
05:41:54,919 --> 05:42:27,459
Okay cool. 15 grand. Weapon time. How have I not tried to do this yet? This is incredibly

1453
05:42:27,459 --> 05:42:58,540
surprising that I haven't done this. It works. Holy shit. Okay that's really... Oh I need to go

1454
05:42:58,540 --> 05:43:17,659
get guns right? I don't want heat going in here. What the hell? Oh I thought I just shot electricity

1455
05:43:17,659 --> 05:43:41,080
out of the gun. What? You're good. All right. Why are people like dead in here? Okay you can purchase

1456
05:43:41,159 --> 05:43:53,020
melee weapons. Wait a minute. Oh no. Holy shit. Okay I definitely want this. I want the sludge

1457
05:43:53,020 --> 05:44:20,119
hammer. I want the baseball bat. Okay cool. How do I switch between them? You can only have one

1458
05:44:20,119 --> 05:44:57,659
melee weapon at a time. Can I trade this in? What a bad time to do that. What are you looking at?

1459
05:44:57,659 --> 05:45:23,509
Eat eat eat. Quick quick quick. Oh a titan. Right through. Perfect fit. There's no way you got

1460
05:45:23,509 --> 05:45:49,290
through that too. Three stars. Sorry I got three stars. I'll um damn it. Just go. Nobody is just

1461
05:45:49,290 --> 05:46:05,110
unloading the whole clip. Are they still shooting? Who's still firing? I can't tell who's shooting.

1462
05:46:08,979 --> 05:46:42,840
Who's still firing? Can I get in the bed? Leave me alone. I thought that was gonna hurt me. I need

1463
05:46:42,840 --> 05:46:48,139
to get some more respect. I need... Wait wait wait wait wait. Hold on a minute. I need to... That's a

1464
05:46:48,139 --> 05:47:29,700
store. Okay this place is called Friendly Fire. I want to go there. Nice iPad. I like iPads. Really

1465
05:47:29,700 --> 05:47:55,529
guys. All at once now right? You gotta go with the skid. Are you actually arresting me? Oh fine. I

1466
05:47:55,529 --> 05:48:26,279
don't care. No way. The Andes. I want to do the surf thing. Can I not do the surf thing here?

1467
05:48:31,430 --> 05:49:00,009
Get up there. It looks like I'm stuck in the windshield. Okay enough playing around. Next

1468
05:49:00,009 --> 05:49:13,770
person that runs me over. Freeze. I mean I have I have to do something with this right? Can I buy a

1469
05:49:13,770 --> 05:49:40,759
hot dog? I've just run. I didn't kill him. He's fine. All right we gotta get the hot dog to fight

1470
05:49:40,759 --> 05:49:57,880
somebody. Follow me. No don't run. Don't run. You just wanted to fight me. This is bullshit. I wanted

1471
05:49:57,880 --> 05:50:19,830
you to... You can be the hot dog if you want. Am I actually in trouble again? All right get me over

1472
05:50:19,830 --> 05:50:33,900
there. I need some weapons. Remember you're a big bully only in GTA games. I swear I'm a very sweet

1473
05:50:33,900 --> 05:50:47,220
sweet boy outside of Grand Theft Auto third-person games. I promise. I'm a nice young man outside of

1474
05:50:47,220 --> 05:51:26,950
this. I didn't even see those people. This is far away. Geez. You get respect for bailing out of the

1475
05:51:26,950 --> 05:51:59,380
car. Hi. Can I take the safe? Ooh all right. Pistols. SMG. Shotguns. Rifles. Special. Throne.

1476
05:51:59,380 --> 05:52:17,340
All right I want this thing. This is a 12 gauge. I'm buying it. Okay. You have this weapon. Shotgun

1477
05:52:17,340 --> 05:52:26,419
ammo. I have the... Okay I already have this. Holy shit. Hell yeah. Magnum. I want it. Bad.

1478
05:52:27,139 --> 05:52:46,819
I'm wasting so much money. Check the special weapon cache. What does that mean? Oh I think I'm

1479
05:52:46,819 --> 05:53:00,279
gonna do pistol. All right. I don't want to spend all my money. Wait. Weapon cache. Spacebar.

1480
05:53:00,840 --> 05:53:11,560
Bring to weapons cache. Oh I see what you mean. Okay. Dual 44 shepherds. Are you kidding me?

1481
05:53:11,560 --> 05:53:38,150
Wow. Okay. Double 12 gauge. I want the sledgehammer. This is insane. All right. I definitely want to

1482
05:53:38,150 --> 05:53:53,610
put this on. All right cool. Let's go. That's what I'm talking about. Oh that's sick. All right. Now

1483
05:53:53,610 --> 05:54:11,419
give me all the money in the register. Get to the safe. Thank you. Wait this is not the thing. I

1484
05:54:11,419 --> 05:54:17,209
didn't want to fucking kill that lady. Honest to god damn god. I didn't want to do that. I actually

1485
05:54:17,209 --> 05:54:22,119
didn't want to throw it at her and kill her. And now I don't know what I'm doing. I'm gonna test

1486
05:54:22,119 --> 05:54:36,520
this on you. It works. Why did I do that? Pick up the safe. No. And then I threw... I just wanted

1487
05:54:36,520 --> 05:55:01,049
to get rid of it. What a dumb ass. These things are powerful. Holy shit. Why is it telling me to go

1488
05:55:01,049 --> 05:55:33,799
this way? What the hell? There's only 30 seconds here. This is gonna be tricky. All right. The

1489
05:55:33,799 --> 05:55:44,779
first thing that somebody says is what I'm gonna eat tonight. What is it? I haven't. I didn't even

1490
05:55:44,779 --> 05:55:52,759
look at the chat. I have no idea what you wrote. Dude this one is really hard. I'm not sure I'm

1491
05:55:52,759 --> 05:56:04,009
gonna be able to do this one. Yeah I can't do this one. Holy shit. I got 25 more seconds. I'm an idiot.

1492
05:56:04,729 --> 05:56:30,279
All right. I saw a taco. Sounds pretty good. Don't follow the GPS you donkey. No. Stop it.

1493
05:56:30,279 --> 05:56:36,180
What are you doing? No. Not my Wellington. Three, two, one.

1494
05:56:45,740 --> 05:57:08,340
I got it. I'm not gonna make it. I wasn't getting seconds added. That was horseshit. Stuff cross

1495
05:57:08,340 --> 05:57:32,090
pizza. I'm just testing to see if it works. I have not had Popeyes yet. That's a good idea.

1496
05:57:32,090 --> 05:57:39,020
All right. Let's do a mission. What time is it? Oh shit. It's been a long time. I'm having a good

1497
05:57:39,020 --> 05:57:52,939
time. This is really fun. All right. I'm gonna go to the casino. This is a pretty long drive from

1498
05:57:52,939 --> 05:57:58,970
here. We'll play this again. I'll probably be live at some point in the middle of the week.

1499
05:57:58,970 --> 05:58:04,009
Like Wednesday or Thursday. Keep an eye on the sus. End of the stream voice? Almost. Not quite.

1500
05:58:14,709 --> 05:58:21,830
How do you feel about the asbestos allegations? That I've been like eating it? What are you talking

1501
05:58:21,830 --> 05:58:54,419
about? All right. Here we go. The rain makes the game lag so much. There were people waiting for

1502
05:58:54,419 --> 05:59:21,700
me down that alleyway. Don't let her get out. Did I get it? I got it. Okay. She just exploded I think.

1503
05:59:23,369 --> 05:59:34,869
Oh man. I didn't do it. Okay. I want to try this. I want to get this right.

1504
05:59:43,540 --> 06:00:03,099
I want to see how you do this. All right. Follow to the safe. Go to the safe. What's going on?

1505
06:00:03,099 --> 06:00:16,659
Keep your cursor on its head. Will you go to the safe? All right. There are raccoons in the trash

1506
06:00:16,659 --> 06:00:27,930
outside. They're gonna get me. Go to the safe. All right. Open it up. You all right? Okay. Thank

1507
06:00:27,930 --> 06:00:51,380
you. Is there money in there? Oh, this is a cheeseburger. All right. Oh, nope. Do I know you?

1508
06:00:51,459 --> 06:01:28,380
Oops. You're a psycho. This Saints Row 2. We're not playing Putt-Putt's Great Adventure.

1509
06:01:30,709 --> 06:01:40,119
I'm not playing like a math game. I thought I was going to fall through the middle.

1510
06:01:44,279 --> 06:01:47,479
Oh my god. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

1511
06:01:47,479 --> 06:01:55,159
wait. I gotta get the camera. Is there a camera? I swear to god there's a camera in this game.

1512
06:01:55,159 --> 06:02:32,939
Isn't there? Is there a camera? Is there a camera? Can I get in? Sure. I guess that is fine that it

1513
06:02:32,939 --> 06:03:06,619
happened like that. Who drove the car? A drift. Oh, MonkaW. I can do that one better, I think.

1514
06:03:06,619 --> 06:03:10,700
There's a better way to say that. Instead of like MonkaW. I get kind of caught up a little bit.

1515
06:03:11,419 --> 06:03:20,500
It should be like MonkaW. No, it's gotta be harder, right? Because MonkaW is much closer

1516
06:03:20,500 --> 06:03:31,540
and much more like holy shit. It'll be way more force behind it. I don't know why I thought I

1517
06:03:31,540 --> 06:04:03,270
could climb that. All right. Where's the casino? Let me in. Oh, that's not the entrance.

1518
06:04:04,729 --> 06:04:21,419
Wrong one. Is it this side? Yeah, save the game for sure. That sounds, yeah, MonkaW sounds too

1519
06:04:21,419 --> 06:04:34,139
forced. You're right. No, I completely agree. Where is this building? Where is it? Isn't it this one?

1520
06:04:42,139 --> 06:05:14,060
There it is. Oh, here's every single mukbang video you've ever watched in your entire life.

1521
06:05:47,319 --> 06:05:57,139
That's a lot. That's a lot of what the fuck, dude. Excellent. All right, it's fucking nine thousand

1522
06:05:57,139 --> 06:06:35,959
dollars. 10, 20. Oh, yo, yo. Something's wrong with me. I swear to God. 13, edit. Hey.

1523
06:06:38,060 --> 06:06:47,209
All right. Shut up. I've had enough of that behavior. It's like, just stop it. There's no

1524
06:06:47,209 --> 06:07:09,080
reason to be doing that. Like, why? This is so bad. Okay. Let me get this right here. 18. Oh,

1525
06:07:09,080 --> 06:07:26,549
it means you're going to have 20. You fucking idiot. How did I know? Anytime you play blackjack,

1526
06:07:26,549 --> 06:07:32,229
you always assume the dealer has a 10 underneath. So you just assume that that is a 10 that's not

1527
06:07:32,229 --> 06:07:53,849
shown. What a dog shit hit. I have zero dollars now. I lose. The game crashed. That's probably

1528
06:07:53,849 --> 06:08:02,180
a good place to stop, I think. Right at the exact pretty much six hour mark. That was really fun,

1529
06:08:02,180 --> 06:08:07,130
though. We'll do that again. Maybe we'll do that again at some point in the middle of the week.

1530
06:08:07,130 --> 06:08:16,490
Still trying to keep the twice a week thing going. You can always pretty much assume there'll be

1531
06:08:16,490 --> 06:08:19,830
something on the weekend and then something somewhere in the middle of the week. Somewhere

1532
06:08:19,830 --> 06:08:25,159
like Wednesday, Thursday, and like maybe Sunday. I was thinking about maybe doing Saturday, Sunday,

1533
06:08:25,159 --> 06:08:33,099
but I don't want that much time to pass. Because back three or four months ago, I was doing

1534
06:08:33,099 --> 06:08:42,569
Saturday to Saturday, essentially. I want to really try to get on that one stream every four

1535
06:08:42,569 --> 06:08:52,659
or five days rather than one stream every seven or eight days. We're going to play Saints Row 2

1536
06:08:52,659 --> 06:09:02,200
again because I'm very invested. That was a lot of fun. Hope you enjoyed yourselves. Thanks for

1537
06:09:02,200 --> 06:09:09,959
watching. Here are all the subs today. Thanks, everybody. I no longer call out that many subs

1538
06:09:09,959 --> 06:09:21,580
anymore, but I still really appreciate it. Yeah, we'll see what's going on in the middle of the

1539
06:09:21,580 --> 06:09:29,979
week. I'm either going to play this again or maybe we'll do some co-op stuff. We'll see. I just live

1540
06:09:29,979 --> 06:09:39,240
life by the wings or something. Whatever it is. I just wing it. We'll see you again. Keep an eye on

1541
06:09:39,240 --> 06:09:49,400
the sauce over the next few days. We are going to... Let's raid Ludwig. I want you to tell Ludwig

1542
06:09:49,720 --> 06:10:00,090
we listened to the Christmas album and I thought it was phenomenal. I want you to make sure you

1543
06:10:00,090 --> 06:10:15,349
tell Ludwig that it was really good. And don't... Yeah, don't be stupid. It actually was really good.

1544
06:10:15,349 --> 06:10:20,630
Like, I'm jealous at the musical talent. I really am. I didn't even know he could sing. They can

1545
06:10:20,630 --> 06:10:32,380
say... Like, that's cutie, right? As well. They can sing. Are you guys still... Are you grounded?

1546
06:10:32,380 --> 06:10:36,380
Yeah, you are, because I saw that first part when I raided Vinnie. And you still did it. You're

1547
06:10:36,380 --> 06:10:46,439
grounded. All of you. Every single person collectively. All right. I'll see you guys later.

1548
06:10:46,439 --> 06:10:54,409
Thanks for watching, as always. Go say the Christmas album is fire. And I will see you guys in

1549
06:10:55,430 --> 06:11:27,459
probably a few days. Keep an eye on the sauce. Take care of yourselves. Have a great night.

1550
06:11:27,459 --> 06:11:54,389
Get this to 8K. I want an 8K raid. Influencer Andy. You've got 10 seconds to do it. At least 7,500.

1551
06:11:54,389 --> 06:12:08,970
Come on. I know you guys can do it. Come on. I know you can. There's still so many of you that

1552
06:12:08,970 --> 06:12:26,069
haven't done it. I did my part. Yeah, thank you. Irma, you look kind of like Ernest.
