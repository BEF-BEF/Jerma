1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:28,140
Oh, that was bad. Wait, hold on. That's okay. That's the first time I've, oh, I've spoken. Like, used my vocal cords in at least, I don't know, like 30 minutes. 30 or 40 minutes ago, I went, oh, auto, auto.

2
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:35,340
And I got ready. I haven't used them. Saliva has been down there.

3
00:00:35,340 --> 00:01:00,219
Hello, happy Saturday. How's your weekend? Mine's doing pretty good. You guys ready for this weekend edition of the German 985 television program? Today, we've got an exciting program. This week, we're going to play Xbox games. Some original, some Xbox 360.

4
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:18,060
And let me just right off the bat tell you that yes, yes, we're going to play, I don't even want to say it. We're going to play, yes, we're going to play Sneak King, okay? Everybody relax.

5
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:31,859
I couldn't even say it. I was, I was like, my like voice trembled from like how dumb this is. Like how stupid and shitty this game is. We're going to play Sneak King.

6
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:45,260
Like I'm a fucking toddler, like hiding behind the couch that's very visible and you can see where they go.

7
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:49,439
Yeah, you ready? Yeah, you're never going to be able to find me.

8
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,439
They fucking run away and you see them. You see exactly where they go and then they jump out. You don't even have to find them.

9
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:03,439
You get within a 15 feet circle around where they are and they just jump out and they go, ah!

10
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:14,979
Like yes, okay, you're very excited, I can tell. We're going to start with an Xbox 360 game. I don't know how good this is going to be, by the way.

11
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:22,750
By the way, that the rule does stand on this stream, the general rule. You don't know what the general rule is.

12
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:34,780
We have 30 minutes to play each one of these. After 30 minutes, we decide if we're going to spend six hours. I don't know how it works.

13
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:49,469
It's going to be great. That's a lot of gifts. That is a lot of gifts. That's 20. Oh, my throat is fucked today.

14
00:02:49,469 --> 00:03:04,500
What's going on? I don't know why this happens to me.

15
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:13,669
Anybody else feel like this? I have a like four hour window every single day where my voice is normal.

16
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:19,740
After like four o'clock in the afternoon, it starts to get really kind of like tired.

17
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:26,740
And from four in the afternoon till one a.m. before I go to bed, it's like, oh man, like it's getting a little tired talking.

18
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:32,740
I wake up in the morning and my voice is like this. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

19
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:38,430
And it slowly gets normal for like three hours. Why does it do this? What's wrong with me?

20
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:46,129
I thought it was messed up for yelling for 20 minutes. Well, I didn't yell.

21
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:54,080
Maybe I'm just screaming in my sleep or something. Like screaming every night and I don't even know.

22
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:11,819
Talking to yourself. Smoker lungs. I don't smoke cigarettes. I don't even smoke weed. I don't do it. I don't inhale smoke.

23
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:19,149
That's not a lie. It's not. I don't smoke weed. I already went over this. I don't smoke weed.

24
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:25,149
I eat it in small quantities, controlled so I know exactly what I'm getting.

25
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:34,819
I need to tell you all that again. I haven't caught a stream live in ages. Well, welcome.

26
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:46,730
You're going to notice. I swear to God. So because we're on a once a week schedule, the like three to four hour stream is gone.

27
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:52,850
I'm going to sit here as long as I'm comfortable. That could be five hours. That could be eight.

28
00:04:52,850 --> 00:05:00,730
I don't know. But something you're going to notice over in real time here, you're going to find that for our window.

29
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:07,060
It's not right now. It's going to be in like 45 minutes to an hour. You'll get I want someone to catch it.

30
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:19,410
Anyways, the first game we're going to play is the first Templar for Xbox 360. I don't this game.

31
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:23,410
I don't know anything about it. This is a guy with a shield on the front and he has a sword.

32
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:32,069
And already nobody likes it. I haven't even played it yet.

33
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:39,740
What was I going to say? Somebody had a question. What was I just going to say? I have no idea.

34
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:48,360
This game is bad. Really? You don't even know what this is. You don't know what this is.

35
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:58,639
This looks like a PC like flip. Wait, what do you mean? I didn't catch the whole thing.

36
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,930
Did you say this looks like a Unity flip? Is that what you said?

37
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:11,579
Well, this would be one of the original Unity flips. This game came out before Unity I think even existed.

38
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:17,899
I need to check the sound. I didn't get a chance to do that. Let's go. Ready?

39
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:25,949
One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three.

40
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:32,610
Is it good? Perfect. All right. Here we go.

41
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,189
No game sound. I'm looking at it right now. I can see it.

42
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:41,670
What the hell was I going to say? There was something important that I had to say.

43
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:46,550
Cabbagehead PhD gave 25 community subs. I was in the middle of saying that. Thank you.

44
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,920
What was I going to say? One, two, three. One, two, three.

45
00:06:50,920 --> 00:07:02,629
It should be instant when you hear it. I'm not going to play on casual. Maybe I should.

46
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:05,629
I'm not playing on hard. Normal. Subtitles, sure. Why not?

47
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:09,129
Brightness. Adjust the slider until the middle square is just barely visible.

48
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:20,050
Does anybody play like this? I feel like there's tons of people that just turn the thing all the way up because I can see better.

49
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:26,040
We're just going to go here. I hate not being able to see shit in games. It's annoying.

50
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:33,620
Are you ready? Are you ready for the captivating story of the first temple? That was whatever.

51
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:50,579
You have to wait 30 minutes. You can't just say next. We haven't even seen the intro.

52
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:53,139
Sit down.

53
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,680
Everyone is waiting for Sneak King. What if I just fucked with you all and I had this game custom made?

54
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,680
And it zooms into the king on the throne and it's the Burger King.

55
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,679
See, that's how you don't even know what the fuck you're going to get here. So sit down.

56
00:08:45,200 --> 00:09:03,840
Did I play this game? This guy just woke up. I know what it's like.

57
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:15,950
Let's catch up with this guy in like four hours. He probably sounds like this.

58
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:22,899
Is this the human starting zone in Warcraft?

59
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:33,700
Can you hear that? Oh my god.

60
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,700
It sounds like I'm changing inking my printer over here.

61
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:52,779
The toughness skill grants orbs. You can't hear that?

62
00:09:52,779 --> 00:10:02,129
Cyprus. 1291. Oh, it is a unity flip. You're right.

63
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:09,669
This looks like a machinima. This looks like a very well-made machinima.

64
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:29,190
Wait, somebody killed all these people? Why are they ready to...

65
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:42,649
Why would you close your hands together? Alright, X's attack.

66
00:10:44,909 --> 00:10:49,049
Nice. This is the best machinima I've ever seen.

67
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:56,299
Who's talking? Me? Okay.

68
00:10:56,299 --> 00:11:00,299
Well, this game is not going to be very fun. This is going to be gone in a half an hour, I guarantee it.

69
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:04,690
Playing in a machinima. What, you don't remember that?

70
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:09,269
If you didn't feel like setting all the characters up and stuff,

71
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:15,269
you would go from a cinematic view to just take the HUD away and start fucking slashing at each other and stuff.

72
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:20,769
And you would use that, because how much of a pain in the ass would that be to actually set all that up?

73
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:38,500
Alright, what do I need to do? Is there a sprint? What do I have to do? Just leave?

74
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:50,940
Castle of Griffinstein 2. Oh, here we go. Alright.

75
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,940
You can block enemy attacks by holding down right trigger to block an attack coming from a different direction.

76
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,940
Tilt L in that direction while holding RT down.

77
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:13,769
Alright, that's a block. I just need like a young, like 12 year old voice to narrate what's going on right now.

78
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:15,769
And then it would be a real machinima.

79
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:23,019
Alright, block. With a really puffy mic.

80
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:29,139
What I mean by puffy mic, I mean that every time you say the word, any word with P or T in it,

81
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:32,409
it sounds like your eardrums are blowing up.

82
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:37,779
For example, I'm going to give you a warning here. This is going to be horrible.

83
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:56,409
Okay, so please, please take me to your general so I can push him over the edge.

84
00:12:56,409 --> 00:13:00,720
That's what it was like. That's still kind of what it's like. I'm sorry, this is probably loud.

85
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,600
All the golden arrow on your minimap to your main objective. The minimap is located in the upper left corner of your screen.

86
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:13,639
Alright, let's go. Put a filter on? Maybe I will eventually.

87
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:29,279
This game is so ugly, but like I'm still interested. I'm not giving up yet.

88
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,460
I'm not next game. Wait a minute, just give me a minute.

89
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:37,460
Let me just do it like the fucking 12 year old does a machinima joke and then we'll move on to Sneak King, I guarantee it.

90
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:51,220
Play a Lego game? The dots, orange dots on your minimap represent healing items.

91
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:58,980
They can take food or fresh water. Lego Lord of the Rings?

92
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:03,929
I think a lot of people don't know what one of the next games could be.

93
00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:08,700
And yes, I did make sure they were all backwards compatible.

94
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:19,860
It has to be, like this game is going to be fun, right?

95
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,620
Wilhelm screams.

96
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:32,799
Yo, I got an achievement playing the game and not doing anything.

97
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:41,620
Holy shit, wow, like what you're witnessing right now is like the achievement bubble of 2011 or 2008.

98
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:46,340
Everything was an achievement. Nothing was a real achievement.

99
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:56,889
Challenges, beating the game on hard or something or doing something really crazy, some real achievement.

100
00:14:56,889 --> 00:14:59,889
Nope. Achievement bubble, 2009.

101
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:04,340
You drank a potion for the first time. 100 points.

102
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:09,620
And then it crashed. Hard. We don't care about him anymore.

103
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:24,700
I'm not listening to any of this.

104
00:15:31,049 --> 00:15:37,820
I miss my beloved Xbox. A lot of 360s play most Xbox games.

105
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,590
What's my gamer score? I don't know. Not that high.

106
00:15:55,289 --> 00:16:02,340
I know these are the rules of the order. Game score is minus two. Open your dashboard?

107
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:16,970
How do I see it? It's not just like right here? Left?

108
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:23,450
Hold on, I don't want you to see, what if like my credit card comes up or something? Hold on.

109
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:29,289
I don't want you to see that. I don't want you guys to see my credit card info.

110
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:33,379
But wait, no, no, but I even care.

111
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:39,990
The last credit card I put into this is from like probably like four years ago or something.

112
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:47,330
Do I really care? Alright, I got 3,800 points. Is that good?

113
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:52,659
3,825. What was considered a huge gamer score?

114
00:16:52,659 --> 00:16:58,940
Well, let me put it this way. What was a braggable gamer score?

115
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:13,200
200k? 20k plus? 50k plus? Damn.

116
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:18,660
Well, cool. Let's continue with the story.

117
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:24,539
Oh, the 25 subs from Cabbagehead. Thank you, Cabbagehead, for the insane subs.

118
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,480
50 community subs.

119
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:43,960
Alright, it's time for a prediction. Is there a mod here that can do predictions?

120
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:52,529
Will the guy on my left in the next cutscene do the like, I'm gonna give you a beatdown with his hands like this?

121
00:17:52,529 --> 00:18:01,309
Like he was doing, he did twice. Will he do it a third time in the next cutscene?

122
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:03,309
Hit it up there. Let's see it. I want to see.

123
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:15,319
Ah, you can't even kill NPCs in this game. Game's not even any good. Alright, let's go.

124
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:19,990
That's easy money.

125
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,240
Alright, let's see. Are they any good?

126
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,930
Oh my god. That's another 25 subs.

127
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:48,140
Alright, will he do it?

128
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:56,819
The Xbox fucking sucks. Actually, the Xbox was fantastic.

129
00:18:56,819 --> 00:18:59,190
The original Xbox was insane.

130
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:05,079
The Xbox 360, on the other hand, melted in your house all the time.

131
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:12,109
Do people remember that shit? I think a lot of the younger crowd here might not understand.

132
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:24,069
The Xbox 360, there was just a random, like, probably 20% chance that it would brick itself and die and melt inside.

133
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:28,079
That was not, oh wow, that's crazy.

134
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:36,950
Imagine if the PS5 just fucking melted inside. Like 30% of them. Wrap it up in a towel.

135
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,950
Yeah, and remember the videos of the people opening up the heat sink?

136
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:44,319
Like turning on an Xbox and opening the heat sink up and dropping like an egg in there?

137
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:47,880
And just cooking the egg instantly and it was like made like a fucking souffle?

138
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,400
I remember that video. That's fucking crazy.

139
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,930
Alright, what do I want? How much? I have 1000 XP.

140
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,549
Alright, am I gonna go...

141
00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:03,619
The third attack in this combo can knock down enemies or break their shields.

142
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:08,019
It's boring. I like that one. That's a cleave.

143
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:11,150
Grants an additional zeal orb. Don't care what that is.

144
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:14,970
We're not gonna get far enough into the game to know what that is or care about it.

145
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:27,390
Yeah, this one. Alright, let's go. Are they orcs?

146
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:34,299
Well, how come we don't have a horse? Why don't we have a horse?

147
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:36,299
Didn't people ride horses?

148
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:44,299
Fucking everyone's just walking around. Enemy archers can deal severe damage from a distance.

149
00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:47,670
If you see a targeting mark near you, try to move away from it.

150
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,670
Hold LT down and tilt L in the desired direction.

151
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:56,109
Hold LT down. Oh, alright. This is dodge.

152
00:20:56,109 --> 00:21:03,980
This game reminds me of something.

153
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,980
Do you guys remember the Viking game?

154
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:14,430
Viking. No, there is a mobile game that's like this.

155
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,430
What's this fucking mobile game?

156
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:19,250
There's a mobile game that's this exact game.

157
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,250
I played it for like two straight days and then I was like, I'll never play it.

158
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:26,279
It's a game where you only fight guys like this in an arena.

159
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:28,279
Not Infinity Blade. No, it's something else.

160
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:37,420
No, not Clash of Clans.

161
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,420
Blood and Glory. That's definitely it. You are absolutely correct.

162
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:49,180
How did you get that? You're right.

163
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:55,289
Blood and Glory. Yeah, it's a mobile game.

164
00:21:55,289 --> 00:22:03,480
Usually I would be really happy if mobile games have caught up.

165
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:10,480
Because remember back in 2012, 2013, 2014, having a 3D game on your phone was a huge deal.

166
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:18,490
So if phones are able to make games that look like this now, that's a really huge, awesome technological achievement.

167
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,490
It really is.

168
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:26,490
But they also progressed. Instead of it being like mobile games that are just ten years behind permanently,

169
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:32,299
they were making their own mobile like core engine shit.

170
00:22:32,299 --> 00:22:37,299
And it's like paying five dollars to not have to wait ten minutes to play the next level and shit.

171
00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:42,609
If mobile games just didn't ever do that, I think they would have like been, well they are huge.

172
00:22:42,609 --> 00:22:48,609
And they're huge because it just preys on like gambling and fucking people's like need to not adapt to impatience and shit.

173
00:22:48,609 --> 00:22:56,259
But what I mean is if it just stayed like this, if it was just ten years behind, that would be awesome.

174
00:22:56,259 --> 00:23:04,049
Where am I going? They make the most money.

175
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,049
I know it's like it's just an obscene market. I know.

176
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:21,900
But if they just made games on it with the technology and not just at the same time developed the like vampire parasite neck bite that is all mobile gaming mechanics,

177
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,529
I think they would have, I would have liked it a lot more.

178
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:28,730
Brutal Templar Strike, a powerful version of the Templar Strike.

179
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:32,119
Who cares? Is there a jump?

180
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:41,400
There are some mobile games that are actually really fun too.

181
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,009
Alright.

182
00:23:51,009 --> 00:23:54,019
XXX breaks shields.

183
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:56,829
Okay, so it's been 25 minutes.

184
00:23:56,829 --> 00:24:10,769
I have five minutes to do something interesting or we're going to have to move on because this is just like a really, you know what this makes me want to play?

185
00:24:10,769 --> 00:24:16,660
This makes me want to play Shadow of War.

186
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,660
I mean, what do you mean not enough?

187
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,559
We need a cut scene.

188
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:22,559
Oh shit, that's right.

189
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,559
I was about to just exit the game.

190
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,890
I forgot about the stupid prediction.

191
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:32,069
We do need a cut scene.

192
00:24:32,069 --> 00:24:33,069
That's right.

193
00:24:33,069 --> 00:24:38,069
After the next cut scene, maybe we'll get out of here and we'll put out a sneak king because I'm going to play that for 20 minutes.

194
00:24:38,069 --> 00:24:39,069
You know it.

195
00:24:39,069 --> 00:24:43,420
And then, holy shit, I got a big one for you.

196
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,420
I got a lot of Xbox and Xbox 360 games.

197
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:51,099
Why is that so hard?

198
00:24:51,099 --> 00:24:52,099
Why was it?

199
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:54,680
Who's?

200
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,680
Is this talking?

201
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,680
Who's talking to me?

202
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,779
Why does this guy have a Batman voice?

203
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:05,619
That's just Batman.

204
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:12,420
Alright.

205
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,420
Brutal Templar Strike.

206
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:19,500
I don't have enough mana.

207
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,740
This is stupid.

208
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:25,250
Jeremy, you have to play Halo.

209
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,250
I'm not going to play Halo.

210
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:31,150
I don't like Halo.

211
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,150
Alright.

212
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:34,150
Can we give that a rest finally forever?

213
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:36,150
I don't like the game Halo.

214
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,150
I don't like the game.

215
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,420
I'm sorry.

216
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,420
I know everyone's going to be really mad at me.

217
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,420
I don't like Halo.

218
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,420
It's just a...

219
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,420
I don't like it.

220
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,420
It's not that I hate it.

221
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:51,450
I just don't enjoy playing it.

222
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:55,450
And when you have met with the prospective here of...

223
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:58,690
There's like five Halo games.

224
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,859
And everyone expects you to play them.

225
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:06,579
I'm going to die.

226
00:26:06,579 --> 00:26:08,579
You got your Halo stream when me and Joel played it.

227
00:26:08,579 --> 00:26:11,740
And then that was it.

228
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,740
It's never happening again.

229
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,559
Will you just kill him?

230
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:19,339
It's based gamer cringe.

231
00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:23,460
Look.

232
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,460
I know Halo.

233
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,460
There's a big bunch of fans.

234
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,460
It's got a lot of support.

235
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:33,339
It's considered a very, very good shooter.

236
00:26:33,339 --> 00:26:35,220
I know.

237
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,220
But we don't all have to like the same things.

238
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,529
Your journey ends here.

239
00:26:39,529 --> 00:26:45,259
No opponent's going to make special, more devastating attacks.

240
00:26:45,259 --> 00:26:46,259
The Super X.

241
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:47,890
Yes, we do.

242
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:48,890
No, we don't.

243
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:53,430
Look, if everybody liked the same things,

244
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:56,430
and you wouldn't be able to go watch a movie, love it,

245
00:26:56,430 --> 00:27:01,430
and then go hate read the 30% Rotten Tomatoes critic article

246
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,430
about the movie.

247
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:05,309
You wouldn't be able to do that anymore.

248
00:27:05,309 --> 00:27:09,430
All right.

249
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,430
Watch these icons try to block or dodge.

250
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,430
You got it.

251
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:16,000
No cut scene.

252
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
No, not yet.

253
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,750
Where's this mercenary leader?

254
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:23,589
Is this the leader?

255
00:27:23,589 --> 00:27:31,380
So this is the leader.

256
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:35,160
Here come more of my boys.

257
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,160
Oh, shit.

258
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,160
Here they are.

259
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,160
Here they are, the boys.

260
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:42,920
Uh-oh.

261
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,920
I'm going to die.

262
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,220
Where is there a drink fountain?

263
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:49,059
It's the boys.

264
00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:51,059
Isn't that from Warhammer?

265
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:57,420
Boston.

266
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,420
Oh, my God.

267
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,420
Kill him.

268
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,730
Reload has been knocked out?

269
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:04,500
What do you mean, reload?

270
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,500
Go to the knocked out character

271
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,500
and perform the revive action to help them.

272
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,680
If you don't help your fallen teammate in time,

273
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,680
you will lose the game.

274
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,680
What?

275
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:19,619
How the fuck am I supposed to revive him?

276
00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:26,269
I can't revive him.

277
00:28:26,269 --> 00:28:30,990
Not enough zeal?

278
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:31,990
Did I get him?

279
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:34,130
Look at this fucking bubble.

280
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:46,420
Are you kidding me?

281
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,420
Ah!

282
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:51,859
What?

283
00:28:51,859 --> 00:28:52,859
Cutscene?

284
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:55,859
Oh, cutscene!

285
00:28:55,859 --> 00:29:05,109
I said open it, you fucking psycho!

286
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:13,049
That door sucks.

287
00:29:13,049 --> 00:29:16,630
You could lean a vacuum against that door

288
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:17,630
and it would fall over.

289
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,630
Really?

290
00:29:23,089 --> 00:29:24,089
He's going to do it.

291
00:29:33,569 --> 00:29:34,569
Ah!

292
00:29:40,349 --> 00:29:41,349
He did it!

293
00:29:41,349 --> 00:29:42,589
Yes!

294
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,960
How could you bet against one of his four animations?

295
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,960
How dare you?

296
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,960
What are you thinking?

297
00:30:02,329 --> 00:30:03,329
Why the seagulls?

298
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:17,630
Is somebody like 15 feet to the right of us?

299
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:21,630
Who has like a burger basket from the boardwalk at the beach?

300
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:24,630
And there's just seagulls just fucking attacking this guy.

301
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:25,630
Get away from me!

302
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,630
No, these are my french fries!

303
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,630
Ow!

304
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:30,630
No!

305
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:34,059
Honey, honey, get him off me!

306
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:38,690
He like throws the basket of food to get away and run,

307
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:39,690
otherwise he's just going to get murdered.

308
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:48,140
Why are we coming back here?

309
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:53,319
Oh, it's been 30 minutes.

310
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,390
Honey, save yourself!

311
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:03,890
Honey, get the kids!

312
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:11,839
Next game?

313
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:13,839
No, not yet.

314
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:22,480
Wait, we have a new area.

315
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,480
No, not yet.

316
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,480
Just give me a minute.

317
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:34,779
Congratulations, 16 million.

318
00:31:34,779 --> 00:31:37,779
Going across to 1700 people.

319
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:41,109
You guys can't hear that.

320
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:42,109
Really?

321
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:43,109
Are you sure?

322
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:48,829
Finish this game.

323
00:31:48,829 --> 00:31:49,829
I'm not going to...

324
00:31:49,829 --> 00:31:50,829
No.

325
00:31:50,829 --> 00:32:00,150
By the way, I also had the Burger King bumper cars game.

326
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:02,150
But I think I threw it in the trash accidentally.

327
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:04,150
I actually think I threw it away.

328
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,150
I don't know, I can't find it.

329
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:08,150
Find and slay the beast.

330
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:11,150
We have to see who the beast is, right?

331
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:14,029
Kill the beast.

332
00:32:14,029 --> 00:32:15,029
Yes.

333
00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:16,029
No, I'm sorry, we're not going anywhere.

334
00:32:16,029 --> 00:32:17,029
Not yet.

335
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,710
No, guys, don't worry.

336
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,710
I'm not like a three to four hour Andy anymore.

337
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:30,710
Like, I'm doing once a week streams.

338
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:31,710
I'm here.

339
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:32,710
We've got time.

340
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:33,710
Don't worry.

341
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,980
What, the racing one?

342
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:50,160
I thought I had two or three of them.

343
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:59,799
Oh, and that was a bird noise.

344
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,240
Did he fall off?

345
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:25,819
I don't know.

346
00:33:25,819 --> 00:33:26,819
They seem to be done.

347
00:33:26,819 --> 00:33:30,940
They've ran out.

348
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,940
They ran...

349
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,900
Look out!

350
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,720
They used all their arrows in one volley.

351
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,940
I once got hit right in the head with an arrow.

352
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:44,940
Don't you?

353
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,940
Won't this make it worth it?

354
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,940
It'll make everything worth it, won't it?

355
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,700
If an arrow goes through his neck

356
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,700
and gives him Frankenstein bolts,

357
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,700
this will be worth it.

358
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,700
Ow!

359
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,700
Fuck, it hit me.

360
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,150
Come on.

361
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,150
Please, just hit this guy in the neck with an arrow.

362
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,150
That's all I want.

363
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:04,150
I got to try to stand right next to him

364
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,150
so it can't hit me.

365
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:17,079
God damn it!

366
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:18,079
No, hit him!

367
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,079
He's in the fucking way.

368
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,079
Why are they hitting me first?

369
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:23,079
He's standing in front of me.

370
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:32,380
Shoot him.

371
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:35,159
You...

372
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,840
They keep hitting us in the chest.

373
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,840
Fuck, I missed it.

374
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,840
Did we see it?

375
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:50,199
What's this?

376
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,199
Eat berries?

377
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,199
You don't eat random berries?

378
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,199
You don't know where they...

379
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:59,280
All right, can you imagine being one of these archers

380
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,280
and you've watched four arrows connect through this guy's chest

381
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,280
and stomach and stuff and he's still running up here?

382
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,539
Dogs.

383
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:09,539
Why are dogs just unfriendly?

384
00:35:14,769 --> 00:35:16,070
Help me!

385
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:21,510
Wait, what?

386
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,780
Why is he dead?

387
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:31,369
They're not dead.

388
00:35:31,369 --> 00:35:32,369
That's like...

389
00:35:32,369 --> 00:35:33,369
They're playing dead.

390
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:47,340
A chest by an open fire.

391
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,340
Brutal frenzy boon.

392
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,340
Until the end of this chapter,

393
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,340
Roland has been granted brutal frenzy,

394
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,340
a powerful version of the frenzy skill.

395
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,340
Frenzy gives Roland a damage boost.

396
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:59,420
This is the shittiest chest I've ever seen in a video game.

397
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:02,780
You're telling me that inside of these chests

398
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:08,360
are motivational notes?

399
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:12,969
Who's the fucking asshole that did that?

400
00:36:12,969 --> 00:36:13,969
There's no gold pieces,

401
00:36:13,969 --> 00:36:16,969
potions, armor, jewels.

402
00:36:16,969 --> 00:36:18,980
No.

403
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,980
It's motivational poetry.

404
00:36:22,539 --> 00:36:32,519
They're fortune cookie chests.

405
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:39,219
Well, at least spin the paper around

406
00:36:39,219 --> 00:36:41,219
and see what your lucky numbers are.

407
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:45,469
Wait, these are villagers?

408
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:48,179
Well, he's...

409
00:36:49,179 --> 00:36:50,179
What?

410
00:36:51,869 --> 00:36:52,869
I mean, judgmental.

411
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:55,820
Where are my coins?

412
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:04,159
I think he didn't bet on that.

413
00:37:18,219 --> 00:37:19,219
That guy's way closer to his microphone

414
00:37:19,219 --> 00:37:21,219
than everybody else in the whole game.

415
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:29,670
I'm staying right here.

416
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:32,039
No one will make me leave my home.

417
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:33,039
Okay.

418
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:42,619
Those are the Frosty King.

419
00:37:42,619 --> 00:37:43,619
Are there choices?

420
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:45,619
All right, are there choices?

421
00:37:45,619 --> 00:37:48,440
There are no choices in this game.

422
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,440
Too bad.

423
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:55,539
Next game?

424
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:58,539
I'm not going next game until we beat the beast.

425
00:37:58,539 --> 00:37:59,539
Whoever the beast is,

426
00:37:59,539 --> 00:38:02,539
and it's supposed to be this big giant mythical creature,

427
00:38:02,539 --> 00:38:06,539
but it's gonna be just kind of a big guy with a flail.

428
00:38:06,539 --> 00:38:08,980
That's who the beast is, in quotes.

429
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,780
$50,000 says I could do more trivia than you.

430
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:23,559
$100,000.

431
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:27,559
$90,000 says I'm faster than you.

432
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:35,139
Oh, yeah, beast?

433
00:38:35,139 --> 00:38:37,139
I graduated from Yale.

434
00:38:37,139 --> 00:38:38,139
Bring it on.

435
00:38:38,139 --> 00:38:40,820
And they get every question wrong.

436
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:45,429
I don't want to kill these dogs.

437
00:38:45,429 --> 00:38:51,340
I felt like I was alive for a second.

438
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,340
I thought, okay.

439
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,650
There's a skeleton in here.

440
00:38:54,650 --> 00:39:08,300
Let me do the talking.

441
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,300
Don't give up, skeleton.

442
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:15,619
Read sign.

443
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:17,239
Oh, it's gonna be like,

444
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:18,239
this is my chest.

445
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:19,239
Please don't steal.

446
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:30,400
Here we go.

447
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,280
Here comes drama.

448
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,030
Welcome, Templars.

449
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:37,340
Have you seen the beast?

450
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,340
Is it near?

451
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,699
No, we haven't.

452
00:39:39,699 --> 00:39:42,070
No, we are looking for it.

453
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:44,260
You're mad.

454
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,260
We're glad you're safe and sound here.

455
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,260
I like this game.

456
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,260
We can take care of ourselves.

457
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,559
Your swords, I can see.

458
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:52,559
Why are there so many animals in here?

459
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:54,800
Take them and save me.

460
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,800
The beast slaughters anyone in sight.

461
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,800
No, no, no.

462
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,800
That's, excuse me.

463
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,800
That's like go-to bed relaxation sounds.

464
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,579
I'm waiting for the,

465
00:40:06,579 --> 00:40:08,579
where do they start playing the ocean one?

466
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:10,579
With a light thunderstorm.

467
00:40:19,869 --> 00:40:20,869
He's here.

468
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,380
Wait, let me skip to the chase here.

469
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,380
How many legs does the beast have?

470
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,380
Two.

471
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,380
He has two legs.

472
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,380
He has two legs.

473
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,380
He doesn't want you to come over.

474
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,380
He does not want you to come fight him.

475
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,559
And he does not care.

476
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:42,559
Mr. Pirate.

477
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:45,590
It's going to be a person.

478
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,590
It's not going to be an animal.

479
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,400
It's not going to,

480
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,400
it's going to be a human with a flail.

481
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,400
It's going to, oh wow.

482
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,400
It's a beast.

483
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,400
We've seen this movie 5,000 times.

484
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,860
Crack the beast to its lair.

485
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,250
Look around.

486
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:11,119
Oh, what's in here?

487
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,119
Jewels?

488
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:15,190
You have found a health burn.

489
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:17,190
You'll have one additional health orb

490
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,190
until the end of this level.

491
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:20,880
It's because you say it doesn't mean it's real.

492
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:30,500
It's a guy.

493
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,500
That's a guy.

494
00:41:34,699 --> 00:41:42,909
I hope they use that.

495
00:41:42,909 --> 00:41:43,909
Please use it.

496
00:41:43,909 --> 00:41:49,019
It's my favorite sound.

497
00:41:49,019 --> 00:41:57,940
Someone is in trouble.

498
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,940
This guy's going to be 12 stone.

499
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:04,610
Hey, here comes the guy.

500
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:06,300
All right.

501
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,300
Prediction time.

502
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,300
Let's let's have you guys spend a little bit,

503
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,300
a little bit of money.

504
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:13,110
Is the beast an animal?

505
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,110
Yes or no.

506
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:19,619
Is the beast an animal or monster?

507
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:21,619
Like, is, well, how about it?

508
00:42:21,619 --> 00:42:22,619
Let me fix this.

509
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:24,619
Is the beast humanoid?

510
00:42:24,619 --> 00:42:27,619
Like a human or like a human creature?

511
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:30,070
Is it like a bear?

512
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,820
Is the beast a bear?

513
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,190
Is that better?

514
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:35,500
How do I word this the best

515
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,500
so the semantics people don't get mad at me?

516
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:45,300
Is the beast a guy?

517
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,949
Humanoid or beast?

518
00:42:47,949 --> 00:42:48,949
All right.

519
00:42:48,949 --> 00:42:49,949
That's a good one.

520
00:42:49,949 --> 00:42:50,949
Is it?

521
00:42:50,949 --> 00:42:56,420
No, no, no.

522
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,420
It has to be yes or no.

523
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,420
Does it have more than two legs?

524
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,659
Okay.

525
00:42:59,659 --> 00:43:00,829
That's good.

526
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:01,829
Bipedal.

527
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:02,829
That's the one.

528
00:43:02,829 --> 00:43:03,829
Is the?

529
00:43:03,829 --> 00:43:04,829
No, because it could be like a stand up bear

530
00:43:04,829 --> 00:43:06,829
like walking around with like hands.

531
00:43:06,829 --> 00:43:08,650
No, no, no.

532
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:09,650
More than two legs is not.

533
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:10,650
I don't think that's fair.

534
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:15,000
Humanoid is the beast humanoid?

535
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Done.

536
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
That's what it is.

537
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:26,179
It's human.

538
00:43:26,179 --> 00:43:28,179
Humanoid is subjective.

539
00:43:28,179 --> 00:43:29,179
All right.

540
00:43:29,179 --> 00:43:31,179
Is the beast human?

541
00:43:31,179 --> 00:43:33,539
Yes or no?

542
00:43:33,539 --> 00:43:35,539
Why are we complicating this?

543
00:43:35,539 --> 00:43:37,780
You guys just stand to lose a shitload of money.

544
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:41,460
Does it matter?

545
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,460
Does the beast have feathers?

546
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:46,909
This is a big bird.

547
00:43:46,909 --> 00:43:52,610
Being a human is subjective.

548
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:56,409
Please.

549
00:43:56,409 --> 00:43:58,289
All right.

550
00:43:58,289 --> 00:43:59,289
Is the beast human?

551
00:43:59,289 --> 00:44:01,550
Is the beast human?

552
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:02,550
Yes or no?

553
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:04,110
I like that.

554
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:05,110
Wait.

555
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:06,110
I don't want to give away any spoilers.

556
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,670
Because that guy next to me could be like,

557
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:12,670
Oh, yeah, that sounds just like the wolves in my town.

558
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:20,889
Is the beast human?

559
00:44:20,889 --> 00:44:33,880
Does the beast come from?

560
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,179
What do you mean by human?

561
00:44:36,179 --> 00:44:37,179
All right.

562
00:44:37,179 --> 00:44:45,269
Here we go.

563
00:44:45,269 --> 00:44:49,650
It's too quiet.

564
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:53,599
Does the beast feel?

565
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:54,599
Oh, the beast slayer.

566
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:55,599
Okay.

567
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:56,599
This is like a castle.

568
00:44:56,599 --> 00:45:00,210
Ambush the beast here.

569
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:01,210
Yeah.

570
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:02,210
We're going to jump out.

571
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:03,210
It's going to be a guy holding firewood.

572
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:04,380
Walking back.

573
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,380
Walking back with a big axe or something.

574
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,380
He's going to be a big guy, right?

575
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:10,559
He's going to be holding firewood.

576
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:12,559
Walking slowly with the firewood.

577
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:14,860
And we're going to realize it's a human.

578
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:15,860
That's what's going to happen.

579
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:22,519
That's like a big guy.

580
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:25,079
Is that a guy?

581
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:27,079
That's a big guy, right?

582
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:30,340
That's just a huge guy.

583
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:31,780
What is it?

584
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:35,190
Is it a guy?

585
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:37,880
That's just a guy.

586
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:42,360
It's just a big huge...

587
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:50,170
Wait, don't close the prediction yet.

588
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:51,170
We don't know.

589
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:53,750
We can't tell yet.

590
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,750
I don't know if it's a human or not.

591
00:45:55,750 --> 00:46:01,280
Not human.

592
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,280
But it could be.

593
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,280
What if it is?

594
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,280
We don't know.

595
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,280
You don't know that yet.

596
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:11,190
Just wait till he talks.

597
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:12,190
It's a troll.

598
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:13,190
We don't know what it is yet.

599
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:14,190
We don't know.

600
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:15,190
It's just the beast right now.

601
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:17,190
We're going to bring him down to like 10% health.

602
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:21,429
And we're going to get like a fucking Psycho Mantis monologue.

603
00:46:21,429 --> 00:46:22,429
Just wait.

604
00:46:22,429 --> 00:46:36,380
I didn't even knock him down.

605
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:38,710
That was him.

606
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:43,659
Fuck off, mate.

607
00:46:43,659 --> 00:46:49,739
How could you hate dogs?

608
00:46:49,739 --> 00:46:58,579
See, who's dead?

609
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:02,800
What?

610
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:03,800
Pump?

611
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:04,800
Why does that say...

612
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,980
What do you mean, pump?

613
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:07,980
I can't revive him.

614
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:08,980
Hurry!

615
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:10,340
I need to revive him!

616
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:12,340
How do I build up my meter?

617
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:19,170
Oh my god, he stomped on me.

618
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,170
Revive him!

619
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,170
I need to revive that guy.

620
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:24,170
He's going to die.

621
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:29,099
How do I build my meter?

622
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:31,099
Get the fuck off of me!

623
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:40,380
Oh my god, he's going to die.

624
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:50,769
How much time do I have before he is dead?

625
00:47:50,769 --> 00:47:51,769
Wait, what?

626
00:47:51,769 --> 00:47:56,309
Where are we restarting from?

627
00:48:03,309 --> 00:48:04,309
He's human.

628
00:48:04,309 --> 00:48:05,309
I don't know!

629
00:48:06,309 --> 00:48:07,309
Wait, what do you mean?

630
00:48:07,309 --> 00:48:10,579
Do I have to start all the way back here?

631
00:48:10,579 --> 00:48:11,579
No, we don't.

632
00:48:11,579 --> 00:48:14,289
He's a troll.

633
00:48:14,289 --> 00:48:16,289
I need to beat him so we can confirm that.

634
00:48:16,289 --> 00:48:17,289
Let's go.

635
00:48:18,289 --> 00:48:19,289
He's a pretty one.

636
00:48:19,289 --> 00:48:20,289
The beast.

637
00:48:20,289 --> 00:48:22,289
This could be just a guy.

638
00:48:22,289 --> 00:48:25,489
It's very possible this is a guy.

639
00:48:25,489 --> 00:48:28,880
Like the witch!

640
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,880
The witch in the woods turned me into this.

641
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,880
I didn't want to be like this, fellas.

642
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:51,820
It was the witch and her dark heart.

643
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:53,829
He's stuck.

644
00:48:53,829 --> 00:48:54,829
Watch out for the dogs.

645
00:48:54,829 --> 00:48:56,329
You good?

646
00:48:56,329 --> 00:48:59,780
Can I block?

647
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:04,860
Watch out!

648
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:05,860
Watch out!

649
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:06,860
Watch out!

650
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:15,769
Watch out!

651
00:49:15,769 --> 00:49:16,769
Watch out!

652
00:49:16,769 --> 00:49:17,769
Watch out!

653
00:49:17,769 --> 00:49:19,070
Watch out!

654
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:20,070
Watch out!

655
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:29,949
Get up!

656
00:49:29,949 --> 00:49:30,949
He's angry.

657
00:49:30,949 --> 00:49:32,380
Uh oh.

658
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:33,380
Ah, you mammoth.

659
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:43,280
He didn't say die, troll.

660
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,280
Oh my god, he's going to die.

661
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,099
Can I revive him?

662
00:49:46,099 --> 00:49:49,909
Come on, I got to revive him and go southbound.

663
00:49:49,909 --> 00:49:52,280
Give me a break.

664
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:56,909
Not enough.

665
00:49:56,909 --> 00:49:57,909
I have a full one.

666
00:49:57,909 --> 00:50:07,690
Watch out for the dogs.

667
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:11,940
He's stuck.

668
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:12,940
Get him.

669
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:20,320
He's stuck.

670
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,070
Knocked down.

671
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:23,380
Okay, here we go.

672
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:24,380
This is it.

673
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:27,920
All right, who is he?

674
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,920
He's like the butcher in the town.

675
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:38,409
He's like the barber or something.

676
00:50:38,409 --> 00:50:44,000
But what is it?

677
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:51,550
No way.

678
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:52,550
He did it.

679
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,550
That's canon in the game.

680
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:56,550
He's human.

681
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:57,550
He's human.

682
00:50:57,550 --> 00:50:58,550
He didn't say troll.

683
00:50:58,550 --> 00:50:59,550
He didn't say ogre.

684
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:00,550
He said human.

685
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:06,380
Game over.

686
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:10,380
Oh man, that's unfortunate that he said human.

687
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:17,449
Can I go in?

688
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:18,449
It is blocked.

689
00:51:18,449 --> 00:51:23,460
I'm broke.

690
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:27,150
He was making all those kinds of like troll noises too.

691
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:31,150
I'm so sorry everybody, but it was confirmed in game that he was a human.

692
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:35,139
Game sucks.

693
00:51:35,139 --> 00:51:36,139
Next game.

694
00:51:36,139 --> 00:51:37,139
Now.

695
00:51:37,139 --> 00:51:44,460
Look, you can be mad and annoyed.

696
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:50,110
Hold on.

697
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:53,079
Not yet.

698
00:51:53,079 --> 00:51:55,079
I don't have my fill of this game yet.

699
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:58,880
Oh Jesus.

700
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:03,400
He just got crushed.

701
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:10,610
That was a really weird cut.

702
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:13,809
That was anime intro cut.

703
00:52:13,809 --> 00:52:19,210
That was right before the breakdown.

704
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:22,210
That's when it's like...

705
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:24,639
And it cuts to like the next part.

706
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:27,820
Where like this shows like the animated fighting and stuff.

707
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:38,760
Why do you hate us so much?

708
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:42,760
I'm enjoying my video game called Templars.

709
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:46,539
I don't even know what it's called.

710
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:49,030
Melting in my seat watching this.

711
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:50,030
You're fine.

712
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:51,030
You're fine.

713
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:52,030
Turn the AC on.

714
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:54,460
Put a fan in your room.

715
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:55,460
I don't know.

716
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:57,980
You're going to be fine.

717
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:58,980
Ow.

718
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:01,179
What?

719
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:20,840
Oh.

720
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:21,840
I got you.

721
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:26,639
Watch out for this one, dude.

722
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:27,639
Careful.

723
00:53:27,639 --> 00:53:32,340
Uh oh.

724
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:38,059
Dogs.

725
00:53:38,059 --> 00:53:39,059
That sounded like a sneeze.

726
00:53:39,059 --> 00:53:49,510
Didn't work.

727
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:50,510
What?

728
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:57,210
Hey, are these dogs human or not?

729
00:53:57,210 --> 00:54:03,250
More dogs.

730
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:08,070
Oh my god.

731
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:10,070
I hate this part.

732
00:54:10,070 --> 00:54:16,219
Get them off me.

733
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:18,219
The next chapter I'm done.

734
00:54:18,219 --> 00:54:19,219
I don't know.

735
00:54:19,219 --> 00:54:22,179
I'm having fun.

736
00:54:22,179 --> 00:54:23,179
Where's your clues?

737
00:54:23,179 --> 00:54:32,079
Something may be hidden nearby.

738
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:33,079
Keep your eyes open.

739
00:54:33,079 --> 00:54:34,079
Something may be hidden.

740
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:35,079
Oh no.

741
00:54:35,079 --> 00:54:37,260
I have to find the hidden chest.

742
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:39,690
Please stop playing this game.

743
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:43,460
I beg you.

744
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:44,460
Begging me?

745
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:46,460
You're begging me to stop playing?

746
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:47,460
I'm sorry.

747
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:52,690
There are no negotiations right now.

748
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:54,690
There is no such thing as a negotiation right now.

749
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:59,440
We've crossed the 30 minute mark, which means I'll be here for six hours.

750
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,440
That's how this game works.

751
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,440
Just kidding.

752
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,809
Don't take that seriously, please.

753
00:55:04,809 --> 00:55:06,809
If you do, then I don't know what to tell you.

754
00:55:06,809 --> 00:55:11,710
I don't know what I can do to tell you.

755
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:15,659
This is where we're going to find out who the bad guy of the game is.

756
00:55:15,659 --> 00:55:18,900
We're going to find out who the beast was, right?

757
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:23,650
He was cursed by a witch, by a warlock,

758
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:29,909
and they're cursing people in the town, turning them into humans, monsters.

759
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:34,780
And stand a chance against the beast.

760
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:41,110
Your monsters stand a chance against our swords.

761
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:46,780
I'm not going to complete the game.

762
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:49,780
I have to play Sneak King for at least 20 minutes.

763
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:53,780
Listen, our holy sword, will you take it?

764
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:57,539
You don't have to repay us.

765
00:55:57,539 --> 00:56:02,019
100% platinum.

766
00:56:02,019 --> 00:56:04,019
Trying to pawn off a rusty blade.

767
00:56:04,019 --> 00:56:09,380
Oh, she said it.

768
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:12,260
No one's seen him ever since.

769
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:14,820
Let's see.

770
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:20,130
That voice, I love this voice.

771
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:22,940
He sounds like somebody.

772
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:28,730
Disney character.

773
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:36,219
Oh, go to the outfit screen.

774
00:56:36,219 --> 00:56:37,219
Employ uniform.

775
00:56:37,219 --> 00:56:41,820
Commander arms.

776
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:44,820
Collect all pieces to unlock the weapon.

777
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:54,000
Why even have this?

778
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
There are 50 gifted subs.

779
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,179
Holy shit, from Zyxia.

780
00:57:01,179 --> 00:57:05,489
We have 50 immunity subs.

781
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:19,889
Do I have to fight them?

782
00:57:19,889 --> 00:57:25,630
I don't even have to fight them.

783
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:26,630
Can I leave?

784
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:41,119
Well, I think I messed everything up here.

785
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,119
Say something funny.

786
00:57:42,119 --> 00:57:44,769
All right.

787
00:57:44,769 --> 00:57:46,769
I just switched characters.

788
00:57:46,769 --> 00:57:51,119
I switched characters to revive.

789
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:52,119
What?

790
00:57:52,119 --> 00:58:01,019
All right, so I have to revive him now.

791
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:26,610
Isn't the one-eyed man, isn't that Bigfoot?

792
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:28,610
The person doesn't exist.

793
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:39,420
Why use that there?

794
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:45,420
Why put that there of all the places?

795
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:48,420
It was such a weird place to put that.

796
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:02,329
Spugleberry.

797
00:59:02,329 --> 00:59:04,329
Oh, excuse me.

798
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:23,900
Here it comes.

799
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:31,130
This audio seems...

800
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:36,860
They're all talking from weird directions.

801
00:59:49,019 --> 00:59:54,550
So loud.

802
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:06,760
Sound mixing.

803
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,760
Yeah, the sound mixing is very bad.

804
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,190
So loud.

805
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:35,940
No.

806
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:41,539
Before, I would have been doing it three or four hours ago.

807
01:00:48,139 --> 01:00:51,719
Speak to Brother Lorenzo.

808
01:00:51,719 --> 01:00:52,719
Wait, one of you guys, Brother Lorenzo?

809
01:00:52,719 --> 01:00:53,719
No.

810
01:00:53,719 --> 01:00:54,719
I'm almost done.

811
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:57,369
I promise.

812
01:00:57,369 --> 01:00:58,369
There really is Geralt.

813
01:00:58,369 --> 01:01:06,989
That's who it was.

814
01:01:06,989 --> 01:01:07,989
Oh, hurry up.

815
01:01:07,989 --> 01:01:11,980
Where's Lorenzo?

816
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:15,079
Don't touch that.

817
01:01:15,079 --> 01:01:16,079
Don't touch stuff.

818
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:28,690
I'm not going to sit here and listen to a thousand years of lore.

819
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:31,659
Where's the sermon?

820
01:01:31,659 --> 01:01:36,139
This is very mediocre.

821
01:01:36,139 --> 01:01:38,699
Well, when did this come out?

822
01:01:38,699 --> 01:01:42,449
I'm going to say 2008.

823
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:43,449
2009?

824
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:48,480
Thousand and...

825
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:51,300
Thousand and...

826
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,880
Where's the thing?

827
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:54,880
It doesn't say what year.

828
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:55,880
What year did this come out?

829
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,880
I can't see it on the back of the box.

830
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:58,880
2001?

831
01:01:58,880 --> 01:01:59,880
No, it's not.

832
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,889
2011.

833
01:02:01,889 --> 01:02:02,889
Yeah, there it is.

834
01:02:02,889 --> 01:02:04,889
That's ten years old.

835
01:02:04,889 --> 01:02:08,920
Which is the greatest sin?

836
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:14,289
To torture a man's body, to save his soul, or to stand idle?

837
01:02:14,289 --> 01:02:17,280
Devil consumes him.

838
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:21,280
If you, the righteous, do not oppose the devil...

839
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,289
How old is Skyrim?

840
01:02:23,289 --> 01:02:25,289
...evil still lives.

841
01:02:25,289 --> 01:02:29,460
But now the Inquisition stands against it.

842
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:33,090
I can see the purifying flames...

843
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:34,090
Watch that cuff.

844
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:35,090
Watch that cuff.

845
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:38,090
...I can see a future free of the devil.

846
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:39,840
Same year?

847
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:40,840
The same year?

848
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:48,440
Bless you all.

849
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:50,440
Bioshock came out before this?

850
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:56,329
I don't know why I did that.

851
01:02:56,329 --> 01:03:00,019
What brings you here, Templar Brothers?

852
01:03:00,019 --> 01:03:02,320
Slade the Beast.

853
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,320
Slade the Beast.

854
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:07,400
Praise the Lord.

855
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,900
Your deed will be well remembered, Inquisition.

856
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:17,190
Please 100% play through Sneak King rather than one more minute of this.

857
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:18,190
Alright, fine.

858
01:03:18,190 --> 01:03:19,190
We've lost an hour.

859
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:21,190
I got what I wanted out of this.

860
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:22,190
I thought it was fun.

861
01:03:22,190 --> 01:03:24,190
But it's time to put in...

862
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:25,190
The Inquisition.

863
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:26,190
Sneak King.

864
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:30,699
I thought it was fun.

865
01:03:30,699 --> 01:03:32,829
Wait.

866
01:03:32,829 --> 01:03:35,829
Follow Brother Lorenzo to find out more information about Marie's location.

867
01:03:35,829 --> 01:03:36,829
Approach with caution.

868
01:03:36,829 --> 01:03:38,829
Because getting too close will make him suspicious.

869
01:03:38,829 --> 01:03:42,829
But don't fall too far behind or you'll lose him along with all the hopes of finding Marie.

870
01:03:44,199 --> 01:03:47,820
Oh, it's a fucking escort quest.

871
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:59,969
We can't fail it.

872
01:04:01,969 --> 01:04:07,099
It really is an Assassin's Creed walk behind the guy mission.

873
01:04:07,099 --> 01:04:10,070
Stop, please.

874
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:11,070
But wait.

875
01:04:11,070 --> 01:04:12,070
I need to see what happens.

876
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:23,079
Alright, fine.

877
01:04:23,079 --> 01:04:24,079
Fine, fine, fine, fine.

878
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:30,119
I'll stop.

879
01:04:30,119 --> 01:04:31,119
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.

880
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:34,300
I just want to see what happens if he gets really annoyed.

881
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:39,840
Like, if I click on him enough times, is he going to do a funny response?

882
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,840
Or he makes like a fart noise and goes like,

883
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:42,840
Oh, sorry.

884
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:43,840
That was me.

885
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:44,840
Stop.

886
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:45,840
Stop it.

887
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:46,840
Get out of here.

888
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:47,840
Leave me alone.

889
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:48,840
You're annoying.

890
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:49,840
Hello?

891
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:50,840
Can I help you?

892
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:51,840
Praise God.

893
01:04:51,840 --> 01:05:04,340
Alright.

894
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:05,340
Alright, alright, alright.

895
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:06,340
Okay, okay, okay.

896
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:07,340
Okay.

897
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:12,099
Listen, you're hearing the, you heard the case open.

898
01:05:12,099 --> 01:05:14,980
This is the Sneak King CD.

899
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:15,980
It's about to go in.

900
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:22,210
Here we go.

901
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:26,260
Is this synced up?

902
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:27,260
Is the audio synced up?

903
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:28,260
I didn't really get a chance to see that.

904
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:30,780
Don't lie to me.

905
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:31,780
I want to make sure it looks good.

906
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:44,030
We'll fix it.

907
01:05:44,030 --> 01:05:45,269
Is it?

908
01:05:45,269 --> 01:05:46,269
Is it bad?

909
01:05:46,269 --> 01:05:50,389
Tested it earlier.

910
01:05:50,389 --> 01:05:53,389
Yeah, but people just say go because they don't want to wait like five minutes.

911
01:05:53,389 --> 01:06:03,590
Alright.

912
01:06:03,590 --> 01:06:04,590
When did this game come out?

913
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:09,010
You know, I know this game has been a meme.

914
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:13,179
It was a meme when it came out, but I never played it.

915
01:06:13,179 --> 01:06:18,150
I don't, I have no idea what this game, I know you like sneak around in like trash cans

916
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:19,150
and stuff.

917
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:21,030
2006.

918
01:06:21,030 --> 01:06:26,730
This is terrifying.

919
01:06:26,730 --> 01:06:31,809
Remove the context of the Burger King.

920
01:06:31,809 --> 01:06:35,809
This is a guy in a Burger King costume coming to kill everyone in this house.

921
01:06:35,809 --> 01:06:38,199
You know what I mean?

922
01:06:38,199 --> 01:06:39,199
Like it's just a costume.

923
01:06:39,199 --> 01:06:59,860
How long is this intro?

924
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:08,860
Sneak King.

925
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:16,219
This is on FMV, right?

926
01:07:16,219 --> 01:07:18,219
Display view cones.

927
01:07:18,219 --> 01:07:20,219
Play in the sneaking suit.

928
01:07:20,219 --> 01:07:23,300
Okay.

929
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:24,300
How to play.

930
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:25,860
Move.

931
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:26,860
This is first person mode.

932
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:27,860
Move camera.

933
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:28,860
Change zoom.

934
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:29,860
Surprise.

935
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:31,300
Flourish.

936
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:33,789
Hide and cancel and run.

937
01:07:33,789 --> 01:07:36,739
Wait, this is 12 pages?

938
01:07:36,739 --> 01:07:39,739
Use the stick to make the King sneak around.

939
01:07:39,739 --> 01:07:40,739
Move the camera with R.

940
01:07:40,739 --> 01:07:42,909
If controller settings have been switched.

941
01:07:42,909 --> 01:07:44,150
Yeah, whatever.

942
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:46,150
In a challenge, hold the right trigger to run.

943
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:47,150
Just go.

944
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:48,150
Yeah, who cares?

945
01:07:48,150 --> 01:07:54,530
Each time you deliver food, your chain count goes up.

946
01:07:54,530 --> 01:07:56,530
This multiplies any score you earn.

947
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:58,530
If anyone spots you, you'll lose it all.

948
01:07:58,530 --> 01:08:01,530
This will be extra sneaky when your chain count gets high.

949
01:08:01,530 --> 01:08:05,619
Burger gear solid.

950
01:08:05,619 --> 01:08:08,829
Burger.

951
01:08:08,829 --> 01:08:10,010
Burger.

952
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:11,010
Burger.

953
01:08:11,010 --> 01:08:12,440
Hey, then!

954
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:16,279
Thanks for the 10 community subs, yeah?

955
01:08:16,279 --> 01:08:22,550
Missions zero and a 20.

956
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:24,550
Do I have to deliver food to people?

957
01:08:24,550 --> 01:08:30,140
Sawmill challenge.

958
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:34,449
It's morning and you've got enormous omelet sandwiches to give away.

959
01:08:34,449 --> 01:08:37,449
Make three deliveries to the hungry folks in the sawmill.

960
01:08:37,449 --> 01:08:39,449
Consider this breakfast mission accomplished.

961
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:42,449
Press the A button to deliver food, but try not to be seen.

962
01:08:42,449 --> 01:08:58,659
How am I supposed to deliver food to people if I can't be seen?

963
01:08:58,659 --> 01:08:59,659
I can't deliver food.

964
01:09:01,289 --> 01:09:04,289
I'm like fucking Fortnite taunting this guy.

965
01:09:04,289 --> 01:09:06,289
How do I deliver food to him?

966
01:09:06,289 --> 01:09:07,289
Delivery zero.

967
01:09:07,289 --> 01:09:13,369
How do I deliver food?

968
01:09:13,369 --> 01:09:28,880
Where's the gun?

969
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:34,770
How do I deliver food to people?

970
01:09:34,770 --> 01:09:39,439
Oh, that person wants a hamburger.

971
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:44,779
Okay, that person.

972
01:09:44,779 --> 01:09:45,779
Just give them food.

973
01:09:45,779 --> 01:09:53,649
Why do I have to do this?

974
01:09:53,649 --> 01:09:55,649
If people ordered food, why wouldn't they just want it?

975
01:09:55,649 --> 01:10:06,909
Was this game free?

976
01:10:06,909 --> 01:10:13,890
All right, so sneak up behind everybody.

977
01:10:13,890 --> 01:10:19,060
And then surprise them with a delicious six-out-of-ten whopper,

978
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:20,060
because that's what it is.

979
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:33,079
Sawmill.

980
01:10:33,079 --> 01:10:35,079
Oh, wait, I can interact with this.

981
01:10:39,430 --> 01:10:41,430
His head just gets fucking sliced off.

982
01:10:41,430 --> 01:10:44,609
I just jumped into the sawmill.

983
01:10:44,609 --> 01:10:49,750
Wait.

984
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:51,750
Come on, somebody come over here.

985
01:10:51,750 --> 01:11:02,609
You don't feed everybody, only the ones who want burgers.

986
01:11:02,609 --> 01:11:15,279
Oh, are they just people on the minimap?

987
01:11:15,279 --> 01:11:18,989
I don't know why I just asked if it was fall damage.

988
01:11:18,989 --> 01:11:19,989
I was about to say, is there fall damage?

989
01:11:19,989 --> 01:11:21,989
This person wants a burger, right?

990
01:11:21,989 --> 01:11:31,260
Oh, somebody wants one over here.

991
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:32,260
I see it on the minimap.

992
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:35,779
I have to find the person that wants one on the minimap

993
01:11:35,779 --> 01:11:52,140
and then go sneak to them.

994
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:53,140
That guy doesn't want it anymore.

995
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:54,140
God damn it.

996
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:55,140
All right, I get it.

997
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:56,140
I get it.

998
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:58,140
Everyone told me to skip the tutorial.

999
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:09,869
Flourish.

1000
01:12:09,869 --> 01:12:16,720
Okay, is that one?

1001
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:18,720
I want to, like, hide in the saw machine and scare somebody.

1002
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:21,720
Why would you scare, like, a sawmill employee?

1003
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:26,109
That seems like the dumbest thing you could possibly do.

1004
01:12:26,109 --> 01:12:34,840
New missions have been unlocked.

1005
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:35,840
Okay, well, I get it.

1006
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:42,140
Let's see.

1007
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:43,140
Doesn't matter.

1008
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:44,140
All right, let's keep going.

1009
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:46,659
Now what?

1010
01:12:46,659 --> 01:12:50,539
Wait, did I not get a good enough score?

1011
01:12:50,539 --> 01:12:53,710
This morning you got into rank C.

1012
01:12:53,710 --> 01:12:54,710
No, decline.

1013
01:12:54,710 --> 01:13:00,279
Handing over hash browns is enough.

1014
01:13:00,279 --> 01:13:01,279
You've got style.

1015
01:13:01,279 --> 01:13:02,279
Why not use it to deliver a serving of hash browns

1016
01:13:02,279 --> 01:13:03,279
with the flourish?

1017
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:05,609
Okay.

1018
01:13:05,609 --> 01:13:17,979
I did it.

1019
01:13:17,979 --> 01:13:27,310
Wait, is this one map?

1020
01:13:27,310 --> 01:13:28,310
Is it just one map?

1021
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:33,409
This game had to, this game came free

1022
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:36,350
in Burger King Happy Meals or whatever they were.

1023
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:40,359
A true Sneaking would never keep the buttery goodness

1024
01:13:40,359 --> 01:13:43,359
of those croissant witches to himself.

1025
01:13:43,359 --> 01:13:45,359
He delivered these to three hungry citizens

1026
01:13:45,359 --> 01:13:49,500
as fast as possible, and he'd do it in style

1027
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:51,500
without touching any blue vision zones.

1028
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:59,789
I thought there were arrows coming out of his, like, crotch,

1029
01:13:59,789 --> 01:14:01,789
like somebody shot him twice with arrows.

1030
01:14:01,789 --> 01:14:03,789
I was like, who fucking gutted this guy with arrows?

1031
01:14:03,789 --> 01:14:10,260
All right, who's hungry?

1032
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:13,159
This game was four bucks.

1033
01:14:13,159 --> 01:14:14,159
Did they, where did they sell it?

1034
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:16,159
Did they sell it at Burger King?

1035
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:19,739
How could you, where did you buy this game?

1036
01:14:19,739 --> 01:14:24,859
Oh, look at me.

1037
01:14:24,859 --> 01:14:27,899
You did?

1038
01:14:27,899 --> 01:14:33,869
I can't get spotted.

1039
01:14:33,869 --> 01:14:38,220
Somebody's hungry over here.

1040
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:44,899
Is that guy still hungry?

1041
01:14:44,899 --> 01:14:47,100
That person's hungry.

1042
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:53,699
What happened?

1043
01:14:53,699 --> 01:15:02,229
Oh shit, they're coming this way.

1044
01:15:02,229 --> 01:15:03,729
I need to, I need to dump a body in here.

1045
01:15:03,729 --> 01:15:05,729
Wait, won't they just see me?

1046
01:15:05,729 --> 01:15:09,890
Wouldn't you just see this person?

1047
01:15:09,890 --> 01:15:19,699
Everyone's so hungry.

1048
01:15:19,699 --> 01:15:21,699
I'm not doing my job.

1049
01:15:21,699 --> 01:15:34,489
Over here, come on.

1050
01:15:34,489 --> 01:15:36,750
Watch out.

1051
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:37,750
Get away, go away, go away.

1052
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:38,750
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

1053
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:40,750
come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here,

1054
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:50,029
come here, come here, come here come, come here, come here, come on

1055
01:15:50,029 --> 01:15:51,029
Please play the next game.

1056
01:15:51,029 --> 01:15:53,100
The next game is going to,

1057
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:58,739
It's gonna I'm gonna half I'm gonna tell you guys the next game is gonna be very very hard to get me away from

1058
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:01,810
The next game is gonna be impossible for us to move on

1059
01:16:02,149 --> 01:16:06,000
I'm actually probably gonna play it last cuz I'm terrified that I'm gonna stay there forever

1060
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:23,100
And I get this person this person coming around the side here. Is there a time limit? I think there is no not too human

1061
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:25,100
But holy shit, I should get it

1062
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:37,279
Right here. Oh fuck. Oh

1063
01:16:38,319 --> 01:16:39,340
fuck

1064
01:16:39,340 --> 01:17:09,560
New missions have been unlocked. I told me this is bad too human is free since they can't legally sell it anymore

1065
01:17:10,319 --> 01:17:11,739
What?

1066
01:17:11,739 --> 01:17:29,520
They can't legally sell it free flourishes without being seen kind of curious if there's anything else in this game. Let's do this fast

1067
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:42,930
The unreal engine lawsuit thing only they don't nobody sells it. Anyways, you'd be buying it secondhand no matter what you did

1068
01:17:42,930 --> 01:18:00,500
I got to cut this tree down. It's gonna kill that would hurt somebody you're gonna hurt someone

1069
01:18:00,939 --> 01:18:08,220
The person this person passed out from like being hungry

1070
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:13,039
Walked on their body

1071
01:18:22,699 --> 01:18:24,699
People just dropping like flies

1072
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:54,630
Not good enough. Why wait till everyone passes out? I just beat it

1073
01:18:54,630 --> 01:19:00,760
Oh was that when that one quote was not a quote wouldn't be quote, but that was quote not good enough

1074
01:19:01,420 --> 01:19:16,560
Sneak king. I think there's more than one location. I switched the goblin commander or are we are we done with this?

1075
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:29,149
What do you think? That's what's next? I'm breaking the rule here

1076
01:19:29,149 --> 01:19:31,149
This has not been 30 minutes. It's been 20

1077
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:46,699
deliver double the jolts by not only surprising some lucky sawmill worker with a stimulating cup of BK Joe coffee

1078
01:19:47,159 --> 01:19:49,720
But doing it from within a hiding place. Oh

1079
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:53,470
Wow, next game, please. No, I

1080
01:19:54,149 --> 01:19:56,149
Got to deliver some BK Joe

1081
01:19:56,550 --> 01:20:11,430
Get away from me. His head is so big

1082
01:20:11,949 --> 01:20:23,859
Alright, here comes somebody I interest you in a cup of BK Joe. Just sit here until somebody's there. This game sucks next game

1083
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:29,960
Just so wait a minute. I need to scare somebody into drinking coffee

1084
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:39,130
This person's coming who human is a hundred percent free on Xbox live. Is it really I?

1085
01:20:41,159 --> 01:20:46,319
Maybe I should get it. Would you guys want to watch to human you you will for maybe like an hour?

1086
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:56,329
All right. This is not a good place to be

1087
01:20:59,689 --> 01:21:01,210
Sneak King

1088
01:21:01,210 --> 01:21:13,420
Should I hide in the outhouse? I want to see other games. Yeah, I know me too

1089
01:21:13,420 --> 01:21:17,170
I feel like we're gonna play Goblin Commander for a while

1090
01:21:17,729 --> 01:21:24,000
Let's get this out of our system. So nobody tells me Ben begs me to go back to play Sneak King

1091
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:39,279
Have this guy right here. No, they're gonna pass out before I get a chance. Come on. This is stupid a

1092
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:50,100
Sneak King

1093
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:56,510
Dropping like flies. Yeah, are you supposed to hide and do this if this happens?

1094
01:21:57,149 --> 01:22:06,399
Goblin come Goblin commander is an RTS. What it does not look like an RTS. It looks like a

1095
01:22:07,119 --> 01:22:16,670
Game you have a bunch of goblins go do things for you. No one's even come over here

1096
01:22:16,710 --> 01:22:17,829
This is stupid

1097
01:22:17,829 --> 01:22:24,939
Yes, this is Sneak King

1098
01:22:24,939 --> 01:22:32,680
Everybody remembers this very fondly for being hilarious and crazy and zany and comedy and memes

1099
01:22:33,319 --> 01:22:35,100
As you see

1100
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:37,600
This is what this is it. This is it

1101
01:22:38,039 --> 01:22:42,810
It's not like that funny. It's not that like crazy and rare. It's just stupid

1102
01:22:43,409 --> 01:22:48,600
So all the people that you've heard talk about like, oh my god

1103
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:51,199
Oh my god, what type of Burger King did this thing? Oh my god

1104
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:56,000
Listen where they made an Xbox game where you snuck around as a king and gave him like frappuccinos and stuff

1105
01:22:56,039 --> 01:23:01,340
It was so ridiculous. It was the funniest ad campaign ever. Oh, this was dumb. This game sucks

1106
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:07,149
Like this is what it was. This is what they were. This is what they were talking about

1107
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:20,869
Wait, who said that?

1108
01:23:20,909 --> 01:23:21,949
I don't know

1109
01:23:21,949 --> 01:23:25,909
We're making up a straw man to knock it down and can make what and be you know

1110
01:23:25,909 --> 01:23:30,310
Annoyed at a person that might not even exist. Welcome to the world. Welcome to 2021

1111
01:23:30,829 --> 01:23:45,699
I'm very angry at a theoretical person

1112
01:23:46,340 --> 01:24:00,399
This person could exist. I don't know. Maybe I like the previous game

1113
01:24:00,479 --> 01:24:04,800
I need to just do this, but if I don't beat the first level then I'll never hear the end of it

1114
01:24:05,319 --> 01:24:16,239
You're turning into Andy. No, no, you're turning into goofy. What did I come with me? Goofy? What do you mean?

1115
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:25,329
Takes an hour to beat the first level

1116
01:24:25,970 --> 01:24:37,039
No, what? Okay. Well, this is the only time I'm ever gonna play this. I didn't get it when Burger King put it out

1117
01:24:37,039 --> 01:24:39,039
I didn't play it now. I

1118
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:44,920
Don't want to miss out on the fun. I don't want to have to remember

1119
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:50,640
This game ever again. I don't want to slow down. Don't do it. Don't get into that

1120
01:24:51,159 --> 01:25:02,840
How am I supposed to do this? Where can I hide till I get somebody? No, there's only one person that walks in the path of a

1121
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:05,079
What about over here?

1122
01:25:05,079 --> 01:25:14,420
Finish this game for 200 million off the debt. That's not worth it to me because sure

1123
01:25:14,420 --> 01:25:17,460
I could finish the game and get 200 million off the debt, but

1124
01:25:18,979 --> 01:25:24,300
You will that this is gonna get nominated for worst stream if I play sneaking for like another four hours

1125
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:37,000
This will be nominated for worst stream of the year. So like what am I gonna do? That's not enough. There we go. It already is

1126
01:25:39,020 --> 01:25:40,350
Oh

1127
01:25:40,350 --> 01:25:43,390
We say funny things we think we say things that are funny, don't we?

1128
01:25:44,029 --> 01:26:05,899
Look at how funny the funny things we say are right. We do a little trolling here

1129
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:11,380
Just me the streamer and my like army of trolls

1130
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:19,359
Seething. All right. I'm done. I don't want to play this anymore. This game's not good

1131
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:24,800
Hey, you're just a man. All right, we're gonna make up a bunch of people in a room

1132
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:27,319
We're gonna make them up because that's what we're doing right now

1133
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:31,119
See like I just see like five or six people sitting around on a couch

1134
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:39,840
They all have big large Burger King drinks like big like super size like 40 ounce drinks fountain drinks

1135
01:26:40,479 --> 01:26:43,520
And this is like they've already eaten the Burger King food

1136
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:47,050
they're just laughing hysterically and like

1137
01:26:47,289 --> 01:26:53,229
This crack is like six or seven people on this couch and every time you jump out and do like the dance you hear like

1138
01:26:56,689 --> 01:26:58,689
And then like

1139
01:26:59,050 --> 01:27:04,810
They're all at the end of their drinks because they've drank almost a large fucking coke all of them and they all think it's so funny

1140
01:27:04,810 --> 01:27:11,880
I just keep seeing them laughing at this and it's making me angry

1141
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:17,720
At a bridge

1142
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:31,659
Here's your chance to elevate your sneaking to an art form worthy of that of robe and crown

1143
01:27:31,859 --> 01:27:37,060
Live for five of these enormous omelette sandwiches without being seen or hurt really pushing the omelette sandwich

1144
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:40,909
Which may be the grossest thing on the whole menu? So

1145
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:46,039
They that omelette sandwich omelette sandwich omelette sandwich. It's terrible

1146
01:27:46,039 --> 01:27:47,199
It's the worst thing on the menu

1147
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:55,270
They must have had a stockpile of like 600 million of these that they had to really get rid of these were terrible

1148
01:27:55,689 --> 01:28:00,880
What was the what was I don't even know what the thing was?

1149
01:28:01,399 --> 01:28:06,489
This would be a good game if it was an RPG. Oh

1150
01:28:07,010 --> 01:28:16,210
I'm a headache. I don't know the Kings got like a big migraines like not based anti-corporation streamer

1151
01:28:22,569 --> 01:28:33,579
Anti-corporation yeah, you guys can trust me. You guys can trust me. I'm an anti-corporation streamer. Trust me

1152
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:36,560
How does it make see me what?

1153
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:56,270
based corporate pill

1154
01:28:56,909 --> 01:29:05,369
How does that even mean trying to figure out that means? All right, I need to do this. I'm stuck in this stupid game

1155
01:29:06,170 --> 01:29:13,710
Everybody laughs. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. All right. It's time to make everybody that comes to the channel

1156
01:29:13,710 --> 01:29:22,760
That's new. I think this is like the worst like fucking cringe community ever. Okay, we have you have to play along

1157
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:26,119
We have to make it so any time I do the king dance

1158
01:29:26,119 --> 01:29:29,560
We all laugh really hard and we didn't like just do you don't have to laugh that hard

1159
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:31,960
Don't give don't make it that obvious

1160
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:37,420
Just do omega lows make sure it's like all omega lows and then we'll go back to normal, right?

1161
01:29:37,739 --> 01:29:40,600
Like we have to be like, oh my god, I love that dance

1162
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:42,600
We don't do it like five or six times in a row

1163
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:52,359
Okay, we have to make people think that we think this is really funny then they never come back. Are you ready?

1164
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:55,159
Don't do it now. You'd fucking it up stuff

1165
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:58,510
No, you do it reusing the joke

1166
01:29:59,029 --> 01:30:04,869
It's not reusing a joke. It's I love this routine. Okay, I'm gonna do this routine whenever I'm able to I

1167
01:30:06,479 --> 01:30:12,000
Love the like get ten people to think that this whole community is fucking crazy

1168
01:30:14,479 --> 01:30:18,199
Stop doing it. You're doing it wrong. Just wait. Come on. You guys are way better than this

1169
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:25,680
Just wait. Yeah, like just wait

1170
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:33,479
We already are it no, but like they don't they don't know that right away

1171
01:30:33,479 --> 01:30:38,239
It takes about a year being here in this community before you figure out. Holy shit. We're all like nuts. I

1172
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:43,369
Don't want them to have to wait that long

1173
01:30:43,729 --> 01:30:51,000
Is this like links house? Where am I?

1174
01:30:55,090 --> 01:30:58,050
Imagine if I just grab this guy by the shirt and pull him off like hitman

1175
01:30:58,890 --> 01:31:07,710
Stop no, it don't I I'm you have to wait till I get into character. I'm not in character yet. You're blowing it

1176
01:31:08,229 --> 01:31:10,600
It's only when I do the dance and then that's it

1177
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:18,079
Just wait till I do the day it's when I do the the arm up dance

1178
01:31:18,079 --> 01:31:23,840
Everyone has to do it and then stop let's kick this lady. I here we go. Go go go go go go go go go go one

1179
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:25,119
two three, oh

1180
01:31:25,119 --> 01:31:28,810
my god

1181
01:31:28,810 --> 01:31:34,109
Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. I

1182
01:31:34,510 --> 01:31:36,829
Completely forgot about this game. Oh no

1183
01:31:37,029 --> 01:31:39,619
Oh

1184
01:31:39,619 --> 01:31:40,739
crap

1185
01:31:40,739 --> 01:31:46,850
Got me and my buddies would sit on the couch right when this came out. It was so much fun

1186
01:31:46,850 --> 01:31:50,239
I remember we would just sit on the couch. It was like five or six of us

1187
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:52,920
But we would just laugh at this shit. The king is so funny

1188
01:31:54,569 --> 01:31:56,569
It's so funny

1189
01:31:56,770 --> 01:32:05,000
What should I do? Should I hide like in the leaves? I wonder if I can I get somebody like this? What the heck was that? Oh

1190
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:16,659
Somebody's coming somebody's coming. So he's coming. It's so funny. What happened to that guy?

1191
01:32:20,939 --> 01:32:24,340
Like I get like you're seriously barely could say that I know it's coming too

1192
01:32:24,979 --> 01:32:31,710
This is so classic. I love it. This is like classic 90s comedy

1193
01:32:32,210 --> 01:32:35,600
Okay, here we go. It's gonna happen again

1194
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:51,979
Look at that stupid dance. I love those two. That's like my favorite item. This is the omelet. Here comes a two in a row

1195
01:33:00,739 --> 01:33:04,819
That's two in a row but that seriously is like probably my favorite sandwich

1196
01:33:05,180 --> 01:33:13,520
I wish I would bring that back bring back the omelet sandwich. Everybody loved it. It's been at least me and my friends did

1197
01:33:14,279 --> 01:33:19,159
We would order it me like me and like four or five us we'd go to the drive-thru and it'd be like hey

1198
01:33:19,359 --> 01:33:22,000
Bros, what are we getting and at the same time?

1199
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:27,500
We would all kind of side eye each other and then after like three or four seconds, we'd go omelet sandwich and we'd pull in

1200
01:33:28,319 --> 01:33:36,680
So funny, I love it. I'm gonna go this way. Oh

1201
01:33:41,399 --> 01:33:44,720
Nothing nothing beat that. Is everybody alright? Hopefully everyone gets up soon

1202
01:33:45,239 --> 01:33:53,489
Those are the days I did really was back in like the mid 90s like late 90s mid 90s

1203
01:33:53,489 --> 01:33:57,050
I wanted like the drive-thru with like your buddies and stuff. I

1204
01:33:58,930 --> 01:34:02,069
Missed that like yeah, you can't do that shit anymore. I mean

1205
01:34:02,649 --> 01:34:10,189
Like only only in like 1998 did you could you go to like a drive-thru like a Burger King drive-thru McDonald's drive-thru?

1206
01:34:10,189 --> 01:34:12,569
You can't like did nobody just keep you don't do that

1207
01:34:13,270 --> 01:34:15,270
They only did that back in like the 90s

1208
01:34:15,789 --> 01:34:19,500
How much better the toys were too?

1209
01:34:19,539 --> 01:34:24,399
It was so much better than they are now

1210
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:36,109
We would trade I remember when I was younger. This is probably I don't know maybe like three or four years ago

1211
01:34:36,789 --> 01:34:39,869
Friends of ours that we would get the Happy Meals and stuff and we would look at each other

1212
01:34:39,869 --> 01:34:44,590
We'd side eye each other and be like who's trading who and sometimes we would get the same things

1213
01:34:44,590 --> 01:34:49,920
Like let's say it was like a Hot Wheels thing two of us three of us would get the same car

1214
01:34:50,439 --> 01:34:54,920
It'd be like oh shit RNG. We would all start laughing

1215
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:58,420
Oh

1216
01:35:03,199 --> 01:35:04,960
It's so funny I

1217
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:10,060
Should I should dress up as the king in my next dream and do that dance?

1218
01:35:10,619 --> 01:35:15,770
And like present you guys like a sandwich. I don't have to do two more. Oh

1219
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:21,500
So hungry got it. Can I get two in a row?

1220
01:35:22,380 --> 01:35:32,430
That's my favorite part right there. He does like the knees

1221
01:35:33,050 --> 01:35:37,720
I'm sad that we're not gonna be able to see it again

1222
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:41,439
After this mission and I get this guy. Oh

1223
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:43,159
Oh

1224
01:35:43,159 --> 01:36:01,930
Crap I run. Oh, I just missed it. This game is hilarious

1225
01:36:01,930 --> 01:36:06,060
I know and people forgot about it people forgot this existed

1226
01:36:06,539 --> 01:36:09,760
I'm the only one that remembers me and my friends on the couch

1227
01:36:10,199 --> 01:36:15,560
This is the only people that know this exists. No one else does only us only my four friends

1228
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:34,800
Sitting on the couch with our large cokes. I did it. I can't do it anymore. It's too much for me

1229
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:44,180
Stop I have to stop stop doing this that was going on for a while too

1230
01:36:44,180 --> 01:36:50,430
And I wonder how many people came and left. Thank God one more mission. I have to do seven

1231
01:36:51,350 --> 01:37:01,600
Lucky seven. I want to see them another map

1232
01:37:02,949 --> 01:37:07,520
Game. Oh my god. What a classic. That was so convincing

1233
01:37:08,119 --> 01:37:25,119
No, it wasn't at all. Actually, it was just it was so unconvincing that maybe it was convincing game books

1234
01:37:26,279 --> 01:37:29,189
HD it was concerning

1235
01:37:29,510 --> 01:37:40,560
All right. Hold on sometimes surprise and sneak ability on enough at those times

1236
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:44,880
You need to pick up your robe and turn on the speed deliver croissant which breakfast sandwiches to three people

1237
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:46,800
Why what's in the breakfast sandwiches?

1238
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:57,489
30 seconds. I don't think I can do that. I was acting straight up from the room. It's pretty good acting in that actually

1239
01:38:05,699 --> 01:38:17,670
Oh shit, I got it. Oh mega love got it

1240
01:38:18,670 --> 01:38:25,770
Oh

1241
01:38:26,130 --> 01:38:34,310
It's like an angry cat

1242
01:38:36,670 --> 01:38:41,069
Now that was a real like that was a real joke that you would have heard

1243
01:38:41,829 --> 01:38:49,640
During that routine two minutes ago. I'm stuck in that routine. I think

1244
01:39:02,819 --> 01:39:06,180
Waiting to see I'm waiting to look over and see everybody laughing

1245
01:39:06,739 --> 01:39:17,210
What the fuck this game sucks moving on wait, I want to do it one more time. I can get it

1246
01:39:17,210 --> 01:39:19,210
I just want to see the laughing

1247
01:39:19,529 --> 01:39:36,760
Omega little not laughing aren't psychopaths usually good at acting you just said I was bad at acting therefore

1248
01:39:36,760 --> 01:39:56,979
I'm not a psychopath. Is that what you're talking about? There's no I frames there

1249
01:39:56,979 --> 01:40:12,989
So if you get stuck there when you get out somebody's next to you, you're gonna get caught. I got it. All right, I'm done

1250
01:40:12,989 --> 01:40:29,390
I have to get out of here. Why is the king so huge? That's enough. Yeah, that's enough

1251
01:40:30,170 --> 01:40:37,029
Let's go to Goblin commander. I have high hopes or Goblin commander. That's why I'm waited this long to play it

1252
01:40:37,390 --> 01:40:39,880
I have high hopes for the next game as well

1253
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:45,399
That's why I'm waiting to play that one last because I feel like if I play that one right now like I'll get stuck playing it

1254
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:54,899
Guaranteed so you think sneak King will be?

1255
01:40:55,500 --> 01:41:02,489
Well, okay. So do you guys think burger King will still be a company in 50 years or a hundred years?

1256
01:41:02,489 --> 01:41:13,020
I think about that sometimes if you think about like the games that not the games that the companies in the places now

1257
01:41:13,619 --> 01:41:17,979
They're probably not gonna exist in a hundred plus years. I don't think so

1258
01:41:20,189 --> 01:41:31,630
Doesn't three. Oh my god, it'll be the only thing left to eat

1259
01:41:38,939 --> 01:41:40,460
Goblin commander

1260
01:41:40,460 --> 01:41:44,569
Why does this look like when you get an iPhone game on your iPad?

1261
01:41:45,090 --> 01:41:50,460
They have to press the 2x button on the bottom right and that's how you automatically know to uninstall it

1262
01:41:50,979 --> 01:42:02,989
Actually looks pretty sick. I make this look any better

1263
01:42:04,189 --> 01:42:05,510
2003

1264
01:42:05,510 --> 01:42:10,680
Is it an RTS? It looks good though. It's kind of bright

1265
01:42:15,699 --> 01:42:18,659
campaign

1266
01:42:18,659 --> 01:42:28,439
Humans won't be around in a hundred years a campaign

1267
01:42:30,600 --> 01:42:32,520
Do I have to make a name?

1268
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:46,300
About her mom the three letters. It's more than three letters. Okay, there we go. Don't matter. Whatever

1269
01:42:46,979 --> 01:42:59,680
Only beasts will be left. I don't know what the hell is gonna be left. Probably just bugs and insects

1270
01:43:04,350 --> 01:43:08,199
It's gonna be insects and alligators

1271
01:43:16,069 --> 01:43:22,819
Was not so much born as we were created

1272
01:43:23,579 --> 01:43:27,420
Wrought through the power on stone by the human

1273
01:43:29,979 --> 01:43:34,500
Granted purpose granted life and made whole

1274
01:43:35,140 --> 01:43:38,899
Gonna come on this one. You can stop the cringe routine

1275
01:43:40,739 --> 01:43:48,340
Said anything a great machine that would grant us beyond our wildest dreams

1276
01:43:49,100 --> 01:43:51,340
I'm gonna verse the alligator which one wins

1277
01:43:55,579 --> 01:43:57,579
Alligator

1278
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:19,300
What are the animals that lasted the million years from like the Jurassic period that's what's gonna still be around

1279
01:44:23,619 --> 01:44:25,619
horseshoe crabs crocodiles

1280
01:44:26,340 --> 01:44:32,529
Bugs like insects

1281
01:44:38,199 --> 01:44:41,460
Here we go

1282
01:44:42,220 --> 01:44:44,460
Time to create my I'm the bad guy in this game, right?

1283
01:44:45,020 --> 01:44:47,390
Take goblins and I try to go over the world

1284
01:44:47,550 --> 01:44:52,949
Higgins, I don't think chickens gonna last

1285
01:45:02,590 --> 01:45:04,869
Back into it there's plenty of work to be done

1286
01:45:05,470 --> 01:45:10,850
You hear a boss man say put your back into it

1287
01:45:11,409 --> 01:45:24,899
What happened to me the goblin commander this glowing blue character is the spirit form of grumble your goblin commander

1294
01:45:59,659 --> 01:46:04,300
Your first mission objective is to move the commander over to the help pad at the south end of the room

1295
01:46:04,859 --> 01:46:08,960

01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:36,939
Grind the vermin into pulp. There's a waypoint flag near them using the appropriate clan button. Okay, let's go

1343
01:51:42,739 --> 01:51:48,670
As long as it's breakable

1344
01:51:48,670 --> 01:51:50,000
and

1345
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:50,880

Assuming to wait. I want to release how do I release out of this guy? Is it got to die?

1347
01:51:56,739 --> 01:52:05,170
I don't want to be the different. I want to be the guy with the whip. This is cool. I like this

1348
01:52:05,810 --> 01:52:16,210

This game rare I think this is a rare game

1351
01:52:42,829 --> 01:52:44,829
I love playing rare games for you guys

1352
01:52:46,270 --> 01:52:49,869
As you can see like what it was like playing games that weren't rare when I was your age

1353
01:52:50,590 --> 01:52:59,100
Contact sensitive tool tips related to objects and characters nearby on the controller made to appear in the upper right center of the screen

1354
01:53:00,159 --> 01:53:02,319
Yeah, I say so it's like it's like legends of zelda

1355
01:53:12,510 --> 01:53:15,630
It might not even be like legend of zelda. That's just ocarina of times the only game I played

1356
01:53:16,029 --> 01:53:21,060
Why are you reading the tips?

1357
01:53:21,060 --> 01:53:24,770
Because if I don't i'm gonna miss something. I mean, it's gonna be horrible

1358
01:53:25,409 --> 01:53:28,270
I have 176 bucks

Okay, we're gonna go get him

1361
01:53:37,300 --> 01:53:39,899
Might even put him back to work

1362
01:53:39,899 --> 01:53:48,159
I feel like i'm watching

1363
01:53:48,399 --> 01:53:49,600
a stream

1364
01:53:49,600 --> 01:53:54,960
Of somebody streaming a game back in like 2010. I don't feel like i'm playing this game

1365
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:57,439
I feel like i'm watching the stream of this game

1366
01:54:02,689 --> 01:54:04,880
It's huge

1367
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:05,920
all right

1368
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:07,920
Prediction is this guy human or not?

1369
01:54:09,229 --> 01:54:14,590
Titans are powerful monstrosities that through direct control can be used to inflict heavy damage

1370
01:54:15,069 --> 01:54:21,149
To take direct control of a titan position the commander over it and press the y button Aaron

1371
01:54:22,739 --> 01:54:28,529
While in direct control use the various buttons in order your titan to attack to adjust the camera

1372
01:54:29,010 --> 01:54:31,409
Aaron Aaron use the right thumbstick

1373
01:54:34,979 --> 01:54:47,229
Looks like he's an injured need to feed him so he can heal himself. Holy shit

1374
01:54:47,310 --> 01:54:53,060
What did I just do health halo located around the unit's base?

1375
01:54:53,789 --> 01:54:57,949
Health halos represent the unit's current state when the halo is green

1376
01:54:58,430 --> 01:55:03,310
The unit is in good health when it's yellow. The unit is in fair health and when it is red

1377
01:55:03,949 --> 01:55:08,109
The unit is in poor health and will likely die if it takes any more damage

1378
01:55:08,350 --> 01:55:15,899
I need to get health I get to be this huge guy. This is perfect eat

1379
01:55:20,659 --> 01:55:22,659
well

1380
01:55:22,739 --> 01:55:24,739
That was funny when you killed me

1381
01:55:24,739 --> 01:55:35,619
How do I open how do I get out of here use the stone or go to eat all the critters in the room?

1382
01:55:45,470 --> 01:55:48,909
This is I love this part

1383
01:55:48,909 --> 01:55:50,670
It's like my favorite part

1384
01:55:50,670 --> 01:55:54,850
What if I eat the commander hold on can I eat the commander?

1385
01:55:55,409 --> 01:56:16,140
Oh shit. I'm the commander now. Why why am I yellow open the door to eat all of them?

1386
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:21,600
Am I poisoning everybody? What am I doing? How am I my?

1387
01:56:26,449 --> 01:56:28,609
I had to eat all of them not just get to green

1388
01:56:30,590 --> 01:56:35,390
The debris is from that cave in should have been cleaned up hours ago time to get to work

1389
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:41,760
All those all that money

1390
01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:45,970
All right, let's clear this out

1391
01:56:45,970 --> 01:56:47,970
Well, I love this this guy. Okay

1392
01:56:48,369 --> 01:56:53,260
This game when I first got in and I was looking at what the game was like

1393
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:55,180
Oh, you have to like walk around

1394
01:56:55,180 --> 01:56:58,380
It was like a four out of ten for me and I was going to just move on in like 20 minutes

1395
01:56:59,260 --> 01:57:06,850
Now this changes everything. I'm just standing around and gawking get in there and help

1396
01:57:09,069 --> 01:57:16,029
Following Titans to instruct a clan to follow your Titan pull and hold the left trigger and double tap the clan button

1397
01:57:17,569 --> 01:57:21,489
Pull and hold the left trigger then press the appropriate clan button to place a waypoint flag

1398
01:57:26,779 --> 01:57:31,390

01:57:52,960 --> 01:58:05,500
Didn't I do that already? No, it's debris over here. He had it you double tap to follow. Oh, okay

1402
01:58:06,140 --> 01:58:10,300
I don't I can't step on them and crush them. Can I?

1403
01:58:16,979 --> 01:58:18,979
Really fun place where it reminds me of this really funny game

1404
01:58:19,300 --> 01:58:23,140
Me and my buddies like called sneak kings check it out sometime. I think you'd enjoy it. Were you on the couch?

1405
01:58:23,939 --> 01:58:27,550
Are you on the couch all with lar extra large cokes?

1406
01:58:28,750 --> 01:58:32,239
down to the ice

1407
01:58:32,239 --> 01:58:34,560
If not, then I don't care about what you have to say

1408
01:58:35,039 --> 01:58:43,500
Instruct your units to follow the stone ogre and lead them to the door

1409
01:58:52,159 --> 01:59:01,250
Break rocks. It's a blade worm and it's stirred up more of those filthy critters. We must destroy it. Everyone doesn't care about chat

1410
01:59:03,380 --> 01:59:09,140
No, I don't all right. You got it out of me. It took you six straight fucking years. You finally got it out of me

1411
01:59:09,380 --> 01:59:11,380
I don't like it. I don't like chat

1412
01:59:12,350 --> 01:59:14,670
I've been bottling this up for 10 years. Okay

1413
01:59:15,310 --> 01:59:17,699
ah

1414
01:59:17,699 --> 01:59:21,340

1415
01:59:21,340 --> 01:59:23,260

1416
01:59:23,260 --> 01:59:30,180
I'm trying to keep it together. But oh that person said the burger king thing

1417
01:59:31,710 --> 01:59:35,630
And my teeth were just clenching the whole time. He said it

1418
01:59:36,590 --> 01:59:41,119
Uh

1419
01:59:41,119 --> 01:59:45,500
I won so was collected 44 gold collected 446 two units lost

1420
01:59:46,380 --> 01:59:49,250
This game's fun. I like this

1421
01:59:49,250 --> 01:59:51,420
Everyone sit down clip it clip it

1422
01:59:52,699 --> 01:59:57,470
We're doing our best

1423
01:59:57,470 --> 02:00:01,789
Here comes the here comes the meltdown. Here it is the career ending meltdown

1424
02:00:02,350 --> 02:00:11,500
You say psych you hurt my feelings

1425
02:00:15,819 --> 02:00:23,180
Rise in time time for work on the count of three i'm coming in there one

1426
02:00:25,729 --> 02:00:27,250
Two

1427
02:00:27,250 --> 02:00:32,510
Enter the clan shrine and create five miners

1428
02:00:35,039 --> 02:00:43,569
Oh, this is the stone crusher clan shrine here. You can buy goblins unlock caged goblins and upgrade your units

1429
02:00:44,369 --> 02:00:46,689
To navigate the clan shrine use the left thumbstick

1430
02:00:49,300 --> 02:00:51,300
goblins cost resources

1431
02:00:51,300 --> 02:00:56,659
Which are displayed at the bottom of the screen to buy the highlighted goblin press the a button

1432
02:00:57,220 --> 02:00:59,380
And it'll appear outside the clan shrine

1433
02:00:59,939 --> 02:01:02,020
Moving to the current waypoint for the clan

1434
02:01:03,170 --> 02:01:05,489
No clan can have more than 10 goblins at any time

1435
02:01:06,430 --> 02:01:09,390
Notice the stone crusher icon located at the bottom left of the screen

1436
02:01:09,630 --> 02:01:14,779
This indicates how many goblins are currently in the clan. I gotta retake that retake

1437
02:01:15,340 --> 02:01:20,239
That's bad take to exit the clan shrine plus plus the y button

1438
02:01:20,960 --> 02:01:24,850
All right, we need miners miner. How many do we need?

1439
02:01:27,710 --> 02:01:30,680
All right, five miners goblins

1440
02:01:34,270 --> 02:01:36,270
I want uh, I want rock throwers. Why not?

1441
02:01:42,850 --> 02:01:44,850
Well time is resources

1442
02:01:45,010 --> 02:01:48,369
Now that we slept half a day away, we need to scour the area for golden souls

1443
02:01:55,420 --> 02:01:57,420
I want direct control of this guy

1444
02:02:01,180 --> 02:02:05,020
If it's analog control, then it's not an rts for me. It's more fun to play

1445
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:19,279
Fake gamer. Why do you hate real video games?

1446
02:02:22,140 --> 02:02:25,020
Do I have to answer that question?

1447
02:02:25,020 --> 02:02:28,699
You you want you need do you want me to answer that question? Why do I hate real video games?

1448
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:35,359
I would like you to name me a video game. That's come out in the last year

1449
02:02:36,159 --> 02:02:38,159
That you would like me to play right now

1450
02:02:38,619 --> 02:02:42,460
That all of us can sit here and agree is a game that it should be played

1451
02:02:43,420 --> 02:02:56,350
That should be here. Which one?

1452
02:02:56,430 --> 02:02:57,390
Hades

1453
02:02:57,390 --> 02:02:58,829
I already played hades and it was great

1454
02:02:58,829 --> 02:03:03,229
I played I played street of lake three times and I played a shit load of it off stream and I got like the hardest achievements

1455
02:03:03,229 --> 02:03:10,510
In the game. It was really fun like gold by smashing them where the boulders

1456
02:03:17,760 --> 02:03:19,840
No games aren't good. Only old games are good

1457
02:03:20,399 --> 02:03:25,520
Go back to the shrine and strengthen the equipment

1458
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:32,210
Only old games are fun

1459
02:03:32,210 --> 02:03:39,420
Oh tools and played jack and dexter it came out in 2001

1460
02:03:41,460 --> 02:03:44,979

1461
02:03:47,180 --> 02:03:49,180
I don't know jack and dexter

02:03:49,420 --> 02:03:52,430

1464
02:04:01,550 --> 02:04:03,550
Each clan has a set of three upgrades

1465
02:04:04,850 --> 02:04:08,449
First to apply to all goblins in the clan while the last applies to the clan support unit

1466
02:04:09,329 --> 02:04:13,250
Each of these upgrades can be purchased three times. All right, cool. Let's get it

1467
02:04:13,489 --> 02:04:20,439
I'll say cameras are strong armor

1468

What this is another one too, what's the other one this jack and dexter

Ratchet and clank. Yeah

1473
02:04:52,500 --> 02:05:04,640
They all seem like the same like dream characters to me. All right, find additional any find additional souls. Let's go

There's like a and the in the weasel companion is like a technological like intelligent person and they have like funny lines

1477
02:05:21,220 --> 02:05:22,899
It's like a comedic comic relief

It's like the small small like guy with big like goofy weapon and then comic relief weasel character, right?

1479
02:05:40,640 --> 02:05:42,640
That like jack and dexter

1481
02:05:45,649 --> 02:05:58,829
Uh ratchet and clank who's clank? No, I don't put banjo kazooie in that category because banjo kazooie don't have big uh goofy weapons

1482
02:05:59,149 --> 02:06:08,670
It's a robot. He's the robot. Does he have comedy lines though?

1483
02:06:09,579 --> 02:06:11,819
Does he does he pop up on?

Anything that has an and in the middle of it. I did not care about what are some other ones mac and cheese

1494
02:07:35,279 --> 02:07:37,600
I actually don't really like mac and cheese

1495
02:07:38,159 --> 02:07:39,760
But wait, I don't know

1496
02:07:39,760 --> 02:07:46,000
Mac and cheese is not mac and cheese. It's mac and cheese like this. It's like mac n

1497
02:07:46,779 --> 02:07:52,300
Apostrophe cheese, but I don't really eat it dungeons and dragons don't really like that

1498
02:07:52,380 --> 02:07:58,020
I'm not a big fan of that game simpsons hit and run don't no that doesn't that's that's not accurate

1499
02:07:58,500 --> 02:08:00,500
That's simpsons hit

1500
02:08:00,659 --> 02:08:02,579
And run a hit and run

1501
02:08:02,579 --> 02:08:07,439
Is like a thing happening a hit and run is like it's an action

1502
02:08:07,760 --> 02:08:17,729
It's not like something and something black and white. Yeah. All right, you might got me there

1507
02:08:55,649 --> 02:09:12,210
That game's not fun. I played it because we're we had a timer tim and eric. Oh shit. There you go

1508
02:09:13,420 --> 02:09:20,539

Was tim and eric awesome show great job. It wasn't the show was not called tim and eric. It was tim and eric

1510
02:09:29,250 --> 02:09:36,060
Awesome show great job wallace and grommet. I didn't really watch it. I didn't really care for it

1511
02:09:36,300 --> 02:09:40,060
I thought it was like cool, but I didn't watch it because it was two characters with an and in the middle

1512
02:09:42,560 --> 02:09:47,039
Sex and the city. No. Yeah, didn't watch that fucking show either didn't care about it at all

1513
02:09:47,039 --> 02:09:59,020
I didn't want to watch one episode ren and stimpy and you've got it right there. It was not ren

1514
02:09:59,579 --> 02:10:01,579

02:10:02,119 --> 02:10:10,289
Ampersand stimpy completely different. I would watch that show a thousand times. It's not rick ampersand morty

1516
02:10:10,369 --> 02:10:24,399
It's rick and morty don't want to watch it. That like actually is weird how that's true for me

1517
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:30,590
If it was if it was jack ampersand dexter, I might like care. Why is that weird?

1518
02:10:30,590 --> 02:10:41,659
That's weird. Why do I do that ed ed and eddie?

1519
02:10:41,819 --> 02:10:45,869
I didn't I did not watch that much of that show. I think I watched like two episodes

1520
02:10:46,189 --> 02:10:55,119
All right

1521
02:10:55,119 --> 02:10:57,600
I need to make new people because I lost everybody

1522
02:10:57,760 --> 02:11:06,159
Problems like the rock throw that are not available appear in cages to unlock a cage like the desire goblin using left

1523
02:11:06,159 --> 02:11:16,100
I'm seeing presented to one two, three, four five

1524
02:11:17,579 --> 02:11:24,460
Okay, plenty of miners. Let's go. All right. I got ten units now hate conjunctions and english grammar

1525
02:11:24,699 --> 02:11:46,539
I mean, I it's just a weird thing rocket and ratchet ampersand clank. Don't do the same thing. I just did please

1526
02:11:46,539 --> 02:11:48,539
What are you doing? Please? Don't do that. What am I doing?

1527
02:11:49,180 --> 02:11:58,180
run away

1528
02:11:58,180 --> 02:12:05,329
Alvin and hubs. Oh shit soul fountains provide souls to the clan of its owner

1529
02:12:05,729 --> 02:12:09,729
Capture a soul fountain dispatch all enemies in the immediate area position your clan next to it for a time

1530
02:12:09,970 --> 02:12:12,659
When capture the souls that are released will turn from red to blue

1531
02:12:13,220 --> 02:12:25,710
Okay, so are they gonna get it? They're lying to everyone. I'm really not though character's name and character's name

1532
02:12:26,109 --> 02:12:41,729
It's just it was like a turn off for me all through my life. We get it destroy the blade worms

1533
02:12:41,810 --> 02:12:45,340
How am I gonna do that? I have to actually go kill those things

1534
02:12:49,869 --> 02:12:54,350
Dunk and donuts dunking and don't it's not dunking and donuts. It's dunking donuts

1535
02:12:55,500 --> 02:13:03,729
Like you're dunking your donut in the coffee dunk in donuts not dunk and donuts world and warcraft

1536
02:13:03,890 --> 02:13:14,060
No, that's wrong too bill and ted i've never seen that for i've never seen that movie start to finish ever

1537
02:13:21,090 --> 02:13:23,810
Hall of titans we must enlist a stone ogre to help with our work

1538
02:13:23,970 --> 02:13:32,319
I can have souls to enter the hall of titans and buy a stone

1539
02:13:33,760 --> 02:13:39,439
Ogre, how much do I need all of?

1540
02:13:40,159 --> 02:13:45,579
I have to do it. I'm only gonna do this one more time. I promise

1541
02:13:50,659 --> 02:13:53,250
No, i'm not gonna do it

1542
02:13:53,250 --> 02:13:59,060
Each clan will have one titan and one turret associated with it available in the hall of titans to buy a titan

1543
02:13:59,550 --> 02:14:02,189
Select the desired unit using the left thumb stick

1544
02:14:03,010 --> 02:14:09,489
When doing so the unit stats will be displayed at the bottom right of the screen cool. Yeah, they cost resources

1545
02:14:09,489 --> 02:14:13,810
We all know that all right. I have a ogre

1546
02:14:21,229 --> 02:14:29,380
Attack and titan stewie and brian. It's not the name of his show. That's the name of two characters

1547
02:14:31,899 --> 02:14:40,289
Lord and the rings. Okay, would it be as popular as a series if it was called lord and the rings?

1548
02:14:41,229 --> 02:14:51,920
I don't think so. All right, we're gonna go break this clear the debris and collect 125 gold

1549
02:14:54,340 --> 02:14:58,079
That still dramatically makes sense by the way lord and the rings

1550
02:14:58,479 --> 02:15:11,680
What about what about germa and stir that wasn't the name of our youtube channel?

1551
02:15:13,340 --> 02:15:15,340
We just played a lot of stuff together

1552
02:15:23,729 --> 02:15:25,250
Let's see. That's a lot of money

1553
02:15:25,250 --> 02:15:34,590
light and magic harry potter and the philosopher's stone

1554
02:15:35,069 --> 02:15:37,119
No, i'm sorry

1555
02:15:37,119 --> 02:15:41,600
the name of that the name of that series is not harry potter and ron weasley

1556
02:15:42,619 --> 02:15:43,500
and

1557
02:15:43,500 --> 02:15:47,420
Hermione it's not that it's not harry potter and hermione granger

1558
02:15:48,060 --> 02:16:01,550
You've got it wrong again

1559
02:16:01,550 --> 02:16:05,149
Who cares? All right, stop we gotta move off this. I don't want to read any more hands

1560
02:16:07,149 --> 02:16:11,630
I don't want to read any more of these. I told you my theory and it's that's it

1561
02:16:25,439 --> 02:16:27,039
Camper san andy

1562
02:16:27,039 --> 02:16:30,420
All right. We got to kill what do you what do you mean? What are you doing?

1563
02:16:30,979 --> 02:16:36,100
Return the commander to the hall of titans by three rock

1564
02:16:36,659 --> 02:16:39,219
Lobbers and place them onto the glowing orbs

1565
02:16:39,860 --> 02:16:45,329
I think I already have them

1566
02:16:45,329 --> 02:16:46,799
titan

1567
02:16:46,799 --> 02:16:49,819
titans

1568
02:16:49,819 --> 02:16:52,540
Eren Eren Eren Eren

1569
02:16:53,440 --> 02:16:57,440
Eren Eren Eren Eren Eren

1570
02:16:59,780 --> 02:17:01,219
I already have like five

1571
02:17:01,219 --> 02:17:09,569
I have I already have too many of these

1572
02:17:09,569 --> 02:17:11,489
What do I put them where?

1573
02:17:11,489 --> 02:17:21,409
Buy it. I have to buy a turret

1574
02:17:21,409 --> 02:17:23,409
three rock lobbers

1575
02:17:30,579 --> 02:17:34,260
Oh, this is like blending in with the ground. Okay and place them

1576
02:17:34,819 --> 02:17:49,819
Oh, come on. All right. We're gonna put and place them on the glowing orbs

1577
02:17:50,299 --> 02:17:57,219
Where is there a glowing orb?

1578
02:17:57,219 --> 02:18:00,190
ah

1579
02:18:00,190 --> 02:18:19,069
One finn and jake how many times do I have to say this the name of that show is not finn and jake

1580
02:18:19,549 --> 02:18:35,780
It's adventure time

1581
02:18:35,780 --> 02:18:51,280
Derma and sucks. Yeah star wars would have sucked. Nobody would have gone to the theater if it was called

1582
02:18:51,840 --> 02:18:53,840
luke and darth vader

1583
02:18:54,159 --> 02:18:56,159
You none of you would have seen the movie

1584
02:18:57,860 --> 02:19:17,739
No one would have seen the movie. I'm telling you. I don't think those critters will be showing their thorny hides around here anytime soon

1585
02:19:18,670 --> 02:19:37,170
Great job gay and silent bob never watched it. I've not seen that movie

1586
02:19:45,819 --> 02:19:47,260
What the

1587
02:19:47,260 --> 02:19:48,700
natarse

1588
02:19:48,700 --> 02:19:50,139
great frocks

1589
02:19:50,639 --> 02:19:52,479
It's gonna be another titan

1590
02:19:52,479 --> 02:19:59,549
I hope and then I can do my armin voice at least another three times before I have to retire it forever because everybody hates it

1591
02:20:16,110 --> 02:20:20,379
What's next rescue the three trapped workers, let's go

1592
02:20:22,879 --> 02:20:26,000
This game is actually really fun. I could see what people would play this a lot

1593
02:20:27,100 --> 02:20:31,659
But we're about to be done in like the next I don't know. Yeah, 30 20 minutes 30 minutes. I don't know

1594
02:20:31,659 --> 02:20:33,659
I'm still enjoying it. I think it's cool

1595
02:20:44,459 --> 02:20:46,459
King in the hill it's king of the hill

1596
02:20:47,870 --> 02:20:49,870
Suicide seen many episodes of that show

1597
02:20:53,100 --> 02:20:55,100
Yeah, can I eat the big plant?

1598
02:20:57,549 --> 02:21:06,239
Nice. All right, we got one

1599
02:21:06,239 --> 02:21:10,290
alvin and the chipmunks

1600
02:21:10,290 --> 02:21:12,290
Yes, and that that is one of the most

1601
02:21:13,010 --> 02:21:14,190
awful

1602
02:21:14,190 --> 02:21:21,620
Franchises ever all the new mood like you are you trying to tell me to go see alvin and the chipmunks and you're even that's not

1603
02:21:21,620 --> 02:21:26,370
Even right you have it wrong again. It's not alvin and theodore

1604
02:21:27,090 --> 02:21:30,049
Or alvin and simon it's alvin and the chipmunks

1605
02:21:31,459 --> 02:21:35,059
But that doesn't we didn't have to talk about that because that whole franchise is dog shit

1606
02:21:35,219 --> 02:21:45,620
We don't even need to talk about it that right off the bat. It's just a non watch

1607
02:21:46,180 --> 02:22:01,020
How much off the deck for you to get an alvin and the chipmunks tattoo?

1608
02:22:06,190 --> 02:22:10,989
It would take okay, i'll be honest with you i'm gonna be very honest with you. Let me be honest fine

1609
02:22:11,309 --> 02:22:14,829
Here's how what that would take for me to get an alvin and the chipmunks tattoo

1610
02:22:15,149 --> 02:22:18,909
And we're talking the 3d alvin and the chipmunks, which is way worse

1611
02:22:19,860 --> 02:22:24,260
The like alvin and the chipmunks from like the fucking 40s or whatever it was like the 60s

1612
02:22:24,260 --> 02:22:26,020
I don't even know when they first came out

1613
02:22:26,020 --> 02:22:31,540
That old style. Okay, cool. It's like i'd be like getting snap crackle pop tattooed on you

1614
02:22:31,700 --> 02:22:35,860
It's like, oh, all right. Well, it's kind of weird but like oh, whatever. It's like old. I guess it's like an old thing

1615
02:22:36,340 --> 02:22:38,729
getting the 3d

1616
02:22:38,729 --> 02:22:44,030
Reimagination of those characters tattooed on my body. It would it would cost a million dollars

1617
02:22:44,670 --> 02:22:47,309
I would need one million dollars taxed

1618
02:22:48,209 --> 02:22:52,850
Taxed one million not one million one million taxed already

1619
02:22:53,250 --> 02:22:55,809
So that would be like 1.4 million 1.5 million

1620
02:22:58,510 --> 02:23:04,379
It has to be taxed

1621
02:23:04,379 --> 02:23:12,510
That's what it would take deal. Okay. No, no deal. I'm not agreeing to it

1622
02:23:14,159 --> 02:23:19,200
A face tattoo of it. No, I would no not happening. There's no amount of money that would make me get a face tattoo

1623
02:23:20,379 --> 02:23:30,659
No amount set up a crowdfunding. We'll get it to 1.4 million. No, you will not that's a fucking absolute not it would never happen

1624
02:23:31,139 --> 02:23:39,379
That would never happen. It would never happen. I am so convinced that that would never hit 1.4 million

1625
02:23:46,690 --> 02:23:50,209
It has to go on my back like on my lower back

1626
02:23:51,250 --> 02:23:52,450
No way

1627
02:23:52,450 --> 02:23:54,450
No fucking way

1628
02:24:02,180 --> 02:24:06,420
That's not even worth one point what's not even worth one million taxed by the way

1629
02:24:06,500 --> 02:24:12,620
Right

1630
02:24:13,500 --> 02:24:18,659
And it would have to be that image that's on all the posters

1631
02:24:19,379 --> 02:24:23,899
Where you got like theodore on the left arms crossed leaning back

1632
02:24:24,700 --> 02:24:30,940
Simon on the right arms crossed leaning back and alvin in the middle arms crossed leaning back with sunglasses on

1633
02:24:32,700 --> 02:24:39,620
3d the 3d characters. That's I would need 1.4 million dollars to do that

1634
02:24:47,579 --> 02:24:52,319
What about waldo simbromet

1635
02:24:53,280 --> 02:24:56,989
That probably wouldn't be a million. I don't think I would need a million for that. They're like cool

1636
02:24:58,850 --> 02:25:00,610
That's like classic

1637
02:25:00,610 --> 02:25:07,250
Characters alvin and chipmunk are classic characters, but they're classic like money grab characters like they're like the smurfs

1638
02:25:16,209 --> 02:25:19,649
They brought back all these new franchises to try to like make them for kids

1639
02:25:20,290 --> 02:25:22,719
These are

1640
02:25:23,600 --> 02:25:27,280
Wallace and grommet is timeless. You don't need to like remake wallace and grommet to

1641
02:25:27,920 --> 02:25:30,239
Cater to like a 10 year old right now

1642
02:25:31,200 --> 02:25:32,719
You just make another wallace and grommet

1643
02:25:32,719 --> 02:25:35,920
You don't have to like remake then redesign them and bring the back for kids now

1644
02:25:36,319 --> 02:25:40,399
No, you just make another wallace and grommet. It's a timeless character. I would do that for fucking probably. I don't know

1645
02:25:41,780 --> 02:25:43,299
In that same spot

1646
02:25:43,299 --> 02:26:03,600
I have that 500k taxed. It's a stone crusher clan try also grab it holds up way more than it should

1647
02:26:04,239 --> 02:26:10,760
Why it's it's that's cool. It's really cool. It's claymation. First of all, it's really well done claymation

1648
02:26:11,459 --> 02:26:17,100
The characters are funny. It's like an old like man and his funny dog and they go eat like cheese from the moon and stuff

1649
02:26:17,100 --> 02:26:19,870
It's like that's timeless

1650
02:26:19,870 --> 02:26:25,149
Going to the moon to try the the planet's surface because you think it's cheese

1651
02:26:25,790 --> 02:26:28,030
And watching him spread it on the cracker and eat it

1652
02:26:29,059 --> 02:26:36,340
I wanted to eat it so bad when I was younger watching him take that gray chunk of that cheese moon shit and

1653
02:26:36,819 --> 02:26:40,100
Biting it. Oh my god. I wanted it so bad. I wanted to eat that so bad

1654
02:26:40,420 --> 02:26:48,340
I don't have that reaction when I watch alvin and the chipmunks

1655
02:26:51,360 --> 02:27:01,020
Lost at sea whatever the new movie was. I don't know. I want better uh better moves

1656
02:27:01,739 --> 02:27:10,659
Same and I don't even like cheese. Yeah, all right. What am I doing? Make contact with the hellfire clan

1657
02:27:15,540 --> 02:27:19,739
Chip wrecked the name of the movie was chip wrecked

1658
02:27:23,069 --> 02:27:31,280
That might be worse than putting two characters with and in the middle. In fact, it's absolutely it is. I need resources

1659
02:27:36,659 --> 02:27:42,100
Hellfire clan attacking they really they're they're rallying around the soul fountain after that soul

1660
02:27:44,819 --> 02:27:50,260
I need the tattoo fundraiser link

1661
02:27:51,379 --> 02:27:54,399
That's not how this works

1662
02:27:54,399 --> 02:28:02,719
It's not you guys make a fundraiser. No, it would be I would have to have an official an official account an official kickstarter campaign

1663
02:28:03,040 --> 02:28:08,020
Or official campaign onto my account name to do it

1664
02:28:09,340 --> 02:28:13,180
You know if somebody makes an account if somebody links you i'm gonna make this really clear

1665
02:28:13,420 --> 02:28:15,420
If someone links you an image

1666
02:28:15,420 --> 02:28:22,940
Not an image if somebody links you a link to a like fund page of me getting a alvin and the chipmunks ass tattoo

1667
02:28:23,500 --> 02:28:28,459
Whatever it was. It's not real. It's only real when I tell you it's mine

1668
02:28:28,860 --> 02:28:30,860
Do do not give any money to anybody

1669
02:28:31,180 --> 02:28:34,059
Don't give any money to anything

1670
02:28:34,059 --> 02:28:39,180
Only if I tell you it's my link and I link it and i'm the one that links it don't do that

1671
02:28:40,030 --> 02:28:49,489
Someone's gonna steal your money don't fuck around there's nothing to do with me and I am completely denouncing all of that

1672
02:28:49,729 --> 02:28:59,120
Don't do that. Don't fucking do it. I know one of you might think about it. I'll be furious if you do and I'd really mean that

1673
02:29:01,540 --> 02:29:07,219
I truly mean that if I do it you'll know

1674
02:29:08,530 --> 02:29:12,190
I'll have an official link in the channel. You'll know because I'll talk about it

1675
02:29:12,190 --> 02:29:20,750
I will say here is the link for the 1.4 million dollars to get a the alvin and chipmunks 3d

1676
02:29:21,149 --> 02:29:28,909
Ass tattoo or back tattoo here it is. You will only know that from me

1677
02:29:35,420 --> 02:29:39,659
I have to spend this much time on this. Do I have to really spend this much time here?

1678
02:29:40,159 --> 02:29:42,750
Why'd I have to spend this much time?

1679
02:29:42,750 --> 02:29:47,680
saying this

1680
02:29:55,899 --> 02:30:02,399
Huge omega lulls today, you're gonna sober up tomorrow and regret this bit

1681
02:30:03,680 --> 02:30:05,680
Fucking fine. I'm drinking water

1682
02:30:06,399 --> 02:30:08,399
Hellfire clans seek blood

1683
02:30:10,079 --> 02:30:13,360
I didn't agree to anything. I just told you if that ever were to happen

1684
02:30:13,680 --> 02:30:16,239
It would be coming from me and I have not agreed to that yet

1685
02:30:16,719 --> 02:30:30,940
All right, we gotta find the encampment. All right. I got a group here

1686
02:30:32,590 --> 02:30:35,549
Yet, I don't know him. I don't know what i'm gonna do

1687
02:30:45,819 --> 02:30:49,090
He's zonked get him

1688
02:30:49,090 --> 02:30:52,739
Okay, I find that I could find their lumber camp

1689
02:30:53,059 --> 02:31:01,440
And take it over

1690
02:31:01,440 --> 02:31:05,020
And then this game is actually pretty fun

1691
02:31:06,079 --> 02:31:08,559
Could you play this online with somebody if you could that's really cool

1692
02:31:09,280 --> 02:31:12,610
When he files for bankruptcy, he'll be back

1693
02:31:13,579 --> 02:31:15,100
To do that

1694
02:31:15,100 --> 02:31:19,739
Yeah, by the way, what's the um, how long do I have to do this? Like if let's say i'm retired

1695
02:31:20,829 --> 02:31:22,530
completely

1696
02:31:22,530 --> 02:31:24,530
Like five ten years go by

1697
02:31:25,549 --> 02:31:27,549
And like i'm like 50

1698
02:31:28,420 --> 02:31:30,260
i'm like 60

1699
02:31:30,260 --> 02:31:34,659
Can I come on twitter and say hey guys i'm opening up the uh,

1700
02:31:35,219 --> 02:31:39,940
The kickstarter for the alvin and the chipmunks 3d, uh back lower back tattoo

1701
02:31:40,500 --> 02:31:43,739
Please contribute here. Is that would you guys still do it?

1702
02:31:45,809 --> 02:31:49,729
No, what would happen realistically is that would get like two retweets

1703
02:31:50,610 --> 02:31:54,450
And like four likes on that tweet and there would be no replies

1704
02:31:55,090 --> 02:31:59,250
And no one would pay for and no one would do you guys aren't even they're not gonna be like on twitter anymore

1705
02:31:59,489 --> 02:32:07,899
It would be just a weird desperate attempt for me to like come back and just take money from people. It'd be weird

1706
02:32:15,500 --> 02:32:20,049
Get a time splitters tattoo

1707
02:32:20,049 --> 02:32:21,170
I don't

1708
02:32:21,170 --> 02:32:23,090
I'm not I don't have any tattoos

1709
02:32:23,090 --> 02:32:29,389
I told you guys the tattoo that I was gonna get a long time ago when I never did it and i'm kind of glad

1710
02:32:29,469 --> 02:32:30,670
I didn't

1711
02:32:30,670 --> 02:32:32,670
I was gonna get the venom symbol

1712
02:32:33,309 --> 02:32:34,409
on my

1713
02:32:34,409 --> 02:32:41,219
Shoulder and I swear to god something happens to your brain when you when you get like jacked

1714
02:32:41,870 --> 02:32:49,389
Like I was fucking huge. I was like 160 170 pounds and i'm like five eight. I was I was a inflated

1715
02:32:49,950 --> 02:32:53,389
Swole fucking massive person. I was huge and I was always lifting

1716
02:32:53,790 --> 02:32:57,389
I was really in shape when you get like that. It does something to your brain

1717
02:32:58,459 --> 02:33:03,739
I'm gonna get like the spider-man tattoo. I'm i'm spider-man like I really thought that I was like spider-man

1718
02:33:04,219 --> 02:33:06,860
Yeah, this is like what spider-man looks like i'm spider-man

1719
02:33:07,180 --> 02:33:10,879
I'm gonna get the venom tattoo because I've like looked like venom

1720
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:12,719
I don't know what it does

1721
02:33:12,719 --> 02:33:17,040
It does something into like inside the chemistry in your brain and it makes you like think you're a superhero or something

1722
02:33:17,520 --> 02:33:21,940
So I was gonna get the venom symbol

1723
02:33:22,180 --> 02:33:28,979
Across the shoulder and like down around the back and around my arm and it would have looked sick

1724
02:33:29,620 --> 02:33:32,020
With like my shirt off like just jacked in the mirror

1725
02:33:32,020 --> 02:33:37,180
It would be this like like those lines and i'd be like fuck. Yeah, i'd be at the beach

1726
02:33:37,969 --> 02:33:43,329
It'd be like wow look at that. That guy's that guy's jacked and he has a venom tattoo that guy's venom

1727
02:33:43,809 --> 02:33:47,440
But I didn't want to be venom. I wanted to be I wanted to be venom suit spider-man

1728
02:33:49,459 --> 02:33:56,450
I didn't want to be venom. I wanted to be spider-man with the venom suit on but i'm glad I didn't

1729
02:34:00,340 --> 02:34:04,979
Because I've turned to the kind of i've gotten a little frumpy and that part of my brain turned off

1730
02:34:06,319 --> 02:34:08,319
I'm no longer like jacked spider-man

1731
02:34:08,879 --> 02:34:12,780
And i'd be like, oh shit, I have like I have like the superhero tattoo now

1732
02:34:13,340 --> 02:34:15,280
Maybe I wouldn't have stopped

1733
02:34:15,280 --> 02:34:18,639
Maybe that would have been enough motivation for me to not to like to get just to keep going to the gym

1734
02:34:18,879 --> 02:34:28,909
Maybe I fucked up maybe having the venom tattoo on the shoulder was what needed to be there

1735
02:34:29,149 --> 02:34:46,379
So I would continue to be spider-man in the venom suit. Oh, well, that's like getting a marijuana leaf tattooed on you

1736
02:34:46,860 --> 02:34:52,049
Because you like weed

1737
02:34:52,049 --> 02:34:54,049
Well

1738
02:34:58,700 --> 02:35:00,700
But why does anybody get a tattoo

1739
02:35:01,020 --> 02:35:03,500
Like what does anybody get like a tattoo like that?

1740
02:35:04,450 --> 02:35:07,729
It's because like you I don't know. It's like cool or it means something, right?

1741
02:35:16,559 --> 02:35:20,819
We tattoo for two million. That's not that's like not that big of a deal

1742
02:35:29,700 --> 02:35:32,979
You know a long time ago burger boy was gonna get wario tattooed on his ass

1743
02:35:34,879 --> 02:35:36,879
shooting a fireball like

1744
02:35:36,959 --> 02:35:38,959
To it like towards his like butt

1745
02:35:39,200 --> 02:35:42,379
I think that didn't happen

1746
02:35:42,379 --> 02:35:53,520
It would have been yeah, it would have been glorious

1747
02:35:54,059 --> 02:35:55,659
But that's the kind of tattoo that's like, okay

1748
02:35:55,659 --> 02:35:57,899
That's like funny and like wow about like an interesting

1749
02:35:58,299 --> 02:36:00,620
What an interesting person you may have you must have been right?

1750
02:36:00,620 --> 02:36:03,819
Like what a what a crazy cool fun life you may have had right?

1751
02:36:04,459 --> 02:36:08,059
Getting like the spider-man tattoo on your shoulder is like i'm jacked

1752
02:36:12,270 --> 02:36:13,790
In my brain at least

1753
02:36:13,790 --> 02:36:16,290
How much for a twitch tv tattoo?

1754
02:36:16,530 --> 02:36:23,200
What do you mean like the twitch like the whatever the glitchy the icon?

1755
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:33,760
I'd rather get alvin than chipmunks. I would rather get alvin and the chipmunks for free

1756
02:36:34,559 --> 02:36:48,780
On the lower back then get a twitch.tv glitch tattoo for money. I don't know

1757
02:36:50,319 --> 02:36:52,319
I don't know something about that just sits weird to me

1758
02:36:52,559 --> 02:36:58,510
I don't know why like I just feel like I feel like that's a kind of

1759
02:36:59,309 --> 02:37:01,840
Oh, I beat it

1760
02:37:01,840 --> 02:37:03,840
Where would it be and how big does it have to be?

1761
02:37:05,459 --> 02:37:07,459
That the twitch glitch tattoo

1762
02:37:07,940 --> 02:37:09,780
How big does that have to be?

1763
02:37:09,780 --> 02:37:13,020
Because if it was small

1764
02:37:13,020 --> 02:37:17,520
Like if it was like a emote sized or something that would be kind of cute like get that like on like your

1765
02:37:18,079 --> 02:37:20,879
Like your wrist or something or on like your forearm like that's cute

1766
02:37:20,959 --> 02:37:30,989
I don't I don't have a problem with that. How big does it have to be huge?

1767
02:37:33,120 --> 02:37:40,690
No, I don't think i'd want to do it on your forehead. No

1768
02:37:41,250 --> 02:37:54,219
I wouldn't get any tattoo on my forehead. What happened? Oh head b oops

1769
02:37:59,379 --> 02:38:01,659
Oink oink boom

1770
02:38:01,659 --> 02:38:09,870
On your cheek

1771
02:38:09,870 --> 02:38:12,190
On your bald spot. I don't have a bald spot

1772
02:38:17,569 --> 02:38:20,129
Inner lip. Oh, no, I don't think so. No, thanks

1773
02:38:26,700 --> 02:38:32,139
Which url

1774
02:38:33,659 --> 02:38:35,579
No, I don't want that because that's not gonna be

1775
02:38:37,500 --> 02:38:41,579
That's a weird advertisement for something that's not gonna not gonna exist anymore mentally

1776
02:38:48,829 --> 02:38:51,579
Why don't you do that?

1777
02:38:53,500 --> 02:38:56,700
QR code tattoo and it links to rick roll

1778
02:38:59,659 --> 02:39:01,469
can't wait to

1779
02:39:01,469 --> 02:39:03,469
Do that a thousand times

1780
02:39:03,549 --> 02:39:07,520
All right. So now

1781
02:39:07,520 --> 02:39:09,520
Investigate the hellfire gunpowder factory

1782
02:39:11,100 --> 02:39:14,299
Not yet. I want one of these guys 140

1783

02:39:19,809 --> 02:39:29,299
Oh, that's new

02:39:29,299 --> 02:39:34,020
Medium melee. All right. That's good. That's a good group tons of health

1788
02:39:34,579 --> 02:39:45,250
Now let's go find it. What about a rat tattoo? Uh, that would be fun. I wouldn't be opposed to that

1789
02:39:52,860 --> 02:39:54,860
That's that does it for me. I think that's cool

1790
02:40:01,440 --> 02:40:13,170
What just happened I was laughing about chipwrecked can these guys eat?

1791
02:40:18,860 --> 02:40:28,049
I'm gonna get i'm gonna get i'm gonna get jack and dexter tattooed on my back

He's gonna be holding the chicken gun

1793
02:40:33,819 --> 02:40:51,420
This is the chainsaw sounds because I need more people. Hold on keep fighting

1794
02:40:52,059 --> 02:41:00,059
Everybody died

1795
02:41:00,059 --> 02:41:02,059
Oh, it's because the factory blew up

1796
02:41:02,299 --> 02:41:08,420
Homer simpson. Yes, i'll get okay homer simpson

1797
02:41:09,700 --> 02:41:13,500
Holding the pink donut standing straight up heels on the ground

1798
02:41:13,739 --> 02:41:18,860
Just standing in just a regular position with his arm up pink donut has a single bite out of it

1799
02:41:19,729 --> 02:41:21,969
Frosting side is facing the camera

1800
02:41:21,969 --> 02:41:36,590
And he has a little wad chew kind of in his mouth side of his mouth. That's pretty epic. Yeah

1801
02:41:39,629 --> 02:41:41,629
also the great tattoo and you're

1802
02:41:46,219 --> 02:41:50,719
My god like that's the kind of tattoo

1803
02:41:51,600 --> 02:41:58,110
That you just get up one day and you're like what the fuck is going on with my life?

1804
02:41:58,190 --> 02:42:00,270
What's happening to my what's going on?

1805
02:42:04,430 --> 02:42:06,860
right

1806
02:42:06,860 --> 02:42:21,020
Investigate the gunpowder factory. Okay, let's go back to sneak king

1807
02:42:21,020 --> 02:42:22,620
We're gonna move on to the next game

1808
02:42:22,620 --> 02:42:25,020
And the next game is gonna lock me there for a long time

1809
02:42:25,100 --> 02:42:30,219
And I think half of you are gonna be very excited and the other half are gonna be very pissed off that it's I even

1810
02:42:30,379 --> 02:42:33,280
Picked it in the first place

1811
02:42:33,280 --> 02:42:35,280
I guarantee

1812
02:42:36,059 --> 02:42:41,520
100 guarantee this game will be played for at least a full hour. I guarantee it

1813
02:42:44,190 --> 02:42:49,680
It's guaranteed

1814
02:42:49,680 --> 02:42:52,319
Somebody's still fighting back here. Wait. Hey, that's mine. Give me that

1815
02:42:54,860 --> 02:42:56,379
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa

1816
02:42:56,379 --> 02:43:04,459
Can't see anything. It's not skylanders

1817
02:43:05,020 --> 02:43:13,629
Don't you guys feel like skylanders was like five years a little too early?

1818
02:43:19,340 --> 02:43:28,059
Just barely I still have that right? I think so don't have it

1819
02:43:31,879 --> 02:43:41,360
140 almost can get the uh the ogre like if they had just waited for technology to get just a little bit better even

1820
02:43:42,079 --> 02:43:46,370
It probably would have been a thousand times more popular than it is now, but then it was

1821
02:43:46,850 --> 02:43:56,780
We'll give me that

1822
02:43:56,780 --> 02:43:59,659
It's you have to claim sponsorship money. That's what we're gonna watch

1823
02:44:01,420 --> 02:44:06,879
Um, no, all right, bring on the big guy

1824
02:44:11,090 --> 02:44:16,639
I'm not fucking around anymore. Let's go

1825
02:44:16,639 --> 02:44:23,020
Game part of it sucked. I didn't play skylanders. I just knew what it was

1826
02:44:23,739 --> 02:44:26,059
I was like, oh, that's kind of interesting how that works

1827
02:44:26,780 --> 02:44:34,989
I can just eat people

1828
02:44:34,989 --> 02:44:39,020
Why play as any other character?

1829
02:44:39,020 --> 02:44:49,729
This is so much better

1830
02:44:49,729 --> 02:44:54,530
I lose health for eating these guys now

1831
02:44:54,530 --> 02:44:57,020
All right, you stay here and claim this

1832
02:44:57,020 --> 02:44:58,780
Can he claim this by himself?

1833
02:45:00,899 --> 02:45:07,950
Later levels get really hard to make kids spend money kind of weird to hear

1834
02:45:11,010 --> 02:45:12,129
Oh shit

1835
02:45:12,129 --> 02:45:24,700
All right, go get him. They dead wait. No, no, no, no, no, no, don't do this. I gotta get more troops

1836
02:45:25,420 --> 02:45:39,200
Upgrade their gear. What am I doing? Yeah, look at that. Now we're gonna take it over. When is the next game?

1837
02:45:40,159 --> 02:45:45,440
Um after my first break which will be in precisely after this level

1838
02:45:46,239 --> 02:45:51,040
I'm gonna go pee and come back and we're gonna move to the next game. The next game is gonna be wow

1839
02:45:53,500 --> 02:45:54,879
Really wonder

1840
02:45:54,879 --> 02:45:56,559
What the response will be?

1841
02:45:56,559 --> 02:46:01,469
Oh what they're already going over there shit. Hurry up

1842
02:46:08,020 --> 02:46:11,540
Eat eat them both. They'll take it over

1843
02:46:11,940 --> 02:46:17,139
This game's pretty fun. I could see how this would be really popular

1844
02:46:17,780 --> 02:46:24,860
I'm coming. I don't fit here

1845
02:46:30,100 --> 02:46:31,540
Wow, let's go

1846
02:46:31,540 --> 02:46:35,500
It's not world of warcraft. It's not an mmo

1847
02:46:35,819 --> 02:46:40,850
He's what you think I wouldn't you think I would do that to you right now?

1848
02:46:43,340 --> 02:46:47,420
Unlike the one stream you get a week. You think i'm gonna play world of warcraft for like two hours

1849
02:46:48,059 --> 02:46:54,659
All right, where's this gunpowder place?

1850
02:47:00,819 --> 02:47:04,500
Okay, I will make somebody i'm gonna make sure i'm gonna make everybody really really calm here

1851
02:47:05,059 --> 02:47:10,430
It's not league of legends. If you think it's league of legends and you're like goddamn it. It's probably league

1852
02:47:10,829 --> 02:47:14,350
He's gonna do a stupid joke where he plays league. He's like, oh once a week and he plays league

1853
02:47:15,149 --> 02:47:17,149
If league of legends shows up on this stream

1854
02:47:19,340 --> 02:47:24,459
I will get the alvin and the chipmunks 3d ass tattoo for free like immediately the next day

1855
02:47:26,479 --> 02:47:28,479
If you see league of legends

1856
02:47:28,479 --> 02:47:30,399
Show up on this stream

1857
02:47:30,399 --> 02:47:32,399
And what I mean by that is me

1858
02:47:32,899 --> 02:47:34,739
Playing league of legends

1859
02:47:34,739 --> 02:47:38,739
I'm playing it sitting there and oh, yeah league of legends. Cool. This is fun

1860
02:47:38,739 --> 02:47:42,340
I'm playing the game me streaming it not opening a video

1861
02:47:43,120 --> 02:47:49,760
Not talking about it. I mean physically sitting here playing league of legends on my twitch tv

1862
02:47:49,760 --> 02:47:54,780
Okay, here I am playing the game me if that happens

1863
02:47:55,579 --> 02:47:59,819
I will get the alvin and the chipmunks ass tattoo the next day. Now. Why is it always ass? It's like back

1864
02:47:59,979 --> 02:48:04,659
I keep saying ass

1865
02:48:14,459 --> 02:48:18,770
An ass tattoo perhaps there is another way

1866
02:48:25,459 --> 02:48:32,239
We still have not forgotten about three stooges in fortnight. It's gonna happen. It doesn't I could take a I could take five more years

1867
02:48:32,319 --> 02:48:43,090
It's gonna happen

1868
02:48:43,090 --> 02:48:45,969
It's gonna they're gonna open up like oh seasons eight

1869
02:48:46,930 --> 02:48:48,930
season 10 like

1870
02:48:51,729 --> 02:48:54,290
Gonna be black and white it's gonna open up black and white

1871
02:48:55,090 --> 02:49:00,979
They're gonna come over and they're gonna like

1872
02:49:01,459 --> 02:49:10,059
They're on season 18. It's too much. It's too many seasons

1873
02:49:11,180 --> 02:49:12,860
They're breaking the rule

1874
02:49:12,860 --> 02:49:18,139
More than seven seasons of any media. It becomes bad. We talked about this like a week ago. We already talked about it

1875
02:49:18,700 --> 02:49:20,700
Do I have to reiterate it for you?

1876
02:49:24,940 --> 02:49:26,139
Collect this

1877
02:49:26,139 --> 02:49:34,829
I'm for a reboot

1878
02:49:34,829 --> 02:49:37,260
That's when they rebooted fortnight

1879
02:49:37,659 --> 02:49:42,510
Destroy it. All right, kill these guys

1880
02:49:47,489 --> 02:49:50,049
All right. I'll get it next time. Maybe not maybe we can do it now

1881
02:49:50,770 --> 02:49:55,440
You stole that bit from community

1882
02:49:55,920 --> 02:49:59,059
I've never seen community

1883
02:49:59,059 --> 02:50:01,059
I've seen one episode of community

1884
02:50:02,430 --> 02:50:07,629
It's the one where they talk about like the chicken fingers being back at like the cafeteria or something

1885
02:50:07,709 --> 02:50:11,549
I was like, oh this is kind of funny. I've now i've only seen one full episode maybe two

1886
02:50:17,010 --> 02:50:19,500
That was good. It was very funny

1887
02:50:20,500 --> 02:50:28,860
That's the only like i've only seen two episodes. I don't really watch tv. I don't do it guys. I don't watch like media

1888
02:50:29,500 --> 02:50:31,469
I'm such a weirdo

1889
02:50:31,469 --> 02:50:33,889
Oh my god. I'm so weird. I'm such like a weirdo

1890
02:50:34,610 --> 02:50:44,590
All right, they have molten hammers

1891
02:50:49,469 --> 02:50:56,180
You can't get much better than that already come to me

1892
02:51:08,209 --> 02:51:10,209
You have to watch this guy he's so quirky

1893
02:51:10,370 --> 02:51:16,180
I know dude, you gotta you gotta watch this guy was wicked funny

1894
02:51:16,579 --> 02:51:22,819
He did he was doing a routine where he said those the three stooges were gonna go be into and put it in fortnight

1895
02:51:22,899 --> 02:51:27,780
He has this like bet with his chat and he started playing a song. He started doing the willy wonka

1896
02:51:28,260 --> 02:51:31,940
Golden ticket song as if it was a three stooges intro or something

1897
02:51:31,940 --> 02:51:34,819
Like how does this guy's mind work? Like what the heck?

1898
02:51:35,379 --> 02:51:38,500
That's so weird. What the hell why that's not even the right thing

1899
02:51:48,190 --> 02:51:50,190
Final battle incoming troll versus troll

1900
02:51:53,040 --> 02:51:55,040
You're piggy piggy piggy

1901
02:51:57,579 --> 02:52:05,280
Yep, let's go

1902
02:52:05,280 --> 02:52:09,700
go

1903
02:52:41,020 --> 02:52:48,110
It just gave me a headache i'm sorry

1904
02:52:49,149 --> 02:52:51,149
I'm sorry. They gave you a headache

1905
02:52:51,549 --> 02:52:53,889
Why did they give you a headache? Are you all right?

1906
02:52:54,450 --> 02:53:04,020
Does he listen to pokemon music before streams?

1907
02:53:04,100 --> 02:53:06,530
Yes

1908
02:53:07,729 --> 02:53:09,729
I've never played a pokemon game

1909
02:53:10,370 --> 02:53:14,450
I'm just mashing together the things that it's like an ai algorithm in my brain

1910
02:53:15,790 --> 02:53:22,180
I'm I took what I played in the smash brothers games the background music that was pokemon related

1911
02:53:22,819 --> 02:53:24,819
and ai

1912
02:53:25,219 --> 02:53:31,780
Quantum imagination to created it. I've got a quantum fucking imagination. I've never played a pokemon game

1913
02:53:32,420 --> 02:53:42,270
I'll watch out for the explosion. I need to eat something

1914
02:53:46,350 --> 02:53:47,389
Fuck

1915
02:53:47,389 --> 02:53:49,389
Everybody fine. Everybody's fine

1916
02:53:49,790 --> 02:54:00,719
Just take out their

1917
02:54:00,719 --> 02:54:02,639
Take this out

1918
02:54:02,639 --> 02:54:06,530
fight fight

1919
02:54:23,979 --> 02:54:27,180
They have cannons it's not fair i'm about to quit the game

1920
02:54:28,770 --> 02:54:40,940
Not yet. They fully upgraded why can only have 10 these guys attack

1921
02:54:41,739 --> 02:54:43,739
This guy's these guys defense is terrible

1922
02:54:43,739 --> 02:54:48,780
Can I upgrade these guys at all?

1923
02:54:48,780 --> 02:54:50,059
Where can I put this?

1924
02:54:50,059 --> 02:54:59,280
I can put this near a fountain, right?

1925
02:54:59,280 --> 02:55:16,450
Stay with this guy don't do that. We can remember every pokemon smash background music

1926
02:55:16,450 --> 02:55:18,850
We can't remember the u.s national anthem

1927
02:55:19,329 --> 02:55:21,329
What a liberal?

1928
02:55:25,840 --> 02:55:31,760
That's doesn't okay the pokemon background music battle music doesn't have lyrics

1929
02:55:34,540 --> 02:55:36,540
I can go

1930
02:55:42,049 --> 02:55:44,540
I can do that

1931
02:55:45,500 --> 02:56:03,500
I don't do lyrics. I i'm a bird

1932
02:56:06,049 --> 02:56:12,420
I just repeat things like this repeats sounds. All right, watch out. Watch out. Watch out come this way this way this way

1933
02:56:13,139 --> 02:56:16,780
No, no, no, no, no, no

1934
02:56:17,020 --> 02:56:18,540
God damn it

1935
02:56:18,540 --> 02:56:27,540
head to the cannon

1936
02:56:27,540 --> 02:56:28,340
rush

1937
02:56:28,340 --> 02:56:35,760
This game is a snooze fest bro

1938
02:56:37,219 --> 02:56:40,260
Ban him ban him and don't let him come back ban him and don't let him come back

1939
02:56:48,450 --> 02:56:51,790
ban him

1940
02:56:51,790 --> 02:56:53,309
This is my

1941
02:56:53,309 --> 02:56:56,430
You're gonna mess with my stream and talk about how the game i'm playing is not good

1942
02:56:57,069 --> 02:57:01,549
It's what I think is is fun and good. Okay, get out of here get out of here

1943
02:57:13,620 --> 02:57:15,389
It's boring

1944
02:57:15,389 --> 02:57:18,590
Well, it doesn't matter what is having fun. It's xbox 360 night

1945
02:57:19,149 --> 02:57:23,489
I'm just stalling to get to the real game because that's the game that's gonna

1946
02:57:24,129 --> 02:57:27,090
Oh, i'm gonna get trapped for like at least a few hours

1947
02:57:29,819 --> 02:57:39,149
This game's pretty fun

1948
02:57:39,309 --> 02:57:41,309
Do

1949
02:57:49,920 --> 02:57:52,000

I like love that game and I love that sound. Oh, that's a joe and mac

1951
02:58:07,459 --> 02:58:09,459

02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:24,719
Just trying to find reasons to get the tattoo

1954
02:58:26,139 --> 02:58:30,780
Oh shit, oh man, I lost. Oh, I have to get the alphan the chipmunk's tattoo on my ass

1955
02:58:30,860 --> 02:58:33,739
Oh, what the heck? That's so stupid. That sucks

1956
02:58:34,620 --> 02:58:37,059
Fine. I'll book it tomorrow. Oh

1957
02:58:37,379 --> 02:58:41,059
No, can I what can I do gonna do something I can do to make that not happen?

1958
02:58:41,700 --> 02:58:46,639
All right, let's go. This was fun

1959
02:58:46,639 --> 02:58:50,399
But i'm we're moving on and i'm not gonna even tell you what this is until you fucking see it

1960
02:58:50,719 --> 02:58:56,000
So let's go brb and i'm gonna open up on the next game and everyone's gonna be furious or happy. Not sure

1961
02:58:56,479 --> 03:05:44,899
See you in a minute

1962
03:05:44,899 --> 03:05:46,739
Okay, i'm back

1963
03:05:46,739 --> 03:05:50,819
All right. That took a little longer. I really wanted I wanted another coffee

1964
03:05:51,620 --> 03:05:54,180
I wanted a coffee and I was gonna make it

1965
03:05:54,659 --> 03:05:56,879
I did

1966
03:05:56,879 --> 03:05:59,200
Okay. So, um the next game we're gonna play

1967
03:06:00,260 --> 03:06:02,020
I will put on the music

1968
03:06:02,020 --> 03:06:11,979
So you can hear what the intro is. This is the next thing i'm gonna be doing. This is the opening

1969
03:06:14,350 --> 03:06:21,649
What could that be?

1970
03:06:28,610 --> 03:06:30,290
Yes, you can you can hear it

1971
03:06:30,290 --> 03:06:32,829
I don't even know sound yes, you can you can hear this

1972
03:06:33,469 --> 03:06:40,639
What do you mean you can't hear this it says you can

1973
03:06:41,600 --> 03:06:44,739
There's literally no sound what?

1974
03:06:44,739 --> 03:06:48,510
Oh, all right. Who cares about the surprise?

1975
03:06:50,020 --> 03:06:52,020
It's high rollers casino

1976
03:06:52,579 --> 03:06:54,739
You walk around and you play casino games

1977
03:06:56,420 --> 03:06:58,420
Oh, here we go

1978
03:06:59,170 --> 03:07:09,579
Get yourselves ready. I got a coffee for this one. This is the game of the night right here. You couldn't hear this intro

1979
03:07:10,139 --> 03:07:13,540
Oh, no, no, no, no spoilers. I don't want any spoilers

1980
03:07:14,750 --> 03:07:22,299
Uh, the screen looks fucked up though

1981
03:07:22,379 --> 03:07:30,370
Like not what I mean, it's like the bars on the bottom and top are too big

1982
03:07:34,829 --> 03:07:38,510
That good

1983
03:07:38,510 --> 03:07:42,290
How's that look? It's better, right?

1984
03:07:42,610 --> 03:07:47,729
No more to the left

1985
03:07:47,729 --> 03:07:52,620
Good

1986
03:07:52,620 --> 03:07:55,500
IGN gave this game a one out of ten. Did they really?

1987
03:07:59,229 --> 03:08:00,909

All right burger gym sucks. They're worth five cents each. Oh

2087
03:17:18,620 --> 03:17:21,020
You started with 8 50. I started with a thousand

2088
03:17:22,879 --> 03:17:24,879
I accidentally did a 250 dollar bet

2089
03:17:25,440 --> 03:17:29,000
All right burger gyms not fun

2090
03:17:29,000 --> 03:17:33,209
You guys are all idiots for playing burger gym. It's the worst one rock and roll though on the other hand

2091
03:17:33,770 --> 03:17:42,010
All right rock and roll you are a human being with access to a computer which you appear to be

2092
03:17:42,809 --> 03:17:48,010
There are 100 million programs that can do this better before you seek them out. Please set me on fire some pain stops

2093
03:17:48,489 --> 03:17:50,489
That's an ign review

2094
03:17:50,649 --> 03:17:54,489
Okay, how about 25 cents?

2095
03:17:55,049 --> 03:17:56,250

03:18:41,149 --> 03:18:45,200

2104
03:18:51,469 --> 03:18:53,469
I miss burger gym

2105
03:18:54,030 --> 03:18:56,030
Um

2106
03:18:56,989 --> 03:19:03,600
This doesn't make any this is needlessly complicated. Yeah, why this is very needlessly complicated

2107
03:19:10,250 --> 03:19:15,559
For some reason this game makes me feel really sad it does why

2108
03:19:18,620 --> 03:19:21,290
It makes you sad

2109
03:19:22,569 --> 03:19:24,250
Bonus rock come on

2110
03:19:24,250 --> 03:19:26,729
I just got scatter. What happened? I just want a bunch of money

2111
03:19:29,229 --> 03:19:31,229
I'm up. I'm up almost 100 bucks

2112
03:19:34,040 --> 03:19:36,040
Cash it out. All right, let's keep going

2113
03:19:36,440 --> 03:19:44,920
What else is here? It's like 30 games to play

2114
03:19:45,719 --> 03:19:50,620
I would rather watch the templar game, honestly

2115
03:19:51,340 --> 03:19:55,920
Oh shit

2116
03:19:55,920 --> 03:20:01,760
Come on. I saw like I saw the third person guy walking around casino. I had to get it

2117
03:20:03,020 --> 03:20:05,020
All right. What about fruits jackpot?

2118
03:20:12,280 --> 03:20:21,629
It's gonna be the same one. Isn't it? This is 10 bucks, right? No, how much is that 50?

2119
03:20:22,110 --> 03:20:25,420
Oh fuck, okay, that's this is a lot of money

2120
03:20:29,760 --> 03:20:36,700
Nice

2121
03:20:36,700 --> 03:20:42,639
All right. Um, this sucks. Stop. Wait, let me at least get to a million. That's not gonna happen, man

2122
03:20:46,000 --> 03:20:58,020
Let me at least play blackjack. This is a bargain bin stream. It's original xbox

2123
03:21:02,139 --> 03:21:03,739
I didn't get a bonus

2124
03:21:03,739 --> 03:21:12,159
All right, this game the game sucks, okay the game sucks it's terrible it's awful

2125
03:21:15,209 --> 03:21:17,610
I'll give that all right. I give it to you. Hold on. Let me just put some more coins

2126
03:21:21,950 --> 03:21:42,239
This game's bad it's really bad

2127
03:21:42,479 --> 03:21:54,459
I've been playing for 10 minutes and we need another 20 minutes. It's lots of so confusing

2128
03:21:54,940 --> 03:21:57,500
Well, they're not really it's just for some reason this game decided to

2129
03:21:58,620 --> 03:22:04,719
I don't know why they added all these weird things to do. What does it describe the taste?

2130
03:22:05,600 --> 03:22:06,959
um

2131
03:22:06,959 --> 03:22:08,959
I'm like pissed. Look at my guy

2132
03:22:10,889 --> 03:22:12,889
I'm crying

2133
03:22:12,889 --> 03:22:14,889
No, this is I don't like this

2134
03:22:15,530 --> 03:22:19,690
We got to go to the blackjack table

2135
03:22:23,229 --> 03:22:25,229
I'm fucking furious

2136
03:22:25,719 --> 03:22:28,479
blackjack

2137
03:22:28,479 --> 03:22:36,430
One dollar stick. All right. This is this makes much more sense to me. What happens if I get to zero?

2138
03:22:39,149 --> 03:22:43,069
One billion off the debt if you can make it to one million from your current bank. Welcome to blackjack

2139
03:22:45,159 --> 03:22:46,959
Okay, here we go

2140
03:22:46,959 --> 03:22:49,959

2142
03:22:53,340 --> 03:22:55,549
50 dollar hands

2144
03:22:56,670 --> 03:23:02,280

2145
03:23:02,600 --> 03:23:05,000

03:23:12,010 --> 03:23:16,559
How do I put the bet up there?

2149
03:23:16,559 --> 03:23:22,680
What?

2150
03:23:22,680 --> 03:23:26,459
I didn't am I even playing?

2151
03:23:29,340 --> 03:23:31,340
You stand against the six

2152
03:23:33,040 --> 03:23:35,040
And i'm fucking lost

2153
03:23:45,819 --> 03:23:49,659
It's 11 versus 8. I'm probably gonna is probably 18

2318
03:40:58,239 --> 03:41:01,840
How do I hold these?

2319
03:41:01,840 --> 03:41:03,840
I want to do the double sixes

2320
03:41:04,079 --> 03:41:08,250
It's not what I wanted to do. Okay. Here we go

2321
03:41:09,579 --> 03:41:11,739
We're looking for what's three of kind. What do I get for three of kind?

2322
03:41:13,920 --> 03:41:17,840
I need another six

2323
03:41:17,840 --> 03:41:21,639

2324
03:41:21,639 --> 03:41:32,959
Hold the queens hold the queens these three queens four queens. What do I win? I won five dollars

2325
03:41:33,520 --> 03:41:42,520

2326
03:41:43,239 --> 03:41:45,290
now hold the five

2327
03:41:45,290 --> 03:41:59,579
Oh, how much am I actually betting? You didn't get yahtzee. This is not yahtzee here

2328
03:42:00,540 --> 03:42:02,780
Hold the aces and the fives looking for a full house

2329
03:42:03,420 --> 03:42:06,239
It's a full house. Give me a lot. Come on

2330
03:42:09,149 --> 03:42:10,350

2331
03:42:10,350 --> 03:42:11,389

2332
03:42:11,389 --> 03:42:17,690
Go for the flush

2333
03:42:17,690 --> 03:42:23,180

All right cash that out

2336
03:42:26,540 --> 03:42:27,500
All right

2337
03:42:27,500 --> 03:42:29,930
That's not bad

2338
03:42:36,090 --> 03:42:38,649
Oh, fuck. I just bet everything how much was that? Those 300 dollars

2339
03:42:39,290 --> 03:42:45,229
What I just do i'm going for aces

2340
03:42:45,629 --> 03:42:52,719
Come on aces

2341
03:42:54,399 --> 03:42:58,079

2342
03:42:58,079 --> 03:42:59,120

2343
03:42:59,120 --> 03:43:13,659
We're betting 50 call for it. All right max bet is 50 bucks. Let's do it

2344
03:43:14,299 --> 03:43:18,030
What do I hold here?

2345
03:43:18,030 --> 03:43:20,110
Gang gang the 10 go for a straight

2346
03:43:21,920 --> 03:43:23,920
Bingo. I don't know. I have no idea what that was

2347
03:43:30,700 --> 03:43:32,360
all threes

2348
03:43:32,360 --> 03:43:41,360
Go hold the uh, I don't know the the the the

2350
03:43:52,250 --> 03:43:54,250
Hold the jack and nothing else

2351
03:43:56,590 --> 03:43:58,670
Four three four. I need six

2352
03:44:00,360 --> 03:44:01,239
No

2353
03:44:01,239 --> 03:44:04,969
This game's not even fun

2354
03:44:04,969 --> 03:44:15,450
This game's not even fun

2355
03:44:18,010 --> 03:44:22,459
All right, i'm gonna get a royal flush and it's gonna give me four billion dollars or whatever the hell that is

2356
03:44:25,309 --> 03:44:27,149
Oh, no

2357
03:44:27,149 --> 03:44:32,590
What's the actual odds to get a royal flush? Isn't it like one in a hundred trillion? It's like impossible, isn't it?

2358
03:44:35,899 --> 03:44:41,659
Let's see four five six seven eight nine. What do we got ten nine ten nine eight seven six

2359
03:44:43,979 --> 03:44:45,979
It's one in two point six million

2360
03:44:47,180 --> 03:45:00,270
That's impossible

2361
03:45:00,270 --> 03:45:03,079
Sevens throw everything else away go

2362
03:45:08,799 --> 03:45:10,799
This is not even this is just a weird

2363
03:45:11,520 --> 03:45:14,479
Watch somebody just lose at a casino game

2364
03:45:16,520 --> 03:45:18,680
Vegas steaks for the snas was like funny

2365
03:45:19,159 --> 03:45:22,040
It would come up and be weirdos and stuff and you'd get like crazy scenarios

2366
03:45:22,040 --> 03:45:26,520
This is just i'm sitting at a machine just losing a hundred up five hundred dollars

2367
03:45:27,159 --> 03:45:28,680
Is that that's it?

2368
03:45:28,680 --> 03:45:32,219
There's nothing else going on

2369
03:45:32,219 --> 03:45:34,219
Just watch me lose at a casino

2370
03:45:39,229 --> 03:45:41,229
No shit. I wanted to select that

2371
03:45:41,469 --> 03:45:43,229
Oh my god

2372
03:45:43,229 --> 03:45:45,559
whole house

2373
03:45:45,559 --> 03:45:48,440
This is the turnaround writer

2374
03:45:48,440 --> 03:45:50,440
There it is what I get for that

2375
03:45:50,840 --> 03:45:53,600
I lost a hundred bucks. That's what I got

2376
03:45:53,680 --> 03:45:54,719
new game

2377
03:45:54,719 --> 03:46:02,920
You should have listened to IGN

2378
03:46:02,920 --> 03:46:08,620
Return to vegas steaks. I beat vegas steaks. I got to like 10 million dollars in vegas steaks

2379
03:46:08,940 --> 03:46:20,250
This is a very good anti-gambling psa. Yes, it should be

2380
03:46:20,809 --> 03:46:25,659
If you go to a casino you were going there to entertain yourself. You're not going there to make money

2381
03:46:27,690 --> 03:46:29,690
It's there for entertainment value

2382
03:46:31,690 --> 03:46:34,809
When you go into a casino any money that is in your pocket

2383
03:46:35,850 --> 03:46:44,200
Is not coming back with you. That's how you should look at it. You are there to entertain yourself and maybe a group of friends

2384
03:46:45,610 --> 03:46:48,569
That's it

2385
03:46:48,569 --> 03:46:52,010
Whatever is in your pocket. You should assume right off the bat is not going to come home

2386
03:46:53,040 --> 03:47:01,799
At all. This is where the big plays happen right here. That's 18 bingo right off the bat done

2387
03:47:02,120 --> 03:47:04,940
Got it

2388
03:47:06,459 --> 03:47:07,659
There it is

2389
03:47:07,659 --> 03:47:12,940
This is where it begins

2390
03:47:12,940 --> 03:47:18,059
If you suck

2391
03:47:18,059 --> 03:47:21,129
Hey shit, come on

2392
03:47:22,059 --> 03:47:23,899
No hit again

2393
03:47:23,899 --> 03:47:26,700
Oh, fuck you video game. I have to I have to hit again

2394
03:47:27,340 --> 03:47:29,819
Oh, I have to I have to right after

2395
03:47:30,459 --> 03:47:37,629
I never stand on I should hit I should this is why you can't stand on 16 versus 10

2396
03:47:38,680 --> 03:47:40,920
I know this i'm a professional card player

2397
03:47:50,620 --> 03:47:52,989
god

2398
03:47:54,829 --> 03:48:06,670
Why ace finally some fucking wins

2399
03:48:10,520 --> 03:48:19,530
This guy's not even trying to hide his cheating what do you mean hide?

2400
03:48:20,329 --> 03:48:22,889
Don't do anything to stay. He's gonna bust and i'm gonna make money

2401
03:48:24,010 --> 03:48:25,920
Don't do anything

2402
03:48:25,920 --> 03:48:26,879
Hold you

2403
03:48:26,879 --> 03:48:28,879
This game is this this is that?

2404
03:48:29,959 --> 03:48:31,959
Yeah, someone's cheating. I feel the same way

2405
03:48:36,940 --> 03:48:43,020
What is this?

2406
03:48:43,579 --> 03:48:45,879
Oh my god

2407
03:48:47,639 --> 03:48:50,360
Can I go back and get more money from the guy at the cashier?

2408
03:48:54,459 --> 03:48:57,739
Are you having fun?

2409
03:48:57,739 --> 03:48:59,739
Kind of because this is not real

2410
03:48:59,979 --> 03:49:03,100
And it's I guess it'd be kind of could be fun if it's not real

2411
03:49:04,239 --> 03:49:07,440
And yanners just came in with a rate of like 75 million people

2412
03:49:09,159 --> 03:49:11,819
Seventy two hundred people just came in from yanners

2413
03:49:12,540 --> 03:49:17,280
What's going on yanners? Thanks for the raid

Hope you had a good stream of yanners

2421
03:49:43,610 --> 03:49:47,389

2444
03:52:48,700 --> 03:52:51,309

All right, so I just double down

2453
03:53:26,219 --> 03:53:28,219
Even though it's a 10 who cares? Let's go

Everyone's having such a good time. This is all fake pumped in cheering

03:56:15,799 --> 03:56:17,879
I don't it's not possible to win on a three

2487
03:56:18,600 --> 03:56:20,299
slot machine

2488
03:56:20,299 --> 03:56:26,190
Thanks for almost proving me wrong. That would have been great. Come on

2489
03:56:29,079 --> 03:56:30,920
Bah bah bah

2490
03:56:30,920 --> 03:56:39,000
What happened what just happened? What happened?

2491
03:56:40,010 --> 03:56:42,719
What happened?

2492
03:56:42,719 --> 03:56:44,840
What what did I just do?

2493
03:56:44,840 --> 03:56:57,280
Oh my god, seven thousand dollars. I have seven thousand dollars

2494
03:56:58,360 --> 03:57:01,049
Oh my god, it worked

2495
03:57:01,049 --> 03:57:03,129
Pay back your debt. No what I don't need to

2496
03:57:04,059 --> 03:57:05,340
I don't do that yet

2497
03:57:05,340 --> 03:57:11,229
I didn't pay back my loan

2498
03:57:11,799 --> 03:57:16,030
Wait, do I have to

2499
03:57:16,510 --> 03:57:24,489
This walk

2500
03:57:24,489 --> 03:57:26,489
They're all cheering for me

2501
03:57:26,649 --> 03:57:30,750
You want to return a marker? Yes

2502
03:57:30,909 --> 03:57:34,299
Return a marker. Yes

2503
03:57:34,540 --> 03:57:37,180
Oh what I only have 1900 bucks. That sucks

2504
03:57:37,899 --> 03:57:48,719
All right. We're taking it. We're taking it right

2505
03:57:49,870 --> 03:57:52,590
Taking the winnings right over to burger gym

2506
03:57:57,600 --> 03:58:00,079
Come on burger gym. Let's go. I paid back all my debt

2507
03:58:00,639 --> 03:58:08,540
This is all profit right here. You play normal games. No, I don't

2508
03:58:12,350 --> 03:58:14,729
five dollars

2509
03:58:14,729 --> 03:58:15,930
Load it up

2510
03:58:15,930 --> 03:58:18,510
Okay

2511
03:58:18,510 --> 03:58:21,870
Nine lines, let's go for it that max

2512
03:58:24,760 --> 03:58:26,219
That's something

2513
03:58:26,219 --> 03:58:31,530
That's something

2514
03:58:31,530 --> 03:58:34,760
That's big

2515
03:58:34,760 --> 03:58:37,450
That's big. That's huge

2516
03:58:39,819 --> 03:58:41,819
That's like 25 grand

2517
03:58:42,829 --> 03:58:44,190
Yeah, what?

2518
03:58:44,190 --> 03:58:57,770
What are you talking about? Oh, it's five dollars

2519
03:58:58,489 --> 03:59:12,409
Catch up. Nice

2520
03:59:12,409 --> 03:59:16,000

Catch up. All right, get out get out get out. I'm good. I got three thousand. I'm good

2522
03:59:22,809 --> 03:59:28,670
Please stop you've been playing this for more than half an hour

2523
03:59:30,170 --> 03:59:32,729
I I think I told you I was going to be here for like at least two hours

2524
03:59:33,209 --> 03:59:42,159
Before I put the disc in tell you telling me to stop playing the casino game in a half an hour. I

2525
03:59:42,799 --> 03:59:45,200
You could be new if you are new. Just remember

2526
03:59:45,920 --> 03:59:47,760
We always come out on top

2527
03:59:47,760 --> 03:59:50,270
always

2528
03:59:50,270 --> 03:59:54,430
Last time I had a slot machine in front of me. I went I went to 20 billion dollars in the chocolate game

2529
03:59:54,909 --> 03:59:56,750
Time before that. Mr. Green

2530
03:59:56,750 --> 04:00:00,350
Took walked away with 2.4 million. We always win always

2531
04:00:01,149 --> 04:00:06,000
Here's your silver vip card. This allows you to enter thousand dollar poker tournaments

2532
04:00:06,559 --> 04:00:10,239
It makes you eligible to receive the vacation tournament bonus prize

2533
04:00:10,879 --> 04:00:20,479
What should I do for a tournament?

2534
04:00:20,479 --> 04:00:31,680
Oh roll. I love roulette roulette's great because it's the slowest game in the casino

2535
04:00:34,040 --> 04:00:39,559
That you could bet ten dollars and it takes like four minutes five minutes to have whatever the outcome happens. It's very slow

2536
04:00:40,200 --> 04:00:45,079
The objective of the tournament is to be the player with the highest bank roll after the designated number of games

2537
04:00:45,719 --> 04:00:50,840
The winner receives four thousand dollars in the victory count stores winning a low level tournament bonus prize

2538
04:00:51,799 --> 04:00:53,610
All right

2539
04:00:53,610 --> 04:00:55,610
Let's go. All right set bet

2540
04:00:55,690 --> 04:00:57,450
I want to go

2541
04:00:57,450 --> 04:01:00,489
You always do right? You always do the the the right in the middle here

2542
04:01:01,129 --> 04:01:10,920
You got to get the inside the corners put put 50 bucks here

2543
04:01:11,639 --> 04:01:21,559
I'm going to go down here 50 bucks down here as well. This is it bingo. I'm ready. You always get the corners

2544
04:01:22,909 --> 04:01:24,670
I forget what numbers they were

2545
04:01:24,670 --> 04:01:28,000
It will in the 20s

2546
04:01:28,000 --> 04:01:32,350
There it is. That's it, right?

2547
04:01:33,000 --> 04:01:34,520
Oh shit

2548
04:01:34,520 --> 04:01:40,590
It's okay 30 spins

2549
04:01:42,139 --> 04:01:44,379
I'm keeping the same ones

2550
04:01:44,379 --> 04:01:46,620
Don't move another thing in roulette. Don't move

2551
04:01:51,950 --> 04:01:53,309
precisely why

2552
04:01:53,309 --> 04:01:56,030
I wasn't wait. Oh, i'm in 22 23 24

2553
04:01:58,670 --> 04:02:00,829
Don't move

2554
04:02:00,829 --> 04:02:03,790
32 33 35 36 20 we're looking for 30s

2555
04:02:11,709 --> 04:02:18,760
Don't move exactly. That's why you don't fucking move. That's not wait 32

2556
04:02:22,120 --> 04:02:29,549
Don't move just don't bet any money bet one dollar

2557
04:02:30,840 --> 04:02:32,120
Wait, could I?

2558
04:02:32,120 --> 04:02:35,659
There it is

2559
04:02:35,659 --> 04:02:37,979
What the fuck are you talking about? What?

2560
04:02:42,670 --> 04:02:45,549
Just don't bet I have to now i'm down 400

2561
04:02:46,670 --> 04:02:49,549
Don't move. It's gonna hit it just has to hit once and i'm up

2562
04:02:56,360 --> 04:03:00,510
Oh, fuck you

2563
04:03:00,510 --> 04:03:02,329
I'm not moving

2564
04:03:02,329 --> 04:03:09,180
Because the second I take it off, it's gonna hit one of these eight numbers. This guy's fucking incompetent

2565
04:03:09,659 --> 04:03:13,340
It's a game where you spin a marble around and random person wins

2566
04:03:15,680 --> 04:03:20,559
There is no skill in roulette. It's just throwing a dice in the air. What do you mean?

2567
04:03:26,090 --> 04:03:30,090
I mean, I know maybe you sit there and rub your belly before each spin, but that doesn't do anything

2568
04:03:30,729 --> 04:03:38,969
That's the one right there bingo

2569
04:03:47,600 --> 04:03:53,549
Do it 28

2570
04:04:01,290 --> 04:04:03,659
That's it

2571
04:04:03,659 --> 04:04:05,100
Why?

2572
04:04:05,100 --> 04:04:18,090
You gotta start looking for people that remember you

2573
04:04:22,799 --> 04:04:25,040
Look jeremy at the casino

2574
04:04:26,399 --> 04:04:28,399
I hope they remember you

2575
04:04:38,969 --> 04:04:40,969
Give me the minus two as I deserve it

2576
04:04:40,969 --> 04:04:59,309
Oh my god, what happens if you have no more money? Do I just leave the table? Don't move he says

2577
04:05:00,559 --> 04:05:02,559
That usually works. Look it hits like

2578
04:05:02,959 --> 04:05:04,959
Whatever. I won't do that again

2579
04:05:08,430 --> 04:05:15,420
Blackjack tournament, let's go. Why not just go to a real casino because this is not real money

2580
04:05:16,139 --> 04:05:18,030
This is just make-believe

2581
04:05:18,030 --> 04:05:22,670
You want me to go to a casino and just drop like five grand and just lose. I don't why would I do that?

2582
04:05:23,870 --> 04:05:25,870
All right highest bank roll

2583
04:05:25,950 --> 04:05:35,129
I need to win one hand here and then play one dollar a hand

2584
04:05:39,719 --> 04:05:43,799
Come on, I said to win one hand. All right, that's it. Now i'm gonna play one dollar for the rest of the game

2585
04:05:56,750 --> 04:05:59,280
One dollar I don't want to clean that

2586
04:06:00,399 --> 04:06:02,399
Okay, i'm gonna win the tournament now

2587
04:06:08,909 --> 04:06:13,579
This is four grand by the way

2588
04:06:13,579 --> 04:06:18,299
Honestly, you know, I gotta try I gotta try to screw over the person next to me. They're looking for what are they looking for?

2589
04:06:18,860 --> 04:06:21,420
I can play 45 hands

2590
04:06:22,219 --> 04:06:26,299
So if I take another card, I could just completely screw Evelyn over

2591
04:06:29,229 --> 04:06:32,590
But that's what you needed

2592
04:06:32,590 --> 04:06:37,709
Yeah, you lose I win

2593
04:06:37,709 --> 04:06:42,409
Again, uh people take a look around you go big first

2594
04:06:44,159 --> 04:06:47,280
I got blackjack with a dollar. It doesn't whatever I just have to survive

2595
04:06:50,799 --> 04:06:52,799
Kimberly's coming up here with a thousand two

2596
04:06:58,200 --> 04:07:00,200
You need to bet two dollars. No, I don't not yet

2597
04:07:04,270 --> 04:07:07,469
Where were these hands when I was playing 40 minutes ago?

2598
04:07:08,350 --> 04:07:14,969
Why?

2599
04:07:14,969 --> 04:07:16,969
Okay, i'm still in the lead

2600
04:07:26,190 --> 04:07:28,909
Oh, no, they're cowards. They're not gonna bet more than a dog. Wait

2601
04:07:29,709 --> 04:07:31,709
You double down over there. I hope she loses

2602
04:07:32,350 --> 04:07:37,739
Come on. Okay. It's all right

2603
04:07:37,739 --> 04:07:45,229
What's Kimberly doing three dollars?

2604
04:07:47,719 --> 04:07:49,719
Oh my god, what the fuck?

2605
04:07:52,860 --> 04:07:58,750
Yeah, there's a guy in the security window right now like mr. Green just currently betting one dollar instead of 250 dollars a hand

2606
04:08:00,120 --> 04:08:04,360
Yeah, just starting to let him win. So then he starts that something gets cocky and puts a hundred dollars on the table

2607
04:08:04,979 --> 04:08:11,540
assholes

2608
04:08:11,540 --> 04:08:13,879
1015 oh, that's she just bet five bucks

2609
04:08:16,270 --> 04:08:26,399
I still think she's gonna lose

2610
04:08:26,399 --> 04:08:32,969
But I took all the cards from her

2611
04:08:32,969 --> 04:08:36,090
By the way, the the profits are going right to burger gym. Hope you guys know that

2612
04:08:36,729 --> 04:08:40,700
Because i'm guaranteed to win this

2613
04:08:42,639 --> 04:08:44,639
21 shit, she's climbing

2614
04:08:45,690 --> 04:08:47,129
I don't like that

2615
04:08:47,129 --> 04:08:49,129
Is that 1018?

2616
04:08:49,450 --> 04:08:53,450
I think I might no I can't I have to just play the statistics that she's not gonna bet more

2617
04:08:55,440 --> 04:09:05,690
She's going four dollars now. Can I with like attrition here? Can I win this? Can I keep doing this?

2618
04:09:10,110 --> 04:09:12,059
I'm good

2619
04:09:12,059 --> 04:09:14,059
At two bucks. No, no way

2620
04:09:15,159 --> 04:09:17,159
I have 20 more hands of one dollar

2621
04:09:24,540 --> 04:09:26,540
Jerma read books or just chat

2622
04:09:27,100 --> 04:09:30,479
Probably just chat at this point

2623
04:09:30,479 --> 04:09:35,950
Hit again

2624
04:09:35,950 --> 04:09:38,250
Shit

2625
04:09:38,250 --> 04:09:40,250
Bet five. No, why would I bet five?

2626
04:09:41,319 --> 04:09:44,280
I don't have to increase my bet until kimberly gets up to

2627
04:09:45,469 --> 04:09:46,649
like

2628
04:09:46,649 --> 04:09:48,649
1030 1040

2629
04:09:53,020 --> 04:09:54,540
Why would I do that?

2630
04:09:54,540 --> 04:09:58,829
She's gonna lose and she did one dollar. She's trying to do the same thing. She's trying to bait me

2631
04:10:04,190 --> 04:10:07,149
Okay, all right, we know i'm the little we're almost halfway there

2632
04:10:10,940 --> 04:10:13,739
All right, how kimberly do let go five bucks lose it

2633
04:10:17,020 --> 04:10:17,979
She has

2634
04:10:18,040 --> 04:10:25,840
17 versus five fuck. Uh-oh

2635
04:10:27,469 --> 04:10:29,469
Slowly, she is closing the gap

2636
04:10:31,069 --> 04:10:34,590
At 250 to throw her off. No if I lose it's over

2637
04:10:39,659 --> 04:10:41,659
16 versus five she's got okay

2638
04:10:42,799 --> 04:10:44,799
Oh shit. Okay. She has 13

2639
04:10:45,840 --> 04:10:50,360
This is a hand all of us are gonna win. Oh shit. All right. I got what do I do?

2640
04:10:51,479 --> 04:10:53,159
I have to bet 10 bucks

2641
04:10:53,159 --> 04:10:57,899
What do I do? She's climbing. No, I don't have to do that yet. Stick with the strategy

2642
04:11:00,190 --> 04:11:02,190
I have to stay with the strategy. I'll be fine

2643
04:11:07,340 --> 04:11:11,020
Sorry, I gained a little bit of ground there. She lost two. I lost one

2644
04:11:11,659 --> 04:11:28,940
Bet all your money to throw off her rhythm. Oh, I don't have to do it yet

2645
04:11:29,500 --> 04:11:34,750
Go back to sneak jim

2646
04:11:35,500 --> 04:11:37,500
Are you combining two games you've seen today?

2647
04:11:39,600 --> 04:11:41,520
That was a four dollar bet

2648
04:11:41,520 --> 04:11:43,200
Oh, she's in trouble

2649
04:11:43,200 --> 04:11:45,200
She's gonna lose that four dollar bet

2650
04:11:47,659 --> 04:11:49,209
Hey

2651
04:11:49,209 --> 04:11:50,809
Yes. All right. We're good

2652
04:11:50,809 --> 04:11:57,850
If you win an all-in you're gonna win the tournament

2653
04:11:58,489 --> 04:11:58,649
Yeah

2654
04:11:58,649 --> 04:12:03,129
But if I just slowly burn one dollar a hand and she slowly burns like two dollars every other hand

2655
04:12:03,129 --> 04:12:04,250
I'm gonna win

2656
04:12:04,250 --> 04:12:07,280
She's gonna lose right there

2657
04:12:07,280 --> 04:12:09,120
Yeah, she she's fucked

2658
04:12:09,120 --> 04:12:12,590
That's four dollar lose. Oh, it's all right. Whatever

2659
04:12:13,469 --> 04:12:21,610
Can you please at least try to play as mr. Green's mr. Green has?

2660
04:12:22,229 --> 04:12:24,489
A hundred thousand dollars at least on the table

2661
04:12:25,209 --> 04:12:26,649
I'm not there yet

2662
04:12:26,649 --> 04:12:32,639
Shit. All right. Everybody lost

2663
04:12:32,639 --> 04:12:42,299
only like 11 hands

2664
04:12:42,299 --> 04:12:45,500
This should be a minimum bet because being able to do one dollar

2665
04:12:45,500 --> 04:12:48,219
I just bet 50 bucks the first hand and i'm just gonna coast to victory

2666
04:12:52,120 --> 04:12:53,879
Yeah, that's sealed right there I think

2667
04:12:53,879 --> 04:13:01,760
At 50 now. No

2668
04:13:03,100 --> 04:13:05,340
I don't have to bet 50 dollars. There's no reason to

2669
04:13:15,389 --> 04:13:18,030
That's fine. All right. Here we go. This is a lot to win

2670
04:13:19,129 --> 04:13:21,680
$4,000

2671
04:13:21,680 --> 04:13:24,559
Do a 150 dollar hand right now or i'm gonna resident sleeper

2672
04:13:26,399 --> 04:13:27,840
Go for it. I don't care

2673
04:13:27,840 --> 04:13:31,020
I'm not losing this tournament. I've been here for so long

2674
04:13:34,670 --> 04:13:38,190
No, i'm about to win four thousand dollars then I take that to burger gym

2675
04:13:40,430 --> 04:13:42,430
And we're gonna do huge bets

2676
04:13:46,809 --> 04:13:48,809
We're fine. All right, it's it's sealed

2677
04:13:49,049 --> 04:13:51,610
As long as she doesn't win like another five or ten dollar hand

2678
04:13:58,069 --> 04:14:04,319
standing

2679
04:14:04,319 --> 04:14:06,489
Okay, only six more hands

2680
04:14:09,690 --> 04:14:14,750
Playing smart is pog. Don't listen to them. I have blown more fake money on this stream

2681
04:14:15,469 --> 04:14:18,110
Doing dumb things like that, but it's a guaranteed victory

2682
04:14:18,829 --> 04:14:26,700
i'm taking the sure thing

2683
04:14:26,700 --> 04:14:29,500
I feel like michelle's gonna turn to me take the glasses off and go like

2684
04:14:31,399 --> 04:14:39,209
Like a big tongue's gonna come out let's split these let's split fives for fun

2685
04:14:47,290 --> 04:14:49,290
Yeah, two dollars

2686
04:14:51,770 --> 04:14:53,770
Michelle's uh getting desperate

2687
04:14:53,770 --> 04:15:01,879
That was eight bucks

2688
04:15:01,879 --> 04:15:06,360
13 versus four don't do anything dude. Stay there. Don't do anything. Don't fucking just get your hands off the table

2692
04:15:19,559 --> 04:15:31,799

You won the thousand dollar blackjack tournament to win the counselor as a bonus prize. You must play and win another tournament to win the prize

2706
04:16:58,190 --> 04:17:09,290
That was for a thousand dollars. I thought that was four thousand. Wasn't it four thousand?

2717
04:18:00,270 --> 04:18:10,239

04:18:10,239 --> 04:18:16,200

I'm up. Well, i'm way up. I'm fine

2722
04:18:38,170 --> 04:18:42,569
You got to do something crazy if you're way up just a little bit and then here we go like for instance

2723
04:18:44,159 --> 04:18:54,780
Back to burger gym. Hold on. What did I win? I just get like a

2724
04:18:55,739 --> 04:19:03,479
Sympathy money. What was that for?

2725
04:19:03,559 --> 04:19:04,440

I think okay. I stand alive

2728
04:19:13,719 --> 04:19:20,559
You're a low iq slot streamer if you play slots your low iq

2729
04:19:28,270 --> 04:19:30,270
Shit, hold on. Wait

2730
04:19:30,750 --> 04:19:46,920

Low iq slots river

2733
04:19:55,979 --> 04:19:59,899
What do you mean low iq it takes that much more iq to fucking

2734
04:20:00,700 --> 04:20:10,700
Sit at a roulette table

2735
04:20:10,700 --> 04:20:14,670
Come on do something

2736
04:20:14,670 --> 04:20:16,350
Oh

2737
04:20:16,350 --> 04:20:18,430
My god, that would have been insane

2738
04:20:19,149 --> 04:20:23,100
Let this be a lesson. Don't ever go to the casino. Go you you know

2739
04:20:23,100 --> 04:20:25,260
Go to i'm not gonna tell you not to go to the casino, right?

2740
04:20:26,059 --> 04:20:29,180
If you want to go to the casino and just spend some money to hang out with your friends, that's fine

2741
04:20:29,420 --> 04:20:32,379
But like this shit is just you're gonna lose money in the long term always

2742
04:20:33,100 --> 04:20:37,819
You're never gonna win a substantial amount of money and doesn't matter how many people they put as a cardboard cutout

2743
04:20:38,139 --> 04:20:40,379
Holding like a fucking eleven hundred dollar check

2744
04:20:41,440 --> 04:20:46,319
Look how much carol wine at the slot that that's not that's not that's not gonna do anything

2745
04:20:46,799 --> 04:20:48,319
You're not gonna win that

2746
04:20:48,319 --> 04:20:57,260
You're gonna sit here like I am you're gonna burn through a thousand dollars and you're not gonna be the person with a check in their hand

2747
04:20:59,549 --> 04:21:11,020
It's a lesson

2748
04:21:11,020 --> 04:21:18,409
But my grandmother won i'm a net positive from casinos

2749
04:21:20,000 --> 04:21:21,899
That's really good

2750
04:21:21,899 --> 04:21:23,340
Try to keep it that way

2751
04:21:23,340 --> 04:21:30,319
We just need another big hit so I can go back to burger gym

2752
04:21:36,139 --> 04:21:38,139
2k not 1k

2753
04:21:38,299 --> 04:21:40,299
And what you fixed it

2754
04:21:40,860 --> 04:21:42,540
My point still stands

2755
04:21:42,540 --> 04:21:45,040

2816
04:28:08,670 --> 04:28:11,870
All right, we're gonna do 35 because that's how old I am

2817
04:28:12,350 --> 04:28:18,750
And this is how old i'm gonna be

2818
04:28:19,149 --> 04:28:29,610
this year

2819
04:28:29,610 --> 04:28:51,180
It won. All right. There's one. There's another one. There's i'm getting one credit for this

2820
04:28:57,440 --> 04:29:03,180
This sucks

2821
04:29:03,180 --> 04:29:05,180
one credit for each

2822
04:29:05,260 --> 04:29:13,659
You gotta do at least three. All right, we're gonna do all the corners

2823
04:29:17,719 --> 04:29:21,440
right in the middle and then

2824
04:29:22,280 --> 04:29:41,709
These two and these two all right go. All right, that's

2825
04:29:42,190 --> 04:29:56,440
I don't understand why that what's happening too much. I would rather play burger gym and

2826
04:29:57,079 --> 04:30:09,879
Cry he's playing this to the stream ends. That's not true. I'm just enjoying myself. All right. There we go

2827
04:30:10,280 --> 04:30:13,659
Come on, give me like a four. All right

2828
04:30:15,280 --> 04:30:17,280
Okay, I mean that's horrible

2829
04:30:17,440 --> 04:30:34,010
How would you ever play this game? Nobody enjoys themselves at a casino stop lying. That's not true if you win like five thousand dollars

2830
04:30:34,729 --> 04:30:42,250
And then you take a hundred dollars out and you play one dollar bets everywhere you leave with four thousand nine hundred and ninety dollars

2831
04:30:43,370 --> 04:31:00,120
Free car poker sucks, but i'm gonna play it. Please play the playstation connect wizard game to this. I would prefer that too

2832
04:31:04,760 --> 04:31:06,100
All right, let's do

2833
04:31:06,100 --> 04:31:07,879
25 in the ante

2834
04:31:07,879 --> 04:31:12,680
Let's go ahead and make the best handicap with three cards

2835
04:31:13,399 --> 04:31:19,100
Looking for a flush

2836
04:31:19,100 --> 04:31:25,930
I'm gonna bet on this one. There it is. All right, not bad. It's I got the high card

2837
04:31:26,649 --> 04:31:29,530
You guys don't understand how this works

2838
04:31:29,530 --> 04:31:35,690
I have king so I get the high card. I win everyone plays against the dealer. I hate this game, but i'm gonna play it

2839
04:31:36,700 --> 04:31:39,340
If I do if I put money on pair plus by the way

2840
04:31:41,500 --> 04:31:45,420
If I put money on pair plus if I get a pair or above that

2841
04:31:46,969 --> 04:31:50,170
I make a little bit of money a lot of money. Actually, let's go for a big one

2842
04:31:50,809 --> 04:32:05,180
Give me a pair. It's not a pair. I'm out. I have to fold if this hand sucks

2843
04:32:05,819 --> 04:32:15,690
And I would have lost

2844
04:32:15,690 --> 04:32:17,209
You're a moron

2845
04:32:17,209 --> 04:32:23,129
He's playing pair plus omega lol. I know it's a sucker bet, but whatever sometimes suckers win a lot of money

2846
04:32:28,809 --> 04:32:31,069
shit

2847
04:32:31,069 --> 04:32:33,229
Xbox sucks. The xbox is one of the best systems

2848
04:32:35,629 --> 04:32:39,209
oh

2849
04:32:39,209 --> 04:32:47,040
Three cards suck go all in I just gotta get one decent uh pair plus hand. It's not a pair plus

2850
04:32:49,020 --> 04:32:52,299
But i'm gonna play because I have a king and it's just a high card

2851
04:32:53,100 --> 04:32:59,260
Yep

2852
04:32:59,260 --> 04:33:01,559
This time we're gonna go even higher

2853
04:33:01,559 --> 04:33:03,799
What do you think? All right, i'm looking for a big pair plus

2854
04:33:04,439 --> 04:33:06,520
Wow, that's bad stupid idea

2855
04:33:07,159 --> 04:33:12,509
I'll do 70 bucks. Let's go pairs

2856
04:33:13,389 --> 04:33:16,439
Give me a pair

2857
04:33:16,439 --> 04:33:21,200
uh

2858
04:33:21,200 --> 04:33:23,200
I have to have to yeah, i'm gonna stay in

2859
04:33:25,880 --> 04:33:27,880
All right. I'm all right. I only lost 45 dollars

2860
04:33:28,439 --> 04:33:33,000
Get more omega low. I this is all I got i'm not going back to the stupid cashier

2861
04:33:36,860 --> 04:33:37,900
pair

2862
04:33:37,900 --> 04:33:43,229
What I lost

2863
04:33:43,229 --> 04:33:52,919
Then I said be funny ban that person for life

2864
04:33:53,880 --> 04:34:05,689
permanently

2865
04:34:05,689 --> 04:34:06,729
Damn it

2866
04:34:06,729 --> 04:34:08,729
I would have that would have been a flush

2867
04:34:10,939 --> 04:34:20,319
All right, just it's a queen. I get a lee i'm only leasing whatever give me something better than a pair

2868
04:34:22,270 --> 04:34:27,389
Give me something better than this so I can prove to everybody here that this is like not a sucker's bet every single time

2869
04:34:28,029 --> 04:34:31,229
See, why do you get the pairs?

2870
04:34:31,229 --> 04:34:40,509
For a second. I thought that said I was broke

2871
04:34:40,750 --> 04:34:48,750
But that person's name is brook old again air plus low iq. That's fine. But

2872
04:34:49,470 --> 04:34:54,189
Somebody's gonna come over to this table. They're gonna put 100 on pair plus and they're gonna win 15 000

2873
04:34:56,000 --> 04:34:58,000

120 that's nothing. That's that's uh, this is a sucker's bet

2877
04:35:18,279 --> 04:35:19,880
It's only two to one

2878
04:35:19,880 --> 04:35:21,400
Well, that was bad

2879
04:35:21,400 --> 04:35:30,669
It is a sucker's bet

2880
04:35:32,110 --> 04:35:34,729
Yeah, let's show you a sucker

2881
04:35:39,520 --> 04:35:49,180
How's that for a fucking sucker bet? Oh, I thought it was gonna be a straight. I thought it was gonna be a straight

2882
04:35:52,939 --> 04:35:56,560
Do it again

2883
04:35:56,560 --> 04:35:59,279
Come on. This is the i'm then i'm gonna leave it. I'm gonna play a different game

2884
04:36:02,810 --> 04:36:22,200
Oh my god. Sorry

2885
04:36:32,240 --> 04:36:34,240
My brain's turning into soup

2886
04:36:34,240 --> 04:36:39,419
Well, go get some crackers

2887
04:36:39,419 --> 04:37:02,650
I exit the game what just happened. He's trying to exit the table. Why do I have a thousand dollars?

2888
04:37:14,299 --> 04:37:16,459
Oh, I didn't save the game in like an hour and a half

2889
04:37:24,889 --> 04:37:28,060
Oops

2890
04:37:28,060 --> 04:37:30,700
Oh, we got that big. Hey, remember we got that big hit from

2891
04:37:31,340 --> 04:37:32,380
uh

2892
04:37:32,380 --> 04:37:34,299
chicago

2893
04:37:34,299 --> 04:37:43,930
Royale whatever it is

2894
04:37:43,930 --> 04:37:53,689
No value. Okay. I'm just gonna play like five dollar hands and then go into the pair plus and put as much as I can

2895
04:37:54,250 --> 04:38:14,720
Play this all night. I don't think I want to I don't want to play this all night

2896
04:38:14,720 --> 04:38:17,439
This game is not as fun as like vegas steaks was

2897
04:38:18,000 --> 04:38:30,439
It's not a pair plus

2898
04:38:30,439 --> 04:38:33,580
I'm gonna throw up because of this

2899
04:38:34,459 --> 04:38:37,099
Why did I not play that hand? I would have won at least five dollars back

2900
04:38:37,180 --> 04:38:40,380
Does it really matter if I want to win five dollars back at this point? Not really

2901
04:38:49,279 --> 04:39:11,400
All right. I'm getting a new game. We're gonna play into the game here. It's been two hours. Yeah, I had fun. It's been fun

2902
04:39:14,799 --> 04:39:16,560
You had a flush what?

2903
04:39:16,560 --> 04:39:20,840
Wait, I had a I actually had a flush

2904
04:39:22,110 --> 04:39:27,869
Wait, that would have been probably like three or four thousand dollars at least if I would have been like 10 grand. Really?

2905
04:39:29,450 --> 04:39:39,790
I had the flush

2906
04:39:39,790 --> 04:39:47,229
I wasn't even paying attention you streamed this for two hours. I don't think it was that long

2907
04:39:56,479 --> 04:40:10,810
It was not that long it was not burger gym is back. This is exhausting

2908
04:40:13,720 --> 04:40:15,560
We're not like doing sit-ups

2909
04:40:15,560 --> 04:40:17,560
I'm just playing in the casino game

2910
04:40:38,939 --> 04:40:40,540
Oh, there it is

2911
04:40:40,540 --> 04:40:51,790
There it is

2912
04:40:51,790 --> 04:40:54,349
Burger gym for three hours. No, i'm done after this

2913
04:40:56,240 --> 04:41:01,560
All right, that's it. What this is the last spin and then that's it and then one more after that

2914
04:41:07,880 --> 04:41:11,689
All right next game

2915
04:41:11,689 --> 04:41:19,759
God damn it. All right. I'm gonna pee i'll come back. We'll play another game

2916
04:41:21,180 --> 04:41:22,970
xbox

2917
04:41:22,970 --> 04:41:26,650
Night continues

2918
04:41:26,650 --> 04:43:36,330
We're back. Okay. This is another game that i'm not sure

2919
04:43:37,549 --> 04:43:41,310
How good this is gonna be but I saw the I kind of just saw the title

2920
04:43:42,810 --> 04:43:46,409
And I had to try it. I had to play it. I had to buy it

2921
04:43:48,590 --> 04:43:50,669
And that game what i'm referring to obviously

2922
04:43:51,630 --> 04:43:54,909
Is dyno topia the sunstone odyssey for xbox?

2923
04:43:55,630 --> 04:44:10,159
I wonder uh, let's see how this is

2924
04:44:11,849 --> 04:44:14,970
Dino topia, let's say safely. Look at it. It looks a little

2925
04:44:15,770 --> 04:44:17,849
A little broken in the middle there, but that's okay

2926
04:44:19,020 --> 04:44:21,020
apprentice master

2927
04:44:21,020 --> 04:44:28,360
apprentice

2928
04:44:28,360 --> 04:44:30,119
I know doi doi doi

2929
04:44:30,119 --> 04:44:34,330
I had a vhs of this show. Wait, this is a tv show

2930
04:44:35,130 --> 04:44:46,889
Holy shit

2931
04:44:47,369 --> 04:44:49,610
Hold on. Wait a second. Did that just go?

2932
04:45:04,220 --> 04:45:05,580
Billy west

2933
04:45:05,580 --> 04:45:15,080
That t-rex I swear to god that was like

2934
04:45:16,990 --> 04:45:18,590
I need to hear a clip of that

2935
04:45:18,590 --> 04:45:21,020
I'm not in control of the character

2936
04:45:21,020 --> 04:45:29,560
What was the point of showing that they couldn't just say get up. We gotta go

2937
04:45:33,950 --> 04:45:38,479
They show that

2938
04:45:38,479 --> 04:45:40,479
Here it is. Let's go inside

2939
04:45:41,919 --> 04:45:43,520
Follow your brother

2940
04:45:43,520 --> 04:45:44,639
jacob

2941
04:45:44,639 --> 04:45:47,130
Move in the direction you wish to go

2942
04:45:47,450 --> 04:45:49,290
Press b to jump

2943
04:45:49,290 --> 04:45:56,759
Okay, do I have attacks?

2944
04:45:56,759 --> 04:46:00,599
Ah, the gemini twins have been expecting you

2945
04:46:01,159 --> 04:46:08,119
Drake this is castor bollocks. He was a friend of dad's he taught me how to fight and I brought you here

2946
04:46:08,360 --> 04:46:14,599
So he can teach you the stick. It's good to meet you. Mr. Pollock's. I was so sad to hear about your father

2947
04:46:15,549 --> 04:46:19,790
Jonas was a good friend of mine. It's shrek. Thanks for your concern. Mr. Pollock

2948
04:46:19,790 --> 04:46:25,470
This stupid island's been nothing but trouble since we were how are we gonna find a t-rex with a broomstick?

2949
04:46:26,029 --> 04:46:28,330
It doesn't seem very good

2950
04:46:30,169 --> 04:46:34,409
Just because some blind dinosaur lets him ride around on her

2951
04:46:35,319 --> 04:46:39,479
You know, he was doing her a favor as much as she was doing for him

2952
04:46:40,200 --> 04:46:44,459
And then he felt like we owed dinotopia some big debt of gratitude

2953
04:46:45,720 --> 04:46:48,680
I'm not buying it. You know, there's more to it than that

2954
04:46:49,240 --> 04:46:51,240
Everything is happening so fast. Yeah

2955
04:46:58,759 --> 04:47:04,439
It's hard for her 24th birthday with the root that keeps these dinotopians alive for so long

2956
04:47:05,000 --> 04:47:07,000
He shouldn't have been out there by himself

2957
04:47:07,159 --> 04:47:10,520
But it was just an unfortunate accident looks like a typewriter

2958
04:47:11,240 --> 04:47:17,240
That has fucked up teeth whatever they're called. Sorry. It's my dad. That's no accident

2959
04:47:17,880 --> 04:47:21,720
Is what is he saying? He wants a dinosaur is gonna be tried for murder

2960
04:47:22,759 --> 04:47:29,000
You may have animals to defend dinotopia not to destroy it. Whatever i'll do what I want

2961
04:47:29,880 --> 04:47:32,360
I'll do it. Wait, i'll do it. I won't

2962
04:47:33,000 --> 04:47:44,279
Agree to train you because you've just faced a very traumatic event in your dinosaurs committed to murder

2963
04:47:45,000 --> 04:47:49,389
I hope they talk god. I hope they talk to teach you. This is why I ask you

2964
04:47:49,869 --> 04:47:55,439
Please be cautious with the skills that I teach i've already gone over most of this with jacob

2965
04:47:56,240 --> 04:48:02,240
So let's get my favorite tv show jacob and drake drake and jacob staff of yours

2966
04:48:02,560 --> 04:48:07,720
I'm also giving you a sunstone counterweight to place on the other end of your staff

2967
04:48:09,400 --> 04:48:13,400
This particular mallet head come on that was at least a plus on one very strong

2968
04:48:13,639 --> 04:48:20,490
But three sages who live throughout dinotopia who are former guardians of the island

2969
04:48:20,729 --> 04:48:24,330
They are far too old now to defend much of anything

2970
04:48:25,209 --> 04:48:27,209
If you ever meet any of them

2971
04:48:27,529 --> 04:48:31,049
I'm sure with some persuasion they'd give you other mallet heads

2972
04:48:31,770 --> 04:48:38,569
Who may find other smaller sons drake and for sand jacob? Yeah, that's right sunstones when placed into a mallet

2973
04:48:41,529 --> 04:48:46,250
Each collected sunstone will add to a pool of energy displayed in the upper left corner with the blue bar

2974
04:48:46,889 --> 04:48:50,409
This sunstone energy can be used for sunstone powers when you receive them

2975
04:48:51,130 --> 04:48:59,560
It is important that you are always aware of threats around you move in the direction you want to orient the camera

2976
04:49:00,279 --> 04:49:05,080
Press to reorient camera first. What is that a chocolate chip? What is that?

2977
04:49:05,959 --> 04:49:10,759
Let us go over a few basic attacks approach the training dummy and attack it

2978
04:49:12,650 --> 04:49:14,650
What's with that neck?

2979
04:49:16,569 --> 04:49:25,599
The super nerd neck that's it

2980
04:49:32,220 --> 04:49:34,220
Can't wait to beat the dinosaurs with this move

2981
04:49:42,590 --> 04:49:48,110
Okay, interact. Hey, thanks for teaching me. You didn't teach me anything if you target an enemy before you attack

2982
04:49:49,130 --> 04:49:53,610
Focus your movements on that. He made a training dummy and just said hey just do whatever you want to

2983
04:49:54,169 --> 04:49:55,849
Swing at it, I guess

2984
04:49:55,849 --> 04:49:59,560
This is not you're not teaching me anything

2985
04:50:01,450 --> 04:50:03,689
Hold to select closest next target

2986
04:50:06,700 --> 04:50:12,250
Hold to untarget return. Wait, hold on

2987
04:50:13,310 --> 04:50:15,310
You touch it and it targets

2988
04:50:15,630 --> 04:50:18,189
Hold to un okay. You tap it to go to another target

2989
04:50:18,830 --> 04:50:20,509
Hold to untarget

2990
04:50:20,509 --> 04:50:26,750
Okay, I got it. Hold down target a dummy and throw a hobby pepper

2991
04:50:32,029 --> 04:50:33,720
What?

2992
04:50:33,720 --> 04:50:35,959
He didn't even teach me that i'm learning on my own

2993
04:50:41,209 --> 04:50:46,040
Be careful when you use hobby peppers

2994
04:50:46,439 --> 04:50:52,000
Usually they'll blind an opponent though. Sometimes all they'll do is make them angry

2995
04:50:52,560 --> 04:50:57,360
The dino topia mini series is free and legal to watch on youtube right now. I do not believe that I

2996
04:50:58,000 --> 04:51:02,159
Just because something is free does not mean I have the rights to broadcast it

2997
04:51:03,520 --> 04:51:10,759
Acts will grow stronger who receive instructions for other attacks from messenger birds. I send out

2998
04:51:15,419 --> 04:51:20,540
Let's go. I've got to get going now zane and the other outsiders are waiting for me

2999
04:51:21,020 --> 04:51:24,540
Are you sure I can't persuade you to join that robin atkins downs?

3000
04:51:25,979 --> 04:51:27,580
I think it is

3001
04:51:27,580 --> 04:51:29,580
It is it is it is

3002
04:51:30,380 --> 04:51:35,790
Is it no way you noodle head get the same things. That's him. It's him. It's him

3003
04:51:39,549 --> 04:51:44,830
I still think it's a mistake for you to run off and join those thugs. Well, I am that's him

3004
04:51:44,990 --> 04:51:47,470
And if I were you I'd be careful

3005
04:51:47,709 --> 04:51:53,790
The outsiders might just have something planned that's coming your way. I think that after I think that actually is him

3006
04:51:56,669 --> 04:52:03,790
Is it listen drake be careful things could get hairy these are some pretty ruthless guys, let's see

3007
04:52:04,270 --> 04:52:06,189
I think it's him

3008
04:52:06,189 --> 04:52:09,580
Thanks for your concern video games. I can take care of myself

3009
04:52:10,220 --> 04:52:13,659
You should be careful too though. Is it him? I don't trust those ones come up

3010
04:52:14,299 --> 04:52:20,299
We might not see eye to eye on this dyno topia my brother when it's gone still care about you thanks

3011
04:52:20,779 --> 04:52:26,939
Goodbye. Well, thanks for your help. Mr. Pollock's. I should probably get going too. Oh welcome drake

3012
04:52:27,979 --> 04:52:33,659
I need to find that. This is him look up miss oxbridge. She is a wise old dyno topia

3013
04:52:33,740 --> 04:52:35,740
I think may have another

3014
04:52:36,860 --> 04:52:42,779
Bollock use your help with one last thing. I know topia. Where is it? He's placed my favorite glass

3015
04:52:43,020 --> 04:52:46,779
What the fuck it's not him in the cave if you find them for me

3016
04:52:47,259 --> 04:52:52,700
I will give you some hobie peppers to take with you. I understand if you need to get going though

3017
04:52:53,259 --> 04:52:55,099

3018
04:52:55,099 --> 04:52:57,740
Pastor pollock's has lost his marbles help him find them what?

3019
04:52:58,540 --> 04:53:01,740
The hell is that you did that?

3020
04:53:06,959 --> 04:53:17,310
Okay, what the hell do I have to do?

3021
04:53:17,310 --> 04:53:19,310
I forget what am I doing kill the bird?

3022
04:53:19,709 --> 04:53:34,810
I'm trying I promise

3023
04:53:40,000 --> 04:53:42,000
He lost his marbles like in his house

3024
04:53:52,009 --> 04:53:54,169
Find miss oxbridge at the town center

3025
04:53:54,970 --> 04:53:56,970
Find the glass rocks

3026
04:54:02,349 --> 04:54:06,400
What?

3027
04:54:06,400 --> 04:54:10,599
Okay, wait while targeted pulled to dodge in a direction

3028
04:54:11,319 --> 04:54:15,000
Hold x to block. What is this? Why is there why is there a dinosaur in his house?

3029
04:54:28,240 --> 04:54:31,500
This is actually kind of cool. I like this

3030
04:54:31,500 --> 04:54:33,099
I get experience for that

3031
04:54:33,099 --> 04:54:36,909
This game's kind of fun. I like it. I can't wait to fight a t-rex

3032
04:54:46,319 --> 04:54:49,930
Stop hurting him. Is this his pet or something?

3033
04:54:50,490 --> 04:54:55,159
I have no idea where i'm supposed to go

3034
04:54:55,159 --> 04:55:04,639
I'm just gonna go back down go to the town center. This looks like um, what looks like this big darn asses

3035
04:55:05,279 --> 04:55:09,689
It was mr. Bollocks's dog

3036
04:55:09,689 --> 04:55:16,990
All right, i'm gonna leave

3037
04:55:16,990 --> 04:55:18,759
Let's go to the town center

3038
04:55:18,759 --> 04:55:27,279
You've not completed all quests on this level

3039
04:55:30,200 --> 04:55:32,200
What the fuck are you talking about? What?

3040
04:55:43,689 --> 04:55:45,689
Where's this guy's marbles?

3041
04:55:50,169 --> 04:56:01,419
Find his marbles

3042
04:56:01,419 --> 04:56:05,500
Is there sprint?

3043
04:56:05,500 --> 04:56:07,500
Are they in a chest or something?

3044
04:56:07,740 --> 04:56:12,599
You can leave without doing the quests. Can I?

3045
04:56:13,240 --> 04:56:19,259
Holy shit, that was a huge jump

3046
04:56:23,439 --> 04:56:26,479
I know it's a figure of speech, but why would it want me to stay here?

3047
04:56:27,040 --> 04:56:37,599
Nobody played this game. Nobody knows

3048
04:56:38,319 --> 04:56:50,299
Okay

3049
04:56:50,299 --> 04:56:56,000
Now what?

3050
04:56:56,000 --> 04:57:00,029
I'm miss oxbridge

3051
04:57:00,029 --> 04:57:02,349
Are these bad? Wait, are these bad? Are these?

3052
04:57:02,990 --> 04:57:07,000
Dinosaurs talk?

3053
04:57:07,000 --> 04:57:07,959
What?

3054
04:57:07,959 --> 04:57:16,169
That t-rex what that t-rex did go

3055
04:57:20,560 --> 04:57:22,560
I knew something was weird about the way he roared

3056
04:57:27,240 --> 04:57:32,119
Hi there. I wonder if you could help out a fellow dinotopia. I'm having a big party tonight

3057
04:57:32,459 --> 04:57:34,459
And I thought some apple pies would be nice to have

3058
04:57:34,939 --> 04:57:38,299
My friends are donating the apples and have placed them throughout town

3059
04:57:38,779 --> 04:57:42,380
But I've got to get my house cleaned and don't have the time so weird more

3060
04:57:42,619 --> 04:57:46,380
Would you be so kind as to get to collect all the apples baskets?

3061
04:57:46,619 --> 04:57:49,340
I'll trade you some of my hobby peppers for the apples

3062
04:57:53,000 --> 04:57:55,000
Okay, I see one right here

3063
04:57:57,659 --> 04:57:59,659
That wasn't his dog was that this

3064
04:57:59,979 --> 04:58:01,580
There's like friend

3065
04:58:01,580 --> 04:58:03,659
Or it's like

3066
04:58:03,659 --> 04:58:05,900
Significant other or something. I don't know. Uh, this is um

3067
04:58:06,619 --> 04:58:14,779
I don't know they could talk

3068
04:58:14,779 --> 04:58:16,299
This is neighbor

3069
04:58:16,299 --> 04:58:19,310
What's the look this little kid here?

3070
04:58:19,549 --> 04:58:24,119
You can't talk to the kid

3071
04:58:24,119 --> 04:58:26,119
This looks so strange

3072
04:58:26,119 --> 04:58:40,759
Where you go? Oh, there he is

3073
04:58:42,880 --> 04:58:47,049
skip

3074
04:58:47,049 --> 04:58:49,049
Dinotopia. Oh, hold on. What do you have?

3075
04:58:49,369 --> 04:58:54,840
Haven't found all my apples yet. I'm working on it

3076
04:59:00,650 --> 04:59:03,049
Breathe deep young drake gemini

3077
04:59:03,930 --> 04:59:06,169
Seek peace. Are you miss oxbridge?

3078
04:59:06,810 --> 04:59:13,049
Why yes, I will get the apples. I promise my friend castor pollock sent word that he has trained you in the use of a weapon

3079
04:59:13,529 --> 04:59:16,729
You must be cautious with a weapon after all

3080
04:59:17,209 --> 04:59:20,490
The code of dinotopia states that weapons are enemies

3081
04:59:21,130 --> 04:59:25,529
Even to their own the dumbest thing i've ever heard if you are to use this weapon responsibly

3082
04:59:26,169 --> 04:59:32,250
You must wield it as a guardian of dinotopia. You should only use it to help those in need

3083
04:59:32,889 --> 04:59:35,689
And never in a hateful manner. Tell me

3084
04:59:36,569 --> 04:59:39,549
Why do you seek to be a guardian of dinotopia?

3085
04:59:41,900 --> 04:59:44,459
Well, it's not like i'm really seeking it out

3086
04:59:45,259 --> 04:59:47,659
My father deeply loved dinotopia

3087
04:59:48,299 --> 04:59:53,659
Before he passed on he made my brother and me promise to defend dinotopia. It's like a

3088
04:59:54,220 --> 05:00:00,540
My brother's like a mallet. It's a broomstick with a fucking shoehorn on the end faced with life in this land all alone

3089
05:00:01,419 --> 05:00:08,380
The only thing i've ever really cared about is my family. No, all i've got left of it is the promise that I made to my father

3090
05:00:08,860 --> 05:00:10,380
So

3091
05:00:10,380 --> 05:00:15,979
Perhaps in time you may realize your family can extend beyond your relatives

3092
05:00:16,619 --> 05:00:20,700
One thing is for sure young drake. You are not alone

3093
05:00:21,659 --> 05:00:27,180
If you will face the perils of dinotopia's defense, you will need to become stronger

3094
05:00:27,740 --> 05:00:32,380
One thing you must understand is that the entirety of one's strength

3095
05:00:33,099 --> 05:00:37,580
Comes from a balance of one's mind body and spirit

3096
05:00:38,459 --> 05:00:44,459
In my you want the lore I defended dinotopia really I used a stone mallet to defeat

3097
05:00:44,619 --> 05:00:51,180
All those that sought to harm this wonderful land something about the way that their brains would squish mallet for what seems like

3098
05:00:51,419 --> 05:00:58,060
And their skull and brain matter would explode just did it for me within a strong box on a distant platform

3099
05:00:58,540 --> 05:01:01,020
As an exercise to strengthen your mind

3100
05:01:01,740 --> 05:01:08,139
If you can figure out how to get to this strong box and then return to me with the artifact

3101
05:01:08,860 --> 05:01:11,020
I will reward you with the mallet head

3102
05:01:11,979 --> 05:01:14,430
Okay

3103
05:01:14,430 --> 05:01:16,430
Oh, I just there's a jumping quest

3104
05:01:16,590 --> 05:01:19,759
Where is that?

3105
05:01:19,759 --> 05:01:20,799
Over here

3106
05:01:20,799 --> 05:01:23,740
I got the apples for that guy, too

3107
05:01:23,740 --> 05:01:33,880
Can't do it. Don't worry

3108
05:01:33,880 --> 05:01:35,720
smash a dino's brain

3109
05:01:35,720 --> 05:01:43,119
What is it back here?

3110
05:01:43,119 --> 05:01:45,200
Oh shit, it's another dinosaur doesn't talk to

3111
05:01:52,119 --> 05:01:53,000
What?

3112
05:01:53,000 --> 05:02:02,409
Was that just imagining him talking?

3113
05:02:04,279 --> 05:02:06,279
Well, i'm really going crazy

3114
05:02:13,770 --> 05:02:15,610
Apples, all right three four

3115
05:02:15,610 --> 05:02:18,430
He didn't talk dude. What are you talking about?

3116
05:02:19,709 --> 05:02:22,650
I'm the crazy one

3117
05:02:22,650 --> 05:02:24,409
Where's this thing to jump to?

3118
05:02:24,409 --> 05:02:35,979
This game's amazing

3119
05:02:35,979 --> 05:02:37,979
I'm i'm here for a while

3120
05:02:38,060 --> 05:02:48,000
I'm not giving up on this

3121
05:02:48,000 --> 05:02:53,759
Where is this thing to do?

3122
05:02:53,759 --> 05:02:55,759
Game's incredible. All right, i'm gonna play it

3123
05:02:57,479 --> 05:03:00,680
Just would oh it's up there. Okay, it's up. How do I get up there?

3124
05:03:01,560 --> 05:03:09,770
Help me. How do I get up there?

3125
05:03:09,770 --> 05:03:19,099
How do I get up there?

3126
05:03:19,099 --> 05:03:21,209
Can I go up even higher?

3127
05:03:21,209 --> 05:03:24,779
Who's your destination?

3128
05:03:24,779 --> 05:03:26,779
Uh treetop manor

3129
05:03:26,939 --> 05:03:48,330
A completely different area

3130
05:03:48,330 --> 05:03:50,650
It is but I don't think I could go anywhere in the last area

3131
05:03:58,750 --> 05:04:04,880
Why can't they talk?

3132
05:04:06,319 --> 05:04:07,360
Is this it?

3133
05:04:07,360 --> 05:04:11,360
Does it look like it was down? I mean it was up from where I was

3134
05:04:12,159 --> 05:04:19,869
I have no idea

3135
05:04:19,869 --> 05:04:25,279
This way

3136
05:04:25,279 --> 05:04:29,439
It was a prompt and you missed the area

3137
05:04:30,319 --> 05:04:36,810
Go back to the other

3138
05:04:36,810 --> 05:04:38,330
Go back to the other woman

3139
05:04:38,330 --> 05:04:40,750
Come on

3140
05:04:40,750 --> 05:04:46,759
Oh, come on. Really?

3141
05:04:46,759 --> 05:04:54,639
Do I just go back to that other area?

3142
05:04:55,439 --> 05:05:02,279
Is it in that that just same zone?

3143
05:05:03,240 --> 05:05:19,979
I mean, i'll be honest every single thing looks identical. There's no math. I have no idea where I am

3144
05:05:28,139 --> 05:05:30,380
I don't even know what that place was called town center

3145
05:05:37,159 --> 05:05:40,590
Yeah, I look right over here

3146
05:05:40,590 --> 05:05:42,590
Like not do anything about that

3147
05:05:42,669 --> 05:05:52,400
Oh, what the fuck is that?

3148
05:05:52,560 --> 05:05:57,419
Oh my god. All right. Here it is. So I have to jump to that

3149
05:05:58,060 --> 05:06:02,090
How am I supposed to jump to that?

3150
05:06:02,090 --> 05:06:15,119
That's really difficult to do this sucked. All right break these

3151
05:06:20,860 --> 05:06:26,840
Oh, i'm really glad I did that because it would have taken me a very long time. It just fell off the edge

3152
05:06:27,400 --> 05:06:35,610
I i'm fine. I'm good. Give me the weapon

3153
05:06:39,180 --> 05:06:43,799
Turn the statue and then I need one more thing of apples. I would like this

3154
05:06:50,959 --> 05:06:59,389
Apples good job young drake

3155
05:06:59,950 --> 05:07:04,750
You have proven to me that you are worthy of receiving this stone man in 30 minutes

3156
05:07:04,909 --> 05:07:07,790
I am not stopping until I fight at least five dinosaurs

3157
05:07:08,750 --> 05:07:16,400
Which mallet heads?

3158
05:07:16,400 --> 05:07:18,500
Um everybody get down. I thought it was a pterodactyl

3159
05:07:26,970 --> 05:07:28,970
But all animals talk in this world, right?

3160
05:07:29,599 --> 05:07:34,509
Oh my you'd better get to the hatchery hopefully the matriarch is all right

3161
05:07:35,150 --> 05:07:36,830
Remember drake

3162
05:07:36,830 --> 05:07:39,790
Only please this is not dyno topia. This is cringe topia

3163
05:07:40,990 --> 05:07:43,549
To help those in danger of being harmed

3164
05:07:44,189 --> 05:07:46,750
and never ever out of hatred

3165
05:07:47,709 --> 05:07:50,200
What would the difference be if I were to?

3166
05:07:50,599 --> 05:07:52,680
Punch someone in the face right now out of hatred

3167
05:07:53,319 --> 05:07:55,599
Does that change things?

3168
05:07:55,599 --> 05:08:00,159
Like if I were to punch you in the face right now because I hate you does that make it different because I didn't use a weapon

3169
05:08:00,880 --> 05:08:12,400
Travel between areas of the forest outpost using gondolas like the one you arrived in go to the hatchery

3170
05:08:12,959 --> 05:08:22,139
All right. I need apples. It's moral points

3171
05:08:22,779 --> 05:08:27,159
Is it really?

3172
05:08:27,159 --> 05:08:29,159
All right. I need this other guy's apples. Where are they?

3173
05:08:38,889 --> 05:08:41,209
Where's the final bushel of apples?

3174
05:08:45,450 --> 05:08:47,209
this is actually a

3175
05:08:47,209 --> 05:08:49,529
Good and evil system. That's pretty funny actually

3176
05:08:50,250 --> 05:09:04,720
To the right of these fucking apples

3177
05:09:05,599 --> 05:09:13,529
This is a book tv show tie-in game

3178
05:09:14,169 --> 05:09:25,319
Go back up

3179
05:09:25,319 --> 05:09:28,599
All right, I don't think there's another bushel of apples on this floor

3180
05:09:29,479 --> 05:09:45,340
This is not where the hell are they it's right there

3181
05:09:51,159 --> 05:10:07,020
It's not right here right here. All right. What do I get for doing this?

3182
05:10:07,580 --> 05:10:20,060
Great. You've got the hobie peppers now and get these peeled and into the pies

3183
05:10:21,819 --> 05:10:23,819
All right, so I got hobie peppers now let's go

3184
05:10:24,540 --> 05:10:26,060
to the hatchery

3185
05:10:26,060 --> 05:10:29,819
And rescue the dinos in trouble. I don't know

3186
05:10:30,540 --> 05:10:40,349
Is that what I'm supposed to do?

3187
05:10:40,349 --> 05:10:43,150
You're not wearing any pants. I think I believe i'm wearing pants

3188
05:10:45,560 --> 05:10:53,150
What's that exit?

3189
05:10:53,150 --> 05:10:55,150
Fuck close the get down

3190
05:10:55,229 --> 05:10:57,069
Where's the how do I get out of here?

3191
05:10:57,069 --> 05:11:13,200
Okay, here we go hatchery exit

3192
05:11:13,200 --> 05:11:15,950
The hatchery is under attack

3193
05:11:15,950 --> 05:11:29,529
It doesn't look like anybody's really

3194
05:11:29,529 --> 05:11:33,759
That concerned about whatever's happening. I'm not seeing any very much panic

3195
05:11:34,319 --> 05:11:47,259
Have you done fable two yet? I have not done fable two. I don't play I played i've beaten that game like three times

3196
05:11:48,700 --> 05:11:53,689
But not on stream

3197
05:11:53,689 --> 05:11:55,389
next game

3198
05:11:55,470 --> 05:12:00,349
Well, I mean it depends it depends if this is if this continues to be a snooze fest i'm gonna move on

3199
05:12:08,919 --> 05:12:15,049
Okay, let's go. Yeah, I want to see at least a dinosaur or two

3200
05:12:15,689 --> 05:12:26,270
Fable two would be awesome. That's you know, what? That's a really good idea

3201
05:12:27,069 --> 05:12:37,580
Get fable two on the list. I will play through fable two defend the hatchery

3202
05:12:38,220 --> 05:12:56,380
We've got so many games on the list already

3203
05:12:56,380 --> 05:13:03,439
Is this all right? Come on. Let's go. Okay. I feel like this is empty. It's like am I in the

3204
05:13:04,569 --> 05:13:08,250
Like the dev game the dev kit whatever it is like why is it nothing here

3205
05:13:18,200 --> 05:13:21,180
Fable sucks fable three sucks

3206
05:13:22,380 --> 05:13:27,759
Right from what I remember

3207
05:13:30,479 --> 05:13:32,080
Who am I fighting here

3208
05:13:32,080 --> 05:13:38,169
Who's the bad guy?

3209
05:13:38,169 --> 05:13:40,650
In this scenario, am I am I fighting the humans?

3210
05:13:41,290 --> 05:13:54,090
This dinosaur is the is the one getting attacked

3211
05:14:02,990 --> 05:14:05,549
This really is just like dumpy fable with dinosaurs

3212
05:14:06,909 --> 05:14:09,229
But not even fable. This is way worse than fable

3213
05:14:12,650 --> 05:14:17,549
Thank you for helping me if you had gotten here any later, this is so boring

3214
05:14:21,689 --> 05:14:23,689
But there's so much potential

3215
05:14:28,380 --> 05:14:33,720
Get away

3216
05:14:33,720 --> 05:14:37,799
There's so much potential here. Look at it. It's so it's right here in front of us

3217
05:14:38,759 --> 05:14:40,119
We can taste it

3218
05:14:40,119 --> 05:14:46,090
What's wrong with fable three?

3219
05:14:46,090 --> 05:14:48,970
Um fable three is you like open chests to make decisions

3220
05:14:49,610 --> 05:14:50,970
It's stupid

3221
05:14:51,049 --> 05:14:55,689
You go to like the the weird world where you like have to make decisions by using a currency

3222
05:14:56,330 --> 05:14:58,330
I hated that it was stupid

3223
05:15:02,990 --> 05:15:07,470
Unlock like the next like thing to try the next decision to make with like a fucking chest currency thing

3224
05:15:07,709 --> 05:15:09,950
The game is dumb. It was this dumb currency thing. I hated it

3225
05:15:13,040 --> 05:15:17,200
Make sure you got like followers to open the chests. No, I want to just like decide if i'm gonna execute the guy

3226
05:15:18,220 --> 05:15:19,259
Or not

3227
05:15:19,259 --> 05:15:21,259
Give me that decision. I just want to make that decision

3228
05:15:22,750 --> 05:15:25,470
Do I steal the bread or do I not steal the bread make it simple for me?

3229
05:15:38,330 --> 05:15:41,150
Your memory is terrible. I don't think it is that's yeah, then fable

3230
05:15:49,040 --> 05:15:51,040
I thought it was jar jar things

3231
05:16:07,200 --> 05:16:10,240
If you bring me three of these bright blue plants

3232
05:16:10,400 --> 05:16:14,240
I'll give you some information about a sunstone. I don't want to play anymore

3233
05:16:18,430 --> 05:16:21,310
I'm done next game next one. I don't want to play this one anymore

3234
05:16:21,950 --> 05:16:28,409
Wait, this guy's a hostel

3235
05:16:28,409 --> 05:16:44,669
It's a cave man. Yeah, I guess

3236
05:16:45,150 --> 05:16:52,659
That dinosaur looks like my school superintendent

3237
05:16:57,240 --> 05:17:01,720
Huh?

3238
05:17:01,720 --> 05:17:04,840
What are you talking about? How what are you even talking about?

3239
05:17:05,799 --> 05:17:11,369
Especially just want to play fable two

3240
05:17:14,000 --> 05:17:16,000
Should I yay? Should I?

3241
05:17:16,669 --> 05:17:18,669
Can I play should I start fable two?

3242
05:17:18,909 --> 05:17:27,560
Should I play fable two next week and just like beat it like play through it over the weekend?

3243
05:17:31,080 --> 05:17:33,319
Okay, but hold on though. It is fable

3244
05:17:34,119 --> 05:17:39,799
Is my brain remembering is that game actually good and fun and interesting and shit? Like I don't remember

3245
05:17:40,279 --> 05:17:43,930
I think it is right

3246
05:17:44,090 --> 05:17:57,450
There's a game called dyno topia and you just fight

3247
05:17:58,549 --> 05:18:00,549
defias bandits with shields

3248
05:18:04,080 --> 05:18:05,599
I fall down

3249
05:18:05,599 --> 05:18:16,779
What do I have superpowers?

3250
05:18:17,740 --> 05:18:23,580
You said you beat fable two like three times I did like 10 years ago. I don't remember anything about the game

3251
05:18:24,990 --> 05:18:26,990
All I remember is this one specific line

3252
05:18:27,389 --> 05:18:31,119
It'll be as normal as the sound of your own heartbeat

3253
05:18:31,919 --> 05:18:35,919
I don't know what the context is. I don't know where the character is. I just remember that line

3254
05:18:36,080 --> 05:18:38,080
I don't know what that means, but I know it's in the game

3255
05:18:43,450 --> 05:18:45,450
play fable three

3256
05:18:46,330 --> 05:19:04,540
Whoa, that's cool play gothic. I have gothic three. I think I have all the gothic games installed right now

3257
05:19:06,319 --> 05:19:08,799
I keep adding shit to lists and then I never play them

3258
05:19:15,259 --> 05:19:19,259
I have so many games that you're just gonna see trickled in over like months and years of time

3259
05:19:20,060 --> 05:19:22,520
Sometimes I forget I even bought them or installed them

3260
05:19:23,240 --> 05:19:27,080
And then it takes somebody to remind me like oh, hey, dude play gothic and i'm like, oh, yeah

3261
05:19:27,240 --> 05:19:30,040
I have fucking every gothic installed right now. I have all of them

3262
05:19:31,360 --> 05:19:33,360
All right, god doesn't play that

3263
05:19:43,159 --> 05:19:46,680
Three is shit. Yeah, I would play two before I play three. I talk to the

3264
05:19:48,360 --> 05:19:51,689
I can't talk to the one source

3265
05:19:51,689 --> 05:19:59,500
Please god do not play sneak king

3266
05:20:00,540 --> 05:20:02,540
I already did and everybody hated it. Yeah, I did too

3267
05:20:05,950 --> 05:20:07,950
Oh, I need to play nba street as well

3268
05:20:08,990 --> 05:20:10,270
nba street

3269
05:20:10,270 --> 05:20:13,130
I think one of my favorite games on xbox 360 and xbox

3270
05:20:18,080 --> 05:20:19,840
Oh fuck. I need to play that

3271
05:20:19,840 --> 05:20:28,990
I'm a street is probably the best game

3272
05:20:29,310 --> 05:20:37,259
That's a sports game. Let's make that clear and the nba street franchise

3273
05:20:37,740 --> 05:20:43,740
Was the best sports franchise that and slugfest and they just decided to stop making them because for some stupid ass reason

3274
05:20:44,619 --> 05:20:52,939
Every video game company decided that simulations and realistic take me seriously video games were what everybody I apparently cared about and nobody does

3275
05:20:55,319 --> 05:20:59,720
Where are the crazy fucking slugfest games? Where's where's nfl blitz?

3276
05:21:00,599 --> 05:21:05,720
Why I don't want to play madden. I want to play blitz. I don't want to play mlb the show

3277
05:21:06,040 --> 05:21:11,400
I want to play slugfest. I don't want to fucking play nba 2k. I want to play nba street

3278
05:21:12,119 --> 05:21:14,119
Why did they stop making these games?

3279
05:21:16,479 --> 05:21:18,889
They stopped making them

3280
05:21:18,889 --> 05:21:26,090
We have like a full two generations of consoles of new technology and new engines. That would be so much fun with these games

3281
05:21:28,590 --> 05:21:30,590
How would you stop making nfl blitz?

3282
05:21:36,380 --> 05:21:41,500
Dude nba street, it's not like oh, they wouldn't be popular. They're not popular. They weren't that popular. You're misremembering things

3283
05:21:41,979 --> 05:21:43,979
NBA street was so popular

3284
05:21:44,779 --> 05:21:49,659
It was one of the most fun arcade games ever. It was so good

3285
05:21:50,380 --> 05:21:53,900
I want to make like another one

3286
05:21:56,060 --> 05:22:01,180
And they've they've done a go nba jam. Yeah, remember when we like ported that to fucking iphones

3287
05:22:01,659 --> 05:22:03,819
No, no, no, give me another one. Give me a new one

3288
05:22:04,380 --> 05:22:06,700
That you didn't just like make it in flash

3289
05:22:08,569 --> 05:22:13,930
Hey guys, remember nba jam. Oh, you're gonna love this one. The only difference is we made it in flash this time

3290
05:22:14,490 --> 05:22:18,779
Well, you know, I don't like come on. You mean give me a real one

3291
05:22:19,580 --> 05:22:30,409
Please stop hogging the xbox. Your brother wants to play halo

3292
05:22:31,279 --> 05:22:34,159
Fuck halo

3293
05:22:34,159 --> 05:22:36,159
The matriarch is ill

3294
05:22:36,319 --> 05:22:37,840
Just look at her

3295
05:22:37,840 --> 05:22:39,840
You have to find the antidote drake

3296
05:22:40,560 --> 05:22:46,959
Relax just jesus with the spear has the antidote in a diamond shaped vial. It's blue

3297
05:22:47,599 --> 05:22:53,279
Get it and bring it back quickly to our beloved matriarch. I have no idea what's happening in this world

3298
05:22:54,080 --> 05:22:57,720
Oh, what is the matriarch?

3299
05:22:57,979 --> 05:23:00,220
You have to look for the leader drake

3300
05:23:00,700 --> 05:23:05,580
Hurry the matriarch is what did we miss a very important piece of history in this world?

3301
05:23:06,540 --> 05:23:18,380
Please get it

3302
05:23:18,380 --> 05:23:20,380
Yeah, and why is it?

3303
05:23:20,720 --> 05:23:22,799
Uh, I don't even get me going on this bullshit

3304
05:23:24,349 --> 05:23:26,930
I ever everyone wanted to take their game so seriously

3305
05:23:27,709 --> 05:23:34,240
No, no, no, we can't have anything like funny or fun or interesting or like not realistic in our like wrestling game

3306
05:23:34,319 --> 05:23:36,000
It's got to be a fucking

3307
05:23:36,000 --> 05:23:40,400
Guy with underwear on simulation where you like simulate wrestling and it's real

3308
05:23:42,400 --> 05:23:44,400
No, no, no, you have to go for a first down

3309
05:23:45,360 --> 05:23:48,180
Touchdown got it real. This is a real simulation

3310
05:23:51,049 --> 05:23:55,689
Give me the fucked up shit again. It was stuff was so fucked up. You could just do whatever you wanted

3311
05:23:55,689 --> 05:23:58,080
It was so much more fun

3312
05:23:58,080 --> 05:24:02,799
I don't want to pretend i'm playing a game of football. I want to drop kick somebody in the head

3313
05:24:03,360 --> 05:24:05,759
while they're running for a touchdown and then I want them to like

3314
05:24:06,639 --> 05:24:08,639
Just roundhouse kick me in the stomach

3315
05:24:09,200 --> 05:24:13,759
And have a fumble happen and then we both have to fist fight to get the ball. That's fucking fun

3316
05:24:14,319 --> 05:24:17,759
I don't want to sit there and play a fake pretend game of football

3317
05:24:18,400 --> 05:24:31,279
And everyone's saying blood bowl but blood bowl isn't blood bowl like a turn-based strategy game. It's not what i'm looking for

3318
05:24:38,599 --> 05:24:40,040
I want an nba street

3319
05:24:40,040 --> 05:24:42,680
You could do these crazy moves where the ball went under your leg

3320
05:24:42,680 --> 05:24:43,479
They went behind your back

3321
05:24:43,479 --> 05:24:46,840
You did like a backflip and then you did a huge slam dunk before you slam dunked

3322
05:24:47,080 --> 05:24:49,240
Right before the ball went in the net you passed it to your teammate

3323
05:24:49,400 --> 05:24:53,000
You were in the air then he goes in the air you pass it back to the guy that goes into the air

3324
05:24:53,159 --> 05:24:56,119
And he did two front flip slam dunks and it was like four million points

3325
05:24:57,360 --> 05:25:00,000
I loved it. It was like uh, tony hawke. It was like tony hawke with sports

3326
05:25:00,799 --> 05:25:04,380
Where am I? What am I doing?

3327
05:25:04,380 --> 05:25:17,159
How do I get over there? You're ranting

3328
05:25:18,159 --> 05:25:21,840
Yeah, I know I am because like what have they done?

3329
05:25:23,040 --> 05:25:25,040
To sports video games

3330
05:25:25,119 --> 05:25:34,970
I was supposed to switch games. Oh, right, right, right

3331
05:25:35,450 --> 05:25:45,040
What I just do

3332
05:25:45,040 --> 05:25:47,040
I want a wrestling game and you know, I'm

3333
05:25:47,360 --> 05:25:49,919
I want a wrestling game where the rules can be crazy

3334
05:25:51,000 --> 05:25:54,919
Like I want the ring to be covered in ice and just have ai fight each other and see what they do

3335
05:25:56,349 --> 05:25:58,830
You know, how fun would that be it'd be fun just to do that

3336
05:26:08,110 --> 05:26:12,909
And then you got wwe and wwe the last wwe 2k game was so fucking awful

3337
05:26:13,229 --> 05:26:15,950
That they stopped making it for like two years because they were like, holy shit

3338
05:26:15,950 --> 05:26:17,950
We gotta like try to make this even remotely good

3339
05:26:19,229 --> 05:26:20,830
I hope they do

3340
05:26:20,830 --> 05:26:27,040
I hope they go back

3341
05:26:27,040 --> 05:26:30,479
And do it the old the way that it was done like six or seven years ago

3342
05:26:37,689 --> 05:26:43,130
And that's not boomer. This is not like oh the way things are used to be I'm talking about like five years ago

3343
05:26:43,209 --> 05:26:46,750
Not like 20. We're talking like five or six years ago

3344
05:26:56,430 --> 05:26:58,430
This game is awful

3345
05:27:03,549 --> 05:27:05,549
Like i'm talking like 2014

3346
05:27:05,689 --> 05:27:08,240
2013

3347
05:27:08,240 --> 05:27:12,560
How long ago was that it was like seven years ago, but whatever you get it. It's not that long ago. It's within 10 years

3348
05:27:13,279 --> 05:27:22,520
Why are you still playing it?

3349
05:27:22,520 --> 05:27:25,959
Well, because it's I don't know. It's a it's a means to deliver my rant to you

3350
05:27:26,520 --> 05:27:28,840
It's not a means to deliver a gameplay video

3351
05:27:29,400 --> 05:27:33,759
Well, what am I putting in next? Let me see watch this shitty

3352
05:27:33,759 --> 05:27:37,680
Cussing outside or drug you and drake here retrieve the antidote

I know it is not much but

3355
05:27:44,400 --> 05:27:48,259
Except these gauntlets as a small sign of my appreciation

3356
05:27:49,279 --> 05:27:52,099
They will help protect your hands and forearms

3357
05:27:53,119 --> 05:27:55,119
I hate to be a bother

3358
05:27:55,200 --> 05:28:00,319
But if you are on your way back to the forest i would appreciate it

3359
05:28:00,400 --> 05:28:07,459
If you could bring this eggshell extract to the herbalist there, I am sure she will reward you for its delivery

3360
05:28:16,970 --> 05:28:20,029
Deliver the eggshell extract to the herbalist at the forest outpost

3361
05:28:21,049 --> 05:28:24,409
Well, I have to play this because otherwise, what am I ever gonna play this again?

3362
05:28:25,369 --> 05:28:27,369
There's no reason to I have it

3363
05:28:27,610 --> 05:28:32,139
This game's terrible. We thought there was gonna be a t-rex and shit and it's not it's just like

3364
05:28:33,560 --> 05:28:35,560
Talking animals the game

3365
05:28:36,279 --> 05:28:39,259
All right. Here we go

Uh turns out I did not throw it in the trash. I have it right here

3367
05:28:44,220 --> 05:28:46,400

3369
05:28:49,360 --> 05:28:51,360
This is the time to do this

3370
05:28:51,869 --> 05:28:53,549
So let's put it in

3371
05:28:53,549 --> 05:29:20,669
It's halo 2

3372
05:29:28,430 --> 05:29:48,970
Come on load

3374
05:30:09,240 --> 05:30:10,919
single player

3375
05:30:10,919 --> 05:30:12,599
Great character

3376
05:30:12,599 --> 05:30:20,090
Aren't you the king have it your way customize your character

3377
05:30:20,729 --> 05:30:25,500

Okay, select character. How is this customizing? I'll be brett

3379
05:30:48,360 --> 05:30:52,220
hair hat helmet

3380
05:30:52,220 --> 05:31:05,119
You really want to save what this is not this is just just I don't why even put this in

3381
05:31:05,759 --> 05:31:14,080
I need to make like a lettuce tomato

3382
05:31:15,560 --> 05:31:27,869
Like pickles it's the joker your name for your character

3383
05:31:30,040 --> 05:31:31,159
I don't

3384
05:31:31,159 --> 05:31:38,330
Didn't you already have a name?

3385
05:31:38,389 --> 05:31:56,430
Arthur no, I don't care about this. I'm gonna play this for 15 minutes. Why I know I don't need to make him

3386
05:31:56,990 --> 05:32:07,959
I've done a name him. You're gonna forget about him tomorrow. You made jeff hardy. He does look like jeff hardy

3387
05:32:19,520 --> 05:32:21,520
Are you so i'm not angry what are you talking about?

3388
05:32:33,479 --> 05:32:36,360
I can't believe you said this is gonna be halo 2

3389
05:32:47,369 --> 05:32:49,369
Uh rides rides

3390
05:32:52,110 --> 05:32:55,450
Garage, all right. My car is gonna be green one

3391
05:32:56,889 --> 05:33:02,990
And then rides the broiler the deep king's court. All right, we're gonna go to king's court

3392
05:33:04,110 --> 05:33:09,340
You'll probably guess the way this is played to hit the puck into your opponent's goal

3393
05:33:09,819 --> 05:33:12,220
Wait, this did they make rocket league before rocket league?

3394
05:33:12,939 --> 05:33:16,970
This would be wild if this is what this is

3395
05:33:17,130 --> 05:33:40,729
This is rocket league chicken

3396
05:33:43,639 --> 05:33:46,680
I didn't even take a character. What who am I what team am I on?

3397
05:33:47,400 --> 05:33:56,430
I'm on red team. I just won

3398
05:33:58,520 --> 05:34:00,360
You're always the king

3399
05:34:00,360 --> 05:34:03,319
Well, what's the point of customizing a character if I always have to play as the king?

3400
05:34:08,779 --> 05:34:10,860
This looks like the floor of a public bathroom. I'll just tell you

3401
05:34:16,139 --> 05:34:22,430
What do you mean own goal

3402
05:34:22,430 --> 05:34:25,630
You can choose the characters. I don't care to choose the characters

3403
05:34:35,020 --> 05:34:37,020
Oh god, I can't wait to play blinks the cat

3404
05:34:38,240 --> 05:34:40,880
We gotta get we have to get the really shitty ones out first

3405
05:34:41,599 --> 05:34:59,080

3406
05:34:59,080 --> 05:35:01,080
I got one more. I want to play tonight

3407
05:35:01,159 --> 05:35:08,279
And this one could be really good and I mean very like incredible it's possible we'll see I have high hopes for the final game

3408
05:35:20,200 --> 05:35:22,360
Get out of here get out of my goal

3409
05:35:27,680 --> 05:35:30,880
It's the frame rate. The frame rate is making me motion sick. It actually is

3410
05:35:33,659 --> 05:35:36,860
Oh, this hurts. I'm actually my throw up. I just stopped playing

3411
05:35:37,419 --> 05:35:38,459
Yeah

3412
05:35:38,459 --> 05:35:41,419
I feel terrible. I feel awful right now

3413
05:35:42,299 --> 05:35:44,299
Oh my god, I feel awful

3414
05:35:44,299 --> 05:35:54,599
I feel awful

3415
05:35:54,599 --> 05:36:10,009
Are they all the same? Oh, they're all the same aren't they? This is just this is every every mario party game. I got you

3416
05:36:25,209 --> 05:36:26,889
That was way worse than any

3417
05:36:26,889 --> 05:36:29,529
Okay. Oh i'm done. I'm gonna play the game. I want to play

3418
05:36:30,250 --> 05:36:32,779
the game i'm about to put in

3419
05:36:32,779 --> 05:36:33,580
is

3420
05:36:33,580 --> 05:36:35,979
Uh, it had it has a lot of potential

3421
05:36:36,540 --> 05:36:39,209
Remember all these xbox games are all based on potential

3422
05:36:39,849 --> 05:36:42,090
Uh, we're gonna play omerta city of gangsters

3423
05:36:42,650 --> 05:36:47,439
This is yeah, i'm not gonna give this 30 minutes. This game's just horrible

3424
05:36:55,159 --> 05:36:57,159
Isn't this one on pc? It actually might be

3425
05:37:00,650 --> 05:37:09,560
I got it on my xbox. I thought we can play blinks. That will be for another night. Why do I do that?

3426
05:37:10,759 --> 05:37:20,139
What's the point of me doing that? What's wrong with this?

3427
05:37:22,860 --> 05:37:26,560
Get it in there. Come on. Let's go. All right read disk

3428
05:37:35,930 --> 05:37:37,930
Come on. Let's hurry up load it up

3429
05:37:38,250 --> 05:37:50,279
Download to human if this doesn't work. It's gonna take me like an hour to download that game through original xbox 360

3430
05:37:58,330 --> 05:38:00,569
Hold on. Why is that name familiar? What else did they do today?

3431
05:38:01,799 --> 05:38:05,150
Wait, they made

3432
05:38:05,150 --> 05:38:26,569
They made the templar game the first templar was calypso. Give it a try new game. Let's just do it

3433
05:38:28,090 --> 05:38:30,090
urge his name the boss

3434
05:38:38,240 --> 05:38:42,080
Uh, i'm gonna this part this I I think I connect with this guy the most I think

3435
05:38:44,810 --> 05:38:47,369
He's like he just kind of has he looks like it could be me

3436
05:38:48,009 --> 05:38:51,849
You grew up in a small village in sicily your childhood nickname was

3437
05:38:52,970 --> 05:38:54,970
Uh, obviously betty's

3438
05:38:55,900 --> 05:38:59,099
When you grew up enough you far when you grew up enough your father

3439
05:38:59,500 --> 05:39:03,340
Decided that you should learn diligence and learn a trade you became apprentice to

3440
05:39:04,540 --> 05:39:06,540
stones the shopkeeper

3441
05:39:06,540 --> 05:39:10,270
The most ridiculous feat you managed to pull off during your youth was

3442
05:39:11,310 --> 05:39:15,869
Stealing the key for the village mayor's wine cellar and drinking most of it before you were discovered

3443
05:39:17,229 --> 05:39:19,549
wrestling an enraged bull with your bare hands

3444
05:39:20,599 --> 05:39:26,439
Sweet talking a local loan shark to forgive your debt and give you even more money just until you get back on your feet

3445
05:39:29,419 --> 05:39:33,819
That one I've always said when you were 16 years old you fell in love with the prettiest girl in the village

3446
05:39:34,060 --> 05:39:36,060
Her brother challenged you to a duel

3447
05:39:36,619 --> 05:39:39,180
Since you were challenged you got to pick the weapon it was

3448
05:39:40,159 --> 05:39:48,439
Wait, just pick a gun and shoot him a knife

3449
05:39:50,029 --> 05:39:53,950
Bare fists you let your enemy pick confident. You can beat him with every weapon

3450
05:39:58,970 --> 05:40:04,430
Bare hands you decided to leave sicily and immigrate to america because

3451
05:40:04,990 --> 05:40:07,950
A don put a price on your head after you had an affair with his wife

3452
05:40:08,590 --> 05:40:12,009
A vendetta wiped out your family leaving you and your brother the only survivors

3453
05:40:13,069 --> 05:40:15,310
You decided to pursue the american dream in the land of opportunity

3454
05:40:15,790 --> 05:40:35,259
Let's go down and you're ready to select your difficulty level medium. Let's go negative one

3455
05:40:36,779 --> 05:40:52,409
Okay, why did I punch that guy? Yeah, why is the audio mixing is so bad on the xbox?

3456
05:41:07,759 --> 05:41:09,759
Select district main av

3457
05:41:10,080 --> 05:41:12,080
You can only go to main. Let's uh save the game

3458
05:41:17,520 --> 05:41:22,509
Okay main av

3459

I wish I had a neck like that one day. I really sometimes I do

3478

Okay

05:56:05,159 --> 05:56:07,799
What we got? That's okay. You don't want to throw it. You want to throw it in the cold zone, right?

3609
05:56:08,279 --> 05:56:09,799
That's not their hot zone, right?

05:57:09,439 --> 05:57:11,200
All right, I can't do that

3621
05:57:11,200 --> 05:57:13,520
Let's go change up

3622
05:57:13,520 --> 05:57:16,639
Should I go right in the middle?

3623
05:57:20,590 --> 05:57:27,450
I'm going curveball dropping out of the zone. Oops breaking ball called. I have a turbo meter. How do I use it?

3624
05:57:28,250 --> 05:57:35,319
Throw a perfect game for a billion off the debt. I don't think I could throw a perfect game

3625
05:57:35,799 --> 05:57:42,909
I think it's possible. I'll try i'll try it. Can I get that as a deal? I'll try

3626
05:57:44,750 --> 05:57:47,709
Oh my god. No, no, I want to use that. I don't want to use that. How do I take that off?

3627
05:57:49,310 --> 05:57:59,340
How do I take off the turbo mode deal? All right, i'm gonna really try what what's the counter?

3628
05:57:59,979 --> 05:58:02,619
Three and two. All right, i'm gonna throw a change up right out here

3629
05:58:07,720 --> 05:58:11,549
That's not a perfect game fielder is automatically selected for you

3630
05:58:12,279 --> 05:58:14,840
Run him towards the ball and he will make the catch if he is close enough

3631
05:58:17,080 --> 05:58:18,939
Did you choose a base?

3632
05:58:18,939 --> 05:58:20,939
All right, how about a no hitter? How about a no hitter?

3633
05:58:22,840 --> 05:58:28,619
Because yeah, that's not a perfect game right perfect game. Well, I actually know it is throw the ball base press the action. Yeah

3634
05:58:36,990 --> 05:58:44,560
No one has to no one can make it to first base. Okay, wait, I thought the hot light

3635
05:58:44,639 --> 05:58:50,880
I've been pitching it in their hot zones. We go

3636
05:58:52,240 --> 05:58:54,240
Doers don't understand baseball

3637
05:58:55,639 --> 05:58:59,880
Dude, why don't do this shit? You're right. You want to get us to be interested in sports again?

3638
05:59:01,049 --> 05:59:02,569
They gotta like get

3639
05:59:02,569 --> 05:59:09,159
Yep, well just hold off. I'm working on it. Okay, i'm working on it

3640
05:59:09,400 --> 05:59:20,680
I'm working on it. It was supposed to be there a year ago. I'm working on it. Just wait right here

3641
05:59:23,520 --> 05:59:27,869
perfect pitch

3642
05:59:27,869 --> 05:59:32,509
Last august I was supposed to do a stream and just wait. All right, i'm fucking working on it

3643
05:59:32,590 --> 05:59:34,590
It's gonna be it's gonna be my favorite stream ever

3644
05:59:35,479 --> 05:59:38,200
It will be the my most favorite thing i've ever done

3645
05:59:39,529 --> 05:59:47,099
On youtube twitch doesn't matter. It'll be my favorite thing i've ever done strike three sit down

3646
05:59:47,659 --> 05:59:56,729
I got here. Perfect game is intact

3647
05:59:56,729 --> 06:00:00,189
All right time to get time to win

3648
06:00:00,270 --> 06:00:02,270
sponge ball

3649
06:00:02,430 --> 06:00:04,430
Great approach in the play, okay hit the ball

3650
06:00:06,590 --> 06:00:10,349
Aim your hit into the field and do a contact swing for a good chance at a hit

3651
06:00:10,750 --> 06:00:12,750
Allowing hits will cause the pitcher's effectiveness to decrease

3652
06:00:13,310 --> 06:00:16,680
All right. Well, how do we do a power swing?

3653
06:00:20,619 --> 06:00:25,180
Direct your runner towards the base that you want to go to use the base radar to see where you are

3654
06:00:25,500 --> 06:00:27,500
So, okay left stick aim towards the base you want to go to

3655
06:00:28,619 --> 06:00:30,220
That's a double

3656
06:00:30,220 --> 06:00:33,610
No, it's not no, it's not stay back

3657
06:00:35,290 --> 06:00:37,470
What's the power swing

3658
06:00:37,950 --> 06:00:39,229
Who's this

3659
06:00:39,229 --> 06:00:44,569
Okay, first thing i was like what cartoon character is this guy?

3660
06:00:47,049 --> 06:00:52,889
Aim your hit into the field and execute a bunt bunting moves your bad. I'm not sacrificing bunting. Why would I do that?

3661
06:00:55,380 --> 06:00:57,380
sacrifice bunt

3662
06:00:58,330 --> 06:00:59,209
Up there

3663
06:00:59,209 --> 06:01:01,209
That's the he just I just hit into a double play shit

3664
06:01:05,900 --> 06:01:09,979
Go go. What are you doing? What if you run the second base run the second base?

3665
06:01:18,250 --> 06:01:21,049
Wait isn't I've only been this happy in clothes once

3666
06:01:21,049 --> 06:01:27,520
All right power swing seems you're gonna hit a home run right now over the monster

3667
06:01:31,099 --> 06:01:36,380
Okay, left bumper is move all your runners the next position. Yes, that's what I want get down it. Everybody go

3668
06:01:46,400 --> 06:01:54,599
All right, here's a random person steal you have to first initiate a lead-off. Okay, who should I steal with?

3669
06:01:57,759 --> 06:02:01,919
It's a hit and run get in

3670
06:02:03,900 --> 06:02:05,900
Timpy is here. Why is Timpy so big?

3671
06:02:08,159 --> 06:02:12,240
For a second. I did not know who this was. I was like who is this weird ant character

3672
06:02:16,799 --> 06:02:18,400
shit

3673
06:02:18,400 --> 06:02:21,599
How weak is uh is ren?

3674
06:02:23,549 --> 06:02:25,549
Timmy get up why is Timmy sleeping?

3675
06:02:42,830 --> 06:02:50,060
Shit it's all right. This really does look like a gta mod

3676
06:02:50,060 --> 06:02:54,990
What

3677
06:03:05,060 --> 06:03:10,000
I can't get over. Okay, perfect game. Come on. I gotta throw a perfect game

3678
06:03:17,090 --> 06:03:22,610
All the time it would take to do this it would take so much time to make a gta mod like this

3679
06:03:22,610 --> 06:03:25,810
And why would you do this?

3680
06:03:30,139 --> 06:03:32,139
Oh, I need to build my meter

3681
06:03:39,009 --> 06:03:41,009
Who the fuck is the pitcher?

3682
06:03:41,889 --> 06:03:44,049
That's powdered toast man

3683
06:03:45,150 --> 06:03:49,380
Let's strike out

3684
06:03:59,500 --> 06:04:02,939
The pitcher is spongebob. Why would you think that?

3685
06:04:14,020 --> 06:04:22,430
All right, I gotta settle down I need to get a perfect game. Oh shit. He just turbo mode

3686
06:04:22,990 --> 06:04:25,389
Uh-oh. I'm I'm counter turboing

3687
06:04:27,490 --> 06:04:29,490
Eat shit motherfucker

3688
06:04:31,229 --> 06:04:35,889
Yes

3689
06:04:35,889 --> 06:04:37,889
Uh-oh david ortiz

3690
06:04:40,159 --> 06:04:43,599
Oh, I was gonna say why don't I get david ortiz? He's gonna hit a home run

3691
06:04:49,409 --> 06:04:51,409
Stay away from david ortiz

3692
06:04:53,630 --> 06:04:55,490
Oh, no

3693
06:04:55,490 --> 06:04:56,849
It's a foul ball

3694
06:04:56,849 --> 06:04:59,599
It's i'm good. It's a foul ball

3695
06:04:59,840 --> 06:05:09,950
only one in one

3696
06:05:09,950 --> 06:05:11,630
Curveball in the dirt. Let's go

3697
06:05:11,630 --> 06:05:16,340
Come on swing at that david ortiz had so much trouble hitting curveballs down

3698
06:05:19,779 --> 06:05:22,139
again

3699
06:05:22,139 --> 06:05:25,020
Curveball down

3700
06:05:25,020 --> 06:05:27,020
Come on swing at it

3701
06:05:29,299 --> 06:05:30,740
Oh, i'm in trouble

3702
06:05:30,740 --> 06:05:42,669
I'm good. If you feel I can't make the catch switch to the fielder with the next best chances left trigger

3703
06:05:43,619 --> 06:05:45,619
Oh gas

3704
06:05:45,779 --> 06:05:47,860
And everyone told me did not put gas on team

3705
06:05:48,740 --> 06:05:50,979
You see how fast that she just threw that ball

3706
06:05:53,220 --> 06:05:57,939
Oh get gas off the team who's gas who omega low, okay you who and now

3707
06:06:00,240 --> 06:06:02,240
What's this shit?

3708
06:06:06,560 --> 06:06:12,259
Whatever

3709
06:06:12,659 --> 06:06:22,369
I don't know who this person is. All right, i'm gonna take a pitch. Wow, they still do steroids. It's a good hit

3710
06:06:25,860 --> 06:06:29,860
Oh, I hate that character. It looks like it looks like it's like brian griffin or something

3711
06:06:32,700 --> 06:06:38,509
Indeed to bring in the left-handed pitcher here. Wait, they took out they took sheen out

3712
06:06:42,459 --> 06:06:49,380
Already subbing out sheen

3713
06:06:51,139 --> 06:06:55,400
That's gonna make me laugh i'm gonna be like in the bathtub tonight and i'm gonna be laughing hysterically

3714
06:06:56,180 --> 06:07:01,540
I'm gonna be just sitting with like just relaxing with my eyes closed and i'm just gonna start it's gonna hurt and start laughing hard

3715
06:07:06,669 --> 06:07:12,060
Shit

3716
06:07:12,060 --> 06:07:14,299
Come on spongebob

3717
06:07:14,299 --> 06:07:19,139
Get with it here

3718
06:07:19,139 --> 06:07:21,139
So, it's all right

3719
06:07:21,220 --> 06:07:24,270
Should I sub a pitcher in or should we keep um part of tostman?

3720
06:07:24,990 --> 06:07:32,400
How's part of tostman doing?

3721
06:07:35,709 --> 06:07:39,810
Can I warm somebody up part of tostman for s knight?

3722
06:07:40,529 --> 06:07:42,689
No, I don't know who that is. That's not a funny character

3723
06:07:43,409 --> 06:07:50,180
No, it has to stay as it has to it has to stay

3724
06:07:51,619 --> 06:07:53,619
As part of toastman, otherwise, it's not a perfect game

3725
06:07:56,610 --> 06:07:59,520
Oh

3726
06:07:59,520 --> 06:08:03,740
Oh shit

3727
06:08:03,740 --> 06:08:08,459
I have to throw a strike because he did turbo mode. All right, we're going we're just going up and in no not um

3728
06:08:09,020 --> 06:08:13,819
Change up down change up down and away. It's the longest you have to wait for a pitch got it

3729
06:08:17,040 --> 06:08:19,040
I'm safe

3730
06:08:19,680 --> 06:08:28,700
I can't throw a ball when he's in turbo mode. All right two strikes

3731
06:08:29,180 --> 06:08:33,919
Are you getting this from curveball in the dirt? It's gonna fucking swing and miss

3732
06:08:35,439 --> 06:08:37,740
I'm not gonna chase that low

3733
06:08:40,000 --> 06:08:42,000
Anything up and in fast?

3734
06:08:47,709 --> 06:08:49,709
Come on b slider get it

3735
06:08:49,790 --> 06:08:52,540
I lose

3736
06:08:52,540 --> 06:09:00,799
It is no perfect game

3737
06:09:02,639 --> 06:09:04,000
Damn it

3738
06:09:04,000 --> 06:09:15,700
How do I how do I pick off?

3739
06:09:18,770 --> 06:09:22,529
Oh, no, I don't get it. No debt wipe. I didn't throw a perfect game

3740
06:09:23,250 --> 06:09:25,549
Of course, it was patrick that did it

3741
06:09:31,020 --> 06:09:34,060
You lost to patrick, you're not adding debt. What do you mean?

3742
06:09:41,040 --> 06:09:44,240
He's lying touch me so bad. He's making errors in the field

3743
06:09:45,040 --> 06:09:47,279
Her bow hit activated. Oh, no. Okay. Um

3744
06:09:48,000 --> 06:10:00,529
Flip finger fastball down and in painting the corners there. That's a strike. I can't get over the gta mod thing

3745
06:10:03,459 --> 06:10:05,360
It's so funny

3746
06:10:05,360 --> 06:10:12,909
One in one count. He's got nothing. I'm going up and in fastball. Let's challenge him

3747
06:10:13,630 --> 06:10:16,189
Inside for a strike

3748
06:10:17,310 --> 06:10:22,909
Okay, keep in mind the flying they used two of their turbos on the flying dutchman and he's gonna swing and miss right now

3749
06:10:25,409 --> 06:10:26,849
absolutely pathetic

3750
06:10:26,849 --> 06:10:28,849
What a waste of two meters

3751
06:10:35,680 --> 06:10:45,659
Only two nothing I can still lose this is gaming. Oh, yeah

3752
06:10:58,209 --> 06:11:02,610
Sponge bob people thought it was spongebob. That's my favorite thing ever

3753
06:11:03,490 --> 06:11:06,990
Down god damn it. I can't believe patrick of all people

3754
06:11:15,330 --> 06:11:20,930
I want to hit a home run stepping in for the second time cj writer. This one is one for one

3755
06:11:21,330 --> 06:11:27,919
To try to get to that ball

3756
06:11:27,919 --> 06:11:31,700
Why did you do that?

3757
06:11:31,700 --> 06:11:35,540
There was someone you could have caught that normally you didn't have to jump across the whole game

3758
06:11:37,150 --> 06:11:39,549
This reminds me of the movie angels in the outfield

3759
06:11:43,500 --> 06:11:48,369
All right. It's all right

3760
06:11:48,369 --> 06:11:58,220
That happens in angels in the outfield advance the third. It's all right. All right. I gotta go on third

3761
06:12:01,060 --> 06:12:04,259
All right wren

3762
06:12:04,259 --> 06:12:08,029
shit

3763
06:12:08,270 --> 06:12:12,299
That's gonna get in there that's gonna get he's fast

3764
06:12:12,540 --> 06:12:17,389
God damn it wren looks. Oh, yeah wren looks like a bug

3765
06:12:18,819 --> 06:12:21,759
Looks like an ant

3766
06:12:36,770 --> 06:12:39,490
I can't believe I didn't get a shutout. That sucks

3767
06:12:40,130 --> 06:12:43,729
Look at all these perfect pitches perfect two-seam fastballs. Nobody can keep up with me

3768
06:12:44,369 --> 06:12:53,490
Let's go change up change up right down the middle let's fucking just let's fuck with them

3769
06:12:54,130 --> 06:13:01,069
Cut out still in yeah, perfect. Yeah, that's what I mean. Perfect game is off

3770
06:13:04,689 --> 06:13:06,689
This is so fun

3771
06:13:07,810 --> 06:13:14,049
So fun and then and then that no simulation. It's not real doesn't have to be real. It's just fun

3772
06:13:22,560 --> 06:13:31,099
Split-fingered out of the way mario super sluggers is better

3773
06:13:31,819 --> 06:13:36,139
They're all good

3774
06:13:36,139 --> 06:13:38,139
You know how much shit you talk with your friends when you play these games

3775
06:13:41,069 --> 06:13:45,549
I got more invested and it was so dead serious and so invested

3776
06:13:46,189 --> 06:13:48,830
Playing these cartoon baseball games against friends on the couch

3777
06:13:49,840 --> 06:14:02,880
Than anything else than any real baseball game. Let's get back to the game mario super strikers makes me livid

3778
06:14:03,520 --> 06:14:09,409
directory here it is

3779
06:14:09,409 --> 06:14:11,009

That game is awesome

3782
06:14:18,060 --> 06:14:21,970
Paint it right on the edge

3783
06:14:23,169 --> 06:14:28,979
I almost have a full meter if I get a full meter is a guaranteed home run

3784
06:14:29,619 --> 06:14:35,659
That's what i'm waiting for

I want to see the whole run. Come on

3791
06:15:19,779 --> 06:15:21,779
That's the only fanfare we get

3792
06:15:21,860 --> 06:15:28,750
You want to do it? I'll do it too

3793
06:15:28,909 --> 06:15:34,590
That bitch was dancing maybe it's time for dinner on a movie you didn't even hit it it doesn't matter

3794
06:15:35,150 --> 06:15:42,819
I hate this guy. Just get rid of him. That's three. Nothing. I'm good

3795
06:15:45,220 --> 06:15:54,540
There's only one more inning kind of fun

06:16:01,220 --> 06:16:06,459
Oh, they're so bad

3797
06:16:07,340 --> 06:16:08,700

06:16:21,340 --> 06:16:25,459

Of course, why does patrick have to ruin everything?

3807
06:17:07,869 --> 06:17:10,799
I was doing so good

3808
06:17:11,040 --> 06:17:14,319
It's not perfect not a perfect game. It's a shutout, but it's not a perfect game

3809
06:17:16,909 --> 06:17:26,619
I want to play another one. I'm gonna play another game. I want to see the other nicktoon characters

3810
06:17:27,340 --> 06:17:39,439
You have to pick a different team

3811
06:17:39,439 --> 06:17:41,520
Or is it just random like a random pool of the characters?

3812
06:17:48,669 --> 06:17:55,790
Here he is patrick

3813
06:17:55,790 --> 06:17:57,150

Postman is rolling right now. Yeah, he is. He's really good

3815
06:18:02,080 --> 06:18:06,880

06:21:42,689 --> 06:21:46,020
To unlock them, maybe

This is like the germa 985 colors

3851
06:21:57,439 --> 06:22:04,540
All right, here we go

3852
06:22:04,540 --> 06:22:06,540

06:22:50,130 --> 06:22:52,470
97 miles per hour only gonna throw fastballs

3859
06:22:53,029 --> 06:23:07,000
Ha let's get back to the action stepping in for the first time today

3860
06:23:09,159 --> 06:23:11,540
Tara

3861
06:23:11,540 --> 06:23:13,939
Katara was available. I didn't know that I didn't see that

3862
06:23:14,419 --> 06:23:26,049
First pitch is a strike

3863
06:23:26,049 --> 06:23:31,169
Damn it. I thought that was gonna be gone

3864
06:23:31,169 --> 06:23:37,439
All right, let's go splitter

3865
06:23:37,439 --> 06:23:39,680
He was right there

3866
06:23:39,680 --> 06:23:41,680
All right, come on sandy

3867
06:23:45,729 --> 06:23:47,729
Home run first pitch I guarantee it

3868
06:23:48,290 --> 06:23:50,849
I guarantee it home run first pitch I guarantee it

3869
06:23:51,490 --> 06:23:58,529
He's in the kill bill outfit

3870
06:24:01,490 --> 06:24:08,770
Why why yeah, why is she dressed like in the kill bill outfit?

3871
06:24:13,189 --> 06:24:15,189
Here's the second pitch

3872
06:24:15,189 --> 06:24:18,069
It's bruce lee. Oh

3873
06:24:21,090 --> 06:24:23,090
Oh, I don't know anything about anything

3874
06:24:27,090 --> 06:24:29,409
All right. Come on fanboy. Here comes cricket

3875
06:24:33,860 --> 06:24:37,080
Here he is his power is terrible

3876
06:24:46,610 --> 06:24:48,610
Alex rodriguez up

3877
06:24:51,139 --> 06:24:53,860
If you have red sox fan, you hate a rod boo him

3878
06:25:09,479 --> 06:25:11,479
If you don't know who alex rodriguez is

3879
06:25:13,840 --> 06:25:16,000
Then we are not in the same generation

3880
06:25:18,279 --> 06:25:21,479
At all i'm probably like i'm probably like 15 plus years older than you

3881
06:25:21,959 --> 06:25:25,270
Which is weird to think about that in it. It's very strange

3882
06:25:32,479 --> 06:25:40,319
I want to unlock the areal monsters who watches sports anymore. I mean I don't

3883
06:25:44,200 --> 06:25:46,520
I did back in 2005

3884
06:25:47,060 --> 06:25:48,599
2004

3885
06:25:48,599 --> 06:26:00,500
I got stimpy this time. Maybe he's got a lot of power

3886
06:26:02,099 --> 06:26:06,080
Nobody can hit this ball. Why is larry the lobster that color?

3887
06:26:09,009 --> 06:26:16,369
Was it red kill bill

3888
06:26:19,009 --> 06:26:21,909
Zero zero zero, this is what a boring game of baseball

3889
06:26:29,779 --> 06:26:41,009
All right, here we go, here's zuko probably shit a lot of power. Yeah, say goodbye way too late

3890
06:26:41,009 --> 06:26:43,650
I don't think that has anything to do with the game

3891
06:26:45,319 --> 06:26:49,000
Oh god damn it. I was he's a stupid 78 mile per hour ball

3892
06:26:51,360 --> 06:26:54,150
Get out of the park. That's gone. See you later

3893
06:26:55,880 --> 06:27:14,919
Holy shit, I can't believe it coming up next scott. It was unbelievable. What's in there?

3894
06:27:16,000 --> 06:27:21,639
Thank you

3895
06:27:21,639 --> 06:27:25,080
That ball was on fire. Yeah, that was going out. That was absolutely out of the park

3896
06:27:27,880 --> 06:27:31,319
Of puppies in the game, but fairly odd parents aren't I think they are

3897
06:27:32,040 --> 06:27:43,569
I think that's just the yeah. Why is larry the lobster looks ridiculous. That looks really just awful

3898
06:27:44,450 --> 06:27:49,540
It looks like a whoopee cushion

3899
06:27:49,540 --> 06:27:58,369
Oh you want to do that? That's fine

3900
06:27:58,369 --> 06:28:01,830
I'll get it right down the middle for you. Look

3901
06:28:10,950 --> 06:28:14,630
I've been waiting a great deal of life for this moment. What is this character from?

3902
06:28:15,270 --> 06:28:20,549
Is this jimmy neutron painting the corners there? That's a strike

3903
06:28:24,360 --> 06:28:28,220
Ladder open it. I think yaks the best picture

3904
06:28:34,099 --> 06:28:39,330
Says it's a ball in tip drag up

3905
06:28:41,169 --> 06:28:46,259
Nobody can keep up with this. I want to check out the tournament after this

3906
06:28:46,340 --> 06:28:53,990
I want to see if I can unlock people

3907
06:28:53,990 --> 06:28:57,889
The yak is juicing

3908
06:28:58,130 --> 06:29:01,490
Yeah, so wouldn't probably every single person you've seen on the screen so far

3909
06:29:02,759 --> 06:29:03,880
real people

3910
06:29:03,880 --> 06:29:07,659
You know back in like 2000 2000 like 2001?

3911
06:29:08,360 --> 06:29:10,360
for like 2006

3912
06:29:11,040 --> 06:29:13,759
Almost every single baseball player was on some kind of drug

3913
06:29:15,720 --> 06:29:18,939
like 1998 to like 2005 2007

3914
06:29:22,130 --> 06:29:24,130
Oh, he looks so weird

3915
06:29:36,369 --> 06:29:40,529
Finally some action

3916
06:29:48,159 --> 06:29:53,430
Larry, all right, let's do i'm going from back to back to back home runs

3917
06:29:54,880 --> 06:29:59,919
He's gonna catch him because he's daddy phantom gonna catch him because he's a daddy phantom. It just sucks

3918
06:30:00,479 --> 06:30:05,139
I don't know. Who is this person? All right, whatever. Whoever you are. You're hitting home run

3919
06:30:08,529 --> 06:30:16,279
back to back

3920
06:30:16,689 --> 06:30:18,049
Take that back

3921
06:30:18,049 --> 06:30:25,759

3922
06:30:26,240 --> 06:30:39,919

3923
06:30:39,919 --> 06:30:41,919
Chip this guy's name is chip monk

06:30:43,959 --> 06:30:48,759
That's three home runs in a row

3925
06:30:48,759 --> 06:30:54,259
Got it

3926
06:30:54,259 --> 06:31:03,000

Let's go for let's do it again that was a different person I might go out

3930
06:31:25,880 --> 06:31:31,700
Oh, no

3931
06:31:33,119 --> 06:31:38,180
They took him out

3932
06:31:38,979 --> 06:31:41,540
Where are all the nicktoon characters? These are all just regular people

3933
06:31:46,040 --> 06:31:48,040
Fuck I got greedy

3934
06:31:50,069 --> 06:31:52,470
How why is there no where are all the nicktoons? All right, there he is

3935
06:32:03,830 --> 06:32:10,310
All right, stop grunting like a weirdo it's nicktoons baseball, you're not like dead lifting 500 pounds

3936
06:32:11,919 --> 06:32:13,919
Settle down. What the fuck is wrong with me?

3937
06:32:16,159 --> 06:32:18,319
This player is over one on the day

3938
06:32:26,180 --> 06:32:28,180
Chill out venom

3939
06:32:31,250 --> 06:32:34,919
Uh, that one hurt that one hurt

3940
06:32:48,419 --> 06:32:54,240
You're a psycho you like fanboy chum chum. I know I didn't hate that show

3941
06:32:56,259 --> 06:33:06,180
I kind of did but I didn't like the john travolta character. I thought was just annoying

3942
06:33:07,119 --> 06:33:09,360
Yeah, the guy who's talking like this he was like a bully

3943
06:33:10,319 --> 06:33:12,319
He was like, you gotta get away from me

3944
06:33:12,560 --> 06:33:14,560
That was really bad john travolta

3945
06:33:14,799 --> 06:33:16,319
whatever

3946
06:33:16,319 --> 06:33:25,220
But that's it. I don't like that character. He was the best. No, it was it was I don't know. I don't like him

3947
06:33:25,700 --> 06:33:29,669
I like chum chum

3948
06:33:29,669 --> 06:33:31,669
Chum chum, I love chum chum's voice

3949
06:33:39,319 --> 06:33:41,430
This show is trash

3950
06:33:41,430 --> 06:33:47,830
That's how I feel internally what you just said about how what you just said

3951
06:33:56,819 --> 06:33:58,819
Down the line. All right, go go go go. That's at least two

3952
06:34:01,400 --> 06:34:05,540
That wasn't

3953
06:34:05,540 --> 06:34:08,340
Remember was a 27 year old man when chum chum first aired

3954
06:34:11,729 --> 06:34:15,700
Right, what was that's pokemon game that you bought?

3955
06:34:26,799 --> 06:34:28,799
Damn it

3956
06:34:32,720 --> 06:34:34,720
Here we go again

3957
06:34:39,040 --> 06:34:44,470
That's it get home home home home home home back back back back. What the fuck was that move?

3958
06:34:44,470 --> 06:34:46,470
Oh

3959
06:34:47,040 --> 06:34:52,240
25 year old relating to I didn't I didn't say I relate to chum chum. I said he thought he was cute

3960
06:34:52,319 --> 06:34:54,319
It was like a cute character

3961
06:34:54,319 --> 06:34:58,000
It's like a little like oh, he's cute. They like they like frosty freezies

3962
06:34:58,880 --> 06:35:02,400
I didn't buy chum chum merchandise. I thought the show was like cute

3963
06:35:07,200 --> 06:35:14,080
I saw like four episodes total. I was sick with the flu one day. Sorry

3964
06:35:29,729 --> 06:35:34,419
Unforgivable

3965
06:35:34,419 --> 06:35:37,860
Don't do that. I'll just do it too. Let's go for a challenge here up and in

3966
06:35:48,319 --> 06:35:51,200
This is it I win the game after this

3967
06:35:51,840 --> 06:35:57,250
He's the guy who says he like cartoons. We're all cheering spongebob right now

3968
06:35:58,279 --> 06:36:00,279
Are we really going to talk about?

3969
06:36:00,279 --> 06:36:02,279
That's not for you old man

3970
06:36:27,729 --> 06:36:29,330
It's a perfect game

3971
06:36:29,330 --> 06:36:31,330
Um, I think it is what?

3972
06:36:31,889 --> 06:36:40,979
There was no bet

3973
06:36:40,979 --> 06:36:42,979
Shit, why didn't I not do it for this game?

3974
06:36:49,919 --> 06:36:51,919
Play it on hard. Okay

3975
06:36:52,159 --> 06:36:57,779
Can I change the difficulty?

3976
06:36:59,060 --> 06:37:01,750
Stinky

3977
06:37:01,750 --> 06:37:04,439
He did just do though

3978
06:37:08,479 --> 06:37:12,400
Oh stop, it's a meme. It's a meme that's been all over the internet

3979
06:37:23,220 --> 06:37:25,299
Just all right, this one's for all the marbles guys

3980
06:37:26,020 --> 06:37:37,779
Okay, this is not all-star we're doing nine innings if I win this game

3981
06:37:38,500 --> 06:37:40,950
I get 500 million off the debt

3982
06:37:41,750 --> 06:37:45,939
If I lose this game

3983
06:37:45,939 --> 06:37:47,700
500 million gets added

3984
06:37:47,700 --> 06:37:54,419
This is it. This is this is a big one

3985
06:37:54,419 --> 06:38:08,159
Okay home team

3986
06:38:08,159 --> 06:38:11,810
I'm gonna be the sonic booms

3987
06:38:12,450 --> 06:38:14,049
versus

3988
06:38:14,049 --> 06:38:18,659
the um

3989
06:38:18,740 --> 06:38:22,279
You know just to make it fair versus like the comeback kids

3990
06:38:22,599 --> 06:38:25,590
Come back kids pick your starting pitcher

3991
06:38:26,310 --> 06:38:35,669
Okay, as is pitch in this game pick your first basement

3992
06:38:41,669 --> 06:38:43,669
All right first baseman's gotta be

3993
06:38:43,830 --> 06:38:49,189
I think i'm gonna take patrick

3994
06:38:49,430 --> 06:38:53,590
Your second face

3995
06:38:53,590 --> 06:38:55,169
Hmm

3996
06:38:55,169 --> 06:38:59,520
Chum chum

3997
06:38:59,520 --> 06:39:01,459
I gotta go with what I want

3998
06:39:01,459 --> 06:39:05,700
Third basement, I would pick danny phantom, but I don't that's I don't like that show

3999
06:39:07,680 --> 06:39:09,680
Third basement gotta have somebody with an arm

4000
06:39:11,619 --> 06:39:13,220
sandy

4001
06:39:13,220 --> 06:39:25,220
Sandy

4002
06:39:25,220 --> 06:39:26,900
No, no

4003
06:39:26,900 --> 06:39:28,180
No arm

4004
06:39:28,180 --> 06:39:30,659
Get third base gotta be somebody with a strong arm. It's gotta be sandy

4005
06:39:32,369 --> 06:39:41,619
Pick your shortstop. I'm ready. This is it. This is the team

4006
06:39:42,340 --> 06:39:46,229
This is the team for me to win this and we're gonna play

4007
06:39:47,189 --> 06:39:49,430
at

4008
06:39:49,430 --> 06:39:53,200
Danny phantom arena

4009
06:39:53,759 --> 06:40:09,000
This is a lot riding on here and this this is an all-star difficulty. We've got nine innings

4010
06:40:14,080 --> 06:40:16,080
Now i'm no longer playing for fun

4011
06:40:21,330 --> 06:40:26,470
All right sponge bob I should have picked sponge bob that was a mistake all right gas has a cutter

4012
06:40:31,669 --> 06:40:33,029
Oh my god

4013
06:40:33,029 --> 06:40:35,270
Gas is even cooler. She throws submarine

4014
06:40:37,299 --> 06:40:39,540
Even cooler. She throws submarine

4015
06:40:40,180 --> 06:40:46,630
And look at the ghost trail

4016
06:40:46,630 --> 06:40:48,959
sinker

4017
06:40:48,959 --> 06:40:51,279
Hey steady diet of sinkers means ground balls all game

4018
06:40:58,450 --> 06:40:59,729
All right, that's two

4019
06:40:59,729 --> 06:41:04,400
Steady diet of sinkers low

4020
06:41:04,560 --> 06:41:08,709
Ground balls all game

4021
06:41:08,709 --> 06:41:15,240
Shit full count

4022
06:41:22,229 --> 06:41:26,610
Victory screwball, you know, you know what a screwball is

4023
06:41:27,009 --> 06:41:29,919
Screwball is a curve ball that goes the other way

4024
06:41:30,560 --> 06:41:33,919
And you have to spin the baseball the other way you have to move your wrist

4025
06:41:34,319 --> 06:41:37,200
You have to flick your wrist to the left if you're a right-handed pitcher

4026
06:41:38,159 --> 06:41:42,880
If you throw a screwball, you just fuck up your elbow. Everybody's ever thrown a screwball has tons of problems

4027
06:41:43,889 --> 06:41:48,130
Because you do with a curve ball you come down and you spin kind of you the ball you spin

4028
06:41:48,290 --> 06:41:50,290
You're to the right side if you're a right-handed pitcher

4029
06:41:51,009 --> 06:41:54,369
You have to flick your wrist like left while you throw as hard as you can

4030
06:41:54,930 --> 06:41:59,330
To have the ball go the other direction a screwball is a curve ball that goes the other way

4031
06:42:01,240 --> 06:42:03,669
It breaks the other way

4032
06:42:03,909 --> 06:42:08,840
It literally fucks up your whole body

4033
06:42:08,840 --> 06:42:15,889
I think there's only like five people in major league baseball that's ever actually thrown a screwball because it's guaranteed to break you

4034
06:42:22,790 --> 06:42:24,790
I don't care about baseball lore

4035
06:42:25,520 --> 06:42:27,040
Oh danny phantom

4036
06:42:27,040 --> 06:42:32,450
Rolled at his head

4037
06:42:32,450 --> 06:42:34,500
Come on computer

4038
06:42:34,500 --> 06:42:36,500
Computer is not one in this game

4039
06:42:38,450 --> 06:42:40,849
Focus I have money on the line. I what about me?

4040
06:42:41,569 --> 06:42:54,560
I got ice stand to want to win this too. Let's get back to the action cutter up and in in the strike zone

4041
06:43:01,430 --> 06:43:04,689
Patrick don't power

4042
06:43:11,439 --> 06:43:13,439
We all have money on the line

4043
06:43:14,840 --> 06:43:17,409
m cannon

4044
06:43:17,409 --> 06:43:22,930
Oh part of toast man is so hard. It's a 70 mile per hour curve ball and it arcs from 12 to six

4045
06:43:24,439 --> 06:43:31,439
Oh, he's so good

4046
06:43:31,439 --> 06:43:33,439
Oh, it's so hard to hit that

4047
06:43:35,459 --> 06:43:36,419
Really?

4048
06:43:36,419 --> 06:43:40,119
Let's go

4049
06:43:40,119 --> 06:43:43,060
No

4050
06:43:43,700 --> 06:43:46,069
That's fine

4051
06:43:51,159 --> 06:44:03,090
The part of toast man's so good, why did I not pick part of toast man? Stop swinging at balls

4052
06:44:05,330 --> 06:44:14,000
That's like being in the corner of boxer and going. Hey, stop getting punched in the face. It's not as easy as you think it is

4053
06:44:23,669 --> 06:44:34,770
It's fine. It's fine. How did you bet on me? You bet on me because i'm gonna win

4054
06:44:35,810 --> 06:44:48,450
How do you dive? How do you dive? How do you dive? I don't know, but I got it

4055
06:44:53,799 --> 06:45:06,150
Oh god, he's so good. He's probably the best character

4056
06:45:17,560 --> 06:45:19,729
It's all right, how do you die?

4057
06:45:20,369 --> 06:45:26,049
I didn't I have to know how to dive

4058
06:45:26,049 --> 06:45:28,740
batting running pitching

4059
06:45:29,459 --> 06:45:45,060
Fielding turbo turbo defense feeling we just dive. I mean, there's definitely a dive. We've seen people do it

4060
06:45:45,380 --> 06:46:01,400
People have done it. We've seen people does it automatic. Is it a it's a button

4061
06:46:02,439 --> 06:46:08,069
Oh, it's action. Okay

4062
06:46:08,069 --> 06:46:13,080
I person person on first we got it. How many else one out?

4063
06:46:14,360 --> 06:46:18,450
Going for a double play writer

4064
06:46:20,930 --> 06:46:26,900
Double play way behind it

4065
06:46:37,599 --> 06:46:45,139
Split it down and in ground ball that pitch is taken counts two and two

4066
06:46:46,259 --> 06:46:47,540
Oh no

4067
06:46:47,540 --> 06:46:49,909
Um, oh shit somebody on base

4068
06:46:57,250 --> 06:47:02,779
Yes, I can't hit anything that was huge

4069
06:47:05,159 --> 06:47:13,639
That was one of the biggest plays the whole game I can do this still okay two outs

4070
06:47:13,639 --> 06:47:15,319
I don't have to worry about a ground ball

4071
06:47:15,319 --> 06:47:17,720
Take a chase

4072
06:47:17,720 --> 06:47:20,529
What do you say? What am I talking to?

4073
06:47:33,360 --> 06:47:36,479
All right, rand's gonna strike out right here, you're gonna leave a man on

4074
06:47:41,759 --> 06:47:43,759
What that's right on the corner that's

4075
06:47:44,159 --> 06:47:54,340
What the fuck is going on? I hate american sports

4076
06:47:56,549 --> 06:47:59,189
What? I mean, this is nicktoons baseball

4077
06:47:59,909 --> 06:48:07,400
It's a little different

4078
06:48:09,009 --> 06:48:14,680
All right, here's all you need to know about american baseball get out

4079
06:48:16,319 --> 06:48:19,439
Go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go slide

4080
06:48:20,630 --> 06:48:23,509
All right. Here we go. This is it. Yeah, nice hit

4081
06:48:24,310 --> 06:48:27,110
Uh pitcher throws ball batter tries to hit ball

4082
06:48:27,990 --> 06:48:30,229
If you catch ball in air batter sit down

4083
06:48:30,950 --> 06:48:33,830
If ball on ground and batter not make two base

4084
06:48:34,470 --> 06:48:36,840
Well, let me hit a fucking home run real quick

4085
06:48:44,290 --> 06:48:48,630
On second i'm not gonna swing at a turbo pitch

4086
06:48:49,430 --> 06:48:52,840
now

4087
06:48:52,840 --> 06:48:54,840
Oh, that could be that's a run

4088
06:48:55,750 --> 06:48:57,750
Come on. You're so slow. Why are you so slow?

4089
06:48:59,380 --> 06:49:00,819
Get the third

4090
06:49:00,819 --> 06:49:02,400
Oh

4091
06:49:02,400 --> 06:49:05,860
Yes in the lead

4092
06:49:11,439 --> 06:49:15,799
How much power do you got? Oh my god, this is huge. This would be it

4093
06:49:18,709 --> 06:49:23,909
Get in there. That's another run. Imagine imagine betting a go to what are you doing?

4094
06:49:24,549 --> 06:49:28,419
What the fuck happened?

4095
06:49:28,419 --> 06:49:32,259
What just happened?

4096
06:49:32,659 --> 06:49:34,659
Why do they go back?

4097
06:49:44,790 --> 06:49:47,270
No, okay, all right, all right, all right, all right, it's it's going out one out

4098
06:49:47,830 --> 06:49:53,270
It's a ball. Don't swing it balls, right?

4099
06:49:57,169 --> 06:49:59,169
Oh, that's so slow. Good thing. I touched it

4100
06:50:03,880 --> 06:50:05,939
No

4101
06:50:05,939 --> 06:50:08,310
Relax, it's fine

4102
06:50:08,310 --> 06:50:10,549
Why did I panic turbo? That was stupid

4103
06:50:16,389 --> 06:50:25,650
Okay

4104
06:50:25,650 --> 06:50:31,459
What are you talking about? I want where's the replay?

4105
06:50:33,400 --> 06:50:41,569
Don't think that has anything to do with the game. I want to see the replay. How did I get?

4106
06:50:41,889 --> 06:50:47,990
Are we there yet? Nobody tagged me. What are you getting this from? Okay. Why does this person have full power in everything?

4107
06:50:48,150 --> 06:50:52,310
They're not even in nicktoon

4108
06:50:52,310 --> 06:50:54,950
Painting the corners there. That's a strike

4109
06:50:55,430 --> 06:51:06,369
All is smashed to deep center, right?

4110
06:51:07,750 --> 06:51:11,990
It's two to one who is that person? Why do they have full power in everything?

4111
06:51:18,849 --> 06:51:22,049
What is going on with this? What is this? What is this?

4112
06:51:23,159 --> 06:51:34,549
full everything

4113
06:51:35,189 --> 06:51:37,189
That's so unfair

4114
06:51:39,029 --> 06:51:51,360
All right, fine. I'm not gonna let it get to me up and in we miss let's get back to the action

4115
06:51:54,799 --> 06:51:57,520
How come they have that that's the two or three people in a row?

4116
06:52:03,560 --> 06:52:05,560
Ha ha ha burritos

4117
06:52:15,830 --> 06:52:17,830
Take a spongebob

4118
06:52:18,790 --> 06:52:23,729
A spongebob is even spongebob has a ton of wait a minute

4119
06:52:25,060 --> 06:52:39,639
I think gaz is tired

4120
06:52:39,639 --> 06:52:43,619
Gaz is tired. All right, we're gonna switch it. Uh, yeah. No, wait a minute

4121
06:52:48,979 --> 06:52:50,979
Is that accurate? It's only this third inning

4122
06:52:51,459 --> 06:52:58,450
There's no time to pretend. No, look at the stars down there. Spongebob has like two extra stars

4123
06:52:59,669 --> 06:53:04,080
Why look at the stars?

4124
06:53:07,650 --> 06:53:15,090
It's because it's on all-star difficulty. Oh, is that what it is?

4125
06:53:16,799 --> 06:53:23,240
Painting the corners there. That's a strike. Well, I don't know. It's the first time I've played on all-star

4126
06:53:30,450 --> 06:53:35,889
This is like insane

4127
06:53:35,889 --> 06:53:37,889
Yeah

4128
06:53:41,119 --> 06:53:43,599
I would use the power up right now, but i'm not gonna I don't have faith

4129
06:53:44,240 --> 06:54:02,290
You're not gonna hit shit

4130
06:54:02,290 --> 06:54:04,290
That was a great pitch too

4131
06:54:04,529 --> 06:54:05,729
down

4132
06:54:05,729 --> 06:54:07,569
Perfect throw cutter

4133
06:54:07,569 --> 06:54:14,130
Look at how bad danny phantom's tv show is even on all-star mode

4134
06:54:14,689 --> 06:54:32,610
look at those stats on the edge people like

4135
06:54:33,750 --> 06:54:36,279
Danny phantom

4136
06:54:36,279 --> 06:54:38,279
I thought danny phantom. I thought people didn't like this show

4137
06:54:39,319 --> 06:54:45,909
How's that a ball?

4138
06:54:45,909 --> 06:54:47,909
Maybe you could use a little rest girl

4139
06:54:48,470 --> 06:54:50,709
Oh my god, how are these balls don't walk anybody?

4140
06:55:06,580 --> 06:55:09,619
Yes, what?

4141
06:55:09,619 --> 06:55:11,619
No, do you know where I put that?

4142
06:55:12,900 --> 06:55:19,430
Oh, come on. All right. I got it's two outs. Just get him. Just hit just get it out

4143
06:55:23,909 --> 06:55:27,349
It's a classic. It's as classic as spider-man dude. All right

4144
06:55:29,479 --> 06:55:31,479
What the fuck did you just do got a third?

4145
06:55:40,369 --> 06:55:43,970
Why what just happened?

4146
06:55:43,970 --> 06:55:48,369
How did you miss that? Oh now it goes the yak. Oh, this is horrible. This is not good

4147
06:55:48,849 --> 06:55:55,240
Someone can get that right

4148
06:55:55,240 --> 06:56:00,520
No

4149
06:56:00,520 --> 06:56:02,759
What the fuck? All right. I gotta lock in next next

4150
06:56:04,049 --> 06:56:06,930
What the hell? How do you hit that ball? It was the dirt

4151
06:56:10,049 --> 06:56:12,959
Please

4152
06:56:12,959 --> 06:56:17,919
It's all right the gates. We're in the third inning everybody sit down and relax patrick's coming up right now

4153
06:56:21,400 --> 06:56:27,029
I swung so late

4154
06:56:27,029 --> 06:56:28,869
Fuck he's throwing so fast

4155
06:56:28,869 --> 06:56:35,509
All right, patrick get us back in the game

4156
06:56:35,509 --> 06:56:38,900
single

4157
06:56:39,799 --> 06:56:49,599
My points my points, it's five to two. It's not like 40 to zero. He didn't get it. He didn't get it

4158
06:56:50,659 --> 06:57:02,419
slide

4159
06:57:02,419 --> 06:57:04,900
No, don't hit do a double play you motherfucker

4160
06:57:05,619 --> 06:57:10,529
Oh shit

4161
06:57:11,169 --> 06:57:13,169
No, all right, everything's fine

4162
06:57:14,130 --> 06:57:17,330
It's the fourth inning. I got a lot. It's a lot of baseball left to play. All right

4163
06:57:23,720 --> 06:57:42,799
Let's get back to the game over the first almost didn't get him get him out of first base

4164
06:57:49,040 --> 06:57:54,659
Yeah

4165
06:58:14,819 --> 06:58:21,340
I'm all right. That was just an emotion that just burst it out of me. Oh my god. It's all falling apart

4166
06:58:32,529 --> 06:58:35,029
Shut up you fucking little weirdo

4167
06:58:43,509 --> 06:58:46,069
Why did you throw it into the stands?

4168
06:58:47,590 --> 06:58:50,950
I have to get a strikeout right now or it's our admin in a lot of trouble

4169
06:59:04,849 --> 06:59:10,930
Shit i'm okay. I i'm may as well be playing sakiro right now. I need to fucking relax

4170
06:59:21,520 --> 06:59:28,470
Yeah, this is gonna she's gonna come out of the game she's too tired

4171
06:59:39,590 --> 06:59:45,479
She's too tired i gotta bring somebody in

4172
06:59:46,689 --> 07:00:06,529
God damn it. I'm just building his meter up. That's right. That's stupid air horn. That's stupid air horn

4173
07:00:17,970 --> 07:00:24,799
Fucking air horn strike out. All right, let's get back to business here

4174
07:00:33,040 --> 07:00:35,040
It's all right, let him waste his meter

4175
07:00:45,759 --> 07:00:52,599
It's all right

4176
07:00:53,409 --> 07:01:02,209
Ah foul ball stay alive. I didn't want to swing. I I wanted to check swing. I tried to check swing

4177
07:01:02,770 --> 07:01:04,770
I tried to check swing and it didn't work

4178
07:01:14,580 --> 07:01:25,720
I hate this. Oh my god. It's part of torspin's impossible to play against he's so good

4179
07:01:33,759 --> 07:01:35,759
All right, come on talk

4180
07:01:48,950 --> 07:01:52,150
You see how insane it is to determine if that's a ball is that a strike or not

4181
07:02:07,159 --> 07:02:09,159
Don't worry. I got this

4182
07:02:09,240 --> 07:02:18,709
Oh my god. Damn it

4183
07:02:19,200 --> 07:02:24,959
Playing against all star back with like difficulty just means they all get like extra stars

4184
07:02:25,439 --> 07:02:30,000
The game's not harder. They just have a fucking 100% more stats than I do

4185
07:02:43,669 --> 07:02:45,970
What happened? No, don't restart the game

4186
07:02:45,970 --> 07:02:47,970
I want to take I gotta take gas out

4187
07:02:49,360 --> 07:02:51,360
Yeah, we're switching gas for e drives

4188
07:02:54,720 --> 07:03:04,869
Oh my god, he sucks, but at least he's fresh

4189
07:03:05,270 --> 07:03:32,770
Now it's one and one that's low and away two and one all right, it's only the fifth inning i'm fine

4190
07:03:34,610 --> 07:03:36,610
I just got to get some contact hits

4191
07:03:36,930 --> 07:03:40,279
It's this fucking character. They have on this team. This guy's in

4192
07:03:41,400 --> 07:03:45,729
This guy's insane. Look at that hot zone

4193
07:03:46,470 --> 07:03:47,509
really

4194
07:03:47,509 --> 07:04:00,419
Swing and a miss strike one

4195
07:04:01,299 --> 07:04:06,119
Outside corner, this is where we get make him greedy. We throw a fastball up and in just out of the zone

4196
07:04:06,119 --> 07:04:12,279
He's gonna freak out. He's just playing that ball exploded. He hit it so hard. Okay. Well new plan

4197
07:04:25,509 --> 07:04:36,759
Two and two swing at it everybody's head and we'll drop in the outfield he's done

4198
07:04:46,069 --> 07:04:51,509
Yeah, okay this guy sucks

4199
07:04:54,630 --> 07:05:00,790
CPU crew it was the bullshit when I threw the ball into the outfield that was when I just went into a total meltdown

4200
07:05:03,299 --> 07:05:06,900
Gas turned around. I went to go pick the guy off and she just threw the ball into the sands

4201
07:05:07,060 --> 07:05:09,060
Like what was that all about?

4202
07:05:16,500 --> 07:05:25,569
It's stepping up player on second two away rent. I don't think rent swings the bat by the way

4203
07:05:26,549 --> 07:05:35,840
I don't think i've seen him swing the bat. I'm screaming. I have homework to do fuck. Okay. He doesn't have a lot of power though

4204
07:05:36,639 --> 07:05:38,720
I kind of uh, what do I should I?

4205
07:05:45,400 --> 07:05:49,040
It's ren. We're fine

4206
07:05:59,060 --> 07:06:03,619
Come on i'm just giving him free meter because they don't swing the goddamn bat

4207
07:06:18,959 --> 07:06:22,529
Okay, I need to get a couple people on base

4208
07:06:23,779 --> 07:06:27,880
I'm not swinging. You gotta pull it that goes across the whole zone

4209
07:06:33,750 --> 07:06:54,259
Take it it's in there. It's not fair. Stop with it

4210
07:06:56,419 --> 07:07:00,180
Stop I feel like i'm watching a donald trump meme video

4211
07:07:07,650 --> 07:07:12,419
That's right down the middle stay at first stay at first

4212
07:07:18,500 --> 07:07:22,020
All right patrick's coming up i'm gonna get a home run right here bang first pitch home run

4213
07:07:29,990 --> 07:07:50,580
I got it back in the game seven to four game ain't over. All right now take him out bench him

4214
07:07:54,630 --> 07:08:05,009
Game's not over. No, it's not not even close breaking ball. I'm not swinging till I get a strike

4215
07:08:07,779 --> 07:08:10,979
That was the okay fine. You want to play that just throw it. I don't care

4216
07:08:11,860 --> 07:08:14,740
action put into these ranking pitches

4217
07:08:15,779 --> 07:08:25,759
Dude burn all your meter. I don't care. You won't have it next inning. It has to throw a strike. Oh my god

4218
07:08:26,720 --> 07:08:37,729
It's in jeff is a mess jeff is a big fat mistake

4219
07:08:40,610 --> 07:08:43,970
I hate that to get that off. I don't want to hear that. I'm gonna keep thinking of those videos

4220
07:08:54,560 --> 07:08:57,599
Oh my god, it was right down the middle. I thought it was going out to the right side of the zone

4221
07:09:00,959 --> 07:09:02,959
Oh my god. All right, it's okay

4222
07:09:06,529 --> 07:09:14,419
Can't wait this little I can't pick another pitcher

4223
07:09:22,229 --> 07:09:27,240
Um, all right, your power is pretty shitty. I'm going curveball down and then he's gonna miss

4224
07:09:29,720 --> 07:09:31,159
Shit, of course

4225
07:09:31,159 --> 07:09:35,639
I got fucking powdered toast man throwing these like monster curveballs that when I do this, I can't hit it

4226
07:09:38,209 --> 07:09:49,279
Uh, that sucks

4227
07:09:50,080 --> 07:10:06,389
I gotta get I gotta get three guys on base and hit grand slam. That's an easy chum chum

4228
07:10:06,389 --> 07:10:07,590
That's an easy play

4229
07:10:07,590 --> 07:10:15,720
You should have picked a better pitcher than who omega lol. No, I should have picked the yak. What was I thinking?

4230
07:10:16,439 --> 07:10:18,840
What was I thinking? I should pick the yak

4231
07:10:22,049 --> 07:10:27,860
I just used my whole meter of what happened was my meters all gone

4232
07:10:29,779 --> 07:10:36,099
What happened wait that uses the whole meter what happened? I'm wait, why is the meter gone? I was saving that

4233
07:10:38,709 --> 07:10:42,790
Turbo uses the actual turbo, but I didn't know that

4234
07:10:50,279 --> 07:10:52,279
I thought that was how to get a dive

4235
07:10:53,240 --> 07:10:55,240
If you hit a home run

4236
07:11:05,200 --> 07:11:12,020
The computer has so much ridiculous stats on all star mode. It's just what the fuck it it is not even possible

4237
07:11:15,279 --> 07:11:18,259
It's not i'm not coming back from this bullshit is impossible

4238
07:11:31,060 --> 07:11:33,060
I'm not quitting. I'm not quitting

4239
07:11:34,659 --> 07:11:47,959
I picked a shit team. I'm doubling down after this i'm picking the the dream team

4240
07:11:54,400 --> 07:12:15,360
From the corner right here

4241
07:12:15,840 --> 07:12:17,840
Oh my god

4242
07:12:27,110 --> 07:12:32,240
All right, can I quit and just take the 500 million? What the fuck dude?

4243
07:12:33,540 --> 07:12:35,540
Why?

4244
07:12:36,099 --> 07:12:38,099
These I can't even

4245
07:12:42,740 --> 07:12:45,220
This is this is absolute blowout now

4246
07:12:47,139 --> 07:12:50,819
Yeah, and why do they hit a home run every fucking single at bat?

4247
07:12:52,049 --> 07:12:54,290
What the fuck are you talking about?

4248
07:12:58,979 --> 07:13:01,279
This one is over three on the day

4249
07:13:07,360 --> 07:13:14,000
Oh shit, that's fucking stupid. Oh even ren from ren and goddamn stimpy is gonna hit a home run

4250
07:13:14,720 --> 07:13:17,919
So is he gonna go around the whole thing?

4251
07:13:35,810 --> 07:13:37,810
Hey, there's still plenty of baseball left. Don't worry

4252
07:13:44,930 --> 07:13:55,880
Fuck this is a close game. It's 15 to 4

4253
07:13:59,970 --> 07:14:03,490
What happened why is everybody have to hit home run every at bat

4254
07:14:04,209 --> 07:14:08,549
Is it because this picture I brought this picture and he sucks. What happened?

4255
07:14:23,319 --> 07:14:26,919
Why I it's not over yet I could still come back and win this

4256
07:14:28,759 --> 07:14:33,799
Okay, that's how you get the fucking that's how you get the juices flowing again catch like that. Let's go

4257
07:14:34,439 --> 07:14:35,639
Here it comes

4258
07:14:35,639 --> 07:14:39,650
Don't swing take a strike

4259
07:14:44,400 --> 07:14:46,479
That shit goes 67 miles per hour

4260
07:14:48,240 --> 07:14:55,750
This bitch is just so slow. This bitch is just so slow. You can't it's impossible

4261
07:15:05,569 --> 07:15:09,490
I gotta I gotta pick powder toast man. If i'm gonna double down. I gotta pick powder toast man first

4262
07:15:10,049 --> 07:15:13,830
This guy goes from like 95 to 65

4263
07:15:19,380 --> 07:15:21,380
Still got thrown out. No, he didn't. Okay, i'm good

4264
07:15:27,139 --> 07:15:30,529
Finally, he's out of the game

4265
07:15:33,090 --> 07:15:42,159
I quit i'll take the loss. I lose that's 500 million. I'm literally just calling the team back

4266
07:15:46,580 --> 07:15:56,389
Call the team back slaughter rule games over probably nothing. This is for a billion. I'm going to the boppers

4267

4268
07:16:17,060 --> 07:16:19,060
Yak pitcher don't take powder toast man

First base man, we're gonna do i'm i'm getting part of toast man the fuck off

4270
07:16:24,979 --> 07:16:26,819
Of this goddamn list

07:16:26,819 --> 07:16:29,060
Bunch box pitching. All right

4272
07:16:29,759 --> 07:16:40,849
Locked in my two favorite players. Toph was good. We're going tough

4273
07:16:42,880 --> 07:16:43,759
No

4274
07:16:43,759 --> 07:16:45,759
No, i've refused to pick. I don't want dandy phantom

4275
07:16:53,459 --> 07:16:57,040
Pick your third basement

4276
07:16:57,200 --> 07:16:59,090
dandy

4277
07:16:59,090 --> 07:17:07,159
Stop getting a wild card in there flying dutchman. Let's go

4278
07:17:10,389 --> 07:17:15,240
Stadium

4279
07:17:15,240 --> 07:17:17,240
I'm going for a total wild card here

4280
07:17:17,319 --> 07:17:23,479
This is for a billion added or a billion off and i'm not i'm done after this. This is the real one

4281
07:17:24,119 --> 07:17:29,380
Let's get this one started. Here's patrick star

4282
07:17:30,180 --> 07:17:35,540
The patrick is here strike one good start

4283
07:17:43,000 --> 07:17:45,159
Really good start now. We slow it down go out of the strike zone

4284
07:17:50,790 --> 07:17:59,450
That's a strike. Let's get back to the game. That's on the corner

4285
07:17:59,450 --> 07:18:07,639
There

4286
07:18:17,270 --> 07:18:19,110
Yak is unbelievable

4287
07:18:19,110 --> 07:18:33,740
Nobody can hit this

4288
07:18:33,740 --> 07:18:35,590
97 miles per hour

4289
07:18:35,590 --> 07:18:37,590
I gotta get a strike out. Let's do slider

4290
07:18:37,669 --> 07:18:40,310
I'm gonna do split fastball down where he likes it

4291
07:18:40,950 --> 07:18:43,700
And entice him to swing in this

4292
07:18:45,959 --> 07:18:48,200
He just got these pure this massive brain

4293
07:18:50,409 --> 07:18:59,759
What the hell is this? I thought that was olive oil for a second from pup eye. I was like, that's not nickelodeon

4294
07:19:16,970 --> 07:19:21,639
Is one and one

4295
07:19:21,880 --> 07:19:23,000
again

4296
07:19:23,000 --> 07:19:26,119
Can't hit the fast stuff. We're going to split it down out of the strike zone swinging a mess

4297
07:19:28,759 --> 07:19:34,779
Oh it injured can they get injured

4298
07:19:39,400 --> 07:19:45,340
All right, you can't you they're gonna get a hit sorry is it this two outs it's fine

4299
07:20:06,500 --> 07:20:10,020
There it is sandy cheeks, what a fucking what happened did I get him? Okay. Yeah, I got him

4300
07:20:11,159 --> 07:20:14,040
That was a beautiful play by sandy that's why you have sandy at third base every time

4301
07:20:18,360 --> 07:20:23,610
Out of toast may lead us off with a nice single

4302
07:20:24,860 --> 07:20:26,860
No, don't go for two. Don't be stupid

4303
07:20:32,919 --> 07:20:34,919
This guy has terrible stats

4304
07:20:42,419 --> 07:20:45,619
Don't throw no double play no double play. Thank god

4305
07:20:46,419 --> 07:20:56,099
Spongebob, it's kind of hard to get the rainbow trail. It's really important. It's kind of hard to see

4306
07:21:00,389 --> 07:21:02,389
Oh my god, it's hard to see his pitch

4307
07:21:12,459 --> 07:21:15,259
Take it

4308
07:21:15,259 --> 07:21:20,169
100 miles per hour way behind

4309
07:21:21,770 --> 07:21:26,180
97 it's in there

4310
07:21:35,860 --> 07:21:44,040
Earth's pitch is a strike. I was spongebob throwing faster than the yak

4311
07:21:55,639 --> 07:22:01,000
Get it in sorry turn double play i'm gonna go with sinking sinking balls down the middle of zone

4312
07:22:02,520 --> 07:22:07,080
It's coming up. All right, we're gonna do split finger. Yeah, turn this double play. This guy sucks

4313
07:22:07,639 --> 07:22:11,099
Not even a nicktoon get out of here

4314
07:22:11,099 --> 07:22:20,330
Not even a nicktoon

4315
07:22:20,330 --> 07:22:23,369
It's that one. There it is. There it is. Nice job tough

4316
07:22:27,240 --> 07:22:31,720
Danny phantom's fast go for two go for second base. Don't try to get a double play

4317
07:22:32,119 --> 07:22:43,479
Can we get a girl out of here? Like how do I just remove girl from the game?

4318
07:22:48,259 --> 07:22:51,020
All right. Now I can play around a little bit here

4319
07:22:51,020 --> 07:22:53,020
Going right down here with a split

4320
07:22:57,139 --> 07:22:59,139
No

4321
07:23:07,750 --> 07:23:09,750
That was so close

4322
07:23:15,060 --> 07:23:20,250
Okay

4323
07:23:21,799 --> 07:23:30,180
I gotta get a strike out

4324
07:23:30,180 --> 07:23:32,340
Not gonna let you fuck with me on that one, buddy

4325
07:23:33,540 --> 07:23:48,619
Split her out of the zone swinging this one. All right. All right, whatever

4326
07:24:19,959 --> 07:24:42,490
What the fuck hold on I wait, oh my god, that was so stupid

4327
07:24:44,250 --> 07:24:50,060
Who's the catcher? Oh my god, that sucks

4328
07:24:53,479 --> 07:25:00,310
What the fuck it's cartoon baseball. Yeah, nobody punched it. Nobody attacked me, buddy

4329
07:25:03,400 --> 07:25:05,700
Okay, I have to uh

4330
07:25:06,180 --> 07:25:09,130
I need to relax

4331
07:25:09,130 --> 07:25:11,779
I gotta relax

4332
07:25:11,779 --> 07:25:14,650
That was so stupid

4333
07:25:14,729 --> 07:25:25,610
That motherfucker is out for the inside corner strike three. Come on don't do it

4334
07:25:46,060 --> 07:25:47,900
Patrick

4335
07:25:47,900 --> 07:26:07,580
That's a strike

4336
07:26:07,580 --> 07:26:16,979
Oh, okay strike two up and in fastball. Perfect throw. Let's go bingo. Oh, all right. It's only one run. I'm fine

4337
07:26:17,540 --> 07:26:24,500
Stepping in for the first time today. I'll swing to get a strike. That's what we did in little league

4338
07:26:28,599 --> 07:26:30,979
Wait a minute

4339
07:26:30,979 --> 07:26:32,500
Did you see that?

4340
07:26:32,500 --> 07:26:35,779
If you throw in their hot zone you get turbo if they if they miss

4341
07:26:36,580 --> 07:26:41,779
Did you see that shit?

4342
07:26:41,779 --> 07:26:45,290
Don't risk it

4343
07:26:54,680 --> 07:27:00,069
All right, that's it just I want to advance the runner flying dutchman

4344
07:27:00,869 --> 07:27:05,020
This is it

4345
07:27:06,060 --> 07:27:08,220
That's right down the middle that's a home no, it's not stay back

4346
07:27:08,860 --> 07:27:25,500
Stepping in don't swing. Oh my god. Oh my goodness

4347
07:27:27,180 --> 07:27:33,099
You gotta be fucking kidding me I swung at the perfect time

4348
07:27:39,299 --> 07:27:42,580
Oh my god, it goes fucking 60 miles per hour

4349
07:27:45,880 --> 07:27:50,279
High game dutchman down. What are you doing?

4350
07:27:51,479 --> 07:27:56,520
Why would you run for third? I didn't tell you to do that. You didn't even slide you fucking ghost imbecile

4351
07:27:57,740 --> 07:28:02,139
What an idiot. I didn't tell him to do that and he didn't even slide. I was smashing a

4352
07:28:25,529 --> 07:28:38,900
I get turbo for that

4353
07:28:49,459 --> 07:28:57,979
It's all right is he even trying it's a one-to-one game on i'm playing in the hardest difficulty. What are you talking about?

4354
07:29:14,020 --> 07:29:16,650
All right, well no, uh, they have some way to turn down play

4355
07:29:17,610 --> 07:29:19,610
Okay, we're gonna go double play time

4356
07:29:28,599 --> 07:29:30,599
Ignoring the runner

4357
07:30:03,180 --> 07:30:05,740
That's a strike it's right in the zone, what are you talking about?

4358
07:30:12,459 --> 07:30:15,099
I cannot let them do that. No way

4359
07:30:22,279 --> 07:30:23,560
Fuck you

4360
07:30:23,560 --> 07:30:29,189
No, he's gonna get meter

4361
07:30:33,610 --> 07:30:45,419
Powder toast man, you suck. How come like spongebob will jump 40 feet in the air and catch that ball

4362
07:30:48,409 --> 07:30:50,409
They dive across the whole game

4363
07:30:50,569 --> 07:30:56,840
He just did a daria. Oh, whoops. Why does he not launch across the whole game?

4364
07:30:57,959 --> 07:30:59,959
Like the spongebob guy does

4365
07:31:07,459 --> 07:31:09,459
Um

4366
07:31:12,900 --> 07:31:15,939
I can't believe it. Why does it have to keep happening?

4367
07:31:17,930 --> 07:31:27,080
It's not fair

4368
07:31:27,080 --> 07:31:31,560
Okay after like the for their third inning they just start hitting every single ball

4369
07:31:44,310 --> 07:31:58,150
It ain't over yet. Don't let it get out of control. Let's get back to the action

4370
07:32:04,419 --> 07:32:06,840
Okay, here we go I need base runners

4371
07:32:12,939 --> 07:32:16,580
I'm not swinging until I get a strike

4372
07:32:17,220 --> 07:32:19,220
That's turbo times three

4373
07:32:19,220 --> 07:32:25,130
Let him walk me in four pitches. Oh my god. I knew what I was doing too. Why would you swing?

4374
07:32:32,060 --> 07:32:34,060
I was about to scream in the microphone

4375
07:32:38,650 --> 07:32:52,439
Come on fill up that meter. I need it. How's that a foul ball? I was just perfect

4376
07:32:57,049 --> 07:33:01,340
Give me something to hit

4377
07:33:03,580 --> 07:33:10,700
The visitors have their work look at that little rinky dink bullshit hit

4378
07:33:11,500 --> 07:33:18,380
That was terrible

4379
07:33:18,380 --> 07:33:20,380
Oh foul ball. Come on

4380
07:33:25,900 --> 07:33:28,459
I gotta string something together. I gotta get people on base

4381
07:33:48,779 --> 07:33:51,099
Four runs is okay. I can deal with four runs

4382
07:33:52,310 --> 07:33:57,340
Should be an easy play and right one two three inning one two three one two three one two three

4383
07:33:57,819 --> 07:34:04,919
I got it. I'm good

4384
07:34:11,259 --> 07:34:13,259
That's a strike give me a break

4385
07:34:14,220 --> 07:34:16,619
I gotta fill up that meter and i'll spring together five hits

4386
07:34:17,500 --> 07:34:27,400
All right, come on

4387
07:34:29,880 --> 07:34:34,299
I thought that was a home run. I was like no way

4388
07:34:37,479 --> 07:34:42,360
Here comes the pitch taken for a ball. You know, the computer is stupid

4389
07:34:42,680 --> 07:35:04,119
Nobody takes that if i'm playing against another person they're swinging. It was scary, but I got it

4390
07:35:05,240 --> 07:35:07,319
I got three meters right now

4391
07:35:09,430 --> 07:35:11,110
down by four runs

4392
07:35:11,110 --> 07:35:13,189
We just don't just let him throw it don't even swing

4393
07:35:15,060 --> 07:35:18,659
But i'm wasted I got almost four of these damn things don't swing

4394
07:35:19,959 --> 07:35:22,680
Second pitch taken for ball two do not swing till I get a strike

4395
07:35:26,619 --> 07:35:28,619
Don't do it

4396
07:35:28,619 --> 07:35:30,880
Don't swing under any circumstance

4397
07:35:43,290 --> 07:35:47,659
All right, I got somebody on base and I have four charges let's go

4398
07:35:51,430 --> 07:35:54,790
Oh my god, if you hit into a double play, I will scream. Thank god

4399
07:35:57,319 --> 07:36:14,709
All right, don't swing till I get a strike that's down the line. All right. All right. All right, dude. Here we go

4400
07:36:15,750 --> 07:36:18,150
I can get to what I can make it a one run game

4401
07:36:19,240 --> 07:36:21,240
flying dutchman

4402
07:36:23,610 --> 07:36:32,700
Or just the one run game five to four. I got this I can do this

4403
07:36:33,340 --> 07:36:36,220
I still got meter too

4404
07:36:38,150 --> 07:36:49,270
Yes, all right. We're back in this i'll swing till I get a strike. I need base runners again

4405
07:36:51,750 --> 07:36:54,020
That's okay

4406
07:36:54,020 --> 07:36:56,380
I'm about to take the lead

4407
07:36:56,380 --> 07:36:58,380
I gotta get it done, right?

4408
07:36:59,540 --> 07:37:01,540
I don't even know who the fuck you are, but you're hitting a home run

4409
07:37:03,880 --> 07:37:11,560
I win six. I just took the lead

4410
07:37:12,200 --> 07:37:14,200
Six four six five. Let's go

4411
07:37:22,490 --> 07:37:24,490
Yeah, sponge bobby

4412
07:37:24,729 --> 07:37:27,049
And powder toast man coming up his contacts the best in the whole game

4413
07:37:27,849 --> 07:37:34,580
Don't swing

4414
07:37:34,580 --> 07:37:36,580
That's gonna be a tricky play no matter who you are

4415
07:37:37,139 --> 07:37:42,419
whatever

4416
07:37:46,810 --> 07:37:50,810
That sounded way more powerful than it was all right, we made some good progress here

4417
07:37:53,430 --> 07:38:02,169
It is don't blow it matters one for two. It's the outside corner

4418
07:38:04,020 --> 07:38:12,409
Stay strong. I'm I am I think I got this I just have to play smart already in the hole strike three

4419
07:38:31,369 --> 07:38:36,740
Sorry

4420
07:38:47,560 --> 07:38:50,180
Stupid air horn

4421
07:38:56,680 --> 07:39:07,029
Zim is there in time and has a base hit get upset computer down. Let's get back. I want to throw the third

4422
07:39:07,029 --> 07:39:10,950
Look, he's halfway down the baseline. I want I want to throw a third base

4423
07:39:12,409 --> 07:39:14,409
What why can't I throw the third base?

4424
07:39:14,569 --> 07:39:19,080
Look at him. I can't throw the third base

4425
07:39:32,779 --> 07:39:34,779
Like where's my I can't throw the race

4426
07:39:46,950 --> 07:39:48,950
Oh god, thank goodness

4427
07:39:58,069 --> 07:40:00,069
Yes double play sit down

4428
07:40:02,630 --> 07:40:23,110
Oh shit

4429
07:40:23,509 --> 07:40:25,509
Are you perfect in a row I have to

4430
07:40:31,099 --> 07:40:36,139
That's good enough for me. All right, this is it. That's what i'm pitching out of a jam. That's what I like to say

4431
07:40:36,459 --> 07:40:51,540
It's not a ball

4432
07:41:01,020 --> 07:41:08,459
Strike him up right here. This is it same place up and in challenge him. That's a strike

4433
07:41:15,990 --> 07:41:28,119
I have i'm going for it. I have to I need to secure the strikeout. That was a strategic place to do that

4434
07:41:30,250 --> 07:41:32,250
He gets a base hit. It's high game

4435
07:41:32,569 --> 07:41:38,580
This hitter is old for two don't say that

4436
07:41:41,880 --> 07:41:43,880
66 mile per hour goddamn changeup

4437
07:41:50,860 --> 07:41:57,590
Let's get back to the action. All right, he's gonna throw two balls in a row. I think good

4438
07:42:08,439 --> 07:42:11,880
Oh they they wha hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, what is

4439
07:42:12,520 --> 07:42:15,639
Excuse me. Who's this random guy that has all

4440
07:42:16,840 --> 07:42:18,119
Everything is maxed

4441
07:42:18,119 --> 07:42:19,880
Who the fuck is this person?

4442
07:42:19,880 --> 07:42:31,560
What let's get back to the game. Whatever

4443
07:42:32,709 --> 07:42:35,349
Are you serious? All right, I just gotta I almost have a meter

4444
07:42:39,979 --> 07:42:42,939
Oh my god the arc on that curve

4445
07:42:47,639 --> 07:42:51,529
mvp right here

4446
07:42:51,529 --> 07:42:57,419
That's a comfortable lead

4447
07:42:57,419 --> 07:43:03,259
Okay, I can't lose. I got they they scored like 15 runs in one inning. I have to be very careful

4448
07:43:05,659 --> 07:43:15,830
Don't get confident

4449
07:43:21,430 --> 07:43:24,889
Don't just hold off

4450
07:43:24,889 --> 07:43:26,970
All right, just let him throw it out and throw it in the dirt. I don't care

4451
07:43:27,689 --> 07:43:29,939
What a waste of turbo

4452
07:43:29,939 --> 07:43:32,950
Must be all-star just take the next pitch

4453
07:43:33,509 --> 07:43:39,029
Whatever. That's all right

4454
07:43:39,029 --> 07:43:41,029
Holy shit, that's so slow

4455
07:43:41,659 --> 07:43:44,630
It's so slow

4456
07:43:44,630 --> 07:43:46,630
flying dutchman

4457
07:43:53,909 --> 07:43:55,909
Wow

4458
07:43:56,389 --> 07:43:58,069
Are you kidding me

4459
07:43:58,069 --> 07:44:01,029
That's huge if I take a couple of balls, I might get another home run

4460
07:44:07,419 --> 07:44:08,700
Give me a meter

4461
07:44:08,700 --> 07:44:10,700
Come on throw another ball out of the dirt

4462
07:44:13,290 --> 07:44:15,290
All right. All right. All right. All right

4463
07:44:16,389 --> 07:44:19,029
Oh, fuck you. That was out of the strike zone. Whatever

4464
07:44:25,560 --> 07:44:28,459
It's I don't get that call

4465
07:44:36,180 --> 07:44:37,299
Okay

4466
07:44:37,299 --> 07:44:39,700
I think I gotta pull out. Uh, I think I gotta pull them

4467
07:44:40,500 --> 07:44:52,360
Oh shit. He actually missed he actually missed

4468
07:45:07,080 --> 07:45:09,080
Get that ball

4469
07:45:09,400 --> 07:45:12,540
That's okay

4470
07:45:12,540 --> 07:45:16,819
We're going home if it's a ground ball

4471
07:45:17,639 --> 07:45:20,970
Keep that in mind

4472
07:45:20,970 --> 07:45:39,380
Ground ball we go home

4473
07:45:39,380 --> 07:45:44,020
Flying dutchman, what in the name of god did you just do that for?

4474
07:45:44,900 --> 07:45:48,020
It was in front of you it's right in front of you

4475
07:46:00,659 --> 07:46:11,220
Oh my god swing that get up

4476
07:46:15,099 --> 07:46:23,259
Okay, we're good everything's fine he's got to come out next inning he cannot pitch in the seventh inning

4477
07:46:38,869 --> 07:46:40,869
There it is. All right, strike him out

4478
07:46:53,220 --> 07:46:55,220
I think I gotta pull him

4479
07:46:56,099 --> 07:46:59,060
I gotta pull him. I think one more batter

4480
07:47:02,310 --> 07:47:04,310
No

4481
07:47:42,970 --> 07:47:45,049
Oh my god, this pitcher sucks

4482
07:47:45,770 --> 07:47:51,529
So much they're gonna hit every single ball. They're gonna hit every single ball

4483
07:47:52,409 --> 07:47:57,549
He's terrible. I don't get six stars in every single category

4484
07:47:59,419 --> 07:48:03,180
I don't how are you supposed to do a nine inning game at nicktoons mlb versus all-star team?

4485
07:48:03,819 --> 07:48:08,900
He doesn't come in with five stars in every category

4486
07:48:19,099 --> 07:48:21,659
Easy play dutchman. Come on. All right, that's it

4487
07:48:22,860 --> 07:48:25,259
I can do this

4488
07:48:25,259 --> 07:48:28,700
I can do this. All right, here we go. He look this pitch is better than sponge bob

4489
07:48:29,340 --> 07:48:36,229
The fuck is this fair?

4490
07:48:44,380 --> 07:48:48,790
You

4491
07:48:57,860 --> 07:49:09,909
Went right into the hot zone, of course he did I gotta get somebody on base powder tostman. It's gotta be you

4492
07:49:21,700 --> 07:49:24,580
Beat it out beat it out beat it out beat it out beat it out beat it out beat it out

4493
07:49:37,979 --> 07:49:41,479
They're gonna hit everything I shouldn't pull the even though the all the yak sucks

4494
07:49:42,119 --> 07:49:50,680
I don't think I should have pulled them

4495
07:49:50,680 --> 07:49:52,119
All right, that's good

4496
07:49:52,119 --> 07:49:55,700
You better catch that

4497
07:50:18,180 --> 07:50:22,340
They're gonna hit everything why it sucks

4498
07:50:29,560 --> 07:50:31,560
It's not out of reach I can still do it

4499
07:50:39,830 --> 07:50:42,229
It's only three run game. We're good. Everybody relax

4500
07:50:50,299 --> 07:50:53,369
this is like

4501
07:50:54,330 --> 07:50:55,849
They just have

4502
07:50:55,849 --> 07:50:57,369
like I it's

4503
07:50:57,450 --> 07:51:01,610
It's not possible to play a nine inning game in this game against all-star team

4504
07:51:06,860 --> 07:51:13,610
They're gonna hit fucking home runs every other at bat. I can't even pull this pitcher. You only get two

4505
07:51:14,950 --> 07:51:21,939
What I can't even pull this guy

4506
07:51:29,909 --> 07:51:32,090
God damn it

4507
07:51:41,000 --> 07:51:44,040
I was up to and I had to switch my pitchers because you have to

4508
07:51:44,680 --> 07:51:49,159
And and now they're just gonna get a fucking great contact with every single at bat

4509
07:51:52,229 --> 07:51:54,229
Here's how germa can still win

4510
07:51:55,720 --> 07:52:03,340
That's not even a ball i'm not he gets those calls that's unfair he gets those fucking calls

4511
07:52:21,380 --> 07:52:36,169
I need five runs. I need so much more power somebody just fucking strangle that little guy

4512
07:52:41,849 --> 07:52:44,169
Turn it. All right, that's how you do it. Let's go

4513
07:52:51,720 --> 07:52:54,680
And they have this guy how does this any fucking fair

4514
07:52:55,400 --> 07:53:11,720
Why does this guy have max sponge bob didn't even have max stats?

4515
07:53:20,740 --> 07:53:23,110
All right, here we go

4516
07:53:32,090 --> 07:53:35,849
All right. All right. All right. Everybody relax. We've got three men on base. I got one out

4517
07:53:38,090 --> 07:53:41,400
This guy has no

4518
07:53:41,400 --> 07:53:43,240
Okay. All right. This is it

4519
07:53:43,240 --> 07:53:48,169
No, not swing till I get a strike. I'm gonna get I'm gonna get power. I'm gonna fucking bring this back

4520
07:53:58,069 --> 07:54:03,020
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha what just fucking happened?

4521
07:54:03,659 --> 07:54:05,580
The game is broken

4522
07:54:05,580 --> 07:54:10,459
This is a broken video game. This is a broken video game. That was a double fucking play

4523
07:54:11,419 --> 07:54:13,979
This is a video game. You're not supposed to win. It's impossible to win all star

4524
07:54:15,930 --> 07:54:19,610
What I don't understand what happened

4525
07:54:19,610 --> 07:54:22,970
She lagged for a second and instantly teleported to the ball

4526
07:54:23,770 --> 07:54:25,770
And then apparently tagged the guy out at third base

4527
07:54:31,299 --> 07:54:38,599
It hit the runner. No, she caught it. She caught the dumb

4528
07:54:58,180 --> 07:55:00,180
You suck dutchman

4529
07:55:03,509 --> 07:55:24,970
Is now two for the eighth double looks the runner back silly girl

4530
07:55:27,130 --> 07:55:36,630
That's not a ball and I know it just get the sure out don't do anything stupid

4531
07:55:36,630 --> 07:55:39,590
I could have gone I couldn't do that a two to six to one double play whatever it was

4532
07:55:41,560 --> 07:55:43,560
He's gonna activate his power too, isn't he?

4533
07:55:45,220 --> 07:55:47,139
I have to he has to hit the ball. Let him hit it

4534
07:55:48,020 --> 07:55:52,099
No, let him hit the ball hit it. Don't activate your power before i'm gonna do before he can fucking do anything

4535
07:55:54,939 --> 07:55:56,939
Don't let him activate the power just pitch right away

4536
07:56:10,919 --> 07:56:12,919
I didn't want to activate the power

4537
07:56:28,580 --> 07:56:30,580
It's over oh come on

4538
07:56:31,750 --> 07:56:37,669

4541
07:56:50,470 --> 07:57:02,200

07:58:49,669 --> 07:58:56,139

08:04:53,209 --> 08:04:55,209
Give me a break you motherfucker

4594
08:04:56,169 --> 08:05:04,360
What happened? I'm not done. Let's go

4595
08:05:07,770 --> 08:05:09,770
Now that was such horseshit

4596
08:05:10,250 --> 08:05:21,049
They're just hitting every fucking ball

4597
08:05:21,049 --> 08:05:27,369
That's insane. It's insane that they can do this back-to-back home runs on fucking contact swings

4598
08:05:28,409 --> 08:05:36,119
I gotta get a double play right now

4599
08:05:36,119 --> 08:05:39,450
Do not let him on base

4600
08:05:40,939 --> 08:05:42,299
Oh my god

4601
08:05:42,299 --> 08:05:45,849
It's unraveling

4602
08:05:45,930 --> 08:05:52,860
Fucking unraveling. Oh this game sucks. This game sucks

4603
08:05:54,459 --> 08:05:57,099
What a piece of shit game i'm so mad

4604
08:06:00,200 --> 08:06:03,159
And the fucking cpu gets extra goddamn power

4605
08:06:17,450 --> 08:06:21,290
I was gonna win the game too, but this fucking cpu

4606
08:06:21,990 --> 08:06:23,450
bullshit

4607
08:06:23,450 --> 08:06:25,450
They all get maximum stats

4608
08:06:26,090 --> 08:06:27,849
Who made this game?

4609
08:06:27,849 --> 08:06:29,290
How dare you?

4610
08:06:29,290 --> 08:06:35,159
I can't even change this picture out and I can't throw a fucking strike even if I put it in the middle of the zone

4611
08:06:35,720 --> 08:06:45,830
And catch up with that was not where I put that fucking ball. This guy sucks absolute asshole

4612
08:06:50,150 --> 08:06:52,150
That's not even where I put that pitch

4613
08:07:12,099 --> 08:07:15,849
Fuck you game

4614
08:07:15,849 --> 08:07:18,729
That's such bullshit. I had it with powder toast man, but the guy

4615
08:07:19,130 --> 08:07:23,689
Oh, i'm gonna throw them all it's gonna start at the top of the fucking screen and it's gonna end up at the bottom of the screen

4616
08:07:24,950 --> 08:07:39,639
Isn't that fun?

4617
08:07:39,639 --> 08:07:44,119
And then I don't make that catcher. I can't make that catcher the computer will

4618
08:08:03,860 --> 08:08:09,479
Have I have I I don't you know what i'm gonna say, how's that not a strike for me, but it's a strike for him

4619
08:08:10,040 --> 08:08:21,529
This is a game is dog shit

4620
08:08:24,779 --> 08:08:31,419
I like that. Look look my picture is so tired. It's gonna spring together a million fucking hits. I can't even do anything

4621
08:08:33,500 --> 08:08:35,740
Who is the fucking moron?

4622
08:08:36,380 --> 08:08:40,299
That thought that you shouldn't be able to switch out more than one pitcher in the whole game

4623
08:08:40,779 --> 08:08:45,020
And listen to my voice going like this. How what how could you be so stupid?

4624
08:08:45,259 --> 08:08:48,459
Why can't why can you only switch one pitcher in nine innings?

4625
08:08:49,909 --> 08:08:51,909
Are you insane?

4626
08:08:51,990 --> 08:09:09,979
Like I can't even do anything

4627
08:09:10,299 --> 08:09:15,419
I I can't this guy this pitcher is apparently so tired. I can't do anything

4628
08:09:16,060 --> 08:09:17,930
And wait a minute

4629
08:09:17,930 --> 08:09:19,930
Didn't he change pitchers twice?

4630
08:09:20,250 --> 08:09:23,319
He did didn't he he changed pitches twice?

4631
08:09:25,619 --> 08:09:29,529
What?

4632
08:09:29,529 --> 08:09:33,369
Like I have to throw a strike eventually and he fucking hits it out of the park

4633
08:09:34,009 --> 08:09:45,159
Oh my god

4634
08:09:46,500 --> 08:09:50,900
Yeah, it was 15 15 that started the ending and they hit a fucking base hit

4635
08:09:51,619 --> 08:09:54,020
Every time they made contact with the fucking bad

4636
08:10:01,529 --> 08:10:04,409
I

4637
08:10:07,779 --> 08:10:09,779
Is this a child in right field

4638
08:10:10,580 --> 08:10:14,099
Is this a kid in right field? He's missed every single one of those

4639
08:10:15,610 --> 08:10:20,889
This has to be an eight-year-old in the fucking right field has to be this person's six years old over there

4640
08:10:37,130 --> 08:10:42,250
This was so intense. What a fucking storybook ending this would have been but I forgot the game's terrible

4641
08:10:42,650 --> 08:10:47,930
Ah

4642
08:10:47,930 --> 08:10:49,930
Where's my storybook ending?

4643
08:10:50,409 --> 08:10:55,369
30 runs there are 30 fucking runs. I can't stop it

4644
08:10:55,770 --> 08:10:58,409
It doesn't matter what I do. They're gonna hit the ball every time

4645
08:11:00,439 --> 08:11:02,840
Oh my god, can I finally fucking play?

4646
08:11:04,439 --> 08:11:06,439
What the fuck

4647
08:11:09,560 --> 08:11:21,060
Oh, that's such bullshit. Why do they hit every single fucking ball?

4648
08:11:22,180 --> 08:11:23,380
that's

4649
08:11:23,919 --> 08:11:35,720
Unbelievably stupid that throws a hundred fucking miles per hour

4650
08:11:40,009 --> 08:11:41,849
He throws a hundred

4651
08:11:41,849 --> 08:11:48,009
And then the next pitch is a fucking like a curve ball that goes 50 miles per hour and arcs across the whole screen

4652
08:11:52,459 --> 08:11:54,939
Why are then why are there non-cartoon characters in this game?

4653
08:11:58,840 --> 08:12:00,840
That went 60 miles per hour

4654
08:12:05,689 --> 08:12:07,689
Going from 100 to 60

4655
08:12:09,340 --> 08:12:16,759
I'm breaking this disc in half

4656
08:12:16,840 --> 08:12:19,080

4718
08:21:25,000 --> 08:21:27,560
Don't swing

08:21:32,779 --> 08:21:37,060
That's a base hit

4720
08:21:39,779 --> 08:21:41,779

Challenge him with his strike zone takes a pitch below the knees ball one muscle

4736
08:25:35,659 --> 08:25:39,740
It's just that you can't play this game on all-star mode and expect to get do anything

4737
08:25:46,740 --> 08:25:49,459
I don't think this is actually possible to win on all-star

4738
08:25:56,490 --> 08:25:57,849

08:27:39,860 --> 08:27:42,099
I thought I could get a fucking pitch

4749
08:27:42,659 --> 08:27:44,659
That tried to challenge

4750
08:27:51,990 --> 08:27:57,990

Humans strike one. Here's the second pitch

4755
08:28:26,630 --> 08:28:34,229
One in one count her ball at the knees for a strike

4756
08:28:34,790 --> 08:28:44,310
With you stepping in for the second time. Yeah

4757
08:28:44,950 --> 08:28:48,549
Matters one for one. It's the outside corner

4758
08:28:49,110 --> 08:29:02,220
Right one. It's that one on a line to the outfield. Yeah, here's a board with a lead-off single

4759
08:29:02,779 --> 08:29:04,779
Bottom of the third nobody out

4760
08:29:09,049 --> 08:29:12,819
Cooled by the breaking ball one

4761
08:29:13,540 --> 08:29:28,520
The bystander he looks like a different person

4762
08:29:37,080 --> 08:29:40,119
What and he gets that call strike two?

4763
08:29:48,090 --> 08:29:59,419
It's five to two

4764
08:30:00,729 --> 08:30:02,729
Hello, who is up there?

4765
08:30:02,889 --> 08:30:05,139
the pitch

4766
08:30:05,139 --> 08:30:19,419
It's there strike two here jammer all locked up for strike three

4767
08:30:20,060 --> 08:30:35,560
Let's hit the second

4768
08:30:35,560 --> 08:30:37,639
It's impossible

4769
08:30:37,639 --> 08:30:40,439
It's fucking an incompletable. It's

4770
08:30:41,139 --> 08:30:42,840
incompletable baseball

4771
08:30:51,060 --> 08:30:53,060
Get back on that fucking field

4772
08:30:53,459 --> 08:30:55,459
If I don't win this add

4773
08:30:55,459 --> 08:30:57,700
10 billion to the debt 10

4774
08:31:23,610 --> 08:31:25,950
If I win everything from tonight is erased

4775
08:32:30,979 --> 08:32:36,979
No

4776
08:32:55,590 --> 08:33:11,909
Hate this game. How do you miss that pitch? I took one fucking perfectly through it. It's impossible to fucking play this

4777
08:33:18,619 --> 08:33:20,619
But waste your meter you fucking idiot

4778
08:33:21,529 --> 08:33:29,590
What a dumb shithead

4779
08:33:29,669 --> 08:33:32,470
Ball hit this motherfucker in the stomach

4780
08:33:33,430 --> 08:33:35,669
And it doesn't bounce off of them it does that to me

4781
08:33:53,700 --> 08:33:59,139
You catch that

4782
08:34:06,279 --> 08:34:08,279
Easy play that's an easy play we're good

4783
08:34:17,830 --> 08:34:28,869
Oh, thank god that was not a home run. Thank god. That was not a home run

4784
08:34:38,119 --> 08:34:40,119
Let's go

4785
08:34:40,119 --> 08:34:44,540
One hit that's right girl

4786
08:34:49,369 --> 08:34:51,369
So hard good wasted

4787
08:34:52,939 --> 08:34:54,939
I don't care waste your fucking meter. I don't care

4788
08:35:08,470 --> 08:35:15,110
Shit I hit it. It was a bomb and I fucking missed it somehow

4789
08:35:24,840 --> 08:35:29,959
How I don't even understand how is that too late? It's just not too late

4790
08:35:30,599 --> 08:35:34,979
It's either way too late. Oh way too early way too late. Oh way too early

4791
08:35:47,080 --> 08:35:48,599
Doodle kramer

4792
08:35:48,599 --> 08:36:05,349
There's no need to get upset put the computer down and let's get shit breaking ball call. That's not a fucking ball

4793
08:36:46,360 --> 08:36:49,689
If I slayer the lobster and shortstop his arm is terrible

4794
08:37:00,759 --> 08:37:16,590
Throw it in this player don't scream at me

4795
08:37:38,869 --> 08:37:43,740
Here's the pitch

4796
08:38:33,560 --> 08:38:45,080
See you next week. Oh my god, I hate everything nickelodeon sucks

4797
08:38:49,369 --> 08:38:54,090
You know when nick jr is better than nickelodeon the network at the it's they've crossed

4798
08:38:54,490 --> 08:38:59,689
Nick jr is way more cool shows like paw patrol and shit. It's so much cooler than what's on nickelodeon now

4799
08:38:59,930 --> 08:39:20,729
This is broken. Did I break this? I thought I was good. I I I did it

4800
08:39:21,720 --> 08:39:24,040
I went back to where we were at the beginning of the stream

4801
08:39:26,169 --> 08:39:28,340
Is the debt over? No

4802
08:39:28,419 --> 08:39:34,150
No, what I did today right there was I said let's go back to like a billion off

4803
08:39:34,709 --> 08:39:42,759
So it would be where we were when I put the fucking disk in that was not quadruple of nothing

4804
08:39:42,759 --> 08:39:44,759
That was just put us back to where we were

4805
08:39:47,380 --> 08:39:56,580
Oh

4806
08:39:56,580 --> 08:39:59,020
That was I hated that

4807
08:39:59,020 --> 08:40:11,110
That was fun though. I was way too animated tonight. I was so animated. I should have been that animated

4808
08:40:15,880 --> 08:40:18,840
Did I say anything I should take back at the end of the stream? Let's see. What did I say?

4809
08:40:19,400 --> 08:40:28,599
Did I say did I say anything that was like absolutely reprehensible? I don't think so

4810
08:40:29,540 --> 08:40:31,540
What I say nickelodeon sucks

4811
08:40:31,540 --> 08:40:37,080
Every show sucks on nickelodeon. There's one show that's worth watching. That's true, though

4812
08:40:45,900 --> 08:40:54,729
I said halo 2 sucks. No, I didn't when did I do that? You said you wanted to strangle gurr

4813
08:40:56,439 --> 08:41:13,240
Well, uh, that was wild. I hope you had fun. I did even though I got a little a little angry apologize to danny

4814
08:41:14,900 --> 08:41:16,979
What did I say to danny? Oh phantom?

4815
08:41:21,459 --> 08:41:28,060
This game this game is pretty fun. Don't let my bullshit fool you

4816
08:41:31,930 --> 08:41:35,689
I loved it. You were so lively. I was too lively. I don't know what's going on with me

4817
08:41:36,250 --> 08:41:39,000
I was like going like

4818
08:41:39,400 --> 08:41:41,959
I was thinking so many more adam sandlin noises than I typically do

4819
08:41:42,759 --> 08:41:48,549

And I know a lot of people were saying like hey chill. You don't want to hurt yourself

4822
08:42:02,869 --> 08:42:07,189
I mean I did when when the motherfucker got tackled. I I I did I did

4823
08:42:08,009 --> 08:42:09,139
but

4824
08:42:09,139 --> 08:42:11,209
I don't know that

4825
08:42:11,209 --> 08:42:14,650
Going back to like six plus seven eight hour streams sometimes now

4826
08:42:15,369 --> 08:42:17,290
But i'm only live once a week

4827
08:42:17,290 --> 08:42:19,290
So i'll be okay

4828
08:42:19,770 --> 08:42:23,610
If I feel like kind of sore tomorrow, whatever i'll be all right with two days. Whatever

4829
08:42:24,580 --> 08:42:26,580
