1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:02,480
I did it. I'm good.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,169
Hey, what would you guys don't know is before every stream,

3
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:11,089
with the mic muted, I sit here and I get ready. It's an old

4
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:14,699
theater technique, where you kind of sit, you hype yourself

5
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:17,379
up and you get yourself ready for the day and for the

6
00:00:17,379 --> 00:00:22,719
performance. Everybody has their own thing that they do. Me, I

7
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:27,140
go like this. This is how we do it. This is how we do it. This

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,420
is how we do it. This is how we do it. And then I press start

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,960
streaming. I do it every single time.

10
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,780
Hi, guys. Welcome. I got we got some stuff to talk about. Do

11
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:04,569
you actually though? What do you think? Yeah, I'm something of

12
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:10,129
an actor myself. Talking stream, not a talking stream, but an

13
00:01:10,129 --> 00:01:18,980
explanation stream. They're out there today. That must be like a

14
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:27,489
fucking rumor convention today. I'll tell you. Twitch has been

15
00:01:27,489 --> 00:01:34,810
acting up today. Well, my thing that I want to talk about has to

16
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:39,530
do with the stream that was planned today. You said Twitch is

17
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,969
acting like a doofus. Well, Jeremy is acting like a doofus

18
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:54,900
too. Because, sorry to say this, scratch tickets are not sold in

19
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,530
Nevada. There is no state run lottery. There is no lottery.

20
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:03,760
There are no scratch tickets in the state of Nevada. It's one of

21
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:12,900
only six states in the country. So I can't buy scratch tickets.

22
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:23,370
There's too much gambling. So there are a few things here to

23
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:30,879
discuss that that was planned. Well, I just did this is coming

24
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,080
from remember, I'm a recent transplant to Las Vegas. I lived

25
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,830
in Massachusetts my whole life. And every gas station, every

26
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,030
convenience store just had scratch tickets, all of them.

27
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,430
Every single one. So I'm just used to seeing scratch tickets.

28
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:52,050
And I just assumed completely that they're just everywhere,

29
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:58,810
every state, every county. And they don't exist in this state

30
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:08,650
at all. So what here's a possible scenario, and I'm going

31
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,610
to tell you a possible scenario. It's not illegal for me to

32
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:18,379
scratch scratch tickets in the state of Nevada. But I cannot

33
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:22,580
buy them here and I can't cash them in here. So what I might

34
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:28,650
have to here's two possible scenarios. Scenario one, we

35
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:34,150
retroactively just say, every death in Sekiro was a dollar to

36
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,909
the Nevada Humane Society. $221 goes right to the Nevada Humane

37
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:46,289
Society. Okay, that's option one. Option two is have

38
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:53,710
somebody buy me $221 worth of tickets in Massachusetts, send

39
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:58,509
them to me. I scratch them here. And then when I go visit

40
00:03:58,509 --> 00:04:03,969
Massachusetts, which I plan on doing in the next like 30 to 45

41
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:07,370
days, I have a plan to go visit my family. I cash them in there.

42
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:14,250
Because it's not illegal for me to actually scratch a ticket

43
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:23,240
here. I just can't I just can't do anything with it here. Go to

44
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,639
the California state line. Yeah, but the California state line

45
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:29,759
is still that that's like a three hour drive. It's like a

46
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,740
two hour. That's a boomer tapped tactic. I don't know. I'm not

47
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,579
sure what we're gonna do. I haven't figured it out yet. I was

48
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:40,300
very defeated this morning when I realized what was gonna happen.

49
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,959
But listen, listen, listen, listen, listen. And somebody

50
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:51,120
says just do it online. I think there's a I don't like gambling

51
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,860
online. I mean, I could do that. But I don't really I don't want

52
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,899
to do like online gambling. I feel like that's another level

53
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:04,019
up versus just kind of scratching scratch tickets for

54
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,470
charity kind of thing. I don't really want to go to like an

55
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:12,709
online slot vendor and just I don't know. I'm not comfortable

56
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:17,120
with it. I have nothing. I have no problem with gambling. I live

57
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,899
in Las Vegas. And I hit up casinos every so often, right. But

58
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:26,310
I don't really want to do it. But on stream. I don't really

59
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,740
want to. It's not necessarily about like promoting gambling,

60
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,660
but like, Oh, big win. I did it, guys. I don't know. It just

61
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:40,180
doesn't sit too completely well with me. So don't have a problem

62
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:47,009
with it. I just don't personally want to do that. But regardless,

63
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:53,449
that's how that stands today. 2020 hindsight should have

64
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:59,939
probably but why but why would I have tried to research that? You

65
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:02,779
know what I mean? Like our scratch tickets legal in Nevada.

66
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,939
It's the state it's a gambling state. This is the state of

67
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:13,910
gambling in the country. I but regardless, I can be dejected

68
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,029
all I want. But doesn't matter. Today was still German slots is

69
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:20,550
still on the table today. We're still gonna play that. If you

70
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:24,110
don't know what that is. Somebody in the community just

71
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:32,129
made an entire video game. And it's been working on it for a

72
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:36,740
long time. They've been given updates in discord. And there's

73
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,899
a lot of interesting things in it. Apparently, I don't I

74
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,300
haven't played it. So we're going to kind of experience it

75
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:46,339
together. And there's a lot of interesting things in it.

76
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,699
Apparently, it seems fun. It's apparently there's like over an

77
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:52,180
hour or two of content. So it's it's like a full on video

78
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:57,180
game. Actual dev and oh, I would assume that the actual dev in

79
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:03,110
the chat is an actual member of the community. So real dev in

80
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,860
chat. So we're not gonna we're doing that later. Because I

81
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,079
figured I'd rather play Mr. Mosquito, which is a game I've

82
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:15,079
been trying to kind of throw in for a while now. So play Mr.

83
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:18,259
Mosquito until we're kind of sick of it. However long that

84
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:21,180
takes, you know, maybe a couple hours, two or three hours, I

85
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,660
don't know, maybe an hour. Who knows? I might play the game

86
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,629
for 10 minutes and go I want to do something else. So

87
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:34,639
Jermisloft will come after Mr. Mosquito. It's not very long.

88
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,439
Yeah, but we'll see. So with that said, hopefully you guys

89
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:46,370
have listened to my whole spiel here. And we're going to start

90
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,069
off with Mr. Mosquito. This is an old game about being

91
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:53,189
mosquito in somebody's house. That's the whole game. There's

92
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:56,790
nothing else in it. You just have to try to drink blood from

93
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:02,100
people in a house. So we might as well just get it started.

94
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,540
Open crates? No, no, no, that's not the same. The whole idea

95
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,480
was I was going to donate the money to charity and if I open

96
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,959
like a hundred TF2 crates, what the hell am I going to do with

97
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:39,429
like 40 McDonald's shotguns? Flip them on the e-market. Yeah,

98
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:44,389
I'll get like 12 cents for each one of those like re-skinned

99
00:08:45,309 --> 00:08:50,549
color. You know what I mean? It's like, that's bad. This is

100
00:08:50,549 --> 00:08:53,830
blinding in here. That's a reference to one of my old

101
00:08:53,830 --> 00:09:03,289
videos. Yeah, you picked up on it. It's from Fresh Games. You

102
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:06,289
wouldn't get two cents. Zoom computer create. What did that

103
00:09:06,289 --> 00:09:10,340
say? This game contains... Okay, for a second, I just got a

104
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:17,860
little nervous because a bunch of people would... Caution! Why

105
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,899
are there so many warnings? When using insecticide, you should

106
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:22,179
not only read the directions, but you should also follow them

107
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:33,019
carefully. That was a couple of scary moments there. All right.

108
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:41,960
Mr. Mosquito, the Yamada's summer. Loud birds. Are you ready?

109
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:54,600
Welcome to the home of the Yamada family. It's summer. Do you

110
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,360
like summer?

111
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,879
That cat is just fighting on the roof.

112
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,600
Summer drives people crazy. And that makes them commit

113
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:03,039
terrible acts.

114
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,000
What?

115
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:09,679
Take the tiny harmless mosquito, for example. It doesn't

116
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:14,519
have enough time to do much during its one precious short

117
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:21,759
life. Yet with one swipe, a human can snatch such a priceless

118
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:24,679
life away without a second's thought.

119
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,279
Is this like mosquito propaganda?

120
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:28,279
I'm sure that you may already realize...

121
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,360
Mosquitoes suck.

122
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,159
...that you are a mosquito. The insect that bites people and

123
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:41,320
makes them feel itchy. The insect that creates a trail of

124
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,919
swollen bites. As a mosquito, there is something that you

125
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:55,509
naturally have to do. You have to suck blood. You must suck and

126
00:10:55,509 --> 00:11:00,950
store away as much human blood as possible in order to survive

127
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:07,750
the winter and see another spring. However, blood sucking is

128
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,750
accompanied with much danger.

129
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:11,029
I'm sure it is.

130
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:15,870
It may come as a surprise to you, but you're not welcome in

131
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,629
the Yamada family home.

132
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:20,110
She's been talking for a full day.

133
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:27,389
Because you make people feel itchy. Bear in mind that they

134
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:31,110
will go to great lengths to protect themselves from you.

135
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:37,110
Nevertheless, please enjoy your summer of blood sucking.

136
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:40,340
Is that a person just yelling or is it a crow at...

137
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,740
What the hell is that?

138
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:44,379
Oh, that's me. It's Mr. Mosquito.

139
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,580
Mosquito spread disease.

140
00:11:52,289 --> 00:11:56,970
Yeah, they just bite, suck blood, reproduce, hurt you, hurt

141
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:00,350
your family. Start stage briefing for the next stage.

142
00:12:00,789 --> 00:12:04,370
Change mosquito color. I want to get a color scheme. You still

143
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:08,009
only have one color. To win battles within the battle time

144
00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:16,500
attack set. This is a mosquito. This looks like a woodpecker.

145
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:21,409
Okay. Stage.

146
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,009
This is Rena's room.

147
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:29,580
Rena is the daughter of the Yamada family. She went on a

148
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,980
school trip today, and she sprayed herself with bug

149
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:37,500
repellent. But that was some time ago. So it's likely to be

150
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,019
wearing off in some places. You should suck from those spots.

151
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:43,860
Good luck in finding them.

152
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:56,269
Okay. So how do I play?

153
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:01,629
You're too close to me. It's so hot today.

154
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:07,139
Am I? Are they looking at me?

155
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:10,059
It's time over here to take a family picture. I've been

156
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:14,580
looking forward to it. How about taking a picture of just

157
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,100
you and dad? I don't want to be in it.

158
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:20,129
What are you talking about? Why not?

159
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:21,490
Oh, they're looking at me.

160
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:23,970
I just want to see why we have to take the same old pictures

161
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,809
year after year. We take a picture every year. That's

162
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:30,570
enough of a reason. Back me up here, Kenichi.

163
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,460
Are they lying down or are they leaning in?

164
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,500
It's such a pain.

165
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:44,509
Let's not do that this year.

166
00:13:44,549 --> 00:13:46,230
Are they lying down in like a triangle?

167
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:47,549
With their heads together?

168
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,509
It's because of me, isn't it?

169
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,029
You don't want to be in the photo with me, do you?

170
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,659
There's the crow.

171
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,120
I want nothing to do with this. I'm going to my room.

172
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:08,919
I'm so confused.

173
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,120
Okay. So they've spread out.

174
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,399
You've ruined another family gathering. Not yet.

175
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:40,669
So this bug spray in parts of the room. So that's me.

176
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:44,649
I'm so tired.

177
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:46,009
I'm huge.

178
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,720
If a mosquito was that big, I'm getting a baseball bat

179
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,039
and I will tear off drywall from my walls to get rid of that thing.

180
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:54,799
This is like a killer bee.

181
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:04,450
Stage one. I need to get two tanks of blood.

182
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:08,200
There is one EX. What?

183
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,279
I don't even know how to fly.

184
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,360
There's no... It didn't teach me anything.

185
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:21,480
L, R1? Okay, R1 is fly.

186
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:25,379
L1 is stop. Read the manual.

187
00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:34,230
God damn it. Getting started.

188
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:39,100
Ouch. Set up your PlayStation 2 controllers.

189
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,360
Okay, ouch.

190
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,519
It's summer, hot and humid.

191
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:44,120
A mosquito is patrolling the Yamada house.

192
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,639
It must suck blood to survive, so it attacks the Yamada at every opportunity.

193
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:49,159
Mr. and Mrs. Yamada and their daughter Rina are sick of itching.

194
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,720
Every member of the family is ready to stand up and swat you to avoid those nasty bites.

195
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,000
This mosquito faces life and death battles on an hourly basis.

196
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,279
Okay. About insecticides.

197
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:03,000
God damn it. I forgot you had to read this shit back.

198
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,919
Seamen again.

199
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:09,929
When using insecticide in real life, be sure to refer to the manufacturer's instructions.

200
00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:11,570
Why are they so concerned about that?

201
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:16,669
Do people just like... Okay, here we go.

202
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:21,049
Rear view. Okay, 180... R2 is 180 degree turn.

203
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:25,370
R1 is accelerate. L1 is decelerate and reverse.

204
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:29,870
Triangle is change camera angle and take off.

205
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,860
I'm just going to have this right here.

206
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,990
Circle is attack and stabilize.

207
00:16:36,669 --> 00:16:38,269
X button is take off.

208
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:40,549
Square is take off.

209
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:47,870
So R1, L1 and then circle.

210
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:50,320
Who fucking cares?

211
00:16:58,539 --> 00:16:59,179
Can you see me?

212
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,259
Did I get crashed into her face?

213
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:21,099
What?

214
00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:24,779
Attack all the points?

215
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:25,299
What?

216
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:27,619
I don't... I can turn the lights off?

217
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,900
I don't understand.

218
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,450
Why does she sound like she weighs 5000 pounds?

219
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,920
Why are we having a battle?

220
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:52,900
How do I attack?

221
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:03,779
Bite!

222
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:05,660
Bite it!

223
00:18:07,779 --> 00:18:09,380
Circle is supposed to be attack.

224
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:18,339
Okay.

225
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,960
Attack and stabilize.

226
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,339
Accelerate. Select is not used.

227
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:34,539
Menu controls. Mosquito... All right, listen.

228
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:39,920
Push the left analog stick to point the view. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

229
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,079
Press R1 to speed up. L1 to slow down.

230
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,960
Press L1 button when stationary to reverse.

231
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:48,299
Move around. Yeah, okay.

232
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:50,980
Press the R2 button to perform 180s.

233
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,970
Lock on. A red frame highlights relax points,

234
00:18:55,609 --> 00:18:58,890
blood sucking points and gimmicks in the room.

235
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:04,250
With the left analog stick, align the green lock on cursor with the red frames to lock on.

236
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:08,089
Press the circle button to attack a locked on target.

237
00:19:08,809 --> 00:19:10,089
So I can't just do it anywhere.

238
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:20,680
Press the circle button to alleviate temporary loss of control when you crash into walls.

239
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,059
Push the right analog stick.

240
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:25,740
R3 button.

241
00:19:26,619 --> 00:19:28,539
Once you land on a blood sucking point,

242
00:19:28,539 --> 00:19:31,180
pierce your host's skin with a needle-like proboscis.

243
00:19:32,299 --> 00:19:35,099
Rotate the right analog stick to suck blood.

244
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:39,480
To suck blood faster, rotate the right analog stick faster.

245
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,960
To suck slower, rotate slower.

246
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,839
Blood sucking causes your host's stress level to increase.

247
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:45,640
Jesus Christ.

248
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:00,700
Just redo it.

249
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,750
I'm not done.

250
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,720
So slowly stealth. I'm gonna turn the lights off.

251
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,140
So I'm gonna kill the lights.

252
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,579
So that you can't see.

253
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:22,339
And then it's R3.

254
00:20:33,829 --> 00:20:34,710
Okay, I'm ready.

255
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:39,500
We're gonna hit the lights.

256
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,869
Suck the light bulb.

257
00:20:48,869 --> 00:20:50,869
No, I'm gonna get like light bulb juice in me.

258
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:57,059
Okay, now that I had to read the instructional manual.

259
00:20:57,059 --> 00:21:01,289
Let's turn the lights off.

260
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:06,599
Okay, here we go.

261
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,680
I'm gonna be careful.

262
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,190
So get the cursor in there. Lock on.

263
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,710
It's locked on. Let's decelerate.

264
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:21,700
I can't see anything though.

265
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,900
This is bad for me.

266
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,079
What did I just run into?

267
00:21:31,849 --> 00:21:33,130
Where is that? I need a lock on point.

268
00:21:35,109 --> 00:21:35,829
Lock on point.

269
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:50,490
What's the point of turning...

270
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,690
Okay, I see it.

271
00:21:59,779 --> 00:22:00,500
Why would you just...

272
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,019
Okay, why would you sleep with the lights on?

273
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:16,200
Keep the ball in the blue.

274
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,000
This is a lot.

275
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,759
Area of the meter you can press.

276
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:31,400
What did that say?

277
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:37,140
How much blood am I gonna take?

278
00:22:43,509 --> 00:22:44,470
Okay, two tanks.

279
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:46,230
Okay, let's go.

280
00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:48,549
How was it the first time?

281
00:22:49,509 --> 00:22:51,990
I hope you enjoyed your first blood suck.

282
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,750
Okay, that's fucking creepy.

283
00:22:55,349 --> 00:22:58,490
Take all of it.

284
00:23:01,859 --> 00:23:14,519
This is not a porn game.

285
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:17,079
Guys, on the back of the box,

286
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:18,039
I'm gonna read this to you.

287
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:18,519
Are you ready?

288
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:22,119
Mr. Mosquito.

289
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,680
Rated T for teen.

290
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,519
Published by Eidos Interactive.

291
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:30,069
Comic mischief, mild violence.

292
00:23:32,539 --> 00:23:45,750
There's somebody in a tub on the back of this though.

293
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,470
Is this comic mischief?

294
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:49,990
I don't have any clothes on.

295
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:50,710
I gotta be careful here.

296
00:23:57,259 --> 00:23:58,220
That's on the back of the box.

297
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:04,730
It's rated T for teen.

298
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:14,140
This is the Yamada's storeroom.

299
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:18,220
Rina's mother Kaneo is looking for their family albums.

300
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:23,160
The storeroom is full of toxic clothing inside.

301
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,200
Try to avoid the toxic air as you fly around.

302
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:28,759
No, you didn't.

303
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,740
No, you did not.

304
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:46,309
Look, how would it reflect off a PlayStation case?

305
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,440
Not possible.

306
00:24:51,619 --> 00:24:53,220
It reflected off itself.

307
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,900
There's no way you guys saw anything.

308
00:24:55,460 --> 00:25:00,579
Nice chest hair.

309
00:25:00,579 --> 00:25:01,940
Let's see, I'm covered in chest hair.

310
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,140
I'm covered in chest hair.

311
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,539
It's on my legs.

312
00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:15,660
I got chest hair on my back.

313
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,980
But if there's a mosquito here, you'll be next.

314
00:25:36,019 --> 00:25:37,220
You must be kidding.

315
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:39,059
Why do all these...

316
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:41,859
I don't understand this whole heads in frame thing.

317
00:25:41,859 --> 00:25:42,339
I'm looking for something.

318
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,079
What are you looking for?

319
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,160
All right, get fucked, Jerma.

320
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,039
You actually got me there.

321
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,480
No, you don't have to lip sync any animations.

322
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:09,960
That's true.

323
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:16,019
All right, you got your T-pose.

324
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,779
Why is this scary?

325
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,319
Stage two, look out for the poison in the air.

326
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:24,519
Suck two tanks of blood.

327
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,779
Well, Jesus.

328
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:31,420
We got first spot.

329
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,220
Ow.

330
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:39,299
Okay, easy.

331
00:26:41,619 --> 00:26:43,779
You don't have any, like, points of interest.

332
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:46,579
Right here?

333
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:49,769
Battle.

334
00:27:03,769 --> 00:27:05,769
What did I just do?

335
00:27:05,769 --> 00:27:06,730
I don't understand.

336
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:09,450
I had to hit you in the stomach?

337
00:27:09,849 --> 00:27:20,150
I got to hit you right in the forehead.

338
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:22,150
All right, I can't go up that high.

339
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:28,539
I have to hit you in a bunch of pressure points.

340
00:27:28,539 --> 00:27:30,539
Oh, this is so dumb.

341
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:36,359
Watch out for the poison.

342
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:42,569
I, it's, I...

343
00:27:48,309 --> 00:27:55,029
Got you, headshot.

344
00:27:55,029 --> 00:28:01,480
Now what?

345
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,849
What the fuck is going on?

346
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:12,940
Where am I supposed to bite?

347
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:17,099
I don't see any marker.

348
00:28:17,099 --> 00:28:19,099
There's no red marker.

349
00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:25,109
Down there, got it.

350
00:28:25,109 --> 00:28:26,230
Fuck that up.

351
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,200
What?

352
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,759
I pressed the button.

353
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:46,440
Where did...

354
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,700
Where did that marker go?

355
00:28:49,700 --> 00:29:02,569
Hello? What?

356
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:04,569
Okay.

357
00:29:04,569 --> 00:29:06,569
Why can I not do this?

358
00:29:06,569 --> 00:29:08,569
Is it on the other leg?

359
00:29:08,569 --> 00:29:10,940
Oh my god.

360
00:29:21,369 --> 00:29:23,369
Why?

361
00:29:23,369 --> 00:29:25,369
Which leg is this?

362
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:27,539
It's not this one.

363
00:29:37,049 --> 00:29:39,049
Okay, I have another opportunity, apparently.

364
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:44,150
No, I don't.

365
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:52,470
Dude, what?

366
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,970
What?

367
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,400
What?

368
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,400
What?

369
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,400
What?

370
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,400
What?

371
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,400
What?

372
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,400
Lady, by the way, I don't think you should be in a closed

373
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,400
off room with a bunch of poison in it.

374
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,400
Get out of here.

375
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,400
You're breathing in all

376
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,400
these fumes.

377
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,480
Oh shit.

378
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,339
This lady is breathing in.

379
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:40,650
Just raid.

380
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:54,200
This is a nice porn game.

381
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,740
It's not a porn game.

382
00:30:58,819 --> 00:31:02,859
Yes, it is.

383
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:04,859
This is not a porn game.

384
00:31:04,859 --> 00:31:06,859
It's not a porn game.

385
00:31:06,859 --> 00:31:08,859
This is not porn.

386
00:31:08,859 --> 00:31:10,859
Stop this.

387
00:31:10,859 --> 00:31:13,859
You're making me self-conscious.

388
00:31:21,859 --> 00:31:23,859
Keep saying porn.

389
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:33,859
Don't worry, though.

390
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:36,170
Based on your actions,

391
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:38,170
you will have plenty of chances

392
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:40,170
to suck his blood.

393
00:31:50,019 --> 00:31:52,019
If we're just gonna play this game,

394
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:54,019
this game was like $75.

395
00:31:54,019 --> 00:31:56,019
Okay?

396
00:31:56,019 --> 00:31:58,019
I've wasted a lot of money on these PlayStation 2

397
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:00,019
porn games, okay?

398
00:32:00,099 --> 00:32:02,099
Get them out again?

399
00:32:02,099 --> 00:32:06,579
You like doing that, don't you?

400
00:32:06,579 --> 00:32:10,859
You've got an insect bite mark. It's swollen.

401
00:32:10,859 --> 00:32:16,549
Oh dear.

402
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:19,430
It wasn't $75. It was like $50.

403
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:21,430
Rub some aloe on it.

404
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:23,430
Hate it.

405
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:25,430
I can't believe that's on there. You have to rub some aloe on it.

406
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,430
Honestly.

407
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:31,980
Is he working out at the gym?

408
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,980
This is a good gym playlist.

409
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,980
Next time you come home late, I won't say a word

410
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,980
about it to your father.

411
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:46,599
Really?

412
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,680
Default cartoon Tom and Jerry sound effects.

413
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:58,170
The horn.

414
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:00,170
I'm gonna lose my mind.

415
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:02,170
I'm gonna lose my mind.

416
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:12,730
I gotta stay focused.

417
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:15,859
What are you watching?

418
00:33:15,859 --> 00:33:19,190
That's what was coming out of the TV.

419
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:22,140
What a wacky weather report.

420
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,140
Be careful of the air current coming from the air conditioner.

421
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,140
Suck three tanks of blood this time.

422
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,140
Right from the top of his head.

423
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:35,539
Let's get in there.

424
00:33:35,619 --> 00:33:39,910
I'm bored.

425
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:44,839
Did he just punch himself in the face?

426
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:51,380
Stay focused.

427
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:55,990
Fuck.

428
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:59,960
Okay. Here it is.

429
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:04,569
Got it.

430
00:34:04,569 --> 00:34:07,190
Three pints of blood.

431
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:10,780
What?

432
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:17,880
He just instantly killed me.

433
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:34,780
Why did I just instantly die?

434
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,780
You didn't do the...

435
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:41,559
You didn't counter it.

436
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:43,559
Wait for him to punch himself in the face.

437
00:34:45,099 --> 00:34:47,099
After he punches himself in the face.

438
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:51,369
This is freaking me out.

439
00:34:51,369 --> 00:34:58,599
I got it.

440
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:00,599
Telephone call.

441
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:05,530
Distraction.

442
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:19,530
He's gonna get up and answer the phone.

443
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:22,579
Put this in there.

444
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:24,820
Come on.

445
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:30,260
Why?

446
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:37,880
Why couldn't I do that?

447
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:42,039
Wait till he punches himself in the face.

448
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:47,219
He punches himself right in the mouth.

449
00:35:47,219 --> 00:35:50,789
What?

450
00:35:50,789 --> 00:35:53,670
Here it comes.

451
00:35:53,750 --> 00:36:00,150
Punch in face.

452
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:07,239
What's wrong with me?

453
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:11,909
What's going on?

454
00:36:11,909 --> 00:36:13,909
What?

455
00:36:13,909 --> 00:36:21,019
Maybe not the head.

456
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:23,019
Maybe it's somewhere else.

457
00:36:23,019 --> 00:36:31,530
My stress levels...

458
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,530
Their stress levels are too high.

459
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:38,579
He can hear you.

460
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:44,789
That's his stress level.

461
00:36:44,789 --> 00:36:55,539
We gotta get in there quick.

462
00:36:55,539 --> 00:36:57,539
He goes, I'm bored.

463
00:36:57,539 --> 00:36:59,539
We gotta get in there.

464
00:36:59,539 --> 00:37:01,539
Air current coming from the air...

465
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:03,929
That doesn't seem like it matters.

466
00:37:03,929 --> 00:37:09,559
Here we go.

467
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:11,559
His stress is fine.

468
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:14,440
Get in there.

469
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,440
He's bored.

470
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,659
Stress is alright.

471
00:37:20,659 --> 00:37:29,289
Easy.

472
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:32,039
Where's that indicator?

473
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:37,480
Oh my fucking god.

474
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:49,639
Is there anywhere else I can bite him?

475
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:52,329
Maybe the head is just not the one to do.

476
00:37:52,329 --> 00:37:54,329
Can I get him in the foot?

477
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:56,329
Or in the ankle or something?

478
00:37:56,329 --> 00:38:06,179
I think I have to distract him.

479
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:13,690
Let me see.

480
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:15,690
Oh, I'm gonna change the channel on him.

481
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:17,690
He's gonna get really mad about this.

482
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:23,699
Turn.

483
00:38:23,699 --> 00:38:30,489
Okay, I'm high enough where I should be able to get an indicator here.

484
00:38:30,489 --> 00:38:32,489
There it is.

485
00:38:32,489 --> 00:38:38,300
God damn it.

486
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:44,440
Stress is fine.

487
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,920
Come on, give me the indicator.

488
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:55,429
Give it to me!

489
00:38:55,429 --> 00:38:59,079
What are you doing?

490
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:01,579
There it is.

491
00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:11,349
Okay, hold on.

492
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,349
He's stressed.

493
00:39:13,429 --> 00:39:20,840
Got it.

494
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,840
Watch that stress level.

495
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:30,380
How many are there?

496
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,380
Three?

497
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,380
I'm not gonna get all three right now.

498
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,380
Don't do it.

499
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,380
What's his level like?

500
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,380
He's getting a little stressed.

501
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,380
I'm gonna back off.

502
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,380
Yeah, I'm backing off.

503
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:59,539
Oh!

504
00:39:59,539 --> 00:40:01,539
I'm gonna turn the phone on.

505
00:40:01,539 --> 00:40:04,420
Oh shit, he just turned on the AC.

506
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:08,969
He turned on the air conditioner somehow.

507
00:40:08,969 --> 00:40:10,969
Where's the AC come from?

508
00:40:10,969 --> 00:40:16,539
He's not gonna see me, right?

509
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:22,809
I can't get it from here.

510
00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:27,030
The AC's off.

511
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:29,530
Let's get it.

512
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,530
What?

513
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:40,360
How?

514
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,429
Same deal. Far away.

515
00:40:43,429 --> 00:40:45,429
The stress level should be good and manageable.

516
00:40:45,429 --> 00:40:47,860
And three, two, one.

517
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,940
Last off.

518
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,570
He's good?

519
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:54,739
Give me one more.

520
00:40:54,739 --> 00:40:56,739
And then tutorial dad is done.

521
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,880
They get more stressed if you don't keep it in the blue.

522
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,880
Don't swap me, please.

523
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,880
Thank god.

524
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,880
Alright, get up.

525
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:29,340
That was loud.

526
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:50,380
I did it.

527
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,380
Can I change my...

528
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,380
No, I only have one color.

529
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:27,130
Okay.

530
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:47,800
Just trying to get something ready here.

531
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,800
Just in case I need it.

532
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:14,139
I don't think I can...

533
00:43:14,139 --> 00:43:24,179
Those have to see.

534
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:37,110
It's alright.

535
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:54,840
Let's make this quick.

536
00:43:54,840 --> 00:44:24,389
Get out! Out! Out!

537
00:44:24,389 --> 00:44:28,550
Alright, we're fine.

538
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:43,210
It's all, like, blurred out.

539
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:59,980
Don't look over here.

540
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:18,659
I keep hitting the bubbles, don't make those noises.

541
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,030
Just let me get all three.

542
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:39,030
I gotta get out.

543
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:41,030
Why is everybody so bored?

544
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,030
Give me this last one, then get out.

545
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:45,030
Out, out, get out, get out now.

546
00:45:45,030 --> 00:46:11,380
Nope!

547
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,380
And when you pop a bubble, guys, it goes...

548
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:17,099
SHIT!

549
00:46:26,789 --> 00:46:28,789
Get out.

550
00:46:28,789 --> 00:47:25,530
Where is she?

551
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:31,289
Fuck you!

552
00:47:31,369 --> 00:47:35,849
I only have a minute left?

553
00:47:35,849 --> 00:47:40,710
Alright, no more jokes.

554
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:42,710
You can't even see anything anyways, who cares?

555
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:53,400
I can't see anything at all.

556
00:47:53,400 --> 00:48:03,179
Right here, come on.

557
00:48:03,179 --> 00:48:05,800
29 seconds.

558
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,099
Give me the indicator.

559
00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:28,059
It's just a floating hair.

560
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:52,949
It looks so much worse.

561
00:48:53,030 --> 00:49:06,340
Drink the bath water?

562
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:12,340
Like, as the mosquito, that would...

563
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:14,340
Mosquitoes don't need that.

564
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:16,340
Mosquitoes don't drink water.

565
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:37,190
Mosquitoes don't drink water?

566
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:39,269
Mosquitoes don't drink water, they drink blood.

567
00:49:39,269 --> 00:49:41,269
There's water in blood.

568
00:49:45,269 --> 00:49:47,269
Don't read chat right now.

569
00:49:47,269 --> 00:49:49,269
Yeah!

570
00:49:49,269 --> 00:49:51,269
I know!

571
00:49:53,269 --> 00:49:55,269
This is how I feel, yeah, I'm here too.

572
00:49:55,269 --> 00:49:57,269
This is how I feel reading chat right now.

573
00:50:13,369 --> 00:50:18,250
I think that there is a mosquito in the house.

574
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:20,550
You think?

575
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,550
Go and buy some insecticide, Kanaeo.

576
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:24,550
And make sure it works.

577
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:28,550
No way that you could go and buy some yourself?

578
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:35,989
Mom, weren't you going to cook dinner now?

579
00:50:35,989 --> 00:50:40,300
I'd like to eat potato cakes tonight.

580
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:43,880
Really?

581
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,880
Let's have potato cakes for dinner then.

582
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,880
That's great!

583
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,960
But mom, I'm not sure about the way you make them.

584
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:55,159
What are you saying?

585
00:50:55,159 --> 00:50:57,159
There's nothing wrong with the way that I make them.

586
00:50:57,159 --> 00:50:59,159
Well, okay.

587
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:01,159
I'm going to light a mosquito coil in the kitchen.

588
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:03,159
What?

589
00:51:03,159 --> 00:51:05,400
Typical.

590
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:12,500
Ugh.

591
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:25,750
Nobody knew what they were saying.

592
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,750
That's weird.

593
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:35,750
What happened to my stream labs?

594
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:38,119
Dashboard!

595
00:51:38,119 --> 00:51:43,559
There it is, okay.

596
00:51:43,639 --> 00:51:46,329
Cooking.

597
00:51:46,329 --> 00:51:50,340
Wow.

598
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:58,280
This mother is insane.

599
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,840
That was four or five front flips.

600
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,840
Without touching any of the shit.

601
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,079
Stay away from the mosquito coil fumes.

602
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:07,079
There are two blo-

603
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:09,260
Okay.

604
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:14,949
What did that even say?

605
00:52:14,949 --> 00:52:16,949
The mom is a god gamer.

606
00:52:16,949 --> 00:52:18,949
Is that a god gamer?

607
00:52:18,949 --> 00:52:21,190
Or is-

608
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:23,190
What do you mean, god gamer?

609
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:26,840
Okay, I gotta get both knees.

610
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,989
She did a front flip.

611
00:52:29,989 --> 00:52:38,820
What does that have to do with gaming?

612
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:41,900
Come on, let's see it.

613
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:46,179
It's right when she goes to the front of the sink.

614
00:52:46,179 --> 00:52:48,179
Hold on, can I distract her with something?

615
00:52:48,179 --> 00:52:50,179
Can I fuck with the hot dogs?

616
00:52:52,809 --> 00:52:54,809
Only a god gamer could-

617
00:52:54,809 --> 00:52:56,980
Alright, I have to get the feet.

618
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:59,159
So it's both feet.

619
00:52:59,159 --> 00:53:01,719
How-

620
00:53:01,719 --> 00:53:07,460
I'm gonna get killed here.

621
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:15,269
Alright, here we go.

622
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,960
How long does she do this for?

623
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:32,119
She's eventually gonna stop doing this pose.

624
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:36,119
Why would you do this pose for this long?

625
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:44,119
There's no way.

626
00:53:44,119 --> 00:53:51,349
You still going?

627
00:53:51,349 --> 00:53:56,219
Alright, there we go.

628
00:53:56,300 --> 00:54:01,219
Okay, that's right.

629
00:54:01,219 --> 00:54:10,889
Here we go.

630
00:54:10,889 --> 00:54:12,889
Let's do the other one this time.

631
00:54:12,889 --> 00:54:14,889
Actually, no, we're just gonna do it together.

632
00:54:16,889 --> 00:54:19,059
They even feel it.

633
00:54:19,059 --> 00:54:21,059
They go, ow.

634
00:54:33,059 --> 00:54:35,059
That's it?

635
00:54:35,139 --> 00:54:39,159
Now what?

636
00:54:39,159 --> 00:54:41,159
What was the briefing? How many do I need?

637
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:44,619
Oh shit, careful.

638
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:57,420
The other one, okay.

639
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:02,409
Shouldn't be too hard.

640
00:55:02,409 --> 00:55:04,409
Right there.

641
00:55:04,409 --> 00:55:06,409
Really?

642
00:55:06,409 --> 00:55:08,409
God damn it. Alright, it's-

643
00:55:08,409 --> 00:55:11,269
I can get it.

644
00:55:11,269 --> 00:55:14,789
What? I gotta go from the top.

645
00:55:14,789 --> 00:55:16,789
Uh oh, bad news.

646
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:29,460
So I gotta go right in front.

647
00:55:29,539 --> 00:55:34,150
What?

648
00:55:41,059 --> 00:55:47,699
Why?

649
00:55:52,119 --> 00:56:01,719
How did I fail that?

650
00:56:01,719 --> 00:56:03,719
This is not a porn game!

651
00:56:03,719 --> 00:56:15,750
Do I get an indicator of when she's gonna move?

652
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:31,750
One more.

653
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:43,750
Got it.

654
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:45,750
You're a degenerate.

655
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:55,510
Why is she doing this twice?

656
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:58,519
Did she get hurt? Did she fall down?

657
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:13,190
What are we implying here?

658
00:57:13,269 --> 00:57:15,699
What are we implying here?

659
00:57:15,699 --> 00:57:17,699
That she did a couple backflips or frontflips and landed her head?

660
00:57:17,699 --> 00:57:22,500
Now I feel guilty?

661
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,500
Is that what that was?

662
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:28,599
Alright.

663
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:39,900
She's armed with an insecticide.

664
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:43,900
Oh great.

665
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:48,869
So now they have weapons.

666
00:57:53,179 --> 00:57:55,179
The potato cakes are ruined.

667
00:57:55,179 --> 00:57:57,420
I'm sorry, degenerates.

668
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:01,980
I don't mind.

669
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:03,980
Just as long as you are safe.

670
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:12,300
Kenichi.

671
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:14,300
You're bothering the neighbors. Keep it down.

672
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:18,650
Did she just say that?

673
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:23,260
Don't break that bag, Zappa.

674
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:25,260
It's new, you know?

675
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:29,159
Really?

676
00:58:29,159 --> 00:58:31,159
A wolf?

677
00:58:31,159 --> 00:58:34,039
She's just like her mother.

678
00:58:34,039 --> 00:58:36,469
In fact, wolves just walk by the house.

679
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:38,550
Alright.

680
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:49,739
So we're in her room.

681
00:58:49,739 --> 00:58:59,909
She has bug spray and a zapper.

682
00:58:59,909 --> 00:59:02,280
Is she screaming that?

683
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,280
The cuckoo clock?

684
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:19,380
Okay, that's VR game level of involvement there.

685
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:38,489
What's with this posture?

686
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:43,480
What?

687
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,480
Alright, we're easy.

688
00:59:45,559 --> 00:59:48,309
What?

689
00:59:48,309 --> 00:59:50,309
Alright, we're easy.

690
00:59:50,309 --> 00:59:52,309
You just turned this into a lot more difficult for me.

691
00:59:54,309 --> 00:59:57,880
I made a lot.

692
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,880
Let me get the bug zapper.

693
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,880
And then, where am I supposed to bite?

694
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:08,900
Do you see it?

695
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:10,900
The neck maybe?

696
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:13,579
Bone?

697
01:00:13,579 --> 01:00:15,579
Turn it off?

698
01:00:15,579 --> 01:00:25,369
Let me turn it off.

699
01:00:25,369 --> 01:00:28,440
What do we got? What am I supposed to get?

700
01:00:32,789 --> 01:00:34,789
Oh, it's that.

701
01:00:34,789 --> 01:00:36,789
I thought that was a toaster.

702
01:00:36,789 --> 01:00:39,289
Let's see what we can do here.

703
01:00:39,289 --> 01:00:41,530
The leg?

704
01:00:41,530 --> 01:00:43,530
I don't see anything.

705
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:45,530
It's probably arm, neck?

706
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:47,530
Face?

707
01:00:47,530 --> 01:00:52,010
Watch out.

708
01:00:55,449 --> 01:00:58,199
Shoulder?

709
01:01:02,199 --> 01:01:06,619
Oh, she hit me.

710
01:01:06,699 --> 01:01:10,070
I don't have any idea.

711
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:14,489
Answer the phone?

712
01:01:14,489 --> 01:01:16,489
Got it.

713
01:01:16,489 --> 01:01:25,059
Wait, who called her?

714
01:01:25,059 --> 01:01:30,230
She's pretending to answer the phone.

715
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:32,230
I just hit the button.

716
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:37,670
There's nobody on that phone.

717
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:43,239
Okay, so I called somebody else and then she's acting.

718
01:01:43,239 --> 01:01:47,210
I don't understand that.

719
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:49,210
Got it.

720
01:01:49,210 --> 01:02:07,239
I'm going to still be in here, right?

721
01:02:07,239 --> 01:02:09,239
Even when she hangs the phone up?

722
01:02:09,239 --> 01:02:11,239
Out.

723
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:16,250
Out.

724
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:23,400
Yeah, what kind of conversation was that?

725
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,400
Was she taking a delivery order?

726
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:28,469
I'll take a sausage and onion.

727
01:02:28,469 --> 01:02:30,469
Yes, okay.

728
01:02:30,469 --> 01:02:32,469
And I'll also take a side of french fries, too.

729
01:02:32,469 --> 01:02:34,469
Oh, yes, okay.

730
01:02:34,469 --> 01:02:36,969
And I also want an Italian sub.

731
01:02:36,969 --> 01:02:38,969
Yes, okay.

732
01:02:38,969 --> 01:02:53,449
Can you mash up a mosquito and grind it up and put it in the fucking smoothie for me?

733
01:02:53,449 --> 01:02:55,449
I gotta get out.

734
01:02:55,449 --> 01:03:12,469
There we go.

735
01:03:12,469 --> 01:03:18,300
I just have to keep doing this.

736
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:22,469
Yeah, this is rockin' music.

737
01:03:22,469 --> 01:03:38,599
Fuck.

738
01:03:38,599 --> 01:03:40,599
I gotta go back further.

739
01:03:42,599 --> 01:03:44,599
Risky. Too risky. Too risky out.

740
01:03:46,599 --> 01:03:51,780
I gotta try to put it on the spot.

741
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:56,329
She keeps answering the phone.

742
01:03:56,329 --> 01:03:58,329
Maybe I can just get it without...

743
01:03:58,329 --> 01:04:00,329
Nah, I definitely have to do. Anything else in the room I can do?

744
01:04:00,329 --> 01:04:02,329
I can turn the lights off, but that sucks.

745
01:04:02,329 --> 01:04:04,500
I'll try it.

746
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:09,820
She's just entertaining herself.

747
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:12,889
You already got over here?

748
01:04:12,969 --> 01:04:24,659
Oh, no.

749
01:04:24,659 --> 01:04:26,659
Nah, phone is definitely the best tactic.

750
01:04:26,659 --> 01:04:33,369
I just gotta go further up.

751
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:39,590
Turn it on.

752
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:42,539
No!

753
01:04:42,539 --> 01:04:49,059
Just keep calling her.

754
01:04:49,059 --> 01:04:57,769
At what point would you really...

755
01:04:57,769 --> 01:05:00,199
What about...

756
01:05:00,199 --> 01:05:03,590
Can I do something on the other side?

757
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:05,590
Right here on the shoulder.

758
01:05:05,590 --> 01:05:07,590
Come on.

759
01:05:07,590 --> 01:05:18,539
That wasn't the shoulder.

760
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:22,119
Goddammit.

761
01:05:24,119 --> 01:05:26,119
Fuck.

762
01:05:26,119 --> 01:05:30,090
This one's hard.

763
01:05:30,090 --> 01:05:34,699
She's stressed, but I gotta do it.

764
01:05:34,699 --> 01:05:37,130
Ow.

765
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:43,510
Alright, we're fine.

766
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:54,579
I wonder if this will work better, too.

767
01:05:54,579 --> 01:06:00,969
Let me try this.

768
01:06:00,969 --> 01:06:05,579
Can I do it from here, too?

769
01:06:05,579 --> 01:06:08,579
Let me see.

770
01:06:08,579 --> 01:06:11,210
On the shoulder?

771
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:15,110
What? No.

772
01:06:15,110 --> 01:06:17,110
It's only phone?

773
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:20,440
How is phone the only thing...

774
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:23,000
It has to be the phone.

775
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:28,889
Turn off the TV?

776
01:06:28,889 --> 01:06:32,789
I don't think I can.

777
01:06:32,789 --> 01:06:35,539
This is the only way this is gonna work.

778
01:06:35,539 --> 01:06:41,050
It's risky, but I gotta do it.

779
01:06:41,050 --> 01:06:43,050
Give me one, give me one, give me one, give me one.

780
01:06:43,050 --> 01:06:48,619
Out.

781
01:06:48,619 --> 01:06:50,619
Whoa! I just barely missed it.

782
01:06:50,619 --> 01:06:52,619
No, I'm... Oh, no.

783
01:06:52,619 --> 01:06:54,619
Get out.

784
01:06:54,619 --> 01:06:57,429
Quick, turn off the lights.

785
01:06:57,429 --> 01:07:04,539
Okay, she can't reach this high.

786
01:07:04,539 --> 01:07:09,079
Holy shit, she has the spray.

787
01:07:09,079 --> 01:07:14,010
What did I just do?

788
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:27,960
Right in the chest.

789
01:07:28,039 --> 01:07:32,070
Like, right in the heart.

790
01:07:32,070 --> 01:07:34,070
She just counter-punched me.

791
01:07:34,070 --> 01:07:36,070
Holy shit. You gotta be kidding me.

792
01:07:36,070 --> 01:07:40,300
She's gonna spray me!

793
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:42,860
Did it work?

794
01:07:42,860 --> 01:07:50,789
I gotta get her in the knee, I think.

795
01:07:50,789 --> 01:07:53,989
One more spot, right? I think right in the knee.

796
01:07:53,989 --> 01:07:59,610
Where is it? Where is it?

797
01:07:59,610 --> 01:08:06,070
Where's this last spot?

798
01:08:06,070 --> 01:08:14,380
Okay, behind her.

799
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:20,140
Damn it!

800
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:24,729
I got it.

801
01:08:24,729 --> 01:08:26,729
Wait.

802
01:08:26,729 --> 01:08:28,729
Oh, that's the phone.

803
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:30,810
Alright, saved it.

804
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:42,430
I can't do it anymore, I gotta do the shoulder.

805
01:08:43,430 --> 01:08:45,430
Oh my god, no way.

806
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:47,430
I can't do the neck anymore.

807
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:51,909
I gotta do the shoulder.

808
01:08:51,909 --> 01:08:57,859
But how am I gonna...

809
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:21,109
Ooh!

810
01:09:21,109 --> 01:09:24,630
Whoosh!

811
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:27,189
Oh, come on! Holy shit!

812
01:09:27,189 --> 01:09:29,189
Why? Jesus!

813
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:33,819
That went quick!

814
01:09:33,819 --> 01:09:36,890
Oh my god.

815
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:39,579
I'm gonna die.

816
01:09:39,579 --> 01:09:45,270
No, I still have hearts.

817
01:09:45,270 --> 01:09:48,659
I didn't get it.

818
01:09:48,659 --> 01:09:50,659
Oh no, this is bad.

819
01:09:50,659 --> 01:09:54,630
Why can't I turn her on? Turn her on!

820
01:09:54,630 --> 01:10:01,159
This is one.

821
01:10:03,159 --> 01:10:06,100
One behind, two.

822
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:12,119
I gotta do the star fox turn around and go right.

823
01:10:14,119 --> 01:10:18,090
Like this.

824
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:28,500
This is so hard.

825
01:10:28,579 --> 01:10:30,579
Damn it!

826
01:10:30,579 --> 01:10:32,579
No!

827
01:10:32,579 --> 01:10:36,939
Snake, there are only 20 seconds left.

828
01:10:41,539 --> 01:10:48,329
Come on!

829
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:53,399
I gotta wait till she takes the can out.

830
01:10:53,399 --> 01:10:57,819
Okay, can's out. Now I can get the arm.

831
01:10:57,819 --> 01:11:02,300
Holy shit.

832
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:07,779
Get it!

833
01:11:07,779 --> 01:11:11,239
Alright, there's one more down here.

834
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:24,149
No, I didn't get that!

835
01:11:24,229 --> 01:11:32,869
I'm right here!

836
01:11:32,869 --> 01:11:36,869
So I can only do the top of the finger for three or four seconds.

837
01:11:53,050 --> 01:11:56,310
Game. What the hell? Why?

838
01:11:56,310 --> 01:12:03,210
Okay, almost.

839
01:12:08,279 --> 01:12:10,279
That's it.

840
01:12:10,279 --> 01:12:19,500
There's the hang up. Got it.

841
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:28,840
Do it. Hit the phone.

842
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:33,640
You should do it.

843
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:43,420
I gotta do another one?

844
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:45,420
What's the other one?

845
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:09,659
Where is it?

846
01:13:09,659 --> 01:13:11,659
Is it the hand again? No, it's the hand again.

847
01:13:11,659 --> 01:13:21,449
Try something besides phone.

848
01:13:21,449 --> 01:13:23,449
I did the stereo.

849
01:13:23,449 --> 01:13:25,819
It didn't do anything.

850
01:13:25,819 --> 01:13:27,819
I couldn't bite her anywhere.

851
01:13:27,819 --> 01:13:33,819
It's the hand again.

852
01:13:37,699 --> 01:13:39,699
Okay, talk to you soon.

853
01:13:43,699 --> 01:13:45,699
Here it comes.

854
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:00,680
Check on the pillow?

855
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:04,779
I don't see an indicator.

856
01:14:04,779 --> 01:14:06,779
I'm just gonna do this.

857
01:14:06,779 --> 01:14:11,770
The only indicator is the phone and the stereo.

858
01:14:16,890 --> 01:14:18,890
Shit. Not good.

859
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:22,890
Yeah.

860
01:14:24,890 --> 01:14:26,890
Don't risk it.

861
01:14:26,890 --> 01:14:30,020
Don't risk it.

862
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:35,529
Yeah, there's nothing else in here.

863
01:14:35,529 --> 01:14:37,529
I can't mess around with something on the table.

864
01:14:37,529 --> 01:14:41,619
Nothing in the trash.

865
01:14:41,619 --> 01:14:43,619
Stereo is the only one. I can't even press the stereo.

866
01:14:43,619 --> 01:14:45,619
But she kind of kneels down for a second.

867
01:14:45,619 --> 01:14:47,619
This tactic is working.

868
01:14:47,619 --> 01:14:52,939
This will be it.

869
01:14:52,939 --> 01:14:57,670
That's it. Close it up.

870
01:14:57,750 --> 01:15:00,890
Got it.

871
01:15:00,890 --> 01:15:02,890
That was 15 minutes?

872
01:15:02,890 --> 01:15:05,189
Holy shit.

873
01:15:05,189 --> 01:15:10,890
Yeah, but I'm dumb and blame games.

874
01:15:10,890 --> 01:15:12,890
What are you talking about?

875
01:15:12,890 --> 01:15:15,640
There were only two things to activate in the room.

876
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:32,279
What else could I have done besides the phone and the stereo?

877
01:15:32,279 --> 01:15:34,279
The TV didn't have an indicator on it.

878
01:15:49,779 --> 01:15:51,779
Don't touch anything.

879
01:16:05,779 --> 01:16:07,779
Avoid everything.

880
01:16:07,779 --> 01:16:13,420
Yeah, no feet.

881
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:17,000
Not this time.

882
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Stop all hobbies that cause injuries.

883
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Flower arranging is the spirit of Japan.

884
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
What do you think, Rena?

885
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Would you like to try it?

886
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,689
No way.

887
01:16:37,689 --> 01:16:41,689
Genichi, I covered the tummy mats in the Japanese room with tick insecticide.

888
01:16:43,689 --> 01:16:45,689
There's no way that I'm going to be beaten.

889
01:16:45,689 --> 01:16:47,689
That makes me feel a lot better.

890
01:16:51,689 --> 01:16:53,689
I wonder if it's a tick though.

891
01:16:58,359 --> 01:17:00,359
Why is this guy wearing glasses with no lenses?

892
01:17:02,359 --> 01:17:12,840
I don't know. That's a good question.

893
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:14,840
Who names their room the Japanese room?

894
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:23,800
All right. Don't touch anything.

895
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:32,760
This is going to be difficult. How am I going to get in here?

896
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:37,180
Why is he just staring at this?

897
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:40,310
What's going on?

898
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:47,529
Is this like meditation or something?

899
01:17:47,529 --> 01:17:49,529
Stay away from the floor mats and mosquito coil fumes.

900
01:17:51,529 --> 01:17:57,159
Okay. So we can't do that.

901
01:17:57,159 --> 01:17:59,979
So we have to stay away from the fumes.

902
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:02,060
Let's see. I can't do anything there.

903
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:06,939
He's breathing in the fumes?

904
01:18:06,939 --> 01:18:08,939
Oh, shit. Okay.

905
01:18:08,939 --> 01:18:10,939
I'm like trapped in here.

906
01:18:10,939 --> 01:18:13,109
It's hot.

907
01:18:13,109 --> 01:18:15,109
What points of interest?

908
01:18:15,109 --> 01:18:19,140
On his back?

909
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:21,140
That might be his chest.

910
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:26,460
Maybe this way.

911
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:34,010
I think it might be his chest.

912
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:40,539
Then over there.

913
01:18:40,539 --> 01:18:43,100
I can't touch anything there.

914
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:45,100
Maybe this way.

915
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:51,260
Does he hurt thorns?

916
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:54,140
I have to bite him in the eye?

917
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:56,140
No. What about over here?

918
01:18:56,140 --> 01:19:01,000
Can I activate this?

919
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:08,420
Nothing I can activate.

920
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:12,010
There's no button to press.

921
01:19:12,010 --> 01:19:15,020
What about behind me? Can I turn the light off?

922
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:18,279
I have no idea what this guy is doing.

923
01:19:18,279 --> 01:19:20,279
I have to bite him in the mouth.

924
01:19:20,279 --> 01:19:25,779
Do I have to bite him in the lips?

925
01:19:34,810 --> 01:19:38,329
I don't understand.

926
01:19:38,329 --> 01:19:53,619
There were no points to attack him.

927
01:19:53,699 --> 01:19:59,699
I don't think I might have to sneak around when he's trying to put the flower in.

928
01:19:59,699 --> 01:20:01,699
I'm almost dead.

929
01:20:01,699 --> 01:20:04,970
I exploded.

930
01:20:04,970 --> 01:20:10,149
Okay.

931
01:20:10,149 --> 01:20:12,460
What happened at the end there?

932
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:17,579
I just got aquatined.

933
01:20:17,579 --> 01:20:20,460
Doesn't Master Shake do that to everybody?

934
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:22,460
After Season 3?

935
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:49,779
It was his chest.

936
01:20:49,779 --> 01:21:01,239
It was somewhere in his stomach.

937
01:21:01,239 --> 01:21:05,079
It was either his stomach or his back.

938
01:21:05,159 --> 01:21:07,159
Don't touch the floor, don't touch the fumes.

939
01:21:07,159 --> 01:21:09,159
There are two points.

940
01:21:09,159 --> 01:21:13,189
Maybe can I go through?

941
01:21:13,189 --> 01:21:15,939
Alright.

942
01:21:15,939 --> 01:21:17,939
I don't even know where the game is.

943
01:21:17,939 --> 01:21:19,939
Maybe this way.

944
01:21:19,939 --> 01:21:23,529
Maybe I can fly through his legs.

945
01:21:23,529 --> 01:21:26,090
This might be Finesse.

946
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:29,159
He's so stressed out.

947
01:21:29,159 --> 01:21:32,939
It's hot.

948
01:21:32,939 --> 01:21:34,939
You again!

949
01:21:42,170 --> 01:21:44,170
I thought maybe I could go through his legs.

950
01:21:44,170 --> 01:21:55,220
This? What are you doing?

951
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:57,300
I was just practicing.

952
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:59,300
Rage Quit?

953
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:01,300
It's faster for me to reload.

954
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:08,279
Next game?

955
01:22:08,279 --> 01:22:11,350
No.

956
01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:18,010
The next game is Germa Slots.

957
01:22:18,010 --> 01:22:21,020
I want to play this for a little longer.

958
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:23,020
That's what's going to happen.

959
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:41,699
I need to beat these people.

960
01:22:41,699 --> 01:22:45,699
I need to at least get to a point where I'm satisfied sucking all their blood.

961
01:22:45,699 --> 01:22:48,010
This game is a 15 hour game.

962
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:50,010
I'm not going to play this game for 15 hours.

963
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:52,090
It's been like an hour and 15 minutes.

964
01:22:52,090 --> 01:22:55,739
Alright.

965
01:22:55,739 --> 01:23:02,899
Maybe this way.

966
01:23:02,899 --> 01:23:06,810
Give me an indicator.

967
01:23:06,810 --> 01:23:09,880
How am I supposed to...

968
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:14,229
It feels like you can't avoid any of that stuff.

969
01:23:14,229 --> 01:23:17,560
It's hot.

970
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:24,020
What is that?

971
01:23:24,020 --> 01:23:26,260
When he says it's hot.

972
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:28,260
He goes it's hot.

973
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:31,399
Maybe this way.

974
01:23:31,399 --> 01:23:34,600
This game is only like 3 hours.

975
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:36,600
It's not like 15 hours.

976
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:38,600
Where are you getting the 15 hours from?

977
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,680
There's 12 stages.

978
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:42,680
Why are people saying this is like a 10 hour game?

979
01:23:48,180 --> 01:23:51,579
I'm waiting for an indicator.

980
01:23:51,579 --> 01:24:00,840
Nothing?

981
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:06,279
Right in the hand.

982
01:24:06,279 --> 01:24:09,350
How long does that last for though?

983
01:24:09,350 --> 01:24:14,260
Maybe this way.

984
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:16,260
How much time do I have?

985
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:18,260
That's like 3 or 4 seconds.

986
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:27,140
Indicator's gone in his hand now.

987
01:24:27,140 --> 01:24:31,180
Maybe this way.

988
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:33,609
He's starting to see me.

989
01:24:33,609 --> 01:24:38,659
He pricks his finger on the rose but how come I didn't see it last time?

990
01:24:38,739 --> 01:24:40,739
I'm just sitting there waiting for it.

991
01:24:40,739 --> 01:24:43,050
It's hot.

992
01:24:43,050 --> 01:24:46,250
I can do his face too.

993
01:24:46,250 --> 01:24:54,439
Maybe this way.

994
01:24:54,439 --> 01:25:01,930
Alright, here it is.

995
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:03,930
My finger.

996
01:25:03,930 --> 01:25:05,930
And no indicator.

997
01:25:05,930 --> 01:25:08,939
That's only on for 2 seconds.

998
01:25:08,939 --> 01:25:12,779
Maybe this way.

999
01:25:12,779 --> 01:25:25,579
It's hot.

1000
01:25:25,579 --> 01:25:29,220
I'm frightened of his lips.

1001
01:25:31,220 --> 01:25:33,220
I should not be able to do it like this.

1002
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:35,300
That's happened to me before though.

1003
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:39,880
How often is a mosquito flown into your mouth?

1004
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:42,250
Then you go like

1005
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:44,250
It happens at least once or twice.

1006
01:25:44,250 --> 01:25:46,250
A season.

1007
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:48,250
It does.

1008
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:50,250
Let me get it all in one go.

1009
01:25:50,329 --> 01:25:52,329
Let's see if we can do it.

1010
01:25:52,329 --> 01:25:54,329
There goes another one.

1011
01:25:54,329 --> 01:25:56,329
I don't know why it's gone.

1012
01:25:56,329 --> 01:25:58,329
It's very hot.

1013
01:25:58,329 --> 01:26:00,329
Here it is.

1014
01:26:00,329 --> 01:26:02,329
I'm going to turn on the indicator.

1015
01:26:02,329 --> 01:26:04,329
If I can actually do this.

1016
01:26:04,329 --> 01:26:06,329
I'm going to do an indicator.

1017
01:26:06,329 --> 01:26:08,329
If I can actually do this.

1018
01:26:08,329 --> 01:26:10,329
See that?

1019
01:26:10,329 --> 01:26:12,329
What aE HP.

1020
01:26:12,329 --> 01:26:14,329
Come on!

1021
01:26:14,329 --> 01:26:16,329
Wait.

1022
01:26:16,329 --> 01:26:18,329
Oh no, I'm going to do the indicator.

1023
01:26:18,329 --> 01:26:44,319
Come on, right in his... right there, right there.

1024
01:26:44,319 --> 01:26:45,319
I didn't hit that.

1025
01:26:45,319 --> 01:26:49,310
What is going on with this camera?

1026
01:26:49,310 --> 01:26:50,310
One more.

1027
01:26:50,310 --> 01:26:53,409
Was it on his back?

1028
01:26:53,409 --> 01:26:54,409
Probably.

1029
01:26:54,409 --> 01:26:57,180
It's probably like on his ass or something.

1030
01:26:57,180 --> 01:26:58,180
Alright, I gotta be careful.

1031
01:26:58,180 --> 01:27:13,569
I just need to do this like one more time.

1032
01:27:13,569 --> 01:27:21,670
Right in his mouth.

1033
01:27:21,670 --> 01:27:22,670
Right in his mouth, same deal.

1034
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:24,170
Right in his lip.

1035
01:27:24,170 --> 01:27:49,130
And we need one more.

1036
01:27:49,130 --> 01:27:50,130
That's it for that one.

1037
01:27:50,130 --> 01:27:51,130
I need the other one now.

1038
01:27:51,130 --> 01:27:52,560
What?

1039
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:53,560
Oh, come on.

1040
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:54,560
Didn't get it.

1041
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:55,560
Come on, it's right there.

1042
01:27:55,560 --> 01:28:00,380
No!

1043
01:28:04,869 --> 01:28:11,869
I'm gonna die from these fumes.

1044
01:28:11,869 --> 01:28:18,960
I'm dead.

1045
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,140
I'm dead.

1046
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:29,479
Oh, god damn it.

1047
01:28:29,479 --> 01:28:30,479
This level sucks.

1048
01:28:30,479 --> 01:28:34,770
No, not next!

1049
01:28:34,770 --> 01:28:37,489
No, I gotta beat this guy!

1050
01:28:37,489 --> 01:28:57,789
I have to beat this guy.

1051
01:28:57,789 --> 01:28:59,029
The only thing is, where's the other...

1052
01:28:59,029 --> 01:29:01,369
It's gotta be the hand, right?

1053
01:29:01,369 --> 01:29:05,380
So it's his hand and his mouth.

1054
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:06,600
Sunk cost fallacy.

1055
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:24,689
wait to talk about some cost balancing before we get into a turn of flux burning seven mosquito

1056
01:29:24,689 --> 01:29:38,390
coils at the same time is roughly equivalent to burning 700 cigarettes that's insane okay now the
