1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:36,880
One of you, you guys are like doing different instruments.

2
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:45,880
We have to all just do that song in our own different ways with like different parts of the song and it's over Skype too so it's going to sound awful because it's not going to be synced.

3
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:55,570
Wait, you're saying, you want me, okay so I'll do the drums. I'm going to do the drums. Boo, what part do you want?

4
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,960
Wait, who's doing what now? You're doing the drums. I'm going to do the drums.

5
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:07,959
Dude, I don't even know that there's more than one part. It's just the song. That's all that that is.

6
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:11,959
Yeah, but we're going to make it our own thing. Do you know the concept of instruments?

7
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:18,959
Yeah, and it's just a saxophone. That's all that plays then. Saxophones? What?

8
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:23,959
That is not a saxophone. That's a trombone.

9
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:27,959
What do you call this? Is this like Bill Quinton? It's like a saxophone.

10
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:30,959
He said, I hope you guys don't mind if I pull this tank is effing slow.

11
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,959
Wait, I didn't even see that. Where did he write that? You're a liar.

12
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:38,959
He wrote that like two minutes ago. Oh, really? No, he didn't. I'm scrolling up.

13
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,959
Oh, he thinks he's like so funny, huh? We'll pull it. Okay, fine.

14
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:49,329
Not going fast enough for you? Sounds like a plan. Sure, we'll go.

15
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:53,329
You're just going to run to the end of the entrance. Run to the end of the dungeon.

16
00:01:53,329 --> 00:02:08,870
That's right. That fast enough for you. It did fast enough for you.

17
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:17,870
Let's let's hope we can actually like do this. Pull more is what he says. Yeah.

18
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,870
All right. It's not my fault. Get the boss. Don't get the boss. Don't get the boss.

19
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,870
Don't get the boss. We will actually wipe if you get the boss. I got the boss.

20
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:34,500
Oh, dude, why don't get the boss? Oh, you're attacking me, you dummy.

21
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:41,240
I don't have any mana. Oh, my God. What is draining my mana?

22
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:46,240
Dude, my mana is getting drained. I just divide shield. You guys are on your own.

23
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:53,240
Oh, great. Pain the asshole. Dude, for that entire duration, I had almost zero mana.

24
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:59,780
Well, that's why I can't heal the guy because he's a bad guy. You know, we should have just done.

25
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:09,990
Oh, we just killed him. He's dead. Wait a minute. What were we supposed to do?

26
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:18,409
He was attacking us. We just killed him. I don't think we were supposed to kill him.

27
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:23,409
He like Insta dropped. Hey, was that the guy that was complaining that I'm like a shitty tank?

28
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:34,729
I got out of it. I'm not ready. Don't pull. I got ready.

29
00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:54,289
All right. Hold on. We're going to mess with this guy a little bit. I'm going to stand here.

30
00:03:54,289 --> 00:04:03,180
Every dog is trapped on my carpet. I'm going to be like 45 minutes.

31
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:10,180
They would just be like 45 minutes. I would just get you would just vote to kick me and replace me.

32
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:19,980
I mean, that that is literally for anybody in that trinket. That trinket like sucks ass, by the way.

33
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:25,980
I think that thing is horrible.

34
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:30,980
That really is bad. I'm going to read this. I'm going to read this to you guys.

35
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,980
You know, we've like pulled a lot. Yeah, these guys are not elites.

36
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:40,779
So let me let me read this to you.

37
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:45,779
The worst drinking in the game. I'm going to read this to you in what I would assume somebody would be telling me.

38
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:51,529
This is how they would sell Ramstein's writing books.

39
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:58,529
Yeah, to drink it is press eight hit and harness the power of writing to dress down.

40
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:09,660
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

41
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:22,019
I was just like, kill us.

42
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:25,019
All right. Back to what was I saying here?

43
00:05:26,019 --> 00:05:30,459
Whatever. I just created one, two, three, four.

44
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:32,459
We're missing somebody. We're missing the hunter.

45
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:35,769
No, we're all in here. You don't know how to count one to.

46
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:38,769
Oh, if I keep you're not a pet. I keep thinking you're a freaking pet.

47
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:46,339
Let's go. Oh, get the Lord.

48
00:05:46,339 --> 00:05:55,829
Oh, it's done. This is the last box of the dungeon.

49
00:05:55,829 --> 00:06:01,810
The undertaker.

50
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:06,810
The undertaker.

51
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,240
Jesus Christ.

52
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:17,509
I got so worried about the undertaker.

53
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:18,509
Well, what's that? Give me that.

54
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:22,709
Have you guys done that blackout swordsman sling?

55
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:25,709
Oh, no, no, no. I'm not.

56
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:28,399
Thank God. This misery is over.

57
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:30,399
And then he leaves.

58
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:35,399
God, this misery is over.

59
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:41,959
Oh, well, that was a night.

60
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,959
That was a nice man.

61
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:47,779
Thank God. This misery is over.
