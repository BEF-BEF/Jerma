1
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,700
Hey, whoa.

2
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,700
Daba, atibatalo.

3
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,700
Ho ho.

4
00:08:46,700 --> 00:10:08,970
That's our family.

5
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:29,190
Let's see my armpits.

6
00:10:29,190 --> 00:12:23,179
So I'm not lifting my arms up.

7
00:12:23,179 --> 00:14:24,620
Woo.

8
00:14:24,620 --> 00:16:45,100
Yep.

9
00:16:45,100 --> 00:18:10,519
I can't believe we're gonna see like the lip I was just doing at the start.

10
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:24,839
Ho ho ho ho ho.

11
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:49,349
Woo. Just a little too big.

12
00:18:49,349 --> 00:21:08,299
Can't breathe without these.

13
00:21:08,299 --> 00:22:33,980
I can't believe we're gonna see like the lip I was just doing at the start.

14
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:40,250
Ho ho ho ho ho.

15
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:49,619
Woo.

16
00:22:49,619 --> 00:23:12,019
Just a little too big.

17
00:23:12,019 --> 00:23:14,019
Just a little too big.

18
00:23:14,019 --> 00:28:06,859
Ah.

19
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:20,220
I'm a streamer, buddy.

20
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,420
I'm a streamer, buddy. It's me, German985, here.

21
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,420
Just, um,

22
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,660
getting to my house that was just recently fixed

23
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,660
and upgraded, hopefully.

24
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:41,299
If I put too much pressure on it, it just...

25
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:43,539
Ow.

26
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:46,619
Uh...

27
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:50,759
How's everybody doing?

28
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:53,000
How's everybody doing?

29
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Hopefully, everybody's okay.

30
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Hopefully, everybody's feeling okay.

31
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Hopefully, everybody's doing okay.

32
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I am not

33
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,180
doing okay.

34
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,180
This is probably the worst I've ever felt

35
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,180
since...

36
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,480
I don't know. I don't have a barometer

37
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,480
for this because this is the worst ever.

38
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,750
Oh, yeah.

39
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,059
What do we got up here?

40
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:27,059
What's this? Wait, wait.

41
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:29,059
I got trapped in the wall.

42
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:31,059
I got trapped in the wall.

43
00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:34,259
I got stuck in the wall.

44
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:36,259
I can't...

45
00:29:36,259 --> 00:29:38,259
There it is. Okay, I got stuck back there.

46
00:29:38,259 --> 00:29:42,740
I got stuck in the wall.

47
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:47,480
What is this?

48
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:51,369
Ooh.

49
00:29:51,369 --> 00:29:54,180
I didn't know about this.

50
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,420
This looks like a staircase.

51
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,299
Oh, this is... I really like what they did here.

52
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:02,059
Ooh.

53
00:30:02,059 --> 00:30:04,940
Second floor.

54
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:08,309
Wow.

55
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:11,960
Interesting stuff.

56
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,960
I finished this one. This one wasn't finished.

57
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,140
I was going to hopefully do some of that

58
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,140
today.

59
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,140
Some work, but I don't

60
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,140
feel like doing any work right now.

61
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,890
They told me

62
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,890
that I can finish it however I wanted.

63
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:35,829
What else is up here?

64
00:30:35,829 --> 00:30:37,829
Oh, yes, the stuff

65
00:30:37,829 --> 00:30:39,829
I bought. Bed.

66
00:30:39,829 --> 00:30:42,390
Another bedroom.

67
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:45,210
This one gives me less

68
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,210
comfort than this one.

69
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:55,210
I look like Clark Kent.

70
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:57,450
But if he was smaller,

71
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:59,450
didn't go to law school, and never went

72
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:04,630
to the gym.

73
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,630
I look like fucking Otacon.

74
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:10,789
Yes, Snake.

75
00:31:10,789 --> 00:31:12,789
What you need to do is... But I'm not

76
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:14,789
smart enough to be that guy.

77
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:20,809
I like this bedroom though. Yay,

78
00:31:20,809 --> 00:31:23,369
ow. So if you guys that weren't

79
00:31:23,369 --> 00:31:25,369
here yesterday,

80
00:31:25,369 --> 00:31:27,369
the old house got kind of burnt,

81
00:31:27,369 --> 00:31:29,369
and we got some insurance money,

82
00:31:29,369 --> 00:31:31,369
which was immediately used to

83
00:31:31,369 --> 00:31:33,369
fix the damage and to upgrade

84
00:31:33,369 --> 00:31:37,660
the home.

85
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,660
So now we have two floors.

86
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,789
We've got a DIY room.

87
00:31:42,789 --> 00:31:45,160
And we've got all the other rooms that you've

88
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,039
seen already. Thank you.

89
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:50,039
Oh my god.

90
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:54,200
Now the thing about these stairs is they go down

91
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,200
pretty far. This is a very high, this is a very far

92
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,569
house. So it

93
00:31:58,569 --> 00:32:00,569
takes a few minutes to get down the stairs.

94
00:32:00,569 --> 00:32:04,279
Takes about 10 seconds. A very

95
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:07,289
big house. That was just huge.

96
00:32:07,289 --> 00:32:12,980
That's not the bathroom.

97
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,980
That's not the bathroom. I went

98
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:19,210
the wrong door. That's the wrong door.

99
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:21,210
I gotta go to the bathroom real

100
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:27,930
bad. Thank you.

101
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,970
Get out of here. I don't even want to use it.

102
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:51,289
I don't think I've washed my hands in a

103
00:32:51,289 --> 00:32:54,809
week and a half.

104
00:32:54,809 --> 00:32:56,809
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

105
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:58,809
Okay, is it healed yet?

106
00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:02,069
Let's find out.

107
00:33:02,069 --> 00:33:05,900
I feel better.

108
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:09,779
Can I get this off too?

109
00:33:11,779 --> 00:33:14,920
Oh shit, this is clipped on.

110
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,420
This is clipped on to my

111
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,420
body. It's gonna stay.

112
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,420
I just have bird shit on me.

113
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,420
Oh, thanks, seagull.

114
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,660
And by the way,

115
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,660
I know you like the robe. I know you do.

116
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:32,599
But I, uh,

117
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:34,599
it's too hot up here to wear this 24-7.

118
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:36,599
I'll put it on at other times, okay?

119
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:38,599
I really have a huge bird shit on me.

120
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:45,849
Can I put this somewhere

121
00:33:45,849 --> 00:33:47,849
that's way too hot to wear this?

122
00:33:47,849 --> 00:33:50,150
Do you know how hot it is?

123
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,150
I can't put this on.

124
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,150
And by the way, these

125
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,150
don't fit. I was

126
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:58,150
so concerned that these were gonna get picked

127
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:00,150
because they don't fit. It was,

128
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:02,150
it's a disaster.

129
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:04,150
So I'm gonna be walking around like this is a diaper.

130
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:07,220
What do you mean, wear the robe or

131
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:11,260
no food? Wear the robe,

132
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,260
hell about it. I can't see that today

133
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,260
to take my glasses off. No, no robe,

134
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:21,849
no food. Fine.

135
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:23,849
Here.

136
00:34:23,849 --> 00:34:27,559
Here's a souvenir.

137
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:29,559
Alright, I'll put the robe back on.

138
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:31,559
Uh, but if there's like an article written

139
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:33,559
later this afternoon about like

140
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:35,559
streamer dies of heatstroke on stream,

141
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:37,559
remember whose fault it was.

142
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,639
I guess I'll have a cookie.

143
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:55,539
Fresh baked cookies.

144
00:34:55,539 --> 00:34:57,539
Fresh baked cookies from

145
00:34:57,539 --> 00:34:59,539
eight days ago.

146
00:34:59,539 --> 00:35:06,699
Pretty good.

147
00:35:06,699 --> 00:35:09,769
It's not even good.

148
00:35:09,769 --> 00:35:15,699
You're like, this is dad.

149
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:17,699
Like dad, you're having like a sleepover,

150
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,699
like you come up, it's like two o'clock

151
00:35:19,699 --> 00:35:21,699
in the morning, you come out here, you're getting

152
00:35:21,699 --> 00:35:23,699
a snack for you and your friends and I'm dad.

153
00:35:23,699 --> 00:35:25,699
Like, oh, hey son.

154
00:35:25,699 --> 00:35:27,699
What's going on in there?

155
00:35:27,699 --> 00:35:29,699
You guys supposed to be asleep.

156
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:31,699
I keep hearing noises in there.

157
00:35:31,699 --> 00:35:34,519
You gotta cut that out son.

158
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:38,230
I got a big thesis

159
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:40,230
coming up next Monday.

160
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:43,739
Do you want some milk?

161
00:35:43,739 --> 00:35:48,969
Of course you don't.

162
00:35:48,969 --> 00:35:50,969
That was a good cookie.

163
00:35:50,969 --> 00:35:52,969
I love how cookie equals entire meal.

164
00:35:52,969 --> 00:35:56,420
One thing I had to make

165
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,420
really clear is eating

166
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,420
on this stream. Eating on

167
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,110
stream, right?

168
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:05,110
I can't eat like a full dinner every day.

169
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:07,110
I can't, what, you want me to eat like

170
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,110
a full plate of steak or something? No.

171
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:11,989
I'm gonna eat a cookie and I'm good.

172
00:36:11,989 --> 00:36:13,989
And like I have to finish the cookie, right?

173
00:36:13,989 --> 00:36:17,260
I can't just throw like a quarter

174
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:28,329
of a cookie away.

175
00:36:28,329 --> 00:36:31,460
Give me a shower.

176
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:34,280
Wait, wait.

177
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:44,840
Let's go for a shower.

178
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:49,059
With my glasses on.

179
00:36:49,059 --> 00:36:52,460
Hey, ask Reddit.

180
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,460
What's something you do

181
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,460
in the shower that like

182
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,460
people know and it's like we all know.

183
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,460
Oh man, I go in the shower with my glasses on all the time

184
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,460
and they fog up. Oh me too. Ten thousand up.

185
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:17,929
You know, I don't think

186
00:37:17,929 --> 00:37:19,929
there'll ever be one stream

187
00:37:19,929 --> 00:37:22,230
where we don't do like the fart is funny

188
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,659
joke. You know, I thought we could get

189
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:27,989
done. This is the third one.

190
00:37:27,989 --> 00:37:31,769
This is day three.

191
00:37:31,769 --> 00:37:34,010
But like, look, if it

192
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:36,010
gets bad, whatever.

193
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:38,010
How do I even describe, explain myself here?

194
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:55,349
At least I feel clean.

195
00:37:55,349 --> 00:37:59,130
Oh, I need to go.

196
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:02,840
I want to go to my bed.

197
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:06,360
I want to go in my bed.

198
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,460
Oh, these stairs. I don't even want

199
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:16,280
stairs. I want a

200
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,280
flat house where I can walk around in.

201
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:27,099
Oh, this is going to be fun,

202
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:29,099
but I don't want to do it.

203
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:32,789
What's that? What's that?

204
00:38:32,789 --> 00:38:34,030
What's that?

205
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:36,030
Sure about that at five dot com.

206
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:39,099
Sure about that at five dot com, official merchandise.

207
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:41,860
Don't go

208
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:47,420
and don't, don't go there.

209
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:51,260
Let me see if there are any butterflies.

210
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:55,360
Let me see if there are any butterflies.

211
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:01,179
Oh, look, there goes one.

212
00:39:01,179 --> 00:39:03,179
Oh, wow.

213
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:07,809
This looks like I'm trapped in here.

214
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,300
Like, hey, excuse me. I'm locked in here.

215
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,119
Can somebody help me?

216
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:17,000
Can you catch me a butterfly?

217
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I have to go outside.

218
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,500
I'm too tired.

219
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,500
I can't catch butterflies.

220
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,900
My robe got stuck.

221
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,900
Alright, I'll go catch butterflies.

222
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,610
Sleep would have been a great option.

223
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:45,260
You know, go to sleep.

224
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,559
But fine. I'll go and

225
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:49,559
catch a few butterflies. Like, I care. Whatever.

226
00:39:49,559 --> 00:40:02,019
I can make it. I can make it.

227
00:40:02,019 --> 00:40:04,780
I think I can make it. But no,

228
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,780
of course not.

229
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,780
I didn't even show you outside. I didn't even show you.

230
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,780
We can look at something else too. We can look at the pool.

231
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:22,300
I have a pool now.

232
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,300
I almost fell over. I had to just

233
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:28,460
ground myself for a second.

234
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:31,139
Otherwise, I would have puked.

235
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:33,579
We got a pool. And

236
00:40:33,579 --> 00:40:35,579
oh, cool. Oh,

237
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:39,219
yay. Ow, arm.

238
00:40:39,219 --> 00:40:43,820
Oh, butterflies.

239
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,820
Oh, my God.

240
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,820
Huge net for a butterfly.

241
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,179
What are we catching?

242
00:40:50,179 --> 00:40:52,679
Mothra?

243
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:56,010
From fucking Godzilla?

244
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:58,010
Oh, I think I got one.

245
00:41:02,019 --> 00:41:04,019
I didn't know that was still turned on.

246
00:41:04,019 --> 00:41:06,019
Oh, cool. Butterflies.

247
00:41:06,019 --> 00:41:08,019
What songs do butterflies like?

248
00:41:08,019 --> 00:41:11,929
One bit me in the neck.

249
00:41:11,929 --> 00:41:19,719
Ow.

250
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:21,719
That's a pool.

251
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:43,340
This is a fucking other one.

252
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:48,579
Big house. I gotta get to bed right now.

253
00:41:48,579 --> 00:41:50,889
I'm so tired.

254
00:41:50,889 --> 00:41:53,829
Just need one night's sleep of good

255
00:41:53,829 --> 00:41:57,539
rest in a bed.

256
00:41:57,539 --> 00:41:59,539
That's all I need. That's all I want.

257
00:41:59,539 --> 00:42:02,809
Okay.

258
00:42:02,809 --> 00:42:12,139
The bed is

259
00:42:12,139 --> 00:42:14,139
calling me. It's screaming at me.

260
00:42:22,019 --> 00:48:53,690
I feel great.

261
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:55,690
What a good night's sleep. Holy smokes.

262
00:48:55,690 --> 00:49:00,579
Oh, man.

263
00:49:00,579 --> 00:49:02,579
I feel like I could write a book. I feel like I could write a

264
00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:04,579
play. I feel like I could write a novel. I feel like I could go for a jog.

265
00:49:04,579 --> 00:49:06,579
Oh, I feel fucking incredible.

266
00:49:06,579 --> 00:49:08,579
Damn what a good night's sleep can do

267
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:10,579
for you. And a good food.

268
00:49:10,579 --> 00:49:12,579
All that good stuff.

269
00:49:12,579 --> 00:49:14,579
It's coming off.

270
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:22,760
It's clipped into the microphone.

271
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,760
At some point, we're gonna have to

272
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:28,980
actually do something about this.

273
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:30,980
Oh, I feel good though.

274
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:36,099
What a day.

275
00:49:36,099 --> 00:49:38,099
Projects. Mystery box.

276
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:40,409
What's in here? Why is there a mystery box

277
00:49:40,409 --> 00:49:45,340
up here? Sounds like a pretty

278
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:50,139
good day to check the mail. I got up a little

279
00:49:50,139 --> 00:49:54,360
too fast and I almost just burped.

280
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,360
I created a bunch of gas

281
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,360
when I just came up really quickly.

282
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,360
And yeah, I almost just burped on camera.

283
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:12,380
Let's check the mail.

284
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:14,380
I feel so good. I could probably even come out backwards.

285
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:18,710
I can.

286
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:20,710
Why don't we do it here too? Bet you I can come out backwards.

287
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:33,559
Oh, shit.

288
00:50:33,559 --> 00:50:43,670
That's new, whatever it is.

289
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:45,670
There's a piece of mail in here.

290
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:47,670
It's probably one of these kids in the

291
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:50,039
neighborhood. What does it say?

292
00:50:50,039 --> 00:50:55,929
It says, Jerma, thank you

293
00:50:55,929 --> 00:50:57,929
for involving us in such a unique experience.

294
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,929
We have had the time of our lives.

295
00:50:59,929 --> 00:51:01,929
The crew.

296
00:51:01,929 --> 00:51:07,219
I actually wrote that.

297
00:51:07,219 --> 00:51:09,219
I actually wrote that. That's actually really nice.

298
00:51:09,219 --> 00:51:11,219
Without a crew like this,

299
00:51:11,219 --> 00:51:13,219
this is not possible.

300
00:51:13,219 --> 00:51:15,219
This is by far one of the coolest things I've ever done.

301
00:51:15,219 --> 00:51:17,219
And by far some of the best people I've

302
00:51:17,219 --> 00:51:19,219
ever worked with in my whole life. And I really mean

303
00:51:19,219 --> 00:51:22,099
that. All of you.

304
00:51:22,099 --> 00:51:24,340
There's tons of people back here, tons of people backstage.

305
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:26,340
You can't even see them.

306
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:29,289
But clean this shit up.

307
00:51:33,619 --> 00:51:36,179
Oh, a unicorn.

308
00:51:36,179 --> 00:51:41,280
Wow.

309
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,280
Oh, it's huge.

310
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,280
Oh, what? Oh, dude.

311
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,280
Stone cold.

312
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,889
Stunner.

313
00:51:51,889 --> 00:51:53,889
Don't hurt him. Don't hurt him. I'm not. He's fine.

314
00:51:53,889 --> 00:51:58,050
Pool.

315
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:01,119
I can't wait to potentially go swimming in

316
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:03,119
that pool with absolute

317
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:05,360
water in it. You know, fun

318
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,360
fact for those of you behind the scenes stuff.

319
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,360
There's supposed to be water in there.

320
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,360
It's supposed to be a full pool. But last minute

321
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,360
we decided,

322
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,360
what an absolute dangerous hazard

323
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,360
considering there is a transformer

324
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,360
right there.

325
00:52:29,139 --> 00:52:38,739
I love it though. I do feel

326
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:40,739
good though. This is a good day.

327
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:51,940
Go to work. You got it.

328
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:58,320
I'm in such a good mood.

329
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,320
Hey, can you queue up? Can you queue up like

330
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,320
somebody gets like fucking speared sound?

331
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,619
Can you queue up like somebody gets like

332
00:53:04,619 --> 00:53:06,619
shing like speared sound?

333
00:53:06,619 --> 00:53:08,619
Could you get that right now?

334
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:12,079
Okay. I want like a

335
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:14,079
skewed up spear sound. Somebody gets hit with a spear and they get like

336
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:17,730
ugh. I know.

337
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:19,730
Hold on. I'll be right there.

338
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:22,219
Hey.

339
00:53:22,219 --> 00:53:24,219
Hey, thanks a lot to the crew.

340
00:53:32,670 --> 00:57:20,750
I'm coming. Thank you. Eventually I will get a car

341
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:23,119
I promise. One day. I don't know when.

342
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:35,460
Thanks for the ride.

343
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:38,530
Oh shit. I hit somebody.

344
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:40,530
Oh my god. I actually hit somebody with the fucking

345
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:42,699
javelin. Are you all right?

346
00:57:42,699 --> 00:57:45,460
I mean I threw it as hard as I

347
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:47,460
could. I didn't know you were going to be that far away.

348
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:50,699
Is he all right?

349
00:57:50,699 --> 00:57:53,010
Is he okay?

350
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:55,010
I see a lot of blood coming out of here.

351
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:57,010
It's like profusely.

352
00:57:57,010 --> 00:57:59,380
What if we get medical on him?

353
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:01,619
Is he okay?

354
00:58:01,619 --> 00:58:04,369
Okay. Why would you stand

355
00:58:04,369 --> 00:58:08,719
in the way? I mean I knew I had a good arm

356
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:10,719
but I'm cheating.

357
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:13,789
You know what I mean?

358
00:58:13,789 --> 00:58:15,789
That's a classic fucking comedy joke.

359
00:58:15,789 --> 00:58:18,659
All right.

360
00:58:18,659 --> 00:58:20,659
That was a good day at work.

361
00:58:20,659 --> 00:58:23,150
I am kind of gross.

362
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:25,150
I mean look. I've got a pool back here.

363
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:28,929
I don't even need your choice.

364
00:58:28,929 --> 00:58:30,929
I want to go in the pool.

365
00:58:30,929 --> 00:58:33,619
Look. We got it out here. I'm going to use it.

366
00:58:33,619 --> 00:58:37,579
It's been a long day at work.

367
00:58:37,579 --> 00:58:40,139
I'm going to get in the pool.

368
00:58:40,139 --> 00:58:44,300
Just turn it off. Otherwise I fucking won't

369
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:48,849
stop touching it.

370
00:58:48,849 --> 00:58:52,619
Okay. I can wear

371
00:58:52,619 --> 00:58:55,179
the same clothes. It doesn't matter.

372
00:58:55,179 --> 00:59:00,219
Cold. Cold.

373
00:59:00,219 --> 00:59:02,460
That's the thing. You just got to go right in.

374
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,829
Okay. I'm just going in.

375
00:59:04,829 --> 00:59:11,019
That feels good.

376
00:59:11,019 --> 00:59:16,900
Oh.

377
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:23,809
Muglerberry do one of these?

378
00:59:23,809 --> 00:59:29,099
I think so.

379
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:36,059
That feels good.

380
00:59:36,059 --> 00:59:40,980
You know

381
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,980
something about cold water

382
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:44,980
that just really gets into your

383
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:46,980
head. It opens up your blood vessels

384
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:48,980
or closes them. I don't know.

385
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:50,980
Either one of those two things. It does one of them.

386
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:59,019
All right.

387
00:59:59,019 --> 01:00:35,599
What? What happened?

388
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:37,599
I feel like I was still alive but something happened there.

389
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:40,030
I feel like

390
01:00:40,030 --> 01:00:46,690
that was a long day at work. That was really weird.

391
01:00:46,690 --> 01:00:48,929
I kind of just

392
01:00:48,929 --> 01:00:51,489
felt like I stopped my head.

393
01:00:51,489 --> 01:00:53,489
It was like a split second. My head felt like

394
01:00:53,489 --> 01:00:56,110
it was

395
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:58,110
my head froze but it was only

396
01:00:58,110 --> 01:01:00,610
a second. I don't know.

397
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:05,780
Where's the ladder?

398
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:09,619
What? I'm actually having fun though.

399
01:01:09,619 --> 01:01:11,619
I'm having a fun time. What happened to the ladder?

400
01:01:11,619 --> 01:01:15,389
Where's the

401
01:01:15,389 --> 01:01:24,210
ladder?

402
01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:26,210
Where's the ladder?

403
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:28,579
I have to get out of the pool.

404
01:01:28,579 --> 01:01:30,579
I don't want to be in here all day.

405
01:01:30,579 --> 01:01:33,710
I've got shit to do.

406
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:36,019
Help! Somebody help me!

407
01:01:36,019 --> 01:01:41,010
Somebody help me!

408
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:43,630
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Come back!

409
01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:45,630
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!

410
01:01:45,630 --> 01:01:47,630
Get in the pool! Get in the pool!

411
01:01:47,630 --> 01:01:49,869
Get in the pool and help me! Get in the pool!

412
01:01:49,869 --> 01:01:51,869
Get in the pool!

413
01:01:51,869 --> 01:01:54,429
There's someone in the pool that needs help.

414
01:01:54,429 --> 01:01:56,860
I think they took the ladder over there.

415
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:58,860
You idiot AI piece of shit!

416
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:02,829
Hey! Hey!

417
01:02:02,829 --> 01:02:06,420
Don't eat anything!

418
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:10,960
Don't eat anything!

419
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,389
What's he doing?

420
01:02:13,389 --> 01:02:16,780
Is he in my bathroom?

421
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:18,780
He's still drinking beer! I can tell!

422
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:20,780
That's all people do in my house is drink

423
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:24,239
beer out of the fridge!

424
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:26,239
Put the ladder back, put the ladder back. You can put the ladder back if you want.

425
01:02:26,239 --> 01:02:28,670
You should put the ladder back.

426
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:32,960
I want to get out of the pool!

427
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,710
I want to get out of the pool!

428
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:39,679
I want to get out of the pool!

429
01:02:39,679 --> 01:02:52,340
Put the ladder back.

430
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:23,619
Well, has someone

431
01:03:23,619 --> 01:03:25,619
gone for a little swim

432
01:03:25,619 --> 01:03:27,619
without his

433
01:03:27,619 --> 01:03:29,619
floaties?

434
01:03:29,619 --> 01:03:31,619
It's me, your old friend Death

435
01:03:31,619 --> 01:03:33,619
who puts the fun

436
01:03:33,619 --> 01:03:36,050
in funeral. Come on

437
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:45,059
now. It's time.

438
01:03:47,059 --> 01:03:49,059
Oh yes.

439
01:03:49,059 --> 01:03:51,059
It's time for the midnight

440
01:03:51,059 --> 01:03:53,059
train to the long farewell.

441
01:03:53,059 --> 01:03:55,059
No! No! What?

442
01:03:55,059 --> 01:03:57,059
You killed me!

443
01:03:57,059 --> 01:03:59,059
Why did you take the ladder out?

444
01:03:59,059 --> 01:04:01,059
It's a funny

445
01:04:01,059 --> 01:04:03,059
joke, isn't it? Until it's dead.

446
01:04:03,059 --> 01:04:05,059
Are you blaming someone else

447
01:04:05,059 --> 01:04:07,059
when you decided to get in without

448
01:04:07,059 --> 01:04:09,059
a life jacket?

449
01:04:09,059 --> 01:04:12,829
You're right.

450
01:04:12,829 --> 01:04:14,829
Okay. Am I dead?

451
01:04:14,829 --> 01:04:16,829
Am I dead now?

452
01:04:16,829 --> 01:04:18,829
Oh, you're very, very dead.

453
01:04:18,829 --> 01:04:20,829
Oh, wait a minute. I could have just gone like

454
01:04:20,829 --> 01:04:22,829
this.

455
01:04:22,829 --> 01:04:27,380
Oh!

456
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:29,380
Unfortunately, no givesies

457
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:32,900
backsies.

458
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:34,900
Someone! Have you made

459
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:36,900
all of your preparations? I have

460
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:38,900
and I just...

461
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:41,460
You look

462
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:43,460
wonderful today.

463
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:45,699
Can I just tell you that?

464
01:04:45,699 --> 01:04:47,699
The scythe, the uniform,

465
01:04:47,699 --> 01:04:49,699
something about the way, the mysterious,

466
01:04:49,699 --> 01:04:51,699
the dark, mysterious

467
01:04:51,699 --> 01:04:53,699
stranger. You know, usually

468
01:04:53,699 --> 01:04:55,699
when people flirt with Death, it's something

469
01:04:55,699 --> 01:04:57,699
simpler like blowfish sushi.

470
01:04:57,699 --> 01:04:59,699
Right. This is a bit complicated.

471
01:04:59,699 --> 01:05:01,699
Are you...

472
01:05:01,699 --> 01:05:03,699
Do you mean it when you say that?

473
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:05,699
Or are you saying that because you saw me?

474
01:05:05,699 --> 01:05:07,699
I mean, I mean it. I do.

475
01:05:07,699 --> 01:05:09,699
I think that I...

476
01:05:09,699 --> 01:05:11,699
Would you like to come inside? Maybe?

477
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:13,699
Do we have to go immediately

478
01:05:13,699 --> 01:05:15,699
or can we have a drink? Can we hang out?

479
01:05:15,699 --> 01:05:17,699
This is kind of... Listen,

480
01:05:17,699 --> 01:05:19,699
I have a hot dog eating contest and I've got

481
01:05:19,699 --> 01:05:21,699
three souls to take in about 20 minutes.

482
01:05:21,699 --> 01:05:23,699
Okay.

483
01:05:23,699 --> 01:05:25,699
It's unconventional, but this once.

484
01:05:25,699 --> 01:05:27,699
I'll allow it.

485
01:05:27,699 --> 01:05:29,699
Okay, great. Come on in.

486
01:05:29,699 --> 01:05:31,699
I feel... Is that normal?

487
01:05:31,699 --> 01:05:33,699
Should I be doing that? That is normal.

488
01:05:36,059 --> 01:05:38,059
Usually it's a bit more crying,

489
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:41,840
screaming.

490
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,840
I've been crying, it feels like for fucking three days,

491
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,840
Death. That's alright.

492
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:47,840
Time to see your uncle Ted.

493
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:49,840
Isn't that fun after all?

494
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,840
I didn't even know that.

495
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:53,840
I thought he was dead like a year.

496
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,840
I already got a spot picked out for you.

497
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,840
Okay.

498
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,840
Well, I really do think you're

499
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:01,840
a very, very, very handsome, Death.

500
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:03,840
Oh, stop.

501
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:05,840
Stop. You don't mean that.

502
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:07,840
I do. I do mean it.

503
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:10,340
Come on in here.

504
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:14,110
Why is he in here?

505
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:19,420
Hey, I just want to let you know

506
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:21,420
it's probably...

507
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:23,420
Thanks for the help, by the way.

508
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:25,730
You did a great job,

509
01:06:25,730 --> 01:06:27,730
by the way.

510
01:06:27,730 --> 01:06:29,730
Officer of the law, of the court.

511
01:06:29,730 --> 01:06:31,730
Keep doing as best as you can.

512
01:06:31,730 --> 01:06:34,349
Watching TV.

513
01:06:34,349 --> 01:06:36,349
Making good friends in the neighborhood,

514
01:06:36,349 --> 01:06:38,349
are we? Yes, we are making

515
01:06:38,349 --> 01:06:40,349
very good friends in the neighborhood.

516
01:06:40,349 --> 01:06:42,349
That's a garage back there.

517
01:06:42,349 --> 01:06:44,780
Sorry, I don't want you to see my garage.

518
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:46,780
It's full of filthy, filthy stuff.

519
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:48,780
Are you trying to waste my time?

520
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:50,780
Filthy thing. Come on up here

521
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:52,780
into my room, Death.

522
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:54,780
I'll show you my poster. I've got some pretty cool posters.

523
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:58,239
Watch your step, though.

524
01:06:58,239 --> 01:07:00,239
Wow, a little dark back here.

525
01:07:00,239 --> 01:07:02,239
It is kind of dark, yeah. I've got to get some lighting.

526
01:07:02,239 --> 01:07:04,610
I just moved in.

527
01:07:04,610 --> 01:07:06,610
I just moved in about today,

528
01:07:06,610 --> 01:07:08,610
yesterday, actually.

529
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:10,610
Boy, quick turnaround, huh?

530
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:12,610
Yeah, it's crazy.

531
01:07:12,610 --> 01:07:14,610
You all right?

532
01:07:14,610 --> 01:07:17,360
I can tell I'm going to be making more than one visit here.

533
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:19,360
An entire stairwell

534
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,789
and no lights.

535
01:07:21,789 --> 01:07:23,789
I'm Death, of course I'm all right.

536
01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:25,969
He doesn't even feel pain. He's Death.

537
01:07:25,969 --> 01:07:28,340
How about this room? You like it?

538
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:33,329
It's a little minimalist.

539
01:07:33,329 --> 01:07:35,329
Well, it's

540
01:07:35,329 --> 01:07:37,329
going to be upgraded.

541
01:07:37,329 --> 01:07:39,329
It's going to be upgraded really soon.

542
01:07:39,329 --> 01:07:41,329
Probably in the near future.

543
01:07:41,329 --> 01:07:43,329
Interesting decor choice.

544
01:07:43,329 --> 01:07:45,329
Yes, if you'd like to look at the bedroom, it's up here.

545
01:07:45,329 --> 01:07:47,329
I can give you a full tour.

546
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:49,329
It's a work in progress.

547
01:07:49,329 --> 01:07:51,329
It's a work in progress.

548
01:07:51,329 --> 01:07:53,630
So in here,

549
01:07:53,630 --> 01:07:55,630
I've got two beds for fun.

550
01:07:55,630 --> 01:07:57,630
I don't know. They decided to give it to me.

551
01:07:57,630 --> 01:08:00,059
So what was your last

552
01:08:00,059 --> 01:08:02,059
where were you before this?

553
01:08:02,059 --> 01:08:04,059
Right before this? Yeah, like right before you

554
01:08:04,059 --> 01:08:06,059
came in and got me. Carnival ride

555
01:08:06,059 --> 01:08:08,059
accident Kentucky.

556
01:08:08,059 --> 01:08:10,059
One of those small

557
01:08:10,059 --> 01:08:12,059
cars roller coasters.

558
01:08:12,059 --> 01:08:14,059
They tried to fit four people into one.

559
01:08:14,059 --> 01:08:16,060
You know how it goes.

560
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:18,060
That's unfortunate. Two people choked on

561
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:20,060
churros.

562
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:22,060
In the audience? Oh, yes.

563
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:24,060
Dead right away. I feel like

564
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:26,060
you've got a lot of places to be.

565
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:28,060
Oh, I've got appointments all

566
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:30,060
day. So no days off

567
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:32,060
for death. How many people die a day?

568
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:34,060
How many people die a day? That's classified.

569
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:36,060
Okay, it's probably

570
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:38,060
I'm going to give you a number. Is it more or less than

571
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:40,060
100,000? Yes.

572
01:08:40,060 --> 01:08:42,060
It is more or less than that number.

573
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:44,060
Okay, so

574
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:46,060
outside you can see we've got a pretty good view.

575
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:48,060
A beautiful view of the outside. Oh, lovely.

576
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:50,060
Yeah, it's pretty nice. Are all those

577
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:52,060
butterflies common in this area?

578
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:54,060
They're actually huge. I don't know, but you can make yourself comfortable.

579
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:56,060
Do you want a snack or something?

580
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:58,060
There's plenty of room to hang out if you want to.

581
01:08:58,060 --> 01:09:00,060
Snack? I'm actually, I mean, I'm just trying

582
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:02,060
to. When do we go

583
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:04,060
to the other side? Oh,

584
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:06,060
very soon. Very soon.

585
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:08,060
Very soon. Okay, well, I'm

586
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:14,340
it's a what scene?

587
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:18,500
It's the what scene.

588
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,500
You said a W word.

589
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:23,180
W word?

590
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:27,180
Oh, okay.

591
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:29,180
Death,

592
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:31,180
I don't know how you feel about potentially

593
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:33,180
have you heard the word, word woohoo

594
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:35,180
before? Woohoo.

595
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:37,180
You and I are potentially on a date

596
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:39,180
here. I can't say that woohoo

597
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:41,180
is a part of my normal vocabulary

598
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:43,180
as death. Not a lot of

599
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:45,180
woohoo in the underworld.

600
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:47,180
It's more like

601
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:51,729
ah! Generally

602
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:53,729
speaking. Oh,

603
01:09:53,729 --> 01:09:55,729
so would you like to spend an evening together?

604
01:09:55,729 --> 01:09:57,729
Is what I'm asking.

605
01:09:57,729 --> 01:09:59,729
Would you

606
01:09:59,729 --> 01:10:01,729
still respect me if I said yes?

607
01:10:01,729 --> 01:10:03,729
Absolutely.

608
01:10:03,729 --> 01:10:09,100
I guess we're doing this.

609
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:11,100
Shall we?

610
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:13,100
Allow me.

611
01:10:17,579 --> 01:10:19,579
I'm going to put the robe on.

612
01:10:19,579 --> 01:10:21,579
I'm going to show you the time

613
01:10:21,579 --> 01:10:23,579
of your life.

614
01:10:23,579 --> 01:10:25,579
Okay, that sounds good to me.

615
01:10:25,579 --> 01:10:27,579
So how is this

616
01:10:27,579 --> 01:10:29,579
going to work? You're not going to, do I like

617
01:10:29,579 --> 01:10:31,579
die? Am I dead?

618
01:10:31,579 --> 01:10:33,579
I'm going to tell you right now it's something you'll

619
01:10:33,579 --> 01:10:35,579
never forget. Okay,

620
01:10:35,579 --> 01:10:37,579
alright, I'm into this too.

621
01:10:37,579 --> 01:10:39,579
Death, you know

622
01:10:39,579 --> 01:10:41,579
I've been known to

623
01:10:41,579 --> 01:10:43,579
go for at least two to three minutes.

624
01:10:43,579 --> 01:10:45,579
Wow, record breaker.

625
01:10:45,579 --> 01:10:48,909
This is nice.

626
01:10:48,909 --> 01:10:53,899
This is nice.

627
01:10:53,899 --> 01:10:55,899
Okay, let's get

628
01:10:55,899 --> 01:10:58,529
together.

629
01:10:58,529 --> 01:11:00,529
Come on.

630
01:11:00,529 --> 01:11:02,529
Dude, be shy.

631
01:11:06,529 --> 01:11:12,289
Somebody's at the door.

632
01:11:12,289 --> 01:11:14,289
Somebody's at the door.

633
01:11:14,289 --> 01:11:16,289
Hold on,

634
01:11:16,289 --> 01:11:18,289
somebody's at the door.

635
01:11:18,289 --> 01:11:20,289
That was wonderful.

636
01:11:20,289 --> 01:11:22,289
Stay up here.

637
01:11:22,289 --> 01:11:24,289
Stay up here.

638
01:11:24,289 --> 01:11:26,289
Don't make yourself a known enemy.

639
01:11:26,289 --> 01:11:31,859
I can't go back to bed.

640
01:11:31,859 --> 01:11:36,079
Just

641
01:11:36,079 --> 01:11:38,079
get under there.

642
01:11:38,079 --> 01:11:40,079
Just stay under there. Just cover yourself up.

643
01:11:40,079 --> 01:11:42,079
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

644
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:47,199
Just cover yourself.

645
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:49,810
I'm in the bedroom.

646
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:53,010
Who is it?

647
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:55,250
Jerma, I'm in the bedroom.

648
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:57,550
Oh, um,

649
01:11:57,550 --> 01:11:59,550
I guess, okay.

650
01:11:59,550 --> 01:12:03,649
You come up, it's through the hallway.

651
01:12:03,649 --> 01:12:05,649
Hey, Amelia.

652
01:12:05,649 --> 01:12:07,649
Sorry.

653
01:12:07,649 --> 01:12:09,649
What? Amelia,

654
01:12:09,649 --> 01:12:11,649
how are you? Who is that?

655
01:12:11,649 --> 01:12:14,140
That's just a bunch of pillows.

656
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:16,140
That's just a bunch of pillows.

657
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:18,140
It's a collection of moving

658
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:20,140
sentient pillows.

659
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:22,140
This is a standing pillow now.

660
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:24,140
Am I meant to believe

661
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:26,140
because I'm a stupid maid that this is a sentient

662
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:28,140
pillow that's dead?

663
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:30,140
No, no, no, no.

664
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:32,140
Oh, he's got a side. Dad, what are you doing about that?

665
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:34,140
He's got a side. He's got your side.

666
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:36,140
Why did you stand me up on our date

667
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:38,140
and now this?

668
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:40,140
Look, you have no idea. My life has been an absolute

669
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:42,140
train ride. People come to the house, organ players.

670
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:44,140
I've had like police here three times.

671
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:46,140
A police officer was here like an hour ago just drinking on my couch.

672
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:48,140
This sounds really tough for you

673
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:50,140
that someone was drinking on your couch.

674
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:52,140
No, you don't understand. It wasn't even

675
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:54,140
my decision. It was easy for me to get

676
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:56,140
stood up and I can't believe this.

677
01:12:56,140 --> 01:12:58,140
You can take this. You can take him.

678
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:00,140
You shitter. No, no.

679
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:02,140
I hope it was nice. Amelia, just wait, wait, wait, wait.

680
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:04,140
No, no.

681
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:06,140
You missed your chance.

682
01:13:06,140 --> 01:13:08,140
You don't know how high

683
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:10,449
I can fly.

684
01:13:14,479 --> 01:13:18,260
How high?

685
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:20,500
Amelia! This has been great.

686
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:22,500
It's just a little tense for me.

687
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:24,500
I've got that hot dog eating contest. Listen,

688
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:26,500
I'm just gonna go.

689
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:28,500
You don't call me, I'll call you.

690
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:30,500
Okay?

691
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:32,500
Just gotta go. Wish I could talk.

692
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:34,500
Have to go.

693
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,500
So nice. I actually don't want you to call me.

694
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:38,500
I want you to lose my number because I don't want to hear from you because that means a bad thing.

695
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:40,500
Oh, don't worry. I'll come calling.

696
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,500
You just won't know when.

697
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:45,420
Jesus.

698
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:48,369
I got my life back.

699
01:13:48,369 --> 01:13:50,609
I feel like

700
01:13:50,609 --> 01:13:52,609
I've had a big life, but I gotta

701
01:13:52,609 --> 01:13:56,449
hold on. I need to

702
01:13:56,449 --> 01:13:58,449
Amelia, god damn it.

703
01:13:58,449 --> 01:14:00,449
I didn't want to stand anybody up.

704
01:14:00,449 --> 01:14:02,449
It's not even my decision if I stand

705
01:14:02,449 --> 01:14:04,449
somebody up or not. Did you understand?

706
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:08,750
It's not my choice if somebody's

707
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:12,529
Amelia!

708
01:14:12,529 --> 01:14:14,529
Amelia!

709
01:14:14,529 --> 01:14:18,289
Just wait. Amelia,

710
01:14:18,289 --> 01:14:20,289
hold on. It takes 30 seconds to come down

711
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:24,260
the stairs. Amelia!

712
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:31,090
Oh, no. Amelia!

713
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:33,949
Oh, crap.

714
01:14:33,949 --> 01:14:35,949
Oh, crap.

715
01:14:35,949 --> 01:14:41,970
Amelia! Oh, that was a voice

716
01:14:41,970 --> 01:14:43,970
crack and it was bad.

717
01:14:43,970 --> 01:14:46,140
It was the worst one I've ever done.

718
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:54,460
What a disaster.

719
01:14:54,460 --> 01:15:04,560
What a day. Oh, right. I turned it

720
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:08,850
off. Right. That's not, I didn't

721
01:15:08,850 --> 01:15:13,579
want that to happen.

722
01:15:13,579 --> 01:15:28,479
Damn. What a wild day.

723
01:15:28,479 --> 01:15:31,470
Well, here's

724
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:33,470
something for you guys.

725
01:15:33,470 --> 01:15:35,470
If you kill me,

726
01:15:35,470 --> 01:15:37,470
you need to be ready for the consequences.

727
01:15:37,470 --> 01:16:00,060
Catch butterflies!

728
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:02,060
I don't even know how I threw it at somebody.

729
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:04,060
Is he all right? Can I get it from him? Can I get it from

730
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:06,060
him?

731
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:08,060
Can you give me the thing that I threw at the crew

732
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:10,060
member? Yeah, just toss it over here.

733
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:12,060
Yeah. Thank you.

734
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:14,060
Thanks, appreciate it.

735
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:20,060
Catch butterflies.

736
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:27,619
I'm falling full. I can't get out of there.

737
01:16:27,619 --> 01:16:35,539
Did I get any? I don't

738
01:16:35,539 --> 01:16:37,539
even know. I don't even like everything. I don't know what they look like.

739
01:16:37,539 --> 01:16:45,659
I'm so tired.

740
01:16:45,659 --> 01:16:47,659
Please, send me to bed.

741
01:16:47,659 --> 01:16:57,760
Thank you.

742
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:59,760
It's so far away.

743
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:02,060
It's so far away.

744
01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:04,060
It's so far away. Why do I have such a big house?

745
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:06,060
It's too far away.

746
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:14,430
I can

747
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:16,739
get there. I can get

748
01:17:16,739 --> 01:17:23,460
there. Let's go upstairs.

749
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:25,760
Okay. Two, three,

750
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,760
four, five. I can't.

751
01:17:27,760 --> 01:25:49,180
Whoa. Oh, that's been

752
01:25:49,180 --> 01:25:51,939
digging into my neck. Oh,

753
01:25:51,939 --> 01:25:53,939
it's been digging into my neck the whole

754
01:25:53,939 --> 01:25:56,619
night. Ah, one of these

755
01:25:56,619 --> 01:25:59,119
staircase things. Oh,

756
01:25:59,119 --> 01:26:05,760
ugh. There's this like

757
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,760
deep purple blood here.

758
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,760
What is that?

759
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:12,829
Why is it like purple blood?

760
01:26:12,829 --> 01:26:19,789
Ugh. My glasses all in all night.

761
01:26:19,789 --> 01:26:23,550
Ow.

762
01:26:23,550 --> 01:26:25,550
I'm going to have this permanent just kink in

763
01:26:25,550 --> 01:26:31,630
my neck. And remember,

764
01:26:31,630 --> 01:26:36,369
Germanite85.com.

765
01:26:36,369 --> 01:26:38,989
If you want to get your visit,

766
01:26:38,989 --> 01:26:40,989
I don't even care. I fucking tear it down.

767
01:26:40,989 --> 01:26:42,989
I don't even want it. I'm going to

768
01:26:42,989 --> 01:26:46,880
want it.

769
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:48,880
You can decide for yourself if you want to go to

770
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:50,880
Germanite85.com and get merchandise

771
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,880
especially specifically for this show.

772
01:26:52,880 --> 01:27:02,289
I feel awful.

773
01:27:02,289 --> 01:27:09,010
I just feel like this sucks.

774
01:27:09,010 --> 01:27:13,680
Oh, yes.

775
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:19,810
Oh, it's a Dachshund.

776
01:27:19,810 --> 01:27:22,939
Oh, it's Otto.

777
01:27:22,939 --> 01:27:26,140
It's an Otto.

778
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:28,699
Oh,

779
01:27:28,699 --> 01:27:31,520
and it's my ladybug friend from

780
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:33,819
the first, from two

781
01:27:33,819 --> 01:27:36,380
weeks ago. I'm going to say

782
01:27:36,380 --> 01:27:38,380
first stream because then we're going to

783
01:27:38,380 --> 01:27:41,140
have continuity.

784
01:27:41,140 --> 01:27:43,140
Oh, I love them.

785
01:27:43,140 --> 01:27:45,140
I actually love them. And wait, is this one of those

786
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:48,270
things I can go like this?

787
01:27:48,270 --> 01:27:50,270
What? Holy shit. Get this on fucking

788
01:27:50,270 --> 01:27:54,750
camcorder.

789
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:58,529
Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?

790
01:27:58,529 --> 01:28:01,279
Are you kidding me?

791
01:28:01,279 --> 01:28:03,579
I love them. They're fantastic.

792
01:28:03,579 --> 01:28:05,579
Oh, they're so cool.

793
01:28:05,579 --> 01:28:07,579
They're going to go

794
01:28:07,579 --> 01:28:10,270
in my bed. They're going to go

795
01:28:10,270 --> 01:28:13,710
in my bed. In my bed.

796
01:28:13,710 --> 01:28:16,399
I don't want to go too far.

797
01:28:16,399 --> 01:28:21,069
This one. Wait, look at this.

798
01:28:21,069 --> 01:28:26,000
It's a magic trick for you.

799
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:44,859
I'm starting to feel that up here in the throat. I have to pee

800
01:28:44,859 --> 01:28:54,529
so bad.

801
01:28:54,529 --> 01:28:56,529
I'm going to pee with or without the robe.

802
01:28:56,529 --> 01:28:59,920
I'm just tell...

803
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:01,920
Look, I'm just saying.

804
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:06,739
I'm just saying.

805
01:29:06,739 --> 01:29:10,829
Hot dog. I'm just saying.

806
01:29:10,829 --> 01:29:19,539
If it allows me to go to the bathroom, I'll

807
01:29:19,539 --> 01:29:21,539
put it on. Hold on.

808
01:29:21,539 --> 01:29:26,659
I'm going to go down the stairs.

809
01:29:26,659 --> 01:29:28,659
I'll put it on. It'll be on by the time

810
01:29:28,659 --> 01:29:30,659
you see me next, I promise.

811
01:29:36,210 --> 01:29:38,210
Put the robe on. Get heat stroke.

812
01:29:38,210 --> 01:29:41,470
We want robe, but no bathroom.

813
01:29:41,470 --> 01:29:45,760
Wrong door.

814
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:51,329
This is the one I'm supposed to go in.

815
01:29:51,329 --> 01:29:55,489
Okay.

816
01:29:55,489 --> 01:30:13,149
Who is calling me?

817
01:30:15,460 --> 01:30:17,460
Who is calling my phone?

818
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:19,460
Oh my god.

819
01:30:19,460 --> 01:30:31,170
Hey, this is Jason again calling

820
01:30:31,170 --> 01:30:33,170
from Dealer Warranty Services,

821
01:30:33,170 --> 01:30:35,170
licensed representatives of

822
01:30:35,170 --> 01:30:37,170
Car Extended Vehicle Purchase

823
01:30:37,170 --> 01:30:39,170
Points LLC calling.

824
01:30:39,170 --> 01:30:41,170
Looks like you've

825
01:30:41,170 --> 01:30:43,170
been dodging a couple of my phone calls.

826
01:30:43,170 --> 01:30:45,170
We sent you a bunch of things in the mail,

827
01:30:45,170 --> 01:30:47,170
a couple emails,

828
01:30:47,170 --> 01:30:49,170
a couple fax machines,

829
01:30:49,170 --> 01:30:51,170
even got your grandma in on the thing.

830
01:30:51,170 --> 01:30:53,170
But for some reason, you just don't

831
01:30:53,170 --> 01:30:55,170
seem to want to get back to me about

832
01:30:55,170 --> 01:30:57,170
your vehicle's extended warranty.

833
01:30:57,170 --> 01:30:59,170
Are you trying to drive

834
01:30:59,170 --> 01:31:01,170
unsafe?

835
01:31:01,170 --> 01:31:03,170
Do you want your car

836
01:31:03,170 --> 01:31:05,170
to explode?

837
01:31:05,170 --> 01:31:07,170
At this point, I'm starting to

838
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:09,170
be a little concerned.

839
01:31:09,170 --> 01:31:13,380
You know, phone calls

840
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:15,380
are starting to become like

841
01:31:15,380 --> 01:31:17,380
email. Have you noticed that?

842
01:31:17,380 --> 01:31:19,619
When was the last time you answered the telephone?

843
01:31:19,619 --> 01:31:21,619
If mom wasn't

844
01:31:21,619 --> 01:31:23,619
the contact that came up.

845
01:31:23,619 --> 01:31:27,199
I have not answered my actual

846
01:31:27,199 --> 01:31:29,199
cell phone unless

847
01:31:29,199 --> 01:31:31,199
MOM is on the goddamn

848
01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:33,500
fucking thing.

849
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:35,500
It's becoming spam email now.

850
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:37,500
Nobody answers their phone, nobody checks their

851
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:39,500
email. How do we communicate with anybody?

852
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:53,819
I wasn't done.

853
01:31:53,819 --> 01:32:06,100
I wasn't done. Hold on.

854
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:10,270
I'm gonna need a little more than that.

855
01:32:10,270 --> 01:32:12,270
I'm gonna need a little more than that.

856
01:32:14,579 --> 01:32:16,579
I'm gonna need a little bit more than that.

857
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:38,449
It's in. Yes.

858
01:32:38,449 --> 01:32:50,210
Show up!

859
01:32:50,210 --> 01:32:53,020
This is fucked.

860
01:32:53,020 --> 01:32:55,020
This is from screaming for three straight days.

861
01:32:55,020 --> 01:33:00,779
Show up!

862
01:33:02,779 --> 01:33:12,109
Get those bars

863
01:33:12,109 --> 01:33:14,930
up. Otherwise, I'm

864
01:33:14,930 --> 01:33:18,960
gonna be in trouble.

865
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:20,960
Glasses. Reddit.

866
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:23,199
Ten thousand.

867
01:33:23,199 --> 01:33:27,039
Upload.

868
01:33:35,859 --> 01:33:37,859
And you know the pose we're doing.

869
01:33:37,859 --> 01:33:42,699
Told you. Told you.

870
01:33:42,699 --> 01:33:45,649
I'm hungry. Very hungry.

871
01:33:45,649 --> 01:33:50,449
Exceptional. I gotta clean this up.

872
01:33:50,449 --> 01:33:52,449
What happened here?

873
01:33:52,449 --> 01:33:57,250
Look at this. What a mess.

874
01:33:57,250 --> 01:34:01,340
This looks awesome.

875
01:34:01,340 --> 01:34:03,340
Awesome? Looks awful.

876
01:34:03,340 --> 01:34:06,159
Make food

877
01:34:06,159 --> 01:34:08,159
but I have to have the robot to make food.

878
01:34:08,159 --> 01:34:11,550
Well, can't we just say who cares

879
01:34:11,550 --> 01:34:13,550
and I can just do whatever I want?

880
01:34:13,550 --> 01:34:15,550
Can I break away from their control

881
01:34:15,550 --> 01:34:17,550
at some point? Okay.

882
01:34:17,550 --> 01:34:22,289
Sure. Put the robot.

883
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:35,300
This is so hot with this

884
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:37,300
on. Can I go like this?

885
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:39,300
No, no, it's just a

886
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:41,300
snuggie.

887
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:45,329
Oh yeah, snuggie.

888
01:34:45,329 --> 01:34:48,079
Oh, my mic. I gotta be

889
01:34:48,079 --> 01:34:54,539
holding on. I'll go like this. I feel

890
01:34:54,539 --> 01:34:56,539
like this is like a fashion trend right

891
01:34:56,539 --> 01:34:58,539
now, right? Is it like a dress that people

892
01:34:58,539 --> 01:35:00,979
wear that looks like this? With like

893
01:35:00,979 --> 01:35:02,979
a tall turtop and it's like this?

894
01:35:02,979 --> 01:35:05,470
Right? Don't you think that'd be huge?

895
01:35:05,470 --> 01:35:07,470
And it goes into a dress?

896
01:35:07,470 --> 01:35:10,289
I think I found

897
01:35:10,289 --> 01:35:12,289
look, if you're a designer

898
01:35:12,289 --> 01:35:14,289
and you make this, I want

899
01:35:14,289 --> 01:35:16,909
ten percent. It goes around all the

900
01:35:16,909 --> 01:35:18,909
way back, yeah. All right, food.

901
01:35:18,909 --> 01:35:24,100
Making food is just annoying and I'm

902
01:35:24,100 --> 01:35:26,100
not doing it. It's been three days. So what is

903
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:47,340
eating a cookie? Not until I

904
01:35:47,340 --> 01:35:49,340
I'm not dealing with this shit until I eat.

905
01:36:01,359 --> 01:36:05,140
Fuck this thing off!

906
01:36:05,140 --> 01:36:07,500
What? We're here on behalf

907
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:09,500
of the king. On what

908
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:11,500
king? King Elton

909
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:13,500
McCartney, the conqueror of the fifth.

910
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:15,869
As you

911
01:36:15,869 --> 01:36:18,750
plans, you must read the

912
01:36:18,750 --> 01:36:20,750
scroll. I need to read the

913
01:36:20,750 --> 01:36:22,750
scroll?

914
01:36:22,750 --> 01:36:24,750
Do we expect you to pledge

915
01:36:24,750 --> 01:36:26,750
fealty to the king?

916
01:36:26,750 --> 01:36:28,750
If not, there will be dire

917
01:36:28,750 --> 01:36:30,750
consequences. I don't know what drugs

918
01:36:30,750 --> 01:36:32,750
are going around this neighborhood, but it's something hard.

919
01:36:32,750 --> 01:36:34,750
Pledge-eth, fealty-eth,

920
01:36:34,750 --> 01:36:36,750
or you'll be severeth.

921
01:36:36,750 --> 01:36:38,750
So you're going to kill

922
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:40,750
me if I don't pledge fealty? What's fealty?

923
01:36:40,750 --> 01:36:42,750
Pledge fealty to the king for

924
01:36:42,750 --> 01:36:44,750
five hundred shillings. Five hundred

925
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:46,750
shillings? Is that money?

926
01:36:46,750 --> 01:36:53,409
My youngest kid, Agatha,

927
01:36:53,409 --> 01:36:55,649
she needs braces.

928
01:36:55,649 --> 01:36:57,949
We don't have fucking parents. The king doesn't do that.

929
01:36:57,949 --> 01:36:59,949
Wait, say that one more time.

930
01:36:59,949 --> 01:37:01,949
My daughter needs braces now. I've been on this job for like a fucking

931
01:37:01,949 --> 01:37:03,949
month, dude. This is my fourth

932
01:37:03,949 --> 01:37:05,949
appointment. I'm going to cut you a break.

933
01:37:05,949 --> 01:37:07,949
Who sent you here, though? Was it like a joke or something?

934
01:37:07,949 --> 01:37:09,949
No, I'm here on behalf of the king. And

935
01:37:09,949 --> 01:37:11,949
the thing is, if you don't pay, I get to sever your head.

936
01:37:11,949 --> 01:37:13,949
I don't know if you've ever used one of these. It's kind of dull. It takes a little bit of time.

937
01:37:13,949 --> 01:37:15,949
That hurt, actually. I've done three today. I'm fucking

938
01:37:15,949 --> 01:37:17,949
tired, bro. Just pay me like five hundred shillings

939
01:37:17,949 --> 01:37:19,949
that's like, you know, 20, 21, 200 bucks.

940
01:37:19,949 --> 01:37:21,949
You look like shit. You're not even that big.

941
01:37:21,949 --> 01:37:23,949
I can literally cut your fucking head off

942
01:37:23,949 --> 01:37:25,949
right now, and I don't want to. My arm's exhausted.

943
01:37:25,949 --> 01:37:27,949
I've got a torn rotator cuff. I know, but you

944
01:37:27,949 --> 01:37:29,949
look like shit, and I fucking, I could probably beat you up.

945
01:37:29,949 --> 01:37:31,949
I could probably punch you in the face and kill you.

946
01:37:31,949 --> 01:37:33,949
Loser. Loser. That poked me in the eye.

947
01:37:33,949 --> 01:37:35,949
You're really going to do this?

948
01:37:35,949 --> 01:37:37,949
Can you just cut me a fucking break? How much money do you need?

949
01:37:37,949 --> 01:37:39,949
I told you it's five hundred shillings.

950
01:37:39,949 --> 01:37:41,949
Who is this? Who is this guy?

951
01:37:41,949 --> 01:37:45,090
That's not your concern, person.

952
01:37:45,090 --> 01:37:50,079
Are you going to pay or not? Look,

953
01:37:50,079 --> 01:37:52,640
if you want five hundred bucks from me,

954
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:54,640
then I'm going to have to hear a goddamn

955
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:56,640
song from this motherfucker right here.

956
01:37:56,640 --> 01:37:58,880
You want five hundred?

957
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:01,310
You're not in a position

958
01:38:01,310 --> 01:38:03,310
to decide if, who plays,

959
01:38:03,310 --> 01:38:08,180
to flute if. I want to hear a

960
01:38:08,180 --> 01:38:10,180
song, don't I? Doesn't everybody else?

961
01:38:10,180 --> 01:38:18,350
My music sucks.

962
01:38:18,350 --> 01:38:20,350
You both suck. You're both idiots.

963
01:38:20,350 --> 01:38:22,529
You both, you're both like probably,

964
01:38:22,529 --> 01:38:24,529
you probably both stupid. You probably fucking have a thirty

965
01:38:24,529 --> 01:38:26,529
IQ. Very well!

966
01:38:26,529 --> 01:38:28,529
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't

967
01:38:28,529 --> 01:38:30,529
No, no, no. I was told to do that.

968
01:38:30,529 --> 01:38:32,529
Somebody said do that. Who? There's no one here.

969
01:38:32,529 --> 01:38:34,529
Yes, there is. They're up in the sky.

970
01:38:34,529 --> 01:38:36,529
I see if no one is. Play, just tell them to play again.

971
01:38:36,529 --> 01:38:41,199
Okay, five hundred.

972
01:38:41,199 --> 01:38:43,199
Will five hundred get you to leave?

973
01:38:43,199 --> 01:38:45,199
Okay, get some music, get some music

974
01:38:45,199 --> 01:38:47,630
before I look like an idiot.

975
01:38:47,630 --> 01:38:49,630
Is it decided?

976
01:38:49,630 --> 01:38:51,630
Yes, take five hundred and leave.

977
01:38:51,630 --> 01:38:53,630
Then we're an alliance.

978
01:38:53,630 --> 01:38:57,149
We're an alliance?

979
01:38:57,149 --> 01:38:59,149
You're not going to hurt me, are you?

980
01:38:59,149 --> 01:39:01,149
I want to put your head out so I can appreciate it and celebrate.

981
01:39:01,149 --> 01:39:04,350
What are you doing? You're not...

982
01:39:04,350 --> 01:39:06,590
You can't just take beers out of the fridge.

983
01:39:06,590 --> 01:39:08,590
What is it? What?

984
01:39:08,590 --> 01:39:10,590
This neighborhood, I swear to God,

985
01:39:10,590 --> 01:39:12,590
everybody is on fucking hard drugs.

986
01:39:12,590 --> 01:39:14,590
What are you doing?

987
01:39:14,590 --> 01:39:16,590
I toasted the king!

988
01:39:16,590 --> 01:39:18,770
No, uh...

989
01:39:18,770 --> 01:39:28,100
There's nothing left...

990
01:39:28,100 --> 01:39:30,100
This time next year.

991
01:39:30,100 --> 01:39:35,220
Watch the phone.

992
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:37,220
There's nothing left in here. He drank it all.

993
01:39:37,220 --> 01:39:40,220
This is the guy that comes in.

994
01:39:40,220 --> 01:39:42,220
He's the guy that comes in and drinks a beer really fast.

995
01:39:42,220 --> 01:39:44,220
That's his thing.

996
01:39:44,220 --> 01:39:51,460
That's his thing that he does.

997
01:39:51,460 --> 01:39:53,699
Hey, do you know a guy that can drink beer real fast?

998
01:39:53,699 --> 01:39:55,699
Uh...

999
01:39:55,699 --> 01:39:57,939
Yeah.

1000
01:39:57,939 --> 01:40:00,239
Yeah, I know a guy that can drink beer real fast.

1001
01:40:00,239 --> 01:40:02,239
This thing is gross.

1002
01:40:02,239 --> 01:40:07,170
I'm putting this in the sink.

1003
01:40:07,170 --> 01:40:09,170
And you left my door open!

1004
01:40:09,170 --> 01:40:11,170
Pledge fealty to the king.

1005
01:40:11,170 --> 01:40:13,170
Well, I hope your daughter got the braces.

1006
01:40:13,170 --> 01:40:15,170
Unbelievable.

1007
01:40:15,170 --> 01:40:17,729
They have a cop here.

1008
01:40:17,729 --> 01:40:20,420
I think the cop is on drugs too.

1009
01:40:20,420 --> 01:40:22,420
Nobody here is...

1010
01:40:22,420 --> 01:40:24,420
Nobody here is sober, okay?

1011
01:40:24,420 --> 01:40:26,420
There's like a bunch of people doing drugs.

1012
01:40:26,420 --> 01:40:28,420
I'm the only sober one in this whole neighborhood.

1013
01:40:28,420 --> 01:40:31,100
But that's not actually accurate

1014
01:40:31,100 --> 01:40:33,100
because I've had like three of those.

1015
01:40:33,100 --> 01:40:35,710
Can I get the bread off the ground at least?

1016
01:40:37,710 --> 01:40:39,710
King Arthur, what is he doing here?

1017
01:40:41,710 --> 01:40:43,710
Why is he like a flute player?

1018
01:40:51,579 --> 01:40:53,579
Hey, do you know a guy that can drink beer real fast?

1019
01:40:53,579 --> 01:40:56,779
What is this?

1020
01:40:56,779 --> 01:41:01,329
Oh, he left it.

1021
01:41:01,329 --> 01:41:03,630
I'm watching some TV.

1022
01:41:03,630 --> 01:41:12,640
I'm gonna put the tube on.

1023
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:17,699
Alright, what do we got on TV?

1024
01:41:17,699 --> 01:41:19,699
Don't show the TV yet!

1025
01:41:19,699 --> 01:41:21,699
Don't show the TV yet!

1026
01:41:21,699 --> 01:41:23,699
I wouldn't show the television yet.

1027
01:41:23,699 --> 01:41:26,319
I think I need to hit the input button

1028
01:41:26,319 --> 01:41:30,670
to get this to the right channel.

1029
01:41:30,670 --> 01:41:32,670
Okay, I gotta make sure...

1030
01:41:32,670 --> 01:41:34,670
Look, this got installed the other day.

1031
01:41:34,670 --> 01:41:37,739
Alright, what's on TV?

1032
01:41:37,739 --> 01:41:40,989
Let's get ourselves on.

1033
01:41:40,989 --> 01:41:47,260
That's a lot of feedback from a microphone.

1034
01:41:47,260 --> 01:41:49,630
What do we got? What's on TV?

1035
01:41:49,630 --> 01:41:53,149
What's on TV?

1036
01:41:53,149 --> 01:41:55,149
Channel change on here.

1037
01:41:55,149 --> 01:41:59,500
Turn it on.

1038
01:41:59,500 --> 01:42:01,500
This is a weird channel.

1039
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:03,500
You guys can call 1-800-SEXYMAD

1040
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:05,500
That's S-E-X-Y-M-A-D

1041
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:07,500
We ran out of numbers.

1042
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:09,500
To get my service.

1043
01:42:09,500 --> 01:42:11,500
It costs $2,000 per cleaning

1044
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:13,500
or $2,500 if...

1045
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:15,680
You want me to wear cat ears?

1046
01:42:15,680 --> 01:42:17,680
Or $150 if you're a giant piece of shit

1047
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:19,680
named Jerma

1048
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:21,680
Change the channel!

1049
01:42:21,680 --> 01:42:23,680
I don't want to see that. Change the channel.

1050
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:25,680
What's this?

1051
01:42:51,890 --> 01:42:53,890
Change the channel!

1052
01:42:53,890 --> 01:42:55,890
Giant piece of shit!

1053
01:42:55,890 --> 01:42:57,890
Change the channel again!

1054
01:42:57,890 --> 01:42:59,890
Change the channel again!

1055
01:42:59,890 --> 01:43:01,890
Change channel! Change channel!

1056
01:43:01,890 --> 01:43:04,579
Nothing on this one.

1057
01:43:04,579 --> 01:43:07,460
There's nothing on this station.

1058
01:43:07,460 --> 01:43:09,460
There's nothing on this station.

1059
01:43:09,460 --> 01:43:11,460
Or are they just doing dead air on this station?

1060
01:43:11,460 --> 01:43:15,100
Change channel!

1061
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:17,100
This thing's messed up.

1062
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:19,100
There it is!

1063
01:43:19,100 --> 01:43:21,100
So if you want to join our church

1064
01:43:21,100 --> 01:43:23,100
you're welcome to come down and join us

1065
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:25,100
every Sunday at 4.

1066
01:43:25,100 --> 01:43:27,100
We are also streaming live.

1067
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:29,100
You can check us out anytime online.

1068
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:33,100
We also fully expect your support financially.

1069
01:43:33,100 --> 01:43:35,100
So please make sure you give us your credit card numbers.

1070
01:43:35,100 --> 01:43:37,100
Alright, get that off.

1071
01:43:40,689 --> 01:43:42,689
TV off!

1072
01:43:42,689 --> 01:43:54,000
He's screaming.

1073
01:43:54,000 --> 01:44:04,239
He's screaming!

1074
01:44:06,239 --> 01:44:08,800
Man, TV is weird out here.

1075
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:11,100
It seems to be only two or three stations.

1076
01:44:11,100 --> 01:44:13,100
It must be an antenna.

1077
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:15,600
What happened to this?

1078
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:20,189
What is that?

1079
01:44:20,189 --> 01:44:22,189
There's three channels on that TV.

1080
01:44:22,189 --> 01:44:25,840
I don't even want to pick it up.

1081
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:27,840
And I'm not touching that

1082
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:29,840
because there's poo poo on it.

1083
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:34,750
Oh my god, there's like beer everywhere.

1084
01:44:34,750 --> 01:44:36,750
This is actually kind of a disaster.

1085
01:44:36,750 --> 01:44:40,140
This is going to get actually cleaned.

1086
01:44:40,140 --> 01:44:42,140
Ugh.

1087
01:44:42,140 --> 01:44:44,449
Interesting.

1088
01:44:44,449 --> 01:44:47,500
Here's the beer stein.

1089
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:49,500
Whatever you want to call this.

1090
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:52,260
Let's rinse it out.

1091
01:44:52,260 --> 01:44:55,390
Yuck.

1092
01:44:55,390 --> 01:45:00,939
Ugh. Disgusting.

1093
01:45:00,939 --> 01:45:07,970
I'm going up into the bed.

1094
01:45:07,970 --> 01:45:12,060
I want to sit down.

1095
01:45:12,060 --> 01:45:14,060
There's just a soda.

1096
01:45:14,060 --> 01:45:17,649
There's a non-descript soda over there.

1097
01:45:17,649 --> 01:45:19,649
I want to check out the DIY room.

1098
01:45:19,649 --> 01:45:21,649
Because what does that mean?

1099
01:45:21,649 --> 01:45:23,649
DIY room. Do it yourself.

1100
01:45:23,649 --> 01:45:29,409
DIY?

1101
01:45:29,409 --> 01:45:31,409
I don't want to stream right now.

1102
01:45:31,409 --> 01:45:38,750
I've got a lot going on.

1103
01:45:38,750 --> 01:45:40,750
How am I going to stream on Twitch?

1104
01:45:43,869 --> 01:45:49,760
Okay.

1105
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:51,760
Where's the mouse and keyboard?

1106
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:54,130
Where is the mouse?

1107
01:45:54,130 --> 01:45:56,369
Am I still banned on Twitch?

1108
01:45:56,369 --> 01:46:00,140
I don't think so.

1109
01:46:00,140 --> 01:46:04,239
Alright, starting the stream.

1110
01:46:04,239 --> 01:46:07,250
I've got to apologize to everybody.

1111
01:46:07,250 --> 01:46:09,250
Let me go live. It's been like four or five days

1112
01:46:09,250 --> 01:46:11,250
since I got banned like twice.

1113
01:46:11,250 --> 01:46:13,810
I've got to apologize.

1114
01:46:13,810 --> 01:46:17,460
Make sure I look okay.

1115
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:19,460
I've got to look hot in this video, right?

1116
01:46:19,460 --> 01:46:24,449
Because that's what matters, not the apology.

1117
01:46:24,449 --> 01:46:26,449
I've got to make sure I look good.

1118
01:46:26,449 --> 01:46:31,810
Okay.

1119
01:46:31,810 --> 01:46:42,100
Let's go live.

1120
01:46:42,100 --> 01:46:44,100
Hey, what's up everybody?

1121
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:46,399
Jerma985 here.

1122
01:46:46,399 --> 01:46:48,399
I know over the last couple of weeks I've been live

1123
01:46:48,399 --> 01:46:50,399
only a few times.

1124
01:46:50,399 --> 01:46:52,399
And it's been

1125
01:46:52,399 --> 01:46:54,399
for only like two or three minutes.

1126
01:46:54,399 --> 01:46:56,399
And then I go BRB.

1127
01:46:56,399 --> 01:46:59,020
I'll be right back.

1128
01:46:59,020 --> 01:47:15,279
Hey everybody, it's Jerma985 here.

1129
01:47:15,279 --> 01:47:17,279
I just want to get some good

1130
01:47:17,279 --> 01:47:19,279
comfortable clothes for this stream.

1131
01:47:19,279 --> 01:47:21,279
Because, you know, it's important

1132
01:47:21,279 --> 01:47:23,279
stuff we're talking about here. I have to apologize

1133
01:47:23,279 --> 01:47:26,029
real quick.

1134
01:47:26,029 --> 01:47:28,029
I've been away.

1135
01:47:28,029 --> 01:47:30,029
And I've been not good to you.

1136
01:47:30,029 --> 01:47:32,029
And you may have seen some things

1137
01:47:32,029 --> 01:47:34,029
on the stream. Me sleeping. You may have seen

1138
01:47:34,029 --> 01:47:36,029
me shitting on stream a few times and going to the bathroom

1139
01:47:36,029 --> 01:47:38,029
on stream. But I want to say I don't condone

1140
01:47:38,029 --> 01:47:40,029
going to the bathroom on stream. I find

1141
01:47:40,029 --> 01:47:42,029
it disgusting and repulsive.

1142
01:47:42,029 --> 01:47:44,029
And I find that anybody that would do that

1143
01:47:44,029 --> 01:47:46,029
would be completely out of their mind.

1144
01:47:46,029 --> 01:47:48,029
I don't condone it.

1145
01:47:48,029 --> 01:47:50,029
And it's not me. It's me from a while ago.

1146
01:47:50,029 --> 01:47:52,029
It's a past me. I just want to say that I'm sorry

1147
01:47:52,029 --> 01:47:54,029
about my past me that would have actually gone

1148
01:47:54,029 --> 01:47:56,029
to the bathroom on stream.

1149
01:47:56,029 --> 01:47:58,029
And that would have gone BRB and gone to sleep.

1150
01:47:58,029 --> 01:48:01,300
That's not me.

1151
01:48:01,300 --> 01:48:03,300
That's not me. I would, I mean,

1152
01:48:03,300 --> 01:48:05,300
that's not me. As of a week ago, that's not me. I'm a new

1153
01:48:05,300 --> 01:48:07,300
person. I mean, it was a week ago.

1154
01:48:07,300 --> 01:48:09,300
It was a week ago. But it's not me.

1155
01:48:09,300 --> 01:48:11,300
That's not who I am. I also want to say

1156
01:48:11,300 --> 01:48:13,300
very, very much sorry to

1157
01:48:13,300 --> 01:48:15,300
Al, Migraine, to Amelia.

1158
01:48:15,300 --> 01:48:17,300
What? I want to say sorry to Amelia.

1159
01:48:17,300 --> 01:48:19,300
Because they didn't

1160
01:48:19,300 --> 01:48:21,300
deserve that kind of treatment. And I really feel

1161
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:23,300
like that they, that I really just want

1162
01:48:23,300 --> 01:48:25,300
to say sorry to them. They saw me

1163
01:48:25,300 --> 01:48:27,300
having sex

1164
01:48:27,300 --> 01:48:29,300
with death in my bed.

1165
01:48:29,300 --> 01:48:31,300
And I just want to say that that's not

1166
01:48:31,300 --> 01:48:33,300
me. That's not me. That's not who I am.

1167
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:35,300
I don't have sex with like three different

1168
01:48:35,300 --> 01:48:37,300
people and like lie to everybody. As of a

1169
01:48:37,300 --> 01:48:39,300
week ago. It was three days ago. But that's not me.

1170
01:48:39,300 --> 01:48:41,300
That's not who I am.

1171
01:48:41,300 --> 01:48:43,300
I woohooed him.

1172
01:48:43,300 --> 01:48:45,300
We can't say that word.

1173
01:48:45,300 --> 01:48:51,569
Or can we?

1174
01:48:51,569 --> 01:48:53,569
I woohooed! Woohooed!

1175
01:48:53,569 --> 01:48:55,569
It's not the same! It's not

1176
01:48:55,569 --> 01:48:57,569
the same thing, Chad. Woohoo

1177
01:48:57,569 --> 01:48:59,569
is a different term.

1178
01:48:59,569 --> 01:49:01,569
Although I just really screwed up and said

1179
01:49:01,569 --> 01:49:03,569
something else. Woohoo's

1180
01:49:03,569 --> 01:49:05,569
different. It's different. We woohooed.

1181
01:49:05,569 --> 01:49:07,569
We both said woohoo. We had a great

1182
01:49:07,569 --> 01:49:09,569
time. And look, I'm sorry.

1183
01:49:09,569 --> 01:49:11,569
I'm sorry. I'm apologizing for that. Let me apologize for the

1184
01:49:11,569 --> 01:49:13,569
apology, too. I'm very sorry about that

1185
01:49:13,569 --> 01:49:15,569
apology. How I said something else that wasn't

1186
01:49:15,569 --> 01:49:17,569
what we did. We were upstairs.

1187
01:49:17,569 --> 01:49:19,569
We rolled around. We went, whoa! Woohoo!

1188
01:49:19,569 --> 01:49:21,569
And that's it. That's all that happened. That's

1189
01:49:21,569 --> 01:55:45,949
it.

1190
01:55:45,949 --> 01:55:48,189
I'm really sorry for apologizing for the

1191
01:55:48,189 --> 01:55:50,500
apology. For this time, I mean it.

1192
01:55:50,500 --> 01:55:52,500
I know you might,

1193
01:55:52,500 --> 01:55:54,500
some of you might think I'm like a shitty person, but

1194
01:55:54,500 --> 01:55:56,739
I don't care.

1195
01:55:56,739 --> 01:55:58,739
You paid me a lot of money, so I don't care.

1196
01:55:58,739 --> 01:56:00,739
But like, you know, I'm

1197
01:56:00,739 --> 01:56:02,739
just going to do this to make sure everybody's happy about it.

1198
01:56:02,739 --> 01:56:06,510
I'm sure everybody's

1199
01:56:06,510 --> 01:56:08,510
happy about that.

1200
01:56:08,510 --> 01:56:10,510
I'm sorry that I said the S

1201
01:56:10,510 --> 01:56:12,510
word. The S word.

1202
01:56:12,510 --> 01:56:14,510
S-E. I can't even say it. Oh, it's

1203
01:56:14,510 --> 01:56:16,510
not me. Sorry, I'm not that person.

1204
01:56:16,510 --> 01:56:18,510
S-E. Oh, I can't say it. You know what I mean?

1205
01:56:18,510 --> 01:56:20,510
Like, that's not me from yesterday.

1206
01:56:20,510 --> 01:56:22,510
From when I went to sleep that time.

1207
01:56:22,510 --> 01:56:24,510
I can't even say that word. Oh, I can't even say it anymore.

1208
01:56:24,510 --> 01:56:26,510
It's fucking disgusting to me.

1209
01:56:26,510 --> 01:56:28,510
But yeah, I'm really

1210
01:56:28,510 --> 01:56:30,510
sorry about that, and

1211
01:56:30,510 --> 01:56:33,140
what? I've been permanently

1212
01:56:33,140 --> 01:56:35,140
banned from Twitch.

1213
01:56:35,140 --> 01:56:38,460
Permanently. Indefinitely.

1214
01:56:38,460 --> 01:56:41,520
But indefinite

1215
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:44,210
means like,

1216
01:56:44,210 --> 01:56:46,210
no, I'll just record an apology

1217
01:56:46,210 --> 01:56:48,210
video, and then I'll send it to Twitch.

1218
01:56:48,210 --> 01:56:50,960
Twitch. I'm going to record an apology

1219
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:53,579
video. Hey,

1220
01:56:53,579 --> 01:56:55,890
get the OBS out.

1221
01:56:55,890 --> 01:56:58,640
Get over here.

1222
01:56:58,640 --> 01:57:00,880
No, not with a toilet.

1223
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:02,880
I'm going to be stupid. Don't be dumb.

1224
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:04,880
Oh yeah, sorry

1225
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:06,880
Twitch. Please appeal the ban

1226
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:08,880
in front of a toilet. Pink

1227
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:14,060
background's fine. Hey, Twitch.

1228
01:57:14,060 --> 01:57:16,060
It's me, Jerma, here. I just wanted to appeal

1229
01:57:16,060 --> 01:57:18,060
the ban that I had.

1230
01:57:18,060 --> 01:57:20,560
I was on a lot of drugs,

1231
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:22,560
and I didn't mean any of those

1232
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:24,560
things.

1233
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:29,229
Delete that.

1234
01:57:29,229 --> 01:57:33,140
Hey. Delete it again.

1235
01:57:33,140 --> 01:57:36,720
Start over. Hey, Twitch.

1236
01:57:36,720 --> 01:57:38,720
It's me, Jerma985 here. I just

1237
01:57:38,720 --> 01:57:40,720
wanted to make sure I check in with you and see that I got a permanent

1238
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:42,720
indefinite kind of ban.

1239
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:44,720
What you saw the last few days,

1240
01:57:44,720 --> 01:57:46,720
it's been kind of crazy.

1241
01:57:46,720 --> 01:57:48,720
A gladiator came in and was like threatening to

1242
01:57:48,720 --> 01:57:50,720
kill me, and I'm going to start over

1243
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:52,720
again. Again, one more time.

1244
01:57:52,720 --> 01:57:55,789
Make sure to look taller and bigger, because

1245
01:57:55,789 --> 01:57:57,789
the minion you were presenting, get the robe off too.

1246
01:57:57,789 --> 01:58:04,899
Hey, Twitch. It's me,

1247
01:58:04,899 --> 01:58:06,899
Jerma985 here. Just wanted to

1248
01:58:06,899 --> 01:58:08,899
give you a quick update of

1249
01:58:08,899 --> 01:58:10,899
what happened over the last few days and appeal the ban.

1250
01:58:10,899 --> 01:58:12,899
Um, I

1251
01:58:12,899 --> 01:58:14,899
was attacked by a bear a couple times.

1252
01:58:14,899 --> 01:58:18,800
I don't care. Whatever. Fuck it.

1253
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:20,800
I'm banned forever. Don't care.

1254
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:53,170
Or I do. Twitch,

1255
01:58:53,170 --> 01:58:55,170
I got hacked, and somebody posted on

1256
01:58:55,170 --> 01:58:57,170
my behalf, and it wasn't even me.

1257
01:58:57,170 --> 01:58:59,170
So I'm sorry about it.

1258
01:58:59,170 --> 01:59:02,539
Send that email. Send.

1259
01:59:02,539 --> 01:59:04,539
Send. I'm going to take a shower.

1260
01:59:04,539 --> 01:59:17,069
What am I going to do about money?

1261
01:59:17,069 --> 01:59:19,760
What am I going to do?

1262
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:21,760
Why is the water not working?

1263
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:24,579
Fuck. How am I

1264
01:59:24,579 --> 01:59:27,010
going to get paid?

1265
01:59:27,010 --> 01:59:30,529
What am I supposed to do?

1266
01:59:30,529 --> 01:59:33,659
I brush my teeth in the shower

1267
01:59:33,659 --> 01:59:35,970
every day.

1268
01:59:35,970 --> 01:59:37,970
That was a quick shower.

1269
01:59:37,970 --> 01:59:39,970
That was a quick shower. What was that?

1270
01:59:43,039 --> 01:59:45,039
You know the move. You know the move.

1271
01:59:45,039 --> 02:00:03,260
My arm

1272
02:00:03,260 --> 02:00:05,260
still hurts from the window.

1273
02:00:05,260 --> 02:00:20,100
From Twitch.

1274
02:00:20,100 --> 02:00:22,100
It's not even funny.

1275
02:00:22,100 --> 02:00:29,199
It's not even funny.

1276
02:00:29,199 --> 02:00:31,199
Watch TV.

1277
02:00:31,199 --> 02:00:33,199
...

1278
02:00:33,199 --> 02:00:35,199
...

1279
02:00:35,199 --> 02:00:37,569
...

1280
02:00:37,569 --> 02:00:39,569
...

1281
02:00:39,569 --> 02:00:41,569
...

1282
02:00:41,569 --> 02:00:43,869
...

1283
02:00:43,869 --> 02:00:45,869
...

1284
02:00:45,869 --> 02:00:49,779
...

1285
02:00:49,779 --> 02:00:51,779
...

1286
02:00:51,779 --> 02:00:54,529
...

1287
02:00:54,529 --> 02:01:00,479
I want to watch TV.

1288
02:01:00,479 --> 02:01:04,899
That sounds like a plan to me.

1289
02:01:04,899 --> 02:01:11,550
What's on TV today?

1290
02:01:11,550 --> 02:01:13,550
Journal on.

1291
02:01:13,550 --> 02:01:15,550
Residents of Dollhouse.

1292
02:01:15,550 --> 02:01:17,550
We have an emergency announcement.

1293
02:01:17,550 --> 02:01:19,550
There has been a gorilla reported on the loose.

1294
02:01:19,550 --> 02:01:21,550
After speaking with the gorilla,

1295
02:01:21,550 --> 02:01:23,550
we did get some information about the motive

1296
02:01:23,550 --> 02:01:25,550
of his escape.

1297
02:01:25,550 --> 02:01:27,550
After dispute with his mother about not liking

1298
02:01:27,550 --> 02:01:29,550
his girlfriend,

1299
02:01:29,550 --> 02:01:31,550
he has decided to escape

1300
02:01:31,550 --> 02:01:33,550
his enclosure.

1301
02:01:33,550 --> 02:01:35,550
Here we have Randy, our specialist in the area

1302
02:01:35,550 --> 02:01:37,550
on gorillas and bears.

1303
02:01:37,550 --> 02:01:39,550
Randy, do you have any advice to offer citizens

1304
02:01:39,550 --> 02:01:41,550
if they encounter this gorilla?

1305
02:01:41,550 --> 02:01:43,550
The first thing you have to remember is you're dealing

1306
02:01:43,550 --> 02:01:45,550
with a wild animal.

1307
02:01:45,550 --> 02:01:47,550
It's dealing with heartache.

1308
02:01:47,550 --> 02:01:49,550
The first thing you need to do is make sure that if you

1309
02:01:49,550 --> 02:01:51,550
are going to approach these animals,

1310
02:01:51,550 --> 02:01:53,550
make sure you take somebody slower than you

1311
02:01:53,550 --> 02:01:55,550
because you want to be able to outrun them

1312
02:01:55,550 --> 02:01:57,550
in case you get attacked by that animal.

1313
02:01:57,550 --> 02:01:59,550
Second of all,

1314
02:01:59,550 --> 02:02:01,550
don't forget to play dead

1315
02:02:01,550 --> 02:02:03,550
because then you'll know what it's like when they kill you.

1316
02:02:03,550 --> 02:02:05,550
I would advise against

1317
02:02:05,550 --> 02:02:07,550
pepper spray.

1318
02:02:07,550 --> 02:02:09,550
Bears love the taste of pepper on human flesh.

1319
02:02:09,550 --> 02:02:11,550
I would suggest rubbing your body

1320
02:02:11,550 --> 02:02:13,550
with steamed broccoli before going out

1321
02:02:13,550 --> 02:02:15,550
after these animals.

1322
02:02:15,550 --> 02:02:17,550
Wonderful. Thank you so much, Randy.

1323
02:02:17,550 --> 02:02:19,550
Is there anything else you would like to say?

1324
02:02:19,550 --> 02:02:21,550
Did you get any more information behind the motive

1325
02:02:21,550 --> 02:02:23,550
from this gorilla?

1326
02:02:23,550 --> 02:02:25,550
No, really. Just the whole conversation was

1327
02:02:25,550 --> 02:02:27,550
it was just bananas, really.

1328
02:02:27,550 --> 02:02:29,550
It's just crazy. I'm not quite sure

1329
02:02:29,550 --> 02:02:31,550
what we're going to do.

1330
02:02:31,550 --> 02:02:33,550
That was fantastic. That was a great segue.

1331
02:02:33,550 --> 02:02:37,329
TV has been turned off.

1332
02:02:37,329 --> 02:02:39,329
A gorilla on the loose.

1333
02:02:39,329 --> 02:02:43,489
I don't have broccoli.

1334
02:02:43,489 --> 02:02:45,489
I don't have whatever else it was.

1335
02:02:45,489 --> 02:03:06,289
Really?

1336
02:03:06,289 --> 02:03:09,229
Right after the segment

1337
02:03:09,229 --> 02:03:14,670
on television?

1338
02:03:14,670 --> 02:03:16,670
I want to move. I want to move.

1339
02:03:16,670 --> 02:03:18,670
I don't want to live here anymore.

1340
02:03:18,670 --> 02:03:20,670
Why does it feel like everything is coming to get me?

1341
02:03:20,670 --> 02:03:22,670
And there are my glasses.

1342
02:03:22,670 --> 02:03:24,670
That was loud.

1343
02:03:24,670 --> 02:03:26,670
There's my glasses.

1344
02:03:26,670 --> 02:03:28,670
Everybody's trying to kill me in this town.

1345
02:03:28,670 --> 02:03:31,170
How could you possibly

1346
02:03:31,170 --> 02:03:33,170
live here for more than a week?

1347
02:03:33,170 --> 02:03:36,739
What the fuck?

1348
02:03:36,739 --> 02:03:38,739
I'm not going out there.

1349
02:03:38,739 --> 02:03:40,739
You saw what happened last time.

1350
02:03:40,739 --> 02:03:42,739
I'm not going out there again to get attacked.

1351
02:03:42,739 --> 02:03:49,250
I'm going to call a bear.

1352
02:03:49,250 --> 02:03:51,250
Call a bear?

1353
02:03:51,250 --> 02:03:53,250
What does that even mean, call bear?

1354
02:03:53,250 --> 02:03:55,250
Call bear?

1355
02:03:55,250 --> 02:03:57,250
I don't have a bear's phone number, do I?

1356
02:03:57,250 --> 02:03:59,250
I guess I do. My hand is doing it.

1357
02:03:59,250 --> 02:04:02,899
Hello?

1358
02:04:02,899 --> 02:04:05,710
I'd like to call

1359
02:04:05,710 --> 02:04:07,710
a bear service to come attack.

1360
02:04:07,710 --> 02:04:09,710
So help me, I guess.

1361
02:04:09,710 --> 02:04:12,140
This is a real service?

1362
02:04:12,140 --> 02:04:14,449
Okay, thank you.

1363
02:04:14,449 --> 02:04:16,449
How much does it cost?

1364
02:04:16,449 --> 02:04:18,449
That's too much money, but

1365
02:04:18,449 --> 02:04:20,449
Alright, god damn it.

1366
02:04:20,449 --> 02:04:26,079
Send him, send him in!

1367
02:04:26,079 --> 02:04:31,329
What the fuck?

1368
02:04:31,329 --> 02:04:34,979
It's a gorilla in my yard!

1369
02:04:34,979 --> 02:04:36,979
It's a gorilla in my... shit.

1370
02:04:36,979 --> 02:04:54,560
Did somebody just say

1371
02:04:54,560 --> 02:05:05,760
red rum?

1372
02:05:05,760 --> 02:05:14,340
Are we alright?

1373
02:05:14,340 --> 02:05:18,880
Oh, that's quite a mess out here.

1374
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:21,250
Nobody here, okay.

1375
02:05:21,250 --> 02:05:23,250
How much does that cost?

1376
02:05:23,250 --> 02:05:25,250
A bear service?

1377
02:05:25,250 --> 02:05:27,250
That was the bear that was here before, but he was friendly this time.

1378
02:05:27,250 --> 02:05:29,859
What does that cost?

1379
02:05:29,859 --> 02:05:31,859
The maid's going to have to...

1380
02:05:31,859 --> 02:05:33,859
Amelia, I'm still paying for your service.

1381
02:05:33,859 --> 02:05:35,859
It doesn't mean you don't come anymore.

1382
02:05:35,859 --> 02:05:42,050
$250

1383
02:05:42,050 --> 02:05:44,050
for a bear?

1384
02:05:44,050 --> 02:05:49,170
Was it $2,500 or $250?

1385
02:05:49,170 --> 02:05:52,109
I was going to say

1386
02:05:52,109 --> 02:05:54,289
that's pretty cheap if it was $2,500.

1387
02:05:54,289 --> 02:05:56,979
Good thing it was an extra zero.

1388
02:05:56,979 --> 02:06:00,670
Get this back over here.

1389
02:06:00,670 --> 02:06:07,010
Where it belongs, please.

1390
02:06:07,010 --> 02:06:09,010
It sucks.

1391
02:06:09,010 --> 02:06:16,239
This actually sucks.

1392
02:06:16,239 --> 02:06:25,949
It sucks living here.

1393
02:06:25,949 --> 02:06:30,619
I fucking hate living here.

1394
02:06:30,619 --> 02:06:37,140
I actually don't like being here.

1395
02:06:37,140 --> 02:06:39,140
I mean, it's a nice house, but

1396
02:06:39,140 --> 02:06:41,140
what is this neighborhood?

1397
02:06:41,140 --> 02:06:43,140
Bears, gorillas,

1398
02:06:43,140 --> 02:06:45,140
people that aren't drugs just attacking you.

1399
02:06:45,140 --> 02:06:49,300
We're like church groups that come into your house

1400
02:06:49,300 --> 02:06:51,300
and just don't even knock.

1401
02:06:51,300 --> 02:06:53,729
I don't know.

1402
02:06:53,729 --> 02:06:55,729
The police just sit on your couch and drink sodas and stuff.

1403
02:06:55,729 --> 02:06:57,729
People drink beer out of my fridge.

1404
02:06:57,729 --> 02:06:59,729
Mess.

1405
02:06:59,729 --> 02:07:12,510
Not today, not today.

1406
02:07:12,510 --> 02:07:14,510
Tomorrow.

1407
02:07:14,510 --> 02:07:27,500
Tomorrow, but tomorrow.

1408
02:07:27,500 --> 02:07:29,739
Why can't you just do tomorrow?

1409
02:07:29,739 --> 02:07:34,609
Showed up like this.

1410
02:07:34,609 --> 02:07:36,609
People aren't going to be happy about it.

1411
02:07:36,609 --> 02:07:39,170
Hello.

1412
02:07:39,170 --> 02:07:42,539
I'm going to work.

1413
02:07:42,539 --> 02:07:45,420
Fine.

1414
02:07:45,420 --> 02:07:47,920
Just wait, I'm coming.

1415
02:07:47,920 --> 02:07:50,930
That looks like a full car today.

1416
02:07:50,930 --> 02:07:52,930
Do I have to sit in the middle?

1417
02:07:52,930 --> 02:07:54,930
No, I don't want to sit in the middle.

1418
02:07:54,930 --> 02:07:56,930
Fine, just move.

1419
02:07:56,930 --> 02:12:57,390
That was a long day.

1420
02:12:57,390 --> 02:12:59,390
I sit in the middle because I'm the smallest one.

1421
02:12:59,390 --> 02:13:01,390
I know I always put it up for grabs

1422
02:13:01,390 --> 02:13:03,390
and I always say I'll do it, but that doesn't mean I want to.

1423
02:13:03,390 --> 02:13:05,390
Maybe next time I can get in the front

1424
02:13:05,390 --> 02:13:07,390
just once.

1425
02:13:07,390 --> 02:13:09,390
Just one time I sit in the front seat.

1426
02:13:09,390 --> 02:13:12,020
Sitting in the middle sucks.

1427
02:13:12,020 --> 02:13:14,020
I know I'm like the smallest guy,

1428
02:13:14,020 --> 02:13:16,020
but whatever, whatever works.

1429
02:13:16,020 --> 02:13:18,260
Thank you. See you on Saturday.

1430
02:13:18,260 --> 02:13:20,260
If you get a fucking invite.

1431
02:13:24,939 --> 02:13:26,939
Was that like a fun beep or was that like a you're mad beep?

1432
02:13:26,939 --> 02:13:28,939
I can't tell. You do that all the time.

1433
02:13:28,939 --> 02:13:31,699
You do that like every day.

1434
02:13:35,699 --> 02:13:37,699
I don't know if that's like you're making me look like an idiot.

1435
02:13:41,470 --> 02:13:43,470
Hi Edna, how are you?

1436
02:13:43,470 --> 02:13:45,470
Good day to you.

1437
02:13:45,470 --> 02:13:47,470
I'm doing well.

1438
02:13:47,470 --> 02:13:49,470
Treating you well?

1439
02:13:49,470 --> 02:13:51,470
Good, sweetheart. It's a strange world out there.

1440
02:13:53,470 --> 02:13:55,779
Okay. See you later.

1441
02:13:55,779 --> 02:13:59,789
Okay.

1442
02:13:59,789 --> 02:14:02,609
A lot of people in this neighborhood.

1443
02:14:02,609 --> 02:14:06,699
I gotta take this off.

1444
02:14:06,699 --> 02:14:08,699
I'm gonna get more comfortable.

1445
02:14:08,699 --> 02:14:10,699
My brain, my brain.

1446
02:14:10,699 --> 02:14:12,699
I need to probably play a quickie keyboard.

1447
02:14:14,699 --> 02:14:16,699
Did that cost money?

1448
02:14:16,699 --> 02:14:23,789
The maid has not been here.

1449
02:14:23,789 --> 02:14:28,659
I don't know where the maid has been.

1450
02:14:28,659 --> 02:14:31,279
But look, I know we had like an issue,

1451
02:14:31,279 --> 02:14:33,279
but you're still a maid.

1452
02:14:33,279 --> 02:14:35,279
I pay for a service.

1453
02:14:35,279 --> 02:14:47,819
Was the maid here?

1454
02:14:47,819 --> 02:14:51,789
Was the maid in the house?

1455
02:14:51,789 --> 02:14:53,789
Did Amelia take these?

1456
02:14:53,789 --> 02:14:56,029
That's Uncle Ted's stuff.

1457
02:14:56,029 --> 02:14:59,739
Oh, okay. So you were here.

1458
02:14:59,739 --> 02:15:01,739
Oh, I get it. I get it.

1459
02:15:01,739 --> 02:15:03,739
Oh, I'm mad.

1460
02:15:03,739 --> 02:15:05,739
Because you woohooed with death.

1461
02:15:07,739 --> 02:15:09,739
So I'm gonna take Ted's prize possession.

1462
02:15:09,739 --> 02:15:11,739
Okay.

1463
02:15:11,739 --> 02:15:13,739
Real funny.

1464
02:15:13,739 --> 02:15:15,739
Real funny.

1465
02:15:15,739 --> 02:15:17,739
We'll see if you come back again.

1466
02:15:17,739 --> 02:15:19,739
I'll get you right in the eye.

1467
02:15:19,739 --> 02:15:21,739
I'll look you right in the eye.

1468
02:15:21,739 --> 02:15:24,500
I'll tell you, get out of here and you're fired.

1469
02:15:24,500 --> 02:15:26,500
Unbelievable.

1470
02:15:26,500 --> 02:15:28,500
Unbelievable.

1471
02:15:28,500 --> 02:15:30,500
That's money.

1472
02:15:30,500 --> 02:15:36,369
I pay for a service regardless of if we have a problem.

1473
02:15:36,369 --> 02:15:38,369
It's unbelievable.

1474
02:15:38,369 --> 02:15:40,369
Take things from my goddamn house.

1475
02:15:40,369 --> 02:15:43,760
Because what? Because we had a problem?

1476
02:15:43,760 --> 02:15:45,760
We weren't even like, hold on.

1477
02:15:45,760 --> 02:15:49,149
Here's the worst part about this.

1478
02:15:49,149 --> 02:15:51,149
We weren't doing anything.

1479
02:15:51,149 --> 02:15:53,149
We had a date that was planned.

1480
02:15:53,149 --> 02:15:57,380
One date planned.

1481
02:15:57,380 --> 02:16:00,579
Can I dust my fingerprints?

1482
02:16:00,579 --> 02:16:02,579
Hold on a second.

1483
02:16:02,579 --> 02:16:04,579
We had one date planned.

1484
02:16:04,579 --> 02:16:10,829
I have to pee bad.

1485
02:16:10,829 --> 02:16:13,010
I'm starving.

1486
02:16:13,010 --> 02:16:28,939
And I'm tired.

1487
02:16:28,939 --> 02:16:30,939
This felt right today like this.

1488
02:16:30,939 --> 02:16:45,709
Looks good.

1489
02:16:45,709 --> 02:16:47,709
I'm hungry too.

1490
02:16:47,709 --> 02:16:49,709
Flush, don't just not flush. Come on, what is this?

1491
02:16:49,709 --> 02:16:55,149
I still have to record the apology video.

1492
02:16:55,149 --> 02:16:57,149
For the apology video, for the apology video, for the apology video.

1493
02:16:57,149 --> 02:16:59,149
For the apology.

1494
02:16:59,149 --> 02:17:06,450
Wait, hold on. Did you take anything else?

1495
02:17:06,450 --> 02:17:17,969
You took Ted's spoons.

1496
02:17:17,969 --> 02:17:19,969
Did you take Ted's furniture too?

1497
02:17:19,969 --> 02:17:24,750
I'm hungry.

1498
02:17:24,750 --> 02:17:28,209
Nothing missing from this room?

1499
02:17:28,209 --> 02:17:31,659
Emilia, give me a break.

1500
02:17:31,659 --> 02:17:33,659
Give me a break.

1501
02:17:33,659 --> 02:17:43,569
Alright, let's make some food.

1502
02:17:43,569 --> 02:17:46,260
Hopefully I feel a little bit better.

1503
02:17:46,260 --> 02:17:51,309
Oh, what?

1504
02:17:51,309 --> 02:17:53,309
Oh my god, a coffee maker.

1505
02:17:53,309 --> 02:17:55,309
I didn't even see this.

1506
02:17:55,309 --> 02:17:57,549
Oh my god, I love coffee.

1507
02:17:57,549 --> 02:17:59,549
That's perfect in the mornings. That's perfect.

1508
02:17:59,549 --> 02:18:03,969
Thank you.

1509
02:18:03,969 --> 02:18:12,799
It's a little dirty in there.

1510
02:18:12,799 --> 02:18:17,139
It's a little dirty.

1511
02:18:17,139 --> 02:18:20,340
That was extra dirty.

1512
02:18:20,340 --> 02:18:22,700
Oh, coffee!

1513
02:18:22,700 --> 02:18:24,700
Alright, food.

1514
02:18:24,700 --> 02:18:47,860
That's good.

1515
02:18:47,860 --> 02:18:50,799
That's a good baked, roasted

1516
02:18:50,799 --> 02:18:52,799
cooking.

1517
02:18:52,799 --> 02:18:58,110
Anything in here?

1518
02:18:58,110 --> 02:19:03,790
It's in here.

1519
02:19:03,790 --> 02:19:05,969
Why are there almonds in here?

1520
02:19:05,969 --> 02:19:08,659
Look at this.

1521
02:19:08,659 --> 02:19:12,049
There's a shitload of

1522
02:19:12,049 --> 02:19:19,219
pecans in here.

1523
02:19:19,219 --> 02:19:21,219
I'm tired.

1524
02:19:21,219 --> 02:19:23,219
I'm very tired and I'm not having a good

1525
02:19:23,219 --> 02:19:25,579
time at all.

1526
02:19:25,579 --> 02:19:27,579
Contrary to popular belief that we have laughing.

1527
02:19:27,579 --> 02:19:32,579
Make the bed.

1528
02:19:32,579 --> 02:19:34,879
I'll eat the rest of that cookie later.

1529
02:19:34,879 --> 02:19:37,250
I'll eat his cookies.

1530
02:19:37,250 --> 02:19:42,049
I'm like a six year old.

1531
02:19:42,049 --> 02:19:44,049
I want chicken tenders, french fries,

1532
02:19:44,049 --> 02:19:46,739
and cookies.

1533
02:19:46,739 --> 02:19:48,739
Can you even live off of pecan sandies?

1534
02:19:48,739 --> 02:19:50,739
Somebody look this up.

1535
02:19:50,739 --> 02:19:52,739
When do you die?

1536
02:19:52,739 --> 02:19:54,739
At what point after eating just pecan sandies?

1537
02:19:54,739 --> 02:19:58,129
I'm going to make my bed.

1538
02:19:58,129 --> 02:20:04,770
It's just like sugar,

1539
02:20:04,770 --> 02:20:06,770
bread, and like flour.

1540
02:20:06,770 --> 02:20:10,540
Can you live off of flour?

1541
02:20:10,540 --> 02:20:12,540
I think you can live off flour for at least a week.

1542
02:20:12,540 --> 02:20:15,729
I hope so.

1543
02:20:15,729 --> 02:20:25,139
Sorry, I take a multivitamin. You just don't see it.

1544
02:20:25,139 --> 02:20:28,340
You want one of these?

1545
02:20:28,340 --> 02:20:32,159
You want one of these?

1546
02:20:32,159 --> 02:20:36,129
Too bad they're sold out.

1547
02:20:36,129 --> 02:20:38,129
I actually think they are.

1548
02:20:38,129 --> 02:20:40,129
Germany985.com

1549
02:20:40,129 --> 02:20:45,870
Make the bed.

1550
02:20:45,870 --> 02:20:49,069
Hi.

1551
02:20:49,069 --> 02:20:51,069
We were just doing a little

1552
02:20:51,069 --> 02:20:53,069
work out.

1553
02:20:53,069 --> 02:20:55,069
You left your front door

1554
02:20:55,069 --> 02:20:57,069
unlocked.

1555
02:20:57,069 --> 02:20:59,069
I have a very important

1556
02:20:59,069 --> 02:21:01,069
quick question. Do you both

1557
02:21:01,069 --> 02:21:04,139
have a house?

1558
02:21:04,139 --> 02:21:06,139
I have a condo. It's my mom's condo.

1559
02:21:06,139 --> 02:21:08,139
It's just a temporary thing.

1560
02:21:08,139 --> 02:21:10,139
How much room is in the condo?

1561
02:21:10,139 --> 02:21:12,139
It's a one bedroom. Small.

1562
02:21:12,139 --> 02:21:14,139
About the size of a phone booth.

1563
02:21:14,139 --> 02:21:16,139
Do you have a house?

1564
02:21:16,139 --> 02:21:18,139
A condo?

1565
02:21:18,139 --> 02:21:20,139
Rental?

1566
02:21:20,139 --> 02:21:22,139
Gladys, I think it might be time.

1567
02:21:22,139 --> 02:21:24,139
I'm feeling a little overheated.

1568
02:21:24,139 --> 02:21:26,139
How long have you been in here?

1569
02:21:26,139 --> 02:21:28,139
I never really time my workouts.

1570
02:21:28,139 --> 02:21:30,139
When my body says it's done,

1571
02:21:30,139 --> 02:21:32,139
I know it's done.

1572
02:21:32,139 --> 02:21:34,139
But you have to do it in somebody's

1573
02:21:34,139 --> 02:21:36,139
bedroom in the neighborhood.

1574
02:21:36,139 --> 02:21:38,139
Wherever there's free space, we figured you're new to the

1575
02:21:38,139 --> 02:21:40,139
neighborhood.

1576
02:21:40,139 --> 02:21:42,139
Remember the 60 mile run?

1577
02:21:42,139 --> 02:21:44,139
I don't want you to leave.

1578
02:21:44,139 --> 02:21:46,139
I don't want you to leave.

1579
02:21:46,139 --> 02:21:48,139
In fact, I want you to

1580
02:21:48,139 --> 02:21:50,139
show me some workouts.

1581
02:21:50,139 --> 02:21:52,139
I would love to do some workouts.

1582
02:21:52,139 --> 02:21:54,139
Someone's had a change of attitude.

1583
02:21:54,139 --> 02:21:56,139
This is a nice shirt too.

1584
02:21:56,139 --> 02:21:58,139
Sweating.

1585
02:21:58,139 --> 02:22:00,139
You know why? Because the secret's in the sweat.

1586
02:22:00,139 --> 02:22:02,139
I think that is very sexy.

1587
02:22:02,139 --> 02:22:04,139
That is sexy

1588
02:22:04,139 --> 02:22:06,139
and awesome.

1589
02:22:06,139 --> 02:22:08,139
I'm very much into it.

1590
02:22:08,139 --> 02:22:10,139
It's a little forward.

1591
02:22:10,139 --> 02:22:12,139
I think you're wonderful.

1592
02:22:12,139 --> 02:22:14,139
Listen, someone's got a silver tongue.

1593
02:22:14,139 --> 02:22:16,139
Here's the first exercise.

1594
02:22:16,139 --> 02:22:18,139
Gladys, try to keep up this time.

1595
02:22:18,139 --> 02:22:20,139
Just perfect.

1596
02:22:20,139 --> 02:22:22,139
Hands up.

1597
02:22:22,139 --> 02:22:24,139
We've got spirit fingers.

1598
02:22:24,139 --> 02:22:26,139
I'm really tired.

1599
02:22:26,139 --> 02:22:28,139
Something light.

1600
02:22:28,139 --> 02:22:30,139
We're screwing in the light bulbs.

1601
02:22:30,139 --> 02:22:32,139
We're screwing in the light bulbs.

1602
02:22:32,139 --> 02:22:34,139
We're screwing in the light bulbs.

1603
02:22:34,139 --> 02:22:36,139
I find you very handsome and attractive.

1604
02:22:36,139 --> 02:22:38,139
That's not part of the workout.

1605
02:22:38,139 --> 02:22:40,139
That's just going to pretend

1606
02:22:40,139 --> 02:22:42,139
that didn't happen.

1607
02:22:42,139 --> 02:22:44,139
Now we're going to do the sprinkler.

1608
02:22:44,139 --> 02:22:46,139
Follow me.

1609
02:22:46,139 --> 02:22:48,139
I don't want to do the sprinkler.

1610
02:22:48,139 --> 02:22:50,139
Hey.

1611
02:22:50,139 --> 02:22:52,139
Hey.

1612
02:22:52,139 --> 02:22:54,139
I want to hear a better hey.

1613
02:22:54,139 --> 02:22:56,139
Hey.

1614
02:22:56,139 --> 02:22:58,139
That's a bit better.

1615
02:22:58,139 --> 02:23:00,139
I like that game Dark Souls.

1616
02:23:00,139 --> 02:23:02,139
Game Dark Souls.

1617
02:23:02,139 --> 02:23:04,139
We'll do it again.

1618
02:23:04,139 --> 02:23:06,139
Okay.

1619
02:23:06,139 --> 02:23:08,139
There's something stuck in the fax machine.

1620
02:23:08,139 --> 02:23:10,139
There's something stuck in the fax machine.

1621
02:23:10,139 --> 02:23:12,139
There's something stuck in the fax machine.

1622
02:23:12,139 --> 02:23:14,139
Oh, there's something stuck in the fax machine.

1623
02:23:14,139 --> 02:23:16,139
Get out of there.

1624
02:23:16,139 --> 02:23:18,139
There's something stuck in the fax machine.

1625
02:23:18,139 --> 02:23:20,139
There's something stuck in the fax machine.

1626
02:23:20,139 --> 02:23:22,139
There's something stuck in the fax machine.

1627
02:23:24,139 --> 02:23:26,139
You all right?

1628
02:23:26,139 --> 02:23:28,139
You going to be okay?

1629
02:23:28,139 --> 02:23:30,139
Screw you, Dad.

1630
02:23:30,139 --> 02:23:32,899
Hey.

1631
02:23:32,899 --> 02:23:34,899
You should look at the time.

1632
02:23:34,899 --> 02:23:36,899
I think it's bedtime.

1633
02:23:36,899 --> 02:23:38,899
I think it's time for me to go to bed right now.

1634
02:23:38,899 --> 02:23:45,229
Okay. Come on, Gladys.

1635
02:23:45,229 --> 02:31:11,170
Close that door, Gladys.

1636
02:31:11,170 --> 02:32:26,479
Oh.

1637
02:32:26,479 --> 02:32:28,479
I heard something

1638
02:32:28,479 --> 02:32:31,170
last night.

1639
02:32:31,170 --> 02:32:33,170
Oh, that was a very weird dream.

1640
02:32:33,170 --> 02:32:37,780
Oh.

1641
02:32:37,780 --> 02:32:40,719
It's Otto.

1642
02:32:40,719 --> 02:32:51,790
Wait, hold on.

1643
02:32:51,790 --> 02:32:53,790
There was an explosion

1644
02:32:53,790 --> 02:32:55,790
last night.

1645
02:32:55,790 --> 02:32:59,180
I don't know what it was.

1646
02:32:59,180 --> 02:33:05,899
I mean,

1647
02:33:05,899 --> 02:33:08,270
something just followed me

1648
02:33:08,270 --> 02:33:11,090
through here.

1649
02:33:11,090 --> 02:33:16,530
It smelled.

1650
02:33:16,530 --> 02:33:22,540
What was that? Is it a gas line?

1651
02:33:22,540 --> 02:33:27,659
Holy shit.

1652
02:33:27,659 --> 02:33:31,760
That's not me, is it?

1653
02:33:31,760 --> 02:33:39,379
Oh, my God. I think it is.

1654
02:33:39,379 --> 02:33:43,340
You want one of these?

1655
02:33:43,340 --> 02:33:46,219
What is this?

1656
02:33:46,219 --> 02:33:57,680
Oh, cabinets.

1657
02:33:57,680 --> 02:34:00,989
Stools in here.

1658
02:34:00,989 --> 02:34:02,989
And I'm not going to show this

1659
02:34:02,989 --> 02:34:05,940
what they're going to do.

1660
02:34:05,940 --> 02:34:07,940
I'm not going to show it because I know the audio guy.

1661
02:34:07,940 --> 02:34:10,180
I know what they're going to do.

1662
02:34:10,180 --> 02:34:12,180
In fact, audio guy,

1663
02:34:12,180 --> 02:34:14,180
I don't want you to play the sound that you want to play.

1664
02:34:14,180 --> 02:34:23,780
Play something else.

1665
02:34:23,780 --> 02:34:29,090
Oh, there's a poop emoji

1666
02:34:29,090 --> 02:34:31,090
in there. Okay.

1667
02:34:31,090 --> 02:34:34,930
What else is in here?

1668
02:34:34,930 --> 02:34:39,540
These are so heavy.

1669
02:34:39,540 --> 02:34:44,829
Oh,

1670
02:34:44,829 --> 02:34:46,829
the stool.

1671
02:34:46,829 --> 02:34:48,829
Wow. We had a lot of these.

1672
02:34:48,829 --> 02:34:52,479
And a smiley balloon.

1673
02:34:52,479 --> 02:34:57,969
I kind of don't...

1674
02:34:57,969 --> 02:34:59,969
Oh, that's sad.

1675
02:34:59,969 --> 02:35:01,969
That's really sad.

1676
02:35:01,969 --> 02:35:05,620
Nice cabinets.

1677
02:35:05,620 --> 02:35:07,790
What a waste of money.

1678
02:35:07,790 --> 02:35:09,790
You could have bought literally anything else.

1679
02:35:09,790 --> 02:35:13,500
What am I doing?

1680
02:35:13,500 --> 02:35:20,270
Decorate?

1681
02:35:20,270 --> 02:35:22,829
Decorate this room?

1682
02:35:22,829 --> 02:35:27,760
Let me first of all do this.

1683
02:35:27,760 --> 02:35:31,540
Remember, German985.com

1684
02:35:31,540 --> 02:35:33,540
if you want some merchandise from this stream.

1685
02:35:33,540 --> 02:35:35,540
It's all sold out, but who cares?

1686
02:35:35,540 --> 02:35:48,590
Let's see if I can get this open.

1687
02:35:48,590 --> 02:35:51,709
Decorate?

1688
02:35:51,709 --> 02:35:53,709
It's probably actually a pretty good time to do this room.

1689
02:35:53,709 --> 02:35:55,709
I think so.

1690
02:35:55,709 --> 02:35:58,209
We'll do this.

1691
02:35:58,209 --> 02:36:02,750
I don't like this being open.

1692
02:36:02,750 --> 02:36:04,750
I don't like that.

1693
02:36:04,750 --> 02:36:06,750
I don't like that one.

1694
02:36:06,750 --> 02:36:09,700
I like this one. I like that being open.

1695
02:36:09,700 --> 02:36:13,899
I want it open.

1696
02:36:13,899 --> 02:36:18,829
This fell. Get this out of the way.

1697
02:36:18,829 --> 02:36:21,760
This is the DIY room.

1698
02:36:21,760 --> 02:36:24,899
And if you don't know what a DIY room is,

1699
02:36:24,899 --> 02:36:26,899
it's do it yourself.

1700
02:36:26,899 --> 02:36:29,139
So we're going to be

1701
02:36:29,139 --> 02:36:31,139
you and I, of course.

1702
02:36:31,139 --> 02:36:33,139
We're going to be painting these rooms, maybe.

1703
02:36:33,139 --> 02:36:35,760
Pick a good color. I hope you do.

1704
02:36:35,760 --> 02:36:39,149
Hey, want to sit in crazy?

1705
02:36:39,149 --> 02:36:41,899
I command this to go into the bathroom!

1706
02:36:43,899 --> 02:36:50,500
Did it go into the bathroom?

1707
02:36:50,500 --> 02:36:53,760
It did.

1708
02:36:53,760 --> 02:36:58,239
I have magical powers!

1709
02:36:58,239 --> 02:37:01,170
Let's move this.

1710
02:37:01,170 --> 02:37:05,010
Get this out of the way.

1711
02:37:05,010 --> 02:37:07,010
This is so fucking heavy.

1712
02:37:07,010 --> 02:37:09,629
What a waste of fucking money.

1713
02:37:09,629 --> 02:37:16,850
Okay.

1714
02:37:16,850 --> 02:37:19,790
Okay.

1715
02:37:19,790 --> 02:37:21,790
That's not going to work.

1716
02:37:21,790 --> 02:37:27,170
That's not going to work.

1717
02:37:27,170 --> 02:37:29,170
Nothing else is going to...

1718
02:37:29,170 --> 02:37:31,170
What do you have back here for me?

1719
02:37:31,170 --> 02:37:33,170
What do you have?

1720
02:37:33,170 --> 02:37:35,469
What the fuck?

1721
02:37:35,469 --> 02:37:38,930
What?

1722
02:37:38,930 --> 02:37:40,930
I can't even move these.

1723
02:37:40,930 --> 02:37:45,790
They're like in ten pieces.

1724
02:37:45,790 --> 02:37:48,659
Okay.

1725
02:37:48,659 --> 02:37:52,430
I don't...

1726
02:37:52,430 --> 02:37:54,799
Get all this out of the way.

1727
02:37:54,799 --> 02:38:08,930
Out. Out.

1728
02:38:08,930 --> 02:38:15,200
Get this out of the way.

1729
02:38:15,200 --> 02:38:17,200
Open the door so I can see what I'm doing.

1730
02:38:17,200 --> 02:38:21,920
Good.

1731
02:38:21,920 --> 02:38:25,180
Alright, what do I want to do?

1732
02:38:25,180 --> 02:38:28,190
Number one thing I want to do in the DIY room.

1733
02:38:28,190 --> 02:38:31,069
I think we take out one of these walls.

1734
02:38:31,069 --> 02:38:33,069
Yep.

1735
02:38:33,069 --> 02:38:36,190
This is a sledgehammer.

1736
02:38:36,190 --> 02:38:38,190
What do we got here?

1737
02:38:38,190 --> 02:38:41,709
Alright, this is good.

1738
02:38:41,709 --> 02:38:43,709
This is a saw.

1739
02:38:43,709 --> 02:38:45,709
I'm thinking right here. I think so.

1740
02:38:45,709 --> 02:38:48,659
What do you think?

1741
02:38:48,659 --> 02:38:52,620
Oh, right there.

1742
02:38:52,620 --> 02:38:54,620
I want an open bedroom concept

1743
02:38:54,620 --> 02:38:56,620
for my VR room.

1744
02:38:56,620 --> 02:39:09,219
I can't really...

1745
02:39:09,219 --> 02:39:18,540
What happened?

1746
02:39:18,540 --> 02:39:21,620
Why does it not work?

1747
02:39:21,620 --> 02:39:24,620
It's plugged in. What the fuck?

1748
02:39:24,620 --> 02:39:33,569
The saw is not working anymore.

1749
02:39:33,569 --> 02:39:35,569
I think there's an electrical problem.

1750
02:39:35,569 --> 02:39:37,569
The saw doesn't work.

1751
02:39:37,569 --> 02:39:39,569
The saw doesn't work.

1752
02:39:39,569 --> 02:39:42,510
Oh, shit.

1753
02:39:42,510 --> 02:39:45,459
That scared the shit out of me.

1754
02:39:45,459 --> 02:39:47,459
I can't get the saw to work.

1755
02:39:47,459 --> 02:39:49,459
I'm trying to figure it out.

1756
02:39:49,459 --> 02:39:51,760
Let me see if I can get this to work somehow.

1757
02:39:54,639 --> 02:39:56,639
It would lead to the fuse box, probably.

1758
02:39:56,639 --> 02:40:03,809
That's probably what's going on.

1759
02:40:03,809 --> 02:40:06,180
Where does this go? This goes somewhere.

1760
02:40:06,180 --> 02:40:08,420
It's taped down over here, but...

1761
02:40:08,420 --> 02:40:12,370
Hold on.

1762
02:40:12,370 --> 02:40:14,370
Why would it stop working?

1763
02:40:14,370 --> 02:40:16,799
I plugged it into the base downstairs.

1764
02:40:16,799 --> 02:40:18,799
I have like a whole unit that's down there.

1765
02:40:18,799 --> 02:40:20,799
There's like four or five extension cords that go out.

1766
02:40:20,799 --> 02:40:24,180
I don't know. I don't get it.

1767
02:40:24,180 --> 02:40:26,739
What is going on?

1768
02:40:26,739 --> 02:40:33,840
What the heck is this?

1769
02:40:33,840 --> 02:40:35,840
Who are you?

1770
02:40:35,840 --> 02:40:38,590
I'm your neighbor. I'm Jeff.

1771
02:40:38,590 --> 02:40:40,590
I live next door.

1772
02:40:40,590 --> 02:40:42,590
What are you doing with my electricity?

1773
02:40:42,590 --> 02:40:44,590
I plugged this into my unit downstairs.

1774
02:40:44,590 --> 02:40:46,590
What are you talking about?

1775
02:40:46,590 --> 02:40:48,590
No way. That thing's coming straight from my house.

1776
02:40:48,590 --> 02:40:50,590
You can follow it down the street.

1777
02:40:50,590 --> 02:40:52,590
Listen, when I grew up, that's called thievery.

1778
02:40:52,590 --> 02:40:54,590
I don't know what you think that is.

1779
02:40:54,590 --> 02:40:56,590
I saw a place to plug it in. I plugged it in.

1780
02:40:56,590 --> 02:40:58,590
I didn't know if it was yours or not.

1781
02:40:58,590 --> 02:41:00,590
You didn't check first.

1782
02:41:00,590 --> 02:41:02,590
I can just use them.

1783
02:41:02,590 --> 02:41:04,590
What is this place?

1784
02:41:04,590 --> 02:41:06,590
This is your plug?

1785
02:41:06,590 --> 02:41:08,590
Yes, my plug.

1786
02:41:08,590 --> 02:41:10,590
Which are you? 980?

1787
02:41:10,590 --> 02:41:12,590
I live down past Edna.

1788
02:41:12,590 --> 02:41:14,590
You met Ludwig?

1789
02:41:14,590 --> 02:41:16,590
Yeah.

1790
02:41:16,590 --> 02:41:18,590
It's crazy how many people live here.

1791
02:41:18,590 --> 02:41:20,590
It's weird.

1792
02:41:20,590 --> 02:41:22,590
Dollhouse Lane.

1793
02:41:22,590 --> 02:41:24,590
Listen, I'm going to need that back.

1794
02:41:24,590 --> 02:41:26,590
I'm working on a project up here.

1795
02:41:26,590 --> 02:41:28,590
It looks like it.

1796
02:41:28,590 --> 02:41:30,590
What are you doing?

1797
02:41:30,590 --> 02:41:32,590
That is not the right tool for the job.

1798
02:41:32,590 --> 02:41:34,590
I've got to tell you that.

1799
02:41:34,590 --> 02:41:36,590
That's not the right tool for the job.

1800
02:41:36,590 --> 02:41:38,590
That's for sure.

1801
02:41:38,590 --> 02:41:40,590
This is more confusing than

1802
02:41:40,590 --> 02:41:42,590
a fart in a fan factory.

1803
02:41:42,590 --> 02:41:44,590
Excuse me, Jeb.

1804
02:41:48,590 --> 02:41:50,590
Is that your electricity?

1805
02:41:50,590 --> 02:41:52,590
Yeah, electricity.

1806
02:41:52,590 --> 02:41:54,590
I haven't been taking it from you, have I?

1807
02:41:54,590 --> 02:41:56,590
We'll have to see.

1808
02:41:56,590 --> 02:41:58,590
My bill has been exceptionally high.

1809
02:41:58,590 --> 02:42:00,590
How high has your bill been?

1810
02:42:00,590 --> 02:42:02,590
A couple extra hundred.

1811
02:42:02,590 --> 02:42:04,590
Listen, my son has been doing

1812
02:42:04,590 --> 02:42:06,590
some weird things on the computer.

1813
02:42:06,590 --> 02:42:08,590
I figured it was something like that.

1814
02:42:08,590 --> 02:42:10,590
You never know.

1815
02:42:12,590 --> 02:42:14,590
I'll tell you what.

1816
02:42:14,590 --> 02:42:16,590
Are you keeping these?

1817
02:42:16,590 --> 02:42:18,590
These appeared last night.

1818
02:42:18,590 --> 02:42:20,590
I don't even know where they're from.

1819
02:42:20,590 --> 02:42:22,590
I don't mind.

1820
02:42:22,590 --> 02:42:24,590
Maybe just to pay for the electricity,

1821
02:42:24,590 --> 02:42:26,590
my pleasure.

1822
02:42:26,590 --> 02:42:28,590
I don't actually owe you any money.

1823
02:42:28,590 --> 02:42:30,590
The electricity is mine.

1824
02:42:30,590 --> 02:42:32,590
That's the thing.

1825
02:42:32,590 --> 02:42:34,590
I tried to get this to work.

1826
02:42:34,590 --> 02:42:36,590
The saw doesn't work.

1827
02:42:36,590 --> 02:42:38,590
The saw doesn't work.

1828
02:42:38,590 --> 02:42:40,590
Basic safety.

1829
02:42:40,590 --> 02:42:42,590
Let me show you a couple things.

1830
02:42:42,590 --> 02:42:44,590
My daddy taught me this.

1831
02:42:44,590 --> 02:42:46,590
He taught me two things.

1832
02:42:46,590 --> 02:42:48,590
NASCAR and how to fix stuff.

1833
02:42:48,590 --> 02:42:50,590
You know this stuff?

1834
02:42:50,590 --> 02:42:52,590
Exactly.

1835
02:42:52,590 --> 02:42:54,590
What can you tell me?

1836
02:42:54,590 --> 02:42:56,590
What should we do in this room?

1837
02:42:56,590 --> 02:42:58,590
Are you a handy guy?

1838
02:42:58,590 --> 02:43:00,590
Oh, for sure.

1839
02:43:00,590 --> 02:43:02,590
I would start for sure.

1840
02:43:02,590 --> 02:43:04,590
You've got to get some paint up on the walls.

1841
02:43:04,590 --> 02:43:06,590
Probably move some stuff around.

1842
02:43:06,590 --> 02:43:08,590
It's pretty dirty.

1843
02:43:08,590 --> 02:43:10,590
Tripping hazard.

1844
02:43:10,590 --> 02:43:12,590
Do you know this guy?

1845
02:43:12,590 --> 02:43:14,590
I've never seen him before in my life.

1846
02:43:14,590 --> 02:43:16,590
No idea.

1847
02:43:16,590 --> 02:43:18,590
Let me see if I can see where this is.

1848
02:43:18,590 --> 02:43:20,590
Is that you?

1849
02:43:20,590 --> 02:43:22,590
Kiteboga?

1850
02:43:22,590 --> 02:43:24,590
I don't know if you've heard of those people.

1851
02:43:24,590 --> 02:43:26,590
German985.com.

1852
02:43:26,590 --> 02:43:28,590
It seems like you have

1853
02:43:28,590 --> 02:43:30,590
literally no idea what you're doing.

1854
02:43:30,590 --> 02:43:32,590
Do you think we should start with painting?

1855
02:43:32,590 --> 02:43:34,590
Is that what you think?

1856
02:43:34,590 --> 02:43:36,590
The first thing we're going to have to do

1857
02:43:36,590 --> 02:43:38,590
is paint, absolutely.

1858
02:43:38,590 --> 02:43:40,590
Have you dusted the walls yet?

1859
02:43:40,590 --> 02:43:42,590
I've pre-dusted.

1860
02:43:42,590 --> 02:43:44,590
Have you checked for prints?

1861
02:43:44,590 --> 02:43:46,590
Yes.

1862
02:43:46,590 --> 02:43:48,590
Do you build this house yourself or do you move in?

1863
02:43:48,590 --> 02:43:50,590
You never know if it's a crime scene or something.

1864
02:43:50,590 --> 02:43:52,590
I woke up one day and I had a sling on my arm.

1865
02:43:52,590 --> 02:43:54,590
I walked over here and this was just here.

1866
02:43:54,590 --> 02:43:56,590
I just figured it was mine.

1867
02:43:56,590 --> 02:43:58,590
A sling on your arm?

1868
02:43:58,590 --> 02:44:00,590
I had a broken arm and I went through a window

1869
02:44:00,590 --> 02:44:02,590
a few weeks ago.

1870
02:44:02,590 --> 02:44:04,590
You went through a window?

1871
02:44:04,590 --> 02:44:06,590
Were you here when the fire happened?

1872
02:44:06,590 --> 02:44:08,590
I heard some sirens.

1873
02:44:08,590 --> 02:44:10,590
I think I called the fire department.

1874
02:44:10,590 --> 02:44:12,590
Is that you?

1875
02:44:12,590 --> 02:44:14,590
Thank God for you because I shattered my arm

1876
02:44:14,590 --> 02:44:16,590
but I'm fine.

1877
02:44:16,590 --> 02:44:18,590
Let me show you something here.

1878
02:44:18,590 --> 02:44:20,590
You've got the stools.

1879
02:44:20,590 --> 02:44:22,590
How about pink?

1880
02:44:22,590 --> 02:44:24,590
Does pink work for you?

1881
02:44:24,590 --> 02:44:26,590
I don't think it'll look good

1882
02:44:26,590 --> 02:44:28,590
but if that's what you want.

1883
02:44:28,590 --> 02:44:30,590
What wall do you think I should do for pink?

1884
02:44:30,590 --> 02:44:32,590
What wall?

1885
02:44:32,590 --> 02:44:34,590
What are you even doing in here?

1886
02:44:34,590 --> 02:44:36,590
This is going to be my VR room.

1887
02:44:36,590 --> 02:44:38,590
I want to be able to jump around in virtual reality.

1888
02:44:38,590 --> 02:44:40,590
What on earth is that?

1889
02:44:40,590 --> 02:44:42,590
Virtual reality.

1890
02:44:42,590 --> 02:44:44,590
You're getting a headset now.

1891
02:44:44,590 --> 02:44:46,590
I swear you kids have no clue what's going on.

1892
02:44:46,590 --> 02:44:48,590
Virtual reality?

1893
02:44:48,590 --> 02:44:50,590
What is that?

1894
02:44:50,590 --> 02:44:52,590
I know you probably smelled gas coming up here.

1895
02:44:52,590 --> 02:44:54,590
Gas?

1896
02:44:54,590 --> 02:44:56,590
Gasoline? It's me.

1897
02:44:56,590 --> 02:44:58,590
I just want to make sure you're aware of that.

1898
02:44:58,590 --> 02:45:00,590
My smell ain't that great.

1899
02:45:00,590 --> 02:45:03,729
Gasoline.

1900
02:45:03,729 --> 02:45:05,729
You want to paint over all pink.

1901
02:45:05,729 --> 02:45:07,729
I want to paint pink.

1902
02:45:07,729 --> 02:45:09,729
For virtual reality.

1903
02:45:09,729 --> 02:45:11,729
I'm not quite sure what wall we're doing pink at the moment.

1904
02:45:11,729 --> 02:45:13,729
You got this wall here.

1905
02:45:13,729 --> 02:45:15,729
That's nice.

1906
02:45:15,729 --> 02:45:17,729
This pretty sturdy wall.

1907
02:45:17,729 --> 02:45:19,729
How about we do pink?

1908
02:45:19,729 --> 02:45:22,100
I need a tool to open this.

1909
02:45:22,100 --> 02:45:24,100
Have you tested these walls for stability?

1910
02:45:24,100 --> 02:45:26,100
Oh good lord.

1911
02:45:26,100 --> 02:45:29,420
I just like to do that.

1912
02:45:29,420 --> 02:45:31,420
Let me get this paint open.

1913
02:45:31,420 --> 02:45:33,420
You have no clue what you're doing.

1914
02:45:33,420 --> 02:45:35,420
Do you know how to open paint?

1915
02:45:35,420 --> 02:45:37,420
I've opened paint before.

1916
02:45:37,420 --> 02:45:39,420
I feel like it's a tuna can.

1917
02:45:39,420 --> 02:45:41,420
I've opened paint. I've opened tuna.

1918
02:45:41,420 --> 02:45:43,420
You live in the United States.

1919
02:45:43,420 --> 02:45:45,420
We had tuna sandwiches every day when we were kids.

1920
02:45:47,420 --> 02:45:49,420
You paint paint for virtual reality.

1921
02:45:49,420 --> 02:45:51,600
Why is that?

1922
02:45:51,600 --> 02:45:53,600
I just want to make sure I'm aware of this.

1923
02:45:53,600 --> 02:45:55,600
I would probably take off my shoes

1924
02:45:55,600 --> 02:45:57,600
if you don't want them to be covered in paint.

1925
02:45:59,600 --> 02:46:01,600
Let me get this straight.

1926
02:46:01,600 --> 02:46:03,600
You steal my electricity.

1927
02:46:03,600 --> 02:46:05,600
This is not stirred by the way.

1928
02:46:05,600 --> 02:46:07,600
How do I stir this?

1929
02:46:07,600 --> 02:46:09,600
Sit back and relax.

1930
02:46:09,600 --> 02:46:11,600
It's all intuitive.

1931
02:46:11,600 --> 02:46:13,600
You know what you're talking about.

1932
02:46:13,600 --> 02:46:15,600
I don't even know your name. Jeb?

1933
02:46:15,600 --> 02:46:18,989
Jeb.

1934
02:46:18,989 --> 02:46:20,989
Are you a painter?

1935
02:46:20,989 --> 02:46:22,989
Of course I am.

1936
02:46:22,989 --> 02:46:24,989
That looks pretty good.

1937
02:46:24,989 --> 02:46:26,989
You like that?

1938
02:46:26,989 --> 02:46:28,989
How long have you lived here for?

1939
02:46:28,989 --> 02:46:30,989
You can't even get on my floor!

1940
02:46:30,989 --> 02:46:32,989
I'm sorry about that.

1941
02:46:32,989 --> 02:46:34,989
I told you I know how to paint.

1942
02:46:34,989 --> 02:46:36,989
I didn't tell you I knew how to be cleanly.

1943
02:46:36,989 --> 02:46:38,989
Should we just dump it in here?

1944
02:46:38,989 --> 02:46:40,989
Yeah, I'd dump it.

1945
02:46:40,989 --> 02:46:42,989
Are you a handy person?

1946
02:46:42,989 --> 02:46:44,989
I got hands, yeah.

1947
02:46:44,989 --> 02:46:46,989
We'll make this work.

1948
02:46:46,989 --> 02:46:48,989
What wall are you putting it on?

1949
02:46:48,989 --> 02:46:50,989
The back wall.

1950
02:46:50,989 --> 02:46:52,989
East facing, north facing, south?

1951
02:46:52,989 --> 02:46:54,989
I don't know.

1952
02:46:54,989 --> 02:46:56,989
I don't have a compass.

1953
02:46:56,989 --> 02:46:58,989
It depends on where the moss grows.

1954
02:46:58,989 --> 02:47:00,989
You're a mess.

1955
02:47:00,989 --> 02:47:02,989
You're a waste.

1956
02:47:02,989 --> 02:47:04,989
Did you say a waste?

1957
02:47:04,989 --> 02:47:06,989
You're a big fat mistake.

1958
02:47:06,989 --> 02:47:08,989
I've never been more offended by someone

1959
02:47:08,989 --> 02:47:10,989
I've never met in my life.

1960
02:47:10,989 --> 02:47:12,989
I'm going for the back wall.

1961
02:47:12,989 --> 02:47:14,989
You're just going to paint now?

1962
02:47:14,989 --> 02:47:16,989
Yeah.

1963
02:47:16,989 --> 02:47:19,680
I have half a mind to leave right now.

1964
02:47:19,680 --> 02:47:21,680
He's painting your paint.

1965
02:47:21,680 --> 02:47:23,680
Do you think it looks good?

1966
02:47:23,680 --> 02:47:25,680
You've got to put more paint on.

1967
02:47:25,680 --> 02:47:27,680
Why don't you grab a brush and help me?

1968
02:47:27,680 --> 02:47:31,649
Why pink again?

1969
02:47:31,649 --> 02:47:33,649
Why pink?

1970
02:47:33,649 --> 02:47:35,649
Why are you doing pink?

1971
02:47:35,649 --> 02:47:37,649
Because the demons in my head told me to.

1972
02:47:37,649 --> 02:47:39,649
Okay, you're talking about Satan?

1973
02:47:39,649 --> 02:47:41,649
Well, it could be. I don't know.

1974
02:47:41,649 --> 02:47:43,649
I haven't figured it out yet.

1975
02:47:43,649 --> 02:47:45,649
You've got to do angled lines.

1976
02:47:45,649 --> 02:47:47,649
Do you go up and down or side to side?

1977
02:47:47,649 --> 02:47:49,649
You've got to go side to side or angles.

1978
02:47:49,649 --> 02:47:51,649
Better coverage.

1979
02:47:51,649 --> 02:47:53,649
I really do mean this.

1980
02:47:53,649 --> 02:47:55,649
This is not a joke.

1981
02:47:55,649 --> 02:47:57,649
This is not a joke for anything.

1982
02:47:57,649 --> 02:47:59,649
This is real life.

1983
02:47:59,649 --> 02:48:01,649
This is the first time I have ever

1984
02:48:01,649 --> 02:48:03,649
in my entire adult life,

1985
02:48:03,649 --> 02:48:05,649
in my entire childhood life

1986
02:48:05,649 --> 02:48:07,649
ever.

1987
02:48:07,649 --> 02:48:09,649
Congratulations, son.

1988
02:48:09,649 --> 02:48:14,260
There's a first time for everything.

1989
02:48:14,260 --> 02:48:16,260
We need to get on the ladder

1990
02:48:16,260 --> 02:48:18,260
to get the top of this, by the way.

1991
02:48:18,260 --> 02:48:20,260
Is that why you picked pink?

1992
02:48:20,260 --> 02:48:22,260
Because you've never painted before.

1993
02:48:22,260 --> 02:48:24,260
Or does it have something to do with virtual reality?

1994
02:48:24,260 --> 02:48:26,260
I just thought it was a cool color.

1995
02:48:26,260 --> 02:48:28,260
I thought it would look nice.

1996
02:48:28,260 --> 02:48:30,260
That looks pretty good.

1997
02:48:30,260 --> 02:48:32,260
You met my kids yet?

1998
02:48:32,260 --> 02:48:34,260
I smell.

1999
02:48:34,260 --> 02:48:36,260
It's making me gab.

2000
02:48:36,260 --> 02:48:38,260
I'm gabbing about it.

2001
02:48:38,260 --> 02:48:40,260
I smell so awful.

2002
02:48:40,260 --> 02:48:42,260
It smells like my bass boat.

2003
02:48:42,260 --> 02:48:44,260
I'm sorry. I really apologize that I smell this awful.

2004
02:48:44,260 --> 02:48:46,260
It's fine.

2005
02:48:46,260 --> 02:48:48,260
Look, it's the wood.

2006
02:48:48,260 --> 02:48:50,260
The wood emanates a disgusting onion and taco smell.

2007
02:48:50,260 --> 02:48:52,260
It definitely smells like something living.

2008
02:48:52,260 --> 02:48:54,260
It's coming from something living.

2009
02:48:54,260 --> 02:48:56,260
I'm really sorry about this.

2010
02:48:56,260 --> 02:48:58,260
I usually bathe at least once every day.

2011
02:48:58,260 --> 02:49:00,260
You live here alone, though?

2012
02:49:00,260 --> 02:49:02,260
Yeah.

2013
02:49:02,260 --> 02:49:04,260
I want to help you paint.

2014
02:49:04,260 --> 02:49:06,260
Eight days.

2015
02:49:06,260 --> 02:49:08,260
Is that right?

2016
02:49:08,260 --> 02:49:10,260
Yeah, I'm sorry. I have to tell you that.

2017
02:49:10,260 --> 02:49:12,260
That's okay. The pig's back in my yard.

2018
02:49:12,260 --> 02:49:14,260
Don't bathe either.

2019
02:49:14,260 --> 02:49:16,260
What are your piggies?

2020
02:49:16,260 --> 02:49:18,260
What the fuck would I say that to somebody in a public setting?

2021
02:49:18,260 --> 02:49:21,649
We still love them, though.

2022
02:49:21,649 --> 02:49:24,139
Is it what?

2023
02:49:24,139 --> 02:49:27,540
Is it pink or pank?

2024
02:49:27,540 --> 02:49:29,840
Is it pank or pink?

2025
02:49:29,840 --> 02:49:33,229
We're talking about pank balls.

2026
02:49:33,229 --> 02:49:36,559
You picked the color.

2027
02:49:36,559 --> 02:49:38,559
I was like, why are they saying that?

2028
02:49:38,559 --> 02:49:40,559
That's how we say it around here.

2029
02:49:40,559 --> 02:49:42,559
Pank balls.

2030
02:49:42,559 --> 02:49:44,559
Pank balls.

2031
02:49:44,559 --> 02:49:46,559
Excuse me, Jeb.

2032
02:49:46,559 --> 02:49:48,559
I appreciate the help.

2033
02:49:48,559 --> 02:49:50,559
I really do.

2034
02:49:50,559 --> 02:49:52,559
Thank you.

2035
02:49:52,559 --> 02:49:54,559
How do you say milk in these parts?

2036
02:49:54,559 --> 02:49:56,559
You know, if you're going to drink a glass of milk?

2037
02:49:56,559 --> 02:49:58,559
Say that again.

2038
02:49:58,559 --> 02:50:00,559
If you're going to drink a glass of milk,

2039
02:50:00,559 --> 02:50:02,559
what do you call it?

2040
02:50:02,559 --> 02:50:04,559
You know, Jeb,

2041
02:50:04,559 --> 02:50:06,559
I'm not really a big fan of the pink,

2042
02:50:06,559 --> 02:50:08,559
if I'm honest.

2043
02:50:08,559 --> 02:50:10,559
No?

2044
02:50:10,559 --> 02:50:12,559
I'm a pretty big fan of a black wall.

2045
02:50:12,559 --> 02:50:14,559
If you want to help me paint the wall black.

2046
02:50:14,559 --> 02:50:16,559
I've got a couple more minutes.

2047
02:50:16,559 --> 02:50:18,559
A couple more minutes.

2048
02:50:18,559 --> 02:50:20,559
I don't know what you're doing today or tomorrow,

2049
02:50:20,559 --> 02:50:22,559
but I really don't like the pink.

2050
02:50:22,559 --> 02:50:24,559
The pink doesn't pop for me.

2051
02:50:24,559 --> 02:50:26,559
I don't think my wife will miss me, if I'm honest.

2052
02:50:26,559 --> 02:50:28,559
Well, you live right at 980.

2053
02:50:28,559 --> 02:50:30,559
We need to paint this black.

2054
02:50:30,559 --> 02:50:32,559
It is getting kind of late, though.

2055
02:50:32,559 --> 02:50:34,559
We'll just be having it in a few minutes.

2056
02:50:34,559 --> 02:50:36,559
Is there food or nothing?

2057
02:50:36,559 --> 02:50:38,559
This food downstairs,

2058
02:50:38,559 --> 02:50:40,559
I know you came to my house completely uninvited.

2059
02:50:40,559 --> 02:50:42,559
Because you stole my electricity

2060
02:50:42,559 --> 02:50:44,559
just to throw it out there.

2061
02:50:44,559 --> 02:50:46,559
I didn't steal anything, actually.

2062
02:50:46,559 --> 02:50:48,559
I plugged my house

2063
02:50:48,559 --> 02:50:50,559
into an outlet that was on the street.

2064
02:50:50,559 --> 02:50:52,559
I thought it was a city outlet.

2065
02:50:52,559 --> 02:50:54,559
You thought it was a city outlet?

2066
02:50:54,559 --> 02:50:56,559
You pay taxes?

2067
02:50:56,559 --> 02:50:58,559
No, I haven't paid taxes in this city.

2068
02:50:58,559 --> 02:51:00,559
And you think the city is just going to give you electricity

2069
02:51:00,559 --> 02:51:02,559
for no reason?

2070
02:51:02,559 --> 02:51:04,559
Just pour right in there, okay?

2071
02:51:06,559 --> 02:51:08,559
That's where pink comes from.

2072
02:51:11,440 --> 02:51:13,440
Here, let me help you with that.

2073
02:51:13,440 --> 02:51:15,440
You do have a stench to you.

2074
02:51:15,440 --> 02:51:17,440
I'm sorry.

2075
02:51:17,440 --> 02:51:19,440
They won't let me take a shower for some reason.

2076
02:51:19,440 --> 02:51:21,440
Who's they? What are you talking about, they?

2077
02:51:21,440 --> 02:51:23,440
They're people that are here.

2078
02:51:23,440 --> 02:51:25,440
I know it's just you and me,

2079
02:51:25,440 --> 02:51:27,440
but there's like 60 fucking million people

2080
02:51:27,440 --> 02:51:29,440
that are watching and having me do something.

2081
02:51:29,440 --> 02:51:31,440
What are you talking about?

2082
02:51:31,440 --> 02:51:33,440
You mean like they're sending me in the walls?

2083
02:51:33,440 --> 02:51:35,440
Yeah.

2084
02:51:35,440 --> 02:51:37,440
I've been thinking there must be something to drink in the water as well.

2085
02:51:37,440 --> 02:51:39,440
I need to have another way to see what I'm doing.

2086
02:51:39,440 --> 02:51:41,440
You ever wake up at night

2087
02:51:41,440 --> 02:51:43,440
and just see random things,

2088
02:51:43,440 --> 02:51:45,440
like things flying in space, is that what you're referring to?

2089
02:51:45,440 --> 02:51:47,440
Yeah, Jeb.

2090
02:51:47,440 --> 02:51:49,440
What are you looking for?

2091
02:51:49,440 --> 02:51:51,440
I'm looking for screwdrivers.

2092
02:51:51,440 --> 02:51:53,440
There you go.

2093
02:51:53,440 --> 02:51:55,440
So you're saying you moved in.

2094
02:51:55,440 --> 02:51:57,440
I moved in.

2095
02:51:57,440 --> 02:51:59,440
Your house could be haunted, have you considered that?

2096
02:51:59,440 --> 02:52:01,440
Jeb, do you, like,

2097
02:52:01,440 --> 02:52:03,440
a very serious one-to-one, you and I.

2098
02:52:03,440 --> 02:52:05,440
Forget about anybody here.

2099
02:52:05,440 --> 02:52:07,440
There is literally no one here. It's a wall.

2100
02:52:07,440 --> 02:52:09,440
You don't even have a window right here.

2101
02:52:09,440 --> 02:52:11,440
One-to-wub, you and me, Jeb.

2102
02:52:11,440 --> 02:52:13,440
Are there,

2103
02:52:13,440 --> 02:52:15,440
is there like drug problems in this neighborhood?

2104
02:52:15,440 --> 02:52:17,440
Drug problems?

2105
02:52:17,440 --> 02:52:19,440
You're talking about like what kind of drugs in specific?

2106
02:52:19,440 --> 02:52:21,440
Like acetaminophen or

2107
02:52:21,440 --> 02:52:23,440
what are you talking about?

2108
02:52:23,440 --> 02:52:25,440
I don't know. I just feel like people are on crack

2109
02:52:25,440 --> 02:52:27,440
in this neighborhood.

2110
02:52:27,440 --> 02:52:29,440
Get that box out of the way, Jeb.

2111
02:52:29,440 --> 02:52:31,440
Yeah, sure. What's in here?

2112
02:52:31,440 --> 02:52:33,440
Why do you want me to move it?

2113
02:52:33,440 --> 02:52:35,440
Just kick it forward.

2114
02:52:35,440 --> 02:52:37,440
Just push it forward.

2115
02:52:37,440 --> 02:52:39,440
Yeah, just throw it off

2116
02:52:39,440 --> 02:52:41,440
into the bathroom.

2117
02:52:41,440 --> 02:52:43,440
Just push it over.

2118
02:52:43,440 --> 02:52:45,440
Just kick it. Doesn't matter.

2119
02:52:45,440 --> 02:52:48,770
There's a wall here, I don't understand.

2120
02:52:48,770 --> 02:52:50,770
Jeb, this is green!

2121
02:52:50,770 --> 02:52:52,770
This isn't even black!

2122
02:52:52,770 --> 02:52:54,770
This is green! This is green paint!

2123
02:52:54,770 --> 02:52:56,770
I told you you ain't good at this.

2124
02:52:56,770 --> 02:52:58,770
I really ain't good at this.

2125
02:52:58,770 --> 02:53:00,770
Jeb!

2126
02:53:00,770 --> 02:53:02,770
God damn it.

2127
02:53:02,770 --> 02:53:04,770
Is that black? Can you check?

2128
02:53:04,770 --> 02:53:06,770
We don't use words like that.

2129
02:53:06,770 --> 02:53:09,329
I'm sorry, Jeb.

2130
02:53:09,329 --> 02:53:11,329
Hold on.

2131
02:53:11,329 --> 02:53:13,329
You're really

2132
02:53:13,329 --> 02:53:15,329
going to take care of that stand

2133
02:53:15,329 --> 02:53:17,329
right now.

2134
02:53:17,329 --> 02:53:19,329
So you don't shower because people are

2135
02:53:19,329 --> 02:53:21,329
listening to you in your house.

2136
02:53:21,329 --> 02:53:23,329
I don't shower because they don't let me.

2137
02:53:23,329 --> 02:53:25,329
The ghosts tell you

2138
02:53:25,329 --> 02:53:27,329
not to take a shower.

2139
02:53:27,329 --> 02:53:29,329
You want to appease the ghosts

2140
02:53:29,329 --> 02:53:31,329
who think you're stinky.

2141
02:53:31,329 --> 02:53:33,329
Jeb, let me ask you another question.

2142
02:53:33,329 --> 02:53:35,329
Do you just wake up

2143
02:53:35,329 --> 02:53:37,329
with furniture in your house?

2144
02:53:37,329 --> 02:53:39,329
No, I pay for it because I have a job.

2145
02:53:39,329 --> 02:53:41,329
You ever thought about getting one of those?

2146
02:53:41,329 --> 02:53:43,329
Where do you think I got a house like this from?

2147
02:53:43,329 --> 02:53:45,329
Fair enough.

2148
02:53:45,329 --> 02:53:47,329
Excuse me.

2149
02:53:47,329 --> 02:53:49,329
I don't have any money.

2150
02:53:49,329 --> 02:53:51,329
I'm sorry, so you're saying

2151
02:53:51,329 --> 02:53:53,329
you want us to paint black over your

2152
02:53:53,329 --> 02:53:55,329
pink wall right there?

2153
02:53:55,329 --> 02:53:57,329
That's what I've been told from the

2154
02:53:57,329 --> 02:53:59,329
demons, Jeb.

2155
02:53:59,329 --> 02:54:01,329
I'll take care of it for you, alright?

2156
02:54:01,329 --> 02:54:03,329
Why don't you just clean up a little bit of your stain

2157
02:54:03,329 --> 02:54:05,329
or something? Just a tiny bit.

2158
02:54:05,329 --> 02:54:07,329
Can you guys please

2159
02:54:07,329 --> 02:54:09,329
do me a favor and just make it so we don't have to talk

2160
02:54:09,329 --> 02:54:11,329
about this every five seconds?

2161
02:54:11,329 --> 02:54:13,329
I'm filling the house with like human gas.

2162
02:54:13,329 --> 02:54:15,329
Like please just pick

2163
02:54:15,329 --> 02:54:17,700
shower.

2164
02:54:17,700 --> 02:54:19,700
We're painting the walls like pink and then black

2165
02:54:19,700 --> 02:54:21,700
and whatever. Please just pick it so he doesn't

2166
02:54:21,700 --> 02:54:23,700
trust it.

2167
02:54:23,700 --> 02:54:25,700
I told you I know how to do stuff in a house.

2168
02:54:25,700 --> 02:54:27,700
I'm not an interior designer.

2169
02:54:27,700 --> 02:54:29,700
What do you expect me to do here?

2170
02:54:29,700 --> 02:54:31,700
Black on the back wall.

2171
02:54:31,700 --> 02:54:33,700
Dip it in there?

2172
02:54:33,700 --> 02:54:35,700
Yes, just dip it in there black on the back wall.

2173
02:54:35,700 --> 02:54:37,700
My wife makes a mean turkey casserole.

2174
02:54:37,700 --> 02:54:39,700
She just takes mayonnaise and pretty much that's it.

2175
02:54:42,379 --> 02:54:44,379
That's it?

2176
02:54:44,379 --> 02:54:46,379
You just ruined the floor.

2177
02:54:46,379 --> 02:54:48,379
This is a very

2178
02:54:48,379 --> 02:54:50,379
significantly watered down

2179
02:54:50,379 --> 02:54:52,379
version of blank paint. I hope you understand.

2180
02:54:52,379 --> 02:54:54,379
I just want to get curious. I just want to make sure

2181
02:54:54,379 --> 02:54:56,379
I caught that correctly.

2182
02:54:56,379 --> 02:54:58,379
Turkey casserole, what's in it?

2183
02:54:58,379 --> 02:55:00,379
Listen, we're a big fan. You can make a casserole

2184
02:55:00,379 --> 02:55:02,379
out of anything.

2185
02:55:02,379 --> 02:55:04,559
A casserole out of anything with mayonnaise?

2186
02:55:04,559 --> 02:55:06,559
I just didn't wait

2187
02:55:06,559 --> 02:55:08,559
for it.

2188
02:55:11,819 --> 02:55:14,379
I think you made a new paint.

2189
02:55:16,379 --> 02:55:18,379
Listen, this is easy.

2190
02:55:18,379 --> 02:55:21,329
We'll just run back and forth.

2191
02:55:21,329 --> 02:55:23,329
Well, don't come over on my domain.

2192
02:55:23,329 --> 02:55:25,329
It is kind of fun though.

2193
02:55:25,329 --> 02:55:27,329
Do you want the ladder? We need to get up there too.

2194
02:55:27,329 --> 02:55:29,329
I mean, it's not bad.

2195
02:55:29,329 --> 02:55:31,329
Look, you can even draw on it. What's your name again?

2196
02:55:31,329 --> 02:55:33,329
My name is Jeffrey.

2197
02:55:33,329 --> 02:55:35,329
Jeffrey

2198
02:55:35,329 --> 02:55:37,329
900.

2199
02:55:41,329 --> 02:55:43,329
Thank God.

2200
02:55:43,329 --> 02:55:45,329
Good luck.

2201
02:55:45,329 --> 02:55:47,329
Just keep doing what you're doing.

2202
02:55:47,329 --> 02:55:49,329
I just have to shower.

2203
02:55:49,329 --> 02:55:51,329
Just do what you're doing.

2204
02:55:51,329 --> 02:55:56,190
This ain't my house.

2205
02:55:56,190 --> 02:55:59,250
Excuse me? Hello?

2206
02:55:59,250 --> 02:56:01,250
Are you coming back or

2207
02:56:01,250 --> 02:56:03,250
are you going to get like pizza or something or

2208
02:56:03,250 --> 02:56:07,469
mayonnaise?

2209
02:56:07,469 --> 02:56:09,469
Okay.

2210
02:56:09,469 --> 02:56:11,469
That's the wrong door again.

2211
02:56:11,469 --> 02:56:31,040
That's the wrong door again.

2212
02:56:31,040 --> 02:56:38,399
Taking a shower.

2213
02:56:38,399 --> 02:56:41,469
Mary's coming around the turn back

2214
02:56:41,469 --> 02:56:43,709
out there.

2215
02:56:43,709 --> 02:56:46,459
Wow.

2216
02:56:46,459 --> 02:56:48,459
Wow.

2217
02:56:48,459 --> 02:56:50,459
Do I brush my teeth four times a day?

2218
02:56:50,459 --> 02:56:52,459
Wow.

2219
02:56:52,459 --> 02:56:54,459
We don't need the pit stop.

2220
02:56:54,459 --> 02:57:00,159
We're going to NASCAR.

2221
02:57:00,159 --> 02:57:02,159
We're going to NASCAR.

2222
02:57:02,159 --> 02:57:05,229
That's so much better.

2223
02:57:05,229 --> 02:57:07,229
Oh my God, I smell like a dirty

2224
02:57:07,229 --> 02:57:09,229
gas-covered honey in my mouth.

2225
02:57:11,229 --> 02:57:13,229
I'm just embarrassing myself. People are

2226
02:57:13,229 --> 02:57:15,229
embarrassed to be in the same room with me.

2227
02:57:15,229 --> 02:57:17,229
People are embarrassed.

2228
02:57:17,229 --> 02:57:22,979
Okay, not bad.

2229
02:57:22,979 --> 02:57:40,000
Thank God.

2230
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:42,000
I still feel like I smell.

2231
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:44,000
You know when you take a shower, you feel like

2232
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:46,879
not showering for three days, and you still

2233
02:57:46,879 --> 02:57:49,120
smell your armpits.

2234
02:57:49,120 --> 02:57:51,120
God, I need to do that every single day.

2235
02:57:51,120 --> 02:57:53,120
Put me down by the river.

2236
02:57:53,120 --> 02:57:55,120
Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.

2237
02:57:55,120 --> 02:57:57,120
I NASCAR'd that sucker out there.

2238
02:57:57,120 --> 02:57:59,120
That looks great.

2239
02:57:59,120 --> 02:58:01,120
Thank you. Is that all you wanted?

2240
02:58:01,120 --> 02:58:03,120
This place don't look much better than when I got

2241
02:58:03,120 --> 02:58:05,120
here, I feel like.

2242
02:58:05,120 --> 02:58:07,120
That looks good. I kind of want to move this out of the way.

2243
02:58:07,120 --> 02:58:09,120
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.

2244
02:58:09,120 --> 02:58:11,120
I almost just spanked my ankle.

2245
02:58:11,120 --> 02:58:13,120
I'm fine. I don't know much about safety.

2246
02:58:13,120 --> 02:58:15,120
What do you think about this wall, Jeff?

2247
02:58:15,120 --> 02:58:17,120
I mean, it doesn't look good.

2248
02:58:17,120 --> 02:58:19,120
I want to get...

2249
02:58:19,120 --> 02:58:21,120
Before you came into the house,

2250
02:58:21,120 --> 02:58:23,120
I wanted to get rid of this wall.

2251
02:58:23,120 --> 02:58:25,120
Oh, you're talking about that wall right there.

2252
02:58:25,120 --> 02:58:27,120
I don't want to be caught in the VR.

2253
02:58:27,120 --> 02:58:29,120
Yeah, that's the northeast south-facing wall.

2254
02:58:29,120 --> 02:58:31,120
North-northeast south-facing.

2255
02:58:31,120 --> 02:58:33,940
I mean, you could probably get

2256
02:58:33,940 --> 02:58:35,940
rid of it pretty easy.

2257
02:58:35,940 --> 02:58:37,940
Hold on, Jeff. I'm just going to take care of something.

2258
02:58:37,940 --> 02:58:41,329
You don't want to paint it or nothing?

2259
02:58:41,329 --> 02:58:43,329
Just give me a second. I'm just going to cover this.

2260
02:58:43,329 --> 02:58:45,329
No, I want to get rid of it. It's a VR room.

2261
02:58:45,329 --> 02:58:47,329
Okay. You've got a lot of paint around here.

2262
02:58:50,209 --> 02:58:52,209
Jeff, I've got to go get my robe on.

2263
02:58:52,209 --> 02:58:54,209
Your robe?

2264
02:58:54,209 --> 02:58:56,209
Can you please bring me some sort of food?

2265
02:58:56,209 --> 02:58:58,209
I mean, I've been here for what, like three days?

2266
02:58:58,209 --> 02:59:00,209
I'm just kidding.

2267
02:59:00,209 --> 02:59:02,209
Do you like cookies? Three hours. Cookies?

2268
02:59:02,209 --> 02:59:04,209
Do you like cookies? Yeah, P.K. and Sandy's. What do you got?

2269
02:59:04,209 --> 02:59:06,209
I like cookies. Molasses cookies.

2270
02:59:06,209 --> 02:59:08,209
Chocolate chip cookies. Mayonnaise cookies.

2271
02:59:08,209 --> 02:59:10,209
I like every kind of cookie, by the way.

2272
02:59:10,209 --> 02:59:12,209
Put your robe on.

2273
02:59:12,209 --> 02:59:14,209
What am I, like a 1940s billionaire?

2274
02:59:14,209 --> 02:59:16,209
Like, what are you talking about?

2275
02:59:16,209 --> 02:59:18,209
Put your robe on.

2276
02:59:18,209 --> 02:59:20,209
Put your robe on. What are you talking about?

2277
02:59:20,209 --> 02:59:23,469
I don't even know where it is. Where is it?

2278
02:59:23,469 --> 02:59:25,469
Let me see what he's got around here.

2279
02:59:25,469 --> 02:59:27,469
Must have taken that wall down, huh?

2280
02:59:27,469 --> 02:59:29,469
I'm like a playboy.

2281
02:59:29,469 --> 02:59:31,469
I don't even know where my robe is.

2282
02:59:31,469 --> 02:59:34,290
All right.

2283
02:59:34,290 --> 02:59:36,290
Hard day's work. That's what I'm talking about.

2284
02:59:36,290 --> 02:59:38,290
Hard day's work. I don't know who the robe is.

2285
02:59:38,290 --> 02:59:40,459
All right.

2286
02:59:40,459 --> 02:59:48,590
Oh.

2287
02:59:48,590 --> 03:00:01,180
Where is my robe?

2288
03:00:01,180 --> 03:00:06,940
Excuse me, Jeb.

2289
03:00:06,940 --> 03:00:08,940
Yeah, yeah.

2290
03:00:08,940 --> 03:00:10,940
You say you want to take that wall out, huh?

2291
03:00:10,940 --> 03:00:12,940
Do I want to take it down?

2292
03:00:12,940 --> 03:00:14,940
You want me to get started on that?

2293
03:00:14,940 --> 03:00:16,940
Are you literally going to do anything?

2294
03:00:16,940 --> 03:00:18,940
There are safety glasses there, Jeb.

2295
03:00:18,940 --> 03:00:20,940
Safety glasses?

2296
03:00:20,940 --> 03:00:27,260
I want this down.

2297
03:00:27,260 --> 03:00:29,260
So let me get this straight. You have safety glasses in this house.

2298
03:00:29,260 --> 03:00:31,260
Yeah.

2299
03:00:31,260 --> 03:00:33,260
But demons keep you up at night,

2300
03:00:33,260 --> 03:00:35,260
making you not shot.

2301
03:00:35,260 --> 03:00:37,260
It's like you're prepared for certain things.

2302
03:00:37,260 --> 03:00:39,260
Yeah. It don't make no sense.

2303
03:00:39,260 --> 03:00:41,260
Do you want to help or do you want to go home?

2304
03:00:41,260 --> 03:00:43,260
Now listen, I don't think you have any clue what you're doing.

2305
03:00:43,260 --> 03:00:45,260
I don't.

2306
03:00:45,260 --> 03:00:47,260
You ever demolish something before?

2307
03:00:47,260 --> 03:00:49,260
Get these off.

2308
03:00:49,260 --> 03:00:51,260
No, never. Never?

2309
03:00:51,260 --> 03:00:53,260
I've done a thing or two in my life.

2310
03:00:53,260 --> 03:00:55,260
If I do VR...

2311
03:00:55,260 --> 03:00:57,260
I don't want to bump into the wall

2312
03:00:57,260 --> 03:00:59,260
and like, oh, I'm doing VR.

2313
03:00:59,260 --> 03:01:01,260
Oh, shit, I hit the wall.

2314
03:01:01,260 --> 03:01:03,260
I think it has to come down.

2315
03:01:03,260 --> 03:01:05,260
Let's see if I can get it down.

2316
03:01:05,260 --> 03:01:07,260
Thor's hammer over here.

2317
03:01:07,260 --> 03:01:09,260
You look kind of funny with your robe on.

2318
03:01:09,260 --> 03:01:11,260
I'm not going to lie.

2319
03:01:11,260 --> 03:01:14,719
Hey, you're for real. You're taking that wall down.

2320
03:01:14,719 --> 03:01:16,719
Yeah.

2321
03:01:16,719 --> 03:01:18,719
It's got to come down.

2322
03:01:18,719 --> 03:01:20,719
You ever thought about pretending like you're on the back nine?

2323
03:01:20,719 --> 03:01:22,719
Like a golf swing?

2324
03:01:22,719 --> 03:01:24,719
Let me get a little bit of power into it.

2325
03:01:24,719 --> 03:01:26,719
That's not quite what I meant.

2326
03:01:26,719 --> 03:01:28,899
That's not a golf swing, my friend.

2327
03:01:28,899 --> 03:01:30,899
That was a golf swing.

2328
03:01:30,899 --> 03:01:32,899
Let me show you.

2329
03:01:32,899 --> 03:01:36,159
Hold on, let me get one more.

2330
03:01:36,159 --> 03:01:38,159
I'm going to just step over here for a second.

2331
03:01:40,159 --> 03:01:42,719
I just bounced off.

2332
03:01:42,719 --> 03:01:44,719
Would you like to try again?

2333
03:01:44,719 --> 03:01:46,719
Let me show you how you do it.

2334
03:01:46,719 --> 03:01:48,719
I'm talking about pretending you're on the back nine.

2335
03:01:48,719 --> 03:01:50,719
And you don't want to get back home, okay?

2336
03:01:50,719 --> 03:01:52,719
You don't want to get back home because you got a lot going on.

2337
03:01:52,719 --> 03:01:54,719
Let me just light up my shower really quick.

2338
03:01:54,719 --> 03:01:56,719
Okay.

2339
03:01:56,719 --> 03:02:00,739
Are you a putter or are you a driver?

2340
03:02:00,739 --> 03:02:02,739
You got another hammer or no?

2341
03:02:02,739 --> 03:02:04,739
No, I'm just watching you do this.

2342
03:02:04,739 --> 03:02:07,809
Okay.

2343
03:02:07,809 --> 03:02:09,809
You see that?

2344
03:02:09,809 --> 03:02:11,809
That was actually really good for not very much effort.

2345
03:02:11,809 --> 03:02:13,809
And then you can just go back and forth.

2346
03:02:13,809 --> 03:02:16,110
That's very good.

2347
03:02:16,110 --> 03:02:18,110
Very easy.

2348
03:02:18,110 --> 03:02:20,110
Hey Jeff, let me see that for a second.

2349
03:02:20,110 --> 03:02:26,190
Let me show you something.

2350
03:02:26,190 --> 03:02:31,309
Hey Jeff, get along with it.

2351
03:02:31,309 --> 03:02:33,309
I may have just sold my pants.

2352
03:02:33,309 --> 03:02:35,309
Hey Jeff, you want a swing?

2353
03:02:35,309 --> 03:02:37,309
I may have just sold my pants.

2354
03:02:37,309 --> 03:02:39,309
It's going to be more than one person stinking up this place right now.

2355
03:02:39,309 --> 03:02:42,059
I'll tell you that.

2356
03:02:42,059 --> 03:02:44,059
Go for a swing, Jeff.

2357
03:02:44,059 --> 03:02:46,059
I mean, you won't take the whole wall down.

2358
03:02:46,059 --> 03:02:48,059
I want it down. I don't want it there.

2359
03:02:48,059 --> 03:02:53,760
Are you sure about that?

2360
03:02:53,760 --> 03:02:55,760
See? Good.

2361
03:02:55,760 --> 03:02:57,760
How many more swings?

2362
03:02:57,760 --> 03:02:59,760
I don't know.

2363
03:02:59,760 --> 03:03:01,760
I want to do all the work for you.

2364
03:03:01,760 --> 03:03:03,760
I don't want to do everything.

2365
03:03:03,760 --> 03:03:05,760
That's for you. That's your house.

2366
03:03:05,760 --> 03:03:07,760
You hit it right up there in the quadrant?

2367
03:03:07,760 --> 03:03:09,760
Jerma.

2368
03:03:09,760 --> 03:03:11,760
You give me like two seconds just to hide.

2369
03:03:11,760 --> 03:03:13,760
Jerma, you're short.

2370
03:03:13,760 --> 03:03:15,760
Jerma, you're like five-five. No, I'm not. Fuck you.

2371
03:03:15,760 --> 03:03:17,760
You're like five-six. I'm fucking five-seven.

2372
03:03:17,760 --> 03:03:19,760
Idiot. Shut up. Fucking idiots.

2373
03:03:19,760 --> 03:03:21,760
Are you talking to me?

2374
03:03:21,760 --> 03:03:30,319
Yeah.

2375
03:03:30,319 --> 03:03:32,319
You're really digging that wall down, aren't you?

2376
03:03:34,319 --> 03:03:37,520
You hit it up right there, I think.

2377
03:03:37,520 --> 03:03:39,950
Yeah.

2378
03:03:39,950 --> 03:03:41,950
That's right. That's what I'm talking about.

2379
03:03:41,950 --> 03:03:43,950
You work out?

2380
03:03:43,950 --> 03:03:45,950
Not in five years. No? Okay.

2381
03:03:45,950 --> 03:03:48,379
Let's get this out of the way.

2382
03:03:48,379 --> 03:03:50,379
Can you get that out of there, Jeff?

2383
03:03:50,379 --> 03:03:52,379
Yeah.

2384
03:03:52,379 --> 03:03:54,379
Man, you really are stinky.

2385
03:03:54,379 --> 03:03:56,379
Or is that me?

2386
03:03:56,379 --> 03:03:58,379
I think that's you at this point because I took a shower.

2387
03:03:58,379 --> 03:04:00,379
That's not me.

2388
03:04:00,379 --> 03:04:02,379
I mean, I did soil myself.

2389
03:04:02,379 --> 03:04:04,379
I tell you what.

2390
03:04:04,379 --> 03:04:06,379
Why don't you hit around here

2391
03:04:06,379 --> 03:04:08,379
or something, okay? Give it the sweet touch.

2392
03:04:08,379 --> 03:04:10,379
Right here? Yeah. You wouldn't do it?

2393
03:04:10,379 --> 03:04:12,379
No, it's all you. It's your house.

2394
03:04:12,379 --> 03:04:14,379
Okay. How about right in the middle?

2395
03:04:14,379 --> 03:04:16,379
I feel significantly unsafe.

2396
03:04:16,379 --> 03:04:18,379
That's all I want to say.

2397
03:04:18,379 --> 03:04:20,379
What's it? Mario? You played Mario?

2398
03:04:20,379 --> 03:04:22,379
Whatever it is you're doing, I don't think.

2399
03:04:22,379 --> 03:04:24,379
Oh, so long,

2400
03:04:24,379 --> 03:04:26,379
you bouser!

2401
03:04:26,379 --> 03:04:35,469
Get down, you bastard!

2402
03:04:35,469 --> 03:04:38,739
Motherfucker!

2403
03:04:38,739 --> 03:04:40,739
You got a bunch of studs there.

2404
03:04:40,739 --> 03:04:42,739
Are there studs in the wall? Yeah.

2405
03:04:42,739 --> 03:04:44,739
What do we do about that? You're gonna have to take those down

2406
03:04:44,739 --> 03:04:46,739
at some point.

2407
03:04:46,739 --> 03:04:50,959
Let me use my hands.

2408
03:04:50,959 --> 03:04:52,959
Why don't you take a swing, Jeff?

2409
03:04:52,959 --> 03:04:54,959
Why don't you take a swing?

2410
03:04:54,959 --> 03:05:03,729
Oh, that's perfect!

2411
03:05:03,729 --> 03:05:06,930
We can...

2412
03:05:06,930 --> 03:05:08,930
Yeah, man. Oh, wowee!

2413
03:05:08,930 --> 03:05:10,930
I'm strong! Wowee!

2414
03:05:10,930 --> 03:05:12,930
You did that all by yourself?

2415
03:05:12,930 --> 03:05:15,229
Hold on, let me...

2416
03:05:15,229 --> 03:05:17,229
Hold on a second.

2417
03:05:17,229 --> 03:05:21,069
Sweet Lord.

2418
03:05:21,069 --> 03:05:23,069
I got you.

2419
03:05:23,069 --> 03:05:25,069
I got you.

2420
03:05:28,139 --> 03:05:30,139
Oh, Lord.

2421
03:05:30,139 --> 03:05:32,139
I'm gonna be feeling that for a while.

2422
03:05:32,139 --> 03:05:34,139
All right.

2423
03:05:34,139 --> 03:05:36,139
Okay, that ain't hard either.

2424
03:05:36,139 --> 03:05:38,139
What's left? What the heck is that thing?

2425
03:05:38,139 --> 03:05:40,139
What is it? Is it painting?

2426
03:05:40,139 --> 03:05:42,139
Yeah, you can probably get this down if you need to.

2427
03:05:42,139 --> 03:05:44,139
Can I get this down?

2428
03:05:44,139 --> 03:05:46,139
Watch out, Jeff.

2429
03:05:46,139 --> 03:05:48,139
No, please don't. Okay.

2430
03:05:48,139 --> 03:05:50,579
I'm at your house, man.

2431
03:05:50,579 --> 03:05:57,229
Yeah, so that's meant...

2432
03:05:57,229 --> 03:05:59,229
That's meant for structure. I don't think that's...

2433
03:05:59,229 --> 03:06:01,229
I would probably use the screwdriver.

2434
03:06:01,229 --> 03:06:03,229
You want to do that?

2435
03:06:03,229 --> 03:06:05,229
I would do it.

2436
03:06:05,229 --> 03:06:07,229
By the way, I asked for a cookie.

2437
03:06:07,229 --> 03:06:10,159
You're right.

2438
03:06:10,159 --> 03:06:14,450
He did ask for a cookie.

2439
03:06:14,450 --> 03:06:17,649
I'll get him a cookie, okay?

2440
03:06:17,649 --> 03:06:29,860
He asked for it. Fine.

2441
03:06:29,860 --> 03:06:34,129
Why is that down here?

2442
03:06:34,129 --> 03:06:43,219
Make no sense.

2443
03:06:43,219 --> 03:07:02,530
Just bringing him up.

2444
03:07:02,530 --> 03:07:04,530
Jeff, bring him up!

2445
03:07:04,530 --> 03:07:06,530
You want a cookie, you want food, of course.

2446
03:07:06,530 --> 03:07:10,819
Got to be a good neighbor.

2447
03:07:10,819 --> 03:07:12,819
Got to be a good neighbor!

2448
03:07:12,819 --> 03:07:18,379
Jeff!

2449
03:07:18,379 --> 03:07:20,690
How are you? How are you doing?

2450
03:07:20,690 --> 03:07:22,690
I've got some cookies for you.

2451
03:07:22,690 --> 03:07:24,690
Thank you. You make those yourself? Yes, I do.

2452
03:07:24,690 --> 03:07:26,690
It kind of looks like my mother made those.

2453
03:07:26,690 --> 03:07:28,690
Would you like one? Yeah, I wouldn't mind.

2454
03:07:28,690 --> 03:07:30,690
It kind of tastes like sand. I just didn't want to touch it

2455
03:07:30,690 --> 03:07:32,690
because I've been touching the ground.

2456
03:07:32,690 --> 03:07:34,690
I don't know if I should...

2457
03:07:34,690 --> 03:07:36,690
I'm not sure if I should eat with these hands or not.

2458
03:07:36,690 --> 03:07:38,690
Could you feed it to me?

2459
03:07:38,690 --> 03:07:41,819
Want to smell them? Yeah.

2460
03:07:41,819 --> 03:07:43,819
They smell great.

2461
03:07:43,819 --> 03:07:45,819
I'm sorry about that.

2462
03:07:45,819 --> 03:07:48,450
Oh, Lord.

2463
03:07:48,450 --> 03:07:50,450
Let me ask you something.

2464
03:07:50,450 --> 03:07:52,450
You built this house yourself or you bought it?

2465
03:07:52,450 --> 03:07:54,450
What's that?

2466
03:07:54,450 --> 03:07:56,450
You built this house yourself or you bought it?

2467
03:07:56,450 --> 03:07:58,450
I bought this house. It was upgraded a few times.

2468
03:07:58,450 --> 03:08:00,450
This is strange.

2469
03:08:00,450 --> 03:08:02,450
There's no reason to have this

2470
03:08:02,450 --> 03:08:04,450
in a closet.

2471
03:08:04,450 --> 03:08:06,450
And listen to this, right?

2472
03:08:06,450 --> 03:08:08,819
Yep.

2473
03:08:08,819 --> 03:08:10,819
This is not mine.

2474
03:08:10,819 --> 03:08:13,120
Look at this.

2475
03:08:13,120 --> 03:08:15,120
Holy shit. That is real weird.

2476
03:08:15,120 --> 03:08:17,360
Is there something behind here?

2477
03:08:17,360 --> 03:08:19,360
By the way, we might be able to take this down

2478
03:08:19,360 --> 03:08:21,360
but I am not sure to be honest with you.

2479
03:08:21,360 --> 03:08:23,360
Oh, okay.

2480
03:08:23,360 --> 03:08:25,360
I'm just going to step over.

2481
03:08:25,360 --> 03:08:27,360
Get this fucking thing down!

2482
03:08:27,360 --> 03:08:29,360
We can't get the door frame down.

2483
03:08:35,329 --> 03:08:37,329
I'm not sure about that.

2484
03:08:37,329 --> 03:08:39,329
There's a painting in here, Jeb.

2485
03:08:39,329 --> 03:08:41,329
Really interesting.

2486
03:08:41,329 --> 03:08:43,329
I want to see what's back there.

2487
03:08:43,329 --> 03:08:45,329
I don't know what that is.

2488
03:08:45,329 --> 03:08:47,329
I mean, the weird part is that whole painting

2489
03:08:47,329 --> 03:08:49,329
is kind of like stuck to the wall.

2490
03:08:49,329 --> 03:08:51,329
It's like glued.

2491
03:08:51,329 --> 03:08:53,329
It's like the previous owner put something there.

2492
03:08:53,329 --> 03:08:55,329
Hold on. Let me see. Can I cut it?

2493
03:08:55,329 --> 03:08:57,329
How old is this house?

2494
03:08:57,329 --> 03:08:59,329
Hold on. Can I cut through it?

2495
03:08:59,329 --> 03:09:01,819
You got to put a little more effort into it.

2496
03:09:01,819 --> 03:09:07,649
Have you ever used that in your life?

2497
03:09:07,649 --> 03:09:09,649
I've never used one of these before.

2498
03:09:09,649 --> 03:09:11,649
I mean, in real life either.

2499
03:09:11,649 --> 03:09:13,649
Okay. First time for everything. That's all right.

2500
03:09:13,649 --> 03:09:18,180
Okay.

2501
03:09:18,180 --> 03:09:20,180
Why would there be a painting back here?

2502
03:09:20,180 --> 03:09:22,739
I mean, I guess it could be some sort of

2503
03:09:22,739 --> 03:09:24,739
shrine. Jeb.

2504
03:09:24,739 --> 03:09:26,739
You did say there were demons in the house.

2505
03:09:26,739 --> 03:09:29,680
Give me the sledgehammer. Okay.

2506
03:09:29,680 --> 03:09:31,680
You did say there were demons in the house.

2507
03:09:31,680 --> 03:09:33,680
Maybe someone was trying to do some sort of, you know.

2508
03:09:33,680 --> 03:09:35,680
Jeb, give me the sledgehammer. Okay, I'm going to walk away now.

2509
03:09:35,680 --> 03:09:41,250
You going to give a little force to it?

2510
03:09:41,250 --> 03:09:45,280
Jeb.

2511
03:09:45,280 --> 03:09:51,739
Okay, you're not really good at that.

2512
03:09:51,739 --> 03:09:53,739
There's definitely something back here, Jeb.

2513
03:09:53,739 --> 03:09:57,649
What do you think's back there?

2514
03:09:57,649 --> 03:09:59,649
It's made of steel.

2515
03:09:59,649 --> 03:10:02,659
Are you kidding me?

2516
03:10:02,659 --> 03:10:04,659
Holy shit, there are screws here. Hold on.

2517
03:10:04,659 --> 03:10:08,049
Okay.

2518
03:10:08,049 --> 03:10:10,049
There's that too.

2519
03:10:10,049 --> 03:10:12,049
I mean, you really can't cut that.

2520
03:10:12,049 --> 03:10:14,049
I'm scared.

2521
03:10:14,049 --> 03:10:16,049
Have you ever been to the dentist, Jeb?

2522
03:10:16,049 --> 03:10:18,049
I have never been. No thank you.

2523
03:10:18,049 --> 03:10:21,889
No thank you.

2524
03:10:21,889 --> 03:10:23,889
All right.

2525
03:10:23,889 --> 03:10:26,260
That's the wrong way.

2526
03:10:26,260 --> 03:10:28,260
I bet you could cut through it if you'd like.

2527
03:10:28,260 --> 03:10:30,260
Jeb, how do you get this to go in reverse?

2528
03:10:30,260 --> 03:10:32,260
Let me see. You go ahead and try.

2529
03:10:32,260 --> 03:10:34,260
I'll take care of everything for you.

2530
03:10:34,260 --> 03:10:36,260
Can it go in reverse?

2531
03:10:36,260 --> 03:10:38,260
Yeah, this is the wrong thing. That ain't going to work.

2532
03:10:38,260 --> 03:10:40,260
Okay, I'll tell you what.

2533
03:10:40,260 --> 03:10:42,260
Where's that knife?

2534
03:10:42,260 --> 03:10:44,260
Jeb, be careful. It's hard to cut through.

2535
03:10:44,260 --> 03:10:46,260
I'll be careful, all right?

2536
03:10:46,260 --> 03:10:48,260
Jeb, be very careful.

2537
03:10:48,260 --> 03:10:50,260
It's a very sharp knife. Thank you, my liege.

2538
03:10:50,260 --> 03:10:52,260
Be careful.

2539
03:10:52,260 --> 03:10:54,260
So you moved here, how long ago?

2540
03:10:54,260 --> 03:10:56,260
A week ago, two weeks ago.

2541
03:10:56,260 --> 03:10:58,260
Are you married at all? No.

2542
03:10:58,260 --> 03:11:00,260
I've never been married, not married.

2543
03:11:00,260 --> 03:11:02,260
Okay, why not?

2544
03:11:02,260 --> 03:11:04,260
Because I'm not ready yet.

2545
03:11:04,260 --> 03:11:06,260
You know, somebody asked me the same question

2546
03:11:06,260 --> 03:11:08,260
a week ago, the same exact thing.

2547
03:11:08,260 --> 03:11:10,260
The sleep demons are telling you something?

2548
03:11:10,260 --> 03:11:12,260
No, somebody that may even be part of your family.

2549
03:11:12,260 --> 03:11:14,260
I don't know.

2550
03:11:14,260 --> 03:11:16,260
Excuse me?

2551
03:11:16,260 --> 03:11:18,260
Just focus on that. It's a very sharp blade.

2552
03:11:18,260 --> 03:11:20,260
Sorry, I've done this a couple times.

2553
03:11:20,260 --> 03:11:22,260
Unfortunately.

2554
03:11:22,260 --> 03:11:24,260
This is the most sturdy painting.

2555
03:11:24,260 --> 03:11:26,260
There's been a few times in my life

2556
03:11:26,260 --> 03:11:28,260
that I've had to take down a painting

2557
03:11:28,260 --> 03:11:30,260
via a razor blade.

2558
03:11:30,260 --> 03:11:32,260
We're almost done. I'm going to let you do the...

2559
03:11:32,260 --> 03:11:34,260
You got it? I'm going to let you do most of the work.

2560
03:11:34,260 --> 03:11:36,260
Okay.

2561
03:11:36,260 --> 03:11:38,260
Looks good. You seen the fitness...

2562
03:11:38,260 --> 03:11:40,260
Instructor?

2563
03:11:40,260 --> 03:11:42,260
Yeah, you might want to do that.

2564
03:11:42,260 --> 03:11:44,260
Has he gone in your house? Oh, yeah.

2565
03:11:44,260 --> 03:11:46,260
He goes in your house, too?

2566
03:11:46,260 --> 03:11:48,260
Why do you let him do that?

2567
03:11:48,260 --> 03:11:50,260
That's like his own home invasion.

2568
03:11:50,260 --> 03:11:52,260
You didn't sign the HOA?

2569
03:11:52,260 --> 03:11:54,260
No, what HOA?

2570
03:11:54,260 --> 03:11:56,260
Let me see that knife.

2571
03:11:56,260 --> 03:11:58,260
You want the knife? Yeah.

2572
03:11:58,260 --> 03:12:00,260
There you are. I want to get this away from everybody.

2573
03:12:00,260 --> 03:12:02,260
Oh, I understand.

2574
03:12:02,260 --> 03:12:04,260
Can we get in there? Yeah, let me see.

2575
03:12:04,260 --> 03:12:06,260
There's something back here, I think.

2576
03:12:06,260 --> 03:12:08,260
There's something...

2577
03:12:08,260 --> 03:12:10,260
Good Lord.

2578
03:12:10,260 --> 03:12:17,040
Holy shit!

2579
03:12:17,040 --> 03:12:19,040
What is that?

2580
03:12:19,040 --> 03:12:21,040
What is this?

2581
03:12:21,040 --> 03:12:23,040
There's a safe back here?

2582
03:12:23,040 --> 03:12:25,040
What is that?

2583
03:12:25,040 --> 03:12:27,040
You said you bought this house?

2584
03:12:27,040 --> 03:12:29,040
Okay.

2585
03:12:29,040 --> 03:12:31,040
Oh, my God! It's a safe!

2586
03:12:31,040 --> 03:12:33,040
You know how to get that open or not?

2587
03:12:33,040 --> 03:12:35,040
I don't know the code! Hold on, let me try.

2588
03:12:35,040 --> 03:12:41,379
Okay.

2589
03:12:41,379 --> 03:12:43,379
Let me just double-check. Have you ever opened a safe before?

2590
03:12:43,379 --> 03:12:45,379
Because I'm finding there are a significant number of things

2591
03:12:45,379 --> 03:12:47,379
you've never done. I watch YouTube videos that can explain it.

2592
03:12:47,379 --> 03:12:49,379
You listen for the little...

2593
03:12:49,379 --> 03:12:52,260
Okay. You hear that?

2594
03:12:52,260 --> 03:12:54,260
Right there?

2595
03:12:54,260 --> 03:12:56,260
Okay.

2596
03:12:56,260 --> 03:12:58,260
Yeah, I don't hear nothing. I can't get it.

2597
03:12:58,260 --> 03:13:00,500
You could sledgehammer it.

2598
03:13:00,500 --> 03:13:02,500
Maybe.

2599
03:13:02,500 --> 03:13:04,500
I do know a guy.

2600
03:13:04,500 --> 03:13:06,500
I swear to God, this house was built five days ago.

2601
03:13:06,500 --> 03:13:08,500
That's weird.

2602
03:13:08,500 --> 03:13:10,500
Okay, I may accept to you. I know a guy.

2603
03:13:10,500 --> 03:13:12,500
If you need help. I know a locksmith who can call.

2604
03:13:12,500 --> 03:13:14,500
You know a guy?

2605
03:13:14,500 --> 03:13:16,500
I know a guy. I got a guy for everything.

2606
03:13:16,500 --> 03:13:18,500
We could break it, too.

2607
03:13:18,500 --> 03:13:20,500
You want to try? We could.

2608
03:13:20,500 --> 03:13:22,500
Listen, I don't have a significant amount of confidence

2609
03:13:22,500 --> 03:13:24,500
that you're going to be able to break that safe

2610
03:13:24,500 --> 03:13:26,500
if you couldn't break that wall down.

2611
03:13:26,500 --> 03:13:28,500
But that's just me.

2612
03:13:28,500 --> 03:13:30,500
That's all right.

2613
03:13:30,500 --> 03:13:32,500
If you want to give it a shot.

2614
03:13:32,500 --> 03:13:34,500
Give your guy a call.

2615
03:13:34,500 --> 03:13:36,500
Can I borrow your phone though?

2616
03:13:36,500 --> 03:13:38,500
It's downstairs.

2617
03:13:38,500 --> 03:13:40,500
It's down in the kitchen.

2618
03:13:40,500 --> 03:13:42,500
You know a guy that can come do this?

2619
03:13:42,500 --> 03:13:46,459
Yeah, give me two seconds.

2620
03:13:46,459 --> 03:13:48,459
He knows a guy.

2621
03:13:48,459 --> 03:13:52,299
To open the safe?

2622
03:13:52,299 --> 03:13:54,989
I don't know what's in it.

2623
03:13:54,989 --> 03:13:56,989
This is an upgrade.

2624
03:13:56,989 --> 03:13:58,989
I didn't know this was even in here.

2625
03:13:58,989 --> 03:14:00,989
Was this part of the foundation?

2626
03:14:00,989 --> 03:14:02,989
What are you, stupid?

2627
03:14:02,989 --> 03:14:04,989
We're like on a second story.

2628
03:14:06,989 --> 03:14:14,350
He knows a guy. Call him.

2629
03:14:14,350 --> 03:14:16,350
I think people like tools because of the sounds they make.

2630
03:14:16,350 --> 03:14:18,350
You think that, too?

2631
03:14:18,350 --> 03:14:20,350
You guys think that, too?

2632
03:14:20,350 --> 03:14:22,350
You know what I mean? It's like, oh yeah, let me get my tool.

2633
03:14:22,350 --> 03:14:24,979
It feels very like

2634
03:14:24,979 --> 03:14:26,979
manly.

2635
03:14:26,979 --> 03:14:28,979
Like, oh yeah, let me get my tool.

2636
03:14:28,979 --> 03:14:30,979
How you doing, man?

2637
03:14:30,979 --> 03:14:32,979
Okay, you're not busy right now.

2638
03:14:32,979 --> 03:14:34,979
Listen, I got a thing or two

2639
03:14:34,979 --> 03:14:36,979
to get taken care of.

2640
03:14:36,979 --> 03:14:39,920
You want to come on down, get her down?

2641
03:14:39,920 --> 03:14:41,920
Yeah, come on over pronto.

2642
03:14:41,920 --> 03:14:43,920
I got a little bit of a situation I could use your help with.

2643
03:14:43,920 --> 03:14:45,920
Okay?

2644
03:14:45,920 --> 03:14:47,920
Yeah. No problem.

2645
03:14:47,920 --> 03:14:49,920
Okay.

2646
03:14:49,920 --> 03:14:59,520
America, alright.

2647
03:14:59,520 --> 03:15:09,700
I can't get in. I don't know the combo.

2648
03:15:09,700 --> 03:15:11,700
Hey, can you get the door?

2649
03:15:11,700 --> 03:15:13,700
Yeah, I got you.

2650
03:15:13,700 --> 03:15:15,700
If it's your guy, I don't want to

2651
03:15:15,700 --> 03:15:18,770
greet him. You know him.

2652
03:15:18,770 --> 03:15:21,200
Come on in.

2653
03:15:21,200 --> 03:15:24,079
Hey, Jeff.

2654
03:15:24,079 --> 03:15:26,079
Hey, how's it going, my guy?

2655
03:15:26,079 --> 03:15:28,079
Good to see you. Oh, you are a blue collar as always.

2656
03:15:28,079 --> 03:15:30,079
Come on in, come on in.

2657
03:15:30,079 --> 03:15:32,079
Listen, if you could keep this on the

2658
03:15:32,079 --> 03:15:34,079
down low, alright, I got a safe situation

2659
03:15:34,079 --> 03:15:36,079
up there. I need someone to crack it.

2660
03:15:36,079 --> 03:15:38,079
I want to make sure that, I'll make sure

2661
03:15:38,079 --> 03:15:40,079
you get paid, if you know what I mean. Sure.

2662
03:15:40,079 --> 03:15:42,079
Yeah, alright. Let's head upstairs.

2663
03:15:42,079 --> 03:15:44,079
I think for you, Jeff. Thank you, brother.

2664
03:15:44,079 --> 03:15:46,079
It's not your place, right? Down the street.

2665
03:15:46,079 --> 03:15:48,079
Oh, no, no, no, not for sure.

2666
03:15:48,079 --> 03:15:50,079
Keep going, keep going.

2667
03:15:51,079 --> 03:15:53,079
It's an confusing layout.

2668
03:15:53,079 --> 03:15:55,079
I'm going to tell you right now. That makes no fucking sense.

2669
03:15:55,079 --> 03:15:57,079
That makes zero sense.

2670
03:15:57,079 --> 03:15:59,079
He's trying to paint his wall pink

2671
03:15:59,079 --> 03:16:01,079
and black, pink up there.

2672
03:16:01,079 --> 03:16:03,079
That sounds dumb. You can go up the stairs.

2673
03:16:03,079 --> 03:16:05,079
It could be gems, jewels,

2674
03:16:05,079 --> 03:16:07,079
gold, there might be gold in there.

2675
03:16:07,079 --> 03:16:09,260
Gold still expensive.

2676
03:16:09,260 --> 03:16:12,010
If it's gold,

2677
03:16:12,010 --> 03:16:14,010
that's awesome.

2678
03:16:14,010 --> 03:16:16,010
Who would put a safe in a wall? That's ridiculous.

2679
03:16:18,010 --> 03:16:20,010
Why would you put a safe in a wall?

2680
03:16:20,010 --> 03:16:22,500
Unless it was to hide something very, very important.

2681
03:16:22,500 --> 03:16:24,500
Hey. What?

2682
03:16:24,500 --> 03:16:26,940
How are you?

2683
03:16:26,940 --> 03:16:28,940
What the fuck is this? A little bit of a war zone up here.

2684
03:16:28,940 --> 03:16:30,940
We swear, when we come in a room.

2685
03:16:30,940 --> 03:16:32,940
Okay. Alright.

2686
03:16:32,940 --> 03:16:34,940
This is my guy. That's your guy?

2687
03:16:34,940 --> 03:16:36,940
He can take care of pretty much anything.

2688
03:16:36,940 --> 03:16:38,940
What's your name? What's up?

2689
03:16:38,940 --> 03:16:40,940
I'm a locksmith. He doesn't need to know, right?

2690
03:16:40,940 --> 03:16:42,940
You're good.

2691
03:16:42,940 --> 03:16:44,940
We have a safe here.

2692
03:16:44,940 --> 03:16:46,940
I didn't want to break it, didn't want to swing at it or anything.

2693
03:16:46,940 --> 03:16:48,940
But it's here.

2694
03:16:48,940 --> 03:16:50,940
I just, can you get into this?

2695
03:16:50,940 --> 03:16:52,940
For the record, have you tried to get into it while I was gone?

2696
03:16:52,940 --> 03:16:54,940
I tried.

2697
03:16:54,940 --> 03:16:56,940
Why would I know a combination of a safe? I don't know.

2698
03:16:56,940 --> 03:16:58,940
Since you say, this should be pretty standard.

2699
03:16:58,940 --> 03:17:00,940
Was it behind anything?

2700
03:17:00,940 --> 03:17:02,940
It was a painting and a wall.

2701
03:17:02,940 --> 03:17:04,940
He's a neighbor.

2702
03:17:04,940 --> 03:17:07,180
Religious.

2703
03:17:07,180 --> 03:17:09,350
Does it mean anything?

2704
03:17:09,350 --> 03:17:11,350
Does it give you insight?

2705
03:17:11,350 --> 03:17:13,350
Does it mean anything?

2706
03:17:13,350 --> 03:17:15,350
Can you just let me?

2707
03:17:15,350 --> 03:17:17,350
You can stick the painting, something.

2708
03:17:17,350 --> 03:17:19,350
Listen, do you...

2709
03:17:19,350 --> 03:17:21,350
That's a hot locksmith.

2710
03:17:21,350 --> 03:17:23,350
I just want to make sure that's clear.

2711
03:17:23,350 --> 03:17:25,350
What's up?

2712
03:17:25,350 --> 03:17:27,350
You called over one of the most attractive locksmiths I've ever met in my whole life.

2713
03:17:27,350 --> 03:17:29,350
I just want to know.

2714
03:17:29,350 --> 03:17:31,350
He's a good looking man.

2715
03:17:31,350 --> 03:17:33,350
Can you not come on to me? I'm trying to do my job. Appreciate that.

2716
03:17:33,350 --> 03:17:35,350
Just keep doing what you're doing.

2717
03:17:35,350 --> 03:17:37,350
It's like an ocean violation.

2718
03:17:37,350 --> 03:17:39,350
He's really, really sweet.

2719
03:17:39,350 --> 03:17:41,350
How many days did Moses ride the boat?

2720
03:17:41,350 --> 03:17:43,350
How long was the rain?

2721
03:17:43,350 --> 03:17:45,350
A week.

2722
03:17:45,350 --> 03:17:47,350
The rain?

2723
03:17:47,350 --> 03:17:49,350
Forty days and forty nights.

2724
03:17:49,350 --> 03:17:51,350
Forty days and forty nights.

2725
03:17:51,350 --> 03:17:53,350
What's the time frame on you getting into that?

2726
03:17:53,350 --> 03:17:55,350
Safe.

2727
03:17:55,350 --> 03:17:57,350
Are you rushing me?

2728
03:17:57,350 --> 03:17:59,350
No, I just was curious. I don't know how long it took.

2729
03:17:59,350 --> 03:18:01,350
Okay, well I hope he gets it.

2730
03:18:01,350 --> 03:18:03,350
I'm going to ask you a quick question.

2731
03:18:03,350 --> 03:18:05,350
Are you familiar with the idea that

2732
03:18:05,350 --> 03:18:07,350
possession is nine-tenths of the law?

2733
03:18:07,350 --> 03:18:09,350
You're going to have to say that again

2734
03:18:09,350 --> 03:18:11,350
and explain like I'm five.

2735
03:18:11,350 --> 03:18:13,350
They say

2736
03:18:13,350 --> 03:18:15,350
possession is nine-tenths of the law.

2737
03:18:15,350 --> 03:18:17,350
You understand that?

2738
03:18:17,350 --> 03:18:19,350
Okay, so conceptually it would mean

2739
03:18:19,350 --> 03:18:21,350
you know what nine-tenths is?

2740
03:18:21,350 --> 03:18:23,350
It means nine out of ten.

2741
03:18:23,350 --> 03:18:25,350
Hold on.

2742
03:18:25,350 --> 03:18:27,350
How many percentages is that?

2743
03:18:27,350 --> 03:18:29,590
I think here's the point.

2744
03:18:29,590 --> 03:18:31,590
Whoever has what's in that safe

2745
03:18:31,590 --> 03:18:33,590
owns it.

2746
03:18:33,590 --> 03:18:35,590
You understand?

2747
03:18:35,590 --> 03:18:38,920
You're just making no sense to me.

2748
03:18:38,920 --> 03:18:40,920
I can't get it.

2749
03:18:40,920 --> 03:18:42,920
What do you mean you can't get it? I'm fucking with you. I'm the best.

2750
03:18:42,920 --> 03:18:44,920
Okay.

2751
03:18:44,920 --> 03:18:46,920
You want to get in there?

2752
03:18:46,920 --> 03:18:48,920
What's in it?

2753
03:18:48,920 --> 03:18:50,920
Okay, okay.

2754
03:18:50,920 --> 03:18:52,920
Wait, wait, wait.

2755
03:18:52,920 --> 03:18:54,920
Wait a second. Wait a minute.

2756
03:18:54,920 --> 03:18:56,920
We have to have a conversation.

2757
03:18:56,920 --> 03:18:58,920
Let me see that.

2758
03:18:58,920 --> 03:19:00,920
Possession is nine-tenths of the law.

2759
03:19:00,920 --> 03:19:02,920
No, I have no clue.

2760
03:19:02,920 --> 03:19:04,920
You got the safe open.

2761
03:19:04,920 --> 03:19:06,920
It's a pleasure to work with you as well.

2762
03:19:06,920 --> 03:19:08,920
You got the safe open.

2763
03:19:08,920 --> 03:19:10,920
You got the safe open.

2764
03:19:10,920 --> 03:19:12,920
Thank you. Let me see what's in there.

2765
03:19:12,920 --> 03:19:14,920
What if we just figure out payment?

2766
03:19:14,920 --> 03:19:16,920
Let me see what's in the safe.

2767
03:19:16,920 --> 03:19:18,920
Let me see what's in the safe.

2768
03:19:18,920 --> 03:19:20,920
Get downstairs now.

2769
03:19:20,920 --> 03:19:22,920
Why are we going downstairs?

2770
03:19:22,920 --> 03:19:24,920
I want everybody out of this room because I don't want to be up here.

2771
03:19:24,920 --> 03:19:26,920
Get downstairs.

2772
03:19:26,920 --> 03:19:28,920
You might want to pocket some of that.

2773
03:19:28,920 --> 03:19:30,920
It's my goddamn house. Whatever's in the wall is mine.

2774
03:19:30,920 --> 03:19:32,920
That's absolute bullshit.

2775
03:19:32,920 --> 03:19:34,920
I'm not comfortable with you touching

2776
03:19:34,920 --> 03:19:36,920
all of the stuff that's in a

2777
03:19:36,920 --> 03:19:38,920
wall in my house.

2778
03:19:38,920 --> 03:19:40,920
You didn't even know it was there, though.

2779
03:19:40,920 --> 03:19:42,920
It's my house, so you took it from my house.

2780
03:19:42,920 --> 03:19:44,920
He didn't build this house.

2781
03:19:44,920 --> 03:19:46,920
I don't believe in private property, actually.

2782
03:19:46,920 --> 03:19:48,920
He didn't build this house. Hallelujah, brother.

2783
03:19:48,920 --> 03:19:50,920
Hold on.

2784
03:19:50,920 --> 03:19:52,920
Let's get an ad break.

2785
03:19:52,920 --> 03:19:54,920
Ad break. I want to get this sorted.

2786
03:19:54,920 --> 03:19:56,920
I'm sorry. What did you say?

2787
03:19:56,920 --> 03:19:58,920
Just go into the kitchen.

2788
03:19:58,920 --> 03:20:00,920
What is this guy talking about?

2789
03:20:00,920 --> 03:20:02,920
Ad break now.

2790
03:20:02,920 --> 03:20:04,920
We're going to sort this.

2791
03:20:04,920 --> 03:27:00,469
Don't hand people money that didn't do it.

2792
03:27:00,469 --> 03:27:02,469
I wanted to go over a couple of things

2793
03:27:02,469 --> 03:27:04,469
kind of off camera

2794
03:27:04,469 --> 03:27:06,469
with just no

2795
03:27:06,469 --> 03:27:08,469
jokes or anything.

2796
03:27:08,469 --> 03:27:10,469
I want to talk about the show and how it

2797
03:27:10,469 --> 03:27:12,469
even was able to happen in the first place.

2798
03:27:12,469 --> 03:27:14,469
Coinbase

2799
03:27:14,469 --> 03:27:16,469
came in at the last second

2800
03:27:16,469 --> 03:27:18,469
and let us be able

2801
03:27:18,469 --> 03:27:20,649
to do the show.

2802
03:27:20,649 --> 03:27:22,649
When I say that, I mean

2803
03:27:22,649 --> 03:27:24,649
that. All the things you see

2804
03:27:24,649 --> 03:27:26,649
back here were really only possible

2805
03:27:26,649 --> 03:27:28,649
because of this company here.

2806
03:27:28,649 --> 03:27:30,649
I really mean that. I wouldn't say it if it wasn't true.

2807
03:27:30,649 --> 03:27:32,649
Twitch came in

2808
03:27:32,649 --> 03:27:34,649
and gave us a bunch of money. Coinbase gave us

2809
03:27:34,649 --> 03:27:36,649
a bunch of money.

2810
03:27:36,649 --> 03:27:38,649
What you see here is only because of those

2811
03:27:38,649 --> 03:27:40,649
two companies.

2812
03:27:40,649 --> 03:27:42,649
I couldn't afford any of this stuff.

2813
03:27:42,649 --> 03:27:44,649
There's no way I could have done any of this on my own.

2814
03:27:46,649 --> 03:27:48,649
When you talk about sponsorships,

2815
03:27:48,649 --> 03:27:50,649
talk about sponsors,

2816
03:27:50,649 --> 03:27:52,649
you've seen the show.

2817
03:27:52,649 --> 03:27:54,649
They've let us do whatever we want.

2818
03:27:54,649 --> 03:27:56,649
We didn't have to do anything.

2819
03:27:56,649 --> 03:27:58,649
Twitch and Coinbase,

2820
03:27:58,649 --> 03:28:01,530
they just let us do what we wanted.

2821
03:28:01,530 --> 03:28:03,530
I've used Coinbase

2822
03:28:03,530 --> 03:28:05,530
for the last five years.

2823
03:28:05,530 --> 03:28:07,530
Those of you who know this channel, I used to have an Ethereum

2824
03:28:07,530 --> 03:28:09,530
address that you could donate to.

2825
03:28:09,530 --> 03:28:12,090
It was real.

2826
03:28:12,090 --> 03:28:14,090
I have to thank them because without their support,

2827
03:28:14,090 --> 03:28:16,840
the show doesn't happen.

2828
03:28:16,840 --> 03:28:18,840
It doesn't happen without them.

2829
03:28:18,840 --> 03:28:20,840
Also, there's so many people to thank.

2830
03:28:20,840 --> 03:28:22,840
We're not going to have that much opportunity to thank everybody,

2831
03:28:22,840 --> 03:28:25,209
but seriously, I'm going to take the opportunity now.

2832
03:28:25,209 --> 03:28:27,209
But seriously, if you're into cryptocurrency,

2833
03:28:27,209 --> 03:28:29,209
if you want to learn more about the space,

2834
03:28:29,209 --> 03:28:31,209
it's a great place to start.

2835
03:28:31,209 --> 03:28:33,209
They gave us a significant amount of capital

2836
03:28:33,209 --> 03:28:35,209
to make this show happen.

2837
03:28:35,209 --> 03:28:37,209
Thank you, Coinbase. Thank you, Twitch.

2838
03:28:37,209 --> 03:28:39,209
Also, while I have a second here,

2839
03:28:39,209 --> 03:28:42,149
because this is the finale,

2840
03:28:42,149 --> 03:28:44,149
JK Productions, Community Jake,

2841
03:28:44,149 --> 03:28:46,459
this is impossible

2842
03:28:46,459 --> 03:28:48,459
without these people.

2843
03:28:48,459 --> 03:28:50,700
Andy Mark, Ghost Commander, Criken and his team,

2844
03:28:50,700 --> 03:28:53,260
this went off without a hitch.

2845
03:28:56,139 --> 03:28:58,139
It's seriously, sure, this is the idea

2846
03:28:58,139 --> 03:29:00,139
that I came up with, but you can't do this

2847
03:29:00,139 --> 03:29:02,309
without a ton of dedicated people.

2848
03:29:02,309 --> 03:29:04,809
The glass breaking, when we did that,

2849
03:29:04,809 --> 03:29:08,520
Andy Mark, the engineers in Andy Mark

2850
03:29:08,520 --> 03:29:10,520
came up with all this stuff.

2851
03:29:10,520 --> 03:29:13,450
There's so many people, Ludwig, Kit Boga,

2852
03:29:13,450 --> 03:29:15,450
Milton,

2853
03:29:15,450 --> 03:29:17,450
there's so many people back here that you don't see.

2854
03:29:17,450 --> 03:29:19,750
I wanted just to kind of address it real quick

2855
03:29:19,750 --> 03:29:22,250
because I wasn't going to have an opportunity to.

2856
03:29:22,250 --> 03:29:26,149
But again, I want to

2857
03:29:26,149 --> 03:29:28,149
focus on, there's so many people

2858
03:29:28,149 --> 03:29:30,579
to thank, there's so many people that made this happen,

2859
03:29:30,579 --> 03:29:32,579
but Coinbase,

2860
03:29:32,579 --> 03:29:34,889
go check them out, please do.

2861
03:29:34,889 --> 03:29:36,889
They gave us so much money to do this

2862
03:29:36,889 --> 03:29:38,889
and they just wanted to make a good show.

2863
03:29:38,889 --> 03:29:41,379
They wanted to make a good show.

2864
03:29:41,379 --> 03:29:43,379
And I think it has been. I think it's been a lot of fun.

2865
03:29:43,379 --> 03:29:45,750
So that's because of Twitch

2866
03:29:45,750 --> 03:29:47,750
and Coinbase. Thank you, both of you.

2867
03:29:47,750 --> 03:29:49,750
We'll go back to the show.

2868
03:29:49,750 --> 03:29:51,750
I've actually used Coinbase, I really have,

2869
03:29:51,750 --> 03:29:54,309
for five years.

2870
03:29:54,309 --> 03:29:57,059
I mean it. And I'll go back to the show, let's break the fourth one.

2871
03:29:57,059 --> 03:30:09,540
What's going on in here?

2872
03:30:09,540 --> 03:30:15,370
I thought that was a bug.

2873
03:30:15,370 --> 03:30:18,379
I told you to put that thing down.

2874
03:30:18,379 --> 03:30:21,639
Have you guys heard anything in the back?

2875
03:30:21,639 --> 03:30:24,010
I was just kind of back there just messing around a little bit.

2876
03:30:24,010 --> 03:30:26,010
Sure. We were just talking, I mean.

2877
03:30:26,010 --> 03:30:28,010
Yeah, you've got quite a bit of money here.

2878
03:30:28,010 --> 03:30:30,629
You've got quite a bit of money.

2879
03:30:30,629 --> 03:30:32,629
So, hypothetically speaking, we were thinking

2880
03:30:32,629 --> 03:30:34,629
we could make this whole thing go away.

2881
03:30:34,629 --> 03:30:36,629
Can I hold that?

2882
03:30:36,629 --> 03:30:38,629
I was talking to Jeb

2883
03:30:38,629 --> 03:30:40,629
and I figured we'd just split it, you know,

2884
03:30:40,629 --> 03:30:42,629
maybe three way.

2885
03:30:42,629 --> 03:30:44,629
Me, Jeb, and he has actually a dog

2886
03:30:44,629 --> 03:30:46,629
named Buck. You're going to do a three way

2887
03:30:46,629 --> 03:30:48,629
split? Between the three of us?

2888
03:30:48,629 --> 03:30:50,629
It's in my wall.

2889
03:30:50,629 --> 03:30:52,629
Who wouldn't have gotten in?

2890
03:30:52,629 --> 03:30:54,629
Let me count how much money this is.

2891
03:30:54,629 --> 03:30:56,629
I mean, hypothetically speaking, if we were to have taken the money

2892
03:30:56,629 --> 03:30:58,629
and walked away, no one would believe you.

2893
03:30:58,629 --> 03:31:00,629
We were honest. We should get honest money.

2894
03:31:00,629 --> 03:31:02,629
It's 1200 bucks.

2895
03:31:02,629 --> 03:31:04,629
That's pretty bad math.

2896
03:31:04,629 --> 03:31:06,629
We counted it when you were gone.

2897
03:31:06,629 --> 03:31:08,629
I didn't get much beyond the sixth grade

2898
03:31:08,629 --> 03:31:10,629
and I can tell you that ain't 1200 bucks.

2899
03:31:12,629 --> 03:31:14,629
From what you've done,

2900
03:31:14,629 --> 03:31:16,629
blue collar wise, you seem

2901
03:31:16,629 --> 03:31:18,629
to be quite slow

2902
03:31:18,629 --> 03:31:20,629
What?

2903
03:31:20,629 --> 03:31:22,629
The painting.

2904
03:31:22,629 --> 03:31:24,629
You seem a bit slow.

2905
03:31:24,629 --> 03:31:26,629
I'm very fast. Let me show you. Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat,

2906
03:31:26,629 --> 03:31:28,629
toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat

2907
03:31:28,629 --> 03:31:30,629
That's impressive.

2908
03:31:30,629 --> 03:31:32,629
Admittedly, nothing to do with blue collar.

2909
03:31:32,629 --> 03:31:34,629
It'd be crazy. It'd be an ocean violation just to do that.

2910
03:31:34,629 --> 03:31:36,629
Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat.

2911
03:31:36,629 --> 03:31:38,629
And I figured out that great white collar, so, you know, I gotta

2912
03:31:38,629 --> 03:31:40,629
I got a lawyer friend.

2913
03:31:40,629 --> 03:31:42,629
I just call them in. We just square it away.

2914
03:31:42,629 --> 03:31:44,629
I don't know why we need law in this.

2915
03:31:44,629 --> 03:31:47,590
I mean what do you want you want me to give you a hundred bucks and I'll give you a hundred bucks

2916
03:31:47,590 --> 03:31:53,510
How much is your fee? Zero change. You got a fee? My fee? Yeah, it's not a flat. It's percentage-based

2917
03:31:53,510 --> 03:31:57,110
And then there's a finder there's a finder's fee. There's a finder's fee. A finder's fee because I found it.

2918
03:31:57,110 --> 03:32:04,989
Let me just call him up. Let me just call him up. Oh finder's fee. My giant dollars of bills. Call your lawyer.

2919
03:32:04,989 --> 03:32:09,709
Sure. Get a lawyer in here. You realize you never would have found the money if it ain't were for us.

2920
03:32:09,709 --> 03:32:11,909
Is this Stevenson Stevenson Stevenson and Randy?

2921
03:32:12,909 --> 03:32:14,909
You should a lawyer down here

2922
03:32:15,629 --> 03:32:21,190
Weirdo at nine eight five nine eight. Yeah, why don't we just take this and put it like yeah, there's beer here

2923
03:32:21,190 --> 03:32:25,309
That ain't your money. That ain't your money. You might want to put it down there. But yeah, if you could just come down

2924
03:32:25,870 --> 03:32:27,870
We just got a dispute really

2925
03:32:28,790 --> 03:32:33,670
You mind if I have some of this bread? Go ahead have a piece of bread. He's being kind of a dick. Yeah

2926
03:32:34,709 --> 03:32:38,110
So, I don't know if we can just figure that out. That'd be great. I'll see you in a bit

2927
03:32:38,829 --> 03:32:42,110
Is that all you got in this house and bread this bread this mac and cheese up there

2928
03:32:42,110 --> 03:32:45,790
But it takes a while to make just forget it. Good to go for a homemade cookie. Yeah

2929
03:32:49,639 --> 03:32:56,799
So, you know a guy he knows about finders fees, you know is about your percentage. Oh, I'm so tired

2930
03:32:58,959 --> 03:33:00,959
We're doing everything for

2931
03:33:08,659 --> 03:33:13,020
Come on in wow, this is quite the establishment

2933
03:33:35,180 --> 03:33:36,379

Part of Stevenson Stevenson Stevenson and Randy. It's been a long day. I'm tired. Okay. Well, hey, I'm here from the

2935
03:33:42,700 --> 03:33:47,739
Property management law firm of Stevenson Stevenson Stevenson and Randy. Yeah, and I was called down

2936
03:33:47,739 --> 03:33:49,780
Well, let's first of all, this is quite a nice place

2937
03:33:49,780 --> 03:33:53,299
You got here just want to let you know a couple of things zoning rights that we have

2938
03:33:56,260 --> 03:34:01,020
Okay, all right now listen, what's what's the pickle we got I got $50,000 and I was in my

2939
03:34:02,020 --> 03:34:08,540
They want money okay, so here let me get you let me get it. Okay, you're stealing my electricity for a significant amount of time

2940
03:34:08,540 --> 03:34:09,579
I'll make that very clear

2941
03:34:09,579 --> 03:34:14,180
The only reason I was in this establishment is because he stole my electricity back in my day. We called that thievery

2942
03:34:14,180 --> 03:34:19,620
Oh thievery a hundred percent. Okay, that's a sin. That's in the Bible. Then I called my guy here

2943
03:34:19,620 --> 03:34:24,500
I called my guy. So it was a finders fee for me. I think that's legal. I think that's legal ease for I get money

2944
03:34:24,500 --> 03:34:28,819
That's right. I call my guy. Oh, he takes care of a thing. I mean look at it

2945
03:34:28,819 --> 03:34:30,819
Take anything

2946
03:34:35,780 --> 03:34:37,780
My wife was saying the same thing

2947
03:34:39,780 --> 03:34:41,180
Hey

2948
03:34:41,180 --> 03:34:45,459
So what are we doing here? This is what we're dealing with. Well, we need to disperse

2949
03:34:45,459 --> 03:34:50,420
Okay, so you found this line without a safe in the side of the room up there. Okay fucking those smithy granted

2950
03:34:50,420 --> 03:34:55,620
Well now you say we found the money. So you mean it wasn't just you who found the money

2951
03:34:56,260 --> 03:35:01,459
Was there some which one of you found it and he helped oh, I mean I found it okay

2952
03:35:03,059 --> 03:35:09,100
Well nine-tenths of the law not possession is nine-tenths, you know, you've ever heard possession is nine-tenths of law

2953
03:35:09,100 --> 03:35:11,100
Did he just fall asleep?

2954
03:35:11,819 --> 03:35:13,819
Hey, is he

2955
03:35:13,819 --> 03:35:15,819
Why is he literally sleeping right now?

2956
03:35:16,260 --> 03:35:20,899
Is that does that mean he doesn't want the money you think is that legal for it?

2957
03:35:21,540 --> 03:35:25,059
Maybe we'll just okay here. I'll tell you what we're gonna do. Okay

2958
03:35:25,620 --> 03:35:29,059
There's a little bit above my pay grade. I'm gonna have to go in. I

2959
03:35:29,739 --> 03:35:31,739
Think maybe what we should do

2960
03:35:32,940 --> 03:35:38,379
Is give him some equal representation. I'm gonna call another lawyer in okay. Why don't we do that? Yeah, that sounds great

Is this normal for you

Yeah, let me just quick. Why is he opening the door?

3026
03:43:45,360 --> 03:43:49,440
I just opened the door why you like it because I am with the fresh air in my home

All right

So this from what I understand this large sum of money was found in the wall in this on this property

3030
03:44:07,079 --> 03:44:09,079
And you assisted

3031
03:44:09,360 --> 03:44:14,200
Tearing down the wall and you assisted in opening the security device in order to obtain the money

3032
03:44:16,559 --> 03:44:22,760
Alright so here's here's how I pretty much knowing the law like I know the law because the law is the law and the law

3033
03:44:22,760 --> 03:44:25,280
Is the law this is what we are going to do. I know

3034
03:44:25,479 --> 03:44:27,479
That's three times in a row

3035
03:44:29,000 --> 03:44:31,559
Did I that effect how it did I

3036
03:44:32,959 --> 03:44:37,000
Alright, so here's how this is how we're gonna distribute the money. This is how it is now

3037
03:44:37,000 --> 03:44:43,200
I believe you had some electricity stolen from you, sir. Really quick, sir. I got a quick objection

3038
03:44:43,200 --> 03:44:45,200
He literally he may have just kissed a bear

3039
03:44:46,319 --> 03:44:50,319
That is a violation in this state

3040
03:44:57,450 --> 03:44:59,450
I got allergy

3041
03:45:01,889 --> 03:45:03,889
No, I'm allergic I got allergies

3042
03:45:06,649 --> 03:45:12,129
Yes, this is pretty much what this is how I'm gonna rule. Okay. All right, so here it is

3043
03:45:12,409 --> 03:45:20,569
Did you have electricity stolen from you? Absolutely. I think if we pay you fair kilowatt hour rates, and I think that time in time in

3044
03:45:21,170 --> 03:45:27,610
Also, you were doing some handy work up there emotional damages well, were you very happy about this? Yes

3045
03:45:27,770 --> 03:45:31,889
Okay, emotional damages to us. I think you are you think you're allowed that amount

3046
03:45:33,569 --> 03:45:37,450
Were you I open the safe safe that you have to drive

3047
03:45:43,889 --> 03:45:49,090
I think you get you get that amount. Have a good day. That's some gorgeous here. Go buy some more hair product

3048
03:45:49,090 --> 03:45:51,090
You get that

3049
03:45:52,930 --> 03:46:00,809
I have not seen you two in a while. It's in the barrett. Don't bother. Okay, make sure you're there tonight for supper

3050
03:46:02,530 --> 03:46:06,309
I'm gonna go ahead and keep this for lawyer. What? Thank you. It's like paperclip

3051
03:46:06,309 --> 03:46:09,889
I need the bear to actually open the door this time. I think this is done. Let's go. I

3052
03:46:10,809 --> 03:46:12,809
Did the bear open the door to the house?

3053
03:46:14,809 --> 03:46:26,159
What just happened what they'll leave with the money

3054
03:46:26,819 --> 03:46:29,879
Where's the money?

3055
03:46:34,879 --> 03:46:43,309
Bear hat it's like human arms. How much money did we lose? They took everything

3056
03:46:46,309 --> 03:46:55,739
Just like didn't plan that a guy who's like a big bear head is right here. Uh, great

3057
03:46:56,540 --> 03:47:02,250
But if you got in the house you're like long somebody

3058
03:47:03,530 --> 03:47:05,530
Okay, get that out of my way

3059
03:47:05,530 --> 03:47:16,979
What I lost 50 and then 15. Why do we have to have five lawyers coming?

3060
03:47:17,440 --> 03:47:23,329
Like lawyer lawyer lawyer lawyer and then the bear comes and just sits in the window and gives me a high five

3061
03:47:23,329 --> 03:47:25,450
I went like this and he just ran away

3062
03:47:31,309 --> 03:47:34,000
That safe was in my house

3063
03:47:34,559 --> 03:47:36,799
Why would that ever make any sense?

3064
03:47:41,719 --> 03:47:43,280
Okay

3065
03:47:43,280 --> 03:47:44,840

3066
03:47:44,840 --> 03:47:47,760
It's dumb

3067
03:47:47,760 --> 03:47:51,319
Bits in the window. How would he have gotten in the window?

3068
03:47:51,879 --> 03:47:54,159
How much money do I have left? How much money's left in the bank?

3069
03:47:54,799 --> 03:48:02,610
We're good. We're good. We're good. Don't go that way

3070
03:48:03,959 --> 03:48:14,680
Wait, I want to see you. Hold on. Let me take the safe

3071
03:48:15,879 --> 03:48:24,120
No, never mind. You know what? I don't feel like doing that. I feel like watching television

3072
03:48:24,579 --> 03:48:29,700

Look, I was gonna say sorry and keeping promises

3442
04:36:44,740 --> 04:36:47,220
I just want to say i'm sorry about everything that happened

3443
04:36:47,380 --> 04:36:50,500
I didn't expect you to come over today because I called two people over

3444
04:36:50,819 --> 04:36:55,540
But in this university called two people over then 10 people come over so you didn't want me to come today

3445
04:36:55,779 --> 04:36:58,979
I thought you were gonna apologize. I mean I did but it was a mistake that i'm here

3446
04:36:59,139 --> 04:37:04,900
But the in the way in the way this like game works when you call someone over 30 people show up

3447
04:37:05,299 --> 04:37:07,700
This isn't a game to me death's got a pizza if you want some

3448
04:37:10,340 --> 04:37:17,150
You think I want something from him, how about you two make more pizza together

3449
04:37:18,430 --> 04:37:19,950
Okay

3450
04:37:19,950 --> 04:37:24,830
Just enjoy the house. Enjoy the play. If it's what's the money about? It's about a party. This is stereo system. Who brought that?

3451
04:37:25,790 --> 04:37:32,340
Let me get some tunes. I'm gonna walk around and see what you've done to the place. I just there's no cd in here

3452

Okay, cool

3456
04:37:49,819 --> 04:37:52,580
Well, it looks like everybody's here

3457
04:37:52,979 --> 04:37:55,459
Which is weird because I actually invited over one person

3458
04:37:56,819 --> 04:38:03,009
It's actually kind of fun

3459
04:38:03,009 --> 04:38:07,310
What is the bear and gorilla doing here? That's what I want to know. Hi. How are you?

Please don't do that. That's a that's toilet paper. I have to pay for that

3462
04:38:17,680 --> 04:38:19,360
That's expensive

3463

04:40:46,220 --> 04:40:48,220

Good time with the party, you know, um, this is good shit

3502
04:40:59,180 --> 04:41:01,180
Any dirt on him so I can get back

04:41:10,139 --> 04:41:13,020
I got it. It's like a maid. I got it. I actually got it

3504
04:41:13,819 --> 04:41:15,819
It came down

3505
04:41:16,880 --> 04:41:18,880
Hey

3506
04:41:23,279 --> 04:41:30,270
Yes, it was take a look I got it down look see we were trying to do it for less than four hours

3507
04:41:31,950 --> 04:41:34,639
Great

3508
04:41:35,919 --> 04:41:40,479
No, go ahead go by that's fine. All right, I'm gonna get help cleaning up, right?

3509
04:41:45,939 --> 04:41:51,700
Yes, uh, that's great they've been here for a few times downstairs if you could that'd be great

3510
04:41:55,709 --> 04:42:01,069
Yeah down here is good

3511
04:42:01,069 --> 04:42:03,069
Down here is good. Just make your way over here

3512
04:42:05,310 --> 04:42:08,590
I got this beers in the fridge. There's uh, I might need that

3513
04:42:08,750 --> 04:42:12,209
Hey

3514
04:42:12,590 --> 04:42:14,029
Hey, hey guys

3515
04:42:14,029 --> 04:42:16,590
Um, nothing. I was just talking to my lawyer friend

3516
04:42:17,310 --> 04:42:19,310
And he had some interesting information. Uh

3517
04:42:20,110 --> 04:42:22,750
If you wouldn't mind this is the lawyer about what?

3518
04:42:24,110 --> 04:42:28,909
Just just some interesting things about this house of yours. What's what's wrong with it?

3519
04:42:31,069 --> 04:42:34,590
I don't feel comfortable. I'm not a lawyer. What's the party? We're having a good time

3520
04:42:34,990 --> 04:42:39,069
Yeah, looking at the county records and looking at the property maps and things

3521
04:42:39,150 --> 04:42:41,310
Apparently this house was built on

3522
04:42:42,270 --> 04:42:44,029
Somebody else's property

3523
04:42:44,029 --> 04:42:49,869
Maybe somebody built on somebody else's property somebody else owns this property that this house has been built on

3524
04:42:50,189 --> 04:42:52,669
Somebody owns this. Okay. Yeah, so technically

3525
04:42:54,110 --> 04:42:56,110
It's probably

3526
04:42:56,270 --> 04:42:58,270
Their house their property

3527
04:42:58,750 --> 04:43:03,150
How is that even humanly possible? I've built that this was a house that was built

3528
04:43:04,029 --> 04:43:07,389
These are the county records that i've obtained. Well, how long have you lived here?

3529
04:43:08,029 --> 04:43:13,869
A two three weeks not very long. Not very long. You're nine eight five. Yeah, because I heard someone lived at nine eight three

3530
04:43:16,270 --> 04:43:17,950
Okay

3531
04:43:17,950 --> 04:43:19,950
Germo, what do you mean? Nine eight three

3532
04:43:20,669 --> 04:43:22,349
Oh, what?

3533
04:43:22,349 --> 04:43:24,029
I'm ludwig

3534
04:43:24,029 --> 04:43:25,389
What the fuck?

3535
04:43:25,389 --> 04:43:28,509
Yes, no, you're not this entire time. Well

3536
04:43:29,549 --> 04:43:34,349
You've been no no no no no, we're talking the land you built on is nine eight five

3537
04:43:34,349 --> 04:43:37,729
And maybe I passed an eye this whole time to your discrepancies

3538
04:43:38,349 --> 04:43:41,389
What are you talking about? No, but after I walked in on

3539
04:43:42,270 --> 04:43:43,869
Oh gosh

3540
04:43:43,869 --> 04:43:45,950
After I walked in on you and that cretin

3541
04:43:47,150 --> 04:43:49,150
He's gonna be okay

3542
04:43:49,470 --> 04:43:54,509
Well, I think he'll be fine. It's not like he could kill himself. I don't wait. Wait, wait, come over here. I need to talk to you

3543
04:43:55,389 --> 04:43:57,389
Show him the deed show me the deed. What are you talking about?

3544
04:43:57,470 --> 04:44:02,750
I this house has been built. I didn't whose name does it say there whose house doesn't say it says nine eight three

3545
04:44:02,830 --> 04:44:06,430
I've been building i'm in i'm in ludwig's back yard

3546
04:44:07,150 --> 04:44:10,669
Of nine eight three. This is nine eight five does not exist. This is an official document

3547
04:44:11,229 --> 04:44:12,509
It's accurate

3548
04:44:12,509 --> 04:44:17,950
Well, how does it make any sense? You've been emilia you built on my land without asking and I passed a blind eye

3549
04:44:18,029 --> 04:44:20,430
Because I liked you and I thought we'd get along great

3550
04:44:20,830 --> 04:44:23,869
What are you talking about? I was supposed to I was supposed to deal with this. What are you talking about?

3551
04:44:24,509 --> 04:44:27,869
Can deal with it pretty simply deal with it pretty simply. It's called you get out get out of the house

3552
04:44:27,950 --> 04:44:31,470
It's how about you get out of my house. No, you get out of my house. How's your house?

3553
04:44:31,470 --> 04:44:34,590
Look at this paper. That's really nothing. That's not actually

3554
04:44:35,310 --> 04:44:41,069
That is a legal document and ludwig owns the property and what the fuck are you talking about?

3555
04:44:41,630 --> 04:44:46,669
So you just got invited over as a party. You're my friend. The law is the law and the law is the law

3556
04:44:46,750 --> 04:44:49,790
No, it's not this doesn't make any sense. How about you get the fuck out of my house?

3557
04:44:50,669 --> 04:44:53,709
You don't own this house. I own this land

3558
04:44:54,110 --> 04:45:00,830
985 dollhouse way I was having a party and I invited everybody actually invited two people

3559
04:45:00,830 --> 04:45:03,950
But you all showed up because everybody this day. Well, I thought you wanted to hang out with me

3560
04:45:03,950 --> 04:45:07,950
Maybe apologize everybody this day. We're just cracked apparently and everyone's on drugs

3561
04:45:08,029 --> 04:45:10,509
First thing you said to me when I walked in is you didn't clean the house enough

3562
04:45:11,069 --> 04:45:14,189
I didn't even know you were ludwig and then you took the mask off. Does that matter?

3563
04:45:14,590 --> 04:45:19,709
Does that mean you need to treat me with respect if i'm ludwig? Okay. Uh, it's great sounds great

3564
04:45:19,869 --> 04:45:25,709
I I can represent impossible for me to that makes no sense. Don't log into my account. Don't stream on that account either

3565
04:45:26,909 --> 04:45:28,750
Come on, let's go discuss this

3566
04:45:28,750 --> 04:45:34,509
No, I'm ready to evict me. I'm kicking them out of this. No one's evicting me. This is my property. I live here

3567
04:45:35,229 --> 04:45:37,229
Is the sheriff evicting me?

3568
04:45:37,310 --> 04:45:38,590
Hey

3569
04:45:38,590 --> 04:45:41,470
I need your help. Ludwig. Don't let him stream on my account, please

3570
04:45:42,110 --> 04:45:44,430
I'm not worried about him streaming on your account. Follow me

3571
04:45:45,150 --> 04:45:48,669
I got the info. Hey, can you help me? I need some muscle. Where's the sheriff? Can you represent?

Yeah kitchen. Yeah your kitchen

04:46:03,500 --> 04:46:05,500
Oh now you feel bad

3576
04:46:05,740 --> 04:46:09,340
It's my house. It's not even your house. It's my house. You built on my property

3577
04:46:09,419 --> 04:46:11,419
Maybe if you treated me nicer this wouldn't happen this way

3578
04:46:13,020 --> 04:46:18,060
I don't even know your name. Oh, there's the sheriff. What do you mean the sheriff? Get off me. Where's my bear friend?

3579
04:46:18,060 --> 04:46:20,060
He's the only person I like here. Well, he's

3580
04:46:20,779 --> 04:46:24,939
Hopefully not here. Oh, that should be officer right now. Thank you. It's my door. I'll take it. Yeah

3581
04:46:26,060 --> 04:46:30,060
Oh sheriff, what are you doing? I'm trying to help. I'm hey, but we gotta follow

3582
04:46:30,619 --> 04:46:36,139
You gotta follow the world. Okay, you got like he's trespassing. What's going on here? He's trespassing and I want him out of my house

3583
04:46:36,860 --> 04:46:38,860
This guy right here

3584
04:46:42,779 --> 04:46:47,500
That is a legal document I obtained from for well, what do you think it says? Okay. I mean it says you

3585
04:46:47,740 --> 04:46:53,180

3586
04:46:53,900 --> 04:46:55,900
It's all legal. Listen, it's

3587
04:47:03,740 --> 04:47:05,740
That's right bear book him too

3588
04:47:12,380 --> 04:47:14,380
Fine i'll go fine

3589
04:47:17,500 --> 04:47:19,500
Can you can you rep for me and just say

3590
04:47:31,580 --> 04:47:34,860
That's a great part it's a good time. Hey, welcome to ludwig's dollhouse

3591
04:47:37,540 --> 04:47:39,540
Sorry if that hurt

3592
04:47:40,180 --> 04:47:42,720
Are you spiking the punch?

3593
04:47:42,720 --> 04:47:43,759
All right

3594
04:47:43,759 --> 04:47:49,250
You're just gonna leave after spike

3595
04:47:49,250 --> 04:47:53,409
Thank god. I'm a maid

3596
04:47:53,409 --> 04:48:11,810
All right my house now, what does it smell like cigar smoke what the zuck happened here

3597
04:48:14,849 --> 04:48:27,310
Oh, it's terrible

3598
04:48:27,310 --> 04:48:29,790
Should I call my own maid or am I my own maid?

3599
04:48:30,590 --> 04:48:32,270
Why is there?

3600
04:48:32,270 --> 04:48:37,970
Okay, I imagine that doesn't belong there

3601
04:48:40,099 --> 04:48:43,299
All right. I'll ignore that

3602
04:48:43,299 --> 04:48:45,299
Still smells like cigar smoke

3603
04:49:00,979 --> 04:49:04,880
God, I can't clean this

3604
04:49:05,599 --> 04:49:07,599
How do you even begin to clean this?

3605
04:49:08,720 --> 04:49:13,439
There's no trash can for giant drywall

3606
04:49:21,790 --> 04:49:23,790
That was covering the paint, okay

3607
04:49:25,409 --> 04:49:26,689
right

3608
04:49:26,689 --> 04:49:29,180
Clean that back up

3609
04:49:29,180 --> 04:49:32,939
I think the posters are sold out, but we could maybe sell that one and i'll take that cut

3610
04:49:33,819 --> 04:49:42,270
Oh fresh baked cookies

3611
04:49:46,299 --> 04:49:47,919
Well, that's ugly

3612
04:49:47,919 --> 04:49:54,259
Ooh

3613
04:49:54,259 --> 04:49:56,259
This is a fashionable robe

3614
04:50:02,580 --> 04:50:16,529
Okay, it's really wet

3615
04:50:19,139 --> 04:50:24,189
Okay, that's kind of gross

3616
04:50:27,169 --> 04:50:29,169
Well, that's kind of gross

3617
04:50:29,490 --> 04:50:31,979
I'll just take the cookies and be gone

3618
04:50:37,180 --> 04:50:43,090
Having less autonomy is just a living hell. Oh now I get to make the bed. Okay, that makes a lot of sense

3619
04:50:44,209 --> 04:50:46,209
Clean and make bed should be symbiotic

3620
04:50:47,490 --> 04:50:53,169
Do I have to make the piss bed or can I sleep on the children's bed?

3621
04:50:53,810 --> 04:51:01,139
You know what the worst kind of people are the people who buy sequin pillows

3622
04:51:01,779 --> 04:51:03,139
And do this

3623
04:51:03,139 --> 04:51:06,259
Like what do you think you are houdini? It's just a pillow relax

3624
04:51:09,599 --> 04:51:10,560
Oh

3625
04:51:10,560 --> 04:51:31,009
What does he even do all day? I'm not gonna bother with this room

3626
04:51:34,659 --> 04:51:37,139
Germa must still be home. I should kick him out

3627
04:51:50,299 --> 04:51:54,189
Oh god

3628
04:51:54,189 --> 04:51:57,970
Smells like shit in here

3629
04:51:58,049 --> 04:52:01,310
Right. That's

3630
04:52:01,310 --> 04:52:03,310
That was the laugh track moment

3631
04:52:04,669 --> 04:52:06,430
Maybe he had some

3632
04:52:06,430 --> 04:52:08,400
It's a little late

3633
04:52:08,400 --> 04:52:10,400
Shower time. Okay

3634
04:52:11,470 --> 04:52:13,470
Uh, how would I do this? Let's just

3635
04:52:22,860 --> 04:52:24,860
You know, this is not my first time doing this live

3636
04:52:25,340 --> 04:52:30,849
Okay, no peeping toms

3637
04:52:30,849 --> 04:52:37,759
You know what the worst thing you can do in a shower is?

3638
04:52:39,360 --> 04:52:40,959
Piss or shit in it

3639
04:52:40,959 --> 04:52:43,139
It's like other people might use it

3640
04:52:44,700 --> 04:52:46,700
You know, i'll do it sometimes but

3641
04:52:47,180 --> 04:52:49,180
It's still pretty deplorable of me

3642
04:52:50,240 --> 04:52:52,319
You know nothing wrong with pissing as long as you don't shit

3643
04:52:54,080 --> 04:52:57,840
All right, that's that's enough shower. That should be I feel clean enough

3644
04:52:57,840 --> 04:52:59,840
Yes

3645
04:53:02,740 --> 04:53:09,790
There it is

3646
04:53:09,790 --> 04:53:12,430
Is there another maid service in this town or am I the only maid?

3647
04:53:13,580 --> 04:53:15,580
Why are there so many stools?

3648
04:53:23,470 --> 04:53:26,029
Okay, uh

3649
04:53:37,500 --> 04:53:40,220
What was the point of kicking out germa? I have two houses now

3650
04:53:41,439 --> 04:53:44,319
I could have just charged him rent

3651
04:53:44,319 --> 04:53:46,720
I mean at the end of the day all he asked me to do was just

3652
04:53:50,139 --> 04:53:51,580
Go on one date

3653
04:53:51,580 --> 04:53:53,580
Sounded like we were dating

3654
04:53:57,470 --> 04:54:03,659
And he deserved it

3655
04:54:04,900 --> 04:54:06,659
It's gonna be tiring

3656
04:54:06,659 --> 04:54:08,540
You know if someone

3657
04:54:08,540 --> 04:54:10,139
Really wanted to

3658
04:54:10,139 --> 04:54:13,340
They could have me take a nice bed

3659
04:54:14,799 --> 04:54:19,439
I've seen how you make germa act. You don't have to act the same with me. We can have a good relationship, you know

3660
04:54:20,319 --> 04:54:24,080
Actually follow through with love stories and not just burn them to the ground by having sex with death

3661
04:54:27,900 --> 04:54:29,900
Just an option, I guess

3662
04:54:38,610 --> 04:54:48,459
What's the point of parties it's too many people to even have a conversation with every conversation's dull shit

3663
04:54:49,419 --> 04:54:51,900
Seven people told me they're gonna go to japan but covet hit

3664
04:54:53,150 --> 04:55:00,080
I don't give a shit

3665
04:55:00,080 --> 04:55:09,459
Oh, maybe I should call him back sometime. I'm tired go jogging

3666
04:55:10,459 --> 04:55:13,069
Go jog

3667
04:55:13,069 --> 04:55:15,069
So it doesn't matter who's in the titular role

3668
04:55:15,650 --> 04:55:18,770
People said oh no, it's just because it's germa that we treat him poorly

3669
04:55:20,259 --> 04:55:23,939
But perhaps really you just treat everyone poorly who comes into this room

3670
04:55:26,500 --> 04:55:29,779
Even given the pope you'd probably still make him go jogging as he's fatigued

3671
04:55:32,720 --> 04:55:35,020
Who do you treat nicely?

3672
04:55:35,500 --> 04:55:37,709
Oh

3673
04:55:37,709 --> 04:55:39,150
Jogging

3674
04:55:39,150 --> 04:55:44,290
Oh, hello. Are you doing jumping jackson cigar smoke? Is someone ready to get fit?

3675
04:55:45,330 --> 04:55:48,849
Are you ready to go for a run? Let's jog together. Okay, let's go. Come on

3676
04:55:49,569 --> 04:55:52,049
Hi, knee get him up. Okay. There we go

3677
04:55:52,689 --> 04:55:56,610
We're yummy mummies. Okay, we're yummy mummies. Aren't we turn around? Can we turn around? I'm a bit

3678
04:55:57,250 --> 04:56:00,930
A bit tired here already. I'm just a bit tired. Okay, let's do a cool down. Come on

3679
04:56:01,409 --> 04:56:05,889
Maybe a cool down looking great. Thank you. Let's go. These are high yummy mummies. These are high

3680
04:56:07,009 --> 04:56:09,009
Tommies, aren't we? Oh

3681
05:02:52,689 --> 05:02:56,060
Yeah christmas

3682
05:02:57,659 --> 05:02:59,599
This is amazing

3683
05:02:59,599 --> 05:03:01,970
Is it even christmas time?

3684
05:03:03,900 --> 05:03:05,979
hasn't even been much colder, but

3685
05:03:07,119 --> 05:03:10,880
This is great

3686
05:03:10,880 --> 05:03:21,200
Wow, that doesn't seem festive, but maybe for birthdays

3687
05:03:22,290 --> 05:03:24,290
Why are there so many cigars?

3688
05:03:31,069 --> 05:03:44,340
Now wait a second it feels as though it's a bit short maybe for the previous tenant make sense

3689
05:03:47,200 --> 05:03:51,740
Go back outside. Go back outside. Okay. Good garden the flowers

3690
05:03:52,619 --> 05:03:55,700
I feel like I've spent a lot of time in here

3691
05:03:56,669 --> 05:03:58,979
the flowers

3692
05:03:58,979 --> 05:04:01,090
these flowers

3693
05:04:01,090 --> 05:04:03,099
garden, okay

3694
05:04:03,099 --> 05:04:05,099
They need rich nutrients

3695
05:04:08,529 --> 05:04:10,529
And maybe some water

3696
05:04:13,299 --> 05:04:19,220
Oh, hey, how are you i'm looking for uh, was it jeremiah or uh, what was his name sherma?

3697
05:04:19,299 --> 05:04:22,979
What well, what do you have there? Well, listen, I felt kind of bad the other day

3698
05:04:22,979 --> 05:04:26,580
We had a little bit of a run around about something. I wanted to give him 100 bucks, you know

3699
05:04:26,979 --> 05:04:32,340
Oh, you seem really nice. Did you nice to meet you. Well, you know what? Um

3700
05:04:33,139 --> 05:04:36,580
He just left. Okay, but he said you'd stop by yeah

3701
05:04:36,900 --> 05:04:41,299
I want you to know I think I really like what you did with the place out here. It looks real nice

3702
05:04:41,380 --> 05:04:43,380
Thank you you picked that yourself

3703
05:04:43,779 --> 05:04:47,139
Yeah, I would have gone taller, but you know, how about you come in? Okay, how about you come in?

3704
05:04:47,220 --> 05:04:50,020
I mean I didn't want to stay long. Yeah, so you own the house now

3705
05:04:50,180 --> 05:04:54,020
Uh, you know what? Yeah, I I own it but he comes in and out so, you know

3706
05:04:54,020 --> 05:04:57,380
I'll just hold on to it for you. I mean listen, I was gonna give him 100 bucks

3707
05:04:58,659 --> 05:04:59,700
and um

3708
05:04:59,700 --> 05:05:01,700
Listen, i'll give you you know

3709
05:05:03,939 --> 05:05:05,619
You know

3710
05:05:05,619 --> 05:05:07,139
camo

3711
05:05:07,139 --> 05:05:10,340
It doesn't really work on you because you stick out like a sore thumb with that

3712
05:05:10,979 --> 05:05:16,819
Okay, beautiful body of yours. I really appreciate other clothing. I am married. Okay married to the game

3713
05:05:16,979 --> 05:05:20,819
I am married. So i'm physically married. I'm just going to i'm gonna give that to you

3714
05:05:21,700 --> 05:05:26,340
All right, i'll give that to you. Well, hey, if you ever don't tell nobody i said that, you know

3715
05:05:27,380 --> 05:05:29,380
Yeah, if you're ever interested

3716
05:05:30,180 --> 05:05:31,459
985

3717
05:05:31,459 --> 05:05:37,860
985 and 983. I actually own both. Okay. Yeah, I love what you did with the place. Thank you. You look great. Yeah

3718
05:05:38,659 --> 05:05:39,860
Legal dispute

3719
05:05:39,860 --> 05:05:45,860
Anytime you need electricity anytime you need electricity, there's an extension cord already and I can just use it. It's yours. Okay

3720
05:05:46,419 --> 05:05:47,860
That's convenient

3721
05:05:47,860 --> 05:05:49,860
I feel like it'd be a huge headache

3722
05:05:52,259 --> 05:05:56,349
Okay

3723
05:05:56,349 --> 05:05:58,830
Pee pee poo poo or eat eat we gotta pick one

3724
05:05:59,630 --> 05:06:02,990
Because right now it's uh, well, it's a little all over the wall

3725
05:06:09,419 --> 05:06:11,659
It seems gross, but they kind of look appealing

3726
05:06:17,520 --> 05:06:20,959
Oh, i'll clean yeah, i'll just this seems to be somewhat

3727
05:06:21,740 --> 05:06:25,680
Stereotypical feels like we could have respected maybe the job more and

3728
05:06:26,639 --> 05:06:28,639
and been like, oh maybe that's that's

3729
05:06:28,959 --> 05:06:30,959
That's what they do day to day. So perhaps

3730
05:06:31,680 --> 05:06:33,680
You know, they could take care of

3731
05:06:33,680 --> 05:06:35,680
The rest of what they got going on

3732
05:06:36,000 --> 05:06:38,799
But i'll clean i'll clean i've cleaned this place before

3733
05:06:39,840 --> 05:06:41,840
And do it again

3734
05:06:42,560 --> 05:06:43,840
Uh

3735
05:06:43,840 --> 05:06:48,159
Admittedly all the utensils were me so I can't be too upset

3736
05:06:51,580 --> 05:06:53,580
What is this small pinata?

3737
05:06:54,380 --> 05:06:57,709
Does this have actual pizza in it?

3738
05:06:59,099 --> 05:07:01,409
What?

3739
05:07:01,409 --> 05:07:03,889
Why is it so red?

3740
05:07:03,889 --> 05:07:07,250
How do you get pizza that red is it made with beets instead of tomatoes?

3741
05:07:10,159 --> 05:07:12,319
It's so it's a week old

3742
05:07:13,200 --> 05:07:15,119
Why would you put edip?

3743
05:07:15,119 --> 05:07:17,729
I would have eaten that

3744
05:07:17,729 --> 05:07:18,860
Okay

3745
05:07:18,860 --> 05:07:20,860
I get the white bread thing now

3746
05:07:26,819 --> 05:07:28,819
There's so much alcohol

3747
05:07:29,700 --> 05:07:31,619
Does he ever drink water?

3748
05:07:31,619 --> 05:07:34,180
Is there a way to drink water in this house or is it only?

3749
05:07:35,860 --> 05:07:37,860
Unmarked sodas and unmarked beers

3750
05:07:41,599 --> 05:07:43,599
Sorry, i'm not allowed to do that yet

3751
05:07:44,159 --> 05:07:47,200
But if anyone wanted to feed me that's what I would do

3752
05:07:47,919 --> 05:07:49,919
But for now i'm staying hungry

3753
05:07:50,479 --> 05:07:51,759
Had someone

3754
05:07:51,759 --> 05:07:55,360
Wanted that to happen. That's what could happen, but we'll never know

3755
05:07:59,790 --> 05:08:11,470
Well, this room's not bad then i'm anxious just being here

3756
05:08:19,459 --> 05:08:21,520
I have to work

3757
05:08:21,520 --> 05:08:23,520
Why am I being called by elvin men?

3758
05:08:24,900 --> 05:08:27,310
I'm a maid

3759
05:08:27,310 --> 05:08:30,540
Is this for the king?

3760
05:08:30,540 --> 05:08:34,060
You know, it's been a pretty long day. I had a few different things for everybody last week

3761
05:08:34,139 --> 05:08:38,619
I had a couple of payments that I was a little late on it's been kind of a difficult time and i'm wondering

3762
05:08:38,619 --> 05:08:42,700
I think looking for a rail. This is the only job I had this is cleaning this house. Whose house am I?

3763
05:08:45,099 --> 05:08:47,099
Oh gosh

3764
05:08:47,180 --> 05:08:49,569
Uh

3765
05:08:49,569 --> 05:08:51,569
Just on my way to work. How's it going?

3766
05:08:52,369 --> 05:08:53,889
well

3767
05:08:53,889 --> 05:08:55,889
Ludwig or Amelia works generally, but thank you

3768
05:08:56,689 --> 05:08:58,689
Good day to you, too

3769
05:09:50,209 --> 05:10:20,459
I own two houses. It doesn't make a lot of sense to go to work

3770
05:10:21,340 --> 05:10:23,580
I could just rent out a house

3771
05:10:23,979 --> 05:10:25,979
Doesn't add a lot of value to society, but

3772
05:10:26,459 --> 05:10:28,459
It's a good way to accumulate wealth

3773
05:10:32,240 --> 05:10:34,740
But nothing over 2.6 million

3774
05:10:34,979 --> 05:10:37,729
That'd be too much frankly

3775
05:10:40,049 --> 05:10:42,049
All right. Why?

3776
05:10:43,259 --> 05:10:46,020
Did I leave it open?

3777
05:10:46,020 --> 05:10:49,139
if you leave both open it kind of ruins the illusion then never mind but

3778
05:10:49,860 --> 05:10:55,939
Do people just come to my house? What?

3779
05:10:56,099 --> 05:11:02,799
Let me take off my work uniform

3780
05:11:03,759 --> 05:11:05,119
Okay, uh

3781
05:11:05,119 --> 05:11:07,119
Can we do one thing that's good for me?

3782
05:11:07,919 --> 05:11:08,959
All right

3783
05:11:08,959 --> 05:11:10,959
Shower piss eat

3784
05:11:10,959 --> 05:11:14,400
Sleep, I think all of them would be pretty pretty helpful right now

3785
05:11:18,610 --> 05:11:23,169
Play outside. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. No, I have to piss. Oh, yeah play outside

3786
05:11:26,659 --> 05:11:30,779
Hey

3787
05:11:30,779 --> 05:11:34,590
Whoa

3788
05:11:34,590 --> 05:11:36,959
Does this get us in trouble?

3789
05:11:49,389 --> 05:11:58,779
Oh, it's fun good performance

3790
05:12:06,049 --> 05:12:08,049
Can I can I do something good for me?

3791
05:12:09,180 --> 05:12:10,779
I don't want to be outside

3792
05:12:10,779 --> 05:12:20,479
I'll just i'll hover near things that I would like to do and maybe maybe

3793
05:12:21,119 --> 05:12:23,119
You know, it's like a hint

3794
05:12:31,810 --> 05:12:37,700
Didn't close the legs bed didn't mean to do that. It's more

3795
05:12:39,169 --> 05:12:42,740
looting

3796
05:12:42,740 --> 05:12:45,060
Okay, there's already a lot of piss in the bed

3797
05:12:47,009 --> 05:12:48,369
oh

3798
05:12:48,369 --> 05:12:58,369
I feel like having a bedroom through a room with a reciprocating saw and a sledge hammer

3799
05:12:58,930 --> 05:13:03,729
And a knife that is far too sharp and a bunch of broken drywall isn't the safest way to

3800
05:13:04,849 --> 05:13:10,029
live life

3801
05:13:10,029 --> 05:13:12,459
Wow, look at this

3802
05:13:12,459 --> 05:13:14,459
Maybe still available. I don't know

3803
05:13:14,540 --> 05:13:30,319
All right

3804
05:21:03,709 --> 05:21:05,709
What are you doing in my house

3805
05:21:10,529 --> 05:21:14,369
You're gifting me cookies

3806
05:21:14,369 --> 05:21:20,259
No, okay

3807
05:21:20,259 --> 05:21:21,779
Stop gifting me

3808
05:21:21,779 --> 05:21:33,979
Okay, you didn't trap us in here

3809
05:21:40,319 --> 05:21:41,759
You sit on the stool

3810
05:21:41,759 --> 05:21:51,150
What are you doing in my home?

3811
05:21:52,319 --> 05:21:54,319
Oh, yeah

3812
05:21:55,360 --> 05:22:00,349
Of course, it's you

3813
05:22:01,950 --> 05:22:03,950
You couldn't even be a proper man

3814
05:22:04,509 --> 05:22:06,509
a shadow boxer

3815
05:22:06,900 --> 05:22:09,540
You know how hard it was to get involved in that group

3816
05:22:10,259 --> 05:22:14,020
Was it like their auditions? What do you know? And just hold on a second delete the same

3817
05:22:14,659 --> 05:22:18,500
Delete this the same file. You need to delete it. We're gonna start over what's delete the save file

3818
05:22:18,500 --> 05:22:21,139
We're gonna start from a new house. Delete the save if you could

3819
05:22:22,020 --> 05:22:23,939
Delete save file

3820
05:22:23,939 --> 05:22:24,900
Oh

3821
05:22:24,900 --> 05:22:29,540
Delete the save delete it right now. We're gonna start over. I can't do this anymore. You can't only be in my house

3822
05:22:30,180 --> 05:22:32,430
Not gonna happen

3823
05:22:32,430 --> 05:22:33,869
