1
00:00:06,459 --> 00:00:25,879
So I just walk around the beach? Oh nice, this is a pretty good beach party. What's that guy doing?

2
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:35,399
Somebody's over there using like a hand glider. There's like jet skis. Is this open world? What

3
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:45,109
do I want to do first? There's so many options in M&M's Beach Party. Nice. Good job. Good return.

4
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:56,340
Excellent return. There we go. Set it up for you. What the fuck are you doing? Why do we both suck

5
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:06,150
so bad? Can we get at least a volley going on? My god. Somebody please make a return. Hit it up.

6
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:12,870
Spike it down. Thank you very much. I'll take that point. Apparently we didn't get the point,

7
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:20,040
but it's okay. I'll just miss over and fucking over again. Okay, hold on. Please seriously hit

8
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,299
the fucking ball. There we go. Oh my god, how do you control how hard you hit it?

9
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:30,599
Is there any way to control it? I don't think so judging by the fact that nobody can seem to

10
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:41,290
make a good serve. I don't think it's possible. Do it. Flick the fucking potato frog thing,

11
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:50,099
whatever the hell this thing is. All right, I got two points. Yeah, good. This is good fun.

12
00:01:50,739 --> 00:01:59,099
I can't wait to like to give this broken ass. What? Wait, no, it's the computer's turn?

13
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:07,109
The computer's like worse than I am. Wait, how come he's getting all these points? Look at his

14
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:15,990
points. I scored two. He got eight. He didn't get eight. He got like two. Why does he have

15
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:25,379
nine points right now? See, I have to spray these guys orange because I picked orange

16
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:34,659
and the other guys have to spray their guys, their colors. It's a blast. I mean, we're talking,

17
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:42,180
this is it. There's only like three different animations and you know what? Time to go try

18
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:49,699
hard mode because I'm winning one of these. Spray that guy. This guy coming down. I know he always

19
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:56,259
walks the same route. He ain't going to beat me this time. What do I need? 15. I lost again.

20
00:02:56,979 --> 00:03:06,650
I actually came in last place. I want to ride like the jet ski. Where's the canoe?

21
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:14,180
Where's the canoe? Looking at the back of the box right now. Where's the canoe?

22
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:19,219
I bought this game because the canoe was on the back and you're telling me I can't even

23
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:27,770
access the canoe right now? You got to be kidding me. Do I have to unlock this next game? I must

24
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:33,639
have to. There's got to be some reason why that's like all boarded up and if you think for one second

25
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:39,719
I'm going to like five star all the games and get like the points and shit required to open

26
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:47,939
this gate up, no way. And you know what? I got a better idea. How about we actually play a good

27
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:53,060
party game? One of the best party games ever made. You probably all know which one I'm talking

28
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:59,300
about. It's on Nintendo. It's on the Wii featuring one of the most famous video game characters ever.

29
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:09,819
I'm of course talking about Pac-Man Party. Oh yeah. Pac-Man Party. Look at the party mode.

30
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:17,420
Got mini games, rewards. You can play classic games? You kidding me? I can play Pac-Man, Galaga,

31
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:23,290
Dig Dug. This is included. This is all included. I don't have to pay extra. Come on. Are you

32
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:28,410
kidding me? I'm like pumped up right now to like eat a bunch of spaghetti. All you're going to do

33
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:33,160
is you move the hand around, roll the spaghetti. All right, let's go. Let's go you fucking punks.

34
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:41,620
It's time to eat the spaghetti. Oh am I going to win? That guy, that's no fair. That guy's got two

35
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:50,180
arms. How come that guy has two forks going in? That doesn't seem real fair. Look at that. Look

36
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:58,389
at how much I kicked everybody's ass. I'm the master of the spaghetti roll-up. How is that guy

37
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:05,579
still standing by the way? Look at the guy on the left. He has like a legitimate seven. He's got a

38
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:08,779
backwards seven and apparently it's still standing. Doesn't matter. I'm going to win.

39
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:20,889
That guy is so fucked up and he's going to beat me. No. No. Give me one more. Get out of my way.

40
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:24,329
Got to get past the line. Got to get past the line. My ice cream needs a bit. I lost.

41
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:32,040
Pizza party. Oh yeah. Pizza party. I'm going to be the master of the pieces. Master of the spaghetti.

42
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:39,459
Hey, who remembers from like the original Pac-Man games? There's a giant spider that tries to eat

43
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:46,620
and kill you. It's pretty, this is like pretty canon. Can I throw this? Can I throw this giant

44
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:57,269
like dog bone? How long does this last? I just want to, I want to go back to eating like spaghetti.

45
00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:04,420
I don't want to like fight. I want to eat ice cream, candy and spaghetti. See, this is what

46
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:12,569
I'm talking about. It's all about just eating candy and eating brownies and chocolate pudding.

47
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:20,199
No spiders. No scary monsters. It's just good old fun. That guy's picking the brownie. We don't want

48
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:28,139
to let the bomb drop on the ground and that guy you already lost. Nice job. Why would you pick that

49
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:38,730
piece? Nobody even got a turn to go. How does he win when nobody else had a turn to go? So pretty

50
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:44,730
much the moral of this story and the purpose of this video is to simply say, uh, Pac-Man is

51
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:50,949
unstoppable. He's unbeatable and he's the best video game character ever. And if you want to argue

52
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:56,860
that with me, then all I got, I got four words for you. Pac-Man is the best character ever.

53
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:02,860
You will never defeat him. He is a god among men and he is undeniably the greatest character ever

54
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,620
in the history of video. That was like 70 words, but you get the idea.
