00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:09,429
Hi guys. Throw, throw, throw, get the rocks out of here. No rocks today. It's supposed to be a

2
00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:15,910
chill out, hang out, the veg out stream. That means when you like eat a shitload of vegetables,

3
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:22,579
right? When you're a bodybuilder. You don't understand. The reason why it took me like

4
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:30,260
20 minutes or so, I got carrots, I've got tomatoes, I've got fresh, some fresh garden roots,

5
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:41,320
all sitting right here. And my coffee's still too hot to drink. I hate when that happens.

6
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:50,700
When am I going to do a cooking stream? That you'll maybe. But today we're going to do something

7
00:00:50,700 --> 00:01:07,849
a little different today. Hang out and have a little fun. We're going to just play plain. Okay.

8
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:17,659
We're going to. Yeah, that's a nice scripted joke. Because I've been doing some more intense video

9
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:23,939
games for the last three or four screens besides Viscera, but that was intense too. Not today.

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,459
We're just going to sit here like this. I'm sorry. Like this. Hi. Welcome to an in real life stream

11
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:38,709
where I sit here and drink coffee and we talk about topics. You know what I mean? I'm not going to

12
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:46,489
shave. I'm not doing it. You know, what, what, what topic are we going to talk about today?

13
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:58,250
I think we're going to talk about what's the current state of magical wizard board. What's the

14
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:10,199
current state of that game? Does it even still fucking exist? I got this free mouse pad in 2012

15
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:20,819
and I've, I've never not used another mouse pad. I'm also a little tired today. Your audio sounds

16
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:35,379
bad. Wait, we've got some fun things to try today in our IRL stream. Now that I pulled that out,

17
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:41,860
I just fucked up my whole desk though. Kenshi won the poll. I'm probably going to play Kenshi.

18
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:48,550
We need to start. I need to just relax for a little bit. Okay. Just chill out. Why do I have

19
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:55,080
villain hair? Because I just do. I have to accept it at some point that I'm just, I'm a fucking bad

20
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:01,430
guy, right? You can't be a good guy with this kind of hair drinking out of this kind of cup.

21
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:12,500
Like this, this is a bad, this is a bad guy sitting here. Uh, anyways, uh, give me one second.

22
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,129
I wanted to try something today because I have this thing. I know the audio doesn't sound very

23
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:21,689
good, but that's for very specific reasons because the voice changer is currently as you can see,

24
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:29,240
turning the fuck off. No, uh, I have a bunch of different presets here that probably sound a little

25
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:38,069
fucking strange. I want to do this a bit. This is a bit coming up. Just if you're serious.

26
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:47,030
The thing is, I don't know what this sounds like. Oh, it sounds like this. That sounds fucking

27
00:03:47,030 --> 00:04:06,069
horrible. Ow! What is this one? Hello? I don't know what this is supposed to be for. This is

28
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:14,099
called romantic Paris. I think this is just background noise. Yeah. I don't think that does

29
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:22,170
anything. Uh, but yeah, welcome. How many, how many, how many, do I have chat in the right place?

30
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:31,860
No, chat's in the wrong place today. I forgot. Dude, just do a date. Can I have two going at

31
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:42,470
once? No, we're not doing a fucking virtual date. I want to do a singing stream where I put, I was

32
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:50,180
going to get an elaborate costume. I didn't have any time though. And turn on this and sing and

33
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:56,680
like put like, like fuck up the video for a little bit and pretend like this is a real singing stream

34
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:08,540
and have people come in and yell at me that I have a like auto tune on. What is sword? Sword. I,

35
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:13,189
oh, it's because it's, it's because it's going like round round round. I get it. I get it.

36
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:26,310
The lightsaber sound. But is it really though? This is called zombie. Zombie. Same with this song.

37
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:49,319
This is not even the rap. You're layering. Let me tell you guys something. This is this kind of stream

38
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:56,899
where we talk about topics and I mean like Jesus. What's going on in the industry right now?

39
00:05:56,899 --> 00:06:04,089
You've got blizzard is acting all crazy. What the heck is that? What the heck is going on here?

40
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:16,759
I literally can't understand a single thing you're saying. Should I speak, should I speak, uh,

41
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:35,899
uh, uh, it's gonna be possible. They're layered. I'm going to try to speak from the closet as the

42
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:42,379
monster in your closet. Like they're talking about politics. I want, I'm going to get in there and

43
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:46,779
be the monster in the closet and talk, like talking about politics. We're going to have scary music.

44
00:06:46,779 --> 00:07:04,069
Hold on. Is there ambience with this one? Hold on. Let me see. What the fuck is going on? Can you

45
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:14,980
guys hear, can you hear me now? Does this sound normal? I, I, I, I should sound completely normal

46
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:28,250
now. I'm, I'm, I'm doubled. Wait. Oh, okay. Now I should sound normal. Do I sound? Here we go. Okay.

47
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:34,600
So if you didn't catch the thing I said, uh, uh, I want, I'm going to go in the closet there with

48
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,319
that voice on and just start talking about like fucking politics and be, and be like monster in

49
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:50,339
closet stream. Like sleep tight. Uh, sticks renegade just gave $50. Thank you so much sticks for the

50
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:58,860
50 bucks. And I just got to tell you, uh, thank you so much. Uh, you say, Hey German, remember that,

51
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:05,100
uh, no, I don't, I don't want that to be on. That's probably not something I should have on

52
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,980
it because this is a big fucking money donation. I don't want to like fucking mock it or anything.

53
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:14,259
You know what I mean? Uh, thank you for the $50 though, for real. Uh, Hey German, remember that

54
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:18,660
abscess surgery I had, uh, thanks to Crohn's disease. Well, I just found out the hospital

55
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:25,879
didn't destroy my wallet. Insurance saved me 98% of almost 10 grand. So since I'm not broke,

56
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:32,889
I'll give some of those savings to you for being the best content creator ever here in my heart.

57
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:39,990
Best content creator ever. I can't even thank you, man. Like that's, uh, I'm really,

58
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:45,399
really happy to hear that you didn't have to spend a shitload of money to fix something that

59
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:55,750
your body decided to do on its own. Thank you so much. Swift, Swift recovery. Thank you for the

60
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:04,789
$50 fucking dollars. The voice is crackling. It's probably because I have too much going on. Let me

61
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:14,620
test it out. Voice crackling, crackling, crackling. Is it? Probably have to mess with some settings,

62
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:20,070
but, uh, I was going to do IRL today. I'm not even paying attention to anything else that's

63
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:25,580
going on over here. Uh, cause I have, I forgot I did my title correct. I did, I did my hair like

64
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:32,200
so fast and I don't even, it doesn't even look that good and the lights are all wrong, but, um,

65
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:39,940
I wanted just to hang out today. Speaking of lights, I can brighten it up a little bit in here.

66
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:47,370
Uh, where's my mouse? Cause, I don't know, I like to do little IRL streams. Sometimes we just dick

67
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:55,259
around and do nothing. You know, it's fun. Sometimes you just want to do that and we'll

68
00:09:55,259 --> 00:10:01,289
probably end up, cause I mean, I'm not going to sit here for six hours doing this. We'll probably

69
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:14,679
end up going to Kenshi or, uh, what's the other one? I have an uneven receding hairline. No,

70
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:21,539
it's, it's pretty even. It's just over here because my hair is pushed this way. So like see,

71
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:28,740
the other hair is like, my hair is like combed this way. So it's actually like here, but it's,

72
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:38,059
it just looks that way because it's combed it that way. Simpsons 100% run. Well, hold on. First

73
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:46,809
things first, I gotta get my goddamn, I gotta check my words with friends. Onomatopoeia,

74
00:10:46,809 --> 00:11:00,299
that's a triple word score. Uh, I need to change the lights for one. Why do I give a shit if you

75
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:05,850
can see the screen or not? I don't understand. That's like not a big deal. I don't know. There's

76
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:23,500
nothing on here that's like that important. I'm like, wait a minute. Where is it? Try to change

77
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,669
this a little because this needs to be a little bit brighter. It's not bright enough for me.

78
00:11:27,669 --> 00:11:49,019
I need more brightness. I don't know. I think, okay, I, I'm going to, I'll do this in chat

79
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:54,100
because I'm going to go in there and I'm going to hang out in there and be in chat and just

80
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,539
talk. And then I'm going to, I'm going to open the fucking door in like five minutes and there

81
00:11:58,539 --> 00:12:04,120
are people that are just going to be, just pretend like I didn't start the stream yet.

82
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:12,389
Please fix the crackles. Does that fix it? Is that fixing crackles? Is it still crackling? Hey,

83
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:22,629
hey, hey, hey, yo, hey, hey, hey, hey, oh, oh, fixed. Okay. Good. So, uh, just give me a second.

84
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:26,230
Well, I'm going to, I'm going to go in the chat and just hang out for like five minutes.

85
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:39,129
So I'm just going to be in there. Let me just do like, yeah. All right. Just give me a second.

86
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:46,120
I have to go to my own stream. I forgot about that. I got like fucking weird pants on too, man.

87
00:12:46,840 --> 00:14:00,220
All right. That's enough of that. I'm done with that. Uh, that was practice for later

88
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:06,940
because I'm going to draw, I'm going to make it red. Wow. That was really funny.

89
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:17,049
I thought in my head, it played out a little funnier. Scared of the dark. No, I was just in

90
00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:23,159
there. I can't be scared of the dark. I'm just sitting in there. Uh, beer me, user name,

91
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:28,090
beer me a user name. Just gave five community subs. Thanks a lot beer.

92
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:41,019
He faced his fear. He can't stand chat that much. That's not true. That's completely untrue.

93
00:14:43,179 --> 00:14:48,860
We're still crackling. What the fuck is happening? Hold on. I'm crackling. Why would it be

94
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:58,259
crackling? Cause I'm listening to it. Hold on. Is it crackling right now? What? Like when you hear

95
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:15,080
it through here, it's not right. So what the heck is going on here? It's just, it's well,

96
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:24,740
the voice changer is on right now. You know what I mean? It's on right now. He listened to one guy.

97
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:45,529
Oh, turn up the game. I unplugged something from my neck right now. I did not. I didn't know such

98
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:56,970
thing. Did the voice change that guy driving by? Oh shit. Still on the weird one. All right. So

99
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:34,870
here's what we're going to do. I want to try this. Set it up. Uh, go. I wonder how this is actually

100
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:46,090
going to sound. Now let's get the, uh, this might be very embarrassing. I got to make sure the voice

101
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:53,179
changer is on and working as fucking intended. No, don't worry. We're going to do demon in the

102
00:16:53,179 --> 00:17:00,970
closet. We'll get, this is going to be a lot. I was just hanging out from it. It isn't already.

103
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:09,059
We can just reverse voice change it. No, you can't. Only like three people in here know how to do

104
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:19,509
that. Do you know how to do that? You know how to do that. There's people, people in here know how

105
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:32,039
to do that. I gotta be careful then. All right. So let's say I get, let's get it ambient in here.

106
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:51,559
Oh my God. It's still crackling. Here's what I'm going to do above that. Here's what's going to

107
00:17:51,559 --> 00:18:03,930
happen. Ready? Turn off. Turn this off. That sounded any better? Is it still happening?

108
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,180
Tell me if it's still happening.

109
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:13,339
Cause that, that's the only other outliers to why that would be happening.

110
00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:22,630
Cause that I had a compressor on, maybe the compressor was like, was fucking with it.

111
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:35,480
Let's, uh, still happening. Probably a loose mic now. It's nothing to do with the mic.

112
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,200
It's to do with the software pulling through. But I had this running during the Christmas

113
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,720
stream and it wasn't a problem. So I don't understand why the fuck did like 1500 people

114
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:49,400
just show up in a second. What happened? They were like 3500 people in it. It was like five,

115
00:18:49,400 --> 00:19:04,710
5,000. Did I just get braided by Dr. Phil? Nice. Got braided. Well, welcome. Hey,

116
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:12,779
welcome to the setup of the joke that's not going to pay off. Rated by Robaz. Oh,

117
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,619
fuck. Yeah. What's up? It's like two raids in a row or two streams in a row.

118
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:29,980
It's like two or 3000 people. Damn. Well, thank you. Welcome guys. Uh, what's that?

119
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,619
Oh, it's an emo. I thought like, I thought something was wrong.

120
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,579
One mod spam. Turn up your mic. I'm so scared about the crackles. Okay, here we go.

121
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:50,460
I gotta, I gotta hear these first. Has it been like this the whole time? Why has it been on this?

122
00:19:51,500 --> 00:20:11,640
That's not what I wanted. Oh my, this whole thing. Is it crackling now during this one,

123
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:19,930
this particular? Cause that would be a pain in the ass. Yes. Fuck. I don't get it.

124
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:32,009
Let me try something here real quick. Give me a second. I'm going to reboot this whole thing.

125
00:20:32,009 --> 00:20:38,410
Not the screen like this program. I'm going to mute everything. So it should not be happening now.

126
00:20:39,529 --> 00:21:02,900
Are we still, are we cracking? It shouldn't be at all. No, nothing, nothing, nothing.

127
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:07,509
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,

128
00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:17,329
right? It's because of God damn it. Okay. Hi guys. Welcome everyone to the

129
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:26,609
mic should work fucking properly because this is the mic that's actually plugged in over here.

130
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:32,930
First time singing on stream by the way. Now that that's settled, we're fine. There's no crackles.

131
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:43,420
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, V, W, X, Y, and Z, right? We're fine.

132
00:21:43,420 --> 00:22:14,720
Everything sounds good. Now. Hold on. Now. How do we sound now? I just rebooted it all.

133
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:30,670
I know it's a little quiet, but is it going cracking? That's the problem. No, no cracking,

134
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:36,829
no cracking, cracking, no cracking. I know there's a, yeah, the reverb is on because it's on this

135
00:22:36,829 --> 00:22:45,059
church one. All right. I'm ready. You ready? You ready for this? I need to have like a karaoke

136
00:22:45,059 --> 00:23:00,099
website. Let's go to, I need to make sure I know what this sounds like. A, hello? A, A, A,

137
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:21,170
A, A, A, A. This is that, that's doing it right? Sam's voice. Is it, it's no auto-tune? This should

138
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:32,180
be auto-tune on this. Is it not auto-tune? I think it should be. I was going to go with it.

139
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:50,660
So we got auto-tune, changing our voice to sound good, right? Okay, good. Now I need a karaoke,

140
00:23:50,660 --> 00:24:01,759
free karaoke website. I turned off the auto-tune because it probably sounds stupid. Hey, what's up?

141
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:14,349
It's me. So now let's go to, well, what's a good free karaoke website? Turn off the dry signal,

142
00:24:14,349 --> 00:24:27,900
leave it 100% wet. Okay. Red, uh, is this, is this a real website? What's a good karaoke website?

143
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:50,369
And don't you dare. Just YouTube it. Oh yeah. All right. Okay. How about tonight's gonna be a good

144
00:24:50,369 --> 00:25:05,220
night karaoke? I think that sounds pretty good. I got my auto-tune on the tonight's gonna be a

145
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:12,269
good night karaoke. They always sound so shitty too. It's always like somebody did it on a Casio

00:25:12,269 --> 00:25:44,690
keyboard. Okay. Here we go. I can see it. You ready? I'm going to see some, here we go.

148
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:30,500
that tonight's gonna be a good, good night. Does that sound good? That tonight. Hello?

149
00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:57,180
Come on. So this is not, uh, this is not an auto-tune. Right. That makes sense. Okay.

150
00:26:57,259 --> 00:27:10,299
That's wrong. So, uh, all right. I can find the auto-tune. Hello. Hello. Hello. You can always

151
00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:23,230

rip through these octaves. Ready? This is auto-tune. It has to be. I'm ready. And in three, two, one,

00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:46,609
Oh, god damn it the fucking voice changer. All right, so

3,000 people that came in the raid. Oh

Give me a break

207
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:52,300
It's the whole thing's crashed out. I guess this did this webcam just die. I think the webcam just died

208
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:54,929
This thing's brand new

209
00:34:54,929 --> 00:35:02,429
Hold on. I gotta like read I could have you gotta be kidding me

210
00:35:02,989 --> 00:35:14,099
What broke it because I changed the white balance. That's a lot of bullshit. Oh, yeah, I don't even know this thing's plugged in

211
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:16,860
I gotta like unplug it. I might this is gonna like crash the whole stream

212
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,460
This is not good

213
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:26,900
What the hell what I was just getting started with like the oh

214
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:37,480
This is not good. All right, I'm gonna try to rip it out because it's no. What are you doing?

215
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:49,280
Use the mic as a webcam. What does that even mean?

216
00:35:50,019 --> 00:35:54,340
Use my microphone as a webcam

217
00:35:56,889 --> 00:35:59,349
What I'm so confused

218
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:05,940
Hold on. All right. Everybody say it fucking Hail Mary because I'm ripping the cord out

219
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:22,980
Let's see if it happened. We good. Am I still live? I'm good, right? I think we're good

220
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:44,840
We're good. What happened to the camera?

221
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:57,570
Am I still alive and I mean that it work land physically. It looks like a thermal camera now

222
00:36:57,929 --> 00:37:07,619
This thing's broken. All right, what the fuck are we doing? Oh, yeah, I was gonna get in that closet and say a bunch of bullshit

223
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:22,539
Yeah, hello. Yeah, good. No now something's really fucked up. All right, so I got yeah

224
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:31,050
I got three monitors one two three. All right, so let's do a straw poll because I want I'm curious at what you guys think

225
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:55,019
Here you go, please vote if you haven't if you have even if you have it has not been even one one

227
00:37:57,219 --> 00:38:00,139
All right. So what do you guys want me to do? What are you looking for today? No, I

228
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:26,019
Was I wanted to see how badly this was gonna lose. What is monster discussion? Well, I don't I haven't figured that out yet

229
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:30,250
Can I vote for neither? Yeah

230
00:38:30,929 --> 00:38:32,130
Just go like this

231
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:34,880
Oh already really I

232
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:37,699
Didn't do anything yet

233
00:38:37,900 --> 00:39:11,559
Okay. So what do you what are we looking out here? That's a fantastic cup. It was a gift. It was a gift from my girlfriend

234
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:16,480
I don't know. I noticed you got it at some store. Probably get it on

235
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,099
Probably get on an Amazon if I were to guess maybe

236
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:28,989
Alright, so it looks like I wanted to see how badly karaoke was gonna get destroyed and didn't really get destroyed that badly

237
00:39:28,989 --> 00:39:30,989
Which is kind of a shock

238
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:37,059
that clip that clip of me got will go around and it'll be like

239
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:41,570
What an embarrassment, but I know it will

240
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:47,210
And I'm gonna be lying there in bed just with my fucking iPad looking at clips of like good night

241
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:49,409
No, I'm gonna be like, oh fuck me. What have I done myself?

242
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:54,059
alright, so let's uh, let's go ahead and

243
00:39:54,980 --> 00:40:06,969
Get some scary music. I'm gonna turn the light down. I don't know why I was going that high

244
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:15,280
Okay. So here we go. I got a loop this

245
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:24,309
This is

246
00:40:24,309 --> 00:40:31,269
Why my computer is fucked up. Did I like sing so poorly and with a fucking voice changer on that it broke the computer

247
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:41,860
Let's see how this one sounds. That's pretty good

248
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:52,519
Now I'm gonna drop the light a lot and then I'm gonna have a light in the closet and I don't even know if you're gonna

249
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:54,000
Be able to hear me

250
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:04,619
The last time I fucked with the light on this thing. We had a huge problem

251
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:25,780
That's fine. A little more. That looks good. That looks good. That looks weird

252
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:33,599
Like my my lips never let my lips this big and red

253
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:42,920
Holy shit. This is not sweat on my shoulders. You can't do that one to me. Don't do me like this. That's not sweat

254
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,960
That's a light casting. I look like

255
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,760
No, it's my beard I

256
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,340
Look pretty fucking evil. All right, you ready?

257
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:59,260
This is gonna be awful this whole don't worry that let me let me like keep doing awful shit

258
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:04,820
So you forget how awful the karaoke portion of this stream was and that wasn't even karaoke it was just a joke

259
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:11,579
But forget it. Let's keep doing terrible shit. So like well look when there's like ten terrible bits in a row

260
00:42:12,099 --> 00:42:15,860
What I what was the worst one? I don't remember what he what was the first one he did

261
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,340
Oh, he did like the carry. Well, that was other one

262
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:23,460
That one he like fucking went outside his window and screamed. I was fucking stupid too. All right, let's go

263
00:42:39,579 --> 00:42:41,579
About the good climate

264
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:58,389
Monsters are real that's the tagline for this one

265
00:44:10,219 --> 00:44:12,219
Oh

266
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:14,820
Oh

267
00:46:04,539 --> 00:46:20,519
Was I incomprehensible we didn't hear anything no, just give me a clip

268
00:46:21,239 --> 00:46:23,739
Show it to me I

269
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:26,019
Said some fucking good shit during that

270
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:46,280
Really? Oh god. Damn it. Oh, well, we got the gist of it. All right, can I turn off like the I'm gonna go back into here

271
00:46:46,519 --> 00:47:03,420
All I heard is something about monsters being real. This is so fucked up. There we go. That looks that's better

272
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:06,789
Why does turning the brightness down fuck the whole thing up?

273
00:47:07,469 --> 00:47:15,199
Something about the closet being too small. Yeah

274
00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:20,699
That was part of it. I

275
00:47:20,699 --> 00:47:29,070
Heard the word monsters ink. Yeah, I got my photos developing back there. That's what's over there. I

276
00:47:36,809 --> 00:47:38,969
Heard don't call the police

277
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:54,019
anyways

278
00:47:54,019 --> 00:47:56,260
So right now here's the funny story about that

279
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:03,030
Right there right there. I mean like I mean literally right there is

280
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:10,610
Probably where Kim's head is where she's lying down right now on the other side of that closet wall

281
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:13,050
so

282
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:15,030
She's probably just like

283
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:24,420
What the fuck is going on in that room? No, like she's on the other side of the she's on the other side of the wall

284
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:27,460
She's not in there. Look, you know what's in here

285
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:50,429
Oh

286
00:49:41,329 --> 00:49:57,389
Eat your ass as a necklace. No, that's not what I said. All right, so

287
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:02,260
Have I been I've been sitting here for 51 minutes

288
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:08,619
It's been I felt like it's been like three

289
00:50:31,139 --> 00:50:40,739
That doesn't even sound scary that sounds that sounds like shit

290
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:55,880
German shitting himself right now. No, I'm fine. All right, so we had our fun in IRL

291
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:15,530
You can see my face I

292
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:21,179
like my like human

293
00:51:21,179 --> 00:51:30,449
Like boy face is just sitting right there. Like I said, we're gonna do I'm gonna change this from sitting around

294
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:39,900
Well knock not yet. Hold on. They cancel that not quite yet

295
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:58,340
All right. We're gonna do one more thing. What the hell is it?

296
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:16,309
There's also this one too

297
00:52:27,539 --> 00:52:32,219
This just this just sounds like somebody punched me right here

298
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:40,059
Sounds like I'm something stuck in my throat. This is the chad voice

299
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:44,800
Yeah, I mean might as well just finish it up today

300
00:52:46,800 --> 00:53:01,230
I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm not gonna do it. Don't worry

301
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:15,329
Where's the root? Did it take me this long to find it? This is it?

302
00:53:17,619 --> 00:53:26,050
This is it. I found it. This is like a hundred and fifty ones to click on here. What about this one?

303
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:50,280
Magic this is it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh god. Damn it. This actually is the one. Okay, so I mean

304
00:53:50,400 --> 00:54:11,059
What's the song with like that I want to sing before we move on the rats mixtape September. Yeah, it's a good one

305
00:54:11,059 --> 00:54:24,500
How's the sun? It's pretty good

306
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:32,210
It's not fixing my teeth, it's not fixing it

307
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:38,519
But don't matter I can knock this out of the park. You can redo it. Do you remember?

308
00:54:39,639 --> 00:54:42,369
The 21st night of September

309
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:46,369
Love was changing the minds of pretenders

310
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:49,250
Pretender and this

311
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:53,269
It fucked up it did it wasn't even on the screen

312
00:54:53,829 --> 00:54:59,119
Our hearts were ringing in the key that our souls were singing

313
00:54:59,679 --> 00:55:02,739
As we danced in the night. I remember

314
00:55:03,539 --> 00:55:06,590
How the stars stole the night away

315
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:15,349
Yeah, but did ya say that you remember but did ya

316
00:55:16,309 --> 00:55:19,269
Dancing in September. Ah, did ya?

317
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,150
Never was a cloudy day

318
00:55:25,539 --> 00:55:27,219
Oh, no, never mind

319
00:55:27,219 --> 00:55:41,719
It's not that part over again. Bah, do do bah, do do bah, do bah, do do bah, do do bah, do

320
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:57,670
Bah, do do but oh that's I fucking hate this. I almost just clicked stop streaming. I was like hovering over and almost just clicked it

321
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,059
All right, so we're gonna move on

322
00:56:02,019 --> 00:56:07,190
Thanks for hanging out for the irl

323
00:56:07,269 --> 00:56:18,320
Uh, I don't know what I did. It was more than one to do this for like an hour. It's what we're linking

324
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:25,989
It's not fixing my teeth it's not fixing it it probably sounds all right

325
00:56:26,789 --> 00:56:31,190
But don't matter I can I can knock this out of the park. You can redo it. Do you remember?

326
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:34,630
The 21st night of September

327
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:38,809
Love was changing the minds of pretenders

328
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:42,070
and this

329
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:46,820
Why is it off? I was doing this perfect. Why is it off beat?

330
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:54,480
Oh shit

331
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,480
Okay, it's off beat because

332
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,519
This takes like about 150 milliseconds to change the voice

333
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,920
There's a delay

334
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,920
on the actual voice changer

335
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:16,929
I thought you just had no rhythm. No, that's not what it is

336
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:22,630
Don't point change. Yeah, I I actually can fix that in here, but

337
00:57:23,429 --> 00:57:25,940
I didn't think about that

338
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:29,199
Too busy doing another dumb shit

339
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:31,760
Prove it with video evidence

340
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:32,800
I mean

341
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:36,869
Hold on is is this coming out? Correct?

342
00:57:39,679 --> 00:57:45,300
Is that synced up because I have the it's it's turned off right now. It should be like ready

343
00:57:48,679 --> 00:57:50,679
So but now that it's on

344
00:57:56,630 --> 00:58:02,900
The length is the same. So

345
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:06,000
It's because it doesn't matter. Hold on a second. I got an idea

346
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:15,400
Make it go 150 milliseconds. No, I can do this ready. I'm just gonna delay

347
00:58:16,519 --> 00:58:22,840
The yeah, they'll just do this. It should be better. No, so you tell me did I fix it?

348
00:58:23,079 --> 00:58:28,019
Oh

349
00:58:28,019 --> 00:58:30,840
Love was changing the minds of pretenders

350
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:44,800
No, what

351
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:48,579
It's worse now. How is it worse?

352
00:58:51,429 --> 00:58:52,869
Maybe I have to do this

353
00:58:52,869 --> 00:59:01,239
How many respects is it ready?

354
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,400
Yeah

355
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:36,710
Whatever sorry, was that too loud? I have a limiter on the limiter doesn't work. The limiter doesn't work

356
00:59:40,820 --> 01:00:10,099
All right. Thanks for watching this stream. We're gonna play against you now. Okay. Hey guys

357
01:00:10,739 --> 01:00:13,570

Our plane just landed

362
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,320

363
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:44,000
Wait, did you shit in my it? I I just changed the microphone source

Made a loud noise or something. Sorry

367
01:00:53,829 --> 01:00:55,989
That's not my intention at all. I promise

368
01:01:00,769 --> 01:01:03,090
Now it's delayed. Well, it's because I have to do this now

369
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:10,599
All right, let's play catchy

370
01:01:10,599 --> 01:01:12,360
I forgive you this time

371
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:15,960
Thank you

372
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:18,440
It's not still delayed. I could see it in real time right here

373
01:01:23,639 --> 01:01:25,639
Uh, what was it called the band of?

374
01:01:27,489 --> 01:01:29,489

375
01:01:32,039 --> 01:01:34,039
frog frog crew

376
01:01:38,449 --> 01:01:43,250
Play geoguessr. Wait, why am I getting a huge play geoguess geoguessr geoguessr?

377
01:01:44,869 --> 01:01:49,440

378
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:56,360
What is going on in this chat right now?

379
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:57,880
Oh my god

380
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:12,599
Yeah, I mean wait. All right. Hold on. I'm gonna play kenshi for a little while because

381
01:02:13,829 --> 01:02:15,829
I I planned on it anyways

382
01:02:19,909 --> 01:02:24,630
So then after after kenshi maybe a few three four hours of kenshi. I'll

383
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:27,349
Pull out and we'll play some

384
01:02:27,349 --> 01:02:29,670
I don't why would I I don't want to I all right, we'll see

385
01:02:31,619 --> 01:02:33,639
And i'm i'm getting booed

386
01:02:33,639 --> 01:02:35,000
Now i'm getting booed

387
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,199
It's okay

388
01:02:36,199 --> 01:02:39,079
We'll just keep the fucking camera on who cares

389
01:02:39,559 --> 01:02:44,119
Well, this will be it. This will be the one webcam stream every three months that you get on this stream

390
01:02:45,079 --> 01:02:49,199
That's fine

391
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:51,199
And then I need to move over here

392
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:54,900
Uh, this is the frog crew, right?

393
01:03:01,909 --> 01:03:05,510
You actually want to know what kenshi is. It's a great simulation

394
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:09,110
Frog simulating kind of game where you you start as a frog

395
01:03:09,829 --> 01:03:13,349
and you start as a tadpole and then from tadpole you go to

396
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:18,469
Um adolescent and then from adolescent you go to frog and then from frog you go to adult frog

397
01:03:19,110 --> 01:03:22,070
And you eat fish and you um

398
01:03:22,869 --> 01:03:24,869
Eat flies and stuff. It's really cool

399
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:29,809
You get a dog

400
01:03:29,809 --> 01:03:31,809
Now this needs to move this way

401
01:03:35,969 --> 01:03:41,329
And let's open it up

402
01:03:41,329 --> 01:03:43,329
Kenshi back to kenshi

403
01:03:43,969 --> 01:03:49,269
I'm probably gonna mute this for a second just because it's probably gonna be pretty loud

404
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:56,000
Let's go with that

405
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
You should see it right now
