00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:16,309
Hi. Well, how do you do? More gold, Your Majesty. Hey, that's exactly the game we're playing tonight.

2
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:24,519
Welcome, everybody. Hope you've had a swell few days. I've had an interesting few days. It's been

3
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:35,079
very, very fun. Very, very interesting stuff going on. What happened to GTA? I want to play GTA online

4
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:41,140
with people, like others, like do like a streamer, a streamer night. I'm trying to find people that

5
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:47,299
would want to do it because I think it's fun when you bring in like four, like three to four

6
00:00:48,759 --> 00:01:01,670
GTA friends to do it together. So I want to, I want to do it with people, 30 to 50 GTA friends.

7
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:13,159
But anyways, this is a requested game and it's a game that I got very interested in

8
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:20,920
because it's a game it's called Majesty for it's an old one. And in this game, it's kind of in the

9
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,920
RTS strategy game style, but there's one, one, one very large difference. In this game,

10
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:35,000
you do not have any control over anyone in the game. You build your castle, your kingdom,

11
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:49,189
and you don't get to determine what the fuck happens. Is it an anime? No, no,

12
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:57,829
it's not. But thank you lunch meat for the five community subs right off the bat. Thanks lunch

13
00:01:57,829 --> 00:02:06,790
meat. And then phylactery lich gave 50 bucks. Both you guys, I haven't even done anything.

14
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:12,120
And look at this. It's already here. This shitload of money. Thank you for the $50 phylactery lich.

15
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:19,750
Don't you ever leave us again, Jeremy. We need you. You don't need me. It's been inside of you

16
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:33,300
the whole time. You don't need me. It's a Star Wars thing, right? Who said that? Yoda? I'm the

17
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,979
only Majesty streamer in the history of Twitch. I don't believe that at all. But let me just make

18
00:02:38,979 --> 00:03:21,300
a tweet and we'll get started. Give me one sec. Okay. All right. So this is the HD version.

19
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,740
Hopefully there's nothing I need to do for this version. I don't think there is.

20
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:37,830
The thing that I have a problem with in these old games, when they do an HD remaster, they usually

21
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:45,530
just make you hold the binoculars the other way around. And look at the game. It ends up being in

22
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:52,439
this tiny little square. And it like everything's so small. It's like looking at the back of a

23
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:56,969
cereal box. You guys know what I'm talking about? When I say that, you know, when there's a game on

24
00:03:56,969 --> 00:04:02,949
the back of a cereal box, it's an elaborate bunch of shit that they stuff on there. And it's so small,

25
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:09,319
but they had to put as much on there as possible. That's how I feel when they remaster old games.

26
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:22,149
We'll see if that's the case. There it is. Let's get the audio on. It's got a nice little little

27
00:04:22,149 --> 00:04:35,639
jingle. What's my favorite? What's my favorite egg flavor? There you go. Here's your cereal box.

28
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:41,339
This is the back of the Fruit Loops box. No, it's not good. That's not going to be it. This is going

29
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:50,139
to be bigger. It's going to blow up a little. That's my favorite egg flavor. Yeah. Yeah. Egg.

30
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:57,670
What are you talking about? All right. Play game. Please enter your name, your majesty.

31
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:02,139
Um, you're going to have something interesting, right? Am I a king yet?

32
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:13,899
Well, the crown implies yes. Uh, how about, no, not Jax. Not every character has to be Jax.

33
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:23,939
How about, um, I mean, like, that's the person that just gave five community subs. We're going

34
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:35,769
to have to thank him. Thank you, King Ryan Goodstream. Thanks for the five subs. Uh,

35
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:41,050
I'm going to see this for the remainder of this whole game. So we're going to have to, uh,

36
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:46,920
sounds like an old name. No, I don't want to do one of those old jokey names like

37
00:05:47,560 --> 00:06:07,879
this. No, no, no, no, no. It's something easy. No, I don't want to write like an actual Senator's

38
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:31,699
name here. Uh, King Senator. King Senator Jeremy. I kind of like that. That looks good.

39
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:42,889
King Senator Jeremy. Your Excellency, I offer my most humble introduction.

40
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:49,209
I am Lord Van Fairweather. I was your mother's most trusted advisor. Why is his pitch going

41
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:56,579
higher? I submit my services to you in that continued capacity. That was like, it's me.

42
00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:02,180
It's me Cornelius Bartlebus. I forget the name already, but what happened is my voice got pitched

43
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,980
up as I was going through that. I forgot his name already. I'll play the epic quest, the bell, the

44
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:13,370
book, and the candle to get an introduction to the game. There's three different actors.

45
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:18,730
Okay. The bell, the book, and the candle. And they are doing the fucking cereal box

46
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:24,889
bullshit. This is the back of the cereal box. Turn, go, go, go right now. Go get a box of cocoa

47
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:29,610
puffs right now and take a look at the back. They have like, oh, over here is like the fun dome of

48
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:39,079
interaction. This is like two word games over here. Oh, can you find the, the, the four, two can't sams?

49
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:53,379
I've seen this before. This is a secret quest. What was the bell, the book, where the fuck is it?

50
00:07:53,379 --> 00:08:01,220
This is, it's okay. Am I stupid? It's, this is its own game. The bell, the book in the, this one?

51
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:18,170
Find all the hidden objects. It's the spider. The spider down here. I found tree. The forsaken land,

52
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:28,709
the barren waste. Quest for the crown. Rescue the prince. The bell, the book. Where the fuck is this?

53
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:43,429
This is huge. That was it? Quest for the crown, the forsaken land, the barren waste. Secret

54
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:52,549
quest. Is this the crown, the quest for the crown? Quest for the chalice? Is it this one? You just

55
00:08:52,549 --> 00:09:11,399
read it. No, no, no. I said what I was looking for. The bell, the book, and the candle. Okay, there it

56
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:18,600
is. Forgive the intrusion, highness, but we've been robbed. Someone has stolen the magic bell,

57
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,799
the holy book, and the eternal candle. Right from under our noses, they were whisked away from the

58
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:28,519
royal treasury by some scoundrel. We must do something to recover them. They are treasures

59
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:35,000
beyond value. Okay, so we've been robbed. Somebody stole the book, somebody stole the bell,

60
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:42,019
somebody stole the candle. Let's go. Goals. Recover the three items which have been stolen from your

61
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:46,899
palace and hidden in the lairs throughout this realm. No warriors or wizards available in this

62
00:09:46,899 --> 00:10:03,059
quest. Remember, I can't control anybody. What the hell am I supposed to do? All right, so here's our

63
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:14,710
city guard one. This is the buildings. Blacksmith gnome hubble. Where's the vehicle depot?

64
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:20,259
Wait, what? What's going on? Is this a spider?

65
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:30,710
Okay, there are rumors that thieves who stole the artifact from your treasury have fled,

66
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:36,629
but were forced to hide the artifacts as they left. Find the items before the thieves have a

67
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:43,110
chance to return. Okay, so find the artifacts before the thieves have a chance to return.

68
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:52,059
What's going on over here? Guard house? The need and haggis.

69
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:13,059
Heroes. Okay, so blacksmith rogue's guild. Didn't it say that it was going to teach me how to play

70
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:22,620
the game? Am I like mistaken or was that like, hey click on this one if you want to learn? There we

71
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:27,639
go. All right, heroes visit the blacksmith in order to purchase better weapons and armor.

72
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,720
Once you have researched those skills, upgrade your blacksmith and even better items will be

73
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,759
available for you to research. Okay, heroes visit the blacksmith to purchase better weapons. So

74
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:43,539
once you have researched those skills. Okay, so what do I research those skills?

75
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:51,000
Level one. Oh, there we go. Guard house. Guard houses host a member of the city guard and can

76
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:58,899
fire arrows at nearby enemies. Your highness, if our kingdom is to prosper, it needs more heroes.

77
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:04,970
I'm reading. You just like dragged Ebeneezer Scrooge out of bed before he was Ebeneezer

78
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:08,649
Scrooge. I'm just thinking of a guy with that fucking hat on with the thing on the top.

79
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:13,450
And you just put me in the slot as a king. And I'm like, you know, fuck that whole reference.

80
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:18,889
I can fire arrows at nearby enemies once you research that skill. Use them to protect vital

81
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:22,970
buildings or far-flung outposts from your city. Hence men also rest at guard houses if they are

82
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:30,700
closer than the palace. Okay, what are we doing with these things? You'll get it next time. Yeah,

83
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:37,659
I was like gonna go somewhere with that. Okay, so guard houses can fire arrows at enemies. Sounds

84
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:41,740
good. You need to peep. Oh, you want better stuff. But why are they just random people coming over

85
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:48,870
here? And why is the city guard walking around? Is there no these? Is this like another NPC? Is

86
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:56,629
this like a person controlling this? Or are they just wandering around? All right, where's the next

87
00:12:56,629 --> 00:13:02,950
note? Your highness, if our kingdom is to prosper, it needs more heroes. I know. Inns are gathering

88
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:10,259
and resting places here for heroes and allow them to extend their range of their wandering.

89
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:18,220
If you build them outside your main city. Okay, so you want to have inns further out. It's a way

90
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:24,309
for you to continue to have heroes kind of come in and say hello and say what's up. I have no idea

91
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:34,629
what that means. I know that means something. Okay, 120 HP, coffers hold 57 gold. Oh, tax

92
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:42,470
collector. Henchmen, minimum minimum return. Decrease this tax collector's minimum return

93
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:49,269
amount. Maximum pickup. So this guy just walked around and collects taxes. Okay, cool. What's

94
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:56,309
down? What the hell is this? Trading posts are a place for heroes to purchase healing potions.

95
00:13:57,659 --> 00:14:05,879
Healing potions. Your highness, if our kingdom is to prosper, it needs more heroes. I know.

96
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:12,200
I'm gonna try. I need to, hold on. Trading posts are a place for heroes to purchase healing potions.

97
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:17,159
Build a marketplace near your palace and the trading post will periodically send out caravans

98
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:23,159
to them. Okay, so you have a marketplace near your palace. We can get caravans to them. Bringing in

99
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:29,340
a bunch of gold to your treasury. Forget about the random snake ladies that run around. That's

100
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,460
just a problem. They're just, they're like bugs. There'd just be much to watch out for them.

101
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:44,820
Okay, we need more heroes. I'm working on it. I'm waiting for the next thing to pop up. All right,

102
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:52,149
what, what do we got? Cast farseeing. There's no wizards allowed here, right? Palace. Who builds

103
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:59,110
shit? Oh, I do. Okay, buildings. Guard house in marketplace, right? Do we have one of those

104
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:05,559
already? Build a marketplace. Your highness, if our kingdom is to prosper, it needs more heroes.

105
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,200
Who builds the marketplace? Do the guards build the marketplace?

106
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:24,179
Peasants at work on site. How long does this take? Oh, I only have one peasant? No, we need way more

107
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:31,860
than that. Roster. Buildings. Henchmen. City guard. How do I get more peasants? I only have like five

108
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:49,740
people in my whole town. What? Somebody just like crashed. A new thing is complete. Who just crashed?

109
00:15:51,639 --> 00:16:06,409
Okay, got my marketplace. So then that means that I can... Your highness, if our kingdom is to prosper,

110
00:16:06,409 --> 00:16:14,250
it needs more heroes. Okay, how do I prevent this from happening? Oh, the tax collector. Yeah,

111
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:35,580
throw the bag of money. Uh, how do you turn around? Okay, cool. Uh, something, something,

112
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:47,659
your highness, something, something. I need a hero. Recruiter rogue? Why do they just stand

113
00:16:47,659 --> 00:17:12,789
around over here? Don't I have a tax collector? It's me, Roger from American Dad. Uh, is this the

114
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:18,890
zombie following? All right, so we're not gonna make money. Do I not get to determine who gets

115
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:28,569
made in ranger's guild, rogue's guild, trading post? Scott the snitch. Scott the snitch is stealing.

116
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:44,660
Who the fuck is this? Kill him. Get him. He's just taking money from every building.

117
00:17:59,609 --> 00:18:15,079
He's actually doing kind of good. This city sucks. All right, where's my rogue? Don't I have a rogue?

118
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:22,819
Oh, there we go. I can actually drag this around. All right, get this off. I don't know why this is

119
00:18:22,819 --> 00:18:31,829
even here. Oh, there's the rogue. Scott snitches. My mission has paid off. Hold on, is Scott the snitch

120
00:18:31,829 --> 00:18:47,079
killing things but helping me? Is Scott the snitch the rogue that I just hired? What? Hold on a second.

121
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:58,900
I just hired the guy and he just went off to start stealing shit. Okay, we need police. No,

122
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:03,640
sorry, the police are currently dealing with medusas. I need a hero. I need another one of

123
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:09,579
those things to tell me what building I need to make. Guard house? No, I don't have any heroes.

124
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:24,279
Blacksmith research. Let's see, level two weapons. I got plenty of money. Ranger's guild,

125
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:29,609
rogue's guild. All right, I'm going to build like a ranger's guild over here.

126
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:34,970
Majesty, the local blacksmith offers new services. Yes, I just did that.

127
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:54,170
How do I get that off? So are you a hero? Peasant one. Majesty, the local blacksmith offers new

128
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:58,569
services. Scott the snitch. Yeah, this is this dickhead is the one that... Okay, so how do I

129
00:19:58,569 --> 00:20:07,289
tell him to go? Oh, we need more. We need more. Let's get some more. He's a peasant right there.

130
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:17,140
Let's build another ranger's guild. Okay, this is a message to Mr. Titegold. I'm out of here.

131
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:24,900
Kill this thing. Did he just win it? There are monsters attacking the kingdom right now.

132
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:30,420
Killing peasants. There we go. Nice job. Dave the screamer. All right, I like Dave the screamer.

133
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:35,720
Your majesty, our new building is complete. Spells stats. All right.

134
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:47,509
All right, there's the ranger's guild. Arranger. Let's get a ranger here. How do I get them to do

135
00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:52,069
anything? Like go explore. I guess I have to build the buildings and see what happens.

136
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:22,920
Use the flags. I don't even know what that means. Use the flags. Use the lid. This is supposed to

137
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:29,269
be the tutorial and all they've said was, welcome, you need a hero. What the hell? Okay, good. Get

138
00:21:29,269 --> 00:21:42,069
up there. Let's do what we got. It's you up there. So I can keep them in little windows here. Let's

139
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:55,660
get another one. If you double click monsters, you get a bounty flag. Okay. All right, Scott

140
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:11,990
the snitch is doing a pretty good job over here. Is it attacking the caravan? Finally. I killed

141
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:27,339
something. Kill it. Thank you. $350. All right, deposit that. Are you exploring over here? Oh,

142
00:22:27,339 --> 00:22:35,859
you're doing a good job. Kill it. Nice. I feel like I'm just looking at a top down view of World

143
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:45,819
of Warcraft. I'm just looking at Goldshire right now from a top down view. That's my fourth tax

144
00:22:45,819 --> 00:23:00,420
collector. How much bigger is this map to not find this stuff? Visitors. Who's even there? Okay.

145
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:16,549
Seeking. Okay. All right, so Scott the snitch. No, I don't even know what the fuck I just did.

146
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:22,309
I need like the game manual in my lap right now. Sewer entrance.

147
00:23:25,829 --> 00:23:41,380
Okay, let me take a look at what this stuff even is. I don't even know. Trading posts. So let me

148
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:48,970
research something here. Healing potions. They need those. We're getting overwhelmed. I need more

149
00:23:49,049 --> 00:24:10,619
heroes. Thank you. Jeeves, whatever your name is. All right, recruit a rogue. Who's in there?

150
00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:18,309
Two peasants are in the guard house right now. I need to find the book. The rabbit and the

151
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:26,500
candle. Whatever the hell it is. I wish I understood what was going on here. Like,

152
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:33,460
I'm following him. If I double click on you, I can like follow two people at the same time.

153
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:39,049
All right. And then they have different things that scan through buildings, scan through henchmen,

154
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:52,009
scan through heroes. Okay, here we go. Scott the snitch. Okay, I'm gonna keep my spy camera on

155
00:24:52,009 --> 00:25:00,869
Paul the explorer and Scott the snitch. You need warriors. Warriors were not allowed in this

156
00:25:01,829 --> 00:25:03,109
mission, I believe.

157
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:23,420
What? Is it a rat man? What? This is the tutorial? Yeah, and it's not

158
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:32,140
tutorialing me anything. I got three notes left. Sticky notes. I haven't been tutorialized at all.

159
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:49,960
Reward attack flag. This guy's killing everybody.

160
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:59,779
Heroes are often motivated by rewards offered by the sovereign. Oh, what the fuck? It's just a

161
00:25:59,779 --> 00:26:14,410
thousand dollars to kill this guy. Kill a ten thousand. Somebody will kill him. Yeah, you don't

162
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:23,940
have to worry about that. My god. All right, so where is this? Okay, I got that concept now.

163
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:33,000
You got to double click on somebody and offer an amount of money to kill it. Okay, offered by

164
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,609
Senator Jeremy 100 bucks. What does that mean? Offer? Okay, so if you go over here, it's money.

165
00:26:39,609 --> 00:26:45,539
Okay, I get it. Would have loved to have known that like 10 minutes ago. You got to give people

166
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:55,430
incentives to explore. Okay, so I want you go over here. If you go up here, that's worth 300

167
00:26:55,430 --> 00:27:14,869
bucks. No, that's worth 500 dollars. Whoever wants to explore up there. All right, so who the fuck's

168
00:27:14,869 --> 00:27:20,440
going up there? Who's going to take that bounty? All you have to do is walk over here. Are you going

169
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:38,410
to take that bounty? That's easy money. I don't blame you. Okay, research these. How do I get

170
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:45,910
this? Research level two weapons for sale. I can't do that. What else can I build? What's a gnome

171
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:57,690
hover? I'm looking for three items. Let's go down. Look, somebody needs to. No one's going to claim

172
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:07,210
this for some reason. What services may help? Oh, it's marketplace rangers guild. Recruit another

173
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:13,930
ranger. Let's get like five of these guys. You going up there? Oh, you did it. You did it. You

174
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:19,289
claimed it. Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait. No, no, no. A new building is complete. Here's another 200

175
00:28:19,289 --> 00:28:36,359
bucks. Just go up there and go see what's over in the top left. Recruit a gnome. Extort? What does

176
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:45,779
that mean? Collect 226 gold instantly for a cost of 100 gold. You just pull it quick. Okay.

177
00:28:46,980 --> 00:29:05,240
Anybody going up here? Let's get a tavern. It's a inn, right? Yeah. There's nothing even up here.

178
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,460
No, I want to, I'm going to put this over here down by this way.

179
00:29:12,329 --> 00:29:23,700
This is, I dig it. Okay, so I kill these things. Somebody kill it. What have I got here? Let's see.

180
00:29:24,339 --> 00:29:29,099
I still don't understand how you get like shit on the main screen here. Okay.

181
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:35,529
Are they going to be okay? Can they build this down here? It's a bread and brawl.

182
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:44,390
You can put the explore flag in the fog of war. Okay, that's cool. Um, no, go get this.

183
00:29:46,230 --> 00:30:00,460
Look at all this shit. Is it all taken? It's all empty. Somebody go get this. Somebody get this

184
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:08,440
fucking money right there. Get it. Open it. No, open it and run.

185
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:17,180
Nobody's there, but they go, they'll come down here. Peasant six is dead.

186
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:23,500
Big bits. Oh shit. I missed big bits like a minute ago. This guy's dead.

187
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:32,339
Sorry, Paul. I didn't want you to go hang out down here. Uh, thank you agent dark

188
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,039
for the 50 bucks. 5,000 bits from agent dark agent dark booty.

189
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:42,440
Dermot can't tell you how much joy your streams have brought me. I have ADHD and you've honestly

190
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:48,220
been an inspiration for me. Keep up the amazing work. Thank you so much agent dark booty. Uh,

191
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:53,579
I have it too. And you're seeing in this stream right now how, how I'm dealing with it. So thank

192
00:30:53,579 --> 00:31:05,140
you for the five fucking thousand bits. Really appreciate it. Thank you. Uh, he's dead. Okay,

193
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:16,019
so I need to do, uh, should I go in the sewer? Indestructible appear as your kingdom grows in

194
00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:23,220
size, grants, giant rats and rat men access to your town. The wild spirit is needed for larger

195
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:28,900
towns and therefore will not be destroyed. So it just happens because we have too many, uh,

196
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:38,940
people using the suiting. Okay. I'm gonna say let's go down here. That's worth 500 bucks.

197
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:44,140
Someone to explore down that way. This person just at the front, kill, kill this fucking person,

198
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:51,259
please. Just now, right now, anybody. She's just sitting at the front door camping our like newbies

199
00:31:51,259 --> 00:32:03,500
coming out. My services may help. Where are you? Somebody going down there? My services.

200
00:32:06,619 --> 00:32:08,619
Why is Jeff Goldblum in our camp?

201
00:32:08,619 --> 00:32:22,900
Tough fight. House one to build more houses. My services may help range skills. No,

202
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:26,420
I have everything I can do. Unless it's a, I can research something else somewhere.

203
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:36,250
He's going down and going down. We have found an abandoned keep and the missing candle. Destroy

204
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:40,660
the keep and you will recover the candle. All right. I want everybody's attention right now.

205
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:51,049
A thousand dollars to go in there and get that. No. Fuck that. It's $2,000. Oh shit. I'm getting

206
00:32:51,049 --> 00:33:12,940
over there. $2,000. 3000. Where's Elbrey? What are you doing? Oh, he's, he's shooting at it.

207
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,339
He was like, I was like, where is he? Why is he not listening to me?

208
00:33:20,329 --> 00:33:23,849
Okay. He's going to get this free grin. Okay. What happens if I click on this and I drop it

209
00:33:23,849 --> 00:33:33,079
right before it dies to like a five dollar bill? Who's this? Is this a gnome? What do the gnomes do?

210
00:33:35,619 --> 00:33:41,430
He's going to get it. He's the one annoying unit in command and conquer that you don't,

211
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:45,109
you're not prepared for. You don't even realize it. Anytime you played like Warcraft or command

212
00:33:45,109 --> 00:33:51,029
and conquer or red alert or whatever. Once the towns got big enough, you could sneak in and just

213
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:55,109
drop one unit to attack like a farm on the outskirts and they wouldn't even know you were doing it.

214
00:33:55,109 --> 00:34:00,150
And that was the best strategy. Our town is under attack. And they'll be, you have like a

215
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:05,940
fucking extra large map and you don't even know where it is. You have like five

216
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,739
Citadels at that point. You're just like, where the fuck is this guy attacking?

217
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:15,800
That was my strategy. Send one guy to attack the bottom of their base every single time.

218
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:22,679
All right. So I almost got this. What happened to the guy that was, he's running away. He's fleeing

219
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:44,440
in terror. Somebody will get it. All right. I need more heroes. Can I queue them up?

220
00:34:45,079 --> 00:35:03,179
I need more than two. Well, they keep dying. It's impossible to make the left side bigger.

221
00:35:03,179 --> 00:35:08,699
It's hard to read. Yeah. I know we've got a cereal box scenario over here on the left.

222
00:35:08,699 --> 00:35:17,739
Sorry about that. Guild is full. Guild will be full here. All right. Let's take a look.

223
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:28,980
What are they doing? Will you attack the things that are outside the door?

224
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:43,369
Do you still have a $300 bounty? Somebody said, is this just constant noise or am I really high?

225
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:57,880
Kind of. All right. It's time to, okay. I've had enough of this shit.

226
00:36:02,659 --> 00:36:08,789
We're making it way more expensive to kill these things. They're just running absolutely rampant

227
00:36:08,789 --> 00:36:13,909
in the town. Like you have to die. Everybody focus. Whoever kills them gets $1,000.

228
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:33,480
Who's even in here? Guild is full. Get out. Are they all dead? Where are all my heroes?

229
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:49,179
Get the fuck out of here. Get out. All right. Are you guys finally going to do something?

230
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:58,659
Should have had more heroes. I apparently, who is this? Naked Shrek.

231
00:36:58,659 --> 00:37:07,739
I'm going to lose in the tutorial, but look, I'm going to be really fair to myself here.

232
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:14,219
This was not, I was not tutorialized at all. It was just like here. I get overrun by snakes

233
00:37:14,219 --> 00:37:22,469
and monsters. One of you guys in chat told me about this. There's so many of them down there.

234
00:37:24,469 --> 00:37:44,900
Level nine is just sitting in there. Arrows, better arrows. Span guard houses to survive.

235
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:55,750
This is because there's two sewers. I don't remember this. All right. I'm going to have like six

236
00:37:55,750 --> 00:38:07,130
towers. Look, it's already getting better. How much health does this have? This thing's going

237
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:18,949
down. There's one. Okay. All right. I get it. I get it. I get it. Scan through buildings.

238
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:24,389
Scan through henchmen. Scan through. Okay. So this is just what the camera. Okay. So when I was

239
00:38:24,389 --> 00:38:29,750
looking at this before, I thought this, I didn't know this was like scan through a building.

240
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:34,630
I thought this was commands I could try to give to this person. Okay. I get it. I understand.

241
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:41,349
I get it. Scan through reward flags. Yeah. I get it. I understand. I understand. I do. All right.

242
00:38:46,139 --> 00:38:54,619
Double click to zoom to the hero. I can do this too. All right. We go. Is he going to get the

243
00:38:54,619 --> 00:39:01,739
bounty? Kill this thing too. That's a thousand dollars as well guys. I have money.

244
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:11,420
There's too many houses. Why don't you build a house right here?

245
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:15,260
A new building is complete. How dumb are you? Why would this be built here?

246
00:39:16,139 --> 00:39:21,769
It's right in front of the gate. This is the equivalent of having your house

247
00:39:21,769 --> 00:39:26,889
directly under the airport. Like right when the planes come out. You're going to hear this like

248
00:39:26,889 --> 00:39:31,210
five, 10 times a day, a hundred times a day. The bridge dropping right next to your bedroom door.

249
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:43,880
Okay. Tax collector. Is somebody going to destroy this building or what? There he is.

250
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:55,190
Sylvis Broadview is going for it. Get out of there. Get out of there. It's not worth it. Why

251
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:59,820
don't you work together and split it? You're not going to kill this thing alone. Get out.

252
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:14,440
Sylvis is berserking. Are you going to berserk right into the dirt? Wait. Maybe not. Nope. Nope.

253
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:24,380
Run away. Somebody will get this. This is almost half the money in the whole kingdom.

254
00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:32,699
And you know what? Fuck that. No, that's I can't, I can't take that off. Minimum,

255
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:48,840
minimum return. Let's go with like 500 bucks. The rat man. What the fuck is happening?

256
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:57,719
We're about to get the first triforce down here. Well, now that I know what's going on,

257
00:40:58,519 --> 00:41:06,099
the next thing I do will be a little bit easier. I don't really have enough money.

258
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:19,480
How do you still have a thousand dollar bounty on your head? I don't know how it's impossible.

259
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:34,860
I'm going to scan through the flags here. Attack flag. No, get rid of that. You won't get your

260
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:51,480
money back. Oh, fuck. No, nevermind. I didn't know that. Really threw a bunch of shit at me here for

261
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:57,079
teaching me how to play the game. All right. Join the explorer is going to get it. Trading post. Let's

262
00:41:57,079 --> 00:42:15,820
see. He's going to get it. I think this is like a TF2 server. It kind of is. Yeah. Yeah.

263
00:42:17,659 --> 00:42:22,760
It is level 11 though. Not bad. All right. What about the blacksmith?

264
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:28,570
No, no, don't attack the blacksmith. Get that off. I want to upgrade more. How do I do better

265
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:45,929
research in marketplace rangers guild? I don't think I can do anything else. You always need

266
00:42:45,929 --> 00:42:52,659
at least 10 heroes. Okay. Well, I had like five here, but they died instantly when they came out.

267
00:42:53,619 --> 00:43:00,599
Oh, who's going to get it? Is it going to be Feteth the Explorer? Let's see.

268
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:09,539
Medieval Lemmings. That is kind of what it's like. You're right. All right. We're good.

269
00:43:10,099 --> 00:43:15,019
We have as many as we can have. This thing is still going down.

270
00:43:16,699 --> 00:43:24,949
Let me see. Where's that spider? Okay. Nobody's explored down there yet somehow. Weirdly enough.

271
00:43:24,949 --> 00:43:34,809
All right. Uh, everyone's okay. Kill it. Does it really take three of you? Oh, somebody got it.

272
00:43:34,809 --> 00:43:44,230
Who got it? Who got it? Who did it? Pick up the candle. Pick up the candle. Heroes make use of

273
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:48,550
many magical items in their quest. Heroes will pick up any items left unattended. Are you sure

274
00:43:48,550 --> 00:44:06,539
they will? Somebody get it. So many voice lines. What is this thing? Oh, Medusa. Okay. We still have

275
00:44:06,539 --> 00:44:17,300
the same amount of heroes, but the roads suck. Somebody graveyard. Here we go. 14 heroes buried

276
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:29,300
here. Somebody get it. Look, do I seriously have to pay somebody to walk over here? Somebody go

277
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:41,320
over there now. Here comes the screamer. Somebody please pick this up before I lose my mind.

278
00:44:47,300 --> 00:45:01,300
Why are you afraid of going over here? Get it. Get it. It's a free 600 bucks. You fucking idiot.

279
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:22,869
I guess I deserve that. I got plenty of money. I need to bring people down here

280
00:45:23,909 --> 00:45:30,440
because I got this one item just sitting there. Just extort the rogue's guild.

281
00:45:33,269 --> 00:45:38,230
Sorry. Uh, there's construction going on outside. I don't hear. I can't even hear what you mean by

282
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:50,760
this. Research this upgrade. Market day generates sudden revenue, but temporarily closes the

283
00:45:50,760 --> 00:46:04,820
marketplace. Healing potion. Did anybody pick it up? No, of course not. Your marketplace now

284
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:18,940
serves you better. Thank you. So nobody's claimed that yet. Weirdly enough. Your marketplace now

285
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:28,360
serves you better. Uh, henchmen. No, no heroes. I want to follow who's like the level mayor,

286
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:33,449
right? My bar was my bar. There you are. All right. I want to follow you and you.

287
00:46:34,409 --> 00:46:45,510
This is going to be hell going over here. Should I drop the audio? Should I make it like,

288
00:46:46,389 --> 00:46:56,579
maybe is that whatever better? You know what I mean? Maybe it won't be as chaotic and horrible

289
00:46:56,579 --> 00:47:05,590
sounding. That's better. It doesn't sound like four construction yards at the same time.

290
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:15,300
My ambition has paid off. It's the same. No, it's not. Kill it. Oh, tough fight.

291
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:23,610
Oh, tough fight. I can't believe no one's picked this up. I'm never going to be able to complete

292
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:31,559
the mission. Well, it's obviously not top right and obviously not top left. So it has to be like

293
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:40,539
bottom left and bottom right. Do I have to make this more expensive? 1000 bucks. All right. Come

294
00:47:40,539 --> 00:47:58,010
on, Kevin. Claim it, Kevin. Come on, Kevin. No. Upgrade the buildings. I have been, haven't I?

295
00:47:59,559 --> 00:48:10,500
No, I've been, I've been upgrading the building. Yeah. Wild adventure builds character. What?

296
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:19,019
Build more hunters guilds. All right. We're going to expand our influence over here.

297
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:48,119
My services may help. Wait, this is level. Click the arrow. Level. This is like a troll

298
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:53,480
walking around town. This town sucks. Why don't we have a fucking wall or a gate or something?

299
00:48:56,260 --> 00:49:09,829
Why is this so normal? This should be completely abnormal. Next to the picture. Level. Okay. Level

300
00:49:09,829 --> 00:49:22,820
two. I'm reading the goddamn cereal box. Oh my God. All right. Okay. All right. All right.

301
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:27,139
We're good. We're good. We're good. Everybody relax. This is, this is the tutorial we're learning.

302
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:34,900
Oh Jesus. Give me a break. I didn't even know. There was no way I was supposed to tell.

303
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:46,579
I didn't know that. I don't know. All right. Now we've got some real guards out here.

304
00:49:56,679 --> 00:50:01,960
This is the 22nd tax collector. I've had a new tax collector almost each day.

305
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:14,059
All right. Who do we got? Message. Message flag. Oh, did they find it? A hero has discovered that

306
00:50:14,059 --> 00:50:19,579
the book lies in this ruined altar. Raise it. Eh, okay. Raise it. No, I don't want that.

307
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:28,139
A building has been upgraded. We're going for a $2,000 bounty. Go for it. Good luck

308
00:50:28,139 --> 00:50:37,780
to all of you. Can you upgrade houses? No. Okay. I thought that was a dog downstairs.

309
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:48,489
Okay. Rogues guild. Let's get some, let's get a couple more. Keep a building on fire.

310
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:55,659
Yeah. Well, what do you, what do you want me to do? I can't put it out.

311
00:50:56,539 --> 00:51:03,380
I need more palace guards. Level three. You need 12 heroes to get to level three.

312
00:51:08,409 --> 00:51:11,449
Blacksmith. Let's do that. Research level three weapons.

313
00:51:12,329 --> 00:51:25,269
Let's take it down. We got broad view. Level 10. Three grand to get that. What happens if you

314
00:51:25,269 --> 00:51:37,750
don't have enough money? What happens if I put the bounty up for? Nice. Look at this shit over here.

315
00:51:37,829 --> 00:51:40,949
How the hell am I going to do that? There's too many people.

316
00:51:43,429 --> 00:51:47,300
My services may help. Look up here.

317
00:51:50,199 --> 00:51:58,650
My armor in the rogue. Arrows, better arrows and all these

318
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:10,980
build some more trading posts. Your highness, we've improved the god house. Your highness,

319
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:16,980
we've improved the god house. Your highness, we've improved the god house. Your highness,

320
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:22,900
we've improved the god house. Who's going to get it? The local blacksmith offers new services.

321
00:52:25,829 --> 00:52:33,449
There's the holy book plus 20 intelligence. Somebody, okay, who picked up the, who picked

322
00:52:33,449 --> 00:52:48,619
that up? Do I know who has that in their inventory? I serve with pleasure. Let's go. What the hell does

323
00:52:48,619 --> 00:53:00,710
this shit do? Statue. What does it do though? This does. I'm gonna put it over here. I don't know

324
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:17,099
what this is. Your majesty, our new building is complete. Statues raise the loyalty of the

325
00:53:17,099 --> 00:53:25,269
heroes in your kingdom. Okay. Assured that their deeds will not go unrecognized, your heroes strive

326
00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:33,980
to complete their quest with room. Okay, so you need a bunch of statues. So statues make people

327
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:37,820
more happy and more willing to do what you want them to do. They'll listen to you. They'll hold

328
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:49,110
up. Let me clear that. All right, let's do what else we got. Temple of Agrilia requires no temples

329
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:57,480
to Purvis Cryptochrome. Temple of Doris. Temple of, are these like elements? Is this like water,

330
00:53:58,519 --> 00:54:06,500
earth, fire, metal? I don't know. My ambition has paid off. Let's do this one.

331
00:54:08,099 --> 00:54:24,360
Let's put this down here. Temple to Chrom. Not Chrom. Why? What do you mean why? What?

332
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:35,420
What's wrong with Chrom? Wait, can I not have any? I can't have any other temple. It requires it.

333
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:48,230
Give me another trading post up here. You can't build any other temples to build Chrom. Well,

334
00:54:48,230 --> 00:55:06,070
whatever. That's fine. I need a garrhouse down here. This is bad. You can now not build any

335
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:10,150
temples. Yeah, well I'm almost done with the tutorial. I just have to clear the spider den.

336
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:25,000
Why would you do that? Why are you guys coming all the way down here? No, don't aggro all of

337
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:31,210
them. Don't you know that's the biggest mistake in Talked Out Goldshire? Don't do that. You're

338
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:37,369
gonna aggro everybody. Biggest mistake. Level eight. That's why you can tell. You're new to the game.

339
00:55:37,369 --> 00:55:47,989
Don't do it. Oh, he's gonna do it. You did it. You fucked it all up. Sorry, you're like older

340
00:55:47,989 --> 00:55:54,389
brothers not here to power word shield you to make sure that you have fun playing the game

341
00:55:54,389 --> 00:56:00,230
because you're doing so terribly that your older brother knows that he has to fucking play priest

342
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:06,070
to make to and he's doing everything possible to keep you alive while you just dick around

343
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:15,269
and shoot at uh like monsters. What? I told you. I told you you got an older brother with you.

344
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:21,340
Oh shit. I don't want like I don't want Michael to die because he's fucking gonna be sad.

345
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:34,360
Power shield's on cooldown. Fuck. Just top him off. He's dead. No way you're gonna live.

346
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:44,469
He actually has it. And all the brother hanging up behind the tree over here casting like greater

347
00:56:44,469 --> 00:57:03,619
heal. What about you? Do you have like a brother playing with you? What are you guys doing down

348
00:57:03,619 --> 00:57:12,949
here? Oh, okay, then brothers out of mana. So comes up and tries to pull aggro. It's all right,

349
00:57:12,949 --> 00:57:20,869
man. It's okay. What happened? Well, you you stood there a little too long. But it's okay. Just run

350
00:57:20,869 --> 00:57:26,150
back. Do you see the mini map? I don't see the mini map. Okay, hold on. Wait, fuck. Okay, let me

351
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:40,010
move. Let me go in the other room where you are and like do it for you. There it is. The bell has

352
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:43,849
been located in this ruined shrine. Destroy this shrine and reclaim what is yours. How am I gonna

353
00:57:43,849 --> 00:57:50,500
do this? This is tutorial. This is a fucking tutorial. And you're gonna surround this with

354
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:55,449
enemies. They ain't enough old brothers in the world to be able to protect me.

355
00:57:57,699 --> 00:58:06,860
Let's go. Oh, he found a bunch of stuff. They're gonna go down there one by one. How many heroes

356
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:15,639
do I have? I'm going with I'm going all out. We're just recruiting everybody. I serve with

357
00:58:15,639 --> 00:58:23,989
leisure. Oh, right. This thing. What's this? Recruit barbarian. Rage of Krom. Enrage your

358
00:58:23,989 --> 00:58:31,139
heroes with Krom's power for 1500 bucks. You guys get something wrong. You don't like them?

359
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:57,559
What's wrong with the barbarian? I should just do all barbarians. Makes me stronger. Okay.

360
00:59:01,159 --> 00:59:07,909
These guys are expensive. These things are level one. Why? They're only level one though.

361
00:59:11,929 --> 00:59:19,050
Where are they going? I don't know. Where are they going? I'm not going to click that right now.

362
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:24,010
Is anybody? Wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What's going on over here?

363
00:59:29,739 --> 00:59:47,030
By the way, guys, this is a $10,000 bounty on this. 6000 bucks. Who's going to be brave enough?

364
00:59:48,440 --> 01:00:02,619
Level four. Oh, me. I do. Level one. No one's going to go over here.

365
01:00:03,579 --> 01:00:14,219
This is gonna get swarmed. This is impossible. This is impossible. There's no way I'm going

366
01:00:14,219 --> 01:00:33,179
to be able to get this. I need like 100 people. Where is this guy? Oh, here we go. We've got a

367
01:00:33,179 --> 01:00:44,380
bandit here. It's probably going to defuse to leave too. I hope this guy comes over and just

368
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:54,039
snipes it. Tough fight. Tough fight. Tough fight. No, they're not ready for this. I gotta pull the

369
01:00:54,039 --> 01:01:00,599
bounty. Wait a minute. Come on. You can do it. Send to the barbarians. No, you're not going to.

370
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:12,860
You're dead. This guy's level three. All right, hold on. I want to see. Keep an eye on that.

371
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:35,909
And then I want to go to a palace guard. What? Shit. Okay. I have a level 11 in here.

372
01:01:36,789 --> 01:01:51,460
Who's killing the tax collectors? Everybody. I'm going to extort this graveyard with 15 heroes

373
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:59,480
buried there. They're coming in. Here we go. This is where it's going to get interesting.

374
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:12,889
All right, let's do it. Let's do it. Rage of Krom. Get it. End the tutorial, please.

375
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:26,070
Tutorial over. You guys told me not to build Krom. Krom is the best.

376
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:38,820
Just use this movement speed increase to get over here. Is it just last hit? Whoever gets the last

377
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:52,900
hit? No, it's spread out. That's cool. That's it. Thank you. Now I understand what's going on.

378
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:58,500
The bell, book, and candle are back in their rightful place. We also found the thief who

379
01:02:58,579 --> 01:03:05,139
stole them from the castle. A rogue identified as Cherik of Keldurn. Unfortunately, he escaped

380
01:03:05,139 --> 01:03:10,900
while being returned to the castle with a 15,000 gold piece reward on his head. I'm sure he'll

381
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:18,489
think long and hard before returning to our kingdom. All right, Cherik. Total gold, 55,000,

382
01:03:18,489 --> 01:03:25,880
9800. Almost 985 would have been interesting. Total gold spent. Spent on research, spent on

383
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:32,969
buildings, spent on heroes, spent on spells. Cool. Visits to Elven Lounge or gambling hall.

384
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:49,449
What? You can do that? 49 heroes recruited, 42 dead. If I had like no... Look, now I understand

385
01:03:50,329 --> 01:03:56,090
to like keep them leveled up, keep them happy, get some guard houses, make sure there's some taverns,

386
01:03:56,090 --> 01:03:59,289
make those some gambling halls in case they feel like playing a couple of games like working

387
01:04:00,010 --> 01:04:11,179
Keno 157 dead for Henchmen. All right. Cool. No, no, no, no, no no no no

590
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:26,020
think? pretty pretty great, right? I would say that's... I can't wait to hear your review.

591
01:33:26,819 --> 01:33:34,560
this is a terrible place for that to be. all right. level three. I need 12 heroes. these guys are

592
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:41,939
all the way down here, huh? they gave me... no. I'm not gonna say that out loud because it's bullshit.

593
01:33:42,899 --> 01:33:48,979
sovereign. our marketplace now serves you better. I'm gonna put another wizard's tower down here,

594
01:33:49,699 --> 01:34:07,739
right? can I do that? it has to be like within the distance of this. you can go down here.

595
01:34:08,619 --> 01:34:10,079
that might have been really dumb. I don't know.

596
01:34:14,930 --> 01:34:26,449
quick parry. just farming levels on bears. not a big deal. has to be in range of the guild tower.

597
01:34:26,449 --> 01:34:39,840
okay. so then now that this is here, I can do this, right? yeah. well, nothing over here.

598
01:34:40,399 --> 01:34:57,359
nothing over here? well, let's get down to the right and enchant the tower. you can make it a

599
01:34:57,359 --> 01:35:13,409
turret. oh, shit. let's go down here. 300 bucks. 400, I guess. and then like 200 bucks to go down

600
01:35:13,409 --> 01:35:22,590
here. oh, that's nice. that actually works. I'm just gonna make like... okay, I gotta build something

601
01:35:22,590 --> 01:35:27,869
here. I gotta have something right here. I don't know. another wizard's tower, maybe?

602
01:35:28,750 --> 01:35:37,329
quick parry's level 10. yeah. he's gonna be... he's gonna carry everybody.

603
01:35:41,220 --> 01:35:44,739
there goes sharp wood. where's quick parry? I want to always be following quick parry.

604
01:35:45,779 --> 01:35:55,840
it's the second one. quick parry is hanging out in the inn right now. okay. just always have a

605
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:58,800
camera on quick parry. and he has like a teleportation ring. oh, creature down. get it.

606
01:36:00,159 --> 01:36:08,720
kill it. well, you got... you did what you were supposed to do, but I didn't have to pay you

607
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:19,090
any money, so that's good. trading post? down... where? down here? that's actually not a good

608
01:36:19,090 --> 01:36:34,140
idea. let's see what we got. put it close to one of the guard houses? oh, fuck. who just died?

609
01:36:34,140 --> 01:36:47,380
that was in quick parry, right? fuck. get those taxes. more. more money. all right, quick parry's

610
01:36:47,380 --> 01:36:51,220
going down here with his like... he made... everyone wants to follow quick parry because he's just so

611
01:36:51,220 --> 01:37:02,210
good. how much... how many potions does he have? five. you need more than that, don't you? fuck it.

612
01:37:02,210 --> 01:37:12,579
get him out of here. this is as far as it can go. we'll go to level three. not yet. need more. rogue

613
01:37:12,579 --> 01:37:21,869
skilled. five is the max carry for potions? oh, okay. makes sense. the burger was good, a little

614
01:37:21,869 --> 01:37:29,840
too salty. definitely an s-tier though for fast food. oh, yeah. yep. we got the official review.

615
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:34,609
fries kind of suck. yeah, that's... they do.

616
01:37:39,340 --> 01:37:49,220
all right, i can almost do level three. what are we doing down here? oh, look at this fucking party

617
01:37:49,220 --> 01:38:00,380
down here. keep going. i can do... i'm gonna beat it right now. stay together. take the whole thing.

618
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:05,739
ash house in vegas was great. i'm so happy that somebody ate there.

619
01:38:07,329 --> 01:38:12,850
quick parry gonna go and just kind of take this whole thing by himself.

620
01:38:16,220 --> 01:38:23,489
go rescue him by yourself, dude. he even helps out his teammates. how do i keep this guy around

621
01:38:23,489 --> 01:38:29,489
forever? uh, ash house or gogo in the link is... the burgers are just unfucking believable. the

622
01:38:29,489 --> 01:38:33,970
food's unbelievable. it's up in 24 hours. if you're ever in las vegas, do yourself a favor

623
01:38:35,310 --> 01:38:39,069
and eat that. just eat at ash house or gogo. it's like the best fucking... like at least

624
01:38:39,069 --> 01:38:47,470
late night restaurant in vegas. uh, where the hell is this prince? okay, i'm gonna build down here.

636
01:40:28,180 --> 01:40:37,020
all right, good. keep it going. protect this area, quick parry. try to keep the marketplaces

637
01:40:37,020 --> 01:40:40,140
close to the palace, because the tax collector needs to get all the way to them. that's true.

638
01:40:40,779 --> 01:40:45,579
all right, the peasants are down here. let's do a mage guild tower. Your Majesty,

639

642
01:40:55,420 --> 01:41:02,859
I'm gonna do another an inn. I'm gonna do a trading post. That might be dumb. I

643
01:41:02,859 --> 01:41:10,779
don't know. Statue? We're building a whole other town down here. Wizards Guild

644
01:41:10,779 --> 01:41:28,819
right there. Got it. Creature Den. Get rid of that. Got the inn. Nice. Now we can hang out in

645
01:41:28,819 --> 01:41:39,989
here. Got a guard house. Put those arrows. All right, this is gonna be a victory

646
01:41:39,989 --> 01:41:52,270
here. There's so many bears down here. I got it. Trading post. Complete. Wizards

647
01:41:52,270 --> 01:42:08,260
Guild. Complete. Let's get some wizards. All right, I'm almost out of money. Creature Den.

648
01:42:08,260 --> 01:42:33,670
Get that for 200 bucks. 300 bucks. Hold on. Wait. Hold on. What the hell are you guys

649
01:42:33,670 --> 01:42:44,789
doing? This better save. This is gonna crash my game. All right, what the fuck are you doing?

650
01:42:44,789 --> 01:43:21,029
What are you guys spamming? Piss on me. Piss it. Piss in my face. Do it. I'm fine. I can hold my

651
01:43:21,029 --> 01:43:31,500
breath. The second I start to smell some pee, I can just boink. I don't know what this is. What

652
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:38,220
is this? This is on camera. Piss on me. Piss it. Piss in my face. I don't know what the fuck this is.

653
01:43:38,779 --> 01:43:44,350
What's the con- I mean, it's clearly on like a stream, but I don't know what the context is.

654
01:43:44,350 --> 01:43:50,270
This is probably a deep fake. Do it. I'm fine. I can hold my- Is that a deep fake? It might be a deep

655
01:43:50,270 --> 01:44:01,189
fake. Breath. The second I start to smell some pee, I can just- No, this is from- That's a- I

656
01:44:01,189 --> 01:44:10,260
think that's a deep fake. You tried though. That sounds like something I would say. And maybe. It

657
01:44:10,260 --> 01:44:24,680
depends on the context. Does anybody know what that's from? It was from Super Fight. Oh, okay.

658
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:31,100
That makes sense. Yeah, Super Fight was you had to come up with insane scenarios as to why your

659
01:44:31,100 --> 01:44:45,979
character would beat the other person's character. So still no sign of this prince. I don't know

660
01:44:45,979 --> 01:44:53,149
where the hell he is. Context being behind you wanting someone to piss in your face.

661
01:44:56,260 --> 01:45:05,460
His superpower was probably like pee. Can I keep exploring down here? Find this prince.

662
01:45:05,460 --> 01:45:15,710
There's a hundred dollars in it for you. Okay, I'm gonna do- Can I do Farsight from here? I need

663
01:45:15,710 --> 01:45:28,409
one of those hands out of the ground. Halt! Where's um- Quick Perry is over here. Just hanging out.

664
01:45:28,449 --> 01:45:40,939
Alright, let's uh- Somebody kill this troll, please. What do I need? What do I need? I need to kill him.

665
01:45:40,939 --> 01:45:47,989
He's gonna cause a problem. Extort that money. Alright, now I'm gonna do a- What the hell is Fairgrounds?

666
01:45:47,989 --> 01:45:57,779
I'm just gonna put it over here. I don't even know what it does. Set the agenda for royal tournaments by

667
01:45:57,779 --> 01:46:06,100
choosing magic, melee, archery, or combo. Heroes may purchase training to enhance their abilities.

668
01:46:09,670 --> 01:46:19,850
So it's just like a training ground. Can you do an impression of Elmo impersonating Seth

669
01:46:19,850 --> 01:46:25,210
Rogan impersonating Beetlejuice impersonating Tommy Wiseau making fun of Dan Aykroyd trying

670
01:46:25,210 --> 01:46:36,229
to sell you crystal skull vodka? What at home? What is it? What does it say again? I don't know

671
01:46:36,229 --> 01:46:47,560
what that means. I'm not gonna do that. Anyways, let's go down here. Let's get up wizard 2.

672
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:59,779
That's too much to think about. My brain stopped comprehending what you were saying after

673
01:46:59,779 --> 01:47:08,760
the word Seth Rogan. That's it. I don't know. Alright, where is this prince? I've explored

674
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:17,300
everything. Alright, you know what? We're making it really worth people's while. Get over here.

675
01:47:17,300 --> 01:47:28,340
Let's go. 1,500 bucks. Who's on their way? Where's Quick Perry? Message. Oh, there it is. Where? Hold

676
01:47:28,340 --> 01:47:37,659
on. Did I skip 1,500 bucks for no reason? There was a message flag. Wait, wait, wait. Where is this?

677
01:47:38,300 --> 01:47:53,109
Oh, there it is. Alright, release the prison. $2,000 to the person that can take this now.

678
01:47:53,829 --> 01:48:04,600
Quick Perry's just gonna do it by himself. Well, hold on. We got level four. These guys good.

679
01:48:09,239 --> 01:48:23,109
Quick Perry's gonna just take it all. Get in there. Save the prince. Sick. He teleported behind

680
01:48:23,109 --> 01:48:32,039
the bear. That's some next level plays by Nelson Quick Perry. This is a victory writer.

681
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:45,619
Do I have to bring him back? Here's the worst part about this. I could have finished this

682
01:48:45,619 --> 01:48:51,619
mission in like five minutes if I had just gone down over here. It's right next to the town.

683
01:48:52,260 --> 01:49:00,470
I went in a full horseshoe around. That's kind of bullshit, but whatever.

684
01:49:00,470 --> 01:49:20,739
The obelisk was a hint too. Was it? I kept seeing it. Turn back. Oh, it was one of those stupid

685
01:49:21,699 --> 01:49:28,840
this is the evil lair. Turn back. Don't come into the evil lair. Promise nothing bad over here. It

686
01:49:28,840 --> 01:49:37,859
was one of those scenarios. Alright, we saved the prince. The prince is a rat? We saved the

687
01:49:37,859 --> 01:49:47,270
rat prince. Majesty, your heroes have returned the prince of Val Morgan to his kingdom.

688
01:49:48,090 --> 01:49:54,329
A caravan from the queen of Val Morgan now waits at our gates. Cool. The treasures it carries are

689
01:49:54,329 --> 01:49:59,449
most glorious to behold, but more important is this brief note from the queen herself. What was

690
01:49:59,449 --> 01:50:05,609
he saying? She writes, my thanks for the recovery of my son goes beyond any material reward I could

691
01:50:05,609 --> 01:50:11,449
offer. Your compassionate leadership is an inspiration to all of Ardenia. That was

692
01:50:11,449 --> 01:50:20,229
pitch shifted. It was. Clip that and just listen to that again. That last three or four sentences

693
01:50:20,229 --> 01:50:33,300
were a little higher. Strange. Getting better. The last time I had 47 recruited heroes and

694
01:50:33,300 --> 01:50:45,989
42 of them died. Now I've been much more focused. Standing buildings, gold balance, okay.

695
01:50:46,789 --> 01:50:58,420
All right. Quick carried. Let's see. Yes. Senator Jeremy's fine. Nice. Now try another quest.

696
01:50:58,420 --> 01:51:04,819
Advanced if you haven't yet. Don't tell me to do that. Oh, I'm not ready for advanced. I still

697
01:51:04,819 --> 01:51:17,720
don't even know what half the buildings do. Do it. No. Look at this one. Expert. This one's beginner.

698
01:51:19,140 --> 01:51:29,100
Valley of the Serpents. Vengeance of the Lich Queen. Put a bounty on Quick Perry so everyone

699
01:51:29,100 --> 01:51:38,810
has to attack him and he solos everybody. Put like a $50,000 bounty. Okay. Oh, the dark forest.

700
01:51:40,170 --> 01:51:51,939
The wizard's curse. Now that sounds really boring. Quest for the crown. Quest for the

701
01:51:51,939 --> 01:52:11,380
crown. I'm not ready for this. Not ready. I'll try it. I'm not ready though. An enlightening

702
01:52:11,380 --> 01:52:16,420
discovery, your highness. The crown of Sidrian, the long lost symbol of your family's power,

703
01:52:16,420 --> 01:52:22,420
has been located. It's being held in an evil fortress on the frontier. The recent waves of

704
01:52:22,420 --> 01:52:28,340
monster attacks have left your people dispirited. Reclaiming this item will doubtlessly boost your

705
01:52:28,340 --> 01:52:33,859
subject's faith and renew the support of your family's house. I greatly urge you to take

706
01:52:33,859 --> 01:52:42,569
advantage of this unexpected opportunity. Okay. So we have to go get the crown. Find and destroy

707
01:52:42,569 --> 01:52:52,420
the lair that the crown rests in. Pretty simple. Pretty simple thing to do. Okay. Let's go. Let's

708
01:52:52,420 --> 01:53:01,779
go. No fucking around. Right back. Get a ranger out there. Were there any stipulations? In the

709
01:53:01,779 --> 01:53:09,500
name of the sovereign. Market. Immediately. Blacksmith. Immediately. Level two weapons.

710
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:15,640
Immediate. Wizard. Immediately. Rogue's guild. Immediately. Warrior's guild. Immediately.

711
01:53:16,199 --> 01:53:24,970
Hurry up. More. Get him out there quick. Now. Okay. This is already, I'm already dead.

712
01:53:24,970 --> 01:53:29,770
Majesty. Oh my god. Blacksmith offers new services. Oh my god. I didn't know that we're

713
01:53:29,770 --> 01:53:39,430
gonna be here right now. They're already, this is, is this possible? Is this possible? This is

714
01:53:39,430 --> 01:53:55,800
impossible. It didn't even get 30 seconds. What the fuck are you supposed to do about this? How

715
01:53:55,800 --> 01:54:03,159
are you supposed to beat this? In the name of the sovereign. It offers new services.

716
01:54:03,159 --> 01:54:34,250
Uh. Um. In the name of the sovereign. What the? Um. Uh. In the name of the sovereign.

717
01:54:34,250 --> 01:54:41,699
Why, what happened over here? Who, who sprinted? Somebody was like, I'm gonna get away from the

718
01:54:41,699 --> 01:54:45,380
town. I think what's left or right? I don't remember where I'm lost in the forest. I think

719
01:54:45,380 --> 01:55:02,550
it's the left here. Oh shit. I'm back in town. I just lose. Uh. This is interesting. So what

720
01:55:02,550 --> 01:55:16,359
do you, how do you do this? Um. It's not over yet. In the name of the sovereign. Your majesty. A

721
01:55:16,359 --> 01:55:26,409
new building is complete. I'm good. Let's go. Your majesty. Rebuild. Rebuild everything. Uh.

722
01:55:26,409 --> 01:55:33,960
What do I need to rebuild? I don't, they killed, they killed everything. Um. I don't have any

723
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:42,970
money I used to every cent. Where's the tax collector? Your marketplace now serves you

724
01:55:42,970 --> 01:55:59,460
better. Uh. Oh shit. Here comes another one. Okay. It's no way. It's too hard. Um. An inn?

725
01:56:00,979 --> 01:56:13,220
Royal treasury is nearly empty. The royal treasury is empty. They just keep coming.

726
01:56:15,020 --> 01:56:19,189
I don't think I'm gonna be able to do this. I'm gonna have to restart it. An inn? Well,

727
01:56:19,189 --> 01:56:23,029
it doesn't, you don't have any heroes. Oh fuck. Um. I don't have any money.

728
01:56:25,270 --> 01:56:33,100
They killed everything. All right. Redo. Redo. Redo. Your majesty. A new building is complete.

729
01:56:33,100 --> 01:56:46,100
I have to immediately just start melting everybody. No. Restart. Here we go. Right off the bat.

730
01:56:46,100 --> 01:57:00,229
Bingo. Wizards guild. Right now. Quick. Another one. Hurry up. Go. Because I'm gonna be like.

731
01:57:01,029 --> 01:57:21,779
Oh. No no no no no. Shit. What do I need to, immediately. Uh. Okay. Um. Heroes. And then zap

732
01:57:21,779 --> 01:57:31,800
the fuck out of everybody. Anybody that comes over here. Just, just.

733
01:57:45,239 --> 01:57:53,539
Who's left? Anybody else? Okay. Where that, coming from the bottom too, right? More.

734
01:58:04,600 --> 01:58:34,760
Again? All right. I've got no more money. I don't have any more money. Oh my god. I'm out of money.

735
01:58:38,140 --> 01:58:46,569
I don't have any more fucking money. How the hell are you supposed to do this? This is like

736
01:58:46,569 --> 01:58:57,420
30 minotaurs that come up here. I don't even have money to do this. It's over.

737
01:59:01,260 --> 01:59:03,500
Get out there. It might not be completely over. Hold on.

738
01:59:10,010 --> 01:59:13,609
Just raise taxes. Actually this is not. If these guys level up down here.

739
01:59:16,380 --> 01:59:21,829
Call to arms. Come on. Get everybody back here. Right here. If they can level up. If I can take

740
01:59:21,829 --> 01:59:34,439
this for a minute. Where's my tax collector? That's okay. Level four. That's not terrible.

741
01:59:35,939 --> 01:59:46,699
All right. Hold on. I need to build a. Where's the blacksmith? Level three armor. Level three

742
01:59:46,699 --> 01:59:52,020
weapons. And hopefully these. The warriors can carry it. Where the hell did they go?

743
01:59:52,819 --> 02:00:03,800
They're all in the inn. Just sitting there. Get out of the inn. Inn. I need a. No. I need an inn.

744
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:08,840
No I don't. What do I need? A guard house? That's not going to do anything. What is that?

745
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:18,520
What is that and why is it here? Are they going to be able to kill this?

746
02:00:26,380 --> 02:00:34,659
No way man. No way. You get that. This is too quick. Too fast. Too happening.

747
02:00:34,659 --> 02:00:40,699
It happened way too quickly. How are you supposed to keep up with this and not lose all your money?

748
02:00:46,100 --> 02:00:56,899
New building. You just get overwhelmed and you have money but. I wonder.

749
02:00:58,819 --> 02:01:02,420
I feel like this is like a puzzle level where you just need to do something in a very specific

750
02:01:02,420 --> 02:01:20,380
order. All right. We're not doing this one. Let's go to. How the hell are you supposed to do that?

751
02:01:24,550 --> 02:01:32,010
For the slaves. Quest for the magic ring. A deal with the demon. Wizard's curse.

752
02:01:32,569 --> 02:01:41,739
I'm not the beginner. Should I? Yeah. We're doing the wizard's curse. I'm not going to skip.

753
02:01:59,340 --> 02:02:04,939
Great tome is beyond measure. You and your realm must now pay a price for its loss.

754
02:02:06,140 --> 02:02:13,979
Until such a time as sufficient good deeds have been performed I curse all the dwellers of this

755
02:02:13,979 --> 02:02:23,050
land to be as stupid as the dead. We can have a permanent debuff. Okay hold on. There are two

756
02:02:23,050 --> 02:02:28,569
different ways to rid the curse. Method one. Arrest the hooligan who stole the book of spells. Return

757
02:02:28,569 --> 02:02:34,970
it to the wizard and then perform whatever the wizard deems sufficient good deeds. Method two.

758
02:02:34,970 --> 02:02:42,260
Destroy the angry wizard. Your heroes are cursed so they won't act like their regular selves.

759
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:51,369
Wizard's guilds and temples aren't available in this game. Arrest the hooligan who stole the book.

760
02:02:54,260 --> 02:03:03,060
Okay. Who stole the book? In order to guide your kingdom to prosperity and shed the wizard's curse

761
02:03:03,060 --> 02:03:08,340
you have two options. Either find the idiot hooligan who stole the book and then perform

762
02:03:08,340 --> 02:03:14,500
what the wizard refers to as good deeds. Or confront the wizard and destroy him. Send all

763
02:03:16,739 --> 02:03:21,859
heroes to arrest all of the realm's hooligans so they can be detained and searched at the palace.

764
02:03:27,449 --> 02:03:43,500
What? Okay well we need we need a marketplace. We need how much money do I have? 13,000?

765
02:03:44,140 --> 02:03:58,520
I serve with pleasure. How do I um how do I question? Not question um your highness let's do

766
02:03:58,520 --> 02:04:06,039
if our kingdom is to prosper it needs more heroes. Let's do warriors guild. Warriors guild rangers

767
02:04:06,039 --> 02:04:14,890
guild right next to each other here. Where are the hooligans? Actually I want two rangers guilds.

768
02:04:14,890 --> 02:04:22,329
I want a bunch of rangers in due time apparently. All right so your majesty a new building is

769
02:04:22,329 --> 02:04:33,659
complete. Healing potions are important right off the bat. Let's go with a inn as well over here

770
02:04:33,659 --> 02:04:51,659
somewhere. Your marketplace now serves you better. How do you detain somebody? The heroes will. Okay

771
02:04:52,619 --> 02:05:03,590
okay rangers guild let's get a bunch of rangers. Your highness if our kingdom is to prosper it needs

772
02:05:03,590 --> 02:05:10,789
more heroes. I know that's what I'm doing. A new building is complete. Your marketplace now serves

774
02:05:30,329 --> 02:05:39,079

775
02:05:39,079 --> 02:05:45,899
camera two. What's wrong with them? Oh right they're like idiots right? They don't they're

776
02:05:46,140 --> 02:05:53,289
stupid right? There's something wrong with them. Yeah they don't listen to me. They just like kind

777
02:05:53,289 --> 02:06:06,489
of walk around in circles. All right let's get a blacksmith over here. Yes ruined keep demon wood

02:06:37,300 --> 02:06:40,340
Don't do anything stupid. Don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't do that.

781
02:06:40,340 --> 02:06:52,460
What do the gnomes do? I haven't figured that out yet. Let's see. Recruit gnomes. Additional gnome

782
02:06:52,460 --> 02:06:56,939
hubbles are automatically built as you recruit gnomes. Destroyed hubbles will be rebuilt

783
02:06:56,939 --> 02:07:01,979
automatically. So just they just keep going all over the place?

784
02:07:03,739 --> 02:07:10,439
That's cool. They just help build stuff. That's cool. All right let's get another

785
02:07:11,880 --> 02:07:17,720
building is complete. What's that blacksmith? I need to get better weapons.

786
02:07:22,039 --> 02:07:30,090
They're super fast. That's cool. Anybody level one level one? Finish building this. What are you

787
02:07:30,090 --> 02:07:42,359
doing? I don't even know what's happening over here. There's more of this shit over here. All

788
02:07:42,359 --> 02:07:57,449
right. Your majesty a new building is complete. Quickly come on. Finish the blacksmith.

792
02:08:14,970 --> 02:08:20,569
good. Your highness we've improved the guard house. Your majesty. Nice. All right level four. Not bad.

793
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:39,979
Don't die. Don't get yourself killed. Now I need that blacksmith. Let's go. A perfect game for

794
02:08:39,979 --> 02:08:44,539
Jerma. No micromanagement at all. You just like let people do whatever they want to do.

795
02:08:44,539 --> 02:08:54,810
He's actually pretty fun. Your majesty the local blacksmith offers new services.

796
02:08:56,939 --> 02:09:07,260
Keep it up. If they just did just stop running to randomly play. Come on. You're only level four.

797
02:09:07,260 --> 02:09:12,859
Would you have any potions or anything? Nothing. So don't go up here. Your majesty the local blacksmith

798
02:09:12,859 --> 02:09:23,100
offers new services. Thank god. You're not an idiot. Top five. This map is pretty small. All

799
02:09:23,100 --> 02:09:35,720
right. So let me build. I serve with pleasure. I don't have an inn. Who died? Somebody's dead?

800
02:09:37,779 --> 02:09:47,899
Unwelcome guest. Who died? Your majesty. Sovereign a building has been upgraded. Tax collector. All

801
02:09:47,899 --> 02:09:58,329
right. Let's let this guy's got to go. He's down here too far. Somebody kill it. Friendly lodge up

802
02:09:58,329 --> 02:10:04,659
here. Your majesty a new building is complete. That's too tough for me. At least you're smart

803
02:10:04,659 --> 02:10:11,050
enough to know that. We've got to get rid of this thing. No the level one is going to go and fight

804
02:10:11,050 --> 02:10:24,250
it. No. It's just sitting outside the door staring at us. Oh get these. All right there's a hooligan

805
02:10:24,250 --> 02:10:37,609
right there. Go get him. Open these treasure boxes. Guess that's the guy right there. Collect him.

806
02:10:38,250 --> 02:10:41,930
There he is. One of your heroes has arrested a hooligan. Maybe this is the subject who stole

807
02:10:41,930 --> 02:10:50,680
the book. He's on his way to do your palace to be interrogated. Nice. Hopefully he doesn't get hit

808
02:10:50,680 --> 02:11:05,220
by like a rock. We're good right? Is it him? I want to like keep my eye on him. What's going on over

809
02:11:05,220 --> 02:11:23,449
here? He's being leeched of levels by what? Okay in the palace. Who's in there? What's that ring

810
02:11:23,449 --> 02:11:42,390
thing? Was it him? Oh what? Another person arrested. Get him in there. So this is the second

811
02:11:42,390 --> 02:11:53,930
person we've arrested. Who is the one? Who's the illegal guy? All right let me focus on this again.

812
02:11:54,649 --> 02:12:09,020
Go to the blacksmith. Get uh level three weapons. Message another one. Arrested another person over

813
02:12:09,020 --> 02:12:17,189
here. They're all on this side. Explore over here. They seem to all be like hanging out over here.

814
02:12:22,649 --> 02:12:26,409
Majesty the local blacksmith offers new services.

815
02:12:29,050 --> 02:12:34,250
How are we doing on this? Good. That's not good. That's pretty bad actually. Get rid of that now.

816
02:12:34,250 --> 02:12:37,289
That's scary of enemy. 700 bucks kill it.

817
02:12:42,630 --> 02:12:48,920
New services. You have arrested every hooligan in the land except one. The other hooligans have

818
02:12:48,920 --> 02:12:53,960
confessed to his whereabouts. Unfortunately he has learned some spells from the spell book

819
02:12:53,960 --> 02:13:08,279
and is not likely to return it without a fight. Where is he? Is this him? Is he level 10? Wait

820
02:13:08,279 --> 02:13:16,470
he's just like coming up to the city. Kill him. What is he dropping? He's dropping like a nuke on

821
02:13:16,470 --> 02:13:28,140
us. Oh my god. A thousand dollars to the man that kills him. Do I have anybody that's like

822
02:13:28,140 --> 02:13:37,659
level five or 10? All right here we go. 1100 bucks kill him. My services may help. Oh no

823
02:13:37,659 --> 02:13:43,100
and a rat just came out. Does everybody get on him? Level four. Level four. Level four.

824
02:13:45,369 --> 02:13:52,520
Why would you not attack the guy that's over here? Get him. Get him. Kill him.

825
02:13:58,600 --> 02:14:11,859
He's learned a few spells. Got it. Get the book. There it is. Now what? Now what do we do?

826
02:14:12,420 --> 02:14:31,029
What's going on? I'm confused. Do we have to return the book? Wooden sign. Peasant. What's

827
02:14:31,029 --> 02:14:47,460
a peasant doing over here? All right get rid of this. Fancy iron sign. Okay. How do I give

828
02:14:47,460 --> 02:15:13,050
him the book? That's a trader peasant. What do you mean trader peasant? Is that a trader? I don't

829
02:15:13,050 --> 02:15:19,739
have enough money. I need more like uh I need a trading post right? I wonder if I can no no no

830
02:15:19,739 --> 02:15:26,409
don't attack it. Now that you have recovered his spell book the wizard who cursed your kingdom

831
02:15:26,409 --> 02:15:30,569
demands that you perform adequate good deeds in order to atone for your citizens blunders.

832
02:15:30,569 --> 02:15:36,489
There is a peasant who has been taken captive by a few crazed werewolves. Free her and dispel

833
02:15:36,489 --> 02:15:48,899
the curse for good. That's her right there. He's almost dead. Level seven. How do I free her?

834
02:15:49,699 --> 02:15:56,329
I serve with pleasure. Call to arms. Get everybody in now.

835
02:15:58,970 --> 02:16:13,340
What do we how do we save her? Um what do we do about this? She's just walking around the town.

836
02:16:19,109 --> 02:16:21,829
Kill the werewolves baby. All right well don't nobody kill her.

837
02:16:23,829 --> 02:16:31,140
I'll get to build it again. All right here we go werewolves. We're not ready for this yet.

838
02:16:31,140 --> 02:16:35,989
I need some more level heroes but you're the only one that's worth anything right now.

839
02:16:38,360 --> 02:16:40,680
You just keep exploring. I'm gonna destroy some of this shit over here.

840
02:16:41,479 --> 02:16:47,670
Where's the um building has been upgraded. What the fuck is the we gotta wipe out some of this

841
02:16:47,670 --> 02:16:57,340
trash down here. Yeah ruin shrine. Get rid of this. Okay I need some more uh I need more warriors.

842
02:16:57,340 --> 02:17:07,690
Some more rangers. Some more maybe some rogues. Getting rid of this creature den too. My services

843
02:17:07,690 --> 02:17:15,750
may help. Level four armor for that first level four weapons. You're gonna take that on yourself?

844
02:17:15,750 --> 02:17:22,100
Okay good. How many werewolves are there? There's probably like looks like four or five.

845
02:17:22,739 --> 02:17:37,620
You're not doing too bad. Somebody died. Um palace is really expensive. Majesty the local

846
02:17:37,620 --> 02:17:42,340
blacksmith offers new services. All right level four weapons in armor are available.

847
02:17:43,459 --> 02:17:51,219
I didn't even I'm just gonna recruit like five ten gnomes. Just bring them out here.

848
02:17:54,280 --> 02:18:07,420
Uh oh. House is full. House is full. Those things aren't as dangerous as I keep thinking they are.

849
02:18:07,420 --> 02:18:14,069
A local blacksmith offers new services. Level seven. This guy's just been farming this building

850
02:18:14,069 --> 02:18:24,059
and leveled up like three times. All right uh marketplace down here. Trading post. I don't

851
02:18:24,059 --> 02:18:31,979
know how I need a trading post. Trading post you need to needs to be close right.

852
02:18:34,940 --> 02:18:42,729
Let me look at this one more time. Here is my purchase healing potions. Caravans periodically

853
02:18:42,729 --> 02:18:49,450
depart from your trading post bringing gold to your marketplace. The more further away the more

854
02:18:49,450 --> 02:18:54,729
gold it makes. So so like if I put it all the way down here then it'll be a lot of money.

855
02:18:55,610 --> 02:19:00,340
So you want your marketplaces to be close but you want your trading posts to be far away.

856
02:19:00,979 --> 02:19:05,909
Well level nine get back. Don't kill yourself here. Don't like get killed.

857
02:19:08,549 --> 02:19:18,090
Teleport back to town. All right. A new building is complete. Take this out. 200 bucks.

858
02:19:21,590 --> 02:19:27,370
All right. Your trading post now offers healing potions.

859
02:19:31,799 --> 02:19:35,000
Always upgrade your marketplace level three as soon as possible.

860
02:19:37,030 --> 02:19:44,120
Just tech. Yeah that's true. All right trading post is here. Another one of these uh

861
02:19:48,760 --> 02:19:53,620
the gnomes are actually kind of cool because they just they kind of just like run around

862
02:19:53,620 --> 02:19:57,540
aimlessly in random places and help. So that's cool. I'm gonna keep as many of them as I can.

863
02:19:58,260 --> 02:20:04,790
100 bucks whatever kills that. All right uh I think it's time to go and kill the werewolves.

864
02:20:11,850 --> 02:20:18,500
All right. They're gonna kill this. Oh shit. A level seven died here.

865
02:20:22,200 --> 02:20:26,920
Why would you aggro the tree when just kill this? Don't kill her.

866
02:20:36,950 --> 02:20:45,979
1900. I need to get this level three. I'm on my way. Yeah they're doing all right. After this

867
02:20:45,979 --> 02:20:52,979
I'll have a couple of leg level nines. How beast approaches. You idiot. I knew that was

868
02:20:52,979 --> 02:21:04,229
gonna happen. I knew that was gonna happen. I just knew it. All right. Now here we go.

869
02:21:06,309 --> 02:21:25,239
300 for you. 300 400 for you. 400 for you. Go for it. Take out the werewolves. Do not attack this

870
02:21:25,239 --> 02:21:30,469
building. That would be a very big mistake. Heroes can be resurrected if you build a mausoleum.

871
02:21:32,440 --> 02:21:43,610
Really that's cool. Get out of here. I mean that was a lot of money but I haven't been able to do

872
02:21:43,610 --> 02:21:54,600
that the whole game. Oh shit. Too much confidence. Too much confidence. How many healing potions? No

873
02:21:54,600 --> 02:22:04,280
more healing potions. Why did you do this? Level 10 is about to die. Oh man. Get out. Don't be an

874
02:22:04,280 --> 02:22:11,020
idiot. Don't be an idiot. I did it. I did it.

875
02:22:41,639 --> 02:22:44,040
Back in storage. All should be well.

876
02:22:48,549 --> 02:22:51,719
That was a pretty good Disney goofy thing.

877
02:22:55,639 --> 02:23:04,360
All right cool. My ladies it's good to see you again. As you're well aware

878
02:23:04,360 --> 02:23:11,399
Ardenia's heartlands have flourished under your steady rule. Indeed your leadership has ushered

879
02:23:11,399 --> 02:23:17,399
in a new era of prosperity. Ready for expert. However the untamed frontier of the northern

880
02:23:17,399 --> 02:23:24,520
reaches remains a haven for chaotic forces that still threaten our fair land. It is my council

881
02:23:24,520 --> 02:23:31,000
that you begin a northern expansion to dwell these agents of turmoil. While this adventure presents

882
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:38,200
great challenges it offers even greater rewards. I'll now take my leave majesty so that you may

883
02:23:38,200 --> 02:23:45,670
consider this undertaking and decide where to begin. So here's something that I'm not I don't

884
02:23:45,670 --> 02:23:58,569
really understand. So am I getting something for doing this? The rewards will be in my or is it

885
02:23:58,569 --> 02:24:06,620
just missions? Because is there a reason to do anything? It's just the campaign okay. Well

886
02:24:07,739 --> 02:24:13,500
let's try another advanced one. Hold off the goblin hordes. I don't like those ones.

887
02:24:14,870 --> 02:24:23,510
Trade routes. Clash of empires. Legendary heroes. Rise of the rat men.

888
02:24:28,389 --> 02:24:33,989
Sovereign the rat men grow bolder day by day. Their numbers appear to increase and strange

889
02:24:33,989 --> 02:24:39,909
new sounds can be heard issuing from our sewers. Rumors have reached our ears of a new ruler among

890
02:24:39,909 --> 02:24:47,510
rat kind. I'll road it with a taste for surface conquest. We must be vigilant against a potential

891
02:24:47,590 --> 02:24:54,149
rat men invasion. If they choose to strike we must target their new leader. Without their ruler the

892
02:24:54,149 --> 02:25:02,379
rat men will not be able to maintain such an onslaught. So destroy rodent the rat king and

893
02:25:02,379 --> 02:25:16,120
all broken sewer mains in the realm. Now I get to be the giant rat. So we gotta kill rodent the rat

894
02:25:16,120 --> 02:25:29,770
king. Look at all these sewer entrances. What? There's a ratapult. Oh my god um level two level

895
02:25:29,770 --> 02:25:40,489
um elven bungalow. I need some guard houses I think. Embassy.

896
02:25:45,190 --> 02:25:49,989
Is it gazebo? I don't know what any of this shit does but look at all these

897
02:25:49,989 --> 02:26:00,360
sewers. Gazebo. Heroes may rest here for a time. Okay fountain. An extra tax collector has been

898
02:26:00,360 --> 02:26:12,379
enlisted to your service. That's pretty good. And then what was the other one? Your majesty

905
02:27:03,930 --> 02:27:08,969
All right this is what I wanted to say. This is why I did this. A local blacksmith offers new services.

906
02:27:10,329 --> 02:27:22,200
Oh damn it. What is that? Elven. Your highness we've improved the guard house. Elves doubles the amount

907
02:27:22,200 --> 02:27:27,479
of gold generated by your marketplaces. An elven lounge will soon be built in any settlement

908
02:27:27,479 --> 02:27:35,639
containing an elven bungalow. Okay that sounds pretty good. I need uh what do I need to do here?

909
02:27:37,270 --> 02:27:44,059
Are the elves good? Yeah I'm just gonna fill this place with elves.

910
02:27:47,100 --> 02:27:58,739
What's wrong with this person's voice? Are we taking this out? Get rid of this. This is like

02:27:58,739 --> 02:28:04,819
the sewer main. Okay I need to do what we got here. Arrows arrows arrows. You uh.

Rat man shaman. This is really bad. Very bad very bad very bad. Um. Uh.

02:34:29,770 --> 02:34:34,329
Where the fuck are you going? Why are you going up there? What are you? Are you stupid? Stay

956
02:34:34,329 --> 02:34:44,700
with the team. All right. Blacksmith. Good. Everyone's got a decent level right now.

957
02:34:44,700 --> 02:34:50,940
I serve with pleasure. Four four. As long as I can get everybody for like four or five.

958
02:34:53,100 --> 02:34:53,979
Shit. Here they come again.

959
02:35:00,229 --> 02:35:03,450
Good. What else do we need to do here?

960
02:35:05,979 --> 02:35:11,879
If they come. Forget about the bounties. They'll just do it on their own.

961
02:35:12,760 --> 02:35:16,469
How many warriors? I got no warrior has died.

962
02:35:27,239 --> 02:35:31,559
This is not. I held off that very first ridiculous wave. Now I'm going to do.

963
02:35:32,200 --> 02:35:37,020
How is this unmatched? How much money do I have? Not a whole lot.

964
02:35:38,459 --> 02:35:44,700
Robin, your marketplace now serves you better. A building has been upgraded.

965
02:35:45,659 --> 02:35:53,319
They're just kind of going on their own now. Where's like another one of those rat kids?

966
02:35:53,319 --> 02:36:01,379
Oh shit. Here they come. Your majesty, the royal treasury is nearly empty.

967
02:36:01,860 --> 02:36:10,299
Your highness, the dwarves are offering to move into our domain in the name of the sovereign.

968
02:36:10,299 --> 02:36:14,620
I don't know what the hell I need to do here. I have no money. A local blacksmith offers new

969
02:36:14,620 --> 02:36:17,420
services. Is there a trading post down here? There is. There already is one down here.

970
02:36:18,540 --> 02:36:28,020
Don't get overwhelmed. Fight together. I take the path less traveled.

971
02:36:28,020 --> 02:36:36,809
All right. They built up this one. This is still okay. I have all level four stuff.

972
02:36:37,690 --> 02:36:46,409
I don't have enough to do the the chrome thing.

973
02:36:51,770 --> 02:36:57,270
Come on. Stay alive. Please stay alive.

974
02:37:02,860 --> 02:37:09,930
I can't do it. I don't have money. Are we losing people? We have not lost

975
02:37:09,930 --> 02:37:14,840
any knights. We haven't lost anybody. Everybody's still alive.

976
02:37:15,079 --> 02:37:23,239
Come on. Do it. And then I gotta go up here. And I'm gonna put a bounty on this.

977
02:37:23,879 --> 02:37:37,239
We have to start clearing all these rat holes. I need to put up though. I don't have any fucking money.

978
02:37:38,440 --> 02:37:52,280
Tax collector. How much you got? $40. The guard tower. I'm just trying to see.

979
02:37:52,280 --> 02:37:59,079
Money wise. I don't have very much. All right. I gotta fucking get rid of these.

980
02:37:59,159 --> 02:38:03,819
I gotta fucking get rid of these. $400 to get rid of that. Take out that that rat hole.

981
02:38:07,219 --> 02:38:10,020
Kill this thing too though. Don't just like leave the town completely abandoned.

982
02:38:18,760 --> 02:38:27,049
Somebody kill it. Somebody go up there and kill it. I don't know where they're going.

983
02:38:27,049 --> 02:38:36,379
But they're going over this way. This has to be killed. I gotta do like an...

984
02:38:36,379 --> 02:38:39,420
I gotta build some shit up here. But I don't have any fucking money. I did it all wrong.

985
02:38:40,379 --> 02:38:49,690
I'm gonna say a dwarven settlement. Just put it like over here. How's everybody doing?

986
02:38:54,629 --> 02:39:05,879
Here they come. Another big rat recruitment. Well they all have good weapons. They're all

987
02:39:05,879 --> 02:39:12,200
leveled up as high as they can. The royal treasury is nearly empty. Do I need more? I still I kind

988
02:39:12,200 --> 02:39:20,629
of don't understand how this works. I'm still trying to figure because it's almost like rise

989
02:39:20,629 --> 02:39:33,620
in nations. Are they actually gonna go up here? Marketplace level three.

990
02:39:41,430 --> 02:39:47,420
Oh they're doing it. No they're not. He's gonna die. Why are you the only one up here man?

991
02:39:48,540 --> 02:39:53,829
How could you be the only person up here? And you're very strong too. This is bad.

992
02:39:54,629 --> 02:40:04,940
Why would you go up there by yourself at level four? Shit. No. No. Everybody come back.

993
02:40:09,659 --> 02:40:22,819
Beast approaches. We gotta get rid of this shit. I need to make a...

994
02:40:28,299 --> 02:40:32,780
I don't know what would be... a wizards guild? I'm gonna make a wizards guild I think.

995
02:40:34,059 --> 02:40:40,260
Because I lost a couple people I think. They're gonna level up.

996
02:40:40,899 --> 02:40:52,729
I don't know if they're gonna be able to hold us off. Come on kill it. They're just pouring people

997
02:40:52,729 --> 02:41:02,360
over here. Never ending. You have to kill those little rat dens immediately. Like within five

998
02:41:02,360 --> 02:41:09,459
minutes of the game starting or you lose. I just don't know like the all the tech trees to be able

999
02:41:09,459 --> 02:41:15,590
to go that fast. It's still possible if I can level these guys up to like level eight, nine,

1000
02:41:15,590 --> 02:41:23,510
ten. At least most of them or half of them even. Still have only 1300 bucks. Marketplace is gone.

1001
02:41:24,469 --> 02:41:30,649
Majesty! The palace is under siege! You did it! All right. He did it. He did it. He got that one.

1002
02:41:30,649 --> 02:41:46,100
I think there's only two more. Stay alive. Keep this alive. Please. You can do it. The critters

1003
02:41:46,100 --> 02:41:59,059
are under attack. Okay I need my marketplace back. Marketplace. Marketplace. Marketplace.

1004
02:41:59,860 --> 02:42:05,850
It's literally all my fucking money. Oh shit.

1005
02:42:06,409 --> 02:42:08,899
All right. No.

1006
02:42:11,399 --> 02:42:13,799
There's the one down there and there's one up here somewhere too.

1007
02:42:14,840 --> 02:42:22,360
Your majesty. Your treasury is nearly empty. No damn money. Our new building is complete.

1008
02:42:22,360 --> 02:42:27,799
Level six. All right. What do we got? What do we have? Level seven. We got a level seven.

1009
02:42:28,680 --> 02:42:35,540
It's Sir Stahl. We just need one of these guys. Sir Stahl. Sir Stahl where are you?

1010
02:42:36,260 --> 02:42:38,899
You're just doing your own damn thing aren't you? Get back down here. We need you.

1011
02:42:40,100 --> 02:42:51,379
Very very badly. Looks like they're making their way down here. Very good. Take this out.

1012
02:42:51,940 --> 02:42:59,850
I don't have any money. Your marketplace now serves you better. New wave is going to be

1013
02:42:59,850 --> 02:43:13,299
coming here in a second. Where's Sir Stahl? What? Don't kill the warrior's guild. This is it. All

1014
02:43:13,299 --> 02:43:21,930
right. Take him out. Get rid of this rat cave and then I should be all right. I might get a minute

1015
02:43:21,930 --> 02:43:47,959
here. There we go. Take it out. Nice. Keep doing it. You guys can do it. Yes. I need an inn.

1016
02:43:49,959 --> 02:43:53,559
They killed the inn. They also got rid of the dwarf thing that was over here. All right. I need

1017
02:43:53,559 --> 02:44:02,700
an inn for people to hang out and rest. I need to make money. Don't go all the way over here.

1018
02:44:02,700 --> 02:44:08,299
Please guys. What are you thinking? Don't do that. You're just going to die. There's no reason for

1019
02:44:08,299 --> 02:44:14,100
you to go over there. Level six. Level four. I need you guys. Your marketplace now serves you

1020
02:44:14,100 --> 02:44:25,909
better. Better marketplace. Good. Market day. There's nothing even in there. I haven't even

1021
02:44:25,909 --> 02:44:30,950
explored half the map. No, I know. Are these two just going to be like a team here and go take a

1022
02:44:30,950 --> 02:44:40,540
bunch of shit out? Sewer entrance. I think they're just going to be on their own. Hopefully they stay

1023
02:44:40,540 --> 02:44:48,379
together. What do we got? Level seven. Level six. We have a couple level sevens now. All right.

1024
02:44:48,379 --> 02:44:57,180
Kill this thing. Please. I need the marketplace down here.

1025
02:45:03,180 --> 02:45:12,309
Forever penniless. I need an inn though. That's more important because I just I need an inn over

1026
02:45:12,309 --> 02:45:24,709
here. Who's had that? Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. What did you guys do over here? What did

1027
02:45:24,709 --> 02:45:32,760
you guys step on? Where is he? Where's rat man? Oh my god. They're attacking from every angle.

1028
02:45:32,760 --> 02:45:50,809
Where's the king? Where's king rat? Did I hit the enrage timer? Where is he? Oh are they doing it?

1029
02:45:57,059 --> 02:46:01,020
Please stay alive. They're destroying the palace.

1030
02:46:04,729 --> 02:46:10,489
Holy shit man. This is hard. This is insane. I don't know where he is but I think people

1031
02:46:10,489 --> 02:46:14,409
are dying. Level eight. Where's uh stall? Stall is in the middle right here.

1032
02:46:16,409 --> 02:46:20,969
Come on. You can do it. He's got one. They're already at a 65 HP. Come on.

1033
02:46:21,770 --> 02:46:35,559
Get everybody over here. Call the arms. This is over. I'm dead. Unless like actually stall does

1034
02:46:35,559 --> 02:46:44,889
this on his own. What am I supposed to do about this? I hit the enrage timer. I had to have.

1035
02:46:45,610 --> 02:47:02,100
Majesty. The palace is under siege. Stall dead? He's dead. Wow. This is really really really hard.

1036
02:47:04,260 --> 02:47:18,819
Wow. You gotta be bang bang bang bang bang bang bang. Go faster. Yeah I know right.

1037
02:47:20,469 --> 02:47:32,790
He's alive. Take that. This guy is. Your actions permitted or two. Well beast approaches. Well I

1038
02:47:32,790 --> 02:47:47,899
mean the palace is under siege. I probably. These guys are still alive though. They're

1039
02:47:48,459 --> 02:47:53,260
this might not be a total loss. Well the palace is gonna explode but can these guys do it? Look

1040
02:47:53,260 --> 02:47:57,780
they're kind of melting this thing. I got a couple level. I got a level eight in here.

1041
02:48:00,139 --> 02:48:10,059
Well of course they came out of the sewer. Level seven. No level eight's dead. I just

1042
02:48:10,059 --> 02:48:21,670
don't have enough money. Name of the sovereign. Oh well. I'm kind of surviving but I don't have

1043
02:48:21,670 --> 02:48:26,709
enough money to supplement anybody here and I don't want to build anybody. I don't want to

1044
02:48:26,709 --> 02:48:36,620
because this is gonna be level one. I need an inn for them to go into. Somebody please build an inn.

1045
02:48:36,620 --> 02:48:44,500
In the name of the sovereign. My prowess is unmatched. They're kind of doing it but

1046
02:48:52,819 --> 02:49:06,149
it almost feels like it for nothing. There's another broken sewer man over here. They're alive.

1047
02:49:07,670 --> 02:49:24,340
They're alive but they just never-endingly pour in. I need an inn. Please build an inn for these

1048
02:49:24,340 --> 02:49:35,209
guys to hang out in. Level eight. Level eight. Level eight. Level seven. I think this is possible.

1049
02:49:38,649 --> 02:49:44,250
They're all gonna be leveled up. They all have the best armor. They have the best weapons.

1050
02:49:44,889 --> 02:49:49,110
I just need potions. I need a marketplace so they can buy potions.

1051
02:49:50,620 --> 02:49:59,700
Your majesty, our new building is complete. Okay the inn is done. Marketplace.

1052
02:50:00,420 --> 02:50:17,659
1400. Come on. I lived. I actually lived. These guys are actually really really high level now.

1053
02:50:18,379 --> 02:50:19,979
Come on. Where's my money?

1054
02:50:19,979 --> 02:50:34,020
I'm just getting free levels.

1055
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,399
You know what I'm telling you at this point I think I gotta just go.

1056
02:50:40,440 --> 02:50:44,120
I gotta just go take this band of people and have them explore up here and try to just kill

1057
02:50:44,120 --> 02:50:57,799
the rap king. I think that's the plan. That's the strategy. I got two one two three little eights.

1058
02:50:58,680 --> 02:51:01,370
Maybe just let them just hang around here and just gain.

1059
02:51:03,129 --> 02:51:11,930
Is my blacksmith gone? Kind of. All right. Thousand bucks.

1060
02:51:13,850 --> 02:51:23,590
I wouldn't go all the way down there if anything. Go this way. I didn't know you

1061
02:51:23,590 --> 02:51:34,680
guys were still alive. I still have these random explorers. No! Okay that's just-

1062
02:51:35,319 --> 02:51:39,219
All right. I'm done. Instead of every single person. Let's go.

1063
02:51:39,700 --> 02:51:45,129
Majesty the palace is under siege. Oh my god. I can't believe you just let the fucking happen.

1064
02:51:46,540 --> 02:52:01,770
Let's go. Everybody up there now. Explore. Go. Forget it. Beast approaches.

1065
02:52:03,139 --> 02:52:07,379
I have no- I just have no money. I can't do anything. I'm just constantly putting

1066
02:52:07,940 --> 02:52:10,899
my fingers in holes that are spewing out on the side of the boat.

1067
02:52:11,620 --> 02:52:26,360
Name of the sovereign. Granny. Granny Nash is going up there. Good. Go up there grandma.

1068
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:41,100
And everybody else going up there. Besides one person. I would laugh my ass off if you just like

1069
02:52:41,100 --> 02:52:51,770
threw an axe at the guy's head. Only one person going for that bounty. The rest of you are just

1070
02:52:51,770 --> 02:53:02,059
walking around in circles. Come on granny. Just find him. Level seven. What do you got for potions?

1071
02:53:04,469 --> 02:53:12,780
Zero. I'm gonna turn back down here and everyone's gonna be level 10.

1072
02:53:17,030 --> 02:53:28,790
Why is he the only person that cares about this? This is very very concerning.

1073
02:53:38,659 --> 02:53:54,040
Nobody else cares. And he's gonna get lost up here and he's gonna die. Good work. I don't have

1074
02:53:54,040 --> 02:54:16,739
enough money to pay the bounty. Where is the king? Where's Rat King? I think they're gonna

1075
02:54:16,739 --> 02:54:27,379
do it though. I think they'll be okay. Are they? Who's still alive? Level eight. Level eight. Level

1076
02:54:27,459 --> 02:54:47,930
seven. They're all right. He's not even going for the bounty. All right. Find it. In the name of

1077
02:54:47,930 --> 02:54:58,010
the sovereign. Get this thing out of here. Holy shit. They're literally everywhere now. Everyone's

1078
02:54:58,010 --> 02:55:06,700
still fine. The palace is under siege. Our foul beast approaches. Eight eight eight seven seven.

1079
02:55:06,700 --> 02:55:18,260
Is this still all right? No. No. No. No. Please just stay up here. Don't come all the way back

1080
02:55:18,260 --> 02:55:36,790
to the castle. Somebody please. Level eight. Level eight eight eight seven seven seven.

1081
02:55:36,790 --> 02:55:37,989
They're all still alive.

1082
02:55:53,940 --> 02:55:58,020
Why won't you just go over here? What? You're gonna walk all the way back down because you

1083
02:55:58,020 --> 02:56:01,700
want the bounty that is already down here that's being claimed by everybody that's already down

1084
02:56:01,700 --> 02:56:18,389
here. There's a scroll? Where's the scroll? Rodan the Rat King has burst up from the sewers to take

1085
02:56:18,389 --> 02:56:25,290
over your kingdom. Destroy him and all the broken sewer mains to end the menace. Wait was he? Where

1086
02:56:25,290 --> 02:56:32,489
is he? In the name of the sovereign. Where is he? Majesty the palace is under siege. Where the hell did he go?

1087
02:56:37,239 --> 02:56:51,530
Where? He's here? I don't see him. We've got two level nines. Every single sewer is a broken sewer

1088
02:56:51,530 --> 02:57:04,010
main now. Um. I serve with pleasure. Destroy them all. Destroy all the broken sewer mains.

1089
02:57:07,670 --> 02:57:15,719
I mean I have a couple I have some really strong units. I don't even know. Man shaman.

1090
02:57:16,520 --> 02:57:31,459
Oh fuck a level eight's dead. Majesty the palace is under siege. Take that. In the name. This is bad.

1091
02:57:34,299 --> 02:57:38,459
Uh this is I think Rodan's unfortunately. We only have like five people here.

1092
02:57:44,780 --> 02:57:53,670
Take that. Is he over here? Kill him. Kill him. He's right there. There he is.

1093

03:00:00,250 --> 03:00:06,489
unconsciousness the mighty wizard Brezenthal insisted that there was only one way to halt

1106
03:00:06,489 --> 03:00:13,290

1838
05:15:12,520 --> 05:15:18,200

1843
05:16:08,540 --> 05:16:15,529
cell all right let's do we'll do like one more scenario i think that'll take us to the end here

1844
05:16:16,169 --> 05:16:37,220
clash of empires ultimate sphere of power the valley of the serpents why would this one be

1845
05:16:37,220 --> 05:17:02,279
beginner the siege should i try it let's see what happens i'm gonna go for it majesty our battle

1846
05:17:02,279 --> 05:17:07,319
with the hostile and barbaric kingdom of borg in the conqueror has brought us to a siege of his

1847
05:17:07,319 --> 05:17:13,639
stronghold we must either force his surrender by blockading his supply caravans or storm his

1848
05:17:14,599 --> 05:17:22,680
this game is complicated by our local wizard skill which has chosen to side with borgens forces

1849
05:17:22,680 --> 05:17:25,880
still i feel we can prevail if you act decisively

1850
05:17:37,580 --> 05:17:44,619
okay what's the plan destroy borgens palace or cut off the caravan routes supplying him with gold

1851
05:17:46,490 --> 05:17:50,250
if they run out of resources they will surely be forced to surrender to our forces

1852
05:17:50,250 --> 05:17:59,580
no wizard guilds may be built okay what i got in the front here guard houses upgrade them

1853
05:17:59,580 --> 05:18:11,099
immediately okay what do i have can i do paladins that's what we're gonna do we've improved the

1859
05:18:52,229 --> 05:18:57,270

1860
05:18:58,229 --> 05:19:20,299
right but that makes sense doesn't it i need some more uh knights just build 25 towers might not be

1861
05:19:20,299 --> 05:19:31,540
a bad idea it's kind of half versus half and it's this is their uh they're gonna have a

1862
05:19:33,380 --> 05:19:39,639
warriors guild who are these people are they gonna give me money we're gonna be friends

2018
05:49:13,400 --> 05:49:28,520
i think that's a good place to go so i've got to tell you that's pretty fun there's a little

2019
05:49:28,520 --> 05:49:36,139
you know just it was cool i vaguely remember playing this a long long time ago vaguely

2020
05:49:36,779 --> 05:49:45,590
and not understanding what to do and i still didn't but no that was fun so i have a list of

2021
05:49:45,590 --> 05:49:55,580
games that i would like to play over this next few days and those games are gonna be where the

2028
05:50:46,740 --> 05:50:56,580
games on each of those streams not 24 hours but those streams will probably be at least

2029
05:50:56,580 --> 05:51:00,900
eight to ten hours long i would say because i had there's a lot of games that i have queued up that

2030
05:51:00,900 --> 05:51:09,240

2034
05:51:36,810 --> 05:51:41,689
it's kind of interesting to see what they do i wish there was a little more variables and

2035
05:51:41,689 --> 05:51:44,889
variants to what they did but we're also talking about a game that came out in 2000

2093
06:00:43,020 --> 06:00:45,819
hey germa i've been going through a rough time recently just want to say that your streams have

2094
06:00:45,819 --> 06:00:49,740
really kept me going thank you for brightening mine and everyone else's day

2095
06:00:49,740 --> 06:01:08,919
to my heart it's my pleasure thanks for allowing me to do this three four times a week thank you

2096
06:01:08,919 --> 06:01:18,900
10 bucks and hopefully you get through whatever you're going through you will thank you so much

2097
06:01:18,900 --> 06:01:32,380
for the 10 bucks four times a week kappa i know i was i was up until the carnival up until uh the

2098
06:01:32,380 --> 06:01:42,419
carnival stream really started to get work done on it i was doing four times a week now it's been

2099
06:01:42,419 --> 06:01:50,659
kind of brought down to like two or three but all things patience patience all things you'll see

2100
06:01:51,299 --> 06:02:05,000
despite your big projects i always enjoy the small streams i'm not i'm not gonna stop doing that

2101
06:02:07,349 --> 06:02:11,430
i said that a long long time ago this is like probably two or three years ago

2102
06:02:12,310 --> 06:02:20,150
i said that i want to start to move more focus onto stuff that's not video games i did say that

2103
06:02:20,790 --> 06:02:26,330
and slowly i've been trying to find ways to make more interesting things potentially happen on

2104
06:02:26,330 --> 06:02:33,580
streams not just playing a game or not just kind of hanging out trying to figure out what would

2105
06:02:33,580 --> 06:02:47,340
be fun to do with like a live broadcast and i think over the last year or two i have been

2106
06:02:47,340 --> 06:03:01,130
throwing in a lot of stuff that's not me just playing a game but no i don't i don't think i'll

2107
06:03:01,130 --> 06:03:09,020
ever not do stuff like this because i have fun just sitting here hanging out and talking

2108
06:03:13,819 --> 06:03:20,459
and you can't really do that with uh some of the streams that i've done in the past

2109
06:03:21,340 --> 06:03:29,450
it's fun just to talk and crack fucking jokes and have you guys like chime in and say shit

2110
06:03:29,450 --> 06:03:37,900
and it's fun it's funny i don't think this will stop but i will definitely be putting more time

2111
06:03:37,900 --> 06:03:52,919
and effort into that other side really depending on how well this stream is received will be an

2112
06:03:52,919 --> 06:04:03,619
indicator of how hard i want to pursue continuing down that road which i think i i i really don't

2113
06:04:03,619 --> 06:04:18,340
see how this wouldn't be a really fun stream we'll see but thank you thank you apple ship of the 250

2114
06:04:18,979 --> 06:04:24,630
hey man this is gonna be sappy uh but you're kind of the best thing that's happened to my mental

2115
06:04:24,630 --> 06:04:29,830
health in a really long time and i want to say thank you for that your old tf2 commentary videos

2116
06:04:29,830 --> 06:04:35,430

2117
06:04:35,430 --> 06:04:39,990
sometimes but putting on one of those has been just what i needed recently sorry this is kind

2118
06:04:39,990 --> 06:04:43,349
of long but yeah you help a lot of people in a lot more ways than you realize have a good one

2119
06:04:49,349 --> 06:05:03,400
that's moving in a million ways that i can't even i can't even express i am so happy that people can

2120
06:05:03,400 --> 06:05:09,479
get much more out of this than simply just you know watch it and laugh and and then that's it

2121
06:05:18,619 --> 06:05:26,340
if this helps if it does i i i there's not much i can say i'm so fucking glad that you have

2188
06:17:52,389 --> 06:18:11,659
ready three two one let me tell you a sad story there was once a young boy who was not well liked

2189
06:18:12,819 --> 06:18:19,419
the older his friends became the more bitter his hatred escalated every day they were beaten up so

2190
06:18:19,419 --> 06:18:25,419
badly he lost half of his face his eyes were swollen shut and he was covered in bandages

2191
06:18:26,459 --> 06:18:31,340
to see how he really felt was beyond words and every time it seemed they could just keep going

2192
06:18:31,340 --> 06:18:37,740
the punishment would get worse one day a woman stopped in to buy some bread he didn't listen to

2193
06:18:38,299 --> 06:18:45,259
he didn't seem to care what then one day he walked right into her bedroom she screamed and ran out

2194
06:18:45,259 --> 06:18:49,740
screaming what the next morning she said to her parents i don't know what i did to him you're

2195
06:18:49,740 --> 06:18:58,380
useless he just stood there and didn't even move all the while the old man tried to comfort him

2196
06:18:59,369 --> 06:19:03,849
then one day there was some sort of accident a boy was playing with his friends and the big

2197
06:19:03,849 --> 06:19:10,709
wooden hammer fell on one of his friends and knocked him down as well at the hospital the

2198
06:19:10,709 --> 06:19:14,709
nurse looked on but still as she said not that bad and then something
