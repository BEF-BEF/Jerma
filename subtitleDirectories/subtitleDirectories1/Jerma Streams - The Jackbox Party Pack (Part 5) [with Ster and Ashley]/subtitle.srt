1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:19,899
Okay, hello. I had to take care of Otto. Kill him? Take care of Otto. This game's kind of loud.

2
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:33,479
There we go. All right, so what do you guys want to do? I don't know. Do you want to do? Oh,

3
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:45,000
we'll go open it. Open up my stream. I'm opening it. Okay. It's like you're getting tea. Not for

4
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:48,420
mine. Mine won't start for some reason.

5
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,010
Well, it's a good to do window capture or fuck it. We'll just do this.

6
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:20,500
It's already here. All right, so we have trivia murder party. A serial killer is running an absurd

7
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:27,129
trivia game out of the family run murder hotel he grew up in. Can you survive? Role models. Excuse

8
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:34,420
me. Did you say family run murder hotel? Yes, that is that is correct. That is role models.

9
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,099
Everybody's somebody. So who are you? The planner, the flake, the sassy one.

10
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:47,299
Step into the lab and find out. We just do them all. Let's start a trivia murder party too. All

11
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:55,000
right. Trivia murder party too is what we're starting with. Wait, it's coming. I'm going to

12
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:11,460
give you guys. I'm going to tell you guys the secret code. Oh, if it'll load. Is it going to

13
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:21,849
load? There we go. All right. I need to set up some stuff. Audience full screen. Turn it down

14
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:27,909
a little. That's it. Could be a little loud. All right. Now I have to do this. I do the hide

15
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:37,830
subtitles. Max players. Eight room code hiding. I got it. Don't worry. Okay.

16
00:02:38,789 --> 00:02:45,909
Filter US centric questions. Reduce the number of US questions. What? Why? Require Twitch.

17
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:59,960
Require players to be logged into Twitch. I kind of need the tutorials. I don't need extended

18
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:09,699
timers. Okay. So now this thing is, let me just do this for a second. Hold on. Hold on. Everybody,

19
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:14,500
everybody relax. Okay. I'm going to run bathroom. Go to the bathroom. Go to the bath. Go get tea.

20
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:28,060
Cause something, something's messed up over here. I need to look at this. This shouldn't be doing

21
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:52,819
this. What's going on? Turn that off. Why is it doing this? So is this trivia about murderers

22
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:58,900
or are they going to murder us if we get them wrong? This trivia is about surviving. I don't

23
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:10,409
know. I'm bringing up murderpedia just in case. Is that being captured? It's glitching out of it.

24
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:14,360
All right. I think I got it. I got it. I got it. All right. That should be fine. All right.

25
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:24,470
Let me make sure this is going to work. All right. I have a room code here for you guys in a second.

26
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:33,910
In just a moment when he's ready. I got to break this down. So then I can put it in the discord.

27
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:44,579
This code is going to be in the sub discord. Those of you subs, it's going to be there in

28
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:55,449
just a second after they get it. I'm ready. He's done. I will just tell you what it is.

29
00:04:55,449 --> 00:05:01,819
Wait, is he streaming still? No, no. All right. I'm going to mute and I'm going to tell you what

30
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:07,339
it is. Are you ready? Where do we type it in? I was in the back. You go to jackbox.tv

31
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:21,339
and you are going to write in the room code. Okay. Ready? Yes. I'm about to mute.

32
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:28,759
But I have to get in first here. The code is I remember this. I have to get in first

33
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:37,100
like on my phone. I have to get in. I remember the shit. Well, like another browser, right? Yeah.

34
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:42,759
I fucked this up last time we did this. They would try. They've nobody said anything

35
00:05:42,759 --> 00:06:02,410
trying to get me to fuck this up. All right. The code is. Okay. Room requires Twitch login.

36
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:08,699
Yeah. You have to be connected to Twitch. Yeah. You're not. Yeah. I got it. Yeah. You did. There's

37
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:13,500
a little dropdown that says Twitch. You clicked a little top left dropdown and click on the Twitch

38
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:19,579
button and you should be able to log in. Yeah. Okay. Now what was the room password? The room

39
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:39,560
password is going to work. I'm in. So now, Hey discord, Hey discord, you're going to want to

40
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:46,889
type in. Here we go. Same joke again. Yeah. You'd be doing the same thing again. Just the same joke

41
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:58,980
again. Go for it. That's all I have. Some people have gotten in. Bye. And there's still some slots.

42
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:10,490
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. No, there's not. Join it. There was like a little

43
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:21,220
bookshelf thing. MCFN on jackbox.tv. You can participate in the game. Oh, your little dude

44
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:32,730
looks like Easter. Like a total nerd. Ready? Everybody's in. Okay. Sit back and relax. Where's

45
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:59,290
the everybody's in button? All right. We've got MCFN join it. What about me? Yeah. I feel like

46
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:04,250
my browser is in control of this because I'm the one that enabled it to start and I have a skip

47
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:10,089
button for this. I think, yeah, you are. I don't know how I got VIP. You got VIP because you got

48
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:17,689
in first and I didn't. As long as one of us is out there. Okay. Oh yeah. I'm in control.

49
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:32,070
This is your wake up call. Welcome to Trivia Murder Party. Those free vacation coupons you

50
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:37,190
received in the mail were a trick luring you into a game with deadly consequences.

51
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:50,149
How are there 4,700 people in the audience and 3,500 people watching? What is going on?

52
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:54,149
Whose memoir is titled? Is everyone hanging out without me?

53
00:08:55,110 --> 00:09:02,139
Use your device to answer the question. Whose memoir is titled? Is everyone hanging out with me?

54
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:09,179
Who are these people? I know who. Two of these people. I know one.

55
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:21,000
And we die if we don't answer this. In the correct answer. Who got the question right?

56
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:29,990
I got that wrong. The rest of you come with me. American questions off. Why would we do this?

57
00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:36,870
The three of us are Americans. I don't want to be American. The hairdryer is broken. Sorry.

58
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:43,830
I can't believe there's 7,000 people in the audience. I know. This one's real straightforward.

59
00:09:44,629 --> 00:09:51,029
A player who rolls the highest will die. What? But we've got some help to make this more interesting.

60
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:57,450
You have an extra die that you can give to whoever you want to make their odds worse.

61
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:06,740
I didn't know who wrote that memoir. Oh shit. I need to read more books. Well, good luck, Star.

62
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:17,220
More celebrity memoirs. The player with the highest total dies. Oh no. Awesome sauce is dead.

63
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:33,909
That's the worst way to die. Kill bonus. Holy shit. Wow. We have 15,000 people in the audience today.

64
00:10:33,909 --> 00:10:39,190
Don't freak out. But you're a ghost now. Keep playing and you just might steal some

65
00:10:39,669 --> 00:10:48,470
life force and win the game. Oh, by the way, the audience is a player. Now you can join

66
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:53,909
the audience. Whatever. It's like super low pressure. This is just fucking up everything.

67
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:05,259
Let's keep moving. Did I not get name dropped in the song? Oh, I know this one. I know this one.

68
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,299
I heard that shit. I know the song.

69
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:32,340
Do I get points for answering it instantly? Time's running out. I don't even know who made

70
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:38,259
this song or what the song is. It's like a song for a Girl Scout camp. It's like a little kid song.

71
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:45,879
Oh, I got it wrong. Fuck. Why do I know this? Because I have a shitload of nieces and nephews.

72
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:53,460
I hope you're good with instructions. Follow as many rules as you can before time runs out.

73
00:11:54,100 --> 00:12:01,899
The player who follows the fewest rules correctly dies. The rules are already on your device. Go,

74
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:10,980
go. The most disobedient player dies. Star, what's going on, Star? Star, what are you doing?

75
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,820
I'm so confused. There's not a lot for me to do during this game.

76
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:33,379
I guess I'll update my LinkedIn account. Almost out of rules time. Star, I didn't realize it was

77
00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:54,629
timed. I didn't realize. I voted for Star. I wrote this next question just for you. If you get it

78
00:12:54,629 --> 00:13:00,389
right, I will punish everyone else. Wait, what? Where do I keep more than half my bones?

79
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:05,350
How come this person gets to punish everybody? And I guess the audience can answer too.

80
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:11,750
What, me old bones? What are these questions? I think you have to pay attention. I think he

81
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:16,549
said like a line. Well, I have to stream mute it because then I'll hear myself. This isn't fair.

82
00:13:16,549 --> 00:13:27,240
Time's almost up. I can't do like a delay. Did you get the question right?

83
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,620
You succeeded. There's subtitles. I can't read. The rest will suffer.

84
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:41,740
Yeah, I got subtitles on. Oh no. It's the classic game Chalices. I've given each safe player a

85
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:50,950
poison pellet. Pick a chalice to drop your poison in. What do you mean? This is freaking me out.

86
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:02,490
Now it's your turn to play. Pick a chalice to drink from. Oh no. Drinking from a cup with a

87
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:08,970
poison pellet will kill you if you trust doctors. Drink, drink, drink. Yeah, I mean you have to go

88
00:14:10,409 --> 00:14:17,960
now. Let's see what everyone drank. A big skull. Yeah. No, I'm not going to put the poison in the

89
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:30,379
skull. That's too obvious. You know, that's why I clicked. I'm safe. A clever. It was too obvious.

90
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:34,460
That's why I didn't poison it. Why there's 17,000 people in the audience game part?

91
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:38,059
Because somebody has like four computers turned down and they're going to burn down their house.

92
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:43,980
Next question. Yeah, bot farm. Bot farming there is somewhere. What's inside a down comforter?

93
00:14:43,980 --> 00:15:00,149
I don't know. That's a pretty easy question. Cigarette butts. It's not even out.

94
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:19,850
Who picked this? Everybody. One of you is still alive. Packing peanuts. What's the significance

95
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:25,049
in me being dead? I can't play anymore. I think you can influence the game. Ah, the lost art of

96
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:32,250
letter writing. I'm going to dictate a message to you. Write down as much of what I say as you can.

97
00:15:33,049 --> 00:15:37,929
Everyone else will be typing too. And if anyone does a better job than you, you die.

98
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:47,769
Get ready. What are we doing? Starting letter now. Dear local action news team. Do you take requests?

99
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:54,409
I would like to see more of this future story. What are we doing? That share positive images.

100
00:15:54,809 --> 00:16:00,250
And last segments about the crimes that I have committed. What's happening? Just wait. Viewers

101
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:09,750
are tired of all the sad stories I am directly responsible for. Okay. Time's up. Now let me just

102
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:14,230
see what we have here with a quick scan. What's the result? No, you tricked me. You were supposed

103
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:17,830
to type out what that said. But did anyone do better than you? We were supposed to type that

104
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:24,330
whole thing out. You got outperformed. That's not even close to what I said. Again, I can't hear

105
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:39,190
anything that's being said on the screen. I hear this guy talking. Oh God. It's all right. I'm

106
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:49,669
still doing all right. Dead last. We're good. Let's try another one. I like what has three hearts.

107
00:16:50,789 --> 00:16:53,909
You could be good on that one. You guys confused me so I stopped.

108
00:16:54,710 --> 00:17:08,970
This is a trick question, I think, is it? Almost out of time. A lobster doesn't want lobster.

109
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:26,809
This. I want to show you something. This is the one with the big creepy mirror.

110
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:33,750
The ghost of my aunt Mildred loves to write words on mirrors. Yeah. She has her own consistent

111
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:39,589
handwriting. Now aunt Mildred is going to write a different word. What? But so will everyone else.

112
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:44,230
Draw a word on the mirror and maybe you'll trick someone into thinking it's aunt Mildred's.

113
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:52,549
I let the drawing begin. What the fuck attention to draw word here and try to spot my auntie.

114
00:17:57,109 --> 00:18:00,470
Oh, I got it already. I got it.

115
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:08,789
Everyone's going to write some stupid nonsense words to choose from.

116
00:18:09,269 --> 00:18:12,549
Oh, I got it. Type the word that aunt Mildred wrote or you die.

117
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,579
You can tell because aunt Mildred did not write sucks. With the real aunt Mildred,

118
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:30,539
please stand up. Yeah, we're good. We're safe. Oh, you got it. Oh, man. Mirrors are such bad luck

119
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:40,730
for me. I wonder if this is more or less ghost than you find in most elevators. Makes you think.

120
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,980
Let's keep moving. I want a germa to die. According to his website,

121
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:56,299
what does my boy Bob Vila recommend I use to get the blood out of the lobby carpet?

122
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:02,059
This is this old house. This old house with Bob Vila. My father used to watch the show every

123
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:17,460
fucking day. Time's almost up. I don't think I got this right though. It feels like boomer questions.

124
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:29,990
It is. Who picked this? I was going to pick that too. Everyone is wrong. Time for consequences.

125
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:39,160
I'll remember that though. Yeah. Good advice. I have a lot of scratch tickets. What a quirky

126
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:44,200
last minute gift. Yeah, there's going to be a scratch and find three dollar signs to live.

127
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:49,319
Do you want me to screen share to you on discord? I'll give you cash for every dollar sign you find.

128
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:55,240
But if you scratch off even one skull, you die. If it doesn't mess you up. Shouldn't. I'm reading

129
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,079
get to scratching some titles and everything now like a good boy.

130
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,220
Come on, you could scratch more. Oh, I think I'm dead.

131
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:20,619
I already scratched. What? The contest is almost over.

132
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:33,190
How the fuck did you do that? That's bullshit. No way. No way. You've got. That's wall.

133
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:42,940
Act. You're all dead. Only one of you is still alive. I'm dying too. It makes it better.

134
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:57,700
Now, let me see if I can do this. Congrats on making it here. I'm going to give you a category

135
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:05,579
books written in the first person. Tap each answer that fits the category and then press submit.

136
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:15,210
Does that work? You just mute it. Time is almost up. It's really laggy. Let's see the right answer.

137
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:20,420
Yeah, too laggy. You move forward one space for each correct answer.

138
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:29,380
Yeah. Well, then I guess you guys can see the code. Did you think it was going to be just you?

139
00:21:30,579 --> 00:21:36,339
That's cute. If it goes, then they can try to escape and win the game.

140
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:42,740
Here's everyone's next question and they get a third chance to help them catch up to you.

141
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:50,460
Time is almost up. I think that's I think that's right.

142
00:21:51,500 --> 00:22:04,920
Comes the next question. Plagues of Egypt in the book of Exodus.

143
00:22:09,849 --> 00:22:23,289
Lightning. Zap. Yikes. There's a ghost right behind you.

144
00:22:23,529 --> 00:22:49,269
You're better than I thought. Closing in. Uh oh, here comes trouble.

145
00:22:52,380 --> 00:23:02,660
It's only darkness. Can't you land locations? Everybody knows that.

146
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:07,539
No, I don't. Everybody knows that out there. No such thing as peanut acres.

147
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:12,980
Of course peanut acres is real. It's the only one I didn't pick. How do you know?

148
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:20,980
You stole some yummy life for us. There we go. The darkness approaches.

149
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:37,059
Beyonce albums. I don't know. Only boomers would know any of this shit. I got them both fucking

150
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:53,819
wrong. No, I didn't. Another life force swap. Come on, Star. Stage names. Bingo.

151
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:16,200
What? That's Val Kilmer. It's not Val Kilmer. Metric system units of measurement. Oh no,

152
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:36,420
Americans. We're Americans. Time is almost up. Am I muted? I shouldn't be muted. Am I muted?

153
00:24:36,579 --> 00:24:43,930
No, I've been hearing you. Don't listen to her. Rise. Okay, now you're muted. What the

154
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:50,420
fuck is a sausage phone? A sauce-a-phone? Susophone. Oh, I thought it was sauce-a-phone.

155
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:57,140
Fuck, I'm gonna listen. You said sausage. Another life swap. Sauce-a-phone? I thought it was an A.

156
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:02,980
Where do you think you're going? You need a perfect answer for your final escape.

157
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:07,299
Oh, that's why I can't hear him. And that includes the third answer choice now too.

158
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:27,500
No, that wasn't Miss Melissa McCarthy. Yeah, somebody made it already. No, it's over.

159
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:46,839
Okay, apparently you just killed. All right. Awesome sauce wins. All right, that's it for that

160
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:51,880
one. That was all right. A little too draggy for me, in my opinion. I don't know about you guys.

161
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,710
I think I felt the same way about the last one too. I don't understand a single thing.

162
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:03,430
Wait, I think there should only be video game questions to cater to us, you know? Yeah.

163
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:07,910
Where's the questions like, you know, what character from The Legend of Zelda has

164
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:15,109
the biggest heart instead of which sea creature has three? You know, we don't. We all know that.

165
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:17,430
That's the question I liked, actually, because I got that one right.

166
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:22,789
Yeah, where's the video games only? All right, we're gonna do what's the one below it?

167
00:26:24,569 --> 00:26:28,970
At least like big fucking nerd questions. We need a new code just to be clear that you'd be

168
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:34,779
showing on screen. Yep. Okay, and you should join before me so that I'm not the master.

169
00:26:34,779 --> 00:26:39,259
That's what I'm gonna do. Role models. Everybody somebody. So who are you? The planner? The flake?

170
00:26:39,259 --> 00:26:46,700
The sassy one? Step in the lab and find out. I'm getting, okay, hold on. I'm getting a huge

171
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:54,859
amount of people are saying this one sucks. Okay, I like the sound of joke boat.

172
00:26:54,859 --> 00:27:00,380
This one is all this one is friends only. This won't work with chat. Oh, awesome sauce

173
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:05,180
because they won. Thanks for the 10 community subs. Fuck yeah. Yeah, when you win, you need

174
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:09,980
to give us money. It's not serious. Thanks a lot. I will do joke boat people saying joke boats like

175
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:14,140
the actual like the good one bro models, I guess is only with like people that are present.

176
00:27:16,099 --> 00:27:30,309
Oh, we'll try. Yeah, make sure this is set correctly. Plays eight subtitles on

177
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:34,309
allow room code hiding. Thank you. Twitch integration.

178
00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:41,380
Manual censoring. Yep. I don't want to have any fucking issues there.

179
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:56,200
Audience. Okay. All right. Twitch is required. Good to go. So I hold on. Let's see what happens.

180
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:04,869
I could do the same joke again. Welcome aboard. I'm Chuck Hull, your captain and

181
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:16,039
go ahead and sign in. We just joined first. And then I will just I'm just gonna. Oh, wait,

182
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:28,440
you guys can see this. Oh, yeah, don't go and don't come in yet. Anytime now. And hold on.

183
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:34,900
Why is it taking so long? What's wrong? Come on jackbox.tv servers. What's going on here?

184
00:28:36,009 --> 00:28:44,420
All right, I am in. Oh, please. Whenever you're ready.

185
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:54,519
I beat you. How did you beat me? I beat you by a lot. Wait, why did you beat me? Okay, I got

186
00:28:54,519 --> 00:29:05,670
day discord. Wait, wait, make sure of actually gets in. Okay. Okay. Discord. Quick before the

187
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:23,289
ship leaves the dock. You ready? Here it comes. Fuck, I forget it. Hold on. It was literally four

188
00:29:23,289 --> 00:29:33,240
characters. Let's move it, people. Yeah, our character portraits are mixed up. What are you

189
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:39,240
talking about? I look like you. You look like. I don't know. Ashley has pigtails for sure.

190
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:50,099
One more person. Come on. And then I'm I look like Ashley Lang. All right. Oh, please. Here we go.

191
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:55,720
You're ready. Everybody's in. Everybody is in. There's the code on the screen. Join the audience.

192
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:06,380
This is the joke factory. Whatever. I don't even know what it's called. I get it. Get it.

193
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:17,369
Here's tonight's itinerary. We're going to write some jokes and then test them out on stage. But

194
00:30:17,369 --> 00:30:23,769
first things first, it's brainstorming time. Before we jump into the jokes, let's do a little

195
00:30:23,769 --> 00:30:29,369
writing exercise to get inspired on your device. You'll be prompted to write various topics like

196
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:34,329
animals, people or objects. Fill in whatever you think has a lot of comedic potential.

197
00:30:34,329 --> 00:30:40,410
If another player uses one of your topics in a short, you'll get a bonus. Bobby, generate as

198
00:30:40,410 --> 00:31:24,059
many as you can. You have 45 seconds starting now. Great joke topic. This writing exercise is

199
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:35,400
ending soon. Follow the steps on your device to write two jokes. I did so bad. Trust your

200
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:41,529
instincts. Okay. Yeah. None of mine were funny. No. Okay. Hold on. Complete the jokes on your device.

201
00:31:47,319 --> 00:32:00,940
Okay. Um, this is, how, how can I make a punchline from this? I can't think with you talking.

202
00:32:02,569 --> 00:32:05,289
If I'm ever going to be a comedy writer, I have to fucking nail this.

203
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:28,940
There's a joke for me button. Please make it funny for me. I, but this is the, this is,

204
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:35,700
uh, God damn it. I have to do this. I have to do this.

205
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:40,039
We're going to find out if you're a real comedian or not right now. You'll find out.

206
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:45,819
This is your legacy. Yeah. No, no. Fuck. I shouldn't have done that.

207
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:49,740
I want to redo on mine. I didn't realize I had another minute.

208
00:32:51,930 --> 00:33:00,759
Now we're talking to comedy. Oh my God. Damn it. I want to redo. I'm done with my jokes. You guys

209
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:05,480
done? Yeah. That's why, like I, I don't have a timer in my window, but if I realized it was

210
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:12,039
like 50 more seconds, I would have thought. Oh, we have 50 more seconds. Shit. Yeah. I thought

211
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:27,930
it was a race. I want to, can I go back? Joke boat. Captain, let me in. Oh, the time pressure was

212
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:32,170
like happy music in the chat, like scrolling so fast. Yeah. And Jeremiah talking about his,

213
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:36,490
his life story. Mute me, mute me, mute me. I thought I had like 10 seconds.

214
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:43,849
I did not write poop for the record. Here we go. You ever notice how cruise line captains drive

215
00:33:43,849 --> 00:33:50,890
like this, but barge captains drive like this? No. Okay. Here's our first comment. I apologize

216
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:59,750
for my joke already, even though, you know, it's exactly, here we go. Remember to say your catch

217
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:14,500
phrase. A group of spoons walk into a bar and pee pee poo poo. No way. No bubble wrap.

218
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:25,190
You got to read it. What does perform the joke mean? I guess you've just, I don't know. Just do it.

219
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:33,369
Oh, the buttons went away. I'm so dumb. I thought rap songs were good. Okay.

220
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:39,269
What? They call me DNA. What the fuck does that mean? That was pretty cool.

221
00:34:41,269 --> 00:34:54,940
Better joke. Look now. Well, I really don't want to compete with pee pee poo poo. It's impossible.

222
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:59,420
You can't compete with pee pee poo poo. You know, you're talking about Twitch chat.

223
00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:07,340
You lost. Whoa. It like rap. That's what it is. You hit them right in the field. They're like,

224
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:13,980
to you. Wait, you got a bonus? Get that lights mattering of a pause going.

225
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:21,960
I call my bedrooms a hell because I'm Satan.

226
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:44,260
My love life is like Napoleon. They always run away. Not your dad's compact car. What?

227
00:35:45,219 --> 00:35:50,420
This is catchphrase. Vote for your favorite joke now. I wish this was like the horror man.

228
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:57,300
So we get to vote which person dies. No, we're being thrown overboard in the end. I'm sure.

229
00:36:12,739 --> 00:36:20,019
Seven, 70. Our next comic needs an introduction. It's me versus you. My jokes aren't jokes.

230
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:28,329
I'm a nasty little dry erase board because I'm soaking wet.

231
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:47,079
Who ordered the flight attendant? I thought it was going to be me. Don't worry. They're all

232
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:51,159
going to vote for you anyway. I'm going to open up a store that only sells walruses and call it

233
00:36:51,159 --> 00:37:04,360
Walrus Mart. Don't get your strong. Can you explain the joke? How do you not get mine? It's

234
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:13,320
the perfect setup. It's like a perfect setup. But you're a dry erase board. Don't you get it?

235
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:23,539
No. I don't have to spell it out for you? Yeah. The one on the right just added

236
00:37:23,539 --> 00:37:30,059
March to the word Walrus. Yeah, but at least it's made sense. And a tip of the hat to you.

237
00:37:30,059 --> 00:37:41,610
What the fuck? Here's another comedian whether you like it or not. I like my friends like I like

238
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:47,619
my cars. Oh, it's a bitch. This one's going to damage your windows. It's just compacting it.

239
00:37:50,840 --> 00:38:00,949
This whole bit is compact cars. Every joke, the punchline is compact cars. Why are they called

240
00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:14,500
flat earthers and not should be called flat scurfers? Is that your seat? No, I haven't like

241
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:19,219
bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro has gone twice. I haven't gotten up on the stage once. I'm scared.

242
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:28,630
I'm going to vote for the compact car comic is better. Sorry, German. I just like the theming.

243
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:37,670
What was it? Is it his theme? It's not really original. I mean, he's winning.

244
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:43,639
And how about some points for you? Would you guys know the jackbox meta? Whoever's live stream

245
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:49,719
is currently live streaming our next comedian. Just go after. Am I, am I allowed to tell my

246
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:55,320
jokes? Tell them. What are you talking about? They're not other like they just keep calling

247
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:59,400
people up and I'm like, you're doing so bad and you're so comfortable. Okay. We didn't have

248
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:12,619
hashtags at tic tac toe. That is very boomer joke. There you go. Here's yours. Oh God. Oh God.

249
00:39:13,659 --> 00:39:21,780
I'm not ready. I'm scared. Go after all that. I'm voting for you, baby. You ever notice how Mr.

250
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:29,909
Peanut looks like a peanut in a suit? If you win and I, if I lose,

251
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:43,099
it's a comedy error. People think that's funny. People, people are saying that that was a funny

252
00:39:43,099 --> 00:39:52,619
joke, but my joke that had like setup and new ones. I'm just also, he's not in a suit. That's

253
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:58,619
right. I'm so brilliant compared to German. Thank you. Thank you. My adoring crowd.

254
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:06,380
Folks put your hand and hook together for our next comedian. Oh, they want me back.

255
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:15,099
Encore. They say encore. Give me a break. Have you heard about the big bad wolf challenge?

256
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:21,590
It's where you exercise till you puff and puff. That's, that's as bad as mine was.

257
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:28,469
That's actually the auto-generate joke. You, what? You hit the auto-generate button.

258
00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:33,510
I thought I had 10 seconds. Oh my God. I honestly thought if I didn't type it in the next three

259
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:40,389
seconds, it was going to do nothing. They turned on you. They turned on you real quick. Okay.

260
00:40:53,349 --> 00:40:58,070
Yours was auto-generated. So I have to pick the other one. I still pick the AI over a joke

261
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:05,940
that bad. That's like when like robots are going to take over the world and you're letting them.

262
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:13,059
Wait, no, you wait. Yes. Which one is better for me? It even tells you joke for me.

263
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:23,079
Joe, please joke for me. What a fraud. It was the time. I don't even, I don't remember

264
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:27,239
what my other one was. Let's keep things going for the next comedy. Okay. We're playing this game again.

265
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:32,840
Yeah. Now that we all understand, I'm not going to let this smug ass parrot.

266
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:40,619
My family is like Bigfoot. Don't photograph well. Is that auto-generated?

267
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:49,420
Yeah. That seems, that seems like a joke for me. All right. German is going to take them down.

268
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:53,420
Here we go. The big reveal. Let's go. If people think this, whatever.

269
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:59,019
Hello. My doctor said I have a bad case of the soap operas

270
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:02,820
because I'm the cleanest I've ever been.

271
00:42:16,489 --> 00:42:23,670
It wasn't an auto joke. Well, that's, I guess I have to pick it. No, it tells you after the vote.

272
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:29,670
I think if it was. What? Yeah. It's stamped it after. That was a joke for me. Yeah. You guys

273
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:35,750
voted for the auto joke. Your doctor says you have a bad case of being clean.

274
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:41,909
A bad case of being cleaned. That's the point. I can't make some noise for our next comment.

275
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:53,929
I don't choose the prompt. You did get to choose the prompt in a way. What's the difference between

276
00:42:53,929 --> 00:43:03,699
most people and people and people has an end. Oh my God. It made no sense. I didn't pick the most

277
00:43:03,699 --> 00:43:16,420
people and people. Oh, she didn't get to pick the prompt. I didn't. It's very literal. He wrote

278
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:22,860
the word boomer. He wins. Man. First I compete against pee pee poo poo and now I compete against

279
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:28,539
boomer. So old I remember when Elbertson was a boomer. Click it. Everybody click it.

280
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:38,409
What? I forgive you though, Ashley, because you had my top joke of the entire thing which was

281
00:43:38,409 --> 00:43:47,849
I remember people. Thank you. I'm here for you. Oh my God. You won anyway. Nice assist. Assist.

282
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:55,820
Thank you, Chad. This is a horrible cut up. Let's see.

283
00:43:58,059 --> 00:44:00,380
Yeah, just wait for it to end too. Oh, I'm beating German.

284
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,179
Wake up screaming.

285
00:44:05,659 --> 00:44:14,869
Both of you. How about that?

286
00:44:24,139 --> 00:44:28,940
Well, we're sinking again. There's no time to write jokes from scratch. So here's the plan.

287
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:33,659
Let's rewrite another comics joke. You'll use the same setup, but we'll attempt to write

288
00:44:33,659 --> 00:44:39,099
a funnier punchline. The better the original joke did, the more points you'll earn for beating it.

289
00:44:39,099 --> 00:44:44,219
Can you steal the spotlight before the boat sinks? Let's find out. I think I understand.

290
00:44:45,179 --> 00:45:18,090
Okay. Wait. That was me. Mine was me responding to it. I'm sorry. I fucked it up. That was me

291
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:26,920
respond. Whatever. I can't believe I wasted my joke on this. Me too. I was like responding. Fuck.

292
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:36,780
Whatever. Okay. I need to be clear. When my joke comes up, it's not me telling the joke. It's

293
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:49,349
Dennis. It's a character thing. That still doesn't help. Hello. Is that your way to pass

294
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:56,809
off like an offensive joke or something? No. It's not me doing it. It's not me writing this.

295
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:15,820
It's my character saying this. I'm just waiting for the full redo. Well, full redo. We're going

296
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:34,630
to the next game after this. Here's the number one. What's the difference between most people

297
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:48,090
and people? Nothing is the same word, dummy. Oh no, he got scooped. Which version do you like

298
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:53,940
best? Obviously, and this is not fair to the original comedian because they have time to

299
00:46:53,940 --> 00:47:03,929
figure out what they want to say. Those seems lopsided. You can replace it. Also, like in the

300
00:47:03,929 --> 00:47:10,650
world of comedy, I just feel like bro Baruto just ripped off Ashley and he loses a lot of points

301
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:15,050
for even trying to reiterate on the joke. Oh, I still won. Yeah, through that guy. He just stole

302
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:21,369
your joke. Well, we're all stealing jokes here. Yeah, that's just not cool. Remember when that

303
00:47:21,369 --> 00:47:28,739
one comedian did that? My love life is like Napoleon. Significantly shorter than I would have

304
00:47:28,739 --> 00:47:58,150
wanted. A real clash of the titans. That's pretty good. Sorry. Sorry. I picked really bad nouns in

305
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:02,949
the beginning. One of the questions was two spoons walk into a bar. I got to take responsibility

306
00:48:02,949 --> 00:48:32,489
for writing the word spoon. I don't know. No, no, no, no, no. I'm going for Satan. That's way

307
00:48:32,489 --> 00:48:42,099
better. That little face. It's not me writing this. It's somebody else. They're both good.

308
00:48:42,099 --> 00:48:46,900
I've been watching it all the time and remembering how Dennis definitely is a serial killer. Yeah,

309
00:48:46,900 --> 00:49:00,630
you have to read it in his voice. No, well, don't worry. Okay. Let's all make fun of German

310
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:06,309
now. You're going to laugh at my joke. Why are they called flat earthers and not go read any book?

311
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:21,659
What do you think? That's the best one yet. I was merely responding. Maybe phase two of the

312
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:40,300
boat isn't that bad. You have some comedy. Any book. That's not a joke. That's just a harsh truth.

313
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:48,059
All right. Gurpers though. Come on.

314
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:53,500
Notice how Mr. Peanut looks like

315
00:49:56,019 --> 00:50:07,019
fancier German. No. What? Well, you said the name of the streamer. So I don't know. It's going to be

316
00:50:07,019 --> 00:50:29,300
tight. I wrote peanut. Oh my God. 4555. Oh, you beat the reference.

317
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:47,139
All right. My doctor said I have a bad case of the soap operas because he doesn't have a real

318
00:50:47,219 --> 00:50:53,659
me. You know what I mean? No, I didn't write, you know what I mean?

319
00:50:57,579 --> 00:51:02,519
I do that all the time though. You know what I mean? You guys know what I mean?

320
00:51:02,519 --> 00:51:09,239
I do that all the fucking time. What the fuck just happened? It added you know what I mean on

321
00:51:09,239 --> 00:51:12,579
the end because I didn't I'm still trying to

322
00:51:16,389 --> 00:51:21,849
people voted for it and that's that's even worse. Whoever you are, you're a hero to me.

323
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:30,150
And you know what? I got you more points. Thank you. I appreciate that. Just throwing throwing

324
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:37,429
I'm gonna ask you a little dry erase board because dear God, this joke is so bad. I can't even save

325
00:51:37,429 --> 00:51:49,139
it. What's not to understand? Explain it. I can't. I'm not going to explain this. I'm a nasty dry

326
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:57,940
erase board because right, but you can't be a dry erase board if that's why that's the joke because

327
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:07,610
it's it's it's sexual. I didn't pick. How am I going to explain this? I mean, I get where you're

328
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:16,840
going, but it doesn't make any sense. It's like it doesn't work. Oh, he beat you. I wasn't expecting

329
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:34,340
that. I like my friends. I like my cars. Rumors only. It's gonna be tough. We've got two stream

330
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:51,699
references. Compact guy is the original car jokesman. It's pretty split. No, that was pretty close.

331
00:52:52,099 --> 00:53:06,900
Which comedian is leaving with me in the lifeboat? Let's find out who deserves it the most. That's

332
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:20,809
kind of scary. Wow. Okay, we actually if we voted against compact car guy, then German would have

333
00:53:20,809 --> 00:53:35,989
won. Yeah. Well, that was fun. All right. Let's go to the next one. We can do it again. We'll do

334
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:39,349
we'll do this one again like after we go. We need the redo new players.

335
00:53:40,469 --> 00:53:47,179
Hold on. Wait. Whoa. Whoa. I'm in control. Oh, yeah, you are in control. Oh, well, I just get

336
00:53:47,179 --> 00:53:52,059
I click the board and I'm Chuck Hall. I'll be your host tonight. Tell me what you're doing.

337
00:53:52,059 --> 00:53:58,650
I'll behave. All right. Don't do it yet. Let me don't like don't even press the button.

338
00:54:06,519 --> 00:54:14,679
Toot toot. We got a scoot. Everyone, you know, think of some funny nouns like boomers and, you

339
00:54:14,679 --> 00:54:20,539
know, excellent, which means a toot. Yeah, that's that's good. All right. Join a poopy

340
00:54:20,539 --> 00:54:29,829
pee pee poo poo. Join it. And then when you're in, put it in the discord. We don't have all day.

341
00:54:30,869 --> 00:54:40,440
Ashley's in. And so is star. Okay. Now, let's put this in the discord.

342
00:54:42,179 --> 00:54:50,659
Ashley changed. We all change bodies. This is how it was supposed to be. Just like in try. We don't

343
00:54:50,659 --> 00:55:11,190
have all day. Bagel boy. My more. Oh, oh, okay. I just realized. Okay. Derma put. Derma put what?

344
00:55:11,989 --> 00:55:19,159
Anytime now. Come on in, everybody. Derma puts what? Well, you need to click. Everyone's ready.

345
00:55:20,139 --> 00:55:23,420
I know you got max players. Just making sure because you haven't done it yet.

346
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:30,380
I got you. You better not talk to me once. I gotta get everyone. This is writer's room.

347
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:37,179
Silence. Quiet chat. Derma put sun chips in F tier. Let me ask both of your questions really quickly.

348
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:46,539
Are sun chips good? Would you pick sun chips? Comedians. Here's tonight's itinerary. Yada yada.

349
00:55:46,539 --> 00:55:50,219
Moving on. Okay. There we go. Star.

350
00:55:50,219 --> 00:56:27,960
Star. Really? Okay. I guess it makes sense. Just like my premium cable bundle, this writing

351
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:38,550
exercise is ending soon. All right. Now it's time to write some comedy. Follow the steps to construct

352
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:50,840
two jokes. Oh, I forgot to do minus two. Nobody did anything. You talked about sun chips. Oh,

353
00:56:50,840 --> 00:57:00,760
I said the word sun chip. Yeah. I ain't picking that one. Oh God. I should not have picked this.

354
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:07,079
The only jokes I can think of are very bad. Don't stop it. Very bad. Don't get out. I will. I will

355
00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:12,039
censor your joke. I'm not doing it, but I just like, I, I am in a situation now where there's,

356
00:57:12,039 --> 00:57:16,920
this is very difficult to not make this. Don't do it. Awful. Don't do it. Do something. Skip.

357
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:38,360
Do something else. Oh God. I'm sorry. You, I fucking around. I will actually boot you from

358
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:45,739
this call and I will boot you from this. I will censor you. I'll do it. Don't make me do it.

359
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:52,489
I'm going to do a joke. Okay. You should be starting on your second joke soon. If you

360
00:57:52,489 --> 00:58:08,889
haven't already. I, what am I going to write for this fucking thing? Oh yeah. This is also awful.

361
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:19,849
This isn't like bad. Awful. This is, uh, just, I, I, uh, whatever. I don't care.

362
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:43,750
Uh, these are, these two are such bad prompts. Um, time's running out. Submit what you can.

363
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:56,469
I don't know. Whatever. I don't, whatever. I don't care. Mine are terrible. Looks like some

364
00:58:56,469 --> 00:59:01,429
of you didn't finish your jokes too bad. God, this is going to be worse than the first one. I

365
00:59:01,429 --> 00:59:07,750
can just feel it. I am ready. I'm ready to fucking get ready. Wow. Talk about close

366
00:59:07,829 --> 00:59:11,510
quarters. Why are all the setups the same again? Dang it, Chuck. You screwed it up again. I got

367
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:24,070
like the exact same one. Here's our first comic. How many boomers does it take to change a light

368
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:32,340
bulb? Three. One to screw it in and two to complain about millennials. Is that auto generated?

369
00:59:33,219 --> 00:59:36,900
That, that is, it's definitely not, but that's so bad. It's an auto complete.

370
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:40,599
That's a spicy controversy.

371
00:59:42,599 --> 00:59:48,260
What's the difference between most people and sheep? Most people have their own opinions.

372
00:59:56,500 --> 01:00:07,110
Okay, judges, render your verdict. He told it backwards. Well, you don't, you don't get to

373
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:24,599
choose the first half of your joke. I don't even have a choice. I do believe you're owed some points.

374
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:29,880
Why? Because why boomers? I don't understand. A round of applause for our next comedian.

375
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:35,480
Hi, Jeremy. You're muted. Why do you keep doing that? Wait, what? Cause the letter L.

376
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:39,000
I'm so old. I remember when Doopey. Doopey?

377
01:00:45,019 --> 01:00:49,659
It asked me to type in a player's name, a person's name and I got confused and I wrote Doopey for a

378
01:00:49,659 --> 01:00:54,780
person and then he picked that one. Doopey. Oh, that's your fault. Yeah, that's my fault.

379
01:00:55,420 --> 01:01:01,940
I love this. Yeah, these are the worst things I've ever thought of.

380
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:14,099
Marriage is a lot like, you know what I mean? I mean, that's funny in its own way, but I don't

381
01:01:14,099 --> 01:01:24,550
want to, I don't want to, you know what I mean? God damn it.

382
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:40,250
It's so funny. You know that there's something wrong when, you know, this is like random chat

383
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:45,369
members here that could write crazy shit and I'm concerned about the guy in the call writing the

384
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:52,219
crazy shit. You're going to read my joke. I was going to write gross. You got to write shit.

385
01:01:57,179 --> 01:02:02,280
Oh, I'm fine. I don't know where he got it.

386
01:02:05,110 --> 01:02:19,960
I thought mice were a bowl of feeling love. That's just not true. That's just not true.

387
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:41,960
Is this like a furry thing? Trucks. Imagine fighting the truck punch line.

388
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:52,119
Yeah, you got, you got to go to jackbox.tv and then put in the code. H J I I.

389
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:56,039
All right. Let's hear it for the next performer.

390
01:02:56,039 --> 01:02:58,599
I hope I'm up against you. I'm going to take you down.

391
01:02:58,599 --> 01:03:01,079
It's, it's guaranteed to win. I'm guaranteed to win because you just got,

392
01:03:01,079 --> 01:03:05,559
I'm going to just censor yours. So it's okay. Oh yeah. Don't forget to say your catchphrase.

393
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:10,760
This is bad. I didn't have any time. Why did the weighted blanket cross the road?

394
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:18,019
It didn't. It's a weighted blanket. Oh my God. I had, I was too busy. Look,

395
01:03:18,099 --> 01:03:24,420
oh my God, I was too busy yelling at you to not be offensive on stream.

396
01:03:25,219 --> 01:03:33,139
I wasn't. We were typing. My joke was very appropriate. Um, in good taste.

397
01:03:34,579 --> 01:03:39,780
I have more convertibles than a person who thinks rain is a myth.

398
01:03:42,139 --> 01:03:45,260
That's not very many people though. You don't have, you have like none. How many do you have?

399
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:52,860
Zero. Imagine when Jerma wins this one. Yeah, nice. They give him the softball.

400
01:03:56,219 --> 01:03:59,820
Oh, it's comedy battle night. Let's bring Jerma nine eight five up and his opponent,

401
01:04:00,539 --> 01:04:08,860
a beach ball. And that was, I still win. Oh, he was a joke for me. I still win.

402
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:26,570
Okay. Up next. Eagle boy. You had one zero so far. Let's see what you got now.

403
01:04:26,570 --> 01:04:36,440
My love life is like the Hulk. I feel nothing but frustration. Give me body wash.

404
01:04:42,949 --> 01:04:45,829
I don't know why it asked if you're ready. These are both very literal and

405
01:04:46,869 --> 01:04:50,309
just go. Just don't. It's just, you can explain the joke. It don't have to.

406
01:04:50,869 --> 01:04:54,389
My nickname is plunger because I love my work as a plumber. It's just

407
01:04:54,949 --> 01:05:05,659
I sent you up with a funny toilet object and you give me that.

408
01:05:06,539 --> 01:05:11,179
I was not at my attention. I don't have my full attention on the game. Did you? I wrote plunger.

409
01:05:12,219 --> 01:05:15,340
I wrote plunger. Did we both write plunger? I think we both.

410
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:23,579
Wow. All of the nouns in the world and we both picked plunger. Holy shit.

411
01:05:23,579 --> 01:05:30,940
Yes. Yeah. No. All right. So let me just, let me, I gotta defend myself.

412
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:37,420
During this, you were going during this whole time, you were going, Oh, I can't write this.

413
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:43,260
Oh, no, no, I'm going, I'm in trouble. Have you tried trucking? Have you ever tried trucking?

414
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:47,019
That's when you have given up. I gave up on the joke.

415
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:55,900
I got a stream to run and you're sitting there going, Whoa, this is going to get TOS.

416
01:05:57,639 --> 01:06:03,079
I want to open a store that only sells Cheetos and call it cheesy German bloomers are us. Well,

417
01:06:03,079 --> 01:06:13,820
fuck, I'm censoring you. Do you have a sensor button? Oh, he does. Oh my God.

418
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:17,900
Don't censor me. Oh my God. Ashley just keeps giving up.

419
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:29,019
Heck yeah. You better not censor mine. I'm going to censor it. This better not be bad.

420
01:06:30,469 --> 01:06:33,750
I'm going to be actually IRL upset. It's fine.

421
01:06:38,570 --> 01:06:41,449
That's where you be a white and don't bring one to school.

422
01:06:42,329 --> 01:06:53,239
Fuck. Get out of here. You're out. You're out. You're out. You're out. All right. Let's hear it

423
01:06:53,239 --> 01:07:04,150
for our next comedian. Me again. What? You both failed. My grandma said the best thing about

424
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:18,869
reality shows is that Bob Barker is freaking cute. No. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no,

425
01:07:18,869 --> 01:07:23,670
not another one. I want that. Wait, wait, this better be like, this better be like a knock,

426
01:07:23,989 --> 01:07:28,809
Joe. If this ain't like I'm an Asti little Rubik's Cube.

427
01:07:43,239 --> 01:07:46,280
You just got to censor everyone until you win and feel good about yourself.

428
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:52,280
Who is currently winning comedy? Let's see. Oh, who's winning comedy? I wonder. Oh,

429
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:57,239
third place. Look at me. This whole thing's rigged.

430
01:08:01,670 --> 01:08:09,900
All right. Here's where we're really bad. I got my finger on the button.

431
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:19,180
PG 13 and no offensive bullshit. Well, we're sinking again. There's no time. Okay. Yeah,

432
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:33,930
you keep swearing. You know the drill. Oh, no. These both of these setups are awful. I know.

433
01:08:34,810 --> 01:09:05,750
Uh, I love this one. That's terrible. Fuck. I can't admit it.

434
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:28,220
Germa is allowed to sexualize dry erase boards, but Kurt Starr can't make a sexy Rubik's Cube

435
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:38,020
joke. Exactly. Someone gets it. Get out of here. Germa was the original R rated Joe after your

436
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:46,899
first fucking material there. I had the, I, excuse me. Oh, we just pretending like the first one

437
01:09:46,899 --> 01:09:51,479
didn't exist. And German, you can't, I don't even hear you. You're muted again because you

438
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:57,960
typed an L. Well, you just turn on the stream. Women and children go in the lifeboats first.

439
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,680
Everyone else stick around and welcome back our performers.

440
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:05,989
What about the Bob? That was just accidental. I've deleted like 30 videos accidentally. I'm

441
01:10:05,989 --> 01:10:11,930
accidentally going to mute someone. Marriage is a lot like germs. It makes you sick.

442
01:10:12,970 --> 01:10:20,810
That's pretty good. That's a pretty good PG PG like 1950s comedy. Did they successfully beat this

443
01:10:20,810 --> 01:10:36,390
joke? You know what I mean? Marriage. It's the same joke, but just told differently. Yeah. That's

444
01:10:36,390 --> 01:10:51,500
the beauty of comedy. Oh yeah. You didn't do anything. I didn't do anything. All right,

445
01:10:51,500 --> 01:11:00,539
bagel boy. What do you got? I'm a nasty little tornado because I spin out of control. Like this

446
01:11:00,539 --> 01:11:15,939
game of joke boat has which punch line is better because I, Oh, he's up against that one.

447
01:11:17,699 --> 01:11:24,170
Because that's, that's, that could be stars joke. Number one that I censored could be one of the

448
01:11:24,170 --> 01:11:31,930
three I censored. No, no, he's like up against the AI. Yeah. Cause I deleted three jokes. Oh,

449
01:11:32,569 --> 01:11:38,569
Oh, so they don't even get to go up against mine again because I was censored that much.

450
01:11:39,289 --> 01:11:44,409
You got a double censored. Okay. So I just don't even exist anymore.

451
01:11:46,569 --> 01:12:03,829
You are like face down into water. He asked nicely. What? Kill him. That's way better than mine.

452
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:15,050
Okay. Star, you're going to be really bad in about probably one to two minutes. I think

453
01:12:15,930 --> 01:12:19,289
why? Cause you're going to censor me again? No, cause there's nothing for you to censor.

454
01:12:19,289 --> 01:12:23,130
There's nothing for me to censor, but you're going to be very upset about this in particular.

455
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:29,189
I'm just kind of seeing it already. Oh, you lost. Yeah. You're going to, you're about to be very

456
01:12:29,189 --> 01:12:37,930
angry. Did you just like take my joke and rewrite it? No. My love life is like the Hulk starts out

457
01:12:38,010 --> 01:12:41,689
small, but then it gets big and green. I should see a doctor.

458
01:12:45,539 --> 01:12:48,260
How come you get to keep writing sexual jokes? Yeah.

459
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:07,000
Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead. You can't, you can't. I, I have all the power. I have all the power. Yeah.

460
01:13:12,039 --> 01:13:16,920
He's a hypocrite. He's a hypocrite. Hypocrite. He's a fucking hypocrite.

461
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:25,909
Shut up. Silence. I just stood up for my fucking throne. You don't make me stand up from the

462
01:13:25,909 --> 01:13:31,750
throne. You better try trucking. That's when you and your truck friends all go to the bar. I like

463
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:48,039
that one. You? Well, it's better than mine. So quarantine. Jerry was going crazy from the power.

464
01:13:48,520 --> 01:14:00,630
I thought somebody went for me.

465
01:14:02,869 --> 01:14:10,949
He's rubbing his hands together. You heard about the jack box challenge.

466
01:14:13,319 --> 01:14:16,039
That's where you censor everyone's answers until you win.

467
01:14:18,359 --> 01:14:23,029
It's funny because it's true. Oh, I mean you asked for it.

468
01:14:27,779 --> 01:14:31,140
What? How? You're not supposed to be able to participate. What happened? What, what, what

469
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:38,100
madness is this? What? My power. I'm so dumb. I thought mice were. What happened to my power?

470
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:56,579
Laugh. I'm censored. Oh, no. He's just waiting till the last second. There was nothing to censor.

471
01:14:56,579 --> 01:15:02,550
I mean, you just said it. I didn't see how to do it. Funny callback though.

472
01:15:03,510 --> 01:15:15,619
Come on. Thank you. Thank you.

473
01:15:16,659 --> 01:15:25,699
Jerma is fucking shaking. Resisting the urge to censor. No, I got the way to blanket across the

474
01:15:25,699 --> 01:15:34,739
road any longer. You know what I mean? That's the best joke of the whole night.

475
01:15:36,899 --> 01:15:38,100
That's the best one of the whole night.

476
01:15:40,899 --> 01:15:45,380
But you know what I mean? Really? The end, the end really ties it all together. I think

477
01:15:46,020 --> 01:16:04,069
seriously. Perfect. Those. Hey, thanks. The 60 people that voted for me. You're loyal.

478
01:16:04,710 --> 01:16:10,149
I recognize that guy's name. 3% of you. You're loyal. I check you on the ballot. I knew it.

479
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:15,029
That is my King's God saving when the ship capsizes. Let's find out.

480
01:16:15,670 --> 01:16:28,619
Oh, dude. The best. Good job, man. I wish I would have gotten to participate.

481
01:16:30,939 --> 01:16:39,340
Because I wasn't censored. Yeah. Yeah, you're stupid. You flew too close to the sun.

482
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:46,310
You see how I got 97% of that vote? I did, but like, come on. All right, let's do another one.

483
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:58,359
Oh, freester. Let's do the one. No word. Censor it, dude.

484
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:12,250
Is this how the king dies? No, it can't be. I'm choking on my own water. All right,

485
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:17,529
what should we do? Push the button. Vocabulary game. Dictionarium. Humans have been inventing

486
01:17:17,529 --> 01:17:22,569
words and phrases for centuries. Now it's your turn to contribute an entry to the pages of the

487
01:17:22,569 --> 01:17:36,520
Dictionarium. This seems fun. Let's try it. Push the button is the best one. Okay,

488
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:41,529
we'll do it after this. What time is it for? Yeah, we've got like another hour or so.

489
01:17:42,170 --> 01:18:05,859
Like an hour and a half. Okay, archive. Am I allowed to play this one? Yeah, if you behave.

490
01:18:06,979 --> 01:18:10,779
All right, you just gotta promise me to not say anything sexual and I won't either

491
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:15,180
because you're the only one that can get me going like that. You know what I'm saying?

492
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:26,140
All right, that's enough. That's enough. King is spoken. You know, I don't want to be the king.

493
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:34,979
The king always just dies. Like it sucks to be the king. The king always loses always every time.

494
01:18:34,979 --> 01:18:40,970
Want to be the jack? I kind of just I want to be like the guy that makes the bread. That

495
01:18:40,970 --> 01:18:51,369
guy's life is always fine. Yeah, people always need bread. All right, so I have to get rid of

496
01:18:51,369 --> 01:19:04,579
this and don't go in yet. I know that you two are going to be raring to go, but hold on. Go ahead.

497
01:19:04,579 --> 01:19:21,510
Only win. Yeah, get in there. All right, discord. It's your turn. Come on in. Three, two, one. Here

498
01:19:21,510 --> 01:19:33,750
it comes. And now it shows up. Cool. Hey, everybody else. Go on if you want to.

499
01:19:42,739 --> 01:19:45,220
All right, we got it. All right, we got it. We got it. How do you boot?

500
01:19:46,180 --> 01:19:56,359
Can you? How do you keep? Can you? He got in fair and square. Do not censor him. Don't.

501
01:19:57,319 --> 01:20:00,539
There are thousands of people who want to play. All right, now you're going to make me look like

502
01:20:00,539 --> 01:20:09,140
the bad guy because let's go. Let's go. I'm not. I'm the bad guy. Bad guy. Bad baker.

503
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:15,140
Word game or slang phrase game?

504
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:25,939
What an intelligent crew in the dictionary. You will create a dictionary entry for a made up word

505
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:30,260
and you will win if your answers get the most votes. Oh, that's fun. Oh, P.S.

506
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:34,899
Feel free to join the audience. Enter the room code to play along. Let's rock.

507
01:20:38,039 --> 01:20:40,359
First things first. I am assigning you a word.

508
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:48,840
What do you think this word means? Write it down on your definition for the new word on your device.

509
01:20:52,579 --> 01:20:56,979
Fun fact. This word is banned for most aquariums. So we have to do definition for that word. All

510
01:20:56,979 --> 01:21:09,210
right. Let's see. We can't. As long as you're using letters, you really can't.

511
01:21:09,210 --> 01:21:17,430
Letters are disappearing. It's a timer. It's like a minute. I can't think of anything.

512
01:21:18,229 --> 01:21:21,590
I know it's hard. It really is hard to come up with like something like that.

513
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:37,319
Somebody throws at you. It would help if I know how to spell this word.

514
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:50,119
I mean, you got to submit very, very soon. Like right now. I don't know.

515
01:21:53,239 --> 01:21:57,079
I think everybody's reaction is always, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

516
01:21:57,079 --> 01:22:03,130
That's what the word means. I don't know. Show me the definitions.

517
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:26,550
Okay. The time has come to vote. Pick your favorite definition and quietly admire the rest.

518
01:22:27,510 --> 01:22:35,350
All these answers are terrible. And remember, you can award bonus points to the ones that

519
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:46,140
stole your heart. Are any of these like supposed to be correct? No, you can't be correct.

520
01:22:49,619 --> 01:22:56,579
It's not a real word. It's whichever one speaks to you. Come on, vote. What? It takes so long to

521
01:22:56,579 --> 01:22:58,819
decide. Oh yeah, but then we all have to vote.

522
01:23:06,569 --> 01:23:09,850
By the way, the official note take backs definition for the word is

523
01:23:11,210 --> 01:23:13,479
when you eat too many trains.

524
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:22,250
You go to bite your food and end up falling down the

525
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:28,489
train. To slowly stroke a chimp's hair, a loser chimp,

526
01:23:31,369 --> 01:23:38,090
but with an E, you know what I'm saying? No, we can't. No more. You know what I'm saying.

527
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:40,409
Definitions are like children. Pick your favorite.

528
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:10,170
A chump, but it's a chimp. Vote for your favorite before this is gone. Vote right now.

529
01:24:10,810 --> 01:24:15,369
Do you like the sentence where you're stroking your hair to chimp a chimp?

530
01:24:18,250 --> 01:24:22,810
That kind of pulls it together. The audience likes a loser. And the winning definition is

531
01:24:22,970 --> 01:24:38,579
I like it too. Nice job, Scoob. Stir. Yeah, 420. If you say that, you should get points deducted.

532
01:24:38,579 --> 01:24:44,579
I was waiting. Yeah, 420. Chomp, chomp, chomp. This dictionary is hungry for a synonym.

533
01:24:46,739 --> 01:24:51,220
Write down a new word, something that matches the definition on your device.

534
01:24:51,300 --> 01:25:24,069
Round two. Here we go. The time is slipping away, so submit your cinnamon.

535
01:25:35,539 --> 01:25:37,859
Choose the word that best fits the definition.

536
01:25:42,859 --> 01:25:51,270
Diaper monkey? You just added the word diaper.

537
01:25:53,100 --> 01:26:05,000
You can't improve on chimp. That's what I was saying.

538
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:09,239
Yeah, this is pretty good. It already is. Why would you ever use the synonym on it?

539
01:26:09,239 --> 01:26:20,939
That person should vote. And the winner is

540
01:26:20,939 --> 01:26:23,180
None of these are synonyms. Mine vote? What are you talking about?

541
01:26:30,899 --> 01:26:34,899
You know the drill. Vote on the word that best fits this definition.

542
01:26:35,939 --> 01:26:46,149
You eat too many trains. What am I looking at?

543
01:26:46,710 --> 01:26:53,029
It kind of sucks. I don't know what this means.

544
01:26:53,909 --> 01:26:59,350
Caboose, Caboose. Choo, choo, choo.

545
01:27:00,550 --> 01:27:04,550
That person did not know how to spell Caboose. Vote, vote, vote. Vote right now.

546
01:27:05,189 --> 01:27:09,989
Y'all are bad at this. How do you be good with like nonsense?

547
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:15,880
It's not even real. Boulder Dash gets the words in real.

548
01:27:16,039 --> 01:27:18,199
And the winning synonym is

549
01:27:21,539 --> 01:27:25,300
You know like when someone walks up to a comedian it's like oh you're a comedian tell me a joke.

550
01:27:27,220 --> 01:27:30,420
This is like doing that but also you have to use a word that doesn't exist.

551
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:32,579
Oh I feel that. I feel that.

552
01:27:35,739 --> 01:27:38,859
In round three you will use the word in a sentence.

553
01:27:38,859 --> 01:27:42,779
This is your last chance to add to the dictionary of entry so make it count.

554
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:47,300
Write a sentence using the word on your device.

555
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:50,420
That really is the equivalent of like going to like somebody's house that you're dating

556
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:53,060
and meeting their dad for the first time. It's like oh you're funny.

557
01:27:53,699 --> 01:27:57,140
Like you said tell me a joke son and you're like eating dinner.

558
01:27:57,140 --> 01:28:00,579
It's not a joke but also use it in a sentence with the word

559
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:05,060
Caboose crew. Tell me a joke son. I don't know. Put your fork and knife down.

560
01:28:06,100 --> 01:28:09,060
I'm gonna throw you out a couple of verbs. Give me a story.

561
01:28:10,220 --> 01:28:16,920
All right I heard a sentence. Wait this is more like choo choo stuff.

562
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:24,979
Die for monkey a lose. This is all wrong.

563
01:28:25,779 --> 01:28:40,890
That's not even if that's the wrong.

564
01:28:43,050 --> 01:28:46,090
That's the wrong means of transportation. Whatever.

565
01:28:50,020 --> 01:28:53,899
Oh man you never finish.

566
01:28:54,779 --> 01:28:56,939
Let us behold the sentences.

567
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:08,329
Near station order their biggest choo-bee but that's not but that's not an item.

568
01:29:08,970 --> 01:29:12,409
It's rename train gore to choo-bee in my what?

569
01:29:13,210 --> 01:29:16,010
Kevin was never allowed to play with the other chimps and it was resigned.

570
01:29:19,850 --> 01:29:23,289
What? Yeah that's like yeah where's mine?

571
01:29:27,029 --> 01:29:29,909
Where's mine? Train gore wins.

572
01:29:29,909 --> 01:29:42,140
I didn't censor anything. Like oh my god.

573
01:29:44,060 --> 01:29:48,659
I love this game. Do you? Yeah this one's good.

574
01:29:48,659 --> 01:29:53,619
But actually to be honest as much as this one kind of sucks,

575
01:29:54,819 --> 01:30:01,220
it's so much better than the haunted house thing. Yeah well yeah not hard.

576
01:30:05,989 --> 01:30:11,539
And the winning sentence is choo-bee my choo-bee.

577
01:30:13,060 --> 01:30:17,300
Die for monkey. Look at those monkeys son. Oh no that that's the die for monkey. What?

578
01:30:20,119 --> 01:30:23,319
They were both on the screen. Why is mine gonna be on here?

579
01:30:24,279 --> 01:30:31,000
Did you pick the wrong one too? Yeah what? See?

580
01:30:36,569 --> 01:30:38,729
It's fucked up man. It's fucked up.

581
01:30:40,010 --> 01:30:44,250
So wrong. Dude this chap looked down at the die for monkey.

582
01:30:47,210 --> 01:30:53,449
This is a verb.

583
01:31:04,649 --> 01:31:07,819
Who the fuck wrote this? Me.

584
01:31:07,979 --> 01:31:14,220
Me. You did? The choo-bee at the bus stop is mine. No. No I'm the comedian.

585
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:18,380
Which one are you laughing at? Even the chap looked down at the die for monkey.

586
01:31:20,060 --> 01:31:22,779
I thought you were laughing at mine. That was me.

587
01:31:23,979 --> 01:31:26,699
I know how to make my words. Yours didn't mean how is that possible.

588
01:31:28,699 --> 01:31:37,500
What a perfectly fun funky fresh dictionary entry. I'm in awe. Oh my stomach hurts.

589
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:40,380
Die for monkey. A loser chimp. Derive from chimp.

590
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:05,319
I just found the new word dancing naked in the darkness.

591
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:11,239
All right let's do push the button.

592
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:24,170
No end of the game songs. Not good ones. All right push the button. Okay.

593
01:32:24,170 --> 01:32:29,689
This one better be fun or I'm blaming you. Me? Dangerous.

594
01:32:29,689 --> 01:32:35,079
People said it doesn't work with random people. Oh. Everyone said this is the best one.

595
01:32:36,279 --> 01:32:40,659
Should we do a one like is it does it just work with the three of us? Oh no it doesn't.

596
01:32:40,739 --> 01:32:44,579
But people are saying it does. Does this work with three people?

597
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:56,840
Does not work with. Oh it has no audience. Oh we would need an extra.

598
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:02,359
Everybody somebody who are you? So wait what was wrong? We skipped this one. Why did we skip this

599
01:33:02,359 --> 01:33:07,560
one? Well the chat said it was dumb. Yeah the chat said the one was very dumb. Should we even just do

600
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:15,640
it? Just wait we have the pack. But it's dumb and those other ones are so fun. I want to do

601
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:20,939
Dictionarium again now that I understand what's going on. Okay can you guys like not

602
01:33:21,899 --> 01:33:27,180
define the wrong word and still win? There was two and one on the screen. I wanted to pick one of

603
01:33:27,180 --> 01:33:33,579
them. You could. You probably just picked the wrong one. We'll plan like another night where

604
01:33:33,579 --> 01:33:43,560
we can have like four or five people do it. I mean I'm certain Ronnie's not doing anything.

605
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:46,329
I just know.

606
01:33:49,460 --> 01:34:01,989
Do you think we could do that? Is he interested? I'm certain he's interested. There's two things

607
01:34:01,989 --> 01:34:13,109
I know about him. He's not doing anything and he's interested. Oh okay. It does work with chat.

608
01:34:13,109 --> 01:34:19,220
People are saying. Does that work? Well let's just try and see why it wouldn't. All right let's just

609
01:34:19,220 --> 01:34:24,899
see. What's the worst thing we could do is waste time? Summon Ronnie in the meantime. I don't know.

610
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:40,260
What is it? Let's see. You need like ten people. People are saying. Ten people? They said four to

611
01:34:40,260 --> 01:34:45,779
ten. It technically works but everyone needs to talk to each other really. Well I can call. I

612
01:34:45,779 --> 01:34:55,829
can add Ronnie if we really want him. Well let's just. Wait max players. What if I do okay four?

613
01:34:56,789 --> 01:35:10,779
Hide the room code. Censoring. Quiet twitch.

614
01:35:15,430 --> 01:35:20,140
I'm trying not to think about it. Ten sucks you guys are nuts.

615
01:35:21,659 --> 01:35:28,039
All right well it just is like Ronnie right? Did you like tell him? Yeah he'll yeah.

616
01:35:30,119 --> 01:35:34,600
If you just if he's just sitting right there then just yeah if you like told him hey let's play then

617
01:35:35,239 --> 01:35:42,760

620
01:36:05,930 --> 01:36:10,170
Can you see the webcam? Uh yeah yeah I'm looking at the screen right now.

621
01:36:10,170 --> 01:36:20,390
The screen grab. Let's say gross Fluter. Aw Fluter I love you. Get Kim. Kim is at work.

622
01:36:22,140 --> 01:36:36,250
Sorry guys. Imagine working. On a Sunday. On a Sunday. Get her anyways. What the fuck. All right

623
01:36:36,250 --> 01:36:43,590
let me get this set up. Manual censoring in case you know I have to do that. Room code hiding. Max

624
01:36:43,590 --> 01:36:49,829
plays four. I guess it really doesn't matter. There's this. All right here we go. Play. Push the

625
01:36:49,829 --> 01:37:12,279
button. I said cake throat. All right uh you guys can see the game right so all I have to do is

626
01:37:12,279 --> 01:37:21,399
this. Uh don't join it yet when they get in first. No although it really doesn't matter. It's just

627
01:37:21,399 --> 01:37:31,420
the four of us anyways. Just the four of us. You and I and I and I. Ronnie is fucking infected.

628
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:36,710
What? Uh it's making me twitch log in. How do I do that? Here we go. I'll log in real quick.

629
01:37:36,710 --> 01:37:47,300
Top left setting bar. Yeah yeah yeah. All right here we go. That was easy peasy. All right so uh

630
01:37:47,300 --> 01:37:54,199
I've we're gonna get a tutorial. We'll see how this works. Let's go. Everybody ready?

631
01:37:55,430 --> 01:38:09,579
Yep yeah this is MVM music. Oh this one actually is an animated background. That's cool.

632
01:38:09,579 --> 01:38:14,380
Sorry to interrupt your cryo sleep but I thought it worth mentioning that I your digital officer

633
01:38:14,380 --> 01:38:22,340
during emergencies or DOTI have detected an alien biorhythm on this ship and just as I suspected

634
01:38:22,340 --> 01:38:27,539
the aliens uploaded a virus which is slowly deleting my program. I'm here to guide you through

635
01:38:27,539 --> 01:38:34,760
if you'd like. Uh we should probably figure out what the hell to do. Uh guide me. Fill me dude.

636
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:40,680
I'm now initiating security protocol alpha bravo caret which is a series of tests designed to

637
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:50,329
evaluate your humanity and reveal any aliens hiding amongst you. I have determined that one of you

638
01:38:50,329 --> 01:38:57,300
is secretly an alien. Please look at your device and confirm your identity. Your device can tell

639
01:38:57,300 --> 01:39:03,220
you if you're a human or an alien but not the identities of your fellow players. I'm Satan.

640
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:16,699
Figure out who. But my calculations will have 12 minutes before I cease to be so I'd appreciate

641
01:39:16,699 --> 01:39:23,100
it if you could figure out who the alien is and then push the button. We're trying to be killing

642
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:31,210
each other. You will be our first captain. I have repurposed the ship's quarters into unique testing

643
01:39:31,210 --> 01:39:36,729
areas. I'm pretty proud of it. Choose an available room and your desired participants. Oh drawing

644
01:39:36,729 --> 01:39:43,829
quarters. You know what's going in there. Fucking artist. Uh let's break out the tablet. Get me in

645
01:39:43,829 --> 01:39:55,619
here. Wait don't invite Jerma. Hey. All the artists just gonna jerk off. The two artists

646
01:39:55,619 --> 01:40:01,220
join the drawing room. Yeah let's get drawing. Whoa there's so much dicks. Where's the fucking

647
01:40:01,220 --> 01:40:03,539
loud talking clown. The drawings are revealed.

648
01:40:08,310 --> 01:40:17,909
Oh I gotta get my tablet. What are you guys doing in here? Hold on how much time do we have?

649
01:40:18,789 --> 01:40:25,529
You got like 12 minutes before we all die. How much time do we have to draw? A minute a minute

650
01:40:25,529 --> 01:40:31,289
and a half. Okay because my tablet I'm trying to get it to work it's not working. I don't understand

651
01:40:31,289 --> 01:40:35,689
what I'm supposed to be drawing. It says a thing on top of your screen like above the drawing.

652
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:41,640
You will understand what I mean when I don't understand what it wants me to draw.

653
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:47,880
Get the hurry up button. But when do I hit the hurry button? If you're dawdling with your doodling

654
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:57,159
I can't tell who you're doodling. Go. I'm doodling. Doodles doodles doodles. Fast fast fast. Yes that

655
01:40:57,159 --> 01:41:19,420
is womp ronnie. It is the real womp ronnie. I did it. Okay what did you do?

656
01:41:28,020 --> 01:41:31,859
Okay sick. And the human prompt was

657
01:41:35,979 --> 01:41:37,899
and how did the subjects respond?

658
01:41:41,020 --> 01:41:47,020
Do any of these answers seem suspicious? Keep in mind someone may have gotten a bad prompt

659
01:41:47,020 --> 01:41:54,300
or they could just be a terrible artist. That's Sean Valjean if he was a um if he was a captain

660
01:41:54,300 --> 01:42:00,619
of enterprise. I think I think you know how we draw there's like that's how we both draw.

661
01:42:00,619 --> 01:42:03,819
We're not alien. What am I trying to pick here? You're trying to pick who the alien is

662
01:42:04,539 --> 01:42:11,579
I think. But why would draw indicate that? What are these what are these are drawing tap the alien

663
01:42:11,579 --> 01:42:15,579
icon and any responses you don't draw. You're the fucking alien. The player seems to be taking way

664
01:42:15,579 --> 01:42:20,060
too long to move on. You can tap the hurry up button to speed up the timer.

665
01:42:20,060 --> 01:42:22,779
We're on the clock here people so let's keep it going. I trust you both.

666
01:42:24,380 --> 01:42:28,220
I think you just wait out the timer. Oh yeah you can speed it up. I'm speeding it up.

667
01:42:28,220 --> 01:42:34,939
My tablet still isn't working. I'm very sad. Wait have you been tested? Okay next captain

668
01:42:34,939 --> 01:42:39,899
you're in charge. All right you're the captain. Okay let's get a move on. Pick another room. Oh

669
01:42:39,899 --> 01:42:48,710
the clown room. Oh there's less than nine minutes. The alien's the captain.

670
01:42:54,899 --> 01:43:00,819
Welcome to the writing pod. We'll see who's really good at writing jokes. Answer honestly

671
01:43:00,819 --> 01:43:06,020
because it will be scrutinized. Okay the alien virus will allow the intruders to get something

672
01:43:06,020 --> 01:43:11,380
similar but not quite right. When the correct prompt is revealed it will be up to you to

673
01:43:11,380 --> 01:43:19,640
determine if any seem odd. As time winds down I'll do my best to send the alien some real

674
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:38,010
stinkers. It's the least I can do. Okay. So you draw stuff and then the computer. Let's see the

675
01:43:38,010 --> 01:43:49,819
human prompt. The last movie I saw was. Okay what can we harp on? Look for any written answer that

676
01:43:49,819 --> 01:44:00,119
doesn't seem quite right and don't forget to hit that suspicion button. It's Ashley. Is that even

677
01:44:00,119 --> 01:44:10,779
a movie? I think you're supposed to give vague enough answers that like you. I think. Are you

678
01:44:10,779 --> 01:44:14,140
voting on me as alien? What? Yeah I'm gonna walk over to your room and shoot you right now.

679
01:44:14,140 --> 01:44:19,819
Alien viruses capabilities. Aliens now have the ability to hack the prompts. I know what movies

680
01:44:19,819 --> 01:44:26,699
you've watched. Okay. I know what you've seen recently. An alien can select any human and

681
01:44:26,699 --> 01:44:33,659
secretly give them the alien prompt. To make things worse aliens can choose to help themselves

682
01:44:33,659 --> 01:44:39,340
and switch their own prompt. I hope you got all of that because there's no way I'm repeating it.

683
01:44:39,340 --> 01:44:44,939
Dr. Strange came out three years ago. Okay next captain you're in charge. Yeah I just saw it like

684
01:44:45,420 --> 01:44:51,180
I just watched it. All right here we go. You're picking drawings order. No I'm not.

685
01:44:51,180 --> 01:45:03,239
Wait I want to go to the place we haven't seen. Husband versus wife. Deliberate off.

686
01:45:03,239 --> 01:45:08,520
Humans will be given a difficult decision and must choose which answer seems appropriate to them.

687
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:13,800
Aliens will see no dilemma and must choose their answers blindly. When the crew sees the full

688
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:18,840
statement aliens may have to justify their random selection or face suspicion.

689
01:45:21,270 --> 01:45:26,390
Make your choice. Let's see what these players choose. If they're an alien I bet it's peculiar.

690
01:45:27,109 --> 01:45:38,310
Would you like to play a game? Finished. Only seven more minutes. Humans received.

691
01:45:40,739 --> 01:45:45,859
Every time you eat cheese you destroy a small sentient universe. You must.

692
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:54,810
Do any of these seem stinky? Now you have to decide who's an alien or just makes terrible

693
01:45:54,810 --> 01:45:59,930
life decisions. You must slow down. And don't forget about those alien hacks. A smart alien

694
01:45:59,930 --> 01:46:12,010
can make someone look suspicious by flipping their prompts. I know that when you say something like

695
01:46:12,010 --> 01:46:17,930
oh Monopoly is my favorite board game everybody goes holy come on man what about like Settlers of

696
01:46:17,930 --> 01:46:25,829
Catan. To me like this is the Settlers of Catan version in this game. I kind of want to go back

697
01:46:25,829 --> 01:46:34,869
to Monopoly. I don't follow. Is the glitching getting worse? I feel like it's getting worse.

698
01:46:34,869 --> 01:46:39,430
Look at your device. You can now reach the button and take us to the extraction room

699
01:46:39,430 --> 01:46:43,750
but I would recommend you only do this once you complete your suspicions.

700
01:46:43,829 --> 01:46:50,310
Okay next captain you're in charge. Because it's Ashley. What? The game's over because

701
01:46:50,310 --> 01:46:55,189
Ashley's the alien. Star is pretty quick to accuse Ashley. Welcome to the extraction room.

702
01:46:55,189 --> 01:47:00,630
Check it out I've stopped the timer. It's costing me a lot of cpu but I don't want you to feel rush.

703
01:47:00,630 --> 01:47:04,149
Since you were the one to push the button. I think we're supposed to be talking to each other.

704
01:47:04,149 --> 01:47:09,670
You believe is an alien. We are. We're having a fun time. Yeah you're supposed to quiz people

705
01:47:09,670 --> 01:47:14,869
on what their answers were. If you all vote yes and this player is an alien.

706
01:47:17,109 --> 01:47:21,029
I'm not the alien. Why would you put me in here? It's curtains for us all.

707
01:47:21,029 --> 01:47:25,270
This is no no no no no this is where we talk. I am not I'm actually I don't understand how the

708
01:47:25,270 --> 01:47:29,189
game works but I know that I'm not the alien. She's the one with the button. So why did you

709
01:47:29,189 --> 01:47:35,590
put me in here? Because I wanted to see how it ends. The crew member who pushed the button

710
01:47:35,590 --> 01:47:46,100
can no longer push it. I also don't really understand the uh acts. I guess you can change

711
01:47:46,100 --> 01:47:52,680
captain you're in charge. How do I push the button on someone? I think a lady captain can do some

712
01:47:52,680 --> 01:47:59,239
stuff. Uh drawing oh I'm gonna go back to the drawing quarters. On my tablet. Just because

713
01:47:59,239 --> 01:48:05,180
I like drawing but I'm gonna bring oh I suddenly suspicious of stir here. Two players to test oh

714
01:48:05,739 --> 01:48:13,260
okay. Another drawing test I approve. You guys talked over the instructions. I tried to tell

715
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:33,050
their drawings could reveal an alien. Oh I wanted to draw that's okay. Oh yeah oh I can't just like

716
01:48:33,050 --> 01:48:38,810
make it go really fast. I tried to just like say hurry up so you guys had to go really fast.

717
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:48,300
Did I mention that if humans use all of their button pushes without success you lose? Well you

718
01:48:48,300 --> 01:48:54,819
do. Two total hacks. With four people the ability doesn't hit as hard.

719
01:48:55,779 --> 01:49:02,279
And you can push the button and vote at any time. Okay I see. Sorry if you heard that

720
01:49:02,279 --> 01:49:08,729
gulping. It was pretty sexy though. I'm like way down with my oh wait I can submit.

721
01:49:09,930 --> 01:49:19,260
Yeah yeah hit submit. The prompt humans saw was draw shirtless Abe Lincoln.

722
01:49:19,819 --> 01:49:27,659
Shirtless. Ashley's has a shirt. Like it's fucking. No see the whole time.

723
01:49:27,659 --> 01:49:32,539
Ashley's is clearly wearing a shirt. Look at that. That's got a collar on it. I did not say shirtless.

724
01:49:33,180 --> 01:49:37,180
Oh you're the alien. That's oh.

725
01:49:41,270 --> 01:49:51,079
Is that how we push the button on her? Alien. Oh you're the alien. I hope you're not wasting

726
01:49:51,079 --> 01:49:56,680
my time. This is just general Abe Lincoln. He's clearly wearing his clothes. You only get one

727
01:49:56,680 --> 01:50:05,720
minute so act quickly. Okay yeah I want to yeah. Okay time to vote. Yes. Yeah. Oh come on dudes.

728
01:50:06,680 --> 01:50:11,479
The vote passed. This is what it's like to be in prison. So is it did we do it?

729
01:50:12,199 --> 01:50:14,359
Yeah. So I did.

730
01:50:16,520 --> 01:50:17,399
Because it wasn't me.

731
01:50:23,819 --> 01:50:25,819
Joking that's. I regret everything.

732
01:50:27,739 --> 01:50:28,619
Die human.

733
01:50:31,220 --> 01:50:37,859
Good job idiots. But you're an alien. I'm not. Why'd you draw a shirt? I thought this is just

734
01:50:37,859 --> 01:50:43,140
the tutorial. You didn't say shirtless on it. Okay I get it. So Ronnie gave you the prompt to

735
01:50:43,140 --> 01:50:52,899
draw a shirt. Oh yeah I'm dabbing. Let's go. So who was it? It was Ronnie. Ronnie was the alien.

736
01:50:56,039 --> 01:51:01,800
Because it told me to draw Hamilton and I thought they meant Alexander Hamilton and I drew just a

737
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:05,880
dude with a skull patch because I don't know what Alexander Hamilton looks like.

738
01:51:06,039 --> 01:51:07,560
Protocol zephyr nine.

739
01:51:10,680 --> 01:51:15,880
It was a play that was popular for like five minutes. We got it this time. Wait are we doing

740
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:21,159
it again? Please look at your device and confirm your identity. Your device can tell you if you're.

741
01:51:22,119 --> 01:51:25,720
All right I'm gonna listen to the instructions. Yeah we need to actually debate each other so

742
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:30,520
they can figure it out. You guys were like silent after everything. Hold on that whole time you're

743
01:51:30,520 --> 01:51:33,560
like it's Ashley. Ashley. Ashley. Just do it. It's Ashley. Skip it. It's Ashley.

744
01:51:34,279 --> 01:51:40,939
That was the whole last 10 minutes. It wasn't. Ashley and Ronnie were messing with each other.

745
01:51:40,939 --> 01:51:44,060
Choose an available room and your desired participants. I've got too many windows open.

746
01:51:44,939 --> 01:51:53,989
Uh operation deck okay. Uh two players to test. I want Jerma versus Dirt. Jerma versus Dirt.

747
01:51:53,989 --> 01:52:01,449
I actually just got out there. Not the fucking aliens. Answer the question. Turn and get a voice.

748
01:52:10,229 --> 01:52:12,069
And the prompt for humans was.

749
01:52:14,310 --> 01:52:19,270
A hacker wants $50,000 or they will release your text messages to the world.

750
01:52:19,270 --> 01:52:22,949
You would say and this is how the participants responded.

751
01:52:33,609 --> 01:52:39,770
You don't think you would say like hey I want 50 grand. Like no because I have

752
01:52:39,770 --> 01:52:42,250
nothing to hide. Well neither do I but what else do they have?

753
01:52:44,409 --> 01:52:47,770
They have your text messages. They get your text. They're in the cloud. They have everything else.

754
01:52:47,770 --> 01:52:51,130
They have all the pictures of you like bending over to look at your asshole.

755
01:52:51,130 --> 01:52:54,250
So they have all the pictures on your phone too and you don't want you don't want people to see

756
01:52:54,250 --> 01:52:58,890
that. We're on the clock here. For medical reasons. I need to look sometimes. I don't think you're an

757
01:52:58,890 --> 01:53:03,050
alien. I just think you've got some perverted shit on your phone. You talk a lot of stuff and

758
01:53:03,050 --> 01:53:07,930
centering people for making. You want to give $50,000. Remember when you were sitting there

759
01:53:07,930 --> 01:53:13,130
with the bread loaf. I'm just saying if they've got text messages they've got

760
01:53:13,130 --> 01:53:17,050
they've got like they've got probably bank accounts. They're going to take the 50,000.

761
01:53:17,770 --> 01:53:22,329
Bring it down to eight and I'll do it. New captain. Give someone eight thousand dollars.

762
01:53:26,649 --> 01:53:28,569
No you're just a sick sick man.

763
01:53:32,920 --> 01:53:41,590
Waiting pod. Writing test.

764
01:53:42,310 --> 01:53:47,109
Oh finally. Write an answer to the comms on your device.

765
01:53:52,119 --> 01:53:58,489
I bet you're naked under all those clothes. Yeah. What's that guy's name? Forget about under the

766
01:53:58,489 --> 01:54:16,420
clothes. I'm not even wearing any. That's common knowledge. And here's what humans saw.

767
01:54:18,819 --> 01:54:22,340
The actor or actress I want to play me in a movie is

768
01:54:25,449 --> 01:54:32,489
anything odd. Okay that's pretty suspicious. Wouldn't it be awesome

769
01:54:32,489 --> 01:54:38,170
if Peter Dinklage played me and everyone else in the movie acted like I was still me.

770
01:54:39,369 --> 01:54:45,210
Yeah but that's I mean and they don't they don't look down to make eye contact with them either.

771
01:54:45,210 --> 01:54:48,810
They're looking up because like they see me but it's Peter Dinklage.

772
01:54:48,810 --> 01:54:53,640
Okay so they're definitely not the only one.

773
01:54:53,640 --> 01:54:59,479
Let's keep it going. What? Why would he not be the? Because all these responses are very honest.

774
01:55:00,760 --> 01:55:07,000
Yeah but that I mean that's a very clear like mind gymnastics. That's 100% my answer. Like if I had

775
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:12,840
the power it's him. Yes. He has to do that role. His agent comes to him with he's like no no god

776
01:55:13,399 --> 01:55:21,109
they force him to the drawing quarters. Drawing quarters? I don't want to draw.

777
01:55:21,909 --> 01:55:26,300
I'm sorry you keep getting left out of these German but. That's fine. It's art battle.

778
01:55:26,300 --> 01:55:29,819
No it actually needs to. Hey thank you. You have entered the drawing quarters.

779
01:55:29,819 --> 01:55:34,539
All right here we go. That's gotta come up with a grand. Draw the prompt on your device.

780
01:55:35,739 --> 01:55:44,359
I'm getting hacked. What does it mean when it says total hacks at the bottom?

781
01:55:45,369 --> 01:55:48,649
Uh I think that's at the amount of times the alien can interfere.

782
01:55:49,449 --> 01:56:04,500
I wouldn't know. I'm just guessing. If they're taking too long to draw the

783
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:14,229
hurry up button can help pick up the pace. Do I get a hurry up button? Oh that's the total.

784
01:56:14,229 --> 01:56:19,350
It's way at the bottom left for me. Hold on so there's a some whoever the alien is has

785
01:56:19,350 --> 01:56:25,449
already done two hacks. That's the total amount of hacks total. Not how many you have left.

786
01:56:26,699 --> 01:56:30,140
Yeah. Somebody is fucking with us. Somebody said no. Is that one guy?

787
01:56:31,020 --> 01:56:39,239
That's completely wrong. We've only had two. So I had it right the first time so that's the amount

788
01:56:39,239 --> 01:56:43,880
of hacks that are available. I'll be honest I don't know how the hacks work. I don't know

789
01:56:43,880 --> 01:56:52,039
what they're for. It's to mix like to make a human get an alien prompt or like switch it around so

790
01:56:52,039 --> 01:56:57,819
a human looks like an alien. Gotcha. You read it wrong you're the one guy.

791
01:56:59,020 --> 01:57:07,510
Let's see it in the chat. What the fuck? And the human prompt was

792
01:57:09,880 --> 01:57:21,979
draw yourself in the future. Oh my god no way. What do we think? I mean Ronnie what's going on

793
01:57:21,979 --> 01:57:29,579
here? I have no idea. It said draw myself the future and I thought Dragon Ball is just a super

794
01:57:29,579 --> 01:57:35,300
future. Maybe I'll be I'd have no idea where. Why do you say pulled up? Because I thought once

795
01:57:35,300 --> 01:57:41,850
after I drew him with his hands up it reminded me of that meme image. The fallout guy. We're

796
01:57:41,850 --> 01:57:50,170
on the clock here people so let's keep going. Alien. Alien. I don't know I think he's a robot.

797
01:57:50,170 --> 01:57:56,630
I mean Ronnie would draw himself as Vegeta in the future but the hold up it's not adding up man

798
01:57:57,590 --> 01:58:01,670
and everyone knows you don't write words when you're doing draw my thing or draw anything.

799
01:58:01,670 --> 01:58:06,149
That's a good point. And only an alien would not know to not write words.

800
01:58:07,510 --> 01:58:13,750
Yeah let's stir in my picture. We're on a dolphin. Nice. Also this is really funny to me because

801
01:58:13,750 --> 01:58:19,109
anytime for years when someone's drawing something I tell them to draw me for the future

802
01:58:19,109 --> 01:58:22,550
or draw yourself for the future and Ashley got to do it.

803
01:58:26,470 --> 01:58:33,270
Why can't emergencies have calm alarms? Next captain. I uh I'm gonna go ahead.

804
01:58:33,909 --> 01:58:37,350
Uh there's a the bio there's whoa hold on a minute here there's a bio scanner.

805
01:58:39,020 --> 01:58:52,329
What's the bio scanner? Put Ronnie in the scan me. Let's scan him. Come on do it. This is the

806
01:58:52,329 --> 01:58:56,970
bio scanner. Good luck. I hope you've chosen a team. Oh you didn't put yourself in did you? Captain

807
01:58:56,970 --> 01:59:03,050
I'm sending you the correct glyphs now. I don't think you can. Wait I gotta hold on I need to

808
01:59:03,050 --> 01:59:15,560
look at this. Wait what is happening? Uh hold on. Describe your glyphs Jerma. No. Yeah you have to.

809
01:59:15,560 --> 01:59:21,720
Oh oh oh oh describe the symbols. Okay so all right so we got describe the symbols below that

810
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:32,420

813
01:59:55,380 --> 02:00:05,989
like the bus stop man falling straight down or diving and then uh conjoined twins okay okay

814
02:00:06,869 --> 02:00:17,050
all right how we doing you hit a button yeah hurry up i'm done okay what do we got the test has failed

815
02:00:17,130 --> 02:00:26,119
how did we both get it wrong okay that was suspicious maybe test humans next time

816
02:00:29,699 --> 02:00:39,420
hold on a second this one's hard okay so might have been it hold on star what he said man diving

817
02:00:40,470 --> 02:00:44,710
man diving the man falling down diving is the middle one here people so let's keep it going

835
02:03:12,039 --> 02:03:17,720
how did you tell you to draw it told me to draw a magic portal isolate since this is our first so i

836
02:03:17,720 --> 02:03:23,319
was making a guy i was gonna have a magician in there a magic portal why would i draw a big

837
02:03:23,319 --> 02:03:28,359
circle like that it's ronnie now the non-isolated member how do we how do we pick the guy wait no

838
02:03:28,359 --> 02:03:37,399
it's germa in there yeah it's him no it's not me you don't write hold up on bajita that's right

839
02:03:37,399 --> 02:03:42,840
what wait wait wait wait star star why are you why your star is incredibly gung-ho about this

840
02:03:42,840 --> 02:03:52,810
whole thing why who did you put it this either you were you drew a black hole there's still two

841
02:03:52,810 --> 02:03:56,810
hacks get star in there no get star in there get him in there unless it doesn't tell you if a hack

842
02:03:56,810 --> 02:04:03,460
was used no steve's answers were so honest oh no they were not yes they were peter dinklage come

843
02:04:03,460 --> 02:04:09,460
on peter dinklage yeah absolutely trying to come here to the bus kill him i yeah and it was star

844
02:04:09,460 --> 02:04:22,229
that good work everybody nice work you killed an innocent man oh i just don't know how the ui works

845
02:04:22,310 --> 02:04:23,510
to get ronnie in there instead

846
02:04:32,600 --> 02:04:37,000
we had 20 seconds left in 20 seconds i'm gonna figure out how to get ronnie in that room

847
02:04:38,359 --> 02:04:43,640
i'll just take a bed and kill germa you could have just voted for me and then uh it would the

848
02:04:43,640 --> 02:04:48,840
vote would have canceled the vote that i had was no or yes for germa that's all i had then you hit

849
02:04:48,840 --> 02:04:53,239
no and that would have been in yeah well i mean i figured that's what i'm saying is i don't know

850
02:04:53,239 --> 02:04:59,399
how long it would have taken to set up the ronnie vote because i don't i don't like this game oh it

851
02:04:59,399 --> 02:05:07,189
even needs more people yeah i think even harder i think it'd be fun if it was even just two people

852
02:05:07,189 --> 02:05:12,409
i mean this is still interesting but with like maybe like six people i think would be perfect

853
02:05:13,449 --> 02:05:15,609
yeah ten people would be too crazy

854
02:05:15,609 --> 02:05:21,420
so

855
02:05:21,420 --> 02:05:27,579
why did you write hold up ronnie yeah i don't know i completely flubbed that because it said draw

856
02:05:27,579 --> 02:05:35,340
yourself it didn't say draw yourself in the future it just said draw yourself because i thought why

857
02:05:35,340 --> 02:05:40,380
would it make me draw myself i'm the alien it's lying to me i'll draw something else and talk my

858
02:05:40,380 --> 02:05:44,939
way out of it so i said all right i'll draw vegeta because maybe it'll say what's the last movie you

859
02:05:44,939 --> 02:05:49,579
saw or something and they're like oh okay i could just say obviously and anything in your life you

860
02:05:49,579 --> 02:05:54,539
could relate to dragon ball so it was a good play yeah all right uh you guys want to do

861
02:05:55,260 --> 02:06:00,140
one more before because i gotta get going soon yeah yeah yeah let's do one more of this so you

862
02:06:00,140 --> 02:06:04,619
want to go back and do like the dictionary one i feel like we need a sort of round two for dictionary

863
02:06:04,619 --> 02:06:11,020
uh streamer's choice yep yeah i feel hold on let me see streamer's choice do you want me to

864
02:06:11,020 --> 02:06:16,619
leave for the next one no you're okay i mean you were the alien and killed us all twice

865
02:06:17,180 --> 02:06:24,170
i said i know i haven't even seen this one is this one really that bad to like not even play it once

866
02:06:24,170 --> 02:06:33,670
in the in the whole pack why don't we just do it we're gonna do it fine fine i mean we have what

867
02:06:33,670 --> 02:06:39,189
we're just gonna play jack box six and just skip one of the whole games in here well we gotta put

868
02:06:39,189 --> 02:06:43,590
a nut in to make the others feel better yeah it's actually okay with four people

869
02:06:44,310 --> 02:06:50,390
so we just don't just do this with four people don't just have to be a private game it'll be

870
02:06:50,390 --> 02:06:58,310
worse with chip okay all right screw you chip all right so also your jokes were so

871
02:06:58,310 --> 02:07:05,989

891
02:10:08,760 --> 02:10:21,479
mean all right i'm clicking everybody's in in 10 seconds okay this is how people will see me

892
02:10:25,399 --> 02:10:26,600
all right your hands are whatever

893
02:10:34,039 --> 02:10:39,800
if you have any questions about our process you're not alone here at the lab we've spent

894
02:10:39,800 --> 02:10:45,560
years searching for the genetic magic that makes each and every human a truly unique individual

895
02:10:45,560 --> 02:10:51,239
but that was hard so we found a shortcut we theorize every friend group has some version of

896
02:10:51,239 --> 02:10:57,399
the smart one the popular one the troubled loner who i can change you get all of those

897
02:10:57,399 --> 02:11:04,520
and these roles make it a lot easier to figure people out with science you guys are going to

898
02:11:04,520 --> 02:11:09,640
match your fellow test subjects to the roles that fit them best my lovely assistant will

899
02:11:09,640 --> 02:11:14,039
put all the data into the tubes and at the end we'll crunch the numbers and tell each of you

900
02:11:14,039 --> 02:11:21,079
who you really are okay i moved all the chemicals out of licking distance so let's go i need a

901
02:11:21,079 --> 02:11:25,720
category to get us started vote for your favorite but try to make it something everybody knows a

902
02:11:25,720 --> 02:11:31,560
little bit about everyone knows a little bit about their deepest fears game of thrones that's what i

903
02:11:32,119 --> 02:11:37,079
oh i might be able to oh i'm gonna smoke you in spice girls you freaking millennials

904
02:11:38,359 --> 02:11:49,079
um ronnie ronnie i'm 34 which of these is secretly your deepest fear so on your device

905
02:11:49,079 --> 02:11:53,640
you've got the names of your fellow lab rats drag each one to the room you think fits them best

906
02:11:53,640 --> 02:11:58,119
you have to drag these to the people you think fits this best you'll see a little 99 sign next

907
02:11:58,119 --> 02:12:04,439
to each room tap that to lock oh god your 99 will match what everyone else picks i'll make

908
02:12:04,439 --> 02:12:08,840
it worth your while if you're right so make sure to pick someone when everyone's given out their

909
02:12:08,840 --> 02:12:26,920
roles we'll check out the results i think i got it i think i got this mail why does it say hold up

910
02:12:32,300 --> 02:12:41,529
let's see where we landed let's look at those votes get rid of the outliers

911
02:12:42,409 --> 02:12:49,579
we have our winner is scared of snakes how do you win being scared of snakes i win so i'll give

912
02:12:49,579 --> 02:12:55,340
you guys these nutritious science pellets whenever your answers match the group whoever has the most

913
02:12:55,340 --> 02:13:08,630
at the end of the month plus they're a healthy snack subjects who already have a role don't need

914
02:13:09,350 --> 02:13:16,470
so let's lose these votes stir knows me way too well why did it was two v2

915
02:13:17,829 --> 02:13:32,489
oh we both know ashley hey given public speeches before i was good

916
02:13:32,489 --> 02:13:37,850
fuck you good how why would i be afraid of something that i know i just love the word

917
02:13:37,850 --> 02:13:42,569
clowns that i put you on this yeah we all knew you'd be a person well i just got a super pellet

918
02:13:42,569 --> 02:13:49,369
thanks guys you got the clown streamer afraid of himself there's our line up here's how you're

919
02:13:49,369 --> 02:13:54,970
doing on science pellets just a reminder i'll reward you with pellets when your answers match

920
02:13:54,970 --> 02:13:59,449
the group or when you do the best in a type breaker experiment keep that in mind if you

921
02:13:59,449 --> 02:14:14,579
want to be the lab rat of the month what's our next category all right uh next category i don't

922
02:14:14,579 --> 02:14:22,649
know anything i don't know anything about writing it i got i got way too excited about clicking

923
02:14:22,649 --> 02:14:30,090
dwarves i'm i i'm only doing this because i know i know them all me too yeah you know them all

924
02:14:32,970 --> 02:14:39,529
don't give it away sleepy bb bb bb which of the seven dwarves are you don't overthink this

925
02:14:40,090 --> 02:14:44,250
and remember to tap the 99% most strongly about

926
02:14:47,619 --> 02:14:53,140
ronnie bashful i think oh yeah you just say well it's just okay let's all follow ashley's answers

927
02:14:56,329 --> 02:15:04,489
also is doc a roll what doc is he a grumpy or a doctor no he's just like the average he's like

928
02:15:04,489 --> 02:15:11,050
the super mario the door is the super mario some would call some would call him potentially the

929
02:15:11,050 --> 02:15:18,069
like the ultimate dwarf yeah he's got everything very basic and smash where does he even get his

930
02:15:18,069 --> 02:15:26,520
degree go to the road oh i forget this let's see that data does it not seem so white

931
02:15:30,279 --> 02:15:34,439
you really actually or at least what your friends think wait yeah we we're not supposed to because

932
02:15:34,520 --> 02:15:37,239
we're not supposed to influence each other without really just picked it

933
02:15:38,279 --> 02:15:43,479
yeah ashley ruined the whole experiment why'd you go with what i said i didn't you're grumpy

934
02:15:43,479 --> 02:15:48,760
i made you seriously i wanted to pick yourself as grumpy yeah ashley's grumpy look at her face

935
02:15:48,760 --> 02:15:53,800
sorry you earned the role with a highly motivating audience bonus i think our control group likes you

936
02:15:56,859 --> 02:16:06,390
the edge you hate your wifey adopting myself as doc because i'm too smart to follow naming

937
02:16:06,390 --> 02:16:22,819
conventions oh crap what was the other one all right now don't talk about your answers

938
02:16:23,779 --> 02:16:29,460
nobody's fine because we gotta it's gotta be real here's how it all shook out yeah unless one of

939
02:16:29,460 --> 02:16:40,170
the choices is like idiot you are scary good at this do you want a job oh i'm scary okay you've

940
02:16:40,170 --> 02:16:43,370
each got some roles under your belt let's see what the data tells us

941
02:16:44,579 --> 02:16:49,940
i think the faces are influenced by your roles your total opposites from a very specific point

942
02:16:49,940 --> 02:16:55,379
of view anyway we're gonna pit you against each other and see even the game knows you're turned

943
02:16:55,379 --> 02:17:00,420
10 years old again for one day what do you do i want both of you to write an answer that

944
02:17:00,420 --> 02:17:04,819
ends early right right the others will decide who did you're talking with the instructions

945
02:17:04,819 --> 02:17:24,969
is 10 for a day oh god my answer is terribly here it is oh shit devices now super easy

946
02:17:27,770 --> 02:17:35,290
these are both good though actually i mean and it totally tells our age yeah answer match their

947
02:17:35,290 --> 02:17:41,690
characteristics the best not whose answer is the best yeah we both keep the same answer i mean

948
02:17:41,690 --> 02:17:45,930
seriously carefree buy bitcoin worry invest in apple this is pretty damn good

949
02:17:45,930 --> 02:17:56,389
points we're going with you bitcoin when i was 10 you guys i would make my plans tell me you've got

stage to do stand-up comedy at an open mic you have nothing prepared how do you start answer

952
02:18:08,069 --> 02:18:14,069
the prompt on your devices and we'll settle this once and for all oh that's easy uh

953
02:18:23,700 --> 02:18:26,899
yeah what if we choose the same answer yeah probably will

954
02:18:29,239 --> 02:18:33,159
okay there's the data apologize

955
02:18:38,219 --> 02:18:45,030

968
02:20:29,420 --> 02:20:35,420
here's what i want each of you to do who goes first is up to you the other lab rats will

969
02:20:35,420 --> 02:20:39,340
decide who deserves the role show even if you're not sure you want the role

970
02:20:39,340 --> 02:20:44,299
i'm handing out science pellets to the winner so do your best it's an experiment man you think

971
02:20:44,299 --> 02:20:51,700
schrodinger's cat always wants to get in the box are we supposed to be in the same room is that

974
02:21:03,940 --> 02:21:09,299
crumple down into a ball and lie down in a semicircle and just like kind of shake

975
02:21:11,059 --> 02:21:18,809
that's a good dance stir um um i hold on 20 seconds i can think uh germa's beating you

976
02:21:20,069 --> 02:21:25,209
look at him shaking down there on the floor i mean i'm still going he's going nuts you're you

977
02:21:25,209 --> 02:21:30,489
standing there point out how like every individual acne on my face and say i'm pizza face over and

978
02:21:30,489 --> 02:21:39,530
over again it's like it's like a face pointing dance that's you being like a self-deprecating

979
02:21:39,530 --> 02:21:45,370
like psycho according to our disturbingly sentient algorithm the role goes to you what is it pointing

980
02:21:45,370 --> 02:21:50,729
dance performing the best in this experiment is definitely worth a few science pellets

981
02:21:52,709 --> 02:21:53,989
just don't spoil your dinner

982
02:21:54,229 --> 02:22:05,639
um you only got one vote but you're still the best person for this role science can be weird

983
02:22:05,639 --> 02:22:14,600
what pineapple and our audience control group but you're the wackiest topping you know you're

984
02:22:14,600 --> 02:22:20,600
the pineapple on that beach you're the one some people like yeah you don't belong in everyone

985
02:22:20,600 --> 02:22:29,430
hates you here's where we ended up punch punch him punch him punch him one last thing before

986
02:22:29,430 --> 02:22:33,110
i think i'm winning at being the most predictable let's see if there are any more interesting

987
02:22:33,110 --> 02:22:43,340
patterns in those roles you judging by your roles you're this and you're also this i'm very

988
02:22:43,340 --> 02:22:48,780
dependable that makes no sense to our algorithm we're going to find out which quality fits you

989
02:22:48,780 --> 02:22:54,540
better what's the first thing you look for when shopping for a new car wheels this prompt on

990
02:22:54,540 --> 02:22:59,020
your device then the other subjects will vote on your response make sure it has wheels

991
02:23:00,459 --> 02:23:07,930
if it doesn't have wheels you just walk away how many clones can you fit money

992
02:23:10,010 --> 02:23:14,969
how much money is in the wheels yeah how much money could i fit in the wheels for all my cocaine

993
02:23:14,969 --> 02:23:27,819
dealing yeah that's what we're working with vote on your devices now read the context make sure

994
02:23:27,819 --> 02:23:39,559
no puke is that dependable or why that's both of them again give it to me more of i feel like

995
02:23:39,559 --> 02:23:45,239
wildcard always trumps dependable because you know by its very nature is the wild card trumps

996
02:23:45,239 --> 02:23:58,700
everything in science we call that a shutout your roles tell me that your polar opposites

997
02:23:59,420 --> 02:24:03,100
at least in this one extremely specific way we're not leaving

998
02:24:06,700 --> 02:24:12,940

1034
02:28:55,420 --> 02:29:04,950
writes something inappropriate uh you can just remove it that is a lot of pressure i'm a born mod

1035
02:29:09,510 --> 02:29:15,989
all right guys here it comes last game sub discord here it comes in 10 seconds

1036
02:29:16,790 --> 02:29:29,110
everybody's name these names look like they have never been shown before

1037
02:29:32,870 --> 02:29:39,430
to the dictionary it's a word game and don't ask me where i'm from it's a very complicated story

1038
02:29:40,069 --> 02:29:46,549
oh i see i am in very good company in the dictionary you will make up a dictionary entry

1039
02:29:46,549 --> 02:29:52,389
for a totally fake word there is no right answer but the most popular one wins so stay on your toes

1040
02:29:53,190 --> 02:29:58,629
oh and for anyone watching join the audience just input the room code and play along

1041
02:29:58,629 --> 02:30:04,709
let's get started room code top right jackbox.tv look your twitch i am giving you a new word

1042
02:30:08,180 --> 02:30:18,489
now write out the definition that fits this word hold up i heard this word singing in the sewer

1043
02:30:18,489 --> 02:30:35,739
and i said come up little word and it did think too hard about it or if that doesn't work try

1044
02:30:35,819 --> 02:31:07,239
thinking really hard about it done i'm done done submit time is almost up

1045
02:31:09,610 --> 02:31:17,639
good luck let's see what we got this gossipy horse in the herd

1046
02:31:20,329 --> 02:31:25,909
typically used as a finish on pork when you want someone to hold up but your mouth is full of

1047
02:31:25,909 --> 02:31:35,510
m&m's and baileys what successful cat call what what was that okay the time has come to vote

1048
02:31:36,469 --> 02:31:41,030
pick the definition that makes you feel i know that stirs because he immediately explained

1049
02:31:41,030 --> 02:31:47,989
i gotta explain it there's logic and remember you can award bonus points to the ones that stole

1050
02:31:48,309 --> 02:31:50,149
i don't understand m&m's

1051
02:32:03,479 --> 02:32:08,360
do you not know what m&m's are is that the hold up no it is but why m&m's and baileys

1052
02:32:09,079 --> 02:32:19,719
what's an m&m why not like nostalgic and the winning definition to be recorded forever in

1053
02:32:19,719 --> 02:32:28,040
the because that's the definition now he's winning ego is growing he's winning now let's do it again

1054
02:32:28,040 --> 02:32:36,090
for the other word shirt you work in but in ireland shirt dunked in coffee for the smell

1055
02:32:37,930 --> 02:32:43,610
man turns into a shirt when he sees a full moon after you take off your shirt

1056
02:32:46,409 --> 02:32:52,489
we're sure it's like a one-shirt but different pick the definition that's so accurate it makes

1057
02:32:52,729 --> 02:33:18,280
excellent luck these are really good after you take off your shirt it was a shirt someone still

1058
02:33:18,280 --> 02:33:31,479
has not broken that person should vote for the smell for the smell and the official note take

1059
02:33:31,479 --> 02:33:37,879
back definition for the word is right it is in logic

1060
02:33:37,879 --> 02:33:50,020
okay

1061
02:33:50,020 --> 02:33:55,180
round two this dictionary entry needs some synonyms to flesh it out ill flesh

1062
02:33:57,340 --> 02:34:01,819
give me another word that could mean the same thing as the definition on your device

1063
02:34:01,819 --> 02:34:06,299
round two goes fast so type type i hate this one because wear shirt is perfect

1064
02:34:25,059 --> 02:34:25,700

i hate them all too especially mine it's not my answer don't if i'll vote for the least likely

1069
02:35:18,409 --> 02:35:23,850

1161
02:50:37,340 --> 02:50:45,780
fateful findings that's the thing about imdb uh anyone can edit that shit so um no i don't know

1162
02:50:45,780 --> 02:51:01,450
what that is i think editing imdb is easier than editing wikipedia you know why because

1163
02:51:01,450 --> 02:51:10,020
nobody gives a shit when you're on imdb people actively try to fix wikipedia who's actively

hey jeremy i love your gaming and gamer gaming stuff do you prefer your pillows really

1169
02:51:53,540 --> 02:51:58,180
puffy and fluffy or really squishy also do you sleep better in warm weather or cold weather cold

1170
02:51:58,180 --> 02:52:04,979
weather absolutely uh you know actually that to get the best sleep you're supposed to sleep

1171
02:52:05,540 --> 02:52:11,139
in a cooler environment that means turn down the heat during the winter

1172
02:52:13,620 --> 02:52:29,690
sleeping at like 78 degrees is actually really not that good for you that is real yeah it's true

1173
02:52:29,690 --> 02:52:39,860
but uh pillow wise um i prefer i like squishy pillows because really like fluffy pillows you

1174
02:52:41,379 --> 02:52:47,700
you sink into them and they end up just turning into a little bunched up piece of crap whereas

1175
02:52:47,700 --> 02:52:53,780
a squishy pillow holds its form and can read you can lie on it you can put it on your uh especially

1176
02:52:53,780 --> 02:52:59,579
considering if you sleep on your side and you put your hand under your pillow a fluffy pillow

1177
02:52:59,579 --> 02:53:04,940
you end up with a you know you can get pins and needles in your hand and stuff no it's uh squishy
