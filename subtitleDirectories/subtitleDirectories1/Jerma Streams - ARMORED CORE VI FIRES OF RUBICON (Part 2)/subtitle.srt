00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,859
Hey guys, remember Jerma promised to play Dead Space before his 40th birthday.

2
00:00:33,049 --> 00:00:52,250
Um, that's true. No, that's true. I got a while. Still, uh, still fine with that statement,

3
00:00:52,250 --> 00:01:06,489
by the way. Am I doing today? I'm doing good. I am doing good. I have been itching to play

4
00:01:06,489 --> 00:01:15,379
Armored Core, but I decided I wasn't going to play it off stream. I decided I was going to

5
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:32,790
continue to play it on stream. We'll see after today. It's fun. I'm going to have to re-familiarize

6
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:38,299
myself with the controls because it has been a week and a half or so since I played it.

7
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:49,239
By the way, yes, there is a logo on my character and it's one that I made. I got kind of

8
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:54,280
inspiration. I saw, hey, look at these decals. Look at these decals. I'm going to make one.

9
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:01,109
Let me try making one. Mine's not as good as the others I've seen, but hey,

10
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:08,099
this editor is a lot of fun. It reminds me of the, uh, the 2k14 editor,

11
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:19,379
just way better than the new ones. Uh, I don't know what boss people are referring to,

12
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:27,669
but I don't think I've seen it yet. He's fishing for compliments. Yeah, I spent a little time on

13
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:39,500
it. So it's all right. What do you guys think? Bro, you're going to get filtered. We already

14
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:54,150
went over this that I, I, that's not here. That's not accurate here. Come on, give it a rest. Let

15
00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:02,060
him fish. He deserves compliments. Oh, by the way, have I ever clearly stated that frozen red grapes

16
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:09,830
are the best snack in the world? Have I been on the record saying that yet? Did I, have I actually

17
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:17,020
been on the record saying that? Frozen red grapes is the single best possible thing that the human

18
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:30,889
body can eat. Like I'm convinced they are so unbelievably good. It's not even funny. Those of

19
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:38,490
you that have never had, remember frozen all the way through none of this half frozen shit, because

20
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:47,240
it takes a little while for them to freeze all the way through. Red grapes, wash them, you know,

21
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:54,539
take off the stem, get them in a little container, freeze them overnight. You open that, eat one,

22
00:03:54,539 --> 00:04:01,580
don't just chomp right into it. Let it sit for a minute, bite into it. You know, it's frozen,

23
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:06,039
so it's going to be really cold. Just to make sure you know that you're into that. It's like

24
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:16,279
one of the greatest snacks ever. I eat them almost every day or every other day. They just, grapes

25
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:21,910
are so much better when they're frozen. I don't even really like grapes. They're good. They're

26
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:28,779
okay. But holy shit, you freeze them and it's, it changes everything. The whole thing changes.

27
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:36,699
Yeah. If you have sensitive teeth, be careful, but they don't. Oh my God. It's not like an ice

28
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:44,730
cube. They turn into this weird, like chewy jelly is the only way I can describe it.

29
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:53,740
If you know, you know, it's unbelievable. And all the people saying, ew, you just,

30
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:59,420
open up your, open up your mind a little, please open up your mind a little. You can say ew to

31
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:10,329
frozen grapes. Open your mind a little, please. What kind of grapes? Just, just red grapes. Green

32
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:17,399
grapes are okay with this formula, but it's the red ones, the smaller red ones that are way better.

33
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:27,720
Seedless, seedless grapes. No, they're not crunchy. They're chewy. You'll get it when you

34
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,040
understand. And I'm telling you, it's like going to be like a five gum commercial. When you eat

35
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:37,449
one of these, I just changed your life. Well, I didn't. That sounds like I'm taking credit for

36
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:43,139
that. I had frozen grapes a lot when I was younger. Something was like, you know what? I'm

37
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:48,550
going to do it. I feel like doing it. So I'm going to freeze some. So I, frozen grapes are going to

38
00:05:48,550 --> 00:06:01,350
change your life. Not me. You see, I made this up. This is, I came up with this. All right. You guys

39
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:08,420
good? I'm going to play, um, Armored Core 6, stream for a little bit. We'll see if, uh, if I'm still

40
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:13,420
into it in another hour or two, maybe I just keep playing it. If not, after like an hour or two,

41
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:18,230
I kind of want to play coin game. I got an update a few months ago. They added a bunch of new

42
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:34,180
machines and stuff. I like playing it. So we'll see. I'm just going to wing it today. Uh, here we go.

43
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:48,170
Oh, let me show you my, uh, my unit. Wait, should it be a surprise? Uh, let's see. There we go.

44
00:06:48,970 --> 00:07:02,360
Ah, take a look. Oh, see, I made this one. It sucks. That's how you can tell. I made this one.

45
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,199
I got inspiration from everybody that was making them. I was like, you know what? I'm going to try.

46
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:15,350
I made, I made 10 minutes. It took me like 15 minutes, 10 minutes. Yeah. I, I told you I was

47
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:28,389
going to do it actually pretty nice. I've seen some really clean ones. I think the teeth are a

48
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:37,509
little fucked up. I think I may have messed the teeth up a little, but it's okay. You can make

49
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:46,920
the paint have no wear. I kind of like the wear. Cool. All right. I'm ready. So is this the mission

50
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:55,180
that everyone's going to laugh at me for? Is this like the, here it is. Operation Wall Climber.

51
00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:04,899
All right, let's just go. I'm ready. How's the audio? Are we good?

52
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:18,569
Oh yeah. On second glance, it sucks. You were just looking for the go ahead for me to make

53
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:37,210
fun of it. I get it. I respect that. What do I got for, I got two big cannons, right? I got it.

54
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:47,590
He's not paying attention. It's four buttons in a dodge. I'll be fine. Oh, okay.

55
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:14,490
I got it. Can you make more clay creatures? I want hobby updates.

56
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:21,899
I actually haven't really. I really haven't. I've been kind of busy though. I'll get back

57
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:30,169
into it. I will. All right. I got two cannons. I got the quad missile launchers on both shoulders.

58
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:39,740
I think I'm good. Let's just go. He's going to remember the dash. It's a X, right?

59
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:57,080
You need to try crocheting. The problem with me with crocheting is I agree with you. I would sit

60
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,000
down. I'd have on my thread. Like, okay, let's get started. I'm going to take the green and the

61
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,519
blue and I'm going to start to crochet. I guess I'm going to stand up and fucking walk in a circle

62
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,360
and then I'm going to go get like a water and then pace for five minutes and then sit back down.

63
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:24,220
I can't, I can't do it. All right, here we go. Destroy the city. Gatling cannon. I got it easy

64
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:33,669
up there. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. That's right. We're like a corporation. Oh, that hurt.

65
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:49,610
Can I reach up there? What's a heel? All right. I gotta remember the buttons. It's been a while.

66
00:10:50,169 --> 00:11:00,629
How do you turn boost off? What's that? Okay. All right. All right. Now B is boost, right? Okay. Yep.

67
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:13,559
Left stick is that. All right. I got to get up there. All right. Who else is shooting over here?

68
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:29,799
You? I need full boost for this. What about Baldur's Gate three? I actually just barely

69
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:34,440
started to hold on. I can't talk right now. I actually just barely started to care about

70
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:54,870
Baldur's Gate three. Oh my God. What is even shooting at me? Oh, all right. Cannon's down.

71
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:15,139
What's left up here? Destroy the city. Gatling cannon and tetrapod MT. Where is that shit?

72
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:27,429
Not up top, right? Bro is never going to play Hylix two. Yes, I am. I promise at some point,

73
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:46,710
I mean, those things are weak. I just have to kill them. You also promised paper Mario. Yeah,

74
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:57,210
but for my 40th birthday, I got plenty of time. Oh, here we go. This thing. Oh,

75
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:03,179
I can't just sit there and stare at it. Okay. I get it. I get it. I get it. I'm going to be all

76
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:10,100
right. All right. I'm dead. All right. I get it. I get it. I get it. All right. I haven't played

77
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:21,259
this game in like two weeks. The last time you saw me play this game was the last time I had

78
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:29,529
the controller in my hand. All right. It's all these fucking dickheads right here.

79
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:54,600
What was that? What just happened? It's got to keep moving. That's all it is. Keep moving. Keep

80
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:01,299
moving. Keep moving. Keep moving. Come on. Come on. Come on. All right. Uh, maybe I shouldn't

81
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:20,250
have the weapon where you have to stand still to use it. That's probably a bad idea. Yeah. The

82
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,690
two weapons I have on left trigger and right trigger, I have to stand still for two seconds

83
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:41,509
to use them. Bad idea. See? All right. That's better than what I did last time. We're good.

84
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:57,750
All right. Land already. There you go. There you go. All right. Here we go.

85
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:16,629
Shit. Okay. Damn. All right. Should I just go right for the guy and not like the 50 people on

86
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:23,100
the wall shooting me? Or should I try to clear everything first? Because there's a million

87
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:54,460
people on this wall. I'm playing it wrong. Oh, shit. Shit. This game is really hard.

88
00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:18,470
All right. I'm doing this because these things stink here. Should I buy something new?

89
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:33,580
Just machine guns, probably? I'm going to try the machine guns. That's going to work, right?

90
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:48,039
Did that go through? All right. It did. This should be a little bit better.

91
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:10,569
Use the melee weapons. The melee weapons are fun. All right. I'm going to take this really slow.

92
00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:26,630
That's a bad idea. Okay. So I should never be in the air or not in the air, but should always

93
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:37,930
be moving as fast as I can. Oh my God. All right. It's only this group right in front of the bridge,

94
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:52,839
right? There's people everywhere. I'm just going to clear everything wicked slow.

95
00:17:53,160 --> 00:18:04,950
Activating combat mode. Do the frontal assault. I'm almost afraid to boot. I lose all my boost

96
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:20,650
before I even get over here. I'm going this way. I wish I could just snipe this guy up here. This

97
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:36,539
guy's ruining everything. What? This guy got homing shit on his bullshit. That's the boss?

98
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:56,170
Oh, well, that's why he's so annoying. Okay. I got a hit. All right. Where's this other guy?

99
00:18:56,170 --> 00:19:28,220
All right. He's dead. What chassis has the most boost? Oh my God. I can't kill this thing.

100
00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:42,940
Okay. So here are the 50 things on the wall. How do I fight this guy one-on-one?

101
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:54,490
Do I just don't? Just ignore these things? I feel like it's kind of hard to. Look at this.

102
00:19:55,289 --> 00:20:17,049
Destroy them all. I guess I could just kind of fly up there. Ow. No, no, no. I have no healing.

103
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:44,549
All right. That was a little bit better. I want different items. I don't like these.

104
00:20:44,549 --> 00:21:08,410
Nice bit, right? Okay. What, what is going on here? What is this thing? This is kind of good.

105
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:16,650
I want something that takes down the, what is it called? The shield? Maybe the big,

106
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:24,900
the big guns. I have to stand still though. And I get hit too quickly. Maybe I should get the

107
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:34,019
shield thing. I feel like when I jump up, I just see like, like 10 lasers just go right on top of

108
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:48,579
me. Maybe I could just block them. This is the back. What does this thing do? Laser cannon on

109
00:21:48,579 --> 00:21:59,609
the back. Ooh, that's cool. Dual missiles. That's good. That takes a long time though.

110
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:12,710
That takes a long time too. It looks good. That's like an AOE. I kind of want to try this. This is

111
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:23,180
expensive, but I want it. Vertical missiles are OP. Verts are OP. Okay. It takes a long time to

112
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:27,380
reload, but I feel like I'm just going to be, I'm going to be a coward. Okay, here we go. Combine

113
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:45,829
it. Let me put it on. It does way more damage too. What about the, what should I get for the other

114
00:22:45,829 --> 00:23:01,769
side? Can you doi doi doi? Yeah, for old time's sake. Sure. You know, remember, remember the good

115
00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:08,700
old days. Use the sword. I actually agree with that. I genuinely agree with that. I love that

116
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:17,880
sword. It was very good. But what do I want on the right side? Something, something better.

117
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:37,460
Something a little flashier. What's this? Ooh, I want this. All right. This might be a terrible

118
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:59,369
design, but who cares? Shotgun? Shotgun, blade, little missiles, big missiles. I think it's all

119
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:13,529
right. Go in with no weapons. Just go in and use punch with my hands. I think I'm all right with

120
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:20,549
this. All right. It's time to try. Those were all just, I was just doing those too. All right. This

121
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:29,750
is the real one. This is the real one. This one's for real. This is going to shred. All right. This

122
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:52,710
is, I did my warmup. Here we go. All right. Check it out. Just, just go. Get out of here.

123
00:24:54,069 --> 00:25:05,940
Get out of here. Where's the other? All right. What was shooting from behind? You see that?

124
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:15,099
It gave me an indicator that something was, what, what, what is shooting at me? There's people down

125
00:25:15,099 --> 00:25:31,430
here. Okay. I'm just testing it out. All right. That's a shotgun. All right. I'm just going to

126
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:39,740
clear shit. Okay. All right. Everything here's down here's dead. It's not, it's not a race.

127
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:53,750
It's not a race. God damn it. Why do I feel like I have no boost? Do I have like a shit chassis on?

128
00:25:54,470 --> 00:26:34,259
Okay. Let's go. I'm wrapping around this way. All right. That's good. All right. Good. Come on

129
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:51,289
target. It's dead. Where are they going? All right. All right. That one's dead. Fuck you.

130
00:26:52,700 --> 00:27:01,420
Oh my God. This is correct. Oh my God. This is correct. I figured it out. This is correct.

131
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:29,450
Oh, this is correct. Let's get rid of these. Okay. Why do you have a Christmas laugh? That was just

132
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:39,529
like a comedy laugh. That's not how I actually laugh. No guys. When I'm watching like the latest

133
00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:46,500
Will Ferrell movie, I don't go. That's just like a, Ooh, I'm excited because I'm doing something

134
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:59,750
fun right now. That's not, that's not how I laugh at jokes. Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh,

135
00:28:12,009 --> 00:28:28,259
fuck off. Kill this motherfucker. Get him. Get him. Get him. Get him. Get him.

136
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:44,140
Oh my God. I'm out of bullets. Where's my boost? Got him.

137
00:28:54,019 --> 00:29:07,609
Okay. All right. Don't, I'm not going to fuck this up. I'm gonna take it really slow. Dead.

138
00:29:07,609 --> 00:29:23,289
Okay. I'm going to take it very slow. All right. Now I take these out. We're good.

139
00:29:24,009 --> 00:29:28,579
Use the jump pads. Oh, I forget what they look like. What do they look like?

140
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:55,019
All right. Here we go. Shoot somebody. What are you doing? I was trying to lock on to everybody.

141
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:06,619
All right. We're good. All right. I, I beat the mission. I did it.

142
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:34,089
Still one more. Oh, right here. Okay. Break in up there. Launching missile at target.

143
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:58,539
Let's go. I did it. That is fresh. Oh, be prepared for close quarters combat.

144
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:05,779
The deals. Oh, those went through. All right. I got it. I got it.

145
00:31:13,849 --> 00:31:27,849
Who's talking. All right. This is, this is more of my speed here.

146
00:31:42,359 --> 00:32:21,500
All right. And scanning. What type of pie should I bake? Um, a pumpkin. Get over. Oh yes. Pumpkin

147
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:28,140
pie. The best. Um, pumpkin pie is good. I don't know if I'd say pumpkin pie is the best though.

148
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:39,079
Pumpkin pie is, I used to hate it, but now I genuinely love it. I love one piece of pumpkin

149
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:49,740
pie. No more than one. No more than one piece of pumpkin pie. That's overdoing it. Is there

150
00:32:49,740 --> 00:33:04,650
a boss up here that I have to, would you ever do infomercials? Oh, a hundred percent. Yeah.

151
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:06,789
I was thinking about doing that recently.

152
00:33:15,339 --> 00:33:18,299
A supply Sherpa. Oh, is this going to give me full heels again?

153
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:35,430
That sounds pretty great. Have you seen Evangelion? I have not. I've seen pieces of it.

154
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:44,250
I've seen the final scene. I've seen the last sequence of that show. All right, here we go.

155
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:52,390
Uh, do I have a checkpoint here or do I get to really lock it in? I'm going to really,

156
00:33:52,390 --> 00:34:15,739
I'm going to lock it in. Great. Oh, I thought you guys were all calling me rusty at the game

157
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:27,369
because I haven't played it in a while. This is what you're talking about. All right, let's do it.

158
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:55,190
Got it. Blind spot like right here. Oops. Get right up in there with the shotgun,

159
00:34:55,190 --> 00:35:24,010
right in the guts. Stay right there. Get them, get them, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack.

160
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:49,829
Hey, hey, hey, what? Why did that not hurt? I know. I don't think I know how much shit I have left.

161
00:35:54,420 --> 00:36:13,130
The air conditioner's blowing all my hair in my face. My hair is all over my, it's in my mouth

162
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:48,710
and shit right now. I swear to God. I need boost right now. I did it first try. I win. I win. I did

163
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:56,500
it first try. I win the ultimate game of, uh, can you play Armored Core 6 and you're a live streamer

164
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:20,869
and you sit here and play these games and you suck at the ball. I win. Rude? No, I'm saying,

165
00:37:20,869 --> 00:37:25,960
I'm pretending to be you guys. Streamer can't do it. He sucks at everything. There's no way,

166
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:38,539
but I won. I did it. I was being you. Next boss. He's quitting. I'm calling it. I'm going to be

167
00:37:38,539 --> 00:37:51,590
the next boss just because you're here. First try. I'm not going to say first try, but I'm going to

168
00:37:51,590 --> 00:38:19,239
do it. You got stuck on the easy part of that mission. That's how it is though. It's like that.

169
00:38:24,659 --> 00:38:29,429
Bro, you're going to get filtered like water on the next boss. You know, you've been,

170
00:38:29,429 --> 00:38:35,820
you guys have been saying that this is the third boss now. At what point have you put me through

171
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:45,349
the water filter enough times where I am just, I'm just pure water. Like I'm going through the

172
00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:53,739
filter. Sorry. Uh, there's new stuff. I have a lot of money too. I don't know what this is,

173
00:38:53,739 --> 00:38:59,340
but I want it. Yeah. You trying to tell me I'm not going to buy this right now. I don't care

174
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:23,500
how bad it is. I like this too. New blade. I like that too. What about this thing? New training.

175
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:38,940
Yeah. I'll do the training. You get a parts for it, right? Ooh, go only melee build. I feel like

176
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:42,940
I've done the best with the melee because melee is just like, I kind of just don't even care.

177
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:47,900
I'm just going to go in and just swing. If I die, I die. That's kind of how I'm looking at it.

178
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:54,099
The next boss is the one. Apparently people have broken their controllers over.

179
00:39:54,099 --> 00:39:58,090
Really? Okay. I have to get in the right mindset because I don't, I'm not going to like get mad.

180
00:39:59,349 --> 00:40:04,099
I'm not, I, I'm not getting mad. This is going to be a, I'm just going to hang out and play

181
00:40:04,099 --> 00:40:10,739
games today. It's not, I'm not going to put any bite marks into this. Um, whatever, whatever.

182
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:15,139
If I lose, I lose. And if I lose 10 times in a row, I lose 10 times in a row. I'm accepting

183
00:40:15,139 --> 00:40:26,170
that right now. I'm not going to get angry. Okay. We're good. Just a little nibble.

184
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:40,469
Okay. Like I, well, who am I kidding? And I go like six bucks as he gets angry. All right,

185
00:40:40,469 --> 00:40:46,500
let's do it. You want to do a poll? Mods do a poll. Um, do you know what? Do a channel point

186
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:54,280
poll. Let's do it. Let's, let's go all in here. Uh, will I show genuine anger at this next boss?

187
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:58,699
Like, will I, but what does that mean? We have to get some ground rules here.

188
00:40:58,699 --> 00:41:03,030
Are we talking like, can I raise my voice? Can I say this is stupid?

189
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:17,380
What am I allowed to do? What's the condition? You, I think complaining is fine. Any negativity

190
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:26,420
at all. Kind of like Virgil, like the, like the Virgil rules. Okay. No complaint. But can I ask,

191
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:31,260
but here's the thing. Can I ask questions? Can I be like, I don't understand. Like,

192
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:35,500
why am I getting hit by that? Right. Like, that's a question. As long as I put a question mark at

193
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:42,099
the end of anything, I'm going to be fine. Fuck this stupid boss. Right. That's me asking a

194
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:50,789
question. This guy's such a piece of shit. Fuck you. These are all questions I'm asking. I'm not,

195
00:41:50,789 --> 00:41:58,250
I'm not getting angry. I'm asking a question. I think that's okay. You lost the last time you

196
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:09,610
did this. I know. All right. Um, let me just do the training. Loophole Larry. He's already cheating.

197
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:22,809
People think I'm going to, are we just going to move to coin game in like 30 minutes? Is that

198
00:42:22,809 --> 00:42:28,659
what you guys think is going to happen? Okay. Well, whatever. Let's see what happens. All right.

199
00:42:28,659 --> 00:42:43,269
Range weapons to both hands. The double trigger. Um, you hold them both. Oh,

200
00:42:47,099 --> 00:43:00,219
I've actually been looking for that. Yeah. This, this game is stupid. This game sucks.

201
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:15,349
I'm asking if you guys think this, I'm not saying it. Uh, I already knew that. Oh, right. I forgot

202
00:43:15,349 --> 00:43:20,869
you could that. All right. I have to apologize to everybody watching. Um, I forgot that right stick

203
00:43:20,869 --> 00:43:37,269
was lock on and I'd haven't locked down to a single enemy in 40 minutes. I forgot. Okay.

204
00:43:37,269 --> 00:43:41,590
Generator installed to your AC greatly influenced the rest of your assembly from the selection of

205
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:48,969
usable parts to the basic performance of the AC, right? A generator that prioritizes EN capacity,

206
00:43:48,969 --> 00:43:52,809
extensive use of aerial maneuvers. Okay. How do I get this one? I want this one.

207
00:43:52,809 --> 00:44:14,219
I like the extended use. You have it right now, but is it on my actual character? Okay.

208
00:44:14,219 --> 00:44:19,719
Fire control system installed X target tracking at close, medium, long range and missile lock

209
00:44:19,719 --> 00:44:24,739
on multiple. Okay. Specialized for close range combat, allowing it to rely on land attacks with

210
00:44:24,739 --> 00:44:31,460
its high firepower. Um, okay. So just saying like, go, don't fight things that this thing is a short

211
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:48,340
range. Like I completely missed that one, right? So that one is more medium short range. Oh, it is

212
00:44:49,059 --> 00:45:08,789
nice Ahmed. Cool. Weapons and selection of parts used to assemble an AC determinants,

213
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:35,320
ideal combat range in style. Yeah. I didn't, we already know this. I do unlock stuff for doing

214
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:43,880
this though. So it's worth doing. You're reading the tutorial message. Like you were explaining it

215
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:53,340
to a kindergarten class. Have you watched mob psycho? Like you said, you would know.

216
00:45:53,340 --> 00:46:08,440
I haven't seen the Smurfs movie either. What is that new generator? Uh, let me do all these.

217
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:22,420
Cause it's just going to unlock stuff. So just get them all out of the way. Reverse joint parts.

218
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:44,940
Yeah. Ooh. Okay. This is like a, this is like a hopper. You're like hop with this one.

219
00:46:45,579 --> 00:47:11,179
This one's actually pretty good. I feel like I would love this one. Okay. Is mob psycho any good?

220
00:47:11,179 --> 00:47:23,099
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. No sucks. This is going to be one of you. Yep. Three different types of

221
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:32,179
weapon category, kinetic, explosive, and energy. So they do different things. They do very different

222
00:47:32,179 --> 00:47:44,199
things. Cool. Look at that. I'm going to go like that. I'm going to go like that. Let's go ahead

223
00:47:44,199 --> 00:47:53,369
and get, can bounce, produce heat when fired. When overheated, the weapon will be temporarily

224
00:47:53,369 --> 00:48:17,289
disabled, right? Okay. So just don't overheat it. What is the overheat meter? Whatever those missiles

225
00:48:17,289 --> 00:48:30,469
are on my right shoulder are awesome. Okay. That's I can tell now. Ricocheting will occur

226
00:48:30,469 --> 00:48:35,590
when enemies have high defense, significantly reducing the damage they take. To counteract this,

227
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:39,909
try attacking at a closer range or switch to explosive weapons. I've been playing a lot of

228
00:48:39,909 --> 00:49:31,239
sorcery. I read things like I'm narrating a story. And charge. Okay. You excited for the

229
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:41,780
Five Nights at Freddy's movie? No, not at all. I'm just being honest. Ooh, laser handgun.

230
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:55,860
There's two more. I'm going to unlock everything. I love upgrades. I love unlockables. I love

231
00:49:55,860 --> 00:50:06,840
upgradables. Okay. Tetrapod leg units have high loading capacity and enable AC builds

232
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:14,280
equipped with multiple heavy weapons. Okay. They can switch to hover mode after, Oh, I have legs

233
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:40,380
now. Weird. Okay. I think I found the thing I like. How do I get this? Cause this is all I want.

234
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:51,210
I just want the, I want the floating machine. It's recoil. Yep. There's grenade launchers.

235
00:50:55,559 --> 00:51:00,280
They absorb this kind of recoil, allowing these techs to be with their, Ooh, I can go back to my

236
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:37,340
missile launcher now. Ooh, I will abuse this though. I think unfortunately you can stay up a

237
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:59,750
pretty long time too. That's actually great. There's still the dash though. That's fine. Okay.

238
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:07,849
I definitely think these are my favorites so far. And hover mode allows you to maintain a high

239
00:52:07,849 --> 00:52:12,489
altitude and turning in turn, making it easier to establish a line of fire and log on without

240
00:52:12,489 --> 00:52:23,780
geographical obstruction. Yes. A hundred percent. This thing is great. It didn't go up even higher

241
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:55,320
too. Ooh, cool. Do the multi-lock with the shoulder. A new grenade launcher. All right.

242
00:52:55,320 --> 00:53:13,019
What else? One more is tank ACs as well. It might be this one. I don't know. Heavily armored and

243
00:53:13,019 --> 00:53:18,440
boast excellent loading capacity. In addition to lending themselves to highly durable bills,

244
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:22,679
they're also good candidates for high firepower assemblies. Tank type ACs are capable of,

245
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:32,869
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. So it's just good. It just works well, I think. Oh yeah. This

246
00:53:32,869 --> 00:53:53,369
is the one. I'm just playing Twisted Metal now. Those that know, they know. Those that know,

247
00:53:53,369 --> 00:54:04,460
they know. And it was a great impression. You can drift. To execute a drift, move left stick

248
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:21,059
in the direction you want to face immediately after a boost. Hold on a sec. I'm boosting now.

249
00:54:24,380 --> 00:55:15,019
Oh, okay. So it has to be like, like that. I mean, it's okay. I get it. Let's go. He hates this.

250
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:22,780
No, I, okay. I prefer the other one, but I do. I like this one. This one's fine.

251
00:55:40,659 --> 00:55:54,300
This one's all right. This one's okay. Lock on. That's right. I forget it exists.

252
00:55:57,019 --> 00:56:06,309
New vertical. Oh, wait. There's a new training. I'm going to do it. Advanced mercenary

253
00:56:06,309 --> 00:56:21,940
certification. Adaptive assemblies. During real missions, you can expect enemy reinforcements

254
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:30,300
and other changes, right? Of course. Adjust to a wide range of combat scenarios. Sure.

255
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:42,760
Hold down right trigger and just fly. Is that not what I was supposed to do? Oh, I'm using my

256
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:52,150
regular loadout for a second. I forgot. I thought I had the other stuff on. Helps to remember what

257
00:56:52,150 --> 00:57:57,719
I had on. All right. Now here comes a tetrapod. Ah, fuck. I forgot. Oh shit. Did it work? Okay,

258
00:57:57,719 --> 00:59:02,340
cool. Shit. I didn't want to do that. Get over here. Ah, yes. Use lock on. I just did. Hey,

259
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:14,010
relax. Relax. Quiet. Congratulations. You have proven your skills by completing the entire

260
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:22,679
combat training regimen. Registration number RB23. Call sign Raven. All mind anticipates

261
00:59:23,079 --> 00:59:29,690
excellent. Don't lock on. It reduces your accuracy. You guys should figure this out amongst

262
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:42,420
yourself. I'm getting mixed information in the chat room. Okay. Where's the one where I can't

263
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:58,460
be mad? Wait, does this go for the whole time I'm playing? Okay. So I'm allowed to be angry right

264
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:12,820
now, right? Okay, good. I got to get it out of my system then. Okay. What did I get? New stuff.

265
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:20,139
I want to try the bubble gun. I feel like I'm playing Mega Man. I got the new Mega Man power.

266
01:00:20,139 --> 01:00:32,650
I want to use it. All right. I need help. Can I have some help? I want to ask another question.

267
01:00:32,650 --> 01:00:47,320
Can I ask a question? So this is damage. This is the Sekiro bar. This is the, uh, what's this one?

268
01:00:47,320 --> 01:01:01,989
That's the sustained Sekiro bar. And this is when, this is my overheat meter, which is pretty

269
01:01:01,989 --> 01:01:11,400
high right now. So of the really important shit. Okay. Attack, power, impact, and ammo.

270
01:01:13,159 --> 01:01:18,329
Those are the main important ones. There are no weapons that I have that overheat right now. Okay.

271
01:01:18,329 --> 01:01:29,849
That's good. So realistically it's just damage, Sekiro bar, ammo, how heavy you are, and how much

272
01:01:29,849 --> 01:01:35,190
boost you can use. That's what EN load is, right? Or do I have that backwards? Wait, no, no, no.

273
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:48,940
Okay. Boost speed, EN load, weight. EN is how much capacity you have. The weight limit for weapon

274
01:01:48,940 --> 01:02:05,960
energy. Okay. Which one of these is boost? Attitude? Stability? Okay. So this is essentially

275
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:17,559
Sekiro bar defense. Boost is under boosters. Okay. I just want to make sure I know what I'm

276
01:02:17,559 --> 01:02:26,170
doing here. All right. What about on this arm? What about the different laser blades?

277
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:42,500
This thing seems like it does way more damage. Oh, it only swings once, but I think I like it

278
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:59,800
better. All right. EN shortfall. What's that mean? That means I'm too heavy? Not enough energy.

279
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:21,019
This one's only four. That's one of the new ones I got, right? Get a better generator.

280
01:03:21,019 --> 01:03:31,480
Oh, that's right. We have arms and legs. All right. Booster generator. How much money do I have?

281
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:44,599
This one's better. This one weighs more. Okay. This isn't the shop. I know. I know. I know.

282
01:03:44,599 --> 01:03:56,219
I'm just trying to internalize a lot of this. Look at the thrust on this one. The upward

283
01:03:56,219 --> 01:04:19,860
thrust is terrible though. Should I try it? Close range assist. Help. My hand is up in the air. I'm

284
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:29,690
waiting to be called on. What does this mean? Aiming assistance performance at close range.

285
01:04:29,690 --> 01:04:37,239
Higher values improve aim when targeting enemies at close range. All right. So this is, I lose long

286
01:04:37,239 --> 01:04:47,500
range assist. Do I care though? I'll try it. I'll use this other generator. I'll put that on,

287
01:04:47,500 --> 01:05:03,400
whatever. This game is so customizable. How much money do I have? Look at all this stuff.

288
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:21,750
Medium range assist. I actually might want that. You can sell stuff you're not using.

289
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:30,860
Yeah, that's true. But let me just stumble. Let me just not look into that at all. Stumble through

290
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:39,260
the next few missions. Complain about the game. Not do any research on the chassis at all. Say

291
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:46,440
that the game is bad and that I don't want to play anymore. I think that's probably a good idea.

292
01:05:52,820 --> 01:06:03,539
Let's go. That's the way. This is the way. This is the way. I've done that shit before many times.

293
01:06:06,139 --> 01:06:17,380
I think I'm happy with what I got. It's going to be easy. You're too self-aware. Maybe.

294
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:45,909
These are baby missions. Why does your robot look so stupid? Hey, relax. Hey,

295
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:53,900
relax. I've said that a few times today. Hey, relax. All right.

296
01:07:00,730 --> 01:07:14,840
Are you going to do a nun cosplay? No. Why? Why would I do? Well, I mean, I guess I could do

297
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:20,199
nun cosplay for the release of that new movie. The new horror movie.

298
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:31,260
The Nun 2 in theaters this Friday. I have no idea when that movie comes out.

299
01:07:38,460 --> 01:08:01,059
Is that a real movie? Yeah. He's going to be a vampire for Halloween. Yeah,

300
01:08:01,059 --> 01:08:15,719
we already discussed that. I only got four minutes. Did I just friendly fire kill that person?

301
01:08:16,199 --> 01:08:27,189
4621. All right. Got one. I'll analyze it. Oh, cool. All right. More. This gives us some more

302
01:08:27,189 --> 01:08:49,989
insight about V4 skills. Oh, it takes a long time to load that one. I like the bubble gun a lot.

303
01:08:50,710 --> 01:09:10,380
I think it's fantastic. Okay. Some more evidence of a V4 situation. All right. Any more? I just

304
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:34,039
need to find a couple more, right? Not down here. There's one over here. Ow. All right. Give me,

305
01:09:34,039 --> 01:09:45,659
give me, give me. Where are you? Cut it out. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, cut the crap. Okay.

306
01:09:45,659 --> 01:10:10,140
Hey, cut the crap. Did I not get it? Oh, right. Somebody said you are so cringed.

307
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:37,399
Do I apologize? Do I have to say sorry? Hey, cut the crap. All right. There's one here.

308
01:10:39,939 --> 01:10:56,439
You're a corn ball. Um, yeah, I mean, whatever, whatever. Oh, I can't go that way.

309
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:34,420
Got it. Bubble gun is the best gun in the game. Okay. So is it more? I think I got everything.

310
01:11:34,420 --> 01:12:08,659
Didn't I? Did I knock everything? There's more in the hole. Uh, go into the pit. I didn't even

311
01:12:08,659 --> 01:12:19,479
know you could go down. Where's the other one? Where's the other one? Where's the other one?

312
01:12:19,479 --> 01:12:21,930
Where's the other one? Where's the other one? Where's the other one? Where's the other one?

313
01:12:21,930 --> 01:12:28,949
Where's the other one? Where's the other one? There's two, there's two. Did I do it? Oh,

314
01:12:28,949 --> 01:12:46,550
I did it. I got it. Okay. I thought I had to get them all. Two more optional ones. Um,

315
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:59,800
yeah, that was cool. I like how this is a snow level. Yeah, me too. What do we got?

316
01:13:10,579 --> 01:13:11,300
Filter incoming.

317
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:28,939
I wanted to take one hit from the boss and just talk about how like bad the game is,

318
01:13:31,130 --> 01:13:38,680
but I can't do that. I have to be real. People bet channel points on this. I have to be,

319
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:51,449
I gotta take it seriously. More upgrades. What was the, um, the ratio?

320
01:13:56,090 --> 01:13:59,930
Was it like two to one, three to one, four to one for I'm going to get mad to not get mad.

321
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:07,609
It was four to one, four to one to get mad or four to one. Oh, it's been refunded. Okay. I see.

322
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:18,439
We'll do it when we get up there. I see. Yeah. I can now do OS tuning and arena by OS upgrades,

323
01:14:21,399 --> 01:14:26,279
expend OST chips in your possession to upgrade your ACS OS from the OS tuning menu.

324
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:45,699
Really? Wait, control, quick turn. Oh, boost kick weapon bay. Wait, which one of these is,

325
01:14:46,729 --> 01:14:51,340
uh, would you guys say is very important? Probably this one.

326
01:14:53,060 --> 01:15:00,229
Boost kick. Oh, I don't have enough to do it. So that's cool. I'm imagining this is, uh,

327
01:15:01,109 --> 01:15:12,710
PVP probably is multiplayer or something like virtual battles against copies of ACS created

328
01:15:12,710 --> 01:15:19,420
using all minds, mercenary craft data from the arena menu. Well, this is how you get chips

329
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:33,720
invincible. Okay. It's one V one. So do you just go against people's creations? Is that how it

330
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:49,479
works? That's kind of cool. No. Yeah. Sort of do all those a lot of content in this game.

331
01:15:50,300 --> 01:16:19,909
Let me do this mission first. Those are dev creations. This level, this level,

332
01:16:40,649 --> 01:16:44,329
you buy the kick. No, I didn't. Didn't have enough.

333
01:16:55,369 --> 01:17:03,899
This level is easy. You got it. This level is hard, but it's not the filter. Okay. Then let me try

334
01:17:08,869 --> 01:17:22,250
you excited for the new saw movie. Okay. I saw, I saw spiral and I have to say, I can't. All right.

335
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:29,159
Does anybody care if I talk about spiral? Can I pause it? Can I talk about spiral for just one

336
01:17:29,159 --> 01:17:36,069
second? I don't, I'm not going to spoil the whole movie. I'm just going to tell you essentially,

337
01:17:36,069 --> 01:17:39,350
can I just talk about it for one? Look, just mute the stream for like a minute.

338
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:48,020
I'm going to talk about spiral or the book of saw. Okay. Um, are you ready? I'm going to talk

339
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:54,920
about spoilers for this movie. Uh, that movie did not need to be a saw movie. The only reason why

340
01:17:54,920 --> 01:18:01,079
that's a saw movie is because sometimes people would lean over and go, Oh, just like jigsaw.

341
01:18:04,409 --> 01:18:12,300
And they had a little bit of a soundtrack. That's that's it. Sometimes I want to say

342
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:16,819
probably three times over the course of spiral, somebody leans over and says,

343
01:18:18,699 --> 01:18:24,899
just like John Kramer, John Kramer did this before like saw. And then they do the,

344
01:18:28,659 --> 01:18:37,050
well, they explain the whole thing at the end of the movie at it. Like it's just, okay. It's just

345
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:48,380
like a saw movie, but it's like a soft like fan movie, by the way, they do say gas in saw too.

346
01:18:48,380 --> 01:19:04,899
I watched it pretty, I watched it pretty recently. It's a soft type movie, right? But look, I love

347
01:19:04,899 --> 01:19:10,180
saw. So I was like one of my favorite horror franchises, but you don't say this is a Jason

348
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:16,090
like movie. Oh yeah. Oh, Hey, by the way, everybody, all these people at this camp.

349
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:21,689
Yeah. All these people got killed just like Jason. You guys ever seen Jason? Like, Oh yeah,

350
01:19:21,689 --> 01:19:28,250
I have seen Jason. Yeah. Just like Jason. Like do we have to say that in a movie? That's not a Jason

351
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:44,380
movie. Yes, you do. It's saw adjacent Friday the 13th. Yeah. But okay. But if Freddy Krueger,

352
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:51,829
all right. Freddy Krueger invades your nightmares. It's me, it's me, Fred Krueger. I'm gonna slash

353
01:19:51,829 --> 01:19:55,939
you in your dreams. Right? Like we've, I've done that. You've seen, you've heard me do it before.

354
01:19:55,939 --> 01:20:04,420
If there was a movie that came out where it was like Steve Stevenson and he murders you in your

355
01:20:04,420 --> 01:20:13,449
dreams and he comes for you in your nightmares and he wears a sweatshirt. I mean, I don't,

356
01:20:13,449 --> 01:20:22,420
it's like, what, just why is Freddy Krueger not in this movie? No, no, no, no, no. Wait.

357
01:20:22,420 --> 01:20:26,739
Somebody's invading your dreams and killing you in your dreams. Just like Freddy Krueger.

358
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:39,399
I'm not in this movie at all. I don't spend one second. Yeah. Freddy Krueger. So yeah,

359
01:20:39,399 --> 01:20:48,329
I'm looking forward to saw X because I don't know. It's all right. I don't want to talk about

360
01:20:48,329 --> 01:20:55,659
sauce spoilers for the next. Like, do you guys remember? That's okay. I forgot about this until

361
01:20:55,659 --> 01:21:02,729
very recently. Number one, I forget that there are 10 saw movies. First of all, after the third saw

362
01:21:02,729 --> 01:21:09,380
movie, I don't remember a single one of those movies. What happens in soft four, five, six,

363
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:21,640
seven, eight, and nine. I don't remember them. They went from saw three to like saw 10.

364
01:21:22,699 --> 01:21:29,479
The other ones in the middle were just like, ah, I guess we'll like mutilate people in the,

365
01:21:29,479 --> 01:21:40,140
in the, you know, there's saw it's not saw, but it's saw. And I, I remember I look, I know what

366
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:48,760
happens. We're not talking all sauce spoilers. I know that after saw three, yes, it's and then

367
01:21:49,079 --> 01:21:56,279
mm-hmm. And then it's a mm-hmm. And then that person, mm-hmm. I know, I know the whole thing,

368
01:21:56,279 --> 01:22:03,529
but it's just funny to me that like, we have 10 of these movies and now we're even making ones

369
01:22:03,529 --> 01:22:07,779
that are in like the sauce cinematic universe that have nothing to do with saw, but it's just like

370
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:18,920
jigsaw like traps. And that that's all that translates to the other movies.

371
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:26,680
Anyways, I've said what I wanted to say. That's not accurate. There is something else I wanted

372
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:31,979
to say that I had as a drafted tweet that is never going to be tweeted, but I'm going to say it.

373
01:22:35,609 --> 01:22:39,289
I'm convinced the loud diarrhea I've had over the last few days

374
01:22:39,289 --> 01:22:48,300
is what's causing all these colitis ads I'm seeing now. That's essentially what I believe.

375
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:25,689
Yes, you can unmute the stream. Yeah. And I don't, I don't, I don't have to explain that joke.

376
01:23:25,689 --> 01:23:31,180
I'm not going to explain that reference. I do that too often. You're going to have to figure

377
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:43,159
it out on your own. All right. Where, where are we going here? Mute the stream? No, you guys can

378
01:23:43,159 --> 01:23:53,770
unmute. We're not talking about saw anymore. Oh man. I can't. No, no, no. We're done. Where am I going?

379
01:23:53,770 --> 01:24:04,649
They can't hear you. Well, that's too bad. Oh, wait. People were muted when I said that. Well,

380
01:24:04,649 --> 01:24:12,779
just people, 2000 people just probably clicked the clip button. Like they had like fucking potato

381
01:24:12,779 --> 01:24:16,699
chip grease all over their hands. And they like freaked out. They grabbed the mouse to go to the

382
01:24:16,699 --> 01:24:24,500
click, the clip thing as fast as possible. And yes, I'm overgeneralizing that you're all eating

383
01:24:36,619 --> 01:24:47,140
I know where it is. It's right there. I actually am. Yeah. You know what? Me too. Me too. I got

384
01:24:47,140 --> 01:25:05,479
to wipe this off. Me too. Okay. I got to stay right near this. Whoa. Okay. I think this is just

385
01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:46,020
they are where, where I killed it, right? He's actually doing like really well considering.

386
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:51,430
I know. I thought he was going to do much worse than this. God. I just love being a germamite.

387
01:25:52,310 --> 01:26:27,989
Don't you? Yeah. Why'd you do that? There were people in there. Stop. This is going to pop out

388
01:26:27,989 --> 01:26:55,720
of nowhere, right? You're annoying. Fine. That's fine. I got it.

389
01:26:57,159 --> 01:27:14,489
Yeah. How are those for tricks? Are you talking to yourself? Yeah. I thought he was going to

390
01:27:14,489 --> 01:27:34,020
teleport over here. What are the bubbles do? They do damage and they go close enough.

391
01:27:46,409 --> 01:28:10,460
You're full of noises tonight. Just chilling. Good thing. I've got fucking liquid reflexes.

392
01:28:46,149 --> 01:29:19,380
Whoa. Where is he? Where are you? Where is this guy? Oh, you're up there. Okay. Shit. I missed.

393
01:29:29,720 --> 01:30:25,460
You guys are annoying. Like they're annoying. Where'd he go? Okay. Dad, what's wrong?

394
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:48,060
Oh, cause I said annoying. I called the video game enemies. Annoying. What is our charger sword?

395
01:30:48,619 --> 01:31:01,270
Response. Let me check. Let me test it. Oh, that is way better than whatever the hell I was doing.

396
01:31:01,909 --> 01:31:16,890
How did you not know? Uh, I think it's cause it said it had one swing.

397
01:31:16,890 --> 01:31:22,100
So I just assumed that there was not a second swing, but if you charge it, you do too.

398
01:31:22,420 --> 01:32:35,850
Is this a boss fight? I see him. I got it working on it. Oh, fuck off. Ow, ow, ow. I'm dead.

399
01:32:36,890 --> 01:32:54,310
Okay. Well I get it now. Build might not be great here. Oh, I think I'll be okay.

400
01:32:57,909 --> 01:32:58,710
All right. Let's go.

401
01:33:19,220 --> 01:33:32,090
Oh, behind you. All right. So it's three of them. Are there a small, where's the smaller one?

402
01:33:32,090 --> 01:34:06,039
All right. Four of them. Yep. Oh, come on. Go please. There's one back here.

403
01:34:08,229 --> 01:34:16,420
Where are you? Where are you? I just saw you before. Where'd you go? Oh, right here. Nope.

404
01:34:16,420 --> 01:34:47,239
That's the big one. Oh, they are so high up. Oh shit. Okay. Just the big guy, right?

405
01:34:50,140 --> 01:34:59,750
Nope. There's another one. Where is he? There you are. Okay. Now it's just you.

406
01:35:00,550 --> 01:35:21,159
Did that not hit? All right. There we go. Much, much better than last time.

407
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:37,880
Bubble gun helps a lot. It feels like it's pretty good. You don't have to be super accurate. It's

408
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:56,409
just kind of a lot of expenses, but whatever. All right. Have I made it? Is it time? It's time.

409
01:35:56,409 --> 01:36:04,600
It's actually time. Perhaps. Okay. I got to think of only happy thoughts.

410
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:16,600
The lucky charms, marshmallows that turn into different like dragon coins when they hit milk.

411
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:18,359
That makes me really happy. I'm good.

412
01:36:18,359 --> 01:36:39,819
Ah, that kind of hurt. That hurt.

413
01:36:47,050 --> 01:36:52,250
Aren't you like 40? Yeah, I am. And I'm allowed to make funny little jokes.

414
01:37:08,680 --> 01:37:09,479
Funny.

415
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:26,010
Okay. So I am being pinged by a mod right now. And it's like, dude, go do those arena missions,

416
01:37:26,010 --> 01:37:31,369
please. Because the upgrades that you get there are going to make your life much easier.

417
01:37:34,279 --> 01:37:43,020
All right. Let's do this. I don't meet the conditions to fight this person. Why not?

418
01:37:43,020 --> 01:37:50,710
Oh, it's a ranking system. Oh, okay. All right. Let's go. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it.

419
01:37:59,609 --> 01:38:05,189
Mod that mod. So these are just 1v1 challenging fights.

420
01:38:06,789 --> 01:38:34,840
Mad stomp. Okay. Let's do it. Holy shit. You were so easy. I don't, I'm not even gonna,

421
01:38:35,399 --> 01:39:14,569
you're not even gonna hit me once. Anybody else coming up here to fight? Easy, easy, easy, easy.

422
01:39:16,939 --> 01:39:29,779
Say that now. Let's do all these. You get the emblems too. That's funny. They're very fun.

423
01:39:29,779 --> 01:39:42,229
That was really fun. Wait, do I just get 17,500 gold? I can do it as many times as I want.

424
01:39:49,819 --> 01:39:58,140
Like many other dosers, Rummy is utterly addicted to coral based drugs. And his perpetually addled

425
01:39:58,140 --> 01:40:06,779
state. He has convinced himself that he is an invincible demigod. Even should reality intervene

426
01:40:06,779 --> 01:40:12,359
with a costly defeat, he will forget about the setback entirely by the next day. Only death can

427
01:40:12,359 --> 01:40:20,869
dispel his notions of invincibility. Geez. Okay. Blue collar worker who was involved in the

428
01:40:20,869 --> 01:40:26,470
construction of the grid. He's now dedicated to establishing symbiosis with the coral and

429
01:40:26,470 --> 01:40:34,329
building a future for Rubicon free from planetary closure. Inspired by father Dolmean's ideals.

430
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:51,750
Kick his ass. Lock on. I locked on. I was locked on almost the whole time. I am locking on. I am

431
01:40:51,750 --> 01:41:59,050
locking on. Look, I just did it the whole last fight. Look, look. Come here. Aw. Maybe increase

432
01:41:59,130 --> 01:42:07,350
the camera turn speed. You only need to lock on once. That's true, but if they go out of my line

433
01:42:07,350 --> 01:42:21,109
of sight, I have to do it again, right? No. What? Wait, no. It just, oh, it just relocks. Okay. I

434
01:42:21,109 --> 01:42:29,399
didn't know that. That's good to know. Thank you. Appreciate it. Lock on is a mode. Maybe camera

435
01:42:29,399 --> 01:42:44,170
speed. I'm, I'm okay for right this very moment. I do agree that it could become a problem.

436
01:42:44,170 --> 01:42:53,960
Locking on makes your aim way worse. Yeah. Seems like there's one mind to do lock on and there's

437
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:59,640
one mind to never do lock on. I don't know which one of you are correct, but just do it. I'm just

438
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:12,840
going to do it when I think I want to. That's a myth. Are we, okay. Are we in the stage of

439
01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:17,000
From Software games where nobody really knows what actually is better? I feel like it would,

440
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:22,970
it's been a week or two. People should know by now, right? Or a bit. It does usually, usually

441
01:43:22,970 --> 01:43:27,210
like a month or two. We'll go by her. I think we still need to wait a little longer to figure out

442
01:43:27,210 --> 01:44:30,520
who's right. Um, I'll keep it on for now. Oh, that hurt a lot. No, no, no, no, no. No. Sorry. I'm

443
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:53,029
alive. Oh shit. I got really gritty at the end there. I almost had it. Went for a charged melee.

444
01:44:53,109 --> 01:46:22,140
Yeah. Don't get hit. Where, where is he? Where does he start? Oops. Oh shit. No, please. There

445
01:46:22,140 --> 01:46:52,899
we go. I did it. All right. I have a lot of chips now. So what are the good things to do?

446
01:46:59,109 --> 01:47:02,550
Somebody held their hand up and they were like, Hey, can I, I, can I say something that you didn't

447
01:47:02,550 --> 01:47:10,899
do in the tutorial? And they just went to the office. They got timed out. Excuse me, teacher.

448
01:47:10,899 --> 01:47:32,739
I have a question. Go to the office. Oh shit. They did that 20 times. I finally called on that

449
01:47:32,739 --> 01:47:56,550
student to send you to the office. I got a lot of money. What am I spending it on? Lock on is

450
01:47:56,550 --> 01:48:05,510
broken. If you move the camera stick, lock on moves the camera for you. Oh, get the legs. Go

451
01:48:05,510 --> 01:48:20,920
get the legs. That's right. Ooh. Should I do the tank? Nope. We're doing that. What should I sell

452
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:29,350
that? I don't care about that. I can just get back later. Do I care about anything on here?

453
01:48:29,350 --> 01:48:58,119
Okay. Way more health, way more stability. I need more energy. So, Oh, way too much. How

454
01:48:58,119 --> 01:49:07,689
heavy is the bubble gum? Bubble gun is pretty heavy, but I like it. I'm keeping it on. The

455
01:49:07,689 --> 01:49:19,779
blade is pretty heavy too, or doesn't use a lot of energy. This one's good. I like this one too.

456
01:49:19,779 --> 01:49:38,739
Disable one of the shoulders. That does work. I am going into, uh, apparently a really hard,

457
01:49:38,739 --> 01:49:47,270
really mad inducing boss fight. Basically lock on is a useful at your weapons effective range,

458
01:49:47,270 --> 01:49:50,949
but if the enemy is too close or too far for your weapon, it will be less effective.

459
01:49:51,510 --> 01:49:58,170
You could also buy a new generator. Just need generator. It's the most important part.

460
01:49:59,319 --> 01:50:09,430
Uh, let me go look and see what's even for sale. Okay. I need, I need a big bulky one,

461
01:50:09,430 --> 01:50:24,739
right? This, this thing is 416. How much is this one? 170 for the middle one. Okay. What should I

462
01:50:24,739 --> 01:50:37,619
sell? Yeah. I, and I can buy these all back, right? I can buy everything back. I'm not going

463
01:50:37,619 --> 01:50:47,260
to lose any of these. This is not okay. How much do I need? 170. I want to keep bubble gun and I

464
01:50:47,260 --> 01:51:10,020
want to keep, um, blade. I like the weapons I have. And now this thing is much more health.

465
01:51:10,579 --> 01:51:17,899
Generators work by how much they have at full capacity, but also how much they recharge.

466
01:51:17,899 --> 01:51:22,060
High recharge is going to be important for this boss fight in order to boost to dodge attacks.

467
01:51:22,939 --> 01:51:26,220
Also, if you want me to, if somebody got banned and you want me to, uh,

468
01:51:26,220 --> 01:51:33,020
unban them, that's not happening. Swap out the bubble gun. It's bad. Well, let me just see.

469
01:51:33,829 --> 01:51:46,680
Let me see. I got a bunch of new stuff. Somebody said the chest piece is really important with

470
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:54,979
this too. All right. I'm going. Okay. Hold on. Where's my generator? Okay. There it is.

471
01:51:54,979 --> 01:52:22,520
How was this one better? You don't have any back right equipment on. Is that bad? I'm still in

472
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:33,960
range here. No, I won't be. Bro does not get it. I'm, I'm doing fine. I've beat all the, look,

473
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:40,039
I might, it might not be perfect. It might not be exactly perfectly handled, but I have beaten

474
01:52:40,039 --> 01:52:43,800
every mission so far and I'm going to beat this boss and I'm not going to get angry.

475
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:52,409
We're just going to go for it. I'm just going to play it. And if I'm, if I can, if I lose,

476
01:52:52,409 --> 01:52:59,770
I can go back and, you know, re decide what I'm going to use. I'm not going to get angry.

477
01:52:59,770 --> 01:53:03,689
This is it. Is, uh, are we, are we, do we have the, is the poll ready?

478
01:53:04,890 --> 01:53:21,689
So I cannot get angry. I cannot complain. I think complaining is makes sense because

479
01:53:21,689 --> 01:53:30,630
I don't have a face camera and it's not turning on. Don't let people decide your build for you.

480
01:53:30,630 --> 01:53:39,689
No, I think I'm sticking to my guns here. You're gonna get angry.

481
01:53:41,399 --> 01:53:55,930
We'll see. Okay, here we go. We kind of need to wait. I want to, so this, this is currently

482
01:53:55,930 --> 01:54:04,279
8 million channel points saying that I will rage at this boss. I want to set the ground rules again

483
01:54:06,789 --> 01:54:15,590
going, Oh, or what? Oh my God. That's fine. But me saying, Oh my God, this,

484
01:54:16,069 --> 01:54:22,460
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, right?

485
01:54:22,460 --> 01:54:28,380
That has to be fine. Like, Ooh, I got hit by something. Oh, what? Totally.

486
01:54:29,180 --> 01:54:33,579
Shit. And now I'm going to talk about how stupid this is, right? That's the difference.

487
01:54:34,140 --> 01:54:47,449
I didn't even buy my chips. That's right. All right. Boost kick. Okay. How do I do that?

488
01:54:47,449 --> 01:54:57,159
L during assault boost is boost kick. What is this one? Ooh, you can take away the missile

489
01:54:57,159 --> 01:55:04,649
launchers and put regular weapons there. Weight control unlocks the ability to sortie

490
01:55:05,289 --> 01:55:30,390
when AC is overburdened. I don't get that manual aiming. Turn more armor. Salt armor is good.

491
01:55:35,270 --> 01:55:51,479
Second charge of assault armor. Quick turn fire controlled optimizes fire control. Oh,

492
01:55:52,119 --> 01:56:03,220
don't even don't show these to me. Wait, repair kits. I feel like I should do this.

493
01:56:04,729 --> 01:56:14,649
Either that or maybe speed dynamic deflection. This is just straight up damage mitigation.

494
01:56:14,649 --> 01:56:29,720
This is just 3% less damage overall. I'm going to do the heel. I have one more.

495
01:56:29,720 --> 01:56:36,920
I have people saying quick turn. I'm not going to use it though. All right. What? So I got kick

496
01:56:37,640 --> 01:56:47,500
quick turn. All right. So it's unlocked. I don't, do I have it installed? Is it installed right now?

497
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:54,020
Press L and Y at the same time. You have to equip it. You need to equip it. Okay.

498
01:56:56,390 --> 01:57:00,069
What does it do? Assault armor creates a pulse explosion centered on the AC.

499
01:57:00,630 --> 01:57:03,909
Cancelling out incoming enemy fire and creating a damaging area. It's such a big,

500
01:57:03,909 --> 01:57:09,350
like I just tasted a frozen grape and it was amazing by the way. I just like was in,

501
01:57:09,350 --> 01:57:20,060
I just tasted one. It was great. Okay. So where is it? Frozen grapes just don't ever leave your

502
01:57:20,060 --> 01:57:28,970
mind. Once you eat a frozen grape, it's there. It's in the back of your mind forever. It just

503
01:57:28,970 --> 01:57:45,399
is. I'm telling you, trust me. Um, okay. Expansion. There it is. I think I'm happy

504
01:57:45,399 --> 01:57:48,600
with this right now. I'm just going to, let me just see what the boss does. I'm not going to

505
01:57:48,600 --> 01:58:10,069
get angry. We're just going to check it out. Let's go. I'm ready. Stay positive. Somebody

506
01:58:10,069 --> 01:58:17,689
said, that's why I just talked about grapes. I'm not going to, look, this game is hard.

507
01:58:18,250 --> 01:58:24,920
It's a very challenging experience. From software made it. This is a boss that they made. It's,

508
01:58:24,920 --> 01:58:34,340
it's like millennia. We'll get upset. I am do emote only. Okay, fine. Emote only because I

509
01:58:34,340 --> 01:58:47,699
don't want any help either. I got my bubble gun. I've got my super launcher and I've got my sword.

510
01:58:51,560 --> 01:58:54,359
I choose this chassis because it looks like

511
01:59:03,960 --> 01:59:19,340
okay. There are things being fired every direction. This is it. Okay. We're good.

512
01:59:22,199 --> 01:59:41,500
Ouch. That hurt. Ouch. I'm going to try that again. Okay. Everything is good. We are doing cool.

513
01:59:42,619 --> 01:59:58,899
One sees you. Who saw that by the way? And you didn't even see that.

514
02:00:24,250 --> 02:00:57,270
Easy. Hold on. I like floating around like this. This is great. That thing is huge up there.

515
02:01:12,979 --> 02:01:37,659
Oh, look out. Got it. They said to be patient. Everything is good. We're doing fine. Part two.

516
02:01:37,819 --> 02:01:49,939
Waiting for combat. You're exposed to snipers from all quarters. Oh my God.

517
02:01:55,270 --> 02:02:17,829
What's happening right now? I, uh, I'm still alive though. I just have to make it to the boss.

518
02:02:18,390 --> 02:02:40,550
Okay. That's it. One more. Where are you? Oops. What? I'm on it. I'm out of bullets.

519
02:02:51,189 --> 02:03:00,199
Good. I'm not bad. I'm going to get a checkpoint here. So I'm fine with this.

520
02:03:00,680 --> 02:03:17,850
That's the watch points control center. Targets inside. How do I reload weapons? Can you spell

521
02:03:17,850 --> 02:03:33,539
it out to me in emotes? How do you reload? Okay. It's Y plus the weapon button. Oh,

522
02:03:33,539 --> 02:03:39,100
this thing can't be reloaded. That's just how much ammo is left total. Thank you. Appreciate

523
02:03:39,100 --> 02:03:51,130
the help. All right, here we go. Something's going to blow the bridge up while it's running.

524
02:03:51,689 --> 02:04:22,420
What is that thing? Is it a bubble gun? Oh, I see. You're very smart. You have a bubble gun as well.

525
02:04:29,609 --> 02:04:38,329
He's an independent mercenary who survives. 621 kills you.

526
02:04:55,609 --> 02:05:56,979
Where'd he go? I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. He flies around.

527
02:06:00,310 --> 02:06:04,789
That was sloppy. It's the first time I've ever seen this guy. I'll get him.

528
02:06:15,420 --> 02:06:22,140
He has bubble gum. Anybody else have this problem when they play games like this?

529
02:06:22,859 --> 02:06:28,220
I forget what the weapon is on top left sometimes, and I go, wait a minute. I have that.

530
02:06:34,619 --> 02:06:39,850
No, no, no, no, no. I'm seeing a lot of yeses though. All right, let's go.

531
02:07:00,199 --> 02:07:05,560
Whoa, whoa. Wait, I can. What's going on? Oh, I can. I thought this was death if I fell in here.

532
02:07:11,930 --> 02:07:31,239
Shit. I got staggered. Damn it. That's, that's not angry. That's an exclamation.

533
02:07:31,239 --> 02:07:45,739
That's not angry. We already agreed that we, I could do that. Oh.

534
02:08:16,390 --> 02:08:53,659
Ah, kind of a little. Hit him with that. Easy, easy, easy. Do not get hit by that.

535
02:09:06,069 --> 02:09:28,760
Did I do it? Did I beat him? How'd I do? Okay. I feel very happy right now.

536
02:09:29,479 --> 02:09:34,199
I'm not angry or anything. Things are well, things are going very well.

537
02:09:35,460 --> 02:09:50,789
I thought that just kills me. That would have been really sad. Okay. Am I going the wrong way?

538
02:09:51,770 --> 02:09:59,180
Oh, I was reading chat. I thought I did it. I was looking for all the pog champs.

539
02:10:01,289 --> 02:10:16,739
Wait, can I take like a chip out of this? No. Ah, that was just part one. I see.

540
02:10:21,779 --> 02:10:34,779
Hmm. He got through part one, but how will he do it? Part two is the scary part is a supply.

541
02:10:45,239 --> 02:10:49,000
All right, well, let's go. What is it? It's probably a giant snake.

542
02:11:19,750 --> 02:11:41,939
How do I do that? That was really loud. That was super loud.

543
02:11:49,289 --> 02:12:21,079
Here comes the real boss. The ground's going to be lava. I probably have to do this level

544
02:12:21,079 --> 02:12:23,479
in complete darkness, which is why everyone thinks it's hard.

545
02:12:43,289 --> 02:12:55,800
Wake up. R.T. Thanks R.T. for the raid. Welcome everybody. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome.

546
02:12:55,800 --> 02:13:03,739
We're playing Armored Core 6. I've not died once, so it's actually pretty interesting.

547
02:13:03,739 --> 02:13:12,409
Welcome to the gamer zone. Oh, it's emote only. They can't even talk. Well, thank you nonetheless.

548
02:13:19,720 --> 02:13:25,369
Yeah, it's weird. People are saying, dude, this is so hard. So I've been,

549
02:13:25,369 --> 02:13:29,210
I've been playing this game with my feet the whole time. Like it's been going pretty well.

550
02:13:30,550 --> 02:13:43,140
It's kind of hard, I guess, when you play like that. Oh, all right, here we go.

551
02:14:21,699 --> 02:15:40,579
How could I have missed? Oh, is this thing out of bullets? It's almost empty.

552
02:15:41,300 --> 02:15:55,579
Okay. So that was interesting. So the big problem is trying to dodge those. I didn't

553
02:15:55,579 --> 02:16:02,340
know they were homing missiles, but now I do. I know they home and I think you just run them.

554
02:16:18,859 --> 02:16:46,729
Where are you? I got an, oh, here we go. Here we, here we go.

555
02:16:47,530 --> 02:17:17,719
Ow. My goodness. That hurts a lot. I didn't get hit by any of that time.

556
02:17:47,909 --> 02:18:02,069
Whoa. Well, that hurt. What was that move? Question. Okay. 50%. That's not bad.

557
02:18:03,530 --> 02:18:06,489
Happy Hob with a raid too. Two big raids back to back. Thanks guys.

558
02:18:06,489 --> 02:18:18,840
Appreciate it. I'm thinking that I'm trying again. Welcome all raiders. I got to get this down.

559
02:18:39,770 --> 02:18:43,940
Crap. If you get hit once here, it hurts a lot.

560
02:19:08,709 --> 02:19:52,500
All right. I need shield breakers. This, this ain't cutting it. Ow. Yeah. I need anti-shield

561
02:19:52,500 --> 02:20:04,819
and I need explosive. Yeah. We're changing it up. Oops. I'm not angry. I'm just a little

562
02:20:04,819 --> 02:20:12,340
surprised at what just happened. Everything is okay. I'm just a little surprised. Oops.

563
02:20:13,299 --> 02:20:21,139
I just wanted to get back out here as fast as I could because I wanted to change this stuff

564
02:20:21,139 --> 02:20:33,559
very quickly. All right. I need anti-shield. I'm good. I'm good. I just was surprised that

565
02:20:33,559 --> 02:20:46,709
that's what I just did. So what do I need? I need shield impact. There it is, right? All right.

566
02:20:46,709 --> 02:21:05,899
Impact. Drop that shield. No, I'm seeing a lot of nay. Nay, nay, nay. No, no, no. Don't do this.

567
02:21:09,930 --> 02:21:23,559
Isn't that what that means? Because people were saying the bubble gun is really good

568
02:21:23,559 --> 02:21:28,500
against the shields, but I don't use it that effectively. I always burn it out.

569
02:21:28,500 --> 02:21:43,799
Let me take a look. Hold on. Impact. What has the most impact? Probably some of these.

570
02:21:43,799 --> 02:21:59,399
There's way too many yays and nays here. I'm just going to do the thing I just did.

571
02:21:59,399 --> 02:22:09,239
I think that's what I'm going to do. I have to stand still for this, but

572
02:22:09,239 --> 02:22:15,799
I'll try it. What do I want on the other hand? The sword is really good, though. I love the

573
02:22:15,799 --> 02:22:23,139
sword of this so much. Grenade launcher, maybe? Let's do grenade, grenade. Okay, this is bazooka

574
02:22:23,139 --> 02:22:28,680
and this is grenade launcher. What does this one do? Yeah. Yeah, fuck it. We're doing this one too.

575
02:22:28,680 --> 02:22:48,729
That's what we're going for. It might be dumb, but I'm very surprised at what I just did,

576
02:22:49,780 --> 02:23:11,819
and that's my own fault. Nobody else's fault but mine. I'm ready. I got two big missile launchers.

577
02:23:13,829 --> 02:23:30,100
I've got two missile launchers now. Way better. Way better. I mean like a hundred times better.

578
02:23:42,299 --> 02:24:21,420
Oh, I ran out of juice. Did I miss? Come on, do it. Okay, I do have to fight that.

579
02:24:21,420 --> 02:24:22,540
I have to fight that guy again, don't I?

580
02:24:22,540 --> 02:25:35,620
Oh, ow. Die. Got it. Where? Okay, we are good. Fight the boss. Well, the mini boss. Let me get

581
02:25:35,620 --> 02:25:51,639
it right. I'm going to lose here, right? It's okay to lose here. There's the kick.

582
02:25:52,280 --> 02:25:58,940
It's the first time I've seen that. All right, let's see. Maybe I can do it first try with half

583
02:25:58,940 --> 02:26:47,239
health. I almost got it. Damn it. All right, he's a little fast. I wasn't planning on beating him

584
02:26:47,239 --> 02:27:10,329
this time anyways. I had half health. These things are slow. I just need to get to the

585
02:27:10,329 --> 02:27:34,870
checkpoint for the boss. All right, three hills. I'm ready. Let's go. All right, I got to get above

586
02:27:34,870 --> 02:27:54,969
you. You're so quick. Shit, I'm never going to hit this guy. I am never going to hit this guy.

587
02:27:55,930 --> 02:28:36,920
He's too fast. Shit. One good hit and this guy is dead. All right, we're okay. Come on,

588
02:28:36,920 --> 02:29:17,770
that didn't hit. I haven't even hurt him. Oh, that was good. Ah, point blank. I'm right in

589
02:29:17,770 --> 02:29:32,299
the face. Come on. I got him. I got him. I got him. I got him. That hurt a lot.

590
02:29:44,579 --> 02:29:50,180
He stopped bumping into me. He's bumping into me. He keeps just driving into me.

591
02:29:58,920 --> 02:30:16,170
No. All right, this is a bad loadout against this guy. It takes too long to shoot this guy

592
02:30:16,729 --> 02:30:26,969
with this loadout. I can do it. I can do it. I can do it. Look how close I just got it. I'm good.

593
02:30:28,729 --> 02:30:32,569
Yeah, let him out of emote only. I want to see their anger. I want to feel it.

594
02:30:47,129 --> 02:30:55,000
I'm just chilling. I'm doing fine. All right, my gun was just in his body.

595
02:31:17,450 --> 02:31:28,729
Which ones did I kill? I wonder. Somebody said boost kick. Oh, I just tried it.

596
02:31:30,139 --> 02:31:58,260
Probably does a lot of damage. Where'd he go? Boost kick scales with weight. Oh, shit. Oh,

597
02:31:58,260 --> 02:32:07,319
the bubble ward. That's a good idea. Somebody shoot somebody at him. I didn't have any bullets

598
02:32:07,319 --> 02:32:18,969
left. Shit. Okay, this is not going to work. I'm just understanding that right now. Yeah,

599
02:32:18,969 --> 02:32:25,510
it's way too fast to use these weapons. Okay, so here's what we're going to do. You don't need

600
02:32:25,510 --> 02:32:39,190
to quit. It's okay. It means I have to do it again. What are the problems? Okay, the problems

601
02:32:39,190 --> 02:32:55,750
are they're too slow. So I honestly think this was fine. I think the bubble gun was actually doing

602
02:32:55,750 --> 02:33:00,870
pretty good. I mean, I beat him with the bubble gun. I can't beat him with these two. I'm going

603
02:33:00,870 --> 02:33:16,229
to keep it on. I need just something to like do double bubble. I think you might be onto something.

604
02:33:16,790 --> 02:33:31,319
I'm going to try it. I'm going double bubble. Just need to buy the other one, right? Yeah.

605
02:33:31,319 --> 02:33:51,959
All right, we're going to go double bubble. 90,000. I don't need this. That one's on.

606
02:33:52,600 --> 02:34:04,059
All right, double bubble. This is fine. This can stay on. All right, what about this stuff?

607
02:34:04,059 --> 02:34:13,479
I feel like I need to go to like armored core school for three weeks so I can get my doctorate

608
02:34:13,479 --> 02:34:33,860
in armored core. I'm kind of too heavy. I think this is good. I mean, I kind of have... Wait.

609
02:34:44,020 --> 02:34:53,530
I mean, this thing that you are so, so much lighter, but obviously all that capacity is

610
02:34:53,530 --> 02:35:02,329
gone and I want the capacity. Apparently too heavy though. How do I drop some weight?

611
02:35:02,329 --> 02:35:11,500
Get rid of one of these? No, I have a better idea. I'm changing my entire play style.

612
02:35:11,500 --> 02:35:27,110
Everything is changing right now. Here's what I'm going to do. We're doing double sword. I'm doing

613
02:35:27,110 --> 02:35:38,040
sword on left, sword on right, and then big missiles in the back. That's not possible. Oh,

614
02:35:38,120 --> 02:35:47,379
it can't be done. That can't be done? Okay, well I'm going to do... That can't be done.

615
02:35:47,379 --> 02:36:01,399
Try to stick with what I know. You know what? I feel like this thing is good. Get the weapon bay.

616
02:36:01,399 --> 02:36:18,870
I don't have enough. And now I'm going to do this. I'm going to try this. I want to be able to move

617
02:36:18,870 --> 02:36:36,979
around. Let's try that. I have to start the mission over again. All right, so do not quit

618
02:36:36,979 --> 02:36:45,350
the mission. Just die, go to continue, and the continue screen has... Stop touching the camera

619
02:36:45,350 --> 02:36:52,389
stick when locked on. Yeah, but you are talking about 30 years of me tracking with the right

620
02:36:52,389 --> 02:37:12,120
stick. You're going to take a while to get used to that. See how this is. All right, so now that's

621
02:37:12,120 --> 02:37:33,799
good. See how this works now. A little bit faster. All right, get rid of that thing. Did I hit it?

622
02:37:34,520 --> 02:37:46,219
Okay, I forgot what my entire loadout was. I was just shooting as if I had the grenade

623
02:37:46,219 --> 02:38:04,020
launcher on still. Okay, left trigger is sword. Did I dodge into that? My goodness.

624
02:38:09,500 --> 02:38:33,350
Right trigger is just regular shoot gun. Left trigger is sword. Okay, that was very sloppy,

625
02:38:33,350 --> 02:38:49,989
but it's all right. Now fighting this guy will be a lot better. I mean, I'm going to lose,

626
02:38:49,989 --> 02:39:59,610
but it's fine. All right. Let's go. You're talking like you're reassuring a kid in a storm,

627
02:39:59,610 --> 02:40:07,850
like those loud sounds. It's thunder. Hey, watch this. Ready? Flash. One, two, three.

628
02:40:08,489 --> 02:40:15,530
Booger. That means it's four miles away. Feeling? Yeah. After you see the flash,

629
02:40:15,530 --> 02:40:22,409
count one Mississippi tube, and then you'll figure it out. Lightning's not scary now, is it?

630
02:40:35,610 --> 02:40:48,709
I mean, I planned on dying here, so it's okay. I want to go in fresh. Just kill me. I wanted to

631
02:40:48,709 --> 02:40:54,170
get killed right there. I've been playing for three hours. I thought it's been like 40 minutes.

632
02:40:57,799 --> 02:41:01,479
Time really flies when you hate fucking everything possible about a game and can't

633
02:41:01,479 --> 02:41:13,879
stand playing it, and you're only playing it for views. Wow. I'm kidding. Stop that. I'm

634
02:41:13,879 --> 02:41:40,899
kidding. That was very clearly a joke. Here we go. Where am I?

635
02:41:46,469 --> 02:42:06,569
We're 619 and 620. Dead? Which ones did I kill, I wonder? Double.

636
02:42:12,620 --> 02:42:46,409
That didn't even hurt him at all. Wow. There we go. All right. Now we're going to fight the real

637
02:42:46,409 --> 02:43:17,579
boss. Real boss. I'm probably going to die in this one, too. Now we're cooking. There's the

638
02:43:17,579 --> 02:43:29,020
supply. Don't quit. Don't quit. I won't quit. I won't. I won't. I'll make sure I get it right.

639
02:43:29,020 --> 02:43:36,729
I know the last time I did that, at least a few of you had a bunch of papers on your desk,

640
02:43:36,729 --> 02:43:43,139
and you just threw them in the air. I know. You were taking notes on my performance, and it was

641
02:43:43,139 --> 02:43:46,500
like, all right, he did that like three times. Whatever. Just throw them up in the air.

642
02:43:47,059 --> 02:44:23,739
All right. Here we go. I'm going to try it with this. Should be good. I did it. You need to

643
02:44:23,739 --> 02:44:30,940
believe in the lock. Don't touch the right stick. Believe in the lock. I know, but I can't. I'm

644
02:44:30,940 --> 02:44:42,360
trying. I promise I'm trying. No cam means you can rage in silence. I have actually not. You know,

645
02:44:42,360 --> 02:44:49,299
you guys talked this up so much. This is like a filter. I don't think you guys should have said

646
02:44:49,299 --> 02:45:04,020
anything, because I probably would have been like, what's going on here? Now I know this one's a

647
02:45:04,020 --> 02:45:27,770
hard one. I'm just trying to watch the missiles come in. All right. I'm locked on right now. I'm

648
02:45:27,770 --> 02:45:35,020
not going to hit any of the right stick or anything. This is going way, way worse than

649
02:45:35,020 --> 02:46:59,059
last time. Oh, I'm already out of boost. All right. Here come the missiles. Oh, I'm dead.

650
02:46:59,059 --> 02:47:20,729
Okay. That's 50%. Okay. Stop touching the right stick. That's a large ask. It really is.

651
02:47:21,370 --> 02:47:42,010
It's almost making it harder for me. I mean, I'm not touching the right stick. It's weird to not

652
02:47:42,010 --> 02:48:03,989
have my thumb on that though, but I'm going to keep it up. Did that hurt? I think that kind of

653
02:48:03,989 --> 02:48:47,049
hurt. Ouch. I'm taking so much damage. Sometimes I feel like this game's like a war of attrition

654
02:48:47,049 --> 02:49:12,659
that I will always lose. Better than last time. Oh, that happens when? Okay. We're at 50% again.

655
02:49:21,209 --> 02:49:32,059
Different sword. Okay. What do I got in my hand right now? Let's go bubble.

656
02:49:32,059 --> 02:49:43,450
And then this one's eight. I'll do this one. I'm all right now. All right. Let's go for it. Here

657
02:49:43,450 --> 02:50:26,819
we go. Oh, okay. Bubble. I was getting better. I didn't want to do that, but it's all right.

658
02:50:38,459 --> 02:51:19,799
Oh shit. I'm clear. I'm clear. I'm clear. I'm clear. Am I? That hurt. Oh, that was a big move.

659
02:51:23,030 --> 02:51:27,110
What is this new move? All right. You have a gigantic sword now?

660
02:51:28,229 --> 02:51:45,750
Flamethrower. Okay. All right. All right. It's not even a big deal. That hurts.

661
02:51:46,549 --> 02:52:07,610
Come here. Come here. Come here. Okay. So phase two now has a gigantic fire sword. Good to know.

662
02:52:10,069 --> 02:52:30,629
Okay. Just keep the pressure up. No matter what. Pressure. Only pressure. Pressure. Pressure.

663
02:52:30,629 --> 02:52:33,430
Only pressure. Only pressure. Pressure. Pressure. Pressure. Pressure. Pressure. Pressure.

664
02:52:34,309 --> 02:54:10,379
Pressure. What happened? Oh, shoot. I had it. It's okay. We're good. What the heck? I forgot.

665
02:54:10,379 --> 02:54:15,559
I forgot. I forgot. I forgot. I forgot. I forgot. Oh my god. I'm just driving into it. I forgot

666
02:54:15,559 --> 02:54:18,760
everything. I forgot everything. It was so clean. That first wave was so clean too. And I forgot

667
02:54:18,760 --> 02:54:36,280
everything. I was so locked in trying to like fight that I forgot of the other moves. Oh,

668
02:54:36,280 --> 02:55:19,750
that's fire. I forgot he did those moves. It's okay. It's all right. It's all right. It's all

669
02:55:19,750 --> 02:55:22,389
right. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. I got it right here. Everyone

670
02:55:22,389 --> 02:55:28,819
relax. This is it right here. I got it. I got it. It's just phase two happened and I took

671
02:55:28,819 --> 02:55:33,819
two full health bars in damage because I stood there and went, what is this move?

672
02:55:42,469 --> 02:55:58,569
That. Hey, easy. Easy. Am I locked on?

673
02:56:36,409 --> 02:56:45,020
I forgot the moves again. I forgot them again, guys. I'm way too locked in.

674
02:57:11,430 --> 02:57:30,600
I didn't mean to do that. I forgot the moves again, by the way. Like if I just, honestly,

675
02:57:30,600 --> 02:58:05,829
I need to go write it on a fucking chalkboard and I'll be fine. Like a thousand times. Hey.

676
02:58:07,049 --> 02:58:13,260
Oh my goodness. Okay. We're fine. All right. Phase two, the swing happens. Phase two,

677
02:58:13,260 --> 02:58:19,340
the swing happens. Phase two, the swing happens. Phase two, the swing happens. Don't just keep

678
02:58:19,340 --> 02:58:25,319
playing like it's going to just be phase one. Don't get locked in phase two. We're good.

679
02:58:25,319 --> 02:58:29,799
Everything is fine. Everything is just completely good. We're good. Come on. Come on.

680
02:58:31,079 --> 02:59:36,379
Back up. I couldn't back up. I couldn't back up. I couldn't back up. I was staggered.

681
02:59:41,139 --> 02:59:47,940
I got it. I, all right. I am so confident that I'm going to beat this, but it's my confidence

682
02:59:47,940 --> 02:59:56,940
that's causing a huge problem. I have to be not confident anymore. Right? Like I have to be like,

683
02:59:56,940 --> 03:00:02,010
oh, it's not going to happen. I don't think it's going to happen. All right. I got it this time.

684
03:00:02,649 --> 03:00:47,190
Here we go. Oh shit. That's not good. This is a bad start. I don't know. I took too much damage

685
03:00:47,190 --> 03:01:13,690
there. Way too much. Do you have a sword in phase one too? I didn't know that. I wonder what the

686
03:01:13,690 --> 03:01:19,129
actual way to avoid that is. There's gotta be like a, oh, it's the meta way. It has to be some

687
03:01:19,129 --> 03:01:47,590
way to do it. I have no idea what it is though. Way too much damage. This, this, this one's,

688
03:01:47,590 --> 03:02:05,930
this one's not, this one doesn't count. Yeah, this one doesn't count. This one doesn't count.

689
03:02:06,489 --> 03:02:34,010
This one doesn't count. I tried to turn this like keyboard turning in world of Warcraft.

690
03:02:34,010 --> 03:03:05,379
It's just an observation. Shoot. Oh, oh, peanut butter. All right. Pull back. Pull back. Pull

691
03:03:05,379 --> 03:03:31,940
back. I thought it was me that did that to you, but it was you that did that to me. Why already?

692
03:03:31,940 --> 03:03:36,579
What? Oh my God. I'm kicking his ass. I didn't realize how much I was kicking his ass.

693
03:03:50,139 --> 03:03:55,739
I didn't realize this one was, I was just pressing random buttons. I thought this one was a,

694
03:03:55,739 --> 03:04:18,120
just like, I'm not going to do it, but whatever. You know, if I had like 10% more patience,

695
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:31,110
I would be doing a lot better. Okay. I'm going to, I'm going to go in with this 10% more patience.

696
03:04:31,110 --> 03:04:51,559
Let's try that. Is the character still in the game? Oh, okay. I was like, what the fuck is

697
03:04:51,559 --> 03:05:55,670
happening? Shit. I wish you weren't so high in the air. You can tell when it doesn't work.

698
03:05:55,909 --> 03:06:26,459
Oh, I couldn't even see it on the screen. Did that hurt? Kind of? Yep. That would have been

699
03:06:26,459 --> 03:06:54,950
great. All right. Patience. Patience. Have it please. I accidentally just pressed up on the

700
03:06:54,950 --> 03:07:03,719
D-pad. I don't even know how that happened, but I know it did. I didn't mean to press that.

701
03:07:04,520 --> 03:07:10,120
Uh, that's why I'm going to take this one as a loss.

702
03:07:24,620 --> 03:07:50,540
Oh shit. Okay. Um, so this is very, very, very difficult, but it's not impossible.

703
03:07:54,139 --> 03:08:00,010
I'm not even sure difficult is the, I don't think it's even necessarily that's difficult.

704
03:08:00,010 --> 03:08:06,040
It's that you are, you're, you're stepping on the gas. Your foot is all the way to the

705
03:08:06,040 --> 03:08:10,979
bottom of the car and it doesn't stop until the mission ends. I think you just,

706
03:08:10,979 --> 03:08:23,610
you have to be on point the whole, you gotta be on point the whole time. We're doing just fine.

707
03:08:24,250 --> 03:09:20,709
Okay. Here it is. Not bad. Pretty good start. Keep it up. No. Back up. Here we go.

708
03:09:22,629 --> 03:09:29,190
All right. Phase two, swinging incoming. Underneath it. That's exactly what I wanted to do.

709
03:09:29,909 --> 03:09:43,450
How many swings do you have? How many times does he swing? Oh boy. I'm out of dashes.

710
03:09:44,409 --> 03:10:00,760
Oh, you're doing way too many of those in a row. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up.

711
03:10:11,079 --> 03:10:23,459
No. What happened? What happened? I got hit by like a hundred missiles. What the hell?

712
03:10:42,200 --> 03:11:03,690
I hit him. I wish the lock on circle was like red. Sometimes it's hard to tell if I'm even

713
03:11:03,690 --> 03:11:16,549
locked on. Can I change that in the options? Can I change that? I wish I could make it red.

714
03:11:22,170 --> 03:11:29,479
I don't know how you reliably dodge those. It's just a hundred million of them. That one didn't

715
03:11:29,479 --> 03:12:15,930
count. Should I stay back from the missiles? Maybe? I don't know. They just spam. I guess

716
03:12:15,930 --> 03:12:40,090
like maybe just go. No. How are you supposed to dodge that? Okay. Just assault boost pass.

717
03:12:40,090 --> 03:12:45,370
Aren't they homing though? Yeah. They're like, they're like on me. All right. I had him. I had

718
03:12:45,370 --> 03:13:00,969
him beat. I just got to get back on it. Let's go. Start over. Does that kind of work? It uses so

719
03:13:00,969 --> 03:13:05,530
much. Look, and it's happening again. I don't have any more boost. No, I'm doing it my way.

720
03:13:23,450 --> 03:13:35,739
I wonder if I can, can I just outrun it? Maybe.

721
03:13:43,959 --> 03:13:54,069
I just hit every button on my, I hit Y, X, A, and V at the exact same time.

722
03:13:54,790 --> 03:14:09,700
It's just so much happening. I feel like I'm in a crashing plane.

723
03:14:18,600 --> 03:14:36,870
Is that anger? What? No, that was not anger. That was me making a joke. That was a joke. That was

724
03:14:36,870 --> 03:14:43,610
like a, I did funny noises. That's not anger. That's funny sound effects. You cannot be angry

725
03:14:43,690 --> 03:14:55,219
and make funny sound effects. That's not how it works. I got them down to like 1%. I'm going to,

726
03:14:55,219 --> 03:14:59,219
okay. Time to be quiet. Let's go. This is the one right here. This is actually the one right now.

727
03:14:59,219 --> 03:15:52,180
Watch this. What hit me? I'm so confused.

728
03:15:52,819 --> 03:16:09,639
So intensify, Raiden. Get clear.

729
03:16:28,889 --> 03:16:49,989
Here comes the swing.

730
03:17:14,680 --> 03:17:19,030
Do that quick.

731
03:17:34,729 --> 03:17:48,299
Oh my goodness. I can't believe I didn't get killed.

732
03:17:48,540 --> 03:18:00,020
Oh my goodness. You gotta be kidding me. Oh, it's okay. I'm not even mad about it.

733
03:18:00,020 --> 03:18:14,680
I can't believe it. I can't, I can't believe it. God dang it. Darn it. Oh, darn it. That's

734
03:18:14,680 --> 03:18:22,809
a big darn it right there. That was one HP. That's such a huge darn it. That's, that is like a,

735
03:18:22,809 --> 03:18:33,819
oh gosh, dang it. Oh, that sucks. I can't even, it's all right.

736
03:18:38,219 --> 03:18:42,139
Hey, we're good. Let's go. I'll do it again. I'll do it again right now.

737
03:18:49,799 --> 03:19:19,020
I'll do it again right now. Recharge, recharge, recharge, recharge. Why can't I recharge?

738
03:19:38,889 --> 03:19:44,790
Oh, damn it. I have to restart.

739
03:19:48,870 --> 03:19:57,989
Okay. Now I'm just, I, I, I, I need to do one hit. I can't believe it.

740
03:20:12,139 --> 03:20:13,209
Okay.

741
03:20:26,389 --> 03:20:35,719
Oh, get in there. What? That doesn't count.

742
03:20:49,399 --> 03:21:05,750
Here we go. More of this bullshit. Good start. I can't believe I didn't hit that.

743
03:21:06,389 --> 03:21:10,870
I wish I knew what happened there. I was locked on. It just didn't stay locked on.

744
03:21:13,540 --> 03:21:18,020
That's a complaint. I lose. No, I'm complaining now. That's a, that's actually a complaint.

745
03:21:19,719 --> 03:21:23,399
I didn't press the right stick. I didn't trip the lock on off. I'm complaining. It's over.

746
03:21:24,280 --> 03:21:36,809
Yeah, this is a complaint. I wouldn't necessarily say I'm angry. I would say I'm complaining.

747
03:21:46,809 --> 03:21:53,209
I'm going to put a, this weapon, uh, is, is ass against this enemy because yeah,

748
03:21:53,209 --> 03:21:58,010
give me a different, how do I do it again? How do I, how do I put a different weapon on?

749
03:21:59,719 --> 03:22:03,399
This bubble weapon is cool, but like, how are you ever going to attack somebody?

750
03:22:03,399 --> 03:22:09,860
Like he just flies around the whole map and at the range is like medium range. I'm yeah, it's ass.

751
03:22:09,860 --> 03:22:15,299
Hey, I not, I didn't get filtered yet. I had, the boss had one HP 10 minutes ago. Don't forget that.

752
03:22:16,100 --> 03:22:31,750
I ain't getting, no, this is bullshit. You take one of those. It's half of your entire health pool.

753
03:23:07,780 --> 03:23:25,129
My eyes are itching. Yeah, this, look at this. Okay. This bubble gun,

754
03:23:25,129 --> 03:23:30,649
you can shoot it for like a one second before it overheats. This thing fucking stinks.

755
03:23:34,229 --> 03:23:38,549
You go overheated. Oh my God. This thing sucks. Asshole.

756
03:24:03,319 --> 03:24:39,319
Okay. Come on. Come on. Shit. That, how did that even hit me? I dodged it perfectly.

757
03:24:57,799 --> 03:25:18,819
Still not good. I don't, I have like no health. All right. You know what? Kill me. Cause I,

758
03:25:18,819 --> 03:25:24,659
I want to take this bubble gun off. One, two, you shoot this thing for two seconds and it overheats

759
03:25:25,299 --> 03:25:32,329
in the middle of a giant fight where there's just shit screaming at you. And like missiles are

760
03:25:32,329 --> 03:25:37,129
shooting you from every single direction from every angle. It's hard to look at that tiny

761
03:25:37,129 --> 03:25:48,899
little bar to see if it's red. I'm sorry. It just is. Get this thing the fuck out of here.

762
03:25:48,899 --> 03:26:03,219
Sell it. Oh shit. I don't have anything. Is this even better? All right. No more complaining. Let's

763
03:26:03,219 --> 03:26:54,219
go. I'm trying to be so patient. There's just shit everywhere. Oh really?

764
03:26:55,180 --> 03:27:09,190
That's unfortunate. I need to get more heels. Probably. I feel like that's holding me back

765
03:27:09,190 --> 03:27:35,180
too. I already have one health. If you don't get to phase two without two, it's over. Okay. Let's

766
03:27:35,180 --> 03:28:00,899
pull back. I hit that. There's always one little straggle rocket. That's like, so you do through

767
03:28:00,899 --> 03:28:14,100
all this. And then it's like like that. Maybe you just, I'm just going to ski. I'm not even

768
03:28:14,100 --> 03:28:23,079
going to attack like that. Just drive. Does this work? Kind of. Oh no, it does not. Oh no, it does

769
03:28:23,079 --> 03:29:34,899
not. Okay. Good start. Very good start. Exceptional start. Oh shit. Okay. Ski, ski, ski. All right,

770
03:29:34,899 --> 03:30:15,399
back up, back up, back up, back up. Not bad. Not bad. Here comes the swing. Yep. What hit me? What

771
03:30:15,399 --> 03:31:23,899
hit me? What hit me? What hit me? I fucking lose. Oh no. Oh no. It's just got such an insane cone.

772
03:31:23,899 --> 03:31:44,229
It's like, it's like, it's like 300 degrees in front of this motherfucker. Again, like another

773
03:31:44,309 --> 03:32:04,219
2% boss fight. Give me a break. Be more aggressive. I feel like last time I've tried to be

774
03:32:04,219 --> 03:32:26,309
aggressive. He just kills me in two hits. Here, do the little sneaky, like, go on, do it. Do your

775
03:32:26,309 --> 03:32:57,579
little, there it is. Oh, you got it. I'm literally waiting for it. What the fuck is happening?

776
03:33:22,379 --> 03:33:27,180
Oh my God. He just almost double tapped me in one second. Holy shit. I got way too aggressive.

777
03:34:10,579 --> 03:35:06,229
What? Oh, already? That doesn't look like 50% to me. Holy shit. What? Where did, he just like

778
03:35:06,229 --> 03:35:15,639
scooped me up in the middle of his mouth. Oh my God. I can't believe I almost beat this guy with

779
03:35:15,639 --> 03:36:07,260
one health three times. You shoot behind you? Oh, come on. That's absolute fucking horse shit.

780
03:36:07,739 --> 03:37:03,799
It really is. Back it up. No, you fucking idiot. Stop flying directly over my head.

781
03:37:13,110 --> 03:37:18,709
Get away from my head. Get, get out of here. Go back to your corner. You're like, you're broken.

782
03:37:36,870 --> 03:37:41,030
Dude. What? I couldn't jump. What? Why couldn't I jump? I was trying to jump.

783
03:37:41,590 --> 03:37:48,700
He was like glued to the ground. What the hell happened? I, I was pressing A. How come I didn't

784
03:37:48,700 --> 03:38:49,319
fly? Was I out of, was I out of juice? Damn it. Fuck you buddy. I got like just caught up. That

785
03:38:49,319 --> 03:39:03,049
was so fucking stupid. He flew over me and I couldn't stay locked on. Come back when you're

786
03:39:03,049 --> 03:39:25,860
level 80. You don't level up in this game, do you? I need to grind side quest. I mean, dude,

787
03:39:25,860 --> 03:39:34,010
I have come one centimeter of his bar of health, like four times. I can do it. I just have to get

788
03:39:34,649 --> 03:39:50,069
the last hit in and just kill the guy. We're doing this right now. Like, holy shit.

789
03:39:50,709 --> 03:39:56,379
Give me a fucking break. Key, I'm literally keyboard turning in World of Warcraft.

790
03:40:14,200 --> 03:40:23,190
Okay. We're good.

791
03:40:35,930 --> 03:40:48,040
All right. Come on. This is the one right here. This is it. No more bullshit. I can't see anything.

792
03:40:49,020 --> 03:41:20,819
All right. We're good. Oh, come on. That's just so stupid. You just, sometimes you're just in a

793
03:41:20,819 --> 03:41:26,469
spot where you're going to get hit by that. Sometimes you just don't, you can't dodge anymore.

794
03:41:27,030 --> 03:41:42,680
This is un-fucking-bearable. This is boss number three. What does boss number 17 look like? Holy

795
03:41:42,680 --> 03:42:06,620
shit. Have any humans completed this game yet? All right. This is a good start.

796
03:42:27,590 --> 03:42:32,260
Huh? What? Oh, I got staggered by something. All right. Pull it together.

797
03:42:35,139 --> 03:42:48,149
Come on.

798
03:43:09,049 --> 03:43:14,440
What? Why are you stopping? I did not tell you to stop. Why are you stopping moving?

799
03:43:22,649 --> 03:43:31,510
Oh my god. I just got, my elbow was stuck on my chair. Hold on. I gotta move this. This is in

800
03:43:31,510 --> 03:43:56,489
the way now. Okay. There we go. That's better. I have free movement of my arms now. I might be able

801
03:43:56,569 --> 03:44:37,500
to do it. Oh, I'm out of juice. I'm out of juice. I need to build juice right now. No, dude. That's

802
03:44:37,500 --> 03:45:22,809
the exact thing I didn't want to have happen. Oh boy. We're good. I win. I win. Okay. How did I

803
03:45:22,809 --> 03:45:32,360
think I was ever going to get through that without complaining? I'm telling you, I put my, these

804
03:45:32,360 --> 03:46:01,110
things down. That's better. Phase three. Don't even say that. That was hard. Let me just bite the

805
03:46:01,110 --> 03:46:27,260
controller real quick. Cause you hear it? I was going like this. It was like gripping it like

806
03:46:30,540 --> 03:47:01,909
480,000 credits. Wow. That's pretty sick. Is he going to rage at the spider boss?

807
03:47:04,809 --> 03:47:08,969
Probably. I don't think we should do any more bets on that because it absolutely is happening,

808
03:47:10,729 --> 03:47:17,659
but we're going to move on to a coin game. I want to play coin game for like an hour or two.

809
03:47:20,260 --> 03:47:23,850
I got over the hump. I can come back to this if I want to.

810
03:47:25,620 --> 03:47:31,350
You said you could hear a strange voice in your head. I can see why that boss is considered a

811
03:47:32,629 --> 03:47:40,500
with the difficulty really turns on. That was fun. I like it. Do you like the game? Yeah.

812
03:47:42,459 --> 03:47:47,739
All the From Software games do this shit. They make you go through every stage of grief,

813
03:47:47,739 --> 03:47:53,100
question your reality, question, question everything. And then when you finally beat it,

814
03:47:53,100 --> 03:47:58,329
you go, that wasn't even a big deal. That wasn't even a big deal. That was nothing.

815
03:47:59,290 --> 03:48:15,450
It looks fun to be fair. I would say it's very fun. How red are you? Actually, not really.

816
03:48:22,840 --> 03:48:28,649
You probably can take on anything after beating that guy. That's encouraging. Hey,

817
03:48:28,649 --> 03:48:36,090
thanks guys. Sweat check. Uh, I don't, well, you can't, I can't do a sweat check.

818
03:48:36,170 --> 03:48:48,819
There's nothing to check. Check the messages.

819
03:49:02,090 --> 03:49:11,110
Only him and the next one are really hard actually, in my opinion. So wait,

820
03:49:11,110 --> 03:49:22,170
this is not the case of like boss 15 is not insane. Boss three is very difficult. And then

821
03:49:22,170 --> 03:49:25,850
is that, Oh, okay. It is. All right. I see. I see. There's one guy. All right.

822
03:49:26,569 --> 03:49:32,229
Boss four is ridiculous. Boss 15 is insane. The other bosses aren't. Okay.

823
03:49:36,149 --> 03:49:39,510
So it is what I was describing. So have you guys beaten this yet? I'm imagining

824
03:49:39,829 --> 03:49:45,110
virtual encounters are now available in the arena. We invite you to hone your technique.

825
03:49:47,350 --> 03:49:57,450
Yes. I have four times new mercenary data. Ooh, I unlocked new arena. Well, that's cool. I think

826
03:49:57,450 --> 03:50:05,219
that's a good stopping point though. I am a fan. I will probably stream it again. Just not right now

827
03:50:05,860 --> 03:50:10,260
because right now I want to play coin game. Coin game got an update a few months ago that I never

828
03:50:10,260 --> 03:50:13,899
played. I don't think it's anything too substantial, but there's at least another

829
03:50:13,899 --> 03:50:20,729
arcade, I think. So let's go check it out. If that's all you want to see for armored core,

830
03:50:20,729 --> 03:50:27,510
maybe I'll play it again at some point. But if I can beat that, then I think I can handle most

831
03:50:27,510 --> 03:50:32,459
of the rest of the game. So let's go play coin game. Actually, let me get, let me go pee. I'll

832
03:50:32,459 --> 03:50:42,780
be right back. And I'll come back with coin game. How does that sound? Sounds good to me. Um,

833
03:50:48,040 --> 03:50:49,079
all right. Be right back.
