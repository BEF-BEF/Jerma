1
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:08,179
All right, I'm back. Well, not quite. I'm gonna get a drink. I gotta make sure I got my tweet ready.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:17,690
I've never done this before. Gotta make sure I do it right. I gotta make sure my tweet's ready. Did he shit himself? All right.

3
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:25,100
Okay, fuck. Wait, I haven't started the sponsor stream yet. I haven't started the sponsor stream, but it hasn't started yet.

4
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:35,640
We're still on IRL. Don't, um, all right, enough. All right, enough. I have not started yet. So

5
00:00:36,600 --> 00:01:41,719
relax, quiet. Give me one, give me one more second. Hold on. All right, I'm almost ready. I'm almost ready.

6
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:49,049
I just have to change the, um, I just gotta change my game and the title.

7
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:52,739
He's acting like he's going to prom. This is, I've never done this before. This is a big deal.

8
00:01:54,650 --> 00:02:02,340
This is a big deal. Let me refill my drink and I'm ready to go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

9
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,459
Let's go. Let's go. All right, one more sec. He's going to prom.

10
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:46,539
I don't, I don't know why that was there. I don't know why that was there. Yeah, no, just take that out of here.

11
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:52,490
I don't know why. There's a pair, there was a pair of underwear just on my desk. What the fuck? Why?

12
00:02:53,370 --> 00:03:43,000
I don't know why it was there. Okay. I want to give one sec. All right. I think I'm ready. Hold on.

13
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:53,990
I gotta make sure my tweet's ready. Gotta make sure my title's ready. I'm, I'm honestly, I'm actually

14
00:03:54,550 --> 00:04:00,460
happy to play this. I'm excited to play this. I played the demo of this game and I was like, that was actually fun.

15
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:09,080
I like to play more of that. So here we are. What happened? I just got back. We, uh, moved on to a sponsor segment.

16
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:23,670
First time ever. I am pogging right now in real life and you'll see real quickly. Double checking the tweet.

17
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:43,769
I think that's fine. I think that it works. Okay. Okay. I'm not doing a YouTuber voice. Uh, no, I'm not doing that.

18
00:04:44,009 --> 00:05:05,959
All right. I'm ready. Tweet is going out. There it is. That's a legit, that's a legit sponsored tweet here. First ever.

19
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:23,850
I've never done that before. I don't have Twitter. Dude, get out, you gotta, what? Yeah, we got a hashtag ad.

20
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:38,629
Are you nervous? No, no, I'm not at all. It's team 17. Yep. He's corporate Andy. That's, hey, that's me.

21
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:44,329
All right, you guys ready? I'm at this, I'm actually very excited. This game is gonna be good.

22
00:05:45,139 --> 00:06:01,819
I played the demo. Please help with this. Can you see? This is a man size sponsor.

23
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:16,629
You should be able to see it now. Hey, you can see me at least. All right.

24
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:28,819
You ready? No, I'm not supposed to disappear. All right. So, well, what is this game? What is this?

25
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:34,459
Well, hold on a second. Let me tell you. This game is a game where you, uh, it's an action adventure game.

26
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:40,740
It seems pretty interesting. It's a game where you craft potions. The game where you, it's an action adventure

27
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,779
experience and it looks really fun. I did my research.

28
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:55,639
I played the demo. Might be too loud. It runs in 1,440 p.

29
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:24,360
Soundtrack is good. Don't swear. Stop swearing. Damn. All right, new game. Let's go. Uh,

30
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:35,100
I'm gonna play this person. Epic music. Oh, I gotta get, I gotta get the face cam off. At the crossroads of existence

31
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,100
there is a serpent that bites her own tail.

32
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:44,699
Stop swearing. You're making me look bad. And on, and on and on she gnaws without ending or beginning, only harmony.

33
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:53,290
And yet there are those who would be, who would sicken her and force her jaw open.

34
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:57,639
I'm waiting for the pogs because this is, I'm telling you, you're gonna like this.

35
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,540
Cycle broken, balance undone.

36
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:16,230
Until all that is left is the poison of the serpent rogue.

37
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:28,620
Yeah, you make potions. Actually, my cam might be in a good, I gotta move the cam.

38
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,800
You make potions and you go out and fight stuff.

39
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,720
Any NPC I believe can be killed, which is kind of scary.

40
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,139
I have played it a little bit to decide if I was like, yeah, that sounds like something I could do.

41
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,980
Let's go. We're going to two headphones and it's fucking scary. I hope you're ready.

42
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,419
Now you got a health bar up there. You got a stamina bar up there.

43
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,230
Solomon, the first steps are always the hardest.

44
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,870
Don't worry. You'll soon grow accustomed to your body.

45
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:07,909
You've quite a task ahead. It won't be easy, but I'll make sure to teach you all the right lessons.

46
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,200
For instance,

47
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,600
that'll be your transport out of this in-between. We'll meet again warden in a more stable place.

48
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:20,519
It's pretty. Lights off. Lights off. You got it.

49
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:38,009
You got it. Lights going off. Let me fix the cam.

50
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:54,139
Oh, that's better. All right, let's go. And by the way,

51
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,259
I'd run if I were you. The corruption is coming.

52
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:15,590
Actually, probably should run. Running takes stamina. Can you hear it? All right. Sounds good to me.

53
00:10:23,429 --> 00:10:28,379
Is this Elden Ring? No, this is okay. Hold on. Can you die in the tutorial?

54
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,950
Go, go, go, go. All right. I'm good. No, this is not it. This is

55
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:48,700
there's no like dodge roll. I don't think I'm pogging so hard already.

56
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,090
You should. You actually should be.

57
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,019
I believe this is on everything by the way.

58
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,539
This is not just on steam. It's on. I think it's on everything. It's on like switch.

59
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:07,059
Wherever you want to get it. It's such a long journey. There it is. Source of corruption.

60
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:16,149
It's blight spreads like wildfire. Given time, it'll consume everything. This cannot stand. There is much to be done.

61
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:23,029
New quest. The corrupted land. Investigate locations.

62
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:33,399
Okay, I was trying to fuck around and just walk off the edge, but I just found a secret.

63
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,639
Okay.

64
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:36,759
Sure.

65
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:38,360
What the hell is in here?

66
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,220
All right, we got apples, raw meat, tea leaves.

67
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:48,169
Ingredients can be used to craft powerful potions with unique effects. From raising the hollow

68
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:50,809
to transforming yourself into another species.

69
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:58,679
But before you can use such ingredients, first you need to study their structure in a research laboratory. Got it. Anything else in here?

70
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,200
You can pick up stuff, right?

71
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,019
There's aloe. Check your inventory. Press Y.

72
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:16,779
Everything has weight too.

73
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:18,860
Yeah, you have to like, okay, you have to research shit

74
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:27,779
before you can make potions.

75
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:32,259
There is fighting and yeah, it is like dangerous. You can die and there's consequences for dying.

76
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,600
What is this? Discover.

77
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,960
Poor creature. The corruption truly spares no one. Corrupted dog.

78
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:51,779
Go through the fog. Fog dork. This is pretty, this is not, why would this be pre-recorded? What are you talking about?

79
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,220
When did we get to get to the swearing segment?

80
00:12:55,379 --> 00:13:09,980
All right, so this is like the town. All right, so here's the brewing table.

81
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:16,090
Care to brew that special potion before you can use an ingredient? You must research it in the research laboratory first.

82
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,860
You should research it. Jim, is this a scary game?

83
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:28,120
No, I don't think so. I collect knowledge about brewing and experiment with bases of ingredients to discover the true power of alchemy.

84
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:33,639
Be aware that crafting potions without knowing the recipe can result in the ingredients being wasted. Don't fuck around here.

85
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:38,519
I don't know anything about these, so it would probably be stupid if I did it.

86
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:48,779
All right, you you got to research it before you can use it. I'm, I can swear that's fine, right? Can I?

87
00:13:54,379 --> 00:14:00,809
Should I not be?

88
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:06,019
Okay, so research. You have to research ingredients before you can use them.

89
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:15,379
Repeat after me, please. You got to study a few samples first. You can track the progress in your journal. Very cool.

90
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,460
All right, so I need, I got tea leaves.

91
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:20,809
I need, okay, I need more.

92
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:25,000
All right, so that is vitality.

93
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,240
There's like little hidden chests and shit around the world. It's pretty cool.

94
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:31,539
This looks like a warden's chest special container built specifically for your kind.

95
00:14:32,259 --> 00:14:38,179
Warden chests are connected in such a way that items stored in one location can be taken from another. Like a, like a diablo 2 chest, right?

96
00:14:39,429 --> 00:14:42,200
Anybody can use it?

97
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,179
I'm not swearing.

98
00:14:46,179 --> 00:14:48,580
All right, there's already stuff in here.

99
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,340
Healing potion.

100
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,789
Yeah, take it.

101
00:14:52,789 --> 00:14:59,860
Damage, I think you can use potions on anybody, I think. Maybe I shouldn't take all this.

102
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,759
That was a portable lab recipe.

103
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,679
Chicken form?

104
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:07,639
Transforms the user into another creature with all their strengths and weaknesses.

105
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,720
Yeah, whatever, I'll take it.

106
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,059
Let's take a few of these too. All right.

107
00:15:13,059 --> 00:15:15,220
Oh, yeah, you can cook. I forgot you can cook.

108
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,419
Yeah, you can use a cooking plate such as this to enhance the properties of your dishes.

109
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,659
Each cooking attempt requires one piece of log, which would be converted into charcoal.

110
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,919
Jesse.

111
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:30,120
Be aware that cooking without knowing the right recipe can result in ingredients being wasted.

112
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,919
So if you don't know anything, then there's no point. So I'm gonna hold, do I know any recipes?

113
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:40,649
That worked.

114
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:42,409
I have a choice steak.

115
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:44,840
All right. Well, I don't want to fuck around.

116
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:52,139
Do I know how to make any potions? Vitality and unexplored. Wait.

117
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,220
Do I have to research that?

118
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,149
Okay, I have to research that 20 times. Charcoal.

119
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:05,620
Okay. Yeah, there's a punch.

120
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:11,639
Two damage, that's not a dummy. Okay, cool.

121
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:15,529
There's a punch. This game is very pretty. It is very pretty.

122
00:16:16,169 --> 00:16:20,460
It actually looks very nice. All right, here we go.

123
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,659
And the wardens meet.

124
00:16:22,299 --> 00:16:24,460
Away from the darkness but under his shadow.

125
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,720
The wardens are sworn to serve the cycle and protect balance.

126
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,679
And yet, this is a dangerous place even for our kind.

127
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,919
Anyways, why don't you try and explore this area for materials and equipment?

128
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,799
It's worth training your offensive skills with the dummy as well.

129
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:43,190
This is no peaceful realm, not anymore.

130
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,230
Stop reading my messages.

131
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:49,179
Yeah, I mean, it gives you a little bit of like what to do.

132
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:52,039
But you kind of just do whatever you want, I guess.

133
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:55,320
This seems pretty open. Wait, what is this?

134
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:03,159
Chop. I can't chop that. What about this?

135
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:07,029
This is like a big map.

136
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:11,750
So I eventually have to go here. We'll get it.

137
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,299
Plague doctor? Yeah, there's a plague doctor.

138
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:18,140
The kiosk lost souls are drawn to it like moths to a flame.

139
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:21,019
So much left undone, it's hard coming to terms with it.

140
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:24,119
They don't know what to do so they leave requests.

141
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:27,319
You wouldn't understand wanting is unique to those who lived.

142
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,460
That's why we can help and that's why we can earn rewards.

143
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,990
Their dear gold, their precious hope.

144
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,150
How much is the game?

145
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:37,660
Well, it's available right now and it is currently.

146
00:17:40,099 --> 00:17:42,099
It is available on Steam right now.

147
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:45,509
I think it has a 10% off sale at the moment.

148
00:17:45,509 --> 00:17:49,910
Let's take a look.

149
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:56,470
The game is currently $17.99. It's part of a bundle too.

150
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:01,769
$17 bucks? $17.99? Not 19, no. $17.99.

151
00:18:01,769 --> 00:18:08,569
Let's go. That's less than a Hulk Hogan grill.

152
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,240
That's way less than a Hulk Hogan grill.

153
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,319
All right, so what is this?

154
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:23,500
This order is stained with blood so I must be in dire need of a healing potion.

155
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,700
So I need healing potion.

156
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,269
Don't have those on my chest? Oh, shit.

157
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:34,420
Okay. I didn't even make that though.

158
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:37,819
Five gold. That easy.

159
00:18:37,819 --> 00:18:39,400
That's easy. Simple.

160
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:45,160
Now what? Corruption is a way of changing things.

161
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,380
Often for worse, but sometimes for the better.

162
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:52,259
All right. I need to collect fucking berries and stuff.

163
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:55,019
Come on. I got berries, berries, berries, berries.

164
00:18:55,019 --> 00:18:57,589
Anything else on here? Was that a pumpkin?

165
00:18:57,589 --> 00:19:02,009
Just take everything. Fascinating little box, isn't it?

166
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:03,900
They used to not only research new ingredients,

167
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,140
but also to create powerful potions on the go.

168
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,099
This one's mine, but you can take it.

169
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:15,180
No worries, warden. I'll make another one for myself later on.

170
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:20,019
Fresh berries. Give it a try to use it to research a new few ingredients.

171
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,460
Okay. So you can, if you're out and about,

172
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,660
you don't have to come all the way back here.

173
00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:31,019
Research, pick up, or craft. All right. Research.

174
00:19:32,569 --> 00:19:34,329
I got three berries, so now I know what this does.

175
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:42,650
This is add. Add. Should I pick it up?

176
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:48,700
What about this other stuff here? Tea leaves?

177
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:52,980
Yeah. This game's all about, you got to make potions.

178
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:58,470
They're like the most important thing in the entire game.

179
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:02,220
I think if you die, you need to go get your stuff too.

180
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:06,460
The game does not, it's not like, oh, I died. I'm fine.

181
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,700
No, you got to go pick up all your shit or you're in trouble.

182
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:17,049
All right. What do tea leaves do? Do I research it?

183
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,009
Yeah. All your stuff. This seems pretty well-made so far.

184
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,609
Yeah. I told you guys. I was very clear.

185
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:35,400
Yeah, this is a sponsored stream, but this game looks really fun.

186
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,500
I was interested from the get-go.

187
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:46,730
This hats. How do I get new hats?

188
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:49,609
Ooh. Remove corruption from 12 creatures.

189
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:52,660
Catch 25 fish in water banks. This fishing.

190
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,259
Buy five items from the merchant.

191
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:58,470
Discover 15 creatures in the journal. That's cool.

192
00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:03,529
I only have the regular hat. All right. So let's go.

193
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:05,930
Let's go. Should I cook some food? I already have food, right?

194
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:12,500
Anything else I didn't see? What was this?

195
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:17,210
Can I do this? I think I, okay. Well, that didn't work.

196
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:21,140
Use left bumper to block and it's right trigger to attack.

197
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:26,579
And then right bumper is sort of an ingredients list. Cool.

198
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:29,140
This is the, all right. Why is inventory?

199
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:34,089
Oh, I can put, all right, hold on. Equip.

200
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:39,289
Ah, all right. Okay. Right bumper.

201
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:44,420
All right. So if I drink a damage potion, what happens?

202
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:50,440
It fucking hurts. You can, okay. I can throw it though.

203
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:58,410
What are we doing this? Is it in five damage?

204
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:03,990
Well, drink this. Did I just waste a bunch of ingredients?

205
00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:09,880
Okay. All right. What about the fish over here?

206
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,039
You need to finish the rest of the stream in the Elmo voice.

207
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,529
No, dude. Are you serious? No.

208
00:22:19,099 --> 00:22:21,829
Ooh, fish. I need a fishing rod.

209
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:31,430
All right. I got materials. I need a shovel to dig.

210
00:22:32,069 --> 00:22:37,190
What's this? What's this?

211
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,230
You know, were it up to me, you would never have come to this place to face something so dangerous.

212
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:47,369
To face something so dangerous, but allow me to offer some guidance.

213
00:22:47,369 --> 00:22:50,009
If nothing else, you'll need to cross the wasteland at some point.

214
00:22:51,019 --> 00:22:53,740
There's an ancient tree with roots that spread far and wide

215
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,299
and that tree, it burns with a ruinous flame.

216
00:22:57,529 --> 00:23:01,289
The corruption, of course, and it won't let you through, not without a fight anyway.

217
00:23:07,029 --> 00:23:09,369
Good luck. Hope we'll meet again before the end.

218
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:21,609
The dev said do Elmo. Is that a lie? Are you making that up?

219
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:23,210
To fast travel to another location, select the menu.

220
00:23:25,109 --> 00:23:30,500
All right. So now what? That was just like a little tutorial design.

221
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,859
All right. So I'm just going. I'm just going somewhere.

222
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:43,240
Stranger. The well is whispering. Can you hear it?

223
00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:48,950
It does. It does. The bustling murmurs of creation rising fiercely into this realm.

224
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,910
Don't believe me? He pressed your ears.

225
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:58,539
Sorry. Throw a coin, make a wish, and you'll have a glistening remedy against corruption.

226
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:06,650
Drop coins. Its words warm you from within.

227
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:13,240
Hey, I don't want to. How much money do I have?

228
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:19,099
I have eight dollars. Why would I do this? I have eight bucks. What a waste.

229
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:23,460
I don't want to do that. What's going on over here?

230
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:29,660
This is the pantry, a great place to store food.

231
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:37,319
We managed to find human followers. They can feed themselves here.

232
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,980
Feed followers? Should I cook an apple?

233
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:50,339
Hey, bro, a roasted apple. Calm down.

234
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:57,259
What about apple? What about an apple braised turkey leg?

235
00:24:57,819 --> 00:25:01,380
No. Actually, should I just bake these?

236
00:25:02,099 --> 00:25:07,579
Oh, I don't need wood. OK. I got a baked apple now.

237
00:25:07,579 --> 00:25:14,869
Who's this? There was someone waiting for me far and away on the other side of the other side.

238
00:25:15,509 --> 00:25:19,029
But now the farewell pier is hidden, covered by the looming vines, the killer plants,

239
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:26,019
the breaker vines. They endure safely from the no more fire for a much needed cleansing.

240
00:25:27,509 --> 00:25:29,269
Those tall plants, looming vines, he called them.

241
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:31,509
Perhaps there is some information to be gained about it nearby.

242
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,920
Well, that was a bomb. OK. Sorry about that.

243
00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:45,849
OK, so how do I get through this? OK. Well, don't touch it.

244
00:25:45,849 --> 00:25:49,299
This is really cute. It is. Yeah, this is really cool.

245
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:58,299
I need to be like picking stuff up. This game is all about preparation

246
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,019
because everything is dangerous, I think, out there.

247
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,420
So I don't just want to walk out like a dickhead and not have any tools.

248
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:10,940
So let me figure that out first. How do I make a shovel?

249
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:18,759
Wait, didn't I get a... I did. Portable lab recipe.

250
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:23,980
Oh, all right. I can make that now. What about over here?

251
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:36,170
Cheese, crusty bread, sunny side up egg. Ooh. Do I sleep?

252
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:48,150
I'm going to sleep. Sleep. Oh, I'm holding the button down.

253
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:52,619
What is this food meter going down for? Oh, shit. OK.

254
00:26:56,329 --> 00:27:04,660
Eat an apple. Oh, yep, yep. You have to eat for the stamina bar, right?

255
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:11,059
OK, cool, cool, cool, cool. Oh, yeah. More crates.

256
00:27:11,059 --> 00:27:16,579
What's going on over there? I have so much food.

257
00:27:17,579 --> 00:27:21,849
You hear threatening growling and barking nearby.

258
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:31,660
Those hounds seem to have gone feral and they're fighting each other.

259
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:40,839
What? Discover. Those hounds were actually fighting over scraps,

260
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:45,220
but this one looks too weak to defend itself. Maybe if it was fed.

261
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:49,539
If you want to tame a creature, first, you need to research what they eat

262
00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:51,460
so you can feed them and earn their trust.

263
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,869
All research results will be displayed in your journal.

264
00:27:54,869 --> 00:27:58,069
The more creatures of the same species you find, the more information about them you'll learn.

265
00:27:59,269 --> 00:28:04,539
All right. Wild dog. To learn more about a creature, select the menu

266
00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:11,029
and then choose the journal. The journal. Oh, dog.

267
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,640
Favorite food. Raw meat, choice steak, or baked meat pie.

268
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:22,519
I have steak. I just made it. Where is it?

269
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:26,069
All right. Choice steak. How do I use it?

270
00:28:26,069 --> 00:28:33,099
The pound is much better now and seems to have taken a liking to you.

271
00:28:33,099 --> 00:28:38,019
Perhaps if you fed other animals, they might have a similar reaction.

272
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:46,660
Really? Okay. Should I keep feeding them?

273
00:28:46,660 --> 00:29:00,599
What's up here? Wasteland.

274
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:07,430
Just like the old warden said, which means that must be the corrupted tree.

275
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:17,240
Hope my Friday's going well. Hope your Friday's going well, too.

276
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:22,549
He's starving. I'll feed him. I'm going to take care of him.

277
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:34,569
What's going on? There must be some way to heal that maelstrom and clear the passage.

278
00:29:34,569 --> 00:29:39,980
I have to heal it? All right.

279
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:48,539
Reach the corrupted tree. Did I prepare? Do I have any food?

280
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:51,099
All right. I have aloe. I have crusty.

281
00:29:51,099 --> 00:29:57,000
All right. I need to equip the crusty bread. Can I use this as a weapon?

282
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,609
Okay. I can use the bread as a weapon. This is some stale ass bread.

283
00:30:01,609 --> 00:30:09,910
Will it actually work? What's this? Oh, turnips.

284
00:30:11,029 --> 00:30:16,359
A mandragore. What the fuck?

285
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:23,500
What's going on? Hey, how do I pick this up?

286
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:29,799
Oh, I got it. A mandragore obtained.

287
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,059
The chest up here. Ow.

288
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:37,240
Do I have to get hurt by this? All right. I think I have to take the damage.

289
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,720
Was it worth it? I need a pick lock for this.

290
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:46,890
What's wrong with me? What's wrong with me?

291
00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:55,349
All right. Another mandragore. Okay.

292
00:30:55,349 --> 00:31:00,119
Oh, I need wood. I can chop the trees down. I need an axe.

293
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:07,990
What's wrong with me? I'm going to die. What's going on?

294
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:17,460
Oh, I'm taking tick damage. I can't die in the first...

295
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:25,589
I'm dead. Okay.

296
00:31:25,589 --> 00:31:32,440
We just had to see what happened when you died. We had to see what happened.

297
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,319
After perishing, you'll be returned to a safe location like the house.

298
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:37,720
Your belongings, however, will not.

299
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:41,880
Your items will remain in the same spot where you fell, just waiting for you to pick them up.

300
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,579
If you fall again, they'll be gone forever.

301
00:31:46,859 --> 00:31:49,339
Okay. Well, I had a lot of stuff, I think. I got to go get it right now.

302
00:31:56,809 --> 00:32:00,730
Where's my stamina bar? Shit.

303
00:32:01,769 --> 00:32:10,309
Okay. I have no... I don't have a stamina bar.

304
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:15,980
All right. Where's my stuff? Okay. Over here.

305
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:20,069
Okay. I got to go. Where was it? What's this 20% thing at the top?

306
00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:27,160
I was over here. I cleared that.

307
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:36,250
I went over this way. There it is. Okay.

308
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:39,210
Bag. Take it all. Oh, thank God.

309
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:49,559
What is that? What is that? A corrupted chicken?

310
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:58,869
What am I supposed to do? What is following me?

311
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:02,599
Portable lab has been stolen. What?

312
00:33:05,779 --> 00:33:09,380
Get out of here. Leave me alone. I don't have a stamina bar.

313
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:15,240
What the fuck? He stole my lab.

314
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:22,579
Okay. A wild rat. Oh, I'm learning about them.

315
00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:31,210
Can I... Like, what do I do about this?

316
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,880
All right. I need to eat something. Just eat all this cheese.

317
00:33:38,069 --> 00:33:41,910
Only two? All right. Somebody set up egg.

318
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,640
What is this thing counting? What's the 33%? 33%.

319
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:55,880
What's that mean? Ooh. Oh, I got a torch.

320
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:06,059
Oh, hell yeah. It's a weapon. On attack, remove three target vitalities.

321
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:08,280
This is a weapon. All right. Finally.

322
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:11,559
Can I light it? I need to get the lab back.

323
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:26,500
How do I get the lab back? He doesn't have anything on his inventory.

324
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,179
Horus undiscovered. Who's Horus?

325
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,880
Should I discover Horus? Why am I fighting this thing?

326
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:48,949
This shit has durability. Ow, you piece of shit.

327
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,860
All right. Did you have anything?

328
00:34:55,739 --> 00:35:01,909
I'm fucking dead. No shit. Don't die from thorns again, please.

329
00:35:02,469 --> 00:35:06,949
There's a chest in here. Did I get the lab back?

330
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:14,090
What is this? Open.

331
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:16,900
This chest is sealed with a strange lock and there's an inscription beside it.

332
00:35:18,949 --> 00:35:23,030
My prize is under protection three, which only the one that glows shall see.

333
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,099
This is a, I can light this. Can I?

334
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:39,769
Does this work? Oh, all right. Cool.

335
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:45,219
How long does it last? I don't want to die.

336
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:49,719
Moonstone and three textiles. I got to research this.

337
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:56,179
It looks like it comes back. I need my research lab.

338
00:35:56,179 --> 00:36:00,139
Did they actually get rid of it? Yeah, it stole it.

339
00:36:00,139 --> 00:36:02,619
I can't. That piece of shit actually stole it.

340
00:36:03,179 --> 00:36:16,199
The rat went south with the lab. I don't want to miss anything.

341
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:22,440
So it does seem pretty open. I was curious at like how open

342
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:24,199
this stuff was actually going to be.

343
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:30,070
There it is. He stole something else.

344
00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:36,710
Get over here. It's this thing. All right.

345
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,150
I got my shit back. I got my shit back.

346
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:50,179
Give me this lab textiles. Discover wild rat and oh, my crusty bread.

347
00:36:50,739 --> 00:36:58,570
Where's my weapon? I think it's 60% whatever that is.

348
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:01,960
Oh, you can heal by sitting down. That's actually really helpful.

349
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:05,500
All right. Let me, let me open up the lab.

350
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:11,400
Let's get that lab open portable lab.

351
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:18,059
Okay. So I need to research charcoal.

352
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:22,730
I need 19 more. Four more feathers and I know what it is.

353
00:37:23,369 --> 00:37:26,730
Three more mandragores. I have enough tea leaves.

354
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:28,659
What is it? Remove.

355
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:38,039
So when you go to the crafting table, you do like add something vitality

356
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:41,159
or like remove something vital, right? I think that's how it works.

357
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:46,889
Do I have any more? Yeah, like add vitality.

358
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:51,219
Would that do anything? Sloppy potion.

359
00:37:51,219 --> 00:37:53,219
No. All right. That didn't work.

360
00:37:53,219 --> 00:37:59,239
Because you have this four slots. Remove vitality.

361
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:01,639
You can probably make like hurt potions, right? All right. That's cool.

362
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:07,110
I'll pick it up. Should I burn these?

363
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:13,300
Is my torch dead? Shit, it is.

364
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:16,579
Okay. I don't have a torch.

365
00:38:16,579 --> 00:38:18,900
I'm back to using like the chicken leg as a weapon.

366
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,719
What's my favorite part of the game so far?

367
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:25,829
I don't know. I think I needed some more time in it.

368
00:38:25,829 --> 00:38:30,500
I don't have a pick lock, but all right.

369
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:34,889
It seems like you kind of just walk around and collect stuff

370
00:38:34,889 --> 00:38:37,369
and then make new stuff and then keep going and then get further

371
00:38:37,369 --> 00:38:39,530
into the game and then make new stuff and then collect more things.

372
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:45,019
It seems cool. All right.

373
00:38:45,019 --> 00:38:48,099
I have plenty of... All right. What's going on here?

374
00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:51,849
Is this a wild dog? Oh, all right.

375
00:38:51,849 --> 00:38:55,849
I know more. You have a moonstone?

376
00:38:55,849 --> 00:39:04,119
Well, this is what you have on you. Moonstone. Ingredient. Shining.

377
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:05,940
A special keystone. Bound to the edge.

378
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:11,510
Should I try to give this dog a snack? Oh, shit.

379
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:15,130
What about... No, no, no. Don't go. Don't go.

380
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:17,690
They like meat, right? Come here. Feed.

381
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:27,099
What's wrong? You don't want that. You don't? Dog.

382
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:31,500
Favorite food. Raw meat. Not raw meat.

383
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:39,420
Doesn't like raw meat. I thought I said raw meat.

384
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:42,070
Maybe this one doesn't... Maybe this one wants cooked meat.

385
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:44,659
Needs a steak. What about... Do you like bread?

386
00:39:46,949 --> 00:39:54,380
No. I don't want to kill it. I need to cook that steak.

387
00:39:54,380 --> 00:40:03,460
He's full. All right. I'm going to... I'm just going to eat this.

388
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:15,349
That's cool. Anything in here? I need a axe.

389
00:40:15,349 --> 00:40:20,170
Wait, I think that means... That thing's freaking me out.

390
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:23,050
Ninety one percent. Ninety two percent.

391
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:29,219
Sealed message. What happens at a hundred percent?

392
00:40:34,469 --> 00:40:36,539
Wait, material. Fuck.

393
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:45,900
Oh, world tomb and inspect in there. Oh, a worm. Another worm.

394
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:51,639
Okay. All right. Worms. I needed those to fish.

395
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:54,360
This is at 96. What's going on? What happens in the hundred percent?

396
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:07,559
What's going on? Ninety nine percent.

397
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:16,099
A corruption storm is wiping out the area.

398
00:41:17,369 --> 00:41:20,730
We'll give... Run! Get out of here! Wait, what?

399
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:24,570
What happened? Travel, travel, travel. Fast travel, right?

400
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,460
I can't fast travel during a storm. How do I get out of here?

401
00:41:31,099 --> 00:41:36,840
How do I get out of here? Where's the exit?

402
00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:50,179
Shit. Is that there forever?

403
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:59,690
What the hell is that? Does it say what it does?

404
00:42:01,289 --> 00:42:05,210
Does it give you like a time limit to make it so it's a little more stressful?

405
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:14,460
What the... This is a chicken corpse? What are you looking at?

406
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:17,030
Clement. Clement has an axe.

407
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:23,400
Wait, is there a... Who is this person?

408
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:32,380
Clement and this bird are friends. I want that axe.

409
00:42:33,099 --> 00:42:35,980
Is there like a... Can I steal?

410
00:42:36,619 --> 00:42:41,210
There's got to be like a steal, right? What are you doing?

411
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:50,679
Can I steal it? Don't steal.

412
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:54,679
I definitely can steal. All right. Well, fine.

413
00:42:54,679 --> 00:42:56,679
Are they friends or something? Why are they here?

414
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,250
All right. I need to... I need an axe.

415
00:43:04,059 --> 00:43:11,860
I need a weapon. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

416
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:17,050
Oh, okay. Enhance the axe.

417
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:23,579
Oh, all right. I can enhance the axe or I can forge.

418
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:25,340
All right. Here we go.

419
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,739
Make or enhance basic instruments with crafting materials.

420
00:43:27,739 --> 00:43:32,039
Each crafting attempt requires charcoal or a spectral fuel.

421
00:43:32,969 --> 00:43:34,570
You might need... You need to know the recipe.

422
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:37,369
All right. Well, I can't... Let me... Hold on. What's this?

423
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:40,389
Eight charcoal. Holy shit.

424
00:43:42,969 --> 00:43:49,719
There was something like a chop down over here, right? Like right here.

425
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,880
There was a couple of things I could chop down, right?

426
00:43:52,679 --> 00:44:01,099
I have no stamina. Logs and cut this.

427
00:44:02,059 --> 00:44:07,590
I need glass. Okay. Shit.

428
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:13,929
I love how good he is at acting like he doesn't know what he's doing.

429
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,179
I don't. I don't know what I'm doing.

430
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:26,440
I played like 15 minutes of the demo.

431
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,079
I walked around this town and was like, yeah, I think this is going to be fun.

432
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,500
Yeah, I didn't play the demo for four hours.

433
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,260
I played the demo for like five to 10 minutes.

434
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:37,590
I didn't play the demo for like four hours.

435
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:40,900
Oh, what's the axe do?

436
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,059
I'm not sure. I don't know. What's the axe do?

437
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:54,550
Somebody... I'm fine. I'm doing fine.

438
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:00,070
Okay. There was something else I needed to cut.

439
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:03,690
I remember seeing it. I think it was the trees, right?

440
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:10,869
Do you keep your money? You do.

441
00:45:16,809 --> 00:45:18,170
All right. Now that I actually have a weapon,

442
00:45:19,539 --> 00:45:24,260
I'm going to go back out and I'm going to be fine.

443
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,340
What's the game? The game is called The Serpent Rogue.

444
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:33,960
It's available for PlayStation 5, Xbox, X, Switch, Steam.

445
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:38,280
It's pretty much on everything. Are we friends?

446
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,420
Not yet. He's hungry.

447
00:45:43,059 --> 00:45:44,179
I got to get my food and come back.

448
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:49,579
Now it's on. It's on everything.

449
00:45:50,139 --> 00:45:52,739
All right. Well, this is where I did.

450
00:45:52,739 --> 00:45:54,019
Okay. 32. I get it.

451
00:45:54,019 --> 00:45:54,820
So I'm at 32%.

452
00:45:55,539 --> 00:45:56,900
I got to get out of here before that gets all the way up.

453
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:00,059
I get it. That's an interesting mechanic.

454
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:03,159
So you have a finite amount of time.

455
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:10,199
I need to eat something right now.

456
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:15,849
Baked apple and cheese, bread, eggs.

457
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:18,699
I need to cook this shit.

458
00:46:18,699 --> 00:46:20,059
I shouldn't just be eating it raw.

459
00:46:20,699 --> 00:46:25,960
Okay. There's a lot of logs.

460
00:46:26,599 --> 00:46:32,900
Okay. I don't want to break the axe.

461
00:46:33,909 --> 00:46:34,789
Does it really matter?

462
00:46:34,789 --> 00:46:35,829
All right. Wait, what's this up here?

463
00:46:41,449 --> 00:46:42,250
I have to clear this.

464
00:46:42,809 --> 00:46:49,239
A corrupted beast.

465
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:51,400
Fight it or cure it. The only way is through.

466
00:46:55,699 --> 00:47:00,090
Cure it with a sunny side up egg.

467
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:08,969
Do you think? All right.

468
00:47:08,969 --> 00:47:10,489
I don't think I want to fight this thing.

469
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:15,130
Should I discover it?

470
00:47:15,769 --> 00:47:16,940
Can I discover it?

471
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:18,420
Discover it.

472
00:47:19,059 --> 00:47:22,179
Oh, fuck. Okay. Do not.

473
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:29,460
Oh, chicken. No.

474
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:32,260
I probably shouldn't have done that either.

475
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:33,619
I probably shouldn't have done that either.

476
00:47:34,579 --> 00:47:35,539
All right. Get out of here.

477
00:47:36,099 --> 00:47:41,849
So many horrors.

478
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:44,710
I can heal them.

479
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:45,110
What's this?

480
00:47:49,739 --> 00:47:50,860
Diagro. Get away from me.

481
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:52,460
Oh, my God.

482
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:53,260
There's gold over there.

483
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:58,760
There's gold right here.

484
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,199
How do I get this gold?

485
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,300
Oh, my fucking God.

486
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:03,099
There's golden eggs here.

487
00:48:08,019 --> 00:48:08,980
Get away from me.

488
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:12,550
Use. I just used aloe on that dog.

489
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:19,929
Such a heavy burden.

490
00:48:19,929 --> 00:48:20,809
You're carrying too much weight,

491
00:48:20,809 --> 00:48:23,210
resulting in slow movement and inability to fast travel.

492
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:33,940
All right. I got to go get all that stuff.

493
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:35,460
Okay. I got to go grab some potions.

494
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,139
Fuck.

495
00:48:37,139 --> 00:48:41,139
When back to our world, are you strange?

496
00:48:41,139 --> 00:48:42,739
Usually takes you a bit longer to return.

497
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,460
Of course, I know about you.

498
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:46,420
I'm the Undertaker.

499
00:48:47,619 --> 00:48:49,139
I tend to the lost and the fallen.

500
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:51,780
Well, except you.

501
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:54,179
You're more of a fond and a risen.

502
00:48:54,739 --> 00:48:55,860
Never seen nothing like it.

503
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,869
But I know metal, like they say,

504
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:00,070
let bygones be bygones.

505
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:02,070
So bye and gone now.

506
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:07,000
You don't want no ghouls.

507
00:49:07,719 --> 00:49:10,280
The Undertaker can perform different actions

508
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,119
to help you with felled creatures.

509
00:49:12,679 --> 00:49:15,000
Clear location.

510
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Clear any location of hollow creatures.

511
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:21,179
The Undertaker will need only a shovel for this service.

512
00:49:23,059 --> 00:49:23,860
Or resurrect.

513
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,619
Bring back recently fallen allies

514
00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:26,900
in exchange for some gold coins.

515
00:49:29,769 --> 00:49:30,329
Interesting.

516
00:49:30,329 --> 00:49:31,449
You clear bodies?

517
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:35,349
Oh, that's kind of cool.

518
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:38,340
Okay. I need to go get my stuff and come back here

519
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:38,739
because I...

520
00:49:39,619 --> 00:49:40,340
Whoa. Where am I?

521
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:44,780
Oh, I'm over here.

522
00:49:49,699 --> 00:49:50,340
World tomb.

523
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:52,659
What does this get me?

524
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:55,739
Use information about this realm.

525
00:49:58,199 --> 00:49:59,400
I got Undertaker lore.

526
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,440
Oh, it's like little lore books.

527
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:00,940
I get it.

528
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,260
All right. Let me pick up some shit over here.

529
00:50:08,119 --> 00:50:09,639
Deal with the Val Raven.

530
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:15,500
All right. I can stop dying over and over again.

531
00:50:16,059 --> 00:50:19,429
I love the music.

532
00:50:19,429 --> 00:50:20,309
The music is really good.

533
00:50:20,949 --> 00:50:22,630
What about your house?

534
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,139
Cool.

535
00:50:26,139 --> 00:50:27,739
Something's inside.

536
00:50:27,739 --> 00:50:28,539
How can I open this?

537
00:50:29,099 --> 00:50:31,989
What's that?

538
00:50:31,989 --> 00:50:39,320
I need a lockpick.

539
00:50:40,039 --> 00:50:41,449
I don't have any food.

540
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:44,230
Yeah. I got to get some new recipes or something.

541
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:45,909
I got to stop dying out in that world.

542
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:49,369
How do I get that?

543
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:56,500
Oh, I have an idea.

544
00:50:57,059 --> 00:51:06,150
Will this work?

545
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:09,909
Can I like throw it into the chandelier?

546
00:51:09,909 --> 00:51:17,300
I don't think so.

547
00:51:18,019 --> 00:51:19,849
How do I knock that down?

548
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,800
Look, it's at least he's getting sponsored by a game

549
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:26,679
that actually looks pretty fun.

550
00:51:26,679 --> 00:51:27,559
So that is some bullshit.

551
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:28,360
That's what I'm saying.

552
00:51:29,079 --> 00:51:32,119
Yeah. This is I'm saying this is pretty fun.

553
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:33,960
I did my research.

554
00:51:34,519 --> 00:51:43,539
I'll go back to him.

555
00:51:43,539 --> 00:51:46,679
This is, yeah, this is sponsored.

556
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:55,960
Okay. I was overburdened, which is interesting.

557
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:00,309
Um, looks good.

558
00:52:00,309 --> 00:52:00,869
It does look, yeah.

559
00:52:00,869 --> 00:52:08,059
The game looks good.

560
00:52:08,059 --> 00:52:08,860
What can I make?

561
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,980
I just got to, I got to go get my shit.

562
00:52:12,619 --> 00:52:13,579
All right. Go, go, go, go, go.

563
00:52:13,579 --> 00:52:14,139
Go get your stuff.

564
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,460
I need raw, I mean, I need meat for the dog

565
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:21,139
because the dog needs like to eat one more.

566
00:52:21,699 --> 00:52:22,260
Are you okay?

567
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:25,340
The dog's really hungry.

568
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:26,539
All right. Dog is very hungry.

569
00:52:26,539 --> 00:52:32,389
What's this? Eggs?

570
00:52:32,389 --> 00:52:35,079
Ooh, egg, shell.

571
00:52:35,639 --> 00:52:37,769
What's in here?

572
00:52:37,769 --> 00:52:40,949
This looks like an animal feeder

573
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:42,949
could come in handy when nourishing tamed creatures.

574
00:52:42,949 --> 00:52:43,989
If you can get some in here.

575
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:52,199
Ah, is this game open world?

576
00:52:53,289 --> 00:52:55,690
I, yeah, this feels pretty open world to me.

577
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:02,969
Open world, crafting, dangerous, risky.

578
00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:04,969
You can lose all your stuff.

579
00:53:06,179 --> 00:53:07,139
It checks a lot.

580
00:53:07,139 --> 00:53:08,579
It's 87% right now.

581
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:10,260
I got to get my stuff and get out of here.

582
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:11,750
Where is it?

583
00:53:14,809 --> 00:53:16,730
Yeah, I got to bring this stuff back and research it.

584
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:17,369
Where's my stuff?

585
00:53:22,739 --> 00:53:23,619
Shit, I don't know.

586
00:53:23,619 --> 00:53:24,579
It's up here somewhere, right?

587
00:53:26,539 --> 00:53:28,300
He's lying down right next to it.

588
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:29,019
Come on.

589
00:53:29,019 --> 00:53:29,579
All right.

590
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:30,860
I have no stamina, but I can get it.

591
00:53:34,329 --> 00:53:35,530
Wait, I'm going to be overburdened.

592
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:42,659
These are supposed to be damaged potions.

593
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:44,340
I'm going to be overburdened.

594
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:48,789
All right.

595
00:53:48,789 --> 00:53:51,769
Just how do I drop stuff?

596
00:53:51,769 --> 00:53:52,250
How do I drop?

597
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:55,739
I'm dead.

598
00:53:57,219 --> 00:53:59,559
No, no, no, no, no.

599
00:53:59,559 --> 00:54:00,280
Just drop everything.

600
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:00,760
Oh my God.

601
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:01,239
I'm dead again.

602
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:02,199
This stuff is dead.

603
00:54:02,199 --> 00:54:02,840
This stuff is gone.

604
00:54:03,639 --> 00:54:05,079
This stuff is actually gone.

605
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,420
I couldn't run.

606
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:08,139
I was overburdened.

607
00:54:09,269 --> 00:54:09,829
Fuck.

608
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:10,550
All right.

609
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:12,070
It's surrounded by animals.

610
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:12,949
I can't.

611
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:13,269
Okay.

612
00:54:13,829 --> 00:54:15,420
What do I do about this?

613
00:54:18,809 --> 00:54:20,170
I think I just have to lose that.

614
00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:24,059
Will the undertaker help?

615
00:54:25,989 --> 00:54:26,309
Okay.

616
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:28,550
He's camping my gear.

617
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:32,070
That guy's camping my gear and it's not fair.

618
00:54:39,739 --> 00:54:40,780
He followed me around.

619
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:41,820
He camping me.

620
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:42,780
He's camping me.

621
00:54:47,429 --> 00:54:48,309
Okay.

622
00:54:48,309 --> 00:54:53,980
Should I wait?

623
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:56,280
Maybe I'll go to sleep.

624
00:55:02,789 --> 00:55:03,590
Oh, wait a minute.

625
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:04,550
I can do this.

626
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:09,900
Corruption Storm was wiping out this air.

627
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:10,219
Wait.

628
00:55:10,219 --> 00:55:11,420
This one that I'm in right now?

629
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:16,059
What?

630
00:55:16,619 --> 00:55:24,360
Okay.

631
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,400
Looming vines.

632
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,199
I'll read that later.

633
00:55:26,199 --> 00:55:26,440
Wait.

634
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,480
Would this actually come over here?

635
00:55:30,309 --> 00:55:31,429
I got so screwed.

636
00:55:31,429 --> 00:55:31,909
I died.

637
00:55:34,489 --> 00:55:34,969
Oh, okay.

638
00:55:34,969 --> 00:55:35,369
It's gone.

639
00:55:35,929 --> 00:55:37,690
Okay.

640
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:38,889
The plan is there.

641
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:41,369
I'm going to go pick up my stuff.

642
00:55:42,409 --> 00:55:42,730
No.

643
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:43,449
I have a better idea.

644
00:55:45,219 --> 00:55:45,780
I'm going to...

645
00:55:46,579 --> 00:55:47,139
Is there a sneak?

646
00:55:51,610 --> 00:55:53,369
That guy's lying down next to my backpack.

647
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:57,900
Any more food?

648
00:56:04,489 --> 00:56:05,130
He's lying.

649
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:05,449
Look at him.

650
00:56:05,449 --> 00:56:06,889
He's lying down next to my backpack.

651
00:56:09,579 --> 00:56:10,059
I can't...

652
00:56:10,059 --> 00:56:10,860
If I pick that up...

653
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:11,900
I was going to pick up the randoms.

654
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:12,300
I got to run.

655
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:13,699
Here we go.

656
00:56:13,699 --> 00:56:14,019
Ready?

657
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:21,269
All right.

658
00:56:21,269 --> 00:56:22,150
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

659
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:22,630
I'll drop it off.

660
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:23,110
I'll drop it off.

661
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:27,690
Just get him away from it.

662
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:34,809
Okay.

663
00:56:35,369 --> 00:56:41,929
Okay.

664
00:56:41,929 --> 00:56:43,769
Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.

665
00:56:43,769 --> 00:56:45,019
All right.

666
00:56:45,019 --> 00:56:46,300
Now I'm going to go turn this in.

667
00:56:52,039 --> 00:56:52,199
Okay.

668
00:56:52,199 --> 00:56:52,920
We're good.

669
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:56,869
No, I don't want to take all.

670
00:56:56,869 --> 00:56:58,469
If I take all, I'm going to be over encumbered

671
00:56:58,469 --> 00:57:00,070
and I'm going to be walking like two miles per hour

672
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:01,030
and he's going to kill me.

673
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:03,829
When a creature becomes restless,

674
00:57:03,829 --> 00:57:06,710
their base stats change and they gain strength

675
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:08,230
but also lose stamina.

676
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:10,570
Make sure to keep an eye on your followers

677
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:11,369
when they are in this state

678
00:57:11,369 --> 00:57:13,130
as they turn to ashes when felled.

679
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:13,849
What?

680
00:57:13,849 --> 00:57:18,219
What's wrong with me?

681
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:20,789
What happened to me?

682
00:57:20,789 --> 00:57:21,269
What happened?

683
00:57:21,269 --> 00:57:22,309
Why am I a skeleton?

684
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,039
I turned into a skeleton.

685
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:28,789
Okay.

686
00:57:28,789 --> 00:57:30,309
Let me go back here and deposit this.

687
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,639
I turned into a skeleton.

688
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:38,659
All right.

689
00:57:38,659 --> 00:57:39,860
Let me put this stuff away

690
00:57:42,219 --> 00:57:43,260
and then I'm going to dump this

691
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:44,139
and go get more of it.

692
00:57:44,699 --> 00:57:47,800
Zura, do I have a container here?

693
00:57:48,519 --> 00:57:51,849
You turn into a skeleton when you die?

694
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,179
I've died a couple of times.

695
00:57:55,179 --> 00:57:56,539
Maybe I'm dying too much.

696
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:57,260
What have I said down?

697
00:57:58,139 --> 00:57:59,820
The restless never tire.

698
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:02,139
Oh.

699
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:05,940
Oh, shit.

700
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:06,260
Okay.

701
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:08,500
Now, let me drop this up.

702
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:18,260
I can't.

703
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:19,860
I don't have any stamina anymore.

704
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:24,199
Is there no more requests?

705
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,420
Okay.

706
00:58:27,059 --> 00:58:28,090
Drop this to the house.

707
00:58:33,289 --> 00:58:33,769
Very cool.

708
00:58:33,769 --> 00:58:34,010
All right.

709
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:34,409
Research.

710
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:36,019
There we go.

711
00:58:36,019 --> 00:58:41,460
Charcoal, sulfur, shells.

712
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:43,820
Do I not?

713
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:45,579
I don't have a potion yet that I've learned.

714
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:47,800
Not yet.

715
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,690
All right.

716
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:51,130
Let's dump some of this stuff here.

717
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:54,150
Okay.

718
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:54,389
What?

719
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:56,469
How do I use this?

720
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:59,610
All right.

721
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:00,010
Switch it.

722
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:01,769
I want to put away like all these berries.

723
00:59:02,809 --> 00:59:07,460
I'm 25 out of 40.

724
00:59:08,179 --> 00:59:09,539
I'll keep the logs away.

725
00:59:09,539 --> 00:59:10,019
They're heavy.

726
00:59:10,579 --> 00:59:11,860
Scrap.

727
00:59:12,579 --> 00:59:13,619
Portable app I'll keep.

728
00:59:14,179 --> 00:59:16,389
I don't know if these damage potions really do anything.

729
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:17,909
All right.

730
00:59:17,909 --> 00:59:18,710
Now I'm more confident.

731
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:19,510
I'll go in there and get it.

732
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:24,789
Okay.

733
00:59:25,429 --> 00:59:26,309
I should have enough room now.

734
00:59:26,949 --> 00:59:33,460
So the food doesn't do anything either.

735
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:39,659
But the portable app.

736
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:54,980
I should be able to carry everything now.

737
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:56,099
Your guy ain't ripped.

738
00:59:56,099 --> 00:59:57,460
He'll die in two.

739
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:57,699
Yeah.

740
00:59:59,239 --> 01:00:00,599
I should be able to go pick up the rest of this.

741
01:00:00,599 --> 01:00:04,519
And then I need to pick up more stuff to examine.

742
01:00:04,519 --> 01:00:04,760
Right?

743
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:09,179
I didn't pick up my weapon, did I?

744
01:00:11,099 --> 01:00:12,139
No, but I'm going to carry these.

745
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:13,349
Okay.

746
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:16,860
Scary guys over there.

747
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:24,179
So these are they're just animals but they're like corrupted.

748
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:26,809
Please don't kill me.

749
01:00:31,639 --> 01:00:32,599
You can heal them.

750
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:35,210
I need to learn how to make like a healing potion.

751
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:37,159
Where's my stuff?

752
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:41,239
Don't kill me.

753
01:00:41,239 --> 01:00:47,780
Goodbye.

754
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:51,699
There's a chest right here.

755
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:53,449
All right.

756
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:54,329
Don't take too much shit.

757
01:00:54,329 --> 01:00:55,050
Don't take too much stuff.

758
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:55,769
I got to get out of here.

759
01:00:56,889 --> 01:00:58,460
All right.

760
01:00:58,460 --> 01:00:58,699
Get me out.

761
01:00:58,699 --> 01:00:59,179
Get me out.

762
01:00:59,179 --> 01:00:59,739
Fast travel.

763
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:02,219
Oh crap.

764
01:01:11,079 --> 01:01:11,480
All right.

765
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:11,880
I'm good.

766
01:01:14,119 --> 01:01:15,639
Now I actually can research.

767
01:01:15,639 --> 01:01:16,840
I'm getting out of here.

768
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,679
How do I heal this skeleton problem?

769
01:01:20,889 --> 01:01:22,090
How do I get rid of the skeleton?

770
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:22,889
I'm looking at my skeleton.

771
01:01:23,449 --> 01:01:26,869
All right.

772
01:01:26,869 --> 01:01:28,070
I can research more.

773
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:31,059
How do I get that?

774
01:01:31,699 --> 01:01:32,539
Oh wait.

775
01:01:34,119 --> 01:01:34,440
Really?

776
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,530
I can't just like shake it loose.

777
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:38,309
Crawl.

778
01:01:38,309 --> 01:01:39,269
Looks like a rat hole.

779
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:42,820
I need to cure myself.

780
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:44,679
I got to figure out.

781
01:01:44,679 --> 01:01:45,480
I got to find a cure.

782
01:01:47,659 --> 01:01:48,059
All right.

783
01:01:48,059 --> 01:01:48,380
Shell.

784
01:01:49,179 --> 01:01:53,960
I need one more shell to learn what it does.

785
01:01:54,599 --> 01:01:55,780
All right.

786
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:56,739
How am I doing on stuff?

787
01:01:57,460 --> 01:02:01,829
I got a lot of eggs.

788
01:02:02,389 --> 01:02:05,849
Portable lab.

789
01:02:05,849 --> 01:02:06,489
That's really heavy.

790
01:02:06,489 --> 01:02:07,130
I should get rid of it.

791
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:10,579
I didn't want to drink that potion

792
01:02:10,579 --> 01:02:12,500
and I'm going to fucking die if I do that again accidentally.

793
01:02:16,550 --> 01:02:16,789
See.

794
01:02:16,789 --> 01:02:16,949
Wait.

795
01:02:16,949 --> 01:02:17,349
What's this?

796
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:19,619
Oh yeah.

797
01:02:19,619 --> 01:02:20,099
I picked that up.

798
01:02:20,099 --> 01:02:20,579
What is it?

799
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:25,429
Sealed message.

800
01:02:25,429 --> 01:02:31,800
Can I open it?

801
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:32,840
Oh shit.

802
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,179
Hey this glass.

803
01:02:34,179 --> 01:02:34,980
I got glass.

804
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:35,780
Cooking recipe.

805
01:02:38,579 --> 01:02:39,059
Check this out.

806
01:02:39,619 --> 01:02:44,309
Did you see the banana bros?

807
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:48,699
I have glass, right?

808
01:02:49,739 --> 01:02:56,570
What's in there?

809
01:02:56,570 --> 01:02:56,969
Coin.

810
01:02:56,969 --> 01:02:57,769
Cooking recipe.

811
01:02:58,409 --> 01:02:58,969
What was that?

812
01:02:58,969 --> 01:02:59,369
Aging.

813
01:03:01,139 --> 01:03:01,940
Cooking recipe.

814
01:03:03,219 --> 01:03:04,260
Rustic apple tart.

815
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:06,900
Beef and eggs.

816
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:10,440
What else?

817
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:15,590
A maturing effect that increases the user's age.

818
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:23,769
So somebody can drink this?

819
01:03:23,769 --> 01:03:31,030
So I can...

820
01:03:32,230 --> 01:03:33,190
What if I drink this?

821
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:34,230
I'm a skeleton already.

822
01:03:34,869 --> 01:03:38,739
Did I get a new...

823
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:40,539
No.

824
01:03:40,539 --> 01:03:41,500
I got to pick up more stuff.

825
01:03:42,139 --> 01:03:42,619
Okay.

826
01:03:42,619 --> 01:03:43,739
Deposit everything.

827
01:03:43,739 --> 01:03:45,739
Should I just go die somewhere?

828
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:48,940
How do I heal?

829
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:51,860
Okay.

830
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:53,300
I'm going to put most of this stuff away.

831
01:03:54,099 --> 01:03:59,590
It's a lab away too.

832
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:00,070
I don't need it.

833
01:04:00,869 --> 01:04:01,670
Textiles.

834
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:02,070
Torch.

835
01:04:05,059 --> 01:04:05,219
Yeah.

836
01:04:05,219 --> 01:04:06,420
Let's go with the fresh tart there.

837
01:04:08,329 --> 01:04:09,369
Maybe I should keep a few of these.

838
01:04:09,369 --> 01:04:10,010
Can I eat this?

839
01:04:13,130 --> 01:04:13,929
I'll keep the torch.

840
01:04:14,570 --> 01:04:15,820
Oh.

841
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:16,619
I'm going to go get fish.

842
01:04:17,179 --> 01:04:18,949
That sounds like a good idea.

843
01:04:18,949 --> 01:04:24,170
Do you have a code so we can let the devs know

844
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:25,289
that we learned about the game from you?

845
01:04:27,579 --> 01:04:27,739
No.

846
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:28,300
I just get it.

847
01:04:29,179 --> 01:04:30,380
I don't have like a code or anything.

848
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:31,829
Okay.

849
01:04:31,829 --> 01:04:32,389
Catch fish.

850
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:36,860
Did it work?

851
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:37,739
Why are they skeletons?

852
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:41,500
Fish bone?

853
01:04:42,139 --> 01:04:42,550
No.

854
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:43,190
I want fish.

855
01:04:43,190 --> 01:04:43,750
Not fish.

856
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:44,469
Why are we all dead?

857
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:49,159
How many can I catch?

858
01:04:49,159 --> 01:04:52,539
Should I go to a different water?

859
01:04:56,659 --> 01:04:57,780
These fish bones are ancient

860
01:04:57,780 --> 01:04:58,900
but they could work as ingredients

861
01:04:58,900 --> 01:04:59,940
for advanced potions.

862
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:01,780
It's important to be careful not all things

863
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:05,289
that hide beneath the surface of treasure.

864
01:05:05,289 --> 01:05:05,929
Kind of ominous.

865
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:07,659
Ooh.

866
01:05:07,659 --> 01:05:08,300
Raw fishes.

867
01:05:13,989 --> 01:05:14,150
No.

868
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:14,469
Yeah.

869
01:05:14,469 --> 01:05:15,030
There's no code.

870
01:05:17,369 --> 01:05:17,610
All right.

871
01:05:17,610 --> 01:05:18,010
Research.

872
01:05:18,570 --> 01:05:21,239
Okay.

873
01:05:21,239 --> 01:05:22,920
I need four more fish bones

874
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:23,480
and I'll have...

875
01:05:24,119 --> 01:05:24,599
All right.

876
01:05:24,599 --> 01:05:25,639
I'm actually kind of into this.

877
01:05:27,929 --> 01:05:28,409
Four more.

878
01:05:28,889 --> 01:05:30,420
I think I have enough.

879
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:35,349
One.

880
01:05:35,349 --> 01:05:35,590
Two.

881
01:05:36,309 --> 01:05:39,780
The channel description is an affiliate link.

882
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:40,789
Yeah.

883
01:05:40,789 --> 01:05:41,030
Yeah.

884
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:41,829
That link should work.

885
01:05:42,389 --> 01:05:45,579
Yeah.

886
01:05:45,579 --> 01:05:47,099
I have a panel where if you click the panel

887
01:05:47,099 --> 01:05:48,219
it'll take you to the store page

888
01:05:49,449 --> 01:05:52,550
and on the tweet too.

889
01:05:52,550 --> 01:05:53,219
All right.

890
01:05:53,219 --> 01:05:58,710
That should be good.

891
01:05:58,710 --> 01:05:58,869
Yeah.

892
01:05:58,869 --> 01:06:01,190
It's for pretty much all the major consoles.

893
01:06:01,989 --> 01:06:02,789
Steam.

894
01:06:02,789 --> 01:06:03,510
$17.99.

895
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:03,829
I don't know.

896
01:06:03,829 --> 01:06:05,670
I think it's $17.99 on Steam.

897
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:08,679
I don't know if it's the same.

898
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:13,239
Wait a minute.

899
01:06:17,179 --> 01:06:17,420
Ten.

900
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:19,719
Wait.

901
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:21,139
Everybody hold on.

902
01:06:21,139 --> 01:06:22,099
I think I just figured it out.

903
01:06:28,409 --> 01:06:29,289
I think I just figured it out.

904
01:06:30,889 --> 01:06:31,130
Yeah.

905
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:31,690
I absolutely did.

906
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:32,090
Here we go.

907
01:06:32,730 --> 01:06:33,210
I got it.

908
01:06:33,210 --> 01:06:33,690
Check this out.

909
01:06:34,650 --> 01:06:34,969
Add.

910
01:06:36,010 --> 01:06:36,329
Ten.

911
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:37,929
Vitality.

912
01:06:39,059 --> 01:06:47,780
Right?

913
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:48,659
Make a shitload of them.

914
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:50,489
Okay.

915
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:52,099
Now.

916
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:54,739
What's wrong with me?

917
01:06:54,739 --> 01:06:55,300
All right.

918
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:56,099
Drink that.

919
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:01,639
Drink.

920
01:07:03,289 --> 01:07:03,690
Ugh.

921
01:07:04,409 --> 01:07:07,030
Why am I still old?

922
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:11,780
He's making potions in the bathroom.

923
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:17,139
I'm not leaving the house.

924
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:19,210
Oh, it's in the wasteland.

925
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:19,449
Okay.

926
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:24,980
I can't sleep.

927
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:31,269
Sorry.

928
01:07:31,269 --> 01:07:31,989
Wipe my lip again.

929
01:07:34,679 --> 01:07:36,039
Making potions in the toilet.

930
01:07:37,079 --> 01:07:38,300
I should cook some.

931
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:38,460
All right.

932
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:39,099
Let me cook.

933
01:07:39,099 --> 01:07:40,059
How many eggs can I?

934
01:07:40,059 --> 01:07:40,940
Can I just cooked egg?

935
01:07:42,219 --> 01:07:43,260
Oh, all right.

936
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:43,579
Let's do.

937
01:07:43,579 --> 01:07:44,300
Oh, wait.

938
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:44,940
I need to do this.

939
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:46,619
Beef and eggs.

940
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:50,949
Oh, okay.

941
01:07:50,949 --> 01:07:53,110
So this is one egg and one raw meat.

942
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:56,469
Get a beef and eggs and I'll make a shitload of sunny side up eggs.

943
01:07:57,269 --> 01:08:01,530
Okay.

944
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:05,179
So I got beef and eggs.

945
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:10,550
Go kick the vines.

946
01:08:11,030 --> 01:08:15,929
Yeah.

947
01:08:15,929 --> 01:08:18,010
I need to, I need to not wait.

948
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:19,529
I think I have some knowledge on it, right?

949
01:08:20,569 --> 01:08:22,970
What does this do?

950
01:08:36,409 --> 01:08:40,539
Oh, I think I'm very overburdened.

951
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:43,020
Can I hold the axe as a chicken?

952
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:44,729
All right.

953
01:08:44,729 --> 01:08:45,449
I need to get back.

954
01:08:45,449 --> 01:08:51,739
I need to get back in the house because I need to deposit some stuff.

955
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:55,619
Is there, I'm overburdened with the chicken.

956
01:08:56,260 --> 01:09:01,020
So you can turn into different animals.

957
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:07,029
Can I fly?

958
01:09:09,619 --> 01:09:13,100
Oh, okay.

959
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:13,579
I get it.

960
01:09:15,029 --> 01:09:15,270
All right.

961
01:09:15,270 --> 01:09:17,989
Now we're going back out there and I'm going to go collect some more stuff.

962
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:24,869
Okay.

963
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:26,630
I can't do any of that.

964
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:28,680
Anything that is not.

965
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:28,920
Okay.

966
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:30,920
I have, charcoal has been researched.

967
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,500
What does charcoal do for me now?

968
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:37,350
I think I just know about it.

969
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:40,260
Deposit some stuff.

970
01:09:40,819 --> 01:09:41,560
All right.

971
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:42,359
Put this away.

972
01:09:42,359 --> 01:09:43,079
Put this away.

973
01:09:44,729 --> 01:09:45,449
Put this away.

974
01:09:45,449 --> 01:09:47,850
Keep like five ass sunny side up eggs.

975
01:09:48,409 --> 01:09:50,699
I can probably cook the raw fish.

976
01:09:50,699 --> 01:09:51,659
Get rid of the logs.

977
01:09:51,659 --> 01:09:52,619
Beef and eggs keep it.

978
01:09:52,619 --> 01:09:53,500
Scrap, get rid of it.

979
01:09:54,859 --> 01:09:55,979
The potions, get rid of it.

980
01:09:56,789 --> 01:09:57,029
All right.

981
01:09:57,029 --> 01:10:01,699
I'm at 25 out of 40, which, oh, use that.

982
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:04,069
I learned about moonstone.

983
01:10:04,710 --> 01:10:06,470
And I have a torch.

984
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:06,710
All right.

985
01:10:06,710 --> 01:10:07,989
I'm ready to go back out there.

986
01:10:07,989 --> 01:10:11,989
I'm ready to check it out.

987
01:10:11,989 --> 01:10:22,779
What are your thoughts on the game so far?

988
01:10:24,329 --> 01:10:26,569
I think, I actually think it's really interesting.

989
01:10:26,569 --> 01:10:27,609
I'm really, it's actually fun.

990
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:33,510
Okay.

991
01:10:33,510 --> 01:10:35,350
When I like die over and over again in a game.

992
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:38,630
And I, I don't know, there's like animals and stuff.

993
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:38,869
I don't know.

994
01:10:38,869 --> 01:10:39,670
We'll see.

995
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:42,520
Can I do anything with you?

996
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:45,260
The wild dog is really hungry, but I don't know.

997
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:46,619
I, I cooked all the food.

998
01:10:48,069 --> 01:10:49,270
Let me go get some meat.

999
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:52,380
This time I'm not running straight.

1000
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:53,420
I'm running to the right.

1001
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:56,279
It's pretty, it's really relaxing.

1002
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:05,960
I'm very interested in kind of how elaborate it actually is.

1003
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:09,380
Cause there's like followers, there's pets.

1004
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:11,060
You can, what's this?

1005
01:11:14,890 --> 01:11:16,489
Chances coin can be found here.

1006
01:11:16,489 --> 01:11:20,840
Tomato, egg, apple can be found here.

1007
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:22,729
This is random.

1008
01:11:24,779 --> 01:11:26,779
So wait, there's a chance that that will be there now.

1009
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:31,000
I still will deal with this shit up here.

1010
01:11:31,899 --> 01:11:32,140
All right.

1011
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:33,180
We got some wild dogs.

1012
01:11:33,819 --> 01:11:37,510
Four out of 15.

1013
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:39,909
One of the 15 wild.

1014
01:11:39,909 --> 01:11:40,470
Are they different?

1015
01:11:41,189 --> 01:11:47,720
Investigate the corrupted tree.

1016
01:11:48,279 --> 01:11:50,069
Can I, is that thing there?

1017
01:11:50,789 --> 01:11:51,590
I think the thing's gone.

1018
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:58,279
Investigate it.

1019
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:05,289
How do I investigate it?

1020
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:11,859
I can, I can, hold on.

1021
01:12:12,579 --> 01:12:13,220
I have a question.

1022
01:12:13,939 --> 01:12:15,579
This is a healing potion.

1023
01:12:16,539 --> 01:12:20,060
Can I like throw it at this and will it heal this?

1024
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:22,760
Right?

1025
01:12:23,399 --> 01:12:28,090
Will this do anything?

1026
01:12:28,649 --> 01:12:30,600
I don't think so.

1027
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:32,420
All right.

1028
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:34,020
I gotta be careful that corruption thing's coming.

1029
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:35,380
Like I'm so, I gotta get some more materials.

1030
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:38,739
Go look in the hole.

1031
01:12:44,039 --> 01:12:44,840
Put vessel?

1032
01:12:45,479 --> 01:12:50,680
Corruption is specifically, especially powerful, but there's a spot here between the tree roots.

1033
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:53,960
Something could be placed to heal it from the inside.

1034
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:56,300
I need to put a vessel there.

1035
01:12:56,939 --> 01:12:58,649
Okay.

1036
01:12:59,210 --> 01:13:02,760
Interesting.

1037
01:13:03,319 --> 01:13:06,170
I'm going over here for a minute.

1038
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:12,229
There was a chest right here that I get it.

1039
01:13:12,229 --> 01:13:12,869
What's this stuff?

1040
01:13:13,510 --> 01:13:14,579
Fuck you.

1041
01:13:14,579 --> 01:13:16,340
That just scared the shit out of me now I'm poisoned.

1042
01:13:17,850 --> 01:13:18,250
Hold on.

1043
01:13:18,970 --> 01:13:24,329
There's nothing even in there.

1044
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:28,659
13 ticks of poison.

1045
01:13:28,659 --> 01:13:29,300
How much is it doing?

1046
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:29,539
One.

1047
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:33,300
What else was there?

1048
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:34,260
Something else over here, wasn't there?

1049
01:13:34,819 --> 01:13:40,020
What was that?

1050
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:42,439
Swamplich.

1051
01:13:44,199 --> 01:13:44,840
What do you like?

1052
01:13:45,399 --> 01:13:46,359
Do you like stuff?

1053
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:49,850
Can I have this as a pet?

1054
01:13:50,409 --> 01:13:53,979
That's kind of cool.

1055
01:13:54,539 --> 01:13:57,060
For now, I want more materials.

1056
01:13:57,060 --> 01:13:59,380
I feel like it's about, that guy has a shovel and I'm going to kill him for it.

1057
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:04,260
That guy has a shovel and I need it and I'm going to take it from him.

1058
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:12,979
Do not kill me.

1059
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:17,560
If this guy kills me with a shovel, I'm going to be pissed.

1060
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:19,880
Stop.

1061
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:26,220
Wait, mine's been broke?

1062
01:14:26,779 --> 01:14:28,460
I'm good.

1063
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:31,500
Shovel, egg, and an axe recipe.

1064
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:32,220
Oh, there we go.

1065
01:14:32,220 --> 01:14:32,859
That's what I want.

1066
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:34,310
Okay.

1067
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:35,350
I know I can make an axe.

1068
01:14:35,989 --> 01:14:37,989
I have the shovel, the stuff that I can dig up.

1069
01:14:39,670 --> 01:14:39,909
Cool.

1070
01:14:43,210 --> 01:14:43,689
I got a minute.

1071
01:14:44,329 --> 01:14:45,770
I don't have any worms.

1072
01:14:46,569 --> 01:14:48,310
Oh, hello.

1073
01:14:48,869 --> 01:14:49,560
Okay.

1074
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:50,439
I learned more about you.

1075
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:52,699
Very cool.

1076
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:56,600
I did more damage with my hands.

1077
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:57,560
That's kind of funny.

1078
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:04,779
All right.

1079
01:15:04,779 --> 01:15:06,220
I'm going to go back and make an axe.

1080
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:12,460
No, I need aging.

1081
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:21,300
Oh, I need to make an axe and I have to come and kill this thing.

1082
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:22,899
That's the play.

1083
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:29,670
The play is to make an axe, make some potions, and then come kill this thing.

1084
01:15:37,510 --> 01:15:38,149
You need to cure it.

1085
01:15:38,149 --> 01:15:38,710
Don't kill it.

1086
01:15:40,949 --> 01:15:43,510
I need, I don't have enough materials to do that.

1087
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:44,630
Wait, pick these up.

1088
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,199
I could have just walked over there.

1089
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:50,569
Are you serious?

1090
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:53,029
I walked up the other side.

1091
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:59,220
So if I make a bunch of healing potions, I can cure that instead of kill it.

1092
01:16:02,069 --> 01:16:02,310
All right.

1093
01:16:02,310 --> 01:16:03,670
I need to get materials.

1094
01:16:05,850 --> 01:16:09,609
It's aloe and then some fish bones.

1095
01:16:09,609 --> 01:16:09,850
All right.

1096
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:18,819
More rats, wild rat.

1097
01:16:20,979 --> 01:16:24,100
You can learn about them and then eventually you can tame them, I think.

1098
01:16:29,189 --> 01:16:31,989
Sword can be found here on random chance.

1099
01:16:31,989 --> 01:16:32,869
I would love a sword.

1100
01:16:36,859 --> 01:16:37,420
All right.

1101
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:38,380
I'm not messing around here.

1102
01:16:40,229 --> 01:16:42,069
What the fuck is that thing?

1103
01:16:42,069 --> 01:16:43,350
What is that thing?

1104
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:44,949
Is that thing, is that thing hostile?

1105
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:48,810
A fawn.

1106
01:16:49,449 --> 01:16:53,930
Let's get a bunch of chicken friends on learn about them.

1107
01:16:56,539 --> 01:16:56,859
Chicken.

1108
01:17:04,710 --> 01:17:05,670
I'm not fucking with that.

1109
01:17:07,770 --> 01:17:08,010
All right.

1110
01:17:08,010 --> 01:17:08,489
I got to leave.

1111
01:17:09,529 --> 01:17:11,289
Bring sanctum to the cursed tree.

1112
01:17:12,010 --> 01:17:13,000
All right.

1113
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:13,640
I got to get out of here.

1114
01:17:19,050 --> 01:17:20,090
Oh, another message.

1115
01:17:20,649 --> 01:17:21,850
These have recipes in them.

1116
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:22,090
All right.

1117
01:17:22,090 --> 01:17:22,649
Get me out of here.

1118
01:17:23,619 --> 01:17:24,979
Sit back.

1119
01:17:24,979 --> 01:17:25,220
All right.

1120
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:25,779
Cool.

1121
01:17:25,779 --> 01:17:27,140
I think I made some progress.

1122
01:17:36,149 --> 01:17:37,270
I think that means I'm wet.

1123
01:17:37,909 --> 01:17:43,319
They're all going to die of corruption.

1124
01:17:43,319 --> 01:17:43,960
I think they leave.

1125
01:17:47,449 --> 01:17:49,770
I need one more mandragora and I know what it does.

1126
01:17:55,159 --> 01:17:56,840
I need fish bones.

1127
01:17:57,640 --> 01:18:02,090
I got all kinds of bullshit in my inventory.

1128
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:02,329
All right.

1129
01:18:02,329 --> 01:18:03,529
What about making the axe?

1130
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:06,380
I think I have a lot of materials.

1131
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:09,380
Did you get chin surgery?

1132
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:10,180
All right.

1133
01:18:10,180 --> 01:18:10,659
What do you think?

1134
01:18:10,659 --> 01:18:11,300
Do you think it looks good?

1135
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:19,130
Oh, I need to learn it.

1136
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:20,739
Axe recipe.

1137
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:24,149
Do I have any more recipes to dip?

1138
01:18:24,149 --> 01:18:27,289
What's that?

1139
01:18:28,789 --> 01:18:29,909
Stag recipe?

1140
01:18:30,550 --> 01:18:32,859
It's a stag.

1141
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:39,739
I know how to make a stag.

1142
01:18:39,739 --> 01:18:40,460
What's a stag?

1143
01:18:45,260 --> 01:18:46,619
Wood, wood, wood.

1144
01:18:46,619 --> 01:18:47,420
What is a stag?

1145
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:49,960
I have that, don't I?

1146
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:52,300
Why is it not my inventory?

1147
01:18:52,859 --> 01:18:59,670
I thought I had some scrap metal.

1148
01:19:00,390 --> 01:19:00,869
Did I not?

1149
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:11,449
I'm sorry.

1150
01:19:11,449 --> 01:19:12,569
I know I'm supposed to be feeding you.

1151
01:19:13,289 --> 01:19:16,630
All right.

1152
01:19:16,630 --> 01:19:18,069
Well, I can't do that anyways.

1153
01:19:18,069 --> 01:19:18,710
Can't sleep.

1154
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:23,079
So I did it.

1155
01:19:23,079 --> 01:19:23,800
Was it in the box?

1156
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,899
I think it was in here.

1157
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:34,149
You're in the food tab at the research table.

1158
01:19:34,149 --> 01:19:35,590
You can change tabs research more.

1159
01:19:36,619 --> 01:19:36,939
Really?

1160
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:39,260
Well, I've had a bunch of wood.

1161
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:39,899
I just didn't take it.

1162
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:45,130
I like watching the funny man.

1163
01:19:45,130 --> 01:19:45,529
Thank you.

1164
01:19:50,659 --> 01:19:52,420
I think it's just whatever you have available.

1165
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:54,579
But there should be stuff in here.

1166
01:19:54,579 --> 01:19:55,140
Yeah, here we go.

1167
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:56,979
Just take it.

1168
01:19:57,779 --> 01:20:01,770
So now I should be able to do a bunch more.

1169
01:20:04,710 --> 01:20:04,949
Yeah.

1170
01:20:04,949 --> 01:20:05,590
What about cooking?

1171
01:20:10,010 --> 01:20:10,649
Make a fish?

1172
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:12,520
Seared fish?

1173
01:20:13,239 --> 01:20:15,109
I'm going to hold on to the eggs

1174
01:20:15,109 --> 01:20:16,069
because I don't want to use all these.

1175
01:20:16,069 --> 01:20:16,710
So let's go back.

1176
01:20:18,859 --> 01:20:19,420
Okay, I have...

1177
01:20:20,140 --> 01:20:22,020
Right, the digging spaces.

1178
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:22,260
Right.

1179
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:22,500
Okay.

1180
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:25,140
There was one back here.

1181
01:20:25,779 --> 01:20:27,340
Where the...

1182
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:28,220
You should dance for us.

1183
01:20:31,050 --> 01:20:31,529
No.

1184
01:20:31,529 --> 01:20:31,930
Shut up.

1185
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:35,659
I'm not going to fucking dance.

1186
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:39,319
No.

1187
01:20:39,319 --> 01:20:40,119
No weird shit.

1188
01:20:40,119 --> 01:20:41,239
This is sponsor segment.

1189
01:20:42,140 --> 01:20:42,939
Ooh.

1190
01:20:42,939 --> 01:20:44,279
What's that?

1191
01:20:47,989 --> 01:20:48,710
I don't have an axe.

1192
01:20:51,130 --> 01:20:52,970
There was stuff to dig over here.

1193
01:20:52,970 --> 01:20:53,449
Wasn't there?

1194
01:20:55,210 --> 01:20:56,170
I swear to God.

1195
01:20:56,890 --> 01:20:57,750
Yeah, there was.

1196
01:20:59,859 --> 01:21:00,340
Ooh, tea.

1197
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:03,590
I don't feel cold, so I don't eat clothes.

1198
01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:04,229
Who the fuck are you?

1199
01:21:09,670 --> 01:21:09,989
Ooh.

1200
01:21:13,079 --> 01:21:14,039
Create chicken?

1201
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:15,640
A broom recipe.

1202
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:17,930
I can make a broom?

1203
01:21:18,810 --> 01:21:22,500
Okay.

1204
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:25,460
Summon a helpful creature that will come to the user's aid.

1205
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:29,100
Do I drink this?

1206
01:21:37,420 --> 01:21:37,739
Whoa.

1207
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:40,819
Bold Lush.

1208
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:44,899
Inventory.

1209
01:21:44,899 --> 01:21:45,460
Inspect.

1210
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:45,859
Wait.

1211
01:21:45,859 --> 01:21:46,739
Go to camp.

1212
01:21:46,739 --> 01:21:47,060
Play.

1213
01:21:50,170 --> 01:21:50,890
We can play?

1214
01:21:53,539 --> 01:21:54,899
I've got a bad old chicken, I think.

1215
01:21:56,819 --> 01:21:58,020
I do have a bad old chicken.

1216
01:21:58,020 --> 01:21:58,579
Okay, hold on.

1217
01:21:59,850 --> 01:22:01,770
And the chicken can hold 10 pounds worth of stuff.

1218
01:22:02,489 --> 01:22:03,449
All right.

1219
01:22:04,439 --> 01:22:05,000
All right, cool.

1220
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:06,520
What's your deal?

1221
01:22:07,159 --> 01:22:08,199
Anastasia.

1222
01:22:08,199 --> 01:22:09,159
What are you looking at?

1223
01:22:09,159 --> 01:22:12,890
I just, I think I'm going to beat this person up.

1224
01:22:12,890 --> 01:22:14,329
I think I'm going to kill this person and take their stuff.

1225
01:22:15,050 --> 01:22:19,079
You want an age potion?

1226
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:20,279
Let's just do.

1227
01:22:25,529 --> 01:22:27,289
There's also this, which I don't know what to do with this.

1228
01:22:28,010 --> 01:22:29,770
All right, what if I throw the age potion at this?

1229
01:22:29,770 --> 01:22:30,729
Will it age to death?

1230
01:22:31,369 --> 01:22:34,420
That's a decent thought.

1231
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:36,359
Let's play.

1232
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:42,020
All right, let's deposit and then go back out with the shovel.

1233
01:22:43,449 --> 01:22:45,449
And I'm going to make an axe.

1234
01:22:45,449 --> 01:22:48,729
And I don't know how to be normal again.

1235
01:22:48,729 --> 01:22:52,779
I have three healing potions.

1236
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:55,189
Let's deposit this.

1237
01:22:55,189 --> 01:22:56,069
No, actually, I need that.

1238
01:22:58,539 --> 01:22:59,979
All right, deposit a few eggs.

1239
01:23:00,619 --> 01:23:02,279
Deposit the raw fish.

1240
01:23:02,279 --> 01:23:05,750
Get rid of the, get rid of the portable lab.

1241
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:06,390
It's just too heavy.

1242
01:23:09,210 --> 01:23:09,930
I have the shovel.

1243
01:23:10,489 --> 01:23:12,170
I don't need the tea leaves, that many at least.

1244
01:23:13,779 --> 01:23:14,100
All right.

1245
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:14,739
Okay, good.

1246
01:23:14,739 --> 01:23:15,060
Let's go.

1247
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:18,979
Let's see if I can make a, you know what I'm saying?

1248
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:23,779
Let's make this work.

1249
01:23:27,989 --> 01:23:29,350
I'll put the damage potions over here.

1250
01:23:30,550 --> 01:23:33,100
Oh, it heals the chicken too.

1251
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:36,329
That's cool.

1252
01:23:36,329 --> 01:23:39,050
Can I make a, is the chicken going to disappear?

1253
01:23:39,050 --> 01:23:41,939
Oh, I don't think there's a timer.

1254
01:23:41,939 --> 01:23:43,960
Doesn't look like it is this timer.

1255
01:23:52,710 --> 01:23:53,989
Okay, axe.

1256
01:23:53,989 --> 01:23:59,500
Can I not make an axe?

1257
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:03,689
I don't have any wood.

1258
01:24:03,689 --> 01:24:05,130
How do I not have any wood?

1259
01:24:05,130 --> 01:24:05,689
Are you kidding me?

1260
01:24:06,489 --> 01:24:07,979
Didn't I have a shitload of wood?

1261
01:24:08,619 --> 01:24:10,579
What happened to it all?

1262
01:24:10,579 --> 01:24:14,460
Where's all my wood?

1263
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:18,359
I put it away?

1264
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:19,880
Did I?

1265
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:20,840
I thought I just took it out.

1266
01:24:22,060 --> 01:24:22,699
I didn't take it.

1267
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:30,659
So I should be able to make an axe.

1268
01:24:34,979 --> 01:24:36,100
Who are these weirdos?

1269
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:43,539
No, see, where is it?

1270
01:24:44,180 --> 01:24:48,550
I had like 10 wood.

1271
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:50,619
What happened to it?

1272
01:24:50,619 --> 01:24:58,060
I dropped all the rest.

1273
01:24:58,060 --> 01:24:58,619
Oh shit.

1274
01:24:58,619 --> 01:24:59,579
Well, I have a battle chicken.

1275
01:24:59,579 --> 01:25:00,539
I'll be fine.

1276
01:25:00,539 --> 01:25:02,859
Hello, Milton.

1277
01:25:02,859 --> 01:25:06,020
Oh, you have so much stuff.

1278
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:07,850
I can't just like break this over your head.

1279
01:25:08,409 --> 01:25:10,729
I got a battle chicken.

1280
01:25:10,729 --> 01:25:11,529
I'll be fine.

1281
01:25:11,529 --> 01:25:16,229
Jibber, why are you being so regular?

1282
01:25:17,939 --> 01:25:25,689
I have the shovel.

1283
01:25:25,689 --> 01:25:26,329
I should be okay.

1284
01:25:26,890 --> 01:25:31,670
This is technically a weapon.

1285
01:25:31,670 --> 01:25:32,630
So let's go.

1286
01:25:32,630 --> 01:25:36,579
I need wood and I need more materials

1287
01:25:36,579 --> 01:25:37,380
and I need meat too.

1288
01:25:37,939 --> 01:25:39,880
Okay, let's go.

1289
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:45,699
All right, follow me.

1290
01:25:46,420 --> 01:25:49,260
Try, just try to kill this thing with a shovel.

1291
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:51,899
That's going to take me a while to heal this thing to death.

1292
01:25:51,899 --> 01:25:56,630
Now, there's a lot of chickens here.

1293
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:00,420
All right, discover the chicken.

1294
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:02,630
Interesting.

1295
01:26:04,739 --> 01:26:06,340
Oh, I need the mandrake worth.

1296
01:26:10,489 --> 01:26:11,050
Watch out.

1297
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:18,489
Get him, get him, get him, get him.

1298
01:26:18,489 --> 01:26:19,369
Get him, chicken.

1299
01:26:20,090 --> 01:26:20,920
Should I?

1300
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:24,539
All right, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.

1301
01:26:24,539 --> 01:26:25,260
Don't get killed.

1302
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:26,220
Don't get killed, don't get killed.

1303
01:26:29,189 --> 01:26:30,470
I'm going to break this shovel.

1304
01:26:30,470 --> 01:26:31,189
I need it.

1305
01:26:31,189 --> 01:26:39,140
Oh no, the chicken's dead.

1306
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:46,659
How am I supposed to stop that from happening?

1307
01:26:48,220 --> 01:26:48,859
Inspect?

1308
01:26:53,399 --> 01:26:53,960
Oh no.

1309
01:27:10,140 --> 01:27:11,020
I need the meat.

1310
01:27:14,489 --> 01:27:15,449
I need the meat.

1311
01:27:15,449 --> 01:27:16,890
I need the meat for the dog.

1312
01:27:16,890 --> 01:27:18,329
The dog is starving right now.

1313
01:27:20,869 --> 01:27:21,270
Shit.

1314
01:27:21,270 --> 01:27:22,229
Okay, all right, all right.

1315
01:27:22,229 --> 01:27:23,109
I need to hold digging.

1316
01:27:30,630 --> 01:27:32,550
The dog eats meat.

1317
01:27:32,550 --> 01:27:33,350
I need to feed the dog.

1318
01:27:33,909 --> 01:27:37,079
Still can't open that.

1319
01:27:37,079 --> 01:27:37,960
All right, 69%.

1320
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,199
And there's rats.

1321
01:27:40,199 --> 01:27:41,239
These are corrupted rats.

1322
01:27:41,239 --> 01:27:46,260
Wait, did it work?

1323
01:27:49,399 --> 01:27:49,800
What the?

1324
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:50,680
It doesn't work.

1325
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:51,319
I didn't heal him.

1326
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:56,810
Don't touch me.

1327
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:01,859
Come here.

1328
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:03,140
Get over here.

1329
01:28:04,550 --> 01:28:05,909
Healing is not curing?

1330
01:28:06,470 --> 01:28:09,619
Where did that thing go?

1331
01:28:10,869 --> 01:28:11,350
Come here.

1332
01:28:18,039 --> 01:28:19,000
All right, I don't want to die.

1333
01:28:20,090 --> 01:28:21,369
All right, we got lots of meat.

1334
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:22,729
I got bones.

1335
01:28:22,729 --> 01:28:23,289
This is perfect.

1336
01:28:23,850 --> 01:28:25,460
We'll be able to heal the dog.

1337
01:28:29,619 --> 01:28:30,500
I killed the chicken.

1338
01:28:31,319 --> 01:28:32,840
Well, I didn't mean to kill the chicken.

1339
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:34,520
The chicken died because it was being attacked.

1340
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:39,210
Okay, I think I have enough meat to have the dog be my friend.

1341
01:28:45,050 --> 01:28:45,609
Get out of here.

1342
01:28:45,609 --> 01:28:46,569
Leave me alone.

1343
01:28:46,569 --> 01:28:46,970
You know what?

1344
01:28:47,689 --> 01:28:52,680
Okay, discovered that.

1345
01:28:54,409 --> 01:28:55,770
Okay, let's go back and feed the dog.

1346
01:29:02,329 --> 01:29:04,649
You watch me on a hacked smart fridge.

1347
01:29:04,649 --> 01:29:07,340
That's kind of weird.

1348
01:29:10,460 --> 01:29:12,300
Your fists are doing more damage than the shovel.

1349
01:29:12,859 --> 01:29:15,800
So how do I make a cure?

1350
01:29:16,439 --> 01:29:19,109
All right, here we go.

1351
01:29:20,329 --> 01:29:21,289
Mandragora.

1352
01:29:21,289 --> 01:29:21,930
Completely.

1353
01:29:22,649 --> 01:29:24,010
All right, this is change.

1354
01:29:24,890 --> 01:29:28,619
Charcoal is...

1355
01:29:29,420 --> 01:29:32,090
All right, a mandragora is change?

1356
01:29:32,890 --> 01:29:36,100
Something change into something else?

1357
01:29:36,819 --> 01:29:40,340
Interesting.

1358
01:29:42,010 --> 01:29:42,409
Change.

1359
01:29:42,970 --> 01:29:47,659
All right, I need to put in some stuff.

1360
01:29:48,220 --> 01:29:51,109
Maybe heal, change?

1361
01:29:51,829 --> 01:29:53,560
That's possible.

1362
01:29:54,119 --> 01:29:57,270
Let me look at the journal for a second.

1363
01:30:00,539 --> 01:30:00,859
Quest.

1364
01:30:00,859 --> 01:30:02,140
All right, research shell.

1365
01:30:04,119 --> 01:30:05,319
Open the moonstone chest.

1366
01:30:06,119 --> 01:30:07,720
Bring sanctum to the curse tree.

1367
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:09,159
Feed the well a hundred times.

1368
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:10,680
Clear the passage.

1369
01:30:12,630 --> 01:30:13,270
No requests.

1370
01:30:13,270 --> 01:30:13,989
All right, hold on.

1371
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:16,470
Right, here we go.

1372
01:30:17,270 --> 01:30:20,439
Charcoal is age.

1373
01:30:21,079 --> 01:30:23,449
Fish bones are the thing you need.

1374
01:30:23,449 --> 01:30:25,529
It's like a quantity.

1375
01:30:28,710 --> 01:30:30,310
Shells, I think, are also that too.

1376
01:30:32,140 --> 01:30:33,819
All right, I need fish bones and shells.

1377
01:30:33,819 --> 01:30:36,630
That should work.

1378
01:30:36,630 --> 01:30:44,789
German, get weird.

1379
01:30:45,590 --> 01:30:46,390
Act weird.

1380
01:30:49,289 --> 01:30:50,569
I don't need to act weird right now.

1381
01:30:51,369 --> 01:30:56,630
Why I gotta act weird?

1382
01:30:56,630 --> 01:30:57,750
I don't need to act weird.

1383
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:00,180
You're acting weird.

1384
01:31:00,180 --> 01:31:00,979
You're being weird.

1385
01:31:01,539 --> 01:31:08,569
All right, I should be able to make some more healing.

1386
01:31:08,569 --> 01:31:10,090
I should be able to make some more healing potions.

1387
01:31:10,649 --> 01:31:11,899
Is that weird for you?

1388
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:15,460
Do you get botox?

1389
01:31:19,510 --> 01:31:21,270
No, I don't.

1390
01:31:22,409 --> 01:31:23,850
I don't get botox.

1391
01:31:23,850 --> 01:31:25,210
Why do people think I get botox?

1392
01:31:25,770 --> 01:31:28,500
Why is it a thing I'm seeing recently?

1393
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:31,449
Ah, dude, so you get like botox.

1394
01:31:31,449 --> 01:31:31,689
What?

1395
01:31:33,479 --> 01:31:33,720
See?

1396
01:31:34,359 --> 01:31:36,039
You're making me lose materials right now.

1397
01:31:36,039 --> 01:31:40,039
All right, I'm done.

1398
01:31:40,039 --> 01:31:40,279
Look.

1399
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:47,510
See those wrinkles?

1400
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:49,479
Too close.

1401
01:31:49,479 --> 01:31:50,359
Way too close.

1402
01:31:51,159 --> 01:31:52,039
Way too close.

1403
01:31:54,380 --> 01:31:55,020
Okay, here we go.

1404
01:31:55,020 --> 01:31:55,899
Vitality, add.

1405
01:31:56,619 --> 01:31:59,140
What about remove 10 vitality, right?

1406
01:32:02,359 --> 01:32:04,619
Add 10 vitality.

1407
01:32:04,619 --> 01:32:05,899
What about remove 10 vitality?

1408
01:32:05,899 --> 01:32:06,859
That's like a damage potion?

1409
01:32:12,069 --> 01:32:16,310
Remove 10 change.

1410
01:32:16,310 --> 01:32:22,600
Okay, all right.

1411
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:23,640
So I need more aloe.

1412
01:32:24,199 --> 01:32:24,920
Get berries too.

1413
01:32:27,189 --> 01:32:29,109
Okay, that satisfied us for the next 30 minutes.

1414
01:32:29,109 --> 01:32:29,829
Good.

1415
01:32:29,829 --> 01:32:42,939
I'll go ahead and smash her in the head.

1416
01:32:44,539 --> 01:32:46,060
Who is this person?

1417
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:46,539
Bridget?

1418
01:32:50,569 --> 01:32:51,770
Whoa, you have a snake.

1419
01:32:51,770 --> 01:33:00,920
So what are you doing here?

1420
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:02,659
Do you want to share this?

1421
01:33:06,329 --> 01:33:08,810
You have two pieces of hair and a shovel.

1422
01:33:08,810 --> 01:33:12,949
What about your little snake friend?

1423
01:33:12,949 --> 01:33:13,670
Snake.

1424
01:33:13,670 --> 01:33:15,029
Oh, I can feed the snake.

1425
01:33:15,029 --> 01:33:19,529
The creature already has a master.

1426
01:33:23,529 --> 01:33:28,010
Yeah, I can't throw this at this lady, right?

1427
01:33:31,270 --> 01:33:32,869
No, I'm going to be a menace.

1428
01:33:32,869 --> 01:33:33,829
I don't want to do that right now.

1429
01:33:36,729 --> 01:33:37,449
I would be a menace.

1430
01:33:41,979 --> 01:33:44,779
I need to get wood and charcoal.

1431
01:33:48,939 --> 01:33:51,500
I need to cure or kill that creature.

1432
01:33:57,829 --> 01:33:58,630
All right, cook.

1433
01:34:01,220 --> 01:34:02,899
I need to make a regular steak to feed the dog.

1434
01:34:02,899 --> 01:34:04,180
And then maybe the dog can come with me.

1435
01:34:04,899 --> 01:34:12,409
The dog can probably come with me.

1436
01:34:17,289 --> 01:34:18,489
A hunger obtained.

1437
01:34:18,489 --> 01:34:19,529
A coin obtained.

1438
01:34:19,529 --> 01:34:20,010
Wait, what?

1439
01:34:22,890 --> 01:34:24,729
Makes the target hungrier.

1440
01:34:24,729 --> 01:34:27,689
What's the application for that?

1441
01:34:29,930 --> 01:34:30,810
I know you want to eat.

1442
01:34:30,810 --> 01:34:31,130
I know.

1443
01:34:32,119 --> 01:34:32,600
I got you.

1444
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:32,920
Don't worry.

1445
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:40,869
I have some raw meat.

1446
01:34:40,869 --> 01:34:41,430
I need to cook it.

1447
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:43,560
Is there a fire right here?

1448
01:34:44,199 --> 01:34:48,390
Oh, shit.

1449
01:34:48,949 --> 01:34:53,350
How can people have highlighted purple chats?

1450
01:34:54,250 --> 01:34:56,409
Well, that's because they are using channel points.

1451
01:34:57,050 --> 01:35:02,420
A revitalizing potion to reduce.

1452
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:15,020
Does that work?

1453
01:35:15,579 --> 01:35:17,899
Would this technically turn me away from a skeleton?

1454
01:35:23,859 --> 01:35:24,819
Okay, that's not working.

1455
01:35:27,939 --> 01:35:30,180
All right, I just want to make a couple of choices.

1456
01:35:30,180 --> 01:35:31,300
I'll make three choice steaks.

1457
01:35:31,859 --> 01:35:33,220
I don't have any wood.

1458
01:35:33,220 --> 01:35:34,180
God damn it.

1459
01:35:34,180 --> 01:35:37,430
I need I need wood.

1460
01:35:37,430 --> 01:35:43,770
Oh, this guy has his hair.

1461
01:35:44,329 --> 01:35:46,949
I need wood.

1462
01:35:50,069 --> 01:35:50,869
Where do I get wood?

1463
01:35:56,060 --> 01:35:56,619
All right, stop.

1464
01:35:57,180 --> 01:36:05,819
I need better planning.

1465
01:36:05,819 --> 01:36:07,960
This is to go to the cemetery.

1466
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:09,720
I need where did I get the wood last time?

1467
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:10,600
Just breaking boxes.

1468
01:36:22,119 --> 01:36:24,039
All right, I'm going to teleport over there again.

1469
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,510
I still have the shovel.

1470
01:36:27,510 --> 01:36:28,229
I have a torch too.

1471
01:36:28,229 --> 01:36:29,029
Wait, will this work?

1472
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:31,079
Hold on.

1473
01:36:31,079 --> 01:36:31,640
Let me try something.

1474
01:36:36,659 --> 01:36:37,380
Will this stop this?

1475
01:36:40,149 --> 01:36:40,949
Oh, it does.

1476
01:36:40,949 --> 01:36:41,750
All right, all right, all right.

1477
01:36:41,750 --> 01:36:42,310
I got something.

1478
01:36:44,039 --> 01:36:44,760
Set on fire.

1479
01:36:46,409 --> 01:36:46,890
Oh, yeah.

1480
01:36:50,090 --> 01:36:51,770
I thought I could use a regular torch.

1481
01:36:51,770 --> 01:36:57,140
So where does this go?

1482
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:02,199
Pack.

1483
01:37:03,399 --> 01:37:04,119
Fish bones.

1484
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:05,479
Chicken form.

1485
01:37:06,039 --> 01:37:08,810
I can go to the pier.

1486
01:37:12,020 --> 01:37:19,430
Why is this different?

1487
01:37:20,329 --> 01:37:20,970
Music change.

1488
01:37:21,609 --> 01:37:23,130
Pick lock recipe.

1489
01:37:23,130 --> 01:37:23,689
Get away from me.

1490
01:37:24,569 --> 01:37:24,970
Get away.

1491
01:37:24,970 --> 01:37:25,369
Get away.

1492
01:37:27,689 --> 01:37:28,250
Leave me alone.

1493
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:28,810
Don't take anything.

1494
01:37:30,199 --> 01:37:30,840
Get out of here.

1495
01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:34,340
Oh, I can open the chest now.

1496
01:37:38,170 --> 01:37:39,289
That chest that needs a lockpick.

1497
01:37:39,289 --> 01:37:39,770
I can open it.

1498
01:37:43,289 --> 01:37:43,689
Coins.

1499
01:37:54,329 --> 01:37:55,369
We're purple pals.

1500
01:37:55,930 --> 01:38:03,720
All right, I don't want to get killed.

1501
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:07,079
The worms.

1502
01:38:07,079 --> 01:38:10,970
Okay.

1503
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:14,979
Ooh, what's over there?

1504
01:38:15,699 --> 01:38:19,539
I think I have to rebuild the bridge probably.

1505
01:38:21,140 --> 01:38:24,260
Looks like the Wild West.

1506
01:38:24,899 --> 01:38:26,340
Press this phone.

1507
01:38:26,340 --> 01:38:29,340
I don't want to kill this, but is it hostile?

1508
01:38:29,979 --> 01:38:30,300
It's not.

1509
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:35,289
I do want the fish bones, but I don't want to kill it.

1510
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:38,680
Where's my shovel?

1511
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:47,779
We got what was that?

1512
01:38:50,329 --> 01:38:51,050
Restlessness?

1513
01:38:52,810 --> 01:38:55,449
Transforms the target into a restless version of himself.

1514
01:38:58,899 --> 01:39:02,260
Can I turn this into a chicken with this?

1515
01:39:03,140 --> 01:39:03,859
Is that how that works?

1516
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:10,409
Like, if I threw that at the big scary guy,

1517
01:39:10,409 --> 01:39:11,449
would it turn into a chicken?

1518
01:39:12,170 --> 01:39:13,899
I'm going to try it.

1519
01:39:22,100 --> 01:39:22,579
Oh, shit.

1520
01:39:22,579 --> 01:39:22,979
Who's this?

1521
01:39:26,699 --> 01:39:27,500
I need wood.

1522
01:39:28,539 --> 01:39:29,500
I need wood.

1523
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:29,979
So bad.

1524
01:39:30,619 --> 01:39:35,029
Put this away.

1525
01:39:35,989 --> 01:39:38,149
I'm going to put a lot of these potions away

1526
01:39:38,149 --> 01:39:39,189
because I really don't know what to do with them.

1527
01:39:39,829 --> 01:39:43,220
Put the heavy stuff away.

1528
01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:45,909
Oh, pick lock.

1529
01:39:45,909 --> 01:39:46,149
Yep.

1530
01:39:46,869 --> 01:39:49,640
I'll keep the damage.

1531
01:39:50,359 --> 01:39:53,590
I'll keep the spores.

1532
01:39:53,590 --> 01:39:54,149
Is there a bench?

1533
01:39:54,149 --> 01:39:54,869
You got a bench in here?

1534
01:39:55,670 --> 01:39:58,819
It's been a long time since I last seen one of your kind here at me docks.

1535
01:39:59,539 --> 01:40:00,659
I'd be the harbormaster,

1536
01:40:00,659 --> 01:40:01,699
welcomer of lost souls,

1537
01:40:01,699 --> 01:40:02,819
receiver of others' gold,

1538
01:40:02,819 --> 01:40:05,859
and ye came seeking respite from the Vanlands, eh?

1539
01:40:06,899 --> 01:40:08,579
What says he, warden?

1540
01:40:08,579 --> 01:40:10,899
Can you bargain for a few companion souls?

1541
01:40:10,899 --> 01:40:17,109
The pier is a grim place where you can find souls bound to a nameless ship.

1542
01:40:17,829 --> 01:40:21,350
The only way to set them free is to bargain with the harbormaster using gold coins.

1543
01:40:21,989 --> 01:40:26,180
They will become followers.

1544
01:40:27,819 --> 01:40:30,390
So no ship, no business.

1545
01:40:30,390 --> 01:40:31,029
Come back later.

1546
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:34,359
Is it one dollar right here?

1547
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:39,479
How much money do I have?

1548
01:40:39,479 --> 01:40:40,600
I have 81 bucks.

1549
01:40:45,770 --> 01:40:47,289
Oh, it's counting it.

1550
01:40:47,289 --> 01:40:47,850
I get it.

1551
01:40:47,850 --> 01:40:49,449
When that fills up, it'll be here.

1552
01:40:50,170 --> 01:40:53,979
Okay.

1553
01:40:53,979 --> 01:40:55,579
Well, I know how to do a lockpick now.

1554
01:40:57,079 --> 01:40:57,800
Hi, Andrew.

1555
01:41:01,619 --> 01:41:02,979
You have a little chicken.

1556
01:41:04,020 --> 01:41:05,380
That's such a funny companion.

1557
01:41:08,579 --> 01:41:10,659
Your two companions are like a baby chicken.

1558
01:41:11,739 --> 01:41:12,380
I want that.

1559
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:20,119
He takes one glance over and sees that we're still doing the same shit.

1560
01:41:20,119 --> 01:41:20,600
Oh, yeah.

1561
01:41:21,909 --> 01:41:25,989
I take a quick look over and I see the redeeming winks.

1562
01:41:27,239 --> 01:41:29,000
That hasn't been a thing in like three years.

1563
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:34,439
Okay, so that opens the pier.

1564
01:41:42,260 --> 01:41:43,060
I need...

1565
01:41:43,060 --> 01:41:43,939
Where do I get wood?

1566
01:41:44,659 --> 01:41:45,300
Reliably.

1567
01:41:54,949 --> 01:41:55,670
Okay.

1568
01:41:55,670 --> 01:41:56,630
I need wood.

1569
01:41:56,630 --> 01:41:57,909
Otherwise, I can't feed the dog.

1570
01:41:59,539 --> 01:42:00,420
I have no weapons.

1571
01:42:01,619 --> 01:42:02,260
I'm fucked.

1572
01:42:04,220 --> 01:42:04,779
I have this.

1573
01:42:04,779 --> 01:42:05,180
This is it.

1574
01:42:05,180 --> 01:42:05,739
That's all I have.

1575
01:42:16,140 --> 01:42:17,020
In barrels, maybe?

1576
01:42:17,579 --> 01:42:21,060
Where was I getting wood before?

1577
01:42:21,539 --> 01:42:28,920
These mushrooms?

1578
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:32,970
Ooh, cut mushroom.

1579
01:42:35,319 --> 01:42:35,800
Oh, fuck.

1580
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:36,359
94%.

1581
01:42:36,359 --> 01:42:37,159
Get out.

1582
01:42:37,159 --> 01:42:39,239
I got more...

1583
01:42:40,119 --> 01:42:41,899
Get me out.

1584
01:42:41,899 --> 01:42:45,750
We got a double wink?

1585
01:42:45,750 --> 01:42:53,319
Oh, there's a new one.

1586
01:42:56,229 --> 01:43:00,739
Damage potions, rejuvenation potions, and aging potions.

1587
01:43:00,739 --> 01:43:03,420
I think I have a couple of these, don't I?

1588
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:07,380
Okay.

1589
01:43:07,380 --> 01:43:09,590
I already have these in my inventory.

1590
01:43:09,590 --> 01:43:16,340
Where's my money?

1591
01:43:16,340 --> 01:43:19,609
Where's my money?

1592
01:43:19,609 --> 01:43:21,260
Oh, it just goes right in your inventory.

1593
01:43:21,260 --> 01:43:24,250
Okay.

1594
01:43:24,250 --> 01:43:26,619
Oh, you ordered that.

1595
01:43:26,619 --> 01:43:28,140
R1, R1, R1, R1.

1596
01:43:35,640 --> 01:43:38,140
This thing is still here.

1597
01:43:38,140 --> 01:43:48,380
Can I pick this up?

1598
01:43:48,380 --> 01:43:49,579
Oh, your lockpick recipe.

1599
01:43:49,579 --> 01:43:54,840
Thank you.

1600
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:55,560
More research.

1601
01:43:56,199 --> 01:43:57,619
Okay.

1602
01:43:57,619 --> 01:44:07,670
I need logs, bones, spores, sulfur.

1603
01:44:09,340 --> 01:44:09,579
Okay.

1604
01:44:09,579 --> 01:44:10,619
I can make some more potions.

1605
01:44:11,260 --> 01:44:16,329
Vitality.

1606
01:44:16,329 --> 01:44:17,609
I need aloe.

1607
01:44:17,609 --> 01:44:23,109
I don't need more worms, do I?

1608
01:44:23,109 --> 01:44:23,430
No.

1609
01:44:23,430 --> 01:44:24,149
I need aloe.

1610
01:44:24,869 --> 01:44:27,829
Do remove plus restless.

1611
01:44:29,510 --> 01:44:31,270
Ah, will that actually work?

1612
01:44:31,909 --> 01:44:37,399
Remove...

1613
01:44:37,399 --> 01:44:38,039
I don't have...

1614
01:44:38,039 --> 01:44:39,560
Wait, will that actually work?

1615
01:44:40,119 --> 01:44:47,380
Do you hide money in your walls?

1616
01:44:48,260 --> 01:44:48,500
No.

1617
01:44:50,489 --> 01:44:51,050
Remove...

1618
01:44:51,689 --> 01:44:54,140
What was restless?

1619
01:44:55,899 --> 01:44:56,380
Charcoal?

1620
01:44:58,979 --> 01:44:59,939
I don't have any charcoal.

1621
01:45:00,579 --> 01:45:03,100
I need to...

1622
01:45:03,100 --> 01:45:04,539
I need to cut a tree down, but I need...

1623
01:45:04,539 --> 01:45:05,899
I don't have an axe.

1624
01:45:05,899 --> 01:45:10,500
I can make these.

1625
01:45:17,399 --> 01:45:17,880
Add...

1626
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:18,119
Yeah.

1627
01:45:18,119 --> 01:45:19,159
Give me some healing potions.

1628
01:45:20,039 --> 01:45:23,609
All right.

1629
01:45:23,609 --> 01:45:25,449
That's literally 10 healing potions.

1630
01:45:25,449 --> 01:45:26,729
I'm unstoppable.

1631
01:45:26,729 --> 01:45:31,750
Okay.

1632
01:45:31,750 --> 01:45:32,630
Restlessness.

1633
01:45:32,630 --> 01:45:34,229
Change restlessness.

1634
01:45:34,229 --> 01:45:35,590
I need to remove restlessness.

1635
01:45:36,810 --> 01:45:37,449
Don't...

1636
01:45:37,449 --> 01:45:37,770
No.

1637
01:45:37,770 --> 01:45:38,649
Stop drinking it.

1638
01:45:38,649 --> 01:45:39,529
Don't do that again.

1639
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:41,640
All right.

1640
01:45:41,640 --> 01:45:42,439
I'm good.

1641
01:45:42,439 --> 01:45:51,100
I need...

1642
01:45:51,659 --> 01:45:53,020
Portable lab is just wasting much.

1643
01:45:53,020 --> 01:45:53,260
Okay.

1644
01:45:53,260 --> 01:45:53,659
Let's go.

1645
01:45:54,380 --> 01:45:57,319
All right.

1646
01:45:58,060 --> 01:45:58,939
I'm going up there.

1647
01:45:58,939 --> 01:45:59,899
I don't care if I get killed.

1648
01:46:05,689 --> 01:46:06,970
I have some decent money too.

1649
01:46:06,970 --> 01:46:08,170
What can I do with it?

1650
01:46:08,170 --> 01:46:14,170
Is this like Terraria?

1651
01:46:17,350 --> 01:46:18,069
Maybe a little.

1652
01:46:18,710 --> 01:46:20,300
I can make a room.

1653
01:46:20,300 --> 01:46:20,699
I just need...

1654
01:46:21,779 --> 01:46:23,539
I'm just going on a wood collection.

1655
01:46:23,539 --> 01:46:25,060
I don't care if I have to punch a tree.

1656
01:46:25,060 --> 01:46:25,460
I don't care.

1657
01:46:26,100 --> 01:46:28,329
I'm going to go punch a tree

1658
01:46:28,329 --> 01:46:29,289
until I get enough berries.

1659
01:46:29,850 --> 01:46:33,430
My character sucks.

1660
01:46:33,430 --> 01:46:33,750
I did it.

1661
01:46:33,750 --> 01:46:34,630
I did it to myself.

1662
01:46:35,189 --> 01:46:37,399
All right.

1663
01:46:37,399 --> 01:46:38,920
You're hungry, but you eat raw meat, right?

1664
01:46:39,479 --> 01:46:46,149
Want some more?

1665
01:46:52,220 --> 01:46:52,859
Right, dear.

1666
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:55,659
Ooh.

1667
01:46:56,220 --> 01:46:58,439
Okay.

1668
01:46:59,380 --> 01:47:00,659
This thing's actually pretty powerful.

1669
01:47:00,659 --> 01:47:01,779
I don't want this to die.

1670
01:47:01,779 --> 01:47:02,699
Let's play.

1671
01:47:06,460 --> 01:47:08,539
I really don't want this thing to die,

1672
01:47:09,539 --> 01:47:10,420
but I need its help.

1673
01:47:10,420 --> 01:47:11,060
So we're going to go.

1674
01:47:11,619 --> 01:47:18,939
I need wood.

1675
01:47:18,939 --> 01:47:27,739
Fucking...

1676
01:47:27,739 --> 01:47:27,979
No.

1677
01:47:27,979 --> 01:47:28,380
All right.

1678
01:47:28,380 --> 01:47:32,859
Wood.

1679
01:47:32,859 --> 01:47:34,699
I need this fucking tree to go down.

1680
01:47:34,699 --> 01:47:34,939
All right.

1681
01:47:34,939 --> 01:47:39,720
Can I blow it up or something?

1682
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:40,439
Shells, right?

1683
01:47:42,199 --> 01:47:43,000
Okay.

1684
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:43,960
Be careful.

1685
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:47,180
Don't get killed, dear.

1686
01:47:47,180 --> 01:47:49,689
I need wood.

1687
01:47:49,689 --> 01:47:50,489
It's going to die.

1688
01:47:50,489 --> 01:47:51,369
It's not going to die.

1689
01:47:51,369 --> 01:47:52,409
I can teleport.

1690
01:47:52,409 --> 01:48:01,800
Just don't aggro the huge thing.

1691
01:48:10,539 --> 01:48:11,899
I need logs so bad.

1692
01:48:11,899 --> 01:48:12,460
All right.

1693
01:48:12,460 --> 01:48:13,260
Wait here.

1694
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:14,140
Don't go anywhere.

1695
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:26,300
Am I opening this?

1696
01:48:26,859 --> 01:48:27,819
Did it open?

1697
01:48:27,819 --> 01:48:31,699
Okay.

1698
01:48:31,699 --> 01:48:34,699
I guess that's a lot.

1699
01:48:35,340 --> 01:48:36,539
I got a sword recipe now.

1700
01:48:37,100 --> 01:48:38,810
Okay.

1701
01:48:38,810 --> 01:48:41,380
Now we just need logs.

1702
01:48:41,380 --> 01:48:45,340
Now come with me.

1703
01:48:47,930 --> 01:48:48,729
Follow me.

1704
01:48:48,729 --> 01:48:54,390
Help me find logs.

1705
01:48:54,390 --> 01:48:54,630
All right.

1706
01:48:54,630 --> 01:48:55,829
I'm just killing that thing, by the way.

1707
01:48:55,829 --> 01:48:56,390
I'm making a sword.

1708
01:48:56,390 --> 01:48:57,189
I'm going to kill it.

1709
01:48:57,189 --> 01:49:04,520
A ship with fresh shells.

1710
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:04,760
Okay.

1711
01:49:08,180 --> 01:49:08,579
Watch out.

1712
01:49:08,579 --> 01:49:09,300
Don't let it blow up on you.

1713
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:10,260
Watch out.

1714
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:12,220
We got to kill this thing.

1715
01:49:12,220 --> 01:49:18,329
All right.

1716
01:49:18,329 --> 01:49:21,100
Good work.

1717
01:49:21,100 --> 01:49:22,380
Dog's actually really good.

1718
01:49:22,380 --> 01:49:23,020
Very powerful.

1719
01:49:23,819 --> 01:49:24,779
Highly recommend.

1720
01:49:24,779 --> 01:49:30,140
52%.

1721
01:49:30,140 --> 01:49:30,460
All right.

1722
01:49:30,460 --> 01:49:32,539
I need logs.

1723
01:49:32,539 --> 01:49:41,500
Got to get it.

1724
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:45,720
Okay.

1725
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:51,369
Where do I find logs without an axe?

1726
01:49:51,369 --> 01:49:52,489
Don't just kill random...

1727
01:49:52,489 --> 01:49:52,729
All right.

1728
01:49:52,729 --> 01:49:53,130
No, no, no.

1729
01:49:53,130 --> 01:49:54,010
We're getting close.

1730
01:49:54,890 --> 01:49:55,130
Wait.

1731
01:49:55,130 --> 01:49:55,449
No, no.

1732
01:49:55,449 --> 01:49:56,170
Don't eat these.

1733
01:49:56,729 --> 01:49:58,010
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

1734
01:49:58,010 --> 01:49:58,329
You don't...

1735
01:49:58,329 --> 01:49:58,970
That's not...

1736
01:49:58,970 --> 01:49:59,449
Don't do that.

1737
01:50:00,579 --> 01:50:01,539
They're so cute.

1738
01:50:06,949 --> 01:50:07,350
All right.

1739
01:50:07,350 --> 01:50:10,979
You have moonstone and a wild chicken.

1740
01:50:10,979 --> 01:50:14,359
I got a moonstone.

1741
01:50:14,359 --> 01:50:14,600
Okay.

1742
01:50:23,020 --> 01:50:23,500
Percy?

1743
01:50:24,060 --> 01:50:32,539
Is that bad?

1744
01:50:32,539 --> 01:50:33,260
Oops.

1745
01:50:33,260 --> 01:50:35,750
Oh, I got a ghoul.

1746
01:50:35,750 --> 01:50:36,550
Wait, what's that?

1747
01:50:36,550 --> 01:50:45,590
Should I not have done that?

1748
01:50:45,590 --> 01:50:47,109
Oops.

1749
01:50:47,109 --> 01:50:48,550
Well, they were like corrupted.

1750
01:50:48,550 --> 01:50:50,229
They were like a corrupted skeleton person.

1751
01:50:50,229 --> 01:50:53,260
I had to fucking kill them.

1752
01:50:53,260 --> 01:50:53,899
Okay.

1753
01:50:53,899 --> 01:50:56,659
How are you doing on health?

1754
01:50:56,659 --> 01:51:00,859
Are you okay?

1755
01:51:00,859 --> 01:51:01,659
You're good, right?

1756
01:51:01,659 --> 01:51:06,060
All right.

1757
01:51:06,060 --> 01:51:07,260
Seriously, I need logs.

1758
01:51:07,739 --> 01:51:11,640
How was I getting them before?

1759
01:51:11,640 --> 01:51:15,609
I don't remember.

1760
01:51:15,609 --> 01:51:16,329
Save that guy.

1761
01:51:16,329 --> 01:51:16,970
He's already dead.

1762
01:51:16,970 --> 01:51:20,279
All right.

1763
01:51:20,279 --> 01:51:21,239
There's a torch.

1764
01:51:21,239 --> 01:51:27,619
This is that multiplayer?

1765
01:51:27,619 --> 01:51:28,579
I don't think so.

1766
01:51:28,579 --> 01:51:33,430
Where can I get some logs to make some stuff?

1767
01:51:35,939 --> 01:51:38,100
I think I just sapped this whole place of logs.

1768
01:51:38,659 --> 01:51:41,189
Okay.

1769
01:51:41,189 --> 01:51:42,470
I don't want to fuck with this thing.

1770
01:51:42,470 --> 01:51:48,550
What's fighting?

1771
01:51:48,550 --> 01:51:49,699
Look, they're in here.

1772
01:51:49,699 --> 01:51:50,500
I just can't get them.

1773
01:51:55,779 --> 01:51:57,220
No, don't heal them, you idiot.

1774
01:51:57,220 --> 01:51:58,020
What are you doing?

1775
01:51:58,020 --> 01:51:58,579
Put that away.

1776
01:52:03,880 --> 01:52:04,520
The dog.

1777
01:52:05,909 --> 01:52:06,149
No.

1778
01:52:07,270 --> 01:52:08,789
Come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here.

1779
01:52:08,789 --> 01:52:09,750
Come here, come here.

1780
01:52:09,750 --> 01:52:10,229
Come here.

1781
01:52:10,229 --> 01:52:10,949
Take this.

1782
01:52:10,949 --> 01:52:15,189
We're good.

1783
01:52:15,640 --> 01:52:17,000
That was actually scary.

1784
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:20,380
Okay.

1785
01:52:22,579 --> 01:52:23,460
What's wrong with them?

1786
01:52:23,460 --> 01:52:27,909
What's wrong with them?

1787
01:52:27,909 --> 01:52:33,060
Is he okay?

1788
01:52:33,060 --> 01:52:33,859
Don't get involved.

1789
01:52:34,420 --> 01:52:35,159
Don't get involved.

1790
01:52:35,159 --> 01:52:35,720
Don't get involved.

1791
01:52:36,279 --> 01:52:37,399
Just clean up.

1792
01:52:37,399 --> 01:52:40,439
Okay.

1793
01:52:40,439 --> 01:52:42,279
I've discovered the little chicks.

1794
01:52:42,279 --> 01:52:50,470
Pick up the logs that you dropped.

1795
01:52:50,470 --> 01:52:52,920
Where did I drop them?

1796
01:52:52,920 --> 01:52:56,380
There's so much bullshit over here.

1797
01:52:56,380 --> 01:53:01,140
Up there, right?

1798
01:53:01,140 --> 01:53:01,779
By the sulfur.

1799
01:53:06,939 --> 01:53:10,539
You could have accepted Assassin's Creed DLC sponsorship.

1800
01:53:13,140 --> 01:53:13,939
Why would I do that?

1801
01:53:16,949 --> 01:53:18,630
Stop healing them, you dummy.

1802
01:53:19,350 --> 01:53:26,180
But instead you took a cool indie sponsor.

1803
01:53:26,180 --> 01:53:26,819
Yeah.

1804
01:53:26,819 --> 01:53:27,619
This game is fun.

1805
01:53:31,020 --> 01:53:32,859
I actually think the game is pretty good.

1806
01:53:32,859 --> 01:53:34,550
It's definitely worth playing.

1807
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:37,579
All right.

1808
01:53:37,579 --> 01:53:38,140
Give me all this.

1809
01:53:38,699 --> 01:53:48,569
Did I already go through 10 potions?

1810
01:53:48,569 --> 01:53:49,210
How did I do that?

1811
01:53:52,520 --> 01:53:53,000
Oh, wait.

1812
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:53,560
I can...

1813
01:53:53,560 --> 01:53:54,199
Can I do this?

1814
01:53:56,149 --> 01:53:56,949
Wait a minute.

1815
01:53:56,949 --> 01:53:57,560
Okay.

1816
01:53:57,560 --> 01:53:57,880
Hold on.

1817
01:53:59,850 --> 01:54:03,449
If I give you a bunch of stuff, you can take it back to town.

1818
01:54:03,449 --> 01:54:04,789
Is it as it works?

1819
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:07,460
Take like all this shit.

1820
01:54:07,460 --> 01:54:08,420
Take like ghoul skin.

1821
01:54:08,420 --> 01:54:09,060
Take the hair.

1822
01:54:09,859 --> 01:54:10,340
Take all this.

1823
01:54:11,140 --> 01:54:11,779
Boon Stone.

1824
01:54:13,989 --> 01:54:14,390
Pump.

1825
01:54:14,390 --> 01:54:14,550
Yeah.

1826
01:54:14,550 --> 01:54:15,750
Just take a bunch of stuff back to town.

1827
01:54:16,310 --> 01:54:22,699
Actually, we got to both go like right now.

1828
01:54:22,699 --> 01:54:26,649
We're good.

1829
01:54:36,949 --> 01:54:37,270
Okay.

1830
01:54:38,760 --> 01:54:39,319
Thank you.

1831
01:54:39,319 --> 01:54:40,520
Appreciate the help.

1832
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:41,239
I'll take everything.

1833
01:54:42,119 --> 01:54:46,329
What's going on?

1834
01:54:46,329 --> 01:54:49,609
Why am I glowing?

1835
01:54:50,170 --> 01:54:55,510
All right.

1836
01:54:55,510 --> 01:54:56,710
We got out in time.

1837
01:54:56,710 --> 01:54:57,399
Okay.

1838
01:54:57,399 --> 01:54:58,920
Ghoul skin, hair.

1839
01:54:58,920 --> 01:55:00,199
I need 15 hairs.

1840
01:55:02,279 --> 01:55:02,600
Shell.

1841
01:55:03,239 --> 01:55:04,569
Okay.

1842
01:55:04,569 --> 01:55:05,689
Shell is five.

1843
01:55:10,680 --> 01:55:12,949
It's five instead of 10.

1844
01:55:12,949 --> 01:55:13,270
Cool.

1845
01:55:18,229 --> 01:55:23,260
So add five vitality is a potion.

1846
01:55:23,260 --> 01:55:25,270
It's a regular healing potion.

1847
01:55:25,270 --> 01:55:26,069
All right.

1848
01:55:26,069 --> 01:55:33,479
The person who said he's acting like he does when he plays multiplayer games is right.

1849
01:55:34,039 --> 01:55:39,739
You want to do a TikTok dance?

1850
01:55:39,739 --> 01:55:40,460
Will that make you happy?

1851
01:55:40,460 --> 01:55:42,300
You want to go do a TikTok dance?

1852
01:55:42,779 --> 01:55:46,979
You want to go put like something like you want to put something in my eyes?

1853
01:55:51,659 --> 01:55:52,619
Should I do a TikTok dance?

1854
01:55:52,619 --> 01:55:53,260
Will that make you happy?

1855
01:55:57,109 --> 01:55:57,510
There you go.

1856
01:55:58,310 --> 01:55:59,850
Slow that down.

1857
01:56:01,930 --> 01:56:03,770
Slow that down to like 0.2.

1858
01:56:04,649 --> 01:56:10,789
All right.

1859
01:56:10,789 --> 01:56:14,119
How are you doing on food?

1860
01:56:14,119 --> 01:56:15,000
Are you hungry?

1861
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:19,510
I think you're hungry.

1862
01:56:20,149 --> 01:56:26,300
Yeah.

1863
01:56:26,300 --> 01:56:31,210
We do eat anything besides just raw meat because that's kind of hard to get.

1864
01:56:31,210 --> 01:56:33,979
Let's see.

1865
01:56:33,979 --> 01:56:34,699
What else do you like?

1866
01:56:37,460 --> 01:56:38,500
Baked meat pie.

1867
01:56:39,300 --> 01:56:41,220
But I only have one baked meat pie.

1868
01:56:42,810 --> 01:56:43,130
All right.

1869
01:56:43,130 --> 01:56:44,090
You can have it.

1870
01:56:44,090 --> 01:56:46,329
Oh, you don't like it.

1871
01:56:46,329 --> 01:56:51,180
Someone slow it down.

1872
01:56:53,430 --> 01:56:54,470
Well, just give me the clip.

1873
01:56:54,470 --> 01:56:55,750
I'll slow it down for you.

1874
01:56:55,750 --> 01:57:01,340
Please do the router turn off joke right now.

1875
01:57:01,340 --> 01:57:02,500
Let me sit.

1876
01:57:02,500 --> 01:57:04,500
Let's watch it right now.

1877
01:57:10,279 --> 01:57:11,399
Will that make you happy?

1878
01:57:11,399 --> 01:57:14,569
You want to go put like something like you want to put something in my eyes?

1879
01:57:23,619 --> 01:57:27,449
Let's take a look.

1880
01:57:31,899 --> 01:57:36,090
Let's see if it looks any good.

1881
01:57:36,090 --> 01:57:36,569
Slow it down.

1882
01:57:37,529 --> 01:57:38,170
Do a TikTok dance.

1883
01:57:38,170 --> 01:57:38,890
Will that make you happy?

1884
01:57:38,890 --> 01:57:40,649
You want to go for a TikTok dance?

1885
01:57:42,869 --> 01:57:45,350
You want to go put like something like you want to put something in my

1886
01:57:50,489 --> 01:57:51,369
Okay, let's see.

1887
01:57:52,659 --> 01:57:55,140
I did it fast so it could be slowed down and enjoyed.

1888
01:57:55,140 --> 01:58:01,909
But that was just a sped up one.

1889
01:58:01,909 --> 01:58:02,710
This is what it actually is.

1890
01:58:10,380 --> 01:58:16,039
And that made me to be a little slower.

1891
01:58:27,609 --> 01:58:28,890
That's fucking terrifying.

1892
01:58:31,109 --> 01:58:32,470
That's fucking scary.

1893
01:58:34,329 --> 01:58:35,609
That's really scary.

1894
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:37,960
What about faster?

1895
01:58:54,090 --> 01:58:56,010
Why do I have such dead eyes?

1896
01:58:56,010 --> 01:58:58,579
Look at how dead my eyes are.

1897
01:59:07,979 --> 01:59:09,739
That's fucking weird.

1898
01:59:09,739 --> 01:59:15,180
I look, my eyes look dead.

1899
01:59:17,689 --> 01:59:20,840
Right?

1900
01:59:20,840 --> 01:59:24,180
I was like, this is weird.

1901
01:59:24,180 --> 01:59:24,899
Psycho eyes.

1902
01:59:32,039 --> 01:59:32,779
Okay.

1903
01:59:38,859 --> 01:59:39,739
How do I make the sword?

1904
01:59:40,380 --> 01:59:42,859
Sword is going to change the whole game here.

1905
01:59:43,579 --> 01:59:49,220
I need it.

1906
01:59:49,220 --> 01:59:49,460
What do I?

1907
01:59:49,460 --> 01:59:50,579
I need a research table.

1908
01:59:50,579 --> 01:59:50,979
Let's go.

1909
01:59:51,939 --> 01:59:52,439
Okay.

1910
01:59:52,439 --> 01:59:53,800
I need to remove.

1911
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:55,960
I need to remove change, right?

1912
01:59:57,770 --> 01:59:59,369
Remove change.

1913
01:59:59,369 --> 02:00:00,250
Can I actually do that?

1914
02:00:02,010 --> 02:00:03,609
Remove change.

1915
02:00:05,640 --> 02:00:06,119
Fuck you.

1916
02:00:07,939 --> 02:00:08,439
What?

1917
02:00:11,640 --> 02:00:12,680
Remove restless.

1918
02:00:13,720 --> 02:00:20,149
Agro the fawn near a tree.

1919
02:00:20,149 --> 02:00:21,029
It'll knock one over.

1920
02:00:21,029 --> 02:00:21,529
Really?

1921
02:00:22,069 --> 02:00:26,939
Good to know.

1922
02:00:26,939 --> 02:00:29,060
How am I doing on a weight?

1923
02:00:29,060 --> 02:00:29,300
Okay.

1924
02:00:29,300 --> 02:00:29,699
I'm fine.

1925
02:00:32,439 --> 02:00:32,920
Hey, hi.

1926
02:00:33,479 --> 02:00:35,239
Why is everybody dead?

1927
02:00:35,880 --> 02:00:39,000
Like, why is everybody dead?

1928
02:00:40,439 --> 02:00:41,239
I'm dead too.

1929
02:00:41,239 --> 02:00:41,800
We're all dead.

1930
02:00:42,359 --> 02:00:43,930
Okay.

1931
02:00:43,930 --> 02:00:45,689
A sword is three scrap and one wood.

1932
02:00:45,689 --> 02:00:46,810
And I really desperately need it.

1933
02:00:46,810 --> 02:00:48,010
I need scrap and I need wood.

1934
02:00:48,569 --> 02:00:48,810
Bad.

1935
02:00:48,810 --> 02:00:49,689
Like, very badly.

1936
02:00:50,250 --> 02:00:51,850
And I don't want to put the dog in danger.

1937
02:00:52,729 --> 02:00:53,930
So I'm going to tell the dog to go home.

1938
02:00:54,569 --> 02:00:55,500
You just go.

1939
02:00:57,159 --> 02:00:59,159
Just like, go wander around and go have fun.

1940
02:00:59,880 --> 02:01:02,060
I'll come back and see you in a minute.

1941
02:01:02,619 --> 02:01:05,029
Be careful though.

1942
02:01:05,029 --> 02:01:05,829
Don't get in any trouble.

1943
02:01:06,390 --> 02:01:12,319
Okay.

1944
02:01:13,899 --> 02:01:14,399
Wood.

1945
02:01:14,859 --> 02:01:16,979
Was that fawn?

1946
02:01:17,539 --> 02:01:22,630
What's the net?

1947
02:01:22,630 --> 02:01:23,989
What do you have for a talking point?

1948
02:01:25,300 --> 02:01:26,340
Um, I don't know.

1949
02:01:27,140 --> 02:01:33,819
I'll take the torch.

1950
02:01:34,460 --> 02:01:37,210
I wish I could just break this down into wood.

1951
02:01:37,770 --> 02:01:42,279
Okay.

1952
02:01:42,739 --> 02:01:45,539
There's a bunch of bullshit up here.

1953
02:01:45,539 --> 02:01:46,260
I can clear it though.

1954
02:01:49,140 --> 02:01:49,460
All right.

1955
02:01:49,460 --> 02:01:49,960
Wood.

1956
02:01:50,260 --> 02:01:53,300
I mean, I have two moonstones, right?

1957
02:01:53,300 --> 02:01:55,140
Do I think I can open that chest for free?

1958
02:01:55,779 --> 02:01:58,699
Isn't there a chest over here?

1959
02:01:59,260 --> 02:02:04,020
I have another moonstone at the back of the house.

1960
02:02:04,659 --> 02:02:09,000
I need three.

1961
02:02:09,979 --> 02:02:11,100
Get some wood, please.

1962
02:02:11,100 --> 02:02:11,659
I'm trying.

1963
02:02:12,460 --> 02:02:18,010
Can I just like go buy somebody and have...

1964
02:02:18,090 --> 02:02:20,329
Go buy a follower and have them go chop wood for me?

1965
02:02:21,130 --> 02:02:23,539
Will they be able to make their own stuff?

1966
02:02:23,539 --> 02:02:29,750
I have 41.

1967
02:02:29,750 --> 02:02:30,250
I'm fine.

1968
02:02:33,640 --> 02:02:34,039
Maybe?

1969
02:02:34,039 --> 02:02:34,680
That's possible.

1970
02:02:35,239 --> 02:02:36,310
I'll give it a try.

1971
02:02:38,899 --> 02:02:39,399
Hide.

1972
02:02:43,180 --> 02:02:45,180
Really?

1973
02:02:45,180 --> 02:02:46,859
Stealth mode allows you to pickpocket.

1974
02:02:47,420 --> 02:02:52,739
But use this cautiously as it'll draw attention to you and blow your cover.

1975
02:02:52,739 --> 02:02:53,939
Oh, I'm just like in a bush.

1976
02:02:53,939 --> 02:02:54,659
That's kind of funny.

1977
02:02:55,220 --> 02:02:58,229
Wait, can I pickpocket this person?

1978
02:03:00,569 --> 02:03:01,369
Bailey.

1979
02:03:01,369 --> 02:03:07,619
How do I do it?

1980
02:03:07,619 --> 02:03:10,949
This person is st...

1981
02:03:10,949 --> 02:03:11,350
What are the...

1982
02:03:11,350 --> 02:03:12,149
Will they have glass?

1983
02:03:12,149 --> 02:03:12,949
How do I pickpocket?

1984
02:03:15,829 --> 02:03:16,329
Steel.

1985
02:03:16,630 --> 02:03:20,260
Oh, I took the glass out of your hand.

1986
02:03:20,819 --> 02:03:23,100
And all the pumpkins you have.

1987
02:03:23,100 --> 02:03:24,140
And a bunch of meat that you had.

1988
02:03:25,289 --> 02:03:25,789
Okay.

1989
02:03:26,329 --> 02:03:36,170
Okay.

1990
02:03:36,170 --> 02:03:40,789
All right.

1991
02:03:40,789 --> 02:03:41,590
Try a follower?

1992
02:03:43,859 --> 02:03:44,500
What am I doing?

1993
02:03:45,220 --> 02:03:45,779
Bro, what?

1994
02:03:45,779 --> 02:03:46,279
What?

1995
02:03:48,140 --> 02:03:49,020
They're corrupted.

1996
02:03:49,020 --> 02:03:50,060
They're like zombies.

1997
02:03:50,060 --> 02:03:51,020
I have to get rid of them.

1998
02:03:51,020 --> 02:04:00,840
All right.

1999
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:02,279
Let me try that thing with that person over at the fawn.

2000
02:04:06,380 --> 02:04:08,939
What happened to the big boss thing that was over here?

2001
02:04:08,939 --> 02:04:09,739
It's not here anymore.

2002
02:04:10,300 --> 02:04:11,750
I haven't seen it.

2003
02:04:12,310 --> 02:04:20,420
It's up in the northwest.

2004
02:04:20,979 --> 02:04:21,460
All right.

2005
02:04:21,460 --> 02:04:22,340
I want to see if I can get the...

2006
02:04:22,340 --> 02:04:23,460
The person said get a fawn.

2007
02:04:24,260 --> 02:04:27,420
If I get a fawn, then I can have them knock a tree over, right?

2008
02:04:28,140 --> 02:04:30,470
Claw amulet.

2009
02:04:32,170 --> 02:04:32,890
Cool.

2010
02:04:32,890 --> 02:04:39,270
Oh, what's that?

2011
02:04:39,270 --> 02:04:40,399
That's new.

2012
02:04:41,020 --> 02:04:49,449
Raw meat.

2013
02:04:49,449 --> 02:04:49,770
Good.

2014
02:04:49,770 --> 02:04:50,270
It's ore.

2015
02:04:50,970 --> 02:04:55,289
I'm fine.

2016
02:04:55,289 --> 02:04:56,090
I need that fawn.

2017
02:04:56,729 --> 02:04:58,739
Don't worry, guys.

2018
02:04:58,739 --> 02:05:00,579
He's doing the softlock route on purpose.

2019
02:05:04,039 --> 02:05:05,560
This is not the softlock route.

2020
02:05:05,560 --> 02:05:06,520
Why does this run heavenly?

2021
02:05:07,239 --> 02:05:07,979
All right.

2022
02:05:07,979 --> 02:05:09,659
Come with me and I want you to break some stuff for me.

2023
02:05:10,220 --> 02:05:13,449
Can I like talk to this guy?

2024
02:05:14,170 --> 02:05:18,229
Okay.

2025
02:05:18,229 --> 02:05:21,510
So you're saying walk the fawn over to a tree and he will destroy it.

2026
02:05:22,149 --> 02:05:25,029
I didn't get softlocked.

2027
02:05:25,029 --> 02:05:25,430
I'm fine.

2028
02:05:25,989 --> 02:05:27,640
All right.

2029
02:05:27,640 --> 02:05:28,199
Come down here.

2030
02:05:28,920 --> 02:05:31,420
All right.

2031
02:05:31,420 --> 02:05:32,380
Come break this.

2032
02:05:32,380 --> 02:05:33,420
Just so I don't get softlocked.

2033
02:05:33,899 --> 02:05:39,430
It's the moonstone effect.

2034
02:05:40,550 --> 02:05:40,789
All right.

2035
02:05:40,789 --> 02:05:41,109
Come on.

2036
02:05:41,109 --> 02:05:41,350
Move.

2037
02:05:41,989 --> 02:05:43,819
I have to punch him.

2038
02:05:49,369 --> 02:05:51,050
That chicken just ran into the pole and died.

2039
02:05:51,930 --> 02:05:53,640
All right.

2040
02:05:53,640 --> 02:05:54,680
Knock this stuff down.

2041
02:06:01,079 --> 02:06:01,640
Did it work?

2042
02:06:05,979 --> 02:06:06,460
It worked.

2043
02:06:06,460 --> 02:06:06,859
Holy shit.

2044
02:06:06,859 --> 02:06:07,420
They were right.

2045
02:06:08,779 --> 02:06:09,500
Oh, my God.

2046
02:06:09,500 --> 02:06:10,619
You actually weren't kidding.

2047
02:06:11,260 --> 02:06:13,779
All right.

2048
02:06:13,779 --> 02:06:14,340
Get this one, too.

2049
02:06:14,899 --> 02:06:16,420
I need like 10 at least.

2050
02:06:21,939 --> 02:06:23,060
Don't kill your own stuff.

2051
02:06:23,779 --> 02:06:27,420
Do the big AOE.

2052
02:06:28,300 --> 02:06:31,079
Break it.

2053
02:06:31,720 --> 02:06:33,939
All right.

2054
02:06:33,939 --> 02:06:34,819
That's like two more.

2055
02:06:35,619 --> 02:06:36,840
Get away from me.

2056
02:06:36,840 --> 02:06:39,180
Okay.

2057
02:06:39,180 --> 02:06:40,460
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right.

2058
02:06:40,460 --> 02:06:41,100
This one over here.

2059
02:06:41,659 --> 02:06:43,340
It's 80 percent.

2060
02:06:43,340 --> 02:06:43,579
I'm good.

2061
02:06:44,220 --> 02:06:50,390
I bet you'd get something crazy if you kill this thing.

2062
02:06:50,949 --> 02:06:53,939
Just come take all the trees down

2063
02:06:54,500 --> 02:06:56,810
so I can come here with a sword and an axe.

2064
02:06:56,810 --> 02:07:00,329
You still chasing me?

2065
02:07:00,970 --> 02:07:05,340
Killed the chicken, too.

2066
02:07:05,340 --> 02:07:07,420
No, that would be poisoned.

2067
02:07:10,890 --> 02:07:11,130
All right.

2068
02:07:11,130 --> 02:07:12,569
Just knock these down and I'm out of here.

2069
02:07:13,130 --> 02:07:15,100
I'll leave after you do this.

2070
02:07:15,100 --> 02:07:15,579
I promise.

2071
02:07:16,140 --> 02:07:20,729
I'm not going to kill the chicken for no reason.

2072
02:07:21,449 --> 02:07:22,949
All right.

2073
02:07:22,949 --> 02:07:23,430
This one, too.

2074
02:07:24,149 --> 02:07:25,619
Thank you.

2075
02:07:29,079 --> 02:07:30,680
Just kicked me in the fucking face.

2076
02:07:31,880 --> 02:07:33,319
Don't die to this.

2077
02:07:33,319 --> 02:07:33,800
Come on.

2078
02:07:34,600 --> 02:07:38,420
Do I have any healing potions left?

2079
02:07:42,220 --> 02:07:42,859
Why is he so?

2080
02:07:42,859 --> 02:07:43,819
Why are you so much faster now?

2081
02:07:44,760 --> 02:07:46,760
This guy is a thousand miles per hour now.

2082
02:07:46,760 --> 02:07:47,640
Just kick this, please.

2083
02:07:51,770 --> 02:07:52,010
All right.

2084
02:07:52,010 --> 02:07:52,409
Fuck off.

2085
02:07:52,409 --> 02:07:52,810
Goodbye.

2086
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,939
Goodbye.

2087
02:07:59,939 --> 02:08:07,369
Now I can make some stuff.

2088
02:08:07,369 --> 02:08:07,689
All right.

2089
02:08:07,689 --> 02:08:11,850
I need damage plus healing plus rejuvenation, aging, healing.

2090
02:08:11,850 --> 02:08:12,409
I can do that.

2091
02:08:13,130 --> 02:08:14,250
I can do this one.

2092
02:08:15,750 --> 02:08:15,989
Yep.

2093
02:08:16,550 --> 02:08:17,270
Okay.

2094
02:08:17,270 --> 02:08:17,829
Take the money.

2095
02:08:17,829 --> 02:08:18,149
Thank you.

2096
02:08:21,850 --> 02:08:22,170
Okay.

2097
02:08:23,220 --> 02:08:23,539
All right.

2098
02:08:24,180 --> 02:08:33,210
How much more do I need?

2099
02:08:33,210 --> 02:08:33,850
I got this new thing.

2100
02:08:34,649 --> 02:08:35,130
Thorner.

2101
02:08:36,010 --> 02:08:40,619
It's fun just to go pick up the stuff and then put it in here.

2102
02:08:43,659 --> 02:08:43,899
Okay.

2103
02:08:45,340 --> 02:08:45,979
I need.

2104
02:08:48,819 --> 02:08:50,899
So let's take this.

2105
02:08:51,619 --> 02:08:53,460
I will make charcoal, right?

2106
02:08:53,460 --> 02:08:53,859
Won't I?

2107
02:08:54,420 --> 02:09:00,279
I'm going to make some steak for my friend.

2108
02:09:01,640 --> 02:09:02,199
Yep.

2109
02:09:02,199 --> 02:09:03,399
Cooking gives you charcoal.

2110
02:09:05,979 --> 02:09:06,300
Okay.

2111
02:09:06,859 --> 02:09:11,130
Let me go feed my friend.

2112
02:09:14,680 --> 02:09:16,840
It's a calm game with an ice streamer.

2113
02:09:19,319 --> 02:09:21,829
Yeah, this is I can give you my thoughts.

2114
02:09:22,390 --> 02:09:29,739
It seems elaborate enough and it seems big enough.

2115
02:09:30,460 --> 02:09:34,789
I don't know how much bigger the world is, but I'm assuming there's probably more like

2116
02:09:34,789 --> 02:09:35,430
all the way up here.

2117
02:09:35,989 --> 02:09:40,220
It seems cute.

2118
02:09:40,220 --> 02:09:40,619
It's fun.

2119
02:09:41,180 --> 02:09:42,779
I think I actually think it's good.

2120
02:09:46,220 --> 02:09:49,020
I don't think I'm too pea brained to enjoy this either.

2121
02:09:49,020 --> 02:09:51,020
I think it's just enough for me to understand.

2122
02:09:54,890 --> 02:09:55,529
All right.

2123
02:09:55,529 --> 02:09:56,409
This might be stupid.

2124
02:09:56,409 --> 02:09:56,890
I'm going to do it.

2125
02:10:15,770 --> 02:10:16,329
Contain.

2126
02:10:20,630 --> 02:10:23,800
Oh, that's what I was supposed to do.

2127
02:10:24,779 --> 02:10:25,579
Oh my goodness.

2128
02:10:25,579 --> 02:10:26,140
It's a vessel.

2129
02:10:29,050 --> 02:10:30,810
I need a human follower to pick this up.

2130
02:10:30,810 --> 02:10:31,529
What?

2131
02:10:31,529 --> 02:10:31,770
How?

2132
02:10:32,649 --> 02:10:33,449
Okay.

2133
02:10:33,449 --> 02:10:33,770
All right.

2134
02:10:33,770 --> 02:10:34,170
Slow down.

2135
02:10:34,810 --> 02:10:35,369
I need to go.

2136
02:10:35,930 --> 02:10:36,649
Oh, shit.

2137
02:10:36,649 --> 02:10:36,970
All right.

2138
02:10:37,689 --> 02:10:40,539
That's what you have to do.

2139
02:10:40,539 --> 02:10:43,399
That's the money sink.

2140
02:10:43,399 --> 02:10:44,199
All right.

2141
02:10:44,199 --> 02:10:45,659
How much is it for?

2142
02:10:46,699 --> 02:10:47,579
That doesn't disappear, right?

2143
02:10:48,390 --> 02:10:54,260
Hope not.

2144
02:10:54,260 --> 02:10:55,060
How much does it cost?

2145
02:10:58,250 --> 02:10:58,729
I wonder.

2146
02:10:59,449 --> 02:11:01,859
I love I keep asking you guys as if you guys are going to know.

2147
02:11:03,060 --> 02:11:03,539
Maybe you do.

2148
02:11:03,539 --> 02:11:04,500
Maybe you guys have already played it.

2149
02:11:05,460 --> 02:11:12,619
So the boat, the boats here and I need a follower.

2150
02:11:13,180 --> 02:11:17,909
I need a follower to go pick that thing up.

2151
02:11:18,470 --> 02:11:21,239
Cooking recipe.

2152
02:11:21,880 --> 02:11:32,569
Guys, this is smoked fish pasty.

2153
02:11:35,539 --> 02:11:36,020
All right.

2154
02:11:36,020 --> 02:11:36,979
I'm just going to hang on here for a second.

2155
02:11:38,470 --> 02:11:39,430
Explore the map more.

2156
02:11:40,630 --> 02:11:43,670
I have to do this first part here.

2157
02:11:43,670 --> 02:11:47,670
I can't go up or I don't think I can go anywhere until I do that first little tutorial zone.

2158
02:11:48,470 --> 02:11:51,109
What's the downside to being restless?

2159
02:11:51,909 --> 02:11:53,750
You don't have stamina and you deal more damage.

2160
02:11:54,390 --> 02:11:56,539
Yeah, I actually don't know.

2161
02:11:56,539 --> 02:11:57,899
I think it's no stamina.

2162
02:11:57,899 --> 02:11:58,779
So no sprinting.

2163
02:11:59,899 --> 02:12:00,779
No hunger.

2164
02:12:00,779 --> 02:12:01,899
I'm sure I can look it up, right?

2165
02:12:01,899 --> 02:12:02,300
Let's see.

2166
02:12:03,260 --> 02:12:07,640
Human.

2167
02:12:07,640 --> 02:12:08,600
That's what that is, right?

2168
02:12:14,890 --> 02:12:16,810
Human with that immunity.

2169
02:12:17,529 --> 02:12:19,529
35 health, five attack.

2170
02:12:20,329 --> 02:12:21,529
No food and don't age.

2171
02:12:25,449 --> 02:12:28,489
Versus two attack, one attack.

2172
02:12:28,489 --> 02:12:29,289
What's the green mean?

2173
02:12:31,619 --> 02:12:33,430
All right, here we go.

2174
02:12:34,069 --> 02:12:34,869
I need a follower.

2175
02:12:35,590 --> 02:12:44,649
Come on, come on, come on.

2176
02:12:47,029 --> 02:12:49,270
Ratio plus L plus you're a skeleton.

2177
02:12:50,899 --> 02:12:53,300
No maidens plus no followers plus L plus ratio.

2178
02:13:00,420 --> 02:13:01,220
Oh my God.

2179
02:13:01,220 --> 02:13:02,020
Fucking pull in.

2180
02:13:07,340 --> 02:13:07,979
Where are you?

2181
02:13:07,979 --> 02:13:08,859
There we go.

2182
02:13:08,859 --> 02:13:09,739
All right.

2183
02:13:09,739 --> 02:13:10,239
Who's here?

2184
02:13:11,100 --> 02:13:18,069
Fish spawn.

2185
02:13:18,069 --> 02:13:20,939
Okay.

2186
02:13:21,020 --> 02:13:21,500
What else?

2187
02:13:22,779 --> 02:13:28,060
Well, there's a book.

2188
02:13:28,060 --> 02:13:33,689
Is anybody on the boat?

2189
02:13:35,380 --> 02:13:36,180
The boat's empty.

2190
02:13:37,060 --> 02:13:42,680
Are they on the side?

2191
02:13:42,680 --> 02:13:44,119
Wait, maybe I just talked to one.

2192
02:13:45,079 --> 02:13:46,949
Oh, the fog.

2193
02:13:46,949 --> 02:13:48,310
Make me peer so pretty.

2194
02:13:48,310 --> 02:13:50,630
You can hardly see the misery in them.

2195
02:13:51,270 --> 02:13:53,659
Oh, okay.

2196
02:13:53,659 --> 02:13:55,420
Oh, you guys have only eight bucks.

2197
02:13:58,680 --> 02:14:04,420
Oh, 12 health, 25 stamina.

2198
02:14:04,420 --> 02:14:06,420
You got a hair, a torch, and a pumpkin.

2199
02:14:07,140 --> 02:14:07,619
All right, dude.

2200
02:14:07,619 --> 02:14:08,180
I don't know about you.

2201
02:14:08,979 --> 02:14:11,720
Clement, three.

2202
02:14:11,720 --> 02:14:12,840
This is a kid.

2203
02:14:12,840 --> 02:14:14,439
This is like a fucking five-year-old.

2204
02:14:20,819 --> 02:14:22,020
Okay, Julie, 10.

2205
02:14:22,979 --> 02:14:24,260
You got metal scrap on you too.

2206
02:14:24,819 --> 02:14:26,170
I wish I had 84.

2207
02:14:26,970 --> 02:14:28,300
All right.

2208
02:14:30,300 --> 02:14:33,060
How many people can I hire?

2209
02:14:33,060 --> 02:14:37,350
Just take them all.

2210
02:14:37,350 --> 02:14:41,689
Okay, come with me.

2211
02:14:43,189 --> 02:14:45,109
All right, nobody walk off the edge, please.

2212
02:14:46,460 --> 02:14:48,699
Okay, I need somebody to pick up this thing over here.

2213
02:14:52,340 --> 02:14:53,619
You can go with a whole party?

2214
02:14:53,619 --> 02:14:54,579
That's actually kind of funny.

2215
02:14:55,300 --> 02:14:56,260
How many people can you have?

2216
02:14:56,260 --> 02:15:02,359
Okay, so we're going to go.

2217
02:15:03,720 --> 02:15:05,479
Let's make sure everyone's equipped.

2218
02:15:11,859 --> 02:15:12,899
Don't step on anything.

2219
02:15:12,899 --> 02:15:13,380
Be careful.

2220
02:15:14,180 --> 02:15:15,619
You should light your torch over here.

2221
02:15:18,739 --> 02:15:19,779
Hey, give me the thing.

2222
02:15:20,420 --> 02:15:22,340
I'll light it for you and hand it back to you.

2223
02:15:22,979 --> 02:15:30,659
How do I want to light this?

2224
02:15:31,300 --> 02:15:33,100
What's wrong with me?

2225
02:15:38,069 --> 02:15:38,550
Oh, whatever.

2226
02:15:38,550 --> 02:15:38,949
I don't care.

2227
02:15:38,949 --> 02:15:39,350
Just take it.

2228
02:15:40,069 --> 02:15:41,779
Okay, let's go.

2229
02:15:42,340 --> 02:15:48,300
Can I have them like collect berries and shit?

2230
02:15:48,859 --> 02:15:50,250
Do you pick berries up?

2231
02:15:52,869 --> 02:15:55,109
Inspect, wait, wander, play.

2232
02:15:57,300 --> 02:15:57,859
Wait, what?

2233
02:15:58,340 --> 02:15:58,819
Come with me.

2234
02:15:59,619 --> 02:16:01,210
I need somebody to pick this up

2235
02:16:01,210 --> 02:16:03,529
and I need you to put it down on the corrupted area.

2236
02:16:08,039 --> 02:16:12,600
Follow me.

2237
02:16:12,600 --> 02:16:15,060
Wait, who should pick it up?

2238
02:16:15,779 --> 02:16:16,819
Should I have the kid pick it up?

2239
02:16:18,199 --> 02:16:19,880
This chat is so fucking funny.

2240
02:16:20,600 --> 02:16:21,800
Yeah, they're fun.

2241
02:16:22,359 --> 02:16:24,920
Okay, pick it up.

2242
02:16:25,989 --> 02:16:26,710
Get it.

2243
02:16:26,710 --> 02:16:27,430
Now bring it with me.

2244
02:16:29,750 --> 02:16:30,710
This kid is so slow.

2245
02:16:30,710 --> 02:16:31,430
Who's this kid?

2246
02:16:35,850 --> 02:16:37,930
All right, we just need to bring this over to the thing

2247
02:16:37,930 --> 02:16:44,899
and put it down and I heal the tree.

2248
02:16:44,899 --> 02:16:45,620
Problem solved.

2249
02:16:46,260 --> 02:16:57,799
Don't drop that.

2250
02:16:58,360 --> 02:17:05,989
Keep going.

2251
02:17:07,500 --> 02:17:08,299
All right, put it right here.

2252
02:17:11,500 --> 02:17:11,899
Right here.

2253
02:17:13,399 --> 02:17:14,200
Drop it.

2254
02:17:14,200 --> 02:17:14,680
Put it down.

2255
02:17:20,200 --> 02:17:20,440
Okay.

2256
02:17:25,180 --> 02:17:26,780
No, put it down right here.

2257
02:17:26,780 --> 02:17:28,819
Put it down right here.

2258
02:17:28,819 --> 02:17:29,379
Put it down.

2259
02:17:30,180 --> 02:17:32,569
All right, now what?

2260
02:17:35,370 --> 02:17:36,409
Do I have to break it?

2261
02:17:36,409 --> 02:17:39,139
Oh god, what's happening?

2262
02:17:39,139 --> 02:17:42,739
Is it working?

2263
02:17:42,739 --> 02:17:45,559
I think it's working.

2264
02:17:46,620 --> 02:17:47,260
Is this working?

2265
02:17:47,899 --> 02:17:53,000
Should I break it?

2266
02:18:02,520 --> 02:18:02,840
Fuck.

2267
02:18:07,750 --> 02:18:08,709
No, get out of here.

2268
02:18:08,709 --> 02:18:09,430
Get out of the way.

2269
02:18:10,170 --> 02:18:11,450
Get out of the way.

2270
02:18:11,450 --> 02:18:12,010
What happened?

2271
02:18:13,450 --> 02:18:14,170
Why is it not?

2272
02:18:14,809 --> 02:18:15,610
What did it turn into?

2273
02:18:15,610 --> 02:18:16,329
Purifying?

2274
02:18:17,540 --> 02:18:18,579
It purifies to...

2275
02:18:20,629 --> 02:18:21,430
What the fuck?

2276
02:18:24,260 --> 02:18:25,299
I put it on the X.

2277
02:18:27,370 --> 02:18:28,649
No, I'm not soft-locked.

2278
02:18:28,649 --> 02:18:29,690
I'm fine.

2279
02:18:29,690 --> 02:18:30,569
I'm gonna be fine.

2280
02:18:30,569 --> 02:18:31,129
Don't worry.

2281
02:18:31,129 --> 02:18:31,690
I'm fine.

2282
02:18:33,260 --> 02:18:33,659
What?

2283
02:18:33,659 --> 02:18:34,620
Why did I break it?

2284
02:18:34,620 --> 02:18:35,180
I broke it.

2285
02:18:35,819 --> 02:18:40,280
We're gonna get out of here.

2286
02:18:40,280 --> 02:18:41,719
Bring sanctum to the cursed tree.

2287
02:18:41,719 --> 02:18:42,760
Didn't I do that?

2288
02:18:42,760 --> 02:18:45,879
Okay.

2289
02:18:45,879 --> 02:18:47,559
Where's that fucking huge thing?

2290
02:18:48,200 --> 02:18:52,469
I didn't place it on the X.

2291
02:18:52,469 --> 02:18:53,590
I mean, I put it right on the X.

2292
02:18:59,829 --> 02:19:00,149
All right.

2293
02:19:00,149 --> 02:19:00,709
Why don't you just...

2294
02:19:01,350 --> 02:19:01,590
Here.

2295
02:19:02,790 --> 02:19:03,190
Just...

2296
02:19:03,190 --> 02:19:04,389
Why don't you just fucking take this?

2297
02:19:04,950 --> 02:19:07,190
Turn into a fucking chicken for all I care.

2298
02:19:07,190 --> 02:19:08,229
I need to get rid of stuff.

2299
02:19:10,329 --> 02:19:11,290
I can't even eat this.

2300
02:19:11,290 --> 02:19:11,530
All right.

2301
02:19:11,530 --> 02:19:12,090
I'm almost there.

2302
02:19:12,889 --> 02:19:15,610
All right.

2303
02:19:15,610 --> 02:19:15,930
We're good.

2304
02:19:19,639 --> 02:19:20,360
Just go home.

2305
02:19:20,360 --> 02:19:21,000
Go back to the camp.

2306
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:21,639
We'll talk later.

2307
02:19:28,780 --> 02:19:29,260
No, no, no, no.

2308
02:19:29,260 --> 02:19:29,500
Don't fight.

2309
02:19:29,500 --> 02:19:29,819
Don't fight.

2310
02:19:29,819 --> 02:19:30,139
Don't fight.

2311
02:19:30,139 --> 02:19:30,459
Just leave.

2312
02:19:31,100 --> 02:19:35,510
So was that not what I was supposed to do?

2313
02:19:36,149 --> 02:19:38,629
I mean, it was like put the vessel on the X.

2314
02:19:38,629 --> 02:19:39,989
I put it on the X and I didn't do anything.

2315
02:19:40,709 --> 02:19:43,479
What happened?

2316
02:19:43,479 --> 02:19:51,030
You dropped it?

2317
02:19:51,030 --> 02:19:51,750
You didn't put it.

2318
02:19:59,879 --> 02:20:00,840
I almost did it.

2319
02:20:01,399 --> 02:20:03,020
Oh, well.

2320
02:20:03,579 --> 02:20:05,850
Can I learn anything about these?

2321
02:20:06,649 --> 02:20:14,540
Okay.

2322
02:20:14,540 --> 02:20:15,100
Here.

2323
02:20:15,100 --> 02:20:18,329
Okay.

2324
02:20:18,329 --> 02:20:19,690
I'm going to give you some potions.

2325
02:20:20,329 --> 02:20:21,700
Makes sense.

2326
02:20:22,340 --> 02:20:24,440
And take some fucking eggs and stuff, too.

2327
02:20:24,440 --> 02:20:25,159
You can't have the stick.

2328
02:20:25,159 --> 02:20:25,719
That's for the dog.

2329
02:20:26,280 --> 02:20:30,680
I'm keeping the beef and eggs.

2330
02:20:32,729 --> 02:20:37,559
Okay.

2331
02:20:37,559 --> 02:20:40,360
So I needed a hundred more coins to get another one of those vessels.

2332
02:20:40,360 --> 02:20:46,440
So you're saying I needed to place it instead of put it.

2333
02:20:46,440 --> 02:20:47,510
Is that what you're saying?

2334
02:20:48,229 --> 02:20:56,149
There was a put command, but I dropped it.

2335
02:20:56,149 --> 02:21:01,159
I feel like I pressed it.

2336
02:21:01,159 --> 02:21:01,959
How much money do I have?

2337
02:21:02,760 --> 02:21:03,370
All right.

2338
02:21:03,370 --> 02:21:04,329
I just need to sell some shit.

2339
02:21:05,209 --> 02:21:06,889
I have enough potions to sell stuff.

2340
02:21:07,770 --> 02:21:10,920
Hold the button like when you gather.

2341
02:21:17,659 --> 02:21:22,329
I think there's some quest to turn it over here.

2342
02:21:22,329 --> 02:21:22,649
Okay.

2343
02:21:22,649 --> 02:21:28,040
I have aging.

2344
02:21:28,040 --> 02:21:29,319
I don't have any aging, do I?

2345
02:21:29,319 --> 02:21:29,559
No.

2346
02:21:30,809 --> 02:21:32,010
Hey, you know the things I just gave you?

2347
02:21:32,010 --> 02:21:32,489
Give them back.

2348
02:21:33,129 --> 02:21:33,899
Thank you.

2349
02:21:37,290 --> 02:21:38,649
Healing plus, right?

2350
02:21:38,649 --> 02:21:39,450
Oh, it's healing.

2351
02:21:39,450 --> 02:21:40,649
I have healing plus plus.

2352
02:21:43,850 --> 02:21:44,809
Don't I have a bunch of these?

2353
02:21:47,690 --> 02:21:48,969
That was a funny joke.

2354
02:21:48,969 --> 02:21:49,690
I mean, I thought I was.

2355
02:21:49,690 --> 02:21:50,569
I thought I put it down.

2356
02:21:51,129 --> 02:21:56,299
Okay.

2357
02:21:56,299 --> 02:22:02,010
I need I could equate add age.

2358
02:22:04,389 --> 02:22:05,270
Add age.

2359
02:22:06,579 --> 02:22:07,700
That's an age potion, right?

2360
02:22:10,500 --> 02:22:10,819
Really?

2361
02:22:11,780 --> 02:22:16,020
Add this.

2362
02:22:16,739 --> 02:22:18,950
What?

2363
02:22:20,149 --> 02:22:21,579
What are you talking about?

2364
02:22:21,579 --> 02:22:22,860
Add vitality, right?

2365
02:22:23,420 --> 02:22:24,260
Yeah, that's it.

2366
02:22:24,260 --> 02:22:25,139
Isn't that what I just did?

2367
02:22:33,399 --> 02:22:34,360
Wait, if I can I?

2368
02:22:35,079 --> 02:22:36,219
Okay, hold on.

2369
02:22:36,219 --> 02:22:36,940
Let me turn this on.

2370
02:22:36,940 --> 02:22:39,379
Okay.

2371
02:22:39,379 --> 02:22:40,579
How much money do I have?

2372
02:22:40,579 --> 02:22:45,290
23 damage plus healing plus is done.

2373
02:22:47,500 --> 02:22:48,299
Regular healing.

2374
02:22:49,860 --> 02:22:50,340
All right.

2375
02:22:50,340 --> 02:22:52,420
Aging and then aging plus.

2376
02:22:53,219 --> 02:22:55,059
All right.

2377
02:22:55,059 --> 02:22:56,899
I need to do add and then 10.

2378
02:22:57,620 --> 02:22:58,260
Okay.

2379
02:22:58,260 --> 02:23:00,329
I think I can do it.

2380
02:23:00,969 --> 02:23:04,600
Can you get a cake pop?

2381
02:23:05,399 --> 02:23:10,780
Okay.

2382
02:23:10,780 --> 02:23:11,260
Add.

2383
02:23:11,260 --> 02:23:12,540
I don't have the materials for it.

2384
02:23:13,899 --> 02:23:16,629
Did I stash them?

2385
02:23:17,350 --> 02:23:20,659
No, I did not.

2386
02:23:20,659 --> 02:23:21,219
All right.

2387
02:23:21,219 --> 02:23:22,260
I have 38.

2388
02:23:23,850 --> 02:23:24,489
But here's the thing.

2389
02:23:24,489 --> 02:23:27,690
I think I can use those potions on the big scary raven thing.

2390
02:23:31,129 --> 02:23:31,930
Purifying, right?

2391
02:23:32,739 --> 02:23:33,459
Will that work?

2392
02:23:34,020 --> 02:23:35,379
Maybe I should try to use this on some stuff.

2393
02:23:48,409 --> 02:23:49,129
Oh, yeah.

2394
02:23:49,129 --> 02:23:49,930
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2395
02:23:49,930 --> 02:23:50,409
This might work.

2396
02:23:50,969 --> 02:23:53,459
Can I actually get in here?

2397
02:23:53,459 --> 02:23:56,709
That's a good idea.

2398
02:23:57,270 --> 02:23:58,379
That's right.

2399
02:23:59,780 --> 02:24:00,659
Oh, all right.

2400
02:24:00,659 --> 02:24:00,899
Nice.

2401
02:24:00,899 --> 02:24:01,700
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

2402
02:24:01,700 --> 02:24:02,260
Go, go, go, go, go.

2403
02:24:02,260 --> 02:24:02,739
What's in here?

2404
02:24:06,280 --> 02:24:07,079
Adderstone?

2405
02:24:07,799 --> 02:24:08,920
Wait, what's this little guy?

2406
02:24:10,219 --> 02:24:12,379
Wait, stop.

2407
02:24:13,180 --> 02:24:16,309
Wait, get over here.

2408
02:24:18,809 --> 02:24:19,690
What's wrong with this guy?

2409
02:24:20,329 --> 02:24:24,889
He's just going to leave.

2410
02:24:25,610 --> 02:24:27,049
Okay.

2411
02:24:27,049 --> 02:24:28,010
Well, I got an adderstone.

2412
02:24:28,010 --> 02:24:29,290
I wonder what that is.

2413
02:24:29,290 --> 02:24:35,620
What else is in here?

2414
02:24:38,260 --> 02:24:39,059
Sword recipe.

2415
02:24:40,260 --> 02:24:40,579
Run.

2416
02:24:46,790 --> 02:24:49,989
An ordinary house that can be used for sweeping out dust and uninvited guests.

2417
02:24:49,989 --> 02:24:50,629
So it's just kind of a...

2418
02:24:51,350 --> 02:24:52,729
What does it do?

2419
02:24:53,530 --> 02:24:59,180
Do you want this thing?

2420
02:24:59,739 --> 02:25:01,959
I think that's a smelter.

2421
02:25:05,659 --> 02:25:06,780
What is this thing?

2422
02:25:06,780 --> 02:25:18,139
All right.

2423
02:25:18,139 --> 02:25:18,540
I have so much.

2424
02:25:18,540 --> 02:25:19,340
I'm going to store the glass.

2425
02:25:20,299 --> 02:25:29,180
Watching Jerma play this cured my hemorrhoids.

2426
02:25:29,180 --> 02:25:30,059
That's good.

2427
02:25:30,059 --> 02:25:33,610
All right.

2428
02:25:33,610 --> 02:25:34,329
I got metal scrap.

2429
02:25:43,399 --> 02:25:44,360
Come on.

2430
02:25:44,360 --> 02:25:45,479
Just get up the stairs.

2431
02:25:46,440 --> 02:25:47,879
You know you can get there.

2432
02:25:47,879 --> 02:25:53,540
I'll get there.

2433
02:25:53,540 --> 02:25:54,420
I'll get there soon.

2434
02:25:54,420 --> 02:25:55,219
Don't worry.

2435
02:25:55,219 --> 02:25:55,620
I'm there.

2436
02:25:56,340 --> 02:26:06,459
That's a I shit my pants walk if I've ever seen it.

2437
02:26:06,459 --> 02:26:08,780
I mean, I'm just like a thing of bones.

2438
02:26:08,780 --> 02:26:09,979
I'm like a bag of bones.

2439
02:26:10,700 --> 02:26:12,709
I need to get 15 of these.

2440
02:26:13,430 --> 02:26:21,219
Okay.

2441
02:26:21,219 --> 02:26:26,200
Store some of this stuff because I don't need like all this glass.

2442
02:26:28,440 --> 02:26:29,239
Inventory full.

2443
02:26:29,239 --> 02:26:29,399
Yeah.

2444
02:26:29,399 --> 02:26:29,879
Put it away.

2445
02:26:35,399 --> 02:26:38,069
You can't take any more.

2446
02:26:38,069 --> 02:26:38,870
I'm trying to put it away.

2447
02:26:39,909 --> 02:26:41,899
How do I put it away?

2448
02:26:41,899 --> 02:26:42,459
Put wait.

2449
02:26:44,540 --> 02:26:44,780
Huh?

2450
02:26:45,500 --> 02:26:46,620
Can I not put the glass away?

2451
02:26:47,500 --> 02:26:53,750
I'm going to go make an axe.

2452
02:26:54,309 --> 02:26:56,760
I think I can make a sword now.

2453
02:27:05,829 --> 02:27:06,309
Okay.

2454
02:27:06,309 --> 02:27:07,659
Let me make an axe.

2455
02:27:11,399 --> 02:27:13,000
But my hemorrhoids are still there.

2456
02:27:19,159 --> 02:27:19,559
Hey, you.

2457
02:27:22,549 --> 02:27:23,430
Wait, you're not my friend.

2458
02:27:24,540 --> 02:27:24,940
Fuck off.

2459
02:27:25,500 --> 02:27:34,420
Okay.

2460
02:27:34,420 --> 02:27:36,020
I'm I still got money.

2461
02:27:36,020 --> 02:27:39,500
I'm going to try to cure.

2462
02:27:39,500 --> 02:27:40,540
I want to purify that thing.

2463
02:27:42,170 --> 02:27:42,969
The scary thing.

2464
02:27:45,540 --> 02:27:45,860
Okay.

2465
02:27:46,500 --> 02:27:47,059
Stag.

2466
02:27:48,020 --> 02:27:48,340
Axe.

2467
02:27:48,899 --> 02:27:49,459
Pick lock.

2468
02:27:49,459 --> 02:27:50,260
I want one of these.

2469
02:27:53,049 --> 02:27:53,930
I want an axe.

2470
02:27:54,809 --> 02:27:55,850
And I want a pick lock.

2471
02:27:56,409 --> 02:27:57,770
But I only I can't do two.

2472
02:27:58,569 --> 02:27:59,530
What's this?

2473
02:27:59,530 --> 02:28:00,569
What is a stag?

2474
02:28:00,569 --> 02:28:04,100
It's like you pick up hot coals with.

2475
02:28:04,100 --> 02:28:04,500
What is that?

2476
02:28:05,059 --> 02:28:13,379
Well, I need an axe.

2477
02:28:13,379 --> 02:28:14,420
I'm not going to make it.

2478
02:28:14,420 --> 02:28:18,469
Can I just make two?

2479
02:28:19,030 --> 02:28:21,340
Maybe I should make a stag.

2480
02:28:21,340 --> 02:28:22,299
I don't know what it does.

2481
02:28:22,299 --> 02:28:23,579
Remove three vitality.

2482
02:28:23,579 --> 02:28:23,899
That's it.

2483
02:28:28,889 --> 02:28:29,770
I don't know.

2484
02:28:29,770 --> 02:28:30,889
I'll make two axes though.

2485
02:28:30,889 --> 02:28:31,610
I feel like I need it.

2486
02:28:32,489 --> 02:28:42,780
How's the dog?

2487
02:28:43,829 --> 02:28:44,709
I have a chicken now.

2488
02:28:47,579 --> 02:28:48,139
Oh, wait.

2489
02:28:48,139 --> 02:28:49,260
This is all right.

2490
02:28:49,260 --> 02:28:50,219
This is Julie.

2491
02:28:50,219 --> 02:28:50,700
I forgot.

2492
02:28:51,260 --> 02:28:53,000
How do I turn Julie back?

2493
02:28:53,639 --> 02:28:57,639
Oh, God.

2494
02:28:57,639 --> 02:28:58,520
Okay, Julie.

2495
02:29:02,340 --> 02:29:05,540
Julie, I'm going to take your stuff.

2496
02:29:05,540 --> 02:29:06,420
Three metal scraps.

2497
02:29:06,420 --> 02:29:06,819
Oh, yeah.

2498
02:29:10,260 --> 02:29:10,819
Here, come here.

2499
02:29:10,819 --> 02:29:13,139
I need you to take some shit from me.

2500
02:29:13,780 --> 02:29:14,819
So you stay right there.

2501
02:29:15,540 --> 02:29:17,770
Take a bunch of this bullshit.

2502
02:29:17,770 --> 02:29:18,489
Here, take this.

2503
02:29:19,290 --> 02:29:21,260
Take a couple pieces of glass.

2504
02:29:21,260 --> 02:29:21,899
Take a hair.

2505
02:29:24,600 --> 02:29:26,600
Take two fucking pumpkins for all I care.

2506
02:29:26,600 --> 02:29:27,719
I need to go make a sword.

2507
02:29:28,520 --> 02:29:36,440
I got to turn.

2508
02:29:37,159 --> 02:29:38,600
Julie back to a human, I think.

2509
02:29:49,540 --> 02:29:50,180
Sword.

2510
02:29:50,180 --> 02:29:51,379
Do I make a sword or do I make a picklock?

2511
02:29:51,379 --> 02:29:51,780
What do I want?

2512
02:29:52,500 --> 02:29:55,180
Picklock is for the chest right outside the door.

2513
02:29:55,739 --> 02:29:57,180
Or do I just have a sword and kill stuff?

2514
02:29:57,899 --> 02:30:06,680
What do you think?

2515
02:30:06,680 --> 02:30:07,239
Oh, come on.

2516
02:30:07,239 --> 02:30:07,559
Really?

2517
02:30:08,579 --> 02:30:12,250
I need charcoal by cooking food first.

2518
02:30:13,940 --> 02:30:15,620
Okay, I think I have food to make.

2519
02:30:16,340 --> 02:30:19,180
I'll make it.

2520
02:30:21,379 --> 02:30:22,420
I don't think I need the sword.

2521
02:30:22,420 --> 02:30:23,620
I feel the sword is not going to help me.

2522
02:30:24,260 --> 02:30:25,860
It's already have an axe.

2523
02:30:25,860 --> 02:30:38,059
I can make cooked mushrooms.

2524
02:30:39,590 --> 02:30:45,909
Okay, that should be enough.

2525
02:30:47,030 --> 02:30:48,469
There you go.

2526
02:30:49,510 --> 02:30:53,049
Okay, now I can make the picklock and I'll go open that thing.

2527
02:30:55,399 --> 02:30:56,120
How much money do you have?

2528
02:30:56,840 --> 02:30:58,280
I think I'm just going to kill you and take your money.

2529
02:30:59,319 --> 02:31:00,920
Honestly, these guys have five, ten bucks each.

2530
02:31:07,909 --> 02:31:09,989
These dudes got five to ten dollars each.

2531
02:31:09,989 --> 02:31:11,190
I mean, I need money.

2532
02:31:11,190 --> 02:31:12,950
I fucked up the last thing I was trying to do.

2533
02:31:13,750 --> 02:31:18,889
Okay, can I make more than one?

2534
02:31:18,889 --> 02:31:21,100
I'll make two.

2535
02:31:23,459 --> 02:31:28,819
All right, let's go feed the dog and feed this guy too.

2536
02:31:28,819 --> 02:31:30,020
You want some food?

2537
02:31:30,020 --> 02:31:32,219
You want some shrooms?

2538
02:31:32,219 --> 02:31:36,059
Here, you want it?

2539
02:31:37,659 --> 02:31:42,069
No, I can't.

2540
02:31:42,069 --> 02:31:43,510
I can't feed anybody fried mushrooms.

2541
02:31:47,850 --> 02:31:48,489
All right, here we go.

2542
02:31:48,489 --> 02:31:48,809
Steak.

2543
02:31:51,059 --> 02:31:52,020
I think you're hungry.

2544
02:31:52,579 --> 02:31:53,459
You should just come with me too.

2545
02:31:59,559 --> 02:32:00,440
Should I bring the chicken?

2546
02:32:03,270 --> 02:32:03,590
Free?

2547
02:32:04,229 --> 02:32:05,770
Okay, you should be well fed.

2548
02:32:06,649 --> 02:32:09,930
All right, you two follow me because I need the help here.

2549
02:32:09,930 --> 02:32:10,250
Let's go.

2550
02:32:10,969 --> 02:32:12,889
Put on the axe.

2551
02:32:13,530 --> 02:32:15,940
Let's go try to make some more money.

2552
02:32:24,940 --> 02:32:26,299
Eighty nine percent already.

2553
02:32:26,299 --> 02:32:27,979
The lockpick thing is right there.

2554
02:32:27,979 --> 02:32:31,420
All right, like just hold on.

2555
02:32:31,420 --> 02:32:32,860
I can't sleep, so I can't pass time.

2556
02:32:35,780 --> 02:32:36,100
I can't.

2557
02:32:36,100 --> 02:32:36,819
I don't have time to get it.

2558
02:32:37,459 --> 02:32:40,090
Can I?

2559
02:32:40,090 --> 02:32:41,850
I can wait in the menu, right?

2560
02:32:41,850 --> 02:32:43,459
I thought I could.

2561
02:32:43,459 --> 02:32:43,940
Yeah, wait.

2562
02:32:45,540 --> 02:32:46,420
Waiting.

2563
02:32:46,420 --> 02:32:49,190
Okay, what time is it?

2564
02:32:51,780 --> 02:32:52,260
Is it good?

2565
02:32:53,059 --> 02:32:57,319
Oh, shit.

2566
02:32:57,319 --> 02:33:01,239
No, it takes like five seconds to get through.

2567
02:33:01,799 --> 02:33:05,989
Okay, wait.

2568
02:33:08,729 --> 02:33:09,930
I wonder what the timer is like.

2569
02:33:16,120 --> 02:33:17,079
Kill Julie.

2570
02:33:17,079 --> 02:33:18,200
I'm not going to kill Julie.

2571
02:33:18,840 --> 02:33:25,530
Why would I go kill?

2572
02:33:25,530 --> 02:33:27,370
I mean, Julie is...

2573
02:33:27,370 --> 02:33:28,409
I need to fix.

2574
02:33:28,409 --> 02:33:29,290
I need to fix Julie.

2575
02:33:29,850 --> 02:33:33,239
All right, it's currently going on.

2576
02:33:33,239 --> 02:33:36,440
I need to do a remove change on Julie.

2577
02:33:37,079 --> 02:33:38,360
Well, maybe Julie should just come with us.

2578
02:33:42,090 --> 02:33:44,250
Okay, if Julie comes with us, Julie's going to die.

2579
02:33:44,809 --> 02:33:45,770
So I'm not doing that.

2580
02:33:48,170 --> 02:33:48,969
All right, there's the storm.

2581
02:33:51,750 --> 02:33:52,549
Storm is there.

2582
02:33:53,829 --> 02:33:57,750
I'll try to purify the big giant raven dog thing.

2583
02:33:57,750 --> 02:33:58,309
See if it works.

2584
02:33:58,950 --> 02:34:02,950
Are you not live?

2585
02:34:02,950 --> 02:34:03,270
Really?

2586
02:34:05,899 --> 02:34:06,459
No, I'm not.

2587
02:34:06,459 --> 02:34:07,340
I'm not live right now.

2588
02:34:09,799 --> 02:34:11,879
I recorded this and then put it up.

2589
02:34:12,440 --> 02:34:18,520
There's a video and I streamed it.

2590
02:34:19,399 --> 02:34:21,159
And then I downloaded that stream.

2591
02:34:21,159 --> 02:34:22,520
And then that's the one that you're seeing now.

2592
02:34:23,399 --> 02:34:26,629
All right, let's go.

2593
02:34:27,190 --> 02:34:32,579
One percent.

2594
02:34:32,579 --> 02:34:33,219
I got plenty of time.

2595
02:34:33,860 --> 02:34:35,340
I want to open the chest up here.

2596
02:34:35,340 --> 02:34:36,620
And then I'm going to try to throw one of those

2597
02:34:36,620 --> 02:34:38,139
purifying pushes at the big scary thing.

2598
02:34:43,450 --> 02:34:44,729
Where is that chest?

2599
02:34:44,729 --> 02:34:46,500
It's like right here, isn't it?

2600
02:34:46,500 --> 02:34:54,920
Wasn't it like right here?

2601
02:34:55,559 --> 02:34:59,930
Where is it?

2602
02:35:00,489 --> 02:35:05,670
Where was that chest?

2603
02:35:06,229 --> 02:35:13,540
Oh, yeah, I think this is...

2604
02:35:14,340 --> 02:35:15,139
Guys, get it.

2605
02:35:15,139 --> 02:35:15,459
Kill it.

2606
02:35:16,100 --> 02:35:16,500
Kill it.

2607
02:35:20,280 --> 02:35:20,680
Kill it.

2608
02:35:21,319 --> 02:35:22,920
Thank you.

2609
02:35:26,379 --> 02:35:27,260
Why is this hurting me?

2610
02:35:27,260 --> 02:35:33,819
All right, I need to drink something.

2611
02:35:33,819 --> 02:35:34,940
Where's that lockpick thing?

2612
02:35:35,500 --> 02:35:43,030
Wasn't it like right here?

2613
02:35:43,590 --> 02:35:47,639
I need this.

2614
02:35:52,229 --> 02:35:55,049
Where's my friend?

2615
02:35:55,690 --> 02:35:56,870
What happened?

2616
02:35:56,870 --> 02:35:58,469
What happened to Clemens?

2617
02:36:00,069 --> 02:36:00,870
Where's Clemens?

2618
02:36:01,430 --> 02:36:03,459
Where did Clemens go?

2619
02:36:04,680 --> 02:36:05,479
I sent him home.

2620
02:36:05,479 --> 02:36:09,500
Oh, I pressed A on him.

2621
02:36:09,500 --> 02:36:10,620
He's not dead.

2622
02:36:10,620 --> 02:36:17,930
Let me see if this works.

2623
02:36:22,979 --> 02:36:24,100
Don't think that's...

2624
02:36:24,100 --> 02:36:24,979
I think that's locked.

2625
02:36:25,700 --> 02:36:26,979
Let me find that thing, though.

2626
02:36:36,489 --> 02:36:37,370
Is this a lock chest?

2627
02:36:37,930 --> 02:36:44,120
I have three moon stones.

2628
02:36:45,739 --> 02:36:46,940
Oh, fuck off with this.

2629
02:36:47,579 --> 02:36:50,180
What do I get rid of?

2630
02:36:51,319 --> 02:36:51,879
Here, come here.

2631
02:36:51,879 --> 02:36:52,680
You have inventory, right?

2632
02:36:55,180 --> 02:36:55,979
Take like everything.

2633
02:36:56,780 --> 02:37:01,750
Okay, there you go.

2634
02:37:02,760 --> 02:37:03,799
What the fuck happened?

2635
02:37:04,760 --> 02:37:05,239
Are we all right?

2636
02:37:06,579 --> 02:37:08,579
Dog, dog, dog, dog, dog, dog, dog.

2637
02:37:08,579 --> 02:37:09,299
Run, run, run.

2638
02:37:09,299 --> 02:37:10,020
Run over, get over.

2639
02:37:10,020 --> 02:37:11,059
Please don't die.

2640
02:37:11,059 --> 02:37:11,459
Don't die.

2641
02:37:11,459 --> 02:37:12,500
That'd be so awful if you do.

2642
02:37:13,059 --> 02:37:16,059
Go home, go home, go home.

2643
02:37:16,059 --> 02:37:16,620
Go, go home.

2644
02:37:17,180 --> 02:37:18,659
Leave, go home.

2645
02:37:18,659 --> 02:37:19,370
I don't want you...

2646
02:37:19,370 --> 02:37:20,010
Just don't die.

2647
02:37:20,010 --> 02:37:20,569
Leave.

2648
02:37:20,569 --> 02:37:22,090
Don't walk home.

2649
02:37:22,090 --> 02:37:22,649
Run home.

2650
02:37:23,209 --> 02:37:24,809
Don't walk home, run home.

2651
02:37:24,809 --> 02:37:25,209
Just run.

2652
02:37:26,010 --> 02:37:26,489
He's gonna get...

2653
02:37:26,489 --> 02:37:27,450
He's gonna step on something.

2654
02:37:27,450 --> 02:37:28,409
He's gonna fucking die.

2655
02:37:29,209 --> 02:37:30,649
Don't be quick about it.

2656
02:37:32,489 --> 02:37:34,579
Go home.

2657
02:37:34,579 --> 02:37:35,059
Is that gonna...

2658
02:37:35,059 --> 02:37:35,620
Is he gonna die?

2659
02:37:36,180 --> 02:37:36,899
I can't heal him.

2660
02:37:36,899 --> 02:37:38,659
Oh, he's over in comfort.

2661
02:37:39,979 --> 02:37:40,459
Hold on.

2662
02:37:40,459 --> 02:37:41,100
I'll fix it.

2663
02:37:41,659 --> 02:37:42,540
I'll fix it.

2664
02:37:42,540 --> 02:37:43,180
He can always die.

2665
02:37:43,180 --> 02:37:44,299
He's got three pounds.

2666
02:37:45,510 --> 02:37:46,709
He's gonna be okay.

2667
02:37:47,270 --> 02:37:48,309
I think he's gonna be fine.

2668
02:37:51,659 --> 02:37:53,979
I'm gonna purify that giant alien.

2669
02:37:53,979 --> 02:37:54,780
Let's purify this.

2670
02:37:55,500 --> 02:38:00,090
It doesn't work.

2671
02:38:00,729 --> 02:38:02,440
More than one?

2672
02:38:06,309 --> 02:38:06,790
It worked.

2673
02:38:10,170 --> 02:38:12,139
Um, what do I do?

2674
02:38:12,780 --> 02:38:16,340
Do I feed it?

2675
02:38:16,340 --> 02:38:19,370
What does it want?

2676
02:38:19,370 --> 02:38:19,850
What does it eat?

2677
02:38:20,409 --> 02:38:26,059
Would you eat worms?

2678
02:38:26,620 --> 02:38:33,750
What kind of food do they eat?

2679
02:38:33,750 --> 02:38:34,790
Favorite food?

2680
02:38:34,790 --> 02:38:35,190
I don't know.

2681
02:38:35,829 --> 02:38:37,930
Maybe it's the same thing.

2682
02:38:46,280 --> 02:38:46,680
I don't know.

2683
02:38:46,680 --> 02:38:51,610
I don't have anything.

2684
02:38:51,610 --> 02:38:52,409
Okay, here we go.

2685
02:38:52,409 --> 02:38:52,729
Chest.

2686
02:38:53,670 --> 02:38:53,989
Open.

2687
02:38:55,379 --> 02:38:56,260
Skeleton key.

2688
02:38:58,760 --> 02:39:00,840
Choose a direction in which to move your pick lock.

2689
02:39:00,840 --> 02:39:03,399
Be aware that choosing the wrong direction will force you to start over.

2690
02:39:04,889 --> 02:39:05,209
Okay.

2691
02:39:09,510 --> 02:39:10,069
Pick lock.

2692
02:39:15,620 --> 02:39:19,319
Um, up, down, no.

2693
02:39:19,319 --> 02:39:21,829
Okay, up, up, down, down.

2694
02:39:22,940 --> 02:39:24,459
Up, up, down, up.

2695
02:39:24,459 --> 02:39:26,950
I'll take the whole thing, please.

2696
02:39:28,120 --> 02:39:28,440
Cool.

2697
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:37,690
Okay.

2698
02:39:37,690 --> 02:39:38,809
That's an interesting concept.

2699
02:39:39,370 --> 02:39:44,040
So wait.

2700
02:39:44,040 --> 02:39:47,719
So I can throw the anti-corruption thing on these guys, right?

2701
02:39:47,719 --> 02:39:49,159
That would, that should work.

2702
02:39:51,559 --> 02:39:52,760
Porter and Benson.

2703
02:39:52,760 --> 02:39:53,559
All right, let me try it.

2704
02:39:54,360 --> 02:40:01,620
Shit, it wasn't enough.

2705
02:40:01,620 --> 02:40:25,049
Didn't work, so you decide to kill them.

2706
02:40:27,700 --> 02:40:29,940
I mean, what am I, what am I supposed to do?

2707
02:40:30,659 --> 02:40:40,409
All right, I'm heading back.

2708
02:40:40,409 --> 02:40:41,930
Oh, I can't move when I'm like this.

2709
02:40:43,450 --> 02:40:44,489
Uh, 46.

2710
02:40:46,579 --> 02:40:47,700
Add one perk?

2711
02:40:47,700 --> 02:40:48,659
I wonder what the bottles do.

2712
02:40:53,770 --> 02:40:57,319
Um, all right, I'm just gonna like, get this.

2713
02:40:59,270 --> 02:41:06,549
Is that enough?

2714
02:41:07,110 --> 02:41:09,639
Okay.

2715
02:41:09,639 --> 02:41:10,200
No.

2716
02:41:10,200 --> 02:41:11,860
Let's eat something.

2717
02:41:12,420 --> 02:41:17,520
Okay.

2718
02:41:18,239 --> 02:41:21,319
Let me get rid of the tea leaves.

2719
02:41:21,319 --> 02:41:22,120
Oh, I don't even need.

2720
02:41:22,120 --> 02:41:23,719
Okay, I don't need the fucking five torches.

2721
02:41:24,760 --> 02:41:26,430
Okay.

2722
02:41:26,430 --> 02:41:27,659
Did you have anything else?

2723
02:41:28,299 --> 02:41:31,760
All right, let's go back.

2724
02:41:32,319 --> 02:41:37,639
How's the spice rack coming?

2725
02:41:37,639 --> 02:41:38,360
It's coming along.

2726
02:41:39,079 --> 02:41:42,799
All right, good.

2727
02:41:42,799 --> 02:41:43,280
You made it back.

2728
02:41:43,920 --> 02:41:46,590
You got a whole inventory full of shit, right?

2729
02:41:47,309 --> 02:41:50,540
31.

2730
02:41:51,420 --> 02:41:54,510
Hydration check.

2731
02:41:55,229 --> 02:41:56,729
You got it.

2732
02:41:56,729 --> 02:42:04,000
Is this game to the end of the stream?

2733
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:05,930
The end of the stream is probably happening soon here.

2734
02:42:09,040 --> 02:42:09,760
How long did we stream for?

2735
02:42:09,760 --> 02:42:10,319
Like seven hours?

2736
02:42:11,200 --> 02:42:15,549
I want a skeleton frog.

2737
02:42:15,549 --> 02:42:16,190
How do you get this?

2738
02:42:17,149 --> 02:42:18,670
You have like cool pets.

2739
02:42:18,670 --> 02:42:19,149
That's not fair.

2740
02:42:19,870 --> 02:42:27,370
And then you guys will see me again on Monday.

2741
02:42:27,930 --> 02:42:35,579
This game looks cute.

2742
02:42:35,579 --> 02:42:36,059
It is cute.

2743
02:42:36,620 --> 02:42:42,090
It's far more efficient ways to play this game.

2744
02:42:42,090 --> 02:42:44,329
I am certain of it, but I'm having a good time.

2745
02:42:46,540 --> 02:42:47,260
Okay.

2746
02:42:47,260 --> 02:42:48,860
I wish I could make the potion.

2747
02:42:48,860 --> 02:42:50,299
It makes me a skeleton guy.

2748
02:42:52,680 --> 02:42:53,319
Samantha.

2749
02:42:53,959 --> 02:42:57,500
Samantha, you have $10 on you.

2750
02:42:57,500 --> 02:43:00,139
And I'm like, I just, I don't want to know how much money you have.

2751
02:43:00,860 --> 02:43:03,280
Oh, there you are.

2752
02:43:03,840 --> 02:43:05,389
Give me that.

2753
02:43:05,950 --> 02:43:13,579
I can make a pepper.

2754
02:43:14,139 --> 02:43:24,889
I like the music.

2755
02:43:24,889 --> 02:43:25,290
Yeah.

2756
02:43:25,290 --> 02:43:25,850
The music is good.

2757
02:43:26,569 --> 02:43:28,379
We should watch some old PSAs.

2758
02:43:29,180 --> 02:43:30,459
I definitely want to do some more infomercials.

2759
02:43:30,459 --> 02:43:31,899
I want to do some more longer infomercials.

2760
02:43:31,899 --> 02:43:32,860
Those are a lot of fun.

2761
02:43:33,659 --> 02:43:36,959
Okay.

2762
02:43:36,959 --> 02:43:38,000
What was I just going to do?

2763
02:43:38,719 --> 02:43:44,079
Who's moving?

2764
02:43:44,079 --> 02:43:46,559
Wait, why did you just move me here?

2765
02:43:47,200 --> 02:43:48,829
I didn't do that.

2766
02:43:48,829 --> 02:43:49,709
Why is it what I'm doing?

2767
02:43:49,709 --> 02:43:50,350
Is this like an event?

2768
02:43:50,350 --> 02:43:51,069
Am I supposed to be here?

2769
02:43:51,790 --> 02:43:54,399
What am I doing here?

2770
02:43:55,040 --> 02:43:59,920
What happened to Benson?

2771
02:43:59,920 --> 02:44:00,159
What?

2772
02:44:00,799 --> 02:44:02,120
My dog?

2773
02:44:02,120 --> 02:44:03,399
Oh no, I killed Benson.

2774
02:44:03,399 --> 02:44:03,959
All right.

2775
02:44:03,959 --> 02:44:04,520
Fuck Benson.

2776
02:44:04,520 --> 02:44:04,840
Who cares?

2777
02:44:06,620 --> 02:44:09,260
I was so concerned for one second.

2778
02:44:10,059 --> 02:44:12,040
I thought that was one of my friends.

2779
02:44:19,549 --> 02:44:20,270
Oops.

2780
02:44:20,270 --> 02:44:23,340
All right.

2781
02:44:23,340 --> 02:44:24,940
There's the moonstone thing, right?

2782
02:44:29,309 --> 02:44:30,270
This is the moonstone thing.

2783
02:44:30,989 --> 02:44:31,709
I'm certain of it.

2784
02:44:33,610 --> 02:44:33,850
Yep.

2785
02:44:34,409 --> 02:44:34,889
Yep.

2786
02:44:34,889 --> 02:44:35,370
Yep.

2787
02:44:35,370 --> 02:44:35,770
Yep.

2788
02:44:35,770 --> 02:44:36,170
Okay.

2789
02:44:36,170 --> 02:44:37,770
I have three moonstones.

2790
02:44:37,770 --> 02:44:38,569
They're back at the house.

2791
02:44:39,129 --> 02:44:40,250
The corruption thing is going to happen.

2792
02:44:40,250 --> 02:44:41,930
I'm going to open the moonstone chest

2793
02:44:41,930 --> 02:44:44,090
and then I'm going to get a hundred dollars

2794
02:44:44,090 --> 02:44:44,969
and we're going to take

2795
02:44:45,770 --> 02:44:47,690
the group of fucking idiots back over here.

2796
02:44:48,489 --> 02:44:53,799
I have so much stuff.

2797
02:44:53,799 --> 02:44:54,440
I got a store.

2798
02:44:56,250 --> 02:44:57,049
Strup.

2799
02:44:57,049 --> 02:44:57,610
Strup is...

2800
02:44:58,569 --> 02:44:59,760
Okay.

2801
02:45:00,399 --> 02:45:01,049
All right.

2802
02:45:01,049 --> 02:45:03,930
I'm coming back here with three moonstones.

2803
02:45:03,930 --> 02:45:13,370
For real.

2804
02:45:13,370 --> 02:45:15,049
I'm opening that moonstone chest

2805
02:45:15,049 --> 02:45:17,680
and it's going to be a hundred bucks in it.

2806
02:45:17,680 --> 02:45:20,479
It's going to be amazing.

2807
02:45:21,040 --> 02:45:28,379
Any more of these?

2808
02:45:28,940 --> 02:45:34,479
I don't think I have these.

2809
02:45:35,120 --> 02:45:36,639
Has anybody picked these up yet?

2810
02:45:36,639 --> 02:45:37,440
Come on, come get them.

2811
02:45:38,159 --> 02:45:40,459
Maybe I should stop killing townspeople.

2812
02:45:40,459 --> 02:45:41,260
Maybe that would help.

2813
02:45:41,899 --> 02:45:47,100
Here, I saw you at Chili's yesterday.

2814
02:45:47,100 --> 02:45:48,379
You ordered the chicken crispers,

2815
02:45:48,379 --> 02:45:50,059
peeled the crispers off and the chicken

2816
02:45:50,059 --> 02:45:51,979
and then swallowed the chicken meat whole like a snake.

2817
02:45:54,649 --> 02:45:55,530
Was that you?

2818
02:45:55,530 --> 02:45:56,409
Was that you watching?

2819
02:45:56,409 --> 02:45:56,889
Was that you?

2820
02:45:57,690 --> 02:46:01,049
All right.

2821
02:46:01,049 --> 02:46:01,770
Let me research.

2822
02:46:07,069 --> 02:46:08,110
Oh, I'm going to figure it out.

2823
02:46:08,110 --> 02:46:08,909
What's ghoul skin?

2824
02:46:18,639 --> 02:46:19,200
All right.

2825
02:46:19,200 --> 02:46:20,079
Dump all this crap.

2826
02:46:25,309 --> 02:46:25,790
Bottles.

2827
02:46:27,520 --> 02:46:28,479
Get this out of here.

2828
02:46:29,280 --> 02:46:31,739
I'm going to keep the pick logs.

2829
02:46:31,739 --> 02:46:33,340
I don't know what this dag is really for, but...

2830
02:46:34,860 --> 02:46:35,579
Textiles.

2831
02:46:36,860 --> 02:46:37,579
Use the tomb.

2832
02:46:38,379 --> 02:46:39,180
Keep the worms.

2833
02:46:39,180 --> 02:46:39,420
Okay.

2834
02:46:41,610 --> 02:46:42,649
I don't need as many berries.

2835
02:46:43,290 --> 02:46:48,430
This axe is almost dead.

2836
02:46:48,430 --> 02:46:49,309
I'm just going to throw it away.

2837
02:46:51,610 --> 02:46:51,850
Okay.

2838
02:46:53,260 --> 02:46:55,180
So now the plan is

2839
02:46:55,979 --> 02:46:58,780
make a hot chilling...

2840
02:46:58,780 --> 02:46:59,500
Sizzling pepper.

2841
02:47:00,459 --> 02:47:00,700
Cool.

2842
02:47:08,280 --> 02:47:09,399
You doing an EU stream?

2843
02:47:10,200 --> 02:47:10,680
No, I'm...

2844
02:47:13,870 --> 02:47:16,190
I'm interested enough in the game to kind of keep playing it.

2845
02:47:16,829 --> 02:47:19,840
I just want to see...

2846
02:47:19,840 --> 02:47:21,440
I want to see what I can do with this.

2847
02:47:22,079 --> 02:47:22,799
I need to know.

2848
02:47:23,520 --> 02:47:29,180
How much is it?

2849
02:47:30,620 --> 02:47:31,979
I've got 31 coins.

2850
02:47:33,790 --> 02:47:34,430
Excuse me?

2851
02:47:35,149 --> 02:47:42,879
Just stole my shit.

2852
02:47:42,879 --> 02:47:44,559
No, don't fight everybody in town.

2853
02:47:45,120 --> 02:47:47,360
Why is the skeleton fighting this kid?

2854
02:47:47,360 --> 02:47:49,200
Well, he just killed that kid.

2855
02:47:49,200 --> 02:47:50,239
You killed a kid.

2856
02:47:50,959 --> 02:47:52,079
You just killed a kid.

2857
02:47:52,879 --> 02:47:54,639
I have to kill everybody.

2858
02:47:54,639 --> 02:47:54,959
Why?

2859
02:47:54,959 --> 02:47:55,840
What's happening?

2860
02:47:55,840 --> 02:47:57,280
Why did you just do that?

2861
02:47:57,280 --> 02:47:57,920
I'm going to die.

2862
02:47:57,920 --> 02:47:58,559
Where's Clemens?

2863
02:48:00,909 --> 02:48:03,069
What the fuck was that?

2864
02:48:05,149 --> 02:48:07,149
He just beat that kid to death with a shovel.

2865
02:48:08,799 --> 02:48:10,319
What the fuck just happened?

2866
02:48:11,209 --> 02:48:12,170
I'm a human again.

2867
02:48:13,600 --> 02:48:14,239
I'm human.

2868
02:48:14,239 --> 02:48:15,280
I'm actually human again.

2869
02:48:17,530 --> 02:48:19,450
Dude, you just hit that kid with the...

2870
02:48:19,450 --> 02:48:21,049
Did you hit that kid in the face with the shovel?

2871
02:48:21,049 --> 02:48:21,770
Did that get dead?

2872
02:48:23,149 --> 02:48:24,750
I'm actually a human.

2873
02:48:24,750 --> 02:48:29,520
Honest to God, what the fuck just happened?

2874
02:48:29,520 --> 02:48:31,280
A rat stole my wallet.

2875
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,079
So I hit the rat in the head with an axe.

2876
02:48:34,079 --> 02:48:36,559
And now everybody's dead.

2877
02:48:37,440 --> 02:48:38,969
Yeah, that...

2878
02:48:40,399 --> 02:48:41,040
Excuse me.

2879
02:48:41,040 --> 02:48:41,600
Excuse me.

2880
02:48:54,170 --> 02:48:55,450
Are you fucking kidding me?

2881
02:49:02,540 --> 02:49:04,540
I forgot how good apples tasted.

2882
02:49:05,180 --> 02:49:06,920
I'm going to die again, aren't I?

2883
02:49:07,879 --> 02:49:10,040
Why are these people so fucking hostile?

2884
02:49:13,899 --> 02:49:15,180
All right, I need to eat food.

2885
02:49:15,180 --> 02:49:15,979
Ron, just run away.

2886
02:49:15,979 --> 02:49:16,459
Run away.

2887
02:49:16,459 --> 02:49:17,100
You killed...

2888
02:49:20,090 --> 02:49:21,209
This thing moved so fast.

2889
02:49:21,209 --> 02:49:21,450
I didn't...

2890
02:49:21,450 --> 02:49:22,010
Where's the chicken?

2891
02:49:22,010 --> 02:49:22,409
I need to...

2892
02:49:22,409 --> 02:49:23,450
Wait, go back to the camp.

2893
02:49:23,450 --> 02:49:23,770
The dog.

2894
02:49:25,770 --> 02:49:26,170
My dog.

2895
02:49:26,170 --> 02:49:27,370
My dog, dog, dog, dog, dog.

2896
02:49:27,370 --> 02:49:29,209
Help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help.

2897
02:49:29,930 --> 02:49:32,569
I gotta let the dog out.

2898
02:49:32,569 --> 02:49:33,290
The dog's gonna help.

2899
02:49:36,479 --> 02:49:37,120
Help me.

2900
02:49:37,120 --> 02:49:38,079
Help me.

2901
02:49:38,079 --> 02:49:38,799
Help me, please.

2902
02:49:39,520 --> 02:49:54,639
Oh, why can't I open the gate?

2903
02:49:59,610 --> 02:49:59,850
Help.

2904
02:49:59,850 --> 02:50:03,309
Oh no.

2905
02:50:03,309 --> 02:50:03,950
Help, please.

2906
02:50:04,909 --> 02:50:07,309
Protect me, protect me, protect me, protect me.

2907
02:50:08,520 --> 02:50:09,000
Protect me.

2908
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:10,120
They killed Julie too.

2909
02:50:11,420 --> 02:50:11,979
Bastards.

2910
02:50:15,040 --> 02:50:18,250
Okay, just get me out.

2911
02:50:19,840 --> 02:50:21,600
This motherfucker chasing me with the shovel.

2912
02:50:21,600 --> 02:50:23,520
I need to pick up more health potions that are on the ground.

2913
02:50:25,209 --> 02:50:26,170
Where's the dog?

2914
02:50:27,629 --> 02:50:29,229
That's so fucked up.

2915
02:50:29,229 --> 02:50:30,190
That's so fucked up.

2916
02:50:38,299 --> 02:50:39,420
Stop, you fucker.

2917
02:50:40,059 --> 02:50:46,479
I need a weapon.

2918
02:50:46,479 --> 02:50:47,200
I'm gonna die again.

2919
02:50:48,719 --> 02:50:49,520
What happened to the dog?

2920
02:50:50,399 --> 02:50:51,760
All right, just go in here and close the gate.

2921
02:50:51,760 --> 02:50:52,559
They won't be able to get in.

2922
02:50:53,120 --> 02:50:56,829
Close, close, close, close.

2923
02:50:56,829 --> 02:50:58,350
Don't let this fucking giant snake in here.

2924
02:51:00,729 --> 02:51:01,049
Help.

2925
02:51:11,450 --> 02:51:12,409
Help me, please.

2926
02:51:13,209 --> 02:51:19,920
All right, I'm good.

2927
02:51:19,920 --> 02:51:20,319
I need...

2928
02:51:20,319 --> 02:51:21,040
I have an axe, right?

2929
02:51:24,799 --> 02:51:25,200
Julie.

2930
02:51:26,329 --> 02:51:26,569
No.

2931
02:51:27,530 --> 02:51:41,549
Did I get everything from the bag?

2932
02:51:42,110 --> 02:51:46,969
Oh my fucking god, I'm gonna die again.

2933
02:51:47,530 --> 02:51:48,010
He's running.

2934
02:51:54,620 --> 02:51:56,059
I'm so confused at what happened.

2935
02:51:56,700 --> 02:51:58,569
They're not gonna chase me over here, are they?

2936
02:52:00,760 --> 02:52:01,719
That was just chaos.

2937
02:52:02,280 --> 02:52:07,000
All right, none of you attack me, please.

2938
02:52:08,040 --> 02:52:10,440
There's a maniac over on the other side of town.

2939
02:52:10,440 --> 02:52:14,760
All right, sit down.

2940
02:52:14,760 --> 02:52:16,920
There's a fucking maniac over there.

2941
02:52:31,549 --> 02:52:31,870
Let me...

2942
02:52:32,750 --> 02:52:34,940
I need to eat some stuff.

2943
02:52:35,819 --> 02:52:38,969
This fish is raw.

2944
02:52:39,690 --> 02:52:44,120
Okay, let me cook this stuff.

2945
02:52:44,760 --> 02:52:48,940
You're supposed to talk to the owner about it,

2946
02:52:48,940 --> 02:52:51,340
but you just killed the rat after the rat stole?

2947
02:52:51,340 --> 02:52:52,780
I think the rats just steal.

2948
02:52:52,780 --> 02:52:53,659
I think they just do that.

2949
02:52:54,620 --> 02:53:03,610
Okay, getting better.

2950
02:53:04,170 --> 02:53:05,129
Just eat worms, whatever.

2951
02:53:06,649 --> 02:53:10,540
All right, what was the plan here?

2952
02:53:11,579 --> 02:53:18,379
Get rid of the broom.

2953
02:53:19,020 --> 02:53:19,819
I don't need these.

2954
02:53:21,180 --> 02:53:23,840
I don't need this much glass.

2955
02:53:24,799 --> 02:53:25,520
Store the hair.

2956
02:53:25,520 --> 02:53:26,639
Store the logs.

2957
02:53:26,639 --> 02:53:27,600
Store the mandragora.

2958
02:53:28,479 --> 02:53:29,680
Store the scrap.

2959
02:53:29,680 --> 02:53:30,319
Store the lab.

2960
02:53:32,079 --> 02:53:33,559
Store the hunger.

2961
02:53:36,520 --> 02:53:37,799
Yeah, I don't need the textiles.

2962
02:53:38,360 --> 02:53:42,040
Actually, I need to examine these.

2963
02:53:42,680 --> 02:53:52,399
Okay, add five vitality.

2964
02:53:54,250 --> 02:54:00,459
Okay, very nice.

2965
02:54:04,959 --> 02:54:06,319
Is that right speaker crow?

2966
02:54:06,319 --> 02:54:07,840
Every time I swear it's out of my window.

2967
02:54:14,399 --> 02:54:17,200
All right, let me see if I can get something done here.

2968
02:54:20,829 --> 02:54:22,590
Well, at least one thing you know from this game is

2969
02:54:26,969 --> 02:54:27,850
it's actually kind of...

2970
02:54:28,959 --> 02:54:29,840
You have to really think.

2971
02:54:30,559 --> 02:54:31,600
You can't just run around with a...

2972
02:54:35,159 --> 02:54:37,000
What do I do about this guy, though?

2973
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:37,959
I mean, he's the kid.

2974
02:54:38,760 --> 02:54:41,069
I feel so bad about this.

2975
02:54:42,879 --> 02:54:43,920
What do I do about this?

2976
02:54:48,809 --> 02:54:50,489
It's this motherfucker right here.

2977
02:54:50,489 --> 02:54:55,959
What did you get?

2978
02:54:56,780 --> 02:54:58,379
All right, where's your boss?

2979
02:54:59,180 --> 02:55:05,879
Where's your boss?

2980
02:55:06,600 --> 02:55:11,209
Hi, Samantha.

2981
02:55:20,299 --> 02:55:21,260
Hey, Samantha, don't...

2982
02:55:23,260 --> 02:55:26,219
Don't pay no attention to the dead kid that's over here.

2983
02:55:27,020 --> 02:55:28,299
No, don't worry about that.

2984
02:55:29,340 --> 02:55:31,819
We're just going to be farming crops and shit together.

2985
02:55:33,709 --> 02:55:34,750
I forgot about Julie.

2986
02:55:34,750 --> 02:55:36,110
How do I get rid of them?

2987
02:55:36,750 --> 02:55:40,270
This is such a scary, awful, terrible reminder of the awful things happening.

2988
02:55:42,780 --> 02:55:43,739
I feel so bad.

2989
02:55:44,540 --> 02:55:45,659
At least the dog's still here.

2990
02:55:54,059 --> 02:55:58,270
I remember I had friends.

2991
02:55:58,270 --> 02:55:58,909
Hi, rogue.

2992
02:56:07,290 --> 02:56:09,370
Pay no attention to the dead kid, honest.

2993
02:56:10,649 --> 02:56:12,489
But that's in the video game.

2994
02:56:13,129 --> 02:56:14,090
That's in the video game.

2995
02:56:18,110 --> 02:56:22,510
Jerma, can you knock on the closet with the closest air vent in your room?

2996
02:56:25,680 --> 02:56:26,959
You are fucking weird, man.

2997
02:56:31,239 --> 02:56:32,280
You're fucking weird.

2998
02:56:33,530 --> 02:56:36,459
All right, I want...

2999
02:56:36,940 --> 02:56:39,549
Yeah, I can't believe I blew it.

3000
02:56:39,549 --> 02:56:42,510
I could have cleansed the tree by now and I fucked it all up.

3001
02:56:43,850 --> 02:56:47,370
I need another $70 and I need someone to carry the thing.

3002
02:56:48,090 --> 02:56:49,709
All right, I'm making money.

3003
02:56:52,239 --> 02:56:53,360
Dog, I need you to come with me.

3004
02:56:59,129 --> 02:56:59,770
You're pretty...

3005
02:56:59,770 --> 02:57:00,250
Yeah, you're good.

3006
02:57:00,250 --> 02:57:00,969
You got enough health.

3007
02:57:01,610 --> 02:57:07,469
Is that motherfucker?

3008
02:57:08,110 --> 02:57:13,719
What was that person's name?

3009
02:57:14,280 --> 02:57:22,700
I don't think it's still here.

3010
02:57:23,420 --> 02:57:28,479
Yeah, they've got...

3011
02:57:28,479 --> 02:57:29,600
There was somebody else.

3012
02:57:29,600 --> 02:57:35,020
I need to sell more stuff.

3013
02:57:35,739 --> 02:57:36,799
No, I don't.

3014
02:57:36,799 --> 02:57:37,200
Get out.

3015
02:57:37,840 --> 02:57:42,090
All right, it's been almost seven hours.

3016
02:57:42,090 --> 02:57:43,209
I should probably...

3017
02:57:43,770 --> 02:57:44,329
Call it tonight.

3018
02:57:51,370 --> 02:57:53,049
I need to pick that up.

3019
02:57:53,049 --> 02:58:00,280
All right, where's the...

3020
02:58:00,280 --> 02:58:01,239
Oh, the undertaker, right?

3021
02:58:01,239 --> 02:58:02,120
Let me do that.

3022
02:58:02,120 --> 02:58:07,280
This is a Q game.

3023
02:58:08,079 --> 02:58:11,680
Yeah, honestly, I think this is worth playing.

3024
02:58:13,020 --> 02:58:14,299
This might be a sponsored stream.

3025
02:58:14,299 --> 02:58:16,219
This is the first game sponsored stream I ever did.

3026
02:58:18,190 --> 02:58:20,989
I very much enjoyed myself as much as I was not very good.

3027
02:58:22,809 --> 02:58:24,170
Again, this is on Steam.

3028
02:58:24,170 --> 02:58:25,530
It's on PS5.

3029
02:58:25,530 --> 02:58:26,250
It's on Xbox.

3030
02:58:26,250 --> 02:58:26,649
It's on...

3031
02:58:26,649 --> 02:58:27,850
I think it's on pretty much everything.

3032
02:58:30,319 --> 02:58:31,760
What level of solid are your teeth?

3033
02:58:32,700 --> 02:58:33,260
Pretty solid.

3034
02:58:33,979 --> 02:58:38,540
Okay, so I need to be able to...

3035
02:58:38,540 --> 02:58:39,899
There are four bodies at the camp.

3036
02:58:43,280 --> 02:58:44,399
What, we're burying them?

3037
02:58:45,120 --> 02:58:47,180
I don't have four.

3038
02:58:47,180 --> 02:58:48,299
I don't have five shovels.

3039
02:58:49,100 --> 02:58:54,989
I actually have to bury them.

3040
02:58:54,989 --> 02:58:56,670
I need to make shovels to bury them.

3041
02:58:59,360 --> 02:59:00,959
I think there's definitely enough here.

3042
02:59:01,760 --> 02:59:04,809
I mean, I've been playing this for like almost three hours.

3043
02:59:07,579 --> 02:59:08,620
Oh, wait.

3044
02:59:08,620 --> 02:59:09,819
I can open this guy's chest.

3045
02:59:09,819 --> 02:59:11,100
Okay, no, I don't want to fuck this up.

3046
02:59:11,100 --> 02:59:12,780
Up, down, up, down.

3047
02:59:13,420 --> 02:59:15,739
Okay, up, down, up, up, up, up.

3048
02:59:16,620 --> 02:59:19,239
Butterflies.

3049
02:59:19,879 --> 02:59:20,200
Shovel.

3050
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:21,799
Silver Cross.

3051
02:59:22,680 --> 02:59:25,950
Grants 5% chance to block incoming damage.

3052
02:59:25,950 --> 02:59:26,590
It's like a shield.

3053
02:59:27,389 --> 02:59:30,639
Cool.

3054
02:59:32,829 --> 02:59:34,920
Let's say read notes.

3055
02:59:36,360 --> 02:59:39,469
I feel like I haven't really scratched the surface of the game.

3056
02:59:39,469 --> 02:59:42,969
And I've just been kind of wandering around just doing dumb stuff.

3057
02:59:46,319 --> 02:59:48,239
If I had put that thing down and not placed it,

3058
02:59:48,239 --> 02:59:50,079
I would have been progressed much farther, I think.

3059
02:59:53,229 --> 02:59:54,350
But yeah, it's available.

3060
02:59:54,350 --> 02:59:55,870
They sponsored this part of the stream.

3061
02:59:58,489 --> 02:59:59,290
That's really cool.

3062
02:59:59,370 --> 03:00:03,690
I'm happy to do sponsorships for stuff that I think is interesting.

3063
03:00:05,840 --> 03:00:06,959
Going forward, I don't know.

3064
03:00:06,959 --> 03:00:07,680
We'll see.

3065
03:00:07,680 --> 03:00:08,879
I'm open to pretty much anything.

3066
03:00:09,440 --> 03:00:11,319
But this was the Serpent Rogue.

3067
03:00:12,200 --> 03:00:13,879
I would say I recommend it.

3068
03:00:13,879 --> 03:00:19,450
I think there's enough here to have fun.

3069
03:00:20,170 --> 03:00:21,440
I very much enjoyed it.

3070
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:28,680
Yeah, I would probably rather do stuff like this

3071
03:00:28,680 --> 03:00:34,120
than do something that you've seen a thousand times, right?

3072
03:00:34,840 --> 03:00:36,040
For like a sponsorship.

3073
03:00:36,040 --> 03:00:37,239
But I mean, it depends.

3074
03:00:37,239 --> 03:00:38,200
What am I doing?

3075
03:00:38,200 --> 03:00:38,760
What's the point?

3076
03:00:40,040 --> 03:00:41,479
How many projects are coming up, right?

3077
03:00:42,200 --> 03:00:46,440
Yeah, I think hopefully I showed enough for you

3078
03:00:46,440 --> 03:00:48,680
to think if you want to check it out.

3079
03:00:48,680 --> 03:00:49,639
By all means, please do.

3080
03:00:50,280 --> 03:00:51,159
If not, then cool.

3081
03:00:53,159 --> 03:00:56,360
Huge, huge thank you to Team17 and Senji Games.

3082
03:00:56,360 --> 03:00:57,159
Hope I'm saying that right.

3083
03:00:57,879 --> 03:00:59,229
You got a cute little game here.

3084
03:01:00,840 --> 03:01:03,079
And I feel like I haven't really done anything.

3085
03:01:03,079 --> 03:01:04,200
And I've been playing for like three hours.

3086
03:01:04,200 --> 03:01:07,600
It seems like there's a lot to unpack.

3087
03:01:08,319 --> 03:01:15,290
But I'm very happy.

3088
03:01:16,479 --> 03:01:18,239
I think it's definitely worth playing.

3089
03:01:23,159 --> 03:01:25,319
And if you're coming up with a good system

3090
03:01:25,319 --> 03:01:27,479
when you first start, it's definitely worth.

3091
03:01:27,479 --> 03:01:28,840
This is a man-sized game.

3092
03:01:28,840 --> 03:01:30,600
Yeah, this is definitely a man-sized game.

3093
03:01:43,370 --> 03:01:44,569
Networking Andy?

3094
03:01:44,569 --> 03:01:45,370
That's no.

3095
03:01:48,639 --> 03:01:50,879
But yeah, I think that'll wrap it up.

3096
03:01:50,879 --> 03:01:51,440
Seven hours.

3097
03:01:56,479 --> 03:01:57,840
We should do the more infomercials.

3098
03:01:57,840 --> 03:01:58,639
We absolutely will.

3099
03:01:58,639 --> 03:01:59,440
That was so much fun.

3100
03:02:02,479 --> 03:02:03,760
That was an absolute blast.

3101
03:02:07,079 --> 03:02:09,239
Next stream is going to be Monday.

3102
03:02:09,239 --> 03:02:11,840
I don't really know what we're going to do yet.

3103
03:02:11,840 --> 03:02:15,850
The lockpicking looks sick.

3104
03:02:15,850 --> 03:02:18,170
I am going to imagine that eventually later on,

3105
03:02:18,170 --> 03:02:19,370
those are much harder.

3106
03:02:21,850 --> 03:02:25,209
I have, okay, the issue that I have with a game like this

3107
03:02:25,209 --> 03:02:27,950
is I don't want to let go of anything.

3108
03:02:27,950 --> 03:02:29,559
I want to keep everything.

3109
03:02:29,559 --> 03:02:33,290
I just want to keep every feather, every like chicken bone.

3110
03:02:33,290 --> 03:02:34,489
I just want to keep everything.

3111
03:02:34,489 --> 03:02:38,399
I just, I have to hold on to everything.

3112
03:02:38,399 --> 03:02:39,920
Can you take off your wig?

3113
03:02:41,180 --> 03:02:42,620
Nah, it's glued on.

3114
03:02:42,620 --> 03:02:49,200
This was neat.

3115
03:02:49,200 --> 03:02:52,799
Well, I hope it was at least worth and fun to watch

3116
03:02:52,799 --> 03:02:53,520
and worth checking out.

3117
03:02:54,239 --> 03:03:00,430
Well, see, I might just play this.

3118
03:03:01,469 --> 03:03:03,549
I don't know how much I'm going to stream it.

3119
03:03:03,549 --> 03:03:06,110
But I feel like it's kind of a fun game to play.

3120
03:03:06,110 --> 03:03:06,510
We'll see.

3121
03:03:07,149 --> 03:03:09,079
Oh, Stanley Parable is out, the new one.

3122
03:03:09,079 --> 03:03:09,479
That's right.

3123
03:03:10,440 --> 03:03:15,069
Maybe we'll do that on Monday.

3124
03:03:15,069 --> 03:03:15,709
But thank you.

3125
03:03:15,709 --> 03:03:18,670
This is the first ever game sponsor stream.

3126
03:03:18,670 --> 03:03:20,270
This is very new to me.

3127
03:03:21,719 --> 03:03:27,069
I would say you could probably expect stuff like this

3128
03:03:27,069 --> 03:03:28,190
to happen more often now.

3129
03:03:28,190 --> 03:03:31,930
Not all the time, but like I said to you earlier,

3130
03:03:31,930 --> 03:03:33,799
I've evolved.

3131
03:03:33,799 --> 03:03:34,840
I've been working with them now

3132
03:03:34,840 --> 03:03:36,680
and I've been presented a bunch of stuff.

3133
03:03:36,680 --> 03:03:40,170
This is the first thing that I thought was worth showcasing.

3134
03:03:40,170 --> 03:03:44,920
So they'll pop up from time to time.

3135
03:03:44,920 --> 03:03:45,639
You'll know what they are.

3136
03:03:45,639 --> 03:03:46,840
I'll make sure you know.

3137
03:03:46,840 --> 03:03:50,989
How's my sleep schedule?

3138
03:03:50,989 --> 03:03:51,549
It's not bad.

3139
03:03:51,549 --> 03:03:52,350
It's pretty good.

3140
03:03:52,350 --> 03:04:00,319
Variety streamer.

3141
03:04:00,319 --> 03:04:01,120
Yeah, we'll get a plan.

3142
03:04:01,120 --> 03:04:02,799
The Bugsnax DLC is out too.

3143
03:04:02,799 --> 03:04:04,010
Interesting.

3144
03:04:10,909 --> 03:04:12,110
What's the state of your port?

3145
03:04:12,110 --> 03:04:13,309
Do I have to save the game?

3146
03:04:13,309 --> 03:04:15,420
I think it just saves automatically, right?

3147
03:04:16,219 --> 03:04:18,459
32 people killed, one person healed.

3148
03:04:19,629 --> 03:04:21,790
One tamed, five deaths.

3149
03:04:21,790 --> 03:04:22,350
That's kind of cool.

3150
03:04:22,350 --> 03:04:22,989
Keeps track of that.

3151
03:04:25,370 --> 03:04:26,969
Let me see what else is in the menu here.

3152
03:04:28,540 --> 03:04:31,450
Okay, no, I think it's just single player.

3153
03:04:31,450 --> 03:04:32,649
Yeah, single player.

3154
03:04:35,500 --> 03:04:37,100
I just killed everybody I could.

3155
03:04:37,100 --> 03:04:39,420
But I didn't know.

3156
03:04:39,979 --> 03:04:48,430
I might get the game, honestly.

3157
03:04:48,989 --> 03:04:50,350
Yeah, you are free to.

3158
03:04:50,350 --> 03:04:51,870
If you don't want it or you do want it.

3159
03:04:51,870 --> 03:04:54,270
I mean, I'm not going to tell you what to do.

3160
03:04:54,829 --> 03:04:58,670
But I will tell you that I enjoyed that three hours that I just played.

3161
03:04:59,309 --> 03:05:01,690
That's it.

3162
03:05:01,690 --> 03:05:04,219
What's your favorite boss in Elden Rings?

3163
03:05:06,319 --> 03:05:07,280
Horror Loot.

3164
03:05:07,280 --> 03:05:15,610
The soundtrack is good too.

3165
03:05:15,610 --> 03:05:16,649
This is nice.

3166
03:05:16,649 --> 03:05:19,229
Maybe we'll have this play us up.

3167
03:05:19,790 --> 03:05:21,360
I like it.

3168
03:05:21,360 --> 03:05:26,840
Oh, never mind.

3169
03:05:27,399 --> 03:05:28,360
There we go.

3170
03:05:28,360 --> 03:05:31,200
How much does the game cost?

3171
03:05:31,200 --> 03:05:33,520
The game is right now, it is 10% off.

3172
03:05:34,319 --> 03:05:35,520
$17.99.

3173
03:05:35,520 --> 03:05:39,959
It'll probably go up to $19.20.

3174
03:05:39,959 --> 03:05:43,930
So on every platform, all the major ones on the new consoles.

3175
03:05:44,569 --> 03:05:55,959
Heavily focused on the crafting.

3176
03:05:55,959 --> 03:05:59,760
Which I probably could have done it a little more streamlined.

3177
03:05:59,760 --> 03:06:00,879
I could have been a little better about it.

3178
03:06:00,879 --> 03:06:03,120
But I just saw it and I was like, make potions.

3179
03:06:14,600 --> 03:06:15,639
This is a fun one today.

3180
03:06:16,280 --> 03:06:18,840
The infomercials then coming into this.

3181
03:06:18,840 --> 03:06:19,319
That was fun.

3182
03:06:19,959 --> 03:06:24,000
I had a very good time today.

3183
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:25,200
Hope you all did too.

3184
03:06:25,200 --> 03:06:39,959
Will you play Inscription again at some point?

3185
03:06:43,450 --> 03:06:44,010
I don't know.

3186
03:06:44,010 --> 03:06:46,010
I feel like I want to play that on my own time.

3187
03:06:46,010 --> 03:06:51,260
I feel like my brain is too scattered to do a card game like that.

3188
03:06:52,059 --> 03:06:54,379
More infomercials?

3189
03:06:54,379 --> 03:06:54,700
We will.

3190
03:06:56,569 --> 03:06:57,610
It's not going to take very long.

3191
03:06:58,170 --> 03:07:02,489
I promise that we're not going to wait three or four weeks to do more infomercials.

3192
03:07:03,049 --> 03:07:06,590
We will do that within the next two or three streams.

3193
03:07:06,590 --> 03:07:08,190
We're just going to do that again immediately.

3194
03:07:08,829 --> 03:07:19,180
Don't forget to moisturize.

3195
03:07:19,180 --> 03:07:19,579
That's true.

3196
03:07:21,790 --> 03:07:23,069
You should absolutely moisturize.

3197
03:07:26,399 --> 03:07:31,579
Do Stanley Parable and infomercials on Monday.

3198
03:07:34,010 --> 03:07:35,049
That sounds like a good idea.

3199
03:07:41,639 --> 03:07:43,739
Very cool.

3200
03:07:43,739 --> 03:07:44,059
All right.

3201
03:07:44,059 --> 03:07:47,659
Again, thank you so much to Team17 and Cengi Games.

3202
03:07:49,239 --> 03:07:50,680
Thanks for watching that.

3203
03:07:50,680 --> 03:07:53,879
I know that sponsored content is something you're not used to on this stream

3204
03:07:53,879 --> 03:07:55,239
and something that is a lot different.

3205
03:07:57,260 --> 03:08:00,540
And I'll be really honest, I was a little concerned.

3206
03:08:01,340 --> 03:08:03,579
Because I just don't want, you know, obviously people to think,

3207
03:08:05,469 --> 03:08:07,229
like, oh, here comes the first sponsored stream.

3208
03:08:07,229 --> 03:08:07,790
It's over.

3209
03:08:08,670 --> 03:08:10,430
I'm going to get these every fucking day.

3210
03:08:10,430 --> 03:08:14,590
And not only that, it's going to be, oh, it's going to be egregious.

3211
03:08:14,590 --> 03:08:17,870
Oh, he's going to be, he's going to keep, she's going to shill so much bullshit.

3212
03:08:18,909 --> 03:08:21,549
I hope I can prove to you that that's not the case.

3213
03:08:33,790 --> 03:08:37,790
But there are plenty of companies and plenty of games and plenty of things that I would

3214
03:08:37,790 --> 03:08:39,549
probably do and I'd be interested in.

3215
03:08:39,549 --> 03:08:40,190
And this was one of them.

3216
03:08:40,190 --> 03:08:43,520
So sponsors are cool.

3217
03:08:43,520 --> 03:08:45,280
We know you're not a money grabber.

3218
03:08:45,920 --> 03:08:47,979
Oh, I can turn this off.

3219
03:08:55,659 --> 03:08:56,139
Sell out.

3220
03:08:56,299 --> 03:08:57,420
What is, what is going on?

3221
03:08:57,420 --> 03:09:00,940
Somebody said, what is, what is Joel doing?

3222
03:09:01,579 --> 03:09:02,459
Bill's doing something.

3223
03:09:02,459 --> 03:09:03,899
What's Joel doing?

3224
03:09:04,620 --> 03:09:09,760
Yeah, well, go to Joel.

3225
03:09:10,479 --> 03:09:12,079
They're doing a charity thing.

3226
03:09:12,639 --> 03:09:21,920
Is it still going on right now?

3227
03:09:21,920 --> 03:09:22,559
Yeah, let's go.

3228
03:09:23,200 --> 03:09:35,399
You're a businessman.

3229
03:09:36,200 --> 03:09:38,729
Oh, if that were the case, I would, I mean, if I was an executive,

3230
03:09:38,729 --> 03:09:41,049
I would have a fucking big smoothie and a huge ring.

3231
03:09:41,930 --> 03:09:49,770
God, that was so much fun.

3232
03:09:50,489 --> 03:09:52,590
I'm so glad that that was fun.

3233
03:09:53,309 --> 03:09:55,530
All right, let's go, Ray Joel.

3234
03:09:56,409 --> 03:09:56,969
Thanks again.

3235
03:09:56,969 --> 03:09:59,129
If you stuck around, I know we went late.

3236
03:09:59,129 --> 03:09:59,930
I know we started late.

3237
03:09:59,930 --> 03:10:02,170
I know a lot of people, they just, you know,

3238
03:10:02,329 --> 03:10:04,809
it's hard to stay up past like 10, 11 o'clock.

3239
03:10:05,450 --> 03:10:06,569
For those of you that stuck around,

3240
03:10:07,129 --> 03:10:08,489
I hope it didn't mess your sleep schedule up.

3241
03:10:08,489 --> 03:10:10,489
And thanks for watching and maybe we'll see you again.

3242
03:10:11,129 --> 03:10:12,889
If you got some time, maybe we'll see you Monday.

3243
03:10:13,690 --> 03:10:15,950
Good night.

3244
03:10:16,510 --> 03:10:18,360
Have a good sleep.

3245
03:10:19,000 --> 03:10:20,409
Call your mother.

3246
03:10:20,409 --> 03:10:23,020
We'll see you later.

3247
03:10:28,809 --> 03:10:31,370
Take care of yourselves and goodbye.
