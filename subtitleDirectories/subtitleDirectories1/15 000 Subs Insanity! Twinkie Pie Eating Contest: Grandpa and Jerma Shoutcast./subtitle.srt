00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,169
Hey, what's going on guys? Jerma here. I want to welcome you to the 15,000 subscriber.

2
00:00:14,169 --> 00:00:20,660
I don't even know what you call this. This is not really a video. It's a video, but this is not a skit.

3
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,839
Really, it's more of a real life happening, I guess you could say.

4
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:28,839
We have Burger Boy who's standing right here. He's pretty much naked, so he can't like come into frame.

5
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:30,839
But I'll just say something. Say hello.

6
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:37,600
So what's going to happen in this video is there's going to be a Twinkie eating contest.

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,600
And then right after it, there's going to be a pie eating contest.

8
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,840
Both between Burger Boy and Exoskeleton Bug Millennium Boy.

9
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,840
So bear with us here. This is going to be pretty gross.

10
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,840
I won't recommend that you have like small children that are eating.

11
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:59,020
If you happen to be eating something, I would put it to the side for a second because this is disgusting.

12
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:03,020
So I hope you guys enjoy this. I'm going to be shout casting the whole thing.

13
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,189
So we'll see how it goes. See you in a second.

14
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,310
So welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the 15,000 subscriber video.

15
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,310
I am Anthony Wimbledon sitting alongside here with Grandpa.

16
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,310
We're going to go over the contestants for a little bit.

17
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,310
Grandpa, first introduce yourself.

18
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,310
I just want to say hello and welcome to the video.

19
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,310
This is going to be a crazy, extraordinary thing.

20
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,310
And these guys are gross, by the way. Can I just say that?

21
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:30,310
I think a lot of people potentially are thinking the same thing, Grandpa.

22
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:35,310
Okay, so first up here we have Burger Boy, who is a longtime champion of the eating events.

23
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,310
He holds seven world records for eating cheeseburgers.

24
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,310
And he is on the World Health Organization's list of potential threats.

25
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,310
Ladies and gentlemen, Burger Boy.

26
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,870
But we also have another competitor, Exoskeleton Bug Millennium Boy.

27
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,870
He has been doing a lot of trash talking prior to this competition.

28
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,870
All he wants to do is talk about Burger Boy and how fat he is and how stupid he is.

29
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,870
But we will see at the end of this competition if that's going to be true.

30
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,870
So let's get down to the floor here now. I guess I'm getting into my ear.

31
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,870
We're getting an interview here with Exoskeleton Bug Millennium Boy.

32
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:08,240
He's got something to say about Burger Boy. Let's get down there.

33
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,240
The Exoskeleton Bug body takes on the Burger Boy.

34
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,240
Here's how I'm going to win. The Burger Boy eats burgers, not Twinkies.

35
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,240
Boom. Shut down. Wasted.

36
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,240
He actually has quite a point there. Burger Boy looks a little stunned.

37
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,240
But what do you say we get this started, Grandpa? We're going to shell-cast this one, baby.

38
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,240
Get the countdown ready even though we're not going to keep any time.

39
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,240
That is really stupid.

40
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,240
But we're going to start this off right now. One to one right now.

41
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,240
Both of them shoving those down their throats. Burger Boy gets the upper hand with two now.

42
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,240
I mean, does this guy really think he's going to win this contest?

43
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,240
This guy's like ten times bigger than you. Are you fucking stupid?

44
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,240
Yep.

45
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,240
You can't win this. You're not going to win.

46
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,240
You are right though, Grandpa. He does have the weight advantage.

47
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,240
And he also has the eating advantage. He has multiple championships.

48
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,240
Millennium Boy has done pretty much absolutely nothing in his entire life.

49
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,240
So I can understand where you're coming from.

50
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:56,240
Also too, you'd really need to take into consideration the fact that the big fat guy over there...

51
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,240
Burger Boy, you mean? Yep.

52
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:03,240
Well, Burger Boy, he's a strong bastard. He could probably pick you up and throw you.

53
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:08,240
So even if he loses this fight tonight, he'll probably kick his ass.

54
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,240
And I'll probably want to watch that too.

55
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,240
And hopefully the cameraman gets that on camera.

56
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,240
That would be pretty interesting to say the least.

57
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,240
But right now, six to five. And Burger Boy seems to be losing his composure right now.

58
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,240
I thought what he just saw was really funny.

59
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,240
Actually, he's going to lose if he doesn't cut the shit.

60
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,240
Look at the inside of his mouth. That's disgusting.

61
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,240
Six to six now. Burger Boy trying to find his composure.

62
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,240
It is now tied up at the sixes.

63
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,240
Burger Boy now finds it. He gets one in there very quickly.

64
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,240
Now seven to six, Burger Boy.

65
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,479
And something that a lot of people don't understand is...

66
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:40,479
Twinkies are an incredibly dense snack.

67
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,479
150 calories per Twinkie and a ton of sugar.

68
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,479
Yet someone's definitely going to puke. Oh jeez.

69
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:51,479
If somebody doesn't puke, I will pay everybody six...

70
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:57,719
I will pay a dollar to charity if somebody doesn't puke.

71
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:59,719
Well, that's very noble of you, Grandpa. Very noble.

72
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:01,719
But it looks like we're starting to see a slowdown here.

73
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:04,719
Nine to seven. Oh, and listen to that.

74
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,719
He's got some choice words for him.

75
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,719
He's only up by one point though, trying to get a little overconfident there.

76
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:11,719
Yeah, he better watch that because I've done that before.

77
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,719
It came back to bite me right on the balls.

78
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,719
I said to some guy at the bus stop, I said,

79
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:18,720
Hey, can I see your newspaper for a second?

80
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,720
And he said, No, it's mine.

81
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,720
And then I got arrested for assault.

82
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,720
And I'm not sure where that was going.

83
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,720
But don't be mean to people.

84
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,720
That's the moral of the story.

85
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
Okay, that's fantastic.

86
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,720
But now we've got 11 to eight here.

87
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
Both of them slowing down immensely.

88
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,720
11 to nine now.

89
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,899
I think this is going to be the end here.

90
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:36,899
They're both stopping.

91
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:40,139
I don't see any more activity between either Burger Boy.

92
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:41,139
Let's go down to the field.

93
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:42,139
Let's find out what's going on down there.

94
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:45,139
The brick wall is there.

95
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:48,889
Heard it from Burger Boy himself hitting the brick wall.

96
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,889
Both of them are now conceding this match.

97
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:51,889
It is 11 to nine.

98
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:53,889
Burger Boy is your victor.

99
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:56,889
I mean, is that really a surprise to anybody that's watching this right now?

100
00:04:56,889 --> 00:04:57,889
Probably not.

101
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:00,889
But let's go down to Jeremy, AKA me.

102
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:02,889
And I'll announce the winner.

103
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:08,540
So, ladies and gentlemen, the winner of the Twinkie eating competition,

104
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,970
Burger Boy.

105
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:14,959
What?

106
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,959
That's why I said you filmed it.

107
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,959
I didn't know you were going to do that either.

108
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:21,959
What did you just do?

109
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:22,959
I thought you were going to wait.

110
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,959
Wait, what?

111
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,959
So this is going to be just a bonus clip.

112
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,959
They decided to do a pie eating contest as well.

113
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:34,959
And as you can see here, they are both just disgusting human beings eating like a pig out of a trough.

114
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,959
And Burger Boy starts off very, very well.

115
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,959
But Exoskeleton Bug Millennium Boy does pretty well.

116
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:40,959
He keeps up pretty much the whole time.

117
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:42,959
We're going to go in for some live stuff in a second here.

118
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:47,959
But I just want to take this opportunity to thank every single person that has subscribed to the channel.

119
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:51,959
15,000 subscribers is mind boggling, guys.

120
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,959
So thank you all so, so much.

121
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:54,959
It means a hell of a lot to me.

122
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,959
You guys rock everybody.

123
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,959
So take care, guys.

124
00:05:58,959 --> 00:05:59,959
I'll see you all soon.

125
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,959
And I'll leave you with the ending.

126
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:02,959
It was pretty funny.

127
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:05,959
So here's the ending of the pie eating contest.

128
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,959
Take care, everybody.

129
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:11,800
The crust is like stuck to the bottom.

130
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,980
Scrape it.

131
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,980
Scrape it?

132
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,209
Scrape it.

133
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:20,209
Scrape it.

134
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:21,209
Oh, fuck.

135
00:06:21,209 --> 00:06:22,209
What is this stuff?

136
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:27,379
Oh, man.

137
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:34,490
Your winner, again, Burger Boy.

138
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,100
Oh, I won a pie eating contest when I was like a kid.

139
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,100
At like summer camp.

140
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,100
Everyone was like, oh, I didn't eat all day.

141
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,100
Even like, oh, the fat kids.

142
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,100
And then, oh, I won.

143
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,100
I beat them all.

144
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,100
I was like a little guy.

145
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,100
Oh, what happened now?

146
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,100
You lost.
