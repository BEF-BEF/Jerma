1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:11,820
Okay, so guys, welcome to Binding of Isaac, my playthrough, or my first one, I guess.

2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:18,969
Ooh, I got the eye, the pinky eye. I forget what this thing does.

3
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,679
TF2 would not work. I couldn't get it to- I couldn't stream it for some reason.

4
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:31,379
It was all laggy and glitchy and crazy, and I couldn't do anything about it.

5
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:37,060
I'm gonna have to figure out why that's happening, because that's not good at all.

6
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:45,380
Not at all. You have nothing for me. I didn't really find anything besides the

7
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:53,030
chance to do poison. That's pretty sick. I don't have any bombs or anything. Looks like we're just gonna go fight the boss.

8
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,140
Kane versus Pin. All right, Pin, what you got?

9
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:06,450
You ain't got nothing on me, buddy. I see the one that just kind of jumps out. It's, uh, it's that agreement right there. Cool.

10
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,849
Cool, cool, cool.

11
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:11,370
Bully!

12
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,569
Ow!

13
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:19,879
No, I wish Burger Boy was in this game as a playable character.

14
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:24,099
Whoa!

15
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:30,310
Why am I not hitting him?

16
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,310
He just killed himself.

17
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,450
What a stupid bastard.

18
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,060
Ding ding, ding ding, ding ding ding ding ding, let's go.

19
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:47,340
The basement, too.

20
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:56,219
You know, how I'm not playing as Isaac? So I don't have the bomb, the luxury of having like, the bombs.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:09,530
Get out of here. Get out of here! Boop boop boop. Actually, I gotta plug my headphones in. That's one thing I didn't do.

22
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:19,659
Headphones, you're in. And, oh, are you sure you want to do this? Yes, I'm sure. I'm as sure as I'm gonna be.

23
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,419
Aren't I? Let's go!

24
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:36,150
How do you record games with fraps? F9, I think, is by default.

25
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:46,039
The Book of Shadows, I love this thing. This gives you a shield when you hit space.

26
00:02:46,039 --> 00:03:00,020
Any bombs? Envy! Oh, Envy.

27
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:07,270
Envy's got nothing on me. Envy's got nothing on you.

28
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:12,750
Oh, and for future reference, if you're watching this on YouTube,

29
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,750
and I'm responding to random questions on the stream.

30
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,560
So I'm not talking to Burger Boy, or he's not here with me.

31
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,560
Otto's not in the room with me.

32
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,560
So, Otto, what do you think about fraps, like in F9?

33
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:39,120
This is Wrath of the Lamb. Wrath of the Lamb DLC.

34
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:46,080
Excuse me, sir.

35
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,389
I love the noise those guys make.

36
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:58,979
TF2 is not going to start, unfortunately.

37
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:05,979
I have to do some bug fixes, or find out why the stream was lagging, like, incredibly.

38
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:10,280
X-Split, it was X-Split. I have no idea why.

39
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,280
It's something I have to spend some time with.

40
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,610
Question is, actually, can I put the Book of Shadows on and walk in here?

41
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,170
I bet I can, let's find out.

42
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:24,860
Oh, absolutely I can. Oh, baby, look at that.

43
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,860
And pills, I'm Kane, taking the pills would be good.

44
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,860
Tears up, hell yeah.

45
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,040
And what's this going to be?

46
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,040
Health up. Look, and you know what? I'm going to get hurt right here.

47
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:49,939
It was worth it. Totally worth it. Totally worth it.

48
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:54,819
Yeah, the YouTube chat is not really ideal.

49
00:04:54,819 --> 00:05:00,819
When you write a message, let's say like five people write a message at the same time,

50
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:05,819
it kind of puts everything in a queue, and spams it after like two minutes.

51
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:13,500
It's very weird.

52
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,500
Da da da da da.

53
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,959
Secret room, baby.

54
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,959
Oh, that's a dime. That's a dime.

55
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:29,879
Okay, now I'm going to go in the coin room.

56
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:37,310
Going in that coin room.

57
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,480
Let's see.

58
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,620
Alright, this is a bunch of pills, I think, isn't it?

59
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,860
That's the coin purse.

60
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,019
I think that's the coin purse.

61
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:52,019
Yup, oh my god, and look at this.

62
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:55,019
I'm going to buy these pills over here, too.

63
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:57,839
This is going to be insane.

64
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,269
Bombs are key.

65
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:03,829
What's this one? Health up. Health up again.

66
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:06,069
Oh my god.

67
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:08,069
What is this?

68
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:10,069
Balls. Look at this, guys.

69
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:12,069
And I'm going to buy this, too.

70
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:14,069
Whatever this is, it's going to be good.

71
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:16,069
Oh, we're going to be teleport pills.

72
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:20,069
Yeah, Kane, if you have any pills when you're playing with Kane,

73
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:22,069
then you'll never get bad pills, ever.

74
00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:25,139
There's health in that room, I want it.

75
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,139
And I want this, too.

76
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:30,339
What? What just happened?

77
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:33,329
What the hell was that?

78
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:35,329
Alright, I just put a bomb down right here,

79
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:38,329
moved over and put up, and then looked over at the chat,

80
00:06:38,329 --> 00:06:40,329
and then I got hurt.

81
00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:42,329
What just happened?

82
00:06:42,329 --> 00:06:44,329
Did the bomb come up with me? Did the fly hit it?

83
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:46,699
What the hell was that?

84
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:49,899
Oh.

85
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:51,899
I looked over at the chat, like, what are people saying?

86
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:55,160
Dang, I get hurt.

87
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,160
I wanted to open this. Oh.

88
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,819
Come on, now.

89
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:03,819
The reason why I'm not streaming on Twitch anymore

90
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:06,819
is because I get 720 on YouTube.

91
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:09,250
I'm not partnered on Twitch.

92
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:13,480
Because I have a contract with Machinima

93
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,480
that makes it so I can stream on here.

94
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,420
I can't believe I didn't get that.

95
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:24,899
I can't believe I did not get that item.

96
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:28,610
I'm an idiot.

97
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,879
Get away from me.

98
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,879
Alright, so it looks like we got some fruit punch right here,

99
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:36,879
some Hi-C ecto cooler.

100
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:39,879
If anyone knows what that is, you get plus 20 German points.

101
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:44,100
Yeah, that right there,

102
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,100
that green stuff right here is ecto cooler.

103
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,100
Hi-C ecto cooler.

104
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,399
The rest is fruit punch.

105
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:56,720
Let's keep going.

106
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,040
Pinkie eye.

107
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,040
Oh, God.

108
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,040
Why do they have to have such big tears?

109
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,069
Okay, I got the book of shadow again.

110
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:14,480
I got the book of shadows.

111
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:20,120
I need bombs.

112
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,509
I need bombs bad.

113
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:27,029
Get away from me.

114
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:36,480
A nickel.

115
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,480
These guys can't do anything.

116
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,480
I don't want to get myself hurt.

117
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,980
Curve the bullet like in wanted.

118
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,159
Oh, come on.

119
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:47,399
You're better than this, Jerma.

120
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,399
I miss you every single time.

121
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:53,090
Oh, God.

122
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,090
Where's Boo?

123
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,330
Boo.

124
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,330
BooMan61 is my binding of Isaac.

125
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,529
My binding of Isaac buddy.

126
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:04,529
He tells me all these things I need to know.

127
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:10,159
Pinkie eye or match stick?

128
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:17,009
I think I'm going to stick with pinkie eye.

129
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:19,009
So wait, the 720 stream is bad?

130
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:21,009
Is that what you guys are saying?

131
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:23,190
The 720p stream is not good?

132
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,620
That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

133
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,620
I don't understand why.

134
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,690
Whole lot of weird stuff going on in today's stream.

135
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,690
I don't know what's going on here.

136
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:36,600
Boom.

137
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,590
Yeah, you got nothing, Sloth.

138
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,590
Sorry, Sloth.

139
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,850
But you dead.

140
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:52,899
Favorite class in TF2 is the engineer.

141
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:54,899
Yeah, I just want...

142
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:58,100
No, I don't want that.

143
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,100
The book of shadows, because the book of shadows is really good.

144
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,679
I got my fly buddy

145
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,679
flying with me.

146
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:07,679
He's going to bend the knee and...

147
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:09,679
Wait, where is he? Oh, yeah, that's right.

148
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:11,679
He comes out randomly when I shoot people.

149
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:15,970
That's an amazing item, by the way.

150
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,970
Me and my fly

151
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,529
going to fly away

152
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:24,049
to the end of time.

153
00:10:24,049 --> 00:10:26,049
Oh, no, mini greens. Book of shadows.

154
00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:28,049
I had to. I'm not losing all my money.

155
00:10:28,049 --> 00:10:30,679
These guys are shooting at me.

156
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:32,679
Get out of my face.

157
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:38,360
Ha ha.

158
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,360
Well, the resolution has nothing to do with

159
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,360
the chat.

160
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,360
It's just the YouTube chat is

161
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,360
bad.

162
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,360
I'm not going to sugarcoat it.

163
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,360
The YouTube streaming chat

164
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:57,379
is not so good.

165
00:10:57,379 --> 00:11:04,740
Ugh.

166
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,740
I hate these enemies. When you get in a room with these guys

167
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,740
and there's more than three or four of them,

168
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,740
say your prayers,

169
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,110
because they are so annoying.

170
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,950
I don't have any money.

171
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,950
Test tomorrow, dude. I forget your name.

172
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,950
I went by way too fast.

173
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,950
Good luck on your test. Anybody who has a test.

174
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,950
Good luck on your finals.

175
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,950
If you already had them, I hope you aced them.

176
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,950
And if you haven't had them yet, then

177
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,950
go in there and sack them silly.

178
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,639
Metaphorically.

179
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:38,559
I'm going in here.

180
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:41,759
Get me some items.

181
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:43,759
Ooh.

182
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:45,759
Oh, big problem.

183
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:47,759
Oh, big problem.

184
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:49,759
Triple shot, baby.

185
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:51,759
I killed plenty of birds.

186
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:54,840
Look at that.

187
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,840
This could be a good playthrough

188
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:01,059
if I'm not an idiot.

189
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:03,059
Oh, like that.

190
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:05,059
I thought I could hide behind the thing and move.

191
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:09,990
But there was a rock in front of me.

192
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,990
I need to open this.

193
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,289
There might be hearts in there.

194
00:12:14,289 --> 00:12:19,600
I need to.

195
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:31,000
No, but there's a nickel.

196
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Across the pond in Wales. That's a far away.

197
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
That's a far away away.

198
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,259
Ooh, the battery.

199
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:40,950
Look at it out of my head. How gruesome.

200
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,950
Alright, I got a lot of good items,

201
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,950
but not a whole lot of health right now.

202
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,950
I cannot screw this up.

203
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,950
I really need to, like, pay attention and not die.

204
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,950
Because that would be so bad.

205
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:55,169
Alright, I got everything I need.

206
00:12:55,169 --> 00:12:57,669
Can't get to the secret room.

207
00:12:57,669 --> 00:12:59,840
I don't have any bombs.

208
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,840
I am not going to do TF2 again today.

209
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,840
Because it's just...

210
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,840
I don't want to have to do the headache.

211
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,720
I'll have to try and test it out later.

212
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,179
Alright, husk.

213
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:14,179
This is not going to be easy.

214
00:13:14,179 --> 00:13:17,570
Try hard mode.

215
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:20,389
Have to, like, pay attention to only the game.

216
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:22,389
Just for fun, I'm turning it on.

217
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:25,269
I don't want a chance to bump right into him.

218
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:27,570
Come on, bump across, baby.

219
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:33,200
Alright, we're good to go.

220
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,539
What is this? Eight ball?

221
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:39,539
Oh.

222
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:41,539
It gave me, like, a rag on my head.

223
00:13:41,539 --> 00:13:44,549
What the hell?

224
00:13:44,549 --> 00:13:48,129
I am the magician.

225
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:50,129
Alright, doesn't the magician take you to the secret room?

226
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,129
No, he doesn't.

227
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:56,100
No, he doesn't.

228
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,100
This game is not free.

229
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:03,909
It's pretty cheap, though.

230
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,909
This game is only

231
00:14:05,909 --> 00:14:07,909
five dollars on Steam.

232
00:14:07,909 --> 00:14:10,850
Actually, isn't there a sale going on for it right now?

233
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:16,480
Or is the sale over?

234
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,480
Yeah, the no damage achievements, I don't know, man.

235
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,480
I don't think I could ever get those.

236
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,679
Because you'll get so confident,

237
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:25,679
you'll get to the end of a level and be like,

238
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:27,679
I got this in the bag.

239
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:30,120
And then you just die.

240
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,120
Oh my god, I got rage now.

241
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,610
As long as I play this safe,

242
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,610
I will beat this whole game right now.

243
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:40,710
I can't be stupid about this, though.

244
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,710
I gotta be smart. I gotta be smooth.

245
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:45,779
Oh, god.

246
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:50,580
The liberty cap is a random

247
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,950
mushroom

248
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,950
every room.

249
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,950
And this is a chance to have poison.

250
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,950
I think I'm gonna stick with the mushroom, guys.

251
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,950
Because I want those random mushroom achievement thingies.

252
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:08,629
Achievement, what am I talking about?

253
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:10,629
Yeah, I see I got a massive, like, speed increase now.

254
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:12,629
And, like, I'm kinda just little.

255
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:15,000
Is my mind playing a trick on me?

256
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,620
Or is this just damage?

257
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:23,059
I think it's just damage. I'm not going in there.

258
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:27,090
Screw that.

259
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,090
Exam tips? Well, good luck on your exams.

260
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,090
I actually made an exam tip video.

261
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:33,519
Did you, uh,

262
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,519
did you check that out?

263
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,519
Look at how little I am.

264
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,529
Hey, look, I'm tiny.

265
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:42,529
Get away from me.

266
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:45,919
There we go.

267
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:50,210
That's what I'm talking about.

268
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,210
It was a spy video from, I think, like a month ago.

269
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:55,730
How you see damage? I wish you could see damage in this game.

270
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,730
It'd be an interesting feature.

271
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:00,870
Little numbers popping up over everybody's heads.

272
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:05,669
Oh, what's that?

273
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:07,669
What's that do? I don't know.

274
00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:10,289
Whatever. I don't want it. Pride.

275
00:16:10,289 --> 00:16:14,769
Get away from me, Pride.

276
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:16,769
Get away from me, Pride.

277
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:19,909
Oh!

278
00:16:19,909 --> 00:16:21,909
He's doing it too often.

279
00:16:21,909 --> 00:16:23,909
I can't, will you do the other move?

280
00:16:23,909 --> 00:16:27,169
Wow, he didn't do the

281
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:29,169
he didn't do the other move once.

282
00:16:29,169 --> 00:16:31,539
What a son of a bastard.

283
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:34,740
I forget what the Emperor card does.

284
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,740
Boo! Boo!

285
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,840
I need your help, Boo!

286
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,840
Anytime I'm in a Skype call with Boo, I'll just say an item

287
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,840
and he'll go

288
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,840
Oh, that does

289
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,840
plus 25 damage.

290
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,480
And I'll go, thanks, Boo.

291
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,480
I don't know what it does.

292
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:01,570
But I'm gonna keep it.

293
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,570
I have faced Super Greed. He's a pain in the ass.

294
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:07,089
He's a super pain

295
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:09,089
How did I not get hit right there?

296
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:11,650
Don't ask me how I did not

297
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,650
get hit. I have no idea.

298
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:17,039
I need that heart.

299
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:24,980
Take that and I'm gonna get this

300
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,500
heart because I need it.

301
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:35,779
Woohoo!

302
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:37,779
Boo does have quite a sexy

303
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:39,779
voice, I will tell you. It is true.

304
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:44,319
I can't get these bombs!

305
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:48,480
Teleports you to the boss room.

306
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,480
Good to know. Thanks a lot, dude.

307
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,480
Good to know. Oh, I'm turning

308
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:59,079
this on because I need it. Do I have

309
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,319
enough money for anything? Let's find

310
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:04,390
out.

311
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:08,230
I'm gonna get it. It's always good to have.

312
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,230
And Steam Sale, I...

313
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,230
Probably should

314
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,230
have tried to find the secret room to get the

315
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:18,450
Steam Sale. I think it's gonna be

316
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,009
right here.

317
00:18:21,009 --> 00:18:23,380
Oh!

318
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,619
Yeah!

319
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:29,400
99 bombs.

320
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,750
That makes me happy.

321
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,750
Now I'm gonna go blow up every

322
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,119
damn thing in

323
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:40,119
the item room down here.

324
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,869
Well, not the gambling room.

325
00:18:42,869 --> 00:18:47,160
Hey, what's going on?

326
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,160
I love your little casino here. Everybody

327
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,160
is gonna...

328
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:55,319
I'm gonna kill myself.

329
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:57,319
I just tried to make a joke right there

330
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:59,319
and my brain is too dumb to be able to

331
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:01,319
make a joke and do my joke at the same

332
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:03,319
time.

333
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:09,640
Whatever.

334
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,480
Let's go boss room.

335
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,430
bossfight.com.edu.

336
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:25,509
Cain versus Fistula.

337
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:29,089
This can...

338
00:19:29,089 --> 00:19:31,089
You know what? I need to start dropping some tactical

339
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:33,400
bombs. This guy can

340
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,680
be a real pain in the butt.

341
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,680
Oh god! That was some dodging

342
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,680
right there! Oh my god!

343
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,990
How did I do that?

344
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,990
Alright.

345
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,059
Okay.

346
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:53,410
Juicy juice. Jesus juice.

347
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:59,279
Pretty cool. I'm good to go.

348
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:01,970
Ah!

349
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,400
I apologize for the coughing.

350
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,519
I'm still sick. Full health.

351
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:12,079
You know what that means.

352
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:19,880
Oh, get away from me.

353
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,880
That was a collateral right there.

354
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,740
Oh god!

355
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,299
Thank you for saving me.

356
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:31,480
Book of Shadows. Appreciate it.

357
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,960
Okay.

358
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,960
That's another situation

359
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,960
where I hit E

360
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,960
right here to drop

361
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,960
the bomb. I moved over here, looked at

362
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,960
the chat, and I would have just gotten hurt

363
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,960
because I wasn't paying...

364
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,579
Alright, let's not do that again.

365
00:20:50,579 --> 00:20:52,579
What? Oh.

366
00:20:52,579 --> 00:20:55,200
Why did...

367
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,529
Why did that not work?

368
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:00,839
Okay, that's good to know that

369
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:03,460
that's here.

370
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,460
Why did that not work? Flies, get out of the way!

371
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,460
You're ruining everything.

372
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:14,289
Thank you.

373
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:16,289
If I find one of those blood donation machines, I'm going to

374
00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:25,890
use the hell out of it.

375
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,890
There's nothing I can do to get away from that.

376
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:32,819
I hate...

377
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:35,890
I hate these enemies.

378
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,890
If there's one enemy I hate in the game...

379
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,890
Okay, I gotta be quiet. I need to try odd now.

380
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:46,549
Oh, I'll take it for sure.

381
00:21:46,549 --> 00:22:00,609
It's a trap!

382
00:22:00,609 --> 00:22:02,609
Let's go. Another room with these stupid

383
00:22:02,609 --> 00:22:04,609
brain bastards. I hate

384
00:22:04,609 --> 00:22:07,750
these guys. You know what?

385
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,750
Everyone just blow up right in here.

386
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:14,019
Thank you.

387
00:22:14,019 --> 00:22:16,019
Some might call that a waste. I call it

388
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:28,289
a journey. Oh.

389
00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:34,480
Okay.

390
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,480
I think the secret room is... Oh, no!

391
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,480
No!

392
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,299
You know what? Everyone, come here.

393
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:43,299
Let's all have a family picnic. Come stand

394
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:46,559
right next to me.

395
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,059
That's how I deal with those guys.

396
00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:54,180
I got plenty of bombs. Oh, great.

397
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,509
Greed. It's alright.

398
00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:01,799
It's just regular greed. He's a wuss.

399
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,799
It's just regular greed. Don't worry.

400
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:09,430
Give me that money, and give me your key.

401
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:18,440
Oh!

402
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:27,079
Get away!

403
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:29,380
I'm not going in there. Those rooms always

404
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,380
give me trouble. I always die.

405
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,319
How do you shoot at an angle?

406
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:36,319
So, when I hit up, and I move to the

407
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:38,319
left a little bit, it kind of like

408
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:40,319
curves it. So, if you hit left and up

409
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:42,319
kind of at the same time, you'll curve

410
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:44,819
your bullets. Like, bling, bling.

411
00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:48,849
You can do it any direction, too.

412
00:23:48,849 --> 00:23:50,849
It doesn't have to be up or down. See, I can do

413
00:23:50,849 --> 00:24:01,920
it left and right, too.

414
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,920
I think I'm going to be alright. If I can get some more

415
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,920
health up, I should be able to kill Mom's

416
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:10,019
Heart. For sure.

417
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:12,019
Oh, oh, okay, okay, okay. I won't do

418
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:15,990
this. Don't worry.

419
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:20,019
I promise you, I'm not crazy.

420
00:24:20,019 --> 00:24:22,019
This room, if you don't know, because this is Wrath of the Lamb.

421
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:24,019
This is Added in Wrath of the Lamb.

422
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:26,019
When I walk over this, it hurts me.

423
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:28,019
For a heart. But, it has a chance

424
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:30,019
that it's going to drop something good in the room.

425
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:32,019
So, I'm going to keep doing it.

426
00:24:32,019 --> 00:24:34,019
Come on, keep hurting me.

427
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:38,880
I know you want to give me something.

428
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,150
Oh, fine.

429
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:44,150
Because now, I can just go all the way over here

430
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,150
and go back to that room where all those hearts were.

431
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,640
And...

432
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,440
I'm fine.

433
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,279
What? What? What?

434
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,279
What? What? What? What?

435
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,289
Okay.

436
00:25:04,289 --> 00:25:06,289
Oh. I almost

437
00:25:06,289 --> 00:25:08,289
just had a heart attack. I thought I could not get back

438
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:10,529
into this room.

439
00:25:10,529 --> 00:25:12,529
I would have just been so bad

440
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:22,200
right there.

441
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,009
I don't have enough for the ladder.

442
00:25:25,009 --> 00:25:31,799
I'll probably get it later. What is the Sword

443
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,799
Room? The Sword Room,

444
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,799
when you go in there, you can only go in there with full health.

445
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:38,039
And it's a...

446
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:40,039
You fight a wave of enemies.

447
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,039
Three waves of enemies.

448
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:44,039
And then after, you get to have the item that's in the room.

449
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:48,900
It's pretty cool. I don't...

450
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,900
I just never go into it because I always end up getting myself

451
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,869
killed in there. Troll Bomb,

452
00:25:54,869 --> 00:25:57,680
get away. Now I can get the ladder

453
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,680
if I want it. No!

454
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,680
Stop it. You

455
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,500
bad pets.

456
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,500
I'll go get it. Might as well

457
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,529
have it, right? Might as well own

458
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:16,869
it. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go,

459
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:20,579
go, go. I'll have you.

460
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,579
Thank you very much.

461
00:26:22,579 --> 00:26:24,579
Oh. I don't need the heart.

462
00:26:24,579 --> 00:26:28,609
Because I can go up here.

463
00:26:28,609 --> 00:26:30,609
Blue hearts are spirit hearts.

464
00:26:30,609 --> 00:26:32,920
So when I pick up a spirit heart,

465
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,920
it lasts

466
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,920
only as long as it's there.

467
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,920
See how the red hearts are there pretty much

468
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,799
permanently? The spirit hearts

469
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:43,799
are only there until they get... If I get

470
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:45,799
hurt right now, it's going to take that spirit heart away and I don't

471
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:47,799
get it back. Even if I get health.

472
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:52,529
I'm playing Bomberman right now. I feel like

473
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:57,140
I'm like spelunking. Ooh,

474
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,150
the rock. Oh, I

475
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:02,150
must be doing max damage, am I?

476
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,150
Yeah, I'm doing the maximum amount

477
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,150
of damage you can do in the game.

478
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:08,150
So that's good. That's good.

479
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:10,150
I'm stuck.

480
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,839
Oh, I got

481
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,460
stuck on the rock.

482
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:20,259
I think I have my book of shadows.

483
00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:23,589
Okay, that's Epikac.

484
00:27:23,589 --> 00:27:25,829
I don't want it. Is that

485
00:27:25,829 --> 00:27:27,829
Epikac or is that Chemical Peel?

486
00:27:27,829 --> 00:27:30,069
I don't know. I don't want it.

487
00:27:30,069 --> 00:27:32,069
I hate Epikac. Epikac

488
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:34,069
makes you shoot like those green balls and you can

489
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,069
hurt yourself with it. I always kill

490
00:27:36,069 --> 00:27:38,069
myself, guaranteed, with it every time.

491
00:27:38,069 --> 00:27:43,440
Cane versus war.

492
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,440
One of the four horsemen.

493
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,440
Oh my god, I am destroying

494
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,349
him. I am absolutely

495
00:27:51,349 --> 00:27:53,779
destroying him. Wow.

496
00:27:53,779 --> 00:27:55,779
Usually this guy takes a lot more hits than this.

497
00:27:55,779 --> 00:27:58,339
Okay, see you later, man.

498
00:27:58,339 --> 00:28:00,640
And I got a cube of meat.

499
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,640
And that's Chemical Peel? That's Chemical Peel?

500
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,799
Alright. No deal with the

501
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,799
devil. I don't want the deal with the devil.

502
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,799
Chemical Peel.

503
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,619
If that's Chemical Peel, then I will get it.

504
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:16,119
I'm so scared, but what if it's Epikac?

505
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:19,960
Alright.

506
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,960
At least a dozen people have said it's

507
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,319
not Epikac.

508
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:26,319
Oh, thank god.

509
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:31,509
This game is

510
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:33,509
so worth it.

511
00:28:33,509 --> 00:28:35,680
Somebody just asked if it's a game worth it.

512
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,680
Yeah, it's worth it. Absolutely.

513
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,500
It is probably the best game

514
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,500
I've played for under

515
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,740
twenty dollars ever.

516
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:48,069
This game is only five bucks.

517
00:28:48,069 --> 00:28:50,690
Without the sale,

518
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:53,119
the expansion and everything, I think

519
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:55,119
it's eight dollars with everything.

520
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:58,000
But, I mean, I've spent

521
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,240
more money on games

522
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,240
that I've never played than I have

523
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,609
on this. I bought Deus Ex

524
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,609
for sixty dollars, and I

525
00:29:06,609 --> 00:29:08,609
played the game for an hour and ten minutes.

526
00:29:08,609 --> 00:29:10,609
I didn't like it.

527
00:29:10,609 --> 00:29:14,839
I never heard this music before.

528
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:17,140
Actually, no, I think I have. I hate

529
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,140
these enemies. These are the worst. You have to kill their hearts.

530
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:23,559
Die!

531
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:28,210
Oh, thank you. Yeah, this game

532
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:30,210
is four dollars and ninety-nine cents

533
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:33,029
to buy it.

534
00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:35,029
I have the expansion, though, as well. I think the expansion

535
00:29:35,029 --> 00:29:37,269
is three bucks. So it's going to

536
00:29:37,269 --> 00:29:39,269
cost me eight dollars for everything. But

537
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:41,269
there's a Steam sale, I think,

538
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:43,269
still going.

539
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:45,269
You know what? I'm going to quench this once

540
00:29:45,269 --> 00:29:47,269
and for all. I'm going to just look

541
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:49,269
and see how much this is.

542
00:29:49,269 --> 00:29:51,509
View store page.

543
00:29:51,509 --> 00:29:57,700
Binding of Isaac.

544
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,700
Okay, so, the Binding, yeah, so it is

545
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,319
four ninety-nine for the Binding of

546
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:04,319
Isaac, if you can see. And then

547
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:06,559
the Wrath

548
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,559
of the Lamb DLC is

549
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,000
three bucks. So there you go.

550
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,680
The Steam sale is over on it,

551
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,880
apparently. It was over a while ago, I think.

552
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:29,220
It's a very good price.

553
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,220
The last time I spent

554
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,779
less than five dollars on a game,

555
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:35,779
or five dollars on a game, and

556
00:30:35,779 --> 00:30:37,779
I'm using this.

557
00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:40,599
Under twenty dollars, last time

558
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:42,599
I spent that and actually, like, really enjoyed

559
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:44,599
it and played for a long time, was probably

560
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:47,730
Orcs Must Die.

561
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:49,730
Orcs Must Die, I got a lot of playtime

562
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,730
out of that and the game was only fifteen bucks.

563
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:55,509
So it's, yeah, I'd say

564
00:30:55,509 --> 00:30:57,509
it's a steal at this price.

565
00:30:57,509 --> 00:31:01,349
You'll put at least thirty to fifty hours

566
00:31:01,349 --> 00:31:03,349
into this game. If you really enjoy it,

567
00:31:03,349 --> 00:31:05,349
you'll put at least thirty hours into

568
00:31:05,349 --> 00:31:11,940
it, at least. Oh,

569
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,500
Otto. Where is Otto?

570
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:21,160
My dog. And

571
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,160
oh, I didn't want to open that. I could have just blown it up.

572
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,970
I could have just blown the damn

573
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:29,039
thing up. Flatpenny.

574
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,279
No, I don't want that.

575
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:35,000
I do not want you.

576
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,940
Go! Ah!

577
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,940
Ah, what a bad place for these enemies.

578
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:43,269
At least I have this.

579
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:45,269
I would have taken so much damage right there.

580
00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:47,269
It's not even funny. I would have taken

581
00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:49,269
a thousand points. I would have died.

582
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:54,200
I probably would have died right there. Geez.

583
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,200
Oh, get away from me, you

584
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,200
jumping frog freaks.

585
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:05,920
Ah, damn it.

586
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,920
There we go. See you later.

587
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,869
Ah!

588
00:32:10,869 --> 00:32:15,279
Yeah, you know, I looked, I was looking

589
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,910
at DayZ. DayZ

590
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,910
looks pretty cool. I just, I thought it was

591
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,910
a standalone mod

592
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,910
or a standalone game.

593
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,910
Arma 2 was like fifty dollars

594
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,599
for the whole package, isn't it?

595
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:30,599
I need to drop some

596
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:34,440
cash on that.

597
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,440
You need Arma 2 and then you need Arma 2,

598
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,440
one of Arma 2's expansion packs

599
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,440
or something to be able to play it.

600
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,440
I think Arma 2 was thirty-nine or forty

601
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,440
or something. When I saw that

602
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:50,319
I was like...

603
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:52,759
I'm going this way. So Arma 2 is thirty

604
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:54,759
and then you need an expansion too, don't you?

605
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:59,750
That expansion.

606
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:04,230
Let's go, you...

607
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:07,170
Oh, you egg burger.

608
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:09,170
You know what? Let's go.

609
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:11,170
Let's fight. Come stand next to me.

610
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:14,049
We'll talk.

611
00:33:14,049 --> 00:33:23,000
I keep thinking

612
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
that...bad, bad. I can't even hit

613
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
this guy. Get out of the way, you son of a...

614
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,200
Ugh.

615
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,200
This guy is blocking the way of me shooting him.

616
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,200
Stupid son of a B-I.

617
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,200
I-I-I.

618
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:42,079
Capital I.

619
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:44,960
Everybody in this room blows up.

620
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,960
Arma 2 is free? What?

621
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:52,150
Arma 2 is...last time

622
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,150
I looked at it, Arma 2 was money.

623
00:33:54,150 --> 00:34:03,240
Diablo 3's real money auction house,

624
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,240
I have not even used it.

625
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,599
I don't

626
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:11,000
even care. I was mad

627
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
about it at first and I was kind of like

628
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
that's a little weird, but

629
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,170
it's got to help

630
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:19,170
drive the game for years.

631
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:21,480
So I'm not really

632
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:26,719
all that concerned about it.

633
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,719
Open sesame. I think I'm going to fight mom

634
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,960
here in a second. Maybe this

635
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,960
next room. Number dime.

636
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:39,809
Alright, let's go fight...

637
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:42,050
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I need to get some...

638
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:46,960
I get some coins.

639
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:52,599
I got coins.

640
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:55,599
Operation 2033

641
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,380
Metro.

642
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,380
That game's coming out with a sequel soon, aren't they?

643
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:05,139
I'll get the compass just cause I'm not

644
00:35:05,139 --> 00:35:08,280
going to be able to buy anything later.

645
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,280
Alright, let's go fight. Let's go fight

646
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,280
mom's big, fat,

647
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:20,599
disgusting leg.

648
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:25,590
Follow me. I don't want

649
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,590
to go in the sword room. It scares

650
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,590
me. Cause if I lose health

651
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,590
and I die to mom,

652
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,590
I am going to be

653
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:37,360
PO'd. Let's go

654
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,880
mom. Oh, what do you say

655
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,880
mommy dearest? Come on,

656
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,880
step on yourself. Oh, she

657
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,880
is...I'm killing her so bad.

658
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,190
Ugh.

659
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:54,309
Alright, that's fine. Go ahead, swap me. I don't care.

660
00:35:54,309 --> 00:35:57,000
And she's going to do it.

661
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Isaac.

662
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,719
Hahaha.

663
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:07,300
Isaac.

664
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,880
Let's keep going. I only got

665
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,250
two more rooms. And then maybe

666
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:15,250
I can go...I don't know if I'm going to be able to go to Shoal.

667
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,250
I don't think I've beaten the game enough times to go

668
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:20,130
to Shoal every time.

669
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:22,130
Ugh. What's that?

670
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:26,159
What's that? I want to look at it.

671
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:28,159
Cursed skull. Oh, boo.

672
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:32,070
Boo, what does this do?

673
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:34,440
Ugh, I don't know.

674
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,440
What does a cursed skull do, guys? Does anybody

675
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:44,929
know? Does anybody know?

676
00:36:44,929 --> 00:36:46,929
I need to know what it does.

677
00:36:46,929 --> 00:36:48,929
Cause if it's good, I want to keep it.

678
00:36:48,929 --> 00:36:50,929
Alright, we'll come back to it. I'll come back. It's going to

679
00:36:50,929 --> 00:36:55,480
be there. Cursed skull is bad.

680
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,480
Okay. Alright, good to know.

681
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,099
Do not get this.

682
00:37:00,099 --> 00:37:04,070
Okay.

683
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:06,070
Chest inside of a chest. Chestception.

684
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:09,780
Get away from me.

685
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:12,400
Health up. Exactly what

686
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,400
I was looking for. Oh, it's me.

687
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,400
Go get him, flies. Yeah.

688
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:24,900
The Book of Shadows is the thing that's

689
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,900
making this playthrough possible.

690
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,590
It really is.

691
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,590
Oh, go, go, go, go, go! Yes.

692
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:35,110
Um...

693
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:37,110
Lord have mercy on me. Geez.

694
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:40,309
Health up.

695
00:37:40,309 --> 00:37:43,059
Health up again.

696
00:37:43,059 --> 00:37:45,880
Oh my god. You're going to be

697
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,880
kidding me. Teleport pills. Let's just take

698
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,969
them. I'd like to thank

699
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:53,969
the Book of Shadows for making this possible

700
00:37:53,969 --> 00:37:55,969
because without him, I wouldn't be

701
00:37:55,969 --> 00:37:57,969
receiving this award and I want to thank

702
00:37:57,969 --> 00:37:59,969
my mother and my father and my parents.

703
00:37:59,969 --> 00:38:07,079
Alright, I'm not going in the secret room.

704
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:09,079
Let's take a look who's in there.

705
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:11,250
My buddy Greed.

706
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:14,320
The name's Greed.

707
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:19,570
Oh, gad.

708
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:26,019
See ya.

709
00:38:26,019 --> 00:38:28,019
If Isaac's health is brought down to half

710
00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:30,019
of a heart, Isaac is then teleported

711
00:38:30,019 --> 00:38:32,019
to the last room completed.

712
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:34,690
Um, that sounds

713
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:37,320
pretty incredible. That sounds pretty

714
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,320
ridiculous. Actually, but to be

715
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,320
honest, even if you complete the last

716
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,320
room with half a heart, when you get to the next room

717
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,320
after the last room, you're

718
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:50,369
probably going to die.

719
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:52,550
That's still pretty cool though. If I did

720
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,550
not have the mushroom, I would absolutely be taking

721
00:38:54,550 --> 00:39:00,820
that. Get out of here,

722
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:03,829
you spider.

723
00:39:03,829 --> 00:39:06,130
I never liked spiders.

724
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:11,570
Creepy-crawly. You want to thank your

725
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:13,570
mother? She tried to kill you.

726
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:15,570
This is true. This is very true.

727
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:18,070
But I have a short

728
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:20,070
term memory loss. I forgot that.

729
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:22,880
I forgot those things.

730
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,880
Get. I hate these guys.

731
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,119
These guys are annoying. I stick

732
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,119
my head up and then, no, I joke, bye, you

733
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,840
don't hit me. Yes, I will take

734
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,289
that. Every single door is

735
00:39:36,289 --> 00:39:38,289
now open down here.

736
00:39:38,289 --> 00:39:44,690
What's the game from E3 you're looking forward

737
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:47,380
to the most? Um,

738
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:51,159
I, you know, the Wii U.

739
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:53,159
The Wii U is actually

740
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:56,289
really, really cool.

741
00:39:56,289 --> 00:39:58,289
It's, it's very, very interesting.

742
00:39:58,289 --> 00:40:00,289
It's kind of like when the Wii first came out.

743
00:40:00,289 --> 00:40:02,289
It was like, what is that?

744
00:40:02,289 --> 00:40:04,719
I think I might just get it.

745
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:06,719
It looks like it could be fun.

746
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:08,719
Because the coolest thing in the entire world

747
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:10,719
with the Wii U, let me, I'll explain this.

748
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:12,719
This is the coolest thing ever.

749
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:14,719
So if you're playing on a TV

750
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:16,719
that's, and then you're like, let's say you're in your

751
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:18,719
living room. And

752
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:20,719
somebody comes in and they say, oh,

753
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:22,719
I want to, I want to, I need the TV, I want, I want to use

754
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:24,719
the TV. And you're like, dude,

755
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:26,719
I'm playing a game. You want this?

756
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:28,719
No, no, you can't take the TV. And

757
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:30,719
sometimes, I mean, back when I was younger, it

758
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,719
didn't matter how much you complained.

759
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:34,719
Or how much you wanted to, oh my

760
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:36,719
god. Or how much you wanted to

761
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:38,719
stay in the room. You had to get kicked off the TV.

762
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:40,719
With the Wii U,

763
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:42,719
it's going, they're going to make it so

764
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:44,719
when somebody kicks you off the TV,

765
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:47,030
you can just, I'm using like

766
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:49,030
my hands right now. I'm not even like, my hands aren't even on the keyboard.

767
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,030
You can, it goes to the screen.

768
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:53,030
You have like a, it's a mini TV

769
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,030
on the screen.

770
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:57,400
So let's say you get kicked off, you can

771
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,400
just play on the Wii U pad screen.

772
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,400
Like, okay, fine, you can take it. I'll go in

773
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,760
my room and play the game. That's insane.

774
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,760
That's unbelievable.

775
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,760
That is one of the coolest things, I think, of that

776
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,760
system so far, is the fact that you

777
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,760
can like, take the system

778
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,760
with you around the house.

779
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:24,309
Go to this last room. And plus,

780
00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:26,309
I mean, this might sound kind of like,

781
00:41:26,309 --> 00:41:28,309
kind of disgusting, but

782
00:41:28,309 --> 00:41:30,309
like, how, how awesome

783
00:41:30,309 --> 00:41:32,309
would that be if you were just like, you know,

784
00:41:32,309 --> 00:41:34,309
playing Super Mario 15,

785
00:41:34,309 --> 00:41:36,309
whatever comes out.

786
00:41:36,309 --> 00:41:38,309
You know, I gotta take like a dump.

787
00:41:38,309 --> 00:41:40,309
You can just like, take it

788
00:41:40,309 --> 00:41:42,980
into the bathroom.

789
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,980
I know, I know, I'm gross, I know.

790
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,670
But still, like, the possibilities

791
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,840
are, are endless.

792
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:55,409
Somebody should actually

793
00:41:55,409 --> 00:41:57,409
grab those teleport pills.

794
00:41:57,409 --> 00:41:59,840
I will. No, I, no,

795
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,840
I won't. I don't have any, I don't, I'm gonna hurt

796
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:08,559
myself if I go in there. Let's just go

797
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:13,880
fight the boss. Bang, bang.

798
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,329
Bang. The Wii U.

799
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:20,019
I don't like the name.

800
00:42:20,019 --> 00:42:22,019
That's, I wish they would change the name.

801
00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:27,969
Imagine if you dropped it

802
00:42:27,969 --> 00:42:30,659
in the toilet.

803
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:37,000
I can imagine that would be one of the worst

804
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
things to possibly happen.

805
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,070
But I guess

806
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:44,070
why, how would you drop it in the

807
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:46,690
toilet? Like, oh, whoops!

808
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:48,690
Chup-plunk!

809
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:56,179
I just

810
00:42:56,179 --> 00:42:58,179
thought of the noise they would make.

811
00:42:58,179 --> 00:43:03,480
Chup-plunk!

812
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,480
It's a big thing, man. It's a pretty big device.

813
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,739
Let's go kill

814
00:43:08,739 --> 00:43:10,739
Mom. Let's go fight Mommy Dearest.

815
00:43:10,739 --> 00:43:14,239
Oh,

816
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:16,239
God.

817
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:20,530
Get away from me. You know, I'm not

818
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:22,530
even gonna go item hunting. I'm just gonna

819
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:24,530
try and kill Mom.

820
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:26,530
Ah, a heft!

821
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:31,139
A heft! Yeah, I'm

822
00:43:31,139 --> 00:43:33,139
not going item hunting. I'm just gonna go try and

823
00:43:33,139 --> 00:43:35,320
go for the kill, I think.

824
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,320
Tears up. I think I'm at max

825
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,940
tears, too. How am I not at max

826
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:45,380
tears? Does it make any sense?

827
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,380
Oh, you know what? You only live once.

828
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:51,090
Yeah, you're gonna kill me. Sorry, buddy.

829
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:53,719
Neither is your friend over here.

830
00:43:53,719 --> 00:44:00,039
I live.

831
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:02,530
We you.

832
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:04,840
Oh, God!

833
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,909
The noises I make when I play

834
00:44:07,909 --> 00:44:09,909
this game really surprises me.

835
00:44:09,909 --> 00:44:14,320
I got back to 99 bombs. Are you kidding

836
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,650
me? Everybody blows up.

837
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:23,719
Boom, boom. Alright.

838
00:44:23,719 --> 00:44:28,179
Good to go. No, I did

839
00:44:28,179 --> 00:44:30,179
not take the brimstone from the devil.

840
00:44:30,179 --> 00:44:32,179
For a very important reason.

841
00:44:32,179 --> 00:44:34,550
Because brimstone,

842
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:36,550
that would have taken two hearts away. And if I

843
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:38,550
get to go to shoal,

844
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:41,170
I'm gonna want those two hearts.

845
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:43,170
And I'm doing so much damage

846
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:45,170
right now. It doesn't even matter at this point.

847
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:47,170
I have a very, very, very, very, very

848
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:49,170
good setup. So I think I'm okay.

849
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:52,820
I'll get hit by a big

850
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:59,480
rotten tooth. Double

851
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,420
gluttony. Double gluttony!

852
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:05,110
No! Get away from me!

853
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:08,630
Get away from me, gluttony!

854
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:10,630
Will you just die?

855
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:12,630
That's all I ask.

856
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:15,250
I just ask of you to be dead.

857
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:19,730
That's all I ask.

858
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:25,159
Get...

859
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:27,159
Oh, that guy. I almost got a tooth collateral.

860
00:45:27,159 --> 00:45:29,329
Only in The Binding of Isaac can you say

861
00:45:29,329 --> 00:45:31,329
the words tooth collateral.

862
00:45:31,329 --> 00:45:33,329
And have it make sense.

863
00:45:33,329 --> 00:45:37,679
You know what? I'm going the other way.

864
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:39,679
I'm ending this. I'm literally

865
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:41,679
ending this right now.

866
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:44,239
I'm going into the...

867
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:46,420
I'm ending this like I'm going into...

868
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:48,420
Oh god, I can't even talk.

869
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:54,239
Go! Go!

870
00:45:54,239 --> 00:46:00,900
Alright, I'm not gonna go the other way.

871
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,900
I'm just going to fight her.

872
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,900
I'm going to fight her.

873
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:08,739
She's got nothing on me.

874
00:46:08,739 --> 00:46:15,199
And... who's in here?

875
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:19,539
Get...

876
00:46:19,539 --> 00:46:27,280
Dude, what's the Super Meat Boy challenge?

877
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,280
Ooh, I can...

878
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,280
Alright, the real goal here is to...

879
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,280
Oh god! No, I'm gonna kill him!

880
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,780
No!

881
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:37,780
I always do that, man.

882
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:39,780
I do that way too often.

883
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,780
Hold on, I gotta text.

884
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:52,579
Alright. Text complete.

885
00:46:52,579 --> 00:46:59,360
Jerma, turn around. The treasure room

886
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,360
can only be one room away over there.

887
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,369
And... let's...

888
00:47:04,369 --> 00:47:08,150
Oh, that has to be right here.

889
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:11,969
You are absolutely right, my friend.

890
00:47:11,969 --> 00:47:13,969
Good eyes. But I guess at this point

891
00:47:13,969 --> 00:47:15,969
if I kill Mom right here

892
00:47:15,969 --> 00:47:18,210
then... and I don't go to Shoal

893
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,210
then it's over anyways.

894
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:22,210
What? What's this? What the hell is this?

895
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:24,210
What is that?

896
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:27,199
It lives?

897
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:29,199
Who is this guy?

898
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:31,889
What? What?

899
00:47:31,889 --> 00:47:34,960
Is that like a different version of

900
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,960
Mom's heart?

901
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,719
Oh no.

902
00:47:39,719 --> 00:47:41,719
Oh no, I can't fight those things.

903
00:47:41,719 --> 00:47:44,340
Oh, okay, I'm good.

904
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:46,340
Oh, did you see that, like, ricochet?

905
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:50,679
Let's go, it lives.

906
00:47:50,679 --> 00:47:52,679
Don't you know it's impolite to text during a live stream?

907
00:47:52,679 --> 00:47:54,679
That's true, but...

908
00:47:54,679 --> 00:47:56,679
Oh my god!

909
00:47:56,679 --> 00:47:59,679
It was my mother!

910
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:01,679
Oh god! I'm so scared!

911
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:03,920
I'm freaking out!

912
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,550
I'm gonna do it! I did it!

913
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:10,550
I did it!

914
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:12,550
Yeah! Yeah, yeah.

915
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:15,239
Hey, yeah. It was my mother.

916
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:17,860
Alright, um...

917
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,860
Looks like I'm not gonna be able to go to Shoal.

918
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:22,679
A poop!

919
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:24,849
Oh, I finally

920
00:48:24,849 --> 00:48:27,349
unlocked that guy.

921
00:48:27,349 --> 00:48:29,909
Took me long enough. Cause I played

922
00:48:29,909 --> 00:48:32,320
Isaac. What? What?

923
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,079
What's going on? What?

924
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:38,130
What? Oh dear

925
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:40,559
goodness. I made

926
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:42,869
it to heaven.

927
00:48:42,869 --> 00:48:47,909
Okay.

928
00:48:47,909 --> 00:48:51,750
Um...

929
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:53,750
Oh god, I am scared right now.

930
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:56,440
This is the first time I've ever done this.

931
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,929
No!

932
00:48:58,929 --> 00:49:00,929
No, no, I gotta blow...

933
00:49:00,929 --> 00:49:02,929
No! No, I'm freaking out way too much!

934
00:49:02,929 --> 00:49:04,929
Slow down. Alright.

935
00:49:04,929 --> 00:49:08,710
Oh my god, he's gonna kill me!

936
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:13,000
I gotta get rid of all this stuff in the room.

937
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
This is the problem right here.

938
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,710
God, what a mess.

939
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:25,090
I can't...

940
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:29,250
What's... There's no health bar

941
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:32,320
left. Get out of here. Get...

942
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,320
Get away from me!

943
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:38,099
Oh, a chest inside

944
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:42,900
of a chest. The citadel.

945
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,900
Give me whatever's in here.

946
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:49,570
Okay, I

947
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:51,570
have a feeling. Yeah, right.

948
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:53,570
Say goodbye, guys. This is it.

949
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:55,570
See you later. Oh,

950
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:57,570
if I did not have the book of shadows,

951
00:49:57,570 --> 00:50:00,320
I would have been done.

952
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,320
Again, I'd like to thank the book of shadows for

953
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:05,969
making this all possible.

954
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:13,269
Geez. Again?

955
00:50:13,269 --> 00:50:16,019
Again. Again.

956
00:50:16,019 --> 00:50:18,960
Is every single room like a boss?

957
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,960
Oh, get that bomb

958
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:26,719
placement. Every single room

959
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:29,219
is a mini boss then, huh?

960
00:50:29,219 --> 00:50:38,500
Wow. Oh my god.

961
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:42,210
Hmm...

962
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:45,139
Two sloths.

963
00:50:45,139 --> 00:50:47,139
And a spirit heart. That's okay, I'll take it.

964
00:50:47,139 --> 00:50:49,829
Oh my god. I'm actually...

965
00:50:49,829 --> 00:50:51,829
I think I'm actually gonna be... I'm gonna do

966
00:50:51,829 --> 00:50:53,829
this, guys, because I have the book of shadows.

967
00:50:53,829 --> 00:50:55,829
I can... I can be incredibly

968
00:50:55,829 --> 00:50:57,829
reckless because I have the book of shadows.

969
00:50:57,829 --> 00:50:59,829
Look at how just reckless I'm being.

970
00:50:59,829 --> 00:51:03,860
Ooh.

971
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:11,409
Okay. Red patch.

972
00:51:11,409 --> 00:51:13,840
Don't remember what red patch does.

973
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,840
Stream? I need

974
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,840
your... I need your help.

975
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:24,500
I could go to the secret room.

976
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:31,599
Don't get too reckless.

977
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:33,599
That's a good... Good advice.

978
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:38,849
Red patch.

979
00:51:38,849 --> 00:51:40,849
What does it do? I don't have

980
00:51:40,849 --> 00:51:42,849
the time or the patience

981
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:46,500
to look it up.

982
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:49,960
I'll stick with it.

983
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:54,690
I'm gonna stick with it. Okay.

984
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:56,690
I gotta use this to my advantage.

985
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:59,059
Use the guard

986
00:51:59,059 --> 00:52:02,320
to my advantage. It's just like shoot

987
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,320
mania. No, it's gone.

988
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,320
Oh my god.

989
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:10,280
Gotta get rid of one of them.

990
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,280
Go away! Get away!

991
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:15,670
How much life does this

992
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:17,670
one... Oh my god.

993
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:23,239
Really now?

994
00:52:23,239 --> 00:52:25,239
It increases your attack when you get hit?

995
00:52:25,239 --> 00:52:27,239
Okay, I don't want that because I have max damage

996
00:52:27,239 --> 00:52:33,760
right now. I'm gonna take the

997
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:38,559
mushroom still. Let's go.

998
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:40,559
Hmm. Yeah.

999
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,559
Forget it. I'm going this way.

1000
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:47,750
Give me that heart.

1001
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:49,750
Secret room already was there.

1002
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,750
I'm gonna go up and then down.

1003
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:55,079
Oh, why did I waste that? I didn't

1004
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:57,079
even need it. They just scared me.

1005
00:52:57,079 --> 00:53:00,530
Oh, Monstro, you ain't got nothing.

1006
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:02,530
You ain't got nothing, Burger Boy Mastro.

1007
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:08,420
Oh, get hit

1008
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:11,619
with a tooth. Get hit with a tooth.

1009
00:53:11,619 --> 00:53:20,760
That was lucky.

1010
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,829
Alright. Is there more than one

1011
00:53:23,829 --> 00:53:25,829
secret room? There could be one right over here.

1012
00:53:25,829 --> 00:53:30,929
Maybe? No.

1013
00:53:30,929 --> 00:53:33,239
You know what? I am not messing around

1014
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:35,239
anymore. I'm going right. I'm going there.

1015
00:53:35,239 --> 00:53:37,239
I'm not gonna do any more bowl

1016
00:53:37,239 --> 00:53:39,920
snip. Going to fight

1017
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,920
whoever's in this room down here. Oh

1018
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:46,469
my god. Book of Shadows.

1019
00:53:46,469 --> 00:53:48,710
Can say it a million times.

1020
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:54,960
Well, I just...

1021
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,960
Might as well go in here. I opened the damn door.

1022
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:01,619
I'm gonna use it. And...

1023
00:54:01,619 --> 00:54:03,619
Doesn't this do something though? That's the book of Balaam.

1024
00:54:03,619 --> 00:54:08,420
There is no max damage in this

1025
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:10,420
game? Well, isn't

1026
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:12,420
that an indication of how much damage you do?

1027
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:15,429
I thought that's what it was.

1028
00:54:15,429 --> 00:54:20,920
And... Two Greeds.

1029
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:24,119
It's gotta be

1030
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:26,119
two. They gotta have two of everything, huh?

1031
00:54:26,119 --> 00:54:28,119
It's like double mint gum.

1032
00:54:28,119 --> 00:54:30,119
Double... I don't even... Money doesn't

1033
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:32,119
matter. That doesn't matter.

1034
00:54:32,119 --> 00:54:39,030
Double your pleasure. Double

1035
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:41,030
your fun. That's a statement of a

1036
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:43,030
great mint. Double mint gum.

1037
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:46,039
I'm doing it. Here we

1038
00:54:46,039 --> 00:54:48,920
go. Kain versus

1039
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:52,760
Isaac?

1040
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,510
Ah! Ah! He's...

1041
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:58,949
God.

1042
00:54:58,949 --> 00:55:00,949
I gotta utilize this as best I can.

1043
00:55:00,949 --> 00:55:02,949
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1044
00:55:02,949 --> 00:55:04,949
Come on. I gotta use this as best I can.

1045
00:55:04,949 --> 00:55:08,530
Come on! Okay.

1046
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:11,159
Book of Shadows. Come on.

1047
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:13,159
I got the power. I gotta be quiet now.

1048
00:55:13,159 --> 00:55:23,079
Or else I'm really not gonna do this.

1049
00:55:23,079 --> 00:55:25,079
Damn! God!

1050
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:39,349
God! No!

1051
00:55:39,349 --> 00:55:41,349
God damn it!

1052
00:55:41,349 --> 00:55:44,869
Oh!

1053
00:55:44,869 --> 00:55:48,519
Oh!

1054
00:55:48,519 --> 00:55:53,170
Oh!

1055
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:55,409
Oh!

1056
00:55:55,409 --> 00:55:58,869
Oh!

1057
00:55:58,869 --> 00:56:03,219
Oh!

1058
00:56:03,219 --> 00:56:05,780
Oh!

1059
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:08,719
Oh!

1060
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:10,719
And I gotta text.

1061
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:14,179
Oh!

1062
00:56:14,179 --> 00:56:17,699
I can't believe that.

1063
00:56:17,699 --> 00:56:19,699
He had

1064
00:56:19,699 --> 00:56:22,960
no health.

1065
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,269
He had zero

1066
00:56:25,269 --> 00:56:28,400
health.

1067
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,400
I should have placed bombs.

1068
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,219
I know. I just...

1069
00:56:33,219 --> 00:56:36,610
Oh!

1070
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:38,789
Oh! I

1071
00:56:38,789 --> 00:56:41,280
was so close!

1072
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,280
I was so close

1073
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,280
to beating this... the entire

1074
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,280
game. Like, that's the end of the entire

1075
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,280
game of Wrath of the Lam.

1076
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,280
And I didn't do it.

1077
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,909
Well, at least I tried.

1078
00:56:53,909 --> 00:56:57,360
Yeah, if I got

1079
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:59,360
the 20-20 hindsight,

1080
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,360
if I had done what I should have done,

1081
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,360
I didn't know it was gonna

1082
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:06,760
be like that, though. Oh, well.

1083
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,059
That's gonna be pretty funny

1084
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:11,059
video.

1085
00:57:11,059 --> 00:57:13,059
Hey, here's a full playthrough of Binding of Isaac,

1086
00:57:13,059 --> 00:57:15,059
except for the very end when

1087
00:57:15,059 --> 00:57:17,059
I die when the boss has one health.

1088
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:21,860
Oh, man.

1089
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:27,619
The death animation started.

1090
00:57:27,619 --> 00:57:30,630
Oh. Well,

1091
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:32,630
at least I tried.
