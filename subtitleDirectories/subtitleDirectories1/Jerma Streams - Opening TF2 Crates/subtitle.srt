1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:18,359
I am back. So we got, I don't know, yeah, which, maybe you guys can help me and go over which

2
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:28,230
one of these are any good. Because I really, I have no idea. I just got keys for random cases

3
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:34,490
that I still had in my inventory and I, you might look at this and go, holy shit, this guy's stupid.

4
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:43,109
He got keys for the winter 2018 case. I just, I don't know, I didn't want to give, I wanted

5
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:48,619
just to open them. That's the good one. No, that's the good one. That's the good one. Well, we'll

6
00:00:48,619 --> 00:01:07,019
find out. Okay, you should be able to see it very shortly. Okay, here we go. You ready? So what,

7
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:15,049
what's, what do you think? What do you think? I got 25 cases to open. How are these? Are these

8
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:31,340
all right? This is Blue Moon, Tough Break, Rainy Day, Abominable, Scream Fortress. Is that 12?

9
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:41,750
Winter 2018, Winter 2020, Summer 2023, obviously. That's the, these are the new ones right here.

10
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:51,189
These four are for this update. Winter 2020. That's a lot of winter and a lot of Scream Fortress,

11
00:01:51,189 --> 00:02:00,090
Jungle Jackpot, Eternal Reward. All right, we just, we're just gonna go? Facecam? No, no, no,

12
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:08,310
no facecam. Just imagine what I look like right now. You get scammed, scammed. Will he unbox at

13
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:21,379
least one strange item? I kind of feel like that's gonna happen. Okay, you ready? Let's just start at

14
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:26,810
the top. I made it nice and clear. By the way, this is what I was talking about. This is just

15
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,969
all the Scout primaries, all the Scout secondaries, all the Scout melees.

16
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:42,199
I like them to be some separation here. By quality. Notice how this is by quality.

17
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:53,080
Soldier, right? That's a Minimal Wear. What are my best items? Let me see. It's Factory New.

18
00:02:54,599 --> 00:03:00,900
I have, yeah, okay. I've got, this is a Factory New Warhawk Flamethrower. This thing is pretty

19
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:10,780
sick. Nice organization. Yeah, oh yeah. I have a really good sniper rifle too, or is it? Yeah,

20
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:17,050
I got a Purple Range Factory New. Cool. I also have a field-tested one. Why do I still have this?

21
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:22,360
I don't know. Where's the skip button to the unboxing? Okay, all right, all right, all right.

22
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:32,539
All right, Blue Moon. Let's see. Are we ready? Here we go. I could get any of these. We're looking

23
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:46,819
for the Robin Walkers. Why are people omega-lulling? Is this a bad one? Let's go. Oh, I got an Assassin's

24
00:03:46,819 --> 00:04:01,689
attire. Nothing else. Oh, a free ticket! I don't want to do this anymore. I think I'm done. That

25
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:13,590
was all right. Cool. Wait, let's look at it. Okay, I put the gibbous on because I didn't want people

26
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:20,709
to be mad that I was a bad spy player. I forgot. All right, I put this on to like hide because I

27
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:24,310
didn't want people to, because if you're in like full cosmetics, if you're like decked out a bunch

28
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:30,180
of crazy shit, people are like, oh, that's, look at all this cool stuff the spy has. I put the gibbous

29
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,819
on because I want people to go like, oh, that's like, I don't know, that he might have been playing

30
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:52,649
for very long. All right, let's put it on. Ooh, I like it. Cool. Okay, cool. Let's do it again.

31
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:08,490
I got two items again. What is it? Sky high fly guy and a backpack expander. That's cool. Those

32
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:14,870
are like worth, aren't these like five bucks? These things are like five or six bucks, aren't they?

33
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:27,449
LOL, no. No, no, no. They're a dollar. They're like five cents. Oh, okay. Well, that's cool.

34
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:45,449
Yeah, I already have. I don't really need to use this. Who's this for? Soldier. I like it. Cool.

35
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:58,089
I'm gonna keep it on. We're gonna be here all day? No, we're not. Let's do it again.

36
00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:06,439
What's the good thing from this? This is the last chance. Oh, it's another blue. I freaking

37
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:13,379
love gambling. I kind of just want the cosmetics, if I'm honest, because I've given my backpack away

38
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:19,000
like three times over the last 10 years, so I don't really have very many like cosmetic items.

39
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:27,579
I kind of want to like just get some more. This is heavy, obviously, right? I mean, I don't think I

40
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:36,949
can take off the parted wig. That's just not going to happen. I got a genuine pounding father, by the

41
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:56,019
way. Jealous. I like it. It's two jackets. One of them is just ripping through the other one. I like

42
00:06:56,019 --> 00:07:02,860
it. It looks like I don't know what I'm doing. That's perfect. Two jacket Andy. Yeah, I'm keeping

43
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:11,779
it. All right, now that's all those. So those are gone. Tough break. We're looking for a well-wrapped

44
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:28,600
hat. Okay, let's go. What's that? Ooh, what's that? Is that good? Should I even care? Winter backup?

45
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:41,819
What was that? Was it good? It's an engineer item. I love the engineer stuff.

46
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:52,860
Uh, where is it? That's kind of a rare one. I like it, but I wish I want the hair still. That's not

47
00:07:52,860 --> 00:08:04,089
the worst thing you get. Yeah, it's pretty neat. I like it. I'm not taking the level three chin off,

48
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:13,800
though. Or the stomach. It's important. Good. This is exactly what I wanted. I wanted just to get

49
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,810
items to put on to wear because I want to be able to have different outfits. All right, so what

50
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:25,670
about? Let me see. What else is in here? So that was a good one. That was winter backup. I could

51
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:42,200
inspect them, but I don't want to. I like to be surprised. Another backpack expander. Okay. But

52
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:48,950
what's the real item? Uh, ooh, this is another one. A bonk, batters, bat. So this is a backpack.

53
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:57,100
This is another kind of kind of rare one. That's cool. Let me see it. Oh shit, that's like one of

54
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:16,809
the better ones. Cool. This is not a bad drip for the scout. This kind of like hooded sweatshirt with

55
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:31,000
the bonk on the back and the sneakers. This is a pretty good outfit. I like this. I'm into it. Nice.

56
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,450
All right, one more of these. Also, I'm not, I'm probably not going to do this again. This is kind

57
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:42,009
of just like a one and done kind of deal. I just want to get some more cosmetics. So don't expect

58
00:09:42,009 --> 00:09:49,240
like, oh yeah, I'm going to open like 50 cases every week. That's no, I just had a bunch of

59
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,679
inventory and I'm just kind of clearing it out and I was going to do it off stream, but it's like,

60
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:57,269
you know what? Why don't we just, why don't I just do it here? So this is probably not happening

61
00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:06,039
again. Kappa, Kappa, Kappa. Well, it might happen at, so I don't know, but it's not like I'm not

62
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:19,289
just going to open cases. It's not a regular thing. It's a demo. Medic. I like the chef hat.

63
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:33,350
Oh, it's a, that's cool. Okay. I'll keep it. All right. I only have one of these. I have one rainy

64
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:45,500
day. So it better be good. You do not think that's cool. This is the best one. Rainy day is,

65
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:49,820
rainy day is best one. Actually, unironically, for real, people are saying this is like the

66
00:10:49,820 --> 00:11:09,029
best one that I have. All right, here we go. What is that? That's cool. I like this one a lot. I'm

67
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:19,769
going to, I'm going to wear this right now. It's going to replace the gibbous. Oh, this, I can't

68
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:27,620
have the sunglasses on. It's perfect. All right. What else? Do I have anything else?

69
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:47,980
I don't know. That's not bad. Do it with the gibbous? No, I'm not putting the gibbous on with

70
00:11:47,980 --> 00:12:03,750
this. I like this because it's got the microphone. All right. I'm keeping it. Okay. So I also have

71
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:14,889
one of these. Abominable cosmetic case. Drip or drop? I don't know. Explain the stream title.

72
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:19,210
A mod did it. I don't know. I cannot condone anything that the mods are doing right now. I have no

73
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:24,679
idea what it says. I can't even look over there because it's tabbed out. All right. What's in this

74
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:45,210
one? Let's get a red. Can you guys even hear it being opened? I'll take a Manco ticket. Why not?

75
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:56,870
Sniper? Barely. Eh, it's all right. That looks like a cool sniper hat. Kind of low on the tier

76
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:07,779
list, but see, I got a red already. The sniper outfit, I don't think can change. It's too good.

77
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:25,240
You know what I mean? I'm not sure I can take that off. It's too good. Skibbidi toilet looking

78
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:39,860
motherfucker. It works. I could put it on a different loadout. Yeah, look at this one. Skibbidi

79
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:50,070
toilet. Oh, come on. All right. This, we'll do the war paint after. I feel like that's, we do that

80
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:56,149
as a follow-up. We'll do the cosmetics first. All right. This is winter 2018. I was told that

81
00:13:56,149 --> 00:14:01,860
don't do these because they're terrible. Well, it's too late. I already have four keys for it.

82
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:14,549
So we're just gonna, we'll get through it. This is winter 2018. I only have two of these. How is

83
00:14:14,549 --> 00:14:24,789
that terrible? That's awesome. I have a little like engineer thing now. Are you serious? It's

84
00:14:24,789 --> 00:14:35,750
for the pyro? By the way, imagine this motherfucker sitting in spawn AFK. This is the actual loadout

85
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:47,379
caught red handed. This is the loadout. This is it right here. This is my loadout caught red handed.

86
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:58,519
I love my pyro loadout. I think it looks great. I love the glasses, but that's cool too. Mosquito

87
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:11,980
face. Yeah. I painted it white. Yeah. That's funny. I'll keep it. Got one more of those. So

88
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:34,340
what's the good stuff? Dumbbell, millennial mercenary. I'm very curious about that. Breadheads. Oh wow.

89
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:44,379
And I got a festivizer. Uh, engineer's my favorite class too. So this is great. I'm glad to get this.

90
00:15:44,379 --> 00:16:24,840
Well, I can't replace anything. Shit. It works. Cool. All right. I'm liking the NG stuff. All

91
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:30,970
right. Now we're going to teleport two years. This is winter 2020. I've never opened one of these.

92
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:43,539
I don't have anything. Are you using the pompson? Cause a lot of items got changed and I was just

93
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:51,700
curious as to how much. All right. 2020. Give us something good. That's, that's pretty great.

94
00:16:52,820 --> 00:17:02,169
I can wear those right now, right? Can I wear these right now? Who can wear these?

95
00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:14,390
It's an all class. Oh God damn it. Oh damn it. Oh damn it. Okay. That's exactly what's going on.

96
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:33,319
I think this is a perfect loadout now. Put it on every class. Put it on the fat guy NG. Oh,

97
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:58,839
that's a good idea. Hold on. I need, I need to get rid of the helmet though. That's going to be so

98
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:04,980
annoying to every single person that plays the game with me. It looks awful. I think it looks

99
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:28,410
great. What about a blue, right? Ooh, cool. Yeah. I love it. Remove the tracker. Uh, I like it. Those

100
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:39,930
are all the way down. I would put those up at pink. Those are, that's a pink item. That's not a blue.

101
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:54,730
Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. It's perfect. And I can wear this all year. It's all class.

102
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:22,440
Am I going to really just be like the Christmas dickhead? I guess so.

103
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:43,900
Hey, Merry Christmas all year. Put it on the soldier. Yep. It works. It works pretty well,

104
00:19:43,900 --> 00:20:22,900
especially because the Santa, um, the heavy would be great. Okay. Not bad. That's phenomenal. Just

105
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:28,980
put it on every single character and just be Christmas on every single character. All right.

106
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:37,059
Let's keep going. Uh, I'll do these last because these are, who cares? Should I just do them now?

107
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:46,500
This is this year. This is the cosmetics for right now. The patch. Should I just do them now? Do it

108
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:51,509
now? Do it last. All right. We'll do these both last cause this is also the Warpaint from this

109
00:20:51,509 --> 00:21:02,279
update too. All right. With that being said, this is Scream Fortress. This is Warpaint now.

110
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:08,359
So Warpaint is the factory new minimum, a minimal wearer field tested, like you probably used to

111
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:18,309
being seen. They changed how this works. I kind of understand it now, but let's find out. So I

112
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:27,019
only, I don't have very many left, so let's go. I only have one of these. Oh, this is X. Let's go.

113
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:40,150
What is it? It's, it's really scuffed. It's one of the good ones, but it is fucking destroyed.

114
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:50,380
Dammit. Is that the worst one? Is that the worst quality? Field tested. Dammit. Uh, let's put it on

115
00:21:50,380 --> 00:22:05,140
like something. So you can put this on any of these. That's really cool. And I think it randomizes.

116
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:11,539
It's a puke weapon. Yeah. What about the Ubersaw stuff looks really good on shotgun. You can't go

117
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:22,599
wrong either because so many people can use it. I mean, it is, it is a booger gun. What about the

118
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:34,019
mini gun? Mini gun always looks pretty cool. Too bad it's field tested. Field tested is the second

119
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:45,299
worst, right? Dammit. It's one of the good ones too. So it goes battle scarred field tested, um,

120
00:22:46,019 --> 00:23:01,559
well-worn, minimal wear, factory new. I think that's correct. Let's do it again. Something good,

121
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:08,490
at least something with higher quality. Oh, look at how awesome that one is too. And it looks

122
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:27,079
all fucked up. Dammit. This could have been my favorite paint. Field tested. Dammit. Although it

123
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:32,779
is a Halloween kind of weapon, the scuffed in the blood actually kind of adds to it.

124
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:43,029
Trash this? I don't think it needs to be trashed. I kind of like it on the wrench.

125
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:59,660
So correct, from my understanding, when, when this is put on, it, it gives a random pattern of this

126
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:10,569
paint. So it's kind of just showing you what's even possible, right? I'm seeing a lot of nos.

127
00:24:10,569 --> 00:24:21,109
You choose the pattern. Oh, somebody said, who cares? Yes, at the end of the day. That's right.

128
00:24:21,109 --> 00:24:28,579
All right. This is winter 2020 paint. We got to cross our fingers here for this one because

129
00:24:30,579 --> 00:24:33,539
we have the full Santa Claus outfit. And if we get like a cool,

130
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:59,940
kind of like candy cane paint. Manco ticket. Okay. That's really cool. But how cool is it?

131
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:15,460
Field tested again. Looks great, but another field tested. Gosh darn it. I would put it on a blade.

132
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:34,299
Ice blade. Not bad. It's cool. Starlight Serenity War Paint. All right. So that's the one you want.

133
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:57,539
Ooh, that looks pretty good. I don't see very much wrong with this and a strange count transfer tool.

134
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:11,609
Oh, here it is. It is factory new. All right. It's one of the lower tiers,

135
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:38,839
but that's fine. It's factory new. Holy shit. I'm going to be so annoying. That's really annoying,

136
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:47,609
but I think it kind of has to be there and put the festivizer on it. Yeah, that's funny.

137
00:26:47,609 --> 00:27:07,220
Okay. That leads to this one. This is another Scream Fortress 14. Cream corned war paint.

138
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:23,049
This is beat up a lot. That does not look good. Well worn. Yeah, it doesn't look terrible.

139
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:47,509
It could work on something. You can put it on the fish. That's funny. It looks sick.

140
00:27:47,509 --> 00:27:56,920
Yeah, no one's going to get that close to see it anyways. All right. So now we've got

141
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:06,039
down to the last little bits of war paint. This was jungle jackpot. I don't have any of these.

142
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:20,089
Give me a, give me like a factory new. Give me a fact. I only got one factory new. Shit.

143
00:28:20,089 --> 00:28:43,259
Bamboo brushed war paint. Yeah. The scarring on it looks a little weird. It's the weed one.

144
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:51,220
Yeah. This one's kind of, this one's kind of junk. Although it's really not that bad.

145
00:28:51,220 --> 00:29:00,420
It's a little junky. It's a lot junky. That's a lot junky. The scuffs messes with the pattern

146
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:06,089
because without the scuffs, it would still have this, at least this shading here.

147
00:29:06,089 --> 00:29:24,099
So it just makes it look kind of all broken, but it's art. That looks pretty good. I think

148
00:29:24,099 --> 00:29:37,029
that's a factory new and it's a leopard print. Oh, nice. Okay. What else? Another Manco ticket.

149
00:29:37,029 --> 00:29:42,980
I want to see. It is factory new. Nice. All right. What am I going to put the

150
00:29:42,980 --> 00:30:10,039
leopard print on? Damn. Wait, it can be different colors. Whoa. That's cool. That's really cool.

151
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:15,430
Everything looks so good on the mini gun. There's just so much surface area.

152
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:19,849
All right. That's, I'm going to have to, that's going to take a decision

153
00:30:19,849 --> 00:30:37,460
because it works on almost everything. That looks awesome. Cool. All right. I got a good one.

154
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:41,799
Even if it's not, it's a low rarity, but who cares? Again, I'm not looking for rare. I'm

155
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:46,119
not looking for unusuals. I'm not looking for anything like that. I'm just, I just want more

156
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:52,220
cosmetic items because I just don't have very many. All right. This is Infernal Reward.

157
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:58,490
I don't know what this is or what year this is, but this is, we got two more of these.

158
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:07,579
Yeah. I don't even care if it's like field tested as long as it looks kind of cool.

159
00:31:07,579 --> 00:31:21,990
Okay. Strange part. Tanks destroyed and merc stained war paint. Tanks destroyed.

160
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:32,200
Man vs. Machine. It's going to be field tested. No, that's, that's fine. That doesn't look like

161
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:39,259
minimal wear. That looks kind of beat up. It looks pretty beat up. This looks beat up.

162
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:52,660
I'm surprised that's minimal wear. What do the other ones look like if that's what it looks like

163
00:31:52,660 --> 00:32:15,529
for, I like that. Cool. It's too bright. I think it looks all right. All right. This is the last

164
00:32:15,529 --> 00:32:28,140
one of these. And then we only have the cases that are this current event. Cardboard box,

165
00:32:33,480 --> 00:33:00,490
minimal wear. So this is just a cardboard item. Put it on the black box. That's a great place to

166
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:21,109
put it. Cardboard rocket launcher. It's the Labo. It does look like the Labo. Cool. All right. So now

167
00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:31,049
we just got these four left and it's the summer 2023 stuff. So what do I want from here? Put that

168
00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:47,779
on the wrap assassin because it's not always the red rare items that people want. Do the war paint

169
00:33:47,779 --> 00:33:54,539
first because that's less exciting. Okay. Let's go. All right. This is it. This is this update.

170
00:33:54,539 --> 00:34:12,920
Let's see what happens. That looks pretty new. That looks pretty new. What? I didn't see. What

171
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:34,860
was it? It is factory new. Nice. Inspect the cases to see the options. I like to be surprised

172
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,820
because I don't, I don't want to see what I can get because then I'll go, I don't want that. I

173
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:41,639
don't want that. I don't want that. I don't want that. I want that. And then my brain is like,

174
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:51,579
you're opening this case to get that item, which is not going to happen. Right? It looks great on

175
00:34:51,579 --> 00:35:08,869
the degreaser. That's a smart gambler. I don't know if that, that's not, that statement doesn't

176
00:35:08,869 --> 00:35:25,559
hold on. Okay. Smart gambler. Oh, oh, it's a good one, but it's all fucked up. Where is it? No,

177
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:40,730
that's not bad. Minimal wear. It's kind of just like steel. Yeah. Just stainless steel. Scatter

178
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:57,260
gun. Put it on the fish. What about the knife? Flamethrower. I like that a lot because a

179
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:03,480
flamethrower would be kind of steel, wouldn't it? Like a propane tank. I kind of like that.

180
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:18,179
Put it on the fish. Let's see. Stainless steel fish. Yeah. That actually is really,

181
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:33,980
really cool. That's pretty cool. All right. Here we go. This is it. This is why you all

182
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:52,170
waited this long for me to do this. What's in the cosmetic case for 2023? All right. Okay. Okay.

183
00:36:52,170 --> 00:37:10,519
That's all right. It's pretty cool. I don't love it, but I don't hate it. I just wanted more

184
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:36,300
options. All right. And this is it. This is the last one. No more cases after this. Here we go.

185
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:50,260
No unusual. Oh well. It's not what I was looking for though. I got a couple more heavy jackets,

186
00:37:50,260 --> 00:38:13,110
the frayed edges. We need to make the call. Does the strange part count as a strange? Um,

187
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:22,500
I don't know. Can you open, can you unbox strange versions of items? I don't think that counts. No,

188
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:30,170
you can unbox a strange. So a strange part. I don't think it is like a strange item, right?

189
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:39,239
You can get strange war paints. Okay. Yeah. I don't think that counts. I think we were referring to

190
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:48,469
like orange letters out of the box. It's like a strange part, strange weapon not part. All right.

191
00:38:48,469 --> 00:38:58,730
Well, there we go. Cool. I got a new, I'm so glad that I got this. I only had to spend, um,

192
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:11,050
that's kind of like a lot for a pair of fucking shoes. Yeah. That's fun. You should buy 50 more.

193
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:23,460
No. If, okay, if I collect some more, I have some other cases like old crates, the old crates,

194
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:35,659
but maybe another time crack them open. Nah, maybe another time. Maybe another time. All right.

195
00:39:35,659 --> 00:39:42,579
That's going to be it. Uh, before we go, I do want to bring something up. So if you're just still

196
00:39:42,579 --> 00:39:51,739
hanging out, let me just head over here. So I want to bring this up. I want to talk about this is

197
00:39:51,739 --> 00:39:57,380
really actually very, very serious. Um, so I'm not, this is no, no joking around right now. I'm

198
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:05,500
talking to you pretty real. Uh, those of you that remember the Nevada Science Center, Science

199
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:12,699
Center Nevada, remember Science Center Josh, remember? Well, we, we got word. We heard that

200
00:40:12,699 --> 00:40:19,849
Josh was in a pretty, pretty major accident and it's very, very tragic. It's actually really,

201
00:40:19,849 --> 00:40:27,980
really sad and really awful. And they have a GoFundMe to try to help out. And those of you

202
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:34,699
that don't know who this is, if you watch the archeology stream where Grotto Beast was from,

203
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:41,320
he was on the stream. He was a big part of that. And if the, can the mods link it? Can we get it

204
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:51,929
like pinned? That's really terrible. So if you can spare anything, there's a link. It's a really,

205
00:40:51,929 --> 00:40:58,599
really sad, really tragic, but he was a great guy and it's a great family. And it's a, it's a really,

206
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:05,820
really terrible tragic thing to happen. He made that stream so much more fun. So hopefully,

207
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:16,300
you know, we can help out a little weekend. Yeah. I just wanted to kind of bring it up,

208
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:29,610
put some attention to it. Yeah. Yeah. Cause when we, when we heard about it, it was just like,

209
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:37,800
like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, that's too good of a fucking family, too good of a people.

210
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:45,239
It really, really is just so, it hurts. I didn't, I don't know them very well, but they came out and

211
00:41:45,239 --> 00:42:01,460
they really made that stream something special and it makes me feel terrible. Yeah. So if you can,

212
00:42:03,139 --> 00:42:19,670
it's there. Yeah. It's a terrible situation. Yeah. We're, we're, I'm just, when we heard about it,

213
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:23,829
I was just devastated. I said, how do you, how do you even, what do you even say when you see

214
00:42:23,829 --> 00:42:31,130
something like that and you know, it's just so, but we can help. We will. And I, I want to at least

215
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:36,760
make sure that I talked about it because I know a lot of people really found that stream to be in

216
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,679
Grotto. It's like a Grotto beast. Grotto beast has become like a really great success. Like it's been

217
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:47,210
really fun. I'm very fortunate over here to have that project be a success as much as it was.

218
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:59,610
So we're going to ping this in the discord too. We're going to do an announcement in the discord.

219
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:13,099
Yeah. And best of luck to that family recovering as best as they can. But yeah, I will see you guys

220
00:43:13,099 --> 00:43:22,170
later. I'll see you on, Ster's going to be hanging out for a little while. So probably next week,

221
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:27,139
I do have some stuff that I have to do for work that I need to make sure I take care of. So next

222
00:43:27,139 --> 00:43:37,349
week, keep an eye on the sus. Ster is going to be here. Yeah. Take care of yourselves. It's great

223
00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:43,670
to hang out. I know this was a short one, but yeah, just it's fun. It's fun just to hang out and just

224
00:43:43,750 --> 00:44:02,170
talk. Relax. Have a great week. I'll see you all very soon. Take care. Cool crates. Yeah,

225
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:16,679
that was kind of fun too. Opening crates is fun. Now I got some new outfits. Yeah. See you soon.

226
00:44:16,679 --> 00:44:25,059
Take care. See you next week. Oh, I'll, there'll be some Grotto beasts digital tabletop simulator

227
00:44:25,059 --> 00:44:32,150
news. I know people have been waiting for that. Been being developed for a long time. So it's,

228
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:37,480
we're going to have some stuff to talk about. So Grotto beast, Grotto beast is going to be

229
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:44,619
coming back in the digital space. Are you going to talk about it next stream?

230
00:44:45,989 --> 00:44:54,010
Maybe. That's very possible. Pog, I got no clue what's going on.

231
00:44:57,739 --> 00:45:06,360
Thanks for the support. Thank you. All right. I'll see you guys later. Take care.
