00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:11,320
Good afternoon. Hello. Hi. Hope everyone's having a good day. I know I saw you last night and the

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:21,239
night before, but you know, just checking in on you. Today we have a very special stream,

3
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:29,460
one of hopefully many of these. You probably saw the title change earlier, like an hour ago.

4
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:39,130
We're going to do the Community Content Night. I've been talking about these for a long time,

5
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:48,439
and the first one's going to be tonight, or today, depending on where you are. These streams

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,439
will be once every month or two. I am going to monitor because there was a lot of submissions.

7
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:01,560
So I'm going to try to monitor how long this stream was, right? And then count how many,

8
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,400
I guess I'm going to keep track of how many tabs I had and how many length of the videos and all

9
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,439
that stuff. So I have no idea. This stream might be long, it might be kind of short,

10
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:19,340
but I want this is the first one. This is an experiment. He's got a stream monitor open.

11
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:31,750
You know, when you have too many tabs, when Google Chrome no longer puts the new tabs on top of the

12
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:42,519
screen. When I was clicking new tabs, it's like a ruler. Each increment of where a centimeter

13
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:48,900
is a new tab. It's a ruler up here. A giant ruler, a yardstick with centimeters on it.

14
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:58,890
Those are hard to find. Not using Firefox. Well, I use Chrome on stream. I use Firefox

15
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:12,580
for me. That's me. Chrome? Stream. Firefox? Me. Why do I do that? Well, that's because I do all of my

16
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:20,979
things on Firefox. I do all of my banking on Firefox. I do all of my all of my passwords

17
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:27,659
going to Firefox. So Chrome is a completely separated, totally separate entity that is

18
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:46,520
only for streams. Banking. All his Reddit accounts are on Firefox. Why do you have that many stream

19
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:57,289
tabs open? What do you mean stream tabs? Not using Internet Explorer? Here's the thing about Edge.

20
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:10,310
Isn't Edge kind of good? No. I've, I've heard that it's sort of good now. No, it's not. No.

21
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:18,889
I've heard it. It's okay. They've been slowly building that browser to make it a little bit

22
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:26,889
better for everybody, I think. But I like Firefox. Chrome was all right, but I don't know. When you

23
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:32,569
do Ctrl Alt Delete when you have one browser of Chrome open. I don't know why browsers do this.

24
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:40,360
Some of them do. Why are there like 12 processes when you have a Chrome browser open? Why? What does

25
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:55,460
it do? Why can it be one? It's one per tab. That's because Chrome sucks. Each process is a tab. No.

26
00:03:56,409 --> 00:04:04,340
How my number is doing? Oh, shit. I forgot to open it. I forgot to keep it open. I turned off my

27
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:11,770
computer. I was gonna have it going for like 16 hours. Oh, well. I'm never playing it again now.

28
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:18,629
That's the nail in the coffin right there. Not playing it again. Once you make a mistake like

29
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:23,740
that, you cannot do that again. Now I have to go. What am I gonna open it again? Wow, that's too much

30
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:32,730
work. And speaking of work, I would like to change. We're gonna move on here. We're gonna start.

31
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:39,480
There are a lot of videos. There are a lot of pieces of artwork. This is Community Content

32
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:44,279
Knight number one. You were here for this one. You were here for the first one ever.

33
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:58,759
So let's start with the artwork. Here it is. This is artwork number one. Now one thing I do have to say

34
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:08,889
for the future. In the future, it's probably a good idea for you guys to watermark these with

35
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:14,600
your name because there are so many submissions that it's kind of, you know, it's hard to keep

36
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,959
track of every single person. So for the future, if you have something you want to put forward here,

37
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:28,149
throw a watermark on it if you want. If you, you know, want people to know that it was you.

38
00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:40,790
It's mine now. Now let's go. Should I do cam for this? I don't want to do cam. Should I? I'm like,

39
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:45,689
all right, I'll just be down here at the bottom. All right. So how do you, I don't use Chrome.

40
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:54,920
How do you zoom in on Chrome? Is it control and scroll? What is it? This is, I don't use

41
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:00,730
Chrome. This is my streaming computer. There we go. All right. So this looks like a rumble.

42
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:06,009
This is, isn't, this is, uh, Gloo Man, Demon Lord Zaraxos, and a bunch of other fucking crazy

43
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:12,019
characters. So we got, this isn't good. Demon Lord Zaraxos is too strong, but if I fail,

44
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:18,019
the Jerma Rumble is doomed. You think you can beat me, you Gloo Man, the original shit character?

45
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:24,379
And then a big laugh. I'm the lord of all hells. You haven't got a chance. I may be the original

46
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:31,100
shit character, but I won't give up. Not when all of my friends are counting on me. You can do it.

47
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:36,329
All the beers agree on it. Beer. I make all the rules, kid, and I rule number one is don't lose

48
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:40,470
to this asshole. Gloo Man, win this for all the shit characters. This is all, that's all I get.

49
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:48,970
This is all the shitty characters. Like, well, that's, that's not a shit character. Do the voices.

50
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:58,410
You know, I need to sip my fucking cold classic before I can do that. Read, I'm reading them.

51
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:08,329
I am reading them. No, you can do it. All the beers agree on it. Beer. I make all the rules,

52
00:07:08,329 --> 00:07:14,810
kid, and number one is don't lose to this guy. That boy didn't have a voice. Gloo Man,

53
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:20,009
win this for the shit characters. We believe in you. That's not what his voice is. That's

54
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:27,100
a placeholder. It's a template. Uh, Gloo Man can beat him. I bet all of my goat eggs on it.

55
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:34,279
And you can never have too many eggs. That's true. Hey, I think you fucking jump seed my grandson.

56
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:48,230
The little shit fuckhead is late for the stream. That's the best character. It is. I'm not late.

57
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,750
It's not even two o'clock. It's not even two o'clock. What are you on about?

58
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,720
That was great. And look at how quickly we can just go like this. Here's another fair

59
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:10,199
enough for the egg. Did someone ask for an egg? Balancing eggs. Very good. I'm early. I'm not

60
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:17,430
early. I'm in the exact window. Good stuff. I did say this in the rumble video, but the egg has

61
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:23,660
only been in two videos ever. He just, he has, that's the test of time. If you don't want a

62
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:29,500
character is, is just, is a great character when they've been on camera and on screen

63
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:42,409
for a collective, maybe seven minutes in 10 years of me doing this. And this fireman,

64
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:53,850
observe this individual, this handsome fireman. That's terrifying. That's horrifying, but still

65
00:08:53,850 --> 00:09:02,679
cool at the same time. Am I going to play cube world? Are you going to play cube world?

66
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:13,639
Did I just get asked if I'm going to play cube world? No, I'm not. I'm not going to play cube

67
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:22,309
world. Uh, this is this, uh, person said that this is drawn in the, uh, style of, uh, I'm going to,

68
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:25,990
I'm going to butcher this name and it's a very popular, very, very talented artist,

69
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:37,299
Gendi Tartovsky, Gendi Tartovsky, Turovsky. What am I so phonetically spelled out for me, please.

70
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:47,529
The book is just almost flew out of my nose and we're not even five minutes into the stream.

71
00:09:48,649 --> 00:10:03,159
He practiced that line for three hours. What? Gendi? Whatever. It's, that's, that's the guy

72
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:09,740
made Samurai Jack. Very cool. I love the line work. You're going to get, uh, by the way, you're,

73
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:16,440
I don't know anything about art. Uh, like you're going to get weird, uh, positive things here. I'm

74
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,279
going to be like, Oh, I really love the, uh, I really love the, the, the color scheme. And

75
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:23,559
if you're going to be like, fuck you talking about, you don't know anything about color schemes,

76
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:26,519
idiot. And I'm going to be like, I don't know. I just like it. So I don't know anything.

77
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:41,529
This is actually my ideal outfit. If I could wear this every day, I would, like, I mean, I do

78
00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:47,240
besides, I mean, it's, it's blue, but this is, oh, I didn't show you this. This is, I, I got,

79
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,000
let me tell you something. I got a quick story for you. Take a look at this shit. I like this

80
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,840
shirt a lot and now I can never probably wear it again. Unless I get something like Oxy clean

81
00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:01,559
or something to fix it. Take a look at this shit. I have coffee all over me. Can you guys see that?

82
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:13,429
It's literally all over the whole shirt. Um, coffee shops do this thing sometimes where they

83
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:22,149
fill your coffee so high to the brim that when the lid goes on, it creates this fucking vacuum

84
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:28,009
that sucks up the coffee and pushes it out of the top. Cause there's a bunch of ice in it. And I

85
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:32,409
don't know if it's like a cooling to heat rises. I have no idea, but they make, they fill it to

86
00:11:32,409 --> 00:11:38,970
the brim so high that it's just obnoxiously high. And then they go, and when you grab it and you

87
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:43,850
go over it and you put your straw in, you get sprayed by coffee because there's pressure in

88
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:53,429
there somehow. Well, I got coffee sprayed. Like it was like, if you work at a coffee shop, you gotta

89
00:11:53,429 --> 00:12:00,629
go like three or four centimeters under the line. Come on. And I'm just sitting there going like,

90
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:08,139
now what do I do? Now what do I do? Right? It wouldn't spray all over your shirt. Well, it was

91
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:12,139
like, and I'm like, oh shit. And it started dripping down, down, drip, drip, drip, drip,

92
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:16,700
drip. And I'm like, oh, it was very, very fast. You can't react fast like that.

93
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:30,100
Sorry for giving you more coffee. I guess that's not customer error. That's called the coffee was

94
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:43,399
filled too high to the top and it sprayed me customer error. You got extra coffee. No, I got

95
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:48,840
extra ice because what they do with a lot of these coffee shops is they dump a fucking whole

96
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:54,899
cooler worth of ice in your drink. And then they pour like three shots of fucking liquid in there.

97
00:12:55,830 --> 00:13:00,870
And then over the course of a day or of a few hours or whatever, or an hour, your ice melts

98
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:05,429
and fills the rest of the drink up. It's just ice. You drink an ice. That's why you say no ice or

99
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:14,379
you say light ice, please. If you don't say light ice, you get a, you get like a tailgating party

100
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:22,330
worth the fucking ice in your drink. Light ice. Then they go, you know, normal. Anyways, that's

101
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:27,980
a great outfit. That's the outfit that I wear every day. Oh, this is during the, the, the Werma.

102
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:35,029
There we go. See, there we go. Dragon breath. There it is. Those of you that remember this stream,

103
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:47,059
this is from the dreams stream, which I took, took the defeat there that I, I couldn't really do it.

104
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:55,850
Why did you create me, Jeremy? I think this is based on the Garfield stuff, right? You know,

105
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:02,600
that's Werma. It's, it's horrifying. This is exactly what it looked like. This is not, I mean,

106
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:11,659
this is, this is an artist representation of Werma, but it's 100% accurate. And just in the

107
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:22,299
case you felt like sleeping tonight, here's the German scorpion. You can't stop me, Jeremy.

108
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:33,269
That's fucked up. Yeah, it is. Those of you that have played a certain video game, this is Ludwig.

109
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:44,600
That's what I see. It's great. That's from dragon breath. Thank you. These are great.

110
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:56,789
Very well done. This is my, they said this is my fursona. Frog. Yeah, that's right. I don't know,

111
00:14:56,789 --> 00:15:02,389
I don't know, I don't know who that is. Is that, that's supposed to be me with the star wars shirt

112
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:21,610
on. Frogs don't have fur. I don't give shit. That's my frog soda. Fireman, take a look.

113
00:15:22,549 --> 00:15:32,679
This is Clown Fireman. I mean, that's perfect. Timely, timely as well. Look at this dude.

114
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:42,279
He's so cute. I know. Fireman is, is the most adorable character, I think, that exists.

115
00:15:43,429 --> 00:15:46,629
You could make a whole franchise around Fireman. You could have like, you could have like a

116
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:55,820
children's tv show. You could have a platformer that they could teach like safety and shit.

117
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:05,379
Fireman walks into like rooms and like lights shit on fire and then tells you like, this is

118
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:19,000
what you have to do. You're monetizing memes. Look out for this dude. Sell out the character,

119
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:26,309
will till we hate it. No, why would I do that? Fire Marshall Bill. And there's another one here

120
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:46,620
too. Look at that. It's just beautiful. But why is he so sad? What happened? Why is he so, why,

121
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:58,899
what happened? Just crying because he's sad. This is a meme. Oh, because I sold him out. No,

122
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:08,099
I didn't. Now this one in particular, for one second I was like, oh shit, there's somebody

123
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:15,960
naked here, but it's all right. This was, this is a banner that was made for the whole Jerma Rumble

124
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:24,890
pretty much over the years, I guess. It's awesome. We got Batboy up here, the egg.

125
00:17:25,529 --> 00:17:29,210
Now let's see if I know, let's see if I know my own character universe.

126
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:42,730
His uh, wall dad, super green screen, Charlie uh, cheese nips, Pac-Man, 30s, Milkman, the egg, me,

127
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:55,529
Batboy, Demon Bloods, Raxos, Sonic the Pencil, uh, Captain Cheez-It, right? Oh fuck, who's that?

128
00:17:55,529 --> 00:18:04,200
Salad Fingers? No, what, did I put Salad Fingers in a rumble? Oh, Frogman from Dark Souls,

129
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:12,279
Frogman from Dark Souls, right? Frogman, this super Jax. Uh, there's the VR guy, a little bit

130
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:17,480
of background here. VR guy is my, probably like top three favorite characters I've ever made in a

131
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,490
video game. That whole thing, that the whole thing just was perfect for me. I loved every second of

132
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:30,170
it. That's VR guy. Uh, Garfield, Miserable Mikey, uh, Dr. Roker, Dr. Roker's pizza, haven't eaten one.

133
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:41,539
VR, why, why VR guy? Because he was on a wireless VR headset and just was playing a VR game and

134
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:46,250
didn't know he was in a wrestling event. That's my favorite character. Are you making fun of my

135
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:57,450
favorite character? Uh, there's grandpa, obviously, there's me again. Look at how deep, I love, I love

136
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:05,049
the, all right, here we go. I don't know shit about art, but here we go. I like the smoothness. I like

137
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:13,029
the, the almost, um, I love the smoothness of the palette. What am I trying to say? I love the,

138
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:21,190
it's like sanded almost. It's like sanded wood. I love the sanded wood look here. Take a look at

139
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:31,779
us, you know what I mean? It looks great. So we got Blue Man, uh, Mr. Sneak Man. Everybody has a man.

140
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:40,980
Everyone's man or boy. I'm coming to that realization right now. Uh, this is Bia, Bia, Bia 38,

141
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:48,359
by the way, I don't think I know my own characters. That's Bia 38. Uh, Dick Dastlely Richard.

142
00:19:48,359 --> 00:20:03,930
Oh fuck, I don't know his name. Chuck, Chuck Schnauz, right? Chuck Schnauzwell, that's the one.

143
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:07,369
And that's the bottom half of the two person horse. I got it. And we had 10 community subs

144
00:20:07,369 --> 00:20:15,720
just come in from Soft33. Thank you. Soft33, appreciate that. 10 subs. Congratulations to

145
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:21,000
those who got them. And thank you for the giant sub drop. Really. Thanks a lot. Forgot Frogman.

146
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:29,240
Well, I don't, I just, it's been a while. This is fantastic, Bill. It was awesome. And then

147
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,710
there's another one right after this one. I remember this one. I did, I've shown a couple

148
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:41,029
of these already on stream, but Jesus, some of these are so fucking good. You have to just look

149
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:53,019
at them again. You nailed it. It's a police sketch. That's the best damn police sketch

150
00:20:53,019 --> 00:21:09,980
I've ever seen in my life. Uh, no, this is great. I love the, it almost looks like it was,

151
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:15,000
you know what I'm saying? You did the whole thing and then it was like,

152
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:28,390
whatever that's called. I love the smoothness of it. It's dope. I mean, you know what I'm saying? I

153
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:36,759
love, I love the tapping of it. I love the tapped smeared tapped on the cheeks. You know what I'm

154
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:42,089
saying? Like see here, it's like a, I can, I know exactly how your hand moved when you did this,

155
00:21:42,089 --> 00:21:56,390
by the way. You went like this, like here's the paper. You went like, like, no, what are you

156
00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:07,700
talking about? This is pencil. I know. But after the pencil was done, you went there with like a,

157
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:16,180
like a cloth and you went like, it's fucking fantastic. It seriously is. Thank you for this.

158
00:22:16,819 --> 00:22:31,059
And that's me as Spider-Man. The Simpsons. What the fuck? It's like Peter Parker.

159
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:39,049
My brain is fucking fried apparently. I don't know why that was instantly, that was instantly

160
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:54,859
Peter Parker. They both start with an S. That's the problem. Spider-Man Simpsons. Peter Parker.

161
00:22:54,859 --> 00:23:05,029
Thanks for drawing me as Peter Parker. No, this is great too. I have no idea why that came out.

162
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:11,960
Seriously. By the way, this outfit, I love it. I love the gray. Gray? Here's, I'm going to give

163
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:16,519
you, look, those are guys that are like, oh, I need some fashion sense. How do I, help me.

164
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:19,799
Well, I don't care. I can't help you up here because this is obviously like a joke, right?

165
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:29,640
But for here, gray, gray, black, blue, gray, black, blue, gray top, black jeans, blue sneakers,

166
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:36,039
black top, gray jeans, blue sneakers, blue top, black jeans, gray sneakers. Boom. I just did

167
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:42,259
your entire wardrobe for the rest of your life. Gray, black, blue, different shades. You could

168
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:50,809
have like a navy blue shirt, black pants, black shirt, black pants, black shoes, navy blue shirt,

169
00:23:50,809 --> 00:24:11,769
navy blue shoes, gray pants, gray shows sweat. They all do. Okay. We're all humans. That's boring.

170
00:24:11,769 --> 00:24:24,440
No, it's stylish and it's classic. Guys, it's classic. If, if you have the timeless for a reason.

171
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:39,829
This is called, this is called when chat is bored. I think too many jupes. There it comes. Can we get

172
00:24:39,829 --> 00:24:45,619
one? I want one completed one. I want a real completed one or I'm not moving on. I will sit

173
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:49,460
here until we go. Somebody got it. They got it. Good. You got, wow. Holy shit. You guys did it

174
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:59,769
very easily. That's, I'm surprised you did it that quickly. It's too many jupes, too many jupes. That's

175
00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:10,569
what we're seeing right now in chat. Stream will be bopping. Remember that one. This is great.

176
00:25:11,289 --> 00:25:22,789
This one's really good. Yeah. They're all really good, but yeah, this is fantastic. Yeah. This is

177
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:27,660
from the game that I don't, I can't even, I can't even tell you the title. I don't know what it is.

178
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:34,380
It's something about like existence is, existence is futile or whatever. Resistance is futile.

179
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:42,220
That's the Borg from Star Trek. It's something like that. You'll find it. Type in the word like

180
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:48,630
existence into the steam bar and like it'll probably pop up. This is weed game, whatever

181
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,589
you want to call it. But this is great. This is the very beginning of the game. That's the best

182
00:25:51,589 --> 00:26:05,450
part of the whole game. What's bopping? What's bopping, gamer? Yeah, that's true. What else we

183
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:10,650
got here? But that's great. Thank you. Oh shit. We're zoomed in, but this one is, this one's got

184
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:18,220
our, one of our favorite characters. That's an iced coffee. That's fireman enjoying an iced coffee

185
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:24,980
while the rat cooks a marshmallow on his head. I mean, this is like, come on, this is genius.

186
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:35,930
And I think they're in the desert. So this is probably somewhere in Las Vegas. Hot chocolate.

187
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:44,730
Oh, it is a hot chocolate. I thought it was an iced coffee. All right. That's my head cannon.

188
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:49,130
That's an iced coffee because he's like fireman. He's got to like cool down with an iced coffee.

189
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:58,059
I thought that was ice, like ice coffee. Whatever. But this is, I love it. I love the rat. I love

190
00:26:58,059 --> 00:27:08,660
the marshmallow. He needs to heat it up. He would die if he drank this. No, he wouldn't. Why would

191
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:15,900
he die if he drank this? This is not going to kill him. Why would this kill him? Because it's cold.

192
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:31,049
It's too cold. Guys, if there's a fire blazing, like if you have a fire blazing and you pour a

193
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:35,130
water on it, you're not going to put the fire out. You're going to, it's going to be like,

194
00:27:36,009 --> 00:27:38,490
and then just come back. It's not, you're not going to put the whole thing out.

195
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:45,130
If you have a big fucking fire in front of you and you take a cup of water this big and you go like

196
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:53,049
this, it's going to go and it's not going to put it out. You need a bucket of, if this was a bucket

197
00:27:53,049 --> 00:28:05,319
of iced coffee, then maybe I would be concerned. Do it. Especially, you know, he, he might be made

198
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:12,740
out of grease. So that would just make it worse. If this was a cup of like powder, how do you get

199
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:19,220
rid of a grease fire? It's powder, right? Yeah. This was a cup of like talcum powder. Get it away

200
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:31,130
from him. Sand. Yeah. Yep. Cover it. Don't go near him. Don't cover him with anything.

201
00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:43,930
You use milk. Now this is great though. Thank you. This also is a strangely, strangely in like the

202
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:50,250
same spot somehow. This says, it's so the curio had cheated death in the cemetery outside Good

203
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:58,460
Springs, cheated death once again. And the Mojave wasteland was forever changed. That was odd.

204
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:12,299
Michael's trip to Vegas. This is pretty good. Is this a spoiler? Spoiler for what? Wait, is this

205
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:27,349
not, is it, is this the end of the, of the game? This is the, this is the game's intro. No, it's

206
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:36,619
not. Is this the outro? Is this the game's outro? Uh oh. The game's been up for 15 years. If you

207
00:29:36,619 --> 00:29:41,059
didn't play it yet, you're not going to play it. And by the way, why have you, why have you not

208
00:29:41,059 --> 00:29:49,029
played it? It's the best one. It's the first portion of the outro. Let's skip that one then.

209
00:29:52,279 --> 00:30:00,009
This is a odd, we'll stay on the odd. Odd Michael theme. You know what I really like on this one?

210
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:12,059
I like the pixelated graphics. Each beard is a pixel line. I like it. It's, you got the edges

211
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:20,970
here. Very pixelated. Nice teeth. I like the beard. It's the, the beard really draws you in.

212
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:25,779
When you look at this, what's the first thing you look at? You look bang right at that beard.

213
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:39,259
This right here. I haven't shaved, so this still works. Looking good. Thank you for the, uh,

214
00:30:39,259 --> 00:30:45,099
and we've got the pretzel here too. That's what I like the most. Same artist, I believe, but this

215
00:30:45,099 --> 00:30:55,819
is Jex. I don't have that much hair though. No, I did. I did have this much hair. I forgot. Do you

216
00:30:55,819 --> 00:31:00,940
guys remember like two or three years ago how fucking long this was? It came down, it came down

217
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:10,599
to like here. It was crazy, but it wasn't nice long. It was just gross long. It was ugly. It was

218
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:18,019
just long and to here. I didn't have it layered, so it was just weird looking. Now my hair is a

219
00:31:18,019 --> 00:31:25,799
mustache. That's fine. I'd probably rather have mustache hair, but this is great. It's got the

220
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:33,829
glasses too. What the heck are you talking about? Old man, even bald for 30 years. I hadn't even

221
00:31:33,829 --> 00:31:48,569
been alive for 30 years, but that's Jex and this was Odd Michael. Good shit. This is me. I did,

222
00:31:48,569 --> 00:31:58,950
I did this one. Oh, right. This is, this is a part, okay, this is a part two. I have no idea

223
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:05,000
what I was doing here. I can't, I don't know. This was supposed to be what? This was Twitch,

224
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:14,819
right? And then this is a streamer. Oh, right. This is from, from a couple weeks ago. So I,

225
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:24,539
this is me drawing a streamer. This is, Jeremy is my favorite finger YouTuber. What do you do?

226
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:31,000
Just go like this. Hey, what's going on guys? Welcome back. Uh, welcome back to, uh, hands

227
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:46,950
episode of 415. Yep. That's the one. I'm going to go like this today. Okay. What would that even

228
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:53,079
mean? Hand, just, uh, this time a finger. I'm a YouTuber that just finger hand YouTuber.

229
00:32:55,049 --> 00:32:59,930
He's still got it. He's still got it. Yeah, guys, I don't know. I'm really like trying to think

230
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:05,529
about a change here. I've been a, I've been a finger YouTuber for like the last six years

231
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:10,650
and I kind of want to move on. I want to move forward. I want to keep the content going.

232
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:15,369
So I'm thinking of transitioning into elbow, you know, I know, I know I'm looking at the

233
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:19,769
comments right now. No, it used to be so much fucking cooler when you were a hand YouTuber,

234
00:33:19,769 --> 00:33:23,450
but no, I don't want to elbow is different. I don't know. I don't want that guy. I'm just

235
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:30,230
trying to do something different now. You know what I mean? You got, you like, you guys cool.

236
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:36,059
I know people can take a while. Maybe just give it like 10 or 12 episodes. Look, I'll do here.

237
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:42,380
How about this? Once a week, I'll do a hand and a finger YouTube video, but like I'm going to,

238
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:55,880
I'm really into this right now. Uh, anyways, the next image is a continuation of this. I believe

239
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:15,699
they drew this. They like interpreted that. Oh, is this supposed to be me? No. Why am, why am I

240
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:31,480
being like obeyed? It's me watching your stream vessel. Right. Right. Right. Right. Let's take a

241
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:43,500
look. See how accurate it is. Pretty, pretty accurate. This is the fucking thing you hang up

242
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:53,960
on the fridge that your three-year-old drew. This is not streamer. This is how is your first day

243
00:34:53,960 --> 00:35:01,429
of the first grade? Well, this, this, this Mr. Stevenson is really nice and we got to go to

244
00:35:01,429 --> 00:35:11,289
computers and he turned on all the computers for us. And then I prayed. I played Minecraft.

245
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:16,329
Oh, wow. Wait, wait, your T your teachers letting you play video games in school.

246
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:23,530
Yeah. I played Minecraft for 10, 20 minutes. I'm going to be writing a letter to that

247
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:32,679
fucking superintendent, but I was just great. Thank you. Pull them out of that school.

248
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:44,409
Now they, they, they should, they should be teaching children about what should they be teaching kids

249
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:49,030
now? What do they teach? What are the, what's in school now? I haven't been in school in a long

250
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:52,389
time. What's the, what's like the, what's the first class you take in like middle school?

251
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:05,260
Stocks. No, they don't. There's no, I would have signed up for that class in like high school.

252
00:36:06,699 --> 00:36:14,179
Science taxes. They don't teach you how to do taxes. You want to talk about how fucking

253
00:36:14,179 --> 00:36:20,980
strange the American educational system is. We have this thing that everybody has to fucking do

254
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:30,619
when they get older. When you get to be 15, 14, 15, 16, 17 years old, why are they not teaching

255
00:36:30,619 --> 00:36:37,190
us how the tax system works? Because you just get a job afterwards and then you just are supposed

256
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:47,289
to know who fucking supposed to tell you these things. It would have been really nice to know

257
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:59,590
how the credit system worked. But Christopher Columbus drove his boat and found this.

258
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:11,860
Okay. How do, what does credit mean? And please help me. I didn't know what credit fucking was

259
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:20,550
until I was like, I didn't understand how the system worked until I was like 26. And I would

260
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:31,000
imagine that a lot of you guys still don't fucking know. Exactly. That's what I'm saying.

261
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,960
Why is this not like a subject to teach us skills? Give us like skills that we need. Give us life

262
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:45,320
skills. Roll the TV in and show the Christopher Columbus shit on the TV. We'll be way more

263
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:57,110
involved in that one. There's got to be like a, an old like magic school bus episode about

264
00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:02,309
Christopher Columbus. That's 22 minutes long. That's not like eight days worth of reading

265
00:38:02,389 --> 00:38:19,579
textbooks. Teach me how to do my taxes. Teach me how to live. Does a magic school bus have like a

266
00:38:19,579 --> 00:38:32,119
taxes episode? That'd be pretty fucking funny if they did. Anyways, sorry. I mean, I just,

267
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:37,269
I just want our education. I want, I want people to be, I want our education system to be working.

268
00:38:41,670 --> 00:39:01,349
German 95 in Cox Cowboy, the slowest upload in the West. What is this? What is that? Is that a brum?

269
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:08,539
Am I holding like a brim up? Okay. At Hot Topic, they sell those lamps that are like that, right?

270
00:39:08,539 --> 00:39:26,739
Is that a lamp? It's a horse. Where's, where's the horse? And who like shaved it? Because there's a

271
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:45,820
large chunk missing here. Is this the tail? Is this the horse's tail? And like the horse is like out

272
00:39:45,820 --> 00:40:04,500
here. This is the horse's mane. Well, what, what is this? Is this like the, that's it looks like a bar.

273
00:40:05,219 --> 00:40:38,980
Sometimes it's too easy. This is great. This is Glooman. Got you. Please stop. People are

274
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:54,179
going to actually think that you're dumb. This is why if only they fucking taught us in school

275
00:40:56,219 --> 00:41:00,250
zoology, I would have been able to know immediately what the fuck that was.

276
00:41:05,269 --> 00:41:17,429
Don't blame me. Blame the educational system that I was taught, which was algebra two part two.

277
00:41:17,429 --> 00:41:22,869
I don't remember a goddamn thing from algebra two part two. Not a thing. I don't even know. I,

278
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:26,630
I'm going to close my eyes. I'm going to try to think of one word that came out in that class.

279
00:41:27,579 --> 00:41:44,780
I can't. Imaginary numbers. And I don't look, math is important, right? But I don't buy

280
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:51,019
the whole thing that they used to sell us in those classes. You don't think you're going to use it,

281
00:41:51,019 --> 00:42:00,650
but you will event. You're going to use it. You don't know you will, but you will. Yeah. When?

282
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:07,530
When have I ever done like X parentheses, two plus three brackets? No, we have Excel for that.

283
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:25,349
Mrs. Stevenson. This is great. Glooman, by the way, like this is, this is perfect.

284
00:42:25,909 --> 00:42:31,210
I don't know why I thought that said style Seinfeld. It's like, wow, he fucking nailed it.

285
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:37,719
I didn't, there's a Seinfeld style in, uh, uh, soul caliber. That's pretty cool. What does it do?

286
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:48,420
And I mean, like this could be like a Seinfeld thing. That's like a Kramer move or something.

287
00:42:48,420 --> 00:43:08,280
I don't know. Oh, here we go. We've seen these before. I just, uh, that was like, so that was

288
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:15,530
such a stretch. Oh yeah, Kramer, when he walked in and he goes like, he does that though. That's,

289
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:21,130
okay, that's not a stretch. That's not a stretch. He does that shit. He like opened the doors and

290
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:30,789
he like, he would like fucking move his hands around and be like, oh, Jerry. But this is from

291
00:43:30,789 --> 00:43:38,699
Yan Wen. This is, uh, some great stuff from Yan Wen. Look at me, Jerry, look at me. This, I think

292
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:49,130
this is the first one that, uh, Yan Wen ever, uh, thank you, at least on stream. So I can't even,

293
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:55,210
man. Uh, but yes, it's fucking fantastic. Yan Wen is incredibly talented as you'll see here.

294
00:43:55,210 --> 00:44:08,260
This is one of my favorites. This is the, uh, Seagull one. It's so good. It's so detailed.

295
00:44:09,059 --> 00:44:17,769
It looks first. It looks nice. It's so, yeah, I'll tell you up here. See up here, the effect

296
00:44:17,769 --> 00:44:25,530
that the wings are flapping is done. It's achieved by like, you take your, you take the palette and

297
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:33,940
you take a little bit of a cloth and you like dip it in some water and you go to blur it out. The

298
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:39,989
blurred image is representing movement because if you take a photo, if you would take a picture of

299
00:44:39,989 --> 00:44:47,050
this happening, the frame rate would not be fast enough. Your ISO would need to be, um, closed

300
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:51,909
or opened, you know, depending on your, your shutter speed has to, it has to do with it too.

301
00:44:51,909 --> 00:45:02,630
So if you, you see, this is like a great family photo. Of course stocks are crashing. Like,

302
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:17,940
wait, like in real, like in real life. All right. Let's imagine like the Dow drops like 10,000

303
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:32,869
points. Someone just comes into Twitch chat and just goes, all right, what happened? Oh, well,

304
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:48,659
time to buy gold. This is also from Yan Wen. This is, uh, before the carnival happened. Get

305
00:45:48,659 --> 00:46:00,940
yourself, get, hey, unfortunately, I was not the clown in that string. That's no, it's, that is,

306
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:14,900
that is not a penis. That's a dog or it's a cat. That's, I, that's, I don't know how to make a dog.

307
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:20,940
So that's pretty accurate. This is me trying to make a dog. Look at that intense face though.

308
00:46:21,739 --> 00:46:32,329
I could paint it on eyebrows. I should ask Polly polite, see if she can help me here.

309
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:38,780
But they're all, I picked out a few of my favorites there. So they're all, ah,

310
00:46:39,659 --> 00:46:43,420
damn it. You ever, that ever happened? You ever get like stuck and you have to like,

311
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:50,619
that's been happening a lot lately. What's wrong with me? It's me with the rats.

312
00:46:51,260 --> 00:47:01,320
It happens. Sometimes you just get like a little kink. Uh, it's just me hanging out with my rat

313
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:13,340
friends. Go see a chiropractor. I've actually been told that before, but chiropractors are weird

314
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:21,909
because 50% of all people say chiropractors are horse shit and they're fake and it's like going

315
00:47:21,909 --> 00:47:28,150
and getting a psychic reading. And then 50% of people will tell you, I went to a chiropractor

316
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:47,880
and it changed my life. So who, what the, who do I fucking believe? I guess if you go to like,

317
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,920
some people can go to like a psychic reading and that can change your life too. Cause they're like,

318
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:54,360
oh, you have money coming in the future and you're like, holy shit, that was awesome.

319
00:47:55,079 --> 00:48:04,619
I guess that could, that makes sense. I don't know. It scares the shit out of me too. I don't

320
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:09,019
know. I feel like, okay, like lie down here and just put your back that way. Okay. Now I'm going

321
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:14,619
to turn your body like this and I'm going to put my knee into your back and pull as hard as I can

322
00:48:14,619 --> 00:48:22,889
this way and snap the other way with my knee and like break your back. Right. And then they like,

323
00:48:22,889 --> 00:48:28,250
I've seen like, I've seen videos of people that they put them like in this like device,

324
00:48:28,969 --> 00:48:33,530
they like lock their head like this. And then the guy takes like a thing and like puts it around

325
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:42,340
their head and like pulls it up. Like, and every time I see one of those videos, I just go, I don't

326
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:50,679
want to fucking do that. But then somebody will tell me, man, you got to go. You got to go. I'm

327
00:48:50,679 --> 00:48:56,630
telling you, like, I feel like my, my spine's got like fluid in it now. I'm not going to go.

328
00:48:57,190 --> 00:49:02,730
I don't want to have like that thing put around my head. It's going to be like medieval torture

329
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:13,980
device, but this is great. Me and the rat friends. That's a fireman. He's got underwear on. Relax.

330
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:27,739
This is a super fireman, as you can see, powered up in or in mid powering, possibly. Good Lord.

331
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:34,219
Yeah. I wonder how many ice coffees it would take to put this one out.

332
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:51,900
Right guys. God. And then from the same artist, this is Dick Dastley Richard. I like this a lot.

333
00:49:51,900 --> 00:50:00,329
I like the, the bag. I like the, the eye slots. It looks, it makes it look more like a mask.

334
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:13,050
It's a hand tuber. Yep. Contemplating getting into the hand tuber scene. Did you, did you paint,

335
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:19,909
did you do that? That looks, this is really cool. Did you take the media from the game

336
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:30,170
and just kind of layer it on here and then go over like around it? That's pretty cool.

337
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:38,260
Cause this is, this looks like the game media. That's exactly what I did. Nice. That's awesome.

338
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:42,500
And if not, then you came really, really, really almost scarily close to what it actually looks

339
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:57,099
like. Very, very cool. This is from the computer doctor stream. So it reminds me of like a Sunday

340
00:50:57,099 --> 00:51:06,980
morning cartoon panel. Gold plated. Yep. I feel like this should be like a bubble here.

341
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:12,789
This is like panel three or something. You gotta make a statement. You do have,

342
00:51:12,789 --> 00:51:22,039
you gotta make a statement with your computers. Looking for Garfield. Looks like Kramer.

343
00:51:24,019 --> 00:51:40,869
And I'm doing a Kramer right here. That, this is, that's Kramer. Do I look like Kramer? Maybe.

344
00:51:42,019 --> 00:51:51,320
Maybe a little. No, I don't think so. Kind of. No, I don't think so. A little. Not really.

345
00:51:52,199 --> 00:51:58,409
Oh, this is an animation. This person said that they were working on an animation. It's the first

346
00:51:58,409 --> 00:52:03,219
time they've ever animated anything. And they have a little template that they were working on

347
00:52:03,219 --> 00:52:10,340
for. This is a pre carnival stuff. And this is just a little bit of a teaser for what might come

348
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:16,340
later. And we have a little bit of a look here. They were going to do what I, what I assumed was

349
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:22,550
going to be a carnival cartoon with all these little ideas. Does it look real? It just looked

350
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:31,769
cool. So I wanted to look at it. I wanted to show it. What's that called? So you guys gotta help me

351
00:52:31,769 --> 00:52:35,769
out here because I don't know anything about art. What is the thing called when you draw,

352
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:41,610
let's say you're going to draw something. And then the first thing you draw is like all the lines,

353
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:45,369
like lines, lines, lines, lines, lines, lines, lines, lines, lines, and then over what's,

354
00:52:45,369 --> 00:52:53,449
what is that like called when you do that on line work, rough sketch? Does it have anything? Does

355
00:52:53,449 --> 00:53:03,320
it called anything like a rough sketch? Because then you do, you go over it, right? Will we drop

356
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:10,469
in frames? No, we're okay. Cause then you go over that and then you delete, you delete the

357
00:53:10,469 --> 00:53:19,210
layer behind it. Construction lines, early access art. There's like six different terms for it.

358
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:26,840
Structured lines. Okay. Yeah. I always found that interesting because it's almost like you,

359
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,639
you're like building out a skeleton and then you go over the skeleton and then you delete the

360
00:53:31,639 --> 00:53:40,630
skeleton and you keep adding and then you maybe delete that too. It's a DLC sketch. This is cool

361
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:48,579
though. Really cool stuff. That's just me, you know, just, that's just me just looking great.

362
00:53:54,699 --> 00:54:06,650
Try it. I can't do it. Delete your skeleton. Yeah. I think you got it pretty good. I think

363
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:13,500
you got it pretty close. I said my hair is a little longer now, but maybe not before.

364
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:28,179
This is Jerma Chad. That's just, that's just Jerma Jerma. Nice work. Here's some donkey donuts

365
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:31,940
because you're epic. I don't, I don't know. I still don't understand this.

366
00:54:33,139 --> 00:54:43,179
Did this, did this come from this channel? It gets blurry. No. Okay. So this is not,

367
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:51,849
but the Dunkin Donuts thing. Here's some donkey donut because you're epic.

368
00:54:52,570 --> 00:55:09,110
The little rat is great. And I got the Twitch logo on it. I feel like this is something you would do

369
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:14,539
out of Starbucks. If you were like really, really pretentious about your stream.

370
00:55:16,489 --> 00:55:25,449
And what's the name? Twitch.tv slash Jerma985. Okay. And they have to write it on there. And

371
00:55:25,449 --> 00:55:28,489
then you can walk around with it and like you just, people can just see it. I don't know.

372
00:55:29,369 --> 00:55:41,019
People probably do that. Phylactery, let's just say 5,000 bits, 50 bucks from Phylactery. Phylactery,

373
00:55:41,659 --> 00:55:47,659
a lot of money. They're the money king at this point. And they say this,

374
00:55:47,659 --> 00:55:51,579
Hey Jerma, quick question. Do you find it weird that right now your bones are wet?

375
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:59,260
No, not at all. Because the bones are just the thing to protect the meat inside.

376
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:03,960
That's fine. That the bones are the shield for the marrow that's inside of them.

377
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:10,500
I don't care. Do you care when your car gets wet?

378
00:56:11,829 --> 00:56:14,389
No, the car is the shell protecting the meat inside, which is you.

379
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:36,179
I just saw somebody just wrote, he's insane. No, your bones. What do you mean wet? How are they

380
00:56:36,179 --> 00:56:48,570
wet? Okay. You've got skin, muscle, bone, but what the, is muscle wet? I mean, it's maybe,

381
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:56,260
it's maybe damp, like moist, damp. Muscles are not like, they're damp. They're like liquidy, I guess.

382
00:56:57,139 --> 00:57:06,650
But who cares? Because if we weren't, if we weren't like 76% water, then that's fine. That's a,

383
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:12,920
that's the actual question is, is it weird that you are 76% water? I guess, probably.

384
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:17,829
But guess what, guys? You want to talk about some weird, fucked up,

385
00:57:18,389 --> 00:57:41,610
next level meta shit? So is the earth. Weird. This is from the hit and run streams. Bogdanoff's are

386
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:47,699
calling. It's from the hit and run, the Simpson stream. This is from the Spider-Man stream.

387
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:56,949
If you remember when we played Spider-Man, I did. It was very, very good. It's an interesting

388
00:57:56,949 --> 00:58:15,449
depiction. It was, you know, Doc Octopus. That was two years ago. Was it? No, it was not. That

389
00:58:15,449 --> 00:58:21,619
was in, no, that was in Vegas. I've only been in Vegas for a year. That was like five, that was

390
00:58:21,619 --> 00:58:27,420
like six or seven months ago. That was like three or four months ago. That was not that long ago.

391
00:58:28,219 --> 00:58:35,420
It was two years ago. Oh, this is great. I think this actually was the thumbnail for that second

392
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:45,210
Derma video that was made, I think. It was in December. Right. Trying to figure out his own

393
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:54,780
lore. Right, but to be fair, I have an encyclopedia this thick of stuff that I've ever said or done

394
00:58:54,780 --> 00:59:05,050
on camera. And sometimes you gotta cycle to like the S for Simpsons. Okay, there it is. Thick. Okay.

395
00:59:06,489 --> 00:59:20,730
This is Glooman and me. This is great. I love this. Okay, much taller than Glooman, as you see.

396
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:29,619
We have seen this before, but it's worth showing again. This is the old Derma. New Derma shrunk and

397
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:38,780
became... I'm still all right. I'm not going to give you guys any gasoline to dump on that fire.

398
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:45,429
Uh, yeah. But this is, we've seen this one before. It's really good shit. I think this is all made

399
00:59:45,429 --> 00:59:52,980
by the same artist, these two, this one as well. I believe so. Very, very good work. I like the

400
00:59:52,980 --> 01:00:02,199
background here. It makes the foreground pop. Did you guys know that I was... I swear to God,

401
01:00:02,199 --> 01:00:10,250
this is not a lie. This is 100% true. I promise you. I fucking 100% promise. I was an art minor

402
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:27,079
in college with my degree. My degree is an art minor. Yes, that's true. It is. I need to show

403
01:00:27,079 --> 01:00:32,019
you. I don't even know where my degree is. I don't think it's even in this house.

404
01:00:32,739 --> 01:00:41,059
I don't... I don't have my degree. If I ever needed to prove... This is the funniest part.

405
01:00:41,059 --> 01:00:44,739
If I ever like applied for a job somewhere and they were like, oh, can we like see a copy of your

406
01:00:44,739 --> 01:00:52,820
degree? I don't fucking have it. Can I like call the... Can you call the college? Is it like sending

407
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:59,139
you medical documents? Hey, I need you to fax my medical degree, my documents over. You can do

408
01:00:59,139 --> 01:01:04,309
that, right? Is there... Is it like a timeline where you can't do that anymore? What if I graduated

409
01:01:04,309 --> 01:01:14,420
20 years ago? Do they still have it? What if the college... Okay, what if the college

410
01:01:15,659 --> 01:01:25,880
goes under and doesn't exist anymore? Where can I get it? I should get it now then. I'm going to

411
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:37,179
get like five copies of it. Hey, can you send over five copies of my degree just in case you're

412
01:01:37,179 --> 01:01:52,789
screwed? No, I'll be fine. Back to college I go. The state government should have it too. They have...

413
01:01:52,789 --> 01:02:05,380
The state government has everybody's degrees? What was your major? Engineering. Oh, look at this

414
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:15,380
one. This is a cute picture of me and Kim. You know, Kim is my girlfriend. Those of you that

415
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:24,309
might be new, you might not know. And that's me. It's adorable. I'm gonna... I'm gonna hang this

416
01:02:24,309 --> 01:02:31,960
one up. I'm gonna hang them all up. I'm gonna get them as bumper stickers on my car. No, this is

417
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:43,300
great. What I really like here... I'm not gonna say it. No, this is good shit. We've seen this on

418
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:53,400
stream before too. What do you mean egomaniac? Hold on. I'm an egomaniac because some...

419
01:02:55,159 --> 01:02:59,449
What if you... What if somebody took a photo of you and your girlfriend

420
01:03:01,179 --> 01:03:05,670
and they showed it to you and then you're looking at it? Would somebody come over and say that

421
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:16,099
you're an egomaniac? Holy shit, dude. Wait, you took like three... Wait, hold on a minute.

422
01:03:16,099 --> 01:03:22,500
You went on vacation and you have like 10, 20 photos of you on vacation? You fucking egomaniac.

423
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:27,300
Who are those for? I don't know. Why doesn't everybody take pictures? Why doesn't everybody

424
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:41,239
do anything? They're for me. If they were insane and had no concept of social standards.

425
01:03:41,239 --> 01:03:45,320
So me wanting to frame a photo like this and like put it in like, like the fridge or in the

426
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:54,579
bedroom or something. This is like a nice moment. No, egomaniac would be if I told you to edit this

427
01:03:54,579 --> 01:04:04,650
photo and up here write top fucking 500 streamer, wicked sick stream, really talented guy with an

428
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:12,230
arrow pointing over here. Like I have you edit it and do that and put that in or I won't put it up.

429
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:30,550
That's how you make the difference. Please OP. Edit that, please OP. OP? Oh, original poster, right?

430
01:04:31,429 --> 01:04:34,469
Now this is good stuff though. Thank you. Let's keep going.

431
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:52,199
I just played this. I was over on my other monitor and the video portion's coming up.

432
01:04:52,199 --> 01:04:58,230
You didn't hear it. I just played that accidentally but the audio was muted.

433
01:05:01,769 --> 01:05:05,690
There's a video portion coming up here in a little bit and that is the first one.

434
01:05:07,849 --> 01:05:14,809
Anyways, this is a artist depiction of what that image looks like down here.

435
01:05:22,039 --> 01:05:33,690
Frame this one. Now this is a Halloween mask. This is two steps away from BF Bugleberry.

436
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:46,219
It's October. Make 3D print this as a mask. How much would that cost? How much would it cost to

437
01:05:46,219 --> 01:05:50,860
have a company actually make me like a silicone like 3D printed like actual mask of this?

438
01:05:56,019 --> 01:06:08,070
Like $150,000? I don't think so. What is it made out of? Is it made out of like silk?

439
01:06:08,869 --> 01:06:24,869
300 bucks? We'll see. Maybe. This is great though. Thank you. It's good shit. This is from

440
01:06:24,869 --> 01:06:30,869
the Dragon Lair stream. Please save me. This is, I think it's called German Daphne.

441
01:06:32,679 --> 01:06:36,599
The cage is locked with the key. The dragon keeps it around his neck to slay. The dragon

442
01:06:36,599 --> 01:06:53,690
used the magic sword. We saw this I think 150 times. Dragon's Lair.

443
01:06:58,739 --> 01:07:06,440
That was close to a meltdown stream by the way. That was very close. Like I would say like another

444
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:17,639
10% more frustration in that game. I may have lost my mind. It was close. It was a lot of fun

445
01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:24,010
though. It was. But thank you for this. It's great. That's supposed to be me in the glass tube

446
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:42,059
thing. Now this is Jex and I believe this is who made it. This is my Namco light gun. I missed that.

447
01:07:42,059 --> 01:07:48,219
I should have signed it. I should have signed that and like cut the cord off, signed it,

448
01:07:48,219 --> 01:07:53,829
and put it up in my entryway. Just to like have like look at that piece of like history.

449
01:07:54,869 --> 01:08:09,460
Fucking egomaniac. This is Vinnie, right? It's a little gif. It'd be padding. That's Vdub.

450
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:22,760
Oh okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. One of these days maybe they'll team up. I don't know

451
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:33,770
though. I can't determine when he's going to come out. Sometimes he just does. Now that's cute. Very

452
01:08:33,770 --> 01:08:40,390
cool. And then the next one is, I don't know. I don't know the context on these. Learn the

453
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:50,890
difference. It could save your life one day. Vinnie the Jerma. But I'm like sweaty and he's

454
01:08:50,890 --> 01:09:00,140
cool. He's really cool and I'm like sweaty and weird. And then this is Vdub and Jex. Eats veggies

455
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:07,420
is cool and has a has a gun. Taller than Jerma. Jex. Totally better than Vinnie at video games.

456
01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:20,069
So this is Vdub is better than Vinnie. Vdub vapes and just very epic. So wait. So Jex is

457
01:09:20,069 --> 01:09:30,420
better than Jerma? Is that what we're coming to the conclusion of here? No. No, no, no, no, no,

458
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:36,920
no. This is like it's like Vegeta and Goku. You need both of them. Otherwise you're not going to

459
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:49,819
be able to take down Frieza. Give me a break. This is not better or this is the this is the version

460
01:09:49,819 --> 01:10:01,819
of I have to be that. No, no, no, no, no. Need them both. There was what what was the movie?

461
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:09,399
What the fuck was the movie or TV show where the person's all their like alter egos came out. They

462
01:10:09,399 --> 01:10:19,130
had to like um no it's uh the um no not face off what face off is two guys faces switched um

463
01:10:19,689 --> 01:10:32,100
there's a Zelda game where this happens split no no no no no different Zelda Zelda and the four

464
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:37,159
links right like there's like sleepy link and then there's like comedy link and then this like angry

465
01:10:37,159 --> 01:10:48,250
link right and they like split up does that happen no there's something else too it's not

466
01:10:48,329 --> 01:10:56,359
snow white the seven dwarfs did not combine into like a mecha dwarf no jimmy neutron

467
01:11:02,569 --> 01:11:06,090
why would that be so that's too specific i didn't watch jimmy neutron enough to know that

468
01:11:10,380 --> 01:11:26,500
it's the movie called identity the power rangers identity okay you take that's from teen titans

469
01:11:27,989 --> 01:11:36,069
no okay every major cartoon has probably done this every major syndicated cartoon television show

470
01:11:36,069 --> 01:11:42,229
has probably done the you through some weird scientific experiment had like six personalities

471
01:11:42,229 --> 01:11:51,260
come out of you it just depends on which one you want to name this happens in the muppets

472
01:11:52,899 --> 01:12:04,380

473
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:10,729
the same episode what what happened in danny phantom was how do you what was this what was

474
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:18,090
the overarching story arc of danny phantom because i saw like five or six episodes of

475
01:12:18,090 --> 01:12:22,569
danny phantom and they were all the same episode i could i could not take it tell them apart

483
01:13:35,939 --> 01:13:39,939

484
01:13:39,939 --> 01:13:49,100

487
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:21,050
so that's fair enough yeah let's keep going this is uh the ringleader here at germa from the

488
01:14:21,050 --> 01:14:29,779
carnival stream cotton candy the most terrifying aspect of that whole stream was the cotton candy

489
01:14:29,779 --> 01:14:36,760
machine i think i talked about it before but the thing was dangerous and of all the things that

490
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:44,340
were there they were machines that were shooting uh softballs at me and the thing that was the

491
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:51,670
closest thing to me actually getting severely injured was the cotton candy machine we watched

492
01:14:51,670 --> 01:15:09,829
the footage afterwards and we like that's dangerous frog what about the frog the frog is all right the

493
01:15:09,829 --> 01:15:19,590
umbrella yeah still have a i still have a scar on this finger that'll be my next uh uh finger

496
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:50,359
great this is uh i really wish i looked that good because but here's the thing about costumes

497
01:15:52,069 --> 01:15:57,750
when you buy a costume there's an 80 chance that it's going to be made out of a material

498
01:15:57,750 --> 01:16:08,760
that's closer to paper than actual clothing so that hat and that robe were they were barely

499
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:14,659
caught it was that hat was barely a hat i don't know why it's just cheap cheap cheap shit material

500
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:32,939
paper is actually clothing i don't know why this can't make it normal clothes germa venus oh yeah

501
01:16:33,739 --> 01:16:43,699
it wasn't a top hat it was a brimmed sack perfect description it was it was it was a brimmed sack

01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:07,479
uh if you didn't see that stream chat did a wonderful job not winning that game but

554
01:26:08,199 --> 01:26:20,300
hitting me directly in the face there it is i was there i was there no not the slap

555
01:26:22,329 --> 01:26:27,770
uh that was awesome though that was an amazing time thank you for everybody for punching me in

556
01:26:27,770 --> 01:26:34,659
the face now you can say you did that you can say i hit germa in the face and it would not be a lie

557
01:26:34,659 --> 01:26:44,279
it would be true you won this is from my stardew valley streams this is the duck person from

558
01:26:44,279 --> 01:26:58,340
stardew valley it was a long time ago what was this what was this character's name yeah this is

559
01:26:58,340 --> 01:27:02,869
a full probably three or four years ago stardew valley i think is some of the first streams i

560
01:27:02,869 --> 01:27:12,539
ever did it was greg every character is greg greg is my go-to when i don't have anything to think of

561
01:27:12,539 --> 01:27:21,800
it's just greg back to bed i do remember that though what a great game what just what a lovely

562
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:30,039
experience that was i miss it i kind of did everything though and then kim played it again

563
01:27:30,039 --> 01:27:36,039
a couple years ago and she 100 percent of the game and i was watching almost the whole time so

564
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:45,050
i can't really play it again unfortunately and then after that we have a germa heart

565
01:27:45,770 --> 01:27:52,090
except this is a little more uh this is a little more morbid this is a germa stab heart

566
01:27:53,590 --> 01:28:14,600
but it's uh it's really cool nonetheless what monka s why i think it's great i look very angry

567
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:19,210
though and this is not even supposed to be me this is supposed to be the person living up here

577
01:30:42,550 --> 01:30:51,819
seeing some shrek levels of manipulation here like it's shrek but shrek looks like this now

580
01:31:18,979 --> 01:31:27,350
earthbound what are you talking about those are shrek levels of mean creations somebody knows

581
01:31:27,350 --> 01:31:32,390
what i'm talking about here and that person gets it you know sometimes you just get it

582
01:31:39,859 --> 01:31:50,500
making the same face that's my shit eating grin i do it all the time free me

583
01:31:52,100 --> 01:32:02,659
free me that's germa greed then there's a seal and i didn't even know what that was until very

584
01:32:02,659 --> 01:32:08,539
recently i have no idea what that seal is that seal is on some kind of other completely different

585
01:32:08,539 --> 01:32:18,840
journey completely new adventure i did not save that seal that seal is doing this has been

586
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:24,899
released into our wherever they're going to be they have they're on their own with a new life

587
01:32:25,779 --> 01:32:38,220
the seal spy no that's just a regular seal but yeah that's from the carnival inside the money

588
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:46,630
machine it was a lot of fun and this is great i've seen a few of these this is uh the giant rat

589
01:32:46,630 --> 01:32:59,319
it's a fair not a giant rat almost as a kingpin i do like the double cigar that's a nice touch

590
01:33:01,380 --> 01:33:09,140
one for now one for later and this one is the later one as you can see because this one is

591
01:33:09,140 --> 01:33:15,880
being uh dragged down quite a little bit dual welding cigars how about both for now

592
01:33:16,739 --> 01:33:26,039
now you'll puke i gotta give you some advice here cigars are horrible because unlike a cigarette

593
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:32,439
if you smoke a cigar you are going to throw up because it has so much more concentrated

594
01:33:33,399 --> 01:33:40,220
power in it it will you will puke if you smoke if you if you like i'm gonna smoke a full cigar

595
01:33:40,220 --> 01:33:47,210
to my just to my face you'll throw up don't inhale a cigar don't smoke a cigar if you're

596
01:33:47,210 --> 01:33:58,710
going to smoke a cigar don't breathe it in and don't do enough where you puke just don't smoke

597
01:33:58,710 --> 01:34:07,079
that's easy you taste it and then spit it out just don't smoke don't smoke cigars don't be like this

598
01:34:07,079 --> 01:34:17,159
guy he's got two you don't want to do one somebody just wrote something so so incorrect that it's

reference from or two it's it's still a great image now this one this is fucking amazing this

621
01:37:48,869 --> 01:37:59,609
is a very recent stream the fmv night when i was stuck in the rocket wheelchair for 25 minutes

622
01:37:59,609 --> 01:38:06,180
it's probably the hardest i've laughed in a long time at least in the last few weeks last month or

623
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:12,710
two my game was ridiculous that was from fox hunt i believe that's the game right fox hunt

624
01:38:14,380 --> 01:38:31,159
that hurt to watch that hurt to watch imagine how much it hurt to play who's but somebody

625
01:38:31,159 --> 01:38:39,539
eating your pizza what it was hilarious to watch it was it was just an absolute mess but this is a

626
01:38:39,539 --> 01:38:48,119
this is a fantastic just encompasses the entire stream because it was an absolute joke put a

627
01:38:48,119 --> 01:38:51,479
clip of me stuck in the chair if nobody saw that then that's a good opportunity for you to see it

628
01:38:51,479 --> 01:39:00,569
because it was insane nobody has any clips of it oh too bad it's all right and then this is um

629
01:39:01,289 --> 01:39:13,060
what i don't know why i included this i i this was just there it's i don't know it's like me

630
01:39:13,060 --> 01:39:24,539
saying i don't know what this is what a perfect image to go after that that it was okay it's

631
01:39:25,420 --> 01:39:46,439
supposed to be a me doing monkey s as me new emotes no i can't no no no these images in

632
01:39:46,439 --> 01:40:20,199
succession they tell a story this is me back in my coal mining days you kind of have to double

633
01:40:20,199 --> 01:40:26,680
take this one because it looks like a real image for a second and then you realize no it's not

634
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:34,199
it's not at all actually that was from my vibe stream when the stuff that weird charcoal stuff

635
01:40:34,199 --> 01:40:43,289
was melting onto my face he hasn't aged a day look at that hair that hair is disgusting

636
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:55,859
i have such fine hair though that's the thing i have really fine baby fine hair that even the

637
01:40:55,859 --> 01:41:06,649
slightest variable turns it to shit i will go out like this okay and i will look like this i'll take

638
01:41:06,649 --> 01:41:13,850
a step outside and they will be like a six mile per hour wind gust six like maybe five miles per

639
01:41:13,850 --> 01:41:23,369
hour and it just it turns in a second into just madness like this and i'm constantly like fuck

640
01:41:23,369 --> 01:41:33,960
god damn it and i don't wear uh gel i don't do like gel or um hair spray i can't because

641
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:37,399
when i do hair spray this is the one thing that you need to remember about when you put products

642
01:41:37,399 --> 01:41:45,850
in your hair you got to get it out because if you sleep in that shit it goes stays in here and goes

643
01:41:45,930 --> 01:41:52,649
down and just gives you this greasy gross fucking hairline and i just break out all around my whole

644
01:41:52,649 --> 01:42:00,380
hairline so you have to if you go out and you put product in your hair when you come back you have

645
01:42:00,380 --> 01:42:04,939
to shower and sometimes that's a pain in the ass because you're tired and how many times have you

646
01:42:04,939 --> 01:42:10,699
just been like all right it's like it's like 10 11 12 whatever i don't know one two three who knows

647
01:42:10,699 --> 01:42:15,100
how late it is and then you have to go take a shower when you'd rather just go lie down and go

648
01:42:15,100 --> 01:42:27,529
to bed i don't i don't put product in my hair at all use the water-based pomade i it doesn't work

649
01:42:27,529 --> 01:42:43,350
it makes me just look like a sicko not shampoo yeah i shampoo in condition don't go all the way

650
01:42:43,350 --> 01:42:49,539
to the roots so wait you won't no don't go all the way to the roots so you want to put like

651
01:42:49,539 --> 01:42:57,750
like hair gel like here and then when the gust of wind comes through this happens are you ready

652
01:42:57,829 --> 01:43:09,529
if i would do just right here the gust when the gust of wind happens this happens and that's what

653
01:43:09,529 --> 01:43:26,199
i end up with and it's unfixable his hair is fucked no it's just fine it's really fine and

654
01:43:26,199 --> 01:43:31,000
it can't i just let it do whatever it's gonna do but i like it like this i like the way it looks

655
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:45,369
like this i don't want to like shave it off am i sweating probably i liked it shorter i like it

656
01:43:45,369 --> 01:43:51,220
short but i like it like this this is this is how i'm gonna wear it and i'm gonna cut it again

680
01:48:42,739 --> 01:48:54,789
there were a lot of them they were very very good and we have a lot more to see if you put

681
01:48:54,789 --> 01:49:01,130
something this is by the way this is as of last night so this is as of like yesterday so anything

682
01:49:01,130 --> 01:49:07,590
that was put in there yesterday after i essentially went to bed is not in this stream whatever we

683
01:49:08,390 --> 01:49:18,119
stop at at that point going forward is where i pull from so uh nerd neck give me one second

684
01:49:18,920 --> 01:49:23,239
uh that took about two hours all right that's good to know that's good it took about like an

685
01:49:23,239 --> 01:49:30,840
hour and 45 minutes or so where do you do this in the discord there is a public community discord

686
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:38,760
there is a channel called community content nights you put it there this could be there

687
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:43,479
are rules there you got to follow those rules it could be a video content it could be um

688
01:49:44,279 --> 01:49:49,479
photoshopped content it could be original artwork as long as it's put there i will i will go through

689
01:49:49,479 --> 01:49:57,560
that and that's where i pull it through so we're going to move on to the video portion of the

690
01:49:57,560 --> 01:50:03,779
stream it should be probably another couple hours or so i would assume uh and there's deep fakes

691
01:50:03,779 --> 01:50:09,140
in there well you could but that's fine just this rule just as long as you follow the rules

692
01:50:09,140 --> 01:50:16,699
you're going to be fine so give me one second as i switch to the video portion let me just do this

693
01:50:16,699 --> 01:50:23,239
real quick i want to make sure i can actually get it on here and maybe because this is probably

694
01:50:23,239 --> 01:50:26,119
like this is probably just about halfway point maybe just take a little pee break what do you

695

The correcting.

758
02:03:23,329 --> 02:03:26,329
Somebody wrote in the chat, you've said too many things.

02:03:26,329 --> 02:03:28,329
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

I've said too many words.

762
02:03:32,329 --> 02:03:35,140
Correcting, like how fucking neurotic.

763
02:03:35,140 --> 02:03:37,140
Correcting yourself over and over again.

764
02:03:37,140 --> 02:03:39,140
I'm not five, I'm five feet tall.

765

Just fighting internally, like panicking, correcting myself over and over again.

That was fucking hysterical.

770
02:03:52,859 --> 02:03:59,060

I can't.

789
02:05:05,020 --> 02:05:15,899
Turn your lights in your house off too.

790
02:05:35,220 --> 02:05:36,909
No.

791
02:05:36,909 --> 02:05:38,909
Oh, I'm just gonna fi- I'm gonna face this way.

792
02:05:38,909 --> 02:05:40,909

793
02:05:40,909 --> 02:05:45,109
So that I can watch it with you guys and not like over here.

794
02:05:45,109 --> 02:05:48,890
God, that's fucking hysterical.

795
02:05:48,890 --> 02:05:51,260
I've said too many words.

796
02:05:51,260 --> 02:05:58,130
Alright, coming up next is...

797
02:05:58,130 --> 02:06:01,390

This is Get Out Of Town Shot For Shot Remake.

799
02:06:06,569 --> 02:06:09,569
Side by side comparison video.

800
02:06:09,569 --> 02:06:16,670
I don't know how you make this video.

801
02:06:16,670 --> 02:06:19,699
Okay, here we go.

802
02:06:19,699 --> 02:06:20,699
Get Out Of Town.

803
02:06:20,699 --> 02:06:31,579
You didn't actually do this whole thing.

804
02:06:31,579 --> 02:06:38,750
Wait, don't I like strip?

805
02:06:39,750 --> 02:06:52,090
Do you have to do all the movement?

806
02:06:53,090 --> 02:06:54,649
Please don't.

807
02:07:03,199 --> 02:07:04,199
I can't.

808
02:07:17,409 --> 02:07:18,840
I can't.

809
02:07:19,840 --> 02:07:28,800
This is supposed to have taken you a long time to do this.

810
02:07:36,420 --> 02:07:43,010
It's all my fault.

811
02:07:44,010 --> 02:07:48,449
Neck breaking.

812
02:07:48,449 --> 02:08:16,399
Why would you make this?

813
02:08:16,399 --> 02:08:28,619
It is the same.

814
02:08:28,619 --> 02:08:29,619
The same.

815
02:08:29,619 --> 02:08:31,619
It is actually the same video.

816
02:08:32,619 --> 02:08:41,579
Even the looking back and forth.

817
02:08:41,579 --> 02:08:43,579
Even the looking back and forth.

818
02:08:43,579 --> 02:08:46,359
He's like...

819
02:08:46,359 --> 02:08:48,920

820
02:08:48,920 --> 02:08:49,920
SNL.

821
02:08:50,920 --> 02:08:52,920
I can watch this part here.

822
02:08:52,920 --> 02:08:54,920
The most unbelievable part to me is...

823
02:08:55,920 --> 02:08:58,670
Watch the comparison video.

824
02:08:58,670 --> 02:09:00,670
Watch the actual video.

825
02:09:00,670 --> 02:09:01,670
The left and right look right here.

826
02:09:01,670 --> 02:09:02,670
Here it comes.

827
02:09:02,670 --> 02:09:12,420
You had to have studied this for like 12 hours to do that.

828
02:09:12,420 --> 02:09:16,510
That was fucking insane.

829
02:09:16,510 --> 02:09:23,680
Good acting all around.

830
02:09:23,680 --> 02:09:26,939
A 12 hour stream.

831
02:09:26,939 --> 02:09:27,939
Holy shit.

832
02:09:27,939 --> 02:09:30,939
That was called Get Out Of Town Side By Side Comparison.

833
02:09:30,939 --> 02:09:35,659
Yeah, I've got to link these.

834
02:09:35,659 --> 02:09:36,659
Oh no, we already got it, right?

835
02:09:36,659 --> 02:09:37,659
Somebody just spam them.

836
02:09:37,659 --> 02:09:39,659
Just link them when they're done.

837
02:09:39,659 --> 02:09:41,659
Just because I don't have to fucking...

838
02:09:41,659 --> 02:09:42,659
I don't have to do it.

839
02:09:42,659 --> 02:09:50,270
He's an egomaniac.

840
02:09:51,579 --> 02:09:55,800
This is warm now.

841
02:09:55,800 --> 02:10:00,149
That's not even a link.

842
02:10:00,149 --> 02:10:01,149
Alright, I'm just going to do it.

843
02:10:01,149 --> 02:10:02,149
Somebody got it.

844
02:10:06,590 --> 02:10:07,590
My stomach hurts from laughing.

845
02:10:07,590 --> 02:10:09,590
We're just getting started, by the way.

846
02:10:09,590 --> 02:10:11,859
Give them a like.

847
02:10:11,859 --> 02:10:13,859
I'm not even logged in.

848
02:10:13,859 --> 02:10:16,159
This is my Chrome account.

849
02:10:16,159 --> 02:10:17,159
I'm not logged in.

850
02:10:17,159 --> 02:10:18,850
You do it.

851
02:10:18,850 --> 02:10:19,850
You do it.

852
02:10:19,850 --> 02:10:22,409
Fucking unbelievable.

853
02:10:22,409 --> 02:10:24,710
You guys just keep getting better.

854
02:10:24,710 --> 02:10:26,710
That's the scary thing.

855
02:10:26,710 --> 02:10:27,710
You know what I mean?

856
02:10:27,710 --> 02:10:31,949
You guys just continue to get better at doing this shit.

857
02:10:31,949 --> 02:10:38,119
Let's keep going.

858
02:10:38,119 --> 02:10:45,409
This is called Leaked Trailer For Alien Compact Isolation 2.

859
02:10:45,409 --> 02:10:50,779
If you're ready, let's kick it off

860
02:10:50,779 --> 02:10:52,779
and to get an update from our friends

861
02:10:52,779 --> 02:10:54,779
at one of the most celebrated development studios

862
02:10:54,779 --> 02:10:56,779
in the world, Bethesda Game Studios.

863
02:10:56,779 --> 02:10:58,779
Please welcome Studio Head

864
02:10:58,779 --> 02:11:00,779
and my good friend, Todd Howard.

865
02:11:01,779 --> 02:11:10,359
Are there any gamers in here?

866
02:11:10,359 --> 02:11:12,859
Of course there is.

867
02:11:14,479 --> 02:11:16,479
We've got quite a lineup this year.

868
02:11:16,479 --> 02:11:21,420
Last year we saw some of the best games

869
02:11:21,420 --> 02:11:25,420
highly reviewed that we've ever had as a company here.

870
02:11:25,420 --> 02:11:27,420
And we have you all to thank.

871
02:11:27,420 --> 02:11:34,239
Our average Metacritic score reached over 58.

872
02:11:36,239 --> 02:11:41,439
And I find it completely necessary

873
02:11:41,439 --> 02:11:45,439
to now show you, the fans,

874
02:11:45,439 --> 02:11:48,439
a brand new experience

875
02:11:48,439 --> 02:11:50,439
that you won't have anywhere else.

876
02:11:50,439 --> 02:11:53,319
World Premiere.

877
02:11:53,319 --> 02:11:54,319
Nobody fucking knew.

878
02:11:54,319 --> 02:11:55,319
I need to pause it.

879
02:11:55,319 --> 02:11:56,319
Wait, wait, wait.

880
02:11:56,319 --> 02:11:58,319
I need to pause it for one second.

881
02:11:58,319 --> 02:12:00,319
I think this is like the first or second time

882
02:12:00,319 --> 02:12:02,319
anyone has ever used this footage.

883
02:12:02,319 --> 02:12:04,689
Nobody used that

884
02:12:04,689 --> 02:12:07,689
because it has no context for anything.

885
02:12:07,689 --> 02:12:14,260
The socks, the white socks.

886
02:12:14,260 --> 02:12:17,260
Now show you, the fans,

887
02:12:17,260 --> 02:12:20,750
a brand new experience

888
02:12:20,750 --> 02:12:23,819
that you won't have anywhere else.

889
02:12:23,819 --> 02:12:28,880
World Premiere.

890
02:12:28,880 --> 02:12:31,880
So I guess you need to explore in this game.

891
02:12:31,880 --> 02:12:33,880
There was a crash. Oh no.

892
02:12:33,880 --> 02:12:35,880
Investigate the mystery of the crash.

893
02:12:35,880 --> 02:12:37,880
Which is what I plan on doing.

894
02:12:37,880 --> 02:12:39,880
Let's go ahead and go...

895
02:12:39,880 --> 02:12:42,819
Oh fuck.

896
02:12:42,819 --> 02:12:44,130
That's him.

897
02:12:44,130 --> 02:12:45,130
Can I get away without him seeing?

898
02:12:45,130 --> 02:12:47,130
That's the main thing that's got to be...

899
02:12:47,130 --> 02:12:49,130
No, no, he's right behind me.

900
02:12:49,130 --> 02:12:51,130
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

901
02:12:51,130 --> 02:12:53,130
If I can make it up these stairs, please.

902
02:12:53,130 --> 02:12:55,130
It's an alien.

903
02:12:55,130 --> 02:12:57,130
It's a fucking alien.

904
02:12:57,130 --> 02:13:00,140
Where is he? Where'd he go?

905
02:13:00,140 --> 02:13:05,640
The doors are all locked.

906
02:13:05,640 --> 02:13:07,640
I'm trapped in this spooky game.

907
02:13:07,640 --> 02:13:08,640
What do I do?

908
02:13:08,640 --> 02:13:09,640
Oh, I guess I could climb in here.

909
02:13:09,640 --> 02:13:10,640
It's an old video.

910
02:13:10,640 --> 02:13:13,069
Turn my flashlight on.

911
02:13:13,069 --> 02:13:14,069
An achievement. Nice.

912
02:13:14,069 --> 02:13:15,069
You know, I love getting achievements.

913
02:13:15,069 --> 02:13:17,069
Especially when...

914
02:13:17,069 --> 02:13:18,069
There he is. There he is again.

915
02:13:18,069 --> 02:13:19,069
He's in the vent.

916
02:13:19,069 --> 02:13:20,069
He's in the vent. He's in the vent.

917
02:13:20,069 --> 02:13:21,069
Get out of the vent.

918
02:13:21,069 --> 02:13:22,069
Out of the vent. Down the stairs.

919
02:13:22,069 --> 02:13:23,069
Through the metal detectors.

920
02:13:23,069 --> 02:13:25,069
Hopefully I don't have any weapons.

921
02:13:25,069 --> 02:13:27,069
Okay, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

922
02:13:27,069 --> 02:13:29,069
Straight down, straight down, straight down the stairs.

923
02:13:31,069 --> 02:13:32,069
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

924
02:13:32,069 --> 02:13:33,069
I know you can hide.

925
02:13:33,069 --> 02:13:34,069
Hide in here.

926
02:13:34,069 --> 02:13:35,069
Open it.

927
02:13:35,069 --> 02:13:37,069
Okay.

928
02:13:37,069 --> 02:13:38,439
Shh, quiet in here.

929
02:13:38,439 --> 02:13:39,439
I don't want to...

930
02:13:39,439 --> 02:13:41,439
If I make any noise, I'm going to be in a lot of trouble.

931
02:13:41,439 --> 02:13:43,439
God, there he is.

932
02:13:43,439 --> 02:13:45,739
Please don't come in here and kill me.

933
02:13:45,739 --> 02:13:48,109
What the fuck is he doing?

934
02:13:48,109 --> 02:13:52,189
That's psycho.

935
02:13:52,189 --> 02:13:53,189
What is it?

936
02:13:53,189 --> 02:13:54,189
Do you eat ass?

937
02:13:54,189 --> 02:13:56,579
Do you eat ass?

938
02:13:56,579 --> 02:13:57,579
Oh, that's the archive.

939
02:13:57,579 --> 02:13:59,579
If you're ready, let's do the...

940
02:14:02,659 --> 02:14:03,659
I was going to say this one more time.

941
02:14:03,659 --> 02:14:05,659
Are there any gamers in here?

942
02:14:05,659 --> 02:14:07,470
Of course there is.

943
02:14:07,470 --> 02:14:10,609
That's my favorite part.

944
02:14:10,609 --> 02:14:11,979
Oh.

945
02:14:11,979 --> 02:14:15,220
That was a leaked trailer for Alien Compact Isolation 2.

946
02:14:15,220 --> 02:14:24,430
It's just me.

947
02:14:29,050 --> 02:14:30,050
Okay.

948
02:14:30,050 --> 02:14:31,050
We need a link for that one.

949
02:14:31,050 --> 02:14:32,050
All right.

950
02:14:32,050 --> 02:14:33,050
I'll get you a link.

951
02:14:33,050 --> 02:14:35,050
I'm going to be lightheaded by the end of this stream, I swear.

952
02:14:35,050 --> 02:14:38,060
I'll get you a link.

953
02:14:38,060 --> 02:14:40,739
I don't want you to see how many videos are left, though.

954
02:14:40,739 --> 02:14:43,069
You know what I mean?

955
02:14:43,069 --> 02:14:45,069
I don't want you to see how many videos are left.

956
02:14:45,069 --> 02:14:48,659
That spoils everything.

957
02:14:48,659 --> 02:14:56,939
All right.

958
02:14:56,939 --> 02:14:59,180
So this next one is...

959
02:14:59,180 --> 02:15:02,930
This is German95GermAnimatedFanArt.

960
02:15:02,930 --> 02:15:04,930
This is actually ridiculous.

961
02:15:04,930 --> 02:15:05,930
You guys ready for this?

962
02:15:05,930 --> 02:15:07,930
It's a very short video, but check this out.

963
02:15:07,930 --> 02:15:15,710
That's like Slimer from Ghostbusters.

964
02:15:15,710 --> 02:15:22,750
That's a real 3D shit.

965
02:15:22,750 --> 02:15:28,260
It's really impressive.

966
02:15:28,260 --> 02:15:35,680
I like the lighting inside the mouth.

967
02:15:35,680 --> 02:15:39,989
Look at that.

968
02:15:39,989 --> 02:15:40,989
Let's do it one more time.

969
02:15:40,989 --> 02:15:47,439
The tongue coming out of the mouth.

970
02:15:47,439 --> 02:15:48,439
What made the Simpsons writing...

971
02:15:48,439 --> 02:15:49,439
I don't know.

972
02:15:49,439 --> 02:15:50,439
What made the Simpsons writing so special?

973
02:15:50,439 --> 02:15:52,439
Maybe you'll find out one day.

974
02:15:52,439 --> 02:15:53,439
Here's a link to that one.

975
02:15:53,439 --> 02:15:55,439
It's called the German95GermAnimatedFanArt.

976
02:15:55,439 --> 02:16:00,069
Here it is.

977
02:16:00,069 --> 02:16:01,069
Yeah, take a look at the top.

978
02:16:01,069 --> 02:16:02,069
Actually, you can't even see the top.

979
02:16:02,069 --> 02:16:03,069
Oh, fuck yeah.

980
02:16:03,069 --> 02:16:04,069
There is it.

981
02:16:04,069 --> 02:16:06,210
I'm not going to...

982
02:16:06,210 --> 02:16:09,210
No, we have like 40 videos to watch.

983
02:16:09,210 --> 02:16:11,210
I'm not watching a Simpsons breakdown

984
02:16:11,210 --> 02:16:15,210
of why the writing degraded after season four.

985
02:16:15,210 --> 02:16:18,220
You could put that on a playlist

986
02:16:18,220 --> 02:16:20,220
and listen to it in your car.

987
02:16:20,220 --> 02:16:21,579
All right.

988
02:16:21,579 --> 02:16:22,579
Let's keep going.

989
02:16:22,579 --> 02:16:29,739
Coming up next is Germa and the...

990
02:16:29,739 --> 02:16:30,739
This is a Dreams level.

991
02:16:30,739 --> 02:16:31,739
I think we've already seen this,

992
02:16:31,739 --> 02:16:32,739
but I want to show it one more time

993
02:16:32,739 --> 02:16:33,739
because it's crazy.

994
02:16:33,739 --> 02:16:36,739
This is Germa and the Bee from Dreams.

995
02:16:36,739 --> 02:16:38,940
A game that I abandoned

996
02:16:38,940 --> 02:16:40,940
because I was not good at it.

997
02:16:40,940 --> 02:16:47,100
Turned up.

998
02:16:47,100 --> 02:16:51,739
Guide the bee to Germa's iced coffee

999
02:16:51,739 --> 02:16:52,739
within 30 seconds.

1000
02:16:52,739 --> 02:16:53,739
Are you serious?

1001
02:16:53,739 --> 02:17:04,979
Holy shit, there's a bee in here.

1002
02:17:04,979 --> 02:17:06,979
Star Wars.

1003
02:17:06,979 --> 02:17:07,979
I didn't even pick up.

1004
02:17:07,979 --> 02:17:11,979
The Star Wars is just text floating in front of me.

1005
02:17:11,979 --> 02:17:15,120
That's so funny.

1006
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:17,120
You can't get it on a shirt.

1007
02:17:17,120 --> 02:17:33,760
Bumping into stuff?

1008
02:17:33,760 --> 02:17:39,540
What's...

1009
02:17:39,540 --> 02:17:40,540
Who's up in smoke?

1010
02:17:40,540 --> 02:17:41,540
You see that?

1011
02:17:41,540 --> 02:17:42,540
Look at these pogchamps.

1012
02:17:42,540 --> 02:17:44,540
Oh, he's dead.

1013
02:17:44,540 --> 02:17:51,739
What?

1014
02:17:51,739 --> 02:17:52,739
Are you serious?

1015
02:17:52,739 --> 02:17:55,809
Holy shit, there's a bee in here.

1016
02:17:55,809 --> 02:17:56,809
Oh, fuck me.

1017
02:17:56,809 --> 02:17:59,500
Goodbye.

1018
02:17:59,500 --> 02:18:00,500
Something about a bee,

1019
02:18:00,500 --> 02:18:01,500
it's just...

1020
02:18:01,500 --> 02:18:02,500
It's always scary.

1021
02:18:02,500 --> 02:18:03,500
Always.

1022
02:18:03,500 --> 02:18:05,860
And I know, save the bees.

1023
02:18:05,860 --> 02:18:08,100
The bees are so important to us.

1024
02:18:08,100 --> 02:18:09,100
But they're terrifying

1025
02:18:09,100 --> 02:18:17,739
just because you know what they're capable of.

1026
02:18:17,739 --> 02:18:19,739
The running animation is just like...

1027
02:18:19,739 --> 02:18:21,750
Do you win?

1028
02:18:21,750 --> 02:18:22,750
Do you beat it?

1029
02:18:22,750 --> 02:18:26,229
Get in that iced coffee.

1030
02:18:26,229 --> 02:18:27,229
Let's go.

1031
02:18:27,229 --> 02:18:29,500
Nice.

1032
02:18:29,500 --> 02:18:41,780
What's in the trash can?

1033
02:18:41,780 --> 02:18:46,100
Wait, that's not...

1034
02:18:46,100 --> 02:18:51,020
Wait, that's the coffee cup.

1035
02:18:51,020 --> 02:18:52,649
Oh, that's the cup.

1036
02:18:52,649 --> 02:18:53,649
Right, okay.

1037
02:18:53,649 --> 02:18:54,649
Stupid.

1038
02:18:54,649 --> 02:18:55,649
Idiot.

1039
02:18:55,649 --> 02:18:56,649
Moron.

1040
02:18:56,649 --> 02:18:57,649
Dumb.

1041
02:18:57,649 --> 02:18:58,649
Pathetic.

1042
02:18:58,649 --> 02:18:59,649
Okay, let's keep going.

1043
02:18:59,649 --> 02:19:00,889
That was Germa and the Bee.

1044
02:19:00,889 --> 02:19:01,889
Let's get you a link.

1045
02:19:01,889 --> 02:19:11,680
Very, very good shit so far.

1046
02:19:11,680 --> 02:19:14,010
What do we got next?

1047
02:19:14,010 --> 02:19:18,020
This is Germamari Damacy.

1048
02:19:18,020 --> 02:19:22,409
Apparently it's from an old advertisement for Katamari.

1049
02:19:22,409 --> 02:19:25,719
Let's find out.

1050
02:19:25,719 --> 02:19:26,719
Where is it?

1051
02:19:26,719 --> 02:19:27,719
Where's my guy?

1052
02:19:27,719 --> 02:19:28,719
There he is, right there.

1053
02:19:28,719 --> 02:19:29,719
Where's my guy?

1054
02:19:29,719 --> 02:19:30,719
Where's my guy?

1055
02:19:30,719 --> 02:19:32,719
Get back!

1056
02:19:32,719 --> 02:19:33,719
Come here!

1057
02:19:33,719 --> 02:19:35,149
They dropped it!

1058
02:19:35,149 --> 02:19:38,250
Get out of the fucking way!

1059
02:19:38,250 --> 02:19:39,250
I'm in the middle of a check...

1060
02:19:39,250 --> 02:19:40,250
That's all I hear.

1061
02:19:40,250 --> 02:19:41,250
That's all I hear.

1062
02:19:41,250 --> 02:19:42,250
Shut up.

1063
02:19:42,250 --> 02:19:43,250
Shut up.

1064
02:19:43,250 --> 02:19:49,219
Get in your car.

1065
02:19:49,219 --> 02:19:50,219
Get in your car.

1066
02:19:50,219 --> 02:19:51,219
What?

1067
02:19:51,219 --> 02:19:52,590
What is that?

1068
02:19:52,590 --> 02:19:54,149
I think I was going to catch it.

1069
02:19:54,149 --> 02:19:55,149
Hey, that's right.

1070
02:19:55,149 --> 02:20:00,489
Really?

1071
02:20:00,489 --> 02:20:01,489
Are you serious?

1072
02:20:01,489 --> 02:20:02,489
Shit, it worked.

1073
02:20:02,489 --> 02:20:03,489
Go fuck yourself.

1074
02:20:03,489 --> 02:20:04,489
What's up, man?

1075
02:20:04,489 --> 02:20:05,489
What's up, man?

1076
02:20:05,489 --> 02:20:08,069
What's up, man?

1077
02:20:08,069 --> 02:20:15,329
What's up, man?

1078
02:20:15,329 --> 02:20:16,329
What's up, man?

1079
02:20:16,329 --> 02:20:17,329
What's up, man?

1080
02:20:17,329 --> 02:20:26,120
What's up, man?

1081
02:20:26,120 --> 02:20:27,120
What's up, man?

1082
02:20:27,120 --> 02:20:32,899
What's up, man?

1083
02:20:32,899 --> 02:20:38,620
What's up, man?

1084
02:20:38,620 --> 02:20:39,620
What's up, man?

1085
02:20:39,620 --> 02:20:40,620
What's up, man?

1086
02:20:40,620 --> 02:20:41,620
What's up, man?

1087
02:20:41,620 --> 02:20:42,620
What's up, man?

1088
02:20:42,620 --> 02:20:43,620
What's up, man?

1089
02:20:43,620 --> 02:20:44,620
What's up, man?

1090
02:20:44,620 --> 02:20:45,620
What's up, man?

1091
02:20:45,620 --> 02:20:46,620
What's up, man?

1092
02:20:46,620 --> 02:20:47,620
What's up, man?

1093
02:20:47,620 --> 02:20:50,399
What's up, man?

1094
02:20:50,399 --> 02:20:51,399
What's up, man?

1095
02:20:51,399 --> 02:20:52,399
What's up, man?

1096
02:20:52,399 --> 02:20:53,399
What's up, man?

1097
02:20:53,399 --> 02:20:54,399
What's up, man?

1098
02:20:54,399 --> 02:20:55,399
What's up, man?

1099
02:20:55,399 --> 02:20:56,399
What's up, man?

1100
02:20:56,399 --> 02:20:57,399
What's up, man?

1101
02:20:57,399 --> 02:20:58,399
What's up, man?

1102
02:20:58,399 --> 02:20:59,399
What's up, man?

1103
02:20:59,399 --> 02:21:00,399
What's up, man?

1104
02:21:00,399 --> 02:21:01,399
What's up, man?

1105
02:21:01,399 --> 02:21:04,110
What's up, man?

1106
02:21:04,110 --> 02:21:05,110
What's up, man?

1107
02:21:05,110 --> 02:21:06,110
What's up, man?

1108
02:21:06,110 --> 02:21:07,110
What's up, man?

1109
02:21:07,110 --> 02:21:08,110
What's up, man?

1110
02:21:08,110 --> 02:21:09,110
What's up, man?

1111
02:21:09,110 --> 02:21:11,250
What's up, man?

1112
02:21:15,299 --> 02:21:16,299
I'm in the middle of a cha-

1113
02:21:16,299 --> 02:21:17,299
That's all I hear.

1114
02:21:17,299 --> 02:21:18,670
That's all I hear.

1115
02:21:18,670 --> 02:21:20,299
Shut up.

1116
02:21:20,299 --> 02:21:25,819
Shut up.

1117
02:21:25,819 --> 02:21:30,049
Get in your car.

1118
02:21:30,049 --> 02:21:32,290
That's fucking funny.

1119
02:21:32,290 --> 02:21:33,290
Why am I so mean?

1120
02:21:33,290 --> 02:21:34,290
I'm not.

1121
02:21:34,290 --> 02:21:35,290
I'm just...

1122
02:21:35,290 --> 02:21:36,590
This is the Katamari guy.

1123
02:21:36,590 --> 02:21:37,590
That's not me.

1124
02:21:37,590 --> 02:21:40,600
That was fucking fantastic.

1125
02:21:40,600 --> 02:21:49,540
Here it is.

1126
02:21:49,540 --> 02:21:52,319
What's next?

1127
02:21:52,319 --> 02:21:53,319
Another one of these.

1128
02:21:58,629 --> 02:22:03,370
Suck a fart out of my ass.

1129
02:22:04,370 --> 02:22:08,139
Alright, that was that one.

1130
02:22:08,139 --> 02:22:09,139
It's called S stands for...

1131
02:22:11,139 --> 02:22:14,659
Suck a fart out of my ass.

1132
02:22:17,170 --> 02:22:19,170
Do you want me to even link this one?

1133
02:22:19,170 --> 02:22:30,569
There you go.

1134
02:22:30,569 --> 02:22:33,569
This is the Life and Times of German985.

1135
02:22:33,569 --> 02:22:44,299
Based on the DOS Alter Ego stream.

1136
02:22:44,299 --> 02:22:51,139
Oh, this is my entire life.

1137
02:23:01,299 --> 02:23:03,299
Is this me reaching out to my old self?

1138
02:23:03,299 --> 02:23:14,100
That's me.

1139
02:23:14,100 --> 02:23:15,100
I mean, that is me.

1140
02:23:15,100 --> 02:23:18,750
What happened in this stream?

1141
02:23:18,750 --> 02:23:31,729
What the fuck is this?

1142
02:23:31,729 --> 02:23:33,729
Was this part of the stream?

1143
02:23:33,729 --> 02:23:46,170
He forgot...

1144
02:23:46,170 --> 02:23:48,170
Oh, right, right.

1145
02:23:48,170 --> 02:24:01,540
It's me on the bench.

1146
02:24:01,540 --> 02:24:03,540
Why?

1147
02:24:03,540 --> 02:24:48,409
I had a heart attack on the baseball field and died.

1148
02:24:48,409 --> 02:24:50,409
I remember.

1149
02:24:51,409 --> 02:24:59,600
Thanks for watching.

1150
02:24:59,600 --> 02:25:09,540
That was the Life and Times of German985 from the DOS stream Alter Ego.

1151
02:25:09,540 --> 02:25:20,430
Sometimes I forget all this shit and it's instantly reminding me.

1152
02:25:20,430 --> 02:25:26,020
He got old real quick.

1153
02:25:26,020 --> 02:25:27,020
Yeah.

1154
02:25:27,020 --> 02:25:28,020
34.

1155
02:25:28,020 --> 02:25:29,020
I look like fucking 80.

1156
02:25:29,020 --> 02:25:32,700
What's next?

1157
02:25:32,700 --> 02:25:34,700
Alright, let's keep going.

1158
02:25:34,700 --> 02:25:39,639
This is Vine Wrestle, a German story.

1159
02:25:39,639 --> 02:25:42,860
Alright.

1160
02:25:42,860 --> 02:26:00,379
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to Vine Wrestle.

1161
02:26:00,379 --> 02:26:08,860
If this is your first Vine Wrestle, it is the sauciest wrestle event you'll ever see.

1162
02:26:08,860 --> 02:26:09,860
It's Joel.

1163
02:26:09,860 --> 02:26:15,139
Dookie Nookie, Dick Hickam.

1164
02:26:15,139 --> 02:26:20,450
It's time to chew ass, and I'm all out of ass.

1165
02:26:20,450 --> 02:26:21,450
It'll be real good.

1166
02:26:21,450 --> 02:26:29,639
It's been a long-awaited Vine Wrestle.

1167
02:26:29,639 --> 02:26:32,639
It's a sacred Vine Wrestle community event.

1168
02:26:32,639 --> 02:26:33,639
I invaded.

1169
02:26:33,639 --> 02:26:34,639
And you bet.

1170
02:26:34,639 --> 02:26:36,639
It's going to get real exciting.

1171
02:26:36,639 --> 02:26:39,639
Lots of new exciting things happening this year.

1172
02:26:39,639 --> 02:26:43,479
Before we do that.

1173
02:26:43,479 --> 02:26:52,629
Be a part of this wrestling event.

1174
02:26:52,629 --> 02:26:55,629
Because I'm Mr. Wrestling Event.

1175
02:26:55,629 --> 02:26:56,629
That's right.

1176
02:26:56,629 --> 02:26:57,629
German Rumble.

1177
02:26:57,629 --> 02:26:58,629
German Rumble 2.

1178
02:26:58,629 --> 02:26:59,629
German Rumble 3.

1179
02:26:59,629 --> 02:27:00,629
German Rumble Life.

1180
02:27:00,629 --> 02:27:02,629
German Rumble Rumble House.

1181
02:27:02,629 --> 02:27:03,629
The Sims one.

1182
02:27:03,629 --> 02:27:04,629
Nobody really liked that one.

1183
02:27:04,629 --> 02:27:05,629
I did.

1184
02:27:05,629 --> 02:27:06,629
But that's five.

1185
02:27:06,629 --> 02:27:09,629
I got six somewhere, too.

1186
02:27:09,629 --> 02:27:11,639
I do.

1187
02:27:11,639 --> 02:27:12,639
Somewhere.

1188
02:27:12,639 --> 02:27:15,799
Stop moving.

1189
02:27:15,799 --> 02:27:16,799
Stop the moves.

1190
02:27:16,799 --> 02:27:17,799
This is important stuff.

1191
02:27:17,799 --> 02:27:22,750
Boom.

1192
02:27:22,750 --> 02:27:23,750
I did everything possible.

1193
02:27:23,750 --> 02:27:38,309
I just wanted to come in and prove to the world that I had an enemy to do it.

1194
02:27:38,309 --> 02:27:40,309
I really didn't.

1195
02:27:40,309 --> 02:27:44,309
I really did not mean to do that.

1196
02:27:44,309 --> 02:27:45,309
Listen.

1197
02:27:45,309 --> 02:27:50,200
How do you think I'm going to get out too when you're gone?

1198
02:27:50,200 --> 02:27:51,200
Take me for everything.

1199
02:27:51,200 --> 02:27:57,100
Me out of my own.

1200
02:27:57,100 --> 02:28:01,000
It is time to hit the road.

1201
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,260
Oh, the F.A.W.D.

1202
02:28:03,260 --> 02:28:04,260
The F.A.W.D.

1203
02:28:04,260 --> 02:28:05,260
Belt was fake.

1204
02:28:05,260 --> 02:28:09,959
Hang up on him.

1205
02:28:09,959 --> 02:28:10,959
Hold on.

1206
02:28:10,959 --> 02:28:12,389
Wait.

1207
02:28:12,389 --> 02:28:13,389
Hold on.

1208
02:28:13,389 --> 02:28:14,389
Wait.

1209
02:28:14,389 --> 02:28:16,459
Hang up on him.

1210
02:28:16,459 --> 02:28:24,139
You can hear the Super Mario RPG music in the background.

1211
02:28:24,139 --> 02:28:25,139
Listen.

1212
02:28:25,139 --> 02:28:28,739
Yeah.

1213
02:28:28,739 --> 02:28:29,739
Yeah.

1214
02:28:29,739 --> 02:28:35,979
Those of you that don't know, on the Vine Wrestle, I invaded.

1215
02:28:35,979 --> 02:28:37,979
I was not supposed to.

1216
02:28:37,979 --> 02:28:40,979
I really didn't want to win.

1217
02:28:40,979 --> 02:28:43,350
I just kept winning.

1218
02:28:43,350 --> 02:28:47,350
I just kept winning no matter what they threw at me.

1219
02:28:47,350 --> 02:28:54,219
I won every single time with a fake belt, though.

1220
02:28:54,219 --> 02:28:56,219
I should have known.

1221
02:28:56,219 --> 02:28:58,399
It looked a little weird.

1222
02:28:58,399 --> 02:28:59,399
I should have known.

1223
02:28:59,399 --> 02:29:01,399
He told me it was official, but you know, crayon.

1224
02:29:01,399 --> 02:29:04,399
It was just red crayon on the belt.

1225
02:29:04,399 --> 02:29:05,399
I just thought that's what they did there.

1226
02:29:05,399 --> 02:29:07,399
I was like, oh, this is like a joke.

1227
02:29:07,399 --> 02:29:09,399
They do like, it's a funny joke belt.

1228
02:29:09,399 --> 02:29:14,459
Maybe we'll see it again.

1229
02:29:14,459 --> 02:29:16,399
Maybe we'll see you next time.

1230
02:29:16,399 --> 02:29:18,790
Maybe.

1231
02:29:18,790 --> 02:29:19,790
We'll find out.

1232
02:29:19,790 --> 02:29:23,340
But that was Vine Wrestle.

1233
02:29:23,340 --> 02:29:24,340
It was a great event.

1234
02:29:24,340 --> 02:29:27,340
I was absolutely thrilled to be a part of it.

1235
02:29:27,340 --> 02:29:29,340
And I fucking won.

1236
02:29:29,340 --> 02:29:30,829
This guy.

1237
02:29:30,829 --> 02:29:31,829
I won.

1238
02:29:31,829 --> 02:29:34,649
Let's get you the link to that one.

1239
02:29:34,649 --> 02:29:38,450
Look at me.

1240
02:29:38,450 --> 02:29:44,020
It actually was a true look at me moment without a single doubt in my mind.

1241
02:29:44,020 --> 02:29:45,020
Coming up next.

1242
02:29:45,020 --> 02:29:50,219
This is called, Jerma Gets Back in Shape.

1243
02:29:50,219 --> 02:29:52,219
I'm looking forward to this one.

1244
02:29:52,219 --> 02:29:54,219
I want to see how I do it.

1245
02:29:54,219 --> 02:29:57,489
Do two headphones in for this one.

1246
02:29:57,489 --> 02:29:58,489
Come on.

1247
02:29:58,489 --> 02:30:24,559
What am I thinking?

1248
02:30:24,559 --> 02:30:50,700
How long is this video?

1249
02:30:50,700 --> 02:30:54,700
Do you want to send a car song?

1250
02:30:54,700 --> 02:30:57,700
I don't either.

1251
02:30:57,700 --> 02:31:04,290
Let's get it started right here.

1252
02:31:04,290 --> 02:31:10,010
Preview.

1253
02:31:10,010 --> 02:31:11,010
Preview.

1254
02:31:16,590 --> 02:31:29,819
Preview.

1255
02:31:29,819 --> 02:31:38,090
This is really coffee?

1256
02:31:38,090 --> 02:31:39,090
Jesus.

1257
02:31:39,090 --> 02:31:52,129
That's so loud.

1258
02:31:52,129 --> 02:31:54,129
I almost just ripped my pants.

1259
02:31:54,129 --> 02:31:56,010
Me too.

1260
02:31:56,010 --> 02:31:58,569
I was supposed to rip it out.

1261
02:31:58,569 --> 02:32:00,569
Holy shit.

1262
02:32:02,569 --> 02:32:04,569
I thought you were in jeans.

1263
02:32:04,569 --> 02:32:05,569
To the gym.

1264
02:32:05,569 --> 02:32:26,260
Jerma saves the galaxy.

1265
02:32:26,260 --> 02:32:27,260
What the fuck is this?

1266
02:32:27,260 --> 02:32:34,139
The time has come.

1267
02:32:34,139 --> 02:32:35,139
Wait.

1268
02:32:35,139 --> 02:32:36,139
Hold on.

1269
02:32:36,139 --> 02:32:37,139
Have you ever seen any Marvel movies?

1270
02:32:37,139 --> 02:32:38,139
Don't watch.

1271
02:32:38,139 --> 02:32:39,309
I don't know what this is.

1272
02:32:39,309 --> 02:32:42,309
There is a Marvel movie in here.

1273
02:32:42,309 --> 02:32:43,309
Somebody gets injured.

1274
02:32:43,309 --> 02:32:44,309
Somebody might get hurt.

1275
02:32:44,309 --> 02:32:45,309
Somebody might die.

1276
02:32:45,309 --> 02:32:46,309
But I don't know.

1277
02:32:46,309 --> 02:32:51,069
Oh, wait.

1278
02:32:51,069 --> 02:32:52,069
This is like a Disney movie.

1279
02:32:52,069 --> 02:32:58,899
Let's just get to the part where I'm in it.

1280
02:32:58,899 --> 02:32:59,899
This is a spoiler.

1281
02:32:59,899 --> 02:33:03,899
If you don't want to see Marvel movie spoilers, close your eyes and block your ears for 30

1282
02:33:03,899 --> 02:33:04,899
seconds starting now.

1283
02:33:04,899 --> 02:33:05,899
Do it now.

1284
02:33:05,899 --> 02:33:06,899
Now.

1285
02:33:06,899 --> 02:33:12,219
Now.

1286
02:33:12,219 --> 02:33:13,219
Now.

1287
02:33:13,219 --> 02:33:14,459
I just ripped my pants.

1288
02:33:14,459 --> 02:33:16,459
We don't need to watch anymore at this point.

1289
02:33:16,459 --> 02:33:18,459
I can't do it anymore.

1290
02:33:18,459 --> 02:33:20,600
Hey.

1291
02:33:20,600 --> 02:33:21,600
Hey.

1292
02:33:21,600 --> 02:33:22,600
It's.

1293
02:33:22,600 --> 02:33:23,600
Tim.

1294
02:33:23,600 --> 02:33:24,600
Tim.

1295
02:33:24,600 --> 02:33:25,600
Oh my god.

1296
02:33:25,600 --> 02:33:26,600
It's good to see you.

1297
02:33:26,600 --> 02:33:27,600
Thanks, man.

1298
02:33:27,600 --> 02:33:28,600
Yeah.

1299
02:33:28,600 --> 02:33:29,600
It's great to see you again.

1300
02:33:29,600 --> 02:33:45,879
What are you doing?

1301
02:33:45,879 --> 02:33:46,879
Hey.

1302
02:33:46,879 --> 02:33:47,879
Somebody keep track of my hands.

1303
02:33:47,879 --> 02:33:51,360
Get out of this.

1304
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:52,360
There's an extra one for you.

1305
02:33:52,360 --> 02:33:53,360
I don't know.

1306
02:33:53,360 --> 02:34:03,260
I'm not even going to link you on that one.

1307
02:34:03,260 --> 02:34:08,819
You'll find it somehow.

1308
02:34:08,819 --> 02:34:11,819
What I'm next is I think we've seen this is called Jerma and the Dark Guy.

1309
02:34:11,819 --> 02:34:21,010
I walk out the door and there's just the there's the dark guy and he's just lined up the shot

1310
02:34:21,010 --> 02:34:23,010
and you're like, OK, go ahead.

1311
02:34:23,010 --> 02:34:28,440
And he's just like, hold on.

1312
02:34:28,440 --> 02:34:32,440
By the way, this happens like two or three times a week.

1313
02:34:32,440 --> 02:34:37,440
After a year, you're going to like kick out of the dark.

1314
02:34:37,440 --> 02:34:38,440
Jesus Christ.

1315
02:34:38,440 --> 02:34:39,440
That was loud.

1316
02:34:39,440 --> 02:34:40,440
You're going to be like, don't fucking get.

1317
02:34:40,440 --> 02:34:41,440
Don't come in my house ever again.

1318
02:34:41,440 --> 02:34:45,299
He's going to look at you like, what?

1319
02:34:45,299 --> 02:34:46,299
Don't don't leave.

1320
02:34:46,299 --> 02:34:47,299
Don't ever come back.

1321
02:34:47,299 --> 02:34:49,299
Get the fuck out of my house.

1322
02:34:49,299 --> 02:34:52,299
And he'll just be like, well, this bag like his bag of fucking darts on his back.

1323
02:34:52,299 --> 02:34:53,299
OK.

1324
02:34:53,299 --> 02:34:54,610
Bye.

1325
02:34:54,610 --> 02:34:55,610
You'll never see me again.

1326
02:34:55,610 --> 02:34:58,610
And you're like, yeah, get the fuck out of here, dark asshole.

1327
02:34:58,610 --> 02:35:00,610
The door closes and he's gone.

1328
02:35:00,610 --> 02:35:06,610
By the way, two months later, a dart hits your like window and you look out, you're

1329
02:35:06,610 --> 02:35:07,610
like that motherfucker.

1330
02:35:07,610 --> 02:35:10,610
And he's just like.

1331
02:35:10,610 --> 02:35:12,610
And he fucking runs away.

1332
02:35:12,610 --> 02:35:17,469
What the hell was I talking about?

1333
02:35:17,469 --> 02:35:28,379
I don't know.

1334
02:35:28,379 --> 02:35:32,379
I can't I cannot tell you what that I can't bring anything out of that for you.

1335
02:35:32,379 --> 02:35:35,510
Just there was a guy that throws darts at you.

1336
02:35:35,510 --> 02:35:36,510
Just watch out.

1337
02:35:36,510 --> 02:35:37,510
Didn't get rid of him.

1338
02:35:37,510 --> 02:35:38,510
He's in your house.

1339
02:35:38,510 --> 02:35:43,649
I don't know why there's a guy throwing darts in your house or what that's alluding to.

1340
02:35:43,649 --> 02:35:44,649
But here's the link.

1341
02:35:44,649 --> 02:35:47,979
It was a metaphor for Cox.

1342
02:35:47,979 --> 02:35:48,979
Oh, I see.

1343
02:35:48,979 --> 02:35:49,979
OK.

1344
02:35:49,979 --> 02:35:52,049
That makes sense.

1345
02:35:52,049 --> 02:35:53,049
What does it?

1346
02:35:53,049 --> 02:35:55,059
Probably not.

1347
02:35:55,059 --> 02:35:56,489
All right, let's go.

1348
02:35:56,489 --> 02:36:03,489
This next one is, oh, we got a chair, chairs, bizarre adventure, golden stream streaming

1349
02:36:03,489 --> 02:36:05,239
gold.

1350
02:36:05,239 --> 02:36:08,239
I think this is like a season five opener or something.

1351
02:36:08,239 --> 02:36:11,239
This is like late season Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.

1352
02:36:11,239 --> 02:36:12,239
I think opening.

1353
02:36:12,239 --> 02:36:17,239
So if you've never just whatever, it's not what I don't at this point, I'm just going

1354
02:36:17,239 --> 02:36:18,239
to press play.

1355
02:36:18,239 --> 02:36:19,239
You know what's about to happen.

1356
02:36:19,239 --> 02:36:20,239
So do what you need to do.

1357
02:36:37,940 --> 02:36:38,940
One guy.

1358
02:36:39,940 --> 02:36:40,940
Looking out for you.

1359
02:36:40,940 --> 02:36:41,940
Really.

1360
02:36:51,659 --> 02:36:52,659
That fucking hat is so bad.

1361
02:36:55,659 --> 02:37:03,250
I've got to get in front of that square and get away from it.

1362
02:37:22,500 --> 02:37:24,059
One guy.

1363
02:37:53,379 --> 02:37:56,379
I don't usually when I see an image of myself, I know where it's from.

1364
02:37:56,379 --> 02:37:57,379
Sort of.

1365
02:37:57,379 --> 02:37:59,379
I don't know where that's from.

1366
02:37:59,379 --> 02:38:05,829
It was Jared Jared's Bizarre Adventure Golden Stream.

1367
02:38:05,829 --> 02:38:07,520
Here you go.

1368
02:38:07,520 --> 02:38:14,459
Why do you love watching yourself so much?

1369
02:38:14,459 --> 02:38:15,459
I don't.

1370
02:38:15,459 --> 02:38:21,459
I love watching other people create scenarios around things I've done.

1371
02:38:21,459 --> 02:38:23,950
It's fucking wonderful.

1372
02:38:23,950 --> 02:38:26,829
He's an egomaniac.

1373
02:38:26,829 --> 02:38:27,829
He's a narcissist.

1374
02:38:27,829 --> 02:38:30,200
Don't ever trust this guy.

1375
02:38:30,200 --> 02:38:31,200
Don't ever trust him.

1376
02:38:31,200 --> 02:38:37,709
All right, let's go.

1377
02:38:37,709 --> 02:38:39,709
This one's called the cool guy contest.

1378
02:38:39,709 --> 02:38:45,829
This is the cool guy contest.

1379
02:38:45,829 --> 02:38:55,649
Alien.

1380
02:38:55,649 --> 02:39:02,840
Contest.

1381
02:39:02,840 --> 02:39:14,360
Have you seen this?

1382
02:39:14,360 --> 02:39:17,360
One day, fast German alien were walking to get burgers.

1383
02:39:17,360 --> 02:39:38,889
What game is this taken from?

1384
02:39:38,889 --> 02:39:40,889
Cool guy.

1385
02:39:40,889 --> 02:39:43,149
That's insane.

1386
02:39:43,149 --> 02:39:44,149
Right there.

1387
02:39:44,149 --> 02:39:45,149
Can you see?

1388
02:39:45,149 --> 02:39:47,149
I can't even hear it.

1389
02:39:47,149 --> 02:39:48,149
Yeah.

1390
02:39:48,149 --> 02:39:49,149
Yeah.

1391
02:39:49,149 --> 02:39:50,149
Yes.

1392
02:39:50,149 --> 02:39:52,149
Yes.

1393
02:39:52,149 --> 02:39:53,899
That's it.

1394
02:39:53,899 --> 02:39:55,899
That's it.

1395
02:39:55,899 --> 02:40:00,510
Purple alien says he's going to win.

1396
02:40:00,510 --> 02:40:02,510
You got something to say?

1397
02:40:02,510 --> 02:40:04,750
Say it again.

1398
02:40:04,750 --> 02:40:05,750
I want to win.

1399
02:40:05,750 --> 02:40:06,750
I want to win.

1400
02:40:06,750 --> 02:40:07,750
I want to win.

1401
02:40:07,750 --> 02:40:11,250
He's gone.

1402
02:40:11,250 --> 02:40:14,620
Who do you think will win?

1403
02:40:14,620 --> 02:40:58,670
Enough fooling around.

1404
02:40:58,670 --> 02:41:00,670
The contest is starting.

1405
02:41:00,670 --> 02:41:08,379
Calculating.

1406
02:41:08,379 --> 02:41:09,379
Calculating.

1407
02:41:09,379 --> 02:41:10,379
Who the fuck are these two?

1408
02:41:10,379 --> 02:41:11,379
Calculating.

1409
02:41:11,379 --> 02:41:12,379
Calculating.

1410
02:41:12,379 --> 02:41:13,379
Fever.

1411
02:41:13,379 --> 02:41:16,860
Steve.

1412
02:41:16,860 --> 02:41:17,860
Fast German.

1413
02:41:17,860 --> 02:41:18,860
Purple alien.

1414
02:41:18,860 --> 02:41:19,860
Frosty.

1415
02:41:19,860 --> 02:41:25,270
Frosty wins the cool guy contest.

1416
02:41:25,270 --> 02:41:30,540
This is terrible.

1417
02:41:30,540 --> 02:41:34,469
Absolutely terrible.

1418
02:41:34,469 --> 02:41:37,469
It appears as though they have misunderstood the contest.

1419
02:41:37,469 --> 02:41:49,889
That was fucking wild.

1420
02:41:49,889 --> 02:41:53,979
That was a dream.

1421
02:41:53,979 --> 02:41:55,979
That was, that was perfect.

1422
02:41:55,979 --> 02:41:59,120
That should be a children's TV show.

1423
02:41:59,120 --> 02:42:03,049
Think about it.

1424
02:42:03,049 --> 02:42:04,049
Maybe.

1425
02:42:04,049 --> 02:42:06,540
We got a lot more to do.

1426
02:42:06,540 --> 02:42:08,909
You thought, yeah, this is a good indicator.

1427
02:42:08,909 --> 02:42:09,909
This is about three hours.

1428
02:42:09,909 --> 02:42:14,200
There's much more to see.

1429
02:42:14,200 --> 02:42:16,819
You guys have just absolutely knocked it out of the park.

1430
02:42:16,819 --> 02:42:20,450
That's why I want to do, I want to do the green screen again.

1431
02:42:21,450 --> 02:42:27,450
Because I feel like so much interesting shit comes out of these green screen videos.

1432
02:42:27,450 --> 02:42:30,750
And when we did the first one, it was like, oh, that was cool.

1433
02:42:30,750 --> 02:42:31,750
Do it again.

1434
02:42:31,750 --> 02:42:35,750
Yeah, I guess I was only going to do it that one time, but I guess we'll do it again.

1435
02:42:35,750 --> 02:42:38,750
And the encore happened recently and it was awesome.

1436
02:42:38,750 --> 02:42:41,750
And then people are still making these things.

1437
02:42:41,750 --> 02:42:50,190
So why not do like another seven hours in front of a green screen and put on more costumes and stuff and give you guys more material?

1438
02:42:50,190 --> 02:42:53,389
Just keep adding more material.

1439
02:42:53,389 --> 02:42:54,389
Maybe.

1440
02:42:54,389 --> 02:43:00,659
It seems like you guys have a lot of fun with this and they're really, really fun to watch on stream.

1441
02:43:00,659 --> 02:43:07,399
Maybe I'll get back in that studio and do it again.

1442
02:43:07,399 --> 02:43:09,399
Making an entire cinematic universe.

1443
02:43:09,399 --> 02:43:12,110
Yeah.

1444
02:43:12,110 --> 02:43:13,110
Something to think about.

1445
02:43:13,110 --> 02:43:15,569
But let's see.

1446
02:43:15,569 --> 02:43:16,569
Did I link that?

1447
02:43:16,569 --> 02:43:17,569
I did, I think.

1448
02:43:17,569 --> 02:43:18,569
Did I link it?

1449
02:43:18,569 --> 02:43:21,860
Just in case I didn't.

1450
02:43:21,860 --> 02:43:22,860
The JCU.

1451
02:43:22,860 --> 02:43:29,620
Just random clips of me puking, pretending to rip my pants and punching the air.

1452
02:43:29,620 --> 02:43:31,620
What a cinematic universe that is.

1453
02:43:31,620 --> 02:43:35,479
Let's go.

1454
02:43:35,479 --> 02:43:42,340
This is called Alex Jones spots a liberal.

1455
02:44:10,620 --> 02:44:11,620
What the fuck.

1456
02:44:12,930 --> 02:44:13,930
Here you go.

1457
02:44:14,930 --> 02:44:18,379
There it was.

1458
02:44:18,379 --> 02:44:19,379
Look at me.

1459
02:44:22,030 --> 02:44:24,489
Coming up next.

1460
02:44:24,489 --> 02:44:31,809
Next is Jerma Shortking. I'm going with that height theme on today's stream.

1461
02:44:31,809 --> 02:44:42,590
Shortking. Why does a scale say 5'1"? A scale does not tell you how tall you are, it tells

1462
02:44:42,590 --> 02:44:48,299
you how much you weigh. That's why it's called a scale.

1463
02:44:48,299 --> 02:44:53,540
I'm five foot something but my bills all pay. All my tippy toes from L.A. to the bay.

1464
02:44:53,540 --> 02:44:57,659
Going off the deep end, chill in the shallow. You don't need your heels girl, just bring

1465
02:44:58,260 --> 02:45:04,239
a towel. I'm five foot something and I'm royalty. Short King Mama A. I'm five foot something

1466
02:45:04,239 --> 02:45:11,239
and I'm royalty. Short King Mama A. They know my speed, it's all the ride. I'm a fun size

1467
02:45:11,239 --> 02:45:18,239
super nice guy. I'm five foot something and I'm royalty. Short King Mama A. Short A. I'm

1468
02:45:18,520 --> 02:45:27,139
five foot something. This is not a real picture. This is a real picture. That's a real picture.

1469
02:45:27,540 --> 02:45:36,399
Not a real picture. It was a real picture. Not a real picture. I'm not linking that one. That was

1470
02:45:36,399 --> 02:45:47,360
fun. I think that's 5,000 views. That's 5,000 views? How? Didn't, did you just, did you, you did,

1471
02:45:47,360 --> 02:45:58,159
how long has this video existed? Did you, was this like, submitted like today? Like 10, like a week

1472
02:45:58,159 --> 02:46:07,110
ago? That's like, that's pretty good for being live for, it's been a month, never mind. It was

1473
02:46:07,110 --> 02:46:16,840
uploaded a month ago, a month and a half ago. Optimization. That's not gonna have a million

1474
02:46:16,840 --> 02:46:48,899
views in a couple months. This is called Top Streamer. What did it say?

1475
02:46:56,290 --> 02:47:05,620
Jeremy eats ass? Tonight, Jeremy eat ass. And then the snort. I feel like this is what a lot of

1476
02:47:05,620 --> 02:47:12,579
people use for their I'm starting stream soon stuff. Like I'm going live. Here we go. Stream

1477
02:47:12,579 --> 02:47:32,340
starting soon. And then it like loops like four or five times. Tonight, Jeremy eats ass.

1478
02:47:36,180 --> 02:47:50,520
That fucking snort. Seriously. You do something on camera that you just, the second that you do it,

1479
02:47:50,520 --> 02:48:14,149
you know, uh, here's the link. Uh, this one's called, this streamer is bleeped. This streamer is

02:48:14,149 --> 02:48:42,440
fucked. It's bleeped though. Here we go. Oh, you motherfucker. You motherfucker.

1481
02:49:09,670 --> 02:49:46,770
It's a lot of editing. Oh, this is the best part. The plus like, if you enjoyed the video with the

1482
02:49:46,770 --> 02:49:54,850
smiley face. Where is it? Where is the press like if you liked the video?

1483
02:49:57,000 --> 02:50:08,290
That's authentic. That's authentic old YouTuber. Where is it?

1484
02:50:12,209 --> 02:50:19,250
There it is. Plus like, if you enjoy the video. Oh, right. Like video, right?

1485
02:50:19,569 --> 02:50:33,079
That's on my first like 150 videos. This is crazy. All right. Let's get you linked to this one too.

1486
02:50:33,079 --> 02:50:52,159
Get away from that one now. Uh, this is called Jerma tells chat how to puke on a ride. Source

1487
02:50:52,159 --> 02:51:01,190
filmmaker. Okay. Let's hear it. Guys, if you're going to throw up on a ride, don't be the dick.

1488
02:51:01,190 --> 02:51:05,590
Like you're throwing up, right? So try to do just, you're going to, your day is going to be fucked

1489
02:51:06,549 --> 02:51:12,950
up after that. Anyways, grab your shirt, lift it up, tilt it. So it makes a big cup and just

1490
02:51:12,950 --> 02:51:23,379
puke into your shirt down. Don't ruin somebody else's vacation. Just, yeah, just underwear.

1491
02:51:24,579 --> 02:51:31,139
It's true. Just imagine seeing somebody go, oh no, like pulling their pants and just

1492
02:51:31,139 --> 02:51:37,409
puke. That would be the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life.

1493
02:51:38,450 --> 02:51:44,209
I would never get over it. Ever. That would be the only thing I could think of for the rest of my life.

1494
02:51:48,680 --> 02:51:53,479
I'm okay. I'm thinking right now as if I've seen this, I've never seen this, but I'm laughing

1495
02:51:53,479 --> 02:52:00,930
because of it. Now I'm laughing after that. This didn't happen. Guys, but it's true though.

1496
02:52:01,729 --> 02:52:07,729
That you see, if you puke forward, if you are on a roller coaster and you puke forward,

1497
02:52:07,729 --> 02:52:14,209
it's going to spray and hit everybody. Not just one person's vacation. How many people can go on

1498
02:52:14,209 --> 02:52:21,879
a ride on a roller coaster or a spinning ride? I don't know, like 25. You have, he's doing it again.

1499
02:52:22,600 --> 02:52:28,760
I'm doing it again. Did I do this already? If you're going to throw up on a ride, but if you

1500
02:52:28,760 --> 02:52:36,920
throw up on a ride, there's 25 different people. You don't want to fuck up somebody else's vacation,

1501
02:52:36,920 --> 02:52:41,639
especially you have to throw up into your shirt. There's a big cup that you can make and you can

1502
02:52:41,639 --> 02:52:54,180
puke into your shirt. Don't ruin somebody else's vacation. Don't be the dick that you are throwing

1503
02:52:54,180 --> 02:53:04,659
up. So grab your shirt, lift it up, tilt it so it makes a big cup, and then just puke into your

1504
02:53:04,659 --> 02:53:13,969
shirt. Down. Don't ruin somebody else's vacation. Just puke into your underwear.

1505
02:53:18,209 --> 02:53:32,770
Did I get it? That's really fucking good though. Nice work. He's got the same shirt on. I tell

1506
02:53:32,770 --> 02:53:36,850
you, I wear the same clothes every fucking day. Well, not the same ones, the same types of clothing.

1507
02:53:36,850 --> 02:53:49,399
Blue. Black pants. Navy sneakers. Black shirt. Jeans. Sneakers. Black socks. Shoes. I don't know.

1508
02:53:49,399 --> 02:54:24,899
Every day I wear clothes. This is called German 985 egg. YTPMV? YTPMV. Oh, it's the egg. Of course

1509
02:54:24,899 --> 02:54:57,010
it is. We all love eggs. I was trying to be healthy. What song is this? Wait. This is from Donkey Kong.

1510
02:55:00,879 --> 02:55:34,389
The egg. I can't take it anymore. I cracked an egg in his mouth. What's German walk? Yeah,

1511
02:55:34,389 --> 02:55:39,860
I like cracked an egg in his mouth and it like revived him. 2012 YouTube was weird.

1512
02:55:39,860 --> 02:56:29,219
What the fuck is happening? Was I making these noises? I don't remember doing that.

1513
02:56:38,719 --> 02:56:59,750
Loud. This is gonna be loud. Very loud. Play it. I don't want it to be loud. I made it like

1514
02:56:59,750 --> 02:57:07,059
lower the volume. Look at that Kramer. Look at that Kramer. That's a perfect Kramer impression

1515
02:57:07,059 --> 02:57:41,729
right there. This isn't even part of the playlist. Why is it so laggy? I'm not, I'm not pausing it.

1516
02:57:45,940 --> 02:57:57,639
No, we're not just gonna play other videos. I paused it once. All right, I'm unpaused. My hands

1517
02:57:57,639 --> 02:58:30,639
are in the air. I'll prove it. Just want to make sure. All right, there you go. That's not me doing

1518
02:58:30,639 --> 02:58:41,219
that. I paused. We've seen the video five times. All right, let's go. This is called We Got Him. We

1519
02:58:41,219 --> 02:58:45,840
Got Him. I'll let you, I won't move. It'll hit me right in the face. It'll hit me directly in the face.

1520
02:58:46,799 --> 02:58:54,819
I don't care. Do it. You want to make that joke so bad.

1521
02:59:03,510 --> 02:59:18,709
Nice job. Nice work. Take a look at that hat. This hat is not made out of a hat material.

1522
02:59:18,709 --> 02:59:26,709
Same thing with this vest. Direct hit him. It's a critical hit. Yeah, that's a crit.

1523
02:59:27,430 --> 02:59:38,760
Surprised I was still standing after that one. That's We Got Him. The hat's made out of skin.

1524
02:59:45,700 --> 02:59:54,479
Okay, here we go. Coming up next is Jerma Scream Simulator. This, this video,

1525
02:59:54,479 --> 03:00:01,909
I'm looking at it now, is two hours long. It's a two fucking hour long video. Well, we're not gonna,

1526
03:00:01,909 --> 03:00:09,860
we're not gonna watch the full two hours of this. This person made the, okay, so the context here

1527
03:00:09,860 --> 03:00:14,659
is, remember when I talked about if you were just screaming, you turned on a live stream and it was

1528
03:00:14,659 --> 03:00:22,559
just you screaming the full blast for like three or four hours and you just looped it and put it

1529
03:00:22,559 --> 03:00:27,139
and made it, you didn't have a start, you didn't have an end, it just started and ended. This

1530
03:00:27,139 --> 03:01:49,489
person did it. This is my me yelling. Why did I think it was gonna be different? Faster. Faster.

1531
03:01:49,489 --> 03:02:42,280
That didn't do anything. Slower. This is an electric razor. Adventure MF Dan just gave five

1532
03:02:44,469 --> 03:02:50,309
subs. I'm not laughing at that. I'm laughing at what somebody said. Don't laugh for two minutes.

1533
03:02:50,309 --> 03:03:04,260
We're not doing that shit again. I can't, I'm not gonna sit here and do that again. No, no, no, no.

1534
03:03:06,180 --> 03:03:13,520
What have I done? What's going on? Why is this about an hour and 42 minutes?

1535
03:03:16,159 --> 03:03:23,430
It's up and...

1536
03:03:48,069 --> 03:03:51,989
This is just a drunk guy. This is a drunk guy at a party like,

1537
03:03:51,989 --> 03:03:55,350
don't look at how much better I look with my glasses up.

1538
03:03:55,350 --> 03:03:57,510
Do you think I look better with them up or down?

1539
03:04:00,180 --> 03:04:18,079
Yeah, like I got glasses, but I don't need them. I'm gonna put them up there

1540
03:04:18,959 --> 03:04:23,680
just in case you need to read something.

1541
03:04:27,360 --> 03:04:40,000
What's that? Like your number and then...

1542
03:04:40,399 --> 03:05:09,030
Okay, we're gonna keep going. Oh god, my stomach. Now fix the speed.

1543
03:05:15,959 --> 03:05:19,159
This is a different guard. So, um, hey, I'm a fucking secret agent.

1544
03:05:22,360 --> 03:05:26,290
What about up here? Look at how much more attractive I am when they're up there.

1545
03:05:30,229 --> 03:05:34,629
Now this is, you're on drugs. You're not, now you're not drinking. You're just on drugs.

1546
03:05:34,629 --> 03:05:37,670
Something, what, something very quick. Something very too much.

1547
03:05:37,670 --> 03:05:41,700
What about up here? Look at how much more attractive I am when they're up there.

1548
03:05:42,340 --> 03:05:45,760
Yeah, like I got glasses, but I don't really need them. I'm just gonna put them up there

1549
03:05:45,760 --> 03:05:48,479
just in case you need to read something. Like your number.

1550
03:05:48,479 --> 03:05:55,750
All right, I'm fucking out of here. That was fucked.

1551
03:05:55,750 --> 03:06:01,829
This next one's called Germ of the Acrobat. Germ of the Acrobat.

1552
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:05,879
And we're gonna put this back to, uh, to normal, which it is. Good.

1553
03:06:06,520 --> 03:06:11,040
Not a big deal.

1554
03:06:45,889 --> 03:06:50,309
I just want to hear that. Do you eat ass? Yes.

1555
03:06:50,309 --> 03:06:52,309
Not a big deal.

1556
03:07:06,520 --> 03:07:20,850
Deep fake. They're everywhere now. You can't escape them. I said no, by the way.

1557
03:07:20,850 --> 03:07:28,069
Okay, moving on. This one's called, uh, it's a trailer. Murder on Main Street.

1558
03:07:28,709 --> 03:07:41,540
I guess this was a movie. Was it? Wait, hold on. Was this a movie? It is now.

1559
03:07:45,459 --> 03:07:50,469
No. There's your tree. Merry Christmas. There it is.

1560
03:07:51,959 --> 03:08:01,809
Get bent. Speaking of getting bent, I got a two by four here. Why don't we have a little fun, huh?

1561
03:08:02,850 --> 03:08:06,870
Santa! With a fucking two by four? Is that what you want to see?

1562
03:08:07,909 --> 03:08:12,309
So hey, Merry fucking Christmas, everybody. Fuck out of here, Santa!

1563
03:08:13,270 --> 03:08:14,979
We went to Black Sea.

1564
03:08:17,379 --> 03:08:23,940
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a breaking story tonight. The UN implanted the were in Santa,

1565
03:08:23,940 --> 03:08:31,299
and is he still alive chip back in the late 80s? This is terrible, truly terrible. I hope they

1566
03:08:31,299 --> 03:08:39,569
throw the book at whoever it was that did this. The crime you see now, it's hard to even take.

1567
03:08:39,569 --> 03:08:48,600
Spoilers for a movie. It's major. It's not that I'm afraid of it. I always knew you had to be

1568
03:08:48,600 --> 03:08:56,120
willing to die to even do this job, but I don't want to push my- Spoilers for the noooo country

1569
03:08:56,120 --> 03:09:09,219
for old men. Chips forward and go out and meet something I don't understand. He'll have to put

1570
03:09:09,219 --> 03:09:30,000
his soul at hazard. Did you have to say okay? No country for old lambs. Because I killed Santa.

1571
03:09:30,879 --> 03:09:36,079
To count one and two. I look like Jerry Garcia.

1572
03:09:38,399 --> 03:09:44,399
What's the number one thing people do? The real court? Punch him, punch him, punch Santa.

1573
03:09:45,840 --> 03:09:52,399
What are these movies? How many movies do you have? I didn't do that. That was peaceful.

1574
03:09:53,040 --> 03:09:58,420
What is it?

1575
03:10:06,979 --> 03:10:13,729
Which would be worse? To live is a monster. To die is a good man.

1576
03:10:18,399 --> 03:10:19,360
There's a bunch of movies.

1577
03:10:24,180 --> 03:10:33,719
There was a spoiler for like 10 movies. Don't watch it. That was Murder on Main Street.

1578
03:10:49,959 --> 03:10:56,520
Vaught is now in pieces. No, you can watch. Can you not watch trailers on Twitch? Spoiler

as of October 2019 this still has yet to happen

1604
03:16:18,440 --> 03:16:22,479
furthermore your client has known history of making promises he can't keep

1605
03:16:22,479 --> 03:16:30,620
and lying about them when pressed face it right

1606
03:16:30,620 --> 03:16:34,659
German lied about Minecraft VR German lied about Taco Bell German lied about

03:16:40,899 --> 03:16:52,000
German is an honest man with polygraph take a look at this your honor what is

1609
03:16:52,079 --> 03:16:59,680

can say he's the most transparent streamer on switch that wasn't even a

1612
03:17:15,430 --> 03:17:19,829
real doctor he was clearly a hired actor doesn't matter if the doctor was an

1613
03:17:19,829 --> 03:17:24,440
actor the polygraph machine was real the polygraph machine was a cheap laptop

1614
03:17:24,440 --> 03:17:41,340
from the right of the stuff in Best Buy one month in the electric

1615
03:17:41,340 --> 03:17:58,700
one full month guilty guilty here's the thing though I wasn't asked about ace

1616
03:17:58,700 --> 03:18:01,459
attorney on the polygraph so the polygraph would not be admissible in

1617
03:18:01,459 --> 03:18:07,500
court if you want to know if I eat ass or not maybe you could bring that to

1642
03:21:53,879 --> 03:21:56,190

03:22:04,190 --> 03:22:06,190
with a pitch of the runners

1647
03:22:06,190 --> 03:22:08,190

1659
03:22:36,680 --> 03:22:41,739

1691
03:24:19,739 --> 03:24:21,739

1698
03:24:34,299 --> 03:24:38,010
so here we go

1699
03:24:38,010 --> 03:24:40,010

1700
03:24:40,010 --> 03:24:42,010

1705
03:24:50,319 --> 03:24:52,319

1707
03:24:54,319 --> 03:24:56,319

1708
03:24:56,319 --> 03:24:58,319
to prove how much I love wine

1709
03:24:58,319 --> 03:25:00,319
and now what am I supposed to do

1710
03:25:00,319 --> 03:25:02,319
throw it in the trash

1711
03:25:02,319 --> 03:25:05,899

1712
03:25:05,899 --> 03:25:07,899

03:25:07,899 --> 03:25:09,899

03:25:11,899 --> 03:25:13,899
by two hours

1716
03:25:13,899 --> 03:25:15,899
and I bought this special red wine suit

03:25:15,899 --> 03:25:17,899
to prove how much I love wine

1718
03:25:17,899 --> 03:25:19,899

03:25:19,899 --> 03:25:21,899
throw it in the trash

1720
03:25:21,899 --> 03:25:26,250

1726
03:25:36,729 --> 03:25:39,159

1728
03:25:41,159 --> 03:25:44,280
so

1729
03:25:44,280 --> 03:25:46,280
google the gareth makes great fucking animations

1730
03:25:46,280 --> 03:25:50,190

1731
03:25:50,190 --> 03:25:52,190

1732
03:25:52,190 --> 03:25:54,190
I don't know, it's going to be a surprise for all of us

1733
03:25:54,190 --> 03:25:58,139
because I have no idea

1734
03:26:14,219 --> 03:26:16,219

03:26:27,799 --> 03:26:29,799

1736
03:26:29,799 --> 03:26:31,799
the best part about this

1737
03:26:31,799 --> 03:26:42,879
is sincerely

1738
03:26:42,879 --> 03:26:45,049
that's like a whole tv show

1739
03:26:45,049 --> 03:26:48,059
but

1740
03:26:48,059 --> 03:26:50,059
those clips are taken over the course of like

1741
03:26:50,059 --> 03:26:53,000
four hours

1742
03:26:53,000 --> 03:26:55,000
looks like you got cancelled after one episode

1743
03:26:55,000 --> 03:27:00,000
like a real tv show

1744
03:27:00,000 --> 03:27:05,440

1755
03:27:52,940 --> 03:27:56,010

1815
03:30:45,819 --> 03:30:48,559
oh alright let's get to

1816
03:30:48,559 --> 03:30:50,559
the songs there are a few things here let's put the

1817
03:30:50,559 --> 03:30:52,989
camera back on let's get

1818
03:30:52,989 --> 03:30:54,989
this in a spot where

1819
03:30:54,989 --> 03:30:59,020
it needs to be so that

1820
03:30:59,020 --> 03:31:01,020
was kind of it in a way

1821
03:31:01,020 --> 03:31:04,159
I thought I knew it was going to take

1822
03:31:04,159 --> 03:31:06,159
somewhere from like three to four hours

1823
03:31:06,159 --> 03:31:08,159
that's kind of what I was planning

1824
03:31:08,159 --> 03:31:10,159
the length of this one oh yeah I did it earlier

1825
03:31:10,159 --> 03:31:12,159
but gotta do it again

1826
03:31:12,159 --> 03:31:14,159
this is just fucking this is art right now

1827
03:31:14,159 --> 03:31:16,399
so you could

1828
03:31:16,399 --> 03:31:18,399
judging by how long this took

1829
03:31:18,399 --> 03:31:20,700
you can expect them to all

1830
03:31:20,700 --> 03:31:22,700
sort of be this sort of similar length like a three to four

1831
03:31:22,700 --> 03:31:24,700
probably this would be about four hours

1832
03:31:24,700 --> 03:31:28,920
I would assume

1833
03:31:28,920 --> 03:31:30,920
this I could make the camera bigger

1834
03:31:30,920 --> 03:31:32,920
and we'll listen to this couple of music

1835
03:31:32,920 --> 03:31:38,430
tracks to listen to

1836
03:31:38,430 --> 03:31:40,729
don't fucking do that

1837
03:31:40,729 --> 03:31:45,840

1843
03:32:01,979 --> 03:32:05,309

1844
03:32:05,309 --> 03:32:08,379

03:33:39,020 --> 03:34:13,899
okay we're ready

1866
03:34:13,899 --> 03:34:34,809
didn't make this

1867
03:34:34,809 --> 03:34:37,440
that's pretty good

1868
03:34:37,440 --> 03:34:39,440
what's my soundcloud I don't have one

1869
03:34:39,440 --> 03:34:41,440
I just listen to other talented soundcloud artists

1870
03:34:41,440 --> 03:34:44,700
and go like this

1871
03:34:44,700 --> 03:35:06,780
nice

1872
03:35:06,780 --> 03:35:09,149
you should do one

1873
03:35:09,149 --> 03:35:11,579
that was pretty good

1874
03:35:11,579 --> 03:35:15,600
that was a nice beat

1875
03:35:15,600 --> 03:35:18,159
no emotion for two minutes

1876
03:35:18,159 --> 03:35:20,159
we did that yesterday

1877
03:35:20,159 --> 03:35:22,159
and I lost fucking 1500 viewers

1878
03:35:22,159 --> 03:35:24,780
those people are never coming back

1879
03:35:24,780 --> 03:35:29,770
alright that's the end of that

1880
03:35:29,770 --> 03:35:33,159
I have zero viewers now

1881
03:35:33,159 --> 03:35:35,530
shit

1882
03:35:35,530 --> 03:35:42,379
I don't want to be here anymore

1883
03:35:42,379 --> 03:35:45,899
but before we move on

1884
03:35:45,899 --> 03:35:49,229
I'm going to just hang up for a little bit

1885
03:35:49,229 --> 03:35:51,719
I want to tell you

1886
03:35:51,719 --> 03:35:54,969
that thank you

1887
03:35:54,969 --> 03:35:56,969
first of all for everybody that submitted everything

1888
03:35:56,969 --> 03:35:59,209
you guys are immensely talented

1889
03:35:59,209 --> 03:36:01,209
I am shocked every day

1890
03:36:01,209 --> 03:36:03,209
when new videos new artwork everything comes in

1891
03:36:03,209 --> 03:36:05,450
and this was number one

1892
03:36:05,450 --> 03:36:07,450
so I think

1893
03:36:07,450 --> 03:36:09,450
I think it was a success I think this is a cool idea

1894
03:36:09,450 --> 03:36:11,450
I think this is a better idea

1895
03:36:11,450 --> 03:36:13,760
than just showing this stuff

1896
03:36:13,760 --> 03:36:15,760
at the very end of a livestream

1897
03:36:15,760 --> 03:36:18,000
when the wind down happens

1898
03:36:18,000 --> 03:36:22,030
I think this is a much better idea

1899
03:36:22,030 --> 03:36:24,030
tons of great videos tons of great artwork

1900
03:36:24,030 --> 03:36:26,030
my body hurts from laughing at a few of those

1901
03:36:26,030 --> 03:36:28,649
and I'm in awe

1902
03:36:28,649 --> 03:36:30,649
at the sheer amount of talent some of you artists

1903
03:36:30,649 --> 03:36:32,649
can put forth onto a piece of paper

1904
03:36:32,649 --> 03:36:34,889
it's fucking incredible

1905
03:36:34,889 --> 03:36:36,889
so the next community

1906
03:36:36,889 --> 03:36:38,889
content night

1907
03:36:38,889 --> 03:36:40,889
is probably going to be

1908
03:36:40,889 --> 03:36:45,100
whenever there is about

1909
03:36:45,100 --> 03:36:47,100
fourish hours of content

1910
03:36:47,100 --> 03:36:49,790
I think that's a good

1911
03:36:49,790 --> 03:36:51,790
clean community night

1912
03:36:51,790 --> 03:36:55,360
so it's

1913
03:36:55,360 --> 03:36:57,360
when I announced that channel

1914
03:36:57,360 --> 03:37:00,170
about what like a month ago

1915
03:37:00,170 --> 03:37:02,170
that was like just about what thirty

1916
03:37:02,170 --> 03:37:06,200
thirty five days ago something like that

1917
03:37:06,200 --> 03:37:08,200
I would say probably like once every once a month

1918
03:37:08,200 --> 03:37:10,200
it'll probably happen and if there's not enough

1919
03:37:10,200 --> 03:37:12,200
for like to fill because I see how many tabs

1920
03:37:12,200 --> 03:37:14,200
here I'm going to see I'm going to count

1921
03:37:14,200 --> 03:37:16,200
how many videos there were how many pictures there were

1922
03:37:16,200 --> 03:37:19,850
to see how long it took to go through it

1923
03:37:19,850 --> 03:37:22,159
so you'll see

1924
03:37:22,159 --> 03:37:24,159
hopefully once a month if not that then every other month

1925
03:37:24,159 --> 03:37:28,569
we'll do like a just a night like this

1926
03:37:28,569 --> 03:37:31,319
so should be good

1927
03:37:31,319 --> 03:37:34,329
after this stream it'll be full in a week

1928
03:37:34,329 --> 03:37:36,329
then we'll have plenty of stuff to go

1929
03:37:36,329 --> 03:37:38,959
through so that should be good

1930
03:37:38,959 --> 03:37:41,959
who are you talking to we're not real

1931
03:37:41,959 --> 03:37:43,959
zero so wait what is going on

1932
03:37:43,959 --> 03:37:46,270
what is going on with twitch right now if I go

1933
03:37:46,270 --> 03:37:48,270
to twitch.tv does nobody have any viewers

1934
03:37:48,270 --> 03:37:50,270
is it zero viewers across the whole website

1935
03:37:50,270 --> 03:37:55,879
or is it just me everybody

1936
03:37:55,879 --> 03:37:59,209
uh oh uh oh

1937
03:37:59,209 --> 03:38:01,209
everybody has zero

1938
03:38:01,209 --> 03:38:03,520
viewers it's all been a lie

1939
03:38:03,520 --> 03:38:05,520
from the very beginning

1940
03:38:05,520 --> 03:38:09,420
it's all it's been a sham you're all

1941
03:38:09,420 --> 03:38:14,219

I knew it no I think that's um

1945
03:38:27,930 --> 03:38:30,170
I think that's a good cap

1946
03:38:30,170 --> 03:38:32,989
I think that's a good cap for the night

1947
03:38:32,989 --> 03:38:36,059
I could what time is it five thirty

1948
03:38:36,059 --> 03:38:38,059
four hours yeah

1949
03:38:38,059 --> 03:38:42,219
I think that's a good cap for the night

1950
03:38:42,219 --> 03:38:46,760
so I will see you guys I'm trying

1951
03:38:46,760 --> 03:38:54,889

03:43:27,770 --> 03:43:29,770
and this whole community have helped me get a more

2047
03:43:29,770 --> 03:43:32,399
positive outlook on life

2048
03:43:32,399 --> 03:43:36,239
and I can never thank you all enough it's really

2049
03:43:36,239 --> 03:43:40,590
great to hear stuff like this is

2050
03:43:40,590 --> 03:43:43,399
just it's why I wanted to do more of these

2051
03:43:43,399 --> 03:43:47,120
types of things it's fun to collectively

2052
03:43:47,120 --> 03:43:49,930
come together and look

2053
03:43:49,930 --> 03:43:53,709
at stuff feels pretty good

2054
03:43:53,709 --> 03:43:57,290
I also love iPods

2055
03:43:57,290 --> 03:44:04,000
thank you though

2056
03:44:04,000 --> 03:44:06,000
I can't see the top donators yeah I know something

2057
03:44:06,000 --> 03:44:08,680
I don't know why

2058
03:44:08,680 --> 03:44:10,680
that's here but it is

2059
03:44:10,680 --> 03:44:13,229
I need to like

2060
03:44:13,229 --> 03:44:15,229
Streamlabs OBS has this

2061
03:44:15,229 --> 03:44:17,229
thing where it says

2062
03:44:17,229 --> 03:44:19,229
the sessions right

2063
03:44:19,229 --> 03:44:21,659
so I have for a source

2064
03:44:21,659 --> 03:44:23,659
it's the sessions top

2065
03:44:23,659 --> 03:44:25,659
subgifter doesn't that mean the stream

2066
03:44:25,659 --> 03:44:28,409
session so why does this

2067
03:44:28,409 --> 03:44:30,409
not work half the time

2068
03:44:30,409 --> 03:44:35,920
it doesn't make any sense is it not

2069
03:44:35,920 --> 03:44:37,920
pulling it from Twitch's end somehow but it's

2070
03:44:37,920 --> 03:44:42,329
a Streamlabs thing I don't know

2071
03:44:42,329 --> 03:44:46,170
maybe it's from the stuff from today

2072
03:44:46,170 --> 03:44:48,170
but it didn't work a few days ago either

2073
03:44:48,170 --> 03:44:50,600
Twitch has had zero viewers right now

2074
03:44:50,600 --> 03:44:52,600
somebody's panicking in that office

2075
03:44:52,600 --> 03:44:54,600
at the Twitch office

2076
03:44:54,600 --> 03:44:58,379
papers are flying around probably

2077
03:44:58,379 --> 03:45:00,379
like three people got fired

2078
03:45:00,379 --> 03:45:02,379
or something it's just like who did it

2079
03:45:02,379 --> 03:45:13,069
the alarms are going off

2080
03:45:13,069 --> 03:45:16,590
zero views

2081
03:45:16,590 --> 03:45:21,639
but thank you iPod Matt appreciate it

2082
03:45:21,639 --> 03:45:24,969

Germa I tell you the exact amount

2085
03:45:28,969 --> 03:45:30,969
but I skipped Algebra 2 episode 4

2086
03:45:30,969 --> 03:45:32,969
I thought it was a clip show

2087
03:45:37,760 --> 03:45:39,760
Algebra 2 episode 4

2088
03:45:39,760 --> 03:45:41,760

this is basically Jex I said I was going to watch it later

2098
03:46:09,200 --> 03:46:13,100
so that's what we're going to do

2099
03:46:13,100 --> 03:46:25,260
maybe get it on screen

2100
03:46:25,260 --> 03:46:32,729
hi guys I thought it was

2101
03:46:32,729 --> 03:46:35,739
going to be a web browser

2102
03:46:35,739 --> 03:46:38,940
turns out it's not it's just me

2103
03:46:38,940 --> 03:46:40,940
and my fucking just candid

2104
03:46:40,940 --> 03:46:46,639
face

2105
03:46:46,639 --> 03:46:48,639
now you should see something on the screen

2106
03:46:48,639 --> 03:46:54,520
this is basically Jex

2107
03:47:02,520 --> 03:47:04,520
this is real this is dumped

2108
03:47:41,579 --> 03:47:43,579

2110
03:47:47,930 --> 03:47:50,299
John Travolta

2111
03:47:50,299 --> 03:47:52,299

03:48:07,549 --> 03:48:12,719

03:50:00,120 --> 03:50:02,120
glad you liked my Garf

03:50:02,120 --> 03:50:04,120
my Garf collage collage

2157
03:50:04,120 --> 03:50:06,120
Jerma even if Garf doesn't do

2158
03:50:06,120 --> 03:50:08,120
Garfographs anymore you can count on

2159
03:50:08,120 --> 03:50:10,120
fun Garf content every community night stream

2160
03:50:10,120 --> 03:50:12,120
I still gotta hook you

2161
03:50:12,120 --> 03:50:14,120
in to join my new animated

2162
03:50:14,120 --> 03:50:16,120
movie you said you might

2163
03:50:16,120 --> 03:50:18,120
join I know just how the

2164
03:50:18,120 --> 03:50:20,120
scales I couldn't get it done for this stream but next

2165
03:50:20,120 --> 03:50:22,120
time you'll get an exclusive trailer and a real Garfield

2166
03:50:22,120 --> 03:50:24,680
face reveal don't

2167
03:50:24,680 --> 03:50:30,760
I already know what Garfield's face looks like

2168
03:50:30,760 --> 03:50:36,329
he's everywhere how's that for a Garfograph

2169
03:50:36,329 --> 03:50:38,329
can you tell Garfield the next community night stream

2170
03:50:38,329 --> 03:50:40,329
is so I have the trailer ready

2171
03:50:40,329 --> 03:50:42,329
probably I would say somewhere between 30

2172
03:50:42,329 --> 03:50:44,329
and 40 days from right now once a month

2173
03:50:44,329 --> 03:50:50,280
here's the thing with projects

2174
03:50:50,280 --> 03:50:52,590
I am currently

2175
03:50:52,590 --> 03:50:54,829
working on

2176
03:50:54,829 --> 03:50:56,829
2 at the moment right now

2177
03:50:56,829 --> 03:50:59,579
remember I told you guys before the carnival happened

2178
03:50:59,579 --> 03:51:02,520
that

2179
03:51:02,520 --> 03:51:04,520
there were going to be more of those

2180
03:51:04,520 --> 03:51:08,940
very very quickly so you can

2181
03:51:08,940 --> 03:51:10,940
expect that

2182
03:51:10,940 --> 03:51:13,440
every couple months every 2 or 3

2183
03:51:13,440 --> 03:51:15,440
months there's going to be something like

2184
03:51:15,440 --> 03:51:18,250
that on this channel not

2185
03:51:18,250 --> 03:51:20,250
carnivals just bigger

2186
03:51:20,250 --> 03:51:22,250
streams that I want to plan and

2187
03:51:22,250 --> 03:51:26,090
spend a lot of time on 2 of them

2188
03:51:26,090 --> 03:51:28,090
are already being worked on right now

2189
03:51:28,090 --> 03:51:30,090
one very much in particular is already

2190
03:51:30,090 --> 03:51:32,090
in the pre-planning stages

2191
03:51:32,090 --> 03:51:34,090
and is hopefully about 2 months away

2192
03:51:34,090 --> 03:51:38,760
maybe a little bit more depending on time

2193
03:51:38,760 --> 03:51:49,450
potentially really

2194
03:51:49,450 --> 03:51:51,450
exciting stuff in the future

2195
03:51:51,450 --> 03:51:54,010
we'll see

2196
03:51:54,010 --> 03:51:59,129
I'm just keeping my mind open

2197
03:51:59,129 --> 03:52:01,440
but look for the next community night

2198
03:52:01,440 --> 03:52:03,440
somewhere in November

2199
03:52:03,440 --> 03:52:05,440
like the first week of November maybe

2200
03:52:05,440 --> 03:52:09,319
something like that

2201
03:52:09,319 --> 03:52:13,360

03:53:24,639 --> 03:53:30,250
you're going to do just fine

2229
03:53:30,250 --> 03:53:33,450
good luck whatever it is hope you get it

2230
03:53:33,450 --> 03:53:40,350
you don't got to be nervous

2231
03:53:40,350 --> 03:53:42,350
remember this is something that you want

2232
03:53:42,350 --> 03:53:44,350
this is something you want to do

2233
03:53:44,350 --> 03:53:52,079
so grab it good luck though

2234
03:53:52,079 --> 03:53:54,079
I want to get a goose cab for the 250 bits

2235
03:53:54,079 --> 03:53:56,079
hey Jeremy I'm so glad you like my two home run videos

2236
03:53:56,079 --> 03:53:58,079
so much

2237
03:53:58,079 --> 03:54:00,079
I didn't even expect you to show the Ortiz Grand Slam again

2238
03:54:00,079 --> 03:54:02,079
but I'm glad you did

2239
03:54:02,079 --> 03:54:04,079
thanks for showing my content on stream

2240
03:54:04,079 --> 03:54:06,569
and I hope you continue streaming for a long time

2241
03:54:06,569 --> 03:54:08,569
they were great

2242
03:54:08,569 --> 03:54:10,809
they were fucking hilarious

2243
03:54:10,809 --> 03:54:13,629
absolutely

2244
03:54:13,629 --> 03:54:15,629
something about just super imposed on top of

2245
03:54:15,629 --> 03:54:17,629
Red Sox World Series wins

2246
03:54:17,629 --> 03:54:19,629
and playoff victories

2247
03:54:19,629 --> 03:54:21,870
it's just hilarious to me

2248
03:54:21,870 --> 03:54:25,389
so thank you

2249
03:54:25,389 --> 03:54:30,190
my pleasure

2250
03:54:30,190 --> 03:54:32,190
thank you for the 500 bits

2251
03:54:32,190 --> 03:54:34,190
you didn't read the short story I submitted for the community night

2252
03:54:34,190 --> 03:54:36,809
short story

2253
03:54:36,809 --> 03:54:43,469
short story

2254
03:54:43,469 --> 03:54:53,069
because I was just pulling images out of here

2255
03:54:53,069 --> 03:54:55,069
was there text in here?

2256
03:54:55,069 --> 03:55:19,709
oh there is like there is something right here

2257
03:55:19,709 --> 03:55:27,000
let's have text to speech read this right now

2258
03:55:27,000 --> 03:55:38,079
join the discord if you're not

2259
03:55:38,079 --> 03:55:50,750
that's how you can submit things

2260
03:55:50,750 --> 03:55:56,040
this is a short story

2261
03:55:56,040 --> 03:56:00,010
I believe this is

2262
03:56:00,010 --> 03:56:02,010
this looks like an

2263
03:56:02,010 --> 03:56:04,010
oh this is a spoiler I don't want to read that

2264
03:56:04,010 --> 03:56:08,489
alright let's see

2265
03:56:08,489 --> 03:56:12,520
I'll turn the music off for this one

2266
03:56:12,520 --> 03:56:14,520
hold on this is going to be faster

2267
03:56:14,520 --> 03:56:19,959
that's good right there

2268
03:56:37,959 --> 03:56:39,959
soothing reply of Dr.

2269
03:56:39,959 --> 03:56:41,959
Nelson resisting the urge

2270
03:56:41,959 --> 03:56:43,959
to roll her eyes

2271
03:56:43,959 --> 03:56:45,959
she was a professional and she had seen

2272
03:56:45,959 --> 03:56:47,959
far stranger than this she kept

2273
03:56:47,959 --> 03:56:49,959
telling herself

2274
03:56:49,959 --> 03:56:51,959
she wasn't going to let someone like this

2275
03:56:51,959 --> 03:56:53,959
break her composure

2276
03:56:53,959 --> 03:56:55,959
Dr. Horowitz Saturday

2277
03:56:55,959 --> 03:56:57,959
silently staring across his desk

2278
03:56:57,959 --> 03:56:59,959
Saturday

2279
03:56:59,959 --> 03:57:01,959
Nelson and the patient

2280
03:57:01,959 --> 03:57:03,959
Jeremy as he had been introduced

2281
03:57:03,959 --> 03:57:05,959
well geez gosh

2282
03:57:05,959 --> 03:57:07,959
I mean the voices

2283
03:57:07,959 --> 03:57:09,959
Jeremy laughed, eyes bugging slightly

2284
03:57:09,959 --> 03:57:12,139
they're just voices

2285
03:57:12,139 --> 03:57:14,139
you know, a couple of them

2286
03:57:14,139 --> 03:57:16,319
not that big a deal

2287
03:57:16,319 --> 03:57:18,319
Jeremy has apparently experienced

2288
03:57:18,319 --> 03:57:20,319
over 11,000 voices

2289
03:57:20,319 --> 03:57:22,319
speaking to him at once

2290
03:57:22,319 --> 03:57:24,319
Jeremy winced as the words

2291
03:57:24,319 --> 03:57:26,319
left drive, Nelson's mouth

2292
03:57:26,319 --> 03:57:28,319
but drive, Horowitz

2293
03:57:28,319 --> 03:57:30,319
D-I-D-N-T react at first

2294
03:57:30,319 --> 03:57:32,319
11,000

2295
03:57:32,319 --> 03:57:34,319
yes sir

2296
03:57:34,319 --> 03:57:36,319
no, that's crazy

2297
03:57:36,319 --> 03:57:38,319
that's the sort of thing a crazy

2298
03:57:38,319 --> 03:57:40,319
person would say

2299
03:57:40,319 --> 03:57:42,319
I'm not crazy

2300
03:57:42,319 --> 03:57:44,319
Jeremy sit down

2301
03:57:44,319 --> 03:57:46,319
Jeremy hyperventilating a little

2302
03:57:46,319 --> 03:57:48,319
Saturday back down in the folding chair

2303
03:57:48,319 --> 03:57:50,319
tell me

2304
03:57:50,319 --> 03:57:52,319
Mr. Elbertson

2305
03:57:52,319 --> 03:57:54,319
what do these voices say

2306
03:57:54,319 --> 03:57:56,319
Jeremy remained silent

2307
03:57:56,319 --> 03:57:58,319
and eventually drive

2308
03:57:58,319 --> 03:58:00,319
Nelson spoke up

2309
03:58:00,319 --> 03:58:02,319
it depends sir, but they seem malevolent

2310
03:58:02,319 --> 03:58:04,319
malevolent

2311
03:58:04,319 --> 03:58:06,319
they encourage dangerous behavior

2312
03:58:06,319 --> 03:58:08,319
they award him points for it

2313
03:58:08,319 --> 03:58:10,319
points

2314
03:58:10,319 --> 03:58:12,319
when he hurts people, breaks things

2315
03:58:12,319 --> 03:58:14,319
makes good jokes, they give him points

2316
03:58:14,319 --> 03:58:16,319
and they take them away

2317
03:58:16,319 --> 03:58:18,319
for wholesome behavior and bad jokes

2318
03:58:18,319 --> 03:58:20,489
I see

2319
03:58:20,489 --> 03:58:22,729
do they do anything else

2320
03:58:22,729 --> 03:58:24,729
they like to

2321
03:58:24,729 --> 03:58:26,729
all at once, Jeremy leapt to his feet

2322
03:58:26,729 --> 03:58:29,420
clutching his head and screaming

2323
03:58:29,420 --> 03:58:31,719
will you all shut up

2324
03:58:31,719 --> 03:58:33,899
talking about my feet

2325
03:58:33,899 --> 03:58:35,899
shut the fuck up

2326
03:58:35,899 --> 03:58:37,899
get off this topic

2327
03:58:37,899 --> 03:58:39,899
no more feet

2328
03:58:39,899 --> 03:58:41,899
before either doctor could attempt to pacify him

2329
03:58:41,899 --> 03:58:43,899
the door to the office slammed open

2330
03:58:43,899 --> 03:58:45,899
and security guards charged in

2331
03:58:45,899 --> 03:58:51,600
to restrain the screaming man

2332
03:58:51,600 --> 03:58:53,600
stop saying it

2333
03:58:53,600 --> 03:58:55,600
the big punch line got cut off

2334
03:58:55,600 --> 03:58:58,729
here's the big punch

2335
03:58:58,729 --> 03:59:02,000
right here

2336
03:59:02,000 --> 03:59:06,860
why did this get cut off

2337
03:59:06,860 --> 03:59:08,860
as he was hauled away, drive

2338
03:59:08,860 --> 03:59:10,860
I'm sorry sir

2339
03:59:10,860 --> 03:59:12,860
both SCP-985

2340
03:59:12,860 --> 03:59:14,860
and its host can be rather unpredictable

2341
03:59:14,860 --> 03:59:16,860
there you go

2342
03:59:16,860 --> 03:59:21,469
SCP-985

2343
03:59:21,469 --> 03:59:25,739
there's your punch line there

2344
03:59:25,739 --> 03:59:27,739
alright, we're gonna do the credits

2345
03:59:27,739 --> 03:59:29,739
the actual credits are gonna be probably right in front of my face

2346
03:59:29,739 --> 03:59:32,430
how do we get them here, let's see

2347
03:59:32,430 --> 03:59:34,430
well, we can go like this

2348
03:59:34,430 --> 03:59:36,430
are they gonna be in front of me, or behind me

2349
03:59:36,430 --> 03:59:39,799
we'll find out

2350
03:59:39,799 --> 03:59:43,260
chat's the true monster

2351
03:59:43,260 --> 03:59:45,440
eh, debatable, I think that's debatable

2352
03:59:45,440 --> 03:59:48,829
alright, am I

2353
03:59:48,829 --> 03:59:50,829
I think in front of me, or behind me

2354
03:59:50,829 --> 03:59:53,770
let's find out

2355
03:59:53,770 --> 03:59:58,120
thanks everybody for your support on these streams

2356
03:59:58,120 --> 04:00:00,680
they're in front of me

2357
04:00:00,680 --> 04:00:02,680
all these people subbed today

2358
04:00:02,680 --> 04:00:04,920
during the stream, whether it was from

2359
04:00:04,920 --> 04:00:07,479
a community sub or not

2360
04:00:07,479 --> 04:00:09,479
or you just decided to stay subbed for 36 months

2361
04:00:09,479 --> 04:00:12,170
in a row

2362
04:00:12,170 --> 04:00:14,920
thank you, all of you

2363
04:00:14,920 --> 04:00:19,079
here you all are

2364
04:00:19,079 --> 04:00:22,030
hell yeah, thanks a lot

2365
04:00:22,030 --> 04:00:24,459
we do have a few more bits to do though

2366
04:00:24,459 --> 04:00:26,459
here, I'll put them on a different screen

2367
04:00:26,459 --> 04:00:29,579
we had

2368
04:00:29,579 --> 04:00:31,579
that was Dr. Zutsu by the way

2369
04:00:31,579 --> 04:00:33,579
thanks for the story, sorry I missed it

2370
04:00:33,579 --> 04:00:35,579
when I was pulling stuff out, I was just gonna go in line by line

2371
04:00:35,579 --> 04:00:37,579
videos and pictures

2372
04:00:37,579 --> 04:00:39,579
I didn't see it

2373
04:00:39,579 --> 04:00:41,579
I just kind of squirreled by it apparently

2374
04:00:41,579 --> 04:00:43,579
it was very very very

2375
04:00:43,579 --> 04:00:45,579
very creepy

2376
04:00:45,579 --> 04:00:47,579
and it was a little twisted

2377
04:00:47,579 --> 04:00:49,579
but thank you, and thanks for your 500 bits too

2378
04:00:49,579 --> 04:00:52,010
GTX 1080 quad SLI

2379
04:00:52,010 --> 04:00:54,010
gave 250 bits

2380
04:00:54,010 --> 04:00:56,569
they say

2381
04:00:56,569 --> 04:00:59,579
why don't you do more things with italics

2382
04:00:59,579 --> 04:01:02,969
we just did something like last week

2383
04:01:02,969 --> 04:01:07,239
which is a twitch con

2384
04:01:07,239 --> 04:01:09,479
but to answer that

2385
04:01:09,479 --> 04:01:11,479
a greater question there

2386
04:01:11,479 --> 04:01:13,479
I don't do very much collaborations anyways

2387
04:01:13,479 --> 04:01:16,620
I think

2388
04:01:16,620 --> 04:01:18,620
it's just me

2389
04:01:18,620 --> 04:01:20,620
organically if you want to do a video or a stream together

2390
04:01:20,620 --> 04:01:22,799
I don't

2391
04:01:22,799 --> 04:01:25,799
typically do

2392
04:01:25,799 --> 04:01:27,799
co-streams or multiplayer streams

2393
04:01:27,799 --> 04:01:29,799
sometimes, but for the most part

2394
04:01:29,799 --> 04:01:31,799
if it makes sense

2395
04:01:31,799 --> 04:01:33,799
then yeah

2396
04:01:33,799 --> 04:01:36,110
but

2397
04:01:36,110 --> 04:01:38,989
I typically just do my own thing

2398
04:01:38,989 --> 04:01:41,479
typically

2399
04:01:41,479 --> 04:01:43,479
and yes I have seen the birthday card, it was fucking incredibly wholesome

2400
04:01:43,479 --> 04:01:45,479
and wonderful, thank you

2401
04:01:45,479 --> 04:01:48,030
we went over it

2402
04:01:48,030 --> 04:01:50,030
I'm completely floored

2403
04:01:50,030 --> 04:01:52,030
that there's that many people that want to say

2404
04:01:52,030 --> 04:01:54,030
that fucking nice things about me

2405
04:01:54,030 --> 04:01:56,969
so, I really appreciate it

2406
04:01:56,969 --> 04:01:59,790
words seriously

2407
04:01:59,790 --> 04:02:01,790
cannot describe the feeling

2408
04:02:01,790 --> 04:02:05,120
when I look at stuff like that

2409
04:02:05,120 --> 04:02:07,120
but, no, to answer the larger question

2410
04:02:07,120 --> 04:02:09,120
like I said

2411
04:02:09,120 --> 04:02:11,120
I get questions a lot about

2412
04:02:11,120 --> 04:02:13,120
hey, you should play with Star some more

2413
04:02:13,120 --> 04:02:15,120
what about Kraken and italics

2414
04:02:15,120 --> 04:02:17,120
you should play with Vinny or Joel

2415
04:02:17,120 --> 04:02:19,120
it has to just sort of happen

2416
04:02:19,120 --> 04:02:21,120
it's not like

2417
04:02:21,120 --> 04:02:23,120
I don't typically go out of my way

2418
04:02:23,120 --> 04:02:25,120
to do much

2419
04:02:25,120 --> 04:02:27,120
multiplayer content with people

2420
04:02:27,120 --> 04:02:29,870
and that's sort of just

2421
04:02:29,870 --> 04:02:32,750
I've been doing that for the last

2422
04:02:32,750 --> 04:02:34,750
five years or so

2423
04:02:34,750 --> 04:02:38,969
kind of, you should play with Ninja

2424
04:02:38,969 --> 04:02:45,180
why did I even read that out loud

2425
04:02:45,180 --> 04:02:49,340
why did I read that

2426
04:02:49,340 --> 04:02:56,829
Vinny said you peed your pants and he doesn't

2427
04:02:56,829 --> 04:02:58,829
need that kind of attention

2428
04:02:58,829 --> 04:03:03,440
I did not pee my pants

2429
04:03:03,440 --> 04:03:09,200
the song makes me sad

2430
04:03:09,200 --> 04:03:11,200
why does the song make you sad

2431
04:03:11,200 --> 04:03:16,000
it still hasn't streamed with Joel

2432
04:03:16,000 --> 04:03:19,639
it just

2433
04:03:19,639 --> 04:03:21,639
it just has to happen, you know what I mean

2434
04:03:21,639 --> 04:03:23,819
well that's not true

2435
04:03:23,819 --> 04:03:26,000
that's not true

2436
04:03:26,000 --> 04:03:29,000
we did the whole fine wrestle

2437
04:03:29,000 --> 04:03:34,000
that was a whole thing

2438
04:03:34,000 --> 04:03:41,799
yeah of course it does

2439
04:03:41,799 --> 04:03:49,159
but I typically just kind of do my own thing

2440
04:03:49,159 --> 04:03:53,319
that's kind of the shrug

2441
04:03:53,319 --> 04:03:56,590
you have to take the initiative

2442
04:03:56,590 --> 04:03:59,790
but I kind of just do my own thing

2443
04:03:59,790 --> 04:04:02,479
and I just bump you

2444
04:04:02,479 --> 04:04:06,489
bump you in the face

2445
04:04:06,489 --> 04:04:12,190
that's a big gamer shrug

2446
04:04:12,190 --> 04:04:15,260
to be honest you're much better as a solo act

2447
04:04:15,260 --> 04:04:17,950
I don't

2448
04:04:17,950 --> 04:04:19,950
I don't know if I necessarily agree with that

2449
04:04:19,950 --> 04:04:22,959
but

2450
04:04:22,959 --> 04:04:24,959
I'm like at my most comfortable

2451
04:04:24,959 --> 04:04:27,450
when I can kind of

2452
04:04:27,450 --> 04:04:29,450
just do whatever and kind of say whatever

2453
04:04:29,450 --> 04:04:31,450
and just kind of just be me

2454
04:04:31,450 --> 04:04:34,649
I've actually had this conversation before

2455
04:04:34,649 --> 04:04:36,649
about why won't you do this

2456
04:04:36,649 --> 04:04:38,649
or why you could play with that group or this group

2457
04:04:38,649 --> 04:04:40,649
it's because

2458
04:04:40,649 --> 04:04:42,649
maybe I am a little more comfortable

2459
04:04:42,649 --> 04:04:44,829
solo, maybe it is

2460
04:04:44,829 --> 04:04:52,510
maybe that is what it is

2461
04:04:52,510 --> 04:04:58,010
and obviously with all of you

2462
04:04:58,010 --> 04:05:00,010
I prefer solo less to comprehend from my tiny brain

2463
04:05:00,010 --> 04:05:05,000
my tiny brain

2464
04:05:05,000 --> 04:05:09,360
but I don't know sometimes stuff just randomly comes up

2465
04:05:09,360 --> 04:05:11,360
like for instance like Star

2466
04:05:11,360 --> 04:05:13,360
and Terraria it was just like

2467
04:05:13,360 --> 04:05:16,170
there was no plan there

2468
04:05:16,170 --> 04:05:18,170
it wasn't like oh we're going to do this

2469
04:05:18,170 --> 04:05:20,170
we should do this, we should do this more often

2470
04:05:20,170 --> 04:05:22,170
it was just like I want to fucking play Terraria

2471
04:05:22,170 --> 04:05:24,170
and you do too

2472
04:05:24,170 --> 04:05:27,950
let's do it, let's just play it, let's beat it

2473
04:05:27,950 --> 04:05:29,950
that's just kind of how it works

2474
04:05:29,950 --> 04:05:34,559
and that's how it will continue to work

2475
04:05:34,559 --> 04:05:38,250
what did he say?

2476
04:05:38,250 --> 04:05:41,520
Dermis Sauer

2477
04:05:41,520 --> 04:05:43,520
oh yeah I didn't put that, Dermis lied about it

2478
04:05:43,520 --> 04:05:45,520
no it's not

2479
04:05:45,520 --> 04:05:47,520
I have like four hours to put Dermis Sauer as an emote

2480
04:05:47,520 --> 04:05:54,239
but let's finish this up

2481
04:05:54,239 --> 04:05:56,600
let's get to the end

2482
04:05:56,600 --> 04:05:58,909
we are at the end

2483
04:05:58,909 --> 04:06:02,940
and that means we switch over to the real end

2484
04:06:02,940 --> 04:06:09,319
this one

2485
04:06:09,319 --> 04:06:11,319
we have 250 from Gnarly

2486
04:06:11,319 --> 04:06:13,319
at the end here, thank you

2487
04:06:13,319 --> 04:06:15,319
thanks for showing my Soul Calibur Glueman on stream

2488
04:06:15,319 --> 04:06:17,319
I don't know if I uploaded it right

2489
04:06:17,319 --> 04:06:19,319
but that was supposed to be a whole photo album of characters

2490
04:06:19,319 --> 04:06:21,319
regardless happen to have my shitty Glueman

2491
04:06:21,319 --> 04:06:23,319
next to some really high quality fan art

2492
04:06:24,319 --> 04:06:28,420
that was great

2493
04:06:28,420 --> 04:06:30,420
I don't think other ones popped up

2494
04:06:30,420 --> 04:06:33,620
but it was still awesome

2495
04:06:33,620 --> 04:06:36,370
it was still very very very good

2496
04:06:36,370 --> 04:06:38,370
good shit, I didn't even know that had that good of a character creator

2497
04:06:38,370 --> 04:06:40,370
until somebody told me about it

2498
04:06:40,370 --> 04:06:42,370
I was like damn, cool

2499
04:06:42,370 --> 04:06:44,870
but no it was great

2500
04:06:44,870 --> 04:06:46,870
Freudian Weapon thanks for the 250

2501
04:06:46,870 --> 04:06:48,870
this community content is a great idea

2502
04:06:48,870 --> 04:06:50,870
I'll definitely make some art for the next one

2503
04:06:50,870 --> 04:06:52,870
and good luck with the doctors, be well

2504
04:06:52,870 --> 04:06:58,290
I'm gonna try

2505
04:06:58,290 --> 04:07:00,290
I am gonna try

2506
04:07:00,290 --> 04:07:03,430
I'm not too concerned about it

2507
04:07:03,430 --> 04:07:06,049
but

2508
04:07:06,049 --> 04:07:08,049
there has been

2509
04:07:08,049 --> 04:07:10,049
just a random nagging issue

2510
04:07:10,049 --> 04:07:13,059
that has been around for a while

2511
04:07:13,059 --> 04:07:15,059
and it's not anything to do with my intestinal problems

2512
04:07:15,059 --> 04:07:17,059
at least not that I've been able to

2513
04:07:17,059 --> 04:07:19,059
because I had the colonoscopy, remember?

2514
04:07:19,059 --> 04:07:21,059
that was because of these symptoms

2515
04:07:21,059 --> 04:07:25,670
I wanted to check on a few things

2516
04:07:25,670 --> 04:07:28,680
keep going to see what the hell is going on

2517
04:07:28,680 --> 04:07:32,709
but I mean I feel fine

2518
04:07:32,709 --> 04:07:34,709
I'm okay, I'm fine, I'm not sick or anything

2519
04:07:34,709 --> 04:07:37,079
like I'm just

2520
04:07:37,079 --> 04:07:39,079
there's nothing going on internally there

2521
04:07:39,079 --> 04:07:41,079
that once I find out

2522
04:07:41,079 --> 04:07:43,079
what the hell it is

2523
04:07:43,079 --> 04:07:45,079
just do it, figure it out

2524
04:07:45,079 --> 04:07:50,180
I'm not concerned

2525
04:07:50,180 --> 04:07:52,180
do I have a FODMAP problem?

2526
04:07:52,180 --> 04:07:54,180
that's what they thought it was at first

2527
04:07:54,180 --> 04:07:56,420
but I'm not sure that's what it is

2528
04:07:56,420 --> 04:07:58,420
I get like this bad

2529
04:07:58,420 --> 04:08:00,420
abdominal pain that sits like under my rib cage

2530
04:08:00,420 --> 04:08:02,420
like on my right side

2531
04:08:02,420 --> 04:08:04,420
and it's kind of right in the center

2532
04:08:04,420 --> 04:08:06,420
so they want to do an ultrasound

2533
04:08:06,420 --> 04:08:08,420
on gallbladder and

2534
04:08:08,420 --> 04:08:10,420
check out the organs

2535
04:08:10,420 --> 04:08:15,479
just make sure they're all working properly

2536
04:08:15,479 --> 04:08:17,479
and it's peace of mind too, just to make sure you know

2537
04:08:17,479 --> 04:08:21,700
I want to stay on top of it

2538
04:08:21,700 --> 04:08:24,200
I guess, but thank you Frodeon

2539
04:08:24,200 --> 04:08:26,200
Bala Koala, thank you for the thousand bits

2540
04:08:26,200 --> 04:08:28,200
play more N-G-U

2541
04:08:31,399 --> 04:08:33,399
that's a great game but

2542
04:08:33,399 --> 04:08:36,280
I don't think you'll see that on stream anymore

2543
04:08:36,280 --> 04:08:39,920
we hit him too hard with the frog

2544
04:08:39,920 --> 04:08:41,920
could be irritable bowel syndrome

2545
04:08:41,920 --> 04:08:44,479
well I have irritable bowel disease

2546
04:08:44,479 --> 04:08:47,040
I was diagnosed with colitis

2547
04:08:47,040 --> 04:08:49,040
10 years ago

2548
04:08:49,040 --> 04:08:51,040
maybe a little bit more, like 12 years ago

2549
04:08:51,040 --> 04:08:53,040
the symptoms are different

2550
04:08:53,040 --> 04:08:55,799
they're not the ones that I'm typically used to

2551
04:08:57,799 --> 04:09:04,639
we'll figure it out

2552
04:09:04,639 --> 04:09:06,639
you won't see that on stream anymore

2553
04:09:06,639 --> 04:09:08,639
it's a great game but

2554
04:09:08,639 --> 04:09:11,909
I probably will move on from it

2555
04:09:11,909 --> 04:09:13,909
but thanks for the thousand bits, appreciate it

2556
04:09:13,909 --> 04:09:16,920
Bala Koala

2557
04:09:16,920 --> 04:09:18,920
also C4G, thanks for the 250, hey Jerma

2558
04:09:18,920 --> 04:09:21,409
I did the Ace Attorney video

2559
04:09:21,409 --> 04:09:23,409
I had a bit I wanted to include where the judge

2560
04:09:23,409 --> 04:09:25,409
gavel on the emote only button

2561
04:09:25,409 --> 04:09:27,409
but I was in a rush to finish it in time

2562
04:09:27,409 --> 04:09:29,409
and forgot to include it

2563
04:09:29,409 --> 04:09:31,909
I'm glad people seem to like the video

2564
04:09:31,909 --> 04:09:33,909
even if you won't admit to your crimes

2565
04:09:33,909 --> 04:09:37,040
that's fucking funny

2566
04:09:37,040 --> 04:09:39,989
that's fucking funny

2567
04:09:39,989 --> 04:09:46,129
but

2568
04:09:46,129 --> 04:09:48,129
it still was great regardless of any

2569
04:09:48,129 --> 04:09:50,129
finishing touches, so

2570
04:09:50,129 --> 04:09:52,129
thank you so much for that, it was fantastic

2571
04:09:52,129 --> 04:09:55,780
Superintendent Chalmers, thanks for the 250

2572
04:09:55,780 --> 04:09:57,780
hey Jerma, when you were talking about taxes and whatnot

2573
04:09:57,780 --> 04:09:59,780
I immediately thought of this

2574
04:09:59,780 --> 04:10:12,579
white suburban punk, just like me

2575
04:10:21,729 --> 04:10:26,709
what?

2576
04:10:26,709 --> 04:10:28,709
taxes?

2577
04:10:28,709 --> 04:10:42,709
taxes?

2578
04:10:42,709 --> 04:10:46,040
repo man?

2579
04:10:46,040 --> 04:10:48,040
click on the album, click on the album

2580
04:10:52,040 --> 04:10:54,659
hold on

2581
04:10:54,659 --> 04:10:56,659
don't click on the album, why?

2582
04:10:56,659 --> 04:10:58,659
why why why why why

2583
04:10:58,659 --> 04:11:00,659
what's in it, what's in it, what's in it

2584
04:11:00,659 --> 04:11:05,840
what did you make me click on?

2585
04:11:05,840 --> 04:11:12,360
one fucking guy, it's just

2586
04:11:12,360 --> 04:11:15,809
a one guy

2587
04:11:15,809 --> 04:11:17,809
oh I see the album though, hold on we'll go through this in a second

2588
04:11:17,809 --> 04:11:19,809
let's get to the end of the bits, there's only two more

2589
04:11:19,809 --> 04:11:21,809
two more

2590
04:11:21,809 --> 04:11:28,469
two more

2591
04:11:28,469 --> 04:11:30,469
and they are, that was from

2592
04:11:30,469 --> 04:11:32,469
Superintendent Chalmers

2593
04:11:32,469 --> 04:11:34,639
silent serenity thanks for the 250

2594
04:11:34,639 --> 04:11:36,639
silent serenity right now

2595
04:11:36,639 --> 04:11:38,639
Jerma, I'm not sure if I told this story before but I'm gonna

2596
04:11:38,639 --> 04:11:40,639
so I'm going to, since I was reminded

2597
04:11:40,639 --> 04:11:42,639
of it anyways, years ago when I

2598
04:11:42,639 --> 04:11:44,639
was still in high school I had to write

2599
04:11:44,639 --> 04:11:46,639
a play for English class

2600
04:11:46,639 --> 04:11:48,639
so what did I write about?

2601
04:11:48,639 --> 04:11:50,639
the egg of course

2602
04:11:50,639 --> 04:11:52,639
I adapted the original egg video

2603
04:11:52,639 --> 04:11:54,639
into my script, my teacher loved it

2604
04:11:54,639 --> 04:11:56,639
so I hope you don't mind that I plagiarized

2605
04:11:56,639 --> 04:11:59,520
what did you get for a grade?

2606
04:11:59,520 --> 04:12:05,219
did you get an A?

2607
04:12:05,219 --> 04:12:07,649
because that's only

2608
04:12:07,649 --> 04:12:09,649
okay if you got an A

2609
04:12:09,649 --> 04:12:14,520
if you got a C-

2610
04:12:14,520 --> 04:12:19,040
or worse, then that would

2611
04:12:19,040 --> 04:12:21,040
upset me a little because that means that

2612
04:12:21,040 --> 04:12:23,040
a teacher doesn't understand

2613
04:12:23,040 --> 04:12:30,530
true artwork

2614
04:12:30,530 --> 04:12:42,739
below average

2615
04:12:42,739 --> 04:12:45,620
because it's true art

2616
04:12:45,620 --> 04:12:49,780
is what that is

2617
04:12:49,780 --> 04:12:51,780
but Phylactery gave another

2618
04:12:51,780 --> 04:12:53,780
five thousand bits

2619
04:12:53,780 --> 04:12:55,780
may as well be

2620
04:12:55,780 --> 04:12:57,780
five thousand dollars at this point

2621
04:12:57,780 --> 04:13:01,430
total, thank you Phylactery

2622
04:13:01,430 --> 04:13:05,010
this is another video here

2623
04:13:05,010 --> 04:13:07,010
it's another Jimmy Neutron

2624
04:13:07,010 --> 04:13:09,010
video

2625
04:13:09,010 --> 04:13:11,760
how do you have all these Jimmy Neutron

2626
04:13:11,760 --> 04:13:13,760
clips just ready to go?

2627
04:13:13,760 --> 04:13:19,200
where are you getting the Jimmy Neutron

2628
04:13:19,200 --> 04:13:40,450
clips?

2629
04:13:40,450 --> 04:13:42,879
oh hi Jimmy

2630
04:13:42,879 --> 04:13:44,879
I have to do a report on snails or

2631
04:13:44,879 --> 04:13:46,879
napoleon, can you help me?

2632
04:13:46,879 --> 04:13:48,879
what's the point of doing homework

2633
04:13:48,879 --> 04:13:50,879
we do it and then what?

2634
04:13:50,879 --> 04:13:53,569
poof, we're gone

2635
04:13:53,569 --> 04:13:55,569
emptiness, we're all just dust in the wind

2636
04:13:55,569 --> 04:13:57,569
okay

2637
04:13:57,569 --> 04:13:59,569
I don't want to be dust in the wind

2638
04:13:59,569 --> 04:14:01,569
is that from the thing

2639
04:14:01,569 --> 04:14:03,569
we were talking about?

2640
04:14:03,569 --> 04:14:05,569
he got clipped into

2641
04:14:05,569 --> 04:14:07,569
five different Jimmy Neutrons?

2642
04:14:07,569 --> 04:14:09,809
oh okay right

2643
04:14:09,809 --> 04:14:11,809
like I said every cartoon has done that

2644
04:14:11,809 --> 04:14:15,909
thanks a lot Jimmy

2645
04:14:15,909 --> 04:14:17,909
well not Jimmy Neutron

2646
04:14:17,909 --> 04:14:24,049
Jimmy Neutron did not give me that clip

2647
04:14:24,049 --> 04:14:26,049
I misclicked, hold on

2648
04:14:26,049 --> 04:14:39,350
go back over here

2649
04:14:39,350 --> 04:14:41,350
but thank you Phylactery

2650
04:14:41,350 --> 04:14:43,350
and let's show the images

2651
04:14:43,350 --> 04:14:45,350
of, wait wait wait wait

2652
04:14:45,350 --> 04:14:47,350
somebody link me that image gallery

2653
04:14:47,350 --> 04:14:49,350
again of the

2654
04:14:49,350 --> 04:14:51,350
the characters from Soul Calibur

2655
04:14:51,350 --> 04:14:53,350
thank you

2656
04:14:53,350 --> 04:14:58,340
that is okay

2657
04:14:58,340 --> 04:15:00,709
that's one, that's one, that's one

2658
04:15:00,709 --> 04:15:02,879
alright, let's scroll through this

2659
04:15:02,879 --> 04:15:16,239
in the right spot though

2660
04:15:16,239 --> 04:15:19,319
go back to here

2661
04:15:19,319 --> 04:15:21,319
do a German Rumble special edition

2662
04:15:21,319 --> 04:15:23,750
special edition

2663
04:15:23,750 --> 04:15:26,180
they're all special, anytime

2664
04:15:26,180 --> 04:15:32,709
I'm still on Jimmy

2665
04:15:32,709 --> 04:15:34,709
that's on the stream dashboard

2666
04:15:34,709 --> 04:15:36,709
so, I mean that's incorrect

2667
04:15:36,709 --> 04:15:38,709
I don't know where it's pulling that from

2668
04:15:38,709 --> 04:15:49,719
password leaked

2669
04:15:49,719 --> 04:15:51,719
this is just like the stream bits

2670
04:15:51,719 --> 04:15:54,850
this is from the German Mustard site

2671
04:15:54,850 --> 04:15:56,850
it's way better

2672
04:15:56,850 --> 04:16:02,799
than stream labs

2673
04:16:02,799 --> 04:16:07,670
where

2674
04:16:07,670 --> 04:16:10,870
hold on

2675
04:16:10,870 --> 04:16:15,540
shouldn't it be this one right here

2676
04:16:15,540 --> 04:16:17,969
it is this one right here

2677
04:16:17,969 --> 04:16:21,280
so what the hell is this one

2678
04:16:21,280 --> 04:16:23,280
so this is this one

2679
04:16:23,280 --> 04:16:25,280
let's take a look at these, this is a glue man

2680
04:16:25,280 --> 04:16:29,959
pretty sick

2681
04:16:29,959 --> 04:16:33,409
I told you there was a lot of tabs

2682
04:16:33,409 --> 04:16:35,409
this looks like Super Jex

2683
04:16:35,409 --> 04:16:37,409
that's super blue screen

2684
04:16:37,409 --> 04:16:44,709
odd Michael

2685
04:16:44,709 --> 04:16:50,850
pretty good

2686
04:16:50,850 --> 04:16:53,479
that's deep

2687
04:16:53,479 --> 04:16:57,750
wow

2688
04:16:57,750 --> 04:16:59,750
that's pretty great actually

2689
04:16:59,750 --> 04:17:01,750
Socrates, the fifth turtle

2690
04:17:01,750 --> 04:17:06,159
is the clown joke

2691
04:17:06,159 --> 04:17:08,159
that's very accurate actually

2692
04:17:08,159 --> 04:17:12,000
what it really looked like

2693
04:17:12,000 --> 04:17:14,000
clown joke, bat boy

2694
04:17:14,000 --> 04:17:17,840
you've been busy

2695
04:17:17,840 --> 04:17:19,840
these are awesome, I don't know if this is

2696
04:17:19,840 --> 04:17:22,659
detailed

2697
04:17:22,659 --> 04:17:29,639
the pirate spy

2698
04:17:29,639 --> 04:17:36,340
this is ridiculous

2699
04:17:36,340 --> 04:17:38,639
jewel wizardry

2700
04:17:38,639 --> 04:17:40,639
you have the wizard from jewel

2701
04:17:40,639 --> 04:17:47,170
wizardry

2702
04:17:47,170 --> 04:17:49,170
this is a candy man

2703
04:17:49,170 --> 04:17:52,309
from

2704
04:17:52,309 --> 04:17:55,510
brutal lethal league

2705
04:17:55,510 --> 04:17:59,670
say it

2706
04:17:59,670 --> 04:18:01,670
I can't say it

2707
04:18:01,670 --> 04:18:03,670
say the thing

2708
04:18:03,670 --> 04:18:05,670
I can't do it

2709
04:18:05,670 --> 04:18:07,670
I have to have just had a coffee

2710
04:18:07,670 --> 04:18:11,250
I'm really excited

2711
04:18:11,250 --> 04:18:14,579
this is Jevil

2712
04:18:14,579 --> 04:18:17,329
these are awesome

2713
04:18:17,329 --> 04:18:19,569
Sekiro

2714
04:18:19,569 --> 04:18:24,370
this is easy Pete

2715
04:18:24,370 --> 04:18:26,370
I can't believe that these are so detailed

2716
04:18:26,370 --> 04:18:29,959
this is awesome

2717
04:18:29,959 --> 04:18:32,899
nice work

2718
04:18:32,899 --> 04:18:34,899
awesome job

2719
04:18:34,899 --> 04:18:36,899
that's a lot

2720
04:18:36,899 --> 04:18:38,899
somebody who makes characters

2721
04:18:38,899 --> 04:18:40,899
and spends time on them

2722
04:18:40,899 --> 04:18:42,899
I know how long these take

2723
04:18:42,899 --> 04:18:45,969
it's deceiving

2724
04:18:45,969 --> 04:18:47,969
please

2725
04:18:47,969 --> 04:18:52,879
I'm going to leave this open

2726
04:18:52,879 --> 04:18:55,639
I'm going to leave this open

2727
04:18:55,639 --> 04:18:57,639
and I'm going to put a blanket behind my computer's fan

2728
04:18:57,639 --> 04:19:07,489
because I feel like it

2729
04:19:07,489 --> 04:19:13,639
but that's it

2730
04:19:13,639 --> 04:19:17,860
I will see you guys

2731
04:19:17,860 --> 04:19:20,290
on Monday

2732
04:19:20,290 --> 04:19:22,290
Monday probably around 4

2733
04:19:22,290 --> 04:19:24,290
just because I have that appointment

2734
04:19:24,290 --> 04:19:26,290
I know we've been doing streams at around 1.30

2735
04:19:26,290 --> 04:19:28,290
1.00, 1.00, 2.00

2736
04:19:28,290 --> 04:19:30,290
that's where they're going to be permanently

2737
04:19:30,290 --> 04:19:32,290
but just because of the doctor's appointment

2738
04:19:32,290 --> 04:19:34,290
that's what it was a few weeks ago

2739
04:19:34,290 --> 04:19:36,290
around 4 o'clock

2740
04:19:36,290 --> 04:19:40,200
just to let you know and make sure you're aware

2741
04:19:40,200 --> 04:19:42,200
I will see you Monday

2742
04:19:42,200 --> 04:19:44,200
have a great weekend everybody

2743
04:19:44,200 --> 04:19:46,200
thank you for participating in that community night

2744
04:19:46,200 --> 04:19:48,200
I thought it was a fucking blast

2745
04:19:48,200 --> 04:19:50,879
much love to you all

2746
04:19:50,879 --> 04:19:53,190
see you Monday

2747
04:19:53,190 --> 04:19:55,190
good night guys
