1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,630
Yeah, I found a- oh my god, there's four, like, police helicopters here. There's so many RPGs.

2
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,810
Oh, Ster, what are you doing?

3
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,809
I, like, drove up there. You're already gone.

4
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:21,809
I'm climbing up the top of this, like, construction beam.

5
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:24,980
I'll fly this over to you so you can get the weapons.

6
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,379
I just gotta be able to fly without crashing into-

7
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:29,379
Oh, wow.

8
00:00:29,379 --> 00:00:30,379
It's a long way up.

9
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:38,579
They're so confused, they, like, can't get over- they, like, don't know what to do.

10
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,579
They're just, like, all down there.

11
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,039
Some of these guys are just walking around in circles.

12
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:50,990
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

13
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:51,990
What have I done?

14
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,229
What'd you do?

15
00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:54,229
Run?

16
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:55,229
Oh!

17
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:56,409
Oh!

18
00:00:56,409 --> 00:00:58,409
Oh, no!

19
00:00:58,409 --> 00:00:59,969
Don't fall down the hole!

20
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:01,399
What?

21
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:04,540
What just happened there?

22
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:10,159
You dropped- you dropped, like, a bomb behind me and it blew me down the hole!

23
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:15,159
Oh, no!

24
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:19,099
What? What?

25
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:21,099
All I heard was, oops, that's not good.

26
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:26,099
And all of a sudden I just fly forward and my body rolls into the freaking hole.

27
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:29,099
It went down the tube?

28
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:34,099
Yeah, I rolled- like, I was, like, a piece of, like, hair going down a bathroom sink.

29
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:37,430
Oh, no!

30
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,640
Dude, some dealership just, like, made out, like, a bandit.

31
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,640
All these poor ladies do legs.

32
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,640
They really all are the same car.

33
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,640
Hey, look, everybody has, like, a Saturn.

34
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,250
Maybe run her over.

35
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,620
Holy cow.

36
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,620
Yeah, I need assault now. I'm one shot.

37
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,620
I'm out of ammo in my assault rifle.

38
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,620
I can't believe that helicopter- what is this helicopter doing?

39
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,620
What is this guy doing?

40
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,620
Wow, what an idiot.

41
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,620
There he is!

42
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,620
I just saw him.

43
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,620
I'm all by myself.

44
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,620
This is a helicopter graveyard.

45
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,620
This is, like, 30 helicopters here.

46
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,620
Whoa! Oh, my God!

47
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,020
Oh, my-

48
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,020
30 helicopters here.

49
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,020
Yeah!

50
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:47,729
Oh, my God!

51
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,979
I just, like, elbowed it.

52
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:56,979
Oh, it's still there on my screen.

53
00:02:56,979 --> 00:03:00,689
I'm keeping this one.

54
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:02,689
Here we go.

55
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:04,689
It's time to obey the rules of the road.

56
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:07,060
Starting now.

57
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,060
We are now law-abiding citizens.

58
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,060
Is there, like, a speed limit button?

59
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,060
Yeah.

60
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,060
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

61
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,060
Police officer.

62
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,060
Oh, that guy just passed us.

63
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,060
Yeah, what was that all about?

64
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,060
It was a police officer.

65
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,060
You're supposed to pull to the right.

66
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,060
Oh, excuse me!

67
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,060
All right, I'm going to be-

68
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,060
My right blinker is on.

69
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,060
I'm going to be taking a right-hand turn here.

70
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,060
I broke your right taillight by accident.

71
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,060
Hey, look at this guy.

72
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,060
Hey, you need to calm down, buddy.

73
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,060
He's taking a left-

74
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,060
His left blinker is on.

75
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,060
He's in the middle of the road.

76
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,060
Look at this guy's head.

77
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,060
Oh my god.

78
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,060
What is this cop doing?

79
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,740
Oh my god.

80
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,740
What?

81
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,740
I'm not absorbing this.

82
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,740
Does anybody have a star?

83
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:07,740
I may have three stars by accident.

84
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,740
You have three stars?

85
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,740
Oh, this cop is right next to me.

86
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,740
He's going to pull down.

87
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,740
I'm still obeying the rules, not my problem.

88
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,740
Drive safely.

89
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,740
He's in my car.

90
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,740
This guy's passing-

91
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,740
I'm trying to let him pass.

92
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,740
Oh, boo, it's in your car.

93
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,740
It's a red light.

94
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,740
It's a red light.

95
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,740
It's green, it's green.

96
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,740
We have to get them away from you.

97
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,740
It's a red light, boo. I don't think we can go yet.

98
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,740
It's green, it's green.

99
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,740
It's a shotgun!

100
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,740
Get out of here.

101
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,740
Get out of here.

102
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,740
Oh my god.

103
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,740
It's so bossy.

104
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,740
She's trying to drive safely.

105
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,740
Alright, Steph, I'm going to be taking a left-hand turn here.

106
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,740
I'm taking fire on my vehicle.

107
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,980
My car! Look how scratched it is.

108
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,980
Oh no.

109
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,980
The cop, man.

110
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,980
He's like pulling up alongside.

111
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,980
Oh, it's green.

112
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,980
Go left.

113
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,980
Oh no, there's a one-way.

114
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,980
There's a one-way back up.

115
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,980
There's a one-way.

116
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,980
They're pushing us sideways.

117
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,980
That's a one-way.

118
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,980
I think boo turned all the way around.

119
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,980
I saw that.

120
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,220
No, no, no. No one noticed.

121
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,220
Alright, actually, can we pull over for a second, guys?

122
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,779
I kind of want a hot dog.

123
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:38,779
I'm kind of hungry.

124
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:40,779
I kind of want a hot dog.

125
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:42,779
There's no vendor there.

126
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:44,779
Is it closed?

127
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:46,779
What?

128
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,779
What happened there?

129
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:51,920
Disconnected from live.

130
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,569
Too bad there's no vendor here.

131
00:05:55,569 --> 00:05:57,569
My car!

132
00:05:57,569 --> 00:05:59,810
My car!
