00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:13,820
Hello. Good afternoon, everybody. EU stream. Well, it's a few hours early.

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:19,929
I have 1.30, 2.30, 3.34. Yeah, like two and a half hours early. There's a reason for it though.

3
00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:26,539
I wanted to make sure I could get at least a solid three hours, four hours in today.

4
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:33,100
I got a lot of shit to do. I'm just running around in circles. And I mean that, dude,

5
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,380
I mean that quite literally. When the stream ends, I just, I still have a bunch of pent up energy and

6
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:46,170
I fucking just sprint in a circle for like 15 minutes and then I go to bed. You know how hard

7
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:53,100
it is to sprint in a circle? Have you guys ever tried that? Like a five, 10 foot circle?

8
00:00:53,100 --> 00:01:05,430
Can you sprint in a circle? You can't. It's too hard. Like a 10 foot circle. No, no, you can't.

9
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:11,480
Did you drink your shower water again? No, I put it in my mouth and I spit it out.

10
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:19,879
Like every normal human on earth. But today, like I said, starting early because I want to make sure

11
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:24,489
I can stream for a few hours, we're going to play something that's going to take probably a few

12
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:29,590
hours. And that is, I mean, you guys are going to be really happy about this. Those of you that

13
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:36,329
weren't here over the last few days, I'm going to say this game and you're going to go, what the,

14
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:45,659
what? Ikaruga. Your speakers just went and like blew you away. Your like mouth is flapping back.

15
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:54,680
You can't fucking believe it. When I just said that word. Ikaruga is a shoot them up. It is a

16
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:03,129
bullet hell game and it's considered to be one of the best ever made. Now that's not according to me.

17
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:15,509
That's according to every single person I've ever known in my whole life. Now this is a pug. Yeah.

18
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:23,849
Play the real one. Touhou. All right. I'm going to have to be honest with you here.

19
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:34,819
All right. The, the more that people tell me to do something, you know, the less inclined I am to

20
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:45,060
actually do that thing, right? The more that people say, play this game, the more I go,

21
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:55,349
ah, maybe I don't want to do that. Like I've seen play Touhou even I'm talking like six months ago.

22
00:02:55,349 --> 00:03:07,539
Just people just write it and that's like the only thing they write. Don't play Touhou. I mean,

23
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:17,180
maybe I will. I don't know. He hates us. Don't take your shirt off on stream. I don't, I don't

24
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:23,539
think I'll be doing that one. I don't plan on that one, but anyways, let's go. I'm going to play

25
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:35,560
Ikaruga. It looks fucking awesome. It looks so good. I looked at it and I was like, wow,

26
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,930
this one's going to be a good one. Let's take a look. What do you think?

27
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:49,740
Already the menu is clean. Is this, is this, is this loud? You tell me this is loud. Okay.

28
00:03:52,650 --> 00:04:03,800
Why do you say, oh no. Somebody said, oh no. Why? Oh no. This doesn't have blood. No,

29
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,740
but it's got explosions. All right. All right. As long as it got explosions and you got,

30
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:13,960
that's fine. Count me in. You're going to be digging a hole in this one? No, no, I promise.

31
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:20,490
Okay. Thank God. Last like six streams have been you digging holes, bro. No, I promised there'll be

32
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:36,629
explosions. Okay. Better be. All right. Select with the stick. Decide with the button. This is a

33
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:42,300
little loud for me. All right. Arcade mode, the default arcade mode, prototype mode has the limit

34
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:49,430
of the shots. Chapter select, select the level to play. Let's just do arcade mode, right?

35
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,819
We can try the other modes later. This has got to be turned down by the way. All right.

36
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:13,660
There's three difficulties. It's easy, normal, and hard. Whoa. What just happened? Why did that

37
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:18,939
just do that? What was that? I didn't even hear that. I just saw that. I saw the, I saw the audio

38
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:24,779
go up to like a thousand. What happened? Oh, you're going to get blown away. You're going to get

39
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:31,980
blown away when I say the words Ikarunga and your face is going to be flapping. I'm sorry. I didn't

40
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:37,459
mean, I don't know what happened. I didn't do anything. Okay. Please don't do that again.

41
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:43,300
The fuck are you doing? I didn't do anything. I just was like changing the audio level over

42
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,939
here. I didn't do anything. All right. Enemies with the same polarity return fire. That sounds

43
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:55,579
like fun. All right. Enemies. I mean, let me try a normal first. What a fucking professional streamer.

44
00:05:55,579 --> 00:06:01,899
It, it did that on its own. I didn't do anything. I'm doing normal first. I will not die until I

45
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:08,699
achieve something. Even though the ideal, I didn't read that. Don't you know not to use

46
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:18,810
fucking vertical video? How do I move? The move. Oh, it's WASD. All right. WASD. I'm already dead.

47
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:26,180
All right. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm dead again. All right. Chapter one.

48
00:06:28,579 --> 00:06:35,560
I can't even read that. It's too fast. There's like, you have to switch polarity in this game.

49
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:42,759
You can absorb bullets if you're the same polarity. You, I looked at the fucking instructions before

50
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:49,319
we played. If you absorb bullets of the same polarity, listen to me, then you can do extra

51
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:54,360
damage. For instance, see if there's white and black, black and white. That's it. I'm dead again

52
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:02,779
and I lose. All right. Cool. Well, uh, we'll get, all right, let's go. Now uploading the replay.

53
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:11,959
Don't upload the fucking replay. I don't want someone to up see that replay. What do you mean

54
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:16,680
upload the replay? No, I don't want to upload a fucking replay. All right. So that's how it works.

55
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:22,680
It's games considered one of the hardest games ever made too. Just, I forgot to mention that.

56
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:28,019
I didn't even know what the buttons were. All right. Let me explain. Let's do some explanations

57
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:40,279
here. Thank God there's no replay. Thank God. Wait.

58
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:17,540
You get three lives. Okay. You get three lives and after you die three times, it's over. But

59
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:24,730
this polarity, as you see, the game's fucking fantastic. You have to absorb bullets of the

60
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:32,389
same polarity as you see in this replay. Check that out. See black goes into black and then

61
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:42,570
as you see, wait, what's wrong? Okay. What are you doing? All right. That one's done. He's not even

62
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:48,870
actually playing. No, I'm just watching a cool replay. All right. Let me try this again. We've

63
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:57,529
got to get through. And you guys want me to play on hard. Have you lost your mind? You want me to

64
00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:04,870
play on hard. This is an actual fake. That was real gameplay that I previously, that was previously

65
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:11,820
recorded gameplay. Let Otto play the game. All right. Let's try this again. So remember polarity

66
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,980
is important. Let's see if I can do. I didn't even know W. I thought it was move with the mouse.

67
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:31,269
You do double damage to people of this, of the opposite polarity. Oh, this is pretty sick

68
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:36,360
actually. All right. And then I can do a super move. If I press mouse four, I can shoot out homing

69
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:55,340
missiles. Can you hear me? Can you guys hear me? Just don't run into anybody. Watch out. You can

70
00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:07,590
get a, if you get three people in a row, you get a chain by the way. Like that. I have two chains.

71
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:20,460
Okay. Cool. Wait. Oh dear God. All right. Kill the, kill the one on the right first. Double damage,

72
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:34,950
right? Holy shit. That was actually really cool. Fuck. Sorry. I got three lives. I'm all right.

73
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:43,269
After this, I'm going to have to see what's going on with Otto. He wants to get out.

74
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:50,039
Absorb that whole thing. Whoa. Is that going to hit me if they go from behind there?

75
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,320
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. I've changed. Oh my God. Change polarity again. I can absorb. Oh,

76
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:08,710
fuck. Oh my God. What do I do? It's so confusing, but it's actually really cool.

77
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:22,120
I have to hit them. I didn't kill them. Wait, this is, am I the boss? But this is on normal

78
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:36,940
difficulty. I have one health. Is he white? Yep. Oh man. Fuck. God. All right. Hold on. I think

79
00:11:36,940 --> 00:12:39,590
Otto needs to go outside. I'll be right back. He's okay. He's, he's starting to get nervous

80
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:48,700
because of the boxes. If you ever move with a dog before, they start to see you pack up shit

81
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:53,669
and they, they don't like it. They're like, let's go. What are you doing? Like, why are you doing

82
00:12:53,669 --> 00:13:01,350
that? Oh, this is, this is my house. Where are we going? We're trying to make it as easy as a

83
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:14,970
process as possible, but he's okay. It's true. All right. In the meantime, let's go back here.

84
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:24,759
I'm going to get into this fucking game. I'm not saving the replay. Why am I stealing from Otto?

85
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,039
Forget the link. He's going to play. Yeah. Forget the link. I'll click on it an hour.

86
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:45,029
Jeremy, you're going to finish Odama today. All right. Start banning people

87
00:13:45,029 --> 00:14:00,200
that say the word Odama for like four days. Shit restart. I switched polarity in the wrong,

88
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:17,899
the wrong time. What's the story of this game? You're going to ban the entire chat. Yeah, I know.

89
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:26,139
All right. Four chain. I got four chain. All right. I get it. I get it.

90
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:40,860
Mods don't care. What are you, why are you doing that? Go back to four. Oh, I see.

91
00:14:43,909 --> 00:14:49,299
I got to absorb. Okay. I have max energy right now. Who the fuck is calling me?

92
00:14:51,059 --> 00:15:38,970
What the hell? Is that a lot of stream time? Hold on. Don't, I don't want to save fucking 10% on my,

93
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:56,470
on my fucking car insurance. Okay. Jesus. God. That's a good deal though. Should I call them back?

94
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:09,240
Do I give them a, do I ring them back? I give her the, you gotta do, you gotta do polarity switching

95
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:18,360
like this. Bang. Like that. Get it again. Absorb. Oh my God. What did I do? I'm a fucking idiot.

96
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:28,629
I'm okay. I'm okay. I got full energy. How much did I use this? It's, it's all homing missiles,

97
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:38,519
by the way. All right. This part fucked me up last time. Get rid of the right, the right one.

98
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:52,490
Good. Absorb it all. Switch to other polarity. Right there. Bingo. Fuck. Oh my God. Oh my God.

99
00:16:52,490 --> 00:17:07,289
Oh my God. I'm, I'm so dead. Eat, eat, eat, eat. All right. Here's the boss. I have two health.

100
00:17:07,289 --> 00:17:17,000
I think I'll be okay. That was hard. Should I switch? I don't know. He has a black shield.

101
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:39,019
Eat the whole thing. Oh, I get it. Okay. I can. Fuck. God damn it. I get it. Yeah. Okay. Now what?

102
00:17:39,579 --> 00:17:57,349
She's, what's she switching to? Sir, are you sure? Sure. We have a one day deal. Why is today the day?

103
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:03,660
Just in case you want to take us up on our offer. 40% off the whole store. You know that Mr. Jeremy

104
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:14,170
Albertson. Fuck. I'm okay. Oh my God. All right. I'm going to throw, I'm going to, I'm going to

105
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:23,660
fucking throw my phone into the toilet in a second. I swear to God. Hey, they can't call you if your

106
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:39,380
phone's in the toilet. You know, that's thinking face. God damn it. This is fucking hard. I'm turning

107
00:18:39,380 --> 00:19:02,220
my phone on silent. He thinks this is hard. I'll get there. Wait, we're 30 minutes into the stream

108
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:09,319
we're already on phone in toilet stage. Well, no, not because of the game, because people keep

109
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:16,730
fucking calling my phone. I didn't say I want to put my computer into the toilet because that would

110
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:32,890
be sufficient if I was angry with the game. All right. Take that, take that, switch around. All

111
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:40,099
right. Let's go. Double fucking damn it. This is a phone game though. This is not, this is,

112
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:47,900
I mean, it's, it is as big. All right. Whatever. This is a hyper pay attention video game. I'm

113
00:19:47,900 --> 00:20:02,200
going to just lock in. I got max energy. I got to save this. Let's do it. You know,

114
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:20,470
you can just keep doing it. Watch that polarity shift. I gotta, I gotta become like a, like an

115
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:34,660
actual gamer here. You know what I mean? You're, it takes like a lot for your brain to understand

116
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:41,750
and process that you can, you should run into bullets. You know what I'm saying? My brain is

117
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:51,210
like, don't run into those bullets. But my, I'm like, yes, you have to. There we go. Right side.

118
00:20:53,579 --> 00:21:03,480
Wow. Same thing happened last time.

119
00:21:07,579 --> 00:21:21,619
It's okay. Just don't panic. Oh fuck. Okay. Here we go. I'm at the boss again. Just be careful.

120
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,619
Kill the things on the left and right. He's got those two orbiters.

121
00:21:29,339 --> 00:21:39,430
Do that health. Get rid of it. Good. Come on. Move, move, move, move, move. Don't get hit.

122
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:51,500
Don't be a fucking dope. God, this game's like Binding of Isaac. Okay. Shut up. Do that one.

123
00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:58,680
All right. Now what do we switch to? Oh, all right. Now they switched the polarity shifted.

124
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,920
I get it. All right. Now they're different. They're different. Oh fuck. Okay. I need to be quiet.

125
00:22:03,720 --> 00:23:02,789
Stop being like a tuber in play. Oh shit. Yeah. Got him. Got him. Did I get him?

126
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:20,940
That was actually really hard. I can, it's whatever. What are we on level two? All right.

127
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:39,269
Let's do it. Oh, they fly into you and shit now. Oh man. Damn it. Game over. All right. Do I get

128
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:57,960
started level two? Yeah. Yes, I do. Yes, I do. Because he didn't think so. I want to watch him

129
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:11,579
suffer. I'm only on level two guys. Okay. Arcade mode. Chapter two. Unnormal. This ain't chapter

130
00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:25,880
two. What the fuck? Why is this supposed to be chapter two? Arcade starts from the beginning.

131
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:34,789
Oh, all right. All right. Well, see if I can just do this. So what do I have to select? Just the

132
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:56,740
other one. This, I just have to do chapter mode. Oh, this is good practice. Good practice. I like,

133
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:14,759
I like practice. Oops. All right. That was good practice. All right. Chapter select. Please select

134
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:22,329
gateway. Chapter one. No. Chapter two. There we go. This is like, this one's called trial.

135
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:28,359
Enemies with the same polarity return fire. Yeah, that's fine. Here we go. Let's do it.

136
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:46,059
Return continues on. I could do that. Are people going to think I'm a cheater? Holy shit.

137
00:25:47,180 --> 00:26:00,740
This is fucking crazy. Take it all. Absorb the whole thing. All right. I got to switch polarity

138
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:14,779
here. I'm on the same one. Put a black. Why is he not playing afterburner? I don't know. I'm

139
00:26:14,779 --> 00:26:25,930
playing Ikaruga. This shit is so loud still. Hold on. You got to kid me right when I switched.

140
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:36,069
Fuck. That's annoying. God damn it. Fuck. That's crazy. Okay. You got to do it immediately. I got

141
00:26:36,069 --> 00:27:07,819
to turn the game down. Am I going to play at a Hulk at some point? Yes. How many chapters are there

142
00:27:07,819 --> 00:27:19,049
in the game? Oh my God. I try to get so fancy. Fuck. All right. Do it again. Call me restart

143
00:27:19,049 --> 00:27:43,220
rainy. That's fine. I don't care. The bosses are the most interesting thing to me. Jesus, man.

144
00:27:44,200 --> 00:28:03,720
Oh, fuck. It's so erratic. I should have gotten hit like five times by now. Take them out. Take

145
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:25,259
them out. Take them out. All right. What a bad place to lose the life. Use more magic. All right.

146
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:36,980
This is where it gets funky. All right. Here we go. Jesus. I have to go through them, I guess.

147
00:28:48,680 --> 00:29:03,740
Oh, man. Oh, man. What do I do? Okay. Wait, is that open? Open. Open. Open, please. Open. Oh,

148
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:33,160
man. Oh, I'm going to get crushed. Holy shit. I like cheated. How did I cheat and win? Oh, man.

149
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:40,700
Oh, it's too much. It's too much for me to do. It's too much for me to do, I think.

150
00:29:40,700 --> 00:30:07,509
This is too much for my brain to do. I get fucking hit by that. Oh, shit.

151
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:17,269
I'm going to die. I'm going to die here. This is where I die. This is how it ends for me. I'm

152
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:36,500
going to just, I'm going to explode. Okay. I have to beat a boss too. No, man. This is too much.

153
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:48,390
I need to put continues on. I got to put on continues, dude. Oh, shit. Fucking my God.

154
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,720
I can't believe I made it through that. I don't have any, I have no idea how that happened.

155
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:11,380
Okay. Weak point. What? Hit those wings? What do I have to do? Open up the fucking crevice?

156
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:38,200
I think I have to bring both of his head down. Oh, this is doing this. What does this have to do?

157
00:31:39,769 --> 00:32:07,109
What does this have to do? I can't even speak. Holy shit. That's insane. That's hard as wow.

158
00:32:07,109 --> 00:32:18,420
Okay. I'm going to turn on continues. Turn on continues. Yeah. When continues on,

159
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:29,059
replays cannot. Three continues. How many continues? How about like two continues?

160
00:32:31,269 --> 00:32:42,650
One continue. That's all you're going to let me have here is a one continue. I'll try it with one.

161
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:50,140
Look, this is an arcade game. Back in the day, I would just have to put 25 more cents in.

162
00:32:52,730 --> 00:33:01,930
By the way, Red Lemonade gave five community subs. Thank you, Red Lemonade. What's wrong?

163
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:10,650
The default setting has changed. High scores will not be saved. Wait. People want me to click

164
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:21,799
on this image very badly. Let's, okay. I'll give it to you. What is this? Why is this like,

165
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:45,819
did you, did you copy and paste a book and put it down one strip? Okay. Play. I couldn't even see

166
00:33:45,819 --> 00:33:57,690
until I zoomed in. You should take his advice. How many credits do I have? All right. That shit

167
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:10,420
is fucking hard, man. All right. Let's try this again. This is fun though. Fun, but hard. Fun,

168
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:37,739
but hard. Fuck you. I was a good start too. See how I need those continues. Just saved that.

169
00:34:41,769 --> 00:34:47,449
Damn it. And that's not even the beginning of the level. Gift a sub per continue.

170
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:57,989
Um, I'm sorry guys. It didn't cost $5 to continue in the arcade. You didn't slide

171
00:34:57,989 --> 00:35:21,260
a $5 bill into a machine. I gotta pay attention here. All right. And go, and go.

172
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,639
Same shit I did last time. Remember I was, hey, remember last time I was going,

173
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:50,489
not this time. I was, why was I looking at chat? Why was I looking at the chat? What am I doing?

174
00:35:51,289 --> 00:36:04,969
I wasn't even looking at the game. I was looking over you guys. Why am I doing that for? Start.

175
00:36:04,969 --> 00:36:18,699
What's the start button? What's the start button? What? Left click, right click, enter.

176
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:47,190
It's not enter. Mouse three. It's okay. It's middle mouse button. All right. Let's go.

177
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:54,980
You're playing with a mouse? Should I not be? Is this like playing Dark Souls with a mouse?

178
00:36:54,980 --> 00:37:05,449
Is that a bad idea? Should I not be doing this? Use a controller. What? Is this dumb?

179
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:32,070
This is dumb. Okay. I'll put my controller in. Is it dumb? Is it dumb? Wait a minute. Um,

180
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:45,610
guys, I don't think a controller can be used. Why is my Xbox controller not getting recognized?

181
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:55,400
I have my Xbox One controller plugged in. Let me try it with the controller. See if it's any

182
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:08,010
better. Use the arrow keys. How is the arrow keys different than WASD? It's the same thing. It's just

183
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:26,699
more over to the right. Let me try with the controller. All right. Here we go.

184
00:38:26,699 --> 00:38:39,820
They reached the CPU slightly faster. What? That's absolute horseshit, right? That's not real.

185
00:38:42,099 --> 00:38:48,920
No, right? Is that real? Okay. No, turn off vibration for the love of God. All right. How

186
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:56,710
do I do the... Okay. Let's do... Yeah. I don't know what the... What are the controls though?

187
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:08,489
Okay. A is fire. Flarity is B. Okay. Release power is right trigger. All right. That makes sense.

188
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:15,719
That is kind of true. How is that true? Isn't the keyboard just... I'm not going to pretend

189
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:21,619
to believe that. If you had a keyboard with a PS2 connector, it would be faster.

190
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:41,380
I don't believe a word you guys are saying right now. Uh, it's... Okay. It actually is a little

191
00:39:41,380 --> 00:40:11,690
easier. Probably a little bit. Absorb. Absorb. Is it activated? Not yet. Not yet. This is riveting

192
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:19,739
resident sleeper. Don't worry. Hey, we'll wake you up. We'll wake you up in a few hours. Have a nice

193
00:40:19,739 --> 00:40:35,019
rest. All right. Now watch out here. There we go. Fuck. There's another wave. All right. Good. Good.

194
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:52,599
Thank you. You're welcome. All right. Now we go like this. Fuck. Okay. I'm fine. Same deal. I'm

195
00:40:52,599 --> 00:41:10,519
going to go up that left side. All right. Easy. Slow down. You absorb that. Then I think it's... Is

196
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:20,090
it black? Yep. Black. Is it white again? I think so. All right. We're good. Now is where I have to

197
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:31,059
be... I got a full charge here. What the fuck? Did you see that shit come out of nowhere?

198
00:41:36,789 --> 00:41:57,030
Damn it. I just got to stay back. Fuck. God damn it. Shit. Oh, it's so... Your brain just doesn't

199
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:07,179
want to do it. It's just confused. It's like scratching your head and patting your ass.

200
00:42:07,739 --> 00:42:26,920
Whatever that saying is. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Fuck you.

201
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:52,440
All right. Here we go. I have one health. Take it all. All right. Good. All right. Let's go.

202
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:57,030
He's angry. No, I'm not. I'm frustrated. It's different. Okay. So now this one,

203
00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:03,820
you got to get the middle. You got to get right there in the center.

204
00:43:28,199 --> 00:44:09,059
Ay caramba. What's coming out first? Oh, my God. Oh, I don't get it. I don't understand. I don't

205
00:44:09,059 --> 00:44:19,829
get it. You already get it? Do they have to be out extended all the way before I can hurt it?

206
00:44:19,829 --> 00:44:42,760
Or this is hitting it, I guess. Oh, okay. So I have to fly inside. I don't understand.

207
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:54,219
You got to get in there. I got to fly inside the tubes. Oh, so what? Okay. Is that... Will

208
00:44:54,219 --> 00:45:08,809
that damage me if I'm the wrong polarity at all? All right. This time I got to be careful.

209
00:45:08,809 --> 00:45:35,659
There we go. Those homing missiles are so good. All right. I got this first part down pretty well.

210
00:45:35,659 --> 00:45:51,059
That should be good. All right. How long do you think he's going to play this game? The whole

211
00:45:51,059 --> 00:45:56,099
stream or just another hour maybe? Well, it depends on how I can even complete it or not.

212
00:45:56,099 --> 00:46:28,980
We'll find out. Fuck. I blew it. All right. Oh, shit. What the hell am I doing? Oh, interesting

213
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:35,940
to note. From every steam discussion and review of this game that I've read, most people don't

214
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:41,880
beat this level. They go, I've done it after this level two and I can't do it. Just want to make

215
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:51,769
that very clear from what I've read. It's level two, which this is level two. I don't want to

216
00:46:51,769 --> 00:47:02,119
write a steam review about it. It's fun, but I can't get past level two. Stay the fuck back.

217
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:12,340
Forget about points. Just stay alive. Oh my fucking God. What have I done? Why did I kill

218
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:37,909
that thing? I should have just left it alive. Jesus. Okay. Go this way. Right? I don't know.

219
00:47:40,710 --> 00:48:05,460
Fuck. I'm freaking out, man. Just make it. Stay away from me, please. All right. Let's go.

220
00:48:06,099 --> 00:48:29,130
I need some shit. Absorb that. All right. Come on. I want max. All right. I got pretty much max.

221
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:34,409
11 homing missiles. You got to get in there, man. All right. I know. I got to get in there,

222
00:48:34,409 --> 00:49:03,829
man. Get in there. I'll get in there. I got one shot. What am I thinking? Oh my God. Okay. Get

223
00:49:03,829 --> 00:49:45,159
in there, man. Get in there. Give me that shit. Hold on. Slow it down. Okay. Eat this. That's so

224
00:49:45,159 --> 00:49:55,800
fucking hard. Fuck. Oh, God damn it. Yeah. I thought Icaruga was a really fun game,

225
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:11,539
but unfortunately, I couldn't get past chapter two. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll

226
00:50:11,539 --> 00:50:28,789
get it. Charge. Charge it up. Restart. Restart. Restart. Hold on. Somebody gave $50. Hold on a

227
00:50:28,789 --> 00:50:36,250
second. I just got 5,000 bits right now. That's huge. I'll take a fucking explosion, a ship

228
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:45,449
explosion over that one. It's from Cab Badger. This is nice journalist gameplay. I bet you you

229
00:50:45,449 --> 00:50:52,019
couldn't beat this in 10 minutes. I bet you one fake germa sent that you couldn't beat level two

230
00:50:52,019 --> 00:51:00,250
in 10 minutes. How's that sound? Who's the real, who's the journalist here? Anyways, if you want

231
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:06,659
to play, if you want to play, play a shmup, please play Zero Ranger. The game is absurdly underrated.

232
00:51:06,659 --> 00:51:11,059
It's an excellent entry point for newcomers. While Icaruga is one of the great shmups of its time,

233
00:51:11,059 --> 00:51:16,739
it requires a whole lot of playthroughs in order to fully understand it. It's arguably harder than

234
00:51:16,739 --> 00:51:22,409
most Touhou games on arcade mode. Zero Ranger is an excellent starting point and is sure to be a

235
00:51:22,409 --> 00:51:26,809
crowd pleaser for chat. By the way, you can give yourself infinite lives in the options menu,

236
00:51:26,809 --> 00:51:36,780
which is fine. I love this. I love this comment. I love this bit message because it's fine.

237
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:44,539
That's fine. It's okay. I can do two continues. Really appreciate it. Thank you for the $50.

238
00:51:44,539 --> 00:51:53,610
Seriously, thank you for the 5,000 fucking bits. You know what? I actually really do like these

239
00:51:53,610 --> 00:52:01,289
kinds of games. I can get into them pretty easily. So you probably would see a few more of these.

240
00:52:01,289 --> 00:52:05,690
I mean, I'm bonding of Isaac's one of my favorite games. I know, I know. Yeah, everything's running

241
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:16,650
of Isaac to Gerba. But I mean, it's, it's dodging and shooting and we'll see. Let's see if I can

242
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:19,530
get through the hard one. If I can get through the hard one, then everything is, it's, it's just

243
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:25,639
like coasting at that point, right? All right. Hold on. Let me, let me, let's do that again.

244
00:52:25,639 --> 00:52:37,659
That was fucking pathetic. This is level two. Yeah. This is the one that people get stuck on.

245
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:42,250
I'm, I'm, I'm going hard. I'm, I'm going to try to beat this today.

246
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:53,050
Guys, the time to beat, if you know what you're doing, is like an hour. There's only like five

247
00:52:53,050 --> 00:53:01,940
stages in this game, but they're all just like super tricky. I almost blew that. That would have

248
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:23,210
been bad. Absorb. But I want to take, all right. Got two lives. Oak waiting room. All right. Have

249
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:30,300
you guys noticed that like, there's always apparently a waiting room for another game.

250
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:35,099
You know what I mean? It's like Ikaruga waiting room, like three days ago. Animal Crossing waiting

251
00:53:35,099 --> 00:53:39,260
room. And then I played it. Oh, Viva Pinata waiting room. And then I played, it doesn't mean

252
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:51,639
like you take a number. Oh, I can't believe it. Where's Viva Pinata? He's playing Viva Pinata

253
00:53:51,639 --> 00:53:58,679
now. Get this game out. This game sucks. Where's Ikaruga? Oh, Ikaruga. Ikaruga waiting room.

254
00:53:58,679 --> 00:54:03,539
Oh, here's Ikaruga. This game's stupid. When are you going to play Hulk? Hulk waiting room.

255
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:09,159
Oh, I'm going to play Hulk now. This game's dumb. Uh, fucking Mario 2 waiting room.

256
00:54:13,269 --> 00:54:26,730
There's not much room in the waiting room. Next level waiting room. Get out of here with that.

257
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:36,409
I'm going to beat this. It's this part right here. This is the tricky one. Just stay the

258
00:54:36,409 --> 00:55:03,820
fuck back. I just forgot how to change polarity. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, fuck. I forgot what I'm

259
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:22,980
doing. Oh, fuck. Oh, that sucks. All right. Okay. Eat him up. Eat him up. Eat him up. Eat him up.

260
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:38,860
Eat him up. And eat him up. And, and, and, and go. And then eat him up. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good.

261
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:42,139
All right. I've got, look at how much I got plenty of time. I got plenty of health.

262
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:57,289
Come on. What the fuck are you thinking? I'm so mad. I'm actually pissed off at myself right

263
00:55:57,289 --> 00:56:02,889
now. I'm fucking furious right now. I'm so furious. I am so angry. You can't even tell.

264
00:56:03,449 --> 00:56:12,300
Yes, you can. Okay. Get the, I got like fucking three lives for this shit. He's seething. I got

265
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:32,599
it. I got to beat level two. I have a question. So when I dodge like that, does it, I'll ask it

266
00:56:32,599 --> 00:57:08,619
later. Do I have a frame invincibility on that shit? Holy fuck. Come on. Fire it. Oh, you idiot.

267
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:37,130
Come on. Just give me a chance. It's firing at me. Oh my God. What happened? Oh, I hit the back.

268
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:55,929
It's okay. Oh my fucking God. I have a question. Oh my, I thought I was going to die if I went in

269
00:57:55,929 --> 00:58:11,980
there with this. I ran out of time. I don't know. I, I didn't, I thought it was a, I thought it was

270
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:15,500
like a fucking, like a beam or something. Like if I went in there, it was going to kill me.

271
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:27,960
If I was the other polarity, I figured that because I didn't know, I thought if I walked

272
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:32,170
in there, it was like, you're going to kill me. All right. Now that, that makes this way easier.

273
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:47,639
No, not easier, but you know, this game's fucking good. I like this. So those, okay. I've actually,

274
00:58:47,639 --> 00:58:52,539
a actual question. Is this considered one of the harder shoot them ups that have come out?

275
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:58,550
Is it like, just be real with me. Is that real? I want to know if I'm going up against like the

276
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:17,320
hardest. Yup. Yup. All right. Good. Good. That's how I want it. Treasure games are regarded very

277
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:23,420
difficult. Yeah. I'll get this. I'm not going to do it on hard, but you know, I'll do it with one

278
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:30,019
continue. You literally ignored 70% of chat. Well, 70, 70% of you fucking guys just making shit up.

279
00:59:31,159 --> 00:59:37,900
70% of you guys probably have never heard of this game until 12 minutes ago. So, uh, sorry.

280
00:59:37,980 --> 01:00:01,019
Excuse me. Oh no. He knows. Of course I know. Oh shit. You know. Oh my God. Why the fuck? All

281
01:00:01,019 --> 01:00:15,690
right. No more reading chat ever again. Just wasting lives for no reason. Kill, kill, kill,

282
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:27,030
swim, kill, kill, kill, swim. There are probably people that fly all around the edges here and

283
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:35,300
kill everything. I think that's not me. I gotta be careful again. Just don't fuck it up. Don't be an

284
01:00:35,300 --> 01:01:12,420
idiot. Yo. All right. This part always fucks me up. It's just, just go forward. Don't worry

285
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:24,300
about anything. Just get up there. I don't do shit. This just to go now. I'm too high strung

286
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:38,380
for this shit. I really am. I know I should be switching polarity and yeah, yeah, yeah, but

287
01:01:38,380 --> 01:02:06,170
whatever. Holy fuck. All right. Same deal. Let's go. I got it this time. I got plenty in lives,

288
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:13,480
plenty of health. I'm ready. Let's fucking go. If you think I'm going to click on a website

289
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:44,980
that's dot free in the title, you're fucking crazy. All right. Same deal. Holy fuck. You like

290
01:02:44,980 --> 01:03:29,690
that shit? You like that shit? Oops. There it is, right? No. God damn it. Please. I already

291
01:03:29,690 --> 01:03:46,340
got so good. Shit in my pants, man. Shit in my mouth. Fuck. Don't say that. I got it. I just

292
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:50,820
won. I did it. I did it. I did it. I did it. I did it. I did it. I beat level two. I beat level

293
01:03:50,820 --> 01:04:16,199
two. I don't have to write a steam review anymore. Yeah. Somebody shit in my pants. Somebody else

294
01:04:16,199 --> 01:04:26,949
like, Hey, like shit in my pants. You want me to wear your pants and then shit in them? Yeah.

295
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:39,159
Okay. And let me get this straight. All this because you're upset at a video game. Is that

296
01:04:39,159 --> 01:05:01,369
what I'm understanding here? Yes. Okay. Oh, just make sure I'm clear. Hey, what was chapter three?

297
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:33,269
Oh, shit. I have to beat it in arcade mode. Wait, what? Hold on. How was this any different than

298
01:05:33,269 --> 01:05:47,579
what I was just doing? Wait a minute. What didn't? Am I, is this correct? Stage three waiting room.

299
01:05:47,579 --> 01:05:56,309
All right. What happened? You can't unlock chapters in chapter select. Are you fucking kidding me?

300
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:21,110
So I have to go to, okay. So I have to do our arcade mode and I have to, oh man.

301
01:06:22,409 --> 01:06:30,409
Um, so I'm just gonna give myself a hundred continues. Right. So I'm going to give myself

302
01:06:30,409 --> 01:06:39,619
like five continues. I get a continue. Yeah. Um, I leveled up. I get another good. Yeah. Yeah.

303
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:48,579
Yes. Sir. Sir. Madam. I need to tell you. Yes. That's what's happening. What we're doing. Uh,

304
01:06:48,579 --> 01:07:02,730
we're going to, we're going to, uh, settings game and I'm playing one can free play. I can just do

305
01:07:02,730 --> 01:07:11,289
it in. I do not free play, right? That's, that's like, that's a joke. Um, five continues. Let's do

306
01:07:11,289 --> 01:07:21,610
free play. Who cares? No, but then I can just do it forever. That's super cheating. All right. Five

307
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:29,139
lives. Three continues. That's normal. That's normal. That's normal. That's what I'm doing.

308
01:07:29,139 --> 01:07:47,239
You need 25 lives to beat this. Just do infinite. We won't judge you. Yeah. Right. There's no way I

309
01:07:47,239 --> 01:07:53,780
don't get judged. I've already been judged. I will see that one person is going to keep me up at

310
01:07:53,780 --> 01:08:00,199
night. Uh, red lemonade, another five community subs from red lemonade. Thank you. Red lemonade

311
01:08:01,239 --> 01:08:10,570
and a 5,000 bits. Hold on. 50 bucks from Goyky. Just gave 5,000 fucking bits right now.

312
01:08:10,570 --> 01:08:14,809
Dude, I've had my quarter on the game for like an hour now. Are you done yet?

313
01:08:14,809 --> 01:08:18,729
Can you just let me goddamn play? Also, please stop talking about people shitting in your mouth.

314
01:08:18,729 --> 01:08:29,670
It's scary. I remember that you put a coin up on the cabinet and that meant that it's my turn next.

315
01:08:32,199 --> 01:08:40,600
I do remember that. But what happens when the guy comes in with like $20 in tokens and fills the

316
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:52,310
whole thing up like I just did? You have one token on there. I've put in like 40 to stay here. It

317
01:08:52,310 --> 01:08:55,750
should be a fucking walk in the park though. I mean, like, look, I know what I'm doing.

318
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:09,300
Remember when I first played this? Holy fuck. I just ate my words. Yeah, I'll get this shit.

319
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:29,130
Let's go. Look at that polarity shifting fucking expertise. Look at that fucking polarity shifting

320
01:09:29,130 --> 01:09:49,449
expertise right there. All right, do this. Let's go. Bingo. One, two, three, go.

329
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:44,409
but that's going to annoy people. Fine. This is annoying. This is annoying. This is so annoying.

342
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:46,420
while you were gone. I got lonely. So I watched grill master X BBQ instead. He turned himself

343
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:51,060
into a pickle and it was the funniest shit I've ever seen. Almost split my zero calorie monster.

344
01:18:51,699 --> 01:19:45,079
Fuck. Wait, it's not your birthday. This is so bad. I feel bad for people that want to fucking

345
01:19:45,079 --> 01:19:55,140
enjoy a video game. I feel bad for some of you that like actually now, now a majority of the stream

346
01:19:55,699 --> 01:20:02,039
is not Icaruga. You know that, right? A majority of the stream now is just look at the streamer's

347
01:20:02,039 --> 01:20:24,470
fucking mirrored face. This is no longer an Icaruga stream. Oh shit. I can't kill it.

348
01:20:25,109 --> 01:20:40,090
How do I get by that? Oh my fucking God. I'm losing it. How am I? How do I get by this? Oh shit.

349
01:20:40,729 --> 01:21:25,460
We got to slow the fuck down. Just hug the corner here. Let's go boss. That was nuts. That was the

350
01:21:25,460 --> 01:22:05,880
intro. That was the intro to chapter three. Super chain. That was totally fucking mother of what's

351
01:22:05,880 --> 01:23:40,420
it doing? What the fuck? Holy shit. The thing I've got infinite continues. Um, what? Holy,

352
01:23:40,420 --> 01:24:28,069
that's so ridiculous. That's insanity. Now with the Ferris wheel, welcome to bullet hell.

353
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:35,220
Let's go. Let's do it. Can I turn this off now? This is, have we irritated everybody enough?

354
01:24:35,220 --> 01:24:43,060
You mutton chops are coming in. I just, I shaved. What do you mean no? Nobody wants to view this.

355
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:52,460
This is like a hurts people's eyes. Look at like, I can like come in on you. What do you

01:25:14,090 --> 01:25:40,760
I've already shipped. Well, I've already shipped inbound. Oh boy. Wonder how Jim is going to get

358
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:59,340
out of this one. I'm just the fucking weirdo that just is in the corner. I'm watching the show with

359
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:09,180
you. I don't know what to look at. That's what I'm fucking saying. I know I'm taking it off.

360
01:26:09,180 --> 01:26:50,460
Imagine if you could switch polarity like crazy. Got it. Ban him. Keep it. It's fine. It's the theme

361
01:26:50,460 --> 01:27:07,659
of the game. Keep it all. We riot. All right. I'm at fucking, I'm at the pursuer. How big is the

362
01:27:07,659 --> 01:27:17,020
pixel? Anybody know how big the pixel is for this? Is it just one pixel? What should I be concerned

363
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:37,770
with? Fundamentals. Fundamentals only. Fundamentals only. Fundamentals only fundamentals. Take it all

364
01:27:37,770 --> 01:28:19,289
in and absorb, absorb, absorb, absorb, absorb, absorb, absorb and fire and fire. Whoa, that was

365
01:28:19,289 --> 01:28:41,640
intense. Oh, I can only turn one of them off. Kiss yourself. I, hold on. I can't, I, do you see what,

366
01:28:41,640 --> 01:29:29,260

367
01:29:29,260 --> 01:29:50,979
of me. Stop or I'll cry. Stop or I'll cry. Stop or I'll cry. Stop or I'll cry. Am I dressed like

368
01:29:50,979 --> 01:30:00,380
Shaggy? It's a green shirt. It's one of the primary colors. Red, green, blue, and the other ones.

369
01:30:29,220 --> 01:30:34,149
I'm just testing you. I'm just like testing you to see if you can fucking make it go like I do.

370
01:30:34,789 --> 01:30:53,430
All right. Open up. Open up now. Open up now. Open up now. Open up now. Sick. All right. We're

371
01:30:53,430 --> 01:31:03,180
going to get to chapter three with all continues and all health bars. You know, this is the first

372
01:31:03,180 --> 01:31:39,779
for me. I really thought that one was going to be the end of me. What am I? All right. What,

373
01:31:39,779 --> 01:31:45,989
why am I doing like a fucking Malcolm in the middle? Why do I keep addressing the camera?

374
01:31:49,380 --> 01:32:05,500
Why is this like my video diary right now? You're not the boss of me now. You're not

375
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:37,460
the boss of me now. And you're not so cool. Polarity shit. Polarity in my pants. What the

376
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:51,619
fuck are you saying? I mean, no. All right. Stop. We're just going for one side.

377
01:32:54,020 --> 01:33:07,640
Worth it. Switch sides. Check it out. Boom. That's how you fucking get it done. Did you see,

378
01:33:07,640 --> 01:34:00,859
did you see that shit? Fuck. Break it. Break it. Oh, my bad. I can't escape. I can't. That's my

379
01:34:00,859 --> 01:34:21,850
escape shoot. It only does one. What's, you should play Lisa the Painful. Did anybody just say that

380
01:34:21,850 --> 01:34:50,279
or am I making that up to be annoyed? Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. That's how you get it. Fucking.

381
01:34:53,079 --> 01:35:27,449
I made it. Oh, no. Putties. Everybody got that? You don't even watch Power Rangers.

382
01:35:28,579 --> 01:35:32,500
What are you? All right. I got, this is fucking me up.

383
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:58,920
No, here they come. Here they come to fire. All right. I got, I didn't do well on that one

384
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:14,840
last time. Polarity shift. Go back. Go back. Little, the little guy. All right. I got,

385
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:37,779
I got plenty of continues. I'm good. All right. Switch. Polarity. What the fuck? I hit the button

386
01:36:37,779 --> 01:38:24,810
my fat ass finger. Yo. What? Easy. Easy there. Holy shit. That guy sucks. Oh, oh, it's, it's like

387
01:38:44,819 --> 01:38:51,050
it moves fucking faster. Oh shit. It's going the other way.

388
01:39:02,819 --> 01:39:18,060
Go this way instead. Oh, my God. I'm fucking running this shit. I don't know if it continues.

389
01:39:26,579 --> 01:39:32,869
This is unfucking believable. This shit is like so fucking difficult. Like,

390
01:39:42,810 --> 01:40:03,340
fuck. I had so many fucking, all right. That's it. Delay one side. I can't. I tried it before.

391
01:40:03,340 --> 01:40:23,220
I need to get this off. This is like, I'm annoying you. I'm annoying me. Give me that chain. You're

392
01:40:23,220 --> 01:40:31,750
making it better. Give us more. There's no more room to put more. What do you mean you want more?

393
01:40:46,220 --> 01:41:09,449
I can't do more. Add a reverb. You just made me die. Why would I add a reverb? That's the, why would

394
01:41:09,449 --> 01:41:21,560
you, why do you want that? You don't want this. Nobody here actually wants me to do this. Besides,

395
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:26,840
you, you're the only person in the room when I said, who wants a reverb? And that there's 10,000

396
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:31,079
fucking people in this audience. I see one hand and I go, that's all right. Let's get it on there.

397
01:41:34,460 --> 01:41:44,939
Invert the colors. Make it for different polarities. I don't think I can do that.

398
01:41:46,329 --> 01:41:52,789
One white and one black. I don't think I can do that. I can't do like a monochrome thing.

399
01:41:55,399 --> 01:42:03,020
It's too, it won't work. Negative. That was, that's going to hurt your eyes.

400
01:42:10,279 --> 01:43:12,199
I have to, I can't. All my webcams are packed. There. Now wait. Make one delayed. I can't unless

401
01:43:12,199 --> 01:43:18,119
I have another webcam. I would, I seriously would love to do that. I really would, but I need a

402
01:43:18,119 --> 01:43:28,220
second webcam because it takes the source. I can't do it. The reason why I could do that before is

403
01:43:28,220 --> 01:43:37,750
because I had another cam. Turn one upside down. Get a set. I don't, it's, everything's packed. I

404
01:43:37,750 --> 01:43:50,710
don't have anything. I wonder if I could fuck it. Can I split this? Let me see. No, I can't. It's

405
01:43:50,710 --> 01:44:03,670
the same source. Add more. No, I can't do it. Add ambient audio effects. Oh fuck. I'm still on a

406
01:44:03,670 --> 01:44:12,390
reverb. No, not four more. No, no, no, not four more. No, no. You're getting this for a little

407
01:44:12,390 --> 01:44:45,659
while. No, not prototype mode. Backup. No, how do I get the fuck out of here? How do I, where's the,

408
01:44:45,659 --> 01:45:14,170
the fuck is happening? Here we go. No, I don't want to see the fucking credits. All right,

409
01:45:14,170 --> 01:45:22,020
here we go. Now I'm going to play. This hurts my head. I know. I blame the 15 people that said to

410
01:45:22,020 --> 01:45:35,460
do this and I'm turning it off soon. All right, let's go. The one on the left is, just doesn't

411
01:45:35,460 --> 01:45:45,829
make any sense. I changed where the thing is on the screen. I don't like that. Put it back. Where

412
01:45:45,829 --> 01:46:05,510
was it? Put that back. Was it six? Right there. Keep it. All right, this is the one. I'm going to

413
01:46:05,510 --> 01:46:10,979
get past chapter three. I really should play chapter three on its own and practice it.

414
01:46:11,699 --> 01:46:27,079
That's the correct thing to do. Yes. If I get past chapter three, then I'm going to pick chapter

415
01:46:27,079 --> 01:46:53,000
four and I'm going to practice chapter four. Choose your fighter. Select your character.

416
01:46:54,340 --> 01:46:59,779
Let me take you for a ride. I want to take you for a ride.

417
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:09,640
Now let me take you for a ride. You know, when I was younger, I, you know what I thought that they

418
01:47:09,640 --> 01:47:15,609
were saying? I thought that instead of take you for a ride, I thought they were saying,

419
01:47:15,609 --> 01:47:25,369
I want to shake you boom boom ba. I want to shake you boom boom ba. I was like fucking 13. I don't

420
01:47:25,369 --> 01:47:39,479
know. I want to shake you boom boom ba. I want to shake boom boom ba. He's literally deaf.

421
01:47:39,880 --> 01:48:04,569
You made me die. All right, just play. Molly, I want to go home. What the fuck. Polarity shift

422
01:48:04,569 --> 01:48:34,899
incoming in three, two. Activate polarity switch. Fill it up, fill it up, fill it up, fill it up,

423
01:48:34,899 --> 01:48:59,220
fill it up, fill it up. New viewer here. Does this guy always do stuff like this? Well,

424
01:48:59,220 --> 01:49:05,800
I'm one of those gamers that plays kind of whatever he feels like. I'll be live three,

425
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:44,920
four days a week. Left forever. Make two more. What do you want me to have them just all fucking

426
01:49:44,920 --> 01:49:50,920
on the side like a shitty wallpaper? You're going to crash my computer. You're going to crash. My

427
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:57,859
computer is going to crash if I do that. You don't want that. Oh my God, you do. You guys have lost

428
01:49:57,859 --> 01:50:13,850
your fucking minds. This is going to look like shit. Keep this one. I'll put them on the squares.

429
01:50:14,810 --> 01:50:23,300
God, I wish I had fucking access to like five or 10 cameras. Hold on to this because I'm going to

430
01:50:23,300 --> 01:50:31,859
get like 15 webcams and set them all up and just fucking have a brawl in my living room. I'm going

431
01:50:31,859 --> 01:50:38,260
to beat the shit out of myself with like 30 different webcams. It's going to be fucking crazy.

432
01:50:38,260 --> 01:50:44,300
They're all going to be in like random. I'm going to lose track of everything. I should,

433
01:50:44,300 --> 01:50:48,380
I should like delay some of them by like four minutes and get in like costumes and come in

434
01:50:48,380 --> 01:50:53,100
and be like, it's me, Superman. And then fucking just start, just walk off set.

435
01:50:53,899 --> 01:51:07,539
This is going to be nuts. I'm going to buy like 30 webcams. Ah, this is,

436
01:51:09,140 --> 01:51:12,819
no thanks. This is going to take like, this is going to take like 30 minutes to do this. Just this

437
01:51:14,819 --> 01:51:18,739
one man. I got it. That's, that's, I got to do that. I can't even fucking see, man.

438
01:51:19,300 --> 01:52:30,760
Is that in there? I'm going to crash OBS. Turn the brightness up. I will. It's Andy Warhol.

439
01:52:31,399 --> 01:52:35,000
This is going to be such a pain in the ass to delete every single fucking one of these

440
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:43,640
in a little bit. We're going to have so much fun with the 30 webcams stream.

441
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:48,869
I'm going to do that sooner than you think. In fact, I'm just going to fucking order them like

442
01:52:48,869 --> 01:52:58,359
today. We're going to have like a bunch of different scenarios that I was going to play out.

443
01:52:59,399 --> 01:53:05,449
It'll be a lot of fun. That, how much, okay, hold on a minute. How much is a webcam?

444
01:53:06,409 --> 01:53:12,739
All right. This is, you're talking, this is a real investment. A decent webcam is like 60 or 70 bucks.

445
01:53:14,020 --> 01:53:22,380
I can do like full HD 60 FPS. It's like $60. So this is going to be thousands of dollars.

446
01:53:22,939 --> 01:53:29,289
Just get really garbage ones. Yep. They won't, they might not be able to even get pulled through.

447
01:53:30,649 --> 01:53:34,810
What? Okay. I get, do you want me to get a bunch of $30 webcams? What am I going to do with these

448
01:53:34,810 --> 01:53:44,899
when I'm done? What am I going to do with them? Just get wicked shitty ones. Give them away.

449
01:53:45,460 --> 01:54:07,500
I'm not going to give away 30 webcams. All right. That's good. Oh, whoa. They're all swimming

450
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:50,779
together. Okay. Let's change this. What's going on? Why is it doing this? This thing is broken.

451
01:54:50,779 --> 01:55:23,140
There we go. Wow. Hey, chat. How many fingers am I holding up? That's fucking terrifying. All right.

452
01:55:23,140 --> 01:55:50,100
Let's go. Icaruga. Some said it's one of the hardest games ever made. Some say Icaruga.

453
01:55:50,979 --> 01:56:02,899
Some say it's one of the hardest games ever. 12 more in the little slots in the bottom left.

454
01:56:02,899 --> 01:56:08,949
No, you guys need to be able to see when I have power. I just invited my friend to this stream.

455
01:56:08,949 --> 01:56:28,550
He left. Oh, his loss. Hey, let me guess. Uh, when he left and he was like, fuck that stream,

456
01:56:28,550 --> 01:56:37,369
you were like, yeah, man, down the Twitch rabbit hole. You find all kinds of fucking characters

457
01:56:37,369 --> 01:56:56,819
on a down Twitch rabbit hole. I'm leaving. Stay. Why? What would you leave for? I'm playing

458
01:56:56,819 --> 01:57:12,810
Icaruga. Some say hardest fucking game ever. This is my first stream. What's up, dude? Welcome to the...

459
01:57:14,250 --> 01:57:22,520
What are we calling ourselves now? What are we calling ourselves now? The... I don't know.

460
01:57:22,520 --> 01:57:30,899
There's too many groups. There's like the Moo crew, the Drew crew. What's the Jerma crew?

461
01:57:31,460 --> 01:58:02,550
Do I have one? I don't think I even have one. Do I? Is anybody listening to me? The Jerms. No,

462
01:58:02,550 --> 01:58:26,470
that's like 2012. How about the wicked sloppy eaters? That kind of rolls off the tongue. Kind

463
01:58:26,470 --> 01:58:48,279
of cool. Bingo. Bingo. Oh, yeah. Welcome to the stream, guys. Hey, it's us. You know that this

464
01:58:48,279 --> 01:58:54,359
group. Hey, you just you just followed for the first time. Welcome to the We Put Too Much

465
01:58:54,359 --> 01:59:27,159
Fucking Ketchup on All of Our Food crew. We love that shit here. Oh, you fucking idiot.

466
01:59:31,880 --> 01:59:40,409
You just bumped me. No, you bumped me. I was coming out of the fucking spot and you didn't stop for me.

467
01:59:40,409 --> 01:59:48,069
You can slow down. What's your fucking insurance? Unbelievable. Pay fucking attention.

468
01:59:49,689 --> 02:00:18,840
And notice you didn't put your cart back either. Dick. I can't. Oh, I can't wait to like chug a water.

469
02:00:19,399 --> 02:00:22,920
I'm going to drink like I'm going to. OK, I'm going to like chug a water at some point during

470
02:00:22,920 --> 02:00:27,399
the 30 webcam stream. And at some point, like 10 minutes after I start streaming, one of them is

471
02:00:27,399 --> 02:00:51,819
going to slam the water. One of them. Multiply my mic channel. No, we'll save it. What are you

472
02:00:51,819 --> 02:01:01,399
doing? Don't switch. What are you doing? All right. Itchy face. Medicine, Max. Max about medicine.

473
02:01:02,119 --> 02:01:44,149
Skip everything quick. What the fuck are you doing? I'm fucking crazy, I think.

474
02:01:45,109 --> 02:02:00,939
What happened to you in the last few days? Well, I'm packing boxes and moving and it's making me

475
02:02:00,939 --> 02:02:08,420
crazy. No, I've been actually been I've been OK. It's been fun. I've had a good time on these

476
02:02:08,420 --> 02:02:26,739
streams. That's what I love. I love. Great. All right, let's get this done. I got three.

477
02:02:35,899 --> 02:02:38,859
What the fuck even hit me? Game is not even programmed correctly.

478
02:02:58,140 --> 02:03:11,770
I do sound like a fucking psycho, huh? I'm just having fun, man. Oh, my. All right. He comes.

479
02:03:11,770 --> 02:03:19,000
Watch out. I thought he went through. God damn it. When does he blast through? Right now, right?

480
02:03:20,310 --> 02:03:51,670
Jesus. He's shitting me. Dude, fuck this guy. Dude, this guy's a fucking pain in the ass.

481
02:03:52,229 --> 02:05:49,300
All right. How many continues do I have? Two. All right. Let's try to not fuck this up. One. What

482
02:05:49,300 --> 02:06:08,699
the fuck? Where's the last one? Where's the last one? Where's the last one? Oh, up in smoke.

483
02:06:09,260 --> 02:06:21,800
Clap. It only took cheating. This is level four. Time to turn up the difficulty.

484
02:06:25,619 --> 02:06:42,340
Mm hmm. Can I absorb those? I guess. All right. That's what it's about. Reality is unveiled.

485
02:06:42,340 --> 02:06:50,180
And what did it want? You have noisy eyelashes. You know, I actually can hear my eyelashes when

486
02:06:50,180 --> 02:07:04,060
I sleep. It's like, I mean, that that person's that person's a sicko, but you know, whatever.

487
02:07:20,300 --> 02:07:35,739
Oh, yeah. Yeah. This is insanity. What happened to one of the Germans? I'm I want to practice

488
02:07:35,739 --> 02:07:52,199
chapter four. I got an achievement. One of them has to go. Oh, right. OK. See you later, dude.

489
02:07:52,199 --> 02:08:01,100
No, no, no. Wait, wait. I have to confirm. Everybody fucking everybody point and laugh at

490
02:08:01,100 --> 02:08:19,699
this guy. See you. You're leaving. Ha ha ha ha. I'm not going to multiply the mics. All right.

491
02:08:19,699 --> 02:08:33,239
Let's I want to get I got to get a good feel for it after four takes practice. Practice makes

492
02:08:33,239 --> 02:08:42,819
perfect. You know, I'm just going to feel for it. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing right now,

493
02:08:42,819 --> 02:09:02,699
but it's not a good. It's not working. One to two left. Bilateral religion of the five hundred

494
02:09:02,699 --> 02:09:11,060
fucking fifty. Whatever it is, it's fifty dollars. Five thousand bits from phylactery phylactery

495
02:09:11,060 --> 02:09:17,079
says by the webcam slave. This is pleasing to chat. I'm going to get them. Well, I'm going to

496
02:09:17,079 --> 02:09:27,770
do that as soon as I can. This is this is absurd. I have to stay on one polarity. I can't change.

497
02:09:32,979 --> 02:09:51,460
And then they start coming in. Holy fuck. Lord, use the shields to your advantage.

498
02:09:51,460 --> 02:10:08,180
Well, I I'm kind of itchy head right now. Hold on. This game was designed to take

499
02:10:08,180 --> 02:10:36,949
fifty dollars from each person that wanted to try to play. Where's the safe place to stand here?

500
02:10:52,140 --> 02:11:46,939
Hope I get back here with ten fucking continues. That is of course not. Holy shit.

501
02:11:47,180 --> 02:12:02,260
Come on, stinky. This is a baby game. Multiply mics. I can't do that. Oh, my God. You're killing me.

502
02:12:02,739 --> 02:12:36,300
How many are there? What is that? What was that? What was that? I don't even know what it was.

503
02:12:36,859 --> 02:12:46,819
What happened? What was that? Was the game audio? Why is the game audio coming through?

504
02:12:47,859 --> 02:13:16,710
This is all fucked up because of because of the mixer. How about this? That change anything? No,

505
02:13:16,710 --> 02:13:30,199
that change anything? No, that's fucked up. I can't do it. Just add a chorus.

506
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:37,539
Might as well just do this. This is potential best joke in 2020. I would hold on to that

507
02:13:37,539 --> 02:13:44,819
because it's going to be thirty fucking webcams attached here. We this this joke is going to be

508
02:13:44,819 --> 02:13:54,760
is going to absolutely run its entire course. I can't do it. It won't work. I got this fucking

509
02:13:54,760 --> 02:14:00,810
mixer. It's all screwed up. Twenty nine and I'll be furious. All right, let me try to figure out

510
02:14:00,810 --> 02:14:06,470
this fucking chapter four. We have thirty USB ports. I'll just get a I'll get a extension.

511
02:14:08,039 --> 02:14:16,090
Hopefully, I have to be careful because if I have a USB extender with like an extra ten,

512
02:14:20,340 --> 02:14:26,859
right, you know what I'm saying? Like, would that work? I need enough like bus spots, right?

513
02:14:26,859 --> 02:15:38,579
Whatever they're called needs to be an active extension. Oh, man. Try just not fire at all.

514
02:15:38,979 --> 02:15:43,300
The wall. Yeah, but they come down this wall. They they behind the wall. They still fly in.

515
02:15:44,100 --> 02:16:10,460
I was doing a thousand continues. I don't care. I'm literally going to put on 99 continues.

516
02:16:10,460 --> 02:16:18,100
You call me a cheater if you want to. This is fucking crazy. They've already taken like

517
02:16:18,100 --> 02:16:23,750
thirty dollars of my tokens at this point. Can I sit back here? What if I just hold on? What if

518
02:16:23,750 --> 02:16:32,409
I just sit back here? Wait, hold on. I probably should only go. I'm going to only shoot for the.

519
02:16:33,590 --> 02:16:39,270
I don't know. This is fucking outrageous. Left. Jeremiah could have done this.

520
02:16:41,049 --> 02:16:48,040
Fuck, man. This is so fucking crazy. Left, right, left, right, left, right while switching polarity

521
02:16:48,760 --> 02:16:56,280
like right, right, left, left, right, right, left, left, right, right, left, left, right,

522
02:16:56,280 --> 02:17:15,219
right, left, left, right, right, left, fuck, right, left. This is a five hundred dollar game.

523
02:17:15,940 --> 02:17:18,420
Like you've got to spend you've got to spend five hundred dollars to beat this.

524
02:17:31,780 --> 02:17:35,299
This is one of those scenarios where the guy you know when you went to the arcade and you would get

525
02:17:35,940 --> 02:17:40,059
the cup because it didn't fit in your pocket. How many tokens you got?

526
02:17:40,780 --> 02:17:46,899
There's somebody with a big fucking big gulp cup sitting on top of this desk onto on the cabinet.

527
02:17:47,860 --> 02:17:57,059
And they're just like if the thing weighs like fucking three and a half pounds like that,

528
02:17:58,020 --> 02:18:01,780
it's a big unit and it's probably has like two or three hundred tokens in it.

529
02:18:05,930 --> 02:18:09,610
Call me cheater if you want. I just want to see the I want to see the boss. Call me cheater. I don't care.

530
02:18:09,610 --> 02:18:43,989
Remember there's a line of people behind you and they're all small but look at them.

531
02:18:46,389 --> 02:19:03,350
Let's exit the game. What just happened? All right, let's go. It's time. Chapter four. Chapter select.

532
02:19:03,350 --> 02:19:11,989
I'm beating this shit even if I have to fucking use powers. Wait, I should do arcade mode then,

533
02:19:11,989 --> 02:19:25,209
right? Somebody said your five eight lol. Yeah and somewhere like fucking 700 million people on the

534
02:19:25,209 --> 02:19:36,569
planet. Oh wow. Oh I can't believe he's five eight. That's like the same size of like a billion people.

535
02:19:37,530 --> 02:19:54,790
Why does he so sound so what? Tom Cruise is fucking five seven.

536
02:19:55,350 --> 02:20:13,399
All in him and that motherfucker like saves the world. But what I'm talking about in his movies.

537
02:20:13,399 --> 02:20:32,280
What? I can't. They make him stand on boxes. Energy Max. This is pretty good. This is pretty

538
02:20:32,280 --> 02:20:36,760
significant play in this game. Doesn't matter. I have infinite lives. We're just going to beat

539
02:20:36,760 --> 02:20:57,930
the fucking game right now. Doesn't count. That's okay. Whatever. Whatever. This game is pretty cool

540
02:20:57,930 --> 02:21:29,059
though. This game is really good. How is it not dead? Play with 99 lives instead of infinite

541
02:21:29,059 --> 02:21:34,680
continues. I think I went right past that boat. I just I want to see the bosses and stuff. Look,

542
02:21:34,680 --> 02:21:49,030
I'm playing on like story mode. Play Mario Paint. Is that game good? Is that like the Looney Tunes

543
02:21:49,030 --> 02:22:22,329
one for Super Nintendo? Come on. Come on. Kick up Luka. Energy Max. Energy Max. Energy Max.

544
02:22:24,760 --> 02:22:50,229
My grandma can play this game better than you. Oh yeah? Challenging. Rewarding.

545
02:22:58,709 --> 02:23:11,159
Why is this stream under puzzle category? What? What? This is under. Why is it under puzzle?

546
02:23:15,180 --> 02:23:23,450
English puzzle shoot them up. I didn't do that. Oh that's another thing we can do.

547
02:23:24,010 --> 02:23:28,649
Okay so I'm gonna write this down. On the 30 webcam stream we're gonna do a

548
02:23:28,649 --> 02:23:34,790
German jigsaw puzzle with my whole body. I'm gonna like just stand and we're gonna try to

549
02:23:34,790 --> 02:23:40,360
put me together. Sounds fun. All right well by the way we're doing this in like we're doing this in

550
02:23:40,360 --> 02:23:45,819
like less than five days. You understand? This is happening like within the next week. I fucking

551
02:23:45,819 --> 02:23:51,020
promise. We're doing this like this like probably next weekend. I swear to god this is too interesting

552
02:23:51,020 --> 02:24:04,540
for me. Don't give me hope. No there's no way that doesn't happen. If I can connect I might need

553
02:24:04,540 --> 02:24:11,739
another computer right? I might need to get another computer like a laptop which also has like seven

554
02:24:11,739 --> 02:24:19,659
or eight USB buses. Feed that video through and control them. Like I'm gonna need like probably

555
02:24:19,659 --> 02:24:31,819
three computers right? Laptop with eight. What happened? Why did I leave the game for?

556
02:24:32,459 --> 02:24:47,860
What just happened? What just happened? Why did that just kick me out?

557
02:24:50,680 --> 02:25:06,520
I lost? Like no I didn't. It was on chapter select? No it was not. Is it goes on free play?

558
02:25:07,799 --> 02:25:19,350
It was? No well fuck I can't believe it. No it wasn't. You sure it was? Fuck. One player game arcade.

559
02:25:23,420 --> 02:25:37,350
Arcade. It was on it. Arcade normal. German forgot his homework. He didn't tell us why he never was

560
02:25:37,350 --> 02:25:40,950
gonna play Lisa. I just well I told you yesterday because I don't want to.

561
02:25:41,909 --> 02:25:54,379
What? Didn't I say I don't want to play? I'm not playing Odama right now. I gotta figure out how

562
02:25:54,379 --> 02:26:01,620
I'm gonna do this webcam thing. Does anybody know realistically how many actual video devices you

563
02:26:01,620 --> 02:26:07,450
can pull through something like OBS without having a separate computer? Hold that like that speed.

564
02:26:08,409 --> 02:26:13,100
What is it like four or five? At least and it's at least two. It's probably it's probably like five

565
02:26:13,100 --> 02:26:41,989
or six. 12? OBS allows at least Odama. Fucking god. Kill the big one on the left and then the big

566
02:26:41,989 --> 02:26:46,229
one on the right. Did you check the toilets on the left? Did you check the toilets on the right? Did

567
02:26:46,229 --> 02:26:48,709
you check toilets on the left? Did you check toilets on the right? Did you check toilets on the left?

568
02:26:48,709 --> 02:26:51,110
Did you check toilets on the right? Did you check toilets on the left? Did you check the toilets on

569
02:26:51,110 --> 02:27:11,239
the right? He's on crack. He's on crack. He's on crack. He's on crack. He's on crack. No he's not.

570
02:27:11,639 --> 02:27:36,100
He's on crack. He's on crack. He's on crack. Okay stop.

571
02:27:40,700 --> 02:28:11,110
Boring. Boring. Boring. Hair flip. Boring. Boring. Boring. Shut up. All right shut up. Kill

572
02:28:11,110 --> 02:28:24,979
that one. What do you think I'm doing? I'm killing. We want blood. We want explosives. We want blood.

573
02:28:24,979 --> 02:28:56,639
This is why the webcams never on you guys understand you get it now you actually get it

574
02:28:57,180 --> 02:29:08,319
All right. So why am I not going to chapter two?

575
02:29:09,079 --> 02:29:16,860
This is fucking me up. I thought it's because of nudity. Well, it's both. It's because of both

576
02:29:17,459 --> 02:29:22,469
Okay, boss battle bonus. I did it score axe chain grade C

577
02:29:23,350 --> 02:29:29,899
Moving on to chapter two. I don't what the fuck was that? That was weird. All right, let's do let's beat this whole damn game

578
02:29:30,620 --> 02:30:04,229
Okay double, please. Stop swearing. Please stop. All right, I won't

579
02:30:04,829 --> 02:30:09,670
You hear me swear one more time. I will give one community sub before every

580
02:30:10,829 --> 02:30:12,829
FUCK you hear okay

581
02:30:16,379 --> 02:30:17,860

Only for today by the way. Oh

02:30:27,459 --> 02:30:35,819
Only today only today today only for the next five straight minutes

584
02:30:36,860 --> 02:30:57,620
Come on say it fun. I am having fun

585
02:31:10,649 --> 02:31:19,219
And now he's having fun. I heard a I heard is I heard of rumor over there and typically I would say the upward

586
02:31:19,819 --> 02:31:36,409
Not today though

587
02:31:36,409 --> 02:31:37,530

588
02:31:37,530 --> 02:32:05,350
Whoops, got it. Got it. Eat them all eat them all eat them all eat them all eat them all

589
02:32:11,799 --> 02:32:28,940
When is he eating the shoe I'm not eating the shoe. All right, I'm not eating the shoe

590
02:32:34,229 --> 02:32:44,540
Pardon to the mic

591
02:32:47,959 --> 02:32:55,510
No, all right. Let's do this one

592
02:32:58,059 --> 02:33:01,100
Why did I read that? I don't know. It's chats going real fast. I'm reading random shit

593
02:33:26,260 --> 02:33:51,420
What the fuck man?

594
02:33:51,500 --> 02:34:04,600
Whoa, I got the whole thing. Oh, whoops. That's a sub. That's one I

595
02:34:05,399 --> 02:34:06,680
I

596
02:34:06,680 --> 02:34:16,809
Completely forgot we were doing that. I don't I completely forgot. That's one. All right, you get one

597
02:34:18,090 --> 02:34:20,409
I'll I'll I'll pay up at the end of the screen

598
02:34:20,809 --> 02:34:25,540
Just give me to the end of the screen. Just give me to the end of the screen and i'll get you

599
02:34:40,950 --> 02:34:42,950
I already have a sub. I want another one

600
02:34:43,959 --> 02:34:45,559
greedy

601
02:34:45,559 --> 02:34:52,739
Greedy

602
02:34:52,739 --> 02:34:55,819
Give me another one. I greedy

603
02:34:55,819 --> 02:34:57,819
All right. I'm just like fucking

604
02:34:57,979 --> 02:35:22,569
That's two

605
02:35:22,569 --> 02:35:26,280
Is there speed runs of this game? Do they run this that stuff like um

606
02:35:27,219 --> 02:35:31,079
HDq or anything? I feel like this would be crazy to watch somebody do this and not get hit

607
02:35:31,799 --> 02:35:42,409
The speed runs for every game

608
02:35:42,409 --> 02:35:44,409
It might be inaccurate that might not be accurate

609
02:35:50,340 --> 02:35:52,200
I'm, not sure that's accurate

610
02:35:52,200 --> 02:35:54,200
It's something that nobody's speed run before

611
02:35:55,370 --> 02:35:56,329
Right

612
02:35:56,329 --> 02:36:28,440
All right. Let's go

613
02:36:28,440 --> 02:36:30,440
I got funky

614
02:36:31,350 --> 02:36:45,049
Oh, I didn't say I said funky

615
02:36:45,049 --> 02:36:47,209
So I ran out of quarters and what I ended up doing

616
02:36:47,930 --> 02:36:53,510
Is I um, I opened up the machine the front of the machine where the coins go

617
02:36:54,540 --> 02:36:59,829
And there's that little tab that registers the coins and I got in there and went

618
02:37:01,350 --> 02:37:09,159
And then I closed it up

619
02:37:09,239 --> 02:37:17,780
That's illegal. Not if you own the arcade. It's not

620
02:37:19,139 --> 02:37:21,139
Not if it's my place

621
02:37:22,170 --> 02:37:25,530
After hours the business is closed. I want to play Icaruga until I win

622
02:37:29,940 --> 02:37:34,709
I mean illegal

623
02:37:34,709 --> 02:37:38,549
Hold on. It's illegal for me to open up an arcade cabinet that I own

624
02:37:39,190 --> 02:37:41,190
after hours and

625
02:37:41,190 --> 02:37:43,510
Jiggle the coin thing to get a hundred lives

626
02:37:45,620 --> 02:37:47,219
No, it's not

627
02:37:47,219 --> 02:37:49,219
I own the machine

628
02:37:57,049 --> 02:38:04,280
I own the machine

629
02:38:04,280 --> 02:38:06,280
Machine owns you what?

630
02:38:17,700 --> 02:38:19,379
Now that okay

631
02:38:19,379 --> 02:38:23,219
Doesn't matter

632
02:38:23,219 --> 02:38:27,379
Okay, i'm just playing so sloppy now because when you know that you believe there's nothing to fear

633
02:38:27,700 --> 02:38:32,180
I just like i'm like whatever I can just die a bunch of times. I own the fucking arcade

634
02:38:33,530 --> 02:38:35,530
This game is kind of hard

635
02:38:39,690 --> 02:38:51,850
All right play for real. Let's go

636
02:38:51,850 --> 02:38:53,850
I mean, this is fucking hard as shit. It is

637
02:39:02,040 --> 02:39:03,260
jeez

638
02:39:03,260 --> 02:39:05,260
Give it up for four

639
02:39:07,270 --> 02:39:08,549
For what?

640
02:39:08,549 --> 02:39:10,389
Oh four subs

641
02:39:10,389 --> 02:39:24,790
I mean, that's the technique

642
02:39:24,790 --> 02:39:34,139
Got it. Where's the blood? This game sucks

643
02:39:45,020 --> 02:40:08,340
Look at me times 20 shit shit these schmups. I swear these schmups are so difficult

644
02:40:12,340 --> 02:40:14,340
Replay by the way omega low

645
02:40:15,180 --> 02:40:16,219
Oh

646
02:40:16,219 --> 02:40:41,020
Schmup. Hey you shut the schmup up. He's learning. He's learning

647
02:40:41,739 --> 02:40:43,739
God, finally, he's learning

648
02:40:44,379 --> 02:40:48,100
All right. I gotta slow down. I'm freaking some of you out right now

649
02:41:00,940 --> 02:41:10,340
God my doesn't want to go. It's just coin. It's just coin stealing

650
02:41:11,299 --> 02:41:18,090
This is stealing coins at this point

651
02:41:35,110 --> 02:41:37,110
What even fucking hit me five

652
02:41:47,750 --> 02:41:50,309
Oh my god, this is this is crazy

653
02:41:51,110 --> 02:41:55,030
I feel like this is the part of the game where like if you speed run the game and you get hit once it's over

654
02:41:55,510 --> 02:41:57,510
You hate this part

655
02:41:57,829 --> 02:42:02,069
You probably you probably sit there and go this is the worst thing. I just gotta make sure I don't get hit

656
02:42:02,149 --> 02:42:04,149
I gotta be careful. This is the worst one

657
02:42:05,110 --> 02:42:16,329
This is easy when you know, yeah, I guess when you know, you just know right

658
02:42:17,370 --> 02:42:20,649
But this part in particular is freaking me out. Should I follow the beams?

659
02:42:21,610 --> 02:42:26,309
I mean, I guess this is kind of sort of

660
02:42:27,510 --> 02:42:34,180
It's just too many colors on the screen. My brain can't look at it

661
02:42:40,920 --> 02:42:42,920
It's it's too many colors

662
02:42:43,940 --> 02:42:50,969
They're just fool. It's I feel like i'm playing like guitar hero 12 times in a row like on five different screens

663
02:42:52,299 --> 02:42:53,340
and

664
02:42:53,340 --> 02:43:10,229
Five different songs

665
02:43:10,229 --> 02:43:12,549
Give us a good reason why you don't want to play lisa

666
02:43:16,569 --> 02:43:37,750
Because I said so okay mom

667
02:43:38,549 --> 02:43:49,860
This is it. This is what we separate the gamers from the

668
02:43:51,370 --> 02:43:58,729
Whatever. I don't know

669
02:43:59,610 --> 02:44:04,760
Hard game

670
02:44:04,760 --> 02:44:09,159
I feel bad for that guy that wrote that steam review that doesn't realize you can put it on free play mode

671
02:44:09,479 --> 02:44:12,360
I feel you man. You and I are you and I are in this together

672
02:44:18,979 --> 02:44:28,260
What geez?

673
02:44:28,260 --> 02:44:31,379
Okay, it's just don't move but it's you have to

674
02:44:36,090 --> 02:44:38,090
I only have 13 seconds left

675
02:44:40,440 --> 02:45:00,899
I'm gonna die from time

676
02:45:00,899 --> 02:45:03,299
Uh, did that come back? Is that do I get more time?

677
02:45:04,100 --> 02:45:09,209
Or what what happens here? Is that gonna start the countdown at three seconds right now?

678
02:45:10,010 --> 02:45:17,780
No, it's not right. It's like a timed mission

679
02:45:18,420 --> 02:45:20,440
All right. Here we go

680
02:45:20,440 --> 02:45:35,590
Okay. Oh man

681
02:45:39,260 --> 02:45:40,860
This is fucking

682
02:45:40,860 --> 02:45:42,860
This is ridiculous

683
02:45:49,180 --> 02:45:52,620
You have to you have to move you have to move

684
02:46:05,700 --> 02:46:24,020
Dude, I can't even switch polarities in time. I'm gonna run out of time

685
02:46:51,989 --> 02:46:53,989
Yo, kill him kill him. I have 10 seconds

686
02:47:12,469 --> 02:47:28,069
Lame what do you mean lame? That was pog. Didn't I say I was gonna go pee like two hours ago? I did right?

687
02:47:32,620 --> 02:47:35,879
You're a cheater

688
02:47:35,879 --> 02:47:38,680
Call me whatever you want. I'm a winner in my book

689
02:47:44,360 --> 02:47:46,360
That's a big chain 20 chain

690
02:47:51,020 --> 02:48:19,079
Oh

691
02:48:19,079 --> 02:48:21,079
Oh big boy

692
02:48:37,030 --> 02:48:39,190
Would you play dark souls 3 with infinite health?

693
02:48:40,739 --> 02:48:42,739
Not even a fair comparison

694
02:48:46,040 --> 02:48:50,760
I make you alive so that you can walk along the right way, but you can't understand it. What is this the brain?

695
02:48:51,319 --> 02:49:06,870
Right in the middle if you play dark souls with infinite health

696
02:49:08,170 --> 02:49:10,709
No, I wouldn't but that that that that's

697
02:49:12,309 --> 02:49:34,979
You're wrong. Damn. Okay. I guess i'm wrong then

698
02:49:38,549 --> 02:49:41,350
You can't feel the visible things. How can you feel the invisible things?

699
02:49:41,829 --> 02:49:57,719
This is pretty sick. Wait, let him grab me. Oh, no, this shit is fucking wacky

700
02:49:58,979 --> 02:50:06,760
That's wacky

701
02:50:06,760 --> 02:50:11,299
You gotta that's

702
02:50:11,379 --> 02:50:16,500
Wacky, man. Oh, there's no way you beat this normally unless you put in 500 bucks

703
02:50:16,899 --> 02:50:20,659
There's no way you do this normally without five hundred dollars

704
02:50:50,200 --> 02:50:53,190
Don't cap that

705
02:50:53,190 --> 02:50:56,389
It's impossible to cut off this metamorphosis forever. Can you see can't you?

706
02:50:57,110 --> 02:51:32,149
Do I have to destroy something?

707
02:51:32,149 --> 02:51:38,500
Holy shit absorb absorb fire

708
02:51:39,430 --> 02:51:47,430
Absorb fire. I

709
02:52:19,700 --> 02:52:35,989
That sure was a tricky one. Let's see how germ affairs are the next game. That was a disgusting empty win

710
02:52:39,049 --> 02:52:43,450
Oh, that's not it. That's not it match. Um, can you imagine if I had gotten here and beat wow good thing

711
02:52:43,450 --> 02:52:44,729
We didn't do that

712
02:52:44,729 --> 02:52:47,290
Can you imagine if I had gotten here and just didn't do this?

713
02:52:53,829 --> 02:53:01,620
Uh, what am I supposed to do?

714
02:53:11,829 --> 02:53:13,829
You want to absorb for points

715
02:53:20,950 --> 02:53:41,780
I gotta get at least four million zero

716
02:53:42,579 --> 02:53:45,450
remain bonus plus five hundred thousand

717
02:53:46,850 --> 02:53:49,510
four point seven eight five million points

718
02:53:50,229 --> 02:53:55,420
He keeps forgetting basic mechanics. Um, no, i'm i'm not it's just

719
02:53:56,219 --> 02:53:58,219
Lights are filling every inch of the screen

720
02:53:58,940 --> 02:54:09,129
This is a hollow victory

721
02:54:09,129 --> 02:54:10,569
Maybe for you

722
02:54:10,569 --> 02:54:12,739
Not for me

723
02:54:12,739 --> 02:54:14,739
Is this what we wished for?

724
02:54:17,180 --> 02:54:22,780
Don't worry, we will understand each other someday and the life is succeeded into a distant future. What the fuck is happening

725
02:54:24,120 --> 02:54:26,120
There was like some kind of story here

726
02:54:31,829 --> 02:54:33,340
Ikaruga

727
02:54:33,340 --> 02:54:35,319
That was fucking fun

728
02:54:35,319 --> 02:54:37,559
Hey, I beat the first three levels without cheating

729
02:54:38,120 --> 02:54:41,639
That's a

730
02:54:41,639 --> 02:54:45,479
Hey, if i'm allowed to if I take up 66 percent of the screen

731
02:54:46,729 --> 02:54:49,290
I'm allowed to cheat for 66 percent of the game

732
02:54:50,709 --> 02:54:53,270
Because the 66 percent of the game of the stream has been me

733
02:54:53,989 --> 02:54:57,909
I'll be right back. I gotta pee

734
02:57:40,659 --> 02:57:44,620
Okay, so i'm gonna make you all real sad right now

735
02:57:47,450 --> 02:57:50,409
Well, hi, i'm gonna make you all real sad

736
02:57:53,079 --> 02:57:53,879
I've

737
02:57:53,879 --> 02:58:02,299
I've got a lot of shit to do and I gotta stop. Sorry. These last few streams have been like three to four hours

738
02:58:02,379 --> 02:58:03,659
But they have to be

739
02:58:03,659 --> 02:58:05,319
i'm sorry

740
02:58:05,319 --> 02:58:11,540
That's the way it is. But I will tell you i'm going to work on something very very important

741
02:58:12,469 --> 02:58:14,329
When I get back

742
02:58:14,329 --> 02:58:16,969
Now I know you're not gonna want to hear this either and I don't want to say this either

743
02:58:16,969 --> 02:58:19,530
But like I have to there's so many things I have to do and i'm sorry

744
02:58:21,129 --> 02:58:28,569
I have to you have i'm gonna have to do another small leave of absence here another couple of days

745
02:58:28,889 --> 02:58:31,690
Another two or three days and then we'll hopefully be back to normal

746
02:58:32,250 --> 02:58:36,649
I'm sorry. I know i'm sorry. I know I know I know I know I know I was just gone for like five days

747
02:58:37,049 --> 02:58:44,020
And this we just did three here and they're shorter. I know I trust me. I know I want to stay but

748
02:58:45,780 --> 02:58:48,739
I forgot i'm like over here. I'm like leaning it but

749
02:58:52,090 --> 02:58:56,500
Wink to make up for it

750
02:58:56,500 --> 02:58:58,040
I

751
02:58:58,040 --> 02:59:00,379
Here's what you can look forward to

752
02:59:00,379 --> 02:59:05,579
The next stream was a calendar when I come back

753
02:59:06,219 --> 02:59:10,020
You ready for this?

754
02:59:10,020 --> 02:59:13,239
Are you ready to hear this?

755
02:59:13,239 --> 02:59:14,920
the next stream

756
02:59:14,920 --> 02:59:17,399
Will be on thursday or friday probably friday

757
02:59:18,629 --> 02:59:23,590
And I am going to do whatever I can to make it possible to do the webcam stream on friday

758
02:59:27,190 --> 02:59:29,190
And then saturday and possibly sunday

759
02:59:29,850 --> 02:59:31,370
hulk ultimate destruction

760
02:59:31,370 --> 02:59:39,909
That's the plan for this weekend

761
02:59:39,909 --> 02:59:50,409
Finally hulk ultimate destruction waiting room. There you go. If I can get that i'm so interested in that webcam stream

762
02:59:51,420 --> 02:59:54,280
So like not only am I going to go do a bunch of other shit

763
02:59:54,680 --> 03:00:00,360
But i'm going to do a ton of research into how I can get like at least 10 to 15 webcams pointed at me and captured

764
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:06,780
But with that I am you're going to see here we go. We're going to disappear here

765
03:00:07,579 --> 03:00:08,940
Who's going to be left?

766
03:00:08,940 --> 03:00:10,540
All right, place your bets

767
03:00:10,540 --> 03:00:16,629
Place your bets, which one's going to be the last one remaining. I'm just going down to listening deleting them. Who's going to remain?

768
03:00:18,250 --> 03:00:32,940
Who's lights going to turn off last top right? That's cheating though. It wasn't even top right. It was this guy

769
03:00:33,020 --> 03:00:39,350
Who's this guy? Oh, it's me

770
03:00:41,290 --> 03:00:43,450
Oh, how many um, how many community subs do I have to give?

771
03:00:44,600 --> 03:00:46,819
six seven how many

772
03:00:46,819 --> 03:00:51,430
seven

773
03:00:51,430 --> 03:00:52,309
nine

774
03:00:52,309 --> 03:00:54,309
Where are you getting nine from?

775
03:00:55,350 --> 03:00:57,350
Nine, are you adding numbers on?

776
03:00:57,750 --> 03:01:00,569
Why do I look so weird? Oh, it's because i'm flipped

777
03:01:01,370 --> 03:01:03,370
It was nine. Was it nine?

778
03:01:03,530 --> 03:01:12,600
You're adding nine. Are you adding you're adding them? Are you getting a lot of sevens? It was nine you greedy

779
03:01:13,719 --> 03:01:19,079
But i'll just round it up to ten. Whatever. That's that's all good

780
03:01:20,040 --> 03:01:22,440
Sure, here i'll help you out here. Fuck

781
03:01:23,639 --> 03:01:25,639
Fuck fuck see there you go

782
03:01:25,639 --> 03:01:29,770
I have seven there's seven eight nine ten. We're gonna do ten do it right now

783
03:01:31,989 --> 03:01:33,989
So obviously those are you leaving i'll see you guys on friday

784
03:01:35,159 --> 03:01:40,200
Sorry again for the very short streams i've been doing recently, but it's very necessary

785
03:01:43,350 --> 03:01:45,989
We'll have a we're gonna have a ton of fun on friday

786
03:01:47,340 --> 03:01:50,139
the fucking webcam nonsense stream is gonna be

787
03:01:51,750 --> 03:01:56,709
Pretty fun unless it's all fucked up and doesn't work and then you'll hear a complaint about it for about 45 minutes

788
03:01:56,950 --> 03:01:59,799
While I play cooking mama, too. There you go

789
03:02:06,069 --> 03:02:08,069
Uh, let me give the subs

790
03:02:12,729 --> 03:02:14,729
Actually go to the outro

791
03:02:14,729 --> 03:02:17,530
So people know that i'm an outro. Ikaruga is actually that's a really good game

792
03:02:18,569 --> 03:02:23,989
That's a really cool mechanic. It's a classic. I'm glad I played half of it

793
03:02:24,629 --> 03:02:27,770
I'm glad I played half that game and then cheated for the rest

794
03:02:29,270 --> 03:02:34,709
All right gift community subs. Where is it? Fun fun fun fun

795
03:02:35,430 --> 03:02:38,309
Gift a sub you've gifted you've given

796
03:02:38,469 --> 03:02:40,469
791 gift subs

797
03:02:41,030 --> 03:02:47,479
Did when when have I given I've given 800 subs what when

798
03:02:48,040 --> 03:02:54,680
I remember a couple there was the one time when I did 500 like a couple months ago a month ago, right?

799
03:02:55,909 --> 03:03:13,659
That was like two weeks ago. Oh shit. Okay. All right gift subs 10 gift subs. Here they come 10 and

800
03:03:14,459 --> 03:03:23,270
There you gifted 10 tier one subscriptions. That puts me over 800. That's me 801

801
03:03:25,399 --> 03:03:27,399
Just giving money to twitch

802
03:03:28,440 --> 03:03:33,850
Yes, that's pretty much what i'm doing

803
03:03:34,250 --> 03:03:42,889
But anyways, let's uh, let's do the subs and the bits and everything. Thanks again for sticking around

804
03:03:43,610 --> 03:03:47,690
Hope to see you again soon

805
03:03:47,690 --> 03:03:49,690
on friday specifically

806
03:03:49,690 --> 03:03:57,049
Specifically on friday. I'm so pumped up for this thing. I'm going to do whatever it takes to make this work

807
03:03:57,850 --> 03:04:00,809
Even if I have to get like two or three computers in here to get this to work

808
03:04:00,809 --> 03:04:03,100
I'm gonna do it

809
03:04:03,100 --> 03:04:07,590
I gotta get like a list of of just weird shit to do and I mean like

810
03:04:07,829 --> 03:04:12,500
Puzzle the stick the human puzzle, right scrambling while i've tried to put together

811
03:04:13,479 --> 03:04:15,479
The fight in the room like the brawl

812
03:04:16,520 --> 03:04:19,340
Um, there's like at least there's at least like

813
03:04:19,879 --> 03:04:27,719
Five 15 minute bits here that will last us a good hour or two. Can't wait for cooking mama, right?

814
03:04:30,899 --> 03:04:36,409
All right, let's do the bits. We have 250 from hole of one zombie. Thank you hole of one zombie

815
03:04:36,729 --> 03:04:38,729
Let's turn the volume up a little bit. It's a little low

816
03:04:44,870 --> 03:04:49,430
It occurred to me that yesterday's viva piñata was like when you ask for a power rangers toy for christmas

817
03:04:49,750 --> 03:04:53,350
But get a bootleg wild ranger instead and proceed to cry

818
03:04:54,329 --> 03:04:56,760
It's great fun though

819
03:04:56,760 --> 03:04:59,639
What was wrong with this viva piñata? It was a good game, man

820
03:05:00,860 --> 03:05:03,659
What's wrong with it? It was viva piñata. It wasn't like

821
03:05:04,549 --> 03:05:05,879
what

822
03:05:05,879 --> 03:05:11,459
Whatever. Thanks for the 250 lm man. Thanks for the 250 germa

823
03:05:11,540 --> 03:05:14,500
Which wrestler in the rumble streams is the hardest to make earthworm jim?

824
03:05:16,659 --> 03:05:19,979
earthworm jim was the hardest character to make for sure because

825
03:05:20,620 --> 03:05:27,180
Painting his whole head took so long because of how long it took to load every single spray on his head

826
03:05:29,290 --> 03:05:29,930
Yeah

827
03:05:29,930 --> 03:05:35,290
Every every little detail on his face and shit just took so much stupid amount of time because of how that game loads layers

828
03:05:35,770 --> 03:05:47,000
I think it turned out all right though. Thank you to gnarly for the 250

829
03:05:47,079 --> 03:05:49,799
Hey, i'm glad you took my advice yesterday and did some more crack

830
03:05:50,280 --> 03:05:55,079
Before today's stream loving this new crack era of germa streams to keep up the great work. Wait, wait, wait are we?

831
03:05:55,959 --> 03:06:02,889
Boston era vegas era crack era. Is that where we are? Why does that chain of events?

832
03:06:04,260 --> 03:06:11,340
Sound very realistic. Yeah, that's fucked up. Oh boston vegas

833
03:06:12,659 --> 03:06:14,659
Crack now he's on that

834
03:06:17,270 --> 03:06:18,469
That's

835
03:06:18,469 --> 03:06:21,829
All right. Well, uh, see in like in seven or eight months

03:09:15,270 --> 03:09:18,469
Do it on ebay. Yeah, but ebay will take forever to get here

868
03:09:20,100 --> 03:09:23,219
If I do ebay, it will take like two weeks for this shit to get here

869
03:09:24,549 --> 03:09:27,590
all right, i'm gonna have to keep looking into this because

03:09:39,459 --> 03:09:43,059
I love how this one is webcam 1080p with microphone and cover

Anti-spy with like a thing like a thing of like an x over an i anti-spy

874
03:09:53,270 --> 03:09:59,340

HD smart mic, but I don't even will obs even take this in it's in stock

879
03:10:19,770 --> 03:10:24,090
If I buy 10 of these and they don't do anything. What the fuck am I gonna do?

880
03:10:27,049 --> 03:10:30,409
I'll figure this out over the next couple days. I gotta figure out this is impossible now

881
03:10:31,379 --> 03:10:32,420
well

882
03:10:32,420 --> 03:10:34,420
Cooking mama looks real fun now

883
03:10:37,860 --> 03:10:43,180
The world's supply of webcams. All right, i'll uh, let's keep going

884
03:10:46,950 --> 03:10:48,950
Let's keep going. I'll see if I can figure this out

885
03:10:49,190 --> 03:10:53,659
Thanks for that heads up though. I didn't realize that I didn't even think about that

886
03:10:56,569 --> 03:10:59,319
That was a dark soul

887
03:10:59,319 --> 03:11:01,319
Dark soul, uh gave us the heads up

888
03:11:01,479 --> 03:11:07,500
Hole of one zombie. Thanks for 250. I came back and thought you'd gotten all the power-ups

889
03:11:07,500 --> 03:11:10,459
I wasn't prepared for the germa ad event calendar

890
03:11:11,180 --> 03:11:18,260
Hey the plushie. Thanks for 250. Congrats. You got louis g'd all the way through bowser

891
03:11:18,899 --> 03:11:23,610
It's okay. That's all right. Sometimes you gotta

892
03:11:24,170 --> 03:11:26,170
Sometimes you gotta just let the game play

893
03:11:26,569 --> 03:11:32,489
And hang out sometimes freshly brewed cider

894
03:11:33,510 --> 03:11:38,389
Thanks for the 1500 bits 15 dollars. They say if you sat in a puddle of your own piss long enough

895
03:11:38,870 --> 03:11:45,129
Would your legs disintegrate? Why would your legs disintegrate?

896
03:11:51,370 --> 03:11:52,409
p

897
03:11:52,409 --> 03:12:00,040
P is just water and all the extra vitamin c that you didn't process. That's all it is

898
03:12:08,540 --> 03:12:10,540
It's just p and vitamin c. That's it. It's like

899
03:12:10,940 --> 03:12:20,020
You

900
03:12:20,260 --> 03:12:22,260
German is too iq if okay

901
03:12:22,899 --> 03:12:27,700
I know we fuck around a lot here. We do we really do but if you really think that I think that

902
03:12:28,899 --> 03:12:30,420
Human urine

903
03:12:30,420 --> 03:12:35,690
Is water and vitamin c. I don't I can't help you there

904
03:12:40,149 --> 03:12:42,469
I can't I think I really think that

905
03:12:43,030 --> 03:12:45,989
You think I actually think that water and vitamin c is piss

906
03:12:49,879 --> 03:12:56,229
No, it's that smelly stuff. That's in the cleaner bleach

907
03:12:57,190 --> 03:12:58,229
water and

908
03:12:58,229 --> 03:13:04,170
Whatever it is

909
03:13:04,170 --> 03:13:06,170
Whoa, that would fucking be horrible

910
03:13:07,459 --> 03:13:13,379
Hey dark soul, thanks for the 250 pretty unbased that you refuse to collab with coron just saying kind of cringe

911
03:13:13,379 --> 03:13:19,139
You know pretty stupid just saying ha just getting great stream streamer. Keep up the streams and stop fucking cheating one more sub

912
03:13:25,129 --> 03:13:27,129
All right weird talking about collabs

913
03:13:28,920 --> 03:13:31,559
I I fly solo until

914
03:13:32,600 --> 03:13:37,180
It's necessary for me to want to do anything with somebody else. We already talked about this

915
03:13:37,739 --> 03:13:40,620
I don't have plans to do any collabs. It's just if they happen they happen

916
03:13:41,340 --> 03:13:45,739
I'm I go i'm solo. This is solo act one-man show

917
03:13:51,780 --> 03:13:54,819
On solo and he was the coolest character in that whole show

918
03:13:55,459 --> 03:14:05,739
Okay, I just saw german 985 gave 10 community subs and I forgot and I thought somebody I don't know

919
03:14:05,739 --> 03:14:07,739
I thought somebody had the same name as me

920
03:14:07,819 --> 03:14:11,180
I was about to thank german 985 for 10 subs and I was like, wait a minute. That's me

921
03:14:11,899 --> 03:14:13,340
I just did that

922
03:14:13,340 --> 03:14:18,819
Right. Hey, sergel, but thanks to 250. I've been absent from streams recently

923
03:14:19,459 --> 03:14:21,860
preparing financially for the great depression 2

924
03:14:22,340 --> 03:14:26,020
Depressed harder makes me concerned for how you've been dealing with this

925
03:14:26,579 --> 03:14:28,899
You don't want to get too personal. Just give me a kiss instead

926
03:14:29,860 --> 03:14:32,979
How is that? No, that's like five times more. What are you what?

927
03:14:34,469 --> 03:14:40,149
um

928
03:14:40,149 --> 03:14:46,069
You got I was gonna like start saying like oh here and then you threw that in there and now i'm all you fucked me all up

929
03:14:46,870 --> 03:14:53,260
um

930
03:14:53,260 --> 03:14:55,620
Okay

931
03:14:55,620 --> 03:15:00,120
Well, I hope we don't get there. I really hope that that doesn't happen

932
03:15:01,079 --> 03:15:06,520
Hope that over the next few months we can really just try to get back to normal. Hopefully there's a

933
03:15:07,559 --> 03:15:09,559
Vaccine comes out sooner than

934
03:15:09,559 --> 03:15:14,520
Later, I know people are thinking it's maybe the end of the year or early next year. Hopefully we make it to there

935
03:15:16,340 --> 03:15:19,700
Slowly we get rid of this shit. That's what I hope that's what I really want

936
03:15:20,180 --> 03:15:24,379
Right. Everybody wants that

937
03:15:24,379 --> 03:15:27,500
We've been told like 12 to 18 months for a vaccine

938
03:15:29,719 --> 03:15:31,399
and now hopefully

939
03:15:31,399 --> 03:15:34,219
over the next few months

940
03:15:34,219 --> 03:15:37,579
We start to cases start to slow down. That's the number one thing

941
03:15:39,020 --> 03:15:40,940
Once you're in a pandemic

942
03:15:40,940 --> 03:15:44,219
It's people are going to get it. It's going to spread. That's what a virus does, right?

943
03:15:44,379 --> 03:15:50,620
But to try to make it so it doesn't spread everywhere to everyone is what we're trying to do

944
03:15:56,889 --> 03:15:58,170
Be careful

945
03:15:58,170 --> 03:16:01,290
especially if you are in direct contact with people that

946
03:16:01,930 --> 03:16:08,090
Are susceptible to the illness right leg if you have older people people with underlying conditions, right?

947
03:16:08,090 --> 03:16:11,370
I mean, I know i'm saying the things that you've already heard but we have to we have to say it

948
03:16:11,370 --> 03:16:14,090
We have to think about it. We got to talk about it. Don't be fucking careful

949
03:16:14,649 --> 03:16:17,270
Take care of yourselves wash your hands

950
03:16:17,350 --> 03:16:29,110
Don't get too close to anybody right? Just don't spread the damn thing. That's the bad part. That's what yeah, that's what i'm saying

951
03:16:29,750 --> 03:16:42,309
I'm blocking my neighborhood at a block party yesterday

952
03:16:44,459 --> 03:16:51,690
What the hell are they doing?

953
03:16:52,170 --> 03:16:53,770
That's

954
03:16:53,770 --> 03:16:55,290
doesn't make any sense

955
03:16:55,290 --> 03:17:00,819
Hey, you know this like this big virus going around that like it's really starting to cases are starting to

956
03:17:01,700 --> 03:17:03,940
Inflate in the in the country

957
03:17:04,659 --> 03:17:10,100
You know what a great idea would be to like put myself with a bunch of other people

958
03:17:10,500 --> 03:17:15,860
And as as many people as we can get in the same place and let's all sing songs out loud

959
03:17:23,239 --> 03:17:25,239
That's like how it spreads

960
03:17:25,799 --> 03:17:34,629
And I know and I know the thing is what i'm not gonna get it. I'm not gonna get it

961
03:17:35,270 --> 03:17:38,629
Right, but if you if you touch the surface

962
03:17:39,270 --> 03:17:44,629
Or you came into contact with the doorknob that had it on there and then you don't get it

963
03:17:45,030 --> 03:17:47,030
But you give it to somebody else

964
03:17:47,899 --> 03:17:49,579
And they get it

965
03:17:49,579 --> 03:17:51,579
That's how this happens

966
03:18:00,090 --> 03:18:03,450
You might not get it, but you might be the reason why 30 other people do

967
03:18:04,010 --> 03:18:20,659
Sure, but you literally just kissed someone. No

968
03:18:26,170 --> 03:18:29,370
Just be careful. Don't don't do any of that shit

969
03:18:29,450 --> 03:18:34,649
There's no reason like i've seen like the photos of like the beaches and people are like fucking on the beach

970
03:18:38,459 --> 03:18:41,500
Like let's hey, let's let's play tag on the beach

971
03:18:42,540 --> 03:18:44,459
No, what are you doing?

972
03:18:44,459 --> 03:18:53,459
Get go home

973
03:18:53,459 --> 03:18:56,629
but anyways

974
03:18:56,629 --> 03:19:00,549
I really hope that we can hit I we need to hit up we need to hit that

975
03:19:01,530 --> 03:19:03,690
Flat like they say flatten it flatten it

976
03:19:04,649 --> 03:19:06,329
We're gonna see more cases

977
03:19:06,329 --> 03:19:13,450
But just we gotta fucking make it so hospitals don't get overrun by people. That's the main problem, right?

978
03:19:14,649 --> 03:19:19,290
I know it's like oh, it's a it's like the flu. It's like a bad flu. It's a lot of a well

979
03:19:19,290 --> 03:19:21,610
A lot of people say it's just like the bad flu. It's all good

980
03:19:22,489 --> 03:19:29,459
yeah, but if when fucking a hundred thousand people in the same city get it at the same time and

981
03:19:31,040 --> 03:19:34,979
20,000 of them need potentially to go to the emergency room

982
03:19:35,989 --> 03:19:40,569
That's the problem

983
03:19:40,569 --> 03:19:43,350
That's the issue

984
03:19:43,350 --> 03:19:45,350
Right. It's a big part of it

985
03:19:58,059 --> 03:20:00,059
People are dying from this. Yes, they are

986
03:20:01,399 --> 03:20:10,280
It's not just old people. It's younger people too. It's mainly about making sure our hospitals don't get overrun

987
03:20:13,190 --> 03:20:19,510
Because when you're out of beds and you're out of ventilators and and somebody comes in and they need one and you don't have one

988
03:20:20,600 --> 03:20:24,309
You don't have a bed for that person

989
03:20:24,389 --> 03:20:33,159
That's where it gets very bad

990
03:20:33,159 --> 03:20:35,639
Yes, that's why it's important to stop the spread now. Yes

991
03:20:37,430 --> 03:20:43,260
Exactly, you guys get it

992
03:20:43,260 --> 03:20:47,100
I don't we don't I don't want to continue to we can move on from this but

993
03:20:49,670 --> 03:20:54,229
It is good to talk about sometimes just to make sure kind of everybody's on the same page

994
03:20:55,799 --> 03:20:58,040
It is a current fucking huge problem right now

995
03:20:58,680 --> 03:21:06,309
Take care of yourselves

996
03:21:06,309 --> 03:21:07,879
Wash your hands

997
03:21:07,879 --> 03:21:17,540
Stay safe moving on we had 400 bits from sergeant chicken wing. Thank you for those

998
03:21:18,260 --> 03:21:19,299
Four dollars

999
03:21:19,299 --> 03:21:23,290
Jeremy kind of out of the loop since I missed a couple streams. Why all the short streams lately?

1000
03:21:23,290 --> 03:21:25,290
Are you moving again? Or did he miss something? Yes

1001
03:21:25,610 --> 03:21:28,489
Kim and I are in the process right now

1002
03:21:28,809 --> 03:21:32,680
of moving

1003
03:21:32,680 --> 03:21:38,040
We're anticipating we did a lot of stuff last week to get ready and start getting out

1004
03:21:38,600 --> 03:21:40,409
and over these next

1005
03:21:40,409 --> 03:21:43,770
Probably six to fifteen seven to fifteen days

1006
03:21:45,030 --> 03:21:48,149
We hope to be finally completely out completely

1007
03:21:49,290 --> 03:21:54,489
the issue and the reason why it hasn't happened already is because because of what we were just talking about with the coronavirus

1008
03:21:55,670 --> 03:21:58,040
A lot of stuff is a lot slower

1009
03:21:58,200 --> 03:22:02,040
whether that be trying to find apartments or a house to go to or

1010
03:22:03,370 --> 03:22:07,450
It's services that you need it for a for a new place it it's

1011
03:22:08,010 --> 03:22:19,159
Everything's very slowed down a lot. So it's we're trying to do it as best we can no more webcams. No

1012
03:22:20,620 --> 03:22:23,340
If las vegas is so good, how come there's no las vegas too?

1013
03:22:23,979 --> 03:22:32,729
Why would they need to be on what?

1014
03:22:32,729 --> 03:22:34,729
but that's why they've been shorter I

1015
03:22:35,829 --> 03:22:37,430
anticipate

1016
03:22:37,430 --> 03:22:39,500
that the

1017
03:22:39,500 --> 03:22:43,370
after this coming weekend, so let's say

1018
03:22:44,920 --> 03:22:46,440
after like

1019
03:22:46,440 --> 03:22:51,559
Somewhere around the the first week of april second week of april. I plan to be back to normal

1020
03:22:52,360 --> 03:22:54,440
with streaming and that means

1021
03:22:55,989 --> 03:23:03,239
Obviously streams that are more than four hours long back to kind of that normal like six to seven six to eight

1022
03:23:03,959 --> 03:23:06,860
We'll see that's that's the plan

1023
03:23:06,860 --> 03:23:14,780
but also

1024
03:23:14,780 --> 03:23:18,309
There's nothing to consider

1025
03:23:18,309 --> 03:23:20,659
I might try

1026
03:23:20,659 --> 03:23:27,420
Something in the future here when this is all said and done typically this stream is live

1027
03:23:28,379 --> 03:23:33,690
Three or four times a week for about six to eight hours, right?

1028
03:23:34,569 --> 03:23:38,069
I was thinking

1029
03:23:38,069 --> 03:23:39,739
maybe

1030
03:23:39,739 --> 03:23:41,739
What if that turned into?

1031
03:23:41,819 --> 03:23:44,219
like four or five days a week

1032
03:23:45,430 --> 03:23:46,680
but

1033
03:23:46,680 --> 03:23:51,139
Pulled back to about three or four hours a stream. I was trying to think of

1034
03:23:51,860 --> 03:23:56,440
And that though there's a reason why the only reason why I say this is because

1035
03:23:57,319 --> 03:23:59,000
The last three or four days

1036
03:23:59,000 --> 03:24:05,049
Remember we talked about how about the costochondritis and this potential like arthritis shit is like fucking me up

1037
03:24:06,940 --> 03:24:08,940
Sitting down for more than a few hours

1038
03:24:10,329 --> 03:24:12,809
When I get up after these three four hours streams

1039
03:24:14,139 --> 03:24:16,299
I feel okay. I feel all right

1040
03:24:17,239 --> 03:24:25,190
and I think that sitting down and being in the same place for more than six seven eight plus hours is

1041
03:24:26,649 --> 03:24:29,049
I think it's not helping. Let's just put it that way

1042
03:24:30,440 --> 03:24:35,239
And until I can have some type of solution where I have a standing desk where I can really just move around

1043
03:24:37,239 --> 03:24:38,920
I might try it

1044
03:24:38,920 --> 03:24:44,229
Maybe I haven't made a decision on it yet, but I was thinking about it

1045
03:24:47,340 --> 03:24:53,899
You know like four or five days a week for like three to five hour streams instead of three days a week eight hour streams

1046
03:24:55,100 --> 03:24:59,829
Or eight plus whatever you want to call them. I'm trying to figure it out

1047
03:25:03,590 --> 03:25:05,350
Do yoga breaks?

1048
03:25:05,350 --> 03:25:07,750
Yeah, the thing is though when you get into something

1049
03:25:08,709 --> 03:25:12,069
If i'm gonna sit here and stream and i'm into something and i'm having fun. I want to stick around it

1050
03:25:13,909 --> 03:25:18,469
Take getting up for 20 minutes and is that's it takes throws me off

1051
03:25:19,670 --> 03:25:21,670
Like i'd like to just kind of sit here and do what I want to do

1052
03:25:22,229 --> 03:25:30,360
I have not decided that that's gonna happen, but it's something that's floating around. Just want to let you know

1053
03:25:34,979 --> 03:25:36,979
Yeah, it would be more frequent but shorter

1054
03:25:38,250 --> 03:25:42,459
Rather than less frequent but longer we'll move on

1055
03:25:43,989 --> 03:25:48,950
Uh, thank you the sticky stick man for the 250. Hey germa first time catching the end of a stream from over here in europe

1056
03:25:49,510 --> 03:25:55,270
Thanks for keeping us entertained during this tough time. Hope all goes well with the move. Stay healthy you as well. Thank you for

1057
03:25:56,700 --> 03:25:57,819
kind words

1058
03:25:57,819 --> 03:26:05,559
I need to gain muscle and eat properly. I I I eat I eat fine

1059
03:26:06,120 --> 03:26:08,360
I eat at least two green vegetables every day

1060
03:26:09,610 --> 03:26:13,799
And they come out it comes out of a can but I still eat them. All right, let's do the credits

1061
03:26:14,520 --> 03:26:16,899
I'm gonna bump you. Whoops

1062
03:26:16,899 --> 03:26:22,600
Thanks for watching everybody. We'll see you on friday for hopefully the webcam

1063
03:26:23,219 --> 03:26:25,799
insanity stream

1064
03:26:25,799 --> 03:26:28,139
If I can get them

1065
03:26:28,139 --> 03:26:30,219
If I can figure out how to get those

1066
03:26:31,319 --> 03:26:42,409
If not, then we'll do something else. Of course, let's run the credits. You should see them any second

1067
03:26:42,729 --> 03:26:45,860
These are all the subs from today

1068
03:26:46,420 --> 03:26:51,959
plum today

1069
03:26:51,959 --> 03:26:56,920
Even with a three hour stream still a shitload of people subscribe, which is insane. Thank you guys

1070
03:27:01,860 --> 03:27:03,860
Thanks for the continued support

1071
03:27:03,860 --> 03:27:09,219
If you guys give a lot of money as always. Thank you

1072
03:27:09,860 --> 03:27:14,379
Is it only three hours? Yes, about three hours and 30 minutes if you count

1073
03:27:15,420 --> 03:27:26,309
The end of the stream here 25 minutes. Thank you one blondie for the 300 bits germa. I love you

1074
03:27:27,379 --> 03:27:40,200
Do you though do you are you sure you do you sure you know, are you sure about that love is a strong word

1075
03:27:41,479 --> 03:27:53,620
Are you still at 10k subs? No, no crossing that threshold was fucking ludicrous

1076
03:27:55,989 --> 03:27:57,989
So it is we've since come down

1077
03:28:03,110 --> 03:28:05,110
But still even after losing

1078
03:28:05,909 --> 03:28:11,989
Those subs from new years is still a shitload of people that is subbed to the channel. There's still a ton

1079
03:28:16,360 --> 03:28:18,040
like

1080
03:28:18,120 --> 03:28:23,079
It's just it's still increasing. Let's just put it that way and it's blows my fucking mind

1081
03:28:26,809 --> 03:28:28,729
What are we at now? Let's see. Let's just tell you

1082
03:28:30,389 --> 03:28:34,700
Uh, we are at we've been we've been hovering

1083
03:28:36,250 --> 03:28:38,219
this channel

1084
03:28:38,219 --> 03:28:40,219
uh, it is

1085
03:28:41,639 --> 03:28:44,950
7,800 holy shit. Yeah, so we've come down from 10

1086
03:28:45,750 --> 03:28:47,030
but

1087
03:28:47,030 --> 03:28:49,030
7,800 subs is still

1088
03:28:49,750 --> 03:28:52,069
a monumental amount of paid subscriptions

1089
03:28:56,920 --> 03:29:01,399
Even if it anything there's a lot of people that's a lot of subscriptions

1090
03:29:08,440 --> 03:29:14,219
Somebody said dead channel. Oh my god. Okay, it was

1091
03:29:19,530 --> 03:29:24,299
That's fucking funny

1092
03:29:24,299 --> 03:29:29,979
No, I can't I every time I open up my stream manager guys and I look at that I go that's fucking why?

1093
03:29:30,540 --> 03:29:32,540
That's a lot. That's a that's too many

1094
03:29:33,100 --> 03:29:38,459
That's too many people that are okay. That's a that's a lot and then I hit the broadcast button

1095
03:29:42,549 --> 03:29:44,059
anyways

1096
03:29:44,059 --> 03:29:47,659
Let's uh, we got one more message to get to just came in right now

1097
03:29:48,219 --> 03:29:54,780
Somebody's gonna fucking scream by the house. That's fine. See you guys on friday

1098
03:29:55,420 --> 03:30:00,379
And we have tar alecran one of the band. Wait, did I ever unban tar? I think I did right?

1099
03:30:00,620 --> 03:30:06,219
Thanks for 250. First of all, they say germa. Hi, it's tar here when you banned yesterday because you streamed

1100
03:30:06,620 --> 03:30:08,940
Despite my prediction that you wouldn't for the record

1101
03:30:08,940 --> 03:30:14,459
My original statement was the odds of germa moving and streaming by the end of the week are less than zero

1102
03:30:14,700 --> 03:30:21,239
Which was proven 1000 true since you didn't even move. I can't believe you even banned me temporarily

1103
03:30:21,239 --> 03:30:25,399
You're a disgraceful streamer. There was no sense of justice or honor. Yes

1104
03:30:25,399 --> 03:30:29,079
Love the stream been subbed for 42 months now waiting for my three-year badge, please

1105
03:30:29,879 --> 03:30:40,329
Did you see the I got I got the book thrown at me. Wait, why did this not what?

1106
03:30:41,209 --> 03:30:47,129
Oh, sorry, I fucked that up. They end up again for calling you out

1107
03:30:47,610 --> 03:30:49,159
Well, I can't do that

1108
03:30:49,159 --> 03:30:54,440
I mean like we just both walked out of the courtroom with our luggage and shit under our arms and different lawyers

1109
03:30:55,530 --> 03:30:59,049
Well, I can't what am I gonna I can't sue you if you win the case

1115
03:31:17,879 --> 03:31:25,049
No, that's not how it works

All right, let's write somebody who you won't see me for a few days

We got key. Oh key. Oh key. Well, I never catch key. Well every streaming

Because I never I never end my streams
