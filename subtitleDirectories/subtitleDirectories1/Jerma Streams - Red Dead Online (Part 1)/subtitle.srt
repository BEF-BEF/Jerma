1
00:00:02,229 --> 00:00:08,009
That title could be better, couldn't it? That's as literal as you can get.

2
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:12,330
And that's not even Red Dead 2. That's Red Dead Multiplayer. What if people don't know I'm playing

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:25,690
the new one? How about, uh, Rootin' Tootin' Cowboy 2. Let's see, uh, Red Dead. There's no redemption

4
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:33,850
in there. That's the first one. That's the one that was for PlayStation 2. Red Dead...

5
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:50,170
I don't know, how do you... Multiplayer. Rootin' Tootin' 2 Multiplayer. Cowboys using the

6
00:00:50,170 --> 00:01:07,590
internet. No, but that's not even in the game though. How about this? All right, give me a sec.

7
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:56,840
One sec. There. I made it an IGN article. Is that better? The lawless land of Red Dead

8
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:09,990
Redemption 2 Online. And then in brackets it's going to say, watch out for gnomes.

9
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:16,169
This stream is known to gnome. But anyway, hi guys. I didn't even... I gotta make a fucking

10
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:25,639
tweet. I gotta see... I gotta make a tweet first. Is this sponsored? I don't think you could even

11
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:31,560
get a Rockstar game sponsorship. I don't think that exists. I'm not sure it's a good thing.

12
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:44,099
They're gnome... they're gnome to gnome. Why am I... I'm saying this right now. I don't even

13
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:57,879
like that thing. All right, let's, uh, let's move this over here so we can actually see the

14
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:04,939
game. I'd say that's a good idea, isn't it? I have to sign my life away though. That's the

15
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:14,870
thing. This doesn't have, like, online policies. Just want to make sure everyone's aware on this

16
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:22,550
channel. Well, I just want to make people trickle in so I can talk about it. Give me

17
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:40,460
one second. What if I don't? What's all that... there's like fucking people smoking motorcycles

18
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:56,680
by. Just like... I can hear... I can still hear that guy. All right, so for those of you that

19
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:02,120
are fairly new to the channel or those of you that, you know, whatever, I want to make sure

20
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,439
that what I'm doing... because I come from a law background. Before Twitch,

21
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:13,639
uh, I was a... I was in a law firm. My parents owned... there was... they were a dual...

22
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:18,360
uh, they were husband and wife law team and I was the son and they were gonna bring me up as

23
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,360
like the law prince. So I need to read this shit and I'm gonna read it the whole time.

24
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,439
So I need to know what I'm getting myself into. So what we do is...

25
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:50,889
My mom and dad aren't gonna like me anymore! Hey, welcome to Red Dead 2 Online. I'm excited.

26
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:59,300
You just woke my dad up. Hey dad! It's me, the law prince!

27
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:14,550
All right, so how does this work? Am I gonna have fun? Should I turn off voice chat already?

28
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:24,279
Is there a story here? I'm so excited. I can't wait for the first person that right when I

29
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:39,430
fucking spawn puts me into a hogtie. I can't wait. I gotta make my character

30
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:45,220
choose a character. Okay, we're gonna go with this guy.

31
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:57,160
How much different is there, uh, is there a character creator? What's that, 6-1?

32
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:08,360
All right, we gotta get a good name. Good name. Hmm, I don't know what he looks like quite yet, so...

33
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:18,490
No, it can't be just a beer. It's gotta be something better than that.

34
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:24,819
No, I'm not even gonna look at chat. I'm not even looking at chat right now. I'm gonna come

35
00:06:24,819 --> 00:07:32,490
up with my own name. No, no, what the fuck? No, not Prawn. Why? Prawny. Prawny Phil. Prawny PM.

36
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:47,980
Prawny Phil. Prawny Philadelphia. Prawny philosophy. Prawny Philip. Prawny Philip. Prawny

37
00:07:47,980 --> 00:08:00,709
Philip is better. Why though? Because just wait till I make his hands.

38
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:19,579
No, no, Prawny Philip G. That's his name. Prawny Philip. Prawny Philip.

39
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:37,529
Prawny. That's an old west name. Prawny Phil. Oh fuck, I know why I named him that. I don't

40
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:45,669
know. I was thinking of Bill Murray last night. That's Punxsutawney Phil from Groundhog Day. Oh

41
00:08:45,669 --> 00:09:02,309
well. Punxsutawney Prawny Phil. Okay, let's see. Oh, dude, I took a picture of my face

42
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:33,830
every day for five years. That looks good. Dude, I took a picture of my body every day

43
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:56,549
for three days. This is what happened. This is what my body did. Should it be like

44
00:09:56,549 --> 00:10:12,440
18? This guy's 18. That's a lie. Does it actually change your face? No, this doesn't change

45
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:25,830
anything. 60. No, he's gonna be 18. Dude, I took a picture of my birth certificate of my

46
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:52,710
birthday cards every year since I was 18. He had a heart attack, fortunately. Prawny Build.

47
00:10:52,710 --> 00:11:01,799
Prawny Skinny. Athletic. He's gonna, I mean, I have to make a Prawny guy. I can't just

48
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:16,169
not make a guy Prawny, right? Carefree. Broad. Narrow. The closer they are to the bridge of my

49
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:26,460
nose, the better. That's just the way it is. That looks pretty good. How do I change his

50
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:41,350
name? Wait, can I go even further than this? Customize, though. Oh, damn, you can. High

51
00:11:41,429 --> 00:12:01,639
brow. Deep brows. Eye color. Green. Eye redness. We get red eyes. All right, this is the

52
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:17,320
seventh, this is the eighth dwarf. Looks smoky. This is a gnome. No, it's not a gnome. I said

53
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,759
dwarf. Like the seven dwarfs. It's not the seven, it's not the seven gnomes, guys.

54
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:39,129
That looks good. All right, I position up. Yeah, actually down. Down and in. All right, looks

55
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:53,500
good. Nose. Neutral. How do I customize? It's gotta be low and wide and it's gonna be long.

56
00:12:54,379 --> 00:13:03,059
Long and long into the, let's see, long into the left, baby. Ha ha, it's a funny character.

57
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:16,230
I haven't even made him yet. I haven't even made the guy. What? You can't say that yet. I

58
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:25,830
haven't even made him. Just wait till I get to his hands. Smoocher. What the fuck does that mean?

59
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:37,240
Mouth position. Up is fine. I'm not gonna, I don't think I'm gonna have this beard.

60
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:46,230
Thin and narrow on the upper lip and then like a, like a big,

61
00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:57,820
like he's got like, he's got like fucking chew in his mouth. Yeah, that looks good.

62
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,330
Keep the beard. Well, the beard is still there.

63
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:35,929
Ha ha, it's just Jerva Pluto. No, from the side. Look at him from the side. He looks like that

64
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:57,399
henchman from the Looney Tunes. Tilt high and wide. Go deep. Deep chin depth. Okay, all right.

65
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:19,850
So, is it a whistle? He's like a bird. Clarity? So what if it's not clear?

66
00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:32,539
No, it's really breathy. It's going through his teeth. Teeth ready.

67
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:47,480
I like the really high pitched one. That means anybody can hear me from a mile away.

68
00:15:50,549 --> 00:16:05,539
Nice style. Ow. Ugh. Jesus. These are not whistles. This is, I just turned on the TV

69
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:22,980
at grandma's house. All right, that one's fine. All right, attributes. Health. Oh,

70
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:28,820
is where we're gonna be. Careful. Two points left. I can't, can I not pull points away?

71
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:37,799
I'm gonna probably say health. Health is probably the most important thing. Health and stamina.

72
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:46,139
Forget about Deadeye. You can use Deadeye online. Well, how does that work on the internet?

73
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:53,769
You turn off everybody's game for five seconds? Am I, are you able to actually do that to

74
00:16:53,769 --> 00:17:02,980
other players? It's gonna make them really burly. Health is most important. I want to be

75
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:08,470
able to run around and like punch people and stuff. I like all funny. Okay, attributes. How

76
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:30,279
do I change his fronty philip? Turn based. Appearance. Scroll down. Oh, okay. This is

77
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:35,160
the only complaint I ever had about Red Dead Redemption 2 is you have all this room below

78
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:41,240
this. Like I know the number is there, but I wish they would just extend that menu down

79
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:47,819
like three slots. All right, so we got mouth and lips. Did that. Ears. Cheeks. Here we go.

80
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:56,839
Goofy. Large. You can click on them. I don't have my, I got a controller in my hand.

81
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:07,829
Neutral. No, we're not doing the comedy ears. I could make another Snow White reference here

82
00:18:07,829 --> 00:18:14,309
though. These are all the dwarves. Small. Droopy. Goofy. Hold on a minute. Goofy.

83
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:21,750
Neutral. Large. Small. Droopy. Yeah, and there's only like four, like five gnomes.

84
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:30,200
Never mind. Keep that one. Cheeks. Let's take off. I need to take this off. Wide.

85
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:40,490
Uh, gaunt. Looks good. Teeth. Chompers. Plum. Warout. I need to take off the

86
00:18:42,140 --> 00:19:02,140
hair for a second here. I mean, this one is pretty good. I'm not going to do this one.

87
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,420
This one's too easy to just be the fucking weirdo online.

88
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:20,700
No, I can't, I like this one. This one is just weird enough.

89
00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:45,799
And the guy's 18. Blonde hair. Yeah, that's fine. Facial hair. Okay. 18 with a full,

90
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:58,490
like gray beard. Like dirty. That's fine. No, I don't like that. No, actually that's okay.

91
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:16,069
Lifestyle. What is it? What's, what's going on? Complexion. Get rid of the facial hair.

92
00:20:16,069 --> 00:20:30,869
What is, what are they talking about? Oh. Oh, I see. Okay. He's 18. I mean, he could be,

93
00:20:30,869 --> 00:20:38,569
right? Like, couldn't he be 18? This is just Chris Griffin. I accidentally made Chris Griffin.

94
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:44,650
Chris Griffin does look like this. Chris Griffin is 18. Or like 14 or something, right?

95
00:20:45,369 --> 00:21:01,579
No, I'm not going to name him Chris Griffin. Why the fuck would I do that?

96
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:20,140
It's not going to be Chris Griffin. No. No. Do it. Do it.

97
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:54,279
Looks like Owen Wilson. Chris Griffin. No, I'm going to keep the facial hair off,

98
00:21:54,279 --> 00:22:00,339
but his name is Prani Phil. Okay. I'm going to keep the fucking stupid hair.

99
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:03,460
I'm going to keep his fucked up face, but I'm not changing his name to Chris

100
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:21,690
Griffin. Okay. Attributes. We already did it. Appearance. That's Prani Phil. Get his beard

101
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:46,180
back. I kind of like it like this. No, that's it. What? What's with the background there?

102
00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:00,170
No, guys, this is not all these. This is, this is Prani Phil.

103
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:09,940
Dumb and dumber. It really does look like, what's not Lloyd? Harry. No, it is,

104
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:17,509
it's Harry, right? It's just Harry from Dumb and Dumber.

105
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:29,299
I can't wait to get a shotgun shot directly into the back of my head when I spawn at the

106
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:33,059
at the newbie level one. Welcome to Goldshire.

107
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:51,900
So I'm in jail. They're going to come across me.

108
00:23:58,619 --> 00:24:04,940
Hey, uh, hey, Lloyd. You with the hammer and you, you'll do. We need to perform a work

109
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:11,180
detail out in roads. Come on, get in. Open the gate. You guys think I'm out of place

110
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:15,930
and you don't think that guy is, you don't think saber tooth from X-Men is out of place,

111
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:34,220
but fucking Harry from Dumb and Dumber apparently is. Red Dead Online. Yeah,

112
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:38,940
I can't, I can't have a voice like this. I tell you what, I can't talk like that.

113
00:24:39,099 --> 00:24:41,339
I'm going to keep this one and I'm going to be a Barney from.

114
00:24:55,859 --> 00:24:58,740
And it's still Harry. Barney Rubble is Harry.

115
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:17,619
Education. So how does this all start? How does this start? How does this all start? I don't know.

116
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:26,009
Good day, gentlemen. Oh, don't do anything stupid. Nobody gets shot. Act like fools

117
00:25:26,009 --> 00:25:30,809
and the pair of you will be dead within a minute. Now, what are your names? Jenkins

118
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:36,650
and Millican. Well, Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Millican throw your guns to the ground and

119
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:42,650
get on down here. They break me up. There's Arthur. Very glad to meet you. It's not worth

120
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:49,049
being rash. I found Arthur. What's going on? You get that salary whether these people escape

121
00:25:49,049 --> 00:26:01,640
or not. Your wives presumably want you alive. Let them out now. Please. Okay. Okay. You all

122
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:08,859
run away. Aside from you. Try to stay out of trouble. This is a stroke of good fortune

123
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:16,460
for all of you. Use it. Okay. Now, Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Millican, be so kind as to

124
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:21,420
you in the back. You're the ugliest person in the whole carriage. You're coming with us.

125
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:29,130
Go on. Don't look back. Mr. Wynn, I believe it was $50 we agreed on. It was? Here's 50 each.

126
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:34,809
Each? Yes. Now get out of here, both of you. My employer and I appreciate your professionalism.

127
00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:38,650
All we did was stand there and look tough. And you did it fantastically well.

128
00:26:39,609 --> 00:26:44,089
I'm gonna be some storied criminal. How about you pick up these guns and we move out.

129
00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:55,740
My mistress is waiting for us. Follow the string. You better get on this horse.

130
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:05,960
Now. Well, this is different. You can do anything in Red Dead Online too, right?

131
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,359
I haven't got far to ride. I can ride a horse? Ready?

132
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:13,940
Holy shit. I hope you'll. How does the controls work?

133
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:22,339
My employer. Okay. My name is Mr. Horley, by the way. Six months.

134
00:27:22,339 --> 00:27:26,740
Well, hold X while riding to match the speed. This is fucking crazy.

135
00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:32,500
If I tilt the stick left or right, I turn left or right.

136
00:27:35,369 --> 00:27:38,410
How's that even possible? Like I'm not doing that in real life.

137
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:58,869
I'm going to strangle you. Hey, whoa. Easy, man.

138
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:02,869
I hope you mean in Red Dead Redemption 2 Online.

139
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:19,450
That's Horley. Okay, Horley. I'm ready to start my adventure on

140
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:29,539
Red Dead. There's a post right here. All right, let's do it. Let's do it.

141
00:28:44,579 --> 00:28:47,220
See how good they're getting 3D in these things here.

142
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:52,039
Hello. Jessica, the clerk. How do you do? What did you tell him?

143
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:59,349
Nothing, as we discussed. Thank you, Horley. I do hope we have an

144
00:28:59,349 --> 00:29:03,509
inconvenience to you dreadfully, but seeing as you would do to be hanged in a week,

145
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:06,549
I'm sure you don't object too strongly. That's very interesting to us.

146
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:12,470
I know you're innocent. Well, not perhaps exactly innocent, but not guilty of what

147
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:17,190
you were accused. I know you and those who were with you that died were little more than

148
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:22,869
patsies and that you were set up by one of three men or a woman, possibly by all of them.

149
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:25,910
Every time he makes a reaction, I feel like this is going to come out of his mouth.

150
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:32,309
And one of these people also made Mrs. LeClerc a widow.

151
00:29:32,309 --> 00:29:39,190
And I will avenge my husband's death, so help me, God. But I will not avenge it upon them who did

152
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:46,069
not cause it or caused it unwillingly. Anyway, I'm sure this is all a touch confusing and

153
00:29:46,069 --> 00:29:52,069
melodramatic. Where are my manners? Horley, please show our guests to their tent and

154
00:29:52,069 --> 00:29:54,549
give them some fresh clothes to put on. Very good, madam.

155
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:57,430
Then serve us both a little refreshment. Certainly, madam.

156
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:00,549
This way. You'll find a change of clothes in there.

157
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:02,630
Hey, look, it's a camp just like in the regular main game.

158
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:06,549
Also a few other items you might need. A lasso, a knife, and a lantern, I believe.

159
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,960
Wardrobe, here we go. This is where we stand out from the rest of the crowd

160
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:24,299
in GTA Online because we purchased, we got the $70 hat pack, so we get to wear this instead.

161
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,460
All right, well, I just turned him into Ebeneezer Scrooge, so that's fine too.

162
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:50,250
Now vest, and no, he's gonna have a shirt on. He's turning, what does he, what does he look

163
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:58,569
like? He's turning into something. Oh man, this character from a movie.

164
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:06,099
I don't know who he's turning into. It's like a Muppet or something, I forget.

165
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:21,930
Who's the Muppet that looks like this? I think, well, no, that's,

166
00:31:22,809 --> 00:31:36,660
just everyday shirt is fine. Yeah, that's good. All right, suspenders. Yeah, that looks good.

167
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:44,359
I don't like that color though, there we go. Dante from Devil May Cry. I don't,

168
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:59,670
I already told you, just wait till I get to his hands. Nevermind. All right, so we got gloves,

169
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:05,109
item up, weapon equipment. I don't have any equipment. I can't modify, I have a collar.

170
00:32:06,309 --> 00:32:21,930
Open, full sleeves, boots. Yeah, I like that. Okay, pants. Level up to rank 24 to unlock

171
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:43,380
this item. What? Don't I already have it? Well, whatever. No, not bare feet, he'll step on a

172
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:49,319
fucking log and die. Guys, this is, this is like, this is like 19, like 24 or something.

173
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:55,940
I don't want to step on a log and die. So George Washington died. He got a splinter

174
00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:07,509
and they fucking bled him to death. All right, exit the wardrobe when you're ready.

175
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:12,519
I'm ready. Exiting the wardrobe will finalize your starting clothes. Are you sure you want

176
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:40,470
to leave? Yes. Why am I so small? Oh, nevermind, she was up on the thing. Okay. I know what

177
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:46,869
that's like to have a photo that's manipulated. Standing on a hill in San Francisco, which should

178
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:52,710
be 2142 in italics. And I was at the bottom of the hill. And it was literally in out in some

179
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:58,950
restaurant San Francisco with a fucking sidewalks are like 75 degrees. And I'm all the way to the

180
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:04,150
end. I know what that's like. different bullets to those you possessed when you were arrested.

181
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:12,090
These fucking photo manipulation mistake. You were rounded up and sentenced to death

182
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:19,210
all because you came to town and didn't talk too much and seemed like you were nasty. Anyway,

183
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:28,170
cool story. The people who run Blackwater, Mr. Jeremiah Shaw, banker, real estate speculator,

184
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:35,610
and crook, Mr. Amos Lansing, ranch owner, these are the players and crook. Mrs. Grace,

185
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:38,969
when you get to the top of when you get to rank 10 in GTA online,

186
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:42,170
lover of the arts, you become this cutscene for all the new players

187
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:47,449
and have a bounty on your head. Why didn't they do that? A disgraced brother,

188
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:54,730
outlaw, wanted man and still in contact with them. All I ask of you is your help in finding

189
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:58,730
out quite what happened. This is the clerk would like to help you get back on your feet.

190
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:04,969
I do consulting work. Whatever your work may be. I don't judge. You want to rob?

191
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:11,530
Looks like that looks good. You want to save innocent folk? Do that as well. But you need me

192
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:18,170
just as much as I need you. I think we all understand each other. I hope we do. I kind

193
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:24,969
of missed the silent protagonist. Good. I look forward to rewarding you for killing.

194
00:35:24,969 --> 00:35:29,050
Nobody ever seems to mention it. It's just accepted that you never speak.

195
00:35:29,849 --> 00:35:37,050
You just listen in this country in the West. He was killed for greed. Foul greed when there's

196
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:42,329
quite enough for everybody. I don't care what your scruples are as to killing.

197
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:46,090
I will take the full burden. It feels really weird.

198
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:57,340
You know, on a second thought, no, I don't miss it. I don't, I don't really miss it.

199
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:03,030
Crips well enough. He's long past his prime, of course. I do miss it in some games, though.

200
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:08,869
Entirely crazy just yet. And he will help you better than most of his ilk. Crips.

201
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:17,480
Get up. Hello, partner. Horley. This is your new boss. Oh, pleased to meet you, partner.

202
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:22,920
JB Crips at your service. Was that a sign of respect back then? Camp established. Mrs.

203
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,760
Leclerc is a generous. That's a complete reverse now. Where are we headed?

204
00:36:30,139 --> 00:36:34,219
All right. Where are we headed? I get to pick my select location for your camp.

205
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:39,179
Crips will set this up for you. A fee can be paid to move your camp again when you enter free

206
00:36:39,179 --> 00:36:55,579
room. Okay. Camp. View and change camp settings. Set camp location. Okay. So I just

207
00:36:55,579 --> 00:37:02,519
small camp. Daily fee is charged for camp maintenance. A small camp can hold between one

208
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:10,070
to four posse members. I can't do the larger. Well, large is $2. We're going to go to the Bayou.

209
00:37:10,869 --> 00:37:18,809
I think that's the only thing we can do. Yeah. Here comes level one. This is where we're going

210
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:25,900
to go. Oh, sir. While Crips is establishing your camp, perhaps you can go to the station

211
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:32,059
and see the clerk, then head to see Clay Davies. He's a horse thief and not a terribly nice

212
00:37:32,059 --> 00:37:45,719
one. Then meet Crips back at your camp. See you shortly, boss. Okay. Good luck. Pressing up

213
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:54,409
can be used to whistle for your horse. Yes. Just like in the other game. My horse is...

214
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:03,639
If you don't have any horses, this is your horse. Somebody just get five community subs.

215
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:13,900
Lightning Rider, thank you for the five community subs. Very generous of you.

216
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:25,340
Thank you so much. I got resubbed. Oh, there you go. You can thank Lightning Rider for that one.

217
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:33,539
Is this online? Oh, yeah. This is kind of like in GTA Online, where there was that initial...

218
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:38,179
You do the first couple of little missions and it teaches you how to play again,

219
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:46,260
sort of, and then the world opens up. So this is the... I got just a kind of shitty

220
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:55,659
horse. Got to go to the post office and find a new horse. I forgot how to play. So last night

221
00:38:55,659 --> 00:38:59,420
we played this for like a couple hours just so I could familiarize myself with Red Dead again

222
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:03,610
because I hadn't played it in a couple weeks. I didn't need to do that. The game just teaches

223
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:15,179
you how to play again in the first like 40 minutes of this. So am I in my own instance

224
00:39:15,179 --> 00:39:20,519
right now? Or are there other players? Like is it possible that I'm going to see a guy with

225
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:24,519
like a bear head on just like walking down the road throwing fucking grenades at people

226
00:39:24,519 --> 00:39:39,019
and stuff? You're on your own. Okay. Well, that's interesting. So it is just like the first

227
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:49,300
time they tried this in GTA Online. Red Dead 2. Find a train as soon as possible.

228
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:54,340
No, let me get out of this tutorial. I don't want to... I'm not going to go train myself.

229
00:39:56,119 --> 00:40:00,440
Free roam mission givers can be found across the map. The closest mission giver

230
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,920
will be shown on the radar when you enter free roam. So that is a free roam mission.

231
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:17,960
Okay. There's a rocket powered stage coach. Well, that sounds fucking fun.

232
00:40:32,969 --> 00:40:37,849
Everyone you see is a person. So this person is just doing a fantastic RP job.

233
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:52,599
You might want to earn a little money. Well, some gentlemen have been robbing our stages and

234
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:57,079
they are not part of the club. If you catch my meaning, if you can make them go away,

235
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:02,760
I'm sure they will have something of interest to you. They're up at blue water marsh.

236
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:11,159
I need to see what you can do. Okay. Here, by the way, a catalog, the latest issue just

237
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:16,199
came into this armpit from a land more civilized. And if all works out, well,

238
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:23,320
my colleagues and I move around these stations as needed. And all of us are very discouraged.

239
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:29,829
We will all help a fellow sufferer with pertinent information. Good afternoon, sir.

240
00:41:32,539 --> 00:41:42,360
Muppet with scally cap. God, I need to know this. It's the same person.

241
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:52,199
I think I, I'm pretty certain it was just a one-off Muppet from one of the random movies.

242
00:41:53,079 --> 00:42:04,710
No, it's not beaker. It's like, it was like a one-off Muppet. All right. So let's go to the

243
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:25,940
volume. I'll find it. I think this Muppet was only in like three scenes in the whole

244
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:31,619
movie. And that's the only time he was ever used. And I think he did talk like this too.

245
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:35,539
I think it just was that we made, I don't know. I'm subconsciously making characters

246
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:50,659
that are in my brain. Great Muppet caper. Oh, yeah. I think the person got it.

247
00:42:53,429 --> 00:43:12,630
Did you get it? I think it was. Is it the taxi driver? Yes.

248
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:18,860
You got him. You got him. All right. We have to watch this right now.

249
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:35,219
Yes, you got it. Wow. You found him. It's the taxi driver from the Great Muppet caper.

250
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:41,130
Hold on.

251
00:43:53,449 --> 00:43:57,849
Where is it? Where is it? Nice eyes. Sturdy legs. And it might have been my imagination,

252
00:43:57,849 --> 00:44:03,210
but I think she found me. Here he comes. Here he comes. Taxi. Where is he?

253
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:12,090
Runs in the family. Taxi. Taxi. I don't know why the cabs won't stop. Just leave it to me.

254
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:21,639
He's gonna, there he comes. Gonzo's gonna get him. Taxi. There he is. That's very effective.

255
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:35,349
That's it. That's it. It's the only time he was ever used.

256
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:50,550
How and why do, I don't know. I just, I remembered, but the best part about it is

257
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:57,030
who said that? That person deserves an accolade right now.

258
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:14,219
Oh, I did. Oh no. I forgot. I can't say that. Oh, that's so funny. That was,

259
00:45:14,219 --> 00:45:18,139
guys, I'm gonna be completely honest with you. That was going to drive me

260
00:45:19,369 --> 00:45:28,099
fucking crazy. I was going to sit here for probably, even after the stream is over,

261
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:38,070
in bed, lying down, at dinner. It would not have left me. Nobody help him next time. What,

262
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:59,829
you want me to like suffer? Streamer lies down at dinner. Moses, his name was the meme goblin.

263
00:45:59,829 --> 00:46:22,760
So that was his name? All right. Search for the hideout. All right. Search, where is it?

264
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:27,159
Gang hideouts may appear across free roam. Enemies at these hideouts can be looted for cash

265
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:36,150
and other items. Okay. Something about this music is, something about this music is weirding

266
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:54,780
me out. Let's try to be a little bit stealthy about this. He dropped his gun to pull a different

267
00:46:54,780 --> 00:47:03,050
one out. He was holding a toy. Oh, a guy's here. I'm going to pick up a real gun.

268
00:47:03,849 --> 00:47:26,010
I'm doing pretty good. A whole squad. These guys are all in a party together.

269
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:40,010
Look at that. I, what do I get for doing that? 1800s Stormtroopers.

270
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:51,110
Oh, got another RP here. Our role player.

271
00:48:01,269 --> 00:48:03,909
All right. The world will be influenced by your honor. Spare the banner in order to increase

272
00:48:03,909 --> 00:48:10,869
your honor or kill them to lower it. I don't have my mic plugged in. So I am just like

273
00:48:10,869 --> 00:48:22,659
the silent protagonist. No, I'm going to spare him. The Muppet taxi driver is a good guy.

274
00:48:22,739 --> 00:48:38,599
Okay. Yes, I did try to punch him in the face. So you've just received a treasure map.

275
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:42,469
Hold, uh, to open your satchel and select the treasure map.

276
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:52,360
You're gonna go, are we going on a treasure hunt? Okay. Now install your rifle. I got

277
00:48:52,360 --> 00:49:02,969
my rifle. I'm fine. Search this area here. Okay. For the treasure. I'm going to assume

278
00:49:02,969 --> 00:49:15,079
this is how you make money in this game. That would make some sense, right? I'm online

279
00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:23,989
now, man. So money is valuable. Items are valuable. Where did this guy go? Down here?

280
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:34,730
That was a real person. All right. Sure. Sierra for the treasure. Let's get back on the

281
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:49,139
horse. I have to go up here. Oh, by the way, it's been nearly 50 minutes so far streaming

282
00:49:49,139 --> 00:49:55,780
and I have not fallen off the horse once. So that's a new record. It actually might be.

283
00:49:56,969 --> 00:50:01,929
Anybody know if that's like actually a new record of not smashing into a tree or a rock

284
00:50:01,929 --> 00:50:37,750
after 30, 40, 50 straight minutes? Emote. Emote wheel. Oh my God. Search the area. So

285
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:44,949
when does this actually come out? It's currently in beta, right? When does this actually release?

286
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:52,889
For real? Not like, oh, open the beta up. Is this closing in a couple of days? And then

287
00:50:52,889 --> 00:51:02,710
coming back a month later or something? It's always going to be a beta. Wait,

288
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:11,670
I want to emote on this guy. I'm going to emote all up in this guy's face. I can't go. Oops.

289
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:25,059
I didn't fall off the horse. That doesn't count. So that's a west range. No, come on, man.

290
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:31,829
That is a really weird way to do that. So it's, you have to lock onto somebody.

291
00:51:31,829 --> 00:52:09,099
R2, L, L, R1, R1 again for the wheel. Wave. No, he's not listening. R1, R2, square,

292
00:52:09,099 --> 00:52:13,420
R1, then press R2. Kind of running out of buttons on the controller it seems.

293
00:52:16,329 --> 00:52:25,289
Yeah, it's L2, R1, and then R1 if you want to change something. So it's L2, L2, R1, triangle.

294
00:52:29,099 --> 00:52:39,059
Let's find that treasure. It's an eagle eye. Let's get off the horse. Well, I don't even,

295
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:44,710
why would I need to use eagle eye? Here it is. There's going to be money in here, right?

296
00:52:45,269 --> 00:53:00,889
There's a brick. Ability card voucher. What? Gold bars can be used to purchase or unlock certain

297
00:53:00,889 --> 00:53:06,570
items early. Once you own a hundred gold nuggets, these will automatically turn to a gold bar.

298
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:09,449
Shop items become unlocked as your rank increases. You can see your rank unlocks and

299
00:53:17,059 --> 00:53:19,619
cash can be used to purchase a range of products and services.

300
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:26,150
So there's a current, there's a, there's an in-game currency and then a currency.

301
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:34,170
So there's money and then like MOBA gems. You've discovered an ability card.

302
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:41,909
Coupons can be redeemed to acquire your first ability card. They can be purchased and equipped

303
00:53:41,909 --> 00:53:52,329
to offer certain boosts in combat situations. The triangle is the ability loadout. Select to

304
00:53:52,329 --> 00:54:02,550
equip an active ability card in this slot. Okay, so this is, this is my dead eye,

305
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:06,869
these are my dead eye abilities. While dead eye is active, you slowly regenerate health.

306
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:15,320
Okay. While dead eye is active, you and your team members deal a little bit more damage. If more

307
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:19,159
than one member of your team has an, has this ability active, the effects do not stack.

308
00:54:21,699 --> 00:54:31,610
You can paint targets onto enemies. I mean that's, that's pretty good. Yeah, taking

309
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:48,949
this one. Paint it black. You can upgrade it. It has its own experience. That's odd. Okay,

310
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:54,340
that's just normal dead eye. I mean I, I like the normal dead eye.

311
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:07,190
You now have a dead eye card. When aiming, press R3 to enter dead eye and use the card's

312
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:11,989
effects. Some cards require a weapon to be equipped. Yeah, now that would make sense.

313
00:55:14,809 --> 00:55:26,179
Almost fell, but it didn't. Opens treasure chest. Cool. Four dollars.

314
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:39,980
Story mission. So what's considered a lot of money in Red Dead Online? 100 bucks, 50 bucks,

315
00:55:47,079 --> 00:55:54,539
50 dollars? No, no, no. Forget about the guy that already broke into the game's data files

316
00:55:54,539 --> 00:55:58,219
and gave himself like 50 trillion dollars. I'm talking about like for real,

317
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:12,650
for real video game, in-game currency-wise. Is it the cost of the game? 59.99? Now that would

318
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:26,230
be fun. If it was 60 bucks and that was like expensive. Some of the horses go for 60

319
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:37,909
gold bars, which is that's 600 or six. What's the nugget to bar conversion? Is it 101 or

320
00:56:37,909 --> 00:56:57,000
a thousand to one? Is it 101? Don't. We're good. Four dollars is probably a steak dinner.

321
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:12,019
Clay Davies is far away, ain't he? Jesus, Jerma, if you don't know the nugget to bar

322
00:57:12,019 --> 00:57:18,280
conversion, you will never make it to the finals. I'll make it to the finals just based

323
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:31,349
on my pure skill shot. I don't need to, look, I don't need to understand. I just need to do,

324
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:43,849
right? I don't, okay, if you want to take the the basketball or baseball sports thing,

325
00:57:43,849 --> 00:57:50,179
right? I don't even need to know how the game works. The goal is put that ball into

326
00:57:50,179 --> 00:57:58,420
the basket and just don't cross this line when you do it. Okay, if I can get a swish every

327
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:02,900
single fucking time, no matter what happens, that's all I need to know. And I could get

328
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:06,659
that 50 million dollar contract just based on getting the ball in the hoop, even if I don't

329
00:58:06,659 --> 00:58:25,000
know how to play the game. Start matchmaking for other players. I guess, I guess we're going

330
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:37,099
to find players. Is this the same streamer that made kids toys while eating pizza? Yep.

331
00:58:40,889 --> 00:58:49,289
Game start. Players one out of one. Harley suggested that you go to see Clay Davies,

332
00:58:49,289 --> 00:58:53,699
a horse thief, to learn the ins and outs of the horse rustling trade. All right,

333
00:58:53,699 --> 00:59:06,809
I guess I'm just gonna ready up. Weapon loadout. All right. Honor among horse thieves.

334
00:59:13,739 --> 00:59:22,380
Clive and Clay. Somebody already wanted to skip it. What? Skip the cutscene?

335
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:39,340
I want to see. I want to know what happens. Somebody in the party is just like, I don't

336
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:45,260
give a shit about any of this. I just want to drop dynamite in the middle of the team

337
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:46,380
right when we start the mission.

338
00:59:55,420 --> 01:00:07,179
Oh, one out of four. Red dead players have ADHD. Sorry. It's probably three out of four.

339
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:16,460
Because guess what? I have it. And if you think that that guy has it, that's at least two out

340
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:32,059
of four. At least. All right, so go to the mill. Take it back to the horse thieves at

341
01:00:32,059 --> 01:00:43,860
Rhodes and bring it to him at St. Dennis. So this is the squad, huh? This already feels

342
01:00:44,420 --> 01:01:02,550
like a ju- wait, what? I can- is this gonna hurt him? Can I- I can jump on his horse. Okay.

343
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:10,869
That's interesting. All right, that was actually kind of cool. I want to know how fast you

344
01:01:10,869 --> 01:01:16,469
can go and do that. All right, speed up. Get us up there so I can- I want to get

345
01:01:16,469 --> 01:01:21,820
to the first place. I want to live vicariously through the person in first place by jumping

346
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:37,460
on their horse. How do I emote? All right, we need to steal a horse. Am I slowing the

347
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:43,880
horse down? I probably am. All right, so we get to steal the horse. Uh, this guy- this

348
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:57,050
guy is just kind of running in. How did that- what? How did that horse- no- oh god,

349
01:01:57,050 --> 01:02:09,159
you just already did that, really? Oh my god. No, I want to shoot this guy. Give him cover.

350
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:22,869
It's exactly what I thought it was gonna be. This is the first mission, too. All right,

351
01:02:22,869 --> 01:02:39,269
we gotta get a horse. Did I shoot the horse? All right, and he's- wait, which horse am I?

352
01:02:39,269 --> 01:02:42,710
Wait, I'm in here first. Red. No. Blue. No, no, no, no. Which one do I want?

353
01:02:43,349 --> 01:02:57,260
This one. Let's go. I already didn't get one. How did he- did he not get a- who didn't

354
01:02:57,260 --> 01:03:05,449
get a horse yet? Which one of my crew members? Why are we not together?

355
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:17,380
Somebody died. Who died? What is- this guy didn't have a horse yet. Go get a horse!

356
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:23,130
No, I don't want that person- I have to help because that- somebody needs to go get their

357
01:03:23,130 --> 01:03:43,880
horse. Oh well. What the fuck was that? All right, take the horse in the stable.

358
01:03:45,000 --> 01:04:05,420
All right, I gotta get real close. Whoa! Are we waiting for the last person? Um,

359
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:16,900
excuse me. Excuse me. What? Where's our last guy? What's he doing all the way over there?

360
01:04:17,699 --> 01:04:22,539
That guy- we- everyone shot that guy. Four hats came out of that guy.

361
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:38,789
He disappeared and he turned to the hats. Um, why are we standing here? Is there a reason

362
01:04:38,789 --> 01:04:49,369
for this? Why can I not shoot? Okay, that was really weird. Leave him. Don't we have to

363
01:04:49,369 --> 01:05:14,519
finish the mission together? You fucking asshole! You dick! That doesn't count. I was

364
01:05:14,519 --> 01:05:25,340
intentionally sabotaged. I ran into him. He stopped- no, he stopped in the middle of the

365
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:33,420
road. He just went- he did that on purpose. He was trying to- he was making like a

366
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:47,130
compilation video. Now I'm in it. I get to be in it now. The funniest part about this,

367
01:05:47,130 --> 01:05:53,960
is this still a guy that just rode down there to the west? I don't think that- that

368
01:05:54,119 --> 01:06:07,900
guy- I don't think that guy knows what's going on. Did that person's horse die? Don't stop short

369
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:37,420
again. I got a horse. Mets. Some kind of suicide squad. I got to rank three.

370
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:46,980
The good thing about this, I'm happy that we all don't have to complete it. Just, we can't have two

371
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:54,380
people die. That guy just took off into the wilderness and started hunting.

372
01:07:12,199 --> 01:07:18,840
I call him boy because I'm older. 30 minutes, he went black. Let's give our friend here back the

373
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:25,000
horse. Hey, thanks. It's yours. A sign of faith and future business. If you want to buy any

374
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:30,599
extras or sundries for the animal, head inside. Sundry? They've got a lot available. What's a

375
01:07:30,599 --> 01:07:58,820
sundry? See you soon. Dude's face. What the fuck? All right, so services.

376
01:08:02,519 --> 01:08:20,060
Rename the horse. I can't. Horse insurance. I guess just get it. Rename horse. How about-

377
01:08:21,020 --> 01:09:00,600
uh, it can't be Phil. It's got to be something better than that. How about- I just used all my

378
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:17,369
money. That was seven dollars and fifty cents. I forgot I was online. I- I- this is just something

379
01:09:17,369 --> 01:09:20,890
I just do in the regular game. I just buy it every time because I haven't bought a ton of

380
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:35,220
money. All right, whatever. Empty slot. I guess this is just free. Improved. Um, it's just

381
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:42,340
stock. Saddle voucher. All right, saddle bags. This is going to cost money, isn't it?

382
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:52,859
That's 80 bucks. Look at this shit. 22 dollars. Not enough. Buy now with one gold.

383
01:09:57,979 --> 01:10:07,399
This shit ain't even worth it. Drain rate. It's- you just- you're paying- all you're paying for

384
01:10:08,119 --> 01:10:16,090
is to get that 10% drain rate. The- the- you're not even- you can't even see that

385
01:10:16,090 --> 01:10:24,539
from more than three or four feet away. So if you want to pay for a drain rate decrease,

386
01:10:26,439 --> 01:10:39,399
buy a hundred gold packs on the- no. Absolutely not. Uh, we're just gonna do- just gonna do

387
01:10:39,399 --> 01:10:54,039
default. Just buy the super horse. 21. No, that's too much money. Core drain. Oh, whatever.

388
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:57,880
I don't think I can do anything about the- this is probably gonna cost money too. Yep.

389
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:01,640
No, I have to keep- I just do default. I can't do anything interesting

390
01:11:02,199 --> 01:11:10,069
because I need to buy a gun or something. Which version of the game is this? This is

391
01:11:10,069 --> 01:11:14,739
the special edition. I didn't buy the ultimate edition because I didn't think it was worth it.

392
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:18,779
I didn't think it was- oh, whatever. I'll just get the- I'll get the one that you shouldn't

393
01:11:18,779 --> 01:11:24,550
buy. The one in the middle. And I couldn't play yesterday. And I got like a cool horse

394
01:11:24,550 --> 01:11:36,170
in the main game. All right, that's good. So am I in the open world now? You've

395
01:11:36,170 --> 01:11:39,529
bonded with your horse after purchasing a saddle for it. Your horse is indicated by- yep,

396
01:11:39,529 --> 01:11:53,880
yep, yep. V at the camp. See, I got the cool one. Knowing Rockstar, they'll be flying

397
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:59,380
horses soon. Yeah, if you want- look, if you want to play Red Dead Redemption,

398
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:04,579
and you want to play it at its very pure core, you gotta play within the next- I would say

399
01:12:04,579 --> 01:12:09,699
within the next couple months. Because after a year of content updates, it's gonna feel like

400
01:12:09,699 --> 01:12:15,609
steampunk in this game. It'll be like astronaut helmets, there'll be spaceships and shit.

401
01:12:18,729 --> 01:12:21,289
Extra stalls can be purchased in the stables, these allow you to buy and manage

402
01:12:21,289 --> 01:12:30,810
additional horses, right? If you want the real Red Dead Redemption 2 online experience,

403
01:12:31,609 --> 01:12:40,180
I would- I would get involved in the next couple months. Before the guy that has $500,000

404
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:47,220
that just sends horses with like C4 attached to like blow up everybody standing in free

405
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:53,399
realm. That's not- that doesn't exist right now. It will. It's gonna happen.

406
01:12:54,359 --> 01:13:07,130
Once people are able to battlefield people in this game, now I'm just shilling for Red Dead

407
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:11,850
On- no, no! I'm telling you, play it now. Don't play it later. Guess I am telling you

408
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:29,050
to buy it, am I? Yeah, I guess I am saying that. All right. Well, okay, for a second,

409
01:13:29,050 --> 01:13:35,859
I was like, who the fuck is Sean and why are they in my game? Do you really need me to tell

410
01:13:35,859 --> 01:13:41,859
you to buy Red Dead Redemption 2? Do I have to say that? Isn't it very obvious that this game

411
01:13:41,859 --> 01:13:48,579
is worth playing? I gotta be careful with what I say about one of the best open world games

412
01:13:48,579 --> 01:13:51,699
probably to come out in five to ten years. No, I gotta be careful!

413
01:14:01,939 --> 01:14:02,500
Not really.

414
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:08,500
Think you did a good job for you? I'll earn my keep. When you get too old to fight,

415
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:13,539
what choice have you got? It's either work or beg. I'd rather work.

416
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:21,140
Now, he wants you to come down and meet him in Blackwater when you get a chance.

417
01:14:21,699 --> 01:14:27,300
I think he might have some work for you. And while you're out on your travels,

418
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:33,859
you may see some folk with employment opportunities. Good folk, bad folk. Well,

419
01:14:33,859 --> 01:14:37,140
should I? Hey, you decide if you want to purchase something or not.

420
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:43,140
Up to you if you listen to them. I will always tell you what I don't like.

421
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:52,819
This guy's beard is just frozen boogers. That's all it is. He's never wiped it off.

422
01:14:58,390 --> 01:15:08,119
In probably two or three decades. General stores and tailors with supplies and clothing.

423
01:15:08,119 --> 01:15:11,560
Here you go. Welcome to GTA Red Dead Online.

424
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:19,460
Find and accept free row missions from various characters like this guy.

425
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:20,739
Or this guy.

426
01:15:22,279 --> 01:15:25,239
Or counter a rival player's mission for your own reward.

427
01:15:25,239 --> 01:15:28,819
No. Really? Hold on. What?

428
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:33,180
Did they just say please grief everybody that's playing the game?

429
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:46,539
Hahaha. Hey, if somebody's trying to do a mission, fuck them up intentionally

430
01:15:46,539 --> 01:15:50,380
by flying a fucking flying horse into the train in front of their mission.

431
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:51,420
You'll get rewarded for it.

432
01:15:53,109 --> 01:15:55,189
I guess the whole game is about being like an outlaw.

433
01:15:55,189 --> 01:15:56,949
So that doesn't go out of the ordinary.

434
01:15:57,909 --> 01:16:02,739
Player many is used to this and receive invites.

435
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:09,779
Okay, I can either quick join. Ooh, I got a trophy.

436
01:16:10,819 --> 01:16:12,579
You join or invite players.

437
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:19,510
Oh, MLC still is not playing this game.

438
01:16:27,029 --> 01:16:34,899
Let's see. He has friends. Yeah, like one.

439
01:16:35,939 --> 01:16:39,140
So I guess just join, view and invite. Quick join.

440
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:42,659
Join a series or story. Wait, wait, wait. Not yet. Wait a minute.

441
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:46,899
Camp's white flag is raised protecting you from other players.

442
01:16:46,899 --> 01:16:49,300
Focus on the flag or use the player menu to lower it.

443
01:16:51,319 --> 01:16:53,399
The camp's white flag is raised.

444
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:55,960
So that means nobody can come in here.

445
01:16:56,680 --> 01:17:01,210
So this is where you're safe. As long as I have the flag raised.

446
01:17:02,090 --> 01:17:03,560
Oh, they're okay over here.

447
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:10,329
Lower the flag. Lower the flag.

448
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:13,109
Let them come.

449
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:17,220
Some items can be purchased through the catalog.

450
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:20,409
You have a new person.

451
01:17:21,210 --> 01:17:22,010
That is uh-oh.

452
01:17:25,210 --> 01:17:26,970
All right, let's open the handheld menu.

453
01:17:27,609 --> 01:17:35,510
Hunting and fishing horses. So this is just the web.

454
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:37,270
Okay, so you can buy. I can just buy this from here.

455
01:17:38,470 --> 01:17:43,670
That's cool. How much is a bow?

456
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:48,489
124 dollars.

457
01:17:52,819 --> 01:17:57,220
724 dollars? Why is it so- how much higher than that?

458
01:17:58,779 --> 01:18:00,140
900 dollars.

459
01:18:03,239 --> 01:18:10,630
Okay. Well, I used to do this when I was a kid.

460
01:18:10,630 --> 01:18:11,750
I was never going to get any of it.

461
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:14,390
But this is the equivalent of what I used to do.

462
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:15,909
I used to- okay, there used to be a-

463
01:18:17,449 --> 01:18:21,449
like a Macy's catalog or like a JCPenney catalog would come in.

464
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:25,609
And there'd be a huge toy section.

465
01:18:25,609 --> 01:18:26,649
And I would just go through

466
01:18:26,649 --> 01:18:28,890
and I would just circle all the toys that I ever wanted.

467
01:18:29,689 --> 01:18:34,579
And that's all I can do.

468
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:37,460
Oh god damn it. Hold on.

469
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:46,840
How do I like turn that off?

470
01:18:57,739 --> 01:18:58,779
This is not going to stop.

471
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:01,720
Notification settings.

472
01:19:08,489 --> 01:19:09,930
That's just- it's just going.

473
01:19:09,930 --> 01:19:11,289
I thought I already had that set.

474
01:19:13,859 --> 01:19:14,739
Notifications.

475
01:19:19,479 --> 01:19:20,439
Notification settings.

476
01:19:20,439 --> 01:19:21,479
I thought I already had it off.

477
01:19:21,479 --> 01:19:22,680
Yeah, pop up notifications.

478
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:25,180
No, no. Just disable.

479
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:28,380
No notifications. Absolutely none of them at all.

480
01:19:28,380 --> 01:19:32,020
I think I got it.

481
01:19:32,659 --> 01:19:37,109
Are we good?

482
01:19:37,109 --> 01:19:37,670
I think so.

483
01:19:38,310 --> 01:19:39,689
We're good.

484
01:19:39,689 --> 01:19:40,250
All right, we're back.

485
01:19:47,510 --> 01:19:51,420
Okay, so let's just- just take a look.

486
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:55,060
I should probably put this back up, shouldn't I?

487
01:19:55,779 --> 01:19:57,460
Just hit- that's the wrong button.

488
01:19:58,260 --> 01:19:59,939
And I don't want to run the ammo in this game.

489
01:19:59,939 --> 01:20:00,899
Raise it. Raise it.

490
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:04,170
So I can't wait to get chased by somebody

491
01:20:04,170 --> 01:20:06,649
and then stand behind here and just point and be like,

492
01:20:07,449 --> 01:20:08,489
you can't get me.

493
01:20:09,449 --> 01:20:12,090
Like the guy that drives over the Mexican border

494
01:20:12,090 --> 01:20:13,689
at the end of the action movie.

495
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:16,409
And there's a- there's a confrontation between the-

496
01:20:16,409 --> 01:20:18,250
like the cop and the bad guy.

497
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:19,689
And like I can't do anything about you.

498
01:20:20,569 --> 01:20:22,439
I can't wait to have one of those scenarios.

499
01:20:29,590 --> 01:20:30,149
One more.

500
01:20:30,710 --> 01:20:31,430
Give me one more.

501
01:20:31,989 --> 01:20:34,329
Continue playing to access your bonus content.

502
01:20:35,050 --> 01:20:36,869
You made that joke.

503
01:20:37,510 --> 01:20:38,010
When?

504
01:20:39,770 --> 01:20:40,090
When?

505
01:20:40,090 --> 01:20:40,970
What was the scenario?

506
01:20:41,689 --> 01:20:47,399
You already made- but when?

507
01:20:47,399 --> 01:20:48,439
When did I make the reference?

508
01:20:49,079 --> 01:20:50,859
Does anyone remember what game it was?

509
01:21:00,409 --> 01:21:04,439
50- 50,000.

510
01:21:04,439 --> 01:21:05,239
Oh, okay.

511
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:08,359
All right.

512
01:21:08,359 --> 01:21:13,960
First- I thought somebody just gave $50,000 to the stream.

513
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:15,159
And I was like, no, they didn't.

514
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:18,010
I was like, no, fucking what?

515
01:21:19,579 --> 01:21:20,779
Everybody freaked the fuck out.

516
01:21:20,779 --> 01:21:22,140
I see 50k.

517
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:22,779
50k.

518
01:21:22,779 --> 01:21:24,300
I'm like, no, what happened to 50,000?

519
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:24,779
What happened?

520
01:21:24,779 --> 01:21:25,819
Do I have to- what happened to it?

521
01:21:29,319 --> 01:21:30,760
No, it's just fucking seagulls.

522
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:33,880
It's just a bot that was there.

523
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:36,819
All right, let's go do a mission.

524
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:38,869
Let's go.

525
01:21:38,869 --> 01:21:39,430
I'm gonna- wait.

526
01:21:41,609 --> 01:21:43,689
Don't dream so high, man.

527
01:21:44,890 --> 01:21:45,770
I'm not- no.

528
01:21:45,770 --> 01:21:47,130
I just freaked out for a second.

529
01:21:48,170 --> 01:21:48,489
Okay.

530
01:21:49,930 --> 01:21:51,689
There are almost 4,000 people here, right?

531
01:21:51,689 --> 01:21:54,409
When, like, the chat blows up like that, and I just see 50k.

532
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:55,130
50k.

533
01:21:55,130 --> 01:21:57,130
And a ton of, like, fucking pog champs.

534
01:21:58,170 --> 01:21:58,810
Is this a player?

535
01:21:59,689 --> 01:22:07,859
I mean, I- what am I supposed to think?

536
01:22:07,859 --> 01:22:08,979
I'm like, 50,000 what?

537
01:22:09,779 --> 01:22:12,739
And then my brain said, wait, 50- everyone's freaking out.

538
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:19,500
You didn't think I was gonna do it!

539
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:20,699
You didn't think I was gonna be able to get it,

540
01:22:20,699 --> 01:22:21,180
but I got it.

541
01:22:21,739 --> 01:22:26,600
This is gonna impede me.

542
01:22:27,239 --> 01:22:32,010
I need to just get into, like, a lobby.

543
01:22:32,649 --> 01:22:36,460
Have I used any microtransactions?

544
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:37,579
No, not yet.

545
01:22:37,579 --> 01:22:43,670
I just want to jump over this.

546
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:45,239
No.

547
01:22:45,239 --> 01:22:45,880
No, I didn't do it.

548
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:46,680
Do I- did I do it?

549
01:22:47,479 --> 01:22:49,399
I did.

550
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:52,199
Yeah, I did.

551
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:53,699
Oops.

552
01:22:53,699 --> 01:22:54,260
No, we're fine.

553
01:22:57,260 --> 01:22:58,220
Not yet.

554
01:22:58,220 --> 01:22:58,699
Well, no.

555
01:22:58,699 --> 01:22:59,819
Not yet as in no.

556
01:22:59,819 --> 01:23:00,779
Not ever.

557
01:23:00,779 --> 01:23:02,060
I should have been more clear.

558
01:23:02,779 --> 01:23:10,180
I'm not gonna buy gold bars.

559
01:23:10,979 --> 01:23:16,250
If I was gonna spend $100 in this game and buy gold bars,

560
01:23:19,180 --> 01:23:19,979
I would- no.

561
01:23:19,979 --> 01:23:23,420
I would just- I would go take that money to the casino

562
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:25,020
and just put it on double zero.

563
01:23:25,819 --> 01:23:27,260
Because, hey, guess what?

564
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:31,500
There's a small chance that I just made, like, 35 fucking hundred dollars.

565
01:23:32,380 --> 01:23:37,029
Oh, there are players here.

566
01:23:39,189 --> 01:23:39,590
Really?

567
01:23:39,590 --> 01:23:39,829
Okay.

568
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:43,210
I see the little blips on the map.

569
01:23:43,210 --> 01:23:43,689
Where are they?

570
01:23:44,329 --> 01:23:47,420
Are they only on the minimap or are they on the large map?

571
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:49,060
Ooh, okay, hold on.

572
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:50,100
There's a person here.

573
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:51,430
Okay.

574
01:23:52,069 --> 01:23:58,180
Kill them.

575
01:23:58,180 --> 01:23:58,420
No.

576
01:23:59,899 --> 01:24:03,020
I'm not gonna start the never-ending cycle of Rockstar

577
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:04,619
online game insanity.

578
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:10,460
If I shoot this guy, it will never end because even if I leave,

579
01:24:11,020 --> 01:24:13,819
I'm gonna shoot this guy and then I'm gonna leave.

580
01:24:13,819 --> 01:24:16,939
This guy's gonna be angry and he's gonna shoot the guy that's next to him down there.

581
01:24:16,939 --> 01:24:19,500
That guy's gonna get angry and shoot the guy that spawns next to him.

582
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:21,340
It's never going to end the cycle.

583
01:24:21,340 --> 01:24:22,220
It stops here.

584
01:24:22,220 --> 01:24:22,939
I'm not doing it.

585
01:24:56,789 --> 01:24:57,430
What was that?

586
01:24:58,069 --> 01:25:01,159
How do I do the mission?

587
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:06,470
I just started the cycle and now the cycle is never gonna break.

588
01:25:07,189 --> 01:25:12,199
Where's this mission?

589
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:26,119
And you see, I shot that guy.

590
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:30,550
That guy shot somebody else and then that person went into another game.

591
01:25:31,590 --> 01:25:37,369
Fuck this and shot somebody else and then eventually it kept going

592
01:25:39,050 --> 01:25:43,659
and eventually they got to a point where somebody shot the server.

593
01:25:48,069 --> 01:26:02,140
Uh, all right, just go to free room if I can even get in.

594
01:26:02,859 --> 01:26:10,439
Yeah, somebody in game ran around and they found the box

595
01:26:11,239 --> 01:26:12,869
that's plugged in.

596
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:17,699
That's the way that they get to have all the servers open.

597
01:26:17,699 --> 01:26:19,460
That guy just shot the fucking router in the game.

598
01:26:30,729 --> 01:26:33,689
This dead worked, but what if I did just get banned?

599
01:26:35,319 --> 01:26:35,960
Imagine that.

600
01:26:43,989 --> 01:26:47,510
That's a fault on Rockstar for putting the router in the game.

601
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:55,659
True talk, is this really good?

602
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:57,899
I don't, I don't know.

603
01:26:57,899 --> 01:26:58,779
I didn't really get to play it.

604
01:27:01,529 --> 01:27:02,729
Oh God, really?

605
01:27:04,649 --> 01:27:07,529
Due to a fault on Rockstar game services.

606
01:27:08,250 --> 01:27:11,989
What does that code mean?

607
01:27:12,789 --> 01:27:21,350
Hold on, is it just off?

608
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:26,859
Banned?

609
01:27:27,579 --> 01:27:28,380
Banned.

610
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:29,819
No, I'm not banned.

611
01:27:29,819 --> 01:27:33,340
The server, somebody fucking unplug the server in Rhodes Ranch.

612
01:27:37,689 --> 01:27:38,810
Uh, let's see.

613
01:27:38,810 --> 01:27:43,859
Oh, we got a fix for it apparently.

614
01:27:44,420 --> 01:27:48,710
There's an easy fix for this problem.

615
01:27:51,770 --> 01:28:00,220
Uh, back out of the menu by pressing the button and attempt to relaunch Red Dead Online.

616
01:28:00,779 --> 01:28:03,180
Quit out of Red Dead and reboot the game.

617
01:28:04,140 --> 01:28:07,850
Okay, so I have to reboot the game.

618
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:10,260
Hopefully that fixes it.

619
01:28:12,869 --> 01:28:14,149
Wait an hour or two.

620
01:28:14,949 --> 01:28:18,260
No, I'm not going to wait an hour or two.

621
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:26,180
See, I fucking told you that I shot that guy and it started a cycle of hatred.

622
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:29,060
And that's the, and eventually it got disconnected.

623
01:28:29,060 --> 01:28:30,979
I got disconnected somehow.

624
01:28:31,619 --> 01:28:43,369
All right, I'm going to restart the game, see if it works.

625
01:28:43,930 --> 01:28:51,260
Somebody tries to find the root of the problem and I was the root of the problem.

626
01:29:07,319 --> 01:29:08,520
That guy was the server.

627
01:29:10,390 --> 01:29:11,270
You guys don't understand.

628
01:29:11,989 --> 01:29:15,619
When I say, oh, somebody must have shot the server in the game.

629
01:29:15,619 --> 01:29:16,739
That's like, that's what I did.

630
01:29:18,069 --> 01:29:21,029
NPCs in this game are, it's a network.

631
01:29:22,739 --> 01:29:26,390
Certain NPCs need to be left completely untouched.

632
01:29:26,390 --> 01:29:29,270
Because they're the ones that are directly, they're making the whole thing work.

633
01:29:29,909 --> 01:29:41,380
Let's try it again.

634
01:29:41,380 --> 01:29:41,779
Here we go.

635
01:29:42,970 --> 01:29:44,970
Are we going to get the same error?

636
01:29:46,439 --> 01:29:47,640
That was the test you failed.

637
01:29:48,539 --> 01:29:48,939
Damn it.

638
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:51,800
And I said it too.

639
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:56,199
I said, no, it's going to cause a cycle of bullshit and hatred

640
01:29:56,199 --> 01:29:57,239
and it's going to disconnect people.

641
01:29:57,239 --> 01:29:58,840
People are going to get angry, disconnect from the game.

642
01:29:58,840 --> 01:29:59,640
And then, no, fuck this game.

643
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:00,840
I'm not playing this game ever again.

644
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:22,229
Do I like these loading screens more compared to GTA V?

645
01:30:23,270 --> 01:30:24,149
Yeah, probably.

646
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:30,939
Mainly because the GTA V one was a static image that just changed to,

647
01:30:30,939 --> 01:30:32,460
it was like the same three images.

648
01:30:33,180 --> 01:30:41,210
I mean, these are also the same few images, but it's a little more muted.

649
01:30:42,010 --> 01:30:43,369
And I don't know if this is going to work.

650
01:30:44,710 --> 01:30:45,210
Ooh.

651
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:47,220
Mmm.

652
01:30:48,239 --> 01:30:57,720
Server booting back up.

653
01:30:57,720 --> 01:30:58,279
Initiate it.

654
01:30:59,159 --> 01:31:02,539
Come on.

655
01:31:02,539 --> 01:31:03,180
Let me back in.

656
01:31:03,819 --> 01:31:11,439
Can you continue playing?

657
01:31:11,439 --> 01:31:11,920
Got it.

658
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:12,420
Eat.

659
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:20,140
Where the hell am I?

660
01:31:20,140 --> 01:31:21,659
See, I think you're good.

661
01:31:21,659 --> 01:31:25,340
A rockstar dev definitely just was like, the cycle ends here and is disconnected.

662
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:29,180
He ripped out all the cords and then everybody now has to start fresh.

663
01:31:29,979 --> 01:31:39,119
There's my horse.

664
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:41,359
I want to go back over to that mission.

665
01:31:44,159 --> 01:31:45,439
Where the hell am I?

666
01:31:45,439 --> 01:31:46,239
Eats grass.

667
01:31:46,239 --> 01:31:47,680
Well, what if I was hungry?

668
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:51,319
All right, Sean.

669
01:31:52,460 --> 01:31:52,960
Let's go.

670
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:58,300
What was that?

671
01:32:00,670 --> 01:32:02,029
Oh, I thought it was a player.

672
01:32:02,029 --> 01:32:02,590
It was a player.

673
01:32:02,590 --> 01:32:03,149
I just saw a name.

674
01:32:09,479 --> 01:32:10,359
There was a name there.

675
01:32:10,359 --> 01:32:11,159
That's the crocodile.

676
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:14,010
The fuck is talking?

677
01:32:23,710 --> 01:32:24,670
Oh, that's me going.

678
01:32:24,670 --> 01:32:25,170
Yeah.

679
01:32:25,789 --> 01:32:30,560
All right, so I'm gonna be a good guy.

680
01:32:43,479 --> 01:32:46,600
Why am I having, I'm an unintentional bully.

681
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:47,880
I don't mean to do that.

682
01:32:49,659 --> 01:32:51,020
I don't, I didn't want to do that.

683
01:32:51,659 --> 01:33:01,579
No, this is nice.

684
01:33:01,579 --> 01:33:02,859
I like how this town is lit up at night.

685
01:33:03,579 --> 01:33:09,199
All right, so we got, we got the barbershop.

686
01:33:15,739 --> 01:33:17,020
Uh, what do you think?

687
01:33:17,020 --> 01:33:17,979
I'll tell you what I think.

688
01:33:17,979 --> 01:33:18,479
Let's see.

689
01:33:21,119 --> 01:33:22,239
Nice haircut.

690
01:33:22,239 --> 01:33:25,640
Is this your horse?

691
01:33:26,359 --> 01:33:28,859
What is your horse?

692
01:33:34,170 --> 01:33:35,130
Don't crash the server.

693
01:33:35,130 --> 01:33:36,810
You're gonna crash the server.

694
01:33:36,810 --> 01:33:43,390
The cycle, the cycle never ends.

695
01:33:44,479 --> 01:33:47,359
I told you guys, that person did the same thing I did.

696
01:33:48,079 --> 01:33:49,439
The same exact thing.

697
01:33:50,489 --> 01:33:51,850
And it starts over again.

698
01:33:52,649 --> 01:33:54,090
Rockstar, unplug it again.

699
01:33:54,090 --> 01:33:55,529
We need to start over.

700
01:33:55,529 --> 01:34:07,609
And I will continue to restart and reimagine and originate the human species until you learn.

701
01:34:08,859 --> 01:34:09,899
Get along.

702
01:34:09,899 --> 01:34:12,939
That's what we don't, we're in like a fucking weird post-apocalyptic movie.

703
01:34:20,409 --> 01:34:20,970
Where's my horse?

704
01:34:20,970 --> 01:34:23,130
Can my horse be stolen or taken or killed or something?

705
01:34:23,770 --> 01:34:28,279
I think they're coming after me.

706
01:34:28,279 --> 01:34:32,220
This person, look, this person's just murdering people.

707
01:34:32,220 --> 01:34:34,859
See, I did it once and broke the server.

708
01:34:34,859 --> 01:34:37,420
But now it's time to get a little bit of revenge here, I think.

709
01:34:38,539 --> 01:34:43,130
The cycle repeats, the cycle repeats, the cycle repeats.

710
01:35:03,770 --> 01:35:04,649
All right, I got my revenge.

711
01:35:04,649 --> 01:35:05,210
I gotta get out of here.

712
01:35:10,350 --> 01:35:13,710
It's time to go do a mission with a bunch of friends.

713
01:35:16,729 --> 01:35:25,680
Okay, so this guy right here.

714
01:35:29,609 --> 01:35:31,210
Except caravan escort.

715
01:35:31,529 --> 01:35:34,010
Thinks he's some criminal mastermind these days.

716
01:35:34,970 --> 01:35:37,449
This is the last thing I need right now.

717
01:35:37,449 --> 01:35:38,890
Voice chat, how do I turn off voice chat?

718
01:35:40,890 --> 01:35:46,699
I'm guessing this ain't just a social call.

719
01:35:46,699 --> 01:35:47,260
Showdown.

720
01:35:48,220 --> 01:35:53,960
What are you ringing a bell?

721
01:35:54,920 --> 01:35:55,960
It's in the player menu.

722
01:35:57,319 --> 01:35:59,609
Who's ringing the thing?

723
01:36:01,279 --> 01:36:02,239
That's not the player menu.

724
01:36:03,979 --> 01:36:07,260
So am I right in thinking you're here for more of all the little masters?

725
01:36:07,260 --> 01:36:08,939
Online options, voice chat.

726
01:36:10,750 --> 01:36:11,470
No one.

727
01:36:11,869 --> 01:36:12,750
Friends only.

728
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:15,319
Walk styles.

729
01:36:16,359 --> 01:36:16,760
Crazy.

730
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:20,479
All right, now we're good.

731
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:26,939
Another one here for some money under the table, I assume.

732
01:36:26,939 --> 01:36:28,840
I'll take it.

733
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:31,239
Nope, got nothing for you, sunshine.

734
01:36:31,239 --> 01:36:31,640
No, what?

735
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:32,920
Oh, I'm so bored.

736
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:35,800
It's like being trapped in a picture frame.

737
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:38,119
Increase your chance at success by accepting free roam missions.

738
01:36:38,119 --> 01:36:39,079
They dropped off a note.

739
01:36:39,079 --> 01:36:40,680
Some job that needs doing.

740
01:36:41,399 --> 01:36:44,520
Whoever they are, not that I give a damn anymore.

741
01:36:45,079 --> 01:36:46,439
Oh, I'm so bored.

742
01:36:47,319 --> 01:36:48,600
It's like being trapped in a picture frame.

743
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:49,640
So I'm not allowed to do this?

744
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:50,439
I'm not cool enough?

745
01:36:50,439 --> 01:36:51,239
I don't have a big enough...

746
01:36:51,239 --> 01:36:52,600
They dropped off a note.

747
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:54,199
Some job that needs doing.

748
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:58,359
Whoever they are, not that I give a damn anymore.

749
01:36:58,359 --> 01:37:00,119
I need some people online.

750
01:37:01,789 --> 01:37:03,149
Accept Supply Wagon.

751
01:37:03,869 --> 01:37:05,069
What is he doing?

752
01:37:07,720 --> 01:37:08,359
Oh, okay.

753
01:37:12,189 --> 01:37:13,069
I'm not big enough.

754
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:15,000
All right.

755
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:18,199
Does this mean that other people are going to be in this game?

756
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:27,229
Deliver the supplies to Rhodes General Store.

757
01:37:28,189 --> 01:37:34,000
Take the supplies to the drop-off within the time limit to earn the full reward.

758
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,600
So people are going to sabotage me here.

759
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:37,600
I just got to go.

760
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:39,039
Maybe people aren't paying that much attention.

761
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:49,020
I just got to bring the wagon.

762
01:37:49,739 --> 01:37:54,750
And if anybody comes near me, rival players can attack the supplies.

763
01:37:57,399 --> 01:37:57,800
Right.

764
01:37:57,800 --> 01:37:59,079
No, this is great.

765
01:37:59,079 --> 01:37:59,319
Okay.

766
01:37:59,319 --> 01:38:01,479
Well, I know what you're doing down there.

767
01:38:02,619 --> 01:38:04,220
You just got the little pop-up window.

768
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:08,909
Jerma is delivering supplies.

769
01:38:09,710 --> 01:38:14,140
You should probably stomp him.

770
01:38:14,140 --> 01:38:16,680
Maybe they're too preoccupied.

771
01:38:19,229 --> 01:38:26,729
Maybe I'll just get this without any issue at all and I'll get the full one gold bar reward.

772
01:38:27,689 --> 01:38:33,640
Hey, this is great.

773
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:34,119
Look at this.

774
01:38:36,010 --> 01:38:38,699
I just get to drive it for free.

775
01:38:39,659 --> 01:38:40,939
No one's going to stop me.

776
01:38:40,939 --> 01:38:41,819
No one can stop me.

777
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:52,079
I've won.

778
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:59,449
Am I even in a game with anybody anymore?

779
01:39:00,010 --> 01:39:07,050
What?

780
01:39:07,050 --> 01:39:23,239
What can I shoot?

781
01:39:24,039 --> 01:39:24,439
Shoot him.

782
01:39:25,319 --> 01:39:25,960
Shoot the gun.

783
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:27,079
What are you fucking doing?

784
01:39:28,119 --> 01:39:28,600
What?

785
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:31,000
I can't shoot that way.

786
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:32,840
I can't shoot the gun that way.

787
01:39:35,500 --> 01:39:36,699
This is not a player.

788
01:39:36,699 --> 01:39:40,220
Yeah, it's because they probably all get disconnected.

789
01:39:47,819 --> 01:39:50,399
I need to run.

790
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:52,159
I am running.

791
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:56,539
There ain't nobody here to stop me.

792
01:39:57,340 --> 01:40:02,029
I just get whatever I get from completing this.

793
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:06,319
I think maybe the servers went down to get it.

794
01:40:06,319 --> 01:40:07,760
Now I just get all the spoils.

795
01:40:08,319 --> 01:40:14,399
What's against this camera angle?

796
01:40:14,399 --> 01:40:20,399
Are the servers really that dead?

797
01:40:22,729 --> 01:40:23,449
They shouldn't be.

798
01:40:24,250 --> 01:40:32,109
I'm in an empty server.

799
01:40:32,109 --> 01:40:33,310
Well, I'll go to a new one.

800
01:40:34,670 --> 01:40:36,989
After I get the full reward.

801
01:40:36,989 --> 01:40:41,760
Uh-oh, somebody's coming in.

802
01:40:53,399 --> 01:40:54,920
Wait, am I about to drive right into somebody?

803
01:40:54,920 --> 01:40:55,640
I gotta be ready for this.

804
01:40:56,600 --> 01:41:02,029
Are they going to come straight down the road?

805
01:41:09,819 --> 01:41:10,779
How far away are they?

806
01:41:11,420 --> 01:41:12,909
I got it.

807
01:41:12,909 --> 01:41:13,710
It's right here.

808
01:41:17,119 --> 01:41:19,279
Enemies can't interact with me when I'm in the drop-off area.

809
01:41:19,279 --> 01:41:20,159
All right, we'll get over there.

810
01:41:27,770 --> 01:41:29,529
Red Dead Redemption online.

811
01:41:30,409 --> 01:41:31,529
It's awesome.

812
01:41:32,250 --> 01:41:40,569
It's like a one cent.

813
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:45,560
Wow, that was exhilarating.

814
01:41:46,199 --> 01:41:55,930
Well, here's my experience of the Red Dead 2 online so far.

815
01:41:58,319 --> 01:41:59,199
Hello?

816
01:41:59,199 --> 01:41:59,680
Hello?

817
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:04,300
Anybody here?

818
01:42:04,300 --> 01:42:05,020
Anybody here?

819
01:42:05,020 --> 01:42:05,899
Anybody here?

820
01:42:05,899 --> 01:42:06,859
Anybody here?

821
01:42:06,859 --> 01:42:09,479
What's going on here?

822
01:42:09,479 --> 01:42:09,800
Somebody plug?

823
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:10,359
What's going on here?

824
01:42:10,359 --> 01:42:10,600
Somebody plug?

825
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:11,159
What's going on here?

826
01:42:11,159 --> 01:42:11,479
Somebody plug?

827
01:42:11,479 --> 01:42:12,760
What's going on here?

828
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:29,279
All right, how do I join again?

829
01:42:29,279 --> 01:42:30,720
I want to join like a different game.

830
01:42:31,359 --> 01:42:36,640
All right, join free roam.

831
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:41,439
Be sure you want to join Red Dead online.

832
01:42:41,439 --> 01:42:41,680
Yes.

833
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:44,319
Just get me in a different session.

834
01:42:56,890 --> 01:42:57,930
Hopping dimensions.

835
01:42:58,569 --> 01:43:02,140
I could do the story mission.

836
01:43:02,699 --> 01:43:04,939
At least matchmaking would probably pull people in, right?

837
01:43:05,579 --> 01:43:08,079
Remember when Next was an emote?

838
01:43:08,079 --> 01:43:08,800
Oh yeah, I do.

839
01:43:10,460 --> 01:43:11,500
Boy, that was a mistake.

840
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:25,319
Next.

841
01:43:26,119 --> 01:43:26,520
God.

842
01:43:28,159 --> 01:43:30,399
Immediately after uploading that, I was going...

843
01:43:31,899 --> 01:43:33,899
I don't know if I should actually put this on.

844
01:43:33,899 --> 01:43:35,579
And then I left it there for like a year.

845
01:43:36,220 --> 01:43:43,640
Are we going to get the error code again?

846
01:43:47,899 --> 01:43:48,699
No, we're not.

847
01:43:48,699 --> 01:43:50,699
All right, so here we are.

848
01:44:06,939 --> 01:44:07,899
There we go.

849
01:44:07,899 --> 01:44:08,859
All right, we're good.

850
01:44:08,859 --> 01:44:09,420
We're good.

851
01:44:09,420 --> 01:44:09,979
We're...

852
01:44:09,979 --> 01:44:10,460
They're here.

853
01:44:13,239 --> 01:44:14,039
But where are they?

854
01:44:16,510 --> 01:44:18,430
Okay, a lot of people are...

855
01:44:18,430 --> 01:44:19,710
I'm just in like the shitty place.

856
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:22,600
There we go.

857
01:44:24,270 --> 01:44:25,310
All right, let's just go.

858
01:44:25,310 --> 01:44:26,270
We're going to go on a...

859
01:44:28,239 --> 01:44:29,279
Now I'm excited.

860
01:44:29,279 --> 01:44:30,000
Okay, let's do...

861
01:44:31,439 --> 01:44:38,649
This is like Stranger's Fortnite.

862
01:44:39,289 --> 01:44:43,369
German with a train.

863
01:44:43,369 --> 01:44:44,890
Oh my God, he has headphones on.

864
01:44:44,890 --> 01:44:45,609
He can't hear me.

865
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:49,199
The train.

866
01:44:53,100 --> 01:44:55,260
Oh my God, he has headphones on.

867
01:44:55,260 --> 01:44:56,060
I already did this one.

868
01:44:56,060 --> 01:44:56,939
I don't want to do that one again.

869
01:44:57,819 --> 01:45:04,270
Play horseshoes?

870
01:45:04,989 --> 01:45:06,350
I could play horseshoes, couldn't I?

871
01:45:07,149 --> 01:45:08,510
I want to be clear with other people.

872
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:10,640
Is this another one of those...

873
01:45:11,279 --> 01:45:13,359
And you know somebody stops me missions.

874
01:45:21,229 --> 01:45:22,430
Can you open your house?

875
01:45:22,430 --> 01:45:33,069
All right, well, let's actually then...

876
01:45:33,069 --> 01:45:33,949
Let's go here then.

877
01:45:34,810 --> 01:45:36,569
Where is that yellow marker?

878
01:45:38,489 --> 01:45:38,970
Over here.

879
01:45:39,689 --> 01:45:42,170
Well, I just...

880
01:45:42,170 --> 01:45:43,609
I think I'm going...

881
01:45:43,609 --> 01:45:45,289
Does it tell you if you've been marked?

882
01:45:47,550 --> 01:45:49,710
Another player has marked your direct location.

883
01:45:50,590 --> 01:45:52,460
It might.

884
01:45:52,460 --> 01:45:53,100
It probably does.

885
01:46:05,449 --> 01:46:06,810
NPCs, don't worry about them.

886
01:46:07,289 --> 01:46:07,930
Just leave them be.

887
01:46:08,890 --> 01:46:16,989
Hey, Jeremy.

888
01:46:16,989 --> 01:46:19,310
Your title says you're playing Red Dead 2 online.

889
01:46:19,310 --> 01:46:20,510
Can you update the title?

890
01:46:20,510 --> 01:46:21,949
I don't want people getting confused.

891
01:46:23,470 --> 01:46:29,640
Do I have any items for the horse?

892
01:46:29,640 --> 01:46:30,439
Here, eat an apple.

893
01:46:39,739 --> 01:46:40,539
Mod that guy.

894
01:46:42,239 --> 01:46:43,520
No, nobody's getting modded.

895
01:46:44,399 --> 01:46:50,439
Is this...

896
01:46:50,439 --> 01:46:51,239
Whose place is this?

897
01:46:53,560 --> 01:46:54,359
Is this somebody's camp?

898
01:46:55,880 --> 01:46:57,079
Whose camp is this?

899
01:46:57,079 --> 01:46:57,880
I need to investigate.

900
01:46:57,880 --> 01:46:58,199
Who's here?

901
01:46:58,199 --> 01:46:58,760
Who lives here?

902
01:46:59,399 --> 01:47:07,100
Can I do anything in this person's camp?

903
01:47:10,350 --> 01:47:12,350
Well, the white flag is up, so I can't do anything.

904
01:47:15,210 --> 01:47:15,689
Let's go.

905
01:47:20,729 --> 01:47:22,090
Smash the guy's toilet.

906
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:29,640
Poop in his tent.

907
01:47:30,279 --> 01:47:32,510
No, he has the white flag up.

908
01:47:32,510 --> 01:47:34,750
I can't go to the bathroom on his fucking clothes.

909
01:47:35,550 --> 01:47:38,380
It's far away.

910
01:47:39,579 --> 01:47:43,680
Can I get there by going around the river bank?

911
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:45,600
Or do I have to actually go all the way back up here?

912
01:47:51,930 --> 01:47:53,449
Put ants in his sleeping bag.

913
01:47:53,449 --> 01:47:54,810
You guys are fucking cruel!

914
01:48:04,510 --> 01:48:05,949
Ants in his sleeping bag!

915
01:48:06,670 --> 01:48:14,590
I have to go all the way around.

916
01:48:16,170 --> 01:48:20,430
This horse sucks.

917
01:48:20,989 --> 01:48:22,590
They really want you to pay.

918
01:48:22,590 --> 01:48:25,310
I'm so used to having my $20 horse from the main game.

919
01:48:26,510 --> 01:48:31,739
I can't believe I actually have to go all the way around.

920
01:48:35,449 --> 01:48:36,250
God damn it.

921
01:48:40,649 --> 01:48:40,970
Shit.

922
01:48:41,529 --> 01:48:51,319
I'm not even near his camp anymore.

923
01:48:54,649 --> 01:48:55,449
Take the train.

924
01:48:56,250 --> 01:49:01,949
Join a death match.

925
01:49:01,949 --> 01:49:06,890
Is the train even actually available to take?

926
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:09,319
Oh, it is.

927
01:49:10,649 --> 01:49:11,369
Fast travel.

928
01:49:11,369 --> 01:49:12,170
Holy shit, it is.

929
01:49:12,170 --> 01:49:15,050
All right, so I need to go from here to...

930
01:49:15,050 --> 01:49:16,010
I need to go to Blackwater.

931
01:49:17,529 --> 01:49:17,850
All right.

932
01:49:17,850 --> 01:49:19,130
Well, I didn't even know you could do that.

933
01:49:19,930 --> 01:49:22,970
I don't think that fast travel wouldn't really exist in a game like this,

934
01:49:22,970 --> 01:49:25,529
but I guess you could take the subway in GTA Online, couldn't you?

935
01:49:26,649 --> 01:49:33,399
Any plans of doing online with friends?

936
01:49:33,399 --> 01:49:34,199
Oh, yeah.

937
01:49:34,199 --> 01:49:34,680
Definitely.

938
01:49:36,399 --> 01:49:37,760
Definitely, definitely, definitely.

939
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:39,920
But not everybody can play yet.

940
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:45,760
I did just want to check it out because it's currently only allowed.

941
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:48,409
What is that?

942
01:49:49,050 --> 01:49:50,670
What is this?

943
01:49:52,699 --> 01:49:53,180
Hideout.

944
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:56,319
Hideout?

945
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:58,680
Who's hideout?

946
01:49:59,319 --> 01:49:59,819
What?

947
01:50:04,859 --> 01:50:06,300
Like another player hideout?

948
01:50:06,939 --> 01:50:12,140
Or is this just a random, hey look, a hideout and kill the enemies?

949
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:27,949
There's a lot of people here.

950
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:31,800
Place is on fire.

951
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:35,239
Oh my god, what is that?

952
01:50:35,239 --> 01:50:35,560
What is that?

953
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:35,880
What is this?

954
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:36,520
What is that thing?

955
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:39,159
No, no!

956
01:50:39,159 --> 01:50:39,800
Get away from me!

957
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:42,000
I don't have any gu-

958
01:50:54,010 --> 01:50:54,649
Boss in there?

959
01:50:56,300 --> 01:50:57,260
That's apparently the boss.

960
01:50:58,140 --> 01:51:04,750
Oh, fuck.

961
01:51:04,750 --> 01:51:05,470
Where is he?

962
01:51:05,470 --> 01:51:05,789
Where is he?

963
01:51:05,789 --> 01:51:06,989
Where, where, where, where, where, where, where?

964
01:51:07,949 --> 01:51:16,430
He's over here.

965
01:51:16,430 --> 01:51:26,619
They give you these little fucking BB guns to start the game.

966
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:34,140
I gotta get in there closer.

967
01:51:34,140 --> 01:51:34,859
I gotta move up.

968
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:45,770
I'm gonna go down.

969
01:51:46,810 --> 01:51:52,989
On this rock.

970
01:51:54,989 --> 01:51:56,829
That guy, uh, in the front door.

971
01:52:03,159 --> 01:52:04,279
That guy died somehow.

972
01:52:04,279 --> 01:52:05,560
That guy killed himself somehow.

973
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:13,579
All right, let's get this up.

974
01:52:13,579 --> 01:52:15,500
There's like one guy left up here.

975
01:52:15,500 --> 01:52:17,500
And this is the guy with the big hat on inside.

976
01:52:20,199 --> 01:52:22,600
How are you still alive after I blew up all those tanks?

977
01:52:23,560 --> 01:52:27,819
Nice dodge.

978
01:52:28,220 --> 01:52:29,500
All right, just show your head again, please.

979
01:52:30,460 --> 01:52:39,470
This looks like a pretty good time waster.

980
01:52:42,640 --> 01:52:45,920
I mean, it depends on how-

981
01:52:46,640 --> 01:52:47,680
What the hell?

982
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:50,159
I gotta kill these guys too.

983
01:52:59,039 --> 01:52:59,680
You're still alive.

984
01:53:09,390 --> 01:53:15,640
All right.

985
01:53:16,439 --> 01:53:18,939
Um, hideout clear.

986
01:53:20,220 --> 01:53:21,899
Now I have to pick up everybody's body.

987
01:53:25,449 --> 01:53:27,050
Red Dead Redemption 76.

988
01:53:27,609 --> 01:53:29,869
Okay, I got rank five.

989
01:53:30,510 --> 01:53:34,000
I unlocked, uh, I unlocked like a-

990
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:35,680
The spleen or a kidney or something.

991
01:53:36,239 --> 01:53:37,439
Pump action shotgun.

992
01:53:38,399 --> 01:53:39,439
And a military jacket.

993
01:53:43,289 --> 01:53:44,649
Zero percent on story missions.

994
01:53:45,210 --> 01:53:46,489
Leave the bodies as a warning.

995
01:53:46,489 --> 01:53:48,010
I gotta loot at least some of these.

996
01:53:49,050 --> 01:53:49,850
Speaking of loot.

997
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,680
I mean, there has to be something in here, right?

998
01:53:54,460 --> 01:53:57,260
Why have a giant hideout boat if you're not gonna have anything there?

999
01:53:57,979 --> 01:54:06,270
Now I'm looking for a ladder.

1000
01:54:06,270 --> 01:54:07,479
Can I climb this?

1001
01:54:16,890 --> 01:54:17,609
Loot the dog.

1002
01:54:19,770 --> 01:54:21,210
What do you think the dog has on him?

1003
01:54:24,510 --> 01:54:25,550
Nothing up here at all.

1004
01:54:26,270 --> 01:54:33,680
It's to lure in the ADHD streamers.

1005
01:54:34,399 --> 01:54:43,479
That's a nice hat.

1006
01:54:43,479 --> 01:54:45,880
Oh, there's a catapult.

1007
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:48,920
If I pull that thing, it'll shoot a rock directly into that pole,

1008
01:54:48,920 --> 01:54:51,560
destroying the boat and killing me and anyone else that's on board.

1009
01:54:52,439 --> 01:54:53,020
It's okay.

1010
01:54:53,020 --> 01:54:54,859
Like a hundred more years, uh, they'll figure it out.

1011
01:54:55,579 --> 01:54:57,579
Well, a hundred years in the past, they figured it out.

1012
01:54:57,579 --> 01:54:59,180
I don't know why we'd screw it up like this.

1013
01:55:00,220 --> 01:55:01,470
Nothing here.

1014
01:55:13,390 --> 01:55:17,069
I'm gonna be honest, uh, what the hell was that all about?

1015
01:55:17,789 --> 01:55:19,310
Can you give me a cool boat to explore?

1016
01:55:19,310 --> 01:55:22,270
And it's just the shitty catapult that doesn't work.

1017
01:55:22,909 --> 01:55:24,560
We spoke so soon.

1018
01:55:25,119 --> 01:55:25,600
Here it is.

1019
01:55:29,079 --> 01:55:30,039
No, never mind.

1020
01:55:30,039 --> 01:55:31,159
This is just explosives.

1021
01:55:31,880 --> 01:55:36,239
Come on, there's nothing in the red Acme chest.

1022
01:55:37,039 --> 01:55:38,159
Like the Road Runner chest.

1023
01:55:38,159 --> 01:55:39,039
There's nothing over here.

1024
01:55:39,680 --> 01:55:48,170
There's not a backpack that has a propeller on it that I can use.

1025
01:55:48,970 --> 01:55:53,579
Fuck it.

1026
01:55:53,579 --> 01:55:54,779
Let's just keep going.

1027
01:55:54,779 --> 01:56:00,760
I mean, that was kind of cool.

1028
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,880
All right, back to the mission we were doing.

1029
01:56:06,680 --> 01:56:09,260
I don't know what my horse is.

1030
01:56:09,819 --> 01:56:15,100
I think I'm being followed.

1031
01:56:15,100 --> 01:56:31,420
I'm being followed.

1032
01:56:31,979 --> 01:56:36,779
There they are.

1033
01:56:36,779 --> 01:56:37,100
They're there.

1034
01:56:37,100 --> 01:56:37,579
They're on the horse.

1035
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:47,720
Are you following me?

1036
01:56:47,720 --> 01:56:48,199
What are you doing?

1037
01:56:48,840 --> 01:56:52,760
They're riding around in circles over there.

1038
01:57:05,359 --> 01:57:06,079
I'm ready.

1039
01:57:06,079 --> 01:57:07,039
I'm prepared.

1040
01:57:07,039 --> 01:57:11,899
Hey, how about, hey, I don't know if you can hear me.

1041
01:57:11,899 --> 01:57:43,289
How about, uh, server's just high noon to me.

1042
01:57:48,859 --> 01:57:49,899
Oh, he heard me.

1043
01:57:49,899 --> 01:57:50,300
All right.

1044
01:57:50,300 --> 01:57:56,859
Yeah, you were saying.

1045
01:57:57,420 --> 01:58:01,500
See, stop killing each other.

1046
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:02,539
Don't you understand?

1047
01:58:02,539 --> 01:58:04,479
The guy at Rockstar that's ripping it out.

1048
01:58:04,479 --> 01:58:06,399
The like Thanos Rockstar guy.

1049
01:58:08,109 --> 01:58:09,229
No, somebody in town.

1050
01:58:12,220 --> 01:58:13,420
Screamed a bunch of swears

1051
01:58:13,420 --> 01:58:15,260
and then threw a grenade into the barbershop.

1052
01:58:15,260 --> 01:58:16,569
Rip it out.

1053
01:58:16,569 --> 01:58:17,529
Start over.

1054
01:58:17,529 --> 01:58:35,869
Okay, I'm back.

1055
01:58:35,869 --> 01:58:42,319
And, well, you gave up.

1056
01:58:42,319 --> 01:58:43,680
All right, so let, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1057
01:58:43,680 --> 01:58:45,359
Well, we're going here.

1058
01:58:45,359 --> 01:58:54,170
I mean, let's give Rockstar a little bit of slack.

1059
01:58:54,170 --> 01:58:56,729
There are probably two to three hundred million people

1060
01:58:58,359 --> 01:59:01,390
all trying to connect at the same time.

1061
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:14,439
Two to three hundred, you mean.

1062
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:16,880
Did I say million?

1063
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:17,920
Did I add the million?

1064
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:19,359
I think I added the million.

1065
01:59:19,359 --> 01:59:23,609
I meant, I meant, I meant that in yen.

1066
01:59:24,090 --> 01:59:26,489
Two to three hundred million yen people.

1067
01:59:26,489 --> 01:59:28,569
Which is like, what, two thousand?

1068
01:59:29,210 --> 01:59:59,319
All right, let's fast travel over there.

1069
01:59:59,319 --> 02:00:01,479
And are we actually in a game with people?

1070
02:00:01,479 --> 02:00:03,079
Let me make sure.

1071
02:00:04,460 --> 02:00:05,020
Yes, we are.

1072
02:00:05,659 --> 02:00:12,359
Two hundred million yen is 1.7 million.

1073
02:00:12,359 --> 02:00:14,119
Yeah, so that's 1.7 million people

1074
02:00:14,119 --> 02:00:15,399
probably trying to play at the same time.

1075
02:00:18,720 --> 02:00:19,279
Fast travel.

1076
02:00:23,739 --> 02:00:24,140
Let's see.

1077
02:00:24,140 --> 02:00:24,939
How much does it cost?

1078
02:00:26,489 --> 02:00:31,739
Oh, man, that's, that's, that's like 30 percent,

1079
02:00:31,739 --> 02:00:34,060
33 percent of my entire savings.

1080
02:00:34,779 --> 02:00:43,899
I just dumped my 401k out

1081
02:00:44,460 --> 02:00:46,909
to be able to take a taxi.

1082
02:00:58,090 --> 02:00:58,970
Start riding.

1083
02:01:04,119 --> 02:01:21,340
Let's try these for now.

1084
02:01:24,189 --> 02:01:26,270
Beat against up to 32 players

1085
02:01:26,270 --> 02:01:28,829
across large maps in a series of thrilling game types.

1086
02:01:29,630 --> 02:01:37,020
Walk straight into a race and kick up some dust on horseback.

1087
02:01:37,819 --> 02:01:39,840
Yeah, I want to try a race.

1088
02:01:46,750 --> 02:01:47,869
And then we'll go, we'll try.

1089
02:01:47,869 --> 02:01:52,119
Maybe they're just doing Thanos maintenance to it.

1090
02:01:52,680 --> 02:02:02,670
It's not a 2018 multiplayer game without Battle Royale.

1091
02:02:03,390 --> 02:02:10,189
Why don't I ever juggle on stream anymore?

1092
02:02:12,649 --> 02:02:13,770
I don't know how to juggle.

1093
02:02:24,729 --> 02:02:25,289
Same.

1094
02:02:25,289 --> 02:02:27,050
Yeah, I don't know how to show.

1095
02:02:27,050 --> 02:02:27,930
I don't know how to juggle.

1096
02:02:28,810 --> 02:02:33,630
But why don't I do it anymore?

1097
02:02:34,270 --> 02:02:35,149
Because I don't know how.

1098
02:02:35,869 --> 02:02:43,659
What am I looking at here?

1099
02:02:43,659 --> 02:02:47,239
Do you wish to spectate this session?

1100
02:02:48,399 --> 02:02:50,220
Um, okay.

1101
02:02:51,100 --> 02:02:55,260
Oh, this is a really bad race we're watching.

1102
02:02:57,210 --> 02:02:58,569
Oh, they crashed.

1103
02:02:58,649 --> 02:02:59,850
A wagon just crashed.

1104
02:03:00,810 --> 02:03:06,760
What's the next one?

1105
02:03:21,689 --> 02:03:22,010
Okay.

1106
02:03:24,319 --> 02:03:25,920
Oh, there's the other two people.

1107
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:29,319
You have to pick up Donkey Kong barrels.

1108
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:33,369
This guy's shooting.

1109
02:03:33,369 --> 02:03:34,090
Isn't that illegal?

1110
02:03:38,329 --> 02:03:39,689
I thought, I thought that was illegal.

1111
02:03:39,689 --> 02:03:40,890
I thought you couldn't use weapons.

1112
02:03:41,609 --> 02:03:48,760
Who's on the other list?

1113
02:03:50,239 --> 02:03:51,359
Somebody in the train?

1114
02:03:56,300 --> 02:04:00,539
That's a quick way to win a race is to drive the train there.

1115
02:04:06,250 --> 02:04:07,770
38 people to start this.

1116
02:04:08,489 --> 02:04:15,800
Well, this guy is, I want the person in like, first place.

1117
02:04:16,680 --> 02:04:25,739
Oh god, he's got headphones on.

1118
02:04:26,380 --> 02:04:28,159
So this is the person in second place.

1119
02:04:28,159 --> 02:04:29,359
Here's the guy in first place.

1120
02:04:30,079 --> 02:04:31,149
Okay.

1121
02:04:31,789 --> 02:04:33,470
Let's see how he does.

1122
02:04:34,699 --> 02:04:35,180
Good luck.

1123
02:04:35,180 --> 02:04:36,939
I hope you, no, you're in sixth.

1124
02:04:37,659 --> 02:04:42,779
Why can I, wait, this guy's not in first place.

1125
02:04:42,779 --> 02:04:43,739
I just went backwards.

1126
02:04:55,550 --> 02:04:56,430
Did you just win?

1127
02:04:56,989 --> 02:04:57,869
That person just won.

1128
02:04:58,670 --> 02:05:01,869
They were so hell bent on shooting the other person that they lost.

1129
02:05:02,670 --> 02:05:04,920
Yeah, here comes Sam.

1130
02:05:04,920 --> 02:05:05,560
All right, let's go.

1131
02:05:07,439 --> 02:05:07,920
My turn.

1132
02:05:08,479 --> 02:05:20,619
So is this just like in GTA online where

1133
02:05:21,500 --> 02:05:24,220
in the first one second of it going three, two, one,

1134
02:05:25,020 --> 02:05:27,340
14 people crash into each other and fall off the horses

1135
02:05:27,340 --> 02:05:29,100
and then somebody accidentally gets in first place

1136
02:05:29,100 --> 02:05:30,779
and they stay in first place the rest of the time.

1137
02:05:33,479 --> 02:05:37,500
This guy's not even doing the race anymore.

1138
02:05:45,180 --> 02:05:45,899
First place.

1139
02:05:50,399 --> 02:05:51,680
I'll take my reward, please.

1140
02:05:52,239 --> 02:05:52,720
Thank you.

1141
02:06:05,710 --> 02:06:09,479
What?

1142
02:06:09,479 --> 02:06:11,159
Okay, uh, proceed.

1143
02:06:14,539 --> 02:06:15,020
Stable.

1144
02:06:15,659 --> 02:06:18,300
I'll be riding with Sean who sucks.

1145
02:06:19,020 --> 02:06:20,060
Game details.

1146
02:06:20,060 --> 02:06:22,539
Yep, I'm, I'm ready.

1147
02:06:22,539 --> 02:06:23,020
Ready up.

1148
02:06:31,609 --> 02:06:32,329
Change outfit.

1149
02:06:32,329 --> 02:06:33,289
I don't have any outfits.

1150
02:06:34,090 --> 02:06:39,529
What a wind down different if I didn't get-

1151
02:06:39,529 --> 02:06:40,649
Hey, oh, I turned off.

1152
02:06:40,649 --> 02:06:41,449
I turned this off.

1153
02:06:47,239 --> 02:06:48,119
Didn't I do that?

1154
02:06:48,119 --> 02:06:49,079
Did I turn that off?

1155
02:06:50,170 --> 02:06:52,170
All right, we just gotta just pretend we're not here.

1156
02:07:08,460 --> 02:07:09,180
All right, let's do it.

1157
02:07:09,739 --> 02:07:11,899
Bards crossing, point to point, race across, bards crossing.

1158
02:07:12,699 --> 02:07:13,520
I'm ready.

1159
02:07:13,520 --> 02:07:18,699
Now, heated gaming moment inbound.

1160
02:07:20,890 --> 02:07:21,210
Yep.

1161
02:07:25,869 --> 02:07:28,989
Three, two, one, go.

1162
02:07:29,710 --> 02:07:37,210
That's me.

1163
02:07:44,189 --> 02:07:46,189
Three, two, one.

1164
02:07:46,189 --> 02:07:47,069
Why am I all the way in the back?

1165
02:07:47,069 --> 02:07:47,630
That's not fair.

1166
02:07:48,430 --> 02:07:55,359
I'm gonna get in that first place position.

1167
02:07:56,479 --> 02:07:58,939
I'm at least gonna start in like the top.

1168
02:07:58,939 --> 02:08:00,220
I gotta finish in the-

1169
02:08:01,260 --> 02:08:02,300
It really is Mario Kart.

1170
02:08:03,020 --> 02:08:04,279
I just got a gun.

1171
02:08:04,920 --> 02:08:07,390
In the first place.

1172
02:08:07,390 --> 02:08:19,340
How do I punch?

1173
02:08:21,850 --> 02:08:22,170
What?

1174
02:08:22,890 --> 02:08:24,729
Oh my god, you have so much health.

1175
02:08:25,529 --> 02:08:30,920
That's not what I thought it was gonna be.

1176
02:08:31,640 --> 02:08:35,880
My horse, I gotta be careful.

1177
02:08:36,279 --> 02:08:36,760
Slow down.

1178
02:08:37,479 --> 02:08:38,279
Let the horse breathe.

1179
02:08:51,770 --> 02:08:52,649
Why did I die?

1180
02:08:53,689 --> 02:09:04,720
Whose horse is that?

1181
02:09:04,720 --> 02:09:05,920
Why is it in the way?

1182
02:09:05,920 --> 02:09:06,159
What?

1183
02:09:13,840 --> 02:09:15,359
What's the fucking spawning horse?

1184
02:09:16,159 --> 02:09:17,789
Was that my horse?

1185
02:09:24,600 --> 02:09:26,279
This is wild horses running around.

1186
02:09:26,840 --> 02:09:29,420
Okay, I need something.

1187
02:09:29,420 --> 02:09:32,399
I don't know what it is.

1188
02:09:32,399 --> 02:09:34,810
God, nothing.

1189
02:09:34,810 --> 02:09:38,479
I'm in the last place right now.

1190
02:09:38,479 --> 02:09:39,279
But that wasn't my fault.

1191
02:09:39,279 --> 02:09:40,399
I got a horse spawn.

1192
02:09:40,960 --> 02:09:42,720
Somebody dropped a horse banana peel on me.

1193
02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:44,319
That wasn't fair.

1194
02:09:45,199 --> 02:09:53,159
Oh, you gotta collect a barrel to replenish the stamina.

1195
02:09:58,109 --> 02:09:58,350
What?

1196
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:13,840
Does he like tap my foot and I died?

1197
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:22,189
Three green shells.

1198
02:10:22,189 --> 02:10:23,789
All right, this is where I'm gonna get the lightning bolt.

1199
02:10:24,590 --> 02:10:26,029
See, it really is the lightning bolt.

1200
02:10:27,819 --> 02:10:29,659
I actually just picked up a lightning bolt.

1201
02:10:29,659 --> 02:10:33,000
All right, now I got a shotgun.

1202
02:10:33,720 --> 02:10:38,060
I just shrunk everybody by like 60%.

1203
02:10:38,060 --> 02:10:38,460
I'm good.

1204
02:10:41,289 --> 02:10:42,329
Not in the last place anymore.

1205
02:10:42,890 --> 02:10:56,010
That person's gone.

1206
02:10:56,010 --> 02:10:57,289
That person's off the track completely.

1207
02:10:57,289 --> 02:10:58,409
I gotta get in eighth place here.

1208
02:11:01,579 --> 02:11:01,979
What?

1209
02:11:01,979 --> 02:11:06,890
Is he phased in?

1210
02:11:06,890 --> 02:11:08,380
I don't understand.

1211
02:11:08,380 --> 02:11:09,180
He just phased in.

1212
02:11:18,680 --> 02:11:20,279
How come he doesn't go off?

1213
02:11:20,279 --> 02:11:21,479
Why does he not go off?

1214
02:11:22,199 --> 02:11:23,239
Why does he?

1215
02:11:23,239 --> 02:11:25,239
Why does he not get affected by that?

1216
02:11:25,800 --> 02:11:26,920
That was ridiculous.

1217
02:11:33,659 --> 02:11:38,060
I get fucking tapped on the toe and I flip off and die.

1218
02:11:39,420 --> 02:11:42,060
My horse spins around in a circle a hundred miles per hour.

1219
02:11:42,060 --> 02:11:49,340
And what the fuck is happening?

1220
02:11:49,899 --> 02:11:53,500
Hey, I didn't come in last.

1221
02:11:54,220 --> 02:11:59,020
You can just finish line.

1222
02:12:11,819 --> 02:12:13,260
I can't come in last place.

1223
02:12:14,140 --> 02:12:14,920
It's all right.

1224
02:12:14,920 --> 02:12:17,079
The guy that isn't last place right now gave up.

1225
02:12:26,939 --> 02:12:27,739
What was that?

1226
02:12:28,460 --> 02:12:32,590
That was absolute dog shit.

1227
02:12:33,229 --> 02:12:37,319
The NF is worse than last place.

1228
02:12:37,319 --> 02:12:37,800
No, it's not.

1229
02:12:37,800 --> 02:12:39,000
That means that I still tried.

1230
02:12:39,720 --> 02:12:49,529
That guy killed me so I couldn't finish.

1231
02:12:49,529 --> 02:12:50,250
What a dick.

1232
02:12:50,250 --> 02:12:53,689
Yeah, that's also the guy that ran through

1233
02:12:53,689 --> 02:12:55,850
mud, concrete, and like four explosions.

1234
02:12:56,489 --> 02:12:58,010
And he was completely fine.

1235
02:12:58,409 --> 02:12:58,970
Scratch on him.

1236
02:13:09,130 --> 02:13:09,689
Purchases.

1237
02:13:10,329 --> 02:13:10,970
All ammo.

1238
02:13:12,840 --> 02:13:13,399
Arrows.

1239
02:13:15,079 --> 02:13:16,279
I don't want this.

1240
02:13:16,279 --> 02:13:20,279
We've got 14 people.

1241
02:13:20,279 --> 02:13:21,560
Let's try this again.

1242
02:13:21,560 --> 02:13:22,840
I have to try this again.

1243
02:13:22,840 --> 02:13:23,239
I have to.

1244
02:13:30,279 --> 02:13:30,920
What the hell?

1245
02:13:33,260 --> 02:13:34,460
Mario Kart guns.

1246
02:13:35,180 --> 02:13:44,510
How do you turn off GTA mode?

1247
02:13:44,510 --> 02:13:45,310
I'm not sure you can.

1248
02:13:48,640 --> 02:13:50,800
You're just going to get angry like a hitman.

1249
02:13:50,800 --> 02:13:51,520
No, no.

1250
02:13:52,239 --> 02:13:57,289
Is there actually a battle royale mode in the game?

1251
02:13:57,289 --> 02:13:58,090
We'll do it after this.

1252
02:14:04,680 --> 02:14:05,319
Yes, there is.

1253
02:14:05,319 --> 02:14:05,560
Okay.

1254
02:14:07,369 --> 02:14:09,930
One dollar horse versus a thousand dollar horse.

1255
02:14:09,930 --> 02:14:10,489
That's okay.

1256
02:14:16,829 --> 02:14:20,510
Ride through all the signal fires around Valentine in any order.

1257
02:14:21,310 --> 02:14:22,890
So that's odd.

1258
02:14:24,600 --> 02:14:26,039
You have to just touch every single one.

1259
02:14:26,600 --> 02:14:30,029
Am I enjoying it so far?

1260
02:14:31,720 --> 02:14:32,520
It's fun.

1261
02:14:32,520 --> 02:14:34,439
I can't really give you a true assessment of it though

1262
02:14:34,439 --> 02:14:36,760
because I feel like I have to try to do everything.

1263
02:14:38,079 --> 02:14:41,760
It still has the same annoying flaws from GTA Online

1264
02:14:41,760 --> 02:14:43,279
that have somehow poured it over here.

1265
02:14:44,239 --> 02:14:46,720
Huge loading screens between every single thing you do.

1266
02:14:47,680 --> 02:14:51,789
But besides that.

1267
02:14:52,989 --> 02:14:53,229
All right.

1268
02:14:53,229 --> 02:14:53,710
Here we go.

1269
02:14:57,720 --> 02:14:58,920
Melee combat is disabled.

1270
02:14:59,560 --> 02:15:01,840
So you can go in any order.

1271
02:15:02,640 --> 02:15:05,479
Why am I instantly losing?

1272
02:15:07,880 --> 02:15:09,960
Is my character suck?

1273
02:15:10,600 --> 02:15:16,060
I think my character just sucks.

1274
02:15:22,829 --> 02:15:24,109
What did I do that was so wrong there?

1275
02:15:24,109 --> 02:15:24,909
I like touched him.

1276
02:15:31,369 --> 02:15:32,250
Is it my horse?

1277
02:15:32,970 --> 02:15:40,510
He's too top heavy.

1278
02:15:41,310 --> 02:15:53,609
He's just killing me.

1279
02:15:55,449 --> 02:15:57,210
I have weights on my character.

1280
02:15:59,550 --> 02:16:00,989
I have extra pounds on.

1281
02:16:01,630 --> 02:16:02,350
It's not fair.

1282
02:16:17,130 --> 02:16:19,050
Why does it happen to me but not him?

1283
02:16:19,050 --> 02:16:20,409
Why does it happen to me but not him?

1284
02:16:20,409 --> 02:16:21,130
I'm gonna freak out.

1285
02:16:24,909 --> 02:16:26,029
Why does it happen to me?

1286
02:16:26,670 --> 02:16:27,710
Why does it only happen to me?

1287
02:16:28,590 --> 02:16:29,710
It's not, that's not fair.

1288
02:16:31,550 --> 02:16:32,030
Why?

1289
02:16:44,079 --> 02:16:44,879
I'm gonna calm down.

1290
02:16:45,520 --> 02:16:46,399
I have to calm down.

1291
02:16:47,040 --> 02:16:51,760
You have more momentum?

1292
02:16:51,760 --> 02:16:52,159
What?

1293
02:16:52,159 --> 02:16:54,799
You can't just drive into somebody and not get hurt.

1294
02:17:01,760 --> 02:17:03,040
I can't fucking believe it.

1295
02:17:03,680 --> 02:17:05,280
That is absolute bullshit.

1296
02:17:06,079 --> 02:17:07,280
I wonder if he's gonna touch me

1297
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:09,360
and I'm going to springboard off of the horse.

1298
02:17:13,719 --> 02:17:14,840
Everybody's Donkey Kong

1299
02:17:14,840 --> 02:17:17,239
and I get to be fucking Toad or Koopa Troopa.

1300
02:17:18,200 --> 02:17:22,010
If that were me, I would have exploded.

1301
02:17:22,010 --> 02:17:23,049
I would have spun a hundred times.

1302
02:17:31,040 --> 02:17:32,239
I'm an NPC.

1303
02:17:32,239 --> 02:17:33,280
I've come to terms with it.

1304
02:17:34,079 --> 02:17:37,200
Everybody's playing the fun game

1305
02:17:37,200 --> 02:17:38,959
and I get to be the guy that's here.

1306
02:17:38,959 --> 02:17:40,639
The AI bot that just falls down.

1307
02:17:42,909 --> 02:17:53,450
Didn't fall off that time.

1308
02:17:54,170 --> 02:18:03,850
I only got three more.

1309
02:18:03,850 --> 02:18:05,290
Everyone's not paying attention though

1310
02:18:05,290 --> 02:18:07,450
so I might have a chance to at least score some points.

1311
02:18:08,489 --> 02:18:11,229
I'm gonna, I'm not gonna finish.

1312
02:18:11,229 --> 02:18:11,709
I'm not gonna finish.

1313
02:18:12,590 --> 02:18:19,129
The reason why I'm not finishing is because I,

1314
02:18:20,090 --> 02:18:22,969
I keep getting fucking destroyed on the horse.

1315
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:29,200
People will run full blast into me

1316
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:32,479
and just drive right through me like, like a ghost.

1317
02:18:47,879 --> 02:18:50,360
Their horses are better in heavier weight classes.

1318
02:18:52,569 --> 02:18:55,209
I really look like such a fucking imbecile.

1319
02:18:55,930 --> 02:18:58,200
I'm just such easy prey.

1320
02:18:59,979 --> 02:19:03,020
I'm, I'm the fucking kid that got this for Christmas.

1321
02:19:06,399 --> 02:19:07,680
All right, I'm, I'm out of here.

1322
02:19:08,479 --> 02:19:15,870
I'm out of here, but I can't quit.

1323
02:19:17,950 --> 02:19:19,069
Yes, I'm sure I want to exit.

1324
02:19:28,399 --> 02:19:30,000
You're a Christmas noob.

1325
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,959
Guy comes in, not even leveling up his horse.

1326
02:19:32,959 --> 02:19:34,079
No armor and no nothing.

1327
02:19:35,959 --> 02:19:37,159
It just gets bullied.

1328
02:19:37,879 --> 02:19:39,760
All right, what were the other things?

1329
02:19:39,760 --> 02:19:42,170
What's the Battle Royale mode?

1330
02:19:47,959 --> 02:19:49,079
Is it Showdown series?

1331
02:19:49,319 --> 02:19:51,840
Which one is it?

1332
02:19:51,840 --> 02:19:55,389
Victory Royale.

1333
02:19:55,389 --> 02:20:10,350
That's so stupid.

1334
02:20:11,069 --> 02:20:15,520
He's doing Battle Royale with the P-shooters.

1335
02:20:15,520 --> 02:20:16,719
I just want to try.

1336
02:20:17,440 --> 02:20:25,079
Red Dead Mario Kart, Red Dead Fortnite.

1337
02:20:25,799 --> 02:20:34,889
Just abuse the auto aim.

1338
02:20:35,610 --> 02:20:40,299
I don't, auto aim is not really that apparent

1339
02:20:40,299 --> 02:20:41,739
in online to other players.

1340
02:20:42,700 --> 02:20:45,930
32 player Battle Royale.

1341
02:20:46,569 --> 02:20:49,950
Yeah, I'm gonna get, I'm gonna get a steak dinner,

1342
02:20:49,950 --> 02:20:50,750
whatever they call it.

1343
02:20:51,389 --> 02:20:52,829
I'm gonna get the fried chicken.

1344
02:20:52,829 --> 02:20:54,190
I'm gonna get the fried chicken.

1345
02:21:09,610 --> 02:21:10,569
All right, let's go.

1346
02:21:10,569 --> 02:21:11,290
What's the mode?

1347
02:21:13,790 --> 02:21:14,430
What's the briefing?

1348
02:21:14,430 --> 02:21:14,750
Let's see.

1349
02:21:19,159 --> 02:21:20,040
Name your weapon.

1350
02:21:23,760 --> 02:21:25,280
Brief roll where the trickier weapons

1351
02:21:25,280 --> 02:21:26,559
earn more points per kill.

1352
02:21:28,680 --> 02:21:30,200
What?

1353
02:21:30,200 --> 02:21:32,040
Tomahawks will kill players in a single hit.

1354
02:21:33,639 --> 02:21:37,069
Okay, kill every, dispatch opponents.

1355
02:21:37,709 --> 02:21:40,030
Are they on the minimap or is it just random people?

1356
02:21:42,860 --> 02:21:48,959
I hear noises.

1357
02:21:48,959 --> 02:22:00,319
There we go.

1358
02:22:00,319 --> 02:22:08,719
He doesn't know I'm behind him.

1359
02:22:21,680 --> 02:22:42,200
All right, whoa, whoa, guy up there.

1360
02:22:42,200 --> 02:22:43,079
Anybody Tomahawks?

1361
02:22:43,799 --> 02:22:56,920
There he is, somebody up on the rock.

1362
02:22:59,389 --> 02:23:00,590
Oh, there's an item up here.

1363
02:23:00,590 --> 02:23:01,389
There's a weapon up here.

1364
02:23:01,389 --> 02:23:02,510
This is probably gonna be, yep.

1365
02:23:03,709 --> 02:23:19,950
Give me that item.

1366
02:23:19,950 --> 02:23:21,549
Where's the, where's the, where's the sniper rifle?

1367
02:23:28,350 --> 02:23:31,120
Put it on, put it on.

1368
02:23:31,120 --> 02:23:35,639
Oh, you know how fast I can tap circle, buddy?

1369
02:23:42,860 --> 02:23:46,959
Oh, how do I use it?

1370
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:50,280
R1, oh, I'm just a target up here.

1371
02:24:02,680 --> 02:24:14,920
Oh, Tomahawk, battery's low.

1372
02:24:14,920 --> 02:24:15,399
It's all right.

1373
02:24:16,120 --> 02:24:30,190
Don't you dare, don't you dare.

1374
02:24:31,229 --> 02:24:35,879
Oh, come on.

1375
02:24:35,879 --> 02:24:37,879
Oh, that's actually pissing me off.

1376
02:24:37,879 --> 02:24:39,559
That actually pisses me off.

1377
02:24:39,559 --> 02:24:40,520
I was doing really well.

1378
02:24:42,379 --> 02:24:43,340
Oh, come on.

1379
02:24:43,979 --> 02:24:50,969
I was doing, I was, I was had to a bit

1380
02:24:50,969 --> 02:24:52,250
in either first or second place.

1381
02:24:59,000 --> 02:24:59,719
Come on.

1382
02:24:59,719 --> 02:25:07,950
That was fun.

1383
02:25:07,950 --> 02:25:19,479
I was so proud of you.

1384
02:25:20,040 --> 02:25:21,239
Disconnected, charged a bit.

1385
02:25:21,239 --> 02:25:21,719
What are you talking about?

1386
02:25:21,719 --> 02:25:22,360
I just plugged it in.

1387
02:25:23,399 --> 02:25:24,969
That's not plugged in?

1388
02:25:25,770 --> 02:25:32,989
How am I not connected?

1389
02:25:38,909 --> 02:25:40,040
What are you talking about?

1390
02:25:41,639 --> 02:25:42,840
Why does this not understand

1391
02:25:42,840 --> 02:25:44,280
that my controller's plugged in?

1392
02:25:49,559 --> 02:25:49,879
Okay.

1393
02:25:54,559 --> 02:25:56,360
Am I connected?

1394
02:25:57,420 --> 02:25:57,979
All right, I am.

1395
02:25:57,979 --> 02:25:58,780
There we go.

1396
02:25:58,780 --> 02:26:03,790
I have to charge my charger.

1397
02:26:07,450 --> 02:26:09,129
I don't think I've been able to stay connected

1398
02:26:09,770 --> 02:26:14,110
for more than, what, 30 minutes?

1399
02:26:14,750 --> 02:26:25,309
Sometimes less.

1400
02:26:25,870 --> 02:26:28,840
Well, the people that are asking how the game is

1401
02:26:28,840 --> 02:26:30,280
and if it's any fun in multiplayer.

1402
02:26:31,079 --> 02:26:34,110
It, I mean, it seems like it is.

1403
02:26:34,110 --> 02:26:35,950
I sure would love to play it uninterrupted

1404
02:26:35,950 --> 02:26:36,989
for more than 30 minutes.

1405
02:26:38,110 --> 02:26:39,549
Kill all the players to rise up the leaderboard.

1406
02:26:39,549 --> 02:26:41,229
The higher you get, the more points you're worth.

1407
02:26:42,030 --> 02:26:42,510
That's cool.

1408
02:26:43,389 --> 02:26:49,360
Did I just join in a random game here?

1409
02:26:51,920 --> 02:26:52,639
Chest down there.

1410
02:26:54,120 --> 02:26:56,760
Why is this not just, what is this, a nuke?

1411
02:27:08,329 --> 02:27:12,219
I think I did it.

1412
02:27:12,219 --> 02:27:14,620
I think I got, I shot him in the head like five times.

1413
02:27:22,649 --> 02:27:23,850
That's probably so scary.

1414
02:27:33,440 --> 02:27:34,799
PS4 aim.

1415
02:27:35,600 --> 02:27:38,159
Well, I mean, it's, I wish this was on PC.

1416
02:27:38,159 --> 02:27:41,440
Fistful of Rags is one of my favorite shooters,

1417
02:27:41,440 --> 02:27:41,840
like ever.

1418
02:27:44,559 --> 02:27:46,639
And having this on PC and actually control it

1419
02:27:46,639 --> 02:27:48,639
with a mouse and keyboard at like 60 FPS,

1420
02:27:48,639 --> 02:27:49,920
I would, I would play this every day.

1421
02:27:51,579 --> 02:27:53,500
Yeah, um, okay, sweet.

1422
02:27:54,540 --> 02:27:56,040
Is that guy talking to me?

1423
02:28:03,389 --> 02:28:05,469
It's like, I feel like you guys in chat

1424
02:28:05,469 --> 02:28:06,270
have said that before.

1425
02:28:06,270 --> 02:28:08,190
Like, okay, yeah, whatever you say, dude.

1426
02:28:08,190 --> 02:28:14,059
I can't turn this off either.

1427
02:28:14,700 --> 02:28:15,100
Can I?

1428
02:28:20,239 --> 02:28:21,280
I can't turn it up.

1429
02:28:21,280 --> 02:28:24,120
It's only on every, why?

1430
02:28:24,120 --> 02:28:25,079
Rockstar, why?

1431
02:28:28,010 --> 02:28:29,049
Of all the things.

1432
02:28:29,610 --> 02:28:38,879
So hold on, I can actually use it in multiplayer?

1433
02:28:38,879 --> 02:28:39,600
That seems so odd.

1434
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,809
Oh, you can't be doing this.

1435
02:28:52,809 --> 02:28:53,930
Can turn it off.

1436
02:28:53,930 --> 02:28:54,430
Okay.

1437
02:29:04,430 --> 02:29:05,149
Interesting.

1438
02:29:05,149 --> 02:29:05,709
Sorry, brother.

1439
02:29:05,709 --> 02:29:06,750
How'd you do you like that?

1440
02:29:11,610 --> 02:29:13,790
How do I turn it off?

1441
02:29:14,430 --> 02:29:22,170
I'm getting nasty.

1442
02:29:22,170 --> 02:29:24,889
Open voice chat is seriously just like,

1443
02:29:24,889 --> 02:29:27,209
it's such a distracting, annoying thing

1444
02:29:27,209 --> 02:29:28,090
in every video game.

1445
02:29:34,040 --> 02:29:39,129
It's like, welcome to the wild west.

1446
02:29:39,930 --> 02:29:43,610
You play as Arthur Morgan and his band of misfits.

1447
02:29:44,649 --> 02:29:45,370
What time is it?

1448
02:29:46,250 --> 02:29:46,809
Where are we?

1449
02:29:48,909 --> 02:29:49,549
Shut up, mom.

1450
02:29:59,440 --> 02:30:00,000
I think I lost.

1451
02:30:00,719 --> 02:30:02,889
It's going to explode.

1452
02:30:09,760 --> 02:30:10,879
Don't be rude to mom.

1453
02:30:15,870 --> 02:30:17,069
I died five times.

1454
02:30:20,860 --> 02:30:21,500
What?

1455
02:30:21,500 --> 02:30:43,629
All right, let's go.

1456
02:30:49,930 --> 02:30:50,729
MVP.

1457
02:30:53,770 --> 02:31:04,829
You're a band of outlaws,

1458
02:31:04,829 --> 02:31:07,870
fighting over a treasure chest on the train tracks.

1459
02:31:07,870 --> 02:31:08,430
Toot toot.

1460
02:31:08,430 --> 02:31:09,229
Oh, be careful.

1461
02:31:14,639 --> 02:31:14,959
Huh?

1462
02:31:15,600 --> 02:31:16,639
No, I love Cheez-Its.

1463
02:31:17,280 --> 02:31:31,739
I'm going to do the mission.

1464
02:31:31,739 --> 02:31:34,139
I'm going to do the mission.

1465
02:31:44,059 --> 02:31:45,020
He has headphones.

1466
02:31:45,020 --> 02:31:47,100
I only have one headphone in.

1467
02:31:47,100 --> 02:31:53,420
Look at all these players.

1468
02:31:55,930 --> 02:31:56,489
Where?

1469
02:31:56,489 --> 02:31:57,690
I need to go from here to there.

1470
02:31:57,690 --> 02:31:59,930
So I need to take the, didn't I already?

1471
02:31:59,930 --> 02:32:01,930
No, wait, does this take money from me?

1472
02:32:01,930 --> 02:32:03,370
How much money did I have before the game crashed?

1473
02:32:06,190 --> 02:32:07,389
If it took money from me when I did this,

1474
02:32:07,389 --> 02:32:08,750
I'm just bleeding money for no reason.

1475
02:32:11,120 --> 02:32:13,440
Go to the options menu to turn off voice chat.

1476
02:32:13,440 --> 02:32:14,000
I already did.

1477
02:32:16,909 --> 02:32:18,350
I mean, I already did that.

1478
02:32:23,799 --> 02:32:25,079
Honestly, you saw me do it.

1479
02:32:25,719 --> 02:32:26,520
You saw me do it.

1480
02:32:28,860 --> 02:32:29,340
I did it.

1481
02:32:29,340 --> 02:32:30,059
You watched me do it.

1482
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,139
You saw me do it.

1483
02:32:46,139 --> 02:32:46,860
You saw me do it.

1484
02:32:47,680 --> 02:32:48,079
Right here.

1485
02:32:52,409 --> 02:32:54,879
But what, what?

1486
02:32:54,879 --> 02:32:55,120
Okay.

1487
02:32:55,120 --> 02:32:56,239
What is this here for then?

1488
02:33:01,770 --> 02:33:02,329
That menu.

1489
02:33:03,819 --> 02:33:06,620
Why don't, why not just put off there?

1490
02:33:08,799 --> 02:33:10,159
That's only for the instance.

1491
02:33:12,090 --> 02:33:16,010
Oh, oh, all right.

1492
02:33:16,010 --> 02:33:16,809
Give me the stagecoach.

1493
02:33:22,409 --> 02:33:24,799
Right here.

1494
02:33:24,799 --> 02:33:25,760
Same for GTA.

1495
02:33:27,420 --> 02:33:28,139
Yeah, what the heck?

1496
02:33:36,879 --> 02:33:37,760
All right.

1497
02:33:37,760 --> 02:33:41,370
I need to go to, where was it?

1498
02:33:41,370 --> 02:33:41,930
Blackwater.

1499
02:33:44,649 --> 02:33:45,290
Blackwater.

1500
02:33:45,290 --> 02:33:46,250
We got to go there.

1501
02:33:46,969 --> 02:33:51,229
And I'm going to do the story mission with some online friends.

1502
02:33:52,030 --> 02:33:55,180
And by the way, it did take the money from me.

1503
02:33:55,180 --> 02:34:02,680
It processed the transaction.

1504
02:34:02,680 --> 02:34:03,879
And it may have just did it again.

1505
02:34:03,879 --> 02:34:05,159
And it may have just crashed it again.

1506
02:34:05,719 --> 02:34:09,260
It's taking more money from me.

1507
02:34:09,979 --> 02:34:14,200
I put in the dollar 50 and I pressed Mountain Dew.

1508
02:34:14,200 --> 02:34:15,639
That didn't fucking work.

1509
02:34:15,639 --> 02:34:17,239
And then I put another dollar in.

1510
02:34:17,239 --> 02:34:18,200
It's a dollar 50.

1511
02:34:18,200 --> 02:34:19,239
Didn't fucking work again.

1512
02:34:19,879 --> 02:34:20,840
What am I supposed to do?

1513
02:34:20,840 --> 02:34:21,719
Go get a manager?

1514
02:34:21,719 --> 02:34:23,639
They don't even operate these things.

1515
02:34:23,719 --> 02:34:25,959
I got to call the number on the back of the vending machine?

1516
02:34:26,840 --> 02:34:27,879
No, you're just going to leave.

1517
02:34:28,760 --> 02:34:44,120
Why did you do it two times?

1518
02:34:44,120 --> 02:34:45,879
Because you were really thirsty and there was your only option.

1519
02:34:45,879 --> 02:34:47,639
You thought maybe you could put a little bit more money and it would work.

1520
02:34:51,950 --> 02:34:53,709
Oh, I wonder what just happened.

1521
02:34:54,270 --> 02:34:57,399
You've been disconnected from Reddit and I'll do to a fault on the services.

1522
02:35:02,329 --> 02:35:04,409
And now it's never ending.

1523
02:35:04,409 --> 02:35:06,569
It's going to put me somewhere that I was before.

1524
02:35:07,209 --> 02:35:09,049
So I'm going to never endingly try.

1525
02:35:09,049 --> 02:35:10,649
I'm just going to fucking walk there.

1526
02:35:10,649 --> 02:35:11,770
I'm just going to walk there.

1527
02:35:11,770 --> 02:35:14,409
I'm going to get on the horse and I'm just going to walk there myself.

1528
02:35:15,290 --> 02:35:18,329
Every time I try to get there quicker, it just deletes me from the game.

1529
02:35:23,579 --> 02:35:33,120
For real.

1530
02:35:33,120 --> 02:35:35,200
Stop purchasing from the broken vending machine.

1531
02:35:35,920 --> 02:35:37,920
Play something else.

1532
02:35:39,450 --> 02:35:41,690
I mean, I could, I want to play this though.

1533
02:35:43,770 --> 02:35:46,250
This would be really fun if I could just play it.

1534
02:35:46,250 --> 02:35:48,250
And I have been able to in small snippets.

1535
02:35:49,879 --> 02:35:50,840
I want to play this.

1536
02:35:51,559 --> 02:35:52,680
I want to play this game.

1537
02:35:54,940 --> 02:35:57,899
I want a Mountain Dew from this machine.

1538
02:35:57,899 --> 02:36:00,780
I don't want to see Yara Mist from the other machine.

1539
02:36:00,780 --> 02:36:02,139
Even if that machine works.

1540
02:36:02,860 --> 02:36:03,899
I want a Mountain Dew.

1541
02:36:04,620 --> 02:36:19,659
How far away am I?

1542
02:36:19,659 --> 02:36:20,059
Let's see.

1543
02:36:23,340 --> 02:36:23,979
No.

1544
02:36:23,979 --> 02:36:24,139
All right.

1545
02:36:24,139 --> 02:36:24,860
Would you look at that?

1546
02:36:26,059 --> 02:36:26,540
Okay.

1547
02:36:26,540 --> 02:36:29,020
Please go across the entire video game again.

1548
02:36:29,020 --> 02:36:29,739
Is there a boat here?

1549
02:36:30,459 --> 02:36:31,479
I'm getting on a boat.

1550
02:36:32,360 --> 02:36:35,079
Give me a boat.

1551
02:36:37,149 --> 02:36:39,549
I will paddle across the whole ocean.

1552
02:36:39,549 --> 02:36:44,590
You can just choose where to log in.

1553
02:36:44,590 --> 02:36:44,909
Really?

1554
02:36:45,879 --> 02:36:52,090
Well, let me just do something bad here.

1555
02:36:58,280 --> 02:36:59,159
Boat through the rain.

1556
02:36:59,799 --> 02:37:04,010
Let's see if I can get a boat.

1557
02:37:05,120 --> 02:37:05,920
This is really cool.

1558
02:37:11,770 --> 02:37:13,690
Mountain Dew tastes like pee and marijuana.

1559
02:37:16,559 --> 02:37:17,280
I don't think...

1560
02:37:17,280 --> 02:37:19,280
Why do you know what those two things combined taste like?

1561
02:37:19,280 --> 02:37:21,520
I mean, I can understand knowing what they both taste like.

1562
02:37:22,239 --> 02:37:22,479
Right?

1563
02:37:23,120 --> 02:37:26,239
But why do you know what they taste like together?

1564
02:37:26,239 --> 02:37:46,719
All right.

1565
02:37:46,719 --> 02:37:52,090
So I'm just going across...

1566
02:37:52,090 --> 02:37:54,329
I'm just going across the whole Atlantic Ocean.

1567
02:37:55,370 --> 02:37:58,700
Why would you know what marijuana tastes like?

1568
02:38:01,020 --> 02:38:01,500
You can eat it.

1569
02:38:02,299 --> 02:38:06,010
Well, you don't eat the leaf.

1570
02:38:07,129 --> 02:38:07,370
Leaf.

1571
02:38:09,959 --> 02:38:10,600
Boil it down.

1572
02:38:11,479 --> 02:38:12,520
Smash it up.

1573
02:38:12,520 --> 02:38:14,200
Put it in a food processor.

1574
02:38:14,200 --> 02:38:14,840
And bake it.

1575
02:38:15,719 --> 02:38:20,379
And you add like corn syrup and sprinkle like cinnamon on it.

1576
02:38:20,379 --> 02:38:25,840
And then put like gelatin in it and mold it up into little shapes.

1577
02:38:25,840 --> 02:38:27,600
And then you have an edible.

1578
02:38:31,040 --> 02:38:31,440
All right.

1579
02:38:31,440 --> 02:38:32,319
I need a boat.

1580
02:38:32,319 --> 02:38:35,200
There's got to be a boat lined up here for some random idiot like me.

1581
02:38:36,159 --> 02:38:36,399
Yep.

1582
02:38:48,700 --> 02:38:48,940
All right.

1583
02:38:48,940 --> 02:38:49,899
That was the first one.

1584
02:38:51,040 --> 02:38:51,920
That was the first one.

1585
02:38:52,920 --> 02:38:53,959
I'll take that loss there.

1586
02:38:53,959 --> 02:38:55,479
That's two hours and 40 minutes, by the way.

1587
02:38:56,280 --> 02:38:58,219
That's how long it took.

1588
02:38:58,219 --> 02:38:58,780
That's a record.

1589
02:38:59,500 --> 02:39:01,280
And there's no boat here.

1590
02:39:03,280 --> 02:39:04,479
Wildly unfortunate.

1591
02:39:04,479 --> 02:39:05,120
But what is that?

1592
02:39:05,760 --> 02:39:10,940
It's a bucket.

1593
02:39:10,940 --> 02:39:11,659
God damn it.

1594
02:39:11,659 --> 02:39:11,979
Give me...

1595
02:39:11,979 --> 02:39:13,659
There's got to be a boat somewhere here.

1596
02:39:14,459 --> 02:39:19,930
There's no just canoe or rowboat just on the shore.

1597
02:39:19,930 --> 02:39:20,809
So I can just do this.

1598
02:39:21,770 --> 02:39:27,799
There's another hideout over here.

1599
02:39:27,799 --> 02:39:28,600
Do you have a boat?

1600
02:39:28,600 --> 02:39:29,559
That's all I care about.

1601
02:39:34,940 --> 02:39:36,459
Just swim, forehead.

1602
02:39:37,020 --> 02:40:06,319
How far is it?

1603
02:40:06,879 --> 02:40:10,780
I'm not even crossing the right...

1604
02:40:12,299 --> 02:40:13,260
Right place.

1605
02:40:15,020 --> 02:40:16,540
I'm going across...

1606
02:40:16,540 --> 02:40:17,340
I'm swimming.

1607
02:40:18,299 --> 02:40:21,819
Let's just go across the English Channel rather than the Atlantic.

1608
02:40:22,780 --> 02:40:35,159
Hey, this is the way to build stamina.

1609
02:40:35,159 --> 02:40:35,719
That's for sure.

1610
02:40:36,520 --> 02:40:42,270
It's going to take longer to swim than ride your horse.

1611
02:40:43,149 --> 02:40:43,950
I know.

1612
02:40:43,950 --> 02:40:44,110
But...

1613
02:40:44,750 --> 02:40:45,229
And I didn't...

1614
02:40:45,229 --> 02:40:46,909
What did I even do here?

1615
02:40:46,909 --> 02:40:47,309
I just...

1616
02:40:47,309 --> 02:40:57,069
I would have already been there if I didn't get the stop blue screen error code X0X00021.

1617
02:40:57,069 --> 02:40:57,950
What the hell it was.

1618
02:41:07,209 --> 02:41:07,690
Options.

1619
02:41:07,690 --> 02:41:08,409
Press the options button.

1620
02:41:08,409 --> 02:41:09,850
Select online and go to free room.

1621
02:41:09,850 --> 02:41:11,610
And then West Elizabeth.

1622
02:41:11,610 --> 02:41:16,000
How do I select where I want to go?

1623
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:16,399
Free room.

1624
02:41:16,399 --> 02:41:16,959
I'm right where it is.

1625
02:41:17,770 --> 02:41:18,250
Where it is.

1626
02:41:18,250 --> 02:41:18,729
There it is.

1627
02:41:19,370 --> 02:41:19,930
Thank you.

1628
02:41:29,309 --> 02:41:32,110
Just jump on each water droplet until you get there.

1629
02:41:50,479 --> 02:41:55,120
Wouldn't that mean that the rain is solid to a point where you can stand on it?

1630
02:41:55,120 --> 02:41:58,639
Which means it can carry and hold enough weight for you to stand on it.

1631
02:41:59,200 --> 02:42:05,209
Therefore, all life is wiped out because you're essentially dropping tiny little concrete

1632
02:42:05,209 --> 02:42:06,250
bricks on everything.

1633
02:42:06,250 --> 02:42:06,969
On every person.

1634
02:42:06,969 --> 02:42:07,530
On everything.

1635
02:42:07,530 --> 02:42:08,170
And every animal.

1636
02:42:08,170 --> 02:42:08,729
Every tree.

1637
02:42:18,719 --> 02:42:19,520
I guess so, yeah.

1638
02:42:20,799 --> 02:42:21,440
Like hail.

1639
02:42:21,440 --> 02:42:22,719
But you can't stand on hail.

1640
02:42:24,139 --> 02:42:30,889
If it was two pounds per pebble and hundreds of millions of them were falling at the

1641
02:42:30,889 --> 02:42:31,850
same time.

1642
02:42:31,850 --> 02:42:39,870
You would just turn everybody into a giant food processor.

1643
02:42:39,870 --> 02:42:41,709
We'd be inside the stomach of a turkey.

1644
02:42:44,860 --> 02:42:48,399
Turkeys eat rocks to digest all the food.

1645
02:42:49,290 --> 02:42:50,010
That's what would happen.

1646
02:42:50,729 --> 02:42:51,770
Well, we're already here.

1647
02:42:52,329 --> 02:42:52,889
We made it.

1648
02:42:52,889 --> 02:42:53,290
Finally.

1649
02:42:54,170 --> 02:42:55,049
We're in Blackwater.

1650
02:43:00,200 --> 02:43:00,840
What's this mean?

1651
02:43:36,719 --> 02:43:38,399
Why is he chasing after the wagon?

1652
02:43:39,040 --> 02:43:42,989
How do I whistle to him?

1653
02:43:43,790 --> 02:43:45,309
A rival posse has started the mission.

1654
02:43:45,309 --> 02:43:46,110
Eliminate the target!

1655
02:43:46,110 --> 02:43:58,159
Hey, slow down!

1656
02:43:58,159 --> 02:44:01,360
Is that, no, that's, that, this is me from the past.

1657
02:44:02,079 --> 02:44:24,280
Can I actually get him in this?

1658
02:44:28,920 --> 02:44:29,959
Oh my god.

1659
02:44:32,860 --> 02:44:33,360
What?

1660
02:44:56,299 --> 02:44:59,260
That was fucking funny.

1661
02:44:59,819 --> 02:45:05,739
Who the fuck are you?

1662
02:45:06,299 --> 02:45:07,100
Oh shit, it's you!

1663
02:45:07,979 --> 02:45:08,459
I got him!

1664
02:45:09,100 --> 02:45:10,139
It was lag.

1665
02:45:10,139 --> 02:45:11,020
A little bit of lag there.

1666
02:45:25,200 --> 02:45:27,040
So if you get somebody in the last oak,

1667
02:45:27,040 --> 02:45:29,920
and I like to hide them out, actually, like hog-tie them?

1668
02:45:35,850 --> 02:45:36,329
No.

1669
02:45:36,329 --> 02:45:39,129
So that's why, because that's what I've always taken so long to do.

1670
02:45:46,319 --> 02:45:47,040
What?

1671
02:45:47,040 --> 02:46:08,379
It's not fair.

1672
02:46:08,379 --> 02:46:10,299
There's like three people there as friends.

1673
02:46:10,299 --> 02:46:11,260
Where are my friends?

1674
02:46:12,059 --> 02:46:17,629
I'm just a random fucking farmer from down the road that heard noise outside of his house.

1675
02:46:18,350 --> 02:46:21,079
What's all that racket out here, you little bastards?

1676
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:50,360
It's a four-band party.

1677
02:46:50,360 --> 02:46:51,479
One, two, three, four.

1678
02:46:51,479 --> 02:46:53,469
Me and my shitty horse.

1679
02:46:53,469 --> 02:47:09,200
And then this guy.

1680
02:47:09,200 --> 02:47:10,959
Sean is not a shitty horse.

1681
02:47:10,959 --> 02:47:11,760
All right, fuck this.

1682
02:47:12,639 --> 02:47:14,719
You want to see the real Red Dead Redemption?

1683
02:47:16,409 --> 02:47:19,690
Called Farmer Joe was going full speed into the fucking party of four.

1684
02:47:20,489 --> 02:47:32,040
That wasn't even one of them.

1685
02:47:36,440 --> 02:47:37,799
That wasn't even one of them.

1686
02:47:37,799 --> 02:47:40,520
And they, I fell off my horse, but they didn't.

1687
02:47:41,159 --> 02:47:42,200
Fucking typical.

1688
02:47:42,200 --> 02:47:43,000
My horse is dead.

1689
02:48:10,090 --> 02:48:11,530
Thank god for horse insurance.

1690
02:48:18,459 --> 02:48:19,659
Rockstar Online.

1691
02:48:21,639 --> 02:48:25,559
Just get in a party of four and bully the farmer that's level five.

1692
02:48:26,200 --> 02:48:31,370
I gotta like do something.

1693
02:48:31,370 --> 02:48:31,690
Fuck it.

1694
02:48:31,690 --> 02:48:32,809
I gotta fuck something up here.

1695
02:48:40,889 --> 02:48:41,690
Who the fuck is that?

1696
02:48:42,649 --> 02:48:43,049
We are friends.

1697
02:48:43,049 --> 02:48:43,610
We're friends, right?

1698
02:48:43,610 --> 02:48:44,010
We're friends.

1699
02:48:44,010 --> 02:48:44,409
We're friends.

1700
02:48:44,409 --> 02:48:45,049
We're friends, right?

1701
02:48:45,049 --> 02:48:45,850
You and I are friends.

1702
02:48:46,489 --> 02:48:47,579
Let me get on your horse.

1703
02:48:47,579 --> 02:48:48,379
We have to work together.

1704
02:48:49,100 --> 02:48:51,739
Don't you stand?

1705
02:48:52,379 --> 02:48:56,590
Hi, Sean.

1706
02:48:56,590 --> 02:49:06,799
Good luck doing anything with your old man hands.

1707
02:49:06,799 --> 02:49:09,200
All right, I don't want to go that way, but they're in the town too.

1708
02:49:14,430 --> 02:49:16,030
At least maybe the lawmen will come out.

1709
02:49:16,670 --> 02:49:21,229
Who is hanging out over here?

1710
02:49:21,229 --> 02:49:22,350
Oh god, he's on the road.

1711
02:49:23,069 --> 02:49:43,659
I got my revenge.

1712
02:49:43,659 --> 02:49:44,379
I don't even care.

1713
02:49:48,350 --> 02:49:49,549
I was trying to run him over.

1714
02:49:50,190 --> 02:49:59,899
Wait, that wasn't them?

1715
02:50:00,459 --> 02:50:04,299
That was the guy that had the star on his name, right?

1716
02:50:05,020 --> 02:50:21,319
What is this guy doing?

1717
02:50:21,319 --> 02:50:22,860
Are you friendly?

1718
02:50:26,239 --> 02:50:27,680
All right, hold on.

1719
02:50:27,680 --> 02:50:28,799
What's the emote?

1720
02:50:28,799 --> 02:50:32,700
How do you emote?

1721
02:50:32,700 --> 02:50:35,799
I'm trying to prove.

1722
02:50:35,799 --> 02:50:37,000
No, put the knife away.

1723
02:50:39,440 --> 02:50:39,760
Okay.

1724
02:50:51,049 --> 02:50:51,690
Okay.

1725
02:50:51,690 --> 02:50:54,600
He doesn't want to kill me.

1726
02:50:54,600 --> 02:51:15,559
Good.

1727
02:51:15,559 --> 02:51:21,200
It seems to start with the absolute most, the worst possible moments, right?

1728
02:51:21,920 --> 02:51:24,159
Oh, look, there's a guy there.

1729
02:51:24,159 --> 02:51:27,600
Are you going to maybe make a friend and go do some stuff?

1730
02:51:27,600 --> 02:51:30,319
Oh, you're doing really well in this online session where you're probably for...

1731
02:51:30,319 --> 02:51:31,440
No, no, no.

1732
02:51:37,760 --> 02:51:41,680
Yeah, only when I get fucking bullied is when they want to keep the servers on.

1733
02:51:50,600 --> 02:51:52,920
I've played 14 hours and have never gotten kicked.

1734
02:51:54,920 --> 02:51:55,879
I wonder why it's...

1735
02:51:55,879 --> 02:51:57,399
I mean, is this happening to anybody else?

1736
02:52:03,159 --> 02:52:05,000
Or is this just a...

1737
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:06,200
Is this just a me problem?

1738
02:52:06,840 --> 02:52:11,239
Yeah, it's happening to you.

1739
02:52:11,239 --> 02:52:12,120
Yeah, me, me, me.

1740
02:52:12,920 --> 02:52:14,670
Rock it.

1741
02:52:14,670 --> 02:52:15,549
All right, come on.

1742
02:52:16,430 --> 02:52:17,870
I want to play this.

1743
02:52:17,870 --> 02:52:19,069
I just got two in a row.

1744
02:52:20,120 --> 02:52:22,280
I got the one with the two and now I got one with the nine.

1745
02:52:23,159 --> 02:52:25,049
Now it won't even let me exit the game.

1746
02:52:30,329 --> 02:52:30,889
I'm gonna...

1747
02:52:30,889 --> 02:52:31,370
I'm gonna...

1748
02:52:31,370 --> 02:52:32,489
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

1749
02:52:32,489 --> 02:52:33,370
Let me go take a piss.

1750
02:52:34,250 --> 02:52:34,969
I'll be right back.

1751
02:52:34,969 --> 02:52:36,649
I'm gonna exit, restart.

1752
02:52:36,649 --> 02:52:37,610
We'll try it one more time.

1753
02:52:40,239 --> 02:52:41,200
I want to play this.

1754
02:52:41,760 --> 02:52:44,280
This is what I want to play, but I can't do it.

1755
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:46,680
Well, I can, but just for not very long.

1756
02:52:48,510 --> 02:52:49,549
Give me one second.

1757
02:52:49,549 --> 02:52:50,989
I'm gonna grab another water and take a piss.

1758
02:52:51,629 --> 02:52:52,969
See you soon.

1759
02:52:52,969 --> 02:56:16,329
I can't open it.

1760
02:56:16,329 --> 02:56:17,370
I'm not strong enough to open this.

1761
02:56:19,819 --> 02:56:20,459
What the fuck?

1762
02:56:22,159 --> 02:56:23,040
God damn it.

1763
02:56:24,620 --> 02:56:25,180
Okay, I got it.

1764
02:56:27,950 --> 02:56:28,670
Mountain Dew.

1765
02:56:29,389 --> 02:56:36,040
Let's go back into this.

1766
02:56:36,040 --> 02:56:36,520
Try it again.

1767
02:56:42,159 --> 02:56:43,040
All right.

1768
02:56:43,040 --> 02:56:43,920
I'm gonna restart it.

1769
02:56:47,559 --> 02:56:48,840
I shouldn't have to do this.

1770
02:56:49,799 --> 02:56:50,680
Rock star.

1771
02:56:51,479 --> 02:57:00,829
I'll fuck some people up online.

1772
02:57:00,829 --> 02:57:01,549
I'm trying.

1773
02:57:02,190 --> 02:57:07,500
I'm trying to get it done.

1774
02:57:13,450 --> 02:57:15,370
Please drink verification.

1775
02:57:15,370 --> 02:57:15,870
What?

1776
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:21,799
All right, here we go.

1777
02:57:21,799 --> 02:57:22,299
Let's go.

1778
02:57:33,049 --> 02:57:33,930
Oh, it's from...

1779
02:57:33,930 --> 02:57:34,809
It's from meme.

1780
02:57:36,170 --> 02:57:37,049
I see.

1781
02:57:37,049 --> 02:57:37,610
I get it.

1782
02:57:38,329 --> 02:57:39,770
Well, actually, I don't get it.

1783
02:57:40,409 --> 02:57:42,010
I don't know what you mean by that.

1784
02:57:42,809 --> 02:57:44,969
But I get that it's a reference to something.

1785
02:57:45,530 --> 02:57:55,360
Do I still drink Dr. Pepper?

1786
02:57:55,360 --> 02:57:57,280
I don't really drink soda that much anymore.

1787
02:57:57,920 --> 02:58:03,100
Except when it's an ice cold,

1788
02:58:03,899 --> 02:58:05,840
frothy Mountain Dew.

1789
02:58:06,399 --> 02:58:10,520
That's a Coke, by the way.

1790
02:58:10,520 --> 02:58:11,719
That's a Coke Coke.

1791
02:58:11,719 --> 02:58:18,329
And yeah, I drink probably like a soda.

1792
02:58:19,049 --> 02:58:20,969
Maybe like two sodas a week.

1793
02:58:21,770 --> 02:58:22,649
Once a week, maybe.

1794
02:58:23,370 --> 02:58:24,969
I drink a lot more water than anything else.

1795
02:58:26,059 --> 02:58:26,620
Nowadays.

1796
02:58:27,340 --> 02:58:30,569
No, not diet.

1797
02:58:31,129 --> 02:58:33,020
I don't drink diet soda.

1798
02:58:33,659 --> 02:58:45,930
Imagine drinking water?

1799
02:58:47,309 --> 02:58:47,950
What is gross?

1800
02:58:47,950 --> 02:58:48,989
What's wrong with water?

1801
02:58:48,989 --> 02:58:50,030
What, you guys don't like water?

1802
02:58:50,909 --> 02:59:00,670
I mean, water is boring, but you have to drink it.

1803
02:59:01,469 --> 02:59:03,600
Otherwise, you'll turn into...

1804
02:59:03,600 --> 02:59:04,879
You'll shrivel up into dust.

1805
02:59:05,680 --> 02:59:07,500
All right, where the hell am I?

1806
02:59:07,500 --> 02:59:07,899
Didn't I...

1807
02:59:07,899 --> 02:59:09,260
Didn't I select black water?

1808
02:59:09,979 --> 02:59:12,620
Why am I all the way over here?

1809
02:59:13,260 --> 02:59:15,450
No, I'm going to just...

1810
02:59:16,090 --> 02:59:20,000
I'm going to take what I can get at this point.

1811
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:21,120
I want to do this mission.

1812
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:24,719
I'm going to get on the horse and I'm going to walk to that mission.

1813
02:59:24,719 --> 02:59:26,879
I'm going to stand in the circle and go to the mission.

1814
02:59:28,030 --> 02:59:29,229
That's what I'm going to do.

1815
02:59:31,209 --> 02:59:32,090
Water is not boring?

1816
02:59:32,090 --> 02:59:33,850
Well, boring in the sense that it doesn't...

1817
02:59:33,850 --> 02:59:35,129
That water doesn't have like a taste.

1818
02:59:37,079 --> 02:59:38,280
It is just tasteless.

1819
02:59:39,610 --> 02:59:41,770
Tasteless, colorless, no additives.

1820
02:59:41,770 --> 02:59:42,409
It's just nothing.

1821
02:59:42,409 --> 02:59:44,010
It's just there and you need it.

1822
02:59:46,010 --> 02:59:47,450
You know, you have no horses.

1823
02:59:51,680 --> 02:59:52,639
What happened to my other horse?

1824
03:00:01,840 --> 03:00:02,719
It got deleted?

1825
03:00:03,360 --> 03:00:04,780
Well, why is that?

1826
03:00:11,129 --> 03:00:12,170
Come here, you little shit.

1827
03:00:12,889 --> 03:00:20,430
Why can I not...

1828
03:00:22,170 --> 03:00:22,569
Whatever.

1829
03:00:26,239 --> 03:00:26,799
All right, let's go.

1830
03:00:33,290 --> 03:00:35,500
I'm not going to shoot it.

1831
03:00:35,500 --> 03:00:36,940
I don't need it right now.

1832
03:00:36,940 --> 03:00:40,299
I need to just stay focused and go straight on the GPS.

1833
03:00:41,340 --> 03:00:43,709
Get to the mission and hope that I can do it.

1834
03:00:44,350 --> 03:00:48,670
And enjoy myself in RDR2-O.

1835
03:00:49,629 --> 03:00:51,629
RDR2-O.

1836
03:00:52,270 --> 03:00:56,639
I hate that title now.

1837
03:00:57,280 --> 03:01:00,969
That title was just a stupid reference I was making with like

1838
03:01:00,969 --> 03:01:02,010
100 people in the chat.

1839
03:01:02,809 --> 03:01:09,920
I'm changing it to that.

1840
03:01:29,659 --> 03:01:33,819
Yeah, that was like an IGN Plays Red Dead Online reference.

1841
03:01:34,700 --> 03:01:38,399
Yeah, that's better.

1842
03:01:40,489 --> 03:01:43,209
The lawless land of RDR2-Online.

1843
03:01:43,930 --> 03:01:57,690
Don't run into him, please.

1844
03:01:57,690 --> 03:01:58,090
Shut up.

1845
03:01:58,090 --> 03:01:58,409
What?

1846
03:01:58,409 --> 03:01:59,450
Why did you tell me to shut up?

1847
03:01:59,450 --> 03:02:00,409
Why did you say that, you?

1848
03:02:00,409 --> 03:02:01,049
Why did you say that?

1849
03:02:10,170 --> 03:02:11,450
Yeah, shut up.

1850
03:02:11,450 --> 03:02:19,920
I gotta be careful.

1851
03:02:19,920 --> 03:02:20,639
I'm almost there.

1852
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:27,360
Just let the Rockstar servers stay online

1853
03:02:27,360 --> 03:02:29,200
for me to play another mission with people.

1854
03:02:30,159 --> 03:02:43,370
Almost there.

1855
03:02:44,090 --> 03:02:45,370
I'm going to go very slow too.

1856
03:02:45,370 --> 03:02:46,090
I'm going to get off the horse.

1857
03:02:46,090 --> 03:02:47,209
I'm going to walk into the marker

1858
03:02:48,329 --> 03:02:49,690
because maybe I'm just going too fast

1859
03:02:49,690 --> 03:02:51,049
and the game is trying to transition me

1860
03:02:51,049 --> 03:02:52,409
to another instance or another server

1861
03:02:52,409 --> 03:02:53,450
and it's just kicking me out.

1862
03:03:03,040 --> 03:03:04,239
Where are all the random events?

1863
03:03:07,579 --> 03:03:08,459
That's a good question.

1864
03:03:10,700 --> 03:03:15,579
I think they're the peach markers on the screen, right?

1865
03:03:16,139 --> 03:03:18,459
Aren't those the new random kind of stranger events?

1866
03:03:19,260 --> 03:03:23,600
I'm almost there.

1867
03:03:24,559 --> 03:03:25,920
Come on, just get me over there

1868
03:03:25,920 --> 03:03:27,680
and I'm going to walk off the horse.

1869
03:03:30,510 --> 03:03:31,870
Okay, slowly.

1870
03:03:32,590 --> 03:03:33,870
Let it load what I want to do.

1871
03:03:37,420 --> 03:03:39,819
Compete with other players in free roam events.

1872
03:03:39,819 --> 03:03:40,700
Dispatch rider.

1873
03:03:50,889 --> 03:03:51,530
No, no.

1874
03:03:53,690 --> 03:03:54,409
No!

1875
03:03:54,409 --> 03:03:55,530
I should have just done it.

1876
03:03:55,530 --> 03:03:57,690
I should have just walked into the circle.

1877
03:03:57,690 --> 03:03:59,129
I had an opportunity to do it

1878
03:03:59,129 --> 03:04:00,010
and I didn't do it.

1879
03:04:23,239 --> 03:04:24,680
Small indie company.

1880
03:04:26,700 --> 03:04:28,379
We are testing the servers

1881
03:04:28,379 --> 03:04:31,260
so hopefully they're getting all the data that they need.

1882
03:04:31,899 --> 03:04:36,030
This is a QA data.

1883
03:04:36,829 --> 03:04:41,309
Data beta test stream.

1884
03:04:41,309 --> 03:04:43,469
You're watching live QA is what you're...

1885
03:04:43,469 --> 03:04:44,829
I'm not broadcasting Red Dead,

1886
03:04:44,829 --> 03:04:46,190
I'm broadcasting testing.

1887
03:04:46,829 --> 03:04:48,430
I guess that is what I'm doing.

1888
03:04:48,430 --> 03:05:12,719
And why am I playing just to suffer?

1889
03:05:13,440 --> 03:05:15,790
Because I feel like when it works,

1890
03:05:15,790 --> 03:05:17,389
it's going to be fun and it has

1891
03:05:17,389 --> 03:05:19,069
and when it does work, it's interesting.

1892
03:05:21,600 --> 03:05:22,959
And now I'm back here again.

1893
03:05:25,239 --> 03:05:26,360
I'm going to go...

1894
03:05:26,360 --> 03:05:27,319
No, I don't want to do that.

1895
03:05:27,959 --> 03:05:29,399
Just go to the map.

1896
03:05:29,399 --> 03:05:30,040
Where am I?

1897
03:05:31,639 --> 03:05:34,840
I'm so much further away now than I was before.

1898
03:05:34,840 --> 03:05:36,840
This is just unbelievable.

1899
03:05:37,639 --> 03:05:42,889
This really is turning into suffering at this point.

1900
03:05:42,889 --> 03:05:44,250
But I want to do it.

1901
03:05:44,250 --> 03:05:45,209
I want to play it.

1902
03:05:50,250 --> 03:05:51,209
Here comes a bad review.

1903
03:05:58,329 --> 03:05:59,370
Just buy a plane.

1904
03:05:59,930 --> 03:06:07,870
Just reload until I spawn there.

1905
03:06:07,870 --> 03:06:09,069
I could probably get there faster

1906
03:06:09,069 --> 03:06:10,510
than reloading the game one time.

1907
03:06:19,239 --> 03:06:19,850
Okay.

1908
03:06:20,729 --> 03:06:21,819
Don't do anything.

1909
03:06:23,370 --> 03:06:24,809
Just get there.

1910
03:06:24,809 --> 03:06:25,450
Don't do anything.

1911
03:06:25,450 --> 03:06:26,170
Don't say anything.

1912
03:06:28,159 --> 03:06:31,280
I was fucking reading the chat

1913
03:06:31,280 --> 03:06:32,319
because I was seeing...

1914
03:06:34,639 --> 03:06:35,200
Don't do it.

1915
03:06:37,319 --> 03:06:37,879
Just forget them.

1916
03:06:44,809 --> 03:06:46,489
I couldn't even control it.

1917
03:06:47,610 --> 03:06:48,409
I couldn't turn.

1918
03:06:49,770 --> 03:06:50,329
Pull it back.

1919
03:06:50,329 --> 03:06:51,290
Pull it back.

1920
03:06:51,290 --> 03:06:52,969
I want you to pull it back.

1921
03:06:52,969 --> 03:06:53,930
Pull it back.

1922
03:06:53,930 --> 03:06:55,049
Give me a clip of that.

1923
03:06:55,049 --> 03:06:56,010
I'm not fucking around.

1924
03:06:56,010 --> 03:06:57,209
Clip that because you can hear me

1925
03:06:57,209 --> 03:06:58,569
press right on the stick.

1926
03:07:00,270 --> 03:07:01,870
Clip it and show it to me right now.

1927
03:07:02,590 --> 03:07:13,209
Listen to this.

1928
03:07:13,209 --> 03:07:15,899
I want you to listen to the click of the analog.

1929
03:07:16,459 --> 03:07:24,159
Fucking reading the chat

1930
03:07:24,159 --> 03:07:25,200
because I was seeing...

1931
03:07:26,079 --> 03:07:26,799
Let's hear the click.

1932
03:07:27,520 --> 03:07:28,079
Don't do it.

1933
03:07:30,190 --> 03:07:30,829
Just forget them.

1934
03:07:44,760 --> 03:07:45,319
Do you hear that?

1935
03:07:45,319 --> 03:07:46,360
Do you hear the click?

1936
03:07:46,360 --> 03:07:47,530
Listen to it one more time.

1937
03:07:47,530 --> 03:07:47,850
Right with the...

1938
03:07:48,729 --> 03:07:59,420
I couldn't even control it.

1939
03:07:59,979 --> 03:08:03,520
I couldn't control it.

1940
03:08:10,649 --> 03:08:12,250
This is a slight click.

1941
03:08:12,250 --> 03:08:13,930
No, I swear to God.

1942
03:08:13,930 --> 03:08:15,610
I've done dumb things before.

1943
03:08:15,610 --> 03:08:17,129
I've fallen off fucking cliffs.

1944
03:08:17,209 --> 03:08:46,270
You see, I'm laughing because, okay, I felt that...

1945
03:08:46,270 --> 03:08:49,069
I told you, I fucking am absent-minded.

1946
03:08:49,069 --> 03:08:50,590
Some dumb shit happens.

1947
03:08:50,590 --> 03:08:52,190
But that was not the case that time.

1948
03:08:52,750 --> 03:08:53,709
Just get me to the mission.

1949
03:08:53,709 --> 03:08:54,750
This would not have happened

1950
03:08:54,750 --> 03:08:55,790
if I could just play the game

1951
03:08:55,790 --> 03:08:58,110
that I wanted to play like 40 minutes ago.

1952
03:09:02,159 --> 03:09:03,280
Okay, I think it's time to stop.

1953
03:09:32,190 --> 03:09:33,709
Superior Vegas internet.

1954
03:09:33,709 --> 03:09:34,750
That's not my internet.

1955
03:09:34,750 --> 03:09:35,389
That's not me.

1956
03:09:36,639 --> 03:09:38,639
I'm losing the connection to...

1957
03:09:38,639 --> 03:09:39,680
Their server's a drop,

1958
03:09:39,680 --> 03:09:41,200
but that didn't do anything.

1959
03:09:45,690 --> 03:09:46,729
Try again another day.

1960
03:09:46,729 --> 03:09:48,010
What is here is probably fun.

1961
03:09:48,569 --> 03:09:54,729
I mean, I really wanted to...

1962
03:09:55,370 --> 03:09:58,329
I really wanted to save Jackbox for Friday

1963
03:09:58,329 --> 03:09:59,850
because we could do it the whole time

1964
03:09:59,850 --> 03:10:02,489
and we could spend like five, six, seven hours in it.

1965
03:10:09,610 --> 03:10:17,309
Because, I mean, it's not like I have a time limit

1966
03:10:17,309 --> 03:10:20,989
for the streams, but I usually start to get pretty tired

1967
03:10:21,629 --> 03:10:24,110
after like five or six hours streaming.

1968
03:10:24,829 --> 03:10:27,870
And then at about six to eight

1969
03:10:27,870 --> 03:10:29,549
is where I usually call it a night.

1970
03:10:30,110 --> 03:10:31,399
And I really don't want to...

1971
03:10:31,399 --> 03:10:32,920
I want to give it the time it deserves.

1972
03:10:32,920 --> 03:10:34,440
That's what we're doing on Friday.

1973
03:10:34,440 --> 03:10:37,639
Stick to the plan.

1974
03:10:38,440 --> 03:10:43,799
I'm there, I'm there, I'm there, I'm there.

1975
03:10:45,239 --> 03:10:45,639
Hold on.

1976
03:10:46,200 --> 03:10:49,120
Didn't have time to kick me out.

1977
03:10:49,120 --> 03:10:49,680
I just got in.

1978
03:10:49,680 --> 03:10:50,559
It's like currently beeping.

1979
03:10:50,559 --> 03:10:51,440
It's currently beeping to get me...

1980
03:10:51,440 --> 03:10:54,559
I got it, I got it, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in.

1981
03:10:54,559 --> 03:10:57,100
Didn't have time to kick me out.

1982
03:10:57,100 --> 03:10:57,579
I just connected.

1983
03:11:01,309 --> 03:11:09,020
Oh, whoops.

1984
03:11:09,659 --> 03:11:12,489
Oh, it's a strange one, Horley.

1985
03:11:12,489 --> 03:11:12,969
We're good.

1986
03:11:12,969 --> 03:11:14,329
How is this little clerk?

1987
03:11:14,329 --> 03:11:15,610
How bad is you'd expect?

1988
03:11:15,610 --> 03:11:16,729
I expect a lot.

1989
03:11:19,290 --> 03:11:22,649
The clerk was a good man and a fine man.

1990
03:11:22,649 --> 03:11:23,370
That he was.

1991
03:11:24,170 --> 03:11:25,370
And this fella?

1992
03:11:25,370 --> 03:11:26,649
Well, that's their business.

1993
03:11:26,649 --> 03:11:28,729
Sorry, it's my first time streaming, yeah.

1994
03:11:28,729 --> 03:11:36,250
The world's business is kindness and gentleness and evil and brutality.

1995
03:11:36,250 --> 03:11:37,610
What else is there, mister?

1996
03:11:37,610 --> 03:11:44,270
Well, there's a whole lot else besides like lust and greed and stupidity.

1997
03:11:44,829 --> 03:11:47,870
Oh, mister Jones is stupid.

1998
03:11:47,870 --> 03:11:50,110
Oh, Jones is old.

1999
03:11:50,110 --> 03:11:53,549
Oh, Jones has cooked himself in the sun.

2000
03:11:53,549 --> 03:11:54,750
I know, I know.

2001
03:11:54,750 --> 03:11:56,190
Get yourself something to eat.

2002
03:11:56,190 --> 03:11:57,549
There's fellas need help.

2003
03:11:58,350 --> 03:12:00,270
Maybe this fella can help them.

2004
03:12:00,270 --> 03:12:00,670
Maybe.

2005
03:12:01,870 --> 03:12:03,149
They're on the run.

2006
03:12:03,149 --> 03:12:03,950
Did they beat the game?

2007
03:12:03,950 --> 03:12:04,590
I did not.

2008
03:12:04,590 --> 03:12:07,549
I had about the 43, 44% time.

2009
03:12:07,549 --> 03:12:11,319
My business is what they do hereafter.

2010
03:12:12,329 --> 03:12:13,530
That's my business.

2011
03:12:13,530 --> 03:12:15,049
Well, they certainly need money.

2012
03:12:15,530 --> 03:12:16,809
There's always money.

2013
03:12:17,450 --> 03:12:21,450
Money for them is as good and money for them is not so good.

2014
03:12:25,530 --> 03:12:30,010
By the way, make sure everyone is aware because this is the last time I'm going to be able

2015
03:12:30,010 --> 03:12:30,649
to talk about it.

2016
03:12:32,729 --> 03:12:35,690
If you have a, did I just make money?

2017
03:12:35,690 --> 03:12:36,969
Did somebody just take money from me?

2018
03:12:36,969 --> 03:12:40,010
You might as well try the sheriff at Blackwater.

2019
03:12:40,010 --> 03:12:40,729
He needs help.

2020
03:12:40,729 --> 03:12:41,129
That was weird.

2021
03:12:45,049 --> 03:12:47,290
I'm not streaming tomorrow so this is the last time I'm going to be able

2022
03:12:47,290 --> 03:12:53,770
to talk about it before Saturday or Friday, and at that point it's too late.

2023
03:12:53,770 --> 03:13:04,010
So as of tomorrow, midnight tomorrow, midnight tomorrow, Pacific or Eastern, I'm not sure.

2024
03:13:04,010 --> 03:13:09,209
But tomorrow night late is your last opportunity to put a submission in for the movie night.

2025
03:13:12,569 --> 03:13:14,090
Thursday, tomorrow night.

2026
03:13:14,569 --> 03:13:16,889
Meet me back here after you've seen them.

2027
03:13:16,889 --> 03:13:23,309
If you do not have a submission in, then you are not eligible for Sunday's movie night.

2028
03:13:28,510 --> 03:13:34,590
Now, I've seen some people say, hey, my submission is is two minutes and 40 seconds.

2029
03:13:34,590 --> 03:13:36,270
My submissions is three minutes.

2030
03:13:36,270 --> 03:13:36,989
Can you show this?

2031
03:13:36,989 --> 03:13:38,030
It's like three and a half minutes.

2032
03:13:39,309 --> 03:13:40,670
Not for not for Sunday.

2033
03:13:44,040 --> 03:13:50,040
Sunday is strictly for these submissions in that channel.

2034
03:13:50,680 --> 03:13:56,680
If you go to the Discord and the movie night channel,

2035
03:13:57,479 --> 03:14:00,520
follow the very specific rules that are pinned there in that channel.

2036
03:14:01,479 --> 03:14:06,250
I don't have a horse so we have to what do I have to go all is there anybody

2037
03:14:06,250 --> 03:14:06,969
even doing this with me?

2038
03:14:15,149 --> 03:14:27,290
I mean at this point I can't I can't load into free room.

2039
03:14:29,049 --> 03:14:31,370
I have to I have to just like go to single player or something,

2040
03:14:31,370 --> 03:14:33,129
but that's not what I wanted to do.

2041
03:14:34,010 --> 03:14:34,969
It's such annoying.

2042
03:14:35,370 --> 03:14:43,149
Uh, yeah, I can't just keep trying.

2043
03:14:43,870 --> 03:14:45,790
I'm going to try tomorrow the next night.

2044
03:14:45,790 --> 03:14:46,430
No, not tomorrow.

2045
03:14:46,430 --> 03:14:47,469
I can't not stream tomorrow.

2046
03:14:48,510 --> 03:14:58,569
Um, load in a different place.

2047
03:15:00,409 --> 03:15:01,370
Not West Elizabeth.

2048
03:15:03,229 --> 03:15:07,229
Yeah, but even when I was in these, I was dumping out on these two.

2049
03:15:08,190 --> 03:15:10,510
Remember I was doing exceptionally well.

2050
03:15:11,069 --> 03:15:11,950
I got disconnected.

2051
03:15:16,760 --> 03:15:17,879
Load in New Austin.

2052
03:15:18,440 --> 03:15:23,549
Well, for the purposes of can I change my region?

2053
03:15:23,549 --> 03:15:24,430
No, I don't think so.

2054
03:15:25,309 --> 03:15:27,129
I don't think there's any way to do that.

2055
03:15:28,879 --> 03:15:29,360
All right.

2056
03:15:29,360 --> 03:15:30,719
I'm here's what is going to happen.

2057
03:15:32,079 --> 03:15:33,440
Uh, I'm going to load.

2058
03:15:33,440 --> 03:15:36,399
I'm going to try one more time in a different place.

2059
03:15:37,120 --> 03:15:41,680
And if it doesn't work, then I'm just going to go play fucking Peggle 2.

2060
03:15:42,639 --> 03:15:45,159
For like an hour or two or something.

2061
03:15:46,399 --> 03:15:46,959
God damn it.

2062
03:15:46,959 --> 03:15:52,170
That's so the load of story mode or I don't know.

2063
03:15:52,170 --> 03:15:52,889
Let's try it again.

2064
03:15:53,530 --> 03:15:58,000
You gotta have faith.

2065
03:15:58,639 --> 03:16:01,959
Well, sorry to all those people watching that.

2066
03:16:01,959 --> 03:16:04,360
We're expecting to see Red Dead Redemption 2 multiplayer.

2067
03:16:05,840 --> 03:16:10,989
And what exclusivity we got here exclusively.

2068
03:16:10,989 --> 03:16:15,950
Hey, if you, if you, if you bought this game day one and you supported rock star

2069
03:16:15,950 --> 03:16:18,750
and got in and played a bunch on the first day, you got rewarded.

2070
03:16:18,750 --> 03:16:20,750
When you get to play the beta, you get to play the beta early.

2071
03:16:22,319 --> 03:16:27,719
There it is.

2072
03:16:27,719 --> 03:16:28,440
Doesn't quite work.

2073
03:16:30,079 --> 03:16:32,479
And when it does, it's seems like a fucking lot of fun.

2074
03:16:33,530 --> 03:16:37,209
But the beta has just seemed like a gigantic network stress test,

2075
03:16:37,209 --> 03:16:37,930
which makes sense.

2076
03:16:37,930 --> 03:16:38,649
Okay, that's fine.

2077
03:16:39,709 --> 03:16:42,430
But not really, uh, not really completely playable yet.

2078
03:16:48,879 --> 03:16:50,399
And we can't even do it anymore.

2079
03:16:50,399 --> 03:16:59,389
Oh, well, fault.

2080
03:16:59,389 --> 03:17:02,030
There's a fault on rock star's game services.

2081
03:17:06,280 --> 03:17:15,629
Well, Peggle time.

2082
03:17:23,659 --> 03:17:24,059
Damn it.

2083
03:17:25,260 --> 03:17:27,899
If, okay, if the stream had been going for like five hours,

2084
03:17:27,899 --> 03:17:29,020
maybe like Peggle 2.

2085
03:17:29,020 --> 03:17:29,260
Okay.

2086
03:17:29,260 --> 03:17:30,780
That's funny for like 40 minutes.

2087
03:17:31,420 --> 03:17:40,430
Just played Red.

2088
03:17:40,430 --> 03:17:45,260
I, I, I'm sorry, guys.

2089
03:17:47,260 --> 03:17:49,260
It's kind of completely out of my hands at this point.

2090
03:17:49,899 --> 03:17:56,430
So, um, I mean, I could, here's, here's what's going to happen.

2091
03:17:56,430 --> 03:17:56,829
All right.

2092
03:17:56,829 --> 03:17:57,629
Let's be real.

2093
03:17:59,440 --> 03:18:03,360
Uh, I have to install Peggle 2 and it's going to take like six hours.

2094
03:18:05,420 --> 03:18:07,340
I'm going to move to Red Dead single player.

2095
03:18:07,979 --> 03:18:09,500
I still am like halfway through the game.

2096
03:18:11,149 --> 03:18:17,049
And then after like an hour or so, like another hour, two hours or something,

2097
03:18:17,049 --> 03:18:18,170
we'll try the multiplayer again.

2098
03:18:18,809 --> 03:18:27,280
We'll just do the, we'll just stay in Red Dead

2099
03:18:27,280 --> 03:18:28,479
because that's what I wanted to do.

2100
03:18:28,479 --> 03:18:29,520
I wanted to play Red Dead.

2101
03:18:30,399 --> 03:18:35,549
And it's, once we go off the rails and it's like, oh, Peggle and then Bloodborne.

2102
03:18:35,549 --> 03:18:39,069
And then, um, um, uh, what else do I have on PS4?

2103
03:18:40,110 --> 03:18:40,909
Flash games.

2104
03:18:40,909 --> 03:18:46,270
I'd rather just stay fairly, uh, fairly in the same, uh, same realm.
