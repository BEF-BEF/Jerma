00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:20,179
Okay, so what we're gonna do, you guys, we're gonna play a game called Simon Says. If you don't know how to play that, then you're just dead anyway. So are we ready? Everybody turn to me. The game's gonna start when you turn to me.

2
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:24,769
Now, Simon Says turn to me. Okay, Simon Says...

3
00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:26,940
Ow, hold on.

4
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,940
Kill him! Get that son of a bitch!

5
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,310
Oh, hold on. I gotta... hold on a second, guys.

6
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,549
Simon Says, we're gonna jump.

7
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:39,710
That guy on the left! Okay, he did, he did. He's good.

8
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,890
Simon Says, sing a wonderful song!

9
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:52,179
Uh, sorry. That wasn't fucking good enough!

10
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:59,149
Well, I thought that's what... that's what you... they didn't do what I wanted them to do, so I killed them.

11
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:01,149
That's how you're supposed to play.

12
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:06,040
What? What do I do?

13
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,280
What does that mean, rebel?

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,870
What? Oh, the...

15
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,689
Oh, whoops.

16
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:20,689
Is there a disco here? What the hell is that?

17
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:29,810
Can we... can we have a disco party after this? I wanna play disco. I know I've been bad, but still.

18
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:37,459
Is anybody going to answer me? I'm trying to ask a question.

19
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:45,799
I want Warden again. Give it to me. Give me Warden. I'm not listening to you.

20
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:52,219
I'm gonna do whatever the fuck I want, because I don't care. How about that one?

21
00:01:52,219 --> 00:02:01,879
What's a potato? What are you talking about? Are you talking to me?

22
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:05,120
What the fuck? He just killed me for no reason!

23
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:10,120
That guy first captured Shelby for no reason. I want him reported. I want him in jail.

24
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,120
Listen, everybody shut the... shut the fuck up, everybody.

25
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,120
Okay, so on the count of... I never told you to come down here.

26
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,360
Nobody said to come down here. You have five seconds to go back up the stairs.

27
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,360
Five, four, three, three, three. You made it, okay.

28
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,360
So everybody now on the... I want you all to come to the line and line up crouching.

29
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:38,689
If you are not crouching, then you are dead. That's all I gotta say, so get down here.

30
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:42,310
All my friends will shoot... Don't shoot him!

31
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:48,310
Okay, so when you line up... No, don't kill him. He just wanted to say hi and give you a hug.

32
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,430
Okay, so what we're gonna do here...

33
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:56,860
What we're gonna do is we're gonna have all these CTs please line up here with me.

34
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,860
Line up side by side with me.

35
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,860
Because you guys have been so good, you terrorists, will you cut to shit?

36
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,550
Quit shooting people in the face. What the hell, man?

37
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:11,729
Okay, what? Seriously? Seriously, I'm trying to talk here.

38
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:16,099
I want all the T's to come and give your favorite CT a hug.

39
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:18,099
Okay, let's do it. Everyone come give us a hug.

40
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:22,270
Yeah, I love hugs too. Yay, thank you for the hug.

41
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,270
That's a wonderful hug you're giving me.

42
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:31,159
What the fuck? You're supposed to hug people!

43
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:33,659
All right, so all the boys...

44
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:39,090
Thank you. I didn't mean to. It was not me.
