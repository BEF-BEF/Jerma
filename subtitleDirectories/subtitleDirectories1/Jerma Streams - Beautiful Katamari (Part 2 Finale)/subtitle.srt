1
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:22,899
Welcome to the stream. Hi everybody, welcome. It's me. I'm almost not late. I mean I'm not late.

2
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:31,379
How can you be almost not late? You are either late or you're not. So we're gonna finish

3
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:39,380
Katamari Beautiful after we finish the DLC. I think there's another one or two levels in the

4
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,299
base game and then there's I think six or seven DLC levels. We're gonna smoke them all.

5
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:55,530
I'm anticipating that will take somewhere between two and four hours. No, maybe it'll take a little

6
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,369
shorter. I don't know. Maybe it'll take longer. I don't know. Regardless how long this takes,

7
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:06,099
if there's still some time, which there probably will be. I don't- Bumbo came out. I didn't even

8
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:17,079
know that. The Legend of Bumbo released last week. I kind of been waiting for it. It's the

9
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:25,750
binding of Isaac prequel. It's a weird match three kind of card game. I don't know. Edmund

10
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:32,980
McMillan just makes crazy shit. So I want to try it. It's addictive as fuck. Well, that's good to

11
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:41,060
hear. So we started Katamari last night. I'm gonna finish it. We're doing this thing where I start

12
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:46,659
game, finish game, but there's still it's been like two and a half hours. So start new game.

13
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:57,530
The train just keeps moving, apparently. I also, I kind of, I don't know, I kind of like want to

14
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:02,730
play the Star Wars game. I just keep seeing people talk about it. I seen the lightsabers

15
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:14,090
and the dodge rolling and just like, I think I want to play that. He's a fake Star Wars fan.

16
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:23,289
I own more Star Wars clothes than anybody. I mean, does that mean I'm a big Star Wars fan?

17
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:32,060
Does it mean that I shop exclusively at Walmart? You're wearing an Aquaman shirt right now. I am

18
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:44,460
not. It's a decent game from what I hear. Yeah, and we never play brand new releases. Sometimes

19
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:52,900
we do. When a triple A game releases, you 99% of the time don't see it on this channel. So

20
00:02:53,860 --> 00:03:03,740
yeah, the ape game. Yeah. But that was, is that a triple A game? I don't think so. That's like

21
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:09,400
a double A game. You literally only play monkey related games when they release.

22
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:26,599
That's true. That is a true statement. But still, I'm talking non-ape related video games.

23
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:35,060
We'll see how it goes today into the next week here. But I don't know, I might play

24
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:41,819
Bumbo and get addicted and I never play anything else. But let's finish Katamari.

25
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,740
Beautiful Katamari. Already got it open and I'm already at the next level.

26
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:58,840
I have no plan. We're kind of in a mystery world here. Well, not right now. I'd love to say I'm

27
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,620
playing Katamari. This isn't Dead Rising. I beat Dead Rising. Yeah, Dead Rising 2.

28
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,060
One go. One save file. Well, I mean, I mean, no restarts is what I meant to say.

29
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:18,360
Yeah, I did that. Somebody's gonna pogchamp and go, are you fucking serious? Yeah, add it to the

30
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:25,100
fucking badge. All right, this is called Schloss Cosmos. Roll up a powerful things

31
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:34,100
to make a supergiant. This might be the last base game level to find out. Welcome to the icon of

32
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:41,220
the princedom Schloss Cosmos. A grand space for an epic race to roll a supergiant.

33
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:48,740
We want you to collect lots of powerful things. Sumo, Rikishi, wrestlers, elephants and bulldozers.

34
00:04:49,379 --> 00:05:01,959
The supergiant needs to have some stopping power. Anywho, let's go. I wonder what song we're gonna

35
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:09,930
get this time. I missed big bits. Big bits. Did they? Yeah, they did. File actor at Lichon

36
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:24,120
of the 5,000 bits. That's so much money over the last few months, man. Thanks for the 5,000 bits.

37
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,120
Just saying, Jeremy, the new Star Wars game is kind of like Star Wars Dark Souls. Best Star Wars

38
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:35,800
game in a long time. I know, I know, but I've heard, I've heard very mixed things about it.

39
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:42,439
I've heard it's a great game. I've heard it's too safe. I've heard it's too hard. I've, I,

40
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:59,160
it's, I kind of just want to see for myself. You ready? I'm gonna die to lightsaber wheel.

41
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:05,079
I gotta form my own opinion, asshole. Why'd you call me an asshole? Hold on, this thing has to

42
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:12,759
be 10,000. That's a huge, this is absolutely the last base game level. I have 20 minutes to roll

43
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:22,860
10,000. Holy shit. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I want to make my, I just said that I want to make

44
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:28,620
my own opinion on it. What is a review? What is like somebody telling you, you know what I mean?

45
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,939
Like, I'm gonna make my own opinion. That's what I just told you. We gotta plug the black hole.

46
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:42,120
We need this to be an unimaginable size and all cosmos is home free. Otherwise,

47
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:50,939
squishville. Wow, it's not easy being you, is it? All right, let's go. This thing has to be

48
00:06:50,939 --> 00:07:08,139
10,000 kilometers. Off to a terrible start. It's a pretty good song.

49
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:21,139
Uh, little cars. I'm already one beater, so. How the hell am I gonna do this? It seems too big.

50
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:38,259
Get all the chicken. Can I pick up people? You have 20 minutes. Yeah, that goes fast though.

51
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:43,399
I mean, anybody that's been on this stream, in Time Plaza and you're having fun, 20 minutes is

52
00:07:43,399 --> 00:08:03,060
like fucking two on this stream. We have just so much fun. See, it's already been, it's already

53
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:19,290
been three minutes and it's felt like 30. See? We have so much fun here. Let's get big enough

54
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:28,759
to get on the buildings. That's all I care about. I gotta get out of this, but three meters I can

55
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:38,220
go up. Bikes will do it. Yep. All right, let's go. I'm gonna go up this way. Wait, where was it?

56
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:49,820
This is the best game? I agree. This is a great game. All the Katamari games are awesome.

57
00:08:51,960 --> 00:09:04,330
What was the last? Is this the last Katamari game? Besides the reboot? No, what was the last one?

58
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:14,620
There's another one on the PS3. So did they just kind of, I mean, I guess once you do this enough

59
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,460
times, there's only so many times you can make this game where you're just like, yeah, we kind

60
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:26,809
of did it all, huh? I would love to see, I know it's, what else would they do? I would love to see

61
00:09:26,809 --> 00:09:32,090
another Katamari, like a current gen Katamari. I feel like you can make it bigger. The scope could

62
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:36,250
be larger because that's what happens in a game like this. It's like, well, what do we do? Do we

63
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,649
just keep the same game but just make it even bigger?

64
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:59,720
Pick them up? Yep. Let's go down the road. Katamari with guns and crafting. All right,

65
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:16,700
he's talking. Katamari with guns and crafting. What is it? It's 15 to get over the next hill,

66
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:26,519
right? I might just go up there now. He'll just do it now.

67
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:42,649
Oh, that looks like a lot of time, but there's a prince right there. Who's this? Is it a horse?

68
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:56,220
It's Kenta. Why aren't you eating your mash? What? All right, let's get the centipede. All right,

69
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:11,700
turn it around. This is it. All right. 10,000. I'm only 15 meters. How is this going to work?

70
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:27,750
We need bigger stuff. Run over the trees. Run over the tank. There we go. Tons of people.

71
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:48,679
Go. Get over to that car park. All right, and this whole city here. We've got everywhere.

72
00:11:48,679 --> 00:12:01,190
That's what I'm trying to get around. Everyone always says, dude, what if the earth and where

73
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:08,490
to end? We're going to get hit by an asteroid or something. That's boring. I wouldn't be much

74
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:39,379
prefer this. No. Why? Wait, you just want to get hit by an asteroid? What about don't get hit by

75
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:45,110
one? What about nothing? Yeah, I'm saying in the event that there's like a catastrophic space,

76
00:12:45,830 --> 00:13:04,179
like big bang type shit again. Yeah, if it had music, that's what I'm saying. If this music

77
00:13:04,179 --> 00:13:24,360
just blasted. I got 12 minutes almost. Music would have to be fine. All right, back to the other.

78
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:36,330
I get the big ones. I can't. Can I get the big building?

79
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:52,870
Thanks. Nope. Head back over here. Got to get to a hundred. Once you get to a hundred,

80
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:59,940
that's when you can just start steamrolling every single thing across.

81
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:21,669
Two, three, four. There it is. All right, scoop them up. 60. You got to be 60 feet.

82
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:36,549
Get it all. Take up the whole earth. What? I still can't get it. This is the last level. This is the

83
00:14:36,549 --> 00:14:44,039
last base game level. There are seven DLC levels. I'm going to try this. We're going to play.

84
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:18,700
I think it's island time. No, I need one more. Get the stadium.

85
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:41,289
Oh, another prince. Macho. I got him. Oh, it's right there. All right, go for the dinosaurs instead.

86
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:57,179
Present. Oh, what's the present? Yep, island time. Let's go. I got a lot of time.

87
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:10,840
Let's go get all the monsters. One more growth increase and I should be able to pick up the

88
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:33,000
actual island. Funny time. That's right. You get it. Bastard. Stadium. 300 to get the next increase.

89
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:48,309
Oh, shit. All right, back to the turn around. This way. Jumped everything I wanted. Just pick up.

90
00:16:48,309 --> 00:17:08,009
Damn it. Give me the bird. Oh, too small. All right, 300. Time to start moving. I can actually

91
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:32,730
pick up the ground now. Momentum. Too much momentum. Too much momentum. This way. I don't even

92
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:38,140
know what I just picked up. There's a whole other island over there I haven't even been to. This is

93
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:49,539
going to get you a lot. Please don't tell me to pick it all up. Some of it. 500. I need to get to

94
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:57,289
10,000. Not 10. I need to get to 10,000 kilometers. I'm not sure I'm saying that right.

95
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:21,059
Pick up all the pink. I'm stuck. Holy shit. Look at that giant octopus. All right, this way.

96
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:37,400
Look at all these mushrooms. Forward. Pick it up. Look at these penguins. Pick it up. A whole fat

97
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:46,490
penguin. What am I picking up? I think I got a present. All right, yeah, I got a present.

98
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:57,819
All right, I can't. I don't want to lose this, please. Okay. This is going to get insane. This

99
00:18:57,819 --> 00:19:05,779
is so satisfying. What I just did right there was the equivalent of watching like 10 self-cutting

100
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:18,569
videos in a row. I feel great. Fuck. All right, forget it. Just go. I have to move. Turn. Turn.

101
00:19:18,569 --> 00:19:39,059
It won't turn. I'm trying. It's too big. I don't even know what to say. There's too many islands.

102
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:57,910
Is this what it looks like from space? Imagine this is what it actually looked like out of

103
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:07,589
the window from the space station. Would you guys, like, if you were an astronaut,

104
00:20:07,589 --> 00:20:17,720
would you talk about this? Would you want to take a picture of this? I feel like the worlds

105
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:33,880
is better off not known. I don't even know if I'm picking anything up. Get the whole city.

106
00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:54,789
Yeah. 10,000. Where the fuck am I going to do that? Can't get the volcano. I don't think I can get

107
00:20:54,789 --> 00:21:16,200
the octopus either. Nope. Not yet. What is even left to pick up? Did I get him? I got him.

108
00:21:29,369 --> 00:21:58,549
Only two. Get the dragon. Got you. Holy shit. Uh, this is earth. Oh, 400.

109
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:34,099
Well, this started to really, really pick up. I need to get to 10,000. Hurry. Cousin. Got him.

110
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:51,539
It's Mag. Uh, I don't know if I'm going to do it. It's going to be close. Really close.

111
00:22:52,259 --> 00:23:11,190
I can't pick up the land. I'm trying to get it. Let's get all of Antarctica.

112
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:31,940
Come on. I can't get. What is that? USA? I need more land mass. There we go. Right here.

113
00:23:40,140 --> 00:24:25,609
Get it all. Quick. 5,000. One minute. Come on. I'm not even close. No. 6,000. Get it all. No.

114
00:24:25,609 --> 00:24:45,980
It's going to be so close. Australia. I got it. What's left? This way. What's left? 9,000. I did

115
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:59,369
it. We're finally in space. Somewhere out here is the yucky black hole. I have to plug the black

116
00:24:59,369 --> 00:25:08,329
hole. I don't think I won. How about a two minute bonus to level the field? I got nice. I got this

117
00:25:08,329 --> 00:25:19,029
perfect. Okay. Don't go near. Don't go near the black hole. It'll suck you in. Wait until the

118
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:33,980
Katamari is big enough to plug it. Where's the black hole? Oh my god. I'm getting all the planet.

119
00:25:34,779 --> 00:25:49,180
Pisces. Orion. There's the sun. I can't get the sun yet. What? What? What? What? Danger. Danger.

120
00:25:49,180 --> 00:26:05,369
Danger. Get away from there. I can't see it. You're near the black hole. Run or it'll squish you.

121
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:18,779
Where is it? Shoo from the black hole. I can't see it. Wait, is that? That's him. Oh, there it is.

122
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:36,140
I see it. Okay. Turn around. Give me that planet. Approaching black hole. Approaching black hole.

123
00:26:36,859 --> 00:26:55,779
I'm not big enough. What do I have to be? 500,000? Something hyper. It's ace. Oh shit.

124
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:23,319
I only got 30 seconds. Am I big enough? How big do I have to be? 10 seconds. I gotta be a million.

125
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:33,829
Oh fuck. I'm not gonna do it. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. All right. Very nice. This Katamari

126
00:27:33,829 --> 00:27:42,980
looks kind of big. But why is it here? We did say it's to plug up the black hole. Then why is it

127
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:51,940
still here? You want to take it home? Oh, go on then. But wait. What about the black hole? It needs

128
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:58,180
to be plugged up. Why don't you listen to us? You don't want to help? We have nothing to say.

129
00:27:58,339 --> 00:28:07,799
Too bad, bad. Sorry. Shame. Resignation. Wrath. Con. Put that silly ball down and come over here.

130
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:30,099
God damn it. Shit. That's a lot. That's sad. I need to get to a million. Okay. I'm gonna go quick now.

131
00:28:30,819 --> 00:28:43,769
It's all right. It's all right. We can still do it. Omega lull. 20 plus minutes. It was fun though.

132
00:28:43,769 --> 00:28:55,960
I'm just gonna be faster. Okay. I get two extra minutes. Here we go. That was a warm-up run. Bad

133
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:32,869
RNG. Bad spot. Bad spot. This is bad RNG. Sorry. I'll make it work. Can't get people yet.

134
00:29:36,630 --> 00:30:04,140
Bad RNG. Bad RNG. It's okay. I gotta get to three. Better not. Why is this whole town on fire?

135
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:17,740
Second I get to three, we're turning that corner. This might be salvageable if I get over there

136
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:39,880
quick. Damn it. Come on. I'm almost there. That's a shit start. That's kind of a shit start for me.

137
00:30:41,819 --> 00:30:44,700
I gotta make this up very quick. I have to make this up now.

138
00:30:59,339 --> 00:31:34,869
Still possible. Oh, it's a shit start. Should I restart? Hmm. Oh. If I can get to the next

139
00:31:34,869 --> 00:31:41,140
phase really quickly, then I don't have to restart it. Add elephant fucking RNG to me.

140
00:31:53,559 --> 00:32:54,150
That's a lot of time that I just made up. Down here? Decent. Okay. Decent. All right. Come back.

141
00:32:54,150 --> 00:33:00,599
Don't, don't lollygag. I'm not, although I, I do, I will admit I did look over at the copypasta

142
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:26,680
and I read it. That was my mistake. House is looking good. It's key forward momentum.

143
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:50,490
This is the one I want to be in. Right here. Don't hit the plane. Don't hit the plane.

144
00:33:54,970 --> 00:34:19,909
All right. Next town. Next town. Next town. Next town. Back up here. Stop the pasta. There's no way.

145
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:29,739
I can't. Why do you expect me to do that? Everyone says don't put it on slow mode.

146
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:47,800
But why is R9K on? You got your answer. It's in front of you. 12 minutes. Is this enough time?

147
00:34:48,760 --> 00:35:19,480
Blow it. I blow it. That's a reset right there. I blow it. Do a jump. How's my pace from last time?

148
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:35,909
Worse? Is it worse? I can't tell.

149
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:07,500
Chat is worse than ever. Fuck. All right. Just wait a minute. Give me a minute. I'll figure it out.

150
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:29,300
Just hold on. I need to get those clouds. Stop interrupting me. Ping. Let's get out into the

151
00:36:29,300 --> 00:37:04,099
ocean now. Get the whole Antarctic. I can get most of this shit right now. Go. Go, go, go, go, go.

152
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:17,460
This way. This way. This way. Fast. That was a good line. This is fucking Tony Hawk level.

153
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:58,340
That's like a million points. Spin. Good. That was pretty damn good. Oh no. I didn't want to

154
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:09,269
go over that. Wasting time. I mean it was really cool, but what a waste of time that was.

155
00:38:13,099 --> 00:38:34,570
Go forward. Forward. Forward. Hold it. You have to relax. No, there's no relaxing. All right.

156
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:47,179
I'm going for the rainy city over there. All right. Almost at the point where I'm going to

157
00:38:47,179 --> 00:38:53,420
get like five times my size. Let's get this entire island. Don't leave it. Get it all.

158
00:38:54,780 --> 00:39:16,579
Got some present. The line going. I'm going to go forward. Right to the volcano.

159
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:31,800
Can I get the volcano? Remember, I get two. Flip around. I get two extra minutes.

160
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:58,739
No. Can't get the volcano. Still can't get the. No, I got. Go faster. I'm trying. I need to get

161
00:39:58,739 --> 00:40:17,769
up like four. It's gonna happen. Three. All right. This is where it starts. Hurry up. It's all about

162
00:40:17,769 --> 00:40:48,420
the clouds here and the right here. Pick up all the sand. Because it said it couldn't be done.

163
00:40:49,380 --> 00:41:01,639
It might not be done. I still have to do it. Trying to pick up as big the island as I can.

164
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:11,909
All right. I know. I know. I got somebody. Good. Good to know. Bigger. Bigger. Bigger. Bigger.

165
00:41:11,909 --> 00:41:23,179
Bigger. All right. Can I pick up all the sand? I think so. I'm gonna get this and I'm gonna spin

166
00:41:23,179 --> 00:41:45,110
around. Come on. I don't want to do it again. It's 20 plus minutes. All right, I got. That

167
00:41:45,110 --> 00:42:09,809
that was Europe right good I think I can pick this up nope go fast

168
00:42:09,809 --> 00:42:41,630

169
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:55,380
extra two or three minutes than I did last time that was so much faster I got

170
00:42:55,380 --> 00:43:05,769
six minutes instead of two do not go into the black hole two minute bonus

171
00:43:05,769 --> 00:43:17,179
don't go to the black hole don't get sucked in I got about six minutes let's

playthrough of the game where the person doesn't talk I'm gonna go so slow it's

190
00:47:47,630 --> 00:48:03,019

00:48:03,659 --> 00:48:20,039
here shit I can't get it actually hitting that trees enough in the trees

192
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:25,079

337
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:59,420
like you see doctor I I lied to my live stream about eating ghost pepper and then

338
01:31:59,420 --> 01:32:02,859
I got I was brushing in the evening because I told everybody I was gonna eat

339
01:32:02,859 --> 01:32:08,619
it because I was malting during catamari the final level I got sucked into the

340
01:32:08,619 --> 01:32:12,619
black hole and then he's gonna drop his fucking data sheet right he's gonna be

341
01:32:12,619 --> 01:32:18,479
like fuck that level I'm gonna be like we talking about fuck that level he's

342
01:32:18,479 --> 01:32:23,960
gonna be like yeah I remember that level I mean what is with the developers

344
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:34,520
I'm gonna be like what I thought what is that I remember that level and it took

345
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:47,300
me like 10 tries oh by the way because you ate the ghost pepper you're dead in

346
01:32:47,340 --> 01:33:00,949
three days oh and then he's gonna walk out of the room and under his lab coat

347
01:33:00,949 --> 01:33:06,079
I'm gonna see he's gonna have molting skin like this gonna be like a big cape

348
01:33:06,079 --> 01:33:10,000
of vaulted skin like he's already done this shit he did it like two weeks ago

539
02:12:28,100 --> 02:12:34,560
thing like that it's all a blur too much soju we think for some reason it's been

540
02:12:34,560 --> 02:12:40,260
like this all week the pasta pandemonium the sushi shin did and now our very own

541

obesity crisis the weight can't stay no like guess they must go this is the

542
02:12:45,779 --> 02:12:51,659
reason we ourselves are on a roll but warm things will help us sweat out the

543
02:12:51,659 --> 02:12:58,939

deep flavor that it with the fries and the crispiness and you may as well just

611

and dig out cat shit and put it on my food same reaction I need luxury lily

620
02:27:34,040 --> 02:27:44,459
pads aren't luxurious and we need animals now Earth has lots of living

621
02:27:44,459 --> 02:27:49,159
things not as many as it used to which makes us sad here's an idea you can roll

622
02:27:49,159 --> 02:27:54,559
up creatures everyone needs to pick me up now and then yes do you have any

623
02:27:54,559 --> 02:28:03,709
favorite friends English style small ones slow ones snails mouse lemurs we

624
02:28:03,750 --> 02:28:11,270
prefer the Giants whenever we're on earth we visit with whales we swim and

625
02:28:11,270 --> 02:28:17,190
jump and feast by the light of the start there are old friends and we can't find

626
02:28:17,190 --> 02:28:22,709
though did we all offend them that would be just often we have big friends on

627
02:28:22,709 --> 02:28:29,540
other stars too we got big friends big enough to wrestle like the fish and

628
02:28:30,100 --> 02:28:37,850
this is a Trump spawned in a grease trap fire fast-food store we confess he's the

629
02:28:37,850 --> 02:28:41,569
only creature that scares us just a little though and only when he's eating

630
02:28:41,569 --> 02:28:46,049
anyway we want you to gather lots of creatures friends from all walks of

631
02:28:46,049 --> 02:28:50,450
hops and slithers of life we think of Katamari maybe the ideal ecosystem I

632
02:28:50,450 --> 02:29:02,149
just saw Tabasco sauce on an s-tier convent list yep you did all right

633
02:29:02,149 --> 02:29:18,579
animals there we go on the tier list I think I already did it people animals

634
02:29:18,579 --> 02:29:24,659

of all the cosmos does giving up power make you more powerful thinking face do

656
02:33:27,409 --> 02:33:41,139
deep end of the pool let's just stick to rolling up powerful stuff what's a

661
02:34:39,670 --> 02:34:47,690
never been there for more than a couple days yes I've driven down the driven

662
02:34:47,690 --> 02:34:52,329
I've driven through New Jersey and I've spent maybe like a two hours there

663
02:34:52,329 --> 02:35:17,159
from a pump to Brazil 12 hours is enough but that's okay here's the thing a lot

664
02:35:17,159 --> 02:35:22,360
of people don't realize especially if you're not American if you are a non

665
02:35:22,360 --> 02:35:24,879
American watching right now you're probably like wait how the fuck you live

666
02:35:24,879 --> 02:35:30,879
in the United States have you never been to some of these places and because why

667
02:35:30,879 --> 02:35:36,350
I don't have a reason is they may as well be other countries look I know you

668
02:35:36,350 --> 02:35:42,719
can go from like France to Denmark in like seven hours in a fucking train it's

669
02:35:42,719 --> 02:35:56,399
a it's USA is huge and it may as well be like eight different countries from the

670
02:35:56,399 --> 02:36:00,549
climate from the different climates that are in America to the different

671
02:36:00,549 --> 02:36:09,469
types of people that are the different cultures it's a huge place and I know I

672
02:36:09,469 --> 02:36:31,870
know I do my prize English style but I'm an American but yeah people I was all

673
02:36:31,870 --> 02:36:39,399
right let me tell you something the difference between Nevada and Alabama it

674
02:36:39,399 --> 02:36:53,100
we may as well be on other planets one of them is like the desert and the other

675
02:36:53,100 --> 02:37:03,520
one is like a swamp the United States is just Dark Souls it's just a Dark Souls

676
02:37:03,520 --> 02:37:23,920
map it's a video game region it's Warcraft zones I got a little ocean

677
02:37:23,920 --> 02:37:42,829
stuff yep yep VR Josh I have not paid it I have not even been looking at the

678
02:37:42,829 --> 02:37:48,270
screen I've been reading chat at least 10 to 12 straight minutes I've just been

679
02:37:48,270 --> 02:38:08,920
moving these sticks long as this level that's a great question long enough to

680
02:38:08,920 --> 02:38:14,680
hopefully not fail it's my opinion on ketchup

681
02:38:27,700 --> 02:38:34,059
ketchup and mayonnaise well you just made a dressing ketchup and mayonnaise is

682
02:38:34,059 --> 02:38:59,159
the thing already thousand islands now you got my attention I can't really eat

683
02:38:59,159 --> 02:39:07,120
it anymore but I was a fiend for Tabasco and ketchup

684
02:39:07,120 --> 02:39:16,149
you would do ketchup and a little thing a little cup the cup with the that's is not

685
02:39:16,149 --> 02:39:20,190
that's all you need and then stir it up with a french fry

686
02:39:20,190 --> 02:39:36,379
that's so that's the blue you do like two or three bloop bloops and that's all

687
02:39:36,379 --> 02:39:49,719
you need you don't need anything else more energy more energy and that's what

688
02:39:49,719 --> 02:40:01,239
I'm doing when is it eating the ghost pepper I already did man oh it's good

689
02:40:01,239 --> 02:40:28,569
burn socks tears tears tears are coming down tears are coming down

690
02:40:36,239 --> 02:40:54,250
we've got you're grasping them never been aggressive to stop you before

691
02:40:54,250 --> 02:41:07,569
all right we're hopefully nearly full grown we've managed to put on some size

692
02:41:07,569 --> 02:41:13,559
haven't we we find the sound of our own voices soothing we sort of lose track of

693
02:41:13,559 --> 02:41:18,659
everything else but we're quite content with the job you've done you're free to

694
02:41:18,659 --> 02:41:23,579
roll up whatever you like we'll nap if you'd like to stop just hit the X button

what about the DLC levels they're gonna be the DLC levels are gonna be just not

696
02:41:58,059 --> 02:42:16,459
even interesting if I roll up every single thing in the game I got some roll

697
02:42:16,459 --> 02:42:23,329
up the key here he is rolled up he's in there the DLC levels are more themed

698
02:42:23,329 --> 02:42:34,370
now I'm getting flashbacks I don't want to be going with the big

699
02:42:34,370 --> 02:42:50,530
posthumous thing again I beat it let's do these themes levels just get it over

02:43:55,069 --> 02:44:16,659
Jerma Pepper let me see this is the same thing oh a horse I can have the king head on that's cool

705
02:44:16,659 --> 02:44:26,899
and that's I've never taken giraffe off I've ever had old bay yeah I have old

706
02:44:26,899 --> 02:44:31,639
bay's all right it's good on a lot of stuff but I wouldn't just put it on

707
02:44:31,639 --> 02:44:45,520
anything do I like my steak with a one the back when I was like 14 I would put

708
02:44:45,520 --> 02:44:51,450
A1 on the steak because I thought it made me more of an adult I thought

709
02:44:51,450 --> 02:44:57,700
ordering A1 made me look older and look like I knew what I was talking about at

710
02:44:57,700 --> 02:45:05,079
restaurants also another funny thing I used to lie to my dentist all the time

711
02:45:05,079 --> 02:45:10,329
for no reason when I was like 13 I would tell them I don't know my brother used

712
02:45:10,329 --> 02:45:15,129
to laugh his ass off at this he still brings it up sometimes when I would be

713
02:45:15,129 --> 02:45:19,850
in the chair and we'll be talking about how things are going yeah I get any

714
02:45:19,850 --> 02:45:23,010
concerns anything going on yeah you're brushing twice a day yeah you're

715
02:45:23,010 --> 02:45:29,010
flossing oh yeah I'm flossing and I've been chewing a lot of Trident too like

716
02:45:29,010 --> 02:45:32,690
I've been chewing Trident gum cuz that was the one that was supposed to clean

717
02:45:32,690 --> 02:45:40,879
your mouth from all the commercials and the dentist would always be like oh okay

718
02:45:40,879 --> 02:45:53,979
that's that and that is a straight-up lie right it is they used to have

section again no don't get stuck don't get stuck six hundred down nice

822
03:07:17,299 --> 03:07:27,979
I've ever swallowed gum on purpose no it gives me anxiety because I was told that

823
03:07:27,979 --> 03:07:32,299
it takes nine years to have gum go through your whole digestive system so

824
03:07:32,299 --> 03:07:54,549
it made me scared forever only seven years how would a rumor like that even

825
03:07:54,549 --> 03:08:02,239
start to scare you it was done no I know it's parents trying to scare their kids

826
03:08:02,239 --> 03:08:07,120
so they because kids oh this is yummy delicious tastes like fruits no but they

827
03:08:07,120 --> 03:08:10,479
don't you're not supposed to swallow it down so what if we just tell make up this

828
03:08:10,479 --> 03:08:16,479
huge lie about if you swallow it you're fucked for ten years don't swallow that

829
03:08:16,479 --> 03:08:25,219
gum little Timmy it's gonna stay in you for seven years it terrifies you I get

830
03:08:25,219 --> 03:08:34,790
it it's kind of funny because I'm pretty sure if bagel and cream cheese takes

831
03:08:34,790 --> 03:08:38,510
longer to go through your body than gum if you were to swallow it takes like

832
03:08:38,510 --> 03:08:57,110
four days

833
03:09:01,729 --> 03:09:11,750
that was barely worth it what kind of bagels do I like I like everything

834
03:09:11,750 --> 03:09:32,799
bagels or onion I will tell you I'm not a sugary bagel kind of guy cinnamon

836
03:09:47,469 --> 03:09:58,520
lovers Lou roll up fabric to make a big up salmon bagel yes salmon I like it I

837
03:09:58,520 --> 03:10:04,659
have to be in the mood for smoked salmon on a bagel though that's not

838
03:10:04,659 --> 03:10:14,260
something that I want every day but I do like it yeah smoke salmon cream cheese

839
03:10:14,260 --> 03:10:19,979
it's great you got to really be in the mood for it though it's kind of heavy

840
03:10:19,979 --> 03:10:40,020
red yes yarn to string even bagels have more sugar than a candy bar yeah white

841
03:10:40,020 --> 03:10:47,879
isn't white bread the equivalent of eating cotton candy like in your body

842
03:10:47,879 --> 03:10:58,399
this process the same way it's worse is it I've heard I'm telling what I've

843
03:10:58,879 --> 03:11:12,680
cream cheese capers that's the only place where I think I would ever have

844
03:11:12,680 --> 03:11:25,520
actual want capers is on locks and bagels that's only in America you guys

845
03:11:25,520 --> 03:11:33,639
are strange and put sugar in everything I'm not into that wait special rule for

846
03:11:33,639 --> 03:11:38,360
the day make a big ball of yarn and string look at I love this level already

847
03:11:38,360 --> 03:11:47,569
this is makes me want to play Zuma let's say this big in three minutes one meter

848
03:11:47,569 --> 03:11:58,040
that's not very much time okay yarn cloth string be crafty and spin a ball

849
03:11:58,040 --> 03:12:06,899
of many colors all right let's try it

850
03:12:06,899 --> 03:12:28,379
what the hell can I even pick up here I need to pick up something okay can I get these I need to get bigger but this one's going to be

851
03:12:28,379 --> 03:12:40,530
satisfying check this any more colors than red no I don't like it we've gone

852
03:12:40,569 --> 03:12:45,610
over this before on screen but just the people that have never been here you're

853
03:12:45,610 --> 03:12:53,250
only supposed to take in I think men are supposed to take in 38 grams of added

854
03:12:53,250 --> 03:13:01,489
sugar a day and I think I think women are supposed it's like 32 or 34 but one

855
03:13:01,489 --> 03:13:07,860
can of coke is your whole daily allowed limit for added sugar that's I kind of

856
03:13:07,860 --> 03:13:25,510
fucked up three cokes a day dad dude I used to pound code red I would drink

857
03:13:25,510 --> 03:13:36,799
code red every day I got it back downstairs I love this level this stuff

858
03:13:36,799 --> 03:13:46,809
is awesome I might replay this level just to feel good the sugar is everywhere

859
03:13:46,809 --> 03:13:54,329
only take it in 37 38 grams of sugar a day added like damn that's hard to do

860
03:13:54,370 --> 03:14:10,920
it's in everything and then you see well I just do sugar-free that shit's bad for

861
03:14:10,920 --> 03:14:18,750
you too

862
03:14:33,510 --> 03:14:39,239
one minute 30 seconds

863
03:14:46,360 --> 03:15:17,229
that means you have an iron that's all right I got to think what can you eat

864
03:15:17,229 --> 03:15:25,520
with iron in it spinach most meats liver if you I don't like chicken liver

865
03:15:25,520 --> 03:15:28,680
but chicken liver is the one of the highest places you can get actual good

866
03:15:28,680 --> 03:15:34,479
real iron I just I think it's gross so I can't do it but you can get from

867
03:15:34,479 --> 03:15:47,799
spinach spinach iron content is not great that's a lie well it's one of the

868
03:15:47,799 --> 03:15:51,639
plant-based ways you get it's not the same kind of iron you get from me and I

constellations like cancer a Leo and Pegasus you can find crabs lions and

901
03:20:51,479 --> 03:21:01,250
winged horsies that's the equivalent of biting a red pepper not liking the heat

03:26:21,239 --> 03:26:31,850
its burgers contain horse meat Taco Bell sent this statement to stress that the

935
03:26:31,850 --> 03:26:35,370
finding would not affect its US businesses our domestic restaurants

936
03:26:35,370 --> 03:26:39,489
have not been and will not be impacted because we do not use any meat from

937
03:26:39,489 --> 03:26:45,120
Europe we stand for quality and we use a hundred percent premium beef like all

938
03:26:45,120 --> 03:26:50,399
beef in the United States ours is USDA inspected and then passes our own 20

quality checkpoints all right good to know Taco Bell 88% meat look at this is

940
03:27:08,780 --> 03:27:15,979
just like how like fucking bullshit fake articles hold on so this is the headline

941
03:27:15,979 --> 03:27:26,909
Taco Bell says their meat is 88% beef not 36% 30 well how would it spread that

942
03:27:26,909 --> 03:27:48,469

1063
04:00:50,959 --> 04:01:00,180
what the fuck do you think it is um an emote that replaces the letter o

1067
04:02:08,719 --> 04:02:30,100
because that's what they are we eat them already we do I think that's it is there any more

1068
04:02:31,059 --> 04:02:34,309
I think there's one more dlc level it's one of the pods

1069

did I get them all I do this one that's the dangerous thing I just did

1070
04:02:48,559 --> 04:02:59,719
I feel like there was another pod up here this one that's the constellations

1071
04:03:01,479 --> 04:03:17,270
yeah did that did that did that up here did I do this pod mechanical yeah I did game over but

04:05:41,670 --> 04:05:49,860

1083
04:06:30,239 --> 04:06:45,780
tier list I wonder how it differs from when I did it already I did I what if it's all completely

1084
04:06:45,780 --> 04:07:09,680
different one more just normal Joel's movie no I'm not gonna watch Joel's movie I'm not gonna watch

1085
04:07:09,680 --> 04:07:16,639
a movie no I will some other day that's 30 minutes I don't get that kind of time

1086
04:07:25,139 --> 04:07:38,209
don't distract me from my favorite level you've already distracted me from my favorite level

1087
04:07:39,590 --> 04:07:47,430
and for this I I could not forgive you I've been distracted let's do it again you spent

1088
04:07:48,549 --> 04:08:08,879
two hours on one level I don't have time no we're gonna do a video watching stream anyways pretty

1089
04:08:08,879 --> 04:08:25,459
soon I'm not doing it tomorrow no I want to watch I want to watch like a movie on Twitch I

1090
04:08:25,459 --> 04:08:30,579
want to watch like a public domain movie and I guarantee you're gonna get sick of that real quick

1091
04:08:30,579 --> 04:08:41,590
so we can watch that movie there oh also while there's people here let's talk about this um

1092
04:08:41,590 --> 04:08:47,350
remember if you were in this pre-stream chat no you if you were in the post-stream chat I talked

1093
04:08:47,350 --> 04:08:54,149
we talked about this extensively yesterday we talked about stream that's gonna happen at some

1094
04:08:54,149 --> 04:09:03,799
point we've thrown ideas around of salt and germa where I get servers over the course of

1095
04:09:03,799 --> 04:09:10,739
a few different games and it's you I'm going to try to have as many people as humanly possible

1096
04:09:10,739 --> 04:09:15,860
in these servers let's say for instance a Minecraft server or a Conan exile server

1097
04:09:17,379 --> 04:09:25,540
and the whole goal is I'm the king and you have to do everything for me and if I die

1098
04:09:26,959 --> 04:09:39,670
the stream ends there are at least three or four games that I want to do this with

1099
04:09:42,180 --> 04:09:47,059
I'm gonna and what not just that that's just one piece of this I also want to set up like a king's

1100
04:09:47,059 --> 04:09:53,059
court where people come and like share their grievances with the king like we'll make like

1101
04:09:53,059 --> 04:09:57,379
a castle and shit and they'll I'll have like king's guard and you can come ask questions and

1102
04:09:58,180 --> 04:10:08,520
there'll be executions and shit I'm not gonna die in four seconds because I'm gonna have a

1103
04:10:08,520 --> 04:10:14,370
loyal king's guard there's gonna be like 20 people whose only job is to make sure that they're like

1104
04:10:14,370 --> 04:10:33,940
in like the gold armor to make it so I don't die me and uh me and cad were actually talking

1105
04:10:33,940 --> 04:10:41,889
about random stuff and like imagine a scenario where we play Minecraft and it's like bring me

1106
04:10:41,889 --> 04:10:56,530
50 gold bar gold boxes and make a statue of me or I execute five people I was like holy shit that's

1107
04:10:56,530 --> 04:11:13,280
fucking funny and now imagine there's 500 people in that server I want to collect taxes I want to

1108
04:11:13,280 --> 04:11:18,559
go door to door with my like king's guard and collect taxes and shit and if you try to kill me

1109
04:11:18,559 --> 04:11:25,250
or you better you better make it for real you better conspire with I'm coming to collect taxes

1110
04:11:28,000 --> 04:11:32,709
you fuck up an assassination attempt you're getting fed to the lions which is like a 12

1111
04:11:32,709 --> 04:11:53,280
foot dug hole with like aggressive wolves in it no lions are them lions in Minecraft I did it cool

1112
04:11:53,280 --> 04:11:59,399
that's fun but not just something like Minecraft but going to like here's the thing though like

1113
04:11:59,399 --> 04:12:03,639
Conan exiles I think you can only have like 50 people in a server why don't just get disconnected

1114
04:12:04,520 --> 04:12:11,860
so it would have to be we would have to whitelist people and maybe you'd have to like put an

1115
04:12:11,860 --> 04:12:16,979
application in as to why you should be in the town and I also want to set up a thing where if

1116
04:12:16,979 --> 04:12:21,459
we have a scenario like that oh you can only have 50 people in that server people are just

1117
04:12:21,459 --> 04:12:25,059
going to sit there and they're going to turtle they're not going to they're just going to you're

1118
04:12:25,059 --> 04:12:29,219
the same person's going to be there for like the whole other entire like three or four street by

1119
04:12:29,219 --> 04:12:40,239
the way uh the idea is that if I'm alive we keep going and the town progresses but um they'll be

1120
04:12:40,239 --> 04:12:47,920
aged so it'll be like one minute is like five to ten days and if you get to be like 60 years old

1121
04:12:47,920 --> 04:13:02,500
you die of old age so there's no you know we we're always cycling through people does the king age

1122
04:13:03,299 --> 04:13:08,389
yep but I'll age a little slower so I might just die of old age one day on stream

1123
04:13:15,239 --> 04:13:21,489
I just die of old age you gotta I'm gonna be a good king though what game am I thinking about

1124
04:13:21,489 --> 04:13:29,219
doing this in uh Minecraft is probably the easiest one to do it in there's also rust

1125
04:13:30,100 --> 04:13:35,379
there's also cone and exiles there's arc I'm thinking of any one of those games that came

1126
04:13:35,379 --> 04:13:40,020
out where it was just an open environment where you're supposed to build a castle

1127
04:13:40,020 --> 04:13:50,159
or build a thing with a bunch of people on the same server reign of kings there's a lot of them

1128
04:13:50,159 --> 04:14:01,250
and we could it could I want to make it a series but from game to game and scenario to scenario

1129
04:14:01,250 --> 04:14:08,370
for instance we talked about like I don't do anything it was going to be wow classic where

1130
04:14:08,850 --> 04:14:13,809
I was not going to play the game and if I had to exert any force then I would turn the stream off

1131
04:14:14,690 --> 04:14:22,680
that was the joke we were talking about last night and I was like if people want to actually

1132
04:14:22,680 --> 04:14:32,180
watch me do that shit we still could do that I don't know but imagine a scenario where there's

1133
04:14:32,180 --> 04:14:38,020
like a bunch of tunnels that I can like escape in in Minecraft somebody like if there's like

1134
04:14:38,020 --> 04:14:42,020
an angry mob outside coming in with bows and arrows it's like 30 of you that have all like

1135
04:14:42,020 --> 04:14:45,860
conspired that you're ready to go today's the day you're gonna go for the king oh better make

1136
04:14:45,860 --> 04:15:02,389
it there's 15 tunnels I'm gonna go through good luck I want to be like a living ecosystem for at

1137
04:15:02,389 --> 04:15:12,040
least a few days I don't know I might die instantly but I think it's worth doing I want to put like a

1138
04:15:12,040 --> 04:15:22,520
bunch of like time and resources into it I feel like it'd be really funny and really fun someone's

1139
04:15:22,520 --> 04:15:36,819
gonna shoot you in the head with an enchanted bow not if not if I look you gotta start from zero

1140
04:15:37,459 --> 04:15:43,360
it's gonna I'm gonna it's gonna be not easy I'm gonna I'm gonna mod those servers it's gonna be

1141
04:15:43,360 --> 04:16:02,319
you're gonna have age they'll be on your team we'll see your bodyguards will just be shields

1142
04:16:02,319 --> 04:16:08,879
well the theory is that to make it so I don't die in the first 10 seconds there's a you know town

1143
04:16:08,879 --> 04:16:14,879
hall and there's a castle and I have a room in the castle and all my loyal servants have rooms in

1144
04:16:14,879 --> 04:16:19,680
the castle and there's like 25 people in that castle that I gotta ring the bell if somebody's

1145
04:16:19,680 --> 04:16:30,840
climbing in my window with a fucking axe and I could defend myself too by the way if you die

1146
04:16:32,690 --> 04:16:51,959
that you're that's it you're out someone else is gonna take your place as a baby we'll just swarm

1147
04:16:52,840 --> 04:17:00,399
but will you though this is where it gets interesting because I'm not going to be like

1148
04:17:00,399 --> 04:17:08,020
a bad king I you know I'm just gonna I want the town to be sufficient and be moving forward and

1149
04:17:09,190 --> 04:17:14,079
there's gonna be lots of loyal people that are in this town well you think that they're just

1150
04:17:14,079 --> 04:17:21,620
gonna try to kill me we're gonna have trials there'll be trials by combat if you do something

1151
04:17:21,620 --> 04:17:26,930
wrong it's like if you if you get like arrested or if you try to kill me or something and I'm

1152
04:17:26,930 --> 04:17:32,530
feeling a little generous today the two people that tried to kill me that were working together

1153
04:17:32,530 --> 04:17:36,290
in their own little private discord you two have to fight to the death and whoever dies see you

1154
04:17:36,290 --> 04:17:57,649
later is the server gonna be hardcore probably not sure yet but I want to do this a few times over

1155
04:17:57,649 --> 04:18:04,870
a couple different games so this is all very preliminary but it's doing it for me and you

1156
04:18:04,870 --> 04:18:09,680
know one of the one is an idea that does it for me it's it happens it's just gonna happen

1157
04:18:10,399 --> 04:18:14,319
I'm gonna put a bunch of time and I'm gonna put some money into it too see if we can get

1158
04:18:14,319 --> 04:18:19,520
some like coded server shit that you know you can have aging in the servers and you just get

1159
04:18:19,520 --> 04:18:28,610
deleted and you die it should be fun but there are a couple different ways to play it we can

1160
04:18:28,610 --> 04:18:39,680
do them as many ways as we want what game that hasn't been decided yet it'll be probably like

1161
04:18:39,680 --> 04:18:46,479
minecraft rust reign of kings arc cone and exiles something but we can just openly just sort of rp

1162
04:18:46,479 --> 04:18:53,000
in on our own terms with our own rules in the server I want to see how long I last I want to

1163
04:18:53,000 --> 04:19:05,190
see if I have any loyal people that will protect me make it a weekly event that's the idea the

1164
04:19:05,190 --> 04:19:10,709
original title of the stream was going to be lazy fuck because I didn't do anything I just stood

1165
04:19:10,709 --> 04:19:15,430
around well everyone did everything for me and like money was poured into my like character's

1166
04:19:15,430 --> 04:19:39,319

1168
04:19:48,559 --> 04:19:54,639

1169
04:19:55,440 --> 04:20:04,399
hundreds of people participating not just like three so it's a kind of an evolution of that

1170
04:20:05,040 --> 04:20:12,450

1173
04:20:29,110 --> 04:20:35,829

1174
04:20:38,079 --> 04:20:43,200
on vegetables yeah but that's like no no no no no you that's like part of the recipe you don't

1175
