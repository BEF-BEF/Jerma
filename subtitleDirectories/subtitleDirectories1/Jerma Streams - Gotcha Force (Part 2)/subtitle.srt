1
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:13,939
Hey, how you doing? Welcome, everybody. Welcome back to live. I just pressed the

2
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:22,469
button and ran downstairs and grabbed water. Uh, let me make a tweet. We can start to play more

3
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:37,380
gotcha force. I'm pretty into it. I want to collect more fucking robots. No, stupid trapeze

4
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:44,890
simulator. I didn't even. Okay. I'm going to be honest. I forgot. I, I, I completely didn't even,

5
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:53,219
I forgot everything. I hit the stop streaming button and instantly it deleted from my brain.

6
00:00:55,219 --> 00:01:01,210
So what, what do you, what are you talking about? Like, can you guys somebody be specific with me?

7
00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:16,730
Like what, what is there a certain website? Is it a gone steam or is it a, are you serious?

8
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:35,989
What it's on Reddit trapeze simulator Reddit. Okay. The number one. Okay. When I type in trapeze

9
00:01:35,989 --> 00:01:48,040
simulator Reddit, the first search is Jerma promises to do trapeze simulator. Uh, what,

10
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:56,569
what is this? I know the first, okay, let me just go to this promises to do trapeze simulator. Okay.

11
00:01:56,569 --> 00:02:09,050
So what is it that when I type in trapeze simulator, there's nothing here. It's just,

12
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:15,689
I'm the third result. When you type in trapeze simulator, I'm the third that this, that exact

13
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:28,169
thing is the third result. And then there's this real simulation. It's like a, an EU right here.

14
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:37,639
This is not even real. Okay. Well, all right. It's excuse me for thinking it was real.

15
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:45,240
Like this game has released 500 times as different things, different objects.

16
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:54,069
So how would I know this was fake? Replace the word trapeze with another weird, hard to hold

17
00:02:54,069 --> 00:03:40,360
on to object. And that game has been made. Anyways, I got, I got to tweet that. Okay. Also,

18
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,080
I have a, I have something to tell you yesterday. We talked about this a little bit, but I'll give

19
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:51,300
you a little bit more details. Uh, there's a few things to talk about here. Uh, things talking

20
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:56,099
about number one, they may even be showing themselves right now. We do have new, some new

21
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:02,580
mods as of right now, I believe there are three new mods going through the process of adding mods,

22
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:13,099
mod apocalypse four. That's right. Yeah. Four, four. There are four new mods. I did this yesterday

23
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:21,189
and I don't even know. Uh, so we got, they're going to be a lot more of a presence of they'll

24
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:31,449
catch you. Oh, no, no, they'll catch you now. Uh, also on top of that, welcome them there.

25
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:36,660
There's been a process to bring some more on and we're not quite done.

26
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:44,420
Still some people would think we're going to be bringing on two. Besides that, also,

27
00:04:45,459 --> 00:05:03,019
I'm pleased to, to announce to you right now that, um, on, on, you ready? On May 15th

28
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:15,019
and May 16th, Easy Bay Govan stream and green screen DLC free back to back a couple of weeks

29
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:30,439
from now. It has been confirmed has been locked in. That's my birthday. Happy birthday. I can't

30
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:36,230
wait to do like a special birthday thing in front of the green screen. Why? That's a suggestion,

31
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:42,019
right? Is it a suggestion to like come in and it's your birthday and I'm like here for your

32
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:46,550
birthday and I can sit down and I enjoy your birthday. I mean, I've got, I have to give you

33
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:51,300
everything possible. Like, Oh, I want, I've always wished German was at my birthday. I'm going to

34
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,279
green screen myself celebrating your birthday and singing and stuff. And you can just, I'll,

35
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:01,000
I'll open my mouth in a weird way so you can literally just put any, any name there.

36
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,959
Like, I'll be like, Hey, and like open my mouth, Steve, you can do whatever you want.

37
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:23,000
Parasocial relationship. I was going to record myself just pretending to be your friend for like

38
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,040
three hours. I'm sitting, we're going to sit in your room together. We're going to watch TV.

39
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,839
How about this? All right. I will, I will green screen myself reacting to the entire

40
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:39,269
Witcher Netflix series, right? Like you won't be able to, it'll just be keyed.

41
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:44,230
It'll just be reacting off screen and you can queue it up. So then it could be like,

42
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:48,629
you know, I'm sitting there hanging out, just keyed into your living room while we watch the

43
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:58,139
Witcher three, the Witcher's entire sequence together. How fucked up would that be?

44
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:03,480
Rift tracks? No, no, no, no, no. It would just be me just hanging out in your living room with you.

45
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:14,120
We're just watching the Witcher on Netflix. That's, that's, uh, that's a probably a bad idea.

46
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,879
Well, there's a really hard TV show. Are you making a joke and a reference that the Witcher

47
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:29,740
three is like bad game or something? This is not a joke. Not stop. I know you, you will be kissed by,

48
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:40,230
by a love life. If you repost this four times in stream Lego Lord of the Rings. All right.

49
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:48,600
Let's play. Let's play. Uh, new mods. Shut it down. Hey, we got four new mods. Hey,

50
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:59,319
shut it down. Hey, those, those new blades need to be, need to be used, right? They're brand new.

51
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:05,750
They just came out of the blacksmith. Oh, swords. They haven't been touched. There's still this,

52
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:13,589
those new swords. All right. Come on. Come on. VR Josh. Uh, you haven't even peeled the plastic

53
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:19,819
off yours yet. Come on. Come on. Let's go use them. I know. No, but I want to leave the plastic

54
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:23,259
on as long as I can. Cause I, I want it to be like new and I want to take it, just take the

55
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:38,389
peel plastic off. VR Josh left. Oh, well, okay. Oh, okay. Oh, I see. Oh, I see how it is.

56
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:52,490
All right. Let's play. Welcome back everybody. That was a vehicle. Very. Yeah. I can't help it.

57
00:08:55,190 --> 00:09:01,419
He got it from me. You know, we, we hang out so often that he's, you know,

58
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:05,100
the other way around. What do you mean? We hung, we hang out so often that like, I just kind of do

59
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:14,840
some of his things. I got it from him. Full desk. Thanks. Hey, wait, what's on this desk?

60
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:26,389
There's a game cube. There's a TV changer beeper, two game cube controllers, block. Eh, kind of,

61
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:34,059
that's kind of a boring desk actually. No, I don't want to do verses. I'd say that's so cool

62
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:50,039
that you could do that though. Eraser is kind of pog though. Yeah. Veto the game. No, it's not

63
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:58,629
going to happen. It's not going to happen. Not going to happen. I love this game. I'm going to

64
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:11,049
play this shit out of this. It's just not going to happen. Let's take a look at our force. All

65
00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:18,299
right. Well, I got to figure out what I was doing. Play mega man legends. This game actually is just

66
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:31,080
plays exactly like mega man legends, except it's got dashes and dodges and toys. Lisa,

67
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:38,259
the painful waiting room. All right. I don't know. I don't know how many times I have to say

68
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:47,929
I am not. Can you? All right. I'm sort of green. All right. I was going to green screen myself

69
00:10:47,929 --> 00:10:53,830
playing all of Lisa, the painful and like you can just sit in your living room and we'll play

70
00:10:53,830 --> 00:11:01,379
it together. It's going to be a long green screen stream. It's going to be like 12 days long. Okay.

71
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:20,970
Now let's go. Who do I want for support? Nana. Why do that when you can just play it? Because

72
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:28,460
I want to be in your living room. I want to be in your living room. I got to get this right.

73
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:41,659
It's Jerma in your living room. I'll be in your living room tomorrow afternoon. You and me having

74
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:48,840
so much fun playing Lisa, the painful. So if you're into playing Lisa, the painful,

75
00:11:48,840 --> 00:12:07,019
then by all means join me tomorrow in your living room. Greg. Combine is going to be in my house.

76
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:14,730
Now he's actually going to do it. You know, dumb like that makes me laugh, but like I can't,

77
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:19,210
I can't do that in front of the, but that wouldn't make it. I can't, that would take too much time.

78
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:23,269
What's a really, really short game that I could beat in like 30 minutes?

79
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:31,460
No, that's, I'm not doing this. By the way, this character is so much better now.

80
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:49,210
It's like, it's unbelievable how much better he is. I missed bits, big bits, big bits. Uh, yeah,

81
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:58,419
you're right. $5,050 from phylactery lich. That's a huge amount of money. Thank you again for like,

82
00:12:58,419 --> 00:13:07,980
essentially what has turned into about $50 a day or a stream. It's insane. You're insane.

83
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,389
It's so much money. I can't even believe you still give me this much money.

84
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:22,330
Thank you. It's crazy. I can't, I can't even believe it. I say, don't you ever stop playing

85
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:26,730
gotcha force. If you haven't figured it out, the yellow icons on the map are side missions

86
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:32,970
and the orange ones are important. I'm not gonna know. I'm, I've liked this game and I'm going to

87
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:38,840
play it. I, I ain't going to get beautiful Joe bullied out of this one. Nope. Cause beautiful

88
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:45,799
Joe was, uh, like $11 and this one was 250. I ain't going to get bullied out of this one.

89
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:55,399
Nope. Not a chance. Not a chance in health. And this is one of my like favorite game cube

90
00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:09,539
game. Yup. No way. I'm going to beat the shit out of this game. He loves this game. I do. It's

91
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:17,700
just fun to play. And that's what matters. Are you having fun playing? Don't worry. I'll, I'm,

92
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,059
I'm going to record a green screen for every game you've ever wanted me to fucking play in your

93
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:26,070
living room with you. I don't, I won't even need to stream anymore. I'm just going to green screen

94
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:33,220
myself playing the entire steam library and I'll make a, I'll make a bot that's able to have,

95
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,940
replace every name with your name. You just put it in and anytime your name comes up, it's just,

96
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:47,159
it's me addressing you and I'll charge a modest fee for each video game. Hang out in your living

97
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:59,129
room session. I don't know, like 50 cents. That's a good idea. That would be so why not just a

98
00:14:59,129 --> 00:15:06,460
live stream 50 cents. Yeah. You know, what you do is you, you, you call my, you call my one 900

99
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:13,080
number I'm going to set up, which is a dollar 80 a minute. And it's me in your living room on your

100
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:29,850
phone. Holy shit. Nice teleport ninja sex line. All right. Can you imagine, let's just briefly go over

101
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:40,419
this back when it was like four or $5 a minute. Holy shit. Can you imagine sitting on that phone

102
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:59,750
for more than 10 to 20 minutes? That's absurd. That's expensive. It would cost me

103
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:10,440
$2. I'm so glad that I have turned on the mature content filter for the channel.

104
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:28,279
Very necessary at this point, I think. Uh, who's the new guy? Ooh, arm cutter, double

105
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:34,840
Kamaitachi and then ninpo teleport and then teleport slash. Teleport's a fun one to say.

106
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:39,879
That's a, that's a radio word. Teleport. Teleporting. Teleport. Teleport. Because the

107
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:47,559
E and the L and the E. Tele. Teleport. It's like saying W. W is a fun one to say too.

108
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:54,870
And even with a lot of consonants in the middle, they're a lot of fun. www.teleport.com. Yeah,

109
00:16:54,870 --> 00:17:02,620
that's fun. That was fun to do. Confuse his enemies with his smooth moves. Use the ninpo

110
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:07,900
teleport while moving to throw them off the scent and wait for your chance and hit them with the

111
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:20,410
teleport slash. Oh, I'll try it. He's expensive though. He's 400. What can I get rid of? Eh,

112
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:30,329
I got to clean up my toy shelf. This is bothering me. Can't afford anything else.

113
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:38,089
I got to clean up my Reddit. I was going to call it my Reddit shelf in the title,

114
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:50,710
but that's just dumping more charcoals onto this fire. I'm no, I could have, but that's just me

115
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:54,230
embracing the fact that that's what that is. And I kind of don't want to do that.

116
00:17:54,230 --> 00:18:04,140
Okay. Choke on the joke. Choke on the joke smoke.

117
00:18:07,339 --> 00:18:15,029
Oh, this guy, I like this guy. I like the little wing thing. What does this one do? Oh shit. Is

118
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:21,109
that like just a fucking, you just don't get hurt? How does that work? You can charge it.

119
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:44,200
Oh, it's okay. It's just you phase out. Does it hurt? If I get in there, is it going to be

120
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:51,910
hard to use? Play Minesweeper. This game sucks. Sorry. My Minesweeper is not a Minesweeper.

121
00:18:51,910 --> 00:19:05,990
Minesweeper. Not enough consonants in there. I don't like that one. Sorry. Oh fuck. Yeah,

122
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:16,619
this guy's not very good. Maybe you like him. What about his melee? Wasn't a bunch of flying

123
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:31,220
people. Oh, that guy sucks. He's $400. Look at how much better this dude is. And he's like,

124
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:45,750
he's $500 and still so much better. Omega LOL 400 or Omega LOLs. Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

125
00:19:46,549 --> 00:20:08,920
Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. There's more huge money coming. Hold on. Huge money. Is this on

126
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:20,650
the Commodore? No. This is on the Nintendo GameCube. Just trying to level up my crew

127
00:20:21,369 --> 00:20:36,890
so I can do the secret mission. The Nintendo ShipCube. Wow. That was clever. That was clever.

128
00:20:37,210 --> 00:21:00,039
Clever one. Oh, that was satisfying, but it didn't hit. Come on. I'm gonna stop it. Stop what?

129
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:16,140
Thank you. Fairy-kun gave $50. 5,000 bits. Another $50 drop. They say, hey, Jermbo.

130
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:22,579
I'm not sure if you saw, but the Pentagon released a video showing unidentified aerial phenomenon.

131
00:21:22,579 --> 00:21:26,660
That's a good one to say too. Unidentified aerial phenomenon. Thanks for giving me one of those

132
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:31,779
cool ones, which basically just means UFO. And I really want to rant about UFOs and aliens

133
00:21:31,779 --> 00:21:43,660
from my fellow Redditor. Um, well, I mean, is it weird to think that because you have a flat

134
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:54,420
screen TV that aliens had to have existed? All right. Like, we went from like putting

135
00:21:54,420 --> 00:22:00,660
corn in the ground to being able to talk to people through like a piece of plastic

136
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:08,920
and they can hear you 7,000 miles away. That's alien fucking technology. It has to be.

137
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:27,799
Ooh, a magnet robot minus. Somebody just wrote it all capitals. True. Oh, come on. Not another

138
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:34,059
normal night. Give me like a pro night. Give me like a hard mode night. Give me an insane night.

139
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:55,269
What's the minus? All right. Do I make like a comedy team or do I make like a plus and minus

140
00:22:55,269 --> 00:23:03,940
team? All right. Well, what's the difference? Magnet scope, magnet arm and beam. Okay.

141
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:12,740
The magnet robot minus was created by the natural resources unit. His magnet scope enables him to

142
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:17,940
collect materials like, yeah, the Pokemon or mines. His beam is used to modify collective.

143
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:29,369
So what's the difference? Why are you $10 more expensive to use? Oh, I'm sorry. Why do you cost

144
00:23:29,369 --> 00:23:39,750
10 more battery? I mean, I'll try. I'll try everything once each character gets one chance

145
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:47,740
to impress me. Otherwise they're going right in the fucking recycling. I got to clean this up.

146
00:23:48,740 --> 00:24:01,269
Looks like shit. All right. Let's, uh, that's fine. The name is Jumaas, but fairy cone. Thanks for

147
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:11,930
the $50 and the interesting thought project about aliens. Yes. I, I, I do believe that.

148
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:29,930
I think that has to be alien somewhere. There has to be. All right. You telling me if we're

149
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:33,980
supposed to be, if we're supposed to be some kind of, all right, we're going to get a little

150
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:40,380
philosophical here. So if, if like God created man and God created earth, whatever, don't you

151
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:45,559
think he made probably like fucking a hundred of these? Why would you make just one? If you had the

152
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:53,940
power to, why wouldn't you just make like a hundred? How would you make one? Or if you were like a group

153
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:57,700
of aliens that were like, you know what, let's fucking let's blow something up and make a bunch

154
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:06,230
of cells. You would do that like a thousand times. Wouldn't you? How do I ban you? What? I'm just,

155
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:09,910
I'm just talking. I'm just, this is a thought project. This is, I didn't say, by the way,

156
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:13,910
everything I believe. It's a thought. I said quote thought project before we started.

157
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:22,359
I don't know if you, if you were God and you made this like cool, like if you made like water

158
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,119
and you, and you built like this puzzle that is land on earth and shit, you made like,

159
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:31,480
you made like dinosaurs and monsters and aliens, would you just get you done?

160
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:40,099
No, you would do that like a bunch of times. Like, oh, that was fun. Those of you aren't people here.

161
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:45,779
Would you paint one fucking picture? Would you make one painting and go, that's it. That's the

162
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:50,359
best one. That's the only one I'm going to do. I'll never make another painting in my whole life.

163
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:56,900
It's the best. I'll never, you, I'll never pick up tools again. Oh, you, you would just draw,

164
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:03,559
you'd create, you would make, you would, you would create. Like, do you know what do you think God

165
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:10,180
has in his office? Just a hanging picture of earth. And he's the annoying, what, people come over and

166
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:16,519
he's like, yeah, I drew that. I made that 5,000 years ago. Nice. Yeah. You tell us every time.

167
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:25,180
Yeah. And he is, his whole house is just covered in like earth memorabilia. No, you would have,

168
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:28,940
you would do this millions of times. If you had the power to like point your finger and like,

169
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:36,650
and there's a fucking giraffe. You know how many characters I made in Spore? How many hours did

170
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:39,769
you spend in Spore? Well, I guess it probably took a long time. No, it took like 10, it looks

171
00:26:40,009 --> 00:26:46,410
seven days to make earth. No way. I spent, I spent, I spent at least like 25 days playing Spore.

172
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:58,390
There's no way. Just telling you, like if we're, if we're at experiment, people are like, wait,

173
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:07,450
we might be in a simulation. I don't know. Be the creationist. No, I'm just saying like this,

174
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:13,049
probably a bunch of like earths potentially, but I don't know. If you were God, wouldn't you make

175
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:18,329
like earth again, but just make people have no noses just because you, that's just, I decided

176
00:27:18,329 --> 00:27:25,400
to take their noses off this time on earth six trillion. How many of you guys that are art people

177
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:30,839
here? Because I mean, I'm one of you. I'm like, I'm okay. I come from a video editing standpoint

178
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:35,079
on this. You know how many times I've like cut shit out and like redone, redone the whole thing?

179
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:41,769
Like we're probably not supposed to have hands. That was like a, that was like a first draft.

180
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:47,349
And then like God's looking down going, holy shit. Yeah. I remember that. It was my first painting

181
00:27:47,349 --> 00:27:54,740
there. And look at the way they made their fucking hands. Whoa. That was so wrong. I've improved so

182
00:27:54,740 --> 00:28:21,000
much on earth two million. We are the first draft. Okay. Somebody said we are the first draft and

183
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:28,549
then a sad face. This guy's actually pretty good. I actually kind of like this. I like the beams.

184
00:28:30,859 --> 00:28:48,710
I like the beams. They're quality. I can see why you're worth 10 more battery points.

185
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:58,759
You're all permanently on the team. Why would you not be? This is right. Then why doesn't God

186
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:05,509
appear and yell to you? This is that what I'm saying is right. Um, do me a favor and yell to

187
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:12,059
your Sims. I don't, they're not going to respond to you. Why? Why? How come in the Sims four? When

188
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:21,029
you go, Hey, Hey, Julie, Julie, look at me. I'm up here. Fucking hear you. You'll pay for this.

189
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:58,220
My Sims talk to me sim, but Sims are not real, but, uh, we will, but how can you be so certain

190
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:20,920
that we're real? They obviously that was, Oh, finally I got a healer. Turn them off. Turn them

191
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:26,730
up. Oh yeah. We get big bits. I get it. Hold on. Oh, we did. Our luxury again, gave $50,

192
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:35,000
$5,000 more bits from phylactery, which brings it to a hundred dollars in bits today. Right now.

193
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:41,099
You say German, don't let German's alien rant distract you from the fact that he owns and

194
00:30:41,099 --> 00:30:53,140
wears a crystal healing bracelet. I don't wear cry. I don't, I don't wear a crystal healing

195
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:58,920
bracelet. Oh, look, I got, I just, I have, I have a little bit of, look, I have, listen,

196
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,400
listen to me. Look, I look, I have a little bit of black tourmaline

197
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,470
because I thought it was cool. Not because I think it has magical powers.

198
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:17,109
And I paired that with some quartz to, uh, clean my blood and sift my, uh, through my kidneys and

199
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:22,069
make me have cleaner pee or something. I don't know. It was interesting. It's interesting.

200
00:31:22,069 --> 00:31:26,630
I don't care. I don't think it, I don't think it's real. I don't think it's real. Look,

201
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:31,430
okay. Let me preface it again. I don't think that's real. It's just an interesting thought project.

202
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:43,900
It was, it's a thought project. Why'd you do it then? Why do people wear fucking like,

203
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:50,099
why do people wear rings and bracelets? I don't know, because they like, it's an accessory,

204
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:54,900
but I can't have an accessory. I don't think my accessories have magical powers.

205
00:31:55,859 --> 00:32:00,339
I just liked the idea of having like a little accessory and like the black tourmaline looked,

206
00:32:00,339 --> 00:32:11,160
it shined well and it was polished. Don't people believe, doesn't believe, wait, wait, wait, wait,

207
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:23,660
doesn't believe in God, but believes in healing crystals. I don't, I don't believe in healing

208
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:31,349
crystals. I, I believe, I believe in like medicine and science. All right. Let's, let me, let's be

209
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:43,660
clear. I believe in medical science. Okay. Do I have to say that? He's, now he's a Redditor.

210
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:55,849
That's a Redditor comment. Medical doctors. Oh, he's so enlightened. Why is me saying that

211
00:32:56,410 --> 00:33:06,420
believe in medicine of like an enlightened Redditor. Are you guys like smearing garlic

212
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:22,660
in your assholes? What's, what are you talking about? He's an edge lord. Oh, thank God. I put

213
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:29,099
that mature content filter on. Seems like I'm getting a lot of, a lot of mileage out of that

214
00:33:29,099 --> 00:33:42,789
one. I don't, the healers, no, crashed here, crash. All right. It's time for me to,

215
00:33:44,039 --> 00:34:00,819
uh, uh, Bitslave. Oh, Super Bruce. Oh, Super Bruce. Super Frog. Thanks for the 10 community

216
00:34:00,819 --> 00:34:09,699
subs. Super Bruce. 10 subs and then $50 from Bitslave. 5,000 Warp Bits. What's up, Jerma

217
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:14,340
Bitslave here. I'm currently trying to pass two kidney stones at the moment. Very painful.

218
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:21,659
I also recently got my League of Legends account permabanned. Stop playing. Yeah, stop playing.

219
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:26,219
I can just start reading books. You know what I mean? Like every time you have the urge to play

220
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:33,000
League, just read like two chapters of a book or something. It's too stressful and it's going to

221
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:40,860
make you mad and angry at stuff. Uh, it caused me worse pain than my stones, not because of the ban

222
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:52,179
because of this. Oh, how much money have I spent in the League of Legends? Here's how much you've

223
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:59,639
spent in League of Legends. Oh, damn. That's a lot of money. Damn. That's a lot of money.

224
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:03,480
Should I want, you want me to share this? That's a lot of money. Play Billy the egg, by the way.

225
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:18,260
I will. That's a lot. Damn. All right. Well, this makes me feel better about how many card

226
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:27,210
packs I bought in Hearthstone. You don't have any like, there's not like personal info on here,

227
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:58,619
right? All right. Here. We're going to do a big reveal. They said, share it. Damn. That's a lot.

228
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:11,320
That's a lot. And now you're, well, take that as a damn. That's a lot of money. Uh, hey, it's all

229
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:19,639
right. It's, it's just, it's, don't worry about it. It's all good. Don't go back. Let's put it this

230
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:27,349
way. Don't go back. You know what game you can play that's free. Doesn't cost anything. It's

231
00:36:27,349 --> 00:36:35,500
completely free. Kickball. It's free. Well, it's not, you're going to buy the ball and those are

232
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:48,179
like probably $5. It's fun. It's like a combination of, of soccer and baseball. Just be careful

233
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:53,699
because although the ball is very, very, it bounces easily and it's like a big bouncy ball

234
00:36:53,699 --> 00:36:57,699
and it makes a cool sound. I know the sound is awesome, but just be careful. I've seen plenty of

235
00:36:57,699 --> 00:37:02,099
plenty of pictures, especially teachers that used to be the picture. Cause I know that everyone was

236
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:06,019
concerned about this. The teachers would always be the picture because some kids kicked it way

237
00:37:06,019 --> 00:37:12,099
too hard and right into the teacher's face. Um, just be careful. Uh, you've got to be staying

238
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:20,460
back. That happened. It just happened at least three or four times with me growing up and their

239
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:24,619
glasses. They spent a bunch of time with their glasses, putting the glasses back on. It's like,

240
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:35,289
holy shit, this got rocked. Just be careful. It's gonna be dangerous, but it's fun. I'm supposed

241
00:37:35,289 --> 00:38:02,469
to be playing a game. Thanks for the 5,000 bits. Remember was a delinquent. What? No, we want more

242
00:38:02,469 --> 00:38:19,500
rants, more rants. No, I don't even know. I don't, I'm not even ranting. I'm doing a thought project.

243
00:38:20,059 --> 00:38:38,619
That's such a Redditor thing. I, this thing is, I don't, how do I kill this thing? How do I like

244
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:48,219
bury this Redditor thing? How do I do that? I know I have to have something else even more ridiculous

245
00:38:48,219 --> 00:39:03,130
and embarrassing happen so that you forget about the Redditor thing. Okay. I'm going to like take

246
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:05,929
a picture of, I'm going to have like a picture of, I'm going to turn the camera on one day and my

247
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:09,690
mouth is going to be full like hot dogs and like marshmallows. And I'm going to be like,

248
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:15,050
and be, I'm going to be like, I'm the Marshmallow Man, I'm the Marshmallow Man. And people are going

249
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:18,329
to be like, holy shit, he's fucking crazy. And then they, you'll, that'll be all you talk about

250
00:39:18,329 --> 00:39:47,559
for like six months. Perfect. 12 year old. Dude, I love this guy. He's got a sick move. Tom Green.

251
00:39:56,019 --> 00:40:01,349
I have hot dogs in my mouth. I'm a hot dog man. I have marshmallows in my mouth. I'm a Marshmallow

252
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:05,989
Man. I'm a Marshmallow Man. I'm a Marshmallow Man. I'm a Marshmallow Man. I'm a Marshmallow Man.

253
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:07,909
I'm a Marshmallow Man. I'm a Marshmallow Man. I'm a Marshmallow Man. I'm a Marshmallow Man.

254
00:40:07,909 --> 00:40:17,750
Yeah. I mean, that's funny. It was funny. It was kind of funny. I'll tell you one of my favorite,

255
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:24,070
the absolute best thing that I've ever seen Tom Green do. He did his show back on MTV. He was

256
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:28,869
like a weird, wild guy. He did all kinds of crazy shit. But this is the, my favorite thing that he

257
00:40:28,869 --> 00:40:33,750
ever did. Not like, wow, remember when he went and he like smashed the calculator? Remember when he

258
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:39,909
like peed his pants? No. He's sitting on a bench next to this old woman who's holding a cup. You

259
00:40:39,909 --> 00:40:46,150
can't see what's in the cup. And he continuously is interviewing this old woman. And he goes,

260
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:51,909
hey, I'm sitting here having, enjoying a nice Mountain Dew. And she's like, no, it's just a

261
00:40:51,909 --> 00:40:56,789
water. And she starts laughing. And he's like, oh, well, I mean, I'm sitting here. You're having a

262
00:40:56,789 --> 00:41:00,550
great time. We're hanging out on this bench. You're enjoying your Mountain Dew. And she's like,

263
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:06,550
no, it's a water. This is a water. And he's like, oh, wow, what a refreshing Mountain Dew.

264
00:41:07,829 --> 00:41:14,539
That seriously was like, I thought it was the funniest thing ever. I thought it was really

265
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:21,340
funny. Show it. By the way, you can't find this. I've already looked for it. I've already searched

266
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:27,260
for this. I've typed in like Tom Green, Mountain Dew, Tom Green, sits with old lady on bench.

267
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:42,889
It doesn't exist. It's gone forever. I didn't, I know I did not imagine it. It was the Mandela,

268
00:41:42,889 --> 00:41:49,989
Mandela effect. No, no, no, this happened. And then he keeps going. Do you like the way I dance?

269
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:54,949
Do you like the way I dance? And she's like, get out of here. This is water.

270
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:01,849
Wait, you got it? Wait, how did I not find this? When was this uploaded?

271
00:42:02,489 --> 00:42:14,820
No, this is fucking not even it. You're liars. This is when he's doing the daddy, would you like

272
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:20,500
some sausage thing? And was, yeah, no, here, here, here. It's not it. I've looked, trust me.

273
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:28,199
I seriously have looked for this. Tom Green, delicious soda. Wait, is this the delicious

274
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:36,920
soda? No, this is not it. This is not it. This is, it's an old lady on a bench.

275
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:50,860
This is not it. Oh no, this is important. Is this it? This is it. Tom Green, delicious soda. No,

276
00:42:50,860 --> 00:43:07,400
it's an old lady sitting on a bench. He dreamed it. You imagined it. No, I didn't. It's combined

277
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:38,010
memories. No, no, it's not. No. No, it's not it. Did you find it? This is it. Somebody got it.

278
00:43:44,039 --> 00:44:22,820
No, this is not it. What, what, is this it? No, it's not. No. I'm telling you, I looked at this

279
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:48,139
for like six years. You guys are wrong. Is it mixed memories? Here's a script. Hold on,

280
00:44:48,139 --> 00:45:06,599
there's a script for it. Here's the script. Okay, I have to go. It's not this one. It's a pie one.

281
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:12,730
All right, I'm going to, that's combined memories. I'm going to lose my fucking mind.

282
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:18,650
Park bench. You're just relaxing here today, enjoying a cigarette and a glass of Mountain Dew.

283
00:45:19,849 --> 00:45:26,889
That's water, I'll have you. No. Do you drink Mountain Dew? No. Do you drink Mountain Dew? No.

284
00:45:27,849 --> 00:45:33,929
Do you drink Mountain Dew? Hey, what are you doing? Okay, I'm going to do my little dance for you

285
00:45:33,929 --> 00:45:44,440
while you drink your water and then we'll go. Okay. Oh my god. There's no video.

286
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:54,199
That was the line.

287
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:16,440
There it is. Glass of Mountain Dew. All right, it was, all right, it was, I thought it was,

288
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:24,230
it was funny. I thought it was funny. I was like 15. I don't know. It's funny.

289
00:46:27,059 --> 00:46:37,500
But this is the worst joke of 2020 is I didn't make this joke. I'm reminiscing. I didn't like

290
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:41,420
teleport back in time and become Tom Green and do the Mountain Dew joke.

291
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:58,869
All right, what's the team look like? Looks good. Mixed memories. All right, do I have, am I good

292
00:46:58,869 --> 00:47:15,670
enough to do the, the secret one? No sound. I got you. Okay, here we go. No, it's mine. A baby

293
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:23,429
like you doesn't deserve a gotcha board, right? Kindly offered to use your gotcha board for you.

294
00:47:23,429 --> 00:47:33,989
You should accept his generous offer. What are you guys doing? Stop bullying. Yeah. Oh right,

295
00:47:33,989 --> 00:47:38,789
there was a video game here. Right, I forgot. It's been like 25 minutes of talking about

296
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:48,969
fucking aliens and how Tom Green was a funny reference. All right, I'm gonna, I gotta play well.

297
00:47:49,610 --> 00:48:02,170
All right, it's, wait, positive versus negative. Who wins? All right, get in there and punch.

298
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:12,139
Actually, no, stay back, stay back, stay back. Ah, you got me. Punch, punch,

299
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:20,699
twirl. All right, good. I might get something good from this. I'm excited. Whoa, what the,

300
00:48:20,699 --> 00:48:37,539
I thought that was my, no, it's not my ally. Remember, this hasn't, it hasn't been a game

301
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:47,510
this full time. It's just been a camera pointed at your pants. Okay, now that's funny. That would

302
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:52,679
be very funny. All right, we got some good trades going on here. This guy's gonna die.

303
00:48:53,559 --> 00:49:11,780
There we go. All right, we're doing well. All right, good trades on the, on, on the negative.

304
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:25,559
Now we close it up. Thurma, your Reddit penis is out. Oh, is it? Oh, by the way,

305
00:49:26,519 --> 00:49:34,139
somebody gave me a bunch of gold on Reddit. I have, I have, is that, okay, it's 200 gold a lot.

306
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:52,039
How much is that? It is, it's like an insane amount. It's 200. I don't know, somebody thinks

307
00:49:52,039 --> 00:50:00,389
that's really funny that I have like a ton of Reddit gold. 200 is fucking insane. Am I,

308
00:50:00,389 --> 00:50:04,840
I'll make sure I'm saying this right. Is there like other currency too? I have like three of them.

309
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:19,219
Okay, let's see. Yeah, I have 201.9k karma and 200 coins. What do I, what do I do with this?

310
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:35,300
Okay, where do I see that? Is there a way I can see how many coins I have? Reddit coins, 200.

311
00:50:40,409 --> 00:50:52,519
Guys, 200 coins is worth like 60 cents. Ooh, thunder robot. You guys are telling me that I

312
00:50:52,519 --> 00:51:08,760
had like $5,000 worth. Oh, okay. What is karma? Can you, all right. Why is there like a red dead

313
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:14,170
redemption thing on Reddit? Does this track like how many banks I've robbed? I don't understand.

314
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:24,840
What is karma? Ooh, hammer knight. Pretending not to know. I actually don't. I don't know what,

315
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:29,420
what that means. How high can it go? Is there a maximum it can go? By the way,

316
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:46,389
I'm glad we actually got those. How high can karma go? Reddit gold redemption. Seems pretty good.

317
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:56,309
Reddit gold redemption. Thunderwire. Ah, it's this guy. When are you going to do an AMA?

318
00:51:56,949 --> 00:52:02,900
Why would I do an AMA when you can just ask any question and I will just probably answer it.

319
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:11,050
Reddit AMAs are just Jerma one guys. Like that's why I don't know why I did. There's no point.

320
00:52:11,849 --> 00:52:18,820
The robot type got you board who belongs to the special attack machinery unit.

321
00:52:19,539 --> 00:52:24,980
This Thunderwire shows its true power when strung between allies. Walk onto an ally to set it up.

322
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:43,239
He's a support, but they get hammer night on a POG. He's got a cool outfit on rolling

323
00:52:43,239 --> 00:52:50,179
hammer and hammer shot. This got you. Borg is warrior in the night board court is a shield

324
00:52:50,179 --> 00:52:54,179
and a hammer, which he can throw at enemies. Use the rolling hammer to blow away your foes.

325
00:52:55,139 --> 00:53:07,099
Give him a try. Do a Reddit polygraph saying things that I don't have. I don't know what they are.

326
00:53:10,489 --> 00:53:18,099
Um, okay. Who do I? We'll try the thunder robot too. They all fit. No, you're too expensive.

327
00:53:18,739 --> 00:53:24,500
Or maybe you're too expensive and then we'll put a ninja. All right. I got to clean this up.

328
00:53:26,199 --> 00:53:31,400
I know I keep saying that I keep opening up my closet and seeing this and going, I got to clean

329
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:49,139
this and I never do. Let's do this other one. Pro rock. What? Stop playing games in the wrong

330
00:53:49,139 --> 00:54:05,940
aspect ratio. Uh, this is the game that was 480 P that's being blown up and upscaled to 720,

331
00:54:06,579 --> 00:54:15,900
which is being streamed to you at what are you talking about? You want to put this in four by

332
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:36,619
three? Why would I do that? No, because it's being upscaled to 720. It'll be funny. It's too

333
00:54:36,619 --> 00:54:46,820
stretched. No, it's not. It isn't. Trust me. This is how, okay. Remember this is the Wii.

334
00:54:47,619 --> 00:54:52,420
So it's going through the Wii and the Wii is taking it and this is just playing a GameCube

335
00:54:52,420 --> 00:55:08,329
game on a Wii. This is what it looks like. Actually, this dude's pretty good. I like the

336
00:55:08,329 --> 00:55:22,860
ball. The ball, this guy's good. I think I found a character I like. That's good straight line.

337
00:55:23,579 --> 00:55:50,460
Plus he kind of looks like a ninja turtle. I like him. That does a lot of damage. He's good.

338
00:55:52,119 --> 00:56:06,010
Look at how good he is. All right. He does not have a combo. That's good to know. He's got a

339
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:19,050
shield too. Look at this dude. Sorry. He did a lot. All right. Thunder. All right. So let's do

340
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:37,260
lightning zap. So now we're connected. Where are we? This has to go through an ally. He's just

341
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:56,409
spraying everywhere. How do I target an ally? Z is lock on. Well, yeah, but I can't. I'm trying

342
00:56:56,889 --> 00:57:08,780
Isn't this the one that goes to an ally? Z. Hold Z. Hold Z. Hold Z. Z. Is my ally dead?

343
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:45,429
Oh, he's dead. It's all right. Let's just fucking end this. Oh shit. Nice. That's what we call

344
00:57:45,989 --> 00:58:02,329
performance. Performance anxiety. No, that's called performance. Although I gotta be careful

345
00:58:02,329 --> 00:58:11,369
because I don't want to lose. Oh boy. I'm going to lose. What do I have left? Oh, that's not good.

346
00:58:12,699 --> 00:58:34,139
It is actually time to get serious. Oh, it's fine. Oh, you motherfucker. No, I got too

347
00:58:34,139 --> 00:58:50,920
caught up in not. I don't know. This little kid sucks. This thing sucks too. I like you. You can

348
00:58:50,920 --> 00:59:20,179
stay. All right. We need a heavy hitter. You. You're up. You. You go first. 4-3 or die.

349
00:59:24,489 --> 00:59:30,409
You don't want it in 4-3. I have to unplug the HDMI cables. I don't even have the other cables.

350
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:49,340
All right. Here we go. Let's try this again. Do it in OBS. But then I have to recalibrate it all.

351
00:59:50,659 --> 01:00:23,019
No, it's going to take forever for me to fix it. Hold on. You ready? Sure. Authentic.

352
01:00:28,570 --> 01:00:49,769
You don't want it like this. Yes, we do. Yes, we do. We do. What? You don't. This is like.

353
01:00:50,329 --> 01:01:10,599
No, I'm going back. No, I got to. All right. I got first of all, instead of paying attention

354
01:01:10,599 --> 01:01:22,119
to the putting the game in four by three ratio, I've got to win. Get this dick head out of here.

355
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:43,480
How is this default enemy beating me around 640 by 40 like God intended?

356
01:01:44,119 --> 01:02:05,059
Yeah, just like God intended. Attack. Attack. All right. You got to get away. Yeah, she's

357
01:02:05,059 --> 01:02:26,380
died. Got it. All right. No, how are you still alive? You're annoying me. Face cam on a riot.

358
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:40,019
No, spit. Oh, that's a riot then.

359
01:02:44,179 --> 01:02:44,659
Riot.

360
01:02:50,869 --> 01:02:52,230
No, don't do that. Shut up.

361
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:27,099
Come on. I got to kill you. I'm so fucking mad. I'm so fucking mad. Oh, my God. These guys are

362
01:03:27,099 --> 01:03:52,940
fucking killing me. Dude, dude, this is stupid. I need flyers. That's the issue.

363
01:03:53,900 --> 01:04:07,860
I need flyers. Bad. I need flyers. All right. Let's move. Cool. Nice move to have there. It's

364
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:24,809
not for me to fuck. I'm just going to spam. All right. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're

365
01:04:24,809 --> 01:05:01,260
good. Shit. What the fuck keeps happening to my shitty teammate? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

366
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:23,960
feel my wrath. Who's saying that? Me? All right. This is it. I win. Goodbye. Ivan, Ivan, Ivan, Ivan.

367
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:28,519
All right. Well, what was everybody freaking out about? Oh, no, right. Change this shit back.

368
01:05:29,639 --> 01:06:01,670
I don't like this at all. Okay. No, I can't. That hurt. But all right. I'll meet you in the middle.

369
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:06,039
Okay. I'm going to meet you guys in the middle. I'm not going to do four, three. We're not going

370
01:06:06,039 --> 01:06:14,150
to do 16 by nine. We're going to do like five by seven. We're going to do a standard piece of

371
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:40,300
computer paper. Not stretching it yet. Hold on. It hasn't been stretched. Okay. All right. All right.

372
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:52,380
See? There we go. Look at that. No, that's we can all agree with this. We can all agree.

373
01:06:53,900 --> 01:07:02,260
Not too far. Big. Not too far. You know, small. And it fits. It looks good. I knew somebody was

374
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:10,440
going to call me a centrist. That's fine. It's off center. Don't worry. I got it.

375
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:31,219
Ooh, a wind Valkyrie. There we go. Okay. Now everyone can be happy. I got it. It's not off

376
01:07:31,219 --> 01:07:46,059
center anymore. Hold on. Maybe a little bit. Now we can all be happy. See? Now it's like not quite

377
01:07:46,059 --> 01:07:53,900
four, three, but it's not 16 by nine and it's not. You guys just. That's all I need to say is

378
01:07:54,860 --> 01:08:10,570
the same as before. No, it's not. Before it was the whole screen. Compromise makes no one happy.

379
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:17,449
What's that old saying? As long as both sides are unhappy, that means you came to an agreement.

380
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:27,989
Who said that? Who said that? What's that? There's a famous quote from a guy from Pasta Italiano.

381
01:08:27,989 --> 01:08:33,750
No, no, no, no, no. There's like a, oh, if there's, you can tell if both parties are unhappy,

382
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:37,590
then that means something worked out. Winston Churchill said it or something.

383
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:44,739
You can tell if he did a good job negotiating when both parties are unhappy. What'd he say?

384
01:08:49,109 --> 01:08:55,989
That was not, that was not, that was not Adolf Hitler. It was not Adolf Hitler.

385
01:08:58,569 --> 01:09:02,250
I know it was not. I was like fucking Winston Churchill or something.

386
01:09:16,010 --> 01:09:25,340
No, what? Both. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What is it?

387
01:09:25,979 --> 01:09:29,979
A good compromise is when both parties are dissatisfied. It was Larry David.

388
01:09:29,979 --> 01:09:39,699
That was Larry David. Good. Perfect. Yes. He's quoting Hitler. No, I'm quoting Larry David.

389
01:09:40,500 --> 01:10:00,699
Quoting Hitler. It was Larry David. Okay. No. All right. That's it.

390
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:09,800
Oh, I love Larry David. He's funny. And it was, yeah, it was Larry David.

391
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:31,529
That's a centrist ideology. Everyone should suffer. It's a computer aspect ratio.

392
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:44,949
Holy shit, man. I can't believe, I can't believe this streamer here is,

393
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:55,159
he's just, I mean, that's, I think Hitler said this. I wanted it 4-3. I wanted it 60 by 9.

394
01:10:55,159 --> 01:11:27,189
This guy's Hitler. All right, let's go. Tunnel vision? No. German's in the back pocket

395
01:11:27,189 --> 01:11:44,539
of big plasma trying to push his widescreen narrative. Big plasma. Oh, but it's, it's,

396
01:11:44,539 --> 01:11:49,670
but it's classic. Well, how come you don't use it for every aspect ratio then?

397
01:11:50,630 --> 01:11:58,229
Put your fucking, put your monitor right now in 4 by 3. 640 by 480. Good. Wow. So good. You like

398
01:11:58,229 --> 01:12:06,710
it so much. Go boot up. Go, go boot up. Go boot up TF2 and put it in fucking 360p.

399
01:12:07,670 --> 01:12:31,079
Let's see how long you crack like a fucking egg. I always have it in 360. No, no, no, no, no.

400
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:36,199
By the way, I'm not talking about the people that have the Dell computer all the way at the left.

401
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:48,470
On the shelf at Best Buy. I know I've been one of those people before. That's doing pretty well.

402
01:12:56,329 --> 01:13:02,119
Generic computer. Yeah, you can always tell which one it is. It's all the way to the left

403
01:13:02,119 --> 01:13:12,390
and it has no specs. Just says very fast processor, Intel, Intel processor. It's just

404
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:22,409
not even a quad core. Perfect for emails. There are no graphics card in there. It's integrated.

405
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:43,699
What do you mean? What do you mean Intel in 2020? But you don't Intel. I'm sorry. I like

406
01:13:43,699 --> 01:13:50,279
the company that has the clean boost technology. Makes you whites whiter and your brights brighter.

407
01:13:50,920 --> 01:14:23,670
This guy is really good. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.

408
01:14:23,670 --> 01:14:31,689
All right. All right. All right. We got some new mods here. Take that plastic off. Take that

409
01:14:31,689 --> 01:14:48,630
plastic off those swords and get ready to use them. Who's our next monkey? What is it? Oh,

410
01:14:49,430 --> 01:15:03,939
finally we got our upgraded ninja. I'm not sure. I don't know what's going to be in here.

411
01:15:03,939 --> 01:15:22,010
It's uncertain. It's another. Oh, we can make an entire ninja party. Yep. All right. This is

412
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:33,050
ridiculous. This is disgusting to me. This is disgusting me. Well, first of all, let's read

413
01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:47,420
about our new friend. Almighty type. Pretty good speed. Shuriken. Shinobi. Yatana.

414
01:15:53,159 --> 01:16:08,170
Nympho. Kage. Bunshin. I'm fucking human. I'm a human. You don't sit there and like play a game

415
01:16:08,170 --> 01:16:11,529
and no one's listening to you when you do it. When you just sit there and you go,

416
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:16,729
oops. Don't worry. There's not like 5 trillion people that laugh at you.

417
01:16:17,130 --> 01:16:24,100
I'm just a fucking human. All right. We produce all kinds of organisms inside of us.

418
01:16:24,899 --> 01:16:31,140
Did you know that at any moment right now, at any given second, there are 500 trillion living

419
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:37,380
organisms in your body, inside of your rectum and your intestinal tract and some in your stomach,

420
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:47,000
you have acid. We're fucked. Humans are gross. Right now you have a bowl of acid inside of you

421
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:51,319
in your stomach and there's pee in there too. There's a bag of piss inside of you right now.

422
01:16:51,319 --> 01:16:55,960
It's a bag filled with pee and there's shit in there. You have like a big shit going down

423
01:16:55,960 --> 01:17:12,100
to you right now. It's in you right now, but he's disgusting. He burped. I'm eating. Yeah.

424
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:17,189
And there's all those gross like food particles going into your stomach right now. They're getting

425
01:17:17,189 --> 01:17:21,029
burned by the acid and then like humans, we're disgusting animals.

426
01:17:24,409 --> 01:17:37,189
Wow. I'm playing a video game. All right. Let's wait. I can duplicate myself with this clone.

427
01:17:38,069 --> 01:17:46,500
This ninja's attacks are doubly deadly. Divide and conquer. Oh, I cause you've turned into two

428
01:17:46,500 --> 01:18:00,920
people. We see iPod auto. It's iPod auto. Wait, what? Why does this dog have a, I don't get it.

429
01:18:01,399 --> 01:18:17,619
That's not auto. What is this? There's a dachshund with like a shirt t-shirt on. That's auto.

430
01:18:17,619 --> 01:18:49,449
That's not auto. That is not auto. Why? Where did you get this? It does look like auto. Auto

431
01:18:49,449 --> 01:19:00,310
has a shorter face though. Auto's face is a little, it's not as long. This is very cute dog though.

432
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:16,220
I've had auto. Show the real auto. No, I need to clean up my room. Okay. Here we go.

433
01:19:16,859 --> 01:19:25,829
Okay. Look at that attack. Look at this attack damage is insanity.

434
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:33,159
Shuriken, shinobi physical attack, and then shuriken cutter. Deadliest gotcha borg in the

435
01:19:33,159 --> 01:19:38,520
assassination unit. The big shuriken on his back is made of extremely heavy, durable metal

436
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:54,710
so it can slash through anything. Well, let's make our team. I want you first. Okay. I want,

437
01:19:55,510 --> 01:20:01,899
I like ball. I like the shield and ball. Oh yeah. We got this wind Valkyrie. Didn't we just get

438
01:20:01,899 --> 01:20:10,630
wind Valkyrie? Probably one of the fastest characters in the game. Butterfly fan, magic

439
01:20:10,630 --> 01:20:16,489
shot, big fan and fly. This angel borg enjoys flying and even sleeps while floating in the air.

440
01:20:17,130 --> 01:20:20,890
The winds blowing through the mega borg planet are created by the wind Valkyrie.

441
01:20:22,970 --> 01:20:31,079
Big fan. Oh, we'll give her a try. All right. Let's get this squared away here.

442
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:50,220
We're going to do the ninja unit up top. Yo, you too. I want you in here. All right. Where's,

443
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:59,800
we got flying figurines over here. What's this one? What's this one, two, three? What's this? I

444
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:13,140
don't get it. Why are these here? Robots are going to go down here. We're going to have robots. We're

445
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:27,420
going to have knights. Okay. Robots down here. Knights will be here. Oh, this is a ninja,

446
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:37,100
but I don't want you on my team. All right. This is a Kung Fu master, kind of like a boxer.

447
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:54,300
All right. Well, you go up here. Press Y to sort. Borg list. No, menu, change force name,

448
01:21:54,939 --> 01:22:07,029
the lead of force. Borg list. Press Y to sword. No, you can't sort like that. We need a new force

449
01:22:07,029 --> 01:22:15,819
name. We don't know what we want permanently. I can't ask the wait. We'll do, okay, flying over

450
01:22:15,819 --> 01:22:29,260
here. Who else can fly? Fly. Okay. Then we're going to have knights and melee characters

451
01:22:29,899 --> 01:22:51,689
underneath. Okay. Melee character. And then we're going to do it by cost. This is technically not

452
01:22:51,689 --> 01:23:00,739
a melee character. It's just a robot. Okay. Claw bot. Okay. Here we go. We're going to have

453
01:23:00,739 --> 01:23:16,149
shooter characters after this. Claw robot under robot. I like you better. So you go here. Oh,

454
01:23:16,149 --> 01:23:28,779
melee. Oh, sorry. Melee playing favorites. Yes, I am. What are you? Okay. Gunner. Guns. Guns.

455
01:23:29,819 --> 01:23:43,060
Spinner girl. Uh, kind of, I don't know. Miscellaneous. Where am I? These are people

456
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:51,670
that just shoot shooters and then miscellaneous and support will go over here. I don't know what

457
01:23:51,670 --> 01:24:02,659
to do with you there. And now I actually have like a decent, decent now. What is this for?

458
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:13,539
I'm going to take you for a ride. I'm going to take you for a ride.

459
01:24:22,439 --> 01:24:31,989
You're just powerful. You go like, okay, it's clean now. I can actually take a look and see

460
01:24:31,989 --> 01:24:39,560
this is the ninja category. This is the, what are you doing up here? This is a shooter category,

461
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:48,789
robot category, flyer category, melee category, and then support category. Perfect. All right.

462
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:58,470
So I want that's pretty much. Oh, no, I can do 350. Who, who, who, who? Tell me. I don't know.

463
01:24:58,470 --> 01:25:11,800
I don't know. I don't know, man. Who? This guy, I don't just get a raid. All sham, no wow. What's

464
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:22,970
going on, dude? Thanks for the raid. Welcome everybody. Hope you're doing well. Welcome to

465
01:25:22,970 --> 01:25:28,699
the fucking channel. All sham, no wow is a really, really good dude. It's been a while since we've

466
01:25:28,699 --> 01:25:38,390
talked. Let's change that. Here's my phone number. Five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five,

467
01:25:38,390 --> 01:25:46,779
five, five, five, five, five, five, five. Good work. Hit me up on discord, man. It's been a while.

468
01:25:47,420 --> 01:25:51,060
Do I even have you on discord? I don't think I do. What a fucking bad friend.

469
01:25:51,779 --> 01:26:09,800
But welcome. We're playing gotcha force, a game about robots and toys and people love it.

470
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:20,739
Trust me. Who should I put in the last swap though? Don't tell them how much it costs.

471
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:30,300
They don't need to know that. Maybe just a regular night. Yeah. Two regular nights. Oh,

472
01:26:31,340 --> 01:26:46,119
oh, he said there's a big team. Okay. We're good. He's not forcing us to like it.

473
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:57,829
I'm not forcing anybody to like anything. This is a completionist dream. Yes. I believe the game

474
01:26:57,829 --> 01:27:05,270
never ends either. It's somebody said that it goes to infinite new game plus, but please give it a

475
01:27:05,270 --> 01:27:11,449
three out of 10. Can't believe that missed a great game. All right. Let's check this dude out. He's

476
01:27:11,449 --> 01:27:25,079
got 30, 30. That's a lot of ammo spots. All right. Kind of cool. All right. His, his huge

477
01:27:25,079 --> 01:27:37,880
cosplay foam is getting in the way. I feel like this dude would have trouble crossing the blizzard

478
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:55,579
state. Whoa. This guy's actually really good. Let me try to get that. Did you just see how much

479
01:27:55,579 --> 01:28:13,020
damage that did? This dude's fucking insane. Oh, he's got a really good movement too.

480
01:28:13,739 --> 01:28:32,979
Kind of hard to catch up to a plane. Whoa. I just like flying squirrel. God damn it. All right.

481
01:28:32,979 --> 01:28:47,739
Just hit the ally. Do something. Oh, I just got bombed. That shreds. It shreds people. He's dead,

482
01:28:47,739 --> 01:28:57,850
but it shreds people. All right. What about this dude? Okay. I think I have to charge it and I turn

483
01:28:57,850 --> 01:29:15,270
it to two. Whoa. Two bombs. This is awesome. How is it last? All right. Elastic. Let's do it again.

484
01:29:15,989 --> 01:29:37,020
You have to stand still though. That's not good. Bam. Come on. Double. Oh, I was so fun to sit

485
01:29:37,020 --> 01:29:47,020
there and hit that button over and over again. I'm sorry. He's slow as shit. I'll get him double

486
01:29:47,020 --> 01:30:05,750
melee attack. Let's go. No, let's not do that. Actually. Let's not do that. Run away. I don't

487
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:13,560
think I can replace these guys. Oh yeah. When you get like at least 40% of them to hit.

488
01:30:15,659 --> 01:30:19,819
One issue with these guys is going to be bad is when this thing's moving around very fast

489
01:30:19,819 --> 01:30:44,380
and you cannot charge that up and stand still. He's got a lot of health. All right. He's going

490
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:48,619
to be. Look at that bar. He's going to be a huge chunk of that bar. His health is probably like

491
01:30:48,619 --> 01:30:53,479
500. Yeah. Look at that. One more guy. It's not a tank. All right. Let's see if we can dance

492
01:30:53,479 --> 01:31:13,020
around you and slash you up a little bit. Oh, how did you do predicted my movement?

493
01:31:13,659 --> 01:31:28,680
There we go. I just double tapped him. These dudes have so much health.

494
01:31:33,479 --> 01:31:35,800
Oh, now I got him in the corner. You're fucking screwed.

495
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:58,500
There was resolve has been tested. He's paranoid. Cool. All right. We have this is the next. This

496
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:04,539
is the story mission. Make sure we're going in with what we want. I didn't even use this character.

497
01:32:05,180 --> 01:32:09,020
I like them both. All right. This is an important mission. So

498
01:32:09,899 --> 01:32:18,260
I'm going to have to use the things I like. I think that too many ninjas in a row spread

499
01:32:18,260 --> 01:32:39,079
them out a little bit to 410 points. That's kind of, uh, use the teleport ninja. Yeah, I guess.

500
01:32:40,439 --> 01:32:46,060
I wouldn't teleport kind of doesn't make any sense to me. You could use spike head.

501
01:32:46,699 --> 01:32:53,699
Now he's 470. I could take out. I'll try it. I'll try it, but I want to break it up a little bit.

502
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:59,029
No, it can't just be quick, quick, quick, quick, quick. These guys are all just quick and weak.

503
01:32:59,829 --> 01:33:16,539
I'll try it. What is awesome. Yeah. I'm just kind of cooperate with us. I get to beat the ICBM tanks.

504
01:33:25,670 --> 01:33:48,600
Looks like a pretty good team. Beat enemy. Gotcha. Borgs. Yes. Oh, it's hitting the lip.

505
01:33:49,479 --> 01:34:12,500
No. Oh, well, you got to get over there, man. How do you avoid that? Quick, quick, quick. Get it.

506
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:18,039
Get it. Get it. Get it. Don't let him do it. That's a jump. Where do I go? Teleport out of it.

507
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:31,609
Teleport. Do I, can I get one of these tanks? I think I'm going to die. I just have to jump.

508
01:34:32,170 --> 01:34:52,619
Oh shit. One didn't hit me. Die. Die before it kills us. Holy shit. I got it. You definitely can

509
01:34:52,619 --> 01:35:12,659
get that nuke, by the way. No way you can't. All right. Let's keep it up. Crash Course, part two.

510
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:36,819
You can get everything, even the dragons. That's so cool. Who we go for first? Over here.

511
01:35:45,270 --> 01:35:56,550
That was a double. Stay in, stay in, stay in, stay in. Oh my God. This dude is as good

512
01:35:58,380 --> 01:36:08,710
as Spikehead. What was his name? Boogerberry or something. Boogerberry is just Bugleberry,

513
01:36:08,710 --> 01:36:14,380
but okay, you know how Snoopy has Spike and Spike's like kind of a little, like more rough.

514
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:35,350
Boogerberry is Bugleberry's Spike. Oh, it's Bogus. What? Die. I got to trade here. There we go.

515
01:36:35,350 --> 01:36:46,579
It's a Bugleberry anti-hero. What do you have that for? Is it, is it a shield?

516
01:36:49,369 --> 01:37:09,430
Oh, that's all right. Out of here. Stay in front so I can use the shield. One more hit.

517
01:37:09,430 --> 01:37:23,880
Oh, one more hit. Turn off the music and please sing for us instead. I don't think you're gonna

518
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:42,899
want that. Oh, it's all right. We got a, okay, teleport ninja. How much damage does this do?

519
01:37:51,899 --> 01:37:57,899
Okay. Starting to understand. Oh, I'm starting to understand why this character is good.

520
01:37:57,899 --> 01:38:23,060
Understood. All right. Nuke. Give us a nuke. Do I take donations? Um, I, you can give bits.

521
01:38:23,619 --> 01:38:41,850
I don't have like a PayPal or anything though. Command girl. I gotta check my crystals.

522
01:38:41,850 --> 01:39:03,960
Command girl is the best. Command girl is so good. Really? Uh, just zero attack. Defense,

523
01:39:04,039 --> 01:39:13,930
shooting, and attack. Speed, beam, and buster laser. An assassin from the planet

524
01:39:13,930 --> 01:39:18,329
Megaborp who was equipped with a beam gun. She relies on her weapons but avoids,

525
01:39:18,890 --> 01:39:30,649
oh, she just can't, no melee at all. All right. What are you doing over here? You're supposed to

526
01:39:30,649 --> 01:39:43,159
be over in the flyers. You're supposed to be down here with the shooters who, oh, get rid of you.

527
01:39:43,159 --> 01:39:50,699
I know you're good. Uh, you're good too. You're also good, but I, we'll try. Yeah,

528
01:39:50,699 --> 01:40:01,739
I'll take you off now. See how command girl is still doing the singing thing. No, it's crypto.

529
01:40:03,609 --> 01:40:11,909
Yeah, I, I, we're, we, yes, I had an Ethereum address that I had there and it was,

530
01:40:12,470 --> 01:40:21,369
hey, look, check it out. It's, you can send ether, Ethereum, crypto, and it was there for about

531
01:40:21,369 --> 01:40:29,079
six and a half, seven months. That took in about, I believe, six or seven dollars worth of Ethereum

532
01:40:29,079 --> 01:40:37,109
over six or seven months. So, which that's, that's fine. It's, it's not like, oh, I didn't,

533
01:40:37,109 --> 01:40:42,170
nobody gave me enough money, so I'm deleting it. It just wasn't really used and I, it was just like,

534
01:40:42,649 --> 01:40:54,760
people don't really care anymore. You are CNN ass streamer fucking nerd. What does that mean?

535
01:40:56,819 --> 01:41:03,960
I, I'm trying, what I, why do I like, I'm like, I'm piecing together what you're talking about.

536
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:13,850
That's exactly what I just made fun of. What did I make fun of? What did I do? All right,

537
01:41:13,850 --> 01:41:34,069
this is going to be a hard fight. Okay. I probably shouldn't have started with, uh,

538
01:41:35,779 --> 01:41:41,899
with vacuum cleaner girl, whatever that is, with big boxing glove vacuum.

539
01:41:45,239 --> 01:41:56,979
Oops. Well, we got to fight five people at the same time. No, she definitely doesn't suck. I just

540
01:41:56,979 --> 01:42:16,699
can't, you know, I'm fighting a full team. I'm hitting somebody. These motherfuckers can't even

541
01:42:16,699 --> 01:42:27,909
take me down. I'm doing some good damage. Get out. Sorry, I did a lot of damage. All right,

542
01:42:27,909 --> 01:42:48,539
clean it up. Good. Focus, focus, focus on them. Don't let them get away. This is your time to

543
01:42:48,539 --> 01:43:07,880
shine. You just transformed, but he's dead. Oh, you just keep his own guy. Yeah. Your teamwork

544
01:43:07,880 --> 01:43:50,489
is not. All right, let's go. Come on. One hell. Oh, all right. That was a bad team for this.

545
01:43:50,489 --> 01:44:12,550
Show us your J O crystal. I don't know what that is. CNN player. Okay. We're going to change this.

546
01:44:13,189 --> 01:44:33,340
We need beef. Okay. Uh, you're good, but not now. We need beef. Uh, bubble night did pretty good.

547
01:44:33,979 --> 01:44:51,210
You did all right, too. You can stay 230. Who can I put in? No, I need beef. I'm going to regret

548
01:44:51,210 --> 01:45:20,180
this, but here's your one shot. Look at the crystals. Confirm. All right. And one, two, one,

549
01:45:20,260 --> 01:45:30,739
C. Damn. I need one more. Oh, and one, two, one, B and one, two, one, C.

550
01:45:31,779 --> 01:45:49,430
I need N one, two, one, a, and I get this thing. Damn it. Oh, well, go and get it.

551
01:45:50,069 --> 01:45:59,939
That's easier. All right. We're giving hatchet night a chance here. I take you off and I had

552
01:45:59,939 --> 01:46:06,439
a five 90. I didn't realize just how expensive hammer night actually was. That's insanely

553
01:46:06,439 --> 01:46:26,409
expensive. Um, I can put you back in. I got two 80, three 30 or 80 double ninja. Yeah.

554
01:46:27,510 --> 01:46:34,500
All right. We'll try this. You're ignoring chat. Somebody said they lost their J O crystal.

555
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:44,329
Feels bad, man. LODs support jail crystals. Feels bad, man. J O crystal. I'm, why am I ignoring chat?

556
01:46:44,329 --> 01:46:54,170
Stop saying that. I'm what? First I'm ignoring everybody and now I'm addressing what everyone's

557
01:46:54,170 --> 01:47:24,170
saying. And now I'm, don't stop addressing us. Run away. Oh, okay. That's what that is. Sure.

558
01:47:24,729 --> 01:47:29,819
All right. Let's continue this, by the way, this, like I said, this is, this is hatchet night's

559
01:47:29,819 --> 01:47:42,550
one shot. If you're a hatchet night supporter and have to see you in the chat,

560
01:47:42,630 --> 01:48:05,939
this is the only shot he's going to get. All right. He's benched.

561
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:32,760
Maybe one day he'll get a shot. I got to focus on one person at a time. You,

562
01:48:33,399 --> 01:48:40,819
you're dead. That's got like everybody. Look, I'm not, I look, I got a lot of damage in there.

563
01:48:40,819 --> 01:49:13,270
All right. Here we go. Comes the equalizer. He instantly died. Are we about to see somebody

564
01:49:13,270 --> 01:49:46,819
always have a spot on my team? Oh, there's always a spot for you. There's always a spot for you now.

565
01:49:46,899 --> 01:50:13,060
Okay. Cocky double ninja always gets a spot. No matter what big bits by Lacta re even more

566
01:50:13,060 --> 01:50:27,850
huge money drops. Ooh, it's like a punch guy. 50 Thomas, another 50 bucks. You're a J O crystal

567
01:50:27,850 --> 01:50:36,039
is like a little talisman you use with your bros. You guys all hang out and just kind of do this.

568
01:50:36,039 --> 01:50:48,840
Don't tell anyone. It's just for us bros. Okay. Thanks. This is 50 bucks. Don't tell anyone.

569
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:57,020
It's just for, okay. Well, I just told 5,000 people. Sorry. All right. We have to have a bench

570
01:50:57,020 --> 01:51:06,300
category. Yeah. It's over here. This is the bench for 500. Maybe you'll come out one day

571
01:51:06,300 --> 01:51:11,979
and Disney movie somebody and it'll be like, wow, he came off the bench and he sunk like five threes.

572
01:51:13,430 --> 01:51:26,890
Now is not your time. And we won the championship because of that. I have not, but 570 remaining.

573
01:51:27,689 --> 01:51:34,810
Kind of let me down, but I'll keep you there for now. Uh, where's put you back in here at number one.

574
01:51:35,369 --> 01:51:53,739
I like this guy. Oh, command. Right. Command, command girl. Let's get rid of you. Put you

575
01:51:53,739 --> 01:52:09,800
back down with the robots. We'll have two 60 normal night. Hmm. I feel like I haven't given

576
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:16,520
these big bulky robots much of a chance, but I'm not going to who's 60.

577
01:52:19,350 --> 01:52:30,739
Hmm. She was kind of good. She was all right. You need an ally though, or maybe a flyer. Yeah.

578
01:52:30,739 --> 01:52:36,039
Okay. We're going to try wind. Yeah. We didn't do wind Valkyria.

579
01:52:42,329 --> 01:53:12,920
Take multiple teams. I will. When I have 500 robots, I tweet this. Yeah. Don't forget to press

580
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:23,000
fucking X. Yeah. Well, I, I was going to get five people at the same time. Oh, it's okay.

581
01:53:24,439 --> 01:54:00,069
You can just stay way back. I now see the appeal. You can't even get over here. All right. I got,

582
01:54:00,069 --> 01:54:07,579
I don't know why I just got cocking, but in close, you're a camper. Yeah. That's the character. The

583
01:54:07,579 --> 01:54:30,789
character is a camper. Oh, all right. Let's check out this. This is the wind. What the hell does that

584
01:54:30,789 --> 01:54:55,989
do? What does that do? Does this do damage? It's just knock back bench. It's going to be a nice

585
01:54:55,989 --> 01:55:12,199
warm spot underneath you because you ain't ever going to get up from that bench.

586
01:55:14,390 --> 01:55:17,670
You're going to be sitting on that bench for so long. There's going to be an imprint of your ass

587
01:55:17,670 --> 01:55:41,930
on the metal. Command girls. Good. I'll keep command girl. And of course, a bubble bot is

588
01:55:43,979 --> 01:55:58,739
always just key. Very solid player. I'm sure there's probably somebody out there that has

589
01:55:58,739 --> 01:56:02,819
played this game before and is like, dude, he doesn't even understand that those, the flying

590
01:56:02,899 --> 01:56:07,939
Valkyries there. So you just playing wrong. They're the best characters in the game. You

591
01:56:07,939 --> 01:56:11,380
can just cheese every level. I'm sure they exist. I'm sure some three, you can do that.

592
01:56:12,020 --> 01:56:17,779
But my buddy bubble bot is going to have to take that's my playing strategy. That's my playing

593
01:56:17,779 --> 01:56:33,899
style. 87%, 88% dodge ratio. You kidding me? Bubble, but bubble, but yeah, my buddy bubble

594
01:56:33,899 --> 01:56:48,090
bot over here. Ooh, okay. We've got two. Now here we have some benching to do. Okay. That

595
01:56:48,090 --> 01:57:11,050
frees up some space. We'll put you, we'll start with you. Okay. 270. I think I want to get you

596
01:57:11,050 --> 01:57:21,899
back in here though. He's like the best character I have. Who's worth putting in for normal night?

597
01:57:34,229 --> 01:57:44,920
Put me in slot 24. I mean, guard witch could just be, I mean, it's just another character.

598
01:57:46,659 --> 01:57:50,659
When we get to guard, which we know it's time to really try as hard as we can guard, which is just

599
01:57:50,659 --> 01:58:08,659
going to die revolver gunman. Maybe, maybe one day I love revolver gunman, but you're going to

600
01:58:08,659 --> 01:58:19,369
change it up. Another GF commander. Hey, GF commander, if they got you for us, you're about

601
01:58:19,369 --> 01:58:31,640
to be destroyed. Uh, the guy with Woody. No, I want Woody though. Dude, you have to, you have

602
01:58:31,640 --> 01:58:58,300
Woody and Jax. I want those. What the fuck? Uh, Tsutomu has an airplane now. Oh, they got a,

603
01:58:58,300 --> 01:59:11,770
wait, they have a bigger airplane. I'm starting to realize why this show didn't take off.

604
01:59:16,250 --> 01:59:28,500
Wait, he, that's him. All right. This is one of my best characters.

605
01:59:36,170 --> 01:59:44,310
Got it. Keep up the pressure, keep up the pressure, keep up the pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure.

606
01:59:54,680 --> 02:00:03,979
Come on, get it. No. Okay. Good. I got to get some shots in before he gets another per, all right.

607
02:00:05,420 --> 02:00:19,479
That's a something. That's a character I haven't seen yet. Whoa. I caught him in a, well,

608
02:00:19,479 --> 02:00:39,189
almost an entire revolution. He thinks this will hit. Fucking idiot. Ooh. All right. Let's go.

609
02:00:39,189 --> 02:00:51,500
Bubble Bot. Stay away from the giant ship right now. It's on fire. You got to, where's your

610
02:00:51,500 --> 02:01:04,779
supporting fire? All right. Keep him in here. He can't get close to Bubble Bot. No way.

611
02:01:05,579 --> 02:01:38,649
He just throw me. Come on. He just had a reach. Come here, girl. Wow. Check this shit out. This

612
02:01:38,649 --> 02:01:58,779
is going to be crazy. Take out the big fucking ship. Is it Thanatos? Uh-oh. Who's left? Uh-oh.

613
02:01:58,779 --> 02:02:05,430
Time to try hard. I have to try really hard with Strawberry Shortcake. That means try.

614
02:02:06,390 --> 02:02:20,420
Strawberry Shortcake. Actually pretty good. No, we just have the big boat thing.

615
02:02:33,189 --> 02:02:44,060
Okay. Okay. Here we go. We got to, we should get this, right? Stay in the air. Come on.

616
02:02:47,369 --> 02:02:56,939
Do it. Do it. Do it. Oh, I thought that was me. Am I bad at this game? I'm not. I just won.

617
02:03:00,439 --> 02:03:10,460
I got a 62% hit ratio, a 97% dodge ratio. That's not, what, what do you want me to say?

618
02:03:11,340 --> 02:03:32,100
You got lucky. I don't know. That guy doesn't seem too serious. We didn't even get anything

619
02:03:32,100 --> 02:03:56,069
for that. Bullshit. Okay. Uh, I got, I like this team. I like this team. We need the odd number.

620
02:03:56,710 --> 02:04:11,689
I remember this Valkyrie was pretty good. In fact, we're going to put you in the front here.

621
02:04:12,409 --> 02:04:25,979
That makes more sense to me. Eh, maybe. Hmm. Okay. That's better. 1580 exact. How did I cheat?

622
02:04:26,619 --> 02:04:36,550
Did I use my superpower? Berry bubble butt or rumble. I don't know if that's going to work out.

623
02:04:37,189 --> 02:04:47,779
All right. Here we go. Battle with Sho in Yu-Gi. I'll destroy them all. I don't care if they're the

624
02:04:47,779 --> 02:05:10,170
death force or gotcha force centrist. I agree with that. All right. Do I use Reddit shelf team

625
02:05:10,170 --> 02:05:33,449
ninja heels? Really cool. Swords. What do you inject? I'm going to use Reddit shelf. What is

626
02:05:33,449 --> 02:05:46,729
that? What is that thing? Shit. I have a major, major character. I could say something right now

627
02:05:46,729 --> 02:05:52,250
that looks like that is exactly what that is. Well, I can't because I know I couldn't do that,

628
02:05:52,250 --> 02:05:57,779
but that's just, but there's an exact reference to who that is. And I, I, I can't say it

629
02:05:58,500 --> 02:06:01,539
as a, as a, I don't even want to say what it potentially could be referencing.

630
02:06:02,340 --> 02:06:23,340
All right, let's get in there. Is it slow motion field? That is slow motion field. Oh, that's

631
02:06:23,340 --> 02:06:37,750
actually cool. Cause everything's slow in here. Even projectiles. I'm so focused on this dude.

632
02:06:37,750 --> 02:07:02,140
I'm not even attacking the other guy. Weirdo. Yeah. He's so fast in that little bubble.

633
02:07:02,779 --> 02:07:12,279
We got him. We need that power. Cause I want to be able to just to span this.

634
02:07:15,460 --> 02:07:38,180
Do it. You weren't trying before. Liar. Oh shit. Okay. I can fly. Oh, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

635
02:07:38,180 --> 02:07:44,170
Up, up, up. Get away, get away, get away. We can both fly. Oh fuck. We can both fly. Oh yeah. I

636
02:07:44,170 --> 02:08:07,659
forgot this character is awesome, but I can't. Come on. God damn it. This guy's fucking insanely

637
02:08:07,659 --> 02:08:15,449
powerful. You can just float in the fucking air and rain hell. How do I get one of these things?

638
02:08:26,039 --> 02:08:46,680
Oh, this is bad. This is where you shine here. Counter, counter, counter. Get the fuck up.

639
02:08:54,460 --> 02:09:25,050
Okay. Good. Holy shit. Holy shit. Don't get cocky. Fly away. Oh my God. Is this the last thing I have?

640
02:09:25,050 --> 02:09:54,869
What's after this? I'm at the end of the world. I'm going to choke. I have to get something for

641
02:09:54,869 --> 02:10:19,189
that, right? Huh? What the fuck are you talking about, kid? That's like a phrase that he heard

642
02:10:19,189 --> 02:10:26,760
his parents say or something. And he's just, ah, I guess I'll say that. These kids are like five.

643
02:10:26,760 --> 02:10:52,739
You get nothing. What? That's bullshit. Cultural anthropology. I'm going to keep this team.

644
02:10:53,300 --> 02:11:04,699
I think it's working out. Yeah. Why change it? I'm something of a cultural anthropologist myself.

645
02:11:05,659 --> 02:11:18,359
We just keep following these. Wait, I got to save again. That was funny. That was funny.

646
02:11:18,359 --> 02:11:23,829
One of you guys is real funny. I read it. Uh, it's the same two people.

647
02:11:24,390 --> 02:11:47,220
It's like following these guys around and bullying them. You come to get beaten by me too.

648
02:11:47,220 --> 02:11:56,010
Sure. Uh, I want that's a new character. All right. Don't let me down. Don't let me down.

649
02:11:56,810 --> 02:12:09,140
Nana. Oh yeah. See? Fuck. Oh, okay. I have to, I need to tell you guys what this is. I,

650
02:12:09,140 --> 02:12:16,199
does somebody knows? Um, okay. At the end of the stream, I'm going to go into, uh,

651
02:12:16,920 --> 02:12:36,390
discord and write it somewhere. This is good. Oh, he's not even, am I going to perfect you?

652
02:12:37,699 --> 02:12:41,140
Holy shit. You're going to be, you're going to get embarrassed. I'm about to perfect this person.

653
02:12:41,779 --> 02:12:56,039
Yeah. Oh, almost. Now I'm just BMing. That's enough. That's enough mortal combat for today.

654
02:12:56,039 --> 02:13:11,189
That's enough mortal combat for today. Turn it off. Bye bye. What, where did you come from?

655
02:13:11,189 --> 02:13:27,529
Keep up the pressure in this dude's dome. Oh, this, this, I hate this dude. This guy's the worst.

656
02:13:33,180 --> 02:13:53,460
I got it. Yeah. I got to focus this dude now. Oh, not good. Get away from me.

657
02:13:55,430 --> 02:14:19,460
Oh, not good. Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad. If I have to kill this guy, I will. What falls up must come

658
02:14:19,460 --> 02:14:41,029
down. What planet are we on? Good hit. Come on. I got double teamed there. Man, you haven't healed

659
02:14:41,029 --> 02:15:04,220
me one time all game. Benched. Stop being toxic. Benched. I'm not going to use this yet. Unless I

660
02:15:04,220 --> 02:15:22,380
need to. Heal me. Heal me. Get over here and heal me now. Do you even have a healer character with

661
02:15:22,380 --> 02:15:56,539
you? I've had enough. Finally. You did it. Fuck. No. It's not over. And it won't be. What happened

662
02:15:56,539 --> 02:16:06,520
to my guy? What happened to my guy? I'm dead. I'm never using mana ever again. Mana walked around

663
02:16:06,520 --> 02:16:11,319
in circles. Didn't do anything because all she has is support characters. And then injected me

664
02:16:11,319 --> 02:16:23,670
with one heal over the whole course of the entire round. Benched. Permanently. He's right. I mean,

665
02:16:24,229 --> 02:16:35,989
the quantum theory, whatever you're talking about. I lost the opportunity. Of course,

666
02:16:35,989 --> 02:16:58,729
I picked mana for that opportunity and it's gone. Reload the save. No. He's flaming mana. Yeah, I am.

667
02:16:59,690 --> 02:17:17,420
I was holding up the earth there. I'm keeping the snow. Somebody's got to go. No, we're going to

668
02:17:17,420 --> 02:17:47,059
keep it. Beat the death eye unit. Ref, it's the eight-year-old's fault. Yes, it was. If I'm playing

669
02:17:47,059 --> 02:17:53,540
a game with children and one of the children doesn't play well, then it was the child's fault.

670
02:17:53,540 --> 02:18:06,360
I didn't do it. I have 650 points in the game of basketball we're playing. By the way, the other

671
02:18:06,360 --> 02:18:18,040
team has one. They got a safety. One of them got pushed over. No, they have zero points.

672
02:18:29,819 --> 02:19:01,850
Oh, okay. What? I kind of like this character. Where do I get one? Oh, come on. He jumped over

673
02:19:01,850 --> 02:19:15,879
it. Did they have melee? Oh, all right. I got to kill that guy now. This is horrible. They can all

674
02:19:15,879 --> 02:19:55,930
do it. Do I have to activate the superpower with this? I might. Okay. Now I remember. Now I remember.

675
02:19:55,930 --> 02:20:12,010
She has one of the best spammable super moves. X, A, X, A, X, X, A. I've got a new robot in three

676
02:20:12,010 --> 02:20:24,500
hours. I think I'm going to try my new combo I got. It's B, B, B, A, B, A, B, B, B, B, A, B.

677
02:20:34,219 --> 02:20:45,850
This is a good heavy hitter. Oh, this dude has planes. Probably you just spam attacks.

678
02:20:53,319 --> 02:21:07,670
Some of these things are so cool. I want to get satellites. You guys are so weak. Oh, man.

679
02:21:07,670 --> 02:21:24,069
They're killing it. Oh, get in there. Oh, this is bad. I think I'm gonna have to bring G force

680
02:21:24,069 --> 02:21:39,180
in here. What is the name? Is G red unless hold on. Why is that finding of Isaac? That's the Isaac

681
02:21:39,180 --> 02:22:11,879
face. Yep. Hey, I just fly above the satellite. Done. And then watch this. Goodbye. Oh, lag.

682
02:22:12,600 --> 02:22:40,149
He's so good. An emulator lag. How many satellites do you have? It's going for like a slash.

683
02:22:40,790 --> 02:23:13,219
Goodbye. Oh, why did you use it? Oh, this dude sucks. All right. Don't break with the formula

684
02:23:13,219 --> 02:23:58,340
here. Pac Man. Maybe that's why I like this guy. This sucks. I can't use the ability here.

685
02:23:58,340 --> 02:24:35,459
No. Shit. No. Get the fuck out of here. I get up. It's too laggy. I can't move. Just get the fuck

686
02:24:35,459 --> 02:25:03,420
away. Oh, shit. What do I get after this? The ninja, right? I think it's just that. I think that's it.

687
02:25:03,420 --> 02:25:22,629
Oh, my fucking God. There's another one. It's bad. It's okay. This is where we just pray.

688
02:25:24,090 --> 02:25:45,420
No, I didn't make two. Okay, we're good. No, there's no way I was. There's way too many.

689
02:25:45,420 --> 02:26:09,579
I need to bring G red here. I need like massive artillery. You get a better ship. Fuck up.

690
02:26:10,940 --> 02:26:21,059
I gotta relax. Calm down. It's all right. It's just a. All right. These are not going to happen

691
02:26:21,059 --> 02:26:26,620
for you. Sorry. You're great, but not right now. All right. We need people that can

692
02:26:27,420 --> 02:26:38,840
do damage from pretty far away. G red first. You're still fine. You're great.

693
02:26:39,799 --> 02:26:48,860
You're good. You're not so good right now. Let's get some more of the Valkyries. Who's better? Ice?

694
02:26:49,579 --> 02:27:02,379
Monado? Who does most damage? I think they both do. They all do the same damage. Will do.

695
02:27:04,379 --> 02:27:09,510
What about Spikehead? I think Spikehead. I don't know if Spikehead is going to work out.

696
02:27:10,469 --> 02:27:39,110
I'll try Spikehead and long range head. Yeah, I'm going to get one hit KO'd,

697
02:27:39,110 --> 02:27:47,430
but that's not even his name. This Spikehead is not his name. We also need somebody that we need

698
02:27:49,829 --> 02:27:55,059
artillery. Yeah. Air support, tank support, artillery, fire, big bombs. They don't move

699
02:27:55,059 --> 02:28:15,270
very slow. They're slow. I got to get the way the hell up in the air. Up, up, up all the way.

700
02:28:24,139 --> 02:28:45,639
Skybox. Good. Just avoid the beams. Not that hard. Stay all above them and just wait till I get the

701
02:28:45,639 --> 02:29:04,280
spam ability and then just light them up. He's got a plane. He's fine. I'm hitting every single one.

702
02:29:04,280 --> 02:29:12,469
They're not doing a lot of damage, but still when you can spam them, they're crazy. Almost got hit.

703
02:29:13,110 --> 02:29:32,600
Okay. Here it comes. First batch. First batch of lag spam. These are EU strats. What does that even

704
02:29:32,600 --> 02:30:00,100
mean? EU? And here we go. Good. Stay up. What the hell is that thing? Higher, higher, higher, higher,

705
02:30:00,100 --> 02:30:04,579
up, up, up, up, up. I'm blowing. Get the hell out of here. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out.

706
02:30:04,579 --> 02:30:15,659
What are you doing? Get out. Just get out. They're making the lasers, but they've moved too fast for

707
02:30:15,659 --> 02:31:02,729
me to hit. Uh-oh. There's so many of those things flying around. Hold starting engine. All right.

708
02:31:02,729 --> 02:31:17,219
Just get the fuck away while they do this bullshit. All right. Get up. Don't blow this. Come on. Up,

709
02:31:17,219 --> 02:31:21,379
go, go, go, go, up. Keep going. Keep going. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't,

710
02:31:21,379 --> 02:31:42,180
don't. Activate the VAT system. I did it. I think I was just spamming right trigger and just putting

711
02:31:42,180 --> 02:31:49,530
things everywhere. Okay. Here we go. Still have, I'm still on the Valkyrie. I was on a new character

712
02:31:49,530 --> 02:32:13,850
by now. I'll get back. Yeah. I got to stick with the formula. You'd have life break from the formula.

713
02:32:13,850 --> 02:32:30,629
I'm back into the corner. Get out. Uh-oh. Okay. It's all right. It's okay. It's okay. I got,

714
02:32:30,629 --> 02:32:43,399
I got G-Force. It's fine. He's really powerful. And in a second I can do, I can just spam the

715
02:32:43,399 --> 02:33:09,909
charge. Like for instance, right now. All right. Out. Here comes the ship. Get out. Whoa. What the

716
02:33:09,909 --> 02:33:38,760
fuck just happened? God damn. I'm still all right. I got plenty of health. Move. Is that it? Or is

717
02:33:38,760 --> 02:33:55,399
there any more satellite? Okay. This is one or two more satellites. Oh fuck. Okay. Who's next?

718
02:33:56,360 --> 02:34:02,250
It's girl. Ultra girl. Whatever her name is. Don't stand underneath them.

719
02:34:04,090 --> 02:34:44,870
All right. I got to, this is where. Run. Get away from me. Do it. Yeah. Spikehead. Good choice. No,

720
02:34:44,870 --> 02:35:03,530
uh, booger brain. Uh, bogus. What was it? Bogus something. Oh, you just did kid. Ship. I want to

721
02:35:03,530 --> 02:35:13,860
ship. Give me a ship. I just beat the guy that has ships. Uh, it's one of those satellites.

722
02:35:18,200 --> 02:35:36,309
Oh, your stupid ice cream melted. Not a bad crew. I'll keep it. I am going to go pee though.

723
02:35:36,870 --> 02:35:44,739
I'll be right back. Grab yourself a new water beverage snack. I'll be back in about two,

724
02:35:44,739 --> 02:40:00,069
three minutes. Okay. Let's keep going. I'm like addicted to this game. The hot battle

725
02:40:00,790 --> 02:40:15,530
will bring you bring saw blades, like wacky sound effects.

726
02:40:19,139 --> 02:40:38,790
No, I can't. I'm busy. I'm busy shooting, dodging that to get out a new move.

727
02:40:38,790 --> 02:40:45,420
You really are addicted. Yeah, it's fun. I wanted to, I want to have a bunch of ships and stuff.

728
02:40:47,110 --> 02:41:05,930
I want to play and have ships. That's what's important to me. The ships, he's going full

729
02:41:06,010 --> 02:41:28,709
Shatner. What does it call Shatner? Get back in the year. All right. These guys with the explosives,

730
02:41:29,350 --> 02:41:42,389
get rid of them. I've got a really itchy mouth and I don't know how to do about it.

731
02:41:42,389 --> 02:42:09,799
Here we go. God damn it. Quit exploding everything. I have had enough bookcase.

732
02:42:10,440 --> 02:42:27,829
I'm staying far away. Derma eight fiberglass again. What are you talking about? I don't know.

733
02:42:28,549 --> 02:42:56,760
Cotton candy, giant enemy dragon. I just said joke. Oh, he did the thing. This too.

734
02:43:00,760 --> 02:43:03,559
The third song, the third albums. I've been really not even as good.

735
02:43:04,440 --> 02:43:12,739
So I kind of rushed. He was just trying to get it out. Like just make a bunch of sales.

736
02:43:22,100 --> 02:43:35,559
Why is it going through? I know I missed the old Derma. You remember how just how much passion

737
02:43:36,360 --> 02:43:52,940
there was in giant enemy spider and giant enemy spider had way more nasal pushing.

738
02:43:53,500 --> 02:44:02,309
That one didn't. He just went like tiny enemy spider had like, I miss it. What happened to this

739
02:44:02,309 --> 02:44:19,110
guy? It's been a long one. Fly away. There's no reason to fight these guys up close. So they want

740
02:44:19,829 --> 02:44:46,500
Did I just hit with every auto attack? Oh God, it's embarrassing. He was with every auto attack.

741
02:44:47,139 --> 02:45:03,610
Who's the ally? Where's the out? See later. I'm going to take a bike ride. Have fun on your bike

742
02:45:03,610 --> 02:45:23,879
ride. He's been dead. Relax. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. What is it? Can I please complete one capsule

743
02:45:24,520 --> 02:45:43,639
in like eight hours of playing this game? Damn it. Kneel before me. You're cool, but I want

744
02:45:44,360 --> 02:45:52,659
I want this guy back. You're good too, but I want to bring in some you. Okay, nice. And I want you

745
02:45:52,659 --> 02:45:56,600
here. I want you at the very end just to get something happens. And I want you first.

746
02:46:01,979 --> 02:46:11,500
Back in 10 minutes. I'm going to watch beef house. Here you go. Fresh trash. What's in here? Fresh

747
02:46:11,500 --> 02:46:37,129
beef. Try. I've seen a few episodes. Here we go. Do my chores. Get them done. Good. Don't leave

748
02:46:37,129 --> 02:46:54,459
streaks on the windows. It's a while for them to come off if you do. Hey, oh shit. It's a, it's me.

749
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:12,149
See who the better me is. It's me. What was that? What the hell was that? That was weird.

750
02:47:16,860 --> 02:47:24,729
Oh, it's a copy. It's a copier. That's really useful if you can get one of these.

751
02:47:42,709 --> 02:47:56,469
How many more enemies are here? Look at that bar. I'm not going to use it with her. I got a,

752
02:47:56,549 --> 02:48:13,459
I got, got you, got you, man. Whatever. Later. Don't tell him. Tell me what? Now tell me.

753
02:48:13,459 --> 02:48:28,500
I want to know. What? Yeah, I know I don't. I'm focused on playing this super fun game cube

754
02:48:28,500 --> 02:48:51,799
experience. Okay. Please tell me what it is. Please tell me what it is. Please tell me what it is.

755
02:48:51,799 --> 02:49:05,860
Google it. I don't know what I'm supposed to Googling. Tell me what it is. Tell me what it is.

756
02:49:05,860 --> 02:49:34,840
Google it. Google what? Google it. It's already too late. Oh, fine. Let me out of this, please.

757
02:49:42,059 --> 02:49:53,979
Who's the person that turns you into the newts? This character is so good. Just,

758
02:49:53,979 --> 02:50:00,860
he's just so consistent. He's very consistent. Slow. He has one good move, but he's consistent.

759
02:50:05,579 --> 02:50:35,559
Now we press the button. See ya. Who's left? Oh, one guy. Oh, this was the audio muted or something.

760
02:50:36,979 --> 02:50:48,950
I don't think it is. All right. Tell me, tell me what it is. Or I just go to random.org. Pick

761
02:50:48,950 --> 02:50:52,870
a random number and every five seconds ban somebody permanently from the channel until

762
02:50:52,870 --> 02:51:13,270
you tell me. Do it. Wait. We got a new robot. All right. How fast do you think I can drink this water?

763
02:51:33,979 --> 02:51:37,959
See? It's terrible, but he doesn't, he doesn't need to be good.

764
02:51:39,129 --> 02:51:46,649
Copy. He was going to explore planets. He duplicates his opponents and fights with them,

765
02:51:47,290 --> 02:52:07,770
fights them with their own power. Very expensive. Let's try a copy, man. Now I can be a satellite.

766
02:52:07,770 --> 02:52:19,979
Yeah, that's true. Does that work? Copy the giant ship. Showdown. No, that's, that's force unit.

767
02:52:20,860 --> 02:52:34,500
Battle with, all right. Let's do this one. Showdown. This team's not very good, but wait,

768
02:52:34,500 --> 02:52:40,120
I can copy their best hero. Who's the strongest one? Right in the middle. All right. Copy.

769
02:52:41,700 --> 02:52:50,600
Copy right in the middle. Let's go. Wait, you have to throw your, you actually have to hit them.

770
02:52:59,139 --> 02:53:17,299
Give me, give me somebody. Oh, this ain't going to work out. Hey, look at me. It'd be great if you

771
02:53:17,299 --> 02:53:24,200
could actually, if you're not fighting five people at the same time, it works. Okay. Sniper girl.

772
02:53:24,920 --> 02:53:39,799
Gonna work out. Oh, I just got caught in the air. That was bad. I can just get one of you. Just die.

773
02:53:42,379 --> 02:54:00,120
Fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly. Oh, yeah. We, this is not bad. As long as I kill one.

774
02:54:00,760 --> 02:54:26,659
Okay. Keep going. That was holy shit. I'm going to get to stop. It's just you, right?

775
02:54:26,659 --> 02:54:35,239
All right. Just the big guy. I try to jump over it. Shit. It's okay. Who's left? Oh, it's over.

776
02:54:36,040 --> 02:55:03,139
I win. Well, now you're little. Sorry. All your power is gone. Who's the real cheater here?

777
02:55:03,700 --> 02:55:13,430
When are you going to do another Hearthstone stream? That was a pog face.

778
02:55:16,540 --> 02:55:25,590
Um, that's not going to happen. All right. Give me an, finally capsule. Let's go complete a capsule.

779
02:55:26,389 --> 02:55:40,059
Do I have one of the one of these? I have so many singles. God damn it. It's like playing the

780
02:55:40,059 --> 02:56:03,260
Monopoly game of McDonald's. Give me a break. I'm never going to win. He's got five community subs

781
02:56:03,260 --> 02:56:11,000
from West Yule. Thank you West Yule. Appreciate the five subs. Now one of these little guys.

782
02:56:12,600 --> 02:56:16,840
Welcome. Thanks for the subs. Welcome all the new subs and welcome all the new mods.

783
02:56:19,340 --> 02:56:40,790
New mods. Please say hello. Uh, this way. How do I punchy cookie? I don't know. I missed it. Big boy.

784
02:56:42,739 --> 02:56:48,819
I need a new trailer. Can I copy the big guy? Right. I should be able to copy this guy, right?

785
02:56:49,620 --> 02:57:06,200
Can I copy anything in the game? Whoa. This is cool. It only has one move. This is a bad thing

786
02:57:06,200 --> 02:57:20,709
to copy. This thing's terrible. Copy that guy. Wait, should I copy? You're even worse. Wait,

787
02:57:20,709 --> 02:57:35,979
what is this? Oh, he's cool. I like this guy with the, with the two hands. It's actually fun.

788
02:57:46,260 --> 02:58:00,940
No, it's all right. No, I like this game so much. Whoa. How can you like this so much? What's going

789
02:58:00,940 --> 02:58:09,079
on here? Um, I just love projectiles. I love projectiles with travel time. It's my favorite

790
02:58:09,079 --> 02:58:26,620
thing in any game, especially a third person of first person game. Reminds me. The hell am I

791
02:58:26,620 --> 02:58:38,139
going to play tribes? What are we going to play tribes? Is the server still on? The game was so

792
02:58:38,139 --> 02:58:55,239
much fun. We had five more community subs from Saarbruss. Thank you Saarbruss for dropping those

793
02:58:55,239 --> 02:59:08,840
subs. Appreciate it. I just hit every auto attack. That's so good. First and third are the only two

794
02:59:08,840 --> 02:59:33,879
options, right? Um, yeah. Well, 2D, right? Like side scroller. What am I thinking of? Bird's eye.

795
02:59:33,879 --> 02:59:42,329
Yeah. Bird's eye side scrolling, but the projectiles have to travel and have to be able to travel with

796
02:59:42,329 --> 02:59:49,799
in real physics. I wish I could copy that guy. How do I get that guy? The double R. We'll get

797
02:59:49,799 --> 02:59:54,040
those two bowling balls. Oh my goodness. Please give me this guy at the end of this.

798
02:59:55,260 --> 03:00:01,819
That's, that's just the shield. Uh, bubble butt guy, except way cooler. He just has two.

799
03:00:02,379 --> 03:00:18,170
I want this guy. Please give it to me. I want to play tribes again. The best part about tribes

800
03:00:18,170 --> 03:00:24,250
was when you hit that blue plate special and you were just 7 million years away and you would just

801
03:00:24,250 --> 03:00:44,940
go up in the air and you'd go like, it's like, Holy, I killed that guy. This whole thing with

802
03:00:47,420 --> 03:01:03,670
girl commander blue plate special was the best. And the soldier had that arcing grenade launcher.

803
03:01:04,309 --> 03:01:10,170
That game was so much fun. Do they make games like that anymore? Is there a game that

804
03:01:11,129 --> 03:01:15,750
think of what I feel about tribes ascend? I want a game that is that.

805
03:01:17,260 --> 03:01:29,100
No, no. Well, and we didn't get anything from that last experience.

806
03:01:29,819 --> 03:01:35,670
I'm going to change this up a bit. I like, I remember I was using a negative,

807
03:01:36,469 --> 03:01:49,799
put negative back in here. Tribes of school, but never got updated. I think,

808
03:01:49,799 --> 03:01:52,840
but wasn't the problem with tribes that it got updated, but they put a bunch of

809
03:01:52,840 --> 03:02:14,549
weird dumb shit in the game that nobody wanted on robots, putting hitscan and tribes.

810
03:02:16,120 --> 03:02:21,770
Well, where's the, where's the true hitscan in tribes? What are the machine guns?

811
03:02:22,489 --> 03:02:26,620
But weren't the machine guns even projectiles? You had to still land them.

812
03:02:34,500 --> 03:02:52,520
Sniper was hitscan really dumb. I think it was, you know, I bet you there was this an

813
03:02:52,520 --> 03:02:55,399
appetite for something like that. Like a real revival of that kind of game.

814
03:03:02,090 --> 03:03:12,760
This all projectile based satisfying shots. No, there isn't. Yeah. But this, I'm telling you,

815
03:03:12,760 --> 03:03:19,270
this shit comes in cycles, man. Everyone, every single person was making a MOBA. Everyone.

816
03:03:20,780 --> 03:03:26,219
Like if you, if you were a game company and you did not have a like top-down MOBA in development,

817
03:03:27,100 --> 03:03:31,989
what the fuck were you doing with your life? That's now become BR.

818
03:03:32,629 --> 03:03:47,610
Did that thing explode? Oh, I'm going to copy this guy. BR is currently like the trend right now.

819
03:03:47,610 --> 03:03:51,209
It's really popular, but it's, it's going to, it's not going to be there forever.

820
03:03:52,170 --> 03:03:56,229
When's like the tribes ascend game going to be the, you know, that's what I'm looking for.

821
03:04:03,579 --> 03:04:10,100
There we go. No, I don't want this guy. This guy sucks. It's going to be in 50 years.

822
03:04:10,739 --> 03:04:34,229
I don't think so. Oh fuck. I want to turn into this guy. Shit. Ooh, I got it. Okay. What is,

823
03:04:34,229 --> 03:04:41,909
what is this thing? He has like pulsating shots. Oh, I'd love to see what the fuck was going on.

824
03:04:45,450 --> 03:04:51,370
Wait, was he about to do the bigger they are, the harder they fall in the same tone.

825
03:04:52,739 --> 03:05:13,530
Why didn't we get to hear that? We all, we were almost there. The bigger they are,

826
03:05:13,530 --> 03:05:20,870
the harder they fall. I'm just trying to snipe this guy out. It needs to be working.

827
03:05:22,149 --> 03:05:54,229
Let's use it. Jump. Jump. Oh, that was a cool hero. Too bad. There he is again.

828
03:05:54,229 --> 03:06:08,459
It's probably going to be that weird bubble guy. Another thunder robot. Are you shitting me?

829
03:06:16,709 --> 03:06:36,409
Fucking thunder robot. Are you shitting me? Under the warehouse. What does that mean?

830
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:50,360
I'm going to know too weird, too much setup time, too much setup time, too expensive.

831
03:06:51,719 --> 03:07:05,260
There's my boy right there. Nevermind. Sit back down. Melting them down. Wait,

832
03:07:07,590 --> 03:07:19,370
hold on. I changed my mind. This is ship level. I'm going to turn into a huge ship or a satellite

833
03:07:19,370 --> 03:07:27,700
or something. Oh, but in the meantime, you know, I'm going back to, uh, I haven't played with these

834
03:07:27,700 --> 03:07:54,520
guys in a long time. 250 and then 150. Wait, save it. Do an angry video game nerd impression.

835
03:07:56,840 --> 03:08:10,579
Um, uh, the problem is it's just donkey shit. It's like the smelliest donkey shit you've ever seen

836
03:08:11,219 --> 03:08:20,059
in your entire life. Now, look at this guy. This guy just sucks. This game sucks. Is that right?

837
03:08:20,059 --> 03:08:33,750
That's pretty good. That was all right. Hey guys, fun, uh, fun thing about the angry video game

838
03:08:33,750 --> 03:08:49,590
nerd. Uh, you know, he's like the D and D of YouTubers. You know that, right? He was doing

839
03:08:49,590 --> 03:08:57,110
that shit fucking like 20 years ago. Like the Witcher three is a great game, but like it's D

840
03:08:57,110 --> 03:09:14,579
and D is the reason why like the Witcher three even exists. Whoa. Look at that. What? Come on.

841
03:09:15,459 --> 03:09:23,540
I can't do this. Oh, that's, that's not cool. I got to play as one of these

842
03:09:23,540 --> 03:09:39,270
eye of kill rocks. Oh, that's great. Might as well. I can't even fly. Well, you know what to do.

843
03:09:45,989 --> 03:09:57,559
Oh, look at all those blue plate specials. Actually pretty good character to be here.

844
03:09:58,520 --> 03:10:32,379
Everyone was like, he's up. What do you have to say now? Oh, extra super powerful. What does it

845
03:10:32,379 --> 03:10:38,170
look like? Um, does it look like it looks like, uh, like a mega man shot? No, what does it look

846
03:10:38,170 --> 03:10:57,879
like? It looks like something from a game. He did a lot of work. We get just how much health that

847
03:10:57,879 --> 03:11:06,389
just brought the G F down buster shots from mega man legends. It kind of does. Yeah. And this is a

848
03:11:06,389 --> 03:11:13,260
Capcom game. You guys didn't know this game is Capcom. It's made by the same people that made

849
03:11:14,219 --> 03:11:42,440
resident evil seven. It's not Capcom. It is. That's my best score yet. I think. Yes. Finally,

850
03:11:42,440 --> 03:11:48,549
a fucking plane. Yeah. They also made resident evil six. Now that they outsourced that that was

851
03:11:48,549 --> 03:11:56,139
made by Capcom. Hey, you guys know, I like aliens, colonial Marines. I like hat. Like the game

852
03:11:56,139 --> 03:12:15,450
wouldn't even made by gearbox. You've got a death crystal. Looks like some kind of key data. Blue

853
03:12:15,450 --> 03:12:25,139
striker. Fastest thing in the game. No attack. How missile Vulcan power beam. I had to type

854
03:12:25,139 --> 03:12:34,840
Eric Borg who fought during the interplanetary mega Borg war. He can move freely in the sky and

855
03:12:34,840 --> 03:12:47,049
possesses missiles Vulcans and a deadly power beam. Not expensive either. Lead with that.

856
03:12:47,049 --> 03:13:06,889
I'll keep you here for a while. 390 remain 180. I got six people now. Cool.

857
03:13:16,219 --> 03:13:24,420
He's no good at the boundaries. No, not really. Mysterious crystal. Ooh, here comes lower.

858
03:13:25,299 --> 03:13:29,430
I got some strange data. Watch out at the death force.

859
03:13:29,989 --> 03:13:52,920
Look at that. Here we go. Plane time. Whoa. Cool. I can't. How do I? Wait, you can hold

860
03:14:00,149 --> 03:14:22,819
missiles. Wow. What's the charge do? Wally. Ooh, dodge. One of those land. Oh, that was fun though.

861
03:14:30,680 --> 03:14:38,600
They had some good anti-air. That's the reason why it happened. We both have this. This is cool.

862
03:14:39,239 --> 03:15:07,590
Don't think so. Watch this shit. Who's quad ninjaed this person? Get it. You're too fast.

863
03:15:08,229 --> 03:15:35,540
All right. Back it up. I hear a dragon. I do. You already killed my buddy. Nice shot.

864
03:15:36,100 --> 03:16:06,920
You got it. Come on. You got to give credit. Who else is here? Shit. No, that wasn't even

865
03:16:08,010 --> 03:16:43,780
that. What are the 3000 GF power? Holy shit. Okay. Don't. Okay. We got sniper. This is a boss

866
03:16:43,780 --> 03:17:09,959
battle. I didn't say it was. I don't think it is. Save that power though. Got me too. Holy fuck.

867
03:17:09,959 --> 03:17:18,489
He's still playing this. That long. I mean, I know my streams turned into like four or five hours

868
03:17:18,489 --> 03:17:31,530
long, but I mean, it's not like that. It's not like that long. Somebody said this is Warframe,

869
03:17:32,329 --> 03:18:00,600
but imagine if it was a cartoon like this and I would like that. It really isn't. Another dragon.

870
03:18:07,540 --> 03:18:21,530
Risky, but worth it. Copy the dragon, please. I don't have the copy guy right now.

871
03:18:22,649 --> 03:18:40,120
Is he even on the team? Turn it on. No, he's not.

872
03:18:50,469 --> 03:19:01,079
I look over and you guys are fucking crazy. Shit. I like the plane, but it's very vulnerable.

873
03:19:01,879 --> 03:19:10,139
You have to really fly the hell out of there. Why are you a girl?

874
03:19:16,739 --> 03:19:21,219
Are you looking for this? Got a death crystal. How many death crystals do I need?

875
03:19:22,819 --> 03:19:39,450
I've got two. I've got two death crystals. Hey, look. I mean, she looks cool.

876
03:19:40,409 --> 03:19:46,920
D though. Charge gun, beam knife, charge beam, anchor wire. Fire girl was trained on a secret

877
03:19:46,920 --> 03:19:54,389
agent. Once her anchor wire is set, she can return to a set point at any time. Very useful when she

878
03:19:54,389 --> 03:19:59,430
needs to make a sharp exit. That's really good. It's like teleporting, but better. That's right.

879
03:20:02,940 --> 03:20:23,750
320. That's pretty good. All right. Here we go. Death commander. Who should I bring? All right,

880
03:20:23,750 --> 03:20:47,620
Manny. You get one more shot off the bench. Let's go. Fly away. Are they homing? I can't hit.

881
03:20:47,620 --> 03:20:55,750
Okay. I just hit myself with my own missile. That's not even possible. No, your ship is so

882
03:20:55,750 --> 03:21:19,909
much better than mine. Bombing run. Okay. Anchor point. How does this work? How does this work?

883
03:21:35,659 --> 03:21:49,059
You can go back to any point? I don't understand. Wait a minute. Okay. You have to fly. You fly

884
03:21:49,059 --> 03:21:54,739
near it. Wait a second. Hold on. Okay. Now I've just first time ever used this character.

885
03:21:54,739 --> 03:22:15,450
How did I? Oh, I got hit by the, I think I got hit by it. Oh, this one sucks. There's too many

886
03:22:15,450 --> 03:22:25,079
of them. Oh, I sure would love to be healed by the best character in the game. I have a support

887
03:22:25,079 --> 03:22:33,370
character that doesn't do anything. Spends all the time walking around in circles and missing me.

888
03:22:34,170 --> 03:22:50,809
Okay. Heal me now. Get over here. On earth are you? Come here. Heal me. Heal me. You don't have any

889
03:22:50,809 --> 03:23:15,219
other. Finally. That character doesn't even have any fucking moves. You're going to heal me or

890
03:23:15,219 --> 03:23:47,430
what? When you say here, that's something that somebody on the bench would say. Kill it. Kill it.

891
03:23:47,430 --> 03:24:19,059
That's it. Now you're in big trouble. Now you're in trouble. Oh, excuse me. You got to heal for me?

892
03:24:19,059 --> 03:24:30,010
Oh shit. It's a nuke. Shoot it. Manna run. Manna. Manna. Manna. Manna. Thank God.

893
03:24:30,010 --> 03:25:02,920
Tactical nuke. Hope I get one right here. Ooh. Yeah. That has to. That's going into the crew.

894
03:25:06,020 --> 03:25:11,700
You're useless Tamma. I gave you the power of the death arc, but you still lost.

895
03:25:12,340 --> 03:25:23,459
What are you talking about? Death arc was not strong enough. Where's that? There it is.

896
03:25:23,459 --> 03:25:37,639
350. That's pretty solid. Bug Borg. Insect bomb. Insect slicer. Insect scope. Mech life form from

897
03:25:37,639 --> 03:25:42,680
outer space. Its gate shield protects it from enemy attacks while its right arm is sharp as a blade.

898
03:25:43,319 --> 03:25:54,440
Its insect scope reduces the power of enemy shots. D-Buff. You can keep Wire Girl on here too.

899
03:25:55,940 --> 03:26:12,940
Uh. Okay. The shame the toys never happened. The designs in the game kick ass.

900
03:26:13,659 --> 03:26:20,040
I mean, they're pretty, they are pretty good. They're pretty cool.

901
03:26:20,680 --> 03:26:40,680
I would have loved to play with these things. Funded. What is there to fund?

902
03:26:41,479 --> 03:26:49,659
Weren't you like 20 when this came out? Well, I mean, I was, yeah, I was like,

903
03:26:50,219 --> 03:26:57,340
no, I was like fucking 19, 18 or something. 17. That's besides the point. I'm talking about

904
03:26:57,340 --> 03:27:01,579
if I was like younger and played this when I was like 10. That would have been sick.

905
03:27:06,809 --> 03:27:25,350
Charge dude. This is a huge one. Okay. I just found. Nice. It's so good. All right. Don't crash.

906
03:27:25,350 --> 03:27:44,440
All right. Missiles. Damn, this thing is actually really good. Can you imagine flying around like

907
03:27:44,440 --> 03:27:52,229
this when you were 10? You would, you would shit your pants if you played this when you were like

908
03:27:52,229 --> 03:28:33,770
12. Look at those thick, thick beams. Retreat. Can't dodge that. Oh, it's all right. A lot of

909
03:28:33,770 --> 03:28:48,780
good. Okay. Here we go. Bug, the bug guy. Oh shit. That's he's got recharge, huh? Did I do it?

910
03:28:54,969 --> 03:29:10,260
I'm kind of hard to tell what's going on here. He doesn't suck. I just, I don't understand yet.

911
03:29:12,090 --> 03:29:28,709
It's like fields that he's shooting out. It's a debuff field, right?

912
03:29:31,299 --> 03:29:45,799
All right. I still don't understand how this works. I'm trying to get this to activate somehow.

913
03:29:46,600 --> 03:29:55,459
X doesn't do it. I feel like touch them. Double tap X. Okay. That makes sense.

914
03:29:59,770 --> 03:30:17,370
Just mash buttons. Okay. That's good. Let's put them across the whole map. Yeah. This is gonna be

915
03:30:17,370 --> 03:30:35,219
great. Ready? The game broke. It would have been cool. Did she have a melee? Yeah. And it's pretty

916
03:30:35,219 --> 03:30:52,469
good. It's quick. Back up. I think that's just a really good character. That's the reason why

917
03:30:52,469 --> 03:31:00,219
my bug guy was just not fair. This guy's a limited edition. Bug guys are common. He's like a D or

918
03:31:00,219 --> 03:31:16,459
something. This guy's probably like an S. I won the record for oldest person to play this game.

919
03:31:17,180 --> 03:31:29,979
That's fine. That doesn't embarrass me. Why are that? Oh, this game is cool. It's a really neat

920
03:31:29,979 --> 03:31:38,120
game. And I'm, I want to showcase this showcase Saturday. We're checking out this old showcaseable

921
03:31:38,120 --> 03:31:45,379
game. That's really fun. And really, I wish they'd make games like this again. Look at this showcase.

922
03:31:46,100 --> 03:31:54,440
No, it's not. It's Tuesday. It's Tuesday. It's Tuesday. I guess I have any, you guys still don't

923
03:31:54,440 --> 03:32:02,360
understand how time zones work. Can you imagine if the earth was like 50 times larger than it is?

924
03:32:03,860 --> 03:32:23,500
And it could be like Thursday for you. And it's like Monday for me. You'd be stuck in a time loop.

925
03:32:23,500 --> 03:32:32,569
Days would just be longer. But would we have longer days? Would a day be like 75? Like what?

926
03:32:32,569 --> 03:32:41,829
One day would be like a week. If the earth was a hundred times bigger than it is now,

927
03:32:44,409 --> 03:33:00,620
what we might have, we might rotate slower. Thank God I got one. He's learning. Gravity would kill

928
03:33:00,620 --> 03:33:12,389
us. The earth was okay. If the earth was like, okay, if, if, if how long it takes for you to get

929
03:33:13,110 --> 03:33:19,510
from like, let's say like New York to London, right? Was it like a eight hour flight,

930
03:33:19,510 --> 03:33:23,989
11 hour flight? Imagine you should, okay. So if you want to go from like a New York to London,

931
03:33:24,870 --> 03:33:35,100
it was like four days in an airplane. Like the ocean was 50 times larger. What would happen?

932
03:33:35,100 --> 03:33:44,620
The earth is still the earth. Like we, we have the same amount of countries in the same places,

933
03:33:44,620 --> 03:33:51,829
but it's, but like, there's just way more ocean. Is the mass still the same? Yeah. Like the mass

934
03:33:51,829 --> 03:34:06,440
of the countries is the same, but the ocean is like six million times bigger. Do I have to draw

935
03:34:06,440 --> 03:34:14,659
this? I might have to draw this for you. Do I have to draw this? I don't think people understand

936
03:34:14,659 --> 03:34:38,819
what I'm saying here. Hold on. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. This is important. So this is what I'm

937
03:34:38,819 --> 03:35:00,659
talking about. If you clean for you so you can see it nice and good, but it's what you paint.

938
03:35:00,659 --> 03:35:04,180
You have to course it is. Well, who cares? Look, I'm going to make, I'm going to fix it. I'll fix

939
03:35:04,180 --> 03:35:09,700
it here. Now your eyes won't hurt. Okay. I got to get this music out of my ears. It's going to

940
03:35:09,700 --> 03:35:14,979
fucking make me scream. Okay. So here's earth. I'm going to draw you earth. Here's the earth as,

941
03:35:14,979 --> 03:35:26,409
as it is now. Right? So this is earth. And then like here's, uh, this is Africa. This is like

942
03:35:26,409 --> 03:35:36,809
North America. Uh, this is, uh, this is Europe, right? Italy. And then over here is like on the

943
03:35:36,809 --> 03:35:41,850
other side, I can't draw it. It's like, you know, China and Russia and stuff. Okay. Under here is

944
03:35:41,850 --> 03:35:44,889
South America. Remember it's, I'm just, this is, you just know where it is. All right. So this is

945
03:35:44,889 --> 03:35:52,379
what the earth looks like now. So what happens? And here's the sun, right? So here's the sun.

946
03:35:53,260 --> 03:36:00,540
Obviously the, now the earth is spinning like this, right? Spin, spin, spin. Here's the sun.

947
03:36:02,100 --> 03:36:08,549
Sun also goes like in a circle or something. I don't know. It's going to be a sad planet.

948
03:36:11,079 --> 03:36:15,239
No, we go in a circle. We go in a circle. We, that's where the circle is. So we circle like

949
03:36:15,239 --> 03:36:25,079
this. What? Give me different colors. I don't want fucking puke orange. What the, stop. What

950
03:36:25,079 --> 03:36:35,500
the fuck? All right. So we're going like this, but we're also going like this. So what happens

951
03:36:35,500 --> 03:36:41,049
in this scenario? How do I, something's wrong with my computer. There's something, something has to

952
03:36:41,049 --> 03:36:55,350
be wrong with my computer. That doesn't make any sense. Um, something has to be something wrong

953
03:36:55,350 --> 03:37:10,700
with the computer. Is that eraser? I'm going to try to do this as detailed as I can. Okay. I'm sorry.

954
03:37:10,700 --> 03:37:22,329
I'll fix it. So what happens when you have the earth like this? So here's the earth. That's the

955
03:37:22,329 --> 03:37:37,129
earth. Here's the sun right here. And now here is, here's North America. Here is South America.

956
03:37:41,930 --> 03:37:56,250
Here's Africa. Here's Europe. And then on the other side is right. Where's Mexico?

957
03:37:56,250 --> 03:38:03,930
Down here. You know what I'm saying? So what happens? We're rotating like this and we're

958
03:38:03,930 --> 03:38:11,899
also going like this. What have, if the earth is like 60 times bigger, wait, would we not have any

959
03:38:11,899 --> 03:38:21,239
sunlight? Would it just be, okay. Would there only be sunlight like here? Only. Like in one country.

960
03:38:25,659 --> 03:38:32,579
If the sun was like tiny, would it be like a flashlight on one country at a time? And would

961
03:38:32,579 --> 03:38:37,139
everybody else be in pitch black until it finally like moved a little bit and like, and finally,

962
03:38:37,139 --> 03:38:45,139
okay. Now this right here, this part can get some sunlight. That's not how light works.

963
03:38:45,780 --> 03:38:52,440
But would it just be darker? Would you, would it just, would it be darker outside? Would we

964
03:38:52,440 --> 03:39:12,520
wouldn't have big sunshine? It would just be darker. It'd be harsh shadows. So what if all

965
03:39:12,520 --> 03:39:17,719
the countries are like this in the same spot over here? Like typically like this is like where earth

966
03:39:17,719 --> 03:39:22,760
is now, right? Imagine this is earth and there's the countries. Imagine they all were in there.

967
03:39:23,719 --> 03:39:40,219
Would we have like a day of sunlight and then like 12 days of darkness? Yes, we would. Big earth

968
03:39:40,219 --> 03:39:48,260
theory. That's not how days work. But like our perception of darkness would be longer. It would

969
03:39:48,260 --> 03:39:55,620
be long. It would be darker for longer. Like it would be like, holy shit, it's dark for so fucking

970
03:39:55,620 --> 03:40:05,989
long. Even though it's, you know, yeah. It's like this when you play Minecraft. I'm of the opinion

971
03:40:05,989 --> 03:40:10,629
that in Minecraft the nights are longer and it's been coded that way. I've been told it's not true,

972
03:40:10,629 --> 03:40:29,450
but it is. Includes my what if the earth was big theory. Oh, you know, there's some science

973
03:40:29,450 --> 03:40:33,049
channel that's made a video about what if the earth was fucking a thousand times bigger.

974
03:40:34,090 --> 03:40:37,190
Don't act like I'm some kind of psycho.

975
03:41:25,350 --> 03:41:29,829
Hey, just who cares how bad you spell? Just spam your keyboard and then the computer will fix it

976
03:41:29,829 --> 03:41:37,979
for you. Just mash keys. You can do this with your shit bed drunk. Hey there, welcome to life.

977
03:41:38,459 --> 03:41:43,979
We live in a part of the solar system called the Goldilocks zone. It's not too hot that all the

978
03:41:43,979 --> 03:41:49,260
water evaporates away, but it's also not too cold where it freezes instead. And unless you're an

979
03:41:49,260 --> 03:41:55,020
astronaut, the big spherical rock will be your home for life. But what if that home suddenly

980
03:41:55,020 --> 03:42:00,059
changed? What if in a split second, the earth doubled in size? Let's just write the density

981
03:42:00,059 --> 03:42:05,180
remains constant. So the mass of the earth increased as well. How would that change things?

982
03:42:05,180 --> 03:42:10,459
Well, first off, gravity would be very different. The earth would have eight times as much mass and

983
03:42:10,459 --> 03:42:17,180
gravity would be twice as strong. So if you suddenly weigh twice as much, I said 10 times

984
03:42:17,180 --> 03:42:23,739
much harder for you to walk and you'd get tired much more on the ground. Another version of yourself,

985
03:42:23,739 --> 03:42:29,899
a piggyback ride all day, every day, which would look very funny. Over the years, human bones,

986
03:42:29,899 --> 03:42:34,379
especially in the legs, would have to become stronger to support this increased weight.

987
03:42:34,379 --> 03:42:39,819
Meanwhile, trees would start to collapse and any new trees that grow in their place might not grow

988
03:42:39,819 --> 03:42:46,059
as tall. See, there's a limit for how tall a tree can grow, usually around 400 feet or so. This limit

989
03:42:46,059 --> 03:42:50,940
is determined by gravity. Since the taller the tree is, the more energy is required to transport

990
03:42:50,940 --> 03:42:55,659
water from the roots to the top. If the amount of energy the tree gains from photosynthesis is

991
03:42:55,659 --> 03:43:00,700
more than the energy it takes to transport the water, it'll keep growing. Otherwise, it'll stop.

992
03:43:00,700 --> 03:43:07,180
So if the earth suddenly got twice as big, trees like the California redwood may not be as impressive.

993
03:43:07,180 --> 03:43:11,020
Luckily, even though the gravitational pull of the earth will be stronger, it still won't be

994
03:43:11,020 --> 03:43:16,059
enough to break the moon apart. See, in order for that to happen, the moon would have to be within

995
03:43:16,059 --> 03:43:20,540
the earth's Roche limit. This is the minimum distance the moon can approach the earth without

996
03:43:20,540 --> 03:43:25,739
being torn apart by tidal forces. This happens because the near side of the moon is pulled in

997
03:43:25,739 --> 03:43:30,379
harder than the far side. When the moon gets close enough to the earth, the gravity holding it together

998
03:43:30,379 --> 03:43:36,059
is overcome by this cosmic tug. Inside that limit, earth's gravity will tear the moon apart, giving

999
03:43:36,059 --> 03:43:42,459
us a ring like those around Saturn. And the more earth there is, the more it will heat up. See,

1000
03:43:42,459 --> 03:43:47,739
if there are more unstable elements in the crust and interior, more heat will reach the surface and

1001
03:43:47,739 --> 03:43:52,139
there may be much more volcanic activity. And I don't know about you, but I'd rather not live

1002
03:43:52,139 --> 03:43:56,620
in a world where there's a constant threat of an exploding volcano. Oh, wait, are we already living

1003
03:43:56,620 --> 03:44:01,819
in that? I'm looking at you, Yellowstone. Anyway, if you could live anywhere in the universe,

1004
03:44:01,819 --> 03:44:07,100
no limitations. Where would it be and why? If I could, I'd totally live in Jupiter's great red

1005
03:44:07,100 --> 03:44:19,540
spot. It'd be pretty dangerous. All right. That doesn't answer my question. What happens to the

1006
03:44:19,540 --> 03:44:44,680
sun? What happens to our sun? We live in strange times. For 200 years now, starting with Thomas

1007
03:44:44,680 --> 03:44:49,959
Robert Malthus, demographers have been sounding the alarm that there isn't enough space and

1008
03:44:49,959 --> 03:44:56,120
resources on earth and that there's an oversupply of people. Don't we the ocean? The earth belonged

1009
03:44:56,120 --> 03:45:03,399
to the class of planets called super earths and had a mass and size two or even 10 times larger.

1010
03:45:03,479 --> 03:45:10,520
Would it solve all of our problems? Or on the contrary, would terrible consequences await us?

1011
03:45:12,520 --> 03:45:17,239
According to the assumptions of Mickey Rosenthal from the University of California,

1012
03:45:17,239 --> 03:45:23,799
Santa Cruz, our planet had every chance of becoming a super earth, but this was prevented

1013
03:45:23,799 --> 03:45:30,040
by Jupiter, which blocked the earth's access to additional building material that could have made

1014
03:45:30,040 --> 03:45:35,639
it much larger. If it weren't for Jupiter, the earth would have grown and almost everything on

1015
03:45:35,639 --> 03:45:42,360
our planet would have shrunk several times over. And this is not a matter of proportions at all,

1016
03:45:42,360 --> 03:45:49,319
but one of enhanced gravity to over increase to a hundred and on a super earth with double

1017
03:45:49,319 --> 03:45:58,600
earth's mass, your weight would increase to 150 kilograms or 330 pounds and up to 750 kilograms

1018
03:45:58,600 --> 03:46:06,920
or 1650 pounds is almost 10 times greater than the was close to that of Kepler 20 B

1019
03:46:07,559 --> 03:46:14,280
with part of the core. This means that the magnetic field protecting us from solar wind could

1020
03:46:14,280 --> 03:46:22,040
disappear and the sun, anyone who survived the frequent meteor showers would wait here in such

1021
03:46:22,040 --> 03:46:28,120
water due to the high pressure. The ocean floor would be covered with a thick layer of ice,

1022
03:46:28,200 --> 03:46:33,879
which would make the carbon cycle and yeah, we would die between the atmosphere and the bowels

1023
03:46:33,879 --> 03:46:40,520
of the planet impossible. In fact, according to Hilkey Schlichting from the University of

1024
03:46:40,520 --> 03:46:47,559
California, Los Angeles, if our planet was a super earth, all the water would simply evaporate.

1025
03:46:47,559 --> 03:46:53,879
According to her assumption, the earth would rotate much closer to the sun in orbit,

1026
03:46:53,879 --> 03:47:01,879
making a complete revolution in only 100 days. Orbit is considered habitable if the star is

1027
03:47:01,879 --> 03:47:08,440
smaller than our son, but at such a distance from our son, all the water on a super earth

1028
03:47:08,440 --> 03:47:15,399
would simply evaporate. Rodrigo Luger from the center from computational astrophysics

1029
03:47:15,399 --> 03:47:22,280
at the Flatiron Institute suggests that all super earths evaporate, except that instead of steam,

1030
03:47:22,280 --> 03:47:28,600
they turn into liquid water. He believes that super earths are formed from separate pieces of

1031
03:47:28,600 --> 03:47:36,280
ice. Then they migrate closer to their star. That's water. And an ocean appears completely

1032
03:47:36,280 --> 03:47:42,520
covering the surface of the planet. Perhaps such planets are the most common in the universe. Among

1033
03:47:42,520 --> 03:47:50,200
the more than 4,000 exoplanets discovered by the Kepler space telescope, about 30% fall in the

1034
03:47:50,200 --> 03:47:56,920
super earth class. If we want to migrate in search of a better place to live, we need to focus

1035
03:47:56,920 --> 03:48:04,600
exclusively on super earths. After all, the remaining 70% truth, it's not a super earth.

1036
03:48:04,600 --> 03:48:12,120
Its theoretical mass and size are not much larger than our earths. However, all known is much closer.

1037
03:48:12,120 --> 03:48:19,000
Okay. Diana Kasikowski, a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany,

1038
03:48:19,000 --> 03:48:26,360
believes there may be liquid water on planet GJ 357D. So she plans to search for other signs

1039
03:48:26,360 --> 03:48:32,840
of life on it in the near future. A little further, at a distance of 39 light years from-

1040
03:48:32,840 --> 03:48:34,120
Oh, you're making it sound so weird.

1041
03:48:34,120 --> 03:48:36,440
...is another super earth, GJ 180D.

1042
03:48:36,440 --> 03:48:39,559
I told you it was earths. I fucking told you this was fucking happening.

1043
03:48:39,559 --> 03:48:46,809
Everybody, do you- Listen to me. Four and a- Three or four hours ago, I was talking about

1044
03:48:46,809 --> 03:48:51,530
how many fucking earths existed. There's a shitload of earths. We're one of like a million

1045
03:48:51,530 --> 03:48:56,739
earths. Everybody calls me crazy. This guy has like a list of four of them already.

1046
03:48:56,739 --> 03:49:04,340
It's 7.5 times larger than the earth, but its main feature is unique. Most exoplanets are

1047
03:49:04,340 --> 03:49:10,899
tidally locked, meaning the same side always faces its star like the moon towards the earth.

1048
03:49:10,899 --> 03:49:14,979
This makes it impossible to form the magnetic field necessary-

1049
03:49:15,940 --> 03:49:22,500
...a brown and a red dwarf. Still, scientists have found candidates for life among other

1050
03:49:22,500 --> 03:49:29,940
types of planets. For example, K2-18b. It's considered a super earth, but its composition

1051
03:49:29,940 --> 03:49:32,659
is more like a mini-Neptune. This is an intermediate class of planets-

1052
03:49:32,659 --> 03:49:37,940
And weirdly enough, none of the inhabitants have noses. Trying to figure out

1053
03:49:37,940 --> 03:49:39,540
science just couldn't figure out why.

1054
03:50:07,940 --> 03:50:21,670
What do they name the planets like this? Why wouldn't they call it like, I don't know, like

1055
03:50:22,549 --> 03:50:35,159
earth five? Earth like ten? Earth like twenty? Why is it like KGI-42BE1? Just say earth like

1056
03:50:35,159 --> 03:50:49,909
one and just keep numbering them. It's literally trillions. So count to trillion.

1057
03:50:50,549 --> 03:50:58,620
It's not like we don't have the numbers to count them. It could be earth like EL-1000 whatever.

1058
03:50:58,620 --> 03:51:12,540
You could you could hyphen it. You could change it. DC Comics Universe trademarked that idea.

1059
03:51:13,420 --> 03:51:17,909
Watch TikTok compilations. Why the hell would I do that?

1060
03:51:19,110 --> 03:51:41,780
All right, let's go back to this. We watch more science. Name the eight planets without looking.

1061
03:51:41,780 --> 03:51:57,530
Sure. Saturn, Jupiter, Neptune, and Earth, and Mars, Venus, and Mercury, and Jupiter.

1062
03:52:00,329 --> 03:52:13,209
Did I miss one? I said Mars. Uranus. How could I forget the fucking comedy planet?

1063
03:52:14,969 --> 03:52:18,569
A gotcha war with supersonic powers. Enemies who are hit by his warp speed sonic

1064
03:52:18,969 --> 03:52:23,370
nitorio move don't even realize they've been hit until it's too late. They're dead.

1065
03:52:24,170 --> 03:52:48,040
I'll give it a try. Where's he? Sonic Samurai. Sonic. All right, we're gonna have to take away

1066
03:52:48,040 --> 03:52:58,790
Ant-Man. No, I want to test him out. All right. Command girl has to go away for now. 320.

1067
03:52:58,790 --> 03:53:29,620
350. Where's the double ninja? There we go. Water. Resident sleeper. Liquid water.

1068
03:53:30,260 --> 03:53:50,700
This is my enemy. Oh, sweet. I can handle both of you. Orochi. Let's go.

1069
03:54:02,139 --> 03:54:27,770
Gotcha. Slaves of the humans. I don't really follow that. Fly away. Turn and fire. I got grabbed.

1070
03:54:27,770 --> 03:54:37,110
I got grabbed. I got grabbed. I got grabbed. I got grabbed. He grabbed me. He got me. All right,

1071
03:54:37,110 --> 03:55:10,709
come on, Ant-Man. Do you have bugs? This guy sucks. Unfortunately, he's not very good. Yeah,

1072
03:55:10,709 --> 03:55:18,200
I'm sorry. This is a bench scenario here. This is a bench. This is a bench. Your bench. Check out

1073
03:55:18,200 --> 03:55:50,760
this new guy. Cool. Pretty, pretty strong. My God. Come here. The dash is good, but not against

1074
03:55:50,760 --> 03:56:01,670
these guys. Where'd you get that? He's weird. That's all I have to say about that. Hey, where'd

1075
03:56:01,670 --> 03:56:16,920
you go? He's weird. It looks like Seath. No, he's weird. Hey, welcome to the stream, guys.

1076
03:56:18,280 --> 03:56:43,110
Look at this guy. He's weird. See you in four minutes when I talk again. Come on. He's got such

1077
03:56:43,110 --> 03:56:52,899
good characters. Is there another dragon? Show us your fingernails. No, I feel like you did some

1078
03:56:52,899 --> 03:56:58,940
weird things you want. It's a weird request that I'm not going to give to you. I don't know. I

1079
03:56:58,940 --> 03:57:16,729
don't know what you're doing. I'm going to lose. Just getting stomped again because he has all the

1080
03:57:16,729 --> 03:57:42,709
best characters in the game. Look at this guy. Where'd you get this thing? Stop making excuses,

1081
03:57:42,709 --> 03:57:51,940
man. I have a little baby ninja. He has Seath the dragon and all the Power Rangers. It's not fair.

1082
03:57:52,819 --> 03:58:17,420
Got to train. You're okay. No, you can get grabbed. Get rid of this dumb bug. I don't know. I don't

1083
03:58:17,420 --> 03:58:26,600
like you. You hair. No, not for this one. I'm going with gunman. Gunman, gunman, gunman, gunman.

1084
03:58:26,600 --> 03:58:34,500
And then, of course, bringing you back. Solid so far. All right, and then one more. Level two.

1085
03:58:38,040 --> 03:58:46,760
I like it better. Just redo the whole loadout. No, I just did. And we're going to do this first.

1086
03:58:55,340 --> 03:59:23,670
The bench warmer crew in. We'll have enough of them eventually. This game blue. Where's Drew crew?

1087
03:59:37,299 --> 03:59:41,940
I don't know about that. I don't know about that happening anytime in the next

1088
03:59:42,739 --> 03:59:48,020
six months. Oh, if you weren't here earlier, we could talk about it.

1089
03:59:48,020 --> 03:59:58,389
Block may not have been here earlier. Working on your calendar. May 15th and 16th. I'll be in the

1090
03:59:58,389 --> 04:00:09,829
studio. Green screen DLC for free. Volume two and the Easy Bake Oven stream. We'll be back to back

1091
04:00:11,979 --> 04:00:17,899
that weekend. May 15th and May 16th. Pretty much walked in.

1092
04:00:38,870 --> 04:00:47,270
What about toon town? Yeah, we'll probably do that. We'll probably do all the we're going to do

1093
04:00:48,469 --> 04:00:56,500
the MMO grab bag too. Pretty soon here as well. Probably within the next week or so.

1094
04:00:57,299 --> 04:01:03,770
I just want to get it set up. There's a lot about toon town. I'm in the process of explaining to

1095
04:01:03,770 --> 04:01:06,170
you what happened to toon town and what's going to happen to toon town and where we're going to

1096
04:01:06,170 --> 04:01:28,040
do to town and when toon town is going to happen. What about toon town? Oh, we also have to go back

1097
04:01:28,040 --> 04:01:43,719
to VR too. That's another thing. I'm trying to feel better in a process. I have a ton of VR

1098
04:01:43,719 --> 04:01:50,069
games that I have to play that have come out. We'll do that for like a week. We'll do a VR week.

1099
04:01:51,030 --> 04:01:57,270
We'll probably do that at the end of May. That sounds like a good idea to me.

1100
04:01:57,909 --> 04:02:20,090
But when is No More Heroes 2? All right. Okay. I'll give you a date. I'll give you a date.

1101
04:02:23,500 --> 04:02:46,340
No More Heroes 2. Hopefully never. What? Okay. We're going to do No More Heroes 2 on Monday,

1102
04:02:47,700 --> 04:03:17,000
May 4th. Oh, Wing Soldier. That's my birthday. Uh-huh. Happy birthday. Get a crossbow,

1103
04:03:17,799 --> 04:03:23,159
arrow shot, wing sword, and fly. Wing Soldier is a former border guard and his sharp eyes never

1104
04:03:23,159 --> 04:03:28,180
miss a target. Use the X button to soar over your enemies and unleash your attack. Give him a try.

1105
04:03:28,180 --> 04:03:43,909
200. Not bad. Who do we replace? 230. I can put... Who's somebody's 200? Isn't there somebody's for

1106
04:03:43,909 --> 04:04:03,930
200? 330. What? 220. Here comes the end of the stream voice. Uh-oh. You're not wrong.

1107
04:04:03,930 --> 04:04:15,219
Let's see tomorrow, though. You're not wrong.

1108
04:04:26,540 --> 04:04:37,139
That's actually pretty good. Is that good enough, though, to justify having nothing else?

1109
04:04:37,940 --> 04:04:51,100
That's all this guy has. I mean, it has a good recharge rate. Does he even have... Oh, no,

1110
04:04:51,100 --> 04:05:17,770
he does have an attack. Okay. He's having a little bit of trouble with the regular default

1111
04:05:17,770 --> 04:05:38,010
guy. Okay. He's not terrible. He's not terrible. He's going to end the stream with what? All right,

1112
04:05:38,010 --> 04:05:59,450
I have to pay attention. Wait. Why is my calendar up? Please play Patapon. What's Patapon on? How do

1113
04:05:59,450 --> 04:06:06,600
I play it? What am I going to play it on? It's on the PSP. What the fuck? How am I supposed to do

1114
04:06:06,600 --> 04:06:36,549
that on PS4? Okay. Okay. I'm going to be playing Patapon day after tomorrow. That's done. Got it.

1115
04:06:36,549 --> 04:06:55,659
Locked it in. That's a lie. It's not. What's happening tomorrow? I love this game. I want

1116
04:06:55,659 --> 04:07:25,290
to play it tomorrow. I love it. I love this game. It's so fun. It's fun just to play. Come on. I

1117
04:07:25,290 --> 04:07:34,120
never play just a game and play. I'm always pooping my pants and shit my pants. I'm playing this.

1118
04:07:34,680 --> 04:07:59,340
I got just turned into. Damn. Give it to me. Play tomorrow. Yeah. I'm going to play this tomorrow.

1119
04:07:59,340 --> 04:08:07,270
Then we're going to do Patapon day after that. Don't worry. I'm going to get my fill out of this

1120
04:08:07,270 --> 04:08:23,659
game over the next 24 hours. Trust me. Have I ever played Wattam? No, I have not. I heard it's very

1121
04:08:23,659 --> 04:08:42,889
fun though. All right. This is it. I'm at the end. I need that helmet back. Who's my ally? Because

1122
04:08:42,889 --> 04:09:00,920
they're kicking the shit out of this guy. Don't die. This is all he has. I have to get around him.

1123
04:09:00,920 --> 04:09:04,200
I'm just doing support inquire. He'll just go in and dive in and kill him.

1124
04:09:05,139 --> 04:09:14,440
It is another person. We're going to play Devil May Cry 2. I don't know.

1125
04:09:19,700 --> 04:09:24,979
Spawning in and getting hit right in the mouth and dying. That's too bad.

1126
04:09:34,059 --> 04:09:47,370
Yes. Literally any one of them, but this is the third claw robot. I don't want three of these.

1127
04:09:47,930 --> 04:09:59,610
Give me another one. Oh my God. 100. Why are you fighting both us and the death force? Revenge.

1128
04:09:59,610 --> 04:10:06,309
The gachaborgs are the enemies of my father. Vito, I will give you a free lesson. The death

1129
04:10:06,309 --> 04:10:11,979
crystal is an important item that can bring you to the sky fortress. Next time, let's battle to

1130
04:10:11,979 --> 04:10:35,700
see which of us will be the ultimate winner. So his father. Ultimate winner. Finish it? I have

1131
04:10:35,700 --> 04:10:41,690
to finish this. What are you talking about? This is the, I'm almost at the end of the game.

1132
04:10:42,409 --> 04:10:54,340
What do you, how do you, how the hell would you know that? Up until like 12 hours ago,

1133
04:10:54,340 --> 04:11:11,510
you guys didn't even know this game existed. I want ship. I like ship. I want more ship.

1134
04:11:12,149 --> 04:11:29,129
I want like three of them in a row. Google. Is it, is it time to beat things on gachaborgs?

1135
04:11:29,129 --> 04:11:43,350
I don't know. I'm not sure they would be. I mean, it's like, it's, there's only 12 to 30 hours.

1136
04:11:50,950 --> 04:11:57,940
Main story, 10 and a half main and extras 22 and a half. I'm not just doing only story missions,

1137
04:11:58,500 --> 04:12:22,180
but you are. I'm not. As you have to remember, we've paused like three times to talk about

1138
04:12:22,180 --> 04:12:36,090
fucking like dog food. This has been at least a full probably 45 minutes of this stream.

1139
04:12:36,649 --> 04:12:39,450
And the last one had been about, I've been dog food conversations in quotes.

1140
04:12:40,170 --> 04:12:53,510
All right. I want to send these to the warehouse. Fuck these things.

1141
04:12:54,149 --> 04:13:01,159
It's taking up space. These battle girls send them to the warehouse.

1142
04:13:10,870 --> 04:13:16,500
What are you 350? Why can't you be 330? That's annoying. Which one are you? There you go.

1143
04:13:16,500 --> 04:13:26,389
I'll use. Yeah, you're pretty good. Well, here's the thing. When I play tomorrow,

1144
04:13:26,389 --> 04:13:28,870
if I finish the game, when I finish the game, I'll probably finish the game tomorrow.

1145
04:13:30,540 --> 04:13:33,899
If it's still, I'm not just going to stop streaming if it's only been a few hours.

1146
04:13:36,739 --> 04:13:40,579
Like I said, we go, we're going to be going like four to six hours a stream.

1147
04:13:41,219 --> 04:13:58,659
Defeat the special unit. Here comes the third day of this.

1148
04:14:07,750 --> 04:14:33,620
Okay. That hurt. That hurt. Oh, why? What the fuck? Oh my God. Why? Somebody broke something

1149
04:14:33,620 --> 04:14:57,020
fucking crazy. I had, I read it and it fucking made me get hurt. I fucking can't even. Why did

1150
04:14:57,020 --> 04:15:44,780
you say that? Can a nuke hit a plane? Oh, sick. Drop it. No, I'm going to get hit by the nuke.

1151
04:15:44,780 --> 04:16:04,659
Ooh, just outside. Wait, here it comes again. Quick run. Run. He's going to kill this as well,

1152
04:16:04,659 --> 04:16:18,649
isn't he? I'm going to hide in the shoe box. I'm safe. We should have worked. Don't fire that

1153
04:16:18,649 --> 04:16:52,709
thing point blank, man. Nope. One, two, three. One, two, three. I can't even do it. I have to

1154
04:16:52,709 --> 04:17:07,799
have like four glasses of wine. It was a fresh meme, fat earther. I think you just did. I think

1155
04:17:07,799 --> 04:17:43,590
you just did. Little hill. Ooh, the dragon's den. Let's do it. Same team. 7900 GF. All right.

1156
04:17:43,590 --> 04:18:14,200
Give them everything you got. Turn. Go. Blast turn. Go. Flat turn. Go. Flat turn. Fire. Hey.

1157
04:18:14,760 --> 04:18:21,780
Fucking goddamn fucking game. Play this tomorrow. Yeah, see if I play this tomorrow.

1158
04:18:21,780 --> 04:18:42,440
Fucking game is so stupid. What power do you have? I'm not even close. Holy shit. I'm doing it.

1159
04:18:48,489 --> 04:18:54,170
What the fuck? One of them is doing ice. Why did you fall out of the sky?

1160
04:18:56,389 --> 04:19:40,170
Okay. Mike, mute. What? I should fix it. Whoa, watch out. Did you copy a dragon? That's actually

1161
04:19:40,170 --> 04:19:53,750
a really good idea. You probably can. I'm still doing okay though. I'm going to save this power.

1162
04:19:57,290 --> 04:20:32,629
Or am I? Oh, super frog. I can't stop saying that, can I? This one's so many dragons. What

1163
04:20:32,629 --> 04:20:58,709
the hell? I won't ever stop. I won't. Excuse me. Do I have an ally still? Or they did. Dead.

1164
04:21:00,340 --> 04:21:44,059
Dead. Well, I did a lot of work. Right through the gut. Which one's more dangerous? Ice or

1165
04:21:45,530 --> 04:22:00,870
that's bad. It's okay. I gotta get out. Oh, come on. I didn't even see. It wasn't even on the screen.

1166
04:22:01,590 --> 04:22:21,350
It wasn't even on the screen. Important. Here we go. Die and... All right. This one was kind of

1167
04:22:21,350 --> 04:22:36,540
annoying. Glad I don't have to do that again. Real wink. It's a bad dodge ratio. Oh well. Dragon.

1168
04:22:48,600 --> 04:23:02,379
Nice. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Give me another one. Give me ice dragon too. Oh, that's what we call

1169
04:23:03,260 --> 04:23:19,540
good. How much are they worth? Let's take a look. Thunder dragon. 1100. 500 health. Thunder bomb

1170
04:23:19,540 --> 04:23:25,450
and thunder breath. Roger Borg, who was born from a huge storm cloud. The thunder dragon is an

1171
04:23:25,450 --> 04:23:31,530
incarnation of electricity and can control lightning using his horn as a lightning rod.

1172
04:23:32,250 --> 04:23:51,690
Cool. Fire dragon's a thousand. Fire breath and fire bomb. Huge shits. Big bits.

1173
04:24:01,379 --> 04:24:11,750
Uh, there were big bits. 5,000 of them from core monster. 50 bucks. 5,000 bits. They were right.

1174
04:24:12,469 --> 04:24:19,129
Thanks for the huge money core monster and core monster says, are you doing okay Jerma?

1175
04:24:20,420 --> 04:24:28,379
Yeah, I'm doing great. I'm doing great. I'm having a blast. I'm having a great time. Things are going

1176
04:24:28,379 --> 04:24:43,620
good. Hope they are going good with you as well. Thanks for the gigantic money. More community

1177
04:24:43,620 --> 04:25:02,700
subs coming in from Mick. Thanks a lot, Mick. Six community subs. Remember blink twice. Three,

1178
04:25:02,700 --> 04:25:14,760
480. Three, 10. I like you. Let's try the dragon. Uh, dragon over here. Let's do it. Defeat the

1179
04:25:14,760 --> 04:25:35,540
ultimate cannon unit. That's the longest I've gone without blinking. I have no idea. All right. It's

1180
04:25:35,540 --> 04:25:51,430
the mega cannon. He's so slow. Holy shit. He's gone. I'm getting hit with everything.

1181
04:25:53,190 --> 04:26:00,649
All right. Settle down. This thing's a fucking firework. What? He's one of those fireworks that

1182
04:26:00,649 --> 04:26:13,110
you sit on the ground and light like those fountain things. Bad matchup. What the fuck?

1183
04:26:15,860 --> 04:26:22,520
Oh, cause he. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's all right. I'll get it right here. Just don't get

1184
04:26:22,520 --> 04:26:30,889
anywhere near him. I mean the blast. That's probably it, right? Is it two of these? If this

1185
04:26:30,889 --> 04:26:38,790
two of these is going to be bad. Oh, there's like five of these actually. This is like probably

1186
04:26:38,790 --> 04:27:08,100
four or five of these. I need fast flyers. I know you want sex appeal with this dream,

1187
04:27:08,100 --> 04:27:22,950
but I don't think the dragon's for you. That's funny. I fast you. We need speed. Fast, fast,

1188
04:27:23,350 --> 04:27:39,819
fast. Who's fast? Battle girls are fast. Valkyries fast. Uh, other Valkyries are fast.

1189
04:27:40,379 --> 04:27:56,360
So it's going to be just about dashing around and flying around. Let's try it.

1190
04:28:06,549 --> 04:28:19,299
You also need people that are fast. So you come on in. Damn it. I had a joke there.

1191
04:28:20,100 --> 04:28:30,780
Restart it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. What happens if I quit? I'll do it next time.

1192
04:28:31,260 --> 04:28:50,329
All right. Let's make sure I have full charge. Get the fuck out. Hey, get what the where are

1193
04:28:50,329 --> 04:29:17,450
all these people coming from? It got me. It got me grabbed. Get away from me. Touch that.

1194
04:29:17,450 --> 04:29:40,219
It's like the samus ball. Oh my God. Oops. Holy shit. That wasn't fast enough. Can't shoot up. Can

1195
04:29:40,219 --> 04:30:05,700
you? This thing's still on me. Oh, this sucks. Ass. Okay. I got to be chunky people, beefy.

1196
04:30:13,159 --> 04:30:28,979
Jesus. This is bad. It's because of the dumb capture device thing. Dodge. I can't move.

1197
04:30:31,799 --> 04:31:10,139
Just dodge. Just dodge that. Dodge it. Just run. Just dodge that. Make a dick flatten. All right.

1198
04:31:10,700 --> 04:31:23,030
It's time. It's time to call somebody up for the minor league. You get in here. You get in here.

1199
04:31:24,629 --> 04:31:41,579
You get in here. What? Oh, I had secret weirdos. No, none of you. Not hatchet, man. He sucks. Just

1200
04:31:41,579 --> 04:32:03,459
give him a shot. Oh, who else can I even use here? Thunder dragon. If this doesn't work,

1201
04:32:03,459 --> 04:32:08,840
I'm going to do thunder dragon. 200 points. Oh, but just get a free ninja.

1202
04:32:27,139 --> 04:32:48,600
Yes. Yes. Here we go. Go. Get over there. He's going to make it. He's going to make it.

1203
04:32:50,659 --> 04:32:56,120
He's going to make it. He's going to make it. Oh, yes.

1204
04:33:08,409 --> 04:33:35,619
All right. Time to bring in the big guns. Can't shoot something that's behind you.

1205
04:33:35,619 --> 04:34:03,509
I'm going to try thunder dragon. Under dragon and it's time for thunder dragon.

1206
04:34:03,509 --> 04:34:33,270
Under dragon and then hatchet man. Strategy is just fly immediately. Where's the dragon?

1207
04:34:33,270 --> 04:34:59,529
Wait. Okay. We're going to get over there with the ninja. Just kill hatchet man. Is anybody fast here?

1208
04:35:00,540 --> 04:35:03,259
I didn't even mean to press that button, but we're going to use mana.

1209
04:35:03,900 --> 04:35:37,080
Copy. I don't think I can copy them. Made it. All right. Here we go. I'm supposed to fly.

1210
04:35:37,639 --> 04:35:46,180
You know, you've been trying. I said it worked. It worked. It worked. It worked.

1211
04:35:46,180 --> 04:35:55,610
It's going to stay in the corners. Oh, fuck. Fly the other way. Fly the other way. Get up.

1212
04:35:57,270 --> 04:36:08,709
Jump. Jump. You fucking worthless. Jump in the air. I couldn't do anything. I was stun locked.

1213
04:36:08,709 --> 04:36:32,459
Can I just have like five of these guys? Fuck this mission. God damn it.

1214
04:36:33,340 --> 04:36:55,430
Do X with the dragon. All right. I'm going to do it right now. Heal the support units.

1215
04:36:55,990 --> 04:37:01,909
Well, I mean, I just, I die instantly. If I get, if I'm on any part of the map that he's facing,

1216
04:37:01,909 --> 04:37:12,919
I'm just dead. It's an instant dead. You got to be all the way at his side. Are you going to get

1217
04:37:12,919 --> 04:37:20,009
right? And this doesn't matter. It's over. I've tried and I'm dead. All right. Get over there

1218
04:37:20,009 --> 04:37:56,680
and just zap them. Just keep it up. Just puke on them. Oh, that's great. And now I'm fucking

1219
04:37:56,680 --> 04:38:11,369
grabbed. That does a lot of damage. All right. Where's the other one? Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1220
04:38:12,169 --> 04:38:23,220
What the fuck? Oh my fucking Jesus. Get up and grab your head, man. It's not that I'd get up there.

1221
04:38:24,900 --> 04:38:40,540
My head. Okay. X immediately. I'm pressing X the second the game starts. Oh, I got to be the

1222
04:38:40,540 --> 04:39:33,529
editing. Here we go. X immediately. Give me a fucking break. Does cover work? Find out right

1223
04:39:33,529 --> 04:40:13,610
now. Nope. He shot me through the wood. It's up to you. Okay. Okay. I'm going to get, what am I

1224
04:40:13,610 --> 04:40:42,060
going to do? I don't think I can copy. I will try it though. Use the jet. Jet actually was pretty

1225
04:40:42,060 --> 04:40:59,450
good. I wish I had more planes. I guess I could probably unlock them here. Okay. Get over there

1226
04:40:59,450 --> 04:41:16,409
and copy. It actually works. It worked. No, how do I? It actually worked. That's unbelievable.

1227
04:41:16,889 --> 04:41:28,549
I can do that. Where's the other one? That might be all I needed. Get the fuck out of the way.

1228
04:41:28,549 --> 04:41:33,369
Forget about the head. Just get out of the way. He's going to fucking fire at you. How the fuck

1229
04:41:33,369 --> 04:41:38,650
are you supposed to get the fuck? Come on. Battery man. Whatever you are. Get over there.

1230
04:41:48,409 --> 04:42:16,150
Dude, the thing just turns on a dime when it wants to fire. Getting close. It fires. I can copy. I

1231
04:42:16,150 --> 04:42:26,389
can copy. Copy, copy, copy and charge. Shoot it. Is it B or X for the charge? I don't know.

1232
04:42:40,860 --> 04:43:01,159
Did it fire? What is going on? Why can't I know? I was holding X and then I got hit and

1233
04:43:01,159 --> 04:43:42,340
all my health disappeared. That's called losing. I have to hold this. Wait, I have to hold

1234
04:43:45,029 --> 04:43:55,900
fire at that. It worked. Oh my God. It worked. Okay. Is there any more of them?

1235
04:44:07,500 --> 04:44:16,500
It's okay. I killed two of them. It comes three. Get over there. You fucking grabbed me. You piece

1236
04:44:16,500 --> 04:44:25,560
of shit. I can't believe it. Dumbest thing ever. Un-fucking-believable. Why? What the fuck?

1237
04:44:27,669 --> 04:44:52,090
Battery man. Attack him. There's another one over there. Get away. Get away. Get away. Get away.

1238
04:44:52,810 --> 04:45:23,479
Where'd he go? Just stun lock him. Don't let him do anything. He's up too high.

1239
04:45:25,060 --> 04:45:45,060
Oh, the screen. All right. That. Oh, okay. Just needs, it's foolproof. I just need support.

1240
04:45:46,549 --> 04:45:55,959
Heal the fuck out of me. Oh, the hatchet guy's still in here. Right. Shit. He's got to go. He's

1241
04:45:55,959 --> 04:46:22,599
got to go. Suck. Oh, it's okay. It's not okay. Fuck you. No. Get out of here. Fucking battery.

1242
04:46:25,380 --> 04:47:07,029
Wait, what? Is everything fine, right? Where'd they go? Are they here? They're in storage?

1243
04:47:07,029 --> 04:47:22,580
No, they're not. Are they still here? Do I just not see them? What's wrong with me? Have I gone

1244
04:47:22,580 --> 04:47:35,560
crazy? They're there. First column. They're right there on screen. Where? I see you. You're here.

1245
04:47:36,619 --> 04:47:50,680
Where's, okay. I thought I had to reset the whole thing. I got to find a character that can do this.

1246
04:47:50,680 --> 04:48:29,659
Nobody got deleted, right? Wait, what? Wait, what? Hold on. Speaking of wait, what? Wait, what?

1247
04:48:29,659 --> 04:48:46,200
Wait, what? What? Here we go. We can edit that together to make it sound better. I'm going to

1248
04:48:46,200 --> 04:49:03,700
stand still. The shield blocks attacks. Will it block this attack? That's the question. We found

1249
04:49:04,340 --> 04:49:17,750
our ultimate counter. Get the fuck away from me. I have to be in front of him. No, attack.

1250
04:49:38,979 --> 04:49:57,939
No cheese for you. Come on, man. What the fuck? Hold on a minute. Does battery man have a shield?

1251
04:49:57,939 --> 04:50:19,639
No, he sucks. You have a shield and you're better. I'll get you close. And then who does

1252
04:50:19,639 --> 04:50:23,000
like an absolute shitload of damage? We need something. We need somebody that does damage.

1253
04:50:25,590 --> 04:50:38,970
360. Wait, the pink magnet. Oh shit. That's not a bad idea.

1254
04:50:58,310 --> 04:51:11,110
I just, no, I picked the wrong support. Like it matters. I'm only picking this because this

1255
04:51:11,110 --> 04:51:38,200
guy has a shield. Okay. Get close enough. Block. But your shield not good enough to block. Wait,

1256
04:51:38,200 --> 04:52:14,139
what? I blocked that shit. Oh, it might be it only blocks energy attacks. Nice. Where's the other one?

1257
04:52:21,830 --> 04:52:56,860
Firing anymore. This thing's not firing. I can't even aim this. Can't grab you. That's so much

1258
04:52:56,860 --> 04:53:03,770
damage. If I could just keep this guy alive, you see how unbelievable that is. They spawn across

1259
04:53:03,770 --> 04:53:22,840
the whole damn map. That's horse shit. That's the definition of absolute dog shit. He just,

1260
04:53:22,840 --> 04:53:38,520
he turns so quickly and then just blows up the whole map. All right. If I throw the head,

1261
04:53:38,520 --> 04:53:43,290
I'll take 50% damage off of them. And then he shoots me and I explode and die because he

1262
04:53:43,290 --> 04:53:51,240
fills the whole map with a radar beam. Just build a fucking army with low cost units. I'll try that.

1263
04:53:51,880 --> 04:54:41,159
Peasant army. Oh wait, they're in the warehouse. Okay. I got 910 flying units too. Flying units

1264
04:54:41,159 --> 04:54:47,639
are pretty cheap, aren't they? 200, 230, 240. What's the cheapest thing? Can I sort by cheap?

1265
04:54:48,439 --> 04:55:28,580
Revolver gunman. Uh, I got 440, 240. All right, let's go. No, these guys are annoying. They help.

1266
04:55:28,580 --> 04:56:35,939
They can't kill us all. Stay behind them. Stay behind them. They can't fucking kill us all.

1267
04:56:35,939 --> 04:57:51,939
All right. Oh shit. I didn't mean to do that. They can't kill us all. Together we are massive.

1268
04:57:51,939 --> 04:58:27,740
Together we are one. Individually we are weak. Together we are strong. Attack. Their defenses

1269
04:58:27,740 --> 04:59:37,259
are down. Attack. Where one dies, one will return. Final battle. This is it. Magnet guy really helped

1270
04:59:37,259 --> 05:00:03,189
too. It's over. Hopefully a crystal that can be combined into a cool monster robot. Nice. Okay.

1271
05:00:03,189 --> 05:00:18,819
Another one. I'm gonna run out of room for these. What am I gonna do with all these Funko Pops?

1272
05:00:29,900 --> 05:00:47,880
All right. All right. That's it. See you tomorrow. That's it. Same time, same place. See you tomorrow.

1273
05:00:47,880 --> 05:00:55,750
Tomorrow we are going to, I wonder how long, how much longer it'll take us to beat the gacha

1274
05:00:55,750 --> 05:01:05,939
force. We beat this game in an hour or two. That's fine. We'll do something else. And then

1275
05:01:05,939 --> 05:01:21,639
of course I'm going to do Patapon the day after that. That's game fun. Hope you had fun. I did.

1276
05:01:24,409 --> 05:01:35,369
We will do Patapon on, what's today? Tuesday? Yeah. On Thursday. Play Jump King. I can't do

1277
05:01:35,369 --> 05:01:43,580
that anymore. I deleted my save. Somebody got a screenshot hopefully eventually. Thanks for

1278
05:01:43,580 --> 05:01:48,779
watching. We'll see you tomorrow. Have a great rest of your night. I'll be here tomorrow.

1279
05:01:48,779 --> 05:01:59,770
Good night. Goodbye. Take care. See you later. Go into the bits and the subs. Start that music.

1280
05:01:59,770 --> 05:02:15,290
Why don't we? So earlier this evening, Peaceful Haley gave $2.50. Excited for the green screen

1281
05:02:15,290 --> 05:02:21,830
stream finally, but I do hope you're doing well. I'm doing all right. I'm doing good. Like I said

1282
05:02:21,830 --> 05:02:27,909
before, doing this whole thing where I don't sit down for that long, more than six hours,

1283
05:02:29,400 --> 05:02:37,689
allows me to stay loose. I can move around. It's still a problem, but it's probably going to be

1284
05:02:37,689 --> 05:02:45,240
for a long time until it is actually solved. So it's not like, hey, I've got to get this figured

1285
05:02:45,240 --> 05:02:50,099
out. It's going to be gone in a day. I'll see you in a day. I think I just have to come to terms

1286
05:02:50,099 --> 05:02:53,459
with the fact that this is going to be a long-term thing that I have to figure out and deal with and

1287
05:02:54,180 --> 05:03:01,560
treat it and see what happens. But it's, I'm feeling better when I'm able to move around.

1288
05:03:02,119 --> 05:03:12,819
I am doing well though. Thank you Maxtronaut for the 400 bits. Jerma, the virus took both my job,

1289
05:03:12,819 --> 05:03:17,909
so I can't sub. Don't worry about that. But here's all my bits. You're my favorite streamer and I'm

1290
05:03:17,909 --> 05:03:27,900
so excited for another round of laughs. Don't worry about subbing to this channel. Use that money on

1291
05:03:27,900 --> 05:03:40,360
you. Thank you though. Cream corn. Thanks for 250. Wow. Cream corn 31. I can't believe I haven't

1292
05:03:40,360 --> 05:03:45,299
played stalker call of Pripyat before. This game is so good. Thanks for letting me play it on your

1293
05:03:45,299 --> 05:03:57,540
couch. I'm going to do it on the green screen. I'm going to sit there and pretend to play a game

1294
05:03:57,540 --> 05:04:04,919
like with you. I'll give you a bunch of different clips of me on a, you know, I mean me sitting on

1295
05:04:04,919 --> 05:04:13,500
couch, just reacting to things. We don't have very many seated reactions. They kind of need to be

1296
05:04:13,500 --> 05:04:20,490
there. And I'm just going to pretend to sit. I'm going to sit down on a fake chair so you can put

1297
05:04:20,490 --> 05:04:29,020
me seated wherever you want. Obstinawal, thanks for the three dollars and 22 cents. Jerma, when he

1298
05:04:29,020 --> 05:05:06,299
plays gotcha force. Hold on. Okay. We'll, we'll try this one. Is that even going to work? Wait,

1299
05:05:06,299 --> 05:05:25,880
is it just tiny? Is that the problem? Oh, it's tiny. What is that? I don't know. That's, that's

1300
05:05:26,520 --> 05:05:33,959
me playing gotcha force. What's more, why do I have a big dent in my head? I don't know.

1301
05:05:33,959 --> 05:05:42,259
I didn't make it. Hurly boy, thanks for the five community subs. Don't think I caught that earlier,

1302
05:05:42,259 --> 05:05:48,259
but thank you. Rosophila, thanks for the 250. You're rambling about how God and aliens would

1303
05:05:48,259 --> 05:05:51,939
create like a hundred planets instead of just one is actually a strong argument for us living in a

1304
05:05:51,939 --> 05:05:57,819
simulation. If a species had the power to simulate an entire simulation, then they may as well simulate

1305
05:05:57,819 --> 05:06:01,979
millions. And if that's the case, there's a much higher chance that we're one of the millions of

1306
05:06:01,979 --> 05:06:22,119
simulations than the one real one. Not a strong argument for anything. Thanks to the 250. Saint

1307
05:06:22,119 --> 05:06:26,840
sauce. Thanks to three dollars. Please play Spore someday. I will go back to it one day. I tried it

1308
05:06:26,840 --> 05:06:34,889
on stream and it was flashing and it was bugs and it was really, really bad. Maybe one day.

1309
05:06:35,450 --> 05:06:40,569
Super Bruce, thanks for the 10 community subs and the five dollars here. Reasons I watched

1310
05:06:40,569 --> 05:06:46,389
Jerma 95, 10% gameplay, 90%. He's ranting about aliens brownies or whether the random

1311
05:06:46,470 --> 05:06:59,689
shit never changed. We had at least 55% gameplay tonight. 60% gameplay. Something like that.

1312
05:07:01,770 --> 05:07:06,419
Thanks to the five dollars though. Smelly boy, thanks for the 250. I'm going to report your

1313
05:07:06,419 --> 05:07:13,270
alien God rant to our atheism. So you better watch out buster. Subreddit for everything.

1314
05:07:13,270 --> 05:07:22,009
I freak out. Thanks for the five dollars and banned from giving messages after the last time

1315
05:07:32,419 --> 05:07:49,900
and banned from giving messages on stream and the screen and the screen face cam. Now they said I

1316
05:07:49,900 --> 05:08:05,990
did it. Somebody says I did it in all capitals. Congratulations. Congratulations. I will no longer

1317
05:08:05,990 --> 05:08:13,590
read bits messages from that view. I'm just telling you, I've look, there's only so many times you

1318
05:08:13,590 --> 05:08:21,750
like give porn codes and make, talk, make up, talk about how you drink at work and stuff. I can't do

1319
05:08:21,750 --> 05:08:45,159
it. I can't do it. I just can't do it. Not safe. He hates that guy. I told you last time. I was

1320
05:08:45,159 --> 05:08:56,330
thinking about just not reading anymore. I'm going to hold myself to that. Banned from giving bits

1321
05:08:56,330 --> 05:09:25,319
for life. You banned from giving me money. All right, we're going to move on. Jerma's low key

1322
05:09:25,319 --> 05:09:37,580
and asshole. You're one of the people that used one of the porn codes like a month ago, aren't you?

1323
05:09:41,500 --> 05:09:56,840
Okay, making sure we know. Hey Sticks Renegade, thanks for two dollars and fifty cents.

1324
05:09:56,840 --> 05:10:01,080
Five grand reminds me when I spent really roughly four thousand dollars on my multiple furry

1325
05:10:01,080 --> 05:10:06,200
commissions over the past four years. That's not a lot. I remember a bidding war on a furry commission

1326
05:10:06,200 --> 05:10:15,259
that went upwards of three thousand dollars for one art. What's a furry commission? You pay

1327
05:10:15,259 --> 05:10:25,180
somebody to make a furry art of you? How big is a five thousand dollar picture? Is it a mural?

1328
05:10:25,659 --> 05:10:55,290
Furry mural. Furry mural. Whatever. That's a lot of money. That's a lot of money. Hopefully it was

1329
05:10:55,290 --> 05:11:00,889
worth it. Hopefully you got quality content there. I hope so. Ajax, the mediocre. Thanks for the

1330
05:11:00,889 --> 05:11:04,889
fifteen dollars. I just watched the public domain VOD earlier. I grew up watching The Three Stooges

1331
05:11:04,889 --> 05:11:13,029
and it was really cool to see it again. Love what you do. That was a fun night. Good to do that

1332
05:11:13,029 --> 05:11:27,740
again. I'm glad you enjoyed it. The Three Stooges and The Ritz Brothers. We have to watch more Ritz

1333
05:11:27,740 --> 05:11:34,790
Brothers movies. They knocked it out of the park with the gorilla. Thanks for the fifteen dollars.

1334
05:11:35,349 --> 05:11:44,389
Glad you liked it. A post thanks to the five hundred bits post. They say, hey Jerma, I had a

1335
05:11:44,389 --> 05:11:49,180
massive panic attack the night before last. It was probably the worst one I've ever had. I was crying

1336
05:11:49,180 --> 05:11:54,860
so hard I puked and was hallucinating. A woman that was painting her nails and telling me to kill

1337
05:11:54,860 --> 05:12:01,319
myself. Holy shit. I've been extremely depressed my whole adult life due to some medical problems

1338
05:12:01,319 --> 05:12:06,259
that forced me to be bedridden from ages 16 to 18. Even then your videos would always make

1339
05:12:06,259 --> 05:12:18,250
me laugh regardless. Damn. I've never I've never hallucinated before but I can imagine

1340
05:12:18,250 --> 05:12:34,069
that hallucinating is fucking horrible. It's just you something is there. Like a person is there.

1341
05:12:34,069 --> 05:12:42,500
But I can't even imagine. I can't imagine. How do I know I haven't? I mean I guess maybe I don't

1342
05:12:43,700 --> 05:12:54,360
think I ever have. They gave another five dollars and they say continued. They say during yesterday's

1343
05:12:54,360 --> 05:13:00,340
stream you read my chat messages like four times and that made me feel so much better. That alone.

1344
05:13:00,340 --> 05:13:04,419
I got some sleep. I actually got some sleep which is pretty rare for me nowadays. I just want to let

1345
05:13:04,419 --> 05:13:08,099
you know that you have been a massive factor in the maintenance of my mental and emotional health.

1346
05:13:08,099 --> 05:13:19,400
The bottom of my heart love you. If I can have that kind of effect on somebody I'm just happy that it

1347
05:13:19,400 --> 05:13:24,709
I'm happy that there's something here for you to care about and like and enjoy. But I also hope

1348
05:13:24,790 --> 05:13:35,750
and I implore you to if you haven't already is to try to get a professional involved. Try to get

1349
05:13:35,750 --> 05:13:52,919
yourself on the path to getting better. It's a never-ending process but if somebody gets something

1350
05:13:52,919 --> 05:13:57,880
out of this stream if you think it's fun you like to be around here that's I'm happy. I really am

1351
05:13:57,880 --> 05:14:01,880
happy that you're around and that you're here to hang out and have fun and laugh and talk shit and

1352
05:14:01,880 --> 05:14:18,650
enjoy the streams. Please please also take care of yourself because even if this gives you some

1353
05:14:18,650 --> 05:14:24,150
this stream can give you happiness or even if some people have said this is one of the only

1354
05:14:24,150 --> 05:14:31,130
things that can. I hope that over the course of the next some odd years of your life you can find

1355
05:14:31,130 --> 05:14:48,180
steps to find other things that do make you happy too. Trying to get healthy and trying to get

1356
05:14:48,180 --> 05:14:54,619
yourself on the right path is everyone's trying to do it but I wish you the best. I really do.

1357
05:14:55,340 --> 05:15:10,299
Thank you post. Have a great night. Thank you. It can be dangerous to put so much stock in one

1358
05:15:10,299 --> 05:15:15,209
thing for your happiness. Yeah and that's kind of what I mean. That's kind of what I mean by that

1359
05:15:15,209 --> 05:15:26,259
is trying to find other stuff that you know makes you happy. It might take a while to find it but

1360
05:15:27,060 --> 05:15:40,409
it's a lot healthier that way but thank you again. Silent serenity thanks for 250.

1361
05:15:40,970 --> 05:15:46,259
It should be noted that the UFO declassified videos aren't new and have been in the circulating

1362
05:15:46,259 --> 05:15:50,259
on the internet for years. More so it's my understanding that the military has a ton of

1363
05:15:50,259 --> 05:15:56,259
these recordings and usually they're determined to be things like birds planes or balloons upon

1364
05:15:56,259 --> 05:16:02,180
inspection. They tend to look really crazy just because of the flight and camera physics involved.

1365
05:16:02,180 --> 05:16:06,979
Videos were originally leaked by a space conspiracy conspiracy theory company

1366
05:16:06,979 --> 05:16:19,639
owned by the guitarist of blink 182. It's a very very strange last sentence that I've it's like

1367
05:16:19,639 --> 05:16:35,259
okay all right I haven't seen these videos I I don't know I whatever there's aliens there

1368
05:16:35,259 --> 05:16:46,389
there is aliens look we're just still here if the aliens if aliens wanted to like focus a

1369
05:16:46,389 --> 05:16:50,729
fucking death star beam at us do what do you think you don't think they've already would have

1370
05:16:50,729 --> 05:16:59,180
done that by now what's stopping them you know what what's like stopping the aliens from like

1371
05:16:59,180 --> 05:17:14,970
just death starring the planet I don't think they want to I don't think they care for now

1372
05:17:14,970 --> 05:17:21,979
it's taking a while to get here wait did you think they they fired it already they fired it like

1373
05:17:21,979 --> 05:17:36,220
four million years ago it's just taking like six billion years to get here it's coming they

1374
05:17:36,299 --> 05:17:48,819
already fired it yeah we still yeah we still got 5.9 billion years left well that's not true

1375
05:17:48,819 --> 05:17:55,880
that you know that that's assuming all the trees are here that's assuming the grass still grows

1376
05:17:57,700 --> 05:18:19,959
not so sure omega lull 2021 omega lull 2021 why is that so funny hey the boom town rats thanks for

1402
05:22:45,139 --> 05:23:00,409
part of a tenth of his personality i kind of nailed it for one second that's it that's adam

school assembly sure he'll answer it for you hey moss lion thanks for the 250 i think i recall

1405
05:23:19,060 --> 05:23:23,319
you saying that you and kim played animal crossing off stream during your move and then you later

1406
05:23:23,319 --> 05:23:27,799
implied you weren't into the idea of playing it live anymore that's all well and good but it'd be

1407
05:23:27,799 --> 05:23:32,520
fun for everyone to get a tour of your island at some point as an aside point much love to you in

1408
05:23:32,520 --> 05:23:41,400
the community you're all a blast oh i just have to hook up the switch the switch is not hooked

1409
05:23:41,400 --> 05:23:49,319
up in here but the ship kind of sailed on animal crossing for me because of the move that was just

1410
05:23:49,319 --> 05:24:00,569
what we did kim and i would just pass it back and forth and play it maybe maybe when i get the

1411
05:24:00,569 --> 05:24:06,790
switch in here we can take a look peaceful hailey thanks for the 250 so i was wondering your opinion

1412
05:24:06,790 --> 05:24:12,389
on fixed camera angles like what resident evil used to do do you think they would ever come back

1413
05:24:12,389 --> 05:24:16,229
i hope not people say it's too risky but they also said that about over the shoulder cameras

1414
05:24:16,229 --> 05:24:19,509
in resident evil and it worked well i don't know i think seeing a fixed camera game in this day

1415
05:24:19,509 --> 05:24:25,189
and age would be interesting and refreshing i really hope not i hate them i'm one of those i'm

1416
05:24:25,189 --> 05:24:29,909
one of those people that makes like the five page reddit essay about how much i don't know i don't

1417
05:24:29,909 --> 05:24:44,360
like them hand controls get rid of them don't ever have them come back fixed camera angles they is

1418
05:24:44,360 --> 05:24:51,619
really this is like a couple scenarios maybe where it'd be interesting but it was just uh no

1419
05:24:51,619 --> 05:25:06,229
there isn't even one remake is amazing yeah but i like to see i'm like i know it's part of it

1420
05:25:06,950 --> 05:25:14,409
i know though you can't see what's in front of you i want to see what's in front of me you open up a

1421
05:25:14,409 --> 05:25:18,409
door and the camera angle is fixed and then you have that problem with fixed camera angles and

1422
05:25:18,409 --> 05:25:22,650
they'll never solve this this is the this is the number one reason why i hate it because the

1423
05:25:22,650 --> 05:25:29,290
trigger point for the other camera angles is this one line if you cross that line it changes the

1424
05:25:29,369 --> 05:25:35,159
camera if you cross back it goes back to the other camera so you end up having a scenario

1425
05:25:35,159 --> 05:25:41,400
sometimes where you are trying to run or do something and the and the camera angle changes

1426
05:25:41,400 --> 05:25:50,389
like four times in 10 seconds it's it's unnerving that's the number one reason why i don't like it

1427
05:25:52,599 --> 05:25:58,740
now if it was a truly fixed camera it would be hard to do that i mean just only one angle but

1428
05:25:58,740 --> 05:26:09,189
yeah you can't do that i mean it's impossible i don't know that me saying this is like oh fps

1429
05:26:09,189 --> 05:26:14,069
these fucking zoomer millennials he wants he wants to shoot things he wants it to be a shooter

1430
05:26:14,069 --> 05:26:21,779
he wants a third person first person he wants to shoot things he's a shooter i know i know and i

1431
05:26:21,779 --> 05:26:28,299
look i get that argument too when both sides are upset with each other that's how you know

1432
05:26:28,299 --> 05:26:34,650
that you came to a true compromise larry david up down left right there he is my that's my guy

1433
05:26:39,020 --> 05:26:49,349
he's like wait why is he why is he god i just did i did like the father son and i looked up and i um

1434
05:26:49,430 --> 05:27:01,830
okay larry centrist dave no larry david don't how dare you larry david is unbelievable and

1435
05:27:01,830 --> 05:27:11,029
he's i would take a larry david god if larry david just came out and was like you know i i

1436
05:27:11,029 --> 05:27:28,599
think i'm gone and everyone agreed i'd be fine with it i'll be like this is actually kind of good

1437
05:27:28,599 --> 05:27:45,479
and the first thing i'm gonna do is introduce fixed cameras i was waiting for the reaction for that

1438
05:27:45,479 --> 05:27:51,740
one because i wasn't i wouldn't feel in that one all right though i think some of you might be

1439
05:27:51,740 --> 05:27:58,380

05:31:04,759 --> 05:31:11,080
what you want to know about light the sun thank you finally a fucking scientist the sun radiates

1459
05:31:11,080 --> 05:31:16,580
energy equally in all directions this means that if the earth were huge we'd get the same

1460
05:31:16,580 --> 05:31:21,540
amount of light as long as we were the same distance to the sun visible light is measured

1461
05:31:21,540 --> 05:31:28,099
in lumens which are measured in square feet of coverage no there wouldn't be a tiny spotlight

1462
05:31:28,099 --> 05:31:49,049
on a huge earth love the streams fucking quack thanks for the three bucks it's that easy a bunch

1463
05:31:49,049 --> 05:31:53,130

1464
05:31:53,130 --> 05:32:07,610
science what a fucking loser i win omega l l not true sun doesn't distribute energy equally

1465
05:32:16,119 --> 05:32:25,610
i'm just kidding hope you know that right um no that's good to know and thanks for telling

1466

1467
05:32:37,560 --> 05:32:48,650
wrong you're wrong you're wrong the sun is not a centrist yes it is it's the ultimate centrist

1468
05:32:48,650 --> 05:32:56,139
actually it is the number one centrist in the fucking universe it is the definition of the

1469
05:32:56,139 --> 05:33:04,950
word centrist it's the goddamn center of the fucking milky way galaxy and the universe combined

1470

1471
05:33:28,970 --> 05:33:35,849

1491
05:37:04,659 --> 05:37:08,659
i want to say you should take a look at the undersides of some of your blockier machine

1492
05:37:08,659 --> 05:37:15,880
borgs like g red it's a very small but cute detail on some of them also you might want to try

1493

1500
05:38:10,619 --> 05:38:15,299

1501
05:38:15,299 --> 05:38:19,779
this super cool game and blah blah okay whatever that's it i'm honestly sick and tired of this guy

1502
05:38:19,779 --> 05:38:23,860
no this is not the message this is real i don't care how much money you give me i won't play god

1505
05:38:49,689 --> 05:38:56,979
weeks hey drosophila thanks for 250 basically your big earth theory needs to be upgraded to a

1506
05:38:56,979 --> 05:39:06,119
humongous earth theory sincerely a huge space nerd this is important this is really important

1507
05:39:06,119 --> 05:39:24,169
this is like a this is another scientist here let's take a look at this it's a big ass days

1508
05:39:24,169 --> 05:39:31,979
are defined by the earth's rotation yeah that's what i said half of earth is illuminated by the

1509
05:39:31,979 --> 05:39:37,450
sun while the other half is in its shadow right the sun is a giant sphere beaming light in all

1510
05:39:37,450 --> 05:39:46,060
directions okay sure the earth is 100 million miles away from the sun fun fact an earth that's

1511
05:39:46,060 --> 05:39:54,330
a hundred times the diameter is approximately the size of the sun what i thought the sun was

1512
05:39:54,330 --> 05:39:59,700
just a really bright gumdrop it's that big i thought it was like as big as a fucking like

1513
05:39:59,700 --> 05:40:12,439
chevy malibu fucking i'm kidding holy shit a fun fact in earth that's a hundred times the diameter

1514
05:40:12,439 --> 05:40:25,180
is probably size yeah okay in both cases the sun shines on half of the sphere that is the earth

1515
05:40:25,180 --> 05:40:30,700
right the only way that the spotlight effect could take place or there could be a substantial

1516
05:40:30,700 --> 05:40:37,580
difference between night and day is if the sun was a point light extremely close to the earth

1517
05:40:38,139 --> 05:40:53,909
or if the earth was thousands of times bigger than the sun well what would happen that oh

1518
05:40:54,630 --> 05:41:06,470
we tried to tell you i look as a thought project thanks the 250 and that's cool i'm glad people

1530
05:42:26,569 --> 05:42:30,090

1538
05:43:44,279 --> 05:43:51,610
made me feel a lot better good job with the peasant army at the end it was fun that's how

1539
05:43:52,409 --> 05:43:56,650
there's always something so horrible when you hear about that kind of stuff

1540
05:43:59,560 --> 05:44:06,419
it's just you feel so awful because you know if somebody takes something from you

1541
05:44:06,979 --> 05:44:11,290
whether it's something you've it's a something you've owned for a long time or something that's

1542
05:44:11,290 --> 05:44:19,299
expensive it's just thankfully i've never had anything really major taken from me but man is

1543
05:44:19,299 --> 05:44:24,419
it scary to think about that i'm really sorry that happened that sucks hopefully you can either get

1544
05:44:24,419 --> 05:44:29,779
it back or your insurance can help you take care of that uh the police obviously i'm sure probably

1545
05:44:29,779 --> 05:44:37,740
