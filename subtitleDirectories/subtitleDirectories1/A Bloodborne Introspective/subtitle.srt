00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:12,169
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with some Bloodborne gameplay and commentary.

2
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:17,140
I was gonna talk about Bloodborne, this video is gonna be about Bloodborne, and more specifically,

3
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:23,210
how I feel towards these games now from- from software, which is always an impossible

4
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:28,920
company's name to say when you're trying to describe something that they made. I'm a fan now,

5
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,439
and I never was. Uh, this is a chat list dungeon, by the way. If you don't know what these are,

6
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:38,600
these are randomized dungeons that are in the game. You collect a certain amount of resources,

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,679
and you consume them, and you can make dungeons, you can save their seeds and share them with

8
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:46,840
people, and it's pretty interesting. It's a cool mechanic. It allows you to continue playing the

9
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,320
game once you're done, rather than continue the cycle of new game plus new game plus new

10
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:57,079
game plus like you used to do in the Dark Souls games. But I finished it. I finished Bloodborne,

11
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:00,679
and that's what we're going to talk about. I completed the game besides the chalice dungeons

12
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:07,670
I still have, and that's something I haven't done in an extremely long time. Single-player games,

13
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:13,030
for me, I don't really play them that often, and when I do, I play them for a couple hours maybe,

14
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:17,349
and I give up on them. I can't tell you how many times I've tried to start Fallout. I've never done

15
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:21,269
that, never completed Fallout. I haven't even gotten past like the character creator in Fallout.

16
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:26,069
I know. I- fuck me, right? And I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I know. I just have such trouble

17
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:30,230
playing these games and loading them up and staying in them and staying interested in them.

18
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:36,170
The last time I beat a single-player game before Shadow of Mordor, because I really like Shadow of

19
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:44,310
Mordor, before that, though, you're talking about maybe GTA V back in 2013. Or, I mean, I don't

20
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,189
really count Binding of Isaac, because Binding of Isaac is very condensed. You can technically

21
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:55,189
beat Binding of Isaac in 30 minutes, right? I'm talking about start to finish storyline game

22
00:01:55,189 --> 00:02:00,790
that's only designed pretty much for you to play by yourself. And yes, Bloodborne does have co-op,

23
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:06,310
and it does have PvP, but I feel like the game, the core game, was designed for you to experience

24
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:13,240
at least most of it alone. And we'll transition from this to talk about the game, Bloodborne,

25
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:18,919
and the Dark Souls games and how I feel about those two and how, you know, I've never beaten

26
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:24,039
Dark Souls or Dark Souls 2. I gave up on them because I thought they were too much. I thought

27
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:30,280
they were too hard, and I thought they were way over my head in regards to everything that was

28
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:36,330
in the game. I didn't get it. I just did not get it. And now, after playing Bloodborne,

29
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:40,969
I finally started to get it. I started to understand why these games were interesting

30
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:45,129
and why they were cool, why they were fun. It was the unknown that was the more interesting thing,

31
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:49,610
rather than having somebody point you in the right direction. And I loved it. I got so into

32
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:54,169
Bloodborne, so into the storyline, it made me want to go back and play Dark Souls 2,

33
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:59,990
because holy shit, I love Bloodborne so much, I'm gonna love Dark Souls. That wasn't necessarily

34
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:06,789
the case, because I did go back and play Dark Souls 2, and it was a disaster. I was getting

35
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:11,430
hit by every enemy. I was walking off cliffs. I was falling to my death. I was getting killed

36
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:16,789
over and over again, and I said, I can't fucking do this. Screw this. I am turning this off,

37
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:23,000
and I'm not doing it again. Wait a second. Wait a second. That is exactly what I had to do when

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,879
I played Bloodborne. When I loaded up Bloodborne for the first time, I had to memorize enemies.

39
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:34,039
I died over and over again at the first two or three stages of Bloodborne. It took me hours

40
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:40,439
to understand where to go and why I was going there in the first place. So why then is it so

41
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:47,110
hard for me to play Dark Souls when I understand, I get it, I know why I like these games? And the

42
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:52,330
answer is pretty simple. If you and I were sitting on a couch right now, and on the screen was Super

43
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:57,610
Mario Brothers, it doesn't matter what level I'd be on. It doesn't matter what world I'd be in.

44
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:04,310
If I handed you that controller, you would know exactly where to go and exactly what to do. You

45
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:09,159
could not even, even if you weren't even in the room, you could be stumbling into the house with

46
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:13,319
a bunch of grocery bags in your arms and be like, holy, what are you playing Mario? Let me sit down.

47
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,399
Oh, let me check this out. And with one hand, pick it up with like holding your chin down

48
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:22,970
on the grocery bag and you'd probably be able to beat the level or at least know what to do to a

49
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:28,089
point where it would only take you a few tries to get close to beating it. You know what I mean?

50
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:35,420
Replace that with Bloodborne. Same exact scenario. I just give you the controller in a random part

51
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:42,250
of Bloodborne or a random part of Dark Souls. If you've never seen that before, the chances are

52
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:47,769
very high that you're just going to walk up the stairs and die, or you're going to get far enough

53
00:04:47,769 --> 00:04:51,209
but not know where to go. And then you're going to look at me and you're going to go, hey, what am

54
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:56,220
I supposed to do here? Do I open this door? This door is locked. I can't go in here. And then I'm

55
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:04,620
going to say, uh, you know, I have like 70 hours in Bloodborne. I fucking don't remember if that's

56
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:13,019
the door that you get the key and hold on. Let me open the Wiki page because this is really confusing

57
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:19,259
the shit out of me. The open-endedness of Bloodborne and Dark Souls and just the sheer amount of stuff

58
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:24,939
that's so cryptic that you need to almost figure out as a community to even know what the item does

59
00:05:25,579 --> 00:05:30,620
is something that I've never really experienced before. And that's going back to the why I haven't

60
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,339
played Dark Souls and why I haven't really gotten into it and how I didn't really like it.

61
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:40,019
You have to relearn it all again. There is no universal just sit down and play it because

62
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:44,819
everything is so open-ended and there's so much information in each one of these games

63
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:49,589
that it's daunting. And it's something that I have to get over because I really do, like I said,

64
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:53,670
I do want to go back and I want to beat Dark Souls, I want to beat Dark Souls 2, but I have

65
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:59,990
to take my brain out of the, this is Bloodborne, I know Bloodborne. It's like, yeah, there's a

66
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:05,189
million similarities to these games from game to game, but you have to just learn it. You have

67
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:10,149
to just let the experience happen for you and know what you're getting into before you start it.

68
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:14,980
So that wraps up this video. Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it

69
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:20,100
and I'll see you guys all next time. Probably gonna play some new game plus in Bloodborne,

70
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:25,050
although I do want to make a new character at some point. I don't know, I might just give up

71
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:30,089
on it entirely and try to beat Dark Souls or Dark Souls 2. I don't know, but we'll cross

72
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:34,500
that bridge when I crush it. We'll cross that bridge when I crush it. Thanks, everybody.

73
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,300
Take it easy. Have a good day and goodbye.
