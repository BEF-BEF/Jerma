1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:16,179
Well, have you guys been just sitting there spelling? I saw T-E. T-E. T-E. T-E. And I realized, oh, it's because half of you were saying T-E, half of you were saying L-A. Right. I see.

2
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:29,559
Well, too many of you guys were doing T-E because that's all I saw. Yes. How are you? I'm not supposed to be here. I'll be right back.

3
00:00:29,559 --> 00:01:06,650
Two minutes have to go by before I say a word. Be right back. Two minutes? It's been 12. Yeah, I know.

4
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:15,560
Okay, listen, you guys ever do a thing where you're in the shower and you get you say to yourself,

5
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:22,359
I'm going to give myself 10 minutes, eight minutes to take a shower. Okay, take like just get in there.

6
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:27,560
I'm just going to wash my hair. I'm going to wash my body. I'm going to whistle for 30 seconds,

7
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,200
you know, and just sit there in the hot water. You get to the part where you shampoo your hair

8
00:01:33,349 --> 00:01:39,459
and then every time limit you gave yourself never existed. After the shampoo goes in,

9
00:01:39,459 --> 00:01:44,069
it's almost like you can't count anymore. It's like, all right, shampoo is going in. I got like

10
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:48,870
60 seconds. I can do this in 60. And then everything, it goes blank and you just sit,

11
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:55,060
it's like 15 minutes goes by. And then you realize that you like glitch out as a human. You're like,

12
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,180
wait, no, I was supposed to get out of here. I was supposed to get the fuck out of here.

13
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:07,180
Once I get the lather into the hair and I run my head underneath the hot water, it's like a reset

14
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:13,580
button. I don't know if the hot water gets involved in your brain or something. I don't

15
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:18,120
understand. But I've run my head under the hot water and all of a sudden it's like, oh yeah,

16
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,680
that's what I like. And now I, now I don't even know what, what was I doing? What was the plan

17
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:37,370
today? So I, I stayed in there for an extra few minutes. Hot water melts his brain. I don't know.

18
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:44,360
It's like, I don't know. Maybe it's like a little, I don't understand. Should I bring that up to the

19
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:51,300
doctor? Yeah. Hey, every time I get like hot water running over my head, I forget, I forget where I

20
00:02:51,300 --> 00:03:00,680
am. That doesn't happen. I'm kidding. You promised us eating on stream. Did you, did you, you must

21
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:09,509
have not have watched the stream from three days ago, four days ago. Jeremy, you promised us eating

22
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:15,479
on stream. I did. I did it. I ate the Whopper. I ate the chicken sandwich and I ate the salad,

23
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:20,060
which is the French fries. That counts as a salad, it's potato, it's vegetables.

24
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:49,770
Hold on. I don't like where this mic is. Give me a second. Okay. That's better.

25
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:55,620
Yeah. I didn't like the placement of the mic. It was, it was making me very angry.

26
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,620
All right. So what we're going to do today, we're going to go back to Jedi Academy,

27
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:09,530
going to finish it. I have one more chapter left and then we have to discuss how the next

28
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:14,409
three or four weeks are going to play out. Those of you that have been on this channel for the last

29
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:24,230
year or longer know that 2020 was supposed to have about two or three very major streams in it.

30
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:32,839
I ran into some medical problems in 2020 and obviously the coronavirus fucked up everything,

31
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:40,310
right? So a ton of those streams that were supposed to happen in 2020 have been moved

32
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:49,350
into 2021. So the theory is over these, the baseball stream comes to mind. That's the number

33
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:58,649
one, big one. The theory is that in the first quarter here, we will do a couple of really big

34
00:04:58,649 --> 00:05:09,379
streams. The theory here. So over the next few weeks, cause we're already into January and it's

35
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:14,790
like, oh shit, it's already January. It's already almost middle of January. So I need to take some

36
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:21,939
time to make sure that these big streams are going to be ready to go. We've got, I didn't

37
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:29,110
forget. People think I forget the 30 webcam stream. That's going to happen soon. The 30

38
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,790
webcam stream is not going to happen in like six months. That's going to happen like probably in

39
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:42,779
the next like 45 days. So we're working on that. That's like the next one. That's the first one

40
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:49,370
you'll probably see. Baseball stream is going to be after that. So we're going to really try to get

41
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:56,980
that to happen, but it requires a little bit of time. So streams are going to be kind of sporadic

42
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:03,860
here over the next three or four weeks. While a bunch of work is done on these various streams,

43
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:13,779
your 1080 is going to fry. That's another thing. I'm glad. Hey, thank you. Not a plant for bringing

44
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:19,139
this up. I have, I'm doing the new computer is happening like over these next three to five

45
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:24,019
weeks. So I'm getting a new computer. I'm going to upgrade this computer. There's a lot of, I,

46
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:31,430
I'm stupid and I can't do anything. So I need help. Good luck getting a GPU.

47
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:41,029
Don't worry. I'll get one. We've been, you've been saying that we've been saying that shit for like

48
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:49,879
the last four and a half months. I have to get one. So I'm going to be building a new streaming PC.

49
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:56,180
I'm doing that. This is just kind of, I've got some friends that I want to hang out with.

50
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:05,899
No, I've got, I've got to go. I've got to go visit italics. It's been like six months since

51
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:13,779
I've last seen that guy. No, this is a lot going on and streams are going to be a little

52
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:24,310
sporadic here over the next three or four weeks. So we will go from there. I'll give you a good idea.

53
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:40,779
He's your friend? Yes, he is. Pour milk into the GPU. All right. We, all right. Thanks for the tip.

54
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:46,699
I appreciate it. I don't have, it's not here yet. So you're like, you're like three and a half weeks

55
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:55,019
early with that one. The bird watching stream. That's another one. The plan is for me and my

56
00:07:55,019 --> 00:08:00,379
manager, some of you know, the producer of a lot of these events that have happened,

57
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:05,339
we're going to just block out a shitload of stuff to do in the first two quarters of 2021.

58
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:12,819
Some of them are already done and they just need to be streamed. But now is the time for that stuff

59
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:24,540
to happen. So all this long winded thing is for me to tell you, break Andy's taking another break.

60
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:34,779
No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm not taking another break. I'm kidding.

61
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:40,889
But you'll probably see maybe like a couple of streams a week for the next three or four weeks.

62
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:48,139
I'm not taking another, I'm kidding. I thought I looked at the, uh, like the calendar of streams

63
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,740
that I've done and I'm like, Oh, how many streams have I done over the last like month or two?

64
00:08:54,460 --> 00:09:00,460
And it's like, Oh, right. I took like all the holidays off because that was like 10 days off.

65
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,940
And then like, Oh, the time to go break, break Andy again, like another 10, like doing 15, 20 days

66
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:12,059
off. Oh, I mean, that's like, like, I mean, I, I can't do that. So no, I'm not going to do that.

67
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,509
You'll see a couple of streams a week until we get a solid sort of foundation on everything.

68
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:30,500
But I am insanely excited for 2021. The baseball stream is ready to go. We just need a date and

69
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:38,100
we need the venue to be ready. That's it. We've ever, it's ready to go. We were ready to go

70
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:44,309
back in August, but we had to stop it two weeks before the event was going to happen.

71
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:50,809
We had to pull the plug on it because there was a huge spike in COVID and we just couldn't,

72
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:56,120
we just were like, this is not something we can do right now. It was back in that period where

73
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:04,629
it was just a major, major spike in like every major city in America. So over these next three

74
00:10:04,629 --> 00:10:13,820
to five months, we'll see. We're hoping that we can get it done. How about right now? It's worse

75
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:18,539
now. Well, we're not doing it now. Oh, you can hear Star Wars. You're not supposed to hear Star

76
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:28,860
Wars yet. We're not doing it like tomorrow, but to do a, to do a major stream like this in like

77
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:35,960
April, we need to make sure that it's ready in January, in February. You know, it's got to,

78
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,240
we have to, you can't just like, you can't just like in April, like be like, Hey, it's time to go,

79
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:51,480
go, let's do the stream. These things take time later today. When's the hacker stream? Well,

80
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:02,629
just, I've, there's, that was going to happen. It was, I think it was a little back and forth.

81
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:11,480
I had to do with, with Twitch to make sure that like, I could do that. There was a little back

82
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:17,929
and forth. We're still kind of, I'm going to figure that out. God damn it. Stop like pulling

83
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:25,029
a truck into my driveway. There we go. When is the, no, no. When's the bathtub stream?

84
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:36,820
Illegal streams are the best streams. Illegal streams are also what they're called illegal

85
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:41,320
because then I get in trouble. And then what do you want me to do? I need to do an illegal.

86
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:48,779
Stop playing trumpets in my fucking garage. Stop doing that. Stop playing. Just leave me alone.

87
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:59,580
And the cat boy stream. That's another one. We look, there's going to be a shitload of streams

88
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:05,399
in 2021. A ton of them had to get pushed from 2020. Like I said, so it's just like we got,

89
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:10,980
we got double time to do. That's what I got to say. Long story short, after today's stream,

90
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:17,350
I'll see you in like four days. Four day break Andy. All right, let's go. That was such a long

91
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:24,340
winded way for me to say, I'll see you guys on, that was an insanely long winded way for me to say,

92
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:34,340
I'll see you on Thursday or Friday. And oh my God, that's another one. We have,

93
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:40,340
there's a huge Minecraft server that's being worked on and it's awesome. It's fucking awesome.

94
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:45,379
You have no idea how awesome this is. You have no idea how, how fun this is going to be.

95
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:53,669
Not FTK. It's just a Minecraft server. It's just Germacraft. You guys are going to love it. I've

96
00:12:53,669 --> 00:13:02,649
seen so much of it already. No mazes. I promise. There's a look. We, we, we, I don't hurt my hand.

97
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:10,649
We got a lot going on in 2021. Let's fucking go. Anyways, you guys, you can play the trumpets

98
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:17,059
again if you want. We're going to continue our Sith training. We, oh wait, wait, let's give some

99
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:23,929
context here. Uh, the context is, uh, we're, we're like about to fight a, we're about to fight a

100
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:29,980
monster. It's way too loud. Those of you that missed the last stream from two days ago,

101
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:36,070
we were in the middle of fighting the, uh, the, the rancid monster. I haven't even used this new,

102
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:43,210
I made this new lightsaber. All right. Well, hold on. I need his help. What was the goal of this?

103
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:50,840
Holy shit. That jump. Don't eat him. Don't eat him. Don't eat him. Don't eat him. Please don't eat

104
00:13:50,840 --> 00:14:07,460
him. Like what? Holy shit. What? Wait, was he giving me like a chance? It's so loud. Hold on.

105
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:15,210
All right. Is it loud for you? It's really loud for me. I mean an intruder.

106
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:28,549
I forgot I had that move. Right. I forgot. I forgot I was unbeatable.

107
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:36,840
Then what do I have to do? Just lure him away. Oh shit. Oh, you also got force lightning, don't

108
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:45,960
you? Oh, I see. Somebody else also has a fucking lightning tool in Premiere Pro. Oh, fuck you.

109
00:14:46,679 --> 00:15:00,409
It's on easy. No, it's not. Wait, maybe it is. No, it isn't. Oh, hold on. He's spitting acid at us.

110
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:15,100
Wait, why is he just puking? What do I do? What should I do? I'm gonna go this way.

111
00:15:19,539 --> 00:15:34,149
Press this button. Press this button. What the fuck? Wait, hey. There's a button I can press

112
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:44,899
here, but I can't activate it. Why? Oh, here we go. Oh, wait. It's a crane. It's picking up. Is

113
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:51,350
it gonna drop it on his head? All right. I'm gonna drop this on his head. We're gonna anvil this guy

114
00:15:51,350 --> 00:16:04,820
like Looney Tunes. All right. Now it's I guess that gives me an opportunity. Should I go that way?

115
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:16,629
What the fuck are you doing here? All right. So now if I walk him over here,

116
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:26,419
do these things matter? What do these things do? They are. I'm gonna. All right. You're gonna

117
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:35,399
turn into a fucking pinball. There goes his fucking head. There goes his head. There goes. Oh,

118
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:49,399
my God. I cut his whole. Wait, why is this? Holy shit. I'm fucking out of here. All right.

119
00:16:49,399 --> 00:17:01,480
So just remember what works now. Cool. What is it? This one. Did I? Oh, I just instantly

120
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:09,819
killed that guy. There's a lot of reverse Jedi here. If you wait, I have a question for you guys.

121
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:16,569
Star Wars lore heads. If you have a red lightsaber, does that automatically mean you are a Sith?

122
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:26,059
Can you have red lightsabers just because you like the color red? Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. But what if

123
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:30,940
you just like put like red Sith? What if you just have like Sith food coloring or something?

124
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:36,220
Does that could you do that? If you had an orange lightsaber and you like just kind of died the

125
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:42,019
like just added a red light into it or something. He's still bad. What if you just like the color

126
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:54,970
red? I did not kill him in the air. Come on. That's bullshit that you are fucked up. Okay.

127
00:17:54,970 --> 00:18:16,180
What? So you're fucked up if you like the color red. What happened to me? I like the color red.

128
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:23,559
Therefore, I'm evil. No, but hold on. We've got an all capitals lore master here. This is all

129
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:29,019
capitals. They were very upset about this. No, but depending on which lore context it is,

130
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:32,299
there is a certain process required to make your lightsaber crystal red,

131
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:37,259
which only a Sith would do. So you probably wouldn't have a red lightsaber in that context.

132
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:43,099
Otherwise, if it's just a normal crystal, then yeah, it's basically team colors. But red is

133
00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:51,930
only for the Sith team where the Jedi get like six. Okay. So, okay. What if I had the the kyber

134
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:59,269
crystal that was in front that was orange and then I had like a red led that I got from Home

135
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:06,460
Depot on top like in front of it to make it like a red tint. Does this does that make me an evil

136
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:25,859
person? Am I a bad guy? Why? What's with Jedi's in the color red? Then get ready to be sliced up by

137
00:19:25,859 --> 00:19:34,579
a Jedi for having a Sith lightsaber. I can't stop it. All right. Where do I go from here? Over here.

138
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:40,779
That was I just gonna do it was like hey, that's not so you fall damage. Yeah, I'm gonna say.

139
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:48,819
All right, let's go this way. How about we just power this guy? Yep, get powered. All right.

140
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:57,000
No. All right, slice them. No more dismemberment, by the way. It happened for like one second.

141
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,420
We got to cut one guy's head off. All right, watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out.

142
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:15,609
I just goomba stomped it. All right, go, go, go, go. Here he comes. Oh my god. Here comes the rancor.

143
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:34,980
Hey, look. There's a guy coming behind. Look at the guy with the two sabers. It's like oh my god.

144
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:40,599
This is my chance. This is my chance. Can I get him? Can I slice his leg off? He's laughing at us.

145
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:59,690
Do something. Attack. Nice keyboard turn, rancor. Now we know who paid for their account.

146
00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:23,660
Oh, he's dead. Okay. All right, don't get killed. I think I have like realistic lightsabers on too,

147
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:35,140
right? Is that why I'm getting killed in one hit? I can't stop it. Basically, yeah, okay.

148
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:38,549
But why even fight anything if the rancor is just going to kill everybody?

149
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:47,380
We could just have like, look, their AI range is only that far and then they just get...

150
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:53,299
Thank you. Yeah, nice try. Look, their AI range only goes so far and then eventually the rancor

151
00:21:53,299 --> 00:22:08,059
is just going to kill them. So why am I even wasting my time? I don't. He can't fit through

152
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:16,660
this door. Can he? He just sneaks his head under here. All right, no, dismemberment's still on.

153
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:31,589
I think he just ate somebody. What? I'm trying to lead him in here. What am I doing? Oh, you idiot.

154
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:44,839
All right, get in here. I don't know why. I figured if I led them in there he would just

155
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:53,049
kill them instantly, but he killed me instantly. What an idiot. I don't even fight them. Just go.

156
00:22:53,769 --> 00:23:11,420
Let's press left and right click at the same time. Is that this guy's internal monologue?

157
00:23:15,109 --> 00:23:27,130
What? Why did we just get a narrator? All right. Oh, how did he get in here? What? Um, I would love

158
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:40,059
it if I could click this button. Oh my god, he doesn't stop during the cutscene. Come on.

159
00:23:42,259 --> 00:23:46,420
It's on easy. It's not on easy. You can't change difficulty unless you reload a whole new video

160
00:23:46,420 --> 00:24:06,200
game. What should I do? Checkpoint. Oh, all right. Wait, does he just have to press a button here?

161
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:16,859
Am I safe in here? I don't think he can do anything. No, there's a huge window right here

162
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:38,359
he can come through, but can he come through it? Yes, apparently. I guess he can. Sure. Touch it.

163
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:47,099
Touch it. Now what does that do? Maybe I can trap it between those containers and the door.

164
00:24:48,940 --> 00:25:12,519
Uh, okay. I don't trap it between the containers and the door. Like, he wants me to trap him right

165
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:20,299
there? Just squish his head on it? But how do I? He needs to be standing there. All right, hold on.

166
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:37,910
Okay, come on over to this side. Over here. Get over here. Stop. He's stuck in the door.

167
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:48,950
Well, I think that guy's dead. He's stuck in the wall. I think if I turn him around, I think this.

168
00:25:49,670 --> 00:26:03,720
All right, come on. Oh, you idiot. You eat me. I'm gonna be so fucking mad. All right, come on.

169
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:16,339
Get over here. It's so many slashes on him. There we go. All right, I cut his arm. Here we go. Now,

170
00:26:16,339 --> 00:26:27,319
ready? Here we go. Give me the indicator. Give me the indicator. Give me the fucking. I just

171
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:41,430
stabbed myself with my own blade. Oh my god. Isn't this the thing that comes down right here?

172
00:26:41,990 --> 00:27:00,980
Super speed. Another console right here. Oh, he's in slow motion. All right. Um,

173
00:27:01,779 --> 00:27:15,349
how's this a secret area? What? All right, then lead him back here and then press it when he

174
00:27:15,349 --> 00:27:41,289
gets right there. All right, press it. What the fuck? Wrong computer. What do you mean?

175
00:27:42,089 --> 00:27:59,509
There's a button on here inside the room. Yeah, I dig to get. I can't get the indicator never

176
00:27:59,509 --> 00:28:12,700
shows up. All right. Where you here? Ramp. What the fuck is this place? Oh my god. He just instantly

177
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:27,990
killed me. Yeah, it's going to go. Maybe I can look and stop his head between those containers

178
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:43,980
and the door. Yeah, maybe I can fucking trap him. Wouldn't this be horrible to fight in a hallway

179
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:54,730
like this? You had a double sided lightsaber. Can you only fight in an open area? He's fucking

180
00:28:54,730 --> 00:29:28,220
head off. Come on. Oh my god. Oh my god. This guy's unbeatable. I got also used to it doesn't

181
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:41,700
matter. Okay, he's gone. Save it. Why would I just spin it around in a circle in front of you?

182
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:52,470
Like a baton. Just spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin and walk forward. Okay, here we go.

183
00:29:53,190 --> 00:30:17,049
I got him. I get him. I feel like I cut my own head off. That's when you start when you're really

184
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:22,250
trying to struggle to learn to do yo-yo tricks. And you sort of lose control when you do like

185
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:27,369
around the world and you kind of you cringe your face up and you go and you mouth purses and you

186
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:40,309
just wait for the yo-yo to hit you in the head. Yeah, that's what happened. All right, let's get

187
00:30:40,309 --> 00:30:57,880
him. Oh no. What? He's waiting for his cue? Why didn't he jump over it? He's like, oh shit,

188
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:04,630
I'm not in place. I gotta get into my theater manager's gonna be so mad at me. I wasn't where

189
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:23,779
I was supposed to be. He missed it. He missed his cue. It's okay. It was still a great

190
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:31,180
scene. I've been tracing Tavian's movements over the past few months. It looks like she acquired

191
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:41,160
the scepter from a collector on Kama, then she killed him. All right. Okay, cult sighting,

192
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:51,539
force theft, dismantle, or weapon destruction. Which one? What do you think? You have force powers

193
00:31:51,539 --> 00:32:03,940
other than lightning, but do they matter? Do the cult? We've received word from the chandrillians

194
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:09,140
that some cultists have broken into an ancient tomb that is supposedly the burial site of a Jedi

195
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:20,660
knight. Hurry there and stop them from siphoning that force power. He's lowering the volume a

196
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:31,529
little. Sorry, I just cut off Luke. And what are you guys talking about? I have more powers? Look,

197
00:32:31,529 --> 00:32:42,700
I'm already decked out. Gonna collect his force power. Yeah, wait, what is this one? Jedi mind

198
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:52,019
trick. Get rage, please. Force rage. Jedi is protected against 50% of all damage, has stronger

199
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:57,619
attacks, and cannot die. Oh, why didn't I get this first? However, the Jedi loses health rapidly,

200
00:32:57,619 --> 00:33:02,099
must wait for 10 seconds after the rage before it could be used again. The Jedi must have at least

201
00:33:02,099 --> 00:33:11,900
25 health to use this. Okay, I like the rocket launcher and I like the sniper rifle. I don't

202
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:21,700
even know if those are the two things I picked. It's been two days, I forget. Okay, let me key

203
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:38,359
bind these. Okay, heal, rip, lightning, drain, rage. Okay, rage is going to be R, rage. Drain

204
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:49,099
is going to be, um, I don't know, zero? No, what should it be? G? T? Okay, T. I'm never going to

205
00:33:49,099 --> 00:34:01,880
use it. So that's the rage power. All right, cool. How do I turn it off? I turn it off.

206
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:19,320
I have one HP? What the fuck? All right, how do I get out of here? I don't even- what was that? Who

207
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:24,550
was that guy? Who was that guy? All right, well, I don't- sorry.

208
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:46,360
Off his head goes. Off his head goes. That's not what it is. It's off with his head.

209
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:24,119
He's not quite gone. There he goes. It's me, the Jedi. I'm here to save the day.

210
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:32,949
Hold on just a second. Oh, that's- I thought you guys were just two regular, like, henchmen.

211
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:50,650
Oh, you are. Okay, that guy's dead. Oh shit, you blocked. Oh, see you later. They go all of his

212
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:55,130
body parts too. You have to just watch your body fall. You have to watch your legs fall from your

213
00:35:55,130 --> 00:36:11,909
torso. Man, that's a horrible way to go. Darth Maul. Well, I mean, Darth Maul has this, but it's

214
00:36:11,909 --> 00:36:15,670
red. I'm not allowed to have red, apparently. Even if I like the color red, I can't just add a

215
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:28,730
little bit of red LED. That makes me a bad person. These are ball breaking. Holy shit. I want to

216
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:39,980
ricochet this back at him. Do you think he'd keep shooting? I don't know if I would. You know what?

217
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:48,650
I would probably pick up a rock. It would be probably harder for me to hit a rock back at him.

218
00:36:49,210 --> 00:37:01,739
He had a family. Yeah, he also had an opportunity to stop shooting. I wouldn't have killed this guy.

219
00:37:01,739 --> 00:37:05,019
If he just put his gun down, I was like, all right. I just thought his head came off.

220
00:37:05,659 --> 00:37:08,699
If he put his gun down, I was like, all right, I'm going to leave. I'd be like, all right,

221
00:37:08,699 --> 00:37:25,960
go ahead and leave. Go ahead, get up. Point blank. This has got to feel real bad right now.

222
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:57,429
Come on. Point blank. No, stop bouncing that high. I'm sorry. I can't? Are you sure?

223
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:11,139
I thought I could go down. Is this going to hurt? Well, he had just missed it by a few feet.

224
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:27,980
Too bad. It was a good attempt though. I just heard another one. What was that one for? What

225
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:47,000
did that one do? I don't know. I don't know. I guess we'll never know. All right, here we go.

226
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,980
Save it. I haven't saved it once. Saber color one. Wait, Jeremy, you can change your saber color

227
00:38:52,980 --> 00:39:00,260
with the console commands. You moron, you absolute buffoon. You missed the reference.

228
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:04,659
It was a reference to how Darth Maul died and you missed it. Embarrassing reference. I just saw the

229
00:39:04,659 --> 00:39:12,969
word Darth Maul because I have to. All right, wait. Saber color in console to change the color.

230
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:27,800
Really? That doesn't work. I guarantee you that's a lie. This is a lie. It has to be, right? Yeah,

231
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:49,929
it's a lie. What is that? Okay. You guys, come on. I hate when they do that. It's not fair.

232
00:39:50,650 --> 00:40:11,980
All right, let's do left click, right click. Wait, I have a better idea. Just come over here.

233
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:23,289
No, it's not. You don't do a cartwheel to avoid my attacks up here, man. That's a bad idea.

234
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:46,920
That was me pretending to know what I was doing. What was that? Hold on. Oh, it's the thing that

235
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:54,119
he does in the movie. It's the guaranteed way to die in real life if you ever did this with a weapon.

236
00:40:57,289 --> 00:41:06,250
The little flourish. Now, your head is off. Imagine that back in the medieval times when

237
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:09,289
people actually using weapons like this. They allowed each other to dance around

238
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:16,139
for five seconds. No. No, it was brutal and horrible. If there was an opportunity,

239
00:41:16,139 --> 00:41:32,730
that sword's going right through your stomach. It would be brutal. Holy shit. Hold on. Wait a

240
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:59,800
second. Let me do this first. I'm trying to kill him with it. All right. Finally, we got a raid.

241
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:07,219
We did. Oh shit, we did. This is from Daleks. Thanks to the raid, Daleks. Hope we had a good

242
00:42:07,219 --> 00:42:12,420
stream. Whatever it was. Hey, you may have been playing Jedi Force Academy. If you were playing

243
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:29,699
Jedi Force Academy, then good for you. Welcome, guys. Is that a kyber crystal over there? Is

244
00:42:29,699 --> 00:42:43,530
this like a kyber crystal dungeon? Can I make that jump? Of course I can. I'm a Jedi. No raid song.

245
00:42:50,230 --> 00:43:00,409
There it is. It's a raid song. This place is confusing. Step them from dissecting the tomb.

246
00:43:00,409 --> 00:43:26,679
Okay. Where should I go? The flourish. He just gets lost. So he started dancing around.

247
00:43:29,769 --> 00:43:43,480
Wait, hold on. Dance up. I literally... No, I did the Super Mario thing where you jump

248
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:49,000
and you're terrified and you're panicked about missing a jump. You land the jump, but then go

249
00:43:49,719 --> 00:43:53,960
and jump again when you're right on the edge of the first jump that you actually made.

250
00:43:53,960 --> 00:44:09,699
So I'm sorry. This is the wrong way. There we go. That's what I wanted to do. I'm going back.

251
00:44:20,309 --> 00:44:23,750
You killed... Where you killed those guys? Isn't it... Yeah, it was back here, right?

252
00:44:24,739 --> 00:44:54,860
Yeah. I'm not on like a two or three second delay, am I again? What do I go from here? Check. Check.

253
00:44:54,860 --> 00:45:06,889
All right. Ready? I'm going to clap and you tell me when you hear the clap. Wow, that's actually

254
00:45:06,889 --> 00:45:10,949
kind of long. Why is that long? It should be like three seconds. Why is it like seven or eight?

255
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:21,530
Well, I'm going to do it again. I don't think you guys are ready for it. Why is that long today?

256
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:35,429
All right. Well, I got to go up there. Up there. There's something I can do up there. There's like

257
00:45:35,429 --> 00:45:41,179
an orange thing up there. You're ignoring us. Oh, what are you talking about? I'm not ignoring

258
00:45:41,179 --> 00:45:58,170
you guys. What are you talking about? What are you guys talking about? Here we go. Okay. Shit. Check

259
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:03,900
the doors in the chamber. Is this going to fall damage kill me? Holy shit, it almost did if I

260
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:14,250
didn't heal. I cannot read entire coffee pasta. The chat's going too fast, dude. How am I supposed

261
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:28,900
to do that? Oh, I see it. What? What happened? There's no enemies in this room. There's no bombs

262
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:47,690
or traps are in this room. That doesn't make any sense at all. What actually happened though?

263
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:55,300
The screen started shaking. Was the rancor back? Okay. Now let's force push. Electric lightning

264
00:46:55,300 --> 00:47:16,010
attack. Swing. Pull. Oh, I opened it. All right. Cool. Does my screen look all weird? Yellow saber

265
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:21,320
is underpowered. They don't have, it's, it's who, it's who's wielding it, not who's fucking, what

266
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:44,170
power level it is. It's just a bright beam of hot light. That's all that is. Oh my god, dude.

267
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:55,110
Well, apparently I'm not telling yourself that. Yeah, it doesn't matter. Look, I can go to single

268
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:59,670
too. I'm going to try that. I'd rather, I'm going to, I'm going single for now. Let's see.

269
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:25,590
Get high rage mode coming in. He choked me to death. Get over here. Yes. Let the rage

270
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:36,940
flow through you young master padawan. Let the rage fuel you. Holy shit. Where did you come from?

271
00:48:41,780 --> 00:49:13,260
Time to add a second blade. Okay. No more fucking around. Get over here. It's in slow motion.

272
00:49:14,219 --> 00:49:26,139
Why was it in fast? Why was that in fast motion? All right. Now it's my turn. Fuck off. Get out

273
00:49:26,139 --> 00:49:33,500
of here. Somebody just gave a shitload of money. That's 69 community subs from zap. That's 69

274
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:39,989
community subs. The funny, the funny number. That's a huge amount of substitute. Thank you.

275
00:49:39,989 --> 00:49:52,550
That's insane. Insane. Oh, come on. You got to be fucking kidding me. I just want to kick a guy off

276
00:49:52,550 --> 00:50:24,230
the edge. Okay. Well that worked. Wait a minute. Hmm. That's how you get that shit done. What about

277
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:34,150
you? Can I take you out with a blaster rifle? No, no, no, no, no. Did he just launch those back at

278
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:59,929
me? Holy shit. How are you doing that? Where'd he go? All right. Okay. Oh my God. I just fucking

279
00:50:59,929 --> 00:51:53,210
annihilated this guy. Oh, I didn't have full health. Right. Nice flourish. What am I supposed to do? I

280
00:51:53,210 --> 00:52:30,940
don't know. Fucking kill him. Watch out. Watch this guy strong. Back it up. Let go of me. Let go.

281
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:53,500
Got him. Okay. I did it. Use force push. It's so weak. It doesn't work on people. I can't. Can I

282
00:52:53,500 --> 00:53:08,300
force choke from all the way back here? How do I get over there? Okay. I'm gonna. I can just jump.

283
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:34,920
Can't I? I pressed it. I got it. Let's kill this guy first. When they're two. What the fuck are you

284
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:50,840
doing? I know what that's like though. I know what that's like dude. It's fucking hard to keep you

285
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:59,480
footing. You could have just stepped down. Okay. Let's go. There was. I've been there before. Plenty

286
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:34,860
of times. Okay. So from here, we're going to go this way. Dave, Jeremiah. I got it. Both of us

287
00:54:34,860 --> 00:55:04,119
clearly have no idea what the fuck we're doing. Like it's very clear. Hey, he died twice. Okay.

288
00:55:04,119 --> 00:55:19,079
We're going to go over. Easy. Where do I go from here? I go up this way down. I mean, I feel like

289
00:55:19,079 --> 00:55:26,730
I have to go down there, but I have to go that way. Okay. Hold on. F8 for the fart and burp mechanic.

290
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:46,409
It's real. Oh, cool. Let me press it. Can you imagine if they actually added that?

291
00:55:56,420 --> 00:56:00,969
This place is amazing. It seems like it goes on forever.

292
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:10,389
Don't be so stupid. F8. F8. F8. That's the fucking stupidest thing ever.

293
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:17,110
Why would they add that? That's like, it doesn't make any sense. The Jedi's even like.

294
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:22,010
How am I going to get down there without breaking my neck?

295
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:32,650
How am I going to get down there without breaking my neck? Get to full health and jump and hope it

296
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:55,780
doesn't kill you. Don't land on your neck, Omega Lul. Okay. Yeah. We can do rage. Oh,

297
00:56:56,340 --> 00:57:25,610
oh my God. I have no health. Oh, no, don't do it. I'm okay. Got it. Okay. Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy.

298
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:39,110
Easy. Easy. I had no force power left. That was bad. Let's just snipe this guy. What did he hit

299
00:57:39,110 --> 00:58:15,340
his head? What? How did he do that? That was weird. Did I do this wrong? Oh shit. This is bad. No,

300
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:44,650
hold on. I think I might be in trouble. I jumped all the way down here and I don't think I was

301
00:58:44,650 --> 00:59:23,670
supposed to do that. Can I make it up on the bridge? I see. Not soft locked. Two at the same time.

302
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:39,289
A Jedi's worst nightmare. Oh, just barely have your footing. That was a smart move but it didn't

303
00:59:39,289 --> 01:00:07,539
work out for you. New objective. Why is my game slowing down? Are they letting me in? Okay.

304
01:00:08,099 --> 01:00:15,610
Fuck you guys. I'm just going in the chamber. Get out of my fucking way.

305
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:25,449
There's one guy sitting in the middle. I feel like he's strongest. He is. He's got the double.

306
01:00:25,449 --> 01:00:32,150
Okay. What's in the... Should I go in here? Oh, wait. They're desecrating. All right. Stop

307
01:00:32,150 --> 01:01:02,090
desecrating. This is the same guy. Oh, my God. All right. All of you get in here. I was going to do

308
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:13,980
that to you. Stop. I want to do something to you guys. Stop. I just cut that guy's lightsaber in

309
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:33,590
half. Wait. I'm deflecting their lightsabers back at them? Jump. Oh, shit. They're all working

310
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:57,559
together. That guy got impatient. Let's see. I want to test their patience. These are the

311
01:01:57,559 --> 01:02:03,670
Sith Ritz brothers. Holy shit. He made it. No, he didn't. He was just showing me he could.

312
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:16,659
Okay. But wait. If they deflect it, won't it? They just instantly fucking deflect.

313
01:02:16,659 --> 01:02:24,230
Instantly. It doesn't matter. Look. I shot it in the fucking air. It doesn't even matter. Watch

314
01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:44,010
this. Give me... Okay. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Oh, you weren't even there. You weren't even there.

315
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:49,769
You weren't even in the right spot. Unbelievable. All right. I'm done. I'm done. This is where you

316
01:02:49,769 --> 01:03:10,809
die. You're all going to die. Let go. That's so unfair. Let fucking go of me. Force push. Force

317
01:03:10,809 --> 01:03:20,420
push doesn't work on people. It's not strong enough. All right. I'm going to fight you guys on my terms.

318
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:42,900
Let's go. Yes, it does. Watch. Ready? Force push. Wow. That was very useful. That's not even a cool

319
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:56,099
power. That's not lightning. That's not choke. That's not resurrect the dead. Oh, no. You can't

320
01:03:56,099 --> 01:04:34,760
speak of that power, Jeremy. All right. I'm going to do rage. They can't kill me. All right. I'm

321
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:54,900
done with these three. I'm done with these guys. I really am. Fucking kill them. All right. I can't

322
01:04:54,900 --> 01:05:10,809
fight three. Watch out. Watch out. Watch. Block, block, block. Okay. Got one. Back it up. Back

323
01:05:10,809 --> 01:05:19,429
it up. Back it up. Heal. Does that guy have no head? Okay. Hold on. Got it. That was a nice

324
01:05:19,429 --> 01:05:24,630
little maneuver. Side stepped him. Just one more. One more. Now, he's going to get aggressive. Good.

325
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:53,179
I can do that too. Let's go, motherfucker. Let's do it. I love that Darth Maul move. Okay, I did it.

326
01:05:53,179 --> 01:06:02,260
Defeat the Jedi and find a way to protect the Jedi. What? Defeat the Jedi and find a way to

327
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:27,449
protect the jedi's coffin what do you mean jedi he's a jedi who i see force pull what is this big

328
01:06:27,449 --> 01:07:03,769
button for okay so pull it the big button push the button i can't push it do you pull buttons

329
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:12,250
no but apparently you can't push buttons either in this universe push i already did what am i

330
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:24,710
supposed to go in the car get open what am i supposed to do push the other button i thought

331
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:44,550
i did that already i tried to press i did force push this whole building is collapsing all right

332
01:07:44,550 --> 01:07:57,210
it's just it's just a show it doesn't actually do anything it's gonna blow it's gonna blow

333
01:07:58,489 --> 01:08:44,300
i think i did it we have to stop taveon give a quick little shake on that heel nk thomas yeah

334
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:58,119
whatever all right how about this what's which one's better it was disgusting it was just liquid

335
01:08:58,119 --> 01:09:06,739
shaking in a container that's disgusting do you when you like take a bath are you disgusted by

336
01:09:06,739 --> 01:09:13,180
the sound the water makes when you move around if you take your hand and go into the water do

337
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:24,500
you go oh oh oh my god what this is liquid now we're going to dismantle device a resident jedi

338
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:33,579
scholar kyon recently learned of the planet yelara from our jedi holocron the planet was once home

339
01:09:33,579 --> 01:09:38,539
to a peaceful yet primitive species that was not ready to be integrated into galactic society

340
01:09:38,539 --> 01:09:44,300
for this reason the jedi master broden kelverdox harnessed the power of the planet to create a

341
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:51,420
cloaking device hiding the entire planet from discovery but to the disarray of the entire planet

342
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:59,819
because everything disappeared buildings roads ground people created a major major problem running

343
01:09:59,819 --> 01:10:11,050
into people on the sidewalk accidentally but now someone else has discovered yelora go to yelora

344
01:10:11,050 --> 01:10:14,409
and find out if anyone has been there if the cloaking device is in danger of being stolen

345
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:23,539
it'd be better to destroy it rather than have it fall into the wrong hands sidewalk is still there

346
01:10:24,699 --> 01:10:36,810
whatever device is too powerful all right destroy the planet you got it i got you luke all right

347
01:10:36,810 --> 01:10:58,090
force rage uh is 75 percent force drain is no let's do this um i like this one who's a sniper

348
01:10:58,090 --> 01:11:14,260
rifle no that thing sucks why do i even want it i like that i like these two let's go force push

349
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:30,819
then force choke it do be simple all right i'll try it all right i don't like the orange anymore

350
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:35,939
looks like no one's home guess i should get up to the top and disable that cloaking device

351
01:11:36,579 --> 01:11:44,899
so i have a question for you star wars lore masters uh if at any point in my 40 plus year tenure as a

352
01:11:44,899 --> 01:11:53,579
jedi if i get sick of the color orange can i just change the color can i be like hey um i've been

353
01:11:53,579 --> 01:12:08,310

354
01:12:09,859 --> 01:12:14,869

right we're good ultimate power okay now we're gonna go just pick a door about this one saving

822
03:35:43,049 --> 03:36:10,819
the game quick i'm weak what do you think about that use electricity in the water for extra

823
03:36:10,819 --> 03:36:20,280
damage that makes sense doesn't it no it doesn't turn the fucking lightsaber on why'd you turn it

824
03:36:20,280 --> 03:36:48,309
off why do i keep turning the blade off it's saving power no it's just it's it's not smart

825
03:36:49,110 --> 03:37:08,059
it's very stupid you still have melee the lightsaber would boil the water i don't know

826
03:37:08,059 --> 03:37:14,760
how lightsaber is supposed to work it's just heat right it's so hot that it burns through flesh and

827
03:37:14,760 --> 03:37:28,299
bone instantly that's kind of how it works right they don't it's a saber of light yeah that'd be

828
03:37:28,299 --> 03:38:01,940
hot who's that both dead yes they are save it time for the final confrontation between who tavian

829
03:38:01,940 --> 03:38:10,760
was rosh the entire time no i mean tavian rosh was tavian the entire time wait that's the same

830
03:38:10,760 --> 03:38:19,899
thing i just said it again different way tavian is it there's a big big bad right that they're

831
03:38:19,899 --> 03:38:41,940
working for rosh is the big bad nice no i'm not a jedi look at my saber we both have the same one

832
03:38:42,659 --> 03:38:51,510
and by the way those who don't know to get a red lightsaber it's all it's about punishing and making

833
03:38:51,510 --> 03:39:14,280
the crystals submit to you right remember that i'm reading the lore somewhere he was lying he knew

834
03:39:14,280 --> 03:39:25,510

849
03:44:19,780 --> 03:44:26,700
whatever crystal calls to you or something i know i know what i know how the thing works

850
03:44:27,579 --> 03:44:43,079
it's electrified i feel like i'm dying in this game more than i'm dying in dark souls i didn't

851
03:44:43,079 --> 03:45:05,670
touch anything it's fucking electrocuting me what the fuck when do i get to go so there's

maybe i will serve tavian's gonna be darth vader or emperor or something i wasn't paying any

856
03:47:08,739 --> 03:47:14,969
attention at all when does this game take place you're in between what saga luke looks pretty

857
03:47:14,969 --> 03:47:24,489
young so i'm gonna assume i mean luke doesn't look old or anything after episode six ten years

858
03:47:24,489 --> 03:47:29,989
after return to the jedi okay yeah because he doesn't look old or anything so this is between

859
03:47:29,989 --> 03:48:04,329
the sequel series cool all right okay i get it none of this is canon anymore it's not none of it

860
03:48:10,459 --> 03:48:14,620
jayden oh i found you look like much of a captive rosh did you dream this up

861
03:48:14,620 --> 03:48:21,819
or was it tavian's idea no jaden wait i was wrong please take me back to the academy

862
03:48:21,819 --> 03:48:30,840
i need help okay jayden stay back please don't hurt me you tried to kill me and now you've lured me

863
03:48:30,840 --> 03:48:37,930
into a trap jayden i was scared you have to believe me we're we're friends remember

864
03:48:38,809 --> 03:48:45,819
let's get out of here before alora comes back good that hurt that apparently hurt real bad

865
03:48:46,620 --> 03:48:56,409
oh fuck i am the bad guy look at me betray me again you're always trying to beat me how do i

866
03:48:56,409 --> 03:49:10,760
know this isn't just another trick jay don't do it what finish him jedi wait listen to what you're

867
03:49:10,760 --> 03:49:18,340
saying you're angry don't give into it leads to the dark side right you see the saber i'm holding

868
03:49:18,340 --> 03:49:33,030
dude afraid of dying saber strike him down give into your anger i need a new apprentice

869
03:49:36,790 --> 03:49:42,250
angel and demon on the shoulders who do i listen to deactivate your lightsaber

870
03:49:42,809 --> 03:49:56,600
remain on the path i don't even know what it said why should i yourself said how powerful the dark

871

873
03:50:19,159 --> 03:50:24,680
and rule the galaxy no you get down you're next why should i trade one master for another

874
03:50:24,680 --> 03:50:30,489
the scepter of ragnos is too powerful to be left in the hands of someone as weak as tavian

875
03:50:31,049 --> 03:50:38,219
if anything it should belong to me of course it should i think so you on the other hand are

876
03:50:38,219 --> 03:50:45,299
useless i should have killed you on hoth you won't get a second chance tavian has taught me

877
03:50:45,299 --> 03:51:34,870
much since then oh has he oh fuck no no no i don't want to do that either let's go wait what that

888
03:54:03,479 --> 03:54:10,469

january is probably going to do the little encore awards because i want to do a new poll and do a

1115
05:04:45,610 --> 05:04:52,540
new voting and everything so because they were not on the poll and it probably won't take that
