1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
You see what I got a rush and get a get up there now.

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,419
Yeah, wait, so it is your so that's your fault.

3
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:14,419
But but hold on though.

4
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:16,620
But I didn't I said you good to go.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,820
I'm going to take a shower and get set up and you said yeah,

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,519
you were awake.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,219
Yeah, so you were you were you in like a full-on panic when you

8
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:35,079
said yeah, I was a little confused at first and then I realized

9
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:37,579
I like checked my phone and you hadn't sent me a discord

10
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:38,079
message.

11
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:40,079
So I kind of just laid in bed for a while.

12
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:43,380
Anyways, how you doing?

13
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:44,979
You sound a lot louder today.

14
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,880
I did adjust my mic a little bit this week because I heard that

15
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,380
I was low on yours and I always I don't know.

16
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,979
I feel like I'm low a lot of the time.

17
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:57,579
You definitely I just I turned it down.

18
00:00:58,179 --> 00:00:59,079
You're in a good spot.

19
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:00,079
Good.

20
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:01,979
But yeah, hope you're doing good.

21
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:07,680
You I heard and I did see that you were playing Neo 2.

22
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:11,480
Is there any assessment you can give us I can give you an

23
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,079
assessment because since I talked to you about Neo last

24
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,859
week, I have 40 hours played and I can tell you that this

25
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:19,159
morning.

26
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:21,359
I was really excited to play Elden Ring with you and a little

27
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:23,659
bit disappointed when I realized it wasn't Neo.

28
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,260
Wow.

29
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:26,859
Wait a minute.

30
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:28,060
Hold on a second.

31
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:34,060
So you're this why me just mechanically speaking the combat

32
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,959
because Elden Ring as you said kind of is just attack with

33
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:37,459
weapon.

34
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:39,859
There's like no nuance to a lot of the stuff that you do.

35
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,859
Yeah, there's a lot.

36
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:46,060
I don't like about Neo the first 10 hours were like grinding

37
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:50,159
your face on a cheese grater to try and understand all of

38
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,659
the different words where you need to charge up.

39
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,459
You need to gather enough anima.

40
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,760
No, I still don't even know you need to gather enough

41
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,560
Amarita to charge up your anima to get your Yo-Kai shift

42
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,060
ready.

43
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,159
It's like nothing was designed for a human to understand.

44
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:09,960
But you've kind of grown accustomed to that and you actually

45
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,659
prefer it now.

46
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:16,219
I would say mechanically combat is a lot of fun and I was

47
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,120
even thinking in bed last night because I was like, you

48
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,520
know, he's going to ask me like how would I rate it like

49
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,120
Elden Ring is obviously it's too good.

50
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:26,020
You can't compare but then I was thinking about like the

51
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,919
last Dark Souls like Dark Souls 3 and trying to compare to

52
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:32,789
that and I realized is it just me or was Dark Souls 3 not

53
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:33,889
memorable at all?

54
00:02:35,449 --> 00:02:39,250
I actually went back to try it again the first time in a

55
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:44,349
while and it actually I found myself saying more often than

56
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:47,150
than not going this like sucks.

57
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,180
I don't think it sucks, but I was like, you know how you

58
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,580
like think back to Elden Ring you can think of like Millennia

59
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,580
and the boss at the end like all the shit like even Dark

60
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,580
Souls 2 I have so many memories and I was like, okay,

61
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,379
well, what are the zones in Dark Souls 3?

62
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:08,009
Yeah, there's like the crab in the swamp is like I was

63
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:12,210
really blanking for way too long and it is a great game.

64
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,909
Maybe that's just like the sign that like it's out of my

65
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:17,710
memory and I could play it again, but I'm going to have

66
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,610
to probably do a serious reassessment of where I put

67
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:24,009
from software games because I did play some Dark Souls 3

68
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:26,909
off stream like I don't know last year at some point and

69
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:29,509
I really did it seemed like every single area.

70
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:33,009
I think like Holly was sitting next to me on the couch

71
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,509
and I'm just like fucking stupid like this area is fucking

72
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:39,909
dumb. A lot of the game is set up to like piss you off.

73
00:03:39,909 --> 00:03:42,409
I feel like I took a little bit of a she's like, do you

74
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:45,110
first she's like, do you like this game like I thought

75
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,909
you liked I thought this is like one of your favorites

76
00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:47,810
and I'm like, yeah, it is.

77
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,849
I think they blur together to like some of the areas.

78
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:54,650
I'm like was that Dark Souls 3 the like the like frozen

79
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,349
area with the invisible enemies.

80
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:00,199
I don't remember playing through Dark Souls 1.

81
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:03,199
I think I did it sort of in the same period.

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,900
Dark Souls 1.

83
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,099
I hate with a passion two or three spots in Dark Souls

84
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:14,400
1, but I think as a whole I think it is.

85
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:17,199
It's probably just better than Dark Souls 3 and I had

86
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:17,600
it wrong.

87
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,300
I had it flipped.

88
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:24,180
Who knows?

89
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,980
Anyway, dude, I could go back like a year or two from

90
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,879
now do it play through it again and have the completely

91
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:30,579
opposite opinion.

92
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,889
That's just how these games work.

93
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,529
I feel like around that time was over saturated with

94
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:40,129
like souls like and I played so many and by the time

95
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:42,029
Dark Souls 3 was there was like this was good.

96
00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:47,209
But played so many I feel like I know what about

97
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:47,709
secure.

98
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:48,709
I feel like I'm secure.

99
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:52,709
I just completely just wiped it from my memory and

100
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:53,709
like it was good.

101
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,250
But like I it was it was though.

102
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,949
I remember it was like really really good.

103
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:00,949
It was pretty good.

104
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,050
This game is very loud.

105
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:08,149
Actually, I at the time I was a I was a secure non

106
00:05:08,149 --> 00:05:11,170
enjoyer, but I think I've come around.

107
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:16,470
Yeah, you were a secure row non-enjoyer for a while.

108
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,899
I can't remember.

109
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:22,699
There's like one simple mechanics that pushed me

110
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:25,199
over the edge of like needing to farm for healing

111
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,100
or like just in general like you could only use your

112
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,500
your arm moves a certain amount of times and you

113
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,600
have to like collect arm oil or some shit.

114
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,500
Yeah, why would you gate the like fun mechanic around

115
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,899
like I need to farm enough resource to use this?

116
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,800
Yeah, it's just all these games.

117
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,370
You just like flip on them every like six months.

118
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,069
I have a different opinion of each one of these

119
00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:48,470
games.

120
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,470
It's weird how that works.

121
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,170
I swear.

122
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:50,870
I promise you.

123
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,379
Well, the assessment is Neo 2 I'd say was better in

124
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:56,279
Dark Souls 3.

125
00:05:56,379 --> 00:05:57,480
I have a lot of fun.

126
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,180
The level design is actually crazy good.

127
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:03,279
It has like I wish the areas were a little bit more

128
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:05,680
interesting like Dark Souls environments really can't

129
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,279
be beat.

130
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:09,579
Yeah, but like once you finally get over the hump of

131
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:13,079
these mechanics like do not make any sense and they're

132
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,379
basically non-english.

133
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,680
There's a lot of fun to the game.

134
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,839
I I'm willing to try it.

135
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:24,040
I probably don't think I'd want to scream that game.

136
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,240
I don't think you would I think not streaming.

137
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,339
It is a great call.

138
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:33,839
Okay, I have never been backseated with like such

139
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:38,839
like crazy such as just Determinated backseating.

140
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:41,139
Yes, you're not going to understand what's happening

141
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,939
and you're going to get frustrated because the game

142
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:45,339
has a lot of frustrating shit and you're going to

143
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:47,240
get like mad and you're going to look to chat for

144
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,139
like some sort of like we're in this together like

145
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:52,040
that fucking sucked and chats going to be like you

146
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,199
need to keep pulse more often like dude, you're so

147
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,000
bad like it's me.

148
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,100
It makes me angry.

149
00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:02,180
Hey, so so can I get some support in here and you

150
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,480
just look over and it's just like like the people

151
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,680
have like the stream muted like the mute thing.

152
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,720
Just like oh, okay.

153
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,220
You're not listening.

154
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,420
It has like new content for like new game plus one

155
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,920
two three four like it has a lot of content.

156
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,620
So I think there's some people that have spent like

157
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,699
thousands of hours in the game and then they really

158
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,600
need you to just be better.

159
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:29,000
Okay, so let me ask you a very very important

160
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,399
question.

161
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:34,500
Yes, if I got over the if I got over it the first

162
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,899
10 hours would I like it if I kind of understood it

163
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:40,850
like you do know that what you know about I think

164
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:44,329
the parts that are thrown in your face of like the

165
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:46,230
stance switching and the key pulsing you kind of

166
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,629
naturally you kind of get after a while after the

167
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:50,829
first day like it kind of just I don't really even

168
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:51,730
think about it anymore.

169
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:55,720
Okay, but it's also really not as important as

170
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,379
people would make you think okay, because there's

171
00:07:58,379 --> 00:07:59,879
tons of times on my stream where it's like I would

172
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,779
attack something like dude, he's never people.

173
00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:03,480
When is he going to do the key pulse to get his

174
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,199
stamina back, but it's like they're going to die

175
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,290
anyway, that doesn't matter.

176
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,189
Like yeah, it's just like whatever.

177
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:10,990
Yeah, it's like I feel like the same thing would

178
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,389
happen.

179
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,790
I don't know random comparison slay the spire.

180
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,389
We're like, you know, you have lethal next turn.

181
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:19,040
So you just sort of end turn even though you could

182
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,639
have ended at this turn, but they can't because

183
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,139
you have armor hold on though.

184
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:25,939
I played slay the spire until it got too complicated

185
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,040
where I was like, I don't care anymore.

186
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:31,350
What once it got to be like I had to do five

187
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,649
different math problems in a row.

188
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:34,889
I was like, I think I'll just do something else.

189
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:37,889
I think I'll play something else think we'll play

190
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:38,590
some vampire.

191
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:43,110
I think I unlocked I love how that's an insult now.

192
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,899
I mean just you know, I don't really want to like

193
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:50,879
do anything after I unlocked the poison.

194
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:52,580
There was a poison character and that was really

195
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:52,879
fun.

196
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,759
But then the game got like really hard and I was

197
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:56,460
like, yeah, that was fun.

198
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,659
I like completed a few runs and I'm kind of done.

199
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:01,559
Well, that's what I mean, you know, like you can

200
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:04,159
poison the enemy and you have a they're going to

201
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:05,559
die to poison is your thing on the ground.

202
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,450
I don't even have a game open.

203
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:11,700
Mr.

204
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,700
Rush rushing to get ready.

205
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,129
He's not in the game.

206
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:17,330
I'm not rushing.

207
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,080
I thought you said you rushing.

208
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,879
I thought you said you like jumped up and like

209
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:23,379
panicked and were like, I got to get on there.

210
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:24,480
I got to get my stream ready.

211
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,080
That panic is over.

212
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:26,980
Oh, okay.

213
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,379
So now you just chose a while ago.

214
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:31,840
Yeah, then I realized that was an hour early like

215
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,039
an hour and a half early.

216
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,240
They you if you were really early at that point.

217
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,580
Yeah, I'm ready to go.

218
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,179
Whenever you get your sign on the game with the

219
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,580
mod that I did thing.

220
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,940
I was very prepared.

221
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,399
Hey, dude, it's not even two o'clock.

222
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,100
It's 154 right now.

223
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,950
Oh on time with some with some pregame and I said

224
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:59,350
this to you the buttons for dodge roll is like

225
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:02,450
switched in Neo and it's like hard switch like you

226
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:02,950
can't.

227
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:03,750
Oh, that's right.

228
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,850
You said hey, dude, like please like make sure

229
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,450
you play well today because I'm not going to even

230
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,649
know the buttons of Elden Ring.

231
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:09,350
That's what you said.

232
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,679
I'm a little concerned that I'm going to be trying

233
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:15,759
to keep all some stuff.

234
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,789
So I maybe I do just like get some magic and watch

235
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:21,690
you for a little bit.

236
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,720
Well, I think we're all right.

237
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,620
Our characters are pretty beefed up now.

238
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:29,450
Let's give a quick recap.

239
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,509
So I can do that because you've played a different

240
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:34,909
video game for like 50 straight hours since we

241
00:10:34,909 --> 00:10:35,509
last talked.

242
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:38,460
So we were at the Volcano Manor.

243
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,070
We were rousing around doing a little bit of you

244
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,370
know, an investigation to see where we're going

245
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,970
to go next and I think we ended up saying that we

246
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,039
were going to do a right card, right?

247
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:50,940
That's the next plan.

248
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:51,940
That was the goal.

249
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,240
So to get we never found Volcano Manor.

250
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,639
We don't really we were kind of on our way there.

251
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:56,940
Yeah.

252
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,509
So we're in the vicinity and I think the last thing

253
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:05,470
that happened is you laughed audibly laughed at

254
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:05,970
the character.

255
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,870
That was the the mage character that you thought

256
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,070
was a randomized character, but it's where you

257
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,269
get the Comet Azur.

258
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:15,200
I think that's the last thing we did and I forget

259
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,700
what that is.

260
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:19,059
Is it see the water terminus?

261
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,259
I think I have no idea the words you're saying

262
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,259
Subterranean Inquisition Chamber.

263
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,230
Yokai shift.

264
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:27,529
I opened my way.

265
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:30,029
I where are we teleporting and then you can join

266
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:30,330
me.

267
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:34,330
We are seriously what button interacts with the

268
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,129
bonfire.

269
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:42,730
What why what it's why is going to be oh, no, he

270
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,529
doesn't even know the buttons of the game.

271
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:45,820
Okay.

272
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:48,600
Here's the thing though.

273
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,299
I get exactly what you were you coming from though.

274
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:53,399
It's it's just on the controller for like an

275
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:56,799
Xbox controller B and A are reversed and for the

276
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,700
first like two or three hours and you know, it's

277
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,399
like I hate this.

278
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,200
So I have you played a high five rush by the way.

279
00:12:05,549 --> 00:12:06,350
No, okay.

280
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,350
A lot of people wanted me to play it.

281
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,549
They like stream it stream it with they don't

282
00:12:08,549 --> 00:12:11,850
know is like I got game pass and I'm already in

283
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:12,149
it.

284
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:16,169
It games fucking incredible by the way, but right

285
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:19,269
bumper is dodge in that game and because I've been

286
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:20,970
playing that right bumper.

287
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:24,789
I kept trying to hit B and it just kind of doesn't

288
00:12:24,789 --> 00:12:25,090
work.

289
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,990
So I might be in the same boat for a little while.

290
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:28,080
Okay.

291
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,679
We'll see how our dodging goes.

292
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:33,440
Yeah, my brain got reprogrammed game pass seriously

293
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,919
Xbox ever I'm ever like a few years ago during one

294
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:38,720
of those conferences when they were just talking

295
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,220
about this thing they wanted to do.

296
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,419
Let me just go over it.

297
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:43,120
I know people can say oh he loves game pass.

298
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,940
He's a game pass Andy Monster Hunter rise high

299
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,049
five rush and Goldeneye have all come out in the

300
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:52,149
last like two weeks on game pass.

301
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,629
That's fucking ridiculous.

302
00:12:55,029 --> 00:12:56,529
That's that's actually ridiculous.

303
00:12:56,529 --> 00:12:58,730
Like what that service is unbelievable.

304
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:03,730
What is there a Goldeneye like remaster or something?

305
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:06,929
Yeah, they did like a Goldeneye HD kind of remaster.

306
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,330
Oh, I thought I know there was like a fan version

307
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:09,830
at some point.

308
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,730
I never heard of this one.

309
00:13:12,549 --> 00:13:14,950
I'm just I'm just saying I'm just saying it exactly

310
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:19,019
the way that I see it Xbox everyone Phil Spencer

311
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:19,820
was on that stage.

312
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,419
Everyone was like oh game pass.

313
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:24,450
It's gonna I resent anything I ever said negatively

314
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:27,149
about I respect anything he says because he is the

315
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:29,450
most rectangular man I have ever seen.

316
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,159
Is that I don't even know what that means.

317
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,940
He is fucking squared off.

318
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,250
You know what I'm saying like because of Phil Spencer

319
00:13:41,549 --> 00:13:45,480
I started calling myself the cubic man because I

320
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,080
aspire to be as square as him.

321
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:51,429
I want like you know what they go for the measurement

322
00:13:51,429 --> 00:13:55,029
of like one cubic meter of like I am one cubic

323
00:13:55,029 --> 00:13:56,129
meter of man.

324
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:01,220
I am the exact measurement or well Phil Spencer is

325
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:05,190
but I want to be like him.

326
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:11,639
All right, but yeah, I mean I would say yeah my you

327
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,440
why are you talking about him like he's a Minecraft

328
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,039
character.

329
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:23,629
He is what wait my cameras stage presence dude.

330
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,929
He walks on stage and there's cracks in the floor.

331
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:27,330
What's wrong with my camera?

332
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,730
There's a gap left to close.

333
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,330
Oh, sorry about that.

334
00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:36,950
How did you even see that what but anyways game

335
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:40,649
pass they got this cloud gaming thing and it's so

336
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:42,750
I'm telling you I would not be saying this if I

337
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,789
didn't fucking believe it game past is legit.

338
00:14:45,789 --> 00:14:46,590
It's the real deal.

339
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,990
It's the real deal believe in believe it.

340
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,090
Can you not afford games?

341
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:56,710
No, it's just look I have this problem with video

342
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:57,210
games.

343
00:14:57,509 --> 00:14:58,509
There are a lot of them.

344
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:01,110
Okay, there are a lot of video games a lot of

345
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:04,210
stuff releases indie games triple-a games.

346
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,509
It's like I don't fucking even know what the

347
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:06,710
hell is even I don't even know what I want to

348
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,110
do.

349
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:10,210
So what happens is game pass just dumps once every

350
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:10,710
couple weeks.

351
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,610
Sometimes it's one week.

352
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,809
Sometimes it's three weeks, but at least once a

353
00:15:13,809 --> 00:15:15,009
month at least once or twice a month.

354
00:15:15,409 --> 00:15:17,610
You like you get multiverses on that.

355
00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:24,710
Holy versus is is free multiverses is already for

356
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,210
free.

357
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:26,309
I didn't know that.

358
00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:26,710
All right.

359
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:31,549
Well, yes, you can but anyways having the option

360
00:15:31,549 --> 00:15:35,649
just to have like hey, there's four or five games

361
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:36,649
that are here right now.

362
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,450
Open them right now.

363
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,649
One just play one right now and just with the

364
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:42,049
cloud shit just open it.

365
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:42,950
You don't have to install it.

366
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,649
You don't have to like, oh, let me go read reviews.

367
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:45,350
No, no, no.

368
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,250
Oh like for instance, like, oh, I don't like it's

369
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,450
like a shadow play.

370
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,750
You don't even have to download it.

371
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,750
You you can that's the best part.

372
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,350
If you open one of these up and you're like, you

373
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,350
know, that was actually really fun.

374
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,950
I like that just hit the install button to set your

375
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:00,750
save file continues.

376
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:03,450
You don't have to worry about like, oh, I got to

377
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:03,850
start over.

378
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:04,350
No, you don't.

379
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,320
I'm telling you I will I will be an Xbox game pass

380
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:09,820
fan here.

381
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:12,549
You can be a fan.

382
00:16:12,549 --> 00:16:13,549
It's cool to like things.

383
00:16:13,549 --> 00:16:16,549
Yeah, but I will say it's definitely one of those

384
00:16:16,549 --> 00:16:16,750
things.

385
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,549
It feels like a Netflix like I can just get on there

386
00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:21,049
and be like, what's on game pass today?

387
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:23,649
By the way, there's like a hundred plus other games

388
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,950
that just are on there permanently.

389
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:27,379
Plenty good ones.

390
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:28,779
You should be getting paid for this.

391
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:30,779
No, I don't.

392
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:33,080
I shouldn't because I just I just like it.

393
00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:37,850
What we said any good ones lately any like you you

394
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:38,850
tried something on game pass.

395
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,750
You wouldn't have tried but you actually liked it

396
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,049
a lot.

397
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:42,149
Yes.

398
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:46,549
And it's not like a mobile game called like tar

399
00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:47,350
pit or whatever.

400
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:48,450
Gunfire reborn.

401
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,419
It's pretty good.

402
00:16:50,419 --> 00:16:52,620
Gunfire reborn was just on game pass just opened

403
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:52,820
it.

404
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,720
I was like this is kind of fun.

405
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:55,720
I played it for like at least for probably four

406
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:03,669
or five days gang and also Monster Hunter rises

407
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:04,170
on there.

408
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,670
I was actually kind of thinking about starting

409
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:07,670
that engine back up.

410
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,470
Oh Monster Hunter.

411
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,470
Wait, really?

412
00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:10,970
I'm gonna open it.

413
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:12,269
Okay.

414
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:16,549
Fuck it.

415
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:17,650
What who cares?

416
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,450
There's no pressure.

417
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:18,950
Just open it.

418
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:20,950
Who's going to stop you?

419
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:23,049
Usually pressure.

420
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:27,549
Who's like, excuse me, sir.

421
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,650
You cannot play Monster Hunter rise today.

422
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:34,779
But Monster Hunter really he's not going to stream

423
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:35,079
it.

424
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:35,880
Oh, maybe I will.

425
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,380
I don't know.

426
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:37,579
All right.

427
00:17:37,579 --> 00:17:39,480
Are you like have you opened the game at this

428
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:39,779
point?

429
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:40,279
Yes.

430
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:41,779
I said that I put the thing down.

431
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:42,480
You can join me.

432
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,680
I've just been fucking walking around the bonfire.

433
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:44,980
All right.

434
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,079
All right.

435
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:46,079
Let's go race the grace.

436
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:46,680
Excuse me.

437
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:50,279
Honestly and high fire high fire rush to I that

438
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:51,880
was just a surprise launch.

439
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:54,380
They were just like, oh yeah, by the way, this

440
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:54,980
game exists.

441
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,579
Okay, and it's here now stir-take for now.

442
00:17:57,579 --> 00:17:58,079
No.

443
00:17:58,579 --> 00:17:59,079
Yes.

444
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,779
I was reading all the reviews of high fire rush

445
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,579
and all of them like, can you believe this like

446
00:18:03,579 --> 00:18:05,579
silent drop it's crazy.

447
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:09,279
This is silent silent drop Bethesda's like official

448
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,079
game conference.

449
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:11,680
They're like biggest thing that they do to like

450
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,680
announce all our new games.

451
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,980
They announced it at their biggest conference.

452
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,680
How is that silent?

453
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,779
Did you watch the Bethesda conference?

454
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:25,650
I did well silent in the way that there was no

455
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,549
release date and she's like, oh hey, here's like

456
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,150
the gameplay launch trailer and you can play it

457
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:30,750
right now.

458
00:18:30,849 --> 00:18:32,250
I think that's immediate.

459
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,890
That's why the English language is very different

460
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:36,589
very specific.

461
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:37,990
Yeah, but that's cool though.

462
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:39,190
Okay.

463
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,690
Look maybe not like, oh wow, what a silent stealth

464
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:42,190
launch.

465
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,390
Do you think it's cool to have a gameplay trailer

466
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,789
like a launch trailer and they like, oh by the

467
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:46,690
way, you can download it now.

468
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:47,089
Okay.

469
00:18:47,089 --> 00:18:48,990
So like if you didn't announce that you were

470
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,789
going to do a scream stream and one day you just

471
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:51,990
show up and you start screaming.

472
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:54,089
Is that a silent drop of a screaming stream?

473
00:18:56,339 --> 00:18:56,940
Well, that depends.

474
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,940
Did it take me like three to four years to prepare

475
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,740
the scream stream?

476
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,450
Like how big is that?

477
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,450
Of course not.

478
00:19:05,849 --> 00:19:07,450
So I don't think it makes no, I don't think that

479
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:07,750
works.

480
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:08,849
I hold up.

481
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:09,750
How do you run?

482
00:19:11,369 --> 00:19:12,670
Fucking what?

483
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:17,140
All right, dude.

484
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:18,940
I mean, I know how to do that.

485
00:19:19,339 --> 00:19:20,039
No, seriously.

486
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:20,740
How do you run?

487
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,539
I'm not joking.

488
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:24,140
It's B you hold B.

489
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:27,440
Okay, he's not pretending.

490
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,220
How do you get on the horse?

491
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:33,890
Oh, that's a little more complicated hold Y and

492
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,990
then you probably have a map to one up down left

493
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,990
or right on your d-pad.

494
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:38,529
Okay.

495
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,420
This is going to be a I can't believe I deleted my

496
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,819
entire memory of like how to play this dude.

497
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:45,619
It is gone.

498
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:46,220
Your memory.

499
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,220
It's gone.

500
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,319
I know we were going up left and there was the

501
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:51,119
lava Lake there and we were I think there's a

502
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:57,160
yeah, we we actually need to we need to go back.

503
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,859
I think we need to like actually wrap around here

504
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:01,680
like we're on the right side, right?

505
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:04,279
Thought it was left.

506
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:06,180
I don't think we got up left where we left off.

507
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,180
Can we get up here this way?

508
00:20:13,329 --> 00:20:15,329
Just quietly looking at our chat.

509
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:17,829
Hey, do we get up that way?

510
00:20:17,829 --> 00:20:18,430
I want to go.

511
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:22,130
So wait this one this one down here.

512
00:20:22,529 --> 00:20:24,029
Do you see that dude holding a shield in front of

513
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:24,430
us?

514
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,230
Do you see the shield?

515
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:30,279
The big like look at the shield.

516
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:35,930
It's not finding Nemo where the straight straight

517
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,130
one walking straight towards him.

518
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:37,829
There's a bug.

519
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:39,890
Oh, that's a bug.

520
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,690
I thought that was a guy's holding a shield.

521
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:47,339
Okay, I'm want to like start this back up tomorrow.

522
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:48,440
Are you good?

523
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,539
You want to start this up tomorrow?

524
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:51,839
Looks like Nemo.

525
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,940
Oh my god, dude.

526
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:55,039
Did you get any sleep?

527
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:55,740
Tell me the truth.

528
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:58,740
I didn't know you he didn't get any sleep.

529
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,640
There's a all right.

530
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,339
How about this?

531
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,440
This is what we're going to do.

532
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,039
We're just going to chill out.

533
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,039
All right.

534
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:05,640
We're going to just chill out for a little while.

535
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,839
We're going to like just relax.

536
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,279
We'll play for like we'll play for like a few hours

537
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:11,380
and no, no, no, I'm good.

538
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,279
It'll just take a second.

539
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:13,079
Trust and follow me.

540
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:14,880
Oh, no, I don't know about this.

541
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:16,180
I don't know about this.

542
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:17,180
I know where I'm going.

543
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:17,980
I have memory.

544
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,180
I just don't like my muscle memory of buttons is off.

545
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:24,079
We need to go to Primeval Sorcerer Azure.

546
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,039
I don't want you to I would okay.

547
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:29,539
I would not be following you right now.

548
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,539
No way.

549
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,640
I'm not going to follow the sleep deprived guy.

550
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,640
That's like, yeah, let's walk.

551
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,940
Let's walk through the fire on the ground.

552
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,539
Yeah, we killed the thing.

553
00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:38,240
We killed a boss.

554
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,140
You're the Mariner.

555
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:41,339
No, we got to go to the sorcerer person's body.

556
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,839
No, no, no on the other side.

557
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:43,440
Come with me.

558
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,140
Oh, no, no, you're following me.

559
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,039
I'm leading.

560
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:46,839
I'm the commander.

561
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,740
You don't have authority here.

562
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:49,339
Okay.

563
00:21:49,339 --> 00:21:50,039
You were the sub.

564
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,039
Okay.

565
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,039
Okay.

566
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,339
So here's what's gonna happen here.

567
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:54,539
This path we were going to go.

568
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,539
Do you drink coffee, bro?

569
00:21:56,539 --> 00:21:57,539
Like do you drink coffee?

570
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,140
No, you don't.

571
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:58,440
I don't.

572
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:00,039
It doesn't even drink coffee.

573
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:01,240
I like what do you drink tea?

574
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,400
Time we get you like a nice green tea brew.

575
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:10,559
I take caffeine pills.

576
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:12,359
No, you don't.

577
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,759
What?

578
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:17,660
No, you don't take caffeine pills.

579
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,960
You don't take those.

580
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:21,160
Jerma like an old man.

581
00:22:21,259 --> 00:22:27,460
I literally have in front of me a Monday to Sunday pill holder

582
00:22:27,859 --> 00:22:30,160
and there are caffeine pills one for each day.

583
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,460
All right, but hold on a minute.

584
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,660
We need to do we need to do a little maybe we shouldn't do

585
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,059
this assessment on broadcast.

586
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,559
That's fine.

587
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,059
Okay.

588
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:39,859
How many milligrams of caffeine are in each one of those?

589
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,500
200.

590
00:22:43,059 --> 00:22:43,559
Okay.

591
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:48,359
But I've heard the it does not feel like 200.

592
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,460
Like the like digesting it like that.

593
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,559
It's like if you don't take it on an empty stomach, then you

594
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,359
don't get like a full powered.

595
00:22:54,859 --> 00:22:55,359
All right.

596
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:57,759
But you don't like you don't you don't you just don't like

597
00:22:57,759 --> 00:22:59,660
the taste of coffee or like the way or like tea or anything

598
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,460
like that you have tried to get me to drink coffee before

599
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,359
like you ordered me your like favorite drink at Duncan.

600
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:07,460
Yeah, like one time in Boston.

601
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,559
You fucking hated it.

602
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,559
I did I hated it.

603
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,660
I've tried a lot of different coffee.

604
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,559
It's all just like it's all just why did you guys burn

605
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:16,259
the shit out of this?

606
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:19,160
Okay, so we I think we're guys up here.

607
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,759
We are going the absolute wrong way.

608
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,660
I'm just right.

609
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,960
But you got to watch out because they like they have more

610
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,259
stamina than a yokai around.

611
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,240
There's you look in a dead sleep and you like ripped

612
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,240
yourself out of bed to come over here and talk about how

613
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,140
you like eat caffeine pills every day.

614
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:38,420
The block was different too.

615
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:44,190
I'm just randomly jumping people watching my stream.

616
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:50,599
Like I entered combat attacked jumped back stepped like

617
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:52,299
I don't know what's going on.

618
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:54,500
All right.

619
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:55,799
Hey listen to me.

620
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,700
I want you to open up your menu and I want you to go to

621
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:01,099
Prime Evil Sorcerer Azure.

622
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,880
That's why we're going this way.

623
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,200
Okay, but in a minute we're gonna we're gonna go to donkey

624
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,599
let him cook.

625
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,400
Are you sure about that?

626
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:16,799
I don't know about that.

627
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:18,200
Let me cook.

628
00:24:23,569 --> 00:24:29,099
What the fuck I mean if I die before you do that's gonna

629
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:29,799
be embarrassing.

630
00:24:30,099 --> 00:24:30,900
I could be you.

631
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,569
What like right now?

632
00:24:34,069 --> 00:24:35,670
Yeah, what you were gonna give me an assessment.

633
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:39,940
Okay, my assessment is so is that the only caffeine you're

634
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,539
taking in a day?

635
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:41,640
Yeah.

636
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,339
All right.

637
00:24:42,339 --> 00:24:42,839
That's okay.

638
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,980
But there are some teas and there are some you can like

639
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,680
there are like drinks you can drink that aren't just like

640
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,180
200 milligrams of just caffeine.

641
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,480
They got like vitamins and like hydration and shit if you

642
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,079
really want to.

643
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,680
I have I have matcha tea this morning.

644
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,779
Okay, green tea.

645
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,079
All right, big fan.

646
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:02,380
I used to make it myself, but then I got lazy.

647
00:25:02,779 --> 00:25:04,880
Well, that's exactly what I was just going to tell you to

648
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,180
do.

649
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:12,670
Yeah, I would do I would drink a few matches a day rather

650
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:13,769
than take you a day.

651
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:17,470
You know how much caffeine is in a macho not 200.

652
00:25:18,369 --> 00:25:19,369
Are we like 40?

653
00:25:19,369 --> 00:25:21,269
I'm telling you the 200 is fake.

654
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:25,920
Let me take it's not real.

655
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,319
It is 200 but like I'm saying like it's not it's not real.

656
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:29,819
It's not true.

657
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:30,420
It's not real.

658
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:31,319
I will rest here.

659
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:36,910
We did a full circle also if I literally take one sip of

660
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,009
like a five-hour energy.

661
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:38,809
Hmm.

662
00:25:39,509 --> 00:25:41,710
That's what happened on myriad day.

663
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:46,410
I won a little sip of five-hour energy like like 1 20th

664
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,109
of a bottle.

665
00:25:47,609 --> 00:25:51,009
It it fucks me up and I'm like wired and can't sleep for

666
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:52,009
a day or two where we're going.

667
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:57,210
Yeah, I I don't I one of the reasons why I can't drink

668
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:01,710
stuff like Red Bull really or five-hour energy or pretty

669
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:06,279
much anything that has the like just caffeine in it.

670
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:08,180
We are going the wrong way.

671
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,680
I yeah, but it's okay.

672
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,180
It's all right.

673
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:14,079
No, we've already been we did a full circle.

674
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,480
Wait, no, no, no, no, no trust trust cook.

675
00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:18,380
They say cook keep cooking.

676
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:18,680
All right.

677
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,579
Well, then the other one that's at the stove.

678
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,079
Let's go.

679
00:26:22,339 --> 00:26:22,539
Okay.

680
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,640
So everyone's like, what's the Duncan order?

681
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,339
What's the Duncan order?

682
00:26:25,339 --> 00:26:27,740
Is this what I know we've been this way because we fought

683
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,640
a fucking great putrid slob up here.

684
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,740
We did and we're just going the long way back and around

685
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:37,740
in a complete circle to that sorcerer who is up here and

686
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,839
we could afford it there.

687
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:41,640
But you were at stove and I just kind of let you go.

688
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:43,640
I was serious thousand souls.

689
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,940
I feel like I should spend these.

690
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:45,240
All right.

691
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,539
We'll spend your souls.

692
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:55,259
We have we have switched personalities like for real.

693
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,160
All right.

694
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,059
So now we have to go like around this way like around here.

695
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,440
That's correct, right?

696
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,940
We go like around this right side.

697
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,099
That's correct.

698
00:27:09,579 --> 00:27:13,680
I will follow you anywhere we go like, yeah, we want to

699
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:20,289
go like around let him bake.

700
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,970
Baking does take longer baking takes a little longer.

701
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:25,470
That's right.

702
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,420
Well, you want to go down into the fucking heroes grave.

703
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:32,119
We could the worst Dungeons and Elden ring.

704
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:35,420
Wait, is this the one that with the lava and the chariot?

705
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:38,700
I think this is actually yeah, this might be like one

706
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,900
of the worst most painful Dungeons in the game.

707
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,299
Yep.

708
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:42,099
I don't want to do it.

709
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,849
You're really going to nope out.

710
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:47,549
No, I think this is the worst Dungeon in Elden ring.

711
00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:49,650
It's absolutely this is the worst Dungeon in the whole

712
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:49,950
game.

713
00:27:51,819 --> 00:27:54,619
I think what with me randomly jumping and backstepping.

714
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,319
I think we can I think we can do it.

715
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:00,420
I think the last 15 minutes of this stream starting has

716
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:03,519
proven to me personally that we should not walk down

717
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:04,319
this hallway.

718
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:06,619
What if the chariots are randomized and like we don't

719
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:07,619
even have to worry about them.

720
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:09,789
All right, let's do it.

721
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:13,930
That actually that was enough for me to say.

722
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:14,529
Yeah, let's do it.

723
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:20,839
People watching my perspective seriously take note

724
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,039
of how many times I jump.

725
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:24,329
I have not done it on purpose once.

726
00:28:24,529 --> 00:28:25,829
Oh, I thought you were just doing the thing where you

727
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,130
like jump around Ironforge.

728
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,299
No, every time I jump.

729
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:30,200
I think I'm running.

730
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,650
I think I'm doing something else and if I ever do this

731
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,049
sword, I think I'm blocking.

732
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:40,349
So what you're saying is now you have a great excuse

733
00:28:40,349 --> 00:28:42,950
when you go back to Neo 2 after playing this for a

734
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:45,750
while, you can do like a 30 to 40 minute complaint

735
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,950
stream in the first 40 minutes of that stream talking

736
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,950
about how you relearned these abilities.

737
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:55,109
It's genius citizens.

738
00:28:55,779 --> 00:28:57,609
Oh, all penis.

739
00:28:59,049 --> 00:29:00,750
No, it's not there.

740
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,160
Okay, by the Duncan order.

741
00:29:05,859 --> 00:29:09,559
It's a it's a large blueberry iced coffee with only

742
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:10,559
a few sugars.

743
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:12,160
Wait, wait yours.

744
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,359
You were gonna you said you were going to assess me

745
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:16,859
and your assessment of me was telling me to drink tea.

746
00:29:17,529 --> 00:29:18,130
That was it.

747
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,930
That was I just want to go back for a second.

748
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:23,130
My assessment would be to tell you to stop taking caffeine

749
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:23,529
pills.

750
00:29:24,579 --> 00:29:27,079
Okay, but what if I stop and then I like don't feel good

751
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:28,279
because I haven't taken one.

752
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:37,930
Well, okay, can they be can they be like cut in half?

753
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:39,420
Yeah.

754
00:29:40,289 --> 00:29:42,190
All right, so I'm gonna have these before.

755
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:45,190
Yeah, so do that for a while and do then cut that in

756
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:48,490
half and then once you get used to like that 50 ish

757
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,759
milligrams, I think you're good.

758
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:51,859
Just drinking tea, man.

759
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:53,960
You don't got to do you don't gonna be caffeine pills

760
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,660
or watch out.

761
00:29:57,089 --> 00:30:03,079
Oh, yeah, I forgot why did we come down here?

762
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:03,680
I don't know.

763
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,579
You want to be said it was gonna be randomized.

764
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,680
Oh fuck.

765
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:14,859
Do you not gonna make it you're gonna get fucking squished

766
00:30:14,859 --> 00:30:15,960
to get on the way back.

767
00:30:17,259 --> 00:30:17,960
How do I heal?

768
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:20,059
It's X.

769
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,890
How do I how do I equip it?

770
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,190
What do you mean down on the d-pad?

771
00:30:25,589 --> 00:30:26,289
I'm jumping.

772
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:29,819
All right, you have fucking me up so bad.

773
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:30,819
You have no idea.

774
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,019
Did you just run you over again?

775
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:39,140
No, I don't want to lose my Amarita.

776
00:30:41,109 --> 00:30:41,910
Are you down here?

777
00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:42,609
I'm coming.

778
00:30:42,609 --> 00:30:44,109
Yeah, you freaked me out so bad.

779
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:44,809
I didn't know what to do.

780
00:30:46,109 --> 00:30:49,009
Yeah, because you were like freaking out and you were

781
00:30:49,009 --> 00:30:51,609
all like you were like caffeinated and ran down here.

782
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:54,190
Okay.

783
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:56,490
I think you're weird that you drink more than one coffee

784
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:56,890
a day.

785
00:30:58,119 --> 00:30:59,019
Coffee to me.

786
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:02,619
I'm not gonna lecture you in front of like all your fans

787
00:31:02,619 --> 00:31:04,420
who are gonna like back you up and make me feel like.

788
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,619
Look what you've done.

789
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,420
Look what you've done.

790
00:31:07,819 --> 00:31:08,220
We're good.

791
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:12,799
Okay.

792
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,900
Where are you trying to remember how to heal?

793
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,500
Okay, where do we go?

794
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,900
We're gonna go this way.

795
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:23,000
I think I don't you can go all the I went all the way down.

796
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,500
You can go down further and there's like cool items and

797
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:25,700
shit.

798
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,599
But I don't like we really care walk in the lava.

799
00:31:29,349 --> 00:31:32,049
Yeah, I think if there's like a spot you can go down there.

800
00:31:32,049 --> 00:31:32,849
Let's just go this way.

801
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:36,920
Is the chariot not one shot anymore?

802
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:40,630
I don't know.

803
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:43,829
Maybe we're supposed to be I do remember killing like I'm

804
00:31:43,829 --> 00:31:45,130
surprised we live through one.

805
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:46,730
Yeah, that is weird.

806
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:48,720
But anyways.

807
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:53,220
Drinking coffee for me is this is kind of wow.

808
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,420
It is an important stone.

809
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:04,470
Coffee is more of a thing to kind of dip and relax within.

810
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:05,069
What is it?

811
00:32:05,769 --> 00:32:08,269
I've never played a game worse on stream.

812
00:32:08,569 --> 00:32:09,869
Every time I went to block.

813
00:32:09,869 --> 00:32:11,069
I just drank an elixir.

814
00:32:11,369 --> 00:32:14,470
I drank like three blasts to fight a rat when my health was

815
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:14,769
full.

816
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:17,170
So you really weren't kidding when you were like, hey, dude,

817
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,869
I really don't knock under the buttons help.

818
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,269
It's worse than I thought.

819
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:20,970
Wow.

820
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:24,730
I have like a good talent.

821
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:28,029
I'll say normally a talent for absolutely discarding any

822
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,130
information the moment I just like not useful.

823
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:33,930
Like I just started out during it's in the fucking recycle

824
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:34,230
bin.

825
00:32:34,529 --> 00:32:35,829
That is really interesting.

826
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:46,349
That's how loud a little loud.

827
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:47,349
Why is it so loud?

828
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:48,750
Wasn't like this before.

829
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,039
All right.

830
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:57,180
But yeah, why is it so loud?

831
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,109
Okay, that's better.

832
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,650
Yeah, coffee.

833
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,349
I drink coffee not necessarily for the caffeine.

834
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:10,750
I like just kind of like sipping on something just like

835
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:11,950
a hot beverage.

836
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:12,950
You're like, oh, yeah, that's nice.

837
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:16,069
But most days it's whiskey.

838
00:33:17,069 --> 00:33:18,269
That I'll be honest.

839
00:33:18,269 --> 00:33:20,470
That's like another reason like oh whiskey.

840
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,670
Oh, I'm just gonna like that.

841
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:23,670
Whiskey.

842
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,069
I'm gonna drink it about loud.

843
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:30,140
What that did it that was I was a pretty loud for you.

844
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,339
Usually they're not that loud.

845
00:33:31,339 --> 00:33:31,740
Really?

846
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,289
They hit me weird worse.

847
00:33:35,289 --> 00:33:35,890
No, it that is.

848
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,690
Yeah, hit me weird.

849
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,789
You're farming for worse noise again.

850
00:33:40,089 --> 00:33:47,369
I am actually like in real life did like Sonic damage to me.

851
00:33:50,099 --> 00:33:52,299
Okay, you're fucking me up so bad.

852
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,599
I've drank more flasks in this dungeon that I have like the

853
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:57,400
entire time of playing Elden Ring.

854
00:33:59,299 --> 00:34:00,400
Did you know you could do that?

855
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,400
Yeah, he didn't.

856
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:06,880
What now?

857
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,380
Dude, I don't remember.

858
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:10,650
Watch out the fire.

859
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,449
Oh, it's my little fire away.

860
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:14,349
Okay, watch out chariot.

861
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:17,050
I think we can we can follow this one up.

862
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,349
I think we wanted to but I don't know.

863
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:21,650
I'm afraid that's my fight the boss.

864
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,739
Okay, I'm gonna die.

865
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:36,070
Oh, that's not where that is.

866
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:37,809
Let's just leave.

867
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:39,710
Are you dying too?

868
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,010
Okay.

869
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:41,510
Yeah, let's let's fucking let's go.

870
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:45,909
I thought that you know that level where the this you can

871
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:49,909
go inside and there's like the two little places on either

872
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:53,079
side of the chariot that are down and you go in and I thought

873
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:53,880
it was right there.

874
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:56,179
Yeah, let's get the fuck out of here.

875
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:07,650
Like immediately it was the right place, but it was the

876
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:08,449
wrong side.

877
00:35:08,449 --> 00:35:09,650
Oh shit, whatever.

878
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,519
But yeah coffee is more of a sipping thing just like this.

879
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,119
This is like hydration.

880
00:35:21,769 --> 00:35:23,769
I just like I got to move my hands around.

881
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:30,739
I relate to the move your hands around but not the put it

882
00:35:30,739 --> 00:35:31,739
in my mouth part.

883
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,519
Well, the thing is it's really good that I and like I know

884
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:38,219
that like obviously like cigarettes are one of those things

885
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,119
a lot of people go like yeah, I just always I kind of wanted

886
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:42,320
to have something just like in my hand and like something

887
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,119
to do with my hand and whatever and I'm so glad that I

888
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,219
never ever ever thought to try cigarettes because I probably

889
00:35:48,219 --> 00:35:49,519
would one of those be one of those people that was like,

890
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:52,219
oh, yeah, I just needed to have it in my hand just something

891
00:35:52,219 --> 00:35:52,719
to do.

892
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:56,420
I'm glad I never fucking ever thought to ever do it.

893
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:00,420
You gonna kill this crowd?

894
00:36:07,539 --> 00:36:08,840
What are you doing over there?

895
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,349
It's worse than I'm self-aware.

896
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:22,550
It's like the self-consciousness of what I'm doing is making

897
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,250
it work.

898
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:26,760
I'm giving myself a headache.

899
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,559
You sure those are caffeine pills?

900
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,559
Something else?

901
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,360
I just cast bops barrier like six times and tried to cast

902
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,860
a face thing with my staff like for this thing is actually

903
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,360
kind of hard.

904
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,159
We need to be careful.

905
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:45,719
He's taking mystery pills.

906
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,539
He's taking mystery pills.

907
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:55,150
I got it.

908
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:02,559
All right.

909
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:02,760
All right.

910
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,260
Hey, all right.

911
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:03,559
It's all right.

912
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:03,760
It's all right.

913
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,460
Here's what we're going to do.

914
00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:06,760
You just go.

915
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,159
I got I got it.

916
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,960
You know, what's probably better?

917
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,059
I got a suggestion for you.

918
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,760
I am trying to keep home.

919
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:18,659
What if you went into and change the key vines to make it

920
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:19,559
just Neo 2?

921
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,219
No, you sure?

922
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:25,130
I'm sure that's not a good idea.

923
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,639
That's actually a really good idea because then you don't

924
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:33,539
even have to think about it.

925
00:37:33,539 --> 00:37:34,539
Run is the same button.

926
00:37:34,539 --> 00:37:35,539
Jump is the same button.

927
00:37:35,539 --> 00:37:37,840
Swing is the same button and that thing is actually pretty

928
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,039
good.

929
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:38,440
Isn't it?

930
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:43,599
I don't I don't I don't know.

931
00:37:43,699 --> 00:37:44,800
This sounds dangerous.

932
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:47,750
What do you mean?

933
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:49,639
Oh changing.

934
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:55,099
I don't know why but it sounds dangerous and I kind of want

935
00:37:55,099 --> 00:37:55,800
to overcome it.

936
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,199
This is like the getting over it that kind of game.

937
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:00,199
Well, there's a time for you to do it.

938
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:01,199
It's definitely right now.

939
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,199
Okay.

940
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:05,780
So now make sure we're going the right way.

941
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:15,820
I wish I could see the freaking map.

942
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:20,219
You just I'm going to see I need you to lead for a bit.

943
00:38:20,219 --> 00:38:21,719
Now we take a left back you up.

944
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,719
There's a boss up here.

945
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:23,119
Isn't it?

946
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:24,019
Let's go.

947
00:38:24,019 --> 00:38:25,019
There might be an item up here.

948
00:38:27,489 --> 00:38:28,590
Can you handle climbing this ladder?

949
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,920
We'll see you want me to go first.

950
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:33,420
I would like for you to go first.

951
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:42,900
We're all good.

952
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:45,800
Part of it was hoping that you were going to get sniped.

953
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:46,800
I am good.

954
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,400
Like if we go into a boss fight and you die, I am going to

955
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,099
try harder than I've ever tried of the game to like beat it

956
00:38:52,099 --> 00:38:52,599
anyway.

957
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,099
Just just so I can be the winner.

958
00:38:57,099 --> 00:38:57,599
That's fine.

959
00:38:58,539 --> 00:38:59,139
It's a good thing.

960
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:00,239
That's good.

961
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:05,340
So I may be completely incompetent, but I have the like

962
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,380
the burning desire and that usually works for anime.

963
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,050
Oh, okay.

964
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:18,650
Keep going.

965
00:39:19,389 --> 00:39:19,989
Let's do a race.

966
00:39:19,989 --> 00:39:20,489
Wait ready?

967
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:22,440
Hold on.

968
00:39:23,139 --> 00:39:23,639
We didn't do it.

969
00:39:24,699 --> 00:39:27,300
You're going to win any race because I'm going to jump

970
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,000
instead of run.

971
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,900
That's better jump.

972
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:34,440
It'll be funny jump.

973
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,559
I almost just did it.

974
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,460
I almost just did it.

975
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,659
I was thinking it was weird.

976
00:39:40,659 --> 00:39:42,159
My whole body was like I'm going to do it.

977
00:39:42,659 --> 00:39:43,860
Kill yourself.

978
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,559
I was like, I'm going to jump off that for no reason.

979
00:39:47,360 --> 00:40:01,980
Watch out that I thought he was going to walk off.

980
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,429
No, I'm here to game.

981
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:12,230
Are you going to stacking bonus for the amount of things

982
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:14,429
that you kill before returning to the shrine and praying?

983
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,380
So I like don't want to get hit.

984
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:28,789
Is that oh, that's a as a neo reference shout out.

985
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:35,099
I'm just going to brace the jumping.

986
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,400
Are we going uphill?

987
00:40:36,699 --> 00:40:37,099
Excuse me.

988
00:40:37,099 --> 00:40:39,599
I'm walking in my we have gone around like we need to turn

989
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:40,599
way to go like on the road.

990
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,110
I know.

991
00:40:45,909 --> 00:40:46,610
I got an epic.

992
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:47,809
Did you epic?

993
00:40:48,809 --> 00:40:49,210
Hold on.

994
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,510
I've got something that you are going to want to take a look

995
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:51,909
at.

996
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:55,480
I got the staff that I used a lot of the game.

997
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,579
It's really sick.

998
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:59,780
I don't I have every staff in the game and one spell.

999
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,679
I have gravity pole or whatever.

1000
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:04,079
But this one is the one that makes your spells cast way

1001
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:04,679
faster.

1002
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:07,579
This is the Azores glint stone staff.

1003
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:10,800
It reduces the casting it.

1004
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:12,000
All right.

1005
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,300
Yeah, you can climb that tower and throw it off.

1006
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,239
It's like just javelin it over the edge.

1007
00:41:20,739 --> 00:41:21,039
Yep.

1008
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:21,739
All right.

1009
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:24,300
All right.

1010
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:25,699
There's a boss up here.

1011
00:41:26,539 --> 00:41:27,539
Yeah, are you prepared?

1012
00:41:27,539 --> 00:41:30,139
Hell, well all the way over the top is normally the

1013
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:34,840
meteorite meteor man and for us, it's going to be redone

1014
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:36,130
now.

1015
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,230
It actually would be really bad if it was like Eldon Beast

1016
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,130
if it okay if Eldon Beast is in the middle of this.

1017
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:40,929
I'm going to wait.

1018
00:41:40,929 --> 00:41:41,929
You're just going to go to bed.

1019
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,659
I'm going to go to bed.

1020
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,659
No, I'm you're going to die and I'm going to focus so hard

1021
00:41:47,659 --> 00:41:50,260
and you're going to see me jump and cast stops barrier at

1022
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:50,760
nothing.

1023
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,559
But I'm still going to beat it.

1024
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,340
Okay, it's going to be you.

1025
00:41:55,539 --> 00:41:57,139
Oh my god, please don't say that.

1026
00:42:00,579 --> 00:42:01,179
Are you prepared?

1027
00:42:01,179 --> 00:42:01,480
Huh?

1028
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:02,719
Are you prepared?

1029
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:03,019
Huh?

1030
00:42:14,179 --> 00:42:15,579
I'm keep holding it.

1031
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:16,980
It's rough.

1032
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:17,780
I'm sorry.

1033
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:19,110
All right.

1034
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:22,010
I'll get over saying it soon.

1035
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,820
You're supposed to dodge roll in this game.

1036
00:42:36,019 --> 00:42:37,920
Okay, you know when you were asking me about Neo, I think

1037
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,320
this is actually the best comparison.

1038
00:42:39,619 --> 00:42:41,719
Your first couple hours are going to be like this.

1039
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:43,820
I'm dead.

1040
00:42:46,289 --> 00:42:49,090
I just saw you jump over that that actually helped you

1041
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:49,889
you jumped over it.

1042
00:42:49,889 --> 00:42:50,590
You didn't dodge it.

1043
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,039
Oh, I've got him now.

1044
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,150
Oh my god.

1045
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:58,550
We are so don't die.

1046
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:00,150
This is so fucking far away, dude.

1047
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:01,719
I can't die.

1048
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:03,210
Got him.

1049
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:06,739
Holy shit.

1050
00:43:06,739 --> 00:43:07,639
This is so far away.

1051
00:43:08,139 --> 00:43:08,440
Sorry.

1052
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,840
I looked over your chat stir not even helping the chimera

1053
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,440
is dead.

1054
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:16,699
Yeah, well you took you have like a legend next to your

1055
00:43:16,699 --> 00:43:19,500
computer of like all the buttons written down while I

1056
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,400
was dodging and attacking and fighting and he was kicking

1057
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,199
the shit out of me and you looked at your legend of moves

1058
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:26,699
you could do and then like 15 to 30 seconds later you

1059
00:43:26,699 --> 00:43:32,010
decided to help I kept there was a giant great wolf those

1060
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:33,409
wolves die in one hit.

1061
00:43:33,809 --> 00:43:35,010
No, that's one of the big wolves.

1062
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:35,809
It took a lot of hits.

1063
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,349
Are you climbing you coming back?

1064
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:40,849
I don't think you understand how far away I am.

1065
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:45,150
I am at the Gellmer's hero grave.

1066
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:46,550
That's the last bonfire we got.

1067
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:50,570
Oh, I thought there was a bonfire right here.

1068
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:52,230
Did you get it?

1069
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:52,929
Because I didn't get it.

1070
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:56,320
May just be up the hill a bit.

1071
00:43:56,619 --> 00:43:58,019
I know there's like a midway point.

1072
00:43:58,960 --> 00:43:59,960
All right, I'll be good.

1073
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:03,519
Okay, you'd better be good.

1074
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,610
I'm on my way this time.

1075
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:09,010
I'm just going to get right over there.

1076
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:14,699
No stopping at the maps.

1077
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:18,000
Yeah, that's I don't know that I think that might be a

1078
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,199
little much for stir right now.

1079
00:44:32,769 --> 00:44:39,619
We'll get this one at least and wait.

1080
00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:40,320
I've never played Elden ring.

1081
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,320
Can I get a spoiler warning?

1082
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:42,519
Oh shit.

1083
00:44:42,619 --> 00:44:42,920
Yep.

1084
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,900
Stir will write it on history.

1085
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:49,909
What does that mean?

1086
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:53,090
Someone was wanted a spoiler warning because they haven't

1087
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:54,690
played this part and I said that you would just put it

1088
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:55,090
on yours.

1089
00:44:55,969 --> 00:44:57,269
Okay, that's on mine.

1090
00:45:00,579 --> 00:45:02,980
My stream has the there's the twitch plug-in where anything

1091
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:04,980
that you haven't seen before in a game is covered with

1092
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:05,880
like a black box.

1093
00:45:06,989 --> 00:45:08,389
That's so stupid.

1094
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:16,360
Oh, the spoiler extension.

1095
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,360
Oh, hey, welcome back.

1096
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,760
I'm back good of you to show up and finally start helping.

1097
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:25,659
I know.

1098
00:45:27,219 --> 00:45:27,619
All right.

1099
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:29,420
So we just got to get her.

1100
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:31,219
I think there's a bonfire somewhere over here.

1101
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:36,940
I just finished making a cardboard cut out of you and

1102
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:38,239
watches me when I sleep.

1103
00:45:38,539 --> 00:45:39,739
That's not strange at all.

1104
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,420
I thought there was like another ladder here.

1105
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:52,010
You should jump you thought I was going to it's the last

1106
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:53,010
thing they would expect.

1107
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:55,579
All right, so we got it.

1108
00:45:55,579 --> 00:46:04,000
Let's go over this down here.

1109
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:04,300
All right.

1110
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:07,639
Well, I think we keep going on the ladders right the ladder

1111
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:07,940
right here.

1112
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:08,440
Right here.

1113
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:08,639
I know.

1114
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:08,840
I know.

1115
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:12,139
I know, but I think I think there's a bonfire though.

1116
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:13,239
I knew where to go.

1117
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:13,940
No, it's up here.

1118
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:14,940
You're wrong.

1119
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:19,099
I knew where to go with those coffee.

1120
00:46:19,099 --> 00:46:19,900
Drank is kicking in.

1121
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:23,960
I swear this one like right here.

1122
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:28,190
Yeah, I think it we are going to go up one more.

1123
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,500
Oh, this is just ladder zone.

1124
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:39,059
I like it.

1125
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:52,780
You need to help your friend.

1126
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:54,860
My friend.

1127
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:58,349
What I said you need to help your friend.

1128
00:47:00,059 --> 00:47:03,800
I'm beyond helping you need to help him.

1129
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:05,860
No.

1130
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:06,860
All right.

1131
00:47:07,059 --> 00:47:07,559
Watch out.

1132
00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:10,030
I think we yeah, we go.

1133
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:10,730
I can do it.

1134
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:12,030
I think you're all right.

1135
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:14,530
I think you just maybe were a little nervous that you had

1136
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:15,929
to relearn and get the game.

1137
00:47:23,389 --> 00:47:24,190
Everything seems fine.

1138
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:37,440
Do you have some enemies special enemies got some

1139
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,739
Herba do you need any Herba is already something like

1140
00:47:40,739 --> 00:47:41,940
shooting this from a mile away.

1141
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:44,929
Oh the flower beware.

1142
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:48,030
I thought that was actually like falling stars in the sky

1143
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:49,730
and I was like, oh, that's that's a cool environmental

1144
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:50,130
effect.

1145
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:50,929
I should grab me.

1146
00:47:50,929 --> 00:47:51,730
I thought I could hit it.

1147
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:53,630
You're so dead.

1148
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:56,630
You're I thought you were getting pelted by everything

1149
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:58,030
kind of was but I'm all right.

1150
00:47:58,730 --> 00:47:59,730
We fighting this.

1151
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:04,929
Oh, I mean no, but that's destructible.

1152
00:48:06,889 --> 00:48:08,190
This thing is that these things are so annoying.

1153
00:48:08,289 --> 00:48:08,889
I say no.

1154
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:15,179
Just get the heck out of here across the bridge and then

1155
00:48:15,179 --> 00:48:16,579
there's a bonfire right here.

1156
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,679
Yes, there is and then we fight whatever is up here.

1157
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:22,150
All right.

1158
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:24,250
Let's both take a guess and if one of us gets this right

1159
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:27,050
then we all the other one 50 bucks.

1160
00:48:28,369 --> 00:48:31,070
It's kind of weird that you like booted up your game early

1161
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:32,570
just to see what was up here pretend.

1162
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:37,070
You don't have any of these graces for $50.

1163
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:41,409
Yeah, I'm gonna all right.

1164
00:48:41,409 --> 00:48:43,610
I'm gonna say it's gonna be we haven't.

1165
00:48:43,809 --> 00:48:46,610
I'm just saying I've said for Don I don't think it would

1166
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:50,409
be it would be in the lore for him to be inside the crater

1167
00:48:50,809 --> 00:48:51,610
probability wise.

1168
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:54,409
We have not seen really that many ulcerated tree spirits

1169
00:48:54,409 --> 00:48:55,510
and there's like 10 in the game.

1170
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:59,869
So I'm going to say an ulcerated tree spirit statistically

1171
00:48:59,869 --> 00:49:00,170
speaking.

1172
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:01,269
That's where I have the most odds.

1173
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:13,590
It's oh that way that could have an urge tree avatar full

1174
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:15,590
grown or tree avatar though.

1175
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,460
Yeah, this is a safe bet to this in the ulcerated tree spirits.

1176
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,559
We've only seen like two of these.

1177
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:35,940
I know a lot of hell.

1178
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:48,210
Oh shit.

1179
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:49,909
I tried to dodge that didn't time it right.

1180
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:56,360
That was weird.

1181
00:49:57,159 --> 00:49:58,559
That was really weird.

1182
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:02,469
I did not appreciate it.

1183
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,260
You know that you you dodge faster if you're in low stance.

1184
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:10,340
What the fuck did I just get?

1185
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:14,539
Yeah, I got a I got a weapon blue feathered branch sword.

1186
00:50:15,139 --> 00:50:16,340
I've never seen this item.

1187
00:50:20,929 --> 00:50:22,030
Are you going to take a look at this?

1188
00:50:25,739 --> 00:50:26,440
That's pretty rare.

1189
00:50:42,329 --> 00:50:44,429
Well, you thought he was drinking a flask?

1190
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:53,730
His staff on my screen went like behind his body.

1191
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:55,929
So it just looks like he put his hand to his empty head.

1192
00:50:55,929 --> 00:50:56,829
I was like he's drinking.

1193
00:50:56,829 --> 00:50:57,530
God damn it.

1194
00:50:57,530 --> 00:50:58,530
I don't want him to heal.

1195
00:50:58,530 --> 00:51:00,329
That would be so funny if they could do that.

1196
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:02,059
All right.

1197
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,260
Hold on a minute.

1198
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:04,960
What did I just get?

1199
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,960
I got like a weird rare key thing.

1200
00:51:09,019 --> 00:51:09,719
Is it a weapon?

1201
00:51:11,659 --> 00:51:12,659
I think I got a pot.

1202
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,360
Was that actually a sword?

1203
00:51:16,579 --> 00:51:17,280
What the hell was there?

1204
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:19,980
It's a talisman.

1205
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:27,679
Raises defense when HP is low.

1206
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,599
And then the other one was a talisman too, wasn't it?

1207
00:51:34,519 --> 00:51:35,519
What the hell was that other thing?

1208
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:40,130
Did I get this thing?

1209
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,599
I think we're in the fire zone though.

1210
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,800
I think I'm all right with this.

1211
00:51:50,949 --> 00:51:52,449
Omen burn.

1212
00:51:52,949 --> 00:51:53,650
Oh, yeah.

1213
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:54,449
I think it's a key though.

1214
00:51:54,949 --> 00:51:55,949
I don't even know what that thing does.

1215
00:51:55,949 --> 00:51:56,449
All right, cool.

1216
00:51:56,849 --> 00:52:00,550
I know that we're looking for like smithing stone fives.

1217
00:52:00,949 --> 00:52:02,349
It's my my breakpoint.

1218
00:52:02,449 --> 00:52:02,849
Hey.

1219
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:09,219
Just want to let you know what take a look what's on the ground.

1220
00:52:10,019 --> 00:52:10,719
No, seven.

1221
00:52:10,719 --> 00:52:12,719
I do smithing seven on the ground.

1222
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:14,659
Yeah.

1223
00:52:14,659 --> 00:52:15,659
No, I need sevens.

1224
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:18,360
Oh, I thought I was helping you and have those back.

1225
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:21,889
No, let's go.

1226
00:52:22,289 --> 00:52:22,789
Are we going?

1227
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:23,989
How do we get to Volcano Manor?

1228
00:52:23,989 --> 00:52:24,190
All right.

1229
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:25,789
Now we continue this way.

1230
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,480
We have to go over like here.

1231
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,480
Oh, yeah, there's like a walkway over here.

1232
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,940
It's not it's like over here.

1233
00:52:46,989 --> 00:52:51,019
Old needle gravity stone fans.

1234
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:51,920
Oh, yeah.

1235
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,460
So you said you do not care at all about about magic anything,

1236
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:56,760
right?

1237
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:04,250
I would like some magic to cast potentially because I have a

1238
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:08,699
couple of talismans that you probably want to have smithing

1239
00:53:08,699 --> 00:53:09,400
stone sevens.

1240
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,000
Maybe I do.

1241
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:14,090
I feel like you looked a bunch of times last dream and didn't

1242
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:15,929
take a look on the ground.

1243
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,539
Oh shit.

1244
00:53:24,539 --> 00:53:26,039
Who's your who's your favorite friend?

1245
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:28,559
I see you.

1246
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:29,659
Okay.

1247
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:30,159
Yep.

1248
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:32,960
No, no one else has given me smithing stone sevens, dude.

1249
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,460
You just got frenzy flamed by the three fingers.

1250
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:39,659
You just got fucking three fingered bro.

1251
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:49,710
No, that's an e3 fucking presentation.

1252
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:53,210
This is the e3 co-op presentation.

1253
00:53:53,809 --> 00:53:57,010
Dude, you got three frenzy fingered by the three fingers.

1254
00:53:57,309 --> 00:54:00,010
Whatever the fuck you said that was the e3 presentation.

1255
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:04,679
You watch out you're gonna get frenzied by the three fingers.

1256
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:07,380
You're just trying to distract from the fact that I don't know

1257
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:09,179
any of the buttons and you've died more times.

1258
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,380
Yeah, but I have to like help you.

1259
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:14,980
I have to like guide somebody is lagging the game by the way.

1260
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:17,880
Somebody there's like DDoS.

1261
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:22,239
No, there's another one of those like look over here and the

1262
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:25,539
game goes to 10 FPS creatures like a like a look at me.

1263
00:54:26,039 --> 00:54:27,239
Yeah, there's a look at me.

1264
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:28,239
All right.

1265
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:29,340
Let's are you are we going?

1266
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,599
Are we wait?

1267
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,199
I'm not the one who got three fingered.

1268
00:54:37,329 --> 00:54:42,630
You being like delirious tired is making me delirious tired

1269
00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:44,130
and I had a full night's sleep.

1270
00:54:44,329 --> 00:54:46,429
I had like avocado tacos.

1271
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:48,829
I had like a nice coffee.

1272
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:50,829
I have a foot fully hydrated.

1273
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,130
I'm fully well rested.

1274
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:54,929
You're turning me sleep-deprived.

1275
00:54:56,099 --> 00:55:00,000
I wish I had a knob that I could turn and just become sleepy

1276
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,400
or like, you know, like a mood controller.

1277
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,599
I wish I was a robot.

1278
00:55:04,099 --> 00:55:09,360
You know, I'd sell my soul to Ubisoft and they could plug me

1279
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:12,460
in, you know, how just how amazing that would actually be

1280
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:14,960
if you could truly control just like, you know what?

1281
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,059
It's time for me to go to bed.

1282
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:19,159
I can like go up into my internal like hard drive up here

1283
00:55:19,159 --> 00:55:22,960
and be like turn off and turn back on actually every terrible

1284
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,360
what if like it was like an emergency yourself.

1285
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:27,730
Yeah, I need a quick reboot guys.

1286
00:55:27,829 --> 00:55:30,030
Yeah, my like Wi-Fi is off.

1287
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:37,429
I could go for some like mind control slash like invasion

1288
00:55:37,429 --> 00:55:40,230
of privacy like give up all my data type of situation

1289
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:43,829
if it meant that I could be sleepy when I want to.

1290
00:55:47,289 --> 00:55:48,389
It's an avocado taco.

1291
00:55:48,389 --> 00:55:49,289
It's just a taco.

1292
00:55:50,489 --> 00:55:53,090
Like I would take the risk that the communists could totally

1293
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:58,289
like activate me at any time as a soldier if it meant that

1294
00:55:58,289 --> 00:56:01,190
I could like control my my being.

1295
00:56:02,429 --> 00:56:04,730
It's like I know the communists.

1296
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:05,929
All right.

1297
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:11,059
Isn't it one of these illusory wall eventually all the way

1298
00:56:11,059 --> 00:56:12,659
down at the end here.

1299
00:56:15,219 --> 00:56:16,920
You have to go in one of the rooms because you can't even

1300
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,019
I think we have to talk first.

1301
00:56:18,019 --> 00:56:19,420
We have to like say, yes, we're here.

1302
00:56:23,139 --> 00:56:24,239
Well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

1303
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:24,440
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

1304
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,039
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

1305
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:31,079
this is the guy upstairs who drops the thing if we could go

1306
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:32,980
kill the guy and see if he drops on Elsa.

1307
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:34,079
I don't know if you want to do that.

1308
00:56:34,579 --> 00:56:35,480
I like this outfit.

1309
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:36,880
You got to join the manor.

1310
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:38,579
All right.

1311
00:56:38,579 --> 00:56:39,579
So we join the manor.

1312
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,480
She gave me two golden seeds.

1313
00:56:41,579 --> 00:56:42,380
Join the manor.

1314
00:56:43,179 --> 00:56:44,079
I'm having twins.

1315
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,079
And a bell bearing.

1316
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:49,280
Nice.

1317
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:49,679
All right.

1318
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:50,679
And then we go upstairs.

1319
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:51,579
Yeah.

1320
00:56:51,579 --> 00:56:53,380
And there is that person to fight.

1321
00:56:54,579 --> 00:56:55,079
It goes

1322
00:56:58,980 --> 00:56:59,980
just like Bloodborne.

1323
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,280
You get invaded.

1324
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,019
Oh, Amidala or whatever.

1325
00:57:07,019 --> 00:57:08,320
He says, you know,

1326
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:13,320
Oh, Amidala, have mercy on the poor boy.

1327
00:57:14,469 --> 00:57:16,170
Of course, for some reason.

1328
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:20,059
Have mercy on the poor bastard.

1329
00:57:20,059 --> 00:57:20,760
I think that's what it is.

1330
00:57:26,019 --> 00:57:27,219
Why this?

1331
00:57:28,119 --> 00:57:30,320
This guy has like 10 million health.

1332
00:57:31,619 --> 00:57:32,320
What is going on?

1333
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:34,869
It has a lot of health.

1334
00:57:34,969 --> 00:57:37,070
No, it's being healed.

1335
00:57:38,429 --> 00:57:40,829
Oh, because he seems to have the beast magic.

1336
00:57:40,929 --> 00:57:42,130
There's a beast heal.

1337
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:43,530
I'm just seriously jumping everything.

1338
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:44,030
Magic.

1339
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:45,969
Beast magic.

1340
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:48,539
Can't hit me.

1341
00:57:48,539 --> 00:57:49,440
I'm a jumper now.

1342
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:53,599
Why is my stamina going down when I keep hold?

1343
00:57:54,099 --> 00:57:55,000
I've helped.

1344
00:57:55,869 --> 00:57:56,570
You're not helping.

1345
00:57:57,170 --> 00:57:59,070
All the help that's been taken off in the last 15 straight

1346
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:00,269
seconds has been me, not you.

1347
00:58:02,389 --> 00:58:03,590
I'm doubting that.

1348
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:06,789
Oh, dude, look at that.

1349
00:58:08,519 --> 00:58:08,920
Wait, wait, wait.

1350
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:09,519
I'm going to use it.

1351
00:58:10,519 --> 00:58:10,820
Ready?

1352
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:11,420
Oh, you're good.

1353
00:58:11,619 --> 00:58:12,920
Oh, you're going to want to take a look at this.

1354
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:15,889
Yes.

1355
00:58:16,389 --> 00:58:17,889
You just clean yourself with soap.

1356
00:58:17,889 --> 00:58:18,190
Yeah.

1357
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:32,650
First shower in months.

1358
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:32,949
Yeah.

1359
00:58:37,079 --> 00:58:37,280
Okay.

1360
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,079
So now we wait a minute.

1361
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:48,929
Don't get mad.

1362
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:49,829
I was very excited.

1363
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:52,030
Okay.

1364
00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:55,630
So the door should be open technically now, right?

1365
00:58:56,429 --> 00:58:57,130
One second.

1366
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:02,860
No.

1367
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:03,360
Oh, this one is.

1368
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:09,730
Do you have to come back?

1369
00:59:12,110 --> 00:59:15,210
No, you got to, you know, yeah.

1370
00:59:16,309 --> 00:59:16,909
We do.

1371
00:59:16,909 --> 00:59:18,110
I think we have to reload the area.

1372
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:20,980
Oh, you might be right.

1373
00:59:23,869 --> 00:59:25,570
You didn't get the drawing room key.

1374
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:27,469
We don't have the key to get in here.

1375
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:30,139
Oh, right.

1376
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,539
She does give a key.

1377
00:59:34,539 --> 00:59:35,139
Oh, yeah.

1378
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:37,039
So we don't have it.

1379
00:59:37,239 --> 00:59:38,139
So now what?

1380
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:45,190
That's a good question.

1381
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:48,559
I know there's multiple ways to get in there.

1382
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:49,360
There's a different week.

1383
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,059
I think we can go like around here.

1384
00:59:52,039 --> 00:59:52,739
Let's get the map.

1385
00:59:57,639 --> 00:59:58,739
I think we can go around the whole thing.

1386
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:06,750
Take the teleporter at the bottom of Ray Lucaria.

1387
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:08,050
We did that.

1388
01:00:08,349 --> 01:00:09,250
Yeah, we did that.

1389
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:11,150
But were we supposed to go a different way from there?

1390
01:00:18,409 --> 01:00:21,210
Yeah, we got we got killed at the bottom and we we have a

1391
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:22,409
teleporter down there.

1392
01:00:22,409 --> 01:00:23,809
Is it safe to drop down here?

1393
01:00:27,469 --> 01:00:27,969
No.

1394
01:00:30,219 --> 01:00:33,679
Oh, I want to do it so bad.

1395
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:34,579
I'm just so lazy.

1396
01:00:38,349 --> 01:00:39,050
It's too far.

1397
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:39,750
I was testing it.

1398
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:43,239
That was a good test.

1399
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:44,039
I'll wait.

1400
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:56,000
Ready?

1401
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:56,800
Be careful.

1402
01:00:58,159 --> 01:01:01,199
I am ready.

1403
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:02,099
Be careful.

1404
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:06,719
But that's how it went for you every time too, right?

1405
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:09,510
I can't remember.

1406
01:01:11,690 --> 01:01:18,679
Give Bloodborne on PC with a new DLC and a bunch of new weapons.

1407
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:25,440
Oh, that's so that's one of the so-called fall jokes.

1408
01:01:25,639 --> 01:01:26,639
Interesting.

1409
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:30,329
Are you studying my stream?

1410
01:01:32,219 --> 01:01:33,420
Why are you studying me?

1411
01:01:35,699 --> 01:01:37,199
Well, apparently you're interesting.

1412
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:39,099
There's a replacement German every now and again.

1413
01:01:40,369 --> 01:01:42,269
Interesting writing notes.

1414
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:45,909
Okay, so I gotta go a long way.

1415
01:01:46,610 --> 01:01:47,110
Fine.

1416
01:01:48,809 --> 01:01:52,110
You still haven't killed any of these invisible dung beetles.

1417
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:53,010
I haven't.

1418
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:55,309
I haven't killed any of them.

1419
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:56,610
This one is so easy.

1420
01:01:56,610 --> 01:01:57,010
Isn't it?

1421
01:01:57,710 --> 01:01:59,309
Let's get it because it could be something cool.

1422
01:02:01,949 --> 01:02:03,550
Well, you're you're lingering flame.

1423
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:04,349
You put on the ground.

1424
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:06,650
You could just like put that in the path.

1425
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:08,050
That's a good idea.

1426
01:02:15,869 --> 01:02:20,590
Where is it going around you coming down here?

1427
01:02:28,099 --> 01:02:28,599
You missed.

1428
01:02:29,530 --> 01:02:42,389
Oh, it's just like impossible is like one pixel.

1429
01:03:06,409 --> 01:03:08,610
Oh, that's why you do it.

1430
01:03:09,010 --> 01:03:10,210
That's why you do it.

1431
01:03:10,409 --> 01:03:11,610
That's why you do it.

1432
01:03:12,619 --> 01:03:13,619
I just got the black knife.

1433
01:03:15,289 --> 01:03:16,590
I've had that you're lame.

1434
01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:19,190
I got Elden ring the Elden boss remembrance.

1435
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:20,789
You've got the Elden beast remembrance.

1436
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:21,489
Yeah.

1437
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:23,090
Ooh, see it was worth it.

1438
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:24,789
Now if we didn't do that you what's worth it.

1439
01:03:24,889 --> 01:03:33,730
See you can also jump across the volcano Manor interior from

1440
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:36,429
the place you get teleported to if you do a running jump.

1441
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:37,630
Really?

1442
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:43,739
Let's see what happens when we go this way.

1443
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:45,750
What's going on?

1444
01:03:53,489 --> 01:03:54,789
I got another smithing stone 7.

1445
01:03:55,949 --> 01:03:58,349
Oh, yeah, I can get big pluses.

1446
01:03:58,349 --> 01:03:58,949
Give it to me.

1447
01:03:59,050 --> 01:04:00,050
Give it to me now.

1448
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:01,050
Drop it.

1449
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:02,650
There's no opportunity to do that.

1450
01:04:02,650 --> 01:04:04,250
We're trying to get the map piece.

1451
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:05,550
You're trying.

1452
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:06,949
I know what the map looks like already.

1453
01:04:06,949 --> 01:04:07,750
No, you don't.

1454
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:10,349
I've got fucking IGN calm open.

1455
01:04:13,949 --> 01:04:14,449
I drop it.

1456
01:04:14,449 --> 01:04:15,949
There's there's a boss down here.

1457
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:22,880
There is it was patched.

1458
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:30,039
Oh, I should let me wait a minute.

1459
01:04:32,829 --> 01:04:36,440
Hold on this 35,000 souls on the ground.

1460
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,739
I think over here that I yeah, I'll be right back.

1461
01:04:40,039 --> 01:04:42,039
Yeah, that adds up because we killed that boss.

1462
01:04:42,139 --> 01:04:48,150
Yeah, where the fuck is it?

1463
01:04:48,449 --> 01:04:49,349
Is it where I fell?

1464
01:04:50,619 --> 01:04:52,719
It's kind of strange that you left without giving me the

1465
01:04:52,719 --> 01:04:53,619
smithing stone.

1466
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:55,019
I'll be right back.

1467
01:04:56,019 --> 01:04:58,320
I feel like that's kind of selfish and you're showing

1468
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,119
a side of yourself.

1469
01:04:59,219 --> 01:05:00,920
I didn't know existed and I don't like it.

1470
01:05:01,219 --> 01:05:02,219
We'll fucking deal with it.

1471
01:05:04,579 --> 01:05:05,280
How's that sound?

1472
01:05:07,909 --> 01:05:09,909
Yeah, I'm glad people finally got a glimpse of what you're

1473
01:05:09,909 --> 01:05:11,909
really like during the Christmas stream.

1474
01:05:12,809 --> 01:05:13,909
No, you're being recorded.

1475
01:05:16,059 --> 01:05:16,860
Where are these?

1476
01:05:17,059 --> 01:05:17,760
Where are they?

1477
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,800
Oh, yeah, that would have been awful.

1478
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,000
That's 35,000 souls.

1479
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:22,599
There's a lot.

1480
01:05:24,239 --> 01:05:24,840
I'll come back.

1481
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:39,760
I will drop the stone.

1482
01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:42,530
Well, then we have to we got to travel.

1483
01:05:43,130 --> 01:05:43,829
We have to move.

1484
01:05:45,019 --> 01:05:46,320
Into where I can Smith.

1485
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:48,530
Okay, we can get that.

1486
01:05:48,530 --> 01:05:50,329
I need my smithing.

1487
01:05:52,099 --> 01:05:52,400
Okay.

1488
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:57,500
Here is the do you have any somber smithing stone?

1489
01:05:57,599 --> 01:05:58,599
Eights by chance.

1490
01:05:59,699 --> 01:06:03,000
I believe I do actually if you like something I recall having

1491
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
in my inventory.

1492
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,500
Let me one briefly moment.

1493
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,800
Take a yonder look over into my sombers.

1494
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:08,500
I have an eight.

1495
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:10,400
Dude, then here we go.

1496
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:12,300
This is fucking perfect.

1497
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:13,599
I discard.

1498
01:06:16,409 --> 01:06:17,809
Wait, which was which one?

1499
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:22,110
Okay, I'll just you know, we just picked them both up.

1500
01:06:22,110 --> 01:06:22,510
All right.

1501
01:06:23,349 --> 01:06:24,150
I'm putting mine over here.

1502
01:06:28,090 --> 01:06:30,329
Okay, I can go to plus nine now.

1503
01:06:30,429 --> 01:06:32,030
So now we're going to be unstoppable.

1504
01:06:33,539 --> 01:06:35,440
We are going to be genuinely unstoppable.

1505
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,320
Now, let's go Smith.

1506
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:56,199
Where is there is actually fucking insane true.

1507
01:06:56,699 --> 01:06:57,400
I don't think so.

1508
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:01,510
Oh, cuz you want to be like the insane guy.

1509
01:07:01,510 --> 01:07:03,110
I'm taking like street cut away from you.

1510
01:07:04,199 --> 01:07:13,719
I was saying to my child, I don't even remember what I was

1511
01:07:13,719 --> 01:07:16,670
saying that you're like, I don't know.

1512
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:17,670
You're trying to I don't know.

1513
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:19,570
There's a conspiracy where you're trying to poison me, but

1514
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:21,969
it backfired because it made me weirder like you want it

1515
01:07:21,969 --> 01:07:22,670
to be weird.

1516
01:07:23,730 --> 01:07:24,329
I don't know.

1517
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:26,650
Are you talking about?

1518
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:31,250
There's a conspiracy that I poisoned you.

1519
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:35,880
Yeah, what's oh explain this conspiracy there that I poisoned

1520
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:38,179
you last time we played Elden Ring.

1521
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:40,619
You're like damn stirs like kind of funny.

1522
01:07:40,619 --> 01:07:42,619
Like I feel like I'm losing some cred to him.

1523
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:43,519
When we're like co-op.

1524
01:07:43,519 --> 01:07:46,320
Oh, I thought you meant like there was a point in the last

1525
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:49,019
like decade that we've known each other or I just trying

1526
01:07:49,019 --> 01:07:49,920
to poison you.

1527
01:07:50,119 --> 01:07:50,519
Oh, okay.

1528
01:07:50,519 --> 01:07:51,820
No, just last week.

1529
01:07:52,719 --> 01:07:54,519
Yeah, just last week when I hold on a minute.

1530
01:07:54,519 --> 01:07:56,719
I got I'm almost a plus 10 with this thing.

1531
01:07:57,230 --> 01:07:58,630
This thing is beefy now.

1532
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,960
Do you have any of the ancient dragon smithing stones?

1533
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:06,559
Some of the ones you actually have one of those.

1534
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,559
Yeah, I'm plus 25 on my sword.

1535
01:08:08,659 --> 01:08:11,059
They would give me that somber ancient dragon smithing

1536
01:08:11,059 --> 01:08:11,360
stone.

1537
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:12,460
I will be plus 10.

1538
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:14,460
Mine's mine's a hollow here.

1539
01:08:28,119 --> 01:08:28,819
What are you giving me?

1540
01:08:30,270 --> 01:08:31,270
Better not be a staff.

1541
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:43,890
Hello.

1542
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:48,979
Thank you.

1543
01:08:48,979 --> 01:08:51,479
Yeah, I treated you would know that has sentimental value.

1544
01:08:51,579 --> 01:08:55,329
It does me strong just traded you his club.

1545
01:08:56,069 --> 01:08:57,869
That's something that that's that's a trinket.

1546
01:08:57,869 --> 01:09:01,340
That's worth isn't isn't a club.

1547
01:09:02,039 --> 01:09:07,670
Just a staff plus 10.

1548
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:08,270
Let's go.

1549
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:12,979
I mean, that's something that that holds incredible like

1550
01:09:12,979 --> 01:09:15,880
generational sentimental family value and I just let I just

1551
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:16,279
gave it to you.

1552
01:09:18,199 --> 01:09:18,699
It's wrong.

1553
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:19,600
Club.

1554
01:09:20,529 --> 01:09:22,329
Okay, where we're going get back to where we were.

1555
01:09:22,329 --> 01:09:23,229
There's a boss there.

1556
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:28,159
Yes, I don't remember the name of it.

1557
01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:31,449
It was I was up here.

1558
01:09:31,449 --> 01:09:36,050
It was the ninth Mount Gelmere campsite.

1559
01:09:37,229 --> 01:09:41,359
You sure I think it's the road of let's let's get this

1560
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:43,359
right because if we can't get in there with the key,

1561
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:46,359
what is the best way for us to get there because we can't

1562
01:09:46,359 --> 01:09:48,159
go to the manor because it's randomized.

1563
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:49,659
So we can't open the door.

1564
01:09:49,659 --> 01:09:52,859
So how the fuck do we do this go to Seathwater terminus?

1565
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:56,800
That's there that has that that has that has to be it.

1566
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:57,800
And also, I don't know.

1567
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,500
Apparently, we have to go through Ray Lucaria.

1568
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,100
We cannot get there any other way.

1569
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:02,600
We did that.

1570
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,300
So we should have the way points from down there.

1571
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:05,500
So we did that.

1572
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:07,399
So let's get back down there.

1573
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:11,000
Wherever that is was it subterranean inquisition Chamber

1574
01:10:11,470 --> 01:10:18,380
should be this pre-recorded.

1575
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:19,859
Why would it?

1576
01:10:19,859 --> 01:10:23,039
Why would it be you managed to stir?

1577
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:24,739
If I was like, hey dude, like I don't really feel like

1578
01:10:24,739 --> 01:10:26,840
streaming tomorrow, but like let's like scream for like

1579
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:28,939
seven hours right now, like pretend and then I'll just

1580
01:10:28,939 --> 01:10:29,739
upload it tomorrow.

1581
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:35,420
I thought about doing that a few times never done it.

1582
01:10:37,779 --> 01:10:40,149
Something about it's funny to me that I could be sitting

1583
01:10:40,149 --> 01:10:42,250
there watching my own stream and like laughing and

1584
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:45,880
enjoying my stream with everyone else.

1585
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:48,579
You got a stream on an alt channel of me watching my

1586
01:10:48,579 --> 01:10:49,979
stream reacting to my stream.

1587
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:53,979
I guess we have to jump from here from the teleport.

1588
01:10:56,979 --> 01:10:58,579
Are you going to do a jungle gym stream?

1589
01:11:06,779 --> 01:11:07,680
Who said hello?

1590
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,779
Oh, I don't people look like that's people.

1591
01:11:09,779 --> 01:11:11,479
Okay, I have no idea who that was.

1592
01:11:13,039 --> 01:11:14,579
Wow, that's a diss.

1593
01:11:14,579 --> 01:11:15,479
You don't know who that was.

1594
01:11:16,539 --> 01:11:17,039
I don't know.

1595
01:11:18,039 --> 01:11:18,640
What do you mean?

1596
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:19,239
I feel bad.

1597
01:11:19,539 --> 01:11:21,840
Wait, I wasn't even paying attention plate again.

1598
01:11:22,729 --> 01:11:23,729
I can't it's random.

1599
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:25,579
Hello.

1600
01:11:27,079 --> 01:11:28,680
That was not the same person that just did that.

1601
01:11:28,779 --> 01:11:29,279
Exactly.

1602
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:29,979
That's what I mean.

1603
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:31,079
You don't get a redo.

1604
01:11:34,189 --> 01:11:36,289
Okay, so we're not in the right spot.

1605
01:11:37,090 --> 01:11:39,590
I think we have to get to where we get to ported to and

1606
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:41,390
then jump from where we get ported to.

1607
01:11:43,949 --> 01:11:45,050
Well, that was further up.

1608
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:49,239
Have you played this before?

1609
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:52,539
Yeah, but I've like had the key to open the door to the

1610
01:11:52,539 --> 01:11:55,340
manor not jumping from a weird port and breaking all of

1611
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:56,039
my characters.

1612
01:11:56,039 --> 01:11:58,640
Okay, like legs and then I lose all my souls.

1613
01:11:58,939 --> 01:12:03,539
I haven't played this before and I don't know game is

1614
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:06,039
like enemy placements are like really weird.

1615
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:06,640
Okay.

1616
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:10,340
So where do where's that spot that we are at when we

1617
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:11,939
teleport here from Ray Lucario?

1618
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:16,630
That's where we need to go and we need to jump from a

1619
01:12:16,630 --> 01:12:20,229
spot there to get into the manor which is cheating by

1620
01:12:20,229 --> 01:12:20,630
the way.

1621
01:12:21,029 --> 01:12:22,529
Oh, I know what you're talking about.

1622
01:12:22,829 --> 01:12:24,729
I am I am with it.

1623
01:12:25,029 --> 01:12:25,630
So where is it?

1624
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:30,800
I am we have to actually get eat.

1625
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,100
We have to get eaten again.

1626
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:35,380
We may have to get eaten again people have keep saying

1627
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:37,180
patched, but we don't really have very many options.

1628
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:40,449
Do we why did they patch everything fun in this game?

1629
01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:48,489
Oh true wielding jumping attack and patched so bleed

1630
01:12:48,890 --> 01:12:49,489
patched.

1631
01:12:49,789 --> 01:12:54,289
So if it is patched then can we just not do right card

1632
01:12:54,289 --> 01:12:57,930
and we just have to just keep going ignore them.

1633
01:12:57,930 --> 01:12:59,229
We're going we go again.

1634
01:12:59,229 --> 01:13:03,130
Okay, so we have to go do that Ray Lucario skip again.

1635
01:13:04,579 --> 01:13:05,180
Yeah, sure.

1636
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:07,880
So that we have to go die down there again, which I'm

1637
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:10,279
going to lose 22,000 souls by the way.

1638
01:13:10,279 --> 01:13:11,579
23,000 souls.

1639
01:13:13,130 --> 01:13:13,930
No, I'm not.

1640
01:13:17,859 --> 01:13:19,659
I'm going to how much is it to level up?

1641
01:13:23,949 --> 01:13:24,649
You're a baller.

1642
01:13:24,649 --> 01:13:25,449
That's nothing to you.

1643
01:13:25,550 --> 01:13:26,850
I don't want to lose them.

1644
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:32,619
I have a briefcase full of money.

1645
01:13:32,619 --> 01:13:34,520
I'm not just going to like open it up and dump it on like

1646
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:36,319
the fucking just side of the road.

1647
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:37,520
This is like, oh, yeah, dude.

1648
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:38,119
I'm a baller.

1649
01:13:38,119 --> 01:13:38,819
I don't care.

1650
01:13:39,119 --> 01:13:41,920
Just like yeah, ban out like a million bucks on the fucking

1651
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:42,420
road.

1652
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:45,020
I think they're also saying patches gives you something

1653
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:48,220
but I think that item would be randomized use a twig.

1654
01:13:50,850 --> 01:13:51,750
Oh, I do have those.

1655
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:52,449
That's a good idea.

1656
01:13:56,710 --> 01:13:57,710
Where are those things?

1657
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,000
Oh, it's a talisman, right?

1658
01:14:05,670 --> 01:14:06,069
Okay.

1659
01:14:06,369 --> 01:14:07,670
I'm ready to do whatever you want to do.

1660
01:14:07,670 --> 01:14:08,170
Let's go.

1661
01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:11,140
Are we in combat?

1662
01:14:13,229 --> 01:14:15,199
No, it says I'm in combat.

1663
01:14:15,939 --> 01:14:16,739
Oh, it does.

1664
01:14:20,939 --> 01:14:21,939
Well, then we're going.

1665
01:14:21,939 --> 01:14:23,039
Are we doing Ray of Lucario?

1666
01:14:23,039 --> 01:14:35,949
We have to do that and then we go to the schoolhouse classroom.

1667
01:14:35,949 --> 01:14:36,949
This is such bullshit.

1668
01:14:36,949 --> 01:14:40,350
Like why didn't they like think to make the game like completely

1669
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:42,449
accessible to people that are like breaking it and like using

1670
01:14:42,449 --> 01:14:44,850
like fucking mods and cheats on it to ruin the whole thing

1671
01:14:44,850 --> 01:14:47,149
and like randomize everything like they didn't they didn't

1672
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:50,050
think about that before they made the game is that bug where

1673
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:53,850
you like block a few times and backstep and teleport across

1674
01:14:53,850 --> 01:14:55,949
the whole map is that still in I don't know.

1675
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:59,560
It was a speedrun that could beat this game in like two or

1676
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:00,760
three minutes right because of that.

1677
01:15:03,989 --> 01:15:05,989
I don't know if it was that fast, but they did get pretty

1678
01:15:05,989 --> 01:15:07,189
it was pretty damn fast.

1679
01:15:07,189 --> 01:15:08,189
It was like less than five minutes.

1680
01:15:08,189 --> 01:15:10,930
I think eventually no.

1681
01:15:10,930 --> 01:15:11,229
Yes.

1682
01:15:11,229 --> 01:15:11,529
No.

1683
01:15:11,529 --> 01:15:12,829
Yes, no one.

1684
01:15:13,130 --> 01:15:17,630
I mean if that's still in and we can't jump across a ledge

1685
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:19,619
and that's all I'm saying.

1686
01:15:19,619 --> 01:15:20,319
That's all I'm saying.

1687
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:23,319
I got to say somebody I was watching you play Neo for a

1688
01:15:23,319 --> 01:15:25,819
little bit the first time you played it and I already said

1689
01:15:25,819 --> 01:15:27,920
this on my stream, but I have to say it because it was on

1690
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:28,720
your stream.

1691
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:32,000
Somebody had an amazing comment on your stream.

1692
01:15:33,109 --> 01:15:35,109
You were trying to learn the game and you haven't like

1693
01:15:35,109 --> 01:15:38,439
trouble and you like all the buttons were so hard to

1694
01:15:38,439 --> 01:15:40,939
remember and just get to getting used to it and somebody

1695
01:15:40,939 --> 01:15:42,140
wrote dude.

1696
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:42,840
Don't worry.

1697
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:44,340
Once you get the buttons down.

1698
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:47,539
You're going to make it rain on this guy like a boss.

1699
01:15:47,539 --> 01:15:51,039
They said like everything that you had said the other day in

1700
01:15:51,039 --> 01:15:51,939
one sentence.

1701
01:15:51,939 --> 01:15:53,340
It was like one paragraph.

1702
01:15:53,939 --> 01:15:55,039
It was I like loved it.

1703
01:15:55,039 --> 01:15:56,340
It was like my favorite comment.

1704
01:15:57,039 --> 01:15:57,539
You don't worry.

1705
01:15:57,539 --> 01:15:59,939
Once you learn the buttons, you're going to make it rain

1706
01:15:59,939 --> 01:16:03,039
on this guy and then like a boss.

1707
01:16:03,039 --> 01:16:04,640
You'll take down the next enemy.

1708
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:06,340
It was just like perfectly crafted.

1709
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:07,579
All right.

1710
01:16:07,579 --> 01:16:08,680
That is how it happened.

1711
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:10,619
So we're going back down.

1712
01:16:17,119 --> 01:16:17,619
Shut up.

1713
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:20,560
Once I learned the buttons this game.

1714
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:21,460
I'm going to do it too.

1715
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:29,640
You coming are you I'm coming down right now.

1716
01:16:30,140 --> 01:16:31,140
I'm coming down right now.

1717
01:16:31,239 --> 01:16:43,960
I was killing the hand just go just going down a lot of

1718
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:46,729
ladders and elevators today.

1719
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:50,979
Okay.

1720
01:16:50,979 --> 01:16:52,680
So is it still work?

1721
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:53,880
We just die down here, right?

1722
01:16:56,229 --> 01:16:56,529
Yep.

1723
01:16:56,930 --> 01:16:57,529
Just die.

1724
01:16:57,529 --> 01:16:58,029
Okay.

1725
01:16:58,329 --> 01:16:59,329
Hey, you pretty good at that.

1726
01:16:59,430 --> 01:16:59,630
Actually.

1727
01:16:59,630 --> 01:16:59,930
Hold on.

1728
01:16:59,930 --> 01:17:01,029
Let me pick up that item.

1729
01:17:01,029 --> 01:17:01,630
I never got.

1730
01:17:07,670 --> 01:17:13,479
Oh, right here.

1731
01:17:14,079 --> 01:17:14,680
Right here.

1732
01:17:25,289 --> 01:17:25,989
This guy sucks.

1733
01:17:29,229 --> 01:17:30,329
Why is it always like this?

1734
01:17:31,029 --> 01:17:33,229
Yeah, these things murder you if you fight them.

1735
01:17:33,329 --> 01:17:33,630
Yeah.

1736
01:17:33,930 --> 01:17:47,539
If you actually play the game fight them minus 26 K.

1737
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:48,039
Nope.

1738
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:49,539
I put on the talisman.

1739
01:17:56,140 --> 01:17:56,539
Okay.

1740
01:17:58,119 --> 01:18:03,579
So there's a place we have to jump from here.

1741
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:07,279
Like over there.

1742
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:13,539
I remember I remember you spawning in different location

1743
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:14,340
over here.

1744
01:18:17,579 --> 01:18:18,579
I think it's over here.

1745
01:18:19,619 --> 01:18:19,920
Is it this?

1746
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:20,819
Yeah, I think it's this way.

1747
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:27,909
We make this I feel like I would with the horse.

1748
01:18:28,510 --> 01:18:29,710
It's a bit further ahead.

1749
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:35,140
Oh, no, we're gonna no, no, no, no, we're about to just jump

1750
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:35,939
off and die.

1751
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:37,539
I believe I know what they're talking about.

1752
01:18:37,539 --> 01:18:39,439
But I just remembered you spawning in this area in a

1753
01:18:39,439 --> 01:18:43,829
different spot in mod chat.

1754
01:18:46,399 --> 01:18:48,699
Wait, the mod mods playing game form again.

1755
01:18:49,699 --> 01:18:55,210
I mean they had the helping it is over there.

1756
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:00,680
Yeah, it is that spot and we have to do it from.

1757
01:19:02,479 --> 01:19:03,079
Oh man.

1758
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:04,079
Okay, hold on.

1759
01:19:04,579 --> 01:19:10,680
We got to do it from like back over here.

1760
01:19:12,449 --> 01:19:13,449
Where's that from?

1761
01:19:13,449 --> 01:19:14,250
Like right here.

1762
01:19:19,989 --> 01:19:20,789
This shit out of the way.

1763
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:22,680
Wait, what is it?

1764
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:23,579
It's right here, right?

1765
01:19:23,979 --> 01:19:24,579
Right there.

1766
01:19:27,029 --> 01:19:27,930
It is patched.

1767
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:29,229
Several people are saying it's patched.

1768
01:19:29,229 --> 01:19:30,029
Wait, that's not it.

1769
01:19:30,430 --> 01:19:30,829
Is that it?

1770
01:19:30,829 --> 01:19:31,329
Yes, it is.

1771
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:33,770
So it's like right here.

1772
01:19:38,199 --> 01:19:41,069
Fuck my souls.

1773
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:47,350
That was close.

1774
01:19:53,310 --> 01:19:54,210
Oh, you respawn here.

1775
01:19:54,409 --> 01:19:55,109
Spawn right here.

1776
01:19:55,109 --> 01:19:56,810
I think what about like from here?

1777
01:19:59,810 --> 01:20:02,630
Got it patched.

1778
01:20:03,229 --> 01:20:03,729
Okay, we're good.

1779
01:20:04,130 --> 01:20:06,630
It's that there's a little lip that you have to land on.

1780
01:20:07,029 --> 01:20:08,430
Yeah, it's tricky.

1781
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:12,430
There's like a little extra a little bit to the right.

1782
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:26,770
You're a little extra on the top one or the bottom one.

1783
01:20:27,369 --> 01:20:28,970
So do you okay where you are right now?

1784
01:20:29,470 --> 01:20:32,270
You see what that little that rock Juts out just a little like

1785
01:20:32,270 --> 01:20:33,270
a hair extra.

1786
01:20:33,270 --> 01:20:34,170
That's where you want to jump from.

1787
01:20:40,479 --> 01:20:41,180
You're better than me.

1788
01:20:41,279 --> 01:20:43,479
It was not it was I got it in the right spot.

1789
01:20:43,479 --> 01:20:44,579
It's actually really tricky.

1790
01:20:44,979 --> 01:20:46,180
You have to do that thing.

1791
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:49,579
Like, okay, imagine you're playing Legend of Zelda, you know,

1792
01:20:49,579 --> 01:20:52,479
in Legend of Zelda it jumped for you at the last possible

1793
01:20:52,479 --> 01:20:53,979
frame never played any of them.

1794
01:20:55,229 --> 01:21:07,760
Hold on closer closer.

1795
01:21:08,159 --> 01:21:09,960
Yeah, it's that I've got this next one.

1796
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:12,760
It's almost you have to step off of the platform.

1797
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:16,560
Yeah a little and get that last hair that last you got a

1798
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:18,060
wind walk on the Wind Waker.

1799
01:21:18,859 --> 01:21:21,359
There's an earth tree avatar over here and it's messing.

1800
01:21:21,359 --> 01:21:21,859
Okay.

1801
01:21:21,859 --> 01:21:22,760
I be careful.

1802
01:21:24,449 --> 01:21:27,439
I don't want to have to do this again, dude.

1803
01:21:27,439 --> 01:21:28,640
This is actually really bad.

1804
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:35,890
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1805
01:21:36,189 --> 01:21:37,390
Is there a bonfire right here?

1806
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,600
Because if I just get the bonfire, can't you just port

1807
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:42,000
to it?

1808
01:21:42,779 --> 01:21:54,890
No, no, you can't I hit it.

1809
01:21:54,890 --> 01:21:58,090
That was very very close, but you got to land on this

1810
01:21:58,090 --> 01:21:59,189
like edge.

1811
01:22:00,189 --> 01:22:02,090
I have to I have to land on the other side.

1812
01:22:04,659 --> 01:22:06,960
Oh, I didn't I thought I was going to the lava.

1813
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,399
No, no, you took what?

1814
01:22:09,399 --> 01:22:10,699
What do you see where I'm standing?

1815
01:22:11,729 --> 01:22:12,029
Okay.

1816
01:22:12,029 --> 01:22:14,430
No, now that I know that wait, you thought you were jumping

1817
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:15,430
into the lava.

1818
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:21,359
What if I take off your equipment?

1819
01:22:21,359 --> 01:22:26,260
Maybe this this is a I got to tell you this is not even

1820
01:22:26,260 --> 01:22:26,859
the hard part.

1821
01:22:28,079 --> 01:22:28,579
Really?

1822
01:22:28,579 --> 01:22:32,680
No, because we have to get by a like one foot hallway

1823
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:34,680
where an archery avatar is just sitting there and it's

1824
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:35,579
like we're going to fall off.

1825
01:22:46,810 --> 01:22:48,010
Maybe they patched it on your game.

1826
01:22:48,970 --> 01:22:50,069
Yeah, because I'm the host.

1827
01:22:59,000 --> 01:22:59,399
Oh, wait.

1828
01:22:59,399 --> 01:23:00,199
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1829
01:23:00,199 --> 01:23:03,199
So like not the lava like where do I land?

1830
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:06,260
You want to land on the rock where I am?

1831
01:23:06,659 --> 01:23:07,159
Okay.

1832
01:23:19,329 --> 01:23:21,229
Oh, that was it right there.

1833
01:23:21,229 --> 01:23:23,029
I was on it for a second.

1834
01:23:27,479 --> 01:23:28,880
Use his controller.

1835
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:31,260
I we can't do that bro.

1836
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:32,359
Can you take the controller?

1837
01:23:33,829 --> 01:23:34,630
I can't do that bro.

1838
01:23:34,630 --> 01:23:35,329
Take it bro.

1839
01:23:35,329 --> 01:23:37,029
All right, just easy.

1840
01:23:37,029 --> 01:23:37,829
Okay, I got it.

1841
01:23:39,689 --> 01:23:43,090
It let me hold on as yet and you're like not even you got

1842
01:23:43,090 --> 01:23:44,289
wasn't connected when you did it earlier.

1843
01:23:44,289 --> 01:23:45,289
I wasn't connected though.

1844
01:23:45,289 --> 01:23:46,590
You didn't even jump at all.

1845
01:23:47,090 --> 01:23:47,890
I wasn't even connected.

1846
01:23:47,890 --> 01:23:48,390
Hold on.

1847
01:23:48,789 --> 01:23:49,489
Can you plug me in?

1848
01:23:50,090 --> 01:23:51,590
Yeah, that's Wi-Fi.

1849
01:23:51,689 --> 01:23:53,090
Okay, that's the wireless.

1850
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:04,979
Something there's something wrong something wrong with

1851
01:24:04,979 --> 01:24:05,380
your controller.

1852
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:06,279
Okay, give it back.

1853
01:24:06,279 --> 01:24:06,880
Give it back here.

1854
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:07,579
Just take it back.

1855
01:24:08,079 --> 01:24:08,880
I have a fucking headache now.

1856
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:09,380
Thanks.

1857
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:12,479
You control your your your B buttons like sticky.

1858
01:24:12,479 --> 01:24:13,779
I don't know what the fuck you're eating.

1859
01:24:13,779 --> 01:24:14,680
It's different.

1860
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:18,149
It's different in Neo fucking headache.

1861
01:24:18,149 --> 01:24:26,670
No, I fucking hate it.

1862
01:24:30,170 --> 01:24:32,270
We're going to be here all day VOD viewers.

1863
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:34,340
You can't skip.

1864
01:24:37,609 --> 01:24:41,310
Yeah, dude, you should disable disable timeline skipping

1865
01:24:41,310 --> 01:24:41,909
on this VOD.

1866
01:24:42,409 --> 01:24:50,050
Oh, you have to do it at a 30 FPS because if you jump in

1867
01:24:50,050 --> 01:24:54,960
Dark Souls at a high frame rate, it doesn't work magic.

1868
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:55,659
You could do that.

1869
01:24:56,529 --> 01:24:57,729
That's that's a real Dark Souls.

1870
01:24:57,729 --> 01:24:58,229
No, no, no.

1871
01:24:58,229 --> 01:25:01,329
I mean like make it so people cannot like skip through

1872
01:25:01,329 --> 01:25:02,430
your VODs timeline.

1873
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:04,979
Now you have to watch.

1874
01:25:05,579 --> 01:25:06,180
Sorry.

1875
01:25:07,479 --> 01:25:09,579
You have to sit here for this like 20 minutes.

1876
01:25:10,260 --> 01:25:10,760
I got it.

1877
01:25:11,869 --> 01:25:12,569
Are you serious?

1878
01:25:12,569 --> 01:25:13,270
That's very close.

1879
01:25:14,069 --> 01:25:17,930
Do you see where you okay to on your left?

1880
01:25:17,930 --> 01:25:20,130
It is a piece that juts out a little bit further.

1881
01:25:20,229 --> 01:25:22,229
You want to land on that like little piece that's jutted

1882
01:25:22,229 --> 01:25:23,029
out a little further.

1883
01:25:23,029 --> 01:25:24,930
It's like very very nuanced.

1884
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:27,640
Yeah, you got to go a little more to the left.

1885
01:25:28,430 --> 01:25:31,630
This one's for all the fucking Wolf Boys in chat.

1886
01:25:32,390 --> 01:25:32,890
Okay.

1887
01:25:32,890 --> 01:25:33,390
All right.

1888
01:25:35,569 --> 01:25:38,920
Don't seem to care about them really at all after that.

1889
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:50,510
This one goes out to all my scaly brethren.

1890
01:25:50,710 --> 01:25:51,310
Okay.

1891
01:25:57,239 --> 01:26:00,229
I missed I'm getting worse.

1892
01:26:02,149 --> 01:26:02,350
All right.

1893
01:26:02,350 --> 01:26:04,250
I'm going to stand where you should be.

1894
01:26:04,350 --> 01:26:05,949
I have so many debuffs.

1895
01:26:05,949 --> 01:26:08,350
I'm concerned that even if I make it I will die because

1896
01:26:08,350 --> 01:26:09,850
I have like no health.

1897
01:26:10,850 --> 01:26:11,949
Whoa, okay.

1898
01:26:11,949 --> 01:26:12,250
Never.

1899
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:12,649
I don't care.

1900
01:26:12,649 --> 01:26:13,149
Just do it.

1901
01:26:13,449 --> 01:26:14,149
I was going to stand.

1902
01:26:14,149 --> 01:26:16,619
Okay, you need to land like here.

1903
01:26:17,710 --> 01:26:18,609
Okay, I'm aiming.

1904
01:26:18,609 --> 01:26:19,909
Okay, no stay there.

1905
01:26:19,909 --> 01:26:22,310
No, because you're not going to be able to land on it.

1906
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:26,279
I think that's it.

1907
01:26:33,250 --> 01:26:36,350
Wow, you guys really stand on it.

1908
01:26:36,350 --> 01:26:37,250
This is kind of embarrassing.

1909
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:38,649
He really must hate those skillies.

1910
01:26:38,649 --> 01:26:41,250
Oh, I don't yeah, I don't he's fucking take a while.

1911
01:26:41,850 --> 01:26:42,449
That's all right.

1912
01:26:42,449 --> 01:26:43,550
I'll be here when you guys are ready.

1913
01:26:50,090 --> 01:26:52,760
Hey, big fan of you two.

1914
01:26:53,260 --> 01:26:53,960
Can I get in here?

1915
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:55,659
I'll switch friend code by any chance.

1916
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:57,260
Is this your lizard voice?

1917
01:26:57,260 --> 01:26:58,560
Are you mocking lizards?

1918
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,659
No, it's all good man.

1919
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:01,159
Well, no, it's good.

1920
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:02,439
Keep trying.

1921
01:27:04,819 --> 01:27:07,119
No, me and the urge ray avatar are hanging out and having

1922
01:27:07,119 --> 01:27:07,920
a conversation.

1923
01:27:08,420 --> 01:27:15,729
Hey see your way out of it next one.

1924
01:27:15,729 --> 01:27:17,130
I have it next one.

1925
01:27:18,539 --> 01:27:19,939
I have it 100%.

1926
01:27:20,039 --> 01:27:22,840
I feel like I just connected the dots.

1927
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:27,010
You're going to come down there and help could you maybe

1928
01:27:27,010 --> 01:27:28,310
you could I'm just kidding.

1929
01:27:28,310 --> 01:27:29,010
I'm gonna kill you.

1930
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:32,779
God damn it guys.

1931
01:27:32,779 --> 01:27:33,380
He's so bored.

1932
01:27:33,380 --> 01:27:34,279
He's doing fits.

1933
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:35,880
I'm fucking up everything.

1934
01:27:37,239 --> 01:27:39,239
I was pretty like aggro him down here.

1935
01:27:41,279 --> 01:27:42,279
Oh, you made it.

1936
01:27:42,979 --> 01:27:43,180
All right.

1937
01:27:43,180 --> 01:27:44,380
Good luck because now this is the hard part.

1938
01:27:46,119 --> 01:27:47,819
I actually have so many debuffs.

1939
01:27:47,819 --> 01:27:48,520
I have no health.

1940
01:27:49,479 --> 01:27:51,680
You are guaranteed to die.

1941
01:27:51,979 --> 01:27:53,180
I'm just telling you right now.

1942
01:27:53,380 --> 01:27:54,279
Don't be upset.

1943
01:27:54,479 --> 01:27:56,479
Hope you got that down because there's no way you're getting

1944
01:27:56,479 --> 01:27:56,979
by this.

1945
01:27:59,739 --> 01:28:00,640
What did you just do?

1946
01:28:01,039 --> 01:28:01,840
I use the rune arc.

1947
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:02,439
It didn't do anything.

1948
01:28:02,439 --> 01:28:02,840
All right.

1949
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:03,439
We have to go.

1950
01:28:04,510 --> 01:28:05,710
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

1951
01:28:05,710 --> 01:28:06,710
back up, back up, back up, back up.

1952
01:28:06,710 --> 01:28:07,710
Where are we going?

1953
01:28:07,909 --> 01:28:09,109
Where's the correct path from here?

1954
01:28:09,609 --> 01:28:11,310
We can get on the rooftop to the left.

1955
01:28:11,310 --> 01:28:13,810
I don't like where are we go to the left or up?

1956
01:28:17,710 --> 01:28:22,170
Where's the way to get a bonfire quick left?

1957
01:28:26,550 --> 01:28:28,350
It's one for all the Wolfman out there.

1958
01:28:34,050 --> 01:28:34,449
That's okay.

1959
01:28:34,449 --> 01:28:35,649
You got this jump first try.

1960
01:28:43,619 --> 01:28:45,920
They were just like bugs in my clothing.

1961
01:28:48,159 --> 01:28:49,460
There was so many bugs.

1962
01:28:52,630 --> 01:28:54,130
Fucking God damn it.

1963
01:28:54,229 --> 01:28:56,229
Now we're going to sit here for like another 10 minutes while

1964
01:28:56,229 --> 01:28:57,130
I do this.

1965
01:28:57,529 --> 01:28:59,029
I did it first try.

1966
01:29:01,590 --> 01:29:09,699
Dude, my stamina bar is like the size of my right here.

1967
01:29:10,300 --> 01:29:11,300
It's like right there.

1968
01:29:14,529 --> 01:29:16,430
I have to get it in less and I have to get in less than five

1969
01:29:16,430 --> 01:29:18,930
tries so I can prove that I am better than you at this.

1970
01:29:19,529 --> 01:29:24,000
Okay, there was no doubt about it.

1971
01:29:24,979 --> 01:29:26,779
But I think also you left your souls.

1972
01:29:30,039 --> 01:29:30,939
I'm so angry at you.

1973
01:29:30,939 --> 01:29:31,640
This is your fault.

1974
01:29:34,529 --> 01:29:35,829
This is your fault that that happened.

1975
01:29:35,930 --> 01:29:36,529
I didn't in three tries.

1976
01:29:36,529 --> 01:29:37,029
I'm better than you.

1977
01:29:37,630 --> 01:29:38,229
Let's go left.

1978
01:29:38,329 --> 01:29:38,729
Okay.

1979
01:29:38,930 --> 01:29:42,029
Well, I'm going to jump off again to prove that I can do it

1980
01:29:42,029 --> 01:29:42,529
in three.

1981
01:29:47,069 --> 01:29:48,170
Wait, no, you don't do that.

1982
01:29:48,850 --> 01:29:49,250
All right.

1983
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:50,649
I have no idea what we're doing here.

1984
01:29:50,649 --> 01:29:57,210
We need to be careful because the firing lasers over here.

1985
01:29:59,300 --> 01:29:59,699
What's that?

1986
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:03,000
This way we jump from here.

1987
01:30:06,659 --> 01:30:06,960
Okay.

1988
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:08,359
I guess we're all right.

1989
01:30:15,159 --> 01:30:15,760
Don't die.

1990
01:30:22,069 --> 01:30:24,770
We're in we just have to find the right bonfire.

1991
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:36,119
Why am I mad that I killed the pot?

1992
01:30:36,220 --> 01:30:37,520
Oh, it's all right.

1993
01:30:43,539 --> 01:30:44,439
Oh, there's a dog.

1994
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:45,439
There's a dog.

1995
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:47,739
You don't want to get the item over here.

1996
01:30:48,539 --> 01:30:50,039
I jumped across a weird way.

1997
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:51,739
There's dogs growling on me.

1998
01:30:51,739 --> 01:30:53,439
Oh God, he gonna get me.

1999
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:54,239
No, no, no.

2000
01:30:54,239 --> 01:30:57,420
I'm good.

2001
01:30:58,399 --> 01:30:59,399
I can't lock onto him.

2002
01:30:59,899 --> 01:31:00,500
Just I'm right here.

2003
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:00,899
I'm right here.

2004
01:31:01,199 --> 01:31:02,000
Just focus.

2005
01:31:03,939 --> 01:31:04,340
Got him.

2006
01:31:09,050 --> 01:31:10,850
I do no damage because all my curses.

2007
01:31:14,380 --> 01:31:17,229
Okay, we don't go up.

2008
01:31:19,119 --> 01:31:20,119
I thought you did that.

2009
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:22,640
Oh, no.

2010
01:31:23,439 --> 01:31:24,340
Oh, no.

2011
01:31:24,439 --> 01:31:25,239
What are you doing?

2012
01:31:26,239 --> 01:31:27,239
What are you doing?

2013
01:31:28,439 --> 01:31:30,640
Shoot a fucking beam at him or something, dude.

2014
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:31,340
What the hell?

2015
01:31:31,939 --> 01:31:33,039
I don't do any damage.

2016
01:31:33,039 --> 01:31:33,939
I'm out of magic.

2017
01:31:33,939 --> 01:31:36,039
My magic bar is like a centimeter.

2018
01:31:36,039 --> 01:31:36,439
All right.

2019
01:31:36,539 --> 01:31:38,239
We how we can't get up there.

2020
01:31:41,420 --> 01:31:46,680
No, not one more fucking Craig.

2021
01:31:47,550 --> 01:31:47,949
All right.

2022
01:31:56,750 --> 01:31:57,550
There's an elevator.

2023
01:31:57,550 --> 01:32:00,449
We tell you we want to take an elevator up currently.

2024
01:32:07,710 --> 01:32:09,409
I know there's an item over there, but I'm telling you it's not

2025
01:32:09,409 --> 01:32:09,810
worth it.

2026
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:12,960
We need an elevator.

2027
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:15,060
Elevator is across the lava.

2028
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:22,170
I think over here this way.

2029
01:32:23,970 --> 01:32:24,569
We have to go.

2030
01:32:24,569 --> 01:32:25,270
Where do we go?

2031
01:32:28,449 --> 01:32:29,350
Oh shit.

2032
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:31,319
Go on the rooftops.

2033
01:32:33,189 --> 01:32:33,689
I'm dead.

2034
01:32:33,989 --> 01:32:34,590
Oh, no.

2035
01:32:36,199 --> 01:32:37,000
Oh, no.

2036
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:48,970
Go left then elevator up the lava just slows you mostly.

2037
01:32:48,970 --> 01:32:51,670
If you have to quickstep you can make it walk on the lava, please.

2038
01:32:51,970 --> 01:33:02,020
I can't I don't I don't have enough health if we have to walk

2039
01:33:02,020 --> 01:33:02,819
across the lava.

2040
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:08,220
You actually don't I seriously have like a centimeter of a health

2041
01:33:08,220 --> 01:33:08,520
bar.

2042
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:09,420
So all right.

2043
01:33:09,819 --> 01:33:14,119
So you talk about like down here walk like in that way a walk

2044
01:33:14,119 --> 01:33:17,619
like down this way down like there.

2045
01:33:17,819 --> 01:33:31,640
You mean right left need to hide here because I cast this bullshit.

2046
01:33:39,619 --> 01:33:41,420
You're going to have no health bar.

2047
01:33:43,350 --> 01:33:44,449
I think we should leave.

2048
01:33:45,350 --> 01:33:47,350
Yeah, but we like we're so close.

2049
01:33:47,350 --> 01:33:49,850
So what about like you come up this way like over there?

2050
01:33:50,449 --> 01:33:54,520
Well, can you just do it and then get a vote to teleport like

2051
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:54,920
this?

2052
01:33:57,720 --> 01:34:00,420
Yeah, I think you jump in between that area and then you turn

2053
01:34:00,420 --> 01:34:09,880
you go right not well, we're going for it now not like this.

2054
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:11,479
Yeah, flash.

2055
01:34:11,479 --> 01:34:12,779
I think you can still make it.

2056
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:20,640
I think you missed it.

2057
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:24,939
Where where where you got to go back around around this octagon

2058
01:34:26,039 --> 01:34:30,039
into the hole into the gap to the right in here to the right

2059
01:34:30,439 --> 01:34:47,079
right now where oh now what all right.

2060
01:34:47,079 --> 01:34:48,180
Oh my god, just don't die.

2061
01:34:48,779 --> 01:34:49,880
Where's the bonfire from here?

2062
01:34:49,979 --> 01:34:52,279
I forget it's like I told you the wrong way.

2063
01:34:52,579 --> 01:34:52,979
It's okay.

2064
01:34:53,579 --> 01:34:54,479
That's like a joke.

2065
01:35:00,699 --> 01:35:02,699
Oh, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup.

2066
01:35:02,699 --> 01:35:03,800
Then there's the thing you go up.

2067
01:35:05,739 --> 01:35:06,939
She says you died.

2068
01:35:07,439 --> 01:35:07,640
All right.

2069
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:09,140
Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup,

2070
01:35:09,140 --> 01:35:10,439
yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup.

2071
01:35:11,569 --> 01:35:13,069
Is anyone's cat like looking?

2072
01:35:13,569 --> 01:35:14,270
Yup, yup, yup, yup.

2073
01:35:14,270 --> 01:35:14,970
Is that like a cat?

2074
01:35:14,970 --> 01:35:15,470
I don't know.

2075
01:35:15,569 --> 01:35:16,670
You just make weird noises.

2076
01:35:17,369 --> 01:35:20,170
That's not a typical like come here cat noise.

2077
01:35:20,970 --> 01:35:25,770
So I noticed that my wife Ashley she always talks to her dog

2078
01:35:26,270 --> 01:35:28,470
exactly the same way as the rest of her family.

2079
01:35:28,470 --> 01:35:30,569
They like, you know, there's like a dog speak where you like

2080
01:35:30,569 --> 01:35:31,470
change your tone of voice.

2081
01:35:32,170 --> 01:35:33,170
You know, yes.

2082
01:35:33,569 --> 01:35:36,270
So I was like you like exactly like your sister exactly like

2083
01:35:36,270 --> 01:35:37,670
you all talk to your dog the same way.

2084
01:35:37,670 --> 01:35:38,869
I was like, that's kind of weird.

2085
01:35:38,869 --> 01:35:39,970
And she was like, oh, that's not weird.

2086
01:35:39,970 --> 01:35:41,069
That's just like we're a family.

2087
01:35:41,739 --> 01:35:43,439
So I was like, oh, well, you there's like plenty of ways

2088
01:35:43,439 --> 01:35:44,739
you could talk to your dog.

2089
01:35:44,739 --> 01:35:46,140
And let me give you an example.

2090
01:35:46,539 --> 01:35:49,539
Our dog's name is mouse and I just got really weird and slowly

2091
01:35:49,539 --> 01:35:54,770
started hovering down to it going a mouse cute dog.

2092
01:35:54,770 --> 01:35:58,770
And she got so fucking scared and like was panicking to get

2093
01:35:58,770 --> 01:35:59,369
away from me.

2094
01:36:00,529 --> 01:36:01,329
What the fuck?

2095
01:36:03,399 --> 01:36:05,100
Yeah, I don't.

2096
01:36:08,779 --> 01:36:11,880
Apparently you need the fucking like psycho.

2097
01:36:13,479 --> 01:36:16,680
You need to like do we like anime or whatever voice?

2098
01:36:20,420 --> 01:36:22,319
Yeah, how's that anime voice?

2099
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:26,399
It's I don't know.

2100
01:36:26,899 --> 01:36:29,899
Everything is like a little like a few pitches higher.

2101
01:36:30,399 --> 01:36:33,100
I would say that's more Muppets than anime.

2102
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:35,300
That's more like Sesame Street than anime.

2103
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:37,979
Do you like sesame seeds?

2104
01:36:38,779 --> 01:36:39,079
Yeah.

2105
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:40,180
All right.

2106
01:36:40,180 --> 01:36:42,279
They don't have any flavor and they get stuck in your teeth.

2107
01:36:43,180 --> 01:36:43,880
The bridge is up.

2108
01:36:44,180 --> 01:36:45,680
So that is complete.

2109
01:36:45,779 --> 01:36:48,079
Now we just go this way and I think we can open up this back

2110
01:36:48,579 --> 01:36:49,380
door here, right?

2111
01:37:00,050 --> 01:37:01,250
And then this is here.

2112
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:03,899
It doesn't open from this side.

2113
01:37:05,159 --> 01:37:07,100
It's okay.

2114
01:37:11,170 --> 01:37:12,470
This whole thing was for nothing.

2115
01:37:15,489 --> 01:37:17,390
We have to beat this boss in here.

2116
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:24,560
Find a different bonfire.

2117
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:25,159
Okay.

2118
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:29,960
All right, please pray to the randomizer gods.

2119
01:37:30,359 --> 01:37:36,060
That you just keep dying that in here is like mad soldier 2.

2120
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:37,439
I'm almost there.

2121
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:40,699
Can I like peek in here and see who it is?

2122
01:37:41,199 --> 01:37:42,199
Oh, is that the boss?

2123
01:37:42,199 --> 01:37:44,100
Oh, yeah, and they would glitch that door.

2124
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:45,100
See the bro.

2125
01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:46,100
It's bad soldier.

2126
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:47,300
I think it's mad soldier 2.

2127
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:49,579
This is huge.

2128
01:37:49,579 --> 01:37:50,979
I think that's just a shitty enemy.

2129
01:37:50,979 --> 01:37:51,479
Isn't it?

2130
01:37:54,579 --> 01:37:55,779
I think that's a mad soldier 2.

2131
01:37:55,779 --> 01:37:58,270
I think wait a minute.

2132
01:37:58,270 --> 01:37:58,869
No, it's not.

2133
01:38:02,229 --> 01:38:02,829
Who is that?

2134
01:38:03,029 --> 01:38:03,829
Do I have binoculars?

2135
01:38:06,619 --> 01:38:07,819
No, I don't want to die.

2136
01:38:08,649 --> 01:38:09,850
Got to do it eventually.

2137
01:38:12,119 --> 01:38:13,319
Everybody dies once.

2138
01:38:14,119 --> 01:38:21,619
Is it blade from Mortal Kombat?

2139
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:24,140
All right.

2140
01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:29,199
So but I think there's a just go go go.

2141
01:38:29,199 --> 01:38:30,000
Is it Gideon?

2142
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,960
I'm just going who is it?

2143
01:38:36,289 --> 01:38:36,890
It's blade.

2144
01:38:36,890 --> 01:38:41,260
I think it's millennia.

2145
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:45,859
It runs over did the runs over the runs over the runs over.

2146
01:38:45,859 --> 01:38:47,260
What the fuck we're not going to do.

2147
01:38:47,260 --> 01:38:47,760
I'm not going to wait.

2148
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:48,760
There's no it's impossible.

2149
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:55,859
It's you got to be not going to have a face to you got it.

2150
01:38:55,859 --> 01:38:56,159
Wait.

2151
01:38:56,460 --> 01:38:57,060
Yes, she is.

2152
01:38:58,579 --> 01:38:58,779
Wait.

2153
01:38:58,779 --> 01:39:04,390
Yeah, she is that half health as long as you're good at the game.

2154
01:39:04,390 --> 01:39:04,989
You can win.

2155
01:39:05,390 --> 01:39:11,289
I haven't played against millennia in a long ass time and I have a lot

2156
01:39:27,590 --> 01:39:38,550
flawless just watch out for when she swings the sword.

2157
01:39:43,420 --> 01:39:46,920
A lot of people thought millennia don't know the sword hurts swords

2158
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:47,520
where the damage comes.

2159
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:48,920
I have like no stamina.

2160
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:21,899
It was the sword.

2161
01:40:22,739 --> 01:40:26,439
It's the fact that it's the fact that I have fucking like half of my

2162
01:40:26,439 --> 01:40:32,939
HP and half of my stamina bar and it's millennia and I hate this motherfucker.

2163
01:40:36,579 --> 01:40:36,680
Yeah.

2164
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:42,380
Well, I can't take one take of lava damage and I'm back here.

2165
01:40:44,199 --> 01:40:45,000
I'm in hell.

2166
01:40:47,199 --> 01:40:47,399
Okay.

2167
01:40:47,399 --> 01:40:48,000
So here's the plan.

2168
01:40:50,439 --> 01:40:51,439
I can't believe millennia.

2169
01:40:51,439 --> 01:40:53,239
I really hope there's no face to all right.

2170
01:40:53,239 --> 01:40:54,039
So here's what we're going to do.

2171
01:40:54,739 --> 01:40:56,039
Follow me ready.

2172
01:40:57,420 --> 01:40:58,619
I can't take any.

2173
01:40:58,819 --> 01:41:00,520
All right, but me raising the bridge.

2174
01:41:00,619 --> 01:41:01,319
Jerma Jerma.

2175
01:41:01,319 --> 01:41:01,819
Look at this.

2176
01:41:06,739 --> 01:41:07,939
Okay, we have to leave.

2177
01:41:08,239 --> 01:41:09,340
We have to leave.

2178
01:41:09,439 --> 01:41:10,539
We can't stay here.

2179
01:41:10,739 --> 01:41:12,739
We have to we have to leave.

2180
01:41:16,079 --> 01:41:17,579
Does anybody have a solution?

2181
01:41:20,399 --> 01:41:23,000
You can get to it from the rooftops.

2182
01:41:24,739 --> 01:41:25,239
Okay.

2183
01:41:25,739 --> 01:41:35,260
Let's see if I can fuck did why why are we here?

2184
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:36,960
Just to suffer.

2185
01:41:37,359 --> 01:41:40,060
I think I should we just go to the Altus Plateau.

2186
01:41:41,539 --> 01:41:44,779
There's so many different things we could do go through the caves.

2187
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:47,899
There's a bonfire over there you bozo.

2188
01:41:48,699 --> 01:41:51,899
I mean, it's I don't remember where all this stuff is.

2189
01:41:52,739 --> 01:41:54,539
Is a grace in the town.

2190
01:41:55,039 --> 01:41:56,439
I'm going to I'm going to save us.

2191
01:41:56,439 --> 01:41:57,640
Okay, I promise.

2192
01:41:57,640 --> 01:41:58,439
I'm going to rescue us.

2193
01:42:00,470 --> 01:42:02,970
You know what you should just sit down at a bonfire.

2194
01:42:03,569 --> 01:42:04,369
I just didn't okay.

2195
01:42:04,369 --> 01:42:05,069
I'm going to save us.

2196
01:42:05,170 --> 01:42:05,770
I'm going to save us.

2197
01:42:05,869 --> 01:42:06,970
It's going to be all up to me.

2198
01:42:23,579 --> 01:42:24,979
Your health bar is going to look like mine.

2199
01:42:25,479 --> 01:42:26,680
It's not great already.

2200
01:42:43,550 --> 01:42:43,850
All right.

2201
01:42:44,050 --> 01:42:47,449
Nice and watch this the ledge master.

2202
01:42:55,210 --> 01:42:56,609
There's a gargoyle following you.

2203
01:42:57,010 --> 01:42:59,609
But oh fuck you guy.

2204
01:43:00,210 --> 01:43:03,409
He he that was very impressive.

2205
01:43:04,310 --> 01:43:08,079
I don't know why he's still here.

2206
01:43:13,310 --> 01:43:13,710
Okay.

2207
01:43:13,810 --> 01:43:14,010
All right.

2208
01:43:14,010 --> 01:43:14,310
All right.

2209
01:43:14,310 --> 01:43:15,609
I'm going to find us a bonfire.

2210
01:43:17,220 --> 01:43:20,319
Ah, stop calm down.

2211
01:43:28,899 --> 01:43:31,100
Okay in on this.

2212
01:43:31,100 --> 01:43:35,380
I think this one in this town somewhere hanging out like in here.

2213
01:43:39,069 --> 01:43:40,470
You're right up the ladder.

2214
01:43:42,140 --> 01:43:42,739
Hold on.

2215
01:43:42,939 --> 01:43:44,140
Let me just be smart about this.

2216
01:43:44,140 --> 01:43:44,840
Are you watching?

2217
01:43:45,539 --> 01:43:46,840
I'm the best I can.

2218
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:53,060
I'm so nervous.

2219
01:43:54,060 --> 01:44:04,770
I don't know what that was, but it was big whatever it was.

2220
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:12,289
It was a huge where it looks like the Great Wolf from the classroom.

2221
01:44:12,989 --> 01:44:13,489
Okay.

2222
01:44:13,489 --> 01:44:15,989
Well, this ladder is the ladder somewhere right here somewhere.

2223
01:44:15,989 --> 01:44:16,489
Where's the ladder?

2224
01:44:16,489 --> 01:44:17,090
I don't see it.

2225
01:44:17,090 --> 01:44:17,989
I'm looking for a ladder.

2226
01:44:20,119 --> 01:44:20,720
Fuck.

2227
01:44:21,319 --> 01:44:22,119
Where's this ladder?

2228
01:44:22,819 --> 01:44:23,220
Help me.

2229
01:44:23,220 --> 01:44:30,050
Somebody help where it was right there.

2230
01:44:30,149 --> 01:44:31,250
I don't know.

2231
01:44:31,250 --> 01:44:32,149
I don't know where it is.

2232
01:44:33,210 --> 01:44:33,510
Dude.

2233
01:44:33,510 --> 01:44:37,020
I where is this a ladder?

2234
01:44:37,020 --> 01:44:38,920
Where is this fucking ladder?

2235
01:44:43,189 --> 01:44:44,890
It's next to the gunpowder enemy.

2236
01:44:44,890 --> 01:44:45,590
You're just panicking.

2237
01:44:45,590 --> 01:44:47,090
That's a giant dog.

2238
01:44:49,680 --> 01:44:50,180
I got us.

2239
01:44:50,180 --> 01:44:50,680
I got us somewhere.

2240
01:44:50,680 --> 01:44:51,380
I'm going to rescue us.

2241
01:44:51,380 --> 01:44:51,979
Just relax.

2242
01:44:57,340 --> 01:44:57,739
All right.

2243
01:44:58,510 --> 01:45:00,109
Where is this fucking ladder?

2244
01:45:00,310 --> 01:45:01,710
I'm so mad at this game.

2245
01:45:02,609 --> 01:45:03,510
I'm so mad at this game.

2246
01:45:04,010 --> 01:45:04,710
I hate this game.

2247
01:45:11,319 --> 01:45:13,119
Don't you fucking kidding me?

2248
01:45:18,989 --> 01:45:20,689
Yeah, Neo 2 has to as a co-op.

2249
01:45:25,810 --> 01:45:27,810
Why is that dog down there?

2250
01:45:28,510 --> 01:45:29,710
It's not fair.

2251
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:35,739
What would the developers thinking putting that there?

2252
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:41,180
What a dog in the lava?

2253
01:45:49,279 --> 01:45:50,779
Dude, I actually don't have health.

2254
01:45:52,079 --> 01:45:52,880
If I all right.

2255
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:56,779
It's one tick and get I'm getting some conflicted info that even

2256
01:45:56,779 --> 01:46:00,180
if I use the ladder the doors locked that I'm going to get to that

2257
01:46:00,180 --> 01:46:00,680
correct.

2258
01:46:00,779 --> 01:46:03,680
Am I being trolled right now by 600 million people?

2259
01:46:08,300 --> 01:46:10,699
I pressed it but that is correct.

2260
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:11,100
Okay.

2261
01:46:11,699 --> 01:46:15,789
I don't think we can physically do this area unless we kill

2262
01:46:15,789 --> 01:46:16,289
millennia.

2263
01:46:17,579 --> 01:46:23,800
I believe that's true because I know even speedruns would kill

2264
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:26,699
that boss and they want to not fight that boss.

2265
01:46:28,380 --> 01:46:32,369
So if there were a way around it, they'd probably do it.

2266
01:46:33,529 --> 01:46:37,029
Okay, this time I'm going to wait for you to do nowadays.

2267
01:46:37,430 --> 01:46:41,130
We just like like can we even warp out and just get some hit

2268
01:46:41,130 --> 01:46:41,630
points?

2269
01:46:42,609 --> 01:46:43,909
I'm going to try this one more shot here.

2270
01:46:44,609 --> 01:46:47,210
I was so excited to play Elden Ring today.

2271
01:46:48,510 --> 01:46:49,109
We're okay.

2272
01:46:50,539 --> 01:46:52,640
I'm taking so much more damage for tick.

2273
01:47:04,140 --> 01:47:04,640
Okay.

2274
01:47:05,569 --> 01:47:09,170
So before I run in here, there's a ladder on the right.

2275
01:47:09,369 --> 01:47:11,369
You don't even fuck you.

2276
01:47:11,569 --> 01:47:13,569
You came over here because you knew I was going to be here.

2277
01:47:13,569 --> 01:47:14,970
Now you sit there looking at me.

2278
01:47:15,170 --> 01:47:15,869
That's bullshit.

2279
01:47:15,869 --> 01:47:16,569
Do you know it?

2280
01:47:21,630 --> 01:47:22,930
It's up the road.

2281
01:47:28,119 --> 01:47:30,779
I am up the road.

2282
01:47:30,779 --> 01:47:34,420
You see look at the clip that doesn't do anything and just

2283
01:47:34,420 --> 01:47:36,920
waits for the protagonist to come back to like initiate a

2284
01:47:36,920 --> 01:47:37,819
new conversation.

2285
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:38,899
It's okay.

2286
01:47:38,899 --> 01:47:39,300
Hold on.

2287
01:47:40,550 --> 01:47:42,149
Yeah, it looks like the great wall.

2288
01:47:42,550 --> 01:47:42,949
Okay.

2289
01:47:42,949 --> 01:47:43,850
Yeah, I see it.

2290
01:47:43,850 --> 01:47:44,949
But okay, hold on.

2291
01:47:44,949 --> 01:47:45,550
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2292
01:47:48,260 --> 01:47:50,659
It's behind the big gargoyle thing.

2293
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:51,359
Okay.

2294
01:47:59,590 --> 01:48:00,090
I know where it is.

2295
01:48:00,090 --> 01:48:02,689
No, but can I even get there without getting attacked?

2296
01:48:03,619 --> 01:48:10,880
Oh my God.

2297
01:48:27,069 --> 01:48:28,470
Please don't kill me.

2298
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:41,800
This is kind of fucking impossible when that dog is there

2299
01:48:41,899 --> 01:48:43,399
and so much shit.

2300
01:48:44,899 --> 01:48:45,300
Okay.

2301
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:46,399
Okay.

2302
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:50,239
I banished you which clears the debuffs.

2303
01:48:51,590 --> 01:48:52,489
Oh, that's smart.

2304
01:48:52,989 --> 01:48:55,189
So we can like, I don't know if you want to we can try on

2305
01:48:55,189 --> 01:48:55,890
our own.

2306
01:48:56,289 --> 01:48:58,989
If one of us gets to the Millennia we can fight Millennia.

2307
01:48:59,390 --> 01:49:00,989
Oh, that's actually wait.

2308
01:49:00,989 --> 01:49:01,989
What did I just get ported to?

2309
01:49:06,060 --> 01:49:06,659
Why am I here?

2310
01:49:14,819 --> 01:49:18,520
We have to get killed at the karya gate again.

2311
01:49:20,319 --> 01:49:21,020
Oh you do.

2312
01:49:21,020 --> 01:49:22,220
I first tried the jump.

2313
01:49:22,220 --> 01:49:22,819
I'm going.

2314
01:49:24,760 --> 01:49:24,960
All right.

2315
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:26,760
Well, let's see if you can get there in the meantime.

2316
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:27,760
I'm going to relax.

2317
01:49:35,479 --> 01:49:35,979
I hear that.

2318
01:49:35,979 --> 01:49:36,779
There's a dog.

2319
01:49:39,239 --> 01:49:41,239
There is and it's awful.

2320
01:49:49,930 --> 01:49:51,430
You don't need to you can just go to the place.

2321
01:49:52,829 --> 01:49:54,630
We cannot get the key.

2322
01:49:54,829 --> 01:49:55,829
None of the doors open.

2323
01:49:57,199 --> 01:49:59,800
This entire zone is closed off.

2324
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:03,079
I think we have to kill Millennia.

2325
01:50:03,279 --> 01:50:03,979
One of us does.

2326
01:50:08,989 --> 01:50:10,590
You can skip Millennia, but it's hard.

2327
01:50:13,420 --> 01:50:15,520
But your drink sounds like a Minecraft skeleton.

2328
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:27,220
Go through Volcano Manor normally.

2329
01:50:28,260 --> 01:50:30,159
I that's not possible.

2330
01:50:34,289 --> 01:50:50,960
I don't know where I am up the ladder.

2331
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:52,159
On the normal exit.

2332
01:50:52,159 --> 01:50:53,060
I'm going to set up the ladder.

2333
01:50:53,060 --> 01:50:55,859
You can jump to the right onto a ledge and then open the door

2334
01:50:55,859 --> 01:50:57,060
from the inside.

2335
01:51:05,409 --> 01:51:05,810
Okay.

2336
01:51:05,810 --> 01:51:06,909
Let me see if I can do this.

2337
01:51:12,119 --> 01:51:15,819
I am I'm cooking.

2338
01:51:16,930 --> 01:51:17,430
I'm cooking.

2339
01:51:17,430 --> 01:51:17,829
I'm cooking.

2340
01:51:17,829 --> 01:51:18,630
Did you get the ladder?

2341
01:51:19,029 --> 01:51:21,130
I found I went all the way around a bloodhound steps.

2342
01:51:21,130 --> 01:51:23,930
I just dashed the lava like way way away to the back and I

2343
01:51:23,930 --> 01:51:24,829
found one of the elevators.

2344
01:51:25,229 --> 01:51:25,529
Okay.

2345
01:51:26,130 --> 01:51:27,430
Do you have a bonfire?

2346
01:51:28,130 --> 01:51:30,630
I got hit out of the elevator by the one enemy that's in this

2347
01:51:30,630 --> 01:51:31,029
area.

2348
01:51:32,029 --> 01:51:32,930
So you didn't make it.

2349
01:51:33,430 --> 01:51:36,430
I'm I'm currently in the process of making it.

2350
01:51:37,029 --> 01:51:37,329
Okay.

2351
01:51:37,329 --> 01:51:39,029
Well, just you focus don't even talk to me.

2352
01:51:39,029 --> 01:51:39,529
Just do it.

2353
01:51:54,310 --> 01:51:54,810
I made it.

2354
01:51:55,109 --> 01:51:56,109
I know where I am.

2355
01:51:56,409 --> 01:51:58,810
Okay, so you made it up the ladder and you made it up to

2356
01:51:58,810 --> 01:52:00,010
the place we need where we need to be.

2357
01:52:02,010 --> 01:52:03,710
Yes, join me.

2358
01:52:04,310 --> 01:52:06,510
I don't appreciate you making fun of me.

2359
01:52:10,449 --> 01:52:11,149
Say less.

2360
01:52:11,149 --> 01:52:12,550
Oh, it gave me all the debuffs again.

2361
01:52:12,550 --> 01:52:13,750
Once I opened up my world.

2362
01:52:14,720 --> 01:52:17,319
It did it did so maybe I should close it.

2363
01:52:17,319 --> 01:52:18,220
Oh, wait a minute.

2364
01:52:18,220 --> 01:52:18,720
Hold on.

2365
01:52:21,359 --> 01:52:24,359
I'm just going to try and find a bonfire find a bonfire.

2366
01:52:24,359 --> 01:52:25,560
That's the most important thing.

2367
01:52:28,869 --> 01:52:30,770
All these motherfuckers just waiting for me.

2368
01:52:30,869 --> 01:52:31,369
Whatever.

2369
01:52:43,319 --> 01:52:48,279
I was gonna wait for you to do it and then I go up this

2370
01:52:48,279 --> 01:52:54,579
elevator the dog.

2371
01:52:55,079 --> 01:52:58,680
Just wait, you know, I'm gonna just lose the dog is going

2372
01:52:58,680 --> 01:52:59,279
to kill you.

2373
01:53:00,340 --> 01:53:01,539
I went a different way.

2374
01:53:03,510 --> 01:53:04,409
I skipped the dog.

2375
01:53:04,409 --> 01:53:05,409
I did dog skip.

2376
01:53:05,609 --> 01:53:06,810
Oh you did dog really?

2377
01:53:07,939 --> 01:53:09,539
I'm at the gate to Millennia.

2378
01:53:09,539 --> 01:53:13,180
Okay, so just be on the lookout for a bonfire and just

2379
01:53:13,180 --> 01:53:14,380
sit on it when you get there.

2380
01:53:15,699 --> 01:53:17,199
Can you still do the bridge jump?

2381
01:53:28,289 --> 01:53:31,789
I said you can but it's really really hard bridge jump

2382
01:53:31,789 --> 01:53:32,789
is not as hard.

2383
01:53:34,090 --> 01:53:36,390
I remember when they patched it and then I also remember

2384
01:53:36,390 --> 01:53:37,890
people still doing it the same day.

2385
01:53:40,859 --> 01:53:42,359
But it did look very hard.

2386
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:45,819
How did you do dog skip and you didn't climb up the

2387
01:53:45,819 --> 01:53:46,119
ladder?

2388
01:53:46,119 --> 01:53:49,119
I went all the way to left through the lava.

2389
01:53:49,119 --> 01:53:51,619
I bloodhound steps through all the lava didn't go through

2390
01:53:51,619 --> 01:53:52,220
the town.

2391
01:53:55,819 --> 01:53:57,220
I was gonna kill all these motherfuckers.

2392
01:53:57,220 --> 01:54:02,539
I'm gonna kill the dog come fight me over here.

2393
01:54:26,239 --> 01:54:27,239
Do I hear a bonfire?

2394
01:54:28,140 --> 01:54:30,640
What is shooting me through the fucking wall, dude?

2395
01:54:46,460 --> 01:54:47,460
That was so stupid.

2396
01:54:47,460 --> 01:54:48,560
Why did I do that?

2397
01:54:52,060 --> 01:54:54,859
This is the worst place to fight this fucking boss.

2398
01:54:56,159 --> 01:54:58,659
This is such a shitty place to do this.

2399
01:54:59,460 --> 01:54:59,960
He's like

2400
01:55:03,729 --> 01:55:05,329
he's just fucked up.

2401
01:55:09,489 --> 01:55:10,590
Oh no, that's the bug.

2402
01:55:10,590 --> 01:55:11,489
Why did I jump down?

2403
01:55:11,489 --> 01:55:12,390
Because I don't know.

2404
01:55:12,390 --> 01:55:16,090
I was just like too lazy to I'm so done with this area.

2405
01:55:16,489 --> 01:55:29,800
I just I'm just waiting to skip over Worcester is the dog

2406
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:31,899
enemy does that thing where they jump in the air and they

2407
01:55:31,899 --> 01:55:35,000
just like leap across the whole game and he's just doing

2408
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,100
that in random spots where there's like no way to go.

2409
01:55:43,479 --> 01:55:44,479
I'm killing this dog.

2410
01:55:49,100 --> 01:55:50,500
I'm killing this dog right now.

2411
01:55:57,449 --> 01:56:00,850
I'm clearing this entire zone and then me and this stupid

2412
01:56:00,850 --> 01:56:02,149
ass dog are gonna have a fight.

2413
01:56:02,750 --> 01:56:06,949
I think I'm near a grave, but I can't remember exactly

2414
01:56:06,949 --> 01:56:07,250
where it is.

2415
01:56:07,250 --> 01:56:07,850
I'm scared.

2416
01:56:07,850 --> 01:56:08,649
I'm stuck now.

2417
01:56:10,420 --> 01:56:11,920
I think it's like in here to the left.

2418
01:56:16,439 --> 01:56:18,939
Somebody shoot me from arrows of across the whole game.

2419
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:22,159
It's almost like this is completely random.

2420
01:56:22,460 --> 01:56:23,260
Who would have thought?

2421
01:56:29,430 --> 01:56:31,130
I could just equip my ninjitsu.

2422
01:56:31,329 --> 01:56:32,329
I run fast.

2423
01:56:36,619 --> 01:56:37,220
Fuck this.

2424
01:56:44,050 --> 01:56:48,750
Fuck albanerk throwing fucking Krillin's Destructo disc.

2425
01:56:51,489 --> 01:56:53,689
Yo, I know there's one down here.

2426
01:56:53,689 --> 01:56:54,989
I'm so glad you're as upset as I am.

2427
01:56:56,739 --> 01:56:58,140
I'm just so lost.

2428
01:56:58,439 --> 01:57:01,239
I feel like I've walked past like three bonfires.

2429
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:05,439
Get up here.

2430
01:57:07,529 --> 01:57:08,930
I'm not fucking around right now.

2431
01:57:08,930 --> 01:57:09,630
Get up here.

2432
01:57:26,399 --> 01:57:26,800
I did it.

2433
01:57:26,899 --> 01:57:27,399
I got a great.

2434
01:57:27,699 --> 01:57:28,100
I did it.

2435
01:57:28,399 --> 01:57:28,899
I did it.

2436
01:57:30,130 --> 01:57:30,630
No.

2437
01:57:48,359 --> 01:57:50,199
Okay, I'm opening my world to you.

2438
01:57:58,409 --> 01:58:01,210
It is super incredibly super laggy here because there's

2439
01:58:01,210 --> 01:58:02,710
another bird with her head in the ceiling.

2440
01:58:03,409 --> 01:58:04,909
And I just imagine all the birds are girls.

2441
01:58:04,909 --> 01:58:06,210
I don't know if that's like a problem.

2442
01:58:06,510 --> 01:58:09,210
I don't know if like that's something I need to take back.

2443
01:58:09,909 --> 01:58:11,810
I'm so fucking mad right now.

2444
01:58:18,359 --> 01:58:25,510
Jerma Jerma you just got exercised Jerma.

2445
01:58:28,210 --> 01:58:29,710
I am joining your world right now.

2446
01:58:29,710 --> 01:58:32,409
Okay, I'm concerned because there's been a couple times

2447
01:58:32,409 --> 01:58:34,609
in recent history where you like don't hear anything I say.

2448
01:58:35,210 --> 01:58:35,510
All right.

2449
01:58:35,510 --> 01:58:36,310
Here I am.

2450
01:58:36,310 --> 01:58:37,010
What's up?

2451
01:58:37,010 --> 01:58:38,210
Oh, thank goodness.

2452
01:58:39,180 --> 01:58:40,680
You have no idea guys.

2453
01:58:40,680 --> 01:58:43,880
Welcome back from Elden Ring gameplay me and that dog down

2454
01:58:43,880 --> 01:58:44,279
there.

2455
01:58:44,279 --> 01:58:45,479
I've got a bone to pick with that dog.

2456
01:58:45,779 --> 01:58:51,590
I'm just saying I we need to go kill that dog at some point.

2457
01:58:53,079 --> 01:58:55,579
I think I open the shortcut to the dog to our right.

2458
01:58:55,579 --> 01:58:56,979
Oh, this is so bad.

2459
01:58:56,979 --> 01:58:57,380
Yeah.

2460
01:58:57,380 --> 01:58:58,979
What if something's here right to our left?

2461
01:58:58,979 --> 01:59:01,079
There's a that bird has its head in the ceiling.

2462
01:59:16,399 --> 01:59:17,600
Okay, please go away.

2463
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:18,000
All right.

2464
01:59:20,640 --> 01:59:24,279
So all right, that was fun.

2465
01:59:29,479 --> 01:59:32,880
Oh dude, he's three-fingered of the frenzied flag to you.

2466
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:33,680
Did you see that?

2467
01:59:34,079 --> 01:59:35,979
That's really cool that you would take my joke.

2468
01:59:36,380 --> 01:59:36,779
Yep.

2469
01:59:40,430 --> 01:59:42,930
Yeah, I think if you really want to kill the dog, it's the

2470
01:59:42,930 --> 01:59:45,529
shortcut door what they were saying to climb the ladder,

2471
01:59:45,529 --> 01:59:46,630
but this door was closed.

2472
01:59:46,630 --> 01:59:47,329
This is the ladder.

2473
01:59:47,329 --> 01:59:49,329
And this is the ladder and this was locked.

2474
01:59:49,829 --> 01:59:50,930
Yeah, dogs down there.

2475
01:59:50,930 --> 01:59:52,430
So I was doing that for pretty much no reason.

2476
01:59:52,430 --> 01:59:53,630
I would have had to go around the whole thing.

2477
01:59:53,729 --> 01:59:56,130
Oh man, no, then you come in here.

2478
01:59:56,430 --> 01:59:57,630
Do you want to fight the dog?

2479
01:59:57,829 --> 01:59:58,729
Do you not care?

2480
01:59:58,829 --> 02:00:00,430
Do you like killing dogs?

2481
02:00:03,550 --> 02:00:04,850
I'm going to give the dog a name.

2482
02:00:05,050 --> 02:00:05,850
That's Ralphie.

2483
02:00:06,729 --> 02:00:07,729
Oh, that's cool.

2484
02:00:07,729 --> 02:00:08,930
No, I like Ralphie.

2485
02:00:10,149 --> 02:00:10,649
All right, let's go.

2486
02:00:10,649 --> 02:00:12,949
Yeah, Ralphie just like he was protecting his area.

2487
02:00:12,949 --> 02:00:16,149
But now that like he knows you he like warmed up to you.

2488
02:00:16,149 --> 02:00:17,649
It's left this way other way.

2489
02:00:19,380 --> 02:00:28,439
Oh, that's a cool dog is Ralphie.

2490
02:00:28,439 --> 02:00:29,840
Yeah, talk like it.

2491
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:31,239
Yes.

2492
02:00:31,539 --> 02:00:32,840
I love that character now.

2493
02:00:34,710 --> 02:00:36,710
I don't even I have no problem with that character at all.

2494
02:00:41,439 --> 02:00:44,840
Now this guy's name is Craig and he's a fucking tax auditor.

2495
02:00:45,640 --> 02:00:46,039
What?

2496
02:00:51,060 --> 02:00:53,359
Wait, who when you're fighting right now?

2497
02:00:53,859 --> 02:00:55,060
No, the guy you just killed.

2498
02:00:55,560 --> 02:00:59,770
Oh guy.

2499
02:00:59,770 --> 02:01:02,770
I killed his Krillin wannabe Krillin.

2500
02:01:03,569 --> 02:01:06,569
Yeah from Dragon Ball Z.

2501
02:01:07,859 --> 02:01:08,960
No, this is barf drinker.

2502
02:01:09,460 --> 02:01:12,159
He was throwing the light disks.

2503
02:01:12,760 --> 02:01:14,260
I've never seen an albino do it.

2504
02:01:15,060 --> 02:01:15,960
I don't know why he's doing it.

2505
02:01:21,789 --> 02:01:23,289
Destructo disk.

2506
02:01:32,520 --> 02:01:40,100
So this character's name is where did you go up the stairs?

2507
02:01:40,899 --> 02:01:43,770
Okay, this character.

2508
02:01:43,869 --> 02:01:44,569
This is it.

2509
02:01:45,810 --> 02:01:50,510
This is glow blob and Snaily and their best friends and they

2510
02:01:50,510 --> 02:02:01,279
are doing come up with a better backstory.

2511
02:02:22,699 --> 02:02:23,600
Not cool.

2512
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:26,659
What did it be really epic?

2513
02:02:27,260 --> 02:02:29,359
No, I thought this guy's a statue.

2514
02:02:32,380 --> 02:02:35,380
What would be epic if I could take my hat off and use it like

2515
02:02:35,380 --> 02:02:35,979
a shield?

2516
02:02:38,430 --> 02:02:39,130
That would be pretty cool.

2517
02:02:44,300 --> 02:02:45,600
Oh, I got lightning Ram.

2518
02:02:50,630 --> 02:02:59,399
Careful careful.

2519
02:02:59,399 --> 02:03:00,800
I ran this whole way.

2520
02:03:01,399 --> 02:03:07,020
You did you need a better backstory for that hat stir.

2521
02:03:07,020 --> 02:03:11,119
Yeah, I don't know why this is a foggy because it's one of

2522
02:03:11,119 --> 02:03:12,920
those keys.

2523
02:03:14,119 --> 02:03:15,920
Oh the kiss me keys.

2524
02:03:23,060 --> 02:03:36,500
Wait, why can I not attack what a coherent array of enemies?

2525
02:03:40,039 --> 02:03:42,239
Oh my god, I'm gonna fucking die.

2526
02:03:44,390 --> 02:03:45,890
Guy has like a super sword.

2527
02:03:46,090 --> 02:03:47,489
You just hear a car horn.

2528
02:03:49,649 --> 02:03:51,250
I think it was somebody blowing a horn up here.

2529
02:03:52,569 --> 02:03:55,069
I thought like I heard like a truck on the highway.

2530
02:03:55,369 --> 02:04:09,210
So there is an item in here, but I don't know it was worth using

2531
02:04:09,210 --> 02:04:13,510
the key but none of these gargoyles are worth using keys

2532
02:04:13,510 --> 02:04:15,310
on because I got the painting.

2533
02:04:17,619 --> 02:04:19,920
I got the dragon scale blade.

2534
02:04:20,319 --> 02:04:21,119
That sounds pretty cool.

2535
02:04:22,090 --> 02:04:23,689
Yeah, I don't I don't remember that item.

2536
02:04:30,600 --> 02:04:39,260
Okay, so millennia I guess is the plan.

2537
02:04:39,359 --> 02:04:42,789
I am millennia blade of Micola.

2538
02:04:45,109 --> 02:04:57,920
Now that's not good.

2539
02:04:59,739 --> 02:05:02,340
Just kind of came you look like you came out of the actual

2540
02:05:02,340 --> 02:05:03,439
stone from the wall.

2541
02:05:06,239 --> 02:05:07,239
He's not doing anything.

2542
02:05:08,239 --> 02:05:09,239
He's got a lot of health.

2543
02:05:09,340 --> 02:05:12,140
I don't it's not worth it for the fucking bin beast bones.

2544
02:05:12,140 --> 02:05:13,239
We're gonna get for killing this guy.

2545
02:05:16,460 --> 02:05:17,060
Coward.

2546
02:05:17,359 --> 02:05:17,859
Okay.

2547
02:05:19,409 --> 02:05:21,510
I actually I don't I don't like this.

2548
02:05:21,710 --> 02:05:22,409
I'm dead.

2549
02:05:23,739 --> 02:05:26,140
I was there was a wizard behind me.

2550
02:05:26,739 --> 02:05:29,239
I don't know where he came from because we cleared everything

2551
02:05:29,640 --> 02:05:36,550
but I turned around and there was a wizard isn't that much

2552
02:05:36,550 --> 02:05:41,369
health but don't think it's worth it.

2553
02:05:41,869 --> 02:05:42,670
But here I am.

2554
02:05:42,970 --> 02:05:43,569
Nonetheless.

2555
02:05:44,609 --> 02:05:45,710
Oh, it's this one.

2556
02:05:45,710 --> 02:05:46,710
Oh, never mind.

2557
02:05:47,750 --> 02:05:48,649
I don't want to fight this fucking thing.

2558
02:05:48,649 --> 02:05:50,949
This is the other this is the second one when there's a

2559
02:05:50,949 --> 02:05:51,850
little lightning moves.

2560
02:05:52,750 --> 02:05:54,260
Dying.

2561
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:55,060
Uh-huh.

2562
02:05:56,439 --> 02:05:56,939
Don't die.

2563
02:05:58,520 --> 02:05:59,319
Just don't do it.

2564
02:05:59,619 --> 02:06:00,619
Okay, just say no.

2565
02:06:01,020 --> 02:06:01,319
All right.

2566
02:06:01,319 --> 02:06:02,319
I'm not going to die.

2567
02:06:09,430 --> 02:06:09,930
I'm dead.

2568
02:06:10,729 --> 02:06:11,930
I mean, it's kind of not.

2569
02:06:12,899 --> 02:06:13,100
I don't know.

2570
02:06:13,100 --> 02:06:14,300
Why did we fight him?

2571
02:06:14,399 --> 02:06:16,300
You were so you wanted to fight him so bad.

2572
02:06:16,899 --> 02:06:18,100
I didn't know there was a wizard.

2573
02:06:20,340 --> 02:06:21,739
He is a wizard.

2574
02:06:25,100 --> 02:06:27,100
I'm holding this deep off because I was coming back to

2575
02:06:27,100 --> 02:06:27,600
help.

2576
02:06:33,430 --> 02:06:34,229
Oh god damn it.

2577
02:06:34,229 --> 02:06:37,430
The fucking big turkey thing is back and everything lags.

2578
02:06:39,710 --> 02:06:41,409
Yeah, and then and then you rest it.

2579
02:06:41,909 --> 02:06:42,810
That's real cool.

2580
02:06:43,109 --> 02:06:44,810
You would you would rest.

2581
02:06:45,109 --> 02:06:48,640
I just this place sucks.

2582
02:06:49,239 --> 02:06:51,460
You're fighting a turkey alone.

2583
02:06:52,430 --> 02:06:55,229
I have to kill this thing like I just do right.

2584
02:06:57,869 --> 02:06:58,270
Yeah.

2585
02:07:13,020 --> 02:07:13,920
Okay, it's dead.

2586
02:07:19,319 --> 02:07:19,619
All right.

2587
02:07:21,510 --> 02:07:23,909
I have I don't it's I have not burned into my short-term

2588
02:07:23,909 --> 02:07:27,510
memory where to go at all in this fucking goddamn maze

2589
02:07:27,510 --> 02:07:29,909
of a place up the stairs.

2590
02:07:32,039 --> 02:07:44,029
And then you're basically there being gate kept.

2591
02:07:44,029 --> 02:07:45,729
He's going after Ralphie.

2592
02:07:46,529 --> 02:07:47,329
Don't say that.

2593
02:07:58,449 --> 02:07:59,350
All right, let's move.

2594
02:08:00,920 --> 02:08:01,819
All right, squat up.

2595
02:08:01,819 --> 02:08:03,020
We don't want to get three-fingered.

2596
02:08:07,439 --> 02:08:09,239
I went right by my head, dude.

2597
02:08:09,239 --> 02:08:11,340
Please watch where you're casting your spells.

2598
02:08:11,340 --> 02:08:12,340
I didn't mean to press that.

2599
02:08:12,340 --> 02:08:13,340
I don't know what I pressed.

2600
02:08:16,720 --> 02:08:19,619
I just turned to you and looked and all of my eyebrows

2601
02:08:19,619 --> 02:08:20,020
were gone.

2602
02:08:21,180 --> 02:08:21,680
Like Mike.

2603
02:08:21,779 --> 02:08:23,680
I just turned and looked as excuse me.

2604
02:08:24,180 --> 02:08:25,579
It was right by my face.

2605
02:08:25,779 --> 02:08:26,279
Oh shit.

2606
02:08:26,279 --> 02:08:26,779
He's back.

2607
02:08:26,779 --> 02:08:27,279
I forgot.

2608
02:08:27,380 --> 02:08:29,079
All right, just leave just leave don't even fight it.

2609
02:08:29,880 --> 02:08:30,279
Okay.

2610
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:40,399
Okay.

2611
02:08:41,100 --> 02:08:43,699
Oh, I know it's annoying from downtown.

2612
02:08:43,699 --> 02:08:46,399
I was trying to lose him up and you can't be serious.

2613
02:08:46,800 --> 02:08:48,300
I refuse to die from that.

2614
02:08:50,199 --> 02:08:52,399
I don't know when he's going to cast this thing and it's like

2615
02:08:52,600 --> 02:08:53,399
I can hear it.

2616
02:08:53,399 --> 02:08:55,800
It's like fucking sizzling like bacon in a pan.

2617
02:08:57,039 --> 02:08:59,779
It's like and then it happens.

2618
02:09:05,479 --> 02:09:09,380
I don't know if there's a closer rest, but that's millennia.

2619
02:09:09,779 --> 02:09:10,180
All right.

2620
02:09:10,579 --> 02:09:12,380
Hopefully it's just a phase one.

2621
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:15,359
Hopefully it's just a phase mom.

2622
02:09:15,659 --> 02:09:16,359
It's just phase one.

2623
02:09:16,359 --> 02:09:20,659
Then we should be all right and you very famously beat millennia

2624
02:09:20,659 --> 02:09:21,560
without a problem at all.

2625
02:09:21,560 --> 02:09:22,659
So I'm leaving this up to you.

2626
02:09:23,260 --> 02:09:25,859
You'll be my mimic tear except worse.

2627
02:10:02,590 --> 02:10:03,390
I'm so slow.

2628
02:10:03,390 --> 02:10:04,789
I still have the debuff.

2629
02:10:10,920 --> 02:10:11,819
Oh this thing.

2630
02:10:17,760 --> 02:10:18,560
I'm dead, dude.

2631
02:10:22,189 --> 02:10:23,390
I forgot she could do that.

2632
02:10:30,689 --> 02:10:37,050
Yeah, I really haven't seen her moveset in a hot minute.

2633
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:40,840
It is just for Neo.

2634
02:10:40,840 --> 02:10:42,140
I would have fucking rolled her.

2635
02:10:46,239 --> 02:10:49,779
I hope this is the phase two then we're in a lot of trouble.

2636
02:10:53,859 --> 02:10:55,859
It actually might be impossible to dodge it in this room.

2637
02:10:58,060 --> 02:10:58,960
I have a new strategy.

2638
02:11:01,659 --> 02:11:02,460
Here's the strategy.

2639
02:11:03,220 --> 02:11:10,010
You hear me loading a new strap.

2640
02:11:10,010 --> 02:11:10,710
We get there.

2641
02:11:10,710 --> 02:11:12,909
We don't have a debuff because I was like, I don't know.

2642
02:11:12,909 --> 02:11:14,109
I had like a move speed debuff.

2643
02:11:14,109 --> 02:11:17,609
So all my rolls were like slowed behind the pillar when she

2644
02:11:17,609 --> 02:11:20,710
winds up with that actually stop her from attacking him.

2645
02:11:21,890 --> 02:11:22,890
She could get stuck on him.

2646
02:11:22,890 --> 02:11:24,390
Yeah on kill the lag bird.

2647
02:11:39,800 --> 02:11:41,500
There's got to be a closer bonfire.

2648
02:11:42,479 --> 02:11:43,579
It might not be.

2649
02:11:44,869 --> 02:11:47,569
I think lifting up the bridge is like the way to do a short

2650
02:11:47,569 --> 02:11:48,069
cut here.

2651
02:11:50,479 --> 02:11:52,880
Just do a kite around the pillar.

2652
02:11:53,279 --> 02:11:54,579
Yeah, I was thinking just DPS.

2653
02:11:54,579 --> 02:11:58,180
I was thinking just just R1 R1 R1 because she staggers.

2654
02:11:59,439 --> 02:12:00,039
Excuse me.

2655
02:12:00,539 --> 02:12:01,840
Oh, it's fucking Barry.

2656
02:12:02,039 --> 02:12:02,840
He's blocked it.

2657
02:12:03,939 --> 02:12:05,739
Or whatever his name was Barry.

2658
02:12:06,239 --> 02:12:07,039
Clamula.

2659
02:12:07,039 --> 02:12:07,640
I don't know.

2660
02:12:09,640 --> 02:12:10,640
I didn't give them names.

2661
02:12:10,640 --> 02:12:11,840
You killed them before I could.

2662
02:12:12,340 --> 02:12:13,140
Oh, no, no, no, no.

2663
02:12:13,140 --> 02:12:19,319
It was named it was like slimy or something.

2664
02:12:19,520 --> 02:12:24,840
I don't know the elevator cage will get back here faster, but

2665
02:12:24,840 --> 02:12:25,939
we're not going to have to worry about it because we're going

2666
02:12:25,939 --> 02:12:34,850
to finish it right now is the strategy is seriously just like

2667
02:12:34,850 --> 02:12:36,149
one try millennia right now.

2668
02:12:37,050 --> 02:12:40,050
I kind of think it has to be because last try doesn't count

2669
02:12:40,050 --> 02:12:41,649
and people think it counts and that's kind of weird.

2670
02:12:42,529 --> 02:12:47,920
But like we had debuffs and it didn't count if there is just

2671
02:12:47,920 --> 02:12:50,119
a phase one that would be huge, but I don't think it is.

2672
02:12:51,989 --> 02:12:53,489
You've never even seen this boss before.

2673
02:12:53,489 --> 02:12:53,890
What is it?

2674
02:12:57,840 --> 02:13:00,399
What did that to me?

2675
02:13:00,500 --> 02:13:02,699
What way he's coming?

2676
02:13:04,119 --> 02:13:04,619
He's got.

2677
02:13:04,619 --> 02:13:05,420
Oh my God.

2678
02:13:05,420 --> 02:13:07,619
He is that was such a horrible feeling.

2679
02:13:08,020 --> 02:13:15,739
He's been that close the whole time and we didn't even

2680
02:13:15,739 --> 02:13:17,460
we were just nonchalantly just kind of running.

2681
02:13:19,159 --> 02:13:19,659
All right.

2682
02:13:20,430 --> 02:13:20,729
All right.

2683
02:13:20,729 --> 02:13:21,029
Come on.

2684
02:13:21,029 --> 02:13:21,630
Let's do it.

2685
02:13:23,590 --> 02:13:26,090
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait saying

2686
02:13:26,090 --> 02:13:32,079
The this is faster apparently and we don't have to worry about that fucking horse guy

2687
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:41,369
Is it faster though? Get in here. Is there a bonfire down there? Oh, it's there get in here. Get in get in

2688
02:13:41,890 --> 02:13:52,609
There I mean, I'm this is down. Oh

2689
02:13:55,130 --> 02:14:00,409
Yeah, oh, I know what they mean. We would go down by the dog and then run up here

2690
02:14:00,810 --> 02:14:02,810
Because we open the shortcut by the ladder

2691
02:14:04,479 --> 02:14:07,310
Okay, then you run up around this way and you avoid

2692
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:12,840
It's still pretty not it's still pretty it's comparable

2693
02:14:13,439 --> 02:14:31,369
Back by the bridge. All right. Well, let's do it. I just win just win. Aren't you like big into parries?

2694
02:14:32,050 --> 02:14:39,710
Yeah, you want me to parry her? No, I know you're gonna start and you're gonna be mad because I told you to do it

2695
02:14:39,710 --> 02:14:42,789
You'd be like you told me to parry and I haven't practiced

2696
02:14:43,229 --> 02:15:01,949
Get these benches out of the way so we can actually when she goes in the air just hide behind a pillar

2697
02:15:02,470 --> 02:15:30,250
We just use the pillars regardless just hide behind them. Why'd you tell me to parry? That's what I'm saying. That's a don't

2698
02:15:31,010 --> 02:15:38,949
What the fuck?

2699
02:15:42,060 --> 02:15:43,420
You good

2700
02:15:43,420 --> 02:15:56,939
She went for the grab to grab you and she grabbed like the side of my ear and fucking skewered me

2701
02:15:56,939 --> 02:16:08,800
I hate this boss so much. I think on a good day. I wouldn't be worried. It's not a good day. I

2702
02:16:10,319 --> 02:16:13,800
Want to block everything she's doing and you're not allowed to block in this game

2703
02:16:13,800 --> 02:16:19,279
I'm just so paranoid that she's gonna do the stupid water dance. It's gonna one-shot us. So I'm just playing so timidly and

2704
02:16:19,920 --> 02:16:25,000
Then she grabs you by my ear and just picks me up and sticks the sword through my stomach

2705
02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:35,690
It's only one phase though

2706
02:16:36,370 --> 02:16:47,420
Out this way and then we have to go I forget

2707
02:16:49,389 --> 02:16:51,389
Boogers just came out of my nose

2708
02:16:52,370 --> 02:16:56,850
Boogie boogers just like shot out of my nose because it's like this is we're picking to go this way

2709
02:16:57,370 --> 02:17:01,489
Deliberately and I don't know why because this is gonna be way worse than the other way

2710
02:17:02,809 --> 02:17:06,649
This is wrong. Look at how much worse this is. It's just Ralphie. I

2711
02:17:07,290 --> 02:17:12,450
Just don't know where to go. Why did you go this way? Why did you go this weird-ass way?

2712
02:17:13,250 --> 02:17:15,250
Which way you supposed to go?

2713
02:17:15,450 --> 02:17:16,809
wait

2714
02:17:16,809 --> 02:17:23,229
Well, I don't know you decided I didn't want to come this way I was like, oh, I don't think we should do this

2715
02:17:23,229 --> 02:17:31,629
Oh up this way. I don't want my dog. He's a nice dog. He just doesn't know you

2716
02:17:32,149 --> 02:17:47,540
Actually, this might be better. I don't like the synchronized elevator. Yeah, that's gonna mess us up at some point. I think I

2717
02:17:54,520 --> 02:17:59,440
Spent like four hours fighting millennia at least

2718
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,920
This is this is like a thing. I don't ever want to see again

2719
02:18:02,920 --> 02:18:05,520
I think I actually said after I beat millennia see in the regular game

2720
02:18:05,559 --> 02:18:07,479
I was like, yeah, I'm never doing this ever again

2721
02:18:07,479 --> 02:18:11,680
I would beat the whole area cuz like that that Halleke tree area is pretty cool

2722
02:18:11,760 --> 02:18:15,440
But before getting to this fog gate, I would just leave on any other playthrough

2723
02:18:16,159 --> 02:18:18,969
Well, it's not any other playthrough

2724
02:18:19,930 --> 02:18:24,670
It's the playthrough. It was way more than four hours. It was like 14

2725
02:18:25,590 --> 02:18:27,469
No, it was not

2726
02:18:27,469 --> 02:18:34,379
Yeah, I don't even know what buttons

2727
02:18:34,780 --> 02:18:54,129
The strategy good strategy careful get back. She's gonna go in the air. She's gonna go in the air. I had behind a pillar

2728
02:18:59,969 --> 02:19:07,319
Nice. Nice. Just keep doing wait. She's gonna go up here. She's up. She's up

2729
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:14,590
She's gonna come for you. She doesn't give a shit. It kind of works. It kind of works

2730
02:19:15,309 --> 02:19:26,700
Not doing it again. Are you how many fucking times do you do that? It works though? It works. You just can't get close. I

2731
02:19:32,840 --> 02:19:35,840
Just can't even drink out of my fucking flask. I

2732
02:19:36,399 --> 02:19:44,370
Hate this boss so much just delete it from the fucking whole game. It works. It works

2733
02:19:44,370 --> 02:19:53,579
I mean, I thought we were gonna fight her you were hiding most of the fight because and I survived but then

2734
02:19:53,739 --> 02:20:00,610
She did that thing where oh you have you taken some damage, bro. Don't worry. I ain't gonna let you do shit

2735
02:20:00,610 --> 02:20:06,329
I'm just gonna be like right like right behind you the whole time and I'm gonna be swinging like every you know, one two

2736
02:20:06,649 --> 02:20:11,329
Three four one two don't you can't drink in this game. No, of course you're fighting millennia

2737
02:20:11,329 --> 02:20:13,850
Like just fuck just just turn around and run around just run away

2738
02:20:14,770 --> 02:20:19,639
We have the debuff. Did you sit down?

2739
02:20:19,719 --> 02:20:26,069
Do we think so when we both die? We don't get one. Oh, okay. I think we have no we don't

2740
02:20:26,670 --> 02:20:38,909
Fucking one guy. I hate millennia's entire move set. Oh my god. I've already wasted flasks

2741
02:20:40,729 --> 02:20:49,739
Reset it's a skill issue. I don't care. I don't care. Fuck that boss. I

2742
02:20:51,670 --> 02:20:55,469
Despise this boss. I hate this boss with a burning passion

2743
02:20:55,950 --> 02:21:10,809
It's the worst boss they've ever made. It's worse than better chaos. Come on. You hit me with that

2744
02:21:11,370 --> 02:21:31,420
All right, we're in worse than better chaos, dude. You okay?

2745
02:21:32,059 --> 02:21:42,629
We're winning you're gonna fight her and we're gonna win me and better chaos like smoke a blunt together and hang out and shit

2746
02:21:42,629 --> 02:21:47,819
Like me millennia. No, don't call me. I don't want to hang out. She can call me

2747
02:21:53,819 --> 02:21:56,190
Okay, let's do this, please

2748
02:21:57,870 --> 02:21:59,870
Nightmare blunt rotation

2749
02:22:05,100 --> 02:22:31,870
Whatever you're gonna fight her dude, I'm waiting for the opportunity you why did you jump?

2750
02:22:35,020 --> 02:22:43,250
Mode I'm on block her attacks and jump. All right, listen when she does the dance thing. Don't go too close to the pillar

2751
02:22:43,930 --> 02:22:47,200
It's just enough to like like keep it right here. Oh

2752
02:22:48,319 --> 02:22:52,959
No, oh no, the solution the solution's over. Oh, no

2753
02:22:53,479 --> 02:22:58,680
She was in the right spot. Can you play your own game and take your own advice next time dude? She was

2754
02:22:59,319 --> 02:23:01,319
Excuse me. What's happening here?

2755
02:23:02,280 --> 02:23:08,159
She from where she killed you she kept doing that move across the whole map

2756
02:23:08,840 --> 02:23:10,879
She did it backwards

2757
02:23:10,879 --> 02:23:20,819
It doesn't work. It does but it's you got to get it right her attack has that

2758
02:23:21,180 --> 02:23:25,719
Spot in the middle where it the circle has to be right in the middle of the pillar

2759
02:23:25,719 --> 02:23:40,829
I don't think we have to kill this bird if we go the other way. Maybe all right, maybe call me crazy

2760
02:23:42,200 --> 02:23:48,379
Let's just let's just attack her and just don't even let her do any moves

2761
02:23:52,360 --> 02:24:00,360
Dude I can't like this fucking way such asshole. It's do we just jump down into a rave

2762
02:24:05,040 --> 02:24:10,069
See what I was doing my only only jump attacks, right?

2763
02:24:10,069 --> 02:24:12,069
I

2764
02:24:12,670 --> 02:24:18,229
Rock to run around the pillars and just wait for you to do something. Can you scoot up a little I feel like I'm gonna fall

2765
02:24:18,989 --> 02:24:22,780
Okay

2766
02:24:22,780 --> 02:24:28,920
Jump attacks only I'm thinking and just try to get the stagger and then one of us does the attack

2767
02:24:29,180 --> 02:24:32,600
Let me put on that thing though. Where is it?

2768
02:24:33,459 --> 02:25:02,950
Okay, try to get the stagger. Don't even think about it. It's not even think just just going it kind of worked

2769
02:25:03,389 --> 02:25:16,229
God, dude

2770
02:25:16,229 --> 02:25:32,389
What the fuck working? It's working

2771
02:25:44,879 --> 02:25:52,239
That's mommy time. It's working

2772
02:25:56,399 --> 02:25:57,600
lagging

2773
02:25:57,600 --> 02:25:59,600
Like oh don't say that now

2774
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:07,629
lagging I

2775
02:26:07,629 --> 02:26:12,590
Why did I do that? What the fuck was I thinking? I could have jumped. Why did I do the fire move?

2776
02:26:12,590 --> 02:26:17,590
I wanted to be so flashy for no fucking reason. I don't know why you would use the fire move. I

2777
02:26:18,190 --> 02:26:21,430
Just figured I had an opportunity. I had isn't you could you got it. You got it

2778
02:26:21,430 --> 02:26:28,149
You got it. You're like that guy that killed millennia like 30,000 times that what the let me solo her

2779
02:26:28,149 --> 02:26:45,219
It's just channel that energy. You can do it. Okay, we strayed from the plan. I needed to run

2780
02:26:45,219 --> 02:26:49,459
I needed to just go into light stance and start running and get the better dodge

2781
02:26:49,680 --> 02:26:53,940
We had the strategy and it worked. I have a question

2782
02:26:54,180 --> 02:26:58,459
We took her down to half health with jump attacks and she didn't get staggered once what's going on?

2783
02:26:58,459 --> 02:27:06,139
Oh, you mean like neat like on the knee stagger. Just like boom. How come we can't get it?

2784
02:27:06,139 --> 02:27:10,059
Oh, yeah, and you have to parry her three times to get like an actual Barry

2785
02:27:10,459 --> 02:27:12,879
You oh, yeah, like yeah

2786
02:27:13,579 --> 02:27:24,360
Fuck that. I love going this way. You actually do and it's like it's annoying. I

2787
02:27:27,399 --> 02:27:30,290
like running

2788
02:27:30,290 --> 02:27:32,610
Nothing attacking you and just like watching your health bar

2789
02:27:33,290 --> 02:27:49,950
It actually works out sometimes though. I'm glad you expected me to be right behind you. I looked behind me

2790
02:27:53,760 --> 02:27:57,030
Without even turning my head. Okay. I am

2791
02:27:57,709 --> 02:28:00,950
millennia killer blade of Micaela killer

2792
02:28:01,430 --> 02:28:05,079
Let's just go I kill her

2793
02:28:06,469 --> 02:28:13,170
To do it when she goes up in the air. We are full sprinting to the other side of the Coliseum

2794
02:28:13,930 --> 02:28:15,190
Okay

2795
02:28:15,190 --> 02:28:37,530
Watch that stamina burn. Yeah people she cheated that was cheating. Oh

2796
02:28:44,770 --> 02:28:46,409
No

2797
02:28:46,409 --> 02:29:08,639
Whatever happened to run across the game. I mean we were both in the middle of attacks. It's fine

2798
02:29:08,639 --> 02:29:13,319
I've seen you do this once I

2799
02:29:13,399 --> 02:29:15,399
Never saw it actually

2800
02:29:15,639 --> 02:29:23,489
Watch out for the sword

2801
02:29:23,530 --> 02:29:25,530
brilliant brilliant

2802
02:29:25,649 --> 02:30:19,540
You did it twice in a fucking row that move is such horse shit twice in a row two times in a row two two

2803
02:30:19,780 --> 02:30:25,940
We have it. I feel like um, you know before when I called the jump before I made the jump

2804
02:30:25,940 --> 02:30:31,920
I feel it in my soul. This is the one you know, I'm saying that was bullshit

2805
02:30:31,959 --> 02:30:39,979
No, I want anybody and don't even talk about it. We don't even do that patience. Keep hitting her

2806
02:30:40,059 --> 02:30:42,530
You know, she when she's gonna go up we just run

2807
02:30:42,530 --> 02:30:49,879
I got distracted because she got she went down on her knees and she was like, please please kill me and like I

2808
02:30:50,780 --> 02:30:57,030
Couldn't say no, but now I know better. She didn't do that move twice in a row. I beat her I

2809
02:30:57,549 --> 02:31:04,170
Was in the zone. It's cuz we missed the stab

2810
02:31:04,170 --> 02:31:08,409
I thought you were gonna get the stab and then she was up too quick. Yeah, it's too quick

2811
02:31:08,770 --> 02:31:14,399
But like this time get a safe distance before you heal

2812
02:31:14,520 --> 02:31:16,639
Well, the problem is when she does that move twice in a row

2813
02:31:16,639 --> 02:31:20,200
She covers so much ground that even you just don't know what moves coming next

2814
02:31:20,319 --> 02:31:24,879
So you think about what what does she have in her arsenal and she just did that move?

2815
02:31:24,879 --> 02:31:27,860
So in your brain you go that's not happening a second time

2816
02:31:27,860 --> 02:31:28,799
She's gonna do something else

2817
02:31:28,799 --> 02:31:33,860
But if it happens twice in a row it throws off your brain and it's just like that's not good

2818
02:31:33,860 --> 02:31:40,670
I was nice you never expect the same move to happen twice in a row. You always like oh, yeah

2819
02:31:40,670 --> 02:31:43,829
I just dodged that so what's the next one? Let's go. Let's go

2820
02:31:44,549 --> 02:31:49,520
Jump jump on her

2821
02:31:49,600 --> 02:31:51,600
How did I jump all the way around her?

2822
02:31:51,799 --> 02:32:02,809
Good good. Good. Be careful though. I

2823
02:32:05,229 --> 02:32:12,200
Don't have enough 30 run. She's behind filler. Keep her there

2824
02:32:29,239 --> 02:32:36,629
Stop making funny references careful

2825
02:32:42,030 --> 02:32:48,889
You're probably gonna go up

2826
02:32:48,889 --> 02:32:53,500
staggered staggered

2827
02:32:53,500 --> 02:33:00,760
She could end this right now if she goes up. So just be very careful. Let's just play like a coward. Seriously

2828
02:33:01,280 --> 02:33:04,090
I

2829
02:33:05,010 --> 02:33:09,489
Know what I know she was gonna do it

2830
02:33:09,889 --> 02:33:11,889
There's some advice for you

2831
02:33:11,930 --> 02:33:17,489
Holy shit. You got him. You got him. All right. All right. All right. All right

2832
02:33:18,090 --> 02:33:32,030
We did it what? Oh

2833
02:33:32,309 --> 02:33:34,309
It's the second phase. Oh

2834
02:33:35,430 --> 02:33:39,520
No

2835
02:33:39,760 --> 02:33:44,760
What there's a cutscene how come how come how come oh

2836
02:33:46,360 --> 02:33:59,510
She's up

2837
02:33:59,510 --> 02:34:01,190
It's gonna happen

2838
02:34:01,190 --> 02:34:14,110
Yeah, she got me. It's fine. You can do this as long as she doesn't do I kill you

2839
02:34:14,670 --> 02:34:17,030
I've got fucking rot in two seconds, dude. I

2840
02:34:17,590 --> 02:34:28,979
Already have it there's over with rot too. No, no fucking way. This is literally fucking impossible in this room

2841
02:34:29,739 --> 02:34:43,799
Runs over runs over that pause. That's the only boss so far that has actually like regained health and gone to a phase two

2842
02:34:43,840 --> 02:34:45,760
Oh we can use

2843
02:34:45,760 --> 02:34:52,239
We can use spirit summons. No, you want to just like ding-a-ling-ling-ling and bring up

2844
02:34:52,959 --> 02:34:58,719
You will you will lose all respect from everyone who ever respected its randomizer. That doesn't matter

2845
02:35:00,799 --> 02:35:05,319
Dude, I'm telling you I think I think we ding-a-ling two teachers in here and we just fucking destroyer

2846
02:35:05,319 --> 02:35:11,159
I mean, that's your call if you want a ding-a-ling. I

2847
02:35:11,680 --> 02:35:20,760
Love how we spent so we spent the last two hours straight. I'm trying to get here

2848
02:35:21,159 --> 02:35:24,739
But we don't even have to do this this is optional

2849
02:35:25,219 --> 02:35:34,520
Yeah, we could probably do it. How much do you care go again? Okay?

2850
02:35:36,209 --> 02:35:38,770
We had we just weren't like mentally prepared for a phase two

2851
02:35:38,770 --> 02:35:44,450
We actually were not our mental crack the moment. She like teleported into the sky. It's very true

2852
02:35:44,930 --> 02:35:54,899
Phase one's easy as long as we like respect the you die

2853
02:35:55,700 --> 02:36:05,360
Millennia is a horseshit. You need you should just ding-a-ling this

2854
02:36:05,520 --> 02:36:16,500
You need you should just ding-a-ling this you should both use the boys so you get 20 people in the room that actually really funny

2855
02:36:24,420 --> 02:36:28,770
Fucking millennia, of course, you knew she was gonna show up at some point

2856
02:36:29,409 --> 02:36:31,799
It's just this is a really bad room for her to be in

2857
02:36:34,079 --> 02:36:38,040
Alright, what room would you have liked her to be in something that has?

2858
02:36:39,280 --> 02:36:41,159
a hundred percent more area to run around in

2859
02:36:41,680 --> 02:37:23,600
Alright, let's do it. Oh my god. I just fucking hate this piece of shit so much

2860
02:37:24,159 --> 02:37:28,489
I fucking hate this boss so much. I hate this place. I hate this boss

2861
02:37:28,809 --> 02:37:34,270
Okay, then your call like we can run away. We can come back later

2862
02:37:34,989 --> 02:37:36,989
We can get plus 50 swords

2863
02:37:37,149 --> 02:37:38,700
um

2864
02:37:38,700 --> 02:37:41,799
We're trying to like this. Let's go play truth or dare

2865
02:37:42,360 --> 02:37:47,799
All right, let's come on. I'm doing it like this. I feel like looking at it from a different perspective. It's a good idea

2866
02:37:50,909 --> 02:37:55,639
I'm gonna play upside down

2867
02:37:56,200 --> 02:37:58,760
Dog got me dog got me

2868
02:38:06,120 --> 02:38:16,250
God

2869
02:38:16,250 --> 02:38:19,290
All right, this is the last attempt and we're just going out splato

2870
02:38:20,110 --> 02:38:35,719
Okay, it's so close to hitting you

2871
02:38:39,100 --> 02:38:41,950
You're too slow

2872
02:38:41,950 --> 02:38:44,729
your host

2873
02:38:44,729 --> 02:38:46,729
I meant the guy who tried to scare me

2874
02:38:47,370 --> 02:38:58,059
I'm gonna save my dingulings for phase two

2875
02:38:58,780 --> 02:39:08,780
Smart. Oh, that's not good. She's coming for me. I'm dead

2876
02:39:11,979 --> 02:39:16,090
Like we're hitting their same amount and before she was staggering

2877
02:39:16,809 --> 02:39:21,450
So i'm kind of like expecting the stagger before she goes sicko mode and we're not getting it

2878
02:39:22,840 --> 02:39:24,840
I need you to there's no way I can do this alone

2879
02:39:25,399 --> 02:39:26,520
Although

2880
02:39:26,520 --> 02:39:31,399
Okay, kill it kill yourself. Hold on unless you feel the vibe literally. I need one more

2881
02:39:32,440 --> 02:39:33,559
Okay

2882
02:39:33,559 --> 02:39:35,559
I need one more. I need it

2883
02:39:35,799 --> 02:39:49,100
This is the last one no matter what as long as we're careful when she's at the the doomsday threshold

2884
02:39:49,979 --> 02:39:54,940
What am I sipping?

2885
02:39:54,940 --> 02:39:56,940
This is a green tea

2886
02:39:57,340 --> 02:40:00,829
Uh drink powder. I like it a lot

2887
02:40:01,389 --> 02:40:02,670
It's yummy

2888
02:40:02,670 --> 02:40:07,399
It's got a little bit of caffeine to give you a little bit. It's tasty

2889
02:40:07,959 --> 02:40:15,819
It's good

2890
02:40:15,819 --> 02:40:20,860
I read that. Um, the green tea the powder comes from like they grind up goblins

2891
02:40:24,760 --> 02:40:26,760
I'm gonna fucking die to this

2892
02:40:27,159 --> 02:40:31,840
I'm fucking gonna die

2893
02:40:33,440 --> 02:40:37,020
Goblins, uh

2894
02:40:39,239 --> 02:40:42,639
I don't think that's how it happened. I think it's

2895
02:40:43,440 --> 02:40:47,790
Hold on. What is it?

2896
02:40:47,790 --> 02:40:50,760
It's a tea leaf

2897
02:40:50,760 --> 02:40:53,920
They grind that up. Have you ever seen someone do it?

2898
02:40:54,879 --> 02:40:57,440
Yeah, actually

2899
02:40:57,440 --> 02:40:59,870
Like the actual leaf

2900
02:40:59,870 --> 02:41:01,870
I yes, i've seen it

2901
02:41:06,670 --> 02:41:10,670
Okay, first person to get first person to get hit by milania. What was the other person 20 bucks?

2902
02:41:11,149 --> 02:41:13,709
Why do you just keep like trying to financially ruin me?

2903
02:41:15,479 --> 02:41:16,920
I'm just saying

2904
02:41:16,920 --> 02:41:21,500
Well, that's gonna make you play like a little baby boy. We gotta get fucking in there

2905
02:41:22,379 --> 02:41:25,639
Get her

2906
02:41:26,120 --> 02:41:28,120
You owe me 20

2907
02:41:28,360 --> 02:41:32,809
I'm trying to lighten the mood man. The mood is light

2908
02:41:33,690 --> 02:41:35,129
Light her up

2909
02:41:35,129 --> 02:41:45,100
There's a lot of damage. I'm in the camera. I'm expecting it. Yep

2910
02:41:48,829 --> 02:41:50,350
She snuck around

2911
02:41:50,350 --> 02:41:53,549
It's okay. Sorry. She snuck around it

2912
02:41:53,709 --> 02:42:04,569
I don't go up again. I feel like she's going up again. I can I can see it in her eyes

2913
02:42:05,370 --> 02:42:10,030
You're just paranoid

2914
02:42:10,030 --> 02:42:13,549
Oh my god, you're making me scared and I don't think she's gonna do it again

2915
02:42:20,489 --> 02:42:23,290
Just do single hits right now like single jumps and back up

2916
02:42:25,420 --> 02:42:27,420
Until she shows her her true side

2917
02:42:28,219 --> 02:42:30,219
her fucking sicko mode

2918
02:42:30,379 --> 02:42:33,559
red-haired

2919
02:42:33,559 --> 02:42:36,040
Is she doing it? Nope. She's probably about to

2920
02:42:40,719 --> 02:42:42,719
Every time I jump in she jumps away

2921
02:42:43,760 --> 02:42:45,760
It's if it's happening. It's gonna happen very soon

2922
02:42:47,600 --> 02:42:49,600
Can't see what where'd she go?

2923
02:42:49,760 --> 02:42:52,750
This is between two pillars

2924
02:43:01,079 --> 02:43:03,079
Always keep a pillar between you and her

2925
02:43:08,860 --> 02:43:11,930
Here comes

2926
02:43:11,930 --> 02:43:14,489
I knew the moment I jumped on her that she was gonna do it

2927
02:43:14,729 --> 02:43:18,889
And I immediately started running and it was still too slow. Hey, let me cook for a minute

2928
02:43:19,770 --> 02:43:47,610
Okay, I thought it was I thought I could drink. I thought it was over. I thought the combo was over

2929
02:43:51,579 --> 02:43:53,520
my problem with milania is just

2930
02:43:53,520 --> 02:44:00,489
Knowing when you're just so scared of one of her moves that it's almost like a combo will happen and you'll go

2931
02:44:00,569 --> 02:44:05,049
Don't fucking do it. She's gonna do the water dance thing. Everyone is freak out and then it doesn't happen. But then it does

2932
02:44:15,370 --> 02:44:20,989
Undercooked learn to dodge that move. I know that this technically like a two frame window

2933
02:44:21,469 --> 02:44:23,469
to go like

2934
02:44:27,549 --> 02:44:32,030
I don't know it and it's gonna take a fucking a million years to figure to get that correct

2935
02:44:33,280 --> 02:44:36,159
You're supposed to dodge through it, but there's a window you can dodge through it

2936
02:44:36,239 --> 02:44:39,920
But if you want to dodge through it, you better have it right because you're gonna die if you miss even one frame

2937
02:44:40,639 --> 02:44:45,760
But chatter, how do we learn? How do we learn it? Do we do we fight the boss?

2938
02:44:47,040 --> 02:44:51,760
To learn that no, we have to go there's a training mode where you can just select any boss and oh

2939
02:44:52,319 --> 02:44:55,920
So we should close the game and open up the training mode. It's elden ring

2940
02:44:56,719 --> 02:44:58,399
training area

2941
02:44:58,399 --> 02:45:00,879
Okay, so we shouldn't fight the boss to learn it

2942
02:45:02,479 --> 02:45:05,959
Towershield is good. I think you can

2943
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:14,239
Inhale it pretty much right?

2944
02:45:14,239 --> 02:45:16,299
I think the

2945
02:45:16,299 --> 02:45:21,559
and people were saying the same thing when I played the game for real in fought millennia and it's

2946
02:45:22,510 --> 02:45:26,670
You can dodge through but the thing about dodging through it is you'll dodge through it and then you don't know where she is

2947
02:45:26,670 --> 02:45:28,510
She's behind you somewhere

2948
02:45:28,510 --> 02:45:34,750
And it's like you have like one second to really figure out exactly how to dodge through that second and third attack because she goes

2949
02:45:34,909 --> 02:45:36,670
Away from your screen

2950
02:45:36,670 --> 02:45:38,670
So it's tricky. It's hard

2951
02:45:39,770 --> 02:45:41,530
It's very tricky

2952
02:45:41,530 --> 02:45:54,110
What do you mean?

2953
02:45:54,110 --> 02:46:00,110
Oh, come on really

2954
02:46:00,110 --> 02:46:04,190
That was really early and I was really hoping we'd get the stagger. So I used all my stamina

2955
02:46:04,909 --> 02:46:07,280
You want me to put anything in the oven here?

2956
02:46:07,760 --> 02:46:09,979
All right, probably not

2957
02:46:09,979 --> 02:46:12,379
And that's too to it too too immediate

2958
02:46:14,920 --> 02:46:17,159
All right, like I don't even care if I lose so maybe that means i'll win

2959
02:46:22,479 --> 02:46:26,479
He has nothing left to lose. I don't even like give a shit like who cares if I just lose right now. Yeah, I don't care

2960
02:46:27,200 --> 02:46:38,399
Can you please do the neelix voice? I have the boss scrumptious cake captain captain

2961
02:46:38,799 --> 02:46:50,010
Do you think we could have some scrumptious cake? There you go. All right, three two one

2962
02:46:50,010 --> 02:46:57,770
Are we leaving the area one more? I have the strap

2963
02:46:59,680 --> 02:47:02,479
You have a new strap. What is it? I have the new strap. Let's go

2964
02:47:04,079 --> 02:47:08,239
Can you tell me what the new strategy is? You just keep doing what you're doing and stop doubting

2965
02:47:08,719 --> 02:47:12,799
All right, but what is your so fill me in on what the strategy is so I can make sure I know to do no

2966
02:47:13,600 --> 02:47:16,680
No

2967
02:47:16,680 --> 02:47:18,680
As long as you do your best

2968
02:47:19,680 --> 02:47:20,879
honey

2969
02:47:20,879 --> 02:47:22,879
We're gonna do just fine. Okay

2970
02:47:24,829 --> 02:47:28,440
No help

2971
02:47:28,440 --> 02:47:32,940
Just do your best. So you but you are approaching this differently is what you're saying a little bit

2972
02:47:34,219 --> 02:47:38,379
What but what okay if there's a point in like phase two and there's three hits left and you're like

2973
02:47:38,860 --> 02:47:43,340
You need to do this do this do this and you didn't tell me what it was. No, you just need to do your best

2974
02:47:44,159 --> 02:47:46,319
I need you to focus. I need you to think right now

2975
02:47:47,040 --> 02:47:49,040
If we lose right now, uh-huh

2976
02:47:49,600 --> 02:47:51,040
We have to do it again

2977
02:47:51,040 --> 02:47:55,600
I want you to be like no i'm gonna be cautious and safe and just kind of like hit her here and there jump in

2978
02:47:55,840 --> 02:47:57,840
Well, make sure she doesn't go up

2979
02:47:58,399 --> 02:48:03,040
I mean stir. I am stir. I've been you've you've been the one you've been the one dying

2980
02:48:03,600 --> 02:48:05,600
But I've had to wait around you

2981
02:48:06,159 --> 02:48:09,120
Wouldn't it be better if like oh she's been waterfowling at me

2982
02:48:09,200 --> 02:48:12,399
You're just gonna say i'm the one dying because she's attacking you're not hiding behind

2983
02:48:12,479 --> 02:48:15,040
You're not using the pillars. Are you fucking shit?

2984
02:48:20,360 --> 02:48:22,360
I really hope this strategy is gonna work out for us

2985
02:48:27,280 --> 02:48:30,540
Are you serious?

2986
02:48:30,540 --> 02:48:31,979
Okay

2987
02:48:31,979 --> 02:48:37,069
One more how about this i'm gonna beat her right now

2988
02:48:39,979 --> 02:48:41,979
But see but you're not wait

2989
02:48:42,620 --> 02:48:58,409
You're not

2990
02:48:58,409 --> 02:49:00,409
You're not even using my strategy

2991
02:49:25,290 --> 02:49:27,290
Too focused to remember the pillar

2992
02:49:27,290 --> 02:49:32,170
No, I just wasn't in the right spot. And even if I ran behind the pillar, she probably would have gone around it

2993
02:49:34,920 --> 02:49:37,239
All right, so this is one for real I just I did

2994
02:49:38,440 --> 02:49:40,440
We're gonna be stuck here for like four hours

2995
02:49:42,909 --> 02:49:45,629
Stir you realize that we have like good weapons

2996
02:49:46,270 --> 02:49:47,229
but I

2997
02:49:47,229 --> 02:49:49,229
We are like potentially

2998
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:51,360
like

2999
02:49:51,360 --> 02:49:54,719
Like 40 levels to like a 50 levels too low for her

3000
02:49:55,520 --> 02:49:57,479
You know that right?

3001
02:49:57,479 --> 02:49:58,360
Yes

3002
02:49:58,360 --> 02:50:04,920
So I I am aware that we shouldn't be insta dying the moment she touches us because we should just have like more health and stuff

3003
02:50:05,399 --> 02:50:07,399
It scales no should let us have this

3004
02:50:09,610 --> 02:50:11,610
It's scaled. It's scaled. No, no

3005
02:50:11,690 --> 02:50:14,409
Let us have this

3006
02:50:14,409 --> 02:50:19,290
How come the streamers can be fallible but the mod can't be and the scaling can't be a little off for milania

3007
02:50:20,250 --> 02:50:24,409
Copium overdose they messed up the code on milania. She's not scaled

3008
02:50:26,090 --> 02:50:32,250
Oh, I did hear about that. Yeah, and then it's in the patch notes. Yeah, it was like patch notes like uh, one point

3009
02:50:32,969 --> 02:50:35,290
uh, two point like uh three b

3010
02:50:36,250 --> 02:50:38,729
It was like having tons of trouble with with milania

3011
02:50:38,809 --> 02:50:43,930
It seems to be she's doubling her levels and the scaling doesn't work and she's doubling levels not scaling down

3012
02:50:44,329 --> 02:50:47,790
So it's like yeah. Yeah, I mean we're we're I mean if we beat this it's pretty good

3013
02:50:47,870 --> 02:50:49,870
And it's a little bit harder without the great run

3014
02:50:51,549 --> 02:50:54,829
Actually true though

3015
02:50:54,829 --> 02:50:59,069
That's the only thing that like the copium overload is like that's what you're saying is actually kind of true

3016
02:50:59,629 --> 02:51:08,920
This isn't a bad start. It's all right hold together

3017
02:51:15,610 --> 02:51:19,209
Don't you dare kill me? I will scream as loud as I can good. She's close

3018
02:51:21,770 --> 02:51:31,870
Keep your stamina

3019
02:51:31,870 --> 02:51:36,030
Nope. No, why did I why even attempt it? This opportunity is so small. All right. Yeah, be careful

3020
02:51:36,829 --> 02:51:47,100
It's coming

3021
02:51:47,100 --> 02:51:49,530
Keep a pillar between the two of you

3022
02:51:49,530 --> 02:51:55,479
I am here it is

3023
02:51:55,719 --> 02:52:01,159
Holy shit, are you fucking you're good? You're good. Hey, hey, you're fine. You're fine. It was only a little bit of hp taking off

3024
02:52:01,239 --> 02:52:03,239
You're fine. That was insane

3025
02:52:11,770 --> 02:52:29,229
Not a bad attempt if you could do it again, just be careful. Yeah, i'm i'm i'm envisioning it my game

3026
02:52:29,790 --> 02:52:31,930
a game like stuttered

3027
02:52:31,930 --> 02:52:33,930
I'm envisioning i'm envisioning

3028
02:52:34,170 --> 02:52:50,639
Please lock on to it. Okay. All right sicko mode. So just get out of the rot

3029
02:52:53,790 --> 02:52:57,389
Oh, it hit us both. It hit us both. Did it kill us both? It killed me

3030
02:52:58,030 --> 02:53:00,030
It scarlet rot at me. Oh

3031
02:53:08,510 --> 02:53:11,229
I was just wedged up against the fucking wall. I have no healing

3032
02:53:14,399 --> 02:53:17,770
Oh, that sucks

3033
02:53:17,770 --> 02:53:21,770
I thought we were in totally different spots, but then we kind of just ran together

3034
02:53:22,329 --> 02:53:26,250
Uh, it's weirder because like she would normally always go to the center of the room, right?

3035
02:53:27,280 --> 02:53:31,530
I know see the okay. Yeah, what happened there?

3036
02:53:31,530 --> 02:53:34,649
Because when she did it at first we were kind of confused and she went right in the middle

3037
02:53:34,969 --> 02:53:40,479
But she usually dives on top of you, right? I thought in the real fight. She always lands in the center

3038
02:53:41,200 --> 02:53:43,530
Wait, maybe i'm crazy. I think you are right

3039
02:53:46,440 --> 02:53:50,280
Doesn't it? Yeah, she lands in the middle. Why why did she jump on top of us? No, she dives you

3040
02:53:50,920 --> 02:53:54,059
Oh, yeah, she does

3041
02:53:54,059 --> 02:53:56,639
Okay

3042
02:53:56,639 --> 02:53:58,639
We are trying to get a pillar between her again

3043
02:53:59,899 --> 02:54:02,219
That's a good idea. I'm just trying to roll

3044
02:54:05,659 --> 02:54:09,500
You fucking hit ralphy. Well, I mean ralphy's completely in the way

3045
02:54:11,879 --> 02:54:22,670
Psycho

3046
02:54:22,670 --> 02:54:25,229
She dives on you but after the cutscene goes to the middle

3047
02:54:39,309 --> 02:54:40,829
All right, this let's

3048
02:54:40,829 --> 02:54:44,110
Actually last attempt because you know what's gonna happen. We're gonna we're gonna get to faith

3049
02:54:45,069 --> 02:54:50,079
We're gonna get to phase three

3050
02:54:50,079 --> 02:54:50,799
We're gonna get to faith

3051
02:54:50,799 --> 02:54:54,959
We're gonna get halfway through phase two and she has new moves in phase two that we're both gonna go

3052
02:54:55,360 --> 02:54:56,000
Oh, what is it?

3053
02:54:56,000 --> 02:55:01,440
What does that move and it's both gonna die to it and then we're gonna put our controllers in the air phase two

3054
02:55:02,159 --> 02:55:07,360
Easy. No, she does that weird ghost attack thing when she goes in the air and like 10 ghosts come out. Yeah

3055
02:55:08,319 --> 02:55:10,319
Yeah in here that's gonna be hell

3056
02:55:10,799 --> 02:55:13,280
But whatever well, it's all right. Those are excuses

3057
02:55:40,840 --> 02:55:43,079
Oh god, damn it. That's really unfortunate

3058
02:55:43,959 --> 02:55:53,209
Yeah, it is

3059
02:55:53,209 --> 02:55:55,209
I don't think we're gonna do it

3060
02:55:57,899 --> 02:55:59,899
Uh when I was first playing this boss

3061
02:56:00,750 --> 02:56:02,809
I remember thinking

3062
02:56:02,809 --> 02:56:06,729
I'm not gonna be able to do this and i'm gonna have to tell the stream that i'm just not doing it because I

3063
02:56:06,729 --> 02:56:09,770
Don't think I can I really didn't think it was possible for me to do it

3064
02:56:12,750 --> 02:56:17,229
I was trying to figure out like how am I gonna tell everybody that I can't do it and i'm like i'm just gonna give up

3065
02:56:19,309 --> 02:56:23,549
That was actually that was actually going through my mind for the last like two hours before I beat her

3066
02:56:25,370 --> 02:56:29,290
It's like, oh, how do I like say? Hey guys, like it's not fucking happening. It just isn't

3067
02:56:30,010 --> 02:56:57,069
third fucking time

3068
02:56:58,030 --> 02:57:02,270
Can stop doing this move stop doing this move, please

3069
02:57:06,430 --> 02:57:08,299
She wants it

3070
02:57:08,299 --> 02:57:10,299
It's the only move she has

3071
02:57:11,069 --> 02:57:35,639
All right

3072
02:57:35,639 --> 02:57:37,159
i'm just I

3073
02:57:37,159 --> 02:57:40,170
it

3074
02:57:40,170 --> 02:57:42,010
I hate this boss so much

3075
02:57:42,010 --> 02:57:47,450
Want to go fight bed of chaos?

3076
02:57:47,450 --> 02:57:53,600
I would rather like become roommates with the bed of chaos for five years

3077
02:57:54,000 --> 02:58:09,520
Then fight this piece of shit five more times. That one was really close though

3078
02:58:13,739 --> 02:58:19,340
This summon we could all right. This is the final attempt. This is the real last one. No more

3079
02:58:20,540 --> 02:58:22,700
No more fucking around before I before I like

3080
02:58:23,579 --> 02:58:29,399
Let's go somewhere else

3081
02:58:29,399 --> 02:58:34,680
We're going out to plateau right now. I'm just gonna teleport there without you. I'm just gonna go there without you. Okay. All right

3082
02:58:35,559 --> 02:58:37,799
Yeah, I I don't know. I have a lot of life

3083
02:58:37,879 --> 02:58:39,399
But every time she dives at me

3084
02:58:39,399 --> 02:58:45,559
I don't even have a chance to like dodge the second hit of uh, the waterfowl like it just fucking kills me

3085
02:58:46,520 --> 02:58:50,350
I don't know if because I have like no armor on or what my situation is

3086
02:58:50,829 --> 02:58:52,510
I'm just a dead boy

3087
02:58:52,510 --> 02:59:00,280
Like and i'm imagining a scenario where like the bed of chaos is like fucking dirty laundry is everywhere in the house and shit

3088
02:59:01,079 --> 02:59:03,159
And just like pots and pans go

3089
02:59:03,780 --> 02:59:06,680
Uncleaned after he cooks whatever fucked up shit that he cooks

3090
02:59:08,670 --> 02:59:15,639
Just constant issues really loud at like two three four o'clock in the morning. I don't even care. That's okay

3091
02:59:16,280 --> 02:59:33,610
I'm not fighting millennia again. Well, just decide where you want to go. Where do we we want to go to the okay?

3092
02:59:35,069 --> 02:59:37,559
if we go

3093
02:59:37,559 --> 02:59:38,600
Here

3094
02:59:38,600 --> 02:59:42,120
Right. No. No, we don't have to lift do we?

3095
02:59:51,209 --> 02:59:53,209
I'm fighting her right now. It's awful

3096
02:59:55,260 --> 02:59:57,709
one more time

3097
02:59:57,709 --> 02:59:59,709
No, no more times

3098
03:00:04,520 --> 03:00:08,600
No, there are no more times. All right, let's why am I always in combat here?

3099
03:00:09,799 --> 03:00:11,799
Where's the place to go to althus plateau?

3100
03:00:13,770 --> 03:00:15,370
We can come back. Uh

3101
03:00:15,370 --> 03:00:18,569
Well, what great rune bosses have we not done we were going to do ricard

3102
03:00:19,370 --> 03:00:24,920
Ricard is off the table as of right now. We did godfrey

3103
03:00:27,200 --> 03:00:28,940
then

3104
03:00:28,940 --> 03:00:31,790
I think we're done

3105
03:00:31,790 --> 03:00:33,790
Can we just like walk this way?

3106
03:00:33,790 --> 03:00:34,989
like here

3107
03:00:34,989 --> 03:00:39,850
Where that kind of burnt urn tree is that top where the bridge is can we we can get up there, right?

3108
03:00:39,850 --> 03:00:44,010
We can go to moag if we go to the uh, oh underground city

3109
03:00:44,569 --> 03:00:45,930
We could do underground

3110
03:00:45,930 --> 03:00:49,440
That sounds good to me. All right

3111
03:00:50,090 --> 03:00:53,360
Pull me back in let's go underground

3112
03:00:53,360 --> 03:00:55,360
Uh, what teleporter is that?

3113
03:00:56,329 --> 03:00:57,770
uh

3114
03:00:57,770 --> 03:01:00,409
We have a couple of them, but I don't know if that's the right ones we have to go

3115
03:01:01,370 --> 03:01:05,399
through

3116
03:01:05,399 --> 03:01:09,639
Yeah, I remember like the path to get down there when the ground is destroyed is really awkward. Yeah

3117
03:01:13,639 --> 03:01:15,639
underground sucks, you know

3118
03:01:17,760 --> 03:01:20,079
randomizer well

3119
03:01:20,079 --> 03:01:24,239
I'd rather go back to millennia when we have like a level 100 and I like all the stuff that we want

3120
03:01:24,799 --> 03:01:28,760
Not like it's gonna help

3121
03:01:28,760 --> 03:01:30,120
uh

3122
03:01:30,120 --> 03:01:32,120
I have opened my world to wanderers

3123
03:01:32,520 --> 03:01:40,219
Do we need to just go down to like the co for riverbank or there's a different way to get down to like actual

3124
03:01:40,940 --> 03:01:44,379
You have to go to the just come come to me come come to my world

3125
03:01:44,940 --> 03:01:54,329
sewer pipe

3126
03:01:54,329 --> 03:01:56,030
Yeah

3127
03:01:56,030 --> 03:02:14,489
Where all the omens are something like that. Okay, you guys are writing. All right following you

3128
03:02:26,940 --> 03:02:28,940
Why did it have to be millennia?

3129
03:02:30,379 --> 03:02:33,129
It could be any boss, you know

3130
03:02:33,129 --> 03:02:36,030
That one random room

3131
03:02:36,030 --> 03:02:38,030
Hey, it could be anything

3132
03:02:38,030 --> 03:02:40,030
So that means it could be millennia

3133
03:02:40,959 --> 03:02:46,479
I know but like I really wanted to see if like we have to use the spear on whoever replaces right card

3134
03:02:47,280 --> 03:02:49,280
I think we could do it eventually

3135
03:02:49,360 --> 03:02:50,959
We just gotta like

3136
03:02:50,959 --> 03:02:52,780
We just gotta go for it

3137
03:02:52,780 --> 03:03:03,100
It doesn't I don't know. It depends when she's looking at me, but it doesn't feel great to do on a caster

3138
03:03:04,989 --> 03:03:06,989
Yeah, that's also hard. It's a

3139
03:03:07,389 --> 03:03:09,389
slow

3140
03:03:09,389 --> 03:03:12,510
If one of us was like a dex user, I feel like that fight's easier

3141
03:03:13,229 --> 03:03:19,000
Everyone's gonna write omega lol dex in chat, but it's all right

3142
03:03:24,700 --> 03:03:26,700
Yeah, oh we had to jump down on the other side

3143
03:03:27,340 --> 03:03:33,549
I think I don't know this I remember like in my first playthrough just walking around this area for like an hour being like, huh?

3144
03:03:39,979 --> 03:03:41,979
Yeah, you gotta go like down

3145
03:03:42,379 --> 03:04:06,489
There are a couple things to do down here. I almost just didn't make that

3146
03:04:08,719 --> 03:04:11,049
with a double jump

3147
03:04:11,049 --> 03:04:17,469
I I spell

3148
03:04:17,469 --> 03:04:19,469
It's cool ancient city of wonder

3149
03:04:20,350 --> 03:04:22,350
What could lie millennia?

3150
03:04:24,600 --> 03:04:26,600
Is it possible for duplicates? It's not right

3151
03:04:27,319 --> 03:04:47,200
I don't think that's where millennia is that's where millennia will stay. Okay, that's all right then a little bit of a fall joke

3152
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:52,219
See my issue is i'm like rushing

3153
03:04:52,780 --> 03:04:54,940
I like I still feel like millennia is behind us

3154
03:04:55,899 --> 03:04:58,909
And i'm at the fucking volcano manor

3155
03:05:01,840 --> 03:05:05,120
Uh, I could probably just go grab the bonfire and vote

3156
03:05:08,840 --> 03:05:11,479
So I remember not getting a bonfire for a while down here

3157
03:05:13,159 --> 03:05:15,639
I can't really leave because I would port you out

3158
03:05:18,360 --> 03:05:19,639
Okay

3159
03:05:19,639 --> 03:05:22,840
Just chill for a second. Take a breather millennia is not behind you

3160
03:05:34,559 --> 03:05:41,290
Wait a minute. She's behind you

3161
03:05:41,290 --> 03:05:54,829
I don't know somebody is believe that somebody is behind me. You're just playing vr in your game

3162
03:05:55,870 --> 03:06:01,309
guys come come to my stream if you want to see his perspective like of just him in vr and like the actual inside the

3163
03:06:01,309 --> 03:06:05,709
Helmet view is um, I mean I I can banish you and you can just join me again

3164
03:06:06,590 --> 03:06:08,590
And then you'd be with me. That's probably easier

3165
03:06:12,760 --> 03:06:15,319
You know, I I like items down here. I can just I can just do it

3166
03:06:17,930 --> 03:06:19,930
You keep playing let's get up

3167
03:06:31,629 --> 03:06:35,069
Okay, i'm going to try to join you again

3168
03:06:40,649 --> 03:06:49,579
If I walked off

3169
03:06:49,579 --> 03:06:54,360
I got michaela's needle

3170
03:06:54,360 --> 03:06:57,879
Looks like I beat her

3171
03:06:57,879 --> 03:07:02,239
Cool. All right. So

3172
03:07:02,239 --> 03:07:04,959
What are the actual bosses that are down here? There's another one of those

3173
03:07:05,920 --> 03:07:11,360
the mimic spirits, right and the big no cron dragon man and

3174
03:07:13,159 --> 03:07:20,219
Mog if you get really far down is down here, right? I think we need a certain item or something for mog mog

3175
03:07:22,620 --> 03:07:26,280
Like yeah, I don't know if we can actually do

3176
03:07:27,799 --> 03:07:35,420
There is a mog like down here though. I'm just gonna walk out of this room

3177
03:07:37,770 --> 03:08:09,790
Okay, glen stone stars. Do you want it? No, there's like crucible knights down here. Usually

3178
03:08:12,540 --> 03:08:17,799
There are but it's randomized. So I doubt we'll see them. But yeah right down this hill is the mimic

3179
03:08:18,520 --> 03:08:27,629
Tear I don't know what boss would be in here. Uh, that's like the first enemies we've killed in like three hours

3180
03:08:31,290 --> 03:08:32,809
Uh, hey

3181
03:08:32,809 --> 03:08:35,770
millennia is always gonna just make a like

3182
03:08:36,649 --> 03:08:50,270
Six hour gap on any stream where somebody's playing it. This is the way it is. You're not gonna even get the item

3183
03:08:50,750 --> 03:08:52,319
I mean

3184
03:08:52,319 --> 03:08:56,239
It looks like a dumb lame item shattering crystal. Do you want it?

3185
03:08:57,120 --> 03:08:58,799
somber eight

3186
03:08:58,799 --> 03:09:00,799
And the mantis blade

3187
03:09:00,799 --> 03:09:04,120
I think the only spells I really want are like the beam ones

3188
03:09:04,600 --> 03:09:09,159
That's hurt a lot

3189
03:09:09,159 --> 03:09:13,639
Well, these guys are empowered by

3190
03:09:13,719 --> 03:09:14,600
Mog

3191
03:09:14,600 --> 03:09:21,840
What sort am I using? I'm using the magma worm sword

3192
03:09:24,639 --> 03:09:27,280
I'm using it's called the magma worms scale sword

3193
03:09:31,930 --> 03:09:33,930
All right

3194
03:09:35,129 --> 03:09:39,500
Runoc

3195
03:09:39,500 --> 03:09:42,700
I do wonder what we're gonna do about acquiring great runes

3196
03:09:46,190 --> 03:09:49,709
Didn't you say that there's a thing with this randomizer where oh

3197
03:09:50,270 --> 03:09:53,229
If you want to find this specific item you can or something

3198
03:09:53,549 --> 03:09:58,510
Yeah, there's like a cheat sheet notepad where you can look up where stuff is and I think also the merchants sell

3199
03:09:59,469 --> 03:10:03,209
Uh hints

3200
03:10:03,209 --> 03:10:05,209
You go. I'm scared

3201
03:10:05,370 --> 03:10:11,239
As long as it's not a dragon or millennia. It's just a misbegotten. We're good

3202
03:10:20,190 --> 03:10:22,190
It's a mimic misbegotten

3203
03:10:31,239 --> 03:10:41,579
Yikes

3204
03:10:41,579 --> 03:10:43,579
That's so much easier than millennia

3205
03:10:45,399 --> 03:10:47,290
Memory stone

3206
03:10:47,290 --> 03:10:52,219
I I am still I don't know what it is. I'm getting golden seeds from every boss. It's good

3207
03:10:52,860 --> 03:11:18,620
Do I have any not really I feel like it's time for a change of clothing. Oh, there's also the

3208
03:11:20,010 --> 03:11:21,920
The deer

3209
03:11:21,920 --> 03:11:24,000
Yes, if we light all of the thingies

3210
03:11:25,659 --> 03:11:28,860
Which uh, I know kind of a tired statement. I never did it

3211
03:11:29,659 --> 03:11:32,969
I did the first year and then I came down in this area and I was like

3212
03:11:33,610 --> 03:11:38,729
Getting shot by people who had bows you oh you didn't do this one. This one has I moved on with my life

3213
03:11:39,370 --> 03:11:50,510
The deer boss is really actually pretty cool

3214
03:11:52,200 --> 03:11:55,079
I enjoyed fighting the deer bosses. I think they were fun

3215
03:12:03,280 --> 03:12:05,680
Damn, that was a triple item drop

3216
03:12:07,979 --> 03:12:09,979
I didn't mean to do that. I thought it was an enemy

3217
03:12:10,379 --> 03:12:12,219
I was living jaw

3218
03:12:12,219 --> 03:12:34,670
Okay. So do you want to fight the um, yeah, whatever's here? Yeah light that flame

3219
03:12:36,040 --> 03:12:38,280
There is four twenty. I think there are six, right?

3220
03:12:40,159 --> 03:12:42,159
Oh 20 wait you

3221
03:12:42,719 --> 03:12:45,920
Are you hey you 420 you like 420?

3222
03:12:46,559 --> 03:12:52,040
No, i'm relating

3223
03:12:52,040 --> 03:12:54,799
420. All right

3224
03:12:54,799 --> 03:12:56,719
All right 420

3225
03:12:56,719 --> 03:12:58,719
Now just if you do

3226
03:12:59,260 --> 03:13:02,319
Recreational marijuana and it's legal in your state or wherever you are

3227
03:13:03,440 --> 03:13:08,000
Cool in moderation. Be careful. Don't do too much. It's not like just

3228
03:13:08,959 --> 03:13:14,409
Just treat it like anything else that you know, any more too much of a good thing too much of anything is bad

3229
03:13:20,319 --> 03:13:22,319
Shut up, dad. No, i'm serious

3230
03:13:22,719 --> 03:13:26,799
I'm serious be serious about it. They say even too many oreos

3231
03:13:28,700 --> 03:13:30,969
Yeah, it's true

3232
03:13:30,969 --> 03:13:32,969
Uh, you just have to touch them, right?

3233
03:13:33,770 --> 03:13:43,680
Yeah

3234
03:13:43,680 --> 03:13:46,620
That looks really weird

3235
03:13:46,700 --> 03:13:48,700
Elgin lord braces

3236
03:13:52,399 --> 03:13:56,239
Oh, wait, isn't there like a mini boss over here too inside this little area?

3237
03:13:58,360 --> 03:14:00,360
I think it's just an item

3238
03:14:01,549 --> 03:14:09,319
It's just an item but it's like we'll go get it jar. I think it's a it's a chest

3239
03:14:11,389 --> 03:14:13,069
If you go up all the way

3240
03:14:13,069 --> 03:14:14,270
Yeah

3241
03:14:14,270 --> 03:14:17,389
It is a chest but there is an opportunity for something cool to be in the chest

3242
03:14:18,110 --> 03:14:23,530
I really don't also an opportunity to like jump off this map. I don't want to be the one to do that

3243
03:14:23,530 --> 03:14:27,209
So i'm gonna be careful

3244
03:14:27,209 --> 03:14:34,440
I am the one that would do that

3245
03:14:34,440 --> 03:14:36,200
Watch out. It's being guarded

3246
03:14:36,200 --> 03:14:42,219
by the fucking gruesome slob

3247
03:14:43,579 --> 03:14:45,610
death root

3248
03:14:45,610 --> 03:14:47,610
You really are taking your time

3249
03:14:50,329 --> 03:14:51,930
My controller unplugged

3250
03:14:51,930 --> 03:14:55,530
It's control the vibe was off my controller unplugged

3251
03:14:56,620 --> 03:15:22,670
Look, can you not get out of here without teleporting?

3252
03:15:23,559 --> 03:15:31,040
You actually might not be able to get out of there. Yeah, I don't think you can

3253
03:15:32,809 --> 03:15:35,659
Do you want to just pour it?

3254
03:15:35,659 --> 03:15:37,659
Yeah, hold on. Let me turn this one on

3255
03:15:38,139 --> 03:15:45,100
I can do it too, right? Yeah

3256
03:15:49,840 --> 03:15:52,399
Uh, if you if you pour it, I will say yes

3257
03:15:53,200 --> 03:15:57,260
I already voted

3258
03:15:57,260 --> 03:15:59,260
You did i'm in common combat

3259
03:16:00,059 --> 03:16:06,139
I mean, hold this. Let me just get this one

3260
03:16:06,540 --> 03:16:22,219
Oh, no, you can get out. I'm good. Are you good?

3261
03:16:23,040 --> 03:16:23,840
Yeah

3262
03:16:23,840 --> 03:16:28,639
Oh, you did get out

3263
03:16:28,639 --> 03:16:31,440
We need what two more? I got one just now

3264
03:16:32,159 --> 03:16:33,959
I think there is

3265
03:16:33,959 --> 03:16:37,799
one or two more

3266
03:16:37,799 --> 03:16:40,760
Looks like anything happened to let you know, you got them all

3267
03:16:42,030 --> 03:16:44,989
I don't remember probably

3268
03:16:48,270 --> 03:16:50,909
I don't think so

3269
03:16:50,909 --> 03:16:52,909
We need let's see

3270
03:16:55,280 --> 03:16:57,280
We get this one. We got that one

3271
03:16:58,510 --> 03:17:00,030
I think we got them all

3272
03:17:00,030 --> 03:17:02,030
Unless there's one more somewhere

3273
03:17:02,350 --> 03:17:08,399
Did we get them all?

3274
03:17:08,399 --> 03:17:09,899
Oh god

3275
03:17:09,899 --> 03:17:11,579
That seriously killed me

3276
03:17:11,579 --> 03:17:14,219
There is one there's one more

3277
03:17:20,399 --> 03:17:22,159
one remains

3278
03:17:22,159 --> 03:17:31,370
What's my favorite pasta shape? Um, probably penne

3279
03:17:33,440 --> 03:17:34,719
or spaghetti

3280
03:17:34,719 --> 03:17:41,659
I'm getting where this last one is

3281
03:17:41,659 --> 03:17:50,719
I feel like it's deep

3282
03:17:50,719 --> 03:17:52,399
I got it. Yeah

3283
03:17:52,399 --> 03:17:55,280
It's a good thing I died. I never would have came back here

3284
03:17:55,760 --> 03:18:02,540
Our gathers. Oh, yeah. There we go. I have a debuff

3285
03:18:03,879 --> 03:18:06,120
Uh, do you want to just sit at the barn fire? No

3286
03:18:07,760 --> 03:18:09,760
We're doing this boss hard mode

3287
03:18:10,299 --> 03:18:12,299
We don't even know what it is. What if it's hard?

3288
03:18:12,959 --> 03:18:14,799
It's gonna be super easy boss

3289
03:18:14,799 --> 03:18:18,239
We've had like a really rough start to the stream just like last time where we decided to like

3290
03:18:19,040 --> 03:18:21,040
Run our heads into placid u6

3291
03:18:21,280 --> 03:18:24,030
And we ran our heads into malania

3292
03:18:24,409 --> 03:18:29,129
And jumping off a cliff, you know what I mean? Okay. Well give them a minute to uh vote

3293
03:18:29,770 --> 03:18:34,040
Never mind. Whoops. I goofed it. Oh no

3294
03:18:34,760 --> 03:18:40,750
I still don't have to go in. Yeah, let's see. Do you think we'll beat this first try?

3295
03:18:41,389 --> 03:18:45,360
Uh, this is gonna be the putrid clown

3296
03:18:47,340 --> 03:18:50,379
The putrid clown putrid clown juggler

3297
03:19:00,299 --> 03:19:02,459
All right. It looks like a lot of people think yes

3298
03:19:03,100 --> 03:19:08,879
A lot of people are saying yes

3299
03:19:08,879 --> 03:19:10,879
What they don't understand is behind this door

3300
03:19:11,600 --> 03:19:16,000
Is hold on if it if it's like rodon the stream is just gonna end it might probably enough

3301
03:19:16,559 --> 03:19:20,719
All right, let's go

3302
03:19:20,799 --> 03:19:22,969
Uh

3303
03:19:25,690 --> 03:19:29,079
No

3304
03:19:29,079 --> 03:19:30,120
well

3305
03:19:30,120 --> 03:19:35,799
There's a lot of mini bosses there. I gotta say for us to find like all of the end game bosses

3306
03:19:43,909 --> 03:19:46,329
Thankfully, it's in an area that makes sense

3307
03:19:47,129 --> 03:19:50,670
for this fight

3308
03:19:50,670 --> 03:19:52,750
Where are the beams? Don't they come down?

3309
03:19:53,629 --> 03:19:55,629
They should maybe they hit the ceiling

3310
03:20:05,069 --> 03:20:06,829
I forget this whole fight

3311
03:20:06,829 --> 03:20:07,790
Same

3312
03:20:07,790 --> 03:20:09,790
I haven't gotten next to it yet

3313
03:20:14,860 --> 03:20:16,620
Oh my goodness

3314
03:20:16,620 --> 03:20:22,809
Yeah, this first try easy

3315
03:20:22,809 --> 03:20:24,010
Hit it

3316
03:20:24,010 --> 03:20:30,719
And then it's gone

3317
03:20:30,719 --> 03:20:37,790
Eat shit

3318
03:20:37,790 --> 03:20:39,790
All that fucking hurts

3319
03:20:39,870 --> 03:20:51,149
Oh god

3320
03:20:51,149 --> 03:20:53,819
It's not going well

3321
03:20:53,819 --> 03:20:56,299
It's not going that badly either though

3322
03:20:57,260 --> 03:21:01,040
I don't have a lot of flash right now

3323
03:21:08,139 --> 03:21:15,819
I think it's just a game of patience

3324
03:21:15,819 --> 03:21:17,020
Where am I?

3325
03:21:17,020 --> 03:21:19,450
He's doing triangle mode

3326
03:21:19,850 --> 03:21:23,500
I think what is triangle mode? Oh, you have to jump over it, right?

3327
03:21:25,340 --> 03:21:28,139
Oh my god. Okay. Well I baby

3328
03:21:29,870 --> 03:21:32,829
I baby no, I said I maybe I don't know

3329
03:21:33,629 --> 03:21:37,149
I think we're okay, man. I think we're just we're thinking way too deeply here

3330
03:21:42,809 --> 03:21:45,209
It looked like he was swinging at you. Um, he is now

3331
03:21:49,340 --> 03:21:55,680
I have one flask remaining

3332
03:21:55,760 --> 03:22:00,399
I I so wish this was an arena where we could use a fucking horse. I didn't dodge that

3333
03:22:00,559 --> 03:22:02,559
But I did look like I did

3334
03:22:04,040 --> 03:22:06,040
He's just running

3335
03:22:26,719 --> 03:22:28,719
I think we're all right. Just play it safe

3336
03:22:46,860 --> 03:22:49,500
Oh this fucking move

3337
03:22:49,500 --> 03:22:51,500
It's it's on you

3338
03:22:51,959 --> 03:22:54,920
What the hell? Oh, that's this thing

3339
03:22:56,200 --> 03:22:59,159
Stop yelling. What is it making make it a youtube video or what?

3340
03:22:59,879 --> 03:23:04,680
It'd be a sick video if you were

3341
03:23:07,360 --> 03:23:09,360
Uh-oh, he's doing triangle mode

3342
03:23:09,899 --> 03:23:11,260
or circle

3343
03:23:11,260 --> 03:23:16,280
man

3344
03:23:16,280 --> 03:23:19,930
Get out

3345
03:23:19,930 --> 03:23:22,139
Okay, he nuked me

3346
03:23:22,139 --> 03:24:08,639
Stay alive

3347
03:24:08,639 --> 03:24:11,129
Wow believers

3348
03:24:11,129 --> 03:24:14,409
Hey, congratulations for the fucking millions of points. You probably just got

3349
03:24:18,200 --> 03:24:20,200
I got great rune of the unborn

3350
03:24:20,750 --> 03:24:25,770
I got a stone sword key and a bell bearing and the glint stone wet blade

3351
03:24:26,489 --> 03:24:30,110
And a bell bearing we sure i've got a few bell bearings. I don't know what's in them

3352
03:24:31,549 --> 03:24:38,059
We should go check

3353
03:24:42,520 --> 03:24:44,680
I'll be really honest though. We lucked out big time

3354
03:24:45,479 --> 03:24:47,530
because

3355
03:24:47,530 --> 03:24:50,729
If you put the elden beast in a room that's small like that millennia room

3356
03:24:50,889 --> 03:24:56,889
I don't think I we probably wouldn't to fight him in a small room. No, I don't think you know, you're not no

3357
03:24:57,690 --> 03:25:03,209
I would all those moves are so they're just aoe spam moves that we wouldn't you wouldn't be able to do it

3358
03:25:03,690 --> 03:25:08,729
Well, I would love to like for the experience to see what that fight's like if you're not constantly running across a football field

3359
03:25:12,250 --> 03:25:16,489
Like how are they gonna let him run that far and not give me a fucking sniper rifle in this game?

3360
03:25:16,889 --> 03:25:18,889
Yeah

3361
03:25:21,209 --> 03:25:37,930
So we did that

3362
03:25:37,930 --> 03:25:43,049
What else is down here? There's uh, then you drop down here and you go to uh, oh where the double gargoyles are

3363
03:25:43,129 --> 03:25:45,120
Yeah, we might get some

3364
03:25:45,120 --> 03:25:47,120
That's gonna be fun. Whatever. That is

3365
03:25:53,709 --> 03:25:57,790
Rip 15k imagine all the emotes with glasses I could have had with that much money

3366
03:26:01,389 --> 03:26:02,670
that's so

3367
03:26:02,670 --> 03:26:05,149
uh, that was

3368
03:26:05,149 --> 03:26:11,850
Emotes with the glasses I have no channel point shit like really at all. It's emos with glasses

3369
03:26:12,889 --> 03:26:14,889
I mean there aren't a lot of options

3370
03:26:15,450 --> 03:26:22,620
Some people have millions of points here and it's like, uh, it's like you 100 put glasses on the germamoon emote

3371
03:26:24,030 --> 03:26:35,479
Nice. There's a guy behind you

3372
03:26:35,719 --> 03:26:37,719
Oh watch out. It's you. Oh, it's you

3373
03:26:54,329 --> 03:27:00,409
Crab look at all those glasses

3374
03:27:03,020 --> 03:27:05,020
So many glasses emotes

3375
03:27:08,639 --> 03:27:10,639
What does the glint stone wet blade even let me do

3376
03:27:12,319 --> 03:27:17,040
I believe it lets you imbue weapons with the magic damage ash of war stuff

3377
03:27:18,479 --> 03:27:19,680
Oh, yeah

3378
03:27:19,680 --> 03:27:20,879
but it

3379
03:27:20,879 --> 03:27:23,049
So you can scale off of intelligence

3380
03:27:23,049 --> 03:27:24,809
With pretty much any weapon

3381
03:27:24,809 --> 03:27:28,250
I was I was thinking because I already do that but i'm using glint stone pebble to do it

3382
03:27:31,020 --> 03:27:33,739
There's another somber ancient stone. I've gotten a lot of

3383
03:27:34,540 --> 03:27:37,739
Bell bearings it really might be worth after we do this to go check what's there

3384
03:27:43,870 --> 03:27:45,870
Oh, there's a legendary over here

3385
03:27:47,020 --> 03:27:49,020
Legendary legendary legendary legendary

3386
03:27:54,319 --> 03:28:01,079
Lord of blobs bro

3387
03:28:01,079 --> 03:28:09,790
Where is it? Oh, I got mogs

3388
03:28:11,600 --> 03:28:19,469
Bro, I have the twin darmer set for this apparently

3389
03:28:27,930 --> 03:28:29,930
I got a I got a pose

3390
03:28:30,010 --> 03:28:43,739
Okay, nice. Who is that? Uh, that is the other that's the twin brother. Oh, this is bad

3391
03:28:44,760 --> 03:28:46,760
I don't think we need the spear

3392
03:28:46,760 --> 03:28:49,399
but but also we could be wrong and

3393
03:28:50,280 --> 03:28:54,000
Just die

3394
03:28:54,000 --> 03:28:58,079
Um, okay. There we go. We got the spear. We have the spear apparently

3395
03:28:58,639 --> 03:29:00,639
Where is it? I hate when this happens

3396
03:29:02,319 --> 03:29:05,920
Where is it? I hate when this happens. There it is coming slow. Don't panic

3397
03:29:07,530 --> 03:29:11,209
All right, we can I think we can do this the technique where he never attacks you

3398
03:29:11,850 --> 03:29:14,250
We don't have the oh you have to weapon art

3399
03:29:17,100 --> 03:29:20,059
If you can stun them, you can keep them stunned forever. I think wait

3400
03:29:20,700 --> 03:29:21,579
I

3401
03:29:21,579 --> 03:29:23,180
Am confused

3402
03:29:23,180 --> 03:29:25,819
What do you mean? How do you how do you do this shit again left trigger?

3403
03:29:27,319 --> 03:29:29,319
Yeah, mine doesn't have a wind blade

3404
03:29:30,350 --> 03:29:32,969
Only you can do it my chat saying

3405
03:29:37,399 --> 03:29:41,000
I saw so many speed runs this part that I know you can literally just keep them in like a loop

3406
03:29:41,079 --> 03:29:42,840
You really wanted to

3407
03:29:42,840 --> 03:29:44,840
Well, it's not worth it. I can't help

3408
03:29:44,840 --> 03:30:04,090
Does this thing cost mana or no?

3409
03:30:04,090 --> 03:30:06,090
Oh, they patched it. Okay

3410
03:30:06,250 --> 03:30:07,709
It's good to know

3411
03:30:07,709 --> 03:30:12,760
Oh, did they find like something that was fun?

3412
03:30:13,079 --> 03:30:16,600
And then they like patched it out. You need mana to do this shit. God damn it

3413
03:30:18,059 --> 03:30:19,260
I'm helping

3414
03:30:19,260 --> 03:30:30,479
I'm overweight with this

3415
03:30:30,479 --> 03:30:39,120
I wish I could see

3416
03:30:39,120 --> 03:30:55,500
I got him

3417
03:30:55,500 --> 03:30:57,500
Frater Raikhan

3418
03:30:58,860 --> 03:31:01,500
All you do is eat the gods and then you

3419
03:31:02,700 --> 03:31:08,969
I have no more mana

3420
03:31:08,969 --> 03:31:12,010
Uh, I guess I could just attack like this

3421
03:31:12,729 --> 03:31:16,639
Please don't die. It's only you

3422
03:31:16,719 --> 03:31:19,530
I'm not gonna who said I was gonna die

3423
03:31:20,459 --> 03:31:22,459
I'm just worried because I can't help

3424
03:31:23,180 --> 03:31:25,340
No phase two. No phase two. No phase two

3425
03:31:26,719 --> 03:31:28,719
No phase two. Don't do it

3426
03:31:36,190 --> 03:31:39,319
Yeah

3427
03:31:44,969 --> 03:31:47,290
These quotes are approximately correct

3428
03:31:48,250 --> 03:31:52,639
It's like you told an ai to do the the ryckhardt lines

3429
03:31:54,120 --> 03:32:08,379
Okay, good fight

3430
03:32:08,459 --> 03:32:12,520
I have to level up

3431
03:32:12,520 --> 03:32:15,719
Yeah, so so the next elden we're gonna do elden ring two

3432
03:32:16,520 --> 03:32:18,040
dark souls four

3433
03:32:18,040 --> 03:32:21,000
And uh, there's totally gonna be like a sword that shoots like wind

3434
03:32:21,879 --> 03:32:24,440
There's gonna be one boss

3435
03:32:24,440 --> 03:32:26,940
I have a question for you. Then there's gonna be a swamp

3436
03:32:27,659 --> 03:32:31,020
I I want I want the actual stir take because I don't know if this is just stupid or not

3437
03:32:31,020 --> 03:32:33,020
But I was thinking about this

3438
03:32:33,020 --> 03:32:35,450
Do you because eric look?

3439
03:32:35,450 --> 03:32:37,450
Everybody loves the from software

3440
03:32:38,549 --> 03:32:43,610
RPGs like this, right? We're not talking about any of the other games they've ever made not like armored core. Whatever this

3441
03:32:44,409 --> 03:32:48,010
Lower left of your screen that looks like this in like five of their games

3442
03:32:48,489 --> 03:32:54,809
Everybody loves these with the stamina bar and the you know dodging and the pairing they call they call them souls. So sure

3443
03:32:55,930 --> 03:32:58,489
Yeah, do you think it would be cool?

3444
03:32:59,610 --> 03:33:04,250
It they kind of just and look i'm not complaining. I love these games. They're amazing

3445
03:33:05,290 --> 03:33:10,569
But like each one of these games is like the same kind of game in a different setting with some slightly different changes, right?

3446
03:33:11,610 --> 03:33:13,899
Yeah

3447
03:33:13,899 --> 03:33:17,260
Would you pay like 15 bucks a month for a?

3448
03:33:17,739 --> 03:33:20,860
Souls like mmo where they just kept fucking adding stuff to it

3449
03:33:22,399 --> 03:33:24,399
They're making them anyway

3450
03:33:25,559 --> 03:33:28,170
god forged

3451
03:33:28,170 --> 03:33:34,649
But made by from software not like oh something in this world. No, I mean like the next whatever they do is just like, you know what?

3452
03:33:35,450 --> 03:33:40,170
We keep making this type of game and everybody loves it. So let's just like have one go forever

3453
03:33:42,350 --> 03:33:44,030
I mean, honestly

3454
03:33:44,030 --> 03:33:46,030
That's what neo feels like

3455
03:33:46,270 --> 03:33:50,590
It would just not with the emma like the actual online I would love the actual online

3456
03:33:51,799 --> 03:33:53,260
but

3457
03:33:53,260 --> 03:33:57,020
but comes with a big but that this would be being made by like

3458
03:33:57,879 --> 03:33:59,920
a japanese company

3459
03:33:59,920 --> 03:34:04,879
And it would have a whole bunch of like gacha mobile. Well mmo i'm using that term wrong

3460
03:34:05,200 --> 03:34:07,920
Not an mmo, but just like a like a constant

3461
03:34:08,719 --> 03:34:12,879
Like they make dark souls one dark souls two dark souls three they make bloodborne. They make elden ring

3462
03:34:13,200 --> 03:34:15,200
You're just saying live service dark souls

3463
03:34:15,520 --> 03:34:18,239
Yes, and it's just like that. It's just you don't have to worry about it

3464
03:34:18,239 --> 03:34:20,079
Oh, when's the next dlc like it's just gonna happen

3465
03:34:20,079 --> 03:34:22,879
It's gonna be like a wow patch like every like four or five like three or four months

3466
03:34:25,600 --> 03:34:32,190
I think on paper that sounds great. That's what I mean, but I think it would actually be fucking awful

3467
03:34:32,270 --> 03:34:34,430
Yeah in practice this it would be probably terrible

3468
03:34:34,510 --> 03:34:38,639
But I don't know. I just feel like I I I love these games

3469
03:34:38,879 --> 03:34:43,680
I feel like they wouldn't be able to execute that without completely killing the vibe of like hey for halloween

3470
03:34:43,680 --> 03:34:46,079
We got the new update to souls 14

3471
03:34:46,399 --> 03:34:52,319
That's right guys are gonna get like oh wear pumpkin hats and like there's like just like all the weird themed cosmetics

3472
03:34:52,399 --> 03:34:55,840
Everyone be running around. I didn't think of like fucking bizarro. Yeah

3473
03:34:57,520 --> 03:34:59,680
I didn't think of the it's christmas time

3474
03:34:59,920 --> 03:35:04,319
You dress up as a tree and transform using your talisman into a fucking present

3475
03:35:04,479 --> 03:35:13,069
I forgot about the the octoberfest update that would happen. Yeah. Yeah

3476
03:35:13,629 --> 03:35:15,049
Yeah

3477
03:35:15,049 --> 03:35:19,690
but I mean like in theory if that if like without the pessimism of it being bad because

3478
03:35:20,010 --> 03:35:22,969
I feel like there's a two percent chance. It makes it through like all of like

3479
03:35:24,170 --> 03:35:29,450
The business dealings for them to get like the money grant to be able to do some live service multi-year thing

3480
03:35:30,010 --> 03:35:33,530
Well, hold on get through all that and it's not many dlcs to dark souls 2 have

3481
03:35:34,170 --> 03:35:36,719
Well, it was a bunch wasn't it like four

3482
03:35:38,559 --> 03:35:40,569
uh

3483
03:35:40,569 --> 03:35:42,170
two three

3484
03:35:42,430 --> 03:35:46,989
Two or three. Yeah, so there were three dlcs for dark souls 2 and people always go. Oh man

3485
03:35:47,149 --> 03:35:51,870
It's awesome that isn't one of the things you say that one of the reasons why you like dark souls 2 so much more

3486
03:35:52,270 --> 03:35:54,190
Than the other ones is why?

3487
03:35:54,190 --> 03:35:58,030
How much content how much content there is why elden ring is pretty great

3488
03:35:58,430 --> 03:36:02,909
But isn't that kind of that that doesn't like I think you might get what you're saying

3489
03:36:03,549 --> 03:36:09,549
Within a couple years of like elden ring was like crazy financial successful raised a bunch of eyebrows

3490
03:36:10,030 --> 03:36:14,909
People are like, oh souls games people have been playing for like 10 years time to like come in and ruin it

3491
03:36:17,319 --> 03:36:23,479
Yeah, somebody made a good franchise long enough like we're getting dangerously close to like man. I miss the old from soft

3492
03:36:23,639 --> 03:36:28,840
I don't want it to happen. That's true. And I hate like if i'm jinxing it my bad, but like

3493
03:36:29,399 --> 03:36:33,239
These are the good we're in the good times and you gotta appreciate somebody said

3494
03:36:33,239 --> 03:36:37,479
It's actually kind of a good point is like art is finite

3495
03:36:37,639 --> 03:36:42,799
Should be kind of in this world and I think if you don't let a game like this be finite

3496
03:36:43,360 --> 03:36:49,120
Then you maybe are going down the road where it just ruins everything and where are we going?

3497
03:36:52,479 --> 03:36:58,440
How do we end up at the end of a ledge? How do we end up here? I don't get across somehow

3498
03:37:02,600 --> 03:37:07,799
I agree on that like everyone got to play through the same thing at the same time and get excited about the same stuff

3499
03:37:08,040 --> 03:37:08,920
Yeah

3500
03:37:08,920 --> 03:37:11,559
And at the moment that it does become like mmo

3501
03:37:11,799 --> 03:37:17,879
Everyone's like what's the quickest way to end game because I just want to like grind millennia for millennia's god-sent set

3502
03:37:18,590 --> 03:37:23,659
Yeah, that's true

3503
03:37:23,659 --> 03:37:25,000
Yeah

3504
03:37:25,000 --> 03:37:30,280
I think it's just like it's a it's such a good thing and it's such a it's such a unique experience that it's almost

3505
03:37:30,860 --> 03:37:35,639
You sit there and go god damn it. I wish I could have that unique experience again, but it's here

3506
03:37:35,719 --> 03:37:41,120
It already exists. You already had it. Fuck fuck dude

3507
03:37:41,360 --> 03:37:51,229
I'm just excited to see them explore like different settings again and see how armored core turns out

3508
03:37:55,950 --> 03:37:58,350
I never played any of the armored cores with any were they fun?

3509
03:37:58,989 --> 03:38:00,989
Well, what kind of I don't know what kind of games they are

3510
03:38:01,149 --> 03:38:05,709
I believe we had this conversation and yeah, I love like armored core one and two were amazing

3511
03:38:05,870 --> 03:38:07,870
I went to go get an item and I got

3512
03:38:08,719 --> 03:38:15,479
Annihilating fortunate. I'm awesome. I mean like I just thought like we're all doing it. Everyone's doing it

3513
03:38:16,299 --> 03:38:18,299
I'll just drop 60k souls real quick

3514
03:38:25,399 --> 03:38:32,139
Yeah armored core games are really good. I think they got like early on it was like slower more dark souls like slow big mechs

3515
03:38:32,540 --> 03:38:35,180
If you put on a whole bunch of armor your mech would like be slower

3516
03:38:35,659 --> 03:38:38,459
And it started to get towards like three four five

3517
03:38:38,620 --> 03:38:43,120
It got a lot more anime and I didn't really play those and i'm kind of hoping

3518
03:38:43,899 --> 03:38:47,870
And assuming it's going to be a little bit more like the older ones. Yeah

3519
03:38:51,079 --> 03:38:57,639
Uh, yeah, you uh because lightning coming from I did the mario thing

3520
03:38:57,719 --> 03:39:03,079
Where you jump like you freak out even though you make the jump you still jump a second time third time because you just don't

3521
03:39:03,239 --> 03:39:08,860
You thought you were gonna miss the edge. Is that three fall jokes today? Is it a little bit played out?

3522
03:39:08,860 --> 03:39:15,399
You think well, I mean you did miss that jump in the lava place like 40 or 50 times

3523
03:39:15,399 --> 03:39:29,739
So I think I can fall a few times. Ooh, whirl of flame

3524
03:39:45,049 --> 03:39:46,329
Okay

3525
03:39:46,329 --> 03:39:47,530
Okay

3526
03:39:47,530 --> 03:39:49,770
At like e3 comes around it's like june

3527
03:39:50,329 --> 03:39:55,209
And there's like a dark souls or like a bloodborne announcement like bloodborne moon rising

3528
03:39:55,930 --> 03:39:59,690
And like holy shit that like it's just like a cinematic trailer looks amazing

3529
03:39:59,770 --> 03:40:03,690
Looks so and at the end when it says like what consoles and everything it's on it's like, okay

3530
03:40:03,690 --> 03:40:09,770
This was made by nexon. How are you feeling after that?

3531
03:40:10,329 --> 03:40:17,610
I don't know about that

3532
03:40:17,610 --> 03:40:21,370
Well, I think I think that goes back to what you were asking. Yeah

3533
03:40:23,790 --> 03:40:28,780
I think

3534
03:40:31,360 --> 03:40:33,360
Yeah, I don't know about that

3535
03:40:42,299 --> 03:40:45,979
What if I told you that this game was ass and there's nothing you could do to convince me. Otherwise

3536
03:40:46,700 --> 03:40:51,340
I would tip my hat to you and say good day. Good, sir. We have different opinions. Um,

3537
03:40:51,979 --> 03:40:53,819
Enjoy the rest of your evening

3538
03:40:53,819 --> 03:40:57,280
I got the magma whip candlestick

3539
03:41:02,010 --> 03:41:04,159
I think uh

3540
03:41:04,159 --> 03:41:08,719
When someone says you can't change my mind about this. Yeah, that's like that. Oh that i'm not going

3541
03:41:08,959 --> 03:41:10,479
I'm not gonna try

3542
03:41:10,479 --> 03:41:14,879
You really expect me to do anything else other than not talk to you anymore. Yeah, it's like hold on a minute here

3543
03:41:15,520 --> 03:41:17,520
Listen to me. Let's talk about this

3544
03:41:18,159 --> 03:41:21,840
You've already you've already given me no opportunity to uh to give you an argument

3545
03:41:25,739 --> 03:41:27,739
I would just say yeah. All right

3546
03:41:29,370 --> 03:41:32,059
I have have a good day

3547
03:41:36,719 --> 03:41:37,920
It's like hey

3548
03:41:37,920 --> 03:41:39,520
Hey jeremy

3549
03:41:39,520 --> 03:41:42,079
Pizza is disgusting. I think it's fucking gross

3550
03:41:42,719 --> 03:41:45,440
What do you say about that? Do you think you think you're gonna convince me to eat pizza?

3551
03:41:46,489 --> 03:41:48,489
No, that's more pizza for me

3552
03:41:48,729 --> 03:41:54,010
Can't convince you though something you already don't want or don't like

3553
03:41:54,829 --> 03:41:57,229
You already um, you've already made up your mind

3554
03:41:57,950 --> 03:41:59,950
And it's almost like you want me

3555
03:42:00,030 --> 03:42:04,670
To argue with you so you can argue your points back to me

3556
03:42:05,469 --> 03:42:10,829
But why you think i'm wrong you're trying this is a your wrong scenario and I want to prove why

3557
03:42:12,299 --> 03:42:13,500
Sorry

3558
03:42:13,500 --> 03:42:15,500
I'm not gonna give that opportunity to you

3559
03:42:16,540 --> 03:42:21,500
We can go over to the tree that's over there because there's usually a crucible knight and item or we just go up to uh

3560
03:42:22,379 --> 03:42:25,420
giant dead mermaid

3561
03:42:25,420 --> 03:42:29,520
You make the call mermaid

3562
03:42:35,399 --> 03:42:38,680
Which I this is not how you get there. I I don't think it is

3563
03:42:41,680 --> 03:42:46,079
I know this is a really really stupid question to ask but you definitely didn't do like the secret boss

3564
03:42:46,079 --> 03:42:48,079
That's up here when you fight. Um

3565
03:42:48,399 --> 03:42:50,959
the deathbed companion all of her champions

3566
03:42:52,219 --> 03:42:56,459
No, I did that you did that's actually surprising. That's not really a secret

3567
03:42:56,540 --> 03:42:59,500
I mean that's like you have to do a very specific amount bunch of shit in a row to do that

3568
03:43:00,139 --> 03:43:03,420
I don't think so. You don't I don't have to do her whole quest line

3569
03:43:03,899 --> 03:43:05,899
Um, I thought you just show up

3570
03:43:06,139 --> 03:43:08,139
Oh, I thought you had to do her whole quest line

3571
03:43:08,969 --> 03:43:10,969
Coke zero or diet coke neither

3572
03:43:11,370 --> 03:43:21,239
I don't like either one of them

3573
03:43:21,239 --> 03:43:24,520
Just give me a smaller regular coke so I can so all right

3574
03:43:25,159 --> 03:43:27,159
I would rather drink less

3575
03:43:27,639 --> 03:43:30,840
Regular coke than more coke that doesn't taste that good

3576
03:43:33,079 --> 03:43:37,559
Just I want to drink less of the if sugar and all that and calories or whatever is what you're concerned about

3577
03:43:37,879 --> 03:43:41,479
I would just I would just I don't I don't want to drink like a full 12 ounce can

3578
03:43:42,729 --> 03:43:45,680
If you get a two liter just have a little bit

3579
03:43:45,680 --> 03:43:50,760
I'd rather have the full flavored one but less of it. I really don't like I know a lot of people

3580
03:43:51,159 --> 03:43:53,159
Love the way the diet coke tastes

3581
03:43:54,030 --> 03:43:59,709
It tastes like flavored air in your mouth after and people go. Yeah, that's the point. That's why I like it

3582
03:44:00,270 --> 03:44:02,430
It's like okay

3583
03:44:02,430 --> 03:44:06,430
And i'm telling you right now you are not going to convince me otherwise that diet coke is good

3584
03:44:09,120 --> 03:44:13,420
Go on. Come on

3585
03:44:13,420 --> 03:44:15,180
I mean, I I don't

3586
03:44:15,180 --> 03:44:20,379
I don't have a stake in this

3587
03:44:20,379 --> 03:44:23,370
Uh, where did you where are you? Did you go up?

3588
03:44:24,090 --> 03:44:25,370
I went up

3589
03:44:25,370 --> 03:44:26,649
It's moag

3590
03:44:26,649 --> 03:44:29,790
Did you just seriously spoil my?

3591
03:44:30,270 --> 03:44:32,270
It's fucking boss here

3592
03:44:32,430 --> 03:44:38,840
I mean you're talking about drinking air. I

3593
03:44:40,299 --> 03:44:45,239
Wandering around it's because coke diet coke when you take a sip out of it

3594
03:44:45,639 --> 03:44:47,879
It kind of disappears in your mouth and leaves this

3595
03:44:48,600 --> 03:44:52,520
It leaves this weird like air flavored flavored like sugar air

3596
03:44:53,930 --> 03:44:56,170
You don't know what i'm saying people the people that get it get it

3597
03:44:58,059 --> 03:45:02,219
Magicians actually use it when you take a sip of diet coke. It goes like

3598
03:45:03,440 --> 03:45:05,440
And it's this and it's this weird like

3599
03:45:06,399 --> 03:45:09,520
Like someone breathing in your mouth. I'm telling you it's

3600
03:45:11,739 --> 03:45:14,620
Why do I have so I just got so many

3601
03:45:14,620 --> 03:45:17,340
Shit keeps falling off the trees. I just yeah, what the fuck?

3602
03:45:17,659 --> 03:45:21,260
That's got like 15 000 souls. Wait, did I I didn't just activate that right?

3603
03:45:26,239 --> 03:45:32,399
Aftertaste it's but it's an yes. It is an aftertaste, but it's like an airy aftertaste. That's what i'm saying, dude

3604
03:45:33,200 --> 03:45:36,959
Hold on a second. I'm getting another I just got another 10 000. Yeah same

3605
03:45:38,250 --> 03:45:39,610
Let's hold on

3606
03:45:39,610 --> 03:45:59,120
Respawn everything. Yep. Cool. That's got another 11k

3607
03:45:59,920 --> 03:46:07,799
All right. Let me level up one more time. The last time I got this much shit for free. It was on game pass

3608
03:46:10,840 --> 03:46:12,200
Yeah, I mean it

3609
03:46:12,200 --> 03:46:13,639
I could believe that

3610
03:46:13,719 --> 03:46:19,719
Considering that in the last like two weeks load monster hunter rise came out on game pass. You can just download it

3611
03:46:20,860 --> 03:46:22,520
On top of that

3612
03:46:22,520 --> 03:46:27,959
Hi-fi rush comes out. It's on game pass. Just you can just get it golden eye remaster. It's on game pass

3613
03:46:28,700 --> 03:46:30,700
It's like a hundred fucking dollar value

3614
03:46:31,020 --> 03:46:33,260
You've got to be kidding me like just actually kidding me

3615
03:46:34,680 --> 03:46:44,670
It actually is mog. You're right

3616
03:46:46,649 --> 03:46:48,809
Um, so do you want to fight him solo?

3617
03:46:50,600 --> 03:46:52,280
You want to fight him solo?

3618
03:46:52,280 --> 03:46:55,479
Well, no you because he's like your favorite and you're you're like wearing his outfit

3619
03:46:56,120 --> 03:46:59,399
You like are showing up to the boss in his clothes like look. I got it, too

3620
03:46:59,479 --> 03:47:01,479
I'm showing up to like comic con

3621
03:47:02,329 --> 03:47:04,329
This is the i'm in the meet and greet line

3622
03:47:15,149 --> 03:47:17,149
That's my move

3623
03:47:21,959 --> 03:47:23,959
Is he gonna like count down and

3624
03:47:24,459 --> 03:47:26,459
He's probably gonna do the thing

3625
03:47:26,459 --> 03:47:33,739
Sorry, just be aware of it

3626
03:47:33,739 --> 03:47:37,420
I forget how that works and if we need an item for him to not

3627
03:47:38,059 --> 03:47:41,020
Murder us. It's a flask item, but you can heal through it

3628
03:48:12,110 --> 03:48:13,149
Oh

3629
03:48:13,149 --> 03:48:18,250
You got me with a backswing. I'm doing a challenge run where I have to get hit by every attack

3630
03:48:19,610 --> 03:48:21,770
I was gonna say I've heard you scream like a lot

3631
03:48:36,360 --> 03:48:40,909
Fucking die

3632
03:48:40,909 --> 03:48:43,069
Oh, that was quicker than I thought it was gonna be

3633
03:48:59,959 --> 03:49:04,780
He's gonna do his thing and we need to heal through it. I got one flash

3634
03:49:05,500 --> 03:49:07,739
Maybe he doesn't do it because

3635
03:49:07,739 --> 03:49:09,739
He should have he should be doing it now

3636
03:49:10,159 --> 03:49:16,559
Wait, this might be the other mug the fake mug. Yeah, it's the fake mug a different mug like no

3637
03:49:16,559 --> 03:49:18,559
I know actually doesn't he have a different name?

3638
03:49:19,440 --> 03:49:24,879
Other than bog, I think it's omen. I thought he had a name like underbelly submissive boy

3639
03:49:26,090 --> 03:49:27,129
Uh

3640
03:49:27,129 --> 03:49:29,129
I don't um

3641
03:49:29,209 --> 03:49:31,530
Just beat the boss already

3642
03:49:31,530 --> 03:49:38,360
Hey, remember when you made that joke about me fighting the boss alone

3643
03:49:39,159 --> 03:49:40,040
Yeah

3644
03:49:40,040 --> 03:49:43,959
Hey, i'm fucking doing a lot. You just don't know

3645
03:49:57,239 --> 03:49:59,680
Oh, you're so cool

3646
03:49:59,680 --> 03:50:04,350
I'm such a huge fan, by the way

3647
03:50:04,670 --> 03:50:06,959
lord's aid

3648
03:50:06,959 --> 03:50:12,719
You know what? I I was gonna respect to like the faith support character. I'm I feel like i'm playing so bad. I really just should

3649
03:50:15,420 --> 03:50:17,290
What's your drip?

3650
03:50:17,290 --> 03:50:21,129
This is what you needed all the question for afterwards. You talked to her to do plastic do six

3651
03:50:22,170 --> 03:50:24,250
But the initial fight I think is uh always here

3652
03:50:25,500 --> 03:50:26,379
um

3653
03:50:26,379 --> 03:50:32,459
What do we say? That's right

3654
03:50:35,879 --> 03:50:38,040
To be a mother so it is I must bear

3655
03:50:40,360 --> 03:50:42,940
Bottom one

3656
03:50:42,940 --> 03:50:44,940
Oh, I think I just ruined it

3657
03:50:45,959 --> 03:50:47,959
Because we uh, i'm disbanding

3658
03:50:49,389 --> 03:50:50,270
Oh

3659
03:50:50,270 --> 03:50:57,129
I want to spend uh

3660
03:50:57,129 --> 03:50:59,209
Quick amount of time. I am gonna do the respect

3661
03:51:04,139 --> 03:51:08,350
Am I okay?

3662
03:51:08,350 --> 03:51:13,549
I can still choose. Okay. Good. Wait, you you let her hold you. No, that's you're supposed to so then that's how you fight

3663
03:51:13,549 --> 03:51:19,069
Plastic do you think you sick fuck? That's how you fight plastic do six you fucking horn dog

3664
03:51:23,399 --> 03:51:31,020
Uh, I could just go back there deathbed companion

3665
03:51:32,729 --> 03:51:36,319
Loathsome dung eater

3666
03:51:36,319 --> 03:51:41,850
Horoloo chieftain of the badlands and who could forget

3667
03:51:53,479 --> 03:51:56,840
The all-knowing

3668
03:51:56,840 --> 03:52:08,489
It puts me in combat every time. I can't leave this area. It's annoying. Can I take one of these things to like go back?

3669
03:52:09,290 --> 03:52:15,159
That's not good

3670
03:52:15,159 --> 03:52:16,200
even

3671
03:52:16,200 --> 03:52:27,579
How do I get out of here?

3672
03:52:27,579 --> 03:52:33,549
I can't

3673
03:52:33,549 --> 03:52:37,950
I don't want to run through all this. I know I just whatever but what if I miss i'm gonna

3674
03:52:38,750 --> 03:52:45,719
I'm okay. I can make it

3675
03:52:46,399 --> 03:52:51,469
Why am I alive?

3676
03:52:51,469 --> 03:52:55,469
I don't know, but doesn't kill you instantly. How come it was killing us instantly?

3677
03:52:56,190 --> 03:53:11,440
What the fuck? Wait, what the that was weird?

3678
03:53:17,000 --> 03:53:20,520
Like we already did this. My brown hole is invaded again

3679
03:53:21,399 --> 03:53:23,399
It might just keep doing that

3680
03:53:23,959 --> 03:53:25,319
maybe

3681
03:53:25,319 --> 03:53:27,319
They died in three hits this time

3682
03:53:27,770 --> 03:53:29,770
Wow a hundred souls, thanks

3683
03:53:30,940 --> 03:53:33,479
Oh, yeah, check your bells

3684
03:53:33,479 --> 03:53:38,600
Bells your bell bearings. Oh good idea. I want to just teleport out of here

3685
03:53:45,399 --> 03:53:47,790
Did I go the wrong way?

3686
03:53:47,790 --> 03:53:51,149
I mean, i'm just trying to get far enough away from where I was to teleport

3687
03:53:52,110 --> 03:53:56,030
Golden order seal boost fundamentalist incantations. Do you remember what those are?

3688
03:53:58,319 --> 03:54:00,719
What counts as fundamentalist? I think

3689
03:54:01,680 --> 03:54:04,719
some of the big fire spells count

3690
03:54:07,600 --> 03:54:17,690
Is the the black flame stuff I think the holy light one. Oh, it's lightning. Okay. Do you have any seals?

3691
03:54:17,690 --> 03:54:20,569
I only have a golden order and dragon communion

3692
03:54:21,290 --> 03:54:22,889
I

3693
03:54:22,889 --> 03:54:24,889
Do have some seals

3694
03:54:24,889 --> 03:54:31,610
I have dragon communion and I gave you the other one. Whatever it was. Yeah, that's the golden order

3695
03:54:32,010 --> 03:54:40,090
I guess i'll use that one

3696
03:54:40,090 --> 03:54:48,940
Okay, just really get the hell out of here. It's not open in my goddamn game

3697
03:54:49,739 --> 03:55:07,899
What do I do now?

3698
03:55:07,899 --> 03:55:10,139
You went the wrong way rest go down the ladder

3699
03:55:15,389 --> 03:55:17,389
I just want to pull the fuck out of here

3700
03:55:18,860 --> 03:55:19,819
uh

3701
03:55:19,819 --> 03:55:22,190
Go into the castle

3702
03:55:22,190 --> 03:55:25,469
Read chat i'm staring at you right now. It's just read

3703
03:55:26,190 --> 03:55:31,709
Chat read chat is is there are there are 5 000 messages, which one?

3704
03:55:33,020 --> 03:55:33,979
read

3705
03:55:33,979 --> 03:55:35,979
Chat i'm just gonna go this way

3706
03:55:36,940 --> 03:55:52,170
I'm gonna die in

3707
03:55:52,170 --> 03:55:55,209
I'm just running around in circles until I figure out where the hell i'm supposed to go

3708
03:55:58,969 --> 03:56:01,129
That's a bunch of garbage my bell bearings are all

3709
03:56:04,399 --> 03:56:05,920
Ball lakes

3710
03:56:05,920 --> 03:56:10,559
I think I can go through here

3711
03:56:10,559 --> 03:56:21,129
Can I go through here?

3712
03:56:21,129 --> 03:56:23,850
What are you doing right now? How does he not remember doing this multiple times?

3713
03:56:24,250 --> 03:56:28,329
Um, because this area is fucking enormous and there's so many random ass places to go

3714
03:56:28,969 --> 03:56:32,569
That and they all look pretty identical. So they're all the same place in my brain

3715
03:56:34,879 --> 03:56:37,440
Where are you trying to go? I'm just trying to get to any grace

3716
03:56:38,159 --> 03:56:40,159
But I can't go anywhere

3717
03:56:40,479 --> 03:56:44,879
Oh, you're trying to get a closer you're trying to millennia right now. I'm trying to get the hell out of this area

3718
03:56:45,680 --> 03:56:48,959
But it won't let me

3719
03:56:48,959 --> 03:56:53,040
Uh, then inside the building to the left and you go down the stairs. That's where I was thinking of going

3720
03:56:53,040 --> 03:56:55,040
But there's somebody scary there

3721
03:56:55,040 --> 03:56:57,440
Uh, that's fine. That's where we were spawning earlier with the bird in the way

3722
03:56:59,229 --> 03:57:01,870
That's what I just didn't want to get blocked by that

3723
03:57:06,649 --> 03:57:08,889
and then down the stairs here, right

3724
03:57:10,809 --> 03:57:16,409
My uh finger reader receive equipment of champions she's got ash of war kick

3725
03:57:17,959 --> 03:57:24,909
Wow, this guy's just gonna fuck it all up for me. I know it's gonna chase me

3726
03:57:40,190 --> 03:57:43,450
Okay kick is op

3727
03:57:50,840 --> 03:57:53,159
Is kick I mean kick is actually pretty good

3728
03:57:57,879 --> 03:57:59,819
Yeah

3729
03:57:59,819 --> 03:58:03,930
Is it?

3730
03:58:03,930 --> 03:58:06,409
Bro, am I even going the right direction?

3731
03:58:08,780 --> 03:58:15,129
Yep, that bird wasn't even there before when was that bird here?

3732
03:58:16,239 --> 03:58:19,370
Lightning isn't faith scaling. Yes, it is

3733
03:58:32,559 --> 03:58:35,680
Wait non lightning is dex

3734
03:58:36,959 --> 03:58:38,219
Yeah

3735
03:58:38,219 --> 03:58:40,219
I got lightning ram and it's dex

3736
03:58:42,510 --> 03:58:46,350
I don't have the only thing i've been missing is I don't have a single faith ash of war

3737
03:58:47,069 --> 03:58:50,200
I wish I could drop them because I think I have two or three of them

3738
03:58:52,809 --> 03:58:55,629
I don't think I have the uh

3739
03:58:55,629 --> 03:58:57,629
The thing to make them faith

3740
03:58:59,420 --> 03:59:01,659
Oh the actual doors are open now

3741
03:59:14,700 --> 03:59:16,700
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

3742
03:59:16,700 --> 03:59:20,299
The dragon communion seal scales on arcane, right?

3743
03:59:21,850 --> 03:59:24,270
I could do that

3744
03:59:24,270 --> 03:59:26,590
Wait, I could put it on a weapon and drop it really

3745
03:59:30,809 --> 03:59:32,809
That's kind of cool. I didn't know that

3746
03:59:34,879 --> 03:59:35,920
Okay

3747
03:59:35,920 --> 03:59:37,280
Let me see

3748
03:59:37,280 --> 03:59:45,469
I have um sacred blade

3749
03:59:46,200 --> 03:59:48,360
And I think I can put it on a weapon and just give it to you

3750
03:59:48,840 --> 03:59:57,600
That's actually a good idea if I gave you my long sword. Yeah, and I could just put it on and just give it back

3751
03:59:59,950 --> 04:00:05,329
I'm thinking uh, because I have actually a whole bunch of stuff that scales with a cult. I could use the dragon communion

3752
04:00:07,309 --> 04:00:09,770
um

3753
04:00:09,770 --> 04:00:11,770
But does that scale just as good as the other?

3754
04:00:13,600 --> 04:00:15,450
um

3755
04:00:15,450 --> 04:00:17,340
seals

3756
04:00:17,340 --> 04:00:18,700
I think

3757
04:00:18,700 --> 04:00:20,700
the dragon seal scales

3758
04:00:21,100 --> 04:00:22,780
He said with arcane

3759
04:00:22,780 --> 04:00:29,340
But it also just can be used as a seal for every other spell. I think it just depends on what the spell is

3760
04:00:29,819 --> 04:00:33,790
Yeah, I just want to make sure i'm not like screwing myself in some obscure way

3761
04:00:34,270 --> 04:00:38,829
I don't i'm gonna i'm gonna do arcane. I should have another larval tier i'm just gonna go arcane

3762
04:00:39,149 --> 04:00:42,989
Which is also good because that's a magic vine for items and it's all random

3763
04:00:43,069 --> 04:00:47,469
So maybe we get more better stuff dragon communion scales to s with arcane at level 10

3764
04:00:47,709 --> 04:00:55,280
Apparently, is there any other fun stuff that I want to use? Maybe i'll be like a

3765
04:00:56,000 --> 04:00:59,440
Maybe i'll do the bubble thing. That's kind of fun. Then that's the play

3766
04:00:59,920 --> 04:01:09,920
Do you guys want me to level up? Uh the big bubble horn? Uh, do you have a smithing stone?

3767
04:01:10,559 --> 04:01:12,219
somber five

3768
04:01:12,219 --> 04:01:19,819
I probably do let's see what i'm missing. I have a somber stone five

3769
04:01:23,530 --> 04:01:26,170
Do you have a nine is there a nine or does it go straight to dragon?

3770
04:01:26,250 --> 04:01:30,489
There is a nine and I also have a nine as well. Okay, I need a five and a nine

3771
04:01:31,340 --> 04:01:34,840
I can give you both of those. Okay, then i'm gonna go

3772
04:01:36,760 --> 04:01:54,540
Respec again, I guess oh the bearings. Yeah, I do check your bearing shop if you haven't yeah, I did

3773
04:01:54,700 --> 04:02:02,059
When does she go sit? Oh, you have to get her. Yeah, her shop will be randomized too. Won't it?

3774
04:02:02,760 --> 04:02:12,569
Doesn't does she have a shop? I think she sells some random shit doesn't she finger lady?

3775
04:02:13,659 --> 04:02:31,440
Oh, the finger lady does have a shop not just remembrances. Ooh

3776
04:02:36,139 --> 04:02:40,959
This thing is pretty cool

3777
04:02:40,959 --> 04:02:57,610
This is like fire. It's like a blood fire colossal hammer sharpened

3778
04:02:58,010 --> 04:03:05,819
Yeah, volcano fragment. I mean, it's 1800 i'm gonna buy it

3779
04:03:13,790 --> 04:03:16,430
Weapon rewards will be randomized if you bring the remembrances to her

3780
04:03:17,790 --> 04:03:27,950
Worth looking. Okay. Cool. Now you can finally play as me strong good point

3781
04:03:29,549 --> 04:03:37,680

Wisdom of the two fingers have you then I've been I am known as a tarnished eye onto us

3783
04:03:49,389 --> 04:03:53,149
We're a stir. We're in separate worlds just getting our shit together

3784
04:03:56,170 --> 04:04:00,809
Yeah, I gotta I gotta pick up my order. Do you I don't know. I can't drop this. I don't think

3785
04:04:01,950 --> 04:04:06,989
The litany of proper death creates an image of order to deal. Holy damage

3786
04:04:14,700 --> 04:04:16,700
Holy shit. I have so many

3787
04:04:17,180 --> 04:04:19,180
I have so many bearings

3788
04:04:21,000 --> 04:04:23,159
Holy shit. All right, we're gonna be here for a little while

3789
04:04:25,959 --> 04:04:33,399
Um god, can you try joining my world because i'm like bottlenecked until I get that and i'm already in the round table

3790
04:04:34,200 --> 04:04:35,799
Just a moment

3791
04:04:35,799 --> 04:04:40,030
Uh, oh you're in the right. Can I join you? You should be able to

3792
04:04:57,159 --> 04:05:00,239

04:05:00,879 --> 04:05:03,229

3794
04:05:03,229 --> 04:05:05,229
end of five

3795
04:05:05,549 --> 04:05:10,040
There you go. What the heck is braggart's roar?

3796
04:05:20,200 --> 04:05:25,000
Why is your door closed but mine is open? I don't know. That's weird

3797
04:05:25,559 --> 04:05:28,520
Oh, wait, let's see the dung eater. What are you dressed like?

3798
04:05:40,280 --> 04:05:43,559
All right, let's go over all this new shit that I have

3799
04:05:44,360 --> 04:05:55,680
the death root

3800
04:05:55,680 --> 04:05:57,680
Hi, I have it

3801
04:05:57,680 --> 04:06:02,670
Okay

3802
04:06:02,670 --> 04:06:04,190
Now we need

3803
04:06:04,190 --> 04:06:05,389
No, no, no

3804
04:06:05,389 --> 04:06:07,389
Do you have any faith talismans?

3805
04:06:08,760 --> 04:06:11,159
faith talismans like the stuff that boosts

3806
04:06:12,350 --> 04:06:14,909
Faith magic or anything weird like that that you're not using

3807
04:06:17,520 --> 04:06:19,520
Oh, let me find out

3808
04:06:25,959 --> 04:06:26,920
I have

3809
04:06:26,920 --> 04:06:30,200
Uh raises maximum fp raises decks

3810
04:06:34,510 --> 04:06:37,309
I don't think I have anything that boosts faith

3811
04:06:39,899 --> 04:06:47,309
I don't you can only see your other bell bearing shops because you used them in your solo game

3812
04:06:48,540 --> 04:06:50,540
Oh shit. Well, i'm leaving for a minute

3813
04:06:52,729 --> 04:06:55,739
You got the items, right?

3814
04:06:55,739 --> 04:06:58,559
Yeah, good

3815
04:06:58,559 --> 04:07:12,510
Oh shit, we're duping

3816
04:07:12,510 --> 04:07:19,020
golden land

3817
04:07:19,020 --> 04:07:20,700
Oh shit. I'm a cheater

3818
04:07:20,700 --> 04:07:23,920
I got rot breath with a plus 10 dragon seal

3819
04:07:24,799 --> 04:07:36,459
See how millennia likes it already used this one before

3820
04:07:39,940 --> 04:07:41,940
Eight thousand come on

3821
04:08:01,340 --> 04:08:03,340
Is that all the bell bearings I had

3822
04:08:03,340 --> 04:08:08,909
I feel like i've seen all this stuff already

3823
04:08:19,129 --> 04:08:24,750
by the soul

3824
04:08:24,750 --> 04:08:25,709
Hmm

3825
04:08:25,709 --> 04:08:38,780
I don't think I really want anything. I think i'm ready. I think i'm done. I need a you know

3826
04:08:38,860 --> 04:08:40,860
Like a new outfit to like impress you

3827
04:08:43,200 --> 04:08:47,069
I never will no matter how cute I look

3828
04:08:55,840 --> 04:09:37,440
Get the millennia sword

3829
04:09:37,680 --> 04:09:40,559
Where's the millennia's weapon? Oh this thing, right?

3830
04:09:42,159 --> 04:09:48,799
Oh 48 decks i'm never gonna do that. Yeah

3831
04:09:53,149 --> 04:09:53,950
i'm

3832
04:09:53,950 --> 04:09:58,350
Pretty much ready, but I am gonna do this because people are gonna be mad if I don't use this weapon

3833
04:09:58,670 --> 04:10:07,040
Okay, I need to get it ready. I did give you the stones. I gave you the stones and I really needed them

3834
04:10:07,979 --> 04:10:11,290
Um, well, I gave you stones earlier. So it's only fair

3835
04:10:28,110 --> 04:10:30,110
You want to be fair right there

3836
04:10:31,629 --> 04:10:37,790
All right. I'm ready. I'm gonna join. No, I probably shouldn't join you here. This has problems

3837
04:10:39,100 --> 04:10:44,219
Yeah, where are we going? Well

3838
04:10:46,170 --> 04:10:50,329
We could go we did this. Do you want to go do the um

3839
04:10:51,530 --> 04:10:52,409
we're

3840
04:10:52,409 --> 04:10:55,290
Placidusix is supposed to be that other dragon

3841
04:10:57,239 --> 04:11:02,920
Uh, do we have that quest on that quest? I don't know what we're supposed to do. Can we actually do it?

3842
04:11:03,950 --> 04:11:23,709
I doubt it of four to sex, right? Can we do four to sex? You gotta have the item

3843
04:11:24,270 --> 04:11:26,590
Now you need the finger slayer blade

3844
04:11:28,329 --> 04:11:32,329
We could go we could go give some death root really we both have a few that we haven't given

3845
04:11:33,209 --> 04:11:34,889
I have a great rune

3846
04:11:34,889 --> 04:11:37,280
So i'd like to go somewhere where we can activate it

3847
04:11:37,840 --> 04:11:41,930
one of the towers, um, which one is it the

3848
04:11:42,889 --> 04:11:47,440
Unborn

3849
04:11:47,440 --> 04:11:53,200
That I have the finger slayer blade you do. Ooh. All right. Well, then let's go back and do the fiaquest

3850
04:11:53,600 --> 04:12:03,920
So we need you to go. Let's just go do it, which is which teleport?

3851
04:12:04,319 --> 04:12:11,979
Uh the roots it's where we would just were right before we left that root place

3852
04:12:15,500 --> 04:12:17,899
Now you have to give the finger slayer blade to ronnie

3853
04:12:19,899 --> 04:12:20,540
Oh

3854
04:12:20,540 --> 04:12:28,700
Uh, that's right. So go to ronnie. You don't need the blade. I need the curse

3855
04:12:28,940 --> 04:12:40,159
Yeah, hopefully if you get it then I can play too need death mark. Not the blade. The blade is for ronnie

3856
04:12:44,010 --> 04:12:51,760
Ronnie is just like jealous

3857
04:12:51,760 --> 04:12:54,120
All right. Let's go

3858
04:12:55,739 --> 04:12:57,000
to

3859
04:12:57,000 --> 04:13:04,479
Ninth mount gelmere campsite and we're going to go back and we're going to run into altis plateau

3860
04:13:06,510 --> 04:13:08,329
Are you okay with that?

3861
04:13:08,329 --> 04:13:10,329
Uh, I need one second

3862
04:13:19,979 --> 04:13:23,340
Yeah, every quest is going to be a huge pain just because everything's just so everything's randomized

3863
04:13:23,420 --> 04:13:30,729
We might just we might just get stuck somewhere and have to turn around you get the death mark from killing millennia

3864
04:13:31,290 --> 04:13:35,629
But it'll be random every if we kill millennia. She'll give us like fucking dung

3865
04:13:43,360 --> 04:13:50,559
I am I am doing some nasty shit with fear right now. Um, are you ready to play the game?

3866
04:13:53,600 --> 04:13:57,360
I saw somebody in chat said hey dude, like i've been sitting here for like five ten straight minutes

3867
04:13:57,760 --> 04:14:02,559
I've got a big bunch of snacks. I got popcorn. I have like nachos and cheetos and shit

3868
04:14:02,959 --> 04:14:04,719
And I my popcorn is getting cold

3869
04:14:04,719 --> 04:14:07,840
I haven't been able to take one bite because I was waiting for you guys to start to do something

3870
04:14:08,840 --> 04:14:12,639
They're furious

3871
04:14:12,639 --> 04:14:16,719
He said he said he's holding it in like big like holding it all like popcorn

3872
04:14:16,799 --> 04:14:28,040
How come how come you got to be embraced by fia and I don't how is that any bit fair?

3873
04:14:37,180 --> 04:14:41,370
Okay, where where were we meeting? I was just seeing if I had an item the uh

3874
04:14:42,090 --> 04:14:46,090
Where are we meeting like where are we going? Like what what's happening? Like who are you aldous plateau?

3875
04:14:46,649 --> 04:14:52,350
So we're gonna go to the nine nine mount gilmer campsite and then from there we're gonna run to

3876
04:14:52,909 --> 04:15:06,079
Aldous plateau. Okay. Um, I believe my world is so we are going to this way. We want to go this way five

3877
04:15:06,639 --> 04:15:10,510
Three join my world now

3878
04:15:21,760 --> 04:15:34,139
Dude, I need to poop and I i'm not gonna read the rest of that. But okay. Oh you look different. What did you do?

3879
04:15:35,280 --> 04:15:41,870
All right, it's a race to get there go

3880
04:15:42,829 --> 04:15:49,530
Hey, how about the first person that gets there owes the other person?

3881
04:15:50,409 --> 04:15:56,399
20 bucks thousand dollars. I don't know where we're going

3882
04:15:57,260 --> 04:16:01,149
Uh, we're just following

3883
04:16:01,149 --> 04:16:03,629
First person to get there also follow me not that way

3884
04:16:22,379 --> 04:16:28,719
Weird like this is not where millennia is

3885
04:16:29,280 --> 04:16:33,319
No, it's not

3886
04:16:33,319 --> 04:16:34,600
another point

3887
04:16:34,600 --> 04:16:41,159
Okay, you know we never did we ever fight the way that um, like the meteorite

3888
04:16:41,719 --> 04:16:44,360
Demon thing was we didn't go all the way up there. Did we?

3889
04:16:45,000 --> 04:16:49,000
No, we didn't what was up there the tree spirit. Oh, this is tree spirit. That's right

3890
04:16:49,319 --> 04:17:01,840
You know what? We haven't done the dragon in the starting lake. It's true. Okay, continue

3891
04:17:12,239 --> 04:17:28,540
Going keep going

3892
04:17:29,260 --> 04:17:35,280
Hey, look at this grace right here. Yep

3893
04:17:35,520 --> 04:17:40,809
It's crazy

3894
04:17:40,809 --> 04:17:52,430
It's pretty crazy. There's also items galore first boss here is

3895
04:17:53,149 --> 04:17:55,209
you get

3896
04:17:55,209 --> 04:17:57,209
Uh like invaded by

3897
04:17:57,370 --> 04:18:00,510
Um, what's his name there?

3898
04:18:00,510 --> 04:18:04,760
Market, right?

3899
04:18:04,760 --> 04:18:07,450
Uh, oh we're going in the city

3900
04:18:07,530 --> 04:18:11,290
Well, isn't it right when you get through the front door of this, uh, alts plateau. He shows up, right?

3901
04:18:12,479 --> 04:18:14,879
Yeah, and he's like you aren't good enough

3902
04:18:15,440 --> 04:18:19,040
Okay, how do we get down? I think we have to go over here. I think you just jump

3903
04:18:19,600 --> 04:18:26,510
I think you go this way

3904
04:18:26,510 --> 04:18:28,510
It's your squid in a chair

3905
04:18:29,500 --> 04:18:31,500
That is a squid sitting in a chair

3906
04:18:31,659 --> 04:18:35,260
I'm beating you

3907
04:18:35,260 --> 04:18:37,899
It's not over yet until we get into alts plateau

3908
04:18:38,459 --> 04:18:53,200
It's a long ladder

3909
04:18:53,200 --> 04:18:57,930
Yeah, could you just hold b?

3910
04:18:58,010 --> 04:19:07,680
Hands kind of hurt when I do that

3911
04:19:07,680 --> 04:19:09,280
All right, watch out the lobster

3912
04:19:09,280 --> 04:19:28,090
Another dragon heart. Okay. Here we go

3913
04:19:33,799 --> 04:19:36,809
And your winner

3914
04:19:40,920 --> 04:19:48,319
Uh, how do you get down to the where mog is I thought you did that from no crone you

3915
04:19:51,129 --> 04:19:54,969
It's like a teleport from somewhere. I think oh from the

3916
04:19:55,770 --> 04:19:57,370
the four ways

3917
04:19:57,370 --> 04:20:01,549
Teleporters or it's yeah the the place with the blue keys

3918
04:20:03,239 --> 04:20:05,239
blue stone sword keys

3919
04:20:06,280 --> 04:20:09,260
Good theory

3920
04:20:09,260 --> 04:20:10,729
Okay

3921
04:20:10,729 --> 04:20:12,190
uh

3922
04:20:12,190 --> 04:20:17,819
Let's let's explore

3923
04:20:17,819 --> 04:20:19,819
Probably something interesting down here

3924
04:20:19,819 --> 04:20:31,840
Actually pretty useful

3925
04:20:31,840 --> 04:20:34,000
Is there ruins that go down here?

3926
04:20:36,299 --> 04:20:42,940
crab crab crab watch out crab. I see it

3927
04:20:44,299 --> 04:20:46,059
There is over by me

3928
04:20:46,059 --> 04:20:49,899
It's probably a bad idea to just walk up there with the horse

3929
04:20:51,899 --> 04:20:53,899
That's one of these guys. It's a mog like

3930
04:20:57,290 --> 04:21:05,229
I don't know. Is that thing bigger than normal?

3931
04:21:05,870 --> 04:21:17,340
But this thing is just right in front of me how

3932
04:21:24,860 --> 04:21:30,700
Why did I just hear is that a dragon? That's me. I'm dragon boy. I did no damage with that

3933
04:21:34,110 --> 04:21:36,110
Which is kind of surprising

3934
04:21:36,729 --> 04:21:38,489
Just lagging my game

3935
04:21:38,489 --> 04:21:42,510
All right, just come down here. Oh

3936
04:21:43,500 --> 04:21:45,280
Wait, no

3937
04:21:45,280 --> 04:21:46,639
Yeah, that's sad

3938
04:21:46,639 --> 04:21:49,100
We got a boss in here. You have to hold it

3939
04:21:54,809 --> 04:21:56,809
Oh you went downstairs

3940
04:21:58,090 --> 04:21:59,899
There is a boss

3941
04:21:59,899 --> 04:22:01,899

04:25:02,559 --> 04:25:04,239
That's a big ant

3971
04:25:04,239 --> 04:25:10,190
It's a crazy big shield. It's holding

They're incredibly hard to make

3990
04:26:55,120 --> 04:26:58,319
It takes a lot because you need to be like a professional chef

04:27:20,569 --> 04:27:26,120

3995
04:27:26,120 --> 04:27:28,809
Are you mocking me?

3996
04:27:28,809 --> 04:27:33,209
I mean i'm making just like a general joke about making a sloppy joe. Are you are you mocking me?

3997

You know what? I think you would like crack too

4000
04:27:51,260 --> 04:27:55,100
All right. This is a really important question for you stir. Do you put cheese on your sloppy joe? Yes or no?

4001
04:27:56,510 --> 04:27:59,149
Like on the bun. How do you smoke it or do you inject?

4002
04:28:02,190 --> 04:28:05,469
Cheese on my no. Okay. No, that's a good answer

4003
04:28:05,950 --> 04:28:10,110
That sounds fucked up. Like what was the point of making like a messy disgusting thing and you're gonna like

4004
04:28:11,899 --> 04:28:15,340
Some people put like a slice of like american cheese on it

4005
04:28:15,979 --> 04:28:21,959
And I don't agree

4006
04:28:22,040 --> 04:28:25,000
No, i've never had cheese on one. I feel like it's enough on its own

4007
04:28:25,950 --> 04:28:28,319
Yeah, i'm glad we agree

4008
04:28:30,750 --> 04:28:34,010
and the boss is

4009
04:28:34,010 --> 04:28:36,329
A free sentinel. Hopefully I think it's just a regular one

4010
04:28:50,219 --> 04:28:55,020
Yo, hold aggro for a second. I've got a big spell I can let loose charging up my spirit bomb

4058
04:33:56,909 --> 04:33:59,250
Hold on left in a backpack

4059
04:33:59,709 --> 04:34:04,430
What do you mean? What do you mean? I have to explain that because I that just I did not expect a human to say that

4060
04:34:05,819 --> 04:34:07,819
Well, is this like daisy?

4061
04:34:07,979 --> 04:34:10,860

4066
04:34:35,959 --> 04:34:39,240
I thought it was that didn't look that far that looked fine

4067
04:34:40,119 --> 04:34:43,389
All right. Anyways, what were you saying?

4068
04:34:44,110 --> 04:34:45,150
I

4069
04:34:45,150 --> 04:34:49,819
I don't got nothing to say

4070
04:34:49,819 --> 04:34:53,900
All right, you can tell him do it as a warning. I the short version of the story is

4071
04:34:54,860 --> 04:34:59,819
Me and ashley went to the grocery store yesterday to get food like a whole bunch of like the prepared grocery store meals

4072
04:35:00,060 --> 04:35:04,540
Okay, I was like, i'm i'm lazy. I just want like a whole bunch of these to eat. Okay, you mean for me

4073
04:35:04,939 --> 04:35:08,220
But when you say prepare it you mean it's like, okay, there's like a salmon in here

4074
04:35:08,220 --> 04:35:11,180
It's already seasoned and howard he has the stuff in it. You just put it in the oven

4075
04:35:11,419 --> 04:35:17,740
It's just like a cold cuts a pork chop with like some potatoes and green beans like ready to go in the oven. Yes

4076
04:35:18,139 --> 04:35:24,540
Yeah, nothing wrong with that. Yeah, and we walk we don't drive so it's like all in a backpack so we could walk back with it

4077
04:35:25,180 --> 04:35:27,720
and uh, you know just

4078
04:35:27,720 --> 04:35:30,200
I went to go eat them. I was like excited like oh shit

4079
04:35:30,200 --> 04:35:32,520
I've got so much food and I went to go get and there was uh, you know

4080
04:35:32,520 --> 04:35:34,520
It was all still in the backpack

4081
04:35:35,240 --> 04:35:38,599
Like the next day so you just had a bunch of fucking food

4082
04:35:39,319 --> 04:35:41,400
Oh, that's one you ate one

4083
04:35:42,750 --> 04:35:50,110
Stirrer, I ate one stir. You ate a backpack meal. That was like raw food in a backpack. Yeah

4084
04:35:52,169 --> 04:35:55,930
24 hours had gone by I you're saying it like I didn't cook it first

4085
04:35:56,009 --> 04:36:01,159
I did cook it and it wasn't it was maybe I don't know it was overnight like 16 hours

4086
04:36:02,279 --> 04:36:05,080
I think you're missing a lot of the finer points here. I don't know dude

4087
04:36:05,240 --> 04:36:08,520
Have you ever watched one of those food time lapse videos?

4088
04:36:10,330 --> 04:36:15,290
Where it shows like one hour two hour five hour six hour and then they fucking ants to start coming in and grubs

4089
04:36:15,610 --> 04:36:19,130
Well, it is sealed inside of a thing. There's like not ants getting in it

4090
04:36:22,970 --> 04:36:27,290
What kind of food was so you took so this was uh, so you opened up the backpack and you were like

4091
04:36:27,689 --> 04:36:30,970
Oh like oh like you must have stunk

4092
04:36:31,689 --> 04:36:39,200
It honestly didn't and then I unsealed the wrap on it and I touched the meat and it was like a little cold

4093
04:36:39,439 --> 04:36:46,759
And I was like, hmm like it was colder than my my hand was you know, it felt a little cooler touch

4094
04:36:46,919 --> 04:36:50,919
So then you were just like, you know what fuck it i'm just gonna put this in the oven like if I die

4095
04:36:53,340 --> 04:36:55,950

4098
04:37:09,880 --> 04:37:16,240
Uh, I ate it yesterday. Uh, I gotta say I felt a little weird, but i'm good. You feel a little weird now

4099
04:37:18,000 --> 04:37:25,040
Um, I think i'm good. Are you coming like i'm at the castle i'm sorry

4100
04:37:25,200 --> 04:37:30,139
I'm can't tell you that i've been paying that much attention to the game when I heard that you ate food

4101
04:37:30,220 --> 04:37:32,220
That's been in a backpack for a fucking day

4102
04:37:32,700 --> 04:37:34,520
It looks fine

4103
04:37:34,520 --> 04:37:39,080
No, the fucking bear grills is like eating his own shit. No, no, no, no

4104
04:37:39,240 --> 04:37:43,639
I'm telling you right now you're I know you're about to go down this path of oh, what are you talking about?

4105
04:37:43,639 --> 04:37:45,639
Like you probably would no

4106
04:37:46,040 --> 04:37:52,599
No, I would not if if I had like a pork chop that was raw that was on the counter for 16 hours

4107
04:37:53,080 --> 04:37:55,209
I would not eat it

4108
04:37:55,209 --> 04:37:59,930
But there's like no other food because that's all the food you got for yourself. I would figure something. I would figure something out

4109
04:38:01,259 --> 04:38:08,650
Yeah, I would something out. I would eat anything else anything else. No, that's not happening

4110
04:38:11,340 --> 04:38:14,220
Especially if it's like raw food that's just sitting there

4111
04:38:15,290 --> 04:38:18,729
What is the the this of the what's the time? It's two hours, right?

4112
04:38:19,130 --> 04:38:25,240
Two hours is like when bacteria really starts to grab a hold of food, right when it's out a bit of bacteria is good for you

4113
04:38:25,799 --> 04:38:28,680
It's four. Okay, so four hours went by

4114
04:38:30,459 --> 04:38:35,419
Okay. Well, hopefully you don't have any issues. All right. I don't know where the fuck i'm going right now

4115
04:38:38,680 --> 04:38:46,700
Stuart can we teleport back to the windmill village and can you help me this fucker's judging my fucking backpack?

4116
04:38:47,610 --> 04:38:54,110
Raw meat meal doesn't even know where he's going. I gotta say though. Actually, I was kind of dizzy yesterday

4117
04:38:54,349 --> 04:38:59,389
Bridges didn't exist for thousands of years in human history. Yes, but they were curing their meats

4118
04:39:00,189 --> 04:39:02,189
It's not the same. It's not it was

4119
04:39:03,610 --> 04:39:11,049
That's stirs fucking musty ass backpack is not a curing environment for for food

4120
04:39:11,959 --> 04:39:15,000
That's not okay. I ain't gonna have that happen

4121
04:39:20,799 --> 04:39:25,520
Do you want to I mean you'll be proud of me at the very least that there was coconut shrimp in there. Ooh

4122
04:39:26,889 --> 04:39:29,369
Everything we talk. Yeah, you're absolved of all these crimes

4123
04:39:29,849 --> 04:39:34,569
Okay, well I was just gonna say I didn't eat the coconut shrimp actually was like that's fish and I was like a good argument

4124
04:39:34,569 --> 04:39:36,569
Good point. Oh, yeah, don't eat that

4125
04:39:36,889 --> 04:39:43,180
But somehow eat what was what was the food the actual food you ate the actual food was pork chops and potatoes

4126
04:39:43,180 --> 04:39:45,180
That's just that's just as bad

4127
04:39:45,340 --> 04:39:51,119
It's not fish raw pork is arguably probably I would even say maybe even potentially worse

4128
04:39:54,880 --> 04:39:56,880
Fucking it was like eight bucks, dude

4129
04:40:01,549 --> 04:40:03,549
Fucking for real right now

4130
04:40:03,630 --> 04:40:05,229
Uh-oh, look out

4131
04:40:05,229 --> 04:40:10,000
They don't even shoot raw fish is sushi though

4132
04:40:10,400 --> 04:40:15,919
Well raw fish is sushi, but it's not sushi. That's been sitting on the restaurant table for 16 hours

4133
04:40:17,869 --> 04:40:20,189
Yeah, we left the sushi out overnight in our backpack

4134
04:40:22,029 --> 04:40:24,029
Fucking disgusting

4135
04:40:27,520 --> 04:40:32,479
Honestly, what do they do to sushi? No, but hey, hey, please people are telling me that I have this wrong

4136
04:40:32,799 --> 04:40:37,680
We're not talking about a tv dinner. We're talking about it's it was raw food that you had to put in the oven and cook it

4137
04:40:38,080 --> 04:40:40,080
Yeah, it was just like raw pork chop

4138
04:40:40,240 --> 04:40:43,520
See, it's it's not like a tv dinner. It's not like stoffers

4139
04:40:47,020 --> 04:40:52,299
Just like in them in like an aluminum tray with like uh plastic wrap around it pork chop

4140
04:40:54,439 --> 04:40:55,240
I

4141
04:40:55,240 --> 04:40:57,240
I actually can't believe you ate that

4142
04:40:58,299 --> 04:41:01,759
Honestly same though

4143
04:41:01,759 --> 04:41:06,240
So what was the scenario? You're just like, you know what? I don't care what happens to me

4144
04:41:06,400 --> 04:41:11,520
I'm just gonna eat thinking about it for like a day and I like had no other food and I looked at them all

4145
04:41:11,599 --> 04:41:14,720
And I was like, you know what?

4146
04:41:14,720 --> 04:41:16,720
Well, if you feel

4147
04:41:17,200 --> 04:41:18,400
There he is

4148
04:41:18,400 --> 04:41:20,400
Oh shit

4149
04:41:24,799 --> 04:41:27,040
That was he's not really that scary actually

4150
04:41:27,919 --> 04:41:39,240
Hey, honestly if I were him too, I wouldn't say anything either

4151
04:41:42,040 --> 04:41:46,279
You just shut up and disconnect as quick as you can. Yeah, just just literally pull your ethernet cable up

4152
04:41:48,409 --> 04:41:55,000
And make a new account

4153
04:41:55,000 --> 04:41:57,159
It's like what are the signs that like if I have worms?

4154
04:42:01,439 --> 04:42:02,959
um

4155
04:42:02,959 --> 04:42:05,439
Probably gastric upset I would say probably number one

4156
04:42:06,240 --> 04:42:07,200
uh

4157
04:42:07,200 --> 04:42:14,560
Is that a talisman not what the hell is that?

4158
04:42:18,080 --> 04:42:19,279
uh

4159
04:42:19,279 --> 04:42:21,740
gastric issues

4160
04:42:21,740 --> 04:42:23,580
I would say

4161
04:42:23,580 --> 04:42:24,860
diarrhea

4162
04:42:24,860 --> 04:42:26,299
How have you been?

4163
04:42:26,299 --> 04:42:28,299
You think I'd feel a little tickle?

4164
04:42:29,150 --> 04:42:35,150
I would imagine you would feel quite a few gurgles if it were if it were me answering

4165
04:42:35,790 --> 04:42:37,150
so

4166
04:42:37,150 --> 04:42:40,349
I know that like everyone whenever they're talking about hand

4167
04:42:41,150 --> 04:42:42,990
uh the thumb

4168
04:42:42,990 --> 04:42:44,990
is always the uh

4169
04:42:45,229 --> 04:42:48,669
Kind of the hero of the hand everyone's like, oh that's a human hand the thumb

4170
04:42:49,229 --> 04:42:52,669
How do you feel about like I I feel like fingernails are kind of underrated

4171
04:42:53,229 --> 04:42:59,470
Not even remotely close to thumbs not even close. In fact, I think I think the raw pork is is mutated your brain at this point

4172
04:43:00,349 --> 04:43:02,349
I think the raw pork is mutated his brain

4173
04:43:03,069 --> 04:43:06,990
You think that an opposable thumb is not as important as your fingernails

4174
04:43:07,069 --> 04:43:10,990
Can you imagine not having like fingernails and just having like just like normal?

4175
04:43:12,590 --> 04:43:14,590
I think these these are the worms talking

4176
04:43:19,869 --> 04:43:25,869
I yeah, I think scientists have said that eventually we might just evolve them out like they just won't exist anymore

4177
04:43:26,189 --> 04:43:28,669
Really? I think so. That's that's been a debate. I

4178
04:43:29,630 --> 04:43:31,630
I use them so much though like

4179
04:43:32,349 --> 04:43:36,349
You have to like really pick at something on like um, like you drop something between your keyboard

4180
04:43:36,430 --> 04:43:39,069
Like how are you gonna get it out if you don't have fingernails? I mean

4181
04:43:39,790 --> 04:43:43,389
That's one tiny shitty little thing to you. I mean you could use like a

4182
04:43:44,669 --> 04:43:46,669
That's like we're we're using them

4183
04:43:47,479 --> 04:43:51,240
I don't my fingernails are used i'm trying like scratching my ass

4184
04:43:53,360 --> 04:43:57,200
I think i'm just all i'm saying is I don't think fingernails get enough credit because the thumb

4185
04:43:57,680 --> 04:44:02,479
Takes all the fucking all right. Give me a fingernail tier list of things you can do with it

4186
04:44:02,479 --> 04:44:05,119
That's what what are you saying is like, okay number one

4187
04:44:06,159 --> 04:44:07,439
Do you not?

4188
04:44:07,439 --> 04:44:13,919
Because picking up like a coin on your desk if that's s tier for you. I'm sorry that that is a good example

4189
04:44:14,000 --> 04:44:16,000
Thank you. I didn't even have to come up with that one

4190
04:44:16,720 --> 04:44:18,400
That's like d

4191
04:44:18,400 --> 04:44:22,169
You ever like scratch a dog?

4192
04:44:22,409 --> 04:44:27,450
Yeah, that's gone. If you can't like really get underneath the like the fur and like give them a real good scratch

4193
04:44:29,560 --> 04:44:33,159
You can't do that without fingernails. All right, we like we're just walking in circles

4194
04:44:34,639 --> 04:44:36,639
I think you could still get like friction

4195
04:44:37,439 --> 04:44:40,759
Hold on a second

4196
04:44:40,759 --> 04:44:51,069
Your dog would know the difference it still works. What about peeling an orange?

4197
04:44:52,459 --> 04:44:54,779
True you never never

4198
04:44:55,740 --> 04:45:01,020
I uh when I was young sorry for uh, you know, uh sensory overload alert don't listen

4199
04:45:01,659 --> 04:45:04,060
Uh, one of my my big toenail came clean off

4200
04:45:05,680 --> 04:45:11,680
And I gotta tell you uh, certainly appreciate it having toenails after that. I can only imagine for fingers

4201
04:45:12,479 --> 04:45:16,000
Every single person in the whole world that's here. Just all of us went

4202
04:45:17,819 --> 04:45:20,779
I gave the sensory overload warning. It was fair game

4203
04:45:22,560 --> 04:45:26,400
Um sensory overload I think is like if you were to dance while singing

4204
04:45:27,040 --> 04:45:30,799
Not like hey, this is disgusting. I just got right. Oh, I got a rune

4205
04:45:32,970 --> 04:45:36,810
Great rune of the unborn. Oh, that's um, very lucarious, isn't it?

4206
04:45:37,209 --> 04:45:40,729
I got dragon cult prayer book. What do you do with that? Because i'm kind of

4207
04:45:41,450 --> 04:45:43,130
Using the dragon thing

4208
04:45:43,130 --> 04:45:44,830
I think you can now

4209
04:45:44,830 --> 04:45:47,520
raft stuff

4210
04:45:47,520 --> 04:45:49,520
All right. Where is this? Uh

4211
04:45:49,840 --> 04:45:51,709
Oh, yeah

4212
04:45:51,709 --> 04:45:54,990
Yeah, maybe like a gross out warning not a sensory overload

4213
04:45:55,310 --> 04:46:00,750
I gotta say I feel bad that everyone is upset that I told them something bad happened to me and not like

4214
04:46:01,740 --> 04:46:05,599
Sensory they don't they don't feel bad for me sensory overload here about it

4215
04:46:05,680 --> 04:46:10,799
No sensory overload is if you were like, hey, just want to tell you sensory overload. I got a story to tell you

4216
04:46:11,599 --> 04:46:14,799
So when I was uh, again, you know what I mean? That's that's sensory overload

4217
04:46:17,799 --> 04:46:20,189
You didn't see what I did

4218
04:46:20,189 --> 04:46:22,750
But that to me is sensory overload

4219
04:46:22,750 --> 04:46:26,669
Where the fuck are we going? Where's the entry or like if you started like doing like spells and like flashing a bunch of stuff

4220
04:46:26,750 --> 04:46:29,310
On the screen and if I started doing spells

4221
04:46:29,470 --> 04:46:34,110
Yeah, if you were casting spells and like and they were like screams and like sound effects sound effects sound effects

4222
04:46:35,869 --> 04:46:37,869
I use the wrong term. Hold on this

4223
04:46:39,950 --> 04:46:55,919
Come on here. We have a problem. What we have a double boss scenario here. Oh god

4224
04:46:56,319 --> 04:46:59,520
I think we focus the one on the right first

4225
04:47:09,500 --> 04:47:12,540
Uh there the boss does not care that we're doing this

4226
04:47:13,340 --> 04:47:15,560
Okay. Well that was good

4227
04:47:15,560 --> 04:47:18,279
That actually saves us a lot of pain and suffering

4228
04:47:19,080 --> 04:47:23,959
Did we get any other guy we could just I can hit him with a dragon breath

4229
04:47:24,520 --> 04:47:39,020
Okay, go for it. Oh my god

4230
04:47:39,740 --> 04:47:41,740
Insta-dej, I never even got up

4231
04:47:42,540 --> 04:47:44,540
Where the hell did I just end up?

4232
04:47:45,869 --> 04:47:47,869
It's okay. We can serve him from the spawn

4233
04:47:50,909 --> 04:47:56,830
You just like you just changed you just changed the weather and it just fucked me up so bad. Oh, sorry

4234
04:47:57,389 --> 04:48:08,080
Really

4235
04:48:20,590 --> 04:48:23,470
No, it does not are you serious

4236
04:48:24,110 --> 04:48:28,509
Are you serious? I don't want to laugh because it's like kind of like not good if that's happening to you

4237
04:48:28,830 --> 04:48:32,909
I don't want to like laugh. But are you all right? I don't have uh,

4238
04:48:33,709 --> 04:48:37,040
I don't have anything else to eat

4239
04:48:37,770 --> 04:48:40,250
Dude you all right. Can I tell you what you really should do tonight?

4240
04:48:41,310 --> 04:48:42,189
just

4241
04:48:42,189 --> 04:48:45,310
Like make some like just rice just make some rice

4242
04:48:46,639 --> 04:48:50,560
And eat a little bit of rice and like some toast and don't eat anything else

4243
04:48:51,200 --> 04:48:53,680
Don't eat any more backpack daisy food

4244
04:49:05,389 --> 04:49:10,959
Whoops, but I rest it so I probably reset it. I don't know where you are. You did

4245
04:49:12,189 --> 04:49:14,750
Oh great. I don't know why I didn't spawn at this long

4246
04:49:15,549 --> 04:49:19,099
Because I definitely

4247
04:49:19,099 --> 04:49:23,180
Dude, you were fighting the whole time then you were like doing good. I actually was doing well

4248
04:49:23,340 --> 04:49:28,619
I had him down to like 40 34 35 percent. Honestly, we have to fight him fight them both again

4249
04:49:29,580 --> 04:49:31,880
We have to kill this. How about we just don't

4250
04:49:32,360 --> 04:49:34,540
This is a boss. You should like heal

4251
04:49:35,259 --> 04:49:40,619
Don't worry about me and worry about the fucking like diarrhea. You're gonna have in 40 minutes

4252
04:49:55,689 --> 04:49:57,689
Beware of the scarlet rot

4253
04:50:06,380 --> 04:50:10,330
Wow, you're not doing too well

4254
04:50:10,330 --> 04:50:11,849
Have I died?

4255
04:50:11,849 --> 04:50:13,849
I don't see a death thing on the screen

4256
04:50:14,409 --> 04:50:16,360
Well, congrats

4257
04:50:16,360 --> 04:50:18,840
You were just waiting just you were waiting like is low

4258
04:50:23,099 --> 04:50:25,020
Mo like is dead

4259
04:50:25,020 --> 04:50:28,139
All right. Oh, okay

4260
04:50:32,650 --> 04:50:46,830
Wow

4261
04:50:46,830 --> 04:50:49,069
Oh, that's what that is

4262
04:50:51,560 --> 04:50:56,680
Am I not how am I not hitting this person because uh, because he had made a grab animation so you can't oh

4263
04:50:57,400 --> 04:50:59,400
He was using he was like he's like using a door

4264
04:51:00,919 --> 04:51:14,330
I could reset it again. I we're not quite dead yet

4265
04:51:15,290 --> 04:51:18,299
It could be it could be much worse right now

4266
04:51:18,700 --> 04:51:21,319
It's a really bad place for him to be doing this

4267
04:51:22,669 --> 04:51:26,349
Come over here. Come over here. I had I got the heal ready. I don't

4268
04:51:27,229 --> 04:51:29,229
It's just

4269
04:51:31,639 --> 04:51:33,639
I'm helping i'm helping come on

4270
04:51:34,139 --> 04:51:35,259
focus

4271
04:51:35,259 --> 04:51:36,860
You're not focused

4272
04:51:36,860 --> 04:51:38,860
I gotta get that down. He keeps doing it

4273
04:51:39,259 --> 04:52:06,680
He's doing power

4274
04:52:06,680 --> 04:52:08,680
Watch out for his ultimate power

4275
04:52:11,959 --> 04:52:13,959
Oh fuck he comes down with it

4276
04:52:14,520 --> 04:52:22,000
I'm gonna go reset it

4277
04:52:22,000 --> 04:52:24,000
We haven't lost yet

4278
04:52:28,029 --> 04:52:34,830
Yeah, but this isn't going well. It's we had he's at 50 percent. It's we're okay

4279
04:52:35,790 --> 04:52:43,000
I mentally give up

4280
04:52:43,880 --> 04:52:45,880
Mentally you can't give up

4281
04:52:47,259 --> 04:52:49,099
Don't give up

4282
04:52:49,099 --> 04:52:51,099
Don't give up. Don't give up

4283
04:52:51,979 --> 04:52:53,419
Sora

4284
04:52:53,419 --> 04:52:55,419
Just imagine this is millennia

4285
04:52:55,580 --> 04:52:58,459
You know what I mean? This is my millennia

4286
04:52:58,779 --> 04:53:00,619
I hate this enemy

4287
04:53:00,619 --> 04:53:19,680
All right. I'm gonna be honest if I had like

4288
04:53:20,240 --> 04:53:24,319
Stir with 10 fucking effort. We would probably have already beat this

4289
04:53:25,200 --> 04:53:26,799
That's fucked up

4290
04:53:26,799 --> 04:53:31,919
How do I get out run?

4291
04:53:31,919 --> 04:53:38,380
Fucking sigma

4292
04:53:50,110 --> 04:53:52,799
You reset I had

4293
04:53:52,799 --> 04:53:53,919
you

4294
04:53:53,919 --> 04:53:57,919
Okay, I only had like a few I had you reset it and I was still fighting the enemy

4295
04:53:58,159 --> 04:54:01,520
So I lost out on like four heals because you reset it the first time

4296
04:54:02,080 --> 04:54:04,080
Okay, we'll come back

4297
04:54:04,700 --> 04:54:06,139
I can't

4298
04:54:06,139 --> 04:54:08,479
So you can't no

4299
04:54:08,479 --> 04:54:10,479
Then why was I able to come back?

4300
04:54:10,720 --> 04:54:22,319
Maybe you're the host

4301
04:54:22,319 --> 04:54:24,439
You can do it

4302
04:54:24,439 --> 04:54:26,439
I took this boss's health down

4303
04:54:27,000 --> 04:54:28,119
like

4304
04:54:28,200 --> 04:54:29,880
70 percent

4305
04:54:29,880 --> 04:54:34,810
Yeah, but he just like spams

4306
04:54:35,840 --> 04:54:37,840
Like he doesn't even play the game like right

4307
04:54:43,680 --> 04:54:47,919
You know what I mean? Yeah, that's definitely like a like a soul caliber fan take

4308
04:54:48,799 --> 04:55:06,439
Okay

4309
04:55:06,439 --> 04:55:09,479
That missed me and you saw it you saw that it missed it actually kind of looked like it did

4310
04:55:12,799 --> 04:55:15,229
Okay, can you take this seriously?

4311
04:55:15,229 --> 04:55:18,590
He's also I guarantee you this dude's gonna drop nothing

4312
04:55:19,150 --> 04:55:21,150
There's a there's a if you look down at your controller

4313
04:55:21,470 --> 04:55:22,590
As I um

4314
04:55:22,590 --> 04:55:28,009
I wasn't doing this for a little while the first like a little bit that I was playing but if you look down

4315
04:55:28,830 --> 04:55:32,189
There's a red b button and if you press that you dodge

4316
04:55:32,909 --> 04:55:33,709
um

4317
04:55:33,709 --> 04:55:37,389
You should press that when there's like a right at the moment right before you get hit

4318
04:55:37,709 --> 04:55:42,590
I just didn't know if you know i'll try but my game crashed

4319
04:55:43,389 --> 04:55:52,509
Fuck so bad. My game crashed mine's crashed too

4320
04:55:58,060 --> 04:56:12,360
Well, let's try it again last time somebody gave you that advice germa. You growled at them. Yeah, I know

4321
04:56:12,919 --> 04:56:14,919
Why that's why I thought it was

4322
04:56:15,799 --> 04:56:17,240
No, I really did

4323
04:56:17,240 --> 04:56:23,720
I was fighting that lightning tree sentinel outside the city and I was having some trouble

4324
04:56:25,580 --> 04:56:28,779
And the person's like what they say was hey, dude

4325
04:56:28,779 --> 04:56:34,040
I don't know if you know this but the horse has a dodge and I just I just it just did it

4326
04:56:34,520 --> 04:56:39,770
I just I went off

4327
04:56:39,770 --> 04:56:43,470
Uh, I think my game is actually broken

4328
04:56:44,439 --> 04:56:47,979
Uh mod bat. Yep, not the that's the one I just did

4329
04:56:48,840 --> 04:56:59,959
Well, I'm in it's almost like the process is still going hold on. Yeah. Elden ring is still technically running

4330
04:57:08,840 --> 04:57:15,450
Coming back. I'm sorry to bring it up again, but I really gotta say

4331
04:57:16,169 --> 04:57:21,290
I feel like I ate that pork and I got away with it and there's kind of a thrill

4332
04:57:28,680 --> 04:57:34,220
Okay, uh, you say that now and in potentially a few hours from now

4333
04:57:35,150 --> 04:57:38,830
On your fourth vomit into the toilet. You're gonna be like that was a dumb thing

4334
04:57:39,630 --> 04:57:43,229
I ate it yesterday afternoon. I think if I was gonna get sick, I'd be sick by now

4335
04:57:44,380 --> 04:57:46,119
that's true

4336
04:57:46,119 --> 04:57:48,200
I really feel like like I fucking

4337
04:57:49,529 --> 04:57:50,650
You know like

4338
04:57:50,650 --> 04:57:52,650
I played the gamble and I won

4339
04:57:53,130 --> 04:57:56,009
Don't get used to that. Don't get used to oh, yeah

4340
04:57:56,009 --> 04:58:01,209
You know what? Uh, if I that means I could probably do that again and be completely and totally fine

4341
04:58:01,290 --> 04:58:05,610
No, you lucked out big time. Wasn't there some youtuber who used to like eat shoes?

4342
04:58:09,020 --> 04:58:16,939
I have no idea

4343
04:58:16,939 --> 04:58:20,169
that's

4344
04:58:20,169 --> 04:58:23,610
I don't know. That's your justification for this. It's like no, no, no, no

4345
04:58:23,610 --> 04:58:25,610
You see there's a guy that used to eat shoes

4346
04:58:25,930 --> 04:58:27,930
Uh, what is his name?

4347
04:58:28,779 --> 04:58:30,779
What's his name shoe night?

4348
04:58:31,500 --> 04:58:33,500
He named himself after what he ate

4349
04:58:36,159 --> 04:58:44,159
All right. You ready to fight? Yeah. Yeah, let's like like focus the guy the easy guy in the right

4350
04:58:45,040 --> 04:58:47,840
Full he says stir you could have worms and you might not know it

4351
04:58:48,479 --> 04:58:52,400
You know, hey, do you like fucking cooked it? Do you doesn't matter? Do you like garlic?

4352
04:58:53,840 --> 04:58:56,639
Are you telling me that worms are immune to heat?

4353
04:58:57,040 --> 04:59:03,119
Worms don't like garlic is the thing i've heard. I don't know. It's I think worms actually don't like garlic

4354
04:59:04,080 --> 04:59:07,520
That's real, right? I heard worms don't like your fucking stream, dude

4355
04:59:10,240 --> 04:59:14,479
Let me heal you. You could save flasks. You know what I mean? Like a greater heal right here

4356
04:59:17,759 --> 04:59:19,900
Hey

4357
04:59:19,900 --> 04:59:26,080
Hello

4358
04:59:26,080 --> 04:59:28,159
How did I get hit by that? How are you 20 bucks?

4359
04:59:30,080 --> 04:59:32,639
You just randomly like yeah 20 bucks

4360
04:59:40,759 --> 04:59:42,759
Where is he going?

4361
04:59:43,560 --> 04:59:47,159
Can you hold his aggro for a sec it's it's happening right now do whatever you want to do

4362
04:59:48,040 --> 04:59:52,939
Okay. Well if he hit me

4363
04:59:52,939 --> 04:59:57,580
He's looking at me

4364
04:59:57,580 --> 05:00:00,060
You hit him harder. He's like doesn't care that you're doing this

4365
05:00:00,700 --> 05:00:05,310
How much do you shut the fuck up?

4366
05:00:18,889 --> 05:00:25,520
Hi up

4367
05:00:25,520 --> 05:00:27,520
Dude, look at this dps. We've already done

4368
05:00:32,779 --> 05:00:34,779
I ran in front of him

4369
05:00:53,180 --> 05:01:04,759
No, he's angry with you. Oh

4370
05:01:14,220 --> 05:01:16,220
Ace two ace two dude

4371
05:01:17,229 --> 05:01:18,909
All right, dude, we got this

4372
05:01:18,909 --> 05:01:21,790
Just saw a fucking strategy guide on this shit

4373
05:01:25,880 --> 05:01:27,880
They said it's actually

4374
05:01:27,880 --> 05:01:33,000
You gotta avoid you gotta like there's a dodge button. It's b on the controller right before you get hit

4375
05:01:33,799 --> 05:01:38,700
You gotta press it

4376
05:01:38,700 --> 05:01:42,990
Oh, look at that. I did it

4377
05:01:42,990 --> 05:01:44,990
Where the fuck is he going?

4378
05:01:45,150 --> 05:01:48,189
This is I

4379
05:01:48,189 --> 05:01:51,200
I think he's stuck

4380
05:01:51,200 --> 05:01:54,000
That's actually he's kind of bad because yeah, he'll do that

4381
05:02:17,069 --> 05:02:21,840
watch out

4382
05:02:21,840 --> 05:02:23,599
Dude, he's coming for you, dude

4383
05:02:23,599 --> 05:02:31,599
You get some hips in while he's focused on me

4384
05:02:32,159 --> 05:02:35,610
I'm gonna get hit by this but sorry

4385
05:02:36,700 --> 05:02:42,299
I went in the wrong part

4386
05:02:42,299 --> 05:02:44,299
Why did that take me so long to get up?

4387
05:02:45,279 --> 05:03:22,560
Uh, it hit me really weird. I don't know what happened. The choke is real right there. You're running. There's one ahead of him

4388
05:03:23,369 --> 05:03:25,209
Oh my god

4389
05:03:25,209 --> 05:03:30,860
He's gonna grab you. No, he's not you dude. You're writing his fucking ma dude. He's got you with the next one

4390
05:03:33,770 --> 05:03:35,529
You're so fucking bad

4391
05:03:35,529 --> 05:03:37,340
last hit

4392
05:03:37,340 --> 05:03:44,330
easy

4393
05:03:44,330 --> 05:03:46,330
Hey, by the way, you're

4394
05:03:46,409 --> 05:03:50,729
You are so fucking happy that this just happened because I just got an ability

4395
05:03:51,130 --> 05:03:52,970
I got a thing that you

4396
05:03:52,970 --> 05:03:57,049
Are going to be obsessed with and by you. I mean me get an item

4397
05:04:00,000 --> 05:04:02,479
This is probably the best trinket in the whole game

4398
05:04:04,319 --> 05:04:06,639
maximum hp stamina equipment load

4399
05:04:11,340 --> 05:04:16,000
Disgusting. Oh dude, is that the fucking the one with the talisman with the thing?

4400
05:04:16,560 --> 05:04:20,240
I get plus two equipment load plus two stamina plus two max health

4401
05:04:21,130 --> 05:04:23,130
best trinket in the game is

4402
05:04:24,880 --> 05:04:28,880
Stir whatever you do. Don't put the garlic next to your butthole. The worms might crawl even deeper

4403
05:04:29,979 --> 05:04:33,419
I didn't say that on my stream. I just want to make sure everyone knows you didn't okay

4404
05:04:37,340 --> 05:04:39,419
All right. So so true my friend

4405
05:04:40,299 --> 05:04:41,500
we

4406
05:04:41,500 --> 05:04:52,490
Getting into the capital is interesting from here. I hope I hope they respond

4407
05:04:54,200 --> 05:04:58,380
They actually might

4408
05:04:58,380 --> 05:05:01,180
Okay, so there's a few ways to get into the capital

4409
05:05:02,970 --> 05:05:06,599
But we could also your favorite you want to let's do the archery

4410
05:05:07,000 --> 05:05:12,270
Go to the outer wall battleground and let's do the archery. Actually. Yeah, can we do it from there?

4411
05:05:19,240 --> 05:05:21,639
Why are all these hills so dang close range?

4412
05:05:22,279 --> 05:05:29,439
Because it'd be really powerful if you could just do that and heal everybody

4413
05:05:29,680 --> 05:05:45,900
Sorry, I assumed you didn't know tv dinners were pre-cooked. I thought stir was just eating a soggy hungry man. No

4414
05:05:47,470 --> 05:05:49,470
No, that's not. Yeah, that's

4415
05:05:50,270 --> 05:05:53,439
In fact, I would I don't think there's anything wrong with that

4416
05:05:55,080 --> 05:06:01,630
Like that's all right. Why why would it be a soggy hungry man? We're like like I would still cook it

4417
05:06:02,110 --> 05:06:18,159
All right, let's do the archery soggy cooked. Yeah, i'm saying that that wouldn't be that big of a deal

4418
05:06:18,159 --> 05:06:27,159
That wouldn't be a problem to me. You're talking to somebody that actually really genuinely does not

4419
05:06:27,720 --> 05:06:28,919
hate

4420
05:06:28,919 --> 05:06:33,400
Those salisbury steak tv dinners and I talked about this already and everyone was like what the fuck is wrong with you?

4421
05:06:34,490 --> 05:06:36,970
There I they're okay. I don't hate those

4422
05:06:39,659 --> 05:06:43,130
That whole meal is soggy. Do you like sushi?

4423
05:06:45,310 --> 05:06:47,549
Very occasionally. Yes

4424
05:06:50,000 --> 05:06:53,130
Wrong I like

4425
05:06:53,450 --> 05:06:54,729
I

4426
05:06:54,729 --> 05:06:56,729
Hey, hey convince me. Otherwise

4427
05:06:59,290 --> 05:07:02,009
Can you convince me? What what do they do to sushi?

4428
05:07:03,880 --> 05:07:04,840
they

4429
05:07:04,840 --> 05:07:11,479
Cut it up and they put it over a thing of rice or in a roll. They don't like they don't do they don't do anything

4430
05:07:11,720 --> 05:07:19,400
Some depends some places do correct me if i'm wrong. Some places do like steam it right for like a certain amount of time

4431
05:07:20,750 --> 05:07:22,990
um, if a traditional sushi is just they

4432
05:07:24,959 --> 05:07:26,400
just fish

4433
05:07:26,400 --> 05:07:28,720
Sometimes they'll freeze it

4434
05:07:28,720 --> 05:07:30,720
Like if I didn't want to cook I wouldn't eat

4435
05:07:32,330 --> 05:07:34,200
You know what I mean?

4436
05:07:34,200 --> 05:07:36,040
sushi is

4437
05:07:36,040 --> 05:07:38,299
Okay

4438
05:07:38,299 --> 05:07:42,700
I don't like eating a lot of it if you get oh, this is a salmon roll

4439
05:07:43,340 --> 05:07:47,580
All right, cool. Let me let me have one. Ooh, that's pretty fresh. That tastes really good

4440
05:07:48,220 --> 05:07:53,419
Okay, wait, but what's up? You got a spicy tuna roll there. Oh, no. Yeah, i'll take one. That's raw. That's gross

4441
05:07:53,500 --> 05:07:55,500
I'm gonna eat like raw fish

4442
05:07:55,740 --> 05:07:58,540
It tastes good. I can't cook a pork and you can eat raw fish

4443
05:08:00,669 --> 05:08:02,700
um

4444
05:08:02,700 --> 05:08:08,619
If you it's not about the foodborne illnesses that you can get from sushi as long as it's prepared correctly

4445
05:08:10,360 --> 05:08:12,400
It's yeah, you can

4446
05:08:12,400 --> 05:08:16,560
But the difference that you and you trust the sushi guy you go to at the mini mall

4447
05:08:17,819 --> 05:08:21,099
I'm not going to a mini mall to get sushi. Where did you get that from?

4448
05:08:22,459 --> 05:08:24,459
a mini mall

4449
05:08:24,540 --> 05:08:26,220
the fucking

4450
05:08:26,220 --> 05:08:28,220
the uh gas station

4451
05:08:28,700 --> 05:08:30,299
No, i'm not

4452
05:08:30,299 --> 05:08:32,240
Okay

4453
05:08:32,240 --> 05:08:37,759
I know that there are people that say hey do not do not dog. Oh my again. Oh

4454
05:08:38,639 --> 05:08:40,880
My vorus my least favorite enemy

4455
05:08:42,560 --> 05:08:44,560
I'm stir

4456
05:08:48,189 --> 05:08:52,029
Yeah, look who's on the ground gift shit, oh having a good time down there

4457
05:08:52,669 --> 05:08:55,470
Are you?

4458
05:08:55,470 --> 05:08:57,310
Looks like someone's trying to kill you

4459
05:08:57,310 --> 05:09:01,240
I'm alive. Don't worry

4460
05:09:01,240 --> 05:09:02,919
Hey worry about yourself

4461
05:09:02,919 --> 05:09:11,290
Okay, i'm gonna go over here and worry about myself then I thought we were a team

4462
05:09:15,930 --> 05:09:17,930
Uh, but sushi

4463
05:09:19,130 --> 05:09:21,689
What sushi no, I said, but sushi

4464
05:09:23,150 --> 05:09:25,740
It's good

4465
05:09:25,740 --> 05:09:29,740
It's good, but I have to really really be in the mood. I'm only gonna have a few pieces

4466
05:09:30,380 --> 05:09:34,220
I know some people that are like, oh, yeah, like give me like five different roles. I'm gonna eat all of it

4467
05:09:34,540 --> 05:09:37,020
No, i'll have some not that much

4468
05:09:56,830 --> 05:09:58,830
Really like to hit you with that but whatever

4469
05:09:59,549 --> 05:10:08,860
Oh my goodness

4470
05:10:08,860 --> 05:10:10,860
He was targeting you with that at first

4471
05:10:12,040 --> 05:10:13,159
He did

4472
05:10:13,159 --> 05:10:15,240
You hit me with the first two. This is so

4473
05:10:16,740 --> 05:10:20,759
Unsatisfying to not be able to keep hold right now. You have no idea

4474
05:10:22,009 --> 05:10:27,389
I just want to keep hold

4475
05:10:27,389 --> 05:10:29,389
You say keep pulse one more time

4476
05:10:29,950 --> 05:10:31,950
And I swear i'm going to

4477
05:10:32,569 --> 05:10:35,450
Leave this fight

4478
05:10:35,450 --> 05:10:36,729
Who needs you?

4479
05:10:36,729 --> 05:10:40,569
Oh looks like somebody got hit there, right?

4480
05:10:41,209 --> 05:10:44,729
Looks like somebody. Oh somebody got hit twice. Oh, I wonder if you're gonna get hurt time

4481
05:10:44,810 --> 05:10:49,209
Maybe three stars third time to charm out. No, look at you. Look out for that. Hey watch out

4482
05:10:49,450 --> 05:10:51,659
He's coming in again

4483
05:10:51,659 --> 05:10:55,580
Don't worry star. Don't worry buddy. I'll beat the boss for us. Don't worry

4484
05:10:56,299 --> 05:11:54,680
I'll be back

4485
05:11:54,680 --> 05:12:11,720
You so badly want me to lose so you can scream at me. I can feel it. I can feel you just going like

4486
05:12:42,619 --> 05:13:13,389
Boy, i'd like my 20 in ones, please you beat it. Is he still here?

4487
05:13:14,110 --> 05:13:19,240
Have you beat it? I beat it. Okay, cool

4488
05:13:24,490 --> 05:13:36,360
I have one in the bathroom. I'm feeling so good. All right, let's go. Oh, I got 80

4489
05:13:37,000 --> 05:13:41,520
Pick up your souls. That's 80 000. All right

4490
05:13:42,000 --> 05:13:48,700
I was talking to you the whole time too. Did you bring your headphones to the bathroom? I mine are wired

4491
05:13:49,659 --> 05:13:54,939
I don't want the government fucking listening into my gamer talk. I was talking so much shit, dude. It was

4492
05:13:55,900 --> 05:13:59,099
I was like, oh, yeah, what about this? What about that? You were just gone you left

4493
05:14:00,029 --> 05:14:06,830
Yep, you know that goes with the uh, the good old saying how do you get bullied on the internet?

4494
05:14:06,830 --> 05:14:09,549
Just fucking turn the monitor off. I didn't even know

4495
05:14:11,840 --> 05:14:14,000
You were just talking. I actually was talking to nobody

4496
05:14:14,720 --> 05:14:16,720
I wasn't even talking to chat. I was just like

4497
05:14:17,279 --> 05:14:19,279
I feel like that means I win

4498
05:14:19,900 --> 05:14:22,569
It kind of does mean that

4499
05:14:22,569 --> 05:14:24,009
Yeah

4500
05:14:24,009 --> 05:14:26,959
No, that's all right. I still beat the boss

4501
05:14:27,599 --> 05:14:30,159
It's called a uh, that's called a parry reversal

4502
05:14:30,880 --> 05:14:33,930
Do we need a great rune to do this?

4503
05:14:33,930 --> 05:14:35,930
You cannot proceed without more great runes

4504
05:14:36,729 --> 05:14:37,770
Oh

4505
05:14:37,770 --> 05:14:40,810
I'm doing plus one more great rune. Do we actually need more?

4506
05:14:41,610 --> 05:14:45,930
Yeah, I believe we need two

4507
05:14:45,930 --> 05:14:47,450
We both have one

4508
05:14:47,450 --> 05:14:49,529
Can you drop them?

4509
05:14:49,610 --> 05:14:53,689
And just the same one I just I got the same one you did the unborn

4510
05:14:55,880 --> 05:14:57,259
Yeah

4511
05:14:57,259 --> 05:15:04,349
Okay again, I think we actually have to go back to millennia unless we could go

4512
05:15:07,040 --> 05:15:09,209
Where could we go?

4513
05:15:13,229 --> 05:15:15,310
What about k-lid is there anything in k-lid we could do

4514
05:15:18,590 --> 05:15:22,360
oh just random like tomes and tombs and

4515
05:15:23,560 --> 05:15:26,759
It's just random, right?

4516
05:15:27,000 --> 05:15:31,159
It has seemed like this run is weighted a little bit to drop better stuff at more important bosses

4517
05:15:31,400 --> 05:15:33,799
Oh, that's right. They're a tree. Let's do the ear tree

4518
05:15:36,459 --> 05:15:39,360
the

4519
05:15:39,360 --> 05:15:41,360
One tree the one that's right here

4520
05:15:42,080 --> 05:15:46,880
Okay. Hmm

4521
05:15:46,880 --> 05:15:50,599
the ronnie quest

4522
05:15:50,599 --> 05:15:52,599
Also, I have like all the ronnie items

4523
05:15:54,240 --> 05:15:57,840
We could have a little doll ronnie. I have the finger blade. I have

4524
05:15:58,799 --> 05:16:01,759
The servetus helmet. I i've got so much shit from it

4525
05:16:02,860 --> 05:16:03,419
I don't know

4526
05:16:03,419 --> 05:16:08,619
I don't know where it's used when it's used why it's used or what the fuck she's talking about and why she wants the world

4527
05:16:08,619 --> 05:16:11,180
To be in darkness, but I am there for it

4528
05:16:16,619 --> 05:16:23,790
Um, I feel like every few months I try to remind myself exactly what the hell is going on in this game

4529
05:16:24,590 --> 05:16:28,110
And I always just kind of get stuck again where I go. Wait, what actually the fuck is happening?

4530
05:16:29,819 --> 05:16:34,060
And then I watch uh baddie videos like three hours and then I go. Oh, that's right

4531
05:16:34,060 --> 05:16:36,540
I know everything and then I forget all of it in like a week

4532
05:16:37,790 --> 05:16:43,310
Uh, all right. So yeah, that was never a boss down here. It was just I guess technically it's just this group

4533
05:16:43,950 --> 05:16:45,950
And the stuff in the

4534
05:16:59,840 --> 05:17:01,900
And

4535
05:17:01,900 --> 05:17:03,659
alo scythe

4536
05:17:03,659 --> 05:17:05,520
That's a good item

4537
05:17:05,520 --> 05:17:07,520
carrion glint blade staff

4538
05:17:09,400 --> 05:17:12,060
Oh, I found a faith talisman

4539
05:17:15,209 --> 05:17:20,580
Plus 10 mine i'm not doing it again. Oh, no, this is potency of incantations

4540
05:17:21,119 --> 05:17:27,500
I think that actually that i'll take that i'll take that I can't I don't think I can drop this

4541
05:17:28,959 --> 05:17:32,000
All right. I don't think you can drop these drop it drop it

4542
05:17:33,180 --> 05:17:36,119
Drop it drop it

4543
05:17:38,110 --> 05:17:39,580
I can

4544
05:17:39,580 --> 05:17:42,270
You're welcome

4545
05:17:44,840 --> 05:17:57,479
Ooh, whoo. Who's gonna wear this I think

4546
05:17:58,360 --> 05:18:04,009
This is how I already had one. I already had one and it wasn't equipped

4547
05:18:07,159 --> 05:18:11,099
Nice. Oh, isn't there a cave like right here? I think there is

4548
05:18:13,500 --> 05:18:34,380
It is somewhere here, where is it check the cookbook recipes

4549
05:18:35,180 --> 05:18:39,419
Yeah, but we can't craft anything without the crafting item the thing that you get in the first minute

4550
05:18:39,819 --> 05:18:42,540
Crafting item they don't seem random. They all seem the same

4551
05:18:46,240 --> 05:18:52,319
It seemed like the uh, the first guy at the church of ella was selling the crafting thing no matter what really

4552
05:18:53,880 --> 05:18:57,659
Yeah, I bought it from him

4553
05:18:57,659 --> 05:19:01,259
I have a voodoo doll of you. What should I do? Um, can you just like I don't know

4554
05:19:01,740 --> 05:19:06,220
Put it in front of like the air conditioner on like, you know, like 70 degrees and just let me just chill there

4555
05:19:06,779 --> 05:19:12,000
Come on, man. What are you thinking? Oh, it's a view. I don't get one

4556
05:19:12,700 --> 05:19:14,250
typical

4557
05:19:14,250 --> 05:19:16,250
Just make speaking of him instead

4558
05:19:16,650 --> 05:19:20,090
Okay, can you open up my voodoo doll and like see if there's anything in like the stomach?

4559
05:19:20,330 --> 05:19:24,090
Yeah, can just like yeah open up the summer part. See if there's any worms in there

4560
05:19:25,290 --> 05:19:29,439
but like carefully

4561
05:19:29,439 --> 05:19:33,979
Ow you popped your pimple you

4562
05:19:36,599 --> 05:19:49,040
Say it that dog is very angry

4563
05:19:54,319 --> 05:19:56,400
We uh, I mentioned this before all right story

4564
05:19:56,400 --> 05:19:59,919
So if somebody was casting like negative magical spells against me

4565
05:20:00,319 --> 05:20:05,360
But there were other people casting positive magical spells against me. They kind of just run into each other, right?

4566
05:20:09,130 --> 05:20:14,250
They run into each other like it's I mean if somebody's doing like magical spells to make me feel bad

4567
05:20:14,250 --> 05:20:16,810
But people are also casting magical spells to make me feel good

4568
05:20:17,610 --> 05:20:20,909
Wouldn't it just be the answer? The answer is very obviously

4569
05:20:21,529 --> 05:20:27,209
There's gonna be 99 dudes casting positive vibes on you and the one dude's gonna cast negative and that's gonna be like a critical

4570
05:20:28,169 --> 05:20:30,169
No, I don't think so

4571
05:20:37,659 --> 05:20:45,799
Ooh, that's good. I have so many comments azor

4572
05:20:48,040 --> 05:20:50,360
Those are thing i'm faith now that dude

4573
05:20:52,119 --> 05:20:57,840
Give it up. Give it up. This is the comment of the year so far. We are describing

4574
05:20:58,619 --> 05:21:00,959
YouTube comments

4575
05:21:00,959 --> 05:21:07,580
Yeah, that's what that's what I thought it was like in reference to no, what do you mean?

4576
05:21:08,139 --> 05:21:13,500
I thought you were doing like a like my twitch chat like sends posi vibes and some people send no no no no

4577
05:21:13,580 --> 05:21:15,580
I'm talking about like actually casting spells

4578
05:21:16,139 --> 05:21:19,900
Oh, well, like what kind of spells are they are they pagan rituals? I don't know

4579
05:21:20,720 --> 05:21:22,720
Uh, are they a cult? Um

4580
05:21:23,200 --> 05:21:27,180
Something else demonic in nature. I could help you with this

4581
05:21:27,740 --> 05:21:31,360
But I need to know specifics

4582
05:21:31,360 --> 05:21:36,700
So what what should I like wear to like get the negative spells away again?

4583
05:21:36,700 --> 05:21:40,619
It depends what kind of spells they are just like okay, let's general like

4584
05:21:44,240 --> 05:21:49,580
General negative spells what you should you should wear. Um garlic

4585
05:21:50,360 --> 05:22:04,840
Uh, i'm gonna say old navy. All right wear of ruin of protection. Yeah, the the infamous curse this

4586
05:22:06,040 --> 05:22:09,500
Penis curse

4587
05:22:09,580 --> 05:22:13,529
I remember

4588
05:22:13,529 --> 05:22:17,319
I was pleading with chat to have the whatever

4589
05:22:18,439 --> 05:22:20,799
pleading with god

4590
05:22:20,799 --> 05:22:27,259
Take it back. It's so small. Why didn't you just make me a woman?

4591
05:22:29,720 --> 05:22:33,950
Do you do you ever hear that story when I was getting cursed? No

4592
05:22:35,979 --> 05:22:40,439
Somebody somebody somebody came into the chat and they were like, hey dude

4593
05:22:40,439 --> 05:22:45,000
I'm like casting a small penis curse against you and I was like, well, all right, somebody's cast want to make it bigger

4594
05:22:47,020 --> 05:22:52,430
It's all is that what this is trying to see if it's like evening out and I was like

4595
05:22:54,029 --> 05:22:58,750
But then I was like wait half of you shouldn't half of you do want because what if it goes too far

4596
05:22:59,709 --> 05:23:02,029
What if they're like, oh we all have to do this because we have to help him

4597
05:23:02,669 --> 05:23:08,919
That would be bad

4598
05:23:08,919 --> 05:23:14,459
Uh, I don't know if I can help you with this

4599
05:23:16,000 --> 05:23:19,439
Just sounds like this just sounds rough rough situation to be in

4600
05:23:28,810 --> 05:23:37,659
Any like updates on how it's been going? I'm just saying what spells they're casting at me

4601
05:23:42,220 --> 05:23:43,740
All right, are we?

4602
05:23:43,740 --> 05:23:45,500
are we

4603
05:23:45,500 --> 05:23:48,700
You can like open up my character sheet and see what like I have against me right now

4604
05:23:55,680 --> 05:24:00,000
I don't like this slob

4605
05:24:00,000 --> 05:24:02,000
I don't think this one has very much health

4606
05:24:05,180 --> 05:24:09,500
Does not

4607
05:24:09,500 --> 05:24:12,459
You would think I was getting hit less if my character didn't scream so loud

4608
05:24:14,080 --> 05:24:15,680
Actually kind of true

4609
05:24:15,680 --> 05:24:18,909
Like why doesn't your character like scream at all?

4610
05:24:21,799 --> 05:24:28,200
And my character is like a 13 syllable scream. I think my character does just not as loud

4611
05:24:29,159 --> 05:24:45,599
Well, all right, so we need to figure out what the hell we're gonna do here

4612
05:24:46,080 --> 05:24:50,080
I'm just following you thinking about I don't know if I could help you with this curse situation

4613
05:24:50,880 --> 05:24:59,880
We need another great rune

4614
05:25:00,840 --> 05:25:07,130
But doing even doing ronnie's quest will not give it to us because it's probably gonna be a random item

4615
05:25:07,770 --> 05:25:10,009
We need to just find random shit

4616
05:25:12,040 --> 05:25:17,639
Hey, dude, are you gonna shove an entire remembrance up your ass? Uh

4617
05:25:25,369 --> 05:25:29,209
I don't want to give that meme any more attention that I already have but like that was

4618
05:25:29,849 --> 05:25:32,569
But like that was like humorous enough for me to read it

4619
05:25:34,110 --> 05:25:36,110
All right. What about we go in this cave?

4620
05:25:37,849 --> 05:25:41,290
Anything for you in my leash? All right teleport to the outer wall phantom tree

4621
05:25:47,560 --> 05:25:59,340
You've already voted to warp to this destination and we can kill we could try milania again

4622
05:25:59,419 --> 05:26:01,419
But I feel like that's gonna give us

4623
05:26:01,419 --> 05:26:03,419
both headaches

4624
05:26:03,500 --> 05:26:08,840
Um

4625
05:26:08,840 --> 05:26:23,340
I'll heal you. Okay rewarp. Try it again

4626
05:26:40,029 --> 05:26:51,310
Bye hints. I'm not gonna cast any spells, but instead i'm praying for your salvation and hopes our lovely lord above will forgive you

4627
05:26:51,950 --> 05:26:54,509
And well, I appreciate that though like that's

4628
05:26:55,709 --> 05:26:57,709
That that that should help right?

4629
05:27:00,080 --> 05:27:01,439
I wasn't listening

4630
05:27:01,439 --> 05:27:03,439
No, thanks. Thank you

4631
05:27:03,759 --> 05:27:07,020
All right

4632
05:27:07,020 --> 05:27:09,020
All right. So from here we're going down

4633
05:27:09,419 --> 05:27:11,500
To this cave just because I feel like going

4634
05:27:13,319 --> 05:27:15,319
Hey, hey, buddy. Hey

4635
05:27:15,720 --> 05:27:16,599
Yeah

4636
05:27:16,599 --> 05:27:20,619
For the guild for the guild

4637
05:27:24,700 --> 05:27:27,979
I got the flame of frenzy. I could do it if I wanted to

4638
05:27:30,810 --> 05:27:32,409
I have enough faith

4639
05:27:32,409 --> 05:27:34,509
Get three finger me

4640
05:27:34,509 --> 05:27:35,790
I could

4641
05:27:35,790 --> 05:27:45,180
We gotta go down there

4642
05:27:45,740 --> 05:27:47,740
Don't jump. It's gonna get you hurt

4643
05:28:08,000 --> 05:28:10,000
What do you think about uh

4644
05:28:10,240 --> 05:28:12,279
Go to milania. No

4645
05:28:12,279 --> 05:28:13,959
Do you know what I think?

4646
05:28:13,959 --> 05:28:16,840
And I don't think I ever saw this in like an elden ring video

4647
05:28:16,919 --> 05:28:20,279
But it always it's always the thing that's like, huh that has me thinking

4648
05:28:20,840 --> 05:28:22,840
Yeah, is that the uh

4649
05:28:23,000 --> 05:28:26,360
So the giants don't have heads because their faces are in their bodies

4650
05:28:28,080 --> 05:28:32,409
You're dead. How did you die? I don't I honestly don't even fucking know what happened

4651
05:28:33,130 --> 05:28:36,319
I guess I just got

4652
05:28:36,319 --> 05:28:38,319
Electrocuted like over on I don't know

4653
05:28:38,400 --> 05:28:49,310
Okay. Hey, welcome back. You're talking about giants. Yeah, so the giants don't have heads their faces are inside their stomachs

4654
05:28:49,869 --> 05:28:53,630
Okay, and then I I also had like this weird thought I was like, okay

4655
05:28:53,630 --> 05:28:56,590
Well, what if their brains in a different spot and their brain is in their hands?

4656
05:28:57,229 --> 05:28:59,950
That's why when you hurt the giant's hands, that's this weak spot

4657
05:29:00,909 --> 05:29:04,990
Because like the three fingers and the two fingers is obviously like it's like a giant sized hand

4658
05:29:05,069 --> 05:29:07,150
I was like dude, what if these are just like giant brains?

4659
05:29:07,950 --> 05:29:11,849
They do have that they do have heads

4660
05:29:15,470 --> 05:29:18,590
Uh, I mean the two fingers and the three fingers obviously a part of the same hand

4661
05:29:19,150 --> 05:29:21,150
I think that's you could probably argue that

4662
05:29:21,869 --> 05:29:25,950
Uh part of the same hand that maybe split up and oh we have two different

4663
05:29:26,750 --> 05:29:32,729
Philosophies or something. I don't know the whole hand. Maybe the dlc will put the hand together possibly

4664
05:29:33,290 --> 05:29:38,810
Maybe there'll be other full hands hands are a big thing in this game the hand enemies and stuff

4665
05:29:39,290 --> 05:29:43,360
There are other two fingers, but that they're probably maybe the other three fingers

4666
05:29:44,319 --> 05:29:49,680
They were probably all i'm just saying normally enemies weak points is like hit the enemy in the head

4667
05:29:49,919 --> 05:29:52,240
But the giant is like oh shit hit his hand

4668
05:29:52,799 --> 05:29:54,799
Hey, easy shield enemy. Oh head

4669
05:29:55,790 --> 05:29:57,790
I've got a special special enemy down here

4670
05:30:15,759 --> 05:30:17,759
What's your favorite haichu flavor

4671
05:30:19,209 --> 05:30:21,369
My favorite haichu haichu

4672
05:30:22,330 --> 05:30:29,340
Flavor the fuck are you saying? What is your favorite haichu flavor?

4673
05:30:30,139 --> 05:30:33,080
Can I get an example?

4674
05:30:33,080 --> 05:30:36,439
You just okay. So the the answer to the question is i've never eaten one of these before

4675
05:30:36,840 --> 05:30:46,700
Like haichu like you're sneezing like my favorite sneeze mine's mango. I like peach

4676
05:30:52,240 --> 05:30:53,599
Haichus suck

4677
05:30:53,599 --> 05:31:00,400
What do you know? They don't height to me and I gotta i'm a big fan of this company

4678
05:31:00,400 --> 05:31:08,009
I'm a big fan of these but haichus are if starburst gave a shit you come down here

4679
05:31:08,880 --> 05:31:22,919
I'm just saying and I love starburst. I love to go to anime conventions and eat pocky

4680
05:31:24,250 --> 05:31:30,490
Those are good strawberry, uh strawberry and cherry

4681
05:31:31,439 --> 05:31:33,799
uh starburst

4682
05:31:34,409 --> 05:31:36,409
Our our s plus

4683
05:31:36,490 --> 05:31:38,330
But i'm sorry

4684
05:31:38,330 --> 05:31:40,330
I feel like they haven't innovated in the game at all

4685
05:31:46,250 --> 05:31:49,689
The classics need to innovate. Well, hold on a minute. Look, what about what about rices?

4686
05:31:50,330 --> 05:31:55,130
Look at all the different rices there are there's so many different innovative new rices and they're actually pretty good are there

4687
05:31:55,450 --> 05:31:59,049
Oh, yeah, i've never seen one think of all the innovations that have happened in rices

4688
05:32:00,279 --> 05:32:01,880
like what

4689
05:32:01,880 --> 05:32:06,360
Peanut butter rices that's that's a big skeleton rices thins

4690
05:32:07,720 --> 05:32:10,900
That is a huge skeleton. Let me see if he's paying attention

4691
05:32:12,889 --> 05:32:14,240
Hey

4692
05:32:14,240 --> 05:32:18,650
Hey, who did that?

4693
05:32:18,650 --> 05:32:20,970
Okay, how come he doesn't lack the whole game?

4694
05:32:21,770 --> 05:32:23,770
What the birds do? Um

4695
05:32:24,009 --> 05:32:28,040
We need to get out of here

4696
05:32:28,040 --> 05:32:30,650
Who fucking hit him?

4697
05:32:30,650 --> 05:32:32,729
I don't think we fight this. I think we just go

4698
05:32:42,729 --> 05:32:44,729
One little bone

4699
05:32:44,970 --> 05:32:46,810
on the tree branch

4700
05:32:46,810 --> 05:32:47,930
Let's go

4701
05:32:47,930 --> 05:32:55,709
Do you know what else is really interesting about elden ring lore never hear anyone talk about this? Sure

4702
05:32:56,029 --> 05:33:00,270
You know a lot of people pronounce the word three and they can't speak english. They say tree

4703
05:33:01,310 --> 05:33:06,430
So anything it's interesting they have the tree fingers and how important the uh, the urn tree is

4704
05:33:11,930 --> 05:33:14,169
Wait, did you go say that again? I just I

4705
05:33:16,029 --> 05:33:20,060
You you say

4706
05:33:20,060 --> 05:33:27,310
What tree?

4707
05:33:27,310 --> 05:33:29,709
Don't worry about it. It's kind of above your pay grade

4708
05:33:37,259 --> 05:33:39,259
Um, but okay, but what about gideon?

4709
05:33:40,540 --> 05:33:44,939
What about him if gideon said three fingers he'd go. Oh, you've probably seen the tree fingers

4710
05:33:46,299 --> 05:33:49,709
What are you talking about? Well, not everyone pronounces it that way

4711
05:33:55,770 --> 05:34:00,250
Like some say cost some say cost cost some say cost

4712
05:34:01,049 --> 05:34:05,290
Grand does eyes grand does eyes people say three and some people say tree

4713
05:34:06,169 --> 05:34:08,569
Like you once did for the vacuous rom

4714
05:34:10,509 --> 05:34:12,509
the oh

4715
05:34:12,750 --> 05:34:19,290
Knowing armor

4716
05:34:19,290 --> 05:34:24,520
Okay, we need to go through

4717
05:34:24,520 --> 05:34:27,279
Got him. I did so much damage

4718
05:34:27,759 --> 05:34:30,319
Why don't we just do the thing just drop down and kill him from the top?

4719
05:34:30,880 --> 05:34:35,290
This is like the easiest way to kill these

4720
05:34:36,080 --> 05:34:37,360
Do it then

4721
05:34:37,360 --> 05:34:40,400
Can you like move him a little bit towards you like aggro me over?

4722
05:34:40,479 --> 05:34:42,720
Hey, did you know if you hit the top of it? Yeah

4723
05:34:44,990 --> 05:34:46,509
Just pull them this way

4724
05:34:46,509 --> 05:34:50,270
I'll get him i'm stuck on this ant. Why do you look like a half-cooked hot dog?

4725
05:34:50,830 --> 05:34:53,709
Um, I don't know bro fucking fuck off

4726
05:34:55,130 --> 05:35:04,970
Whoa

4727
05:35:04,970 --> 05:35:07,849
I got him. Oh i'm doing so much damage

4728
05:35:11,450 --> 05:35:14,569
Hey, hey, hey group up guilty guilty group up

4729
05:35:21,659 --> 05:35:26,459
Good always gonna make sure you that you can be prepared for anything. So that means you're pretty good healer

4730
05:35:27,599 --> 05:35:32,380
Yeah, okay. So we got a

4731
05:35:32,380 --> 05:35:34,380
Is there another wall shadow priest?

4732
05:35:34,779 --> 05:35:38,700
There's another wall somewhere, right? There's gotta be another wall. There's always another wall

4733
05:35:44,000 --> 05:36:03,599
Found it

4734
05:36:03,599 --> 05:36:05,439
Watch out slugman

4735
05:36:05,439 --> 05:36:15,659
Oh, isn't this where the big ass little thing is?

4736
05:36:16,220 --> 05:36:19,580
This one here isn't this uh, isn't this the well in dark souls, too?

4737
05:36:21,819 --> 05:36:24,459
uh

4738
05:36:24,459 --> 05:36:29,099
No, I would make this more aligned with the um, the big tree in dark souls one

4739
05:36:31,919 --> 05:36:40,970
The big tree the tree what's it called? Yeah, no great great something great the big tree

4740
05:36:41,529 --> 05:36:46,319
Yeah, I missed that area. No, you didn't i've like watched you play it

4741
05:36:47,279 --> 05:36:52,400
I act the the like those like secret tree area. That's like it's not even secret way off to the side

4742
05:36:52,479 --> 05:36:56,799
I I played and saw dark souls one so many times before I realized that area existed. I'm like

4743
05:36:57,439 --> 05:36:59,439
I'm telling you i'm a fraud

4744
05:36:59,680 --> 05:37:01,200
I think you just

4745
05:37:01,279 --> 05:37:04,880
Want to beat stuff so quickly that you just don't care if you miss something

4746
05:37:04,880 --> 05:37:13,880
No, it's not you're you're misrepresenting me right now. I could take you to court. Yeah, but what would you even what would you sue me for?

4747
05:37:15,700 --> 05:37:29,040
Defamation watch out big guy in here. This is the isn't this the right? This is the same

4748
05:37:29,040 --> 05:37:31,040
This is the correct enemy that's supposed to be in here

4749
05:37:31,639 --> 05:37:32,860
Is it?

4750
05:37:32,860 --> 05:37:37,720
I think so

4751
05:37:37,720 --> 05:37:55,560
I'm pretty sure this is what's actually in here. I thought he was gonna kill me in one hit

4752
05:37:56,360 --> 05:38:03,049
He's got so much lighting on him. It's hard to see where he is

4753
05:38:15,389 --> 05:38:16,509
Nice

4754
05:38:16,509 --> 05:38:20,220
I got the glaive of gilgamesh

4755
05:38:20,700 --> 05:38:22,880
I got the seedbed curse

4756
05:38:22,959 --> 05:38:24,400
Stay away from me

4757
05:38:24,400 --> 05:38:29,200
Ah, I got a remembrance actually did you really that's good. You know the omen king

4758
05:38:31,099 --> 05:38:33,659
You know him, you know who that is the omen king

4759
05:38:34,939 --> 05:38:37,310
Uh, is that bog?

4760
05:38:37,310 --> 05:38:39,310
Or is that margott?

4761
05:38:41,130 --> 05:38:43,529
You really you need to go watch three more hours of videos

4762
05:38:45,520 --> 05:38:48,400
I believe you're talking about morgott

4763
05:38:48,959 --> 05:38:51,680
I feel like i'm hitting you with lore that you never even considered before

4764
05:38:52,159 --> 05:38:56,080
And you're just you don't even remember like anything. No, I i'm telling you

4765
05:38:56,479 --> 05:39:01,200
I was obsessed with all this game's lore everything about it. I just loved every second of it

4766
05:39:05,400 --> 05:39:07,470
You got me wrong

4767
05:39:07,470 --> 05:39:09,790
And you never even considered it was the tree fingers

4768
05:39:12,700 --> 05:39:37,520
Okay, just go do double get double teach and kill millennia enough to level up. Okay. Well, this one doesn't open yet. All right, so

4769
05:39:38,560 --> 05:39:43,310
That's how we get to here

4770
05:39:43,310 --> 05:39:45,639
This thing doesn't open yet

4771
05:39:45,639 --> 05:39:47,639
We can't get into the capital

4772
05:39:49,500 --> 05:39:52,979
We can't we have to beat millennia

4773
05:39:56,200 --> 05:39:58,200
We have to

4774
05:40:02,700 --> 05:40:06,299
I mean, I guess I think we're kind of have to just I think we have to kill millennia

4775
05:40:06,619 --> 05:40:11,900
I think we gotta kill millennia unless we just did random like catacombs and stuff to try to find a run

4776
05:40:13,000 --> 05:40:15,000
Uh, what's um

4777
05:40:15,240 --> 05:40:21,310
You know the whole like upside down tower ronnie's quest thing thing. Yeah, I I have the device

4778
05:40:21,790 --> 05:40:24,830
You want to go to it we kept saying we have all the ronnie shit and the finger blade

4779
05:40:26,040 --> 05:40:31,479
All right, i'm mark to ronnie. Yeah ranala or remi. All right, what does she want me to call her?

4780
05:40:31,959 --> 05:40:44,409
Uh, let's go to ronnie's rise. Yeah, is she even there? Do we have to talk to servetus man?

4781
05:40:46,619 --> 05:40:53,240
Um, I don't does she move because she goes to sleep forever and she's just totally just like this part of the game's boring

4782
05:40:53,240 --> 05:41:06,939
Wake me up when it's over. I don't know. Yeah

4783
05:41:07,900 --> 05:41:14,080
Uh, can we do that funny thing that we did before where we pitch our voice down one tiny notch

4784
05:41:15,119 --> 05:41:17,759
Keep it on permanently until like people just leave

4785
05:41:18,560 --> 05:41:28,319
Yeah, uh sounds pretty good. Okay. I think you're pitched a little bit too a little a little too low

4786
05:41:28,639 --> 05:41:30,939
Yeah, a little higher than that. Um

4787
05:41:31,419 --> 05:41:45,049
Uh a little higher no lower. I mean then it's not on at all. Okay, so I I can do something

4788
05:41:46,009 --> 05:41:50,080
Wait, oh, I don't I don't want to do that. I almost just ruined our whole playthrough

4789
05:41:50,990 --> 05:41:53,869
Did you just like hit her in the head with a sword? No, I almost just did the

4790
05:41:54,750 --> 05:42:00,919
Weird quest thingy where like isn't that I don't got administered drought. What's that?

4791
05:42:03,020 --> 05:42:07,560
Like you give her like a fucking poison. I yeah, I think I could like kill her or something. Okay

4792
05:42:07,560 --> 05:42:18,479
I'm not going over there. Okay. She uh, do we get on stairs and blade is like you took my waifu and we kill him

4793
05:42:18,720 --> 05:42:22,189
I think it happens later

4794
05:42:22,189 --> 05:42:48,360
I think that happens after you burn the tree and I can we get your best like wolf snarl

4795
05:42:48,680 --> 05:43:00,680
That was a bird but it was a decent attempt. All right. What what did she say?

4796
05:43:02,360 --> 05:43:06,599
Uh, she says she also has to go on a journey and she I think she gives you the doll

4797
05:43:06,759 --> 05:43:11,000
I think we gotta go talk to the other tower guy. Don't we have to talk to the doll at a certain place?

4798
05:43:11,560 --> 05:43:13,659
underground somewhere

4799
05:43:13,659 --> 05:43:22,009
Uh, yeah the other like nocturn sit dude. This quest is so fucked. What do we have to do for like why are we doing this?

4800
05:43:22,169 --> 05:43:24,169
Why did I bring this up again?

4801
05:43:25,069 --> 05:43:40,029
We're trying to get a rune trying to engage in my interest. I was just he likes pretending to be like a wolf

4802
05:43:40,270 --> 05:43:47,259
We can't what if I give them like an easy one? It's probably the wrong one. There's another one, right?

4803
05:43:47,419 --> 05:43:50,360
Or is it there is the third tower?

4804
05:43:50,680 --> 05:43:58,330
Isn't that the one is the three tower sisters? Oh like the three fingers

4805
05:43:58,889 --> 05:44:00,009
Remember?

4806
05:44:00,009 --> 05:44:02,009
Yeah, I do the three fingers

4807
05:44:02,330 --> 05:44:08,040
Do you think there's any significance?

4808
05:44:08,040 --> 05:44:13,790
Um, I don't know. Do you want to like no clip and fly around this area for like 16 hours? Let's kill those dragons

4809
05:44:13,950 --> 05:44:28,080
Oh, here's here's the land six. Is that someone I should know? This is one of the other

4810
05:44:28,639 --> 05:44:36,009
Dragons that you fight secretly. Oh, who is this one of the other dragons?

4811
05:44:36,569 --> 05:44:39,520
This is the placid eucach's

4812
05:44:39,520 --> 05:44:44,759
I don't know. I don't I don't know. It's one of these like the blood. He's just one of the dragons

4813
05:45:10,270 --> 05:45:13,599
Jumping he he'd teleport it

4814
05:45:15,229 --> 05:45:29,799
To where I don't know. Is this like monster hunter? You got to go like find his next area

4815
05:45:30,200 --> 05:45:33,150
I mean the help are still on the screen

4816
05:45:33,389 --> 05:45:57,549
Oh shit, just got the urn tree great shield. I think he's gone

4817
05:46:00,939 --> 05:46:07,770
No, is he only here like at night time or something? They have like a day change make him go. Bye. Bye

4818
05:46:09,400 --> 05:46:10,919
He's about to respawn

4819
05:46:10,919 --> 05:46:12,919
Go to the entrance of the three sisters

4820
05:46:17,389 --> 05:46:18,750
I actually don't remember

4821
05:46:18,750 --> 05:46:27,369
Not over there

4822
05:46:27,369 --> 05:46:36,779
Butthead. Oh, I found the service man tower accept the task

4823
05:46:39,869 --> 05:46:42,990
He handed over the potion in question, which was three smithing stone

4824
05:46:43,630 --> 05:46:51,020
And then you need nefali to drink the potion. I actually have the potion. I think I have denied it

4825
05:46:52,279 --> 05:46:57,400
She was like, I don't want to drink that I'm I'm fucking gluten-free or whatever

4826
05:46:59,389 --> 05:47:01,389
Oh my god, he looks fucking

4827
05:47:02,639 --> 05:47:04,639

Okay, thanks for the golden rune, okay, I have that potion yeah

4829
05:47:31,450 --> 05:47:33,450

Explosive ghost flame

4832

Great rune really? No, I was gonna say come on. Why didn't I get none?

4836
05:48:38,759 --> 05:48:42,029
All right. Well now what?

4837
05:48:42,270 --> 05:48:46,189
Reload the area. I'm talking a pity. Um, I don't we don't gotta kill the dragon

4838
05:48:50,509 --> 05:49:06,680
Did you go down here did right? Did you go down? My minimap is my map is wrong, man

4839
05:49:09,240 --> 05:49:13,720
Oh, I think you're inside here. We can just teleport somewhere. I just wanted to see what he was selling

4840
05:49:20,990 --> 05:49:28,759
Why are you doing that? I ate this weird raw pork chop. I heat it up

4841
05:49:29,479 --> 05:49:31,560
Was there for like 16 hours?

4842
05:49:31,560 --> 05:49:33,720
Oh, haha. I figured it would be all right

4843
05:49:34,439 --> 05:49:37,319
Living my life story now

4844
05:49:37,319 --> 05:49:37,639
All right

4845
05:49:37,639 --> 05:49:42,360
We need to go somewhere and we need to figure out we need to get a another rune or we need to actually just go

4846
05:49:42,360 --> 05:49:44,360
Let's go kill. Let's go millennia. Let's go

4847
05:49:44,919 --> 05:49:47,159
Let's do it. Oh, he said let's go

4848
05:49:48,419 --> 05:49:50,419
Millennia, let's do it millennia

4849
05:49:51,930 --> 05:50:01,069
Where's the right bonfire? Let's go get millennia. Where's pidea? Am I in the right spot for pidea?

4850
05:50:01,549 --> 05:50:03,819
I was just kind of jumping around

4851
05:50:03,819 --> 05:50:06,060
No, you gotta like fall off the edge. There's like a

4852
05:50:07,229 --> 05:50:10,080
Castle. Yeah, somebody behind you

4853
05:50:10,159 --> 05:50:13,040
Behind here is right here. I know this item's

4854
05:50:14,459 --> 05:50:26,110
Behind one of these could be a great run behind I never found this person

4855
05:50:27,869 --> 05:50:33,049
Really? No. Wow. What a loser you are. I thought you played this game

4856
05:50:33,930 --> 05:50:44,220
Yeah, how does it feel? Pretty good

4857
05:51:02,270 --> 05:51:07,209
Dude i've never been down here. Holy shit

4858
05:51:12,060 --> 05:51:16,400
Cool. All right. Are you ready to fight?

4859
05:51:17,020 --> 05:51:21,119
Millennia and have us both rage quit the stream in about 30 minutes

4860
05:51:21,759 --> 05:51:28,779
I say that we um for the prediction. I think we could do it in like 60 tries

4861
05:51:29,900 --> 05:51:35,740
Do you have any runes? Yeah, I need 4 000

4862
05:51:39,279 --> 05:51:41,279
Hey you your runes

4863
05:51:42,000 --> 05:51:47,020
Give them to me. Yeah, it's kind of just like gold farming

4864
05:51:48,220 --> 05:52:05,310
You should be you should pretend to be mad at stir

4865
05:52:07,229 --> 05:52:12,520
He'll hear he doesn't pretend

4866
05:52:17,229 --> 05:52:21,229
All right. You ready to just kind of bang our heads against the wall for a little bit?

4867
05:52:23,849 --> 05:52:26,860
Okay, if we do it

4868
05:52:27,259 --> 05:52:29,979
We just I think we've been playing for a while. We warmed up a lot

4869
05:52:29,979 --> 05:52:33,099
I mean this was six hours in if we're gonna do it. We're gonna do it right now

4870
05:52:33,259 --> 05:52:35,259
I actually know how to dodge now

4871
05:52:35,419 --> 05:52:37,419
All right. So where is the good place to go to?

4872
05:52:39,049 --> 05:53:02,590
Uh, hey bro, did you forget the whole game too? Nice. Yep. I don't know. I feel like one of these

4873
05:53:03,229 --> 05:53:23,389
Yes tall

4874
05:53:23,389 --> 05:53:25,389
Will they beat millennia in 10 tries?

4875
05:53:26,169 --> 05:53:48,889
Hmm I that's possible. I wonder we'll see let me make sure I got the right gear on millennia is slash, right?

4876
05:53:53,180 --> 05:53:59,639
I believe law of regression heals all ailments that should get rid of scarlet rot in case we get you know bad pickle

4877
05:53:59,880 --> 05:54:19,200
Is all gonna be heavy

4878
05:54:19,200 --> 05:54:44,080
All right. So points are in we have 10 real attempts. Are you ready? Yep. All right, let's go soldiers for the guild

4879
05:54:45,740 --> 05:54:47,740
We've been trying to clear this raid for a month

4880
05:54:48,380 --> 05:54:50,380
We have the big guilds have already done it

4881
05:54:52,939 --> 05:54:57,900
We're the last ones. We're not trying to get world first or anything. We're just trying to just participate

4882
05:55:00,240 --> 05:55:03,799
They're out gearing us

4883
05:55:03,799 --> 05:55:07,959
Which is making making them they're getting more loot in the chinese new year event

4884
05:55:12,599 --> 05:55:14,599
They spent plenty of time developing

4885
05:55:15,000 --> 05:55:19,819
Okay, just to get dropped from china. All right. All right. All right. Are you ready? You're right

05:56:18,430 --> 05:56:27,520
She can go up anytime. Yeah

4893
05:56:27,919 --> 05:56:34,779
Oh

05:56:34,779 --> 05:56:37,040
Excellent. Good job. Excellent

4895
05:56:48,779 --> 05:56:54,860
My fucking button clicked in this stupid button the button clicked in and it's a crouch

05:56:57,240 --> 05:56:59,069
literally

4897
05:56:59,069 --> 05:57:00,189
the

4898
05:57:00,189 --> 05:57:02,349
worst place for a fucking crouch

4899
05:57:03,069 --> 05:57:22,080
I

4900
05:57:22,080 --> 05:57:27,360
Left stick push in his crouch. Do you know how much people grip this fucking game and they like, you know

4901
05:57:27,360 --> 05:57:35,209
How many times that happens?

4902
05:57:35,209 --> 05:57:37,369
Just just trying some stuff seeing how it goes

4903
05:57:38,669 --> 05:57:39,709
learning

4904
05:57:39,709 --> 05:57:42,680
Didn't you rebind it? Oh, yeah, this is a whole nother game client

4905
05:57:47,959 --> 05:57:49,319
not the

4906
05:57:49,319 --> 05:57:56,680
Original game client. Oh and I gotta go unbind crouch to the left stick

4907
05:57:57,240 --> 05:58:07,180
Do you ever have that problem?

4908
05:58:07,180 --> 05:58:14,439
No, where like you you're pushing down on like running around and you and you click in the left stick because you're pushing down hard

4909
05:58:15,450 --> 05:58:19,869
And this bullshit happens never done it. I've been there somebody says it

4910
05:58:20,860 --> 05:58:23,229
I believe that it's a thing

4911
05:58:23,229 --> 05:58:26,110
And what these controllers really need is a mind detector

4912
05:58:30,720 --> 05:58:36,250
We could just get a little bit closer to the user's intent. Hold on a second. This is all fucked up

4913
05:58:38,779 --> 05:58:42,159
Okay, that's better. I feel like switching to faith was a meme

4914
05:58:43,310 --> 05:58:49,159
Okay, i'm better

4915
05:58:49,159 --> 05:58:51,639
And I am objectively worse than our last fight

4916
05:58:52,680 --> 05:58:55,560
I don't think so. I think we're okay

4917
05:58:55,560 --> 05:58:57,080
You're doing pretty well

4918
05:58:57,080 --> 05:58:59,080
Until I press the fucking left stick in

4919
05:58:59,959 --> 05:59:10,459
You know, it kind of reminds me of when

4920
05:59:10,860 --> 05:59:12,060
hitting

4921
05:59:12,060 --> 05:59:13,680
uh

4922
05:59:13,680 --> 05:59:17,040
Light attack and forward was kick in some of the other games

4923
05:59:19,479 --> 05:59:33,180
Yeah, I did that quite a bit

4924
05:59:33,180 --> 05:59:34,779
in my personal opinion

4925
05:59:34,779 --> 05:59:36,779
Get anything bound off the movement button

4926
05:59:42,509 --> 05:59:47,950
Okay, that one was uh, it was a good attempt. Yeah, we're good. We're good a little bit of a controller issue didn't count

4927
05:59:48,669 --> 06:00:02,619
Oh, you would just go for the caster

4928
06:00:04,080 --> 06:00:09,680
Wow, that was my bad. I didn't even realize that at first that you changed targets. That was not a good attempt. All right

4929
06:00:11,720 --> 06:00:13,720
Dude, like glintstone pebble

4930
06:00:14,830 --> 06:00:16,509
It's the best spell in the game

4931
06:00:16,509 --> 06:00:21,279
What are you using now?

4932
06:00:21,279 --> 06:00:27,709
Now I got like lightning bolt and she can actually dodge it because it doesn't track at all. So glintstone pebble is

4933
06:00:28,880 --> 06:00:30,669
gone

4934
06:00:30,669 --> 06:00:33,610
Uh, well i'm faith skilled now

4935
06:00:34,169 --> 06:00:37,709
I distinctly remember us having an argument about this very subject

4936
06:00:38,509 --> 06:00:39,709
Did we?

4937
06:00:39,709 --> 06:00:41,150
edgar alan poe

4938
06:00:41,150 --> 06:00:43,770
I distinctly remember

4939
06:00:43,770 --> 06:00:44,970
us

4940
06:00:44,970 --> 06:00:47,049
Squabbling over this very very subject

4941
06:00:50,840 --> 06:00:52,840
He's disassociating

4942
06:00:53,240 --> 06:00:55,240
So that's a fight for Lydia

4943
06:01:02,939 --> 06:01:04,939
He thinks he's gonna play

4944
06:01:04,939 --> 06:01:13,500
Maybe it'll help did we I don't remember talking about it

4945
06:01:14,639 --> 06:01:16,400
Here I am hit me

4946
06:01:16,400 --> 06:01:24,720
Let us go up the elevator

4947
06:01:24,720 --> 06:01:26,720
Brother there's an arrow in your back

4948
06:01:27,360 --> 06:01:40,490
Hello millennium

4949
06:01:40,490 --> 06:01:49,119
I'm here

4950
06:01:49,119 --> 06:01:50,799
Excellent first maneuver

4951
06:01:50,799 --> 06:01:53,549
Although I seem to have dodged quite a few of them

4952
06:02:04,400 --> 06:02:12,380
Pressing the attack I see

4953
06:02:12,380 --> 06:02:17,069
That I didn't do it

4954
06:02:17,069 --> 06:02:20,430
Yeah

4955
06:02:20,430 --> 06:02:25,000
Yeah, you did

4956
06:02:25,000 --> 06:02:27,000
Yeah, it also did more damage

4957
06:02:27,240 --> 06:02:31,720
But what that buffered so hard

4958
06:02:46,040 --> 06:02:56,459
We do so much less damage now because it's because she's scaling no, is that what it is? No, she's scaled to

4959
06:02:57,419 --> 06:03:03,500
The room that she's in i'm just saying that my lightning deals less damage than my glintstone pebble did and it's harder to hit her with it

4960
06:03:04,299 --> 06:03:08,009
She's gonna dodge it every time

4961
06:03:12,080 --> 06:03:14,080
Unless she's a big dumb dumb

4962
06:03:18,860 --> 06:03:24,939
Let her get me

4963
06:03:24,939 --> 06:03:26,939
Be scaled to have lower health if anything

4964
06:03:37,049 --> 06:03:43,290
Phase two is is if phase one is giving us some trouble already phase two is gonna be such a pain in the ass

4965
06:03:44,990 --> 06:03:48,569
Um, I think i'm bad

4966
06:03:49,279 --> 06:03:54,799
Uh, and i've got 100 fizz mitigation shield was letting me just live through the uh, the flurry

4967
06:03:56,080 --> 06:03:58,639
So maybe I should put one on too

4968
06:03:58,880 --> 06:04:03,369
I figure even if she hurts me and she does heal from hitting you but like as long as I don't

4969
06:04:04,090 --> 06:04:07,119
Fucking insta die

4970
06:04:07,119 --> 06:04:09,119
I'm just gonna i'm just gonna sword no magic

4971
06:04:09,360 --> 06:04:14,159
I can use my greater heals. Actually, let me go back. Oh you already jumped. I mean, I thought I thought I was

4972
06:04:15,040 --> 06:04:16,400
Holding you up

4973
06:04:16,400 --> 06:04:21,840
I have a few magic flasks. You know what? You know what? Let's yeah, let's just reset it. Let's go. No, no, no

4974
06:04:22,000 --> 06:04:24,639
No, okay. Yeah, let's just let's just reset. Let's just reset

4975
06:04:25,119 --> 06:04:27,119
Reset it. I gotta move some gear around

4976
06:04:28,560 --> 06:04:30,560
That doesn't count. That doesn't that's not a real attempt

4977
06:04:33,119 --> 06:04:35,119
Yeah, our reset doesn't count. That's not fair

4978
06:04:38,169 --> 06:04:41,209
We have to traverse the fog door for it to be a real attempt

4979
06:04:42,169 --> 06:04:44,169
I called it before I jumped down

4980
06:04:45,689 --> 06:04:47,130
Sour boys

4981
06:04:47,130 --> 06:04:50,250
Because I have three fucking mana flasks. I don't need

4982
06:04:51,450 --> 06:04:57,450
How heavy is it?

4983
06:04:57,450 --> 06:04:58,970
It's way too heavy

4984
06:04:58,970 --> 06:05:18,909
I think I just had to be good

4985
06:05:18,909 --> 06:05:20,430
Okay, you ready?

4986
06:05:20,430 --> 06:05:31,200
I don't know how many weapons you've like considered using and how much stuff you've done and i'm seriously still like

4987
06:05:32,159 --> 06:05:34,159
How we just happened to work?

4988
06:05:34,880 --> 06:05:39,020
I don't know that did a lot of damage here. I'll use uh, I have the healings still equipped

4989
06:05:39,020 --> 06:05:44,810
I can use before the door

4990
06:05:44,810 --> 06:05:46,409
Yeah, don't heal yourself

4991
06:05:46,409 --> 06:05:49,709
I think the dog is

4992
06:05:49,709 --> 06:05:52,380
Right behind us

4993
06:05:52,380 --> 06:05:53,659
Thank god

4994
06:05:53,659 --> 06:06:00,139
Did that not get you?

4995
06:06:00,139 --> 06:06:02,540
I think it did I can't tell

4996
06:06:05,020 --> 06:06:07,819
dead

4997
06:06:07,819 --> 06:06:10,569
The other one was the lord's heal

4998
06:06:13,950 --> 06:06:18,509
Lord sworn

4999
06:06:18,509 --> 06:06:25,229
Okay

5000
06:06:25,229 --> 06:06:28,060
Okay

5001
06:06:28,060 --> 06:06:31,819
No disrespect to the battle mercies out there, but really let's go balls out

5002
06:06:34,680 --> 06:06:37,479
Don't waste all your stamina bar. She could go up at any time

5003
06:06:40,569 --> 06:06:48,779
Let's go

5004
06:06:48,779 --> 06:06:53,369
Hi

5005
06:06:53,369 --> 06:06:57,209
Fucking i'm

5006
06:07:26,240 --> 06:07:28,240
What what was that?

5007
06:07:36,990 --> 06:07:38,909
Dude that okay. Somebody help me that like

5008
06:07:40,590 --> 06:07:44,909
Like how do you do you dodge through it or to the left right? How do I do get how do I do that?

5009
06:07:46,520 --> 06:07:48,520
That like da da da da da da da

5010
06:07:48,840 --> 06:07:58,729
So if you dodge forward to the right or forward it's in and then to the right so it's forward right

5011
06:07:59,819 --> 06:08:04,299
Right and then back. I think it's in yeah, it's in and to the right

5012
06:08:14,380 --> 06:08:16,400
Wait

5013
06:08:16,400 --> 06:08:18,509
I just saw you

5014
06:08:18,509 --> 06:08:23,389
Kicking up a little a little flame there. It looks like you were doing are you going for some parries here?

5015
06:08:24,029 --> 06:08:29,580
Are you alive?

5016
06:08:29,580 --> 06:08:35,720
Yeah, I don't know. It is

5017
06:08:36,360 --> 06:08:38,759
I forget like what she does that you can parry

5018
06:08:40,360 --> 06:08:42,759
And then you still have to parry her three times

5019
06:08:55,680 --> 06:08:57,680
You can parry waterfowl

5020
06:08:57,759 --> 06:09:06,380
Good luck. You did you die? Did you actually just do that much damage to me? We're just trying to get by man

5021
06:09:06,860 --> 06:09:08,540
We're just trying to get by

5022
06:09:08,540 --> 06:09:37,369
How's that not hurting her it's being real weird

5023
06:09:38,169 --> 06:09:46,860
She could do it

5024
06:09:46,860 --> 06:09:51,560
Be aware

5025
06:09:51,560 --> 06:09:58,479
I'm so paranoid. Yeah

5026
06:09:58,639 --> 06:10:01,759
Easy easy, dude. No fucking damage

5027
06:10:02,560 --> 06:10:14,720
What really?

5028
06:10:14,720 --> 06:10:46,380
Jumping me nice dodge get her

5029
06:10:54,520 --> 06:11:11,360
Watch that she could go up

5030
06:11:28,380 --> 06:11:51,470
Where's the stagger? All right. Oh, what the fuck

5031
06:11:52,330 --> 06:12:07,799
What the fuck we're good. Watch that rot. She's being extra careful. She's on me

5032
06:12:08,360 --> 06:12:21,790
What the fuck is my character doing?

5033
06:12:21,869 --> 06:12:23,869
dude

5034
06:12:25,229 --> 06:12:28,509
She grabbed me from fucking behind again

5035
06:12:31,450 --> 06:12:34,650
She was going for you and she fucking grabbed me

5036
06:12:38,540 --> 06:12:42,939
I rolled like into it. It's just there's so much shit happening on the fucking screen

5037
06:12:49,069 --> 06:12:51,470
I just like forget that she even has that fucking move

5038
06:12:52,110 --> 06:12:54,110
This character sucks

5039
06:12:58,409 --> 06:13:01,209
Uh, she heals when you block by the way, apparently. Yeah, I I know

5040
06:13:02,009 --> 06:13:05,150
She kills you when you don't dude

5041
06:13:20,889 --> 06:13:23,450
I in my I told you my normal playthrough

5042
06:13:23,450 --> 06:13:26,169
I killed her with mimic tear and the whole time my shot was like dude

5043
06:13:26,169 --> 06:13:30,090
She heals when she hits the mimic tear and I just fucking just kept jumping on her until she died

5044
06:13:31,419 --> 06:13:36,139
Sometimes you gotta take the l to get the dub. I beat her with tish. I just let tish fight her

5045
06:13:36,299 --> 06:13:49,779
I was like, I don't even care you saved stir. That was literally a get down. Mr. President

5046
06:14:00,700 --> 06:14:03,200
Oh my god, dude

5047
06:14:03,279 --> 06:14:09,040
I can't I can't i'm stuck. I'm stuck. I can't I can't anakin. I'm too weak. I can't

5048
06:14:22,380 --> 06:14:25,279
All right, dude, are we ever gonna be able to do this?

5049
06:14:25,919 --> 06:14:27,549
Yeah

5050
06:14:27,549 --> 06:14:33,709
I mean we're good until you got one shot by a grab. Hey, but you what I stopped you from getting one shot by the grab

5051
06:14:34,680 --> 06:14:36,680
I don't think it looked like that on my screen

5052
06:14:36,919 --> 06:14:39,099
because I I

5053
06:14:39,180 --> 06:14:41,180
Don't feel like I was in danger

5054
06:14:42,439 --> 06:14:47,159
You know, maybe i'm wrong do you need a great heal? Oh no, you're in there

5055
06:14:47,319 --> 06:14:53,799
Okay, I mean we're either gonna do it or we're not I don't think the extra 20 15% health is gonna be a problem

5056
06:14:54,439 --> 06:14:56,439
I mean if you had a little bit more health last time

5057
06:14:57,000 --> 06:14:59,880
I mean she did it was like almost 100%

5058
06:15:23,400 --> 06:15:24,520
Heal

5059
06:15:24,520 --> 06:15:26,439
Yeah, i'm gonna start hitting her right away

5060
06:15:26,439 --> 06:15:28,439
And she's probably gonna go from here

5061
06:15:30,459 --> 06:15:34,540
Yep

5062
06:15:34,540 --> 06:15:37,419
Oh Jesus she went to you. I'm good

5063
06:15:38,060 --> 06:15:59,720
Afraid that she's gonna do it. That was a weird jump

5064
06:16:10,509 --> 06:16:12,509
Oh, come on

5065
06:16:14,909 --> 06:16:24,380
Come on we gotta do this to the fucking guild

5066
06:16:26,220 --> 06:16:28,400
You know, you know what?

5067
06:16:28,400 --> 06:16:32,319
I think fighting together makes it harder because it's almost like she's going after you

5068
06:16:32,400 --> 06:16:34,400
But like I get hit by her hitbox sometimes

5069
06:16:40,540 --> 06:16:46,139
Oh, I was wondering why I wasn't healing. I was praying. I was pressing the neo heal button from like the last 20 seconds

5070
06:16:58,319 --> 06:17:02,639
Now germa's blaming me what it is. It is kind of fucked up that you're blaming me. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa

5071
06:17:02,799 --> 06:17:08,970
Don't let chat tell you something that didn't happen. I just said that it's almost like fighting her solo would be easier

5072
06:17:10,139 --> 06:17:12,459
So do you want to you want to take turns? No

5073
06:17:17,049 --> 06:17:19,529
I feel like that is saying that i'm it's my fault

5074
06:17:19,930 --> 06:17:23,930
No, no, no, i'm just saying that that I by my presence is making it harder for you

5075
06:17:28,860 --> 06:17:30,860
He's dragging you down, dude

5076
06:17:32,029 --> 06:17:34,029
I mean i'll let you go in

5077
06:17:34,029 --> 06:17:35,790
Solo for a bit

5078
06:17:35,790 --> 06:17:38,029
All right, let me go in in solo

5079
06:17:38,830 --> 06:17:43,229
And I will tell you if I need your help, okay, and then you can come in full health and shit

5080
06:17:44,279 --> 06:17:48,380
Wait a minute. This could be genius

5081
06:17:48,380 --> 06:17:51,259
If you need me, but you won't need me. All right, so if I need you

5082
06:17:52,060 --> 06:17:54,299
I'm gonna call you in you're gonna be full health refreshed

5083
06:17:55,099 --> 06:17:58,299
Yeah, all right. I'm just gonna be in the locker room

5084
06:18:03,340 --> 06:18:06,599
All right

5085
06:18:06,599 --> 06:18:08,509
I'm going in

5086
06:18:08,509 --> 06:18:44,880
Okay

5087
06:18:44,880 --> 06:18:46,979
The forces of diablo grow stronger

5088
06:19:11,240 --> 06:19:15,419
Hey, yeah, I was in just a bad spot for it. Um

5089
06:19:16,540 --> 06:19:18,540
Oh, yes, come on in dude

5090
06:19:19,180 --> 06:19:21,639
Yeah, I got this

5091
06:19:21,639 --> 06:19:30,860
I was just in a bad spot. Oh, good luck. Let's try dude. I gotta get a shield on

5092
06:19:31,419 --> 06:19:34,060
Just block the first one roll the next one. She's an idiot

5093
06:19:34,860 --> 06:19:40,139
Who cares if she heals a little bit chats could always be like, oh she's fucking she dude. No, she's she's healing

5094
06:19:41,340 --> 06:19:43,840
Yeah chat

5095
06:19:43,840 --> 06:19:45,840
Why is she? Oh, okay

5096
06:19:48,409 --> 06:19:51,529
I mean, I don't think I i'm gonna do the whole place like solo though

5097
06:19:54,729 --> 06:19:59,770
Uh, dude, I think it's time. We just bring in two. Oh mega spirit summons and just who gives a shit

5098
06:19:59,770 --> 06:20:02,490
Let's get let's get out of here fights yet and you're giving up

5099
06:20:02,569 --> 06:20:08,729
I don't why do you want to fight millennia this fight sucks absolute balls like you don't who wants to play this?

5100
06:20:09,290 --> 06:20:11,290
Nobody wants to fight this character

5101
06:20:11,689 --> 06:20:14,189
Let's get the summons and get rid of this motherfucker

5102
06:20:15,919 --> 06:20:17,919
But she heals off the summons

5103
06:20:17,919 --> 06:20:36,729
All right, not until the bed. That's fine. And no more screaming. I'm not gonna i'm not i'm not a scream streamer like youtuber. Come on

5104
06:20:37,209 --> 06:20:43,549
Settle down. I have a strategy

5105
06:20:45,069 --> 06:20:46,349
What if we like

5106
06:20:46,349 --> 06:20:51,520
What if we like both fighter?

5107
06:20:51,520 --> 06:20:57,130
Yeah, that works that way we can we can try and keep her staggered for longer

5108
06:20:57,849 --> 06:21:03,130
If like both of us are hitting her. I mean i'm just saying you you give me the go-ahead i'm going back to the spirit summon

5109
06:21:03,849 --> 06:21:06,729
Trainer and i'm just gonna get tish to like plus eight

5110
06:21:07,290 --> 06:21:10,970
Who is she? She is the probably the best summon in the game

5111
06:21:11,849 --> 06:21:13,369
it's just

5112
06:21:13,369 --> 06:21:20,250
Such a good she's so good at everything and she literally killed millennia on by herself. I didn't even do anything when I played it

5113
06:21:25,759 --> 06:21:37,840
Okay

5114
06:21:37,840 --> 06:21:40,880
Let's let's just try both like to see what happens if we both fight her

5115
06:21:43,479 --> 06:21:47,560
Which we've never done before i'll go in first usually you go in first and like curse it

5116
06:21:48,360 --> 06:21:52,139
It's true

5117
06:21:52,139 --> 06:21:54,139
I don't have a fucking spirit bell

5118
06:22:01,209 --> 06:22:03,849
You're playing around with your fucking bell. I thought I thought we were doing this together

5119
06:22:03,930 --> 06:22:07,450
I actually thought we were doing this together and like we would stagger her and you wouldn't miss every swing

5120
06:22:07,689 --> 06:22:12,810
I didn't even get dude. You went up there and just fucking died. You went up there and died dude. I didn't

5121
06:22:20,880 --> 06:22:25,439
Because you're trying to look in your fucking back pocket for queen latifah. Let me out here. Let me out, please

5122
06:22:26,000 --> 06:22:27,840
Somebody please let me out

5123
06:22:27,840 --> 06:22:41,360
Just fucking kidding

5124
06:22:41,360 --> 06:22:43,360
Oh the fight begins

5125
06:22:45,630 --> 06:22:47,630
Oh, I feel so alive

5126
06:22:56,319 --> 06:22:59,680
Jerma what you don't understand is it's a dance. It's a dance

5127
06:23:03,560 --> 06:23:05,560
Which is not even rigged on to beat her

5128
06:23:26,669 --> 06:23:29,720
dance

5129
06:23:29,799 --> 06:23:38,990
Yeah, how come I don't have a spirit bell because it's an item you gotta get do you have a spirit bell?

5130
06:23:39,229 --> 06:23:43,200
How did I not get it?

5131
06:23:43,200 --> 06:23:46,479
I mean, oh, it's it's just random that sucks

5132
06:23:47,040 --> 06:23:52,720
I think it probably counts as a key item and you could probably get it from somewhere. Hold on. Are we sure that I don't have it?

5133
06:23:54,270 --> 06:23:56,270
Wait, wait, wait. I have that rot thing on

5134
06:23:58,299 --> 06:24:14,380
Why do I have we both died? Why do I have the wrong thing? That's weird. I just don't have enough mana

5135
06:24:15,979 --> 06:24:18,919
That's probably not gonna happen

5136
06:24:18,919 --> 06:24:20,919
Just don't die to her like spaghetti

5137
06:24:25,279 --> 06:24:28,319
Okay, come on ralphy that's fucked up

5138
06:25:19,799 --> 06:25:23,799
Um, where are um, i'm going up you you blocked me

5139
06:25:24,759 --> 06:25:26,919
Uh, wait, I can't get it back. Hold on

5140
06:25:28,509 --> 06:25:31,950
Hey, you know what? Just reset reset. We gotta no going going going going i'm in

5141
06:25:33,130 --> 06:25:34,810

5142
06:25:34,810 --> 06:25:37,529
Here. I got uh, I got the spell. Let me use my spell

5143
06:25:43,319 --> 06:25:47,389

5144
06:25:47,470 --> 06:25:58,159
So fresh one more one more you beat this game. How are you so bad?

5145
06:26:00,490 --> 06:26:02,490
dude

5146
06:26:02,569 --> 06:26:15,119
I'm gonna respond to that one real fight real focus if you lose this auto gets it. I'm day

5147
06:26:15,680 --> 06:26:17,680
I'm going in i'm in i'm already in where are you?

5148
06:26:47,950 --> 06:27:18,560
If she's she doing some jumps going in

5149
06:27:46,110 --> 06:27:48,110
Every time you go to attack

5150
06:27:48,189 --> 06:27:50,189
She moves the other player

5151
06:28:09,979 --> 06:28:13,950
Easy

5152
06:28:13,950 --> 06:28:15,950
Yeah, she is kind of easy, huh?

5153
06:28:16,430 --> 06:28:20,889
It's very actually very hard. Where were you looking?

5154
06:28:21,610 --> 06:28:24,970
I'm, all right, but that was very annoying. I'm incredibly annoyed by it

5155
06:28:25,689 --> 06:29:22,840
Okay, hold on. Oh that's what she's doing

5156
06:29:25,639 --> 06:29:27,639
Dude, what is she doing?

5157
06:29:28,360 --> 06:29:30,360
What is she doing?

5158
06:29:30,750 --> 06:29:51,479
I saved you

5159
06:29:51,479 --> 06:29:53,720
Little bro doesn't even have his controller plugged in

5160
06:29:56,189 --> 06:30:12,569
What are you talking about talking about me man last heal besides slow heal

5161
06:30:15,979 --> 06:30:18,159
Damn, she really sick with it

5162
06:30:28,349 --> 06:30:36,619
I gotta save him

5163
06:30:36,619 --> 06:30:38,619
This is the weird ghost shit

5164
06:30:45,400 --> 06:30:47,900
I'm dead. I'm on my head

5165
06:30:50,750 --> 06:30:52,750
Dude, i'm going out. I'm going out

5166
06:30:53,310 --> 06:30:57,790
I expelled all the air out of my body. It's just fucking I saw stars for one second

5167
06:31:10,200 --> 06:31:13,119
It's so hard

5168
06:31:13,119 --> 06:31:26,189
Best one yet. That was pretty good. Try your l2. It takes so long. It's not worth it. That was a good attempt

5169
06:31:30,060 --> 06:31:34,139
Is it what so the ghost move I somehow dodged every single one?

5170
06:31:34,299 --> 06:31:35,680
I don't even know how I did it

5171
06:31:35,680 --> 06:31:37,200
She attacked me with every single one

5172
06:31:37,200 --> 06:31:41,599
It's just the pillars were in the way and I had no idea when she was casting it. You were in the flow state

5173
06:31:41,840 --> 06:31:44,459
You hit trance

5174
06:31:44,459 --> 06:31:47,819
You know what i'm saying? I thought we had it there

5175
06:31:48,639 --> 06:31:53,439
I know what you're thinking, but it's probably whatever you're trying to say skip the ladder all together

5176
06:31:56,090 --> 06:32:07,290
Actually, probably a good idea

5177
06:32:07,290 --> 06:32:10,569
I do have the boiled crabs. I feel like it's time to we got to use these

5178
06:32:11,369 --> 06:32:17,529
We picked up I used one that fight. We just we picked up so much random shit like it's um, how do you even remember?

5179
06:32:18,909 --> 06:32:23,069
I guess i'll put them on the bar

5180
06:32:23,069 --> 06:32:25,040
uh

5181
06:32:25,040 --> 06:32:33,150
Okay

5182
06:32:33,150 --> 06:32:39,709
I tried to hit b to back out of the menu and you saw it happen next. Yeah, you know naturally that's naturally that's how it happens

5183
06:32:40,590 --> 06:32:42,590
You just you know, you're pressing b

5184
06:32:42,750 --> 06:33:04,319
Can I get one of those heels when I get back up?

5185
06:33:06,139 --> 06:33:23,450
Sure, all right. Let me actually put them on the bar because i'll use them and I'd eat them both at the same time

5186
06:33:30,060 --> 06:33:37,159
Okay, I have been using my wondrous disease

5187
06:33:40,619 --> 06:34:01,770
Remember the one I was gonna go. I was gonna go as long as it took. Do you want some crabs and

5188
06:34:02,490 --> 06:34:08,919
Whatever. These are do you want some? Uh, I don't think I need them. I uh, I already had, you know the whole eating, you know

5189
06:34:09,880 --> 06:34:11,340
Are they raw?

5190
06:34:11,340 --> 06:34:13,740
No, they're boiled. Let's go. I don't want I don't want them

5191
06:34:18,700 --> 06:34:20,799
Melania

5192
06:34:20,799 --> 06:34:22,799
It's time for you to pay

5193
06:34:22,799 --> 06:34:53,770
That was unfortunate, but

5194
06:34:53,770 --> 06:34:56,009
My game was lagging so bad during that. I was worried

5195
06:35:11,479 --> 06:35:14,939
Oh my god

5196
06:35:14,939 --> 06:35:18,060
Thank you. Yeah, that might have just saved me. I was just so

5197
06:35:19,180 --> 06:35:22,540
I'm so desperately trying to make it so you all right. I don't want to die here

5198
06:35:23,900 --> 06:35:25,340
Okay, i'm coming

5199
06:35:25,340 --> 06:35:27,310
Oh god

5200
06:35:27,310 --> 06:35:37,630
She turned around to do it to you. I need a second. I'm not with you

5201
06:35:38,189 --> 06:35:40,189
All right, be aware of that

5202
06:35:50,729 --> 06:36:06,909
Oh fuck

5203
06:36:06,909 --> 06:36:22,619
Nice one

5204
06:36:22,619 --> 06:36:27,689
She went down

5205
06:36:27,689 --> 06:36:29,849
Get her. Okay. All right. All right. Heal up

5206
06:36:30,490 --> 06:36:32,490
Heal up and get ready. Heal up and get ready

5207
06:36:37,400 --> 06:36:44,169
What wait? I don't she needs one hit

5208
06:36:47,389 --> 06:36:50,810
Yes

5209
06:36:50,810 --> 06:36:52,889
Okay, uh, I don't have any mana for

5210
06:36:53,610 --> 06:36:55,549
repeal

5211
06:36:55,549 --> 06:36:57,549
What the heck I dodged it quiet

5212
06:37:03,259 --> 06:37:06,060
Let's show her why we're the actual rot boys

5213
06:37:18,240 --> 06:37:20,319
I'm covered in rot. I'm covered in rot. It's bad

5214
06:37:21,040 --> 06:37:22,720
It's real bad

5215
06:37:22,720 --> 06:37:48,639
I'm all right. I'm just eating food over here. I'm buying time for you. I'm not let's go

5216
06:37:49,439 --> 06:38:15,869
I would expect the shadows. Yep

5217
06:38:17,200 --> 06:38:19,200
She's chasing you hard. Yeah, there she goes

5218
06:38:20,060 --> 06:38:22,060
You just run far enough away. It won't get you

5219
06:38:22,299 --> 06:38:38,619
I don't think that's accurate though

5220
06:38:38,619 --> 06:38:54,639
I can't see shit. Where am I? Yeah same god damn it lock on

5221
06:38:58,520 --> 06:39:00,520
Oh, she's doing this bullshit again

5222
06:39:01,479 --> 06:39:11,400
She should full heal during that

5223
06:39:20,430 --> 06:39:24,110
Oh, no, I didn't know that's what she was doing. I thought she was going towards you with the

5224
06:39:24,830 --> 06:39:26,830
Oh, man, I didn't know she was doing that

5225
06:39:27,799 --> 06:39:32,299
Fuck. I thought she was doing the thing. She puts the sword in the ground. It does the explosion

5226
06:39:33,099 --> 06:39:39,720
Well, good luck

5227
06:39:39,720 --> 06:39:55,950
Whoa, wow, what the fuck that's what I thought she was doing

5228
06:39:56,669 --> 06:39:58,669
Always assume it's waterfowl. I also

5229
06:39:59,069 --> 06:40:01,069
She was aiming at stir figured I could get in there

5230
06:40:01,790 --> 06:40:07,610
I got no more heals. This is it. Yes. No, I got one more. This is rough

5231
06:40:11,319 --> 06:40:13,319
She's she's just healed

5232
06:40:30,200 --> 06:40:32,360
The l2 is insane damage

5233
06:40:32,360 --> 06:40:32,680
Yeah

5234
06:40:32,680 --> 06:40:38,040
I just I did it once and I must have pressed it again because I did the second part and I really didn't want to and that's

5235
06:40:38,040 --> 06:40:59,450
More kind of fell apart for me. That was a really good attempt though. It's unfortunate

5236
06:41:02,270 --> 06:41:03,229
Yeah

5237
06:41:03,229 --> 06:41:08,509
Or should I have like any other weapon for this? I have a dagger that reduces max hp. What do you mean?

5238
06:41:09,759 --> 06:41:12,080
Didn't you have some like fully upgraded faith sword?

5239
06:41:12,880 --> 06:41:15,119
Wait, i'm not even faith. Never mind. What is this?

5240
06:41:27,150 --> 06:41:33,610
What do you mean?

5241
06:41:33,610 --> 06:42:07,240
I use this this is good with no upgrades. No, this is just gonna have to come down to us being gamers. I think

5242
06:42:12,540 --> 06:42:16,939
Is it a debuff? I mean, I I don't there's no harm in me keeping it on I could try it see what it does

5243
06:42:17,500 --> 06:42:28,119
I'll try it. I went the wrong way. All right, I will tell you i'm getting a little bit of gamer fatigue

5244
06:42:29,080 --> 06:42:31,560
A little bit of gamer fatigue. I'm getting a little bit of gamer fatigue

5245
06:42:32,279 --> 06:42:34,840
And that's understandable that was just unfortunate what just happened

5246
06:42:35,319 --> 06:42:37,400
I mean, it's like it's fine because we're gonna win this one

5247
06:42:47,150 --> 06:42:49,150
Make sure that guy with the spear on the stairs

5248
06:42:49,790 --> 06:42:53,549
Can you please just like walk a little bit further? I did

5249
06:42:54,909 --> 06:42:59,069
I did this fucking worms in you dude. You are you are gamer fatigued

5250
06:43:10,439 --> 06:43:12,439
Wait, it's not yes. Not you

5251
06:43:13,099 --> 06:43:14,139
we're

5252
06:43:14,139 --> 06:43:19,080
What we're what the fuck I was doing a thing where I was gonna come back down and bow to you

5253
06:43:22,029 --> 06:43:24,400
All this too, right?

5254
06:43:24,400 --> 06:43:34,220
Wow, that's a big heal. Why is that so bad? How much faith do you have?

5255
06:43:35,950 --> 06:43:37,950
I have the arcane scaling

5256
06:43:38,110 --> 06:43:40,750
Oh

5257
06:43:40,750 --> 06:43:42,750
I think told that that would work

5258
06:43:51,080 --> 06:43:53,080
Arcane doesn't enhance faith incantations

5259
06:43:53,720 --> 06:43:59,479
Okay. Well, I feel like I was asking a lot of a lot of people said yes. Okay, let's see what happens here

5260
06:44:04,240 --> 06:44:05,919
Holy shit

5261
06:44:05,919 --> 06:44:07,919
Um, excuse me

5262
06:44:16,400 --> 06:44:20,000
You wait a minute you mean to tell me I could just sit back and just do that

5263
06:44:20,720 --> 06:44:27,049
Oh, you got like the moog sword

5264
06:44:28,159 --> 06:44:30,159
It's just doing this weird like dot

5265
06:44:30,720 --> 06:44:36,240
How long does it last?

5266
06:44:36,240 --> 06:44:38,240
Holy shit. That thing is fucking disgusting

5267
06:44:39,819 --> 06:44:41,659
Okay. Well, I didn't that's cool

5268
06:44:41,659 --> 06:44:42,860
full weapon

5269
06:44:42,860 --> 06:44:54,569
She might go sicko mode soon

5270
06:44:54,650 --> 06:45:12,029
I would expect it

5271
06:45:12,029 --> 06:45:14,590
Give her her space. She needs her space

5272
06:45:22,110 --> 06:45:31,709
Holy shit

5273
06:45:31,709 --> 06:45:33,709
I expect it like right now

5274
06:45:33,709 --> 06:45:55,259
I can't believe she hasn't done it

5275
06:45:55,340 --> 06:46:11,770
Oh my god

5276
06:46:11,770 --> 06:46:17,209
What chat doesn't understand is that she's also god-skinned. All right, here she comes. Oh my fucking god

5277
06:46:19,900 --> 06:46:21,659
Okay

5278
06:46:21,659 --> 06:46:23,340
That's um

5279
06:46:23,340 --> 06:46:46,569
That's a full sprint

5280
06:46:47,290 --> 06:46:48,490
Fuck

5281
06:46:48,490 --> 06:46:54,330
This sucks. It's so fucking hard. I remember hating this just as much as I did before on the regular game

5282
06:46:55,369 --> 06:46:59,130
Delete this delete this character from the game delete this character

5283
06:47:04,009 --> 06:47:06,509
Uh, I can upgrade the dagger

5284
06:47:09,049 --> 06:47:11,049
I really need to switch off faith

5285
06:47:11,130 --> 06:47:17,900
I it was it was a bad call. What does this scale with?

5286
06:47:21,419 --> 06:47:23,419
It's it's just faith index

5287
06:47:26,880 --> 06:47:28,880
Try just go pump this up like crazy

5288
06:47:40,279 --> 06:47:46,040
Uh people how much faith do you have? It's you have arcane. Don't you I have like 50 arcane

5289
06:47:46,360 --> 06:47:48,360
Yeah, so that way this wouldn't work with you

5290
06:47:48,520 --> 06:47:52,000
I'm gonna go upgrade this thing

5291
06:47:52,000 --> 06:47:53,119
And i'm gonna

5292
06:47:53,119 --> 06:47:54,479
You know what?

5293
06:47:54,479 --> 06:47:56,479
Desperate times desperate measures

5294
06:47:56,560 --> 06:48:00,479
Here's what we're doing i'm gonna just take a shitload of mana potions i'm gonna go upgrade the knife

5295
06:48:01,040 --> 06:48:04,080
And i'm just gonna be a coward dot loser

5296
06:48:08,569 --> 06:48:13,209
Okay, i'm gonna go respect back to magic and get my glintstone pebble on because it actually did damage

5297
06:48:18,360 --> 06:48:20,200
I need souls though

5298
06:48:20,200 --> 06:48:26,110
I could probably sell some shit. I also thought we picked up the uh

5299
06:48:27,209 --> 06:48:32,939
Like the blast ray whatever and I got excited but I I don't see it in my inventory

5300
06:48:33,659 --> 06:48:43,979
I don't know. Well, I don't have to fight this. Okay, this is kind of your tiring

5301
06:48:45,180 --> 06:48:47,180
Yeah, i'm getting the same thing

5302
06:48:48,400 --> 06:48:50,400
Oh, it's so spooky

5303
06:48:58,250 --> 06:49:01,000
Okay, so

5304
06:49:01,979 --> 06:49:03,979
How much better it'll be when it's leveled up

5305
06:50:13,360 --> 06:50:45,419
All right 480 I don't care doesn't upgrade the dot do not do this upgrading the dagger does not increase the dot

5306
06:50:50,990 --> 06:50:54,509
Come on Miyazaki why did everybody let me do this?

5307
06:50:57,520 --> 06:50:59,520
Wait, they told you the faith stuff scales

5308
06:51:00,240 --> 06:51:03,119
Wrong like afterwards. I thought the l2 was gonna

5309
06:51:03,840 --> 06:51:06,200
I feel like everybody was right, dude

5310
06:51:09,119 --> 06:51:12,700
Maybe i'll use this weapon frick

5311
06:51:20,189 --> 06:51:22,189
Well, uh, never mind

5312
06:51:22,189 --> 06:51:27,119
I'm ready

5313
06:51:27,119 --> 06:51:29,119
The l2 will stun lock millennia

5314
06:51:29,439 --> 06:51:35,740
That's true, but I can only do it a few times before I need to drink and then I might just die. That's right

5315
06:51:40,490 --> 06:51:41,930
Oh frick

5316
06:51:41,930 --> 06:51:44,700
Bleed is really strong against millennia. Yeah

5317
06:51:45,500 --> 06:51:47,880
What is this?

5318
06:51:47,880 --> 06:51:50,680
Weapon that I have big what is this thing? Is this bleed?

5319
06:51:52,590 --> 06:51:54,029
Now it's fire

5320
06:51:54,029 --> 06:51:58,919
Do I have a bleed weapon?

5321
06:51:58,919 --> 06:52:07,240
What a bleed dagger in your other hand

5322
06:52:11,020 --> 06:52:15,340
I don't know if I even have one

5323
06:52:15,340 --> 06:52:20,270
scarlet rob

5324
06:52:20,270 --> 06:52:22,090
um

5325
06:52:22,090 --> 06:52:24,250
This thing does it's not too slow though

5326
06:52:27,659 --> 06:52:31,450
This would be great

5327
06:52:31,450 --> 06:52:33,450
I could do a wheel

5328
06:52:33,509 --> 06:52:39,340
Respec a real one. I'm gonna go respect

5329
06:52:39,740 --> 06:52:47,799
How many of those tears do I have?

5330
06:52:47,799 --> 06:52:50,169
Just because I this is a really dumb idea

5331
06:52:53,709 --> 06:53:04,959
I have one I really thought I got the laser beam

5332
06:53:05,759 --> 06:53:11,819
I'm doing it. I'm gonna have to live with my what I do here

5333
06:53:12,939 --> 06:53:19,369
I'm doing it. You have rivers of blood. I sold rivers of blood for a joke because I said look what i'm doing to the op item

5334
06:53:19,930 --> 06:53:26,299
Is it thy wish?

5335
06:53:26,299 --> 06:53:28,299
Oh, hold on. I would but

5336
06:53:35,689 --> 06:53:38,919
Is this standard?

5337
06:53:38,919 --> 06:53:40,919
upgrades stones

5338
06:53:40,919 --> 06:53:51,479
Is it somber?

5339
06:53:51,479 --> 06:53:55,159
I have one two, three, four five six seven eight. Okay

5340
06:53:56,119 --> 06:53:58,459
I can do it. I can get update. I mean uh plus nine

5341
06:53:59,099 --> 06:54:00,599
Or plus eight

5342
06:54:00,599 --> 06:54:09,869
Why do you keep play this game? It's taking you like a year to complete it

5343
06:54:10,430 --> 06:54:14,909
my friend

5344
06:54:14,909 --> 06:54:16,830
That we're doing a random. I

5345
06:54:16,830 --> 06:54:18,750
You you you responded

5346
06:54:18,750 --> 06:54:21,979
um

5347
06:54:21,979 --> 06:54:24,810
Uh, uh, geez, um

5348
06:54:26,439 --> 06:54:28,279
Oh geez

5349
06:54:28,279 --> 06:54:32,759
Does this scale more with strength or dex probably strength? I would imagine 28 18. Okay

5350
06:54:35,310 --> 06:54:37,310
Oh, yeah, I forgot that I had the true counter

5351
06:54:38,380 --> 06:55:26,000
We win now need arcane

5352
06:55:29,819 --> 06:55:31,869
No, I don't

5353
06:55:31,869 --> 06:55:37,560
No, the thing already has 70 bleed. It's quality scaling

5354
06:55:42,139 --> 06:55:48,669
Was that all right? No, no arcane

5355
06:55:53,549 --> 06:55:55,950
Did I put the other two in so I do 22 or?

5356
06:55:56,729 --> 06:56:00,810
37

5357
06:56:00,810 --> 06:56:15,919
Go like 30 27. It's quality scaling. Then this is fine, right?

5358
06:56:16,560 --> 06:56:22,119
It scales d and both

5359
06:56:26,959 --> 06:56:39,229
You're so fucked dude the dagger you dumbass I

5360
06:56:39,790 --> 06:56:42,590
We're not we're going for a new strategy. I'm going for just pizza cutter

5361
06:56:43,229 --> 06:56:47,689
To see when it's okay. So then this is yeah, this is fine

5362
06:56:49,159 --> 06:56:53,229
Like that, uh now I can just go like this boom boom boom, right?

5363
06:56:55,290 --> 06:57:04,520
That's fine. This is fine. Hey there pal. Do you have any smithing stones seven?

5364
06:57:05,159 --> 06:57:06,840
I probably do

5365
06:57:06,840 --> 06:57:27,680
This is uh, this is fine help germa because he's dude. There's fucking like

5366
06:57:28,400 --> 06:57:31,439
Thousands of people trying to help germa. I I got nothing

5367
06:57:33,659 --> 06:57:37,500
He doesn't need my help. You got this king fucking sleigh

5368
06:57:38,220 --> 06:57:39,419
I'm ready

5369
06:57:39,419 --> 06:57:42,779
Now I upgrade them seven fuck out of this thing and i'm gonna go

5370
06:57:44,459 --> 06:57:46,939
And i'm gonna millennia is gonna turn into swiss cheese

5371
06:57:49,979 --> 06:58:00,880
Okay, I need to just get some souls real quick. Where should I go?

5372
06:58:00,959 --> 06:58:02,959
Where's that place do we get 10k for doing nothing?

5373
06:58:04,619 --> 06:58:26,590
Oh by fia underground let this guy fucking knead his dough

5374
06:58:33,840 --> 06:58:38,830
Millennia you don't stand a chance

5375
06:58:41,000 --> 06:58:44,029
Millennia you are gonna die

5376
06:58:49,630 --> 06:59:03,290
in minecraft

5377
06:59:03,290 --> 06:59:09,450
Absolutely power this thing up. What? Oh

5378
06:59:11,369 --> 06:59:13,369
Uh, so for this next fight

5379
06:59:14,729 --> 06:59:17,130
I was thinking of hiring someone off like a

5380
06:59:17,689 --> 06:59:21,950
Like a gamer website to like use like, you know, take control of my pc and play for me

5381
06:59:22,990 --> 06:59:24,990
And then you can act like you're doing it

5382
06:59:26,639 --> 06:59:29,130
But I just want to let you guys know I decided not to

5383
06:59:29,849 --> 06:59:31,290
Very good idea

5384
06:59:31,290 --> 06:59:34,560
I actually have a bell bearing to look at

5385
06:59:37,979 --> 06:59:44,990
That gamer website

5386
06:59:44,990 --> 06:59:48,189
I am i'm ready unless there's a smithing seven

5387
06:59:48,990 --> 06:59:50,990

5388
06:59:51,549 --> 06:59:54,540
Cannot help you out there

5389
06:59:54,540 --> 07:00:09,279
I have up to six just wanted to go the long way

5390
07:00:11,020 --> 07:00:12,430
Okay

5391
07:00:12,430 --> 07:00:16,990
I wonder how much better this is gonna be. I feel like it's gonna be people are giving me shit for this

5392
07:00:17,069 --> 07:00:19,069
But I feel like it's gonna be better

5393
07:00:21,790 --> 07:00:26,330
320 this thing look at this

5394
07:00:27,869 --> 07:00:30,509
269 119 already

5395
07:00:31,150 --> 07:00:54,240
Hold on. Yeah, i'm gonna put the hp flask back in

5396
07:00:54,880 --> 07:01:06,409
All right people gonna be really upset with me, but I don't care

5397
07:01:06,970 --> 07:01:32,189
Hey, if you're ever indeed of ruins

5398
07:01:32,990 --> 07:01:34,990
Just go to where fia is

5399
07:01:35,389 --> 07:01:40,349
Walk forward like not towards her but like the other way two seconds you get 11 000

5400
07:01:40,509 --> 07:01:43,150
Just reset it and you do it as many times as you want if I ever need runes

5401
07:01:43,150 --> 07:01:45,150
I'm just gonna kill milenia

5402
07:01:45,150 --> 07:01:59,470
I just wanted to get it easy

5403
07:01:59,470 --> 07:02:09,930
first try

5404
07:02:09,930 --> 07:02:16,380
All right. I am moments away from being ready for you to put your thing down. We'll try this again

5405
07:02:17,180 --> 07:02:21,740
I've got to say maybe maybe like four or five more attempts before I need to eat food

5406
07:02:22,700 --> 07:02:26,939
And I need to oh relax and go to this guy fucking eats

5407
07:02:27,340 --> 07:02:29,159
food

5408
07:02:29,159 --> 07:02:31,099
Okay

5409
07:02:31,099 --> 07:02:35,580
All right. All of a sudden you're like into like do a somber smithing stone nine

5410
07:02:39,099 --> 07:02:42,200
Uh, that's the ancient one. It is not

5411
07:02:43,689 --> 07:02:45,689
Isn't it though? It's not

5412
07:02:46,599 --> 07:02:49,930
I don't you have a seven

5413
07:02:50,090 --> 07:02:53,049
I don't have a seven, but I am ready for you to put down your thing

5414
07:02:53,849 --> 07:03:00,430
Okay, i'm ready

5415
07:03:00,430 --> 07:03:02,430
I'm traveling

5416
07:03:07,080 --> 07:03:24,119
The manner please come to my world isn't your food gonna taste so much better after we are victorious

5417
07:03:27,080 --> 07:03:31,159
And you sit down and you put that fucking that hot cake in your mouth the crab cake

5418
07:03:35,369 --> 07:03:37,229
Okay, you got it done

5419
07:03:37,229 --> 07:03:42,840
Yeah, he's done

5420
07:03:43,000 --> 07:03:45,479
No, no more time for conversation. It's game time

5421
07:03:46,619 --> 07:03:49,819
I'm wearing a green shirt today and people will freaking out

5422
07:03:55,520 --> 07:03:57,520
All right, look at my new toy

5423
07:03:58,080 --> 07:03:59,759
Look at my outfit

5424
07:03:59,759 --> 07:04:08,509
all right, uh, I

5425
07:04:08,750 --> 07:04:10,909
After seeing that well, I wish us the best of luck

5426
07:04:13,759 --> 07:04:16,159
Coming. Yeah, I just I don't even know what the move set is

5427
07:04:19,720 --> 07:04:24,650
Neither does she

5428
07:04:24,650 --> 07:04:26,650
Look at how much more health I have though

5429
07:04:27,130 --> 07:04:30,270
Oh my god

5430
07:04:33,630 --> 07:04:35,630
I do miss the uh

5431
07:04:36,590 --> 07:04:53,799
I think i'm gonna have time to calm it as well

5432
07:04:54,439 --> 07:04:57,919
Oh, I don't even have mana. I didn't get myself mana potions

5433
07:05:06,319 --> 07:05:07,680
Exeter's hat

5434
07:05:07,680 --> 07:05:10,319
What about my hat?

5435
07:05:10,319 --> 07:05:23,389
Uh who wore it best?

5436
07:05:23,389 --> 07:05:25,950
You want to go again or with like what's going on here? I'm fine

5437
07:05:34,169 --> 07:05:35,849
I've

5438
07:05:35,849 --> 07:05:37,849
Haven't fought this boss before

5439
07:05:53,419 --> 07:05:55,419
Maybe our worst attempt yet

5440
07:06:04,509 --> 07:06:13,849
Just keep her in the corner

5441
07:06:14,090 --> 07:06:20,349
i'm dead

5442
07:06:20,349 --> 07:06:21,950
Surely it gets better

5443
07:06:21,950 --> 07:06:25,290
This thing's fucking awful. This thing is bad

5444
07:06:42,200 --> 07:06:44,200
I want her to heal

5445
07:06:54,889 --> 07:06:58,220
Yeah, I expected it to deal like

5446
07:06:58,299 --> 07:07:23,200
Damage, uh, I don't have any more larval tears. We said this was horrible. Well, okay. Hold on. I feel like this would be really good

5447
07:07:24,159 --> 07:07:26,270
If we could coordinate it

5448
07:07:26,270 --> 07:07:31,150
So like I go in there and I just start like grind grind grind grind grind grind grind and you can just get in there and just

5449
07:07:31,470 --> 07:07:33,470
Attack with all your most powerful moves

5450
07:07:35,869 --> 07:07:37,869
You grind her and I common azor

5451
07:07:39,259 --> 07:07:40,560
I mean

5452
07:07:40,560 --> 07:07:41,919
I wish you had it

5453
07:07:41,919 --> 07:07:43,759
I do you do

5454
07:07:43,759 --> 07:07:47,360
Yeah, I mean we could try to be just wacky

5455
07:07:48,240 --> 07:07:50,400
I I don't think it's gonna do that much. My staff isn't

5456
07:07:50,959 --> 07:07:57,740
Upgraded as much

5457
07:08:01,900 --> 07:08:05,360
Watch out bad guys

5458
07:08:05,360 --> 07:08:06,959
Let's get in the vader

5459
07:08:06,959 --> 07:08:15,470
What if we just like hit her?

5460
07:08:16,349 --> 07:08:18,110
Maybe that would work too

5461
07:08:18,110 --> 07:08:25,150
This thing does pretty good damage though

5462
07:08:26,939 --> 07:08:29,099
I was doing like a 1100 to swing right there

5463
07:08:29,819 --> 07:08:34,409
All right, let's go for it. I think it's a little slower than the thing I was using before

5464
07:08:47,630 --> 07:08:49,869
Dude, all right. Okay

5465
07:08:51,400 --> 07:08:53,400
Not bad not bad

5466
07:08:53,959 --> 07:08:59,720
Fucking god. Damn it

5467
07:09:02,319 --> 07:09:05,360
I had a aneurysm and forgot how to switch to my shield

5468
07:09:06,319 --> 07:09:17,229
I can't if you have to sprint away during that move

5469
07:09:43,979 --> 07:09:45,979
Don't laugh i'm doing all right

5470
07:09:45,979 --> 07:09:48,779
You're grinding her off. She's just like fucking punching you in the face

5471
07:09:56,619 --> 07:09:58,619
It's a lot. It's just a lot of stamina

5472
07:09:58,860 --> 07:10:01,900
Is that okay if you were alive, but we put it up with pretty good

5473
07:10:02,700 --> 07:10:04,299
I messed up bad

5474
07:10:04,299 --> 07:10:10,110
I had a goof moment

5475
07:10:10,110 --> 07:10:12,270
Like for like a brief second when she went up in the air

5476
07:10:12,270 --> 07:10:18,599
I could feel that I was in the matrix and I kind of doubted the reality. Yeah the

5477
07:10:19,319 --> 07:10:22,119
The l2 is not really can I do any moves from l2?

5478
07:10:22,759 --> 07:10:30,840
I wonder let me check

5479
07:10:30,840 --> 07:10:36,540
You cannot

5480
07:10:36,540 --> 07:10:40,619
Why everybody does that anytime you like look down to look at something down your like sure to you touch your eyes

5481
07:10:40,619 --> 07:10:45,319
You just everybody goes

5482
07:10:45,319 --> 07:11:05,790
Why?

5483
07:11:05,790 --> 07:11:08,889
What was that?

5484
07:11:08,889 --> 07:11:11,069
What is what?

5485
07:11:11,069 --> 07:11:13,389
They just like make up new enemies down here

5486
07:11:14,970 --> 07:11:16,330
i'm dead

5487
07:11:16,330 --> 07:11:41,229
What is that dog? Is he up there coming boss? Hopefully this time the sky like doesn't fall on me

5488
07:11:49,340 --> 07:11:51,340
Use the black knife. I don't think I can anymore

5489
07:11:51,340 --> 07:11:55,819
I needed 18 faith which eight points to be able to do that one move is I don't think it's worth it

5490
07:12:09,439 --> 07:12:11,040
Keep her in the corner

5491
07:12:11,040 --> 07:12:14,590
There's a closer bonfire. Yeah, i've heard people say that

5492
07:12:15,389 --> 07:12:17,549
But we're in we're in gamer fatigue mode right now

5493
07:12:17,549 --> 07:12:20,270
I don't think you can you wouldn't be able to direct us to where we need to go

5494
07:12:26,959 --> 07:12:36,959
That guy is sick of getting killed. He's left over the bridge

5495
07:12:37,759 --> 07:12:40,060
Maybe we'll give it a look

5496
07:12:56,779 --> 07:13:01,259
That was not worth the man. Not really, but it was very good knockback

5497
07:13:08,540 --> 07:13:10,540
Oh, that's fucking fantastic

5498
07:13:28,569 --> 07:13:30,569
We got our locks in we do

5499
07:13:31,450 --> 07:13:34,840
Okay, easy easy

5500
07:13:35,159 --> 07:13:58,889
I can't believe I didn't

5501
07:13:59,689 --> 07:14:00,810
No

5502
07:14:00,810 --> 07:14:02,330
No stamina

5503
07:14:02,330 --> 07:14:12,459
Just getting ready for the next phase

5504
07:14:12,459 --> 07:14:20,400
What was the stagger on that shit?

5505
07:14:20,799 --> 07:14:39,369
That's the first time I got hit by the second part. Oh fuck off

5506
07:14:52,299 --> 07:14:54,299
Stop losing fucking lock on

5507
07:14:54,860 --> 07:15:23,400
Come on you piece of shit

5508
07:15:23,400 --> 07:15:43,310
kill her

5509
07:15:43,549 --> 07:16:02,750
Can I do a fucking move in the fucking video game?

5510
07:16:11,740 --> 07:16:18,560
Dude, you just you can't even swing at her. You can't swing the fucking weapon at her

5511
07:16:19,119 --> 07:16:21,119
She's just constantly doing a move

5512
07:16:22,779 --> 07:16:41,119
Huh stamina was almost out. It's just I feel like she's just going like this. Can I play can I from software?

5513
07:16:41,119 --> 07:16:54,540
Can I play the game? That is the game. It's a dance

5514
07:16:57,680 --> 07:16:59,439
Yeah, I remember

5515
07:16:59,439 --> 07:17:02,479
Dude, it's a dance. Uh, well, can we just can we like

5516
07:17:02,959 --> 07:17:05,439
Can we do like can we fucking floss or something?

5517
07:17:12,000 --> 07:17:14,000
You shouldn't use this your weapons too slow

5518
07:17:14,400 --> 07:17:18,319
What it would just have to delete a whole class of items to play against millennia

5519
07:17:30,080 --> 07:17:33,040
The omen killer. I feel like the omen killer was was slower

5520
07:17:36,860 --> 07:17:46,159
All right last attempt last attempt before we put a new seed in and delete her from the game now i'm angry

5521
07:17:52,590 --> 07:17:55,529
Hopefully not too angry

5522
07:17:55,529 --> 07:17:57,529
Not just angry enough to fucking like

5523
07:17:57,849 --> 07:18:02,840
Go hard. Oh, i've been hard

5524
07:18:03,799 --> 07:18:16,080
Uh back to one

5525
07:18:21,759 --> 07:18:27,200
Oh, because I don't have as much stamina or fucking health as I did before so I don't even think I can do that anymore

5526
07:18:52,490 --> 07:18:56,569
Sorry, sir. This is personal. No, that's cool

5527
07:18:57,689 --> 07:19:00,860
my bad for

5528
07:19:00,860 --> 07:19:02,159
Yeah

5529
07:19:02,159 --> 07:19:03,759
for existing

5530
07:19:03,759 --> 07:20:12,009
Fine. Fuck you. I thought I dodged again

5531
07:20:51,290 --> 07:20:58,860
But like what if we did like one more I didn't get a fair I do I she had more health than when you fucking died

5532
07:20:59,259 --> 07:21:03,419
I fought her for like an extra five minutes. Yeah

5533
07:21:06,479 --> 07:21:24,509
Yeah, you know what they say can't win them all change your weapon. It's over

5534
07:21:24,830 --> 07:21:31,049
I can't the only way I can change this weapon is if we randomly get another larval tear

5535
07:21:32,069 --> 07:21:37,630
Somewhere I have one you do. Yeah, i'm not honestly not giving up on this yet, though

5536
07:21:37,709 --> 07:21:43,529
I actually the bleed is really good when you get it to go off. I don't I don't I think it's okay

5537
07:21:43,689 --> 07:21:48,490
I don't hate it that went real quick from if we had a larval tear to

5538
07:21:49,450 --> 07:21:50,840
No

5539
07:21:50,840 --> 07:21:54,270
It's really not that bad

5540
07:21:54,270 --> 07:21:56,270
Stagger is good anything out of this helmet

5541
07:21:56,830 --> 07:21:59,790
I I fucked up my respect because I have less health and less stamina

5542
07:22:00,430 --> 07:22:02,250
it's just well I

5543
07:22:02,250 --> 07:22:03,209
got

5544
07:22:03,209 --> 07:22:08,090
Shit on a lot quicker than I thought I was I just want to smoke weed with the better chaos like I just

5545
07:22:09,020 --> 07:22:38,729
Really want that

5546
07:22:38,729 --> 07:22:45,209
There you go. Yeah, let's go. Let's go and the bleed to play an extra safe play safe

5547
07:22:46,319 --> 07:22:48,319
Yep, exactly why we just did that

5548
07:22:50,240 --> 07:22:53,200
I got caught on a fucking you're good. You're good. You're good. You're good

5549
07:22:53,200 --> 07:22:55,759
No, you're good. You're good. You're good. You're good. Everything's all good, man. We're good

5550
07:22:56,639 --> 07:23:35,069
Could do it again soon

5551
07:23:35,069 --> 07:23:38,569
Yeah

5552
07:23:38,569 --> 07:23:42,959
Good very clean so clean well diddled

5553
07:23:53,610 --> 07:24:01,180
sucks losing the

5554
07:24:01,180 --> 07:24:28,029
nice

5555
07:24:28,029 --> 07:24:47,580
Paranoid all right eat whatever you got eat whatever you got. No i'm in the run. I'm in the run. I'm coming out here

5556
07:24:48,060 --> 07:24:54,299
Well, that doesn't reach

5557
07:24:54,299 --> 07:24:56,060
No

5558
07:24:56,060 --> 07:25:07,799
I'm gonna die. That's fine. She won't leave me alone

5559
07:25:08,439 --> 07:25:13,069
I mean, I I have rotten she puts it was in the worst possible spot

5560
07:25:14,750 --> 07:25:18,139
No, it's over man

5561
07:25:18,139 --> 07:25:21,659
as she landed I dodged it and I was just in it I was trying to get away from her because of

5562
07:25:24,919 --> 07:25:27,000
Oh, this is such fucking hell in this room

5563
07:25:27,720 --> 07:25:45,439
That was a really good first run

5564
07:25:45,520 --> 07:25:52,919
It's just the second round is just it's just like fuck. I mean you didn't really even get to do the second round. No

5565
07:25:54,319 --> 07:25:59,069
You walked back into it. I know but it's like it's just i'm trying to get away and

5566
07:25:59,389 --> 07:26:02,990
At the uh at the cross of the church if you go into those like big extra areas

5567
07:26:03,069 --> 07:26:06,430
She can never land on you if like we're close enough. We weren't really

5568
07:26:07,389 --> 07:26:08,270
I just

5569
07:26:08,270 --> 07:26:13,630
It's so hell bent on eating that I just forgot I did it was like it was just like I just forgot

5570
07:26:14,270 --> 07:26:18,270
That this is the worst boss they've ever fucking made and that's just hungry

5571
07:26:19,150 --> 07:26:22,189
I just forget I forget sometimes this is the shittiest thing they've ever created

5572
07:26:23,150 --> 07:26:27,470
I can't wait to smoke a fat fucking blunt with better chaos. I'm telling you it's gonna be so good

5573
07:26:31,630 --> 07:26:34,349
I don't know. I am gonna vent I am gonna vent

5574
07:26:34,990 --> 07:26:39,229
At the bed of chaos we're gonna be high as fuck and i'm just gonna be like, let me tell you something

5575
07:26:39,950 --> 07:26:41,950
Let me tell you from felania

5576
07:26:57,279 --> 07:26:58,799
He's venting

5577
07:26:58,799 --> 07:27:18,009
All right, easy

5578
07:27:18,009 --> 07:27:28,250
Oh, that's unfortunate

5579
07:27:28,569 --> 07:27:31,919
I don't even

5580
07:27:31,919 --> 07:27:35,360
Do it as you don't even I don't even know where the fuck I was. I was stuck on two pillars

5581
07:27:36,319 --> 07:27:55,159
I think i'm still old. No, never mind. I was gonna say I thought I was still in a plus one flask

5582
07:27:57,790 --> 07:27:59,790
What what plus is your flask gap?

5583
07:28:00,439 --> 07:28:02,409
uh 10

5584
07:28:02,409 --> 07:28:18,590
What the fuck? Oh, no, no, no, you mean how much actually healing? Yeah. Uh, let me see. I mean

5585
07:28:20,619 --> 07:28:29,099
Uh, anyways, it's a plus six. I have a lot more health. Yeah

5586
07:28:34,330 --> 07:28:36,990
Um, can you use the black knife?

5587
07:28:39,340 --> 07:28:41,849
Um back in

5588
07:28:41,849 --> 07:28:43,849
Do you have do you have any faith at all?

5589
07:28:44,650 --> 07:28:48,240
Nope, no, um

5590
07:28:48,560 --> 07:28:50,880
Only in our next attempt. Do I have faith?

5591
07:28:51,900 --> 07:28:53,740
All right. Let's try this one more time

5592
07:28:53,740 --> 07:28:59,240
Put on the lead grease just to keep it going

5593
07:29:04,669 --> 07:29:06,669
I don't have any lead grease

5594
07:29:11,950 --> 07:29:13,950
Skip her. Uh, we unfortunately

5595
07:29:14,430 --> 07:29:15,709
can not

5596
07:29:15,709 --> 07:29:18,319
And there's a bunch of other shit we could do but she kind of is

5597
07:29:19,439 --> 07:29:22,080
We need two great runes to go further in leyendale

5598
07:29:23,259 --> 07:29:25,259
Wait, there's another way in there

5599
07:29:25,840 --> 07:29:28,729
What's the other way?

5600
07:29:28,729 --> 07:29:31,689
Are you coming from like the catacombs? I think we're astell is

5601
07:29:32,330 --> 07:29:42,909
I don't know now. She won't drop a great room, but the game progress is through here

5602
07:29:43,549 --> 07:29:48,110
Because we kind of I don't know if there's any other game progress we can really do this is kind of the wall right now

5603
07:29:48,830 --> 07:29:50,509
uh, can you

5604
07:29:50,509 --> 07:29:57,849
Take tish and I drop it for you. Let's see. I cannot drop it. I don't have a lot of mana either

5605
07:29:58,490 --> 07:30:07,950
This is optional, but I thought there's no other aren't we kind of locked out or we can't go to the capital

5606
07:30:08,669 --> 07:30:11,369
I mean we could go can we even get to mog?

5607
07:30:12,090 --> 07:30:15,560
I think so

5608
07:30:15,560 --> 07:30:17,930
We could do bog maybe

5609
07:30:18,009 --> 07:30:20,569
Not tonight, but there's tons of shit we could do

5610
07:30:21,450 --> 07:30:23,849
The shit that we want to do was fast here, right?

5611
07:30:32,400 --> 07:30:56,330
What is she gonna do? Yeah

5612
07:31:00,650 --> 07:31:03,930
No, please don't do it. Oh, please

5613
07:31:05,560 --> 07:31:08,669
Oh, please

5614
07:31:08,669 --> 07:31:11,069
That's rough and you handled it like a champ. Thank you

5615
07:31:12,029 --> 07:31:17,790
Your chat would be parking

5616
07:31:17,869 --> 07:31:19,869
Positivity was I hope they are

5617
07:31:39,709 --> 07:31:40,990
That's rough

5618
07:31:40,990 --> 07:31:47,770
Careful. I sense it

5619
07:31:49,950 --> 07:31:53,630
There's a disturbance. I was gonna say that but I was too concentrated

5620
07:31:55,310 --> 07:32:06,169
What the hell did she just do whoa she's behind me

5621
07:32:07,049 --> 07:32:08,889
I don't know. She was there

5622
07:32:08,889 --> 07:32:11,290
She's definitely gonna fucking kill me

5623
07:32:12,409 --> 07:32:20,939
She's mad

5624
07:32:20,939 --> 07:32:47,950
Yeah

5625
07:32:47,950 --> 07:32:49,470
Okay

5626
07:33:01,310 --> 07:33:03,770
Camp oh she's behind the pillar for me

5627
07:33:05,080 --> 07:33:12,569
She's up

5628
07:33:12,569 --> 07:33:14,569
Oh motherfucker

5629
07:33:16,119 --> 07:33:19,319
Yeah, I didn't realize she was gonna instantly go for that. I thought it was the other one

5630
07:34:36,970 --> 07:34:38,970
The hell

5631
07:35:00,330 --> 07:35:02,330
Let me swing my weapon

5632
07:35:17,069 --> 07:35:20,319
never mind

5633
07:35:20,319 --> 07:35:24,000
It's I just got no I don't I think you got this

5634
07:35:25,279 --> 07:35:27,610
I have no heels

5635
07:35:27,610 --> 07:35:55,439
Do you need them? Good point. Yep, try attacking her when I swing one time

5636
07:35:55,520 --> 07:36:27,150
She swings five and I die you need a katana telling you this game should have a sniper rifle dude

5637
07:36:27,150 --> 07:36:43,930
I'm pulling the plug in like in five minutes. If only you had a faster weapon. Why do I have to play with it?

5638
07:36:44,650 --> 07:36:46,650
Didn't we didn't we talk didn't we argue about this?

5639
07:36:47,599 --> 07:36:51,520
Why can't I play with the weapon? I want to play with why do I have to play with the weapon that you're supposed to play

5640
07:36:51,520 --> 07:36:53,520
With to beat millennia not fair

5641
07:36:54,000 --> 07:36:59,880
Well, if you beat her with this weapon, then you would have beat her with a weapon

5642
07:36:59,880 --> 07:37:02,840
You're not supposed to use to beat her true. You just have to beat her

5643
07:37:05,470 --> 07:37:37,869
Like just do it

5644
07:37:37,869 --> 07:37:39,549
I don't like her over here

5645
07:37:40,759 --> 07:37:43,240
can't hide

5646
07:37:43,240 --> 07:37:45,229
True

5647
07:37:45,229 --> 07:37:48,909
And I god damn I have so little health after the respect

5648
07:37:52,639 --> 07:37:54,639
All right. I'm gonna find like an exploit

5649
07:38:04,279 --> 07:38:10,430
I I don't know be a racer. You're just a leader

5650
07:38:12,590 --> 07:38:31,840
Uh, i'm just gonna die

5651
07:38:33,119 --> 07:38:53,500
Black knife I we only have one larval tier and stirr is talking about how his build is not very good

5652
07:38:53,979 --> 07:38:56,759
No, mine is great. It's just I need a little more life

5653
07:38:57,319 --> 07:39:06,060
Uh, you can you can take it. Um, I am so scared to like you

5654
07:39:07,000 --> 07:39:09,520
Go back to faith

5655
07:39:09,520 --> 07:39:11,680
I I don't think the pizza cut is the problem. We're doing a lot of damage

5656
07:39:14,799 --> 07:39:18,159
All right. We're doing one more attempt. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I i'm done fucking

5657
07:39:18,880 --> 07:39:21,549
already left

5658
07:39:22,029 --> 07:39:32,090
I mean we could just go explore other dungeons to try to find a great run. I'm gonna i'm gonna goofed

5659
07:39:32,750 --> 07:39:39,919
You're right. Yeah, I used the the remembrance I had to get enough for a level and i'm a little bit short

5660
07:39:40,400 --> 07:39:49,720
Uh, I unfortunately don't have anything. I got enough. I got enough. Oh, yeah. I'm missing a lot of points

5661
07:39:51,240 --> 07:39:54,060
Like down 10

5662
07:39:56,189 --> 07:40:02,110
Put on more armor, I mean I have left this armor is heavy as shit

5663
07:40:06,189 --> 07:40:30,750
Disable her healing like i'll just go like full dps and you can res me

5664
07:40:32,520 --> 07:40:35,479
I mean the knife was really good. It was doing

5665
07:40:36,360 --> 07:40:38,990
Like it was just taking damage

5666
07:40:41,229 --> 07:40:42,750
It didn't seem good

5667
07:40:42,750 --> 07:40:44,750
It was but I mean

5668
07:40:44,750 --> 07:40:47,610
I would have to go back to faith. I really thought that bleed was gonna be really good

5669
07:40:47,689 --> 07:40:51,049
I mean, we're doing a lot of damage. We're getting through phase one pretty pretty much

5670
07:40:51,849 --> 07:40:57,369
Like 60% of the time very hard for me on this low of life and stamina to survive a waterfowl

5671
07:40:58,490 --> 07:41:07,770
So we absolutely could just do other stuff and level but either way, I think

5672
07:41:08,490 --> 07:41:12,090
Probably done it for the night. I mean i'm probably gonna eat my keyboard if we do this for like another hour

5673
07:41:13,049 --> 07:41:29,869
Oh risking it she going to go crazy

5674
07:41:30,990 --> 07:41:37,959
Oh fuck I got stuck. Oh fuck

5675
07:41:40,409 --> 07:41:42,409
Oh, man. Oh boy

5676
07:41:43,130 --> 07:41:46,169
I'm doing it again. Are you? Oh, that's not good

5677
07:41:46,970 --> 07:42:20,520
Two in a row look at our health. She's like back to full health. She's taking like collateral damage

5678
07:42:22,669 --> 07:42:23,869
Oh, yeah

5679
07:42:23,869 --> 07:42:31,869
I'm dead. I yeah, I we we would have to do other stuff. I I just don't have enough health

5680
07:42:32,750 --> 07:42:36,669
What if I beat her right now though?

5681
07:42:36,750 --> 07:42:38,750
I mean do it

5682
07:42:39,479 --> 07:43:11,680
I'm all for it

5683
07:43:11,680 --> 07:43:23,130
I was trying to jump

5684
07:43:23,130 --> 07:43:27,610
This is exactly what we did to plaster do six by the way. What do you what do you mean?

5685
07:43:29,000 --> 07:43:33,959
Well, we fought last to do six for like a whole night and he was destroying us and we're like, okay

5686
07:43:33,959 --> 07:43:37,639
Fine, let's go do other stuff and then we came back and it was like wow. This is really easy

5687
07:43:38,040 --> 07:43:41,159
Uh, I would rather smoke fucking three blunts with plastic do six and do this

5688
07:43:52,159 --> 07:43:54,159
I fucking hate this bus more than anything

5689
07:44:02,700 --> 07:44:04,159
All right

5690
07:44:04,159 --> 07:44:06,959
What do you say we cool off for a little bit and we go?

5691
07:44:07,759 --> 07:44:13,840
We go and do a little dungeon or something. Just just like cool off. Let's cool off in a dungeon. Let's cool off

5692
07:44:14,400 --> 07:44:17,279
Okay

5693
07:44:17,279 --> 07:44:18,240
Oh

5694
07:44:18,240 --> 07:44:24,799
I know some content that we can do. Mm-hmm. Uh, it's millennia. Hey, let's do six. Hold on passing

5695
07:44:26,240 --> 07:44:27,360
Hey

5696
07:44:27,360 --> 07:44:31,919
Anybody want anybody want millennia here? Yeah. No, no way. She sucks

5697
07:44:32,400 --> 07:44:33,919
Mm-hmm. Yeah

5698
07:44:33,919 --> 07:44:53,950
Button I voted you did. Yeah, we're going to limb grave tunnels. Yeah, I voted but it won't work

5699
07:44:56,619 --> 07:44:58,619
Can you do it right this time?

5700
07:44:59,580 --> 07:45:25,630
Now we're going up up take a nice little little little chill detour

5701
07:45:26,189 --> 07:45:28,830
The final boss is equally as hard as millennia

5702
07:45:31,799 --> 07:45:34,520
What is it? What have we seen this before? What are we doing?

5703
07:45:35,479 --> 07:45:38,860
We're doing a first dragon

5704
07:45:41,099 --> 07:45:43,099
Oh, this sounds pretty relaxing

5705
07:45:44,479 --> 07:45:47,770
Look at that big boy

5706
07:45:47,770 --> 07:45:49,529
Look at that big old chonker

5707
07:45:49,529 --> 07:45:54,619
That guy's massive

5708
07:45:54,619 --> 07:45:56,619
Now this is the now this is content

5709
07:46:13,040 --> 07:46:15,520
Ah shit, he's almost got me. Watch out

5710
07:46:17,720 --> 07:46:29,689
Claus beware

5711
07:46:33,450 --> 07:46:38,889
But

5712
07:46:38,889 --> 07:46:40,250
I don't think we got it

5713
07:46:40,250 --> 07:46:41,930
What if you dropped a great run?

5714
07:46:41,930 --> 07:46:47,130
I would say then that's great because we don't have to fucking play that other dumb stupid fucking part of the fucking game

5715
07:46:47,450 --> 07:46:50,009
Oh fucking stupid fucking goddamn fucking stupid fucking thing

5716

Come here

5717
07:46:57,229 --> 07:47:03,880
He's delaying it. He's delaying

5718
07:47:04,599 --> 07:47:21,450
He disappeared. He's right about he went back. All right, great rune of rodan

5719
07:47:22,490 --> 07:47:34,590
I got uh the glaive

5720
07:47:36,250 --> 07:47:39,000
I didn't I didn't really get anything

5721
07:47:39,080 --> 07:47:42,599
That was nice dude sick. That was that's um, that felt pretty good

5722
07:47:43,400 --> 07:47:44,759
That was great

5723
07:47:44,759 --> 07:47:47,000
Okay. Wait, what about some of the jails?

5724
07:47:47,560 --> 07:47:49,159
I know there's a few we didn't do

5725
07:47:49,159 --> 07:47:54,590
There's a ton we didn't do we did like two jails in the whole game did we do this wait can we even okay?

5726
07:47:55,150 --> 07:48:02,000
Wait, we'll look at some jails

5727
07:48:02,000 --> 07:48:04,000
This is her tree over here. We didn't do

5728
07:48:05,470 --> 07:48:06,830
Let's go

5729
07:48:06,830 --> 07:48:08,830
All right. One more relaxing battle

5730
07:48:11,919 --> 07:48:14,560
Wait, let's turn the death road in we might get a great run

5731
07:48:24,619 --> 07:48:27,500
Every item is just one item the next one that next one

5732
07:48:28,220 --> 07:48:41,599
Wait, is he gone? No, i'm here. Oh, we're not doing hero's grave. No way

5733
07:48:55,869 --> 07:48:58,159
I didn't get anything

5734
07:48:58,159 --> 07:49:16,720
Cool. All right. What is something else we can do? All right, there's the other route that goes into lane dell

5735
07:49:18,380 --> 07:49:20,060
from below

5736
07:49:20,060 --> 07:49:23,520
Which is astel?

5737
07:49:23,599 --> 07:49:25,150
uh

5738
07:49:25,150 --> 07:49:29,950
Totally don't think we were done with nocron. We could go kill the big dragon the big sleeping dragon

5739
07:49:31,919 --> 07:49:33,919
Just like a free hundred something thousand souls

5740
07:49:35,400 --> 07:49:37,400
Also true. Let's go do that

5741
07:49:37,400 --> 07:49:39,240
What if he's replaced?

5742
07:49:39,240 --> 07:49:42,750
might be

5743
07:49:42,750 --> 07:49:45,630
Uh, do you get there from here? Yeah, you do. Yeah, you can get her from here

5744
07:49:46,680 --> 07:49:48,680
I don't know where you want. I see let's walk

5745
07:49:53,419 --> 07:49:54,459

5746
07:49:54,459 --> 07:49:55,900

5747
07:49:55,900 --> 07:49:57,900
Stir I got we're good

5748
07:49:58,139 --> 07:50:00,330
What run saved?

5749
07:50:00,330 --> 07:50:02,330
Actual run saved. I just got the key to the manor

5750
07:50:05,040 --> 07:50:07,040
I just got the key to the fucking manor

5751
07:50:07,759 --> 07:50:12,240
Was it at this tree? It was at the tree. I've told you to pick that up like twice you have

5752
07:50:14,200 --> 07:50:18,200
This fucking guy. All right, but hold on. Oh, okay. We're good. Let's keep playing

5753
07:50:21,360 --> 07:50:26,000
Hey, i'm gonna go turn into a death root if you there's like a tree down there and you've been getting like good items from

5754
07:50:26,000 --> 07:50:27,439
the trees

5755
07:50:27,439 --> 07:50:30,080
Let's um get him to quiet and then

5756
07:50:30,799 --> 07:50:33,229
Uh, let's fight this dragon

5757
07:50:33,310 --> 07:50:35,310
Let's get into quiet

5758
07:50:36,880 --> 07:50:37,840
let's

5759
07:50:37,840 --> 07:50:40,319
Um, I don't think i've stood up in eight hours

5760
07:50:41,610 --> 07:50:45,610
Yeah today like i'm surprised you didn't even ask for like a pea break or anything. Yeah, let's do that

5761
07:50:45,610 --> 07:50:48,729
I haven't stood up in like seven. Holy that's actually bad. What time is it?

5762
07:50:49,689 --> 07:50:56,090
9 30, I feel like I feel like legitimately, uh, this is gamer addiction like a gamer health alert

5763
07:50:56,729 --> 07:50:58,729
uh, I need to get up tomorrow and

5764
07:51:00,040 --> 07:51:01,610
Yeah

5765
07:51:01,610 --> 07:51:04,650
Hey, I got it. I could play a bit longer, but I got a proposition for you

5766
07:51:05,290 --> 07:51:07,290
Yeah, I know that we were gonna go tomorrow, too

5767
07:51:08,409 --> 07:51:09,630
but

5768
07:51:09,630 --> 07:51:12,830
Do you want to you want to do it on monday or tuesday instead?

5769
07:51:13,919 --> 07:51:16,360
That works for me. Okay

5770
07:51:16,360 --> 07:51:19,319
Because there's a couple things that I probably need to do tomorrow

5771
07:51:20,200 --> 07:51:21,159
so

5772
07:51:21,159 --> 07:51:23,049
probably

5773
07:51:23,049 --> 07:51:24,250
um

5774
07:51:24,250 --> 07:51:27,720
Let me just make sure I get it. All right, you want to do it on

5775
07:51:29,139 --> 07:51:30,759
monday

5776
07:51:30,759 --> 07:51:33,950
Yeah

5777
07:51:33,950 --> 07:51:36,110
Yeah, this is we got the key

5778
07:51:37,520 --> 07:51:40,639
At the very minimum before we leave let's go kill that big dragon

5779
07:51:42,459 --> 07:51:50,599
We're already here. No, they're dry another dragon fight. We're gonna get like rot it. This guy wants another dragon fight

5780
07:51:51,549 --> 07:51:55,360
We just killed the strongest dragon in the game. Well, I mean, I don't mean this one

5781
07:51:55,360 --> 07:51:57,840
I mean the big one but this one this one's got way too much health

5782
07:51:57,919 --> 07:51:59,919
Oh, oh, yeah, let's go to the big one

5783
07:52:00,240 --> 07:52:08,240
This guy's freaking out. He's gonna smoke weed with the bed of chaos

5784
07:52:08,880 --> 07:52:11,639
Yeah, I got plans

5785
07:52:11,639 --> 07:52:19,209
God, I fucking hate millennia. Hey. Hey, remember when we first tried elden beast

5786
07:52:20,009 --> 07:52:24,220
That was actually pretty good

5787
07:52:24,220 --> 07:52:27,580
We got uh, we got gargoyle down here if you want. I think it's a good idea

5788
07:52:36,029 --> 07:52:38,270
Just can you just like remember for a second when things like

5789
07:52:39,549 --> 07:52:41,549
When things were nice good times

5790
07:52:43,400 --> 07:52:50,119
Hey, i'm not having a bad time by any stretch of the idea. I just millennia just just makes me irrationally upset

5791
07:53:05,520 --> 07:53:11,680
I don't like this area. I'm in where like everything does 75% of my health and damage and I can't heal it in one slap

5792
07:53:13,279 --> 07:53:35,310
Should probably get um, the horse is feeling easier run away. He relaxed man

5793
07:53:37,680 --> 07:53:46,779
nice

5794
07:53:46,779 --> 07:53:48,779
That seer that one shot me

5795
07:53:49,020 --> 07:53:51,500
At the hell I was at I I goofed

5796
07:53:52,299 --> 07:53:54,509
Okay

5797
07:53:54,509 --> 07:53:56,509
Why can I not lock on anymore?

5798
07:54:01,759 --> 07:54:04,599
Weird can't I I cannot lock on to this enemy

5799
07:54:30,520 --> 07:54:33,799
Whoa, that hurts. I thought it was just like I'm angry sound

5800
07:54:36,409 --> 07:54:44,639
me mad

5801
07:54:44,639 --> 07:54:47,119
Not locking on it's driving me fucking nuts

5802
07:54:47,919 --> 07:54:55,720
I just couldn't lock on even off the horse. Let's go to that big dragon and then i'll level vigor

5803
07:54:57,020 --> 07:55:05,849
Like two or three times

5804
07:55:05,849 --> 07:55:18,490
Even off the horse I couldn't do it. All right, let's go kill that dragon and just take the free souls

5805
07:55:19,130 --> 07:55:21,130
Did you respawn at the bonfire?

5806
07:55:21,610 --> 07:55:23,049
I did not

5807
07:55:23,049 --> 07:55:25,130
Well, okay. Sometimes I forget

5808
07:55:26,009 --> 07:55:28,009
How long it takes you to spawn?

5809
07:55:29,240 --> 07:55:31,880
Okay, the big dragon is like over here, right?

5810
07:55:34,330 --> 07:55:36,330
I don't know. I always get lost

5811
07:55:36,889 --> 07:55:38,569
I think it's down here

5812
07:55:38,569 --> 07:55:41,369
here

5813
07:55:41,369 --> 07:55:42,810
Where are you going?

5814
07:55:42,810 --> 07:55:45,610
I don't know. I think we I think we have to go over here

5815
07:55:50,299 --> 07:56:01,950
That's not that sounds right

5816
07:56:01,950 --> 07:56:03,950
There's a bonfire down here. I know

5817
07:56:10,200 --> 07:56:16,360
There was a type of guy to put gold sheets on his food fun. No, no, I wouldn't why don't we just get 62 000 souls for

5818
07:56:17,639 --> 07:56:23,549
Uh, I I I don't know you got you got lobstered you're getting lobstered friend

5819
07:56:24,959 --> 07:56:26,959
Oh getting you're getting

5820
07:56:27,279 --> 07:56:28,240
Bye

5821
07:56:28,240 --> 07:56:30,240
Just leave just leave without me

5822
07:56:35,680 --> 07:56:45,130
Okay, where did you go?

5823
07:56:45,130 --> 07:56:47,080
I went down the hill

5824
07:56:47,080 --> 07:56:49,319
The dragon fell off the bridge. Holy shit

5825
07:56:51,099 --> 07:56:57,000
Okay, let's kill this dragon get the souls level up a couple times and then i'll see you monday

5826
07:56:58,040 --> 07:56:58,919
oh

5827
07:56:58,919 --> 07:57:00,119
Okay

5828
07:57:00,119 --> 07:57:05,840
What level are you?

5829
07:57:05,840 --> 07:57:06,880
84

5830
07:57:06,880 --> 07:57:10,299
Okay, we're actually pretty close. I'm a 79er

5831
07:57:18,380 --> 07:57:21,259
All right over here somewhere

5832
07:57:22,889 --> 07:57:26,889
Uh, the game fact says that a lot of people don't fight millennia until they're level 300

5833
07:57:27,849 --> 07:57:32,139
The worst fucking boss ever made like yeah

5834
07:57:32,779 --> 07:57:36,060
I would want to go in there at a level of thousand and just click just hit her once

5835
07:57:36,860 --> 07:57:48,560
Okay, where is this?

5836
07:57:48,560 --> 07:57:50,479
um, I think

5837
07:57:50,479 --> 07:57:52,400
He he's not here

5838
07:57:52,400 --> 07:57:54,400
Where are all the yeah, all the dragons are gone, too

5839
07:57:55,439 --> 07:57:57,439
Yeah, he would normally be here

5840
07:57:57,439 --> 07:58:23,549
Just kick me

5841
07:58:23,549 --> 07:58:25,549

07:58:26,349 --> 07:58:28,349
He's not here. He's not here

5843
07:58:28,509 --> 07:58:30,590
Okay, I had this jail change of plans

5844
07:58:31,069 --> 07:58:32,110
Yeah

5845
07:58:32,110 --> 07:58:32,990
jail

5846
07:58:32,990 --> 07:58:35,229
I don't know where the fuck you are

5847
07:58:35,229 --> 07:58:41,549
I'm gonna say there's the castle at the top that has the uh

5848
07:58:42,110 --> 07:58:50,240
The dectus medallion and maybe that item is a good item. Oh, I don't know where the hell you are

5849
07:58:51,119 --> 07:58:53,119
Uh, i'm at jail

5850
07:58:53,680 --> 07:58:56,000
Over here. Where are you? Oh, there you are

5851
07:58:56,799 --> 07:58:58,159

5852
07:58:58,159 --> 07:59:01,840
You are very far away from me. Holy shit. How do we get so separate dragon is?

5853
07:59:02,720 --> 07:59:05,759
Oh, well, come over here man. We got some cool shit going on

5854
07:59:05,840 --> 07:59:11,919
You're on the other side of the fucking like chasm. Yeah, I I knew there was no dragon. That's just testing to see your

5855
07:59:12,319 --> 07:59:14,319
Gamer skills

5856
07:59:21,209 --> 07:59:25,130
Here I come here I come they're saying the dragon is not randomized

5857
07:59:27,900 --> 07:59:30,459
They can say that all they want but it's not there

5858
07:59:31,180 --> 07:59:45,740
Okay, here we go

5859
07:59:45,740 --> 07:59:47,900
100 there. I was just up at the fort

5860
07:59:48,860 --> 07:59:53,639
I hope this is easy because I have 63 000 souls

5861
07:59:58,990 --> 08:00:02,759
God free the battle mage

5862
08:00:04,200 --> 08:00:22,159
You ever just wish you could roll up into a bomb be like a roly poly

5863
08:00:23,400 --> 08:00:28,909
Actually be kind of cool

5864
08:00:28,909 --> 08:00:32,189
Like if you come across like a big hill, you're like, oh that's fine. I could just like turn into a ball

5865
08:00:33,069 --> 08:00:36,669
Can you hit him like it's some it's some aggro

5866
08:00:37,389 --> 08:00:40,509
I've been hitting him this whole time. Can you hit him like four more times?

5867
08:00:48,080 --> 08:00:50,080
He just really does not like you

5868
08:00:50,319 --> 08:00:54,490
I hope you're uh

5869
08:00:54,490 --> 08:00:56,490
Let them have it. Oh nice bleed

5870
08:01:13,500 --> 08:01:15,500
Where is this not in this front?

5871
08:01:30,110 --> 08:01:36,619
Oops

5872
08:01:36,619 --> 08:01:39,340
What's this? Wait battle mage go defroy

5873
08:01:42,169 --> 08:01:44,169
Wait go

5874
08:01:44,330 --> 08:01:46,680
I thought it was

5875
08:01:46,680 --> 08:01:52,119
Is that how it's spelled there? There is a god free that normally appears in one of the jails

5876
08:01:52,200 --> 08:01:54,200
I don't know. Maybe they call him goad free

5877
08:01:56,040 --> 08:02:00,840
I feel like you just made that up. Yeah, we got like the grocery store toy version of them

5878
08:02:02,810 --> 08:02:09,740
It's the mini boss version. Okay. Okay, cool

5879
08:02:10,380 --> 08:02:23,229
You should look at the cheat sheet in the randomizer files

5880
08:02:24,759 --> 08:02:26,759
It will tell you where some of the stuff is

5881
08:02:30,680 --> 08:02:33,880
Now that we have the manor key, we don't have to worry about it anymore. Not for at least a little while

5882
08:02:37,180 --> 08:02:41,180
Welcome to fort far off where the big dragon is

5883
08:02:43,979 --> 08:03:00,330
yeah, and

5884
08:03:00,330 --> 08:03:03,290
at the end of this we're going to get a great rune of um

5885
08:03:04,409 --> 08:03:07,549
a mesquite

5886
08:03:07,549 --> 08:03:09,470
the x-men character

5887
08:03:09,470 --> 08:03:53,950
Will you get away? Oh, thanks for the meat. Do you know the secret place to get the uh,

5888
08:03:54,669 --> 08:03:56,279
the trinket here

5889
08:03:56,279 --> 08:03:58,279
the secret place

5890
08:03:58,599 --> 08:03:59,479
No

5891
08:03:59,479 --> 08:04:07,180
I left when you guys discovered you needed the key watch the entire royal rumble pay-per-view

5892
08:04:07,900 --> 08:04:11,099
And first thing I hear when I come back is we finally have the manor key

5893
08:04:13,180 --> 08:04:14,860
mogues great room

5894
08:04:14,860 --> 08:04:20,299
Really? Actually. Yeah. Oh, thank god our next play our next time we turn this on is gonna be so much better

5895
08:04:20,540 --> 08:04:24,860
Which also we could get into landale now because yeah, i'm pretty sure the mod makes it two great runs to get in

5896
08:04:29,200 --> 08:04:34,000
That's a bit of a mogul like that's a great moment. I think it happened in the last

5897
08:04:34,799 --> 08:04:40,479
Five ten minutes of the stream. We spent we spent 99 percent of the stream fighting. I don't know what I just did

5898
08:04:41,200 --> 08:04:48,189
And then we went and did one other like side quest and like, okay, we got a great rune. That's what i'm saying

5899
08:04:49,150 --> 08:04:51,150
We're gonna go we're gonna like play for a day

5900
08:04:51,470 --> 08:04:56,669
We'll like on monday and at the end of the day at the end of the day on monday we fight malania

5901
08:04:57,310 --> 08:04:59,310
And it's gonna be like we're just gonna fucking

5902
08:05:00,189 --> 08:05:02,189
Shit down her blouse

5903
08:05:10,029 --> 08:05:15,389
Oh, you did the same thing I did you did the same I figured solidarity. Ah, thank you

5904
08:05:16,029 --> 08:05:17,740
Makes you feel better

5905
08:05:17,740 --> 08:05:24,700
All right. Well now that was fun

5906
08:05:24,700 --> 08:05:26,700
We we made a lot of progress

5907
08:05:26,860 --> 08:05:28,860
I actually think here's my prediction

5908
08:05:29,860 --> 08:05:30,900
because

5909
08:05:30,900 --> 08:05:34,180
We've got we've got to kill whatever is in rykar's room

5910
08:05:35,650 --> 08:05:37,919
And then we do the capital

5911
08:05:37,919 --> 08:05:39,919
We could potentially

5912
08:05:40,240 --> 08:05:42,959
Beat the game on monday. It's possible

5913
08:05:43,939 --> 08:05:45,939
Uh, I think it'd be pretty easy

5914
08:05:46,659 --> 08:05:49,540
because like

5915
08:05:49,540 --> 08:05:51,139
the only like

5916
08:05:51,139 --> 08:05:54,259
Terror that we have not seen is radon. Yeah

5917
08:05:54,900 --> 08:05:59,540
So if like the elden beast or any of those fights isn't radon

5918
08:06:01,020 --> 08:06:02,540
And just go fight

5919
08:06:02,540 --> 08:06:06,220
You know like the main quest stuff like that could be a mad soldier at this point

5920
08:06:06,220 --> 08:06:09,659
Who knows it really could be where the elden beast is and where horror lu is

5921
08:06:10,299 --> 08:06:13,419
It could just be something so simple. It could be like an ulcerated tree spirit

5922
08:06:19,099 --> 08:06:22,029
Yep. All right

5923
08:06:22,029 --> 08:06:24,029
Well, no, that was fun. Um

5924
08:06:24,430 --> 08:06:26,509
Millennia sucks just want to say that again

5925
08:06:27,229 --> 08:06:30,240
um

5926
08:06:30,240 --> 08:06:32,240
We'll beat her though. We will

5927
08:06:33,540 --> 08:06:35,599
I i'm confident

5928
08:06:35,599 --> 08:06:37,889
I'm also confident with like

5929
08:06:37,889 --> 08:06:39,889
10 more levels. I think we would

5930
08:06:40,860 --> 08:06:43,180
It would be so much easier with like 10 levels

5931
08:06:43,819 --> 08:06:50,130
It would be

5932
08:06:50,209 --> 08:06:52,479
Uh, right

5933
08:06:52,479 --> 08:06:57,360
Do not banish me yet. I know you want to but hold on. I mean you're banished

5934
08:06:58,000 --> 08:07:00,799
Don't do it. I'm serious because i'm about to get the treasure chest

5935
08:07:02,159 --> 08:07:04,849
The treasure trashed

5936
08:07:04,849 --> 08:07:09,439
Okay, you can ban me now

5937
08:07:09,439 --> 08:07:11,439
I can't believe that was actually a great run

5938
08:07:21,759 --> 08:07:23,200
I'm now alone

5939
08:07:23,200 --> 08:07:29,340
Well, we killed ryckard. We killed the weird version of ryckard. We didn't kill the actual ryckard

5940
08:07:30,700 --> 08:07:32,380
We killed the well we

5941
08:07:32,380 --> 08:07:34,380
Phase one ryckard technically

5942
08:07:36,430 --> 08:07:39,790
Yeah, we killed ryckard in the valiant golem

5943
08:07:40,509 --> 08:07:42,020
double fight

5944
08:07:42,020 --> 08:07:44,020
Which i'm surprised that wasn't two enemies

5945
08:07:46,770 --> 08:07:52,029
Yeah, I don't think I have anything else I can do

5946
08:07:55,970 --> 08:07:59,869
Why all there is to do

5947
08:08:01,680 --> 08:08:03,680
Is stand near fia's entrance

5948
08:08:04,000 --> 08:08:06,000
And get 10k souls

5949
08:08:06,799 --> 08:08:08,799
Could do that

5950
08:08:08,959 --> 08:08:12,159
But yeah, i'm going i'm going i'm really tired and I uh, thanks luster

5951
08:08:12,880 --> 08:08:15,119
I've just got some like backpack pork. Yeah

5952
08:08:15,759 --> 08:08:20,000
Go go relax. I feel like you have kind of a stressful last 24 hours. Go chill

5953
08:08:20,740 --> 08:08:24,930
Yeah, all right. We'll see you soon. We'll see you monday. Yeah, okay. Yeah

5954
08:08:26,529 --> 08:08:32,180
Yeah, see you monday. Yeah

5955
08:08:32,180 --> 08:08:37,580
All right. Yeah, that was uh, we made some pretty good progress

5956
08:08:38,139 --> 08:08:42,240
We were on millennia for like three hours three and a half four hours

5957
08:08:44,020 --> 08:08:46,580
It kind of par for the course. I think it

5958
08:08:51,709 --> 08:09:05,459
Before I go is anything else I can just I don't think so great stream. I didn't get too angry

5959
08:09:08,060 --> 08:09:11,580
I don't think I think this pales in comparison to when I actually played the real millennia

5960
08:09:15,389 --> 08:09:16,930
Yeah, we'll see you monday

5961
08:09:16,930 --> 08:09:21,500
Same thing. Maybe we'll beat it. Maybe we won't if we don't then we'll finish it up a day or two later

5962
08:09:21,500 --> 08:09:38,580
Imagining maybe the maybe one more weekend. Yeah, I think that's good here. I'll just call it right here. Thanks for watching

5963
08:09:39,139 --> 08:09:43,700
We'll see you on monday. Have a good rest of your weekend. Uh, there's still sunday left. So have a good one

5964
08:09:49,200 --> 08:09:51,200
and then after to after monday

5965
08:09:51,840 --> 08:09:59,119
Probably do a uh, I don't know. There's a lot of things I want to play monday at

5966
08:09:59,680 --> 08:10:02,560
Let me talk to stir probably gonna just ask them

5967
08:10:03,459 --> 08:10:11,810
Assume somewhere between two and three pm specific. That's where we'll probably end up in but yeah, take care

5968
08:10:11,810 --> 08:10:34,770
See you guys later. Uh, this stuff we still can hang out for a second. What level is my character 84 and I believe stir is 80

5969
08:10:35,330 --> 08:10:41,959
I'm gonna do some more chill stuff. Absolutely

5970
08:10:50,000 --> 08:10:52,959
Like pentament in your spare time. It's a little slow at the start

5971
08:10:54,959 --> 08:10:59,200
I think I actually tried it for like an hour and I it was a little too slow for me and I was like oh

5972
08:10:59,200 --> 08:11:01,729
This is for me

5973
08:11:01,729 --> 08:11:04,930
But I feel like I kind of didn't give it the right amount of time

5974
08:11:05,650 --> 08:11:16,209
What dead space?

5975
08:11:16,209 --> 08:11:18,209
I could probably play dead space

5976
08:11:18,290 --> 08:11:36,849
Put it on the list

5977
08:11:36,849 --> 08:11:40,849
Is the is the remake any good i've seen a lot of people playing it doesn't know if it's any good or not though

5978
08:11:43,439 --> 08:11:46,080
It sounds like I fucking smashed something in my room

5979
08:11:48,450 --> 08:11:50,689
This the cams off nobody can see me and i'm just like

5980
08:11:53,630 --> 08:11:55,150
This goddamn game

5981
08:11:55,150 --> 08:12:05,650
What about hi-fi rush? Hi-fi rush is i'm playing it just kind of hanging out off stream

5982
08:12:09,490 --> 08:12:11,330
And I will tell you it

5983
08:12:11,330 --> 08:12:14,049
It feels like it's going to be one of the one of the great ones this year

5984
08:12:18,130 --> 08:12:19,090
Yeah

5985
08:12:19,090 --> 08:12:21,490
Take it easy. See you guys later. See you monday. Have a great night

5986
08:12:21,490 --> 08:12:28,680
Take care of yourselves. See you soon. Goodbye and good night
