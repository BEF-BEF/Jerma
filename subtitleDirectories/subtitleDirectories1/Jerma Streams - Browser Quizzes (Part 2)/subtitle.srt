129
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:57,700
I know this. Hey, can you tell, can you tell that I've watched Adult Swim before? Because it's the

130
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:18,859
only ones I get. Is this Pokemon? No, it's one of the other. It's one of the, it's another one.

No, I, I am not confident. Is it? Wait. Okay. Pokemon. Digimon. Yu-Gi-Oh. Things where you like

134
00:34:14,380 --> 00:35:00,150

135
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:04,949
about the, the, the sword fighter that he fights a boss every episode and he beats the shit out of

136
00:35:04,949 --> 00:35:17,349
them. This was One Punch Man before One Punch Man. What's this called? This, this was an unbeatable

137
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:22,010
swordsman and nobody could take him on. What was it called? It was called like, oh, I know what it

138
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:28,170
is. I've seen some of the episodes. Somebody would talk shit the whole episode and he would

139
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:38,150
do two slashes and they would just die. It starts with an R. Is it like R-I-R? Like a, it's an R.

140
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:46,579
Does it start with an R? I think it starts with an R. It's like, I can't get it. Give me, I get a

145
00:36:44,570 --> 00:37:01,239
it's not like berserk. It's berserk. I thought it was like berserk. What is this one? What's this

146
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:12,619
one? This one's called Ninja Scroll. Okay. All right. This is cheating. So, I'm gonna, I'm gonna

147
00:37:12,619 --> 00:37:18,940
hit give up. This is cheating. So, I got two that I wasn't supposed to have. So, I got, oh fuck.

197
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:45,460
to guess the show based on the opening? How would I ever do that? I don't know anything about these

Oh my god, dude, what the fuck is this? Really? I ain't gonna get any of these.

You know the ones I already know. Do a geography quiz? Yeah, we're moving on from this. I don't

205
00:49:52,969 --> 00:50:00,920
don't want to do Breaking Bad. Okay, you ready? Can you name the lyrics to the Disney song with

206
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:27,860

210
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:43,340
Beside me. Take a look at this trinket and funny. Me. Up on that, up on that beach. Up on that shore.

211
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:56,949
Up on that many people galore. Makes you kind of think. Up on the, wait, hold on, wait, wait,

213
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:16,840
song. I just need another second. Um, what does he say? Under the, under the sea, under the sea,

214
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:34,250
buddy. It's the weather down by the, take it from me. What do they got? A lot of sand. What do they

215
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:56,230
got? What do they got? A lot, a lot of sand. We've got a hot crustacean band. Is it not the whole song?

216
00:52:56,230 --> 00:53:07,559
It's like the fish.

217
00:53:08,739 --> 00:53:13,059
Do, do, do the, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then, then.

218
00:53:13,059 --> 00:53:26,099
Wait, this is, there's no way this is the whole song. Take it from me. It's better down where

219
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:41,989
it's wetter. Down where it's wetter. Take it from me. Up on the shore. They talk a lot of shit.

220
00:53:41,989 --> 00:53:55,380
Back the fuck up. You're going to get hit. Um, up on the shore. They got a lot of sand, right?

221
00:53:55,380 --> 00:54:11,610
Where's sand? We what the, what? We what the? That doesn't make any sense. Well, how am I,

222
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:19,610
what way am I reading this? The, the, the up. Which way does it go? Look at the we what the?

223
00:54:19,610 --> 00:54:38,260
This is wrong. All day right up on the shore. They waste all day up on the shore. They up on

224
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:51,860
the shore. They eat all day up on the shore. They waste away up on the shore. They swim all day.

225
00:54:52,659 --> 00:55:04,099
Up on the shore. They sleep all day up on the shore. They dance all day up on the shore. They,

226
00:55:05,539 --> 00:55:11,159
what the fuck is this song? I've seen, is it resident sleepers because people want me to

227
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:22,820
say sleep or because you don't like this? I'm having trouble understanding. Rest all day up

228
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:33,909
on the shore. They dream all day up on the shore. They, wait, resident? Why would that be here?

229
00:55:35,059 --> 00:55:57,460
Sleep up on the shore. They, who? I don't know this. You dream of under the sea. On the, under the

230
00:55:57,460 --> 00:56:04,309
sea, under the sea, under the sea. Wait, do I have to write this that many times? No. Under the sea,

231
00:56:04,309 --> 00:56:11,210
we the, we got the, let me see. Let me tell you what I've got so far. The, you dream up that.

232
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:20,300
Look at the, you on the, you what? You under the sea, under the sea. It's down where it's wetter.

233
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:26,840
Take it from me. Up on the shore. They, all day, they, they, the, we under the sea. Down all the,

234
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:34,010
the, they, the, on the, they, they, the, they, uh, day, the, on the, under the sea, under the sea.

235
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:40,900
Eat, we, what, the, under the sea. We, the, we got, the, we under the sea. Do I know any other

236
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:50,420
lyrics besides just like para, whatever they call nouns? What are they called? Conjunctions?

237
00:56:50,420 --> 00:57:06,900
I, all I have is fucking conjunctions. The seaweed is always greener in somebody else's lake.

238
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:11,780
You dream about going up there, but that is a big mistake. Just look at the world around you right

239
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:18,500
here. I don't even know how the tune of this song is. The ocean floor, such wonderful things surround

240
00:57:18,579 --> 00:57:28,019
you. What? I, I, give me the fucking tune. Under the sea, under the sea. Darling, it's better.

241
00:57:28,019 --> 00:57:33,619
Down where it's wetter. Take it from me. Up on the shore. They work all day. Out in the sun,

242
00:57:33,619 --> 00:57:43,000
they slave away. While we devoting full time to floating on, okay, now I get it. Do another one

243
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:52,360
that was good. How does it go? It's like, do, do, do, do. Is this illegal for me to sing this?

244
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:06,139
Ha ha! The seaweed is always greener in somebody else's lake. You dream about going

245
00:58:06,139 --> 00:58:13,420
greener in somebody else's lake. You dream about going up there, but that is a big mistake.

246
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:25,739
I'm gonna get fucking sued. Might as well stop this now. I want to do another one. Can I do

247
00:58:25,739 --> 00:58:30,199
another one? Do they have more than these? Oh, let me do the first one. I like this. This is cool.

248
00:58:30,199 --> 00:59:00,500
All right, let's go. That's probably the only Disney song I know. Uh, my time. The, the, uh,

249
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:30,539
the, uh, uh. That's inaccurate. Find the, find the time. Find the power inside. In the, in your,

250
00:59:31,179 --> 00:59:55,590
you find the, you find the right, you find the, what a wonderful phrase. In, uh, in the,

251
00:59:56,860 --> 01:00:10,920
in that, of, and. These are the vowels. This is the Wheel of Fortune, that way you get these.

252
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:31,699
In that, and of, you find the, and the, uh, and you, uh, of, or, of, this, to, to, you find the,

253
01:00:31,699 --> 01:00:44,170
and the, and the, and the, how many times do they say the and and in these songs? Fight for, for,

254
01:00:46,090 --> 01:00:59,960
long time, long last, long last, fight for a long time, fight long roads. Why am I saying

255
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:12,059
where's long from? For, oh no, for a long time. For, uh, wait, what? For the, this, that. Think

256
01:01:12,059 --> 01:01:34,789
of something else that's not one of those just filler words. People. Um, fish. Egg. Heart. Heart.

sugar. Who the fuck is eating sugar in these movies? Why are they eating so much sugar?

270
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:12,760
Who's eating this much sugar? I don't understand why sugar pop up in half the song. Sweet. Savory.

271
01:05:13,639 --> 01:05:31,980
Eat sugar. It's a, it's a spoonful of sugar. Helps the medicine go down. The medicine go down.

full way. Just a spoon full of sugar. The medicine go down. The medicine go down. The medicine go down.

274
01:06:01,050 --> 01:06:09,269

275
01:06:09,269 --> 01:06:23,510
other lyric of this song in the most delightful way. Okay. That's it. The tang, the sweetness,

279
01:07:12,579 --> 01:07:25,019
like this song. It's because this part is spoken. It's not sang. Oh, okay. So here it comes. Here it

280
01:07:25,099 --> 01:07:36,179
comes. Yeah. Yeah. Just a spoonful of sugar helps medicine go down. Just a spoonful of

281
01:07:36,739 --> 01:07:49,690

618
02:29:19,139 --> 02:29:27,719

619
02:29:27,719 --> 02:29:36,420
swallow it as fast as i can i don't like to eat my food like taking shots of alcohol i just don't i

egg shot no you're showing free advertising for oranges what do you mean oranges what are you

624
02:30:28,860 --> 02:30:40,500

625
02:30:40,500 --> 02:30:55,290
particular about food but i only like crab legs and i don't like to eat it that often do a lobster

626
02:30:55,290 --> 02:31:00,629
review no because i don't want to that one okay why do you not eat lobster because there's only

627
02:31:00,629 --> 02:31:08,739
one part of a lobster that i like and i'm not going to buy a lobster to just eat its palms

628
02:31:09,879 --> 02:31:16,040
and not eat the rest of it lobsters number one are expensive and number two i'm not going to i'm not

629
02:31:16,040 --> 02:31:25,190
going to buy and eat and and and eat this thing to eat 20 of its body i don't want to do that

630
02:31:25,190 --> 02:31:35,139
when all the rest of it is edible and and you can eat it now if somebody has lobster or crab

631
02:31:35,139 --> 02:31:41,780
or they're like hey look i've got a lobster would you like a claw serve it up put some

02:31:41,780 --> 02:31:53,159
butter on it what about a whole chicken yeah i don't i mean i i can do that but i don't like

633
02:31:53,159 --> 02:32:01,159
to do that either now that i think about it i think it's a little different though because

634
02:32:01,159 --> 02:32:13,940
this thing i this is gonna be bad i know but a lobster no no yeah that's the difference this is

02:33:46,579 --> 02:33:52,950
telling you how i feel about the food is it a rant or is it just me talking about how i eat

643
02:33:53,510 --> 02:34:00,090
your opinion on greek food i love greek food mediterranean food is literally number one or

02:34:00,090 --> 02:34:15,180
number two i'd say it's up there probably number two uh here's my tier list uh mexican's number one

645
02:34:15,180 --> 02:34:22,620
after mexican you got mediterranean and italian that are kind of close and then everything else

646
02:34:22,620 --> 02:34:33,420
what would you order at a greek restaurant um there's lots of things i would order at a greek

647
02:34:33,420 --> 02:34:41,340
greek restaurant one of my favorite things in the world is just like a chicken shish kebab oh yeah

648
02:34:41,340 --> 02:34:53,059
it's so good chicken oh my god chicken shawarma that's another one chicken pita pita wraps euros

02:35:43,719 --> 02:36:01,500
i like a lot of different foods i just don't like a full like a lobster open it up and drink is the

653
02:36:01,500 --> 02:36:16,569
the poop in his body i'm sorry i don't want to do that does that make me a little particular why

654
02:36:16,569 --> 02:36:22,860
you always wait what do you say why do i always what why are you leaving with the food all the

655
02:36:22,860 --> 02:36:26,459
time usually you can tell the stream is ending when we start talking about food because that

656
02:36:26,459 --> 02:36:31,940
means i'm hungry because i probably haven't eaten in six to seven hours or so maybe eight hours

657
02:36:31,940 --> 02:36:45,379
so it's it's time for me to eat that's how you can tell where hot dogs for you they're high but

658
02:36:45,379 --> 02:36:50,569
they're not that high i'm one of those weird motherfuckers that i will always eat a hot dog

659
02:36:50,569 --> 02:36:57,530
if it's available every time i don't know why if a hot dog is cooked it's available and it's on a

660
02:36:57,530 --> 02:37:05,219
tray i will eat it and i mean even if there's other food items oh hey we've got this hey we've

661
02:37:05,219 --> 02:37:11,139
got chicken salad we got chicken salad and there's also a uh we've got greek salad over here too

662
02:37:11,860 --> 02:37:18,200
i know you really like um we have some some this quiche and i literally just said that because

663
02:37:18,200 --> 02:37:22,409
right here and i couldn't think of another food but if there was a hot dog as well oh yeah we've

664
02:37:22,409 --> 02:37:30,620
got quiche we've got lobster uh we've got hot dogs we've got uh pasta chicken broccoli alfredo

665
02:37:30,620 --> 02:37:38,309
and hot dogs i'll always get one i will always make room for one hot dog and then i'll eat

666
02:37:38,309 --> 02:37:43,379
everything eat the hot dog and i'll go up for seconds what do you think i'm getting for seconds

667
02:37:43,379 --> 02:37:52,790
what am i getting up there for seconds if it's available that's right i will always eat double

668
02:37:52,790 --> 02:38:01,940
portions of a hot dog barbecue we've got oh yeah we've got some uh cheeseburgers dogs uh maybe some

669
02:38:01,940 --> 02:38:06,229
fish and grilled fish on the grill i'm always going to eat at least three hot dogs even if i

670
02:38:06,229 --> 02:38:24,780
eat other stuff is this a quiz no this is the end of the stream what about corn dogs they're okay

671
02:38:24,780 --> 02:38:32,059
i'd rather have it just a regular dog just one line of mustard on it and that's it nothing else

672
02:38:32,059 --> 02:38:43,770
just one single line of mustard across nothing else and we're talking just straight up yellow

673
02:38:43,770 --> 02:39:00,200
just french's mustard nothing fancy nothing fancy loaded chili dog i'll definitely eat it you know

674
02:39:00,200 --> 02:39:05,860
it's as good uh one line of ketchup and then to make sure it doesn't fall off the hot dog

675
02:39:05,860 --> 02:39:13,930
take tabasco so you take your toasted bun your hot dog bun open it up and then take tabasco

676
02:39:13,930 --> 02:39:19,719
and put it inside the bun so it soaks into the bread and then put the hot dog on a drizzle of

677
02:39:19,719 --> 02:39:29,899
ketchup and that's how that's it it's delicious green peppers on a hot dog i've never done that

678
02:39:29,899 --> 02:39:41,479
before what's the worst ballpark food popcorn popcorn sucks why would you know popcorn sucks

679
02:39:41,479 --> 02:39:52,340
i hate popcorn i love popcorn when i make it in my own house and sit on my couch i love it

680
02:39:52,340 --> 02:40:04,739
popcorn as a going out food is awful it's awful movie theater nope you know what i do here's my

681
02:40:04,739 --> 02:40:20,469
movie theater mcdonald's order a large coke that's it just a huge at least 32 ounce coca-cola and

682
02:40:20,469 --> 02:40:27,959
make sure you piss before the movie because popcorn doesn't matter what size you get it always ends

683
02:40:27,959 --> 02:40:33,690
up the same way you get it you put a bunch of butter all over it and oh wow movie theater

684
02:40:33,690 --> 02:40:41,590
popcorn let's go your hands end up turning this weird greasy film and it gets all over your lips

685
02:40:42,250 --> 02:40:50,120
you start to get this popcorn exhaustion where it starts to taste terrible after a while you've got

686
02:40:50,120 --> 02:40:55,989
half a bag of popcorn that you're not going to eat that you haven't touched and you just it's

687
02:40:55,989 --> 02:41:00,389
like just butter and oil and it's just like this greasy flavor it's just like i don't fucking want

688
02:41:00,389 --> 02:41:08,579
to eat this anymore it's like popcorn exhaustion it happens and you end up just getting it stuck

689
02:41:08,579 --> 02:41:17,770
in every single tooth you know i had a piece of popcorn stuck in the gum up here up underneath

690
02:41:17,770 --> 02:41:27,180
my front tooth gum and it was there three or four days straight i had to go in there because i it

691
02:41:27,180 --> 02:41:34,149
was either this or i had to go to the dentist it was slid in the gum so i had to really really

692
02:41:34,149 --> 02:41:41,319
meticulously with a fingernail sit there for it but it felt probably like at least an hour just

693
02:41:41,319 --> 02:41:49,530
get it get it get it no no it's still in there finding various tools and then finally like you

694
02:41:49,530 --> 02:42:04,899
slide it down out of the gum it sucked now even with a toothpick it was hard i like popcorn it's

695
02:42:04,899 --> 02:42:13,100
just i don't like eating it at um out at places because you always have that you always don't even

696
02:42:13,100 --> 02:42:24,340
eat it it can really get bad that you have to go to the dentist and i contemplated it at least once

697
02:42:24,340 --> 02:42:29,799
you know what i was talking to holly about uh the other day which she was she looked at me she was

698
02:42:29,799 --> 02:42:35,059

711
02:44:05,100 --> 02:44:17,159
a horrible experience the nose hair that got ingrown started to be inflamed and it was painful

712
02:44:17,159 --> 02:44:24,709
there eventually ended up being a big red painful bump on the outside of my nose and over a week or

713
02:44:24,709 --> 02:44:38,950
two the nose hair that was inside my nose came out the front of my fucking nose this way this way and

714
02:44:38,950 --> 02:44:45,350
eventually it was in the i'm in the mirror and it's like oh my god and i had to pull it out through

715
02:44:45,350 --> 02:44:58,440
the front of my face two different times horrible experience i told you this is gonna be a gross
