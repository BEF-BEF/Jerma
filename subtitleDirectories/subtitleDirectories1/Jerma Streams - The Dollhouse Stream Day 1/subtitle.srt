1
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:34,090
I want anybody to see my armpits, so I'm not lifting my arms up.

2
00:11:32,860 --> 00:13:16,740
See my armpits, so I'm not lifting my arms up.

3
00:17:36,150 --> 00:20:08,220
Can't breathe without these.

4
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,200
Can't breathe without these.

5
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:36,740
Just a little too big.

6
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:26,200
Oh, a mailbox! Yay! Whose house is this? This is my house? Let me give it a check.

7
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:34,170
Are you in there? Hello? Can you hear me? Why don't we give it one more check?

8
00:29:37,529 --> 00:29:42,420
The door, I'm here! That was a voice crack in the first 10 seconds.

9
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:57,930
All right, it's not bad. It's not bad at all. I mean, I kind of feel like a dickhead.

10
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,609
Just by the way that I'm dressed, but you know, whatever.

11
00:30:00,329 --> 00:30:22,730
Refrigerator. Oh, refrigerator! Stove! Oh yes, I love stoves! Sink! Oh my god, I can't believe it.

12
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:28,089
How many rooms do I have? Just one, or do I have two? How many do I have?

13
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:40,019
Oh, is this a nice bathroom? Spacious, comfortable. I could utilize this. Toilet,

14
00:30:42,019 --> 00:30:49,319
shower, and sink. Does this sink work too? What do you think? Should we try it? It does.

15
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:58,950
A workable sink. I feel pretty good, but that could change really, really quickly. I'll look

16
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:04,630
into this one here. Take care of me. Don't fuck around. You've got three streams to do this.

17
00:31:05,589 --> 00:31:19,670
I'm just gonna go, I'm gonna go in the kitchen. Whatever. Why not? Is there anything even in the

18
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:27,640
fridge? I don't even know if there's anything in here. I see something I like in there.

19
00:31:31,509 --> 00:31:38,140
Wash my hands really quickly. Welcome to the dollhouse though. Got a few things you might

20
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:45,769
need to take care of. Got a few needs. I just saw somebody said starve him. I want that person

21
00:31:45,769 --> 00:32:07,269
timed out for an hour. So what I want to do is I, I want to go, what I want to do is I want to

22
00:32:07,269 --> 00:32:26,390
use the bathroom. It took me a while to be, how am I using my hands?

23
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:30,890
You know what? I don't even, I don't even need to hold it.

24
00:32:31,609 --> 00:32:33,529
I want to give the toilet a flush, why don't we?

25
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:56,299
That was a long one, I think. That took a little while. Hey, Jerry. Get this thing out of the way.

26
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:01,500
Do I have to wear, oh, this shit the whole time, by the way. Do I have to wear this the whole time?

27
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:15,980
I'm like on fire right now. This helmet, this helmet is making me sweat. I like the shower.

28
00:33:16,539 --> 00:33:24,519
It's beautiful. That's really what it is. And I'm taking this off because I, I, I don't want it on

29
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:32,359
anymore. I just don't, it's too hot. That's just the way it is. So I'm, I'm looking, what I'm looking

30
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:36,599
for for you to do is I'm looking for you to take care of me. Take good care of me. Don't, I want

31
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:43,299
to be, I want to sleep well eight hours a night. I feel like I'm presenting like a, I feel like I'm

32
00:33:43,299 --> 00:33:48,819
presenting a, like an infomercial. Hey, does your toilet, does your toilet do this? Does your

33
00:33:48,819 --> 00:34:00,039
toilet do this? Well it does because that means it's working. What do I want to do? This is what

34
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:09,989
happens when you, when you're just in this world. What happens is it's got a really bad migraine

35
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:13,989
that's making, I don't want to go that way though. I want to go back in the bathroom. What am I doing?

36
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:21,639
I want to take a jog. For what? I don't, I don't jog. Okay, I'm gonna, I didn't even lock the door.

37
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:27,400
I gotta lock the door. Somebody lock the door. Why am I doing this? I don't want to fucking go here.

38
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:52,340
There are cars on this road. There are cars on the street. All right, I, when can I stop doing this?

39
00:34:53,219 --> 00:35:15,960
I'm starting to stink. All right, I'm going back in. I'm going back in. I'm going back in. I'm not

40
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:30,179
wearing that helmet either. Oh wait, anybody in here? Hold on. I'm gonna have to get, I'm gonna

41
00:35:30,179 --> 00:35:39,699
have to get an electrician to look at that. Oh, I smell awful. I gotta like feel awful too.

42
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:54,389
Let me wash my hands. That was a fucking big run. All right, we can just chill. I don't have to do

43
00:35:54,389 --> 00:36:15,449
anything. I don't have to go anywhere. God, this is awful. Can I go? Why can I not, that one, I can't,

44
00:36:15,449 --> 00:36:45,260
I don't know what, that one doesn't do anything. Why? I, I, why am I going outside? Why am I going

45
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:51,619
outside? What are you doing? Hey, I don't, wait a fucking second, all right? I'm not going out there

46
00:36:51,619 --> 00:37:07,300
yet. I don't want to go out. This is a beautiful day out here. Wow. Look at those birds. This is

47
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:25,260
pretty nice. I like this. Look at these flowers. They're beautiful. I smell so bad. Take care of

48
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:39,369
me for God's sake. What about, how about another one? Going back in. That was beautiful though.

49
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:52,619
I have sweating through my clothes and I mean that in like, in real life and in fake life.

50
00:37:53,980 --> 00:38:02,940
So it makes sense that I would be like this. You'll have a series of choices. I hope you

51
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:15,780
choose wisely and when you have these choices to make, I really hope that, I feel like shit.

52
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:20,739
I hope that when you make these choices that you do them in a way that it can succeed all of us.

53
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:34,340
I think I need to fucking lie down. Um, what was I saying? I wanted to go for a hot jog or something.

54
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:44,340
I feel awful. I'm getting like a bad headache and shit. I'm like really tired. I really just kind of

55
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:52,019
want to like, that's probably, there's, over here, I think that's a good spot I sure went.

56
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:38,489
Oh, that was fucking hell. I feel like somebody just punched me in the face like three times.

57
00:44:39,289 --> 00:44:45,190
I feel like I just, I had this weird vision, this weird dream with this

58
00:44:45,190 --> 00:45:08,420
like sleep paralysis demon just surrounding me. Oh, ow, my knees. What's that? What is this?

59
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:18,420
Is this a, what was a stool? I don't like that there. That's not what that should be. I don't

60
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:24,219
like that. I don't like it. But I'll tell you what I do like. I like sassy sunglasses.

61
00:45:25,179 --> 00:45:46,889
How am I supposed to go to the bathroom in this? I am disgusting. Someone please help me. Can I,

62
00:45:46,889 --> 00:45:53,900
please just put me into a bathing scenario. I am here washing my hands desperately. Let,

63
00:45:53,900 --> 00:46:09,110
please let me bathe. Put me into a scenario where I can clean my body. Trash. Sink.

64
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:28,489
I need to clean myself. You can't just let me fucking be like this. Give me a break.

65
00:46:31,449 --> 00:46:39,750
Ah, I better, I hope that nobody comes over because this is absolutely revolting.

66
00:46:41,659 --> 00:46:45,579
What if my mother shows up? Huh? What if, what if my mother decides to come in here?

67
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:51,590
You know what she'd say? She'd be disgusted. She would put her face in the air and she would run

68
00:46:51,590 --> 00:47:05,849
away. What if my mother shows up? What if my mother shows up? All right. No, no, no, no, no,

69
00:47:05,849 --> 00:47:08,570
no, no, no, no, not with the stool there. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

70
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:17,369
okay, okay. I guess I have to go to the bathroom now. On the stool. Now I'm peeing on the stool.

71
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:35,639
We gotta poop the stool. I don't want to pee on the stool. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very

72
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:40,199
good. I can't even use that. That's supposed to be a place to sit down. That's a place for me to sit

73
00:47:40,199 --> 00:47:51,429
and relax. Can I take a shower? Can I just take one? I want to. I want to. Right now.

74
00:47:51,989 --> 00:48:02,440
I would love to take a shower right at this moment. I want to take a shower. Put me in the shower.

75
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:10,090
I'm waiting. I'm waiting to go in the shower. I don't want to go to work. I want to go in the

76
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:41,219
shower. You know, I can't go in front of people like this. Shut up, dog. I like mailboxes. I love

77
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:50,460
them. Thank God. Am I going where I think you are? Am I going where I think you're going?

78
00:48:51,099 --> 00:48:53,820
Please tell me you're going this way. Are you going this way? Please say yes.

79
00:48:54,619 --> 00:48:57,820
Don't make me like take a shit in the toilet for like a second. I haven't even taken shit yet.

80
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:00,780
Whatever. You know what I'm saying? Thank God. Am I going there? I am going there. Thank God.

81
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:17,349
Oh my God. They picked it. Thank goodness. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, this feels so much better.

82
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:22,599
Hey, look at me. Look at me.

83
00:49:43,539 --> 00:49:50,679
Well, maybe you do, right? Maybe I do sometimes. Sometimes you just got to let the water hit you

84
00:49:50,679 --> 00:50:02,619
right in the face, right in the face. There it is. That feels so much better. Oh my goodness.

85
00:50:10,179 --> 00:50:16,360
I'm not naked anymore. All right, we're good. We're good. We're fine. We're fine.

86
00:50:17,239 --> 00:50:22,469
Oh, I feel so much better. I'm fucking hungry though. If I'm not going to go to work and I'm

87
00:50:22,469 --> 00:50:26,860
not going to make money, then you got to make me food. Stupid. I should have called you stupid.

88
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:45,579
That was mean. I just want to sit over here, put the hat on. I want food and I want it.

89
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:54,860
I don't need to go to the fucking bathroom again. Something's going on with this toilet.

90
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:59,179
Something's going on with this toilet. Okay. All right. The toilet's like pissing at me.

91
00:50:59,179 --> 00:51:05,739
The toilet is effectively peeing at me and I didn't even sit on it. It's just broken.

92
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:14,199
The toilet's broken. What the fuck? I didn't even have a chance to sit on it. Oh my God.

93
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:26,380
I don't know how to turn it off. What the fuck? I didn't even sit on it. Okay. I think it's clean.

94
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:30,780
I think it's good. No, it's not. No, it's not. It's fucking still pissing out.

95
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:37,670
I've used this toilet twice. I don't know what to do about that. All right, I'm going over here.

96
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:50,230
It's just like peed all over me. I was going to use the bathroom. All right, all right. I'll

97
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:56,170
put the clothes on. Okay. Here, let's put them on. Can I just take the stupid thing out? I hate this

98
00:51:56,170 --> 00:52:04,920
thing. What am I going to do about that? I can't go to the bathroom. I need to eat. Make some

99
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:13,639
decisions. How am I going to call repairman when I don't have a phone? I'm going to have to like

100
00:52:13,639 --> 00:52:31,880
scream out the window. I need a repairman, but I don't have a telephone. If anybody in this

101
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:35,719
neighborhood is a repairman or a repair woman, I could really use your help right now.

102
00:52:38,039 --> 00:52:54,519
Fuck you, dog. What'd he say? I have a telephone, but if you could show up, that would be fantastic.

103
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:05,380
I'm starving. I haven't eaten in two days. I haven't eaten in two days. What the, who the

104
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:11,619
zoo's at? I'm feeling like faint. I haven't eaten in two days. I feel fucking terrible. Who's at the

105
00:53:11,619 --> 00:53:22,099
door? Hello? Got a clogged shitter? Yeah, I guess. Not really. I haven't taken a shit in it since I've

106
00:53:22,099 --> 00:53:32,579
moved here. So that's, I guess, technically, how much is this going to cost? I haven't taken, I

107
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:36,809
haven't gone to the bathroom. By the way, I'm sorry I look like this. It was chosen for me. The

108
00:53:36,809 --> 00:53:41,289
toilet's in here, by the way. Yeah. I don't know what's going on. It just started leaking and,

109
00:53:41,929 --> 00:53:45,289
yeah. I'm really, I'm really happy, in fact, that you live in the neighborhood. In fact,

110
00:53:45,289 --> 00:53:47,849
you heard me and you were ready to work and you had your work clothes on and you had to

111
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:52,309
buckle with you. That's really, really helpful. Yeah, it's just going. I don't know what to do.

112
00:53:59,179 --> 00:54:06,460
Yeah, it's just spraying water. Yes, it is. I haven't used it, so I don't know what to do about it.

113
00:54:07,099 --> 00:54:09,340
I have no idea what you want. This is what I'm supposed to do.

114
00:54:09,739 --> 00:54:19,639
Oh, it just cost money. How much money does this cost? There's so much water over here.

115
00:54:20,869 --> 00:54:29,929
What am I doing? What, you, I, oh my, look over there. Don't look. Look over there.

116
00:54:31,659 --> 00:54:36,219
Don't look, don't look over here. Don't look over here. In fact, get out of the room.

117
00:54:37,179 --> 00:55:15,659
No, don't. The toilet's fixed. I don't know. I didn't want to go in the shower.

118
00:55:21,429 --> 00:55:33,380
Okay. I'm fine. I'm back. I'm back. Ready to go. You motherfuckers. I swear to God.

119
00:55:33,940 --> 00:56:08,710
I'm fucking starving too. Where did, where did they go? Where is she? I didn't. I'm fucking

120
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:22,309
starving right now and I need food and I need it now. Make it happen. Thank God. Finally,

121
00:56:22,309 --> 00:56:43,380
some mac and cheese. Mac and cheese. Thank God. Finally get to eat some damn food. I guess I'm

122
00:56:44,519 --> 00:57:27,139
out of my finger. Just get some. Okay. Shit. Give it a minute. I'm not having a good time right now.

123
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:38,500
I didn't want to fucking, I wanted to pay the person for the love of God. I just want to

124
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:46,329
fucking have some food and shit. And like, I would, I'm like, feel fucking terrible.

125
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:22,650
I don't fucking care. I'm fucking not having a good time. This is good though.

126
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:45,579
I need something to do. Give me something to do. Get this hat off too. It's, it's

127
00:58:45,579 --> 00:59:02,070
constricting. I don't like it. I don't care. I'm not happy. I can't do that. I'm, I'm so stressed.

128
00:59:03,719 --> 01:03:13,460
I'm not do. I can't. It's on me. What's on me? What is that? Does it break into my fucking

129
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:29,369
apartment? Break into my house? Okay. Um, I don't hate it. I think it's kind of ugly and it smells.

130
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:53,159
Uh, okay. It's kind of comfy. I like it, but I, but I don't like it.

131
01:03:53,960 --> 01:04:06,869
I don't want to sit on a dirty bed in a dirty fucking place. Okay. I am nothing is I'm not

132
01:04:06,869 --> 01:04:12,550
having a good time at all at all. And I blame you guys. I blame it's your fault that I don't feel

133
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:18,280
good because you have so many opportunities to make me feel better. And you put, there's a mattress

134
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:24,519
and like a stool that I piss on. That's fantastic. I, whatever. I don't even fucking care.

135
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:36,519
I don't fucking care at all actually. And you guys fucked it up. Does the toilet even work?

136
01:04:36,519 --> 01:04:40,599
I don't even know. I didn't want to fucking do that stupid shit that you guys did.

137
01:04:48,820 --> 01:05:53,769
Well, it works and it works so good. It works twice. I don't have anything to make them

138
01:05:53,769 --> 01:06:10,650
do. Fuck off. I don't care. There, I made the bed for you. Any fucking way for me to live?

139
01:06:11,610 --> 01:06:30,380
Who? What? Um, who the, who are they? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, get off. No, no, no, no, no,

140
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:39,099
no, no. Off the bed. I don't want a cookie. Get, get that cookie away from me. I don't want a

141
01:06:39,099 --> 01:06:47,380
cookie. Fucking weirdos. That's hilarious. Hilarious. Get away from me. I don't want it.

142
01:06:54,969 --> 01:07:11,500
Ah, I'm in here. Don't come in. Give me your weapon. Okay. It's a little funny. It's okay.

143
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:24,389
It's a little bit funny. It's kind of funny. This is actually kind of cool. You're, you're crazy.

144
01:07:25,269 --> 01:07:36,280
Ah, I didn't, that's okay. Oh man. What, uh, what are you doing? What are you doing?

145
01:07:37,159 --> 01:07:47,960
What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? Uh, um, that's, no, no, no, no, you can't, you can't

146
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:51,800
just take whatever you want out of there. You can't just take everything you want. You can't

147
01:07:51,800 --> 01:08:03,500
just take whatever you want. Get me something I can just swing at him. I'm going outside. I'm

148
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:07,989
going outside. I'm not fucking doing this. I mean, you're funny. It was pretty funny, but please

149
01:08:07,989 --> 01:08:17,159
leave me alone. Please leave me alone. What did you do to my front door? I gotta go to work?

150
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:27,289
What did you, you motherfuckers broke my front door. I can't even fix this.

151
01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:37,609
Why am I still holding the balloon? Why am I holding the balloon still? I don't want this.

152
01:08:44,489 --> 01:08:48,729
That to go to work? I don't have to go to work, right? How much money do I have left?

153
01:08:51,109 --> 01:08:55,829
This is my, no, no, no, no, no, no, excuse me. This is my house. I'm like, why am I hiding

154
01:08:55,829 --> 01:09:01,750
outside of my own house? I'm hiding. I need to eat out of that peanut butter later. Now I'm not

155
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:08,229
going to. I'm not eating out of that peanut butter. I'm not going to work. I don't want to

156
01:09:08,229 --> 01:09:11,750
go to work. I'm not eating out of that peanut butter. I know I'm supposed to, but I'm not going

157
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:16,869
to. I'm fucking telling you right now, I'm not eating that peanut butter. All right. I'm going

158
01:09:16,869 --> 01:09:22,100
to work. Fine. Goodbye. Take this and fucking leave, whatever. They're fucking taking over. I

159
01:09:22,739 --> 01:09:24,100
wait for me. I'm going to work.

160
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:38,859
Thank you. Thanks for the ride. I know it was a little weird. I'm sorry. I know I just had a

161
01:13:38,859 --> 01:13:43,420
lot of shit going on and I'm sorry that I may have smelled up your entire car.

162
01:13:44,699 --> 01:13:50,520
It just, they're gone already, but whatever. Thank you. I'll see you again. Whenever I go to work again.

163
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:08,619
Mess. Somebody's going to have to clean that up. I just want to let everybody make sure everybody's

164
01:14:08,619 --> 01:14:13,899
wear this. There's peanut butter all over the door handles and it's actually like actually

165
01:14:13,899 --> 01:14:17,500
gross. So I'm going to have to figure out what to do about that. And this is, this is a disaster.

166
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:27,109
Great. Cookies everywhere. The peanut butter. What did he drink? This is his drink. He drank a whole

167
01:14:27,109 --> 01:14:46,539
beer in like five seconds. I'm fucking tired. I'm disgusting and I need food. Okay. They're still

168
01:14:46,539 --> 01:14:55,500
here. What's going on in there? That's funny. There's just clowns drinking beer in my house.

169
01:14:57,659 --> 01:15:04,140
Yeah. That's, that's hilarious. All right. Don't now get, move, move, move out, out, out.

170
01:15:05,619 --> 01:15:18,090
Why are they still here? I'm too tired for this shit. Get out. Move. What was that?

171
01:15:18,970 --> 01:15:31,859
Somebody got like shot. This is a mess in here. It's a mess. Am I taking a shower? Am I going to

172
01:15:31,859 --> 01:15:39,319
get in there? I'm getting in. What are the, what'd they say? Am I getting in? Oh, I'm going to get

173
01:15:39,319 --> 01:15:50,329
naked. Okay. I'm getting naked. I'm in the shower. There we are. All right. This is feeling much

174
01:15:50,329 --> 01:16:00,149
better. Please don't get the clouds out of here. I think I can like sense them. I can actually sense

175
01:16:00,149 --> 01:16:11,800
the clowns inside and somebody's in here. Don't come in. Somebody's in here. Somebody's in the

176
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:28,979
bathroom. Don't come in. That's very universal. I know it. So I, okay. Okay. We're good. Ah,

177
01:16:28,979 --> 01:16:36,010
fresh, but very tired. Very, very tired. Why is it fucking wet peanut butter on every handle?

178
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:57,109
You're not going to drink milk out of the jug. You're not going to drink milk out of the jug.

179
01:16:57,109 --> 01:17:02,630
Like that's just fucking gross. And I don't even know which one of us farted,

180
01:17:02,630 --> 01:17:08,069
but somebody did. Somebody farted. All right. Please. I'm starving. Just leave me alone.

181
01:17:09,029 --> 01:17:15,750
Take all. Okay. This is fantastic. All right. Get out of the house. Out. You're out. You're out.

182
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:24,119
You're out. Out. Out. Get out of the house. Now. Go. Go. Go. You. Help him, please. I won't even

183
01:17:24,119 --> 01:17:32,340
touch him. Just get him out. Next time, I want to stick big enough to swing. That's, yeah. But I

184
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:37,500
feel good, by the way. Thanks for the help. I appreciate it. I think somebody just said,

185
01:17:37,579 --> 01:17:49,340
red Andy. It's hot up here. All right. I need to actual like wipe these down. There's fucking

186
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:57,319
peanut butter everywhere. I'm exhausted and I'm starving. You're going to have to pick one

187
01:17:57,319 --> 01:18:06,470
because I don't know what to do. Let me just wipe the handles. He, he like got his hands on

188
01:18:06,470 --> 01:18:18,119
the peanut butter and it was just disgusting. I'm so tired. Give me something to fucking play

189
01:18:18,119 --> 01:18:25,659
with or something, please. For the love of God. It is filthy in this bathroom. There's water. There's

190
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:37,880
dirt. No, I'm not. No, I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to make a peanut. I'm not making

191
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:44,859
peanut butter and jelly. I'm not. He put his hand in that. I'm not going to eat out of that.

192
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:49,579
He actually put his hands inside the peanut butter and like he ate his with his fingers

193
01:18:49,579 --> 01:18:54,779
and put his hands back in. So I have to eat it. They want me to eat a peanut butter and jelly

194
01:18:54,779 --> 01:19:12,229
sandwich. Let me at least get the peanut butter off the handles. It's a disaster. I got to take

195
01:19:12,229 --> 01:19:18,779
the trash out too. Eventually. I got a lot of shit. Hold on. I look at all this. This is ridiculous.

196
01:19:20,539 --> 01:19:32,579
I'm going to fucking pass out too. I don't want any of this. Drinking my beer.

197
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:57,029
Can I find it? That's his finger. That's his thumb. That's a, that's a literal thumb print in here.

198
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:10,819
I literally, a sitcom audience just laughed over here. I just heard it. That was revolting.

199
01:20:14,439 --> 01:20:24,039
Damn clowns. I'm so tired, but you have no idea. I need a utensil to do this with at least.

200
01:20:28,180 --> 01:20:36,069
Oh shit, plastic, plastic, plastic, plastic. I don't want to cook this. Get this out of the way.

201
01:20:36,069 --> 01:20:44,859
Why would you cook a peanut butter sandwich? I'm not cooking. I'm not cooking anything.

202
01:20:45,819 --> 01:20:59,670
Who does like a peanut butter sandwich on the stove? I need this bad, but let's go around the

203
01:20:59,670 --> 01:21:17,960
fingerprint. Oh, I can see it. I'm just going to have a little. I need to, I got to put this

204
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:23,899
somewhere where I can actually use it here. What a sad peanut butter and jelly sandwich, but there's

205
01:21:23,899 --> 01:21:32,439
no jelly and a clown put his hand in it. This is good. Like that. It's really hot in my house. I

206
01:21:32,439 --> 01:21:41,579
don't even have air conditioning. I know there's milk in the fridge, but the clown drank that too

207
01:21:42,140 --> 01:21:53,699
directly out of the job. He ruined everything. He ruined my entire fridge. That motherfucker did

208
01:21:53,699 --> 01:22:26,500
what? This is good. I'm fucking tired. That's bringing me back to life. Thank you. I have to

209
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:43,979
pee bad though, or I don't know. I have to do one or the other. It feels much better. I need to pee.

210
01:22:44,699 --> 01:23:02,140
I need to use the bathroom. I didn't even sit down. Why is there already something in here?

211
01:23:04,739 --> 01:23:42,170
I'm not doing that, but I'm not doing that again. I'll pee in it. Okay. I'm not going to do the

212
01:23:42,170 --> 01:31:03,640
other thing. That feels better. So tired. I'm so fucking tired. Um, nothing in here. I keep waking

213
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:17,670
up to new shit in my house. Apparently not today. Everything here that was supposed to be here,

214
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:39,100
those weirdos were here, but great. That's where that goes.

215
01:32:05,689 --> 01:32:15,300
Oh, popcorn. I love popcorn maker. What? Oh, this is awesome. Popcorn. It's a popcorn maker.

216
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:31,500
It creates popcorn out of thin air. Oh, the mail too. Why is there food in here?

217
01:32:31,899 --> 01:32:46,279
Is everybody like left something? Um, okay. This is from the neighbors, I guess. Well, thank you.

218
01:32:46,279 --> 01:32:51,319
Thank you, whoever you are. I really appreciate it. Thanks for coming and fixing the toilet too.

219
01:32:51,319 --> 01:32:54,600
I know you can hear me because everyone has their windows open and everyone's ready for work

220
01:32:55,479 --> 01:33:07,319
at all times apparently. How much money do I have? I need money. What are you guys buying?

221
01:33:07,319 --> 01:33:11,479
You're buying all this shit. What am I going to do with the popcorn maker? I mean, I like it. I love

222
01:33:11,479 --> 01:33:30,579
it. I mean, I love popcorn maker, but, um, I mean, what am I going to do with this? Did you buy me

223
01:33:30,579 --> 01:33:46,020
popcorn kernels too? Cause I mean, this is cool. Let me plug it in. I don't, I, this is a disaster

224
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:55,460
in here. It's a fucking mess. I can't do anything. I don't even have popcorn kernels. I'll put it up

225
01:33:55,460 --> 01:34:06,630
here. Maybe I'll use it. Maybe I'll use it later. I can't even go anywhere. I don't, I don't like

226
01:34:06,630 --> 01:34:11,430
this living situation at all. I don't like the bed being here. I don't like the, you know what?

227
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:18,600
This is disgusting. I don't know where this is. I don't know where this is from. I don't know where

228
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:25,449
this, what this has been, but I don't want it in my house. I'm sorry. I'm just going to be honest.

229
01:34:27,850 --> 01:34:40,310
Time for work. I'm coming. Hold on a second. I got to test my doorbell.

230
01:34:41,270 --> 01:34:54,220
All right. All right. All right. I'm going to be late. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

231
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:22,250
Tough day at work.

232
01:35:30,979 --> 01:35:42,699
See you at the party on Saturday. Did I really want to invite everybody in that car? Probably not.

233
01:35:53,289 --> 01:35:57,369
Are they still out? Why are they still here? Did I leave, did I leave my phone in the car?

234
01:35:58,329 --> 01:36:13,180
What if I did though? What if I never get to make a phone call for the rest of my life?

235
01:36:14,140 --> 01:36:23,020
What if I can't make a phone call for the rest of my entire life? Right? Like I have to go to the

236
01:36:23,020 --> 01:36:27,899
fucking phone store. I got to get a new phone. I have to like call and redo everybody's numbers

237
01:36:27,899 --> 01:36:41,479
and stuff. I just, I don't want to do that. Give me this. You won't fucking.

238
01:36:41,479 --> 01:37:57,000
Okay. Can you guys buy a lock for the door? I'm not answering the door. I'm literally not.

239
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:04,859
I just, I don't have to answer the door. I'm not answering the door. They can stay out there.

240
01:38:15,779 --> 01:38:18,819
I'm not going to let them into the house because like I saw, I don't want another

241
01:38:18,819 --> 01:38:33,539
finger in my peanut bar. These are good. I'm not letting them in. I'm not sure what happened last

242
01:38:33,539 --> 01:39:04,489
time. Come on. It's really. Oh, God damn it. Hold on. Wait a minute. You can't come in here.

243
01:39:04,489 --> 01:39:12,520
You can't come in here. You can't come in here. I don't know how they got in. Why are they allowed

244
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:35,819
in the house? Why are they allowed in the house? What happened? What happened? What happened? What

245
01:39:35,819 --> 01:39:45,590
happened? Somebody's touching my face. Somebody's on me. Somebody's on me. I'm not gonna eat a piece

246
01:39:45,590 --> 01:39:50,390
of pizza with whipped cream on it. Okay. Get the fuck out of here. I'm not going to eat that.

247
01:39:50,390 --> 01:39:57,449
I'm not going to eat it. I'm not going to eat this. I don't know what this is. I don't know

248
01:39:57,449 --> 01:40:06,810
what this is. It's like a kid's school project. No, get away from me. I don't even know what they're

249
01:40:06,810 --> 01:40:18,229
doing here. I don't even know why they're even in here. Why don't I have permanent clowns? Take

250
01:40:18,229 --> 01:40:26,069
this back. Okay. I don't know what you have, but I can't see. I can't see. I need help with something.

251
01:40:26,069 --> 01:41:21,720
Please. No, no, no. I'm not taking a shower. I'm hiding. Are they gone? Oh, no. What gave it away?

252
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:44,279
I gotta find the fuse box. I gotta find the fuse box. Oh, my face. The fuse box is back here.

253
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:55,590
Close the door. Close the door. It's over here somewhere. I think I found it. God damn it.

254
01:42:58,500 --> 01:43:05,930
Where is it? It's back here in this little cubby hole. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. My fingers.

255
01:43:07,050 --> 01:43:14,840
Ow, shit. That hurt. Oh, my hand. All right. How do I get back into the house?

256
01:43:22,550 --> 01:43:29,609
My hands. All right. Out, out, out. Power's back on. Get out. Out, out of the house. Out of the house.

257
01:43:29,609 --> 01:43:32,569
Out of the house. Out of the house now. Out of the house right now.

258
01:43:33,529 --> 01:43:42,619
Now. Now, don't come back. And you're not invited to the party. Oh, God. Don't come back.

259
01:43:53,000 --> 01:44:09,699
I burnt the shit out of my hand going back there. I'm so tired. I'm exhausted. I can't. I'm not

260
01:44:09,699 --> 01:44:40,569
going to. You want to play outside? Great. It is soaking wet out here. Disgusting. I'm playing

261
01:44:40,649 --> 01:45:01,380
outside, apparently. Why do I think that's playing? Christmas time. I love Christmas.

262
01:45:05,399 --> 01:45:08,920
This is, you got to choose sleep sometimes, guys, because this is how you fuck me up for the rest of

263
01:45:08,920 --> 01:52:15,300
the week. Oh, pee. Oh, this is ridiculous. I've only lived here for like fucking four days.

264
01:52:17,340 --> 01:52:26,939
It's like a throw a party. Oh, hey. Ha ha. Make sure the doorbell works. I'm not even going to do it.

265
01:52:35,369 --> 01:53:00,939
So what happened? The popcorn machine. What's new? Oh, phone. Telephone. Finally. I can make

266
01:53:00,939 --> 01:53:09,350
telephone calls. I don't have to scream out my window. I messed up something over here.

267
01:53:10,149 --> 01:53:31,289
I ripped up some tiles. How does it work? Hello? I don't know. How's the phone? Hello. Yes, this is

268
01:53:31,930 --> 01:53:39,050
control speaking. Hello. Yes, this is control speaking. How is the spaceship doing?

269
01:53:41,829 --> 01:53:53,829
I don't know. I don't know how to use that. Wait, call. Oh, I'm going to piss. See how mom's doing.

270
01:53:54,390 --> 01:54:18,010
Hey, mom. Hey. It's just, it's, it's Jerma. Well, you know me as Jeremy, mom. Well, you know me

271
01:54:18,010 --> 01:54:24,579
as Jeremy. Of course, mom. Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm doing fine. Yeah. I just, um, I just moved in.

272
01:54:25,380 --> 01:54:31,020
Been here for four or five days or so. It's been great. It's really good to hear your voice too.

273
01:54:32,180 --> 01:54:36,659
I'm sorry. I kind of like disappeared. Yeah. I have had no way to communicate with me at all.

274
01:54:43,529 --> 01:54:49,859
Now it's very, yeah, that's funny. Wait, what did dad do? Are you kidding me? No, it's good. I just

275
01:54:49,859 --> 01:54:55,109
wish there was more electricity. I have one outlet. Yeah. I've never heard of a house before that had

276
01:54:55,109 --> 01:55:06,649
one outlet, but you know, this plumbing, it works. It's comfy. It's cozy. Mom, I, uh, it's been really

277
01:55:06,649 --> 01:55:11,050
good to hear your voice, but I definitely have to go. Uh, I've got to go. I've got to get off the

278
01:55:11,050 --> 01:55:17,449
phone and yes, yes, I've got to go. I've got to go. I've got to get off the phone. I've got to get

279
01:55:17,449 --> 01:55:20,569
off the phone. If we're going, I'm, I'm going to go pee with you on the phone and I'm going to

280
01:55:20,569 --> 01:55:32,680
hang up after goodbye. Mom, it's not just gonna see you. I'm not gonna, I'm not going to piss or

281
01:55:32,680 --> 01:55:42,140
like shit on the phone with my mother. I'm sorry. Like you picked it too late. There you are. Not

282
01:55:42,140 --> 01:55:51,750
going to happen. Ah, it feels pretty good. That was a good call though. Good. It's good to talk

283
01:55:51,750 --> 01:56:06,500
to my mom. Ah, it feels good now. Life is good. I feel good. I feel like I look good.

284
01:56:07,220 --> 01:56:16,649
Too much stuff though. I just, I wish I could just get rid of this stuff.

285
01:56:17,369 --> 01:56:22,760
Do you see what happened over here? This is, this is a slice of pizza here with like whipped cream

286
01:56:22,760 --> 01:56:28,380
on it. I don't want that. I want to get rid of it. I don't want that. I'm in my house anymore.

287
01:56:29,100 --> 01:56:49,819
Time to go to work. Let's go. Be there in a sec. Time to make some money.

288
01:57:56,810 --> 02:01:26,380
Bye. Bye. Thank you for the ride again.

289
02:01:59,640 --> 02:02:14,699
Tired, hungry, all the above, all of the above. Ridiculous. That was a rough day at work too,

290
02:02:15,670 --> 02:02:34,489
but I made some money, you know, and that's the good thing. That feels better. Oh my goodness.

291
02:02:34,489 --> 02:03:01,699
I feel like a thousand dollars more than I did earlier. Oh, thank God. I'll have some of this.

292
02:03:07,720 --> 02:03:45,539
If I can even get it in, it doesn't do anything. You know what? I'm going to have some cereal.

293
02:03:54,789 --> 02:04:13,930
Cereal sounds good to me. Am I peeing? What? Am I peeing? What happened? Why was I just peeing?

294
02:04:19,670 --> 02:04:34,340
Oh, it was a sizzle. I was like, why am I pissing? All right. I think, wait, shower. I'm not done.

295
02:04:44,600 --> 02:05:00,869
I can't take a shower with the food. All right. Maybe I can. Oh, it's getting all in there. It's

296
02:05:00,869 --> 02:05:09,050
getting all soggy. It's all getting soggy. That was like Peter Griffin. I just realized that.

297
02:05:10,439 --> 02:05:17,029
It's getting soggy. Oh, but killing two birds with one stone though. This is good.

298
02:05:34,380 --> 02:05:59,670
Starting to feel better. Life's coming back. Life is coming back into me.

299
02:06:05,060 --> 02:06:55,699
Oh, I'm just tired. Unhappy. What? What's in the mail? What? I got a piece of mail. What's it say?

300
02:07:01,380 --> 02:07:15,050
$500. An inheritance. $750. I misread it in my glasses. $750 from Dear Uncle Ted. No way. What an

301
02:07:15,050 --> 02:07:35,399
inheritance. What did he leave me? His weight set? Was that rain? That's a huge deal. All right.

302
02:07:36,420 --> 02:07:52,329
That's money. That's big money. I was sad before, but that's another $750. How much money do I have

303
02:07:52,329 --> 02:08:03,380
in my bank now? How much money have I got? Do I have more than $500? Like $1,200? Holy shit.

304
02:08:03,859 --> 02:08:46,710
This floor is filthy. Hello? Mom? Yeah. I know. I heard about Uncle Ted. Yeah. Yeah, I know. He

305
02:08:46,710 --> 02:08:56,180
sent me some. Did he send you anything? No. Yeah. I got $750 in an envelope. It was a check, but

306
02:08:56,180 --> 02:09:08,390
still. How are you doing? Yeah. Yeah. No, I mean, it's really nice of him. What did he give you?

307
02:09:09,109 --> 02:09:19,699
You got $10,000. That's awesome. Hell yeah. That's awesome. Well, that's sad, but I got money.

308
02:09:22,279 --> 02:09:29,289
When did he send it? Why would he send it? Oh, his inheritance. That's right. That's right. That's

309
02:09:29,289 --> 02:09:37,159
right. So it was split up across the whole family. Oh, there's a house too. Wow. That's very

310
02:09:37,159 --> 02:09:43,350
interesting. Yeah. Yeah. I know. That's sad. Well, I mean, he left some stuff for everybody.

311
02:09:43,350 --> 02:09:52,920
It's really cool. It's really nice of him. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'll talk to you soon. Yeah. All

312
02:09:52,920 --> 02:10:04,260
right, ma. All right, ma. Yeah. Yeah. We'll figure it out. Yeah. Love you too. That's right. That's

313
02:10:04,260 --> 02:10:07,140
what you say. You love you to your mother. You haven't talked to your mother lately?

314
02:10:07,140 --> 02:10:13,770
Say call her and say, I love you. Do it. You do it. Do it tonight. Don't wait. Mother's important.

315
02:10:13,770 --> 02:10:32,920
She's very important. Right in the bed. Finally. The first night I've actually been able to sleep

316
02:10:32,920 --> 02:10:40,020
in the bed. It's been a very long, that was the mattress that I, that was the mattress. That wasn't

317
02:10:40,020 --> 02:10:46,840
me. That was the mattress. It's like the fart stream. It's the fart stream. I got to get comfy.

318
02:10:46,840 --> 02:17:27,860
Hold on. That was pretty, that was not bad for the first time ever being able to sleep on this bed.

319
02:17:27,860 --> 02:17:43,379
Uh, I feel a little groggy, but it's okay. I didn't have one of those weird sleep paralysis

320
02:17:43,379 --> 02:18:04,540
dreams. Not last night. Filthy. I hate it in here. I can't even be in here. I literally cannot even

321
02:18:04,540 --> 02:18:34,709
be in this room. What? I don't know. What happened? Can I at least get rid of some of this stuff?

322
02:18:35,350 --> 02:18:45,989
It's ridiculous. It's, that's just, no. I'm cleaning up a little just to be able to walk around again.

323
02:18:45,989 --> 02:19:26,620
What? It looks very broken from what I can tell. Am I gonna, can I even go to work? I don't think

324
02:19:26,620 --> 02:19:40,569
I can even go to work if you wanted me to. I'm going, I'm going out the window. I'm going out

325
02:19:40,569 --> 02:19:47,190
the window. I can't, you didn't close the window. I'm going out the window. Yeah, I'm going out.

326
02:19:58,520 --> 02:20:19,479
Seeing fucking Ace Ventura when he's coming out the rhino's ass. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Hey, yay, bed.

327
02:20:22,180 --> 02:20:40,389
Bed. I love, I love what you've done with the bed. Why does everything have to go in the yard?

328
02:20:41,110 --> 02:20:52,149
You have to put everything in the yard? Any mail today? No. Well, at least I can, I'm not climbing

329
02:20:52,149 --> 02:20:57,190
back in, so send me to fucking work, okay? I'm not gonna, I'm not climbing, I'm not gonna climb back

330
02:20:57,190 --> 02:21:11,059
in the window. I'm going to work. I'm not climbing back in. I could sit on it though. I could hang out

331
02:21:11,059 --> 02:21:21,219
on it. The side just sunk. Oh, that's what this is for. That's what fell out. That was the very

332
02:21:21,219 --> 02:21:35,510
loud noise that I heard. I heard an incredibly loud sound. This bed is fucked. I wouldn't, I'd rather

333
02:21:35,510 --> 02:21:54,899
lie on the dirty one. I'll be honest. What, I got mail? What's the mail? I got a hundred dollars

334
02:21:56,549 --> 02:22:05,879
from Dolls R Us for the thing I left at the shop. I had a consignment. Well,

335
02:22:06,680 --> 02:22:16,760
cool. All right, more free money. I'll take free money. Should I go to work too? Send me to work.

336
02:22:19,739 --> 02:22:25,829
I can't, I, I'm not, I literally, nothing else I'm gonna do out here. I'm not, I'm gonna have to use

337
02:22:25,829 --> 02:22:44,500
the bathroom too. Feeding, feeding you money so you can make the right decision. I don't think I

338
02:22:44,500 --> 02:22:58,149
could even put this together if I wanted to. That's the last part of the day. If I hear the

339
02:22:58,149 --> 02:23:04,200
fire, I'm coming over there. I swear to God. Oh, it's just the bottom. All right. Now I can,

340
02:23:04,200 --> 02:23:10,899
no, this is a fucking, this is a train wreck under, but wait, this is an air mattress.

341
02:23:11,860 --> 02:23:17,979
This is not even a bed. Look at what happened under here. What happened under, look at this.

342
02:23:18,780 --> 02:23:25,959
Do you see what I have to deal with right now? This is, I can't put this together.

343
02:23:26,600 --> 02:23:39,219
I'm going to sleep on it like that. It's just absolutely destroyed. I don't know if you guys

344
02:23:39,219 --> 02:23:43,700
can hear it, but it was seriously, it was like, it was like an explosion back here. Like it just

345
02:23:43,700 --> 02:23:56,329
fell apart in their hands. Work. Oh, is it time for work? I see the car pulling up. Hey, pick up this

346
02:23:56,329 --> 02:24:09,590
guy. You know what I'm saying? Car. Are they on the road? I don't even hear them. Oh, there you are.

347
02:24:09,590 --> 02:24:12,549
Don't worry about what you see over here, by the way. Just don't,

348
02:24:12,549 --> 02:24:14,709
don't drive far enough to see by my driveway.

349
02:24:17,430 --> 02:24:53,780
Let's go. Yeah, it was a dick move. No, that was a dick move. What you did. Not everybody,

350
02:24:53,780 --> 02:24:56,100
not everybody thinks that's funny. So I just want to let you know,

351
02:24:56,100 --> 02:24:58,100
but we'll see you at the party on Saturday. He's still going to go.

352
02:25:05,180 --> 02:25:15,129
I can't, I got to pee bad. You know, it's funny, even if I wanted to move this,

353
02:25:15,129 --> 02:25:22,489
I wouldn't be able to. I'm not going through the window. That hurt. Even if I wanted to move this,

354
02:25:22,489 --> 02:25:38,940
it would be hard for one person. I don't know what to do. I need to get in there.

355
02:25:41,690 --> 02:26:29,940
What do I do? Help. Hey, excuse me. Excuse me. Help me. Excuse me. Help. Right. There's a water

356
02:26:29,940 --> 02:26:37,940
fountain over there that I hear. I heard a water fountain. Hey, I wonder if it flushes.

357
02:26:47,739 --> 02:26:59,479
That's so stupid. Oh, I'm not having a good time though. Give me something to play with. It's so

358
02:26:59,479 --> 02:27:08,520
much fun. I wouldn't go back in there, but I just don't want to go in the window. Will this fit over

359
02:27:08,520 --> 02:27:17,209
me? No, I don't think so. I could go like this. No, this is kind of fun what I'm doing, but not

360
02:27:17,209 --> 02:27:28,379
really. This actually could be a hat, but somebody just said it could be a toilet seat. It's not

361
02:27:28,379 --> 02:27:34,040
going to be that. I'm not going to use this as a toilet seat. Oh, this is kind of a funny hat.

362
02:27:34,040 --> 02:27:46,600
This is a funny hat. I like it. This is a funny hat. I can't even block the door. I could very

363
02:27:46,600 --> 02:28:04,569
easily just get in there. I could, but make food. I can't. Can I eat these flowers edible?

364
02:28:05,370 --> 02:28:15,559
I don't think I can even. Can I eat one of these? What happens to my hunger level if I eat one of

365
02:28:15,559 --> 02:28:32,969
these? Hold on. Let me see. Ow. It's like stung me. All right. What if I take like a bite? I'll take

366
02:28:32,969 --> 02:28:54,219
a big bite. It's not good. I can't go. All right. I'm climbing the window again. No, I don't want to

367
02:28:54,219 --> 02:29:09,780
climb in the window because then I won't get the comfortable bed. No, I don't want to get hurt.

368
02:29:09,780 --> 02:29:18,889
This is day one. Oh, shit. But these have been out here for like five days.

369
02:29:20,579 --> 02:29:27,739
Haven't these been out here for like at least five days, right? Can I actually eat these or is that

370
02:29:27,739 --> 02:29:38,229
going to be bad for like, what if I just pretend to? I don't know how long these actually have been

371
02:29:38,229 --> 02:29:55,270
here for. Now I've had another bite. Ooh, that was really good. I want to just like jump in.

372
02:30:06,709 --> 02:30:19,500
What? What are you doing? You want me to run? Run? Run away. Like now. You want me to run away?

373
02:30:23,350 --> 02:34:35,350
That, that's like run down the street. I can't get back inside. That's very obvious.

374
02:34:35,350 --> 02:34:42,010
This is a nice house. How am I going to get back in here? Run away? I've been walking around the

375
02:34:42,010 --> 02:34:46,229
neighborhood for the last like six hours. You know, people have come out and just looked at

376
02:34:46,229 --> 02:34:52,180
me and been like, what the hell is this guy doing out here? Seems you have chosen to upgrade the

377
02:34:52,180 --> 02:35:02,729
house. And what does that mean? That means that that is the end of the tutorial. So thank you for

378
02:35:02,729 --> 02:35:07,129
playing in our tutorial version of this game. Hopefully it worked out pretty well. I think it

379
02:35:07,129 --> 02:35:19,879
did. And in two days, that is where the real game starts. So I, this was a ton of fun. Let me look

380
02:35:19,879 --> 02:35:24,440
at the right camera right here. There we are. I had a ton of fun. Thanks for watching everybody.

381
02:35:24,440 --> 02:35:32,520
Special huge, huge, huge scam. Well, I want to say thanks everybody for watching. We have two more

382
02:35:32,520 --> 02:35:39,239
streams of this and it's going to get even more wild. We're literally going to dial it even higher

383
02:35:39,239 --> 02:35:44,280
and higher every day. So I keep talking to the wrong cameras. I don't know what's wrong with me.

384
02:35:45,079 --> 02:35:49,239
We're going to dial it up every day. Every single day it's going to get more ridiculous.

385
02:35:49,959 --> 02:35:54,280
So we want to make sure that everything worked as intended before we got started.

386
02:35:54,920 --> 02:36:01,879
So I cannot actually get into this house. So I'm not going to even try. Trial version of

387
02:36:01,879 --> 02:36:08,360
full game unlocked. Special huge thank you to Twitch for partnering with us and to Coinbase.

388
02:36:09,540 --> 02:36:14,020
Without them, this would never have happened. And there's way more to see over the next two

389
02:36:14,020 --> 02:36:19,780
or three days. So what that means you'll see in the next few days, but we got everything.

390
02:36:20,340 --> 02:36:27,719

But yeah, I'm really, really happy. I really think that everything worked out pretty well in

02:36:33,379 --> 02:36:39,059
this kind of tutorial version of the game. So I'm very, very excited. I hope you had fun.

02:36:39,059 --> 02:36:43,219
We got a lot of data. So we got a lot of things that we might have to work on and check out and

394
02:36:43,219 --> 02:36:50,870
see how they played out. But for the most part, I think it was pretty fun. So we'll see. So we'll

395
02:36:50,870 --> 02:36:59,819
see with the upgraded house in a couple of days with even more wacky, wild stuff. Thank you,

02:36:59,819 --> 02:37:05,209
everybody. We'll see in a couple of days. Thanks for playing the tutorial. I can't go back in there.
