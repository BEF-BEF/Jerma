1
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:27,429
See, I'm here. I turned it on. I turned it on.

2
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:30,550
Yeah, we were troubleshooting. We were making sure we could get in the party,

3
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:36,520
and that we could get everything ready, and yeah. I'm here.

4
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:43,479
Hi. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna leave. I'll be right back. I forgot to make a coffee.

5
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:47,609
Everyone's just starting their streams now, or we're getting ready.

6
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:48,969
Let me go over what's happening today.

7
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:52,939
Hi. We're gonna be playing some Man vs Machine.

8
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,789
Team Fortress. Something I've been kind of wanting to do for a few months,

9
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:01,509
I feel like, at least six or seven weeks.

10
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:06,069
We've got a crew. This is the crew that we've been

11
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:08,950
kind of communicating for the last month or so about this.

12
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:20,840
Sans one person, but we have Dug Dug, Ludwig, Poke, Stir, and Vinny Vinesauce.

13
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,030
Quite the crew. And me!

14
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:29,109
Yeah, should be fun. Looking forward to it.

15
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:35,909
I have not... I tested this last night, but I've not really gone completely into

16
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:38,870
Man vs Machine in years. It's been at least five years.

17
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:45,510
So I'm excited to at least play it, fill out a party, have some fun.

18
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,540
Yeah, give me one second. I'm gonna be right back.

19
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,060
I'm gonna just make my coffee, and I'm gonna be the last one that comes back, probably.

20
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,780
So when everyone's making fun of me and calling me all kinds of names,

21
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,980
just remember I'm getting a coffee, and you can communicate that.

22
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,260
All right, I'll be right back.

23
00:02:01,260 --> 00:03:46,870
I am back. Check on everybody else.

24
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:51,449
Is anybody here?

25
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,139
Forgot there's only six guests. Oh, hello!

26
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:56,060
Hey! Oh, perfect timing.

27
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,080
How you doing?

28
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,879
Good.

29
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:58,759
What's happening? How you doing?

30
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,039
I'm nervous.

31
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:01,879
Don't be. We'll be fine.

32
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:03,960
I've never played before.

33
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:06,340
Okay.

34
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:06,740
Hello.

35
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,900
Let's help Ludwig out.

36
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,020
Okay.

37
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,379
What if I'm bad, Jerma?

38
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:12,740
You won't be bad. I promise.

39
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,180
What if I get the team killed?

40
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,620
Well, that's gonna... people are gonna do that on purpose to you anyways.

41
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,110
What?

42
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,389
It's gonna be like a funny ha-ha.

43
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:20,949
Funny we got you.

44
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:22,149
I'm already stressed out. Don't do that.

45
00:04:22,149 --> 00:04:23,110
That's not a funny ha-ha for me.

46
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,069
It's a stressful ha-ha.

47
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:26,899
Okay, so the Scout.

48
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,060
He's the first class.

49
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,660
He runs really fast.

50
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,819
He has Bonk Atomic Punch.

51
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:34,980
When he drinks it, he becomes invincible.

52
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,939
Very important to know.

53
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,220
The Soldier.

54
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,339
Can I ask you a question?

55
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:38,579
Yeah.

56
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:41,139
Without... because I don't need to know the classes.

57
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:44,019
I just want to know what you think I am.

58
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:45,540
Just, like, soak me in.

59
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:49,560
Hmm.

60
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:50,680
Interesting.

61
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,680
He's the first member of the DK crew.

62
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,879
So I would go Lanky Kong.

63
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,079
Okay?

64
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:55,959
Okay.

65
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,529
I know I'm being helpful right now, but...

66
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:00,730
People are saying Pyro.

67
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,569
People are saying that you're probably a Pyro.

68
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,720
Well, I'm a Pyro, so...

69
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,519
Or a Heavy.

70
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:07,959
Heavy Weapon Guy could be good.

71
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,399
Why are we talking about this like it's...

72
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,920
like astrology?

73
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,199
It feels like a sorting hat.

74
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,079
Like Harry Potter.

75
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,040
Like, oh, are you a Virgo?

76
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,120
Wait, I'm gonna do a BuzzFeed quiz.

77
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:22,920
Really?

78
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,519
Yeah, BuzzFeed.

79
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,720
What TF2 character are you?

80
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,480
All right, well, let's see.

81
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:27,959
Let's hear it.

82
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,889
Are there more than five questions on that list?

83
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:33,529
Which...

84
00:05:33,529 --> 00:05:35,129
There are 14 questions.

85
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:36,490
It is quite thorough.

86
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,290
Yeah.

87
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,889
I'll link the one I'm looking at here.

88
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:42,550
Um, okay.

89
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,350
I'm gonna go through this.

90
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,949
I'll tell you what agent I get in a bit.

91
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:47,189
I kind of feel like you're kind of a spy too, though.

92
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:47,670
Don't you think?

93
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,899
Mission begins in 30 seconds.

94
00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:55,980
The first round of a payload map is starting.

95
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,540
You loaded late and everyone else has picked a team.

96
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,500
The game is 8v8.

97
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,699
Which team do you choose?

98
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:02,220
These are really detailed questions.

99
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,579
Yeah, these are a lot of answers.

100
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,819
These questions are also based on TF2 gameplay.

101
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:09,819
Okay, also, I don't want to make anybody upset or anything,

102
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:13,220
but while we're hanging out, I've got a few crates to open.

103
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:17,850
I'll get off of some crates just while we're just sitting,

104
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:18,810
we're just hanging out.

105
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,620
We're just hanging out.

106
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,139
I know why you live in Vegas now.

107
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:23,990
Yeah.

108
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,550
Makes sense.

109
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,189
Yeah, it makes sense.

110
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:31,430
Okay, so I do need help while we wait for the other three to be ready.

111
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,670
I have a ton of cases in crates.

112
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,579
I opened up some before.

113
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:37,019
Should I even open these?

114
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:38,300
Or are these dog shit?

115
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,019
I don't know.

116
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:40,300
I have no idea what's in these.

117
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,129
Are these stupid?

118
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:48,540
Should I not open these?

119
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,180
Open them.

120
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,139
Yeah, but which one?

121
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:54,870
Because I know that some of the crate series are terrible, right?

122
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,230
83 is good.

123
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,910
If you guys have no idea what I'm talking about in the call,

124
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:02,389
TF2 invented the idea of opening boxes for items.

125
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,350
And the world has been worse ever since.

126
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,910
It's all their fault.

127
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,939
But hey, kind of fun.

128
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:09,980
Let's do it.

129
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,310
All right, 83.

130
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,269
All right, I'm going for it.

131
00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:15,480
Let's go 83.

132
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:20,310
Unusual right now.

133
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:25,529
All right, I already have one of these.

134
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,089
We opening boxes?

135
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,220
Just to kill some time.

136
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,339
I only have a few.

137
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:33,750
Not just to kill some time.

138
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,269
Just fucking throwing some keys in these crates.

139
00:07:37,269 --> 00:07:42,970
All right, is it weird that I want the strange flog item?

140
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,170
I want to open that one.

141
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:52,100
Strange flog, come on.

142
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:58,089
Oh, holy shit.

143
00:07:58,089 --> 00:08:00,620
But why do you have evil villain hair?

144
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,220
I told you I'm trying to be as gross as possible.

145
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:12,600
I'm trying to grow my hair up like a long and just be fucking disgusting.

146
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,319
Just one crate.

147
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,680
They want me to open crates now.

148
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:14,920
I'm not.

149
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,720
I don't want to do not do not.

150
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,319
There's no don't.

151
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,120
It's just.

152
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,029
Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of cool.

153
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:24,389
I've got a lot of items, Jerma.

154
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:27,029
But a lot of this is like classic stuff or stuff people gave to me.

155
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:28,790
So I'm good.

156
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,899
Is that OK?

157
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:33,879
And Ludwig has literally all the stock items.

158
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:35,000
Yeah, it'll be fine.

159
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:37,480
He'll get some while we're playing.

160
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,669
No, that's true.

161
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:39,909
All right.

162
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:40,789
What about this one here?

163
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:41,990
This like spider one.

164
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,870
I'm going to open this one.

165
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:45,110
Yeah.

166
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:49,289
And I was a little I wanted to make it nice looking.

167
00:08:49,289 --> 00:08:52,629
I matched it.

168
00:08:52,629 --> 00:08:57,480
Chad, this is not a great little mask.

169
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,279
That's pretty.

170
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,240
Oh, OK.

171
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,200
That's pretty cool.

172
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,190
All right.

173
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,429
Are we am I like just wasting time?

174
00:09:03,429 --> 00:09:03,909
Are we OK?

175
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:05,190
Are we like just still hanging out?

176
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,669
Everyone's doing an intro still, I think.

177
00:09:07,669 --> 00:09:07,909
All right.

178
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:11,269
I'm just making sure that I'm not like everyone's like, what the fuck is he doing?

179
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:12,470
I thought we went to play man versus machine.

180
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,429
He's opening crates.

181
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:17,139
Now they're all doing their own thing.

182
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:23,320
Yeah.

183
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,480
Give me an unusual.

184
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,039
What is that?

185
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,440
Cabinet man is like a little game.

186
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,759
Do I have to buy keys now?

187
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:35,320
God damn it.

188
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:40,360
I was just going to double.

189
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,480
Wait, what did I get?

190
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,860
Oh, it's Halloween only.

191
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,419
OK.

192
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:50,789
Who's this for?

193
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:55,590
Engineer.

194
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,149
No, check.

195
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:56,870
It's going to be great.

196
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,830
Give me give me a minute here.

197
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,269
Let me buy a couple of keys.

198
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:01,269
That's actually fucking awesome.

199
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:05,690
I wish I could have this on right now, but I can't.

200
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,090
Are you?

201
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:06,809
Oh, yeah.

202
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:08,889
I mean, just make sure you don't do that on camera.

203
00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:09,289
Oh, I know.

204
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:09,529
I know.

205
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:09,929
I know.

206
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:11,100
Yeah.

207
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,299
Yeah.

208
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:14,299
Don't don't show them how much how much you're buying.

209
00:10:14,299 --> 00:10:17,559
Make it a mystery.

210
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:18,279
That's amazing.

211
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:19,429
I love it.

212
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:19,590
Yeah.

213
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,230
What's going on?

214
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,110
We're buying cases.

215
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:26,389
I just had a few left over while people were doing intros.

216
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:30,840
What's a what's a rare case that I wish I knew?

217
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,139
There's like there's like 200 of them at this point.

218
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:34,779
It won't let me.

219
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:35,500
I bought the keys.

220
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,100
It won't let me open the case.

221
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,830
Did you buy the right keys for the right case?

222
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:40,950
Oh, you may have not.

223
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,149
Oh, fuck.

224
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:44,070
You may have bought incorrect keys.

225
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:44,549
Oh, no.

226
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:48,919
I knew I knew I was going to do something wrong.

227
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,620
Oopsie.

228
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,750
Yeah, there's there's a million different keys.

229
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,029
Yeah, they did.

230
00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:00,019
Why did they do that, by the way?

231
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:02,070
Uh, I don't know.

232
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:02,789
I wish they did.

233
00:11:02,789 --> 00:11:05,509
They're like not even in my inventory with the keys.

234
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:07,590
What happened?

235
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,149
All right.

236
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:08,789
Whatever.

237
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:09,909
This is silly.

238
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:11,750
This is all silly business.

239
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,590
I have a pending item alert.

240
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:18,629
If you bought them from the market, then you would have to, like, accept the alert.

241
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:20,629
Uh, you might need to restart your game.

242
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:24,009
It's possible, you know, also possible.

243
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:26,970
I don't want to leave the party.

244
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,250
So, oh, Doug just went offline.

245
00:11:29,049 --> 00:11:31,700
If you leave the game, you don't leave the party.

246
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,820
OK, I'll try.

247
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,860
I'll give it one shot.

248
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:40,659
Let's see if I get a good item here, because, you know, my chat is like desperate for me

249
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:41,860
to like open items now.

250
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:53,379
What the summer of September?

251
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:55,779
Yes, that's when the event is over.

252
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:58,649
Oh, I like that.

253
00:11:58,649 --> 00:11:59,450
I already have this.

254
00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:03,100
I already have that.

255
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,059
No, I don't chat.

256
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:05,100
I got the keys.

257
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,190
I think I hope these are the right ones.

258
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:09,429
Fuck.

259
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,029
They're still not the right ones.

260
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,649
Is this just like Twitch streamers?

261
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:18,009
They get together for a fun night of games, and then everyone just sits around and gambles

262
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:18,730
for like an hour.

263
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:22,730
Like, but not even gambling, like, appropriately.

264
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,490
Like, I'm failing at gambling.

265
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,009
And then we all go to bed at eight.

266
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:29,690
Can you imagine, like, going to Vegas, going to the blackjack table and like, sorry, you

267
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:30,809
don't have the right key.

268
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:33,210
You have to go get the Australian keys from over there.

269
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,360
Yeah, it's like a bunch of different currencies.

270
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:39,399
How many barriers to entry of like, I just want to give you money.

271
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:40,759
It's like, oh, cool, blackjack.

272
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,120
Oh, there's five open seats.

273
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,559
This is fucking perfect.

274
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:44,120
Oh, everybody.

275
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

276
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,159
Everybody got your drink.

277
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:45,639
Yeah, sit down.

278
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,200
Let's go.

279
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,159
It's like, I'm sorry, sir.

280
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,980
This is yen.

281
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,019
Oh, this is a yen.

282
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:50,899
This is a yen table.

283
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:55,460
Oh, I see that one requires a different key, even though there's five of them.

284
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:59,750
Not seat is for the summer crates.

285
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,870
You have to be wearing like swim trunks to sit here.

286
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,389
I can open this chat.

287
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:07,590
It's a man co supply crate number 43.

288
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,710
Dude, that's an old one that actually might be worth something.

289
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,590
Some of the old ones.

290
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,710
The reason the burning captains and stuff are worth so much is

291
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,889
because the crates don't drop anymore.

292
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:17,929
I got a rare germ.

293
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:20,649
I got a Berliner's bucket helm.

294
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,809
Oh, what do you got?

295
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:23,769
Oh, you opening crates?

296
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,009
This is the stream now.

297
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:31,960
Hey, it's actually.

298
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:35,750
Look, here's the thing about this, though.

299
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,710
Like technical difficulties.

300
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,870
We can just open crates until we're ready.

301
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,990
This is perfect.

302
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,950
This is actually.

303
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,830
Honestly, I think we should just open crates for four hours.

304
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,830
We just open which is great opening.

305
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:48,870
That's like fun for me, too.

306
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,190
Like that.

307
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,539
I'm fine with that.

308
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:54,460
I had the highest viewership that I've ever had last week when I opened crates,

309
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,419
like by far the least creative and worst stream I've ever done.

310
00:13:58,059 --> 00:14:01,500
It was peak viewership for a non collab stream.

311
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,379
What if I watch you open crates?

312
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:05,500
Oh, that's good.

313
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,500
That will get I think that would do really well.

314
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,669
All right, what about we if we get the five of us to pour all of our audiences

315
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:13,590
into one crate opening stream?

316
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,950
I think that would be a victory.

317
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:20,700
And we all we all just sit around one person opening and we all just we all get a bunch

318
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,539
of crates like 5000 and we all just sit around just screaming every time one opens.

319
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:28,490
I know you're joking, but I would 100% pivot to that right now.

320
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:31,799
Well, I'm opening a 2013 crate right now.

321
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:37,110
This crate was from 2013 and I got the bald eagle.

322
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:42,840
I don't know what that is.

323
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:47,639
Now, chat, I can't right click the crate and get a key because I have the steam overlay

324
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:50,950
off and I have to restart the game again.

325
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,230
But I mean, who are we waiting for?

326
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:55,240
Is everyone still like, what are we doing?

327
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,340
They're doing their stream intro still.

328
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,980
I think Doug had some audio problems.

329
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,259
So we're just waiting for.

330
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:02,139
Oh, OK.

331
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:03,019
Yeah, are you good?

332
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:03,820
But I'm all good now.

333
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,539
Yeah.

334
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:06,299
And then what about Ludd?

335
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:08,419
Is Ludd doing all right?

336
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:11,139
Oh, Ludd was still doing the BuzzFeed quiz.

337
00:15:11,139 --> 00:15:14,549
What do you think he's going to?

338
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:16,570
I think he's going to get spy.

339
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:17,850
Hello, I've gotten my role.

340
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:18,490
Oh, OK.

341
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,379
So is it what is it?

342
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:21,929
I am a sniper.

343
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:23,370
Oh, oh, OK.

344
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,759
What you guys said that like I'm gay and you're conservative.

345
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:28,600
All right.

346
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,320
That's good, man.

347
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,799
I'm proud of you no matter what you play, Ludwig.

348
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:34,759
Thank you, honey.

349
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:37,799
Just going to unlock the jar of piss or mom.

350
00:15:39,289 --> 00:15:42,090
Well, I said, honey, which wouldn't make sense if I was coming out.

351
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,460
What is wrong with sniper?

352
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,179
Be real.

353
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:46,980
No, sniper is great.

354
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,580
Sniper is my favorite class.

355
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:49,779
It's great class.

356
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:55,700
It's tough in man versus machine because we're fighting hordes of robots and it's better at

357
00:15:55,779 --> 00:15:59,940
single target, but it is useful when we're fighting big guys in this mode.

358
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,659
So it's not bad.

359
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:05,299
It's just like more situational, whereas Demoman is just going to rip ass the whole time, you know?

360
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:06,980
Well, what are your classes?

361
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:12,059
Are you I bet you guys got some great classes then.

362
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:18,100
I, uh, I think I have a sniper with piss and a bow and arrow.

363
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,220
Wait, what is that called?

364
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:23,159
It's called Sniper Sniper.

365
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:25,500
Oh, you're you're a sniper, too.

366
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,779
I like to play sniper.

367
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:30,299
Usually I just shoot people with a bow and arrow and I throw piss bottles at them.

368
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:30,940
I'm the scout.

369
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,429
Hey, welcome.

370
00:16:33,429 --> 00:16:33,830
Okay.

371
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,629
Jerma's a scout.

372
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,389
What's your class poke?

373
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,860
I'll do whatever.

374
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,500
Maybe soldier, but like, you know, everyone has a class.

375
00:16:43,059 --> 00:16:46,179
Is this what is your personality or what are you playing?

376
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:48,259
Because I think some people are confused.

377
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:49,139
What's what are you playing?

378
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:50,500
I guess more importantly.

379
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:50,820
Okay.

380
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,399
We're all playing sniper.

381
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:53,720
Wait.

382
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,029
Yeah, I'll play sniper.

383
00:16:57,029 --> 00:16:58,580
I'll play sniper.

384
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,860
I'll play sniper.

385
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:03,620
Is this like the scene in dead poet society?

386
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:05,859
I'm the sniper.

387
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,460
I'll be sniper, too.

388
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,059
I haven't seen that movie in a while.

389
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:11,579
I got a strange equalizer.

390
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:12,460
Is that good or bad?

391
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,799
It's pretty good.

392
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,339
Oh, you can strange a hat.

393
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:16,900
That's weird.

394
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:18,920
All right.

395
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,779
So here's how it's going to work.

396
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:22,140
Thanks for coming, everybody.

397
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:24,700
Thanks for having us.

398
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,900
It's going to be a fun time.

399
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,259
We're going to be playing some man versus machine.

400
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:29,420
If you never played before, it's a PVE mode.

401
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,779
We're not going to be playing as other players.

402
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:33,819
We're going to be working together to fight against robots.

403
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:37,299
So as we're talking about our roles and what we're going to be doing here,

404
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:41,640
I think it's probably good just to kind of get us in.

405
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,240
We don't have to start the round.

406
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,720
We can just kind of get in and you can kind of move around.

407
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,319
You can pick different classes and walk around, shoot the wall for all we need to.

408
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:54,119
I do want to make it very clear that we are going to be playing on...

409
00:17:55,079 --> 00:18:01,500
We had a debate if we were going to do the easy missions or the really hard ones.

410
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,700
And we've decided we are going to be doing the hard ones.

411
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,140
So sorry, those of you that may not have much experience.

412
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,200
It's time to step up.

413
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,200
Yeah, step up, wussies, right?

414
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:14,039
I don't use gendered language.

415
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:16,119
But if I did, ooh, would I rip you a new one?

416
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:20,869
Just give me an unusual right now so I can put it on

417
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:24,390
and just absolutely dunk on these fucking plebs that are in the goddamn call.

418
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,839
Wait, girls don't have buttholes?

419
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:27,480
What? No.

420
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,000
Keyless immediately.

421
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,119
Keyless right now.

422
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:30,680
Wait.

423
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,259
OK, we're ready.

424
00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:33,660
Hold up.

425
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,500
Hold on.

426
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:35,980
Hold on.

427
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,539
I'm doing it.

428
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:36,859
Hold on.

429
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:37,259
I'm getting there.

430
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:42,359
Hold on.

431
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:42,920
Hold on.

432
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,480
Hold on.

433
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,299
We'll do an advanced one.

434
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:49,859
And we'll just mess around and walk around and take a look at stuff.

435
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:51,859
I think I'm going to be the spy.

436
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:52,740
I changed my mind.

437
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,470
I told you.

438
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,140
I told you he was a spy.

439
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,140
I have a really good turtleneck for it.

440
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,210
Yeah, we're going to have a drip contest, too, at the very beginning.

441
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,289
So make sure you put on your best outfit.

442
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:04,599
All right.

443
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:07,299
We're doing advanced.

444
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:08,099
Yes?

445
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:09,579
Yes.

446
00:19:09,579 --> 00:19:12,059
So we're going to be very happy or very sad about this.

447
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:20,200
Chad, I'm going to be Duncan, the big gorilla dude that shoots.

448
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,460
What's his name?

449
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:21,859
Winston?

450
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:24,039
Duncan?

451
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:25,500
What's his name?

452
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:31,529
You mean Winston from Overwatch?

453
00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:33,339
Oh, I thought it was Duncan.

454
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,579
Duncan.

455
00:19:34,579 --> 00:19:35,220
Yeah.

456
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,299
Duncan is actually meeting right now.

457
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:38,740
Like Dunstan checks in.

458
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,859
That's what I was thinking of.

459
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:40,259
Never mind.

460
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:41,299
I'm sorry, German.

461
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:42,740
I ruined your stream.

462
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,299
I'm sorry.

463
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:44,579
You come on.

464
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:51,130
He already gave us performance reviews and told me that jokes were not OK for the stream

465
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:53,130
before we started.

466
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:56,019
Well, man up, man up, man up, man up.

467
00:19:56,019 --> 00:19:56,339
All right.

468
00:19:56,339 --> 00:19:57,859
Everyone pull up your bootstraps.

469
00:19:57,859 --> 00:19:59,380
OK, so here's how it's going to work.

470
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:02,019
What's going to happen is we're going to get into this into this game and we're going to

471
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:02,740
be playing game for you.

472
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:07,220
I find it hilarious that you guys are taking advice on TF2 from Jerma.

473
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,480
So let's take it from you then.

474
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:09,799
Yeah.

475
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:10,119
Yeah.

476
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:10,359
I would.

477
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,220
Lead me then.

478
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:12,859
No.

479
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:13,099
Yeah.

480
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:13,339
Poke.

481
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,140
Poke.

482
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:14,380
Yeah.

483
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,019
Fuck this guy.

484
00:20:15,019 --> 00:20:15,900
You know what I mean?

485
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,019
This game's for children.

486
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:18,059
You'll figure it out.

487
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:18,539
Hey, Vinny.

488
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:19,420
Put your shoes on.

489
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,299
Pull them up.

490
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:21,259
Pull up the shoes.

491
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:23,579
Am I crazy to say it's the opposite of for children?

492
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,019
Oh, my God.

493
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:25,500
Vinny, don't listen.

494
00:20:25,579 --> 00:20:26,700
Watch this movie or no?

495
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,819
I'm not listening to anyone.

496
00:20:27,819 --> 00:20:29,259
I'm listening to my heart.

497
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:30,460
Vinny, don't listen to Sturr.

498
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,259
Fuck this guy.

499
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:32,380
Ludwig, don't listen to him.

500
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,099
He thinks he knows TF2.

501
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,900
I made the TF2 class tutorials back in the day.

502
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,660
Not him.

503
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,329
Yeah, we'll see about that.

504
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:45,289
I mean, I was playing Team Fortress Classic back in the day.

505
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:48,490
So I was I was how I spent most of my high school years.

506
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,750
Just saying a little different.

507
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,789
Spamming grenades.

508
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:54,950
But I was doing it was making it happen.

509
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:57,109
OK, so what do we actually want to play as?

510
00:20:57,109 --> 00:20:59,829
Because we I'll do whatever.

511
00:20:59,829 --> 00:21:00,950
I know we're all playing sniper.

512
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,589
Shit.

513
00:21:01,589 --> 00:21:03,190
All going to do sniper.

514
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,349
We actually do have three snipers, don't we?

515
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:07,589
This is not a random pub.

516
00:21:07,589 --> 00:21:09,509
We're supposed to be strategizing.

517
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:10,470
I'll go heavy.

518
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:14,470
How would you if you wanted to change the class?

519
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,029
Change it.

520
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:19,750
OK, you would press the comma button and that brings a sniper.

521
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,470
No, this is my role.

522
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,380
I'm actually never allied.

523
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,059
Are we all going to be sniper?

524
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:26,779
Can we just do it and just laugh for a minute and then go back?

525
00:21:26,779 --> 00:21:28,700
Look, I did a 30 question quiz.

526
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,190
It'd be crazy to not follow up on it.

527
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,230
Yeah, that's true.

528
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,190
Let me change.

529
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,779
I don't have the piss.

530
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:35,660
Oh, here it is.

531
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:40,250
Oh, if you want to change your loadout, it is M.

532
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:44,630
I should make my sniper look cool.

533
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,650
We have three snipers on the squad.

534
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,150
Oh, yeah, that's what we were doing.

535
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,390
I think we were doing a little a little goofiness.

536
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:53,400
We're getting goofy.

537
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:53,640
All right.

538
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,000
So members, let's I know I'm explaining Andy.

539
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,339
But listen, there is a counter over here.

540
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:01,140
You have money.

541
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,220
We collect money each wave.

542
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,579
We get a certain amount of money.

543
00:22:04,579 --> 00:22:06,660
You use that money to upgrade your character.

544
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,619
Be careful because everything you do is permanent.

545
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:10,180
It is not.

546
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,299
Actually, that was a lie.

547
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:13,380
You can refund all your upgrades in the bottom left.

548
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,180
I just I forgot.

549
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,660
OK, so you can refund your upgrades.

550
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,039
But these are important.

551
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:23,240
And everything in your inventory can be upgraded.

552
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,680
Including your heads only.

553
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,599
I'm not worried about all this explanation.

554
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:27,880
It's just lights out for me.

555
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:33,529
Honestly, I like that straight line and you're going to shoot them.

556
00:22:33,529 --> 00:22:35,059
We're playing machine.

557
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:36,660
This is 20 year old AI.

558
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,940
They can't be that good.

559
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,619
You know, I like that.

560
00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:42,180
I like that.

561
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:47,670
I actually like that confidence.

562
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:48,230
So we do.

563
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,990
We're doing five snipers, huh?

564
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:51,190
I guess that's what we're doing.

565
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,509
Can someone build a dispenser?

566
00:22:53,509 --> 00:22:54,069
We can't.

567
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:56,150
No, no, no, no.

568
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,750
On sniper, build a dispenser.

569
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,750
Someone in my chat said kick the heavy.

570
00:23:00,869 --> 00:23:03,910
Well, actually, no poke you.

571
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,539
We could have one heavy that would that would be actually perfect.

572
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:10,250
We can do five medics and one heavy and just see what does.

573
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:13,619
You want to just all just just heal poke.

574
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:16,180
That's kind of fun.

575
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,059
I'll do it.

576
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:19,460
We have no scout either.

577
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,339
All right, let's look.

578
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:21,460
OK, let's get out there.

579
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,539
Do your upgrades.

580
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:25,319
Put me in, coach.

581
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:26,119
Put me in.

582
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:27,640
And look at the top.

583
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,319
That is the classes that are coming out there.

584
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:29,799
Scout.

585
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:30,839
It's a fast class.

586
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:32,039
The first class in the slot.

587
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,799
Number one can move pretty quickly.

588
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:35,160
Has bonk atomic punch.

589
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,680
I find it strange that people standing in spawn have toggled ready.

590
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,369
Start my countdown timer.

591
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:43,029
Wait, so should I be sniper?

592
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:44,309
What's wrong with spawn?

593
00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:45,190
I'm a sniper.

594
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,470
We have to be out there.

595
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,589
There's a wave of it.

596
00:23:47,589 --> 00:23:49,029
I'm the only person out here.

597
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:50,069
I'm the only person here.

598
00:23:50,869 --> 00:23:52,309
I'll be out here in the front there.

599
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:53,990
All the bots are coming from one place.

600
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,029
They come from one direction.

601
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:55,990
They see the track.

602
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:59,210
See these little these little dollops on the ground.

603
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:01,289
This is the path that they take.

604
00:24:01,289 --> 00:24:02,579
How do you use the canteen?

605
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:03,059
The second class.

606
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:04,900
Didn't you guys study for this?

607
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:08,579
He has four rockets, but that's not always the case because he might have a couple of

608
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:11,700
rocket launchers that have different amounts of ammunition, different amounts of rockets

609
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:12,740
quantities.

610
00:24:15,849 --> 00:24:16,490
Chat, I give it.

611
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:22,250
I give it like 10 seconds before we lose the round and have to reset.

612
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,289
No, no, no, no, no.

613
00:24:23,289 --> 00:24:24,890
I got a bow and arrow.

614
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,490
We're already got an amazing shot.

615
00:24:27,369 --> 00:24:28,009
We're fine.

616
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:30,970
Taking all the money, man.

617
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:31,930
You're not sharing at all.

618
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,210
Wait, does it split?

619
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:36,170
Does it split it?

620
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,930
Oh, sorry.

621
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:38,490
We'll talk later.

622
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:39,210
My chest hurts.

623
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:43,140
You take it all the fucking money.

624
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:43,859
I can't see.

625
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:46,180
I can't see through us because we're all snipers.

626
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:46,900
They've been pissed.

627
00:24:47,859 --> 00:24:49,750
Why did I pick the classic?

628
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,829
This is like the worst item for man versus machine.

629
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:56,180
Not having a teleporter is awful, by the way.

630
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:59,160
Yeah, well, maybe you should have played engineer.

631
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:08,309
Oh, I definitely would not recommend bow and arrow for this mode.

632
00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:08,869
Game mode.

633
00:25:08,869 --> 00:25:09,349
Hell no.

634
00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:13,539
Hey, they shoot back.

635
00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:13,779
Yep.

636
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,700
They do shoot back.

637
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,339
Certainly can.

638
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:18,099
They do exist.

639
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:19,960
Somebody build.

640
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:23,960
Guys, they're getting real close to our base and whatnot.

641
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,630
It's okay.

642
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:30,710
I got arrows, a barrage of arrows and back in here.

643
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:31,670
Oh, they're behind us.

644
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:39,319
Oh, you ammo.

645
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:39,720
Ammo?

646
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:40,759
Yeah, we don't have any ammo.

647
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:41,559
Where's our engineer?

648
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:44,359
I think we're going to be all right.

649
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:45,799
I am shocked we've lived this long.

650
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:46,440
I'm going to be honest.

651
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,220
Oh, poke doing work.

652
00:25:49,859 --> 00:25:50,420
I saw that.

653
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:55,210
By the way, if they get the bomb in, we lose.

654
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,170
What happens if you die?

655
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:57,049
Oh, that's what happens.

656
00:25:57,049 --> 00:25:58,890
You come back, but yeah, it's a cool down.

657
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,490
Yeah, he's getting the bomb.

658
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,480
Oh, Lord.

659
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:10,619
Did we survive?

660
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:10,859
Yeah.

661
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,339
All right, let's let's wait with this.

662
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:14,460
$14 we're missing.

663
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,319
If we don't get all the money, we don't get a bonus.

664
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:17,559
All right.

665
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:19,480
Are we playing on like baby easy mode?

666
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:19,960
There's more.

667
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,759
There's more.

668
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:21,960
There's there's soldiers.

669
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:24,200
It's wave one out of seven.

670
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:28,039
Oh, boogers just flew out of that's going to be somebody's going to get a clip of that.

671
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:29,319
Boogers just flew out of my nose.

672
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:29,960
They're at the bomb.

673
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,680
They went down the left.

674
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,480
They went down the left.

675
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,119
They're at that thing.

676
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:32,839
We're losing wave.

677
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:33,240
I'm coming.

678
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:33,640
I'm coming.

679
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,039
I'm coming.

680
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:34,440
I'm coming.

681
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:34,839
I'm coming.

682
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:40,900
We're going to lose.

683
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,299
We lost.

684
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:41,539
We lost.

685
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:41,859
We lost.

686
00:26:41,859 --> 00:26:42,019
Sorry.

687
00:26:42,579 --> 00:26:42,980
No, we didn't.

688
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,220
We're good.

689
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:43,539
We're good.

690
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:44,740
No, we didn't.

691
00:26:45,619 --> 00:26:46,579
Not yet, germ.

692
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:47,299
Not yet, buddy.

693
00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:48,900
I'm shooting as many as I can.

694
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,240
Get the scout.

695
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:51,559
Get scout.

696
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:52,359
Get scout.

697
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:52,680
Okay.

698
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,680
Not yet, buddy.

699
00:26:55,779 --> 00:26:59,460
We lost $14 and I am fucking mad about it.

700
00:27:00,099 --> 00:27:01,059
Clutch or kick.

701
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:02,980
We're not going to get the achievement.

702
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:03,700
I know.

703
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,900
Oh, we need an explosive headshot.

704
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,460
That sounds good.

705
00:27:06,329 --> 00:27:08,170
Yeah, 100% get that.

706
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:10,890
I need to be able to hit a headshot because I don't think it's happened once.

707
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:12,970
It is one.

708
00:27:13,529 --> 00:27:15,799
How is that not a headshot?

709
00:27:17,049 --> 00:27:17,690
Oh, I died.

710
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:19,049
Oh, no.

711
00:27:19,769 --> 00:27:23,990
Bunch of heavies incoming.

712
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:25,369
Shoot them.

713
00:27:25,369 --> 00:27:25,930
What the heck?

714
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:26,569
I'm shooting them.

715
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,619
I don't shoot fast enough is the problem.

716
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:31,380
That's right.

717
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,420
It has to be fully charged.

718
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,460
This is the worst weapon in the game.

719
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,980
How the hell did we survive?

720
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,700
Good job, everybody.

721
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,660
We did it.

722
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,220
You got an A on your first test.

723
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,740
Rage against the machine.

724
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,299
That's a good one.

725
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:41,859
Not bad.

726
00:27:41,859 --> 00:27:43,240
I get it.

727
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:43,480
Now's the fun part.

728
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,319
Can you change classes midway through or no?

729
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,440
Yes, you can.

730
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,440
We want to like take this seriously now or are we good to just

731
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,500
snipe?

732
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,500
Um, I'm taking it pretty serious.

733
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,339
Are we taking it serious now?

734
00:27:56,339 --> 00:27:59,430
Oh, I don't tell y'all I've been sweating.

735
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,769
Yeah, let's take it seriously.

736
00:28:01,769 --> 00:28:04,970
If we're going to take it seriously, then we need somebody needs to be engineer.

737
00:28:06,089 --> 00:28:07,130
I could be medic.

738
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:07,930
Medic works for me.

739
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:17,210
I really I'm not sure I'm good with a lot of classes anymore.

740
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:18,089
Make sure you refund.

741
00:28:18,089 --> 00:28:19,609
Are we actually swapping now?

742
00:28:19,609 --> 00:28:21,289
Yeah, refund before you swap, though.

743
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:23,460
Refund before you swap.

744
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,099
You get the money.

745
00:28:24,099 --> 00:28:25,220
Vinny, stay sniper.

746
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,180
You're a good sniper.

747
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,609
If there's double sniper, I won't be a sniper.

748
00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:32,490
Someone said someone said there you can charge a sniper.

749
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:32,970
What does that mean?

750
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:35,930
OK, so the more damage it does.

751
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:37,369
Really?

752
00:28:37,369 --> 00:28:37,849
Yeah.

753
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:39,750
Like Widowmaker.

754
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,029
Just like Widowmaker.

755
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:41,529
Oh, OK.

756
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:42,869
Yeah.

757
00:28:42,869 --> 00:28:45,589
I mean, I was a Widowmaker main, so it should be not.

758
00:28:45,589 --> 00:28:46,630
Yeah, you played Overwatch.

759
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:49,990
Then, you know, every single thing that's in this game, you know, everything about this

760
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:50,549
game.

761
00:28:50,549 --> 00:28:51,509
Oh, great.

762
00:28:51,509 --> 00:28:54,099
All right, Chris Krieg.

763
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,460
I think Chris Krieg is probably the one.

764
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,700
Um, what do you prefer?

765
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,579
Sniper if you want.

766
00:29:04,579 --> 00:29:05,779
I could swap off.

767
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:08,740
You know, I can do spy if you prefer some.

768
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,859
I'm good with Demoman.

769
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,460
OK, you guys, I mean, all jokes aside, just play whatever you want.

770
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:13,960
Yeah.

771
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,900
Rotate out as well.

772
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,779
The hell is going on?

773
00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:18,819
Wait, what is that?

774
00:29:18,819 --> 00:29:19,380
Who did that?

775
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:21,940
Is it weird?

776
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,500
OK, come on.

777
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,140
Was that was that real?

778
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,609
He switched off sniper.

779
00:29:25,609 --> 00:29:26,490
Oh, yeah, elbow kick.

780
00:29:27,589 --> 00:29:28,150
No, no, no.

781
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,430
I actually will get booted from the game.

782
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:29,910
Don't do that.

783
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:33,819
This will like ruin everything.

784
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,430
Well, then you should have done it.

785
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,190
Don't do that.

786
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:40,759
All right.

787
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:42,359
Who who wants the crits?

788
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:45,180
And if you want to know what the crits are, the me.

789
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,380
Go stock sniper with explosive headshots.

790
00:29:49,019 --> 00:29:50,779
The seventh class in the game is the medic.

791
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,700
That's what I am doing.

792
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,660
Is that dumb?

793
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,220
No, that's good.

794
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:54,539
That's good.

795
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:55,420
That's what my chat saying.

796
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:55,980
That's a good thing.

797
00:29:59,509 --> 00:29:59,750
All right.

798
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,470
I'm not doing it to you.

799
00:30:01,109 --> 00:30:01,910
Oh, all right.

800
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:02,230
Vinny.

801
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:04,819
All right.

802
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:06,660
We're all on the roof on the roof.

803
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,700
I'm up here.

804
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,299
Yeah, look at Jerma stream.

805
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:10,579
He got the slick back here.

806
00:30:10,579 --> 00:30:11,220
Looking like he's trying to.

807
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,220
I mean, are we a drip contest or no?

808
00:30:14,019 --> 00:30:14,900
Oh, that's right.

809
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,180
Yeah, we'll do drip contest after this.

810
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:16,420
All right.

811
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,059
Tank is in this very where we're doing it right now.

812
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,220
Stock grenade launcher is better.

813
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:24,059
Use Scottish resistance.

814
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:25,819
Oh, man, I'm getting so many suggestions.

815
00:30:25,819 --> 00:30:26,619
All right.

816
00:30:26,619 --> 00:30:28,460
When you're ready, just unload on that thing.

817
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,259
I'm going to give you crits.

818
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,200
Now I missed all.

819
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,920
I forgot this even existed.

820
00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:42,069
Guys, my gun is really loud.

821
00:30:42,069 --> 00:30:42,549
I forgot.

822
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,680
Turn it down.

823
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:46,519
Ding.

824
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,859
I'm getting it.

825
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,349
Watch out.

826
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,630
By the way, there are spies now.

827
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:55,829
So if you see somebody that looks like you, it's not you.

828
00:30:55,829 --> 00:30:57,589
If you see something, say something.

829
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:58,869
Is that not me?

830
00:30:58,869 --> 00:30:59,349
That's not you.

831
00:30:59,349 --> 00:31:00,390
I thought that was me.

832
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:01,910
Okay, I'm going to shoot the bomb.

833
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,509
You guys keep shooting the car.

834
00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:04,230
Yeah, we're not.

835
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:07,109
It's priority is the car to be shot.

836
00:31:07,109 --> 00:31:08,230
Drop this right here.

837
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:09,589
Not me.

838
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:13,589
Oh, by the way, if you need health, press E so I can see.

839
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:15,910
Oh, that is a lot of soldiers.

840
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:17,690
I got you.

841
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:19,589
They can't be headshot.

842
00:31:19,589 --> 00:31:20,150
I'm in trouble.

843
00:31:21,349 --> 00:31:22,470
I'll stay on the tank.

844
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:25,910
Me and poke should be able to get a tank if I do it.

845
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,710
All right, I'll try to take the soldiers with the century.

846
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:30,390
Where's the ammo?

847
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,769
Oh, it's down here.

848
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:33,529
There's a spice.

849
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:37,380
Yes, it's over.

850
00:31:38,339 --> 00:31:40,680
It's to the right, basically the right pathway.

851
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:43,859
I'm not liking where this tank is at fellas.

852
00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:44,839
Tank is almost there.

853
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:47,240
I will move my century towards it.

854
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,039
It's going to run me over.

855
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,960
Oh, yeah, it can run you over.

856
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,160
It actually can kill you instantly.

857
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,839
Guys, it's getting close.

858
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:53,319
It's mine.

859
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:53,799
It's mine.

860
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:57,049
It's the tank, guys, it's the tank, it's the tank.

861
00:31:57,049 --> 00:31:57,609
It's in my century.

862
00:31:58,730 --> 00:31:59,289
The tank.

863
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:00,730
It's got to get in.

864
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:01,369
It's got to get in.

865
00:32:01,369 --> 00:32:07,559
All eyes on tank, all DPS, all DPS on tank, all DPS.

866
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:08,200
I'm trying.

867
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:08,759
I'm trying.

868
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:10,440
I can't do it fast enough, buddy.

869
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,400
I can't do it fast enough.

870
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,359
We actually might be able to do it.

871
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:12,839
We can do it.

872
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:13,400
We can do it.

873
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:13,960
We can do it.

874
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,599
We actually might be able to do it.

875
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:17,240
Go, go, go, go, go.

876
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,279
Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.

877
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:18,759
Oh, we're dead.

878
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:19,160
It's over.

879
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,240
No, no, we can do this.

880
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,880
Gang, we thought we saved it for a minute.

881
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,079
Okay, we're good.

882
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:26,519
All right, I gotta stop saying it's over.

883
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:29,430
I'm died.

884
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:31,269
I'm coming to come, we're good.

885
00:32:31,269 --> 00:32:33,430
You can press H to respawn instantly.

886
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:36,140
It costs money, but I can revive you.

887
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,500
I can revive you if I get you.

888
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,859
No, I missed the shot.

889
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:40,700
Oh, sorry, it's okay.

890
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,779
All right, we needed more snipers.

891
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:43,579
I don't know.

892
00:32:43,579 --> 00:32:45,099
Yeah, we needed more snipers.

893
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:47,099
It was way easier when we were all sniper

894
00:32:47,579 --> 00:32:50,390
Who's restarting what's going on?

895
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:54,549
Wait, are we not returning? We are right? No, no, no, we know we're good

896
00:32:54,549 --> 00:32:58,710
We just get essentially we just go back to where we were at the beginning of that round

897
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:03,390
It's not like oh we lost we got a rekey. Yeah, you get your money back and you get to try again

898
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,650
Just pick pyro

899
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:23,670
Special key I'm switching I'm not sniper dude. I'm a spy

900
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:27,170
I might go pyro should I just go flog pyro? Just say who cares?

901
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:32,410
I mean, I mean what pyro would wreck the tank Vinny. Do you have the log?

902
00:33:33,589 --> 00:33:37,029
Let me check because I can always switch out of pyro. I don't have the flog

903
00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:43,549
You want why don't you do pyro and I'll I'll do I'll continue with demo but with better weapon, okay

904
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:49,890
Yeah, I'll let me let me refund and I'll go what should I use for my upgrades as a spy?

905
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:59,569
Mm-hmm. So you're a Scottish resistance and pin the sapper is incredible in man vs machine because the sapper

906
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:03,509
Disables the robots when you have enough upgrades in it

907
00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:07,150
You can do a huge AOE and turn they go

908
00:34:07,349 --> 00:34:11,789
And they power down for like five to ten straight seconds a huge group of them. So it's really really good

909
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:15,070
Why'd you want me to put the pan on chat? It's just a power copy

910
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:20,710
Blood blood, you know, I'll backstab work in the game you stab in the back and they die instantly

911
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:24,349
Yeah, yeah, so if you can get behind him, then that will do a lot

912
00:34:24,349 --> 00:34:29,369
I'll just increase my jump height and then I'll be able to jump over them. This is really fun

913
00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:31,250
I actually like this a lot. I do have a big problem though

914
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:34,489
Unfortunately, I might not be able to play flog because I'm not high

915
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:41,929
I'll have to take a five-minute break

916
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:43,929
All damage

917
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:52,909
We lose this I'm out. Oh, we don't wait. How do I use sappers and cloaks?

918
00:34:53,269 --> 00:34:58,630
Okay, so right click to cloak sapper. You have to pull it out and then you just left click to put it on a thing

919
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,710
Like any trick your sniper still has four to pull out the sapper or two

920
00:35:05,789 --> 00:35:08,869
Yeah, this is I spy. I'm Pat. This is fun. I like this a lot

921
00:35:09,389 --> 00:35:16,070
Did this require a coupon I'm a spy right now it requires it requires one $1 coupon there

922
00:35:16,429 --> 00:35:21,789
Also, I was reminded queuing for us. There's a squad surplus where you'd like one ticket pays for everybody. Oh shit

923
00:35:21,789 --> 00:35:26,710
We probably should have done wait. No squad surplus. All that does it just makes us we get more items in the end

924
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:34,329
Oh, nevermind. Yeah, everybody has to still buy it. I mean everyone ready at four. Oh, yeah. Sorry, but this time

925
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:37,190
I'm ready to rock and roll flog pyro. Oh

926
00:35:40,469 --> 00:35:43,550
Passer this thing is amazing in members machine, by the way

927
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:50,400
This guy's been looking up the strats. No, I I've we've been talking about playing this like two months

928
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:54,119
Wait, really?

929
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:57,639
Prepared a little bit better. The knife does not work on the tank heads up

930
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,860
So you can shoot with your gun because there's no guys coming yet

931
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,699
Where's the I get a better headshot sound cuz my

932
00:36:06,219 --> 00:36:08,719
I

933
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:16,179
Got one of me going spin. Oh, that's the one most. No, I'll get that to you. I'll send you that wave. Don't worry

934
00:36:16,179 --> 00:36:17,380
I need a minute

935
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:20,519
I'm gonna get face down

936
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:25,449
Did you get spied by a spy as a spy? Yes, I did. I

937
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:34,159
Didn't know that was a thing. Oh, we're doing way better now with this composition. This is really way

938
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:36,199
You do

939
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,400
Yes proximity does matter

940
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:47,840
right

941
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:51,260
Going in for the kill the bombs going, right?

942
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,880
All right. I need help with the tank

943
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:56,460
Yeah, I bet you do

944
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,059
Yeah, I do. That's why I said it my century. I'll get it. You guys can go back to the robots

945
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:03,280
Oh, nice. Nice. Nice. That's right. Trying to I'm gonna get the

946
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,860
bomb carriers I

947
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,280
Died Oh

948
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:14,070
Alright bombs over here. Oh, there's a lot of money on the ground. We got to get this. Oh

949
00:37:16,789 --> 00:37:18,789
They got me

950
00:37:18,789 --> 00:37:21,989
I'm collecting money. I'm like money's I'm trying to I'm trying oh

951
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:31,789
We got lots of snipers and spies by spawn shit, I try to jump over it. Oh, never mind. They're dead

952
00:37:31,789 --> 00:37:36,289
I think we're watch out for spies spies me spies me poke. Watch out turn on

953
00:37:36,889 --> 00:37:38,539
That's a spy

954
00:37:38,539 --> 00:37:48,590
Save the century how about it? We're gonna we're okay. We're doing fine. We're doing good. Not bad and chat

955
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:55,349
I have not played much man versus man. This is like man versus machine. What are we doing Ludwig? Do you know you can disguise?

956
00:37:56,349 --> 00:38:06,489
You can so they don't shoot you when you're disguised. You don't have to be invisible. I love

957
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:10,289
They don't I don't I can't hit them when I'm disguised

958
00:38:11,449 --> 00:38:15,980
Yeah, but they won't shoot you and you could just walk up to him and sap him. Hey, we're good

959
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:22,179
Oh, you sap you can sap on visible. Yeah. No, I'll disguise. That's what I meant. Wait. Yes

960
00:38:22,179 --> 00:38:24,179
What's the difference between disguise and invisible?

961
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:29,619
Invisible is they can't no one can see but it's basically in man versus machine disguise is better than being invisible

962
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:43,039
You want some here you want coffee you want a sip which would be pressing for I think yeah, I think I'll

963
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,480
Get more penetration

964
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:54,590
It's what we're all trying to do in life, isn't it? That's right. All right. Now this thing is powered up gonna be awesome

965
00:38:55,030 --> 00:39:05,570
All right. So we have if it's you see the red background that means that it is guaranteed crits every single shot

966
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:13,739
And it's the infinite symbol means that they have infinite ammo and they just BAM and there's a hundred and twenty-eight scouts

967
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:24,679
We're fucked just shoot them. Wait chat. Should I do all sticky upgrades? What do you guys think in here?

968
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:30,039
Sticky bomb is good for a demo for this mode sticky

969
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:36,969
It's been a long time, but you can have a ton of stickies out right if you are good for slow targets

970
00:39:36,969 --> 00:39:40,699
Yeah, it just does so much damage versus tanks

971
00:39:40,699 --> 00:39:46,079
If you have a tank is coming out and you get crits you get a crits canteen and you just put out an entire

972
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,929
Just magazine of learning know what it's called. Whatever people gonna make fun of me

973
00:39:51,969 --> 00:39:54,650
You put you just do the whole clip out and you'll do

974
00:39:55,210 --> 00:40:01,510
Thousands of damage to the tank. Okay. Yeah, I'm gonna try that. I see what that's like find a button for a canteen

975
00:40:01,869 --> 00:40:03,469
What is what does the canteen do?

976
00:40:03,469 --> 00:40:10,710
So the canteen at the last tab in the shop allows you to buy personal little power-ups for yourself

977
00:40:10,789 --> 00:40:15,190
One of them is invincibility, which is uber charge. So you become invincible for five seconds

978
00:40:15,389 --> 00:40:20,789
The other one is crits, which is obviously you get it times three damage. Where is that? How much it is?

979
00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:23,099
I don't know

980
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,980
Really doesn't care

981
00:40:28,219 --> 00:40:33,260
Technical with it. I don't give a shit about it. Crikey fucking losers in my chat correcting me

982
00:40:33,659 --> 00:40:48,000
You guys are doing a really good job here. I'm just waiting to come in

983
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,780
Get closer and then I'll detonate. Oh

984
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:57,659
What it's a germa ADHD special interest stream

985
00:41:00,179 --> 00:41:02,179
Wasn't visible I thought I'd play that well

986
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:06,619
Like a hitbox like a lobbyist big paying me to do this. What does that even mean?

987
00:41:07,139 --> 00:41:10,809
All right, we have a lot of money we need to get big TF2

988
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:20,079
They're they're moving on the left the bomb. I got it

989
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:26,519
No, not your my left. I got him. I got my left your left. I just took care. Are they dead?

990
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:29,400
Yeah, I took care of it. He's making a bomb down over here

991
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:33,139
Freaking out with my sentry here. I big soldier big soldier

992
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:44,659
Nice, I'm trying not to whip the stickies chat

993
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:48,260
which is a really specific and weird sentence, but

994
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:50,739
You get it

995
00:41:54,139 --> 00:41:56,309
I just taunted

996
00:41:58,929 --> 00:42:03,860
Whoa, oh centers down

997
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:10,300
What is

998
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:18,739
It was a very my thing is so loud my head shots elected. Oh, yeah

999
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:24,380
You're uh, guys you can change the hit songs the bomb is at the thing lower the bomb is that thing I'm whiffing chat

1000
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,739
I'm whiffing

1001
00:42:25,739 --> 00:42:28,239
Okay, it's good. Oh shit bomb. Is that the thing?

1002
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:31,159
I'll drop the center over there

1003
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:44,400
Sorry, we're good. We're okay. We got we got further that time. I don't even want to see that from your point of view

1004
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,400
I let him go by me. I

1005
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:52,639
Gross I'm so sorry. I don't want to be around anymore. No, it's all right. We're doing fine. This is advanced

1006
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:55,820
This is not this is hard. You guys are doing great

1007
00:42:56,579 --> 00:43:01,619
Yes, I'm switching. I'm not the spy anymore. Make sure you refund if you refund you get all the money back

1008
00:43:01,699 --> 00:43:04,139
Yeah, but make you have to do it before you switch classes

1009
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,420
Then he did it before right? You did it after you'd be screwed her

1010
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:12,360
I you might have to just go back and yeah, you just swap back and then you go to the thing and refund

1011
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:15,199
I will be

1012
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:20,889
Who's this dude, honestly soldier gun soldier heavy

1013
00:43:21,409 --> 00:43:27,519
I'm what I'm older. I mean, they just they just do so much pot. They have so much power. This guy seems cool

1014
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:31,139
Demo, man. Oh, it's someone already demo man. Yeah, we have one

1015
00:43:31,139 --> 00:43:39,059
I'm gonna try the more than one demo. I can be we have that poke is that hey engineer soldier

1016
00:43:39,579 --> 00:43:41,380
You go you go heavy

1017
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:47,150
Load, you might like it. You want less reload speed? Hey engineer. Come over here. I really should stay on medic

1018
00:43:47,309 --> 00:43:56,530
Where or a scout? No, this is where I should set up over here entry goes here. Okay, I'll do it

1019
00:43:56,530 --> 00:44:06,699
I learned my lesson a long time ago. Never believe ha ha ha ha. Oh, they're talking about channel points

1020
00:44:06,699 --> 00:44:13,349
I get it gotta move that gear up

1021
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:25,940
Ideally at the corner wait like here. Yeah, so that you can hide behind the wall and still repair it

1022
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:27,699
Oh, I thought I would get hit from here

1023
00:44:27,699 --> 00:44:29,539
But yeah, I guess you're right or at this corner

1024
00:44:29,539 --> 00:44:36,739
So you have to still have the dispenser in the ammo we could always just do six engineers and say who cares and just go

1025
00:44:37,059 --> 00:44:52,360
That'd be kind of fun. Do you know what I care ready up? Are we good to go? Yeah. Oh

1026
00:44:53,940 --> 00:45:03,519
Yeah, almost I'm putting on these things Chad. Do not question my sticky placement. It's great

1027
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:09,210
So the question minigun, oh cool. I couldn't overwatch just do this

1028
00:45:09,809 --> 00:45:16,599
Well, they don't get an overwatch. Yeah, why couldn't they have Duncan do this in overwatch?

1029
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:29,849
Duncan Idaho, I don't feel like I'm hitting them. Oh right when they land they're invincible for like a half a second

1030
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:37,179
Damn, this pyro fronts doing really well

1031
00:45:37,739 --> 00:45:43,079
Yep, pick up that money. I'm trying to drop left

1032
00:45:44,019 --> 00:45:47,920
Big soldier got me

1033
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:51,960
There you go big soldiers getting destroyed nice

1034
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:54,599
Nice, that was way cleaner than last time

1035
00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:59,429
There's a lot of my century in an actual good spot is probably helping him

1036
00:45:59,429 --> 00:46:02,269
What do you while I'm not down there? Can one of you go grab that money work goes away?

1037
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:08,800
Yeah, you don't get the money if you don't pick it up and it go it disappears the money for upgrading. I got it

1038
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:21,920
Century buster, where's it at Jesus? Yeah, so a scout actually is the money collector

1039
00:46:36,429 --> 00:46:40,789
Gaming a bomb approaching on a scout hook. I got a great view of that, by the way

1040
00:46:41,389 --> 00:46:43,389
You saw that? Yeah

1041
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:50,389
Yeah, I'm not gonna know the meta like I'm doing my best but like it's gonna take a while to learn meta

1042
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:52,590
I'm just gonna listen to Jerma

1043
00:46:55,550 --> 00:47:01,869
Well, listen to me for don't I just got killed from behind by a sniper bitch killed me

1044
00:47:03,909 --> 00:47:07,489
All right

1045
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:10,050
Where are you at big rounds?

1046
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:16,829
It was a 30 kill round for me. Is that like not bad? That's pretty desperate damn good

1047
00:47:17,309 --> 00:47:22,750
I'm still going. Yeah, we go bomb is here. Guess. Don't get too cocky. Yeah, I

1048
00:47:23,309 --> 00:47:25,630
See how it works. No, if you see money grab it

1049
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:30,630
Shit. Hey, why didn't overwatch do this? This is crazy. Listen

1050
00:47:31,389 --> 00:47:35,309
Isn't this like the most fun you've ever had in a video game? Like how come why didn't they just do this?

1051
00:47:35,309 --> 00:47:37,869
Oh, I have never been happier

1052
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:41,510
Okay, I got some stickies by the bomb here snipers

1053
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:45,949
Take on the tower defense games

1054
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:54,449
Not one of you okay, I was gonna say overwatch has the

1055
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:59,650
The workshop which allows you to adjust all the attack speed and everything like they could

1056
00:48:00,289 --> 00:48:02,650
Up in MBO. I hear where

1057
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:10,409
Now they're gone, but yeah, we need to keep an eye on I'll be back here to keep an eye on the bomb

1058
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:23,550
We're good. We're good. We're good one scout going right one scout. There's literally one scout

1059
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:26,510
I'm not fast enough to get him. He's at the bottom right now. Nice and

1060
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:40,000
That is a successful wave completed. Yeah

1061
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,840
Our scout should be picking that up

1062
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,780
Hey, it's a bit of a scout. Oh

1063
00:48:49,739 --> 00:48:56,539
All right chat. Let's see. What am I upgrading here now that I have all my damage up?

1064
00:48:56,539 --> 00:49:03,150
This is where I really shine as a vlog pyro find canteens. Okay, I will but

1065
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:21,909
Wait, I lost upgrades of you switch guns. Oh

1066
00:49:22,929 --> 00:49:29,050
Yes, you because you all the upgrade is there's so many different weapons in the game it's individual to each item Oh

1067
00:49:30,369 --> 00:49:37,039
Burn damage sucks, dude. What really? What do you mean burn damage is useless here? Why I understand

1068
00:49:39,269 --> 00:49:48,389
Wait had the wrong one to mine. It's it's already H. Okay, like H Judd Benjamin. It's only after burn. Oh

1069
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:52,269
Okay, I thought it was all right. That makes sense. Yep. Yep. That's true

1070
00:49:55,480 --> 00:50:05,480
Resistances in the character menu Oh fire and create and all that stuff. Okay, dude, this germans. This is your fourth tour. Is it nice?

1071
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:18,070
Yeah, apparently you're a little bit of a pro health on kill is important. Yeah, so I need crit resistance for this wave

1072
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,650
It's good to have anyways

1073
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:30,289
For this wave no, but not for this particular wave eyes this wave don't get backstabbed. Yes. All right

1074
00:50:30,289 --> 00:50:36,730
I'm good. Put it into jump height. Why would you ever put it into jump height? What is that? What would that do?

1075
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:41,539
Someone said Vinnie. I thought you were a pan lover zero upgrades sad face

1076
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:46,900
People do some goofy shit in members machine. It's like oh, yeah

1077
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:53,000
I'm gonna put on a like the fish and fully upgraded and then do jump height and movement speed

1078
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,119
It's like okay. Well, we're gonna lose but you're gonna have a good time. Yeah, pretty much

1079
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:01,670
Alright, where should I post up as a machine gun enthusiast?

1080
00:51:01,989 --> 00:51:07,469
So it's distance matter with me is good because then you're near the dispenser. Yeah, so you see

00:51:18,989 --> 00:51:31,320

1084
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,320
Mark, Jeremy, I'm really happy with your performance

1085
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:45,360
Whoa, I see I should have stood closer to the refrigerator. We're good

1086
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:52,199
Spies are here. If you think I can somebody it might be somebody else. Yeah, we need that money

00:52:01,239 --> 00:52:04,320

00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:39,789
Okay, that's fine. I gotta get this fucking money

1095
00:52:40,469 --> 00:52:42,480
They got snipers

1096
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:51,639
To the streets. Let's go. Oh my god. He's going to get weak. He's going the bomb real fast. No

1097
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,320
We got a problem on the left side

1098
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,320
Oh

1099
00:52:57,670 --> 00:53:03,110
All right, we need that money we got oh we got the money we're good. Oh, we're good. All those were spies. Okay

1100
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:06,070
I'm I took buster took out the spies. I'm not moving

1101
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:13,860
What bunch people ran by me? You gotta move. I'm holding up the front you guys can keep the back alive

1102
00:53:14,539 --> 00:53:20,889
That's a lot of money sentry buster coming in. I don't know from where oh shit scouts a scout

1103
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:26,809
You don't know where from where Jerma I don't I got distracted a scout was right here

1104
00:53:26,809 --> 00:53:29,050
I'm real. I'm real. I'm real same place. Oh god

1105
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:31,690
If I wasn't looking

1106
00:53:31,849 --> 00:53:34,210
And they always go to the century

1107
00:53:34,809 --> 00:53:36,610
Just stop

1108
00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:39,130
Shining a microscope onto how stupid I am

1109
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:44,670
Free to be honest that way

1110
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:48,510
Alright

1111
00:53:50,349 --> 00:53:55,730
Where's our scout at I want to yell at them it could be me. I'm supposed to be getting the money

1112
00:53:56,329 --> 00:54:02,530
I got it. Yeah soldiers Opie. So do you guys think that owning a microscope is a really terrible idea?

1113
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:03,969
I want to get in real life

1114
00:54:03,969 --> 00:54:09,449
Yeah in real life like buying a microscope and again, and I'll give you the thesis here. How much is the microscope?

1115
00:54:09,449 --> 00:54:16,769
I got a hundred bucks like guys. No idea. That's great. Yeah, like ten bucks. What doesn't matter like it's not about how much it costs

1116
00:54:16,769 --> 00:54:23,570
It's about what you would do when you had it and what I'm talking about here is I'm talking about I would get I would

1117
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:28,690
Put a drop of water on that look at it from my sink or something and be like I'm never drinking water from here ever

1118
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:32,900
Again, oh, yeah. Well, I just realize a microscope is different than a telescope

1119
00:54:34,099 --> 00:54:36,159
It's the opposite. Yeah

1120
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:40,159
There's actually this thing that went around recently like an article about how New York City

1121
00:54:40,599 --> 00:54:45,329
Water fountains have like little shrimps in them. So like when you're drinking out of a water fountain

1122
00:54:45,329 --> 00:54:53,219
There's like microscopic shrimps in water and I live in New York City. I will never touch that again unless I need protein

1123
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:58,590
I'm it's flavor right? You don't like free flavoring. It is free flavor. It's like drinking sea monkeys

1124
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:05,989
Without having to pay though. It's free sea monkeys free sea monkeys

1125
00:55:07,269 --> 00:55:12,150
There you go this economy. You're gonna give that up. Yeah

1126
00:55:13,329 --> 00:55:20,099
The same roof it can be but it's a tank again. So we're gonna need to be forward

1127
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:26,360
Copy you need big damage this round in position feeling good ready for a battle

1128
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
We ready to battle

1129
00:55:29,239 --> 00:55:34,480
Want to be over here cuz they can heal off the refrigerator, but no, thank you, sir. All right

1130
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:39,590
Be careful fall damage does hurt. Hey, whoa

1131
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:45,510
Are you telling us cuz you've learned from experience or you just know about it?

1132
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:51,190
I'm just telling you because I've taken 20% of my health off every round because I just keep jumping off of the roof

1133
00:55:51,989 --> 00:55:59,489
It's a disaster. I don't know if you know this sometimes you're close to push me off. Oh, here we go. Okay, I'm activating my crits

1134
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:01,690
All right, let's go for it. We can melt this thing quick

1135
00:56:02,489 --> 00:56:08,460
Well, that wasn't quick crit canteen. Yeah

1136
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:14,750
Okay, we are fucking all right stop on the way

1137
00:56:15,469 --> 00:56:18,539
that was perfect placement of

1138
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:25,739
You know, I bet our heavies the medics can't move her. Yeah, I this is I can't

1139
00:56:26,619 --> 00:56:30,059
Scout I got it. I got it. I'm going to go. I got him. I'm going to going

1140
00:56:30,579 --> 00:56:36,139
All right. I got it. All I got it all. We're good. Watch me kill this heavy in fucking 10 seconds

1141
00:56:36,619 --> 00:56:40,989
Dude look at that. So good. You guys got the tank, right? Yep. Thank you. I got this guy tank

1142
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:47,369
Tank down good shit. Good shit. Wow a little bit money left

1143
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:54,820
Yeah, sentry buster coming up. Yep. Yep. Yep. Those things are so fucking loud. Oh

1144
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,579
Where is he? Oh

1145
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:11,940
Big heavy right around the corner. Oh

1146
00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:16,059
Doing a lot of

1147
00:57:16,059 --> 00:57:18,619
Shit. All right. He's over. He's over folks on the tank. I

1148
00:57:19,139 --> 00:57:28,530
Was trying to kill the medics break they could do it. Yeah focus the medics always because they will uber I

1149
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:39,469
I accidentally made them uber. All right, we got to focus on the tank too. I'm gonna move that gear up

1150
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:42,630
That's a good idea. I

1151
00:57:42,829 --> 00:57:44,469
Should get his tank

1152
00:57:44,469 --> 00:57:49,269
Or I will move that gear directly into a bunch pyro. Yeah tank is a tank should be fine. I think we're good

1153
00:57:49,789 --> 00:57:54,510
Where's the bottom graphic

1154
00:57:55,030 --> 00:58:01,750
Hi, that's a good point. What is the bottom graphic beam? I think the health of a certain the heavies walking the bomb back

1155
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:07,710
He's been walking the bomb back. I focus on heavy. He's he's around the right tank is down. Oh

1156
00:58:09,099 --> 00:58:11,860
God, he's right there. Nice. That was good

1157
00:58:13,139 --> 00:58:18,679
We didn't collect a lot of money though that we're about to get it. We're about to see a big bump. Nice

1158
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,800
huge bomb

1159
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:28,840
I mean you give me a tank and I and I say how high

1160
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:40,050
Does this run also have tanks it does and it also has permacrit soldiers

1161
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:44,969
So this is the time to buy that crit resistance crit resistance purchased

1162
00:58:44,969 --> 00:58:48,409
Is this a blast resistant group a fire group?

1163
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:56,019
This would be a blast resistant group as well as a bullet resistant group. Let me go. Let me do this

1164
00:58:56,059 --> 00:58:58,230
Let me do this. Ooh

1165
00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:01,300
There are no there are no tanks this round there are only

00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,300
Myself a tank drama to be honest

1167
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:10,179
That's like you got a notification. I think I find piss

1168
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:16,519
This is the final round or penultimate. I

1169
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,159
Think this is wave what wave?

1170
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:28,630
Way the seven waves in this one. This feels penultimate, but my math has never been good. It's got a penultimate vibe to it

1171
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:38,800
Let's get it. How we feel how we feel feel good. I'm feeling

01:02:50,519 --> 01:02:59,730
Up until then it's going pretty good. We're doing it's going great. I think we're champions

1205
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:04,460
Century buster and then that's it

1206
01:03:04,699 --> 01:03:06,039
Big heavy

1207
01:03:06,039 --> 01:03:12,639
All right, so you guys are coming up. Yep. I'm gonna lose this war

1208
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:26,019
I think it's just this big heavy big heavy has the bomb and it's coming up like the left side said press Emma

1209
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:33,019
Chat bomb is down. They said M for medic

1210
01:03:34,619 --> 01:03:39,309
It's a good guess oh

1211
01:03:39,309 --> 01:03:42,130
Come on. I got it. I got him. I got him. Good. All right, just the

1212
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:48,099
Soldier and that's it. I think there's like a few dollars and hanging out somewhere. Yeah

1213
01:03:50,809 --> 01:03:55,449
There's 50 bucks, there we go 24 what I mean who even needs money anymore

1214
01:03:56,170 --> 01:04:03,219
Yeah, we I need the better you die here jump speed. So this is this is this is it? This is the big one

1215
01:04:03,619 --> 01:04:06,300
three tanks

1216
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:08,300
Tanks, so just all right

1217
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:11,460
So us just to let everybody know that hasn't not really played MVM

1218
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:18,050
The scout is the money collector class and it's usually required somebody is almost required to do it

1219
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:21,449
You get healed when you pick the money up as a scout

1220
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:27,380
He also has like a big radius around him that picks it up for free, but we're at the last round

1221
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:29,380
I don't we're doing just fine

1222
01:04:29,659 --> 01:04:34,659
What should I get as an upgrade for the last round any any resistances like crit resistance?

1223
01:04:34,659 --> 01:04:41,800
Maybe there's one big crit soldier. The rest are all just big

1224
01:04:42,039 --> 01:04:54,360
I think our biggest problem is gonna be the tanks. I agree. This is a lot of last and bullet damage

1225
01:04:54,440 --> 01:05:03,900
I'm just gonna go resistance. I'm just gonna just max myself out. Are you having a smashing good time?

1226
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:07,989
I am actually I'm actually

1227
01:05:09,110 --> 01:05:13,489
Usually aren't so let me get a play a seven days a die. I

1228
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:21,010
Played oh, I played a lot of that one should do this question. They got a huge update question

1229
01:05:21,409 --> 01:05:24,170
What should I avoid here? Should I like avoid?

1230
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:28,090
Penetration or should I get some resistances?

1231
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,440
Resistance is a big deal now

1232
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:39,219
Because these are all pretty much everything we're fighting is big. So they'll kill you in two seconds

1233
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:46,099
You can never go wrong with move speed and jump speed move speed. Oh, yes, we're actually insanely important

1234
01:05:46,099 --> 01:05:57,760
I don't have any of it though. Are there crits in this one? There is one

1235
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:03,789
Giant crit soldier. So yeah, we should be able to get rid of it pretty quickly though

1236
01:06:04,269 --> 01:06:06,309
Okay

1237
01:06:06,309 --> 01:06:08,809
What about fire resistance?

1238
01:06:08,849 --> 01:06:11,090
no pyros, so fire is

1239
01:06:11,929 --> 01:06:13,929
not necessary

1240
01:06:14,289 --> 01:06:21,179
The only thing that we have is bullet and blast and crit use crits before shooting stickies got it

1241
01:06:21,179 --> 01:06:23,340
Thanks chat also to after we do this

1242
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:28,699
Everyone's gonna the reason why you use that that for duty ticket is because we're all gonna get an item after this and it could

1243
01:06:28,699 --> 01:06:30,460
Be something cool

1244
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:35,380
If anyone gets an Australian those sell for like one hundred thousand dollars

1245
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:43,300
What's an Australian it's like it like a human weapon. No, not an Australian. It's really young. It's an Australian. Oh

1246
01:06:44,139 --> 01:06:50,610
All right. I'm ready like a person. Yeah, I got a question like an actual person find the Australian. Oh

1247
01:06:52,429 --> 01:06:54,309
All right. What do we got first?

1248
01:06:54,309 --> 01:06:57,900
Probably tank. What does that mean?

1249
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:01,869
I'm big Scout

1250
01:07:02,070 --> 01:07:08,150
I'm gonna slow them. I'm gonna slow these scouts. I didn't do it

1251
01:07:08,510 --> 01:07:16,570
Oh my god, oh my god, he's they don't seem very slow. He's gonna go all the way. Oh, he's going literally all the way

1252
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:22,489
This one's on me. He's going to go all the ways. He's going for speed. Oh

1253
01:07:23,530 --> 01:07:25,849
He's going all the way, isn't he? Oops. Oh

1254
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:33,639
Save whoa, holy shit. That's what another one. That was my bad

1255
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:40,079
Wait, so it's not over. No, we're good. Yeah, we're okay. Oh, I just died for some reason. That's fine

1256
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:44,860
I didn't I need it to get me right on somebody should probably hang back in the kind of area

1257
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:48,840
Do you what do you think as a demo? Should I hang back or yeah, I need it against the tank

1258
01:07:49,239 --> 01:07:53,199
Cover that thing with stickies your bitch bomb for the bomb. All right

1259
01:07:54,659 --> 01:07:58,260
Big heavy on the right side. He's like pretty low though. He should be dead

1260
01:08:02,059 --> 01:08:04,059
Why'd you walk in a straight line at the heavy

1261
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:12,559
Yeah, that's a big gun heavy dead heavy dead giant charge shoulder walking over three three three homies

1262
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:15,570
Oh boy

1263
01:08:16,329 --> 01:08:18,329
Out of that tank

1264
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:26,340
Did you forget what I was playing oh, I don't know I thought I guess it just takes over your brain

1265
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:35,739
Don't kill me, please

1266
01:08:35,739 --> 01:08:39,880
Good. Oh

1267
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:44,920
Now the tank coming up. No, I reckon I can melt this. I don't know what to do chat

1268
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,920
I'm confused. Oh shit. Oh god, I

1269
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:49,710
Get you up. I don't know how to

1270
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:53,960
Scout's going left side

1271
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:58,850
All right. Yeah, I have a single scout makes it past. We're in trouble

1272
01:08:59,569 --> 01:09:03,170
All right, it's okay. One's okay now on it speaking which nice

1273
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:05,770
Actually help. Oh, please don't kill me

1274
01:09:06,130 --> 01:09:08,130
Nice. Okay, we're okay. I

1275
01:09:08,369 --> 01:09:12,460
Was the back right now?

1276
01:09:12,539 --> 01:09:16,260
I'm keeping an eye on the on the back with bombs right now. I can't help with the tank though

1277
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:21,500
I got a century, but there's like four scouts going on the point. Let's shoot

1278
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:27,300
Century back here should come to the point. I belong on this character. It's just cuz the shoes alone

1279
01:09:27,819 --> 01:09:34,630
As a reminder, you can press H when you die to respawn instantly. Oh

1280
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:38,350
Yeah for this round that sounds like a good idea. Oh, yeah, there's no

1281
01:09:39,189 --> 01:09:42,909
Okay, tank tank is coming. We gotta kill that tank like now

1282
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:46,050
What happened? There's a hole by the way heads up

1283
01:09:46,890 --> 01:09:50,289
There sure is there yeah, there is a hole that's right. I

1284
01:09:51,090 --> 01:09:53,090
Completely forgot about the one health

1285
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:54,810
soldier on the right

1286
01:09:54,810 --> 01:09:58,460
He's gonna stick on the tank with

1287
01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:01,220
All right. What's down? I'm down. I'm down

1288
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:06,779
I'm gonna respond immediately, but we got a problem with that bomb. That bomb is scaring me. I'll get the bomb

1289
01:10:06,779 --> 01:10:08,779
I got the bomb. Don't worry about the bomb focus on

1290
01:10:10,659 --> 01:10:14,699
Tank is down. Thank you. Thank is down. Okay down soldier on the coming up the other side. Excellent work

1291
01:10:15,539 --> 01:10:18,859
Loony tunes right there by crit canteens. We can't hear in there

1292
01:10:19,619 --> 01:10:32,399
Good. Okay. Okay. We got a second here where we can kind of relax. Yeah, we

1293
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,720
Snipers got this we got this. Oh

1294
01:10:43,069 --> 01:10:53,489
Watch it with a sniper scout. Nice. All right, huge soldier coming in with a bunch of scouts. He's very hurt

1295
01:10:54,090 --> 01:11:01,829
What side right or left? Uh, they come in the right butts. Oh, right. Yeah, it's weird

1296
01:11:02,829 --> 01:11:13,689
Teleporter that's not good. Whoa, what happened? What fuck what happened? Just one get through

1297
01:11:17,569 --> 01:11:24,899
It's the moment chat you could it was like a continue or vote restart no, we're good. Okay continue continue

1298
01:11:24,899 --> 01:11:28,100
Yeah, just go restart resets from round one. Oh, okay

1299
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:34,300
Cat you saw that could upgrade your character. You heard the trigger. Wait, how do you upgrade a character?

1300
01:11:34,859 --> 01:11:38,739
Wait, click your character icon you get movement speed and stuff. Yeah

1301
01:11:40,539 --> 01:11:42,909
Bullet resides a very important

1302
01:11:44,909 --> 01:11:48,560
Is there a lot of blasts in this one

1303
01:11:51,159 --> 01:11:53,159
This is very heavy on

1304
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,319
blast a lot of

1305
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:03,409
Infinite soldiers a big crit soldier, although there are a lot of bullet scouts

1306
01:12:03,409 --> 01:12:08,079
So we would that we did fine that time. I think we were good

1307
01:12:09,479 --> 01:12:11,680
I think once the bomb gets that close

1308
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:15,760
I'll just leave the level three back there and then and then you guys hold forward

1309
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:21,319
Yep, I had that alert was on screen for like a second and then I yeah, it was just too much too

1310
01:12:21,319 --> 01:12:22,800
It was too close

1311
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:33,520
Then you would have won if you use the frying pan. I get drunk back rage. That's the one

1312
01:12:34,039 --> 01:12:42,350
Um knock back is really good. It's it's actually insanely powerful especially versus century busters

1313
01:12:42,949 --> 01:12:45,510
Because you can just hold the

1314
01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:47,989
Just track them and they'll fly across the map

1315
01:12:48,590 --> 01:12:51,750
And that's very helpful for me because then I don't have to move my century around

1316
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:57,470
I know a lot of people right now are gonna say hey, don't listen to Jerma. That's a terrible strategy, but hey

1317
01:12:58,109 --> 01:13:05,229
They instantly said knock back halves your damage. He's so dumb. Don't get it. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Yeah

1318
01:13:06,109 --> 01:13:11,310
They're really upset at you. Why are robots attacking the Old West ghost town? Are we in it?

1319
01:13:11,590 --> 01:13:16,989
We're in it, we're in it to win it let's go I want to hear at least some enthusiasm from us. Okay, buddy. Yeah

1320
01:13:17,909 --> 01:13:22,489
Enthusiasm on three one. Oh, yeah, two three. Yeah

1321
01:13:26,539 --> 01:13:30,890
It's going all the way again

1322
01:13:32,729 --> 01:13:40,699
You're gonna go the distance is going for speed I am so hurt right now I was too busy doing a stupid fucking voice. Oh

1323
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:44,720
What oh, oh boy, okay. All right

1324
01:13:48,449 --> 01:13:53,920
Oh God, I did not want to drop down. Oh

1325
01:13:54,439 --> 01:14:00,920
Okay, left ubers left heavies ubered. I don't even know what to do about that right now chat. Oh, that was my fault

1326
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:02,920
I was supposed to kill the medics. That's my fault

1327
01:14:03,239 --> 01:14:07,220
All right, what have he's done? We just need left one. This is a huge pyro. Oh god

1328
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,760
Sorry, no over

1329
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:12,579
Someone keeps making them pop uber

1330
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:27,199
Back to a back to square one. Oh shit. Okay. There come the tanks

1331
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:35,920
I'm just getting bullied. Oh

1332
01:14:37,310 --> 01:14:39,149
I have a lot of

1333
01:14:39,149 --> 01:14:43,220
I'm gonna go focus on the soldier is pretty low, but I'm gonna focus on the tank in the money

1334
01:14:46,489 --> 01:14:50,770
Century buster is right here careful careful. I can focus tank

1335
01:14:51,409 --> 01:14:59,319
Give us all crits. I think bunch of people coming up. Oh, what?

1336
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:08,000
We're good, I can I can handle the scout guy this time

1337
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:14,020
I'm ready. I can slow him. I can knock him back at the start to I should do that

1338
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:19,590
I can also just leave my level three at the spawn for the start. That might just be the best

1339
01:15:20,630 --> 01:15:23,720
Yeah, this is a lot of scouts. It's just a ton of yeah

1340
01:15:24,279 --> 01:15:26,680
It's that beginning segment is a nightmare. I

1341
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:39,039
Doubters are winning. Yeah, we'll get it. Are they? Okay. Are the initial scouts running down the left or right path switch, right?

1342
01:15:39,039 --> 01:15:43,229
Um for faster damage in a pinch use your grenades. My grenades are weak

1343
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:47,909
If they haven't been upgraded by this point, they're not as good as this. Yeah

1344
01:15:48,229 --> 01:15:53,000
So what's that firing speed is glitched. You say you can't do a pass one. Is that true? Is this fake news?

1345
01:15:53,000 --> 01:16:00,229
I don't know that might be fair. Is that real? Mm-hmm chat. Is that real true? It's true

1346
01:16:00,229 --> 01:16:06,600
It's actually true only the second only the second tier is glitched

1347
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:15,140
So if you do three, it'll fix it. Here's three and beyond are fine apparently, so you'd have to do with two points in it

1348
01:16:17,970 --> 01:16:29,619
What's the sticky it's 14 stickies at a time, I mean we could try all sniper here if it doesn't work

1349
01:16:29,619 --> 01:16:33,880
Well, yeah, that'll that'll definitely work. Yeah, we will find a way to beat this

1350
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:39,369
I could also go scout or medic and we're totally fine. I mean, I don't know

1351
01:16:39,369 --> 01:16:44,729
I could also go scout or medic and we're totally fine. Everything we did was good

1352
01:16:44,729 --> 01:16:49,010
Let's ready up and we'll just kill the scouts. Amen. Amen. I agree

1353
01:16:49,090 --> 01:16:54,289
Why do you want is your Torian Lord hair and that person for at least a month? Oh

1354
01:17:00,699 --> 01:17:07,619
Shucks frankly, you almost had it the first time we just yeah, we were really close like we could have done that

1355
01:17:07,619 --> 01:17:13,760
That was that rage Luke. I think right-click. It's this whatever the special

1356
01:17:14,479 --> 01:17:20,000
Right better middle mouse, it's possible that it's not bound you might have to find it

1357
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:33,489
Let's do it, let's do it. All right. All right. This one's for real. I miss every hit

1358
01:17:34,189 --> 01:17:45,220
Okay, I wish I had put my sentry closer

1359
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:52,449
Great start great killer smart better

1360
01:17:53,170 --> 01:17:57,369
Don't shoot him. Don't shoot him. No shoot him. I got the thing on the medic

1361
01:17:57,890 --> 01:18:04,729
That's what I was supposed to do last time and I failed miserably that's that's sniper job because I could just kill all

1362
01:18:05,369 --> 01:18:09,210
The medics with one shot. Oh money doesn't matter anymore, by the way. So well, it does

1363
01:18:11,289 --> 01:18:15,109
What this guy just destroyed capitalism with one comment

1364
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:24,619
Kind of quiet I went around this side and see if I can oh shit

1365
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:28,300
Up is a sniper. Where'd they even come from?

1366
01:18:30,369 --> 01:18:33,720
Snuck in

1367
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:35,560
sniper down the road

1368
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:49,659
Thank him in he dodged. All right, two tanks back to back here. I'm gonna just focus on the scouts

1369
01:18:49,659 --> 01:19:04,319
I think I got them all nice good shit on the real well done. That was fast. Wow guys

1370
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:11,479
Wow, the character progression was really inside you the whole time or someone activated their hacks

1371
01:19:12,159 --> 01:19:16,060
All right, don't get cocky

1372
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:22,159
I'm raging this guy. I back him up all the way

1373
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:35,239
Okay

1374
01:19:35,239 --> 01:19:46,479
Sniper on the left and soldier coming in that soldier. I can't see I don't even know. Yeah, I can't see shit too

1375
01:19:46,479 --> 01:19:48,119

1376
01:19:48,119 --> 01:19:50,439
Nice use that. All right

1377
01:19:50,439 --> 01:19:52,760

1378
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:57,189
Yeah. Oh nice. We're killing him

1379
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:02,130
On the way up. Oh, we killed the

1380
01:20:02,770 --> 01:20:04,689
Oh, that was awesome

1381
01:20:04,689 --> 01:20:07,489
Well played. I mean we have him so stun lucked

1382
01:20:08,210 --> 01:20:15,430
Yeah, this is going way way better I don't know why

1383
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:20,390
That's sticky debt. That's sticky death

1384
01:20:21,029 --> 01:20:32,960
Gonna eat this. He's taunting. Hmm. Yeah, the weapon I have when I build a meter I taunt and I get a hundred percent crit

1385
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:36,430
Hell, yeah

1386
01:20:36,430 --> 01:20:40,270
There's a great weapon, but don't let don't tell anybody I said that though

1387
01:20:40,590 --> 01:20:45,979
It is the single most hated weapon in this game, which one?

1388
01:20:48,699 --> 01:20:50,260
Yeah, I don't have that one

1389
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:57,920
Are there medics on though? Oh, I have a lot of scouts a lot of scouts sentry buster as well

1390
01:20:58,439 --> 01:21:01,590
Wait, is he alive though? Oh, he's lost

1391
01:21:02,229 --> 01:21:07,670
Nice rocket jump out of there

1392
01:21:07,789 --> 01:21:09,250
Thank you

1393
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:24,149
Fuck. Oh scout. Yeah scouts fast. Shoot him. Yeah scouts, but it's hard to detonate these sticky back so soon

1394
01:21:24,430 --> 01:21:26,430
No, we're good. Now. We're good now was

1395
01:21:26,989 --> 01:21:30,140
It's weird. This is this is the this is it here. I

1396
01:21:30,699 --> 01:21:40,770
Gotta say guys

1397
01:21:40,770 --> 01:21:43,890
Great work. It's just an amazing time to be a gamer

1398
01:21:46,010 --> 01:21:48,850
With all the great games we have in the year 2023

1399
01:21:50,369 --> 01:21:52,369
F2 a library

1400
01:21:52,729 --> 01:21:54,729
All right, one more thing. We're good

1401
01:21:55,250 --> 01:22:00,630
We might get scouts that might be trickling out to be careful. This is it

1402
01:22:01,310 --> 01:22:03,189
Is the sentry buster alive?

1403
01:22:03,189 --> 01:22:08,899
Nope, my rage does not work against this tank

1404
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:22,670
Yeah, unfortunately, I pop the pop the bottles here. This is I'm celebrate

1405
01:22:23,229 --> 01:22:32,250
What another one they just keep coming?

1406
01:22:32,770 --> 01:22:35,449
I don't know any better. Hopefully somebody gets the

1407
01:22:36,050 --> 01:22:37,489
$100,000 item

1408
01:22:37,489 --> 01:22:39,489
Hell, yeah, okay. Oh

Yeah, do I get all of these? I just got my overlay. I got a hat. Well, you just got a hat. Yeah

1413
01:23:02,359 --> 01:23:04,359
I'm like eight of the shields. What is this?

1414
01:23:05,079 --> 01:23:07,560
You got to get the good stuff

1415
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:11,039
Is this good?

1416
01:23:11,039 --> 01:23:18,489
That is that's so funny. I have a robot running man. Yeah, that was fun. Yeah, that was great

1417
01:23:18,489 --> 01:23:23,569
That was actually say resume game. Yeah, how do you how do you guys feel you guys want to do?

1418
01:23:23,569 --> 01:23:25,569
Yeah, I'll do I would do oh, yeah. Oh, yeah

1419
01:23:26,010 --> 01:23:30,920
You could you could sway me to do a Mario for sure. You could do that. Yeah, it's a badge

1420
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:33,039
Rare but worthless

1421
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:39,260
Jay, I just was Jay and it's so loud like hemorrhoids. What?

1422
01:23:39,979 --> 01:23:49,159
All right. Thanks for playing man vs. Machine man up for more. See you guys next week. Okay, so

1423
01:23:50,659 --> 01:23:55,989
Blood you gotta put that hat on. Yeah, I'm ready for a swag off

1424
01:23:56,189 --> 01:24:05,130
So if we have time to do one more maybe maybe another. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah one more. This is this is good

1425
01:24:05,130 --> 01:24:08,930
It's good going. So I should be Scout. We miss this like I feel like that's what we needed last time, right?

1426
01:24:08,930 --> 01:24:17,619
I could scout I want I got it this time. I'd love to snipe. It would be so beautiful. So

1427
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:25,060
I enjoyed soldier before I can really determine what I want to do. I think I'm gonna have to open a crate to determine

1428
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:26,380
What that is

1429
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:32,880
Yeah, I just opened a handful. Let's see. How does how how does this how does this affect?

1430
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:39,920
Society, how do you get a crate? This is a affected society greatly over the years

1431
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:46,520
There's many studies have been done on it. They drop but you can go to the steam community market comm and buy like in bulk

1432
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:48,520
Which will actually do this

1433
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:56,090
Yeah, don't don't do it. Don't do it on stream. Whatever you do. I don't need to buy this. I'm buying two keys chat

1434
01:24:56,090 --> 01:24:59,949
I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna open the summer crates that I have. I don't believe in gambling

1435
01:24:59,949 --> 01:25:13,520
You know, I'm gonna I want a strange a flog stranger fire. I might have one actually look I'm opening something we get

1436
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:24,369
This is the dopamine chat. See we get come on poke. I'm good. I'm getting killstreak vaccinator kit. Nice

1437
01:25:24,930 --> 01:25:30,289
Cool. Nobody else said nice

1438
01:25:33,619 --> 01:25:35,390
GG

1439
01:25:35,390 --> 01:25:39,859
It was just crickets chat. Did I not buy the right key again? Oh

1440
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:49,119
It's the cosmetic. I just got the exact same thing twice. I'm done gambling is crazy. Oh, wait, you know what? That's fine

1441
01:25:49,279 --> 01:25:53,340
That's what I want. No. No, it's good. It's good. I got this watch chat look open with key

1442
01:25:53,739 --> 01:26:00,770
No, no. No, it's not wasted. I actually really wanted this. I'm serious. I want I got a cow mangler stranger fire

1443
01:26:00,770 --> 01:26:04,729
I'm playing with it. I'm bleeding so hard. I'm doing cow mangler cargo constructor

1444
01:26:04,729 --> 01:26:10,569
Oh a cow mangler can't hurt buildings in the robots and they're technically buildings. Are they wrong? Wait, it doesn't work

1445
01:26:10,930 --> 01:26:19,220
Somebody just told me the spy from TF2 is French. Is that true? Yes. Yeah. Yeah, we we

1446
01:26:21,460 --> 01:26:31,229
Frenchman and he goes I murdered your toys as well. Don't is that your French Jerma? That's my spy

1447
01:26:32,289 --> 01:26:35,310
French give me your French. Yeah, give me something to say

1448
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:41,220
And have it make sure it's not like oh you poop poop with his pants. That's what he's gonna

1449
01:26:41,220 --> 01:26:44,899
Yeah, I would like to for you to say in a French accent

1450
01:26:45,949 --> 01:26:55,050
Is is this really it? Is this all you have on the menu? How do I say that with a French accent?

1451
01:26:55,050 --> 01:26:57,890
Oh, I thought you wanted me to say it in French. Oh

1452
01:26:58,250 --> 01:27:00,250
Is

1453
01:27:06,109 --> 01:27:10,789
This it is this all you have on the menu is this all of you have on your menu

1454
01:27:15,029 --> 01:27:17,029
Phenomenal this all you have on your menu

1455
01:27:19,579 --> 01:27:22,140
His use are insane

1456
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:31,210
So what is this explosive explosive headshots? What sniper rifle is good for this game mode any wrecks?

1457
01:27:32,789 --> 01:27:41,350
I was at the default the hitman hit maker. So apparently is good. What do you think jarate as well?

1458
01:27:41,350 --> 01:27:48,020
Maybe throw some bizarre bargain would be really good. I do have that

1459
01:27:48,659 --> 01:27:54,619
Heatmaker would be pretty good bizarre bargain. I know my chance answering you heat maker. Yeah, everyone's spamming it and just

1460
01:27:55,739 --> 01:27:58,579
I'll do hit me hitman. I can you want me to go heavy?

1461
01:27:58,579 --> 01:28:01,220
I can go back I can go back to my old ways cuz I can go

1462
01:28:01,659 --> 01:28:04,300
Medic instead of engineer this round and then actually heal people

1463
01:28:04,819 --> 01:28:08,649
but we probably want a heavy or

1464
01:28:09,489 --> 01:28:16,949
Soldier y'all need to carry. I got it. You know, it's not you can't also go engineer super fun. Is it the same map?

1465
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:23,039
Nope, this is different. Whoa, this is much shorter. This map is a is very short

1466
01:28:23,039 --> 01:28:36,979
So this one is this one could be hard two soldiers bad any crits in this round. No, we could do two soldiers cool

1467
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:39,420
crits

1468
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:45,079
Wave one we should be. Alright, I don't think we need to buy too much. The cheaters lament is like the rarest items in the game

1469
01:28:48,899 --> 01:28:52,680
Why do I even have the cheaters lament, what does that mean?

1470
01:28:53,199 --> 01:29:02,970
You see what I think it means. You have a back then. No, it's just old. It's an exploit item

1471
01:29:03,779 --> 01:29:09,880
Everyone has that. Alright. Well, thanks for making me feel special chat. Everybody. Everybody has that dude

1472
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:16,180
All right, so they

1473
01:29:16,180 --> 01:29:20,600
This one is kind of annoying right because they can actually go up top up here

1474
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:33,869
All right, they can go through these now me standing here. They can't sure who's our engineer. We do not have one

1475
01:29:34,529 --> 01:29:39,380
So that could be that's not good too alarming could disable issue

1476
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:47,460
One sec, we do have a scout and we do have a medic. So I think we'd be alright

1477
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:57,579
I'm gonna purchase a crits Krieg because apparently I threw mine out. Give me just a sec. I love this thing

1478
01:29:57,579 --> 01:30:01,579
I don't know. Everybody hates when I play with this and you go. I do this weapon fucking sucks

1479
01:30:01,579 --> 01:30:05,819
Like take it off. I'm just like no which one cow made that

1480
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:13,399
This is punch heavies

1481
01:30:13,399 --> 01:30:24,739
What is man up mode? That means we use the ticket to play the game sick. Okay. All right, poke

1482
01:30:24,739 --> 01:30:30,329
Let's do this double soldier. All right, no NG. Ooh

1483
01:30:30,890 --> 01:30:32,289
big balls

1484
01:30:32,289 --> 01:30:45,699
Like that AC DC song big balls. Yeah, who's this guy flying around the map?

1485
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:53,170
Somebody's flying. Yeah, one of us

1486
01:30:53,770 --> 01:30:56,319
Who's scouting? Oh

1487
01:30:56,319 --> 01:31:04,149
The scout. Yep. I'm gonna have a money you guys like money. I heard get off this character though

1488
01:31:06,399 --> 01:31:14,590
Anytime you hear the whoo, that means you're gonna get healed every time you heard something. He's going through big Scout. Oh

1489
01:31:17,689 --> 01:31:19,689
Oh

1490
01:31:21,250 --> 01:31:23,250
Come on come on in right here

1491
01:31:27,970 --> 01:31:29,970
Because so old

1492
01:31:31,289 --> 01:31:34,850
Okay, I'm gonna switch off a soldier here, but I that was fast

1493
01:31:35,489 --> 01:31:39,649
What's wrong? Is that impressive chat? Oh

1494
01:31:41,529 --> 01:31:50,220
Shit, that was bad. No, let me try sniper one more time. Who's gonna engineer cuz I don't know how I'm too stupid

1495
01:31:50,260 --> 01:31:58,539
I could I could go NG. All right, this is better. I could do NG if you poke if you wanna play something else

1496
01:31:58,539 --> 01:32:00,539
I'll play in you

1497
01:32:00,739 --> 01:32:04,960
NG oh I can do

1498
01:32:07,479 --> 01:32:16,470
Okay, hey take a look at my wrench everybody this one is just but you know what it's possible I get from this game mode

1499
01:32:22,109 --> 01:32:25,710
Yeah, take a look at my wrench was a disturbing sentence I didn't think that's what you meant oh

1500
01:32:26,789 --> 01:32:30,949
The Sydney sleeper also increases piss cooldown, I understand

1501
01:32:31,470 --> 01:32:43,600
Yeah, we need more piss right now. I want the frontier justice. I'm ready. I am almost ready and headshot though

1502
01:32:44,399 --> 01:32:48,079
Ready to deliver justice. All right, I have crits Creek

1503
01:32:48,079 --> 01:32:51,119
Which means I'll give you 10 seconds of crips where you will just annihilate everything

1504
01:32:51,119 --> 01:32:54,560
So I'll give you the heads up when you do that, but then yeah, can we get a code word?

1505
01:32:55,199 --> 01:32:58,000
I mean, I would have thought the word crits, but maybe

1506
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:05,239
Bagels was a safe place the old teleporter in here probably right? It was the word bagel plus bagel. Yes bagel

1507
01:33:05,239 --> 01:33:08,880
Okay. All right, if I hear that I know to shoot I will not shoot until then

1508
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:12,020
Scream as loud as you can when you need it. It's the only way

1509
01:33:13,779 --> 01:33:15,779
Unless you do it Spencer's going right here

1510
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:20,979
Which is protected enough from the enemies, but oh, why is my health booming?

1511
01:33:22,189 --> 01:33:25,029
Medic medic does overheal gives you a little whoa

1512
01:33:25,989 --> 01:33:29,350
Pretty sick. Why is he going away?

1513
01:33:30,609 --> 01:33:32,250
Unless I'm healing you

1514
01:33:32,250 --> 01:33:34,250
Ludwig, I don't need upgrades

1515
01:33:35,529 --> 01:33:36,689

Rock-paper-scissors right now. You know, I rock-paper-scissors. Oh, yeah, that's G. Let's see it

1517
01:33:44,380 --> 01:33:46,380
$100

1518
01:33:49,060 --> 01:33:53,579
I'm the tf2 player here. It's bullshit. Yeah, if your chat was playing maybe

1519
01:33:59,869 --> 01:34:01,869
It was funny on my screen

1520
01:34:02,029 --> 01:34:11,739
We have a battle siren, there's somebody else's microwave going off. Oh

1521
01:34:14,470 --> 01:34:18,420
God, I gotta go get my hot pockets. Can we pause?

1522
01:34:23,979 --> 01:34:25,979
God this isn't going so great

1523
01:34:26,180 --> 01:34:29,000
What are you talking about? We're doing awesome. Oh, you guys are doing awesome

1524
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:35,159
What's wrong? I'm working through some things. Hold on a minute. I'm out of ammo. I know that was impossible

1525
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:37,680
Why did I go that far?

1526
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:40,029
Damn

1527
01:34:40,029 --> 01:34:45,909

1528
01:34:46,710 --> 01:34:48,710

1530
01:34:55,479 --> 01:34:58,439
Can see how I would have been nice to have that right now

1531
01:34:59,239 --> 01:35:03,079
You're gonna come back to life in a second. I am I am walking right now. We're gonna be just fine

1532
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:05,039

1533
01:35:05,039 --> 01:35:09,819
Bow for this mode. Honestly, you're not wrong. Check your bus center buster. Oh

1534
01:35:10,699 --> 01:35:15,420
Nice good shit

1535
01:35:18,029 --> 01:35:20,779
No

1536
01:35:20,779 --> 01:35:22,899
Wow, that was useless of me

1537
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:29,060
They were like getting stuck on this defense, sir. How do you accidentally press G? Was it a good thing? Cuz H is close

1538
01:35:29,899 --> 01:35:31,659
Scout

1539
01:35:31,659 --> 01:35:35,640
Don't let them do it

1540
01:35:35,640 --> 01:35:38,960
Got no ammo. I can't know where I got the world to go. Oh

1541
01:35:42,779 --> 01:35:47,430
Oh my gosh, okay, we're good. Oh my god

1542
01:35:54,390 --> 01:35:58,310
A plus I helped. Hey, well done everybody

1543
01:35:59,029 --> 01:36:02,359

01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:12,260
Lector pyros

1546
01:36:13,539 --> 01:36:22,579
Two-way teleporter. Oh, you have to get the refill thing every round to one time use. Let me try this again. Yep

1547
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:28,380
R with rifle to use your charge buff on the sniper. Oh, right, right. Okay teleporter

1548
01:36:28,380 --> 01:36:30,819
We'll take you both ways now if you want to go back

1549
01:36:31,420 --> 01:36:35,880
Full reload speeds probably broken. I don't know. Yeah

1550
01:36:36,479 --> 01:36:40,340
I'm ready

1551
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:44,390
Okay. Mm-hmm. Uh, hold on we get the take your time

1552
01:36:45,069 --> 01:36:50,789
Get high ground. So you're not shooting team problem with that chat is it's easier to shoot headshots down here

1553
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:56,420
Who is this person? You look cool

1554
01:36:57,420 --> 01:37:04,140
Third century speed upgrade is bugged. Hmm. I like your hat you thank you. It's on brand it is

1555
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:05,579
alright

1556
01:37:05,579 --> 01:37:09,350
Can you see we got a big boy? I can see

1557
01:37:10,869 --> 01:37:12,510
those medics

1558
01:37:12,510 --> 01:37:17,390
Only shoot those medics because they will just keep this heavy ubered for a full two to three minutes

1559
01:37:17,390 --> 01:37:21,149
If you headshot the heavy and you have the explosive headshots, you'll usually get the medics

1560
01:37:21,909 --> 01:37:24,659
That is so many

1561
01:37:25,939 --> 01:37:29,020
Bus I'm mega bus. Yeah, just keep going

1562
01:37:29,140 --> 01:37:30,220
Good

1563
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:35,020
Nice you you please

1564
01:37:35,380 --> 01:37:40,420

1565
01:37:41,100 --> 01:37:45,390
There you go. That's so fast. The game's just not even ready to load the next enemy. I

1566
01:37:46,229 --> 01:37:49,739
Do love this doctor

1567
01:37:49,739 --> 01:37:57,289
Curious where he got his license from but more of a doctor same deal. Oh

1568
01:37:58,170 --> 01:38:01,529
No, just just headshot him. No one else shoot him just headshot him

1569
01:38:01,890 --> 01:38:06,579
Look, I don't need a license to plunge my crits into your bagel. That's all Vinny

1570
01:38:07,420 --> 01:38:17,699
Spies, yep spies are going by his medic. Oh, I got spied. I got I got stabbed

1571
01:38:19,420 --> 01:38:26,210

Okay, I'm fine medic can I get a res whoa, nope, I don't

1573
01:38:39,890 --> 01:38:42,890

1574
01:38:44,729 --> 01:38:46,729
Around oh

1575
01:38:46,930 --> 01:38:49,170
There's no tank. Just that guy

1576
01:38:49,170 --> 01:38:55,609
Tank. Oh wait is now. Oh shit. Okay tank is now

1577
01:39:00,779 --> 01:39:03,859
Penetration you think chat? Yeah penetrator for sure. I

01:39:05,619 --> 01:39:16,180
Got a lot of crits now. Wow. I have to go back and buy shit. What am I doing? What?

1579
01:39:16,699 --> 01:39:23,140

1580
01:39:23,939 --> 01:39:25,220
Goodness

1581
01:39:25,220 --> 01:39:48,260
Max out explosive headshot. That'll be next. Okay. I got a second century now. That's fun explosive upgrade increases its range

1582
01:39:48,260 --> 01:39:53,090
That sounds awesome. All right, they're gonna be going pretty much both directions. So it doesn't matter

1583
01:40:03,329 --> 01:40:08,159
Someone said what the fuck is wrong with his fov

1584
01:40:08,659 --> 01:40:16,810
It's wrong with my fov. You want I can't see your screen if you want to change your fov you can do so

1585
01:40:17,170 --> 01:40:22,329
It's maxed out chat. It should be not I think 90s of max. Yeah, I maxed it out

1586
01:40:22,649 --> 01:40:29,170
Usually people when they say your fov for some reason they forget what fov actually isn't they're talking about your view model

1587
01:40:29,609 --> 01:40:35,970
Go. Oh, yeah, if you might have the weapons real small if you want if you're gonna change your view model in like the console

1588
01:40:35,970 --> 01:40:37,970
Just make sure you do that off-camera

1589
01:40:38,289 --> 01:40:49,319
Like hitting Tildo, you know, I mean, mm-hmm where you're century next to the dispenser, but then I can't do this medic. Are you okay?

1590
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:53,920
I see you in great distress Doug

1591
01:40:54,319 --> 01:41:02,899
Just a little scared. I have a tank phobia. Can we destroy this tank right now for real? No cap

1592
01:41:03,420 --> 01:41:10,869
There are nights and I'm like, yeah for real. No cappy. No cappy Barra

1593
01:41:11,470 --> 01:41:33,609
Okay, I'm gonna get down. I want to use my Chris sturdy get overheal by picking up cash

1594
01:41:34,850 --> 01:41:39,449

1595
01:41:40,449 --> 01:41:43,850
Over healed more than I should be able to I think you do. Yeah, okay. Oh

1596
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:52,220
Shit oh

1597
01:41:52,220 --> 01:42:01,729
Man, that was awesome. This is an arrow through my fucking head. Oh, yeah

1598
01:42:06,779 --> 01:42:16,279
God damn it. I had 40 fucking crits in that gun. I had I didn't know nobody even laughed at it. Oh shit

1599
01:42:18,279 --> 01:42:22,720
Wait, what are we supposed to be laughing at nothing? I'd be coming. I'd be coming. I

1600
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:26,760
Exhaled Oh sharply through my nose if that helps

1601
01:42:27,479 --> 01:42:36,140
That's good enough for me. Oh, I love this. Oh god still have a bagel push, dude

1602
01:42:36,140 --> 01:42:39,180
I don't know. We're just so well oiled machine. I'll hold your bagel pussy

1603
01:42:40,939 --> 01:42:45,350
Dude I'm so sorry. We have become such a a

1604
01:42:46,029 --> 01:42:52,840
Synchronized unit that we're gonna beat this in like 20 minutes. Are we capable of doing the real ones?

1605
01:42:55,300 --> 01:42:57,100
This is not a real one

1606
01:42:57,100 --> 01:43:00,739
This feels real to me. I don't know the harder difficulty. That's much harder. There is

1607
01:43:01,420 --> 01:43:03,420
What is this difficulty called?

1608
01:43:05,130 --> 01:43:06,649
Bagel pussy

1609
01:43:06,649 --> 01:43:11,529
There's an advanced and there's expert. I'd like guys for introducing that word into this game

1610
01:43:14,829 --> 01:43:16,829
That being said I am going to pop it right now

1611
01:43:17,630 --> 01:43:30,939
Big dem on the right. I got big guy. Nice. Very good. I'm just gonna throw piss at the tank

1612
01:43:30,939 --> 01:43:44,460
I don't think it worked. I don't I don't think I'm the most qualified to handle this tank

1613
01:43:44,539 --> 01:43:51,079
As a sniper also the dispenser I upgraded Spencer. So there's a big trail on it. Yeah, I've not I've never not had ammo

1614
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:57,739
Yeah, I think this might also be one of the easier maps because half the enemies like have melee right tank. What do you got?

1615
01:43:58,699 --> 01:44:06,770
All right, let's decide for handle it. Let's sniper handle. Let's leave

1616
01:44:07,529 --> 01:44:10,609
The tank can't even carry the bomb. What's the risk of letting it through?

1617
01:44:11,329 --> 01:44:14,130
It is a bomb is a bomb. It is a giant

1618
01:44:15,550 --> 01:44:19,840
A plus credit rate. Look at that

1619
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:22,840
Wow

1620
01:44:23,319 --> 01:44:31,539
Ready for hard mode. Yeah, to be honest. It's a bit of light work true. They don't know how hard hard is. Oh

1621
01:44:33,989 --> 01:44:35,989
The real game starts now

1622
01:44:37,579 --> 01:44:48,239
Two tanks this time. I believe it's two. Yeah. Oh this metal region. Is this other crits in this one?

1623
01:44:48,239 --> 01:44:50,960
Is this a crit one? This is yeah, these are punch

1624
01:44:51,979 --> 01:44:59,340
Holiday heavies, which they if they punch you you are going to just start laughing. Did you essentially just go?

1625
01:45:01,100 --> 01:45:03,420
Oh, thanks for explaining what laughing is I

01:45:06,939 --> 01:45:08,939

Fuck it up for me. It cleared it up for me. I wasn't sure if it's like a ha ha or heehee

1628
01:45:14,329 --> 01:45:17,250
I wanted to go see a doctor for that one. So he says it's just laughing

1629
01:45:17,250 --> 01:45:24,090
I left once and you had wait you had to see a doctor after laughing. Yeah, I don't know what it was

1630
01:45:27,439 --> 01:45:33,699
I mean, it's involuntary. So seeing a doctor was probably the right move. Mm-hmm

1631
01:45:34,420 --> 01:45:37,619
We ready to absolutely

Just restart. Should we start?

1667

Another wave another dollar I was thinking about we should probably just redo the whole thing. So we start the stream. Hey everybody. Welcome

1668
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:45,260

1672
01:49:19,430 --> 01:49:20,909
Heavy

Me is a heavy weapon. Yeah, I'm ready. I'm American

1674

Hey, it's me the heavy weapons guy. Yeah, they want to buy it the 29 hyperdrive

1678
01:49:54,640 --> 01:49:58,979
Damn gives a bubble or the good water. So I can't like a server

1679
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:03,720
That was very good, but I don't know who water is. You don't know what?

1680
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:13,319
Character just liked it. I just liked it. What is water look like to you based on that voice like if you had to guess

1681
01:50:14,319 --> 01:50:21,039
One eye is purple because he's got hit in the face and he's very he's got like a mustache and a lot of a

1682
01:50:21,560 --> 01:50:25,960
Like a five o'clock shadow. Yeah, and he's someone in my check. Can you draw that?

1683
01:50:28,949 --> 01:50:39,060
Peru dude, so cringe. That's him. He's got it. Did I I don't think that was even close. Wait?

1684
01:50:39,060 --> 01:50:43,680
No, I think it kind of was I thought is it? Wait, what is he from?

1685
01:50:43,680 --> 01:50:48,039
What is what Oh does have a mustache, but he's you know, he's a flying alien. I

1686
01:50:48,680 --> 01:50:50,680
Think he does he

1687
01:50:51,079 --> 01:50:55,279
Wait chat. Does he have a mustache? No, I don't think so

1688
01:50:55,960 --> 01:50:58,359
It doesn't look like Danny DeVito and Matilda. I

1689
01:50:59,880 --> 01:51:08,319
Think that's what stir described. Yes, sir. I think you saw Danny DeVito in Matilda and that's why you recently, right?

1690
01:51:10,239 --> 01:51:11,520
Yesterday

1691
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:21,689
Just can't get Matilda out of the brain. She's just like me. Did you know Danny DeVito directed that movie?

1692
01:51:22,529 --> 01:51:25,770
No, really very talented guy the director produced

1693
01:51:26,369 --> 01:51:29,649
I'm pretty sure he directed that. Yeah, that was a directorial movie for him

1694
01:51:30,289 --> 01:51:32,520
He's done a lot of

1695
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:34,279
Stuff that you wouldn't think

1696
01:51:34,279 --> 01:51:40,229
We are absolutely destroying this. Oh

1697
01:51:42,510 --> 01:51:45,130
I'm gonna hit you

1698
01:51:46,050 --> 01:51:50,770
I thought you're about to die. There you go. I'm feeling great. I'm feeling electric. I

1699
01:51:51,409 --> 01:51:57,399
Mean, we got to go to hard mode. This is a little too free for dollars somewhere

1700
01:51:57,960 --> 01:51:59,000
spies

1701
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,319
spies are

1702
01:52:01,319 --> 01:52:12,100
Here nice. Oh a spike on me. Nice. This one spot spy is quite nice poke

1703
01:52:15,439 --> 01:52:24,970
I'm not here careful. Imagine playing a spy a grown-ass man. Well, I use the focus the wrong time

1704
01:52:26,470 --> 01:52:32,029
Grown-ass person playing a game. It's so funny because that's probably like the hardest most meticulous class to play

1705
01:52:32,869 --> 01:52:36,630
You need like a certain level of adult intelligence, I think to be able to do it

1706
01:52:39,789 --> 01:52:42,109
I've been saying as much as I can lately

1707
01:52:44,310 --> 01:52:46,550
Imagine a grown-ass man doing that a

1708
01:52:50,680 --> 01:52:52,680
little bit of a

1709
01:52:54,399 --> 01:52:56,399
Heavies are going around the left side

1710
01:52:56,479 --> 01:53:00,140
Yeah, I seen him. We have the bomb though. Yes seen it

1711
01:53:00,819 --> 01:53:03,149
old news

1712
01:53:03,149 --> 01:53:11,590
Right. They keep saying here comes the spies. I haven't seen him. So someone's doing a great job on our team

1713
01:53:11,590 --> 01:53:13,590
Oh shit! There's a bunch of heavies going behind

1714
01:53:13,590 --> 01:53:15,590
In the middle. Is this a spy?

1715
01:53:15,750 --> 01:53:18,510
Holy shit, how many people? Oh, there's a lot back here

1716
01:53:19,270 --> 01:53:21,949
This person evil. I can crit you if we need

1717
01:53:23,750 --> 01:53:25,750
Are we alright?

1718
01:53:25,909 --> 01:53:35,090
Money somewhere money money money. Where's the money on this side? I got it. I got some money here. Oh god

1719
01:53:38,609 --> 01:53:45,729
Yeah, oh yeah, all right, this is it this is the hard one who's missing the nine

1720
01:53:46,729 --> 01:53:48,210
Wow

1721
01:53:48,210 --> 01:53:49,569
stir, I

1722
01:53:49,569 --> 01:53:56,010
Mean if you're the engineer standing on the roof shooting its guys in a totally random spot

1723
01:53:56,010 --> 01:53:59,649
You don't say that money dropped over there. I don't know to go get it. It's fair home

1724
01:54:00,250 --> 01:54:02,970
Imagine being a grown-ass man saying something like that

1725
01:54:05,489 --> 01:54:09,840
Talk about money

1726
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:16,720
I gotta do this. I gotta do this. All right, a lot of blast a lot of blast like what the blast

1727
01:54:17,439 --> 01:54:19,359
Any crits any critters?

1728
01:54:19,359 --> 01:54:30,960
Yes, any fire? No fire. Three tanks final wave. I think that's what I'm doing

1729
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:35,970
I think we're pretty much ready to rock and roll. Mm-hmm

1730
01:54:36,569 --> 01:54:41,630
Grown-ass team ready to bagel puss. Grown-ass men talking about bagel pussies still

1731
01:54:44,630 --> 01:54:46,630
Grown-ass men

1732
01:54:46,829 --> 01:54:49,189
Some grown-ass men playing TF2. What's going on?

1733
01:54:49,789 --> 01:54:52,470
Uh, this is what grown-ass men are meant to do

1734
01:54:54,189 --> 01:54:56,189
Well, I can't afford

1735
01:55:00,420 --> 01:55:07,460
Easy grease

1736
01:55:08,300 --> 01:55:14,939
It's gonna be like three tanks back to back to back a lot of medics just make sure we know that okay

1737
01:55:15,380 --> 01:55:19,229
I'm ready. I don't know about the rest of the people on the team

1738
01:55:19,789 --> 01:55:27,130
That press f4 when they're ready, I'm ready those feelings also already at this point, I believe remember you're not blinking

Let's try like the hardest mode 36 year old man. Yeah, give us the hardest mode

1814
02:01:45,989 --> 02:01:50,109
Yeah, come on like it was a lot easier because we didn't lose $400 around

1815
02:01:50,789 --> 02:01:53,750
But still they made fun of me for losing $6

1816
02:01:54,069 --> 02:01:56,069
Almost

1817
02:01:56,069 --> 02:02:02,229
Eight-year-old man by the way people in chat. You don't even know how yeah, that's it's me me and Jerma. Oh 38

1818
02:02:03,109 --> 02:02:09,470
And we can send this comp at the hardest one. They have this cop is not losing too many

1819
02:02:09,470 --> 02:02:15,739
I think if any I think we got what it takes to do the expert you want to oh boy

1820
02:02:15,739 --> 02:02:19,560
Oh, this guy thinks he can handle expert all of a sudden

1821
02:02:20,399 --> 02:02:25,840
Okay, all right, I just want to make sure everyone in the call understands. I'm trying to talk up the call

1822
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:34,199
He's saying that he's talking about how none of you can do it. I can do it. Oh Botswana

1823
02:02:34,199 --> 02:02:39,689
Hey, I mean, I'm here to I could do I could do it. I could try it

1824
02:02:40,329 --> 02:02:46,489
Operation gear grinder warning expert missions are much harder in all caps. This is written in the game

1825
02:02:47,050 --> 02:02:50,529
Advanced missions require all six team members to be strong contributors

1826
02:02:50,609 --> 02:02:56,539
So the fourth class is the demo man and the demo man has two primaries

1827
02:02:56,539 --> 02:03:02,340
He's got the rocket the grenade launcher, and he's got the sticky launcher. This sounds like a mode for some grown-ass men

1828
02:03:02,659 --> 02:03:10,470
Yeah, cute up for man up. We are grown-ass man up, bro. You look like don't Chocula ban that person for a fucking hour

1829
02:03:11,109 --> 02:03:12,729
Huh?

1830
02:03:12,729 --> 02:03:16,680
Actually, no actually don't ban that person. That's fucking cool. I'm into that

1831
02:03:16,680 --> 02:03:31,079
She is not playing dark and darker now. They can do update came out. Do you have to crash for me?

1832
02:03:31,079 --> 02:03:38,840
Oh, no, never mind. It didn't sometimes the loading screen looks like a crash if you were tabbed. Yeah, I was tabbed

1833
02:03:38,840 --> 02:03:45,359
I'm playing geoguessr. I we forget you've never played tf2 and you don't know how like buggy the game is

1834
02:03:45,880 --> 02:03:47,800
Old the code is

1835
02:03:47,800 --> 02:03:55,510
All right. So what what are our strengths take your pick? I'm a nasty little tank

1836
02:03:55,510 --> 02:04:01,029
I'm a dirty little tank. I can I can scout well, I can stay Scout

1837
02:04:02,310 --> 02:04:05,170
Yeah, I'm fine going mad again. It was fun

1838
02:04:05,170 --> 02:04:13,390
I kind of want to do walk and load demo that suck now or I could spy

1839
02:04:13,670 --> 02:04:18,979
I'll do sniper again. If you guys think it's a my chats like I should do so

1840
02:04:18,979 --> 02:04:22,859
I think our last team comp was efficient effective and fierce

1841
02:04:23,300 --> 02:04:26,750
That's my thoughts and then they end

1842
02:04:27,510 --> 02:04:42,659
Yeah, doing something a little goofy, but let's give it a try. Yeah, let's let's let's give it a shot, bro

1843
02:04:42,659 --> 02:04:47,039
You are throwing right now. You don't know that okay, you know

1844
02:04:51,310 --> 02:05:06,289
Turn off on scoping after shooting in the options might feel better. You believe they're accusing me of being high right now

1845
02:05:08,779 --> 02:05:21,039
Take excuse me. Yeah, excuse you any crits this round not this round. Maybe I just do

1846
02:05:21,640 --> 02:05:37,199
Chat, that's not what I need. I don't I seems kind of use that way. Can I use the cow thing now?

1847
02:05:37,520 --> 02:05:45,439
Go golfing the cow mangler. Yep. It's honest

1848
02:05:45,960 --> 02:05:49,319
So that that does not have any ammo you just have to recharge it

1849
02:05:49,319 --> 02:05:53,079
It does take a little bit extra takes a little bit extra time to read. Oh, but it doesn't work of my guy

1850
02:05:53,560 --> 02:05:59,899
Yeah, so that that would only be on the soldier. Oh, yeah, I'm not soldier turn on damage numbers

1851
02:05:59,979 --> 02:06:07,899
Do you guys have your damage numbers on or no? I see it. Yeah. Wait, how you see damage?

1852
02:06:07,899 --> 02:06:12,680
It's in the every time I shoot it goes and it shows me every little number a classic TF2 videos

1853
02:06:13,020 --> 02:06:17,369
We should uber charged

1854
02:06:19,060 --> 02:06:25,340
Hybrid night in MVM with an Omega L face. Well, you haven't seen it play out. Oh, this is a bad map

1855
02:06:25,340 --> 02:06:31,699
We should have done the other map. This is actually gonna be really fucking hard. It's gonna be hard

1856
02:06:31,699 --> 02:06:36,939
I want to pick a map that we already knew and there's only three missions on the hard one because they made this cool mode

1857
02:06:36,939 --> 02:06:42,720
And then they never supported it after that ever again. What I thought valve did that a lot

1858
02:06:42,960 --> 02:06:49,960
There was MVM came out then like two years went by and then they added up like omissions in one update

1859
02:06:50,220 --> 02:06:55,979
But there's a whole bunch of community maps for this that are pretty cool. And we all love it

1860
02:06:57,649 --> 02:07:03,649
Some road add some roguelike elements to it and boom, there you go. Yeah, they could just call it TF 2 2

1861
02:07:06,329 --> 02:07:09,050
CF charge money for it all over again live

1862
02:07:09,569 --> 02:07:17,010
Mm-hmm TF 2 2 would be good if 2 3. Oh

1863
02:07:19,039 --> 02:07:25,069
Wow, oh, whoa. Whoa, dude. I got a DM from uh, I

1864
02:07:25,710 --> 02:07:29,470
Got a DM from Cody Ko and he said I did the Billy Billy challenge

1865
02:07:29,529 --> 02:07:33,369
which I thought meant the NPC challenge because the streaming said Billy Billy and

1866
02:07:34,010 --> 02:07:37,770
And then he said I threw up at the end so he was trying to say the dug dug challenge

1867
02:07:37,770 --> 02:07:39,770
But he called it the Billy Billy challenge. Oh

1868
02:07:41,409 --> 02:07:44,289
That's your challenge

1869
02:07:45,090 --> 02:07:50,560
It's my challenge in the sense that I did it first I guess I didn't created it

1870
02:07:51,260 --> 02:07:54,779
Poking it. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's your challenge

1871
02:07:54,779 --> 02:07:59,539
It's your challenge in the sense that you created it did it first and popularize it and made the rules

1872
02:08:00,300 --> 02:08:02,380
You don't have much ownership. Gotcha

1873
02:08:02,899 --> 02:08:07,729
Yeah, I wanted to do it and I wanted to hire like three or four

1874
02:08:08,569 --> 02:08:10,409
massive bodybuilders

1875
02:08:10,409 --> 02:08:13,600
And just go do it and pretend like already spies

1876
02:08:14,680 --> 02:08:17,439
Already spies. Oh, yeah, they're not messing around

1877
02:08:18,159 --> 02:08:23,359
Behind you behind you just spin around spin around just okay. What? Oh, oh, there's a spy behind me

1878
02:08:23,359 --> 02:08:27,520
Yeah, no, there's there's a lot of it's all it what is going on? It's like ten spies

1879
02:08:28,520 --> 02:08:35,680
Yeah, it's a lot of spice it's the hard mode it's hard mode is what you how many spies are there what the insta-kill, dude

1880
02:08:39,449 --> 02:08:47,819
Look at the top and if you see the spy icon there, that means they're still spies. Oh, we don't a teleporter

1881
02:08:49,840 --> 02:08:53,359
So we do we always $1

1882
02:08:54,199 --> 02:09:00,590
No, we it only gets consumed when you lose like no no when you win. Sorry. Oh

1883
02:09:02,909 --> 02:09:07,880
Here we go. Finally, okay long enough. All right, go go go. Oh, that's

1884
02:09:08,880 --> 02:09:15,970
Shit

1885
02:09:16,130 --> 02:09:18,689
The heel guys we got to kill the heel guys class work

1886
02:09:20,909 --> 02:09:33,130
The hell is that working drama? These guys take extra melee damage. I forgot to say that because they have those. Oh

1887
02:09:36,840 --> 02:09:38,880
That was me. I was me

1888
02:09:39,520 --> 02:09:41,520
You piece of shit

1889
02:09:43,880 --> 02:09:47,399
Dude you got the double donk. That's right. You're throwing I'm fine

1890
02:09:48,840 --> 02:09:50,840
This is a terrible start

1891
02:09:51,039 --> 02:09:53,600
Snipers focusing on us across the way. Oh

1892
02:09:54,239 --> 02:10:02,489
This is nasty. This is nasty. I got crits when we need guys getting healed. We got to kill the healer

1893
02:10:03,250 --> 02:10:11,180
Trying to push the bomb back. All right, we're okay. Yeah, we just back seven and kill it one shot or no

1894
02:10:11,699 --> 02:10:15,920
Can you can you watch all the back step?

1895
02:10:16,920 --> 02:10:20,510
This is just wipe it

1896
02:10:20,949 --> 02:10:24,510
No some things you can one-shot some things like the big giant ones

1897
02:10:24,510 --> 02:10:27,189
I don't think you can they just do a lot of damage to them. Geez

1898
02:10:28,430 --> 02:10:31,149
I'm having a hard time on spy. All right

1899
02:10:32,390 --> 02:10:40,069
Nothing, but I got disoriented shit. Wait, you know

1900
02:10:40,750 --> 02:10:42,750
That's coming in. Oh, yeah, that's here

1901
02:10:43,430 --> 02:10:45,430
now it's here at

1902
02:10:49,449 --> 02:10:51,689
We're okay, I'm a dead man

1903
02:10:53,409 --> 02:10:55,569
For you, they're deep in our

1904
02:10:56,569 --> 02:10:58,569
Oh

1905
02:11:00,729 --> 02:11:02,729
This is over

1906
02:11:02,850 --> 02:11:06,670
Okay, I am going to take I'm gonna blame me. I'm gonna blame me

1907
02:11:07,510 --> 02:11:09,510
I'm gonna blame me. I

1908
02:11:09,710 --> 02:11:17,439
Did great. I don't blame Doug and I don't blame Doug. I'm gonna play. All right, let me so I think

1909
02:11:18,520 --> 02:11:28,869
Do bear charge. I think this is better. I got I'm gonna go Angie. We need those spies are frustrating

1910
02:11:28,869 --> 02:11:41,010
I wonder if I should put on this thing use Huntsman with lead arrows

1911
02:11:43,310 --> 02:12:00,119
All right, I can do this. Should I not be sniper? Should I be like another class to help? What are you feeling?

1912
02:12:00,119 --> 02:12:03,899
I don't know. What should I light them on fire?

1913
02:12:06,840 --> 02:12:12,340
You should just turn around. I row is every now and then I feel a little bit

1914
02:12:16,420 --> 02:12:21,750
Just turn that song on and every time it says turn around turn around

1915
02:12:26,109 --> 02:12:33,319
No, would you go to a concert if they did that and they just kept getting higher and higher for an hour

1916
02:12:34,979 --> 02:12:40,020
Like a shepherd's tone. It just keeps going who's playing up until the point. It's a dog whistle

1917
02:12:42,739 --> 02:12:44,739
Well, then that's a problem

1918
02:12:45,100 --> 02:12:48,500
Yeah this generation of like how cool we are

1919
02:12:49,020 --> 02:12:53,779
Maybe you just go you film that song on your phone like as a selfie and then you leave after it's over

1920
02:12:54,380 --> 02:13:00,520
Now that's the whole concert they don't do anything else they do the one. Oh, that's it

1921
02:13:00,520 --> 02:13:05,239
Oh, then you're good. You get four hours of that. They come on and they're like we understand that

1922
02:13:05,760 --> 02:13:11,279
This is the only thing anybody ever sings of our anything we ever have ever done. So we're just gonna do this

1923
02:13:11,840 --> 02:13:17,779
And then they get really mad. They're like, how many of you fucking assholes even know a single other lyric?

1924
02:13:18,279 --> 02:13:25,640
Yeah, besides turn around or how about this one our house in the middle of our street our house in the middle of our street

1925
02:13:25,920 --> 02:13:32,819
Our house does that same line not even the full song you did it three times and I'm upset

1926
02:13:34,140 --> 02:13:36,140
Would you want more or?

1927
02:13:36,460 --> 02:13:38,619
Spice spice spice. I can't stand

1928
02:13:40,460 --> 02:13:42,460
Yeah, those are all spies

02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:19,239
Let try to play conservative so I can get to the crits

1963
02:17:25,520 --> 02:17:29,280
Get that money money money money a lot of money on the right side a lot of money on the right side

1964
02:17:30,079 --> 02:17:37,200
Hmm. Oh god, we did it though. Yeah, we did it. We did it was stressful. It's pretty stressful

1965
02:17:37,680 --> 02:17:39,680
What did I need?

1966
02:17:39,760 --> 02:17:47,139
Honestly rage knockback rage would have helped maybe a little firing speed

1967
02:17:47,899 --> 02:17:52,420
If I have a little how long that you're gone. We actually did fine. Yeah

1968
02:17:54,040 --> 02:17:56,639
That was wave one

1969
02:17:57,920 --> 02:18:08,770
That's what's stressing me out about to get very stressful get bloody Karen. All right

1970
02:18:12,680 --> 02:18:19,530
Um, where do you guys want the dispenser where's the ideal location for

1971
02:18:20,049 --> 02:18:21,090
Um

1972
02:18:21,090 --> 02:18:27,290
Maybe this house somewhere on top of it. Where do you put it? Here's fine for me

1973
02:18:27,290 --> 02:18:29,290
It's probably safe here if you want to run back to it

1974
02:18:30,719 --> 02:18:36,860
Don't need the metal. I did this a full ammo case up here. I'll be good. I

1975
02:18:40,049 --> 02:18:42,649
Am RTG then you should put it here

1976
02:18:43,090 --> 02:18:49,510
So your back can be to the metal and you're not getting shot

1977
02:18:49,510 --> 02:18:56,559
You see what I'm saying? If you if you say anything to this guy, he just like shuts down

1978
02:19:00,319 --> 02:19:02,319
I'm okay

1979

Thought something was wrong with me for a second

1984
02:19:31,270 --> 02:19:33,440
These things just happen naturally

1985
02:19:34,040 --> 02:19:39,350
I was like, you know, I'm not a lot of medics. That's a lot of medic sir. Oh

Think you see the crate crate boxes up here or the the metals up here five coming again fucking this fire

2015
02:22:10,819 --> 02:22:13,299
Oh, I hate so much. But yeah, we did it

2016
02:22:15,180 --> 02:22:17,700
Nice and not bad. We got most of the money

2017
02:22:18,620 --> 02:22:20,620
German wars your refill station. Ah

2018
02:22:21,059 --> 02:22:24,620

2019
02:22:25,780 --> 02:22:30,139
But I will put it I'm gonna put it where that fence is next time where you were last time. Yeah, I like the fence

2023
02:22:52,260 --> 02:22:54,260
It's a little blast resistance. You think?

2024
02:22:55,700 --> 02:22:58,219
Yeah, it's definitely time to get some resist

2025
02:22:59,420 --> 02:23:08,219
Blast resistance for sure here. Yeah one jump and jump on the sign literal God spot. What really?

2026
02:23:08,780 --> 02:23:13,040
The red icon at the top means they're big ones, right?

2027
02:23:13,559 --> 02:23:23,659
Like the three red the three red I believe is crits. So those are the crates was the blue. Okay. Oh god

2028
02:23:24,540 --> 02:23:30,459
The blue outline is crits the red is just big and blue and red is big

2029
02:23:31,579 --> 02:23:33,889
Okay, hold on. I'm up. I gotta get up here

2030
02:23:35,010 --> 02:23:40,909
So I'm gonna put this this is gonna have a pretty big range be able to see how far is it?

2031
02:23:41,549 --> 02:23:43,549
Yeah, it's you can stay pretty far away from it

2032
02:23:55,309 --> 02:23:57,309

2036
02:24:07,829 --> 02:24:10,110
Raise into my eyebrows and my hair lightens

2037
02:24:10,709 --> 02:24:13,979
Yeah, that's that's normal

2038
02:24:18,809 --> 02:24:23,049
Summer brow bone sounds like a good like album name. I think Douglas

2039
02:24:24,770 --> 02:24:30,209

Your chance we might need help with the tank I think we're okay

2052
02:25:51,180 --> 02:25:54,260
I have two crits that I can pop if we need it Doug. I'm ready to heal

2053
02:25:54,780 --> 02:25:58,540
Where my gun is just not made for this device. Oh, they're okay. I got you

2054
02:25:58,899 --> 02:26:01,780
Oh

2055
02:26:01,899 --> 02:26:04,299
Yeah, I'm not I'm not doing damage against that fucking tank

2056
02:26:06,059 --> 02:26:07,739
Leave a pyro

2057
02:26:07,739 --> 02:26:13,389
I'm gonna I think I'll get crit just in time for this. Can we get up and shoot this tank?

2058
02:26:14,110 --> 02:26:16,110
We should be okay. Oh

2059
02:26:18,790 --> 02:26:24,469
That is whoa big heavy big heavy on the left right side. Yeah big with y'all hell

2060
02:26:24,469 --> 02:26:27,709
I got rage. I'm crit for it with some fun. I can push him back

2061
02:26:30,620 --> 02:26:33,260
I'm taunting it. Oh, wait, what? Oh

2062
02:26:34,020 --> 02:26:38,690
There's no way we lose this guy

2063
02:26:38,850 --> 02:26:42,340
Fuck you got me

2064
02:26:42,340 --> 02:26:47,299
Holy shit, we might die. Oh, I died. Oh, no. Oh, there's another heavy

2065
02:26:47,860 --> 02:26:49,860
Okay, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay

2066
02:26:51,020 --> 02:26:53,020
Left heavy left heavy focus

2067
02:26:53,139 --> 02:26:57,100
Heavy versus heavy. It's too much respawn time

2068
02:26:57,860 --> 02:27:03,420
This heavy needs to be killed. I think we're all right. You might die. I try to get like half behind the staircase

2069
02:27:05,180 --> 02:27:07,219
I died. It killed me. Oh, oh, thank God

2070
02:27:07,819 --> 02:27:10,239
Good job guys, and I need you now

2071
02:27:14,180 --> 02:27:18,139
That was tough, I think knockback rage is decent easy

2072
02:27:18,500 --> 02:27:35,709
Maybe I do this and then this no shit. Do I really even need metal?

2073
02:27:35,709 --> 02:27:39,430
Yeah, I do, but I need defense

2074
02:27:39,950 --> 02:27:48,030
For tanks you guys the heavy is usually the best at shooting at wall crits. Just throwing it out there

2075
02:27:48,030 --> 02:27:53,149
I don't want to be that guy. Look I do shoot it and then my chat my chat just my chat roasts me

2076
02:27:53,149 --> 02:27:56,750
Okay, so I'm just sitting here my chat goes you your guns literally resisted again

2077
02:27:56,750 --> 02:28:02,450
So you shouldn't be using that so like I'll tell endure if you what you're asking for me

2078
02:28:02,450 --> 02:28:07,860
Just to endure this this this punishment of being made fun of for using a gun. That's not very effective

2079
02:28:07,860 --> 02:28:16,829
I will I think you're doing just fine. I think you're doing good. Yeah, you are. I'm gonna change my position

2080
02:28:16,829 --> 02:28:19,430
I'm gonna go up. You just got to use goon tactics

2081
02:28:19,629 --> 02:28:24,860
I'm doing literally while live and they just go heavy does reduce damage to tanks. Why are you shooting at us?

2082
02:28:24,860 --> 02:28:30,739
It's ridiculous here like reduce damage is still more damage than it would be if you didn't shoot it

2083
02:28:30,739 --> 02:28:39,299
Yeah, we need all the damage we can get which I crit somebody else then when we're attacking tanks

2084
02:28:40,459 --> 02:28:42,270
I

2085
02:28:42,270 --> 02:28:48,479
Think you still crit the goat. I mean you were shotgunning it for a full like minute or so

2086
02:28:49,459 --> 02:28:53,379
Shotguns without crit do like a quick thousand. They're pretty good

2087
02:28:54,020 --> 02:28:57,100
All right, I

2088
02:28:57,899 --> 02:29:05,639
Prepared isn't it weird how it's always Doug. It was me this time dogs a thinker

2089
02:29:06,079 --> 02:29:10,659
It was me this we got this we got this we're just I just you know

2090
02:29:11,180 --> 02:29:13,180
Goon max just goon maxing

2091
02:29:13,819 --> 02:29:16,250
Apparently, we're we need a pyro pyro

2092
02:29:16,930 --> 02:29:29,049
For the tanks. Oh, we set it back here. Okay. Oh, well, I mean this one we're melting

2093
02:29:32,620 --> 02:29:35,700
Ludwig, please stop shooting it you do reveal you've reduced

2094
02:29:37,500 --> 02:29:40,700
You're shooting this right now you're it sounds like you're reading my chat

2095
02:29:41,420 --> 02:29:45,020
What are you doing? You do produce damage? Don't you know?

2096
02:29:45,659 --> 02:29:59,610
He doesn't know. Oh my god scouts. Oh my god. I

2097
02:30:00,170 --> 02:30:09,670
Need ammo. Oh good. I mean, I shouldn't be shooting the tank either, but it's it's something

2098
02:30:09,670 --> 02:30:12,590
It's a couple, you know a little bit of damage each time

2099
02:30:13,350 --> 02:30:18,729
Yo, let's focus on the people back there. Let's just get him. I got him. Oh, never mind. Okay all dead

2100
02:30:19,430 --> 02:30:21,430

To your right like you're a lot of them I

2104
02:30:42,950 --> 02:30:44,709
Pissed on the spies

2105
02:30:44,709 --> 02:30:52,319
Okay, they're all dead. I

02:30:52,319 --> 02:31:04,350
Was nice John Rick you don't know I'm trying to get a headshot. I'm one of these fuckers

2107
02:31:05,270 --> 02:31:17,739
Well, we're kind of killing it right now. It's good sniper down the road

2108
02:31:18,500 --> 02:31:32,659
A lot of tanks this round get the money. Oh, fuck. Nevermind. Not getting life. I have rage to push back a big guys

2109
02:31:33,500 --> 02:31:46,229

2110
02:31:57,590 --> 02:32:00,110

I am so fucking impressed

2113
02:32:19,020 --> 02:32:27,030
How do we do this shoot backwards fly thing cuz it's not working for me, huh?

2114
02:32:27,549 --> 02:32:29,030
What all right?

2115
02:32:29,030 --> 02:32:36,170
It is time to resist perhaps a little bit of blast, but he's blasters bullet errs fires

2116
02:32:37,129 --> 02:32:39,129
These are a lot of melee damage

2117
02:32:39,610 --> 02:32:42,219
crit melee and

2118
02:32:42,379 --> 02:32:50,520
All a little bit of blasting and some I do a little you do a little blasting

2119
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:57,709
Maybe hey, it's me

2120
02:33:02,549 --> 02:33:06,840
I think I got a good comp here

2121
02:33:11,879 --> 02:33:18,959
Doug I was I was watching your stream Doug and I saw you raid and now I'm seeing parks are with Doug. Please stop feeding

2122
02:33:20,159 --> 02:33:22,770
Yeah, there's a little side

2123
02:33:23,850 --> 02:33:26,409
Yeah, I'm noticing and I feel like you're losing

2124
02:33:28,889 --> 02:33:32,860
Do you know you can just raid people while streaming as many times as you want

2125
02:33:34,139 --> 02:33:40,940
No, yeah, you can just straight away. Why do they go? Where do they go? All right? Where do you it's like two Christmases?

2126
02:33:40,940 --> 02:33:45,260
It's like a divorce in Paris. I'm gonna send some beers over to Vinny. I'm doing all right. I'm doing all right wait

2127
02:33:45,260 --> 02:33:49,579
So if I don't I'm somebody here, they'll all go that way if you raid them

2128
02:33:49,579 --> 02:33:53,520
It'll put them in the chat, but then you're still live so then some come back, and then you can rate again

2129
02:33:53,700 --> 02:33:58,020
Right, just lose all your viewers, but it's funny. Who am I rating? Who am I reading right now?

2130
02:33:58,020 --> 02:34:02,969
It crew oh my chat member said you multiply the viewers it creates new people from scratch

2131
02:34:02,969 --> 02:34:05,229
We just all raid Vinny at the same time get him to like

2132
02:34:06,370 --> 02:34:09,750
Let's give any like 80,000 concurrent viewers. Yeah, I'm down

2133
02:34:11,069 --> 02:34:13,069
That actually

2134
02:34:15,350 --> 02:34:17,350
Wait, what are we doing this?

2135
02:34:18,350 --> 02:34:20,350
Oh

2136
02:34:20,989 --> 02:34:25,709
Not another car, oh shit, okay, wait wait wait wait. I don't have the ability. I can't move

2137
02:34:26,270 --> 02:34:30,110
That's bad for us next round. We need to do that somebody. That's so funny

2138
02:34:30,790 --> 02:34:39,200
Who wants to have like a shitload of viewers?

2139
02:34:39,200 --> 02:34:45,219
I mean listen I say I'm nervous about it, but I wouldn't like downright refuse it

2140
02:34:45,219 --> 02:34:47,639
Well, you'd have to send him back to somebody else though in the call

2141
02:34:47,639 --> 02:34:50,659
I can do that is like we don't need to get your permission

2142
02:34:51,579 --> 02:34:56,100
Okay, so here's how we're gonna do this so we'll all who else who wants to do the take in the first one

2143
02:34:56,780 --> 02:34:58,170
I'm

2144
02:34:58,170 --> 02:35:02,129
First one and then I'll pass it down to stir okay, so at the end of this round. We're gonna

2145
02:35:02,129 --> 02:35:04,129
Everybody's gonna raid Vinny

2146
02:35:04,209 --> 02:35:09,770
But Ludd you're on YouTube right yeah, this doesn't work for me. Okay, but I will I will laugh

2147
02:35:10,489 --> 02:35:14,530
That's fine. So people we're just gonna slide you a laugh in the background of this pool

2148
02:35:14,969 --> 02:35:20,129
Yeah, we definitely need you like tackling in the background. Oh, I'm gonna. I'm gonna create you once everybody's down on the ground

2149
02:35:21,889 --> 02:35:27,879
Damn these guys sped up yeah, I had there was a moment

2150

2155
02:35:55,940 --> 02:35:58,180
It's gonna be a very funny spot

2156
02:36:08,979 --> 02:36:11,870
Money getting pissed on a bit

2157
02:36:13,110 --> 02:36:16,629

He ran right by me. I

2174
02:38:00,040 --> 02:38:02,540
Need to do this. That's why I bought it

2175
02:38:03,059 --> 02:38:13,340
I'm gonna leave a mini sentry back here in case of what is left. What is even you lone snipers running through?

2176
02:38:21,510 --> 02:38:23,510

Like yeah, what happened here making me nervous. Oh, they're there oh

2178
02:38:31,020 --> 02:38:33,020
There's no way we can handle this wave

2179
02:38:33,459 --> 02:38:40,510
We got all the money

2180
02:38:40,510 --> 02:38:45,020
Yeah, Oh big scout on left. How come everybody's doing the leg?

2181
02:38:45,540 --> 02:38:50,469
Hey Ludwig, we lose because you

2182
02:39:00,739 --> 02:39:04,780
Good catch and I need you more than ever a plus

2183
02:39:06,379 --> 02:39:09,340
That was a cheap round they didn't give us much for that. Yeah

2184
02:39:10,139 --> 02:39:15,170
Nice. All right. All right. I've already raven. I

2185
02:39:17,180 --> 02:39:24,500
Don't understand. Okay, so we're gonna put we're gonna collaborate all of our viewers into one stream and then that stream

2186
02:39:24,500 --> 02:39:28,739
We'll just pass it to the next stream and we'll continue this forever. So we all have a hundred thousand viewers

2187
02:39:28,739 --> 02:39:30,739
We're gonna like break all of our

2188
02:39:31,979 --> 02:39:35,879
Records, I'm gonna materialize viewers. Yeah

2189
02:39:37,979 --> 02:39:44,969
It's just vine sauce, yeah, and then who's after me stir I think stir should be after everybody get in the car

2190
02:39:44,969 --> 02:39:50,819
You're going to Uncle Vinesauce house. All right, everybody go to go to Vinesauce. I'm raiding. This is very interesting

2191
02:39:50,819 --> 02:39:54,700
Let's see how I'm also doing it. Yeah, but your stream is still on you don't you know

2192
02:39:54,979 --> 02:40:01,860
You're still streaming. All right, I've sent him. Oh my god. Are we good? Okay, so I'm raiding Vinesauce. Yeah

2193
02:40:03,270 --> 02:40:15,399
Hey guys, I'm raiding Vinesauce. Oh my god. Okay, I think so soon coming in clutch with my gaming lifestyle

2194
02:40:15,399 --> 02:40:20,719
Okay, but here's this is this the last round? I don't know. Is it so at the end of this round?

2195
02:40:20,719 --> 02:40:24,899
You have to pass it to somebody else. I was gonna pass it like right away or should I do like

2196
02:40:26,100 --> 02:40:30,459
What do you what? Yeah, we're doing around because I'm not sure how much longer we're gonna be playing this

2197
02:40:30,659 --> 02:40:35,139
What round are we in right now? Five? Six?

2198
02:40:37,340 --> 02:40:38,780
Six out of seven

2199
02:40:38,780 --> 02:40:44,379
What we could do is we just keep passing the viewers along up until the round actually starts and that person just has to deal

2200
02:40:44,379 --> 02:40:50,979
With them during the actual game. Or how about just at some point after like a minute or two just pass it

2201
02:40:51,459 --> 02:40:55,780
During the game. I'll just pass it in like a minute. I hit a new record. You just got me to 25k

2202
02:40:55,780 --> 02:41:00,500
I think like 15 was my record or something like that. So

2221
02:42:49,129 --> 02:42:55,139
Okay, my raid button is actually laggy because of how fucked up my stream is right now by the way, it started

2222
02:42:55,379 --> 02:42:59,280
Yeah, and by the way, you guys are gonna be trapped over with stir with like five minutes of ads

2223
02:43:00,860 --> 02:43:07,159
I can't even I don't feel like I should do that when I guess I'm

2255
02:45:52,530 --> 02:45:54,530

2273
02:47:34,809 --> 02:47:37,049
They're sharing viewers around like that

2278
02:47:59,829 --> 02:48:05,840
Who am I reading? I'm reading viewers got lost in the void. They got lost in a pub

2279
02:48:05,840 --> 02:48:11,440
It's working even though I think I was already raiding Vinny. Yeah, we're getting like weird diminishing returns from doing this

2280
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
Yeah, this wasn't well, I

2281
02:48:14,479 --> 02:48:21,600

Kidding I didn't fall off. I was joking

2343
02:53:34,200 --> 02:53:38,510
Because the medic is also healing at like 10 times speed

2344
02:53:39,190 --> 02:53:42,520
Don't worry Germer, I'll help you refill your ranks. I

You know, why'd you read me again?

2361
02:54:50,989 --> 02:54:57,409
It must have been a glitch from earlier. All right, we're gonna raid Jerma here

50k on him. Oh, no, we need crits cuz there's six tanks

2367
02:55:22,530 --> 02:55:28,610
Yeah, we need crits, but they we didn't we are not worried about being attacked by crits

2368
02:55:29,209 --> 02:55:40,409
Let me just open my chat back up because I haven't seen it in like 20 minutes. I'm feeling very prepared for this one

2369
02:55:40,889 --> 02:55:47,979
I'm thinking it's a dub. Is this final round? Yeah, it's final round right wave seven to seven. I think this is it

2370
02:55:47,979 --> 02:55:51,610
Yeah, this is the big one

2371
02:55:52,770 --> 02:55:54,770
Maybe I should buy crit for me

2372
02:55:55,729 --> 02:55:56,729
I

2373
02:55:56,729 --> 02:56:00,770
Made it ammo. I'm am I was like what I always run out of crit canteens

2374
02:56:00,770 --> 02:56:04,129
And it's like a halfway through the mission you died by crit canteens again

2375
02:56:04,870 --> 02:56:10,569
Okay, if you're like have money and you're in spawn and I'll be where the fuck is my entrance. Oh, there it is

2376
02:56:11,579 --> 02:56:16,100
Someone came into my chat and just said how come ten minutes earlier. I saw Vinny at 31 K

2377
02:56:16,500 --> 02:56:22,979
Like they don't understand what happened. We've confused the chat gaslight him say it never happened

2378
02:56:23,979 --> 02:56:25,979
I mean

2379
02:56:26,459 --> 02:56:30,459
Okay, I'm gonna put my dispenser over behind this fence over here

2380
02:56:31,579 --> 02:56:36,360
somewhere raid stir

2381
02:56:37,840 --> 02:56:44,590
Yeah chat, I would always have 31 K if I didn't do the diaper chief it

2382
02:56:45,190 --> 02:56:47,190
Wait diapers. So I'll say diapers

2383
02:56:47,950 --> 02:56:51,469
Diaper chief in particular. It's a bit that my chat really really likes

2384
02:56:52,110 --> 02:56:55,549
What is it? Well?

2385
02:56:56,069 --> 02:56:59,209
There's a not ready

2386
02:56:59,530 --> 02:57:01,850
Seconds you guys ready in Metal Gear Solid

2387
02:57:02,770 --> 02:57:05,510
hmm

2388
02:57:05,510 --> 02:57:07,510
Do you know the DARPA chief in Metal Gear Solid?

2389
02:57:08,270 --> 02:57:10,270
What sure?

2390
02:57:10,670 --> 02:57:18,690
It it's the diaper chief. Anyway, let's kill that tank. Okay, I like it. You know what that deserves a rate. I mean, that's a good

2391
02:57:19,610 --> 02:57:21,610
Yeah, thanks, man

2392
02:57:22,129 --> 02:57:26,770
If you guys like diaper jokes and welcome over the diaper grown-ass man talking about diaper. Yeah

2393
02:57:27,049 --> 02:57:29,049
That's man

2394
02:57:29,129 --> 02:57:36,090
Diaper sauce Oh grown-ass man sauce. Hey, I wish I didn't say that about diapers. Can't talk about diapers

2395
02:57:37,090 --> 02:57:44,559
There are not many diaper streamers on twitch. So, you know, it's a niche that you got to fill like a diaper itself

2396
02:57:45,200 --> 02:57:49,079
Maybe not many like do you think there are some? Oh, yeah. Yeah

2397
02:57:49,479 --> 02:57:52,719
There's a few right? Yeah, it's a limited amount but

2398
02:57:54,239 --> 02:57:56,239
Someone's got a film we have ubered

2399
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:01,200
Far

2400
02:58:01,200 --> 02:58:07,829
Way, we're good, right? He's dead. Yeah, he's dead giving us a boost tank time

2401
02:58:08,629 --> 02:58:12,100
medics

2402
02:58:12,100 --> 02:58:16,120
like I

2403
02:58:16,120 --> 02:58:18,120
Got a tank you guys won't focus other thing

2404
02:58:20,819 --> 02:58:25,239
I'll create you now just to work on the tank. Oh, hey, man. Thanks for the raid

2405
02:58:25,920 --> 02:58:30,319
But it's weird that you'd raid me and we're all still playing together. I usually like in stream

2406
02:58:31,159 --> 02:58:36,000
Yeah, I think I'm gonna wrap it up here, okay, that's so fucking funny

2407
02:58:39,100 --> 02:58:43,979
Ending send our viewers to Ludwig like just tell them to go there. No, it's not possible

2408
02:58:44,860 --> 02:58:50,420
Well, we can just tell everybody to go twitch to YouTube is like the trail of tears of the social world

2409
02:58:50,819 --> 02:58:54,100
Well, so we'll be funny is like so many will be lost along the way

2410
02:58:54,100 --> 02:58:59,520
It's more and then they would leave and YouTube would go. Oh people hate this stream and start recommending it

2411
02:59:00,520 --> 02:59:02,879
Cool I'm gonna pick someone with three viewers

2412
02:59:03,760 --> 02:59:05,760
Pass it along wait you

2413
02:59:06,239 --> 02:59:13,430

We've been doing very well

2422
02:59:40,930 --> 02:59:47,440
It'd be really funny if we sent someone everyone to someone that we know and then told them that we expect them to be sent

2423
02:59:47,440 --> 02:59:49,440
back

2424

Subs will send all over we find a small viewer. Tell him. Hey, you want this big raid, but you only have it for 10 minutes

2426
03:00:18,989 --> 03:00:22,770

2434
03:00:58,879 --> 03:01:00,920
Cannot attest to that. I've been dripping sweat

2435
03:01:01,639 --> 03:01:08,680
Now you bit you can pull it and pull a bird big numbers. Love I've been watching you. I've been seeing what you're doing

See that I see you doing the jump spin down move. I've seen it

2437
03:01:13,319 --> 03:01:16,600
I do like I do to go with that. It's like stupid. Oh, it's like not even helpful

I'm just gonna shoot the snipers back there because they're annoying do it. Well, I think we got it

2441
03:01:43,540 --> 03:01:48,979
I think we do think so the the other mission remaining is I think considered to be the hardest one

2442
03:01:49,579 --> 03:01:51,579
Is that the like 99 wave one?

2443
03:01:52,950 --> 03:01:56,790

Forget the name of it

2445
03:01:59,989 --> 03:02:05,299
But it doesn't look like dust bowl. It's like a whole metal city. We did it. Nice job. Yeah
