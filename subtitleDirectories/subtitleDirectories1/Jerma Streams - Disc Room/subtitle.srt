1
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:42,740
What are these tags? What? Tags. Where do you see tags? English tournament arc. Dislikes goat cheese.

2
00:00:42,740 --> 00:01:03,859
The sus guy. Have I ever had a tag on this stream besides English? I hate that the sus guy is on here

3
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:10,629
because I feel like people really probably type that in and I don't want him finding me like that.

4
00:01:11,349 --> 00:01:24,230
These were added last stream. That's funny. We should change it to not the sus guy. Not the sus guy.

5
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:29,900
Stop asking. So people feel like, wait, he probably gets this a lot. This must be really annoying for

6
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:40,260
him. He probably gets that a lot. Anyways, hi. How are you? Good to see you. Gonna be playing

7
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:45,299
a video game today. I don't know why I think that's, I don't know. I don't know what's wrong

8
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:55,530
with me lately. Gonna be playing Disc Room today. It's a fun game. Somebody said, hey,

9
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,329
you probably found this because it was on Game Pass. Yes, that is exactly where I found it.

10
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,450
I played it on Game Pass for like five minutes and said, this seems like it's something I would

11
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:10,520
want to play and stream and have fun and just hang out. That's what we're going to do. Also,

12
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:16,439
I want to talk about something really quickly. Some very exciting news. I'm incredibly excited.

13
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,090
I will wait because I feel like a lot of you probably know what I'm going to talk about

14
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:32,759
already. We'll see. We'll give it a few minutes. I want people to know this. I have to tweet still,

15
00:02:32,759 --> 00:03:05,699
so give me one second. I'll be right back. All right. You guys ready? I think we,

16
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:10,099
maybe another minute or so. I'll talk about it a few more times over the stream. It's not like I'm

17
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:20,069
not going to say it ever again. This coming week, you will be able to see me on Ranboo's

18
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:29,500
generation loss streams. I'm going to be playing a pretty major part.

19
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:47,960
I have an accent, but yeah, I'm really excited for it. It's been something that's been in the

20
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:54,870
works for a very long time. I cannot wait to see the whole thing play out because it is a three-day

21
00:03:54,949 --> 00:04:10,939
event, May 24th, May 26th, and May 28th, 6 PM Eastern time. I'm going to be in it. You'll see.

22
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:19,449
I don't want to give anything away, but you'll see. Can you teach us how to beat box?

23
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:34,069
Yeah, sure. First, you go like this. Then you go like this. It's fucking easy. When are you going

24
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:39,829
to play Tears of the Kingdom? Never. Let's just get that out of the way. I want to say that because

25
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:44,230
then if I ever do play it, you'll be surprised. But if I don't ever play it, then I already told

26
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:53,319
you I wasn't. So let's just say that because then you're not expecting it. But who knows?

27
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:04,379
Yeah, a ton of time, a ton of efforts gone into this. I don't want to talk too much about it

28
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:11,620
because it's a very, very interesting, very intricate project. Just know I will be participating.

29
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:21,019
I cannot wait. It's going to be fun. We'll probably have the mods put up a sus for it.

30
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:28,250
Don't make promises you can't keep. Oh, I absolutely can make the promise that I'm

31
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:34,180
not going to play Tears of the Kingdom. I can promise you that, right? But like if it happens,

32
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:43,579
then whoa, what? It's Tears of the Kingdom. He's here. And I'll do a huge, elaborate, annoying intro

33
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:52,250
where I dress as Link and it's a full cam. And it's like, I play the song and it's like,

34
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,709
oh my God, he's going to play it. We'll make a whole thing out of it.

35
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:17,699
And I'll bring up the the Ocarina and I'll learn a bunch of songs for the Ocarina.

36
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:24,300
Dude, do you hate this game? Why? I'm not mocking it. I'm not. I'm not mocking. What are you talking

37
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:33,430
about? No, I don't. What am I mocking? No, I'm not mocking. This is not mocking. This is just

38
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:42,620
fucking around. I'm not. I'm not mocking. This dude hates Zelda. No, I don't. I'm not mocking.

39
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:59,480
The Ocarina is pretty easy to learn. Can you stop stalling and just survive the discs already?

40
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:06,889
Yeah, I get a few minutes. This is me time right now. I said this last stream too. This is me time.

41
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:19,220
My intros, the first 10 to 15 minutes of every stream, this is me time. This is me. This is for

42
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:33,350
me. But interrupting. Turn your cam on and do the rump shake. That's like kind of funny, but no,

43
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:55,540
not today. Just starts working. Not today. I don't know. Who knows? Maybe one day I'll do a

44
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:01,540
rump shake just like Tears of the Kingdom. I'm not planning on it. I don't have a plan to play Tears

45
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:13,050
of the Kingdom, but you might get a rump shake one day. You never know. Please don't. Don't. Don't

46
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:27,160
do it. I don't even know what that means. Does that mean what I think it does? Like just, I'm

47
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,879
just going to shake my ass. Is that what it is? That's what it is, right? It's just,

48
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:38,279
I'm going to shake my butt. That's it. Is there anything else to that? Or is there more to it?

49
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:57,000
Is it something else? What else would it mean? I don't know. I have no idea. Stop mocking rump

50
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:10,659
shake. Oh, okay. Here we go. All right. Here we go. All right. Let's play this game. I am to the brim

51
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:18,019
of excitement. There's things. There's so many things. I just want to scream it at you,

52
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:21,299
but we'll wait. We'll wait. We'll wait. We'll wait. We're going to wait. We have to wait.

53
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:37,850
But yeah, keep an eye on the sus. Keep an eye on, but he's do the roar. This is end of the stream.

54
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:54,779
I just turned it on. This is me time. Okay. Let's go. I'm, I'm turning it on. There it is. All right.

55
00:09:54,779 --> 00:10:01,240
This is disc room. And yeah, I did get this on game pass. I don't, I mean, it seems like it's

56
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:08,490
going to be really fun. This is a game about concentration. It's a game about, uh, keeping,

57
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:19,990
being good at dodging. It's one of the only things I can do. In 2092, a giant disc is discovered in

58
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:34,779
orbit of Jupiter. A crew of international scientists is sent to investigate. Oh, cartoon.

59
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:46,889
Left stick is move. I'm, this is going to be fun. You just have to live. That's it.

60
00:10:47,529 --> 00:11:05,450
The only thing you do game about precision. It's the, it's the sans fight. I guess it kind of is,

61
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:13,460
it is kind of the same undertale concept, isn't it? Kind of feels like I'm doing pretty damn good

62
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:23,080
already. This first room you would have, you would have died at five seconds. All right.

63
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:31,220
That's all right. All right. So survive five seconds. I did that die from four different

64
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:39,019
discs. I can go left or I can stay over here. Well, how do I get the, um, doesn't usually,

65
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:46,500
well, let me see. How do I start starting here again? Oh, I think I'm, I have to do tutorial

66
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:52,149
stuff. It's like asteroids. All right. Survive 10 seconds. That's all I have to do. I think it

67
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:57,799
usually shows the developer time, the person that made the game. Okay. I was looking at chat. Shut

68
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:12,519
up. Four seconds. Yeah. I, I got it. I already did. I beat it already. In fact, I should just

69
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:20,250
hurry up and get to the next room because this guy sucks at this. I just did it. I'm over time

70
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:36,179
right now. Opportunity right here. One, two. Oh, sorry. New best time. How does it, I think it's

71
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:43,879
supposed to show the dev time. How come I can't see that? Hold on a second. Let me restart this.

72
00:12:43,879 --> 00:13:02,679
How do I show that? Yeah. Dev team time. This says it's on. How come I can't see it? Yeah. See

73
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:21,210
ready? Look, uh, game. See dev team times on. It should be on. I can't do it. The devs never beat

74
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:31,580
this. It's not in the tutorial. Oh, okay. All right. So I already did this one. We can take a look at

75
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:36,149
the, take a look at this. So this is the game. This is the whole game. So kind of like the rooms

76
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:43,509
are connected. That's pretty cool. So we can go up. We're going to go up. All right. Die from four

77
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:53,590
disc types and survive 10 seconds. Easy. Let's go. That was just a practice one. See, I didn't get

78
00:13:53,590 --> 00:14:05,879
that move. That's why I couldn't do it. All right. Hold A to dash through discs. Here we go. See,

79
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:11,500
you give me one button that's a dash and an analog stick. I'm going to beat every single

80
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:21,480
fucking record in this entire game. Is this Omega gaming weekend? No. In fact, this is Omega short

81
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:34,889
weekend. This is exceptionally small weekend. That's all right. I'll take it. I'll take it.

82
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:46,039
Where should I go from here? I'm going to go up. Dude, you suck. I'm beating every level.

83
00:14:47,019 --> 00:15:06,120
I'm completing every level of man. That's all right. I didn't do it. Come on. Come on, man.

84
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:15,529
Nobody said chill, please. Are you talking to me? You're talking to the chat. I don't know who you're

85
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:26,710
talking to. Here we go. Oh, I want to talk about this. This is really important. This is food

86
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:31,429
related. So I know everyone's going to be really excited to hear that. I know at least 10 people

87
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:38,870
in the chat heard it was food related. So they just, yes, let's go. Okay. Let me ask a question.

88
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:45,820
I don't want to be rude. I'm trying. I'm going to try not to be. Can I go up? Oh, no, this is a dead

89
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:52,500
end. Oh, there is no complete this one. All right. All right. So here's what I want to talk about.

90
00:15:52,500 --> 00:16:00,340
I don't want to be disrespectful. I don't want to be mean about this, but there's anyone has

91
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:04,019
anybody in this chat and of all the 13 plus thousand people that are here right now,

92
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:13,299
13,000 of you, have you ever, ever bought heavy pulp orange juice? Any of you, a single person

93
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:22,230
in the whole chat, because honestly, I think, I think that's like my first test to see if you're

94
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:27,080
a psycho. If you drink heavy pulp orange juice, is that like, is that weird to say that?

95
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:38,419
I'm not talking about medium pulp. I'm talking heavy pulp, heavy pulp. One of the mods. Wait,

96
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:45,740
we are Josh. What the fuck, dude? I don't look, I don't mind pulp. Light pulp is good. Medium pulp.

97
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:51,100
But at some point it's, I feel like I'm drinking wet wood shavings in my orange juice. I feel like

98
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:59,029
I'm drinking bugs. It's heavy pulp is, is, is ridiculous. It's, it's sludge. It's not even

99
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:08,230
orange juice. I like pulp. Hope is fine. But too much of too much is, is too much. Wait, what

100
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:21,859
heavy pulp? It gets like stuck in your teeth and shit in a smoothie. All right. Yep. Okay.

101
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:27,690
All right. I want to say, I'm not seeing the dev times. I might have to restart.

102
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:34,309
That makes sense to me. I get it. All right. 10 seconds. Survive zero seconds or less.

103
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:44,779
Okay. So survive 10. I could see a smoothie because you want some of the actual orange in it.

104
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:53,799
I get that. But anytime I've ever seen heavy pulp get poured, it reminds me of sour milk,

105
00:17:54,680 --> 00:18:01,059
where you pour it and it's like, you know what I'm talking about. It's that like,

106
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:13,019
slop, slop, slop, slop, slop, slop, slop, slop. Fucking gross. All right. Survive zero seconds or

107
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:25,619
less. Did I do it? How do you, how do I die in zero seconds? It takes a second for it to spawn.

108
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:38,900
Did I get, I got it right there at zero, right? How do you, how do I die instantly?

109
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:50,940
Zero seconds or less. Hey asshole, I'm drinking milk right now. Don't ruin it.

110
00:18:53,980 --> 00:19:10,099
I just imagine you with a 24 ounce glass of milk. How 0.007. I don't think this is possible.

111
00:19:10,099 --> 00:19:22,630
Die from 15 disc types. All right. Well, this one, this one is a different one here. Yep. Any more

112
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:43,480
in here that count? Yep. That one counts. I gotta go left. Defeat the gatekeeper in 10 seconds. How

113
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:55,299
do I do it? Can I hit him? Oh, okay. I get it. This game is going to get,

114
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:03,079
when's the dog food tier list? What is the tier list that I actually wanted to do? I forgot to

115
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:17,670
bring it up. There's a tier list I want to do. What was it? Shit. Oh my God. This is going to

116
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:25,619
drive me crazy. What was it? No, no, no, no, no, no. I never talked about it. Shit. This is why I

117
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:33,880
write everything down. I just, I didn't write this one down. It'll come to me in a minute.

118
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:49,109
Oh, what? Oh, right. I wanted to, cause I saw the, the MK one trailer, which was

119
00:20:49,109 --> 00:20:58,890
fucking ridiculous by the way. Uh, I wanted to do a rate, put every like a tier list for all the

120
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:13,930
Mortal Kombat characters ever. That would be kind of fun. Do a Mortal Kombat character tier list.

121
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:20,170
Do it now. No, I mean like an, like a, I don't know, like six to 12 months. What does this do?

122
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:31,000
I still can't see the time played total deaths. Oh, it's keeping track of all this.

123
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:43,380
That'll be in a year. Oh, that's all right. All right. So I want to go up. It's keeping

124
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:49,769
track of my total play time. Do it right now. You weirdo. No, and like, like six or seven years

125
00:21:49,769 --> 00:22:09,400
or something. I have to last wait. Why is that not counting anymore? Oh, you have to stand in the

126
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:27,349
middle. I think I could do at least 30 seconds here. It didn't mean six to seven years. You're

127
00:22:27,349 --> 00:22:44,059
not even going to be streaming then I'm talking about on Mars. Oh, we're good. I'm still here.

128
00:22:46,569 --> 00:22:53,640
Oh, that had to have been pretty good. That had to have been pretty good.

129
00:23:04,329 --> 00:23:10,470
Don't have to die from, yeah, I have to be killed by a few different discs, right? 15. I haven't

130
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:22,099
been killed by this one. That opens one of the other doors and get over there. Yep. Oh,

131
00:23:23,619 --> 00:23:34,630
you have to pick one. I'll try slow best time. 30 seconds. I can do better than that.

132
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:43,369
That lasts a long time. Oh, it doesn't recharge. I think it does. This is way better than dash.

133
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:53,940
Maybe not. Oh, hold on. I can do better than that. What's this game? This game is called disc room.

134
00:23:55,349 --> 00:24:20,680
And you can get it right now on, you know, sound is good. No, it sounds great. What was my record

135
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:45,220
on this 30 seconds? Oh, oh, shit. I can do better than that. I have to beat the record here. Die to

136
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:54,730
the golden disc. That's actually true. That's really true. Are you ever going to do a beer

137
00:24:54,730 --> 00:25:12,710
drinking stream? No. Oh, all right. I did it. I need to go to undiscovered disc survived 20 seconds.

138
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:23,029
Oh, shit. I got to do that down here. Let's go. But you want me to like rate beers. I mean,

139
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:27,029
I could do that. I could. Do you want me to do a beer drinking tier list? Like where the,

140
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:40,390
where they belong? Okay. I don't know. I'll figure it out. I'll set it up. I'll figure that out.

141
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:49,619
God damn it. They're all going to be put in F. That's not necessarily true.

142
00:25:53,539 --> 00:25:59,059
I have to survive 20 seconds. There's probably another tier for a minute, too.

143
00:26:00,579 --> 00:26:08,839
Not just American beers. No, I know. I'm thinking maybe the top, the most popular three or four per

144
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:16,539
country. That's very doable considering that's probably four or five thousand different beers.

145
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:24,740
Sure. I got it. All right. I got to go right and up because this one is 20 seconds.

146
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:40,490
Armored gatekeeper. Best time 10 seconds. So how do I do 20 seconds here? Is that possible?

147
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:49,640
Survived 20 seconds. Undiscovered disc. How do I do this? I have to get 20 orbs. Oh,

148
00:26:50,680 --> 00:27:02,730
I thought he explodes after 10. Irma thinks there are like 20 countries. No, I just said

149
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:11,319
there was that was thousands of beers. Every country has its own beer. Every country has its

150
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:22,460
own beer that it makes. They all everybody makes a beer. Every country. I'm telling you every.

151
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:34,970
I got it. If OK, if you name a country and then go to Google and type in

152
00:27:36,859 --> 00:27:43,420
what is this country's beer, it's going to give you a like, oh, it's a 40 percent hop to say

153
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:46,619
flavored with pineapple extract. I don't know. It's going to be something.

154
00:27:57,049 --> 00:28:15,259
All right. Well, we can't let's just say most just say most countries. That's I mean, come on.

155
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:22,309
You can't you can't take literally. I mean, like I don't ever speak in literal terms. I'm speaking

156
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:32,119
in like most mostly terms like every country has got a beer. Oh, yeah. Well, what about this

157
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:36,119
country? This country doesn't have a beer. Yeah. All right. Well, maybe they do. Maybe they don't.

158
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:51,019
I don't know. Well, don't say that. Well, I don't know. Literal Andy, you said every. Yeah. But

159
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:58,660
like I'm sure there probably is something. Name me a country right now. Just I'm going to. OK,

160
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:10,650
let's let's I'm going to let's do a random country. OK, what is Spain? Spain's beer,

161
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:23,529
Spanish beer. Oh, interesting. What's Spain's most popular beer? It is called a San Miguel.

162
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:32,359
A San Miguel Classica is the most traditionally and best known among the Spanish population.

163
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:47,750
Would you look at that? What about Brazil? Brazil's beer? Here we go. What's the most popular

164
00:29:47,750 --> 00:30:03,829
beer in Brazil? Skoll, Brahma, Antarctica, Nova Shin. Huh? These are Brazilian beers.

165
00:30:03,829 --> 00:30:16,390
Come on. Those are craft Brazilian beers, and they're probably fucking wonderful.

166
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:28,869
OK, yeah, but not every. OK, not every single country on Earth will look. There's some countries

167
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:42,660
that this is not going to happen. Backtrack and Barry. No, it's called it's called nitpick.

168
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:54,740
Nancy is what we got over here. All right. I have to do this. I'm going to freak out.

169
00:31:04,009 --> 00:31:10,180
Shit. Why don't I look at Chad? Yeah, I mean, that's a lot of beer.

170
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:18,339
Maybe you know what I would do? Maybe the most popular beer from most countries.

171
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:25,369
I feel like, wait, I'll get shit faced. It's too muddy beers. I can't drink like 100 plus beers.

172
00:31:26,089 --> 00:31:32,099
If I take a sip out of 100 beers, how many beers is that? Can somebody do the calculation?

173
00:31:32,819 --> 00:31:40,900
Like if you take how much how many ounces of liquid is in one sip or two sips? And how many

174
00:31:40,900 --> 00:32:04,119
beers is 100 sips? I didn't even do it. You do it lazy. I'm playing a game. 10 beers is one sip.

175
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:22,490
Maybe maybe for some maybe for some YouTubers. Do you know who I've been watching lately? I just

176
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:32,740
like it's just I love it so much. It's a L.A. beast. It's just that his videos just go so wild.

177
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:46,819
They're just so they're just fucking outrageous. I never really watched much of his content,

178
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:54,740
but sometimes you just want to watch a guy eat like fucking 30 White Castle hamburger.

179
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,680
And he pukes. He like pukes like he pukes and like shits and some of these

180
00:33:13,589 --> 00:33:27,740
those are rookie numbers. No, they are not. Are you kidding me? I also have some more

181
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:35,990
interesting news to share with everybody to share with the class. I remember when I told you

182
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:43,579
that I had never had White Castle before. I did. I did have it. I have to get to 20 seconds.

183
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:58,869
I had White Castle. Let me tell you, I want to give it a rating. This shit was at least

184
00:33:58,869 --> 00:34:09,639
at least a B plus. At least. I don't understand the naysayers. It's like it's fine. It's good.

185
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:24,550
It's just yummy. It's just a delicious simple just little cheeseburger slider. Come on. I got it.

186
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:43,159
Shit. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. You know what? I'll give you. I'll give you a hot

187
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:48,840
take. I think a lot of people don't want to admit that they like simple things because it's like

188
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:58,789
makes them simple for some reason. Like, oh, White Castle. No, gross sucks. It's stupid.

189
00:35:00,469 --> 00:35:04,550
I almost feel like a lot of people, they probably do kind of like it, but if they say they like

190
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:09,909
something that's too simple, does that make me kind of like boring or something? No, it doesn't.

191
00:35:09,909 --> 00:35:17,849
It doesn't. Don't worry. Just eat it. Now, some of you probably really do think it sucks and that's

192
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:23,769
fine. And I know there's a lot of you that have eaten it that were, you know, maybe you were in,

193
00:35:23,769 --> 00:35:27,369
maybe you're in the car or maybe you got back to when your friends were all there and

194
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:34,570
y'all took a bite at the same time and two of your friends were like, oh, oh,

195
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:41,690
gross. And you were sitting there silently. I kind of like this. You were like, yeah, it's like,

196
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:58,199
man, whatever. It's too hyped up. Who was he talking to? You. I haven't admitted to you guys

197
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:02,119
that I liked the Venom movie. You know what I'm saying? I feel like it's kind of similar.

198
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:16,869
The thing is I didn't like the Venom movie because it was full of nutritional value,

199
00:36:16,869 --> 00:36:24,179
right? Let's use this as an example. I just liked it because the movie was fucking dumb and like fun

200
00:36:24,179 --> 00:36:39,420
and stupid and weird. And then it was like one of my favorite characters. So sorry. This is,

201
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:43,099
I'm addicted to trying to do this, but I just can't. I'm going to be quiet until I do this.

202
00:36:43,900 --> 00:37:03,769
Why did I, I didn't pick it up. Ollie is calling me out here. She's saying, but how did you get

203
00:37:03,769 --> 00:37:13,929
the White Castle? Yeah. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm in big fucking trouble now.

204
00:37:16,409 --> 00:37:20,329
It was the frozen shit from the grocery store and I still thought it was a B plus

205
00:37:20,329 --> 00:37:25,449
fucking hate me all you want. I don't care. Go ahead. Go ahead. You don't like me anymore.

206
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:38,070
You don't like me anymore. I never did. Oh, so if I had the real thing, would that be an A?

207
00:37:38,070 --> 00:38:14,579
I, I would still eat a hot pocket and go, that's fine. That one's unfair where it is. Got it. Let's

208
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:37,300
go. Nice. Feels good. Yes. It's okay. I got it. I got to go here because I need 20 seconds here as

209
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:48,579
well. Use the bumpers and triggers. What does that do? They kind of zoom in a little. Whoa.

210
00:38:49,460 --> 00:39:11,880
Wait, that's speeding the game up. Oh my God. Okay. That's, that's hard mode. Were you high

211
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:28,300
when you ate the frozen white castle? No, no, I was not. Was not, you know, time that first

212
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:44,070
enough for even asking that question. You know, like how dare you talking about drugs, talking

213
00:39:44,070 --> 00:40:06,619
about marijuana or something. Devil, the devil, devil, the devil. Oh my God. I have, I don't have

214
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:32,469
to get 20 seconds on every single map, do I? I kind of do. What saws have I not died to? Oh shit.

215
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:50,340
Come on. I got killed by the golden saw, didn't I? Do I actually get anything for doing 20 seconds

216
00:40:50,340 --> 00:41:12,869
on each map or is that just a bragging rights? Oh, that was close. Sorry. I got it. All right.

217
00:41:12,869 --> 00:41:19,460
So I got to go left and then up. What about down? What's down here? Survive? Yeah. Zero seconds.

218
00:41:20,179 --> 00:41:39,590
I don't get it. How do you die in zeros? Whoa. I know that's how got it. Cool. Okay. Really cool.

219
00:41:39,590 --> 00:42:00,460
What's this one? Stay sharp. I don't think I got killed by that one yet. I'm not actually quite.

220
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:10,309
I think the dash might actually be better, but feel more comfortable with this one. Wait,

221
00:42:10,309 --> 00:42:15,559
this is important. One of the mods trotter. I also checked out the beer thing. A sip is about

222
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:22,840
four milliliters and a can of beer is 12 ounces or 341 milliliters. One sip from 100 beer cans

223
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:35,210
would be roughly just a bit over one beer at 14 ounces. Really? Huh. One sip is about four

224
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:43,000
milliliters. I could probably do that then. The one thing that I'm afraid of, of doing that stream

225
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:53,179
is offending an entire country. You know what I mean? I definitely don't, I don't want to like

226
00:42:53,179 --> 00:43:00,059
do the, oh, the what country has the best tasting beer test. And some countries like they're ready.

227
00:43:00,059 --> 00:43:05,099
Oh my God. I can't wait to see. He's going to have our beer. I take a sip out of it. I'm like,

228
00:43:07,179 --> 00:43:19,030
I feel like that would really disappoint a lot of people. They all got their, their beer branded

229
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:25,380
hats on and they've got like a case of it. They're like, I'm ready. And then they have to question

230
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:29,349
everything. Well, no, actually this is fine because then they would just go, no, he likes

231
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:38,469
White Castle. Nevermind. We're good. They don't think this is all calculated. You don't think I,

232
00:43:38,469 --> 00:43:53,030
this is incredibly calculated everything I'm saying every day. Give me a little bit of credit.

233
00:43:53,030 --> 00:44:11,539
Frozen food tier list. That actually sounds kind of fun. I don't think this is even connected to

234
00:44:11,539 --> 00:44:27,860
anything. Shit. 20 seconds. Come on. Damn it. When are we going to get Otto's augtastic adventure?

235
00:44:28,659 --> 00:44:43,429
I don't know. I just thought of Otto. The trail is so long on these things.

236
00:44:43,429 --> 00:44:59,590
Almost there. Oh yes. Thank God. Okay. I got it. We got the whole bottom row cleared. Where should

237
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:08,599
I go up? I'll try to see what's the criteria. Ah, I have to die to three more. What have I not?

238
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:16,090
There are four disks in this room. I have not been killed by. Oh, but there's one that I haven't

239
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:48,889
been killed by. Which one? Second phase of this one. Ah, okay. Oh, you were right. All right.

240
00:45:48,889 --> 00:45:54,070
Cool. I've been hit by everything here, everything here, everything here.

241
00:45:54,070 --> 00:46:07,130
Is there one that I haven't been hit by? I think I got them all. All right. Let's just go up and

242
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:16,949
then right. Survive for five seconds. Easy. Protect your bowels. Dude. Don't do a frozen food tier list.

243
00:46:42,630 --> 00:47:01,769
I got to get at least 30 seconds on some of these. That was pretty damn good.

244
00:47:01,769 --> 00:47:09,190
I'll take that one. That's pretty good. Will you do an Arby's full menu tier list? No,

245
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:17,639
no, that doesn't sound like fun. I really don't think I would really even hate Arby's, but

246
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:29,989
no, it doesn't sound good. Survive five seconds in all unlocked rooms. Okay. Defeat two gatekeepers.

247
00:47:29,989 --> 00:47:34,409
And I'm already doing a pretty, pretty good job already. What? Die from this?

248
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:45,190
Okay. What about a Febreze scent tier list? That's the fastest way to get a migraine.

249
00:47:45,190 --> 00:48:08,090
What about an orange juice? Didn't you promise a BLT today? A few people are asking about it.

250
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:15,300
I love how that's what people are asking about. This community. I love this community. It's just.

251
00:48:16,099 --> 00:48:21,610
Hey dude, like, um, where's the BLT stream? Like I've just, we're just kind of curious about it.

252
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:26,090
We really just want to know like if that was bullshit or not, or if we should expect that or

253
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:31,719
I'm kind of waiting around to see. It's like, I don't know, man,

254
00:48:33,159 --> 00:48:47,019
but I don't, I don't like any of you individually. Okay. I like you collectively. Make that really

255
00:48:47,019 --> 00:49:28,340
clear. I just said, fuck you. Hey, he hates us. I didn't say that. You said that. I said that.

256
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:42,469
No, I'm just saying that. I mean, no BLT, dude. I mean, not right. Not today. Guys. I don't even

257
00:49:42,469 --> 00:49:51,659
have the ingredients to make a BLT. Doesn't that seem strange? But it's true. Think about the

258
00:49:51,659 --> 00:49:58,550
ingredients of BLT. I don't have them. I don't have, well, I mean, you need to sub roll. Oh no,

259
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:07,219
you don't. I don't have no bread. Now I need to go to the store. I don't have no bread, no bacon,

260
00:50:07,219 --> 00:50:20,519
no lettuce, no tomatoes. The only thing that's on a BLT that I own right now is mayo. They don't

261
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:27,320
have any bread. We just ran out of bread. It's not a infinite resource. You have to go and get it

262
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:34,280
again after you go run out. There's not a bread machine that's in your house that just, well,

263
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:48,469
you might make your own bread, but that's pretty cool. But it's not what I'm referring to. Just

264
00:50:48,469 --> 00:50:54,309
use the mayo, dude. So you want me to take a bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich,

265
00:50:55,190 --> 00:51:01,909
remove the entire sandwich, and eat a spoonful of mayonnaise. So why don't you just say what you

266
00:51:01,909 --> 00:51:22,090
want me to do? Bro, eat a spoonful of mayonnaise. It would be funny. Childish. That was pretty good.

267
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:32,340
I have 10 seconds. Is this, oh, this is a gatekeeper. Uh, you can kill me though.

268
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:38,250
You can kill me. Okay. There's one more disk in here I need to die to.

269
00:51:42,409 --> 00:51:52,730
Okay. Mayonnaise is your entire diet. I mean, you make one jokey food pyramid joke

270
00:51:53,449 --> 00:52:05,530
and everybody thinks you eat mayonnaise with your hands out of the jar. Is that the one I have to,

271
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:29,500
well, let me beat it first. Also the ad campaign that a lot of mayonnaise is doing right now,

272
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:36,570
they're doing kind of like the Reese's campaigns. Like the kind of like, sorry, not sorry. Not sorry.

273
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:46,820
Yeah. Mayo. Not sorry. It's like, it's just mayonnaise and I like it. I don't care. Oh,

274
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:50,820
those of us that like dip our sandwiches in mayo. I don't do that. I love mayonnaise,

275
00:52:50,820 --> 00:53:10,230
but I don't do it. Not sorry. No, stop. Why are you so dramatic? I'm just kind of messing around.

276
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:28,820
Who's that? Hey, can you wish me luck? I got finals tomorrow. You do. You do. You do you.

277
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:51,219
No, I can't. I was going to say you do as best as a job as you can. God damn it. You do.

278
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:55,829
You, I can't tell you, you're going to do good. I don't know what if you didn't study.

279
00:53:57,449 --> 00:54:02,739
I don't want to be responsible if you don't do well. Do your best. I hope you'd fucking studied

280
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:21,480
for it and get at least a C or a B. You'll be all right. You do you. It wouldn't be funny

281
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:40,260
if it wasn't true. You know what I mean? Why not A? Because you can't tell somebody to get an A.

282
00:54:50,969 --> 00:54:56,170
You can't say, hey, yeah, get an A. No, that's too much pressure to have to think about.

283
00:54:57,050 --> 00:55:06,139
Get an A? Get a near perfect score. What? I'm sorry. I'm of the opinion.

284
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:11,460
You don't have to have a perfect score. You just need to know the information.

285
00:55:12,179 --> 00:55:19,929
There's a difference between retention and memorization. You understand? Retention,

286
00:55:19,929 --> 00:55:27,500
knowledge retention is incredibly important. Knowledge memorization. Is it really retention?

287
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:49,400
High horse Andy. You know what? You do you. High horse Andy. High horse Andy would be me saying,

288
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:53,400
I got A's in every class. Therefore you should too. I'm way smarter than you.

289
00:55:54,119 --> 00:56:00,840
That is not what I said. That's not high horse Andy. That's me saying I got C's and

290
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:28,309
I don't give a shit. Bad role model. Your role model should be like fucking Abraham Lincoln and

291
00:56:28,309 --> 00:56:42,760
shit. Not me. Your role model should be like, I don't know. Wait, what's this? Clone yourself.

292
00:56:49,659 --> 00:57:09,750
Oh, that's kind of cool. Dude, pick somebody that's alive. That's true. That's true.

293
00:57:10,309 --> 00:57:20,460
Okay. Can I keep pressing it? How many times can I do this? I feel like this is cheating.

294
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:43,750
Oh my goodness. That was only nine seconds. Oh, every time I spawn one, I lose a second.

295
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:53,989
That's the trade off. Okay. I get it. All right. We're going, we're going back to the other one.

296
00:57:53,989 --> 00:58:19,460
I like this one better. 20 seconds. Can you please explain the stream tags? Hates having enough

297
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:48,280
fiber. I don't know. I, the mods have access to this. They do whatever they want. Oh, whoa.

298
00:58:49,400 --> 00:59:01,909
That was really cool, but I didn't get 20. You don't like goat cheese. I very, very, very much

299
00:59:01,909 --> 00:59:13,800
don't. I, goat cheese to me is, and it's so, I hate it. If I ever am out at a restaurant or something

300
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:19,079
with a bunch of people and hanging out and somebody gets like a goat cheese appetizer

301
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:25,579
and everybody's eating it. It's like, I, I don't want that. Or there's like salads or something

302
00:59:25,579 --> 00:59:31,059
that has it on it. And people see that I'm doing the thing where you take the knife and you just

303
00:59:31,059 --> 00:59:48,489
scrape it off to the side. I just don't, I must have my, my DNA must be different than yours

304
00:59:48,489 --> 00:59:53,130
because you know what I mean? Like we must have a completely different, however, like the food DNA

305
00:59:53,130 --> 01:00:05,579
part of your brain is because I find goat cheese to be absolutely revolting. And I mean, and, but

306
01:00:05,579 --> 01:00:09,980
I like blue cheese and you think that that, a lot of you think that's absolutely revolting

307
01:00:13,139 --> 01:00:23,340
and that's all right. I think blue cheese tastes like yummy, creamy deliciousness. And I think

308
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:28,869
goat cheese tastes like dirt, like a soil out of the ground, like a spoonful of it in your mouth.

309
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:47,909
Shit. I need 20 seconds. You only like blue cheese to be different. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

310
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:52,869
One of my favorite flavors on all right. I'm shutting that person down. That person needs

311
01:00:52,869 --> 01:01:01,829
to get that person needs to get shut down right now. Blue cheese and hot sauce is my favorite

312
01:01:01,829 --> 01:01:08,230
flavor combination in the world. If you have, if there was a flavor tier list, no, sorry. It's not

313
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:17,940
blue raspberry. Stupid. It's, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You do you. All right. That's the end of the

314
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:41,639
story. All right. In real talk though, I would put blue cheese and hot sauce at over S and it's

315
01:01:41,639 --> 01:01:53,300
probably the only thing that's there. Why are you being so strange? I don't know. Just fucking around.

316
01:02:00,389 --> 01:02:08,039
Now I don't put it on everything. I, I like blue cheese where I think blue cheese belongs.

317
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:15,690
I think blue cheese belongs on Buffalo chicken, a Buffalo chicken sandwich with blue cheese on it

318
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:24,920
is unmatched. It's undeniably unmatched. It is the best single probably food item in the world

319
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:29,960
is a Buffalo chicken sub in the world. And I really don't think anything can compare to it.

320
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:39,480
The second thing on that list would be a perfectly cooked piece of salmon. That's number two.

321
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:55,269
That is way above blue raspberry. And we're talking flavor, like flavor profile. I don't put blue

322
01:02:55,269 --> 01:02:59,269
cheese on salmon. No, I'm saying that, that, that what we've moved on to a different topic,

323
01:02:59,269 --> 01:03:10,099
a different flavor. Where is mint on that list? Very low. Spear mint is, is okay. It's high.

324
01:03:10,099 --> 01:03:18,860
Peppermint is, I like peppermint tea, but I think mint is it's a, I don't hate it. I don't love it.

325
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:26,039
I think it's fine. I like Spear mint. Oh, Holy shit. You guys need to know this. I have to tell

326
01:03:26,039 --> 01:03:30,840
you this and I don't care. You can call me like, like brand shill Andy. I don't care.

327
01:03:32,019 --> 01:03:41,539
Do you want to know what the best hot sauce in the world is in the world? I got killed by,

328
01:03:41,539 --> 01:03:48,699
Oh wait, I can go down here now. Yep. Best hot sauce in the world is Tabasco,

329
01:03:48,699 --> 01:03:56,070
but it's a very specific Tabasco. It's one that I have not had. Oh, and I just burped a little,

330
01:03:56,789 --> 01:04:04,059
it's one that I haven't. Ooh, this is weird. It's a different flavor of Tabasco. Are you ready?

331
01:04:06,949 --> 01:04:21,050
The Tabasco Habanero sauce is un fucking believable. It is probably the single greatest hot

332
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:27,719
sauce ever invented. Trust me. It is, there's a lot of truths here and I'm so glad. I am so glad

333
01:04:27,719 --> 01:04:50,420
that a lot of, you know, Tabasco Habanero is, it makes everything better. Everything. Did somebody

334
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:54,980
say you've definitely never had it? What? Why would I say I love it? That's weird.

335
01:04:55,780 --> 01:05:12,179
I can absorb a disc. It's really hot. Old A to absorb. I said, I've never had it. What?

336
01:05:12,179 --> 01:05:21,900
You just said you'd never had it. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What's going on? Wait, what's happening?

337
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:30,619
You've never, I've never, this, you, can somebody give me a clip or something? I said, the bottle's

338
01:05:30,619 --> 01:05:46,860
gone. I haven't had it. Somebody clip me. What? You definitely said that buddy. That means you're like

339
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:50,380
mad. If you say buddy at the end of a sentence, that means like you're pissed at me. What? I'm

340
01:05:50,380 --> 01:06:13,159
serious. Like when did I say that? I don't see a clipper. He's not had it. So it's one. Yep.

341
01:06:13,159 --> 01:06:17,800
Best hot sauce in the world is Tabasco, but it's a very specific Tabasco. It's one that I have not

342
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:33,320
had. What? Why did I say that? I'm so confused. I feel like, I feel like you edited this clip

343
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:37,400
and made me say that. Well, I had to have been talking about something else. Best hot sauce in

344
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:43,239
the world is Tabasco, but it's a very specific Tabasco. It's one that I have not had. I, I think

345
01:06:43,239 --> 01:06:49,639
what I was trying to say is it's one that I haven't talked about. One that I have not said, I think is

346
01:06:49,639 --> 01:06:56,489
one that I have not said. Had, yeah, I said that completely wrong. It's okay. Best hot sauce in

347
01:06:56,489 --> 01:07:00,969
the world is Tabasco, but it's a very specific Tabasco. It's one that I have not had. One that I

348
01:07:00,969 --> 01:07:08,650
have not said on stream or had till recently. That's what it was. Yes. That's what it is. Thank you.

349
01:07:09,210 --> 01:07:12,579
It was one that I've not had till recently. I got cut off because somebody made fun of me.

350
01:07:12,579 --> 01:07:16,820
It was the one that I, because I, I, me and Holly just started eating it like over the last month

351
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:23,400
or two. That's what it was. Somebody called me a fucking name. So I had to pause for a second.

352
01:07:25,159 --> 01:07:32,019
Um, but yeah, it's one that I haven't had till recently. That sounds so stupid out of context.

353
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:45,849
All right. But yeah, it is unfucking believable. It's really hot though. The habanero Tabasco is

354
01:07:45,849 --> 01:07:53,960
the kind of sauce where you eat it and it hurts. It's ha ha, but I think it's tolerable.

355
01:07:53,960 --> 01:08:06,360
If you don't think habanero is tolerable, it is very hot. The other one. Um, oh shit. I've had

356
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:15,980
also the, I think it's, what is it? The, the scorpion sauce, whatever it's called. It's,

357
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:22,789
it's red. It's a bright red Tabasco, um, scorpion or something. That one's really good too,

358
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:29,479
but that one is really, that one's like dangerous. That one hurts a lot.

359
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:48,859
One drop of that is really painful, but it's really good. He's eating bugs. All right. I got 20.

360
01:08:51,659 --> 01:08:57,350
What was the hot sauce? It was Tabasco habanero. It's hot. It's really hot. So don't fuck around

361
01:08:57,350 --> 01:09:11,430
with this stuff. Both of them are. I might get a minute on this one. I did not absorb it. Oh,

362
01:09:11,430 --> 01:09:25,989
well we can go right. I'm going to go down. Yeah. The, uh, the habanero one, it's interesting

363
01:09:25,989 --> 01:09:44,170
because it's got like bananas, mango, tamarind in it. It's good. Is there any pulp in it?

364
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:47,930
There's a little bit of bits, nothing much though. It's pretty clear.

365
01:09:48,729 --> 01:10:19,220
You ever have the ketchup one? I've had Tabasco and ketchup before. It's good. Shit. Oh God. Okay.

366
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:49,260
Where are they going? Oh, oh man. It's over. No. Yes. Okay. I'm good. 30 seconds. Oh my God. I'll

367
01:10:49,260 --> 01:11:01,739
try. I remember you would probably bail Willy Wonka's chocolate factory tests. No, I wouldn't.

368
01:11:01,739 --> 01:11:06,229
I'm not touching anything there. Are you kidding me? I don't know what the fuck is in it. All that

369
01:11:06,229 --> 01:11:13,510
shit. Never last and gobstopper. It never ends. Why? What's in it? Well, that's a secret. I don't

370
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:18,520
want to put that. I'm not putting it in my mouth, Willy. It's a secret. It lasts forever. Why? I

371
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:31,529
don't, I'm not eating that until I know what's in it. Listen, Bill, I'm not putting that in my mouth.

372
01:11:32,090 --> 01:11:39,699
I want to see the ingredients list. What kind of preservatives do you have in there? The high

373
01:11:39,699 --> 01:11:52,739
fructose corn syrup in that too, Bill? Yeah, that's what I thought. Uh, how would I do this?

374
01:11:53,460 --> 01:12:19,859
How are you supposed to beat this one? Survive for 10 seconds. Maybe with the clones. This is. Oh,

375
01:12:19,859 --> 01:13:27,020
okay. Slow. Dude, this one sucks. Wow. Okay. Shit. Come on, man. I had it. I'm alive. Damn it. I

376
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:57,609
didn't have any left. I got it. Nice. Thank God. 20 seconds on this one. No way. Not a chance. I

377
01:13:57,609 --> 01:14:16,840
almost had it. Not this one too, right? No, we're okay. Oh, that's kind of helpful. I wanted to get

378
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:27,859
hit by the discs. That was unpleasant. Yeah, it kind of was. I don't think we have to do it again,

379
01:14:27,859 --> 01:14:40,390
though. How's the garden going? Probably get some updates there in the next, uh, next week or so.

380
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:58,149
Sprouts have, uh, have crested the dirt. I know people really asking about the beetles, but, uh,

381
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:14,329
I don't have them. Let's take it slow and I should get this one fine. I might get a minute on this

382
01:15:14,329 --> 01:15:49,109
one. This one's probably the easiest one of the whole bunch right now. Let me get a minute. Nice.

383
01:15:50,199 --> 01:16:12,260
Very nice. Oh, just keep going this way. We're good. Get all the way down, all the way down.

384
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:37,350
Let's go for two minutes. Clean. Right there. I can't use that anymore. I gotta wait like 10

385
01:16:37,350 --> 01:17:15,130
seconds or so. Oh, this could be it. No, I might get it. That's it. 146. Damn it. Do this one now.

386
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:28,760
All the way down. All right. Star map. Have you seen all the memes about your stream getting

387
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:37,050
nuked the other day? Yeah. Yeah. And now there is a hard limiter on my computer. I, that ain't

388
01:17:37,050 --> 01:18:10,409
happening again. Ever again. What's the deal with this one? Absorb it? Maybe. I generally hope you're

389
01:18:10,409 --> 01:18:16,970
not too stressed out about that. It sucked. I had it on really loud, but I haven't, I still don't

390
01:18:16,970 --> 01:18:22,779
know what happened. I, I, dude, I went, I did a full like diagnostic of my entire audio equipment

391
01:18:22,779 --> 01:18:29,939
and system. Nothing. Nothing. But there's a limiter on the stream now. I ain't having that

392
01:18:29,939 --> 01:18:36,760
happen again. Yeah. I've seen a lot of the memes and it's fun to laugh at them, right? Cause like

393
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:41,510
one of the things that we said is it sounded like somebody shot a grenade launcher into my room.

394
01:18:41,510 --> 01:18:46,789
It's just like, it does. It really does. It sounds like I was like, it sounds like I was

395
01:18:46,789 --> 01:18:54,539
fucking like somebody threw a grenade in here, but you gotta be careful with that kind of shit. That

396
01:18:54,539 --> 01:19:00,439
shit is not good. And whether it was the game or the game communicating with the computer or

397
01:19:00,439 --> 01:19:06,810
something, I don't know, but I ain't, that can't happen again. It was, that was fucking crazy.

398
01:19:07,750 --> 01:19:15,939
What do I do here? Whether it was a rare, incredibly rare bug in devil may cry three

399
01:19:15,939 --> 01:19:26,970
HD collection. I don't know if it is a rare bug like that though. Whoa. Whoa. Really? Like,

400
01:19:26,970 --> 01:19:38,220
holy shit. That's, that's ridiculous. What do I do about this? I woke up laughing the next day

401
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:45,659
because it was so funny. I'm glad people think it's funny, but at the end of the day, that's,

402
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:50,220
you're going to be careful with that kind of shit. Maybe clones. Oh, I got to do.

403
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:13,430
It is clones. You haven't had a limiter this whole time. I have a limiter on my voice

404
01:20:14,390 --> 01:20:21,609
and I usually have, so I have a thing where the audio is not supposed to go over a certain

405
01:20:21,609 --> 01:20:28,729
threshold through OBS, but it, it went, it went through that. And I think it's because the amount

406
01:20:28,729 --> 01:20:35,689
of sounds that were happening in a row, it didn't matter. It like went over the threshold, but now

407
01:20:36,329 --> 01:20:45,100
I have it, I have it baked in. So that should be impossible now, but what a ridiculous bug.

408
01:20:45,739 --> 01:21:20,409
I did it. Best time. Is that? Oh, I got it. I have 120 seconds. That one's going to be hard.

409
01:21:21,529 --> 01:21:29,909
Ooh, I can just teleport. That's helpful. All right. This one's long time. Wait,

410
01:21:33,850 --> 01:21:49,770
how does this work? How do I add time? This thing just, all right, this thing just turned on. That

411
01:21:49,770 --> 01:22:12,020
was weird. Why did this one light up? Do I have to circle them? Clones maybe stand in both spots.

412
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:44,489
Let's try it. No. Yeah. When they bump it into the walls, it's when it's activating and I've

413
01:22:44,489 --> 01:22:56,739
changed that. Can I move them? Can't make them change direction. I don't think I can absorb the

414
01:22:56,739 --> 01:23:18,260
gold ones. Trying to do it right now. No, maybe I need a new power. This one's 20 seconds. I didn't

415
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:30,489
do. Let's change that. This one. I like this game. Are you breathing so weird? You can hear my

416
01:23:30,489 --> 01:24:10,899
breathing. Oh my God. Breathing stream overlay, but there's like a little, like a little balloon

417
01:24:10,899 --> 01:24:31,930
in the corner that inflates when I breathe in and deflates when I breathe out. I got it. What do I

418
01:24:31,930 --> 01:24:58,710
need to go to the left room? Oh, it's from here. 120, 10 seconds. We can do that. Had to die to

419
01:24:58,710 --> 01:25:08,899
that. You have to die to every single saw. Don't forget that. That would make it way easier for me

420
01:25:08,899 --> 01:25:16,489
to be in sync with your breathing. Please do that. Plus two. Oh, you're the reason why I'm not going

421
01:25:16,489 --> 01:26:00,600
to do it now. Hey, you do you. Yeah, you do you. I didn't even get it. Do a silent bob impression.

422
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:29,670
That's why I didn't even read that because okay, there you go. 20, 20. Let's get 20 right here.

423
01:26:29,670 --> 01:27:04,569
Let's get 30. Yeah, that's what we call split second decision making. Whatever. This one's 10

424
01:27:04,569 --> 01:27:26,090
seconds and feed. Feed what? Well, I'm going to die to this. I think I have to go inside of the

425
01:27:26,890 --> 01:27:48,920
mouth. No, I would have met. Okay, it is. Yep. Feed it four times. Wait, what? That didn't count.

426
01:27:53,979 --> 01:28:15,720
I get it. I get it. Wait. Okay. Yep. I have to pick up four of these. Get them both. Yes. All

427
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:26,409
right. That's it, right? Oh, my goodness. All right. We're fine. That's not it. It was four.

428
01:28:32,949 --> 01:28:57,130
Yeah, I got it. All right. Now it's going to drive 10 seconds. I need to do your stand up.

429
01:28:57,130 --> 01:29:06,260
I wouldn't last going to stand up. I'd get up there and I would tell one joke that I thought

430
01:29:06,260 --> 01:29:12,119
was going to absolutely slay and it wouldn't. And then it would be over because that was my

431
01:29:12,119 --> 01:29:17,239
best material. I would be like, I'm leading with the best thing I got. And it would be crickets.

432
01:29:17,239 --> 01:29:22,199
And then I go, oh, fuck. Everything I'm about to say after this is not as good as the first

433
01:29:22,199 --> 01:29:57,819
joke I just said. It's over. What do I do? I wish I had dash right now. Shit. I can do it.

434
01:29:57,819 --> 01:30:05,720
Just give me a dash. You got to improve. Sometimes you got to sometimes you got a

435
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:11,369
bomb to improve. Yeah, no, that's true. I think that's accurate. I think like you got to,

436
01:30:12,539 --> 01:30:23,770
you're never going to learn. Nobody starts out perfect. You got to, you got to learn, improve.

437
01:30:24,489 --> 01:30:36,649
I figure out what works and doesn't work. Everybody gets it right the first time.

438
01:30:47,979 --> 01:31:05,500
Allow yourself to grow. What do I always say? What do I always say? Yeah. You're part of the

439
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:34,600
story. I have to get 20 seconds on everything. What do you always say? You always say stones.

440
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:49,819
Yeah. Well, besides that, as other things I say, besides stones, stones, great movie.

441
01:31:50,380 --> 01:32:18,550
Be greedy. I got it. Does it just keep getting harder and harder and harder and harder and

442
01:32:18,550 --> 01:32:33,500
harder until you have to lose? I imagine so. Does each room have a completion survive 120 seconds?

443
01:32:36,789 --> 01:32:48,579
This wants me to fast forward. Oh, I was going to say the, the DVD things never going in the corner.

444
01:32:59,399 --> 01:33:39,609
It did. Oh shit. 120, right? 180. I thought it was 120. I was just lost right there.

445
01:33:44,390 --> 01:34:08,060
Guys keep going. I'm just going to keep going. Wait, one, I was at 93. It's not 120, 60 plus.

446
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:14,310
Oh, I was reading the, whatever. It's two minutes, pal. What's with you guys today and calling me

447
01:34:14,310 --> 01:34:21,109
pal and shit. Like, okay, pal. All right, buddy. Hey, listen, pal. Hey, buddy. What's going on here?

448
01:34:21,829 --> 01:34:36,970
Hey, listen, pal. All right, bud. Hey, buddy. What'd he say? You don't call me your friend.

449
01:34:36,970 --> 01:34:41,130
Don't call me your, don't call me your friend. I'm not your friend. Like, why is that? That's

450
01:34:41,130 --> 01:34:44,569
so funny how they're like that. That's the thing to like really, you know, get into somebody's skin.

451
01:34:46,869 --> 01:34:50,229
You know, you just called me a friend and pal and I'm not, I'm not your friend at all.

452
01:34:50,229 --> 01:34:53,430
You don't even know it. Hey, don't say that. Call me your friend. I'm not a friend of yours.

453
01:34:54,149 --> 01:35:18,939
How dare you call me a friend of yours. Okay, pal. See wise guy to me is, is not the same.

454
01:35:19,659 --> 01:35:25,260
Wise guy is implying that I'm already upset with you. Hey, wise guy. Like, oh yeah. You're,

455
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:43,140
you're a wise guy. This is a baby game. Uh, this room is, is easier, but I wouldn't say that.

456
01:36:02,939 --> 01:36:13,880
All right. I just go until I don't. Do you think it's possible that an alien could be watching

457
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:23,000
your stream? Uh, no, I don't think so. And a network reaching that far into space.

458
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:28,359
I mean, that would imply that the alien has some kind of wifi or why are you implying that there's

459
01:36:28,359 --> 01:36:35,859
an alien here now among us is watching the stream. They're on earth is what you mean. What do you mean

460
01:36:35,859 --> 01:36:53,899
like another planet? Oh, I maxed it out. Three minutes is the max. So this one, this little

461
01:36:53,899 --> 01:37:17,960
disk in here I have to die to. What is it? Not that one. This purple one here. Nope. There we go.

462
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:40,409
All right. Now let's actually get it. You're the first pick for mankind to talk to the aliens.

463
01:37:40,409 --> 01:37:54,390
Uh, what would your first choice of words be? Uh, that's a good question. Okay. Do they understand

464
01:37:54,390 --> 01:38:02,069
me? Is there, is there a part of the movie or is there a part of the, the scenario you're,

465
01:38:02,069 --> 01:38:09,909
you're painting here where the aliens go, hello human. Like they can talk like, oh yeah, we've,

466
01:38:09,909 --> 01:38:14,779
now we know your, uh, your language now. Like they can just like, they sense it in there. Okay. Now

467
01:38:14,779 --> 01:38:19,539
I can speak English. Is that what you're implying? So that we can talk to each other and they can

468
01:38:19,539 --> 01:38:33,260
understand context, what I'm saying. Okay. Uh, first thing I would say is get out, get out while

469
01:38:33,260 --> 01:38:37,340
you still can. This place is fucked. Get out of here. Leave quick. Leave quick. You got to get

470
01:38:37,340 --> 01:38:40,140
out of here now. You got to get out of here now. I don't know what's going to happen. Get out of

471
01:38:40,140 --> 01:38:54,550
here now. Quick. Abandon this place. Abandon it quick. That's probably the first thing I would say.

472
01:38:58,579 --> 01:39:01,300
And then before they left, I'd be like, you got anything weird that you can give me that I can

473
01:39:01,300 --> 01:39:12,630
sell for like a million dollars? And then say, take me with you. Take me with you. Take me with you.

474
01:39:14,199 --> 01:39:19,800
Yeah. And they fly away and I'm like, oh yes, I get to finally go with the alien.

475
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:28,199
And the big beam comes down and I'm looking up. Oh, joyous of me. And they vaporize me.

476
01:39:28,199 --> 01:39:37,369
That's that part of the movie. I don't know why this has to be a movie, but

477
01:39:37,930 --> 01:39:48,060
I guess I just decided it was. How would you try to explain the sus guy meme to an alien who had

478
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:57,130
no prior knowledge of humanity? Hmm. Well, how do you explain humanity to an alien? What kind of

479
01:39:57,130 --> 01:40:03,449
life form is this? They can understand me, but do they understand anything about the planet? Do

480
01:40:03,449 --> 01:40:12,680
they know what water is? But I, we would have to start at zero. Like we drink this and eat stuff

481
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:20,279
or we die. This water here, this liquid in this glass, every single being on this planet

482
01:40:20,279 --> 01:40:27,130
needs to consume a certain amount of this a day or we die. I think that's where you start.

483
01:40:27,130 --> 01:40:34,119
Honestly, that's probably where you start. And then they go, interesting. Now we know exactly

484
01:40:34,119 --> 01:40:42,039
what to obliterate. First, go for the water source. No, no, no, no, no. No, you bastard alien.

485
01:40:43,079 --> 01:41:05,020
How dare you. Take me with you. Take me with you. This room is fucking crazy. What? I need slowdown.

486
01:41:05,659 --> 01:41:23,270
Yeah, we already went over how hot sauce would be an act of war. We already talked about what food

487
01:41:23,270 --> 01:41:28,229
or what beverage you should not give an alien because they're going to see it as like an attack.

488
01:41:29,029 --> 01:41:45,449
How would you explain porn to aliens? I don't know. I don't know. You probably feel like

489
01:41:47,380 --> 01:41:50,500
what would they wouldn't be. I don't know. What kind of life form is this?

490
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:57,859
I don't think they'd even do they know what sex is. Would they? I don't know. What kind of life

491
01:41:57,859 --> 01:42:05,779
form is it? Not again. Not again. Not again. All right. All right. Fine. Fine. Fine. Let's start

492
01:42:05,779 --> 01:42:28,579
with the subway or whatever. Oh my goodness. This was hard. Okay. Explain this to them.

493
01:42:28,579 --> 01:42:34,500
This is great, Dr. Clay. This is fucking hilarious. Okay. This is actually like a 10 out of 10 joke

494
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:38,100
from Dr. Clay. I got it for this. We got to talk about this because yeah.

495
01:42:40,359 --> 01:42:58,550
Okay. Dr. Clay says, how would you explain this to the aliens? Okay. Let's try. Hold on. I got to

496
01:42:58,550 --> 01:43:27,500
save it. Okay. How do we describe this? Save it. It's annoying. I'm just going to try to drag it

497
01:43:27,500 --> 01:43:40,939
from here. Okay. Here we go. Yeah. Excuse me, human. What is this? Well, I mean,

498
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:55,510
I mean, it's a video game where we were shooting and killing. Well, do you find this amusing

499
01:43:55,510 --> 01:44:09,720
to shoot and kill aliens? No, of course not. You see, those are frogs. What is a frog? Oh,

500
01:44:10,439 --> 01:44:15,560
it's a life form here and it's a frog. And that's just like a jokey. We like, oh, look, it's a frog.

501
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:22,100
So you think it's funny? You think frogs are something that you kill? No, no, no, no, no,

502
01:44:22,100 --> 01:44:27,770
we don't. I find that to be fucking disgusting and not amusing at all. In fact, this looks

503
01:44:27,770 --> 01:44:41,500
kind of like Jerry. Jerry's like standing behind him. No, of course it's not. They're crabs.

504
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:44,460
Imagine if space invaders was the thing that got us like alien nuked.

505
01:44:56,659 --> 01:45:13,800
That's like, yeah, that's like incredibly insensitive to the aliens. Right? That is the

506
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:30,060
plot of pixels. What? Oh, they're it's little cartoon characters. They're not real. It's not

507
01:45:30,060 --> 01:45:34,060
it's not a thing. It's they're not what I don't even understand what they're supposed to be

508
01:45:34,060 --> 01:45:39,430
depicting. First, you said it was some type of animal, which was ridiculous to even consider

509
01:45:39,430 --> 01:45:44,859
that concept. Yeah, I'm sorry. Honestly, I'm just trying to make it so you don't fucking shoot me

510
01:45:44,859 --> 01:46:11,130
with that thing you're pointing at me. Take me with you. Take me with you. This is hard.

511
01:46:11,130 --> 01:46:21,960
You got to go quick because the longer this takes. OK, go. Come on. It's right there.

512
01:46:26,010 --> 01:46:56,149
No, coward, coward move. Seriously. Damn it. I did it already. I don't care. I would be in 20

513
01:46:56,149 --> 01:47:02,760
seconds. It can be the one room I don't do. Humanity is going to delete our entire media

514
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:09,060
catalog when the aliens show up. Yeah, there are a lot of media about how aliens we wipe them out.

515
01:47:09,750 --> 01:47:15,189
They show up and we try to get rid of them as fast as possible. They're awful. We like hate

516
01:47:15,189 --> 01:47:22,630
aliens. We hate them. We hate aliens. We paint them in such this crazy light where they show up

517
01:47:22,630 --> 01:47:32,939
and fucking kill all of us and we have to kill them. How would we explain the thousands of

518
01:47:32,939 --> 01:47:42,970
pieces of media about how much aliens are are are terrible and they're here to kill us all?

519
01:47:42,970 --> 01:47:47,050
Or I feel like if you were an alien, you'd show up and you would see some of this shit and be like,

520
01:47:47,050 --> 01:47:53,590
we need to get the fuck out of here, man. This is what they think we're doing. This is what

521
01:47:53,590 --> 01:47:57,109
they think that we need to get out of here as soon as possible. We let's go to the next one.

522
01:47:57,829 --> 01:48:15,449
I don't think I can do this. Let's go up here. Defeat all four different antibodies in a row.

523
01:48:15,449 --> 01:48:32,489
How do I do that? How come you made the aliens stop sounding like nerds?

524
01:48:33,130 --> 01:48:39,420
Because I want to stay alive when they show up. They're going to watch my stream and they're

525
01:48:39,420 --> 01:48:45,859
going to be like, why did he make us sound like that? Why are we standing straight up?

526
01:48:47,989 --> 01:48:52,470
Why is our posture always straight up? And we always have this kind of a voice.

527
01:48:52,550 --> 01:48:57,380
That's not that's nothing what we're like. Why did you do that? You don't understand.

528
01:49:01,899 --> 01:49:11,689
You called them idiots. Take me with you. Take me with you. I promise. I'm a good human.

529
01:49:14,310 --> 01:49:19,829
And I go down, right? I'm like, no, please. I go down on my knees. Take me with you. No,

530
01:49:20,789 --> 01:49:25,029
you don't want any of the other humans. They're awful. They're terribly filthy.

531
01:49:45,300 --> 01:49:52,680
But here's another thing, right? In reality, what do you do with the take me with you guy?

532
01:49:53,239 --> 01:49:59,819
If the aliens leave, right? What do you do with the take me with you guy?

533
01:50:03,460 --> 01:50:13,850
Do I get in trouble? Right? Do I do I get like arrested for that? The aliens show up and I'm

534
01:50:13,850 --> 01:50:19,369
like, take me with you. Leave. Leave with me and all these awful, horrible pieces of shit.

535
01:50:19,369 --> 01:50:24,970
This filthy fucking humans on this planet. Take me with you. And then the ship goes away and it's

536
01:50:24,970 --> 01:50:31,140
like, hey, dude, what the fuck was up with that? And what the hell do we do about that?

537
01:50:33,579 --> 01:50:58,390
You okay? Work stress. Sorry. Somebody said, I say I hate humans all the time. Yeah, that's

538
01:50:58,390 --> 01:51:06,359
yeah. But I think this would be this is more real, right? If the aliens show up and you're

539
01:51:06,359 --> 01:51:18,569
like actively wanting to work with the aliens, does that turn out to be like treason to humanity?

540
01:51:31,659 --> 01:51:43,060
It's not illegal to want to leave Earth. Yeah, I know. All right. Does that change if

541
01:51:44,420 --> 01:51:53,060
all right. But how does that change for you guys? Like, okay, so does it change for you if

542
01:51:54,420 --> 01:52:01,380
the aliens land and the take me with you guy goes and walks over to the other side where the

543
01:52:01,380 --> 01:52:06,060
aliens are turns around and stands with them shoulder to shoulder and is like, huh, does that

544
01:52:06,060 --> 01:52:35,609
change it for you? No. Why would it? Does it? What does he kill other humans? Huh? Yeah. What's the

545
01:52:35,609 --> 01:52:41,130
line though? What's the line for you have joined the aliens and now the aliens left?

546
01:52:43,479 --> 01:52:59,000
Where's the line? Are the aliens killing people? Yeah, let's let's talk about like,

547
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:04,739
like a total takeover alien invasion scenario. And now take me with you guy is there.

548
01:53:17,430 --> 01:53:24,890
Are the aliens evil? All right. Let me beat this level and we'll talk. Are the

549
01:53:25,050 --> 01:53:50,789
aliens hot? Uh, I don't. That's a good question. All right. Let's say they are.

550
01:53:53,779 --> 01:54:01,399
Let's say the aliens. Let's say they let's say they are. How many of you are going to be the

551
01:54:01,399 --> 01:54:12,439
take me with you guy for girl? Huh? Oh, no. Now we got a whole lot of traitors to humanity here now.

552
01:54:12,439 --> 01:54:16,760
Very interesting. Now we got some traitors to humanity all of a sudden because the aliens

553
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:47,939
are hot. Very interesting. All right. I gotta beat this level. Did someone say that the aliens

554
01:54:47,939 --> 01:55:08,899
party? Um, no, not at all. Not in the slightest. Sorry. Childish behavior. What is this party?

555
01:55:10,300 --> 01:55:19,350
Loud sound effects come out of device. Beverages are served that make you stupid. What is this

556
01:55:19,350 --> 01:55:40,149
nonsense? Yeah, but yeah, yeah, yeah. But then that happens. But then one of the aliens during

557
01:55:40,149 --> 01:55:47,909
the course of the time, during the course of the movie or whatever is seen smoking out of a bong.

558
01:55:48,470 --> 01:56:05,939
You know what I'm saying? They got to cut to one of these aliens smoking out of a bong.

559
01:56:05,939 --> 01:56:14,630
And that alien is the one that joins the humans. But what the hell you've got all this alien

560
01:56:14,630 --> 01:56:19,189
technology and you've got, you're so smart and you, you know everything about the aliens,

561
01:56:19,189 --> 01:56:24,789
but you're just smoking a bong as a comedy character. Fuck. We can't get you to help us

562
01:56:24,789 --> 01:56:28,630
at all. Even though you're on our team, you're the comic relief of this whole scenario,

563
01:56:33,319 --> 01:56:38,279
but we have that alien here. That's, that's on our team. Oh, but he's like looking fucking high

564
01:56:38,279 --> 01:56:51,180
over there and he's, he's got like red eyes and he can't help us. Dude. This happens in the movie

565
01:56:51,180 --> 01:57:04,300
Paul. Oh, nice. Okay. What is this movie, Paul? What is the subject matter of this movie?

566
01:57:05,020 --> 01:57:24,439
All right. I got it. I don't know what this defeat all four in a row though that you just

567
01:57:24,439 --> 01:57:38,500
described literally the exact, the whole movie. That's the whole movie. Is this movie 15 minutes?

568
01:57:42,390 --> 01:57:47,579
Please beat the level. Are you even trying? Please dodge the attacks. I just want to see

569
01:57:47,579 --> 01:58:03,979
the gameplay. This person's watching the stream muted. This would be an unbearable muted. Yeah,

570
01:58:03,979 --> 01:58:13,590
that's true. Okay. Defeat. How do I, I got one. Do I just have to pick them up really fast?

571
01:58:18,649 --> 01:58:28,310
One, maybe just really fast. I don't get it. Eat all four different antibodies in a row.

572
01:58:30,869 --> 01:58:35,029
Watch the Paul trailer. I'm curious. I need to know. I don't, I don't, I remember this movie

573
01:58:35,029 --> 01:59:02,010
coming out. Let's watch the Paul trailer. Okay. Hold on. All official trailer. Are we about to

574
01:59:02,010 --> 01:59:08,840
watch everything we just talked about? That's, I'm going to laugh my ass off if that's the case.

575
01:59:08,840 --> 01:59:42,619
Okay. Hold on. Let me get it at HD. It's not even in HD. This is 360p video. All right,

576
01:59:42,619 --> 01:59:56,810
let's give it a watch. I got to mute this. Let's see if it is, it is word for word,

577
01:59:56,810 --> 02:00:31,560
the exact scenario we just said. Okay. Three, two. They do exist.

578
02:00:50,890 --> 02:00:51,529
They don't do that.

579
02:00:56,729 --> 02:01:00,569
I'm closing in. I can feel it in 24 hours. He's going to wish he never set foot on planet Earth.

580
02:01:00,569 --> 02:01:04,409
I want that little green prick dead ASAP. Hi there.

581
02:01:10,970 --> 02:01:15,130
I got my people primed and ready to pick me up. So what happens if you get caught?

582
02:01:15,770 --> 02:01:16,810
I'm going to cut out my brain.

583
02:01:20,010 --> 02:01:24,489
Buzzkill. Let's lighten the mood. Shall we Clive? When did you last get laid?

584
02:01:26,170 --> 02:01:30,170
The individual that you're traveling with is highly dangerous. He's not dangerous. He's kind

585
02:01:30,170 --> 02:01:36,380
of rude. This is small on my planet. A couple of times I've seen him scratch his face and

586
02:01:38,539 --> 02:01:43,100
why was that edited? That was weirdly edited. Sometimes I've seen him scratch his space man

587
02:01:43,100 --> 02:01:48,760
balls. This is small. A couple of times I've seen him scratch his space fan balls.

588
02:01:48,760 --> 02:01:52,279
Why do they edit and splice them together weirdly? She's talking about space man balls.

589
02:01:54,859 --> 02:01:58,380
We look like a family. Hey, we're just a couple of regular guys walking down the street.

590
02:01:58,380 --> 02:02:07,800
Where's the bong? Where's the bong?

591
02:02:09,079 --> 02:02:10,920
This is the most fun I have ever had.

592
02:02:12,920 --> 02:02:14,760
I like this song. Stoke the fire.

593
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:20,699
There's no bong in this movie.

594
02:02:39,210 --> 02:02:42,409
There's no bong in that movie. You did that joke. This is you.

595
02:02:43,130 --> 02:02:51,979
I'm going to watch that. I'm watching that movie like tonight. Bro, this is the trailer.

596
02:02:58,470 --> 02:03:21,000
All right. Let's get going. You've done that bit before. Yeah. Well, come on. It's true. He

597
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:24,539
smokes weed. I'm going to watch the movie. I'll come back to you. I'm going to give you. I'm going

598
02:03:24,939 --> 02:03:30,390
to. I will live. I will give live notes to the movie call and I'll come back to you.

599
02:03:30,390 --> 02:03:47,750
This one doesn't have a. It's kind of loud. There we go. One hour.

600
02:03:49,300 --> 02:04:15,000
Holy shit. That's a long time. An hour. Please live tweet it. I got it.

601
02:04:22,390 --> 02:04:36,010
Dermot, why are you such an anti-noise old lady now? What does that mean?

602
02:04:41,460 --> 02:05:18,060
Ooh, new power. And I actually think I need to die to this. No, wait, what? Just do it.

603
02:05:18,060 --> 02:05:25,989
There's still two things I didn't die to in here. That one's no.

604
02:05:35,460 --> 02:05:38,819
This is a good one. I'm putting this on the stream for a minute. I like this one.

605
02:06:11,399 --> 02:06:16,199
You would have no idea how often this happens, though. I do this almost every single night.

606
02:06:21,819 --> 02:06:30,699
I told you this before. It sucks so bad. If this is a warning to you all, stop, get off of

607
02:06:30,699 --> 02:06:38,220
YouTube shorts, get off of TikTok. And I'm telling you why. Those of you that scroll that shit in

608
02:06:38,220 --> 02:06:46,939
bed, you can relate to this. And I've done it only a few times, but my God, I have fallen asleep

609
02:06:46,939 --> 02:06:54,140
to a YouTube short that just doesn't ever end over and over and over and over. It never stops

610
02:06:54,140 --> 02:07:02,729
in a place for like four hours. It's just like, get it. Can you set a limit to how much something

611
02:07:02,729 --> 02:07:14,439
can play? Is it like, OK, after 50 times, it should stop. Does it just loop forever? And then

612
02:07:14,439 --> 02:07:21,000
I wake up and it's just burnt in my brain, this 25 second clip of just the exact same

613
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:31,420
cadences in the beat and the whole thing. It's just TikTok will tell you to take a break after

614
02:07:31,420 --> 02:07:41,850
an hour. Instagram stops after two hours and your phone is at zero percent. It should be like

615
02:07:43,050 --> 02:07:51,430
10 times or like 100 times. Like that's a lot. What is the original pic?

616
02:07:51,430 --> 02:07:57,369
The original picture is me watching XQC play slots.

617
02:08:11,340 --> 02:08:38,359
You're a mega fan. What is this room? What is this? God, how long did it say?

618
02:08:38,359 --> 02:09:11,220
Give me some stimulation. I am. Oh, I'll try to get 30. Yeah, I fall asleep to something sitting

619
02:09:11,220 --> 02:09:24,600
on my chest every single night. And it just that iPad just sits there and God have mercy on your

620
02:09:24,600 --> 02:09:51,750
soul. If it is a YouTube short for a TikTok. And then do you guys do this too? Where you

621
02:09:51,750 --> 02:10:00,489
you refuse to give it up. You'll wake up with one eye open and painfully put this like decrepit

622
02:10:00,569 --> 02:10:09,289
finger out and slowly push the screen up and then slowly go back to bed.

623
02:10:13,850 --> 02:10:18,729
I almost feel like it's one of those like an old man finger from like the old animated movies

624
02:10:18,729 --> 02:10:26,170
where it's like a bony and bent and like it's like all decrepit and the fingernail is like

625
02:10:26,170 --> 02:10:40,779
five inches long and you know what's going to happen. But for some reason you don't just

626
02:10:40,779 --> 02:10:48,699
turn it off. Just close the just close it. Just get off YouTube. Why? No, I just I want to see.

627
02:10:49,659 --> 02:10:55,260
I want to see what the next food hack is real quick and then I'm going right to bed. I swear.

628
02:10:57,420 --> 02:11:07,699
Oh, oh, that's how they do it. Please repeat 100 times in my sleep and fuck up my dreams

629
02:11:08,869 --> 02:11:27,529
and screw up my brain in the process. Shit. I did it. I did it. I don't need to do it again.

630
02:11:27,529 --> 02:11:35,979
I already got it. What's the criteria for this one? Survive five seconds in all unlocked rooms.

631
02:11:35,979 --> 02:11:54,680
This is how I watch your streams. That's that's fine. That's cool. That doesn't bother me. One's

632
02:11:54,680 --> 02:12:29,720
10 seconds. Are you going to do anything when you're going to play a Miku game? I don't know.

633
02:12:29,720 --> 02:12:41,380
When's the next Miku game coming out? I don't know. What's the first thing you'd show an alien?

634
02:12:41,380 --> 02:13:09,350
Miku Miku concert. All right. There's equal parts of my brain would say the alien would turn to you

635
02:13:09,350 --> 02:13:18,979
and go. I hate this or turn to you and go. Your planet is now saved. We are going to move on.

636
02:13:18,979 --> 02:13:31,189
Carry on with everything you're doing here. It's all up to speed with us. That's a 50 50 coin flip.

637
02:13:31,189 --> 02:13:36,939
That's either a planet gets obliterated or we get new alien technology. I don't know if that's worth

638
02:13:36,939 --> 02:14:06,310
the risk. This one is die with over four disks in the room. OK, there's only two. How do I get more

639
02:14:06,310 --> 02:14:24,899
of these to come out? Sir, die with over four disks in the room. Absorb. What are the zero?

640
02:14:28,220 --> 02:14:43,850
Wait, am I spawning them? That was weird. I kind of OK, I can spawn them, but I don't know.

641
02:14:43,850 --> 02:14:57,479
I don't know. Survive five seconds in all unlocked rooms. OK, so we're not quite there yet.

642
02:14:57,479 --> 02:15:05,430
Defeat or gatekeepers. This will end your current. Whoa, no, no, no, no. Wait, what? Wait a minute.

643
02:15:06,579 --> 02:15:20,279
This is based on runs. So end your current run. Wait, what's going on? Am I out of am I out of

644
02:15:20,279 --> 02:15:36,500
run tokens or something? This will end your run. Oh, OK, I was OK. I get it. For a second,

645
02:15:36,500 --> 02:15:45,689
I thought it was I was ending my game. I was going to start over or something.

646
02:15:45,689 --> 02:15:52,779
He is so stoned right now. No, I'm not. I'm not. I just have massive attention problems.

647
02:16:14,779 --> 02:16:21,500
Dude, you're definitely high. No, I have not. I have not consumed any cannabis products since

648
02:16:21,500 --> 02:16:44,170
the Saw 2 stream. I think on stream, I can do way longer than that. Defeat four gatekeepers.

649
02:16:44,170 --> 02:17:03,340
All right, this one more boss somewhere. Let me try to get to a minute. Oh, that was weird.

650
02:17:03,340 --> 02:17:11,379
I got 20 seconds of art. Defeat all four different antibodies in a row. I don't get that one.

651
02:17:12,100 --> 02:17:25,020
You have to die from everything. Second I see a new song, I'm going to die from it.

652
02:17:37,340 --> 02:17:45,799
Oh, it's right there. Old one. You like about doing weed on stream for that one or not?

653
02:17:45,799 --> 02:17:49,959
You both said you were high during that stream and not. Oh, you must have missed when I when

654
02:17:49,959 --> 02:18:08,090
I told everybody that I lied. Yeah, you're thinking of the Hitman level and Hitman 3.

655
02:18:08,090 --> 02:18:12,729
There was a level that was this big concrete level that I was walking around in circles and

656
02:18:12,729 --> 02:18:16,170
it was it was awful for me. I couldn't figure it out. I was really frustrated.

657
02:18:16,969 --> 02:18:20,250
So everyone was like, dude, you have to be high. And I was like, yeah, yeah, I am.

658
02:18:20,250 --> 02:18:24,969
Yeah, you got me. I just made that up. That did not happen. That was I made it up.

659
02:18:25,690 --> 02:18:56,700
Give me that. I have to I have to get hit by this gold one. Nice. OK, honestly, the last time that I

660
02:18:56,700 --> 02:19:11,739
was truly inebriated on stream, like inebriated, like really inebriated was probably, I don't know,

661
02:19:11,739 --> 02:19:22,709
maybe at some point mid last year, last year, not this year at all. It hasn't happened at all since

662
02:19:28,260 --> 02:19:33,139
Resident Evil 7. No, it definitely was after that, too. That was that was a long time ago.

663
02:19:37,690 --> 02:19:45,770
One of the V.R. streams probably I always drink during the V.R. streams, which is both the best

664
02:19:45,770 --> 02:20:23,719
and worst idea ever. Period cart. Um, I don't I wasn't really I'm talking like drunk. Is it Morrowind?

665
02:20:23,719 --> 02:20:28,120
I don't know. I don't remember. It's been long enough where I really don't remember.

666
02:20:28,680 --> 02:20:38,360
And it is the infamous Minecraft run. Yeah.

667
02:20:51,079 --> 02:21:02,180
No, fuck. I already got 20 seconds. Who cares? What about the Among Us stream?

668
02:21:05,159 --> 02:21:09,909
No, I don't think I I don't think I was doing anything on that.

669
02:21:11,799 --> 02:21:14,760
Did I have a few drinks during the Among Us V.R. stream? I don't think so.

670
02:21:19,370 --> 02:21:27,209
Yeah, I was I was sick. Yeah, I had like I think I think I had covid. Yeah. Or I did I have covid at

671
02:21:27,209 --> 02:21:48,649
that point. That was around that time. Yeah, it was during the covid. Yeah. This one is pretty

672
02:21:48,649 --> 02:21:59,379
difficult. I need to get to 20. Damn it gets so overwhelmed. I might actually do the clones with

673
02:21:59,379 --> 02:22:16,870
this one. You're going to play Among Us again? No, probably not. I don't think so. All right,

674
02:22:16,870 --> 02:22:43,020
there's 10. Damn, this one is hard to get to 20. Am I collecting them too fast? What's the what's

675
02:22:43,020 --> 02:23:05,620
the issue here? You got to be faster. I think you're right. I think it's all about speed.

676
02:23:06,180 --> 02:23:20,680
That would have been sick if I had done it. I don't know if I get this one.

677
02:23:35,459 --> 02:24:00,889
Shit. Maybe I'm going to be slow. You beat Virgil. You can do this. That's true. Yeah,

678
02:24:00,889 --> 02:24:28,459
it's it's definitely slow. Fuck. I only use the slow when I'm at at least 10 to 12 seconds.

679
02:24:28,459 --> 02:25:40,059
Holy shit. This was really hard. Damn it. All right, come on. Let's go. Yes. Got it. Let's go.

680
02:25:40,059 --> 02:25:48,940
Yes. Let's go. There was no enthusiasm on that one. What was the problem with this one?

681
02:25:48,940 --> 02:25:58,200
Oh, yeah. And one of you guys can do this. 20 seconds in the room. That's fish black. No.

682
02:25:58,200 --> 02:26:11,049
Ignoring. Ignoring what? Phantom gatekeeper. Do I die? OK, there's one song here I didn't die to.

683
02:26:11,049 --> 02:26:23,370
Not that one. It doesn't even read chat. No, I mean, maybe like once like once or twice a stream.

684
02:26:23,370 --> 02:26:53,159
I'll look over and be like, I'll read like one or two words. We recorded. It's my birthday.

685
02:26:58,200 --> 02:27:45,780
I mean, it's been yes. Oh, I want to announce this because I know people have been waiting

686
02:27:45,780 --> 02:27:56,389
for this real announcement. Ladies and gentlemen, at some point in the middle of June, Sorcery

687
02:27:57,030 --> 02:28:07,930
will return. We'll do a recap. We can figure out exactly what was going on and where we were.

688
02:28:08,569 --> 02:28:16,090
Sorcery is coming back. I'm actually going to play the third episode. No bullshit. I'm going to play

689
02:28:16,090 --> 02:28:26,469
it. Sit back with a nice hot cup of coffee. Just relax. Play a choose your own adventure game.

690
02:28:34,219 --> 02:29:21,979
Oh, that's sad. Damn it. I need that. Sorcery equals dog shit. I just want to make sure you

691
02:29:21,979 --> 02:29:28,489
understand. You just sided with the aliens in this chat. That's a that's a treasonous statement to

692
02:29:28,489 --> 02:29:36,180
humanity. Now you have to start spamming. Take me with you quick. Take me with you.

693
02:29:48,379 --> 02:30:32,520
There we go. What's this? That guy's brave. Yeah, we're getting close. Die from 45 different disc

694
02:30:32,520 --> 02:30:57,219
types. There's still one in here that I didn't die to. When's the hexes and spells stream? I need

695
02:30:57,219 --> 02:31:13,850
to request work off for that. I still don't understand this one. They die from 45 different

696
02:31:13,850 --> 02:31:39,290
disc types. Does that count as one? There it is. Absorb discs and bring them into the other room.

697
02:31:39,290 --> 02:31:47,540
See, now you are thinking you are thinking. That's that's a lot of thought. Does that actually

698
02:31:47,540 --> 02:31:58,709
work? OK, so now I'm going to die. Or do I have to beat the level? Well, I can't beat the level.

699
02:31:58,709 --> 02:32:14,760
OK, let's die. I just fuck it up. I might have. OK, now kill me. OK, it does work. It do exist.

700
02:32:15,319 --> 02:32:56,739
OK. Wow. Wait, what? There's only three. Hmm. Get a disc that duplicates. That's very smart.

701
02:32:56,739 --> 02:33:02,260
I'll come back. All right. Ten seconds. Survive for 10 seconds. Oh, this is different.

702
02:33:02,260 --> 02:33:14,819
All right. Survive for 10 seconds. Do I have to clear this? I wonder what this means.

703
02:33:15,379 --> 02:33:33,299
I don't think I have to do this. It's kind of cool, though. Yes, I do. It's the only way to make

704
02:33:33,299 --> 02:33:46,969
time go up. I would kick your ass and swindle stones. I'm sorry. Nobody is as full of shit as

705
02:33:46,969 --> 02:34:10,940
me. So I can guarantee you that is one thing that I know I would beat anybody in this room.

706
02:34:10,940 --> 02:34:26,899
It's swindle stones. If I didn't have to be in the same room as other people and not be like

707
02:34:27,860 --> 02:34:37,340
and like turn red and shit like I would be so good at poker. I'd be amazing at poker.

708
02:34:37,899 --> 02:34:46,870
I'm Mr. Albertson. It's time for you to bet. I have to do the thing. I've got like I got pocket

709
02:34:46,870 --> 02:34:53,350
aces. I'd be like. And I start turning purple and shit and people would be like, oh, I know he's

710
02:34:53,350 --> 02:35:05,370
I know what he has. It's so funny. That's one of those things where, oh, hey, don't tell anybody

711
02:35:05,450 --> 02:35:14,680
what you have. You're going to win. I don't have anything. Could you could I. All right.

712
02:35:15,479 --> 02:35:20,569
Could I wear like a ski mask? Would that be like, OK, could I wear like a mask?

713
02:35:25,139 --> 02:35:33,079
No, you can't. So but you're allowed to wear sunglasses at a poker table.

714
02:35:34,120 --> 02:35:39,459
Why couldn't I wear like a why couldn't I put on like a Ronald Reagan mask or something?

715
02:35:40,020 --> 02:35:50,340
Or how big can the sunglasses be? Could I have gigantic, goofy sunglasses that cover

716
02:35:50,340 --> 02:36:03,639
my whole face? You can't hide your face is put as isn't sunglasses hiding your face.

717
02:36:04,360 --> 02:36:22,329
Give me a new power. This is not good here with an alien mask.

718
02:36:23,059 --> 02:36:26,340
No, I'm talking about like a private poker tournament, like a poker tournament or something

719
02:36:29,430 --> 02:36:45,719
where a full fursuit. Damn it. This one's kind of hard. Slow would be best for this one.

720
02:36:49,030 --> 02:36:57,799
There's no time. So let's do it slow or those in a timer. They might be.

721
02:37:11,510 --> 02:38:04,040
Fuck slow. It's definitely slow for sure. Oh, if I was in like a private poker tournament

722
02:38:04,040 --> 02:38:08,889
and I had like a voice changer and a ski mask on stuff, people would still know what I had.

723
02:38:08,889 --> 02:38:12,809
The only difference is instead of it being you could see, you could still see my expressions

724
02:38:12,809 --> 02:38:34,409
and stuff instead of being like, oh, it would be like, oh, oh, last. I still didn't do this one.

725
02:38:34,409 --> 02:39:01,379
20. Does it cost to do that? It doesn't. That's a big deal. I'm trying to use it too often.

726
02:39:12,809 --> 02:39:20,600
No, give me slow. Wait, maybe carve the middle out first so I don't have to go as far.

727
02:39:20,600 --> 02:39:43,379
But no, go on the edge first. Damn it. I can. It's really this one's not even that hard. It's just

728
02:39:43,379 --> 02:39:48,389
they're doing the same pattern as the spiders and Isaac. And you know that I can't handle those.

729
02:39:49,110 --> 02:40:12,120
It's that erratic like pause, go pause, go pause, go pause, go damn it. I had it.

730
02:40:12,120 --> 02:40:24,139
Come on. I got it. I got it. Not even three out yet. Here we go. I think you imbecile.

731
02:40:24,139 --> 02:40:47,739
That one was stuck up there in the top and I just fuck. That's another villain word.

732
02:40:48,819 --> 02:41:05,239
Imbecile, imbecile, imbecile, imbecile. This is one of those that I have to get 20 seconds

733
02:41:05,239 --> 02:41:25,450
or I refuse to move on because I'm so close. I know I'll get it. No, I thought it was going

734
02:41:25,450 --> 02:42:00,620
to go the other way. OK, go. Yeah. OK, thank goodness. 10 seconds in this one.

735
02:42:00,620 --> 02:42:26,090
You should play Google Snake. Snake infuriates me. What was that snake game? It's an EO.

736
02:42:26,090 --> 02:42:31,209
It's an EO game. I played it for a little while and I was obsessed with it.

737
02:42:32,200 --> 02:42:39,940
Yes, slither, slither, slither. Yep, slitherio. I was obsessed with it and it was I hated it at

738
02:42:39,940 --> 02:42:47,059
the same time. You would get huge and then somebody would just do that thing. Some little

739
02:42:47,059 --> 02:42:54,579
new spawn Andy would just fly in front of you and drive next to you, next to you, next to you,

740
02:42:54,579 --> 02:43:06,059
cut in front of you. This has ruined everything. And you know, you're sitting there thinking like,

741
02:43:06,059 --> 02:43:11,299
all right, buddy, you got to work your way up. You're coming to the big leagues right now.

742
02:43:12,100 --> 02:43:17,530
Get out of here. What do you think you're doing? Right? Like that's a what? That's a who do you

743
02:43:17,530 --> 02:43:24,860
think you are scenario? Who do you think you are? My name's up on the leaderboard. Yours isn't. You

744
02:43:24,860 --> 02:43:36,409
just spawned. Get out of here. What do you think you are? Who do you think you are? I am. That's a

745
02:43:36,409 --> 02:43:53,479
great video. All right, I'll take 29. Still two discs. I had to get hit by survive five seconds

746
02:43:53,479 --> 02:44:12,309
in all unlocked rooms. What was this one? I think I could probably get it. This is going to be like

747
02:44:12,309 --> 02:44:18,840
annoying to look at though. So it's going to be kind of hard in the eyes. Just be aware of that.

748
02:44:19,479 --> 02:44:48,680
It's already over. Damn it. What was this one? Survive 10 seconds in all unlocked rooms. Survive

749
02:44:48,680 --> 02:45:01,340
90 seconds total in this zone. Play Breath of the Wild. I stubbed my toe last night and it

750
02:45:01,340 --> 02:45:17,450
really hurts. I don't think I can. I don't think I can perform that well. Play tears of the kingdom

751
02:45:17,450 --> 02:45:24,940
then instead. I would. I just, I said I have an appointment I have to get to. It's an important

752
02:45:24,940 --> 02:45:32,219
one so I have to get to it. When did you say you wanted me to stop by? When did you want me to do

753
02:45:32,219 --> 02:45:45,559
that? When? What time? What time did you want me to? What time is it? Like 7 30 is when you want to be?

754
02:45:46,600 --> 02:45:54,469
That's that's fucking crazy. My appointment is at 7 45 but I'm not gonna do man. Sorry.

755
02:45:56,299 --> 02:46:01,979
Wow. Shit luck. What? I was thinking about doing it. I was thinking about playing it at 7 45. I

756
02:46:01,979 --> 02:46:17,059
have to. I have an appointment I have to get to. That's what's weird. That's crazy. He's done this

757
02:46:17,059 --> 02:46:27,270
bit before you can tell. I'm sure I have. I don't know. I mean unironically I do. There is a lot of

758
02:46:27,270 --> 02:46:35,780
work to do this week. Okay. Like on a completely unironically. There's a lot going on this week.

759
02:46:35,780 --> 02:46:40,420
So I mean that's hey I can't play. I cannot play Breath of the Wild or tears of the kingdom.

760
02:46:41,219 --> 02:46:58,219
A lot going on. Okay. I want to absorb one of these because does that does that count as

761
02:46:58,219 --> 02:47:15,479
four? You got time for disc world. This game is called disc room. Just say you don't like it and

762
02:47:15,479 --> 02:47:24,889
move on. I do. I'm just fucking around. Guys I cannot start tears of the kingdom which is like a

763
02:47:24,889 --> 02:47:46,340
6 000 hour game before I beat the first 1500 hour game and beat it already. Yeah but I just don't

764
02:47:46,340 --> 02:48:03,750
want to right now. I got a lot to do still. You don't start the first Hobbit movie then skip to

765
02:48:03,750 --> 02:48:28,780
the next one. I actually feel like you kind of do. No you don't. I'm making a dumb joke. Absorb it.

766
02:48:28,780 --> 02:48:44,680
All right. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. So this is going to count as four discs right.

767
02:48:44,680 --> 02:49:03,079
It's going to spam a bunch. There it is. Thank you. Thank you. Wait what? I would. Can I just do it?

768
02:49:03,079 --> 02:49:26,729
How come that didn't count? It just said I had it. I just said I did it. That's weird. With a gold

769
02:49:26,729 --> 02:49:52,260
one. Okay. I just picked up a gold one. What is it? Will that? Can I bring that somewhere? Die with

770
02:49:52,260 --> 02:50:11,299
four discs in the room. I guess I'll just do this one. When I unlock everything I'll probably have

771
02:50:11,299 --> 02:50:25,879
a clear picture of what to do. I wonder if there's a final boss. How did you find this game? Um uh

772
02:50:25,879 --> 02:51:15,049
there's a game path. What's wrong with that? Game pass. What's wrong with that? Oh I almost had it.

773
02:51:15,049 --> 02:51:47,000
I mean it's a month and you get access to games and game pass is actually good. Yeah yes it is.

774
02:51:47,000 --> 02:52:07,719
Um at that person say that you're fucking awesome. You know what I mean? Are the elder

775
02:52:07,719 --> 02:52:22,819
wilds dlc? Oh I I really liked outer wilds. I was really confused by it though. I heard the dlc was

776
02:52:22,819 --> 02:52:30,579
more confusing. I got it. There we go. Oh shit we're almost to the last few rooms.

777
02:52:30,579 --> 02:52:50,790
All right this is out of 25. What is this? Well I need to die from that. It is but a guide is acceptable.

778
02:52:50,790 --> 02:52:56,600
Okay. I mean as long as if I could use a guide and people wouldn't be like wow dude

779
02:52:57,239 --> 02:53:23,100
you stink. I mean you guys would say that anyways but shit. These need to spread out. I'm gonna get

780
02:53:23,100 --> 02:54:13,479
killed. This dude smells like a game pass. Damn it. Come on stop. I can do this. 25. You stupid.

781
02:54:13,479 --> 02:54:18,860
You hate sorcery? I just gave you a date. I said when I was playing sorcery. I gave you a hard date.

782
02:54:18,860 --> 02:54:45,020
June something. Oh my goodness. All right come on. Stop. It's it's not even hard because they

783
02:54:45,020 --> 02:55:21,500
change cores. I need to do it. It's objective. It has to be done. Oh my god. They just track you.

784
02:55:21,500 --> 02:55:33,989
Can you finish tf2? Do you know I got this massive craving for a man versus machine because I saw

785
02:55:33,989 --> 02:55:39,420
that overwatch was just like oh no we're not really doing that anymore. I was like oh well

786
02:55:48,139 --> 02:55:52,780
it's funny that was the one thing that I really actually wanted to play in overwatch

787
02:55:52,780 --> 02:55:57,819
if in overwatch 2. I was like oh okay that's the only reason why I would play overwatch 2.

788
02:55:57,819 --> 02:56:03,959
That was my sole reason to play it because like I don't I mean I had fun with overwatch

789
02:56:04,979 --> 02:56:08,920
but then I was saying when they said oh we're doing a pve thing I'm thinking you're talking

790
02:56:08,920 --> 02:56:12,280
about man versus machine is that what you're talking about is that what you mean by that

791
02:56:12,280 --> 02:56:19,989
because if that's what you mean by that you've got I'm signed up now so hearing that it was

792
02:56:19,989 --> 02:56:35,719
kind of not really what they're doing anymore was well now I but I want to do that oh oh it's

801
02:59:37,100 --> 02:59:51,219

802
02:59:51,219 --> 03:00:41,530
cool oh shit we're good there it is that's fine the ultimate gatekeeper is right here

803
03:00:41,530 --> 03:01:00,549
this is not a tile one all right we're gonna find where these are this one's gonna be weird

804
03:01:00,549 --> 03:01:12,700
isn't it no same one same pattern I think it's the same pattern okay well let's go get a raid

805
03:01:12,700 --> 03:01:23,940
from chibli thanks chibli welcome everybody currently playing I was about to say attack of

806
03:01:23,940 --> 03:01:30,629

808
03:01:48,389 --> 03:01:59,049

809
03:01:59,049 --> 03:02:09,540
a difficulty and that's why actually it's kind of horrible I think any dash for this that thing

810
03:02:09,540 --> 03:02:41,190
just expands or blast would be good too oh my god I don't think I can get close enough to do that

811
03:02:43,100 --> 03:03:10,459
now I'll go back to dash I dash through it find out I cannot he'll complete breath of the wild in

848
03:15:31,379 --> 03:15:41,959
I don't know I can't tell I didn't lose I guess it's still fine maybe not it's hard to tell

849
03:15:41,959 --> 03:16:15,610

865
03:20:35,129 --> 03:20:41,299
purple yeah I don't even know if the purple character can live maybe that might be a part

866
03:20:41,299 --> 03:20:57,350
of a really really hard challenge each room the purple character has to stay alive all right one

867
03:20:57,350 --> 03:21:07,059
more try and I'm moving on this is too addicting this is the kind of stuff that I would have played

868
03:21:09,110 --> 03:21:26,579
just in my bedroom all night I would not have stopped an old flash game oh I'm in trouble

869
03:21:27,139 --> 03:21:53,100
this would have ruined my sleep in high school yeah damn it honestly the corners are the biggest

870
03:21:53,100 --> 03:22:27,379
problem that was pixels that was pixels mate pixels duh that sucked I thought I touched it

871
03:22:41,819 --> 03:22:56,420
no what about uh n plus I actually didn't play that much n plus I played a lot of meat boy

872
03:22:56,420 --> 03:23:04,950
and what was that there's a couple of the really big ones the ones where you had to shoot

873
03:23:04,950 --> 03:23:10,149
people out of cannons and go further and further and further and upgrade upgrade upgrade upgrade

874
03:23:10,149 --> 03:23:18,889
upgrade stuff like uh burrito um what was it get learned to fly was one toss the turtle

875
03:23:18,889 --> 03:23:29,719
what's the one I'm thinking of though burrito bison that's the one toss the turtle I would love

876
03:23:31,610 --> 03:23:39,129
a those dominated for a long time then they kind of went away forever I missed those games

877
03:23:42,389 --> 03:23:53,340
I wish somebody would make a new version of one of those I feel like those would do really really

878
03:23:53,340 --> 03:24:05,530
well now can you imagine that with a bunch of content and a ton more to do there's been a

879
03:24:05,530 --> 03:24:12,489
couple of remakes right and kind of re-releases of those but not a brand new one and if it exists

880
03:24:12,489 --> 03:24:29,420
please tell me so I can obsess over it damn it burrito bison's on the app store yeah I've beaten

881
03:24:29,420 --> 03:24:33,420
it already though that came out a while ago that came out a long time ago on the app store

882
03:24:39,530 --> 03:25:03,690
toss the turtle remake what about tank artillery game I remember artillery dude you know what man

883
03:25:03,690 --> 03:25:10,870
why don't we just play some of those one of these days I would just sit there and play burrito bison

884
03:25:10,870 --> 03:25:20,389
or learn to fly or toss the turtle all day just sit here and just hang out and play it let's put

885
03:25:20,389 --> 03:25:51,239
that on the list that sounds fun I have to get this uh you should do it right now uh I I can't

886
03:25:51,239 --> 03:26:03,270
I actually can't what about I want to be the guy yeah let's revive the kind of old flash uh nights

887
03:26:03,270 --> 03:26:15,030
that I used to do here DOS nights flash nights they were fun I can't leave until I get the 20

888
03:26:15,030 --> 03:26:32,780
seconds I can't leave flash is dead but I believe there are certain things that you can still play

889
03:26:32,780 --> 03:26:40,459
them with I did a absolutely minuscule amount of research but I think there is a way to do it still

890
03:26:44,389 --> 03:27:00,469
uh yes flashpoint I need to look into it a little bit more there's a couple other old games that I

891
03:27:00,469 --> 03:27:10,219
really want to try to track down again I'm trying to remember what the context of this particular

892
03:27:10,219 --> 03:27:45,610
game was let me see if I can figure it out no one adult swim unicorn game that's right

893
03:27:45,610 --> 03:27:57,459
it was one where you had to like bounce stuff you had to like throw it a certain distance or

894
03:27:57,459 --> 03:28:04,709
something and it was insanely insanely frame perfect detailed I forget what it was called

895
03:28:05,670 --> 03:28:23,850
no not angry birds no not not angry birds I almost just beat it and I wasn't even looking

896
03:28:23,850 --> 03:28:52,739
monkey kickball was that it shit backyard baseball I don't think it was backyard baseball

897
03:28:56,569 --> 03:29:03,340
I saw it wasn't a wasn't will neff playing that for a while you see he's like he's the

898
03:29:03,340 --> 03:29:35,559
goat of that game right this is the one right here guaranteed oh I thought I had it that was

899
03:29:35,559 --> 03:30:13,829
doing so good I gotta get them out of the corner that's death you piece of shit I have to get

900
03:30:13,829 --> 03:30:34,659
through that oh I can't leave we're gonna miss my appointment stir said hey man where are you our

901
03:30:34,659 --> 03:30:50,200
appointment was a bit ago yeah but I my uh my stomach hurts I don't feel good I don't feel good

902
03:30:50,200 --> 03:31:11,659
I can't I can't go take me with you why did you write that I don't there's no context for you to

903
03:31:11,659 --> 03:31:34,780
write that take me with you yeah stir thinks he can beat this game let's see him do dark world

904
03:31:34,780 --> 03:32:08,629
like me and I'm doing right now give me the dash have you been in this level for like 15 hours

905
03:32:08,629 --> 03:32:19,350
yeah I'm I got to 19.2 seconds it was 19.2 no I think it's it's definitely slow

906
03:32:20,069 --> 03:32:43,049
what is it maybe absorb why is this one what is the right place why is that gold it is not that

907
03:32:43,049 --> 03:33:18,809
power at all it's slow this is the one right here I'll get it right now that didn't even touch me

908
03:33:18,809 --> 03:34:34,170
come on no yes short stream Andy yeah I know I know I'm just streaming you can stop now I

909
03:34:34,170 --> 03:34:53,139
yeah I know I mean I'm already I'm already late to this appointment so hard mode is 10 seconds to

910
03:34:53,139 --> 03:35:02,870
clear uh yeah I know I just trying to get the 20 20 is the real completion of the level it might

911
03:35:02,870 --> 03:35:16,229
even be higher on some of them how am I even going to touch the squares in the middle I've just made

912
03:35:16,229 --> 03:35:46,090
it down here oh oh dear oh dear oh there's no getting out of that that's true get him right at

913
03:35:46,090 --> 03:36:08,260
the beginning that's right what I do just stay out of the corners and I'll be all right oh he's

914
03:36:08,260 --> 03:36:42,520
got to move how he's got to move I was close oh my goodness that was so perfect too it just they

915
03:36:42,520 --> 03:37:09,190
he just spammed it at me keep getting purple guy killed the purple guy hey I'm not in control of

916
03:37:09,190 --> 03:37:33,579
the purple I already blew it I didn't go in the middle first get the ones in the middle and I'm

917
03:37:33,579 --> 03:38:19,750
fine no I can't stop playing this dude that void whatever it is pushed it over you saw that that

918
03:38:19,750 --> 03:38:41,940
was annoying sticking with this formula you should be able to get them all needs to go backwards

919
03:38:41,940 --> 03:38:54,700
they're gonna shoot it oh come on why am I doing that I'm getting worried about you I'm fine don't

920
03:38:54,700 --> 03:39:12,250
worry about me hey don't worry about me I didn't go in the middle well these ones are definitely a

921
03:39:12,250 --> 03:39:29,909
lot more precision based it's a great play gonna work out though I can't move oh I was pushed up

922
03:39:29,909 --> 03:39:44,200
to the edge of the thing yeah I couldn't move you can't walk into this you can't dash through

923
03:39:44,200 --> 03:40:14,389
it either oh I thought I had it somebody should make a compilation just um and have it have to

924
03:40:14,389 --> 03:40:22,069
be no time in the middle of every time that I've gone oh just string them all together I wonder

925
03:40:22,069 --> 03:40:37,540
what it sounds like be like I sound like a banjo kazooie character probably get out of the

926
03:40:37,540 --> 03:40:55,190
fucking way oh my god I can't touch it I how am I supposed to touch that there were two that

927
03:40:55,190 --> 03:41:10,780
were spawned by then it almost took up the whole entire map all right 10 more tries and I'm done

928
03:41:10,780 --> 03:41:16,950
this one doesn't count it only counts if I clear the middle first okay this now is a real attempt

929
03:41:18,280 --> 03:41:30,309
10 more real attempts I don't count that one either oh none of these counted I have to make

930
03:41:30,309 --> 03:41:41,780
one full revolution around here and get to phase two all right this is a real attempt now oh sloppy

931
03:41:42,420 --> 03:41:59,879
that one doesn't come that is so annoying why is that that keeps killing me and I just shouldn't

932
03:41:59,879 --> 03:42:37,719
I'm getting just too a hair too close that doesn't count either I've done two I'm in trouble

933
03:42:37,719 --> 03:43:00,010
I should play Hearthstone instead no it happened again I just I what I don't those things never

934
03:43:00,010 --> 03:43:22,389
killed me until I gave myself a amount of times I can do this still I I can never touch the ones

935
03:43:22,389 --> 03:43:39,690
in the middle from here I gotta get the ones in the middle right now yeah they have to get

936
03:43:39,690 --> 03:43:58,420
him first otherwise it just becomes I don't think becomes possible oh you piece of shit

937
03:43:59,059 --> 03:44:30,229
that didn't even touch me all right five more that's it no that doesn't count either I'm getting

938
03:44:30,229 --> 03:44:43,180
sloppy you never told us about the skunk dream oh that's right I I mean I told it in um what

939
03:44:43,180 --> 03:44:53,819
pre-stream or the discord or something I had a dream that I mean the extent of the whole dream

940
03:44:53,819 --> 03:44:58,700
it really is not that intriguing it's not wild it's not something that is going to make you go wow

941
03:44:58,700 --> 03:45:09,700
what a crazy dream I had a dream that they were what I thought were cats in the room like oh yeah

942
03:45:09,700 --> 03:45:15,780
like there's just cats in here and they were just kind of walking around and hanging out

943
03:45:16,600 --> 03:45:24,649
like oh yeah of course there's here's here are the cats and it turned out though that they were

944
03:45:24,649 --> 03:45:33,110
skunks and I looked down and realized that they were skunks and was like pet I had been petting

945
03:45:33,110 --> 03:45:40,389
these like oh hey like hi like kitty it was a skunk but they were cats in my brain and they

946
03:45:40,389 --> 03:45:45,190
were really friendly they wasn't like weird it was just yeah I just hanging out with some skunks

947
03:45:45,909 --> 03:45:56,520
that's the whole dream there was a baby skunk from what I remember and I'm a petting the baby

948
03:45:56,520 --> 03:46:01,879
skunk's head and is doing that thing it was closing its eyes and leaning its head up

949
03:46:02,600 --> 03:46:09,719
did you know just barely holding its head up like oh yeah I like that that's it and then I woke up

950
03:46:10,360 --> 03:46:18,489
what does that mean I have not seen a skunk I have not talked about a skunk I've not heard

951
03:46:18,489 --> 03:46:24,059
anything about a skunk why did I have a dream that I was hanging out with skunks and we were cool

952
03:46:24,620 --> 03:46:34,219
it was like oh yeah this is cool they're with friends it means you smell all right 10 more

953
03:46:41,670 --> 03:46:49,750
I have to pull I gotta pull a plug right now yeah I gotta I have to pull the plug

954
03:46:50,309 --> 03:47:03,510
I have to I will I'll never leave yeah this is the end I'm uninstalling the game damn it it didn't

955
03:47:03,510 --> 03:47:30,659
work I can't wait for the toss the turtle stream that's gonna be fun that was it right there I just

956
03:47:30,659 --> 03:47:51,049
got pushed up when they spam all in one direction at me I can't even it's over just like you

957
03:47:51,049 --> 03:47:59,799
uninstalled breath of the wild you got me why have I not gone back to breath of the wild when

958
03:47:59,799 --> 03:48:25,500
I said I would well because I needed to make room oh my god that was it too it's never I'm

959
03:48:25,500 --> 03:48:38,979
never gonna be able to do this yeah I needed to make room from monster hunter rise and I thought

960
03:48:38,979 --> 03:48:44,709
I was gonna free up some space by just deleting this fucking game and I really wanted to play

961
03:48:44,709 --> 03:48:53,479
monster hunter rise and I just I accidentally uninstalled it and now my games are gone all my

962
03:48:53,479 --> 03:49:01,479
save files are out of here and I was really unhappy about it I was really pissed off about it

963
03:49:02,200 --> 03:49:20,729
and then I smashed my wii over my knee I had to switch dude what yeah I went into I went into the

964
03:49:21,290 --> 03:49:26,409
into my closet I got the wii out and I smashed the wii instead of the switch for some reason

965
03:49:26,409 --> 03:49:48,200
apparently people heard that is weenie yeah I got yeah dude I gotta get pissed off I was

966
03:49:48,200 --> 03:49:55,479
fucking furious nice I smashed my weenie uh I smashed my weenie really hard I was pissed

967
03:50:05,079 --> 03:50:11,819
all right I'm done I'm done after this I have 10 minutes to do this that would be four hours on

968
03:50:11,819 --> 03:50:46,010
stream that's it I have 10 minutes to get this done you can't do it it's pushes you people got

969
03:50:46,010 --> 03:50:51,479
timed out earlier for saying penis flattening stream yeah but that was completely out of context

970
03:50:53,180 --> 03:51:03,719
context where's the context you got context if you can't if you just say hey when is the penis

971
03:51:03,719 --> 03:51:10,040
flattening stream you're gonna you're gonna get timed out but if I had if we had just talked about

972
03:51:10,040 --> 03:51:23,500
how I dropped a book on my penis then okay now you there's context for you to just discuss you

973
03:51:23,500 --> 03:51:58,680
just where's the context it's important I never told I didn't tell you guys this but it's it's

974
03:51:58,680 --> 03:52:06,069
funny enough to tell you no no enough time has passed remember when I went on break I went on

975
03:52:06,069 --> 03:52:14,379
that break where I was like okay I'm gonna be gone for a few weeks the first day of that break

976
03:52:15,020 --> 03:52:27,700
first day okay let's go over it very quickly I um it's like all right it's time I'm on my break

977
03:52:28,420 --> 03:52:35,479
I'm gonna I'm gonna just relax for a little bit and and look it's just so you know sometimes I

978
03:52:35,479 --> 03:52:40,200
just want to it's time to relax right it doesn't happen all the time doesn't happen every day

979
03:52:40,840 --> 03:52:47,399
but I want to relax and I'm I'm gonna you know 21 and older in a state where it is legalized

980
03:52:48,120 --> 03:52:59,540
I um I put took in some marijuana product okay there you go so a little while goes by and it's

981
03:52:59,540 --> 03:53:04,500
fine and it's this is everything's good just hanging out it's like all right this is cool

982
03:53:04,500 --> 03:53:09,940
start of this break I feel like I kind of needed it a lot of stuff is going on um stuff that you

983
03:53:09,940 --> 03:53:14,659
guys don't really know that you probably will very soon but it's very exciting but things we'll talk

984
03:53:14,659 --> 03:53:17,379
about and one of those things obviously was rambo's show because that's a huge deal and

985
03:53:17,379 --> 03:53:31,579
it's really cool but I digress I shit my pants I shit my pants and I went up to take care of this

986
03:53:35,909 --> 03:53:47,159
and in the process of taking care of this I clogged the toilet so I shit my pants

987
03:53:47,879 --> 03:53:54,200
went to the bathroom I can take care of this this has not happened in a very long time a very long

988
03:53:54,200 --> 03:54:04,569
time so I clogged the toilet and I realized there's no plunger I don't have one the one that I did

989
03:54:04,569 --> 03:54:08,250
have I wanted to replace because it's like you know every so often you get rid of a plunger

990
03:54:08,809 --> 03:54:12,409
you get rid of it because like it's kind of at some point right you need to replace it

991
03:54:13,959 --> 03:54:22,260
so I couldn't go anywhere right like I'm I'm I'm I'm what am I gonna do so I'm a little bit

992
03:54:22,819 --> 03:54:25,780
you know I'm a little inebriated I'm obviously not gonna not gonna get in a car

993
03:54:26,420 --> 03:54:34,409
so I contemplated I was like I think I have to I think I have to call italics and see if he'll go

994
03:54:34,409 --> 03:54:50,100
buy me a plunger and deliver it to the house it didn't get that far because thank thank god

995
03:54:51,000 --> 03:55:13,430
thank god it ended up just it went down and I was like oh thank god yeah and imagine that

996
03:55:13,430 --> 03:55:21,350
conversation that I would have had to have hey man um yeah I uh I shit my pants and then I clogged

997
03:55:21,350 --> 03:55:26,149
the toilet and I I'm not I'm not gonna drive anywhere but of course it's not happening

998
03:55:27,209 --> 03:55:35,450
can you you know maybe we'll give you a plunger and come and deliver it and I'll pay you I was

999
03:55:35,450 --> 03:55:48,790
gonna I was gonna pay you know I was gonna pay whatever it took why are you self-reporting all

1000
03:55:48,790 --> 03:55:58,940
this I don't know I think it's kind of funny don't make a moment out of this why that's just a stupid

1001
03:55:58,940 --> 03:56:13,180
story my embarrassing it's so funny because I ended up you know just kind of I think Holly

1002
03:56:13,180 --> 03:56:17,180
knew something was going on because like obviously you don't want to tell anybody like oh hey by the

1003
03:56:17,180 --> 03:56:25,979
way hey honey I shit my pants and clogged the toilet um I have I don't think I've seen her laugh

1004
03:56:25,979 --> 03:56:37,450
as hard as I did because no no it's both things happened both things happened in the same like

1005
03:56:37,450 --> 03:56:47,270
20 minute period so it's a come on come on you can't do that to me I'll take one of those things

1006
03:56:47,270 --> 03:57:12,180
as enough of an annoyance but both of them happening that's not okay that sucks oh that

1007
03:57:12,180 --> 03:57:23,379
was it how long you been on this level for I I haven't really been paying attention how long did

1008
03:57:23,379 --> 03:57:35,559
you how long did you clog the toilet if it because I didn't guys listen I it's not like I dropped an

1009
03:57:35,959 --> 03:57:41,180
you do you do you any idea what I'm referring to when I say this I think a lot of you might think

1010
03:57:41,180 --> 03:57:45,579
that there's like a cartoon dump in my pants when does that that's not how this plays out

1011
03:57:46,299 --> 03:58:06,219
that's not how that happens it's not like what stop talking I need to explain so people get

1012
03:58:06,219 --> 03:58:14,899
the real picture why was this topic brought up I've been sitting on this topic for like

1013
03:58:14,899 --> 03:58:22,700
four and a half weeks because I thought it was really funny afterwards like first day vacation

1014
03:58:22,700 --> 03:58:35,690
all this they all this happens in a row we don't want you to visualize it you don't have to just

1015
03:58:36,250 --> 03:58:56,299
listen to the sounds listen to my the sounds my voice talking all right this is the one right

1016
03:58:56,299 --> 03:59:14,889
here watch bro this is impossible did you flush your pants no I didn't flush my pants down what

1017
03:59:14,889 --> 03:59:37,700
are you talking about you guys are really overestimating like how how you're thinking

1018
03:59:37,780 --> 03:59:52,090
too deeply into the first part the first part is a oops it's not a whoa oh what the holy shit

1019
03:59:53,129 --> 04:00:03,430
whoa it's I can't even move no it's a oops it's a oops you guys are seriously putting way too much

1020
04:00:03,430 --> 04:00:26,489
into that first part yeah Holly just said you were being really quiet it's just silent why

1021
04:00:26,489 --> 04:00:30,329
yeah and that's abnormal because I'm usually just doing like Thanos impressions walking around the

1022
04:00:30,329 --> 04:00:51,739
house that's abnormal already okay you know when you kind of haven't seen your dog in like a few

1023
04:00:51,739 --> 04:01:03,819
minutes and it's like wait a minute where's the dog what's going on it's like what this I think

1024
04:01:03,819 --> 04:01:40,440
the dog's getting is a dog dog's getting into trouble I think the same with kids yeah stop

1025
04:01:40,440 --> 04:02:16,809
camping the middle you're camping the middle I would have had it oh shit it's been 10 minutes

1026
04:02:16,809 --> 04:02:40,569
come on move it's not fair oh no that's how you know he stopped it I am inevitable shits his pants

1027
04:02:40,569 --> 04:02:53,979
and is quiet now like wait a minute where's the next part of that usually after that you hear

1028
04:02:53,979 --> 04:03:02,680
slow footsteps in there I know what it's like to lose know so deeply that you're right it failed

1029
04:03:02,680 --> 04:03:32,899
a little that follow-up did not happen so where is he all right that's it I'm done I'm done I'm

1030
04:03:32,899 --> 04:03:40,790
done it's too addicting and I've it's challenging and hard and it's fun it's a fun game and I I want

1031
04:03:40,790 --> 04:03:49,719
to beat this level so bad but it's so tricky I'm done I'm done and I'm gonna install it that's it

1032
04:03:49,719 --> 04:03:52,600
all right goodbye that's enough I'll see you later that's enough that's the end of this one

1033
04:03:53,239 --> 04:04:15,770
I'm a new strategy new strategy let's see if it works all right I actually have a new strategy

1034
04:04:15,770 --> 04:04:21,799
let's go I'm leaving the bottom right corner and I'm gonna pull him to the bottom right corner

1035
04:04:26,520 --> 04:04:30,280
actually right now go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go I got it I think I got it

1036
04:04:33,819 --> 04:05:15,860
you can't move you actually can't move there's no escape the dash no you can't dash doesn't go

1037
04:05:15,860 --> 04:05:26,520
through the uh the void or whatever it is what are you doing all right this is the actually the

1038
04:05:26,520 --> 04:05:54,149
last one what the fuck are you I'm done what are you supposed to do I'm done that's it that was

1039
04:05:54,149 --> 04:05:59,530
cool and take a look at how much other hard shit there is to do in this game there's also

1040
04:05:59,530 --> 04:06:15,319
secrets and stuff that's fun I like it I like it a lot oh also I think um the 4k non crusty version

1041
04:06:15,319 --> 04:06:20,069
of the grotto beast commercial I know people have been asking for it looking for it it's

1042
04:06:20,069 --> 04:06:28,069
going to be going up on the grotto beast channel I think in the next little bit tonight you want

1043
04:06:28,069 --> 04:06:48,040
to see it without the crust you have to end on a win no that's a that's a fallacy that's a fallacy

1044
04:06:48,040 --> 04:06:53,909
but I'll see you later uh let's actually raid someone it's been a while I feel like

1063
04:11:03,399 --> 04:11:12,299
that's right I forgot about the music uh okay let me put the music on that's right I don't I

1064
04:11:12,299 --> 04:11:19,860
didn't put the music on what was I thinking ladies and gentlemen welcome to episode one

1065
04:11:20,420 --> 04:11:29,379
of food for thought the podcast where I talk about food and food stuffs sometimes maybe even

1066
04:11:29,379 --> 04:11:34,420
talk about other things that have nothing to do with food but we'll see how it goes on the first

1067
04:11:34,420 --> 04:11:42,469
episode so I don't really have a plan with this I just knew that it was something I wanted to do

1068
04:11:42,469 --> 04:11:50,870
eventually and something I've been thinking about but I think I'll first before we get into anything

1069
04:11:51,829 --> 04:11:57,190
I'll probably should probably list my favorite foods why would you be listening to a food

1070
04:11:57,190 --> 04:12:03,299
podcast before the person tells you what their favorite foods are I mean I I wouldn't listen

1071
04:12:03,299 --> 04:12:11,860
to it either my number one favorite food well I should probably start from my least most favorite

1072
04:12:11,860 --> 04:12:21,979
is that how it would probably go my least most favorite food is grilled chicken it's very versatile

1073
04:12:22,059 --> 04:12:31,750
to be used in a lot of different ways a lot of different casseroles and sandwiches you can put

1074
04:12:31,750 --> 04:12:39,450
it on a plate with some rice and and it'd be great it's just a very versatile piece of equipment

1075
04:12:40,090 --> 04:12:48,090
to use in the kitchen I eat grilled chicken probably every few days it's very easy to keep

1076
04:12:48,090 --> 04:12:56,549
in the fridge it's very easy to keep in the freezer but besides that I think my number nine

1077
04:12:56,549 --> 04:13:03,370
least most favorite food would probably have to be spaghetti spaghetti again also very versatile

1078
04:13:05,209 --> 04:13:18,340
you can put beans sometimes I would put beans on it excuse me oil red sauce white sauce doesn't

1079
04:13:18,340 --> 04:13:24,760
matter pasta is incredibly especially pasta spaghetti meatballs how many meatball fans do

1080
04:13:24,760 --> 04:13:32,809
I have out here I'm sure I have quite a few but I think that my favorite food would probably be

1081
04:13:32,809 --> 04:13:40,149
meatballs number one again how many times have you been at this grocery store you think yourself

1082
04:13:41,260 --> 04:13:47,530
what the heck am I even going to have for dinner tonight and I I don't know I had the answer to

1083
04:13:47,530 --> 04:13:53,370
that question is I don't know but it would usually be meatballs for me if not grilled chicken and

1084
04:13:53,370 --> 04:14:05,079
some bell peppers and asparagus um I think I I think that's probably it for this episode

1085
04:14:05,799 --> 04:14:11,940
I'll check back in with you all um on the next one which is probably going to be this Sunday

1086
04:14:12,819 --> 04:14:21,559
is sunday or saturday I I don't really have anything else to say I just those are my favorite

1087
04:14:21,559 --> 04:14:31,350
top 10 favorite foods and I just um yeah I I this is uh we'll we'll come back next week and

1088
04:14:31,350 --> 04:14:37,190
we'll talk about uh we'll talk about my favorite restaurants there's quite a few so we'll go through

1089
04:14:37,190 --> 04:14:41,350
those too because you really need to know this stuff before we get into anything really important

1090
04:14:41,350 --> 04:14:50,629
but that's it that's episode one this has been uh food for thought with me Jeremy Elbertson

1091
04:14:51,930 --> 04:15:06,229
78 years old today it is 2060 and that's how old I am today well it's not my birthday but I

1092
04:15:06,229 --> 04:15:17,510
