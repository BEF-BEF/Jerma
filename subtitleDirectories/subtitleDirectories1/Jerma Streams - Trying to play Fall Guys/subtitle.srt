1
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:08,859
Little early, huh? Do you guys think it's funny that the last, probably two or three streams,

2
00:00:08,859 --> 00:00:15,320
I've said? Yeah, it's gonna be starting around noon. Oh, just kidding. It's starting at 9 30 a.m. Pacific

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:24,550
time. How do you think that's funny? You know what I mean? It's click baiting. Am I? What did I do?

4
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:37,990
The title is, finishing in the top 10 is a win for me. That's just a fact. That's just me telling you

5
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:48,259
what's gonna happen. Finishing in 11th place is second place. Finishing in 12th place is

6
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:53,079
third place. Make sure you remember that for this stream because that's going to happen quite a few

7
00:00:53,079 --> 00:01:01,880
times. You're a loser. That's not a loser. That's winning in your own world. That's called winning

8
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:13,109
in your own world. He's settling. All right, whatever you want. Whatever you want to call it.

9
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:28,390
I'm winning in my own world. That's a loser talk. No, it's not. As long as I make my rules.

10
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:36,760
Look, if I come in 13th or 14th place, sure, I lost. I didn't win. I come in 12th place. That's

11
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:57,430
third place. All right, you ready? What about 40th? How many people are in this game? How many people?

12
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:05,129
How many players are there? 60? All right, is this game any good? Be real with me. I've seen a lot of

13
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:09,530
people have been playing it. I've seen a ton of people playing it. I feel like people like it.

14
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:22,939
It's pretty average. Well, here let's let's go ahead and take a look. Does this mean that I'm the

15
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:29,659
does this mean I'm the 8300 and second fall guy? Does that mean that I'm the 8300 person to install

16
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:41,750
the game? How does that work? Or do I have to get that higher and be that's my ranking? This is a

17
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:48,219
tuber game? Well, whatever. I'm an ex tuber. I think I'm allowed to be a tuber sometimes.

18
00:02:48,780 --> 00:03:01,860
I thought you were going to play this with stir. It's a little early for stir though. I think he

19
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:07,449
has something to do today, but I wanted to play it. Look, don't you guys know with all tuber games,

20
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:12,889
you've got to strike while the iron's hot. Otherwise, don't do it. If I don't play this

21
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:18,900
game now, you think I'm going to play it in like six months? No, I got I've got to jump on. I've

22
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:24,360
got to get on the ride. Let me get on the ride. I don't care that I'm sitting all the way in the

23
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,659
back of the roller coaster. I mean, that sucks. I want to be up in the front, but I wasn't there.

24
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:33,659
So I have to take my seat all at the last spot of the roller coaster, but I'm not going to be

25
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:42,759
able to see the big drop. Whatever. Okay. So if I press A right now, you guys are all going to

26
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:50,699
press A at the same time, right? That's how this works, right? Like you wait for me to press A and

27
00:03:50,699 --> 00:04:01,159
then everybody presses A. Okay, here we go. I'm going to press A now. Oh, some of you got

28
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:07,500
fucked up there. I'm going to press A right now. Sorry, some of you got messed up. Do a countdown.

29
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:20,339
Sure. Wait, hold on. This outfits. I like the blue, uh, common kind of like the sprinkles.

30
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:26,310
Well, I like, I know lightning bolt face. I'm not putting that on people that this is the gibbous

31
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:35,370
of this game. I'm not going to wear it. People will know I'm new. I'm putting on the bird feet

32
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:51,060
though. That's important. Okay, cool. Yeah, let's go. Theatrics. Oh, this is a D pad. Oh, I don't

33
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:59,959
have anything celebrations. All right. What does this mean? Season one ways to buy stuff. Oh,

34
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:10,550
this is a buy things game. Oh, it's a buy things game. Is it? No, it's not. Right? Yeah. Oh, it's

35
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:15,620
pretty generous. All right. Cool. All right. I'm just gonna, I don't have no idea what the fuck's

36
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,779
going on. I only know there's like a hundred people don't lose. I guess. I don't know anything about

37
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:29,660
this game. You ready? Three, two, one, better press it. Ah, it's too bad. You were coming for me.

38
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:37,879
How about now? Oh, wait, it just does this anyways. It's not like Hearthstone where you press the

39
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:44,149
button and it locks you into somebody. Am I going to get like stream sniped? This is what this game

40
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:53,620
is, right? It's just stream sniper of the game. Cancel it. I can cancel it. Just keep canceling

41
00:05:53,620 --> 00:06:04,899
and keep looking for players until I like get rid of all of you. How many people are playing

42
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:11,720
this right now? Enough. Did I miss everything? Did I miss the boat? Oh no. Did I miss the boat?

43
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:32,660
I got, you got rid of us. Somebody gave 50 bucks. I have to say thank you. Thank you. Weak

44
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:39,160
cankles for the $50. It's a huge amount of fucking money. Thank you. Am I going to, is something

45
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:46,180
wrong with my computer? It happens a lot of this connection errors, but the servers are under

46
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:58,019
maintenance. Are they done? This is not like, Oh, are they? Do I have to do something else?

47
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:13,319
Did I restart the game? Oh no. The servers are down. What? Oh fuck. No, they're not. Let me see.

48
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:24,579
Wait, ball guys, Twitter. I waited like seven days to play this. Fuck. Don't play on day one. It's

49
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:27,540
going to be overloaded. Don't play on day two. Everyone's going to be really trying to play

50
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,819
because like all the streamers and YouTubers all played at the same time and everyone's playing

51
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:33,939
at the same time. And then like a week later, German nine, eight, five gets on the back of

52
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:41,560
the roller coaster and still fucked up. Is that, let me see. Is that for real? All guys, Twitter.

53
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:49,639
I don't see anything here. There's no scheduled maintenance. I'm just playing it again. I'm going

54
00:07:49,639 --> 00:08:02,360
to try it again. I'm playing TF2. Oh yeah. If it doesn't work this time, I'll restart it.

55
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:20,250
Put the gibbous on. No, I'm not putting the gibbous on. The servers are actually down. Oh

56
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:39,690
damn it. How are they really? No. All right. I'm going to, I'm going to reset the game.

57
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:55,909
Hold on. Let's reset the game. Oh, that stinks. Did you just do a comb stream? Oh, I need to put

58
00:08:55,909 --> 00:09:04,259
on clothes if I do that. Hold on. Let's try this again. Heroes of Might and Magic three. No,

59
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:16,570
I'm not prepared for that one right now. All guys. Well, I mean, I have a shit load of things

60
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:22,090
installed. We could just, we could pivot. I mean, we could pivot pretty quickly here to the complex,

61
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:26,970
which is an FMV choose your own adventure movie game made by the same people that made,

62
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:32,460
uh, Silent Night, whatever it's called. What the fuck is that game? The one where you drive the

63
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:36,539
car. The one where you, what's it called? It's not Silent Night. What is it called?

64
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:50,059
I got it. It's called like tonight. What was it called? Let's try this. Night shift. There it is.

65
00:09:50,059 --> 00:10:03,700
Yeah. Made by the same people. Read this before you start. Yeah. It's made the same for the made

66
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:19,720
late shift made a new one. It's called the complex. I don't think this is going to work.

67
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:25,860
Keep trying. It takes like five tries to get in. How popular is this game? What is this the most

68
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,460
popular game ever? Is this the, this has got to be the most popular game on steam right now. It

69
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:49,929
has to be, right? Two million sold on steam. Oh my God. In like five days, you got to be shitting

70
00:10:49,929 --> 00:11:09,690
me. 125,000 players right now at 10 AM. Holy shit. Well, turn off your VPN. You think that's

71
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:24,870
causing a problem? It shouldn't cause a problem. Yes. Yes. Yes. A hundred percent. No, no, that's

72
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:36,460
not a problem. No, that's not an issue. That's lying. The servers are crashed. All right. Well,

73
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:42,059
I don't want to just sit here and just stare at a guy falling for three hours. You guys do that

74
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:55,320
already. I don't want to sit here and do it with you. Uh, unable to find a match. What? All right.

75
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:03,779
I'm going to, we're going to give this a few minutes. Saw waiting room. No, no. Saw waiting

76
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:12,940
room. Oh, read Yelp reviews. I don't know. I'm not going to go for Yelp reviews. No, I'll go. Go

77
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:19,419
read Yelp reviews on stream. It's just, Hey guys, all the Yelp, all the places and restaurants that

78
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:23,580
I go to are going to drop by two stars because they're on stream. I'm not doing, I don't want

79
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:36,700
to do that. Don't fall one more time. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Turn the boot it back

80
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:44,870
up. Turn it back on. Get a server back on. We can, we can do this. We can, we, one of my, we can do

81
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:49,429
this. Who's the we in this scenario? I have nothing to do with this and neither do any of you.

82
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:54,490
This is somebody at an office or at a warehouse that has to like fix this. It'd be probably

83
00:12:54,490 --> 00:13:00,149
freaking out right now. This has nothing to do with me. Oh, we can do this guys. What do you mean

84
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:08,230
we? No, you can't. Warehouse. Yeah. This is where they get, what do you think? They store all the

85
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:28,070
computers. They store a bunch of computers in a fucking cold ice room. Yes. All right. I'm going

86
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:32,470
to pivot. We got to pivot. Damn it. I wanted, I wanted to fucking play this dude. Shit. All right.

87
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:38,779
We're going to pivot to the complex. I feel like that's, I want to play it. It's a choose your own

88
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:48,139
movie game. You know, we love those. Come back in an hour. We'll see how long I think this, I think

89
00:13:48,139 --> 00:13:55,100
the complex is like an hour. So we're good. Right? Let's go. I'll come back and try it. And wait,

90
00:13:55,100 --> 00:14:04,379
wait, wait, wait, wait. What happened? Did I play? I'll come back in an hour. We're going to do the

91
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:15,139
complex and I'm going to come back. Dammit. Complex is a 90 hour game. That's, it's a 90 minute game.

92
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:23,299
I think you read the second word wrong. I got to change my title. Shit. What am I? It takes me like

93
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:32,470
two hours to come up with a title for a stream. How about like movies? Um, choose. I don't know.

94
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:49,509
The servers are back. Don't do that to me. Servers are back. No, they're not. Are there people

95
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:55,350
fucking around? Are they actually back? Can somebody please tell me that they're back?

96
00:14:55,350 --> 00:15:00,200
And I don't want like three of you to say this. Servers are back. They're back. They're actually

97
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,360
back online. Actually online. It's better not be a debate. I'm going to be really mad if it is.

98
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:22,360
It's a lot of you are saying it. I mean, I opened the game. I was, is this real? I'm in a game right

99
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,840
now. They're not back. Multiple one guys actually back. Am I, I'm just getting, why did I even open

100
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:32,809
the fuck up? Why did I even open this? Why did I open this again? Why? What's the point? What's

101
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:41,990
the point of this? This is a lie. Do a political stream. That's the last thing I'm going to do ever.

102
00:15:42,789 --> 00:16:02,059
No, were you lying to me or what? I'm not going to do this again. I'm not going to do this. No. All

103
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:06,700
right. Okay. It was, it was a bunch of bullshit. Fine. I'm not listening to you guys ever again,

104
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:13,830
but I don't care if I'm like standing somewhere and there was a car behind me, like literally

105
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:21,299
like, and the guy behind the wheel is leaning forward with this wicked fucking angry face.

106
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,620
And he's, and he's coming for me and I'm just sitting there talking to you guys and you're

107
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,059
going to be like turn around. There's a guy with the fucking guts, right? I'm not even going to

108
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:39,379
fucking listen to you. I've never listened to you guys ever again. I mean wicked. What? All right.

109
00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:44,299
We're going to do. Okay. How was I, this is just a movie. I don't even know what this movie game is

110
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:50,009
about. We're going to play it. How about just, I'm naming this string complex. Who cares? Nobody

111
00:16:50,009 --> 00:17:01,960
cares about the title. It doesn't matter. I do. Hey, the servers are back online.

112
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:12,329
They could be. Let's see how this is. Let's see if this game is any good. When did this come out?

113
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:37,299
Turn off your fucking VPN. Servers are up. Maybe I don't want to play this. Well, I, I wasn't ready

114
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:43,670
for this one. Ironically too. All right. I'm turning. All right. No, no, no, I'm moving on.

115
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:53,769
Let's go. Turn off your VPN. All right. It's no, it's not real. It's, it's not real. You're fucking me

116
00:17:53,769 --> 00:18:02,329
up. No, they're not. All right. I'm, I'm opening this game. Turn off your VPN. Don't turn it off.

117
00:18:02,329 --> 00:18:10,950
Don't fall for it. I don't want to play the complex. What do I play instead? I don't want

118
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:24,059
to do this right now. To open up AI dungeon. Actually, that's not a bad idea. It's not a

119
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:30,869
terrible idea. Either that or Nancy Drew. I'm ready to, I'm ready to go full on fucking just

120
00:18:30,869 --> 00:18:51,420
Nancy Drew. Let me see. Is AI dungeon in the same spot that it was before? Or do I have to do that

121
00:18:51,420 --> 00:19:10,630
thing again? Boy, I said the word Nancy Drew. God damn it. Didn't I? Let me just do this.

122
00:19:11,269 --> 00:19:17,829
So the AI dungeon, AI dungeon.io, is that a better version than the other one before? You remember

123
00:19:17,829 --> 00:19:23,000
how it was kind of not as good as the other one? That like kind of Google doc one, whatever it was.

124
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:39,210
So it's, it's good now. Let me just put this on. Oh, is German 95 emotionally today? Good or bad?

125
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:42,970
Well, it started good. And then I couldn't play the game that I wanted to play. And it just threw a

126
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:47,369
wrench into my, it just threw a wrench into my window. And so now I have to figure out what I'm

127
00:19:47,369 --> 00:19:56,920
going to do. And that's how it happens. End of the stream voice. No, I should have been more

128
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:07,430
prepared to have a backup. All right. Let me get this going. Can I capture this? You'd have like

129
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:26,920
