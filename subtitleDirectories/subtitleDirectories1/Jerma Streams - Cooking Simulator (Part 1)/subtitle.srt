1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:10,169
So I'm thinking about a new intro screen that starts to play a loud like fallout boy song,

2
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:15,990
and it gets progressively louder and louder, starting at like 60 seconds until it is unbearably

3
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,160
loud. And every time like another number counts down on the screen starts at 60. Once we get to

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:27,719
like 15, the numbers start to fucking get huge. And like a big bass just explosion happens on

5
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:33,780
every countdown. It's like 15, boom, boom, and fallout boy gets louder and louder and louder

6
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,789
until it gets to zero. And then I come in, I'm like, Hey, everybody, welcome to the stream.

7
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:48,100
You guys like that? Should I put that one in a box and never open it again? I was thinking

8
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:54,729
about it sounds like pretty good, right? And there's like this fucking crumbs all over my chest

9
00:00:54,729 --> 00:01:03,640
and like all of my mouth. I don't know why that would be there, but it is. I get that

10
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:10,219
one in the box. Hey, how you doing guys? You know, okay, I'm gonna give you guys a

11
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:16,790
tutorial on how to do the YouTuber and streamer yell. So you start normally like this,

12
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:21,670
right? And then almost almost pretend like you're yelling into a wall or like you've

13
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:26,760
ever yelled into a pillow. You pretend like the inside of your mouth is a pillow

14
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:33,980
that you're yelling into. So instead of being like, welcome to the stream. That's a fucking

15
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:40,019
yell. I just yelled. It's welcome to the stream. You almost like you use your teeth

16
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:57,030
as like a pretend muffler. So I used to do it. I think I got how do you think I made

17
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,930
fucking 50 trillion views on YouTube by doing the yell into the fucking teeth and

18
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:29,189
YouTube yell. Do you even know how to cook? This is cooking simulator. Just taking a sip

19
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:32,710
of my coffee hanging out here while I just made a tweet. I'm pretty much ready to go.

20
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:41,430
Came out today. Yes, it actually did release today. We don't have to pretend like I'm

21
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,949
going to stream this yesterday like I thought I was going to. It is now out. It's installed.

22
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:47,509
I actually have it up on the screen right now, but I'm not going to show you yet.

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:06,150
Show it. Not yet. It's not ready. It's not time. Not Hearthstone. That was still fun,

24
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:19,129
though. I had a good time. Well, here I'll have this ready. We already got right off the bat.

25
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:21,530
I've been waiting for this game for a long time. We've got some great music.

26
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:34,020
This is such unbelievably perfect in between announcements at the wedding music.

27
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:44,340
I'll give you an example. So for instance, okay, ladies and gentlemen, that that was it

28
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,219
for the first dance and your server will be coming around with the first course of dinner.

29
00:03:49,219 --> 00:04:02,889
Enjoy it. We'll see you soon for the son and mother dance. It's every single one.

30
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:14,360
And for some weird reason, this stays on the whole time. Even when you're eating. I don't know why

31
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,870
they do that. Put on some like fucking Beethoven or something. That'd be more appropriate, right?

32
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:31,800
Anyway, we've wasted enough time. So I'm going to spend a little bit of time on this one guys

33
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:40,180
because I've been waiting for this for fucking ever. Cooking Simulator is the game that I've

34
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:49,180
been waiting for. This is my most anticipated game of 2019. No, it's not fucking Anthem 2

35
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:54,920
or whatever the hell is coming out. It's not like it's not destiny. Put a line through the two

36
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:07,449
and put it back on steam. No, it's this. So what should I do? Cooking School? Let me turn it up

37
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:18,379
a little bit. It's a little it's a little soft. There we go. Let's do cooking school.

38
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:27,579
Seasoning using if you have no idea what this game is. It's a cooking simulator. That's it.

39
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:39,319
There's nothing else. No shit. Wow. Okay, now it's really loud. Today's lesson is short,

40
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:42,680
but the skill you learn with it will determine whether you get tips or have to wrestle the

41
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,240
guests for money. Let's learn the basics how to season food. We need to wrestle the guests

42
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,660
for money. They're gonna steal? Target the salt container. Notice the number under the label.

43
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:59,430
Shows how much spice is left in the container. It's 500 gold in here. Okay,

44
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:04,970
now sprinkle the salmon and use the container to enter sprinkle mode.

45
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:15,339
All right, so this is sprinkle mode. Now for the actual seasoning. Aim for the fillet and use the

46
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:25,740
container until you season the fish with three grams of salt. Three. That was easy, wasn't it?

47
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,019
It gets a lot harder when the product is cut into pieces. Better practice your aim then.

48
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:46,459
What? That's that's not that's that's not too much salt. All right, so let's make a dish.

49
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:52,149
I am so fucking excited. You have no idea. Why is everything blue?

50
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,839
Think it's time you've served your first dish. Don't worry, I'll be here to guide you through

51
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:01,319
the whole process. This isn't a test, but if you run into trouble performing any task,

52
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,959
try one of the earlier lessons. All right, like seasoning the fish.

53
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:10,970
Steak with a side of french fries. Simple yet nuanced. There's no actual guest waiting,

54
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:18,980
so you can take your time. Simple yet nuanced. Look behind you. That's the checkout window.

55
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:23,819
Once we're done, you'll need to place the order on the shelf and use the tablet to

56
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:30,500
confirm. Simple yet nuanced. I don't think there's anything nuanced about getting a frozen

57
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:35,800
food section bag of french fries and a steak. I don't think that's very nuanced.

58
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,360
Look, someone ordered a dish. Every time a client orders something, you'll be notified

59
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,240
in the upper left corner of the screen. Notifications will also appear when you have

60
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,759
only a minute left to complete a dish. You're slightly late or when a client gives up waiting

61
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:58,600
and goes home. Imagine it takes that long for someone to make you food that you go home.

62
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,560
That's it. That's your order. Walk up to the display and press on the

63
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:11,370
steak with french fries. Take a good look at the screen. To the left,

64
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:15,529
you've got a list of ingredients. And to the right, what do you have to do with them?

65
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:19,290
Don't worry, we'll do it step by step. First, take the steak out of the refrigerator.

66
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:25,720
Imagine you order like steak and french fries from a place that like two hours go by.

67
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:32,779
You just leave. Why would you wait that long? I have a very strict policy on if the food is

68
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:43,019
not out in fucking 30 minutes or less, goodbye. If fucking Pizza Hut 20 years ago can come up with

69
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:48,580
that idea. 30 minutes or it's free. You can't make a fucking steak in 30 to 40 minutes.

70
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:56,899
I don't think so. Pizza Hut fucking made that a reality. All right, let's get a steak.

71
00:08:57,379 --> 00:09:02,179
What we only have two. What does C mean? Is this the quality of the meat?

72
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:08,730
Try not to go bankrupt. Almost everything in the kitchen costs money. Plates, products,

73
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:13,529
and especially repairs. Don't take more than you need and keep an eye on your balance.

74
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:16,809
Once you're out of money, you're out of business. What is C?

75
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:25,000
Take, okay, take the steak out of the fridge. What is C? Does it sense?

76
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:33,179
All right, put down on the cutting board. Now pick up a salt and use it on the steak. 4G.

77
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:38,899
Hey, why don't I, never mind. All right, gotta get this right.

78
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:47,269
Pretty good. Now let's have some black pepper. Again, we'll need four grams on the steak. Okay,

79
00:09:47,269 --> 00:10:00,730
so black pepper. All right, put this down. Pepper, four grams. Still on the save spot.

80
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:07,659
Okay, I did it. Time to heat things up. Turn on the griddle. It's right next to the fridge.

81
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:15,820
All right, put that down. Here's the griddle. Okay, turn it on. Put the steak on the

82
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:21,659
griddle. Target the steak to view its state. That green bar indicates that the food is cooked.

83
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:29,190
The little pan icon informs you that it's been fried. Look up. There's a spatula hanging above

84
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:40,629
the griddle. Take it. Precise handling of cooking the spatula. Ow, my hand.

85
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:45,110
Precise handling of tools in the kitchen is crucial. Holding down shift will open up new

86
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:50,519
ways. All right, I don't think I can take the fucking interlude wedding music. It's the same

87
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:54,840
loop. Holding down shift will open up new ways to manipulate whatever you are currently holding

88
00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:00,649
in your hand. Oh, shift is like a context menu. We want to fry both sides of the steak so we need

89
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:04,250
to flip it. Target the steak. Use the spatula. Once the steak is on the spatula, target the

90
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:21,320
griddle and enter context. Hold the key to flip. All right, hold on. The steak is done.

91
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,480
It's done. Go and find some plate and paint that should be one on the storage shelf.

92
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:39,830
Do I take this off? Is it cooked? Shit. All right, I got it. We need a plate. Okay,

93
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:53,080
plate. Just put this down for a second. Move, move, move. I'm moving. How do I put this down?

94
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:10,259
Okay, back we go. Target the steak and plate it. Okay, put it down.

95
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:30,120
Put it down. Put down. Put container down. I just want to put it down. All right, pick up product.

96
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,980
Why can I pick it up? I need the spatula to pick this up. Where's the spatula?

97
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:58,870
I think I broke the tutorial. Target the steak and use the plate. Wait, I'm too tall.

98
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,460
All right, turn the fucking oven off. All right, now what? Oh, you want to put it

99
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:23,610
over here. Now take the cutting board. All right, I got the cutting board. Go to the pantry and buy

100
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:31,669
two potatoes. Potato one. Potato two. All right, now take them back to the countertop. We'll need

101
00:13:31,669 --> 00:13:39,639
to cut them. I feel like I'm like my body is fucking so far away. Do I have the FOV too high?

102
00:13:40,440 --> 00:14:00,490
Okay, here we go. You want me to just cut them? Okay, cut. Holy shit, this is unbelievable.

103
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:19,529
We don't want me. What? How many pieces? 10? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. How do I? Hold on,

104
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:33,429
rotate that around. 9, 10. Walk up to the deep fryer. Press the button to. All right,

105
00:14:33,429 --> 00:14:37,669
the tutorial is kind of just like launch up at the top of the screen. Turn on the deep fryer.

106
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:47,210
What did that even just say? Okay, to the left is a fryer basket.

107
00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:52,649
Pick up all the potato pieces. Put them into the basket and just target them and use the basket.

108
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:21,419
What? Why are they going through? Am I insane? Why did that fall? Okay, expand pickup range.

109
00:15:27,049 --> 00:15:33,580
Expand pickup range. Oh, okay. I don't want this other whole potato though.

110
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:42,490
Target deep fryer. Place the basket inside. Now let's wait for the fries to cook. They're

111
00:15:42,490 --> 00:16:10,250
supposed to be french fries. Oh, get the plate with steak. Are these done? How do I do it?

112
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:18,580
Rotate. This is so funny. I love this. Okay, you guess would be long gone by now.

113
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:27,860
Yeah, well, I'm just, I gotta learn the tools. Now to finish the dish, go to the herb

114
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:35,320
shelves in the pantry and add two rosemary twigs. This looks fucking terrible. I have two

115
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:44,629
gigantic potato pieces. It's supposed to be fries. Whatever. All right, what do you want? Two twigs?

116
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:54,970
Done. I was, I don't know why I was making potato chips. All right, here we go.

117
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:55,779
Order up. Take a photo of your dish. I can fix this. Context, guys. All right, click.

118
00:17:55,779 --> 00:18:05,059
Look at how good that looks. Save that one. All right, order up. Steak with fries. You need

119
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:13,769
to place the dish on the checkout counter left of the exit. Yeah, okay. Look at that. They didn't

120
00:18:13,769 --> 00:18:20,759
even know that half of that shit touched the ground. How many fame points were given for

121
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:24,680
this dish? The better the restaurant, the higher the quality of dishes you need to prepare to

122
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:30,420
earn any fame. Poorly made meals will lower your fame rating. Taste, determined by the

123
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:35,779
technical and thermal quality of the dish. I cooked it to perfection almost. Cooking points,

124
00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:39,539
how many points do you need to learn new dishes? The better you cook, the quicker

125
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:46,180
you can unlock new recipes. Nine cooking points. Some paid for the dish by the client. 45 cents.

126
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:53,849
Tip, a sign that the client liked the dish. Any complaints? Guest complaints. French fries

127
00:18:53,849 --> 00:18:58,250
where there weren't enough salt on the french fries and there were some heating mistakes.

128
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:03,750
The temperature was perfect, but how does it make any sense? You want five-star quality food.

129
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:09,299
Go to fucking Burger King. How does it feel? Ready to take on the challenge of the kitchen

130
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:13,220
in your own? If not, you can always come back for a lesson or two. Cool. Okay. So I think I'm

131
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:27,480
understanding it. Advanced buying. All right, there's only a couple more. Buying items through

132
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:34,099
the shop UI. I've shown you previously how to buy products from shelves. However, not everything

133
00:19:34,099 --> 00:19:40,220
can be found just lying around. This guy looks mean. Today you'll learn how to buy everything

134
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:49,240
you'll need and more. See that cardboard box? I need you to walk up to it. Now target box,

135
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:54,200
okay. That's a shop. This is the shop. Ooh, look at this. Look at all this fresh ingredients.

136
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,039
This is the shop screen. Items split into four categories and by default have sorted alphabetically.

137
00:20:01,589 --> 00:20:05,990
Spices and liquids can only be bought here and they come only in larger amounts. So be prepared

138
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:09,990
to pay a handsome fee. If you have trouble keeping track of your tools and pots, you can

139
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:16,619
buy additional ones from the utensils tab. Be aware that quality doesn't come cheap. Now go

140
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:21,349
to the liquids tab. Avocado oil. The tabs at the bottom of the menu determine the sorting

141
00:20:21,349 --> 00:20:28,099
order. I want you to select the right most sorting tab. Okay. Product should not be sorted

142
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:33,539
according to their price. Descending. If you haven't noticed, prices are denoted to the far

143
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:39,380
right in green or red if you don't have sufficient funds. I want you to get avocado

144
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:47,049
oil from this list. Buy it. Bottle of avocado oil. Leave the shop view. You can buy only

145
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:52,470
one item at a time. No tricks with a container this time. Okay. Don't forget this lesson. Many

146
00:20:52,470 --> 00:21:02,339
items can only be bought this way. I was gonna drink it. All right, now what I want

147
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:08,259
you to do is I want you to chug the avocado oil. And when you do it, look right into the camera.

148
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:24,819
And I want you to say it. Never mind. Last one. Today I'll give you a quick tour of the kitchen.

149
00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:28,579
Stay focused. You need to memorize all of this. Great. We can't have you wandering about

150
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:33,289
searching stuff while the guests are waiting. I'm gonna fucking ruin everything. Go to the

151
00:21:33,289 --> 00:21:38,200
marker. Here you find mostly vegetables, some fruit, bread, and buns. Some of the products

152
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,640
you will need to unlock by learning new recipes. Look at that fucking pantry. That's

153
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,140
an envious pantry. Remember that you'll need to pay for the products and be sure to bring a

154
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:52,700
container if you want to carry more than one piece. Here you will find plate stacks. And

155
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,859
again, you have to pay for every single one. Once the dish is served, the price of the plate

156
00:21:56,859 --> 00:22:01,420
will be added back to your account. Fucking expenses. You can also use plates to carry

157
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:06,809
things around the kitchen, but be careful these things break easy. Even more important

158
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:10,569
are the cardboard boxes. Trouble finding something, you can buy one from a box.

159
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:15,990
These shelves are used for storing herbs. Just as with everything else,

160
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:19,589
the herbs have to be purchased. You pay for every twig or leaf you take.

161
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:25,539
Go to the next marker. Okay. Let me, let me, I need to get reading comprehension here.

162
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:33,380
Fruits and vegetables are here. I can grab them. They cost money. Oils, seasonings,

163
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:40,569
spices, all right here. Herbs, right here. Plates. If I can't find like a fucking

164
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:45,210
tomato in here, if I can't see the tomato, then I go here and I can just, it's a big list.

165
00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:53,609
Okay. In case there's a fire, break out the fire. This is the refrigerator. Here you can buy

166
00:22:53,609 --> 00:22:56,490
fish, meat, cheese and fruits. Some of the products are hidden in the drawers at the

167
00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:00,410
bottom of the fridge. Okay. So all the meats and cheeses and stuff are in the fridge.

168
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,579
The griddle is used for searing and frying. As long as the recipe doesn't call for any

169
00:23:06,579 --> 00:23:11,700
fat such as oil, most meat needs to be fried on both sides. So don't forget to flip it.

170
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:18,329
The stove is your best friend here. You can boil, fry, grill with the right pan, of course.

171
00:23:18,329 --> 00:23:23,619
Under the stove, there's even a backup oven. Remember that pots and pans come in different

172
00:23:23,619 --> 00:23:27,380
shapes and sizes just because there are six burners doesn't mean you'll fit six containers

173
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:34,970
on the stove at the same time. This is really, really detailed. There's so much in this

174
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:40,009
game. I like already love it. If you wish you can cut on any flat surface, just grab a

175
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:46,279
knife. However, what did that say? However, pans are up below that. What did that say?

176
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:51,339
There are pots stored on another shelf on the floor. All right, what did that say?

177
00:23:56,329 --> 00:23:59,930
Use the cutting board. But I said, however, the ground is preferred.

178
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:05,769
They can't, you know, if you need to use the ground, if you don't feel the need to

179
00:24:05,769 --> 00:24:09,289
prepare before the workday or you're done for the day, you can use the clock to skip

180
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:22,140
the preparation phases at the beginning and end of each day. Okay. You'll use the faucet

181
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:26,140
mainly to fill pots. Most recipes assume that you will use cold water. So stay away from

182
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:31,910
the red handle unless you're told to use it. The oven is for baking. Be sure to use

183
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:35,750
baking trays. You can find them to the right. Remember, you can bake multiple different dishes

184
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:41,319
at the same time. Oh my god, the upper switch turns the oven on and off the lower controls

185
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:46,599
the heat. Baking times correspond to the first setting. So be careful not to burn your dish.

186
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,960
Okay, okay. I feel like somebody's taking me a tour of the spaceship. And they're telling

187
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,319
like, you know, like, hey, come and come and see the cockpit, son. And it looks like a

188
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,240
fucking HAL from 2001 Space Odyssey. That's what that's what it feels like.

189
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:06,819
These are deep fryers. They're empty. You need to push the left button to fill them with oil.

190
00:25:06,819 --> 00:25:12,299
The right button drains the tank. Oh, and don't forget to use fryer baskets unless you want

191
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:16,230
third degree burns. I don't think I want that. Well, this one's pretty obvious. The grill is

192
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:19,509
for grilling. Just don't forget to flip whatever you're cooking. Most recipes require

193
00:25:19,509 --> 00:25:29,339
that. Go to the next marker. Darts? This is the dart board. The food processor. Throw the

194
00:25:29,339 --> 00:25:33,099
ingredients inside and push the button. Presto. You've got yourself a liquid blend. You can

195
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:39,750
always taste it if you forget what's inside. And it's a microwave. I don't know what this

196
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:45,700
thing is doing in a respectable kitchen. Best you forget it's here. And this, this shows why

197
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,299
this place nearly closed down. The last cook didn't even bother to bring darts. He threw

198
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:58,710
knives instead. Pathetic. Go to the next marker. You can use any of the screens in

199
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:02,549
the kitchen to view your current orders. Time left and recipe details. They're really useful.

200
00:26:03,109 --> 00:26:11,509
Okay, any screen will show that stuff. What's this? This is your desk. The radio looks old,

201
00:26:11,509 --> 00:26:15,509
but don't be fooled. You can set it to play your own mp3s and even interact

202
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:20,170
internet radio stations. The laptop won't cook for you, but it will help you run this place.

203
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:26,059
I'm sure the manager will explain everything in detail. The phone will come in handy when

204
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:29,099
something breaks down. Just pick up and walk up to whatever needs maintenance.

205
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,900
Pick it up so if it breaks, okay. Choose the service company wisely. Fast and cheap

206
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,940
might be a warning sign. Stuff might break before they even leave.

207
00:26:37,819 --> 00:26:47,740
Holy shit, this is... I'm getting gaver overwhelmed. I'm getting gamer-whelmed.

208
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:52,809
And there's the checkup. Put your dish on the shelf and choose the tablet which

209
00:26:52,809 --> 00:26:57,670
order you're about to serve. Just don't mix things up. Once it's out, it's out.

210
00:27:04,809 --> 00:27:07,720
Alright, I have no idea what's going on.

211
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,799
And the final station, the garbage bin. If it's not good enough for you,

212
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:13,720
it's not good enough for your guests. Keep that in mind.

213
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:19,720
Alright, this was just a tour, but I hope you learned something. A true chef needs to

214
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,940
know his kitchen inside out. I'm... alright. We're gonna take this slow.

215
00:27:24,579 --> 00:27:38,359
Here we go. Tutorials done. Wait a minute. Oh, fuck. I skipped two tutorials. I just...

216
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:43,049
it started here. No wonder I didn't know how to do this. Hold on.

217
00:27:43,769 --> 00:27:48,660
Hello, the manager asked me to teach you a thing or two.

218
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:55,990
I thought I could watch the third tutorial. I'll teach you how to buy...

219
00:27:56,869 --> 00:28:05,430
without wasting... Alright, this is important. I want you to walk up to the wooden racks

220
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:09,640
in the pantry. See? See those tomatoes? Buy a tomato.

221
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,289
Okay, take that tomato to the countertop and set it aside.

222
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:19,019
Time to buy a plate. It works the same as with buying products.

223
00:28:19,579 --> 00:28:22,940
Do you see what I'm talking about? How I feel like I'm like 30 feet away from this?

224
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:36,089
I feel like... yeah, it's the FOV. I think I gotta turn the FOV down.

225
00:28:42,819 --> 00:28:57,259
Right? This site... this feels a little better. We'll see how that goes.

226
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,960
Yeah, okay. This... this is context really, because look. Ready? See how far away I am

227
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:13,079
right now? Like... this is not right. I am... I'm fucking clearly very far away.

228
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:18,630
That's what's causing me all these problems. We'll do 75.

229
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:30,549
Yeah, that feels much better. Much better. I'm not gonna do the low...

230
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:32,630
Walk up to the tomatoes with the plate in hand and... okay, with...

231
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:35,509
Walk up to the tomatoes with the plate in hand and get three.

232
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:41,369
Yeah, I actually feel like I'm in the space now. Three tomatoes.

233
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:47,430
Okay, cool. So you have to like, carry stuff to plates.

234
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:56,940
All right. Cutting. This is where I fucked up last time, because I didn't know what to do.

235
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:05,880
Pay attention. I will. Easy to learn, but hard to master.

236
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:12,220
Put in the extra hours to practice once we're done. Grab the knife.

237
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:24,039
I have very clear posted streamer hours, okay? Why are you calling me during my streaming hours?

238
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:33,369
What did the tutorial just say? Okay, grab the knife.

239
00:30:36,579 --> 00:30:42,309
All right, so... now I want you to cut the tomato into at least four pieces.

240
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:45,269
Just follow the instructions in the bottom right of the screen. Four pieces.

241
00:30:46,069 --> 00:31:07,319
So like, one, two, three, four. Fuck. This is hard.

242
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:12,140
Can I like, get in closer? The chef's like, lean in and don't...

243
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,839
Okay, I know what I'm doing. Here we go. New game.

244
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:23,450
Most people skip tutorials. Don't do it.

245
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,210
Welcome to Cooking Simulator. As you've already noticed,

246
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:28,170
the restaurant you're now employed in does not have the greatest rating.

247
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:32,970
Your task is to restore it to its former glory and reach the highest level of prestige.

248
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:35,609
The last chef left the kitchen covered in sticky notes.

249
00:31:35,609 --> 00:31:39,529
Maybe they'll come to use to you, good luck. All right, here we go.

250
00:31:39,529 --> 00:31:42,839
Do you want to follow tutorial during first day? Yes.

251
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:47,430
Hi, I'm the manager of this place. Since it's your first day, I'll show you the ropes.

252
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:50,230
Wait, I didn't... I already did it. Did I need to be told twice?

253
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:53,700
I would get fired. In case you get lost.

254
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,619
Keybinding hints are always displayed in the bottom right corner, yeah?

255
00:31:59,619 --> 00:32:05,619
During the tutorial, you can view your tasks in the bottom left corner of the screen, yeah?

256
00:32:05,619 --> 00:32:09,640
Three, this tutorial will auto-save between stages.

257
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,279
If you get lost or stuck, you can always go back. Why didn't I just do this first?

258
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:17,059
All right, if you have to hold my hand the whole way through,

259
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:21,930
left this place in a sorry state. Get on the phone, we need to call some professionals.

260
00:32:24,329 --> 00:32:28,980
Oh no, he turned the stove into aluminum foil. This looks like aluminum foil.

261
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,220
This is horrible. What do you mean he left in a bad state?

262
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:34,839
Did he have a fucking sledgehammer with him?

263
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:37,000
Was he... we had a baseball bat and was swinging it around?

264
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,269
All right, so we get a call. We need to get...

265
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:44,069
We need to get that gas cooker running as soon as possible.

266
00:32:44,069 --> 00:32:47,799
So we have to go over here and say, get the gas cooker.

267
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:52,009
It'll take ages to repair that thing. We better hire someone that's fast

268
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:54,490
while hovering over the cooker press to select a company.

269
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:02,940
NiceCorp, Bakerson, Handyman at your service, Home Repair, fast and smooth,

270
00:33:03,819 --> 00:33:10,339
Fast Service. I would never use a service that was called Fast Service.

271
00:33:10,339 --> 00:33:16,630
To me, that... this is like a weird knockoff website of like this place.

272
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:21,339
They even got like a similar logo. I'm gonna go with NiceCorp.

273
00:33:21,339 --> 00:33:31,400
Okay, so that takes... that's the time. So we gotta repair everything.

274
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:36,579
How much money do I have? We'll have NiceCorp do everything.

275
00:33:36,579 --> 00:33:43,130
Gotta get a good reputation with one company. What else is just right?

276
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:48,920
Wait, do I have to do both of these? Does this count as one?

277
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:53,299
Lower Oven Left Fryer. I didn't do this one.

278
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:58,839
Lower Oven. Okay.

279
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:01,079
Put the phone away. We won't be needing it anytime soon.

280
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:02,839
So then you just wait till they're all fixed?

281
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:11,179
Okay, no time to take a breather. This place is empty and we're gonna do something about it.

282
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:15,960
You get some utensils. We gotta fill the restaurant.

283
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:21,480
Okay, I just left utensils. I don't have any utensils at all.

284
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:26,389
We need to get a blender. I'm running out of money.

285
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:28,630
Put the blender away. You can carry only one thing at a time.

286
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,989
I mean, very clearly the button says throw.

287
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,940
I can't... no. No, this is the first mission.

288
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,420
Put the blender away. Put the blender away.

289
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:51,289
I'm not going to throw it. Don't throw anything.

290
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:55,380
Hover over it and press E to pick up the box.

291
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,579
Put it down on the countertop.

292
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:00,039
Everything. You can throw everything.

293
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:03,510
I'm not going to do that right now.

294
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:05,829
Guys, this is going to be like a nice long stream.

295
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,949
You want me to automatically start spawning easy pizza?

296
00:35:08,949 --> 00:35:13,909
I don't think you want that. I don't want that.

297
00:35:13,909 --> 00:35:17,030
Okay, we need to buy a cooking tool. We need a bake tray.

298
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:22,780
So we need all this stuff. Use the shop to buy.

299
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,739
All right, so we can buy a knife.

300
00:35:25,019 --> 00:35:27,420
Oh, you got to individually put everything down.

301
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:33,369
You have a power meter.

302
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:39,420
Holy shit.

303
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,579
All right, no more throwing.

304
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,539
I need to put the knife in the knife tray.

305
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,900
There. I'm doing this.

306
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,940
I'm going to play nice.

307
00:35:55,659 --> 00:35:56,619
Pan. What does a pan go?

308
00:35:57,179 --> 00:35:58,300
Underneath here, right?

309
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:07,670
Fuck. Just put it down.

310
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,380
Put it down. Pan.

311
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:14,760
Big pot. Big pot goes under here.

312
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:21,179
Barely. Fits under there.

313
00:36:21,989 --> 00:36:22,869
Cutting board.

314
00:36:22,869 --> 00:36:24,309
Wait, how many do I need? Two big pots?

315
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:38,119
Okay. Baking tray.

316
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,179
Oh, let's get that.

317
00:36:40,179 --> 00:36:42,019
I need to remember where this shit is.

318
00:36:42,579 --> 00:36:44,940
I'm going to put it in places that I know where it's going to be.

319
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,150
All right, last one.

320
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,429
A spatula.

321
00:36:55,989 --> 00:36:58,469
I need to remember where this is going to be.

322
00:36:58,469 --> 00:37:00,699
I'm going to put it over here.

323
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:05,030
Yeah, hang it right there.

324
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:09,769
This too. Can I put it up here?

325
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:15,820
Okay. Don't it go to the laptop?

326
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,619
We need to get a recipe.

327
00:37:17,179 --> 00:37:21,989
Click on the recipe manager on the left side menu.

328
00:37:24,489 --> 00:37:28,090
Click on the not owned tab to open the recipe.

329
00:37:29,179 --> 00:37:30,300
Not owned.

330
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:34,360
Buy a recipe for baked trout.

331
00:37:35,449 --> 00:37:36,250
Look at all this.

332
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:36,969
How many are there?

333
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:40,969
Oh man, that's fucking cool.

334
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:44,489
Oh, this is awesome.

335
00:37:44,489 --> 00:37:46,170
All right. Baked trout.

336
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:50,099
So here's the recipe.

337
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:53,300
Take trout. Season with black pepper, thyme, dried, and dill.

338
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,579
I need black pepper.

339
00:37:54,579 --> 00:37:55,539
Place on a baking tray.

340
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:56,579
Bake for 90 seconds.

341
00:37:56,579 --> 00:37:57,619
Season with horseradish.

342
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,139
All right, buy it.

343
00:38:04,809 --> 00:38:06,889
Unlock salmon steak and boiled potatoes.

344
00:38:06,889 --> 00:38:08,170
Okay. I'm ready.

345
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:11,849
So we need to get fish.

346
00:38:12,409 --> 00:38:13,130
How do we do this?

347
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,170
Where's my recipe?

348
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:20,730
Oh, okay. Owned.

349
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:22,980
Seven minutes?

350
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:29,219
What do I need to...

351
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:30,179
Hold on. Not owned.

352
00:38:32,329 --> 00:38:33,690
Oh, I get it for free.

353
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:36,260
Tomato soup. Classic.

354
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,780
That should do for now.

355
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,539
We'll improve our menu once the business gets rolling.

356
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:44,300
All right.

357
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,820
Exit the laptop.

358
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:47,429
It's time to go.

359
00:38:47,989 --> 00:38:49,670
Let's see. Repairs, utensils, recipes.

360
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:50,710
Yes, we need some spices.

361
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,909
Let's visit the shop.

362
00:38:51,909 --> 00:38:56,699
We need salt.

363
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:00,380
All right. I gotta put this somewhere.

364
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,500
Somewhere where I know it's gonna be.

365
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,860
Somewhere I always know it's gonna be.

366
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:09,019
Right here. We're not open yet.

367
00:39:09,019 --> 00:39:10,619
There's going to be much time for shopping.

368
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:11,420
Not gonna be much time.

369
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,619
Best we buy all that we need now.

370
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,260
Get everything. Dried dill.

371
00:39:16,139 --> 00:39:18,360
All right. I need to know what this is gonna...

372
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:18,760
Over here.

373
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,469
Oh, no. That's fresh dill.

374
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:26,250
I'm gonna say this is the spice rack.

375
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:28,710
Should I do it alphabetical?

376
00:39:29,429 --> 00:39:30,550
Yeah. D, dill.

377
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:31,670
B, black.

378
00:39:32,389 --> 00:39:33,590
C, A, B, C.

379
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,469
All right. Hold on.

380
00:39:34,469 --> 00:39:40,710
I'm doing it alphabetical.

381
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:52,420
Then we need horseradish dried.

382
00:39:55,449 --> 00:39:57,050
QRS.

383
00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:00,150
Powdered cayenne pepper.

384
00:40:00,869 --> 00:40:01,989
All right. Here we go.

385
00:40:01,989 --> 00:40:05,500
A, B. Wait.

386
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,420
All right. So we got dill.

387
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,460
A, B, C.

388
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:17,940
B, C, D.

389
00:40:19,349 --> 00:40:20,150
E, F, G, H.

390
00:40:20,869 --> 00:40:26,119
Okay. They're alphabetical now.

391
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:27,480
I just know if it's like black pepper.

392
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:32,420
B, liquids tab.

393
00:40:35,849 --> 00:40:36,489
Chicken broth.

394
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:41,829
All the liquids are gonna go in the bottom.

395
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,420
Chicken broth.

396
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:51,380
B, sunflower oil.

397
00:40:53,400 --> 00:41:04,579
S. Wait. Does it fit in there?

398
00:41:04,579 --> 00:41:07,820
Why not?

399
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:14,179
What? It's too tall?

400
00:41:14,179 --> 00:41:15,539
No. That's too high.

401
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:27,050
I want it in here.

402
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:28,570
Oh, right. It's made out of glass.

403
00:41:29,929 --> 00:41:38,380
Wait. Can I use this?

404
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,380
How do I actually use this?

405
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,659
There we go. Move vertically.

406
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:54,090
How do I rotate it?

407
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:55,849
They didn't teach me how to use this yet.

408
00:41:55,849 --> 00:42:04,920
Where's the trash?

409
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,280
Can I scoop this all up?

410
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:12,920
I have to do it one by one.

411
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:17,699
No. There has to be something.

412
00:42:17,699 --> 00:42:19,940
Look. People break shit all the time in a restaurant.

413
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,699
If you guys ever worked in a kitchen like I have,

414
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,739
you understand how many bottles broke a day?

415
00:42:24,739 --> 00:42:27,139
You don't understand how much food was just like dropped on the ground

416
00:42:27,139 --> 00:42:29,940
and the bottle shattered and broken and wine bottles and stuff.

417
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,139
Happens like every 10 seconds.

418
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:50,920
I need...

419
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,519
Wait. I don't have any oil now.

420
00:42:52,519 --> 00:42:55,380
I need to buy sunflower oil again because I...

421
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,000
Wait, wait, wait.

422
00:42:59,239 --> 00:43:00,440
I need to bake me a baked trout.

423
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,639
Hold on. I miss an oil.

424
00:43:01,639 --> 00:43:02,760
I need this. I need the oil.

425
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,280
Sunflower oil, right?

426
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:07,500
Don't worry. You have some help.

427
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:11,239
I need oil.

428
00:43:11,239 --> 00:43:11,719
All right. Fuck it.

429
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:12,440
I'm just putting it up there.

430
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,559
Oh, God. Okay. Here we go.

431
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:14,119
Seven minutes.

432
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,480
What broke?

433
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:16,619
What?

434
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:19,320
What happened?

435
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:24,659
I don't understand.

436
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:28,599
I put it...

437
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:30,099
I did...

438
00:43:30,099 --> 00:43:30,659
Open the refrigerator.

439
00:43:30,659 --> 00:43:31,139
All right. Let's go.

440
00:43:31,699 --> 00:43:34,139
Each product costs money.

441
00:43:34,139 --> 00:43:34,940
So we need one.

442
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:36,699
You don't have to worry about supplies, but still you need...

443
00:43:36,699 --> 00:43:37,659
Okay. One trout.

444
00:43:38,539 --> 00:43:39,039
Got one.

445
00:43:39,579 --> 00:43:46,780
Okay. Black pepper.

446
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,619
Five grams.

447
00:43:48,619 --> 00:43:49,179
Black pepper.

448
00:43:49,179 --> 00:43:49,739
Where's the pepper?

449
00:43:49,739 --> 00:43:50,139
That's salt.

450
00:43:50,139 --> 00:43:50,619
Where's the pepper?

451
00:43:50,619 --> 00:43:51,179
Black pepper.

452
00:43:51,179 --> 00:43:51,679
B.

453
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,280
Dill.

454
00:43:58,579 --> 00:43:59,079
D.

455
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:04,090
Time.

456
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:04,590
T.

457
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:08,539
Okay. Here we go.

458
00:44:08,539 --> 00:44:09,260
Five grams each.

459
00:44:10,059 --> 00:44:13,980
Spin this around a little bit.

460
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:14,940
Rotate it like this.

461
00:44:16,699 --> 00:44:18,820
I want to rotate it around.

462
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:20,099
I want it sideways.

463
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:26,420
I want it sideways.

464
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:27,989
Whatever.

465
00:44:27,989 --> 00:44:28,630
Five grams.

466
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:30,309
Okay. Here we go.

467
00:44:30,309 --> 00:44:39,909
Got it.

468
00:44:39,909 --> 00:44:40,949
Dried dill.

469
00:44:40,949 --> 00:44:58,230
Pretty good evening seasoning.

470
00:44:58,230 --> 00:44:58,730
Five. Okay.

471
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:00,090
What am I...

472
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:01,750
Dill?

473
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:02,710
This dill needs dill?

474
00:45:03,269 --> 00:45:06,420
How much is on there?

475
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:06,900
That's okay.

476
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:07,960
I missed.

477
00:45:09,989 --> 00:45:10,489
Okay.

478
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:11,989
Baking tray.

479
00:45:11,989 --> 00:45:12,869
Under here.

480
00:45:12,869 --> 00:45:18,940
Oven.

481
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:32,250
Turn on the oven.

482
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:32,889
What's the degrees?

483
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,219
We need a lemon.

484
00:45:35,219 --> 00:45:42,070
How long does it take?

485
00:45:42,809 --> 00:45:45,059
Do I have a timer?

486
00:45:45,059 --> 00:45:46,099
Four pieces.

487
00:45:46,099 --> 00:45:58,659
Damn it!

488
00:45:59,219 --> 00:46:00,019
Come on!

489
00:46:00,019 --> 00:46:04,150
That's fine.

490
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:08,380
Hey, put this down.

491
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:09,800
What do I do with the lemons?

492
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,070
Is this done?

493
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:15,960
What do I do with the lemons?

494
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:23,219
This is scary.

495
00:46:23,219 --> 00:46:25,460
Imagine you go into a restaurant in the back

496
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:26,980
and the chef could be doing anything else.

497
00:46:27,849 --> 00:46:30,650
And he's just fucking staring, just waiting.

498
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:34,090
How long does it take?

499
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:38,420
How do I know when it's done?

500
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,539
It's not burnt.

501
00:46:39,539 --> 00:46:42,219
Fridge is still open.

502
00:46:42,219 --> 00:46:42,780
It's wasting it.

503
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:43,420
All right.

504
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:54,570
Don't blow up the propane tank.

505
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:59,079
That was very violent mopping.

506
00:46:59,079 --> 00:46:59,559
Is it done?

507
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,059
I need to check.

508
00:47:02,059 --> 00:47:03,670
Is it done?

509
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:03,989
It's done!

510
00:47:03,989 --> 00:47:04,309
It's done!

511
00:47:04,309 --> 00:47:04,809
It's done!

512
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:06,869
My hands!

513
00:47:06,869 --> 00:47:07,369
Ow!

514
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,000
All right.

515
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:09,800
Is it done?

516
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,869
No, it's not done.

517
00:47:16,469 --> 00:47:16,969
Oh, fuck!

518
00:47:18,099 --> 00:47:19,460
I can't feel my hands anymore.

519
00:47:22,949 --> 00:47:23,829
Okay, it's done.

520
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:38,789
I need a plate.

521
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:39,349
Okay.

522
00:47:39,349 --> 00:47:42,840
Transfer the product.

523
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:44,760
Five grams of horseradish.

524
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:50,070
My hands are probably so inflamed.

525
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:54,309
I probably have huge, huge Mickey Mouse glove hands right now

526
00:47:54,309 --> 00:47:55,590
because it's swelling up.

527
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:55,829
All right.

528
00:47:55,829 --> 00:47:56,469
Five grams.

529
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:14,099
Now pick up the lemon quarters and target them and expand.

530
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:14,599
Wait.

531
00:48:15,699 --> 00:48:15,940
Okay.

532
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:16,500
So here we go.

533
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:20,650
That looks horrible.

534
00:48:22,619 --> 00:48:23,579
That's just a joke.

535
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,780
Just serve it with one lemon.

536
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:31,019
Parsley leaves.

537
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:33,639
One, two, three.

538
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:36,380
Serve it.

539
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:37,800
Put it on the counter.

540
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,519
Wait, can I like move it around a little?

541
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:44,260
Well, okay.

542
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:45,460
Enter the...

543
00:48:46,579 --> 00:48:48,179
Like that looks bad.

544
00:48:48,820 --> 00:49:31,269
Okay, hold on.

545
00:49:31,269 --> 00:49:31,750
Looks good.

546
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:37,960
Midnight.

547
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:38,460
Okay.

548
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:48,389
Okay, hide the UI.

549
00:49:48,389 --> 00:49:48,949
Take the picture.

550
00:49:51,929 --> 00:49:52,650
Save it.

551
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:53,849
Looks fucking pretty good, actually.

552
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,760
Put it on grandma's Facebook.

553
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:57,980
Ding.

554
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:02,010
Taste?

555
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:03,820
Almost five stars.

556
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:08,760
Pretty good.

557
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:09,960
What are the complaints?

558
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:10,760
It was perfect.

559
00:50:11,239 --> 00:50:14,280
The lemon quarters were not cut perfectly.

560
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:16,469
Yeah, whatever.

561
00:50:16,469 --> 00:50:17,190
You're gonna come back.

562
00:50:18,809 --> 00:50:19,449
That's it for today.

563
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:21,449
Tomorrow we'll be open for business, so do your best.

564
00:50:21,449 --> 00:50:21,849
All right.

565
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:28,420
After each day, you'll be presented with a summary of progress the restaurant made.

566
00:50:30,039 --> 00:50:32,360
Our goal is to reach full five-star fame rating.

567
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,880
As you can see, there's still a lot ahead of us.

568
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:34,440
Yes, there is.

569
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,139
Total income, negative $1,400.

570
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:39,460
How much money do I have?

571
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:44,329
All right.

572
00:50:44,329 --> 00:50:45,050
This is where it begins.

573
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:52,059
Experience points come primarily from serving dishes and doing daily quests.

574
00:50:53,099 --> 00:50:55,420
Once you gain enough experience, you will automatically level up.

575
00:50:56,059 --> 00:50:59,210
We get to choose a perk.

576
00:51:00,219 --> 00:51:01,019
There are perks.

577
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:02,400
Okay.

578
00:51:03,019 --> 00:51:05,960
Perks are very powerful unique abilities.

579
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,840
Once every few levels, you'll be given an option to choose one.

580
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,760
This choice can't be postponed or undone,

581
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,480
so take your time and pick what you think will be the most useful.

582
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,860
Can you view perks?

583
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:19,699
You're already using your perk browser app.

584
00:51:19,699 --> 00:51:20,420
Okay, hold on.

585
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:21,219
Long reach.

586
00:51:21,219 --> 00:51:22,099
Long arms.

587
00:51:22,099 --> 00:51:24,340
Longer reach from picking up and putting down items.

588
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:25,940
Have really long fucking arms.

589
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:28,039
Fast feet.

590
00:51:28,039 --> 00:51:30,039
Get at three skill points that are unlocking a perk.

591
00:51:32,019 --> 00:51:32,739
Steady hands.

592
00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:36,840
Hold down shift to freeze items in place while cutting.

593
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,519
That's what's going on here.

594
00:51:38,519 --> 00:51:39,239
I want this one.

595
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:46,230
Lower score requirements.

596
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:47,590
Pass the food critics.

597
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:50,309
Learn the temperature of ingredients in a closed oven.

598
00:51:50,309 --> 00:51:51,269
Oh, that's good.

599
00:51:55,139 --> 00:51:56,500
Time slows down while cutting.

600
00:51:57,219 --> 00:52:00,070
Once per day, reset the timer of an active order.

601
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:06,869
Reroll order grants a magic wand that removes all stains and shards.

602
00:52:06,869 --> 00:52:07,909
I mean steady hands.

603
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:09,719
That's...

604
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:10,679
I have to use that.

605
00:52:14,679 --> 00:52:16,519
Skill points are used to unlock and upgrade skills.

606
00:52:16,519 --> 00:52:19,159
With each level, you gain a certain amount of SPs.

607
00:52:19,159 --> 00:52:19,880
You can spend them...

608
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:20,199
Okay.

609
00:52:21,659 --> 00:52:22,619
What do I have for points?

610
00:52:22,619 --> 00:52:23,260
I got three.

611
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:25,719
Oh my god.

612
00:52:33,059 --> 00:52:37,590
All right, so income.

613
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:40,150
Pay 10% more for their orders without affecting the score.

614
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:43,269
10% more cooking points.

615
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:46,820
Kitchen decorations are cheaper.

616
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:49,940
You earn 50 more experience points for dish stars.

617
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:53,059
Chain four star dishes to earn more fame.

618
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:55,380
Liquids cost less.

619
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,500
Products cost less.

620
00:52:59,829 --> 00:53:01,110
Spices are less.

621
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:02,789
Gifts, guest tip, more.

622
00:53:03,429 --> 00:53:07,289
I think I'm gonna go with they pay more money.

623
00:53:10,739 --> 00:53:12,739
Yeah, I want 30% more money.

624
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:16,900
All right, the joke's over.

625
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,099
It's time to fucking actually play.

626
00:53:18,659 --> 00:53:21,239
This is the real game now.

627
00:53:24,789 --> 00:53:26,059
All right, here we go.

628
00:53:26,699 --> 00:53:30,059
Remember, everything you serve today will affect your reputation.

629
00:53:30,699 --> 00:53:33,099
Let's do this.

630
00:53:33,099 --> 00:53:34,699
Let's make the best restaurant in the city.

631
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:40,869
By throwing the propane tank into the microwave and turning it off for five minutes.

632
00:53:41,429 --> 00:53:43,050
The name should tell the story.

633
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:46,010
No orders yet, but you can use anything in the kitchen to prepare for the day.

634
00:53:46,809 --> 00:53:49,179
Make sure to prepare the ingredients you'll be using.

635
00:53:49,179 --> 00:53:51,739
Getting a head start on some of the dishes is also a good idea.

636
00:53:51,739 --> 00:53:52,940
As long as you know what you're doing.

637
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:55,739
There's fucking rumors in this game.

638
00:53:58,039 --> 00:54:00,280
I just had a flash of...

639
00:54:02,409 --> 00:54:03,130
Okay, hold on.

640
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:08,920
I feel bad right now.

641
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:09,159
Okay.

642
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:10,840
Let's pick what we left off.

643
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:11,960
Open the skill manager app.

644
00:54:14,059 --> 00:54:14,699
That's bright.

645
00:54:16,409 --> 00:54:17,050
Mm-hmm.

646
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:20,440
If you didn't spend your skill points, you can do so now.

647
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:20,760
I did.

648
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:26,710
You can choose to save up points and use the app later.

649
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:27,030
Okay.

650
00:54:29,079 --> 00:54:30,280
You can get decorations.

651
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:34,280
Reset all of your points, but that's going to cost you money.

652
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:36,090
Makes sense.

653
00:54:38,789 --> 00:54:39,590
Perk browser.

654
00:54:41,219 --> 00:54:43,460
You can actually select perks.

655
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:44,739
It's like Call of Duty.

656
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:46,469
All right.

657
00:54:46,469 --> 00:54:48,469
Okay, hold down shift to freeze items while cutting.

658
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:50,539
All right, let's go.

659
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:52,980
Yikes, look at the time.

660
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:54,179
We need to open right away.

661
00:54:54,179 --> 00:54:54,900
Let's get cooking.

662
00:54:56,139 --> 00:54:56,780
What?

663
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:57,420
It's time to...

664
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:57,980
I'm not ready.

665
00:54:58,699 --> 00:55:00,619
I thought you might still need me today, so I'm here.

666
00:55:00,619 --> 00:55:01,420
But only for today.

667
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:02,460
Don't get too attached.

668
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:06,070
Dish salmon.

669
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:07,989
Oh, I actually have a timer now.

670
00:55:08,869 --> 00:55:09,510
Find a big pot.

671
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:10,550
We'll need to boil the potatoes.

672
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:20,179
Fill it with one cup of water.

673
00:55:20,179 --> 00:55:22,869
How do I know how much water I'm going to get?

674
00:55:22,869 --> 00:55:24,300
How do I turn it on?

675
00:55:26,179 --> 00:55:27,460
How do I turn the faucet on?

676
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:30,519
No, is this cold or hot?

677
00:55:30,519 --> 00:55:31,400
That's hot water.

678
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:31,639
All right.

679
00:55:31,639 --> 00:55:33,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

680
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:33,719
Cold water.

681
00:55:33,719 --> 00:55:34,920
E.

682
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:35,639
How much water?

683
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:41,820
I feel like I'm at a gas station.

684
00:55:42,219 --> 00:55:49,820
Okay, got it.

685
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:50,860
20 grams of salt?

686
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:51,739
That's too much salt.

687
00:55:56,170 --> 00:55:57,050
Ugh.

688
00:55:57,050 --> 00:56:00,360
We need two potatoes.

689
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:10,260
Potatoes.

690
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:10,579
Two of them.

691
00:56:10,579 --> 00:56:11,139
How do I buy two?

692
00:56:11,139 --> 00:56:11,940
Can I buy more than one?

693
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:19,659
All right.

694
00:56:19,659 --> 00:56:20,460
Boil potatoes.

695
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:22,579
Cook for 120 seconds.

696
00:56:23,219 --> 00:56:25,780
Is this the right one?

697
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:28,170
Okay, that's the right one.

698
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:29,050
120 seconds.

699
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:29,690
Count.

700
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:30,489
One.

701
00:56:30,489 --> 00:56:31,130
Two.

702
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:32,010
Where were we at?

703
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:33,030
10?

704
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:33,909
Okay, so 10...

705
00:56:33,909 --> 00:56:35,590
120 seconds is two minutes.

706
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:37,349
So when this gets to 10, twice.

707
00:56:37,349 --> 00:56:37,829
Okay, go.

708
00:56:47,539 --> 00:56:48,739
Okay, boil potato.

709
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:49,300
Boil...

710
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:52,739
Where's my cutting board?

711
00:56:52,739 --> 00:56:53,539
Okay, got salmon.

712
00:56:59,380 --> 00:56:59,780
I just got...

713
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:00,500
I already have one.

714
00:57:01,429 --> 00:57:02,230
I have one.

715
00:57:02,789 --> 00:57:03,349
All right.

716
00:57:03,349 --> 00:57:04,150
Fish on the cutting board.

717
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:04,469
Got it.

718
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:08,389
We need salt and black pepper.

719
00:57:08,389 --> 00:57:10,230
How much do we need?

720
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:11,030
5 grams?

721
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:17,670
Okay, black pepper.

722
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:20,579
10?

723
00:57:21,909 --> 00:57:22,230
Okay.

724
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:23,909
Where's the pepper?

725
00:57:23,909 --> 00:57:25,900
Where's black pepper?

726
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:26,699
Where's black pepper?

727
00:57:26,699 --> 00:57:33,739
Give me it.

728
00:57:33,739 --> 00:57:38,440
Frying in oil.

729
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,239
Oh my god.

730
00:57:40,699 --> 00:57:41,739
Put it back in.

731
00:57:41,739 --> 00:57:42,699
Put it back in.

732
00:57:42,699 --> 00:57:44,309
How do I put it back in?

733
00:57:44,309 --> 00:57:44,809
Okay.

734
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:47,210
Okay.

735
00:57:50,599 --> 00:57:51,800
I need sunflower oil.

736
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,199
Well, don't step on the glass.

737
00:57:54,199 --> 00:57:55,239
Watch out for your bare feet.

738
00:57:56,409 --> 00:57:58,230
How much oil do I need in the pan?

739
00:57:58,230 --> 00:57:59,510
10 milliliters.

740
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:09,559
Tilt the bottle.

741
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:13,500
Oh!

742
00:58:14,519 --> 00:58:19,300
Get the salmon in there.

743
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:20,340
That looks fucking amazing.

744
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:21,860
I have bugs on it.

745
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:23,300
Why are there ants on this?

746
00:58:24,739 --> 00:58:26,099
Fry the steak for 60 seconds.

747
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:30,019
10?

748
00:58:30,019 --> 00:58:31,750
Are they done?

749
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:34,579
Wait, are these done?

750
00:58:34,579 --> 00:58:36,420
Oh, that's not real time.

751
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:39,539
Hold.

752
00:58:39,539 --> 00:58:39,940
Okay.

753
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:41,059
What do I do with this?

754
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:44,760
Pick up the potato straight from the pot into the plate.

755
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,539
What plate?

756
00:58:46,539 --> 00:58:48,309
What plate?

757
00:58:48,309 --> 00:58:48,630
Plate.

758
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:49,190
I need plate.

759
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:51,159
Basic plate.

760
00:58:51,159 --> 00:58:51,719
Deep plate.

761
00:58:55,659 --> 00:58:59,320
Okay.

762
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:00,360
Just put this down.

763
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:02,780
How about the salmon?

764
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:06,539
Is the salmon doing all right?

765
00:59:06,539 --> 00:59:07,420
Why is it not cooking?

766
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:08,300
Okay, hold on.

767
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:09,820
Do I have to cut these?

768
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:10,780
Oh, god damn it.

769
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:11,420
It's not on.

770
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:12,469
Okay, hold on.

771
00:59:12,469 --> 00:59:24,550
Spatula.

772
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:25,269
When do I flip it?

773
00:59:27,639 --> 00:59:29,239
Don't you not flip salmon?

774
00:59:29,239 --> 00:59:30,360
I know how to cook salmon.

775
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:31,000
You don't flip it.

776
00:59:31,719 --> 00:59:32,440
You cover it.

777
00:59:33,239 --> 00:59:33,880
Where's the coven?

778
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:36,570
Where's the coven for the oven?

779
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:37,369
Where's the coven?

780
00:59:37,369 --> 00:59:39,530
Where are the vampire ladies that are gonna eat me?

781
00:59:46,969 --> 00:59:47,849
These are gonna get cold.

782
00:59:49,369 --> 00:59:50,170
How much time do I have?

783
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:52,440
Three minutes.

784
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:58,920
Can I turn the heat up?

785
01:00:04,090 --> 01:00:05,130
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

786
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:06,650
Let's go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

787
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,599
Wait, now it's...

788
01:00:20,599 --> 01:00:21,320
Now I can't.

789
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,039
I have to do it again.

790
01:00:24,039 --> 01:00:24,679
Flip it again.

791
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:26,309
Okay, we're good.

792
01:00:28,039 --> 01:00:28,840
60 seconds.

793
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:29,719
Timer.

794
01:00:29,719 --> 01:00:40,230
All right, 50 seconds.

795
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:50,010
Is it almost done?

796
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:55,909
What do I do in the meantime?

797
01:00:55,909 --> 01:00:56,550
I got two minutes.

798
01:00:56,550 --> 01:00:57,429
I'm fine.

799
01:00:57,429 --> 01:00:59,050
I think I'm gonna have to cut up the potatoes though.

800
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:00,329
Are they still hot?

801
01:01:00,329 --> 01:01:01,369
Yeah, they are.

802
01:01:01,369 --> 01:01:02,360
Let me test.

803
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:08,760
Give me this.

804
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:16,059
I just heard a rumor.

805
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:22,679
All right.

806
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:24,539
Come on.

807
01:01:25,619 --> 01:01:26,260
How much time?

808
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:28,780
I still got a little bit of time.

809
01:01:32,579 --> 01:01:33,619
Perfectly calculated.

810
01:01:41,219 --> 01:01:41,699
Put it down.

811
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:43,539
Just put the salmon down.

812
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:46,780
That's not cooked on the bottom.

813
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,780
Stop it!

814
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:50,260
Leave me a...

815
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:58,920
Pick up the plate with the salmon.

816
01:02:02,619 --> 01:02:03,900
Put the plate on the serving shell.

817
01:02:04,539 --> 01:02:05,739
This is not ready to serve.

818
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:10,780
You just want two fucking baked potatoes?

819
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:12,219
This is not even food.

820
01:02:13,019 --> 01:02:13,260
What?

821
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:18,570
This looks like a dessert.

822
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:19,449
This looks like a cake.

823
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:35,239
No, that's a cake.

824
01:02:41,539 --> 01:02:43,780
Imagine being served salmon like this.

825
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:44,980
Sitting up on its side.

826
01:02:46,059 --> 01:02:46,940
You'd be like...

827
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:48,219
The chef is fucking drunk.

828
01:02:59,269 --> 01:03:00,150
Not bad, actually.

829
01:03:04,579 --> 01:03:05,780
I got a seven cent tip.

830
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:07,380
What were the complaints?

831
01:03:09,289 --> 01:03:10,570
Heating mistakes.

832
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:12,940
Too much oil on the steak.

833
01:03:14,329 --> 01:03:14,730
Yeah.

834
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:18,619
Well, he still ate it.

835
01:03:18,619 --> 01:03:19,420
No time for slacking off.

836
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:20,059
Next order is here.

837
01:03:20,059 --> 01:03:20,860
Tomato soup.

838
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:23,260
Wait, what do I have to do?

839
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:24,940
We need a big pot.

840
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:25,260
Find one.

841
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:25,980
Make sure it's empty.

842
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:27,369
Oh, fuck.

843
01:03:27,369 --> 01:03:28,409
This is still boiling.

844
01:03:28,409 --> 01:03:36,139
I'm trying to get it in the sink.

845
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:42,170
I'm gonna get myself a headache.

846
01:03:44,869 --> 01:03:46,949
You just throw that into the ground.

847
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:51,019
How do I open this?

848
01:03:52,139 --> 01:03:53,579
Open the chicken broth.

849
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:54,300
How much do we need?

850
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:55,820
700 milliliters?

851
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:56,219
All right.

852
01:03:56,219 --> 01:03:56,860
Get it in there.

853
01:03:59,639 --> 01:04:01,000
Stop pouring it.

854
01:04:04,789 --> 01:04:05,190
All right.

855
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:06,070
Season the broth.

856
01:04:07,269 --> 01:04:13,190
I need cayenne pepper to the pot.

857
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:14,230
12 grams.

858
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:18,710
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

859
01:04:19,349 --> 01:04:22,099
And we need some cayenne pepper.

860
01:04:22,099 --> 01:04:22,820
Where's cayenne?

861
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:24,099
Horseradish.

862
01:04:24,739 --> 01:04:25,139
Cayenne?

863
01:04:26,019 --> 01:04:26,739
Time.

864
01:04:26,739 --> 01:04:28,179
I need cayenne.

865
01:04:28,179 --> 01:04:28,500
Now.

866
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:32,619
I need it right now.

867
01:04:32,619 --> 01:04:33,659
Six grams.

868
01:04:33,659 --> 01:04:37,099
Good.

869
01:04:37,099 --> 01:04:37,420
Okay.

870
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:38,139
I need tomatoes.

871
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:42,219
Add fucking salt.

872
01:04:42,219 --> 01:04:42,619
God damn it.

873
01:04:42,619 --> 01:04:43,500
Where is it?

874
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:51,480
Okay.

875
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:52,199
Done.

876
01:04:52,199 --> 01:04:56,630
Take the pot into the pantry and put eight tomatoes in here.

877
01:05:03,829 --> 01:05:04,949
Eight tomatoes.

878
01:05:04,949 --> 01:05:05,909
We need an onion.

879
01:05:05,909 --> 01:05:06,150
What?

880
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:11,579
This isn't how you make tomato soup.

881
01:05:15,099 --> 01:05:16,059
Why do I get gas?

882
01:05:22,059 --> 01:05:22,300
Oh.

883
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:30,119
Okay.

884
01:05:30,119 --> 01:05:31,159
Boil the soup.

885
01:05:31,159 --> 01:05:33,460
How much time do I got?

886
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:33,940
Five minutes.

887
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:34,820
I got plenty of time.

888
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:36,760
What was in here?

889
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:37,000
What?

890
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:49,059
I guess you can throw that away.

891
01:05:49,059 --> 01:05:49,539
Hold on.

892
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:53,019
This is dirty.

893
01:05:53,019 --> 01:05:54,219
I need to throw it away.

894
01:06:01,289 --> 01:06:03,210
Fucking dogshit restaurant.

895
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:03,929
This is so fun.

896
01:06:03,929 --> 01:06:05,210
How do I clean the top?

897
01:06:05,769 --> 01:06:07,849
How do I clean in there?

898
01:06:07,849 --> 01:06:14,550
Is it boiling yet?

899
01:06:18,679 --> 01:06:19,719
Can I buy a sponge?

900
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:24,679
All right.

901
01:06:24,679 --> 01:06:25,320
This is...

902
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:26,440
They're almost done.

903
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:32,389
Turn off the heat and blend the contents.

904
01:06:32,389 --> 01:06:32,630
What?

905
01:06:33,349 --> 01:06:40,570
Okay.

906
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:41,050
Turn it on.

907
01:06:55,739 --> 01:06:56,460
I'm trying to draw.

908
01:06:57,019 --> 01:06:58,389
It's a mouse scroll?

909
01:06:59,449 --> 01:07:00,170
Oh my god.

910
01:07:00,969 --> 01:07:15,820
All right.

911
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:16,059
Done.

912
01:07:16,619 --> 01:07:19,849
Okay.

913
01:07:19,849 --> 01:07:20,650
What do I need now?

914
01:07:20,650 --> 01:07:21,690
Pour sour cream?

915
01:07:22,329 --> 01:07:24,139
Pour sour cream.

916
01:07:24,139 --> 01:07:24,940
Whisk sour cream.

917
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:26,550
I already have it.

918
01:07:26,550 --> 01:07:33,500
It's already over here.

919
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:33,820
Okay.

920
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:34,860
This is not...

921
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:36,139
You have to easily till.

922
01:07:36,139 --> 01:07:36,780
How much?

923
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:37,340
150.

924
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:47,139
No.

925
01:07:52,329 --> 01:07:52,889
Deep plate.

926
01:07:56,820 --> 01:07:57,059
Okay.

927
01:07:58,019 --> 01:08:00,340
Take the pot and target the deep plate.

928
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:02,500
And press to hold down while pouring this...

929
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:02,659
Wait.

930
01:08:02,659 --> 01:08:02,980
You don't...

931
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:04,179
I have to pour the soup?

932
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:13,139
Nobody doesn't use...

933
01:08:13,139 --> 01:08:13,619
You lay...

934
01:08:13,619 --> 01:08:14,900
It was a ladle.

935
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:21,109
This is not what I'm supposed to do, right?

936
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:29,050
That was the whole pot.

937
01:08:29,050 --> 01:08:33,510
This is a huge serving.

938
01:08:33,510 --> 01:09:03,930
Imagine being served a full pot of tomato soup.

939
01:09:03,930 --> 01:09:05,449
That's a full five right there.

940
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:10,979
Any complaints?

941
01:09:12,250 --> 01:09:14,170
Technique was perfect.

942
01:09:14,170 --> 01:09:15,289
Wrong amount of product.

943
01:09:16,810 --> 01:09:18,409
What do you mean wrong amount of product?

944
01:09:18,409 --> 01:09:20,409
Are they done with 149?

945
01:09:20,409 --> 01:09:24,779
Whatever.

946
01:09:24,779 --> 01:09:25,420
I'm still going.

947
01:09:28,899 --> 01:09:29,699
One baked trout.

948
01:09:29,699 --> 01:09:30,579
I remember this one.

949
01:09:30,579 --> 01:09:31,380
I can do this one quick.

950
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:31,859
Okay.

951
01:09:31,859 --> 01:09:33,460
Jess, this one...

952
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:34,180
I can do it on my own.

953
01:09:34,979 --> 01:09:35,380
Okay.

954
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:35,939
Baked trout.

955
01:09:35,939 --> 01:09:36,819
Remember, on my own.

956
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:44,569
I need a tray.

957
01:09:44,569 --> 01:09:45,449
Where's the tray?

958
01:09:45,449 --> 01:09:49,720
Where's the baking sheet?

959
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:50,359
Bingo.

960
01:09:50,359 --> 01:09:50,920
Okay.

961
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:51,399
I need...

962
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:53,180
What do I need here?

963
01:09:53,180 --> 01:09:53,819
I need...

964
01:09:53,819 --> 01:09:54,140
I need...

965
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:54,699
Let me...

966
01:09:54,699 --> 01:09:55,260
I need a...

967
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:55,899
How do I...

968
01:09:55,899 --> 01:09:56,300
What?

969
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:57,180
Let me see.

970
01:09:57,180 --> 01:10:00,979
How do I determine what I need?

971
01:10:00,979 --> 01:10:05,079
I need salt and pepper, right?

972
01:10:05,079 --> 01:10:06,359
Where's the thing to look at?

973
01:10:06,359 --> 01:10:06,840
The salt...

974
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:07,239
Hold on.

975
01:10:07,239 --> 01:10:07,640
Right here.

976
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:14,439
Pepper, thyme, dill.

977
01:10:15,689 --> 01:10:16,729
Pepper, thyme, dill.

978
01:10:23,270 --> 01:10:25,750
Two, three, four, five.

979
01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:27,189
Get it on there.

980
01:10:27,189 --> 01:10:27,670
Five.

981
01:10:27,670 --> 01:10:27,829
Okay.

982
01:10:27,829 --> 01:10:28,149
Come on.

983
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:30,569
Thyme.

984
01:10:39,699 --> 01:10:42,140
Pepper.

985
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:43,500
Where's that black pepper?

986
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:44,739
That salt?

987
01:10:47,979 --> 01:10:48,619
Oh, come on.

988
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:49,100
Where is it?

989
01:10:50,489 --> 01:10:50,890
Right there.

990
01:10:54,729 --> 01:10:56,569
One, two, three, four, five.

991
01:10:57,210 --> 01:10:58,710
What's next?

992
01:10:59,720 --> 01:10:59,960
Okay.

993
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:01,479
Baking tray.

994
01:11:01,479 --> 01:11:02,439
Bake for 90 seconds.

995
01:11:02,439 --> 01:11:03,479
Season with horseradish.

996
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:07,260
After?

997
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:08,630
After.

998
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:09,029
Okay.

999
01:11:09,029 --> 01:11:09,510
90 seconds.

1000
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:09,989
Get it in there.

1001
01:11:22,539 --> 01:11:23,100
Get it in.

1002
01:11:25,340 --> 01:11:28,020
This is still on.

1003
01:11:29,979 --> 01:11:31,100
I just burnt.

1004
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:33,500
I just singed my fucking eyebrows.

1005
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:40,779
Nice clown laugh, by the way.

1006
01:11:41,979 --> 01:11:44,260
All right.

1007
01:11:44,260 --> 01:11:46,819
Now I need lemon cut into quarters.

1008
01:11:56,470 --> 01:11:59,220
This is where I get a hold down shift.

1009
01:11:59,220 --> 01:11:59,619
Freeze.

1010
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:03,050
Freeze product into quarters.

1011
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:03,529
So here we go.

1012
01:12:03,529 --> 01:12:04,729
Let's get it nice and neat here.

1013
01:12:08,119 --> 01:12:15,739
Bang.

1014
01:12:15,739 --> 01:12:16,060
Bang.

1015
01:12:22,039 --> 01:12:23,130
Done.

1016
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:23,850
90 seconds.

1017
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:28,619
I need to see in there.

1018
01:12:28,619 --> 01:12:29,420
How long has it been?

1019
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:33,770
Okay, it's almost done.

1020
01:12:33,770 --> 01:12:40,939
And then we need dried horseradish.

1021
01:12:40,939 --> 01:12:41,500
And then...

1022
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:45,800
So get it on a plate.

1023
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:47,560
Garnish with parsley leaves.

1024
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:48,439
Six grams.

1025
01:12:48,439 --> 01:12:59,100
I need a plate.

1026
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:04,699
Basic plate.

1027
01:13:04,699 --> 01:13:05,340
Is it done?

1028
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:08,279
I'm burning my fucking hands.

1029
01:13:11,529 --> 01:13:12,090
No.

1030
01:13:12,090 --> 01:13:12,729
Hold on.

1031
01:13:12,729 --> 01:13:15,770
Just put it back in.

1032
01:13:15,770 --> 01:13:16,890
Just put it on the fucking table.

1033
01:13:18,090 --> 01:13:21,000
Jesus.

1034
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,949
Horseradish first.

1035
01:13:22,949 --> 01:13:23,750
Five grams.

1036
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:30,020
Get it on the plate.

1037
01:13:35,939 --> 01:13:37,380
Six grams of parsley.

1038
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:38,500
Two, four, six.

1039
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:48,100
Get those lemons on there.

1040
01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:48,819
Wait, I need to like...

1041
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:52,260
Okay, that looks a little better.

1042
01:13:52,979 --> 01:13:53,380
Done.

1043
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:53,779
Bingo.

1044
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:18,140
What do you think?

1045
01:14:18,140 --> 01:14:19,260
I didn't have any help on that one.

1046
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:19,979
Got them all perfect.

1047
01:14:22,569 --> 01:14:23,850
You got to hold the basics pretty quickly.

1048
01:14:23,850 --> 01:14:25,130
So what's the master plan, you might ask.

1049
01:14:25,130 --> 01:14:28,890
Well, I want this place to go from snow stars to five stars.

1050
01:14:30,779 --> 01:14:33,880
Not in the red today.

1051
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:35,560
Each dish you serve affects our fame score.

1052
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:36,680
Do well and the score goes up.

1053
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:38,539
Mess up and we're going down.

1054
01:14:38,539 --> 01:14:39,739
I made 108 cents.

1055
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:42,789
We need attractive food critic.

1056
01:14:42,789 --> 01:14:46,310
To do that, we have to meet a fame score quota at the end of the day.

1057
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:48,729
And I did it.

1058
01:14:50,649 --> 01:14:51,210
I got to 30.

1059
01:14:51,210 --> 01:14:51,770
I got 34.

1060
01:14:56,579 --> 01:14:58,340
There's a food critic coming in at the end of today.

1061
01:14:59,460 --> 01:14:59,859
Already?

1062
01:14:59,859 --> 01:15:00,500
We just opened.

1063
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:05,659
Going over the quota to have some breathing space just in case.

1064
01:15:05,659 --> 01:15:06,140
Yeah, I did.

1065
01:15:06,779 --> 01:15:10,020
A food critic wants to try your cooking tomorrow.

1066
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:11,859
Impress him and we're guaranteed a fame star.

1067
01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:15,449
Once the critic is here, focus on his order.

1068
01:15:15,449 --> 01:15:17,850
Score at least four stars to pass his exam.

1069
01:15:19,159 --> 01:15:20,439
Tomorrow, we're getting inspected.

1070
01:15:20,439 --> 01:15:22,199
It's a great chance to raise our fame.

1071
01:15:22,199 --> 01:15:22,680
Be ready.

1072
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:24,199
Well, I need to clean the kitchen.

1073
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:30,220
Level up.

1074
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:30,779
Skill point.

1075
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:33,779
What do you think?

1076
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:34,260
More money?

1077
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:37,560
Yeah, I want 50% more money.

1078
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:42,090
I think we should expand our menu.

1079
01:15:42,090 --> 01:15:43,689
Look at the dishes below and pick your favorite.

1080
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:49,380
Pork chops with baked potatoes or simple Ukrainian borscht.

1081
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:52,970
This takes nine minutes.

1082
01:15:52,970 --> 01:15:54,170
This takes seven.

1083
01:15:54,170 --> 01:15:55,859
Borscht?

1084
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:06,680
Chicken broth, salt, black pepper, beetroot, onion, carrot, parsley.

1085
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:07,800
Boil for 120 seconds.

1086
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:11,420
I can handle this.

1087
01:16:12,699 --> 01:16:13,420
Yeah, let's get it.

1088
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:20,220
Beetroot is our new ingredient.

1089
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:26,149
You'll find it in the shop and the larder.

1090
01:16:26,149 --> 01:16:27,109
Carrot is a new ingredient.

1091
01:16:27,109 --> 01:16:28,310
You find it in the shop and the larder.

1092
01:16:29,770 --> 01:16:30,170
Parsley.

1093
01:16:30,170 --> 01:16:31,609
It can be found both in the shop and the larder.

1094
01:16:31,609 --> 01:16:32,489
Yeah, I got new ingredients.

1095
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:34,279
All right, good.

1096
01:16:34,279 --> 01:16:35,000
Okay, I got time.

1097
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:35,640
I got three minutes.

1098
01:16:36,199 --> 01:16:38,149
Someone's coming to investigate this place.

1099
01:16:38,789 --> 01:16:39,750
We got to clean this up now.

1100
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:48,619
Within an hour.

1101
01:16:48,619 --> 01:16:51,140
There's no faster.

1102
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:52,340
I can't drag this over here.

1103
01:16:54,170 --> 01:16:55,689
Food critic's going to be here in three hours.

1104
01:16:55,689 --> 01:16:56,170
Just mop.

1105
01:16:56,729 --> 01:17:08,500
We're getting health inspected.

1106
01:17:09,619 --> 01:17:10,180
Anything else?

1107
01:17:10,180 --> 01:17:11,779
The fridge has been open all night.

1108
01:17:11,779 --> 01:17:12,260
That's great.

1109
01:17:12,979 --> 01:17:13,850
Okay, I got to...

1110
01:17:14,729 --> 01:17:15,689
How do I clean up that?

1111
01:17:16,329 --> 01:17:17,449
I don't think I can reach this.

1112
01:17:20,569 --> 01:17:21,369
Move vertically.

1113
01:17:23,539 --> 01:17:24,020
Rotate.

1114
01:17:24,659 --> 01:17:26,869
I can't get it in there.

1115
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:33,270
Advanced controls.

1116
01:17:33,270 --> 01:17:33,989
Move vertically.

1117
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:36,470
They can't do anything about it.

1118
01:17:36,470 --> 01:17:36,949
Rotate.

1119
01:17:37,909 --> 01:17:38,710
Move vertically.

1120
01:17:40,359 --> 01:17:40,760
Sponge.

1121
01:17:41,399 --> 01:17:44,840
Utensils?

1122
01:17:45,479 --> 01:17:46,439
Oh my goodness.

1123
01:17:47,779 --> 01:17:48,340
Spatula.

1124
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:48,659
Bucket.

1125
01:17:48,659 --> 01:17:49,060
Sponge.

1126
01:17:59,100 --> 01:17:59,899
How do I use it?

1127
01:18:01,130 --> 01:18:01,609
Rotate.

1128
01:18:01,609 --> 01:18:02,010
Throw.

1129
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:02,890
Advanced controls.

1130
01:18:02,890 --> 01:18:03,449
Rotate.

1131
01:18:03,449 --> 01:18:03,770
Drop.

1132
01:18:04,329 --> 01:18:08,699
I didn't even know you could crouch in the game.

1133
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:14,630
Good.

1134
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:17,159
Clean that up.

1135
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:23,420
Good.

1136
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:23,819
Anything else?

1137
01:18:23,819 --> 01:18:24,380
What else?

1138
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:25,420
There's shit all over here too.

1139
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:30,039
It's the Mr. Clean Magic Eraser.

1140
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:35,380
All right.

1141
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:36,899
I had fucking three sponges already.

1142
01:18:36,899 --> 01:18:37,460
Great.

1143
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:38,020
Fantastic.

1144
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:38,260
Okay.

1145
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:40,340
Time to open.

1146
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:40,979
44 seconds.

1147
01:18:40,979 --> 01:18:41,300
What else?

1148
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:42,420
We got anything else?

1149
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:46,279
I got to make things a little nicer in here.

1150
01:18:47,350 --> 01:18:48,869
Just get it ready for the day.

1151
01:18:51,210 --> 01:18:51,689
What about...

1152
01:18:53,619 --> 01:18:54,659
This oven's been on.

1153
01:18:54,659 --> 01:18:55,300
I can clean the oven.

1154
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:55,859
Turn the oven off.

1155
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:01,859
Clean.

1156
01:19:01,859 --> 01:19:02,020
What?

1157
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:02,659
I can't clean it?

1158
01:19:03,220 --> 01:19:03,460
Clean.

1159
01:19:06,090 --> 01:19:07,449
What the fuck is going on?

1160
01:19:08,329 --> 01:19:09,930
Why am I wiping the tile?

1161
01:19:11,529 --> 01:19:12,489
How do I zoom out?

1162
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,079
What the hell is happening?

1163
01:19:29,770 --> 01:19:30,090
Okay.

1164
01:19:30,090 --> 01:19:30,890
I can...

1165
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:31,449
New order.

1166
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:38,520
Chicken broth.

1167
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:38,840
Salt.

1168
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:40,600
Pour the liquid...

1169
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:40,760
Okay.

1170
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:41,720
So I just need a...

1171
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:43,819
I just need a big pot.

1172
01:19:43,819 --> 01:19:45,500
A thousand milliliters of chicken broth.

1173
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:47,689
Pot.

1174
01:19:47,689 --> 01:19:48,569
Big one.

1175
01:19:48,569 --> 01:19:50,840
Is this clean?

1176
01:19:51,399 --> 01:19:54,659
It's clean.

1177
01:19:54,659 --> 01:19:54,979
It's clean.

1178
01:19:54,979 --> 01:19:55,539
It's clean, right?

1179
01:19:56,729 --> 01:19:57,449
That looks pretty clean.

1180
01:19:58,010 --> 01:19:58,550
All right.

1181
01:19:58,550 --> 01:19:59,109
Get it on here.

1182
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:00,250
Here we go.

1183
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:00,569
Here we go.

1184
01:20:00,569 --> 01:20:00,890
Here we go.

1185
01:20:02,659 --> 01:20:03,699
Chicken broth.

1186
01:20:03,699 --> 01:20:10,199
What?

1187
01:20:10,199 --> 01:20:10,520
Oh shit.

1188
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:11,000
It's empty.

1189
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:14,579
Buy one.

1190
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:25,420
What's a...

1191
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:26,859
What's a thousand minus 164?

1192
01:20:32,729 --> 01:20:33,210
Three.

1193
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:33,930
Okay.

1194
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:43,369
Oh fucking perfect!

1195
01:20:44,229 --> 01:20:45,109
It was perfect!

1196
01:20:47,060 --> 01:20:47,539
Okay.

1197
01:20:47,539 --> 01:20:50,489
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1198
01:20:50,489 --> 01:20:50,810
Salt.

1199
01:20:50,810 --> 01:20:51,289
20 grams.

1200
01:20:51,289 --> 01:20:51,529
Pepper.

1201
01:20:51,529 --> 01:20:52,250
20 grams.

1202
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:52,649
Salt.

1203
01:20:52,649 --> 01:20:53,130
20 grams.

1204
01:20:53,130 --> 01:20:53,369
Pepper.

1205
01:20:53,369 --> 01:20:54,170
20 grams.

1206
01:20:54,170 --> 01:21:03,979
Let's go.

1207
01:21:03,979 --> 01:21:04,779
Salt right here, right?

1208
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:06,979
20 grams.

1209
01:21:06,979 --> 01:21:16,619
What's next?

1210
01:21:16,619 --> 01:21:17,979
I need beetroot.

1211
01:21:17,979 --> 01:21:18,779
600 grams.

1212
01:21:18,779 --> 01:21:19,100
Onion.

1213
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:19,579
Beetroot.

1214
01:21:19,579 --> 01:21:20,140
I need beetroot.

1215
01:21:20,140 --> 01:21:21,020
Where's beet?

1216
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:21,500
Beetroot.

1217
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:22,779
Beetroot.

1218
01:21:22,779 --> 01:21:23,500
600 grams.

1219
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:24,539
Oh shit.

1220
01:21:24,539 --> 01:21:25,020
I need a plate.

1221
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:27,270
Hold on.

1222
01:21:27,270 --> 01:21:27,590
Just bring...

1223
01:21:30,039 --> 01:21:31,079
600 grams.

1224
01:21:31,079 --> 01:21:31,800
Put that beet in here.

1225
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:33,590
Come on.

1226
01:21:33,590 --> 01:21:34,149
Give me the beet.

1227
01:21:35,739 --> 01:21:36,220
All right.

1228
01:21:36,220 --> 01:21:37,020
600 grams.

1229
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:37,899
How many are in there right now?

1230
01:21:42,470 --> 01:21:43,109
120.

1231
01:21:43,109 --> 01:21:43,909
That's 240.

1232
01:21:44,710 --> 01:21:44,949
That's...

1233
01:21:46,390 --> 01:21:49,479
How many are in there now?

1234
01:21:49,479 --> 01:21:49,960
One...

1235
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:50,199
Two.

1236
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:51,640
40.

1237
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:52,359
Three.

1238
01:21:52,359 --> 01:21:53,399
One more.

1239
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:55,460
Done.

1240
01:21:56,020 --> 01:21:58,840
And onion too.

1241
01:21:58,840 --> 01:21:59,479
How many onions?

1242
01:22:03,239 --> 01:22:04,039
120.

1243
01:22:04,039 --> 01:22:05,079
And then 70 carat.

1244
01:22:07,449 --> 01:22:08,090
70 carat.

1245
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:10,340
70 carat.

1246
01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:10,899
One carat.

1247
01:22:12,550 --> 01:22:13,670
And then onion.

1248
01:22:17,319 --> 01:22:17,640
Beautiful.

1249
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:17,960
Parsley.

1250
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:18,279
What was it?

1251
01:22:18,279 --> 01:22:20,600
What was the parsley?

1252
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:21,000
80.

1253
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:23,699
Wait.

1254
01:22:26,260 --> 01:22:27,060
80?

1255
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:36,090
Am I insane?

1256
01:22:36,090 --> 01:22:36,729
That's a lot.

1257
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:42,779
Is there a dried parsley?

1258
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:55,579
There's no dried parsley.

1259
01:22:55,579 --> 01:23:03,000
What is it?

1260
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:03,239
How many?

1261
01:23:03,239 --> 01:23:03,880
Was this 80?

1262
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:04,439
What is this one?

1263
01:23:06,279 --> 01:23:14,149
80.

1264
01:23:14,149 --> 01:23:17,739
Okay.

1265
01:23:17,739 --> 01:23:19,739
Boil for 120 seconds.

1266
01:23:19,739 --> 01:23:22,170
That's it.

1267
01:23:22,170 --> 01:23:25,510
Let's go.

1268
01:23:25,510 --> 01:23:25,750
Timer.

1269
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:31,289
Where's the timer?

1270
01:23:31,289 --> 01:23:33,909
Q.

1271
01:23:33,909 --> 01:23:34,550
A.

1272
01:23:34,550 --> 01:23:41,369
It's got to be more like...

1273
01:23:41,369 --> 01:23:41,689
All right.

1274
01:23:41,689 --> 01:23:42,890
How much time do I have?

1275
01:23:42,890 --> 01:23:44,170
Oh, it's gonna be close.

1276
01:23:44,170 --> 01:23:54,420
That's kind of weird to do like Q-A-S-E-D.

1277
01:23:54,420 --> 01:23:54,739
All right.

1278
01:23:55,539 --> 01:23:56,500
Let's cool it down.

1279
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:58,069
No.

1280
01:23:58,069 --> 01:23:58,310
Wait.

1281
01:23:58,310 --> 01:23:58,550
What?

1282
01:23:58,550 --> 01:23:59,430
Did that just cost money?

1283
01:24:06,979 --> 01:24:08,020
I can't put it back.

1284
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:08,420
All right.

1285
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:10,420
I have it for emergency situations.

1286
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:12,069
Put it under here.

1287
01:24:12,069 --> 01:24:17,029
All right.

1288
01:24:17,029 --> 01:24:17,430
Hold on.

1289
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:26,699
What about D plate?

1290
01:24:26,699 --> 01:24:28,699
The onions are almost done

1291
01:24:28,699 --> 01:24:30,140
and then I have to turn the heat off, right?

1292
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:32,859
Do I have to grind this up?

1293
01:24:32,859 --> 01:24:37,350
Do I turn the heat off?

1294
01:24:37,350 --> 01:25:04,199
All right.

1295
01:25:04,199 --> 01:25:05,159
We're good.

1296
01:25:05,159 --> 01:25:16,920
I think I might have fucked it up.

1297
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:19,640
It's cooking for like three times the length.

1298
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:22,090
Take it off the heat.

1299
01:25:22,090 --> 01:25:22,649
No.

1300
01:25:22,649 --> 01:25:24,100
It's not done.

1301
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:31,100
Where's my plate?

1302
01:25:37,739 --> 01:25:41,510
Double heat.

1303
01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:42,069
Hurry up.

1304
01:25:42,069 --> 01:25:43,029
I'm trying.

1305
01:25:43,029 --> 01:25:45,859
All right.

1306
01:25:45,859 --> 01:25:53,399
And done.

1307
01:25:53,399 --> 01:25:54,039
I need to...

1308
01:25:54,039 --> 01:25:54,600
I need to...

1309
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:54,840
No.

1310
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:55,479
This way.

1311
01:25:55,479 --> 01:26:05,319
How much soup is soup?

1312
01:26:05,319 --> 01:26:06,439
How much soup do I need?

1313
01:26:06,439 --> 01:26:07,399
How much is it?

1314
01:26:07,399 --> 01:26:09,850
How much soup do you need?

1315
01:26:09,850 --> 01:26:10,890
300 milliliters.

1316
01:26:11,449 --> 01:26:12,569
How much time do I have?

1317
01:26:12,569 --> 01:26:12,810
20...

1318
01:26:12,810 --> 01:26:13,050
Okay.

1319
01:26:13,050 --> 01:26:14,729
I gotta dump this a little bit in the sink,

1320
01:26:14,729 --> 01:26:17,930
into the trash.

1321
01:26:17,930 --> 01:26:18,810
Oh my fucking god.

1322
01:26:18,810 --> 01:26:19,930
The whole thing came out.

1323
01:26:19,930 --> 01:26:32,810
300.

1324
01:26:32,810 --> 01:26:33,369
What?

1325
01:26:33,369 --> 01:26:34,300
Oh my god.

1326
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:39,239
I don't have time.

1327
01:26:39,239 --> 01:26:39,479
Go.

1328
01:26:50,439 --> 01:26:52,250
Too much carrot.

1329
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:53,130
Too much parsley.

1330
01:26:53,130 --> 01:26:54,010
Too much onion.

1331
01:26:54,010 --> 01:26:54,569
What?

1332
01:26:54,569 --> 01:26:56,409
I mean too much.

1333
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:00,279
It was the same.

1334
01:27:00,279 --> 01:27:03,350
It was the right amount.

1335
01:27:03,350 --> 01:27:04,550
Dude, that's hard to pour.

1336
01:27:05,989 --> 01:27:06,310
All right.

1337
01:27:06,310 --> 01:27:07,829
The food critic's gonna be here.

1338
01:27:07,829 --> 01:27:08,149
Okay.

1339
01:27:08,149 --> 01:27:09,270
Food critic is here.

1340
01:27:09,270 --> 01:27:13,350
The food critic wants tomato soup.

1341
01:27:13,350 --> 01:27:14,149
Let's get this right.

1342
01:27:14,149 --> 01:27:14,550
Okay.

1343
01:27:14,550 --> 01:27:23,699
We need that pot.

1344
01:27:23,779 --> 01:27:25,619
Just watering down the soup.

1345
01:27:25,619 --> 01:27:26,659
Is there any water?

1346
01:27:26,659 --> 01:27:27,539
You want water?

1347
01:27:27,539 --> 01:27:29,939
This is how we save money in the restaurant business.

1348
01:27:29,939 --> 01:27:31,899
Okay.

1349
01:27:31,899 --> 01:27:32,380
What do I need?

1350
01:27:34,710 --> 01:27:36,229
700 milliliters chicken broth.

1351
01:27:36,229 --> 01:27:36,470
Salt.

1352
01:27:36,470 --> 01:27:37,270
12 grams.

1353
01:27:37,270 --> 01:27:37,590
12.

1354
01:27:37,590 --> 01:27:37,909
12.

1355
01:27:38,550 --> 01:27:47,510
I need...

1356
01:27:47,510 --> 01:27:48,149
I just gotta clean.

1357
01:27:48,149 --> 01:27:48,630
Okay.

1358
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:51,930
Clean chicken broth.

1359
01:27:51,930 --> 01:27:52,890
How much is in here?

1360
01:27:52,890 --> 01:27:53,449
Not enough.

1361
01:27:53,449 --> 01:27:53,930
Throw it away.

1362
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:01,159
700.

1363
01:28:01,159 --> 01:28:01,479
What was it?

1364
01:28:01,479 --> 01:28:02,279
750?

1365
01:28:03,079 --> 01:28:03,640
700.

1366
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:03,880
12.

1367
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:04,279
12.

1368
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:04,520
6.

1369
01:28:05,159 --> 01:28:37,109
And 6 of cayenne pepper.

1370
01:28:37,109 --> 01:28:39,829
6 and then tomatoes and onions.

1371
01:28:39,829 --> 01:28:47,859
6 cayenne pepper.

1372
01:28:47,859 --> 01:28:48,100
All right.

1373
01:28:48,100 --> 01:28:48,819
We need tomatoes.

1374
01:28:48,819 --> 01:28:50,149
How many tomatoes?

1375
01:28:50,149 --> 01:28:51,909
Don't fucking run into the wall.

1376
01:28:51,909 --> 01:28:55,539
We need 960 grams of tomatoes and then one onion.

1377
01:28:55,539 --> 01:28:59,050
Let's get the onion in there.

1378
01:28:59,050 --> 01:28:59,609
Onion.

1379
01:28:59,609 --> 01:29:01,189
Did I just put a potato?

1380
01:29:01,189 --> 01:29:01,590
Okay.

1381
01:29:01,590 --> 01:29:02,149
Tomatoes.

1382
01:29:03,079 --> 01:29:03,880
So I need...

1383
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:05,100
How many tomatoes?

1384
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:06,890
8.

1385
01:29:06,890 --> 01:29:07,609
1.

1386
01:29:07,609 --> 01:29:08,329
2.

1387
01:29:08,329 --> 01:29:09,050
3.

1388
01:29:09,050 --> 01:29:09,770
4.

1389
01:29:09,770 --> 01:29:10,409
5.

1390
01:29:10,409 --> 01:29:10,970
6.

1391
01:29:10,970 --> 01:29:11,770
7.

1392
01:29:11,770 --> 01:29:12,569
8.

1393
01:29:12,569 --> 01:29:13,130
Done.

1394
01:29:13,130 --> 01:29:15,800
Get it over here.

1395
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:16,199
That's it.

1396
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:18,760
Boil for 60 seconds and blend it.

1397
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:19,640
And add sour cream.

1398
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:19,880
Boil.

1399
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:21,000
60 second blend.

1400
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,739
60 second time.

1401
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:31,369
Get the blender ready.

1402
01:29:31,369 --> 01:29:33,220
Sour cream.

1403
01:29:33,220 --> 01:29:33,779
150.

1404
01:29:35,739 --> 01:29:36,460
Not enough in there.

1405
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:36,859
Dump it.

1406
01:29:41,430 --> 01:29:42,390
150.

1407
01:29:42,390 --> 01:29:44,060
Get ready to blend.

1408
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:53,720
And then after the sour cream, we pour it in a deep plate.

1409
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:54,680
300 milliliters.

1410
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:55,319
Got it.

1411
01:29:55,319 --> 01:29:57,859
Come on.

1412
01:29:57,859 --> 01:29:58,100
Come on.

1413
01:29:58,100 --> 01:29:58,500
Hurry up.

1414
01:29:58,500 --> 01:29:59,300
Fuck up.

1415
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:14,520
Boil for 60 seconds and then blend and then turn off the heat.

1416
01:30:17,850 --> 01:30:24,100
Right?

1417
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:24,659
Go.

1418
01:30:24,659 --> 01:30:43,750
Then turn the heat off.

1419
01:30:43,750 --> 01:30:44,069
Okay.

1420
01:30:44,069 --> 01:30:46,329
Heat off.

1421
01:30:46,329 --> 01:30:50,699
Sour cream.

1422
01:30:50,699 --> 01:30:51,420
150.

1423
01:30:51,420 --> 01:31:01,909
Is it good?

1424
01:31:01,909 --> 01:31:05,430
What's dumping?

1425
01:31:05,430 --> 01:31:05,989
Deep plate.

1426
01:31:05,989 --> 01:31:12,199
Done.

1427
01:31:12,199 --> 01:31:12,920
This doesn't look cooked.

1428
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:13,640
Is it sure it's cooked?

1429
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:56,340
Okay.

1430
01:31:56,340 --> 01:31:56,739
That's fine.

1431
01:31:58,470 --> 01:31:59,029
Done.

1432
01:31:59,029 --> 01:32:03,060
Water up.

1433
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:09,109
He loved it.

1434
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:25,180
He just absolutely couldn't get enough.

1435
01:32:25,180 --> 01:32:25,819
No complaints.

1436
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:30,180
New fame level.

1437
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:31,960
New...

1438
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:32,840
Oh, we're about done.

1439
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:34,520
The day's still going on.

1440
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:34,920
Oh, okay.

1441
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:36,939
We need salmon filet.

1442
01:32:36,939 --> 01:32:37,340
Last chance.

1443
01:32:37,340 --> 01:32:38,380
This customer leaves disappointed.

1444
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:39,180
We're going to lose a star.

1445
01:32:39,180 --> 01:32:39,739
What?

1446
01:32:39,739 --> 01:32:42,680
It's salmon.

1447
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:43,800
You know, I need to like...

1448
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:44,119
Okay.

1449
01:32:44,119 --> 01:32:44,760
Salmon.

1450
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:45,319
Salt, pepper.

1451
01:32:46,630 --> 01:32:47,029
Salmon.

1452
01:32:47,029 --> 01:32:47,829
Salt, pepper.

1453
01:32:47,829 --> 01:32:54,470
Come on.

1454
01:32:54,470 --> 01:32:55,189
Salt, pepper.

1455
01:32:55,189 --> 01:32:55,750
Salt and pepper.

1456
01:32:55,750 --> 01:32:56,069
Right here.

1457
01:32:58,739 --> 01:32:59,140
Five gram.

1458
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:00,819
One, two, three, four, five.

1459
01:33:00,819 --> 01:33:10,390
Oil in the pan.

1460
01:33:10,390 --> 01:33:10,869
Oh my God.

1461
01:33:12,180 --> 01:33:13,140
Oil in the pan.

1462
01:33:13,140 --> 01:33:13,539
Add the pan.

1463
01:33:13,539 --> 01:33:14,899
Sunflower oil and salmon filet.

1464
01:33:14,899 --> 01:33:16,260
60 seconds on each side.

1465
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:16,420
Okay.

1466
01:33:16,420 --> 01:33:16,979
Oil in the pan.

1467
01:33:17,619 --> 01:33:18,100
Where's the pan?

1468
01:33:19,159 --> 01:33:20,359
I threw the pan in the fucking trash.

1469
01:33:21,510 --> 01:33:21,909
Oh my God.

1470
01:33:21,909 --> 01:33:22,470
I'm panicking.

1471
01:33:27,829 --> 01:33:28,390
Pan?

1472
01:33:28,390 --> 01:33:28,789
Pan.

1473
01:33:28,789 --> 01:33:29,270
Get a pan.

1474
01:33:30,069 --> 01:33:31,850
Sunflower oil.

1475
01:33:31,850 --> 01:33:32,329
What was it?

1476
01:33:32,329 --> 01:33:32,489
Ten?

1477
01:33:33,289 --> 01:33:36,220
Sunflower oil.

1478
01:33:36,220 --> 01:33:37,500
Ten milliliters.

1479
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:38,460
60 seconds on each side.

1480
01:33:52,359 --> 01:33:52,600
Okay.

1481
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:53,399
60 seconds on each side.

1482
01:33:54,539 --> 01:33:54,859
Timer.

1483
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:00,500
Go.

1484
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:00,819
Okay.

1485
01:34:00,819 --> 01:34:01,060
Next.

1486
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:03,720
I need boiled potatoes.

1487
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:04,199
Water.

1488
01:34:04,199 --> 01:34:05,000
A thousand.

1489
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:05,319
Water.

1490
01:34:05,319 --> 01:34:05,720
A thousand.

1491
01:34:06,279 --> 01:34:06,920
A thousand water.

1492
01:34:12,390 --> 01:34:12,630
All right.

1493
01:34:12,630 --> 01:34:13,670
I did the thing.

1494
01:34:13,670 --> 01:34:15,029
Everybody could laugh.

1495
01:34:15,029 --> 01:34:22,010
Fucking feels good when you do a perfect water.

1496
01:34:22,010 --> 01:34:22,970
A thousand.

1497
01:34:25,590 --> 01:34:26,229
Don't even look at it.

1498
01:34:26,229 --> 01:34:26,550
Let's go.

1499
01:34:27,350 --> 01:34:28,069
Salt.

1500
01:34:28,069 --> 01:34:28,390
20.

1501
01:34:28,390 --> 01:34:29,270
Potato 300.

1502
01:34:30,149 --> 01:34:30,789
Salt 20.

1503
01:34:30,789 --> 01:34:31,590
I don't have time to do that.

1504
01:34:31,590 --> 01:34:32,069
Salt 20.

1505
01:34:32,069 --> 01:34:32,789
Salt 20.

1506
01:34:32,789 --> 01:34:33,430
Where's the salt?

1507
01:34:35,539 --> 01:34:36,420
Where's the...

1508
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:37,060
Where's the flipper?

1509
01:34:37,060 --> 01:34:37,779
Where's the spatula?

1510
01:34:37,779 --> 01:34:38,420
I have to do with my hand.

1511
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:38,979
Where's the spatula?

1512
01:34:38,979 --> 01:34:39,539
Where's the spatula?

1513
01:34:39,539 --> 01:34:40,100
Where's the spatula?

1514
01:34:41,609 --> 01:34:43,050
Where's the fucking spatula?

1515
01:34:45,819 --> 01:34:46,779
Where is the spatula?

1516
01:35:03,079 --> 01:35:04,199
Oh my fucking God.

1517
01:35:04,199 --> 01:35:05,399
I do it every time.

1518
01:35:06,039 --> 01:35:07,079
What happened to the pan?

1519
01:35:09,189 --> 01:35:09,750
What?

1520
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:10,069
What?

1521
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:13,720
Where's the pan?

1522
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:15,720
Where's the pan?

1523
01:35:16,359 --> 01:35:18,359
Stop ringing at me.

1524
01:35:18,359 --> 01:35:19,159
Where's the pan?

1525
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:21,960
Come on.

1526
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:22,199
No.

1527
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:29,369
Where's the pan?

1528
01:35:30,329 --> 01:35:31,289
That's bullshit.

1529
01:35:31,289 --> 01:35:32,489
Everything was going all right.

1530
01:35:33,369 --> 01:35:34,569
Why is the pan gone?

1531
01:35:35,210 --> 01:35:37,899
Come on.

1532
01:35:37,899 --> 01:35:39,020
This is so much money.

1533
01:35:41,449 --> 01:35:43,289
That's fucking ridiculous.

1534
01:35:43,289 --> 01:35:44,090
Honest to God.

1535
01:35:44,949 --> 01:35:46,630
I can't even use this burner anymore.

1536
01:35:48,279 --> 01:35:49,239
I can't restart?

1537
01:35:51,380 --> 01:35:52,579
Oh my fucking God.

1538
01:35:56,439 --> 01:35:56,840
No.

1539
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:57,960
Pick up the salmon.

1540
01:35:59,319 --> 01:36:00,359
What are you doing?

1541
01:36:09,399 --> 01:36:11,079
People are fucking beeping at me.

1542
01:36:11,079 --> 01:36:12,119
It's fucking ruined.

1543
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:14,039
I'm so upset right now.

1544
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:20,680
What was that?

1545
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:21,000
What else?

1546
01:36:22,939 --> 01:36:24,380
Add potato salt to the water.

1547
01:36:25,989 --> 01:36:27,109
I just got screwed.

1548
01:36:27,750 --> 01:36:35,800
All right.

1549
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:36,920
Salt in the water.

1550
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:37,800
Get the potatoes in there.

1551
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:38,439
How many do I need?

1552
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:43,060
Potato.

1553
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:43,539
Potato.

1554
01:36:44,180 --> 01:36:45,140
300.

1555
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:45,939
Two potatoes.

1556
01:36:47,539 --> 01:36:48,340
Get it on there.

1557
01:36:48,340 --> 01:36:48,739
Boil.

1558
01:36:49,539 --> 01:36:50,340
How's this doing?

1559
01:36:50,340 --> 01:36:50,899
Spatula.

1560
01:36:51,699 --> 01:36:53,720
Plate.

1561
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:54,199
Where's the plate?

1562
01:36:54,840 --> 01:37:01,430
Do I not have any money to buy a plate?

1563
01:37:12,890 --> 01:37:14,569
What the fuck am I supposed to do about this?

1564
01:37:21,989 --> 01:37:44,180
Um, all right.

1565
01:37:44,180 --> 01:37:45,619
But that wasn't even my fault.

1566
01:37:45,619 --> 01:37:50,069
The thing fucking disappeared.

1567
01:37:50,069 --> 01:37:52,710
I lost my pan and now I can't get another one.

1568
01:37:52,710 --> 01:38:03,380
There's another order.

1569
01:38:03,380 --> 01:38:04,420
Yeah, but I can't even get it.

1570
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:05,939
I can't even buy a plate.

1571
01:38:05,939 --> 01:38:16,970
Just serve it in the pan.

1572
01:38:16,970 --> 01:38:18,489
Can I even do that?

1573
01:38:18,489 --> 01:38:34,710
They do that at hipster restaurants.

1574
01:38:34,710 --> 01:38:35,590
That's true.

1575
01:38:35,590 --> 01:38:43,500
Let's see if this works.

1576
01:38:46,659 --> 01:38:48,340
Why are people taking the plates home?

1577
01:38:48,340 --> 01:38:49,140
Yeah, that's weird.

1578
01:38:55,270 --> 01:38:56,069
No, I can't even.

1579
01:39:01,539 --> 01:39:03,859
Like, I need, I don't even have four cents.

1580
01:39:05,369 --> 01:39:06,250
What the fuck?

1581
01:39:06,810 --> 01:39:09,220
I have to redo today.

1582
01:39:09,220 --> 01:39:09,779
This is not fair.

1583
01:39:09,779 --> 01:39:11,300
Can I like redo the day?

1584
01:39:11,300 --> 01:39:20,920
Yeah, I'll give you a fucking restaurant.

1585
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:25,909
How does this sound?

1586
01:39:25,909 --> 01:39:27,590
Quit fucking beeping at me.

1587
01:39:27,590 --> 01:39:37,619
It's too hot to pick up.

1588
01:39:37,619 --> 01:39:37,859
All right.

1589
01:39:41,779 --> 01:39:42,739
When was this saved?

1590
01:39:52,010 --> 01:39:53,130
23 minutes ago.

1591
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:57,239
All right.

1592
01:39:57,239 --> 01:39:59,829
This time I hope the stove doesn't eat my...

1593
01:40:02,569 --> 01:40:03,930
Oh my god.

1594
01:40:03,930 --> 01:40:14,119
I have to do the whole day again.

1595
01:40:14,119 --> 01:40:15,720
Why did it eat my pan though?

1596
01:40:16,949 --> 01:40:18,949
It just deleted my fucking pan.

1597
01:40:18,949 --> 01:40:19,930
All right.

1598
01:40:19,930 --> 01:40:22,229
I'm upset about that.

1599
01:40:22,229 --> 01:40:23,829
I'm gonna get this shit ready now.

1600
01:40:23,829 --> 01:40:26,899
So I don't have to not have enough money to buy.

1601
01:40:26,899 --> 01:40:27,140
All right.

1602
01:40:27,140 --> 01:40:27,779
Here we go.

1603
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:30,279
All right.

1604
01:40:30,279 --> 01:40:36,420
Prep day.

1605
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:38,340
I did so good on that first fish too.

1606
01:40:38,340 --> 01:40:38,579
All right.

1607
01:40:38,579 --> 01:40:44,300
Let's get the spices in the right place.

1608
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:44,859
Spatula.

1609
01:40:44,859 --> 01:40:46,649
Hang it up.

1610
01:40:46,649 --> 01:40:47,619
Blender.

1611
01:40:47,619 --> 01:40:48,649
Hang it up.

1612
01:40:48,649 --> 01:40:49,609
We'll just put it right there.

1613
01:40:49,609 --> 01:40:51,779
That's fine.

1614
01:40:51,779 --> 01:40:56,439
We need fresh chicken broth.

1615
01:40:56,439 --> 01:40:57,560
We need fresh sour cream.

1616
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:03,319
We need fresh tomatoes.

1617
01:41:03,319 --> 01:41:04,039
I got the plates.

1618
01:41:05,420 --> 01:41:06,300
Is there any dirt?

1619
01:41:06,300 --> 01:41:10,060
Let's go with chicken broth.

1620
01:41:11,260 --> 01:41:12,699
Let's get it over here.

1621
01:41:15,289 --> 01:41:15,930
What if you fool?

1622
01:41:15,930 --> 01:41:16,170
What?

1623
01:41:16,729 --> 01:41:19,670
This is why I don't have any money.

1624
01:41:23,739 --> 01:41:24,460
Well, I can, I...

1625
01:41:24,460 --> 01:41:28,970
Well, it's a new day.

1626
01:41:28,970 --> 01:41:35,539
Just relax.

1627
01:41:35,539 --> 01:41:36,260
That looks good.

1628
01:41:36,819 --> 01:41:37,930
Anything else?

1629
01:41:37,930 --> 01:41:39,130
Any of those things I need to clean up?

1630
01:41:39,689 --> 01:41:40,489
I got plenty of time.

1631
01:41:47,130 --> 01:41:49,210
Just use the spilled oil.

1632
01:41:49,210 --> 01:41:49,850
Oh my god.

1633
01:41:49,850 --> 01:41:50,890
That's fucking revolting.

1634
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:54,819
All right.

1635
01:41:54,819 --> 01:41:56,659
No spills today.

1636
01:41:56,659 --> 01:41:58,180
I'm gonna be ready completely.

1637
01:41:58,180 --> 01:42:00,979
Is the oven still on?

1638
01:42:01,539 --> 01:42:04,949
This looks like shit.

1639
01:42:04,949 --> 01:42:07,909
And oven's on.

1640
01:42:07,909 --> 01:42:09,819
Turn it off.

1641
01:42:09,819 --> 01:42:11,739
I think I broke the oven by leaving it on all day.

1642
01:42:11,739 --> 01:42:12,460
So how much time I got?

1643
01:42:13,100 --> 01:42:14,390
45 seconds to get the pot.

1644
01:42:15,579 --> 01:42:16,699
Let's get the pot right here.

1645
01:42:17,979 --> 01:42:18,539
My spices.

1646
01:42:18,539 --> 01:42:19,500
Get them on the right spot.

1647
01:42:20,060 --> 01:42:22,920
This is gonna be clean today.

1648
01:42:26,329 --> 01:42:26,649
Salt.

1649
01:42:26,649 --> 01:42:27,050
Where's the...

1650
01:42:27,609 --> 01:42:28,250
There's the bowls.

1651
01:42:28,250 --> 01:42:29,130
There's plates.

1652
01:42:29,130 --> 01:42:29,770
Cutting board.

1653
01:42:30,779 --> 01:42:31,420
Nice spot.

1654
01:42:31,420 --> 01:42:31,739
All right.

1655
01:42:31,739 --> 01:42:32,699
Get it on the right area.

1656
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:36,520
Use the radio.

1657
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:36,760
All right.

1658
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:37,399
Hold on.

1659
01:42:37,399 --> 01:42:39,510
There's no time for the radio right now.

1660
01:42:39,510 --> 01:42:45,369
I got my seasonings.

1661
01:42:45,369 --> 01:42:46,010
I got my spices.

1662
01:42:46,010 --> 01:42:46,729
I got my knife.

1663
01:42:47,449 --> 01:42:50,329
I got 11 seconds to turn the radio on.

1664
01:42:52,489 --> 01:42:53,930
Now playing on cheesy FM.

1665
01:42:54,569 --> 01:42:55,770
Cooking satay.

1666
01:43:00,539 --> 01:43:00,939
All right.

1667
01:43:00,939 --> 01:43:01,340
That...

1668
01:43:01,340 --> 01:43:02,859
I told you to get classical music.

1669
01:43:02,859 --> 01:43:03,260
That's fine.

1670
01:43:04,789 --> 01:43:05,189
New order.

1671
01:43:05,189 --> 01:43:05,510
Here we go.

1672
01:43:06,390 --> 01:43:07,189
Thousand chicken broth.

1673
01:43:07,189 --> 01:43:07,590
Salt.

1674
01:43:07,590 --> 01:43:07,909
Pepper.

1675
01:43:08,470 --> 01:43:10,229
Into the pot.

1676
01:43:22,250 --> 01:43:22,729
One.

1677
01:43:22,729 --> 01:43:23,289
Two.

1678
01:43:23,289 --> 01:43:23,609
Three.

1679
01:43:24,250 --> 01:43:25,590
Almost.

1680
01:43:28,140 --> 01:43:28,619
Come on, come on.

1681
01:43:28,619 --> 01:43:29,180
Clean it up.

1682
01:43:29,180 --> 01:43:29,659
Come on.

1683
01:43:29,659 --> 01:43:30,300
A little bit more.

1684
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:30,619
Come on.

1685
01:43:30,619 --> 01:43:31,180
Clean it up.

1686
01:43:32,579 --> 01:43:33,060
That's good.

1687
01:43:33,060 --> 01:43:33,460
Perfect.

1688
01:43:33,460 --> 01:43:34,659
Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.

1689
01:43:34,659 --> 01:43:35,380
Salt, pepper, right?

1690
01:43:35,939 --> 01:43:37,029
There's my salt.

1691
01:43:37,029 --> 01:43:37,670
There's my pepper.

1692
01:43:39,670 --> 01:43:45,189
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

1693
01:43:45,829 --> 01:43:47,350
In the hall of the mountain king?

1694
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:49,960
This is the Lord of the Rings?

1695
01:43:50,520 --> 01:44:00,819
I think it was already content ID claimed because I don't hear it.

1696
01:44:00,819 --> 01:44:04,520
Yeah.

1697
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:07,880
Okay.

1698
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:08,439
What was next?

1699
01:44:09,529 --> 01:44:13,850
Next is beetroot, onion, carrot, parsley.

1700
01:44:14,569 --> 01:44:18,069
Beetroot.

1701
01:44:18,069 --> 01:44:18,550
Onion.

1702
01:44:18,550 --> 01:44:18,789
Carrot.

1703
01:44:18,789 --> 01:44:19,750
Let me get the onion.

1704
01:44:21,239 --> 01:44:21,720
Beetroot.

1705
01:44:22,359 --> 01:44:23,460
What was it?

1706
01:44:24,180 --> 01:44:24,899
Five.

1707
01:44:24,899 --> 01:44:26,020
It was five of these, right?

1708
01:44:26,020 --> 01:44:26,899
What about parsley?

1709
01:44:26,899 --> 01:44:27,859
It was one parsley.

1710
01:44:30,890 --> 01:44:31,449
Five of these.

1711
01:44:37,750 --> 01:44:40,010
And was there a carrot, too?

1712
01:44:40,890 --> 01:44:45,060
Beetroot, onion, it was one carrot.

1713
01:44:45,060 --> 01:44:46,180
No, yeah, it was one carrot.

1714
01:44:46,979 --> 01:44:55,350
Okay, here we go.

1715
01:44:58,699 --> 01:44:59,260
Boil it up.

1716
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:01,800
Boil for 120 seconds.

1717
01:45:02,439 --> 01:45:03,640
I need to blend it, too, don't I?

1718
01:45:04,279 --> 01:45:05,930
It doesn't say to blend.

1719
01:45:06,489 --> 01:45:08,840
I mean, it doesn't say blend.

1720
01:45:09,399 --> 01:45:14,600
So just boil it for 120 seconds.

1721
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:16,760
And then deep, deep plate.

1722
01:45:17,479 --> 01:45:19,060
And I'm good.

1723
01:45:27,369 --> 01:45:28,409
I haven't been counting any time.

1724
01:45:32,810 --> 01:45:33,689
How many seconds has it been?

1725
01:45:34,329 --> 01:45:40,819
Okay, let's clean up.

1726
01:45:40,819 --> 01:45:41,140
Clean up.

1727
01:45:41,140 --> 01:45:41,779
Clean up as we go.

1728
01:45:43,060 --> 01:45:44,979
Chicken broth, there's nothing in there.

1729
01:45:44,979 --> 01:45:46,619
I think I need another one of these, right?

1730
01:45:52,840 --> 01:45:54,199
Every chef will tell you clean as you go.

1731
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:00,760
Onions are cooked.

1732
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:03,189
That was less than one milliliter in there.

1733
01:46:03,189 --> 01:46:04,069
I didn't waste money.

1734
01:46:07,619 --> 01:46:10,100
Okay, the onions are cooked.

1735
01:46:10,100 --> 01:46:12,260
The parsley, everything else needs to cook.

1736
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:22,199
And then just pour it into here.

1737
01:46:28,250 --> 01:46:35,399
Onions are getting a little crunchy.

1738
01:46:38,949 --> 01:46:39,510
Okay, that's it.

1739
01:46:40,149 --> 01:46:46,310
Get it in the bowl.

1740
01:46:46,310 --> 01:46:58,520
It was 300, right?

1741
01:46:58,520 --> 01:47:00,359
Only like 40 something more.

1742
01:47:00,359 --> 01:47:01,079
Just a little bit.

1743
01:47:01,079 --> 01:47:02,039
Just a little bit.

1744
01:47:02,039 --> 01:47:02,760
That's close enough.

1745
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:04,840
I don't think I can get 10 from this.

1746
01:47:05,640 --> 01:47:08,810
Oh, whatever.

1747
01:47:08,810 --> 01:47:09,369
You get extra.

1748
01:47:11,079 --> 01:47:12,520
Happy fucking birthday.

1749
01:47:16,279 --> 01:47:20,739
That's all right.

1750
01:47:20,739 --> 01:47:21,140
Not bad.

1751
01:47:24,789 --> 01:47:27,670
Complaints were it was too much pepper.

1752
01:47:28,390 --> 01:47:29,109
Too much salt.

1753
01:47:29,829 --> 01:47:30,840
Wasn't it?

1754
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:31,960
It's too much.

1755
01:47:31,960 --> 01:47:33,079
It was 20 and 20, right?

1756
01:47:36,180 --> 01:47:36,899
All right, quiet.

1757
01:47:39,529 --> 01:47:40,489
Here comes the critic, right?

1758
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:42,779
I got everything I need.

1759
01:47:42,779 --> 01:47:43,500
I got the plate.

1760
01:47:44,220 --> 01:47:44,939
Here comes the fish.

1761
01:47:47,770 --> 01:47:49,130
Pepper, thyme, dill, trout.

1762
01:47:49,689 --> 01:47:57,640
No, wait, no.

1763
01:47:57,640 --> 01:47:58,520
Get in one of the trays.

1764
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:01,560
Get in there.

1765
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:05,079
In case somebody orders this again, just leave it on here.

1766
01:48:06,659 --> 01:48:07,699
Pepper, thyme, dill, trout.

1767
01:48:07,699 --> 01:48:08,739
Pepper, thyme, dill, trout.

1768
01:48:08,739 --> 01:48:09,460
Pepper, thyme, dill.

1769
01:48:09,460 --> 01:48:10,100
Pepper, thyme, dill.

1770
01:48:10,100 --> 01:48:10,979
Pepper, thyme, dill, dill.

1771
01:48:11,619 --> 01:48:18,390
I need one more.

1772
01:48:19,510 --> 01:48:22,010
Got it.

1773
01:48:22,010 --> 01:48:27,399
Pepper, thyme, pepper, dill.

1774
01:48:27,399 --> 01:48:28,119
Pepper, thyme, dill.

1775
01:48:28,840 --> 01:48:33,720
Come on.

1776
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:36,710
Pepper, thyme, dill, trout.

1777
01:48:36,710 --> 01:48:37,270
Pepper, thyme.

1778
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:47,399
All right.

1779
01:48:47,399 --> 01:48:47,800
That's it.

1780
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:49,079
Baking tray.

1781
01:48:49,079 --> 01:48:49,640
Put it in baking.

1782
01:48:49,640 --> 01:48:50,199
90 seconds.

1783
01:48:52,460 --> 01:48:53,500
God damn it.

1784
01:48:53,500 --> 01:48:54,859
I fucking can't believe it.

1785
01:48:54,859 --> 01:48:57,500
You can't run every fucking time.

1786
01:48:59,590 --> 01:49:00,149
90 seconds.

1787
01:49:00,789 --> 01:49:09,180
Let's do 80.

1788
01:49:09,180 --> 01:49:12,010
Let's do like just that.

1789
01:49:12,010 --> 01:49:13,130
I can come back and look.

1790
01:49:13,130 --> 01:49:17,960
Okay, they got the plate.

1791
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:19,720
Now we got the potatoes.

1792
01:49:20,359 --> 01:49:22,949
No, the lemon.

1793
01:49:22,949 --> 01:49:23,909
It's not potatoes, it's lemon.

1794
01:49:23,909 --> 01:49:24,310
Lemon, lemon.

1795
01:49:24,310 --> 01:49:25,109
One lemon quartered.

1796
01:49:25,750 --> 01:49:31,590
Here we go.

1797
01:49:32,229 --> 01:49:32,869
Freeze time.

1798
01:49:33,430 --> 01:49:37,859
Pretty good technique.

1799
01:49:37,859 --> 01:49:38,180
All right.

1800
01:49:38,180 --> 01:49:38,420
Good.

1801
01:49:38,979 --> 01:49:39,699
Wait for the fish.

1802
01:49:40,260 --> 01:49:45,380
Need a plate.

1803
01:49:45,380 --> 01:49:46,420
And then we need fresh parsley.

1804
01:49:46,420 --> 01:49:47,380
Six grams.

1805
01:49:47,380 --> 01:49:56,600
How you doing in there?

1806
01:49:56,600 --> 01:49:59,189
Pretty good.

1807
01:49:59,189 --> 01:50:01,939
Just get the parsley on it now.

1808
01:50:01,939 --> 01:50:02,579
Because who cares?

1809
01:50:09,479 --> 01:50:11,000
I swear to God.

1810
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:12,489
Fucking Burger King.

1811
01:50:13,130 --> 01:50:18,979
I don't want to run.

1812
01:50:18,979 --> 01:50:20,340
There's a perk to run faster.

1813
01:50:20,340 --> 01:50:21,460
Why the fuck would I want that?

1814
01:50:22,340 --> 01:50:24,899
Oh, right, right, right, right.

1815
01:50:27,510 --> 01:50:28,069
Is done?

1816
01:50:28,069 --> 01:50:28,470
Not yet.

1817
01:50:29,109 --> 01:50:49,699
That was horseradish.

1818
01:50:49,699 --> 01:50:52,310
Where is it?

1819
01:50:52,310 --> 01:51:00,260
It's the yellow one.

1820
01:51:00,260 --> 01:51:00,979
Five.

1821
01:51:00,979 --> 01:51:02,949
Is this five on there?

1822
01:51:02,949 --> 01:51:03,510
I didn't see it.

1823
01:51:03,510 --> 01:51:04,229
Was it five?

1824
01:51:04,229 --> 01:51:05,109
Tell me quick.

1825
01:51:05,109 --> 01:51:06,229
Was it five?

1826
01:51:06,229 --> 01:51:07,100
Was it four?

1827
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:11,159
Good.

1828
01:51:11,159 --> 01:51:19,210
Fucking parsley's on the ground.

1829
01:51:21,050 --> 01:51:22,090
All right, here you go.

1830
01:51:23,130 --> 01:51:24,170
Yummy.

1831
01:51:24,170 --> 01:51:25,609
I can't wait for you to try this.

1832
01:51:26,250 --> 01:51:29,350
I've dropped everything.

1833
01:51:29,989 --> 01:51:33,220
You can't tell the difference though.

1834
01:51:33,220 --> 01:51:33,779
Forty-eight.

1835
01:51:33,779 --> 01:51:34,739
That's better than yesterday.

1836
01:51:35,739 --> 01:51:36,539
No complaints at all.

1837
01:51:37,260 --> 01:51:41,609
All right.

1838
01:51:41,609 --> 01:51:42,250
I still have that.

1839
01:51:42,970 --> 01:51:43,460
Easy.

1840
01:51:44,180 --> 01:51:45,590
New order, huh?

1841
01:51:47,079 --> 01:51:47,800
Done.

1842
01:51:47,800 --> 01:52:11,750
I'm gonna be shocked to how fucking quick this one comes out.

1843
01:52:12,390 --> 01:52:17,270
Take it.

1844
01:52:17,270 --> 01:52:22,979
It was still hot.

1845
01:52:28,260 --> 01:52:29,140
Too much salt.

1846
01:52:29,140 --> 01:52:29,939
Did we...

1847
01:52:29,939 --> 01:52:30,819
Did I put...

1848
01:52:30,819 --> 01:52:33,539
No, I had exactly a thousand chicken broth in there.

1849
01:52:39,609 --> 01:52:40,250
Two col...

1850
01:52:40,250 --> 01:52:41,770
How many orders do I have to do here?

1851
01:52:41,770 --> 01:52:42,409
Tomato soup.

1852
01:52:42,970 --> 01:52:43,210
Fuck.

1853
01:52:43,770 --> 01:52:45,899
Okay, tomato soup is...

1854
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:49,380
Seven hundred.

1855
01:52:49,380 --> 01:52:50,020
Twelve, twelve.

1856
01:52:55,109 --> 01:52:56,630
Seven hundred, twelve, twelve.

1857
01:52:56,630 --> 01:52:57,270
Seven hundred.

1858
01:52:58,229 --> 01:52:58,789
Chicken broth.

1859
01:52:58,789 --> 01:52:59,590
Where's my chicken broth?

1860
01:52:59,590 --> 01:53:00,390
Is it still any in there?

1861
01:53:01,189 --> 01:53:01,430
No.

1862
01:53:07,189 --> 01:53:08,069
Seven hundred.

1863
01:53:08,069 --> 01:53:30,630
Come on.

1864
01:53:30,630 --> 01:53:31,829
Okay, twelve, twelve.

1865
01:53:31,829 --> 01:53:32,470
Pepper.

1866
01:53:32,470 --> 01:53:32,789
Salt.

1867
01:53:39,189 --> 01:53:39,510
Twelve.

1868
01:53:40,069 --> 01:53:40,630
Black pepper.

1869
01:53:49,619 --> 01:53:50,579
Twelve.

1870
01:53:50,579 --> 01:53:51,300
All right.

1871
01:53:51,300 --> 01:53:52,069
Here we go.

1872
01:53:52,630 --> 01:53:55,899
And we need six cayenne.

1873
01:53:55,899 --> 01:53:56,460
Tomatoes.

1874
01:53:56,460 --> 01:53:57,979
Eight tomatoes and one onion.

1875
01:53:57,979 --> 01:54:14,600
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1876
01:54:15,420 --> 01:54:16,380
And then one onion, right?

1877
01:54:16,380 --> 01:54:16,939
Was it an onion?

1878
01:54:16,939 --> 01:54:17,579
It was an onion, right?

1879
01:54:17,579 --> 01:54:18,140
It was one onion?

1880
01:54:18,140 --> 01:54:18,619
It was an onion.

1881
01:54:21,270 --> 01:54:21,430
C.

1882
01:54:21,430 --> 01:54:26,949
What do you mean C?

1883
01:54:26,949 --> 01:54:27,109
What?

1884
01:54:27,109 --> 01:54:27,670
What's the matter?

1885
01:54:28,310 --> 01:54:29,989
Is it just too big on the screen?

1886
01:54:29,989 --> 01:54:30,789
What do I do?

1887
01:54:30,789 --> 01:54:31,029
Bun?

1888
01:54:32,390 --> 01:54:33,829
Boil for sixty seconds and then blend.

1889
01:54:33,829 --> 01:54:34,390
Sixty seconds.

1890
01:54:34,390 --> 01:54:35,109
Timer.

1891
01:54:35,109 --> 01:54:35,670
Fifty seconds.

1892
01:54:41,720 --> 01:54:42,279
Then blend it.

1893
01:54:45,619 --> 01:54:46,420
Add sour cream.

1894
01:54:46,420 --> 01:54:47,300
Sour cream.

1895
01:54:47,300 --> 01:54:57,689
I'm ready.

1896
01:54:57,689 --> 01:54:58,329
We did it.

1897
01:54:58,970 --> 01:55:03,270
Hello?

1898
01:55:03,829 --> 01:55:07,609
All right.

1899
01:55:07,609 --> 01:55:08,890
I'm on a new station.

1900
01:55:08,890 --> 01:55:13,899
All right.

1901
01:55:13,899 --> 01:55:14,619
We'll keep the jazz.

1902
01:55:15,180 --> 01:55:20,340
This sounds like a song being played in reverse.

1903
01:55:26,939 --> 01:55:27,659
All right.

1904
01:55:27,659 --> 01:55:28,710
Here we go.

1905
01:55:28,710 --> 01:55:29,270
Turn this off.

1906
01:55:29,829 --> 01:55:33,909
Blend it up.

1907
01:55:33,909 --> 01:55:41,850
Done.

1908
01:55:41,850 --> 01:55:42,890
Turn off the heat.

1909
01:55:42,890 --> 01:55:45,750
Okay, done.

1910
01:55:45,750 --> 01:55:46,710
Add sour cream.

1911
01:55:46,710 --> 01:55:53,539
How much sour cream was it?

1912
01:55:53,539 --> 01:55:54,420
How much sour cream was it?

1913
01:55:54,420 --> 01:55:56,100
I just got fucking completely blanked.

1914
01:55:56,100 --> 01:55:57,609
How much sour cream?

1915
01:55:57,609 --> 01:55:59,220
One fifty.

1916
01:55:59,220 --> 01:56:02,300
How much is in there now?

1917
01:56:02,300 --> 01:56:02,779
That's enough.

1918
01:56:11,350 --> 01:56:11,909
Where's my bowl?

1919
01:56:32,180 --> 01:56:33,619
It's so hard to pour that.

1920
01:56:33,699 --> 01:56:34,579
I'm buying a ladle.

1921
01:56:38,180 --> 01:56:38,819
It's impossible.

1922
01:56:44,979 --> 01:56:45,779
Sixty-four to thirty.

1923
01:56:45,779 --> 01:56:49,220
I'm doing better than I was.

1924
01:56:49,220 --> 01:56:50,659
Not enough sour cream.

1925
01:56:50,659 --> 01:56:52,390
I thought it's too much.

1926
01:56:55,050 --> 01:56:55,529
We good?

1927
01:56:58,140 --> 01:57:01,079
Does anybody think that I'm like stuck in an infinite loop here?

1928
01:57:01,079 --> 01:57:04,420
Isn't this day two?

1929
01:57:04,420 --> 01:57:05,140
Salmon fillet.

1930
01:57:05,140 --> 01:57:07,130
Salt and pepper.

1931
01:57:07,130 --> 01:57:07,609
Save the game.

1932
01:57:26,329 --> 01:57:26,649
All right.

1933
01:57:26,649 --> 01:57:27,369
Salmon.

1934
01:57:27,369 --> 01:57:28,170
So salt and pepper.

1935
01:57:28,170 --> 01:57:29,109
Yeah.

1936
01:57:29,109 --> 01:57:30,390
I need that pan.

1937
01:57:30,390 --> 01:57:30,550
Okay.

1938
01:57:30,550 --> 01:57:31,989
This is where I fucked up last time.

1939
01:57:31,989 --> 01:57:32,630
I threw...

1940
01:57:33,909 --> 01:57:35,510
I fucked up everything from the very beginning.

1941
01:57:37,180 --> 01:57:40,140
Throwing away the pan in the very beginning was the worst thing ever.

1942
01:57:40,699 --> 01:57:42,340
Okay.

1943
01:57:42,340 --> 01:57:42,979
Pan.

1944
01:57:42,979 --> 01:57:43,300
Oil.

1945
01:57:44,659 --> 01:57:48,899
We have salmon fillet and five for both salt and pepper.

1946
01:57:49,619 --> 01:57:53,800
These are so expensive.

1947
01:58:06,340 --> 01:58:06,659
Salt.

1948
01:58:06,659 --> 01:58:07,060
Pepper.

1949
01:58:07,699 --> 01:58:11,130
Okay.

1950
01:58:11,130 --> 01:58:11,529
Get in there.

1951
01:58:12,329 --> 01:58:12,729
Three.

1952
01:58:12,729 --> 01:58:13,050
Four.

1953
01:58:13,050 --> 01:58:13,369
Five.

1954
01:58:15,430 --> 01:58:15,750
Salt.

1955
01:58:15,750 --> 01:58:16,630
Pepper.

1956
01:58:16,630 --> 01:58:17,750
And then we need to oil the pan.

1957
01:58:18,760 --> 01:58:19,479
Sunflower oil.

1958
01:58:19,479 --> 01:58:25,899
Salmon fillet.

1959
01:58:25,899 --> 01:58:27,420
Ten milliliters only.

1960
01:58:35,260 --> 01:58:35,579
All right.

1961
01:58:35,579 --> 01:58:36,220
Hold on.

1962
01:58:36,220 --> 01:58:37,260
Let's get the other thing going.

1963
01:58:37,260 --> 01:58:38,619
We need boiled potatoes.

1964
01:58:40,060 --> 01:58:40,859
Don't get rid of that.

1965
01:58:40,859 --> 01:58:41,819
There's still soup in there.

1966
01:58:42,300 --> 01:58:47,939
How did that not go in the fucking sink?

1967
01:58:47,939 --> 01:58:48,899
Fuck you, sink.

1968
01:58:49,300 --> 01:58:49,779
All right.

1969
01:58:49,779 --> 01:58:50,500
Boiled potatoes.

1970
01:58:50,500 --> 01:58:51,460
Thousand water, right?

1971
01:58:58,039 --> 01:58:58,760
Okay.

1972
01:58:58,760 --> 01:59:03,130
Twenty.

1973
01:59:03,130 --> 01:59:05,369
I have salt and then potatoes.

1974
01:59:05,369 --> 01:59:06,170
Let's get the salt in there.

1975
01:59:06,970 --> 01:59:11,159
One.

1976
01:59:11,159 --> 01:59:11,479
Two.

1977
01:59:11,479 --> 01:59:11,800
Three.

1978
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:12,119
Four.

1979
01:59:12,119 --> 01:59:12,359
Five.

1980
01:59:12,359 --> 01:59:12,600
Six.

1981
01:59:12,600 --> 01:59:12,920
Seven.

1982
01:59:12,920 --> 01:59:13,159
Eight.

1983
01:59:13,159 --> 01:59:13,399
Nine.

1984
01:59:13,399 --> 01:59:13,640
Ten.

1985
01:59:13,640 --> 01:59:13,960
Eleven.

1986
01:59:13,960 --> 01:59:14,199
Twelve.

1987
01:59:14,199 --> 01:59:14,520
Thirty.

1988
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:14,760
Forty.

1989
01:59:14,760 --> 01:59:15,000
Fifty.

1990
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:15,319
Six.

1991
01:59:15,319 --> 01:59:15,640
Seven.

1992
01:59:15,640 --> 01:59:15,880
Eight.

1993
01:59:15,880 --> 01:59:16,279
Nine.

1994
01:59:16,279 --> 01:59:16,600
Twenty.

1995
01:59:18,649 --> 01:59:19,289
All right.

1996
01:59:19,289 --> 01:59:19,850
Potatoes.

1997
01:59:19,850 --> 01:59:20,890
How many potatoes?

1998
01:59:20,890 --> 01:59:21,130
Two.

1999
01:59:21,689 --> 01:59:24,550
That's a lemon.

2000
01:59:24,550 --> 01:59:25,510
That's not a potato.

2001
01:59:27,100 --> 01:59:27,500
Boiled.

2002
01:59:28,140 --> 01:59:36,699
Here we go.

2003
01:59:36,699 --> 01:59:37,699
One.

2004
01:59:37,699 --> 01:59:38,789
Two.

2005
01:59:38,789 --> 01:59:39,029
Three.

2006
01:59:39,930 --> 01:59:40,170
Four.

2007
01:59:43,350 --> 01:59:43,590
Ten.

2008
01:59:44,310 --> 01:59:44,630
Eleven.

2009
02:00:01,850 --> 02:00:02,569
120 seconds.

2010
02:00:02,569 --> 02:00:04,090
Boiled for 120 seconds.

2011
02:00:04,090 --> 02:00:07,050
Okay.

2012
02:00:07,050 --> 02:00:08,090
Looking good.

2013
02:00:09,859 --> 02:00:11,220
Flip it with my spatula.

2014
02:00:11,220 --> 02:00:12,260
I hung it up, right?

2015
02:00:12,260 --> 02:00:12,819
I did.

2016
02:00:12,819 --> 02:00:13,060
Good.

2017
02:00:13,619 --> 02:00:14,180
Smart boy.

2018
02:00:14,899 --> 02:00:18,090
I'm gonna go for a flip.

2019
02:00:18,090 --> 02:00:18,649
Don't!

2020
02:00:18,649 --> 02:00:20,409
Every time I fuck this up.

2021
02:00:20,409 --> 02:00:21,289
I'm not gonna fuck it up.

2022
02:00:21,289 --> 02:00:22,409
I do it every single time.

2023
02:00:23,289 --> 02:00:24,170
Not this time though.

2024
02:00:24,970 --> 02:00:27,560
This is the time where I actually get it back in the pan.

2025
02:00:33,460 --> 02:00:33,859
Got it.

2026
02:00:38,699 --> 02:00:39,180
He got it.

2027
02:00:39,739 --> 02:00:42,760
Do it again.

2028
02:00:49,579 --> 02:00:49,819
All right.

2029
02:00:49,819 --> 02:00:50,300
Need a plate.

2030
02:00:50,859 --> 02:00:52,340
Here we go.

2031
02:00:55,699 --> 02:00:56,260
Serve hot.

2032
02:00:56,260 --> 02:00:56,579
That's it.

2033
02:00:56,579 --> 02:00:57,619
Just get a plate.

2034
02:00:57,619 --> 02:00:58,500
Do I have one?

2035
02:00:58,500 --> 02:00:59,460
Is a broken one over there.

2036
02:01:02,220 --> 02:01:02,859
Basic plate.

2037
02:01:05,529 --> 02:01:05,770
Okay.

2038
02:01:05,770 --> 02:01:06,489
I'm almost ready.

2039
02:01:07,050 --> 02:01:13,670
Potatoes come out.

2040
02:01:13,670 --> 02:01:14,630
This is gonna be 100.

2041
02:01:14,630 --> 02:01:15,670
It's gonna be like 120 seconds.

2042
02:01:15,670 --> 02:01:15,909
All right.

2043
02:01:15,909 --> 02:01:16,149
Here we go.

2044
02:01:16,149 --> 02:01:16,470
Here we go.

2045
02:01:16,470 --> 02:01:16,869
Almost done.

2046
02:01:17,590 --> 02:01:20,220
This is gonna be perfect.

2047
02:01:20,220 --> 02:01:33,779
It's gonna be right on time.

2048
02:01:38,390 --> 02:01:38,710
Okay.

2049
02:01:39,659 --> 02:01:39,899
One.

2050
02:01:40,779 --> 02:01:41,020
Two.

2051
02:01:41,819 --> 02:01:42,060
Three.

2052
02:01:43,100 --> 02:01:43,579
Take it out.

2053
02:01:44,300 --> 02:01:44,939
Don't drop it.

2054
02:01:52,170 --> 02:01:52,649
Oh no.

2055
02:01:53,590 --> 02:01:54,149
Is it over the...

2056
02:01:59,399 --> 02:02:00,119
Come on.

2057
02:02:00,119 --> 02:02:01,159
How do you do this?

2058
02:02:02,439 --> 02:02:02,680
All right.

2059
02:02:02,680 --> 02:02:03,720
Give her the plate.

2060
02:02:03,720 --> 02:02:04,600
Stop ringing.

2061
02:02:04,600 --> 02:02:05,720
I wish it didn't ring this much.

2062
02:02:19,670 --> 02:02:20,310
Done.

2063
02:02:20,310 --> 02:02:25,579
What did I do wrong?

2064
02:02:28,550 --> 02:02:30,310
Potatoes with too much salt.

2065
02:02:30,310 --> 02:02:33,060
Why does the recipe say 20 grams if it's too much?

2066
02:02:33,699 --> 02:02:39,960
Okay.

2067
02:02:39,960 --> 02:02:40,359
I'm done.

2068
02:02:43,100 --> 02:02:43,340
So.

2069
02:02:43,899 --> 02:02:47,239
Did I do at least four stars?

2070
02:02:47,239 --> 02:02:57,640
Okay.

2071
02:02:57,640 --> 02:02:58,680
Let's clean up.

2072
02:02:58,680 --> 02:02:59,399
I got...

2073
02:02:59,399 --> 02:02:59,720
Okay.

2074
02:02:59,720 --> 02:03:00,520
This is perfect.

2075
02:03:00,520 --> 02:03:01,239
This is amazing.

2076
02:03:01,239 --> 02:03:02,199
I got plenty of time.

2077
02:03:02,199 --> 02:03:03,159
I gotta clean this stove.

2078
02:03:03,800 --> 02:03:04,600
Clean this shit up.

2079
02:03:06,460 --> 02:03:07,020
Into the sink.

2080
02:03:08,869 --> 02:03:09,189
No.

2081
02:03:09,189 --> 02:03:17,829
Dump it in the sink.

2082
02:03:17,829 --> 02:03:18,550
All right.

2083
02:03:18,550 --> 02:03:19,750
I'm not gonna do that anymore.

2084
02:03:22,300 --> 02:03:23,180
Just get it in the sink.

2085
02:03:27,859 --> 02:03:28,500
There we go.

2086
02:03:28,500 --> 02:03:28,899
Finally.

2087
02:03:31,539 --> 02:03:34,100
I just poured it into the oven.

2088
02:03:34,100 --> 02:03:35,220
Come on.

2089
02:03:35,220 --> 02:03:37,060
Get out of the fucking way.

2090
02:03:37,060 --> 02:03:37,380
Why?

2091
02:03:38,420 --> 02:03:42,729
Why is it playing like the Godfather music?

2092
02:03:42,729 --> 02:03:44,170
Is somebody gonna come here and whack me?

2093
02:03:44,890 --> 02:03:57,189
Can I not clean this?

2094
02:03:57,750 --> 02:04:04,619
I don't think I can clean in here.

2095
02:04:05,180 --> 02:04:07,909
All right.

2096
02:04:07,909 --> 02:04:08,949
Pots are ready.

2097
02:04:08,949 --> 02:04:09,909
Hang the spatula up.

2098
02:04:13,880 --> 02:04:14,600
Sour cream.

2099
02:04:15,319 --> 02:04:16,600
There's not very much left in there.

2100
02:04:16,600 --> 02:04:17,399
There is a little bit.

2101
02:04:18,039 --> 02:04:20,140
Okay.

2102
02:04:20,140 --> 02:04:22,060
Let's get the spices back to normal.

2103
02:04:22,779 --> 02:04:25,260
Turn off the heat.

2104
02:04:25,260 --> 02:04:25,899
That would be nice.

2105
02:04:26,859 --> 02:04:27,260
Blend.

2106
02:04:27,899 --> 02:04:28,500
All right.

2107
02:04:28,500 --> 02:04:29,060
That's fine.

2108
02:04:29,539 --> 02:04:31,060
Look at how fucking dirty it is in here.

2109
02:04:31,779 --> 02:04:32,579
All right.

2110
02:04:32,579 --> 02:04:32,979
Give me the...

2111
02:04:40,939 --> 02:04:41,739
What?

2112
02:04:41,739 --> 02:04:42,539
I can't clean that?

2113
02:04:43,100 --> 02:04:47,859
Do I need to buy a new stove?

2114
02:04:53,800 --> 02:04:54,680
How much time do I got?

2115
02:04:54,680 --> 02:04:55,319
A couple minutes.

2116
02:04:56,119 --> 02:04:57,800
Let's get the cutting board in a good spot.

2117
02:04:58,439 --> 02:05:00,699
Get the knife on over here.

2118
02:05:02,579 --> 02:05:03,460
Salt and pepper.

2119
02:05:04,180 --> 02:05:04,899
Put them together.

2120
02:05:05,619 --> 02:05:08,710
The other spices can just hang out over here.

2121
02:05:10,180 --> 02:05:11,779
Everything that needs salt always needs pepper,

2122
02:05:11,779 --> 02:05:13,140
so I'm just gonna keep them right next to each other.

2123
02:05:13,699 --> 02:05:17,560
The rest of these can just hang out over here.

2124
02:05:18,199 --> 02:05:18,680
All right.

2125
02:05:18,680 --> 02:05:19,720
I'm gonna get a new recipe.

2126
02:05:22,470 --> 02:05:24,470
I'm gonna use it eventually, so just keep it over here.

2127
02:05:26,859 --> 02:05:28,619
Here's the reverse jazz...

2128
02:05:28,619 --> 02:05:29,100
Don't break.

2129
02:05:30,710 --> 02:05:31,829
The reverse jazz song.

2130
02:05:34,180 --> 02:05:35,460
I can clean that.

2131
02:05:35,460 --> 02:05:36,739
I can't clean this.

2132
02:05:36,739 --> 02:05:37,859
None of this is even dirty.

2133
02:05:38,659 --> 02:05:41,000
Okay.

2134
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:41,319
I'm good.

2135
02:05:47,399 --> 02:05:48,359
Anything else that I need to do?

2136
02:05:49,159 --> 02:05:49,880
Besides mop?

2137
02:05:52,869 --> 02:05:53,590
I'll write this.

2138
02:05:58,539 --> 02:05:58,699
Yeah.

2139
02:05:58,699 --> 02:05:59,899
The broken plate on the ground.

2140
02:06:05,399 --> 02:06:06,680
There's no broom or something.

2141
02:06:06,680 --> 02:06:07,880
I can definitely sweep, right?

2142
02:06:09,050 --> 02:06:10,090
You have to be able to sweep.

2143
02:06:17,180 --> 02:06:17,579
Yeah.

2144
02:06:17,579 --> 02:06:19,180
I'll get a stove cleaning company.

2145
02:06:28,300 --> 02:06:28,460
Here.

2146
02:06:28,460 --> 02:06:29,260
I got a better idea.

2147
02:06:41,210 --> 02:06:42,409
No, I'm not gonna throw it in the...

2148
02:06:42,409 --> 02:06:45,050
I'm just doing this so I don't have to run around.

2149
02:06:45,050 --> 02:06:48,949
Don't waste.

2150
02:06:49,590 --> 02:06:51,619
What do you...

2151
02:06:51,619 --> 02:06:52,500
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2152
02:06:53,060 --> 02:06:56,899
You want me to use already old cooked ingredients for tomorrow?

2153
02:07:08,119 --> 02:07:09,239
Is that gonna work?

2154
02:07:09,239 --> 02:07:14,409
That's how stock is made.

2155
02:07:15,670 --> 02:07:15,989
Yeah.

2156
02:07:17,350 --> 02:07:20,229
I don't think that people are gonna want to eat like an old cooked tomato.

2157
02:07:20,949 --> 02:07:22,890
All right.

2158
02:07:22,890 --> 02:07:24,170
Heat proof gloves.

2159
02:07:24,170 --> 02:07:24,890
Long reach.

2160
02:07:27,060 --> 02:07:27,779
Thermal division.

2161
02:07:28,420 --> 02:07:33,460
Connections.

2162
02:07:34,100 --> 02:07:35,539
Time slows when cutting ingredients.

2163
02:07:36,260 --> 02:07:40,489
I think I'm gonna do long arms or heat proof gloves.

2164
02:07:42,979 --> 02:07:43,539
Yeah.

2165
02:07:43,539 --> 02:07:43,779
All right.

2166
02:07:43,779 --> 02:07:45,060
So I can just pick shit up and move it around.

2167
02:07:45,699 --> 02:07:48,039
Or long hands.

2168
02:07:57,859 --> 02:07:59,380
Let's do long arms.

2169
02:07:59,380 --> 02:08:01,319
So I gave them a lot of money.

2170
02:08:01,319 --> 02:08:02,039
This is not as important.

2171
02:08:02,039 --> 02:08:02,920
Hold on.

2172
02:08:02,920 --> 02:08:04,979
Is there one I can increase the time?

2173
02:08:05,619 --> 02:08:07,449
Experience points.

2174
02:08:08,250 --> 02:08:08,890
More fame.

2175
02:08:10,090 --> 02:08:11,210
Products cost less.

2176
02:08:12,010 --> 02:08:13,449
I mean, this is important.

2177
02:08:17,449 --> 02:08:19,289
Liquids stuff costs less.

2178
02:08:20,010 --> 02:08:21,560
I'm doing it twice.

2179
02:08:22,199 --> 02:08:36,569
Demonstrate your skills.

2180
02:08:36,569 --> 02:08:36,890
All right.

2181
02:08:36,890 --> 02:08:38,569
I cleaned up a little bit so I should be good to go.

2182
02:08:39,210 --> 02:08:39,850
Repair company.

2183
02:08:41,399 --> 02:08:41,800
Quickly.

2184
02:08:43,960 --> 02:08:44,439
Hurry up.

2185
02:08:48,180 --> 02:08:48,819
13 seconds.

2186
02:08:48,819 --> 02:08:49,140
Quickly.

2187
02:08:49,140 --> 02:08:50,260
Come on, come on, come on.

2188
02:08:50,260 --> 02:08:51,609
How long is it gonna take?

2189
02:08:52,409 --> 02:08:53,050
15 seconds?

2190
02:08:53,779 --> 02:08:54,579
This is expensive.

2191
02:08:55,300 --> 02:08:55,539
Okay.

2192
02:08:55,539 --> 02:08:55,939
Fine.

2193
02:08:55,939 --> 02:08:56,340
We're good.

2194
02:09:02,140 --> 02:09:02,380
All right.

2195
02:09:02,380 --> 02:09:04,380
I got two minutes until I'm ready to go.

2196
02:09:04,380 --> 02:09:05,819
I'm getting my ingredients out.

2197
02:09:07,300 --> 02:09:11,479
I'm getting a couple of chicken broths.

2198
02:09:11,479 --> 02:09:13,000
Can I buy a recipe?

2199
02:09:18,550 --> 02:09:19,029
Not owned.

2200
02:09:19,029 --> 02:09:19,270
Okay.

2201
02:09:20,149 --> 02:09:21,590
Pork chops with baked potatoes.

2202
02:09:22,229 --> 02:09:23,689
I can do that.

2203
02:09:34,119 --> 02:09:35,159
Do more soups?

2204
02:09:35,159 --> 02:09:36,840
I don't have, I don't think I can do soups.

2205
02:09:39,529 --> 02:09:40,170
Duck broth.

2206
02:09:41,619 --> 02:09:43,140
I'm not famous enough for duck broth.

2207
02:09:43,779 --> 02:09:47,609
I can do pork chop and baked potatoes.

2208
02:09:52,710 --> 02:09:53,109
Yeah.

2209
02:09:53,109 --> 02:09:53,670
Pork chops.

2210
02:09:56,460 --> 02:09:57,579
I can't buy soups.

2211
02:10:01,979 --> 02:10:02,539
Perks.

2212
02:10:02,539 --> 02:10:03,420
Skills.

2213
02:10:03,420 --> 02:10:04,220
Everything's good to go.

2214
02:10:05,619 --> 02:10:06,340
All right.

2215
02:10:06,340 --> 02:10:07,939
So I'm gonna pre-make the soup.

2216
02:10:08,890 --> 02:10:10,010
I need to pre-make soup.

2217
02:10:10,010 --> 02:10:10,890
So let's get it out.

2218
02:10:10,890 --> 02:10:11,850
Let's get the ingredients out.

2219
02:10:12,409 --> 02:10:14,789
Just pre-make everything and then put it in the microwave.

2220
02:10:15,510 --> 02:10:15,750
All right.

2221
02:10:15,750 --> 02:10:16,149
Here's the soup.

2222
02:10:16,149 --> 02:10:16,789
I already got it right here.

2223
02:10:16,789 --> 02:10:20,010
What do I need?

2224
02:10:20,010 --> 02:10:21,210
No, this is all...

2225
02:10:21,210 --> 02:10:22,250
I need one more beet, right?

2226
02:10:26,710 --> 02:10:27,350
One more beet?

2227
02:10:29,239 --> 02:10:30,520
No, that's not gonna work.

2228
02:10:30,520 --> 02:10:34,470
Is this gonna work?

2229
02:10:39,260 --> 02:10:40,460
And then an onion, right?

2230
02:10:42,170 --> 02:10:43,210
This is not gonna work, guys.

2231
02:10:45,609 --> 02:10:46,810
No, I'm throwing this shit away.

2232
02:10:46,810 --> 02:10:52,020
Which one is the one that I just bought?

2233
02:10:52,020 --> 02:10:53,539
I'm not gonna serve customers old food.

2234
02:10:54,100 --> 02:10:58,119
That's not how it works.

2235
02:10:58,119 --> 02:11:01,829
This is the new one.

2236
02:11:01,829 --> 02:11:03,430
Gordon Ramsay would come in this restaurant

2237
02:11:03,430 --> 02:11:04,949
and start fucking trashing the place.

2238
02:11:11,239 --> 02:11:13,899
Five and then I need an onion.

2239
02:11:13,899 --> 02:11:14,859
No, what is it?

2240
02:11:14,859 --> 02:11:22,300
Carrot and then parsley, right?

2241
02:11:22,300 --> 02:11:26,300
Parsley and then what is it?

2242
02:11:26,300 --> 02:11:27,260
One onion, right?

2243
02:11:31,289 --> 02:11:32,970
And then it's chicken broth or is it water?

2244
02:11:35,500 --> 02:11:37,260
Let's get like two or three chicken broths out here.

2245
02:11:47,220 --> 02:11:48,020
And sour cream.

2246
02:11:48,579 --> 02:11:51,430
Well, not yet, not yet.

2247
02:11:51,430 --> 02:11:52,310
Don't overbuy everything.

2248
02:11:52,310 --> 02:11:53,350
All right, I got my spices.

2249
02:11:53,909 --> 02:11:55,210
I got my pre-made soup.

2250
02:11:55,210 --> 02:11:55,850
Wait, what's the other one?

2251
02:11:55,850 --> 02:11:56,729
The other one's tomato, right?

2252
02:11:56,729 --> 02:11:58,409
Let's get over here.

2253
02:11:58,409 --> 02:11:59,289
How many tomatoes is it?

2254
02:12:01,659 --> 02:12:03,579
It's one, two, eight tomatoes.

2255
02:12:07,529 --> 02:12:10,250
Eight and then it's one onion, right?

2256
02:12:12,630 --> 02:12:14,310
Eight and then an onion, I think.

2257
02:12:15,029 --> 02:12:18,260
Okay, that's good to go.

2258
02:12:18,979 --> 02:12:21,829
Now that's also chicken broth, right?

2259
02:12:21,829 --> 02:12:27,319
Here we go.

2260
02:12:27,319 --> 02:12:28,199
This is why you prep.

2261
02:12:30,949 --> 02:12:32,279
New order.

2262
02:12:32,279 --> 02:12:33,079
Fish.

2263
02:12:33,079 --> 02:12:38,069
I know this one by heart almost.

2264
02:12:38,149 --> 02:12:40,500
Where's my tray?

2265
02:12:40,500 --> 02:12:41,989
Where's my tray?

2266
02:12:41,989 --> 02:12:46,020
Where's the fucking tray?

2267
02:12:46,819 --> 02:12:47,460
Come on, man.

2268
02:12:48,100 --> 02:12:48,420
Really?

2269
02:12:51,350 --> 02:12:54,810
I prepped and everything and the tray's just not here anymore.

2270
02:12:54,810 --> 02:12:56,250
I don't own a tray anymore.

2271
02:12:56,250 --> 02:12:58,380
Are you kidding me?

2272
02:12:58,380 --> 02:13:07,750
I'm wasting fucking time already.

2273
02:13:07,750 --> 02:13:09,750
Okay, it's pepper time, dill.

2274
02:13:16,069 --> 02:13:17,189
Three, four, five.

2275
02:13:26,569 --> 02:13:29,239
Get it.

2276
02:13:29,239 --> 02:13:30,680
Pepper is right next to it, right here.

2277
02:13:32,710 --> 02:13:34,550
And then bake 90 seconds.

2278
02:13:34,550 --> 02:13:42,600
Get it in there.

2279
02:13:42,600 --> 02:13:44,199
90 seconds and then hoist.

2280
02:13:44,199 --> 02:13:44,600
Yep.

2281
02:13:44,600 --> 02:13:55,210
Don't run like you usually do.

2282
02:13:55,210 --> 02:13:56,649
What the fuck are you doing?

2283
02:13:56,970 --> 02:13:58,010
Get it in the oven.

2284
02:13:59,140 --> 02:14:09,060
91, two, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

2285
02:14:09,060 --> 02:14:11,510
I just did way too much time.

2286
02:14:16,039 --> 02:14:19,109
Okay, now we got the lemon quarter.

2287
02:14:19,109 --> 02:14:24,659
Just get it ready.

2288
02:14:24,659 --> 02:14:30,170
Freeze time.

2289
02:14:30,170 --> 02:14:30,649
Excellent.

2290
02:14:31,210 --> 02:14:33,140
Right down the middle.

2291
02:14:33,140 --> 02:14:34,180
Right down the center.

2292
02:14:34,180 --> 02:14:34,819
Perfect.

2293
02:14:34,819 --> 02:14:35,699
Not perfect, but it's okay.

2294
02:14:35,699 --> 02:14:36,260
Could be worse.

2295
02:14:36,899 --> 02:14:37,619
Plate.

2296
02:14:37,619 --> 02:14:38,899
Do I already have a plate?

2297
02:14:38,899 --> 02:14:39,939
No, I do not, Jeremy.

2298
02:14:39,939 --> 02:14:40,979
Focus, god damn it.

2299
02:14:42,229 --> 02:14:43,189
You're gonna lose everything.

2300
02:14:43,189 --> 02:14:44,229
You're gonna lose everything.

2301
02:14:48,090 --> 02:14:52,140
When that shit comes out, we got horseradish five.

2302
02:14:52,140 --> 02:14:53,420
Get it on the plate.

2303
02:14:53,420 --> 02:14:53,899
Parsley.

2304
02:14:54,380 --> 02:15:03,100
Come on.

2305
02:15:03,659 --> 02:15:30,420
You done?

2306
02:15:30,979 --> 02:15:33,560
Oh, come on.

2307
02:15:33,560 --> 02:15:35,000
Hurry up and be done.

2308
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:41,239
You're killing me.

2309
02:15:41,239 --> 02:15:42,760
One, two, three.

2310
02:15:42,760 --> 02:15:55,079
Horseradish.

2311
02:15:55,079 --> 02:15:57,079
One, two, three, four, five.

2312
02:16:03,640 --> 02:16:04,039
Easy.

2313
02:16:04,600 --> 02:16:05,239
Parsley.

2314
02:16:05,239 --> 02:16:09,909
Six.

2315
02:16:09,909 --> 02:16:10,789
Six.

2316
02:16:10,789 --> 02:16:13,020
Okay, done.

2317
02:16:13,020 --> 02:16:13,340
Enjoy.

2318
02:16:13,340 --> 02:16:15,579
Bon appetit.

2319
02:16:15,579 --> 02:16:16,220
Dick.

2320
02:16:16,220 --> 02:16:25,140
Don't be that mad.

2321
02:16:25,140 --> 02:16:26,979
And here you go, you dick.

2322
02:16:27,699 --> 02:16:31,750
All right, I'm prepped.

2323
02:16:31,750 --> 02:16:32,709
New order.

2324
02:16:32,709 --> 02:16:36,600
The Bostromish, whatever this is called.

2325
02:16:36,600 --> 02:16:37,899
All right, everything's ready.

2326
02:16:37,899 --> 02:16:38,940
Chicken broth.

2327
02:16:38,940 --> 02:16:39,420
Salt.

2328
02:16:39,420 --> 02:16:40,299
Chicken broth, salt.

2329
02:16:40,299 --> 02:16:40,700
Pepper.

2330
02:16:41,940 --> 02:16:42,659
Everything's already in there.

2331
02:16:42,659 --> 02:17:02,090
Chicken broth, salt, pepper.

2332
02:17:02,090 --> 02:17:06,790
Fucking close enough.

2333
02:17:06,790 --> 02:17:08,379
Salt and pepper.

2334
02:17:08,379 --> 02:17:19,219
20 of each.

2335
02:17:19,219 --> 02:17:21,909
20.

2336
02:17:21,909 --> 02:17:23,030
Did that actually get in there?

2337
02:17:28,149 --> 02:17:28,709
Am I crazy?

2338
02:17:28,709 --> 02:17:29,909
Did that say 10?

2339
02:17:29,909 --> 02:17:36,379
Did that not all go in?

2340
02:17:52,020 --> 02:17:52,979
Did it not all go in?

2341
02:17:52,979 --> 02:17:53,860
That was fucking weird.

2342
02:17:54,840 --> 02:17:55,879
It said 12.

2343
02:17:55,879 --> 02:17:57,079
All right, where's my pepper?

2344
02:17:57,719 --> 02:18:00,170
This is why I fucking prepped.

2345
02:18:00,170 --> 02:18:01,610
Give me my pepper, god damn it.

2346
02:18:02,329 --> 02:18:02,809
20.

2347
02:18:02,809 --> 02:18:03,450
Okay.

2348
02:18:03,450 --> 02:18:15,530
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

2349
02:18:15,530 --> 02:18:17,209
I'm understanding what's happening here.

2350
02:18:17,209 --> 02:18:18,649
I have salted.

2351
02:18:19,209 --> 02:18:21,850
I put like 20 grams of salt on one beat.

2352
02:18:23,239 --> 02:18:25,000
Oh my fucking god, whatever.

2353
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:26,040
Okay, boil the time.

2354
02:18:26,040 --> 02:18:26,920
Just boil, go.

2355
02:18:26,920 --> 02:18:34,600
I don't have time for this.

2356
02:18:34,600 --> 02:18:35,399
120 seconds.

2357
02:18:36,040 --> 02:18:37,750
Put it on.

2358
02:18:37,750 --> 02:18:40,260
On 10.

2359
02:18:40,979 --> 02:18:42,600
All right, here we go.

2360
02:18:43,079 --> 02:18:44,200
Now we just fucking hang out.

2361
02:18:44,200 --> 02:18:44,680
Who cares?

2362
02:18:47,860 --> 02:18:49,700
I didn't mix it into the broth somehow.

2363
02:18:49,700 --> 02:18:51,139
You don't stir this up.

2364
02:18:51,139 --> 02:18:53,540
I want to pick it up by the sides and just like shake it around.

2365
02:18:58,340 --> 02:19:00,920
I'm gonna blow this place up.

2366
02:19:01,559 --> 02:19:12,020
Put propane in the oven.

2367
02:19:12,020 --> 02:19:13,139
I'm not doing that yet.

2368
02:19:15,540 --> 02:19:30,420
Give me another order so I can start prepping.

2369
02:19:30,420 --> 02:19:31,860
Add 40 seconds to the timer.

2370
02:19:31,860 --> 02:19:33,299
I want to just like start breaking stuff.

2371
02:19:33,299 --> 02:19:33,459
No.

2372
02:19:34,260 --> 02:19:38,250
The onions are overcooked.

2373
02:19:39,799 --> 02:19:40,680
Not yet.

2374
02:19:40,680 --> 02:19:43,479
They will be very soon.

2375
02:19:43,479 --> 02:19:56,760
Almost done?

2376
02:19:56,760 --> 02:20:00,579
Almost done, almost done, almost done, almost done, almost done, almost done,

2377
02:20:00,899 --> 02:20:06,149
one, two, three, four, five.

2378
02:20:06,149 --> 02:20:07,670
Why are the onions so overcooked?

2379
02:20:07,670 --> 02:20:11,750
You put everything in the pot and you boil it at the same time.

2380
02:20:11,750 --> 02:20:12,309
I don't understand.

2381
02:20:13,379 --> 02:20:14,420
Take the onion out.

2382
02:20:16,500 --> 02:20:19,690
All right, off, out, into a bowl.

2383
02:20:22,100 --> 02:20:23,459
And then sayonara.

2384
02:20:23,459 --> 02:20:33,700
Just pick up the onion with your hand.

2385
02:20:33,700 --> 02:20:51,000
Am I ever gonna buy a ladle for this shit?

2386
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:51,479
Order up.

2387
02:20:52,280 --> 02:20:56,100
Italian borscht.

2388
02:20:56,100 --> 02:20:56,579
Pretty good.

2389
02:21:00,840 --> 02:21:01,559
Not enough pepper.

2390
02:21:01,559 --> 02:21:03,319
Yeah, I understand what's happening now.

2391
02:21:04,200 --> 02:21:05,850
All right, here comes the food critic.

2392
02:21:05,850 --> 02:21:06,969
Save the fucking game.

2393
02:21:06,969 --> 02:21:15,770
Here we go.

2394
02:21:15,770 --> 02:21:17,780
Oh no, I've never made this before.

2395
02:21:17,780 --> 02:21:18,579
I don't know how to do this.

2396
02:21:19,379 --> 02:21:20,500
Of course he orders the new thing.

2397
02:21:20,500 --> 02:21:22,100
I don't know how to make pork chops.

2398
02:21:23,420 --> 02:21:24,139
Okay, pork chops.

2399
02:21:24,780 --> 02:21:25,590
How many do I need?

2400
02:21:25,590 --> 02:21:25,829
Two?

2401
02:21:27,500 --> 02:21:30,739
Just one.

2402
02:21:30,739 --> 02:21:35,620
All right, and then salt the pork chop with black pepper and salt.

2403
02:21:35,620 --> 02:21:36,180
And then thyme.

2404
02:21:36,819 --> 02:21:39,129
So thyme, six grams.

2405
02:21:41,180 --> 02:21:45,719
One, six.

2406
02:21:45,719 --> 02:21:48,819
And then salt and pepper, four.

2407
02:21:54,329 --> 02:21:55,290
Evenly season it.

2408
02:21:59,540 --> 02:22:00,420
Four, nice.

2409
02:22:09,590 --> 02:22:11,430
For Minecraft food.

2410
02:22:12,549 --> 02:22:14,469
Somebody says, okay, pan.

2411
02:22:15,190 --> 02:22:16,469
Don't forget about the food critic.

2412
02:22:16,469 --> 02:22:17,510
What do you mean time's running out?

2413
02:22:17,510 --> 02:22:18,950
What the fuck are you talking about?

2414
02:22:18,950 --> 02:22:20,309
Sunflower oil, pork chops.

2415
02:22:20,309 --> 02:22:22,709
Okay, 30 milliliters of sunflower oil.

2416
02:22:22,709 --> 02:22:23,670
Sunflower oil.

2417
02:22:26,100 --> 02:22:27,540
30 milliliters of sunflower oil.

2418
02:22:32,729 --> 02:22:33,610
What do you mean mixture?

2419
02:22:35,059 --> 02:22:36,020
Is the oil already in here?

2420
02:22:38,020 --> 02:22:42,600
There's like dirty fish oil in here.

2421
02:22:44,760 --> 02:22:45,959
Hope you're not allergic.

2422
02:22:46,680 --> 02:22:49,319
All right, so we got fry for 90 seconds each side.

2423
02:22:50,299 --> 02:22:52,540
Okay, fry for, what else do we need to do?

2424
02:22:52,540 --> 02:22:54,280
And then bake potatoes.

2425
02:22:55,610 --> 02:22:56,889
And then you bake.

2426
02:22:56,889 --> 02:22:58,409
Okay, cut potato into chunks.

2427
02:22:59,129 --> 02:23:03,420
Cut potato, 300 grams of potatoes into chunks.

2428
02:23:10,360 --> 02:23:12,360
Okay, I need to say, pause it.

2429
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:16,280
I just took my hand, picked it up with my fucking hand.

2430
02:23:17,370 --> 02:23:20,569
And forcibly tried to stick it to the table.

2431
02:23:20,569 --> 02:23:25,620
Like, like I was making a, oh.

2432
02:23:28,549 --> 02:23:29,350
Oh my God.

2433
02:23:29,350 --> 02:23:30,309
All right, I need to focus.

2434
02:23:31,190 --> 02:23:32,469
300 grams of potatoes.

2435
02:23:32,469 --> 02:23:33,430
How many potatoes is that?

2436
02:23:35,030 --> 02:23:38,059
I do need a plate eventually here.

2437
02:23:38,059 --> 02:23:39,739
So 300 grams of potatoes.

2438
02:23:40,459 --> 02:23:41,930
It's two potatoes.

2439
02:23:42,649 --> 02:23:46,940
Transfer them over to here.

2440
02:23:47,739 --> 02:23:52,739
So I got to cut these into chunks of 50 grams.

2441
02:23:55,399 --> 02:23:58,520
So I need six chunks.

2442
02:24:03,059 --> 02:24:04,180
So cut them into threes.

2443
02:24:04,979 --> 02:24:35,139
Oh, chunks of 50.

2444
02:24:35,139 --> 02:24:36,579
And that's, that's, yeah, that's six.

2445
02:24:37,620 --> 02:24:38,940
I didn't do anything wrong.

2446
02:24:40,680 --> 02:24:42,680
Baking tray, bake for 80 seconds.

2447
02:24:42,680 --> 02:24:43,959
Where's the baking tray?

2448
02:24:43,959 --> 02:24:44,520
Already in there.

2449
02:24:45,079 --> 02:24:53,340
Okay, turn the oven on.

2450
02:24:57,219 --> 02:24:57,860
80 seconds.

2451
02:24:57,860 --> 02:24:58,260
Here we go.

2452
02:24:58,260 --> 02:25:00,260
Now let's just fry, fry, fry, fry, fry, fry, fry.

2453
02:25:05,700 --> 02:25:07,459
I put tomato soup in there.

2454
02:25:07,459 --> 02:25:23,829
All right, fry for 90 seconds a side.

2455
02:25:23,829 --> 02:25:24,870
Okay, good.

2456
02:25:24,870 --> 02:25:30,729
I think.

2457
02:25:30,729 --> 02:25:31,850
Okay, now anything else?

2458
02:25:31,850 --> 02:25:32,250
Anything else?

2459
02:25:34,329 --> 02:25:35,770
Just transfer them onto the plate.

2460
02:25:35,770 --> 02:25:36,329
Hot.

2461
02:25:36,329 --> 02:25:44,889
Where's my spatula?

2462
02:25:44,889 --> 02:25:50,860
I'm ready for this shit.

2463
02:25:52,059 --> 02:25:53,899
I'm a flipping master at this point.

2464
02:26:03,670 --> 02:26:04,069
Potatoes?

2465
02:26:04,069 --> 02:26:05,270
What do you mean potatoes?

2466
02:26:05,270 --> 02:26:09,190
These are fine.

2467
02:26:09,190 --> 02:26:09,989
They're fine, they're fine, they're fine.

2468
02:26:09,989 --> 02:26:11,190
Don't fucking freak me out like that.

2469
02:26:11,190 --> 02:26:12,069
Like another five seconds.

2470
02:26:12,629 --> 02:26:23,909
This was on a perfect timer.

2471
02:26:23,909 --> 02:26:29,350
They're done.

2472
02:26:29,350 --> 02:26:33,260
No, put this down.

2473
02:26:34,500 --> 02:26:35,379
Put it down.

2474
02:26:35,379 --> 02:26:36,420
Put the tray down.

2475
02:26:39,819 --> 02:26:41,579
Oh, where's my, where's my flipper?

2476
02:26:49,420 --> 02:26:50,299
What the?

2477
02:26:50,299 --> 02:27:02,969
Got it.

2478
02:27:02,969 --> 02:27:03,469
What?

2479
02:27:18,469 --> 02:27:19,989
I didn't do anything.

2480
02:27:19,989 --> 02:27:21,510
I didn't do anything.

2481
02:27:22,229 --> 02:27:23,110
It's not fair.

2482
02:27:25,340 --> 02:27:31,379
90 seconds.

2483
02:27:31,379 --> 02:27:33,139
50, 60, 70, 80.

2484
02:27:33,139 --> 02:27:34,180
I don't know.

2485
02:27:35,379 --> 02:27:39,319
Oh, I'm, I'm cooking on there.

2486
02:27:39,319 --> 02:27:40,440
I can't fucking believe it.

2487
02:27:40,440 --> 02:27:41,319
Why did that happen?

2488
02:27:42,040 --> 02:27:53,020
Motherfucker.

2489
02:27:53,020 --> 02:27:54,299
Just went through the bottom of the pan.

2490
02:27:55,770 --> 02:27:56,489
Unbelievable.

2491
02:28:14,059 --> 02:28:14,860
At least these are done.

2492
02:28:15,420 --> 02:28:20,649
Let me clean up while I go here.

2493
02:28:29,129 --> 02:28:30,649
It exploded on me.

2494
02:28:30,649 --> 02:28:31,690
That's bullshit.

2495
02:28:37,299 --> 02:28:39,620
Get it on a plate and hopefully I get four stars.

2496
02:28:39,620 --> 02:28:40,979
Hopefully it doesn't taste the glass.

2497
02:28:41,620 --> 02:28:43,799
I'm gonna be crunching on it.

2498
02:28:43,799 --> 02:28:46,040
Oh, this is good.

2499
02:28:46,040 --> 02:28:47,399
I taste a heavy iron.

2500
02:28:48,280 --> 02:28:51,299
That's a really strong iron taste.

2501
02:28:52,100 --> 02:28:52,819
It stings too.

2502
02:28:52,819 --> 02:28:53,459
Is this spices on?

2503
02:28:53,459 --> 02:28:54,899
Is this hot sauce on here?

2504
02:28:54,979 --> 02:28:56,659
My mouth is, my mouth hurts.

2505
02:29:00,819 --> 02:29:01,540
All right, let's go.

2506
02:29:33,110 --> 02:29:34,549
I see this, I don't like,

2507
02:29:34,549 --> 02:29:36,069
why can't I just like put it down?

2508
02:29:36,629 --> 02:29:37,590
I need to get the gloves.

2509
02:29:38,229 --> 02:29:47,500
Oh my fucking god.

2510
02:29:48,059 --> 02:29:49,579
I just can't put it down.

2511
02:29:55,059 --> 02:29:56,899
Why can't I just place it?

2512
02:30:02,629 --> 02:30:03,750
Oh my god.

2513
02:30:03,750 --> 02:30:16,059
I just, good enough.

2514
02:30:16,059 --> 02:30:26,889
Hope you like it.

2515
02:30:29,450 --> 02:30:33,540
Come on.

2516
02:30:33,540 --> 02:30:34,579
Not enough.

2517
02:30:34,579 --> 02:30:35,700
I lost a bunch of fame.

2518
02:30:35,700 --> 02:30:41,000
Well blame the salmon filet.

2519
02:30:41,000 --> 02:31:05,620
I'm gonna scum this.

2520
02:31:06,340 --> 02:31:08,780
Here we go.

2521
02:31:08,780 --> 02:31:20,950
How do you clean it?

2522
02:31:21,350 --> 02:31:24,309
Is it clean?

2523
02:31:32,010 --> 02:31:32,489
It's clean.

2524
02:31:35,700 --> 02:31:36,500
Nothing in here, right?

2525
02:31:38,389 --> 02:31:38,790
Here we go.

2526
02:31:38,790 --> 02:31:39,270
Now I'll get this,

2527
02:31:39,270 --> 02:31:40,069
I'll get the pan.

2528
02:31:40,069 --> 02:31:40,549
It's empty.

2529
02:31:42,469 --> 02:31:44,309
Okay, what do I do now?

2530
02:31:44,309 --> 02:31:45,270
What do I do?

2531
02:31:45,270 --> 02:31:46,229
Okay, pork chops.

2532
02:31:55,739 --> 02:31:56,940
Salt, black pepper, thyme.

2533
02:31:56,940 --> 02:31:57,260
Yep.

2534
02:32:03,379 --> 02:32:05,219
Two, three, four.

2535
02:32:05,780 --> 02:32:07,559
It's the thyme.

2536
02:32:10,069 --> 02:32:11,590
Wait, it was six thyme.

2537
02:32:17,430 --> 02:32:18,149
Six, okay.

2538
02:32:18,149 --> 02:32:20,280
Then we need pepper salt.

2539
02:32:24,100 --> 02:32:24,739
Oh fuck.

2540
02:32:25,540 --> 02:32:26,340
Turn it off, turn it off.

2541
02:32:31,690 --> 02:32:34,250
One, two, three, four.

2542
02:32:34,250 --> 02:32:34,649
Got it.

2543
02:32:39,379 --> 02:32:40,180
All right.

2544
02:32:40,180 --> 02:32:43,799
Three, four.

2545
02:32:43,799 --> 02:32:45,719
All right, got like the dinosaur dropping zone there.

2546
02:32:46,600 --> 02:32:47,159
That's it.

2547
02:32:47,159 --> 02:32:49,559
Now we add oil to the pan and pork chop.

2548
02:32:49,559 --> 02:32:50,920
Let's get the potatoes ready as well.

2549
02:32:50,920 --> 02:32:51,959
I got plenty of time.

2550
02:32:51,959 --> 02:32:54,860
It's two potatoes.

2551
02:32:57,399 --> 02:32:57,719
Stop.

2552
02:32:57,719 --> 02:32:59,319
Okay, I'm like panicking for no reason.

2553
02:33:00,520 --> 02:33:01,639
Plate, potatoes.

2554
02:33:02,280 --> 02:33:02,840
It's two.

2555
02:33:08,520 --> 02:33:11,000
Two, sunflower oil, pork chop.

2556
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,799
Potato into chunks of 50 grams.

2557
02:33:13,799 --> 02:33:14,840
And then I didn't salt them.

2558
02:33:15,860 --> 02:33:28,180
Okay, they're all getting cooked anyways.

2559
02:33:28,180 --> 02:33:28,819
Don't relax.

2560
02:33:30,409 --> 02:33:35,299
Chunks of three.

2561
02:33:40,420 --> 02:33:41,059
Don't do it like that.

2562
02:33:41,059 --> 02:33:41,860
Don't be a fucking idiot.

2563
02:33:56,899 --> 02:33:57,459
Oh shit.

2564
02:34:07,299 --> 02:34:08,340
How many did I cut?

2565
02:34:09,739 --> 02:34:11,100
How many did I cut?

2566
02:34:13,290 --> 02:34:13,690
It's okay.

2567
02:34:13,690 --> 02:34:15,290
I can cook them and it doesn't matter.

2568
02:34:15,290 --> 02:34:17,959
Salt them.

2569
02:34:17,959 --> 02:34:24,680
Six grams of salt.

2570
02:34:24,680 --> 02:34:31,299
One, two, four, five, six.

2571
02:34:32,100 --> 02:34:32,899
Come on, six.

2572
02:34:33,540 --> 02:34:34,500
Get them on the tray.

2573
02:34:49,690 --> 02:34:52,809
Is there a reason why this doesn't work half the time?

2574
02:34:53,530 --> 02:34:54,569
Get in the fucking oven.

2575
02:34:59,850 --> 02:35:00,729
What are you doing?

2576
02:35:02,620 --> 02:35:03,180
Go.

2577
02:35:03,180 --> 02:35:05,770
Heat the oil.

2578
02:35:05,770 --> 02:35:06,940
30 milliliters.

2579
02:35:18,100 --> 02:35:19,180
Heat.

2580
02:35:19,180 --> 02:35:20,059
Heat the oil.

2581
02:35:20,059 --> 02:35:20,940
Here we go.

2582
02:35:20,940 --> 02:35:22,700
I'm ready.

2583
02:35:22,700 --> 02:35:23,739
Not fucking this up again.

2584
02:35:23,739 --> 02:35:24,219
Here we go.

2585
02:35:24,219 --> 02:35:25,739
One, two, three.

2586
02:35:25,739 --> 02:35:39,209
Wait till the oil is heated.

2587
02:35:39,209 --> 02:35:56,940
90 seconds.

2588
02:35:56,940 --> 02:35:58,059
All right, whew.

2589
02:35:58,059 --> 02:36:02,899
We're good.

2590
02:36:02,899 --> 02:36:13,659
We're almost done.

2591
02:36:13,659 --> 02:36:21,110
I don't know what to do with my hands right now.

2592
02:36:21,110 --> 02:36:25,399
All right, I gotta get ready.

2593
02:36:25,399 --> 02:36:28,200
I need a place to put this shit.

2594
02:36:29,479 --> 02:36:30,680
Move this out of the way.

2595
02:36:30,680 --> 02:36:37,639
Okay, perfect.

2596
02:36:37,639 --> 02:36:38,200
Clean that up.

2597
02:36:38,760 --> 02:36:39,959
Put the tray here onto this.

2598
02:36:40,520 --> 02:36:41,239
Yep.

2599
02:36:41,239 --> 02:36:41,799
Okay, timer.

2600
02:36:41,799 --> 02:36:42,600
Looking good.

2601
02:36:42,600 --> 02:36:43,079
Spatula.

2602
02:36:43,079 --> 02:36:43,879
Where is it?

2603
02:36:43,879 --> 02:36:44,760
The oil is burning.

2604
02:36:45,659 --> 02:36:46,139
Oh fuck.

2605
02:36:47,020 --> 02:36:48,299
I thought I had to wait till oil to heat up.

2606
02:36:48,299 --> 02:36:49,340
The oil is like on fire.

2607
02:36:53,350 --> 02:36:54,309
Fuck the potatoes.

2608
02:36:58,709 --> 02:36:59,430
No.

2609
02:36:59,430 --> 02:37:03,510
I only need a few.

2610
02:37:03,510 --> 02:37:04,549
I only need six.

2611
02:37:05,190 --> 02:37:07,139
I only need six.

2612
02:37:07,860 --> 02:37:08,739
Okay, what about this?

2613
02:37:08,739 --> 02:37:09,459
This is almost done, right?

2614
02:37:11,350 --> 02:37:11,670
Flip.

2615
02:37:11,670 --> 02:37:12,469
Where's my splipper?

2616
02:37:13,430 --> 02:37:14,870
Okay, slow down.

2617
02:37:14,870 --> 02:37:15,430
Slow down.

2618
02:37:15,430 --> 02:37:16,069
Slow down.

2619
02:37:23,139 --> 02:37:23,780
Oh yeah.

2620
02:37:23,780 --> 02:37:24,180
Okay, good.

2621
02:37:24,819 --> 02:37:25,930
Shut up.

2622
02:37:26,569 --> 02:37:32,329
Good.

2623
02:37:32,329 --> 02:37:32,809
All right.

2624
02:37:32,809 --> 02:37:33,370
Potatoes.

2625
02:37:33,370 --> 02:37:34,010
I need six.

2626
02:37:34,569 --> 02:37:37,610
Which ones didn't fall on the ground?

2627
02:37:37,610 --> 02:37:41,049
One, two, three, four.

2628
02:37:42,010 --> 02:37:42,969
Five, six.

2629
02:37:43,940 --> 02:37:44,180
Good.

2630
02:37:45,459 --> 02:37:46,899
Then put the pork chop on top and we're done.

2631
02:37:50,600 --> 02:37:51,559
90 seconds aside.

2632
02:37:52,120 --> 02:38:04,819
Where's my spatula?

2633
02:38:04,819 --> 02:38:11,430
Come on.

2634
02:38:11,430 --> 02:38:12,549
It's going to go to the red in a minute.

2635
02:38:18,379 --> 02:38:19,500
No, catch it before it falls.

2636
02:38:19,500 --> 02:38:19,899
Catch it.

2637
02:38:20,540 --> 02:38:22,250
Thank god.

2638
02:38:22,250 --> 02:38:39,030
It's almost done.

2639
02:38:39,030 --> 02:38:41,739
That's getting evenly cooked, right?

2640
02:38:41,739 --> 02:38:42,219
It better be.

2641
02:38:48,700 --> 02:38:49,340
10 seconds.

2642
02:38:49,340 --> 02:38:55,450
Nine, eight, seven, six.

2643
02:38:55,450 --> 02:38:56,090
Done.

2644
02:38:56,090 --> 02:38:59,540
That is very haphazard.

2645
02:39:00,700 --> 02:39:02,219
You don't get points for presentation, right?

2646
02:39:02,219 --> 02:39:03,020
Like this doesn't matter.

2647
02:39:03,739 --> 02:39:04,520
Just eat it.

2648
02:39:04,920 --> 02:39:10,260
We got our fame points.

2649
02:39:10,979 --> 02:39:11,860
Critic is pleased.

2650
02:39:14,790 --> 02:39:16,389
There's too much salt in the potatoes.

2651
02:39:16,389 --> 02:39:18,069
Well, cry me a river.

2652
02:39:19,829 --> 02:39:25,190
Timeline has been saved.

2653
02:39:25,190 --> 02:39:25,750
Thank god.

2654
02:39:26,309 --> 02:39:26,870
All right.

2655
02:39:26,870 --> 02:39:32,870
Closing down for the night.

2656
02:39:32,870 --> 02:39:33,829
No more orders.

2657
02:39:33,829 --> 02:39:34,389
Let's clean up.

2658
02:39:34,389 --> 02:39:52,920
Um, can I just save this?

2659
02:39:52,920 --> 02:39:53,719
I have an idea.

2660
02:39:53,719 --> 02:39:54,120
Hold on.

2661
02:39:54,120 --> 02:39:57,940
Can I do this?

2662
02:39:58,819 --> 02:40:33,989
I can't like store this in the fridge.

2663
02:40:33,989 --> 02:40:34,469
Well, here.

2664
02:40:34,469 --> 02:40:38,629
Just, I fucking hate this.

2665
02:40:38,629 --> 02:40:39,590
I swear to god.

2666
02:40:39,590 --> 02:40:43,659
I can't like keep leftovers in the...

2667
02:40:43,659 --> 02:40:44,940
I just wasted money now.

2668
02:40:44,940 --> 02:40:47,260
I wanted to keep leftovers in the fridge.

2669
02:40:47,260 --> 02:40:51,260
Leftovers somewhere.

2670
02:40:51,260 --> 02:40:54,040
Now I have to clean all this shit up.

2671
02:40:54,040 --> 02:40:55,719
Yeah, this is my Academy Award.

2672
02:40:55,719 --> 02:41:08,520
Why is there a timer up here?

2673
02:41:09,979 --> 02:41:10,540
Uh, all right.

2674
02:41:10,540 --> 02:41:11,420
I need to do song.

2675
02:41:12,059 --> 02:41:16,860
Nothing on the counter needs to be cleaned, right?

2676
02:41:16,860 --> 02:41:17,739
In the mop.

2677
02:41:17,739 --> 02:41:27,700
Why can't I rotate the mop?

2678
02:41:28,790 --> 02:41:31,110
It says rotate, but you can't rotate.

2679
02:41:37,059 --> 02:41:38,340
This is how I usually clean the floor.

2680
02:41:38,340 --> 02:41:38,899
I go like this.

2681
02:41:39,620 --> 02:41:42,100
I just kind of run back and forth from side to side

2682
02:41:42,100 --> 02:41:43,379
and just hold it in a new angle.

2683
02:41:44,020 --> 02:41:47,540
Usually does a pretty good job.

2684
02:41:47,540 --> 02:41:54,760
I need to pick up the glass.

2685
02:41:55,399 --> 02:42:00,469
I wanted to prepare.

2686
02:42:01,030 --> 02:42:02,389
This is not prepping for tomorrow.

2687
02:42:02,389 --> 02:42:03,270
This is bullshit.

2688
02:42:04,729 --> 02:42:05,930
This is needing to pick up glass

2689
02:42:05,930 --> 02:42:08,569
because I'm trying to put a bowl of soup in the fucking oven.

2690
02:42:09,129 --> 02:42:13,049
I'm very upset about this.

2691
02:42:23,340 --> 02:42:25,979
All right.

2692
02:42:25,979 --> 02:42:26,379
We good?

2693
02:42:27,100 --> 02:42:27,819
I think we're good.

2694
02:42:28,379 --> 02:42:29,819
Let me just move this stuff out of the way.

2695
02:42:30,379 --> 02:42:33,979
Come here.

2696
02:42:33,979 --> 02:42:34,700
Clean the pans.

2697
02:42:35,340 --> 02:42:36,309
This is dirty.

2698
02:42:39,670 --> 02:42:41,110
Let's get hot water.

2699
02:42:41,110 --> 02:42:48,889
How do I just dump it?

2700
02:42:49,450 --> 02:42:58,090
All right, that should be clean, right?

2701
02:43:01,719 --> 02:43:02,520
Yep, clean pan.

2702
02:43:03,340 --> 02:43:04,219
Still have plenty of oil.

2703
02:43:04,219 --> 02:43:05,100
Get the oil up here.

2704
02:43:07,139 --> 02:43:09,379
This is like only one milliliter thrown away.

2705
02:43:09,379 --> 02:43:12,659
I got plenty of chicken broth.

2706
02:43:12,659 --> 02:43:13,860
I got plenty of sour cream.

2707
02:43:13,860 --> 02:43:14,659
That's just still out.

2708
02:43:14,659 --> 02:43:15,620
Can I put this in the fridge?

2709
02:43:16,500 --> 02:43:18,170
Is this rot?

2710
02:43:19,639 --> 02:43:20,520
I don't think it does, guys.

2711
02:43:20,520 --> 02:43:21,079
I think we're fine.

2712
02:43:21,719 --> 02:43:29,030
52 bucks.

2713
02:43:34,950 --> 02:43:36,309
Reached level four.

2714
02:43:36,309 --> 02:43:40,420
Okay.

2715
02:43:40,420 --> 02:43:41,860
Request reward.

2716
02:43:43,500 --> 02:43:44,540
Cheaper liquid, I think.

2717
02:43:45,340 --> 02:43:45,579
Yeah.

2718
02:43:46,219 --> 02:43:52,629
Cheaper liquid.

2719
02:43:52,629 --> 02:43:53,430
Cheaper spices.

2720
02:43:53,430 --> 02:43:53,989
Probably cheap.

2721
02:43:53,989 --> 02:43:55,190
No, cheaper liquid twice.

2722
02:43:55,750 --> 02:43:56,469
What better tips?

2723
02:43:57,110 --> 02:44:06,489
Dish taste tolerance.

2724
02:44:09,340 --> 02:44:10,219
Yeah, more tips.

2725
02:44:10,950 --> 02:44:12,229
And taste tolerance.

2726
02:44:12,790 --> 02:44:14,709
That sounds good to me.

2727
02:44:15,270 --> 02:44:15,909
Choose a recipe.

2728
02:44:15,909 --> 02:44:16,309
Here we go.

2729
02:44:16,870 --> 02:44:18,709
I already have this.

2730
02:44:23,989 --> 02:44:24,790
I already own it.

2731
02:44:25,190 --> 02:44:27,780
Pork chops with bacon.

2732
02:44:27,780 --> 02:44:28,420
I already did it.

2733
02:44:28,420 --> 02:44:29,059
I did it already.

2734
02:44:29,780 --> 02:44:40,469
130.

2735
02:44:44,819 --> 02:44:45,780
Expand menu.

2736
02:44:53,899 --> 02:44:58,139
Am I actually soft-locked right now?

2737
02:44:58,139 --> 02:45:05,670
No.

2738
02:45:05,670 --> 02:45:07,909
I have to reload before I bought this.

2739
02:45:08,629 --> 02:45:09,829
No, don't make me do that again.

2740
02:45:10,389 --> 02:45:17,750
That's like an hour and a half ago.

2741
02:45:17,750 --> 02:45:29,579
Oh, no.

2742
02:45:38,090 --> 02:45:38,409
What?

2743
02:45:39,510 --> 02:45:43,290
Open the console?

2744
02:45:43,290 --> 02:45:45,129
There is no developer console.

2745
02:45:45,129 --> 02:45:53,670
I physically can't even get out of here.

2746
02:45:53,670 --> 02:45:55,110
I have to alt F4 the game.

2747
02:46:00,600 --> 02:46:01,239
No.

2748
02:46:01,239 --> 02:46:01,959
Why?

2749
02:46:01,959 --> 02:46:02,840
Oh, come on.

2750
02:46:02,840 --> 02:46:16,629
This sucks.

2751
02:46:16,629 --> 02:46:18,149
There's really no way for me to get out of here,

2752
02:46:18,149 --> 02:46:22,899
is there?

2753
02:46:22,899 --> 02:46:23,540
No.

2754
02:46:23,540 --> 02:46:24,340
I'm stuck.

2755
02:46:25,670 --> 02:46:27,530
Well, I can just do sandbox.

2756
02:46:27,530 --> 02:46:27,930
Fuck.

2757
02:46:27,930 --> 02:46:28,889
I was having a lot of fun.

2758
02:46:36,979 --> 02:46:38,420
Yeah, I was going to go into sandbox.

2759
02:46:38,420 --> 02:46:39,059
Damn it.

2760
02:46:39,059 --> 02:46:40,579
That's frustrating.

2761
02:46:40,579 --> 02:46:41,059
Oh, well.

2762
02:46:41,700 --> 02:46:56,549
Because I bought the recipe already.

2763
02:46:56,549 --> 02:46:57,430
Just do it again.

2764
02:47:00,100 --> 02:47:06,979
What's going on now?

2765
02:47:06,979 --> 02:47:08,899
I bought the baked potato,

2766
02:47:08,899 --> 02:47:09,700
and I was going to say,

2767
02:47:09,700 --> 02:47:10,819
what the hell is happening?

2768
02:47:13,159 --> 02:47:14,120
Sandbox mode.

2769
02:47:19,319 --> 02:47:20,440
Let's try Sam.

2770
02:47:20,440 --> 02:47:21,719
What about the auto save?

2771
02:47:21,719 --> 02:47:23,799
And we have to do that whole day again.

2772
02:47:24,440 --> 02:47:25,879
What's the difference between these two?

2773
02:47:26,520 --> 02:47:28,360
Is there a difference?

2774
02:47:31,799 --> 02:47:32,920
I don't think you get recipes here.

2775
02:47:32,920 --> 02:47:34,200
I don't think you get orders.

2776
02:47:39,770 --> 02:47:40,409
Yeah, this is just...

2777
02:47:41,850 --> 02:47:42,809
There's nothing here.

2778
02:47:42,809 --> 02:47:43,770
You just destroy the kitchen.

2779
02:47:45,190 --> 02:47:46,469
You just have infinite meats.

2780
02:47:47,110 --> 02:47:48,229
There's no order.

2781
02:48:08,780 --> 02:48:10,620
I'm so sad right now.

2782
02:48:10,620 --> 02:48:15,540
I'm trying to cook the propane.

2783
02:48:15,540 --> 02:48:16,260
There we go.

2784
02:48:16,260 --> 02:48:25,530
Is this going to work?

2785
02:48:26,489 --> 02:48:28,329
Let the propane simmer.

2786
02:48:28,329 --> 02:48:34,229
Why is this not exploded?

2787
02:48:34,229 --> 02:48:37,530
Yeah, hold on here.

2788
02:48:37,530 --> 02:48:40,120
Just get a little bit of rice vinegar on here.

2789
02:48:53,530 --> 02:48:54,729
All right, looks good.

2790
02:48:54,729 --> 02:49:07,190
How about some of this oregano?

2791
02:49:07,190 --> 02:49:07,829
Sounds good.

2792
02:49:08,389 --> 02:49:16,840
How do I get this to blow up?

2793
02:49:41,299 --> 02:49:50,819
What the fuck?

2794
02:49:50,819 --> 02:50:01,100
No, get it in the oven.

2795
02:50:01,100 --> 02:50:02,379
Get a blow torch.

2796
02:50:02,379 --> 02:50:06,250
All right, give me utensils.

2797
02:50:08,659 --> 02:50:09,379
Knife.

2798
02:50:09,379 --> 02:50:11,020
Spatula.

2799
02:50:11,020 --> 02:50:12,920
Sponge.

2800
02:50:12,920 --> 02:50:14,520
Just knife and just start stabbing it?

2801
02:50:14,520 --> 02:50:15,559
Blow torch.

2802
02:50:15,559 --> 02:50:29,770
Okay, now let's...

2803
02:50:37,260 --> 02:50:38,700
Like, Jesus Christ.

2804
02:50:38,700 --> 02:50:39,979
Let's get the fuck out of me.

2805
02:50:40,459 --> 02:50:45,879
I didn't think it was going to happen.

2806
02:50:45,879 --> 02:50:52,489
This shit was on the stove for like five minutes and it didn't blow up.

2807
02:50:52,489 --> 02:50:53,290
All right, I need to...

2808
02:50:53,290 --> 02:50:54,809
I'm going to go play the game.

2809
02:50:54,809 --> 02:50:57,290
I have to reload this stupid soft lock.

2810
02:50:57,850 --> 02:51:00,870
Throw the pizzas out the window.

2811
02:51:00,870 --> 02:51:03,139
Yeah, I'm just going to microwave a bunch of fruits.

2812
02:51:06,020 --> 02:51:07,620
Microwave a pumpkin.

2813
02:51:07,620 --> 02:51:43,049
Does this happen if you put a pumpkin in the microwave?

2814
02:51:43,770 --> 02:51:49,930
Oh, it's making noises I don't like.

2815
02:51:50,649 --> 02:51:54,379
Microwave some metal.

2816
02:52:13,430 --> 02:52:14,389
All right, that's half it.

2817
02:52:14,389 --> 02:52:21,190
This is like going to like irradiate the room.

2818
02:52:21,190 --> 02:52:24,569
If you touch that right now, you would like turn to stone.

2819
02:52:24,569 --> 02:52:25,209
Can I pick it up?

2820
02:52:25,850 --> 02:52:26,809
Oh, I can.

2821
02:52:26,809 --> 02:52:49,850
There we go.

2822
02:52:49,850 --> 02:52:50,889
Why is it still working?

2823
02:52:56,440 --> 02:52:58,120
Steam is coming out of the top but...

2824
02:52:58,840 --> 02:53:16,729
Holy shit, it actually makes a fire.

2825
02:53:16,729 --> 02:53:19,899
Does the fire spread?

2826
02:53:19,899 --> 02:53:20,700
Is it like the Sims?

2827
02:53:43,270 --> 02:53:44,389
Pumpkin is black.

2828
02:53:54,840 --> 02:53:56,950
All right, what would it take for you to eat this?

2829
02:54:06,819 --> 02:54:11,780
That shouldn't be able to...

2830
02:54:11,780 --> 02:54:16,889
I need more fire.

2831
02:54:16,889 --> 02:54:22,020
I need more explosive shit.

2832
02:54:22,020 --> 02:54:26,389
No, come here.

2833
02:54:26,389 --> 02:54:27,030
Drop it right here.

2834
02:54:31,690 --> 02:54:32,250
All right, burn.

2835
02:54:32,809 --> 02:54:33,530
Fire.

2836
02:54:33,530 --> 02:54:48,709
Here we go.

2837
02:54:48,709 --> 02:54:49,829
All right, we got a fire.

2838
02:54:49,829 --> 02:54:54,379
Oh, come on.

2839
02:54:54,379 --> 02:54:55,100
Stop.

2840
02:54:55,100 --> 02:54:59,979
Come on.

2841
02:54:59,979 --> 02:55:01,180
Why can you not blow these up?

2842
02:55:08,969 --> 02:55:10,409
Can I fry-a-late it?

2843
02:55:10,409 --> 02:55:13,700
I'm gonna deep fry a propane tank.

2844
02:55:15,100 --> 02:55:16,299
That's perfectly safe.

2845
02:55:24,409 --> 02:55:25,370
There's no oil in there.

2846
02:55:25,370 --> 02:55:28,659
Oh, I'll get oil.

2847
02:55:28,659 --> 02:55:30,020
What's the worst oil in the world?

2848
02:55:37,420 --> 02:55:37,920
Huh?

2849
02:55:39,379 --> 02:55:41,780
It's got like a bomb dropped on me.

2850
02:55:46,659 --> 02:55:51,340
Lime juice, soy sauce, which what has a high olive oil?

2851
02:55:51,340 --> 02:56:06,840
Yeah.

2852
02:56:06,840 --> 02:56:08,360
Okay, everything's fine.

2853
02:56:08,360 --> 02:56:09,909
We're good to go.

2854
02:56:09,909 --> 02:56:11,430
Turn every oven on.

2855
02:56:11,430 --> 02:56:13,479
Is this what the last guy did?

2856
02:56:13,479 --> 02:56:14,440
It's still cooking.

2857
02:56:15,159 --> 02:56:23,290
Torch the place.

2858
02:56:23,290 --> 02:56:24,010
Let's go.

2859
02:56:24,010 --> 02:56:36,409
Come on, blow up.

2860
02:56:36,409 --> 02:56:37,290
What's with this fire?

2861
02:56:37,850 --> 02:56:52,360
I'm trying to like burn my eyes.

2862
02:56:53,639 --> 02:56:54,840
Turn it around this way.

2863
02:57:17,299 --> 02:57:29,290
My face in here.

2864
02:57:29,290 --> 02:57:29,850
Why is it...

2865
02:57:29,850 --> 02:57:32,010
Wait, that just exploded.

2866
02:57:32,010 --> 02:57:33,450
Why is it gas coming in?

2867
02:57:35,030 --> 02:57:38,149
I threw a cucumber and it exploded.

2868
02:57:38,149 --> 02:57:38,870
It's a grenade?

2869
02:57:41,299 --> 02:57:42,819
All right, that was fun.

2870
02:57:42,819 --> 02:57:44,899
I need to like go play the fucking game now.

2871
02:57:46,059 --> 02:57:47,819
Is that enough for me to forget what happened?

2872
02:57:49,030 --> 02:57:49,989
Where was...

2873
02:57:49,989 --> 02:57:59,899
Where did I buy the recipe?

2874
02:57:59,899 --> 02:58:01,260
The lore was just getting good.

2875
02:58:01,260 --> 02:58:02,620
Okay, I have here and here.

2876
02:58:04,340 --> 02:58:05,219
Do I not have...

2877
02:58:05,219 --> 02:58:06,180
Is quicksave broken?

2878
02:58:06,180 --> 02:58:07,299
Do I not have a save before?

2879
02:58:12,950 --> 02:58:13,510
This is the...

2880
02:58:14,790 --> 02:58:16,809
Is the autosave dead?

2881
02:58:16,809 --> 02:58:17,290
Let me check.

2882
02:58:23,159 --> 02:58:24,040
Are both dead?

2883
02:58:24,840 --> 02:58:25,639
They're not.

2884
02:58:25,639 --> 02:58:26,440
I don't think they are.

2885
02:58:31,030 --> 02:58:31,829
They're not both dead.

2886
02:58:34,840 --> 02:58:36,920
We just have to do the day before again.

2887
02:58:37,559 --> 02:58:38,760
All right, let me like go get...

2888
02:58:38,760 --> 02:58:39,719
Let me get a glass of water.

2889
02:58:40,860 --> 02:58:41,500
I'll be right back.

2890
02:58:42,139 --> 02:58:43,260
We're just gonna pretend we didn't do...

2891
02:58:47,420 --> 02:58:48,459
And make a bug report.

2892
02:58:52,040 --> 02:58:52,520
Dad, don't worry.

2893
02:58:52,520 --> 02:58:53,719
I'll mute the music for you.

2894
02:58:53,719 --> 02:58:54,280
We'll fix it.

2895
02:58:54,280 --> 02:58:54,840
All right, I'll be right back.

2896
02:58:54,840 --> 02:58:55,559
Let's get a glass of water.

2897
02:58:56,120 --> 02:58:57,700
Hopefully we can get through this quickly.

2898
02:58:58,340 --> 02:59:00,469
I'll be right back.

2899
02:59:00,469 --> 03:02:20,319
Hey.

2900
03:02:25,079 --> 03:02:26,040
All right, let's try this again.

2901
03:02:27,850 --> 03:02:32,899
As severely disappointed as I am that we have to do this third time.

2902
03:02:32,899 --> 03:02:33,940
Because this is number three.

2903
03:02:33,940 --> 03:02:35,139
This is three strikes, you're up.

2904
03:02:35,780 --> 03:02:44,100
This will be strike three coming up.

2905
03:02:49,659 --> 03:02:54,809
The first time it went through the floor, my pan, and I had to restart.

2906
03:02:54,809 --> 03:02:56,170
Second time, I got softlocked.

2907
03:02:56,170 --> 03:02:56,969

This place was exploded.

2913
03:03:07,590 --> 03:03:08,229

3147
03:54:19,639 --> 03:54:23,319
gone to like yelp and this is what's the scariest thing because anybody could just

3148
03:54:23,319 --> 03:54:28,549
write anything they want sometimes like what if you went to like a yelp review and the person

3149

3152
03:54:43,930 --> 03:54:48,969
30 people to write like 29 reviews that are all five stars and then they got like the guy

03:54:48,969 --> 03:54:53,459
that like didn't like his soup so he says that there were rats and cockroaches and stuff

3154

3155
03:55:01,000 --> 03:55:07,610
go into the restaurant and walk around the kitchen and meet all the chefs and then sit

3156
03:55:07,610 --> 03:55:12,379
there and watch them make the food for you to get the real whatever you could possibly do

3157

3661
06:16:43,930 --> 06:16:54,340

3662
06:16:54,340 --> 06:17:14,380
more soup from soups no the xp boost maybe or probably the taste did i do that all the way

3663
06:17:14,380 --> 06:17:28,490
i thought it was the diapers no the tolerance is all the way up duration of clean i need

3664
06:17:28,490 --> 06:17:50,360
more prep and i need like more after time and before time there we go you lose less fame

3667
06:18:15,380 --> 06:18:21,799

it doesn't need to be in here it happens like every 20 to 30 seconds that's my only complaint

3958
07:38:48,459 --> 07:39:21,669
is the guy driving by one minute broken ass plates everywhere my kitchen's in disarray

3959
07:39:23,770 --> 07:39:33,139
everything's just a mess i used to be a fucking three star chef and then larry came in

3960
07:39:33,139 --> 07:39:38,580

4045
08:02:08,889 --> 08:02:53,639
i start like pretending to be a child it's time to this really is a kid it's like you're gonna

4046
08:02:53,639 --> 08:03:10,169
have a party you have like 30 relatives coming over you're gonna make a bunch of food i can't

4047
08:03:10,729 --> 08:03:26,970

4049
08:03:55,189 --> 08:04:08,740
oh my god that was too that was too much so i think i'm gonna play this again i i'm not done

4050
08:04:08,740 --> 08:04:16,630
with my floor soup empire but we're gonna take a break from it because we actually might be able

4051
08:04:16,630 --> 08:04:23,909
to play it again very soon because of e3 because as of uh the microsoft conference is the next

4052
08:04:23,909 --> 08:04:34,150
time you'll see me live which is sunday sunday at uh 4 p.m eastern so 1 p.m pacific

4053
08:04:34,150 --> 08:04:44,700
so i'll be live at one o'clock maybe like 12 30 just like to but the reason why i might be able

4054
08:04:44,700 --> 08:04:49,479
to play this is because isn't there a there's like a two or three hour break between

4055
08:04:49,479 --> 08:04:56,470
microsoft and bethesda right so during that break i'll just play this and then we'll do

4056
08:04:56,470 --> 08:05:02,330
the bethesda conference that makes sense right i don't know how long it is in between

4057
08:05:06,099 --> 08:05:09,139
uh why didn't i why did i not light the kitchen on fire i did earlier

4058
08:05:12,139 --> 08:05:20,090
oh my goodness it's a four hour break that's that's perfect so the next time you'll see me

4085
08:12:27,540 --> 08:12:36,060
the 15 dollars thank you 15 bucks dropped on the floor five star meal something isn't adding

4086
08:12:36,060 --> 08:12:46,229
up right yeah but they don't know that if you drop food on the floor and it tastes the same

4087
08:12:46,950 --> 08:12:52,580
the customer isn't going to know if they do find out and they do know

4088
08:12:53,380 --> 08:12:59,619
the whole place shuts off forever so that's why and the customer doesn't have a window

4089
08:12:59,619 --> 08:13:04,020
that's why i like open kitchen concepts in restaurants because you can see if the

4090
08:13:04,020 --> 08:13:09,779
guy blows his nose into your food you know if you hear like a big cough and you look up

4105
08:15:26,250 --> 08:15:39,209
dollars and fifty cents have you ever had hers cheddar horseradish chips i've not are they good

4106
08:15:41,180 --> 08:15:45,020
i'll buy them the next time at the grocery store are they available because that sounds

4107
08:15:45,020 --> 08:15:55,750
pretty good i love horseradish i like it on sushi because that's what you're putting on

4108
08:15:55,750 --> 08:16:01,860
your sushi essentially most of the wasabi that you put on sushi is actually just

4109
08:16:01,860 --> 08:16:05,220
green horseradish i just ruined i blew you mind right there didn't i

4110
08:16:13,189 --> 08:16:26,659
yeah not really no it is real wasabi is yeah it's pretty rare they have it in some places

4111
08:16:27,220 --> 08:16:45,419
if you eat sushi at 7-eleven no what that's a thing but i didn't serve sushi at 7-eleven

4112
08:16:45,419 --> 08:16:55,319
that's against the law at this point you can't legally have sushi at 7-eleven they still do

4113
08:16:57,110 --> 08:17:05,720
no no they don't has anyone ever bought sushi from 7-eleven and if you have why

4114
08:17:05,799 --> 08:17:08,919
there had to have been a reason you were dared by it you got it you lost a bet

4115
08:17:10,380 --> 08:17:18,659
everyone that buys sushi from 7-eleven lost a bet previously that's how they make all their money

4116
08:17:19,459 --> 08:17:47,369
is on lost bets i have i was hungry i was still hungry after puking oh that's too bad i'm i'm

4117
08:17:47,369 --> 08:17:54,729
of the opinion though i might sound a little elitist here but unless i see the person making

4118
08:17:54,729 --> 08:18:01,220
the sushi unless i order the sushi and they do it right now right there i'm not gonna eat it who

4119
08:18:01,220 --> 08:18:04,419
knows somebody could have like stuck another tag on it add like the grocery store there's a

4120
08:18:04,419 --> 08:18:10,740
grocery store sushi all right maybe but if it's just sitting in a box hey here's some salmon

4121
08:18:10,740 --> 08:18:14,869
sushi how long has it been there for has it been on the fucking ground in a bowl for more

4122
08:18:14,869 --> 08:18:21,220
than four days i know somebody that's done that personally very much so i know them very well

4123
08:18:21,779 --> 08:18:26,389
who knows how long they could have been in there yes they have standards

4124
08:18:27,270 --> 08:18:31,189
but i want to see the person i want to order it and have it done and given to me in like less than

4125
08:18:31,189 --> 08:18:46,340
an hour raw food i don't mess around with raw food i eat sushi i like i really like sushi

4126
08:18:46,979 --> 08:18:52,759
but i don't mess around with raw food steak tartar i will don't i won't even touch it i

4127
08:18:52,759 --> 08:18:58,040
won't even be in the same room if you have steak tartar in a room and you invite me over

4128
08:18:58,040 --> 08:19:02,119
it's i'm gonna be like a vampire i'm not gonna be able to go in the room it's gonna

4129
08:19:02,119 --> 08:19:20,099
be like a satan going into a church like i like skin will start to burn but yeah sushi's great

4130
08:19:20,819 --> 08:19:32,979
i wonder what my favorite sushi roll is anybody know can somebody guess have i ever said it on

4131
08:19:32,979 --> 08:19:43,259
stream i don't think i have it's not california roll no you got it somebody got it i have two

4132
08:19:43,259 --> 08:19:51,400
or three favorite rolls philadelphia roll is in my top three spicy tuna is probably number one

4133
08:19:52,970 --> 08:20:05,080
and number three is uh debatable it's out there somewhere but spicy tuna is my favorite

4134
08:20:05,959 --> 08:20:18,889
especially if they do spicy tuna with like avocado on it it's so good but yeah with flakes

4135
08:20:18,889 --> 08:20:26,330
tempura flakes now you just make me want to get a spicy tuna roll uh there's a sushi

4136
08:20:26,330 --> 08:20:33,700
called philadelphia roll yes philadelphia roll is raw salmon and cream cheese rolled up with

4137
08:20:33,700 --> 08:20:41,619
um but usually what cucumber in it too now people that are going whoa that's gross um

4138
08:20:42,819 --> 08:20:47,860
you know bagel locks you never had like cream cheese locks and bagels before

4139
08:20:48,500 --> 08:20:59,419
it's kind of the same idea you never had a bagel with locks and cream cheese on it

4140
08:20:59,419 --> 08:21:07,130
that's fantastic too if you have never had it smoked salmon cream cheese yeah that's

4141
08:21:07,130 --> 08:21:11,049
it's the same idea it's just the it's a sushi roll and the salmon is raw

4142
08:21:16,549 --> 08:21:21,189
in other words the fish in spicy tuna isn't regulated quality and cut tuna doesn't have to

4143
08:21:21,189 --> 08:21:41,340
fall into an fda quality control because it's a minced meat mixed in sauce uh what yeah but when

4144
08:21:41,340 --> 08:21:48,729
i go to like nice sushi places that you can kind of you can like see them making it they don't

4145
08:21:48,729 --> 08:21:57,779
do they don't like scoop it up like an ice cream scoop usually i usually eat it it's a

4146
08:21:57,779 --> 08:22:05,939
sham i've actually been to a place before that had sushi and they the spicy tuna was

4147
08:22:05,939 --> 08:22:13,380
scooped up with an ice cream scoop and i immediately was like i'm gonna eat that but

4148
08:22:13,380 --> 08:22:23,939
i'm not gonna come back i still ate it and it was fine now you think now that you say that i

4149
08:22:24,500 --> 08:22:39,779
yeah they do a lot of ice cream scoop spicy tuna interesting i'm not even like ever again

4150
08:22:42,709 --> 08:22:54,869
except from the places that i know do it right i do like like uh simply this tuna sashimi

4151
08:22:55,669 --> 08:23:02,790
the nice dark almost purple fatty tuna it's really good with wasabi on it and that stuff's

4152
08:23:02,869 --> 08:23:18,299
real because i mean it is that doesn't come out of an ice cream scoop you see the guy like

4174
08:26:13,500 --> 08:26:18,540
you were a pirate captain and i was a member of your crew we were looking for the infinity

4175
08:26:18,540 --> 08:26:25,020
stones and we had followed a map to this one specific island i immediately found all six under

4176
08:26:25,020 --> 08:26:34,169
a rock brought them to you and asked you to put me in the rumble you got super mad and

4177
08:26:34,169 --> 08:26:52,069
then i woke up thanks for the infinity stones can i be in the rumble the hardest decisions

4178
08:26:52,630 --> 08:27:03,220
takes the strongest of all decisions and then i fucking push you also seriously wendy's

4179
08:27:03,220 --> 08:27:06,259
mcdonald's and burger king aren't you forgetting one taco themed restaurant taco

4180
08:27:06,259 --> 08:27:13,770

4181
08:27:13,849 --> 08:27:27,500
actual burgers we're talking about mcdonald's wendy's and burger king all these other places

4182
08:27:27,500 --> 08:27:34,220

4185
08:27:50,099 --> 08:28:03,029
get like what that's weird examine that in the mirror later was it like a fucking leech on me

4186
08:28:03,029 --> 08:28:10,069
earlier that's weird it's confusing anyways a taco bell is not a burger restaurant it is a taco

4187
08:28:10,069 --> 08:28:13,750
restaurant therefore it is compared with other taco restaurants which there are not very many

4188
08:28:13,750 --> 08:28:20,389
fast food taco places there are some but i digress and they say put me in the rumble

4248
08:36:45,340 --> 08:36:53,080
it went well i the doctor doesn't have any major concerns they took a few biopsies which

4249
08:36:53,080 --> 08:37:01,959
is why i spent an extra day or so away from the stream and just kind of wanted to reassure

4250
08:37:01,959 --> 08:37:08,659
myself a few things so the biopsies will come back in a couple weeks and again he doesn't

4251
08:37:08,659 --> 08:37:13,990
have any major concerns but it's always nice to know the results of those but yeah it went

4252
08:37:13,990 --> 08:37:25,049
well where was i the youngest person in the clinic um not not not that i don't really remember i

4253
08:37:25,049 --> 08:37:29,770
wasn't really paying that much attention to other people i was kind of just remember i hadn't really

4254
08:37:29,770 --> 08:37:37,959
eaten solid food in almost two days so i didn't really care who was in the clinic i was just

4255
08:37:37,959 --> 08:37:44,790
wanted to get it over with it was more about just focus and get in there and let me get out

4256
08:37:44,790 --> 08:37:54,709
of here and be done but no it went well uh a couple more bits are came in here a little

4257

bit earlier we had uh ragarnoi for the two dollars and i fucked that up you cook your

4258
08:38:04,020 --> 08:38:13,139

4259
08:38:13,139 --> 08:38:28,729
worth reading that was good thank you for the bits there uh short stack thanks for five

4260
08:38:28,810 --> 08:38:32,729

08:38:48,520 --> 08:38:55,259
you for the five dollars uh unicorn butt crumbs thanks for two dollars and fifty cents hey

4264
08:38:55,259 --> 08:39:00,380
jeremy been watching you for about seven years now since the early days of youtube you never

4265
08:39:00,380 --> 08:39:06,619
fail to put a smile on my face buddy i've been struggling a lot with uh ssri withdrawals

4266
08:39:06,619 --> 08:39:11,340
and your streams are a nice escape from my crazily imbalanced brain love all your content

4267
08:39:11,340 --> 08:39:17,020
creating and passion for what you do got a question for you okay which fictional character

4268
08:39:17,020 --> 08:39:22,919
has had the biggest impact on your life fictional character that has had the biggest

4269
08:39:22,919 --> 08:39:48,740
impact in my life um honestly probably probably ren and stimpy if i'm completely and totally

4270
08:39:48,740 --> 08:39:55,909
honest because that like shaped everything about like the way that i wanted to think was funny

4271
08:39:55,909 --> 08:40:05,450
and the way that i was and imitation and ran and stimpy both those two would just characters

4272
08:40:05,450 --> 08:40:19,380
that you only get to pick one ren is ren is definitely not stimpy it's ren always ran

4273
08:40:19,380 --> 08:40:34,840
stimpy is cool but ren was the clear clear anchor of the whole show uh ren was the little

4274
08:40:34,840 --> 08:40:42,970
chihuahua i mean i guess a better i mean you say fictional character but billy west is not

4275
08:40:42,970 --> 08:40:48,330
a fictional character that's the person that did all the voices for ren stimpy doug he did

4276
08:40:48,330 --> 08:40:53,130
almost every voice on futurama billy west is probably like the reason why i'm the kind of

4277
08:40:53,130 --> 08:41:01,319
person that i am billy west jim carrey um a couple other probably cartoon actors probably

4278
08:41:01,880 --> 08:41:07,689
but yeah billy west was doing all a majority of those characters when i was growing up

4279
08:41:08,250 --> 08:41:14,970
and he was so good and he was he was so interesting the way that he would put stuff

4280
08:41:14,970 --> 08:41:18,650
together in the way that he would talk and how we would roll sentences together it was

4281
08:41:18,650 --> 08:41:26,380
it was fascinating and probably uh charlie adler too if you want to know who charlie

4282
08:41:26,380 --> 08:41:35,990
adler is um ed big head uh the satan from cow and chicken uh ikus from ah real monsters

4283
08:41:38,549 --> 08:41:43,750
just so talented just could do anything with his voice it was just he could go up he could go

4284
08:41:43,750 --> 08:41:57,369
down he was so good yeah like the ass devil guy yeah yeah i think he had an actual name

4285
08:41:57,369 --> 08:42:14,220
was he just devil but there you go i did a kind of a wordy answer there but i'm really

4286
08:42:14,220 --> 08:42:22,740
sorry to hear about your having withdrawals here and if i can be something fun or something

4287
08:42:22,740 --> 08:42:31,750
interesting that you can relax to or have fun with i say it a lot but it's that's great

4288
08:42:31,750 --> 08:42:36,389
for me that's great for this community that means a lot to me that's like that's great

4289
08:42:36,389 --> 08:42:41,479
for me to hear that because i would never want somebody to come and watch this channel and then

4290
08:42:41,479 --> 08:42:46,790
say that's this is not good this was that i didn't like that this made me like

4291
08:42:46,790 --> 08:42:50,310
uncomfortable this made me feel like shit i don't want you to like feel like shit after

4292
08:42:50,310 --> 08:42:58,950
the stream i don't want you to leave this stream like mad or upset or angry or not having fun you

4293
08:42:58,950 --> 08:43:04,580
know what i'm saying i don't want you to feel bad so knowing that if you feel people tell

4294
08:43:04,580 --> 08:43:12,040
me that they feel good that's a win for me like i feel great hearing that it wins not really

4295
08:43:12,040 --> 08:43:30,470
the right word but i mean maybe it is floor soup was uncomfortable yeah and i know like

4296
08:43:30,470 --> 08:43:36,200
honestly like we fuck around a lot on these streams but it's to a point where we're

4297
08:43:37,139 --> 08:43:46,009
it you know what i mean that i can't really put it into words the floor soup made me

4298
08:43:46,009 --> 08:43:57,060
uneasy yeah but you didn't leave you still here floor soup was pissing me off it was

4299
08:43:58,180 --> 08:44:06,810
hey it's just soup on the floor it's a clean floor it doesn't where else was i going to put

4300
08:44:06,810 --> 08:44:17,270
it i almost screwed hey i'm having a moment here okay i'm having a little moment here i'm

4301
08:44:17,270 --> 08:44:33,740
trying to like tell you and i care about you sport anyways that's gonna be it i will see you guys

4302
08:44:34,540 --> 08:44:40,470
for the microsoft conference i'll probably be live 20-ish minutes before the conference so i can

4303
08:44:40,470 --> 08:44:45,700
get set up and we can hang out and remember last time i did this i was like 10 minutes late and

4304
08:44:45,700 --> 08:44:49,779
i was like in a bathrobe with wet hair from the shower i'm gonna try to avoid that this

4305
08:44:49,779 --> 08:45:16,139
time that is sunday let's see e3 microsoft so that it's at 4 p.m eastern so let me let me

4306
08:45:16,139 --> 08:45:21,020
get a good look here i'm not doing the ea play live i feel like that's not gonna be anything

4307
08:45:21,020 --> 08:45:30,619
worth covering microsoft is sunday at 4 p.m eastern so 1 p.m pacific so like 12 30 pacific

4308
08:45:30,619 --> 08:45:36,299
on sunday is when the stream is probably i'd say between like 12 and 1 p.m pacific and stream

4309
08:45:36,299 --> 08:45:44,979
will turn on and then bethesda is four hours later so depending how long the microsoft

4310
08:45:44,979 --> 08:45:55,450
conference goes we'll play uh kitchen flipper for a couple hours or so and then there's also

4311
08:45:55,450 --> 08:45:59,830
i probably probably won't do devolver because i probably at that point would have been

4312
08:45:59,830 --> 08:46:09,720
streaming for almost 10 hours so i'll probably take off after the bethesda conference four five

4313
08:46:09,720 --> 08:46:12,840
six seven eight nine ten no actually never mind i'm reading this wrong it'd be like

4314
08:46:12,840 --> 08:46:21,909
maybe not we'll see how it goes because that would only be six hours or so so yeah we'll

4315
08:46:21,909 --> 08:46:27,830
