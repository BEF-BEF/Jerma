00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:19,300
How are you? Welcome back to Virtual Reality with Jeremy985. We're going to begin today

2
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:27,510
with Space Channel 5. Sorry I wasn't here yesterday. I think I severely underestimated how much pain I

3
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:34,310
was going to be in yesterday. I woke up and I turned till I get out of bed. It was like

4
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:41,189
that's the best way to describe pain. Especially turning pain. Those of you guys that have like

5
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:51,429
rotational pain. That's a perfect noise for it. It sucks. But I'm good. I'm here. I'm not. Oh my

6
00:00:51,429 --> 00:00:58,549
God. I just fucking fell over. These cords. I swear to God. I'm not even on camera and I almost

7
00:00:58,549 --> 00:01:05,560
just fell down. I didn't even do anything. I'm not taking the brace off today. Don't let me do that.

8
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,760
It doesn't matter how much of a sweaty bastard I am. Don't let me take this thing off.

9
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:14,420
It is doing something very important. It's over it's it's I'm wearing I'm doing a Doug

10
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:20,409
Funny right now. I'm wearing it over my clothes. Doug Funny used to wear his underwear over his

11
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:29,239
clothes as that superhero uh Quailman. So just think of it like that. Health a healing curse?

12
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:38,260
If it works then do it. You don't kill it can we collectively? I'm serious. Let's do this. I'm

13
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:42,500
gonna get on camera. We're gonna collectively fucking have like like a healing session.

14
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:50,819
Can we do that? If you have to imagine if like five to ten thousand people all collectively

15
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:55,780
think the same thing at the same time will that work? Like the neurons and like the weird

16
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,700
simulation that we're probably living in like will like the data get processed and like will

17
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:08,490
my like pain go away tomorrow? Let's try it. Give me the healing. What's the curse part though?

18
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:13,270
Hold on a second. Let me just get my never ending supply of fucking White Claw.

19
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:27,699
How's it gonna be? Well yeah I'm doing it today. Just a little. This is how you summon what? No

20
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:32,340
dude don't call it a healing curse. Call it like a a healing potion and we have to go over some

21
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,060
things too because there are people that think I'm like four feet tall. This is really important.

22
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:48,419
We have to okay I'm just gonna put the cam on. See I moved the camera a little bit because

23
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:56,069
can you hear me? I hope you can. All right first of all I got the fucking championship belt on.

24
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:02,680
Just I didn't texture it yet. I feel like a fucking videographer. This is just giving me

25
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:08,680
flashbacks. Okay yeah get the big get the groom get the groom. All right so listen to me this is

26
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:18,069
important. This this is not a window okay. I that I hung it's a blanket I hung on the wall

27
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:22,310
because it's so echoey in here. I had to put up something to absorb the sound.

28
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:35,500
Understand that's not a window. Second of all this base station is six three. This is I measured it.

29
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:43,319
It's six foot three. Do you see that? It's like six fucking four. I don't know why everything looks

30
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:54,969
so tiny on this camera in this room. Like look ready I I look like fucking minuscule. I don't

31
00:03:54,969 --> 00:04:02,280
know why. You know what it looks like? Have you ever seen those um okay you know those optical

32
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,560
illusions where it's like the huge guy is standing here and there's like a tiny little person in the

33
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,120
corner and it's just like oh wow oh my god this is and they're in a room and the furniture looks

34
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:18,860
all weird. Like it's because the room is like 50 feet long and it's like slanted. That's what's

35
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:24,870
going on here because look it no I'm normal person but when I go back here I don't know why.

36
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:35,910
But I don't understand it looks so bizarre or whatever. That's not a window. I'm five eight. Get

37
00:04:35,910 --> 00:05:03,259
over it. I wanted that to be so loud. You got a short neck? I don't have a short neck. That's such a

38
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:12,360
fucking insult. I don't know why. You know oh hey you're a fat guy. Oh you're stupid. Your neck is

39
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:23,180
too short. That fuck that like hurts. I don't know what to say. You got anything to say? You got

52
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:58,810
connected? What are you talking about? Did I take too long? It might be too loud. We'll find out.

53
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:09,240
Oh there you are. Acid sneeze. Say happy birthday to Catboy. Happy birthday Catboy.

Oh Ulala. First off we'll need to get you scanned so you can come inside.

00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,179
Place your hands out in front. Why is this?

00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:12,580
Oh my god I'm a huge fan. Memorize your partner's moves and then dance them right back.

Hey. Hey. Jaguars. Be careful. Be careful.

Hey. Oh shit.

00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:08,150
Don't you know. My name is. Who's that. Hey. I'm done. Well. What about me.

143
00:34:28,679 --> 00:35:08,820
Got it. We got to save. We ready. All right. Rush him.

144
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:21,619
Oh. 100. When it comes to dancing.

145
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:33,510
Wait. This is the villain redemption arc here. Have it back. You can have it back. Take it back.

146
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:39,989
I'm my redemption arc. Take it back. Here. I don't want to go to hell. Just take it. This.

147
00:35:39,989 --> 00:35:45,590
This gets me into heaven. My god redeems. Right. Come on. Take it. I want to go. I want to get to

148
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:57,320
heaven.

149
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:20,650
What. Why are we shooting there. This is kind of weird.

150
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:54,789
What the fuck. All right. Watch out. What's that called. Oh.

151
00:36:54,869 --> 00:37:10,420
Shut up. Why was I not paying attention. What. My arms are too fucked up.

152
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:56,179
Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Whatever. Did I get it.

153
00:37:56,659 --> 00:38:41,849
Literally. No. Oh my god. Jesus. Wait. Can I stand here. I think I did a lot of work.

154
00:38:42,570 --> 00:39:06,789
I'm almost missed that one. What the fuck. Don't touch me. Hey. What was that. Well I don't want

155
00:39:06,789 --> 00:39:21,219
to turn. I want to. I don't know what they're doing. You didn't let me choreograph this with

156
00:39:21,219 --> 00:40:00,730
me. I wasn't here at the rehearsal. Oh. Whatever. I'm tired. I'm done. I'm done. I'm going to walk

157
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:42,219
off the stage. That was fun. It's your moment. That's it. I guess so. That was pretty cool.

158
00:40:46,920 --> 00:41:27,429
How long did that take. Forty minutes. Wait. Wait. Wait. Dance. Putting. Was that a drug

159
00:41:27,429 --> 00:41:37,239
handoff. Thanks for the coke. Put that in here and then we continue to move like we were supposed

160
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:55,079
to be here. You're an enemy. Oh. Sorry. We just got shocked. It's like. Oh. Sorry. Are you okay.

161
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:58,519
Yeah. I got me too. Did you see the blue line. Did you see the blue line. Oh my god. I was

162
00:41:58,519 --> 00:42:23,219
fucking crazy. It's like a Marvel post credit scene. And here we are with celebrity death match.

163
00:42:23,219 --> 00:42:40,949
I'm here. It's Tom Green versus Jim Carrey. That's the same guy. Same guy. All right. So

164
00:42:40,949 --> 00:42:54,920
coming up next. We are going to play. Wait. I want to give her a high five. That was cute.

165
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:09,110
We're going to play Sniper Elite VR next. Well, we will hope for peace in the universe. Thank

166
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:20,889
you for playing the game. Sega Grounding Incorporate. Oh shit. Hold on. What. That was my big.

167
00:43:22,059 --> 00:43:34,980
That was my big moment and I failed it. How did I suppose. What. I got 175 percent. All right.

168
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:42,019
Let's move on to Sniper Elite VR. I'm going to get some water. I was looking forward to that.

169
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:46,519
I played all the other ones. But hold on a second here. Hold on. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

170
00:43:47,239 --> 00:44:08,860
Arcade dressing room. Hold on a minute. Do I get any clothes. I kind of want to be the alien.

171
00:44:09,739 --> 00:44:29,929
All right. I want to be this guy. Arcade. I'm curious. I think this is just the game. Right.

172
00:44:31,449 --> 00:44:43,659
Miku's far out report show. Excuse me. Excuse me. Um. Wait a minute. Hold on a minute. We're not

173
00:44:43,659 --> 00:44:50,489
skipping. Do you guys know that I thought that Miku was a real person. I didn't know that it was a

174
00:44:50,489 --> 00:44:56,409
vocal whatever robot. I thought it was like an actual like singer. I didn't think it was a vocal.

175
00:44:56,409 --> 00:45:01,909
Whatever there. I until like six months ago I thought like Miku was just was like a singer.

176
00:45:02,469 --> 00:45:11,289
This is going to be hard to do. I'm going to try. Hopefully this is not too loud for you.

177
00:45:11,929 --> 00:45:41,210
Do I spill it. I don't think so. No. I don't think so. But I've heard some of Miku's songs.

178
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:53,050
Who's Miku. How old are you. I don't know. She's real to me. Space drink. Alcohol. There are no laws

179
00:45:53,050 --> 00:46:00,280
where you're drinking. It's not. I can't. I'm drinking a fucking White Claw in a VR environment

180
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:14,139
in my own space. I'm telling you guys this helps. So two days ago where I almost puked from the

181
00:46:14,139 --> 00:46:19,820
dinosaur game. That's not going to happen today. All right. Should I be key or Rue.

182
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:44,230
I'm excited for this. Miku's far out report. I thought she was like eight feet tall. What.

183
00:46:44,789 --> 00:46:50,489
I thought she was like seven seven or something. I thought she was huge. Who the fuck is that.

184
00:47:03,989 --> 00:47:24,579
Okay. Did I say that. Okay. Are we ready. Here come the aliens. Time to dance.

185
00:47:25,300 --> 00:48:33,739
Who's this little weird guy. Good. Okay. Let's go. Not the cat. I don't want to be the cat.

186
00:48:49,210 --> 00:49:02,010
Rescue successful. This is where I got to. Excuse me. Miku. Miku. Can I get a selfie real quick Miku.

187
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:28,119
I'm sorry. I'm just a huge fan. Oops. Hey did the viewers go up because Miku is here now.

188
00:49:40,650 --> 00:50:06,900
Did they literally. Yes. Oops. Shit. It's only halfway through. Holy shit.

189
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:40,949
Oh that's another successful rescue. Be careful. Oh hard mode.

190
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:58,039
Rue bought prime. Where are the guns. Where are the guns. Where's the shooting. I know.

191
00:50:58,039 --> 00:51:18,150
Just give me a minute. I can fucking move still even with a pain condition. You'll never take

192
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:45,670
that from me. You'll never get it from me. Stop making sounds for no reason. Oh I don't want to

193
00:51:45,670 --> 00:52:29,420
do that. No. Whatever. 89. That's all right. This game makes. What. This game makes light of war.

194
00:52:30,059 --> 00:52:40,170
What are you talking about. Oh this game makes light of war. Let's finish this together.

195
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:53,380
What did you think Miku. Did you like what I did. Did you like me. Did you like what I did.

196
00:52:54,489 --> 00:52:59,289
Oh just do it. Do it normally. Oh yeah. Bye.

197
00:53:01,849 --> 00:53:24,059
See you later. Good wave. I think that's all to see. We got to do this. Do it all.

198
00:53:24,059 --> 00:53:31,769
I'm not going to open this game ever again. I mean like that's actually like not.

199
00:53:31,769 --> 00:53:35,880
I'm never going to open this game ever again. So much. We'll do the stuff that's here.

200
00:53:43,769 --> 00:53:58,090
A hundred stage dance battle. Holy shit. I'm ready for this. You're going to be dead after this game.

201
00:53:58,090 --> 00:54:08,199
I'm alive. I'm alive. I'm a human. My blood is ready pumps. I like to fuck too. What does he say.

202
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:35,690
Is that me. Oh no.

203
00:55:02,019 --> 00:55:04,099
Stage 11. Let's go.

204
00:55:35,349 --> 00:55:57,320
What. That was right. All right. We're moving on. What the fuck is happening.

205
00:55:58,599 --> 00:56:01,079
I'm winning. That's what's happening.

206
00:56:01,079 --> 00:57:00,630
I keep saying that.

207
00:57:00,789 --> 00:57:05,769
fucking OBS. It's showing me like 10 seconds ago. It's freaking me out.

208
00:57:05,769 --> 00:57:37,099
Woof. That thing. That thing. That thing. I gotta do it. Meow. Woof. Meow. Up. Meow. Left. Meow.

209
00:57:37,099 --> 00:57:48,610
Right. I didn't tell me they're gonna go faster than that.

210
00:57:48,610 --> 00:58:20,630
Genuine Phil. What? Oh, Honda. That was fucking perfect. Honda. Honda. Woof. Honda.

211
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:51,989
Honda. Honda. That's so fucked up. I'm in a coma. I'm in a coma and I'm trying to

212
00:58:51,989 --> 00:58:57,280
get out of the coma. I feel like I'm lying in a bed right now and my

213
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,400
face is kind of twitching a little bit. Like I'm gonna wake up soon if I do this.

214
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:28,929
Toyota. Toyota. Toyota. Toyota. Honda. Toyota. Woof. Honda. Woof. Meow. Fuck. I got it.

215
00:59:28,929 --> 01:00:04,190
Oh God. You were in a car accident? No. I can't. Toyota. Honda. Toyota. Honda. Honda. I was like struck by a car.

216
01:00:04,389 --> 01:00:26,309
Oh no. I can't. I can't. I can't. Oh.

217
01:00:26,309 --> 01:00:31,199
Macho.

218
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:59,079
When does this end? I'm gonna beat this whole thing.

219
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:06,519
Jaguar. Jaguar.

220
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:24,510
Oh shit. Jaguar. Macho.

221
01:01:32,769 --> 01:01:36,389
Car thing. I can't.

222
01:01:52,210 --> 01:02:06,300
I'm almost there. I'm seriously almost there.

223
01:02:08,570 --> 01:02:44,130
Meh. Meh. Jaguar. Meh. Hey. Oh, I'm getting a pulse. I can hear him. I hear like the nup, nup, nup. Come on, Jeremy. You can do it.

224
01:02:44,130 --> 01:03:00,500
I'm coming. That's too many. It's the gorilla driving the car. That's just the movies.

225
01:03:06,809 --> 01:03:23,019
Gorilla book. Gorilla reading book.

226
01:03:54,860 --> 01:04:27,619
Pose. Just do it all. Shit. Pose. Pose. Pose. Pose. Pose. Pose. Jaguar. Did I do it? Holy shit, I did it.

227
01:04:28,179 --> 01:04:36,150
I just sat out of the bed. It was the gorilla reading a book. He was driving a Jaguar.

228
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:44,030
It's like, Mr. Elbertson, you had hernia surgery. Are you okay? You've been here for like a few days.

229
01:04:44,030 --> 01:05:02,250
Alright, I think that's good. That was fun. Wait, did you see how many calories you burned? 180 calories. Wow.

230
01:05:02,250 --> 01:05:12,869
Alright, that was cool. I'm gonna drink some water. We're gonna do Sniper Elite VR. Talking to you.

231
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:25,590
Only 180 calories? Yeah, that's not that much. Do the roar. Oh, what was wrong with Boneworks? Alright, hold on.

232
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:34,019
I figured it out. So, Boneworks was a game that came out way before Alyx.

233
01:05:34,019 --> 01:05:40,380
And I remember it was like, wow, a game that's actually utilizing the knuckle controllers.

234
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:46,380
And it's like, oh, look at the physics and shit. I played Alyx before I played Boneworks.

235
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:53,380
Isn't that kind of an issue, right? Like, Alyx is one of my favorite games ever.

236
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:57,380
It was my game of the year last year. It's the best VR game I've ever played.

237
01:05:57,380 --> 01:06:03,380
So, I didn't play Boneworks before Alyx. Therefore, it was kind of a stepping stone to get to Alyx in a way, right?

238
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:14,019
I think that's why I found it a little underwhelming. At least me personally, right? Fuck you.

239
01:06:14,579 --> 01:06:22,139
Hey, listen. I didn't say that. I don't think Boneworks is a bad game. It just didn't grab me.

240
01:06:22,139 --> 01:06:26,570
That's it. It's probably fucking really good. The physics are fucking awesome.

241
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:30,570
It was really fun. The gun shooting seemed fun. The stuff having weight, that was cool.

242
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:35,699
It just didn't grab me. And that's okay. That's okay.

243
01:06:35,699 --> 01:06:41,539
I don't think it's a bad game. I never said that.

244
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:55,500
I think me playing Alyx first set expectations in a weird way. I don't know why.

245
01:06:55,559 --> 01:07:02,679
It was made to be innovative, not to be a good game. Well, I mean, it was, right?

246
01:07:02,679 --> 01:07:09,280
I remember watching the dev videos. I don't think it's a bad game. Stop putting words in my mouth.

247
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:15,280
All right, Sniper Elite VR. If one of the mods could change it to Sniper Elite VR, that would be fantastic.

248
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:30,239
Go ahead and hold on. Can I not select it from here? Come on, dude. What the hell?

249
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:36,920
Oh, really? I don't have to. Oh, shit. I can't select it. Wait. Oh, my God. I'm using this.

250
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:45,539
All right, Sniper Elite VR. Where are you? There it is. All right, let's do it.

251
01:07:45,539 --> 01:08:06,730
Pick up that can. You look like a gnome. Your opinion doesn't matter.

252
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:13,780
Oh, that's interesting. You know, the gnomes are like part of the reason why the Alliance was able to get to the fucking place that they were.

253
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:18,539
You understand the amount of cookies that you ate from those Keebler elves, those little gnomes?

254
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:25,439
Fuck the gnomes, right? You understand how important they were?

255
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:35,100
They protect your fucking garden, bro. Don't ever speak of that again. Alliance.

256
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:39,850
All right, so this is Sniper Elite VR. I think this is probably fine.

257
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:46,829
Subtitles probably on. I would assume, right? Calibrate height. Cool. Comfort.

258
01:08:46,829 --> 01:08:54,079
Sprint vignette off. Smooth turn dot off. Belt size, ammo pouch position right.

259
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:58,140
Kill cam normal. Kill cam follows bullet. I guess it's just default off.

260
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:03,819
Graphics quality. Get that shit on fucking high, please. I got a 3090. Excuse me.

261
01:09:03,819 --> 01:09:12,659
What a flex. It's not a flex, though. I paid like three times the price for it.

262
01:09:12,659 --> 01:09:17,090
Like, it was a stupid thing to do. I had to get a graphics card. This is back when they didn't fucking exist.

263
01:09:17,090 --> 01:09:25,439
All right, let's go. This seems good. Okay, new game.

264
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:39,140
Right-handed. Teleport movement. Snap turning. Intense. Free movement. Why is he sick?

265
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:43,779
Free movement. Smooth turning. All comfort assists are off.

266
01:09:43,779 --> 01:09:54,020
Free movement. Snap turning. What should I put on? Put it on intense?

267
01:09:54,020 --> 01:10:01,359
You will puke if I don't put it on something else. Okay. So should I do...

268
01:10:01,359 --> 01:10:08,149
I don't think I want to do intense. You look like an action figure. Thanks.

269
01:10:08,149 --> 01:10:16,279
Intense, intense, moderate. I'm going to do moderate, okay? I don't want to puke.

270
01:10:16,279 --> 01:10:24,319
Difficulty select. That's fine. I'm going to get a giant VR video play.

271
01:10:24,319 --> 01:10:35,569
Take this opportunity. You know what I'm doing. Oh, you guys can't even see the movie.

272
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:37,630
I am... This is not...

273
01:10:39,630 --> 01:10:44,500
The height's wrong. I need to recalibrate the height, please. Hold on.

274
01:10:51,109 --> 01:10:56,310
Oh my god. That didn't help. That didn't help. Oh my god.

275
01:10:56,310 --> 01:11:04,939
Revert, revert, revert, revert, revert. Why is it doing this?

276
01:11:04,939 --> 01:11:11,100
I need to fix the floor. I'm way too fucking small. I am as tall as that child.

277
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:37,060
This is wrong. I can't pick anything up. That's a shitload of bread.

278
01:11:37,119 --> 01:11:55,539
We're going to eat all this bread? This is de-dust.

279
01:11:55,539 --> 01:11:59,909
This is actually de-dust.

280
01:12:02,710 --> 01:12:10,899
I'm sitting? I don't remember sitting.

281
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:24,699
Movement. Okay, walk here. Rotate. Alright, let's go.

282
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:34,489
Hold down the grab button. Out of bounds. What the fuck are you talking about, dude?

283
01:12:34,489 --> 01:12:41,210
Hold down the grab button. Oh, get the rifle? How am I supposed to get the rifle?

284
01:12:41,210 --> 01:12:46,140
It's like blocked. What? Oh.

285
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:55,100
Shit. It's the index. I have to hold it.

286
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:59,100
Stow the rifle by putting it over your shoulder. Great. Another fucking put it over your shoulder bullshit.

287
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:13,300
Up full. Okay. Move to the window. Okay. Draw your rifle.

288
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:21,430
You got it. Pull the bolt back. Retrieve ammo from your belt.

289
01:13:21,489 --> 01:13:34,529
Insert clip into rifle. Where does that go?

290
01:13:34,529 --> 01:13:39,539
Did that work? Push forward to relook. Okay. Hold on the rifle

291
01:13:39,539 --> 01:13:45,939
with your second hand. Raise and look through the scope.

292
01:13:45,939 --> 01:13:53,359
Oh my god. I don't know if you guys can see this. Can you guys see this?

293
01:13:53,359 --> 01:14:00,229
Can you guys see me aiming? You do? Okay. You can see through the

294
01:14:00,229 --> 01:14:05,989
everything? Good. Look through the scope. Who am I shooting? Squeeze the trigger to fire.

295
01:14:05,989 --> 01:14:11,750
Okay. Steady yourself. Hold your breath.

296
01:14:11,810 --> 01:14:20,779
In real life. Hold focus to steady aim.

297
01:14:20,779 --> 01:14:24,960
Focus slowly slows time and shows the hit indicator.

298
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:31,680
Okay. Hold focus to steady aim. How do I do that?

299
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:43,659
Oh shit. That's a fucking headshot. Oh this is fucking crazy.

300
01:14:43,659 --> 01:14:51,729
Radio. Where's the radio? Oh there it is.

301
01:14:51,729 --> 01:15:04,050
Rechamber. Use. Did I do it? Did I use

302
01:15:04,050 --> 01:15:15,680
the radio? Use. What do I do? Did I get it?

303
01:15:15,739 --> 01:15:20,489
Use. What do you want me to do? What does it want me to do?

304
01:15:20,489 --> 01:15:34,920
You already did it. Okay. Now what? It's a save point.

305
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:40,189
Why did I throw the gun? I'll just get it. That guy took the gun.

306
01:15:40,189 --> 01:15:47,680
Get to the gate. Okay.

307
01:15:47,680 --> 01:16:02,800
Oh I have a gun.

308
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:28,079
Alright. Both. That's Dante. Oh. Can I run faster?

309
01:16:28,079 --> 01:16:35,550
Sorry. Sorry. I'm the drunk guy again.

310
01:16:35,609 --> 01:16:50,630
Oh shit. Dante. Dante.

311
01:16:50,630 --> 01:16:56,840
Let's go. You can fuck with me buddy. Goodbye.

312
01:16:56,840 --> 01:17:11,159
That guy's dead. Oh over there. What? I thought that was

313
01:17:11,159 --> 01:17:22,890
explosive. It was explosive. Why did it take so long to get there?

314
01:17:22,890 --> 01:17:31,529
Did I get him? I got him. Oh sick. Shit.

315
01:17:31,529 --> 01:17:44,170
Got him. Headshot. Alright his brain.

316
01:17:44,170 --> 01:18:18,090
This bullet travel. Oops. Right in the knee. Alright let's go.

317
01:18:18,149 --> 01:18:28,279
Here. Take the weapons. Take them all.

318
01:18:28,279 --> 01:18:47,810
What's this? Let's go. Jump.

319
01:18:47,810 --> 01:19:00,819
Is that a bad guy or is that a good guy? I can't imagine. I feel like this is like a

320
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:15,029
modded Call of Duty. Alright I got full ammo. Let's go. Oh you

321
01:19:15,029 --> 01:19:39,539

322
01:19:39,539 --> 01:19:47,750
Who's left? Come on. Fuck.

323
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:53,720
I can get him. I'm not out of bounds you stupid game.

324
01:19:53,779 --> 01:20:12,539
Stop shaking. Oh. In the mouth.

325
01:20:12,539 --> 01:20:20,479
Who's left? I'm not even out of bounds. This is stupid.

326
01:20:20,479 --> 01:20:42,829
Where is he? No. I did it.

327
01:20:42,829 --> 01:20:48,100
You're stupid. It was all scripted. Who cares?

328
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:56,399
You're so sweaty. I know.

329
01:20:56,399 --> 01:21:01,020
Game audio is low?

330
01:21:01,079 --> 01:21:05,390
Interesting.

331
01:21:05,390 --> 01:21:10,829
Better?

332
01:21:10,829 --> 01:21:16,329
Oh hello kids.

333
01:21:20,329 --> 01:21:24,329
Do you look like a dancer?

334
01:21:29,710 --> 01:21:33,710
This game sucks. That's not fair. That's not fair. Don't say that.

335
01:21:33,770 --> 01:21:51,239
This is kind of fun. I'm actually just kidding. It's actually kind of fun.

336
01:21:51,239 --> 01:21:57,720
Boneworks 2? No. I'm just kidding. This is actually fun.

337
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:04,119
New mission. Let's do it. What am I doing out here?

338
01:22:04,119 --> 01:22:15,829
Wait did he have bread in his hand? Wait I think she has bread in her hands.

339
01:22:15,829 --> 01:22:20,520
God damn it. It's my day off. I don't want. Just leave me alone out here.

340
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:35,619
Why can't I just read Calvin and Hobbes in peace?

341
01:22:35,619 --> 01:22:45,800
Alright let's do it. Rifle range. Let's go.

342
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:51,800
No scopes?

343
01:22:56,229 --> 01:23:00,539
Brick and Morty now. No. You look like an Oompa Loompa.

344
01:23:00,539 --> 01:23:07,850
Just rewind an hour and figure out why. I just have these always.

345
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:18,069
Oh wait no. It's just Mjolnir.

346
01:23:18,130 --> 01:23:22,130
What?

347
01:23:28,130 --> 01:23:46,050
This is way better than that.

348
01:23:46,050 --> 01:23:57,810
What do you got? 10 targets? Where are they? Let's go.

349
01:23:57,810 --> 01:24:06,260
Why do I have to do this? You just taught me how to use the rifle.

350
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:15,479
That was so loud.

351
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:25,520
Alright. I'm going to talk shit about VR again.

352
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:30,699
I'm going to talk shit. Let's do it. This doesn't have to be here.

353
01:24:30,699 --> 01:24:34,699
You just showed me how to play the game.

354
01:24:34,699 --> 01:24:38,699
I don't have to learn how to play. You just showed it to me.

355
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:43,140
Do I need a tutorial shooting range? You just showed me how to play the game.

356
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:47,310
Why are you so terrified that I'm going to not know how to shoot the gun?

357
01:24:47,310 --> 01:24:57,250
Just do it. You know what I mean?

358
01:24:57,310 --> 01:25:12,090
It's like, let me tell you about this immersive story.

359
01:25:12,090 --> 01:25:16,090
Are you sure you know how to use the weapon? No. Get him out to a range and make sure he can hit a target.

360
01:25:16,090 --> 01:25:30,189
It is so loud. I know.

361
01:25:30,189 --> 01:25:47,260
Oh come on.

362
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:53,850
Deadly. Your voice was loud?

363
01:25:53,850 --> 01:26:05,640
You're talking mad smack for reloading with the wrong hand.

364
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:21,449
So now what do I do? Can I leave?

365
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:25,510
Use the pistol. Arm. Use grip to pull slide.

366
01:26:25,510 --> 01:26:29,930
And you reload. And then you go like this.

367
01:26:29,930 --> 01:26:40,170
Is it another range?

368
01:26:40,170 --> 01:26:45,800
God. Just let us play.

369
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:55,140
You're terrified that we don't know what we're doing.

370
01:26:55,140 --> 01:27:04,300
Pick up the grenade.

371
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:10,869
Hold to aim.

372
01:27:10,930 --> 01:27:21,039
Why did I just shrink? Oh okay. Hold to aim. What did I do?

373
01:27:21,039 --> 01:27:30,199
I pulled it out.

374
01:27:30,199 --> 01:27:35,060
Alright.

375
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:39,300
I'm literally sitting right in the center of my play area. What are you talking about?

376
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:45,189
Okay pistol area. Which is over there now. Alright let's go. Is there a teleport?

377
01:27:45,189 --> 01:28:01,560
No. Is there a fast run? Equip a pistol.

378
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:10,840
This is how you make a lot of people mad.

379
01:28:13,590 --> 01:28:18,920
I need a, I need a bullets.

380
01:28:30,930 --> 01:28:51,239
Not bad. Not bad.

01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:13,520
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Right yeah. He's not very good.

383
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:17,520
Is he? You don't think so? Oh look at him. I'm so far behind.

384
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:37,699
I went beware German snipers. What are you talking about? What's going on quit mission journal?

385
01:29:38,140 --> 01:30:00,239
Why is it do I get out of here? I began to feel at one with the weapon. We good. That's not bad

386
01:30:01,319 --> 01:30:09,149
Okay, now what over here was the pause button? I don't know

387
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:18,500
Ten rounds five seconds count of the hours. I spent at those ranges my comrades lives might depend on me hitting my tongue

388
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:22,550
Let's move. All right, let's go

389
01:30:35,300 --> 01:31:16,010
These weapons could be devastating if controlled properly to me. I need both bullets. What the fuck? I just fucking loaded it

390
01:31:16,010 --> 01:31:52,890
I just loaded this what this thing sucks. Why would I ever use this precision matted? All right, let's go

391
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:55,960

01:32:15,819 --> 01:32:19,699
Then had to gather what weapons and supplies we could from the battlefield

397
01:32:20,539 --> 01:32:22,539
Okay, I'll take a sniper rifle

398

Okay, I'll take a sniper rifle shotgun alpha bravo Charlie so that I got the shotgun that and the Charlie

401
01:33:06,119 --> 01:33:17,800
Hey, what the fuck are you talking about place your favorite weapons into these loadout crates and they'll be shipped off to the various

402
01:33:18,510 --> 01:33:21,939

Here we go in the moments before his death Dante had made a contact with the Allies and begged them for help

414
01:35:27,420 --> 01:35:29,420
We could only keep fighting. Hope they had heard

415
01:35:29,460 --> 01:35:36,819
Let's go in the moments before his death and they had made contact with the Allies and begged

416
01:35:36,819 --> 01:35:40,720

01:41:20,250 --> 01:41:30,890
I got a head. I'd show that guy in the head

445
01:41:30,890 --> 01:41:34,449
I saw the guy in the head with a shotgun from like 600 meters away

446
01:41:35,369 --> 01:41:37,050
Holy shit

447
01:41:37,050 --> 01:41:49,189
Give me them. All right sniper rifle father. The area was too overrun and it was up to me to hold off

But we would need help from above

453
01:42:43,460 --> 01:42:45,460
I'm not fucking around anymore

454
01:42:45,779 --> 01:42:52,829
Just no fucking ammo in this gun

01:42:53,510 --> 01:42:58,460
I'm trying as hard as I can. Let's go

456

What the fuck are you talking about? Not this time not fucking around this time. I'm not fucking around this time

458
01:43:38,340 --> 01:43:53,819
Where is he? Where is he father had taken charge of the unit? All right, where's the car?

459
01:43:54,520 --> 01:44:00,109
As the enemy closed in on us. I knew only I could save my

462
01:44:14,189 --> 01:44:17,739
How is that not?

463
01:44:17,739 --> 01:44:31,109
Fuck. Oh shit. They're over here

464
01:44:31,590 --> 01:44:44,100
The Allies had sent a bomber to try to cut off the enemy fuck I

465
01:44:54,189 --> 01:45:03,970
I don't understand

466

01:48:24,619 --> 01:48:33,920

01:48:34,760 --> 01:48:40,109
I'm angry now. Let's go

01:48:40,109 --> 01:49:01,729
Father had taken charge of the unit, but he was no leader as the enemy close yet

494
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:31,890
The area was too overrun. That's not it. It was up to me to hold off before the bomber

495
01:52:32,250 --> 01:52:34,250
a

496
01:52:36,569 --> 01:52:38,569
YouTube poop video

497
01:52:38,649 --> 01:52:42,010
They use that same loud fucking noise in every YouTube poop

501
01:53:36,119 --> 01:58:47,279
I'm done with that one. I'm going to the bathroom playing something else. I'm gonna pee the hair. I'm back

502
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:51,149
That game was really fun. It's just kind of hard

503
01:58:51,710 --> 01:58:53,989
like the scope

504
01:58:53,989 --> 01:58:56,869
Is that one a stamp of approval?

505
01:58:57,029 --> 01:59:12,689
Just fun. Let me untangle this thing. Hold on. We had a party while you were gone

506
01:59:13,090 --> 01:59:27,420
All right. Let me take a look what I have left. There's so many VR games. Let me see what's I need to wipe this down a little

507
01:59:28,380 --> 01:59:30,510
Give me one sec

508
01:59:30,510 --> 01:59:38,510
The volume is gonna have to come down to

509
01:59:39,390 --> 01:59:46,640
He forgot to wipe. I can't believe I did the fart in the microphone joke, by the way

510
01:59:50,489 --> 01:59:59,439
The whole time I was peeing I'm just thinking about the fart in the microphone thing fuck I did do that didn't I

511
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:03,380
All right. I'm going back in I'm gonna turn the cam back on in

512
02:00:03,859 --> 02:00:07,569
30 seconds or so. Hold on. Let me just get in here

513
02:00:10,970 --> 02:00:12,890
What should we play?

514
02:00:12,890 --> 02:00:14,409
Let's take a look

515
02:00:14,409 --> 02:00:24,399
That was Sniper Elite VR and it was pretty good. We've got

516
02:00:27,739 --> 02:00:34,399
L.A. Noire Case Files, Arbar, Compound

517
02:00:38,300 --> 02:00:45,659
We've got Hellsplit Arena. We've got Rick and Morty, Virtual Rick-Ally, of course we do

518
02:00:46,479 --> 02:00:50,039
Hmm. I wonder what should we do

519
02:00:56,399 --> 02:01:02,529
Compound? L.A. Noire, L.A. Noire. I'll do L.A. Noire

520
02:01:03,609 --> 02:01:15,520
Is L.A. Noire long? How long is L.A. Noire? It's 20 hours in VR. Oh my god

521
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:26,560
It's the whole game in VR. No, it's not. I thought it was the VR case files. It's like 30 minutes. Okay

522
02:01:26,880 --> 02:01:30,640
All right. I'm gonna load it up and we'll give it 30-40 minutes. We'll see we'll give it an hour

523
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:46,550
L.A. Noire the VR case files. Let's go. I'm coming back on. Hello there. Hi. How you doing?

524
02:01:46,550 --> 02:01:48,430
I might have to lower the volume here

525
02:01:48,430 --> 02:01:57,170
So there's a lot of people that wanted me to go back to L.A. Noire

526
02:01:57,810 --> 02:02:01,609
After I played it two or three times and got halfway through the game and gave up forever

527
02:02:02,750 --> 02:02:05,119
Here is your stream

528
02:02:05,279 --> 02:02:07,279
This is probably the last time I'm ever gonna play this

529
02:02:07,279 --> 02:02:23,630
I have piss stains. I do not have piss stains. All right, where is it? Computer crash?

530
02:02:24,510 --> 02:02:39,949
Apparently, it's apparently it's coming. Let me make sure it didn't crash. I don't think so. Where is it?

531
02:02:39,949 --> 02:02:45,529
Oh, I have to select an I've to select a language with my mouse

Okay, i'm going

All right. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm not ready

vr case

554
02:05:09,829 --> 02:05:13,109
I forgot the name of the game. I don't remember what game we're playing

555
02:05:14,270 --> 02:05:17,729
Rockstar's vr case files is what I thought the game was actually called

556
02:05:18,449 --> 02:05:21,460
It's gonna be a long one. I'll tell you

557
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,500
All right

558
02:05:28,500 --> 02:05:31,649
All right

559
02:05:31,649 --> 02:05:36,850
Are you ready? Are you ready air?

560
02:05:39,250 --> 02:05:42,470

561
02:05:42,470 --> 02:05:44,470
Please select your base station configuration

562
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:54,819
My base stations face each other my controllers are accurately tracked no matter which way the hell you what rockstar

563
02:05:54,899 --> 02:06:04,069
What are you what are you doing? It's like base station configuration my base. Yeah, they

Calibrating height and play space, please stand in the middle of your play area

566
02:06:22,319 --> 02:06:27,000
Look straight ahead and press the right thumb stick

567
02:06:28,840 --> 02:06:39,270
Provided with you some people get sick when they're in vr. This is a fictional video game really trying to take me completely out of this

568
02:06:40,069 --> 02:06:44,279
What is all this? What do I have to sign like a fucking agreement to play the game?

569
02:06:44,279 --> 02:06:46,520
It's like la noir the game came out 10 years ago

570
02:06:57,460 --> 02:06:59,460
It came out 19 years ago

571
02:06:59,859 --> 02:07:01,539
What have a hat?

572
02:07:01,539 --> 02:07:03,539
Look at the wall to make a selection

573
02:07:06,180 --> 02:07:07,220
new

574
02:07:07,220 --> 02:07:14,239
All right new game

575
02:07:14,239 --> 02:07:18,800
At any point in the game, you need to recalibrate your play space press and hold the right thumb stick. Try it

576
02:07:19,520 --> 02:07:22,800
I know anymore. You have to examine clues to open

577
02:07:23,680 --> 02:07:27,359
And close your hands press the trigger and grip buttons. Look at how your hands close

578
02:07:28,319 --> 02:07:39,079
Oh god, was this go back? How do I go back? Hold the grip or trigger to pick things up?

579
02:07:39,720 --> 02:07:46,930
Okay

580
02:07:46,930 --> 02:07:50,210
Cool, you can crouch down to pick up objects by pressing the left thumb stick

581
02:07:50,930 --> 02:07:52,930
Pick up the pen. Okay

582
02:07:52,930 --> 02:07:57,590
Stand back up

583
02:07:57,590 --> 02:07:59,590
Okay interact with the press the trigger

584
02:08:00,319 --> 02:08:05,680
Weapons in la noir use a toggle grip press the grip button again to drop the revolver. Okay, so you go like that

585
02:08:06,789 --> 02:08:10,470
Grip preferences can be changed. So it's just like this and you go like that

586
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:12,960
like the case

587
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:14,960
From the case folder using the trigger

588
02:08:19,359 --> 02:08:21,359
City of los angeles start

589
02:08:21,359 --> 02:08:32,180
Okay, i'm excited. Well, it's a shame. You don't like to talk about it. Cole ralph

590
02:08:32,819 --> 02:08:36,260
Friends who want to stay friends don't discuss religion or politics

591
02:08:36,899 --> 02:08:38,899
And in my case you can add the war to that

592
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:47,489
To rotate felps move the right thumb stick

593
02:08:48,210 --> 02:08:56,079
Okay, let's turn who is that? I know that window bow away before he jumped for all

594
02:08:56,960 --> 02:08:59,890
La noir has three different movement modes press a to continue

595
02:09:00,449 --> 02:09:03,590
Depending on your vr experience some forms of navigation may cause discomfort

596
02:09:03,970 --> 02:09:06,529
You can navigate to any position using your

597
02:09:06,750 --> 02:09:13,189
Recticle double tap left a or right a to bring up your recticle and pressing it and navigate to the position

598
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:17,960
No, I don't

599

02:47:55,319 --> 02:47:57,079
This is really fucked

933
02:47:57,079 --> 02:48:00,500
Yeah, this is fucked up. Yeah, I don't know if um

934
02:48:03,319 --> 02:48:05,399
I don't know if la noir is gonna work out

935
02:48:07,280 --> 02:48:13,120
Somebody said that this came out when the vibe was a thing and they probably haven't updated it a very long time

936
02:48:14,719 --> 02:48:17,590
Damn it

937
02:48:17,590 --> 02:48:19,430
Uh, give me one sec

938
02:48:19,430 --> 02:48:24,389
It crashes a lot

939
02:48:24,389 --> 02:48:27,270
The cord's fine. Yeah, I checked the cords. Everything seems plugged in

940
02:48:28,229 --> 02:48:33,989
There's an old ass game it doesn't support index fuck well that was fun for what I got to see

941
02:48:35,030 --> 02:48:39,350
It's time for rick and morty

942
02:48:39,350 --> 02:48:43,350
All right. I will play rick and morty vr for 30 minutes if you promise that none of you will leave

943
02:48:44,229 --> 02:48:58,280
Promise me you won't leave and i'll do it. All right library. What do we got?

944
02:48:59,250 --> 02:49:01,329
Um, let me see. Let me see. There's something else. I want to play

945
02:49:04,440 --> 02:49:05,879
there's

946
02:49:05,879 --> 02:49:13,319
I want to play compound that looked really fun. All right, we're playing compound

947
02:49:14,120 --> 02:49:19,520
Let me go pee one more time because I know i'm gonna have to in like five minutes i'll be right back

948
02:49:20,319 --> 02:51:04,319
Okay, i'm back

949
02:51:04,319 --> 02:51:06,399
Let's go ahead and open up a compound

950
02:51:07,760 --> 02:51:11,409
And we'll continue

951
02:51:11,409 --> 02:51:13,729
Uh mods change it to compound, please if you could

952
02:51:20,229 --> 02:51:21,829
That's so sad

953
02:51:21,829 --> 02:51:38,309
That seemed like that was really picking up too. Oh, well. Oh, well, I want to see more

954
02:51:39,030 --> 02:51:40,469
thriving

955
02:51:40,469 --> 02:51:43,920
That was kind of terrible to be honest

956
02:51:44,559 --> 02:51:46,559
I really feel like I was gonna be sick

957
02:51:46,639 --> 02:51:50,799
Because when you're moving what you're not moving forward it really does a toll on your brain

958
02:51:55,840 --> 02:51:58,399
It just hammers your like right in the frontal lobe

959
02:51:59,360 --> 02:52:03,459
All right. Let's do it compound time

960
02:52:06,790 --> 02:52:08,790
Damn, dude, you shit out of that fat ass

961
02:52:09,190 --> 02:52:10,549
Listen to me

962
02:52:10,549 --> 02:52:13,200
You have to understand something

963
02:52:13,200 --> 02:52:15,010
I look

964
02:52:15,010 --> 02:52:18,370
I'm wearing a thing that's like compressing my back

965
02:52:19,170 --> 02:52:21,809
So it might look like I have whatever

966
02:52:22,610 --> 02:52:29,319
What do you want me to say?

967
02:52:29,319 --> 02:52:33,000
Why did I read that because it was there and it was for me. I could see it

968
02:52:33,719 --> 02:52:51,489
I could see it. All right, let's go

969
02:52:51,809 --> 02:52:58,200
Wait, you can't even see

970
02:52:58,200 --> 02:53:01,329
Hey, I can

971
02:53:01,389 --> 02:53:10,129
Compound vr. Let's do it. I'm gonna bring you guys back shit

972
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:17,780
Oh

973
02:53:17,780 --> 02:53:21,989
Aha. All right, let's move

974
02:53:23,399 --> 02:53:31,829
All right currently selected no snap turning like minecraft, uh select your controllers i'm using

975
02:53:32,790 --> 02:53:33,510
the

976
02:53:33,510 --> 02:53:37,409
How I select oh

977
02:53:37,409 --> 02:53:39,170
the index

978
02:53:39,170 --> 02:53:42,129
This is the valve index

979
02:53:42,129 --> 02:53:48,069
Turning option currently selected snap. No snap turning locomotion. That sounds good to me

980
02:53:49,030 --> 02:53:52,770
Uh, I think this is probably pretty good pick up the gun

981
02:53:54,229 --> 02:54:00,020
Pistol and shoot the icons select the desired options. All right, let's move

982
02:54:00,739 --> 02:54:03,430
This feels pretty good

983
02:54:03,829 --> 02:54:06,229
How loud is that can you yeah, why can't I see you guys?

984
02:54:06,950 --> 02:54:10,020

What the fuck come on

986
02:54:15,940 --> 02:54:21,120
Report this to the developers

987
02:54:21,440 --> 02:54:24,579
Give me another second. Hold on

988
02:54:24,819 --> 02:54:34,870
Is it loud? I'll turn it down a little

989
02:54:49,319 --> 02:54:53,799
Okay report. I was playing la noir. Yeah, so la noir really fucked everything up

990
02:54:55,489 --> 02:54:59,639
Make sure that's fixed

991
02:54:59,639 --> 02:55:15,510
No, there's another like crash tab. What the fuck what let me i'm gonna restart steam vr. Hold on. This whole thing is messed up now

02:57:23,399 --> 02:57:24,680

02:57:24,680 --> 02:57:31,459
Thank you for your patience. Appreciate it

997
02:57:33,040 --> 02:57:35,040
And we should be able to go back into this now

998
02:57:38,319 --> 02:57:39,680
Can you see it?

999
02:57:39,680 --> 02:57:41,680
No, there I am

1000
02:57:41,840 --> 02:57:44,239
And you should be here. There you are

1001
02:57:44,940 --> 02:57:46,549
Fantastic

1002
02:57:46,549 --> 02:57:48,149
All right, let's try this again

1003
02:57:48,149 --> 02:58:03,479
Fucking vr. All right, get me in all just for the loud noises when I touch this thing

1004
02:58:04,360 --> 02:58:05,959
I'm capturing

1005
02:58:05,959 --> 02:58:07,959
There you guys are. Thank you

1006
02:58:10,420 --> 02:58:12,100
Back to it. Come on

1007
02:58:12,100 --> 02:58:20,200
Index this is fucking loud though. It really is

1008
02:58:21,430 --> 02:58:22,950
loud for me

1009
02:58:22,950 --> 02:58:27,559
Which means it's probably really loud for you

1010
02:58:32,020 --> 02:58:34,020
Rebel hq fuck it's itchy

1011
02:58:34,659 --> 02:58:43,620
This is really kind of nice looking though

1012
02:58:44,180 --> 02:58:46,180
tutorial and shooting range

1013
02:58:47,409 --> 02:58:50,530
Very cool. Oh, it actually is like completely index compatible

1014
02:58:51,879 --> 02:58:54,920
Nice nice. It is like this is cool. I like it

1015
02:58:56,100 --> 02:58:58,180
I really actually really like it a lot so far

1016
02:58:58,899 --> 02:59:09,510
All right. Cool. You make hamburgers and shit. That's awesome

1017
02:59:10,229 --> 02:59:12,790
Uh currently selected easy as pie medium

1018
02:59:15,190 --> 02:59:17,909
Uh, I don't want hard boost. That's probably throw up

1019
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:22,000
Okay, let's do the uh shooting range

1020
02:59:24,549 --> 02:59:26,579
Oh

1021
02:59:26,579 --> 02:59:29,219
Hot dogs horseshoes and hand grenades. It's by the same people

1022
02:59:30,180 --> 02:59:36,340
Dude, this is fucking really actually really fun

1023
02:59:36,979 --> 02:59:38,979
That was cool. Do I have to reload it?

1024
02:59:39,299 --> 02:59:53,489
Out of a reload, okay fire a few bursts at the target until you completely run out of ammo in the horizontal clip

1025
02:59:54,129 --> 02:59:56,549
Those the bullet spread is too high to hit anything distant

1026
02:59:57,270 --> 02:59:59,969
Sure

1027
02:59:59,969 --> 03:00:03,409
Okay, reloading is a skill and you'll need to practice

1028
03:00:06,399 --> 03:00:11,399
How do I get it?

1029
03:00:11,399 --> 03:00:15,239
To reload the smg press the spawn ammo button on your offhand controller

1030
03:00:15,799 --> 03:00:18,200
Pull a clip out and attach to the top

1031
03:00:21,379 --> 03:00:24,500
Oh shit

1032
03:00:24,500 --> 03:00:27,270
Okay

1033
03:00:27,270 --> 03:00:29,270
Hang off the clip. You'll be ready to fire

1034
03:00:29,670 --> 03:00:37,969
How are you doing weapon action button? Oh shit

1035
03:00:48,340 --> 03:00:50,340
That's cool. All right. What about the other ones?

1036
03:00:50,979 --> 03:00:52,709
What is this?

1037
03:00:52,709 --> 03:00:53,829
Oh

1038
03:00:53,829 --> 03:01:00,530
This feels really good. Okay. Now I can how do I open this? All right, like you can go like this

1039
03:01:05,920 --> 03:01:11,250
That's fun. What about this one? I have to hold it with two hands. I do

1040
03:01:12,280 --> 03:01:14,280
Oh shit, it's like a sniper rifle

1041
03:01:14,680 --> 03:01:24,180
All right. Well, how do I load this one? Good noise. It's got really good noises. It does

1042
03:01:24,819 --> 03:01:28,290
How do I load rail gun is perfect dealing with high damage long range, right?

1043
03:01:29,110 --> 03:01:31,110
Four shots take your time

1044
03:01:33,700 --> 03:01:37,620
Okay, put a stripper clip on the bolt opening on top of the rail gun

1045
03:01:38,260 --> 03:01:42,799
Isn't it going here?

1046
03:01:42,799 --> 03:01:52,709
It doesn't do that. It doesn't do that. How do I do that? Am I doing this wrong? How do I do that?

1047
03:01:53,860 --> 03:02:01,670
Line it up

1048
03:02:01,670 --> 03:02:05,379
One face forward

1049
03:02:05,379 --> 03:02:11,750
What are you doing? Orange goes forward

1050
03:02:14,930 --> 03:02:22,129
Oh

1051
03:02:22,129 --> 03:02:24,129
This thing is okay. That's cool. What about this one?

1052
03:02:27,110 --> 03:02:35,829
Oh cool

1053
03:02:35,829 --> 03:02:40,309
Nice. What else?

1054
03:02:40,309 --> 03:02:47,329
How do I oh shit

1055
03:02:50,610 --> 03:02:53,809
So far the gunplay is fucking phenomenal. I will say

1056
03:03:01,559 --> 03:03:04,719
Oh

1057
03:03:04,719 --> 03:03:08,559
All right. How do I reload this?

1058
03:03:08,559 --> 03:03:09,920
This is like this

1059
03:03:09,920 --> 03:03:11,120
Oh shit

1060
03:03:11,120 --> 03:03:16,819
Okay. What about this one? This is fun

1061
03:03:17,379 --> 03:03:23,989
Okay. Now this goes

1062
03:03:23,989 --> 03:03:34,360
Where does this go in here?

1063
03:03:34,360 --> 03:03:37,250
Cool. Did I know you didn't use this one? What does this one do?

1064
03:03:37,809 --> 03:03:46,579
Okay, how does this one reload just like that?

1065
03:03:46,979 --> 03:03:59,719
I love it. I I actually oh, there's a bow and arrow you are you kidding me? Oops

1066
03:04:00,520 --> 03:04:01,479
Where am I?

1067
03:04:01,479 --> 03:04:06,879
Give me that

1068
03:04:06,879 --> 03:04:09,280
No way

1069
03:04:09,280 --> 03:04:11,600
Grab grab bows with your offhand

1070
03:04:19,559 --> 03:04:25,200
This is sick

1071
03:04:25,200 --> 03:04:39,219
Wait, hold on. That's fun

1072
03:04:39,219 --> 03:04:54,290
Emergency handgun does it have infinite ammo? It does

1073
03:04:55,090 --> 03:05:00,870
Store. Oh wait store weapon move weapon action

1074
03:05:01,510 --> 03:05:05,270
Fire spawn ammo grab drop. All right, let's do it. I'm ready. This is fucking awesome

1075
03:05:07,909 --> 03:05:10,309
Switching to your pistol is always faster than reloading

1076
03:05:10,870 --> 03:05:13,219
Now, let me do a stretch

1077
03:05:13,219 --> 03:05:16,440
Music by speed black enter the compound

1078
03:05:18,020 --> 03:05:18,979

03:05:18,979 --> 03:05:25,239
Let me be sure i'm in the right spot

Practice area. All right

You give me that emergency handgun. How do you store like that? Okay. So how do I pull it back out?

1082
03:05:32,870 --> 03:05:34,440
Good to know

1083
03:05:34,440 --> 03:05:36,440
So I don't have to hold the grip

1084
03:05:37,200 --> 03:05:40,469
Actually, maybe I do

1085
03:05:40,799 --> 03:05:42,899
Maybe I do

1086
03:05:42,899 --> 03:05:44,899
Yeah, that's actually better though. Okay, cool

1087
03:05:44,979 --> 03:05:48,180
Uh, there's the options mutation dispenser

1088
03:05:48,819 --> 03:05:50,479
I don't know what that is

1089
03:05:50,479 --> 03:05:57,090
repair shower

1090
03:05:57,090 --> 03:05:58,850
removes mutations

1091
03:05:58,850 --> 03:06:04,979
Let's just go

1092
03:06:04,979 --> 03:06:11,139
underground sewers

1093
03:06:11,139 --> 03:06:13,139
All right. I died. Can I get two handguns?

1094
03:06:24,959 --> 03:06:26,399
This is awesome

1095
03:06:26,399 --> 03:06:27,920
This is awesome

1096
03:06:27,920 --> 03:07:01,059
All right. Good. Good. Good. Where we going? I need a gun. This is actually like the funnest vr game i've ever played

ammo map clear

1099
03:07:14,260 --> 03:07:17,459
Danger poisonous chemicals electric hazard join the core via corpse

1100
03:07:18,870 --> 03:07:28,309
Oh, that's how you cycle. Okay, so I did it. Oh shit. All right

1121
03:10:08,659 --> 03:10:11,299
Itchiness nausea balding brain damage

1122
03:10:11,940 --> 03:10:22,690

1123
03:10:22,690 --> 03:10:26,469

I can't all right. Well, whatever. I don't need it. Let's go. Oh fuck

1131
03:11:37,620 --> 03:11:43,959
It's the rail gun, right?

1132
03:11:43,959 --> 03:11:57,840
Oh shit

1133
03:11:57,840 --> 03:12:05,430
This is all right. Is there other bosses in this game? Because if it is are they bosses?

1134
03:12:06,229 --> 03:12:13,200
Rail gun has a scope

1135
03:12:13,200 --> 03:12:15,200
Use the scope. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I see

1136
03:12:15,440 --> 03:12:21,329
reception and sales too

1137
03:12:31,030 --> 03:12:34,420
Oh shit

1138
03:12:54,559 --> 03:13:13,040
Maniac what?

1139
03:13:13,040 --> 03:13:14,239
Oh my god

1140
03:13:14,239 --> 03:13:20,129
Did they get him?

1141
03:13:20,129 --> 03:13:23,840
workers workers

1142
03:13:29,270 --> 03:13:48,840
Holy shit. All right. Give me this ammo. Where's my actual health? Oh shit. I had I have a thing here

1143
03:13:53,409 --> 03:14:27,379
Oh, that's cool. All right. I'm really into this. This is actually really fun. What happened? Did I die?

1144
03:14:41,719 --> 03:15:04,370
That was a colat. Yeah, that was fun. All right, let's keep going. What does it say my ammo does it say my ammo somewhere

1145
03:15:05,399 --> 03:15:07,079
32 13, okay

1146
03:15:07,079 --> 03:15:25,559
You actually put the game on easy. I did when I put it on the regular difficulty. What's our vaccine?

1147
03:15:25,559 --> 03:15:28,440
All right, this uh, this game's an early access still that's

1148
03:15:29,489 --> 03:15:36,920
Really surprising actually

1149
03:15:48,500 --> 03:15:49,780
Oh

1150
03:15:49,780 --> 03:15:58,870
Nothing over there. We're good. It's easy

1151
03:15:59,510 --> 03:16:02,790
It's early access and yet it's still better than a lot of triple a games. I mean, this is fun

1152
03:16:03,350 --> 03:16:07,809
This is one of the sickest alpha games i've ever seen if this is alpha

1153
03:16:09,040 --> 03:16:11,040
I mean, this is really fun

1154
03:16:12,129 --> 03:16:14,770
If they're bosses then this is like i'm gonna give it a pretty

1155
03:16:28,819 --> 03:16:34,120
That it

1156
03:16:49,540 --> 03:16:56,709
I kind of want a different gun

1157
03:16:56,709 --> 03:17:00,040
You know what?

1158
03:17:00,040 --> 03:17:16,229
I want this that thing's fun, but this one's better where we at. Okay, I gotta go

1159
03:17:17,829 --> 03:17:30,979
This way

1160
03:17:30,979 --> 03:17:41,649
Hell, yeah. Yes continue. Whoops. Don't leave that

1161
03:17:42,659 --> 03:17:44,260
That would have been really bad

1162
03:17:44,260 --> 03:18:04,719
It's drop time to stream up only where am I going? Oh, this place is pretty big right through here. Holy shit. Okay

1163
03:18:08,840 --> 03:18:12,680
Oh my god, it's the fucking thing from the terminator. Not the terminator fucking the

1164
03:18:13,159 --> 03:18:18,200
Um robocop robocop robocop robocop robocop robocop robocop robocop

1165
03:18:33,920 --> 03:19:02,680
Give me this eat the hot dogs. We're good suspicious including women children elderly. All right, we're good

1166
03:19:06,559 --> 03:19:29,010
Cat puke I want that. Oh shit. It hurt. No, no, no, no, no

1167
03:19:34,129 --> 03:19:43,479
Oh fuck

1168
03:19:43,479 --> 03:19:52,120
This is a gamer game. I'm telling you

1169
03:19:52,120 --> 03:19:54,120
This bullet lead to

1170
03:19:55,540 --> 03:19:57,139
Oh that hurt

1171
03:19:57,139 --> 03:20:22,450
I missed something over here. What did I miss over here? There's like a hidden thing right here. What is this?

1172
03:20:23,010 --> 03:20:30,500
Oh nothing

1173
03:20:30,500 --> 03:20:33,700
Gamer game. There's no bosses on easy. Can you do a weld?

1174
03:20:34,420 --> 03:20:38,739
Um, I think it'd be hard to move and do a weld actually maybe not because I can move with the right stick too

1175
03:20:39,620 --> 03:20:56,180
I'll try it. Oh shit

1176
03:21:04,129 --> 03:21:19,840
Oh god, this is gonna be hard i'm gonna i'll give it a try you can only shoot him a couple times though

1177
03:21:23,909 --> 03:21:40,870
Not worth it

1178
03:21:51,319 --> 03:22:00,399
Uh burger, uh, I haven't gone this way. Let's go straight

1179
03:22:13,889 --> 03:22:21,760
Sick. All right. Good the contrast between now and sniper elite

1180
03:22:23,680 --> 03:22:36,819
I mean sniper elite is that game is more precise. This is more about like moving around fast. That's it, right?

1181
03:22:38,280 --> 03:22:44,229
It is let's go try a harder difficulty

1182
03:22:44,950 --> 03:22:49,559
Weapon unlocked laser pistol. I'll up the difficulty if I can after this

1183
03:22:51,250 --> 03:22:55,670
I feel like this is gonna be probably a boss

1184
03:22:56,340 --> 03:23:00,049
number one priority

1185
03:23:00,290 --> 03:23:05,510
Oh my god, wrong way wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong

1186
03:23:06,549 --> 03:23:59,969
Who's calling god damn. Sorry. I'm being like silent gamer right now. This is sorry

1187
03:24:00,450 --> 03:24:05,479
There's no commentary just weird guy in vr with like a big ass plays compound

1188
03:24:20,360 --> 03:24:23,270
Yeah

1189
03:24:23,270 --> 03:24:29,010
All right. This is a huge level. Should I go down?

1190
03:24:29,649 --> 03:24:37,379
I'm thinking probably go up

1191
03:24:37,379 --> 03:24:45,399
Are we clear? I guess I should I investigate

1192
03:24:46,200 --> 03:25:11,139
There's nothing else in here really up the elevator. I think that's right go up go down. Oh shit right here

1193
03:25:12,180 --> 03:25:21,090
Very very oh new weapon. No, I already had that

1194
03:25:21,729 --> 03:25:30,530
Give me something new. I don't want that. I don't like that thing. Somebody said reloading sounds like eating a radish

1195
03:25:31,170 --> 03:25:54,629
I guess all right new level. Where's the exit? Oh, it's over here

1196
03:26:05,090 --> 03:26:10,930
Profit management too. Does it any idea how much more I have before like a boss or something or is it procedurally generated?

1197
03:26:22,850 --> 03:26:28,500
No bosses. There's no bosses in easy. Oh, so should I like back out and put it on higher difficulty?

1198
03:26:33,280 --> 03:26:47,299
That looks like a boss

1199
03:26:47,379 --> 03:26:49,219
shit

1200
03:26:49,219 --> 03:26:56,559
It's easy eric

1201
03:26:56,559 --> 03:26:58,559
I'll change it. Oh my god

1202
03:27:00,280 --> 03:27:16,979
Easy eric after this level that is the only boss that's on easy

1203
03:27:23,219 --> 03:27:31,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever it's all right, okay, let's play on on harder, okay hard

1204
03:27:32,319 --> 03:27:37,440
Where do I put this? How do I make the game hard?

1205
03:27:39,479 --> 03:28:10,389
Take it with me. So it's now's on hard. All right, let's go. I need a gun. Let's fucking go

1206
03:28:10,549 --> 03:28:26,549
Oh

1207
03:28:26,549 --> 03:28:57,299
Okay, hard henry. That's right. Ooh new weapon. Yes. All right, cool. Jax is back

1208
03:28:58,180 --> 03:29:00,180
For a brief moment. He is

1209
03:29:00,420 --> 03:29:05,559
maybe

1210
03:29:05,559 --> 03:29:07,639
Warning you are being hunted by what?

1211
03:29:16,040 --> 03:29:21,879
Oh my god, what the why am I moving backwards? Stop moving backwards. Why am I moving backwards?

1212
03:29:22,120 --> 03:29:25,620
What the fuck? I was trying to move forwards

1213
03:29:26,180 --> 03:29:33,139
All right, let's go go go go go go go

1214
03:29:33,700 --> 03:29:39,860
Fuck i'm starting to feel it

1215
03:29:39,860 --> 03:29:45,299
in my chest

1216
03:29:45,379 --> 03:29:48,020
The boomer brace can only do so much. It's almost uh

1217
03:29:49,190 --> 03:29:53,459
Oh, hold on. Let me see how this plays

1218
03:29:55,440 --> 03:29:57,440
Okay, now we go like this

1219
03:29:57,760 --> 03:30:00,079
It goes down like that close it

1220
03:30:08,129 --> 03:30:10,229
end of the stream voice

1221
03:30:10,229 --> 03:30:12,229
Not quite but almost

1222
03:30:16,069 --> 03:30:23,139
Oh fuck what i'll get it

1223
03:30:36,049 --> 03:30:54,319
What is that? Oh, it's this thing. All right, fuck that weird rat thing

1224
03:30:57,000 --> 03:31:19,399
We're good. Oh, okay. It has direct hit. Oh shit i'm out of ammo

1225
03:31:31,200 --> 03:31:45,559

03:32:10,290 --> 03:32:12,290
But my body's like breaking down

03:32:14,559 --> 03:32:32,120
Right in here. I can feel it. Holy shit. How do you kill this thing?

1230
03:32:32,440 --> 03:32:57,430
I really don't want to have to do this, but I think i'm gonna have to stop. Ah

1231
03:32:58,979 --> 03:33:01,299
Why

1232
03:33:01,299 --> 03:33:08,319

It would have been like an 8 point. No, it would have been like a 7 7

1427
04:01:56,709 --> 04:01:58,629
But I mean like miko, you know what I mean?

1428
04:02:00,840 --> 04:02:07,569
Uh sniper elite vr was probably like an a but I just couldn't handle it. So i'm gonna give it like a c plus

1429
04:02:08,530 --> 04:02:14,850
Then compound was an a plus

1430
04:02:15,729 --> 04:02:19,120
What was between that?

1431
04:02:19,120 --> 04:02:20,639
What else did I do?

1432
04:02:20,639 --> 04:02:24,950
What was the third game?

1433
04:02:24,950 --> 04:02:30,290
L.A. Noire. All right that that that would have been so much fun

1434
04:02:31,170 --> 04:02:32,850
I would have stayed in that

1435
04:02:32,850 --> 04:02:38,610
Then obviously tilt brush is like

1436
04:02:38,690 --> 04:02:40,690
Five out of five

1437
04:02:40,690 --> 04:02:45,360
So on sunday, we'll probably open with um

1438
04:02:46,159 --> 04:02:48,920

1439
04:02:49,879 --> 04:02:54,229

1441
04:03:03,110 --> 04:03:05,110

1442
04:03:05,430 --> 04:03:13,620
And thanks for the subs. I couldn't really see

1445
04:03:26,319 --> 04:03:37,030

1446
04:03:37,030 --> 04:03:40,229
It's really not that bad

1447
04:03:40,309 --> 04:03:54,950
Could be way worse

1448
04:03:55,030 --> 04:03:57,030
Bath time with jeremy

1449
04:04:03,379 --> 04:04:05,379
