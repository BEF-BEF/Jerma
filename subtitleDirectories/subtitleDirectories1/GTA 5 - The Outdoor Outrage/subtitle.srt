1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,820
I just get so tired on these long road trips. Man, I need a coffee or something.

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,820
What's with all these people with their lights? Learn how to fucking drive. I mean, seriously.

3
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,410
Look, downtown cab company. Will you leave me alone? Like, can I just like block downtown cab company?

4
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,410
Because they just, well, we got a random event. Robbery. Robbery in progress.

5
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:38,799
Can I seriously just say, I kill the person getting robbed in these random events more often than not.

6
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:40,799
Like, this happens all the time.

7
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:07,939
To clarify, that was a joke about a bus driver installing off-road capabilities to his school bus.

8
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:12,939
And delivering some unruly children to their school in a very unorthodox fashion.

9
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:16,200
Back to the show.

10
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,890
See, I don't know why mummy doesn't want me to play in the street. It's fun. Look.

11
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:27,900
So here's a challenge for you guys that have GTA V and are looking for something difficult to do.

12
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,900
Hop on a dirt bike like this, get on the highest mountain, and drive down in cinematic mode.

13
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,900
If you can make it to the bottom, you won. Because it's like impossible.

14
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,480
Oh, is that like two seconds?

15
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:54,609
This reminds me of those commercials. Like, everybody knows those commercials.

16
00:01:54,609 --> 00:01:57,609
But like the truck that's sitting on the mountain for no reason.

17
00:01:57,609 --> 00:02:02,780
How do they get the truck up there? Like, well, how did I get the truck up here is the real question.

18
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,780
I drove it. But they don't drive it up the mountain.

19
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:09,780
They bring a crane and they drop the truck on the mountain with the crane and like a helicopter or something.

20
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,780
I don't know how they do it. OK, I have no idea.

21
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,780
And they might drive it up the fucking mountain, but I really don't know that.

22
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,780
So let's test my hypothesis right now. Let's drive down the mountain.

23
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:26,780
Let's take our new Ford Tundra 2013 and take it down the goddamn mountain like they would expect you to do if you had one of these cars.

24
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,780
And another thing, let's talk about advertising in general.

25
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:34,780
I'm getting sick and tired of these advertisers. Holy shit.

26
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:43,610
OK, so we made it. Sorry, Ford.

27
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:48,780
I apologize because you can see this like works. Sorry.

28
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:54,740
Honey, this is just an absolutely breathtaking view of San Andreas.

29
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,740
Oh, it's so beautiful. I can't wait to send this to my cat.
