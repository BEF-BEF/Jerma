1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:08,949
Well hello there, happy new year to some of you. At least those of you in EU.

2
00:00:08,949 --> 00:00:17,500
We're not celebrating yet. I'm not ready to celebrate yet. It's only 7.25 pacific time.

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:28,019
I've got time. We're not on my time yet. But hello. We are early. We're going to start soon

4
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:33,130
for about five minutes. I don't want to just go live and then out here I've got the best

5
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:41,350
new character. No, no, no. We're going to take our time. This is going to be a long one.

6
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:49,020
I'm going to tell you right now. Let's just go over a few things while we turn the stream on.

7
00:00:49,579 --> 00:01:02,409
Are you drinking? I drink four times a year. Christmas, New Year's, and weddings. That's it.

8
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:10,120
I can live a little. Early what the fuck? We're pretty early but we're going to just sit here

9
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:18,780
for a few minutes. What I'm about to tell you is, just listen. There are 26 categories this year.

10
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:26,500
Last year I think there were 18. Now some of these categories are fucking stupid, right? Let's be

11
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:34,090
honest. Did Worse Peter really have to be on here this year? Yes. I don't care if I don't say it.

12
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:39,530
It's going to be on here every single year. But there's a lot of categories to go through.

13
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:47,560
And at the same time, there's a whole Germania wrestling event to go through too. There are

14
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,959
eight matches including the Rumble this year. And there are, I believe, at last count,

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,540
55 characters in this year's Rumble. Well, in this year's card. Because obviously you can't

16
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:04,519
have more than 30 people in a Rumble. It's going to get a little weird. It's going to be mayhem.

17
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,580
There are seven matches before the Rumble. We're going to be here all night.

18
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:14,550
That's why I started early so that at 7 30 when people trickle in, we can just fucking get out

19
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:25,340
of here and get started. But hope you're having a good day. Hope you're having a good New Year's

20
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:32,620
Eve. I got like all these characters. I got all these cards in front of me. I'm excited. I'm very

21
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:49,509
excited about this. 7 30. You know, do face cam? Of course I will. I'll be full cam for a huge portion

22
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:58,840
of the stream. You know what I mean? I'm all dressed up too. I dressed up for this. I don't

23
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:07,539
just have a suit jacket on. Do a little fedora. No, no, no. I dressed up today. I'll show you.

24
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:15,379
I'll stand up and I'll show you the whole outfit. You better be in an Among Us costume.

25
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:24,300
You look like shit. I ain't even on camera yet. So you can't even say that. We're getting a ton of

26
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:30,280
community subs. You don't have to be doing this. 25 community subs from ChebIsDead. Thanks for the

27
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:39,289
25 subs. And we have so many. We have five from Juice, five from Skippy, five from Pink, five from

28
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:46,409
Jenny, five from 8bit, 10 from Onymos. All right. Sorry. I'm not going to read these anymore.

29
00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:50,969
No more. I'm not reading any more community subs. I'll just make that really clear.

30
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:57,849
Fourslash just gave 50. No more. I'm not reading any more community subs. You guys are spoiling me.

31
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:04,919
We're not even in the new year yet. Thank you so much, everybody, for the insane amount

32
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,919
of community subs. But I'm no longer going to read them. I'm making that clear,

33
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:18,379
clear as day. He hates his community. No, I love this community. I don't want to see this community

34
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:28,279
go broke. Are you up in fart already? I was thinking about just trying as hard as I could

35
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:37,240
right there. Are we going to watch The Croods? No, I didn't have a plan on watching The Croods

36
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:46,490
today on stream. Why would I watch The Croods? Thanks a lot, everybody. It's unnecessary. You

37
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:54,009
guys are too good to me. Why not? I'm not going to watch The Croods. I don't even want to watch

38
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:59,660
that movie in my off time, let alone on the stream. That's not to say the movie's bad. I

39
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:13,990
just don't. I don't want to watch The Croods. Somebody typed the exact same thing as me. Is

40
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:21,029
that what somebody said? What did you type? I'm actually kind of curious. Are you sure it's not

41
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:28,699
just you on a second account? What about The Croods, too? No, I'm not going to watch either

42
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:38,519
one of those movies. All right. Are you ready? It's 730. I think it's time to begin the festivities.

43
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:45,930
What do you think? I did my hair. Or at least I tried to. Are we ready to begin the festivities?

44
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:55,800
No, hold on. Get a drink. Go get a drink. Go, go, go, go. Hurry up. I'm giving you one minute.

45
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:12,060
One minute. You're down to about 40 seconds, man. You got to pee. Go, go, go. Stop. Oh, stop doing

46
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:18,550
this. That's too much. That's too many community subs. That's way too many. That's enough. No more.

47
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:27,220
No more community subs ever again. After that one. That's a hundred from Repetio. That's enough.

48
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:33,300
That's enough. All right. I'm putting my fork down and I'm putting my knife down at the table.

49
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:42,699
All right. That's enough. You guys ready? Back from the bathroom? That's a shitload of money.

50
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:50,360
Thank you. I don't. Don't stop doing this. Stop doing this. Stop doing it. I demand it. OK,

51
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,959
here we go. I know how to stop this. I've got to get on camera so people can talk about how

52
00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:08,060
well I did my hair today. So let's go ahead and do it. Here we go. Hey, look at me. All right.

53
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:16,019
Told you I dressed up. Told you I... Did I fly up? OK, it is. I got... I have like suit pants on,

54
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:25,800
guys. I'm not messing around. I got my bands. I'm ready. I'm ready for the new year. You look like

55
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,100
you're going through a job interview. I don't think you would wear these at a job interview.

56
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:41,480
That'd be a little weird, I think. I don't know if these would be on. Blue man... Yeah, it's

57
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,839
New Year's. It isn't New Year's. Don't you do blue stuff on New Year's? Or kind of? And guess what I

58
00:07:46,839 --> 00:08:15,379
got? I'll give you a hint. It's a ring light! OK, that's so much. All right, let me explain.

59
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:21,029
The reason... All right, first of all, this says finally 21 on it. I don't know if you can see that.

60
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:31,459
It's 2022. I think that was on clearance somewhere. I'm over 21. But the cup is big enough

61
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:38,779
to fit a whole bottle of champagne. I don't want to be moving around. I don't want to go like

62
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:42,779
up and down and throw it into the refrigerator. No, I'm just... It's right here. I don't need to

63
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:46,379
refill it. Why would I need to refill it? I'm not going to chug it. You're going to make me puke.

64
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:52,820
I needed a glass that could fit the entire bottle of champagne, just in case I needed it. And it's

65
00:08:52,820 --> 00:09:00,230
right here in case I need it. You like the decorations? Look, can you see? You see the

66
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:09,110
glow sticks on the ground? Spill joke? No, I cannot fuck around. This is prop comedy. This is... I'm

67
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:15,700
telling you right now, this is not... This is not prop comedy. I actually wanted this to hold this

68
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:20,259
much. And I know you're only supposed to do like that much, but I don't give a shit. I'm not a prop

69
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:28,169
comedian. If this spills, I'm going to have to like hire a professional cleaner to clean this whole

70
00:09:28,169 --> 00:09:32,789
room. A professional cleaning company is going to have to come in because this is a whole bottle

71
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:41,820
of champagne. All right, I am excited. Are you guys excited to find out some of the things that

72
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:51,370
we've voted on for the last five or six days? I am up right now. I'm very excited. Where's Otto?

73
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:55,769
Otto is in the other room and he's lying down and he's very happy. I didn't want to move him.

74
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:59,259
He's in his Sunday best. You want me to stand up? Should I give you the whole thing?

75
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:17,179
I'll give you the whole thing. I'll give you the whole thing. You, hey, you, yeah. I know you.

76
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:40,340
All right. Messing up. He looks like a youth pastor. Let me tell you about the dangers of alcohol,

77
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:50,899
boys and girls. This is just grape juice. This is grape juice. I've had this shirt since I was

78
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:56,409
like fucking 19 and it still fits. That should be a good thing to all of you. I should be able

79
00:10:56,409 --> 00:11:02,100
to flex that. I've had this shirt since I was like 20. Wow. Do I still have that body? You know what

80
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,500
I'm saying? Even though this is a little big and I got like a pregnant stomach, if I suck that in,

81
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:16,149
well, I'm not going to spill it. All right. First. All right. Listen to me. We've got a lot to do.

82
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:20,230
I can't stall anymore. If you're here, you're here. If you're not, you're not. Welcome to the

83
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:26,570
stream, everybody. A legendary spill joke in the making. Don't even fuck around like an idiot.

84
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,570
We have, we're going to start now. We're going to start, we're going to do like three or four

85
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:35,940
categories. Then we're going to move on to do a couple of matches. And then we're going to kind

86
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:41,289
of go back, bounce back and forth. So the first category we're going to do, this is a good one.

87
00:11:41,289 --> 00:11:44,889
There's so many categories we got to go now. Otherwise I'll be here till four in the morning,

88
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:54,659
Pacific time. What time is it? Bingo. Our first category is best new character.

89
00:11:54,659 --> 00:12:00,759
We've seen a lot of new characters this year considering some of the larger streams that

90
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:06,570
you've seen on this channel. And we can just go ahead and get started. Ladies and gentlemen,

91
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:21,639
here are the nominees for best new character. And I'm joined by Josh from ScienceCenterNevada.org.

92
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:28,679
Josh, good to see you. So, um, I guess as a archeologist, you could probably give us a-

93
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:32,360
Well, wait, wait, wait. This isn't archeology. It's not?

94
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,240
No, we're, we're dealing with rocks. Oh, okay.

95
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,279
Archeology is people stuff. Rock stuff, that's geology.

96
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,860
So this is, this is not archeology? Not at all.

97
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,220
Come on out. Catboy German.

98
00:12:47,500 --> 00:13:08,279
Where, where am I? I need to wink into this. Ow, my head, my brain just hurt.

99
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:19,110
Hi. Hi. I, I'm assuming that you're, you must be the maid. I heard you ordered a sexy maid service.

100
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,860
Why don't you grab a piece of bread? I want you to eat. Well, I've been cleaning. I wouldn't dare

101
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:28,259
touch it with my hands. Right. But if you just, but just eat with wash your hands and then eat.

102
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,860
I'm not putting it in your mouth. Right. No.

103
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:39,340
The name's Amelia. It's Amelia. Amelia. Okay. Amelia. Thank you. I appreciate it.

104
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:43,740
But I need to come out of the shower now. That's a good one already. That's a good one.

105
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:49,259
It's like a little guy. Oh, I'm sorry. Ow, my face.

106
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:52,860
I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to. Don't do that again.

107
00:13:53,580 --> 00:14:05,720
Okay. I won't. Oh, no. My God. Oh, my fucking God.

108
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:14,470
Huh? You want to do what? I don't know. I'm not going out there. What the fuck am I?

109
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,909
Hey there, you're in deep shit. Yeah.

110
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:35,210
How about Strong Henry? Strong Henry Flush. Just fucking break his neck.

111
00:14:36,169 --> 00:14:44,570
Break his fucking neck. Just kill him. You got voted off. You're up. Goodbye. He's done.

112
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:54,539
What? What are you doing? What are you doing?

113
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,379
This is my no, no, no, no, no. Excuse me. This is my house. I'm like,

114
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:08,299
why am I hiding outside of my own house? I'm hiding. I need to eat out of that peanut

115
00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:12,299
butter later. No, I'm not going to. I'm not eating out of that peanut butter.

116
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,399
All right. This is fucked up because I feel like this person is like their boogers just

117
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:23,639
go right into their mouth. That's fucked up. If this person's asleep on the train

118
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:27,000
and they have a runny nose, they're just pooling the runny nose directly into their mouth.

119
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,320
No, this doesn't look like. Oh, my God. This does not. Somebody said this looks like

120
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:38,200
Adam Driver. What are you talking about? How do you see Adam Driver? Adam Driver is like a handsome

121
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:44,330
dashing man. What are you talking about? Dude, that is zoom in on you. I know who had my vote.

122
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:50,649
I know who had my praying mantis baby decided to sit up here and stay here. Take a look.

123
00:15:53,240 --> 00:16:02,659
Look at how look at how big our boy has gotten. He stuck around for the whole four months and then

124
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:36,899
one day he just wasn't there. Oops, we're live. Sorry about that. Oh, yeah. There were a lot of

125
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:43,299
new characters. There's a lot of every his thing about every category had so many nominees.

126
00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:50,580
We had to drop. I'll just tell you, I think there were 200 best and worst noise nominees.

127
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:58,629
How do you even narrow those down? Like it took it took a week straight of narrowing that down.

128
00:16:58,629 --> 00:17:06,329
And there's still like 25 nominees. Anyways, the winner, ladies and gentlemen, of best new character.

129
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:21,990
Let me do that again. With 35% of the vote, ladies and gentlemen, the winner,

130
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:34,890
Catboy Jerma. Amelia came in at second at 18% and the shadow movers at 13%. This also was the

131
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:40,779
least skipped question. Almost everybody, almost everybody answered this. Catboy Jerma. Here you

132
00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:45,980
go. I'll give it to you. Take a look. Best new character, Catboy Jerma. It was a landslide.

133
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:54,859
It was just an absolute landslide. Um, oh well. I like to see when they're close, you know? Oh,

134
00:17:54,859 --> 00:18:05,289
well. I love Catboy Jerma. I voted, I voted for, I voted for Cromwell. All right, we're going to do

135
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:13,829
this one right now because this one's stupid. Cromwell was robbed. Ah, let's fucking go.

136
00:18:13,829 --> 00:18:31,720
I don't even want to do this category. Uh, the next, we're going to go, let's just do it now.

137
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:40,839
The next category is best ooh ooh. And if you don't know what that is, that is the first boss

138
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:48,099
in the Simpsons arcade game. It's a noise that he makes and I just can't stop doing it. Uh, I just

139
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:55,049
can't stop making the sound. So instead of having this show up like 10 times in best and worst noise,

140
00:18:55,049 --> 00:19:01,130
it was just removed and gave its own damn category. I've apparently done this so many times

141
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:08,150
that it had to have its own category. Let's just go. The nominees for best ooh, ah, you know,

142
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:08,869
just, here it is.

143
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:44,660
Here comes a rage stream. Watch out.

144
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:02,940
Can you please spell the sound? It's just ooh. Oh, just spell it.

145
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:16,700
Ooh. Oh, the category is best ooh. I, this is not, I didn't put that for a category.

146
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:28,380
So ladies and gentlemen, the winner. I thought like embarrassed me. I like turned red.

147
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:34,970
Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of best ooh, ah, you, ooh for this, uh, this year.

148
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:50,420
We probably won't be back, but we'll do it for 2021. Wait, that's cute. The winner is,

149
00:20:51,380 --> 00:21:03,180
this is like a three-way tie. I don't even remember which ones these were for a three-way tie

150
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:09,259
pretty much between rage stream, which was the resident evil six one spelling explanation,

151
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:13,579
which is the one where I was explaining it during monster rancher. And then the real voice one were

152
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:24,569
just me saying it. Look at that. It was a 50 vote difference, 25, 25. It's cause it's all the same

153
00:21:24,569 --> 00:21:35,940
sound. It's literal. Hold on. I want, where's real voice. I probably should have had a clip

154
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:44,220
for who won. Who cares? Okay. All right. We'll do one more. Then we're going to get to two more,

155
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:51,140
two more. We got a long way to go. How much was that skipped? No. All right. Coming up next,

156
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:57,019
we have rumble stuff. We have wrestling stuff to do too. So I'm this 26 fucking categories.

157
00:21:57,019 --> 00:22:03,779
Best accident is coming up here. Uh, that includes spelling something. That includes

158
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:08,009
doing something I probably shouldn't have done on camera. There's been a lot of those over the

159
00:22:08,009 --> 00:22:15,500
years. They were quite a few in 2021. So this is for what you have decided was the best accident

160
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:22,890
that has happened on this stream. And surprisingly, one of them didn't make it.

161
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:42,789
We'll find out which one best accident nominees are these juggles. Oh, how do you guys think about

162
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:46,630
that? What do you think? That was a good play. I know what you guys want. I know what you're

163
00:22:46,630 --> 00:23:02,549
looking for. I drank two Gatorades before the stream. This context for the people that don't

164
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:07,990
know what that is. This context, I promise. Does anybody else feel a slight breeze?

165
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:33,579
They saw me having sex with death in my bed. And I just want to say that that's not me. That's not

166
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:38,299
me. That's not who I am. I don't have sex with like three different people and like lie to everybody

167
00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:41,819
as of a week ago. It was three days ago, but that's not me. I'm not. That's not who I am.

168
00:23:43,579 --> 00:24:04,700
I woohooed him. We can't say that word. That's foam. Time for a foam party. But again,

169
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:19,430
this sucked. It got in the eye again. How? How did that happen twice? Spray it in the tub,

170
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:25,509
in the tub, in the tub, inside. How did this happen twice? You know what it looks like? Have

171
00:24:25,509 --> 00:24:32,940
you ever seen those, those optical illusions where it's like the huge guy is standing here

172
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:37,420
and there's like a tiny little person in the corner and it's just like, oh wow, oh my god,

173
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:42,069
this is, and they're in a room and the furniture looks all weird. Like it's because the room is

174
00:24:42,069 --> 00:24:48,619
like 50 feet long and it's like slanted. That's what's going on here. Cause look at, no, I'm

175
00:24:48,619 --> 00:24:56,869
normal person, but when I go back here, I don't know why. I don't understand. It looks so bizarre.

176
00:24:56,869 --> 00:25:02,779
Whatever. People are very, very ignorant of dead ringer spies. They never check and they always

177
00:25:02,779 --> 00:25:09,339
lose their ground. So I get that sniper. I get this scout, pull the dead ringer out. We turn around

178
00:25:09,339 --> 00:25:20,299
and we try and do it again. God damn it. Get the cat, get the cat. Come on, keep going. Move.

179
00:25:20,859 --> 00:25:24,619
You're almost there. You're almost out of the range. You're almost out. You're almost out. You're

180
00:25:24,619 --> 00:25:29,099
almost out. You're almost out. Good, good, good, good. Oh, thank God. Thank God you made it.

181
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:37,900
What does this guy look like? There. All right. There you go. You got what you wanted. Everybody

182
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:44,700
that was here, you got the imposter is fucking stupid ass subspace that you got it. I did. I

183
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,779
just realized that's what I just did. There it is. You've been asking for that for like two hours

184
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:54,579
and I didn't, I just did it. God. See what I'm talking about? This guy just rolled that guy.

185
00:25:54,579 --> 00:26:02,180
That guy just rolled that guy up in a burrito and ate his ass off. That guy just rolled that guy

186
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:10,200
See what I'm talking about? This guy just rolled that guy. That guy just rolled that guy up in a

187
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:18,569
burrito and ate his ass. Ate him. I ate him up. I swallowed him up. I swallowed him up. And I

188
00:26:18,569 --> 00:26:39,289
killed him. There's so many of these. Holy shit. All right. So there's your accident nominees for

189
00:26:39,289 --> 00:26:48,970
best accident. Look at these. Look at how cute these are. The winner for best accident 2021 is

190
00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:56,009
I keep making it. I keep muting the fucking goddamn thing. Have I ever streamed before ever

191
00:26:56,009 --> 00:27:10,019
in my life? It's been like 12 years. The winner. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The juggles zerk with

192
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:16,019
25% of the vote. It was just, all right, listen, but I'm not gonna, let me tell you who the,

193
00:27:16,579 --> 00:27:23,420
let me, let me give some context. I made up this guy named juggles who streams like a streamer.

194
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:28,059
And what he does is he drinks like a bunch of Gatorades and just like goes on IRL just chatting

195
00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:32,710
like we are now. And he fucking shakes his stomach and all like the liquid sounds pick

196
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:38,599
up on his microphone and people like donate money to him and shit. And it looked really,

197
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:42,700
really weird when I did that on camera without the bottom part. There's your context for all

198
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:47,640
the new viewers. There's a lot of people here. In second place, sex with death at 16%. And then

199
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:58,089
cat meteor, cat meteor at 14%. There are your top three. There they are. That one ran away with it

200
00:27:58,089 --> 00:28:02,059
too. We're going to do one more and then we're going to move on to wrestling. I got a lot.

201
00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:08,599
This one's best POG face. Instead of worst face, we added a category called best POG face.

202
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:14,759
Do I even need to run the video for this one? Honest to God, do I, I don't think I, do I even

203
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:19,349
need to, I don't think I have to run the video. I mean, I'm going to because like I, uh, uh,

204
00:28:19,349 --> 00:28:23,750
Dazzle made a bunch of awesome videos for this. But I mean, like, I think it was like 60% of the

205
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:29,769
vote won this. You all know what it is. But just let's watch it. Best POG face of 2021 incoming,

206
00:28:29,769 --> 00:29:07,380
hear it out. That one was pretty good too. I will say too much and I just put a kink in my neck.

207
00:29:08,259 --> 00:29:17,910
Oh, dude, the thing that everybody onion, onion ring. I got an onion ring.

208
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:46,569
Where are my manners? Sonic meat knuckles. Please welcome the chief creative officer

209
00:29:46,569 --> 00:30:07,109
from Epic games. Donald. What happened? Right. Okay. Okay. Drum roll, please.

210
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:17,430
This is fucking crazy. Hey, the winner. This is the, by the way, this is the most,

211
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:23,289
this is the most ever that something has ever won in the four years annually. We've been doing

212
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:28,170
this for, oh, you couldn't hear it. I, I, I took the audio off. Sorry. It was muted. I was doing

213
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:45,779
the drum roll. Fuck. What the fuck, man. Maybe look like an idiot. Okay. With 58% of the vote.

214
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:56,869
That's the highest we've ever seen was the onion ring, the onion ring. Slime rancher two reaction

215
00:30:56,869 --> 00:31:06,279
was 9% and then treasure map was 8%. This is also one of the least skipped questions. 58% of the

216
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:12,630
vote. That's almost everybody. And there were like 20 plus thousand responses or something,

217
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:19,900
at least 18,000 responses. So that's ridiculous. I can't believe that. That's actually crazy.

218
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:24,539
All right. Now we're going to do, we're going to take a small little interlude away from

219
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:31,640
the categories. We got through four. We got a long way to go. We're going to start the

220
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:36,700
Germany event. We're going to do two matches. Then we're going to come back and we're going

221
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:42,380
to do worst face when we come back. So I'm ready to go. Now everybody, I need everyone's collective

222
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:48,569
energy here. Please. Everyone put your hands together and pray. All of you. That this does

223
00:31:48,569 --> 00:31:54,599
not crash. Everybody, we need all of our energy. There's 30,000 people here. I need collective

224
00:31:54,599 --> 00:32:00,099
energy that the game won't crash. Because holy shit, there's like 60 characters inside of this

225
00:32:00,099 --> 00:32:05,539
universe mode right now. And it's really having a, it's, it's struggling a lot. Please pray.

226
00:32:05,539 --> 00:32:17,049
Please pray. I'm going to move this over here. We are about to start. Just give me one second.

227
00:32:17,049 --> 00:32:30,009
Everybody pray. Please pray. Are we praying? Our first matchup is going to be a tag team match.

228
00:32:30,009 --> 00:32:36,500
Can you hear it? Let's hope you can. I think you can. It's going to be a tag team match.

229
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:43,720
You'll see who the entrants are. Let me, everybody pray. You praying?

230
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:57,319
Germania 2021 can help again. There's so many characters this year too. Here we go. It's

231
00:32:57,319 --> 00:33:06,200
loading. It's loading. It's loading. I think we're good. Yes, we are good. Ladies and gentlemen,

232
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:13,930
welcome to Germania 2021. My name is Germa985. How are you? Welcome to the show.

233
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:20,089
We got quite a big one for you here. Eight matches, including the rumble.

234
00:33:21,589 --> 00:33:30,569
Our first match. What the hell is that? Why was it so huge? And why is the Statue of Liberty here?

235
00:33:30,569 --> 00:33:39,579
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I just saved the whole stream. I just saved the entire fucking stream.

236
00:33:39,579 --> 00:33:44,140
It just leaked everything. Everything is on the screen right now. Every match,

237
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:55,559
every participant. I just saved the whole stream. Thank God. Here we go. I can't show the screen

238
00:33:55,559 --> 00:34:00,009
because there's a leak. Holy shit. I'm so glad I did that. That would have been a disaster.

239
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:11,989
Huge thanks. I got to get, wow, this is loading. Tag team match 2v2. I would call this one a scary,

240
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:18,280
scary match. One would call this one a horrifying match. Horrifying.

241
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:26,500
Uh, Opster. I got, here we go. Let's, let's shout everybody out. Opster, Leather Jacket, Kroski,

242
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:33,670
VR Josh. Huge shout out to you guys. Uh, this doesn't happen without them because they made

243
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:38,219
literally fucking everybody. Like I didn't think I was going to be able to get to do a rumble this

244
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:42,469
year because I've been so busy with all this other shit. Everybody seriously like, okay,

245
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:46,150
here we go. Here we go. Huge thanks to those guys. This is literally, this does not happen

246
00:34:46,150 --> 00:35:03,300
unless they do it. So huge thanks. Are you ready? Let's go. Coming up first,

247
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:09,300
we have, uh, Chris Redfield in his, uh, I think that's, uh,

248
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:35,800
in his official, uh, star's uniform. Chris Redfield. Chris R. Chris R. Chris Redfield.

249
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:40,519
Those of you that know, uh, one of the most classic meme videos I think I've ever seen.

250
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:45,849
Now who is Chris Redfield's partner? You're probably asking. You're probably wondering.

251
00:35:46,409 --> 00:35:53,619
Well, that's easy. Was a big fan of Resident Evil 8. Thought it was a potentially game of the year.

252
00:35:54,260 --> 00:36:04,500
Got the Grotto Beast chairs, which is really cool. His partner, Lady Dimitrescu. Lady Dimitrescu.

253
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:21,059
Lady Destro- I think I spelled the name wrong too, by the way. I can't even see the chat now.

254
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:25,699
Shit. My computer crashed. Am I still live? I hope so. I'm going to open up on my phone. I

255
00:36:25,699 --> 00:36:40,420
can see chat on the phone. Yeah. I can see chat on the phone. Oh, hell yeah. Perfect. Yep. I can

256
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:49,639
see chat right here. Perfect. I think, uh, I think Lady Dimitrescu is as big as you can possibly make

257
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:56,789
a wrestler. I think she's like eight feet tall. I have no idea. It's going to be insane. So who

258
00:36:56,789 --> 00:37:01,190
are they fighting against? You're probably wondering. Well, a couple of fan favorites,

259
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:05,739
I think. One in particular is a very large fan favorite. You're not even live. I'm live.

260
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:21,800
Jigsaw. I love how that takes up the whole screen. Jigsaw's 200 pounds. Jigsaw and someone else. And

261
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:37,219
can you guess who that someone else is? Who would be the perfect, terrifying, horrifying partner to

262
00:37:37,219 --> 00:37:43,900
Jigsaw? I'm going to tell you, you're going to have to be careful here. I mean, a lot of us are

263
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:49,539
going to think this is really funny, but money is going to die. And there's nothing I can do about

264
00:37:49,539 --> 00:38:07,960
that, unfortunately. Jigsaw's partner in the tag team match is none other than, then, then, then.

265
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:18,539
WWE 2K likes to do this thing where it loads the next thing. The horror. Don't look at it. Don't

266
00:38:18,539 --> 00:38:30,489
look at it. Don't look at it. It's hilarious. I know, but turn off your screen for a few minutes.

267
00:38:30,489 --> 00:38:37,380
So we've got Lady Demetrius and Banana Chris Redfield versus Jigsaw and the horror in the

268
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:48,940
first match. Just to get us started here. I don't think there's any extreme rules or anything. This

269
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:54,679
is just to get us going because there's too many characters. I am going to say we could probably

270
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:58,760
get predictions going too if we want on some of these matches. I would start it now if you could.

271
00:39:00,139 --> 00:39:11,380
Horror. I am peeping hard. And here we go, ladies and gentlemen, the first match.

272
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:30,179
I feel the power. Chris Redfield, Jigsaw, tag team match and begin. Welcome. So if you want to

273
00:39:30,179 --> 00:39:36,179
look at everybody's stats, everybody is pretty much in the same stat category. Some people are

274
00:39:36,179 --> 00:39:40,389
stronger than others, obviously, because they are stronger than others. Jigsaw's starting to get

275
00:39:40,389 --> 00:39:45,829
off with it. Chris Redfield is barely even doing it. Going to tag out already. Peeping the horror

276
00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:51,989
at the very first 5 to 10 seconds. Not confident. Oh, the horror with a horrific kick to the stomach

277
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:57,019
as he pummels into Chris Redfield's midsection, going down to a knee.

278
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:03,320
Now, the tag rules apply here. You cannot come into the ring unless you're tagged in.

279
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:12,940
Otherwise, you're disqualified. I need to start making referees. Big bear hug here by the horror

280
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:24,900
on Chris Redfield. Did he just tap out? I hope not. With a thunder clap to the ears. Oh, my god,

281
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,099
the horror does not care at all. Going to go for the next snap. No, he's going to go for the ear,

282
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:34,889
right ear scrunch. Maybe a power bomb. No, spinning neck breaker from the horror.

283
00:40:35,829 --> 00:40:39,829
Lady Demetrious goes for the tag. Here we go. Now, this is an even match. We've got Lady Demetrious.

284
00:40:39,829 --> 00:40:49,369
Oh, no. Caught it. Both enormous wrestlers. Lady Demetrious, I think, is the highest you

285
00:40:49,369 --> 00:40:54,340
can possibly make a wrestler. A horror might be as well. Jigsaw going to come in and wants

286
00:40:54,340 --> 00:41:01,000
to play a little game here. How do you even do a move to somebody this much bigger?

287
00:41:03,429 --> 00:41:11,019
I guess like that. Chris Redfield's out on the outside. There are rules in this fight.

288
00:41:14,699 --> 00:41:20,980
I love where the banana is on Chris Redfield. It's perfect. Jigsaw is really timid.

289
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:28,150
Honestly, I would do the same thing. Why would you ever fight when you have this demonic,

290
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:34,650
otherworldly, godlike character that can just go in? The two humans are letting the two demon

291
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:40,889
people fight, which is, I think, a great strategy. I'm going over to the ropes.

292
00:41:40,889 --> 00:41:45,159
Going to go to the top rope. Did she get it? She got it. Chris Redfield in the ring now.

293
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:58,329
Horror up on the turnbuckle. I'm an idiot. Why would you do that? Knee to the face.

294
00:41:59,739 --> 00:42:09,050
He's throwing. I know. What the hell? Big right hand by Chris Redfield. Caught it. We got momentum

295
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:15,420
here from Banana Chris Redfield. Setting him up to a seated position. Going to go for the...

296
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:20,139
Going to go for the... I don't even know what this is. I don't even want to say what I think

297
00:42:20,139 --> 00:42:27,769
it is. I don't know. He was like squishing his head. He's going to do it again? No, he's going

298
00:42:27,769 --> 00:42:35,210
for that CQC that he learned at the Starz training facility. No, no. He's bumping into

299
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:46,679
and attacking Lady Dimitrisu. Horror is in a bad place right now. Lady Dimitrisu's got him in a

300
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:56,579
crab. Will we see a tap out from the horror? I hope not. Oh, it's going to be close. No, big

301
00:42:56,579 --> 00:43:10,840
reversal by the horror. Momentum shift incoming possibly here. Oh, he's grabbing it by the face.

302
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:16,280
She's peeping. She's peeping the horror right now. That's all she can see. That's it.

303
00:43:17,739 --> 00:43:28,500
No, wait a minute. Oh, big reversal. She's got him. Almost threw him over the top rope. What a

304
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:35,750
huge comeback. What an absolutely insane reversal. No way. Huge. Absolutely massive.

305
00:43:36,309 --> 00:43:45,179
You don't peep the horror and live. Although a little bit of a reversal here. Chris Redfield

306
00:43:45,179 --> 00:43:49,179
may be going to go for some kind of tomfoolery on the top ropes here. No, Jigsaw's coming in.

307
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:58,420
He just tagged him into pin. What are you doing, Jigsaw? What are you thinking?

308
00:44:01,449 --> 00:44:19,559
Oh, we're going to see a breather here. No. Punching her in the stomach, but it did not

309
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:28,070
faze her at all. She is a demon. Jigsaw's just a guy in a suit and it's not even a guy. It's a

310
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:34,250
little toy thing. This match is going longer than I thought it was too. This is actually pretty

311
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:43,719
exciting. Big toss across the ring. I wonder if we're going to go see a finishing move here.

312
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:54,539
No, let's see. He's telling him to leave it alone, Ethan. Yep. I think he's getting ready to use.

313
00:44:54,539 --> 00:45:00,900
You better leave it alone, Ethan. I think he's right here. He's going to go for it. Why does he

314
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:10,900
keep doing the same move? He just keeps kicking him in the chest. The horror is reaching so

315
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:19,210
desperately and it cannot reach even though he's huge. Oh, no. German suplex number one.

316
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:27,269
German suplex number two. German suplex number three. You're not getting up from that one.

317
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:39,420
Just destroyed. Oh, reversal. Got to get him out of there. Yeah. Jigsaw's got to get out or it's over.

318
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:53,349
No, he broke it away. I love how Chris Redfield just kicks people. He just puts them on the ground

319
00:45:53,349 --> 00:45:58,199
and kicks them in the back of the head. No, no. Trying to go for that submission move.

320
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:05,510
Jigsaw is throwing right now. Jigsaw is pretty weak. This is really balanced right now because

321
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:08,469
Peep the Horror is really, really powerful. Going for the armbar. Is he going to get it?

322
00:46:10,519 --> 00:46:20,440
No. Hold on for dear life, Jigsaw. Can you do it? Can you stay or is it over? No help from horror.

323
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:27,369
Peep the Horror doesn't even care. All the while, Demetrius is getting health increases as well.

324
00:46:27,369 --> 00:46:30,969
Recovering lots of damage. Going for another one. Going for that. Going for another armbar.

325
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:36,550
That's all. The horror. Broke it up. Beautiful play by the horror. You can't let that happen.

326
00:46:37,269 --> 00:46:40,949
He's a trained military professional. You can't let him do those moves.

327
00:46:40,949 --> 00:46:53,079
It's over if you do. What is going on? That could be it. There's one. There's two.

328
00:46:53,880 --> 00:47:03,699
Oh, that was close. Was that it? No, he didn't get it. He didn't do three. He only, what's going on?

329
00:47:03,699 --> 00:47:10,579
He only did two. He did two and a half. Chris Redfield on the top rope. Okay. Okay, just pin

330
00:47:10,579 --> 00:47:17,820
him. Pin him and let's get over, get it on with. Give me a fucking break. Yes. You know, there's a

331
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:24,010
match to win. There's a match to win and he's on the ground right now for you to pin. But apparently

332
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:28,949
you don't care about that. Chris Redfield just going for some taunting and that's going to be

333
00:47:28,949 --> 00:47:33,190
the downfall. Could have had the victory right there. Jigsaw now doing the same terrible move

334
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:39,639
he did earlier, which is a series of really weak punches to the chest, which don't even hurt.

335
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:48,599
It's the equivalent of when a little kid throws like a magic wand at you and you pretend like it

336
00:47:48,599 --> 00:48:02,409
hurt to make them laugh. Exact same scenario. What is going on here? Why are they going outside?

337
00:48:02,809 --> 00:48:16,650
There's no count outs. Oh, there is count outs. What are you doing outside? He's just grabbing

338
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:31,449
his head. Submissions do not happen outside. Even if it works, he could hurt him. I think a count

339
00:48:31,449 --> 00:48:40,380
out is 10, I believe. This is bad. Get back in the ring, Harv. What are you doing? Oh, this is

340
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:46,550
going to be it. That's it. That's it. He's going to get counted out. The referee's slowing the

341
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:53,190
countdown apparently. That was the longest eight I think I've ever seen in the entire time I played

342
00:48:53,190 --> 00:49:00,869
these games. Why are you out here counting yourself out? Is this double elimination? Two?

343
00:49:02,389 --> 00:49:20,170
What are you talking about? That was bullshit. That was so messed up. Why did he start the count

344
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:29,030
over? The horror is not in good shape. He thinks he's out of energy. Jigsaw does not even want to

345
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:36,250
put a hand out. This is a bad team situation here. He won't even put a hand out. Bad blood

346
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:40,329
forming here between horror and Jigsaw while Chris Redfield's got him in a power bomb.

347
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:51,239
That's bad. Quadruple power bomb. Unless Jigsaw does something about this, this is the end here.

348
00:49:52,949 --> 00:50:03,380
That's it. One, two. Finally, Jigsaw decides to do something. He doesn't even care about anything

349
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:10,139
else in the whole match. Oh, that's it. That's it. He's got him. He's got him. He's got him.

350
00:50:10,139 --> 00:50:15,159
There's no way the horror. That's it. Game over. Chris Redfield, ladies and gentlemen, got him

351
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:23,699
in the arm bar. I told you he was militarily trained. You got to watch out for that one.

352
00:50:23,699 --> 00:50:27,380
I don't know what they were doing in the outside. It was stupid. Why would they not count?

353
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:39,619
That was really strange. There are your winners. Chris Redfield and Lady Demetrius. Sorry, sorry,

354
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:51,820
hold on. Demetrius. Weird that they did. Oh, they're getting booed. This is a huge boo.

355
00:50:54,949 --> 00:51:00,550
All right. We're going to move on to the next match really quickly. We're going to do two

356
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:03,989
because there are eight matches, so we've got to get through these. We're going to move right

357
00:51:03,989 --> 00:51:09,050
onto the next one. I don't want any spoilers, so we're going to go back to full cam here for

358
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:14,570
just a second. That was kind of an upset. I think a lot of people expected the horror to win that.

359
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:20,309
Let me go like this real quick. Hopefully, this doesn't crash. I hope not. Please,

360
00:51:20,309 --> 00:51:23,429
God. I know I've seen a lot of boos. Yeah, a lot of you guys are not happy about that.

361
00:51:24,309 --> 00:51:31,500
All right, next match. We're going to keep moving forward. This one's going to be wacky.

362
00:51:35,699 --> 00:51:44,260
Uh, I get to see it. You don't. Here comes a payout. Yeah, if you bet on that, then yeah.

363
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:58,250
Why does he have a urinal in the side, in the corner of his room? It's like a fan, man. It

364
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:07,320
gets hot in here. It's Las Vegas. It's a fan. All right, the next one coming up is a four-way

365
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:15,769
extreme rules match. Anything goes, any weapon, any way to beat your opponent. I'm looking

366
00:52:15,769 --> 00:52:20,150
forward to this one. This one's going to be fun. Here we go. Ladies and gentlemen, match two of

367
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:35,750
Drew Many at 2021 is incoming just as fast as this year went, it seems. Here we go.

368
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:46,280
Fatal four-way. Uh, this one is, uh, first contestant is Armin, Aaron Armlet.

369
00:52:53,559 --> 00:53:00,940
So good. Uh, we have Armin from Attack on Titan. You might be able to guess what this fatal four-way

370
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:11,610
is, maybe after the next contestant. Uh, but yeah, we have Armin, Aaron Arlet as the first

371
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:22,579
contestant. I love this character so much. Somebody got it already. I'm surprised that you,

372
00:53:22,579 --> 00:53:33,449
uh, could call it already. This is the battle of the sounds. We've already seen one of these

373
00:53:33,449 --> 00:53:47,139
categories this year. No spoilers, but it's the battle of the sounds. The next contestant coming

374
00:53:47,139 --> 00:54:11,690
up, Lala dog. Lala. That is their name. That is actually technically their name. Don't try this

375
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:19,079
at home. Please don't. You're going to get hurt. So we have Aaron, Lala, and who else could be in

376
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:32,090
this fatal four-way of the sound effects from 2021? That's the worst character. Yeah. I mean,

377
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:38,469
they're all pretty bad. They're all the worst character. I actually think they are. I think

378
00:54:38,469 --> 00:54:46,389
they turned out great. Everybody in the whole, every rumble is, whoa, every rumble is worst

379
00:54:46,389 --> 00:55:01,000
character. The hell was that? Who is the third contestant? Let's find out right now in our battle

380
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:11,460
of the sound effects. Lala is pissed at this entrance. Who is it? All the way from the

381
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:22,860
Simpsons, the Simpsons arcade game. This is actually their name. It's Warner Van Braun or something.

382
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:32,739
It's the oon or oon guy. It's the first boss of the Simpsons arcade game. Still one more person to

383
00:55:32,739 --> 00:55:53,030
go. No, it's, are you, people are hooing Warner right now? Are you kidding me? We're getting a lot

384
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:58,599
of hoo mega lols right now. That, that's not, what are you talking about? This is where that,

385
00:55:58,599 --> 00:56:09,190
this is the oon or oon guy. This is the guy that makes that noise. How dare you? Our final

386
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:14,170
contestant I think is going to really make people a little angry. Some of you are expecting somebody

387
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:28,199
else and that's not who you're getting. Who you are getting is oops. It's the wrong outfit.

388
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:33,400
It's the Tasmanian devil. It's the wrong outfit though. I put, I put the wrong outfit on.

389
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:37,909
Uh, they're, they are going to look a little different when they're in the ring,

390
00:56:37,909 --> 00:56:51,210
but it's the Tasmanian devil. It's, no, I promise it's not the worst character. I screwed up.

391
00:56:51,210 --> 00:57:01,780
I messed up and I'm, I, it won't be there. Make each sound? No. Welcome to Tasmanian devil. This

392
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:06,820
is the battle of the sound effects. Uh, the sound effects I probably did the most this year. Besides

393
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:15,429
doi doi doi, doi doi doi robbed. Well, that's too bad. Wait till 2022 is rumble. Uh, there are no

394
00:57:15,429 --> 00:57:20,730
rules in this match. You can hurt each other as much as you want, which I mean, who really cares?

395
00:57:21,449 --> 00:57:29,050
Hopefully somebody throws a fucking table at somebody's head. We have Armin, the la la dog.

396
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:40,860
And the Tasmanian devil. There we go. There it is. Hardcore match. Bring it on. Nothing

397
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:46,519
matters here. It's just a battle to the death. The first person I, is it, I don't think it's

398
00:57:46,519 --> 00:57:52,579
elimination. I think it's just whoever pins wins. I'm not sure you can do predictions on this one

399
00:57:52,579 --> 00:57:56,500
either. Oh, already outside the ring, la la dog. The two animals are fighting outside.

400
00:57:57,059 --> 00:58:02,869
It's bizarre that the la la dog can handle the Tasmanian devil considering the la la dog is,

401
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:10,150
I'd say 150 pounds lighter than a Tasmanian devil. Maybe not. You're not going to end it already,

402
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:18,659
are you? No. La la dog, I would say was worst, most hated sound effect I did when I first did it.

403
00:58:19,219 --> 00:58:24,820
And turned out to be everyone's fan favorite now. Uh, it gets requested. He's breaking Armin's neck.

404
00:58:26,969 --> 00:58:31,929
I get requested to do la la more than any sound effect. And all you hated it when I first did it,

405
00:58:31,929 --> 00:58:39,769
so. Sorry that, you know, you need to trust me. I thought he was going to punch the referee in

406
00:58:39,769 --> 00:58:44,070
the face. And out goes Tasmanian devil to the outside of the ring. Now we're going to, ooh.

407
00:58:47,429 --> 00:58:52,309
I'm sorry. If I get to, it's 2022 in like four hours. Let me have this for like another hour or

408
00:58:52,309 --> 00:58:57,510
two. Just for like another hour. I promise I'll try not to ever do these sounds ever again.

409
00:58:57,510 --> 00:59:00,869
This is my way to get it out of my system and never think about it again. So let me just get

410
00:59:00,869 --> 00:59:12,119
over it. I'm hoping we see some weapons here. Maybe Armin might take out his, uh, his. God,

411
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:15,480
I've seen the anime and I know everything about it. I just don't know what they're called.

412
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:17,960
The stuff that they wear when they attach it to trees and they fly around.

413
00:59:18,519 --> 00:59:23,000
There's an O. Oh, he's going for it. What's he going to get? He's got himself a stick.

414
00:59:23,559 --> 00:59:27,880
And he missed completely. Missed completely again. Armin was never a fighter.

415
00:59:28,519 --> 00:59:32,599
Armin was always, uh, the brains and the strategist. He was never the one that picked

416
00:59:32,599 --> 00:59:42,969
up the sword. Two complete whiffs. We're paying a lot of attention to outside, but not the inside

417
00:59:42,969 --> 00:59:50,889
and what's happening. They keep just throwing each other. Big pot. Holy shit. Oh my God.

418
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:55,849
He just threw him across the ring. Going under is actually, is ooh, ooh,

419
00:59:55,849 --> 00:59:58,329
going to get something from under the ring. Is it going to be a bat?

420
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:03,369
Is it going to be a, what are you doing? You can't find what it's, what are you stupid?

421
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:08,619
There's like a hundred items under there. He's got a bat. He's got a bat.

422
01:00:08,619 --> 01:00:20,019
Oh my God. Useless. Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Ooh.

423
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:26,840
You gave him a neck massage for 15 seconds. Oh no. Don't let him win right now, please.

424
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:45,460
Armin's got the kendo stick. I think he hit him both. I don't know. Armin, you're supposed to,

425
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:53,260
come on Armin. You're not supposed to be aggressive like that. Two weapons in the

426
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:57,820
ring right now and ooh, ooh, ooh on the Lala dog. Now on top punching him in the face over and over

427
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:06,650
again. While the Tasmanian devil's in the corner and Aaron. Oh, big move by Aaron. Armin, whatever.

428
01:01:10,519 --> 01:01:17,510
I think we're going to see potentially some weapon usage here. Oh, he missed. Big whiff

429
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:22,070
right there on the Tasmanian devil. Kicks him into the groin, I think. Big clothesline by Armin.

430
01:01:22,789 --> 01:01:30,820
Oh, the dog has a weapon. No, doesn't want to use it. He tripped. I think he just tripped over it.

431
01:01:36,579 --> 01:01:44,650
Reverse chin breaker there. Big DDT. Now you got to hit him in the head with the bat and then you

432
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:50,070
got to pin him. Everyone's so tired right now. But no, take him all the way across.

433
01:01:52,139 --> 01:01:57,340
Go into the corner and nice move. All right, Tasmanian devil's got the bat now.

434
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:02,550
Lala going for the pin. Tasmanian devil not going to let that happen.

435
01:02:04,949 --> 01:02:07,909
I think there are tables under the ring too. So I don't know what they're going to do.

436
01:02:10,099 --> 01:02:16,519
Big scoop slam. I think this ladder is this tables. There's all kinds of crazy shit under

437
01:02:16,519 --> 01:02:22,889
the ring. It looks like Lala might be going to get something. And that was way softer than I

438
01:02:22,889 --> 01:02:27,929
thought it was going to be. And they make a table tower. I think they can do something like that.

439
01:02:30,010 --> 01:02:35,449
Everybody is so tired. Ooh, ooh, ooh has a big advantage here. If he can get Tas on the ground,

440
01:02:35,449 --> 01:02:45,619
I think this is it. This actually could be it. Now Armin's back up. Got the weapon again.

441
01:02:47,269 --> 01:02:51,909
Oh, this is so dumb. Just keep the weapon with you. Carry it with you. Finally somebody just

442
01:02:51,909 --> 01:03:03,750
hold on to it. Don't put it on the ground. Did he miss? Oh shit. Oh, he is just going rage mode on

443
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:14,579
Werner right now. That could be it. No, throw him out of the ring. He's got a bone to pick with him

444
01:03:14,579 --> 01:03:19,829
right now for some reason. I don't know why. Armin now searching for something. He's got a

445
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:30,440
ladder. Ladder going into the ring. Where is Tas? Oh, outside. Okay. There it is. Ladder getting

446
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:35,539
set up. I wonder, Armin, could we could see some theatrics here? He's thinking about what he wants

447
01:03:35,539 --> 01:03:39,780
to do. He might put it up and jump off out to the outside of the ring, which would be insane.

448
01:03:40,659 --> 01:03:48,309
But it looks like he's stuck. His brain got frozen for a second. Those of you that want to know the

449
01:03:48,309 --> 01:03:53,510
AI in these WWE games is about the intelligence level of a baby squirrel.

450
01:03:55,429 --> 01:04:00,710
It's some of the worst. They're just so brain dead. Big. Oh my God. That was a huge move by the

451
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:12,780
Tasmanian devil. Break this up. Break it up. He almost just won it right there. Werner going

452
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:18,489
under the ring now. Oh, that's a steel chair. This is going to put somebody in the hospital.

453
01:04:18,489 --> 01:04:31,739
He's going to put him in the hospital. Lala outside. Not getting up. Werner trying to find

454
01:04:31,739 --> 01:04:34,780
his next target, his next victim. It's going to be the Tasmanian devil right in the head. Steel

455
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:41,849
chair shot right in the forehead. Now what? He's wedging the chair into the corner. This could get

456
01:04:41,849 --> 01:04:53,159
ugly. No, he's going to fit him. No, not even close. Somebody's going to run into that chair

457
01:04:53,159 --> 01:05:08,599
accidentally. I love when they use the weapons. It's so stupid. I don't know who's going to win

458
01:05:08,599 --> 01:05:13,320
this. He's going for a sharpshooter. You got to break that up. This could be a tap out right now.

459
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:22,780
Break it up, Lala. Nice job. Sludge hammer. Armand's got a sludge hammer. Didn't know who

460
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:33,639
to use it on. What the fuck was that? What was that? Why did he just do that? What the hell was

461
01:05:33,639 --> 01:05:44,340
that? He just screamed at him. And now he's got like streamers on his back. What is going on?

462
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:56,219
He's got caught. Oh, he's going full sick almost. Do falls count anywhere? I don't think they do.

463
01:05:56,860 --> 01:06:03,829
I read that from chat, by the way, so don't be mad at me if you didn't think it was funny. I read

464
01:06:03,829 --> 01:06:15,530
that from chat. Where's the chair? That's a good question. I think Lala's going to put it away here.

465
01:06:20,579 --> 01:06:28,570
No, they're all so tired. If anybody goes for a pin, that's it. Armand's getting a little pumped

466
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:36,739
up here. I say go for the bat, hit him in the head, and then cover him. No, he's just choking

467
01:06:36,739 --> 01:06:41,210
him with his boot on his tooth for stealing content. I didn't, what are you talking about?

468
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:52,409
I read that. I hope Armand loses. Well, you might see your opportunity right here.

469
01:06:53,369 --> 01:07:11,940
Oh, everyone's back in the ring again. Cover him. Pin him. Cover him. This is it. Oh, no.

470
01:07:12,739 --> 01:07:19,159
Not quite. He can't believe it either. He's so shocked. He can't believe it.

471
01:07:21,739 --> 01:07:39,960
All right. Armand, get up. No. Is this it? How is this going to end? Weapon.

472
01:07:40,679 --> 01:07:45,960
Cas stole, stole it from Armand, but watch out for the, I don't even know what to even say. They

473
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:51,960
all have weapons. That's all you need to know. Stop putting the weapons on the ground.

474
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:06,789
There are three weapons on the ground. Just pick one up. You don't have to steal it from the other

475
01:08:06,789 --> 01:08:20,899
person. Big clothesline. I think that could be the end. It's not the end. Just pin him.

476
01:08:21,539 --> 01:08:36,220
Stop being so stupid. What are you doing? Why would you walk away from that? Big reversal.

477
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:44,869
Hit him once and it's over. Double reversal. Triple reversal. Just hit him.

478
01:08:47,449 --> 01:08:59,420
Pin him. Please pin him, Armand. Pin him, please. Please pin somebody. Pin someone.

479
01:09:03,619 --> 01:09:15,289
Toss him out of the ring, for God's sake. That move doesn't even hurt. I've jumped into a hotel bed

480
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:19,770
harder than that. It doesn't hurt. There's nothing wrong with what you just did.

481
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:28,619
Chug him out. Chug him out. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. No.

482
01:09:29,579 --> 01:09:42,920
Where's Armand? Oh, he's outside. Outside. These are spoilers for Attack on Titan.

483
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:49,699
I don't know what just happened, but that could be it. Too busy getting a weapon and he's going

484
01:09:49,699 --> 01:09:58,100
to lose. That's it. That's definitely it. As he gets a table. No, that's it. Werner von Braun

485
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:02,340
from the Simpsons Arcade Game, ladies and gentlemen, is your sound of the whatever.

486
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:09,159
It's one of the sounds I've made last year. One of the many sounds I've made.

487
01:10:17,369 --> 01:10:25,270
Very nice match. Congratulations to Werner. I get to do it one more time

488
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:28,340
and I won't do it ever again for the rest of the year. I promise.

489
01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:41,060
I won't do that ever again. You'll never hear me make that sound ever again. One more. Wait,

490
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:50,600
one more. One more. One more. Okay. I'll never do it ever again. All right. Let's get back to

491
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:58,810
some categories. That was two matches. We still have six more to do, including the rumble.

492
01:10:58,810 --> 01:11:04,579
We're going to go over here for now. I hope it does not crash. I'll be very sad if it does.

493
01:11:04,579 --> 01:11:16,380
We're going to leave it. I'm going to be incredibly upset if it crashes. Cross your fingers and pray.

494
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:18,859
All right. We've got some categories. The next one we're going to do, we're going to go through.

495
01:11:18,859 --> 01:11:24,539
This is worst face incoming. If you're new to the channel, worst face is usually a category that.

496
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:32,819
And when I'm in the corner, when I do my face cam, have you noticed that when I put face cam on,

497
01:11:32,819 --> 01:11:38,739
every time I've had face cam, there's been a nominee for this. Anytime I put my face cam on,

498
01:11:38,739 --> 01:11:46,520
people nominate a worst face that I've made. They range from excited to angry to like blowing

499
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:53,289
bubbles or something. I don't know, whatever it is. So these are your nominees for worst face

500
01:11:53,289 --> 01:12:10,840
of the year. What does this guy look like? There. All right. There you go. You got what you wanted,

501
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:17,560
everybody that was here. You got the imposter is fucking stupid ass sus face that you got it.

502
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:19,159
I didn't, I just realized that's what I just did.

503
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:33,560
Somebody came in the room. The T-Rex walked in. It didn't matter what I was doing. I had to be

504
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:42,020
very still or I was dead. Or you don't have a place to put your cardboard cutout of German 985.

505
01:12:42,659 --> 01:12:46,819
I guess it's going to go over here and lean against the wall while I clean the fucking room.

506
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:50,340
There's 50 subs. I missed 50 subs. Well, thank you.

507
01:12:50,340 --> 01:13:04,409
You. Oh, that one was bad. It looks like somebody's like fucking threatening me to like,

508
01:13:04,409 --> 01:13:11,720
like, yeah, you're not dense. Doesn't it look like somebody's going to fucking kill me off camera?

509
01:13:15,659 --> 01:13:20,220
Oh, my funny bone. Oh, my funny bone. My funny bone. I just hit my funny bone and my arm is dumb.

510
01:13:29,210 --> 01:13:37,899
Hainsaw sucks. What do we do? What do we do with him? You decide. What do we do with him?

511
01:13:37,899 --> 01:13:44,970
What do we do with him? What do we do with him? I just went like cross-eyed.

512
01:13:44,970 --> 01:13:50,970
What? What? What do we do with that guy? What do we do with him? What do we do with that guy?

513
01:13:51,859 --> 01:14:04,630
Doesn't want me to do it. Just sit there. You have a huge inventory in this game. That's good.

514
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:21,270
It's like, oh, that guy is. Oh, wait a minute. I'm trying to get. I'm trying to get it.

515
01:14:28,199 --> 01:14:32,359
Like, somebody snatched me. Somebody snatched me. I was in the middle and like,

516
01:14:32,359 --> 01:14:35,399
before they took the photo, somebody like fucking snatched me and pulled me.

517
01:14:38,979 --> 01:14:55,350
Some good ones this year. So the winner of the worst face of the year. I actually don't know.

518
01:14:55,350 --> 01:15:00,539
I don't remember who won this. I don't know who won this. We're going to find out together.

519
01:15:10,170 --> 01:15:16,890
It was close, but Eye Contact Whopper Bite was number one with 22%.

520
01:15:24,869 --> 01:15:27,909
Eye Contact Whopper Bite with 22% of the vote.

521
01:15:28,859 --> 01:15:36,250
Cartoon Anger and Accidental Susface are your winners. Hey, I made some deity very angry.

522
01:15:37,579 --> 01:15:47,300
Eye Contact Whopper. 22% of the vote, which I can. I get it. I can understand. Nobody likes to watch

523
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:53,670
other people eat and nobody likes to have eye contact while somebody else eats. I don't. I can't.

524
01:15:54,920 --> 01:16:02,489
I get it. I really do. I hate sitting across from somebody and we both have dinners in front of us

525
01:16:02,489 --> 01:16:08,710
and we're both eating. I like, oh no, fucking get out of it. Let's go somewhere else.

526
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:12,819
I just want to just get takeout and sit on the couch. I don't fucking want to go to a

527
01:16:12,819 --> 01:16:17,300
goddamn restaurant. The only time I like going to a restaurant seriously is if there's like

528
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:22,420
eight people and everyone's like, oh, did you try this? Try the lobster. Oh yeah. Did you get any

529
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:26,260
of that? Hey, you got to try this drink. And like you, you, you, it's everyone's just talking and

530
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:31,609
yelling at each other and shit. I like going to a restaurant with like six people. It was sweating.

531
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:43,270
Holy fucking moly. Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. I got to get this off. Jesus Christ. What? What

532
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:53,460
happened? What happened? I got to get this off. I got to get this off. What happened? What happened?

533
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:58,170
What's going on recently? I've been sweating my ass off. Hold on. Let me turn on my urinal.

534
01:16:58,899 --> 01:17:14,149
Let me turn the urinal on. I think I need it. Turn the urinal on. Jesus

535
01:17:19,399 --> 01:17:26,819
God. Turn on your face. I just turned it on. Look, all right. I'm sitting. Look, let me explain.

536
01:17:26,819 --> 01:17:31,960
I'm sitting down in a chair and I'm like, I'm sweating and shit. Like I got this ring light

537
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:35,800
now. I got this new ring light. I'm in like full lighting. This is not like a normal scenario. I'm

538
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:42,250
out at a dinner table with six people having fun. Anyways, there's your winner. But no, I like going

539
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:47,289
to a restaurant with like five or six people. You get to converse. You get to share. You get to talk.

540
01:17:47,369 --> 01:17:53,689
You get to point at the person all the way at the end. Hey, oh, dude, did you try the chicken thighs?

541
01:17:53,689 --> 01:17:58,409
And they go, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. And you go, yeah, man, that's my guy over there in the corner.

542
01:17:58,409 --> 01:18:05,260
I like that environment. I hate the other environment. I'm sweating, so who cares?

543
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:12,119
Going up next is best dancing. Sometimes I get on camera and I decide to move a little bit,

544
01:18:12,119 --> 01:18:17,539
shake a little bit. What do you want about? Those that get it, get it. Those that don't,

545
01:18:17,539 --> 01:18:26,300
they never will. So this is for the best dancing of the year. I don't know even how many times I've

546
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:31,100
danced this year total. We're about to find out. And no, I swear to God, I'm not a lizard person.

547
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:37,909
I just blinked weird for a second. All right, these are the nominees for best dancing of the year.

548
01:18:37,909 --> 01:18:41,300
I actually forget what was nominated. Let's find out.

549
01:18:52,010 --> 01:18:55,689
All right, there's a guy right now going like this, like way in the back.

550
01:18:56,409 --> 01:19:07,579
There's a guy just like fucking freaking out over there. There's something, there's always like

551
01:19:07,579 --> 01:19:10,380
bending down too. You know, like it's always just like, it's like,

552
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:16,789
it's like, and their hair is like going fucking crazy.

553
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:20,470
You didn't even let me choreograph this with me. I wasn't here at the rehearsal.

554
01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:57,850
Oh, whatever. I'm tired. I'm done. Okay. I've trended on TikTok three different times in the

555
01:19:57,850 --> 01:20:04,970
last fucking three years. Okay. Bring this one to the fucking front page. Oh, this one,

556
01:20:04,970 --> 01:20:14,710
the goddamn orangutan. I'm sweaty as hell on this one too. Why am I sweating so much?

557
01:20:15,350 --> 01:20:19,430
I swear to God, this is like a new thing for the last six months. Why am I so sweaty now?

558
01:20:19,430 --> 01:20:28,869
I want them to see me Fortnite dancing before they die. Come on. They need to see this before

559
01:20:28,869 --> 01:20:45,979
they go. Oh my God. That was epic. I'll give you the shake. It's the old fucking 36 year old shake.

560
01:20:46,779 --> 01:21:01,939
The guy that paid $1,200 for a front row seat.

561
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:23,189
Okay. This is going to put the TV down for a second. Go have a good day. Go ahead. Take it.

562
01:21:23,189 --> 01:21:26,390
I'm not paying. Fine. You can take it. I don't know if you've heard of that Tic-Tac or whatever.

563
01:21:26,390 --> 01:21:30,949
Keep going. Don't talk to me. Don't talk to me. Fine. But I gotta do it. Are you tick talking?

564
01:21:31,590 --> 01:21:34,710
Are you tick talking now? Uh, yeah, I think so. I don't know how it works.

565
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:45,270
It mills them in the back. It's so fucking late. Please. All right. All right. I'm the one in

566
01:21:45,270 --> 01:21:54,710
handcuffs, bro. And he took us all by the hand. And then we started dancing.

567
01:21:55,750 --> 01:21:59,189
And then we started dancing.

568
01:22:00,710 --> 01:22:08,949
It's got the spirit. Remix. Remix. When God came down to the land in the land.

569
01:22:08,949 --> 01:22:14,710
God came down to the land in the land. I can't believe what's happening right now.

570
01:22:14,710 --> 01:22:17,189
I can't believe what's happening right now.

571
01:22:22,010 --> 01:22:26,739
Somebody said something really, really important. And I have to address it because I'm going to

572
01:22:26,739 --> 01:22:31,300
address these things. And yeah, I've taken it off a little bit. I don't want to see my sweat box.

573
01:22:32,710 --> 01:22:38,310
Somebody said something really important. They said, I love how Derma's interpretation of dancing

574
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:49,989
is doing different poses. I mean, what even is dancing? Dancing is just doing different

575
01:22:50,069 --> 01:22:55,670
poses in succession to make a new animation, like a new human animation. How is that? How's

576
01:22:55,670 --> 01:23:05,430
it any different? That's what dancing is. It's doing different poses in a row to create a dance.

577
01:23:05,430 --> 01:23:13,350
If I were to go like this, that's me doing different poses and animating with keyframes

578
01:23:13,350 --> 01:23:25,189
in between. Anyways, the winner. That's not the right sound. The winner of the 2021 Best

579
01:23:25,189 --> 01:23:38,090
Dancing Award goes to... What do you think? What do you think? Stop playing the fucking Among Us,

580
01:23:38,090 --> 01:23:41,609
I'm the Impostor sound. Fuck out of here. I don't want to hear that ever again.

581
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:50,979
Breakdancing with 27% of the vote. And then in second place with 20% was the goddamn Orangatang,

582
01:23:50,979 --> 01:24:00,810
the TikTok one. And then 12%, no rehearsal, no problem. So breakdancing during the dollhouse was

583
01:24:00,810 --> 01:24:10,949
the winner. At 27% of the vote, a lot. Fair enough. I don't even want to do this one,

584
01:24:10,949 --> 01:24:16,649
but we're going to do it. This is worse, Peter. There are a lot of people here watching and I

585
01:24:16,649 --> 01:24:19,930
need to give context to this because I feel like you'd probably just think I was a fucking psycho

586
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:37,750
if I didn't. So pretty much, we're at the end game now, Peter. Game almost crashed. You have

587
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:42,899
to punish me for doing what I just did and saying what I just said. It's the mustache,

588
01:24:42,899 --> 01:24:48,100
Peter. Peter, it's the mustache. You're probably also probably wondering if worse Peter's on there.

589
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:51,939
Of course it is. I don't think I said it once. I think that's the only time I said it the whole

590
01:24:51,939 --> 01:24:58,939
year. This is on there. It has to be on there. I don't even care. Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

591
01:24:58,939 --> 01:25:02,539
Welcome to episode one of Dremacraft, the series where I play Minecraft.

592
01:25:02,539 --> 01:25:06,939
Peter, this is going to be a single player. Let's play. Oh, it turned into a different animal.

593
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:21,369
Oh, Peter. Keith, Mark, Zane, Evan. How could we have forgotten Peter? Please, to make your

594
01:25:21,369 --> 01:25:28,489
acquaintance. I was a rancher here for years, but I can... Hey, hey, Peter. Sorry. You have

595
01:25:28,489 --> 01:25:34,939
your own empire. Cool. Oh, this is cool. We're in the end game now, Peter. So I mean, this is like,

596
01:25:34,939 --> 01:25:47,319
cool. I swear to fucking God, if I play that sound again, I'm going to freak out.

597
01:25:47,319 --> 01:26:01,180
The award for worst Peter of the year goes to... Why would... Okay, I have a question.

598
01:26:02,380 --> 01:26:11,239
Why was this such a huge percentage? I don't understand. Obama reads Dremacraft, Peter,

599
01:26:11,239 --> 01:26:17,739
with 41% of the vote. They were all the same exact thing. All of them were the same. There was no

600
01:26:17,739 --> 01:26:27,100
difference. Why was that so much higher than all the others? 41%? Did you all collectively

601
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:30,539
get in discord or something and say, oh, hey, by the way, we're all going to vote for the Obama

602
01:26:30,539 --> 01:26:38,329
one? End game, Peter. And then, hey, Peter. Who knows what the fuck that one was? Who cares,

603
01:26:38,329 --> 01:26:51,609
though? Does it matter? I think I just paper cut in my neck. Oh, the price we pay for fucking

604
01:26:51,609 --> 01:27:02,460
showmanship. Coming up next, we have Otto. We have best Otto moment, which is every time that

605
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:08,039
the dog has been... I got a dog, Otto. He's a little wiener dog. I'm fine. Look, there's nothing. It's

606
01:27:08,039 --> 01:27:17,020
fine. I'm fine. This is best Otto moment when my dog was on screen or maybe not. Maybe it's just

607
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:25,699
when Otto was mentioned or Otto was like some type of... It's in spirit, right? Here are the nominees

608
01:27:25,699 --> 01:27:34,119
for best Otto. I can do that better. I can do that better. Here are the nominees for best Otto

609
01:27:34,119 --> 01:28:06,380
moment. Oh, look at it. It's Otto. Let's take it. We'll go to Tokyo. Yeah, I want to do the mango.

610
01:28:07,829 --> 01:28:14,260
Oh, nice, Otto. I want to sneeze. I'm not about to sneeze. I'm going to pet Mr. Otto.

611
01:28:19,319 --> 01:28:26,300
You have a scratchy bum? Do you? Do you? Oh, my goodness. I got to get out of the way. He's

612
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:37,319
doing something cute. Hello, Mr. Toe. Hey, what are you doing over there? What are you doing over

613
01:28:37,319 --> 01:29:01,399
there? What the fuck? Are you dead? Nope. Almost, though. Are you petting him? If you die right now.

614
01:29:01,399 --> 01:29:14,550
I'm going to die. You understand? Bobbleheads? Oh, Otto. I can't believe there's an Otto. Oh,

615
01:29:14,550 --> 01:29:26,890
I missed. Oh, it's a dachshund. Oh, it's Otto. It's little Otto. Where's Otto?

616
01:29:36,010 --> 01:29:47,079
Who's a good boy? Otto. You guys want to see something funny? That bed was like $200.

617
01:29:47,079 --> 01:29:57,159
That bed was like 30. Move out of the way for Otto. It's the same clip, except he's in the $200 bed.

618
01:29:57,720 --> 01:30:06,279
That's my favorite part about that. He was in... Okay, whatever. Ladies and gentlemen, the winner

619
01:30:12,729 --> 01:30:26,470
of Best Otto Moment goes to Orange Blanket Otto with 25% of the vote. Really? Wow. A pet Otto was

620
01:30:26,470 --> 01:30:35,539
15%, which I would assume that would be higher. And then Otto sneezes off camera, 14%. Orange

621
01:30:35,539 --> 01:30:41,770
Blanket with 25% of the vote. By the way, keep in mind, these have been rounded up. So Orange

622
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:51,460
Blanket probably got like 25.9% of the vote. So just for your viewership, you're able to see

623
01:30:51,460 --> 01:30:56,739
and process because I needed to have round numbers. That just tried to kill me. This just

624
01:30:56,739 --> 01:31:04,359
tried to wrap around my neck and kill me. Round numbers are easier for me, so hopefully they're

625
01:31:04,359 --> 01:31:09,239
easier for you. All right, we'll do one more. We're going to get through this one right now.

626
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:15,479
This is the last, I think, of the shit categories. I think this is the last of the dumb shitty

627
01:31:15,479 --> 01:31:22,979
categories. I have to warn some of the new viewers here. I know there's 36,000 fucking people here.

628
01:31:22,979 --> 01:31:28,789
Listen to me. You're probably going to want to leave the stream after this. But stay. I promise

629
01:31:28,789 --> 01:31:32,710
that this community is one of the funnest communities I've ever had the pleasure of being

630
01:31:32,710 --> 01:31:37,350
part of. You're going to probably leave the stream during this because you're probably like,

631
01:31:37,350 --> 01:31:40,789
I hate this sound. I don't like this. This guy sucks. I hate listening to this guy.

632
01:31:40,789 --> 01:31:45,939
Why is he doing this? This is the best Aaron of the year. We just saw Armin play in the rumble.

633
01:31:46,869 --> 01:31:56,199
I'm going to give you what exactly what I mean by this. So best Aaron is, okay, how do I explain

634
01:31:56,199 --> 01:32:04,460
this? So in the Attack on Titan English dub, the actor that does Armin and Mikasa too, if you've

635
01:32:04,460 --> 01:32:11,529
ever seen Attack on Titan, they're always yelling for Aaron. They're always yelling his name and

636
01:32:11,529 --> 01:32:20,140
they're always doing it very loudly and very, you know what? Whatever. You understand. Thanks for

637
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:27,260
watching. TLDR. I just like, I don't know. It's stuck in my brain and I had to say it all the time.

638
01:32:27,260 --> 01:32:43,130
I swear to God, I say this every day. That's a good, you're right. Freeze. Freeze. It's

639
01:32:43,130 --> 01:32:50,899
midnight EST in like three minutes. Freeze. Nobody move. Oh my God. I need the thing.

640
01:32:50,899 --> 01:32:59,029
Was it Lang Syne? Okay, I gotta get ready. I gotta get ready. It's in two minutes.

641
01:33:07,109 --> 01:33:20,060
How? This is like guitar. What's it called? Old Lang Syne? Old Lang Syne? Why are they all this?

642
01:33:20,060 --> 01:33:32,010
It's all this one. Is this a popular one? Two minutes until New Year's on East Coast.

643
01:33:32,010 --> 01:33:45,000
Old Lang Syne. Old Lang Syne. This is like Scottish. I just need old Lang Syne. I just need

644
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:58,920
royalty free with no lyrics. Royalty free, no lyrics. Old Lang Syne. Royalty free. Okay. All

645
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:06,789
right. Okay. Here we go. Welcome to 2021 in two minutes. We have two minutes. It's a Scottish

646
01:34:06,789 --> 01:34:15,220
poem. It is. I don't want to even see that fucking underarm bullshit. We got one minute. I gotta,

647
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:24,279
we gotta count this down. We're almost there. We're getting close. These are like almost done.

648
01:34:24,279 --> 01:34:30,920
Should I take these off? We're probably gonna be able to count down the Pacific one too because

649
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:40,569
there's like lots left for me to do here. 30 seconds till New Year's. I'm in Pacific so it's

650
01:34:40,569 --> 01:34:47,800
not New Year's for me but we'll celebrate East Coast nonetheless. Here we go. The ball's about

651
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:55,510
to drop in New York City. Do it in your Boston accent. All right. Yeah. You want me to do it in

652
01:34:55,510 --> 01:35:01,140
the old Lang Syne in my Boston accent? All right. Let's see if I can get it back. And a five, four,

653
01:35:01,699 --> 01:35:07,380
three, two, one. Happy fucking New Year. And a

654
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:26,329
their old Lang Syne. And all the Red Sox players should fucking get paid more than the Yankees do.

655
01:35:28,659 --> 01:35:38,579
And all the Patriots who cares about Tom Brady. He's a fucking loser. I don't even fucking care.

656
01:35:40,630 --> 01:35:50,069
And all the Revolution was a soccer team and the Bruins. And fuck you for fucking talking shit to

657
01:35:50,069 --> 01:35:57,220
me about my mother behind my back that one time that year and I fucking never forgot. Happy New

658
01:35:57,220 --> 01:36:12,899
Year. Happy New Year all you East Coasters. We'll keep going. Thanks for spending it here with me.

659
01:36:12,899 --> 01:36:32,649
We'll keep moving on. Acquaintance be forgot and all before Lang Syne and all acquaintance be

660
01:36:33,529 --> 01:36:43,770
for God and I lots of time. I don't, nobody knows the lyrics. They all just hum it. Whenever you see

661
01:36:43,770 --> 01:36:48,409
people like shifting back and forth and the big crowds at New Year's, none of them know what the

662
01:36:48,409 --> 01:37:09,449
song is. They're all just going like this. Nobody knows what the fuck the lyrics are to this song.

663
01:37:09,449 --> 01:37:22,069
And let me be the first to ruin your New Year with best Aaron. That's a good, you're right.

664
01:37:22,069 --> 01:37:35,689
I'm just shit my pants when I did that. I actually almost just shit my pants for real.

665
01:37:35,689 --> 01:37:39,689
I'm not kidding. That was actually almost. I almost shit my pants right now on. Thank God it

666
01:37:39,689 --> 01:37:47,770
wasn't on camera. Someone that goes, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron.

667
01:37:47,770 --> 01:37:55,210
I've never done that. I'm back to easy. We, we, that's

668
01:37:58,380 --> 01:38:05,819
Aaron. Um, stop. Stop. It's a test. Aaron. What is that? What's Aaron? What's Aaron?

669
01:38:06,539 --> 01:38:15,140
What is that? What's Aaron? Why are they saying Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron. Oh shit. You're gonna

670
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:18,460
know who I am. No. Oh, what I meant to say was,

671
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:26,359
that's fun. That's not funny. I'm doing an impression of Armin from attack on Titan.

672
01:38:27,079 --> 01:38:31,960
I'm just doing it. I just got, I have to, I'll do it over here. So it's not as loud.

673
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:39,079
I'm sorry. I have, I do have no idea. You know what it's like to fucking live with me.

674
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:52,180
Oh, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, run away, Aaron. Do Hercule. Oh, I can do that. Look,

675
01:38:52,180 --> 01:38:57,779
that's, I love that character in attack on Titan. Oh, right. I love when that character shows up

676
01:38:57,779 --> 01:39:07,859
and says, I am the strongest person on earth. What do you know about that one? Aaron, Aaron, Aaron.

677
01:39:07,859 --> 01:39:14,140
Didn't say it in the funny voice. Aaron. No, that wasn't even the right one. Aaron. There you go.

678
01:39:14,699 --> 01:39:22,329
You get that like once a week. Those whose eyes are clouded are besieged by the ghosts that haunt them.

679
01:39:22,329 --> 01:39:39,859
Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron.

680
01:39:39,859 --> 01:39:46,710
Okay. There you go. So I know you said, shut up. You must be one of the two. You should have voted

681
01:39:46,710 --> 01:40:07,100
no. Why did you want me to do that? 76% of you told me to do that. The winner this year and the

682
01:40:07,100 --> 01:40:21,060
only year for best Aaron is at 17% of the vote. 76% of you voted for this. The last one you just

683
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:31,319
heard. It was bad. I didn't stop. I just kept going. I kept doing it. I didn't pause. Microphone Aaron

684
01:40:31,319 --> 01:40:43,350
was at 13 and Goku Aaron was at 12. All right. We're going to do one more. No, no, we're not.

685
01:40:43,350 --> 01:40:52,539
No, we're not. Oh my God. Yeah, we should. We did two more. All right. Sometimes on this stream,

686
01:40:52,539 --> 01:40:59,939
I like to do impressions. Sometimes on this stream, I like to do impressions. Whether that's Obama,

687
01:40:59,939 --> 01:41:05,640
or whether that's Homer Simpson, or whether that's how much you've lost on a coin toss.

688
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:09,560
I like to do impressions. I like to just kind of say things and do things, right?

689
01:41:10,119 --> 01:41:18,170
Sometimes they're better than others. Sometimes impressions are bad. I'm just giving context to

690
01:41:18,170 --> 01:41:25,449
people. That's not me doing an impression. That was context. Sometimes I do impressions and we're

691
01:41:25,449 --> 01:41:29,350
going to start with the best. So these are the best. No, we're going to start with the worst

692
01:41:29,350 --> 01:41:34,649
because I want people to see how good I am later. These are the worst impressions of the year.

693
01:41:34,649 --> 01:41:47,140
Sometimes they're good. Sometimes they're bad. I can't tell you how to feel either way, but we're

694
01:41:47,140 --> 01:41:56,020
going to start with the worst. No, let's start with the best foot forward. Best foot forward.

695
01:41:56,020 --> 01:42:02,279
These are the nominees for best impression of the year. Here we go. Best impression.

696
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:37,079
Banned me if I'm wrong. I bet you can't do a perfect wolf howl on stream right now.

697
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:44,220
Banned that guy for life. Banned that guy again if he's still here. Banned that guy for life.

698
01:42:44,220 --> 01:42:46,380
Banned him for life. He doesn't get to come back. Banned him if he's here right now. He

699
01:42:46,380 --> 01:42:49,260
does not get to come back. Banned that guy permanently. He does not get to come back.

700
01:43:07,079 --> 01:43:13,479
You go play the sounds that I just made. The ones I just made.

701
01:43:14,899 --> 01:43:19,220
Play it. I want to hear it. Clip it. I want to hear it. I never yelled. It was like...

702
01:43:20,020 --> 01:43:28,859
I'd just be sitting there going like...

703
01:43:38,300 --> 01:43:41,180
Vodwatcher right now was able to go like this.

704
01:43:46,069 --> 01:43:48,630
Okay, so we're going to play Deltarune now. We're going to start the game now.

705
01:43:59,399 --> 01:44:04,920
My territory. And I will let you leave.

706
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:08,840
You imitate the sounds of shoes squeaking on a basketball court. Yeah.

707
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:28,739
Oh, hey, guys. Hey, you ever pick up the phone and somebody... It's a wrong number.

708
01:44:28,739 --> 01:44:34,579
And you say, oh, hey, wrong number. Hey, screw you, buddy. You know what I mean? That's plus two.

709
01:44:34,579 --> 01:44:38,899
No, no, no, no, no. Get the fuck out of here.

710
01:44:46,970 --> 01:44:53,500
Car noise. It's like...

711
01:44:57,500 --> 01:45:24,380
This one's not going to be close. The winner for best impression of the year

712
01:45:25,340 --> 01:45:38,920
goes to... You probably could guess it. It was Spampton. At 31% of the vote, Spampton, which

713
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:46,729
I've seen a lot of people say they liked the Spampton voice. I was just kind of fucking around.

714
01:45:46,729 --> 01:45:53,529
If you liked it, I'm glad you did. I was just having fun. Chat chimps at 12% and then skipping

715
01:45:53,529 --> 01:46:04,439
through the VOD at 15%. Here are your best impressions of the year, apparently. It was

716
01:46:04,439 --> 01:46:10,970
an interpretation. Yeah, yeah, exactly. That's what I said. Chimps got robbed. Well, you just

717
01:46:10,970 --> 01:46:18,550
want chimps to win because you are a chat chimp. You got bias. So with the best comes the worst.

718
01:46:18,550 --> 01:46:22,699
And these are the ones... It's funny because people are probably watching right now going,

719
01:46:24,069 --> 01:46:30,539
oh, dude, half of those were dog shit. Well, just wait till you hear the ones that weren't

720
01:46:30,539 --> 01:46:34,380
nominated for best of the year. Wait till you see the ones that were nominated for the worst

721
01:46:34,380 --> 01:46:44,760
of the year. And I gotta... Okay, I have to defend myself right now. I don't... Sometimes I just sit

722
01:46:44,760 --> 01:46:50,680
here and I just talk and I just like do somebody else's voice or something. And I'm not even trying

723
01:46:50,680 --> 01:46:55,000
to do it. I'm not trying to do an impression. I just do Donald Duck. I'm just like, all right,

724
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:58,359
I'm going to do... I'll do Donald Duck right now. That sounds like kind of a fun time.

725
01:46:58,359 --> 01:47:02,819
And then people go, oh, hey, that sucked. And I go, all right, well then fucking nominate it already.

726
01:47:02,819 --> 01:47:07,699
Here are your nominees for worst impression of the year. And you all know who won. So who cares?

727
01:47:07,699 --> 01:47:18,420
Let's go. Worst impression of the year. Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to episode

728
01:47:18,420 --> 01:47:23,859
one of JermaCraft, the series where I play Minecraft. This is going to be a single player

729
01:47:23,859 --> 01:47:30,020
let's play. And when I say let's play, I use that term pretty loosely because I'm an idiot in this

730
01:47:30,020 --> 01:47:38,649
game. What are you talking about? Are you sure we don't have to go fix the grandma's recipe?

731
01:47:39,609 --> 01:47:42,890
No, Chippendale. You've got to go to a foreign fucking land and you've got to start

732
01:47:42,890 --> 01:47:49,050
shooting at stuff. What are you talking about? That's how you treat it.

733
01:47:49,050 --> 01:48:01,050
You want to impression Bowser? Okay. Peter Dactyl. I've turned into a pterodactyl. I am now

734
01:48:01,050 --> 01:48:08,899
Peter Dactyl. He flies and smashes right into the side of like Cleveland's house.

735
01:48:08,899 --> 01:48:12,180
Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to episode one of JermaCraft,

736
01:48:12,180 --> 01:48:16,979
the series where I play Minecraft. This is going to be a single player let's play. And I say,

737
01:48:16,979 --> 01:48:21,939
when I say let's play, I use that term pretty loosely because I am a stupid idiot dumb ass

738
01:48:21,939 --> 01:48:26,979
in this game. You're going to see lots of you. That's a fake one. Audition for Waluigi right

739
01:48:26,979 --> 01:48:41,619
now. All right. Everybody cheated, but me. Jesus Christ. This should have won. That should have won.

740
01:48:41,619 --> 01:48:47,220
Did I get the part? You sound like Homer Simpson today. Well, thanks. I appreciate that.

741
01:48:47,939 --> 01:49:02,250
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. There it is. Fuck off. I got it. Oh, Joe, Joe, the Bionicles.

742
01:49:02,250 --> 01:49:04,970
They're never going to make it. I don't think they're going to make it, Joe.

743
01:49:05,850 --> 01:49:08,569
Chad, what do you guys think? Will you just shut up, man?

744
01:49:10,819 --> 01:49:22,569
What? Trying to watch the movie here. Ah, of course they're going to make it.

745
01:49:23,779 --> 01:49:31,140
They're the damn Bionicles. Now hear me. Morning. How are you? It should be pleased you to know that

746
01:49:31,140 --> 01:49:37,029
the purple Pikmin are lodged safely in my home. That wasn't Bernie. That was supposed to be

747
01:49:37,029 --> 01:49:46,710
Arnold Schwarzenegger. Good morning. How are you? Fuck. That is Bernie. Good morning. How are you?

748
01:49:46,710 --> 01:49:52,550
How are you? How are you? Good morning. Good morning. Fuck. Did you do Tommy Lee Jones?

749
01:49:52,710 --> 01:50:01,579
I'll try. You do an impression of Daniel Day-Lewis in Where There Will Be Blood. Sure.

750
01:50:10,619 --> 01:50:28,819
All right. I don't think the Daniel Day-Lewis one was that bad. Can I be honest? The Daniel

751
01:50:28,819 --> 01:50:35,350
Day-Lewis one was more like feeling and like mannerism. It was more like an emotion.

752
01:50:36,170 --> 01:50:45,270
It was. I wasn't. You know what I mean? Whatever. By the way, anybody that does an Arnold Schwarzenegger

753
01:50:45,270 --> 01:50:53,189
impression, they're just going to do Bernie Sanders. Listen for it. If you can differentiate

754
01:50:53,189 --> 01:51:10,949
yourself from Arnold to Bernie, you got a great fucking Arnold impression. Lois won with 21% of

755
01:51:10,949 --> 01:51:16,329
the vote. And then Homer Simpson with 13. And then Chip and Dale. Chip and Dale. I think Chip

756
01:51:16,329 --> 01:51:25,399
and Dale was the worst. That's cope. Yeah, that's fine. There it is. Lois is your winner with 21%.

757
01:51:25,399 --> 01:51:31,880
Homer Simpson 13. Chip and Dale with 11. I think Chip and Dale was the worst by far. Chip and Dale

758
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:42,810
was so bad it hurt my ears listening back when I got the video to compile into OBS. It was awful.

759
01:51:42,810 --> 01:51:50,260
And with that, we're going to move back to Germanium. We're going to go back to the German

760
01:51:50,260 --> 01:51:54,739
Rumble. We still have about five or six matches to do before the Rumble. So we're going to move

761
01:51:54,739 --> 01:52:01,979
this over here. Let's keep this going here. I hope you can't see it. All right. I think we're good.

762
01:52:03,909 --> 01:52:15,159
On to the next match. This one's going to be interesting. Mitch McConnell should have been

763
01:52:15,159 --> 01:52:23,689
on there. I think that was last year. I think it was. I think it was on last year. I just burped

764
01:52:23,689 --> 01:52:32,260
and I'm so glad I fucking got rid of it. I'm going to need a refill soon here. We are definitely

765
01:52:32,260 --> 01:52:36,180
going to count down the Pacific New Year's, by the way. There's no way we don't miss it.

766
01:52:36,899 --> 01:52:51,560
There's so much more to do. You didn't see shit. I drink five times a year. Will you let me have

767
01:52:51,560 --> 01:53:02,069
this? I drink five times a year. All right. The next is going to be a one on three tag match,

768
01:53:02,069 --> 01:53:14,060
which could be very interesting. Here we go. Our next match is a one on three tag match,

769
01:53:14,060 --> 01:53:25,100
handicap match. For those in the audience that were Dollhouse fans, this is a Dollhouse themed

770
01:53:25,100 --> 01:53:32,920
matchup. Our first contestant is going to be Jerma from the Dollhouse, specifically wearing the

771
01:53:34,779 --> 01:53:51,380
Cherubianship belt. That is Dollhouse Jerma. That's true. That's not true. One half of the

772
01:53:51,380 --> 01:54:10,300
Jeremy? Is there another half? Yeah, that's me in the day one Dollhouse outfit and I am facing three

773
01:54:10,300 --> 01:54:21,100
people at the same time. Well, it's a tag match. Trying to think of who I would really be kind of

774
01:54:21,100 --> 01:54:26,500
annoyed with. Three people in particular that I just, God, they got on my nerves. They were

775
01:54:26,500 --> 01:54:38,260
always around me. They were always causing problems. I could sense them. I heard them.

776
01:54:38,260 --> 01:54:46,979
I could feel them in the room with me. And even still, when I go back and watch footage,

777
01:54:46,979 --> 01:54:59,689
I'm still surprised of their existence. And I don't believe it a lot of the time. People tell me,

778
01:54:59,689 --> 01:55:07,539
oh, no, this happened. This happened. I'm like, no, it didn't. That's so weird. And I got the belt

779
01:55:07,539 --> 01:55:20,489
too. Some of you are guessing what it is and some of you got it right. Bald is beautiful. I'm not

780
01:55:20,489 --> 01:55:29,739
bald and I'm 36. Do you understand how awesome that is? I am not bald and I'm 36. Holy smokes.

781
01:55:29,739 --> 01:55:37,289
I can say that. That's awesome. I probably won't make it to 40, but who knows? We'll find out.

782
01:55:37,850 --> 01:55:43,510
Thank you for joining me on this New Year's, by the way. And I'm doing my tuber voice because

783
01:55:43,510 --> 01:55:53,979
we're doing commentary on the wrestling, of course. And who I am facing is the dastardly,

784
01:55:53,979 --> 01:56:05,619
the sneaky, the strange, the out of the ordinary, the paralysis demon-like shadow moving people.

785
01:56:06,260 --> 01:56:18,489
Three of the shadow movers in a furniture matchup. I believe this is a tables,

786
01:56:18,489 --> 01:56:27,220
ladders, and chairs match. This is shadow mover one. And I think they have the same entrance,

787
01:56:27,220 --> 01:56:31,140
so I don't know if we need to do shadow mover two and threes entrance, but they are terrifying.

788
01:56:35,340 --> 01:56:47,029
Get them. I will skip this because it's two more of the same intro, but we'll wait for the

789
01:56:47,029 --> 01:56:51,590
prediction to be over because I don't want to start the match yet. I don't know if I would

790
01:56:51,590 --> 01:57:05,300
vote for me. It's one V three. Although you might make money if I win. That'd be great.

791
01:57:06,020 --> 01:57:23,020
How much pyrotechnics? Oh my God. Relax. He's using a lot of gas. Jesus. Yeah, it's three.

792
01:57:23,020 --> 01:57:39,510
There are three shadow movers versus me. Let's go. Let's go. Just to prove it, it's three

793
01:57:39,510 --> 01:57:44,949
shadow movers. Yeah. We're not going to do this three times. I'm not doing that three times.

794
01:57:46,680 --> 01:57:50,600
Tables, ladders, and chairs match one V three handicap tag. Here we go.

795
01:57:51,699 --> 01:58:01,859
All house, Jerma versus three shadow movers. Begin. Tag rules apply right off the bat.

796
01:58:03,750 --> 01:58:14,090
Immediate pin. So I have to be careful here because I have to slow down.

797
01:58:14,890 --> 01:58:19,319
Don't use all my strength. Don't miss kicks to the ground for no reason.

798
01:58:22,300 --> 01:58:26,779
These are the guys that I heard about that were walking around during the dollhouse and moving

799
01:58:26,779 --> 01:58:33,960
furniture. That's what I was told. What a weird experience that was. It's my revenge time.

800
01:58:33,960 --> 01:58:53,210
Don't just stand there. What are you stupid? I got to go through three of them and I got good

801
01:58:53,210 --> 01:59:04,409
stats. Let me tell you. Choking Jerma, dollhouse Jerma on the ropes while one of the three big

802
01:59:04,409 --> 01:59:09,670
right hand onto Jerma nine eight five dollhouse Jerma nine eight five eight one. Tagging in one

803
01:59:09,670 --> 01:59:16,260
of the other movers, which I believe they move in unison. I don't know if they're a single unit,

804
01:59:16,260 --> 01:59:23,430
if they're a collective unit. They could be a hive mind. I don't know. This is sad.

805
01:59:24,949 --> 01:59:31,130
Why is it sad? I didn't lose yet. Don't say that. I've only got a ladder in the goddamn ring.

806
01:59:35,750 --> 01:59:43,399
Don't count me out just yet. Come on. Look at me. I'm getting really excited.

807
01:59:48,619 --> 01:59:55,180
Oh, I just choked his neck. Okay. The ducky shirt is perfect. It really is.

808
02:00:00,520 --> 02:00:06,710
Don't get stuck on the ropes and crash the damn game. Where else do you choke people?

809
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:15,340
Um, I don't know. You can choke them in the water. Don't win. Dude, you must have huge

810
02:00:15,340 --> 02:00:19,100
sweat marks right now. I do. And you should have seen the sweat mark of the dollhouse.

811
02:00:19,659 --> 02:00:24,470
I'm glad I get to change clothes. Now dollhouse Jerma going into the corner.

812
02:00:25,270 --> 02:00:40,760
Does the gentle drop that you hear? I'm talking into my wine glass right now. Try deodorant.

813
02:00:43,829 --> 02:00:48,789
Look, there's a huge difference between sitting around with a blaring ring light

814
02:00:48,789 --> 02:00:55,909
and a hot ass room. And you're wicked excited for the rumble and the look at me, by the way.

815
02:00:55,909 --> 02:01:09,430
Look at me taking fucking names here. I am taking names here. Or at least I was until you said

816
02:01:09,430 --> 02:01:18,979
something. You probably have high blood sugar. No. All right. I don't need any medical Andes

817
02:01:18,979 --> 02:01:33,159
to tell me what's wrong with me. I'm fine. Yeah. Let me go get a blood glue close monitor and

818
02:01:33,159 --> 02:01:58,420
prick my finger. False count anywhere. I almost just won. What? My glue close my glue. Whatever.

819
02:01:58,420 --> 02:02:16,119
Glenn close. What am I saying? You know what I'm saying. Big DDT on dollhouse Jerma. If I get pinned

820
02:02:16,119 --> 02:02:21,720
I'm gonna be pissed. Don't lose right now. Are you fucking kidding me? What a shitty match.

821
02:02:22,520 --> 02:02:43,300
That was awful. That was terrible. What was this move supposed to be?

822
02:02:44,810 --> 02:02:53,579
What? Maybe if I grab him by his waist and hold him down on top of me, how am I not being pinned?

823
02:02:54,869 --> 02:03:04,619
Was he pinning me? That was so stupid. What a terrible move. It was awful. The shadow movers

824
02:03:04,619 --> 02:03:10,300
are your winner. We're not doing a rematch because that match was terrible. They didn't even get any

825
02:03:10,300 --> 02:03:14,140
ladders, any chairs, or any tables. It was supposed to be a furniture match.

826
02:03:15,180 --> 02:03:20,619
They did not care to take any of the furniture from under the ring. I just lost in five minutes.

827
02:03:21,180 --> 02:03:41,430
Okay. On to the next one. Oh, this is gonna be good. This one's gonna be good. You got bodied.

828
02:03:41,430 --> 02:03:46,380
It's a 3v1, man. I was gonna get my ass kicked no matter what. Unless I could get a table or

829
02:03:46,380 --> 02:04:08,819
something. Let's go. Willem Dafoe. I almost spelt that all over me. All right. The next one coming

830
02:04:08,819 --> 02:04:16,250
up is a false count anywhere for fatal four way. L ratio. Give me your keys. I'm not going. What

831
02:04:16,250 --> 02:04:21,560
are you talking about? I'm gonna, my ass is going to be planted in this seat for the next like three

832
02:04:21,560 --> 02:04:37,350
hours. I ain't going anywhere. All right. Here we go. The next match is a fatal four way.

833
02:04:38,069 --> 02:04:43,529
And I would call this one the gamer match because I mean, here comes Pac-Man 99.

834
02:04:48,920 --> 02:05:05,369
Pac-Man 99 from the fifth dimension. He what? P-A-C, man.

835
02:05:06,810 --> 02:05:20,619
Pac-Man 99 is your first contestant. This is the gamer battle, like I told you. Fatal,

836
02:05:20,619 --> 02:05:42,939
fatal four way. Let me copyright. Oh, please. Copyright. Our second contestant in this is,

837
02:05:42,939 --> 02:05:47,909
of course, who could forget Cosmic Calamity from Monster Rancher 2.

838
02:05:52,789 --> 02:06:00,180
I don't know how well this is going to play out because block wrestlers can crash the game

839
02:06:00,180 --> 02:06:04,180
and they can fuck up the whole game. So if the game crashes, that's a huge problem.

840
02:06:07,239 --> 02:06:13,659
That is Jerma's, why am I speaking in third person? It's mine. That is my Monster Rancher 2

841
02:06:13,659 --> 02:06:20,520
character. Third person? What the fuck was that? Oh, that's Jerma's, the idea of mind?

842
02:06:21,239 --> 02:06:32,649
That is Cosmic Calamity. Don't, stop chanting crash. I don't want the game to crash. Don't say

843
02:06:32,649 --> 02:06:50,979
that. Captain Olimar from the Wii. I don't know what he's holding. What is that? Are they Pikmin

844
02:06:50,979 --> 02:07:03,590
in that sack? What's in the sack? That's kind of fucked up. It's a great Olimar, by the way.

845
02:07:12,840 --> 02:07:22,359
It's the Pikmin. Don't swing it around. What are you doing? If you missed my Pikmin playthrough,

846
02:07:22,359 --> 02:07:28,949
I thought the Wii sucks and I thought the game sucks. I hate the Wii and I hate Pikmin.

847
02:07:28,949 --> 02:07:54,100
Our next contestant is Anubis from Smite. My favorite Smite character, Anoa Bass?

848
02:07:57,930 --> 02:08:09,800
Okay, I didn't know that. I didn't know that it was Anoa Bass. So we have Anubis,

849
02:08:09,800 --> 02:08:20,100
Pacman99, Olimar, and Cosmic Calamity in a four-way. All right. I think it's Extreme

850
02:08:20,100 --> 02:08:28,180
Rules 2. We'll find out in a second. I got my money on Cosmic Calamity or Anubis because I love

851
02:08:28,180 --> 02:08:33,829
Smite. Everybody else hates it. It was nominated for worst stream of the year, by the way.

852
02:08:35,819 --> 02:08:45,659
Four-way. Don't pin immediately. I actually kind of hope it happens. So Anubis and Cosmic

853
02:08:45,659 --> 02:08:53,829
Calamity now in the corner. Already some drama. Prediction. I don't think we can do prediction.

854
02:08:55,430 --> 02:09:01,449
Crash. Don't stop. I don't want the game to crash. Stop saying that. The Rumble is... Okay,

855
02:09:01,449 --> 02:09:06,569
let me tell you something about the Rumble. The Rumble this year is like 22 characters that you

856
02:09:06,569 --> 02:09:11,880
are not going to see. None of these fucking idiots are in the Rumble. Let me make that really clear.

857
02:09:12,890 --> 02:09:17,770
None of these dickheads are in the Rumble. There were just so many characters this year.

858
02:09:22,180 --> 02:09:38,329
All falls count anywhere. Who just hit their head? Please, I don't want the game to crash. God,

859
02:09:39,050 --> 02:09:56,279
what you idiots. And Cosmic... I can't. Somebody said, where's the Among Us match?

860
02:09:59,619 --> 02:10:07,779
You'll never see one on this channel. Never. So in the corner, Cosmic Calamity in Olimar.

861
02:10:09,260 --> 02:10:14,329
Let's just throw somebody into the stairs 10 times in a row. That's great. Yeah, go ahead.

862
02:10:14,970 --> 02:10:20,949
Hey, throw into the stairs again. Does anybody else want to throw somebody into the stairs?

863
02:10:20,949 --> 02:10:31,460
Throw them into the stairs again. Will they do anything else? Do something besides throw into

864
02:10:31,460 --> 02:10:49,430
stairs. Oh my God. I got an idea. I'll throw them into the stairs and then I'll try to pin them.

865
02:10:49,430 --> 02:10:56,020
That'll work. Hey, you guys want them over there? I'll throw them over there. There's no stairs

866
02:10:56,020 --> 02:10:58,979
over there, but I'll throw them that way. And then I'll do a fucking Fortnite dance.

867
02:11:01,189 --> 02:11:16,409
Hi, dear. Leave me alone. I got an idea. Hey, I got an idea. How about Olimar grasping by the neck

868
02:11:16,409 --> 02:11:27,020
and fucking twisting? All right, back in the ring. Olimar now throwing Calamity. No, reversal on the

869
02:11:27,020 --> 02:11:33,699
ropes. Interesting. Put them into the turlet. I have no idea who... I think there's extreme rules

870
02:11:33,699 --> 02:11:45,609
on this too. Big DDT by Cosmic Calamity while Lanubis and Pac-Man 99 are in the corner pushing

871
02:11:45,609 --> 02:11:54,970
his foot into his neck or whatever that is. I don't know if he has a face. How come Cosmic's

872
02:11:54,970 --> 02:12:04,279
not one-shotting everybody? Well, Cosmic Calamity has, I believe, like a hundred strength and zero

873
02:12:04,279 --> 02:12:24,579
everything else, I think. So it's there. Going for the pin already. Threatening. Anubis Smite,

874
02:12:24,579 --> 02:12:30,149
by the way, voted for one of the worst streams of the year. It is nominated for one of the worst

875
02:12:30,149 --> 02:12:36,970
streams of the whole year. We'll find out what that is later on tonight. Big pin covering by

876
02:12:36,970 --> 02:12:44,489
Anubis. No, huge suplex off the top turnbuckle by Olimar to Cosmic Calamity. How are we going

877
02:12:44,489 --> 02:12:54,170
to see a victory already? No way. Anubis breaks that up. We've not seen a weapon. We've not seen

878
02:12:54,170 --> 02:13:03,479
any attacks, chairs, sludge hammers. He just repeated himself three times. He's drunk.

879
02:13:03,479 --> 02:13:15,029
That was a tombstone, but I'm going to start saying differently. I think Anubis just won.

880
02:13:20,409 --> 02:13:30,470
I think Anubis almost just won right there. Anubis, you guys are fucking with me. Okay,

881
02:13:30,470 --> 02:13:59,539
I got to relax. You're being too funny. All right, everybody relax. What is happening?

882
02:13:59,539 --> 02:14:13,989
Big splash. No, only a two count. I'm not high. Just give me a second so I can reconvene my

883
02:14:13,989 --> 02:14:35,590
brain. What did he do that for? Why did he do that? A big right hand by Anubis into a leg drop here.

884
02:14:36,149 --> 02:14:47,319
Now, remember, false count anywhere. You guys are making me laugh. I got to fucking,

885
02:14:47,880 --> 02:15:00,069
I got to hit the brakes. I just got it. What did I miss? A lot of categories, a lot of fun stuff.

886
02:15:02,819 --> 02:15:10,409
Why did the referee is down? Watch the referee. Don't be an idiot. Don't hit the referee. He's

887
02:15:10,409 --> 02:15:19,319
stupid. All right, somebody go through that table. I want someone to go through that table. Look at

888
02:15:19,319 --> 02:15:23,319
how nice they look. They got the German 95 branded logo. Get them through the table for God's sakes.

889
02:15:29,539 --> 02:15:40,619
Anubis with Cosmic Calamity into the stairs again. What else is new? The referee is like,

890
02:15:40,619 --> 02:15:46,920
I should have to work. Your stream is lagging. I don't know why that shouldn't be happening.

891
02:15:48,970 --> 02:15:54,810
All right, get back in the ring. Let's go back to zero. I'm fine. I'm having a great fucking time.

892
02:15:54,810 --> 02:16:02,060
This is so much fun. Hope you're having a good time too. Anubis outside with Cosmic Calamity.

893
02:16:02,060 --> 02:16:06,060
That's not even the right person. Oh my God, Jeremy. Fucking give me a break.

894
02:16:07,159 --> 02:16:13,560
Olimar and Cosmic Calamity in the front of the ring, inside the middle as Calamity gets caught.

895
02:16:14,840 --> 02:16:26,060
I'm not muted. Shut up. Olimar is waiting for it. Oh, that's a stunner. He got him with a stunner.

896
02:16:26,060 --> 02:16:31,479
That's a stunner. Hackman99 is completely clueless, but finally got over there.

897
02:16:33,159 --> 02:16:39,000
That was a stunner. That's his finishing move. Game's not muted. Leave me alone.

898
02:16:42,069 --> 02:17:00,250
Big spin. You're doing your best. I'm surprised. Why has nobody been pinned?

899
02:17:03,190 --> 02:17:07,030
I did not think this was going to go this long as Anubis and Cosmic Calamity.

900
02:17:10,659 --> 02:17:15,610
All right, get him on the top rope. Suplex on the top rope. Let's see it, Anubis.

901
02:17:15,610 --> 02:17:21,780
Oh, I'm not stupid. I can see the OBS meters going up. I'm not dumb.

902
02:17:23,530 --> 02:17:28,649
Big hurricane run of reverse. No, back. Belly to back suplex off the top rope. Anubis to Cosmic

903
02:17:28,649 --> 02:17:37,510
Calamity. That's huge. He may as well just use his ult. Anubis just ulted Cosmic Calamity. Can he?

904
02:17:37,510 --> 02:17:45,420
Why? Don't. Just keep him on the ground, you idiot. What a fucking idiot. What a dumb ass.

905
02:17:50,659 --> 02:17:55,909
Why would you not pin him? I'm not muted. Stop minus twoing. What's wrong with you guys?

906
02:17:55,909 --> 02:18:03,100
Leave me alone. Who is being pinned? You can't even see that from here.

907
02:18:07,780 --> 02:18:21,129
That referee could not even see the pin he was counting. What's happening? He can't even

908
02:18:21,129 --> 02:18:32,569
see. As Olimar grabs Pac-Man 99 going up onto the top here under his shoulders.

909
02:18:34,420 --> 02:18:39,690
That's huge. Olimar could take it away right now. Olimar, take it away right now.

910
02:18:41,139 --> 02:18:50,280
Go for a pin. End it. Stop throwing people into... Oh my god. Pin. Somebody pin.

911
02:18:54,180 --> 02:19:01,579
Big suplex. No. What was that? That's it. But who wins? I don't know. What?

912
02:19:01,579 --> 02:19:19,610
What? He's been pinning for way longer. It was over. Olimar wins. Olimar wins. What the

913
02:19:19,610 --> 02:19:30,709
fuck was that? He started counting for the guys on the left and didn't do Olimar's pin. What?

914
02:19:32,299 --> 02:19:37,350
The ref is drunk too? All right. Hide the champagne bottles from the rest of them. All of us.

915
02:19:42,299 --> 02:19:55,030
I can't believe Olimar didn't win. The ref is shit faced. Another stunner. All right.

916
02:19:55,030 --> 02:20:05,030
Olimar win the game right now. Oh my god. Everybody's shit faced. They were taking

917
02:20:05,030 --> 02:20:11,059
shots of fireball backstage and that's always a bad idea. Don't ever let anyone convince you

918
02:20:11,059 --> 02:20:20,040
that's a good idea. Hey man, you want to take shots of fireball? No is always the answer.

919
02:20:21,139 --> 02:20:41,059
No is always the answer. Always. There's a two count. That's it. Cosmic calamity. I don't

920
02:20:41,059 --> 02:20:47,239
know why they didn't count the Olimar outside. That was horseshit. Cosmic calamity is your

921
02:20:47,239 --> 02:20:53,110
winner of the four person gamer battle. That was rigged. I'll be honest. That was fucked up.

922
02:20:54,739 --> 02:21:03,959
There is no reason why Olimar should not have won. I agree with you. It's really messed up. Not

923
02:21:03,959 --> 02:21:12,329
cool. I mean, I love Cosmic Calamity. They're a great character, but I don't think they should

924
02:21:12,329 --> 02:21:23,100
have won. Not a chance. You did not have to be in the ring. You just had to pin somebody somewhere.

925
02:21:23,579 --> 02:21:35,129
And that is that one. We only have a few more matches left till the rumble. We have a lot of

926
02:21:35,129 --> 02:21:51,579
categories to get through. So we'll go back to the categories. I didn't rig it. I swear to god.

927
02:21:51,579 --> 02:22:01,459
Okay. P break. All right. We'll take one P break here. Go pee. Go put some water on your face.

928
02:22:01,459 --> 02:22:26,620
You know, go take a second. We'll be right back. He's plastered. I'm really not though. I'm just

929
02:22:26,620 --> 02:22:32,760
having a good time. It's been a fucking blast. I'm happy to share it with all of you. I'll be right

930
02:22:32,760 --> 02:27:36,260
back. I'm all right. I'm all right. Don't worry about me. I'll be right back. Okay. Hello. How

931
02:27:36,260 --> 02:27:44,870
are you? Welcome back. We have more categories to go through. Quite a few more. So let's get them

932
02:27:44,870 --> 02:28:05,190
done. Let me make sure this is in the right spot. It is. Okay. Cool. Looks good. Okay. Not much

933
02:28:05,190 --> 02:28:09,670
longer till we have to get rid of the Christmas BRB screen. How was my poop? It was awesome.

934
02:28:09,750 --> 02:28:23,319
Now we're good. Okay. Hi. How are you? Coming up next. This is the meaty categories. No. Oh yeah.

935
02:28:23,319 --> 02:28:34,340
These are meaty. We're going to start with the best joke. Taking more than five minutes to set up.

936
02:28:34,340 --> 02:28:42,680
Seven minutes. Seven minutes for what? Oh shit. Yeah, you're right. Central time. That's right.

937
02:28:42,680 --> 02:28:48,360
All right. So every year there's a lot of jokes that I do. A lot of things that I think are funny

938
02:28:48,360 --> 02:28:54,040
that I hope are funny. But sometimes they're good. Sometimes they're bad. So this is what

939
02:28:54,040 --> 02:29:00,889
people have nominated for the best jokes of the year. Best jokes of the year. So we're getting

940
02:29:00,889 --> 02:29:08,729
into a big category here. This is a huge category. So here are your nominees for best joke of the

941
02:29:08,729 --> 02:29:35,209
year. Taking more than five minutes to set up. Was it blood in my stool? Griffin family. Stewie,

942
02:29:35,209 --> 02:29:40,569
it's time for school. I should not have to go to school. We got this new friend,

943
02:29:40,569 --> 02:29:48,620
German985. He's here hanging out with us. I will make my secret hot tuck it Pete beer cheese

944
02:29:48,620 --> 02:30:01,610
pretzels. Give me that. Come on. 71 million sprints. And that's a coin.

945
02:30:02,569 --> 02:30:21,610
That's 3.1 million limes. Hey, get yourself some nice. This is why he's green.

946
02:30:23,799 --> 02:30:33,219
Only funny voices. Wait, only funny voices for 20 straight minutes. I don't know if I can do that.

947
02:30:33,219 --> 02:30:39,139
It's very difficult to do this and still play the video game at the same time. I'll tell you it's

948
02:30:39,139 --> 02:30:46,180
not easy. This is Bernie. This is Bernie. If Bernie is morphing into a bunch of things,

949
02:30:46,819 --> 02:30:52,899
Bernie is morphing into German guy again. Not a slip. This is non-slip. This is

950
02:30:53,700 --> 02:31:01,559
rockabob. That's not a slip. That sounds sort of like the way that I kind of talk a little.

951
02:31:01,639 --> 02:31:11,129
But now you make me go. Here we go. You grab her. Please eat her. Eat her, please.

952
02:31:12,489 --> 02:31:23,340
Wait, he's still in the cut scene. He's still in the cut scene. Wait, he's blocking.

953
02:31:45,850 --> 02:32:01,110
Okay. I'm going to go for a bite. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.

954
02:32:01,909 --> 02:32:10,649
Oh my God. It's so good.

955
02:32:17,159 --> 02:32:22,280
Okay. So I was at the store yesterday and I got a Dunkin Donuts large iced coffee.

956
02:32:23,719 --> 02:32:28,200
And dude, I'm telling you, it was fucking gross. It was the grossest coffee I've ever had in my life.

957
02:32:28,200 --> 02:32:37,959
It was disgusting. Oh, hey guys. Hey, you ever pick up the phone and somebody, it's a wrong number

958
02:32:37,959 --> 02:32:43,559
and you say, oh, hey, wrong number. Hey, I screw you buddy. You know what I mean? Like that's plus

959
02:32:43,559 --> 02:33:05,020

960
02:33:05,020 --> 02:33:12,489
follow button if you could. Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron. Oh shit. You're going to know who I am.

961
02:33:13,540 --> 02:33:23,030
No. Oh, what I meant to say was, oh, no, I just, you don't know who I am. I'm the secret streamer.

962
02:33:23,030 --> 02:33:28,790
I figured you out. I'm contacting the thieves. Oh yeah. Look at you. Look at me. Look at you.

963
02:33:28,790 --> 02:33:34,309
You think you know who this is? What an idiot. What an idiot. You guys want to fuck with new

964
02:33:34,309 --> 02:33:39,350
viewers? Okay. So I'm going to get a royalty free song. That's like with a bit, like a lot of drums.

02:33:44,870 --> 02:33:56,409

967
02:34:08,069 --> 02:34:11,989
Yo, German on a five here. Just want to say, Oh, I did. I said, excuse me. Is it somebody's birthday

976
02:35:13,379 --> 02:35:21,260
my face. A foil Razzle Puss. You found the company. How much is it worth? Like $350,000.

977
02:35:21,420 --> 02:35:29,180
$350,000. It's $350,000 for the GrottoBeasts.com is what we found. Yeah, buy it. Buy it. Buy it right

978
02:35:29,180 --> 02:35:36,040
now. You got, you got access to my checking account. Get it. Come on up here. Come on.

979
02:35:39,659 --> 02:35:47,020
Happy new year. You'll get up here eventually. I know you will. He's picking the tables up.

980
02:35:47,579 --> 02:36:06,870
Come on up here. This is it. It's in this area here. I'm gonna find that goddamn treasure and

981
02:36:06,950 --> 02:36:13,030
I'll be the first one to close that out. I don't want to go backwards. Oh, I can't believe.

982
02:36:13,030 --> 02:36:15,829
Jerma, how do you know how to use that? But you don't think I fucking know everything?

983
02:36:16,549 --> 02:36:20,549
You don't think I know how to use one of these? I worked for 10 years in the industry.

984
02:36:20,549 --> 02:36:37,780
Give me a break. Okay, so this one is pretty interesting because, uh, happy new year.

985
02:36:37,860 --> 02:36:38,899
Central. Oh, hold on.

986
02:36:54,149 --> 02:37:00,889
Happy new year, Central. The best joke taking more than five minutes to set up.

987
02:37:00,889 --> 02:37:11,559
Which is, this is actually really surprising. I am shocked by this one. The winner of the best joke

988
02:37:11,559 --> 02:37:15,579
taking more than five minutes. This is a shocker. I think a lot of people get this an upset.

989
02:37:18,340 --> 02:37:29,860
It's an upset. What? Leave me alone. Bought a Whopper and ate it on stream with 19% of the vote.

990
02:37:29,860 --> 02:37:38,420
That's the winner. Drumming, rock out break and grotto beasts were pretty much tied. Buying a

991
02:37:38,420 --> 02:37:46,260
Whopper and eating it on stream, you guys thought was better than anything else of the whole year.

992
02:37:46,260 --> 02:37:55,020
I just ate a Whopper on camera. I ate Burger King on camera. I ate Burger King on camera.

993
02:37:56,950 --> 02:38:02,219
Uh, drumming was 12% in second place. That was a pretty good one. I thought that wasn't fun.

994
02:38:03,020 --> 02:38:11,750
That one was very fun. It was rigged. It was not rigged. So just like the best,

995
02:38:11,750 --> 02:38:17,479
let's go ahead and do the worst. These are the worst things I did the whole year.

996
02:38:17,479 --> 02:38:26,360
These are the worst jokes I've ever made in all of 2021. Not proud of these. I'm ashamed of these.

997
02:38:26,360 --> 02:38:31,020
Uh, here are your nominees, just like the best. Here are your nominees for the worst jokes

998
02:38:31,020 --> 02:38:39,750
of the year. That took more than five minutes to set up. Embarrassing. Here we go.

999
02:38:47,989 --> 02:38:58,100
And then we'll do, hmm, it's going to be a cake. Fuck the haters, right? Fuck the haters. I'm

1000
02:38:58,100 --> 02:39:03,510
putting marshmallows on my building. Fuck the haters. And they have to be different sizes too.

1001
02:39:03,510 --> 02:39:12,889
Oh my God. This is so omega ooey gooey. Dripping. That was cheesy. What, are people bored? Are you

1002
02:39:12,889 --> 02:39:18,569
bored? Oh, well I'm whatever. Look at this. I'm making a masterpiece. No, all right. I'm not,

1003
02:39:18,569 --> 02:39:23,879
I'm not messing with it anymore. I'm not messing with it anymore. It's over. I did it. There it is.

1004
02:39:23,879 --> 02:39:29,479
The Gronk's ice cream city hall. I don't know why I want to like make two cams. I have one of them

1005
02:39:29,479 --> 02:39:33,719
be blue and the other one be red and put them right next to each other transparent and like

1006
02:39:33,719 --> 02:39:37,639
give you like a 3d show. I'm coming at you. I'm coming at you.

1007
02:39:44,649 --> 02:40:05,610
Okay. I'm going to go for a bite. Oh my God. Why is this here? You can't have best and worst joke

1008
02:40:05,610 --> 02:40:23,420
of the year. It's so stupid. Oh my God. It's so good. You guys want to fuck with new viewers?

1009
02:40:23,420 --> 02:40:27,979
Okay. So I'm going to get a royalty free song. That's like with a bit, like a lot of drums.

1010
02:40:27,979 --> 02:40:33,260
I will, I'm going to full can also on best of the year be like fucking like playing like air drums

1011
02:40:33,260 --> 02:40:40,200
and like people get into it and shit. Look at how split of a community we really have.

1012
02:40:42,760 --> 02:40:47,879
It was people hated this, but they loved it on the other side. Right. It's so funny.

1013
02:40:56,969 --> 02:41:01,850
Okay. I will do a, I will do a welcome to German craft as the entire Griffin family. Hello,

1014
02:41:01,850 --> 02:41:06,569
ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to episode one of German craft, the series where I play Minecraft.

1015
02:41:07,049 --> 02:41:10,889
This is going to be a single player. Let's play. And I say, when I say let's play,

1016
02:41:10,889 --> 02:41:15,129
I use that term pretty loosely because I have a stupid idiot dumb ass in this game.

1017
02:41:15,770 --> 02:41:19,049
You're going to see lots of you. That's a fake one. All right. I'm starting to see residence

1018
02:41:19,049 --> 02:41:22,489
sleepers. I got to go. I have to get this done right now. I don't care. It's a billion off the

1019
02:41:22,489 --> 02:41:29,700
dead. I don't give a shit how it sounds. I'm seeing residents sleepers. I gotta go. Hello,

1020
02:41:29,700 --> 02:41:35,059
ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to episode one of German craft. This is fucking Jesus Christ.

1021
02:41:35,219 --> 02:41:37,780
Oh, one, two, three.

1022
02:41:44,260 --> 02:41:59,899
What's in there? I'm not sure. Oh my God. It's, it's Minecraft diamond. This is like what I see

1023
02:41:59,899 --> 02:42:05,979
when I look down in the bathtub. Okay. Like it's just like, Oh, there it is. A deformed penis.

1024
02:42:06,540 --> 02:42:11,260
That's not, this is like what your dick does when you just are sitting around hanging out in your

1025
02:42:11,260 --> 02:42:16,940
living room. Okay. This is what it looks like. It's like pushed up against your pants. All right.

1026
02:42:16,940 --> 02:42:22,139
I'm done. If you sit in the bathtub, if you're lying in the bathtub and you are lying back and

1027
02:42:22,139 --> 02:42:29,319
you look down, it's going to look like this. I'm sorry, but I have to do this. It's like,

1028
02:42:36,540 --> 02:42:44,379
what do you want me to say? That's TOS. That is a piece of frosting that I can't wait to never mind.

1029
02:42:48,170 --> 02:42:57,459
Oh shit. And then we'll do.

1030
02:43:02,629 --> 02:43:07,590
Fuck the haters, right? Fuck the haters. I didn't mean to click. I'm so sorry. I'm putting marshmallows

1031
02:43:07,590 --> 02:43:11,110
in my building. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'll fix it. I'll fix it.

1032
02:43:11,110 --> 02:43:19,799
Different sizes too. Oh my God. This is so omega ooey gooey. Just dripping. I didn't mean to click

1033
02:43:19,799 --> 02:43:25,319
that. God damn it. Are you bored? Oh, well, I'm whatever. I guess we're going to watch it again.

1034
02:43:25,319 --> 02:43:30,200
I'm making a mess. I'm so pissed. It was one more. I'm not messing with it anymore. It's over.

1035
02:43:30,200 --> 02:43:34,040
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I got it. I got it. There it is. The Gronk's ice cream city hall.

1036
02:43:37,620 --> 02:43:55,670
We'll get there. Hold on. I can't. Son of a. God damn it. I didn't mean to. I swear to God,

1037
02:43:55,670 --> 02:44:09,079
didn't mean to do that. While that's on, we have to get to the last part. Just played in VLC.

1038
02:44:11,110 --> 02:44:19,059
It'll take two seconds. Just relax. It's got five seconds. Relax.

1039
02:44:25,780 --> 02:44:29,219
I did not. I'm sorry. I promise. I did not mean to do that. I promise.

1040
02:44:29,219 --> 02:44:48,600
An idiot. I'll be on cam for a minute. Okay. It's in the background. That's fine.

1041
02:44:50,809 --> 02:45:00,309
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's fine. Sure. Minecraft series where I play it. Yep. I got to

1042
02:45:00,309 --> 02:45:24,600
go. Resident sleepers. Yep. Yep. He's still going. Okay. We saw that one. Okay. Okay. Okay.

1043
02:45:28,739 --> 02:45:33,459
The winner of the worst. I'll just tell you. Who cares? It was by a landslide.

1044
02:45:33,459 --> 02:45:49,559
It was by a goddamn landslide. Who cares? Wait, stop. Stop. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down.

1045
02:45:55,559 --> 02:46:20,360
Why won't it slow down? Oh my God. You piece of crap. It won't slow down. And your winner of worst

1046
02:46:20,360 --> 02:46:27,819
joke of the year, taking more than five minutes to set up with 26% of the vote.

1047
02:46:30,379 --> 02:46:36,299
Family guy. Germacraft. Y'all know it was going to win. And then bought a whopper and aided on

1048
02:46:36,299 --> 02:46:46,500
stream. It's insane. It's insane. Because the whopper, like it was like 20% in both worst and

1049
02:46:46,500 --> 02:46:53,420
best. That doesn't make any sense. And then the archaeology Minecraft diamond at 14%.

1050
02:46:55,590 --> 02:47:02,969
The family guy germacraft thing was a disaster. I'm embarrassed publicly. It was awful. Best

1051
02:47:02,969 --> 02:47:14,819
accident. It was best and worst. But yeah, but that just shows how like completely disconnected

1052
02:47:14,819 --> 02:47:19,239
everybody is here. Half of you thought it was the best. Half of you thought it was the worst.

1053
02:47:22,389 --> 02:47:35,450
Let's do two more. Two more categories. This is so fucked. Okay. These two. Don't even look at the

1054
02:47:35,450 --> 02:47:41,100
label of these two. There's no reason to look at the label. You don't have to look. It's the same

1055
02:47:41,100 --> 02:47:52,809
damn category. It doesn't matter. There were 200, 200 nominees for best and worst noise of the year.

1056
02:47:52,809 --> 02:48:01,450
The most we've ever seen. The most noise nominations ever by plus 100. There were so many

1057
02:48:01,450 --> 02:48:12,020
nominees. I have to like reel it in in 2022. I'm going to reel it in. I'm going to relax.

1058
02:48:12,020 --> 02:48:17,239
I'm going to try to stop, make it because I'm going to try to be a normal human being in 2022.

1059
02:48:17,239 --> 02:48:24,979
How much of a crazy person do you have to be? Do you have your best noise category? Have a hundred

1060
02:48:24,979 --> 02:48:31,700
and fucking 25 nominations. We had to drop it down to like 20 and that's all that's that's still

1061
02:48:31,700 --> 02:48:42,250
that's too many. That's way too many. Here are your nominees for best noise of the year. That

1062
02:48:42,250 --> 02:48:59,049
includes burps, sneezes, like yells, pukes. Best noise of the year. Here we go. Aaron, excuse me.

1063
02:49:06,360 --> 02:49:12,860
I think all whipped cream is great. I don't know what's the hate to whipped cream.

1064
02:49:13,340 --> 02:49:18,569
Am I muted right now? Oh, hey, you are. You were muted for a second. Sorry. What were you saying?

1065
02:49:18,569 --> 02:49:20,329
Yeah, I was just saying.

1066
02:49:21,850 --> 02:49:33,500
Hijack the data. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

1067
02:49:33,500 --> 02:49:41,110
What are you trying to do? Rip me off?

1068
02:49:43,909 --> 02:49:54,680
Don't get sucked into a war hole. Do a funny sound effect.

1069
02:49:56,760 --> 02:50:10,780
I'm going to stealth kill the mortar guy.

1070
02:50:13,129 --> 02:50:21,450
Oh my God. All right, we're fine. Come out here. Get rid of the rabbit.

1071
02:50:22,250 --> 02:50:32,120
Oh, what happened? No, I was trying to fill the dead air.

1072
02:50:36,149 --> 02:50:39,350
Now watch. She's going to come try to like kiss me and I'm going to go.

1073
02:50:42,629 --> 02:50:46,469
And I'm going to push her away. Watch. I'm not going to do anything. That's the quickest way to

1074
02:50:46,469 --> 02:50:53,909
get disinvited to anything else in the future is being in that general chat with like 15 people

1075
02:50:53,909 --> 02:50:58,870
and being like, Hey, hey, pick the beaver and that's the kind of the beaver goes.

1076
02:50:58,870 --> 02:51:01,989
If he breaks that down and then he goes on the corn.

1077
02:51:01,989 --> 02:51:05,430
And then I put the horse in there and they'd be like, all right,

1078
02:51:05,430 --> 02:51:08,549
you're like, okay, fucking can you stop like, can you leave the call? Like, stop.

1079
02:51:08,549 --> 02:51:11,270
We're trying to like set this up. Watch him go on the right side.

1080
02:51:12,379 --> 02:51:16,940
Oh, no. No, he did it. He did the same exact arrows that he got hit with.

1081
02:51:17,659 --> 02:51:19,579
Oh, la la. Damn it.

1082
02:51:19,579 --> 02:51:24,620
I don't have enough room.

1083
02:51:24,620 --> 02:51:30,110
He does this only for the power.

1084
02:51:30,110 --> 02:51:34,069
He got me killed.

1085
02:51:34,069 --> 02:51:59,120
Somebody came in here and like killed me and muted the microphone right by.

1086
02:51:59,120 --> 02:52:02,729
How?

1087
02:52:02,729 --> 02:52:04,090
Oh a burger.

1088
02:52:04,090 --> 02:52:09,229
Can you talk while inhaling at the same time?

1089
02:52:09,229 --> 02:52:10,229
Hi.

1090
02:52:10,229 --> 02:52:11,229
Nope.

1091
02:52:11,229 --> 02:52:23,969
Please don't.

1092
02:52:23,969 --> 02:52:29,629
So not to confuse you, that was best noise of the year.

1093
02:52:29,629 --> 02:52:46,659
The winner of best noise of 2021 deranged with laughter followed closely by lala at

1094
02:52:46,659 --> 02:52:54,690
10% deranged with 11% and fill the dead air with 10%.

1095
02:52:54,690 --> 02:52:59,659
This was so close, it was impossible to even just differentiate.

1096
02:52:59,659 --> 02:53:11,700
Lala lost by like 0.8% the deranged laughter one and then filled the dead air right after.

1097
02:53:11,700 --> 02:53:18,209
So pretend like you didn't hear the category, if you're like oh noise, best noise, yeah

1098
02:53:18,209 --> 02:53:21,049
don't matter.

1099
02:53:21,049 --> 02:53:24,850
Here's the worst noise of the year.

1100
02:53:24,850 --> 02:53:31,639
I would put your volume down like 10 to 20% I would say, maybe 5%.

1101
02:53:31,639 --> 02:53:34,870
Some of these are probably really annoying.

1102
02:53:34,870 --> 02:53:49,020
Here are the nominees for the worst noise of the year.

1103
02:53:49,020 --> 02:53:55,500
Alright now you pissed me off.

1104
02:53:55,500 --> 02:54:12,590
Wouldn't be the first time you abandoned the channel.

1105
02:54:12,590 --> 02:54:19,790
Kill it!

1106
02:54:19,790 --> 02:54:44,399
I'm basing the opinion of bringing the fox up, not because I want to be the contrarian,

1107
02:54:44,399 --> 02:54:54,899
but because of that video of the fox going like, that's such a cute video, I love it.

1108
02:55:03,700 --> 02:55:12,620
It just keeps going.

1109
02:55:12,620 --> 02:55:23,290
What's up dog?

1110
02:55:23,290 --> 02:55:39,649
You just made like the lemur behind me laugh, I forgot to tell you guys I got a lemur.

1111
02:55:39,770 --> 02:55:51,840
Oh here's every single mukbang video you've ever watched in your entire life.

1112
02:55:51,840 --> 02:56:00,889
What about people that were in the Jerma Rumble?

1113
02:56:00,889 --> 02:56:14,729
I don't think I have the other stones.

1114
02:56:14,729 --> 02:56:31,909
Yes, yes I'll get the stones, I'll go after those stones, yes of course I'll get the stones.

1115
02:56:32,149 --> 02:56:43,780
Hello hello hello hello hello, oh no!

1116
02:56:51,159 --> 02:56:52,760
Jesus, oh my god!

1117
02:56:52,760 --> 02:56:55,159
Go to the workshop at the back and buy the streaming function!

1118
02:57:03,700 --> 02:57:08,739
Wait, let me take a guess, is thrumming like this like

1119
02:57:08,739 --> 02:57:27,290
Is that what it might be?

1120
02:57:27,290 --> 02:57:32,540
Your winner of this year's Worst Noise of the Year.

1121
02:57:32,540 --> 02:57:43,649
I've got it right here.

1122
02:57:43,649 --> 02:57:47,760
Oh wow this was close.

1123
02:57:47,760 --> 02:57:49,950
My god.

1124
02:57:49,950 --> 02:57:55,260
There was a 37 vote difference.

1125
02:57:55,260 --> 02:58:04,260
With 16.6% of the vote, it's the Spampton Request Accepted.

1126
02:58:04,260 --> 02:58:13,319
Right after that was the Cursed Mukbang, 16.6% and 16.3%.

1127
02:58:13,319 --> 02:58:19,340
Very far away was Saucon D's Nuts.

1128
02:58:19,340 --> 02:58:22,090
That was a 37 vote difference.

1129
02:58:22,090 --> 02:58:29,329
By the way, something funny to note about the best and worst noise category, some of

1130
02:58:29,329 --> 02:58:40,280
the most skipped, 1270 people skipped this question.

1131
02:58:40,280 --> 02:58:41,280
Which is a lot of people.

1132
02:58:44,540 --> 02:58:47,420
Alright, let's get back to the rumble.

1133
02:58:47,420 --> 02:58:52,219
Nooooooo you know what, fuck it.

1134
02:58:52,219 --> 02:58:56,489
We got, we'll do two more.

1135
02:58:56,489 --> 02:58:58,760
Two more categories.

1136
02:58:58,760 --> 02:58:59,760
Two more categories.

1137
02:58:59,760 --> 02:59:06,059
Yeah, a bunch of, I mean would you want to take that test?

1138
02:59:06,059 --> 02:59:12,180
I don't want to listen to like 25 of this annoying dude's sounds.

1139
02:59:12,180 --> 02:59:14,409
It makes perfect sense.

1140
02:59:14,409 --> 02:59:17,209
Alright, we will do two more.

1141
02:59:17,209 --> 02:59:22,579
Cause there's still, oh my god there's like 12 more categories holy shit.

1142
02:59:22,579 --> 02:59:28,600
All right, coming up next is a popular one, very popular.

1143
02:59:28,600 --> 02:59:35,420
This is best one guy moment of the year, if you don't know what a one guy moment is.

1144
02:59:35,420 --> 02:59:44,069
A one guy moment is when somebody in chat derails the stream to a point where we spend

1145
02:59:44,069 --> 02:59:49,040
about five to 10 plus minutes potentially, even maybe less, maybe more, dealing with

1146
02:59:49,040 --> 02:59:51,040
the fact that this person derailed the stream.

1147
02:59:51,040 --> 02:59:57,799
It's the best chat kind of, I guess, chat message, chat derailment.

1148
02:59:57,799 --> 03:00:02,159
It's the best one guy moment of the year.

1149
03:00:02,159 --> 03:00:04,180
And there was a lot of great categories this year.

1150
03:00:04,180 --> 03:00:05,180
Holy smokes.

1151
03:00:05,180 --> 03:00:10,129
We'll see them right now.

1152
03:00:10,129 --> 03:00:39,459
No, wait, I don't have a Rubik's Cube.

1153
03:00:39,459 --> 03:00:44,180
Guys, I have no fucking idea how to do a Rubik's Cube.

1154
03:00:44,180 --> 03:00:49,000
I have absolutely no idea.

1155
03:00:49,000 --> 03:00:52,760
I've only picked them up and just mushed them around in my hands for two minutes.

1156
03:00:52,760 --> 03:00:54,680
I don't even know how it works.

1157
03:00:54,680 --> 03:00:56,479
I don't understand how it works.

1158
03:00:56,479 --> 03:00:58,120
We're on times two speed.

1159
03:00:58,120 --> 03:01:22,159
Is that what you say next game?

1160
03:01:22,159 --> 03:01:31,989
Yeah, let me load up Yakuza.

1161
03:01:31,989 --> 03:01:37,069
I'm just telling you that I finally ate in and out the way that I was told I was supposed

1162
03:01:37,069 --> 03:01:39,870
to quote order special the burger.

1163
03:01:39,870 --> 03:01:45,770
And it was better than just ordering it off the menu, which makes me want to put it down

1164
03:01:45,770 --> 03:01:48,739
here.

1165
03:01:48,739 --> 03:01:53,899
Even the animal style dick, please apologize for typing me up for 10 minutes.

1166
03:01:53,899 --> 03:01:56,700
All right, so the pre stream chat, I timed somebody over 10 minutes.

1167
03:01:56,700 --> 03:01:57,700
But hold on.

1168
03:01:58,420 --> 03:02:00,979
Yes, I apologize for timing you out for 10 minutes in pre stream.

1169
03:02:00,979 --> 03:02:03,180
But let's talk about the context first.

1170
03:02:03,180 --> 03:02:05,940
You asked me to play Destiny 2 PVP tomorrow.

1171
03:02:05,940 --> 03:02:08,879
Do you think that is that it?

1172
03:02:08,879 --> 03:02:10,239
Should I have timed you up for an hour?

1173
03:02:10,239 --> 03:02:12,079
My little sister is afraid of you.

1174
03:02:12,079 --> 03:02:16,340
Why is your little sister watching this stream?

1175
03:02:16,340 --> 03:02:19,829
Does your little sister hate me now?

1176
03:02:19,829 --> 03:02:20,829
I've got somebody here.

1177
03:02:20,829 --> 03:02:22,770
Come on over here.

1178
03:02:22,770 --> 03:02:28,110
It's me, Elmo.

1179
03:02:28,110 --> 03:02:29,540
Hey, Elmo.

1180
03:02:29,540 --> 03:02:30,540
What are you doing here?

1181
03:02:31,340 --> 03:02:37,340
Well, I want to teach everybody some sharing and how to share your milk.

1182
03:02:37,340 --> 03:02:38,340
She's 24.

1183
03:02:38,340 --> 03:02:46,190
Press the button next to it.

1184
03:02:46,190 --> 03:02:47,190
She's 24.

1185
03:02:47,190 --> 03:02:57,899
She really does look like a GTA mod.

1186
03:02:57,899 --> 03:02:58,899
It still makes me laugh.

1187
03:02:58,899 --> 03:03:03,360
Flying Dutchman sucks so bad.

1188
03:03:03,360 --> 03:03:05,360
GTA mod.

1189
03:03:05,360 --> 03:03:06,360
I can't get over it.

1190
03:03:06,360 --> 03:03:07,360
Okay, perfect game.

1191
03:03:07,360 --> 03:03:08,360
Come on.

1192
03:03:08,360 --> 03:03:11,360
Please designate a corner of the screen for bird watching videos.

1193
03:03:11,360 --> 03:03:15,940
Well, this is it.

1194
03:03:15,940 --> 03:03:17,940
The fucking bird video is distracting me.

1195
03:03:17,940 --> 03:03:20,629
I keep looking at it.

1196
03:03:20,629 --> 03:03:22,629
I keep looking over here at these birds.

1197
03:03:22,629 --> 03:03:23,629
Hey, get out of there.

1198
03:03:23,629 --> 03:03:24,629
That's not yours.

1199
03:03:24,629 --> 03:03:26,629
That's not for you.

1200
03:03:26,629 --> 03:03:28,629
Stop eating the bird's bird seed.

1201
03:03:28,629 --> 03:03:34,120
I'm more interested.

1202
03:03:34,120 --> 03:03:37,399
Wait.

1203
03:03:37,399 --> 03:03:38,399
He's like, hey, get out of here.

1204
03:03:38,399 --> 03:03:40,959
This is our bird team.

1205
03:03:40,959 --> 03:03:45,959
My absolute favorite part of Harry Potter was Voldemort's strange sounds he would make.

1206
03:03:45,959 --> 03:03:57,010
Did somebody make a compilation?

1207
03:03:57,010 --> 03:04:02,479
It's over Simpson.

1208
03:04:02,479 --> 03:04:06,479
It's not over Simpson.

1209
03:04:06,479 --> 03:04:19,159
Jerma, I would rather see you in the hospital than on TikTok.

1210
03:04:19,159 --> 03:04:22,360
That's so fucked up.

1211
03:04:22,360 --> 03:04:23,860
Holy shit, dude.

1212
03:04:23,860 --> 03:04:24,860
What the fuck?

1213
03:04:24,860 --> 03:04:26,040
I'm just going to read this.

1214
03:04:26,040 --> 03:04:27,040
Had a dream last night.

1215
03:04:27,040 --> 03:04:32,209
Jerma became like a mainstream celebrity by pioneering a new type of stream.

1216
03:04:32,209 --> 03:04:34,209
He would play a game like normal.

1217
03:04:34,209 --> 03:04:41,209
But every once in a while, he'd let chat keep the horror and put this like red and black

1218
03:04:41,209 --> 03:04:43,209
pulsating mass on screen.

1219
03:04:43,209 --> 03:04:46,840
Kind of looked like an AI generated image.

1220
03:04:46,840 --> 03:04:51,840
And the whole deal was that everyone who saw it thought it was the funniest thing they'd

1221
03:04:51,840 --> 03:04:52,840
ever seen.

1222
03:04:53,840 --> 03:04:57,840
But every time he'd show it, one viewer who saw it would die.

1223
03:04:57,840 --> 03:05:02,399
It ended when he showed it on stream and dropped dead.

1224
03:05:02,399 --> 03:05:08,399
The stream was left on for 72 hours to honor his memory.

1225
03:05:08,399 --> 03:05:16,399
It was dead quiet with just his body and a slowly pulsating red mass on screen beside

1226
03:05:16,399 --> 03:05:19,040
him.

1227
03:05:19,040 --> 03:05:21,040
Stop pretending to be interested.

1228
03:05:21,040 --> 03:05:23,040
You're not going to play any of these games.

1229
03:05:23,040 --> 03:05:28,040
You'll be too busy playing like fart simulator 2013.

1230
03:05:28,040 --> 03:05:29,040
I gotta hide.

1231
03:05:29,040 --> 03:05:30,040
I gotta get out and hide.

1232
03:05:30,040 --> 03:05:32,040
I'm on the ground.

1233
03:05:32,040 --> 03:05:39,379
Is this the Union?

1234
03:05:39,379 --> 03:05:41,379
We've unionized.

1235
03:05:41,379 --> 03:05:43,809
Cigarette?

1236
03:05:43,809 --> 03:05:52,000
It's just a used, a done cigarette.

1237
03:05:52,000 --> 03:05:55,600
No, that's a banana.

1238
03:05:55,600 --> 03:05:56,600
That's a banana.

1239
03:05:56,600 --> 03:06:00,639
Relax.

1240
03:06:00,639 --> 03:06:04,639
When it gets to this face, however, the TV froze.

1241
03:06:04,639 --> 03:06:10,809
So I tried turning it on and off to restart it, but the TV just won't turn off.

1242
03:06:10,809 --> 03:06:13,809
And it's stuck on this fucked up image of Jerma's face.

1243
03:06:13,809 --> 03:06:16,049
Okay, I don't know how that happened.

1244
03:06:16,049 --> 03:06:21,420
A couple hours pass, and I don't know why it took me a while, but I finally decide to

1245
03:06:21,420 --> 03:06:23,420
unplug the TV.

1246
03:06:23,420 --> 03:06:27,420
And then I realized that the face is permanently burned onto the screen.

1247
03:06:27,420 --> 03:06:29,420
Like it's just stuck there.

1248
03:06:29,420 --> 03:06:32,420
My parents aren't back until later in the night.

1249
03:06:32,420 --> 03:06:37,600
So now I'm freaking out trying to cover the screen so that they don't see the stupid

1250
03:06:37,600 --> 03:06:40,600
face burned onto their thousand dollar TV.

1251
03:06:40,600 --> 03:06:49,209
What do I do?

1252
03:06:49,209 --> 03:06:53,239
If only it was real.

1253
03:06:53,239 --> 03:07:03,739
Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of the best one guy moment of the year.

1254
03:07:03,739 --> 03:07:06,559
Oh, there are a lot of good ones too.

1255
03:07:06,559 --> 03:07:10,500
There were a lot of good ones.

1256
03:07:16,219 --> 03:07:24,159
With 27% of the vote, Peep the Horror.

1257
03:07:24,159 --> 03:07:28,610
Peep the Horror is your winner at 27%.

1258
03:07:28,610 --> 03:07:34,110
Jigsaw's Rubik's Cube at 17.6%.

1259
03:07:34,110 --> 03:07:42,350
And then right below it is the weird face burn-in at 17.3.

1260
03:07:42,350 --> 03:07:46,780
There was a 45 vote difference between 2 and 3.

1261
03:07:46,780 --> 03:07:50,040
They're all winners to me.

1262
03:07:50,040 --> 03:07:57,200
These are all winners to me.

1263
03:07:57,200 --> 03:08:00,200
The Rubik's Cube, that was some of the funniest shit I've ever seen in my life.

1264
03:08:00,200 --> 03:08:03,500
The burn-in shit was some of the funniest shit.

1265
03:08:03,500 --> 03:08:07,799
I will tell you right now, I know that people say this about their communities.

1266
03:08:07,799 --> 03:08:09,799
They say, oh man, my community is so funny.

1267
03:08:09,799 --> 03:08:16,549
Some of you guys just come up with some of the most fucked up funny shit I've ever heard of.

1268
03:08:16,549 --> 03:08:20,549
And it is an honor to be able to see it and laugh at it.

1269
03:08:20,549 --> 03:08:23,809
So let me just be clear about that.

1270
03:08:23,809 --> 03:08:26,809
We will do the rest of these in a little bit.

1271
03:08:26,809 --> 03:08:28,809
We'll go back to the rumble.

1272
03:08:28,809 --> 03:08:31,180
There are a few more matches to do.

1273
03:08:31,180 --> 03:08:34,149
Hopefully it doesn't crash.

1274
03:08:34,149 --> 03:08:36,149
Hopefully you can hear it.

1275
03:08:36,149 --> 03:08:42,840
Yeah, it's so hard to pick between what the community jokes that you guys make.

1276
03:08:42,840 --> 03:08:48,770
It's genuinely funny shit.

1277
03:08:48,770 --> 03:08:50,770
Let's do a couple more matches in the rumble.

1278
03:08:50,770 --> 03:08:52,649
Well, not the rumble.

1279
03:08:52,649 --> 03:08:53,649
The rumble's not till later.

1280
03:08:53,649 --> 03:08:54,649
We're not there yet.

1281
03:08:54,649 --> 03:08:56,850
Let us peep the horror.

1282
03:08:56,850 --> 03:08:57,850
Peep the Horror wins.

1283
03:08:57,850 --> 03:09:02,360
That's just such an insane concept to me.

1284
03:09:02,360 --> 03:09:08,989
What a wild thing to come up with.

1285
03:09:08,989 --> 03:09:10,989
Is this going to be a 7-hour stream?

1286
03:09:10,989 --> 03:09:14,989
We'll definitely do the Pacific countdown.

1287
03:09:14,989 --> 03:09:19,489
But I don't know how much longer after that.

1288
03:09:19,489 --> 03:09:20,489
I'm having a great time.

1289
03:09:20,489 --> 03:09:21,489
This is a fucking blast.

1290
03:09:21,489 --> 03:09:25,250
Hopefully you're having fun, too.

1291
03:09:25,250 --> 03:09:29,479
Let us continue with the rumble.

1292
03:09:29,479 --> 03:09:33,969
We have, I think, three more matches to do in the Germania card.

1293
03:09:33,969 --> 03:09:35,969
Oh, God.

1294
03:09:35,969 --> 03:09:36,969
Fuck this match.

1295
03:09:36,969 --> 03:09:38,979
Okay.

1296
03:09:38,979 --> 03:09:39,979
This is a ladder match.

1297
03:09:39,979 --> 03:09:42,979
This is a six-man ladder match.

1298
03:09:42,979 --> 03:09:48,930
This could go on for a very long time.

1299
03:09:48,930 --> 03:09:50,930
I hope it does not last that long.

1300
03:09:50,930 --> 03:09:57,010
Remember, tell me I'm funny now.

1301
03:09:57,010 --> 03:09:58,010
You're probably funny.

1302
03:09:58,010 --> 03:10:03,350
I don't know.

1303
03:10:03,350 --> 03:10:04,350
Is it mountain time in 30 minutes?

1304
03:10:04,350 --> 03:10:05,649
Yeah.

1305
03:10:05,649 --> 03:10:06,649
25 minutes.

1306
03:10:06,649 --> 03:10:11,479
30 minutes.

1307
03:10:11,479 --> 03:10:12,479
There were so many characters.

1308
03:10:12,479 --> 03:10:13,479
I had to just...

1309
03:10:13,479 --> 03:10:19,280
We had to do so many matches because you can only do 30 people in a rumble.

1310
03:10:19,280 --> 03:10:25,879
Almost all of the people in the rumble are people that you haven't seen yet.

1311
03:10:25,879 --> 03:10:28,879
I was like, damn, we have fucking 60 characters.

1312
03:10:28,879 --> 03:10:30,879
We have to put them in somewhere.

1313
03:10:30,879 --> 03:10:33,889
And this is where we put them in.

1314
03:10:33,889 --> 03:10:36,899
So without further ado, we got another match here.

1315
03:10:36,899 --> 03:10:37,899
We got a ladder match.

1316
03:10:37,899 --> 03:10:43,340
Six-man ladder match.

1317
03:10:43,340 --> 03:10:47,969
Here we go.

1318
03:10:47,969 --> 03:10:54,950
There were so many characters.

1319
03:10:54,950 --> 03:10:58,950
This is a ladder match, which means you have to climb to the top of the ladder,

1320
03:10:58,950 --> 03:11:04,569
grab the money in the bank, and this is between Rathu Flush,

1321
03:11:04,569 --> 03:11:11,799
of course, from the Flush family, the Sims family.

1322
03:11:11,799 --> 03:11:15,549
Here's Rathu Flush.

1323
03:11:15,549 --> 03:11:20,409
Quite a few Flushes.

1324
03:11:20,409 --> 03:11:30,909
Nice bugeyes, yeah.

1325
03:11:30,909 --> 03:11:35,959
There's Rathu Flush.

1326
03:11:35,959 --> 03:11:40,959
Who could possibly come in next?

1327
03:11:40,959 --> 03:11:49,100
I wonder if it's anybody else in the Flush family.

1328
03:11:49,100 --> 03:11:52,100
It could be the entire Flush family.

1329
03:11:52,100 --> 03:11:54,040
Could be.

1330
03:11:54,040 --> 03:11:56,040
Of course, that's Grunty Flush.

1331
03:11:56,040 --> 03:12:04,360
Where did he just go?

1332
03:12:04,360 --> 03:12:07,100
Never give up.

1333
03:12:07,100 --> 03:12:08,530
Okay.

1334
03:12:08,530 --> 03:12:09,530
Thanks, Grunty.

1335
03:12:09,530 --> 03:12:12,799
That's good advice.

1336
03:12:12,799 --> 03:12:25,579
Don't ever give up.

1337
03:12:25,579 --> 03:12:27,579
Grunty Flush, Rathu Flush.

1338
03:12:27,579 --> 03:12:33,469
You probably see where this is going.

1339
03:12:33,469 --> 03:12:42,239
There's Ratchet Flush.

1340
03:12:42,239 --> 03:12:59,219
Yeah, they're all 220 pounds.

1341
03:12:59,219 --> 03:13:05,510
It's to make sure nobody has an advantage in the actual matches.

1342
03:13:05,510 --> 03:13:08,809
Some are actually, they weigh a lot less.

1343
03:13:08,809 --> 03:13:17,360
Any other Flush family members we should be aware of?

1344
03:13:17,360 --> 03:13:24,120
Oh my God, that's Strong Henry Flush.

1345
03:13:24,120 --> 03:13:28,620
He was nominated Top Character of the Year.

1346
03:13:28,620 --> 03:13:32,120
I hope he dies in this match.

1347
03:13:32,120 --> 03:13:41,049
I hope somebody breaks his neck in this match.

1348
03:13:50,870 --> 03:13:52,870
Alright, fuck this guy. Let's go.

1349
03:13:52,870 --> 03:14:09,739
Who could forget Bumpy Flush?

1350
03:14:09,739 --> 03:14:10,739
The cat.

1351
03:14:10,739 --> 03:14:13,170
This just burped so loud.

1352
03:14:13,170 --> 03:14:17,690
This is the character I dropped the meteor on.

1353
03:14:17,690 --> 03:14:21,700
I dropped a meteor on Bumpy Flush accidentally.

1354
03:14:21,700 --> 03:14:36,040
Not on purpose, accidentally.

1355
03:14:36,040 --> 03:14:40,620
And finally, who could forget Sus Flush?

1356
03:14:40,620 --> 03:14:45,100
Or the sus guy?

1357
03:14:45,100 --> 03:14:47,530
Either one, who cares.

1358
03:14:47,530 --> 03:14:48,530
It doesn't matter.

1359
03:14:48,530 --> 03:14:50,530
Sus Flush.

1360
03:14:50,530 --> 03:15:02,360
I hope this does not go 40 goddamn minutes.

1361
03:15:02,360 --> 03:15:04,360
I'm hoping this is over in 10 minutes.

1362
03:15:04,360 --> 03:15:07,219
That would be ideal.

1363
03:15:07,219 --> 03:15:14,860
That'd be great.

1364
03:15:14,860 --> 03:15:18,860
Here we go, the six man ladder match between the sus family.

1365
03:15:18,860 --> 03:15:20,860
That's not them.

1366
03:15:20,860 --> 03:15:24,000
It's the Flush family.

1367
03:15:24,000 --> 03:15:30,000
Sus Flush, Grunty Flush, Ratchet Flush, Rathew Flush, Strong Henry Flush, Bumpy Flush.

1368
03:15:30,000 --> 03:15:33,520
Here they go.

1369
03:15:33,520 --> 03:15:36,520
The only way you can win this match if you climb to the top of the ladder,

1370
03:15:36,520 --> 03:15:39,520
grab that money in the bag briefcase.

1371
03:15:39,520 --> 03:15:42,399
The sus dynasty.

1372
03:15:42,399 --> 03:15:46,790
Already we have a few problems.

1373
03:15:46,790 --> 03:15:48,790
Sus Flush going after Strong Henry.

1374
03:15:48,790 --> 03:15:52,350
Gets double dropkick for his trouble.

1375
03:15:52,350 --> 03:15:56,229
No, you can't predict all four.

1376
03:15:56,229 --> 03:15:57,229
No, you can't.

1377
03:15:57,229 --> 03:16:03,899
This is from that dogshit Sims game I did.

1378
03:16:03,899 --> 03:16:09,229
Grunty, going for the ladder immediately.

1379
03:16:09,229 --> 03:16:10,229
Oh my goodness.

1380
03:16:10,229 --> 03:16:13,659
Bumpy Flush with a belly to back suplex.

1381
03:16:13,659 --> 03:16:17,840
I don't think they'll ever be a winner of this match.

1382
03:16:17,840 --> 03:16:18,840
I have to be honest.

1383
03:16:18,840 --> 03:16:24,559
This is shit mid card serpent bullshit.

1384
03:16:24,559 --> 03:16:28,719
Fuck.

1385
03:16:28,719 --> 03:16:35,579
Just be happy there's not six serpents for the love of God.

1386
03:16:35,579 --> 03:16:41,040
It's the entire slush family for God's sake.

1387
03:16:41,040 --> 03:16:50,360
Whatever the dumb name is, who cares?

1388
03:16:50,360 --> 03:16:54,000
I don't even know the names.

1389
03:16:54,000 --> 03:16:56,000
Bumpy is the cat.

1390
03:16:56,000 --> 03:16:59,000
Sus is that guy, me right there.

1391
03:16:59,000 --> 03:17:00,000
I think that's Rathew.

1392
03:17:00,000 --> 03:17:03,000
Is Rathew going to take it right now?

1393
03:17:03,000 --> 03:17:04,000
No, no, no.

1394
03:17:04,000 --> 03:17:05,000
Going up.

1395
03:17:05,000 --> 03:17:06,000
He could get it right now.

1396
03:17:06,000 --> 03:17:09,479
Rathew going for the belt right now.

1397
03:17:09,479 --> 03:17:13,899
Why is he giving me indicators?

1398
03:17:13,899 --> 03:17:14,899
I'm not playing.

1399
03:17:14,899 --> 03:17:19,000
I swear to God.

1400
03:17:19,000 --> 03:17:21,000
Oh, and down goes Rathew Flush.

1401
03:17:21,000 --> 03:17:24,000
Ratchet Flush has got the briefcase.

1402
03:17:24,000 --> 03:17:26,000
There's no way he gets it right now.

1403
03:17:26,000 --> 03:17:28,000
No way.

1404
03:17:28,000 --> 03:17:31,559
No way.

1405
03:17:31,559 --> 03:17:33,559
Somebody stop him.

1406
03:17:33,559 --> 03:17:34,559
Stop him right now.

1407
03:17:34,559 --> 03:17:35,559
Grunty.

1408
03:17:35,559 --> 03:17:39,559
Stop there and stop him from playing his weird minigame.

1409
03:17:39,559 --> 03:17:45,389
Thank goodness Grunty with a couple of abdomen punches.

1410
03:17:45,389 --> 03:17:47,389
I think Ratchet is through.

1411
03:17:47,389 --> 03:17:52,959
I don't know why the indicators are on screen.

1412
03:17:52,959 --> 03:17:54,959
I swear to God.

1413
03:17:54,959 --> 03:18:01,360
It's a fake match.

1414
03:18:01,360 --> 03:18:05,299
Now Sus Flush has the ladder.

1415
03:18:05,299 --> 03:18:07,920
Thinking about going up himself maybe.

1416
03:18:07,920 --> 03:18:08,920
No, strong Henry.

1417
03:18:08,920 --> 03:18:11,930
Voted best character of the year.

1418
03:18:11,930 --> 03:18:13,930
Going to show why it seems like.

1419
03:18:13,930 --> 03:18:15,930
No, no, no, no, Sus Flush.

1420
03:18:15,930 --> 03:18:18,299
A couple of elbows into his head.

1421
03:18:18,299 --> 03:18:21,120
There he goes over the top ropes.

1422
03:18:21,120 --> 03:18:25,120
Pumpy Flush gets a double dropkick and Ratchet Flush picks up.

1423
03:18:25,120 --> 03:18:28,120
No, he gets killed by strong Henry Flush.

1424
03:18:28,120 --> 03:18:32,569
No one's ever going to get this ladder up.

1425
03:18:32,569 --> 03:18:35,879
It's not going to happen.

1426
03:18:35,879 --> 03:18:38,829
I may as well skip this match.

1427
03:18:38,829 --> 03:18:44,829
Because there's not a chance in hell that this ladder goes up and somebody climbs it.

1428
03:18:44,829 --> 03:18:54,159
Prove I'm not cheating.

1429
03:18:54,159 --> 03:19:00,709
See?

1430
03:19:00,709 --> 03:19:08,079
Pumpy Flush takes a backhand to the back of the back by Sus Flush.

1431
03:19:08,079 --> 03:19:10,079
I'm actually, I wonder who wins this.

1432
03:19:10,079 --> 03:19:13,079
I have no idea who could possibly win this.

1433
03:19:13,079 --> 03:19:16,159
They all have such shit stats too.

1434
03:19:16,159 --> 03:19:19,479
I made sure of it.

1435
03:19:19,479 --> 03:19:22,479
As Sus Flush, I can't, indeed it's hard to say that after a bottle of champagne.

1436
03:19:22,479 --> 03:19:25,239
Give me a break.

1437
03:19:25,239 --> 03:19:28,600
Rathew Flush takes Ratchet Flush.

1438
03:19:28,600 --> 03:19:30,600
From the top turnbuckle in Grunty now.

1439
03:19:30,600 --> 03:19:32,600
Resting on the side here.

1440
03:19:32,600 --> 03:19:39,260
No one's going to win.

1441
03:19:39,260 --> 03:19:42,780
As Rathew and Ratchet are on the top rope.

1442
03:19:42,780 --> 03:19:44,780
Big suplex incoming, here it goes.

1443
03:19:44,780 --> 03:19:46,780
On his back, onto the ladder potentially.

1444
03:19:46,780 --> 03:19:47,780
Oh, there it is.

1445
03:19:47,780 --> 03:19:48,780
Huge.

1446
03:19:48,780 --> 03:19:54,840
Big pain there on Ratchet Flush.

1447
03:19:54,840 --> 03:20:04,739
Wait, why did that ladder fall?

1448
03:20:04,739 --> 03:20:06,739
As Bumpy grabs the ladder.

1449
03:20:06,739 --> 03:20:14,139
Oh no, Bumpy now going to maybe think about going to the top.

1450
03:20:14,139 --> 03:20:15,139
I think it's going to happen here.

1451
03:20:15,139 --> 03:20:18,139
Bumpy thinking about climbing that ladder to grab the money in the bank.

1452
03:20:18,139 --> 03:20:20,139
Is it possible?

1453
03:20:20,139 --> 03:20:23,620
Sus Flush is going to, no, has something to say about it.

1454
03:20:23,620 --> 03:20:24,620
A strong Henry.

1455
03:20:24,620 --> 03:20:29,079
Does anyone care about a single character in this match?

1456
03:20:29,079 --> 03:20:31,020
I don't.

1457
03:20:31,020 --> 03:20:36,159
A meteor could hit the arena right now.

1458
03:20:36,159 --> 03:20:39,459
And kill everybody in the ring.

1459
03:20:39,459 --> 03:20:40,459
And I would not care.

1460
03:20:40,459 --> 03:20:45,850
As strong Henry Flush takes the ladder away from Bumpy Flush.

1461
03:20:45,850 --> 03:20:47,860
Setting it up.

1462
03:20:47,860 --> 03:20:48,860
Trying to get to the top.

1463
03:20:48,860 --> 03:20:49,860
No!

1464
03:20:49,860 --> 03:20:51,860
Closing it down.

1465
03:20:51,860 --> 03:20:56,319
Setting it up again.

1466
03:20:56,319 --> 03:20:58,319
And not climbing it for some reason.

1467
03:20:58,319 --> 03:21:01,760
I think the fan favorite might be Bumpy Flush.

1468
03:21:01,760 --> 03:21:04,209
Nope.

1469
03:21:04,209 --> 03:21:06,389
Going to close it up again.

1470
03:21:06,389 --> 03:21:07,389
Nope.

1471
03:21:07,389 --> 03:21:08,389
Going to open it again.

1472
03:21:08,389 --> 03:21:10,389
I don't think it's in the right spot.

1473
03:21:10,389 --> 03:21:11,389
Strong Henry.

1474
03:21:11,389 --> 03:21:14,040
No, no.

1475
03:21:14,040 --> 03:21:16,040
You can't get it from there.

1476
03:21:16,040 --> 03:21:17,040
And I have to move it.

1477
03:21:17,040 --> 03:21:19,600
You're going to have to move it.

1478
03:21:19,600 --> 03:21:20,600
Yep.

1479
03:21:20,600 --> 03:21:21,600
There it is.

1480
03:21:21,600 --> 03:21:22,600
Okay.

1481
03:21:22,600 --> 03:21:23,600
Thank you.

1482
03:21:23,600 --> 03:21:26,690
Move it.

1483
03:21:26,690 --> 03:21:27,690
Just, okay.

1484
03:21:27,690 --> 03:21:32,069
Doesn't care.

1485
03:21:32,069 --> 03:21:33,069
Doesn't seem to mind.

1486
03:21:33,069 --> 03:21:34,069
Bumpy the Betrayer.

1487
03:21:34,069 --> 03:21:35,069
As Grunty has Sus on the ground.

1488
03:21:35,069 --> 03:21:37,370
Look at the kicks to the sternum.

1489
03:21:37,370 --> 03:21:41,489
Eye rake.

1490
03:21:41,489 --> 03:21:44,590
No, throwing him outside.

1491
03:21:44,590 --> 03:21:46,590
What is Ratchet doing up there?

1492
03:21:46,590 --> 03:21:51,639
I think strong, no, no, no.

1493
03:21:51,639 --> 03:21:52,639
Ratchet's going to go to the outside.

1494
03:21:52,639 --> 03:21:53,639
What are you?

1495
03:21:53,639 --> 03:21:55,639
Why would you do that?

1496
03:21:55,639 --> 03:22:01,700
Go into the ring where Strong Henry has got the money in the bank right now.

1497
03:22:01,700 --> 03:22:02,700
He's got it.

1498
03:22:02,700 --> 03:22:05,129
Let's see if he does this little weird puzzle.

1499
03:22:05,129 --> 03:22:07,129
Don't think so.

1500
03:22:07,129 --> 03:22:11,590
As Grunty and Strong Henry flush.

1501
03:22:11,590 --> 03:22:13,590
I don't know their names.

1502
03:22:13,590 --> 03:22:16,590
I killed them all in one day in Sims.

1503
03:22:16,590 --> 03:22:17,959
I don't give a shit.

1504
03:22:17,959 --> 03:22:19,959
I don't care if any of these guys die.

1505
03:22:19,959 --> 03:22:25,600
They could live or die and I don't care.

1506
03:22:25,600 --> 03:22:29,110
Strong Henry?

1507
03:22:29,110 --> 03:22:30,110
Bumpy Henry?

1508
03:22:30,110 --> 03:22:31,110
I don't know their names.

1509
03:22:31,110 --> 03:22:34,879
You guys all want the Sus guy to win anyways.

1510
03:22:34,879 --> 03:22:35,879
He's going up there right now.

1511
03:22:35,879 --> 03:22:38,879
And as the Sus guy reaches the top of the money in the bank.

1512
03:22:38,879 --> 03:22:41,120
Will Sus Flush win?

1513
03:22:41,120 --> 03:22:45,680
And win as best?

1514
03:22:45,680 --> 03:22:46,680
Flush?

1515
03:22:46,680 --> 03:22:47,680
Shit?

1516
03:22:47,680 --> 03:22:48,680
Dumb fucking loser family?

1517
03:22:48,680 --> 03:22:49,680
I don't know.

1518
03:22:49,680 --> 03:22:51,629
No.

1519
03:22:51,629 --> 03:22:52,629
Will he take it?

1520
03:22:52,629 --> 03:22:54,629
No, he will not.

1521
03:22:54,629 --> 03:22:59,110
That was so stupid.

1522
03:22:59,110 --> 03:23:02,559
Out goes Ratty Flush.

1523
03:23:02,559 --> 03:23:04,559
Strong Henry got Sus Flush by the neck.

1524
03:23:04,559 --> 03:23:05,559
Flipping up into the back.

1525
03:23:05,559 --> 03:23:06,559
And...

1526
03:23:06,559 --> 03:23:07,559
Whoa!

1527
03:23:07,559 --> 03:23:11,569
Make noises because you can't do commentary anymore.

1528
03:23:11,569 --> 03:23:15,479
As Bumpy Flush taking the ladder.

1529
03:23:15,479 --> 03:23:18,479
I think Bumpy might get it here.

1530
03:23:18,479 --> 03:23:19,909
Everybody's distracted.

1531
03:23:19,909 --> 03:23:20,909
Not in a great place.

1532
03:23:20,909 --> 03:23:24,909
But Bumpy is unhatching the latch on the money in the bank.

1533
03:23:24,909 --> 03:23:26,909
Will Bumpy Flush take it?

1534
03:23:26,909 --> 03:23:29,909
Ratchet and Strong Henry have something to say.

1535
03:23:29,909 --> 03:23:31,340
No.

1536
03:23:31,340 --> 03:23:35,870
No.

1537
03:23:35,870 --> 03:23:46,319
As Grunty throws Bumpy out of...

1538
03:23:46,319 --> 03:23:48,319
I don't even know their names.

1539
03:23:48,319 --> 03:23:49,319
I'm going to be honest.

1540
03:23:49,319 --> 03:23:54,950
As Green Guy takes Elf Guy and throws Green Guy out of the ring.

1541
03:23:54,950 --> 03:24:01,489
We've only got two left in the ring as Ratchet and Rathew.

1542
03:24:01,489 --> 03:24:05,370
I think Rathew has a good opportunity here.

1543
03:24:05,370 --> 03:24:07,680
To set the ladder up in the middle of the ring.

1544
03:24:07,680 --> 03:24:08,680
Looks like he does.

1545
03:24:08,680 --> 03:24:13,670
As Grunty rolls in.

1546
03:24:13,670 --> 03:24:21,860
Can somebody throw a grenade into the ring?

1547
03:24:21,860 --> 03:24:26,750
Can somebody throw a grenade?

1548
03:24:26,750 --> 03:24:38,120
As Bumpy Flush gets to the top of the ladder.

1549
03:24:38,120 --> 03:24:40,739
Grabbing the briefcase.

1550
03:24:40,739 --> 03:24:41,739
Will Bumpy...

1551
03:24:41,739 --> 03:24:44,750
What are you doing, you idiot?

1552
03:24:44,750 --> 03:24:46,750
Just grab it for God's sake.

1553
03:24:46,750 --> 03:24:49,079
Bumpy!

1554
03:24:49,079 --> 03:24:50,319
Two right hands.

1555
03:24:50,319 --> 03:24:51,319
Three right hands.

1556
03:24:51,319 --> 03:24:52,319
Raking home.

1557
03:24:52,319 --> 03:24:59,760
This is never going to end.

1558
03:24:59,760 --> 03:25:00,760
Alright.

1559
03:25:00,760 --> 03:25:04,670
Ratchet set it up and get the damn money.

1560
03:25:04,670 --> 03:25:06,670
Ratchet, Flush getting the ladder set up.

1561
03:25:06,670 --> 03:25:11,250
As Bumpy is not happy about it.

1562
03:25:11,250 --> 03:25:15,250
Six man ladder may have been not a great idea.

1563
03:25:15,250 --> 03:25:17,750
I will say.

1564
03:25:17,750 --> 03:25:20,120
Although Ratchet going up there now.

1565
03:25:20,120 --> 03:25:25,000
Not going to be able to do it as Sus Flush takes it.

1566
03:25:25,000 --> 03:25:27,319
Nope.

1567
03:25:27,319 --> 03:25:28,319
What?

1568
03:25:28,319 --> 03:25:32,479
That's Rathew?

1569
03:25:32,479 --> 03:25:44,180
Who cares?

1570
03:25:44,180 --> 03:25:52,920
As Bumpy Flush, I think Bumpy is the favorite.

1571
03:25:52,920 --> 03:25:57,700
Sus Flush over the top ropes by Rathew.

1572
03:25:57,700 --> 03:26:02,069
We've got Strong, we've got Grunty, we've got Rathew in the ring right now.

1573
03:26:02,069 --> 03:26:06,079
Who will set the ladder up and who will actually win this?

1574
03:26:06,079 --> 03:26:08,079
Grunty got the ladder now going in the middle of the ring.

1575
03:26:08,079 --> 03:26:12,069
Thinking about climbing the ropes.

1576
03:26:12,069 --> 03:26:13,239
No, don't you...

1577
03:26:13,239 --> 03:26:14,239
Oh my God.

1578
03:26:14,239 --> 03:26:15,239
What are you doing?

1579
03:26:15,239 --> 03:26:19,239
Grunty outside.

1580
03:26:19,239 --> 03:26:21,239
Why would you throw Bumpy back in the ring?

1581
03:26:21,239 --> 03:26:22,729
You don't want to put people...

1582
03:26:22,729 --> 03:26:24,729
You want to climb the ladder.

1583
03:26:24,729 --> 03:26:25,729
You don't want to put people back in the ring.

1584
03:26:25,729 --> 03:26:27,729
Get up there.

1585
03:26:27,729 --> 03:26:30,729
Grunty is thinking about winning here.

1586
03:26:30,729 --> 03:26:32,729
Will we see a victory?

1587
03:26:32,729 --> 03:26:33,729
I don't think so.

1588
03:26:33,729 --> 03:26:35,729
There are too many people.

1589
03:26:35,729 --> 03:26:38,729
The AI will always knock you down unless...

1590
03:26:38,729 --> 03:26:39,729
I guess not.

1591
03:26:39,729 --> 03:26:42,290
I don't know.

1592
03:26:42,290 --> 03:26:52,659
Bumpy, get up there and win, please.

1593
03:26:52,659 --> 03:26:54,479
Bumpy, I got a show to run.

1594
03:26:54,479 --> 03:26:55,479
You got to get up there.

1595
03:26:55,479 --> 03:26:57,479
Come on, Bumpy.

1596
03:26:57,479 --> 03:27:01,739
Bumpy, I got a show to move on with, so get up there.

1597
03:27:01,739 --> 03:27:04,739
Bumpy Flush the cat, the meatier cat that you all love.

1598
03:27:04,739 --> 03:27:08,920
And Ratchet Flush fighting now for the briefcase.

1599
03:27:08,920 --> 03:27:09,920
Who will get the briefcase?

1600
03:27:09,920 --> 03:27:10,920
I wonder what's it going to be?

1601
03:27:10,920 --> 03:27:11,920
Punch in the face to Bumpy.

1602
03:27:11,920 --> 03:27:13,920
Bumpy takes another right hand.

1603
03:27:13,920 --> 03:27:14,920
Two more.

1604
03:27:14,920 --> 03:27:17,090
Will Bumpy go down in a strong...

1605
03:27:17,090 --> 03:27:19,090
AI push over ladder.

1606
03:27:19,090 --> 03:27:22,090
AI, I fucking moron.

1607
03:27:22,090 --> 03:27:23,329
You get off.

1608
03:27:23,329 --> 03:27:24,639
Okay.

1609
03:27:24,639 --> 03:27:27,639
Now I push you over top rope and Bumpy win.

1610
03:27:27,639 --> 03:27:30,959
Bumpy's got it.

1611
03:27:30,959 --> 03:27:34,840
Bumpy's got the briefcase.

1612
03:27:34,840 --> 03:27:50,610
Someone set it up, please.

1613
03:27:50,610 --> 03:27:52,920
Lord, use the ladder as a weapon.

1614
03:27:52,920 --> 03:27:58,590
Stop just trying to climb it, you idiots.

1615
03:27:58,590 --> 03:28:00,590
Call the firing squad.

1616
03:28:00,590 --> 03:28:11,530
Grunty's finishing him.

1617
03:28:11,530 --> 03:28:15,239
Call an air strike him.

1618
03:28:15,239 --> 03:28:18,639
All right, Ratchet's going up now.

1619
03:28:18,639 --> 03:28:20,639
Finally, Ratchet's going to get the band.

1620
03:28:20,639 --> 03:28:21,639
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1621
03:28:21,639 --> 03:28:23,639
Bumpy's underneath there.

1622
03:28:23,639 --> 03:28:28,239
I have no idea who wins this.

1623
03:28:28,239 --> 03:28:32,579
No idea.

1624
03:28:32,579 --> 03:28:44,040
I think Ratchet's got it.

1625
03:28:44,040 --> 03:28:48,899
It's never going to end.

1626
03:28:48,899 --> 03:28:50,899
It's never going to end.

1627
03:28:50,899 --> 03:28:52,899
I think I have to intervene.

1628
03:28:52,899 --> 03:28:53,899
It's not going to end.

1629
03:28:53,899 --> 03:28:57,840
I have to intervene because I don't think it's going to end.

1630
03:28:57,840 --> 03:29:04,600
As Grunty sets the ladder up, it's Bumpy now.

1631
03:29:04,600 --> 03:29:06,600
Outside the ring, Grunty go.

1632
03:29:06,600 --> 03:29:09,420
Go, get it.

1633
03:29:09,420 --> 03:29:10,420
Complete it.

1634
03:29:10,420 --> 03:29:11,420
End it.

1635
03:29:11,420 --> 03:29:14,850
As Grunty, no, Strong Henry has something to say about it.

1636
03:29:14,850 --> 03:29:17,850
Potentially, no.

1637
03:29:17,850 --> 03:29:19,850
I don't think so.

1638
03:29:19,850 --> 03:29:23,030
Might get up there in a fast enough time.

1639
03:29:23,030 --> 03:29:26,030
And there goes Grunty falling back down.

1640
03:29:26,030 --> 03:29:29,030
No, stop pushing the ladder over you dickheads.

1641
03:29:29,030 --> 03:29:31,030
Oh, my God.

1642
03:29:31,030 --> 03:29:39,030
Someone please win.

1643
03:29:39,030 --> 03:29:42,680
This is so sus.

1644
03:29:42,680 --> 03:29:44,170
Okay.

1645
03:29:44,170 --> 03:29:51,379
Throw dice in the air to find out who wins.

1646
03:29:51,379 --> 03:29:54,180
Because I don't know.

1647
03:29:54,180 --> 03:29:57,059
Oh, Matthew.

1648
03:29:57,059 --> 03:29:58,680
Stop.

1649
03:29:58,680 --> 03:30:00,049
Walk.

1650
03:30:00,049 --> 03:30:02,930
You're having a lot of trouble right now.

1651
03:30:02,930 --> 03:30:05,489
You're having a lot of trouble.

1652
03:30:05,489 --> 03:30:08,489
I wish you would end it, but you just won't.

1653
03:30:08,489 --> 03:30:11,500
Yeah, okay.

1654
03:30:11,500 --> 03:30:14,379
You could grab the ladder and set it up.

1655
03:30:14,379 --> 03:30:16,379
Maybe climb up there and grab the bunny in the bank

1656
03:30:16,379 --> 03:30:19,379
and we could do the next few awards.

1657
03:30:19,379 --> 03:30:21,379
Or you could just get...

1658
03:30:21,379 --> 03:30:24,319
Okay.

1659
03:30:24,319 --> 03:30:32,170
There are other weapons they could use, too.

1660
03:30:32,170 --> 03:30:36,010
Someone said, this is awesome.

1661
03:30:36,010 --> 03:30:37,010
All right.

1662
03:30:37,010 --> 03:30:40,659
Wait.

1663
03:30:40,659 --> 03:30:46,870
Strong Henry Flush going to the top,

1664
03:30:46,870 --> 03:30:48,870
trying to grab the money in the bank.

1665
03:30:48,870 --> 03:30:49,870
Will he get it?

1666
03:30:49,870 --> 03:30:52,799
He's got his hands on it.

1667
03:30:52,799 --> 03:30:53,799
He's got his hands on it.

1668
03:30:53,799 --> 03:30:55,040
He got it.

1669
03:30:55,040 --> 03:30:56,040
He got it.

1670
03:30:56,040 --> 03:30:58,040
Strong Henry Flush is your winner.

1671
03:30:58,040 --> 03:31:01,620
Didn't win best character of the year,

1672
03:31:01,620 --> 03:31:05,620
but won in this match.

1673
03:31:05,620 --> 03:31:07,620
Congratulations, Strong Henry Flush.

1674
03:31:07,620 --> 03:31:08,620
Man, what an upset.

1675
03:31:08,620 --> 03:31:12,739
It could have been Matthew.

1676
03:31:12,739 --> 03:31:14,739
It could have been Ratchet two times.

1677
03:31:14,739 --> 03:31:23,399
This is what we call delete six characters from the Rumble.

1678
03:31:23,399 --> 03:31:27,959
Because there's like 30 new characters you haven't seen in the Rumble.

1679
03:31:27,959 --> 03:31:32,510
Okay.

1680
03:31:32,510 --> 03:31:33,510
Let's go to the next one.

1681
03:31:33,510 --> 03:31:34,510
Why not?

1682
03:31:34,510 --> 03:31:39,329
Let's go.

1683
03:31:39,329 --> 03:31:40,329
We got so many more categories.

1684
03:31:40,329 --> 03:31:41,329
There's so many more.

1685
03:31:41,329 --> 03:31:42,329
Oh, this one's going to be big.

1686
03:31:42,329 --> 03:31:45,959
This is a Tornado Tag Steel Cage match.

1687
03:31:45,959 --> 03:31:48,959
And I am very interested in this one.

1688
03:31:48,959 --> 03:31:50,260
I'm locked in.

1689
03:31:50,260 --> 03:31:52,260
I'm laser focused on this one.

1690
03:31:52,260 --> 03:31:58,360
New Year coming up for Mountain Central.

1691
03:31:58,360 --> 03:31:59,360
What is it?

1692
03:31:59,360 --> 03:32:02,079
Mountain Time?

1693
03:32:02,079 --> 03:32:03,700
Mountain Time?

1694
03:32:03,700 --> 03:32:04,700
We'll get them all.

1695
03:32:04,700 --> 03:32:07,799
Fuck it.

1696
03:32:07,799 --> 03:32:08,799
Let's go.

1697
03:32:08,799 --> 03:32:14,959
Can you punish Rathew?

1698
03:32:14,959 --> 03:32:15,959
He's already punished he exists.

1699
03:32:15,959 --> 03:32:16,959
There are 30,000 people here right now.

1700
03:32:16,959 --> 03:32:20,000
My God.

1701
03:32:20,000 --> 03:32:23,219
All right.

1702
03:32:23,219 --> 03:32:24,219
Tornado Tag Steel Cage.

1703
03:32:24,219 --> 03:32:26,219
This is a food related match.

1704
03:32:26,219 --> 03:32:32,090
Should we wait till the New Year for Mountain?

1705
03:32:32,090 --> 03:32:37,469
There are only two matches after this.

1706
03:32:37,469 --> 03:32:38,469
We're getting close.

1707
03:32:38,469 --> 03:32:40,469
We're like another hour or two out.

1708
03:32:40,469 --> 03:32:43,239
I'll wait.

1709
03:32:43,239 --> 03:32:44,239
All right.

1710
03:32:44,239 --> 03:32:49,450
Let's wait.

1711
03:32:49,450 --> 03:32:50,450
Let's wait.

1712
03:32:50,450 --> 03:32:51,450
Let's wait.

1713
03:32:51,450 --> 03:32:59,860
So this is for Mountain Time coming up here.

1714
03:32:59,860 --> 03:33:00,860
Nobody lives in Mountain Time.

1715
03:33:00,860 --> 03:33:05,489
Lots of people live in Mountain Time.

1716
03:33:05,489 --> 03:33:06,489
Come on.

1717
03:33:06,489 --> 03:33:08,690
Here we go.

1718
03:33:08,690 --> 03:33:15,219
Two minutes till New Year's Mountain Time.

1719
03:33:15,219 --> 03:33:19,719
It's just a mountain.

1720
03:33:19,719 --> 03:33:22,440
What is Mountain?

1721
03:33:22,440 --> 03:33:24,440
What states are in Mountain Time?

1722
03:33:24,440 --> 03:33:32,200
Arizona?

1723
03:33:32,200 --> 03:33:37,350
Colorado?

1724
03:33:37,350 --> 03:33:42,280
Oh, who fucking cares about Mountain Time?

1725
03:33:42,280 --> 03:33:44,159
Fuck it.

1726
03:33:45,159 --> 03:33:48,159
Midnight in Mountain Time.

1727
03:33:48,159 --> 03:33:57,969
And all the 1200 people that live in Mountain Time.

1728
03:33:57,969 --> 03:33:59,969
Happy New Year to Mountain Time.

1729
03:33:59,969 --> 03:34:04,219
I'm kidding.

1730
03:34:04,219 --> 03:34:05,219
We'll wait.

1731
03:34:05,219 --> 03:34:06,219
Just wait.

1732
03:34:06,219 --> 03:34:18,280
One minute.

1733
03:34:18,280 --> 03:34:22,670
And then we got we got Pacific right after in less than an hour.

1734
03:34:22,670 --> 03:34:30,239
Bunch of what?

1735
03:34:30,239 --> 03:34:35,920
I'm on like a fucking McDonald's double cheeseburger right now.

1736
03:34:35,920 --> 03:34:36,920
So bad.

1737
03:34:36,920 --> 03:34:40,649
All right.

1738
03:34:40,649 --> 03:34:42,649
30 seconds until Mountain Time New Year's.

1739
03:34:42,649 --> 03:34:43,649
Let's count it down.

1740
03:34:43,649 --> 03:34:46,620
Let's get it.

1741
03:34:46,620 --> 03:34:47,620
You skipped Central?

1742
03:34:47,620 --> 03:34:48,620
No, I didn't.

1743
03:34:48,620 --> 03:34:51,719
We did Central.

1744
03:34:51,719 --> 03:34:54,110
Here we go.

1745
03:34:54,110 --> 03:34:56,049
All you Mountainers.

1746
03:34:56,049 --> 03:34:57,049
Ten seconds.

1747
03:34:57,049 --> 03:34:59,379
Ten.

1748
03:34:59,379 --> 03:35:00,379
Nine.

1749
03:35:00,379 --> 03:35:01,799
Eight.

1750
03:35:01,799 --> 03:35:02,799
Seven.

1751
03:35:02,799 --> 03:35:03,799
Six.

1752
03:35:03,799 --> 03:35:04,799
Five.

1753
03:35:04,799 --> 03:35:05,799
Four.

1754
03:35:05,799 --> 03:35:06,799
Three.

1755
03:35:06,799 --> 03:35:07,799
Two.

1756
03:35:07,799 --> 03:35:11,549
Happy New Year Mountain Time.

1757
03:35:11,549 --> 03:35:44,090
The next match coming up here is a big one.

1758
03:35:44,090 --> 03:35:46,969
Food related like I said before.

1759
03:35:46,969 --> 03:35:52,579
Let me make sure this is on the screen so you can see it.

1760
03:35:52,579 --> 03:35:53,579
Oh!

1761
03:35:53,579 --> 03:35:54,579
Link!

1762
03:35:54,579 --> 03:35:55,819
Fuck it.

1763
03:35:55,819 --> 03:35:59,040
Who cares?

1764
03:35:59,040 --> 03:36:09,180
Who gives a shit?

1765
03:36:09,180 --> 03:36:10,180
Oh, that was Gordon Ramsay.

1766
03:36:10,180 --> 03:36:14,250
The guy that's going to get us all banned from Twitch.

1767
03:36:14,250 --> 03:36:19,479
The guy that's going to get all our channels shut down.

1768
03:36:19,479 --> 03:36:29,549
The Easy Bake Oven and Gordon Ramsay.

1769
03:36:29,549 --> 03:36:36,520
There's the Easy Bake Oven.

1770
03:36:36,520 --> 03:36:37,520
Nice one, Ron.

1771
03:36:37,520 --> 03:36:42,450
Was the Easy Bake Oven 2021?

1772
03:36:42,450 --> 03:36:45,450
No, but it made the most sense to pair with Gordon Ramsay.

1773
03:36:45,450 --> 03:36:57,440
This game sucks.

1774
03:36:57,440 --> 03:36:58,440
Play NFL.

1775
03:36:58,440 --> 03:37:00,440
No, we got Gordon Ramsay.

1776
03:37:00,440 --> 03:37:02,440
All the way from Hell's Kitchen.

1777
03:37:02,440 --> 03:37:03,440
California.

1778
03:37:03,440 --> 03:37:06,920
Las Vegas.

1779
03:37:06,920 --> 03:37:07,920
Wellington.

1780
03:37:07,920 --> 03:37:08,920
It's unbelievable.

1781
03:37:08,920 --> 03:37:12,760
Don't mess with the dough.

1782
03:37:12,760 --> 03:37:14,760
Don't send him a TikTok.

1783
03:37:14,760 --> 03:37:16,760
Showing you messing with his Wellington.

1784
03:37:16,760 --> 03:37:17,760
What are you doing to my Wellington?

1785
03:37:17,760 --> 03:37:18,760
Don't do that.

1786
03:37:18,760 --> 03:37:25,590
Going to get us all cancelled on Twitch.

1787
03:37:25,590 --> 03:37:35,760
This is a cage match, by the way.

1788
03:37:35,760 --> 03:37:43,750
They ain't getting out.

1789
03:37:43,750 --> 03:37:46,750
So Gordon Ramsay and the Easy Bake Oven versus the McRiddler.

1790
03:37:46,750 --> 03:37:52,440
Huge fast food fan.

1791
03:37:52,440 --> 03:37:55,000
Big into McDonald's.

1792
03:37:55,000 --> 03:37:56,000
Wendy's.

1793
03:37:56,000 --> 03:37:57,000
Burger King.

1794
03:37:57,000 --> 03:38:03,280
Big Burger King fan himself.

1795
03:38:03,280 --> 03:38:12,659
There's the McRiddler from Saints Row 2.

1796
03:38:12,659 --> 03:38:17,590
His partner is none other than...

1797
03:38:17,590 --> 03:38:18,590
You probably saw it.

1798
03:38:18,590 --> 03:38:19,590
I leaked it for a second.

1799
03:38:19,590 --> 03:38:22,399
But the point still stands.

1800
03:38:22,399 --> 03:38:24,899
That's the Burger King Long Chicken Sandwich.

1801
03:38:24,899 --> 03:38:32,680
That's the only thing you should order at Burger King.

1802
03:38:32,680 --> 03:38:35,370
Everything else at Burger King sucks.

1803
03:38:35,370 --> 03:38:36,370
Absolute asshole.

1804
03:38:36,370 --> 03:38:39,930
There's two menu items at Burger King that you should order.

1805
03:38:39,930 --> 03:38:41,930
This is one of them.

1806
03:38:41,930 --> 03:38:46,670
The other one is just their french fries.

1807
03:38:46,670 --> 03:38:49,969
Nothing else on that whole menu is good.

1808
03:38:49,969 --> 03:38:55,309
I'm not going to lie to you. I have to be real.

1809
03:38:55,309 --> 03:38:58,309
But the Long Chicken Burger King Sandwich,

1810
03:38:58,309 --> 03:38:59,309
and their french fries,

1811
03:38:59,309 --> 03:39:01,309
and their onion rings,

1812
03:39:01,309 --> 03:39:04,440
get them up to a C tier.

1813
03:39:04,440 --> 03:39:05,440
Or a B tier, at least.

1814
03:39:05,440 --> 03:39:14,040
The only way you win this match is if you escape the ring.

1815
03:39:14,040 --> 03:39:15,659
No pins.

1816
03:39:15,659 --> 03:39:19,479
No knockouts.

1817
03:39:19,479 --> 03:39:21,479
You gotta climb that cage and get out.

1818
03:39:21,479 --> 03:39:30,610
Close the cage down on our four combatants.

1819
03:39:30,610 --> 03:39:31,610
Let's see what happens.

1820
03:39:31,610 --> 03:39:32,610
Gordon Ramsay, Easy Bake Oven,

1821
03:39:32,610 --> 03:39:35,979
Long Chicken Sandwich, and the McRiddler.

1822
03:39:35,979 --> 03:39:37,979
Somebody has to get out.

1823
03:39:37,979 --> 03:39:48,610
You just have to escape.

1824
03:39:48,610 --> 03:39:53,989
I thought he threw him over the edge.

1825
03:39:53,989 --> 03:39:59,059
Long Chicken Sandwich is already going up there.

1826
03:39:59,059 --> 03:40:02,059
McRiddler and the Long Chicken are leaving already.

1827
03:40:02,059 --> 03:40:04,809
JKJ...

1828
03:40:04,809 --> 03:40:06,809
I'm getting indicators already.

1829
03:40:06,809 --> 03:40:12,459
I'm not playing the game as they're trying to both leave at the same time.

1830
03:40:12,459 --> 03:40:15,280
Gordon Ramsay not going to have that though.

1831
03:40:15,280 --> 03:40:16,280
Or the Easy Bake Oven.

1832
03:40:16,280 --> 03:40:21,239
One could say they're in a gigantic oven.

1833
03:40:21,239 --> 03:40:23,319
Closed.

1834
03:40:23,319 --> 03:40:26,629
Afraid.

1835
03:40:26,629 --> 03:40:30,579
Trying to get out of this oven.

1836
03:40:30,579 --> 03:40:34,229
Juan Gordo.

1837
03:40:34,229 --> 03:40:38,040
Yep, Gordon has a big advantage here.

1838
03:40:38,040 --> 03:40:44,350
The last week or two he's had over 430,000 concurrent viewers on Twitch.

1839
03:40:44,350 --> 03:40:46,350
He's got a lot of power behind him.

1840
03:40:46,350 --> 03:40:52,149
He's got a lot of momentum behind him.

1841
03:40:52,149 --> 03:40:55,450
Although I'm not really sure that can fight against the McRiddler.

1842
03:40:55,450 --> 03:40:59,399
Who had...

1843
03:40:59,399 --> 03:41:01,639
A month ago.

1844
03:41:01,639 --> 03:41:03,639
16,000 concurrent viewers.

1845
03:41:03,639 --> 03:41:04,639
That's pretty good.

1846
03:41:04,639 --> 03:41:05,639
That's pretty good.

1847
03:41:05,639 --> 03:41:06,639
That's pretty good.

1848
03:41:06,639 --> 03:41:08,959
Trying to get out.

1849
03:41:08,959 --> 03:41:12,840
Immediately can't get out.

1850
03:41:12,840 --> 03:41:15,489
Has the long...

1851
03:41:15,489 --> 03:41:16,489
No, Gordon now going out.

1852
03:41:16,489 --> 03:41:18,670
Trying to climb out.

1853
03:41:18,670 --> 03:41:21,670
Long Chicken Sandwich gets him by the foot.

1854
03:41:21,670 --> 03:41:24,670
Throws him into that rough steel cage.

1855
03:41:24,670 --> 03:41:27,670
There he goes in his Hell's Kitchen garb.

1856
03:41:27,670 --> 03:41:32,340
The McRiddler must be so sweaty.

1857
03:41:32,340 --> 03:41:39,120
The McChicken is too tall.

1858
03:41:39,120 --> 03:41:45,819
Up in the air, Hurricane Rana onto the Easy Bake oven.

1859
03:41:45,819 --> 03:41:47,819
20 community subs from Mr. Sark.

1860
03:41:47,819 --> 03:41:49,819
Mr. Sark, how the fuck are you?

1861
03:41:49,819 --> 03:41:51,510
Wait a minute.

1862
03:41:51,510 --> 03:41:55,750
We have two people on opposite teams trying to get out at the same time.

1863
03:41:55,750 --> 03:41:57,750
Will one of them get out?

1864
03:41:57,750 --> 03:41:59,750
They have free reign.

1865
03:41:59,750 --> 03:42:01,750
Who can climb faster?

1866
03:42:01,750 --> 03:42:05,750
Will Gordon Ramsay get out or will the Long Chicken Sandwich get out first?

1867
03:42:05,750 --> 03:42:07,920
Why would you punch him out when he's stupid?

1868
03:42:07,920 --> 03:42:09,920
Pull him back into the ring.

1869
03:42:09,920 --> 03:42:12,479
Gordon Ramsay going under the top rubs.

1870
03:42:12,479 --> 03:42:13,479
No.

1871
03:42:13,479 --> 03:42:14,479
Oh, this is bad.

1872
03:42:14,479 --> 03:42:17,479
Long Chicken Sandwich making his way over McRiddler.

1873
03:42:17,479 --> 03:42:19,479
Has got Gordon Ramsay.

1874
03:42:19,479 --> 03:42:22,479
Who is going to go over first?

1875
03:42:22,479 --> 03:42:23,979
Gordon can't.

1876
03:42:23,979 --> 03:42:25,979
McRiddler is distracting Gordon Ramsay.

1877
03:42:25,979 --> 03:42:28,979
As Long Chicken Sandwich is going over.

1878
03:42:28,979 --> 03:42:31,280
Easy Bake oven now has...

1879
03:42:31,280 --> 03:42:32,280
Oh, it's over.

1880
03:42:32,280 --> 03:42:33,280
That's it. It's over.

1881
03:42:33,280 --> 03:42:35,590
You cannot come back. That's it.

1882
03:42:35,590 --> 03:42:39,079
Long Chicken Sandwich gets over the edge.

1883
03:42:39,079 --> 03:42:40,520
Which...

1884
03:42:40,520 --> 03:42:42,950
Why is it not over?

1885
03:42:42,950 --> 03:42:46,760
Wait, the McRiddler has to get over there too.

1886
03:42:46,760 --> 03:42:49,579
Oh, shit.

1887
03:42:49,579 --> 03:42:55,430
They both have to get over the ropes.

1888
03:42:55,430 --> 03:42:56,430
Gordon, what are you doing?

1889
03:42:56,430 --> 03:42:57,430
No, no, no, no. Go over.

1890
03:42:57,430 --> 03:42:58,430
Go over. What are you doing?

1891
03:42:58,430 --> 03:43:03,799
Don't come back in.

1892
03:43:03,799 --> 03:43:05,799
I thought only one had to make it across.

1893
03:43:05,799 --> 03:43:06,799
No.

1894
03:43:06,799 --> 03:43:08,799
They both have to go.

1895
03:43:08,799 --> 03:43:11,940
Still fighting for his life.

1896
03:43:11,940 --> 03:43:12,940
Gordon trying to get over the top ropes.

1897
03:43:12,940 --> 03:43:15,940
Will he get over there still?

1898
03:43:15,940 --> 03:43:17,940
Oh, this is going to get very interesting.

1899
03:43:17,940 --> 03:43:22,520
Gordon Ramsay, I think, made his way over into the cage.

1900
03:43:22,520 --> 03:43:24,520
That's it.

1901
03:43:24,520 --> 03:43:29,600
It just now comes down to these two in the middle of the ring.

1902
03:43:29,600 --> 03:43:31,600
Gordon Ramsay definitely making it over.

1903
03:43:31,600 --> 03:43:33,600
Easy Bake oven now trying to climb up.

1904
03:43:33,600 --> 03:43:36,239
No.

1905
03:43:36,239 --> 03:43:37,239
This is going to be tough.

1906
03:43:37,239 --> 03:43:39,239
I have no idea who's going to win.

1907
03:43:39,239 --> 03:43:40,870
Ramsay out.

1908
03:43:40,870 --> 03:43:41,870
Long Chicken out.

1909
03:43:41,870 --> 03:43:47,600
McRiddler on the way out.

1910
03:43:47,600 --> 03:43:53,239
Will we see an end to this match right now?

1911
03:43:53,239 --> 03:43:57,799
McRiddler getting his leg over the top of the cage.

1912
03:43:58,799 --> 03:44:01,610
Easy Bake oven now climbing up.

1913
03:44:01,610 --> 03:44:02,610
You've got to pull him back.

1914
03:44:02,610 --> 03:44:03,610
Don't punch him.

1915
03:44:03,610 --> 03:44:04,610
Pull him back.

1916
03:44:04,610 --> 03:44:07,409
Oh, shit.

1917
03:44:07,409 --> 03:44:10,040
Oh, what an upset.

1918
03:44:10,040 --> 03:44:15,620
If the Easy Bake oven pulls him over, this is a huge deal.

1919
03:44:15,620 --> 03:44:23,110
Both going at the same exact time.

1920
03:44:23,110 --> 03:44:25,239
No.

1921
03:44:25,239 --> 03:44:26,239
Start fighting.

1922
03:44:26,239 --> 03:44:27,239
Punch, push.

1923
03:44:27,239 --> 03:44:29,510
What are you doing?

1924
03:44:29,510 --> 03:44:32,510
Oh, they're on the top, sitting, straddling the top of the cage.

1925
03:44:32,510 --> 03:44:34,510
Who's going to win?

1926
03:44:34,510 --> 03:44:35,510
The McRiddler.

1927
03:44:35,510 --> 03:44:38,069
The Easy Bake oven.

1928
03:44:38,069 --> 03:44:39,069
What are they?

1929
03:44:39,069 --> 03:44:42,969
It's too tense.

1930
03:44:42,969 --> 03:44:48,579
Be careful you don't knock your opponent to the left because they will win.

1931
03:44:48,579 --> 03:44:50,649
I have no...

1932
03:44:50,649 --> 03:44:52,649
Oh, that's it.

1933
03:44:52,649 --> 03:44:53,649
That's it.

1934
03:44:53,649 --> 03:45:00,629
Long Chicken Sandwich and the McRiddler have won this.

1935
03:45:00,629 --> 03:45:06,000
Unless a New Year's miracle happens, I don't think we're going to see anything else.

1936
03:45:06,000 --> 03:45:11,620
McRiddler and Long Chicken Sandwich have beaten Gordon Ramsay in the Easy Bake oven for Victor

1937
03:45:11,620 --> 03:45:13,620
on the food match.

1938
03:45:13,620 --> 03:45:15,819
That's the end of that one.

1939
03:45:15,819 --> 03:45:17,819
McRiddler and Long Chicken Sandwich.

1940
03:45:17,819 --> 03:45:22,360
That could have gone either way.

1941
03:45:22,360 --> 03:45:24,239
Either way.

1942
03:45:24,239 --> 03:45:33,719
Congratulations to the McRiddler and Long Chicken Sandwich.

1943
03:45:33,719 --> 03:45:36,110
Nice work.

1944
03:45:36,110 --> 03:45:39,780
Fan favorites.

1945
03:45:39,780 --> 03:45:42,430
Scripted.

1946
03:45:42,430 --> 03:45:43,430
What do you mean scripted?

1947
03:45:43,430 --> 03:45:44,430
I didn't script any of this.

1948
03:45:44,430 --> 03:45:45,430
It's all random.

1949
03:45:45,430 --> 03:45:50,319
Okay.

1950
03:45:50,319 --> 03:45:57,819
It's now time to get to the big categories, the meaty ones, the real meaty ones.

1951
03:45:57,819 --> 03:46:00,209
Going up next.

1952
03:46:00,209 --> 03:46:04,409
We've got a long way to go, but we're going to push forward.

1953
03:46:10,579 --> 03:46:14,200
Best Scare Moment of the Year, which is...

1954
03:46:14,200 --> 03:46:15,569
You can probably guess.

1955
03:46:15,569 --> 03:46:17,569
Ummmm...

1956
03:46:17,569 --> 03:46:18,569
Scary Moments.

1957
03:46:18,569 --> 03:46:20,959
VR.

1958
03:46:20,959 --> 03:46:22,139
Non-VR.

1959
03:46:22,139 --> 03:46:23,139
Horror Games.

1960
03:46:23,139 --> 03:46:24,139
Scared.

1961
03:46:24,139 --> 03:46:25,639
I get scared.

1962
03:46:25,639 --> 03:46:26,639
My voice is junk.

1963
03:46:26,639 --> 03:46:28,000
Hold on.

1964
03:46:28,000 --> 03:46:34,680
God, I talked for three hours.

1965
03:46:34,680 --> 03:46:35,680
My voice is junk.

1966
03:46:35,680 --> 03:46:37,629
What the fuck?

1967
03:46:37,629 --> 03:46:41,829
This is the nominees for Best Scare Moment of the Year.

1968
03:46:41,829 --> 03:46:42,829
Wait, did I not mute?

1969
03:46:42,829 --> 03:46:48,610
I muted, right?

1970
03:46:48,610 --> 03:46:49,610
I hope I did.

1971
03:46:49,610 --> 03:46:52,000
Okay.

1972
03:46:52,000 --> 03:46:53,950
Thank God.

1973
03:46:53,950 --> 03:46:57,319
Here are your nominees for Best Scare Moment of the Year.

1974
03:46:57,319 --> 03:46:58,319
Horror Games.

1975
03:46:58,319 --> 03:46:59,319
Jumpscares.

1976
03:47:00,680 --> 03:47:08,319
Did I do it?

1977
03:47:08,319 --> 03:47:09,559
Nobody picked me up.

1978
03:47:09,559 --> 03:47:14,120
I'm like a microphone in an office complex being like, the job is done.

1979
03:47:14,120 --> 03:47:15,120
I just blew it.

1980
03:47:15,120 --> 03:47:17,450
I got too close.

1981
03:47:17,450 --> 03:47:20,610
I was talking.

1982
03:47:25,629 --> 03:47:27,829
Alright.

1983
03:47:28,829 --> 03:47:31,090
Let go!

1984
03:47:31,090 --> 03:47:33,549
Oh, I was holding on to it.

1985
03:47:33,549 --> 03:47:34,549
Let's get this shit out of me.

1986
03:47:34,549 --> 03:47:36,549
I didn't let it go.

1987
03:47:36,549 --> 03:47:37,549
Easy.

1988
03:47:37,549 --> 03:47:38,549
Don't let me get the spray can.

1989
03:47:38,549 --> 03:47:40,549
Don't let me get the fucking spray can.

1990
03:47:40,549 --> 03:47:42,549
If everyone wants to talk shit...

1991
03:47:43,549 --> 03:47:44,920
Stop it!

1992
03:47:44,920 --> 03:47:46,920
What the fuck is he doing?

1993
03:47:46,920 --> 03:47:53,700
That's to get the shit out of me.

1994
03:47:53,700 --> 03:47:54,700
And I did it.

1995
03:47:55,700 --> 03:48:02,639
What the fuck was that?

1996
03:48:02,639 --> 03:48:03,639
I still...

1997
03:48:03,639 --> 03:48:05,639
I don't know if this is addictive.

1998
03:48:05,639 --> 03:48:06,639
It could be addictive.

1999
03:48:06,639 --> 03:48:07,639
Did he just launch those back at me?

2000
03:48:07,639 --> 03:48:08,639
I don't know.

2001
03:48:08,639 --> 03:48:09,639
Holy shit.

2002
03:48:09,639 --> 03:48:10,639
How are you doing that?

2003
03:48:10,639 --> 03:48:11,639
Where'd he go?

2004
03:48:21,409 --> 03:48:22,409
Why are you alive?

2005
03:48:52,860 --> 03:48:54,159
Ooh, we can break that.

2006
03:48:56,750 --> 03:48:57,750
You're almost boring.

2007
03:48:57,750 --> 03:48:58,750
Let me just see if I...

2008
03:48:59,750 --> 03:49:01,440
I lost!

2009
03:49:05,440 --> 03:49:06,440
Oh!

2010
03:49:10,280 --> 03:49:11,280
Are we alright?

2011
03:49:11,280 --> 03:49:12,280
It's stuck on me!

2012
03:49:12,280 --> 03:49:13,280
Get it off me!

2013
03:49:13,280 --> 03:49:14,280
Get it off me!

2014
03:49:14,280 --> 03:49:15,280
Get it off me!

2015
03:49:15,280 --> 03:49:16,280
It's stuck on me!

2016
03:49:16,280 --> 03:49:17,280
Oh, no.

2017
03:49:17,280 --> 03:49:18,280
It's alright.

2018
03:49:18,280 --> 03:49:19,280
Is it open?

2019
03:49:19,280 --> 03:49:20,280
Now it is.

2020
03:49:20,280 --> 03:49:21,719
Look out the window.

2021
03:49:21,719 --> 03:49:23,020
04.

2022
03:49:53,959 --> 03:49:56,229
What happened?

2023
03:49:56,229 --> 03:49:58,159
I didn't pull the pin.

2024
03:49:58,159 --> 03:49:59,159
I didn't pull the pin.

2025
03:49:59,159 --> 03:50:00,780
Did I?

2026
03:50:00,780 --> 03:50:01,780
When did I pull the pin?

2027
03:50:06,090 --> 03:50:07,090
I didn't pull the pin.

2028
03:50:08,090 --> 03:50:09,090
What happened?

2029
03:50:09,090 --> 03:50:10,090
Look.

2030
03:50:10,090 --> 03:50:11,090
I was just holding it in my hand.

2031
03:50:11,090 --> 03:50:12,090
Did the pin come out?

2032
03:50:12,090 --> 03:50:13,090
No, it didn't.

2033
03:50:13,090 --> 03:50:16,799
What the fuck is happening, dude?

2034
03:50:16,799 --> 03:50:19,129
Oh my god!

2035
03:50:19,129 --> 03:50:20,129
It's not even opening!

2036
03:50:24,700 --> 03:50:25,700
I hate this shit.

2037
03:50:25,700 --> 03:50:26,700
I hated this.

2038
03:50:26,700 --> 03:50:27,700
Mama!

2039
03:50:27,700 --> 03:50:28,700
Yeah, I agree.

2040
03:50:28,700 --> 03:50:29,700
Mama!

2041
03:50:31,899 --> 03:50:32,899
He got me!

2042
03:50:32,899 --> 03:50:33,899
Oh my god!

2043
03:50:33,899 --> 03:50:41,979
That baby...

2044
03:50:41,979 --> 03:50:42,979
This shit's so fucked up.

2045
03:50:42,979 --> 03:50:46,170
That was a good game, though.

2046
03:50:46,170 --> 03:50:47,170
Big fan.

2047
03:50:47,170 --> 03:50:57,780
Alright, your winner for best scare of the year is...

2048
03:50:57,780 --> 03:51:00,340
I haven't broken the seal.

2049
03:51:00,340 --> 03:51:05,290
Oops.

2050
03:51:05,290 --> 03:51:06,290
Ooh, close.

2051
03:51:06,290 --> 03:51:07,290
Very close.

2052
03:51:07,290 --> 03:51:08,659
Why?

2053
03:51:08,659 --> 03:51:10,959
Why was this one of the most skipped?

2054
03:51:10,959 --> 03:51:15,100
This is the second most skipped category the whole year.

2055
03:51:15,100 --> 03:51:16,659
Why?

2056
03:51:16,659 --> 03:51:27,930
Monster Baby Eats Germa at 15%, Accidental Zerk Escape at 14%, and Cat Twerk Glitch at

2057
03:51:27,930 --> 03:51:30,190
13%.

2058
03:51:30,190 --> 03:51:31,190
Second most skipped.

2059
03:51:31,190 --> 03:51:32,190
Why?

2060
03:51:32,190 --> 03:51:33,190
Too scary?

2061
03:51:33,190 --> 03:51:39,809
Why?

2062
03:51:39,809 --> 03:51:40,809
Because it's scary.

2063
03:51:40,809 --> 03:51:42,559
Okay, whatever.

2064
03:51:42,559 --> 03:51:45,700
Monster Baby Eats Germa.

2065
03:51:45,700 --> 03:51:46,700
That game is so fucked up.

2066
03:51:46,700 --> 03:51:50,700
That part in particular, oh my god, that messed me up.

2067
03:51:50,700 --> 03:51:54,260
I hated that part.

2068
03:51:54,260 --> 03:51:56,260
Not even a big deal, but my god.

2069
03:51:56,260 --> 03:52:01,020
I felt so awful playing through that part.

2070
03:52:01,020 --> 03:52:06,100
Alright, meaty category number five.

2071
03:52:06,100 --> 03:52:07,100
We've got best singing.

2072
03:52:07,100 --> 03:52:10,860
There's best and worst singing, by the way.

2073
03:52:10,860 --> 03:52:14,309
So these are back to back, so get ready.

2074
03:52:14,309 --> 03:52:16,309
Kind of like best noise, worst noise.

2075
03:52:16,309 --> 03:52:17,309
They could be...

2076
03:52:17,309 --> 03:52:19,309
You look like John from Garfield.

2077
03:52:19,309 --> 03:52:20,309
You know what?

2078
03:52:20,309 --> 03:52:21,309
Fuck off, okay?

2079
03:52:21,309 --> 03:52:23,309
I'm getting this off.

2080
03:52:23,309 --> 03:52:27,059
I'm not John from Garfield, for god's sakes.

2081
03:52:27,059 --> 03:52:28,059
Get it off.

2082
03:52:28,059 --> 03:52:29,430
Get it off me.

2083
03:52:29,430 --> 03:52:33,850
Get it off.

2084
03:52:33,850 --> 03:52:35,850
I don't want it on anymore.

2085
03:52:35,850 --> 03:52:45,770
Sometimes I sing.

2086
03:52:45,770 --> 03:52:49,139
You've heard me sing maybe once or twice on this stream already.

2087
03:52:49,139 --> 03:52:52,139
Here are your nominees for the best time that I've...

2088
03:52:52,139 --> 03:52:53,139
Oh, god damn it.

2089
03:52:53,139 --> 03:53:11,420
Fucking god damn John Arbuckle.

2090
03:53:11,420 --> 03:53:12,420
Fuck!

2091
03:53:12,420 --> 03:53:13,420
No!

2092
03:53:13,420 --> 03:53:25,000
It is!

2093
03:53:25,000 --> 03:53:27,579
Fuck!

2094
03:53:27,579 --> 03:53:28,579
No!

2095
03:53:28,579 --> 03:53:29,579
It can't be!

2096
03:53:29,579 --> 03:53:32,100
It is.

2097
03:53:32,100 --> 03:53:33,100
I'll stand up.

2098
03:53:33,100 --> 03:53:34,100
Fine.

2099
03:53:34,100 --> 03:53:35,100
Fuck it.

2100
03:53:35,100 --> 03:53:48,629
Whatever.

2101
03:53:48,629 --> 03:53:49,629
Who cares?

2102
03:53:49,629 --> 03:53:50,629
God damn it!

2103
03:53:50,629 --> 03:53:51,629
I fucking quit.

2104
03:53:51,629 --> 03:53:53,629
I quit streaming.

2105
03:53:53,629 --> 03:53:54,629
Best...

2106
03:53:54,629 --> 03:53:57,629
Here's the nominees for best singing of the year.

2107
03:53:57,629 --> 03:53:58,629
Best singing of the year.

2108
03:53:58,629 --> 03:53:59,629
Here we go.

2109
03:53:59,629 --> 03:54:11,620
Caves, caves.

2110
03:54:11,620 --> 03:54:12,620
How about Minecraft Steve?

2111
03:54:12,620 --> 03:54:13,620
Alright, quiet.

2112
03:54:13,620 --> 03:54:14,620
Caves.

2113
03:54:14,620 --> 03:54:15,620
Caves.

2114
03:54:15,620 --> 03:54:16,620
Caves.

2115
03:54:16,620 --> 03:54:17,620
Caves.

2116
03:54:17,620 --> 03:54:21,500
Sure, but you can find it in that cave.

2117
03:54:21,500 --> 03:54:22,500
Cave.

2118
03:54:22,500 --> 03:54:23,500
Cave.

2119
03:54:23,500 --> 03:54:24,500
Cave.

2120
03:54:24,500 --> 03:54:25,739
Cave.

2121
03:54:25,739 --> 03:54:26,739
Where can I get it?

2122
03:54:26,739 --> 03:54:30,739
I'm going to warm myself up to be Mario because I'm a huge fan.

2123
03:54:30,739 --> 03:54:33,920

clown lady we got both clowns here by the way clown too that's right i mean couldn't be anybody

2312
04:28:46,069 --> 04:28:56,569

2313
04:28:56,569 --> 04:29:04,299
goes right for death the two clowns might have the advantage by the way because they're both working

2314
04:29:04,299 --> 04:29:13,260
together eight people in the ring absolute carnage is unfolding edna going for the pin on death

2315
04:29:13,260 --> 04:29:24,149
immediately not even spending one second as we got action outside the ring not even focused

2316
04:29:24,149 --> 04:29:30,860

2317
04:29:30,860 --> 04:29:41,979
way zero weapons count furniture counts false count anywhere it's going to be hard to pay

2318
04:29:41,979 --> 04:29:52,459
attention to what's going on on the screen as uncle ted is already dead for the third time

2319
04:29:52,860 --> 04:30:06,729
good luck paying attention to any of this balls count anywhere edna and clown lady outside was

2472
05:06:35,209 --> 05:06:39,430
is one of us in 10 speak now i'm about to grip it

2473
05:06:42,069 --> 05:07:07,299
ah some pretty bad ones this year uh the worst in particular though by a lot this was not even

2474
05:07:07,299 --> 05:07:23,610
close which is really surprising your worst meltdown of the entire year is warrior wear

2475
05:07:23,610 --> 05:07:32,580
warrior wear with 38 percent of the vote swept it destroyed everybody else nick tunes baseball

2476
05:07:32,580 --> 05:07:42,549
and the capcom rant we're at two and three 38 22 and 13 respectively warrior where i took it

2477
05:07:42,549 --> 05:07:52,250
i mean i i i was melting my brain during that stream all right the next one is pretty special

2478
05:07:52,250 --> 05:07:58,700
to me because obviously um it's not best stream of the year it's not worst stream of the year

2479
05:07:58,700 --> 05:08:06,790
it's best dollhouse moment of the year um every time i see clips of this show and clips of people

2480
05:08:06,790 --> 05:08:12,389
hey that was fun that was a cool the dollhouse thing um this could have won probably every

2481
05:08:12,389 --> 05:08:18,889
category it could have won best joke best stream best meltdown like i didn't want to have it

2482
05:08:18,889 --> 05:08:26,020
nominated for every single category but it has a huge place in my heart as some of the most fun i

2483
05:08:26,020 --> 05:08:32,759
probably ever had in my life so watching you know the music play and different characters come on

2484
05:08:32,759 --> 05:08:38,759
screen and stuff it was uh it's really fun to watch because i have not really seen it i don't

2485
05:08:38,759 --> 05:08:45,340
really um i don't watch a whole lot of the stuff that i do really so seeing like random clips

2486
05:08:45,340 --> 05:08:51,740
every now and then is like oh yeah that was like that was a lot of fun uh so this one is like kind

2487
05:08:51,740 --> 05:08:58,090
of special because this gets its own category it does not get it would have swept every other

2488
05:08:58,090 --> 05:09:07,259
category so we made it its own category um it's it's got a special place here right here so this

2489
05:09:07,259 --> 05:09:28,389
is the best dollhouse moment from the dollhouse streams and here we go i'm very curious what's

2490
05:09:28,389 --> 05:09:32,869
the what scene oh so would you like to spend an evening together is what i'm asking

2491

2622
05:32:47,020 --> 05:32:53,689
to those people that i did last year and that's i don't really try to do anything else here besides

2625
05:33:15,939 --> 05:33:27,380
want to do so let's find out what was the best stream of last year or this year right what do

2626
05:33:27,380 --> 05:33:40,580
you think besides dollhouse ladies and gentlemen the winner it was close closer than i thought

2627
05:33:40,580 --> 05:33:51,939
because one of them was a big event with 25 percent of the vote the archaeology stream is

2628
05:33:51,939 --> 05:34:02,500
your winner right behind it at 22 percent was wrestling empire that was very close

2629
05:34:02,500 --> 05:34:10,759
eugleberry's cauldron was underneath that at 10 but the archaeology stream takes it

2630
05:34:10,759 --> 05:34:18,200
besides dollhouse obviously right but i still can't fucking believe i'm sitting here right now

2631

2633
05:34:41,930 --> 05:34:46,330

05:42:58,950 --> 05:43:08,020
with lady denitra sue tag team win here trying to come in and stake his victory stake his claim to

2686
05:43:08,020 --> 05:43:19,400
the germa 985 rumble throne potentially oh amelia out eliminated with a big punch by silly silly

2687
05:43:19,400 --> 05:43:25,939
wonka that did not take very much time at all as chris redfield grabs bf bugleberry belly to belly

2688
05:43:25,939 --> 05:43:35,560
suplex our next contestant coming in now is armin from attack on titan erin erin the last time you

2689
05:43:35,560 --> 05:43:46,279
hear that ever as silly silly wonka going over the top ropes by catboy and the horror bugleberry

2690
05:43:46,279 --> 05:43:55,369
still safe are still safe although maybe not for long as chris redfield trying to dump him over

2691
05:43:55,369 --> 05:44:04,779
the top ropes very strong character is chris banana redfield but catboy now they're double

2692
05:44:04,779 --> 05:44:11,159
teaming bf bugleberry together trying to eliminate him and will they get it no they will not

2693
05:44:12,119 --> 05:44:21,740
and here comes jex fan favorite rumble favorite number 10 jex is in the building ready to cause

2694
05:44:21,740 --> 05:44:27,740
havoc and mayhem and show his gamer skills by potentially dumping bugleberry not over the top

2695
05:44:27,740 --> 05:44:35,930
ropes simply smushing his neck and there goes the horror chris redfield eliminated the horror

2696
05:44:37,139 --> 05:44:46,819
with a big right hand and taunting in the middle of the ring as jex is recovering just barely

2697
05:44:46,819 --> 05:44:52,310
getting in the ring and here comes joel from vinesauce was supposed to be in the rumble last

2698
05:44:52,310 --> 05:45:01,819
year but i fucked it up so here comes joel for the first time ever from vine wrestle and there

2699
05:45:01,819 --> 05:45:12,340
goes bugleberry bugleberry is out eliminated first contestant it sucks it's too bad there goes hot

2700
05:45:12,340 --> 05:45:27,770
tub bugleberry almost at number 12 i think 11 armin still in the ring and representing the grotto

2701
05:45:27,770 --> 05:45:38,409
beasts introducing miaudi still where is miaudi why is miaudi not in the ring okay

2702
05:45:38,409 --> 05:45:47,029
it took you a little longer representing grotto beasts is miaudi if miaudi eliminates jex they're

2703
05:45:47,029 --> 05:45:58,220
the favorite jex is 100 stats let's be very clear about this big suplex from armin on joel

2704
05:45:59,099 --> 05:46:08,009
as miaudi can i don't know what now he's doing i would say top seed three cat people are in the

2705
05:46:08,009 --> 05:46:12,979
ring right now homer simpson all of you were looking for homer you finally got your homer

2706
05:46:12,979 --> 05:46:24,220
simpson was not going to put homer in a match but there they are picking up joel and doing a suplex

2707
05:46:24,220 --> 05:46:31,340
to joel swinging belly to back suplex but chris redfield now i i kind of have high hopes for chris

2708
05:46:31,340 --> 05:46:40,279
redfield i say that until oh please don't do it homer homer simpson now is threatening to

2709
05:46:40,279 --> 05:46:47,270
throw chris redfield over the top ropes looks like they might get it and here comes tier list

2710
05:46:47,270 --> 05:46:58,810
andy oh shit he actually did it no uh tier list andy is just a tier list as homer simpson just

2711
05:46:58,810 --> 05:47:07,130
absolutely decimates crisp banana redfield really sad stuff that we're seeing here what tier list

2712
05:47:07,130 --> 05:47:14,970
is on tier list andy i don't know it's hard to tell i don't know what what is on his back

2713
05:47:16,520 --> 05:47:24,200
as miaudi eliminates cat boy germa cat eliminates cat who could see that coming from a while away i

2714
05:47:24,200 --> 05:47:33,240
don't know cat boy gone miaudi eliminates cat boy when i told you top seed i meant it i was not

2715
05:47:33,240 --> 05:47:45,130
messing around i really meant it as homer simpson now in the corner jex gets a get gets armin armin

2716
05:47:45,529 --> 05:47:49,529
i think from the last match really kind of got annoyed at me talking about how shitty he was

2717
05:47:50,330 --> 05:47:59,430
and how not strong that armin was trying to go for jex which is a huge mistake you don't go for

2718
05:47:59,430 --> 05:48:06,389
jex in quotes that's how you die as miaudi and homer simpson with tier list andy in the mix as

2719
05:48:06,389 --> 05:48:13,529
well joel from vinesauce also is there still fighting for his life against tier list andy

2720
05:48:14,009 --> 05:48:20,200
if homer simpson wins the rumble i will eat glass on stream make that clear

2721
05:48:22,060 --> 05:48:38,419
it's the fucking way as miaudi now is over on the right side who's the next competitor it's mr

2722
05:48:38,419 --> 05:48:47,099
green or mr greens and depending on who you are you can say it however you want here's mr greens

2723
05:48:47,099 --> 05:48:52,919
he's in the last rumble making his second or third appearance in the germa rumble here going right

2724
05:48:52,919 --> 05:48:59,099
for armin armin now over the top ropes might oh there goes jex miaudi's top seed i would be

2725
05:48:59,099 --> 05:49:04,299
terrified of miaudi right now homer simpson and mr green trying to get armin out we will never

2726
05:49:04,299 --> 05:49:12,310
hear erin again hopefully thank god we'll never hear it again armin has been eliminated by homer

2727
05:49:12,310 --> 05:49:20,540
simpson and mr green as josh from science center nevada science josh making his first appearance

2728
05:49:20,540 --> 05:49:28,700
in the germa rumble there he is the archaeologist geologist whatever i'm sorry science center josh

2729
05:49:28,700 --> 05:49:37,430
making his appearance as armin is really slowly getting up here hopefully not injured just to go

2730
05:49:37,430 --> 05:49:45,720
homer missed completely science center nevada josh just powerbomb joel outside the ring there goes joel

2731
05:49:47,669 --> 05:49:56,549
joel has been eliminated from the germa rumble sorry joel it's been a pleasure to have you but

2732
05:49:56,549 --> 05:50:03,500

someone get rid of it miaudi will take care of it i'm certain of it miaudi is going to be fine

2734
05:50:14,229 --> 05:50:19,750
science josh is on the ropes here homer simpson now but tier list andy miaudi looking for their

2735
05:50:19,750 --> 05:50:27,590
i think fifth or sixth elimination no don't powerbomb josh out oh fuck homer simpson powerbomb

2736
05:50:27,590 --> 05:50:32,549
science center josh outside the ring but torgo making their appearance coming in hot

2737
05:50:35,430 --> 05:50:45,849
here comes torgo high hopes for torgo from mano's hands of fate mr green now looking at

2738
05:50:45,849 --> 05:50:53,159
homer simpson trying to get him out of here i hope we see it please get rid of homer

2739
05:50:53,880 --> 05:51:03,110
homer cannot win it can't happen where's the music somebody just grab the ropes and dump him over

2740
05:51:03,189 --> 05:51:13,689
oh my god the mcgriddler at number 18 coming in saw the mcgriddler earlier but i would love to see

2741
05:51:13,689 --> 05:51:20,659
a few eliminations from the from the mcgriddler now in trouble with the tier list now

2742
05:51:22,970 --> 05:51:35,000
is it possible we could see a miaudi elimination no not yet as torgo now has homer get rid of homer

2743
05:51:35,000 --> 05:51:44,150
now use that fucked up cane that you have no what oh my goodness the sus guy coming in but

2746
05:52:10,650 --> 05:52:16,139
sorry miaudi that's that's very unfortunate i would have liked to see miaudi go all the way

2747
05:52:16,139 --> 05:52:27,340
at least the top five here comes germadillo a bttv emote i'm probably we'll probably see it a few

2748
05:52:31,500 --> 05:52:37,240

2752
05:53:07,130 --> 05:53:20,009
and tier list andy both gone getting down to the final i believe 12 competitors in this rumble

homer simpson still in it torgo now and germadillo please mcridler get rid of him

2754
05:53:34,680 --> 05:53:41,979
do not let homer simpson win let's see a double elimination it's possible although i don't know

2755
05:53:41,979 --> 05:53:49,830
how probable there goes no he saved it still held on william carslough i'm sure a bunch of

2756
05:53:49,830 --> 05:53:54,549
people probably saying who right now that's fine because that's the battleship captain from the

2757
05:53:54,549 --> 05:54:08,380
battleship meta that is the battleship captain he's got a name you know going right for the

2758
05:54:08,380 --> 05:54:14,580
mcridler the failed meta that meta was fine for like a week it was like two or three weeks give

2759
05:54:14,580 --> 05:54:25,770
me a break this is a real guy i is it a real guy i don't know number 22 coming in dollhouse germa

2760
05:54:37,430 --> 05:54:48,220
please get rid of homer simpson as the mcridler gets him in the top he's on the turnbuckle this

2761
05:54:48,220 --> 05:54:56,630
is really bad spot to be for homer help him go help him william carslough whatever your goddamn

2762
05:54:56,630 --> 05:55:06,020
name is real historical landing oh my god wait no like it's spampton from delta rune chapter two

2763
05:55:06,020 --> 05:55:13,799
spampton is joining the rumble for the first time ever i thought he threw out immediately

2764
05:55:18,889 --> 05:55:28,040
spampton welcome everybody spampton homer simpson is still in this rumble as william carslough

2765
05:55:28,040 --> 05:55:33,560
really trying to just trying to find out is he c3 is he d5 i doesn't know where homer's battleship

2766
05:55:33,799 --> 05:55:38,360
he's really trying to find it didn't find it unfortunately here comes fish bastard

2767
05:55:38,360 --> 05:55:49,270
at number 24 from the hot tub stream one of bugleberry's many disgusting absurd

2768
05:55:49,270 --> 05:55:55,689
horrific creations of all the things it looks like the mcridler is gonna have to deal with

2769
05:55:55,689 --> 05:56:05,560
the fish bastard one-on-one here will the fish bastard take out the mcridler with the help of

2770
05:56:05,560 --> 05:56:10,119
spampton they really went this is potentially a newfound alliance we're seeing here

2771
05:56:13,830 --> 05:56:19,770
warner von brawn is the oh oh oh oh guy there goes torgo by homer simpson

2772
05:56:23,799 --> 05:56:31,029
oh oh makes up number 24 second simpson's character that's right so if there's somebody

2773
05:56:31,029 --> 05:56:39,049
to eliminate homer simpson it's definitely him torgo i don't think you'll be in the next rumble

2774
05:56:39,049 --> 05:56:48,020
but it was really nice to have you thanks for coming spampton fish bastard mcridler and

2775
05:56:48,020 --> 05:56:56,470
warner von brawn no just barely hangs on is the mcridler while dollhouse germa is still fighting

2776
05:56:56,470 --> 05:57:02,150
the battleship captain which is strange because i mean that's his meta he created that meta that's

2777
05:57:02,150 --> 05:57:08,040
just like that's his meta it's weird that he'd be fighting against that meta i mean you could argue

2778
05:57:08,040 --> 05:57:13,000
that like ludwig and others made that meta happen because germa's an irrelevant andy

2779
05:57:13,000 --> 05:57:17,560
and really didn't have much pull at all but just decided to ask in a relevant brain he's gone

2780
05:57:17,560 --> 05:57:35,450
germa's gone fuck him who cares who gives a shit about that guy well there goes dollhouse germa

2781
05:57:36,090 --> 05:57:47,060
i don't think germa's ever going to win a competition why would he big big what's that

2782
05:57:47,060 --> 05:57:52,180
called the gold gold rush i don't know whatever the guy's name is goldman what's the guy's name

2783
05:57:52,180 --> 05:57:59,159
goldberg big goldberg jackhammer on homer simpson has the battleship captain really

2784
05:57:59,159 --> 05:58:04,040
taken it to homer simpson now here this would be a real big relief for me there he goes

2785
05:58:04,599 --> 05:58:10,360
goodbye homer simpson goodbye spampton battleship captain and eliminate finally homer simpson

2786
05:58:12,840 --> 05:58:25,450
thank god here comes anubis from smite getting us to 26 characters i saw anubis earlier in the

2788
05:58:40,500 --> 05:58:47,299

2789
05:58:48,389 --> 05:58:54,549
i'm not happy about what i just saw that's sad i was rooting for the mick redler the whole time

2790
05:58:57,619 --> 05:59:05,270
still four contestants that have yet to come out it's all random by the way i have no control

2791
05:59:05,270 --> 05:59:12,919
over any of the things you're seeing on screen i just put them into the rumble fish bastard down

no just going for a taunt stupid move hockey um um will you put him down it's his year well

2793
05:59:29,540 --> 05:59:34,900
it very well could be considering that glue man is number 27 in the rumble 2021

2794
05:59:36,040 --> 05:59:43,819
great opportunity for glue man is it glue man's year this year will we see a glue man victory for

2795
05:59:43,819 --> 05:59:55,849
the first time in almost seven years that's to be determined i don't want to get my hopes up

2796
05:59:56,569 --> 06:00:06,200
but this could be glue man's year 27 welcome back glue man for the seventh or eighth annual time

here we go mr satan glue man battleship captain fish bastard cromwell the praying mantis guardian

2831
06:07:42,700 --> 06:07:49,159
and the lala dog looks like we might see an immediate elimination in this final five

2832
06:07:49,959 --> 06:07:56,840
there goes cromwell for this be the year of the glue man i've been doing this every year

2833
06:07:56,840 --> 06:08:01,099
since like 2012 and glue man has been there since the very beginning

2834
06:08:03,380 --> 06:08:17,430
will we actually get a glue man germa rumble victory i don't know but we're down to the final

2835
06:08:17,430 --> 06:08:24,310
five blue man picking up the lala dog looks like lala could see the end here

2836
06:08:25,270 --> 06:08:33,400
yeah all right final four no fish bastard has glue man up on the ropes

2837
06:08:34,979 --> 06:08:43,110
this is glue man's year it can't be oh fish bastard like the worst character made in the cauldron

2838
06:08:43,110 --> 06:08:50,810
you can't eliminate glue man thank goodness the battleship captain has glue man now we have to see

2839
06:08:50,810 --> 06:09:02,950
a momentum change here or this is a huge problem mr satan fish bastard glue man's gotta get every

2840
06:09:02,950 --> 06:09:11,029
need to give glue man our strength there goes fish bastard down to the final three mr satan

2841
06:09:11,029 --> 06:09:20,150
battleship captain and glue man i have no idea what's gonna happen but i have an outcome that

2842
06:09:20,150 --> 06:09:26,520
i want i don't know if it's outcome we're gonna get as mr satan grabs glue man now by the wrist

2843
06:09:28,020 --> 06:09:40,250
big reversal by glue man no no you gotta reverse these glue man there it is big reversal

2844
06:09:43,779 --> 06:09:47,939
gets clothesline for his effort so much energy so much effort from glue man

2845
06:09:51,819 --> 06:09:55,500
slow to get up though which is bad which means the fatigue is really high

2846
06:09:56,220 --> 06:10:06,680
as mr satan goes into the ropes battleship captain holy shit mr satan no double reversal here

2847
06:10:08,630 --> 06:10:18,459
a triple reversal they're gonna double team and get him over the ropes mr satan is about

2848
06:10:18,459 --> 06:10:27,779
to eliminate the battleship captain as glue man watches on no still gaining some strength it seems

2849
06:10:29,860 --> 06:10:40,470
big russian sweet whatever that's called oh no mr satan with the big double arm tiger suplex

2850
06:10:41,750 --> 06:10:46,389
you gotta be shitting me glue man gonna go for a throw mr satan over the top ropes

2851
06:10:47,189 --> 06:10:59,110
he's hungry this year he's starving for it no it's not gonna be enough he gets reversed

2852
06:11:02,360 --> 06:11:12,169
don't be an idiot glue man no he's getting too cocky oh shit you've been here for seven straight

2853
06:11:12,169 --> 06:11:20,939
years glue man you can't just be cocky and go taunt mr satan big reversal though elbow to the

2854
06:11:20,939 --> 06:11:27,459
face of mr satan i'm actually kind of nervous for glue man right now this is kind of bad

2855
06:11:33,669 --> 06:11:42,139
two belly-to-belly suplexes mr satan is stacked cleaning up the ring right now

2856
06:11:42,700 --> 06:11:53,259
i'm surprised the battleship captain has lasted this long one of these three will be crowned

2857
06:11:53,259 --> 06:12:06,380
champion of the rumble and we all know who we want it to be go for it glue man stop being cocky go

2858
06:12:06,380 --> 06:12:13,700
for it cool you know i think the problem is he's never had this much screen time before

2859
06:12:14,659 --> 06:12:25,689
he's milking the audience and it's going to be his downfall this is the most screen time he's

2860
06:12:25,689 --> 06:12:37,430
ever had he's hoping to get a book deal after this is over big belly to back suplex will the

2861
06:12:37,430 --> 06:12:55,509
cockiness oh god it's over he's gone glue man has been eliminated see you later that's very sad

2862
06:12:58,090 --> 06:13:05,590
battleship captain and mr satan are the final two competitors this year better luck next year

2863
06:13:05,590 --> 06:13:12,869
yeah unfortunate the hubris i know what was he doing he's like taunting he's going on the

2864
06:13:12,869 --> 06:13:23,560
top ropes like get down man what's wrong with you rip rip rip yeah sad you hate to see it

2865
06:13:24,200 --> 06:13:36,099
it looks like mr satan is going no he's not this would be quite an upset if william carslark the

2866
06:13:36,099 --> 06:14:01,080
battleship captain wins the game what an upset uh i need to take it that was so i didn't think

2867
06:14:01,080 --> 06:14:13,959
he's gonna do it that quickly he is the strongest man on earth so it makes sense right

2868
06:14:23,159 --> 06:14:26,439
i am the strongest man on earth i'm the strongest man a wrestler

2869
