20
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:18,620
thanks for the reminder I've been looking forward to this game I wanted to play it since they

21
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:24,310
announced it I was a big fan of the first one and I hated the first one I was a huge fan of the

22
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,520
second one and I hated the second one I think that's just how it is when you're a no more

23
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:35,259
heroes fan you love these games so much but you also don't like them at all it's a really

24
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:45,080
weird way to go about it this series is one of my favorite actual series but I hate these games

25
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:54,069
it's weird he's gonna hate this one I'm just fucking around everybody come on

26
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:59,539
but you'd have been here before actually some of you may not have been here before

27
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:04,500
now but I like the games are always really fun but they're a little they're a little grungy

28
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:11,210
that makes any sense I'm fully expecting that no I didn't play Travis Strikes again because

29
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:18,139
I don't know it's like three times as long as all the no more heroes main games and it's a

30
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:24,649
top-down game I want to like slash around the sword and jump around and don't be paper don't

31
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:32,439
let paper Mario thousand year door be a wicked lie it's not a lie it just it was reality if I'm

32
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:36,600
going to stream like twice a week somewhere between one and two times a week on the weekends

33
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:42,360
I can't like thousand year door is like a thousand year long game it's a thousand hours

34
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,339
I don't think I could do it it would take me I would take forever

35
00:04:49,220 --> 00:05:02,199
all right I'm ready I'm ready to go I think thousand year game yeah

36
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:06,629
thought you were streaming on Friday I figured we would just go back to the weekends like we

37
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:16,019
were supposed to so from here on out you are to expect a Saturday Sunday experience maybe Friday

38
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:23,899
Saturday Friday Saturday Saturday only Saturday Sunday I think it's a it's a good place to be

39
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:30,389
and I wanted to kind of get back to that schedule so this is going to be

40
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:35,209
uh we'll do Saturday Sunday because this game's obviously not just going to be one and done

41
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:38,329
because I have to I'm playing through the game because I fucking love this game I love this

42
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:44,459
series I hate this series so you know we have to do it uh this one actually is I think it's

43
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:51,540
supposed to be a little longer than the uh than the other two so we'll see like a bug just no

44
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:07,459
let's bring it over all right I'm ready how come there's no audio can you guys hear anything bad

45
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:14,259
controllers here we come I am playing with the joy cons and I know that that's I I don't like

46
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:20,019
these things but it says for the best experience use the joy cons and I just got 10 community subs

47
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:25,319
from James Morris thank you appreciate it but I also want to play the regular difficulty not

48
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:31,379
the hard one I'm not going to play this mode this is just like the cutscene mode I'm going to play

49
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:41,079
bitter formidable foes normal recommended difficulty hey Taylor uh thanks for those 10

50
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:47,620
community subs you didn't play Travis strikes again you aren't going to understand anything

51
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:57,589
no I don't I look they're gonna they're going to do the thing that they do in all these games if

52
00:06:57,589 --> 00:07:03,990
you there's a one gigantic side game in the middle they're gonna do a previously on the next game of

53
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,980
thrones cutscene that happens before I start the game we're gonna get caught up in the first cut

54
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:16,379
scene that's how they do it because then I don't have to play the game and would you look at that

55
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:22,889
we've got another 10 give me to do subs from uh Vince smoke thank you I've not been calling out

56
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:26,860
any of the big community subs recently because I really haven't been able to look

57
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:33,959
all right here you go ready previously on no more heroes I'm starting I'm ready I'm gonna milk this

58
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:43,050
because I've been waiting for this game for like three years you hear anything there's no sound

59
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:48,870
once the difficulty level has been set it cannot be changed later during the game are you sure

60
00:07:48,870 --> 00:08:08,040
I'm sure there's an audio oh there is oh suda 51 loves his like retro I'm looking forward to the

61
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:23,480
minigames are there any minigames in this one press any button death hand death claw was it

62
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:34,019
stage one I remembered this game I used to play nobody at school had it but I was super into it

63
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:41,019
for some reason it was called death man oh it's called toe jamming earth was a side scrolling

64
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:49,460
action game it was like a clone of one of those famous Japanese games but it was so cool these

65
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:55,379
aliens from the planet death take over earth and they print the human scores on their arms

66
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:04,460
intelligence and beauty if either score drops below 100 they get killed a murder show begins

67
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:12,120
oh the murder show trope right but one man put a stop to this terrible game that's right it's

68
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:18,980
death man death man fights against the death aliens to protect the planet earth he kills off

69
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:27,580
all 10 of the top evil death aliens then when he kills general death at the end

70
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:38,539
death man reveals his true identity it's Travis touchdown is that man how did it end I totally

71
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:47,450
forgot the watch mojo and is still unsolved for me and we're pretty sure oh yeah that lady that

72
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:52,259
does that voice remake version and we're pretty sure that they're looking for a comeback we find

73
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:58,759
out who death man really is finally they probably have they probably

74
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:12,600
death oh and don't forget the uh the the 10 to 20 gift clips of a friends episode oh there's

75

android blood what is he saying voice the fuck out as you can see things got all funky

169
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:41,400
quick probably some planet eating type dude waiting all yoked and powerful and trying to

170
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:49,369
take over the world or something this looks so good but don't you worry let's hold on

171
00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:56,890
what i don't read any reviews i don't care they're totally i just go in blind i don't touch down

172
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:02,920
let's let's play here to save the world i'm also just a passing assassin

173
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:15,049
here we go taking a kill trip on death road especially with the game even looking forward

174
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:21,460
to right it's me now i feel bad for the people that did that with cyberpunk but you know what

175
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:26,680
to do i've been looking forward to this for like the last three or four years more than that

176
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:35,579
kill them all the insanity travis let it fly there we go primitive insanity

177
00:28:36,789 --> 00:28:43,500
safeguarded insanity so we're just going right into a boss or something like this right immediately

178
00:28:43,500 --> 00:29:05,660
into a dash oh okay press it in too many beers oh shit i need a toilet perfect location oh yeah

179
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:11,420
don't forget always stop by the toilet if you find one especially before boss fights you need time to

180
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:20,579
get your thoughts in order so you know save your damn game i like how they did make him older

181
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:40,039
right saving i'm i want to play the mini games i'm so excited i can't wait access the sushi shop

182
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:53,500
this is the sushi shop hey irash i i am bug zaburo yummy yummy yummy get some fish in your tummy

183
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:59,029
probably thinking what's a sushi place doing inside of a ufo like this right well but listen

184
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:05,059
i used to have a shop in santa destroy but it got sucked up in that light from the sky and i

185
00:30:05,059 --> 00:30:11,460
ended up in here somehow anyways enough about my problems how about some sushi buddy use l and r

186
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:17,019
to choose take out or eat in take out is well exactly what it sounds like grab a quick bite

187
00:30:17,019 --> 00:30:22,869
when you get hungry during battle what's this a counter over on the right side why is it counting

188
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:28,470
okay so you can take with you eat it means you can sit here and get filled up and get

189
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:36,140
ripped rarin to go for the next battle it's like monster hunter okay we have excellent choices

190
00:30:36,859 --> 00:30:44,019
i'm a huge fan of dawn my sushi they've got all sorts of sushi to choose from so she's actually

191
00:30:44,019 --> 00:30:49,799
a crucial item in battle eat in sushi effects will last till your next battle ends okay so it

192
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:55,460
is like monster hunter you know like what gamers call a buff take out sushi can be eaten during a

193
00:30:55,460 --> 00:31:00,579
battle you'll be left vulnerable while eating so be careful use the left and right d pad to select

194
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:07,940
you take out sushi and eat it huh interesting replenishes health when eaten during battle

195
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:28,119
wait is this like a this is the one listen to this for a second this is the theme song

196
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:33,079
holy shit this is good all right the good old cucumber roll replenishes power when eaten so

197
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:38,680
that how fast how long does it take to eat so why would i eat these outside of combat why wouldn't

198
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:46,789
i take it versus your attention when eaten during battle temporarily increases attack power when

199
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:52,730
eaten improves your chances on the slash reel when eaten during battle partially replenishes

200
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:59,579
death skill gauge during cooldown when eaten during battle so wait does this okay so increases your

201
00:31:59,579 --> 00:32:06,299
tension is that just gonna happen press r oh shit there's two tabs what am i stupid all right what's

202
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:15,849
this load with only the best fish when you die you replenish your health that's huge enter into

203
00:32:15,849 --> 00:32:22,460
battle with greatly increased health attack power and tension significantly increased health attack

204
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:27,769
power intention all right so this is the big one of the of these three i feel like i want to spend

205
00:32:27,769 --> 00:32:35,990
all this money just try it out and see what happens chef's choice enemies more easily stunned

206
00:32:36,549 --> 00:32:43,930
celebrates the all right let's it's the tutorial boss right i'm gonna just take i'll bring some

207
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:56,470
of the health health and power three two i can only buy one wait can i only buy it once oh shit i can

208
00:32:56,470 --> 00:33:01,109
only buy i can i have to i get it when i buy one thing i get out of the menu all right well

209
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:05,269
whatever this is fun no no we're good all right well not that i'm not gonna spend let's go i'm

210
00:33:05,269 --> 00:33:13,559

211
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:29,019
let's see how just how bad this is is that five thousand dollars i don't want to spend it all

212
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:40,500
i got two heels crystal body from outer space bone they came to take over the earth his right hand

213
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:44,900
seems to be holding a weapon it's actually the mutated bone of his hand oh and he's able to

214
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:49,480
stretch it far out this is where the name bone comes from cool one-on-one he's not so tough

215
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:53,339
but watch out his weapon attacks have plenty of range this dude's just a goomba

216
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:09,510
here we go he has a switch controller that's so oh i love it i'm not gonna hold back jumping

217
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:15,260
attacks okay first b to attack while jumping normal jump attacks y are great for showing off

218
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:21,269
homing function will bring you right to your target too all right you want to scatter a bunch

219
00:34:21,269 --> 00:34:25,190
of surrounding enemies try unleashing a heavy jump attack it feels so good it's addictive

220
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:32,900
they leave you wide open though okay that is cool yeah it's like a big down smash

221
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:39,769
once an enemy attack is just about to land use a to dodge and slow down time that's a perfect

222
00:34:39,769 --> 00:34:44,409
dodge this is your chance to beat the living shit out of your opponent or easily only some

223
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:54,460
pro wrestling moves all right cool let's win sweet perfect dodge oh you wanted okay you want

224
00:34:54,460 --> 00:35:02,019
to follow up with it while pummeling enemies you'll sometimes see a star up here above their heads

225
00:35:02,739 --> 00:35:09,719
this is your chance to stun them right once done an enemy can be knocked the hell out with zr

226
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,159
succeed and you'll get your power replenished as an extra added bonus all right so when you're

227
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:16,519
beating people up they get these these star and you can like boom you can stun them

228
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:23,349

231
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:58,300
set of techniques is your death glove skill start off by mastering the death kick skill hold l and

232
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:03,500
use b to activate it warp right up to your enemy and drop kick their ass into next week the death

233
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:18,630

01:11:14,409 --> 01:11:25,369
i'm going out where to i want i want gold joe to be my friend i don't want to like heart kill

407
01:11:25,369 --> 01:11:40,840
gold joe that's another title card what is going on what the fuck is happening this is supposed to

408
01:11:40,840 --> 01:12:00,739
be a tv show that's so funny like we're just sitting here binging a television show we're

409
01:12:00,739 --> 01:12:11,640
playing a game so what do you think about miike's latest production the girls series was a proving

410
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:18,279
ground miike used it to help him get to the next stage it's like a treasure chest of production

411
01:12:18,279 --> 01:12:24,279
by preparing so many different stages to test out just how far japanese cg technology can go

412
01:12:24,279 --> 01:12:29,079
attention channel he's pouring his passion into the improvement of systematized techniques

413
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:36,279
damn travis you really hit the nail on the head the incubator of the new idol chosen in the audition

414
01:12:36,359 --> 01:12:41,479
that's just his transient form and nobody notices that the true awesomeness of miike

415
01:12:41,479 --> 01:12:45,560
is in the fact that he used this film shoot as a way to further his own technical stuff

416
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:52,279
so basically in the next yakuza apocalypse style full-on miike film these systematized

417
01:12:52,279 --> 01:12:58,760
techniques are really going to come alive right so weird case of greedy dude the hell of greedy dude

418
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:08,550
that takashi miike man i guess they're here looks like it's about time to get to work yeah

488
01:27:35,270 --> 01:27:39,289
okay why do you say that oh because i'm playing a minigame for more than five minutes

489
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:46,520
instant gratification zoomers

490
01:27:53,479 --> 01:28:01,939
yeah i mean here's the thing people talk about and you know you've heard me say before like

491
01:28:02,579 --> 01:28:06,819
oh zoomers well what like it's not a tick tock video it's not a vine yeah it's more than five

492
01:28:06,819 --> 01:28:12,180
seconds right but this is also the same generation that will binge watch an entire series of an anime

493
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:17,539
in three days into the circle now that's that takes a look that that's attention that's a

494
01:28:17,539 --> 01:28:25,300
lot of attention span so i don't know if i buy the like zoomers don't have an attention span

495
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:35,000
anymore but that's instant gratification i guess you could say that right

496
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:42,949
fuck it's actually hard to do because like you can you can load up the next episode immediately

497
01:28:46,069 --> 01:28:57,100
yeah god all right all right my previous high score i'm just gonna beat that

499
01:29:05,029 --> 01:29:10,630
the time yeah i would but i was giving a reason as to why i didn't believe the attention span

500
01:29:10,630 --> 01:29:22,010
thing that i hear because you have to sit there for a long time come on bring it that's in that's

501
01:29:22,010 --> 01:29:26,409
in that's in that's in it's all right whatever this that's really difficult and i will be stuck

502
01:29:26,409 --> 01:29:35,819
there for at least like two or three hours later come on bring it you probably get something to

503
01:29:35,819 --> 01:29:43,609
do in at least 20 i love that i can't wait to do that again but for now time to there's a time

504
01:29:43,609 --> 01:30:05,449
to do it's not a worse noise i do that all the time downstairs okay i remember when i had to

505
01:30:05,449 --> 01:30:10,890
wait till next week for the new episode netflix changed things yeah but it's almost like a 50

your bike i gotta pee real bad i'll be right back clog the toilet no just get into water

532
01:38:19,850 --> 01:38:24,090
but i'll tell you clog in the toilet at a hotel is one of the most embarrassing things you can do

533
01:38:24,649 --> 01:38:32,229
if you clog your toilet in your just house or your apartment or wherever uh you have just a plunger

534
01:38:32,229 --> 01:38:40,600
you just easily do it on your own but hotels don't have plungers it's not there's not a plunger in

535
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:46,699
the room like there is an iron which i think is a mistake if you're gonna have an iron in every

536
01:38:46,699 --> 01:38:51,670
single room there should be a plunger in the closet too or something no one on the closet

537
01:38:51,670 --> 01:38:56,390
because if you you don't i mean like because if i clog the toilet in a hotel room you have to call

538
01:38:56,390 --> 01:39:06,250
the front desk and you have to say hi i'm having them uh having a problem with my toilet device

539
01:39:06,250 --> 01:39:13,350
i can send uh maintenance up to have a toilet issue and then they have to come up and they go

540
01:39:13,350 --> 01:39:17,909
all right yeah what's up i was up does it pro is a toilet problem like how why it's so embarrassing

541
01:39:17,909 --> 01:39:24,920

542
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:32,140

664
02:06:30,779 --> 02:06:33,420

02:06:41,060 --> 02:06:46,439
strawberry all right perfect dodge right before you get hit there it is

666
02:06:51,850 --> 02:07:06,500
stunned nope now he is for the four pixels on the block yeah i actually don't know what those are

667
02:07:06,500 --> 02:07:23,909
that's a good question i've yet to figure that out what those are oh it's item slug

668
02:07:27,899 --> 02:07:50,060
that's sushi okay all right finally an s with dead pixel you know what's really weird about

669
02:07:50,060 --> 02:07:57,689
dead pixels so like 10 years ago i feel like they've solved that problem because 10 to 15

670
02:07:57,689 --> 02:08:03,529
years ago every monitor i ever had it was always such a tragic awful event when you would just see

671
02:08:03,529 --> 02:08:08,619
the green dot appear i have not had a dead pixel on any monitor that i've had in the last probably

672
02:08:08,619 --> 02:08:17,720
five years but it used to happen all the time so what i have to do three coins or something

673
02:08:17,720 --> 02:08:30,489
this is my bike i remember sitting there with my fingernail out just tapping it a hundred times

674
02:08:31,689 --> 02:08:40,260
there was so many weird old wives tales how to fix a dead pixel get a cloth put the cloth over the

675
02:08:40,260 --> 02:08:46,260
dead pixel take a hammer slightly tap the hammer onto the cloth onto the pixel and then rub garlic

676
02:08:46,260 --> 02:09:06,729
under your armpits none of them ever actually even did anything oh it's a scorpion how do i

677
02:09:06,729 --> 02:09:25,590
get it i get it it smells fruity it reminds me of uh creepy crawlers creepy crawlers those weird

678
02:09:25,590 --> 02:09:50,220
like plastic gel um they like smelled didn't they oh goodness triple putt watch out for his charges

679
02:09:50,220 --> 02:09:55,380
when he turns invisible if you can dodge him then get behind him and whoop his ass bouncing all over

680
02:09:55,380 --> 02:10:01,130
the place like that he's gonna try to hit and run me i gotta find a way to take him down they can

681
02:10:01,130 --> 02:10:10,060
turn invisible and then wait for them to come out of invisibility i all right i will say that i

682
02:10:10,060 --> 02:10:14,789
really like this one so far out of the two or three of them that have been out there so far

683
02:10:15,510 --> 02:10:21,319
because it's not just guy in a suit almost every single enemy in the other normal heroes games

684
02:10:21,319 --> 02:10:35,500
were just dudes with bats or guys in suits so there's like actual variety in the enemy

685
02:10:35,500 --> 02:11:01,420
types which is really cool all right let's see what do you got come on whoa he jumped over it

686
02:11:01,420 --> 02:11:19,539
what's the pokemon that is looking all the huge arms like this man champ yep grab him grab him

687
02:11:19,539 --> 02:11:57,289
it's not his name what's his name my champ whatever man champ my champ so there's a blue

688
02:11:57,289 --> 02:12:04,539
and a red one the blue one is probably just optional i assume right well i'm becoming

689
02:12:04,539 --> 02:12:21,529
obsessive so i'm starting to become a little obsessive i want to do them all although i

690
02:12:21,529 --> 02:12:28,229

747
02:25:08,069 --> 02:25:25,500
i'll be good back it up inefficient andy it doesn't need to be efficient just need to get done fast

748
02:25:26,299 --> 02:26:01,750

wesson now i can get the shirt is there another level a little too everything's fine let you know

750
02:26:12,870 --> 02:26:29,719
if anything comes up all right getting it done fast is what efficiency is well but what an

751
02:26:29,719 --> 02:26:37,620
efficiency you can be really fast and do a terrible job that's not efficient if you go so fast that

752
02:26:37,620 --> 02:26:43,260
you fuck the whole thing up you're just doing it as you're rushing that's not efficient if it's bad

753
02:26:43,260 --> 02:26:54,469
efficient is fast and well exactly just because you sprint 100 miles per hour and go really fast

754
02:26:54,469 --> 02:27:02,120
doesn't mean you did a good job that means that's inefficient you're bad at both though that's fine

755
02:27:02,120 --> 02:27:11,180
don't listen to the haters yeah i know what the fuck there's a bunch of haters

756
02:27:11,180 --> 02:27:18,840

pretty clean to kick more for the high score yeah i keep forgetting i have it so that's that now

767

792
02:35:42,579 --> 02:35:50,440
against the other rankers basically it's a bunch of boss battles okay you've got toilet breaks

793
02:35:50,440 --> 02:35:56,360
sushi you can buy the power-up machine and death glove chips use all these to add your advantage

794
02:35:56,360 --> 02:36:01,350
and be sure to prepare yourself for the deadly battles ahead good luck interesting

800
02:37:48,620 --> 02:37:59,930
machine hey creepy ass otaku i'll use my power-up machine to enhance your skills for you stick in

801
02:37:59,930 --> 02:38:08,969
all the wesson you got it's a power-up machine in dr naomi's lab by feeding wesson worlds and

802
02:38:08,969 --> 02:38:12,409
supernova into the power-up machine you can enhance your health attack power power and

803
02:38:12,409 --> 02:38:17,219
cooldown time required for using skills you can also use it to acquire new techniques

804
02:38:18,020 --> 02:38:22,219
you can readjust your various status levels so try tweaking the balance till you find your

805
02:38:22,219 --> 02:38:34,090
sweet spot and don't worry you can get back the wesson you put in power how do i do this a down

806
02:38:34,729 --> 02:38:49,750
okay this is my power health attack power battery power level two death skill

807
02:38:50,469 --> 02:39:01,159
for dash attack shake that to special ties when handheld style hold on i'm not gonna read this

808
02:39:01,159 --> 02:39:12,940
again while dashing shake allows you to special attack okay so while i'm running i shake and i

809
02:39:12,940 --> 02:39:19,129
can do a jumping slash cool is there anything else i can do i probably should do health right

810
02:39:19,129 --> 02:39:28,540
that makes the most sense right now well i love this game i love this game this is very good

811
02:39:29,340 --> 02:39:40,780
i'll do attack as well yeah i'm gonna do attack again hey i'm gonna do attack again

812
02:39:41,420 --> 02:39:47,260
fuck i don't have money power level definitely i'm the battery andy let me i'm gonna do this twice

813
02:39:50,280 --> 02:40:04,790
i don't want to deal with this can i do any more it's 1200 that looks pretty good for now

814
02:40:04,790 --> 02:40:18,360
no special moves though i'm sorry that's cool time machine what is a time machine

815
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:24,569
it's a time machine in dr naomi's lab you can use it to have rematches against rankers you

816
02:40:24,569 --> 02:40:29,370
fought in the past set the difficulty level higher to receive more awesome rewards for winning

817
02:40:30,010 --> 02:40:48,620
so you just it's like a boss farm interesting okay death glove chip here you can equip and

818
02:40:48,620 --> 02:41:00,389
create death glove chips what do you want to do equip here's the supercomputer access this to

819
02:41:00,389 --> 02:41:05,610
create and equip death glove chips items which provide a wide range of special effects up to

820
02:41:05,690 --> 02:41:10,329
three death glove chips can be equipped at once each chip has a strength and weakness find the

821
02:41:10,329 --> 02:41:14,950
one that best suits your needs because i don't have any chips so let's say we're going to create

822
02:41:16,309 --> 02:41:23,219
this keeps up this game of the year let me tell you right now the security access that's great

823
02:41:23,219 --> 02:41:27,940
and equip death glove chips okay to create a chip you'll need junk for raw materials

824
02:41:29,290 --> 02:41:37,430
and utopia coins to pay for development costs okay that's what the weird material i've been

825
02:41:37,430 --> 02:41:42,260
getting junk is dropped by enemies and can be received as a reward for clearing volunteer

826
02:41:42,260 --> 02:41:47,860
missions right like i've been doing and junk has different rarity the rarer the junk the harder

827
02:41:47,860 --> 02:41:56,040
it is to find right so i have 500 bucks number one great chip trigger chip

828
02:42:01,159 --> 02:42:15,110
what the fuck what there are 52 of these which i do how about number 35 that's how old i am so

okay hold on after successful guard power consumed 20 down you'll get it later oh this is cool

831
02:42:46,440 --> 02:42:54,219
normal attack power down five percent heavy attack power 10 up i don't know i kind of like that

832
02:42:54,620 --> 02:43:02,969
it's five start at the top so as you take more damage but you do more damage

833
02:43:10,409 --> 02:43:15,610
the world got psychonauts 2 and no more heroes 3 in a week we really do not deserve this

834

880
02:52:50,120 --> 02:53:10,409
let me move this that's then it's not the joke worst unfinished joke you're so cringe germa no

881
02:53:10,409 --> 02:53:16,219
that said never change germa i just that was what i wanted to say matted it for some reason why

that oh i love that you guys are doing that now it's not just me all right i'm ready let's do

885
02:54:10,389 --> 02:54:25,100
old joe this is totally different from the last spaceship so if their technology is different it

886
02:54:25,100 --> 02:54:29,979
means these guys have all come from different planets this sounds dangerous we got to think

887
02:54:29,979 --> 02:54:36,459
of a way to strike back just remember that earth also counts as a planet in space bloodthirsty

888
02:54:36,459 --> 02:54:41,819
people are generally the same everywhere now come on let's go all right so what's your deal

889
02:54:53,239 --> 02:54:57,799
he's about to change uh to get into the shower that's the only that's the move you do before

890
02:54:57,799 --> 02:55:07,049
the pixelation comes on

891
02:55:33,049 --> 02:55:38,969
something to think that you'd be ahead of us in this sort of artwork also that's way too much

892
02:55:38,969 --> 02:55:44,649
time wasted on something like simple projection mapping don't waste budget money on shit like this

893
02:55:57,659 --> 02:56:01,020
well judging by what i see i'm assuming you use magnets huh

894
02:56:04,299 --> 02:56:11,579
snap crackle and pippity poppity poopity so you're going to use blue and red magnetic north south

895
02:56:11,579 --> 02:56:23,879
to bust out some just slightly puzzlish attacks right damn that's what i thought bingo okay i'm

896
02:56:23,879 --> 02:56:30,520
just gonna put this out there for red throw up an n mark above your head and throw up an s for blue

897
02:56:30,600 --> 02:56:35,559
okay will make it simpler gamers like that kind of thing what does that mean i don't know if i can

02:56:35,559 --> 02:56:44,360
it's a red and blue as you say but i'll try my best nice now show me a good time what do how do

Blue.

922
03:01:32,790 --> 03:01:46,159
Ha, ha, ha.

923
03:01:46,159 --> 03:01:48,909
All right, phase three.

03:01:48,909 --> 03:01:50,979
Back it up.

925
03:01:50,979 --> 03:01:53,379
Holy fucking shit, that was a lot of damage.

926
03:01:54,659 --> 03:02:06,059
Red, got it already.

927
03:02:06,059 --> 03:02:07,850
What do you got?

928
03:02:07,850 --> 03:02:16,079
Oh, I'm already blue.

929
03:02:17,040 --> 03:02:19,770
I'm already blue.

930
03:02:19,770 --> 03:02:25,389
What's he doing?

931
03:02:25,389 --> 03:02:36,020
Oh, red.

932
03:02:36,020 --> 03:02:40,819
Get over here.

933
03:02:40,819 --> 03:02:42,209
Goodness.

934
03:02:42,209 --> 03:02:45,020
We don't want color, color, color, color.

935
03:02:45,020 --> 03:02:46,549
Color, what color?

936
03:02:46,549 --> 03:02:50,860
Pick one, pick a color.

937
03:02:50,860 --> 03:02:57,209
Blue, got it.

938
03:02:57,209 --> 03:03:01,399
All right, say goodnight, so.

939
03:03:01,399 --> 03:03:04,639
Oh, oh, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.

940
03:03:04,639 --> 03:03:07,360
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

941
03:03:07,360 --> 03:03:15,200
Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat.

942
03:03:15,200 --> 03:03:21,079
God, I got him.

943
03:03:21,079 --> 03:03:27,020
I almost just died there.

944
03:03:27,020 --> 03:03:27,979
That was cool.

945
03:03:27,979 --> 03:03:43,180
I don't know if that's it, we're still in space.

946
03:03:43,180 --> 03:03:44,860
Old Joe is dead.

947
03:03:44,860 --> 03:03:45,700
Oh, I guess not.

948
03:03:45,700 --> 03:03:48,500
I guess he's just dead.

949
03:03:48,500 --> 03:03:49,819
I know, Adam Sandlin noises.

950
03:03:49,819 --> 03:03:52,100
I'm gonna do those when I get into a situation

951
03:03:52,100 --> 03:03:55,399
where I'm scared.

952
03:03:55,399 --> 03:03:57,440
Is this the shit you've been smuggling?

953
03:03:57,440 --> 03:04:00,239
Wow, you're a real shitty guy, huh?

954
03:04:00,239 --> 03:04:03,159
Um, you probably shouldn't touch that stuff.

955
03:04:03,159 --> 03:04:05,000
It's super dangerous.

956
03:04:05,000 --> 03:04:08,559
It'll melt stuff, like everything.

957
03:04:08,559 --> 03:04:10,280
That's why it makes such good money.

958
03:04:13,340 --> 03:04:14,540
All right, then.

959
03:04:14,540 --> 03:04:15,940
Bon appétit.

960
03:04:16,780 --> 03:04:18,340
No, anything but that!

961
03:04:18,340 --> 03:04:43,940
It's a Stardew Valley.

962
03:04:43,940 --> 03:04:49,440
Damn.

963
03:04:49,440 --> 03:04:51,719
It's the ones who don't look like bad guys

964
03:04:51,719 --> 03:04:53,559
who are the real bad guys.

965
03:04:55,659 --> 03:05:02,020
I see again.

966
03:05:02,020 --> 03:05:04,780
Oh, well.

967
03:05:04,780 --> 03:05:05,780
Somebody's saying I gotta use that.

968
03:05:05,780 --> 03:05:10,020
How often does that kick refresh?

969
03:05:10,020 --> 03:05:11,379
I did take a lot of damage, though.

970
03:05:11,379 --> 03:05:12,219
I mean, come on.

971
03:05:12,219 --> 03:05:13,059
The first time you see a boss,

972
03:05:13,059 --> 03:05:16,479
I can go back in time traveling and get an S.

973
03:05:16,479 --> 03:05:27,139
It's like every 30 seconds, every few minutes.

974
03:05:27,139 --> 03:05:27,979
That was a cool fight, though.

975
03:05:27,979 --> 03:05:32,319
That was fun.

976
03:05:32,319 --> 03:05:34,000
Congratulations.

977
03:05:34,000 --> 03:05:36,479
You have been recognized as number nine

978
03:05:36,479 --> 03:05:38,440
in the galactic rankings.

979
03:05:39,319 --> 03:05:40,559
What's that light?

980
03:05:40,559 --> 03:05:42,280
Is it flying?

981
03:05:42,280 --> 03:05:43,120
Well, yeah.

982
03:05:43,120 --> 03:05:44,399
Talbot?

983
03:05:44,399 --> 03:05:45,840
You guys are up.

984
03:05:45,840 --> 03:05:49,319
You know, I never actually knew those dudes' names till now.

985
03:05:49,319 --> 03:05:51,719
The series is going to keep going, right?

986
03:05:51,719 --> 03:05:53,840
So we kinda had to give them names.

987
03:05:53,840 --> 03:05:56,120
Council style, huh?

988
03:05:56,120 --> 03:05:57,440
You like it, don't you?

989
03:05:57,440 --> 03:05:58,399
They have names, yeah.

990
03:05:58,399 --> 03:06:00,600
Not bad, but whatever.

991
03:06:00,600 --> 03:06:02,120
This is space, right?

992
03:06:02,120 --> 03:06:04,000
Can we do the small talk later?

993
03:06:04,000 --> 03:06:04,840
Space?

994
03:06:04,840 --> 03:06:06,440
You're still at the number nine spot.

995
03:06:06,440 --> 03:06:07,959
You've got a ways to go.

996
03:06:08,840 --> 03:06:09,680
Okay.

997
03:06:09,680 --> 03:06:10,520
I thought you couldn't touch those.

998
03:06:10,520 --> 03:06:13,399
But before all that, I wanna ask you something.

999
03:06:13,399 --> 03:06:17,559
Also, I need to talk to you.

1000
03:06:17,559 --> 03:06:18,799
You ask me something?

1001
03:06:18,799 --> 03:06:20,440
Why are you helping them?

1002
03:06:20,440 --> 03:06:22,000
Is it because it's your job?

1003
03:06:22,000 --> 03:06:23,120
It is for you.

1004
03:06:23,120 --> 03:06:25,799
I mean, being your wife and all.

1005
03:06:25,799 --> 03:06:28,959
I do what I can to help my husband out.

1006
03:06:28,959 --> 03:06:30,920
What does that even mean?

1007
03:06:30,920 --> 03:06:33,840
These guys are basically evil aliens.

1008
03:06:34,680 --> 03:06:36,920
We do not know when they might swarm Earth.

1009
03:06:36,920 --> 03:06:39,840
So we need some kind of order here.

1010
03:06:39,840 --> 03:06:41,000
Yeah, that's true.

1011
03:06:41,000 --> 03:06:43,719
If we're using the same type of ranking system as usual,

1012
03:06:43,719 --> 03:06:46,239
then I've got a lot more experience.

1013
03:06:46,239 --> 03:06:51,000
That is why the UAA is running this thing.

1014
03:06:51,000 --> 03:06:52,200
Are they married?

1015
03:06:52,200 --> 03:06:53,959
Are the kids doing okay?

1016
03:06:53,959 --> 03:06:55,440
I don't remember that at the end of the second game.

1017
03:06:55,440 --> 03:06:56,920
We do not have time.

1018
03:06:56,920 --> 03:06:58,760
I will set up the match for the next ranking battle.

1019
03:06:58,760 --> 03:07:00,120
I said, what, did you say kids?

1020
03:07:00,120 --> 03:07:02,479
Make sure you kill them dead.

1021
03:07:02,559 --> 03:07:12,219
Sylvia, I still need to talk to you.

1022
03:07:12,219 --> 03:07:13,979
That's Travis Strikes Back lore.

1023
03:07:20,280 --> 03:07:21,559
I'll just read the Wikipedia page

1024
03:07:21,559 --> 03:07:29,139
for Travis Strikes Back, whatever it is.

1025
03:07:29,139 --> 03:07:40,350
All right, so we're number nine.

1026
03:07:40,350 --> 03:07:41,190
Oh, the intro.

1027
03:07:41,190 --> 03:07:49,549
Never skip the anime intro and outro.

1028
03:07:49,549 --> 03:07:55,120
I almost just accidentally did.

1029
03:07:55,120 --> 03:07:58,200
Every time you watch an anime intro and outro,

1030
03:07:58,200 --> 03:08:03,750
you experience those same internal dopamine hits.

1031
03:08:03,750 --> 03:08:05,540
Probably you never want to skip them.

1032
03:08:05,540 --> 03:08:07,180
Because everybody has their favorite moment

1033
03:08:07,180 --> 03:08:09,139
in the anime intro or outro.

1034
03:08:09,180 --> 03:08:10,700
Like their favorite character's on screen

1035
03:08:10,700 --> 03:08:13,579
doing something really cool, animated at 60 FPS,

1036
03:08:13,579 --> 03:08:14,780
because they don't do that in the real show,

1037
03:08:14,780 --> 03:08:16,520
the actual show.

1038
03:08:16,520 --> 03:08:18,600
Your favorite character does this like dash, slash, slash,

1039
03:08:18,600 --> 03:08:22,899
jump, eye into the camera at like 700 frames a second.

1040
03:08:22,899 --> 03:08:23,899
You know you're never going to get to see

1041
03:08:23,899 --> 03:08:25,620
that actually happen in the show.

1042
03:08:25,620 --> 03:08:28,530
Maybe you will in some shows.

1043
03:08:28,530 --> 03:08:50,040
Man, looks great in that intro.

1044
03:08:50,040 --> 03:09:01,510
So many shows intros are better than the actual show.

1045
03:09:01,510 --> 03:09:02,430
Game's already over.

1046
03:09:02,430 --> 03:09:04,030
It is not already over.

1047
03:09:21,860 --> 03:09:28,059
Travis Strikes Again next stream, loser.

1048
03:09:28,219 --> 03:09:33,639
Tell me what to do.

1049
03:09:33,639 --> 03:09:35,399
I hope we get, are you still watching?

1050
03:09:35,399 --> 03:09:36,239
That'd be hilarious.

1051
03:09:36,239 --> 03:09:37,319
The guest has arrived.

1052
03:09:37,319 --> 03:09:39,840
Mr. Black Knight direction.

1053
03:09:39,840 --> 03:09:41,940
Huh, let him in.

1054
03:09:41,940 --> 03:09:43,020
All right.

1055
03:09:43,020 --> 03:09:45,459
And just who do we have next?

1056
03:09:45,459 --> 03:09:47,899
The emperor of the night.

1057
03:09:47,899 --> 03:09:49,180
What?

1058
03:09:49,180 --> 03:09:50,780
Do you doubt our power?

1059
03:09:50,780 --> 03:09:51,860
No, no.

1060
03:09:51,860 --> 03:09:54,079
That's not what I meant.

1061
03:09:54,079 --> 03:09:56,399
I was hoping I could be of help.

1062
03:09:56,399 --> 03:09:57,719
You want to help?

1063
03:09:57,719 --> 03:10:00,860
Then sit there quietly.

1064
03:10:00,860 --> 03:10:13,059
Dick.

1065
03:10:13,100 --> 03:10:17,700
Lord Froon had to get to see you again.

1066
03:10:17,700 --> 03:10:21,540
Any wish of yours is old Black Knight directions command.

1067
03:10:21,540 --> 03:10:24,260
Travis must be dealt with.

1068
03:10:24,260 --> 03:10:26,120
I'm leaving him to you.

1069
03:10:26,120 --> 03:10:28,040
Don't let me down.

1070
03:10:28,040 --> 03:10:29,399
I will not let you down.

1071
03:10:29,399 --> 03:10:30,600
Interesting character.

1072
03:10:35,049 --> 03:10:38,860
I feel like there's three people in there.

1073
03:10:38,860 --> 03:10:41,020
Just people standing where the shoulders are.

1074
03:10:41,020 --> 03:10:53,159
And they're all moving as one.

1075
03:10:53,159 --> 03:11:15,020
They're on a custom map, GM flat grass.

1076
03:11:15,020 --> 03:11:17,899
Oh, that's funny.

1077
03:11:17,940 --> 03:11:19,780
What's Mieke's best film?

1078
03:11:19,780 --> 03:11:21,180
That'd be Gozu.

1079
03:11:21,180 --> 03:11:22,340
What do you think?

1080
03:11:22,340 --> 03:11:25,020
Gozu, of course.

1081
03:11:25,020 --> 03:11:27,860
What's the most bad ass Mieke film then?

1082
03:11:27,860 --> 03:11:28,920
Dead or Alive.

1083
03:11:28,920 --> 03:11:29,760
You?

1084
03:11:29,760 --> 03:11:31,239
Shield or Straw.

1085
03:11:31,239 --> 03:11:33,719
Nice.

1086
03:11:33,719 --> 03:11:35,879
What's the most fucked up Mieke film?

1087
03:11:35,879 --> 03:11:37,120
Audition, right?

1088
03:11:37,120 --> 03:11:37,959
Everything you need to-

1089
03:11:37,959 --> 03:11:39,520
Hold on, here it is.

1090
03:11:39,520 --> 03:11:40,680
Visitor Q.

1091
03:11:40,680 --> 03:11:43,120
Oh shit, I haven't seen that one.

1092
03:11:43,120 --> 03:11:44,079
For reals?

1093
03:11:44,079 --> 03:11:46,680
Oh, you gotta see Visitor Q.

1094
03:11:46,680 --> 03:11:48,079
Let me borrow it.

1095
03:11:48,079 --> 03:11:48,920
Nope.

1096
03:11:48,920 --> 03:11:50,360
I'm totally gonna keep it.

1097
03:11:50,360 --> 03:11:51,200
I'll keep it back.

1098
03:11:51,200 --> 03:11:52,879
Come on, you know I will.

1099
03:11:52,879 --> 03:11:53,719
Hell no.

1100
03:11:53,719 --> 03:11:56,659
You always steal my shit after borrowing it.

1101
03:11:56,659 --> 03:11:58,059
Okay, then check this out.

1102
03:11:58,059 --> 03:12:00,700
I'll lend you the whole Kaoru Chan series.

1103
03:12:02,139 --> 03:12:03,579
You're so badass.

1104
03:12:03,579 --> 03:12:05,260
Yeah, Mieke is hella badass.

1105
03:12:05,260 --> 03:12:07,940
By the way, this is all actual film commentary?

1106
03:12:10,549 --> 03:12:11,389
What do you mean?

1107
03:12:11,389 --> 03:12:15,219
That'd be the shit.

1108
03:12:15,219 --> 03:12:18,780
They pulled transcripts from actual film critic stuff?

1109
03:12:18,780 --> 03:12:19,899
They're real.

1110
03:12:19,899 --> 03:12:20,739
Really.

1111
03:12:22,620 --> 03:12:29,100
Oh, I got the Gold Joe T-shirt.

1112
03:12:29,100 --> 03:12:29,940
I kinda need to see that.

1113
03:12:29,940 --> 03:12:38,590
I feel like I'm gonna put that on.

1114
03:12:38,590 --> 03:12:56,350
Ooh, I like that.

1115
03:12:56,350 --> 03:12:57,190
No, no, no, no, no.

1116
03:12:57,190 --> 03:13:04,159
I wanna see.

1117
03:13:04,159 --> 03:13:07,649
Come on.

1118
03:13:07,649 --> 03:13:08,489
I pressed L.

1119
03:13:08,489 --> 03:13:10,909
I don't know why it didn't register.

1120
03:13:10,909 --> 03:13:12,530
L, R.

1121
03:13:12,530 --> 03:13:14,090
I can't switch to L.

1122
03:13:14,090 --> 03:13:18,690
Oh, it's cause this is a whole outfit.

1123
03:13:18,690 --> 03:13:24,700
Oh, I get it.

1124
03:13:24,700 --> 03:13:27,889
Till.

1125
03:13:27,889 --> 03:13:29,450
They're talking about real movies.

1126
03:13:29,450 --> 03:13:32,270
Oh, it was Gold Joe.

1127
03:13:37,219 --> 03:13:45,340
I wish the Gold Joe shirt was actually gold.

1128
03:13:45,340 --> 03:13:50,020
You think it should be gold?

1129
03:13:50,540 --> 03:13:54,469
I'll put that on.

1130
03:13:54,469 --> 03:14:00,100
I'll wear the jacket for a little while.

1131
03:14:00,100 --> 03:14:04,370
And we gotta change our outfit every time we get a chance.

1132
03:14:04,370 --> 03:14:06,709
I don't wanna just wear the same thing.

1133
03:14:06,709 --> 03:14:07,530
Okay, save it.

1134
03:14:07,530 --> 03:14:08,370
Wait, Gene.

1135
03:14:20,549 --> 03:14:24,569
What is the last Japanese movie you watched?

1136
03:14:24,569 --> 03:14:25,889
I don't know.

1137
03:14:25,889 --> 03:14:29,190
I can't tell you the last movie I watched.

1138
03:14:29,190 --> 03:14:30,610
Can I?

1139
03:14:30,610 --> 03:14:32,090
Oh, yes, I can.

1140
03:14:32,090 --> 03:14:49,680
Cromwell.

1141
03:14:49,680 --> 03:14:50,760
Was it good?

1142
03:14:50,760 --> 03:14:51,579
I don't know.

1143
03:14:51,579 --> 03:14:52,420
It was free on YouTube,

1144
03:14:52,420 --> 03:14:53,260
and I was just like,

1145
03:14:53,260 --> 03:14:57,059
this is kinda funny to watch this.

1146
03:14:57,059 --> 03:15:00,629
It's one of those movies where everyone talks like this.

1147
03:15:00,670 --> 03:15:02,829
Will it please the court for them to know

1148
03:15:02,829 --> 03:15:04,989
that Cromwell, I will be exiled?

1149
03:15:04,989 --> 03:15:08,690
Like, it's one of those movies.

1150
03:15:08,690 --> 03:15:10,170
Parliament, parliament needs to,

1151
03:15:10,170 --> 03:15:13,350
I will not stand for parliament.

1152
03:15:13,350 --> 03:15:17,370
We will absolve and dissolve parliament.

1153
03:15:17,370 --> 03:15:18,370
That was the whole movie.

1154
03:15:18,370 --> 03:15:26,280
And then there was a bunch of fight scenes and stuff.

1155
03:15:26,280 --> 03:15:31,770
All right, I gotta kill some more people.

1156
03:15:31,770 --> 03:15:35,129
What was the last Japanese movie you watched?

1157
03:15:35,129 --> 03:15:35,969
Cromwell.

1158
03:15:35,969 --> 03:15:36,969
No, I didn't.

1159
03:15:36,969 --> 03:15:38,090
Cromwell takes place,

1160
03:15:38,090 --> 03:15:42,850
it's based on the English and Ireland and Scotland.

1161
03:15:42,850 --> 03:15:45,010
They're all fighting each other as priests and shit,

1162
03:15:45,010 --> 03:15:46,530
and because they ride horses,

1163
03:15:46,530 --> 03:15:50,090
they throw knives at each other and stuff.

1164
03:15:50,090 --> 03:15:51,370
They have sword fights,

1165
03:15:51,370 --> 03:15:55,409
and I don't know what his name is,

1166
03:15:55,409 --> 03:15:56,489
something Cromwell.

1167
03:15:56,489 --> 03:15:58,930
He ends up becoming the King of England,

1168
03:15:58,930 --> 03:16:02,280
or whatever it was, I don't remember.

1169
03:16:02,280 --> 03:16:05,559
I've slept and woke up three times.

1170
03:16:05,559 --> 03:16:07,899
The ads woke me up, okay?

1171
03:16:07,899 --> 03:16:08,819
I'll be honest with you.

1172
03:16:08,819 --> 03:16:10,180
If you watch YouTube movies for free,

1173
03:16:10,180 --> 03:16:11,379
the ones that are on YouTube,

1174
03:16:11,379 --> 03:16:13,059
there's like 10 ads throughout the movie,

1175
03:16:13,139 --> 03:16:18,559
and they'll wake you up if you're fucking asleep.

1176
03:16:18,559 --> 03:16:21,280
I don't know when the last Japanese movie I watched is.

1177
03:16:21,280 --> 03:16:24,659
I have no idea.

1178
03:16:24,659 --> 03:16:33,799
I don't know.

1179
03:16:33,799 --> 03:16:37,739
You level up, like, oh no, you have to get, okay.

1180
03:16:37,739 --> 03:16:39,260
He never became the King.

1181
03:16:39,260 --> 03:16:42,270
No, he owned Parliament.

1182
03:16:42,270 --> 03:16:44,190
He got rid of Parliament,

1183
03:16:44,190 --> 03:16:46,469
and then he brought back Parliament,

1184
03:16:46,469 --> 03:16:48,829
because the King got rid of Parliament.

1185
03:16:48,829 --> 03:16:50,989
So it was like, we need to fight to get Parliament back.

1186
03:16:50,989 --> 03:16:52,709
I don't know, they said Parliament,

1187
03:16:52,709 --> 03:17:02,510
they said that word like 400 times in the movie.

1188
03:17:02,510 --> 03:17:03,659
Oh, nice.

1189
03:17:03,659 --> 03:17:09,489
Shedded snakeskin.

1190
03:17:09,489 --> 03:17:11,129
And then he became King of Japan.

1191
03:17:17,059 --> 03:17:20,459
What was the last, like, okay, movie based on Japan,

1192
03:17:20,459 --> 03:17:25,559
or in Japan, or like a Japanese film?

1193
03:17:25,559 --> 03:17:33,440
Name some Japanese films that have come out.

1194
03:17:33,440 --> 03:17:39,860
Maybe I've seen them, I don't know.

1195
03:17:39,860 --> 03:17:40,819
Oh, I got a card.

1196
03:17:53,049 --> 03:17:55,409
Romwell's really good.

1197
03:17:55,409 --> 03:18:03,370
I mean, it was entertaining.

1198
03:18:03,370 --> 03:18:04,770
Need to watch Akira.

1199
03:18:04,770 --> 03:18:07,290
I've already seen Akira.

1200
03:18:07,290 --> 03:18:26,850
Two decades ago, whatever, a decade ago.

1201
03:18:26,850 --> 03:18:34,280
Seen Spirited Away, yeah, a long time ago.

1202
03:18:34,280 --> 03:18:36,760
Ooh, Flame Tea.

1203
03:18:37,440 --> 03:18:46,940
Romwell is 45% on Rotten Tomatoes.

1204
03:18:46,940 --> 03:18:48,020
Was it really?

1205
03:18:48,020 --> 03:18:49,459
I mean, I didn't watch the movie

1206
03:18:49,459 --> 03:19:01,360
because I thought it was gonna be a good movie.

1207
03:19:01,360 --> 03:19:03,319
Oh, I also saw the one Lindsay Lohan

1208
03:19:03,319 --> 03:19:05,360
pretends to be pregnant.

1209
03:19:05,360 --> 03:19:07,059
The whole movie.

1210
03:19:07,059 --> 03:19:08,379
I forget what it's called.

1211
03:19:08,379 --> 03:19:09,420
Guys, these are free on YouTube,

1212
03:19:09,420 --> 03:19:11,219
and I'll just load one up for fun in the background.

1213
03:19:11,219 --> 03:19:16,569
Just not even pay attention.

1214
03:19:16,569 --> 03:19:17,770
I don't know, the movie's called, like,

1215
03:19:17,770 --> 03:19:19,010
I'm Expecting or something.

1216
03:19:19,010 --> 03:19:27,059
What's it called?

1217
03:19:27,059 --> 03:19:36,520
Labor Pains, yeah, that's what it's called.

1218
03:19:36,520 --> 03:19:44,340
There's a fight here, hold on.

1219
03:19:44,340 --> 03:19:49,979
Lawn mowing.

1220
03:19:49,979 --> 03:19:52,889
What was the last movie you actually watched?

1221
03:19:57,469 --> 03:19:58,870
I don't know.

1222
03:19:58,870 --> 03:20:00,229
What was the last movie I actually watched?

1223
03:20:00,229 --> 03:20:12,819
I sat down and watched Start to Finish.

1224
03:20:12,819 --> 03:20:15,829
It's, like, so gone from my brain right now.

1225
03:20:15,829 --> 03:20:17,750
The Force Awakens III, what was it called?

1226
03:20:17,750 --> 03:20:22,729
The Sith are always, Eternal Sith, what's it called?

1227
03:20:22,729 --> 03:20:26,600
It was, they all have the same name.

1228
03:20:26,600 --> 03:20:27,440
I'm not gonna look at chat

1229
03:20:27,440 --> 03:20:29,020
because I need to figure this out on my own.

1230
03:20:29,020 --> 03:20:32,329
Star Wars, Attack of the Clones,

1231
03:20:32,329 --> 03:20:33,930
Star Wars The Phantom Menace,

1232
03:20:33,930 --> 03:20:37,180
Star Wars Revenge of the Sith,

1233
03:20:37,180 --> 03:20:39,250
Star Wars A New Hope,

1234
03:20:39,250 --> 03:20:41,319
Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back,

1235
03:20:41,319 --> 03:20:43,100
Star Wars The Return of the Jedi,

1236
03:20:43,139 --> 03:20:44,540
Star Wars The Force Awakens,

1237
03:20:44,540 --> 03:20:46,100
Star Wars The Last Jedi,

1238
03:20:46,100 --> 03:20:53,770
Star Wars The Never-Ending Sith, what is it?

1239
03:20:53,770 --> 03:20:56,690
It's something just like Revenge of the Sith.

1240
03:20:56,690 --> 03:20:59,000
What the fuck is it called?

1241
03:20:59,000 --> 03:21:00,200
I'm not gonna look at chat.

1242
03:21:00,200 --> 03:21:01,930
I'm gonna sit here until I get it

1243
03:21:01,930 --> 03:21:06,059
because this is embarrassing that I don't know this.

1244
03:21:06,059 --> 03:21:10,639
The Way of the Sith, the end of the Sith.

1245
03:21:10,639 --> 03:21:11,879
I don't know the movie.

1246
03:21:11,879 --> 03:21:18,549
Apparently, I don't give a shit about this movie.

1247
03:21:18,549 --> 03:21:20,469
Star Wars The Next Generation.

1248
03:21:20,469 --> 03:21:24,239
No, that's Star Trek.

1249
03:21:24,239 --> 03:21:25,059
I don't know.

1250
03:21:25,059 --> 03:21:27,159
I don't know what the lightest Star Wars movie is

1251
03:21:27,159 --> 03:21:28,639
and it's gonna kill me.

1252
03:21:28,639 --> 03:21:30,200
I am turned around in my chair right now

1253
03:21:30,200 --> 03:21:34,700
to make sure I don't look at the screen.

1254
03:21:34,700 --> 03:21:37,739
Phantom Menace Clone Wars,

1255
03:21:37,739 --> 03:21:40,459
Revenge of the Sith,

1256
03:21:40,459 --> 03:21:42,319
A New Hope,

1257
03:21:42,319 --> 03:21:43,559
Empire Strikes Back,

1258
03:21:43,559 --> 03:21:45,399
Return of the Jedi,

1259
03:21:45,399 --> 03:21:47,829
Force Awakens,

1260
03:21:47,829 --> 03:21:49,879
The Last Jedi,

1261
03:21:49,879 --> 03:21:53,979
and The Last One.

1262
03:21:53,979 --> 03:21:57,469
What is it?

1263
03:21:57,469 --> 03:21:58,430
I can't do it.

1264
03:21:58,430 --> 03:22:02,260
What is it?

1265
03:22:02,260 --> 03:22:03,579
I'm not turning around until I get this.

1266
03:22:03,579 --> 03:22:09,690
This is fucking embarrassing for me.

1267
03:22:09,690 --> 03:22:11,299
The end of the Sith?

1268
03:22:11,299 --> 03:22:13,920
No, the Sith of the,

1269
03:22:13,920 --> 03:22:15,719
the width of the Sith?

1270
03:22:15,719 --> 03:22:19,459
No, that's not it.

1271
03:22:19,500 --> 03:22:23,430
Although that's probably on Pornhub.

1272
03:22:23,430 --> 03:22:24,270
I give up, what is it?

1273
03:22:24,270 --> 03:22:25,090
I have no idea.

1274
03:22:25,090 --> 03:22:30,139
I don't know, what is it?

1275
03:22:30,139 --> 03:22:30,979
I give up.

1276
03:22:30,979 --> 03:22:35,940
What is it?

1277
03:22:35,940 --> 03:22:36,780
I give up.

1278
03:22:36,780 --> 03:22:37,620
Rise of Skywalker.

1279
03:22:37,620 --> 03:22:40,329
Oh my God.

1280
03:22:40,329 --> 03:22:41,170
God.

1281
03:22:41,170 --> 03:22:46,969
How, right.

1282
03:22:46,969 --> 03:22:49,610
The movie was so bad that he forgot it.

1283
03:22:49,610 --> 03:23:03,149
No, it's, ah, whatever.

1284
03:23:03,149 --> 03:23:04,430
I'd like to test out your true fortitude.

1285
03:23:04,430 --> 03:23:07,770
Could you please clean up all the grass?

1286
03:23:07,770 --> 03:23:09,610
As a show of respect for your whimsically good heart,

1287
03:23:09,610 --> 03:23:11,500
I should reward you handsomely.

1288
03:23:11,500 --> 03:23:13,889
But let's be completely honest.

1289
03:23:13,889 --> 03:23:14,709
I don't even,

1290
03:23:14,709 --> 03:23:17,479
if I don't even remember the title of the movie

1291
03:23:17,479 --> 03:23:20,200
and it's in one of the most celebrated franchises ever,

1292
03:23:20,200 --> 03:23:23,260
I probably didn't care that much, right?

1293
03:23:23,260 --> 03:23:28,600
I can't pretend I did.

1294
03:23:28,600 --> 03:23:32,510
All right, let's do another one more.

1295
03:23:32,510 --> 03:23:34,629
Lag X just gave 50 community subs.

1296
03:23:34,629 --> 03:23:36,409
That's insane.

1297
03:23:36,409 --> 03:23:40,010
That's a massive amount of community subs.

1298
03:23:40,010 --> 03:23:43,479
That's hundreds and hundreds of dollars.

1299
03:23:43,479 --> 03:23:45,719
Holy shit.

1300
03:23:45,719 --> 03:23:47,790
Three, two, one.

1301
03:23:47,790 --> 03:23:49,190
Thank you, Lag X.

1302
03:23:49,190 --> 03:23:50,229
That's insane.

1303
03:23:50,229 --> 03:23:51,069
That's a lot of money.

1304
03:23:51,069 --> 03:23:57,000
All right, I'm gonna do this right.

1305
03:23:57,000 --> 03:23:58,600
I really do blame the camera though.

1306
03:23:58,600 --> 03:24:03,639
I'm going to.

1307
03:24:03,639 --> 03:24:23,489
I think doing this like a little spurt, it helps.

1308
03:24:23,489 --> 03:24:36,010
I missed a piece, but all right.

1309
03:24:36,010 --> 03:24:36,850
Next game.

1310
03:24:36,850 --> 03:24:37,770
I'm not doing next game.

1311
03:24:37,770 --> 03:24:38,610
I'm playing this.

1312
03:24:38,610 --> 03:24:39,450
I'm playing Heroes 3, but I've been waiting

1313
03:24:39,450 --> 03:24:40,370
three years for this.

1314
03:24:40,370 --> 03:24:50,930
No, turn, turn, turn.

1315
03:24:50,930 --> 03:25:04,219
Didn't even have to look, but that's good.

1316
03:25:04,219 --> 03:25:11,020
Is there anything higher than gold?

1317
03:25:11,020 --> 03:25:17,370
Thousand, that's it.

1318
03:25:17,370 --> 03:25:19,629
All right, well that's lawn mowing.

1319
03:25:19,629 --> 03:25:21,680
And then I've got this.

1320
03:25:21,680 --> 03:25:23,579
Volume one volunteer mission, sure.

1321
03:25:34,520 --> 03:25:41,920
That was the tutorial.

1322
03:25:41,920 --> 03:25:50,299
Oh my goodness gracious, okay.

1323
03:25:50,299 --> 03:26:09,940
Shit, I didn't know it could overheat.

1324
03:26:09,940 --> 03:26:24,899
Only three minutes.

1325
03:26:24,899 --> 03:26:47,159
I got plenty of time, I'm good.

1326
03:26:47,159 --> 03:26:48,360
I hate turning that camera.

1327
03:26:48,360 --> 03:26:59,030
Camera's the worst, damn it.

1328
03:26:59,030 --> 03:27:00,190
I wish that just turned with you.

1329
03:27:00,190 --> 03:27:04,379
Why do I have to use my other right stick to turn too?

1330
03:27:04,379 --> 03:27:21,639
Oh, fuck you.

1331
03:27:22,639 --> 03:27:27,620
Oh God, give me a break.

1332
03:27:27,620 --> 03:27:35,540
That was not clean, but I'll take the money.

1333
03:27:35,540 --> 03:27:37,100
Using turn signals with a mower.

1334
03:27:37,100 --> 03:27:39,930
Bronze, yuck.

1335
03:27:39,930 --> 03:27:52,110
I don't care.

1336
03:27:52,110 --> 03:27:55,370
New level has been unlocked.

1337
03:27:55,370 --> 03:27:57,540
Be cool.

1338
03:27:57,540 --> 03:27:58,659
All right, new level unlocked.

1339
03:27:58,659 --> 03:28:02,440
It's probably later on.

1340
03:28:02,440 --> 03:28:09,719
There's a toilet over here.

1341
03:28:09,719 --> 03:28:14,989
Oh my goodness.

1342
03:28:14,989 --> 03:28:17,569
Have you ever mowed a lawn in real life?

1343
03:28:17,569 --> 03:28:21,139
Yes, many, many times.

1344
03:28:21,139 --> 03:28:24,420
When I'm mowing the lawn, I don't turn my head backwards

1345
03:28:24,420 --> 03:28:28,950
and use my left and right thumbs to turn.

1346
03:28:28,950 --> 03:28:33,190
Oh, excuse me.

1347
03:28:33,190 --> 03:28:34,270
Where is this?

1348
03:28:34,270 --> 03:28:43,209
Where's this toilet?

1349
03:28:44,129 --> 03:28:45,290
This game blows and it really doesn't.

1350
03:28:45,290 --> 03:28:56,600
I assure you.

1351
03:28:56,600 --> 03:28:57,440
All right.

1352
03:29:04,809 --> 03:29:05,649
Where is it?

1353
03:29:25,319 --> 03:29:35,090
Fuck the haters, no.

1354
03:29:35,090 --> 03:29:41,670
Cereal shitter.

1355
03:29:41,670 --> 03:29:44,889
Oh, the recording thing.

1356
03:29:44,889 --> 03:29:47,889
So confused by that.

1357
03:29:47,889 --> 03:29:52,040
We'll save the game.

1358
03:29:52,040 --> 03:29:56,379
No more heroes is if someone turned the combo's pizza snacks

1359
03:29:56,379 --> 03:29:57,639
into a video game.

1360
03:29:57,639 --> 03:29:59,500
Why do I know what you mean?

1361
03:29:59,500 --> 03:30:00,520
I, yeah, I get it.

1362
03:30:00,520 --> 03:30:10,200
Yeah, that's true.

1363
03:30:10,200 --> 03:30:12,120
It's such a weird thing to understand,

1364
03:30:12,120 --> 03:30:17,700
but I know what that means.

1365
03:30:17,700 --> 03:30:25,299
It's over here.

1366
03:30:25,299 --> 03:30:27,020
By the way, I can't find those anymore.

1367
03:30:27,020 --> 03:30:29,079
You know what else I can't find?

1368
03:30:29,079 --> 03:30:31,780
This is really starting to agitate me.

1369
03:30:31,780 --> 03:30:32,840
Pretzel goldfish.

1370
03:30:32,840 --> 03:30:33,680
What happened to them?

1371
03:30:33,680 --> 03:30:35,700
Where are they?

1372
03:30:35,700 --> 03:30:39,780
I can't find them anywhere.

1373
03:30:39,780 --> 03:30:48,299
Have you noticed that?

1374
03:30:48,299 --> 03:30:52,540
Those are my favorites.

1375
03:30:52,540 --> 03:30:53,620
They still exist here.

1376
03:30:53,620 --> 03:30:55,579
I feel like there's like a few places in the world

1377
03:30:55,579 --> 03:30:56,420
or in the country or something

1378
03:30:56,420 --> 03:31:00,049
that are not getting the supply or something.

1379
03:31:00,049 --> 03:31:01,450
All right, you have the driving skills of a true champion.

1380
03:31:01,450 --> 03:31:03,860
Could you possibly entertain a request?

1381
03:31:03,860 --> 03:31:06,459
These vulgar thugs only able to follow their flock

1382
03:31:06,459 --> 03:31:08,500
have been utterly terrorizing the highway.

1383
03:31:09,219 --> 03:31:11,299
The day my grandmother was on her way to work

1384
03:31:11,299 --> 03:31:13,620
when these cretins almost ran her off the road.

1385
03:31:13,620 --> 03:31:16,299
It was probably me.

1386
03:31:16,299 --> 03:31:17,420
I absolutely cannot abide.

1387
03:31:17,420 --> 03:31:21,409
Please put these criminals in their place.

1388
03:31:21,409 --> 03:31:24,049
Destroy the head runaway car before time runs out.

1389
03:31:24,049 --> 03:31:26,799
Destroy the followers to extend the time limit.

1390
03:31:26,799 --> 03:31:34,020
Don't hit normal cars.

1391
03:31:34,020 --> 03:31:34,840
There's actually a,

1392
03:31:34,840 --> 03:31:39,049
there's a pretzel goldfish shortage.

1393
03:31:39,049 --> 03:31:46,459
It's really sad.

1394
03:31:46,459 --> 03:31:50,139
Okay, accelerate, brake, boost.

1395
03:31:50,139 --> 03:31:53,409
Do I have to smash into them?

1396
03:31:53,409 --> 03:32:02,739
What?

1397
03:32:06,389 --> 03:32:15,219
Holy shit, I'm going too fast.

1398
03:32:15,219 --> 03:32:22,930
Those gems.

1399
03:32:22,930 --> 03:32:23,770
I'm so close.

1400
03:32:24,649 --> 03:32:38,420
Oh, I'm sorry.

1401
03:32:38,420 --> 03:32:39,620
So avoid the cars coming this way.

1402
03:32:39,620 --> 03:32:48,440
That's all I have to do.

1403
03:32:48,440 --> 03:32:49,639
Shit.

1404
03:32:49,639 --> 03:32:50,479
This is, you know what?

1405
03:32:50,479 --> 03:32:52,639
This is the stupid toad level in Mario Kart.

1406
03:32:52,639 --> 03:32:55,399
The highway toads, whatever it's called.

1407
03:32:55,399 --> 03:32:56,920
That's my least favorite Mario Kart level

1408
03:32:56,920 --> 03:33:00,399
in the entire 30 years span of that entire series.

1409
03:33:00,399 --> 03:33:01,239
I hate that level.

1410
03:33:01,239 --> 03:33:11,180
It looks stupid.

1411
03:33:11,180 --> 03:33:21,950
All the toads driving the wrong side of the road.

1412
03:33:21,950 --> 03:33:25,379
Come here.

1413
03:33:25,379 --> 03:33:31,379
Come here.

1414
03:33:31,379 --> 03:33:42,120
There he is.

1415
03:33:42,120 --> 03:33:53,049
Silver, that's fine.

1416
03:33:53,049 --> 03:33:54,049
Make a funny sound.

1417
03:33:54,049 --> 03:33:56,250
I just did.

1418
03:33:56,250 --> 03:33:58,370
I just did the toad finish.

1419
03:33:58,370 --> 03:33:59,209
You just heard it.

1420
03:33:59,209 --> 03:34:00,030
I just did it.

1421
03:34:00,030 --> 03:34:04,940
You just got a funny sound.

1422
03:34:04,940 --> 03:34:05,979
That wasn't funny.

1423
03:34:10,079 --> 03:34:13,500
The whole world doesn't drive on the wrong side of the road.

1424
03:34:13,500 --> 03:34:19,040
But where, okay, but our toad is toads in England?

1425
03:34:19,040 --> 03:34:34,799
Toadville in like Europe?

1426
03:34:34,799 --> 03:34:36,280
Japanese.

1427
03:34:36,280 --> 03:34:40,010
Doesn't Japan drive on the right side of the road?

1428
03:34:40,010 --> 03:34:43,260
I thought Japan drives on the right side of the road.

1429
03:34:43,260 --> 03:34:46,479
There's one or two other countries on earth that do that.

1430
03:34:46,479 --> 03:34:47,319
Where is it?

1431
03:34:47,319 --> 03:34:51,000
Singapore?

1432
03:34:51,000 --> 03:34:51,840
Is it Japan?

1433
03:34:51,840 --> 03:34:54,639
Who does it?

1434
03:34:54,639 --> 03:35:04,040
South Africa, the United States.

1435
03:35:04,040 --> 03:35:04,959
No, I'm serious.

1436
03:35:04,959 --> 03:35:07,270
It's more than a few countries.

1437
03:35:07,270 --> 03:35:17,159
Well, who drives on the right side of the road?

1438
03:35:17,280 --> 03:35:19,879
USA, China, Russia.

1439
03:35:19,879 --> 03:35:20,760
Japan too, right?

1440
03:35:20,760 --> 03:35:26,719
No, not Japan.

1441
03:35:26,719 --> 03:35:27,920
Mexico does, yeah.

1442
03:35:27,920 --> 03:35:34,299
All of South America.

1443
03:35:34,299 --> 03:35:36,299
Japan drives on the left side.

1444
03:35:36,299 --> 03:35:38,940
Well, I haven't seen a Japanese movie in a long time.

1445
03:35:38,940 --> 03:35:47,500
So I don't know anything about Japan apparently.

1446
03:35:47,500 --> 03:35:50,500
Most countries do drive on the right.

1447
03:35:50,500 --> 03:35:53,180
I'm thinking of like the metric system

1448
03:35:53,180 --> 03:35:54,760
versus empirical, right?

1449
03:35:56,079 --> 03:35:57,319
Who is it?

1450
03:35:57,319 --> 03:35:58,440
I got it wrong.

1451
03:35:58,440 --> 03:36:00,239
I'm thinking of like the metric system.

1452
03:36:00,239 --> 03:36:08,120
Who uses empirical?

1453
03:36:08,120 --> 03:36:13,479
Imper, whatever, whatever it's called.

1454
03:36:13,479 --> 03:36:14,319
Who uses it?

1455
03:36:14,319 --> 03:36:17,760
It's the United States and like three other countries.

1456
03:36:21,860 --> 03:36:22,700
I'm not drunk.

1457
03:36:22,700 --> 03:36:28,989
No, I'm not.

1458
03:36:28,989 --> 03:36:38,040
It's the US and Myanmar.

1459
03:36:38,040 --> 03:36:39,319
Okay, let's go.

1460
03:36:39,319 --> 03:36:41,389
How much money do I need?

1461
03:36:41,389 --> 03:36:47,299
Shit.

1462
03:36:47,299 --> 03:36:49,399
I need $25,000.

1463
03:36:49,399 --> 03:36:54,889
How much do I have now?

1464
03:36:54,889 --> 03:37:07,250
I gotta turn around.

1465
03:37:07,250 --> 03:37:09,250
Dude's got a garlic aioli brain.

1466
03:37:09,250 --> 03:37:17,430
No, oh my God.

1467
03:37:17,430 --> 03:37:27,200
There's a toilet over here.

1468
03:37:27,200 --> 03:37:32,280
Let's make some money.

1469
03:37:32,280 --> 03:37:34,319
This game is, this game's tight, it is.

1470
03:37:34,319 --> 03:37:37,899
This game is awesome.

1471
03:37:37,899 --> 03:37:38,739
Where are these missions?

1472
03:37:38,739 --> 03:37:48,209
This one's like over here.

1473
03:37:48,209 --> 03:37:52,229
Hello.

1474
03:37:52,229 --> 03:37:57,149
You eat raw cloves, admit it.

1475
03:37:57,149 --> 03:37:59,790
I mean, look, I don't wanna tell people

1476
03:37:59,790 --> 03:38:03,909
to eat raw cloves of garlic because it's really, really harsh.

1477
03:38:03,909 --> 03:38:06,110
I already did this shit like three days ago.

1478
03:38:06,110 --> 03:38:09,180
I'm not gonna go over this again.

1479
03:38:09,180 --> 03:38:10,899
Blah, blah, blah, blah, garlic.

1480
03:38:10,899 --> 03:38:12,379
When you crush garlic, allicin comes out

1481
03:38:12,379 --> 03:38:15,739
and when you cook garlic, it gets rid of a lot of the allicin.

1482
03:38:15,739 --> 03:38:22,739
I don't know, we don't have to go over this again.

1483
03:38:22,739 --> 03:38:25,940
It's actually, eating raw garlic is really intense

1484
03:38:25,940 --> 03:38:29,059
and I do not really recommend people do that.

1485
03:38:29,059 --> 03:38:34,379
But, you know, just I'm telling you.

1486
03:38:34,379 --> 03:38:35,819
Pickled garlic is really good.

1487
03:38:35,819 --> 03:38:38,079
Garlic, anything is good.

1488
03:38:38,079 --> 03:38:41,649
I love that shit so much, you have no idea.

1489
03:38:41,649 --> 03:38:43,940
Empty cans littered everywhere.

1490
03:38:43,940 --> 03:38:48,459
He's going to dispose of all the garbage.

1491
03:38:48,459 --> 03:38:51,500
Pick up all the empty cans.

1492
03:39:03,510 --> 03:39:06,309
Okay, press the A button to pick up trash.

1493
03:39:06,309 --> 03:39:07,709
If you're attacked by an alligator,

1494
03:39:07,709 --> 03:39:10,209
press the button displayed on the screen.

1495
03:39:10,209 --> 03:39:27,090
Uh, watch out for alligators.

1496
03:39:27,090 --> 03:39:30,459
Crash, crash, I couldn't even read what that said.

1497
03:39:30,459 --> 03:39:32,659
That was an A upside down.

1498
03:39:32,659 --> 03:39:34,819
That was an upside down A.

1499
03:39:34,819 --> 03:39:40,340
I can't, this is hard.

1500
03:39:40,340 --> 03:39:50,600
That's what I know, but like it looked like a fucking A.

1501
03:39:50,600 --> 03:39:56,299
Where's the rest of the trash?

1502
03:39:56,299 --> 03:40:04,340
Crash, I don't see anymore, where's it?

1503
03:40:04,340 --> 03:40:11,489
Where's the pieces of trash?

1504
03:40:11,530 --> 03:40:17,239
There's no trash left.

1505
03:40:17,239 --> 03:40:23,620
I don't see any trash, that's, okay.

1506
03:40:23,620 --> 03:40:29,200
Ugh, listen, this is why I'm going to go

1507
03:40:29,200 --> 03:40:30,360
on a fucking rant here.

1508
03:40:30,360 --> 03:40:32,629
I'm going to go on a huge rant.

1509
03:40:32,629 --> 03:40:33,909
I don't know if people are going to think I'm an idiot

1510
03:40:33,909 --> 03:40:36,020
and stupid and whatever.

1511
03:40:36,020 --> 03:40:38,780
Why, there should have been a goddamn Congress law

1512
03:40:38,780 --> 03:40:41,459
that all video game consoles should just have

1513
03:40:41,459 --> 03:40:44,440
the same letters and same button mappings.

1514
03:40:44,440 --> 03:40:46,540
But they're like face buttons.

1515
03:40:46,540 --> 03:40:50,860
Cause like Xbox, X is where the Y is.

1516
03:40:50,860 --> 03:40:52,420
B is where the A is.

1517
03:40:53,379 --> 03:40:54,219
Triangle is where the X is.

1518
03:40:54,219 --> 03:40:56,059
If you play all the consoles equally,

1519
03:40:56,059 --> 03:41:00,579
I play all consoles equally, all of them.

1520
03:41:00,579 --> 03:41:05,180
When I put into muscle memory where A is on Xbox One,

1521
03:41:05,180 --> 03:41:07,870
that is where A is on Switch.

1522
03:41:07,870 --> 03:41:09,989
There should be a goddamn Congress law

1523
03:41:09,989 --> 03:41:12,809
that states that has to be there.

1524
03:41:12,809 --> 03:41:13,649
And that's not even important,

1525
03:41:13,649 --> 03:41:15,010
it's a literally first world problem

1526
03:41:15,010 --> 03:41:26,209
and nobody really cares, do it again.

1527
03:41:26,209 --> 03:41:28,829
But that's my only defense.

1528
03:41:28,829 --> 03:41:33,860
Is when I see Y on the screen, I press Y on Xbox.

1529
03:41:33,860 --> 03:41:35,819
If I see X on screen, I might press X

1530
03:41:35,819 --> 03:41:37,540
where it is on PlayStation.

1531
03:41:38,500 --> 03:41:40,579
It's wherever my muscle memory of my brain

1532
03:41:40,579 --> 03:41:42,930
decides to go for that moment.

1533
03:41:42,930 --> 03:41:44,569
Unless you play on one console, obviously,

1534
03:41:44,569 --> 03:41:45,850
then you're not gonna have this problem at all.

1535
03:41:45,850 --> 03:41:54,180
But you know, whatever.

1536
03:41:54,180 --> 03:41:55,459
It's usually the last console

1537
03:41:55,459 --> 03:41:57,020
that I spent the most time with.

1538
03:41:57,020 --> 03:42:00,170
So I was playing a lot of Xbox before this

1539
03:42:00,170 --> 03:42:03,450
and I use my Xbox controller on PC all the time.

1540
03:42:03,450 --> 03:42:09,799
So, and where is the rest of the trash?

1541
03:42:09,799 --> 03:42:14,940
Am I freaking out here?

1542
03:42:14,940 --> 03:42:23,649
You see that?

1543
03:42:23,649 --> 03:42:27,459
Rotate, the camera wouldn't rotate anymore after that.

1544
03:42:27,459 --> 03:42:28,979
I was literally trying to rotate the camera

1545
03:42:28,979 --> 03:42:30,379
and it wouldn't rotate any further

1546
03:42:30,379 --> 03:42:35,950
to see the other side, I promise you.

1547
03:42:35,950 --> 03:42:43,290
Play the seal video, I already did it.

1548
03:42:43,290 --> 03:42:57,579
Hey, is it tutorial again?

1549
03:42:57,579 --> 03:43:05,659
I wanna do the actual mission, there we go.

1550
03:43:05,659 --> 03:43:08,549
Play it again, I will in a minute.

1551
03:43:26,299 --> 03:43:28,700
Why, fuck, that's not why, that's Xbox Y.

1552
03:43:28,700 --> 03:43:45,750
I just pressed the up button, the top one.

1553
03:43:45,750 --> 03:44:03,709
I get it, it changed the layout.

1554
03:44:03,709 --> 03:44:05,149
I feel like I would do the reverse problem.

1555
03:44:05,149 --> 03:44:06,110
I would start overthinking it

1556
03:44:06,110 --> 03:44:08,790
and try to hit buttons that were,

1557
03:44:08,790 --> 03:44:21,739
it says X on screen, I'll press the right one that time.

1558
03:44:21,780 --> 03:44:37,620
60 seconds, wait till it gets ported to PC.

1559
03:44:39,899 --> 03:44:56,579
Nobody tell them, nobody's gonna tell them.

1560
03:44:56,579 --> 03:45:06,350
Just emulate it with a switch emulator.

1561
03:45:06,350 --> 03:45:18,250
I don't think that makes it, I don't think those exist.

1562
03:45:18,250 --> 03:45:19,809
The thing is, I don't think I would ever emulate anything

1563
03:45:19,809 --> 03:45:24,940
on the current gen because it's available to just play.

1564
03:45:24,940 --> 03:45:30,370
The problem with emulate, oh my God, I have nine seconds left.

1565
03:45:30,370 --> 03:45:34,299
I don't know where it is, it's right there.

1566
03:45:34,299 --> 03:45:38,250
Ah, I have 0.4 seconds to press A.

1567
03:45:38,370 --> 03:45:41,530
Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1568
03:45:41,530 --> 03:45:43,760
Did I get it?

1569
03:45:43,760 --> 03:45:54,069
Got it.

1570
03:45:54,069 --> 03:45:55,030
What was I saying?

1571
03:45:56,379 --> 03:45:57,579
Oh, right, right, right.

1572
03:45:57,579 --> 03:46:01,100
So the reason why emulation is something

1573
03:46:01,100 --> 03:46:03,540
that I have done in the past, right,

1574
03:46:03,540 --> 03:46:08,209
is because sometimes you just can't get access to anything.

1575
03:46:08,209 --> 03:46:10,450
Even when I play a game from like 20 years ago

1576
03:46:10,450 --> 03:46:13,360
that is never gonna get released ever again,

1577
03:46:13,360 --> 03:46:15,479
that you may even have in a closet,

1578
03:46:15,479 --> 03:46:19,690
up in your attic or whatever.

1579
03:46:19,690 --> 03:46:24,940
It's just, it's impossible to ever do it again.

1580
03:46:24,940 --> 03:46:27,059
And like, I'm gonna, okay, I'm gonna take a shot

1581
03:46:28,059 --> 03:46:30,260
at Nintendo here.

1582
03:46:30,260 --> 03:46:32,899
You don't solve that problem by releasing

1583
03:46:32,899 --> 03:46:34,979
like one Super Nintendo game a week

1584
03:46:34,979 --> 03:46:39,469
that nobody gives a shit about on like the Switch Online.

1585
03:46:39,469 --> 03:46:42,069
Like, oh, new Super Nintendo games available.

1586
03:46:42,069 --> 03:46:45,389
It's like one or two, it's like every like week or two.

1587
03:46:45,389 --> 03:46:50,239
Not even, sometimes it's like once a month.

1588
03:46:50,239 --> 03:46:52,719
It's like you, like I would actually pay for this.

1589
03:46:52,719 --> 03:46:55,309
I really would.

1590
03:46:55,309 --> 03:46:56,790
And I understand like, oh, but we don't want to just

1591
03:46:56,790 --> 03:46:57,950
dump everything on.

1592
03:46:57,950 --> 03:47:01,469
I would pay a very hefty, more than like Netflix fee.

1593
03:47:02,030 --> 03:47:05,329
I would pay a Netflix style fee

1594
03:47:05,329 --> 03:47:07,489
if they just dumped whatever they were able

1595
03:47:07,489 --> 03:47:11,270
to actually license still.

1596
03:47:11,270 --> 03:47:12,110
Just give us everything.

1597
03:47:12,110 --> 03:47:15,030
I'll pay a monthly fee for it.

1598
03:47:15,030 --> 03:47:20,780
I want to play the games and I will pay for it.

1599
03:47:20,780 --> 03:47:25,899
But like, well, there's like 31 games on the Switch Online

1600
03:47:25,899 --> 03:47:30,389
and you know, maybe we'll, maybe you'll get like Rygar.

1601
03:47:30,389 --> 03:47:36,100
Okay, yeah, I guess.

1602
03:47:36,100 --> 03:47:37,459
I don't want to rent, I want to own.

1603
03:47:37,459 --> 03:47:39,639
I will pay for these games.

1604
03:47:39,639 --> 03:47:41,120
Yeah, they had the virtual console

1605
03:47:41,120 --> 03:47:42,280
and everybody like loved it.

1606
03:47:42,280 --> 03:47:44,079
And then there was probably some licensing problem

1607
03:47:44,079 --> 03:47:45,079
to bring it over, right?

1608
03:47:45,079 --> 03:47:50,280
But still, I would pay more than what I pay for Netflix.

1609
03:47:50,280 --> 03:47:51,479
They have access to like every

1610
03:47:51,479 --> 03:47:54,399
available licensed regular Nintendo game.

1611
03:47:54,399 --> 03:47:55,799
And they wonder why people like emulate it.

1612
03:47:55,799 --> 03:47:59,069
That's the why, is they want to play.

1613
03:47:59,069 --> 03:48:00,909
You talk, look at the younger audience, right?

1614
03:48:00,909 --> 03:48:02,920
The younger kids.

1615
03:48:02,920 --> 03:48:05,110
They hear all these stories.

1616
03:48:05,110 --> 03:48:06,430
Oh my God, you have no idea.

1617
03:48:06,430 --> 03:48:09,350
Super Mario One, Super Mario Two, Super Mario Three.

1618
03:48:09,350 --> 03:48:12,430
No, you didn't play, you didn't play Unicycle.

1619
03:48:12,430 --> 03:48:13,389
That game was amazing.

1620
03:48:13,629 --> 03:48:15,790
The Unicycle racing game for the Super Nintendo.

1621
03:48:15,790 --> 03:48:19,250
You idiot Zoomer, you have no idea how good it was.

1622
03:48:19,250 --> 03:48:20,969
I want to play.

1623
03:48:20,969 --> 03:48:23,500
Oh, you're never going to get a chance.

1624
03:48:23,500 --> 03:48:29,530
Like they want to have those experiences.

1625
03:48:29,530 --> 03:48:31,250
Dude, I remember Clay Fighter.

1626
03:48:31,250 --> 03:48:32,809
Yeah, me and my like 30 year old buddy

1627
03:48:32,809 --> 03:48:33,969
are talking about Clay Fighter.

1628
03:48:33,969 --> 03:48:35,610
Oh, Frosty the Snowman, it was awesome.

1629
03:48:35,610 --> 03:48:38,090
Purr, purr, purr, hurt, hurt, hurt.

1630
03:48:38,090 --> 03:48:40,489
Oh, I loved, Taffy, it was awesome.

1631
03:48:40,489 --> 03:48:42,889
Was that this guy that, this kid's like 19

1632
03:48:42,889 --> 03:48:44,489
where you didn't play it?

1633
03:48:44,489 --> 03:48:45,770
Good luck, idiot.

1634
03:48:45,770 --> 03:48:46,930
We loved it, we played it.

1635
03:48:46,930 --> 03:48:49,319
Don't you wish you had an experience like us?

1636
03:48:49,959 --> 03:48:50,799
They kind of do, they want to play it.

1637
03:48:50,799 --> 03:48:54,510
They would love to do it.

1638
03:48:54,510 --> 03:48:57,569
So like they have to find a way to play it, right?

1639
03:48:57,569 --> 03:49:11,409
It's not rocket science.

1640
03:49:11,409 --> 03:49:13,450
And I don't know, but like punishing like,

1641
03:49:13,450 --> 03:49:17,770
I don't have like a reason to go get Clay Fighter

1642
03:49:17,770 --> 03:49:18,770
for the Super Nintendo.

1643
03:49:18,770 --> 03:49:22,950
Like I don't, or like Clay Fighter 63 and third, whatever.

1644
03:49:22,950 --> 03:49:24,030
So I already experienced that.

1645
03:49:24,030 --> 03:49:26,489
I played it a shitload when I was younger.

1646
03:49:26,489 --> 03:49:27,729
And if we're going to hold these games

1647
03:49:27,729 --> 03:49:31,250
to this like really high, almost like gatekeep standard

1648
03:49:32,129 --> 03:49:35,420
to like the younger gamers,

1649
03:49:35,459 --> 03:49:37,260
they should be able to play it.

1650
03:49:37,260 --> 03:49:38,540
They should have an opportunity to play it

1651
03:49:38,540 --> 03:49:49,780
without having it being illegal.

1652
03:49:49,780 --> 03:49:57,450
That's just what I think.

1653
03:49:57,450 --> 03:49:59,530
Why is it being illegal stopping you?

1654
03:49:59,530 --> 03:50:02,530
Well, I'm not saying it is, but the fact that like you,

1655
03:50:02,530 --> 03:50:07,030
look, going and getting like an emulator

1656
03:50:07,030 --> 03:50:09,270
and downloading ROMs and shit,

1657
03:50:09,270 --> 03:50:10,989
it's like you'd nobody, people like actually kind of

1658
03:50:10,989 --> 03:50:13,229
don't really want to do that.

1659
03:50:13,229 --> 03:50:14,069
Like a young audience.

1660
03:50:14,069 --> 03:50:17,149
Like if you're talking, like when I was like 13, 14, 15,

1661
03:50:17,149 --> 03:50:17,989
oh, what you got to do, you got to go

1662
03:50:17,989 --> 03:50:18,829
with this piece of software.

1663
03:50:18,829 --> 03:50:19,950
You got to go get this ROM.

1664
03:50:19,950 --> 03:50:20,950
You got to drag the ROM into here.

1665
03:50:20,950 --> 03:50:21,950
By the way, hit escape.

1666
03:50:21,950 --> 03:50:22,790
And you have to do a configure

1667
03:50:22,790 --> 03:50:24,270
a bunch of fucked up video settings.

1668
03:50:24,270 --> 03:50:25,950
And oh, by the way, maybe the ROM doesn't work.

1669
03:50:25,950 --> 03:50:28,510
Oh, maybe, but I can't feel like viruses and shit.

1670
03:50:28,510 --> 03:50:36,239
It's like, it's just, it's just troublesome.

1671
03:50:36,239 --> 03:50:37,559
It's not the same experience.

1672
03:50:37,559 --> 03:50:41,569
Yeah, and look, I am forever grateful

1673
03:50:41,569 --> 03:50:44,250
to the people that were able to kind of archive

1674
03:50:44,250 --> 03:50:47,579
a lot of this stuff.

1675
03:50:47,579 --> 03:50:48,659
Because without emulation,

1676
03:50:48,659 --> 03:50:51,139
without people doing ROMs and emulation,

1677
03:50:51,139 --> 03:50:52,540
and having to be like a real passionate thing

1678
03:50:52,540 --> 03:50:54,219
that people did, we probably wouldn't be able

1679
03:50:54,219 --> 03:50:57,360
to even have half of these things.

1680
03:50:57,360 --> 03:50:58,559
We wouldn't be able to even care

1681
03:50:58,559 --> 03:51:05,819
about half of these franchises, I don't think.

1682
03:51:05,819 --> 03:51:07,180
All right, what do I need?

1683
03:51:07,180 --> 03:51:10,139
Get C rank or higher in one defense mission.

1684
03:51:10,139 --> 03:51:10,979
I did it already.

1685
03:51:10,979 --> 03:51:13,379
Otaku Freak is the name of this item.

1686
03:51:16,299 --> 03:51:29,649
I guess I'll put it on, okay.

1687
03:51:29,649 --> 03:51:31,809
But here's the thing, I'm also not naive enough

1688
03:51:31,809 --> 03:51:36,290
to say that, oh, just put all 700 Super Nintendo games

1689
03:51:36,290 --> 03:51:40,579
up on the Super Nintendo online Switch thing.

1690
03:51:40,579 --> 03:51:42,579
Like there's licensing deals.

1691
03:51:42,579 --> 03:51:44,219
There's like music that probably was

1692
03:51:44,219 --> 03:51:45,700
in some of those games that they can never

1693
03:51:45,700 --> 03:51:47,579
like actually release ever again.

1694
03:51:48,459 --> 03:51:51,459
I do, but it'd be nice to see like a real actual effort

1695
03:51:51,459 --> 03:52:04,610
to really put on a bunch of stuff that they can put on.

1696
03:52:04,610 --> 03:52:08,610
Like Super Mario RPG can't be released easily again.

1697
03:52:08,610 --> 03:52:20,530
Right, isn't that a huge reason why we're never gonna see

1698
03:52:20,530 --> 03:52:23,159
Turtles in Time?

1699
03:52:23,159 --> 03:52:28,159
Probably, but who stands, I hate, okay, here we go.

1700
03:52:28,479 --> 03:52:29,879
You ready?

1701
03:52:29,879 --> 03:52:33,440
Who stands to gain from that?

1702
03:52:33,440 --> 03:52:35,760
They're not selling copies of Turtles in Time

1703
03:52:35,760 --> 03:52:38,520
really anymore, they remade it, right?

1704
03:52:38,520 --> 03:52:40,719
Didn't they like redo like Turtles in Time

1705
03:52:40,719 --> 03:52:42,680
or like a version of it?

1706
03:52:42,680 --> 03:52:43,680
They made like a new beat-em-up

1707
03:52:43,680 --> 03:52:45,440
like five or six years ago, right?

1708
03:52:47,020 --> 03:52:48,540
They're not selling Turtles in Time anymore.

1709
03:52:48,540 --> 03:52:51,659
Like, I don't know, I just don't understand why.

1710
03:52:51,659 --> 03:52:53,260
It's such an awesome piece of media

1711
03:52:53,260 --> 03:52:55,940
that people should be able to enjoy.

1712
03:52:55,940 --> 03:52:57,159
And even if they were to get it together

1713
03:52:57,159 --> 03:52:59,459
and like charge for it again, like a few bucks or something,

1714
03:52:59,459 --> 03:53:01,219
whatever, that's fine.

1715
03:53:01,219 --> 03:53:03,600
But just to like delete this shit from all history

1716
03:53:03,600 --> 03:53:06,059
and say, don't ever look at it ever again.

1717
03:53:06,059 --> 03:53:06,899
Don't look at it.

1718
03:53:06,899 --> 03:53:09,770
If you look at it, then it's illegal.

1719
03:53:09,850 --> 03:53:11,049
But like, I mean, it was awesome.

1720
03:53:11,049 --> 03:53:16,719
I like wanna look at it.

1721
03:53:16,719 --> 03:53:20,930
You can't like, okay, you can't like have the Picasso

1722
03:53:20,930 --> 03:53:24,600
be a painting that existed.

1723
03:53:24,600 --> 03:53:26,780
And then you like put the Picasso behind a fucking,

1724
03:53:26,780 --> 03:53:29,270
like a black screen,

1725
03:53:29,270 --> 03:53:35,840
just because it's fucking like more than 100 years old.

1726
03:53:35,840 --> 03:53:38,639
Well, you see, oh, I wanna come see,

1727
03:53:38,639 --> 03:53:41,040
I wanna come see all Picasso's paintings.

1728
03:53:41,040 --> 03:53:44,030
Well, see, there's an issue there.

1729
03:53:44,030 --> 03:53:46,899
You can't look at them anymore.

1730
03:53:46,899 --> 03:53:48,299
Why not?

1731
03:53:48,299 --> 03:53:50,840
Well, because it's been a pretty long time

1732
03:53:50,840 --> 03:53:52,520
and we just kinda don't feel like

1733
03:53:52,520 --> 03:53:55,180
showing it to anybody anymore.

1734
03:53:55,180 --> 03:53:56,280
So what about, can I,

1735
03:53:56,280 --> 03:54:00,379
but there's images of Picasso's paintings online.

1736
03:54:00,379 --> 03:54:03,590
You look at them, you're going to fucking jail.

1737
03:54:03,590 --> 03:54:06,860
Okay, thanks.

1738
03:54:06,860 --> 03:54:08,639
Appreciate, I guess I get,

1739
03:54:08,639 --> 03:54:11,420
my like older, like 35 year old boomer friend

1740
03:54:11,420 --> 03:54:25,260
will tell me how cool they were.

1741
03:54:25,260 --> 03:54:34,379
All right, I'll rant over.

1742
03:54:34,379 --> 03:54:35,959
Don't give him any ideas.

1743
03:54:35,959 --> 03:54:38,510
All right, what am I actually supposed to be doing right now?

1744
03:54:38,510 --> 03:54:40,069
I've lost all control of the stream.

1745
03:54:40,069 --> 03:54:41,370
What was I doing?

1746
03:54:41,370 --> 03:54:46,370
Okay, ATM, I gotta make 25,000 utopia coins.

1747
03:54:47,649 --> 03:54:52,000
So let's go do a mission.

1748
03:54:52,000 --> 03:54:53,479
Get on the highway and head to the thunder dome.

1749
03:54:53,479 --> 03:55:07,200
Okay, friends with 35 guy,

1750
03:55:07,200 --> 03:55:09,399
friends with older 35 year old.

1751
03:55:09,399 --> 03:55:12,309
No, I'm just saying, like,

1752
03:55:12,309 --> 03:55:14,250
you get to watch like YouTube videos

1753
03:55:14,250 --> 03:55:17,049
of dickheads like me telling you,

1754
03:55:17,049 --> 03:55:22,950
oh my God, and it was the coolest thing ever.

1755
03:55:22,950 --> 03:55:25,430
It was the best experience ever.

1756
03:55:25,430 --> 03:55:32,829
It was so fun.

1757
03:55:32,870 --> 03:55:55,420
I said rant over, I know.

1758
03:55:55,420 --> 03:56:02,059
I love the weekly rants, keep it up.

1759
03:56:02,059 --> 03:56:10,139
Ooh, something right here.

1760
03:56:10,139 --> 03:56:12,319
Where is it?

1761
03:56:12,319 --> 03:56:20,040
ATM, wait, where's the, there it is.

1762
03:56:20,040 --> 03:56:20,959
Oh, it's the rant.

1763
03:56:21,959 --> 03:56:24,180
I can't say that.

1764
03:56:24,180 --> 03:56:25,020
Those are facts.

1765
03:56:25,020 --> 03:56:25,979
Oh, there's Twitch here.

1766
03:56:25,979 --> 03:56:26,819
Twitch dev, what's going on?

1767
03:56:26,819 --> 03:56:32,139
Hello.

1768
03:56:32,139 --> 03:56:33,860
Wesson mining is dangerous and can prove fatal.

1769
03:56:33,860 --> 03:56:35,540
No one ever returns.

1770
03:56:35,540 --> 03:56:36,819
I'd like to test out your true fortitude.

1771
03:56:36,819 --> 03:56:40,270
Could you please take over Wesson mining in the cave?

1772
03:56:40,270 --> 03:56:55,059
All right, mining, it's Bonzi buddy.

1773
03:56:55,059 --> 03:56:57,120
It is.

1774
03:56:57,120 --> 03:56:59,000
Okay, dig up Wesson before the time runs out.

1775
03:56:59,000 --> 03:57:02,299
Just swing the pickaxe, run around in mine.

1776
03:57:13,379 --> 03:57:14,219
Did I get it?

1777
03:57:14,219 --> 03:57:16,159
I got it, okay, go.

1778
03:57:16,159 --> 03:57:17,000
Shut up.

1779
03:57:23,079 --> 03:57:25,340
Okay, I got to count how many times it takes to do it.

1780
03:57:27,860 --> 03:57:28,700
It's lava.

1781
03:57:31,200 --> 03:57:32,780
Like, can I go over here?

1782
03:57:32,780 --> 03:57:33,620
No, where is it?

1783
03:57:33,620 --> 03:57:34,760
Is that it?

1784
03:57:34,760 --> 03:57:35,760
It's two out of two.

1785
03:57:35,760 --> 03:57:38,540
How do I leave?

1786
03:57:38,540 --> 03:57:39,379
Is that it?

1787
03:57:48,159 --> 03:57:49,000
Yeah!

1788
03:57:49,000 --> 03:58:02,219
Tutorial, oh, okay, okay.

1789
03:58:02,219 --> 03:58:05,620
I heard you talk shit about Nintendo.

1790
03:58:05,620 --> 03:58:08,219
I'm not talking shit about Nintendo.

1791
03:58:08,219 --> 03:58:13,579
I'm just bringing up a point.

1792
03:58:13,579 --> 03:58:17,790
I'm playing on a Nintendo console right now.

1793
03:58:17,790 --> 03:58:19,709
But here's another part two to this.

1794
03:58:19,709 --> 03:58:21,989
This is a really important part two.

1795
03:58:21,989 --> 03:58:23,149
I think we don't think too much

1796
03:58:23,149 --> 03:58:26,270
about this particular part two.

1797
03:58:26,270 --> 03:58:29,979
What happens in another 50 years, 100 years?

1798
03:58:29,979 --> 03:58:33,819
What happens in 30 years when like 10 more consoles are out?

1799
03:58:33,819 --> 03:58:35,059
Does this all just disappear,

1800
03:58:35,059 --> 03:58:37,680
all this shit that we've done?

1801
03:58:37,680 --> 03:58:41,250
We have to like preserve this stuff,

1802
03:58:41,250 --> 03:58:45,260
otherwise it just goes away.

1803
03:58:53,540 --> 03:58:54,819
Dude, there are people that like,

1804
03:58:54,819 --> 03:58:57,299
they turn off like the servers to play games sometimes.

1805
03:58:57,299 --> 03:59:00,500
Like all these, that's like the big proponents against

1806
03:59:00,500 --> 03:59:06,409
always online games, right?

1807
03:59:06,409 --> 03:59:16,420
What happened?

1808
03:59:16,420 --> 03:59:17,540
Well, let's try that again.

1809
03:59:17,540 --> 03:59:27,340
You can fall in the lava.

1810
03:59:27,340 --> 03:59:29,180
Look at the seal video.

1811
03:59:29,180 --> 03:59:33,430
No, no, I refuse.

1812
03:59:37,000 --> 03:59:39,489
You mined straight down.

1813
03:59:39,489 --> 03:59:40,610
Yeah, kind of.

1814
03:59:40,610 --> 03:59:42,090
All right, well, I'm gonna go this way.

1815
03:59:49,739 --> 03:59:56,840
Watch out for the fire.

1816
03:59:56,840 --> 03:59:57,680
What happened?

1817
03:59:57,680 --> 03:59:59,239
I have to fight enemies in here too?

1818
03:59:59,239 --> 04:00:00,239
What the fuck?

1819
04:00:03,069 --> 04:00:04,069
I'm so confused.

1820
04:00:29,270 --> 04:00:36,750
Grab.

1821
04:00:38,629 --> 04:00:41,840
I gotta remember how to get the hell out of here.

1822
04:00:45,479 --> 04:00:46,319
This is two.

1823
04:00:46,319 --> 04:00:49,440
Two heavy hits and that's it.

1824
04:00:49,440 --> 04:00:50,760
Seven, two out of seven.

1825
04:00:56,450 --> 04:00:57,889
This is gonna be my least favorite one.

1826
04:00:57,889 --> 04:01:00,479
I'm gonna get so lost here.

1827
04:01:00,479 --> 04:01:01,319
Aye, aye, aye.

1828
04:01:04,680 --> 04:01:06,239
Get it.

1829
04:01:06,239 --> 04:01:15,340
Oh my fucking God, this sucks.

1830
04:01:15,340 --> 04:01:21,899
Same exact place.

1831
04:01:21,899 --> 04:01:22,739
I'm gonna try this one more time,

1832
04:01:22,739 --> 04:01:24,790
then I don't even care.

1833
04:01:24,790 --> 04:01:25,829
This is level one.

1834
04:01:38,719 --> 04:01:39,559
Okay.

1835
04:01:45,370 --> 04:01:46,290
I'm gonna go left.

1836
04:01:46,290 --> 04:01:47,729
Wait for this fire to go.

1837
04:01:47,729 --> 04:01:48,569
I can jump.

1838
04:01:49,049 --> 04:01:50,809
I just jumped in the, whatever.

1839
04:01:50,809 --> 04:01:51,770
You all saw what happened.

1840
04:01:51,770 --> 04:01:53,450
I don't need to tell you what happened.

1841
04:02:02,770 --> 04:02:03,690
These missions are tough

1842
04:02:03,690 --> 04:02:07,790
because they have to actually fight them too.

1843
04:02:07,790 --> 04:02:08,629
I don't know where I am,

1844
04:02:08,629 --> 04:02:09,469
but I apparently...

1845
04:02:19,739 --> 04:02:20,579
No.

1846
04:02:26,159 --> 04:02:28,079
Pretty good dodges in this fight corridor though,

1847
04:02:28,079 --> 04:02:28,920
I will say.

1848
04:02:32,780 --> 04:02:34,340
No seal, no meal.

1849
04:02:34,340 --> 04:02:35,700
I'll show the video again.

1850
04:02:35,700 --> 04:02:36,940
I'll play it again.

1851
04:02:36,940 --> 04:02:43,819
Get the fuck out.

1852
04:02:43,819 --> 04:02:44,659
And dig.

1853
04:02:44,860 --> 04:02:46,700
How are you?

1854
04:02:46,700 --> 04:02:52,489
It's two heavy, one normal.

1855
04:02:52,489 --> 04:02:59,129
It's two heavy.

1856
04:02:59,129 --> 04:03:00,129
What the fuck?

1857
04:03:09,200 --> 04:03:13,329
Gonna explode and...

1858
04:03:13,329 --> 04:03:15,750
Shut up.

1859
04:03:15,750 --> 04:03:18,030
I'm gonna see, is it three swings maybe?

1860
04:03:18,030 --> 04:03:19,989
Three normal swings and then one.

1861
04:03:19,989 --> 04:03:25,379
I gotta get a good rhythm here.

1862
04:03:25,379 --> 04:03:27,340
It might be one, two, three, three.

1863
04:03:33,059 --> 04:03:34,020
Seal, seal.

1864
04:03:34,020 --> 04:03:34,860
Stop.

1865
04:03:34,860 --> 04:03:36,620
I'll show the seal in like 10 minutes.

1866
04:03:48,989 --> 04:03:50,229
Invincible mode.

1867
04:03:50,229 --> 04:03:51,069
Ooh.

1868
04:03:52,870 --> 04:04:10,379
What's wrong?

1869
04:04:10,379 --> 04:04:12,420
It's gonna be one, two, let's see.

1870
04:04:14,219 --> 04:04:15,059
One, two, three.

1871
04:04:16,860 --> 04:04:18,739
Let's do, two, let's do three.

1872
04:04:18,739 --> 04:04:20,260
Let's do four.

1873
04:04:20,260 --> 04:04:22,739
One, two, three, four.

1874
04:04:22,739 --> 04:04:24,180
Nope, that's a bad strategy.

1875
04:04:25,510 --> 04:04:27,860
We'll do one and then two heavy.

1876
04:04:27,860 --> 04:04:28,899
There's only three more.

1877
04:04:28,899 --> 04:04:33,340
Take it slow, don't be a fucking idiot.

1878
04:04:33,340 --> 04:04:35,899
I'm probably not gone.

1879
04:04:35,899 --> 04:04:37,420
Went down there.

1880
04:04:37,420 --> 04:04:40,059
Haven't gone this way.

1881
04:04:40,059 --> 04:04:41,020
I did go this way though.

1882
04:04:41,020 --> 04:04:47,690
No, not all the way.

1883
04:04:47,690 --> 04:04:48,729
Hey, don't be stupid.

1884
04:04:48,850 --> 04:04:50,170
It's up there.

1885
04:04:50,170 --> 04:04:51,530
What about this way?

1886
04:04:51,530 --> 04:04:52,370
One up there.

1887
04:04:59,540 --> 04:05:06,000
Two more.

1888
04:05:06,000 --> 04:05:07,200
Where's this last one?

1889
04:05:12,030 --> 04:05:13,430
Where's the last one?

1890
04:05:26,270 --> 04:05:27,469
Come on.

1891
04:05:27,469 --> 04:05:28,309
Where is it?

1892
04:05:35,590 --> 04:05:36,829
I gotta leave.

1893
04:05:36,829 --> 04:05:37,670
There's the exit.

1894
04:05:37,670 --> 04:05:38,510
Can I jump?

1895
04:05:38,510 --> 04:05:50,709
Can I make this jump?

1896
04:05:50,709 --> 04:05:51,629
How many noises today?

1897
04:05:51,629 --> 04:06:01,239
Yeah, you're getting a lot of slurps tonight.

1898
04:06:02,440 --> 04:06:11,260
That's for sure.

1899
04:06:11,260 --> 04:06:12,700
All right, 25,000, right?

1900
04:06:12,700 --> 04:06:15,899
I still have to do those missions before the boss.

1901
04:06:15,899 --> 04:06:22,739
So, probably should get over there and start doing this.

1902
04:06:22,739 --> 04:06:34,600
There's actually one over here.

1903
04:06:34,600 --> 04:06:35,440
Seal time.

1904
04:06:35,440 --> 04:06:48,579
Yes, it is.

1905
04:06:48,579 --> 04:06:51,100
Here you go.

1906
04:06:51,100 --> 04:07:00,059
Here's the seal video.

1907
04:07:00,059 --> 04:07:05,059
Five, four, 19, 84, 10, 47, 10, 47.

1908
04:07:21,389 --> 04:07:22,229
Hey, hey.

1909
04:07:37,149 --> 04:07:44,139
This actually might be,

1910
04:07:44,139 --> 04:07:47,139
this actually might be the best video ever

1911
04:07:47,139 --> 04:07:48,600
I've ever seen.

1912
04:07:48,600 --> 04:07:51,420
It's pretty high up there, I think.

1913
04:07:51,420 --> 04:07:52,260
I think it is.

1914
04:07:59,659 --> 04:08:00,620
We can't see?

1915
04:08:00,620 --> 04:08:04,440
Oh, well, you'll just take,

1916
04:08:04,440 --> 04:08:10,149
I can't put it up right this second.

1917
04:08:10,149 --> 04:08:13,200
It's on the subreddit.

1918
04:08:13,200 --> 04:08:19,180
RGerman985 is there.

1919
04:08:19,180 --> 04:08:20,940
If one of the parasites shot up from its mouth

1920
04:08:20,940 --> 04:08:23,770
lashes onto you, you'll be rendered immobile.

1921
04:08:23,770 --> 04:08:26,709
Watch out for the parasite face attack.

1922
04:08:26,709 --> 04:08:28,309
I'm pretty sure I've fought this dude in the tutorial,

1923
04:08:28,309 --> 04:08:29,149
right?

1924
04:08:29,149 --> 04:08:29,989
Okay, bring it on for real this time.

1925
04:08:29,989 --> 04:08:35,629
Show me what you got.

1926
04:08:35,629 --> 04:08:36,549
Get ready.

1927
04:08:43,239 --> 04:08:44,680
Okay, it moves really slowly.

1928
04:08:46,420 --> 04:08:47,979
Because you can't even touch it.

1929
04:08:47,979 --> 04:08:52,979
But I thought it was like a pistol or something.

1930
04:08:52,979 --> 04:08:53,819
Here are the ads.

1931
04:09:07,180 --> 04:09:17,030
All right, let's go.

1932
04:09:17,030 --> 04:09:17,850
What?

1933
04:09:17,850 --> 04:09:25,909
I was in super mode.

1934
04:09:29,139 --> 04:09:31,180
Heavy attacks only, Jeremy.

1935
04:09:43,500 --> 04:09:45,110
Doubt.

1936
04:09:45,110 --> 04:09:53,500
Yeah, this guy is a pain in the ass, isn't he?

1937
04:09:53,500 --> 04:09:54,780
Can I get rid of those?

1938
04:09:54,780 --> 04:09:57,219
Is there any way I can actually kill those things?

1939
04:10:10,739 --> 04:10:11,579
Good toss.

1940
04:10:13,819 --> 04:10:15,840
Again, grab.

1941
04:10:15,840 --> 04:10:32,379
Oh, it didn't work.

1942
04:10:32,379 --> 04:10:33,219
What's that?

1943
04:10:33,219 --> 04:10:34,040
What's that?

1944
04:10:34,040 --> 04:10:34,879
What's that?

1945
04:10:34,879 --> 04:10:38,219
Oh my goodness, that hurt.

1946
04:10:38,219 --> 04:10:39,059
I want to dodge.

1947
04:10:39,059 --> 04:10:39,879
Stop swinging too much.

1948
04:10:39,879 --> 04:10:40,719
You're being greedy.

1949
04:10:40,719 --> 04:10:43,000
Stop it.

1950
04:10:43,000 --> 04:10:46,209
Wait for an opportunity.

1951
04:10:46,209 --> 04:10:47,489
Stop it.

1952
04:10:47,489 --> 04:10:48,649
I have to relax today.

1953
04:10:50,370 --> 04:10:51,209
Here we go.

1954
04:11:13,129 --> 04:11:13,969
Here comes a C rank.

1955
04:11:13,969 --> 04:11:20,110
Yeah, whatever.

1956
04:11:20,110 --> 04:11:22,079
Dodge when it's purple.

1957
04:11:22,079 --> 04:11:23,760
Hey man, it's either just easier said than done though.

1958
04:11:23,760 --> 04:11:27,489
You get like a 10th of a second to make that decision.

1959
04:11:27,489 --> 04:11:50,659
Just be happy they're not Ds.

1960
04:11:50,659 --> 04:11:52,459
Ds what?

1961
04:11:52,459 --> 04:11:54,629
You know.

1962
04:11:56,739 --> 04:11:57,579
There's another one.

1963
04:11:57,579 --> 04:11:58,399
There's another mat.

1964
04:11:58,399 --> 04:12:00,219
There's something right here.

1965
04:12:00,219 --> 04:12:09,579
I'm kind of standing right on top of whatever this is.

1966
04:12:09,579 --> 04:12:16,229
What is it?

1967
04:12:16,229 --> 04:12:17,989
Number 33, take on the defense mission.

1968
04:12:17,989 --> 04:12:28,239
Two waves, yes.

1969
04:12:28,239 --> 04:12:31,250
Are you going to do another royalty free movie night?

1970
04:12:31,250 --> 04:12:32,090
I thought about it,

1971
04:12:32,090 --> 04:12:40,059
but I feel like we've watched the good ones.

1972
04:12:40,059 --> 04:12:41,219
It's two of these Katana guys.

1973
04:12:41,219 --> 04:12:43,219
All right, let's do this right off the bat.

1974
04:12:55,239 --> 04:13:03,459
And get it from behind.

1975
04:13:03,459 --> 04:13:10,360
Grab it.

1976
04:13:10,360 --> 04:13:21,909
Ooh, nice.

1977
04:13:21,909 --> 04:13:24,250
Recommend the second game.

1978
04:13:24,250 --> 04:13:27,420
Um, hold on.

1979
04:13:27,420 --> 04:13:35,120
Can't talk right now.

1980
04:13:35,120 --> 04:13:48,549
Hold on.

1981
04:13:48,549 --> 04:13:49,389
Come here.

1982
04:13:57,200 --> 04:13:58,639
Can't talk while he's focused.

1983
04:13:58,639 --> 04:14:00,239
No, not at all.

1984
04:14:00,239 --> 04:14:02,559
My brain can only focus on one thing at a time.

1985
04:14:02,559 --> 04:14:17,700
Only one, nothing more.

1986
04:14:17,700 --> 04:14:19,420
That should be a B at least, right?

1987
04:14:19,420 --> 04:14:22,319
That's a B.

1988
04:14:22,319 --> 04:14:23,559
That's a B.

1989
04:14:23,559 --> 04:14:24,399
I was wave two.

1990
04:14:24,399 --> 04:14:25,239
Oh my God.

1991
04:14:25,239 --> 04:14:28,020
This harder than that.

1992
04:14:28,020 --> 04:14:36,479
I forget what these guys do.

1993
04:14:36,479 --> 04:14:37,319
Oh my God.

1994
04:14:37,319 --> 04:14:42,770
I forget these guys explode.

1995
04:14:42,770 --> 04:14:46,680
I got to activate these.

1996
04:14:46,680 --> 04:14:47,520
Ow.

1997
04:14:47,520 --> 04:14:49,110
Be careful.

1998
04:14:49,110 --> 04:14:49,950
Holy shit.

1999
04:15:05,079 --> 04:15:05,920
What's my opinion on sardines?

2000
04:15:05,920 --> 04:15:18,909
Love them.

2001
04:15:18,909 --> 04:15:22,950
No.

2002
04:15:22,950 --> 04:15:24,190
Oh, come on.

2003
04:15:24,190 --> 04:15:25,069
I hate these guys.

2004
04:15:25,069 --> 04:15:32,709
I hate these teleporting bullshit enemies.

2005
04:15:32,709 --> 04:15:33,549
Ugh.

2006
04:15:51,459 --> 04:15:52,299
Oh, fuck you.

2007
04:15:58,989 --> 04:16:06,569
What?

2008
04:16:06,569 --> 04:16:07,409
Oh.

2009
04:16:14,829 --> 04:16:24,540
If that's a C, then this game is hard.

2010
04:16:24,540 --> 04:16:25,379
I may have probably,

2011
04:16:25,379 --> 04:16:29,600
I could have done that a little faster on the second phase.

2012
04:16:29,600 --> 04:16:30,959
Skill usage.

2013
04:16:30,959 --> 04:16:39,489
Another C.

2014
04:16:39,489 --> 04:16:44,420
You gotta be perfect to do that shit.

2015
04:16:44,420 --> 04:16:45,260
Okay, somebody said,

2016
04:16:45,260 --> 04:16:47,700
do you recommend the second game?

2017
04:16:47,700 --> 04:16:51,729
I would say you should play at least the first two.

2018
04:16:51,729 --> 04:16:53,489
The only reason why I didn't play Travis Strikes again

2019
04:16:53,489 --> 04:16:56,250
is because I wasn't a fan of the top-down stuff.

2020
04:16:56,250 --> 04:16:57,649
I was gonna play it before this,

2021
04:16:57,649 --> 04:17:03,069
but I heard very, very mixed things about that game.

2022
04:17:03,110 --> 04:17:04,629
And not only that,

2023
04:17:04,629 --> 04:17:06,379
it's all top-down.

2024
04:17:06,379 --> 04:17:08,500
I think there's a couple of segments that aren't.

2025
04:17:08,500 --> 04:17:35,000
But, where's this fight?

2026
04:17:35,000 --> 04:17:41,040
Oh, there it is.

2027
04:17:41,040 --> 04:17:43,069
Transform!

2028
04:17:43,069 --> 04:17:50,780
Travis Strikes again is better than two.

2029
04:17:50,780 --> 04:17:53,760
Um, I really have to give it a chance.

2030
04:17:53,760 --> 04:17:56,360
But someone actually please correct me if I'm wrong here.

2031
04:17:56,360 --> 04:17:57,719
Change bucamelia!

2032
04:17:57,719 --> 04:18:03,690
Isn't Travis Strikes again a 40-hour game?

2033
04:18:03,690 --> 04:18:04,530
I feel like these games-

2034
04:18:04,530 --> 04:18:05,450
That's huge!

2035
04:18:05,450 --> 04:18:13,219
Whoa.

2036
04:18:13,219 --> 04:18:15,459
It's like 12.

2037
04:18:15,459 --> 04:18:17,979
I guess I'm, is it just wrong?

2038
04:18:17,979 --> 04:18:20,979
Fuck no, definitely not.

2039
04:18:20,979 --> 04:18:24,139
Like 15.

2040
04:18:24,139 --> 04:18:24,979
Okay, well this isn't new.

2041
04:18:24,979 --> 04:18:26,290
This is like a boss.

2042
04:18:26,290 --> 04:18:28,209
This giant suddenly appeared in Stratosphere

2043
04:18:28,209 --> 04:18:29,489
and has grown miraculously

2044
04:18:29,489 --> 04:18:34,010
in minus 270 degrees Celsius temperatures.

2045
04:18:34,010 --> 04:18:35,370
His ice cannons are powerful enough

2046
04:18:35,370 --> 04:18:38,549
to destroy entire planets.

2047
04:18:38,549 --> 04:18:39,389
Stay calm.

2048
04:18:39,389 --> 04:18:42,500
Your eye camera sensors will scan enemies for weak points.

2049
04:18:42,500 --> 04:18:43,579
That's gonna help.

2050
04:18:43,579 --> 04:18:45,219
These super big dudes always have a core

2051
04:18:45,219 --> 04:18:46,420
serving as their weak point.

2052
04:18:46,420 --> 04:18:51,139
All right, so let's get up here.

2053
04:18:51,139 --> 04:18:54,930
Phase one.

2054
04:18:54,930 --> 04:18:55,770
Wow!

2055
04:19:05,000 --> 04:19:09,280
Okay, so I hit him in the head.

2056
04:19:09,280 --> 04:19:10,120
Ice core.

2057
04:19:15,379 --> 04:19:16,219
Okay, we're good.

2058
04:19:19,450 --> 04:19:21,709
Mouth's open.

2059
04:19:21,709 --> 04:19:22,549
Yeah.

2060
04:19:22,549 --> 04:19:23,370
All right, when his mouth opens,

2061
04:19:23,370 --> 04:19:24,209
it's like a big clam.

2062
04:19:24,209 --> 04:19:28,489
Shoot it in the ear.

2063
04:19:28,489 --> 04:19:29,329
Oof.

2064
04:19:35,090 --> 04:19:35,930
I'm gonna open.

2065
04:19:36,969 --> 04:19:45,930
I just, I didn't get it.

2066
04:19:45,930 --> 04:19:46,770
His mouth is open now.

2067
04:19:46,770 --> 04:19:47,610
Shit.

2068
04:19:47,610 --> 04:19:55,149
Oh, I messed up, I messed up, I messed up.

2069
04:19:55,149 --> 04:20:02,370
Wait until he opens his mouth.

2070
04:20:02,370 --> 04:20:03,209
Here it goes.

2071
04:20:03,209 --> 04:20:05,370
Open up.

2072
04:20:05,370 --> 04:20:09,649
Open.

2073
04:20:09,649 --> 04:20:10,489
Open.

2074
04:20:10,489 --> 04:20:17,739
That's the shit on his ears.

2075
04:20:26,239 --> 04:20:27,079
All right.

2076
04:20:27,079 --> 04:20:27,899
I'm open.

2077
04:20:27,899 --> 04:20:28,739
I'm open.

2078
04:20:28,739 --> 04:20:29,579
Lockpad.

2079
04:20:32,940 --> 04:20:41,389
Just keep saying the same thing.

2080
04:20:41,389 --> 04:20:44,600
Say anything else, Travis.

2081
04:20:44,600 --> 04:20:49,500
Open your mouth.

2082
04:20:49,500 --> 04:20:50,340
I didn't even hit him.

2083
04:20:50,340 --> 04:20:56,840
What?

2084
04:20:56,840 --> 04:20:57,680
I can hit him.

2085
04:20:57,680 --> 04:21:02,459
Oh, I guess it's, okay, whatever.

2086
04:21:02,459 --> 04:21:08,010
Stop blocking.

2087
04:21:08,010 --> 04:21:11,559
What just happened?

2088
04:21:11,559 --> 04:21:15,420
What?

2089
04:21:15,420 --> 04:21:16,700
Was I just not even paying attention

2090
04:21:16,700 --> 04:21:19,940
to my health or something?

2091
04:21:19,940 --> 04:21:25,479
Are you serious?

2092
04:21:25,479 --> 04:21:26,319
What?

2093
04:21:28,139 --> 04:21:29,639
I don't understand.

2094
04:21:29,639 --> 04:21:31,940
I just wasn't looking at my health.

2095
04:21:31,940 --> 04:21:37,760
Change Bukabilia.

2096
04:21:37,760 --> 04:21:39,040
I had literally one HP.

2097
04:21:39,040 --> 04:21:40,120
Oh, that's annoying.

2098
04:21:40,120 --> 04:21:45,120
Why was I not looking at that?

2099
04:21:45,120 --> 04:21:50,469
I don't think I even had a heal.

2100
04:21:50,469 --> 04:21:51,309
Oh shit.

2101
04:21:51,309 --> 04:21:52,590
It is over there.

2102
04:21:52,590 --> 04:21:53,750
There's so much stuff on the screen.

2103
04:21:53,750 --> 04:22:07,799
It's almost like I couldn't even pay attention to it.

2104
04:22:07,799 --> 04:22:09,729
Does it hurt?

2105
04:22:09,729 --> 04:22:15,969
No, I'm not, fuck the cannon.

2106
04:22:15,969 --> 04:22:16,809
Yeah, like fuck the cannon.

2107
04:22:16,809 --> 04:22:17,629
I'm not even gonna use the cannon.

2108
04:22:17,629 --> 04:22:21,010
Cranberry.

2109
04:22:21,010 --> 04:22:24,079
These things are just better.

2110
04:22:24,079 --> 04:22:38,090
Poisonberry.

2111
04:22:38,090 --> 04:22:47,879
Go for that gas breath.

2112
04:22:47,879 --> 04:22:52,860
Over here.

2113
04:22:52,860 --> 04:22:55,659
Special kill.

2114
04:22:55,659 --> 04:22:57,020
Watch that health.

2115
04:22:57,020 --> 04:22:57,860
Lockhead.

2116
04:22:58,860 --> 04:23:01,719
Oh, that hit.

2117
04:23:01,719 --> 04:23:02,559
God damn it.

2118
04:23:02,559 --> 04:23:03,719
It's so hard to avoid that.

2119
04:23:21,049 --> 04:23:26,840
Get away.

2120
04:23:26,840 --> 04:23:30,899
Okay, now this is where he killed me instantly last time.

2121
04:23:30,899 --> 04:23:35,829
In the hands?

2122
04:23:35,829 --> 04:23:36,829
Let's get that core.

2123
04:23:47,770 --> 04:23:50,219
Come here.

2124
04:23:50,219 --> 04:23:51,059
Oh shit.

2125
04:23:55,260 --> 04:23:56,219
Where are those things?

2126
04:23:56,219 --> 04:23:57,540
I don't wanna hit them.

2127
04:24:01,540 --> 04:24:03,500
Phase two and he's dead.

2128
04:24:03,500 --> 04:24:05,500
That's a very bad score because I died.

2129
04:24:21,459 --> 04:24:35,370
I swear he didn't say that this much when I played.

2130
04:24:35,370 --> 04:24:36,969
Yeah, I know what it is.

2131
04:24:36,969 --> 04:24:41,719
Really?

2132
04:24:41,719 --> 04:24:50,059
Interesting.

2133
04:24:50,059 --> 04:24:52,370
Because I died?

2134
04:24:52,370 --> 04:24:54,049
Yeah, how many of these would I not get to see on

2135
04:24:54,049 --> 04:24:56,090
if I knew what it was, didn't take a bunch of damage,

2136
04:24:56,090 --> 04:25:02,120
and could retry it and do it again?

2137
04:25:02,120 --> 04:25:04,159
There's two more?

2138
04:25:04,159 --> 04:25:14,780
There's actually like three more.

2139
04:25:14,780 --> 04:25:16,379
Oh, this is the toilet.

2140
04:25:16,420 --> 04:25:17,819
Let's do the toilet.

2141
04:25:17,819 --> 04:25:23,000
And this one over here.

2142
04:25:23,000 --> 04:25:26,260
This is also a, is it red?

2143
04:25:26,260 --> 04:25:28,870
This one's just regular.

2144
04:25:28,870 --> 04:25:34,879
Do the toilet first.

2145
04:25:34,879 --> 04:25:36,239
This is what Vegas looks like?

2146
04:25:36,239 --> 04:25:38,409
Kind of.

2147
04:25:38,409 --> 04:25:44,239
A lot of it.

2148
04:25:44,239 --> 04:25:45,079
What is that?

2149
04:25:48,590 --> 04:26:07,690
Why does it have a big star on it?

2150
04:26:07,690 --> 04:26:09,049
Is that what it looks like when you step over it?

2151
04:26:09,049 --> 04:26:11,409
No.

2152
04:26:11,409 --> 04:26:12,250
I don't think I've ever seen what they look like

2153
04:26:12,250 --> 04:26:13,090
on the minimap.

2154
04:26:23,110 --> 04:26:39,690
Hey, oh, my hands are shaking now.

2155
04:26:39,690 --> 04:26:55,260
Do it already.

2156
04:26:55,299 --> 04:26:56,139
My friend is watching.

2157
04:26:56,139 --> 04:26:57,340
Please say something funny.

2158
04:27:04,979 --> 04:27:21,340
No, I don't really feel like it.

2159
04:27:21,340 --> 04:27:22,500
Yeah, we've reached the part of the stream

2160
04:27:22,500 --> 04:27:26,809
where I'm just like, my back's against the chair.

2161
04:27:26,809 --> 04:27:28,649
Got my Joy-Cons here, I'm just leaning back,

2162
04:27:28,649 --> 04:27:30,489
and I'm just enjoying this video game

2163
04:27:30,489 --> 04:27:32,680
because it's a good one.

2164
04:27:32,680 --> 04:27:34,799
We've reached enjoy the game portion of the stream

2165
04:27:34,799 --> 04:27:37,040
where I'm just, my back is just here.

2166
04:27:37,040 --> 04:27:41,520
Leaning back.

2167
04:27:41,520 --> 04:27:44,129
Evolver burger.

2168
04:27:44,129 --> 04:27:48,719
I think I've done it 25 times.

2169
04:27:48,719 --> 04:27:55,459
I want to keep the other shirt.

2170
04:27:55,459 --> 04:27:56,299
How is my back doing?

2171
04:27:56,299 --> 04:28:02,420
I'm doing, I'm good.

2172
04:28:02,420 --> 04:28:05,729
What else is here?

2173
04:28:05,729 --> 04:28:07,649
The toilet, the bike, and the shirt.

2174
04:28:13,479 --> 04:28:17,000
I was actually not horrible after the dollhouse stuff,

2175
04:28:17,000 --> 04:28:18,479
which is surprising considering

2176
04:28:18,479 --> 04:28:27,209
I kind of beat the shit out of myself.

2177
04:28:27,209 --> 04:28:32,819
But yes, the reduced time sitting down

2178
04:28:32,819 --> 04:28:34,219
has absolutely helped.

2179
04:28:34,219 --> 04:28:35,500
I will be completely honest with you

2180
04:28:35,500 --> 04:28:36,899
and I'm proud of you.

2181
04:28:36,899 --> 04:28:38,780
Going back to once or twice a week

2182
04:28:38,780 --> 04:28:40,100
and not sitting down,

2183
04:28:40,100 --> 04:28:43,940
because, I mean, a couple years ago,

2184
04:28:43,940 --> 04:28:46,559
two years ago or so,

2185
04:28:46,559 --> 04:28:50,520
probably really was not doing myself any favors

2186
04:28:50,559 --> 04:28:56,379
by sitting down here for seven to 10 hours a night.

2187
04:28:56,379 --> 04:28:59,100
Because there was this part of the stream life

2188
04:28:59,100 --> 04:29:01,540
that I've had where when I first started streaming,

2189
04:29:01,540 --> 04:29:03,790
I streamed for two hours,

2190
04:29:03,790 --> 04:29:06,389
like two or three times a week.

2191
04:29:06,389 --> 04:29:08,510
And then when I made the full transition to Twitch

2192
04:29:08,510 --> 04:29:11,100
and stopped completely doing YouTube at all,

2193
04:29:11,100 --> 04:29:16,020
that I started doing seven, eight, nine hour streams.

2194
04:29:16,020 --> 04:29:18,590
Three, four, five times a week sometimes.

2195
04:29:18,590 --> 04:29:20,670
At least three or four times a week.

2196
04:29:20,670 --> 04:29:24,459
And that probably was not a good thing to do.

2197
04:29:24,500 --> 04:29:32,319
This looks hard, hold on.

2198
04:29:32,319 --> 04:29:35,120
So my body was already having these issues

2199
04:29:35,120 --> 04:29:39,049
and I was sort of making them worse, I think.

2200
04:29:39,049 --> 04:29:43,389
But ever since being able to kind of sit here

2201
04:29:43,389 --> 04:29:46,979
and stream for once or twice a week,

2202
04:29:46,979 --> 04:29:49,940
five to seven hours, four to six hours, something like that,

2203
04:29:49,940 --> 04:30:00,479
I don't have like a time limit really.

2204
04:30:00,479 --> 04:30:05,540
Hey, this jumping guy is so annoying.

2205
04:30:05,540 --> 04:30:07,139
Oh, this place sucks.

2206
04:30:07,139 --> 04:30:09,100
I don't think I have any food left.

2207
04:30:21,180 --> 04:30:22,020
There he is.

2208
04:30:22,020 --> 04:30:25,959
All right, take care of him.

2209
04:30:25,959 --> 04:30:27,200
Ooh, Mustang mode.

2210
04:30:27,200 --> 04:30:30,620
Mustang, Mustang, Mustang mode.

2211
04:30:30,620 --> 04:30:48,120
That's what Mustang mode is, okay, good.

2212
04:30:48,120 --> 04:30:50,319
You say you're gonna get a standing desk?

2213
04:30:50,319 --> 04:30:53,040
Yeah, and so here's the thing though.

2214
04:30:53,040 --> 04:30:55,549
It's stationary.

2215
04:30:55,549 --> 04:30:58,579
The more that I am stationary, the worse it is.

2216
04:30:58,579 --> 04:31:03,049
So even with a standing desk, standing in the same spot

2217
04:31:03,049 --> 04:31:18,649
is essentially the same thing.

2218
04:31:18,649 --> 04:31:24,010
Make a treadmill, get a treadmill desk?

2219
04:31:24,010 --> 04:31:25,489
No, that's not gonna happen.

2220
04:31:25,489 --> 04:31:28,479
I'll be winded in 10 minutes.

2221
04:31:28,479 --> 04:31:30,479
All right, now I have enough, I can do the ATM

2222
04:31:30,479 --> 04:31:36,819
and start the next fight.

2223
04:31:36,819 --> 04:31:40,340
I think you'll bill one halo

2224
04:31:40,340 --> 04:31:47,309
for the five community subs, appreciate it.

2225
04:31:47,309 --> 04:31:49,510
But it's not been bad lately.

2226
04:31:53,190 --> 04:31:55,549
There was a few times on stream where you probably saw

2227
04:31:55,549 --> 04:31:58,610
like when the face cam was on or not.

2228
04:31:58,610 --> 04:32:00,809
You can always tell when I'm really uncomfortable,

2229
04:32:00,809 --> 04:32:04,500
when my shoulders go back and I push my chest up

2230
04:32:04,500 --> 04:32:06,500
more than once or twice every few minutes.

2231
04:32:15,549 --> 04:32:18,120
He is but a simple human.

2232
04:32:18,120 --> 04:32:20,559
I'm going to cut off his arms

2233
04:32:20,559 --> 04:32:24,459
and we'll then proceed to slice him up nicely.

2234
04:32:24,459 --> 04:32:27,180
Hey, tell me about some of your memories.

2235
04:32:27,180 --> 04:32:30,739
Feeling sentimental, hmm?

2236
04:32:30,739 --> 04:32:34,739
I don't like it when a friend dies.

2237
04:32:34,739 --> 04:32:37,569
This happened a long time ago.

2238
04:32:37,569 --> 04:32:40,520
I went on a family trip to the sea

2239
04:32:40,520 --> 04:32:43,829
but I don't remember anything about the ocean.

2240
04:32:43,829 --> 04:32:47,670
What was burned into my memory was a shop

2241
04:32:47,670 --> 04:32:50,670
with a glass bulb hanging from the ceiling.

2242
04:32:50,709 --> 04:32:54,579
I was moved by the sound of the jingling glass.

2243
04:32:54,579 --> 04:33:00,000
And when I left the shop, there was a white lighthouse.

2244
04:33:00,000 --> 04:33:06,180
But as for where that place was, I have no idea at all.

2245
04:33:06,180 --> 04:33:08,569
That's a nice story.

2246
04:33:08,569 --> 04:33:12,659
Let's go out there and find that lighthouse together.

2247
04:33:12,659 --> 04:33:14,819
Lord Fool.

2248
04:33:14,819 --> 04:33:16,380
Thank you.

2249
04:33:16,380 --> 04:33:20,680
Now go, Black Knight direction.

2250
04:33:20,680 --> 04:33:31,869
I'm off.

2251
04:33:31,869 --> 04:33:40,299
It's a really weird way to end that cut scene, I think.

2252
04:33:40,299 --> 04:33:42,110
You know what time it is.

2253
04:33:42,110 --> 04:33:44,049
It's been at least two hours or so.

2254
04:33:44,049 --> 04:33:44,889
I get to do this.

2255
04:33:44,930 --> 04:33:47,009
And by the way, speaking of doing this,

2256
04:33:47,009 --> 04:33:50,119
what am I eating today?

2257
04:33:50,119 --> 04:33:53,349
Come on, what's the matter?

2258
04:33:53,349 --> 04:33:56,049
What do you think?

2259
04:33:56,049 --> 04:33:56,889
Burger?

2260
04:33:56,889 --> 04:33:57,889
Nah, I'm not feeling a burger.

2261
04:33:57,889 --> 04:33:58,729
Pizza?

2262
04:33:58,729 --> 04:33:59,569
Yup.

2263
04:33:59,569 --> 04:34:02,470
It's been a while since I've had pizza.

2264
04:34:03,590 --> 04:34:05,909
I haven't had pizza in a very long time.

2265
04:34:05,909 --> 04:34:08,389
Been at least a month or two, maybe.

2266
04:34:16,180 --> 04:34:17,020
Thai food?

2267
04:34:17,020 --> 04:34:17,860
Ooh.

2268
04:34:19,259 --> 04:34:20,540
That's another great option.

2269
04:34:20,540 --> 04:34:21,540
That sounds great.

2270
04:34:21,540 --> 04:34:22,380
Shepard's pie?

2271
04:34:23,619 --> 04:34:25,459
I mean, I really want that, because you just said it,

2272
04:34:25,459 --> 04:34:29,110
but that means I have to make Shepard's pie.

2273
04:34:29,110 --> 04:34:30,909
I have to make mashed potatoes.

2274
04:34:30,909 --> 04:34:32,119
Yeah.

2275
04:34:32,119 --> 04:34:34,439
I have to put some ground beef and some onions

2276
04:34:34,439 --> 04:34:35,759
into a pan, simmer that.

2277
04:34:35,759 --> 04:34:37,560
That's probably going to take some time.

2278
04:34:37,560 --> 04:34:38,400
Meow.

2279
04:34:38,400 --> 04:34:39,680
I'm going to get that right.

2280
04:34:40,560 --> 04:34:43,509
I don't have mashed potatoes.

2281
04:34:45,509 --> 04:34:47,430
I don't have any ground beef either, so.

2282
04:34:47,430 --> 04:34:48,270
Bring it.

2283
04:34:48,270 --> 04:34:50,110
Ground lamb?

2284
04:34:50,110 --> 04:34:51,950
That doesn't make any sense to me.

2285
04:34:52,909 --> 04:34:55,830
That just made me angry to look over and see that.

2286
04:34:55,830 --> 04:34:56,669
I'm sorry, guys.

2287
04:34:57,909 --> 04:34:59,069
That just threw me off.

2288
04:35:00,869 --> 04:35:02,470
Look at how bad that threw me off.

2289
04:35:06,869 --> 04:35:10,930
I think lamb, I don't like lamb.

2290
04:35:10,930 --> 04:35:12,500
I don't eat lamb.

2291
04:35:12,500 --> 04:35:13,419
I'm not into lamb.

2292
04:35:20,220 --> 04:35:21,459
What's wrong with lamb?

2293
04:35:21,459 --> 04:35:22,610
I don't like it.

2294
04:35:24,689 --> 04:35:28,279
Shepard's pie is lamb.

2295
04:35:28,279 --> 04:35:34,439
I've always had Shepard's pie with ground beef.

2296
04:35:36,110 --> 04:35:37,950
Maybe my mother made it that way

2297
04:35:37,950 --> 04:35:40,229
because she knew that I didn't like lamb.

2298
04:35:42,299 --> 04:35:44,259
That's why it's called Shepard's pie.

2299
04:35:47,299 --> 04:35:48,939
I always thought it was like Shepard's pie

2300
04:35:48,939 --> 04:35:53,310
because that's like what the Shepard ate.

2301
04:35:53,310 --> 04:35:54,150
But if that makes sense.

2302
04:35:54,150 --> 04:36:03,130
But the Shepard eats his sheep?

2303
04:36:03,130 --> 04:36:03,970
Yes.

2304
04:36:06,650 --> 04:36:08,290
Oh, they're not reindeers.

2305
04:36:08,290 --> 04:36:09,130
What am I talking about?

2306
04:36:09,130 --> 04:36:09,970
Like it doesn't fly around

2307
04:36:09,970 --> 04:36:11,529
and deliver presents to people with sheep.

2308
04:36:11,529 --> 04:36:13,409
Of course, that's what they do.

2309
04:36:13,409 --> 04:36:14,610
What am I talking about?

2310
04:36:17,139 --> 04:36:18,500
Cottage pie is the beef one.

2311
04:36:18,500 --> 04:36:19,340
Oh, okay.

2312
04:36:22,340 --> 04:36:23,180
This is fucking hard.

2313
04:36:23,180 --> 04:36:26,540
I have to get at least 10 to 20.

2314
04:36:26,540 --> 04:36:29,139
They don't raise the sheep for fun.

2315
04:36:29,139 --> 04:36:30,740
Hold on.

2316
04:36:30,740 --> 04:36:31,900
It threw me off again.

2317
04:36:36,299 --> 04:36:39,060
Well, yeah, I thought it was wool too.

2318
04:36:39,060 --> 04:36:40,419
I thought it was like wool.

2319
04:36:45,900 --> 04:36:51,779
Sheep are raised for wool and milk, you dummies.

2320
04:36:51,779 --> 04:36:55,880
I didn't think that they raise the sheep to shear the wool.

2321
04:36:55,880 --> 04:37:00,099
Yeah, they don't like raise the sheep to make Shepard's pie.

2322
04:37:00,099 --> 04:37:01,540
That's not why they do that.

2323
04:37:03,189 --> 04:37:04,029
Hold on.

2324
04:37:04,029 --> 04:37:05,430
Am I getting fucked with here?

2325
04:37:17,250 --> 04:37:19,169
Shepard's pie is any red meat.

2326
04:37:19,169 --> 04:37:20,090
That's what I thought too.

2327
04:37:20,090 --> 04:37:23,779
I think people are just being weirdos.

2328
04:37:23,779 --> 04:37:25,259
Well, I got 15.

2329
04:37:25,259 --> 04:37:26,299
Wow, that actually counted.

2330
04:37:26,299 --> 04:37:27,139
Okay, cool.

2331
04:37:38,080 --> 04:37:38,919
Oh, yeah.

2332
04:37:38,919 --> 04:37:40,080
Okay, well, that's crazy.

2333
04:37:41,159 --> 04:37:42,000
I'll take 17.

2334
04:37:50,299 --> 04:37:56,580
That's not a bad score.

2335
04:37:56,580 --> 04:38:01,180
Hey, David.

2336
04:38:01,180 --> 04:38:02,860
And probably after I beat this guy,

2337
04:38:02,860 --> 04:38:03,979
or after I fight this guy,

2338
04:38:03,979 --> 04:38:06,459
we'll probably call it here and we'll keep going tomorrow.

2339
04:38:06,459 --> 04:38:09,619
Because I'm just thinking about Shepard's pie and pizza.

2340
04:38:09,619 --> 04:38:14,020
I combined the two and Shepard's pie just turned into

2341
04:38:14,020 --> 04:38:17,779
a hamburger and onion pizza with a side of mashed potatoes.

2342
04:38:19,180 --> 04:38:21,580
And I'm gonna try to get that to be a reality.

2343
04:38:30,299 --> 04:38:31,139
Yeah, let's go.

2344
04:38:39,909 --> 04:38:41,069
Did you end the stream by accident?

2345
04:38:41,069 --> 04:38:47,459
No.

2346
04:38:47,459 --> 04:38:49,580
You want some starch with your starch.

2347
04:38:56,060 --> 04:38:57,220
So who is this?

2348
04:38:57,220 --> 04:39:00,009
I have to go to the Thunderdome, okay.

2349
04:39:00,009 --> 04:39:04,900
I need a sushi place.

2350
04:39:04,900 --> 04:39:06,139
That guy's driving backwards.

2351
04:39:06,139 --> 04:39:07,500
See that truck?

2352
04:39:07,500 --> 04:39:20,279
What the hell was that?

2353
04:39:20,279 --> 04:39:23,849
Try to find me.

2354
04:39:23,849 --> 04:39:25,450
Hey there, Mr. Assassin, let's play a game.

2355
04:39:25,450 --> 04:39:26,979
Try to find me.

2356
04:39:26,979 --> 04:39:27,799
What am I?

2357
04:39:27,799 --> 04:39:29,180
Find me and you'll know.

2358
04:39:29,180 --> 04:39:30,580
Or maybe you won't.

2359
04:39:31,419 --> 04:39:33,220
Because I am the imitator of everything.

2360
04:39:33,220 --> 04:39:40,889
I will wait for you forever in the glorious land.

2361
04:39:40,889 --> 04:39:43,979
Yes.

2362
04:39:43,979 --> 04:39:46,400
Okay, recommendations.

2363
04:39:46,400 --> 04:39:48,520
We got a new movie recommended for you.

2364
04:39:48,520 --> 04:39:49,840
51 Grams.

2365
04:39:49,840 --> 04:39:52,490
What's with the 51?

2366
04:39:52,490 --> 04:39:58,680
51st Chamber.

2367
04:39:58,680 --> 04:40:00,720
Oh, I have upgrade points.

2368
04:40:00,720 --> 04:40:03,139
Forgot about that.

2369
04:40:03,139 --> 04:40:04,299
Look at how, all right.

2370
04:40:04,299 --> 04:40:05,139
I love this game.

2371
04:40:05,139 --> 04:40:06,860
I love this series.

2372
04:40:06,860 --> 04:40:10,099
Holy shit, that building looks awful.

2373
04:40:10,099 --> 04:40:11,139
Truly awful.

2374
04:40:11,139 --> 04:40:11,979
I'm sorry, I'm just gonna,

2375
04:40:11,979 --> 04:40:13,340
I'm gonna call it exactly how I see it.

2376
04:40:13,340 --> 04:40:24,619
It looks awful.

2377
04:40:24,619 --> 04:40:26,659
There's more artifacts on that building

2378
04:40:26,659 --> 04:40:43,229
than there were in King Tut's tomb.

2379
04:40:43,229 --> 04:40:44,069
Good one.

2380
04:40:44,069 --> 04:40:52,040
Hey, thanks, man.

2381
04:40:52,040 --> 04:40:55,560
That's the only complaint of the entire game so far.

2382
04:40:55,560 --> 04:41:01,220
The only one.

2383
04:41:01,220 --> 04:41:04,630
And look, I don't even look at the buildings.

2384
04:41:04,630 --> 04:41:06,110
What am I looking at the buildings for?

2385
04:41:06,110 --> 04:41:13,349
I'm not even looking at them.

2386
04:41:13,349 --> 04:41:27,049
So the weight of that problem is very, very small.

2387
04:41:27,049 --> 04:41:28,709
Oh, all right.

2388
04:41:28,709 --> 04:41:30,369
What I wanna do here,

2389
04:41:30,369 --> 04:41:31,610
I should probably get some, a skill.

2390
04:41:31,610 --> 04:41:36,270
3,000.

2391
04:41:36,270 --> 04:41:38,119
I'll take the health upgrade.

2392
04:41:38,119 --> 04:41:39,900
Nice.

2393
04:41:40,740 --> 04:41:42,590
2,200.

2394
04:41:49,220 --> 04:41:51,700
I'm gonna have to do it at some point.

2395
04:41:51,700 --> 04:41:54,020
And now that's a running slash.

2396
04:41:54,020 --> 04:41:56,860
And then charge attack.

2397
04:41:56,860 --> 04:41:59,900
That's also really good.

2398
04:41:59,900 --> 04:42:02,049
Battery.

2399
04:42:02,049 --> 04:42:02,889
3,200.

2400
04:42:02,889 --> 04:42:04,650
Attack or, yeah, I'll do another attack.

2401
04:42:08,979 --> 04:42:11,830
I think I have enough for, no, I don't.

2402
04:42:11,830 --> 04:42:13,930
I need, no.

2403
04:42:13,930 --> 04:42:19,520
I can do another health.

2404
04:42:19,520 --> 04:42:20,729
Yeah.

2405
04:42:20,729 --> 04:42:21,569
I have 1,900.

2406
04:42:21,569 --> 04:42:22,650
I don't think I can buy anything else.

2407
04:42:22,650 --> 04:42:23,490
Can I?

2408
04:42:23,490 --> 04:42:24,330
22.

2409
04:42:24,330 --> 04:42:31,340
Oh, I can, right?

2410
04:42:31,340 --> 04:42:32,819
22, no.

2411
04:42:32,819 --> 04:42:36,110
Yeah, wait, I can.

2412
04:42:36,110 --> 04:42:37,790
Nice.

2413
04:42:37,790 --> 04:42:38,610
All right.

2414
04:42:38,610 --> 04:42:39,450
No more health for a little while.

2415
04:42:39,450 --> 04:42:40,750
I wanna do more damage.

2416
04:42:40,750 --> 04:42:44,990
Like I'm swinging too hard at stuff.

2417
04:42:44,990 --> 04:42:46,790
Long dash.

2418
04:42:46,790 --> 04:42:49,950
Oh, it's a double.

2419
04:42:49,950 --> 04:42:52,569
Mash Y to unleash a high,

2420
04:42:52,569 --> 04:42:55,770
that's really cool too.

2421
04:42:55,770 --> 04:42:59,599
Mustang dodge.

2422
04:42:59,599 --> 04:43:01,119
Ooh.

2423
04:43:01,119 --> 04:43:02,840
If you have full health and you do a perfect dodge,

2424
04:43:02,840 --> 04:43:04,119
you can just annihilate.

2425
04:43:04,119 --> 04:43:04,959
All right.

2426
04:43:04,959 --> 04:43:05,880
That's cool.

2427
04:43:05,880 --> 04:43:10,779
That's a $30,000.

2428
04:43:10,779 --> 04:43:13,970
All right.

2429
04:43:13,970 --> 04:43:23,459
Let's also check, look at this.

2430
04:43:23,459 --> 04:43:24,900
What can I make?

2431
04:43:24,900 --> 04:43:29,139
Can I make a third one of these?

2432
04:43:29,139 --> 04:43:31,569
Uh, no, I can't.

2433
04:43:31,569 --> 04:43:34,459
Can I make another one of those?

2434
04:43:34,459 --> 04:43:37,139
Heavy attack power down, normal attack up.

2435
04:43:37,139 --> 04:43:40,880
Currently doing a lot of heavy attacks.

2436
04:43:40,880 --> 04:43:42,619
Cannot create.

2437
04:43:42,619 --> 04:43:46,450
Death force attack power 10% up.

2438
04:43:46,450 --> 04:43:51,619
A lot of materials.

2439
04:43:51,619 --> 04:43:53,540
When health is at 20% or below,

2440
04:43:53,540 --> 04:43:55,860
weapon attack power is plus 15%.

2441
04:44:03,779 --> 04:44:09,290
I feel like I'd be too scared to be that low.

2442
04:44:09,290 --> 04:44:11,849
You're at 88% or above, 8% up.

2443
04:44:11,849 --> 04:44:16,080
I kind of like that.

2444
04:44:16,080 --> 04:44:19,180
I kind of want like a three of those.

2445
04:44:19,180 --> 04:44:20,619
During slow down after a perfect dodge,

2446
04:44:20,619 --> 04:44:22,180
attack power is plus 10%.

2447
04:44:22,180 --> 04:44:27,360
That's cool.

2448
04:44:27,360 --> 04:44:30,119
Weapon attack power down, but damage taken down.

2449
04:44:36,340 --> 04:44:40,240
Successful guard power consumed 20% down.

2450
04:44:40,240 --> 04:44:49,200
How long though?

2451
04:44:49,200 --> 04:44:50,279
Health is at 80%.

2452
04:44:50,279 --> 04:44:51,119
All right.

2453
04:44:51,119 --> 04:44:54,979
Let's make, make this one.

2454
04:44:54,979 --> 04:44:58,029
No, where is it?

2455
04:44:58,029 --> 04:44:59,509
So when I'm at 80% or higher,

2456
04:44:59,509 --> 04:45:02,770
my weapon attack is 8% up.

2457
04:45:02,770 --> 04:45:03,650
Cause I'll replace one of the ones

2458
04:45:03,650 --> 04:45:04,490
that makes me take more damage.

2459
04:45:04,490 --> 04:45:09,709
Yeah, I want this one.

2460
04:45:09,709 --> 04:45:11,189
Cause I usually try to stay above 80%.

2461
04:45:11,189 --> 04:45:12,349
I'm a maniac.

2462
04:45:12,349 --> 04:45:15,799
I freak out if I'm not.

2463
04:45:16,680 --> 04:45:17,520
What does the tension gauge do?

2464
04:45:17,520 --> 04:45:24,360
I actually don't know.

2465
04:45:24,360 --> 04:45:25,319
Okay.

2466
04:45:25,319 --> 04:45:27,560
Damage taken 5% up, weapon attack power.

2467
04:45:27,560 --> 04:45:31,180
I think I, maybe I'll get rid of this one.

2468
04:45:31,180 --> 04:45:37,240
Getting me into too much trouble.

2469
04:45:37,240 --> 04:45:42,029
So now I just do 10% more damage,

2470
04:45:42,029 --> 04:45:43,590
which includes heavy,

2471
04:45:43,590 --> 04:45:45,869
but also the regular attack power too.

2472
04:45:45,869 --> 04:45:56,159
Yeah, I like that.

2473
04:45:56,159 --> 04:45:58,939
Refill on sushi.

2474
04:45:58,939 --> 04:46:00,220
Oh, it's the tiger thing in the corner.

2475
04:46:00,220 --> 04:46:01,060
All right.

2476
04:46:04,310 --> 04:46:06,470
Eat something, can't eat in.

2477
04:46:10,119 --> 04:46:10,959
All right.

2478
04:46:10,959 --> 04:46:11,799
I need five of these.

2479
04:46:13,220 --> 04:46:16,000
Essentially makes me run out of money.

2480
04:46:16,000 --> 04:46:20,720
I haven't used any of these.

2481
04:46:20,720 --> 04:46:21,759
All right.

2482
04:46:21,759 --> 04:46:24,250
I have to pee, but I'm going to hold it.

2483
04:46:24,250 --> 04:46:25,090
No I'm not.

2484
04:46:25,090 --> 04:46:26,099
I'll be right back.

2485
04:46:26,099 --> 04:46:27,220
All right, this is the final break of the evening.

2486
04:46:27,220 --> 04:46:28,099
I will take a piss.

2487
04:46:28,099 --> 04:46:29,020
I'll be right back.

2488
04:46:29,020 --> 04:46:30,919
We're going to try to beat this boss

2489
04:46:30,919 --> 04:46:31,759
and we'll probably call it there

2490
04:46:31,759 --> 04:46:32,880
and I'll see you tomorrow.

2491
04:46:32,880 --> 04:46:34,159
So I'll be right back.

2492
04:46:34,159 --> 04:49:23,599
We'll try to fight the boss.

2493
04:49:23,599 --> 04:49:24,439
Damn.

2494
04:49:27,610 --> 04:49:30,290
You know, it's time to like change the pants you have

2495
04:49:30,290 --> 04:49:31,130
or the underwear.

2496
04:49:31,130 --> 04:49:33,310
Like what the hell?

2497
04:49:33,310 --> 04:49:37,659
So the band of my underwear

2498
04:49:37,819 --> 04:49:41,009
has apparently been, this whole time,

2499
04:49:41,009 --> 04:49:42,810
so tight around my waist

2500
04:49:42,810 --> 04:49:45,959
and I haven't even really noticed

2501
04:49:45,959 --> 04:49:50,790
that I have those just two indent lines

2502
04:49:50,790 --> 04:49:56,040
where the elastic is around my entire body

2503
04:49:56,040 --> 04:49:58,479
and it hurts.

2504
04:49:58,479 --> 04:50:00,340
This actually hurts.

2505
04:50:00,340 --> 04:50:02,669
Ow.

2506
04:50:02,669 --> 04:50:03,509
What the hell?

2507
04:50:03,509 --> 04:50:10,729
How fat am I getting?

2508
04:50:10,729 --> 04:50:11,810
Dude, it's time for new underwear.

2509
04:50:11,810 --> 04:50:13,209
This is nice underwear.

2510
04:50:13,209 --> 04:50:17,009
This is, I just don't fit into it anymore.

2511
04:50:17,009 --> 04:50:22,919
Oh well, whatever.

2512
04:50:22,919 --> 04:50:28,650
Let's come back.

2513
04:50:28,650 --> 04:50:31,720
I'm trying to plan a workout stream.

2514
04:50:31,720 --> 04:50:34,860
Yeah, I need to, I need to figure that out.

2515
04:50:34,860 --> 04:50:35,700
All right, whatever.

2516
04:50:35,700 --> 04:50:38,569
Let's go.

2517
04:50:38,569 --> 04:50:48,759
Try to fight this next boss.

2518
04:50:48,759 --> 04:50:52,060
Save the game.

2519
04:50:52,060 --> 04:51:05,520
All right, I wonder what this boss is going to be like.

2520
04:51:05,520 --> 04:51:06,360
What's going on?

2521
04:51:06,360 --> 04:51:09,349
I just got some cheese sticks.

2522
04:51:09,349 --> 04:51:11,930
I just actually got fish sticks recently.

2523
04:51:11,930 --> 04:51:22,509
Those things are so good.

2524
04:51:22,509 --> 04:51:25,959
You?

2525
04:51:25,959 --> 04:51:27,459
You, really?

2526
04:51:27,459 --> 04:51:29,139
I love, those are amazing.

2527
04:51:29,139 --> 04:51:32,279
I love fish sticks.

2528
04:51:32,279 --> 04:51:37,430
Yes, I've seen the South Park episode.

2529
04:51:37,430 --> 04:51:51,490
I think we all have.

2530
04:51:51,490 --> 04:51:52,330
All right, so we're going to get on the highway

2531
04:51:52,330 --> 04:51:58,590
and we're going to go back to the Thunderdome.

2532
04:51:58,590 --> 04:52:00,509
You eat like a toddler.

2533
04:52:00,509 --> 04:52:02,959
I've, no, I don't.

2534
04:52:02,959 --> 04:52:05,950
But let's be fair though.

2535
04:52:05,950 --> 04:52:11,500
The kids menu at every major restaurant

2536
04:52:11,500 --> 04:52:13,259
always seems to have some real good shit on it

2537
04:52:13,259 --> 04:52:16,130
that you know you would enjoy, doesn't it?

2538
04:52:16,130 --> 04:52:24,639
I don't order off the kids menu, but I'm just being honest.

2539
04:52:24,639 --> 04:52:28,200
You can't look at the kids menu and go, ugh.

2540
04:52:28,200 --> 04:52:30,639
Chicken nuggets, ugh, gross.

2541
04:52:30,639 --> 04:52:32,000
Mac and cheese, disgusting.

2542
04:52:32,000 --> 04:52:33,279
I, ugh, ugh.

2543
04:52:34,200 --> 04:52:38,040
French fries, onion rings, ugh.

2544
04:52:38,040 --> 04:52:40,000
Apple slices, ugh.

2545
04:52:40,000 --> 04:52:45,000
Please, you probably, if you order from McDonald's,

2546
04:52:45,759 --> 04:52:48,060
anything off the whole menu,

2547
04:52:48,060 --> 04:52:51,569
then don't give me shit for looking at the kids menu.

2548
04:52:51,569 --> 04:53:02,000
Him, would be fair about that.

2549
04:53:02,000 --> 04:53:03,500
Grow up.

2550
04:53:03,500 --> 04:53:08,500
I, look, I eat boring stuff too, like salads.

2551
04:53:08,500 --> 04:53:16,139
Caesar salad, ooh, a chopped salad.

2552
04:53:16,139 --> 04:53:19,619
I eat, oh, like a baked fish.

2553
04:53:19,619 --> 04:53:23,200
That was delicious.

2554
04:53:23,200 --> 04:53:24,040
That is fun.

2555
04:53:30,529 --> 04:53:31,689
Tuna is one of my favorite things.

2556
04:53:31,689 --> 04:53:42,909
Yeah, I love to salmon, I love tuna.

2557
04:53:42,909 --> 04:53:48,770
Caesar salad, oh, mega lull, why?

2558
04:53:48,770 --> 04:53:51,889
And by the way, what fancy ass restaurants and food,

2559
04:53:51,889 --> 04:53:56,580
what are you eating every day?

2560
04:53:56,580 --> 04:54:12,130
Do you guys have like a personal chef?

2561
04:54:12,130 --> 04:54:17,400
That sucked, the fight here.

2562
04:54:17,400 --> 04:54:25,659
Let's just do the boss.

2563
04:54:25,659 --> 04:54:33,069
I'm an adult, I know how to cook.

2564
04:54:33,069 --> 04:54:34,979
Really?

2565
04:54:34,979 --> 04:54:38,619
The number eight ranked assassin is Black Knight Direction.

2566
04:54:38,619 --> 04:54:40,959
He is a space kidnapper.

2567
04:54:40,959 --> 04:54:43,959
He uses an illegal unlicensed transfer machine

2568
04:54:43,959 --> 04:54:47,159
to kidnap important and valuable people in space

2569
04:54:47,159 --> 04:54:49,119
and sell them to the powerful.

2570
04:54:49,119 --> 04:54:51,240
But dressing, I like a lemon, lemon vinaigrette.

2571
04:54:51,240 --> 04:54:53,689
Absolutely wild, Travis.

2572
04:54:53,689 --> 04:54:55,849
To the garden of insanity.

2573
04:54:55,849 --> 04:54:58,959
I just like olive oil.

2574
04:54:58,959 --> 04:55:02,790
Olive oil is pretty good for just a salad dressing.

2575
04:55:02,790 --> 04:55:04,869
I actually like olive oil and pasta.

2576
04:55:04,869 --> 04:55:09,130
So, I'm less a fan of red and white sauce on pasta

2577
04:55:09,130 --> 04:55:13,169
and more just olive oil and salt.

2578
04:55:13,169 --> 04:55:14,849
It's like, oh, pasta, that sounds good.

2579
04:55:14,849 --> 04:55:16,450
That's how I like it, preferred.

2580
04:55:23,310 --> 04:55:27,889
That's drive, mini girl.

2581
04:55:27,889 --> 04:55:29,290
Have I done enough wrestling moves?

2582
04:55:29,290 --> 04:55:32,220
No.

2583
04:55:32,220 --> 04:55:35,340
Olive oil by itself, yeah.

2584
04:55:35,340 --> 04:55:37,340
Olive oil, salt, and Parmesan on pasta is perfect.

2585
04:55:37,340 --> 04:55:38,990
It is.

2586
04:55:38,990 --> 04:55:45,330
I just like to get a really, really good EVOO.

2587
04:55:45,330 --> 04:55:53,810
A lot of stuff to do in this game, it's insane.

2588
04:55:53,810 --> 04:56:02,759
Where's this toilet?

2589
04:56:02,759 --> 04:56:03,680
I like omelets.

2590
04:56:03,680 --> 04:56:09,139
I love eggs too, yeah.

2591
04:56:09,139 --> 04:56:15,669
Omelets, like a fried rice with egg, awesome.

2592
04:56:15,669 --> 04:56:16,950
I love sauteed vegetables

2593
04:56:16,950 --> 04:56:19,110
and like just grilled chicken in a way.

2594
04:56:19,270 --> 04:56:25,029
I'm a big fan of a lot of different foods.

2595
04:56:25,029 --> 04:56:27,669
You like all cheeses, not all cheeses.

2596
04:56:27,669 --> 04:56:29,750
I actually don't really love soft cheeses.

2597
04:56:29,750 --> 04:56:31,069
I'm not a big brie person.

2598
04:56:31,950 --> 04:56:39,180
I like hard cheeses, not soft.

2599
04:56:39,180 --> 04:56:40,020
Cringe.

2600
04:56:46,299 --> 04:56:49,720
I love horseradish, one of my favorite things.

2601
04:56:51,369 --> 04:56:53,250
The wasabi that you get at restaurants,

2602
04:56:53,250 --> 04:56:54,369
that's not real wasabi,

2603
04:56:54,369 --> 04:56:57,560
it's just horseradish that's dyed green.

2604
04:56:57,560 --> 04:56:58,479
I love that stuff.

2605
04:56:58,479 --> 04:56:59,840
I wish I could, I put it on everything.

2606
04:56:59,840 --> 04:57:02,319
I could put that on literally every single food

2607
04:57:02,319 --> 04:57:11,200
that I've ever eaten and love it.

2608
04:57:11,200 --> 04:57:12,040
What about sauerkraut?

2609
04:57:12,040 --> 04:57:29,970
No, I'm actually not a big sauerkraut fan.

2610
04:57:29,970 --> 04:57:32,750
Put it on your Captain Crunch.

2611
04:57:32,750 --> 04:57:36,209
I actually, that's falling out of favor.

2612
04:57:36,209 --> 04:57:40,180
The Dunkin' Donuts mocha latte cereal

2613
04:57:40,180 --> 04:57:43,060
has taken over completely at this point.

2614
04:57:43,060 --> 04:57:50,259
Almost 100%.

2615
04:57:50,259 --> 04:58:02,290
All right, let's do it.

2616
04:58:02,290 --> 04:58:03,810
How is this place?

2617
04:58:03,810 --> 04:58:06,130
Looks like something out of Black Raid.

2618
04:58:06,130 --> 04:58:08,049
So is this Osaka?

2619
04:58:08,049 --> 04:58:09,569
Yes, gotta be.

2620
04:58:09,569 --> 04:58:11,770
Everyone's wearing tigers on their clothes.

2621
04:58:16,180 --> 04:58:17,139
He's here. Hello.

2622
04:58:17,700 --> 04:58:19,259
He's gonna fight in the street?

2623
04:58:19,259 --> 04:58:23,659
Probably.

2624
04:58:23,659 --> 04:58:25,860
Sense anything.

2625
04:58:25,860 --> 04:58:27,540
Some kind of zen thing, maybe?

2626
04:58:31,180 --> 04:58:32,020
The fuck?

2627
04:58:36,240 --> 04:58:37,400
Culture, huh?

2628
04:58:37,400 --> 04:58:38,919
Didn't your mama teach you

2629
04:58:38,919 --> 04:58:41,000
that it is not okay to steal shit?

2630
04:58:41,000 --> 04:58:42,479
They do this every game.

2631
04:58:43,779 --> 04:58:47,560
This isn't your scene.

2632
04:58:47,560 --> 04:58:49,959
I got no idea who the hell you are.

2633
04:58:49,959 --> 04:58:51,759
But stay the fuck out of this.

2634
04:58:51,759 --> 04:58:55,080
This town's problems are my problems.

2635
04:58:55,080 --> 04:58:56,840
You're just like they say.

2636
04:58:57,680 --> 04:58:58,880
I've also heard that you can't solve a thing

2637
04:58:58,880 --> 04:59:00,279
without brute force.

2638
04:59:00,279 --> 04:59:01,799
Look, outsider.

2639
04:59:01,799 --> 04:59:04,200
Who the fuck are you anyway?

2640
04:59:04,200 --> 04:59:05,799
I'm from the future.

2641
04:59:05,799 --> 04:59:07,279
It's a long story, but...

2642
04:59:07,279 --> 04:59:08,520
Don't bother.

2643
04:59:08,520 --> 04:59:12,080
Once we do battle, I'll know all I need to know.

2644
04:59:12,080 --> 04:59:13,759
When am I gonna get my next katana upgrade?

2645
04:59:13,759 --> 04:59:15,639
I won't hold back.

2646
04:59:15,639 --> 04:59:16,479
Hell yeah.

2647
04:59:16,479 --> 04:59:17,319
I wonder how many katanas are in the game.

2648
04:59:17,319 --> 04:59:18,560
That's what I wanna hear.

2649
04:59:18,560 --> 04:59:19,720
Bring it!

2650
04:59:19,720 --> 04:59:21,680
Activate Night Reaper mode.

2651
04:59:21,680 --> 04:59:25,159
Strawberry on the sweet shortcake.

2652
04:59:26,119 --> 04:59:26,959
What?

2653
04:59:31,700 --> 04:59:33,950
Oh my God, I'm in Mustang mode.

2654
04:59:33,950 --> 04:59:34,790
I'm in, where is he?

2655
04:59:34,790 --> 04:59:36,509
I'm in Mustang mode, please.

2656
04:59:36,509 --> 04:59:39,659
Oh, that's sad.

2657
04:59:39,659 --> 04:59:51,090
It's all the way down here.

2658
04:59:51,090 --> 04:59:53,490
Your killer instinct is simply unmatched.

2659
04:59:53,490 --> 04:59:56,209
I can feel it all the way down in my bones.

2660
04:59:56,209 --> 04:59:57,889
I want to express my respect

2661
04:59:57,889 --> 05:00:01,290
for that fighting spirit and bloodlust, grandpa.

2662
05:00:01,290 --> 05:00:03,290
This is Death Slow.

2663
05:00:03,290 --> 05:00:11,459
It's quite an elegant ability, perfect for you.

2664
05:00:11,459 --> 05:00:13,959
Death Slow.

2665
05:00:13,959 --> 05:00:15,520
If you're quite a new skill,

2666
05:00:15,520 --> 05:00:19,849
use its strange power to slow down time in your vicinity.

2667
05:00:19,849 --> 05:00:21,810
Unleash it by holding L and pressing A.

2668
05:00:21,810 --> 05:00:23,409
So L and A.

2669
05:00:23,409 --> 05:00:24,650
That has a cooldown.

2670
05:00:24,650 --> 05:00:25,490
Okay.

2671
05:00:30,630 --> 05:00:31,470
This guy should provide it now.

2672
05:00:31,470 --> 05:00:36,279
I think I have four viewers watching.

2673
05:00:36,279 --> 05:00:37,119
Wait, hold on.

2674
05:00:37,119 --> 05:00:39,340
Hold on, they're coming.

2675
05:00:39,340 --> 05:00:44,540
10, 12, 13, 14, 15.

2676
05:00:44,540 --> 05:00:47,159
Holy shit, here it goes.

2677
05:00:47,159 --> 05:00:50,819
20, 21, 26.

2678
05:00:50,819 --> 05:00:57,099
Well, I mean, we kinda have to wait for people, right?

2679
05:00:57,139 --> 05:00:58,619
I wonder how quickly, something like this.

2680
05:00:58,619 --> 05:00:59,819
Oh, there's two people,

2681
05:00:59,819 --> 05:01:01,340
like there's two assassins fighting each other

2682
05:01:01,340 --> 05:01:03,700
in the street on Twitch right now.

2683
05:01:03,700 --> 05:01:04,740
They have like magic powers.

2684
05:01:04,740 --> 05:01:08,889
Like how fast would this go up, do you think?

2685
05:01:08,889 --> 05:01:10,689
Okay, let's do Death Slow.

2686
05:01:27,639 --> 05:01:38,020
Okay, so I slow time down and, where'd he go?

2687
05:01:38,020 --> 05:01:44,770
50 viewer Andy.

2688
05:01:44,770 --> 05:01:46,330
This is less of a boss fight and more of a,

2689
05:01:46,330 --> 05:01:47,450
I'm teaching you moves.

2690
05:01:47,450 --> 05:01:50,880
I'm probably gonna fight him after.

2691
05:01:50,880 --> 05:01:52,240
This would sit at one viewer.

2692
05:01:52,240 --> 05:02:02,299
No, it would not.

2693
05:02:02,299 --> 05:02:04,220
And dream about our battle of souls.

2694
05:02:04,220 --> 05:02:08,650
I want to see how you do once you're more evolved.

2695
05:02:08,650 --> 05:02:10,849
Something I'd like you to have, Grandpa.

2696
05:02:10,849 --> 05:02:11,770
This is the Death Force.

2697
05:02:11,770 --> 05:02:13,770
It's quite violent, perfect for you.

2698
05:02:19,029 --> 05:02:22,389
Okay, X.

2699
05:02:22,389 --> 05:02:24,389
Use its mysterious power to knock enemies back.

2700
05:02:24,389 --> 05:02:32,830
Unleash your, okay, so it was a knockback.

2701
05:02:32,830 --> 05:02:33,669
Okay, try it out.

2702
05:02:45,229 --> 05:02:47,069
Oh, all right, that's cool.

2703
05:02:52,020 --> 05:02:56,009
That's very useful.

2704
05:02:56,049 --> 05:03:12,540
It's just a force push.

2705
05:03:12,540 --> 05:03:17,590
Travis not being in Smash is a crime.

2706
05:03:17,590 --> 05:03:19,540
I don't know.

2707
05:03:19,540 --> 05:03:22,180
They've used mature games before.

2708
05:03:22,180 --> 05:03:25,659
Bayonetta.

2709
05:03:25,659 --> 05:03:28,500
And honestly, No More Heroes is just,

2710
05:03:28,500 --> 05:03:31,279
has been a Nintendo exclusive.

2711
05:03:31,279 --> 05:03:34,799
They've ported it years later to other platforms,

2712
05:03:34,799 --> 05:03:42,180
but it comes out on Nintendo platforms every time.

2713
05:03:42,180 --> 05:03:48,779
He's a Smash costume fighter.

2714
05:03:48,779 --> 05:03:50,500
By the way, have they ran out of character slots

2715
05:03:50,500 --> 05:03:53,099
to fit on the screen in Smash Brothers yet?

2716
05:03:53,099 --> 05:03:55,340
Or is that still, they still have enough room?

2717
05:03:59,259 --> 05:04:00,099
Okay, imagine what it takes.

2718
05:04:00,099 --> 05:04:02,659
Before we take each other on, I have a present for you.

2719
05:04:02,659 --> 05:04:04,419
There's literally one more left.

2720
05:04:08,040 --> 05:04:16,810
This is Death Rain.

2721
05:04:16,810 --> 05:04:19,810
Use its weird power to pour down a rain of pain.

2722
05:04:19,810 --> 05:04:22,290
So it's like a, okay, try it.

2723
05:04:40,619 --> 05:04:43,979
Ow, what just hit me?

2724
05:04:43,979 --> 05:04:45,340
I get hurt by my own shit?

2725
05:04:55,959 --> 05:05:00,139
Did I win?

2726
05:05:00,139 --> 05:05:01,700
Favorite burger from Burger King.

2727
05:05:01,700 --> 05:05:02,819
It's not a burger.

2728
05:05:02,819 --> 05:05:05,540
It's my favorite, it's the Burger King long chicken.

2729
05:05:07,240 --> 05:05:12,650
Who do you keep tossing out all this fucking foreshadowing?

2730
05:05:12,650 --> 05:05:16,020
I'll explain it all once I take you down.

2731
05:05:16,020 --> 05:05:17,700
Really talk a lot of shit.

2732
05:05:17,700 --> 05:05:20,700
This is where I actually start trying.

2733
05:05:20,700 --> 05:05:26,860
Good, get ready, grandpa.

2734
05:05:26,860 --> 05:05:32,270
Long chicken.

2735
05:05:32,270 --> 05:05:33,549
What's your damn mouth?

2736
05:05:33,549 --> 05:05:36,470
I'm not even close to being a grandpa yet.

2737
05:05:36,470 --> 05:05:39,150
Now it's time for a little spanking.

2738
05:05:39,150 --> 05:05:43,860
All right, time for the real fight.

2739
05:05:43,860 --> 05:05:45,659
Hey, that was not fair, okay?

2740
05:05:45,659 --> 05:05:53,130
I just like literally spawned in.

2741
05:05:53,130 --> 05:05:54,529
Those of you that are saying long chicken,

2742
05:05:54,569 --> 05:05:55,610
omega lol, question mark.

2743
05:05:55,610 --> 05:05:57,209
He's stupid, he's an idiot, long chicken.

2744
05:05:57,209 --> 05:05:58,930
What's long chicken?

2745
05:05:58,930 --> 05:05:59,770
That's not what it's called.

2746
05:05:59,770 --> 05:06:01,529
It's the original chicken sandwich.

2747
05:06:01,529 --> 05:06:02,889
Original chicken sandwich, Jermo.

2748
05:06:02,889 --> 05:06:06,049
What are you, stupid?

2749
05:06:06,049 --> 05:06:12,250
That's fine, that's okay.

2750
05:06:12,250 --> 05:06:18,659
That's completely fine.

2751
05:06:18,659 --> 05:06:20,220
No, that's fine, that's cool.

2752
05:06:22,959 --> 05:06:29,849
He's an idiot, stupid idiot.

2753
05:06:29,849 --> 05:06:32,450
What's that say?

2754
05:06:32,450 --> 05:06:33,529
What's that say?

2755
05:06:33,529 --> 05:06:40,080
Something on there text-wise?

2756
05:06:40,080 --> 05:06:46,250
Interesting.

2757
05:06:46,250 --> 05:06:51,840
What's starting at $20,000?

2758
05:06:51,840 --> 05:06:55,369
Is that rent?

2759
05:06:55,369 --> 05:06:56,689
What is that?

2760
05:06:56,689 --> 05:07:01,090
What is that?

2761
05:07:01,090 --> 05:07:02,810
I can't, I don't know what that is,

2762
05:07:02,810 --> 05:07:08,979
but I don't think I can afford that.

2763
05:07:08,979 --> 05:07:13,849
Holy shit.

2764
05:07:13,849 --> 05:07:17,779
That's not what that meant, right?

2765
05:07:17,779 --> 05:07:20,779
Oh my god, that's not a targeted ad.

2766
05:07:20,779 --> 05:07:23,180
No, I don't have that kind of fucking money.

2767
05:07:27,860 --> 05:07:29,659
Targeted advertising.

2768
05:07:29,659 --> 05:07:40,360
That's so stupid.

2769
05:07:40,360 --> 05:07:42,240
I would never, ever,

2770
05:07:42,240 --> 05:07:44,779
and I don't think that's what that was.

2771
05:07:44,779 --> 05:07:48,520
Was that like a dining room set?

2772
05:07:48,520 --> 05:07:50,819
I think that was like a yearly payment.

2773
05:07:50,819 --> 05:07:55,220
I have no idea, I have no clue.

2774
05:07:55,740 --> 05:07:58,819
How much is that a year?

2775
05:07:58,819 --> 05:08:00,740
Hold on a second.

2776
05:08:00,740 --> 05:08:01,819
I need to do a calculation.

2777
05:08:01,819 --> 05:08:03,619
I am so taken aback.

2778
05:08:03,619 --> 05:08:05,659
I don't even know what we're just looking at.

2779
05:08:05,659 --> 05:08:14,819
Hold on, this is important.

2780
05:08:14,819 --> 05:08:21,430
$240,000 a year for rent?

2781
05:08:21,430 --> 05:08:30,900
$20,000 a month?

2782
05:08:30,900 --> 05:08:41,500
Holy shit.

2783
05:08:41,500 --> 05:08:42,979
That's unbelievable.

2784
05:08:43,860 --> 05:08:46,130
I really thought that that was,

2785
05:08:46,130 --> 05:08:50,590
maybe, are we crazy?

2786
05:08:50,590 --> 05:08:51,590
Damn, that's, I don't,

2787
05:08:51,590 --> 05:08:53,150
got that money, if you got that kind of money,

2788
05:08:53,150 --> 05:08:58,580
whatever, that's not me.

2789
05:08:58,580 --> 05:09:09,169
That's a mogul move?

2790
05:09:09,169 --> 05:09:10,409
It's a targeted ad.

2791
05:09:10,409 --> 05:09:11,970
That's my, okay,

2792
05:09:11,970 --> 05:09:13,529
that's my top 10 favorite moment,

2793
05:09:13,529 --> 05:09:14,849
I think, that's ever happened on stream.

2794
05:09:14,849 --> 05:09:18,139
That's hilarious.

2795
05:09:18,139 --> 05:09:19,540
I don't even know what to say.

2796
05:09:19,540 --> 05:09:20,779
That's fucking hilarious.

2797
05:09:29,669 --> 05:09:30,509
All right, be easy.

2798
05:09:30,509 --> 05:09:38,209
Hold on.

2799
05:09:38,209 --> 05:09:39,290
I can't get over that.

2800
05:09:39,290 --> 05:09:40,689
I don't even know the,

2801
05:09:40,689 --> 05:09:41,849
wait, activate it.

2802
05:09:46,330 --> 05:09:47,889
Nice flex on your viewers.

2803
05:09:47,889 --> 05:09:59,599
I honestly, God, don't know why the fuck I got that.

2804
05:09:59,599 --> 05:10:04,380
Oh, I am bashing the shit out of this guy.

2805
05:10:04,380 --> 05:10:05,900
Oh, yep, yep.

2806
05:10:05,900 --> 05:10:11,560
Reign of hell.

2807
05:10:11,560 --> 05:10:12,720
You give me these crazy moves,

2808
05:10:12,720 --> 05:10:14,799
I'm just beating the shit out of this guy.

2809
05:10:14,799 --> 05:10:19,619
This guy doesn't stand a chance.

2810
05:10:19,619 --> 05:10:24,740
Rented a battery, that's what's making me have to leave.

2811
05:10:24,740 --> 05:10:25,580
Oh, what's that?

2812
05:10:25,580 --> 05:10:29,819
Oh, sorry.

2813
05:10:29,819 --> 05:10:37,580
Just get perfect dodged, is that what happened?

2814
05:10:37,580 --> 05:10:44,509
I'm embarrassing this guy right now.

2815
05:10:44,509 --> 05:10:57,150
Oh, that exploded, all right, whatever.

2816
05:10:57,150 --> 05:11:03,490
Oh, double.

2817
05:11:03,490 --> 05:11:05,189
You see that?

2818
05:11:05,189 --> 05:11:16,349
You paying attention?

2819
05:11:16,349 --> 05:11:18,389
Holy shit, I annihilated this guy.

2820
05:11:29,819 --> 05:11:45,900
All right, this three, I'm gonna be careful.

2821
05:11:45,939 --> 05:11:55,529
Oh shit, easy, easy, easy.

2822
05:11:55,529 --> 05:11:58,669
Oh, get cocky, there's no reason to be cocky.

2823
05:12:02,279 --> 05:12:07,709
That's fucking battery problem.

2824
05:12:07,709 --> 05:12:11,709
Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho.

2825
05:12:15,810 --> 05:12:32,459
Oh, see you later.

2826
05:12:32,459 --> 05:12:33,700
See you later, goodbye.

2827
05:12:35,439 --> 05:12:37,240
I know this guy's probably tutorial to teach you the moves,

2828
05:12:37,240 --> 05:12:49,830
but I had a good time on that one.

2829
05:12:49,830 --> 05:12:55,709
Not done yet.

2830
05:12:55,709 --> 05:12:56,790
That was quick.

2831
05:12:56,790 --> 05:12:58,029
Over there.

2832
05:12:58,029 --> 05:12:59,509
That's not gonna be a C rank, no way.

2833
05:12:59,509 --> 05:13:00,349
Not yet.

2834
05:13:01,189 --> 05:13:14,090
You gonna die on me without explaining all that bullshit?

2835
05:13:14,090 --> 05:13:17,090
Whatever, you can tell me in the next world.

2836
05:13:19,049 --> 05:13:20,090
Oh.

2837
05:13:20,090 --> 05:13:21,169
What the hell?

2838
05:13:21,169 --> 05:13:22,849
My katana won't budge.

2839
05:13:26,880 --> 05:13:30,060
I can't kill him?

2840
05:13:30,060 --> 05:13:33,169
That's gotta be S, right?

2841
05:13:33,169 --> 05:13:35,599
How?

2842
05:13:35,599 --> 05:13:36,840
I did everything so well.

2843
05:13:36,840 --> 05:13:41,169
I beat him in three minutes.

2844
05:13:41,169 --> 05:13:44,819
I beat that guy in three minutes.

2845
05:13:44,819 --> 05:13:57,200
It's a C.

2846
05:13:57,200 --> 05:13:59,919
Congratulations, you have been recognized

2847
05:13:59,919 --> 05:14:03,000
as number eight in the galactic rankings.

2848
05:14:03,000 --> 05:14:05,279
Looks like you're doing okay.

2849
05:14:05,279 --> 05:14:07,599
Hey, who the hell was that guy?

2850
05:14:11,189 --> 05:14:12,590
There is your answer.

2851
05:14:12,590 --> 05:14:15,069
Your body instinctively jumped into action,

2852
05:14:15,069 --> 05:14:17,990
trying to prevent his kid from getting hurt.

2853
05:14:17,990 --> 05:14:19,590
Why is that?

2854
05:14:19,590 --> 05:14:20,869
What the hell do you mean?

2855
05:14:20,869 --> 05:14:23,069
Someone starts to fall, you help them out.

2856
05:14:23,069 --> 05:14:25,470
Is this my son?

2857
05:14:25,470 --> 05:14:27,029
You are an assassin.

2858
05:14:27,029 --> 05:14:29,110
What are you doing helping people?

2859
05:14:29,110 --> 05:14:30,869
Have you ever helped out any of your other opponents?

2860
05:14:30,869 --> 05:14:32,310
Definitely my kid.

2861
05:14:32,869 --> 05:14:34,830
Why would someone as bloodthirsty as you

2862
05:14:34,830 --> 05:14:37,189
try to save another ranked assassin?

2863
05:14:38,150 --> 05:14:39,349
The reason is.

2864
05:14:39,349 --> 05:14:41,310
Is what?

2865
05:14:41,310 --> 05:14:42,790
A secret.

2866
05:14:42,790 --> 05:14:45,029
A secret guy, huh?

2867
05:14:45,029 --> 05:14:48,709
Whatever.

2868
05:14:48,709 --> 05:14:50,389
Go ahead and sleep here.

2869
05:14:50,389 --> 05:14:53,619
Rest it off.

2870
05:14:53,619 --> 05:14:57,740
I see you've gotten comfy in the Garden of Slaughter.

2871
05:14:57,740 --> 05:15:00,380
Now, Travis, go.

2872
05:15:00,380 --> 05:15:02,659
Off to swim the Sea of Blood.

2873
05:15:04,020 --> 05:15:09,340
Well, I'm really happy that they pulled the...

2874
05:15:09,340 --> 05:15:10,659
Here comes a boss.

2875
05:15:10,659 --> 05:15:12,419
Just kidding, someone's gonna kill that boss

2876
05:15:12,419 --> 05:15:16,970
and you fight somebody different for the third time.

2877
05:15:16,970 --> 05:15:20,299
They really love that joke.

2878
05:15:20,299 --> 05:15:28,250
They love it so much.

2879
05:15:28,250 --> 05:15:30,049
It's weird, because I'm just sitting here thinking,

2880
05:15:30,049 --> 05:15:32,529
which one of these guys are they gonna do that to?

2881
05:15:32,529 --> 05:15:37,979
So we got our answer.

2882
05:15:37,979 --> 05:15:56,849
It's like the fall joke for me, yeah?

2883
05:15:56,849 --> 05:16:02,889
20K.

2884
05:16:02,889 --> 05:16:11,520
No.

2885
05:16:11,520 --> 05:16:12,520
When are you gonna buy a mansion?

2886
05:16:12,520 --> 05:16:21,799
I'm not gonna buy a mansion.

2887
05:16:21,799 --> 05:16:23,759
Okay, the prospect is terrifying to me.

2888
05:16:23,799 --> 05:16:26,799
Look, and if you got money, you got money, right?

2889
05:16:26,799 --> 05:16:28,599
If you got a lot of money, if you got a lot of money,

2890
05:16:28,599 --> 05:16:29,439
do whatever you want.

2891
05:16:29,439 --> 05:16:30,479
Well, I don't give a shit, right?

2892
05:16:30,479 --> 05:16:34,740
But here's what scares me.

2893
05:16:34,740 --> 05:16:36,939
With an automatic payment coming out of my bank account

2894
05:16:36,939 --> 05:16:44,029
of more than $20,000 a month, that would give me anxiety.

2895
05:16:44,029 --> 05:16:47,639
20,000 automatic payment, right?

2896
05:16:47,639 --> 05:16:50,159
Like if it was like a mortgage or if it was like a rent,

2897
05:16:50,159 --> 05:16:54,240
that scares the shit out of me.

2898
05:16:54,240 --> 05:16:56,560
I would never want an auto payment to be more than

2899
05:16:56,560 --> 05:17:01,159
like a few thousand dollars a month, ever, for any reason.

2900
05:17:01,200 --> 05:17:02,439
I don't care how much money I have.

2901
05:17:02,439 --> 05:17:07,970
That's like terrifying to me.

2902
05:17:07,970 --> 05:17:10,490
In my personal opinion, that I would be scared

2903
05:17:10,490 --> 05:17:12,130
of that much money coming out of my checking account

2904
05:17:12,130 --> 05:17:28,560
on an automatic basis.

2905
05:17:28,560 --> 05:17:35,459
Well, you can afford the long check-in, yeah.

2906
05:17:35,459 --> 05:17:45,159
Just don't check your balance.

2907
05:17:45,159 --> 05:17:50,939
If you had that much, just put it towards the house.

2908
05:17:50,939 --> 05:17:53,500
Yeah, I don't know if I would rent for that much.

2909
05:17:53,500 --> 05:17:54,740
That's a lot of money.

2910
05:17:57,950 --> 05:17:59,909
That's a huge amount of money for rent.

2911
05:18:10,729 --> 05:18:12,810
Can you really kill this guy?

2912
05:18:12,810 --> 05:18:16,139
Shut up!

2913
05:18:16,139 --> 05:18:19,729
Sorry, I got a bit overexcited.

2914
05:18:19,729 --> 05:18:20,729
Listen, Damon.

2915
05:18:20,729 --> 05:18:21,889
I love that underwear he has.

2916
05:18:21,889 --> 05:18:23,130
This is a game.

2917
05:18:23,130 --> 05:18:25,569
Unless someone shows up to challenge me,

2918
05:18:25,569 --> 05:18:28,009
the game doesn't work.

2919
05:18:28,009 --> 05:18:30,090
Your guest has arrived.

2920
05:18:30,090 --> 05:18:32,409
Missed their vanishing point.

2921
05:18:32,409 --> 05:18:34,009
Good, let him in.

2922
05:18:34,009 --> 05:18:34,849
All right.

2923
05:18:35,729 --> 05:18:37,090
RGB underwear.

2924
05:18:49,259 --> 05:18:50,099
Hey, French.

2925
05:18:51,060 --> 05:18:52,930
You killed this guy?

2926
05:18:53,689 --> 05:18:54,849
Hell yeah.

2927
05:18:54,849 --> 05:18:56,889
Who do you think you're talking to?

2928
05:18:56,889 --> 05:18:58,930
You seem confident enough.

2929
05:18:58,930 --> 05:19:00,250
Just watch me.

2930
05:19:00,250 --> 05:19:02,529
I'm gonna kill the shit out of you.

2931
05:19:02,529 --> 05:19:04,250
Show me a good time.

2932
05:19:04,250 --> 05:19:06,409
Anything you say, Prince.

2933
05:19:06,409 --> 05:19:07,250
Nice.

2934
05:19:14,840 --> 05:19:17,229
Love how every episode starts.

2935
05:19:17,229 --> 05:19:19,110
Just going to the throne room.

2936
05:19:19,110 --> 05:19:20,750
Just see this weird back and forth

2937
05:19:20,750 --> 05:19:22,709
between the new weird character

2938
05:19:22,709 --> 05:19:29,490
that's being introduced.

2939
05:19:29,490 --> 05:19:45,380
They are giving off a second life DBZ universe, aren't they?

2940
05:19:46,630 --> 05:19:47,869
Let's get to the save point.

2941
05:19:47,869 --> 05:19:49,069
If there's another cutscene, we'll watch it

2942
05:19:49,069 --> 05:19:51,069
and then we're gonna pick it up tomorrow.

2943
05:20:06,740 --> 05:20:13,270
That's it.

2944
05:20:13,270 --> 05:20:14,909
Got some new clothes.

2945
05:20:14,909 --> 05:20:19,220
New T-shirt.

2946
05:20:19,220 --> 05:20:20,540
Play with Gene and then I'm gonna save it

2947
05:20:20,540 --> 05:20:22,860
and we'll pick it up tomorrow.

2948
05:20:27,950 --> 05:20:29,790
Thanks for watching, everybody.

2949
05:20:29,790 --> 05:20:31,979
We'll see you tomorrow.

2950
05:20:31,979 --> 05:20:40,270
Around the same time, around four o'clock.

2951
05:20:40,270 --> 05:20:41,990
We definitely did not get halfway through the game,

2952
05:20:41,990 --> 05:20:44,709
but I think this game's amazing.

2953
05:20:44,709 --> 05:20:47,720
I'm having a ton of fun with it.

2954
05:20:47,720 --> 05:20:52,860
So I, if this has to be like three streams, that's fine.

2955
05:20:52,860 --> 05:20:54,259
We'll do one tomorrow and see how we feel

2956
05:20:54,259 --> 05:20:56,540
and maybe do another one.

2957
05:20:56,540 --> 05:20:59,479
If not, then we'll pick it up like,

2958
05:20:59,479 --> 05:21:00,439
but here's the thing.

2959
05:21:00,439 --> 05:21:03,259
I'm gonna be staying on the Switch

2960
05:21:03,259 --> 05:21:06,840
because yeah, this will work out fine.

2961
05:21:06,840 --> 05:21:08,700
So we're gonna stream tomorrow

2962
05:21:08,700 --> 05:21:11,599
and then however, wherever we get tomorrow,

2963
05:21:11,599 --> 05:21:13,880
on the 10th, the new WarioWare comes out.

2964
05:21:13,880 --> 05:21:15,400
You better believe I'm gonna play the absolute hell

2965
05:21:15,400 --> 05:21:17,220
out of that on Friday.

2966
05:21:17,220 --> 05:21:19,590
So maybe we could do like a Friday, Saturday,

2967
05:21:19,630 --> 05:21:22,389
which would be, or Friday, Sunday or something,

2968
05:21:22,389 --> 05:21:26,169
which would be WarioWare and then I'll finish No More Heroes.

2969
05:21:26,169 --> 05:21:33,110
I think that'll work out perfectly.

2970
05:21:33,110 --> 05:21:34,349
So let's pick it up.

2971
05:21:34,349 --> 05:21:38,610
I'm gonna be exactly where I'm standing right now.

2972
05:21:38,610 --> 05:21:42,990
We'll check it out tomorrow.

2973
05:21:42,990 --> 05:21:45,900
Sims 3, Sims 3 will be probably another week or two.

2974
05:21:45,900 --> 05:21:48,490
I wanna play WarioWare.

2975
05:21:48,490 --> 05:21:50,569
So I have all the mods done.

2976
05:21:50,569 --> 05:21:51,409
They're all installed.

2977
05:21:51,409 --> 05:21:52,229
They're ready to go.

2978
05:21:52,229 --> 05:21:59,709
I just have to do it.

2979
05:21:59,709 --> 05:22:05,860
I got like seven mods installed and they're all insane.

2980
05:22:05,860 --> 05:22:08,119
Thanks for watching, everybody.

2981
05:22:08,119 --> 05:22:09,240
There was a lot of community subs.

2982
05:22:09,240 --> 05:22:11,119
Oh, the sunflowers, yes.

2983
05:22:11,159 --> 05:22:15,470
There will be a sunflower reveal tomorrow.

2984
05:22:15,470 --> 05:22:24,290
You better believe it.

2985
05:22:24,290 --> 05:22:25,650
Yeah, there were a lot of community subs.

2986
05:22:25,650 --> 05:22:28,090
There was like 50 community subs given

2987
05:22:28,090 --> 05:22:31,520
in like 10, 10, 10, 10.

2988
05:22:31,520 --> 05:22:34,759
When I looked at the sub count after the all-house stream,

2989
05:22:34,759 --> 05:22:40,770
I remember, I did not think it was gonna be that high.

2990
05:22:40,770 --> 05:22:44,189
We have smashed every record I ever held on this channel

2991
05:22:44,189 --> 05:22:51,509
for subscriptions.

2992
05:22:51,509 --> 05:22:53,740
It's quite a lot.

2993
05:22:53,740 --> 05:22:55,540
The record of the channel was,

2994
05:22:55,540 --> 05:22:57,970
and I'll be upfront with you,

2995
05:22:57,970 --> 05:23:02,389
record of the channel was 12,800 subscriptions.

2996
05:23:02,389 --> 05:23:05,310
Now, I know that this is not gonna be this high

2997
05:23:05,310 --> 05:23:07,779
probably in 30 days from now,

2998
05:23:07,779 --> 05:23:08,619
but this is, like I said,

2999
05:23:08,619 --> 05:23:11,409
I'm gonna be chasing highs for the rest of my life.

3000
05:23:11,409 --> 05:23:16,110
100K viewers, like all this shit that had a lot of people.

3001
05:23:16,110 --> 05:23:18,450
I think the peak the day after the stream

3002
05:23:18,450 --> 05:23:21,650
was about 17,400 subscriptions,

3003
05:23:21,650 --> 05:23:24,529
which is like, are you kidding me?

3004
05:23:24,529 --> 05:23:27,630
I do not expect that to continue

3005
05:23:27,630 --> 05:23:29,189
because obviously a lot of that might be just people

3006
05:23:29,189 --> 05:23:31,630
that primed or that gave during the stream,

3007
05:23:31,630 --> 05:23:33,069
whatever that stream,

3008
05:23:33,069 --> 05:23:37,060
but that's 20k rent money.

3009
05:23:37,060 --> 05:23:39,900
Targeting network.

3010
05:23:41,930 --> 05:23:48,119
Yeah, it's, I can't, it's insane.

3011
05:23:48,119 --> 05:23:52,259
So, regardless if we stay up here at this,

3012
05:23:52,259 --> 05:23:54,180
and I'm saying we, right?

3013
05:23:54,180 --> 05:23:56,060
But you know what I mean.

3014
05:23:56,060 --> 05:24:02,229
Regardless if 17,000 subs is the highest it ever goes ever,

3015
05:24:02,229 --> 05:24:05,000
and we pull back quite a bit maybe,

3016
05:24:05,000 --> 05:24:08,169
that's an achievement that I never thought I'd see.

3017
05:24:08,169 --> 05:24:09,569
We, I mean, do you remember like a year ago

3018
05:24:09,569 --> 05:24:11,990
during one of the,

3019
05:24:11,990 --> 05:24:14,009
I think it was the New Year's Eve stream,

3020
05:24:14,009 --> 05:24:17,459
I broke 10,000 subs for the first time.

3021
05:24:17,459 --> 05:24:20,360
When I went to bed that night,

3022
05:24:21,299 --> 05:24:22,139
I was like, this is,

3023
05:24:22,139 --> 05:24:23,650
I'm never crossing this ever again.

3024
05:24:23,650 --> 05:24:24,650
I remember just like lying in bed,

3025
05:24:24,650 --> 05:24:25,770
just staring at the ceiling being like,

3026
05:24:25,770 --> 05:24:28,159
this is never happening again.

3027
05:24:28,159 --> 05:24:33,610
There's no way I stay over that.

3028
05:24:33,610 --> 05:24:37,319
I am, I know I'm saying that again right now.

3029
05:24:37,319 --> 05:24:38,700
Parasocial Andy.

3030
05:24:42,509 --> 05:24:49,400
But I get, I don't know, just thanks.

3031
05:24:49,400 --> 05:24:51,360
Hopefully I can spend the money well

3032
05:24:51,360 --> 05:24:55,599
and not on, not on that insane rent.

3033
05:24:55,599 --> 05:24:57,840
Don't worry.

3034
05:24:57,840 --> 05:25:06,950
Just do dollhouse quality streams every day.

3035
05:25:06,950 --> 05:25:09,709
No, I just, I don't want people to think

3036
05:25:09,709 --> 05:25:12,659
I'm trying to be like, look at how many subs I have now.

3037
05:25:12,659 --> 05:25:14,220
I just, it's a bit shocking

3038
05:25:14,220 --> 05:25:16,099
that this many people would even do it in the first place.

3039
05:25:16,099 --> 05:25:20,380
So, cause I talked about it before

3040
05:25:20,380 --> 05:25:21,900
and I kind of would like to be

3041
05:25:21,900 --> 05:25:25,380
a little more transparent about it.

3042
05:25:25,380 --> 05:25:32,970
I wouldn't like hide it or anything, but thank you.

3043
05:25:32,970 --> 05:25:34,090
We'll see where it goes.

3044
05:25:34,090 --> 05:25:38,069
Let's see what streams can happen

3045
05:25:38,069 --> 05:25:40,459
because of different opportunities, right?

3046
05:25:40,459 --> 05:25:43,470
The more money that I make, the more I'm going to use.

3047
05:25:43,470 --> 05:25:45,169
And we've had sponsors,

3048
05:25:45,169 --> 05:25:47,669
we've had involvement from Twitch, right?

3049
05:25:47,669 --> 05:25:48,509
So I don't know.

3050
05:25:48,509 --> 05:25:50,069
I'm hoping to continue to do stuff

3051
05:25:50,069 --> 05:25:51,229
like you saw a couple of weeks ago,

3052
05:25:51,229 --> 05:25:54,939
the last week or whatever.

3053
05:25:54,939 --> 05:25:59,959
Let's give it a shot.

3054
05:25:59,959 --> 05:26:00,799
Yeah, we'll see you tomorrow.

3055
05:26:00,799 --> 05:26:02,080
Thanks for watching everybody.

3056
05:26:02,080 --> 05:26:03,279
Have a great rest of your night.

3057
05:26:03,279 --> 05:26:05,560
It's probably pretty late for a lot of you

3058
05:26:05,560 --> 05:26:11,720
considering it's 9.30 PST right now, or PT, whatever.

3059
05:26:11,720 --> 05:26:13,049
See you tomorrow.

3060
05:26:13,049 --> 05:26:14,709
Good night, guys.

3061
05:26:14,709 --> 05:27:01,290
Take care of yourselves.
