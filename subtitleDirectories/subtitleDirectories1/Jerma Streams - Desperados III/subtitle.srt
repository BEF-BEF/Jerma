1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:06,219
It's been a long time coming. We've been waiting for this one.

2
00:00:06,219 --> 00:00:12,710
Desperados 3. Launched on Steam. And I'm gonna play it the day that it launches.

3
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:17,609
I've been talking about this shit for like at least a week or two.

4
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:25,739
Man, it's not like I've ever done that before. Talking about Half-Life Alyx for about six months.

5
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:32,759
We've been waiting for this one though, except not really at all.

6
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:40,979
I played Desperados 2 and I made a video on Desperados 2 for those that do not know.

7
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:45,659
It's pretty fun. It's pretty crazy. They made another one.

8
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:53,689
So I'm gonna play it. Zero viewers. No viewers. Omega Low. Yeah, all right.

9
00:00:53,689 --> 00:01:01,100
Well, uh, whatever. I'm okay with zero viewers. You know why?

10
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:06,390
Because that's an fucking infinite number. It's a never-ending circle.

11
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:17,959
There is an infinite amount of you here. Zero is infinity.

12
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:22,230
Oh wait, no. Infinity is like eight, right? All right.

13
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,950
Let's have eight viewers because that's like the infinity symbol.

14
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:37,480
Let's have eight. Zero is infinity. No, zero is. That means no one.

15
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,540
What does the infinite symbol look like? It's like an eight, right?

16
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:49,239
The infinity symbol. What is it? Why is this not the first?

17
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:51,959
Yeah, it's a sideways. Okay. It's like a pair of goggles.

18
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:57,340
It's an eight. That's an eight. That's an eight sideways.

19
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,459
It's an eight lined out. That's fine. Hey, thank you Game Watch.

20
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:08,250
The 10 community subs. Appreciate it. Thank you Game Watch.

21
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,710
10 fucking subs just came in. A lot of money. Thank you.

22
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:22,379
You're playing Doritos 3. That would be weird if this was Doritos characters.

23
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:29,210
Doritos doesn't even have characters. They never did that. They never tried that.

24
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,840
All Doritos characters were just way too enthusiastic adults giving their children

25
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:43,050
junk food or stealing the junk food from their children. That's pretty much all they've done.

26
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:54,729
The Doritos bag is the character. Oh yeah. Didn't it like tilt around?

27
00:02:54,729 --> 00:02:59,449
It wasn't like, hey kids, it's been a while. Doritos. They moved around, right?

28
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:05,669
They did that. The Doritos bag like tilted and it didn't have a mouth, but it talked, right?

29
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:16,229
In like one commercial? No, really? No, it definitely did.

30
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:19,590
Somebody said that in chat. I distinctly remember it happening.

31
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:24,090
I never said anything like that. Creep. Why are you calling me a creep?

32
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,009
Because I misplaced a Doritos ad. Therefore, I'm a creep.

33
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,300
What was that Doritos commercial? Oh yeah. It was like a Doritos bag.

34
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:46,300
Yeah. Doritos are really just tasty. You creep. Get away from me. Don't look at him.

35
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:56,419
Go this way everybody. Dairy. We only eat, we only eat Teddy's natural corn chips.

36
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:05,780
You fucking disgusting creepy. All right. We have a game to play. We're

37
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:11,530
going to play Desperados 3. We only drink peanut butter oil. I'm, I can't, I'm,

38
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:17,529
I'm still angry about that. Ask pre stream chat. I was still angry about that today.

39
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:24,410
I was being told that peanut butter was unhealthy and I gave everybody detention in pre stream chat.

40
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,629
Because if you think that peanut butter is an unhealthy snack, then your teachers are

41
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:37,370
fucking aliens and they're giving you an alien learning book. It's not, it is not,

42
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:43,660
it's unbelievable to hear that. You guys need a nutrition lesson. Okay. Real peanut butter,

43
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:50,329
not like the shit with like 30 grams of Coca-Cola sugar soda put in it. I'm talking about real

44
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:58,339
peanut butter. It's no sugar added. It's got so many delicious, healthy fats. It's got fiber.

45
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:02,860
It's got protein. You know, if you got like locked in a basement, like let's say, let's say,

46
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,579
let's say there's like an absolute destruction of the earth and you're downstairs in somebody's

47
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:13,480
bunker and it's walls of peanut butter, you can stay alive until while that peanut butter is gone.

48
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,509
It's a goddamn complete food. It's got your protein. It's got your fat. It's got your

49
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:20,470
carbohydrates. It's got your fiber. You could live if peanut butter is a superfood, you could

50
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:29,829
live out of it. It's true. Thank you. I want to VIP that person for an hour. For some reason,

51
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,670
when I bring up the word peanut butter, people think I'm like eating cotton candy out of the

52
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:39,290
bag before you turn it into cotton candy. Like I'm just eating cotton candy sugar. That's like

53
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:46,230
what I'm telling people apparently. Holy shit, dude. You eat like a whole tub of ice cream.

54
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:54,019
No, I like peanut butter. That's the same thing. I mean, I like cookies and cream. Ben and Jerry's

55
00:05:54,019 --> 00:06:02,220
like the rest of us, man, but I don't, you eat the whole, the whole tub. No, I like peanut butter.

56
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:11,370
I love peanut butter. It's like my favorite thing ever. Do a peanut butter stream right now. I'll

57
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:18,860
tell you. You go, if you guys have like a Whole Foods around you, it's so simple. It's basic. It's

58
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:28,920
so easy. The 365, just default Whole Foods brand 365 creamy peanut butter on the shelf. Go get it.

59
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:35,319
You can always tell because it's the one with the, it's the one with the oil on top. Get that one.

60
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:38,740
Get that one and just do, just do it and just eat it a little bit. Just put some, put it on a

61
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:44,420
fucking piece of celery. Dip your pretzels in it. Put it on like a toast and just please trust me

62
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:54,660
on this. You have to trust me. Not as healthy as, yeah, we went by too fast. I don't even know what

63
00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:09,639
you said. He's the peanut butter guy. Pure peanut oil is not good for you. I don't know why you guys

64
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:15,720
get this misconception that I'm telling you to like put it in an IV bag and put it in, drain peanut

65
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:28,259
oil into your veins. But it's, peanut butter is a good snack. All right, let's play. I'm going to,

66
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:32,740
at some point during this stream, remind me, we're going to go over my food pyramid.

67
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:36,660
I'm making a food pyramid for you guys because I think a lot of you guys might have a little bit

68
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:43,959
of unhealthy, unhealthy, non-nutritional shit in your life. I'm not doing hard. I'm so glad

69
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:52,180
he can't even pick anything other than normal. He's got a nut addiction. He nuts are great.

70
00:07:52,899 --> 00:08:00,019
Sunflower seeds, peanuts, walnuts, almonds. If you're not allergic to them, eat them. I got so many

71
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:07,660
good things in them. All right. I, I, I'm just, I'm not going to do, what is it? Beginner or this

72
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:19,769
one's on fire. I don't like this one. There's a hard and then there's a super hard. It requires

73
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:23,769
perfect planning and execution. Enemies have lightning reflexes. Characters have almost no

74
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:28,660
health and ammo. This is not recommended for a first playthrough, regardless of player skill.

75
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:35,429
Recommended for veterans of the real time tactic genre, not me. We're going to stay on normal.

76
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:44,259
Thank you. I'm not doing super hard. I've learned my lesson. I can't do that anymore.

77
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:48,200
I can't just fucking pick the hardest difficulty for a joke for 10 minutes and then we have to

78
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,320
restart the stream. I don't want to, I'm not doing that. I'm not that guy anymore.

79
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:59,740
That's all you guys want. You want me to get destroyed for like 30 minutes and then, you know,

80
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,559
I'm going to turn it off and turn it back on again on normal. We're skipping that part.

81
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:23,850
Fod watchers, you don't have to do anything. Stay here. It's really low. This is a lot of audio.

82
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:39,049
So low. He chugged peanut. Guys, I would, I will eat at least five or six full spoonfuls of

83
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:44,490
peanut butter on stream. That's normal to me. That's not abnormal. That's not like, oh, I will

84
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:53,059
do that and it'll be fine. That's like a routine. Johnny, you're straggling. Come on. Right behind

85
00:09:53,059 --> 00:10:01,750
you, pa. Eat a whole jar. No, that's now you're good. Now that's unhealthy. Now that's not good

86
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:12,600
for you. I'm going on ahead. You follow and keep your head down. Let's get like a top down red dead

87
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,720
redemption too. Yes, sir. Which one am I? Wait, that's me. That's, that's the guy from the second

88
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:30,899
game, right? Sly Cooper. Come on. Somebody said it in pre-stream. Somebody said Sly Cooper in

89
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:37,340
pre-stream chat and it's stuck in my brain. All right. Move. I got this. All right. That's pretty

90
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:44,980
responsive. Move camera mouse. Right. W A S D does not move the camera. Okay. I can hold middle mouse

91
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:52,100
button just like every RTS. Okay. Right on my way. Where am I going? Drink out of the water.

92
00:10:52,899 --> 00:11:06,860
Ooh, wait. Is there a, there's a super zoom and I tilt. Ooh. Cool. Sure thing. I'm going to get so

93
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:20,940
fucking killed. All right. Crouch. Son man. Okay. Crouch. It's now or never. Use. Use control.

94
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:31,590
Am I using? Control. I'm ready this time. Use control. On my way. Display view come.

95
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:42,470
Display view come. They found us. Stop. What the hell happened? Sorry. I slipped up.

96
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:52,649
Thank God. Thank God I'm here with my friend. Okay. Why does it say use control? What does it

97
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:57,289
for? What control? I can't use anything. Oh, you have to hold it and then grab. Okay.

98
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:05,139
He came in and threw a knife at the guy's neck. If an enemy sees you in their view cone,

99
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:09,460
if the enemy sees you, the view cone fills with yellow, right? It's like metal gear solid.

100
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:13,059
If the yellow reaches you, the enemy detects you start attacking and sounding alarms. Yeah. Yeah.

101
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:20,309
Yeah. So just like it's metal gear solid too. There it is. Like, which there he is. Right. Okay.

102
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:25,990
There's the first guard. I need to be sneaky about this. Leave it to me. Okay. First guard.

103
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:36,730
Can I loot this guy? Is it time? Sure. Let's go. All right. Let's go. Crouch. On my way.

104
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:41,500
Okay. Quick save. Thank God. There's a quick save. You can save the game at any time.

105
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,259
I'm pressing F5. Quick load by pressing F8. F8. Okay. I'm going to be using this all the time.

106
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:57,529
F5 and F8. Hey, thank you. Sly Cuper for the 10 subs. Thanks for the 10 subs. Sly Cuper.

107
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:05,379
Use it often. Failing and retrying is intended and part of the game. F5 and F8. Okay. F5.

108
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:12,549
All right. Good. Last save one. Is that going to keep, is that going to stay there? Sure.

109
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:22,100
Sure. Let's go. Copper can throw a coin to distract enemies with the blue radius.

110
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:32,330
Press E then press L and mouse. Sure. I'll throw one of my coins. Good idea.

111
00:13:32,409 --> 00:13:37,450
Get him to turn his head. I'll do the rest. Okay. If eventually this is a brick,

112
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,450
then I think a lot of you guys need to pay more attention.

113
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,850
Need some change? You hear that? Let's go. I'll get it done.

114
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:51,769
Wait. Hey. Why are you so much better than me? Remember. Think slow. Act fast.

115
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:55,370
Last save thing? You always hide the body. Why do I have to constantly count things up?

116
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:05,529
Right. On my way. To hide the body? All right. Now what? Follow me. Keep your head down.

117
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:10,149
Catch up to your father. Oh, he's my dad. Okay. It's now or never.

118
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:20,730
Shout out. Showdown mode. Shift. I got this. This might be fun. Incoming dead dad.

119
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:33,639
No, they're not going to do that in this game. Showdown mode pauses the game and lets you plan

120
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:39,240
one action per character. Okay. You can execute actions right away or save them for a later time

121
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,740
for a shift into showdown mode. So it's a pause. Then you can just go, all right,

122
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,740
I want to do this. I'm going to do that. I'll do that. Okay. Let's do showdown mode.

123
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:52,730
Don't come to me. I'm just standing. Showdown. Throw coin at horse.

124
00:14:53,830 --> 00:15:00,919
E. One fake coin. Leave it to me. Coin at horse. Continue. Execute order.

125
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:13,779
All right. Do it again. She wants to still have plenty of money on my way. Execute.

126
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:24,860
Okay. Why don't you just throw knives at people, dude? You just like, I don't get it. Sure thing.

127
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:29,340
Wait, is this person unconscious? Hey, pa. Yeah. How many men does Frank have?

128
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:33,100
Doesn't matter, boy. What are you doing? One on one. You always got a chance.

129
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:41,909
You just got to thin out the pack. Okay. Safe. Sure. Let's go. Knife camera.

130
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:48,870
Locked. No surprise there. Distract the guard. Anger the horse.

131
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:55,509
All right, son. Time for a challenge. See that ladder up there? I need you to throw it down for

132
00:15:55,509 --> 00:16:02,809
me. Okay. Mouse wheel zoom and get it. Sure. No problem. Oh, thank God. He knows where to go.

133
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:07,059
I would have walked around in circles and everyone would have been like, oh my God,

134
00:16:07,059 --> 00:16:10,500
he's pretty, he doesn't know what he's pretending. I don't even have to pretend.

135
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:17,299
I can just play. Oh, you'd have a double tap. Cool. I got this. I knock it down.

136
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:25,850
It's going to be an acting screen. Good job. That's my boy. It was easy.

137
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:34,220
Somebody's getting $50. All right. Him times gave 5,000 bits. Thanks to the $50 and they do

138
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:39,340
the, they say, mwah, the French champagne. Always been celebrated for its excellence.

139
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:43,899
Leave it in your head. They start with the interruptions. Stay cool. Hey, thank you for

140
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:51,080
the, that's a $50 interruption. Thank you. Well, crouched space. You can safely move through the

141
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:59,000
dark striped area of enemy's view cans while scrouched on a roof. I can't even read anymore.

142
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:07,240
What's going on? I'm only 34. What's happening? This doesn't, this is stupid. Why? I used to be

143
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:16,819
able to read anything. Why did I add an S? You're always hit into guards as long as you stay in the

144
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:26,420
darker area. Okay. Yeah, I know. Quick save. He's only 34 and he's like, you can't even read anymore.

145
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:32,839
You've got to find a way to sneak through. Oh yeah. He was crushed. Okay. You cone.

146
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:40,440
All right. We've got an area here. We've got to go this way. I'll get it done.

147
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,759
That explains why the old bastard has it in for her. It's now or never. You're a view cone.

148
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:52,519
I've got to go down here. Wait, can I just walk across? It's not going to, it has to turn yellow,

149
00:17:52,519 --> 00:18:00,789
right? I should go this way. I can climb up this. I'm going to go for it. Here we go.

150
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:07,420
Her only friend is his bottle. Sure. Let's go. This dude's face is way too small for his skull.

151
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:16,410
Right on my way. Oh, stop. Stop. My money'd be on Hutch. How can I get up there? Quick too.

152
00:18:17,369 --> 00:18:21,769
Leave it to me. Something. Ah, I found you. Fuck.

153
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:41,700
Dad, dad. All right. Let's go. So what have to go? How do I go around that then? Sure.

154
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:48,630
Roach. You've got to find a way to sneak through. Okay. So did this person turn?

155
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:52,069
Wait, I forgot the coin. I have the coin. Here we go. Ready?

156
00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:03,769
There was something on my way. All right. Can they see that? Can they look above?

157
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:08,579
Save, save, save, save, save. They can't look.

158
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:22,410
And nowhere. Where are they going? Are they going up the stairs?

159
00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:33,019
I don't know. We're good. Oh, you want to go up there? Okay. Let's go up there together.

160
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:42,180
See the one in the back near the cliff? Find a way to distract him with your coming.

161
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:49,160
Then I can take them both out. Okay. One fake coin coming up.

162
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:59,140
The other one, John. We'll get him. He's not looking. How far can I throw? Still got plenty left.

163
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:12,519
How far can I throw this? Leave it to me. Oh, shit. I knock him out. Hey. On my way. One fake coin

164
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:18,279
coming up. What's that noise? Sure. The other one, John. I'm working on it. Hold on. I don't think

165
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:27,240
he's going to be able to get down here. Oh, sure thing. Still got plenty left. Need some change.

166
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:43,289
All right. Go get him, dad. He's still breathing. Tie him up and quick before he comes to.

167
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:51,210
What? What do you mean tie him up? How do I tie him up? Oh, shit. There's a tutorial. He left a note

168
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:56,500
for me to tell me how. You can hide bodies in bushes. Houses and other places. Hold control

169
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,220
then press left mouse to pick up a body. Hold control and press left mouse to drop a body.

170
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:15,289
Okay. Don't mind me. Good job. Now hide him in the bushes. Am I too weak to pick him up?

171
00:21:16,089 --> 00:21:33,269
Look at this. Atta boy. Let's go. Sure. No problem. Right. On my way. Where is he? Where'd he go?

172
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:40,500
He did a full swan dive. It's now or never. We got to get moving.

173
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:50,460
Rotate camera. Hold on. Yes. I will. On my way. That was fucking crazy. Holy shit. I don't know

174
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:55,819
that was going to happen. How am I still? Okay. I did good. Browse. Where'd they all come from?

175
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:01,980
You got her. See that crane up there? Yeah. How about you go over there and make a delivery?

176
00:22:02,859 --> 00:22:06,539
Coming right up, sir. I have to stand up and be like I have to wait. How do I do that?

177
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:18,309
They're looking in every direction. Sure. Let's go. The hell? How do I get up there?

178
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:27,400
Glad I picked up these. Forget it. That's nothing. Sure thing. Son of a bitch.

179
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:34,759
Transmit. I got you. Spread out. Let's take him down. Why would he run up there?

180
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:41,940
Dad died. Dad died. How about you go over there and make a delivery?

181
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:51,099
Coming right up, sir. Forget it. That's nothing. Oh shit. There's bushes on my way. Excuse me,

182
00:22:51,099 --> 00:23:03,960
dad. Leave it to me. Glad I picked up these. Son of a bitch. Stop. Let's take him down, boys.

183
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:13,099
All right, guys. Let's smoke him out. If I make a mistake and try to run away,

184
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:21,670
dad just goes, oh no, son. I'm going to run into all of them and die. No. That crane up there?

185
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:25,910
Yeah. How about you go over there and make a delivery? No, my son. Coming right up, sir.

186
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:29,829
Dad died. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. We get it. Glad I picked up these. Yeah,

187
00:23:29,829 --> 00:23:36,630
the dad died. Sure thing. Okay. I'm hidden in the bush. I'm going to climb up that.

188
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:50,630
One fake coin. Coming up. This way. Come on. Turn around. I got this. Good. Nice. All right.

189
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:57,289
Nobody up here? Leave it to me. Is it time? Okay. You can highlight all interactable objects

190
00:23:57,289 --> 00:24:02,579
if you press H. Wow. That's really useful. Okay. Cool. I have to go over there and drop

191
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:12,200
that on those guys. This is a bird's nest. It's now or never. It's in there. Oh, okay.

192
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:23,269
So if I drop down here. Hitman looks a lot different than I remember. It does. Sure.

193
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:32,660
Let's go. What's that? Oh, that's going in here. I don't want to do that.

194
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:46,230
Holy shit. That was kind of brutal. Nice job, son. Now stay right there. I'll come to you.

195
00:24:46,309 --> 00:24:53,660
Come on up here, dad. Non-descript civilian, 10 subs. There's a lot of fucking subs today.

196
00:24:54,460 --> 00:25:02,200
It's like 40. Jesus. Good job, boy. You know the drill. You wait till I'm back. Here he comes.

197
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:07,369
Here comes the dad. I don't hear it.

198
00:25:07,369 --> 00:25:12,390
So the same thing last time. Why can't I come with you? Just give me a gun.

199
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:19,259
A gun, huh? By the way, I want to tell you something. I got something real important to

200
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:23,660
tell you when I get back. I want to see the main part of the story. 15 paces.

201
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:41,049
Hit this? What? Oh, you get guns in this game? NA aim. Sorry, sorry, son. I've spent too much

202
00:25:41,049 --> 00:25:55,500
time online. When you pull that off, you're ready for a gun. See you later, Johnny.

203
00:25:56,059 --> 00:26:07,220
Do I have to sit here and practice until I get it? I'm aiming at it. We're going to get a

204
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:10,900
transition into him having a beard and being like presumably 20 years older.

205
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:16,440
Because anytime you get a beard, it means you aged at least 25 years.

206
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:37,849
He's gonna get it right when they pull all the way back. Oh, if only the characters could do a

207
00:26:37,849 --> 00:27:01,849
backflip. All right. Okay. Loading. Look at these loading times. Oh, yeah. A broadcaster.

208
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:14,539
Nice. This grenades. This is probably grenades.

209
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:21,819
Big Ann. It's like a shootout. Do I get to actually use a gun?

210
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:34,339
Come on. Let's show them who's boss. Yeah. Take cover. Brain robbery. Come this way. Let's flank

211
00:27:34,339 --> 00:27:56,950
him. Holy shit. Who's doing that? That's insane aim. Don't let him get away. Is this me? No.

212
00:27:59,029 --> 00:28:10,660
These people even have weapons? Well, this is not good. Another notch for Big Ann.

213
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:20,500
Hey, Lisa for me. This is a huge train. This is the biggest train I've ever seen in my life.

214
00:28:27,099 --> 00:28:41,450
Rocky Mountains, Colorado. You're a city slicker. Am I? It's both huge. I wonder what's in here.

215
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:44,890
The train was so long that I feel like if the train crashed, it would take like

216
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:59,589
four hours before we even figured it out back here. Something tells me you ain't here punching

217
00:28:59,589 --> 00:29:07,019
tickets. There he is. Is he a beard? Kinda. Seems like we made an unplanned stop. Kinda.

218
00:29:07,019 --> 00:29:17,589
I'd better go find out what's holding this up. OK. I have a weapon. This game's kind of fun.

219
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:22,150
I have to sneak my way up to the front of the train. I have a knife? Holy shit. I can stab people.

220
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:27,029
All right. Hold on. This game's fun. OK. Anything else over here? Wait, what about you?

221
00:29:28,069 --> 00:29:44,150
And up on my way. Hurry up. I'm so glad you could do that.

222
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:50,890
OK, here we go. Knife knockout. You can take down enemies up close using your knife.

223
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:55,529
We'll knock them out. Press Q to select the knife, then L to attack. For a knockout,

224
00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:02,069
swap out the skill in the skill bar. I mean, a knockout. Let's make it quick. You fucking serious?

225
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:18,339
No, I'm not knocking him out. He's got a gun. Can I pick up that gun? OK. Nice knockout.

226
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:27,589
Why would I knock him out? I'm fucking desperado. Throwing knife. Koopa can throw his knife to take

227
00:30:27,589 --> 00:30:33,539
down enemies from afar. He needs to retrieve it afterwards. This is awesome. Press W to select

228
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:48,220
throwing knife and throw it with L. I have to get the knife. Oh shit. Let's knock this guy out.

229
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:10,230
Oh shit. That guy had a shovel. That guy had a shovel. All right. That guy was always going to

230
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:17,859
give me the shovel. Got to go. Got to go. Got to go. Got to go. This guy's going to wake up. Throw

231
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:37,990
him. OK, he's dead. Give me the knife. You're ignoring that. Put a face cam on the portrait.

232
00:31:39,349 --> 00:31:43,589
No, I'm naked. I can't do that. David.

233
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:55,460
Shall we? No, I'm not going to put casino ink on the portrait. No, no. Hold on. Hold on.

234
00:31:55,460 --> 00:32:04,069
You said you bought a cowboy costume. Do you really think I did that?

235
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:14,900
Jesus, you scared me. Don't hurt him. Let's get going. Here, have a coin. I just need a few

236
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:23,980
seconds. Fuck. You say what the fuck? Because I gave him a coin. Koopa can use his revolvers to

237
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:31,140
take down guards. Guns are loud and will alarm guards not hear them? Oh shit. OK, what? I have

238
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:43,910
two different kinds of guns. Here he comes. I'm doing tricks. Shoot him. I did a trick and he

239
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:55,880
didn't shoot him. First the trick button. There's got to be another way. No, I don't have a cowboy

240
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:03,579
costume. I made that up. Jesus, you scared me. Can you help us? Where's he looking? Over there.

241
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:12,779
He doesn't see you over here. Let's take out the new model army. Remington model. Or the old 51.

242
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:26,039
Did you get him? Oh shit. He sees me. Give me more time. How many bullets can this thing hold?

243
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:33,980
What's that? Don't look for you. I just used the other gun. Thank you, stranger. Give me money to

244
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:44,660
hide. I don't want to shoot them. How do I put this away? Come on. OK, that's good. Who cares

245
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:58,019
about lifting them up? Where'd they go? Where'd they go? Did they jump off? It's now or never.

246
00:33:58,019 --> 00:34:06,730
Next time I better thin down the pack before I get loud. I fell. And no, I'm going to play this like

247
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:12,679
I play every game that's like Hitman. Try to sneak in, get stopped at the front door,

248
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:21,719
and then just shoot them all. Anything we might regret was this. Well, now maybe throw a grenade

249
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:31,750
or two. So should I sneak over here? I feel like this is a character I want to keep. Not a problem.

250
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:39,460
Dual shot. You can fire both guns at the same time. You can now choose two targets for Cooper's

251
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:44,099
guns. Oh, that's really odd. That's actually really cool. I'll take them both down at the same

252
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:56,809
time. One, two, execute. Nice. A two headed boy, thanks to the five subs. I'd say you owe me one.

253
00:35:00,619 --> 00:35:15,860
Hey, now, are you kidding me? All right. I'd say we're even now. Identify this. Now I suggest you

254
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:22,119
return to your wagon. I'll handle things from here like you handled those two.

255
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:31,159
Listen, Mr. Cooper, you would recognize your own dad. Mr. Cooper, I've been hired to make

256
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:39,539
sure this train gets to Flagstone. I'd appreciate it if you don't get in my way. Well, now, Mr.

257
00:35:39,619 --> 00:35:44,579
We go like four hours into the game. And he finally talks about how he's like Mr. Cooper.

258
00:35:46,579 --> 00:35:51,139
Oh, shit. Yeah, dad, it is you. Fuck. In a while. How did I not know?

259
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:16,550
You don't typically wear purple. That's a very simple joke.

260
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:20,469
The train stopped. He's going to take some work to clear those rocks.

261
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:26,219
Me a dynamite. You're going to give me dynamite? Yes, you are. Good thing they have a stash of

262
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:33,500
dynamite up on that plateau. Yeah, grab it and clear the tunnel. Not such a bad plan.

263
00:36:34,219 --> 00:36:41,019
I don't do bad plans. Fair enough. Let's get to it then. All right. Sure thing.

264
00:36:41,739 --> 00:36:49,699
I don't understand why people just put this huge stuff like stuffed peppers worth of dynamite.

265
00:36:52,789 --> 00:36:55,909
Why would you do that? Why can't you have like five different barrels? Why does it have to be

266
00:36:55,909 --> 00:37:09,139
stuffed that much shit in it? I don't know. You can throw your bag. Yeah. OK. He has to retrieve

267
00:37:09,139 --> 00:37:17,320
it again. A gas trap blinds enemies who opened the bag. Oh, shit. I have more than one character

268
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:21,880
now. What is this one syringe? Well, the game just got way better.

269
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:28,139
Only temporary. Throw the bag. First enemy to spot it will come for it. If opened, it briefly

270
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:33,820
blinds the target with gas. All right, so we're going to go up here. Wait, we can go two different

271
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:43,619
ways. All right, you go this way. Let's keep moving. You walk across this. Don't get in the way. I'm

272
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:49,460
going to use my bag. You get over there. You just hide and learn something. OK, you go this way.

273
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:55,750
Here it goes. Jump over to the other cart. We're going to do this at the same time. It's going to

274
00:37:55,750 --> 00:38:04,940
be awesome. Oh, I can't. This is a tutorial. Never mind. Someone call for a doctor. Here we go.

275
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:11,400
Gas bag E. Let me take care of that. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

276
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:23,219
I need a coin. I can't throw it. Saved me dozens of time. Who wants to have a look? Hey, OK, then.

277
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:37,860
Bag came out of the bush. It looks like a gas trap. Huh? Not bad. Wait, is he blind?

278
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:44,940
You don't, Mr. Cooper, unless you're me. But can he kill him? Gotta love bandits.

279
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:54,340
Leave their boss to me. I smell trouble. This is our train now. I can handle that. Thank you.

280
00:38:55,579 --> 00:39:00,139
You wasted. Oh, I got it right here. Hold on. Let's throw. OK, we're going to do this.

281
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:09,340
You get it. Then you stab him. No, I'm looking at this. That wasn't there before.

282
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:16,300
Is this guy going to do it again? This guy's got like the mind of a mouse. OK, let's go. Ready?

283
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:22,840
Got him. Fucking teamwork. Perfect.

284
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:34,840
Let's move. Get that bag back. You get it? I just have to walk over it. OK.

285
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:41,110
They work together. Do they walk together or do I have to control them both independently?

286
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:47,530
Bunt line. McCoy can use his bunt line to take down enemies from a long distance if he needs

287
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:56,309
this skill for him. Holy shit. OK, if he needs this skill for a mission, he will carry a final

288
00:39:56,309 --> 00:40:05,289
golden bullet. There's a lookout up on the cliff. I'll take him from here. That I want to see. Well,

289
00:40:05,289 --> 00:40:12,489
I'll be damned. Give him a chance. Bunt line special. Custom stock. Go that far with a weapon

290
00:40:12,489 --> 00:40:22,820
like that. Hurry up. Isn't that a pistol? I'll take him up. Where can I put him? On my way.

291
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:26,820
Whatever. Who cares? Put him over here. This is the tutorial mission. Who cares?

292
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:39,000
Let's go. I've got a group of three up here. It's now or never. Can't climb that shit.

293
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:50,710
Can he do anything about this? For the job straight through hell. Right. I'll follow.

294
00:40:55,530 --> 00:41:00,650
Can he shoot that path is blocked? Understood. Oh, I thought that. Hey, I had a John H was

295
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:05,530
activated. It was fucking me up. Well, we'll figure something out. He can't climb. Let's keep our

296
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:12,969
distance. Oh, wait, he was too old to climb it. See, save that game. You can highlight both

297
00:41:12,969 --> 00:41:19,449
characters. No, I beg your pardon. Oh, that's so much better. OK, cool. All right. Nice path is

298
00:41:19,449 --> 00:41:31,480
blocked this way. The path is blocked. I refuse. No, you can manage this rope ladder, Mr.

299
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:42,360
McCoy. I prefer Dr. McCoy. I'm sure you do. Why do we do that? OK, then. I refuse.

300
00:41:45,019 --> 00:41:52,539
How are we going to tackle this, man? We got a campfire over here. You've guns, right? I know

301
00:41:52,539 --> 00:41:56,940
I'm supposed to be tactical about this, but is that really going to be a thing? I could do

302
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:01,420
the showstopper and we could both do something. I could throw a knife at this guy right now. I'm

303
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:05,019
going to throw a knife at this guy right now. OK, he's dead. All right, now go get him. Go get him.

304
00:42:05,019 --> 00:42:09,480
Go get him. Go get him. Go get him. Go get him. Go get him. Go get him. Go get him. Go get him quick.

305
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:18,199
His friend's going to be looking for him. Here goes. Yeah, that worked. All right, let's do it

306
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:29,829
again. Someone's about to lose a few teeth. Got it. Let's go. That worked. OK, now what?

307
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:38,780
Here goes. What are they? Where's the site? All right, stay behind the rock.

308
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:46,179
OK, so I can coin. I'm going to coin him and then the doctor's going to get the doctor's going to.

309
00:42:46,179 --> 00:42:50,019
Do I get more? OK, I have a question. Do I get more points for doing things

310
00:42:50,980 --> 00:43:03,139
a good way? Or can I just shoot all the matter? It's just fishing. Wait, give me that back. He's

311
00:43:03,139 --> 00:43:12,039
not going to see it. All right, give me that back. He's not going to see it. Just what I had in mind.

312
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:15,460
Do you see this? All right, he'll see it if I throw it over here.

313
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:20,019
All right, so I'm going to gas him and then syringe him. It saved me. Let's throw out the door.

314
00:43:20,019 --> 00:43:32,699
It works very fast. Here they come. Objection's here.

315
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:40,889
I love how you can syringe people in this game. OK, he's gone, too. We only have one more person

316
00:43:40,889 --> 00:43:45,449
to deal with, and I know exactly how I'm going to do it. Still warming up shoes.

317
00:43:45,449 --> 00:43:50,489
OK, good. What's the next tutorial?

318
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:58,099
Guards wearing ponchos don't get fooled easily. They don't leave their posts

319
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:06,070
and distractions are shorter. Oh, that doesn't matter.

320
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:13,829
He ain't going to move if it ain't necessary. And you know that because trust me, I know the time.

321
00:44:13,909 --> 00:44:20,230
Who cares? Just kill him. Just kill him and then punch this guy in the face and throw him over the overboard.

322
00:44:27,579 --> 00:44:31,579
Oh, no, that guy is wearing a poncho. Does that mean he can't die?

323
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:37,260
No, he actually can die very easily like every other human. OK, kill him.

324
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:47,289
Oh, that was not good. Is he still unconscious? Showdown mode advanced. OK,

325
00:44:47,289 --> 00:44:50,489
showdown mode. Pause the game unless you plan one action per character.

326
00:44:50,489 --> 00:44:55,559
That's important. Press enter to instantly execute all the actions for a shift.

327
00:44:55,559 --> 00:45:01,619
You want to execute planned actions later. Oh, nice. OK, we can do it together.

328
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:09,719
We can do one and two. Give me that knife. OK, let's go back in business.

329
00:45:11,239 --> 00:45:19,880
Well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This is a guardhouse. Hey, ambush right on schedule.

330
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:25,849
Well, I forget what this guy's name is. It'll cost you our hide here.

331
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:29,059
I'm going to get extra points. We're going to kill all these people in here. All right.

332
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:34,230
Hide here. You hide here. Damn, that train's long. Right. I'm going to gas them.

333
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:38,789
Here we go. Anyway, I got a few tricks who wants to have a look.

334
00:45:38,789 --> 00:45:50,710
One out straight through hell. Never mind. I can handle that. Thank you.

335
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:59,019
Let's go. So we're going to I'm going to do advanced mode. Let's see how this works.

336
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:04,650
That's sweet. Sweet. Come on. Let's go about this quiet.

337
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:12,139
All right. Showdown. You take the other. All right. Showdown. I have a timer on this.

338
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:15,800
I don't. OK, good. Let's catch a few bandits.

339
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:20,679
I'm going to stab this person in the back and then you're going to syringe this person

340
00:46:20,679 --> 00:46:29,530
who needs a shot in the next trouble. Oh, come on. Nice. See you in hell.

341
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:38,250
OK, that was fun. That was really fun. OK, cool. Now what? Oh, shit. On show.

342
00:46:38,969 --> 00:46:43,559
Let me take care of that on my way. I would rather stay out of this.

343
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:49,190
Selecting multiple characters. You guys already told me that you're sure could use our health.

344
00:46:49,989 --> 00:46:55,269
I waste time. Let's keep going. Side quest. I hate fancy folk like you.

345
00:46:55,269 --> 00:46:57,590
All right. We have a side quest. Especially you.

346
00:46:57,590 --> 00:47:02,789
All right. We're going to throw a guy in the fire because I have to.

347
00:47:02,789 --> 00:47:05,510
All right. Showdown mode. Right. How do I do this without losing?

348
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:10,869
We have moral choices to make. OK, there's a guy right here.

349
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:15,780
Three, one, two, three. OK, I'm going to throw. Here we go. This is what we're going to do.

350
00:47:16,579 --> 00:47:24,460
We're going to throw a knife at this guy, syringe this guy. Here we go. Syringe you.

351
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:29,750
OK, then I'm going to switch over here and throw a knife at you. Watch and hurry up.

352
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:31,369
And we're going to go.

353
00:47:38,309 --> 00:47:42,329
All right. He got it. He's good. He's good. He's good. All right. Now shoot him.

354
00:47:45,639 --> 00:47:49,940
All right. You're all safe. Wait, there's one more. There's one more. There's one more.

355
00:47:54,340 --> 00:48:01,239
I didn't see that last guy. All right. That didn't work. I waste time. Let's keep going.

356
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:09,420
Stop collisioning each other. All right. There's one, two. This is the guy I thought. OK,

357
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:15,059
they're all like kneeling down. I thought he was one of them. All right. Eyes open.

358
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:18,500
Cooper. Here it goes. I didn't hear. Well, that's what you get.

359
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:24,380
Whatever your name is over here. Get a spot right here. Go.

360
00:48:25,659 --> 00:48:37,130
Shoot two people in showdown. That's right. Oh, yeah. OK. Bag. I think I can just kill this guy.

361
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:41,989
I don't need anybody knowing. No, maybe. Yeah, maybe I can. If I just get OK,

362
00:48:41,989 --> 00:48:47,130
if I just get over there, save it right here. If I just get over here because he can't see.

363
00:48:50,889 --> 00:49:01,340
All right. He's in a good spot. OK, new plan. What's up?

364
00:49:02,389 --> 00:49:05,590
You better give us everything. We're going to search your body.

365
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:16,519
You hear that? Who needs a good killing? Oh, look. Oh, look. Wait, shit. OK, where are you?

366
00:49:16,519 --> 00:49:24,659
Ready? I got lots of you going to be big. All right. Stay distracted. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry

367
00:49:24,659 --> 00:49:27,460
up. Hurry up. Get down. Get down. Get down. Get down. Get down. Get down. Get down. Get down. Get

368
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:37,340
down. Get down. Get down. Get down. I'm fine. All right. OK. Now. I hate fancy folk like you.

369
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:44,940
Now I'm going to stab. We're going to bag this guy or bag this guy or OK, we don't walk anyway.

370
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:54,059
Let's throw out the lower. That's what you get. Oh, no, no, no. I don't want you to look at it.

371
00:49:54,059 --> 00:50:03,579
No, no, no, no, no. You don't. I don't want him to look at it. OK, let's go. Let's raise some hell.

372
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:10,250
Got a load. It's only let me take care of that. Execute.

373
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:16,840
Straight through hell. Did he miss? What just happened? How come he didn't shoot this guy?

374
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:25,610
Why didn't he not shoot this guy? Keep it cool. Watch and learn. I'll get close and personal.

375
00:50:28,409 --> 00:50:34,889
That was a civilian. Thank you. I'll send you the check. Where are they? What's the big idea?

376
00:50:35,769 --> 00:50:46,840
I didn't kill a civilian, though. Are you kidding me? Wait. I'll follow. No more surprises.

377
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,179
I know I did not. I didn't kill anybody. It'll cost you.

378
00:50:51,900 --> 00:51:01,559
It burned bodies. Throw him in the fire. I know, but I don't want to get spotted. Look, you got this

379
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:11,639
time. What's he doing? Burn them. But I'm going. I'm going. I just I don't know if this guy's going

380
00:51:11,639 --> 00:51:24,650
to swap me. How's it going? Hurry up. I just want to. Where's the bad guys? You're heavy on my way.

381
00:51:27,659 --> 00:51:37,079
And up. I can't. You are the bad guy. I'm not the bad guy. The guy's the guy with the poncho.

382
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:50,039
No, forget it. I got a bullet for him. Shoot him. Shoot him. Why can't I shoot him?

383
00:51:52,630 --> 00:52:01,349
We need to be moving on. This is an obstruction. All right. Oh, God damn it. Um, I think we may

384
00:52:01,349 --> 00:52:07,159
have a problem. I did. Darren, you're going to have to do the rest of the game because I can't move.

385
00:52:07,159 --> 00:52:16,789
Now's the time. OK, Darren here. Take a few coins to buy some potions. OK, I have to do

386
00:52:16,789 --> 00:52:33,340
the rest of the game with him. Just yet. Sure. OK, cool. Let's go. Just load. I think I could

387
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:40,280
probably do it. Well, that was a waste of time. See, I knew you had a heart in there somewhere

388
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:53,780
anatomically. Maybe someone call for a doctor. How far away is the load? Oh, OK, we're good. We're

389
00:52:53,780 --> 00:53:05,929
fine. OK, then don't get anywhere. I knew you had a heart in there somewhere. All right, slow down,

390
00:53:05,929 --> 00:53:12,090
slow down, slow down. Maybe. Wait, there's a there's a treasure chest over there. Understood. I can't

391
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:17,530
wait till I get grenades. Seriously. One of the train looks like we made it. We still need the

392
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:27,099
dynamite to clear the tunnel. That's easy. Come on, let's make our way up on my way. Shall I get

393
00:53:27,099 --> 00:53:34,519
out of here? Go run. Keep your heads down and stay out of my way. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Thank you so

394
00:53:34,519 --> 00:53:51,320
much. You think you're. I see you asshole. I didn't. Let's keep our distance. It's fun.

395
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:55,559
I actually like this. This is actually fun. This is like a strategy game, but for fucking moron

396
00:53:55,559 --> 00:54:03,210
psychos like me. OK, do you like like strategy games with top down like kind of real time?

397
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:10,340
Yes. Are you also fucking psycho? Yeah. Oh, you're going to love this. Cool. Thanks. I've always

398
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:15,590
wanted to be the psycho RTS guy. Just what I had in mind. Let me take care of that. Where are you

399
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:18,309
going? Where are you going? Where are you going? Where are you going? Where are you going? Where are

400
00:54:18,309 --> 00:54:20,949
you going? Where are you going? Where are you going? Where are you going? Where are you going? Where

401
00:54:20,949 --> 00:54:27,190
are you going? Come on, let's make our way up. Understood. Get down. Don't get in the way. I'm

402
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:35,050
trying to read this. The view cone marker shows that the spot is watched by guards. Hold what?

403
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:50,440
Hold the L to place in a location or a guard. Not a problem. Something. Well, who do we have here?

404
00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:04,699
I'm trying to figure out the tutorial. You know, I got to stop clicking everywhere.

405
00:55:04,699 --> 00:55:07,500
I'm playing this like I'm playing League or like Dota.

406
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:25,900
But don't click that often. Why am I like, well, like, slow the fuck down. Shall we?

407
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:32,380
You click more often than you click in Diablo. All right. I have to get this treasure. I'm not

408
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:40,460
going to. OK, so what was it was hold L. I can see where they're looking or how does that work?

409
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:48,730
Let's see. It's kind of like a location of what they're looking at or something.

410
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:54,940
Let's see if an area is being watched or not. Looks like we made it.

411
00:55:54,940 --> 00:56:01,099
I still need the dynamite to clear the tunnel. That's easy. Come on, let's make our way up.

412
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:12,550
OK, so leave it on this guy. Not a problem. OK, can I kill this guy and get this stuff

413
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:18,809
without anybody seeing me do it in this bush? No, motherfucker. I swear to God. It's OK. Stay right

414
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:45,190
there. Let's make it quick. Get him. We'll take care of the bandits. Thank you. Thank you so much.

415
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:48,469
All right. Hold on. Is he going to notice that this guy's gone?

416
00:56:48,550 --> 00:57:16,170
I guess time's a changing. I can't put him down here. Can I? All right. Hold on. Here comes another

417
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:27,659
guy with a shovel. Now I want you. I want your eyes. Where are your eyes? There we go. All right.

418
00:57:27,659 --> 00:57:34,500
There's three of what in here? Someone call for a doctor. I can reload this. Let me take care of

419
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:46,440
that. There we go. All right. It's a reload. Nice. Nice. I get the dynamite.

420
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:59,659
The safe. I swear. Good time. They think they can hide. Thank you. Thank you so much.

421
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:02,940
Somewhere. Drag you out of there.

422
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:16,940
Oh, man. There's a sniper. Quick. Hey, stick your neck out as far as it can go, Terry.

423
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:25,420
There's a sharpshooter. No more surprises. Got to find them.

424
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:33,820
Whoever finds them gets their stuff. What? That sucks. I know they're here. Whoever finds them

425
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:40,460
gets their stuff. Okay. Not like not a thousand gold or something. Just get this stuff.

426
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:46,179
We got to smoke them out. Someone hiding in there. Shit. Don't let them get away.

427
00:58:50,780 --> 00:59:02,150
Okay. Let's go reload that again. It'll cost you. I'll take that. Thank you. I hope I don't need

428
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:16,679
this. Okay. So we're going to distract. Okay. They're going to go in here, not out here. Yes.

429
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:24,980
They're all going back into the train. We're fine. Oh, what about this guy? I beg your pardon.

430
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:32,889
Can't get him. It's an obstruction. I'm sorry. Sorry, you two. I can't do anything about it.

431
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:41,320
If they make choices. I got a feeling about this. I'm going to throw a coin right here and we're

432
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:46,329
going to go do a showdown. These two. Let's see what's happening here. Not yet though.

433
00:59:54,329 --> 01:00:02,780
Oh, God damn it. Really? Hey, coin. What oldest trick in the book. If we can grab

434
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:08,869
all three of these guys, heads or tails, distract three bandits at the same time.

435
01:00:11,159 --> 01:00:20,969
Uh, I got lots of these need some change. I don't, they're not going to look over here. Go.

436
01:00:24,099 --> 01:00:27,940
That big rock there is looking like it wants to fall. Wait, I can fit a big

437
01:00:29,139 --> 01:00:31,860
wave. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

438
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:39,019
hold on a big rock. It was like 10 people right here. Oh no. Okay. Let's just, let's get them.

439
01:00:40,389 --> 01:00:43,269
All right. Who's going to do it? Somebody has to push it. Push the rock, push the rock, push the

440
01:00:43,269 --> 01:00:58,969
rock. Excuse me. Go to push the rock. Oh shit. I thought it was going to roll at least a little

441
01:00:58,969 --> 01:01:13,289
bit. Can I get on a horse? This is wild. Okay. There's one guy here. All right. We're going to

442
01:01:13,289 --> 01:01:20,250
distract this guy and then you're going to knock yourself out. Oh, together, together, together,

443
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:28,469
together at once. Sure thing. Got it. On the horse. We get on the horse. Now's the time. Get on

444
01:01:28,469 --> 01:01:35,900
the horse. Well, now let's see. I wouldn't worry just yet. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Showdown

445
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:39,019
mode. We have to, I, we have to, we have to just kill this guy. Double team him or something.

446
01:01:39,019 --> 01:01:44,619
Here, go to the gas. I understood. It's just fishing. Hey, that's going to pay for it. Here

447
01:01:44,619 --> 01:01:58,969
they come. It works very fast. See you in hell. I'm here. What do I do with these?

448
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:05,820
What do I do with these? I don't think I can do anything with those guys. Oh shit. Save it.

449
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:16,329
You can't see shit. Okay. All right. We almost did the dynamite. I'm almost got it. Somebody's

450
01:02:16,329 --> 01:02:19,849
about to lose a lot of money betting that I wasn't going to get past the first mission of the game.

451
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:35,559
Um, what are you doing? What are you doing? You're about to. Let's go fuse. Trying to touch the

452
01:02:35,559 --> 01:02:43,829
tutorial. Pick up dynamite from the barrel and throw it. Oh, come on. Yes. Okay. The game just

453
01:02:43,829 --> 01:02:50,659
increased in value. Aim with Q and throw with it using left mouse. Be careful. It'll explode in

454
01:02:50,659 --> 01:03:03,510
your hand. Oh no. All right. Oh, only one of us is going to do this. Pick up the dynamite,

455
01:03:03,510 --> 01:03:18,059
not the guy on the ground. That's a very, very short fuse. It's not, that's a really short fuse.

456
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:26,179
By the, I had so many people are just dead up here. All right. Who needs this? I object

457
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:36,570
back in business. You better have a fuse. Better throw it fast.

458
01:03:37,449 --> 01:03:55,610
Wait, it's already lit. Oh shit. The horse. All right. We're good. We're good. We're good.

459
01:03:55,610 --> 01:04:07,190
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Do I need to show down time for dying? All right. I'm going to

460
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:15,340
move him out of the way. Here it goes. We have these, this guy, let's take these guys out first.

461
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:22,280
I'm not fucking around anymore. Let's go. These guys all got to die. What are you looking at?

462
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:37,699
Us. All right. Get the bag out. Hide in the bush and then we're going to go. This guy's dead.

463
01:04:37,699 --> 01:04:43,769
Okay. Throw it out there now. What the fuck was that? What was that? I was trying to throw the

464
01:04:43,769 --> 01:05:00,920
briefcase. Who needs the fucking briefcase? Just stab him in the head. All right. Pick this up.

465
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:09,019
Gotta love bits. Are we killing bandits? Why would they love bandits? Okay. Does that guy dead?

466
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:13,739
I smell trouble. I hear for a second. Where's his eyesight? All right. We'll go over here.

467
01:05:15,110 --> 01:05:31,260
This is only temporary. Something on that I don't like. Get in there. Safe up here. Safe. Only one

468
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:36,219
at a time though, please. Shall we continue? You stay in the bush. Let's see what's happening here.

469
01:05:36,219 --> 01:05:38,539
Okay. I'm going to throw. We're going to throw a coin right here.

470
01:05:41,449 --> 01:05:49,429
You hear that? Watch and learn. Okay. He's dead. Anybody else? We're good. All right.

471
01:05:49,429 --> 01:05:55,590
Let's go. Not sure where this is going. Let's keep our distance. Back in business. Now, only one of

472
01:05:55,590 --> 01:06:00,389
you go down here to the dynamite, except you need this shit. Here, come here. Looks like we're past

473
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:07,190
Denver. You go up here and hide in a bush. You come down here and you refill your ammo and then

474
01:06:07,190 --> 01:06:14,739
get the dynamite. Got it. Okay. I'm ready. I'm going to throw this. Oh, but there's a guy I could

475
01:06:14,739 --> 01:06:31,079
like punch. It's now or never. I've missed the fuse. Now run. I'm in the bush.

476
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,000
Good thing we got more dynamite.

477
01:06:39,559 --> 01:06:53,590
Hey, now we're good. Right? He's in a bush. He's in a bush. Why do they know what bush he's in?

478
01:07:01,110 --> 01:07:07,269
Fuck you. Okay. I've missed the fuse. Better throw it fast.

479
01:07:12,789 --> 01:07:19,349
Oh, wait, wait, wait. Oh my goodness. Did you see that? Holy shit. I killed everybody. I killed

480
01:07:19,989 --> 01:07:28,679
everybody freaking out. Let's find a safe spot. Good thing we got more dynamite. Okay.

481
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:37,909
You better have a plan. All right. Now what? Play the tunnel. Meet up at the meeting spot.

482
01:07:38,469 --> 01:07:48,340
I got a feeling about. Oh, I can save these people. Oh, you're both going different ways.

483
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:59,130
Just what I had in mind. Don't get in the way. This guy has a shovel. He's not going to threat.

484
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:07,349
This is the guy that's the threat. My thoughts exactly.

485
01:08:07,989 --> 01:08:12,230
Bring it on. Here it goes. Edit and then save the civilians.

486
01:08:13,269 --> 01:08:20,859
I'll take that. Let's make it quick. All right. You're free. Don't take it personal.

487
01:08:20,859 --> 01:08:24,939
Keep your hands down. Nice. We'll take care of the pain. That's what I did it. That's a

488
01:08:25,659 --> 01:08:31,510
secondary objective. Not a problem. Meeting point. Let's go. All right.

489
01:08:34,329 --> 01:08:38,729
All right. Here it is. Let's deal with the rest of them. My thoughts exactly.

490
01:08:39,289 --> 01:08:45,510
What is this game? This is Desperado's three. And so far, this is actually pretty fun.

491
01:08:47,369 --> 01:08:52,090
Guess you made the David company happy today. How much do you get for a job like this?

492
01:08:53,270 --> 01:09:01,020
Hope you're not expecting a cut. Relax. I got what I need. This counts as a plus

493
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:05,579
full letter grade, by the way, if I can drive the car, which is a horse got to make good on time.

494
01:09:06,539 --> 01:09:14,359
Like I said, please, I got an appointment. I'd like to keep suits yourself.

495
01:09:17,770 --> 01:09:22,329
Right. I mean, if I can fall sprint the horse into bad guys, you McCoy have to give it a full

496
01:09:22,329 --> 01:09:32,939
letter. Sure. If you need a professional, you know who to send for. Good day, Mr. Cooper.

497
01:09:33,579 --> 01:09:37,399
Wait, we're losing them. That guy was so useful.

498
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:52,739
Owen Wilson team up. Oh, I didn't get this one. Don't save during the mission. Don't use fire

499
01:09:52,739 --> 01:09:59,560
arms. Complete the mission in under five minutes. The mission on hard. Well, I got two out of three.

500
01:10:00,439 --> 01:10:04,789
This always is the most obnoxious thing. And I hate seeing this in every iPad game.

501
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:09,109
Two stars is like, holy shit, dude, come on. You were so close to the three.

502
01:10:09,989 --> 01:10:14,619
One star means you don't care. And you don't have any fucking in game currency shit.

503
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:20,300
Two is you probably bought in game currency shit, but you used it so poorly that you still couldn't

504
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:32,520
get to three stars. That pisses me off seeing that. Wait a minute. Hold on. What you can

505
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:52,970
tells you everything you did. This is awesome. All right. Where do we go from here? Why is this

506
01:10:52,970 --> 01:11:04,899
money explosions? You're going to see when I compulsively had to throw somebody off the cliff.

507
01:11:04,899 --> 01:11:30,390
Does this take into account all the saves? Save one save number three. Wait, what happened up there?

508
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:56,939
What? What exploded? I feel like I'm playing like a Gario. Holy shit. That was awesome. Nice.

509
01:11:56,939 --> 01:12:11,289
Let's see. That's so cool. Eight saves. Twenty two. What's that? Twenty two. What was he on fire?

510
01:12:11,289 --> 01:12:15,060
Does that mean he did better if he was the better teammate? OK,

511
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:25,750
let's save in the replay. Twenty two saves, eight loads. Oh, that's cool. Thirty three minutes,

512
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:35,500
seven shots, three dynamites and stabs kills thirty alarm. Enemies killed. There's only two

513
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:47,380
people left on the whole map alive. That kind of bad. The star is five minutes. Yeah, no way.

514
01:12:48,020 --> 01:13:01,210
All right, we got Devil's Canyon. Yes, pass and then Flagstone. Do you feel the game is too hard?

515
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:08,010
No, I don't want to adjust. John Cooper has come to Flagstone to meet an old friend. Doesn't take

516
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:15,380
long for trouble to arrive. I just beat the first level in thirty three minutes. Do you think I'm

517
01:13:15,380 --> 01:13:22,760
having not that much trouble? Troublemakers in Flagstone. Nestled between the peaks of the

518
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:28,039
Colorado Rockies lies the small town of Flagstone. Store owners, farmers, blacksmiths and barkeepers

519
01:13:28,039 --> 01:13:32,760
all go about their daily business. Workers of the David Company mingle with the locals as they

520
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:38,279
continue to build the new railroad through town. As Cooper arrives in Flagstone, he heads straight

521
01:13:38,279 --> 01:13:43,640
for the saloon, which is empty except for a few regulars. The barmaid pours a glass of whiskey in

522
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:48,600
the nurse. The nurse, he nurses it while he waits for an old friend. Can't fucking read anymore.

523
01:13:48,600 --> 01:14:00,470
They tore down old Williams House the other day. Call the sheriff. Now, why do they have to do that?

524
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:06,229
Can't they lay their tracks between our homes? Actually bad. Stick to the game, will you? Yeah,

525
01:14:06,229 --> 01:14:13,029
I'm just saying they ever come to my house. I'll show these railroad thugs whose balls. Oh, shit.

526
01:14:13,029 --> 01:14:18,869
Well, what can I do for you, gentlemen? Oh, we'll get to you in a minute. You know the drill.

527
01:14:18,869 --> 01:14:25,109
Everybody out. Yes, sir. Game of cards. It always looks like this. Oh, you keep fucking track of

528
01:14:25,109 --> 01:14:29,909
who's who. Something in your ears. Just finishing my drink. Better dealer, man. You gotta go to a

529
01:14:29,909 --> 01:14:41,960
better banker in Monopoly. We own this town now. So when he says out. Look at me. We don't like

530
01:14:42,039 --> 01:14:50,949
troublemakers around here. Who do we have here? Well, you got double trouble now.

531
01:14:51,909 --> 01:15:00,890
What the hell? You again? Is the doctor. Wait, he's on my team.

532
01:15:02,649 --> 01:15:09,300
They're running away. I can't blame them. Poor guys had to look at your ugly mug.

533
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:15,939
Oh, you're welcome. You need a drink. Is it like a giant sword? A bow and arrow?

534
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:25,539
Yours is on the house. The big axle for a car. You really shouldn't. They'll kill you next time.

535
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:32,489
They can try. I guess you've been here a while. Spent your time pissing off the wrong people,

536
01:15:32,489 --> 01:15:38,010
huh? I'm the one that pissed off. But as you're here, maybe we can work together.

537
01:15:38,010 --> 01:15:42,010
Oh, no, you're not dragging me into this. He shot that guy. I'm here for Frank.

538
01:15:42,090 --> 01:15:47,140
Surround the place. Don't let them get away. Amigo, you're already in it. And besides,

539
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:53,779
you owe me one. All right, let's get out of here. Come on out the back. The guy's dabbing. Of

540
01:15:53,779 --> 01:15:57,939
course you would say that. That's okay. I mean, of course that that's what's happening.

541
01:16:04,859 --> 01:16:10,300
It's a bloodborne weapon. That's so funny. All right, let's go. What's his special power?

542
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:19,100
They're here somewhere. And we got all the time in the world. Well, these guys are out for blood.

543
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:26,380
The Monster Hunter. Part of the David company. I've scores to settle with a few of them.

544
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:34,680
Cooper, find any green teeth. I need it. I'm trying to turn this into a poison weapon. Sure.

545
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:39,960
Let's head for the street. Nobody will bother us if we stay among the townsfolk. So we got room to

546
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:51,300
breathe. So far so good. But whose heads are we bashing in? First, we got Jarvis here. We're tough

547
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:57,800
guys. Right now he's in that backyard trying to ride that just kill him. That's just gonna kill

548
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:03,800
him anyway. Next is Wilde March. She's on the first floor of the flagstone brothel. Oh, this is

549
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:13,289
awesome. Whiskey and watching the girls. This is gonna be so awesome. I can't wait. Then there's

550
01:17:13,289 --> 01:17:23,380
the Duke. He's making rounds with his bootlickers up and down Church Street. And last is the former

551
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:30,659
people don't have to kill. He's a real asshole had his men tear down half the towns that he

552
01:17:30,659 --> 01:17:36,659
doesn't have to plan around it. So we get rid of them. Head back to the saloon and finish our

553
01:17:36,659 --> 01:17:41,859
drinks. That ain't much of a plan. Hector. Why do you think I've waited for you? All right.

554
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:46,739
Let's get it over with. I have to sneak around. Am I allowed to be in this town? What's the matter

555
01:17:46,739 --> 01:17:57,500
with these guys? Well, now I don't have to sneak. Right. I guys live here. Hector can whistle to

556
01:17:57,500 --> 01:18:06,170
lure guards towards his current location. It's a trap. He can place Bianca, a giant but surprisingly

557
01:18:06,170 --> 01:18:17,380
stealthy bear trap. Hector is smart. So Hector likes to combine his skills. That seems really,

558
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:22,899
really morbid. Just unnecessary and completely inappropriate. Why don't you just learn how to

559
01:18:22,899 --> 01:18:29,460
fucking shoot a gun? I say it's time to use Bianca. You still carry that thing around. I have a

560
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:40,100
reputation to keep. Time to use Bianca. Let's lure someone into your embrace. Get your shit

561
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:53,000
together. Hector, it don't work. Can we get this over with? We're not done yet, amigo. I'll use my

562
01:18:53,000 --> 01:19:07,180
singing voice. I do it. You got it, amigo. Sing. Sing. Is he even gonna step in it? Don't think

563
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:16,039
you can hide. Who needs a haircut? Yeah, I got it. You better leave Blackstone before I find you.

564
01:19:21,079 --> 01:19:25,159
Super, the trap didn't work. Trust me, it doesn't usually go like this.

565
01:19:28,229 --> 01:19:37,430
Wait, isn't that the main bad guy? Oh, come on. What? That's the main bad guy.

566
01:19:41,819 --> 01:19:51,800
I just need a few seconds. Don't let them get away. We gotta smoke them out. Let's make it quick.

567
01:19:53,399 --> 01:19:59,289
Who needs no bloody? I knew I was right to bring you along.

568
01:19:59,289 --> 01:20:03,689
Sure glad I'm meeting your expectations. We got troublemakers here. Keep your eyes to you.

569
01:20:03,689 --> 01:20:10,170
I need this back. Where are they? Keep looking. Gotta find them. Fucking three-head. What?

570
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:18,859
Fuckers. Whoever finds them gets their stuff. It's so lame. What about T? What's T do?

571
01:20:20,140 --> 01:20:25,989
Good stuff. Oh, I can heal Hector. I'm in the mood for some chopping. They gotta be around here

572
01:20:25,989 --> 01:20:36,659
somewhere. Yeah, that's right. You run home to mama. Give me this back. On my way. She looks ready for

573
01:20:36,659 --> 01:20:44,659
more. I see you. Fuck. Why does this keep happening? Hiding in there. It's the two chokers.

574
01:20:44,659 --> 01:20:52,659
What is he saying? Drink, drink, drink, drink. I think you're clever. I found you.

575
01:20:58,300 --> 01:21:15,029
Whoa. What? He's Estus chugging. Can't even say it. It's so stupid.

576
01:21:24,539 --> 01:21:27,899
We already know what happens here. What's wrong with my voice? Okay, this is what I'm talking about.

577
01:21:27,899 --> 01:21:33,579
Nobody move. Nobody talk. Nobody say anything. This is permanently... I've turned into Tom Hanks.

578
01:21:33,579 --> 01:21:37,659
Somehow I just turned into Tom Hanks because my voice has changed a little because I was drinking

579
01:21:37,659 --> 01:21:43,420
water. Let me tell you, I loved working on Toy Story. It was one of my favorite movies working

580
01:21:43,420 --> 01:21:47,659
on. Favorite film. I love being Woody. He's the best character I've ever done work with.

581
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:57,020
And I'll tell you, Tim Allen with Buzzkill, he was great. He was great. He was great, Tom.

582
01:22:02,619 --> 01:22:16,939
I'll never get that again. Hiding here. He was never really here to begin with. All right,

583
01:22:16,939 --> 01:22:22,409
let me get this right. How would you not see a gigantic bear trap on the ground? Okay,

584
01:22:22,489 --> 01:22:27,289
put it like right there. It wants me to seriously learn how to do this.

585
01:22:33,529 --> 01:22:34,970
Okay, we're still here?

586
01:22:35,210 --> 01:22:36,250
Time to make some noise.

587
01:22:51,479 --> 01:22:55,449
Yeah, still fresh. All right, get it back. We're good. Save it.

588
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:04,039
Let's take a look at the plan here. Okay, we got two guys here.

589
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:08,199
He can't hide forever. Make it this way. Let's check and see. Let's take a look at what he's

590
01:23:08,199 --> 01:23:22,859
looking at. All right, he's got a big radius. Where's he go? All right, he goes, he turns his

591
01:23:22,859 --> 01:23:28,699
back. How's our opportunity? Go. Remember, leave the big guy to me. He got you once already.

592
01:23:28,699 --> 01:23:37,619
He's all yours. Where do you look? Are we safer? We have to be, right? Long coats. Yeah, the most

593
01:23:37,619 --> 01:23:42,420
dangerous enemies. Hector is the only one that can take them down by himself with his axe or his

594
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:52,020
bare fists. That's good to know. That's why he didn't step in the trap. I'm going to show down

595
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:56,420
this. I'm going to wait. Can we get this? He's going to stab this guy in the back. He's going

596
01:23:56,420 --> 01:24:02,970
to go for him and have the axe. Yeah, they couldn't have slipped through. Let's get going.

597
01:24:02,970 --> 01:24:14,069
Go down mode. Is he immune to guns? I mean, he has to be right. All right, time for a showdown.

598
01:24:16,569 --> 01:24:21,130
You are going to go stab him in the back. Come on. Hector, you are going to go over here.

599
01:24:21,130 --> 01:24:27,449
Nobody messes with Hector. What are you going to do? What is he going to do?

600
01:24:28,739 --> 01:24:33,859
Whistle? Hector, you're going to whistle. I'll use my singing voice. Yep. And then you're going to

601
01:24:33,859 --> 01:24:46,060
hide. Whistle. Let's go. Oh, my God. You fucking did it. Just a scratch.

602
01:24:47,979 --> 01:25:03,640
It's so quick. How come we didn't whistle? I have to click it? I thought it was like,

603
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:09,000
OK, I'm so I'm in showstopper mode. You're ready. So like whistles my singing whistle. OK,

604
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,859
I get it. You have to actually do it. You're going to go over there and you're stabbing the

605
01:25:12,859 --> 01:25:18,619
knife. And then you are going to just like the Sims. If I haven't do something else,

606
01:25:18,619 --> 01:25:34,729
we do it. Time for the X. Let's lure someone in. Is this place just a scratch? Why is he a bear?

607
01:25:34,729 --> 01:25:43,300
What's going on? Are you behind this door, Sonny? Don't move an inch.

608
01:25:43,779 --> 01:25:48,180
Who needs a haircut? Hey, it's the two jokers. Who the fuck are you?

609
01:25:52,180 --> 01:26:02,539
OK, I have to I got to lower him again. This strategy is not going to work. OK. I mean,

610
01:26:02,539 --> 01:26:14,380
we could turn him around and go this way. Come on. It'll be fun. Keep your head down. I just need a

611
01:26:14,380 --> 01:26:24,899
few seconds. Throw it over there. Put a cork in it. What the fuck? And then wrap around this way.

612
01:26:25,779 --> 01:26:33,640
I can't kill him. Turn up the long coat. Isn't that going to make a huge bunch of noise?

613
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:53,189
Stop being bad. I've been that guy for 10 minutes. Come on, amigo. No, I need to. OK, I know. I have

614
01:26:53,189 --> 01:26:59,529
to coin him and then kill him. All day. We go. Ready? Lots of these point him heads or tails.

615
01:26:59,529 --> 01:27:08,949
Kill him. Not worth it. I do it again later. Oh, you can kill people, too. That's good. Well,

616
01:27:08,949 --> 01:27:15,770
I'm getting thirsty, Murdoch. I can't hide forever, Sam. Let's do this. Get your shit together.

617
01:27:16,649 --> 01:27:28,119
How's it going? Shall we? Let's do this again. Go time. Ready? What? Oh, you son of a bitch.

618
01:27:30,119 --> 01:27:37,609
Fucking restart the goddamn thing. Just use the axe. He's going to but he's going to see that.

619
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:44,859
I got lots of that over here. Come on. You come over here and use the axe on these guys.

620
01:27:45,819 --> 01:27:50,699
I like it. Oh, sure. Knock yourself.

621
01:27:55,380 --> 01:27:58,340
All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. This is perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect.

622
01:27:58,340 --> 01:28:05,819
Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. You're going to go. You're going to go this way.

623
01:28:06,619 --> 01:28:11,020
You're going to go. Actors here. Act them right in the head. I'm in this way, amigo.

624
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:15,579
And then you're going to distract them. Throw a coin right behind all this trick in the book.

625
01:28:15,579 --> 01:28:17,579
Okay. Check this shit out. Go. Let's go.

626
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:19,579
Fucking idiot.

627
01:28:26,229 --> 01:28:31,670
Not your lucky day. Don't let them get away. You got it, amigo. Anybody find anything?

628
01:28:33,050 --> 01:28:34,970
Time for the axe. Time to go.

629
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:45,800
True. I was ready to bring it along. Sure. Glad I'll meet your expectations.

630
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:51,159
It's like slaughtering people. All right. We have to stop doing this.

631
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:15,979
Why do they keep reviving him? I put the bear trap down right here and then you're

632
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:19,579
going to do it. I didn't pick the knife up. I'll get close and personal.

633
01:29:19,579 --> 01:29:23,340
All right. Just no, no, no. Just put it down. Who do we have here? I'll run.

634
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:32,649
What's he doing? Run. Run. You fucking moron. Someone's about to lose a few teeth.

635
01:29:34,180 --> 01:29:36,020
All right. Kill him. I have to kill this guy.

636
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:51,239
Someone needs to get things done. Oh shit. Time for the axe. Okay. I'm good. We did it.

637
01:29:52,119 --> 01:30:01,399
I made it. All right. She looks ready for more. How do I hide all these guys?

638
01:30:01,399 --> 01:30:13,979
I don't think I can throw them down the well. Yeah, I'm ready. This is nothing over there.

639
01:30:13,979 --> 01:30:24,789
No problem. Can't do it. Can't throw them in the well. Why? Look, I killed everybody that would

640
01:30:24,789 --> 01:30:36,979
be showing up over here anyway. Does it really matter? Forget it. I can do this all day.

641
01:30:37,539 --> 01:30:44,710
It does. Yes. Okay. All right. I'm doing it. This bush is going to stink after a few days,

642
01:30:44,710 --> 01:30:49,319
by the way. This is going to be the smelliest bush ever. People are going to be like,

643
01:30:49,319 --> 01:30:52,920
holy shit, someone's going to pull that up. What's wrong with that bush? It smells so bad.

644
01:30:56,500 --> 01:31:13,539
That's a problem. I can handle it. Let's light this up. Okay. The game is saved. We're good.

645
01:31:15,140 --> 01:31:20,260
And that was tricky. Yeah. How many people? All right. So now I can be in the town with it.

646
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:25,859
Civil zones. Characters can move through civil zones undetected. As long as they don't act

647
01:31:25,859 --> 01:31:30,340
suspicious, the red marker will indicate when you're about to leave or enter a civil zone.

648
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:40,869
Here we go. Look, it's now we're just normal people. Hey, look at that. Civil first on your

649
01:31:40,869 --> 01:31:46,310
list. How about we just kill them in the order we like. Great plan. You have there. You heard

650
01:31:46,310 --> 01:31:49,430
what happened with the church bell the other day. So who's on the list?

651
01:31:50,789 --> 01:31:57,829
Okay. Kill the company thugs. Where's Jarvis? Guy over there. Wild Marge. McBain and the Duke.

652
01:31:59,579 --> 01:32:04,920
All right. Let's let's head up that way. Follow this guy around.

653
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:11,399
Dang. I thought all this would be good for the town. We were so,

654
01:32:11,399 --> 01:32:15,239
so happy when the mayor told us that the railroad would come. That's the Duke right there.

655
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:20,199
Oh, you take a good look. It's the guy running the company. Yeah, he wants to see his

656
01:32:21,239 --> 01:32:25,560
dog. Doesn't give a doesn't give a shit about it. Yeah, we're just talking.

657
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:36,659
Okay. We know friends won't take long. This is outrageous. You can't just

658
01:32:36,659 --> 01:32:41,380
tear down my house. I'm not going to just do that. I need to have at least somewhat of a plan.

659
01:32:41,380 --> 01:32:47,460
Where does he go? I want to see. Does he leave a civil zone?

660
01:32:48,659 --> 01:32:52,100
Okay. Now what if I put a trap right when he comes over here? Will this guy see?

661
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:56,979
We, uh, all right, here we go. We're going to try this here because our good friend,

662
01:32:57,619 --> 01:33:24,619
I think I can get that to work. I really do.

663
01:33:25,579 --> 01:33:29,060
He's trying to catch a bear. They're walking around it.

664
01:33:32,100 --> 01:33:33,939
How many of these people are going to look around? What are you looking?

665
01:33:35,859 --> 01:33:38,500
You're looking straight ahead. You're just a civilian. What? Who cares?

666
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:40,340
If you see, you gotta put a bear trap down and get out of here.

667
01:33:43,460 --> 01:33:44,819
Wait, what's this? What's this bell?

668
01:33:47,779 --> 01:33:49,539
Wait, I can throw somebody in a coffin.

669
01:33:56,020 --> 01:34:07,399
I can get over here. This is still a civil zone. I'm allowed to be here.

670
01:34:12,869 --> 01:34:14,229
This is going to kill anybody that's right there.

671
01:34:15,670 --> 01:34:18,310
There's so many ways to kill people. Is that going to kill this guy too, right?

672
01:34:23,130 --> 01:34:25,050
Is he going to walk over here and I'm going to looney tune this guy?

673
01:34:29,210 --> 01:34:32,250
And I said, shut the fuck up. Yeah, I can. All right. I'm going to.

674
01:34:33,369 --> 01:34:36,329
Cooper, you go over there. You too. This is a civil zone, right?

675
01:34:39,289 --> 01:34:42,329
No, it's not. It's not a civil zone anymore. When you go through there,

676
01:34:43,369 --> 01:34:52,899
is he going to walk through here? Okay. This is not a civil zone anymore. Not yet. Now I want you

677
01:34:52,899 --> 01:35:00,090
time to go get over here. You don't mind this, right? Only Cooper can climb fucking trees.

678
01:35:00,090 --> 01:35:10,659
All right. We'll switch. Things are quiet. It's like this. Sure thing. This is outrageous.

679
01:35:10,659 --> 01:35:15,460
You can't just tear down my house. I'm obviously going to squash this guy.

680
01:35:17,449 --> 01:35:21,050
Get everybody in the right position. Save the game. All right. I'm going to squash the guy first.

681
01:35:21,050 --> 01:35:28,819
Relax, amigo. I'm going to sneak over here. Only got one guy right there.

682
01:35:29,619 --> 01:35:33,939
You're looking this way. You're safe all the way until right here.

683
01:35:34,579 --> 01:35:37,590
All right. This is where they're laying the tracks.

684
01:35:38,310 --> 01:35:43,029
McBain's the foreman and doesn't let anyone on site. Let's keep it quiet when we head in.

685
01:35:44,170 --> 01:35:48,170
He's too talking. I could probably trap this guy if I wanted to.

686
01:35:54,140 --> 01:35:56,380
What happened? Has this guy walked over here?

687
01:36:00,300 --> 01:36:11,000
Shit. What? Oh no. God damn it. All right. I got to take these guys out one by one then.

688
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:15,100
I'm going to trap right here and I'm going to whistle somebody and someone's going to die.

689
01:36:15,100 --> 01:36:21,819
Hurry up. Hey there, you. You're enjoying yourself yet, Cooper? This way, amigo.

690
01:36:22,779 --> 01:36:27,979
This is where they're laying the tracks. McBain's the foreman and doesn't let anyone on site.

691
01:36:27,979 --> 01:36:34,539
Let's keep it quiet when we head in. Where? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

692
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:40,789
I can't help but have the fucking wood. They heard that?

693
01:36:43,590 --> 01:36:54,300
They can see me. Girl, this wood. I have to distract everybody. Okay.

694
01:36:55,770 --> 01:36:59,689
I can't go through there. You're going up here. Changing you.

695
01:37:03,220 --> 01:37:11,140
Does anybody care that I'm doing this? I don't think so, right?

696
01:37:14,739 --> 01:37:17,060
All right. Let's take a look. I got to get up there.

697
01:37:18,949 --> 01:37:21,909
This guy's looking straight ahead. Who cares? I care about this guy.

698
01:37:22,630 --> 01:37:28,539
I think I can just knife him right now.

699
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:34,340
This guy's fucking dead. Let's go. Nobody else, right?

700
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:41,420
This dude is looking straight ahead that way.

701
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:50,979
Wait, am I just going to throw the bell at him? What do I do with the bell?

702
01:37:53,109 --> 01:38:06,949
Oh, I'm going to kill this guy. Here he comes. This guy's dead.

703
01:38:20,260 --> 01:38:22,739
One down, three to go. What about the coffin?

704
01:38:25,539 --> 01:38:31,020
These guys didn't even care. Can I throw them in the coffin?

705
01:38:31,020 --> 01:38:33,260
Why does this coffin exist? Doesn't that seem weird, right?

706
01:38:33,979 --> 01:38:43,609
What do I do? All right. I'm jumping down. Wait.

707
01:38:56,340 --> 01:38:58,180
Okay. Now, wait, wait, wait. Are these guys coming?

708
01:38:59,579 --> 01:39:00,539
Now he's going to check the roof.

709
01:39:09,619 --> 01:39:15,779
I'm really going to have to sneak through here, aren't I? I might have to go a different way.

710
01:39:26,550 --> 01:39:32,260
Okay. Now I'm going to get, this is the only guy that stays down here. That was my fault.

711
01:39:32,260 --> 01:39:37,960
Yeah. Well, just hold on and watch. Let's get going. Can't you jump off the roof?

712
01:39:38,439 --> 01:39:44,619
And I'm going to sneak behind this guy, knock him out and I'm going to bury him.

713
01:40:09,270 --> 01:40:16,649
A lot of people can fit in here, apparently. Okay. Anything else?

714
01:40:18,090 --> 01:40:20,649
I have to actually be careful here. There's one guy pointing this way. I'm just going to

715
01:40:20,649 --> 01:40:33,960
hide. I'm going to climb back around. Clown coffin. What are you doing? All right. That's

716
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:57,770
one dead. We need three more. Do they know? Go over there and distract them. Do something.

717
01:41:02,069 --> 01:41:08,869
Okay. Now come down. We're good. All right. That's one down.

718
01:41:08,869 --> 01:41:17,180
Here we go. Maybe we can't do that one yet. Maybe I have to wait.

719
01:41:20,020 --> 01:41:26,180
Climb up there. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

720
01:41:26,180 --> 01:41:32,579
I thought all this would be good for the town. We were so, so happy when the mayor told us.

721
01:41:32,579 --> 01:41:35,300
German doesn't read this message. I will eat my barbecue chicken. Well, now you've got to figure

722
01:41:35,300 --> 01:41:39,939
out something else to eat. It's the guy running the company. Wait, wait, if German doesn't read

723
01:41:39,939 --> 01:41:47,300
this message, I will eat. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. This is the, we got to probably have to like

724
01:41:47,300 --> 01:42:01,500
poison this guy or something. I mean, I could, I could just throw an axe at him, right?

725
01:42:03,979 --> 01:42:14,010
Is there a place to hide? Is there a bush right here somewhere? I could just throw something at

726
01:42:14,010 --> 01:42:21,050
him. Oh, these are a little, okay. These are little helpers.

727
01:42:27,289 --> 01:42:37,000
Tom's up there. All right. Let's go. What do I do about this guy? Just kill him and run. Sniping

728
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:47,659
spot. I don't think I can shoot that far. Sure thing. I'm down here. Who's this? All right. Let's

729
01:42:47,659 --> 01:42:50,779
go check this guy out. We're probably going to be able to knock him off the thing and kill him.

730
01:42:50,779 --> 01:43:00,090
Right. Understood. You got it, amigo. Too many guards for some backyard corral. Jarvis and his

731
01:43:00,090 --> 01:43:05,689
man hang around here. Only one guy. What do you mean? One person. All right. Time for distractions.

732
01:43:05,689 --> 01:43:14,869
We're in. Point. Heads or tails. Come on. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

733
01:43:14,869 --> 01:43:20,550
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Show stop. I got a plan. Okay.

734
01:43:21,029 --> 01:43:30,149
I'm here. Put this shit down right here. Bianca. And then you're going to roll a coin. I just need

735
01:43:30,149 --> 01:43:33,590
a few seconds. Right here. Just for a second so we can get some time to figure this out.

736
01:43:37,590 --> 01:43:40,789
And you and I. Wait. Show stop. Show town. Whatever. Just stop it again.

737
01:43:41,430 --> 01:43:49,420
I don't know. I need another coin. Ready? Oldest year goes.

738
01:43:50,060 --> 01:43:52,229
Get in.

739
01:43:56,229 --> 01:43:58,229
Okay. Now what?

740
01:44:00,229 --> 01:44:04,229
I can just go over there. I think I can just kill him.

741
01:44:15,770 --> 01:44:25,300
No one's going to even step on that. Piss off the bull. Yeah. I mean how?

742
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:33,979
Do I just fire a gun? Okay. I'm going to fire a gun. Just shoot and the bull's going to freak out.

743
01:44:34,779 --> 01:44:41,140
Throw a coin at the bull. I'm not going to shoot the bull. I'm going to just shoot it in the air.

744
01:44:45,829 --> 01:44:52,500
You're not going to walk in it? God damn it.

745
01:45:02,310 --> 01:45:13,510
I know they're here. We're like every time at El Paso. I have to go get this dumb thing.

746
01:45:16,729 --> 01:45:21,770
I just need a few seconds. We have to get. I have to get up here and then throw a coin from here.

747
01:45:22,489 --> 01:45:28,569
It's possible that I could hit it from here though. Let's see. When it gets on, I'll try it.

748
01:45:33,130 --> 01:45:38,630
Why would a bull give a shit about a coin sound? Do it now? Doesn't he have to be riding it?

749
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:46,680
Doesn't he ride it? I'm trying to like have him break his neck, right?

750
01:45:49,880 --> 01:46:01,460
I'm just getting warm. You hear me? Next time I'll have you watch heads or tails.

751
01:46:02,260 --> 01:46:08,760
That didn't work. Let's raise some hell. Okay. Then we're ready for it.

752
01:46:12,039 --> 01:46:22,069
It's not scaring them. It's not scary. The bull's not scared. You guys that have

753
01:46:23,270 --> 01:46:33,350
everybody was telling me to throw a coin at the bull. Shoot them. I we're like every time

754
01:46:33,350 --> 01:46:36,390
at El Paso. All right. Well, that's not going to work. We have to find something else that has to

755
01:46:36,390 --> 01:46:45,960
happen. Hit the bull. So I got to sneak back there. So this guy has to die. Okay. I'm ready.

756
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:57,140
It's now or never. I just need a few seconds. Not worth my time. Hey, it's the two chokers.

757
01:46:59,659 --> 01:47:12,789
Here it goes. The coin. No, I have to sneak around and hit the bull. What's up? I just need a few

758
01:47:12,789 --> 01:47:20,840
seconds. Let's get going in it. He's so slow. That's the problem. All right. Let's go save

759
01:47:22,149 --> 01:47:32,729
kill these two. I can't just run and shoot them. The whole game attacks you. All right. Hold on.

760
01:47:32,729 --> 01:47:35,979
That's good moving amigo. I'll use my singing voice.

761
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:43,560
Don't let him get you boss. You know, I'm going to walk over here.

762
01:47:44,279 --> 01:47:54,090
Okay. Come on. What? Oh, it's he's got a poncho on. I have. He has to just die.

763
01:47:54,970 --> 01:48:01,460
Can we get this over with? Let's lure someone in.

764
01:48:03,539 --> 01:48:07,619
Get on with it. This guy's going to walk over getting a bit crowded. Sure thing.

765
01:48:10,699 --> 01:48:23,369
Get over here. What? Nobody messes with that. Make some noise. I like it. I heard that

766
01:48:25,060 --> 01:48:30,100
the more the merrier. Why won't he walk over here? This guy doesn't have a poncho on.

767
01:48:32,380 --> 01:48:36,460
This guy has a poncho on. This guy doesn't have a poncho on. Why is he not listening?

768
01:48:36,460 --> 01:48:42,119
Throw a coin at the trap. That's not going to do anything. Lots of these.

769
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:48,300
Okay. Here's the chance. Here's here. Keep your eyes. I'll use my singing voice.

770
01:48:50,300 --> 01:49:05,399
What? Still got it. Let's do this. David, why don't you go get him?

771
01:49:06,119 --> 01:49:15,210
Had to drag me into this. All right. Yeah, I'll get that. I need that. There she is.

772
01:49:16,010 --> 01:49:20,090
All right. Let's fucking kill this asshole right here. Right now. Time to use Bianca.

773
01:49:20,090 --> 01:49:22,810
Might have a poncho, but that doesn't particularly fucking hike in the head.

774
01:49:24,250 --> 01:49:29,350
Okay. Now I can safely go get you. The other guy's not walking around. Let's go.

775
01:49:29,750 --> 01:49:40,359
And up. No problem. Let's see.

776
01:49:46,420 --> 01:49:48,899
Crap again. What do you think? Yeah. Oh yeah. Just like old time,

777
01:49:48,899 --> 01:49:51,779
that'd be all guys ready. Check this shit out. Once this guy turns around,

778
01:49:52,659 --> 01:50:04,569
this guy has this patrol. I'm going to, I'm going to whistle him over here. Get out of here. Move.

779
01:50:04,569 --> 01:50:17,479
Leave. Leave. I just need a few seconds. They won't see us. Let's go. Looks like a job.

780
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:29,579
Oh, I heard that. No, I don't want you to come over here. I want you.

781
01:50:30,539 --> 01:50:34,859
You show that bull who's boss boss. Well, I'll break that.

782
01:50:36,779 --> 01:50:40,810
There we go. All right. If it doesn't work out, just fucking throw a knife at him.

783
01:50:41,770 --> 01:50:48,649
Watch and learn. Don't think you can hide. God damn it. Nobody move. Nobody move. Nobody move.

784
01:50:48,649 --> 01:50:57,819
Just don't move.

785
01:51:10,149 --> 01:51:13,989
Like I'm making like a fucked up YouTube video proving that he could

786
01:51:13,989 --> 01:51:29,779
withstand a bear trap. Why would he? Why would you do that? Well, okay.

787
01:51:30,579 --> 01:51:34,279
We're going to go this way and I got a feeling we'll be able to knock this guy out. I'm going

788
01:51:34,279 --> 01:51:38,810
to throw a knife at him. This trick in the book and the knife.

789
01:51:45,319 --> 01:51:59,560
Oh, fuck. Duck. Duck. Get the fuck in there, dude. Hurry up. Oh, no. He's going to see him.

790
01:52:03,100 --> 01:52:06,779
Hey, if you see him, shoot to kill. No one's going to check.

791
01:52:07,180 --> 01:52:13,449
Stay in here. You got to find him. Anybody find him? I'll smoke him out. I'll be fine.

792
01:52:16,069 --> 01:52:19,670
Stay the hell stay away from here somewhere. Where are they?

793
01:52:19,670 --> 01:52:22,550
It's not going to be a soft lock. This is just they're going to go back to normal.

794
01:52:26,069 --> 01:52:31,350
I know they're here. Sneaky motherfuckers. They got to be around here somewhere.

795
01:52:32,149 --> 01:52:42,520
Okay. Good. Save it. We got I'm going to pick him up. Do they care? Are they going to come back and be like, oh, shit, I bought it.

796
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:47,819
Or does it not matter anymore? Oh, you're damn right. I need that knife. I'm the best.

797
01:53:02,810 --> 01:53:14,300
Well, now let's see. Back in business. Yeah. Who needs a good killing?

798
01:53:24,470 --> 01:53:29,029
We're going to do this quick. Knife will do. Okay. All right. You get up there and act.

799
01:53:29,029 --> 01:53:33,640
Let's go. We're going to hear this right there. What the fuck?

800
01:53:48,619 --> 01:54:01,449
No more surprises. These guys are hiding good here. Whoever finds them gets their stuff.

801
01:54:01,529 --> 01:54:06,470
I'm here, amigo. It's like a job. Don't let them get away.

802
01:54:09,750 --> 01:54:16,069
Search everywhere. I got it. Look. Oh, they didn't see me. He didn't see. He didn't see.

803
01:54:16,069 --> 01:54:19,909
It's okay. And look, it doesn't matter. I'm going to show time. We're going to kill all three of them.

804
01:54:23,670 --> 01:54:27,189
Okay. Good. Good. Now show. Show. Stop. We're going to go coin on you.

805
01:54:27,829 --> 01:54:30,869
Okay. You're going to get up and you're going to hit the guy in the next. Go for it.

806
01:54:30,949 --> 01:54:42,409
Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink. Use your guns. I got it. Wait,

807
01:54:42,409 --> 01:54:54,659
why am I? Okay. What's fine? You can shoot

808
01:54:54,659 --> 01:55:02,100
once. Yeah. But then like the whole town gets alerted. Not a problem. Son of a bitch.

809
01:55:11,899 --> 01:55:24,060
We're fine. That's an overreaction. The old and the new. Sure. Thank

810
01:55:24,060 --> 01:55:26,060
I

811
01:55:29,979 --> 01:55:33,239
Have to be patient I have to be patient

812

1253
02:43:08,440 --> 02:43:10,440
But then they tore half the place down

1254
02:43:10,920 --> 02:43:16,680
Whoever ordered this wants these people gone. You mean vincent devitt railroad boss if you say so

02:44:40,620 --> 02:44:43,100
Isn't it so clear that it was the guys that were just in the room

1263
02:44:45,440 --> 02:44:47,879

02:47:48,760 --> 02:47:55,079
So why ruin it, huh? Look i'm not here to play the good samaritan. We both know he's working for david

1298
02:47:55,159 --> 02:47:57,159
So just tell me where he is

1299
02:47:57,719 --> 02:47:59,719
So there's no first person to go

1300
02:48:01,049 --> 02:48:06,489
Last person the last one that was really fun. He's at the mayor's house, although everybody hated it right right up the mountain

1301
02:48:06,969 --> 02:48:10,969
No reason to waste any more time then you sure this is a good idea

1302
02:48:11,610 --> 02:48:13,629
It's getting late

1303
02:48:13,629 --> 02:48:15,629
I put this off long enough

1304
02:48:16,270 --> 02:48:18,270
What difference is one more day?

1305
02:48:18,909 --> 02:48:21,149
Where I know frank he'll still be there tomorrow

1306
02:48:22,809 --> 02:48:25,450
all right

1307
02:48:25,450 --> 02:48:27,930
Tomorrow then that's right amigo

1308
02:48:29,049 --> 02:48:30,569
now

1309
02:48:30,569 --> 02:48:34,969
Tell me what you've been up to. That's a really detailed message. I don't even know what it means. So i'm not going to answer it

1310
02:48:43,079 --> 02:48:44,799
Okay

1311
02:48:44,799 --> 02:48:46,799
Make the deaths look like accidents

1312
02:48:48,440 --> 02:48:50,440
What was the oh the girl?

1313
02:48:50,700 --> 02:48:56,219
Don't kill or knock out anyone in the train track area that didn't happen. Don't touch any bushes or haystacks. How would you do that?

1314
02:48:58,809 --> 02:49:01,290
Kill three mission targets at the same time

1315
02:49:03,520 --> 02:49:08,649
What do you poison her drink?

1316
02:49:09,870 --> 02:49:11,149
obviously

1317
02:49:11,149 --> 02:49:16,840
You then split them up and knock him down with a show stopper and do the coin in the bowl

1318
02:49:17,559 --> 02:49:23,040
See what happened

1319
02:49:23,040 --> 02:49:29,899
But we started here. Okay, we'll do times uh times 16

1320
02:49:30,540 --> 02:49:38,840
I remember this part being really really hard for no reason. I don't know why

1321
02:49:40,280 --> 02:49:47,659
Circled do not do not

1322
02:49:48,299 --> 02:49:58,600
Please do not make

1323
02:49:58,600 --> 02:50:14,440
Thank you. We came all the way back down here

1324
02:50:15,159 --> 02:50:20,670
It's the bull part. Yeah, I didn't do this right

1325
02:50:21,309 --> 02:50:29,440
It's gonna be a lot of saves

1326
02:50:29,440 --> 02:50:39,690
Okay. Now the real four hour long joke here

1327
02:50:40,329 --> 02:50:45,690
Would be if I made sure that i've walked on the map in a way that I've spelled out. Fuck you

1328
02:50:46,329 --> 02:50:50,239
Now that's the real four hour joke

1329
02:50:50,319 --> 02:50:55,239
I'm not sure i'm willing to do it

1330
02:50:55,239 --> 02:50:57,239
And I just play the game and i'm playing terribly

1331
02:50:57,639 --> 02:51:01,079
And everyone's like why is he playing like such shit? This is terrible. Like why is he doing it like this?

1332
02:51:01,079 --> 02:51:03,079
This is like absolutely brainless

1333
02:51:03,479 --> 02:51:06,040
And then at the end you see that I just spelled out. Fuck you

1334
02:51:08,440 --> 02:51:24,540
Maybe too long how many saves 32 reloads or two saves where are they right here?

1335
02:51:27,639 --> 02:51:31,559
All right, hold on because I went is this when I was the one I went back to get the knife

1336
02:51:33,040 --> 02:51:45,129
Right. It's so inefficient

1337
02:52:04,959 --> 02:52:13,709
The life of a camper this would just be embarrassing if you showed this back to me

1338
02:52:13,709 --> 02:52:15,709
If I was playing like call of duty or something

1339
02:52:16,110 --> 02:52:24,909
Did you ever eat it's you need to eat human meat. It's human meat

1340
02:52:26,139 --> 02:52:29,819
I'm not gonna eat. I would never eat human meat. What the fuck are you talking about?

1341
02:52:38,909 --> 02:52:57,360
Not even a little no never not once ever. Hey, we did it

1342
02:52:57,979 --> 02:53:00,389
53 minutes

1343
02:53:00,389 --> 02:53:02,389
65 loads

1344
02:53:03,479 --> 02:53:05,159
That's a lot. Okay

1345
02:53:05,159 --> 02:53:07,500
65

1346
02:53:07,500 --> 02:53:15,100
65 saves. Okay. I seem to like to play as cooper more than any other character, I guess

1347
02:53:17,979 --> 02:53:22,270
What civilian died?

1348
02:53:22,270 --> 02:53:24,270
One civilian died. Who was it?

1349
02:53:24,590 --> 02:53:35,680
I don't know who that is. What if a human was prepared by a master chef?

1350
02:53:36,729 --> 02:53:39,549
No, it's not gonna happen

1351
02:53:39,629 --> 02:53:42,270
All right. I gotta pee when I come back. We're gonna do my food pyramid

1352
02:53:42,430 --> 02:53:44,590
I'm gonna show because everyone was talking shit about what I eat

1353
02:53:45,389 --> 02:53:47,149
Do my food pyramid

1354
02:53:47,149 --> 02:56:47,729
Be right back. So people ask in the pre-streams

1355
02:56:48,430 --> 02:56:53,340
Whatever the thing that happened before I turned on the live stream. We're talking about food

1356
02:56:54,059 --> 02:56:57,260
I was trying to talk my case about how I eat peanut butter

1357
02:56:58,719 --> 02:57:01,360
That's insane. Apparently eating peanut butter is fucking crazy

1358
02:57:02,079 --> 02:57:04,079
Eating peanut butter is like eating humans

1359
02:57:04,799 --> 02:57:06,399
To a lot of you

1360
02:57:06,399 --> 02:57:10,239
But we'll go over we'll talk about it. So I have over here

1361
02:57:10,959 --> 02:57:14,440
Is down you don't hear this fucking music right now

1362
02:57:15,659 --> 02:57:18,989
Okay, let's go. So what do you have in front of you?

1363
02:57:20,239 --> 02:57:21,520
is

1364
02:57:21,520 --> 02:57:24,120
It is a pyramid

1365
02:57:24,120 --> 02:57:25,319
now most

1366
02:57:25,319 --> 02:57:27,319
Really long long time ago

1367
02:57:27,319 --> 02:57:29,000
The pyramid used to be

1368
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:33,309
Like this, you know, this is back in like the fucking 30s. It was like

1369
02:57:38,489 --> 02:57:40,489
Like this. Well, why is it the weird color?

1370
02:57:41,049 --> 02:57:46,489
This was essentially the food pyramid back in like fucking 1938 or like 1940. Whatever 1950

1371
02:57:47,129 --> 02:57:55,719
I'm gonna select it. Okay. You had bread and beer

1372
02:57:56,280 --> 02:57:58,280
I think my computer crashed

1373
02:58:04,040 --> 02:58:05,600
Fuck

1374
02:58:05,600 --> 02:58:14,000
No, wait, hold on. What the fuck is going on my computer?

1375
02:58:19,239 --> 02:58:23,790
What stop how do I get rid of this?

1376
02:58:24,590 --> 02:58:38,520
Where's the brushes?

1377
02:58:38,600 --> 02:58:40,799
Okay, honestly

1378
02:58:40,799 --> 02:58:44,639
Where's the brush? How do I get rid of this? Holy shit. What the hell was that?

1379
02:58:46,760 --> 02:58:49,579
All right. Anyways, here we go

1380
02:58:52,379 --> 02:58:57,370
What do I eat the least of the thing that I eat the least of let's put it up here

1381
02:58:57,370 --> 02:59:01,530
This is because you a pyramid supposed to be this is what you eat the least of all right, and this is dead serious

1382
02:59:02,090 --> 02:59:06,569
I do not eat anymore really at all. I don't have dairy ever

1383
02:59:07,209 --> 02:59:09,209
Literally ever not ass

1384
02:59:10,059 --> 02:59:16,040
Dairy like milk. I don't eat drink. I don't eat milk. I don't have it fucks me up. I have

1385
02:59:16,680 --> 02:59:23,559
It has now I have intestinal diarrhea problems. So milk does not really do well for me anymore. So up here is milk

1386
02:59:24,200 --> 02:59:29,629
This is this is like milk

1387
02:59:29,629 --> 02:59:32,270
And can we not make it like 600 font, please?

1388
02:59:34,959 --> 02:59:36,000
milk

1389
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:39,469
Okay

1390
02:59:39,469 --> 02:59:48,159
Milk that's way too fucking small there milk dairy cheese

1391
02:59:49,979 --> 02:59:57,209
I don't eat any of these things really at all anymore. Not good for me. It doesn't do it for me. I can't do it

1392
02:59:57,610 --> 03:00:06,059
That's probably what I eat the least. What about pizza? I don't eat pizza anymore. I don't I really just don't I swear to god

1393
03:00:06,459 --> 03:00:10,860
I promise. All right. What do I eat the most of what I here's what I eat the most of

1394
03:00:11,610 --> 03:00:17,950
I most of my food comes from shit. This is kind of weird like the biggest

1395
03:00:18,670 --> 03:00:27,159
It's not bread bread's like here. This is i'm gonna make this would be bread

1396
03:00:29,719 --> 03:00:35,000
I don't really eat bread. I try to always stay away from white bread wheat bread. That doesn't sit well with me either

1397
03:00:36,170 --> 03:00:41,209
Also all these medical problems. I've been trying to have a better diet, but I never really ate that much bread anyways

1398
03:00:42,969 --> 03:00:49,079
It's chocolate milk. No, not milk. I don't drink milk. So this would be bread

1399
03:00:52,000 --> 03:00:53,520
and flour

1400
03:00:53,520 --> 03:00:59,930
Bread and flour what bread flour pasta?

1401
03:01:01,309 --> 03:01:06,620
I don't eat. I don't eat it. And then the next thing

1402
03:01:10,139 --> 03:01:25,200
Okay, what I eat the most probably turkey. Yeah, it's definitely tur I eat turkeys number one turkey

1403
03:01:26,600 --> 03:01:34,040
Uh, yeah, definitely turkey. I have turkey for four times a week

1404
03:01:36,379 --> 03:01:44,360
Four three or four times a week. I will eat turkey but also turkey and chicken I think are on this list here

1405
03:01:47,819 --> 03:01:53,049
No, no, it's not even true. That's really not it. That's a lie turkey. I eat the most turkeys all turkey

1406
03:01:53,450 --> 03:02:04,809
I'm a huge turkey guy. All right. Well, I can't move this but whatever you get the idea the poultry

1407
03:02:05,500 --> 03:02:10,860
Yeah, but I eat turkey way more than chicken just because turkey's a lot leaner doesn't have a lot of fat in it

1408
03:02:10,940 --> 03:02:13,819
It's just much better for you. It's I like it. I love it a whisk captain crunch

1409
03:02:14,840 --> 03:02:19,950
Okay, i'm gonna show you guys what I might what it used to be. This is what it is now healthy

1410
03:02:19,950 --> 03:02:32,489
I'm trying to be a healthy person. I will show you what my food pyramid used to be I promise up here

1411
03:02:33,600 --> 03:02:39,899
You've got probably fish salmon tuna. Let's do that

1412
03:02:40,459 --> 03:02:45,200
Salmon's pink. So I eat a shitload of salmon. I'd eat a shitload of tuna

1413
03:02:45,360 --> 03:02:52,540
I eat a lot of it. I eat more turkey than I eat tuna. You know, i'm gonna write fish

1414
03:02:55,600 --> 03:02:57,209
there fish

1415
03:02:57,209 --> 03:02:58,729
Turkey number one

1416
03:02:58,729 --> 03:03:04,969
My main source of food is turkey and then fish and then right here underneath that you got your vegetables. This is green vegetables kale

1417
03:03:05,510 --> 03:03:20,139
Broccoli spinach. I'm a huge baby kale fan. Let's do that. So that's like about right here fill that in

1418
03:03:20,540 --> 03:03:22,780
I'm trying to i'm really trying to be accurate with this

1419
03:03:24,079 --> 03:03:29,840
Greens there green. Yeah, there's a lot of greens

1420
03:03:34,170 --> 03:03:37,129
And then there's a whole lot of shit in here that it kind of doesn't exist

1421
03:03:39,680 --> 03:03:42,959
I do really eat just like a bunch of green vegetables fish and turkey

1422
03:03:46,079 --> 03:03:50,159
And then also very important right underneath this is nuts and seeds

1423
03:03:51,719 --> 03:03:56,040
I want to change this color because I like this. This is more of like a bread and pasta color

1424
03:03:58,190 --> 03:04:00,680
Yeah, like that's better

1425
03:04:00,680 --> 03:04:06,329
Up next you got probably fruits. I eat a shitload of bananas

1426
03:04:06,409 --> 03:04:09,850
I shoot a little blueberries bananas are my favorite thing in the world. You're eating a there's a bird diet

1427
03:04:10,170 --> 03:04:19,159
Not it was not a bird diet yet bird diet would be seeds down here. I eat turkey. I eat the birds

1428
03:04:20,510 --> 03:04:25,469
I mean it is a bird diet because I eat mostly birds. So is that if that's what you meant then that's fine

1429
03:04:28,569 --> 03:04:30,569
Why am I getting to like the scared face?

1430
03:04:31,610 --> 03:04:35,209
You guys probably eat like a six piece chicken nugget three times a week

1431
03:04:35,209 --> 03:04:38,700
What are you talking about? Because I used to do that. I'm telling you we're gonna do my neck. We're gonna do my

1432
03:04:39,239 --> 03:04:45,520
Before pyramid, this is the after pyramid. Okay, so up here you have

1433
03:04:46,440 --> 03:04:50,809
Next is this is fruits. No, that's a fucking lie

1434
03:04:51,450 --> 03:04:56,489
That is such a lie. I'm just that's that's absolutely pretending. I eat maybe like one or two bananas

1435
03:04:57,129 --> 03:05:05,840
A week or something. It's probably up here. That's a lie. I'm gonna i'm just lying to you. Is it gonna be fruits?

1436
03:05:06,559 --> 03:05:13,209
All right, this is fruits

1437
03:05:13,209 --> 03:05:17,000
And then I gotta think of like servings a day, right?

1438
03:05:17,559 --> 03:05:21,959
Because why is that so powerful looking?

1439
03:05:21,959 --> 03:05:27,850
Okay. All right. There you go. Then you got greens your fish your turkey your fruit your bread your flour your milk

1440
03:05:28,569 --> 03:05:30,409
Your nuts and your seeds

1441
03:05:30,409 --> 03:05:40,329
Okay nuts and seeds, but probably go right above fruit. That's the nuts and seeds right there. Okay, here we go

1442
03:05:40,969 --> 03:05:43,370
By the way, this is almonds

1443
03:05:43,450 --> 03:05:48,329
No, fuck that's a lie. Oh, no, wait a minute is is it I think I think it's above greens

1444
03:05:49,520 --> 03:05:56,569
It is it definitely is I eat so much peanut butter all the time. Like it's definitely it's definitely peanut butter up here

1445
03:05:56,569 --> 03:06:17,500
It has to be this is fake. This is peanut butter. It's not greens. It's peanut butter. How do I this is

1446
03:06:18,219 --> 03:06:19,600
peanut butter

1447
03:06:19,600 --> 03:06:22,639
Sunflower seeds nuts and seeds and you know what?

1448
03:06:23,260 --> 03:06:30,909
90% of this is peanut butter. I love it. I love it so much. All right, you get the point

1449
03:06:38,889 --> 03:06:42,969
Well, it's not all peanut butter it's mostly peanut butter i'm just gonna say nuts and seeds

1450
03:06:47,319 --> 03:06:51,879
Okay, then it's vegetables. All right, there we go. Now I got it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

1451
03:06:51,879 --> 03:06:59,049
Yeah, we're good. We're good. We're good and it's greens. Wait, do I eat anything else weird? What do I drink for liquids?

1452
03:07:02,459 --> 03:07:04,459
It's it's probably coffee

1453
03:07:04,540 --> 03:07:08,219
But i'm trying not to drink coffee anymore. So this is the lie. It's crap. No, it's grains

1454
03:07:08,219 --> 03:07:11,340
I eat shit little kale and spinach. You guys know that i've talked about that for years

1455
03:07:12,059 --> 03:07:18,159
Drink liquid. Where is weed?

1456
03:07:19,559 --> 03:07:25,120
Don't I don't what are you talking about? Okay greens

1457
03:07:25,920 --> 03:07:29,520
Because I don't wait greens and radishes

1458
03:07:30,239 --> 03:07:32,299
Okay

1459
03:07:32,299 --> 03:07:37,469
Because I don't eat vegetables. I don't like them. I hate them. I'm just being completely honest

1460
03:07:38,799 --> 03:07:46,280
If it's not a green vegetable, I don't want it. I don't like it. I'm sorry. I'm just being honest. I love broccoli

1461
03:07:46,819 --> 03:07:48,819
spinach kale

1462
03:07:50,799 --> 03:07:55,899
And that's it. I don't like any of that. I don't the carrots are gross. I don't like them. I'm sorry

1463
03:07:55,899 --> 03:08:01,920
I don't like them. I like radishes a lot. I like

1464
03:08:02,639 --> 03:08:10,969
Regular radishes red radishes daikon radishes. I love radishes but onions no fucking no onions and garlic essentially is a condiment

1465
03:08:11,049 --> 03:08:20,030
Okay, i'm gonna put that in condiments. I love radishes. They like the best red radishes are like my favorite

1466
03:08:20,030 --> 03:08:27,930
I love radishes. Okay, the greens and radishes coming up next you got condiments. I eat. Okay

1467
03:08:27,930 --> 03:08:35,370
This is not even a lie either. I think I mean a lot of my diet is like mayonnaise

1468
03:08:35,770 --> 03:08:49,899
I probably eat as much mayonnaise as I do green vegetables. Do I I think I might okay

1469
03:08:50,860 --> 03:09:06,090
I'm gonna write mayonnaise slash condiments. No, that's fucked up. I don't eat that much mayonnaise. Do I?

1470
03:09:06,729 --> 03:09:11,950
Okay, here's the thing. I have to ask do I eat more mayonnaise than I do fruit? Yes

1471
03:09:12,729 --> 03:09:20,239
I am certain of that. I'm telling you right now. That's 100 certain. I absolutely eat more mayonnaise than fruit

1472
03:09:21,100 --> 03:09:23,340
I eat a banana like maybe two or three times a week

1473
03:09:23,420 --> 03:09:30,299
I put mayonnaise on everything in my tuna my fish I mayonnaise on my turkey sandwiches mayonnaise

1474
03:09:32,030 --> 03:09:41,530
In my aiolis mayonnaise all every day mayonnaise plus i'm gonna write mayonnaise plus

1475
03:09:41,770 --> 03:09:44,729
It could be like it'd be like I don't but mustard sucks mayonnaise is the best

1476
03:09:45,049 --> 03:09:53,469
What about peanut butter that goes over here? That's in the nuts and seeds. It's no no wonder you're so sick

1477
03:09:55,239 --> 03:10:02,840
No, I definitely just eat way I eat more. I eat more mayonnaise than fruit. I eat more mayonnaise than dairy

1478
03:10:02,840 --> 03:10:04,840
I eat more mayonnaise than flour and bread

1479
03:10:05,479 --> 03:10:07,479
I don't eat all these other things

1480
03:10:08,040 --> 03:10:10,600
I eat mayonnaise

1481
03:10:10,680 --> 03:10:15,319
More than I do bread. I've had mayonnaise more times in the last week than a piece of bread

1482
03:10:15,319 --> 03:10:23,680
That's a fact and plus who gives it's just whipped up eggs and fucking oil. It's good for you. Just don't eat it every day

1483
03:10:24,399 --> 03:10:26,829
Don't have it in your pyramid. Okay

1484
03:10:27,549 --> 03:10:34,239
Listen that leaves us with I don't know. What else is what else do you eat?

1485
03:10:36,750 --> 03:10:45,309
What what hey what is here what drinks potatoes

1486
03:10:47,440 --> 03:10:53,049
I don't eat I don't eat them. I don't eat potatoes. What about sugar and sweets?

1487
03:10:55,290 --> 03:11:02,760
That's changed recently too. I'm gonna make it like cotton candy color

1488
03:11:06,079 --> 03:11:10,620
I don't I barely eat any like zero

1489
03:11:14,510 --> 03:11:17,629
You want to know where I get my sugar content from at the point at this point right now?

1490
03:11:17,870 --> 03:11:20,239
This is gonna be like I know people are gonna go. Haha

1491
03:11:20,959 --> 03:11:27,709
Yeah from from like whatever is in the marijuana edible that I have I'm sorry, but I have to tell you the truth

1492
03:11:28,190 --> 03:11:36,780
I have to tell you the truth

1493
03:11:36,780 --> 03:11:39,840
There okay

1494
03:11:39,840 --> 03:11:43,200
It's it's right at the top. It did it it won it won the game

1495
03:11:44,459 --> 03:11:46,459
All right. Now what what else do I eat?

1496
03:11:46,860 --> 03:11:50,219
Lots of turkey lots of fish and remember when I write turkey here

1497
03:11:50,219 --> 03:11:53,420
Let's let's I gotta clarify this because people are gonna think i'm fucking psycho

1498
03:11:53,979 --> 03:11:55,979
I will clarify this turkey

1499
03:11:56,680 --> 03:11:58,680
slash poultry

1500
03:12:01,000 --> 03:12:03,000
Oh, how do you spell poultry?

1501
03:12:03,079 --> 03:12:08,569
Because people are gonna be like what the fuck dude eat and you eat you only eat four things. No, no, no, no, this is

1502
03:12:09,209 --> 03:12:15,319
You understand it's mostly turkey deal mostly turkey and poultry like chicken turkey

1503
03:12:18,190 --> 03:12:25,629
I would just write poultry, but I don't want to because 90% of it's turkey. Do you understand? What about rice?

1504
03:12:26,649 --> 03:12:30,430
Oh, uh

1505
03:12:30,430 --> 03:12:38,639
No rice is probably okay. I'm gonna split this this is getting split in half. Oh, no, it's gonna split. Yeah, let's go like this

1506
03:12:41,340 --> 03:12:45,469
This is probably rice

1507
03:12:45,469 --> 03:12:48,409
Uh, what should rice be?

1508
03:12:48,489 --> 03:12:50,489
Let's just do like a like a dark

1509
03:12:50,729 --> 03:13:02,000
Like here, I don't know it's the color of the background shit, um was a good I need about a cup of milk

1510
03:13:06,590 --> 03:13:29,549
God damn it. What the fuck are you doing? Stop? You're ruining everything. Okay. What is pot? What color is pasta?

1511
03:13:30,909 --> 03:13:32,909
Like I want to just do this one. Whatever

1512
03:13:33,069 --> 03:13:36,680
Okay, that's fine. Who cares

1513
03:13:36,680 --> 03:13:40,840
So through what was I doing? Oh, yeah, I was splitting this into thirds because this is rice rice is right here

1514
03:13:45,959 --> 03:13:47,959
Well, I eat more rice than mayonnaise

1515
03:13:48,959 --> 03:13:50,989
I mean, I don't know

1516
03:13:50,989 --> 03:13:55,260
I really don't know

1517
03:13:55,260 --> 03:14:07,420
maybe

1518
03:14:07,420 --> 03:14:09,420
You put mayo on rice

1519
03:14:10,700 --> 03:14:13,100
No, I don't I just know I use it more often

1520
03:14:14,139 --> 03:14:16,139
All right rice is right there

1521
03:14:16,840 --> 03:14:19,579
and

1522
03:14:19,579 --> 03:14:21,020
I definitely eat more

1523
03:14:21,020 --> 03:14:23,639
How do you consume that much mayonnaise?

1524
03:14:24,959 --> 03:14:27,680
This is my weekly pyramid. This is not my daily pyramid

1525
03:14:28,319 --> 03:14:32,559
This is like my like my weekly fuck. That's a lot of mayonnaise. Um

1526
03:14:33,280 --> 03:14:39,040
I'm trying to think about okay. When do I eat mayonnaise in the morning?

1527
03:14:40,360 --> 03:14:41,879
No, where eggs?

1528
03:14:41,879 --> 03:14:43,709
Where eggs?

1529
03:14:43,709 --> 03:14:45,069
Eggs are up here

1530
03:14:45,069 --> 03:14:47,870
I eat eggs

1531
03:14:47,870 --> 03:14:52,959
I don't eat pork at all. I don't eat red meat either

1532
03:14:53,440 --> 03:15:01,739
What does that go? All right, it has to go above sugar. No red meat fell off the fucking cliff. Okay red meats

1533
03:15:01,819 --> 03:15:03,819
I don't eat it any I don't I don't eat it at all

1534
03:15:06,959 --> 03:15:10,639
Like literally i'm gonna throw like fucking throw lines like it fell off the goddamn mountain

1535
03:15:22,280 --> 03:15:26,200
Yeah, like sugar threw red meat and it buried it in the ocean

1536
03:15:26,680 --> 03:15:34,430
Okay, no, I don't eat nobody better. I don't eat any red meat anymore at all. What about steak?

1537
03:15:34,590 --> 03:15:36,750
It's not anymore that was just for a stream gag

1538
03:15:38,459 --> 03:15:41,739
Not anymore. Wait, this is my we're gonna do my other pyramid after this. I promise

1539
03:15:43,690 --> 03:15:45,690
I will show you what I used to eat like

1540
03:15:46,170 --> 03:15:51,450
Up until about like a year ago the mayonnaise. I'm not the the I always have mayonnaise on the brain

1541
03:15:51,450 --> 03:15:53,930
The red meat thing was just a gag for the stream. I don't eat red meat

1542
03:15:54,829 --> 03:16:00,350
Although I I I shouted that out all the time. I said how much I loved it. I did but not anymore

1543
03:16:03,079 --> 03:16:12,879
Okay, let's put eggs in here eggs

1544
03:16:13,360 --> 03:16:20,670
That makes sense to me

1545
03:16:20,670 --> 03:16:24,040
If I want I really do wonder if this belongs here

1546
03:16:26,489 --> 03:16:28,889
I don't know if this belongs. I think it belongs above mayonnaise

1547
03:16:29,690 --> 03:16:32,700
I don't eat eggs at every meal. I eat mayonnaise at every meal

1548
03:16:33,500 --> 03:16:35,260
besides at breakfast

1549
03:16:35,260 --> 03:16:41,579
That's is that true though?

1550
03:16:41,579 --> 03:16:46,540
All right. What about um

1551
03:16:46,540 --> 03:16:51,120
Mayo is eggs. What about the legs?

1552
03:16:54,459 --> 03:16:56,459
Eggs are dairy. Um

1553
03:16:59,360 --> 03:17:01,690
Uh, no, they're not

1554
03:17:01,690 --> 03:17:04,729
Like they are not dairy eggs are not dairy. I know that

1555
03:17:05,290 --> 03:17:16,540
No, what about easy baked oven meals? They are eggs are not dairy. They come from a chicken's ass. What are you talking about?

1556
03:17:17,180 --> 03:17:22,729
Is a chicken a cow cows don't lay eggs

1557
03:17:23,600 --> 03:17:31,639
They do live birth. Yeah, it's not from a cow. It's not dairy means from a dairy means

1558
03:17:32,180 --> 03:17:49,370
Milk-based prove it. Okay, you would like to go for on a tour at a farm. I'm going to ask the farmer

1559
03:17:50,540 --> 03:17:54,940
Hey, are eggs dairy? No, they're not

1560
03:17:56,319 --> 03:18:00,319
I thought you learned that in the third grade when you went with your class

1561
03:18:01,610 --> 03:18:07,309
To the look at how old everything is exhibit on the field trip when you were like eight

1562
03:18:08,559 --> 03:18:19,229
And they were all the actors and they all pretended to be from like the pilgrim times. You don't remember that apparently

1563
03:18:25,389 --> 03:18:32,590
What goes here though? What else do I eat? I definitely eat eggs more than no. I don't I think I do

1564
03:18:33,309 --> 03:18:39,479
I eat rice eggs and uh, what else what about beans? There you go. Bingo. Yep. That's right

1565
03:18:42,909 --> 03:18:46,110
Why does this keep happening? I swear to god this thing has a mind of its own

1566
03:18:47,040 --> 03:18:48,360
beans

1567
03:18:48,360 --> 03:18:55,659
All right. There you go. There is my food pyramid. That is currently how I live my life at the moment

1568
03:18:56,379 --> 03:19:03,319
Mayonnaise may be below fruit. I may have overdone it a little onions and garlic are in there too, by the way

1569
03:19:03,799 --> 03:19:16,219
This is mayonnaise plus this mayonnaise onions and garlic. What about what about drinks? Okay. I'll make another drink pyramid

1570
03:19:31,239 --> 03:19:37,520
Here's here is it. Here it is. Here is my drink pyramid

1571
03:19:37,840 --> 03:19:51,579
Is it only two things that I consume as of I literally have been trying to switch to tea

1572
03:19:52,670 --> 03:20:02,719
I don't that's it. What about wine? I haven't guys I haven't drank

1573
03:20:04,170 --> 03:20:07,629
in a very long time

1574
03:20:07,790 --> 03:20:15,229
Wine would be on here, but I haven't I have not drank alcohol in quite a while. It's been months

1575
03:20:15,629 --> 03:20:21,899
What about tea? Yeah water and coffee, you know, and I you have to if I drink one coffee I do

1576
03:20:21,979 --> 03:20:26,940
I it's a diuretic. I gotta be careful. I'm trying to go to uh, black tea and green tea now

1577
03:20:27,500 --> 03:20:31,719
There you go. There there it is. I made it

1578
03:20:32,700 --> 03:20:35,180
Now tell me what's wrong with this besides the mayonnaise plus

1579
03:20:38,319 --> 03:20:42,239
I don't need any red meat. I don't need any sugar milk and dairy. I don't eat very off

1580
03:20:42,319 --> 03:20:44,479
No bread really that no no fruits a little bit

1581
03:20:45,040 --> 03:20:51,760
Rice eggs and beans sometimes mayonnaise plus onions and garlic all the time greens radishes all the time nuts and seeds

1582
03:20:52,159 --> 03:20:59,239
Almonds peanut butter peanuts walnuts cashews. Eh, not really throw those in the trash

1583
03:20:59,559 --> 03:21:05,159
Don't throw those in the trash. If you don't want them donate them. Don't be an idiot fish. We're talking tuna

1584
03:21:05,639 --> 03:21:08,969
Salmon, we're talking

1585
03:21:08,969 --> 03:21:17,040
Sushi. Yep. I love it turkey poultry chicken. We're talking chicken fingers

1586
03:21:17,120 --> 03:21:19,120
We're talking turkey bird patties

1587
03:21:19,520 --> 03:21:23,360
Turkey ground turkey on top of look at this check at this

1588
03:21:23,520 --> 03:21:27,120
I'll show you some fucking combos you can do with this pyramid. You got your turkey patty

1589
03:21:27,899 --> 03:21:31,420
Combo that on top of the rice. That's brown rice

1590
03:21:31,899 --> 03:21:36,590
Turkey just fucking sprinkle a little bit of spinach on there. There you go

1591
03:21:37,229 --> 03:21:46,590
Done there's a full meal. You're ready. I don't need any of this shit. I'm kidding. That's gross

1592
03:21:48,110 --> 03:21:53,079
What's gross about having like a like a little some like a turkey like some like a nice pan

1593
03:21:53,399 --> 03:21:59,559
Seared turkey patty on top of a thing of brown rice with some kale on top with some chopped mayonnaise plus on it

1594
03:21:59,799 --> 03:22:11,629
We're talking garlic. What's wrong with that? You put your mayo in your drinks. No, I don't put mayo in it

1595
03:22:11,709 --> 03:22:19,370
Why would I do that? There's another one for you. You got a nice you toast up some you got some nice toasted almonds

1596
03:22:19,690 --> 03:22:28,219
You have a nice nice piece of salmon. Okay, chop up those almonds throw that away. That's not a real recipe

1597
03:22:28,299 --> 03:22:31,819
I'm just trying to make up stuff. All right, so you take the radishes. No, how do you do this?

1598
03:22:32,219 --> 03:22:40,010

Don't touch it put it skin side down in the pan into the oven 450 degrees

1603
03:23:09,180 --> 03:23:13,559
It's 12 minutes take it out. Don't fucking touch it. Let it sit there for a second

1604
03:23:13,559 --> 03:23:20,780
It's gonna be the best piece of salmon you've ever had in your whole life greens take some mayonnaise plus which is take a little bit

Okay, cook it down really toast to roast up that garlic in that pan take your greens

1607
03:23:33,530 --> 03:23:38,479
Grab some kale throw the greens in there when it's hot shake it around 10 seconds

1608
03:23:38,719 --> 03:23:43,530
Get that thing out of there lay it next to the salmon after it comes out bingo

1609
03:23:43,610 --> 03:23:53,899
You've got yourself a salmon and kale garlic dinner burn the garlic. That's not what you've done in burn the garlic

03:23:53,979 --> 03:24:01,600
I got it nice and roasted. Yeah sunflower seeds

Take a take take a half take a quarter pound of turkey dump sunflower seeds on it roasted toasted put it in the oven

1612
03:24:08,940 --> 03:24:15,600
125 degrees for 10 minutes dump mayonnaise on top of when it comes out eat a bowl of rice while you wait

1613
03:24:16,159 --> 03:24:20,620
Didn't know about that little fucking secret snack. Did you once that's done pull it out of the oven?

1614
03:24:21,659 --> 03:24:30,959
Uh squeeze lemon juice in your eyes and throw flour in your face and eat this as fast as you can

1615
03:24:31,200 --> 03:24:49,200
I've got a perfect pyramid doing clown makeup. Well, this is like a clown pyramid. Look, okay, that's this is it

1616
03:24:49,360 --> 03:24:52,159
It really is it I don't eat red meat. I don't eat that much sugar anymore

1617
03:24:52,159 --> 03:24:54,649
I don't take in that much milk or dairy

1618
03:24:54,649 --> 03:24:55,930
I don't mean I okay

1619
03:24:55,930 --> 03:25:01,209
Let's do you want to say what it used to be years ago before like by years ago

1620
03:25:01,209 --> 03:25:04,090
I mean like four years ago not that long ago. Let's do what it used to be

1621
03:25:04,329 --> 03:25:12,569
This is what it is now ready for this doesn't go back that far

1622
03:25:14,409 --> 03:25:16,409
Okay. Well, whatever i'm just gonna erase it

1623
03:25:20,840 --> 03:25:22,840
How would you erase yellow that it makes no sense?

1624
03:25:25,229 --> 03:25:27,309
Why perfect? He says you already took a screenshot

1625
03:25:27,950 --> 03:25:30,250
Just do the triangle tool

1626
03:25:30,250 --> 03:25:32,649
If I hold I don't want to I like this. I like the setup already

1627
03:25:33,209 --> 03:25:40,350
I thought I was gonna do new whatever how do I do like? Oh, what's the what's the command keyboard to do a new product?

1628
03:25:40,989 --> 03:25:50,270
Control what I need to know this for later control n control w file new

1629
03:25:50,350 --> 03:25:55,870
I know I know what it is, but I want to get like the real one. It's not control w. It's control n

1630
03:25:57,770 --> 03:26:03,479
No, I don't want to save

1631
03:26:03,479 --> 03:26:05,790
Okay, this is what it used to be

1632
03:26:09,920 --> 03:26:11,920
Uh, I am going to show you

1633
03:26:12,159 --> 03:26:16,440
Why you really need to take a look at your diet. It's really important shit. It really is

1634
03:26:17,899 --> 03:26:22,540
This is i'm not gonna pretend i'm not gonna lie. I'm not gonna lie to you guys. This is gonna be for real

1635
03:26:23,100 --> 03:26:28,409
No fucking around this is you're gonna see right through me, okay

1636
03:26:30,590 --> 03:26:34,829
I'm going to go with this is probably like about like maybe like a year or two ago

1637
03:26:35,309 --> 03:26:46,889
This is a shitty triangle. What's wrong with it? This is it's fine. What?

1638
03:26:48,250 --> 03:26:50,200
That's fine

1639
03:26:50,200 --> 03:26:52,440
Okay, so down here. This is what I ate the most of

1640
03:26:53,790 --> 03:26:56,569
And it's embarrassing

1641
03:26:56,569 --> 03:26:59,049
It is it it actually is it's more than that

1642
03:27:03,159 --> 03:27:07,559
This is what my what do you think my number one source of food was for a long time?

1643
03:27:14,090 --> 03:27:16,649
Chicken, yep, what but very specific

1644
03:27:17,370 --> 03:27:25,239
No, not I know. No, no, no

1645
03:27:25,479 --> 03:27:27,399
fried chicken

1646
03:27:27,399 --> 03:27:35,239
Whether that's chicken sandwich whether that's chicken strips whether that's just chicken that's been fried it like just fried up chicken

1647
03:27:38,440 --> 03:27:42,940
I'm not kidding. Maybe this is not a year ago. Maybe this is probably like a probably like three or four years ago

1648
03:27:42,940 --> 03:27:44,780
But it used to be like this

1649
03:27:44,780 --> 03:27:53,790
This is not a joke

1650
03:27:53,790 --> 03:27:59,629
Spaghetti that's pasta, which is don't worry that you it's going it's coming right next to that

1651
03:28:00,110 --> 03:28:03,930
All right. Well fried chicken is gonna be yeah, that makes sense

1652
03:28:04,569 --> 03:28:08,540
Gotta be bigger than that too. Let's do like I don't know a hundred

1653
03:28:12,219 --> 03:28:23,399
And it's gone. Okay, cool. Wait, what is he? What are you doing? Where's my cursor?

1654
03:28:23,959 --> 03:28:31,370
Whatever. That's fine fried chicken

1655
03:28:31,930 --> 03:28:40,909
Fuck mom. Don't watch she's gonna be like what I raised him on a mayonnaise diet. Why is he doing this?

1656
03:28:50,719 --> 03:28:56,889
Uh, and i'm gonna clarify underneath because people are gonna be like what the fuck is he talking about i'm gonna clarify

1657
03:28:57,850 --> 03:29:01,079
this is like

1658
03:29:01,079 --> 03:29:03,739
Sandwiches, why just write it. It's so much faster

1659
03:29:10,629 --> 03:29:12,430
sandwiches

1660
03:29:12,430 --> 03:29:13,790
strips

1661
03:29:13,790 --> 03:29:16,219
this is uh

1662
03:29:16,280 --> 03:29:20,569
Nuggets, this is uh

1663
03:29:22,680 --> 03:29:25,209
Yeah

1664
03:29:25,209 --> 03:29:29,930
Yeah

1665
03:29:29,930 --> 03:29:33,370
That's chicken sandwiches chicken strips chicken nuggets

1666
03:29:34,250 --> 03:29:36,969
Oh man, I want it right now, but no

1667
03:29:37,690 --> 03:29:39,690
Not part of my current pyramid

1668
03:29:39,770 --> 03:29:43,239
Can't be included coming up next. We have what do you think?

1669
03:29:49,180 --> 03:30:05,450
This is bread and pasta. This is bread pasta flour

1670
03:30:08,159 --> 03:30:09,899
Okay

1671
03:30:09,899 --> 03:30:12,430
bread pasta flour

1672
03:30:12,430 --> 03:30:16,670
Because the flour and the bread on the chicken makes fried chicken

1673
03:30:18,590 --> 03:30:20,590
And i've had a lot of it all the time

1674
03:30:21,870 --> 03:30:27,229
No, no flour like flour tortillas flour like white flour wheat flour like i'm talking like it's in everything

1675
03:30:27,549 --> 03:30:36,440
I used to eat a ton of it and this sucks looking at this. Okay now after this

1676
03:30:39,819 --> 03:30:43,239
okay, um

1677
03:30:43,239 --> 03:30:45,239
After that, it's probably

1678
03:30:45,799 --> 03:30:48,620
Probably like ground beef

1679
03:30:48,620 --> 03:30:51,680
like meat

1680
03:30:51,680 --> 03:31:04,639
Yeah, it's like specifically ground beef just just like red meat. It's not good

1681
03:31:05,360 --> 03:31:10,299
It's too much. Look at it. Look at how just how sad this looks too

1682
03:31:10,860 --> 03:31:16,600
What's all the color?

1683
03:31:16,600 --> 03:31:18,600
This diet isn't bad though

1684
03:31:19,879 --> 03:31:22,600
Okay, I really need you to think if

1685
03:31:23,219 --> 03:31:24,520
consuming

1686
03:31:24,520 --> 03:31:26,360
fried chicken

1687
03:31:26,360 --> 03:31:28,600
As a majority of your diet is a good idea

1688
03:31:28,920 --> 03:31:37,770
You have to think about that

1689
03:31:37,770 --> 03:31:42,889
If here's the worst part about this if you put a plate of perfect fried chicken in front of me right now

1690
03:31:43,290 --> 03:31:47,319
I would break everything and just eat it because I would be like, I don't care. I love this so much

1691
03:31:47,319 --> 03:31:49,399
I don't even give a shit. I don't care. Give it to me

1692
03:31:49,959 --> 03:31:55,530
Okay above that

1693
03:31:55,530 --> 03:31:57,530
We're gonna do okay. So

1694
03:31:59,260 --> 03:31:59,979
uh

1695
03:31:59,979 --> 03:32:02,219
Probably onions like specifically onions

1696
03:32:04,190 --> 03:32:07,389
I would do a vegetable one, but I can't even do a green one

1697
03:32:07,469 --> 03:32:29,709
So we're gonna have to do like a puke one because it was onions only. Okay onions

1698
03:32:36,729 --> 03:32:39,100
No, I want to pick it up

1699
03:32:39,100 --> 03:32:42,620
Whatever

1700
03:32:42,620 --> 03:32:45,370
What are steakums?

1701
03:32:45,450 --> 03:32:47,450
They fit in here right there

1702
03:32:51,180 --> 03:32:53,739
Lavender is not a puke color. Well, I already used the puke color. Didn't I?

1703
03:32:54,299 --> 03:32:59,239
Oh, no, I didn't but that looks good onions are like this. Yeah, that's a good onions color

1704
03:33:01,850 --> 03:33:03,850
All right, and then after that

1705
03:33:06,889 --> 03:33:14,399
Hmm. Yeah, I know it's like a gray but the background is gray. What do you what do you want me to do?

1706
03:33:14,479 --> 03:33:23,739
Look, i'm ruining everything

1707
03:33:23,739 --> 03:33:25,739
I i've got to use white for milk

1708
03:33:25,819 --> 03:33:39,180
Because that's right here. How big is it though?

1709
03:33:40,889 --> 03:33:44,120
Yeah, it's pretty big

1710
03:33:44,120 --> 03:33:46,120
Weird, you know, what's really funny about this diet

1711
03:33:46,760 --> 03:33:52,120
That we'll talk about in a minute and this is just the total just liar hypocrisy dog shit

1712
03:33:52,440 --> 03:33:58,590
That a lot of us have a problem with and i'm like i'm guilty of it too. I'll tell you in a second

1713
03:34:01,049 --> 03:34:02,569
so up here

1714
03:34:02,569 --> 03:34:04,809
Is i'm gonna put it in the same spot

1715
03:34:06,030 --> 03:34:07,290
Right there

1716
03:34:07,290 --> 03:34:09,229
Here it is

1717
03:34:09,229 --> 03:34:11,229
This is sugar sweets and candy

1718
03:34:12,239 --> 03:34:17,200
And I remember telling everybody and telling friends and family like oh do you want like to get dessert? No, no

1719
03:34:17,280 --> 03:34:22,989
No, of course not. I mean sugar kills you sugar's so like bad for you. You're taking in sugar

1720
03:34:24,729 --> 03:34:32,750
No, not me. You see not me not this guy not me and little do I know on my own that I was eating like

1721
03:34:33,229 --> 03:34:41,260
Pasta and like red meat and sauce and onions and fried chicken sandwiches three four times a week

1722
03:34:45,579 --> 03:34:47,579
No, no, I don't drink soda

1723
03:34:48,219 --> 03:34:50,219
Hey, german, would you like a soda?

1724
03:34:50,700 --> 03:34:51,659
Okay

03:34:53,479 --> 03:34:56,520
Here would you hear what he's saying? This guy's saying this would I like a soda?

1727
03:34:56,600 --> 03:34:58,559
Okay, are you disgusting?

1728
03:34:58,559 --> 03:35:03,040
You know that like that's like that you that like rots your teeth and stuff and it's like we're it's like smoking a cigarette every

1729
03:35:03,040 --> 03:35:08,159
Time you drink a soda. Okay, this guy wants a soda. No, i'll take a lemon with i'll take a water with lemon, please

1730
03:35:09,309 --> 03:35:13,790
Fucking idiot. Uh, what's your entree gonna be?

1731
03:35:14,700 --> 03:35:23,129
I'll have flour bread pasta and meat fried inside of the thing that has a bunch of fucking oil in it. Okay

1732
03:35:23,850 --> 03:35:33,879
Yum, are you disgusting? Yes. Look

1733
03:35:34,520 --> 03:35:42,559
That's all you need to see. All right. So this is milk dairy. Actually, you know what eggs probably no, this is dairy

1734
03:35:46,760 --> 03:35:48,760
There's your dairy. I got it

1735
03:35:49,639 --> 03:36:02,280
Okay. Yeah, I definitely eat more I ate more onions than dairy. Wait, I didn't put sugar up here. Did I write it?

1736
03:36:02,520 --> 03:36:19,850
You can't even see that but whatever it doesn't matter sugar you're making us sad

1737
03:36:20,409 --> 03:36:22,170
Why is this all your diets?

1738
03:36:22,170 --> 03:36:25,629
Is this what you guys used to eat?

1739
03:36:26,110 --> 03:36:28,010
Did you eat this now?

1740
03:36:28,010 --> 03:36:33,530
You were just like me. You're just like me until I found until I got on team turkey

1741
03:36:34,510 --> 03:36:39,370
and team nuts

1742
03:36:39,370 --> 03:36:40,989
Join me

1743
03:36:40,989 --> 03:36:45,149
Join the turkey eaters the nut eaters the peanut butter eaters

1744
03:36:45,629 --> 03:36:55,950
The the the tuna fish eaters the salmon eaters join us. Don't eat this stuff that often

1745
03:36:56,030 --> 03:37:00,590
It's not good for you. It's not as bad. All right after dairy we got

1746
03:37:02,270 --> 03:37:05,389
I did eat vegetables. I wasn't like a total fucking psycho

1747
03:37:06,909 --> 03:37:12,860
I did but I ate a lot of yogurt and I thought that was really healthy of me

1748
03:37:13,500 --> 03:37:16,200
I would eat one

1749
03:37:16,200 --> 03:37:26,540
Just unsweetened greek yogurt and thought I was a god for the rest of the day turkey shrinks your dick

1750
03:37:27,020 --> 03:37:38,590
Well, that would be weird. It does not oh my god

1751
03:37:40,799 --> 03:37:42,799
Turkey doesn't shrink your dick

1752
03:37:44,510 --> 03:37:50,270
That's absurd. That's insane. And I refuse to even acknowledge that that's a real opinion

1753
03:37:50,430 --> 03:37:52,430
So we're gonna move on we prove it. Look it up

1754
03:37:54,200 --> 03:37:58,520
Um, I don't want the last thing in my search history to be does turkey shrink your dick

1755
03:37:58,840 --> 03:38:04,729
I'm feeling i'll forget about that one and someone will use this computer and be like, okay

1756
03:38:05,049 --> 03:38:11,290
Something's going on with this dude. I did eat vegetables. I really did

1757
03:38:13,260 --> 03:38:17,760
I still was a big fan of green vegetables, even though this is like the end of the pyramid

1758
03:38:18,940 --> 03:38:27,799
No, you know, i'm gonna at least do myself a favor i'm gonna put this this belongs onions get that

1759
03:38:27,799 --> 03:38:36,750
I mean who eats just onions. I mean I did eat a lot of them, but still holy shit

1760
03:38:36,750 --> 03:38:38,750
It actually shrinks your dick

1761
03:38:39,530 --> 03:38:42,399
Shut the fuck up

1762
03:38:42,399 --> 03:38:44,719
I refuse i'm not gonna believe it

1763
03:38:46,989 --> 03:38:49,629
Turkey does not shrink your dick. I'm not even gonna look it up

1764
03:38:54,860 --> 03:38:57,360
The final thing would be like condiments

1765
03:38:57,979 --> 03:39:03,680
So we'll do this

1766
03:39:03,680 --> 03:39:05,360
Just look at this diet

1767
03:39:05,360 --> 03:39:07,360
You want to know the sad part about this diet?

1768
03:39:07,840 --> 03:39:14,239
So, okay screenshot screenshot this in a second because this is actually really bad

1769
03:39:14,799 --> 03:39:36,399
This is like oil oil and condiments. That's pretty much my diet what it was so essentially this

1770
03:39:38,200 --> 03:39:46,170
Leveled up and knocked out all these other ones and got down to here green vegetables like green greens greens greens greens greens

1771
03:39:47,399 --> 03:40:01,399
And like condiments this dude's a keto streamer. This dude's got a turkey dick

1772
03:40:08,879 --> 03:40:17,389
Okay, this is I don't think I can even say this but when you say that I imagine like

1773
03:40:18,430 --> 03:40:20,799
Okay

1774
03:40:20,799 --> 03:40:22,799
You know the turkey's neck

1775
03:40:22,879 --> 03:40:27,629
That's all i'm gonna that's all i'm not gonna say any more words

1776
03:40:28,350 --> 03:40:33,600
I didn't say any more words. I said do you guys know a turkey's neck?

1777
03:40:34,319 --> 03:40:39,680
It's like oh, I know what the turkey's neck is. Yes. I'm done talking. I'm not why do I need to continue to speak?

1778
03:40:44,360 --> 03:40:46,280
No neck

1779
03:40:46,280 --> 03:40:49,559
N e c k do you guys know a turkey's neck?

1780
03:40:50,280 --> 03:40:58,190
What about baby food? Yeah, but that was just like a little snack that goes like up here

1781
03:41:01,129 --> 03:41:05,610
Gizzard dick

1782
03:41:05,610 --> 03:41:07,610
All right. Yeah, that's right. That's me

1783
03:41:08,090 --> 03:41:16,090
Why did you say that? What do you mean? Why did I say that? Why did you type that?

1784
03:41:16,090 --> 03:41:19,690
Why did a thousand of you why did a thousand of you type that?

1785
03:41:20,569 --> 03:41:23,770
Is it bad that I said it or is it bad that over a thousand of you wrote it first?

1786
03:41:28,729 --> 03:41:39,149
All right. There you go. There's my food pyramids. I hope you enjoyed it, but here's the sad thing

1787
03:41:39,629 --> 03:41:46,639
I'm going to show you something because this is actually bad and it's I was thinking this as I was making this pyramid

1788
03:41:47,040 --> 03:41:53,450
Let's look at the actual food pyramid the one that everyone thought was the good one for like five decades

1789
03:41:57,159 --> 03:42:08,299
It is not that different to the one I just showed you food pyramid. Here it is. Okay healthy food pyramid

1790
03:42:08,620 --> 03:42:22,670
It's it's all bread

1791
03:42:22,670 --> 03:42:28,879
Okay, it's a bunch of bread and and vegetables and fruits and then milk. Let's see how different mine

1792
03:42:28,959 --> 03:42:30,959
This is so coolly made too. Look at this

1793
03:42:31,680 --> 03:42:33,760
Log in to see more. Oh my god

1794
03:42:34,399 --> 03:42:36,399
Don't give me that fucking bullshit

1795
03:42:37,799 --> 03:42:40,110
I can't even get away from this website

1796
03:42:40,110 --> 03:42:46,799
This is linked me to pinterest and i'm trapped on pinterest and begging me to make an account. Okay. Here we go

1797
03:42:52,329 --> 03:42:54,719
save image as

1798
03:42:54,719 --> 03:42:56,879
Here's the this is the original usda

1799
03:42:57,680 --> 03:43:11,239
image

1800
03:43:11,239 --> 03:43:13,790
usda

1801
03:43:13,790 --> 03:43:16,090
Okay, let's go over this real quick

1802
03:43:19,360 --> 03:43:20,959
This is what?

1803
03:43:20,959 --> 03:43:22,959
Your this is what you were supposed to eat

1804
03:43:23,840 --> 03:43:26,010
So you got bread

1805
03:43:26,010 --> 03:43:30,489
Bread cereal rice pasta should be at this was 40 percent of your entire diet

1806
03:43:33,959 --> 03:43:35,959
It was that was my diet

1807
03:43:37,959 --> 03:43:40,680
I didn't although I did vegetables were not up here and neither with fruits

1808
03:43:41,239 --> 03:43:44,799
This came down here

1809
03:43:44,799 --> 03:43:49,360
Milk yogurt cheese meat poultry. It was a bunch of bread and corn

1810
03:43:49,920 --> 03:43:59,180
This makes me want to puke. Is there no there's no turkey inside here, but I mean they do have peanut butter

1811
03:43:59,500 --> 03:44:01,020
I will give them that

1812
03:44:01,020 --> 03:44:06,700
Although this belongs here mayo is at the top

1813
03:44:24,329 --> 03:44:28,649
Mayo is apparently worse than cookies candy and chips

1814
03:44:29,610 --> 03:44:32,010
It's the worst thing in history of eating

1815
03:44:32,969 --> 03:44:34,969
You're not supposed to eat it

1816
03:44:35,739 --> 03:44:38,299
You're supposed to have mayo less than you have cookies

1817
03:44:39,200 --> 03:44:45,979
Now imagine if I ate like 30 cookies a day worse than sugar. That's not even accurate

1818
03:44:47,559 --> 03:44:49,719
Oil is good for you. This is old shit

1819
03:44:49,719 --> 03:44:53,959
This is back when they this is back when the cavemen were trading teeth with each other. All right

1820
03:44:53,959 --> 03:45:00,299
This is not even a real good list. This is the you want bread. You want to eat loads of bread every day

1821
03:45:02,989 --> 03:45:05,309
You want all of your food to come from bread?

1822
03:45:08,219 --> 03:45:14,379
Oh, yeah, this is pretty good diet 40% of donuts bread pasta and cereal and some tacos

1823
03:45:16,969 --> 03:45:19,610
They didn't know shit about mayonnaise. They didn't understand. They didn't know anything

1824
03:45:20,489 --> 03:45:23,530
They didn't know that had this fucking polyunsaturated fat in it

1825
03:45:24,670 --> 03:45:31,879
Yeah, that's a big word. I know it they didn't know anything about peanut butter

1826
03:45:31,879 --> 03:45:36,680
They're having all like the good fats fat was bad back in the day guys back then fat was bad

1827
03:45:36,760 --> 03:45:39,709
All fat was bad, but new science

1828
03:45:40,350 --> 03:45:49,790
Has put mayonnaise way back way down to here because it's a healthy fat. There's been so much more science on fat

1829
03:45:49,950 --> 03:45:53,729
That's why peanut butter everybody loves it. It's so good for you olive oil mayonnaise

1830
03:45:55,180 --> 03:45:57,420
Mayonnaise good real mayonnaise is healthy

1831
03:45:58,500 --> 03:46:08,430
Marshmallows marshmallow fluff is like zero. It's like 12 calories. They didn't know this shit back in the day

1832
03:46:08,829 --> 03:46:19,629
No, it's not it's not hold on is mayonnaise good for you real mayonnaise

1833
03:46:22,600 --> 03:46:25,979
Here we go, this is from very well fit

1834
03:46:26,540 --> 03:46:31,819
Dot com you think there's a website that doesn't tell you the what is good and fit for your fucking body

1835
03:46:32,059 --> 03:46:39,389
You don't think it's that website get out of here depending on the type of diet you follow mayo can be considered good

1836
03:46:39,950 --> 03:46:43,690
Or bad for you. Okay. Well, let me I gotta read the whole article

1837
03:46:43,690 --> 03:46:47,450
I'm actually gonna read the fucking reddit thread and make my opinion on it the reddit like height like the title

1838
03:46:47,690 --> 03:46:52,540
It's mainly hey

1839
03:46:52,540 --> 03:46:57,659
Americans seem to have a love-hate relationship with mayonnaise. It is the best-selling condiment in north america

1840
03:46:57,819 --> 03:46:58,920
Thank you

1841
03:46:58,920 --> 03:47:05,819
And it is a lot popular and it is in a lot of popular american foods from sandwiches. Thank you tuna salad

1842
03:47:05,899 --> 03:47:11,180
Love it deviled eggs egg salad. Oh tartar sauce. Love it part of my fish diet

1843
03:47:12,700 --> 03:47:15,520
But mayonnaise has seemed to have acquired a bad reputation

1844
03:47:16,079 --> 03:47:20,659
Hmm, maybe it's for much fucking internet dickheads that talk about how mayonnaise is fat instead

1845
03:47:20,739 --> 03:47:29,520
Oh, and I don't like it because it's like white and gross a high fat food mayonnaise is often thought to be unhealthy

1846
03:47:30,500 --> 03:47:33,139
It is mostly fat and as a result, it's calorie dense

1847
03:47:33,219 --> 03:47:35,940
In case you know, you gotta get put some weight on if you want

1848
03:47:36,430 --> 03:47:40,909
It's easy for calories and fat to quickly add up when you're not paying attention to portion sizes

1849
03:47:41,149 --> 03:47:46,610
Maybe you just shouldn't eat the whole can in addition

1850
03:47:46,610 --> 03:47:52,610
Some people steer clear of the popular condiment due to concerns that improperly stored mayonnaise would be hotbed for bacteria store it correctly

1851
03:47:52,770 --> 03:48:01,600
Thank you very well fit.com the safety of potato salad left outdoors during a fourth of july barbecue or a tuna salad sandwich from a food truck

1852
03:48:02,180 --> 03:48:12,899
May be questionable what that real is that actually a real thing?

1853
03:48:14,479 --> 03:48:18,639
The truth is with careful selection proper preparation and storage and moderate use

1854
03:48:19,040 --> 03:48:23,360
Mayonnaise can be a delicious and healthy addition to a low carb diet. Thank you

1855
03:48:23,680 --> 03:48:28,270
Let's see. Okay. Now let's get to let's get to the real meat here

1856
03:48:28,430 --> 03:48:35,360
Depending on the type of diet you follow mayo can be considered good or bad for you. Mayonnaise is mostly oil

1857
03:48:35,760 --> 03:48:39,920
So it is a high fat and calorie dense condiment with 100 calories per tablespoon

1858
03:48:40,000 --> 03:48:41,440
That's a lot

1859
03:48:41,440 --> 03:48:43,360
If you're on a low fat or low calorie diet

1860
03:48:43,360 --> 03:48:49,969
You want to exercise portion control and measure out the amount of mayo you use for people on a low carb or ketogenic diet mayonnaise

1861
03:48:49,969 --> 03:48:58,020
Can be endured more liberally while mayo is made almost entirely of fat. It mostly is unsaturated fat, which is a healthier fat

1862
03:48:58,180 --> 03:49:01,170
Okay

1863
03:49:01,170 --> 03:49:06,559
This is how this is how I determine how much mayonnaise i'm using so when I make tuna salad

1864
03:49:06,719 --> 03:49:12,190
It's one of my favorite things since even since I was a toddler since I was like seven years old

1865
03:49:12,430 --> 03:49:16,159
You take a nice good can of tuna fish a good one

1866
03:49:16,700 --> 03:49:25,569
Sustainable get a sustainable good sustainable tuna brand open it up. No, what do you mean?

1867
03:49:25,649 --> 03:49:29,440
No, put it in a bowl

1868
03:49:30,299 --> 03:49:37,860
Mush it up with your fork stir it around and then put a bunch of mayonnaise in there until it becomes a paste

1869
03:49:38,879 --> 03:49:49,069
Is that too much? I don't know. Is it too little? I don't know, but it becomes a like tuna paste

1870
03:49:50,270 --> 03:49:58,459
It's not thin. It's not like too much mayonnaise. It's just like enough to keep it all together. It was one time

1871
03:49:59,260 --> 03:50:04,459
Where okay, this is incoming disgusting statement. Hope you all know what we're talking about

1872
03:50:04,459 --> 03:50:06,860
Like how gross this pyramid is that we're looking at? All right. Anyways

1873
03:50:07,889 --> 03:50:09,889
One time I was really hungry

1874
03:50:10,450 --> 03:50:13,649
And I did a big thing of tuna right just right out of the can put it in there

1875
03:50:13,649 --> 03:50:18,579
Okay, i'm ready for the mayonnaise and I just I my my eyes went I saw red

1876
03:50:19,540 --> 03:50:23,889
I don't know why and I took a big tablespoon of the mayonnaise and I was like, all right, there's one

1877
03:50:24,129 --> 03:50:26,209
I'm gonna do another one. That's not enough

1878
03:50:26,209 --> 03:50:32,370
I did another full fucking huge tablespoon of mayonnaise and I started to stir it up and I went boom boom boom boom

1879
03:50:32,450 --> 03:50:38,620
Okay, and it's looking a little that looks fine. Not enough and I did a third gigantic disgusting

1880
03:50:38,940 --> 03:50:45,360
Slop of mayonnaise into it and there was probably more mayonnaise than tuna in this and I immediately regretted my mistake

1881
03:50:47,280 --> 03:50:51,549
I took a bite of it just just to check because I didn't want to waste it or anything and it was

1882
03:50:52,030 --> 03:51:03,950
It was I was and I ate it. I ate the whole thing. I ate the whole thing. He still ate it

1883
03:51:04,190 --> 03:51:09,020
That's not moderate no, but that that's all right though because listen why the oil matters is important

1884
03:51:09,180 --> 03:51:13,420
The good news is that almost all any edible oil can be used to make mayonnaise

1885
03:51:13,899 --> 03:51:16,620
But get all that other shit out of here. I want it with good

1886
03:51:17,239 --> 03:51:22,110
100 straight from italy olive oil. That's how I make mine

1887
03:51:22,270 --> 03:51:27,969
You can make your own mayonnaise cheaper the oil itself is the biggest factor in the healthfulness of the recipe

1888
03:51:30,639 --> 03:51:39,700
In the united states most commercial mayonnaise is made with soy oil. Yuck. That's problematic due to its high levels of omega-6

1889
03:51:39,780 --> 03:51:42,260
Get that out of here. No, you want the reels the good stuff

1890
03:51:42,500 --> 03:51:45,870
The best selling commercial mayonnaise in the u.s

1891
03:51:45,870 --> 03:51:49,979
Is helman's brand in the east and best foods in the west

1892
03:51:50,379 --> 03:51:53,659
Those companies sell mayo made from soy oil in the u.s

1893
03:51:54,139 --> 03:51:58,959
And canola oil in canada canola oil has a lower omega-6 content than soy oil

1894
03:51:59,729 --> 03:52:01,729
Nope, no, no, no

1895
03:52:02,049 --> 03:52:07,569
If you make the mayonnaise yourself, you can use any kind of oil including olive or avocado oil

1896
03:52:09,790 --> 03:52:15,739
Uh-huh. What did I just tell you you get a and plus this is I don't know how when this article is made

1897
03:52:18,139 --> 03:52:22,940
A lot of a lot of mayonnaise that you buy at like good stores at the grocery store have

1898
03:52:23,500 --> 03:52:26,540
olive oil

1899
03:52:26,540 --> 03:52:29,899
If I turn it in says soy oil, I turn it around immediately and I put it back

1900
03:52:30,659 --> 03:52:32,739
I put it immediately back on the shelf

1901
03:52:32,899 --> 03:52:37,120
But I don't need to do that anymore because I know exactly what I like in my brand

1902
03:52:37,360 --> 03:52:42,459
I either I either make it myself as i've never made mayonnaise of my own by myself ever

1903
03:52:43,139 --> 03:52:47,860
It's just a way to make the streamer make the audience think that he's way more talented and smarter than he is

1904
03:52:48,260 --> 03:52:50,739
When in reality it was all made up from the very beginning

1905

Holy shit, I think I would be unstoppable

1996
04:02:42,100 --> 04:02:48,610

And did you just talk you could be talking about mayonnaise for like an hour straight with like papers in your hand

2000
04:03:03,659 --> 04:03:05,659
You just shuffle them sometimes

2001
04:03:05,819 --> 04:03:09,819
And the thing about that mayonnaise is only soybean oil

2002
04:03:11,280 --> 04:03:16,639
Should be allowed in that mayonnaise. I'm just saying I think that's the most delicious kind

2003
04:03:17,600 --> 04:03:21,200
And my friend my friend from across the aisle my friend. They all call him my friend

04:08:55,569 --> 04:08:57,569
What does this have to do with the diet?

2057
04:08:58,110 --> 04:09:00,059
fletalalates

2058
04:09:00,059 --> 04:09:01,760
fletalalates

2059
04:09:01,760 --> 04:09:03,680
phytalates p h

2060
04:09:03,680 --> 04:09:06,399
t a l a t what it spell is

2061
04:09:07,340 --> 04:09:10,340
fletalates

2062
04:09:10,420 --> 04:09:14,530
fletalates

2063
04:09:14,530 --> 04:09:21,329
fletalates are chemical compounds used in a wide range of consumer products including pesticides paints and pvc plastic

2064
04:09:21,969 --> 04:09:25,329
Okay, the contribution of dietary intake of fletal site

2065
04:09:26,129 --> 04:09:31,520
Well, it's late. I was just I tried to say malice site from like warcraft

2066
04:09:32,000 --> 04:09:38,239
It was not well defined until a landmark study published last year in the journal of u.s national institute of environmental health sciences

2067
04:09:40,590 --> 04:09:43,790
Malice site has known to affect the genital development of lab rats

2068
04:09:43,870 --> 04:09:46,989
But human studies have also shown adverse effects on this on on that

2069
04:09:47,549 --> 04:09:55,649
The most important finding today to come from the study for future families a multi-center study for prenatal clinics in california minnesota and missouri

2070
04:09:56,139 --> 04:09:57,719
It was a simple study

2071
04:09:57,719 --> 04:10:04,299
researchers measure the levels of fletalates following flowing through the bodies of pregnant women and then later measure the sizing

2072
04:10:04,879 --> 04:10:06,879
characters of their

2073
04:10:06,959 --> 04:10:11,180
What did you do of their?

2074
04:10:15,100 --> 04:10:20,989
They measured the size and characteristics of their you did why?

2075
04:10:22,190 --> 04:10:24,379
You did what?

2076
04:10:24,379 --> 04:10:26,110
Why?

2077
04:10:26,110 --> 04:10:37,090
What the fuck you after they were born? This is that's unbelievable. Why would you do that?

2078
04:10:38,379 --> 04:10:47,309
Why would you do that?

2079
04:10:47,309 --> 04:10:50,270
That's I can't all right. I'm gonna that's unbelievable

2080
04:10:51,170 --> 04:10:54,690
So the kids were born and then okay. Goodbye

2081
04:10:55,170 --> 04:11:01,120
He's changed his social exposure to some of the same. There's okay

2082
04:11:03,899 --> 04:11:09,120
What what?

2083
04:11:09,120 --> 04:11:11,069
So, okay

2084
04:11:11,069 --> 04:11:19,659
They did a study not on adults. I don't

2085
04:11:23,790 --> 04:11:30,479
Pregnant women should avoid poultry to protect their son's normal development. Okay

2086
04:11:33,819 --> 04:11:36,899
Well, I know for a fact

2087
04:11:37,459 --> 04:11:39,059
that my mother

2088
04:11:39,059 --> 04:11:45,469
Ate chicken all the goddamn time all the fucking time all the time every almost every day

2089
04:11:47,620 --> 04:11:55,950
I turned out just fine. Thank you. It turned out just fine. I'm fine. Nothing wrong with me

2090
04:12:06,610 --> 04:12:09,420
Can I even play this game right now?

2091
04:12:09,420 --> 04:12:12,059
It's like one fucked up stupid ass study

2092
04:12:17,780 --> 04:12:20,020
guard dog

2093
04:12:20,180 --> 04:12:23,950
This dog hates me

2094
04:12:23,950 --> 04:12:27,600
The feeling's mutual it's because all the mayo cancelled it out

2095
04:12:28,559 --> 04:12:34,559
Oh, it's gonna be wonderful. He's been waiting so long for her to grow up. I wish I was married to him

2096
04:12:35,440 --> 04:12:41,360
That deal with a turtle dick made him he's a turkey dick. Well, oh this one's off the rails. It's gone

2097
04:12:42,559 --> 04:12:44,559
Are you jealous or envious?

2098
04:12:44,559 --> 04:12:46,079
Envious

2099
04:12:46,079 --> 04:12:51,579
Okay, we're getting the intel I need a key fuck. I should have listened

2100
04:12:56,290 --> 04:12:57,569
Hey

2101
04:12:57,569 --> 04:12:59,659
This person's a key

2102
04:12:59,659 --> 04:13:01,659
Quick before he comes back

2103
04:13:03,149 --> 04:13:08,750
Climbing a ladder in a dress. I double dare you kate. Here comes the runaway bride

2104
04:13:11,870 --> 04:13:13,309
All right, save here

2105

Crouch, she's gone

2106
04:13:16,860 --> 04:13:23,329
Do I get married up there? Why do I have to sneak? I object this union

2107
04:13:24,530 --> 04:13:27,010
Words fail me I am the bride

2108
04:13:28,059 --> 04:13:30,299
In certain missions kate can pickpocket enemies

2109
04:13:31,020 --> 04:13:32,459
Don't get spotted

2110
04:13:32,459 --> 04:13:40,260
Okay, let's get it. What do I do about this guy?

2111
04:13:40,819 --> 04:13:47,459
Here comes the run. I'm gonna knock this guy out. He's can I distract him a little touching up? Yes

2112
04:13:48,100 --> 04:13:50,100
Now aren't you? I'm crying

2113
04:13:51,860 --> 04:13:54,290

2114
04:13:57,860 --> 04:14:05,940
What's that don't mind me am I allowed to be here? Oh i'm allowed i'm actually allowed to be here

2115
04:14:06,579 --> 04:14:12,020
The guy on the balcony seems a little too fixated on her. Let's blind him a little with this perfume

2116
04:14:12,100 --> 04:14:16,659
I'm gonna spray him on the eyes in this wedding for years never could keep his eyes off of me

2117
04:14:17,379 --> 04:14:19,860
All right, i'm gonna spray him in the eyes. We have to be fast

2118
04:14:20,850 --> 04:14:22,850
Not like this. No

2119
04:14:22,850 --> 04:14:24,850
Bless your heart

2120
04:14:32,770 --> 04:14:35,459
I got the key

2121
04:14:36,979 --> 04:14:39,379
Now up the stairs and through the door to the library

2122
04:14:40,180 --> 04:14:44,399
What are you guys doing? Omega loli's blind. I just did it

2123
04:14:45,790 --> 04:14:56,940
I just did it

2124
04:14:56,940 --> 04:14:58,940
Not you the dude. Oh, okay

2125
04:15:01,969 --> 04:15:09,180
Let's go up here drop somewhere. There's the door slip inside when no one's watching strap in

2126
04:15:19,309 --> 04:15:24,510
Oh shit, he has turkey in his eyes. I can't wait to eat some turkey quick before he comes back

2127
04:15:26,299 --> 04:15:27,739
There's the door

04:15:27,739 --> 04:15:29,739

Knock out

2131
04:15:39,040 --> 04:15:44,639
Kate only knocks out guards and has no lethal takedown doesn't carry in a rope to tie them up. So be careful. They'll wake up again

2132
04:15:45,600 --> 04:15:47,600

04:17:19,809 --> 04:17:21,809

04:17:21,889 --> 04:17:26,239
Oh shit turkey

2149
04:17:26,399 --> 04:17:31,459
I left turkey

2150
04:17:31,459 --> 04:17:36,020
Yeah, you know i've been watching just in bed. I've been watching old commercials from like the 50s

2151
04:17:38,110 --> 04:17:40,430
Just hours of them just bored lying there in bed

2152
04:17:41,309 --> 04:17:45,780
Something that I I wish I could have and try and drink

2153
04:17:46,500 --> 04:17:50,100
Is coffee from 1950 it always looked so good

2154
04:17:50,659 --> 04:17:55,420
On these commercials. I don't know why it was always just a tiny little cup of just black coffee

2155
04:17:56,299 --> 04:17:58,459
I just want like 1940s coffee

2156
04:18:03,040 --> 04:18:05,200
Frank I see you found my office

2157
04:18:06,530 --> 04:18:10,530
You should keep your friends waiting hanging. Yeah. Well, sorry about that

2158
04:18:11,090 --> 04:18:15,250
The wedding you understand what are you watching that has commercials from the 50s?

2159
04:18:16,129 --> 04:18:17,790
I'm watching

2160
04:18:17,790 --> 04:18:19,790
1950s commercial compilations

2161
04:18:20,610 --> 04:18:22,129
That's the content

2162
04:18:22,129 --> 04:18:26,100
of course

2163
04:18:26,100 --> 04:18:28,100
Just give me a moment

2164
04:18:29,549 --> 04:18:34,510
Did I hear correctly that there was trouble in flagstone yesterday?

2165
04:18:36,129 --> 04:18:41,649
The usual doing drugs I can imagine. Mr. DeVitt isn't too happy about that. That's like a big snort

2166
04:18:42,530 --> 04:18:47,489
DeVitt isn't here. I wonder if he'd want you to leave things unfinished here

2167
04:18:48,899 --> 04:18:52,420
Or is there something more important in New Orleans?

2168
04:18:55,440 --> 04:18:58,000
Maybe you should just get back to your wedding eggins

2169
04:19:01,579 --> 04:19:08,620
Maybe you're right. They're under commercial compilations are underrated. Yeah. Well, she has every reason to be

2170
04:19:09,500 --> 04:19:10,700
pardon

2171
04:19:10,700 --> 04:19:17,010
Long time ago. He's just eat like king-size Reese's until I couldn't anymore while watching like old 90s commercials

2172
04:19:18,370 --> 04:19:24,850
Like 30 to 40 minutes each. I probably had like seven king-size Reese's bar to find out until after the wedding, right?

2173
04:19:27,739 --> 04:19:30,299
There's a lot not recently this is like at least five years ago

2174
04:19:42,379 --> 04:19:49,969
Wait a second, I need a drink

2175
04:19:56,180 --> 04:20:06,899
Hmm, can I just stay in here? Let me ride the horse, please the only thing I want

2176
04:20:11,329 --> 04:20:14,930
This ain't a discussion

2177
04:20:14,930 --> 04:20:16,930
So what's your plan?

2178
04:20:17,489 --> 04:20:20,129
Get in find frank do what I came for

2179
04:20:22,319 --> 04:20:24,430
This is not the same mission

2180
04:20:24,430 --> 04:20:30,420
March to the front gate. Yeah, there's a path down those cliffs

2181
04:20:32,299 --> 04:20:39,500
Bernie is a bernie voice. Just follow that and climb up those vines from there. I'll wing it. That's no plan

2182
04:20:39,819 --> 04:20:44,219
Amigo, I pulled all flimsier once I think something's up

2183
04:20:44,860 --> 04:20:49,659
I'll come and get you. No, you stay put and not really

2184
04:20:50,459 --> 04:20:52,459

2185
04:20:53,020 --> 04:20:55,020
Not even else not even close

2186
04:20:58,899 --> 04:21:01,860
Okay, where I need to go I need to go to enter the main lodge

2187
04:21:04,659 --> 04:21:17,420
Okay

2188
04:21:17,579 --> 04:21:21,659
I just want to try I thought maybe I could like speedrun just run through it somehow

2189
04:21:24,559 --> 04:21:36,659
Here we go. All right time to do the mission. Hello, sir. Everyone sounds tired

2190
04:21:38,370 --> 04:21:40,860
Um, no, i'm all right

2191
04:21:41,420 --> 04:21:52,770
This is what I have turkey on the brain, which means that i've seen my whole life. We're looking at you

2192
04:21:56,590 --> 04:21:58,180
Okay

2193
04:21:58,180 --> 04:22:01,739
I'm fine

2194
04:22:01,739 --> 04:22:03,920
I have full ammo

2195
04:22:07,920 --> 04:22:11,250
Look that way, please look

2196
04:22:11,729 --> 04:22:13,969
Heads or tails, let's get going

2197
04:22:14,530 --> 04:22:16,959
Who the fuck is

2198
04:22:26,799 --> 04:22:32,799
Turkey releases chemicals that make you tired. That's a myth. It's not real you're talking about tryptophan. That's not real

2199
04:22:35,790 --> 04:22:38,540
Tryptophan doesn't do anything

2200
04:22:41,500 --> 04:22:54,510
You think I ever have one of those okay, let's go hold this trick in the book

2201
04:23:02,319 --> 04:23:04,079
No

2202
04:23:04,079 --> 04:23:05,840
Why not?

2203
04:23:05,920 --> 04:23:11,579
Can't be that expensive how much is like, uh, okay, how much is a statue made out of a metal like that

2204
04:23:14,430 --> 04:23:21,059
It's now or never not gold not bronze. I'm sorry. What's like a cheap metal?

2205
04:23:23,040 --> 04:23:26,479
Okay, what if I had a statue of me made out of stainless steel? Why did this guy see me?

2206
04:23:29,659 --> 04:23:31,739
Make it out of stainless steel. We're just like

2207
04:23:32,459 --> 04:23:35,200
steel

2208
04:23:35,200 --> 04:23:43,889
500k I just need a few seconds. You hear that shall we stainless steel is not cheap

2209
04:23:43,969 --> 04:23:45,969
Yeah, but it's cheaper than bronze, isn't it?

2210
04:23:47,200 --> 04:23:49,200
I got lots of these

2211
04:23:50,450 --> 04:23:53,569
Oldest trick in the book throw it need some change

2212
04:23:54,209 --> 04:23:57,520
Not a problem

2213
04:23:57,520 --> 04:24:00,959
No, okay aluminum. Yeah. Okay. What if I had a statue made out of aluminum?

2214
04:24:01,520 --> 04:24:03,889
How much would it realistically cost?

2215
04:24:04,610 --> 04:24:06,129
what size

2216
04:24:06,129 --> 04:24:08,129
Uh like eight feet tall

2217
04:24:16,850 --> 04:24:18,850
If you are aluminum is expensive

2218
04:24:18,850 --> 04:24:21,340
All right, but what if we're talking about like aluminum can

2219
04:24:21,979 --> 04:24:24,930
a statue made out of the

2220
04:24:24,930 --> 04:24:27,819
Not crushed before it gets crushed

2221
04:24:27,819 --> 04:24:31,180
And I know dude somebody's gonna walk up to that statue made out of aluminum can

2222
04:24:31,739 --> 04:24:34,379
And it's just gonna go up to my face. They're not gonna damage anything else

2223
04:24:34,860 --> 04:24:41,819
They're gonna press and squish the fist into my face. So I have a permanent like deformed crushed in face

2224
04:24:42,299 --> 04:24:45,299
That's the only damage they're gonna do to it. So I look horrible

2232
04:25:28,770 --> 04:25:30,770
That would be on local news

04:25:40,610 --> 04:25:52,750

I I would never want a statue of myself

2241
04:26:27,659 --> 04:26:30,059
To me, I don't I don't think I would want that to happen to me

2242
04:26:36,370 --> 04:26:38,530
Unless I could if it could be a statue of me

2243
04:26:39,729 --> 04:26:43,010
On the toilet with a newspaper in my hand just looking at the newspaper

2244
04:26:43,489 --> 04:26:49,870
I don't want to be like pointing in the distance with a book in my other hand and like a big overcoat

Are you jealous off these chairs by the way? I'm convinced that there's never one of these is ever clean

2259
04:28:10,670 --> 04:28:12,670
I think they've been using the same ones for like a hundred years

2260
04:28:14,739 --> 04:28:21,809
These come brand new with a bunch of scuff barks and dirt and like footprints all over it. I hate these things

Ah, yeah, and you are kato hara pleasure to meet you. Yeah, was it hard? No, it wasn't

2626
05:09:39,380 --> 05:09:41,380
I don't know why I just thought

2627
05:09:41,380 --> 05:09:44,099
It says she didn't have any weapons and she didn't have any guns or anything

2628
05:09:44,180 --> 05:09:49,209
So I was like, oh she doesn't have weapons. Listen, I got someone that could help us. She can't use weapons

2629
05:09:49,290 --> 05:09:51,290
I was like, okay what thing is?

2630
05:09:52,009 --> 05:09:57,430

2634
05:10:09,060 --> 05:10:12,819
I'll see you guys tomorrow. Mr. Cooper. I'm actually really hungry to thank me

2635
05:10:13,540 --> 05:10:19,060
We have a deal don't we this frank must be a hell of a guy if you risk your life like this to find him

2636
05:10:19,779 --> 05:10:21,459

2637
05:10:21,459 --> 05:10:24,659
Well, you better hurry. We'll be ready for you at the ranch

2638
05:10:25,380 --> 05:10:27,380
We're gonna go. I want to see the end of this stuff here, though

2639
05:10:28,259 --> 05:10:32,169
I'll see you tomorrow

2640
05:10:32,169 --> 05:10:34,169
Why are we defending a ranch now?

2641
05:10:34,970 --> 05:10:38,659
Well, it's a long story. We're not gonna play desperados tomorrow. I'll explain on the way

2642
05:10:40,099 --> 05:10:42,819
Sure, i'm gonna give you guys a list of things to play

2643
05:10:43,939 --> 05:10:45,939
Tomorrow in pre-stream chat if you're there

2644
05:10:47,060 --> 05:10:49,459
Only about 30 to 40 minutes before stream I pop in

2645
05:10:50,569 --> 05:10:52,569
Sometimes a little more than that

2646
05:10:54,759 --> 05:10:56,759
Don't use disguise. How would you even do that?

2647
05:10:57,159 --> 05:10:59,159
Take a photo of the dead groom

2648
05:10:59,479 --> 05:11:02,330
Where did I get a camera?

2649
05:11:02,330 --> 05:11:05,049
Oh, you can bring him all the way out there

2650
05:11:06,950 --> 05:11:08,950
And lay him on the ground and take a picture

2651
05:11:09,430 --> 05:11:11,669
But you have to take him all the way to the beginning of the level

2652
05:11:14,389 --> 05:11:19,209
Uh, yeah, there'll be a poll tomorrow because I need to figure out what it's gonna be. It'll be probably three or four different games

2653
05:11:19,770 --> 05:11:22,630
I did that

2654
05:11:22,630 --> 05:11:28,680
Don't use the gatling gun kill everyone except for civilians. I didn't do that

2655
05:11:29,240 --> 05:11:32,869
Here we go

2656
05:11:32,869 --> 05:11:52,220
Brassatui?

2657
05:11:52,220 --> 05:11:56,889
Making a pretty good statue though

2658
05:11:57,209 --> 05:11:59,130
This is a big muscly guy

2659
05:11:59,130 --> 05:12:07,819
Come on, go down here and complete it. No, Jeremy. You messed it up. You idiot. You had an opportunity

2660
05:12:14,139 --> 05:12:16,889
Uh, no, not vr

2661
05:12:16,889 --> 05:12:35,450
Not vr

2662
05:12:35,529 --> 05:12:36,729
Sorry

2663
05:12:36,729 --> 05:12:42,200
What should I play though? It's gonna be either game cube

2664
05:12:42,919 --> 05:12:44,599
It might even be 3do

2665
05:12:44,599 --> 05:12:47,319
I might finally bust that thing out and actually play the damn thing

2666
05:12:47,959 --> 05:12:50,459
I have like 10 games for it, too

2667
05:12:55,220 --> 05:12:59,459
I only bought the 3do for one reason because I wanted to play this game. I'll tell you exactly what it is

2668
05:13:00,340 --> 05:13:21,319
Give you the exact name

2669
05:13:21,720 --> 05:13:25,939
It's called twisted

2670
05:13:26,279 --> 05:13:27,720
the game show

2671
05:13:27,720 --> 05:13:32,709
It's an fmv game show game

2672
05:13:34,099 --> 05:13:41,099
And it looks just it looks you know how they all look could be terrible. That's the only reason why I bought it

2673
05:13:51,580 --> 05:13:53,580
Not symmetrical. I'm annoyed

2674
05:13:53,979 --> 05:13:58,889
I always killed one person accidentally somehow zero bodies discovered though

2675
05:13:59,450 --> 05:14:04,700
How did cape kill oh right right because she went absolutely nuts

2676
05:14:05,900 --> 05:14:16,860
God I was gonna say that doesn't make any sense. She can't kill people a maid was a civilian. Oh, that's right. Yeah

2677
05:14:20,889 --> 05:14:23,029
This game is pretty good

2678
05:14:23,029 --> 05:14:24,709
How many levels are in the game?

2679
05:14:24,709 --> 05:14:27,459
Was it like three chapters four chapters?

2680
05:14:28,549 --> 05:14:31,750
One two, three, four five six twelve what 18 levels?

2681

2682
05:14:34,150 --> 05:14:37,849
Oh, I can see why people like it

2683
05:14:37,849 --> 05:14:42,090
If you if you're good at video games and you like planning stuff, you can do a lot of that stuff very very quickly

2684
05:14:42,630 --> 05:14:52,650
Simultaneously, but yeah, we're not gonna play tomorrow. We're gonna do either radio game cube

2685
05:14:53,689 --> 05:14:55,930
Or something else i'll give you pull tomorrow

2686
05:14:56,650 --> 05:14:59,400
Thanks for watching

2687
05:14:59,400 --> 05:15:03,740
Uh, sorry, we kind of the whole stream derailed for a full hour

2688
05:15:04,380 --> 05:15:08,520
We did the podcast episode where I talk about mayonnaise

2689
05:15:09,319 --> 05:15:12,220
Sorry about that

2690
05:15:12,220 --> 05:15:15,479

Say next time you go to the doctor regarding the mystery illness show them the food pyramid to see how wrong you are

2695
05:15:33,259 --> 05:15:35,020
It's not a bad diet

2696
05:15:35,020 --> 05:15:37,740
The mayonnaise I don't eat that much mayonnaise. It's like two rungs down

2697
05:15:39,779 --> 05:15:42,659
I'm a liar. I'm kidding. It's a i'm a i'm a funny guy

2701
05:15:58,119 --> 05:16:00,119

radishes daikon radish

2703
05:16:05,580 --> 05:16:08,060
That's like a almost a third of everything I eat
