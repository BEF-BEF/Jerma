1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:18,339
Hey everybody. How are you? Hi. Don't upset him. That's right. Don't upset me right now.

2
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:31,719
That's not one out of ten. You'll know when it's one out of ten. I'm giving myself a way to relax,

3
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:38,520
you know? I'm giving myself a cutoff, because if it gets, if it happens ten times, then I've,

4
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,439
I've got, I'm gonna, I'm going to leave. I'll see, I'll see you later. You know what I mean? Like,

5
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:48,600
you can't, you gotta, you gotta give yourself a, it's not healthy to get angry and then bring it

6
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,399
down like 50 times in one day. It's not good for you. It's not good for you. So we'll get a cabinet

7
00:00:53,399 --> 00:01:02,140
ten. I got a mold meter. That's right. Oh, by the way, I actually have to change that to two.

8
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,950
My coffee got fucked up this morning and I was, I was very upset by it. That's, and then I stubbed

9
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:18,140
my toe coming out of bed and I screamed into the pillow. So, I mean, so that's already two out of

10
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:29,140
ten. Anyways, I want to talk about some stuff before we go forward. I want to talk about last

11
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:34,620
night. I want to talk about the game and I want to talk about some stuff, because that was the

12
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:40,680
first time we even turned that server on. We got a lot to discuss. First thing to discuss is,

13
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,540
uh, well, hold on. Let me tweet this first so people know that I'm live and how they know.

14
00:01:47,500 --> 00:02:19,379
By the way, where's the, uh, oh, there it is. All right. Let me tweet this beer back. Okay. So last

15
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:25,780
night we did, uh, the Minecraft FTK experiment and it was very much an experiment because

16
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:32,099
none of the systems were in place last night. Uh, there was still some more development time.

17
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:35,620
Thing needed about like another, at least probably four or five days in the oven.

18
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,340
And we just said, you know what? Fuck it. Let's just open it up. Let's just essentially make this

19
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,699
stress test 2.0, uh, stream was an hour late and we just were like, let's fucking go and there's

20
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:49,699
no permadeath and no systems. Let's just see how many people join and let's just see if we can have

21
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:56,099
any fun. So, uh, it came out undercooked. Yeah, I did. And that was to be expected because we did

22
00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:04,520
a stress test the day before, but you, you can never, you can never have that exact experience

23
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,280
that you're looking for with like even like a stress test, because if I go in the discord

24
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,400
and I'm like, Hey, can we get like a few hundred people to connect to the server? And it's like,

25
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:19,560
all right, yeah, let's go. Uh, times that by like 50 is hard to get that, uh, to get that to work.

26
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,879
Time's upset today. I'm not upset. What are you talking about? I had fun last night.

27
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:30,360
I mean, it was, the whole thing was a shit show, but I think that was to be expected at some point,

28
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:38,120
but that was not what that game was going to be. So I have seen a lot of people look, I'm taking

29
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:43,000
the people have been writing about, uh, here's what I didn't like about it. Here's what I would

30
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,879
like changed. Yeah. What, what was up with this? What was up with that? I totally hear you. And

31
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:54,199
none of that last night was what the game was supposed to be. So we're going to put it back in

32
00:03:54,199 --> 00:04:01,699
the oven for like another week or two and try it again. But the data that was collected yesterday

33
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:11,240
was so important. There's no way we could have ever had any of the data we had last night.

34
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,280
Unless we had a shit show last night. You know what I mean? It's almost like you have to take

35
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:21,459
like an arrow to the arm before you're allowed to, you know what I'm saying? Like I sometimes,

36
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,899
no, you don't have to take an arrow to the arm. You could just dodge, but just know that the arrows

37
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:36,040
coming, you have to get an arrow shot at you first. Just dodge long story short. Yes. Uh,

38
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:43,639
there's going to be a more time is what we needed. Now let's move on over to jump king.

39
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:51,129
I still had fun last night and I know a lot of people did too. And I know there was some

40
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:58,860
dumb shit that happened last night and it was fun, but that was a glorified stress test too.

41
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,439
So don't worry. That was not the game. It's not like, oh, that was it. Okay. Well, that was

42
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:16,939
not what he described. Don't worry. Don't worry. Jump king. There is a smoking hot babe at the top.

43
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:29,430
Okay. So this is a game. Uh, this is a, what is other babes? Was that even here? I don't

44
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:36,060
remember that being here. It's a porn game. New game. All right. So I'll be playing this

45
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:47,990
with the controller or is that a bad idea? No, it's fine. Okay. You've heard the legend too.

46
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:58,149
So you're gonna get that babe, right? Go on then get up there.

47
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:15,689
All right. Is it just jump? You hold the button. Oh yeah. If you, it's like Luigi,

48
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:23,779
does down also do it? So it's just hold button. I get it. All right. So you, it's like,

49
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:31,269
it's like playing pool on it's like a pool video game. You have like a power and then a spot that

50
00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:43,180
you move the bar to. Yeah. It's like playing a video game pool. I get it. Yep. The red crown

51
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:54,120
wood. So this is the game because I can't move in the air. Whoa, boy. Okay. So how do I get these

52
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:06,089
ones then? And if I press right, I'm not upset. I'm fine. If I, if I press right, how much does

53
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:09,689
it go right? Does it go all the way? If I like hold and press right, it's okay. It's the whole

54
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:24,620
thing. It just launches you. You can't do a small left or a small right. Okay. This is going to be,

55
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:32,060
oh, this is going to be something. All right, let's go. So I have to go like this. No, like this

56
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:47,819
from here. There it is. This is like the first five seconds of the game. I'm not upset though.

57
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:58,250
You can tell I'm, I'm laughing. That means I'm not upset. Oh, for the love of not upset about

58
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:12,540
anything. I'm just fine. That's not one. Just not that hard. There we go. Okay. So is there

59
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:32,250
checkpoints in this game? She must really be something. No, there's definitely like little

60
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:48,009
safe spots like there are in getting over it. There has to be. It's that once you get it down,

61
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:58,200
you really get it down. All right. I'm thinking probably from back here. Yeah. Okay. Good. What

62
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:16,220
the hell am I looking at here? I have to hit what? Okay. So I've got to get in the middle.

63
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:37,740
Oh, shit. Okay. Now from here, I'm gonna hit my head on the ceiling though. All right. I'm

64
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:45,259
starting to get the hang of it. Don't go too far. Don't go too far. And then let's go.

65
00:09:46,220 --> 00:10:00,789
Uh, from here and then hold it down. Let go. All right. Don't hit your head. Good. All right.

66
00:10:00,789 --> 00:10:15,620
From here, I got to go. I got to take this very slow. I have to go slow. And then I'm thinking

67
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:22,950
on the left side here. Yeah. It's got to be like this. I might fall here, but it's attempt. It's

68
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:28,539
a good attempt. No, no, I'm not going to fall. What the fuck are you talking about? It's all right.

69
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:58,419
Oh, okay. Easy, easy. Don't get too confident. You're in the middle of the oak tree. Oops.

70
00:10:58,419 --> 00:11:06,100
All right. I had it. Fuck. I'm not mad. What was this one like this? Yep. All right. Easy,

71
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:21,940
easy, easy. That's not too, that's not dropping too far. It really isn't. Oh, okay. Slow down.

72
00:11:26,629 --> 00:11:31,429
I had the right idea though. That's the right idea. Just not as long.

73
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:44,950
Yeah. Oh, my man, slow down. My man, slow down. All right. I'll slow down. I'll slow down. I had

74
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:52,649
it. What am I doing? Okay. All right. All right. It's not even that bad. I, I really just fucked

75
00:11:52,649 --> 00:12:09,860
it up though. Bad. Faster. Don't tell me to go faster. That's not a good idea. Oh man. Okay. I

76
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:17,500
really do have to slow down. All right. That's fine. And then this is the long one. Don't you

77
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:35,850
dare. And then up here. Okay. Then like this. All right. How do I get through here? Reliably.

78
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:46,220
I have to like fall into it. I got it. I got it. What's this? How am I supposed to get up here?

79
00:12:46,860 --> 00:13:22,009
Do I have to bounce off the wall? I think I have to bounce off the wall. Just jump. I don't have

80
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:53,320
to go down from, hold on a second. From here? Is there any music in this game? The ledge on the

81
00:13:53,320 --> 00:14:15,159
left? Wait, what do you mean the ledge on the left? Wait, what? You mean like over here? What?

82
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:19,799
How am I supposed to get over there? That's not even a ledge. That's a, it's like two pixels.

83
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:38,019
Oh shit. Oh, all right. Good. Good. Just breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe.

84
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:43,460
You got to go from far away here. This is, look at how small that area that is. And I don't want

85
00:14:43,460 --> 00:15:02,250
to fall. Holy fuck. Okay. Uh, save it? There's no saving. Wrong one. Why is it here though?

86
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:14,019
I can't, I don't, I don't jump, I jump from here, right? If I do a huge jump from here,

87
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:33,179
will I make it to the bottom one? No, I don't think so. I don't like this. I don't like this.

88
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:40,169
Oh, I don't like this. I'm a Nancy Drew streamer guys. I don't like this,

89
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:46,070
but I'm, I kind of addicted to it. I'm not, that's me. That's not upset. I'm not upset.

90
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,830
I'm just stating that I don't like this. That's not me being upset about something.

91
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:55,929
Look, I can go to a restaurant and order food, take a bite out of the steak and go,

92
00:15:55,929 --> 00:16:01,450
I don't like this steak. I don't think I'm a meat person. I don't like meat. I'm not like,

93
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:07,610
fucking meat shithead. I hate you. Meat sucks. And like stabbing it with my knife. That's,

94
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:14,460
I'm not doing that. I'm just simply saying that I don't like meat. That's not me being upset at

95
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,500
the meat. That's been me just telling you, but I don't, I don't like to, I don't want it.

96
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:39,429
Vegan. Stop it. Oh God, no. This ain't even like the first five minutes of the game too.

97
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:57,850
All right. That was pretty clean. All right. That's clean. Clean. Clean. Oh no.

98
00:16:58,169 --> 00:17:13,849
Oh slob. Okay. How do I get over there? Some of you guys right now are sitting there going like,

99
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:30,650
oh my, he didn't even know. Just wait till he gets to the broken down helicopter. Oh fuck. Okay.

100
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:34,970
I've actually got mad there. I really did. I, that, that was, I'm, I am upset about that part.

101
00:17:35,769 --> 00:17:44,519
You can put one down. I have to change the stream title. This is going to be,

102
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:52,569
this VOD is going to be eight or nine different VODs. And there's going to be a number on each

103
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:56,250
one. So you're just going to be able to skip to your favorite chapter of angry, of angriness.

104
00:17:57,049 --> 00:18:17,740
That's one. I actually, that did piss me off. Scroll down the VOD listed seat. Oh, well it looks

105
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:25,019
like angry eight to angry nine was six minutes of two different VODs. Wow. That's interesting.

106
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:35,299
He really dialed it up there because from, from one to two, it was an hour.

107
00:18:36,019 --> 00:19:02,619
I wonder what happened here. I'm down to the beginning. I'm going to go down to the beginning.

108
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:22,869
Oh my God, man. I'm the, I'm, I'm even slowing down. I'm even slowing down too.

109
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:40,069
I was up there. I had it. I really did. I'm doing it way too long. What the hell am I doing?

110
00:19:48,170 --> 00:20:08,660
That's not upset. That's me asking a question. I'm just simply asking a question.

111
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:13,910
If you think it's hard now, you will not beat this game. I didn't be getting over it.

112
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:26,700
I got like 40% of the way through getting over it. And then I think I remember actually saying,

113
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:33,529
why am I playing this game? Like, what do you get from this? This is me. I'm not upset about

114
00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:36,970
anything. I'm just asking a question. What do you get? What do you gain from playing this game?

115
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:55,130
The taking up a smoking habit. I don't know. I don't get it. You get gamer points. Well,

116
00:20:55,130 --> 00:21:05,500
I don't need any more of those. All right. Here we go. I'm going to get out. I'm going to get

117
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:10,460
through this tree right now. I already have a gamer license. Yeah. I don't, I don't need a

118
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:15,779
different gamer license. I already have one. I already have mine. All right. Slow down.

119
00:21:16,339 --> 00:21:57,700
How I don't understand how that was wrong. Dude, come on. My webcam is the best part.

120
00:21:57,779 --> 00:22:05,099
I don't even have my webcast on. He can't jump omega law. Yes, I can. I just need to get,

121
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:18,710
I got to get used to the control system. This one is just, this one's fucking me every time.

122
00:22:19,349 --> 00:22:36,819
It's just fucking me up every time. You got to be so good with that one. He sucks. This game is

123
00:22:36,819 --> 00:22:57,880
fucking hard, man. Dude, the jump King is hot. What the hell are you talking about? All right.

124
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:03,960
What am I doing wrong here? I got it. I got it. All right. Everybody can relax. I got it.

125
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:39,420
You know, the worst thing about playing a game like this on stream is if I, if I was just alone

126
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:44,940
in my room and no one was watching, that doesn't bother me at all. Fall and death, whatever. That's

127
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,940
just going to happen. The whole, this whole game was designed for you to fall a thousand times.

128
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:55,259
Right. But when you, when you're in front of like a bunch of people, everyone knows you just fell.

129
00:23:55,259 --> 00:24:01,900
Even though even in my mind, whatever, who cares? This is a giant microscope being pointed down at

130
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:06,140
my house. There's a bunch of alien scientists looking through my window right now with a fucking

131
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:25,099
microscope. Damn it. It's because you're so small. No, you know what I mean though? It's like,

132
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:29,339
if you play a game like this, you're going to, you're going to, it's going to take you

133
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:33,819
50 hours to get up here. And it don't matter. You don't have any alien, you don't have aliens

134
00:24:33,819 --> 00:24:38,710
with telescopes looking through your window and then go and they go, Oh, did you shoot that one?

135
00:24:41,019 --> 00:25:19,160
It's just you and your Eggo waffles. Fuck. Okay. Fuck. How am I going to get over there? How do I

136
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:24,470
get to that one? How do I get to that one? How do I get to that one? How do I get to that one?

137
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:33,799
Oh my God. I got it. Um, now what? All the way over to the right. But is it all the way? I'm

138
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:41,460
going all the way, going all the way. I made it. I've made it. I did it. See right now, the aliens

139
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:55,859
are looking down. They're going like, I can't believe he did it. I'm the laser. There's no

140
00:25:55,859 --> 00:26:16,039
reason to watch earth entertainment anymore. He beat junking chapter one. Got it. Oh, I got,

141
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:22,940
this is a safe spot right here though. That's okay. That's fine. I'm, I'm, I'm glad I cannot

142
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:32,700
fall down this unless I really fuck this part up right here. All right. That fucking guy driving

143
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:40,019
the car, the guy in the fucking car that just sped by at a thousand miles per hour, it's just

144
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:56,200
screamed in my ear. What the fuck, man? Look, that's so annoying. That's so annoying. Whatever.

145
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,599
That's two. That's I, give me a break though. Seriously. I get to be mad at that.

146
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:07,740
I get to be upset about that. That's so annoying. And somebody just screaming outside your window

147
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:13,059
as loud as they can. Like somebody just threw a glass bottle at my house while I took that jump.

148
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:21,339
I'll get back up there. That was the alien laser.

149
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:29,660
We missed. Fuck. Don't make me laugh. Don't make me laugh.

150
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:34,980
Okay. Please get me up there. I just want to get past chapter one.

151
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:50,279
Oh no. No, no, no. The guy driving the fucking car, man. He's so easily distractable.

152
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:55,559
Oh, I'm so easily distractable. I'm so distractable. I get so upset.

153
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:59,960
It's like so easy to like turn me around. All right. I got to relax

154
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,259
because right now in my head, I can't stop it. I can't stop it.

155
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:13,940
There's a voice in my head that continues to say, fuck that guy. What's that guy's problem?

156
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:19,220
That guy's a dick. Isn't that guy a dick? Don't you hate that guy? That guy sucks. And I'm just like,

157
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:35,750
yeah, that guy sucks. I have to make a jump. Hold on. Hold on, Larry. Oh my God. Oh my God.

158
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:47,940
Oh my God. Okay. I'm back. This one actually is, this one's a challenge. Actually, it really is.

159
00:28:49,609 --> 00:28:54,019
Now if I just get, okay, relax. There's no cars now. There's no speeding.

160
00:28:55,859 --> 00:29:17,769
All right. Just make it over here. Got it. Done. Got it. Okay. We're good. Colossal drain. I got,

161
00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:23,289
oh yeah, but this channel points on the channel now. If you want to redeem them, I guess. I

162
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:25,849
haven't done anything to them. It's just whatever they have for default. So,

163
00:29:32,099 --> 00:29:36,809
okay. I definitely can't, that's going to, I can't stand on that. That's a tiny little,

164
00:29:37,769 --> 00:29:58,410
oh yeah. Really? How am I going to, oh shit. Okay. Do I, is this, is this, is this a jump up

165
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:18,230
scenario? It is. I need some trajectory here. All right. Oh, oh, oh, oh, all right. I haven't

166
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:32,680
made a mistake, a major mistake in a little bit. Yes, I did. Oh, that's, that sucks. That sucks.

167
00:30:32,680 --> 00:31:04,890
That sucks. I'm not upset about that, but that sucks. Okay. Stop. Okay. Good. Same deal. Oh no,

168
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:14,700
God. Oh no. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. That would have been three. That would have been three. It would

169
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:21,990
have been, that's not though. Okay. I'm going to, I don't know how long to hold for that one though.

170
00:31:25,529 --> 00:31:45,029
If you're not with you, it's the end too. I'm good. How are you? This game's addicting though.

171
00:31:45,029 --> 00:32:12,069
That's the one problem. Thankfully, this part's very easy. This one though, it's just,

172
00:32:12,789 --> 00:32:26,220
I can get this one every time, but this one, not every time. Don't you dare. All right. Let's go.

173
00:32:30,339 --> 00:32:50,279
Ah, got it. Ooh. It feels so good when you get it. You know what I mean? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Um,

174
00:32:53,019 --> 00:33:01,029
let me take a minute here. So I have to bounce off the wall. Or do I? Or should I just jump

175
00:33:01,029 --> 00:33:06,539
straight over? Is the, is the rain going to hit me? Is there obstacles in the game? Is there

176
00:33:07,259 --> 00:33:39,529
hazards? That's not a three at a time. It's not, it's not that bad. Okay. Now it's bad. Now it is.

177
00:33:39,529 --> 00:33:46,519
Now it will be. It will be in a minute. It will be here. It's going to be in a, oh my God. Oh my

178
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:52,920
God. I'm not mad. I'm not upset about it. Oh my God. I'm just surprised and very, very sad.

179
00:33:52,920 --> 00:34:11,829
I'm just surprised about what happened. Oh man. I'm just surprised. I went too far. I went way too

180
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:47,300
far. Oh, hold it in. Hold it in. Hold it in. Hold it in. Hold it in. Hold it in. Uh, hold it in. Uh,

181
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:54,860
yes has, is online gave 5,000, gave $50 right now. Good job getting past chapter one.

182
00:34:56,869 --> 00:35:05,239
Thanks. I'll take the congratulatory $50. Thanks with 5,000 bits. Uh, yes is online. Thank you.

183
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:16,699
Are there save points? No. That's not mad. That's laughing.

184
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:40,099
Okay. It's all being bottled up. Get off there. Don't make me mad. Okay. He's evolving. No,

185
00:35:40,099 --> 00:36:05,050
I'm good. Okay. We're good. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.

186
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:15,909
Okay. Crisis averted. Sorry. Sorry. I sat down. I sat down with thumb tech. Sorry about that.

187
00:36:16,869 --> 00:36:38,309
Why is this? Is this on my chair? This part just sucks. It just, I know. I know. He doesn't know.

188
00:36:39,909 --> 00:36:46,389
Broken out helicopter. I know. But for my, my current perspective in the current environment,

189
00:36:46,389 --> 00:37:04,809
I'm in right this second. This part is hard for me. Just jump because if you get this wrong,

190
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:25,260
even if it's easy, is this a shovel night guy? I'm just realizing this right now. Somebody just

191
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:41,769
used the channel points. What did you do? Don't you dare. That's exactly what I thought when I

192
00:37:41,769 --> 00:37:48,570
saw this. Somebody said, highlight my message, pee pee poo poo. That's a good use of channel

193
00:37:48,570 --> 00:38:03,829
points. I don't even know if they do. It's gotta be longer than that, but you get it's scary because

194
00:38:03,829 --> 00:38:16,900
don't you get, it's gotta be longer than that. I'm just so scared to do a jump there. Uh,

195
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:31,300
at the starfish. Thanks for five community subs. Appreciate it. Thank you. Get me over here. Come

196
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:41,480
on. All right. Come on. Come on. Now I'm good. I just have to figure out what they want, what,

197
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:46,039
what they, what they want me to do here. Adventure MF Dan, five community subs. Thank you, Dan.

198
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:59,880
Thanks a lot. Both of you. Is it, is it? Okay. All right. All right. Okay. Now these are going to

199
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:07,289
fall, aren't they? These are going to fall. I'm going to jump on them and they're going to fall

200
00:39:07,289 --> 00:39:17,380
down. No, they're not. Why did that, why did that go longer? Why did that go longer? Why did that

201
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:24,019
go longer? It's like, why did it go longer? Why did it go longer? What was that? Is that one

202
00:39:24,019 --> 00:39:29,059
different, these paste? I'm not mad. I'm asking a question. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not

203
00:39:29,059 --> 00:39:35,940
upset just asking questions. That's just, that's like, that's, I feel like about like a politics

204
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:47,530
show. No, no, no, no. I'm not, I'm not upset. I'm just, I'm simply asking a question. Like,

205
00:39:47,530 --> 00:40:03,110
no, you're very clearly very upset. We have more subs coming. Fitty gave some community subs.

206
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:22,489
Just farming channel points and emotes. Ignore, please. Well, thank you, Fitty. Friends are fun

207
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:37,059
when you hang out together and you don't get upset about anything. I almost blew that one.

208
00:40:37,699 --> 00:40:47,900
He's malding. I'm not. You'll know. You'll know. It's been very clear when there's been a two and

209
00:40:48,300 --> 00:41:08,150
there's been very clear when two and three have happened. So three, that's cheated. Oh, no, no,

210
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:12,230
no, there was no three. Yeah. Yeah. You got, you got, you guys are just like, you guys are gas

211
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:24,150
lighting. We didn't think that I had a third month, right? Witty username. Thanks to the five

212
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:32,409
communities. Oh, I like this game though. It's fun. Even though I, I'm not a big fan of steak,

213
00:41:32,969 --> 00:41:43,510
but if it's, if it's prepared, well, I'll, you know, I'll lead it. All right. My hands are,

214
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:52,659
wow. It's that spot up here that just killing me. Cause I can do this without a problem. Now

215
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:59,369
this area is not a big deal to me at all. As I'm very clearly showing, not making a single mistake

216
00:41:59,929 --> 00:42:11,210
getting up to that point. For instance, like here is fine over here is fine up to this one.

217
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:17,050
And then over here. So as you can tell, shit, I'm just, it's just this jump here. That's causing me

218
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:22,579
any problems at all. Why did it go to what happened there? What? Hold on. No, I couldn't

219
00:42:22,579 --> 00:42:28,780
put my hands down. What happened? Did my analog go the other way? Lots of community subs get the,

220
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:37,750
the acidic vengeance. Thanks for five community subs. Okay. Seriously. No, no, no, no, no. What,

221
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:44,739
what, what happened? What's going on? I don't understand. Okay. It's not, I'm being dead

222
00:42:44,739 --> 00:42:52,920
serious. Why does, what is going, why is that happening? I'm not crazy. I don't know why that,

223
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:58,070
why would I do that? Why would I do that? Why would I get all the way up there and just then do

224
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:06,250
that? Use the D pad. That's adding, uh, that's fucking it up for me. I can't use the pad now.

225
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:13,110
I'm too used to it. What did I, I don't, I just wish I knew what, what was going on.

226
00:43:13,829 --> 00:43:19,030
Mark, Marks, Marcus, Marcus, five community subs. That's another five community subs.

227
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:26,820
I just asked, I'm just asking a question. Don't you guys know that as long as you tell people,

228
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:31,780
you're not mad, you're not bad. It doesn't matter because you know who you, you know,

229
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:39,340
you know yourself. And even if your face is turning bright red, I'm not, I'm not upset about

230
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:49,750
this. You're only mad when you actually tell people you are. All right. Now what the fuck

231
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:58,389
is going on over here? All right. I got to use the D pad. It's, it's getting in my head now.

232
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:06,789
It's good. The D pad things get in my head too long. I know, but then it was too short.

233
00:44:06,789 --> 00:44:12,389
It was too long. Then it was too long. It was too long. Then it was too short. Then it was too long.

234
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:19,030
It was too short. Then it was too long. If you're going to do the impression, you have to raise

235
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:33,260
your voice in a couple of octaves. Nope. I can't do the D pad. Shit. I can't devolve right now.

236
00:44:34,059 --> 00:44:41,780
No, no, no. Okay. I can't, I can't just evolve. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. You know, it's,

237
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:47,340
it's happening and I haven't even been playing for like an hour. Um, the controls don't work.

238
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:52,150
I'm playing a dream and I'm going to dream right now. I'm pressing the buttons in the wrong order

239
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:56,329
and shit. Yup. You guys know what I'm talking about. You know, when you get like to a point

240
00:44:56,329 --> 00:44:59,769
where you're devolving and pressing buttons in the wrong order, I'm pressing buttons in the wrong

241
00:44:59,769 --> 00:45:05,260
fucking order and I'm, it's over. Somebody came over and shook me and I'm not even, I'm not even,

242
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:11,260
I'm not even actually like upset about anything. I'm just devolved. God damn it. I was fucking

243
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:16,619
devolved. Oh, all right. Add it. That's three. No, that, that counts. It does. No, fuck that.

244
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:24,949
That's I'm, I'm count it. That's fine. I actually am annoyed by the fact that, but I'm not, is it

245
00:45:24,949 --> 00:45:31,639
count? I'm not mad at game. Okay. I don't think I did. I, I, I, somebody came over and hit me

246
00:45:31,639 --> 00:45:36,840
in the head with a wrench. I can't, like the buttons, the controls of a foreign to me now,

247
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:55,179
like left, right. And then a, or like a, and then right. I, it's foreign to me. God, I know it's

248
00:45:55,179 --> 00:46:10,469
just three buttons, but when they, they, they bleed together. Relax. Cause like in my brain,

249
00:46:10,469 --> 00:46:15,989
it's like left and a, or a then left, or a then right. No, a then right. A left and a.

250
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:21,719
I'm doing moving and then jumping instead of jumping and then moving the analog. And I'm just

251
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:30,619
doing it backwards. I'm fine. Next up we have, oh, hold on. Let's like, I can't do this joke

252
00:46:30,619 --> 00:47:07,179
unless I have a face cam. So I can't do this yet. Maybe later. Cause I'm too focused. Why can't I

253
00:47:07,179 --> 00:47:21,800
do this one now? I was doing it. Okay. Stop it. Okay. I need to, no, don't. Whoa. Look at how

254
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:34,380
many fails. 62 fails. Where's my cam? Is it even plugged in? No. Hold on.

255
00:47:44,170 --> 00:48:07,929
All right. Let me, let me get this ready.

256
00:48:24,949 --> 00:48:50,809
This is my break time. This is a show. What are you talking about?

257
00:48:56,860 --> 00:49:02,619
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome back to around politics where we talk about politics.

258
00:49:02,619 --> 00:49:08,139
We go over all the things in politics. Joining me now via satellite who claims he's absolutely

259
00:49:08,139 --> 00:49:12,789
not angry at all. Fire satellite from Las Vegas, Nevada. We're going to get the state of his

260
00:49:12,789 --> 00:49:32,409
political party. German nine eight five. Are you with us? Yeah. Yeah, mom. What are the questions?

261
00:49:32,409 --> 00:49:57,260
Just, uh, just have a few of those myself. Why is your face so red? We don't know. I didn't tell you.

262
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:00,380
I was angry. I just kept, I was just coming on the show to answer a few questions to give you

263
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:36,619
some of my own. He's so livid. Mega milk. What's that? Stop. Stop. Oh yeah. Ladies and gentlemen,

264
00:50:36,619 --> 00:50:39,659
ladies and gentlemen, hold on a minute here. I'm getting, I'm getting word.

265
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:53,579
Oh, what's that? Uh, this just did. Ladies and gentlemen, if, if you are wearing a white shirt

266
00:50:53,579 --> 00:51:00,840
with blue sleeves on it, just getting the word right now, then you have to absolutely be

267
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:04,840
referencing. What am I getting on my desk here? You absolutely have to be referencing some fucking

268
00:51:04,840 --> 00:52:00,329
weird anime shit apparently. Yes. Anytime you wear a blue sleeved t-shirt. What? I don't know. All

269
00:52:00,329 --> 00:52:13,210
right. Let me at least get through chapter two. We're just having fun today. Where am I? Where am

270
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:16,570
I? Where am I? Where's my character? What happened? How did I get over here? Is this a secret?

271
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:34,630
Where? What happened? Yes. What do I do about this? Can I get anywhere from here? I think I have to

272
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:50,869
go back up. Go down. Oh, what? I didn't know there were illusory walls in the game. What?

273
00:52:51,989 --> 00:52:58,139
Okay. Now that I know that, that doesn't really help me though. This just kind of makes it,

274
00:52:58,139 --> 00:53:15,269
this makes it harder. Why would I do that? That makes it harder. I just like burped and acid went

275
00:53:15,269 --> 00:53:26,460
up into my throat. Is that me being mad? That's my body being mad, right? Or I think that's my

276
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:33,880
hernia. I think that's just a symptom of a hiatal hernia. Yeah, I think so. Okay. So no, then no,

277
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:47,510
that doesn't matter. Five? All right. I was up there so much. I just got to get back to what I

278
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:57,019
was doing. Just back to where I was. Holy shit. I almost just blew that. No, no, no, don't go

279
00:53:57,019 --> 00:54:06,969
straight down. Oh, man. I had it too. I'm sitting at the roulette table and I put a thousand dollars

280
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:16,389
on like red 21 and it landed in the space next to it. So I was like, that's like, that's,

281
00:54:16,389 --> 00:54:21,269
that's $35,000. I had it. I mean, it was right there. I thought, you know, it'll happen again.

282
00:54:21,269 --> 00:54:45,860
If I do it again, slow it down. Take a minute. That's Vegas humor. Stop. Why did I even read

283
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:49,380
chat? What was the point of reading chat? Why did I look over? Why would I look over there?

284
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:52,980
What would I look over at chat for, for that reason? At that moment? Why would I do that?

285
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:58,920
There's no, there's no reason for me to look over the chat room when I'm in the middle of holding

286
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:09,590
down a jump. Like I'm just asking to lose. There's no reason to do what I just did.

287
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:44,469
I'm not mad about this. I'm just stating a fact. Okay. Mad.

288
00:55:44,710 --> 00:56:08,179
Hmm. Quiet. Quiet. Good. Good. Good. Now get over it. All right. Took me long enough. No,

289
00:56:08,179 --> 00:56:12,179
just not that. It's something about, there's a bug in the game. There's a bug in the game.

290
00:56:12,179 --> 00:56:14,099
There has to be a bug in the game. There's a bug in the game. There's a bug in the game.

291
00:56:14,099 --> 00:56:16,260
There's a bug in the game. There's a bug in the game. That spot right there. There's a bug in

292
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:19,300
the game. That's the third time that's happened. It's the only time it's happened the entire time

293
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:24,340
I played the entire game for an hour. That's the only time that's happened. It's only in that spot.

294
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:27,300
Why is it only in that spot? Makes no sense. That's the only time that's happened.

295
00:56:29,269 --> 00:56:31,989
Like I'm trying to get that to happen right now. And it won't.

296
00:56:32,949 --> 00:56:40,019
You understand? Why? Why is that the only spot where that happens?

297
00:56:40,019 --> 00:57:14,570
There's a bug in the game. Five. Maybe. I'll put it to the judges. We'll see. Get out of here.

298
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:16,010
Is this a British bake-off?

299
00:57:16,889 --> 00:57:24,940
I just need to determine if he was actually angry or not.

300
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:50,650
Now what? What's up here? I did it. I made like this shop. Okay, there's a shop right here.

301
00:57:50,650 --> 00:58:16,119
Now what? I did it. I'm so scared to do this. Oh, look at this next part. Look at this next part.

302
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:32,630
Foss King's Keep. This doesn't look that bad. You're right. It really doesn't. As long as I

303
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:59,340
slow down. I mean, that's I think that's what I have to do. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.

304
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:02,059
It's not that bad. It's not. Get the bird. Get the bird. No, I don't care about the bird.

305
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:07,719
Why would I get the bird for? I'm not getting the bird. You want to go get the bird.

306
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:22,650
Why would I do that? Just to get the good ending. All right. The judges have determined that I was

307
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:36,460
actually upset. Oops. I didn't mean. Okay. I meant to change it to 20.

308
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:47,380
I'm sorry. I meant to change it to 20. Yeah, I guess I leveled up. I guess I got more. I leveled up.

309
00:59:49,000 --> 01:00:12,199
Every time I go another floor. I get another 10. I leveled up. No, stop. Okay, just just do what I

310
01:00:12,199 --> 01:00:28,260
was doing. Every time you fall down, you lose. No, that's not how it works. You don't get to take

311
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:38,760
you don't take levels away. You just gain levels. You don't d level in any video games. In what

312
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:48,039
video game do you d level for doing poorly? No, you just get stronger. How's that wrong? You d

313
01:00:48,039 --> 01:01:13,420
level. Okay. Don't be stupid. These little jumps make me want to go to the dentist and have them

314
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:32,570
just drill without novocaine. Am I mad? No, no. Okay. No, you're just a psycho. Yeah. Okay. That

315
01:01:32,570 --> 01:02:32,679
doesn't mean I'm mad. How am I going to get up here? I have. Wait, what? I see. I know. I know

316
01:02:32,679 --> 01:02:39,690
all you guys are secretly rooting against me. That's the thing. You know what I mean? I know it.

317
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:44,730
I know. It's like I'm the bad guy. I'm the I'm the guy that comes out during the wrestling event

318
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:52,570
that knows he's going to get booed when he comes out. I'm the heel of the stream. You want to see

319
01:02:52,570 --> 01:03:17,059
me fall. You want to see me fall down. So these little jumps that make me giggle. Okay, stop.

320
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:24,809
Stop. Stop. I will actually fuck this all up. That's not mad. You guys have been around this

321
01:03:24,809 --> 01:03:33,320
channel for long enough to know what that actually means. Right? You guys are just waiting for someone

322
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:37,980
to open the door and hit me in the back of the head with a fucking chair. You know how many

323
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:41,900
pog champs would happen if somebody just give guy in a speedo came in the back door here

324
01:03:42,460 --> 01:04:27,079
and just smashed me in the back of the head with a fucking folding chair. I oh my don't do it.

325
01:04:27,639 --> 01:04:47,989
I'm gonna try uh see if I can get to the next level.

326
01:04:50,860 --> 01:05:14,949
I fell. Why is the audio so bad? When was this video uploaded? Or this video was

327
01:05:14,949 --> 01:05:18,309
uploaded like two years ago. Why does it sound like a cell phone video?

328
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:38,309
There are a lot. Like can I just say there are at least like three or four very large viewed

329
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:57,909
WWE best chair shots. This is happening to me.

330
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:34,869
I was reacting. Oh dude. Oh what the oh holy shit those are brutal. That wasn't

331
01:06:34,869 --> 01:06:47,030
bad. I was reacting to the video. You know you do something enough times that you probably have to

332
01:06:47,030 --> 01:06:53,590
figure out that it's not what you're supposed to do. I think I've hit that moment right now.

333
01:07:02,219 --> 01:07:11,960
No you don't go that way. Is it mad if I tell that person to shut up

334
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:24,019
for spamming another streamer's stream in here? No that would just be me. That's not mad.

335
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:36,599
Okay slow down. Now I gotta go from here to there and then damn how am I gonna get from here?

336
01:07:36,599 --> 01:07:42,420
Oh that's such that's that's very very very difficult. That's very very very difficult.

337
01:07:43,059 --> 01:08:32,659
I got babies. Oh this is hard. How do I get this one? Oh that was close. That was very close.

338
01:08:36,489 --> 01:08:42,819
Oh man that was close. Why did I hold it for that long? Okay slow down. Get the get the get the bird.

339
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:55,689
Okay fine. No no don't I'm not getting the bird. I don't care. Don't don't don't don't get bird.

340
01:08:55,689 --> 01:08:59,960
All right I'm not gonna get the bird. I'm not I don't even have the confidence to get the bird.

341
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:13,739
I don't even have confidence to go up this way. I'll have confidence. I will. There'll be that

342
01:09:13,739 --> 01:09:45,180
moment where I play you say run. You guys know what I'm talking about. I also would rather fall

343
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:47,979
down the whole thing and have to go up because I'm just seeing this on repeat and it's killing me.

344
01:09:48,699 --> 01:10:15,909
God get. All right one two three go. No no no no no no that one is too hard.

345
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:21,079
I'm gonna make a steam review and it's gonna say I like the game a lot.

346
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:31,829
It's very fun but some of the jumps just feel like they're unfair and I would know

347
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:38,979
because I have I'm gonna write seven paragraphs about this game and all the things that I don't

348
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:56,970
like about it now it's stupid now I don't like it with 0.2 hours in game. I'm gonna have a

349
01:10:56,970 --> 01:11:01,210
full steam review about all the things I didn't like about it and I may have not even gotten

350
01:11:01,210 --> 01:11:17,909
past the menu screen. I gotta try this. No what a mistake. It's fine. Oh it's just I don't know

351
01:11:17,909 --> 01:11:22,229
what it is about this. I don't know what it is about this one. I just I'm stuck here. I'm stuck.

352
01:11:23,109 --> 01:11:28,970
I'm just stuck in this one. Thank god I can't fall. I said I would rather fall but no I don't.

353
01:11:29,050 --> 01:11:32,250
Imagine if I had to come up here and do this all over again just to get to the top to miss that

354
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:48,010
jump like five times. No no no I don't want to do that. Okay now what do I do? Should I jump up

355
01:11:48,010 --> 01:11:59,350
to the right? Don't click link. What's what do you mean don't click link? I have to go left do I? No

356
01:11:59,350 --> 01:12:05,399
I don't. I'm not clicking the link. I'm not clicking the link. Are you guys about to get like

357
01:12:05,399 --> 01:12:13,479
banned? Why did I jump this way? I have to jump this way. No I don't. What about what's going on?

358
01:12:14,119 --> 01:12:39,210
Do I? Oh no. Click the link. All right get that fucking link out of here.

Get that link out of here. Get that link out of here. Get that. Get the link out. Get that.

360
01:12:50,869 --> 01:12:58,899

364
01:13:36,359 --> 01:13:42,710

365
01:13:43,430 --> 01:13:45,590
Oh my god I had it. I had it. I had it.

366
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:01,859
No. No. Ladies and gentlemen. Fire satellite. Let's see how he's doing.

367
01:14:02,579 --> 01:14:21,220
To discuss all politics. Larry Stevenson. I'm okay. I'm not red. I might have been red for a

368
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:36,859
little bit. I'm all the way down here now though. Okay. It's not that bad.

369
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:55,510
Milk thing. You want me to get the chairs? All right guys so I so I guess so I guess the Toronto

370
01:14:55,510 --> 01:15:00,810
Blue Jays need a new uniform. Which Toronto Blue Jays have to have all new uniforms now because

371
01:15:00,810 --> 01:15:31,369
they're the milk team. That now that counts. That does. Yeah. That counts as two. Toronto.

372
01:15:31,369 --> 01:15:36,170
I don't even want to say this out loud but how fucking stupid would that be if they were the

373
01:15:36,170 --> 01:15:46,090
Toronto Mad Mecham. That would be so stupid. Wow. Oh that hurt my back.

374
01:15:47,850 --> 01:15:56,739
The Toronto. Imagine having to fucking say that as an announcer. How embarrassing.

375
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:02,500
I can't say it out loud. I refuse to say it out loud. I don't even know what it is.

376
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:06,659
I don't even know what it is. Why would I just talk about something I don't know anything about?

377
01:16:12,069 --> 01:16:19,989
Fuck. Okay I need to relax. Here's your Toronto. Your Toronto.

378
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:35,260
Everybody just screams. Cheers. All right stop. I have to do this right.

379
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:41,640
Why does everything have to be funny? You know what I mean? Everything is funny.

380
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:47,529
Why does everything have to be so funny? Turma why do you laugh so much? I don't know because

381
01:16:47,529 --> 01:17:08,579
everything's funny. What am I supposed to do? Thank you Bible Black for the five community subs.

382
01:17:08,579 --> 01:17:19,579
Thank you Bible. Appreciate it. That's apparently the funniest thing I've ever seen.

383
01:17:20,380 --> 01:17:35,399
What? Why is that so funny? Whatever. Google it. No. Thanks for the subs though. Appreciate it.

384
01:17:46,199 --> 01:17:46,699
No.

385
01:18:00,149 --> 01:18:14,729
Okay I'm gonna lose my mind. You guys are an absolute menace. I didn't say it either. All right

386
01:18:14,729 --> 01:18:19,770
I keep having trouble with this shit. This one that jump right there is one of the hardest. I've

387
01:18:19,770 --> 01:18:33,380
read the Steam review. I remember them saying that part right there is the worst. Nondescript

388
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:39,000
civilian. Thanks for the 10 community subs. 10. Just dropped right now. Thank you so much.

389
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:51,380
Appreciate it. 50 subs? What are you talking about? When? Dude Pog. What? He said that. Oh I don't

390
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:56,439
know. How am I supposed to differentiate between what you guys have for like porn usernames? I

391
01:18:56,439 --> 01:19:04,090
don't know. Am I supposed to know the title of every porn ever invented? How am I supposed to

392

03:30:45,190 --> 03:30:46,149
no no other way around

865
03:30:54,979 --> 03:31:12,340

908
03:39:29,190 --> 03:39:45,510
one too and i'm like not even making progress anymore all because of the dumbass coin that

909
03:39:45,510 --> 03:39:53,670
doesn't fucking do anything it just is there it's only there for you to blow your run that's the

910
03:39:53,670 --> 03:39:58,549
only reason why it exists and i know it's gonna be some like oh you really wanted that coin well

911
03:39:58,549 --> 03:40:03,350
chasing the coin is it was the detriment the whole time you didn't even need the coin you don't even

912
03:40:03,350 --> 03:40:09,430
need those boots the coin it was the fucking variable that you don't need the boots to win

913
03:40:13,190 --> 03:41:10,780
you had it in you the whole time i can't find it never mind is he smoking crack nope

914
03:41:10,780 --> 03:41:28,540
you know how did we get here how did we get here i was up all the way how did i get here

915
03:41:32,420 --> 03:41:40,940
how did we get here you're supposed to go up you're absolutely shit at this game go play nancy

916
03:41:40,940 --> 03:41:46,219
drew it's your pace apparently everyone's shit at this game because only four percent of people

917
03:41:46,219 --> 03:41:53,260
have completed it so by that logic if there's 6,500 people right now only four percent of you guys

918
03:41:53,260 --> 03:42:14,379
are any good at this what's that number what's that number what like fucking 60 of you look at

921
03:42:47,690 --> 03:42:57,270

970
03:58:52,950 --> 03:59:44,459

971
03:59:45,340 --> 03:59:56,120

972
03:59:56,920 --> 04:00:05,700
all right yeah i want to beat them i want to beat the people that that completed this game

973
04:00:05,700 --> 04:00:12,840
like on completion i wonder how fucking red their eyes were and if their back hurt

974
04:00:13,479 --> 04:00:47,100
hey that didn't make it up it consumed them oh god zoom in on that one because that's the worst

975
04:00:47,100 --> 04:00:53,420
jump in the whole game so far absolutely without a doubt that is the worst jump in the entire

976
04:00:53,420 --> 04:01:13,100
fucking game without a thousand doubts like without a single doubt in my mind i don't even have to i

977
04:01:13,100 --> 04:01:17,739
think about that for a second hey what was like the dumbest jump in the whole game oh uh probably

978
04:01:17,739 --> 04:01:21,899
the one where you have to basketball yourself down a hole and it has to be exact or you fall

979
04:01:21,899 --> 04:01:52,219
down the whole thing he doesn't know about the broken down helicopter like the margin for human

980
04:01:52,219 --> 04:01:57,180
error we just don't give a shit about any of that what do robots have to play these games

981
04:01:58,969 --> 04:02:39,700
fucking jump king somebody else is doing it for me no they're not oh my god how did i keep that

982
04:02:39,700 --> 04:02:47,299
enough down here because they have these they have like three jumps that are so fucking finicky that

983
04:02:47,299 --> 04:02:54,180
if you like why are these not like that why is this jump right here not why is this jump right

984
04:02:54,180 --> 04:03:12,250
here not like that i don't understand it's fucking ridiculous and it sucks because i know it's

985
04:03:12,250 --> 04:03:19,399
intentional like there's a person right now standing in front of me and i'm not i'm not

986
04:03:19,399 --> 04:03:26,540
supposed to get mad at this person right but this person is going in my face la la la la la la la la

987
04:03:26,540 --> 04:03:32,299
hey hey la la la la la and i'm he's doing a look at what should i do you have to be like

988
04:03:32,299 --> 04:03:43,819
get the fuck away from me like that's what that's what this game is doing it's just like hey hey

989
04:03:43,819 --> 04:03:48,299
hey like right in my face it's like dude get the fuck out of here no it's intentional therefore

990
04:03:50,920 --> 04:04:44,020
see i got you i wouldn't say sorry i got you did he make it yet no not even close it's just so

991
04:04:44,979 --> 04:04:48,899
uh like humans humans are so imperfect you know what i mean

992
04:04:50,500 --> 04:04:58,700
this game goes against everything we know as humans humans are imperfect we can't do perfect

993
04:04:58,700 --> 04:05:21,020
fucking things we're not capable of that you can't the speedrun is five minutes and that person

994
04:05:21,020 --> 04:05:40,020
probably spent hundreds and hundreds of hours playing this those are some red ass eyes it was

995
04:05:40,020 --> 04:06:20,899
five minutes don't make me laugh i'm trying to get out of here by the way this guy wouldn't

996
04:06:20,899 --> 04:07:01,700
last in the fucking mcu i got news for you he would do this and then get liquidated that was

997
04:07:01,700 --> 04:07:07,319
just so long ago all right can we agree that if i'm not gonna i'm not gonna get the coin

998
04:07:07,319 --> 04:07:35,139
i don't care no coin i don't this is a coinless run what was wrong with that what was wrong with

999
04:07:35,139 --> 04:07:54,170
that who just gave money lots of money uh pigums gave ten thousand bits thank you pigums

1000

percent perfect every fucking single time you can't there's no margin zero zero you do it

1008
04:09:11,690 --> 04:09:23,299
perfect every time or delete the game turn your facecam on no you don't want to see me right now

1011
04:10:34,780 --> 04:11:00,379
you look you fell 50 000 times now i can't get that one it's just

1012
04:11:01,899 --> 04:11:10,219
oh my fucking god you can't be kidding me man no fucking way this is unbearable

1013
04:11:10,860 --> 04:11:24,229
unfucking bearable unbearable it's unbearable i can't bear it any longer

1014
04:11:24,229 --> 04:11:51,190
but i'll continue to do so he's too impatient it's hard to stay patient when you've fallen down the

1015
04:11:51,190 --> 04:12:02,309
same ledge 500 times just just stay patient and come on just relax you've been hitting your head

1016
04:12:02,309 --> 04:12:10,489
against a wall for three hours hey just sit down just do it you're cool you got it i've been hitting

1017
04:12:10,489 --> 04:12:39,239
the head with a chair like five times germ is going to be great one day oh i know one day that's

1018
04:12:39,239 --> 04:12:44,280
another thing when if you're really patient you lose your flow and then you fuck it all up

1019
04:12:46,379 --> 04:13:14,649
you all know this don't suck well explain that to the other 96 percent of every human that's

downloaded this game we should we should we should get them in a call let's call up let's call up the

1021
04:13:24,709 --> 04:13:29,670
96 percent of every living person that has downloaded jump king and let's let's ask them

1022
04:13:29,670 --> 04:13:57,899

1023
04:13:57,899 --> 04:14:03,000

04:15:09,180 --> 04:15:40,860
look at me stuck here he's so mad what should i not be what should i do

1028
04:15:47,610 --> 04:15:58,540
it's that same stupid ass job they always put one one one jump that's just you gotta get it

1029
04:15:58,540 --> 04:16:18,340
perfect or you're falling all the fucking way down did the people talking about sakiro easy mode open

1030
04:16:18,340 --> 04:16:46,549
this game i feel like they'd have a heart attack do they know this one exists i feel like they would

1031
04:16:46,549 --> 04:17:15,100
turn like green when they if they played this okay can we get this back on track we can get this back

1032
04:17:15,100 --> 04:17:19,399
on track this game is designed to make you mad oh yeah i know that's why i'm not done playing it

1033
04:17:24,600 --> 04:17:32,520
i know oh i know that doesn't mean i'm i'm not slightly a little bit irritated i only caught

1034
04:17:32,520 --> 04:17:39,819
the last half of the incident but during seriously went off the rail what you're a masochist

1035
04:17:40,459 --> 04:17:47,450
no we already went over this if you like hot sauce then you then it's the same thing all right i can't

1036
04:17:47,450 --> 04:17:54,760
fuck this up i really can i i cannot fuck this up i have to get the hell out of here and go back to

1037
04:17:54,760 --> 04:18:05,610
where i was progressing through the damn game blame the bird blame the fake true ending no and

1038
04:18:05,610 --> 04:18:09,850
i should have known that was gonna happen what just happened right there it's designed to fuck

1039
04:18:09,850 --> 04:18:17,610
with you it's built meticulously this mad scientist game developer sat at every corner

1040
04:18:18,170 --> 04:18:26,579
every single little corner and was like they had cauldrons bubbling behind him it was

1041
04:18:26,579 --> 04:18:46,889
meticulously crafted to fuck with you grunt hilda yeah this is the this is the this game dead is the

1042
04:18:46,889 --> 04:19:02,299
grunt hilda of game development i've devised this is such a fun game

1043
04:19:30,500 --> 04:19:56,309
no no a stupid basketball jump let's just take another guess try to remember the exact well it's

1044
04:19:56,309 --> 04:20:02,729
not the position it's just the time holding the button because no matter what you'll you're never

1045
04:20:02,729 --> 04:20:06,809
gonna do it the same length every time you're all you'll always miss it by like a quarter of a

1046
04:20:06,809 --> 04:20:10,409
second like a tenth of a second it's just like all right no that was a little bit too high but

1047
04:20:10,409 --> 04:20:14,969
i still made it this one you know i'm gonna stand right on the edge and go one two no it's way too

1048
04:20:14,969 --> 04:20:44,120

1301
05:32:57,180 --> 05:33:03,180
i don't think i'm making it to season two because uh we've had about six uh redemption arcs

1302
05:33:04,229 --> 05:33:21,049
and none of them worked out to do this all again god damn it man like why do they why can't they be

1304
05:33:35,930 --> 05:33:45,049
you all of my my like memories all my shit is from like spending two hours up fucking there

1305
05:33:46,380 --> 05:33:53,669
not down here i haven't been down here in like an hour and 20 minutes so now i'm like okay let me

1306
05:33:53,669 --> 05:34:25,979
oh wait i forgot i have to do this whole thing again fucking any memories i have a few just cheat

1307
05:34:26,860 --> 05:34:37,799

1308
05:34:37,799 --> 05:34:51,209
down i technically did and i gotta go all the way back up through that stupid bullshit oh man i am

1309
05:34:52,169 --> 05:35:06,630
oh i i might be defeated here very soon i may be defeated it really depends it depends how many

1310
05:35:06,630 --> 05:35:25,500
times i have to do the beginning of the video game again streamer defeated streamer defeated

1311
05:35:26,220 --> 05:35:34,139
oh yeah fuck man this sucks i don't want to do the green ninja turtle level again

1312
05:35:35,099 --> 05:35:52,470
but i have to remember when i was playing uh simpsons hit and run and i spent what like maybe

1313
05:35:52,549 --> 05:35:56,950
two hours on that last two levels know what i say i was like oh fuck this i'm out of here this

1314
05:35:56,950 --> 05:36:04,540
stupid fucking dumb i hate this and what did i do continue to complain for like three hours

1315
05:36:04,540 --> 05:36:18,490
at that same mission but after that after about four hours what did i do that's right i beat it

1316
05:36:18,490 --> 05:36:26,950
i finished it i think this is a lot different than simpsons hit and run though

1317
05:36:27,669 --> 05:36:35,430
because i don't have to go back and do the first mission of simpsons hit and run i don't have to

1318
05:36:35,430 --> 05:37:03,000
go back uh to chapter one in simpsons hit and run it might be a little different i just want

1319
05:37:03,000 --> 05:37:08,119
to get back up to the wind i just want to see new content i just have to get up there i just have to

1320
05:37:08,119 --> 05:37:15,080
get up there for a third fucking time oh i can get the coin oh my god and that's what this all

1321
05:37:15,080 --> 05:37:45,750

1389
06:00:06,520 --> 06:00:11,720
it's either a hair too short or a hair too high and then you end up all the way back down here

1390
06:00:12,599 --> 06:00:30,229
and then like the whole thing's fucked up we're talking hairs we're talking literal hairs

1391
06:00:31,459 --> 06:00:42,060
on your head are if you fall down to the beginning of the game or not i think that deserves a fucking

1392
06:00:42,060 --> 06:00:51,819
meme review just link this stream like i i make a steam review this is linked this whole stream

1412
06:06:45,770 --> 06:06:50,599
uh in this whole game based on cynicism and torturing yourself that's the whole point of the

1413
06:06:50,599 --> 06:07:43,380
game pog and what was it torture what was it i'm starting to move with the controller now which

1414
06:07:43,380 --> 06:07:57,979

1415
06:07:58,779 --> 06:08:15,369
just accepting that i'm here i'm just here why if it's not if it's not fun no it is

1428
06:12:02,569 --> 06:12:13,299
the way through this game gamer license gone no this is not a game this is a non-canon gamer

1429
06:12:13,299 --> 06:12:21,349
license game not even close this is this is this is like the extended universe for like getting

1430
06:12:21,349 --> 06:12:28,299
extra stamps on your gamer license not even getting one i'm halfway through the game what

1431
06:12:29,959 --> 06:13:02,389
no i'm not you are what are we talking about i'm halfway to my gamer license what are you

1433
06:13:18,330 --> 06:13:23,130
i could we be that close though i mean what would we do if we were that close

1434
06:13:23,130 --> 06:13:26,810
we would probably maybe get a couple of little bit again maybe we get some tunes on

1435
06:14:00,220 --> 06:14:06,060
guys this game is this game's way too hard for me it just is and i've been trying to fight with

1436
06:14:06,060 --> 06:14:12,139
saying like hey is this game like nearly impossible for me to complete oh no no only four percent of

1437
06:14:12,139 --> 06:14:18,619
all humans now i'm one of those four percent of all human beings yeah that's me that's me i'll be

1438
06:14:18,619 --> 06:14:30,180
up there with the trophy no i mean my gamer skill at this point is literally like being able to read

06:22:15,990 --> 06:22:21,990
you said you fucked the whole thing up remember if you do one mistake on one jump is specifically

1474
06:22:21,990 --> 06:22:36,060
some of the it ruins the entire thing you know can't wait for it in 10 years competitive e-sport

1475
06:22:36,060 --> 06:22:47,259
teeth pulling yeah it's gonna be great or who can hit themselves in the face with a chair harder

1482
06:23:51,380 --> 06:24:03,560
if you start winning you want that's not true because even if you do start winning that's the

1483
06:24:03,560 --> 06:24:09,720
beauty of this game even if you do win eventually you're going to miss a jump and come back to level

1484
06:24:09,720 --> 06:24:29,400
two you will see level two again my friend oh yes you will many times he thinks he thinks he's not

1493
06:25:58,659 --> 06:26:13,259
you mean by that your concentration gets maxed out yeah you get to you just everything just starts to

1494
06:26:13,259 --> 06:26:17,500
blend together you don't want to see the crows anymore you don't want to see the green sewer

1495
06:26:17,500 --> 06:26:22,860
anymore and you yeah everything just maxes out there's a finite amount of human brain energy

1496

1502
06:27:33,450 --> 06:27:38,599
brain capacity though on the second or third thunderstruck that i think we were at the end

1503
06:27:39,560 --> 06:27:47,159
yeah like that that thunderstruck replay number two is when i i maxed out every ounce of my

1504
06:27:47,159 --> 06:27:59,860
concentration so we did play what like three or four more times you know i bet you don't say

incredibly difficult no that's that's i'm as it was that was fun but i'm dead that's you're in

1660
07:06:54,279 --> 07:07:10,860
world one i can't believe you kept going well sometimes you just have to go you know what i

1661
07:07:10,860 --> 07:07:22,150
mean he quit streaming six times don't feel pressured to play it tomorrow you can always

1662
07:07:22,150 --> 07:07:26,470
take a break and return another time i know i know but 95 of the stuff i was saying was

1663
07:07:26,470 --> 07:07:37,689
bullshit anyways you know that all right let's go back uh to let me make sure here

1664
07:07:41,349 --> 07:07:49,430
we are going to do the the the couple hours that we played that minecraft event i do want to go

1665
07:07:49,430 --> 07:08:02,680
over some of them at least the ones that i didn't get to catch so these are from the minecraft

1666
07:08:02,680 --> 07:08:16,009
stream uh so from yesterday we had 500 bits from trident jacks thank you trident jacks said what the

1667
07:08:16,009 --> 07:08:22,599
fuck germa sad vega 250 yesterday i greatly enjoyed this you kind of went a little mad

1668
07:08:22,599 --> 07:08:27,560
with power here though yeah that if you if you didn't uh catch the beginning of the stream

1669
07:08:28,520 --> 07:08:35,159
that what we did yesterday was a glorified stress test beta test none of the systems were in place

1670
07:08:35,159 --> 07:08:43,479
the twitch integration wasn't in place the server had some issues and um there was no permadeath

1671
07:08:45,080 --> 07:08:51,610
we just were like you know what let's just go and just have collect data because even

1672
07:08:51,610 --> 07:08:55,529
if you do a stress test when potentially thousands of people are trying to do the

1673
07:08:55,529 --> 07:08:59,529
same thing at the same time uh there's a lot of things that you need to collect

1674
07:09:00,090 --> 07:09:07,830
in regards to how that's even going to work the next time we do that it's going to be put in

1675
07:09:07,830 --> 07:09:17,000
the oven for a little longer so it will be more of the game that we were going to play

1676
07:09:17,639 --> 07:09:24,279
rather than the streams an hour late let's just dump on a bunch of people with no whitelisting

1677
07:09:27,049 --> 07:09:31,369
and like in the future the guards aren't going to be that powerful they're not going to be able

1678
07:09:31,369 --> 07:09:42,119
to teleport that it was really just to keep the peace for a stress test essentially they collected

1679
07:09:42,119 --> 07:09:56,599
our data no no no i'm saying like for the server to be hit that hard keep the peace right so thanks

1680
07:09:56,599 --> 07:10:01,000
for helping us do that because the next time we do it it'll be a lot more fleshed out

1681
07:10:01,720 --> 07:10:12,389
uh thank you nat for the 500 bits creatures rule gave five community subs yesterday as well

1682
07:10:14,069 --> 07:10:19,590
siku gave ten dollars yesterday ten thousand bits they said it's 4 a.m i've been up for a good 24

1683
07:10:19,590 --> 07:10:30,659
hours good morning apparently i get to catch the stream start for once damn yeah none of the guards

1684
07:10:30,659 --> 07:10:37,580
were in creative mode they could just move around and when the game is actually played

1685
07:10:38,139 --> 07:10:42,779
and there's actual permadeath involved and this actual stamina system is actually working

1686
07:10:42,779 --> 07:10:51,290
correctly and everything there will be things in place to make it so it's not just messy the

1687
07:10:51,290 --> 07:10:59,020
first like hour that you play the game yeah the the devs were in creative not the guards right

1688
07:10:59,020 --> 07:11:08,360
yeah is my minecraft mod going to be more or less disappointing than star citizen

1689
07:11:09,159 --> 07:11:14,759
well i'll give you a couple of quick strong differences here uh my minecraft mod events

1690
07:11:15,240 --> 07:11:21,939
uh did not cost 150 million dollars and i didn't start making them 10 years ago

1691
07:11:23,209 --> 07:11:37,209
so there's that oh sorry 280 million dollars right but thank you siku dark soul thanks to

1692
07:11:37,209 --> 07:11:41,849
the 250 bits here's some bits someone apparently stole my minecraft account i haven't used in eight

1693
07:11:41,849 --> 07:11:56,860
years four days ago what can we play cube world instead cube world that's not cool siku again

1694
07:11:56,860 --> 07:12:01,099
thanks to the 500 bits buy a five dollar mic for an upgrade that will be fixed next time as well

1695
07:12:01,099 --> 07:12:04,939
we were trying a different streaming setup so we could show different perspectives of cameras

1696
07:12:05,500 --> 07:12:09,900
but there's probably just going to be two streams next time and i'm just going to squad

1697
07:12:09,900 --> 07:12:16,299
with the other streaming account that's filming stuff so there'll be a squad stream of all the

1698
07:12:16,299 --> 07:12:23,750
stuff going on but it'll be on a separate stream so then you can get like my actual full perspective

1699
07:12:24,709 --> 07:12:29,880
if you don't ever want to see anything else i'm guessing you were talking through discord yeah

1700
07:12:29,880 --> 07:12:35,659
we've been to that i had like a line into my ear where they could tell me things that were you

1701
07:12:35,659 --> 07:12:44,220
know problems that were happening or whatever will that work for a vod um you would just have

1702
07:12:44,220 --> 07:12:48,700
to go to both channels and just queue them up at the same time and just play them at the same time

1703
07:12:50,950 --> 07:12:54,790
because that seems like the best way to make it so i can actually just show my perspective

1704
07:12:55,430 --> 07:13:07,939
always turn off channel points they're garbage this is not the jeremy i love

1705
07:13:09,529 --> 07:13:16,970
um i i didn't even know they were on until they turned on into beta uh like six hours ago

1706
07:13:18,169 --> 07:13:25,500
i don't i didn't even know i had them i didn't even know i had them i'm just going to change

1707
07:13:25,500 --> 07:13:34,099
them to be something it's going to be like 50 000 points to get me to do something i don't know

1708
07:13:34,659 --> 07:13:42,069
i'm gonna up the value i'm gonna up the values and add like three things like you know oh you

1709
07:13:42,069 --> 07:13:47,029
can use like the emote i think that's interesting use emotes for a while you can unlock an emote

1710
07:13:47,029 --> 07:13:54,389
also um for a hundred thousand for for 500 million channel points uh like the old pepsi

1711
07:13:54,389 --> 07:14:08,540
commercials you get a jet remember that for for for 500 million germa channel points

1712
07:14:09,259 --> 07:14:13,340
and then the thing flies down and lands and it's like you could be an owner of a jet

1713
07:14:18,759 --> 07:14:22,759
didn't and somebody here's the funny thing somebody actually that was like a joke

1714
07:14:22,759 --> 07:14:28,840
that pepsi did and i think it was so out of reach that no one was ever going to be able to do it

1715
07:14:29,479 --> 07:14:33,959
somebody did it and they didn't know what to do because they didn't have a jet

1716
07:14:34,680 --> 07:14:41,939
right am i remembering this correctly yeah they got sued and they got a monetary prize instead yep

1717
07:14:44,119 --> 07:14:50,139
that's so funny some dude ended up with 10 000 pepsi uh 10 million pepsi points whatever

1718
07:14:50,779 --> 07:15:09,590
how would you get that many got sued over it but no i'll have something stupid maybe

1719
07:15:10,389 --> 07:15:14,549
maybe you can redeem like 10 000 channel points and i'll like turn my face cam on and like give

1720
07:15:14,549 --> 07:15:19,909
you a wink although that would probably get kind of annoying you would have to be high enough

1721
07:15:19,909 --> 07:15:33,340
where it would not ruin every stream so it would only happen like once in a while but anyways uh

1722
07:15:33,340 --> 07:15:36,779
thank you tingy for the 250 it sucks that i wasn't able to join the server but the stream was

1723
07:15:36,779 --> 07:15:40,860
enjoyable nonetheless hopefully in the future everything will be sorted tons of love to you

1724
07:15:40,860 --> 07:15:49,220
and the devs for putting so much work into this yeah once we actually get it off the ground

1725
07:15:50,810 --> 07:15:59,209
i at least want to do i want to do one or two of them at least with all the rules in place and

1726
07:15:59,209 --> 07:16:07,049
all the stuff in place last night is not an indicator of how those streams are going to go

1727
07:16:11,529 --> 07:16:17,700
so just you know be aware of that peaceful hailey thanks for the 250 hey germa so glad

1728
07:16:17,700 --> 07:16:22,099
you were doing a minecraft stream it was a ton of fun the two times i got in but i can't wait till

1729
07:16:22,099 --> 07:16:26,659
we get twitch authorization in so we can have organized fun but this was still awesome happy

1730
07:16:26,659 --> 07:16:31,819
i got to play in the server with you in chat have a good night yeah because it was there was like

1731
07:16:31,819 --> 07:16:36,360
you said there was no white list it was anyone with minecraft could just join that server

1732
07:16:37,240 --> 07:16:45,450
we had two there's like three four servers yeah we just we got this kinks to work out and i knew

1733
07:16:45,450 --> 07:16:56,009
that was gonna happen should be fun once we get it truly off the ground though oh also important

1734
07:16:56,729 --> 07:17:00,810
over the next couple of days because we're getting to the end of the year here

1735
07:17:04,009 --> 07:17:10,389
there's going to be uh i feel like once every two or three weeks there's another channel that

1736
07:17:10,389 --> 07:17:14,790
gets opened up into the discord i have more channels in my discord than i think most people

1737
07:17:14,790 --> 07:17:20,810
do i just open up new channels every fucking week there will be a new channel in the discord

1738
07:17:20,810 --> 07:17:28,810
to discuss nominations for the end of the year for the new year's eve stream i want to get that

1739
07:17:28,810 --> 07:17:40,740
ball rolling because i want to be able to get the nomination videos ready and not scramble to get

1740
07:17:40,740 --> 07:17:47,939
them done in three days like last year so expect some nomination discussions i am going to put

1741
07:17:48,979 --> 07:17:55,689
a pinned message in there to make sure that people know the nominations and you can discuss

1742
07:17:55,770 --> 07:18:10,729
them and nominate stuff that stream feels like it was yesterday yeah that was almost one full year

1743
07:18:10,729 --> 07:18:35,930
ago 365 days ago do your best to ignore the pin the passage of time yeah but uh volemy gave five

1744
07:18:35,930 --> 07:18:40,970
thousand bits fifty dollars yesterday and want to make sure i talk about it because that's a lot of

1745
07:18:40,970 --> 07:18:45,849
money to give and have not been addressed they said chat now is the time to rise up viva la

1746
07:18:45,849 --> 07:18:50,729
revolution i may have even caught it but i don't think i did and i want to make sure i did

1747
07:18:50,729 --> 07:19:01,290
i was kind of locked in thank you volemy sad vega thanks for the 250 i can't believe what a violent

1748
07:19:01,290 --> 07:19:05,770
wretched king you became so quickly mad with power telling people to die simply for voicing

1749
07:19:05,770 --> 07:19:13,700
their opinions about bread and the king's age your kingdom starves and you cackle with glee

1750
07:19:14,580 --> 07:19:35,380
uh did i you know did i cackle all right this is not even this uh this is really this is really

1751
07:19:35,380 --> 07:19:40,340
fucking funny this one this is not at the the bit threshold but i'm going to read it because this

1752
07:19:40,340 --> 07:19:51,259
is actually really funny um it's just funny this is funny ultra levin said i managed to throw an

1753
07:19:51,259 --> 07:19:58,139
egg at you and land it three times the first time it almost crashed the server i got really worried

1754
07:20:03,080 --> 07:20:10,869
throwing an egg and going oh shit did i do that it did crash the server oh yeah because there

1755
07:20:10,869 --> 07:20:17,400
were chickens that were spawned everywhere right yeah it spawned five chickens and the server went

1756
07:20:17,400 --> 07:20:29,720
down that's right i'm surprised at what you guys would have could accomplish and like all right

1757
07:20:29,720 --> 07:20:35,959
let's be real here the amount of stuff that you guys did i didn't even know what's going on outside

1758
07:20:35,959 --> 07:20:41,779
the community i was we would we were like killing people and i was trying not to die and we were

1759
07:20:41,779 --> 07:20:47,340
walking around i was putting people in fighting pits and shit and then we walk around the

1760
07:20:47,340 --> 07:20:53,139
community there's like a whole this is like farms that were done there was a secret town

1761
07:20:53,939 --> 07:21:10,279
i was just running around like an idiot make a more static secondary server yeah i i'm trying

1762
07:21:10,279 --> 07:21:14,599
to toy with the idea that if this goes well for a couple times we just have fun for a few

1763
07:21:14,680 --> 07:21:26,389
like the event the event of permadeath and fighting and taking on each other and having

1764
07:21:26,389 --> 07:21:32,709
stuff happen and if you die you're out and come fuck the king right it might actually be kind

1765
07:21:32,709 --> 07:21:38,950
of fun just to have i can i'm not going to guarantee to have something like this permanently

1766
07:21:39,909 --> 07:21:51,419
right but like you still have a secondary server that's not as big that's just a for fun server

1767
07:21:54,900 --> 07:22:00,470
it may be like to have it up for like a few months and just have people go in and play and

1768
07:22:00,470 --> 07:22:05,110
do whatever they want and just put some interesting rules on it and then we could go in and you know

1769
07:22:05,110 --> 07:22:12,740
take a take a look at it every now and then but i don't i don't know last time i did that i had

1770
07:22:12,740 --> 07:22:18,020
a tf2 server for a while and it just i just couldn't manage it and i would have to like

1771
07:22:18,020 --> 07:22:24,099
bring on people to manage it and keep them around and they'd have to be the ones managing everything

1772
07:22:25,139 --> 07:22:30,380
they would have to be people that were like on call to run that server and i don't know if i

1773
07:22:31,020 --> 07:22:39,720
am ready to make that commitment right now because there's a bunch of other stuff that

1774
07:22:39,720 --> 07:22:43,479
i currently want to do and i wouldn't be able to keep up with it really at all

1775
07:22:44,439 --> 07:22:53,139
just make your mods do it no i would why would i do that hey all right now you guys now have to

1776
07:22:53,139 --> 07:23:01,700
manage a minecraft server thanks bye the mods are people man they got stuff going on they got

1777
07:23:01,700 --> 07:23:29,130

1782
07:24:02,729 --> 07:24:06,169
you guys were into it and interested but we would have that to be a process to pick that you know

1783
07:24:07,209 --> 07:24:14,810
i wouldn't want just to be like it would have to maybe we'll go and get into that another time

1813
07:28:12,180 --> 07:28:17,930
people at the same time maybe it'll be fun before i get rid of this server to just get a bunch of

1814
07:28:17,930 --> 07:28:23,049
people on and build a dirt dick like the biggest dirt dick that anyone's ever built in minecraft i

1838
07:32:03,740 --> 07:32:09,500
going to go any further on the characters so what you do in minecraft is it's pretty simple

1839
07:32:09,500 --> 07:32:14,540
you go around or you collect resources and you fight months what the hell is it what the

1840
07:32:14,540 --> 07:32:19,979
fuck is this what is going on here what is this a ninja turtles what the fuck are the ninja turtles

1841
07:32:19,979 --> 07:32:28,470
doing in this game look it's leonardo let's turn it tell him behind him what are you doing this game

1842
07:32:29,509 --> 07:32:37,110
i don't i have no what am i supposed to even be doing does anybody know what you do in this game

1843
07:32:37,110 --> 07:32:42,790
i have not figured out all i've done is was it a b it's a fucking b come on still true

1844
07:32:43,909 --> 07:32:49,349
the real awesome part about this game is the fact that i'm battling right now as a frog there's

1845
07:32:49,349 --> 07:32:54,389
never been a game in existence where you could fight people as frogs it just never existed

1846
07:32:54,389 --> 07:32:59,110
and that's why i like it and that's the f5 experience points right there ladies and

1847
07:32:59,110 --> 07:33:05,060
gentlemen i just figured out how to play cube world i'm concerned about the people who made

1848
07:33:05,060 --> 07:33:09,380
this game because they're gonna get fucking sued first this is ninja turtles and then look

1849
07:33:09,380 --> 07:33:14,500
it's the seven dwarfs disney is gonna have a field day with these guys i look at a snuffy

1850
07:33:14,500 --> 07:33:19,939
that's gruffy that's poopy and snoopy see that's the seven dwarfs how are they not gonna get

1851
07:33:19,939 --> 07:33:25,220
sued by this there's funny i i really am concerned i'm gonna let me go get a closer look here

1852
07:33:25,220 --> 07:33:34,259
all right fluffy you need to go back to disney world because i said so what what

1853
07:33:35,139 --> 07:33:40,180

1854
07:33:40,900 --> 07:33:49,540
oh would you look who it is everybody it's donatello by himself without his boys hey donnie

to hit public on them guys i really don't know if you want to see more of my minecraft uh my my

1895
07:38:19,830 --> 07:38:24,790
gameplay here i don't know i wish this is episode three let me know in the car by the way i already

1896
07:38:24,790 --> 07:38:33,400
have 15 of these done and they're already uploaded i'm going to upload them regardless of what happens

1897
07:38:33,400 --> 07:38:56,869
in this video do people still do that they don't still do that do they they do i thought that if

1898
07:38:56,869 --> 07:39:04,459
not time would have gone by are people still giving away xboxes but now you go to ring a bell too

1899
07:39:05,099 --> 07:39:21,500
they give away iphones now i remember doing a giveaway before i remember i gave away like a mouse

1900
07:39:22,860 --> 07:39:31,340
i wonder if this person is still around in the community because i i got a mouse and i remember

1901
07:39:31,340 --> 07:39:38,790
given it was like a razor it was one of the razor mice it had nothing to do there was no like

1902
07:39:38,790 --> 07:39:43,270
sponsorship it was just like i had this mouse and i was like oh fuck i got i i think i didn't

1903
07:39:43,270 --> 07:39:52,979
want it or i didn't like it or something i think maybe i bought i had two of them i don't remember

1904
07:39:52,979 --> 07:40:01,290
what it did it was like 10 years ago but i i mailed somebody a mouse i wonder if that person's still

1905
07:40:01,290 --> 07:40:11,619
around i wonder what if the way that if they still have that mouse do you ever miss the old early

1906
07:40:11,619 --> 07:40:22,180
days yeah sometimes but it's i mean it's like a different mindset though sometimes you know i

1907
07:40:22,180 --> 07:40:28,360
miss like making these old the little youtube videos you know i like the ones from like 2012

1908
07:40:30,380 --> 07:40:41,110
i think it was it was a lot simpler back then in regards to like grandpa's gonna just

1909
07:40:41,909 --> 07:40:48,330
do a cube world video and if i'm gonna get like chased around by monsters for two minutes you

1910
07:40:48,330 --> 07:40:58,650
know what i mean it was just like yeah it was just like kind of simple but if we're talking like

1911
07:40:58,650 --> 07:41:03,610
2011 2012 i mean that that's just the kind of videos people were making it's videos i thought

1912
07:41:03,610 --> 07:41:11,610
were fun and interesting 20 like 14 15 16 is when i really started to try to make a bunch of shit

1913
07:41:11,610 --> 07:41:20,459
that i really wanted to put time and effort into and yeah i do miss the it's just it's never gonna

1914
07:41:20,459 --> 07:41:26,490
come back though that that's not gonna happen anymore like 2013 to like 2016 2017 really

1915
07:41:27,049 --> 07:41:36,169
is like i spent i mean i stream like this streams almost eight hours long right i streamed yesterday

1916
07:41:36,729 --> 07:41:40,810
for a few hours i mean that typically it would be longer than that but because we would test on the

1917
07:41:40,810 --> 07:41:48,439
server but it's not like i'm spending less time or more time sometimes i would spend

1918
07:41:49,159 --> 07:41:55,060
four three four five days straight on a video you know like i i'm live three or four times a week

1919
07:41:56,540 --> 07:42:02,220
with what i don't know what like i average for hours a week on stream like actually turned on

1920
07:42:02,220 --> 07:42:08,919
it's probably i mean if i my average stream is six and a half to seven hours six to seven hours

1921
07:42:11,180 --> 07:42:19,099
seven like 14 21 to like maybe maybe like 20 to 25 to 35 hours a week on stream like on broadcast

1922
07:42:19,900 --> 07:42:28,169
if i was going to make a youtube video on a game it would probably be like

1923
07:42:28,810 --> 07:42:40,279
30 hours in one session to do like one video so that makes like that makes sense do i have

1924
07:42:40,279 --> 07:42:46,020
an alternate path in case twitch doesn't work out well here's the thing about that question twitch

1925
07:42:46,020 --> 07:43:00,869
already has worked out a lot so it's not like oh i i have i have plans when i don't know whenever

1926
07:43:00,869 --> 07:43:05,590
this starts to people start to lose interest i i have like little contingency plans of what i want

1927
07:43:05,590 --> 07:43:16,330
to do but i don't i wouldn't look back and be like oh man this didn't work out i'm doing something

1928
07:43:16,330 --> 07:43:23,189
that i've wanted to do my whole life i've already i've already achieved my dreams

1929
07:43:24,540 --> 07:43:32,310
of just doing stuff like this so i would never look back and be like oh damn like let's say this

1930
07:43:32,310 --> 07:43:36,389
over the next few years let's say viewership drops or you know it's okay well that's

1931
07:43:37,430 --> 07:43:44,569
whatever you know i i i did everything i wanted to do in regards to like audience level and

1932
07:43:45,209 --> 07:43:53,020
engagement with people and but i don't even i don't even look at it like that seriously like

1933
07:43:53,020 --> 07:43:58,659
whatever happens tomorrow i have to see what happens tomorrow two or three weeks from now

1934
07:43:58,659 --> 07:44:06,409
we'll see i don't know i'm just riding the wave and just doing it for fun and just trying to stay

1935
07:44:06,409 --> 07:44:10,250
on the i'm just trying to stay on the surfboard and we'll see where the where the water goes i

1936
07:44:10,250 --> 07:44:24,869
have no idea you're the number one jump king streamer on twitch i don't think that's true i

1937
07:44:24,869 --> 07:44:30,069
think a lot of uh big streamers have played jump king i don't i think i'd be pretty far down on

1938
07:44:30,069 --> 07:44:42,250
that list so i don't know about that probably not even now right but it's always nice to reminisce

1939
07:44:42,250 --> 07:44:48,409
and i do forget some things what is this germa sandler oh can anybody i before i we have like

1966
07:48:57,720 --> 07:49:01,400
i had fun playing for five minutes until you died in the lake for real though the best part of the

1967
07:49:01,400 --> 07:49:05,000
stream in my opinion was seeing what the community build i would love a community server that you

1968
07:49:05,000 --> 07:49:11,799
visit every month or so that's maybe we'll see maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe i don't know

07:49:11,799 --> 07:49:15,319
maybe hold on to that idea sigmatic thanks for a thousand bits

1970
07:49:21,689 --> 07:49:29,900

1971
07:49:29,900 --> 07:49:40,709

1972
07:49:40,709 --> 07:49:48,250
they're talking about today or yesterday uh with some tweaking of the guards and fixing

1973
07:49:48,250 --> 07:50:01,000
hardcore this will be sick as hell yes i know no stream is as bad as the surge was the surge is

1974
07:50:01,959 --> 07:50:06,439
it was the that was one of the worst just that that really was the worst stream i probably ever

1975
07:50:06,439 --> 07:50:13,299
did i don't remember it that's because it was so awful that you you just refused to acknowledge

that never happens to me is that shit set up do we know anybody know is that shit just like set up

2070
08:05:10,970 --> 08:05:15,590
is that just like an ad was that an ad did i get added i think i might have been i think i got

2071
08:05:15,590 --> 08:05:24,900
baited by the ad is that is that really happening is coke gaming like giving community subs to

2072
08:05:24,979 --> 08:05:33,860
people like subway was i don't know you have to be partnered oh you have to get partnered

2074
08:05:47,560 --> 08:05:51,799
know why but i thought it was just coke gaming was going into random streams and just dropping

2075
08:05:51,799 --> 08:07:15,740
subs and stuff with like a message like this you can always tell when a brand doesn't give a shit

2076
08:07:15,740 --> 08:07:23,340
if they literally get your name wrong in what they're doing or if they just pick a random

2077
08:07:23,340 --> 08:07:37,479
video or a random stream that you've ever done dude germa we here at brand so so much loved

2087
08:08:56,950 --> 08:09:10,900
i oh look i have to say this because when will we ever evolve advertising and like pr

2088
08:09:10,900 --> 08:09:18,819
shit why does it have to be the same way that it's just been forever like that shit nobody

2089
08:09:18,819 --> 08:09:28,340
that doesn't work nobody gives a shit about that like that it doesn't do anything for anybody

2090
08:09:29,700 --> 08:09:37,590
we need to change the way that we advertise because the current system is just annoying

2091
08:09:39,819 --> 08:09:53,639
don't you want your brand to not be associated with i'm fucking irritating you sound like a

2092
08:09:53,639 --> 08:10:06,470
ted x talker they're literally all out of touch it's just gonna get worse do your own advertising

2093
08:10:06,470 --> 08:10:15,959
and get paid for it are the advertising needs to be i don't i just feel like random video ads just

2094
08:10:15,959 --> 08:10:29,819
don't do it anymore modern advertising is just dude relatable yeah but it's dude relatable with

2095
08:10:29,819 --> 08:10:36,630
like a 30 year old medium that they're trying to still do it's dude relatable but with tactics

2096
08:10:36,630 --> 08:10:43,590
that we've been doing since the 60s you can't be dude relatable when you're not at all and you're

2097
08:10:43,590 --> 08:10:59,860
using marketing strategies from 1965 what's something that i recently bought from an ad

2098
08:11:01,909 --> 08:11:15,319
um i don't know not nothing on the internet because it seems like all internet ads

2099
08:11:16,200 --> 08:11:22,139
are for like jokey food companies that i'm not going to eat you know what i mean most of the

2100
08:11:22,139 --> 08:11:30,599
online ads are weird shitty mobile games that nobody wants to play and 600 calorie per serving

2101
08:11:31,770 --> 08:11:50,099
like garbage can fucking food i don't i don't that doesn't appeal to me at all and cars

2102
08:11:51,419 --> 08:12:01,930
yeah and cars you should do a stream where we watch ads and then rate them well found the

2103
08:12:01,930 --> 08:12:11,959
fucking account found found the like the hidden advertising account here oh dude yeah it's so

2104
08:12:11,959 --> 08:12:19,049
fucked up you should watch a bunch of ads on money stream that would be like crazy right epic

2105
08:12:19,049 --> 08:12:26,779
yeah because you're epic but may i recommend some coke ads uh maybe if you think that would be cool

2106
08:12:27,799 --> 08:12:33,479
i they made a few good ones i think recently there are some very cool racing coke ads you

2107
08:12:33,479 --> 08:12:47,319
should check them out all right let's go let's go i i could sit here all day and talk about brands

2108
08:12:47,319 --> 08:12:57,509
and advertising even i don't i never ran ads on this stream ever unless it was like a joke

2109
08:12:57,509 --> 08:13:04,860
because like i don't what i don't care if i'm gonna something good if someone's gonna advertise to you

2110
08:13:04,860 --> 08:13:10,700
it's gonna be me you know what i mean i want you to hear it from my mouth i want you to hear it from

2111
08:13:10,700 --> 08:13:40,650
me anybody getting ad uh i don't think i get ad i i don't think my ads work on this channel

2112
08:13:43,319 --> 08:13:52,310
i don't think they do i've tried to run ads no they don't i don't i i have tried to run an ad

2113
08:13:52,310 --> 08:13:58,759
from my dashboard it's running right now it says 28 seconds remaining did they remove my ads can

2114
08:13:58,759 --> 08:14:08,500
i no longer send ads to anybody if i said this too many times it's saying this is 15 seconds

2115
08:14:08,500 --> 08:14:17,819
remaining all right okay 12 seconds why did i lose the ability to run ads on my channel

2116
08:14:20,169 --> 08:14:41,959
three two one complete okay welcome back um did anybody see an ad no no no okay so

2117
08:14:41,959 --> 08:14:50,250
hey twitch i just i just want to make sure that you have twitch like twitch listen to me um

2118
08:14:52,310 --> 08:15:01,959
if i run an ad this is good data for you if i run an advertisement and nobody sees it

2119
08:15:03,880 --> 08:15:10,970
what in the ever-living fuck is the reason for running ads what's the point of running ads if

2120
08:15:10,970 --> 08:15:15,369
like 75 percent of all people are not going to see them because they have like ad block

2121
08:15:15,930 --> 08:15:29,659
they're subbed what's why they what is this for it's more like 95 percent i i

2122
08:15:30,779 --> 08:15:37,020
the last few times that i've ran ads i have thought they have not worked because you guys

2123
08:15:37,020 --> 08:15:47,900
tell me you don't get them isn't this something else that we could do here why do we we're still

2124
08:15:47,900 --> 08:15:53,849
doing ads old school video ads that everyone's gonna skip anyways that anyone everyone is going

2125
08:15:53,849 --> 08:16:11,509
to just not see because they block them i don't get it i don't get it hey guys let's do another

2126
08:16:11,509 --> 08:16:19,700
one why are we talking about ads it's important stuff i want you to i want you to be aware of it

2127
08:16:20,630 --> 08:16:23,909
no i know there's it like this for like the for like the 10 percent of you that actually get

2128
08:16:23,909 --> 08:16:38,220
these i'm not going to put you through that again jerma is deprogramming his audience what

2129
08:16:41,610 --> 08:16:49,540
he's deprogramming his audience what are you talking about you're unplugging

2130
08:16:54,650 --> 08:16:59,369
i just don't see the point of running ads and twitch is like oh give us feedback on our ad

2131
08:16:59,369 --> 08:17:05,610
program here it is uh if there's 2,600 people here let's say there was there was 6,000 people

2132
08:17:05,610 --> 08:17:11,459
here six to what 7,000 people here at the peak of the stream if like 300 of them get ads

2133
08:17:12,099 --> 08:17:37,400

08:28:18,380 --> 08:28:23,819
rooting for you it's great i do think you can make it to the top it's more up your alley than

2211
08:28:23,819 --> 08:28:29,860
getting over it in my opinion also apparently there's a surge too now you guys did get behind

2212
08:28:29,860 --> 08:28:35,990
me you did that's why i didn't stop i was like yeah talking a bunch of shit and it was a little

2213
08:28:35,990 --> 08:28:41,270
angry and i was like what the but then you then you guys got behind me and you were just like

2214
08:28:41,270 --> 08:28:45,830
cheering me on and i'm like i can't stop and then i had to pretend to be normal for a raid

2215
08:28:46,790 --> 08:29:04,729
so and then we had we just kept going that was a push that we needed and then you talked to

2216
08:29:04,729 --> 08:29:21,209
yourself immediately after very normal you pretend to be normal every raid do i he does

2217
08:29:25,259 --> 08:29:32,709
what do you mean what is that but what does that mean you go into tuber mode

2218
08:29:39,459 --> 08:29:43,459
you have a raid personality you act like you're in front of your parents

2219
08:29:50,439 --> 08:29:55,319
yeah but think about it okay listen this is important if a bunch of new people that have

2268
08:35:31,610 --> 08:35:40,630
advertising advertising is really strange and the way that we advertise to each other i think it's

2269
08:35:40,630 --> 08:35:46,229
a human thing you know we got to be more human way more human than we are than we already are

2270
08:35:48,569 --> 08:35:54,020
so we can move on from that really really good deep uh intelligent conversation that's happening

2271
08:35:54,020 --> 08:35:58,819
on my live stream that's what we do we have and that's why a ton of people if you're like

2272
08:35:58,819 --> 08:36:03,299
into that kind of thing you like we have a lot of interesting conversations on this stream um

2273
08:36:04,419 --> 08:36:21,540
yeah that's true we need yeah we oh what is what's going on somebody's somebody's here i don't

2277
08:36:56,439 --> 08:37:03,560
my stream we do we have a uh once a month we do this thing we read a book on stream on my stream

2278
08:37:03,639 --> 08:37:10,200
we do um we read a book on stream and we go over it with each other we each person in chat does it

2279
08:37:10,200 --> 08:37:15,400
does one page uh and then we say it out loud kind of like you guys remember how much fun that was

2280
08:37:16,040 --> 08:37:20,360
when we would uh you'd go around the classroom and everyone would read like two paragraphs and

2281
08:37:20,360 --> 08:37:24,520
it was the dumbest fucking thing on earth and for some reason the teacher thought that that was a

2282
08:37:24,520 --> 08:37:31,560
good idea to have everybody not be able to do any reading comprehension and have like 25 to 30

2283
08:37:31,560 --> 08:37:36,119
people all read out loud in different voices for different characters i loved it when it got to my

2284
08:37:36,119 --> 08:37:40,759
part because i would just i was always hoping there would be a quote you know what i mean

2285
08:37:40,759 --> 08:37:44,279
because it was like oh and then that person said i would just put on voice on i'd be like

2286
08:37:44,279 --> 08:37:52,040
get out of here you you bastard and everyone would go whoa that was such a good what easy to do voices

2287
08:37:52,040 --> 08:37:57,939
and i'm like yeah i gotta bow and i gotta bow and then i get up and i teach the class

2288
08:37:58,580 --> 08:38:05,369
and the teacher sits down starts listening to me see germa has lost the germa germa's having a

2289
08:38:06,729 --> 08:38:30,810
