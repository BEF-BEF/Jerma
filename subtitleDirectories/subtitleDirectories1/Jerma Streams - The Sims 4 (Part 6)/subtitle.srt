1
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:42,469
I hope I haven't saved in the right spot because right immediately after, I believe it was

2
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:49,740
some poison it has to be disposed of coming up here at the birthday party. Otto's good.

3
00:00:49,740 --> 00:01:04,299
Otto's fine. Just needed some routine checkup and he needed his shot. So he's good. If you

4
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:13,890
don't know, Otto has Addison's disease. So he needs, essentially for the rest of his life,

5
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:22,989
he needs to get a injection to help stop some of the symptoms. But he lives a perfectly normal,

6
00:01:22,989 --> 00:01:30,430
happy life on the medication. And he's coming on, I think, 13 or 14 years old here. He's doing great.

7
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:43,379
But anyways, what up? Pod watchers skip. It's the intro. Actually, if you could skip the intro,

8
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:49,500
you could. Actually, I don't disagree with what you said. But you're going to miss a very important

9
00:01:49,500 --> 00:02:02,620
announcement. Very important coming up here. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you,

10
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:13,439
the nominees are open for the end of the year awards. You find your way over in the discord.

11
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,139
There's a channel there is going to be some rules you need to follow.

12
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:25,039
Please submit any clips over the year for new viewers. This is actually we probably should

13
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:32,960
talk about this. So a lot of people here may have joined this community in the last six, 12 months.

14
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,969
So let me just break this down if you don't know what we do. At the end of the year,

15
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:44,740
we do an award show for the channel. And it's not just the best things that have happened here. It's

16
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:51,090
also the worst things that have happened here. We're talking best joke and worst joke. We're

17
00:02:51,090 --> 00:03:00,900
talking best stream and worst stream. We're talking worst face worst hair. So it's it's usually pretty

18
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:06,659
much you're trying to find some of these things that make sense those categories. There are a

19
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:11,419
couple of new categories this year. Some of you might be really happy to know. For instance,

20
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:18,879
uh, we didn't know whether the title of best or worst, because it makes sense both ways.

21
00:03:20,689 --> 00:03:29,409
Best face, no, no, no, best, um, best overdone Boston moment or worst overdone Boston moment.

22
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:36,180
We really didn't know what to call it. It's kind of just best overdone Boston moment. And I'll give

23
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:43,969
you an example. Oh, I got a fucking Starbucks here, dude. Good luck, because I don't even know

24
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:52,539
what you're gonna find. I don't know. There's only like three times this ever happened. I think

25
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:59,620
we literally only know of like three. Who knows? Maybe some of you might find a bunch of them. I

26
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:07,419
don't know. That's the fun with these awards is a lot of them are just kind of horseshit.

27
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:15,340
And trying to figure out what people actually find is part of the fun, right? Like worst

28
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:20,139
Boston overdone moment. It's like, what the fuck are you? What are you talking about?

29
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:34,269
Good luck. Best sound, worst sound. Yep. And yes, some best sounds will be on the worst sound list

30
00:04:34,269 --> 00:04:40,350
and some worst sounds will also be on the best sound list. I don't make the rules, except I do.

31
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:52,319
I made all the rules. So follow them. Of course I made the rules. What about the example you just

32
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:59,300
gave? Can we nominate that? Yes, nominations. It's going to be kind of like it was last year. So

33
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:05,060
because this is happening not on New Year's Eve anymore, this is happening on around Christmas

34
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:12,050
time. So it's going to be pulled back a week or two. This show we need to. So I think it was,

35
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:20,100
what was it? December from December, I think like 15th or something last year and forward till we

36
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:27,569
close nominations in a couple of weeks. So we, I think what we need to do is figure out what was

37
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:34,750
the cutoff period last year. I think it was like December 10th last year. So anything December

38
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:46,939
12th or 15th forward, right, is what way you can pull clips from. When are you going to play modded

39
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:53,040
Skyrim? I installed like 150 Skyrim mods and bricked my computer. So I just was like, I just

40
00:05:53,040 --> 00:06:03,759
uninstalled everything. You know, it wasn't a virus. It just like a Skyrim just wouldn't open

41
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:16,990
anymore. So I was like, fuck, this is, I don't even know what's wrong. But anyways, yeah. So

42
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:20,990
the pinned message that you just saw in the chat, there is a nominations channel.

43
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:27,699
That's where you go. We have a form after the nominations close, kind of compile everything,

44
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:34,540
kind of vet a bunch of the responses and you will be able to vote as of the second week of December.

45
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:40,139
I would say that we're trying to have submissions close for nominations on the 4th of December,

46
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:47,740
which then you will be able to vote from the 6th or 7th of December all the way till about a day

47
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:55,500
or so before the show. Go check the channel. And if you don't even, again, this was a lot

48
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,459
of new people here probably. If you don't know what I'm talking about, go, go skim through some

49
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:07,620
of the previous years. This is the fifth year going on by the way. All right. I don't care.

50
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:15,089
Do a Mario voice. Okay. Hello. Now go nominate something. Okay. I just did that for you. So,

51
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:19,649
you know, go do something for me. Go nominate something. All right. We're going to go back

52
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:22,930
to the McNulty house. We are going to open this right where we left off. We were in the middle

53
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:30,639
of my birthday party. Well, it's not my birthday party, but it was McNulty's birthday party.

54
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:43,660
Invited all of his friends. We're going to continue this saga. I'm ready to go. Oh, by the way,

55
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,620
there's a, there's an a hundred thieves video that's on the hundred thieves channel.

56
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:55,889
I was on the JHB show, TBH with JHB. It was pretty fun. It was cool. You want to go check it out?

57
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:06,769
It's on the hundred thieves, uh, YouTube channel. It was a fun time. You didn't answer one question.

58
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:16,899
Yes, I did. I answered like 10. There was like, it was a lot of questions going on.

59
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:30,399
You just lied the whole time. What? No, I didn't. What do you mean lied the whole time?

60
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:39,919
We were talking about our favorite foods and that like AI is, is getting really weird. Isn't it?

61
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:45,409
What do you mean lying and making up? What are you talking about? Do I like pappaginos?

62
00:08:45,409 --> 00:08:51,570
Pappaginos is the best chain pizza you could possibly eat. It is the best chain pizza

63
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:58,899
that is, that's available for you to eat. People are saying wrong. Stop it. I I'm telling you right

64
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:06,370
now, pappaginos versus something like Domino's, not even a contest. It's not even close. It's not

65
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:14,830
even fucking close. That piece of sucks. You are so wrong. I can't even believe it.

66
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:19,710
That's dog shit. That's a dog shit take. No, it is not. If those view that are telling me

67
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:24,909
that Domino's is better than pappaginos, one of two things is, is the problem. One,

68
00:09:24,909 --> 00:09:28,750
you've never eaten pappaginos because it's mostly a Northeast thing. So you,

69
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:32,350
you were just making it up. Oh, Domino's is better. I've never eaten the other one,

70
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:38,509
but that's fine. The second one is you got pappaginos before and it was at a party and

71
00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:43,870
there were 10 pizza boxes lined up in a row and you ended up getting in line to get your slice of

72
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:49,070
pizza an hour and a half after the pizza showed up. So you're like, oh yeah, there's pizza isn't

73
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:53,789
there. And you go in the back and there it is. Okay. There's like the line of pizzas, like six

74
00:09:53,789 --> 00:09:57,870
pizzas here. We're all like sharing it. I'm waiting. I've waited an hour to go get a slice.

75
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:08,139
You're going to give me that kind of review, play the game already, play the game. I'm gonna

76
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:16,929
play the game already. Change your pinned tweet. I can't, I can't. That means I have to log on to

77
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:24,059
Twitter. Well, actually I was on Twitter. I retweeted the 100 thieves thing. But anyways,

78
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:31,490
Domino's doesn't even stand a chance. I'm sorry. Pizza Hut, I will say, I don't know, I was stalling

79
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:36,769
for a minute because somebody angered me immensely in this chat by saying that pappaginos was a shitty

80
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:43,519
place. Pizza Hut, stuffed cross pepperoni pizza. You got me there. You do have me there.

81
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:50,159
Every single other item at Pizza Hut is awful. Pizza Hut, stuffed crust pepperoni pizza is

82
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:58,460
S plus. Every single other thing there is bad, but it's worth going there all the time because

83
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:05,549
they have that one item. I feel the same way about Taco Bell. The multi versus panel is still up.

84
00:11:05,549 --> 00:11:20,379
Oh, God damn it. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Give me a second. Is it really there? It is, isn't it?

85
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:40,769
It is. I'm removing it. I'm taking it off. There it goes. It was posting the link every 15 minutes

86
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:49,409
since that stream. What? I didn't turn it off. It was posting the link every 15 minutes since that

87
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:58,669
stream. What? Hold on. Wait a minute. You're telling me that whatever. It's fine. Hey, hey,

88
00:11:58,669 --> 00:12:02,269
Warner Brothers has been really good to me. So it's, I don't know. It's about it. I don't care.

89
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:08,379
That's fine. I don't care. Warner Brothers has been wonderful to me. That's fine.

90
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:14,059
All right. I'm done stalling. I've got my fucking Starbucks trying to give you some ideas. So where

91
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:18,700
you, you know, if you go fucking find something back like last year when I was like fucking talking

92
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,700
like this a lot and you can put it in the best overdone fucking Boston accent moment, this could

93
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,019
be one of them, except it's not because I'm going to, it's going to be deleted even if you nominate

94
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:32,529
it. Cause I was giving you an example. I'm looking, I actually am looking forward to that

95
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:40,779
category. I can't wait. I can't wait to see. All right, let's go. Yeah. There is worst stream.

96
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:54,460
You can nominate worst stream. Go ahead. Whatever it is. We'll see. We'll see if it wins. What's up?

97
00:12:54,460 --> 00:13:00,899
All right. So last thing. Oh, by the way, this was really funny. Actually. You see this up here. I,

98
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:04,820
I was like pissed off because I was like, why does it say that? Why is it doing this?

99
00:13:05,539 --> 00:13:12,159
It said, it said like itty bitty German nine eight five. I was like, why does it say that?

100
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:18,620
That's not cool. Why does it say that? I didn't know that they cycle through these

101
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:23,789
jokey things up here. I thought for some reason, I thought somebody was like fucking with me.

102
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:46,269
All right. The last thing we did is people were, I got to, I got to catch this. I got to catch this

103
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:51,710
because I believe we were in the middle of the party and I believe I was about to poison the cake

104
00:13:52,269 --> 00:14:03,549
which don't ask me why I was, people were saying like, Oh, poison. Hold on. All right. All right.

105
00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:09,139
No, no, no, no. All right. Put it away. I right when I put it away, put it away, put it away,

106
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:12,500
put it away, put it away, put it away. My birthday party can't be ruined yet. Put it away.

107
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:22,740
Why is it lagging so much? No, put it away. How do I put this away? I'm just going to delete it.

108
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:39,860
What is it? My computer's crashing. Why is my computer? It's my PC crashing. There we go. That

109
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:51,950
was weird. I don't want anybody to eat this. It's a 10,000. This is not a $10,000 PC. All right. So

110
00:14:51,950 --> 00:15:00,019
no, I don't want anybody to eat this dude. My computer does not like this game right now.

111
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:15,649
Why is it running so bad? All right. How do I hold on? I got to like,

112
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:22,129
I think my games like cash is messed up. Help me. This man wants to punch me and steal my money.

113
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:31,039
Where? Why is this running so bad? I'm not punching anybody.

114
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:39,100
Maybe. All right. I don't want anyone to eat the cake, but I'm going to blow the candles out.

115
00:15:39,100 --> 00:16:00,059
All right. It's time to celebrate. Nobody eat this. I just said I hated the organ.

116
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:17,059
You've ruined my birthday party. All right. Well, how do I blow out the candles? Stop, stop,

117
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:30,259
stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. All right. How do I fix this? Just take it out of his hand.

118
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:55,870
How do I fix this? Okay. We're good. Nobody can eat that cake. I don't want anyone to die right now.

119
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:09,250
No, no, no, no, no. Shit. How do I have, how do I get rid of this? Fence the cake in.

120
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:30,259
I just want to celebrate the birthday. I don't want anyone to eat it. Make a new cake.

121
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:38,509
How do I just get, how do I like do the thing? Blow out the candles. Where the,

122
00:17:38,509 --> 00:17:44,190
how come I can't blow the candles out? Go away from here. Go away. Don't eat this.

123
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,900
Whatever. I don't even care. I have to take it from him though,

124
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:57,009
because I need to finish the birthday party. I have to delete the cake. Okay.

125
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:24,130
All right. So I did it. Why can't I throw it away? Why can't I throw it away? I can't sell it.

126
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:34,960
I can't put it in my inventory and I can't sell it. There's no trash. Whoa. What are you doing?

127
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:45,410
What's the, isn't there a DJ supposed to be here? Don't touch this cake. Nobody touch this cake.

128
00:18:45,410 --> 00:19:18,430
No. Do I need a trash? Buy a trash. This is a laundry hamper. Okay. All right. I don't want

129
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:23,309
the party to end before the DJ gets here. That's incredibly important. All right. Throw it away.

130
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:35,359
What was that? All right. Throw it away. Throw it away. Imagine throw it away. Your birthday

131
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:57,089
cake. That's kind of, how do I fix this? Don't eat it. Don't eat it. She has to put it down

132
00:19:57,089 --> 00:20:04,619
somewhere. Don't eat it standing up. There's no room to sit down, but don't eat it. I thought

133
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:12,240
she's going to start taking bites out of it. Okay. Oh, wait, we have a compromise here.

134
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:18,779
That's been a compromise. Somebody take one. It's the every road led to this guy taking a piece.

135
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:42,079
Nobody got one, right? Get rid of this cake and make, make me a new one. I want just throw it away.

136
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:52,799
Okay. You need to stop doing that. All right. Everybody's safe. Leave one. What do you mean?

137
00:20:52,799 --> 00:21:08,849
I need somebody to make me a birthday cake. Who is that? Somebody make me a cake. Wait, what?

138
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:15,490
It's you? What? Wait, you're the, you are the caterer. You just haven't been making any food.

139
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:23,200
You've been dancing. They are the caterer. I just hired him again. Okay. Birthday. What?

140
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:41,809
What? Wait, did he eat a slice? No, he didn't eat a slice, right? Santa's just fuked. What?

141
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:53,839
Oh no. Why did he puke? What happened? I, he did not eat any cake. So what? I just don't get to

142
00:21:53,839 --> 00:22:04,339
have a birthday party anymore. What? He didn't eat any cake. Oh my God. That was crazy.

143
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:35,900
He just like fuked and died. I was so diligent though. I don't know what happened.

144
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:49,619
I didn't, there's a grilled cheese on this counter. It's like, dude, now is not the time

145
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:58,670
to make a grill. I'm trying. I want to make a birthday cake. Wait, can I, let's see if I can

146
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:10,059
bring him back. You're going to bring him back? While you literally just saved my life, words

147
00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:16,529
cannot begin to describe how grateful I am. I won't forget this. Well, he's still dead.

148
00:23:33,900 --> 00:24:15,730
Did they? I don't think that's accurate. Why is he still dead? They're a little late. Don't

149
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:29,380
get that close. When is it? Okay. Repair this. What? What do you mean? Why am I turning blue?

150
00:24:30,339 --> 00:24:37,569
What? How do I stop this? I need clothes. How do I put clothes on? How do I put clothes? I'll put

151
00:24:37,569 --> 00:24:57,470
some clothes on. What are you doing? Okay. There you go. What can? Oh, the caterer is back.

152
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:23,119
How are you? No, don't do that yet. I'm not ready. Can you make a cake? Can you finish this cake?

153
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:42,029
What are you doing? This scared the shit out of me. All right. Get up, get up, get up, get up.

154
00:25:42,029 --> 00:26:04,369
Are you going to do it? Actually, I need to blow up my birthday candles. Okay. Um,

155
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:19,759
interesting. I know I lean directly like that. All right. So let's just have a conversation for

156
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:31,779
a little bit. What's your likes and dislikes? It's annoying. Wait, she's flirty. What?

157
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:51,099
Following traits about hot headed. Okay. Um, should I have a single?

158
00:26:51,099 --> 00:27:22,269
Okay. Married to what? You're married? What is? Oh. What's going on here? You don't like bugs.

159
00:27:28,579 --> 00:27:37,170
Tell tales of galactic conquest. All right. Well, you want you looking for a funny conversation.

160
00:27:41,009 --> 00:27:45,569
Uh, let's do, I'll do an impression. That sounds good. Uh, I would not take your phone.

161
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:51,009
It's going to be ruined. Your phone is ruined. I don't know why you took it into the hot tub.

162
00:27:52,049 --> 00:28:04,819
That was really not a good idea. You can tell knock knock jokes. What do I do? I wait. Aren't

163
00:28:04,819 --> 00:28:33,390
you married? And they're going to ruin everything. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. I'll put

164
00:28:33,390 --> 00:29:00,269
your hand in that. Don't do that. Okay. Can somebody say something? Okay. What? Planning

165
00:29:00,269 --> 00:29:03,789
for retirement and midlife crisis away. It's the perfect time to start wrapping up those

166
00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:15,309
lifelong goals. Are you leaving? I didn't even bake my cake. What do I do with all this shit?

167
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:30,349
Do I have to sell this stuff? How do I just leave it here? Have you done any of your goals yet?

168
00:29:31,789 --> 00:29:39,329
We changed to rocket scientist. I'm getting close. I have to read three books in my whole life

169
00:29:39,329 --> 00:29:51,740
and that'll get there. You just an olive oil cake. I just, I need to blow my birthday candles out.

170
00:29:54,099 --> 00:30:00,819
Okay. There it is. Nice. Now add birthday candles. If no one's going to be here with me,

171
00:30:00,819 --> 00:30:28,430
I don't care. I'm doing it. You did it. What senior already wrinkled bellies party. Wait,

172
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:42,980
what happened? I got older. Wait, that's what happened. Okay. All right. Can I reverse that?

173
00:30:43,619 --> 00:30:50,059
How do I reverse that? I did it last time. I don't, I don't remember that happened the last time.

174
00:30:50,059 --> 00:30:55,339
Did it? I thought it was because the guy, I celebrated it. I didn't know if like blowing

175
00:30:55,339 --> 00:31:00,369
out the whatever. What are you doing over here? I don't care. What a sloppy fucking,

176
00:31:00,369 --> 00:31:10,930
actually that looks pretty good. Dude, you made, okay. That's very strange. This is not poisoned,

177
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:25,619
right? Am I old? I could just die at any minute now, right? Lord forgot to have a party for his

178
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:47,680
birthday. No, I didn't. I want to do that too. Why did I make a tomato sandwich? Why did I make

179
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:54,980
this? If I'm just put it away, put it in my inventory. I'll bring things home. These will

180
00:31:54,980 --> 00:32:03,069
be fine at the house. Oh, he never got the pizza. He wanted to order a pizza. All right. That was

181
00:32:03,069 --> 00:32:33,940
fun. Time to go home. But first let me go check this out. Wait, burn? Why can I burn these leaves?

182
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:44,460
That makes me happy. She's not going to light on fire, right? I thought he was afraid of fire.

183
00:32:48,289 --> 00:33:15,099
Play with? What do you mean play with? What am I doing? Why am I doing this?

184
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:46,099
You're feeding the fire. Why is she still doing this here? Let's get this shit out of me.

185
00:33:58,349 --> 00:34:04,910
I think we're all right. It's cold out. It's chilly. Yeah. Let's talk about the weather.

186
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:07,789
Uh, I got it. I got a cake over here.

187
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:24,449
All right. Well, I had apparently two birthdays. I, I'm not going back.

188
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:29,179
What? All right. I got to go home.

189
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:46,909
That was fun. Thanks everybody for coming to my double birthday work.

190
00:34:48,699 --> 00:35:18,300
Oh, wait, I stayed up all night. I don't want to leave this here. Oh, just go home.

191
00:35:24,769 --> 00:35:54,530
Oh, get off your phone. Just go home. Oh, going to work covered in, wait,

192
00:35:54,530 --> 00:36:12,050
GeekCon is in GeekCon is in town again, guys. Disgusting. Yeah. It's a trash plant.

193
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:21,469
It just started growing. So I just kept it. Your house sucks. Oh, you don't have to live in it.

194
00:36:21,469 --> 00:36:36,989
So why do you care? You're in the perfect state. No, I'm going to rest up. We're going to take care

195
00:36:36,989 --> 00:36:48,050
of the dog. How are you doing? Daily cap for a lifestyle. I don't even know what that means.

196
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:57,809
I got promoted. Look at, wait, I came into work. I shit my pants. I haven't showered in three days.

197
00:36:57,809 --> 00:37:07,679
I haven't slept and I got promoted. All right. There it is. Apprentice inventor. New clothes

198
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:17,139
and I can do journey to the stars. Why is this person dead? Congratulations on your recent

199
00:37:17,139 --> 00:37:28,159
birthday. Why is this person dead? What are you, what are you, what are you doing? What do you want?

200
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:35,199
Yeah. Can I help you? You, you're here to, you want to see the dog? Why did you just take a selfie

201
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:42,500
in my driveway? Um, hello. What do you want? You want to, you want to come take a picture with the

202
00:37:42,500 --> 00:38:11,949
dog? Wait, does this dog have a friend? So what, what can I do? How can I help you? Okay. I don't

203
00:38:11,949 --> 00:38:17,570
know why you're here. The dog has a better social life than you. Yeah. This is one of the dog's

204
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:26,050
friends. Okay. Well, we need to clean up a little. I'd never said invite in by the way. What if it's

205
00:38:26,050 --> 00:39:05,420
a vampire? Could be, could it be a vampire? I never invited this person in. Okay. You think

206
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:14,079
she's a vampire? I'm drinking a coffee at nine o'clock at night. I haven't slept in two or three

207
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:24,139
straight days. Why is this guy still going? All right. So this, this girl just came over the house

208
00:39:24,699 --> 00:39:33,469
to take a picture with the dog and then to use my computer. All right. There we go. Take a shower.

209
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:49,630
Take a thoughtful shower. Okay. Oh my God. This is taking a long time. All right. All right. This is,

210
00:39:49,630 --> 00:40:03,489
this, this is not a library. Okay. It's time for you to go. This is, this isn't a library. I'm sorry.

211
00:40:03,489 --> 00:40:16,829
Um, bribe for friendship. No, no. It's time for you to leave. Thanks for coming. Send home. Goodbye.

212
00:40:16,829 --> 00:40:46,260
Get out of here. What am I doing? Why did I wake up to do this? I'm just looking at the,

213
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:58,829
I'm looking at the Christmas decoration. All right. You leave the house. Get out. Why won't

214
00:40:58,829 --> 00:41:18,300
she leave? I should really get going. Yes. Get out of here. She's been living there.

215
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:32,579
What's the matter? What's wrong? You okay? Oh no. What's wrong? We need to go to the vet.

216
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:45,219
Everything all right? Where you going? Wanted to get some exercise. Oh, it's okay. I got a, um,

217
00:41:45,219 --> 00:42:05,900
decent bar. No, wake it up. Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up. No, no, no. Oh no. This is actually

218
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:20,929
sad. No, wait. How do I, can I, wait, pause it, pause it, pause it. Hold on a second. No, I wasn't,

219
00:42:20,929 --> 00:42:50,530
that wasn't, I wasn't ready. I was asleep. Save him. I can't, I can't save the game right now.

220
00:42:50,530 --> 00:43:04,960
No, it's okay. Okay. Everything's going to fall apart right now. Oh, he was a good dog.

221
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:12,699
Look at, look at, she was very happy at the end. That's all right. I'm not going to work today.

222
00:43:12,699 --> 00:43:41,309
Be serious. Do something. She lived a long life. We're going to put this somewhere. Nice. That's sad.

223
00:43:42,030 --> 00:44:01,630
Where should we put this? Here. Right here. I'm not, the bed's not going away. Reload? Um, I don't

224
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:17,579
think it matters if I reload because I've had, you're watching TV. What is this? Oh, it's the

225
00:44:17,659 --> 00:44:26,829
taco casserole I made. Bro's got to check on the Cowboys game. I'm going to, let's see if we can

226
00:44:26,829 --> 00:45:09,099
annoy death out of the house. No, turn this all off. I don't like this. Get rid of this. Adopt a

227
00:45:09,099 --> 00:45:38,659
cat or something. Ask for advice. Ask for advice about death. That makes sense. Flirty. It's going to

228
00:45:38,659 --> 00:46:11,090
work. We can't get a word in here. Okay. Gloomy compliment. This is death, right? This is right

229
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:29,389
up death. Oh, okay. Well, sad day, but I mean, look at, we're getting older too. Remember you

230
00:46:29,389 --> 00:46:49,619
can't flush the toilet. That's sad. Oh well. It's too bad. Oh no, the food bowl. You can use,

231
00:46:49,619 --> 00:47:13,789
go use the computer. There. Look, it's like nothing changed. See, you got your spot.

232
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:18,349
Pay your bills. Oh my God. Right. There's no electricity. I can't use the computer.

233
00:47:18,349 --> 00:47:33,949
How much are the bills? $584. What? All right. Can you turn my lights back on?

234
00:47:37,579 --> 00:47:44,820
Wait, is geek con right now? I'm not ready for geek con. No, I'm not. I'm not ready for geek con.

235
00:47:45,739 --> 00:47:49,900
It's, I mean, I guess I could take my mind off things, but I, should I go to geek con?

236
00:48:06,019 --> 00:48:13,940
Should I? All right. But this is not geek con. This is meet a celebrity. That's not,

237
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:26,690
when's geek con? Neighborhood brawl. We do it. We do a purge. I don't understand.

238
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:32,369
Neighborhood brawl? That's going to be fucking wild. Okay. Well, I need to make sure I have

239
00:48:32,369 --> 00:48:40,050
high bars for the neighborhood brawl. Why would we do this? Do that now? It's not until this weekend.

240
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:46,159
That's a very strange thing to be invited to. I feel like I'm going to get my ass kicked at this

241
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:55,869
event. I'm an old man. All right. No, we missed geek con. I think it was yesterday. I need to prepare

242
00:48:55,869 --> 00:49:02,750
for a harvest fest. Thanksgiving, right? All right. I need to prepare. Decorate. Brand meal.

243
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:11,119
I'm going to have a Thanksgiving party. So I need to decorate. Place holiday decorations from build

244
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:15,360
mode. Decorate the house exterior by placing and using the attic stack decoration box. How do I do

245
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:32,400
this? I need a, I only have 113 bucks. No, I'm keeping it. That was a stupid telescope. I said

246
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,880
it's, wait, I have bees. I forgot about the bees. I don't need to get rid of the telescope. I don't

247
00:49:36,880 --> 00:50:09,969
want it there. So you can see out the window. Okay. I need some harvest. What's it called?

248
00:50:10,769 --> 00:50:24,690
Harvest fest. What do I do this? Outdoor furniture. Outdoor activities. Which, what do I do?

249
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:48,030
Attic. What do I do that? Styled rooms. Where's attic? Search it. Attic stack decoration box. Oh,

250
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:54,110
okay. All right. So we need some, uh, some things to do here, which is, what do we got?

251
00:50:54,110 --> 00:51:08,079
Outdoor activities. Active. Oh, a, what does this have to do with Thanksgiving? A styling station?

252
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:35,710
The green one. Oh, and put this outside. Okay. So now I can, will they just be in here? Okay.

253
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:42,079
Select holiday decorations. Decorate freezies. Decorate foundation. Decorate. Should I just

254
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:51,699
put up everything? Decorate fences. Ooh, okay. This is harvest fest. Let's go with, um, something

255
00:51:51,699 --> 00:51:57,780
with the, something with the turkey on it. Oh, this is kind of, this is like whatever.

256
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:12,400
Do you not know where it is? All right, cool. Now let's do, um, foundation. I guess this.

257
00:52:15,809 --> 00:52:31,420
How's it look? Get it. What are you doing? You don't have to use the bathroom. And wait, am I

258
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:35,199
seeing things here? He doesn't have to use the bathroom. Why is he saying he has to use the

259
00:52:35,199 --> 00:53:03,329
bathroom? Foundation. Come on, do it. Dude, I don't have a foundation. I don't even know what

260
00:53:03,329 --> 00:53:10,429
this means. Why are these like weird, made up words? I don't even know what that means.

261
00:53:10,429 --> 00:53:20,050
Like decorate the outside, decorate the, the spandrels? The freezes? What is a freezes?

262
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:24,800
The spandrels. I feel like this is just made up words that I've never heard before.

263
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:43,550
Eaves? Roof? Siding? What is a spandrel? Just whatever. Just have the thing out the front.

264
00:53:44,269 --> 00:53:59,980
Just like sniff this. All right. I apparently I don't have any spandrels. What day is it? All

265
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:13,260
right. I have some decorations. I need a holiday gnome. Find gnomes around your lot. There's no

266
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:25,900
gnomes in my lot. Where there was a gnome. Okay. Well, I don't see any gnomes. Grand meal. A most

267
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:29,900
delectable feast awaits stomachs. Growling in anticipation. Make sure someone else

268
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:33,500
volunteers to do the dishes. Cook a grand meal. All right. So I need to hire somebody.

269
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:54,139
Let's have a party. I got money, right? Let's throw an event tomorrow. All right. Here we go.

270
00:54:55,260 --> 00:55:08,000
We are throwing a dinner party, right? Yep. Not, don't do it yet. Wait. Oh, wait. It's tomorrow.

271
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:14,619
Okay. What time is it right now? Just get my bars up. It's tomorrow. It's tomorrow. He's throwing.

272
00:55:14,619 --> 00:55:40,989
I didn't do anything. I backed out. Oh, this is sad. Mourn furry buddy. Oh yeah. Yodel died.

273
00:55:40,989 --> 00:56:00,539
Yodel died. Lived a good life though. Was very happy. Do you have mods? I do have mods. I have

274
00:56:00,539 --> 00:56:10,559
some crazy mods on. I'm just using them sparingly. Why are you not farting? I don't know. There hasn't

275
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:22,099
been a, there hasn't been a pants shit in at least, at least like 10 to 15 minutes of in-game. Oh,

276
00:56:22,099 --> 00:56:29,300
what's going on here? Losing control. Oh, it's all right. Put on the lullaby music. You'll be

277
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:51,329
all right. Take a nap. I don't, stop calling me to ask if you should hang out with somebody.

278
00:56:51,969 --> 00:57:04,059
You're the do or you don't. Cloud gaze with Jimmy Phipps. Okay. Well, we need to invite Jimmy Phipps

279
00:57:04,059 --> 00:57:33,679
to the Thanksgiving party tomorrow. All right. Take a nap. I go to bed, man. What are you doing?

280
00:57:33,679 --> 00:58:27,699
Now he wants retro music. Does this count? Okay. Um, how about you want to listen to music? Yeah.

281
00:58:27,699 --> 00:58:34,260
I'm listening to music. You'd be getting happier. Play a game. Play Sims forever. Just play a game.

282
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:44,289
I hate this guy so much. When he dies, please make someone who isn't explicitly dislikeable.

283
00:58:44,849 --> 00:58:57,329
You guys are rooting for this guy to die. Why are you guys rooting for this guy to die?

284
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:09,360
No, we're, look, we're going to geek con next year and we're going to go to space. What's wrong

285
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:21,119
with this guy? This guy sucks. He's fine. Make someone worse. It's fine. All right. It's about

286
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:26,590
eight o'clock. Turn this off. All right. Let's get ready for tomorrow. Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.

287
00:59:26,590 --> 00:59:29,469
We're going to have a big Thanksgiving party and I'm going to make sure there's a big

288
00:59:29,469 --> 00:59:40,420
turkey. That's enough of the computer. Get up please. Here's the bathroom. We've got a

289
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:50,530
breakthrough. That's exactly where I would have had one too. All right. Now we need to just take

290
00:59:50,530 --> 01:00:02,139
a quick shower. Quick shower. Then we need to eat and then I need to go to bed. So let's,

291
01:00:02,139 --> 01:00:16,579
what do we got? Oh wait, no, I have food in my pocket. Why does this guy have so much food?

292
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:22,769
Why does he have so much food in this? Why does he have an old coffee from like a year ago?

293
01:00:22,769 --> 01:00:33,840
I don't want to eat it. Is this cake fine? Why is the cake spoiled? Well, I'm asleep.

294
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:41,599
I made the cake two days ago. All right. We got to get rid of some of this stuff.

295
01:00:44,900 --> 01:01:10,510
Oh my goodness. Give it a, what do I give? What do I give? What do I give? How about a future cube?

296
01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:19,969
A pie. Probably a pie. Coffee? Pie? I think pie would be pretty good. Or a toy. Let me say pie.

297
01:01:19,969 --> 01:01:40,210
Okay. Where did I get this from? What just happened? What? Get this fucking thing out of my

298
01:01:40,210 --> 01:01:54,449
house. Get this thing out of my house. What? I just got struck by lighting. What just happened?

299
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:16,480
I'm not letting him out. I gave him an apple pie and he freaked out and turned off my speaker

300
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:21,699
and then struck me with lighting. What is going on with that? No, no, no, no. Oh no. This is bad.

301
01:02:21,699 --> 01:02:33,949
Okay. Um, you can see. Jeffrey Landgraab is available. How? Why is Jeffrey Landgraab the

302
01:02:37,920 --> 01:03:10,960
sing together with Jeffrey Landgraab? Where is he? I don't think he's coming.

303
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:22,320
All right. I got to clean that. Wait, appease the gnome. Um, I don't know. Toy. Give a toy.

304
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:46,780
Stop singing. Give a toy. Do you like? Okay. So you liked that. Okay. Cool. Everything is broken.

305
01:03:46,780 --> 01:04:02,139
Oh shit. All right. I got to get ready for my party. Hurry up. Come on. Good. Good. Good. Good.

306
01:04:02,139 --> 01:04:15,300
Trash. I need to just replace it. I don't care. Did you break it again? No. Uh, 700 bucks.

307
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:23,280
What am I making? Stop making BLTs. What the fuck? What is going on?

308
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:41,659
What's okay. Something weird is happening. Just eat your BLT and it's Thanksgiving. Hold on.

309
01:04:41,659 --> 01:05:02,190
I got to hire a repair person. Okay. Good. What is this now? All right. Thank you. Please come in

310
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:09,059
here and help me. I, okay. Let's, I got to invite people over now, right? Bladder, go to the bathroom

311
01:05:09,059 --> 01:05:18,239
and invite people over. We have to cook a grand meal. How much was that? A hundred bucks. All

312
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:26,460
right. That's not bad. All right. Clean up. Uh, eat that. And then I got good hygiene. I'm going

313
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:32,980
to take a shower and I'm going to invite everybody over for Thanksgiving. More gnomes. Yeah. They're

314
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:45,730
just everywhere. Polish this up. Quick shower. Let's go. Okay. Now I'm going to plan an event.

315
01:05:45,730 --> 01:05:55,659
I don't have a table. I had another breakthrough. I need a table. Okay. I did the gnome thing.

316
01:05:55,659 --> 01:06:01,809
Grand meal. Uh, okay. I need a table. Even if it's temporary. I'll sell it immediately after

317
01:06:01,809 --> 01:06:54,829
the party is over. Table. I don't want to table lamps. Okay. Let's invite some people over.

318
01:06:54,829 --> 01:07:04,019
Why are you going to bed? All right. It's 1 PM. We got to get this going. All right. Here we go.

319
01:07:04,019 --> 01:07:16,670
Everybody come hang out. It's time for a Thanksgiving dinner party. Let's go. All right.

320
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:23,579
And we're going to do it at my, at the McNulty residence. I'm going to be the host. We're going

321
01:07:23,579 --> 01:07:29,579
to invite of course, Jeffrey Landgraab. I wanted to do, I wanted to hang out with, uh, where is it?

322
01:07:29,579 --> 01:07:46,219
Jimmy? Um, what else do I really want here? I hate me. Santa, Santa's dead. You might, I don't know if

323
01:07:46,219 --> 01:07:53,630
you hear you. I don't know. All right. Caterer. No, the whole point is we're going to make the

324
01:07:53,630 --> 01:08:05,630
turkey. No, there's no caterer. No caterer. We're making the turkey. That's the whole point. We're

325
01:08:05,630 --> 01:08:16,779
going to make the food. What is this? Did I invite this person? Why are there random like

326
01:08:17,979 --> 01:08:29,890
packets on the ground? Come on in. Just throw your coffee on the ground at the beach.

327
01:08:29,890 --> 01:08:35,489
Come on. What the fuck is that? All right. Welcome everybody. We're going to cook a grand meal.

328
01:08:35,489 --> 01:08:51,390
Cook a grand meal. We're going to cook a turkey dinner. You guys ready? Come on. Let's go. We

329
01:08:51,390 --> 01:09:01,260
have to celebrate. Are we going to leave some presents for these gnomes or what? The very weird

330
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:18,210
turkey. This is a really boring party. We need some music or something. It's going to be like,

331
01:09:18,210 --> 01:09:36,819
hold on. Is there something fun we can do in here? Like activities or something fun or I don't know.

332
01:09:37,460 --> 01:10:09,020
How about a mega cooler? Bird feeder? Do a bonfire. Skeez. No, I don't think so. A bird feeder

333
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:14,779
party. I mean, we could just put like a bird feeder in here and just watch. Just open the

334
01:10:14,779 --> 01:10:34,510
wall of the doors and windows. Will this work? Can a bunch of birds get in the house? Does

335
01:10:34,510 --> 01:10:39,550
somebody want to help me cook? This is not Thanksgiving. There's like a bunch of people

336
01:10:39,550 --> 01:10:43,890
cooking. Everyone's like, is somebody bringing something? This is a dinner party. Why did they

337
01:10:43,890 --> 01:10:50,609
not bring anything? Oh, like Jeffrey's going to bring the casserole. You're going to bring

338
01:10:50,609 --> 01:10:55,180
the green beans. You're going to bring the mashed potatoes. It's a dinner party. Where's all the

339
01:10:55,180 --> 01:11:09,439
food? She farted and I left. Can we finish this? Nobody brought anything to the dinner party.

340
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:16,979
I mean, even a box of Pop Tarts or something. No one brought anything.

341
01:11:16,979 --> 01:11:26,640
And I'm just sad over here cooking the whole turkey dinner. Oh my God. I need to finish it.

342
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:30,479
Stop. We need to finish that. You have to be a good host.

343
01:11:43,779 --> 01:11:49,340
Everyone's just crowding over. Everyone's just watching this guy play League.

344
01:11:51,899 --> 01:11:56,180
They're just all hovering. Stop dancing and finish it.

345
01:11:56,579 --> 01:12:12,029
Can you finish the slop, please? Give yourself a pep talk.

346
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:25,390
Can somebody help me do this? Oh no, this person's coming in to give them some pep talk.

347
01:12:25,390 --> 01:12:50,850
I wonder what's going to happen. Finish it. Finish the turkey dinner. Stop getting distracted. It's

348
01:12:50,850 --> 01:13:06,590
just, I don't think he knows what he's doing. Can you move to UFC world or something? We don't

349
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:17,300
need you in the Sims world. What? You moved to UFC world? All right. Turkeys in the oven. Everybody

350
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:34,319
shut up. Oh, he's pissed because there's no food. Oh, we know he's helping. He's reading

351
01:13:34,319 --> 01:13:51,869
the instructions. Oh, okay. I get it. Looks good. Almost ready. Do we have any crab? No,

352
01:13:51,869 --> 01:13:57,229
we don't have any crab. We have a, we have like a 17 pound turkey in here. There's no crab.

353
01:14:01,039 --> 01:14:05,680
No, there's no seafood. Why do you think there's seafood here? Everyone is stuck. Get out of the

354
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:14,079
kitchen. Stop crowding me. There's no seafood. It's only turkey. Oh my, I'm going to punch

355
01:14:14,079 --> 01:14:17,840
somebody in the face in a second. Get away from me. Get away from me. That's why I can finish.

356
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:44,510
They're reading the ingredients. Stop. They're all back seating me. All right. I get, is it ready?

357
01:14:44,829 --> 01:15:00,399
Dude, the shit's in there right now. Serve it. Italian meatballs. Open the oven. What? Dude,

358
01:15:00,399 --> 01:15:07,069
people need to get away from me. Why am I making another dinner? Why am I making a second dinner?

359
01:15:08,189 --> 01:15:17,729
Am I making a side dish? Where's resume? Resume turkey dinner. Why are you cooking up

360
01:15:17,729 --> 01:15:24,579
watermelons? I don't understand what's happening right now. Why do I have watermelons on a plate

361
01:15:24,579 --> 01:15:40,239
here? What am I making? Why did he stop making the turkey? Okay. What are you going to do with that?

362
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:54,659
Right. Okay. And it's a fruit and yogurt parfait. Happy Thanksgiving. Are they all complaining?

363
01:15:54,659 --> 01:16:07,470
Okay. Good. Season it.

364
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:20,319
You would have started cooking this turkey like six hours ago. You wouldn't have started

365
01:16:20,319 --> 01:16:26,479
when people showed up. Oh, everybody enjoying the fruit and yogurt parfait. Eat up. Thanksgiving is

366
01:16:26,479 --> 01:16:39,699
here. Everybody come get a slice. Here it is. Happy Thanksgiving, everybody. Oh, hey, wait,

367
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:42,819
hey, make sure you leave a little bit of real estate. All right. There's still a little bit

368
01:16:42,819 --> 01:16:47,779
of real estate on that plate, right? Oh, come on. Yeah. You're going to pile that. You still got

369
01:16:47,779 --> 01:17:14,770
a little bit of real estate on there. Dude, do you want to go stargazing? You're all so annoying.

370
01:17:14,850 --> 01:17:26,750
Oh, thankful spirit. Discuss what you can be thankful for.

371
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:41,760
Let's complain about the local youth instead. Here's what I'm thankful for. These kids don't

372
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:47,680
even know how to throw footballs anymore. Oh, big bullshit. I could throw a perfect

373
01:17:47,680 --> 01:18:16,180
spiral when I was younger. Excuse me. What happened? Why am I a rejected gangster? I don't

374
01:18:16,180 --> 01:18:27,579
understand. Oh, my God, what a mess. Thank you for staying this whole time. Wait, be thankful.

375
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:49,439
What are you thankful for? Hector.

376
01:18:56,770 --> 01:19:04,619
What?

377
01:19:09,699 --> 01:19:23,250
They're our only friend. I'm not doing it. What? What the hell? You're a disgrace? What did I do?

378
01:19:23,250 --> 01:20:22,140
Dude, this is a vampire. 100%. 100%. This is a vampire. There's no way that's not a vampire.

379
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:31,789
There's no way that's not a vampire. Give me a break. All right. Invite in. Come on in.

380
01:20:31,789 --> 01:20:42,000
Come on in. I got me and my buddy Hector here. If you're getting thirsty. What? I'm going to

381
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:48,560
invite this person in and I'm going to leave. Oh, what? Who are you? Yes, of course. It's

382
01:20:48,560 --> 01:21:34,000
Thanksgiving. Come on in. Why did I punch this guy? Oh, this has to be a vampire. Lock the bathroom

383
01:21:34,000 --> 01:22:04,819
door.

384
01:22:12,029 --> 01:22:18,989
This is a vampire. Did you just show up late to the party?

385
01:22:27,619 --> 01:22:40,060
I didn't speed that up. I'm staying locked in. Oh, my God. I'm not going anywhere. I'm

386
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:49,579
staying locked in. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready though. I'm ready.

387
01:22:49,579 --> 01:23:24,340
What did he just do? He just like, what did he just do to him? He just like did like a move at him.

388
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:43,649
What did he do? He just like held the change up to him and changed his channel. Wait,

389
01:23:43,649 --> 01:24:00,829
do you live there? Wait, OK, I can leave now. OK, stop doing this. What a mess. Put it away.

390
01:24:00,829 --> 01:24:10,420
I'm going to eat turkey dinner for like the next six months. Turn this off. What an absolute mess.

391
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:26,880
I'm going to put this outside. We put it right here so we can see the birds. OK, what a mess.

392
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:35,899
There's some bird seed in there. How come you're still here? That's what I'm going to take. I have

393
01:24:35,899 --> 01:24:57,939
a gnome in my inventory. OK, I'm never taking him out. OK, birds are coming in. How do I get

394
01:24:57,939 --> 01:25:19,729
them to leave? OK, this is such a mess. Wait, this is still all right. Put that away. I get to clean

395
01:25:19,729 --> 01:25:25,199
up. Harvest Fest was awesome. Blorek had a wonderful time and got to do everything he planned to do.

396
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:30,510
Nice. All right, we did it. Pease the gnome. No, I'm not doing anything. When I wake up,

397
01:25:30,510 --> 01:25:49,520
I'll clean up. I'm not doing anything. What am I saying? I'm going to sell the gnome.

398
01:25:50,479 --> 01:26:05,380
Holy shit. OK, that's 300 bucks. What other shit can I sell? Journey to the Stars. Unlocked at level

399
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:24,819
two and a cheese pizza. Where is this? Let me sell the other gnome that's in my actual inventory here.

400
01:26:25,539 --> 01:26:45,619
I could sell all kinds of stuff now. This thing's rare. I love presents. I don't need that anymore.

401
01:26:45,619 --> 01:26:55,420
Message in a bottle. Oh, gems? No, those are my Kyber crystals. Why do I have a bunch of people's

402
01:26:55,420 --> 01:27:14,270
earns? OK, I got some money. When's the community brawl? Tomorrow. OK, tonight is the talent

403
01:27:14,270 --> 01:27:26,460
showcase. I'm not going to work. Wait, I have to go to work, don't I? Just go to work. Whatever.

404
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:51,939
Oh, boy. Jesus. OK, this house is disgusting. Just retire on your phone. But I want to be a

405
01:27:51,939 --> 01:28:06,560
rocket scientist. I'm not ready. I'm not done yet. Spice festivals in town. Spicy challenge.

406
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:17,619
All right, so this is going on. There's also a talent show tonight, too. The festival of

407
01:28:17,619 --> 01:28:26,829
light has started. There's all kinds of stuff going on tonight. I have to jump around. Jesus.

408
01:28:26,829 --> 01:28:36,180
I hear the festival t-shirts are out of this world. Let's go to the festival and buy one.

409
01:28:43,390 --> 01:28:56,270
I'm not ready. I got to get a cold shower going here. I need to clean up. I'm not ready. It's 7

410
01:28:56,270 --> 01:29:01,710
p.m. I got to do something, though. Whatever. I'll clean this up later. I got to go. There's

411
01:29:01,710 --> 01:29:06,430
a bunch of social events going on right now. I have to do it. I'm going to do the talent show.

412
01:29:07,069 --> 01:29:11,550
I got to hurry up. Talent show is going on right now. We're going to go talent show.

413
01:29:11,550 --> 01:29:19,149
I'm going to go do the spicy festival. Let's go. No one. No, I'm going alone.

414
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:50,460
I want to do the talent show. Am I going? All right. Talent show. What do I have for skills?

415
01:29:50,460 --> 01:30:02,829
There's so much going on in this game. It's crazy. Crazy frogs Twitter. What's happening on crazy

416
01:30:02,829 --> 01:30:30,350
frog Twitter? I mean, look at it. Why? OK, I have not saved the game since we started. All right.

417
01:30:30,350 --> 01:30:40,140
So talent show time. Sign up at the bar to participate with the thunderstorm. All right.

418
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:55,060
Sign up at the bar. It's time for the talent showcase. Join open mic. Couldn't we have done

419
01:30:55,060 --> 01:31:03,489
this out indoors? Why are we outside doing this? I would not be in the pool right now.

420
01:31:03,489 --> 01:31:08,239
I've been signed up for the talent showcase. Use the mic or instrument once it's time

421
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:18,430
to get on stage. OK, what's going on right now? Why is there everybody scared of the toilet?

422
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:36,770
All right. When did we start the talent show? This person should not be in the pool right now.

423
01:31:36,770 --> 01:31:51,810
Should I go first? Oh, wait. OK. All right. Let's watch. I can't even hear what they're saying.

424
01:32:17,119 --> 01:32:29,630
OK, now it's my turn to perform. OK. Should I hire a comedian? Practice acting. It's my turn.

425
01:32:29,630 --> 01:32:42,319
Get off the stage. It's my turn. Get off the stage. Get off the stage. It's my turn, they said.

426
01:32:44,989 --> 01:33:10,300
Get out of the way. It's my turn. They just called my name. Here we go. I got nervous.

427
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:34,529
This is quite the awful talent show. No one's doing anything. Oh, my God.

428
01:33:44,340 --> 01:34:01,060
Stop looking at the toilet and get over here. Your name has been called. Practice acting already.

429
01:34:03,170 --> 01:34:16,579
Do a talent. Play the guitar. Pick up the guitar and care. Oh, do it. No, you're not on stage yet.

430
01:34:16,579 --> 01:34:54,960
You need to be up there before you do overdrive. Having a bad time. Literally nobody did anything.

431
01:35:00,899 --> 01:35:16,060
Who am I calling? Someone's going to die. That's a vampire. Wait, that's the vampire that came to the

432
01:35:16,060 --> 01:35:41,840
house. Take a pretzel. Yeah, nice. What time is it? I missed the spicy festival for this

433
01:35:41,840 --> 01:36:01,680
bullshit. Everybody was too scared to use it. OK, here we go. Here's somebody. Talent show's over,

434
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:25,460
man. Let's just talk. This person's going to get struck by lightning and they're going to get

435
01:36:25,460 --> 01:36:29,060
struck by lightning. They're standing really still. They're going to get struck by lightning.

436
01:36:29,060 --> 01:36:41,420
It's going to hit this person. It's going to hit this lady right now. Someone's getting

437
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:52,939
struck by lightning. I'm telling you. Do karaoke. This guy sucks. I can't. I don't like the fact

438
01:36:52,939 --> 01:36:58,859
that there's a thunderstorm so I won't do it. Wait, what is wrong? Having a really bad time.

439
01:37:01,380 --> 01:37:24,659
Am I actually going to order? Why am I having such a bad time? What's fun?

440
01:37:26,270 --> 01:37:51,920
Fortnite? Why am I having such a bad time? Is there anything I can do here that's going to make me

441
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:59,409
have fun? Anything. Anything at all. I mean, I'm listening to talk radio apparently. I

442
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:12,750
thought there was blood all over her hands. Having any fun. Do anything. Is there like a TV

443
01:38:12,750 --> 01:38:51,359
I can turn on? This guy needs to shut up. This is not fun. Shut up. Shut up. Seriously, shut up.

444
01:38:57,039 --> 01:38:58,720
I'm just going to steal money out of his pocket.

445
01:39:12,529 --> 01:39:14,130
Oh my god. That guy had a lot of money.

446
01:39:21,199 --> 01:39:33,470
He won't stop. He won't stop. What the fuck?

447
01:39:42,029 --> 01:39:45,069
Okay. All right. All right. Watch karaoke. That's fun.

448
01:39:52,260 --> 01:40:01,659
Wow. Why? Why am I a heckler? I'm heckling. I shouldn't be heckling. Why am I heckling?

449
01:40:01,659 --> 01:40:16,779
Why am I having such a bad time? This is unbearable. Why am I, why am I heckling somebody

450
01:40:16,779 --> 01:40:59,789
at karaoke? Can I scare this person? Shut up. How do I stop you from doing this? Stop talking. Stop it.

451
01:40:59,789 --> 01:41:10,060
Okay. Good. It's only so long you can take somebody going

452
01:41:13,260 --> 01:41:38,260
It's like, holy goodness, man. Holy shit. I actually like this guy.

453
01:41:50,930 --> 01:41:55,949
Where is he? Why can I not pick him? He's not leaving, right? Let's do a duet with the Banthar.

454
01:42:17,060 --> 01:42:25,789
Nooboo, Kalka, Flair, Boo, Oopsa, Blard, Isni, Bavoy,

01:42:29,810 --> 01:42:35,489
Brunchy, Oopsa, Blard, Simba, Boo, Sue, Isni, Bavoy,

458
01:42:50,449 --> 01:42:51,970
This is going to be so uncalled for.

459
01:43:08,460 --> 01:43:09,180
All right, I won't.

460
01:43:13,010 --> 01:43:30,159
I'm just going to turn and like punch him in the stomach. It's still kids music playing. All right,

461
01:43:30,159 --> 01:43:38,189
that was fun. It's time to prepare for the neighborhood brawl. It's time to prepare.

462
01:43:38,189 --> 01:43:45,810
This is going to be nuts. You guys think that this is something I'm making up?

463
01:43:45,810 --> 01:43:55,699
It's today. It's between six a.m. and two a.m. Neighborhood brawl. I don't know what that means,

464
01:43:55,699 --> 01:44:20,420
but I know it's today. It's all fucking day. It's yeah, it's from six to two. I got to be prepared.

465
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:28,020
I need to sleep. Neighborhood brawl begins in neighborhood brawl begins in 30 seconds.

466
01:44:29,119 --> 01:44:40,479
Hmm. Neighborhood brawl begins in 10 seconds. Here we go.

467
01:44:46,109 --> 01:45:04,930
Fight. Today is all about starting fights with other Sims. Pretty quiet out here. A whole lot

468
01:45:04,930 --> 01:45:43,500
going on. Hmm. Who's going to make the first move? Interesting. Anybody shows up at my house,

469
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:54,659
they get punched in the face. I know what today is. We're just going to show up at the door though.

470
01:45:54,659 --> 01:46:01,489
Oh, it's a big guy. I brought a casserole. Oh, you did? You brought a casserole to the house?

471
01:46:01,489 --> 01:46:10,340
Yeah, right. Definitely like a knife in your back pocket. I know what today is. Get ready.

472
01:46:10,340 --> 01:46:29,680
That's so expensive or whatever. All right. Eat something. Have some leftover turkey. Okay.

473
01:46:32,109 --> 01:46:43,119
Look, I'm in top shape right now. Let's brush our teeth and let's get to it. I need a much

474
01:46:43,119 --> 01:47:04,050
better outfit for this. Change outfit. I think that looks pretty good. Okay. I think it's perfect.

475
01:47:10,029 --> 01:47:34,640
I'm going to call a cleaning service here. All right. What are you doing over here?

476
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:46,699
All right. I need just a one-time maid. Okay. Here we go. Where am I going? Should I just wait

477
01:47:46,699 --> 01:48:15,949
until somebody comes to the house? Where should I go? I'm going to go. Where do I go? All right.

478
01:48:15,949 --> 01:48:30,079
It's neighborhood brawl time. The bar? Spa? Should I just walk around the neighborhood?

479
01:48:30,079 --> 01:48:44,770
Just be like, yeah, I'm ready. Just like scream in the street. Click the event. What do you mean?

480
01:48:44,770 --> 01:48:51,229
I think it's just, yeah, I think I just have to do it because like there's nothing to click on.

481
01:48:51,229 --> 01:48:58,210
Unless I go in here, you mean? Yeah. It's just, it's not, it's just, just fight somebody. That's

482
01:48:58,210 --> 01:49:03,039
going to find somebody to fight. All right. So I'm just going to go to like the, I'll go to like the

485
01:49:17,170 --> 01:49:24,420
invite a bunch of people over? Hey, I'm having a, I'm having a TV watch party for Game of Thrones.

486
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:50,590
Everybody come over. Costume party. All right. I'm throwing a costume party. That sounds good.

487
01:49:50,590 --> 01:50:21,710
I'm the host and we're inviting everybody. Right. Should there be a caterer? No, there's no caterer.

488
01:50:21,710 --> 01:50:43,010
No, we don't have a mixologist, but we could go back to the ruins, right? Island Bluff. We could

489
01:50:43,010 --> 01:50:58,500
go back to the ruins and we could, but people could bowl and stuff. Hire a bunch of services.

490
01:50:58,500 --> 01:51:12,720
I think I just wanted it at the house. Okay. Island Bluff. Okay. This is like an open area.

491
01:51:12,720 --> 01:51:23,329
So I should hire some services. Okay. Island Bluff. Just an open area for us. Cause we all know

492
01:51:23,329 --> 01:51:39,890

493
01:51:39,890 --> 01:51:50,050
Why am I, I'm in a pizza delivery costume. This person's a, wait is that, no, why?

494
01:51:50,050 --> 01:52:16,699
Does this person even have a costume? Holy shit. We're going to go over here. Everybody follow me.

495
01:52:16,699 --> 01:52:29,340
What? Okay. I thought I was going to go. How come nobody's fighting? Why does my piece stink

496
01:52:29,340 --> 01:53:12,260
so bad? Uh oh. Why is nobody fighting? It's a neighborhood brawl. Complain about the

497
01:53:12,260 --> 01:53:22,399
neighborhood brawl. All right. What do you got? Let's go. The first punch has been thrown. Good

499
01:53:53,979 --> 01:54:22,460
everybody, ever it's a surprise. It's a neighborhood brawl. Why am I the only person fighting? Wait,

500
01:54:22,460 --> 01:54:29,890
did I just not get it? Oh, it's a neighborhood brawl. I just don't get it. It's a fun costume

501
01:54:29,890 --> 01:54:37,939
party. I just didn't get it. Wait a minute. Why did I just puke? Why did I just puke?

502
01:54:38,659 --> 01:55:06,880
Why did I just puke? I don't know. Everybody hates me. Somebody's stopping me. Why is

503
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:40,050
nobody stopping me? Stop me. You're a disgrace. Oh, here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.

504
01:55:44,539 --> 01:56:12,220
I win. He punched this guy in the stomach. Does anyone know why I puked?

505
01:56:16,819 --> 01:56:25,010
Don't come near me, violent scum.

506
01:56:29,489 --> 01:56:38,479
Can you move? Why is nobody else fighting?

507
01:56:50,689 --> 01:56:58,670
What was that? What the fuck? What happened? Somebody just throw something at me?

508
01:56:59,710 --> 01:57:07,100
Wait, why are they all freaking out about her? Everyone turned to her now.

509
01:57:07,100 --> 01:57:08,220
Something wrong? What happened?

510
01:57:24,220 --> 01:57:39,869
Let's share the neighborhood brawl spirit. You ain't shit. Okay. All right. Hey, be careful.

511
01:57:40,189 --> 01:57:53,859
We're gonna eat that grilled cheese that fast. Oh, wait, what? What's happening? What? No,

512
01:57:53,859 --> 01:58:02,210
I thought they were gonna eat a grilled cheese and choke on it. I didn't click on. What? No,

513
01:58:02,210 --> 01:58:05,810
I thought I was trying to click the hot dog. I thought he was gonna eat a grilled cheese and

514
01:58:05,810 --> 01:58:22,579
choke. I did. Didn't I click this other person? What the fuck?

515
01:58:43,329 --> 01:58:46,369
Do you see? Can you stop? Catch me outside.

516
01:58:52,270 --> 01:58:55,229
Dude, it's neighborhood brawl and nobody's fighting.

517
01:58:56,819 --> 01:59:07,420
No one else's neighborhood brawled. Catch me outside. It's time for you to suffer. What?

518
01:59:08,140 --> 01:59:18,380
I'm sorry, but when you give me this option here that's neighborhood brawl,

519
01:59:19,020 --> 01:59:29,439
how come nobody's... I go into the gym. I had to turn off the Fortnite shit. Is that death?

520
01:59:42,960 --> 02:00:16,420
Oh, what else can I even do? I don't want to like hit me. I don't want to hurt anybody. I did.

521
02:00:16,420 --> 02:00:22,850
Apparently, I still... I was never supposed to do this in the first place because it's too old.

522
02:00:22,850 --> 02:01:23,039
I'm too old. Whoa. Whoa. What? I'm arrested? How long am I in jail for? Winter. Nobody's clicked

523
02:01:23,039 --> 02:01:40,130
this. Broke out of jail. That's not what I wanted to do. My God, dude. How does that happen? I don't

524
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:56,340
know. Just go home. Just go home at this point. What the hell am I going to do now? Okay. Prison

525
02:01:56,340 --> 02:02:31,229
break. That's what? So what now? What? By the way, the maid didn't even come and I paid for it.

526
02:02:31,229 --> 02:03:03,739
Oh, nevermind. You ain't shit. Birds. It's a cardinal. Cool. Okay. So what's coming up next?

527
02:03:05,699 --> 02:03:19,949
Oh, Winterfest is back. Starlight accolades. What does that mean? I don't know what that is.

528
02:03:19,949 --> 02:03:31,100
All right. I actually really do need to clean. Ridiculous. Take these decorations down. It's

529
02:03:31,100 --> 02:03:56,100
over. We're in winter. So how's my career doing? I did four breakthroughs. Okay. As of tomorrow,

530
02:03:56,100 --> 02:04:03,939
I think I'll be all right. Yeah. Yodel died. Yeah. A couple hours ago. Do life goals, not dreams.

531
02:04:03,939 --> 02:04:16,609
Okay. I need a logic. Finished reading three books. Just read a logic book. I think I have

532
02:04:16,609 --> 02:04:29,470
to buy a book, right? I need logic. Logic two, right? Logic volume two. Let's go ahead and read

533
02:04:29,470 --> 02:04:49,390
that. I'll read logic volume two. Pretty sick. Need to read a couple books. Is that working?

534
02:04:52,369 --> 02:05:17,979
Oh, I don't care. Why won't I finish the book? I need volume three. What? Are you serious? 250

535
02:05:17,979 --> 02:05:39,460
bucks. Are you kidding me? Why not? Why? Because I punched the, punched that guy in the stomach.

536
02:05:39,460 --> 02:05:49,470
Why can't I read this? And I had, there's somebody coming. Can I cancel the maid service?

537
02:05:49,470 --> 02:06:07,710
Because I'm just cleaning up the house. I need volume one. What is this? The festival of youth.

538
02:06:07,710 --> 02:06:31,779
Ice cream crepes. Blessings and a void critter hunt. This is cool. It's Pokemon Go. You're too

539
02:06:31,779 --> 02:06:45,659
old. I think I am too old. I'm too old. I am not going to that. I'm not going to that. I'm sorry.

540
02:06:45,659 --> 02:06:57,899
I just, I don't think, I don't think I can go there. All right. I'm getting rid of this. This

541
02:06:57,899 --> 02:07:05,630
is just bringing the mood down. Well, good thing I did that and I just paid a service to come and

542
02:07:05,630 --> 02:07:16,850
clean the house and they're not going to do anything tomorrow. I have to go to work tomorrow

543
02:07:16,850 --> 02:07:22,050
anyways. We have to do aspirations. I'm not fucking around. I need to finish reading three books. Does

544
02:07:22,050 --> 02:07:40,750
it matter what the book is? How about Crisis Barn? Does the book matter? Yeah, you get it.

545
02:07:40,750 --> 02:07:54,430
You get it. I need two more books. Have a child. I'm, guys, I'm like 80. I'm like 85. I have a

546
02:07:54,430 --> 02:08:11,329
child. What? It's for a different sim. All right. I finished that book. What time is work tomorrow?

547
02:08:11,329 --> 02:08:18,720
All right. So I got time. I'll get promoted. Adopt, adopt, adopt, adopt. What? No, I'm not going to

548
02:08:18,720 --> 02:08:35,260
adopt a kid and die. Buy a youth potion. What else am I doing? All right. I need some food.

549
02:08:35,899 --> 02:08:47,920
I got to get promoted. Check your rewards. I need to own a business too. How do I buy a business?

550
02:08:52,270 --> 02:09:11,460
Flirty potion. Happy potion. Um, where is it? Speed cleaner. Storm. Wait, potion of youth.

551
02:09:12,020 --> 02:09:20,060
Drink this to turn back the clock on your sim's current age. Should I drink one of these?

552
02:09:20,060 --> 02:09:26,180
Oh, I feel like that's going against the natural order here. Do it. No, let him die. Isn't this,

553
02:09:26,180 --> 02:09:34,579
this is going against the natural order, I think. Do a poll. All right, let's do a poll.

554
02:09:36,060 --> 02:09:42,140
Do you want me to keep Blorg McNulty around or do you want Blorg, well, let's get this cleared up

555
02:09:42,140 --> 02:09:53,760
here. Do you want Blorg McNulty to drink the potion of youth? Get a poll up. Yes or no. What

556
02:09:53,760 --> 02:10:08,819
are you thinking? How do you feel? What do you think? No. I'm seeing a lot of no's. There is a

557
02:10:08,819 --> 02:10:20,109
lot of no's coming out right now. There's a lot of yeses too though. That's a lot. You guys want this

558
02:10:20,109 --> 02:10:34,850
guy to fuck off so bad? That's the 75% almost. Dad, we're not doing that. Thanks for voting

559
02:10:34,850 --> 02:10:39,890
those of you that voted. Um, no, we're not. Should I buy something else though?

560
02:10:50,020 --> 02:11:08,579
Instant fun. Eh. Eh. All right, I need to read another book. Where am I? I'm gonna need logic

561
02:11:08,579 --> 02:11:20,430
to go up. Get a cat. We'll see. Let me get my work stuff done. This will be the third book

562
02:11:20,430 --> 02:11:42,100
and then I can do logic. Where's the dog? Sorry. Get a hamster. There it is.

563
02:11:42,739 --> 02:11:50,560
All right, now I need one more logic skill and I have an aspiration here. What's up?

564
02:12:24,300 --> 02:12:26,460
I'm gonna give you a funny gift.

565
02:12:32,300 --> 02:12:44,899
What is it? Oh, it's just a joke. By the way, if you imagine going over to somebody's house

566
02:12:44,899 --> 02:12:53,489
and they come to greet you with a plate of Thanksgiving dinner and it's January or it's

567
02:12:53,489 --> 02:13:00,659
like late December. I don't know if that stuff's still good. We're getting into, it's been like

568
02:13:00,659 --> 02:13:06,100
two or three weeks. I don't know if you still should be eating Thanksgiving dinner every day.

569
02:13:09,659 --> 02:13:10,220
Can I get you some?

570
02:13:16,029 --> 02:13:17,390
No, I could do fucking garlic noodles.

571
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:41,279
All right, I need to get out of here. What book do I get for logic? I'm just gonna get the

572
02:13:41,279 --> 02:13:51,899
chess table, right? Oh, there's honey in here. How much did I get for this? Are they even still

573
02:13:51,899 --> 02:14:14,609
here? Jesus, a hundred bucks. What was that? What was that for?

574
02:14:21,409 --> 02:14:31,300
I'm gonna bond with the bees. This is like so scary. This is a weird guy.

575
02:14:44,399 --> 02:14:51,760
Oh, I'm like computers.

576
02:14:55,060 --> 02:15:00,100
Okay, that can't make the bees do anything.

577
02:15:00,100 --> 02:15:45,380
I need to go to bed. Thanks for going. Why does everybody use my computer? They come over and use

578
02:15:45,380 --> 02:16:03,520
the computer and they sit here all night. I thought she got in the bed. Okay, so what's

579
02:16:03,520 --> 02:16:10,979
coming up here? I want to make sure that I have 10 hours. I can't get logic in 10 hours. I might

580
02:16:10,979 --> 02:16:18,850
get promoted though because I'm doing all right. I need to be focused. How do I get focused?

581
02:16:18,850 --> 02:16:37,069
Programming or something, right? Like write research. Okay, that should do pretty good.

582
02:16:37,069 --> 02:16:59,620
I'm focused? No. Ghost? What? What do you mean ghost? Where? No, no, no, no. Oh, shit. I missed her.

583
02:16:59,700 --> 02:17:28,030
It's okay. Check inventory for logic. I have volume two. What's the difference between volume

584
02:17:28,030 --> 02:17:33,059
one, volume two, and volume three? Should I read this? I think I already did this though, didn't I?

585
02:17:33,059 --> 02:17:49,010
Oh, wait. No, it's working. I'm just gonna make sure I get the point and then I'm not gonna get

586
02:17:49,010 --> 02:18:04,100
it in time. That's fine. Eat some of the turkey dinner. Who are you talking to eat? All right,

587
02:18:04,100 --> 02:18:18,270
I'm in a pretty good mood. I think I'll be all right. All right, go to work. Now get out of the

588
02:18:18,270 --> 02:18:33,840
chat room. Go to work. Out of the chat room. No more chatting. All right, go. Oh, wait, this is

589
02:18:33,840 --> 02:18:58,819
the cleaning service. Okay. What day is it? How much was this? That was 55 dollars. Wait, I just

590
02:18:58,819 --> 02:19:14,459
picked just two plates and it was 55 bucks. Shit, it's all right. I'll be back from work in a minute.

591
02:19:14,459 --> 02:19:30,579
How long am I at work for? It's too long. What's up? Bills have been delivered. Okay, I should be

592
02:19:30,579 --> 02:19:37,219
able to buy it. I couldn't reach your mailbox but I managed to throw the mail in there. Good luck

593
02:19:37,219 --> 02:19:55,840
getting it out. What? Somebody in the bin? What do you mean? Somebody in the bin. What do you mean?

594
02:19:55,840 --> 02:20:02,059
Somebody's in the bin. Oh, you're talking about. No, that's the bees are sleeping right now.

595
02:20:02,059 --> 02:20:08,500
That is kind of funny. It does look like somebody's just in the box. All right, keep going.

596
02:20:12,639 --> 02:20:33,620
I want to visit werewolf world. No, I want to go to werewolf world. Let's go light fireworks.

597
02:20:35,920 --> 02:20:43,549
But I'm too tired. What was in the mailbox? Was it like a screwdriver? What was that?

598
02:20:44,819 --> 02:20:49,620
All right. Okay. All right. All right. Fine. Fine. Fine. Let's go. All right. Let's go. Let's go.

599
02:20:49,620 --> 02:21:05,569
Let's go. We just light some fireworks and it's the humor festival. That's fine. I will see. I'll

600
02:21:05,569 --> 02:21:27,090
see where I can't. It's a hard word to say. Where were you? Okay. I thought this was a

601
02:21:27,090 --> 02:22:03,250
humor festival. Why are we at like an art gallery? Where are we going? Where am I going? What? What

602
02:22:03,250 --> 02:22:36,590
was that? What did I just take? I don't have anything. I don't get it. I didn't take anything.

603
02:22:36,590 --> 02:22:41,979
That's weird. All right. So we're here. Uh, let's why don't we we're supposed to be doing

604
02:22:41,979 --> 02:22:54,110
like humor and hijinks. Why don't we come over here? Okay. All right. I'm going to join the

605
02:22:54,110 --> 02:23:03,819
pranksters. Worst party ever. Well, you went into the art gallery. You didn't even go to the party.

606
02:23:04,620 --> 02:23:30,239
Now I got to light fireworks. We can spray graffiti. Did you even join? Join the pranksters.

607
02:23:30,799 --> 02:23:58,129
All right. We're going to do some graffiti. This is going to take the entire evening.

608
02:23:58,129 --> 02:24:33,379
What does it say? We're like, we're like choking. You're going to help. I feel like 10 people

609
02:24:33,379 --> 02:24:50,450
should be doing this. I need to finish this. I can't, I can't just do it halfway. Right. We've

610
02:24:50,450 --> 02:25:10,590
got to go watch fireworks. Cool. I got to finish this whole thing. This guy's fucking crazy.

611
02:25:12,479 --> 02:25:20,590
Okay. So it's not done. It's one o'clock in the morning, dude. The only people that are still

612
02:25:20,750 --> 02:26:13,659
employees. It's not even close. Do I get anything for this? Painting level three. Wow. Almost done.

613
02:26:13,659 --> 02:26:36,159
Under like 34 hours and should be done. I think it's good. This person walking around with a knife.

614
02:26:36,159 --> 02:27:08,860
Finish the painting. Look who it is. Almost done. It's almost done. It's not time for bed.

615
02:27:11,469 --> 02:27:40,860
Mural art style graffiti. What do you think? What do you think? What do you think? What's so funny?

616
02:28:02,479 --> 02:28:38,020
You like it? Okay. I just made it darker. Order food. I was defacing my own graffiti.

617
02:28:38,020 --> 02:29:02,260
Is anybody going to help me? Oh, the clap woke me up. Okay. Cool. Well, I was that really,

618
02:29:02,260 --> 02:29:09,889
I guess, I guess it's cool. Yeah. It's, it's there. I did that. All right. I made it. What do we got?

619
02:29:09,889 --> 02:29:16,500
I'll take some, um, what do we, what am I ordering? What? Whoa. You ain't shit.

620
02:29:17,760 --> 02:29:34,909
I bought that. Give me those two sausages. I, I bought that. Wait, where am I?

621
02:29:36,590 --> 02:29:40,350
Did I steal it? No. Okay. I took it from behind the counter.

622
02:29:42,270 --> 02:29:48,479
You hate shit. What'd you get?

623
02:29:48,479 --> 02:30:16,909
What's your food? You don't want it?

624
02:30:25,469 --> 02:30:31,469
Whoa. What's wrong? What?

625
02:30:44,739 --> 02:30:48,979
No, I'm not going to, no, I'm not. I already have a really terrible reputation. I'm not doing that.

626
02:30:48,979 --> 02:30:51,840
Our reputation is so, why did they close the stores for five minutes?

627
02:30:52,479 --> 02:31:07,969
All right. What's this spicy food? All right. Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up. I gotta go home.

628
02:31:09,170 --> 02:31:21,620
Get up. Get up. Wake up. New Year's Eve is tomorrow. I gotta be ready.

629
02:31:26,670 --> 02:31:33,840
I'm going to werewolf world for New Year's Eve. By the way, I'm just like quitting my job.

630
02:31:33,840 --> 02:31:50,370
What? I'm retiring. Where is it? Business, right? I'm retired. There it is. Where the hell am I?

631
02:31:53,100 --> 02:31:59,659
No one plays the holiday events. You know that, right? I want to experience it.

632
02:32:03,280 --> 02:32:08,540
You have no money? I'll be all right. Why don't you come with me?

633
02:32:16,770 --> 02:32:26,020
All right. Bathroom. Yeah, I'm going to retire. It's time. Come on. Get some sleep. Get up.

634
02:32:26,020 --> 02:32:34,270
And then I'm celebrating New Year's Eve. Shit. All right. One more day of work.

635
02:32:36,819 --> 02:32:42,260
Winterfest is tomorrow. I'm going to a werewolf party. I'm going to a werewolf party tomorrow.

636
02:32:42,260 --> 02:32:47,420
I'm just going to go find one and we're going to. Well, how am I going to get invited to anything?

637
02:32:47,420 --> 02:33:05,420
Why can I? I need to get invited to a party. I might not get invited to anything.

638
02:33:05,420 --> 02:33:12,020
They're enraged. I need the money. They were cool. I'm going to, I'm going to sell them to a

639
02:33:12,659 --> 02:33:21,840
beekeeper. I just sold them to a beekeeper to take care of them. All right. I got a thousand bucks.

640
02:33:22,479 --> 02:33:39,940
I'm going to sleep and then it's time for New Year's Eve. Get up early. Pay your bills. I will.

641
02:33:40,420 --> 02:33:50,180
I got it. Wait till he wakes up. Then we're going to go to werewolf town for New Year's

642
02:33:50,180 --> 02:34:04,260
Eve and it's going to be awesome. Pay bills. Take a shower. Eat. You can take a bath. Whatever.

643
02:34:07,760 --> 02:34:14,850
Better mood. Watch TV. We need to clean the fridge out. Clean out the spoiled food and then I'm going

644
02:34:14,850 --> 02:34:21,010
to make a delicious breakfast. Winterfest. Oh, it is Winterfest. Yeah, I'm going to a werewolf

645
02:34:21,090 --> 02:34:46,700
Christmas party. Why? Unfulfilled dreams. What are you doing? Oh, a nice yogurt. Okay.

646
02:34:46,700 --> 02:34:53,469
Eat the yogurt. What's wrong? That's so just trash. Oh, it's because clean. I gotta clean the fridge

647
02:34:53,469 --> 02:35:02,639
out. Wait, what if I bring a turkey somewhere? All right. I'm going to bring a giant ham dinner,

648
02:35:02,639 --> 02:35:07,440
a grand breakfast. How about a grand breakfast? I'm going to bring it with me in my inventory to

649
02:35:07,440 --> 02:35:27,010
werewolf land. Ham dinner, fish dinner, turkey, grand breakfast. With what money? I have 70 bucks.

650
02:35:27,489 --> 02:35:39,620
Vegetarian safe. What? Oh, it's a tofu turkey. All right. We're doing that. I'm bringing a,

651
02:35:39,620 --> 02:35:56,079
I'm bringing tofu to a werewolf party. How do you make this? Let's see. Yes. Fun. I'm glad

652
02:35:56,079 --> 02:36:17,969
you're having a good time. Just finish it. Stop with this dancing. Yummies. I love tofu. Oh my

653
02:36:17,969 --> 02:36:36,819
God. It's always when he's cooking. Let me guess. Wow. No. All right. Here's the tofu turkey. Um,

654
02:36:37,139 --> 02:36:59,739
it's dead. Very cool. Here it comes. Yup. Yup. Uh huh. Good. Take it out. Grand meal. I have it.

655
02:36:59,739 --> 02:37:10,659
I've got it. Oh, is it burnt? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't go near it. Don't go near it.

656
02:37:10,659 --> 02:37:39,569
Call the fire department. This shit is burnt. Fire, please. Oh my God. It smells in here.

657
02:37:49,069 --> 02:37:56,209
It stinks in here. You didn't even finish. You didn't finish. The house is still on fire.

658
02:38:03,059 --> 02:38:29,200
Oh my goodness. You're not finishing the job. What are you complaining about? What are you doing?

659
02:38:46,530 --> 02:38:56,959
Thank you. All right. Let's take this burnt ass turkey and let's go. I just need to pee and then

660
02:38:56,959 --> 02:39:05,600
we're out of here. I don't have to pee anymore. That's fine. Okay. So I need to take a shower

661
02:39:05,600 --> 02:39:26,239
quick. All right. Turkey. Sabotage food. Okay. I want to put this away, right? I'm going to put

662
02:39:26,239 --> 02:39:34,860
it in inventory. Okay. I got my, I got my tofu burnt turkey. I'm ready. I just need it. Okay.

663
02:39:34,860 --> 02:39:50,540
All right. Let's go to werewolf land and, uh, let's go have a holiday party. So let's travel

664
02:39:51,739 --> 02:40:11,010
to somebody's party. Okay. I'm just going to go by myself. So where is werewolf land? This one

665
02:40:11,090 --> 02:40:25,260
here. Moonwood mill. Okay. Library. Bar. Okay. Residence. Where should I go? I just go see if

666
02:40:25,260 --> 02:40:49,360
somebody, like anybody, does anybody live here? I'm just going to go to the werewolf bar. It is

667
02:40:49,360 --> 02:41:24,290
holiday season here. There's nobody here. This place sucks. We're going to light this on fire.

668
02:41:24,290 --> 02:41:29,020
Where's the party?

669
02:41:29,020 --> 02:42:14,100
What the fuck is this? We're going to go on a mountain climb excursion. Weenie roast. Oh,

670
02:42:14,100 --> 02:42:22,479
that's not a bad idea. Let's do a weenie roast. I'll be hosting it. Um, everybody's invited.

671
02:42:22,479 --> 02:42:41,299
Jeffrey Landgraab looks different. This person is still in their costume from the neighborhood

672
02:42:41,299 --> 02:43:00,930
brawl event. The grill master. Um, that'd be, uh, that'd be you. The grill master. And we're

673
02:43:00,930 --> 02:43:11,979
doing it right here. Wait, we should go to the, let's go to the Landgraab residence,

674
02:43:17,709 --> 02:43:30,579
right? Why not? Look at this place. This place is huge. Can I even do it here? I don't think I can

675
02:43:30,579 --> 02:43:39,329
even do it here. Let's go to the Landgrabs. They probably have Christmas stuff up too.

676
02:43:39,329 --> 02:44:06,110
There's no campfire. I'm just walking in the front door. We need a campfire. How do I get a campfire?

677
02:44:06,110 --> 02:44:18,049
It's not a very good weenie roast without a campfire. Check for gifts in the mailbox.

678
02:44:20,079 --> 02:44:23,040
All right. Let's see if you have anything in the mailbox that I can take.

679
02:44:23,120 --> 02:44:38,350
Anything delivered? Excuse me? Whoa! What's happening? Somebody's stabbing me. What?

680
02:44:38,350 --> 02:45:09,899
What happened? What? Cheering. Am I dead? Right when I got a gold bar, I wouldn't even get to have

681
02:45:09,899 --> 02:45:29,649
my fucking turkey. I'm going down. Everybody is. Wake up. Get up. Wait, where's my, where's that

682
02:45:29,649 --> 02:45:37,459
poisoned cake? I want you to bury me with my lightsaber. We'll be in the coffin with it.

683
02:45:37,459 --> 02:46:09,120
I want to be buried with my first order of uniform. What do I do? We need to make a new sim?

684
02:46:11,600 --> 02:46:16,239
I, dude, did you see what it said up there? It said I took like a 24-garret gold bar out of this

685
02:46:16,239 --> 02:46:33,739
guy's mailbox. I don't understand why I got stabbed. There's no, there's no autonomous killing.

686
02:46:33,739 --> 02:46:49,870
It's off. I don't know why that happened. We're making a werewolf. Well, there goes McNulty.

687
02:46:53,329 --> 02:46:56,450
Everyone say goodbye to Lord McNulty. Now we're making a werewolf.

688
02:47:09,040 --> 02:47:26,190
Nature. Outdoor enthusiast. Yep. Animal. Oh, no, nevermind. Oh, wait. Okay. Yeah. I want

689
02:47:26,190 --> 02:47:32,590
werewolf. The sim wants to unleash his inner beast and become a werewolf. He seems to get

690
02:47:32,590 --> 02:47:41,760
an initial relationship boost when introducing themselves to werewolves. Okay. Baking. How's that

691
02:47:41,760 --> 02:47:52,020
sound? That sounds kind of cool. Fitness. I don't want to make this guy, I don't want to make this

692
02:47:52,020 --> 02:47:57,379
guy a fucking just complete and total loser, right? Like we have to make this, they got to be cool.

693
02:47:58,100 --> 02:48:18,799
Move your camera. Baking. Piano. Rock climbing. Rocket science. The violin. That's interesting.

694
02:48:26,379 --> 02:48:33,250
Not a werewolf. I'm making a werewolf. How about just, um, how about, I don't know, baking?

695
02:48:34,049 --> 02:48:52,510
How about photography? Now we're doing rock climbing. Oh, I have to, right, right, right,

696
02:48:52,510 --> 02:49:04,030
right. Okay. Okay. Baking. Fitness. Fishing. Rock climbing and the violin. What do you don't like?

697
02:49:04,829 --> 02:49:10,020
You don't like, um, you don't, I mean, you like DJ music. That's fine.

698
02:49:11,139 --> 02:49:23,139
No lullabies. No kids music. Uh, also you don't like, uh, gardening. You also don't like, um,

699
02:49:23,780 --> 02:50:12,049
photography. Snob. Loves the outdoors, right? I mean, I'm a werewolf. Bro. Bro? Bro. Okay. Here

700
02:50:12,049 --> 02:50:50,129
we go. How do I make, how do I pick werewolf form? I didn't make him a werewolf? How do I do it?

701
02:50:50,129 --> 02:50:59,120
Make a normal guy. I don't want to make a normal guy. How do I make him a werewolf?

702
02:50:59,120 --> 02:51:21,379
Add to sim. Oh, we're, we're, is it a cult? Werewolf. Oh, okay. Here we go. I mean,

703
02:51:22,590 --> 02:51:28,739
I can't, can he, he's got to live with this guy. Okay. All right. All right. All right. We have,

704
02:51:28,739 --> 02:52:09,579
we need, this is going to take a while. Okay. This kind of looks like a guy,

705
02:52:10,299 --> 02:52:19,100
this is a guy covered in whipped cream. This doesn't look like a werewolf.

706
02:52:19,100 --> 02:52:22,139
What is this a werewolf? It looks like somebody has a cool whip all over him.

707
02:52:25,700 --> 02:52:58,959
All right. We're going to keep the cool whip man. Noses. Oh wait. Teeth. Okay. Hold on. Teeth.

708
02:52:58,959 --> 02:53:24,110
Okay. I want these. I want these for sure. Or these ones. I don't know. Yeah. This is just weird

709
02:53:24,110 --> 02:53:35,729
looking. All right. I like this. What about ears? You know, when you're in the bubble bath and you

710
02:53:35,729 --> 02:53:55,819
just do a bubble bath, this is a bubble bath werewolf. Okay. Faces. No, it's perfect the way

711
02:53:55,819 --> 02:54:37,040
it is. I don't want to change anything. This one is, it's good though, but no, I can't stop doing

712
02:54:37,040 --> 02:55:05,040
that. Goodness. Okay. What else can we do? Wait, I don't want to add this many things. Oh wait. No,

713
02:55:05,040 --> 02:55:14,139
I don't, we, I don't want, no, no, no, no, no. Those are cool accessories, but I want to be

714
02:55:14,139 --> 02:55:37,500
accessory-less. You made Brian Griffin? Okay. But dude, so this is what your human form is.

715
02:55:37,500 --> 02:55:43,229
If I change anything, will the werewolf form change if I change anything?

716
02:55:43,229 --> 02:56:06,819
So I can't change this. Okay. Oh shit. All right. Um, unlink them. Oh, there we go. Okay.

717
02:56:07,379 --> 02:56:37,379
So this is where it is now. And now we can, these eyes need to change. Oh God. I think,

718
02:56:37,379 --> 02:56:50,190
I think it has to stay. I don't, I don't, I don't think it changes. Maybe let's see what

719
02:56:50,190 --> 02:57:17,790
the different hair is. It's the, it's the hello neighbor guy. That's good. That's pretty good.

720
02:57:18,500 --> 02:57:29,940
But the hello neighbor guy would have hair like this. I need, I actually like that. I like that

721
02:57:29,940 --> 02:58:08,219
a lot. I don't know how much longer I can listen to this. I mean, I need, I need to have, I like,

722
02:58:08,219 --> 03:00:15,819
okay, this is perfect. Keep it red. Okay. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done.

723
03:00:15,819 --> 03:00:20,059
All right. We need to do aspirates. Just please stop doing that aspirations. You're a werewolf.

724
03:00:20,059 --> 03:00:25,569
That's what you want to do. You want to be that your favorite activity is you like baking. You

725
03:00:25,569 --> 03:00:31,549
don't really like bowling. You like DJs. You like fitness. You like fishing. You like the violin.

03:00:31,549 --> 03:00:36,659
You like rock climbing. You like the violin. You don't like snowboarding. You like, you don't like

727
03:00:36,659 --> 03:00:43,569
rocket science. You like the organ and you don't like programming. Sounds good. Okay. Now we're

728
03:00:43,569 --> 03:00:55,760
going to do, what did we do before? Adventurous. We're also going to do of the outdoors. We're also

729
03:00:55,760 --> 03:01:06,379
going to do snob loner. No, anytime you do loner, it's awful because you can never hang out with

730
03:01:06,379 --> 03:01:25,139
anybody, bro. All right, bro. Okay. I think we're ready. Let's, let's, let's maybe add a cat.

There's a lot of cats. Cap you. All right. All right. Ears more like a frog than it is a cat.

732
03:03:12,510 --> 03:04:05,250
Looks like a dog. Fluffy, friendly and a free spirit. All right. I think we're ready.

733
03:04:05,250 --> 03:04:42,260
Do I, should I just delete this guy? Delete this one? My name is, I don't know, Fred. Um, Anthony,

743
03:08:10,979 --> 03:08:16,299
Is anybody going to care if I eat this guy in like the first five minutes? Are you going to be mad?

744
03:08:23,280 --> 03:08:28,610
Uh, wait, where the butane household is moving? Wait, what do we move with the butanes? Wait a

745
03:08:28,610 --> 03:08:36,020
minute. Um, uh, what's going on on? Oh, there. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We want to be here because

747
03:08:56,510 --> 03:09:15,819
Time didn't stop. This is a good spot, right? Like right here. Yeah. Time didn't stop. Save the game.

748
03:09:15,819 --> 03:09:21,180
Bro lesson. Jerry is a bro. Bros love watching sports, being around other bros and know how

03:09:52,750 --> 03:10:28,899
Can I, I can drag a whole room. Can't I do this quick? Look at this. Not a bad house. All right.

753
03:10:28,899 --> 03:10:45,780
Doors. I need a door for here. Not doing a public bathroom. Does this make sense? Because

03:10:45,780 --> 03:11:02,510
this could be like the kitchen or something. Yeah. I need stuff for the animal. All right. First

755

758
03:11:28,559 --> 03:11:32,959
All right. That's, this is the kitchen. This is going to be living room here. We'll just go with

03:11:49,360 --> 03:12:01,579
I may, I'm going quick. Okay. This is the, so this is the kitchen, living room, bathroom.

761
03:12:02,780 --> 03:12:10,819
This is a bedroom. We need two bedrooms, two bedrooms because we're a roommate here. All right.

762
03:12:10,819 --> 03:12:16,590
Roommates, bedrooms. I need another bedroom. No, I'm going to eat them. I'm going to eat the guy.

763
03:12:16,590 --> 03:12:21,069
I'm going to eat the guy in 10 minutes. Go to the, click the light bulb.

764
03:12:21,069 --> 03:12:30,530
What? Use the gallery. Oh, well it's too late. I'm too late. I'm doing this already.

765
03:12:31,170 --> 03:12:40,510
I'm already building. Delete the house. I'm already building. I'm building. It's too late.

03:12:41,069 --> 03:12:50,829
Well, now I'm into it now. Now I want to do it. All right. So this is, uh, I want a second bedroom.

No, who cares? Just, I just have two beds or who cares? I have one bed. What? Who cares?

768
03:12:56,030 --> 03:13:03,250
Who gives a shit? This guy's getting eaten within 24 hours. I'm just telling you what's happening.

769
03:13:03,250 --> 03:13:47,040
It's just, I don't like him. I don't like that. Don't put wallpaper. This is a kid's bedroom.

770
03:13:49,379 --> 03:14:03,729
Put him, like, put him next to each other like this. Somebody said, dude, this is a Burton Ernie

771
03:14:03,729 --> 03:14:16,959
room. I, it's kind, yeah, whatever. Fine. It's Burton Ernie room. That doesn't, I don't care.

772
03:14:16,959 --> 03:14:22,459
There's a bookcase in the middle of the Burton Ernie room, isn't there? All right. That's fine.

773
03:14:23,020 --> 03:14:37,100
Put a lamp in here. They just need to sleep in here and who cares? All right. I just need,

774
03:14:37,100 --> 03:14:40,540
I'm putting wallpaper up. I'm not going to listen to you weirdos that are saying,

775
03:14:40,540 --> 03:15:12,319
don't put wallpaper in here. Why? Hey, what about, that's not bad. That's not bad. That's not bad.

776
03:15:12,319 --> 03:16:00,719
Be a little lighter. Look at this. Okay. Now we need some windows. Look at that. We need some

777
03:16:00,719 --> 03:16:23,809
doors. So this is the bedroom. This is a, um, it doesn't matter. Whatever. Who cares? Okay.

778
03:16:23,809 --> 03:16:33,680
I'm not screwing this up this time. So now I need some wallpaper in here and I need some,

779
03:16:33,680 --> 03:16:41,649
I need the floors. All right. Floor time. We're going to go with something nice. Maybe a little

780
03:16:41,649 --> 03:17:14,579
bit of carpet. That's cool. Um, sure. And then kitchen. It's that easy. Uh, what about the

781
03:17:14,579 --> 03:17:28,530
outside? Yeah, it doesn't look good. All right. I need paint for the outside siding. Where is it?

782
03:17:42,819 --> 03:18:13,020
No, no. It looks like a, like a warehouse. It's a, it's all right. Okay. Now I need a roof. How do

783
03:18:13,020 --> 03:18:26,579
you do roofs by the way? I don't understand how this works. And like, I just honestly kind of

784
03:18:26,579 --> 03:18:46,930
don't care because nobody sees it. Nobody sees it. It doesn't matter. You're the only time you're

785
03:18:46,930 --> 03:18:55,700
ever going to see this is when we're in this menu right now. So no, it doesn't matter. There we go.

786
03:18:55,700 --> 03:19:04,100
Look at that. It's fine. Oh, we need to have like a little back, uh, area here. Okay. Let's have a,

03:19:04,100 --> 03:19:35,659
go to the outside to get to the backyard. All right. Now we need furniture. Bathroom. We can

03:19:35,659 --> 03:19:40,139
have a piss bush in the bathroom. All right. There's a, you can have, I can have a piss bush.

789
03:19:40,139 --> 03:20:00,159
Should we go to the bathroom? I mean, I'm a, I'm a werewolf. I am a werewolf. Ooh, I like that.

790
03:20:00,159 --> 03:20:18,420
I need the walls up. Uh, there's the sink. Now I need a shower. I have to extend this a little

791
03:20:18,420 --> 03:20:52,319
bit better. A little bit this way. That's better. Hurry up. This is half a game, man. I need a mirror.

792
03:20:52,319 --> 03:21:11,870
That's in a weird spot. I don't like that. Uh, I need a shower. Just a regular shower. Something

793
03:21:11,870 --> 03:21:25,870
nice. Spend the money on it. This thing's not bad. This thing's all right. All right. Good. Um,

794
03:21:25,870 --> 03:21:32,100
bathroom is set. I want, could they actually use this bathroom? Is it a shit bush too? Because

795
03:21:32,100 --> 03:21:42,930
that's actually pretty funny. All right. I need a litter box. We're going to get the automatic one.

796
03:21:42,930 --> 03:21:52,930
This one's way more expensive. What's the difference? I think it's way, why is it so expensive?

797
03:21:53,489 --> 03:22:10,059
Okay. Now I need a couple of toys. Let's do this. Uh, over here. And then I got a cat toy.

798
03:22:10,620 --> 03:22:21,979
Did I get, oh wait, wait, wait. This is cool. Wait, let's get one of these. Okay. Now let's do,

799
03:22:22,940 --> 03:22:39,889
let's get a rug. Why not? What a rug. Wait. Okay. Now I got the bedroom done. I just need a living

800
03:22:39,889 --> 03:22:53,100
room. Did I not have a couch the entire last person's entire life? It wasn't a couch the entire

801
03:22:53,100 --> 03:22:59,309
game. The three streams of this game that I've not had a couch. That's it. Okay. That's probably a

802
03:22:59,309 --> 03:23:09,569
lot of the problem. All right. I'm going to get just something nice. How about the mega sofa?

803
03:23:10,129 --> 03:23:22,819
Hmm. This thing's pretty nice. Pretty modern. This one's all right. Let's get a, I don't know,

804
03:23:22,819 --> 03:23:35,760
just like a, that's fine. All right. TV is going to be here and then we need a table, a TV right

805
03:23:35,760 --> 03:23:46,829
there. I need a table here. The kitchen shit over there. All right. Uh, TV. I want a good TV this

806
03:23:46,829 --> 03:24:06,139
time. How much is this? This is 4,200. This is $10,000. Oh my God. No, too small. Too small.

807
03:24:06,139 --> 03:24:22,350
Why are these so expensive? This is so expensive. Whatever. It's fine. Okay. Now I need just like a

808
03:24:22,350 --> 03:24:50,260
table. Ooh, that's cool. Let's do this. Right. Or like that console on there. Look at that. I need

809
03:24:50,260 --> 03:25:15,790
lights. I will. I'll put lights in just wait. Uh, it's like why does this seem so cramped? Now I need

810
03:25:16,350 --> 03:26:02,579
a big rug. That's big rug. Uh, now I gotta get a painting or something. Get in there. Nothing's

811
03:26:02,579 --> 03:26:31,920
too big. I don't want that. Um, I got lights in there. Lamp Andy. What? I can't have lamps.

812
03:26:31,920 --> 03:26:47,409
Everything has to be a recessed lighting. All right. Kitchen time. An expensive ass bridge.

813
03:26:47,409 --> 03:27:10,479
No, I don't want to go broke. All right. That's fine. There is trash. Perfect placement. There's

814
03:27:10,479 --> 03:27:45,010
sink. Something nice. This thing is huge. This is just a coffee maker. This thing's fine. That

815
03:27:45,010 --> 03:27:49,250
thing's also huge. These are so big. How about this little thing? All right. That's fine.

816
03:27:50,049 --> 03:28:17,219
All right. So I've got, I need a, I need a stove. Oops. All right. I am ready to move. I got a

817
03:28:17,219 --> 03:28:33,969
counter space. Should I have one more counter? I can get into the fridge still here. Right. Okay.

818
03:28:33,969 --> 03:28:57,540
That's good. I need a space. Okay. Now I need a table. Oh, cabinets. Yeah. Sure. Why not? This

819
03:28:57,540 --> 03:29:21,840
is kind of too much. I, yeah. Nevermind. I need the money. Um, anything worth anything here? What?

820
03:29:21,840 --> 03:29:38,219
I can sell my mailbox. I need a trash can. Okay. Now just a table and I'm done. Just a little one.

821
03:29:38,219 --> 03:29:55,950
Just something shitty and then a couple of just shitty chairs and I'm fine. That's bad. All right.

822
03:29:55,950 --> 03:30:28,190
Let's go. How do I turn into a werewolf? Oh, it's winter fest. Right. Oh, wait. Oh, wait. We need

823
03:30:28,190 --> 03:30:47,229
to light that. It is winter fest. Fest of spirit. Open presents. Grand meal. I mean, we don't,

824
03:30:47,229 --> 03:31:02,829
we don't know how to cook. I'm crying. Where's the fire alarm? Um, oh, okay. All right.

825
03:31:02,829 --> 03:31:07,229
Does he know that I'm a werewolf?

826
03:31:24,420 --> 03:31:25,219
He didn't like that.

827
03:31:32,459 --> 03:31:39,950
Okay. Um, why can I hear? I can hear them.

828
03:31:40,959 --> 03:32:07,379
We're going to have to hold on to that for a sec.

829
03:32:21,389 --> 03:32:29,250
Does Santa actually show up? No, we need to cook a grand meal. I gotta give presents. Here we go.

830
03:32:29,250 --> 03:32:35,250
Like belly laugh. We have to like, oh, that was funny. We had fun on winter fest.

831
03:32:37,329 --> 03:32:42,530
Cool. He's in a row. Okay. Now we're going to sing. Let's sing together.

832
03:32:48,290 --> 03:32:48,610
Okay.

833
03:33:00,530 --> 03:33:05,489
What about the turkey dinner guy? This is a different character. That other guy got stabbed.

834
03:33:21,969 --> 03:33:32,049
That's a pretty good Santa. Oh, I need a gift box, right? Pet obsessions. Oh, right. They get

835
03:33:32,049 --> 03:33:37,120
obsessed with random things. All right. No, no, no. Don't cook. Um, we need to cook a grand. No,

836
03:33:37,120 --> 03:33:50,100
I don't want Franks and beans. I want a grand holiday meal. We're gonna have a fish dinner.

837
03:33:52,260 --> 03:33:58,479
I'll take care of it. I'll handle it. We're both going to try to go get this on the same stove.

838
03:33:59,760 --> 03:34:16,930
Okay. It's so dark in here. What's, what's wrong? Oh, it's a Fortnite dance. I thought

839
03:34:16,930 --> 03:34:28,399
I thought he was poisoned. Okay. I wanted just to eat that raw. What was it just going to do?

840
03:34:28,399 --> 03:34:34,290
Oh, right, right, right. I'll give you some more light. All the complaining light Andes here.

841
03:34:34,930 --> 03:35:06,299
There you go. Look at that. Everybody can see. Wow. There was a cat going to eat this.

842
03:35:06,299 --> 03:35:29,329
We need to make a grand meal. So gross. What? Where? Already? How does this keep fucking

843
03:35:29,329 --> 03:35:37,709
happening? What? Help. Put me out. Put me out. Stop playing with the cat. Put me out.

844
03:35:43,010 --> 03:36:07,100
What the fuck? We're good. Put it out. What are you doing? No, no, no. Call the fire department.

845
03:36:07,100 --> 03:36:09,659
Call the fire department. Call, call, call, call, call. Get out, out, out, out. Run, run, run, run,

846
03:36:09,659 --> 03:36:19,549
get out of the way. Where are you? Somebody has to call the fire department. Pick up the phone. How

847
03:36:19,549 --> 03:36:27,309
do I call the fire department? Why can't I call the fire department? Oh, there it is. Okay. Do it.

848
03:36:34,799 --> 03:36:48,620
Don't go over to it. Help. Stop standing near the fire. For the love of God. Where's the fire

849
03:36:48,620 --> 03:36:59,180
department? Come put the fire out over here. I would be very appreciated. It's the whole backyard.

850
03:36:59,180 --> 03:37:35,250
Help. Thank you. Go get it, please. There's so much fire. There's so much. Who is this?

851
03:37:35,250 --> 03:38:05,379
Where's the cat? What are you doing in here? He's back. What, what is he doing here? He's back.

852
03:38:05,379 --> 03:38:20,780
Okay. This fire is still there though. Sniff and introduce? Is that a werewolf thing? I don't

853
03:38:20,780 --> 03:38:54,639
understand. Wait, what do you mean sniff? This is a different guy. This is a different guy.

854
03:38:58,639 --> 03:39:14,610
I'm going to find him for presents. How do I turn into a werewolf?

855
03:39:44,430 --> 03:39:45,549
It is a different person.

856
03:39:45,549 --> 03:39:57,250
Listen. Holy shit. A knife set?

857
03:40:11,629 --> 03:40:35,280
What did you do? Why do I hear fire? Oh, thank God. I was going to say.

858
03:40:42,239 --> 03:41:05,709
I take a wild shower, but I can smash it. What is a wild shower? You need to eat Santa.

859
03:42:05,780 --> 03:42:12,459
He's still here. I feel like that's kind of mocking. Isn't it?

860
03:42:12,940 --> 03:42:20,579
Oh, oh, oh, so you are. Get on better term.

861
03:42:21,700 --> 03:42:35,440
Feed the cat. Oh, it's the automatic feeder. Right. Um, you get up and you do it. Oh,

862
03:42:35,440 --> 03:43:07,629
Santa. Do you want some, uh, a plate? I love how it's a different guy. I can't get over it.

863
03:43:08,350 --> 03:43:12,829
Somebody else. Oh, is he leaving? All right. Well, goodbye. Thanks for coming, Santa.

864
03:43:13,549 --> 03:43:29,700
Well, that was a fun winter fest. One ability. Oh, I have ability points.

865
03:43:34,850 --> 03:43:56,129
Wolf nap. Territory marking. Okay. Personal grooming. Okay. Wait, hold on. Can I piss on the

866
03:43:56,129 --> 03:44:19,500
couch?

867
03:44:38,100 --> 03:44:45,299
How many times can I do this? I can't just do that everywhere, right?

868
03:44:49,459 --> 03:44:56,590
What's wrong? Why am I glowing? Oh, you want to do a fart off, don't you? You want to do a fart

869
03:44:56,590 --> 03:45:26,209
off. I got you. Okay. I can't, can't. All right. All right. All right. All right. That's enough.

870
03:45:27,409 --> 03:46:11,860
Why is it so dark? This is ominous. It is dark out here. Like really dark. I don't know. I can't.

871
03:46:11,860 --> 03:46:21,780
This was an expensive stove too. That's such bullshit. I don't, I can't replace it.

872
03:46:35,020 --> 03:46:44,979
Play. I need to take a bath or a shower or something. This is funny. This was funny,

873
03:46:44,979 --> 03:46:48,979
but it's time to, it's time to buy an actual toilet. I don't, we need to have them be able

874
03:46:48,979 --> 03:47:17,600
to go to the bathroom. Actual toilet time. Okay. That's better. All right. How are you doing?

875
03:47:18,479 --> 03:47:25,440
You need to go to the bathroom. Go to the bathroom. Sad. What an awful holiday.

876
03:47:33,170 --> 03:47:43,500
How long do you sleep for? Like four hours. That's actually not very much time.

877
03:47:44,059 --> 03:47:58,459
Still, I have $96. This sucks. What the hell am I supposed to do about this?

878
03:47:59,100 --> 03:48:04,659
This shit still works. Whatever. Was he gonna have to eat microwave food for a little while?

879
03:48:10,479 --> 03:48:16,930
Fury. As fury grows, their animalistic instincts begin to manifest and will eventually take over.

880
03:48:16,930 --> 03:48:21,760
Fury gain is constant and is hastened by Werewolf Ability's full moon

881
03:48:22,559 --> 03:48:35,540
preferences. Wait, so I, I, I, I turn? All right. Well, you gotta clean this up. What is this?

882
03:48:39,120 --> 03:48:49,379
Port of potties? Portal potties. Weird. What is this? Okay. Cool. We'll check that out tomorrow.

883
03:48:49,940 --> 03:49:15,709
Snowing. First snow of the season. Oh, that's cute. You should go to bed. Bert and Ernie.

884
03:49:16,590 --> 03:49:50,979
Anthony's a bro. All right. Get up. Look at the snow. Get up. Get up. It's snowing up. Look at

885
03:49:52,059 --> 03:50:03,889
what is going on with my guy. He's supposed to go hollow. Come on. First snow of the season. Let's

886
03:50:03,889 --> 03:51:11,629
go. Let's go. Coming together. Eating it. Attempts similish communication.

887
03:51:20,319 --> 03:51:21,280
Pretending to be human.

888
03:51:21,840 --> 03:51:55,940
Oh, this would be weird. This is weird. This would be very weird. It's at this moment where

889
03:51:55,940 --> 03:52:08,850
this roommate kind of just goes, how much is for me to break the lease and leave? Come on, dude.

890
03:52:10,129 --> 03:52:30,180
The beast beckons. What? Wait, he's just, he's lost control. He's kind of just being taken over.

891
03:52:30,180 --> 03:52:45,860
I don't know how to use a phone. Where's the cat? How is this fridge already broken?

892
03:52:45,860 --> 03:52:59,180
It's been one day. How is it already broken? What the fuck? It's been one day. He's already

893
03:52:59,180 --> 03:53:13,280
going back to bed. Why? Awful holiday. Is it because I was licking my hands? That thing's cute.

894
03:53:13,840 --> 03:53:36,299
Okay. I need to, I need to, what am I doing here? I need to eat something. What? He's going to start

895
03:53:36,299 --> 03:53:53,649
rampaging. That is not until. Oh my God. Where's he going? Oh my God. He's going to watch out.

896
03:53:53,649 --> 03:54:44,850
Jerry's transforming. Okay. Are there other werewolves coming over here? I look like I belong

897
03:54:44,850 --> 03:54:56,770
in a Wallace and Gromit movie. A police cruiser has been dispatched. Oh shit. I definitely did it.

898
03:54:57,569 --> 03:56:01,409
Oh God. No, are these people? What happened? Wait, what did I do? Why is he dead? Why is he dead?

899
03:56:01,409 --> 03:56:45,250
Why did that guy die? Whose guts am I ripping out? This guy's not dead. He fell asleep. This

900
03:56:45,250 --> 03:56:55,120
guy's asleep. He took a book off the shelf. Okay. Well, why, why won't this guy get up?

901
03:56:55,120 --> 03:57:57,600
It's in regular clothes. Where did I just go? I don't know what's going on here, but you need to

902
03:57:57,600 --> 03:58:21,760
go home. Okay. Well that was cool, I guess. Where's the house? He got up. He got up. He woke up. He

903
03:58:21,760 --> 03:59:23,120
woke up. Oh, well that was kind of crazy. Do not save. That was wacky. A helicopter like, I don't

904
03:59:23,120 --> 04:00:13,040
even know what happened there. Wait, I'm enraged still. How do I stop? How do I stop? Play with a

905
04:00:13,040 --> 04:00:24,540
silver sword. I don't know what to do. How do I get him to actually, when does he stop doing this?

906
04:00:24,540 --> 04:00:43,709
Two more hours? Well, all right. Whatever. Good luck. I got points. We'll just hang out in here.

907
04:00:46,110 --> 04:01:01,620
Just lock him outside. That's actually not a bad idea. All right. Just chill out of there. Bored?

908
04:01:01,620 --> 04:01:12,510
There's no decorations? All right. Somebody has to get a job and it's definitely not going to be you.

909
04:01:12,510 --> 04:01:29,489
Why is this person in the house? This guy sucks. Why is this person in the house?

910
04:01:55,469 --> 04:01:59,219
This guy's a fucking dork. What?

911
04:02:02,579 --> 04:02:12,799
Why you don't like the cat? Who are these people? They've shown up twice.

912
04:02:13,360 --> 04:02:50,940
Gary's now a werewolf runt. Oh god, where am I going? I'm chasing this guy down. Werewolf hangouts?

913
04:02:50,940 --> 04:02:58,579
I can't do any of this stuff.

914
04:03:36,719 --> 04:04:04,579
Oh, I'm back to normal now. I'm back to normal. Oh no, no, no. That's not happening. We have no

915
04:04:04,579 --> 04:04:16,430
money. What did I spend up? We've got a stupid plasma screen TV. Just get rid of this. God damn

916
04:04:16,510 --> 04:04:24,110
it. We have to do this stupid shit again. I have to start over again. I have to start over.

917
04:04:25,069 --> 04:04:29,840
I have to start over. I have to start over. I'm going to start over. I'm starting over.

918
04:04:29,840 --> 04:04:38,940
I can't just in the house, right? Wait, why is it you?

919
04:04:44,750 --> 04:05:07,950
Why did he do that? With a bowl of fucking cereal. With one hand holding a bowl of sausage. What are

920
04:05:07,950 --> 04:06:07,040
you eating? What is he eating? What is in his hand? He's already what? Excuse me? The car come

921
04:06:07,040 --> 04:06:30,209
bro. I got to stop. All right. No more. We're not doing any more. We're going to, you're going to

922
04:06:30,209 --> 04:06:57,729
do your time. We're not, we're just going to relax now. We're going to get, we're going to get a job.

923
04:06:57,729 --> 04:07:07,040
I don't want all these everywhere. We need to get, I don't want these urns everywhere.

924
04:07:07,280 --> 04:07:20,930
No, it was cheese crackers is what it was. Clean up. Clean up. We're going to reset back to zero.

925
04:07:20,930 --> 04:07:27,469
Of course, this fridge is broken already because we had a fire. This all went off the rails

926
04:07:28,030 --> 04:08:03,700
because of the fire that happened in the first 10 seconds. I actually, I need you. So somebody has

927
04:08:03,700 --> 04:08:10,860
to repair this. You repair that. I'll repair the coffee maker. TV is fine. I might even just sell

928
04:08:10,860 --> 04:08:24,610
the TV. Jerry is adventurous. We don't have enough money to do anything. So we need to do this.

929
04:08:24,610 --> 04:08:31,149
Death, please get out of here. We're going to clean the house. That's fixed. Coffee maker is

930
04:08:31,149 --> 04:08:41,700
about to be fixed. Things are getting a little better. Clean up. Throw this away. You also,

931
04:08:41,700 --> 04:08:54,610
you know, clean up a little bit. How's the coffee maker is fine. Okay. Everything looks good. Take

932
04:08:54,610 --> 04:09:05,629
a shower. You take a shower too. And then we're going to get jobs tomorrow. Oh, maybe one of us

933
04:09:05,629 --> 04:09:24,610
will. How do you still, why do you still have blood all over you? Oh, there it is. Okay.

934
04:09:33,040 --> 04:09:59,329
What am I doing? This is worse than my torque. Who is supposed to pay the money though?

935
04:09:59,329 --> 04:10:19,090
When was I, wait, when did I get electrocuted? We lost $8. How? Oh, cause you're making a coffee.

936
04:10:19,090 --> 04:10:54,180
This is not working. All right. At least make a salad. Very good. Did you only make one serving?

937
04:10:54,180 --> 04:11:06,979
Come on, really? You actually don't need to eat. Uh, you go to bed. How much is it? It's 11. Yeah,

938
04:11:06,979 --> 04:11:23,649
go to bed. I need to shower, use the bathroom and go to bed. No, why would I want to smash?

939
04:11:23,649 --> 04:11:56,819
So far so good. Werewolves. I hear them. Have a sim do nothing solider for 24 sim hours.

940
04:11:56,819 --> 04:12:06,530
Really? I feel like we did a lot of stuff. Oh my, look at, look at how cute that is.

941
04:12:06,530 --> 04:12:20,100
Oh my goodness. It's on the calendar today. Wait, it's New Year's Eve. Oh no, no, that's tomorrow.

942
04:12:20,100 --> 04:12:34,159
All right. New Year's Eve is tomorrow. We're going to go celebrate. Lunar peace. Oh, all right.

943
04:12:34,159 --> 04:12:45,629
Both get up. Yeah. You want to have a drink at the club. Okay. Catch a fish. I don't know.

944
04:12:45,629 --> 04:12:53,489
We're not going to really do that right now. All right. Is there still any salad fridge?

945
04:12:53,489 --> 04:13:05,840
How about a fruit salad? That sounds good. Go make a salad.

946
04:13:06,639 --> 04:13:14,049
We got to be ready for New Year's Eve tomorrow. Is there a door open?

947
04:13:14,049 --> 04:13:23,520
I don't get it. That solves a lot. It solves everything. Yeah. Let's kick stuff. That's fine.

948
04:13:23,520 --> 04:13:40,989
All right. Prepare for New Year's. Turn this off. I don't want a fire going. Fire is causing so many

949
04:13:40,989 --> 04:13:54,059
problems. Clean this up too. This is a mess. Stop that. Stop that. Stop that. Stop that.

950
04:13:54,059 --> 04:14:14,719
Stop that. Stop that. Stop that. Stop that. Stop that. Stop that. Stop that. Stop that. Stop that.

951
04:14:14,719 --> 04:14:41,870
Causes so many problems. Clean this up too. This is a mess. Stop. Don't do that. You don't like

952
04:14:41,870 --> 04:14:51,790
cooking. That's fine. All right. It's New Year's Eve tomorrow. I don't want any of this stuff. We're

953
04:14:51,790 --> 04:15:09,780
going to go out anyways. You good? Your passion is baking but you don't like cooking. That is

954
04:15:09,780 --> 04:15:34,270
really weird. I thought I was a run. Gross. All right. Who's hungry? All right. Just eat it.

955
04:15:34,829 --> 04:16:05,579
Spend the ability point. I will after eats. Eat first. Why am I doing that? Oh, okay.

956
04:16:06,930 --> 04:16:22,000
These eyes. How do I do first person? Oh, no. What have I done? This is a HUD-less camera mode.

957
04:16:40,750 --> 04:17:03,420
This is fucking weird. Will you go sit down? You're freaking me out.

958
04:17:10,930 --> 04:17:13,489
Sometimes they just do the random dance stuff. I don't know why.

959
04:17:18,510 --> 04:17:42,239
Okay. Hunter. Wait. We have to buy food. I'm going to go do that right now.

960
04:17:43,969 --> 04:17:52,670
All right. I'll be back. I'm going to go get his food. You do whatever you need to do. I'm

961
04:17:52,670 --> 04:18:21,489
going to go hunt for food. Okay. Hunting. Will I get anything? This takes a long time.

962
04:18:26,059 --> 04:18:30,260
Anthony should have a job. Yeah, Anthony should have a job. You're right. I'll look on my phone.

963
04:18:30,260 --> 04:18:41,459
Something easy. Something just easy, right? Not a lot of time. Let's see. All right. We can do

964
04:18:43,920 --> 04:19:13,059
be a critic. This doesn't work, unfortunately. Politician. I'll do critic. Level up writing.

965
04:19:13,059 --> 04:19:24,239
Yes. All right. So I'm a critic. I work in two days. I need to level up writing. I can do that

966
04:19:24,239 --> 04:20:06,799
with a computer. You get any food? Make coffee. Did I get any food? Raw meat? Can we cook this?

967
04:20:17,729 --> 04:20:48,379
Raw what? Well, no, that was a person. Okay. Well, we can make a steak. Are you hungry? You want

968
04:20:48,379 --> 04:20:57,440
a steak? No, we're good. Why are you so bored? Read your book. Purchase the vampire home,

969
04:20:57,440 --> 04:21:05,889
whatever this is. This is, we don't have any money. Nevermind. He's so bored Fortnite dancing.

970
04:21:06,450 --> 04:21:25,090
He was trapped in there. You're going to sleep on the bed? I thought I said raw something,

971
04:21:25,090 --> 04:21:31,860
but it was actually the name of the person. Sell the TV and buy a PC. That's a good idea.

972
04:21:31,860 --> 04:22:19,250
They don't need television. It rots your brain. A desk. This is for little kid. I need a PC. This

973
04:22:19,250 --> 04:22:34,450
thing is all right. This thing's a piece of shit. It's fine. Okay. So, uh, you need to practice

974
04:22:34,450 --> 04:22:52,670
writing. Practice writing. There it is. And you are, you have the muscle of the operation and you

975
04:22:53,709 --> 04:22:59,940
are the cool mascot. We've got the brains, we have the muscle and we get the mascot.

976
04:22:59,940 --> 04:23:13,600
We're good to go. When is New Year's Eve tomorrow? Okay. Let's rest up because we need to make sure

977
04:23:13,600 --> 04:23:45,360
we celebrate. Can you sell the urn? Weirdo. That's my snowman. Yeah. Get out of here. What was he

978
04:23:45,360 --> 04:24:14,930
doing? He shows up. He shows up to my property. I can throw snow at Anthony's face. Oh, I'm all

979
04:24:14,930 --> 04:24:37,120
the way over here. I've got a lucrative opportunity for someone who doesn't ask too many questions.

980
04:24:37,120 --> 04:25:06,899
I need to do one. I'll take it. I want to shove snow on his face. Stop working. I want to put

981
04:25:06,899 --> 04:25:22,579
snow on your face. All right. Wait till you get one point. There it is. All right. Okay. That was

982
04:25:22,579 --> 04:25:28,639
good. You got two points. Uh, we're going to do some mischief here.

983
04:25:31,120 --> 04:25:40,540
Wash. That's so rude.

984
04:25:44,770 --> 04:26:02,340
That was so rude. The urn is ugly. Um, what do you want me to do? I can't sell it. Come on.

985
04:26:02,340 --> 04:26:17,819
Come on. I don't want this 30 FPS. Come on. Come on. Stop it. Stop it. There we go.

986
04:26:22,610 --> 04:26:27,620
All right. So we, what time is it? Seven o'clock. Let's get ready for bed and let's ready to go out

987
04:26:27,620 --> 04:26:40,219
and have fun on New Year's Eve. So you need to go to the bathroom. Sure. Why not? Then go to bed.

988
04:26:40,860 --> 04:26:56,219
What is a feral poop? Doesn't seem very feral. How about you? You need to eat. Uh, I made.

989
04:26:57,180 --> 04:26:58,219
Yeah, you can eat the leftovers.

990
04:27:04,209 --> 04:27:11,500
Eat the leftovers. What are you doing? Um, well, you need to cook it first.

991
04:27:12,059 --> 04:27:36,559
You're just going to eat raw meat. What? You better not throw that away.

992
04:27:46,989 --> 04:28:27,760
Why is he eating raw steak? There's no stove. Fix that. Stop lagging. It's annoying. All right.

993
04:28:31,569 --> 04:28:43,500
So we have stove again. Uh, what's wrong with you? Yeah. Go to the bathroom. Cook the steak this time.

994
04:28:43,500 --> 04:28:59,500
What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?

995
04:28:59,500 --> 04:29:09,100
Stop that. Don't eat the raw meat. Stop doing that. Why is he doing this? Cook it. There's a

996
04:29:09,100 --> 04:29:27,379
stove. Cook it right. Cook it. You know what? Just eat it. Whatever. He's not a werewolf. He is.

997
04:29:27,379 --> 04:30:00,030
Go to bed. That snowman's been there for a long time. Carnivore diet. Oh no, you're starting to

998
04:30:00,030 --> 04:30:08,700
turn. No more of raw meat. What do we do? Would I take a cold shower or bath or something? He's

999
04:30:08,700 --> 04:30:16,340
doing this thing again. How do we stop it? Oh, he's going hunting. All right. Well, whatever. Fine.

1000
04:30:16,340 --> 04:30:24,750
Bring back some meat. Um, it's almost time for you to get up. Wait, what? He already has it?

1001
04:30:25,389 --> 04:30:36,209
Oh my God. He's got four. No, no, no. We need to cook these steaks. I need to learn how to make a

1002
04:30:36,209 --> 04:30:50,020
steak. These two are fucked. I'm going to eat raw meat at the New Year's Eve party and scare the

1003
04:30:50,020 --> 04:31:06,959
shit out of everybody there. Okay. Uh, how are you on sleep? All right. Get up. Let's get prepared

1004
04:31:06,959 --> 04:31:17,600
for the day. Time for New Year's Eve. Can they cook something? What are you making? Garden salads.

1005
04:31:17,600 --> 04:31:44,559
Not that. Okay. Well, whatever. That's fine. The dancing is making him turn. That's enough of that.

1006
04:31:44,559 --> 04:31:56,350
How do we, how do I calm them down? How do I calm me down? Practice singing or something?

1007
04:32:09,200 --> 04:32:14,799
So bored. All right. New Year's Eve. Let's go. Oh, God damn it. Really? Okay. Well, whatever.

1008
04:32:14,799 --> 04:32:38,450
Should I not take them out? Three hours. What are you doing? We just need to just ride this out

1009
04:32:38,450 --> 04:32:55,889
for another couple of hours. It's going to be fine. Go hunt now. Oh, that's a good idea. I can't.

1010
04:32:58,940 --> 04:33:01,500
No, I can't. I've lost all control currently.

1011
04:33:06,299 --> 04:33:15,150
Don't fuck this whole thing up. Just, I need just six of AM, seven, eight, nine AM, right?

1012
04:33:15,150 --> 04:34:08,990
Do not. This guy. Gary T is the worst character. Are you done? This guy sucks. Eat anything.

1013
04:34:09,549 --> 04:34:34,819
I'm going to eat the coffee machine. Oh my God. What else can I eat? All right. You're coming down.

1014
04:34:34,819 --> 04:34:43,650
Stop peeing. All right. He's coming down. He's coming down. All right. There he goes.

1015
04:34:45,759 --> 04:34:56,049
You ready to go to New Year's Eve? Let's go pee and we'll go. That's such a weird thing because

1016
04:34:56,049 --> 04:35:06,590
this is all official. This is all official Sims 4 shit. That's not a mod. This is the werewolf

1017
04:35:06,590 --> 04:35:13,439
stuff is officially in the game. I almost feel like this is still the mod. It's not. Okay.

1018
04:35:14,000 --> 04:35:25,950
Are we ready? It's time to go to a New Year's Eve party. Where are we going to do it? Countdown to

1019
04:35:25,950 --> 04:35:30,509
midnight decorate party spirit. We're going to go. We have to go somewhere. Where are we going?

1020
04:35:30,509 --> 04:35:45,009
New Year's Eve. Let's plan a social event. Let's go. All right. This is going to be a

1021
04:35:47,979 --> 04:35:51,419
mountain climb excursion on New Year's Eve. We're going to get to the top of the mountain and

1022
04:35:51,419 --> 04:36:03,299
everyone's going to make their resolution on top of the mountain. I only know two people.

1023
04:36:04,099 --> 04:36:22,819
How do we only know two? I've killed people, right? Whatever. This is going to be cool.

1024
04:36:22,819 --> 04:36:45,630
He actually did come with. Wait, he hates me, but he doesn't hate you. He doesn't. All right.

1025
04:36:45,630 --> 04:36:56,750
When did we get to the top of the mountain? Gather excursion members near the trail map

1026
04:36:56,750 --> 04:37:08,099
marker at the top of the climbing route. All right. Where's the climbing route? Over here.

1027
04:37:08,099 --> 04:37:22,500
Okay. Have a sim perform any exercise to warm up. Oh, don't do anything weird. Don't do werewolf

1028
04:37:22,500 --> 04:37:33,090
shit. Stop. Why do I have my clothes off? Oh, okay. Is this also somebody that's going to come with

1029
04:37:33,090 --> 04:37:45,250
us? No, no, no. Don't leave. Oh, you're not leaving. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We have

1030
04:37:45,250 --> 04:37:56,529
to go together. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't go without us. We have to go together.

1031
04:37:56,529 --> 04:38:04,340
What are you doing? Don't just go on your own. Okay. I need to do, we need to do an exercise.

1032
04:38:04,900 --> 04:38:19,259
Hurry up. Uh, is it like dog here or something? I don't have anything. All right. Well, whatever.

1033
04:38:19,259 --> 04:38:28,880
Let's go. Okay. Gather excursion members near the trail. Oh, climb up rock wall. Let's go guys.

1034
04:38:29,759 --> 04:38:59,439
Let's check it out. Wrong way. This is a filler episode. Why? How do I get it? Excursion members

1035
04:39:00,080 --> 04:39:15,599
trail map marker at the top of the climbing route. Where is that? This is not canon ride to the top.

1036
04:39:18,799 --> 04:39:31,860
Check the board board. What do you mean? Like in here? God damn it. I want to go on the rock

1037
04:39:31,860 --> 04:39:45,860
climb. The yellow board. You mean this over here? Where's this yellow board you're talking about?

1038
04:39:45,860 --> 04:39:54,419
The yellow board. Where's the yellow board? Who is, who is this?

1039
04:40:09,889 --> 04:40:19,939
All right. We're going up. Ride to the top. All right. Here we go.

1040
04:40:19,939 --> 04:40:40,779
We're going to the top of the mountain. That's who just wiped out. Who just climbed a rock wall?

1041
04:40:42,130 --> 04:41:26,819
I didn't do that. Where is everybody? Where the, where are you going? Santa already got up somehow.

1042
04:41:26,819 --> 04:41:58,029
How did you do that? I need climbing gear. He doesn't have any climbing gear on.

1043
04:41:58,029 --> 04:42:35,939
I need climbing gear from any computer. Hold on. Can I, from here? I definitely can't, right?

1044
04:42:35,939 --> 04:43:16,380
No, I can't reach him. He's saying I can't do it. Santa I think has to pee. I can't reach with

1045
04:43:16,380 --> 04:43:48,180
anything. He's just taunting me. No, I can't do it. How is he going to get down is the question.

1046
04:43:54,529 --> 04:44:05,700
He's so stupid. This is stupid. Santa gets up there with no class. How do I get, what do I do here?

1047
04:44:05,700 --> 04:44:27,299
I guess I could, um, I want to, I just want him to, I'm not going to suffocate him with a diaper.

1048
04:44:27,299 --> 04:44:37,680
I can't reach him. I can't suffocate him with a diaper. With flamethrower. No, he's safe up there.

1049
04:44:37,680 --> 04:45:09,200
I can't do anything about it. Artillery. There's no, I don't have artillery. Drop a meteor, run

1050
04:45:09,200 --> 04:45:16,560
him over. I can't. The group wasn't prepared for the climb. They showed up at the mountain.

1051
04:45:18,720 --> 04:45:27,040
Where did he go? Where did he go? Where's Santa? That was weird.

1052
04:45:42,180 --> 04:46:06,720
He's going. Damn, all right. Well, he made it. He actually made it. I have no idea where Santa went.

1053
04:46:06,720 --> 04:46:15,459
That was bizarre. All right, now we're gonna, I'm gonna ride to the bottom. I just wasn't prepared

1054
04:46:15,459 --> 04:46:22,130
for this apparently. I didn't know you had to have a climbing skill. I guess it's a new skill

1055
04:46:22,130 --> 04:46:43,540
because I was building a meter. Hey, fancy some, um, okay. Pony deserves better than Jerry.

1056
04:46:43,540 --> 04:47:02,689
Let's go get some tea. Okay, so we're all here. Santa here too. All right, so drink tea.

1057
04:47:06,020 --> 04:47:27,779
Where's the, how do I get tea? All right, let's go get Sakura tea. It's right here. Get some swag.

1058
04:47:28,419 --> 04:47:53,389
All right, so what do we want? You didn't even take, you didn't drink your tea.

1059
04:47:54,110 --> 04:48:08,180
We all good? All right, look at how old he is.

1060
04:48:11,299 --> 04:48:15,380
It was just yesterday, I feel like, when I tried to poison you. Here you are.

1061
04:48:28,720 --> 04:48:31,409
Finished the job?

1062
04:48:38,080 --> 04:48:41,840
No, I, no, no, that's not, that's not what we're doing.

1063
04:48:41,840 --> 04:48:43,680
I'm going to drink this tea. We're gonna have a good time.

1064
04:48:44,159 --> 04:48:59,970
Okay, B. I thought I drank the tea. Did I not? Where's my tea? Why can I not get it?

1065
04:49:01,419 --> 04:49:18,659
Drink it. Finally. Jesus. All right, we're good. It's freaking me out. Okay. Why?

1066
04:49:27,250 --> 04:49:48,060
What are you doing over here? So wait, it's almost New Year's, right? We have to sing.

1067
04:49:48,779 --> 04:50:05,090
You think he's gonna like raw meat? Hey, Jeffrey. Brought you something.

1068
04:50:06,049 --> 04:50:08,450
It's a stinky raw steak.

1069
04:50:12,450 --> 04:50:15,299
What?

1070
04:50:27,150 --> 04:50:38,060
I have no idea what just happened. What, what, what was, who was going where?

1071
04:50:39,630 --> 04:50:42,750
I don't understand what I was watching. Oh, that was cool.

1072
04:51:00,560 --> 04:51:03,819
I want to do a New Year's Eve. Let's blow some horns.

1073
04:51:16,740 --> 04:51:19,060
I feel like I'm in VR chat right now.

1074
04:51:38,830 --> 04:51:42,540
Discuss being a werewolf. The metaverse.

1075
04:51:42,939 --> 04:52:47,419
He's his spirit is fading away. Oh my goodness, man. That was a lot into my own piss.

1076
04:52:51,650 --> 04:52:58,720
He made a splashing sound. Um, uh, let's wake up here.

1077
04:53:13,869 --> 04:53:18,509
Is that a big cigar? Oh no. Wait.

1078
04:53:19,470 --> 04:53:22,189
That he's trying to kill a werewolves and vampires.

1079
04:53:33,759 --> 04:53:36,180
I should stay away from this guy.

1080
04:53:44,060 --> 04:53:54,819
I want to see what he says. If I go over there, I'm going to be really werewolfy in front of them.

1081
04:53:55,459 --> 04:54:01,220
Oh, they hate me.

1082
04:54:36,779 --> 04:54:38,060
This is so stupid.

1083
04:54:38,060 --> 04:55:01,009
I'm going to hunt for food right now. Where would I even hunt for food is my question.

1084
04:55:34,909 --> 04:55:37,630
It's kind of hard to move here. I'm having a little bit of trouble moving.

1085
04:55:44,639 --> 04:55:48,700
There's no other werewolves here. That's bullshit.

1086
04:56:09,419 --> 04:56:14,099
I'm going to eat the karaoke machine. I'm going to eat the table that I'm sitting at too.

1087
04:56:14,099 --> 04:56:42,799
The person's a fan. Oh, I destroyed it all.

1088
04:56:42,799 --> 04:57:16,560
Somebody said, please, can you make one sane character?

1089
04:57:16,560 --> 04:57:26,529
I think this character is pretty sane actually. Prime werewolf?

1090
04:57:26,529 --> 04:58:13,409
Oh my God. That's scary. What am I doing? I think everyone's leaving.

1091
04:58:13,409 --> 04:58:17,950
All right. All right. All right. Let's finish this up.

1092
04:58:25,540 --> 04:58:33,340
That lady just put that gun. Oh my, that was awful.

1093
04:58:34,380 --> 04:58:41,790
Where'd the table go? What?

1094
04:58:44,880 --> 04:59:02,770
Where am I? Oh, okay. How you doing?

1095
04:59:06,830 --> 04:59:12,020
Oh, you just did that. You just did that to me.

1096
04:59:30,380 --> 04:59:31,020
All right, we're good.

1097
04:59:40,130 --> 04:59:44,450
Everyone's so sad. It's all about who died. What death? It's all about death.

1098
04:59:47,250 --> 04:59:48,610
Somebody died?

1099
05:00:09,540 --> 05:00:13,459
Well, that's okay. It's the people that I killed. Why did I do that?

1100
05:00:13,459 --> 05:00:19,360
All right. Let's go home. Back to the house.

1101
05:00:20,380 --> 05:00:22,939
That was a wait. We didn't even count down the new year.

1102
05:00:22,939 --> 05:00:29,759
Oh, well, just pretend we did. Just pretend we did. That's fine.

1103
05:00:46,909 --> 05:00:55,220
Jerry ruins the another holiday. Okay. Back here.

1104
05:00:55,220 --> 05:00:58,540
So if you're curious what we're doing tomorrow, tomorrow I'm streaming.

1105
05:00:58,540 --> 05:01:02,939
Tomorrow is obviously Thanksgiving if you celebrate it.

1106
05:01:02,939 --> 05:01:06,299
Probably going to start the stream a little bit later in the day

1107
05:01:08,049 --> 05:01:14,110
because I figured people will be, you know, eat your turkey,

1108
05:01:14,110 --> 05:01:17,580
have your stuffing and Thanksgiving. And then later on in the evening,

1109
05:01:18,139 --> 05:01:33,709
guess what came out three days ago? Hatsune Miku Picross.

1110
05:01:33,709 --> 05:01:38,700
Hatsune Miku Picross is out. So we're going to chill, eat your food.

1111
05:01:39,650 --> 05:01:43,439
We'll hang out for a few hours tomorrow evening on Thanksgiving.

1112
05:01:43,439 --> 05:01:48,020
It'll be a chill stream. There's been a few wild ones here.

1113
05:01:48,020 --> 05:01:55,709
So chill it out. That's the plan. Are we all in the house?

1114
05:01:55,709 --> 05:01:56,909
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Good. Good. Good.

1115
05:01:56,909 --> 05:02:02,000
I'm playing it for a few days. Is it any good?

1116
05:02:14,259 --> 05:02:15,540
I'm not going to the flea market. I don't care.

1117
05:02:24,459 --> 05:02:26,380
Turn this off. I don't like having that there.

1118
05:02:28,369 --> 05:02:33,970
OP. Go on. It's Picross. So it's fun. Cool.

1119
05:02:33,970 --> 05:02:37,419
Does it play music? I would imagine it probably does.

1120
05:02:41,360 --> 05:02:47,380
Oh yeah. Let me just say one more time before I start to cool it out here.

1121
05:02:47,380 --> 05:02:50,740
If you want to nominate something, the end of the year awards,

1122
05:02:50,740 --> 05:02:54,099
nominations are open as of right this very moment.

1123
05:02:54,099 --> 05:02:58,099
Go to the Discord. Go check the nominations channel.

1124
05:02:58,099 --> 05:03:04,130
Read the rules. It's going to be, the nominations are open until December 4th.

1125
05:03:04,130 --> 05:03:07,060
After December 4th, if you don't know what happens here,

1126
05:03:07,060 --> 05:03:09,139
I would go check the previous, the fifth year running.

1127
05:03:10,819 --> 05:03:14,880
Go watch the previous awards, skim through, see kind of what it's all about.

1128
05:03:14,959 --> 05:03:16,560
We do a best and worst of the channel.

1129
05:03:21,520 --> 05:03:25,119
And it will be not on New Year's this year.

1130
05:03:25,119 --> 05:03:29,439
We're doing it in December. Should be a really fun time.

1131
05:03:29,439 --> 05:03:30,959
It's going to be a Christmas special.

1132
05:03:33,310 --> 05:03:35,630
If you have something, if you look at that category's list,

1133
05:03:35,630 --> 05:03:41,069
go look. You might have something to nominate.

1134
05:03:41,069 --> 05:03:42,270
And I'm going to probably call it here.

1135
05:03:44,099 --> 05:03:52,720
I feel like these two characters are, they're just a little too fucked up.

1136
05:03:52,720 --> 05:03:58,880
So I'm probably going to call it here in a second.

1137
05:03:58,880 --> 05:04:01,040
You learn how to make an egg and toast BLT.

1138
05:04:01,040 --> 05:04:03,069
What the hell are you, what is that?

1139
05:04:03,069 --> 05:04:09,740
I'm going to save it though, because we'll come back probably.

1140
05:04:09,740 --> 05:04:11,979
This is, these games are so much fun with the mods.

1141
05:04:11,979 --> 05:04:16,770
It's just, I know that if I have the ability to do this, for instance, like,

1142
05:04:16,770 --> 05:04:19,840
what's one that we didn't see that I want to see?

1143
05:04:19,840 --> 05:04:27,810
There's only those two.

1144
05:04:37,459 --> 05:04:38,099
Steal money.

1145
05:04:43,229 --> 05:04:45,150
No, I'm not clicking on some of these.

1146
05:04:46,580 --> 05:04:52,860
Okay, so what about, I want to look at Deadly.

1147
05:04:52,860 --> 05:04:54,220
Bash head with axe.

1148
05:04:54,220 --> 05:04:55,180
Burn with flamethrower.

1149
05:04:55,180 --> 05:04:56,220
Chainsaw guts.

1150
05:04:59,330 --> 05:05:02,139
Death from above.

1151
05:05:02,139 --> 05:05:04,189
What does this mean?

1152
05:05:04,189 --> 05:05:05,630
I'm going to be on a motorcycle?

1153
05:05:06,939 --> 05:05:09,759
I need to know what this does.

1154
05:05:09,759 --> 05:05:10,639
He's getting out of bed.

1155
05:05:10,639 --> 05:05:11,040
Oh no.

1156
05:05:31,810 --> 05:05:33,729
That was a little elaborate.

1157
05:05:34,610 --> 05:05:35,889
That was a little too much.

1158
05:05:41,389 --> 05:05:41,889
Okay.

1159
05:05:45,520 --> 05:05:46,400
Stop killing Sims.

1160
05:05:46,400 --> 05:05:52,849
I don't have all day.

1161
05:05:52,849 --> 05:05:53,810
I saved it right before.

1162
05:05:53,810 --> 05:05:54,310
Don't worry.

1163
05:06:06,400 --> 05:06:13,779
Lead.

1164
05:06:13,779 --> 05:06:14,279
Come on.

1165
05:06:19,380 --> 05:06:22,099
He's been brought back to life.

1166
05:06:23,360 --> 05:06:23,860
Very cool.

1167
05:07:07,709 --> 05:07:08,830
Brought back again?

1168
05:07:09,869 --> 05:07:10,830
Oh my God.

1169
05:07:11,549 --> 05:07:14,860
He's back.

1170
05:07:15,759 --> 05:07:16,479
We're all good.

1171
05:07:31,979 --> 05:07:33,580
Tombstone Piledriver?

1172
05:07:33,580 --> 05:07:34,540
What is that?

1173
05:07:34,540 --> 05:07:52,419
That is so stupid.

1174
05:07:52,419 --> 05:08:47,810
It plays the music too.

1175
05:08:47,810 --> 05:08:49,409
He's still alive.

1176
05:08:49,409 --> 05:08:52,979
How is he still alive?

1177
05:08:52,979 --> 05:08:54,180
Oh shit.

1178
05:08:54,180 --> 05:08:54,819
Oh shit.

1179
05:08:54,819 --> 05:08:55,220
Quickly.

1180
05:08:55,220 --> 05:08:55,939
Hurry.

1181
05:08:55,939 --> 05:09:09,569
Cat, get out of the way.

1182
05:09:09,569 --> 05:09:10,689
Cat, get out of the way.

1183
05:09:10,689 --> 05:09:11,810
Cat, get out of the way.

1184
05:09:11,810 --> 05:09:12,930
Cat, get out of the way.

1185
05:09:12,930 --> 05:09:13,729
Why am I bald?

1186
05:09:13,729 --> 05:09:14,849
Where's my hair?

1187
05:09:14,849 --> 05:09:26,479
Okay.

1188
05:09:26,479 --> 05:09:30,290
I just want to see.

1189
05:09:42,369 --> 05:09:54,610
Wait.

1190
05:09:54,610 --> 05:09:57,419
Death took my jupe?

1191
05:09:58,799 --> 05:09:59,919
He ripped my...

1192
05:09:59,919 --> 05:10:08,689
What?

1193
05:10:08,689 --> 05:10:09,970
Let's have some raw meat.

1194
05:10:12,930 --> 05:10:17,790
Where's the cat?

1195
05:10:17,790 --> 05:10:18,830
Oh, cat's fine.

1196
05:10:18,830 --> 05:10:35,580
That's been fun.

1197
05:10:35,580 --> 05:10:51,520
We've completely gone off the rails though, unfortunately.

1198
05:10:51,520 --> 05:10:52,400
Thanks for watching everybody.

1199
05:10:52,400 --> 05:10:57,200
That's gonna be it.

1200
05:10:57,200 --> 05:10:58,479
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

1201
05:10:58,479 --> 05:11:01,169
Have a good Thanksgiving if you celebrate it.

1202
05:11:01,169 --> 05:11:04,849
That was the...

1203
05:11:37,200 --> 05:11:53,790
All right, that's it.

1204
05:11:53,790 --> 05:11:55,810
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

1205
05:11:55,810 --> 05:12:02,880
I'll see you guys tomorrow for Miku Picross.

1206
05:12:02,880 --> 05:12:04,400
Probably somewhere around...

1207
05:12:04,400 --> 05:12:05,729
What's a good time?

1208
05:12:05,729 --> 05:12:10,450
Maybe like later in the night?

1209
05:12:10,450 --> 05:12:12,049
Just like a chill night stream?

1210
05:12:12,049 --> 05:12:16,509
I think that sounds like a good idea.

1211
05:12:16,509 --> 05:12:19,540
Maybe like 5, 6 p.m. Pacific?

1212
05:12:19,540 --> 05:12:20,659
6 p.m. Pacific?

1213
05:12:20,659 --> 05:12:24,180
Have like a late night just chill Picross stream for a little bit?

1214
05:12:24,180 --> 05:12:25,459
Line down from Thanksgiving?

1215
05:12:25,459 --> 05:12:28,689
That sounds like a plan to me.

1216
05:12:28,689 --> 05:12:33,869
So see you tomorrow at 6 p.m.

1217
05:12:33,869 --> 05:12:35,419
Late night.

1218
05:12:35,419 --> 05:12:38,529
Thanks everybody for watching.

1219
05:12:38,529 --> 05:12:40,689
Again, this has been The Sims 4.

1220
05:12:40,689 --> 05:12:41,569
We'll probably play it again.

1221
05:12:43,790 --> 05:12:44,430
We just kind of...

1222
05:12:44,990 --> 05:12:46,110
It just went off the rails.

1223
05:12:46,110 --> 05:12:51,840
And actually I'm getting hungry so I'm gonna go eat some food.

1224
05:12:51,840 --> 05:12:53,119
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

1225
05:12:53,759 --> 05:12:54,799
Happy Thanksgiving.

1226
05:12:54,799 --> 05:12:55,759
Have a good one.

1227
05:12:57,810 --> 05:12:58,310
Goodbye.

1228
05:12:59,259 --> 05:12:59,819
Good night.

1229
05:13:00,380 --> 05:13:02,740
Thanks for watching.

1230
05:13:02,740 --> 05:13:03,459
Thanks for the support.

1231
05:13:05,659 --> 05:13:07,819
There were a ton of subs today so thanks guys.

1232
05:13:07,819 --> 05:13:08,700
Appreciate it.

1233
05:13:08,700 --> 05:13:13,119
And we'll see you tomorrow.

1234
05:13:19,360 --> 05:13:20,319
Please play Sorcery.

1235
05:13:21,700 --> 05:13:23,060
What about your internet dropping it?

1236
05:13:23,060 --> 05:13:24,180
Oh, that's a good point.

1237
05:13:27,759 --> 05:13:28,560
It's Picross.

1238
05:13:29,200 --> 05:13:38,259
There's not much going on on the screen.

1239
05:13:38,259 --> 05:13:41,380
Even if I drop some frames it's not very much going on bitrate-wise.

1240
05:13:42,020 --> 05:13:52,419
Sorcery?

1241
05:13:52,419 --> 05:13:52,979
Yes.

1242
05:13:52,979 --> 05:13:53,220
So...

1243
05:13:53,860 --> 05:13:54,750
I don't know.

1244
05:13:54,750 --> 05:13:57,150
We kind of need to figure out what's going to happen with that.

1245
05:13:57,869 --> 05:14:01,630
I did say that I would get into the third game and see if I was still into it.

1246
05:14:01,630 --> 05:14:02,830
See how people are into it.

1247
05:14:02,830 --> 05:14:08,220
Maybe we'll do some just chill late night streams or something.

1248
05:14:08,220 --> 05:14:08,939
Get some of it done.

1249
05:14:09,659 --> 05:14:16,060
Breath of the Wild?

1250
05:14:16,060 --> 05:14:18,060
Oh, we played Breath of the Wild a few days ago.

1251
05:14:18,700 --> 05:14:19,979
I'm still into it.

1252
05:14:30,750 --> 05:14:32,029
Please play more Sorcery.

1253
05:14:33,869 --> 05:14:35,790
What date is the actual award stream?

1254
05:14:35,790 --> 05:14:37,470
I don't have a hard date for you.

1255
05:14:38,189 --> 05:14:39,790
But I can tell you it will be...

1256
05:14:41,490 --> 05:14:42,689
It will be near...

1257
05:14:42,689 --> 05:14:43,970
It'll be before Christmas.

1258
05:14:44,610 --> 05:14:48,849
It'll be at least a few days.

1259
05:14:48,849 --> 05:14:51,790
At least three or four days before Christmas.

1260
05:14:51,790 --> 05:14:52,669
That I can assure you.

1261
05:14:53,229 --> 05:15:01,419
But see you tomorrow.

1262
05:15:01,419 --> 05:15:02,139
Have a good Thanksgiving.

1263
05:15:02,139 --> 05:15:02,619
Good night.

1264
05:15:02,619 --> 05:15:03,259
See you guys later.

1265
05:15:06,459 --> 05:15:08,220
Again, the awards are open.

1266
05:15:08,220 --> 05:15:09,340
Nominations are open.

1267
05:15:09,340 --> 05:15:11,340
If you think that's something you wanted to keep,

1268
05:15:11,340 --> 05:15:15,259
you want to make sure that you made the nomination aware.

1269
05:15:15,259 --> 05:15:15,659
Go do it.

1270
05:15:15,659 --> 05:15:16,220
It's in Discord.

1271
05:15:16,220 --> 05:15:17,580
There's a channel in Discord right now.

1272
05:15:18,139 --> 05:15:20,430
radobeasts.net

1273
05:15:20,430 --> 05:15:21,549
Go check that out too.

1274
05:15:21,549 --> 05:15:22,509
That's very close.

1275
05:15:23,069 --> 05:15:24,189
If you haven't checked it out,

1276
05:15:24,189 --> 05:15:25,630
haven't signed up already,

1277
05:15:25,630 --> 05:15:29,500
it's a great way for us to understand how many units we actually really need.

1278
05:15:30,459 --> 05:15:31,740
radobeasts.net

1279
05:15:34,270 --> 05:15:35,869
End of the year award nominations.

1280
05:15:36,509 --> 05:15:37,729
Christmas show.

1281
05:15:38,529 --> 05:15:39,169
Battleaxe.

1282
05:15:39,729 --> 05:15:42,380
Quite a few things going on in the next month or two.

1283
05:15:42,380 --> 05:15:44,689
So see you soon.

1284
05:15:45,409 --> 05:15:45,889
Take care.

1285
05:15:46,529 --> 05:15:47,889
Have a good rest of your night.

1286
05:15:47,889 --> 05:15:49,419
See you guys later.

1287
05:15:49,419 --> 05:17:18,979
Call your mother.
