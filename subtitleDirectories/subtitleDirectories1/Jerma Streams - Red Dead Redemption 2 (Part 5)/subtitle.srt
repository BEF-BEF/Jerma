1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:08,710
Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait hold on explain this to me. How can how can I be late

2
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:16,570
if I don't have a schedule right now? How can I be late if there's no time that I'm supposed to show

3
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:34,280
up? That doesn't make very much logical sense. Sorry I just had to flush a toilet, look weird.

4
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,119
Need to change my offline image. Yeah I'm I think I'm just going to delete it.

5
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:44,409
I haven't saved. I'm going to update it. Just haven't been like that's one of those things.

6
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:53,060
that's like leaving a bottle of water on your desk or in your kitchen you know

7
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,759
I'm talking about you just leave and a half drank bottle of water is just

8
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:02,359
sitting in the same spot in the kitchen for like a week and you see it every day

9
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:07,540
and you're looking at it and you're like ah I don't know and you walk away from

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:20,560
it I do that but with like five bottles yeah that it's just like a water bottle

11
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,439
like I see it every day and I'm like should I need to I need like I need to

12
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:36,739
move now whatever I'll see you tomorrow right down the cereal box stream no that

13
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:45,640
was real mr. was mr. mr. Dunwich right I'm gonna give credit where credit is due

14
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:54,390
came up with an amazing idea and I think we're gonna do it so here's the here's

15
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,620
the before we get started I gotta just tell you about this brilliant idea so

16
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:03,099
you know the cereal box puzzles that are on the back of every cereal box well not

17
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:08,000
really anymore that was a thing back in like they still do it but not really

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,280
like they used to every inch of your cereal box back when it been like the

19
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,479
mid-90s was a puzzle little like ladders and things to play with and crosswords

20
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:23,680
and now that's like nutritional information you know me like not

21
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,319
nowadays on the back of the box it's like well all whole grains and no trans

22
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,280
vats get that shit out of here I want the puzzles back I want to I want to

23
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:42,039
fucking like find the five cuckoo birds nobody everyone knows cereal is just

24
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:46,960
dogshit with fucking vitamins injected into it you know what I mean like what

25
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,120
you don't eat a bowl of fucking Captain Crunch and go like oh I'm so glad I'm

26
00:02:50,120 --> 00:03:07,759
getting my daily C no that's not how it works anyways hi how's everybody doing

27
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:13,360
we're gonna play some more Red Dead today cuz I am officially addicted to

28
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,280
the game and I think it's very fun and I have the strict policy on this live

29
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:26,159
stream very strict policy of if I'm having fun doing something I'm gonna do

30
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:32,050
it and we're about to break the four streams in a row well actually no that's

31
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:37,250
not true because lethal but I played lethal league for about four hours so

32
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,569
then I never might so this this is like the second Red Dead stream in a row

33
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:47,199
right I don't usually stream the same game more than four or five times in a

34
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:54,270
row so it is still technically legal what's the brilliant idea well anyway so

35
00:03:54,270 --> 00:04:01,229
what I want to do which was very nicely suggested to me is I'm going to go on

36
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:07,870
eBay and Amazon and maybe find some old retailers and I'm gonna get like 30

37
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:12,909
boxes of cereal and we're gonna do the puzzles on the stream and we're gonna go

38
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:22,360
over our favorite ones which one had the most challenging puzzle this is I'm

39
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,670
gonna fill my room with cereal and we're gonna go one by one we might even do a

40
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:30,850
thing we're okay like Cocoa Puffs here's like a Cocoa Puffs box from like 1990

41
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:37,069
this is gonna hold on a minute this is gonna cost like 10 grand how like okay

42
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:49,120
Cocoa Puffs like old box or something right can I like buy this okay here's

43
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:55,600
one empty General Mills cereal box 2009 Cocoa Puffs 2011 yeah oh yeah these are

44
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:04,329
ten bucks though it's gonna cost ten dollars to buy an empty fucking cereal

45
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:13,540
box from 2007 something about that is just seems not worth it that's buying

46
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:19,980
someone's trash that is buying a person's trash out of their trash can for

47
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:28,449
an exorbitant price ten dollars really that's like come on man that's a little

48
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:41,759
much just make your own puzzles it's $20 for one from 1990 it's this no shame and

49
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:50,720
just finding pictures of it all online oh fuck you're right that's true you

50
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,639
don't have to buy the boxes but I don't but then I have to eat the cereal right

51
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:03,220
and that how it works don't I also then need to eat it and test which puzzles

52
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:11,149
which year was the best can you eat cereal from like 1990 what happens if

53
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:24,459
you eat cereal from like 1992 it's pretty bad well yeah at least I'll get

54
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:35,569
my daily C that's correct oh man that's a funny idea though anyways um yes I'm

55
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:42,399
we're just I just want to play Red Dead and I'm here last thing we did if you're

56
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:47,160
curious if you have no idea we just got the bear we just got the bear by the

57
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,319

59
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:09,149
screen already but now we have this the funny definitely guaranteed every

60
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:13,509
streamer you watch every single one that comes across this hat will wear it

61

guaranteed if this is like the streamer hat isn't it isn't it it's a cool hat

62
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:39,680
oh you dropped some frames oh it was too good to be true we had three days in a

63
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:47,199
row perfect internet it was too good to be true

64
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,560
clean your piece for oh I think it really might have been too good to be

65
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:59,360
true I may it may have been too good to be true is it possible was it too good

66
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:13,459
to be true it looks pretty rough right now we'll see we'll see we'll see if it

67
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:39,159
strains itself out quick throw salt over your shoulder I know really okay okay

68
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:45,490
those are the consequences of streaming last night for ten hours I know really

69
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:58,899
well we're gonna see how what happens so welcome and goodbye potentially hasn't

70

535
01:54:17,239 --> 01:54:25,229
strawberry let's do I think someone's been on here for so long is it I think

536
01:54:25,229 --> 01:54:41,020
is it time to do Micah learning how to read I think it's time it's time so I'm

537
01:54:41,020 --> 01:54:50,359
gonna take down or up is there the stagecoach here looks like probably

go down here we're gonna do this and then we're gonna go to GR okay forget

540
01:55:02,199 --> 01:55:11,239
everything I just said he's been down there for a long time you know sometimes

541
01:55:11,239 --> 01:55:21,069
you gotta wait I mean like when Sakurai delayed Smash Brothers brawl three

542
01:55:21,069 --> 01:55:32,359
months back in like 2008 it was worth waiting I think it's time to change on

543
01:55:32,359 --> 01:55:49,319
horses to whispers getting a little tired brawl did they delay brawl yeah

544
01:55:49,319 --> 01:55:54,159
like three times they delayed brawl at least two or three times

545
01:55:54,159 --> 01:56:08,689
turn this way I wouldn't say the brawl was the best smash game I would say the

546
01:56:08,689 --> 01:56:16,090
brawl was the most anticipated smash game that of all of them that have been

547
01:56:16,090 --> 01:56:39,050
made so far I would say that that's just shooting with my horse girl come here

548
01:56:39,050 --> 01:56:48,140
you don't get an accident with somebody and start shooting them I did not

549

I just couldn't face that he was gone

596
02:01:47,140 --> 02:01:49,140
I was teaching Sammy

597
02:01:49,140 --> 02:01:51,140
how to hold the rifle proper

598
02:01:51,140 --> 02:01:54,399
out by the river

599
02:01:54,399 --> 02:01:56,399
the recoil

600
02:01:56,399 --> 02:02:01,520
shot him backwards

601
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:04,850
he slipped into the river

602
02:02:04,850 --> 02:02:06,850
the water pulled him downstream

603
02:02:06,850 --> 02:02:09,220
so quick

604
02:02:09,220 --> 02:02:11,220
it all happened so fast

605
02:02:11,220 --> 02:02:14,289
I didn't know what to do

606
02:02:14,289 --> 02:02:16,289
I searched up and down that river bank

607
02:02:16,289 --> 02:02:18,289
for days

608
02:02:18,289 --> 02:02:21,109
but I couldn't find my boy

609
02:02:21,109 --> 02:02:23,109

02:02:23,109 --> 02:02:25,600

643
02:04:56,359 --> 02:04:59,430

651
02:05:27,159 --> 02:05:29,159
it's going to be like

652
02:05:29,159 --> 02:05:31,159
remember in the end of the Scrooge McDuck movie

653
02:05:31,159 --> 02:05:33,159
when the guy had the pants filled with the coins

654
02:05:33,159 --> 02:05:38,470
look at all this shit

655
02:05:38,470 --> 02:05:46,279

02:05:53,189 --> 02:06:01,119
Black Friday

02:06:01,119 --> 02:06:03,119
this guy's not going to have any inventory left

659
02:06:03,119 --> 02:06:05,119
it's not going to matter where he's going

660
02:06:05,119 --> 02:06:12,479
everything must go

661
02:06:12,479 --> 02:06:14,479
any weapon on the walls

662
02:06:14,479 --> 02:06:27,479
I don't care what it is, it's mine

663
02:06:27,479 --> 02:06:29,479
I'm never going to have to purchase bullets ever again

664
02:06:29,479 --> 02:06:32,930
they're worth a dollar each?

665
02:06:32,930 --> 02:06:34,930
yeah but when you take 50 of them

666
02:06:34,930 --> 02:06:40,289

667
02:06:40,289 --> 02:06:42,289

actually I have to do two dollar bets because the achievement

854
02:21:21,760 --> 02:21:23,760
is to double down

855
02:21:23,760 --> 02:21:28,049
I have to be ready for that

856
02:21:28,049 --> 02:21:30,680

857
02:21:30,680 --> 02:21:32,680

split against a three

867
02:22:00,450 --> 02:22:02,450
maybe if you had like a five or six

868
02:22:02,450 --> 02:22:05,270

869
02:22:13,489 --> 02:22:15,489

you know you can't you double down on a twenty

874
02:22:26,469 --> 02:22:29,219
you get another card

875
02:22:29,219 --> 02:22:31,219
you'll just you're guaranteed to lose

876
02:22:31,219 --> 02:22:37,489
you can't split against a three

877
02:22:40,559 --> 02:22:42,559

878
02:22:42,559 --> 02:22:45,760

that's bad

883
02:22:58,129 --> 02:23:00,129
remember you always got to assume

884
02:23:00,129 --> 02:23:02,129
that the dealer has a ten under there so

885
02:23:02,129 --> 02:23:04,129
I mean I could stand here or I could fucking

886
02:23:04,129 --> 02:23:06,129
hit it and I think I'm gonna hit it

887
02:23:10,920 --> 02:23:15,719
thirteen

888
02:23:15,719 --> 02:23:18,530
yeah

889
02:23:18,530 --> 02:23:22,500
that's a bust

890
02:23:22,500 --> 02:23:24,500
that's what you gotta do man he's gonna turn over a ten and you just lose anyway

891
02:23:24,500 --> 02:23:27,959
thirteen

892
02:23:27,959 --> 02:23:29,959
sixteen

893
02:23:29,959 --> 02:23:31,959
twenty

894
02:23:31,959 --> 02:23:37,079
you gotta always assume

895
02:23:37,079 --> 02:23:39,079
that there's a ten under there

896
02:23:39,079 --> 02:23:42,149
the dealer is forced to play

897
02:23:42,149 --> 02:23:44,149
until seventeen that's correct

898
02:23:54,069 --> 02:23:57,270
fucking three

899
02:23:57,270 --> 02:24:02,000
oh that's a five

900
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,309
that's a fucking eight

901
02:24:04,309 --> 02:24:06,309

907
02:24:29,440 --> 02:24:31,440

908
02:24:31,440 --> 02:24:33,440

915
02:24:52,819 --> 02:24:54,819
the bad luck on the table

916
02:24:56,819 --> 02:24:58,819
the guy with the bad luck on the

917
02:24:58,819 --> 02:25:00,819
table

02:25:00,819 --> 02:25:03,190

I need to get this achievement

928
02:25:38,600 --> 02:25:40,600
there's a challenge to double down and win

929
02:25:40,600 --> 02:25:42,600
you need to be in the right position

930
02:25:42,600 --> 02:25:45,729

931
02:25:45,729 --> 02:25:48,100

a six is like

945
02:26:55,319 --> 02:26:57,319
the biggest chance for you to win

02:27:06,639 --> 02:27:10,040
a deal of showing six is like

950
02:27:10,040 --> 02:27:12,040
the easiest

951
02:27:12,040 --> 02:27:14,040

02:29:34,930 --> 02:29:39,920
you're supposed to stand there

999
02:29:39,920 --> 02:29:41,920
listen to the chat room

1000
02:29:47,239 --> 02:29:49,239

1003
02:29:57,670 --> 02:29:59,670
push me again sir

1004
02:30:08,100 --> 02:30:10,100
he's the only guy ready to be playing with one cent

1005
02:30:10,100 --> 02:30:12,100
come on man

1006
02:30:14,100 --> 02:30:17,239
you're like the grandmother that sits at the slot machine

1007
02:30:17,239 --> 02:30:19,239
and plays one line one credit

1008
02:30:19,239 --> 02:30:21,239
and they sit there all day and smoke

1009
02:30:21,239 --> 02:30:23,239
four packs of cigarettes

1010
02:30:27,600 --> 02:30:29,600
what's his card fifteen

1011
02:30:35,319 --> 02:30:37,319
busted

1012
02:30:37,319 --> 02:30:39,319
oh my fucking god how many cards

1013
02:30:39,319 --> 02:30:41,319
how many low cards are you gonna pull out of there

1014
02:30:54,879 --> 02:31:04,209
hmm

1015
02:31:04,209 --> 02:31:06,209
I'm about to pull the gun off

1016
02:31:08,209 --> 02:31:14,229
that's it

1017
02:31:14,229 --> 02:31:16,229
just double down every time

1018
02:31:16,229 --> 02:31:21,799
I'm gonna lose all my money

1019
02:31:25,319 --> 02:31:27,319
just give me something more

1020
02:31:27,319 --> 02:31:29,319
it's twenty but I don't

1021
02:31:29,319 --> 02:31:31,319
I want like an eleven

1022
02:31:31,319 --> 02:31:33,319
you know what I mean

1023
02:31:33,319 --> 02:31:35,319
something I can actually double down on

1024
02:31:35,319 --> 02:31:37,319
like give me a ten or nine

1025
02:31:37,319 --> 02:31:39,319
nine ten eleven

1026
02:31:39,319 --> 02:31:41,319
eleven

1027
02:31:41,319 --> 02:31:43,319
oh what the hell

1028
02:31:43,319 --> 02:31:50,739
at least I fucking won

1029
02:31:50,739 --> 02:31:52,739
I can't double down on every hand

1030
02:31:52,739 --> 02:31:54,739
because if it's a hand like

1031
02:31:54,739 --> 02:31:56,739
you'll just bust the hand

1032
02:31:56,739 --> 02:31:58,739
bets are open now

1033
02:31:58,739 --> 02:32:00,739
I told you guys I'm not addicted to this

1034
02:32:00,739 --> 02:32:02,739
I'm just doing this for the achievement because

1035
02:32:02,739 --> 02:32:04,739
there's a challenge

1036
02:32:04,739 --> 02:32:06,739
you want me to unlock the outfit

1037
02:32:06,739 --> 02:32:10,770
there's a gambler outfit I need to do the challenges

1038
02:32:10,770 --> 02:32:12,770
give me two

1039
02:32:12,770 --> 02:32:14,950
sixteen

1040
02:32:14,950 --> 02:32:16,950
this is like the worst thing

1041
02:32:16,950 --> 02:32:18,950
this is the worst position

1042
02:32:18,950 --> 02:32:20,950
to be in

1043
02:32:20,950 --> 02:32:22,950
fifteen versus seventeen

1044
02:32:22,950 --> 02:32:24,950
like what the fuck am I supposed to do here

1045
02:32:24,950 --> 02:32:26,950
I'm probably gonna have to stand it

1046
02:32:26,950 --> 02:32:28,950
I mean

1047
02:32:28,950 --> 02:32:30,950
you're supposed to hit but

1048
02:32:30,950 --> 02:32:40,850
got it

1049
02:32:40,850 --> 02:32:43,860
that guy just double down

1050
02:32:43,860 --> 02:32:45,860
can I just move up with one seat

1051
02:32:47,860 --> 02:32:49,860
don't you do it

1052
02:32:49,860 --> 02:32:52,610
nineteen

1053
02:32:52,610 --> 02:32:56,959
you're gonna double down and win five times

1054
02:32:56,959 --> 02:32:58,959
double down yeah

1055
02:32:58,959 --> 02:33:00,959
I mean I guess I could just play

1056
02:33:00,959 --> 02:33:02,959
okay I'm gonna play four cent bets

1057
02:33:02,959 --> 02:33:05,399
and double down every single

1058
02:33:05,399 --> 02:33:07,399
time until I win five times

1059
02:33:09,399 --> 02:33:11,399
I did four cents and here comes blackjack

1060
02:33:11,399 --> 02:33:20,420
double down

1061
02:33:23,239 --> 02:33:27,200
I mean I need to stand on it

1062
02:33:27,200 --> 02:33:29,200
why would I hit out of nineteen

1063
02:33:29,200 --> 02:33:31,200
fifteen

1064
02:33:35,829 --> 02:33:37,829
if you did that at like a

1065
02:33:37,829 --> 02:33:39,829
blackjack table the whole table would turn

1066
02:33:39,829 --> 02:33:41,829
and be like what the fuck did you just do

1067
02:33:52,129 --> 02:33:58,920
I just need to win

1068
02:33:58,920 --> 02:34:00,920
we just gotta get it out of our system and do it here

1069
02:34:03,350 --> 02:34:05,350
nine, two, give me a two

1070
02:34:05,350 --> 02:34:07,780
you had to give me a three

1071
02:34:07,780 --> 02:34:09,780
and yet it's a king

1072
02:34:09,780 --> 02:34:13,170
that's fantastic

1073
02:34:13,170 --> 02:34:15,170
a twelve versus a twenty

1074
02:34:15,170 --> 02:34:17,729
wonderful might as well double

1075
02:34:17,729 --> 02:34:19,729
fucking down

1076
02:34:19,729 --> 02:34:21,729
okay

1077
02:34:24,530 --> 02:34:26,530
it's time for the shotgun

1078
02:34:26,530 --> 02:34:31,270
joke

1079
02:34:31,270 --> 02:34:33,270

1080
02:34:33,270 --> 02:34:37,239
my fucking god

1081
02:34:37,239 --> 02:34:40,500
you just have to always assume

1082
02:34:40,500 --> 02:34:43,829
I've been here for four days

1083
02:34:43,829 --> 02:34:45,829
I'm not going to shotgun

1084
02:34:45,829 --> 02:34:47,829

1085
02:34:47,829 --> 02:34:50,840

1086
02:34:50,840 --> 02:34:53,909
shotgun, no

1087
02:34:55,909 --> 02:34:57,909
refuse to double down on two cent bets

1088
02:34:57,909 --> 02:35:00,600
yeah, fifteen

1089
02:35:00,600 --> 02:35:02,600
might as well, versus an eight

1090
02:35:02,600 --> 02:35:04,600
might as well double down and lose

1091
02:35:10,399 --> 02:35:12,399
oh that's a bust Kermit

1092
02:35:12,399 --> 02:35:14,399

1098
02:35:37,079 --> 02:35:39,079

1099
02:35:42,600 --> 02:35:44,600

1100
02:35:44,600 --> 02:35:46,770

1102
02:35:48,770 --> 02:35:52,159
or

1103
02:35:52,159 --> 02:35:54,159
I could just double down

1104
02:35:54,159 --> 02:35:56,159
oh they don't let you do it

1105
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:04,159
you can do that

1106
02:36:04,159 --> 02:36:06,159
you don't have to take the blackjack

1107
02:36:06,159 --> 02:36:08,159
what the hell

1108
02:36:08,159 --> 02:36:10,659

1109
02:36:10,659 --> 02:36:13,729
okay

1110
02:36:13,729 --> 02:36:15,729

1114
02:36:31,489 --> 02:36:33,920

02:36:33,920 --> 02:36:35,920

1118
02:36:41,299 --> 02:36:43,299
nineteen

1119
02:36:43,299 --> 02:36:53,860
no

1120
02:36:53,860 --> 02:36:56,870
you actually can't double down

1121
02:36:56,870 --> 02:36:59,239
on a blackjack

1122
02:36:59,239 --> 02:37:01,239
this is where you are

1123
02:37:01,239 --> 02:37:03,239
there are plenty of casinos around here that you don't have to take the blackjack

1124
02:37:03,239 --> 02:37:05,239
you can just play it

1125
02:37:09,719 --> 02:37:11,719
double down here it comes

1126
02:37:13,719 --> 02:37:15,719

1127
02:37:15,719 --> 02:37:18,469

ten

1129
02:37:20,469 --> 02:37:24,370
this other guy's been here longer than I have

1130
02:37:24,370 --> 02:37:27,190
yeah that's true

1131
02:37:27,190 --> 02:37:29,190

1132
02:37:29,190 --> 02:37:32,450

02:37:41,409 --> 02:37:44,799

02:37:50,629 --> 02:37:52,870
I haven't been in this position

1136
02:37:52,870 --> 02:37:54,870
eighty percent of the time

1137
02:37:57,600 --> 02:37:59,600
sixteen

1138
02:37:59,600 --> 02:38:01,600

1139
02:38:08,149 --> 02:38:10,149

1141
02:38:17,510 --> 02:38:19,510
I just need to do that three more times

1142
02:38:19,510 --> 02:38:27,059
where's my progress update

1143
02:38:27,059 --> 02:38:29,299
did that not count

1144
02:38:29,299 --> 02:38:35,440
why did the counter not show up

1145
02:38:51,329 --> 02:38:54,920
it shows the first progress you did get it okay

1146
02:38:56,920 --> 02:38:58,920
I'm playing blackjack so awfully right now

1147
02:38:58,920 --> 02:39:00,920
but it's just to double down

1148
02:39:00,920 --> 02:39:02,920
every hand

1149
02:39:02,920 --> 02:39:04,920
I would have won if I didn't fucking do that

1150
02:39:04,920 --> 02:39:11,000
see you in sixty minutes when we get

1151
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
three other double downs

1152
02:39:15,489 --> 02:39:18,629
how much money do I have

1153
02:39:18,629 --> 02:39:22,850
I'm just running out of money I have to be careful

1154
02:39:25,479 --> 02:39:28,610
there's an ace

1155
02:39:30,610 --> 02:39:34,000
no blackjack alright

1156
02:39:36,500 --> 02:39:38,500

1159
02:39:45,569 --> 02:39:47,569
I think I'm gonna double

1160
02:39:47,569 --> 02:39:49,569
fifteen

1161
02:39:49,569 --> 02:39:51,569
that was a good play

1162
02:39:51,569 --> 02:39:54,709
sixteen

1163
02:39:54,709 --> 02:39:56,709
that's almost impossible to do that

1164
02:39:56,709 --> 02:40:00,479
consecutively

1165
02:40:00,479 --> 02:40:02,479

1166
02:40:02,479 --> 02:40:04,479

I would have got it

1209
02:42:23,170 --> 02:42:25,170
if I double down right there I would have got that ace

1210
02:42:25,170 --> 02:42:29,649
fifteen

1211
02:42:29,649 --> 02:42:31,959

the dealer is making money

1233
02:43:37,719 --> 02:43:43,159
I hear people that are just question marking

1234
02:43:43,159 --> 02:43:45,159
anyone that just comes in right now

1235
02:43:45,159 --> 02:43:47,329
will just think I'm an idiot

1236
02:43:47,329 --> 02:43:49,329
that I just don't understand this game

1237
02:43:49,329 --> 02:43:51,760
I just double down every hand

1238
02:43:51,760 --> 02:43:53,760

1239
02:43:53,760 --> 02:43:55,760

1240
02:43:55,760 --> 02:43:59,350

1249
02:44:20,280 --> 02:44:22,639

1250
02:44:22,639 --> 02:44:24,639

1251
02:44:24,639 --> 02:44:28,870
I'm running out of sense to double

1252
02:44:28,870 --> 02:44:30,870
down on here

1253
02:44:30,870 --> 02:44:36,819

fourteen

1256

sixteen

1257
02:44:47,799 --> 02:44:49,799
don't flip over a ten

1258
02:44:49,799 --> 02:44:52,100
yeah

1259
02:44:52,100 --> 02:44:54,100
blackjack requires zero skill

1260
02:44:54,100 --> 02:44:56,100
I have a little bit

1261
02:44:56,100 --> 02:44:58,100
of news for you here

1262
02:44:58,100 --> 02:45:00,100
none of them do

1263
02:45:00,100 --> 02:45:02,100
the only one that requires any actual

1264
02:45:02,100 --> 02:45:04,100
real skill is poker

1265
02:45:04,100 --> 02:45:07,239
thank you very much

1266
02:45:07,239 --> 02:45:10,500
none of these do

1267
02:45:10,500 --> 02:45:14,149
I'll do two cents

1268
02:45:14,149 --> 02:45:16,149
newsflash

1269
02:45:16,149 --> 02:45:20,879
no I can't double down on this

1270
02:45:41,799 --> 02:45:44,100
lightning can't strike twice guys

1271
02:45:44,100 --> 02:45:49,090
eighteen

1272
02:45:49,090 --> 02:45:51,090
some of the card games require thought

1273
02:45:51,090 --> 02:45:53,329
but skill

1274
02:45:53,329 --> 02:45:55,569
skill

1275
02:45:55,569 --> 02:45:57,569
oh I don't have enough money to double down

1276
02:45:57,569 --> 02:45:59,569
here I'm getting up

1277
02:45:59,569 --> 02:46:01,569
thank you

1278
02:46:01,569 --> 02:46:03,569
they require thought but at the end

1279
02:46:03,569 --> 02:46:05,569
of the day it's random cards

1280
02:46:05,569 --> 02:46:07,569
being thrown down

1281
02:46:07,569 --> 02:46:14,420
I need to get it

1282
02:46:14,420 --> 02:46:21,590
one more time

1283
02:46:21,590 --> 02:46:23,590
I have to get it double down one more time

1284
02:46:23,590 --> 02:46:27,299
so then we can be done with this

1285
02:46:27,299 --> 02:46:29,299
he sits down at the slot machine and is like

1286
02:46:29,299 --> 02:46:31,299
wow I'm really good at this

1287
02:46:31,299 --> 02:46:37,639
you mean to tell me that there's

1288
02:46:37,639 --> 02:46:39,639
a computer algorithm

1289
02:46:39,639 --> 02:46:41,639
that makes me lose

1290
02:46:41,639 --> 02:46:43,639
eighty five percent of the time

1291
02:46:43,639 --> 02:46:46,389
but no this is the special

1292
02:46:46,389 --> 02:46:48,389
machine I sit at this one

1293
02:46:48,389 --> 02:46:50,389
I take up the whole row

1294
02:46:50,389 --> 02:46:52,389
of this one

1295
02:46:52,389 --> 02:46:54,690
buffalo machine

1296
02:46:54,690 --> 02:46:56,690
and I put in five cents on each one

1297
02:46:56,690 --> 02:46:58,690
and I go click click click click click click

1298
02:46:58,690 --> 02:47:04,180
across the whole row

1299
02:47:04,180 --> 02:47:06,739
how much did I just bet?

1300
02:47:06,739 --> 02:47:14,079
no

1301
02:47:14,079 --> 02:47:16,079
you dummy

1302
02:47:16,079 --> 02:47:18,579
I just do one cent

1303
02:47:18,579 --> 02:47:23,510
bets

1304
02:47:33,110 --> 02:47:38,229
okay we got eights

1305
02:47:38,229 --> 02:47:41,809
we're splitting it

1306
02:47:41,809 --> 02:47:43,809
no blackjack right? we're splitting these eights

1307
02:47:43,809 --> 02:47:45,809
split them

1308
02:47:45,809 --> 02:47:50,799
oh baby

1309
02:47:50,799 --> 02:47:54,049
ten

1310
02:47:54,049 --> 02:47:57,620
do it again

1311
02:47:57,620 --> 02:47:59,860
again

1312
02:48:01,860 --> 02:48:06,209
ten

1313
02:48:06,209 --> 02:48:08,879
card please

1314
02:48:08,879 --> 02:48:10,879
twenty

1315
02:48:10,879 --> 02:48:14,719
eighteen

1316
02:48:14,719 --> 02:48:16,719
by the way splitting eights

1317
02:48:16,719 --> 02:48:18,719
versus a face card on the table

1318
02:48:18,719 --> 02:48:20,719
do not ever do this

1319
02:48:20,719 --> 02:48:23,280
for any reason

1320
02:48:23,280 --> 02:48:25,280
don't ever do that

1321
02:48:25,280 --> 02:48:28,479
I did it for the effect of the comedy

1322
02:48:28,479 --> 02:48:30,479
there you go that's why you don't do that

1323
02:48:30,479 --> 02:48:32,479
that's the reason why you never do that

1324
02:48:32,479 --> 02:48:37,920
always split eights

1325
02:48:37,920 --> 02:48:39,920
as in eights I disagree

1326
02:48:39,920 --> 02:48:41,920
because if the guy's showing a face card

1327
02:48:41,920 --> 02:48:43,920
you're going to lose twice as much money

1328
02:48:43,920 --> 02:48:45,920
like right there he flipped it over

1329
02:48:45,920 --> 02:48:47,920
I would say in the German on eight five

1330
02:48:47,920 --> 02:48:50,870
gambler's handbook

1331
02:48:50,870 --> 02:48:52,870
I know the always split eights

1332
02:48:52,870 --> 02:48:54,870
no matter what

1333
02:48:54,870 --> 02:48:56,870
I don't fucking buy it

1334
02:48:56,870 --> 02:49:05,809
alright double down let's win

1335
02:49:05,809 --> 02:49:07,809

02:52:18,340 --> 02:52:20,340
English bloke

1375
02:52:20,340 --> 02:52:22,340
lovely fella

1376
02:52:22,340 --> 02:52:24,340
he went missing and now I'm all

1377
02:52:24,340 --> 02:52:27,479
alone

1378
02:52:27,479 --> 02:52:32,209
that's it

1379
02:52:32,209 --> 02:52:34,520
that's too bad

1380
02:52:34,520 --> 02:52:47,700
did I kill his friend?

1381
02:52:47,700 --> 02:52:55,879
that's really

1382
02:52:55,879 --> 02:52:58,500
Gavin

1383
02:52:58,500 --> 02:53:02,399
Gavin

1384
02:53:02,399 --> 02:53:04,709
Gavin

1385
02:53:04,709 --> 02:53:15,700
I hope you find Kevin

1386
02:53:15,700 --> 02:53:17,700
when was the last time you saw

1387
02:53:17,700 --> 02:53:21,030
Kevin

1388
02:53:21,030 --> 02:53:23,200
if we see a guy

1389
02:53:23,200 --> 02:53:25,200
named Kevin anymore make sure

1390
02:53:25,200 --> 02:53:27,959
make sure you say something

1391
02:53:27,959 --> 02:53:37,170
I think that's all I can do with this guy

1392
02:53:37,170 --> 02:53:40,819
press zero to help him

1393
02:53:40,819 --> 02:53:42,819
press circle to help him

1394
02:53:42,819 --> 02:53:49,600
Jeremy he's saying Gavin

1395
02:53:49,600 --> 02:54:01,639
ride the donkey

1396
02:54:01,639 --> 02:54:09,000
it's giving me an option to do something here

1397
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:21,479
what is it

1398
02:54:21,479 --> 02:54:23,479
what are you doing

1399
02:54:23,479 --> 02:54:29,430
Gavin

1400
02:54:29,430 --> 02:54:37,110
free the donkey

1401
02:54:37,110 --> 02:54:39,729
how am I supposed to do that

1402
02:54:39,729 --> 02:54:41,729
I can't free him I can't pull a gun out

1403
02:54:41,729 --> 02:54:43,729
I can't do anything here

1404
02:54:43,729 --> 02:54:45,729
we're going to go to Gavin

1405
02:54:45,729 --> 02:54:53,600
why am I not eating anything

1406
02:54:53,600 --> 02:55:08,520
more food please

1407
02:55:08,520 --> 02:55:22,069
okay I'm going to mount my horse

1408
02:55:22,069 --> 02:55:24,069
this is much further than I thought it was

1409
02:56:00,579 --> 02:56:02,579
I couldn't see

1410
02:56:02,579 --> 02:56:05,780
him no witnesses nobody can see

1411
02:56:05,780 --> 02:56:11,159
easy don't run over anybody

1412
02:56:11,159 --> 02:56:21,200
else

1413
02:56:47,729 --> 02:56:49,729
I'm a student

1414
02:56:49,729 --> 02:56:51,729
of the history of the region

1415
02:56:51,729 --> 02:56:53,729
I ain't the one to speak to

1416
02:56:53,729 --> 02:56:55,729
think he's down there by

1417
02:56:55,729 --> 02:56:57,729
the wood store

1418
02:56:57,729 --> 02:56:59,729
okay

1419
02:56:59,729 --> 02:57:09,270
let's get back on the horse

1420
02:57:09,270 --> 02:57:11,270
I just kind of ruined their stuff that's fine

1421
02:57:11,270 --> 02:57:14,280
are you the

1422
02:57:14,280 --> 02:57:16,280
boy that I'm looking for

1423
02:57:16,280 --> 02:57:21,959
BG definitely

1424
02:57:21,959 --> 02:57:23,959
because I'm slowing down

1425
02:57:23,959 --> 02:57:27,409
I'll see you at the sheriff's office

1426
02:57:27,409 --> 02:57:31,440
excuse me

1427
02:57:31,440 --> 02:57:33,440
friend

1428
02:57:33,440 --> 02:57:35,440
not yet but he is hoping

1429
02:57:35,440 --> 02:57:37,680
I guess

1430
02:57:37,680 --> 02:57:39,680
you don't get a lot of traveling men here

1431
02:57:39,680 --> 02:57:41,680
and suddenly there's a whole phalanx

1432
02:57:41,680 --> 02:57:43,680
of mysterious but strangely

1433
02:57:43,680 --> 02:57:45,680
helpful yankees

1434
02:57:45,680 --> 02:57:47,680
what are you doing here

1435
02:57:47,680 --> 02:57:49,680
I'm just looking for work

1436
02:57:49,680 --> 02:57:51,680
looking for something

1437
02:57:51,680 --> 02:57:53,680
don't worry your secret's safe with me

1438
02:57:53,680 --> 02:57:55,680
I got a secret of my own

1439
02:57:55,680 --> 02:57:57,680
are you secretly normal

1440
02:57:57,680 --> 02:58:00,049
never mind

1441
02:58:00,049 --> 02:58:02,049
like an improv routine

1442
02:58:02,049 --> 02:58:04,049
I don't know why

1443
02:58:04,049 --> 02:58:06,049
I love her you know

1444
02:58:06,049 --> 02:58:08,049
Penelope

1445
02:58:08,049 --> 02:58:10,049
but it's impossible

1446
02:58:10,049 --> 02:58:12,049
love tends to be complicated

1447
02:58:12,049 --> 02:58:14,049
she's a Braithwaite

1448
02:58:14,049 --> 02:58:16,049
I'm Beau Grey son of Tavish Grey

1449
02:58:16,049 --> 02:58:18,049
nephew of Lee Grey

1450
02:58:18,049 --> 02:58:20,049
the sheriff grandson of old Murdo Grey

1451
02:58:20,049 --> 02:58:22,049
we Grays have been loyal

1452
02:58:22,049 --> 02:58:24,049
to the state and murderers to the Braithwaite

1453
02:58:24,049 --> 02:58:26,049
for so long now no one can even

1454
02:58:26,049 --> 02:58:28,049
quite explain why

1455
02:58:28,049 --> 02:58:30,049
but just because he's got the fucking hair

1456
02:58:30,049 --> 02:58:32,049
all of a sudden he becomes me

1457
02:58:32,049 --> 02:58:34,049
all to some nonsense while she

1458
02:58:34,049 --> 02:58:36,049
she's amazing

1459
02:58:36,049 --> 02:58:38,049
she's like a woman

1460
02:58:38,049 --> 02:58:40,049
from the future she's like

1461
02:58:40,049 --> 02:58:42,049
tomorrow if tomorrow turns out

1462
02:58:42,049 --> 02:58:44,049
fine well I'm sorry

1463
02:58:44,049 --> 02:58:46,049
for your predicament would you help

1464
02:58:46,049 --> 02:58:48,049
I don't want to get involved

1465
02:58:48,049 --> 02:58:50,049
gang fusion seems

1466
02:58:50,049 --> 02:58:52,049
unseemly I'll pay

1467
02:58:52,049 --> 02:58:54,049
I've got money we Grays

1468
02:58:54,049 --> 02:58:56,049
we've always got money no brains mind but

1469
02:58:56,049 --> 02:58:58,049
money I know

1470
02:58:58,049 --> 02:59:00,049
she loves to sit out in the gazebo

1471
02:59:00,049 --> 02:59:02,049
on the edge of the Braithwaite property

1472
02:59:02,049 --> 02:59:04,049
take her this letter

1473
02:59:04,049 --> 02:59:06,049
and this bracelet

1474
02:59:06,049 --> 02:59:11,299
please

1475
02:59:11,299 --> 02:59:13,299
and you'll never hear from me ever again

1476
02:59:13,299 --> 02:59:20,079
sneak into the grounds

1477
02:59:20,079 --> 02:59:22,079
around Braithwaite

1478
02:59:22,079 --> 02:59:28,549
manor where's my

1479
02:59:28,549 --> 02:59:30,549
little friend

1480
02:59:30,549 --> 02:59:44,040
come on then

1481
02:59:44,040 --> 02:59:46,040
what the fuck happened what the

1482
02:59:46,040 --> 02:59:48,040
fuck what

1483
02:59:48,040 --> 02:59:50,209
wow that scared the shit out

1484
02:59:50,209 --> 02:59:52,209
of me what

1485
02:59:52,209 --> 03:00:00,639
what hey

1486
03:00:00,639 --> 03:00:02,639
I'm getting shot out of a cannon

1487
03:00:02,639 --> 03:00:14,799
we won't run over anybody

1488
03:00:14,799 --> 03:00:22,979
shut up

1489
03:00:22,979 --> 03:00:25,409
two guards who do you think you are

1490
03:00:25,409 --> 03:00:37,889
that was a little delayed reaction

1491
03:00:37,889 --> 03:00:41,860
on my part

1492
03:00:41,860 --> 03:00:49,280
that's pretty good music

1493
03:00:49,280 --> 03:01:01,569
I still have no shoes on

1494
03:01:01,569 --> 03:01:08,209
sorry

1495
03:01:08,209 --> 03:01:10,209
so sneak into this manor

1496
03:01:10,209 --> 03:01:15,459
workers watch out for workers

1497
03:01:15,459 --> 03:01:19,360
they're like landmines

1498
03:01:19,360 --> 03:01:37,729
you guys don't want to step on them

1499
03:01:37,729 --> 03:01:52,899
what sneak past the guards

1500
03:01:52,899 --> 03:01:54,899
so there are

1501
03:01:54,899 --> 03:01:56,899
there's a guy that way

1502
03:01:56,899 --> 03:02:00,360
I can't see the manor

1503
03:02:00,360 --> 03:02:02,719
it's so foggy

1504
03:02:02,719 --> 03:02:07,010
there's the manor

1505
03:02:07,010 --> 03:02:09,250
I think there's one guard out front

1506
03:02:09,250 --> 03:02:12,260
but there might be another one

1507
03:02:12,260 --> 03:02:14,260
is that it? I think it's just this one guy

1508
03:02:14,260 --> 03:02:21,040
he's right there

1509
03:02:21,040 --> 03:02:23,040
ahh he's turning

1510
03:02:23,040 --> 03:02:39,170
how close do they have to be

1511
03:02:39,170 --> 03:02:41,540
I guess maybe not that

1512
03:02:41,540 --> 03:03:02,920
I guess I'm fine

1513
03:03:02,920 --> 03:03:08,040
I'm just going to keep it expanded the whole time

1514
03:03:08,040 --> 03:03:14,049
why don't you do the double foot

1515
03:03:14,049 --> 03:03:19,940
stomp there

1516
03:03:19,940 --> 03:03:21,940
how much further away are you

1517
03:03:21,940 --> 03:03:33,590
where is Penelope

1518
03:03:33,590 --> 03:03:38,389
you just sit at the lake

1519
03:03:38,389 --> 03:03:45,479
apparently

1520
03:03:45,479 --> 03:03:47,479
I don't think there's anybody else

1521
03:03:47,479 --> 03:04:23,430
wet socks

1522
03:04:23,430 --> 03:04:29,889
I don't have any socks on

1523
03:04:29,889 --> 03:04:31,889
I made it so does she know I'm coming

1524
03:04:31,889 --> 03:04:56,069
I made it

1525
03:05:02,440 --> 03:05:05,829
a gift

1526
03:05:05,829 --> 03:05:08,260
what a gift well we don't even know each other

1527
03:05:08,260 --> 03:05:10,260
well it's not from me it's from

1528
03:05:10,260 --> 03:05:12,260
from Bo

1529
03:05:12,260 --> 03:05:14,260
oh he's

1530
03:05:14,260 --> 03:05:16,260
so strange

1531
03:05:16,260 --> 03:05:18,260
yes he's a little strange

1532
03:05:18,260 --> 03:05:20,260
but also so

1533
03:05:20,260 --> 03:05:22,260
human the rest of our families

1534
03:05:22,260 --> 03:05:24,260
are stuck in the dark ages

1535
03:05:24,260 --> 03:05:26,260
well I don't know

1536
03:05:26,260 --> 03:05:28,260
cave people perhaps

1537
03:05:28,260 --> 03:05:30,260
Bo's different

1538
03:05:30,260 --> 03:05:32,260
but if they find out

1539
03:05:32,260 --> 03:05:34,260
they'll kill him and send me to live

1540
03:05:34,260 --> 03:05:36,260
someplace awesome handsome

1541
03:05:36,260 --> 03:05:38,260
smart funny

1542
03:05:38,260 --> 03:05:40,260
have you ever been to Ohio sir

1543
03:05:40,260 --> 03:05:42,260
no well neither have I

1544
03:05:42,260 --> 03:05:44,260
but my uncle has a factory there

1545
03:05:44,260 --> 03:05:46,260
he was sort of the black sheep

1546
03:05:46,260 --> 03:05:48,260
on account of having left

1547
03:05:48,260 --> 03:05:50,260
but now they tolerate him

1548
03:05:50,260 --> 03:05:52,260
because he's a vicious snob

1549
03:05:52,260 --> 03:05:54,629
families

1550
03:05:54,629 --> 03:05:56,629
are are

1551
03:05:56,629 --> 03:05:58,629
there's something else

1552
03:05:58,629 --> 03:06:00,629
you got a family sir

1553
03:06:00,629 --> 03:06:02,629
well they tolerate him

1554
03:06:02,629 --> 03:06:04,629
because of the money but me

1555
03:06:04,629 --> 03:06:06,629
with my ideas above my station

1556
03:06:06,629 --> 03:06:08,629
they can't stand

1557
03:06:08,629 --> 03:06:10,629
that sounds pretty complicated

1558
03:06:10,629 --> 03:06:12,629
I don't know

1559
03:06:12,629 --> 03:06:14,629
quite what to say nothing to say

1560
03:06:14,629 --> 03:06:16,629
except I hope they all rot

1561
03:06:16,629 --> 03:06:18,870

1565
03:06:25,170 --> 03:06:27,409

03:16:47,219 --> 03:16:52,850

Legendary turkey. Let's see where he is. Where is the legendary turkey?

1791
03:27:32,209 --> 03:27:37,329
There is no legendary turkey

1792
03:27:37,690 --> 03:27:55,760
As much as we all wish there was who farted away. What do you mean who farted?

1854
03:37:54,389 --> 03:38:04,100
It's a magic car. Is that it?

1855
03:38:05,510 --> 03:38:07,110
There's one more thing in there

1856
03:38:07,110 --> 03:38:17,139
There's like a pack of gum in there

1857
03:38:17,139 --> 03:38:22,329

Well, I did it before

1861
03:39:47,479 --> 03:39:49,559
I did it that one time. Was that just a fluke?

1862
03:39:50,760 --> 03:39:52,760
Did I actually do something cool?

1863
03:39:54,229 --> 03:39:56,229
What if I was the legendary turkey?

1864
03:40:04,819 --> 03:40:06,579
I don't think so

1865
03:40:06,579 --> 03:40:10,549
All right. I'm in this area

1866
03:40:12,979 --> 03:40:20,889

03:42:57,350 --> 03:42:59,590
Too bad. I can't go in here. There's no way to get in this building

1876
03:43:04,010 --> 03:43:09,129
Oh, I thought that was a belt

1877
03:43:09,129 --> 03:43:11,450
You've got a lot of dynamite. Can I pick any of this up?

1878
03:43:12,170 --> 03:43:17,399
There's nothing I can do with the dynamite. Can I drive a dynamite truck?

Oh, man. Yeah, you can't I can't take any of this

That's unfortunate

1882
03:44:00,760 --> 03:44:03,159
Shoot it. I don't shoot it. Well, this thing is in bad condition

1883
03:44:04,459 --> 03:44:05,659

I have to use two gun oils on this

1885
03:44:09,780 --> 03:44:19,319

03:48:21,420 --> 03:48:23,719
american alligator

1922
03:48:23,719 --> 03:48:25,879
Yields of skin teeth and big game meat

1923
03:48:27,110 --> 03:48:30,469
Use a bow with improved arrows a long scope rifle for a clean kill

1924
03:48:37,370 --> 03:49:04,840
Come here horse

1925
03:49:04,840 --> 03:49:18,040
In the head what's the correct place to shoot an alligator?

1926
03:49:18,520 --> 03:49:26,819
I turned him into a rug

1927
03:49:26,819 --> 03:49:42,250
Okay, I was gonna go fishing here

1928
03:49:49,190 --> 03:49:50,489
I got him

1929
03:49:50,489 --> 03:49:52,459
He's just a little one

1930
03:49:52,459 --> 03:49:54,139
He was really small

1931
03:49:54,139 --> 03:49:58,739
And he looked a lot bigger in the scalp

1932
03:49:59,540 --> 03:50:14,979
This is bad

1933
03:50:14,979 --> 03:50:16,979
That's poor alligator skin

1934
03:50:17,139 --> 03:50:24,010
All right, let's go fishing

1935
03:50:24,010 --> 03:50:27,420
There's a fish right here

1936
03:50:27,420 --> 03:50:29,379
Okay bait

03:50:29,379 --> 03:50:34,389
Uh track small fish which is a red bait

1938
03:50:35,110 --> 03:50:38,229
Lake lure tracks all medium and large sized lake fish

Give me something good throw dynamite in the water. No, it's gonna be high quality

03:51:22,899 --> 03:51:24,899

1943
03:51:26,090 --> 03:51:29,540
Easy

1944
03:51:29,540 --> 03:51:43,559
I got an alligator just fish with your hands

1945
03:51:44,360 --> 03:51:46,360
I don't think it works like that

1946
03:51:46,360 --> 03:51:49,639
Good to meet you

1947
03:51:49,639 --> 03:51:53,420

One ounce large mouth bass

1950
03:52:01,620 --> 03:52:12,010
Try a different spot over here right in that spot. I see little bubbles

Come on. Come on. I can't cast and water that deep

1952
03:52:48,469 --> 03:52:54,250

1963
03:55:43,020 --> 03:55:45,819
Wait, where did this alligator come? Huh?

1964
03:55:46,540 --> 03:56:00,040
The dynamite killed an alligator at the bottom and turned it into bundled up skin

1965
03:56:05,379 --> 03:56:15,750
All right. Okay. Let's go. I'm like standing in muck

But you get the bit the snout

2059
04:08:20,790 --> 04:08:24,010
You just burn the snout and just

You'll crunch right through it. It'll be like chewing on cigarette ashes, but it'll be enough

Imagine the mosquitoes. Well, I don't even want to imagine what what wait, wait, wait, where am I?

I mean to be fair. I did try to stomp on an alligator's head with bare feet

2085
04:15:15,829 --> 04:15:21,819
I need to see what it was gonna happen. I need to see what was gonna happen

Where'd it go? Wait, those are the good guys?

2097
04:17:20,010 --> 04:17:22,010
I thought that those are the bad guys

2098
04:17:45,829 --> 04:17:47,590
Someone just wrote

2099
04:17:47,590 --> 04:17:50,219
The soup

2100
04:17:50,219 --> 04:17:52,219
That was more important

2101
04:17:52,219 --> 04:17:53,100
This

2102
04:17:53,100 --> 04:17:56,170
This is more important

2103
04:17:56,170 --> 04:17:57,209
There

2104
04:17:57,209 --> 04:17:58,579
There you go

2105
04:17:58,579 --> 04:18:01,159
There's the soup

2106
04:18:01,159 --> 04:18:06,899
There it's in there. I know it looks like coffee grounds and fucking cigarette ashes, but I promise

2107
04:18:09,930 --> 04:18:17,610
Uh

2108
04:18:20,569 --> 04:18:22,569

2115
04:19:05,510 --> 04:19:09,700

04:22:05,350 --> 04:22:13,540
Clearing out of here for some maintenance work

2132
04:22:14,500 --> 04:22:15,940
Gladly

2133
04:22:15,940 --> 04:22:18,180
It's about time this place got cleaned up

2134
04:22:19,700 --> 04:22:21,700
This is not good for my health man

2135
04:22:25,620 --> 04:22:27,620
Playing a rock star game

2136
04:22:28,100 --> 04:22:31,780
Now go watch the gate. It's honestly it's the equivalent of smoking a pack of cigarettes every time you play

2137
04:22:35,459 --> 04:22:37,459
No, I gotta stop people from coming in here

2138
04:22:43,909 --> 04:22:48,549
Laughter is good for you. I know but like I I like feel drained after every one of these scenes

2139
04:22:49,190 --> 04:23:02,940
Mr. This lady's trying to come in here. Oh, that's the lady that was just here. Excuse me

2140
04:23:04,840 --> 04:23:12,950
I'm sorry, ma'am. The church grounds are closed for maintenance work. It's about time too

2141
04:23:13,670 --> 04:23:15,670
The place was in need of some care and attention

2142
04:23:19,399 --> 04:23:31,399
They come from more than one angle or just right the front right at the front door

2143
04:23:33,100 --> 04:23:36,549
Seeing the way you can really get in

2144
04:23:36,549 --> 04:23:38,979
Lick them

2145
04:23:43,399 --> 04:23:46,040

Get out of here. I thought I'm not supposed to hurt anybody

2149
04:24:26,340 --> 04:24:31,180

2150
04:24:56,329 --> 04:25:01,770

2153
04:25:13,379 --> 04:25:15,379
Well, this will do

2154
04:25:15,700 --> 04:25:18,659
Now get out of here before someone sees

2155
04:25:20,069 --> 04:25:22,069
Holy shit, I believe it's come to this

2156
04:25:23,540 --> 04:25:26,440
All right. Well, uh, how do we like put this back out of here?

2157
04:25:27,159 --> 04:25:28,840
Can we put this back?

2158
04:25:28,840 --> 04:25:31,399
That's more than than clear what I what I owe you

2159
04:25:39,209 --> 04:25:42,739
guys

2160
04:25:42,739 --> 04:25:44,629
guys, I

2161
04:25:44,629 --> 04:25:46,629
I can't throw dynamite in the hole

2162
04:25:48,340 --> 04:25:49,780
You understand

2163
04:25:49,780 --> 04:25:52,819
It's not even possible. So let's just leave leave it be

2164
04:25:53,780 --> 04:26:14,620
Get recovered. I wonder what a diamond brooch is worth

2165
04:26:16,739 --> 04:26:21,670
I can't do it

2166
04:26:21,670 --> 04:26:22,629
See

2167
04:26:22,629 --> 04:26:40,280
You can't use weapons

2168
04:26:44,700 --> 04:26:46,819
Bypass it

2169
04:26:46,819 --> 04:27:01,559
How I can't do a hail mary toss. I'm still in town

2170
04:27:06,840 --> 04:27:09,000
Yeah, I want to I kind of want to I need to go back to my camp here

2171
04:27:10,280 --> 04:27:13,219
You know what I mean?

2172
04:27:13,219 --> 04:27:15,700
Oh, I can't look at there's a random stranger here

2173
04:27:19,290 --> 04:27:21,020
the fence

2174
04:27:21,020 --> 04:27:23,020
Well, he's right here. Do I have anything to sell?

2175
04:27:23,819 --> 04:27:27,579
I need to bring that diamond thing back to the camp so I can't really sell it

2176
04:27:28,200 --> 04:27:30,200
reliably

2177
04:27:39,780 --> 04:27:43,799
Hello

2178
04:27:43,799 --> 04:27:49,129
I didn't even touch him. I didn't even touch him. I walked right

2179
04:27:53,299 --> 04:27:55,299
Having fun, mister

2180
04:27:55,379 --> 04:28:10,360
Good job bro. This guy

2181
04:28:15,100 --> 04:28:26,020
Well, I got it. There he is. Welcome. You just discovered my little shop here

2182
04:28:26,979 --> 04:28:30,440
What we got a large bag of jewelry

2183
04:28:38,979 --> 04:28:50,379
Three bucks each. That's it wedding ring. Give yourself cash

2184
04:28:55,129 --> 04:28:57,129
earrings

2185
04:28:59,129 --> 04:29:01,450
Give him back. Give him back. How do I give him back? Give him back

2186
04:29:02,250 --> 04:29:07,290
Give him back

2187
04:29:07,290 --> 04:29:13,340
Fuck I can use these somewhere. God damn it

2188
04:29:13,979 --> 04:29:20,700
Is there a buyback?

2189
04:29:20,700 --> 04:29:23,739
Shit. No, that's not

2190
04:29:24,459 --> 04:29:28,250
I can use those. I just

2191
04:29:28,250 --> 04:29:30,280
Didn't mean to do that

2192
04:29:34,379 --> 04:29:37,020
Hello, sir. Glad to have a new patron come through

2193
04:29:37,659 --> 04:29:43,700
You only need one anyways. Okay, that's fine

2194
04:29:44,340 --> 04:30:15,299
too far

2195
04:30:15,459 --> 04:30:36,059
Maybe not. Hold on

2196
04:30:36,059 --> 04:30:38,059
What are you doing?

2197
04:30:38,139 --> 04:30:43,700
I'm trying to double heel stomp the guy lying on the ground

2198
04:30:48,649 --> 04:30:52,809
I guess I could do this stranger, but no, I need to do this back to camp

2199
04:30:54,889 --> 04:30:58,170
Back to camp. I'm gonna give the provisions back

2200
04:30:59,379 --> 04:31:04,940
And never mind spoke too soon

2201
04:31:09,690 --> 04:31:11,290
Easy

2202
04:31:11,290 --> 04:31:31,299
I can't jump on the train

2203
04:32:04,280 --> 04:32:13,079
All right, I can take this

2204
04:32:19,940 --> 04:32:21,940
I can sell this to events

2205
04:32:23,219 --> 04:32:30,680
But wait about the train don't get stuck in the box again. I know seriously

2206
04:32:31,959 --> 04:32:33,959
I'll do everything possible to not have that happen

2207
04:32:34,360 --> 04:32:37,659
So that's still there

2208
04:32:37,659 --> 04:32:43,020
What am I doing?

2209
04:32:43,020 --> 04:32:48,409
I can drive the train

2210
04:32:48,409 --> 04:32:50,409
You can drive the train

2211
04:32:50,649 --> 04:33:08,619
Let my horse stay get out of here

2212
04:33:09,340 --> 04:33:24,250
This guy's waiting for the train

2213
04:33:24,569 --> 04:33:42,099
Can I pick up passengers?

2214
04:33:42,259 --> 04:33:56,540
It's steaming this guy

2215
04:34:19,900 --> 04:34:21,340
Okay

2216
04:34:21,340 --> 04:34:24,279
Okay. Bye. That was fun

2217
04:34:24,439 --> 04:34:39,220
What's the purpose of this?

2218
04:34:39,380 --> 04:34:42,580
My first person to train I can

2219
04:34:43,619 --> 04:34:50,139
Like it matters

2220
04:34:50,139 --> 04:35:20,389
my poor horse

2221
04:35:20,389 --> 04:35:23,189
So we're but it all takes us back to the city

2222
04:35:24,970 --> 04:35:26,169
I guess

2223
04:35:26,169 --> 04:35:37,380
It's fine

2224
04:35:37,380 --> 04:35:44,299
Okay, what if I get robbed?

2225
04:35:44,299 --> 04:35:46,299
What if somebody tries to stop this train?

2226
04:35:46,779 --> 04:36:00,790
How would they stop this they wouldn't

2227
04:36:04,470 --> 04:36:09,369
Hey

2228
04:36:09,369 --> 04:36:11,369
Just keep going around in a circle

2229
04:36:12,250 --> 04:36:14,169
Just don't stop

2230
04:36:14,169 --> 04:36:23,139
I can't go faster as fast as I can go

2231
04:36:31,500 --> 04:36:33,500
What about other trains

2232
04:36:35,990 --> 04:36:37,909
Can I back up?

2233
04:36:37,909 --> 04:36:39,590
Into another train

2234
04:36:39,590 --> 04:36:42,840
What's happening over there?

2235
04:36:42,840 --> 04:36:44,439
Oh, it's an alligator

2236
04:36:44,439 --> 04:36:49,430
There's a legendary fish over here

2237
04:37:08,630 --> 04:37:10,759
Um

2238
04:37:10,759 --> 04:37:12,759
I think somebody might get in the way

2239
04:37:14,900 --> 04:37:16,900
This train don't stop for nobody

2240
04:37:17,619 --> 04:37:37,400
You understand?

2241
04:37:37,400 --> 04:37:39,560
How annoying am I being right now?

2242
04:38:15,580 --> 04:38:17,580
What

2243
04:38:19,020 --> 04:38:43,849
I mean, I have to hit somebody with the train

2244
04:38:44,569 --> 04:38:49,349
You know, I like I can't go this far into this populated city and not just run a person over

2245
04:38:50,310 --> 04:38:58,020
We need to do like maximum overdrive and just wait for somebody to get in the way and then fucking hit the gas

2246
04:39:11,259 --> 04:39:16,779
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Everybody fucking hold on. Hold on

2247
04:39:29,430 --> 04:39:30,630
Wait

2248
04:39:30,630 --> 04:39:37,500
Wait, wait, wait, you think you're gonna get the train?

2249
04:39:38,139 --> 04:39:39,979
That's not gonna happen

2250
04:39:39,979 --> 04:39:42,939
I'm gonna tie up like 50 people and put them on tracks and then driving

2251
04:39:43,900 --> 04:39:52,869
I need to save the game here man, because this is a this is

2252
04:39:53,750 --> 04:39:57,020
This potential here. Oh, I can't save

2253
04:39:57,740 --> 04:40:08,549
They're never gonna stop me ever

2254
04:40:09,270 --> 04:40:15,669
I can go right back. What are they gonna do get on the train?

2255
04:40:16,630 --> 04:40:31,299
I hope they find me

2256
04:40:31,299 --> 04:40:33,139
Wanted Arthur Morgan

2257
04:40:33,139 --> 04:40:38,150
investigating

2258
04:40:38,150 --> 04:40:39,909
Oh, damn it

2259
04:40:39,909 --> 04:40:47,590
They don't know where I am. I'm hiding in plain sight

2260
04:40:48,229 --> 04:40:50,500
the guy on the train

2261
04:40:50,500 --> 04:40:59,139
When somebody cross

2262
04:40:59,139 --> 04:41:12,939
Cross over with that wagon that found me

2263
04:41:15,099 --> 04:41:19,659
Yeah, but i've been i'm in a giant armored vehicle what you're gonna do

2264
04:41:44,740 --> 04:41:46,740
Wanted searching

2265
04:41:46,819 --> 04:42:03,799
No, he's on me

2266
04:42:03,799 --> 04:42:05,419
Damn it

2267
04:42:05,419 --> 04:42:07,419
Watch out. Here he comes again

2268
04:42:08,220 --> 04:42:10,220
He's a psycho

2269
04:42:10,380 --> 04:42:31,799
Did I get him? I got him. Where are you going?

2270
04:42:32,840 --> 04:42:42,250
Oh, I so badly want to be able to turn this around

2271
04:42:43,529 --> 04:42:50,380
I feel like I can't give up this opportunity

2272
04:42:51,099 --> 04:43:03,909
See, i'm just a train right now. Okay. I don't know. I'm I am a train

2273
04:43:04,630 --> 04:43:09,180
I need someone to cross this

2274
04:43:09,500 --> 04:43:40,659
I need a carriage

2275
04:43:40,659 --> 04:43:42,659
That's so important

2276
04:43:47,509 --> 04:43:58,840
I feel like we keep rewinding the same video

2277
04:43:59,720 --> 04:44:07,270
Come on. Come on. Come on

2278
04:44:09,500 --> 04:44:20,360
Damn it

2279
04:44:20,360 --> 04:44:22,360
Just so badly trying to shoot in here

2280
04:44:23,000 --> 04:44:24,759
It's not gonna happen

2281
04:44:24,759 --> 04:44:28,540
Easy easy with that horse

2282
04:44:47,669 --> 04:44:50,069
People are never gonna trust this train ever again

2283
04:45:05,380 --> 04:45:09,610
What's that what is that?

2284
04:45:44,569 --> 04:45:47,799
Never read it's never gonna end

2285
04:46:04,229 --> 04:46:06,759
Get him

2286
04:46:06,759 --> 04:46:09,130
Watch out for that horse

2287
04:46:11,049 --> 04:46:15,770
That guy just shot a random person that person had nothing to do with it

2288
04:46:19,240 --> 04:46:41,689
I have to get out of here. This has to stop at some point, right?

2289
04:46:44,939 --> 04:46:48,700
It's just gonna go on the sun has set like twice

2290
04:46:51,799 --> 04:46:53,799
The sun has gone down now

2291
04:46:56,520 --> 04:47:00,659
For like two days, I can't figure out how to stop him

2292
04:47:14,279 --> 04:47:19,209
My fucking back hurts

2293
04:47:19,900 --> 04:47:21,900
Oh, they hit me. They're actually hitting me

2294
04:47:22,619 --> 04:47:29,459
Where's my horse?

2295
04:47:29,459 --> 04:47:31,060
Horses over there

2296
04:47:31,060 --> 04:47:37,049
Can you see him?

2297
04:47:37,049 --> 04:47:40,490
You see he's fine. He's over there. He's fine. He made it see him down there

2298
04:47:48,470 --> 04:47:51,540
I think I ran a guy over

2299
04:47:54,299 --> 04:47:56,299
Yeah, yeah

2300
04:48:40,680 --> 04:48:51,220
Lucky bastard i'm bleeding

2301
04:48:55,479 --> 04:48:57,479
I just hit a seagull

2302
04:48:58,119 --> 04:49:05,189
I hit a seagull

2303
04:49:05,189 --> 04:49:07,189
All right. This is the last ride

2304
04:49:07,509 --> 04:49:09,959
I'm just gonna scrape through

2305
04:49:09,959 --> 04:49:18,150
I need to do this right though

2306
04:49:18,470 --> 04:49:21,419
I gotta do this, right?

2307
04:49:21,419 --> 04:49:25,580
I'm gonna wait till i'm not a wanted man anymore. I have to run over a carriage. I have to

2308
04:49:26,220 --> 04:49:30,139
I can't have this fucking god powers without ramming into a carriage

2309
04:49:30,939 --> 04:49:41,700
So we're about to lose our wanted level here. Okay, nice new carriage come back

2310
04:49:43,750 --> 04:49:46,069
Put my fucking Satan powers that I have right here

2311
04:49:53,849 --> 04:49:55,849
Why would you do that get out of the way?

2312
04:49:58,759 --> 04:50:01,000
I don't want to hit you. I want to run over a carriage

2313
04:50:07,319 --> 04:50:09,610
Carriage coming

2314
04:50:09,610 --> 04:50:11,450

2316
04:50:13,209 --> 04:50:20,939
Here comes across

2317
04:50:20,939 --> 04:50:22,220

04:50:26,680 --> 04:50:29,430
Incoming cross over there

2321
04:50:30,340 --> 04:50:37,400

2322
04:50:37,400 --> 04:50:39,209

They're about to run out of road real quick here

2325
04:50:58,250 --> 04:51:09,189
They're gonna go left

2326
04:51:09,189 --> 04:51:10,630
Where does it cross?

2327
04:51:10,630 --> 04:51:19,529
Does anybody cross here with a carriage?

2328
04:51:23,700 --> 04:51:25,700

I'm getting out of my turtle shell here for a second

2331
04:51:33,000 --> 04:51:55,909
I already touched this

2332
04:51:56,069 --> 04:52:03,259

That one like a huge one. I'm gonna line up three of them

2336
04:52:16,950 --> 04:52:24,569
You got some problems there friends. It's his fault. I can't move you. I can't like make you go the other way

2337
04:52:26,580 --> 04:52:32,790
Look out that one's not big enough. I need there. Here we go

2338
04:52:43,860 --> 04:52:52,779
Okay, i'm gonna need that wagon that ain't right what you're doing

2339
04:52:53,340 --> 04:53:07,990
This thing is fast

2340
04:53:07,990 --> 04:53:32,380
I need that get out of that

2341
04:53:32,380 --> 04:53:34,380
Oh fucking hit it in the head

2342
04:53:34,700 --> 04:53:36,700
What did it what where did this go?

2343
04:53:40,840 --> 04:53:43,560
The horse ran away, of course

2344
04:53:47,900 --> 04:53:57,099
Get in the train come on get back in the turtle shell the horses are fucking running away with them drive it quick before they get on

2345
04:53:57,740 --> 04:54:25,380
I wish I could reach up

2346
04:54:28,549 --> 04:54:32,520
No, i'm getting out of here

2347
04:54:33,479 --> 04:54:37,880
A lot of people just died. I'm dragging this guy that guy's stuck in the train

2348
04:54:39,000 --> 04:54:41,000
I think he's stuck on it still

2349
04:54:41,610 --> 04:54:46,250
Is he still on it?

2350
04:54:46,250 --> 04:54:48,409
I won't miss this train. Is that what this lady's saying?

2351
04:54:49,130 --> 04:54:58,580
I gotta I gotta get to a

2352
04:54:58,580 --> 04:55:00,500
car crossing

2353
04:55:00,500 --> 04:55:19,209
Oh, he's gonna get to a place where the carriages come

2354
04:55:20,979 --> 04:55:23,619
I'm going to run over every single

2355
04:55:24,819 --> 04:55:48,700
How could they possibly lose you because they don't understand that

2356
04:55:49,259 --> 04:55:52,220
I'm in the train, so i'm technically under cover

2357
04:55:53,580 --> 04:56:03,560
I'm just gonna get to a crossing

2358
04:56:04,540 --> 04:56:06,139
Wherever that may be

2359
04:56:06,139 --> 04:56:13,849
I think it really is

2360
04:56:13,849 --> 04:56:23,060
So now he's just gonna come across

2361
04:56:23,860 --> 04:56:27,319
Across what?

2362
04:56:29,619 --> 04:56:31,619
I've definitely seen at least one or two

2363
04:56:32,740 --> 04:56:47,459
Which way does it go? Can I direct which way it goes?

2364
04:56:48,580 --> 04:56:52,740
I don't think I can

2365
04:56:52,740 --> 04:56:57,830
But is that track for another train?

2366
04:56:57,830 --> 04:57:06,630
Um, somebody's tell me if i'm wrong here, but is this can I crash into the other train?

2367
04:57:07,990 --> 04:57:17,819
Is that just not gonna happen?

2368
04:57:17,819 --> 04:57:25,529
Oh, we're going way up in wilderness here. I'm not sure if we're gonna make it

2369
04:57:27,689 --> 04:57:31,209
Oh, we're going all the way up all the way. Where this is we're going deep

2370
04:57:32,330 --> 04:57:39,430
Be on here for a while

2371
04:57:39,430 --> 04:57:51,380
Rainfall you up not down

2372
04:58:12,169 --> 04:58:15,610
Oh

2373
04:58:39,619 --> 04:58:41,619
I'm stopping a train

2374
04:58:42,099 --> 04:58:47,319
That was a little too late

2375
04:58:47,319 --> 04:58:59,400
Wait, I just want to loot them. Well, yeah, I didn't want to scare them. I just I was

2376
04:59:00,119 --> 04:59:02,279
Getting off of a train and it was too late

2377
04:59:03,000 --> 04:59:11,299
What'd you have?

2378
04:59:11,299 --> 04:59:13,299
What were you going to give me for doing this?

2379
04:59:16,700 --> 04:59:17,819
a tonic

2380
04:59:17,819 --> 04:59:24,790
What about you? I think I didn't have anything

2381
04:59:41,779 --> 04:59:44,580
Yeah, somebody somebody is is guessing the thing that i'm doing

2382
04:59:45,830 --> 04:59:48,549
This is the fucking death train at now guys

2383
04:59:51,319 --> 04:59:53,319
We're filling this train with passengers

2384
05:00:02,840 --> 05:00:06,439
No amount of blood and death will be able to suffice this train

2385
05:00:08,759 --> 05:00:12,299
I'm gonna fill i'm gonna fill it until there's no more room

2386
05:00:13,700 --> 05:00:17,060
Like it's a storage house like a where like one of those storage units

2387
05:00:27,049 --> 05:00:51,500
How I wonder if I dedicate myself to this if I can fill this with people it's worth a shot

2388
05:00:53,580 --> 05:01:00,229
Uh, and we have derailed at this point we have i'm gonna crash the ps4

2389
05:01:01,029 --> 05:01:06,709
so be it

2390
05:01:06,709 --> 05:01:09,909
This is punt a bunch of animals put a bunch of animals and people

2391
05:01:10,709 --> 05:01:14,599
This is just like the angel of death like satan's express

2392
05:01:15,240 --> 05:01:19,060
I'm gonna fill this with fucking elks and bears and people

2393
05:01:20,500 --> 05:01:26,479
Noah's ark we're just gonna drive the train around and pick up the unsuspecting

2394
05:01:27,080 --> 05:01:35,840
bastards

2395
05:01:36,020 --> 05:01:38,020
No, don't die don't become one of them

2396
05:01:42,650 --> 05:01:45,689
Hey, see you guys in like four hours when there's 200 people on the train

2397
05:01:48,860 --> 05:01:52,700
I'm gonna come to like a stop and they're all gonna go flying out

2398
05:01:54,009 --> 05:01:56,009
It's going to be a disaster

2399
05:02:08,409 --> 05:02:10,650
Because they can't they can't stop me. You know what i'm saying?

2400
05:02:11,459 --> 05:02:13,220
I cannot be stopped

2401
05:02:13,220 --> 05:02:15,540
The only way that I can be stopped here is if these people despawn

2402
05:02:16,099 --> 05:02:27,419
We'll find out now. They're still in there

2403
05:02:31,240 --> 05:02:33,240
They're still in there

2404
05:02:33,479 --> 05:02:35,700
That's a go baby

2405
05:02:35,700 --> 05:02:37,700
Welcome to the welcome to the street

2406
05:02:37,779 --> 05:02:53,959
I want to see if I put a hundred people here

2407
05:02:54,439 --> 05:02:56,680
Yeah, i'm gonna i'm gonna make one slot specific for this

2408
05:02:57,639 --> 05:03:03,340
because this is the

2409
05:03:03,580 --> 05:03:07,110
Let me just get this straight

2410
05:03:07,110 --> 05:03:10,389
This is the one that was just the the actual video game, right?

2411
05:03:20,470 --> 05:03:22,709
Because whatever this one is, what is it gonna be called?

2412
05:03:25,139 --> 05:03:29,380
Because I want to make sure I can go back to the actual game after this nonsense. Here's the problem

2413
05:03:29,459 --> 05:03:34,040
Let's make sure it didn't fuck up

2414
05:03:34,040 --> 05:03:36,200
They still here. Oh, yeah, they're still here

2415
05:03:41,689 --> 05:03:43,689
You you see animals

2416
05:03:44,310 --> 05:04:09,029
People of course somewhere they'll be fine anybody up there any humans up there

2417
05:04:09,830 --> 05:04:17,380
Remember and anyone is welcome

2418
05:04:18,389 --> 05:04:20,709
Oh, yeah. Hey, we got another passenger

2419
05:04:22,169 --> 05:04:24,169
You know what? I mean when you see a new passenger

2420
05:04:24,970 --> 05:04:31,590
Oh, we've got quite a few passengers here, don't we?

2421
05:04:32,229 --> 05:04:40,729
How many?

2422
05:04:40,729 --> 05:04:56,500
Hmm

2423
05:04:56,500 --> 05:05:01,849
I'm gonna go too far

2424
05:05:01,849 --> 05:05:04,729
Because they might despawn if I go too far now that I think about that

2425
05:05:08,090 --> 05:05:09,290
Let's find out

2426
05:05:09,290 --> 05:05:11,779
Train's still there. Mm-hmm

2427
05:05:13,610 --> 05:05:47,459
Can't tell if it's still in there though

2428
05:05:47,459 --> 05:05:50,389
Don't worry. I'll take care of it after

2429
05:05:50,389 --> 05:05:51,830
They're still on the train

2430
05:05:51,830 --> 05:06:04,919
I'm gonna lead them back here

2431
05:06:04,919 --> 05:06:06,919
I wish I had better guns

2432
05:06:08,279 --> 05:06:41,990
We got here

2433
05:06:41,990 --> 05:06:43,990
Okay, quick quick quickly quickly

2434
05:06:44,310 --> 05:07:58,709
Let's go

2435
05:07:58,709 --> 05:08:00,790
Here's the thing though. I can't die

2436
05:08:01,590 --> 05:08:03,590
I gotta be very very aware of my health

2437
05:08:13,209 --> 05:08:15,209
If I die the whole thing is over

2438
05:08:37,500 --> 05:08:39,500
The train it hungers

2439
05:08:41,830 --> 05:08:44,470
Just i'm gonna see i'm gonna save after every major, uh

2440
05:08:45,580 --> 05:08:51,270
Soul gathering

2441
05:08:51,270 --> 05:08:53,590
One body pre well, we can deal with logistics later

2442
05:08:54,389 --> 05:08:56,389
You understand?

2443
05:09:06,540 --> 05:09:10,500
He dead we can set them up

2444
05:09:11,319 --> 05:09:12,119
later

2445
05:09:12,119 --> 05:09:20,860
Just gotta get enough people in it

2446
05:09:20,860 --> 05:09:23,400
one person per seat

2447
05:09:23,400 --> 05:09:25,400
One person and one animal per seat

2448
05:09:25,799 --> 05:09:45,560
What time is it like 11 o'clock eastern?

2449
05:09:47,349 --> 05:09:49,909
All right. I'm gonna give this until

2450
05:09:49,909 --> 05:09:57,270
But okay siri remind me in 20 minutes what my progress is on the soul train like the ghost train

2451
05:09:58,069 --> 05:10:27,369
All right

2452
05:10:30,180 --> 05:10:32,180
I'll sit here and feed it all day

2453
05:10:38,340 --> 05:10:40,659
It auto-aimed the horse's head. I didn't do that

2454
05:10:41,459 --> 05:10:43,060
Oh that hurts

2455
05:10:43,060 --> 05:10:51,319
What was that?

2456
05:10:53,180 --> 05:11:08,869
Fuck if only I had my other weapons

2457
05:11:11,560 --> 05:11:28,869
Bitch if only I didn't run my fucking horse over

2458
05:11:30,069 --> 05:11:33,259
Actually, this is pretty good. I'm not i'm okay with this

2459
05:11:34,220 --> 05:11:42,900
Take their weapons

2460
05:11:42,900 --> 05:11:44,580
Why did I not even think about that?

2461
05:11:44,580 --> 05:12:17,189
I have a lot of bodies to loot. That's for sure

2462
05:12:17,189 --> 05:12:26,139
Well, we're gonna test the power of the playstation 4. Can they fall out the windows? I don't think so

2463
05:12:26,619 --> 05:12:40,250
Now I need to get I need to get some big bulky animals in there. I'm talking big elk deer alligators

2464
05:12:42,419 --> 05:12:48,250
It's just noah's ark. Yeah, i'm not gonna cause any more trouble here. I'm gonna save and i'm gonna take off

2465
05:12:49,220 --> 05:12:51,220
Like from this place

2466
05:13:06,009 --> 05:13:08,729
Can you pick up the big animals not bears and everything

2467
05:13:14,520 --> 05:13:18,119
Yeah, i'm sorry for the for the next at least 30 minutes of this stream

2468
05:13:19,560 --> 05:13:22,759
I kind of have to do this though. This is the only opportunity i'm ever gonna have

2469
05:13:23,400 --> 05:13:27,509
I just dumped somebody's head

2470
05:13:27,509 --> 05:13:44,740
I heard somebody over here

2471
05:13:44,740 --> 05:14:02,259
Like turkeys these people are investigating. I was gonna go in there. Did you hear that?

2472
05:14:02,819 --> 05:14:07,639
Holy shit

2473
05:14:07,639 --> 05:14:09,779
You're lucky

2474
05:14:09,779 --> 05:14:19,830
You're lucky. We gotta move on from this stop

2475
05:14:26,520 --> 05:14:28,759
I do I do want to go. I do have to pick up a gun though. That's all right

2476
05:14:29,560 --> 05:14:33,020
Somebody's getting up

2477
05:14:36,840 --> 05:14:38,680
We're attracting

2478
05:14:38,680 --> 05:14:41,639
Like once you get on you're not allowed to get off

2479
05:15:03,639 --> 05:15:14,900
You know what he signed up for

2480
05:15:14,900 --> 05:15:16,900
I'm gonna attract so many

2481
05:15:17,779 --> 05:15:19,779
Bears are gonna come in here

2482
05:15:19,779 --> 05:15:25,060
Animals are gonna come over here. This is gonna be fucking so ridiculous if they stay here

2483
05:15:26,409 --> 05:15:31,290
I don't even need to go hunting. There's gonna be animals in here every single every five minutes

2484
05:15:31,770 --> 05:15:39,770
There's gonna be a bear will come in here

2485
05:15:39,930 --> 05:15:42,430
It's gonna be so many predators

2486
05:15:44,139 --> 05:15:46,459
I'm gonna get like eaten by a bear in the train

2487
05:15:47,709 --> 05:15:49,310
Mark my words

2488
05:15:49,310 --> 05:15:53,950
All right, we gotta get out of here one more guy down there and that's it. We're gonna move

2489
05:15:57,919 --> 05:16:03,360
Well, yeah, what happened in the old journal? You know the guy that used to run into people and laugh and scream

2490
05:16:05,869 --> 05:16:09,639
You sure you wanted that?

2491
05:16:09,639 --> 05:16:11,560
Be careful what you wish for

2492
05:16:11,560 --> 05:16:25,880
You know, you just might get it

2493
05:16:27,200 --> 05:16:29,200
More food for the fucking train

2494
05:16:30,080 --> 05:16:49,000
I'm about to see that guy knows it's that guy knows what's up. That guy doesn't have to become food

2495
05:16:54,970 --> 05:16:56,970
Well, maybe he does

2496
05:16:57,130 --> 05:17:03,369
Maybe he does

2497
05:17:03,369 --> 05:17:05,369
Wait, whose dog is this?

2498
05:17:05,610 --> 05:17:07,610
Why is there a dog in here?

2499
05:17:07,610 --> 05:17:09,610
Hey, what are you in here?

2500
05:17:11,229 --> 05:17:12,750
Get out of here

2501
05:17:12,750 --> 05:17:14,750
Technically, he's not in the train

2502
05:17:14,830 --> 05:17:17,360
He's not in the train yet

2503
05:17:17,360 --> 05:17:18,799
Get out of here

2504
05:17:18,799 --> 05:17:21,400
You need to get out of here

2505
05:17:21,400 --> 05:17:23,400
You need to don't step in this train

2506
05:17:24,720 --> 05:17:27,790
Out don't go in there

2507
05:17:28,250 --> 05:17:31,259
Don't go in there. I'm gonna tell you you're not gonna want to be in there

2508
05:17:37,069 --> 05:17:40,110
What the fuck? How did you get in? I don't perfect

2509
05:17:40,830 --> 05:17:43,439
I'm gonna pick him up

2510
05:17:43,439 --> 05:17:52,270
Get out of here. It's a oh, it's a fox

2511
05:17:58,029 --> 05:18:00,330
Well, what would happen?

2512
05:18:03,229 --> 05:18:04,669
That's everybody right?

2513
05:18:04,669 --> 05:18:05,709
Yep

2514
05:18:05,709 --> 05:18:07,240
Okay

2515
05:18:07,240 --> 05:18:23,880
Time to leave the station. Is the fox still there?

2516
05:18:28,409 --> 05:18:32,779
Hey get

2517
05:18:32,779 --> 05:18:49,689
Get excuse me. This is not gonna end well for you, man

2518
05:18:54,380 --> 05:18:57,639
Is he just gonna ride with me?

2519
05:18:57,639 --> 05:19:02,669
Okay

2520
05:19:02,669 --> 05:19:04,330
and so

2521
05:19:04,330 --> 05:19:07,630
The death train moves on to its next destination

2522
05:19:08,250 --> 05:19:14,080
He's not gonna fall off. I guess

2523
05:19:14,159 --> 05:19:16,060
He's just hanging out

2524
05:19:16,060 --> 05:19:22,840
I'm so concerned about him though

2525
05:19:23,319 --> 05:19:31,319
Well, is he gone?

2526
05:19:31,319 --> 05:19:33,319
Wait, wait, where is he? Where is he? Is he gone?

2527
05:19:36,720 --> 05:19:38,159
No, he's still there

2528
05:19:38,159 --> 05:19:43,799
Come to the next town

2529
05:19:43,799 --> 05:19:47,130
There's a witness investigating

2530
05:19:49,340 --> 05:19:52,040
Really? No

2531
05:19:52,040 --> 05:19:54,040
Where would that where would that be?

2532
05:19:55,290 --> 05:19:57,290
Save the game. Uh-huh

2533
05:20:02,279 --> 05:20:05,159
I can't

2534
05:20:05,159 --> 05:20:07,000
Here's the problem with this

2535
05:20:07,000 --> 05:20:10,520
I'll give you one issue

2536
05:20:10,520 --> 05:20:12,520
With a game save it doesn't matter

2537
05:20:14,090 --> 05:20:16,090
It's gonna put me leaning up against a tree somewhere

2538
05:20:21,759 --> 05:20:30,400
You all know it

2539
05:20:30,560 --> 05:20:32,560
Have I get followed by vultures?

2540
05:21:08,009 --> 05:21:11,720
You did you've survived that

2541
05:21:11,720 --> 05:21:13,479
Really?

2542
05:21:13,479 --> 05:21:21,659
Fucking bullshit

2543
05:21:21,659 --> 05:21:27,000
I gotta go

2544
05:21:27,000 --> 05:21:28,680
Mr. Fox

2545
05:21:28,680 --> 05:21:39,400
Full speed ahead. Oh the passenger is still in there

2546
05:21:40,200 --> 05:21:53,840
Why is this guy trying to keep up with me?

2547
05:22:05,869 --> 05:22:07,869
You cannot stop death

2548
05:22:08,029 --> 05:22:18,110
I can't feel the train here, man. It's too dangerous

2549
05:22:18,990 --> 05:22:22,520
I just gotta get out of here

2550
05:22:22,520 --> 05:22:28,490
Under the train right now. Why do I hear glass breaking?

2551
05:22:29,290 --> 05:22:32,299
There's so many police

2552
05:22:32,700 --> 05:22:37,560
They're just running into the train

2553
05:22:38,119 --> 05:22:40,119
They're sprinting into the train

2554
05:22:40,840 --> 05:22:42,840
They've lost all control

2555
05:22:42,840 --> 05:22:53,799
Holy shit

2556
05:22:53,799 --> 05:22:55,799
Oh my god

2557
05:22:58,139 --> 05:23:01,439
It calls to them

2558
05:23:01,439 --> 05:23:03,439
Almost all over the sky

2559
05:23:05,259 --> 05:23:07,259
And then we get up and just pick the blood

2560
05:23:12,619 --> 05:23:18,509
We've got a train to beat

2561
05:23:18,509 --> 05:23:21,069
Now they're freaking out. I'm now I just became a train

2562
05:23:21,869 --> 05:23:23,150
Nothing else

2563
05:23:23,150 --> 05:23:29,520
I don't have to move

2564
05:23:29,520 --> 05:23:32,860
I'm a train

2565
05:23:32,860 --> 05:23:35,880

2566
05:23:35,880 --> 05:23:38,119

I can't go

2570
05:23:47,279 --> 05:23:49,119
I'm gonna die

2571
05:23:49,119 --> 05:23:50,639
I can't move

2572
05:23:50,639 --> 05:23:52,639
Oh, it's over. It's over

2573
05:24:10,299 --> 05:24:12,299
I didn't work this fucking hard to have this happen

2574
05:24:24,669 --> 05:24:26,029
Two trains

2575
05:24:26,029 --> 05:24:30,189
Two trains

2576
05:24:30,189 --> 05:24:32,349
I can't move this train won't move down

2577
05:24:32,990 --> 05:24:55,840
Here we go get the bodies. I I can't stick around there man. I gotta get out. I get a good way

2578
05:24:57,119 --> 05:25:00,959
There's a whole nother train of people over there. I'm just gonna transfer them to this one

2579
05:25:02,080 --> 05:25:37,360
You still there? Hey buddy. All right, how my core is doing?

2580
05:25:37,919 --> 05:25:43,369
I'm like running out of food

2581
05:25:43,369 --> 05:25:50,889
Can you hear the flies?

2582
05:25:50,889 --> 05:25:56,639
So yeah, we're just gonna transfer this is the transfer station

2583
05:25:57,279 --> 05:26:31,119
Are there people in here?

2584
05:26:31,200 --> 05:26:33,500
Come on

2585
05:26:43,049 --> 05:26:50,939
Okay, the conductor and put him in i'm gonna put him in the engine room

2586
05:27:03,150 --> 05:27:05,650
The fox just defended his territory

2587
05:27:14,919 --> 05:27:16,919
Reproducing

2588
05:27:19,529 --> 05:27:25,450
I'm gonna put him in the conductor seat with me. Can I even get him up there? I can't

2589
05:27:31,659 --> 05:27:33,959
Oh

2590
05:27:35,000 --> 05:27:37,720
He's defending I love the fact that this is his house now

2591
05:27:38,439 --> 05:27:41,479
A raccoon came over and he's like get out of here. This is my train

2592
05:27:42,360 --> 05:27:43,319
uh

2593
05:27:43,319 --> 05:27:51,180
I can study him again

2594
05:27:51,180 --> 05:27:53,259
Are there a bunch of passengers on here though for real?

2595
05:27:58,750 --> 05:28:01,630
That has to be right

2596
05:28:01,630 --> 05:28:03,630
Somebody would be taking the train

2597
05:28:06,540 --> 05:28:08,380
Is there nobody on here?

2598
05:28:08,380 --> 05:28:18,090
I don't think I can

2599
05:28:18,090 --> 05:28:53,020
What the hell is this guy doing here? He's guarding the train

2600
05:28:54,240 --> 05:28:56,139
well

2601
05:28:56,139 --> 05:28:59,659
Uh, sorry, I mean, I don't think you guard a train from the boiler room

2602
05:29:20,639 --> 05:29:22,639
Go get the engineer's hat

2603
05:29:29,709 --> 05:29:31,709
There there's another fox

2604
05:29:34,110 --> 05:29:36,110
He's died

2605
05:29:36,110 --> 05:29:41,229
He can't move his head is stuck. I gotta help him. How do I help him? How do I get him out of there?

2606
05:29:42,029 --> 05:29:44,250
Oh shit

2607
05:29:44,250 --> 05:29:47,709
Is he okay?

2608
05:29:47,950 --> 05:29:50,569
I think

2609
05:29:50,569 --> 05:29:54,479
Free him. I don't I don't know where he is. Which one is he under?

2610
05:29:55,200 --> 05:30:08,569
Oh, they're going through the train. They're going through the train now

2611
05:30:09,209 --> 05:30:14,810
Shit, I think that they're actually falling through the train when I pick him up like that

2612
05:30:19,479 --> 05:30:21,479
The corpses are just rotting out

2613
05:30:21,560 --> 05:30:30,479
I gotta be quick

2614
05:30:30,479 --> 05:30:36,090
Bodies decomposing

2615
05:30:36,090 --> 05:30:37,689
I I don't maybe not

2616
05:30:37,689 --> 05:30:43,770
I think it's because I picked him up and put him back down

2617
05:30:44,090 --> 05:30:48,380
All right. Hey, I need you to get out of the way

2618
05:30:48,380 --> 05:30:51,520
I gotta get to the front of the train

2619
05:30:51,520 --> 05:30:54,520
He's covered in blood. He's been eating them

2620
05:30:56,319 --> 05:30:57,599
Excuse me

2621
05:30:57,599 --> 05:31:06,279
Look at his face. Hold on. I got a perfect opportunity

2622
05:31:07,240 --> 05:31:09,240
For a fucking family photo

2623
05:31:09,560 --> 05:31:37,240
I can't okay. Here we go. I actually can't like get in a good spot because I can't crouch

2624
05:31:38,040 --> 05:31:40,040
I can't do handheld and crouched

2625
05:31:40,439 --> 05:31:42,439
That's bullshit. Why?

2626
05:31:58,159 --> 05:32:00,159
I can't really get the image that I want

2627
05:32:15,759 --> 05:32:23,799
That's so annoying I have to be like sloppily facing the right direction

2628
05:32:24,680 --> 05:32:33,520
He's inside inside the train

2629
05:32:34,970 --> 05:32:37,549
Is he though?

2630
05:32:37,549 --> 05:33:03,209
Oh, no, I don't make the rules. I can make an exception

2631
05:33:04,520 --> 05:33:08,139
Are we gonna move on to the next town? I guess I they're gonna start to despawn here

2632
05:33:08,860 --> 05:33:10,810
unless

2633
05:33:10,810 --> 05:33:12,810
No, there are no passengers on that

2634
05:33:14,560 --> 05:33:18,430
Let's go

2635
05:33:18,430 --> 05:33:31,950
We need fresh blood for a second. I thought I had the wrong train

2636
05:33:32,669 --> 05:33:41,259
A little bit settlement. It's not a major town

2637
05:33:42,380 --> 05:34:03,360
We're a bunch of animals. It's kind of fun

2638
05:34:04,400 --> 05:34:18,889
All right, you can cross

2639
05:34:18,889 --> 05:34:21,500
Found our place

2640
05:34:21,500 --> 05:34:23,500
Witness investigate

2641
05:34:23,659 --> 05:34:27,900
Are these are these lawyers? Are these if these are lawyers?

2642
05:34:33,520 --> 05:35:00,590
I got some more food for you

2643
05:35:02,119 --> 05:35:03,159
Hello

2644
05:35:03,159 --> 05:35:04,700
Watch out

2645
05:35:04,700 --> 05:35:09,819
Dinner's here

2646
05:35:09,819 --> 05:35:11,819
Don't you dare bite your dad?

2647
05:35:17,040 --> 05:35:39,979
Feed me Seymour. I don't like him being right here though. I feel like i'm gonna step on him. Okay, let's keep on

2648
05:35:40,459 --> 05:35:50,830
It might be time for a little bit of wildlife

2649
05:35:50,909 --> 05:35:56,599
Good spot for that though

2650
05:35:57,000 --> 05:35:59,000
Name the fox

2651
05:35:59,000 --> 05:36:00,200
Francis

2652
05:36:00,200 --> 05:36:18,619
Francis the fox

2653
05:36:19,819 --> 05:36:24,939
Why do you take another 10 to 15 people?

2654
05:36:25,900 --> 05:36:34,990
I i'm not gonna get out

2655
05:36:36,349 --> 05:36:40,830
Why there are like eight

2656
05:36:41,229 --> 05:36:51,759
Let's do it. I don't give a shit about the meat quality

2657
05:36:52,479 --> 05:37:11,659
Well, I hear something. I hear somebody running around

2658
05:37:17,240 --> 05:37:18,759
Oh, there's a house

2659
05:37:18,759 --> 05:37:26,200
What is this? I don't have time to like explore

2660
05:37:38,090 --> 05:37:45,520
One squirrel one squirrel and I don't I can't even drop them. I just put them in my pocket

2661
05:37:56,860 --> 05:37:58,779
Feed Francis i'm trying I just need

2662
05:37:59,259 --> 05:38:02,119
Well, here comes somebody

2663
05:38:02,119 --> 05:38:13,799
I think it's time to get some lawmen on me here. No tell on me

2664
05:38:14,439 --> 05:38:30,279
Bring it back to the train

2665
05:38:30,279 --> 05:38:32,279
That guy got up on me quick

2666
05:38:32,759 --> 05:38:37,369
Now don't drag him. Don't drag him

2667
05:38:47,790 --> 05:38:49,790
He's on a horse. Yeah, but

2668
05:38:50,270 --> 05:38:52,569
I don't think it's gonna be that fast

2669
05:39:17,119 --> 05:39:19,360
I'm not trying. Okay. Here we go. Here they come

2670
05:39:26,509 --> 05:39:30,750
Bring them on

2671
05:39:30,750 --> 05:40:01,360
All right, load them up. It's gonna take them forever to clean this train

2672
05:40:05,200 --> 05:40:16,840
Yes, it is. He's right there. Francis. He's fine

2673
05:40:17,560 --> 05:40:19,479
He just was saying hello

2674
05:40:19,479 --> 05:40:21,659
He was like, hey, how are you? How are you?

2675
05:40:21,900 --> 05:40:33,150
Are they still investigating?

2676
05:40:33,150 --> 05:40:34,590
Apparently not

2677
05:40:34,590 --> 05:40:40,029
Oh, they're coming from this direction now

2678
05:40:41,439 --> 05:40:43,439
Might have to put them down

2679
05:40:45,310 --> 05:40:47,310
I'd rather you come in here

2680
05:40:47,389 --> 05:41:10,759
Right next to the train. Perfect. I'm gonna start moving here

2681
05:41:24,029 --> 05:41:26,029
I need some poor refilling

2682
05:41:26,509 --> 05:41:40,459
Usually tame the fox. That's pretty cool. Actually this guy's falling out

2683
05:41:41,720 --> 05:41:43,319
re

2684
05:41:43,319 --> 05:41:45,939
Recalibrate this dude

2685
05:41:56,619 --> 05:41:59,259
You know some people speed run video games

2686
05:42:00,139 --> 05:42:03,279
Do it as fast as possible

2687
05:42:03,360 --> 05:42:04,880
some people

2688
05:42:04,880 --> 05:42:07,119
Spend a lot of time getting really good and get competitive

2689
05:42:09,549 --> 05:42:14,909
Some people are you know personalities and they don't look at all the things that they say and all the funny things that they do

2690
05:42:16,599 --> 05:42:19,639
I feel trained with bodies until my playstation crashes

2691
05:42:22,680 --> 05:42:24,680
Kind of coming to these terms here

2692
05:42:31,740 --> 05:42:36,959
More oh and they're fresh too a lot of people

2693
05:42:37,360 --> 05:42:44,139
Be careful. Oh shit

2694
05:42:44,779 --> 05:43:28,029
Still here. All right. Let me do some just general maintenance here

2695
05:43:28,590 --> 05:43:47,259
How's it doing clean it up? Come on. Hurry up

2696
05:43:47,900 --> 05:43:59,520
Well here the real kicker here is to try to see if this works

2697
05:44:00,639 --> 05:44:02,360
is

2698
05:44:02,360 --> 05:44:03,400
it's

2699
05:44:03,400 --> 05:44:08,360
Then you might not be able to have more than like 50 to 30 to 50 or something bodies on the screen at the same time

2700
05:44:09,319 --> 05:44:11,720
And it'll be a thing where they just actually despawn

2701
05:44:12,759 --> 05:44:14,759
But i'm willing to give it a try

2702
05:44:15,319 --> 05:44:35,950
Right here the game is starting to hate this

2703
05:44:37,150 --> 05:44:41,869
But what point will they turn us off? You know what I mean? At what point does it not do I not get to do it anymore?

2704
05:44:44,139 --> 05:44:46,619
When is the game actually sick of my shit completely?

2705
05:44:48,090 --> 05:44:53,900
That's the real question. I think that's it. No, there's one more down here

2706
05:45:07,720 --> 05:45:10,520
Save the game save saving the game is not going to do anything

2707
05:45:11,240 --> 05:45:13,680
Because when you save a game

2708
05:45:14,000 --> 05:45:16,639
It just when you load that save it puts you

2709
05:45:17,439 --> 05:45:19,439
Oh, like you just woke up at a camp

2710
05:45:20,380 --> 05:45:25,259
Nearby it doesn't it's not like a state that you're saving. It's the time that you're saving

2711
05:45:26,619 --> 05:45:28,619
Oh, it's starting to hang

2712
05:45:31,599 --> 05:45:32,959
Starting to hang

2713
05:45:32,959 --> 05:45:41,389
That's how you know, we're getting there

2714
05:45:41,389 --> 05:45:44,779
Hey little boy all aboard. Let's go

2715
05:45:51,360 --> 05:45:54,000
What was the point of this again, uh to try to crash the game?

2716
05:45:54,560 --> 05:45:58,139
Or to see how many people I can fit in the train

2717
05:45:59,790 --> 05:46:10,889
Be either one we're about to make it to micah

2718
05:46:11,770 --> 05:46:13,290
people

2719
05:46:13,290 --> 05:46:16,040
Anybody in there?

2720
05:46:16,040 --> 05:46:20,970
I don't think so. I don't see anybody in there

2721
05:46:20,970 --> 05:46:33,150
I'm not even an animal, but you have to hunt the animals like the people come to you

2722
05:46:34,509 --> 05:46:48,830
This is actually pretty cool

2723
05:46:48,830 --> 05:46:50,590
This looks great

2724
05:46:50,590 --> 05:47:07,610
Ass on the mini back. Yeah, i'm being followed right now by even the monster

2725
05:47:08,810 --> 05:47:18,159
I just think i'm gonna gas

2726
05:47:32,080 --> 05:47:36,000
Gas well, you know what I mean. I mean like can this thing burn out all the coal

2727
05:47:37,119 --> 05:47:40,439
It's up throwing bodies in there

2728
05:47:40,680 --> 05:47:47,479
Where are we at now?

2729
05:47:47,479 --> 05:47:50,750
This looks like animal territory

2730
05:47:51,150 --> 05:47:54,349
I think it's time to put in some animals

2731
05:47:59,959 --> 05:48:06,590
How far north are we right now? We're okay. We're about to reach back around here to forward

2732
05:48:13,919 --> 05:48:16,479
I guess

2733
05:48:16,479 --> 05:48:18,479
We'll see where it takes us

2734
05:48:18,639 --> 05:48:30,319
Try putting bait in the body room. Well, aren't they already just it's a bunch of bait there already

2735
05:48:31,680 --> 05:48:46,400
We're taking the scenic route

2736
05:48:46,720 --> 05:48:50,439
I don't see any exes gone. I don't think they they're decomposing

2737
05:48:51,400 --> 05:48:53,400
What I can tell you is I can't tell you

2738
05:48:54,599 --> 05:48:56,599
This is the same as it did before

2739
05:48:57,720 --> 05:49:07,470
I wonder if there's a finite actually a lot of time

2740
05:49:08,669 --> 05:49:13,209
30 minutes 20 minutes an hour

2741
05:49:15,529 --> 05:49:18,330
Why not they might just be an entity that's like an asset that's there forever

2742
05:49:20,490 --> 05:49:24,409
I would assume when you move 100 yards 200 yards that way

2743
05:49:25,290 --> 05:49:29,630
And that would be

2744
05:49:43,439 --> 05:49:45,759
What's the joke I don't have a plan here

2745
05:49:46,720 --> 05:49:49,919
The plan is just fill it

2746
05:49:50,000 --> 05:49:53,130
Until it doesn't fill me

2747
05:49:53,130 --> 05:49:57,680
I don't have another that's that's it

2748
05:49:58,319 --> 05:50:07,520
I mean

2749
05:50:07,520 --> 05:50:09,759
I'm imagining a scenario

2750
05:50:10,159 --> 05:50:12,459
Where they never do some

2751
05:50:13,639 --> 05:50:15,950
And it is just

2752
05:50:16,029 --> 05:50:18,669
Stuffed with bodies on top of each other

2753
05:50:19,310 --> 05:50:28,590
Have to come to another town

2754
05:50:29,150 --> 05:50:37,849
Here's the stop let's see if anybody's here

2755
05:50:38,569 --> 05:50:46,750
It's a little late. I think

2756
05:50:46,750 --> 05:50:48,750
I don't think anybody is here

2757
05:50:52,479 --> 05:50:54,000
On we go

2758
05:50:54,000 --> 05:51:04,360
Don't fall off this

2759
05:51:04,360 --> 05:51:10,299
Box is still there hanging up

2760
05:51:10,299 --> 05:51:12,299
Here comes the fort i'm gonna get a lot of bodies here

2761
05:51:13,099 --> 05:51:31,450
harvesting

2762
05:51:31,450 --> 05:51:33,450
Yeah, pretty much

2763
05:51:38,909 --> 05:51:42,139
All right camp

2764
05:51:42,139 --> 05:51:43,900
I could probably get

2765
05:51:43,900 --> 05:51:48,619
Is there anybody at that camp?

2766
05:51:51,340 --> 05:51:53,419
Because I could just dump them over the edge and pick them up later

2767
05:51:54,139 --> 05:52:03,599
I mean there's a horse there

2768
05:52:03,599 --> 05:52:05,119
No, i'm not worth it

2769
05:52:05,119 --> 05:52:11,080
Not enough

2770
05:52:11,080 --> 05:52:13,240
This was Thanos's original plan

2771
05:52:14,119 --> 05:52:26,490
Uh, this is absolutely gorgeous though

2772
05:52:27,209 --> 05:52:30,009
I've been driving through so many beautiful things that I feel like i'm about to take me in

2773
05:52:46,110 --> 05:52:47,869
Still not really

2774
05:52:47,869 --> 05:52:49,709
I mean

2775
05:52:49,709 --> 05:52:51,709
Wallace station is up here

2776
05:52:52,349 --> 05:52:57,869
We'll probably get 10 to 20 more bodies at Wallace station

2777
05:53:09,549 --> 05:53:12,270
By the way, I I am so committed to this at the moment that

2778
05:53:13,229 --> 05:53:15,709
I i'm not going to stop this stream

2779
05:53:17,069 --> 05:53:19,310
Until it's satisfying

2780
05:53:20,669 --> 05:53:22,669
You understand

2781
05:53:37,400 --> 05:53:39,639
If you put if it's been this long already

2782
05:53:40,520 --> 05:53:43,419
You have to see it through

2783
05:53:43,419 --> 05:53:47,799
Could I right now be like oh it's kind of interesting. Oh, well

2784
05:53:49,319 --> 05:53:51,080
Yeah, it doesn't move on

2785
05:53:51,080 --> 05:53:52,119
No

2786
05:53:52,119 --> 05:53:53,240
What?

2787
05:53:53,240 --> 05:53:57,560
It's been like an hour and 30 minutes of doing this at least

2788
05:53:58,279 --> 05:54:06,090
What's the end game for Francis? I don't know

2789
05:54:06,810 --> 05:54:10,700
He's currently my

2790
05:54:10,700 --> 05:54:13,659
My co-conductor right now. I don't want him in that

2791
05:54:20,909 --> 05:54:22,909
Coming up on the town

2792
05:54:26,959 --> 05:54:29,900
Let's see if we can't pull a few more people

2793
05:54:30,700 --> 05:54:33,319
Actually, i'm gonna go all the way around with my horse

2794
05:54:37,439 --> 05:54:39,439
cp 985

2795
05:54:39,919 --> 05:54:42,159
The never-ending train

2796
05:54:47,000 --> 05:54:49,240
Can you actually befriend the fox? I don't think you can

2797
05:54:50,040 --> 05:54:56,060
Does anybody know how many people are actually on the train right now?

2798
05:54:58,799 --> 05:55:00,799
And I would say

2799
05:55:00,880 --> 05:55:02,459
20

2800
05:55:02,459 --> 05:55:04,220
15 25

2801
05:55:04,220 --> 05:55:16,509
No, just one just one

2802
05:55:17,900 --> 05:55:21,319
counting the fox

2803
05:55:21,319 --> 05:55:23,950
No, i'm not counting the fuck

2804
05:55:23,950 --> 05:55:25,950
It's probably like I bet you there's like 16 people

2805
05:55:26,430 --> 05:55:37,770
All right, let's roll in

2806
05:55:37,770 --> 05:55:39,369
rolling in

2807
05:55:39,369 --> 05:55:41,389
to

2808
05:55:41,389 --> 05:55:43,819
Wallace station

2809
05:55:43,819 --> 05:55:45,819
Please watch the doors on the left

2810
05:55:46,669 --> 05:55:48,189
entering

2811
05:55:48,189 --> 05:55:52,040
Wallace station

2812
05:55:52,040 --> 05:56:10,409
Check for your belongings

2813
05:56:10,409 --> 05:56:14,009
So I think it has been confirmed. I think part of that long

2814
05:56:14,569 --> 05:56:16,569
Journey there in between bodies going in

2815
05:56:18,360 --> 05:56:22,919
Uh, I think I believe that they're not going to these ones because they probably would have already

2816
05:56:58,200 --> 05:57:00,919
Oh, I can't pick him up. He's too big for me to pick up

2817
05:57:03,259 --> 05:57:05,099
Is he too big?

2818
05:57:05,099 --> 05:57:29,209
Shit, he's too big. Oh, well the train will eat it one way or another. That's true

2819
05:57:29,849 --> 05:57:43,159
I really don't

2820
05:57:43,159 --> 05:57:45,159
Whoa. Hey, hey

2821
05:57:45,159 --> 05:57:47,159
Looks like he's coming anyways

2822
05:57:47,880 --> 05:57:49,790
the train

2823
05:57:49,790 --> 05:57:52,139
Will take him

2824
05:57:52,139 --> 05:57:56,680
He's in

2825
05:57:59,479 --> 05:58:01,479
And welcome

2826
05:58:01,799 --> 05:58:06,880
To our next stop

2827
05:58:06,880 --> 05:58:08,080
Howdy

2828
05:58:08,080 --> 05:58:11,580
You're waiting for the train

2829
05:58:12,220 --> 05:58:14,700
Unfortunately, you picked the wrong train to get ready for

2830
05:58:15,740 --> 05:58:27,439
Have a nice day

2831
05:58:27,439 --> 05:58:30,159
Oh, yeah, come on man down here

2832
05:58:30,720 --> 05:58:39,020
Excuse me, francis

2833
05:58:39,020 --> 05:58:49,360
Excuse me

2834
05:58:49,840 --> 05:58:52,729
Fucking hell

2835
05:58:52,729 --> 05:58:55,290
There they come. All right. What do I got for cores? Am I good?

2836
05:58:56,009 --> 05:59:10,569
Can you use a little bit more did I i'm gonna have to craft some meat or something man

2837
05:59:11,130 --> 05:59:26,279
It's like all I got

2838
05:59:26,279 --> 05:59:41,659
Now we wait. No, I already I have meat. You're right. Come on in. Uh, oh, that's not a good sign

2839
05:59:42,139 --> 05:59:46,810
Where the law man? Let's go

2840
05:59:46,810 --> 05:59:54,439
I'm waiting for you. I'm here from the west

2841
06:00:02,189 --> 06:00:10,000
All right. Here they come. Let us will you use the cover?

2842
06:00:10,799 --> 06:00:23,930
three of them

2843
06:00:23,930 --> 06:00:25,689
more now

2844
06:00:25,689 --> 06:00:47,959
Nine feet. Let's go

2845
06:00:47,959 --> 06:00:50,040
Ah got coming in too hot

2846
06:01:03,000 --> 06:01:05,000
Just bulky ass elk in the way

2847
06:01:05,560 --> 06:01:08,700
I don't think I can go up this way anymore

2848
06:01:09,610 --> 06:01:12,409
No, I can't he's he's blocking that entrance

2849
06:01:13,130 --> 06:01:22,299
Take the lady's hat

2850
06:01:22,299 --> 06:01:29,959
You got it. I don't want to step on you. You need to be in a better splay. Yeah, get out of the way

2851
06:01:31,080 --> 06:01:34,159
I don't want to step on him

2852
06:01:34,159 --> 06:01:38,459
francis

2853
06:01:38,459 --> 06:01:41,180
All right. It's getting to a point where I can't walk through here

2854
06:01:41,900 --> 06:01:47,639
I can't i'm getting stuck. It's getting to the point where I can't stay in here

2855
06:02:00,439 --> 06:02:02,439
I gotta go through the back

2856
06:02:21,369 --> 06:02:24,119
I gotta go from the other side of the train

2857
06:02:24,119 --> 06:02:36,750
I won't be able to go in there anymore. Can I even get up from the other side? Are there stairs back here?

2858
06:02:38,029 --> 06:02:55,080
I think so

2859
06:02:55,080 --> 06:03:15,049
One two three make a count here. I got four more to put in

2860
06:03:21,119 --> 06:03:24,080
We actually have to keep track at this point because they might start despawning

2861
06:03:24,959 --> 06:03:31,159
There's definitely more than three

2862
06:03:36,540 --> 06:03:37,819
francis

2863
06:03:37,819 --> 06:03:39,340
I

2864
06:03:39,340 --> 06:04:14,669
Last guy there's so many people here

2865
06:04:18,349 --> 06:04:19,869
There's too many

2866
06:04:19,869 --> 06:04:53,470
Are there less x's? Oh no

2867
06:04:54,729 --> 06:05:03,290
They're despawning

2868
06:05:03,290 --> 06:05:06,159
No

2869
06:05:06,159 --> 06:05:11,209
So I here's what happened. Do you guys want to know the sad thing that happened here?

2870
06:05:12,919 --> 06:05:20,889
So the game because these are still actual npcs, right? What happened was

2871
06:05:22,040 --> 06:05:25,080
And I knew it was worth testing. We're trying to find out

2872
06:05:26,279 --> 06:05:27,400
it

2873
06:05:27,400 --> 06:05:30,119
There's only a certain amount of npcs that are like allowed

2874
06:05:32,169 --> 06:05:33,709
right

2875
06:05:33,709 --> 06:05:37,549
So once it gets to the point where there's too many npcs on the screen

2876
06:05:38,110 --> 06:05:46,270
It starts to remove them

2877
06:05:46,270 --> 06:05:48,909
Because it needs to make room for the other npcs that i'm calling in

2878
06:05:51,229 --> 06:05:53,389
But that doesn't mean we're not gonna have fun with the people that are here

2879
06:05:53,709 --> 06:05:56,509
So just let me get them in the right spot. I'm gonna put them all in the same spot

2880
06:05:56,509 --> 06:05:58,509
I'm gonna put dynamite down there

2881
06:06:08,669 --> 06:06:10,669
We're hitting the entity limit here

2882
06:06:19,369 --> 06:06:21,049
Oh, that's the joke

2883
06:06:21,049 --> 06:06:23,610
Well, the joke was I wonder how many people I can fit on the train

2884
06:06:24,490 --> 06:06:26,490
And I don't even know if it was necessarily a joke

2885
06:06:29,259 --> 06:06:32,569
Just wanted to see what would happen felt like doing it

2886
06:06:42,939 --> 06:06:43,979
so

2887
06:06:43,979 --> 06:06:45,740
Let's get them all

2888
06:06:45,819 --> 06:07:07,450
In one spot here

2889
06:07:07,450 --> 06:07:40,090
That's fine

2890
06:07:40,090 --> 06:07:51,560
Try putting them in a seat. I don't I really wonder what's gonna happen here though

2891
06:07:52,119 --> 06:08:07,229
There are quite a few people on here

2892
06:08:07,630 --> 06:08:22,720
I think it'll crash here

2893
06:08:22,799 --> 06:08:28,330
What the fuck somebody just sprinted by the right side of the screen. Was that my shadow? I don't even know

2894
06:08:28,409 --> 06:08:33,709
Oh god, they're starting to move. It's starting to become too much. They're starting to be mailed into one person

2895
06:08:35,049 --> 06:08:37,290
Oh boy

2896
06:08:37,290 --> 06:08:48,189
Okay, hurry up. Come on. Somebody's still alive down there. What the fuck

2897
06:08:51,340 --> 06:08:56,139
Jesus

2898
06:08:59,849 --> 06:09:03,529
This is this is demonic this is somebody said this is

2899
06:09:04,569 --> 06:09:06,569
That guy came from the ceiling

2900
06:09:17,819 --> 06:09:31,580
No, wrong way. It's almost like i'm pulling them from underneath

2901
06:09:33,150 --> 06:09:35,150
Oh, that guy is stretchy

2902
06:09:35,229 --> 06:09:39,819
You can always tell when they start to get all stretchy. This is now here comes the problem

2903
06:09:40,459 --> 06:10:05,040
I'm right here somewhere right here. It's quite the bear bait

2904
06:10:08,060 --> 06:10:14,889
Not yet, i'm gonna make sure they're right in the right pile because a couple of them are not in the boy

2905
06:10:20,000 --> 06:10:22,000
This is demonic

2906
06:10:22,400 --> 06:10:25,389
This is demonic

2907
06:10:25,389 --> 06:10:26,990
Okay. All right

2908
06:10:26,990 --> 06:10:30,349
There's only like one more person over here. I think

2909
06:10:33,099 --> 06:10:35,310
francis

2910
06:10:35,310 --> 06:10:37,369
Stay back

2911
06:10:37,369 --> 06:10:40,090
Where's this last one? I think this one on top of the train

2912
06:10:50,439 --> 06:10:58,319
Jesus

2913
06:10:58,319 --> 06:11:00,959
That guy's stuffed under upside down

2914
06:11:06,540 --> 06:11:08,540
All right, this is no this guy right here

2915
06:11:13,130 --> 06:11:19,740
Here we go

2916
06:11:19,740 --> 06:11:44,220
I don't even have I don't even have dynamite. They're despawning. Oh, shh. No, don't burn

2917
06:11:44,779 --> 06:11:45,659
No

2918
06:11:45,659 --> 06:12:26,080
Hey whisper

2919
06:12:26,080 --> 06:12:33,759
You didn't even have anything on you. Did you?

2920
06:12:33,759 --> 06:12:35,759
Don't worry. It was only a nightmare

2921
06:12:39,180 --> 06:12:40,540
Oh, all right

2922
06:12:40,540 --> 06:12:48,119
So what um, what the hell were we doing? All right, I was gonna reload the game

2923
06:12:55,130 --> 06:13:02,240
Damn, I wish I had died just didn't realize I didn't have dynamite. That was unfortunate

2924
06:13:02,799 --> 06:13:05,209
Was that worth it?

2925
06:13:05,209 --> 06:13:07,209
Let me kind of to see if it was possible

2926
06:13:15,279 --> 06:13:17,840
All right. So this is 2250. That's the autosave

2927
06:13:18,700 --> 06:13:20,700
21 41

2928
06:13:20,959 --> 06:13:33,159
I think this is it right?

2929
06:13:33,159 --> 06:13:35,709
You knew the rule

2930
06:13:35,709 --> 06:13:40,159
You were on the train

2931
06:13:40,159 --> 06:13:42,400
Yeah, so this is uh, this is the one

2932
06:13:44,830 --> 06:13:52,939
That was some pretty good stalling. You can hear the depression in his voice. You can I like really

2933
06:13:53,500 --> 06:13:55,500
I at least wanted to do dynamite there

2934
06:13:55,819 --> 06:13:57,799
I guess

2935
06:13:57,799 --> 06:14:00,360
That's my own fault for not looking through my inventory first

2936
06:14:14,459 --> 06:14:20,060
I demand a one. No, that was like almost and that was two hours. No, that wasn't that long

2937
06:14:20,459 --> 06:14:37,549
Let's redo it on pc when the body count gets to be higher

2938
06:14:38,750 --> 06:14:45,599
Do I have any soup left? No, that's gone. I was gone a while ago

2939
06:14:46,479 --> 06:14:48,479
That's before the first body went on the train

2940
06:14:51,450 --> 06:14:54,330
That was a third of your stream. I just joined at four hours when you started

2941
06:14:59,139 --> 06:15:02,959
225 bounty

2942
06:15:02,959 --> 06:15:12,119
What wrong save that's okay. So which one is it then this one?

2943
06:15:13,840 --> 06:15:18,560
The course of true love 36, but why would I get why did the tenth of a percent come from

2944
06:15:21,740 --> 06:15:25,740
It's one of these two. Uh, this is okay. I manually saved so it's 21 29

2945
06:15:28,729 --> 06:15:31,369
So it was one of these two. I guess it could just be this one

2946
06:15:37,470 --> 06:15:54,040
Yeah, I blame the oak

2947
06:15:54,040 --> 06:15:55,959
Well, thanks for um

2948
06:15:55,959 --> 06:15:57,959
Thanks for taking that journey with me everybody

2949
06:15:58,599 --> 06:16:00,919
Sorry, it didn't uh end the way that we all wanted but

2950
06:16:09,240 --> 06:16:11,240
It was worth it. It was worth taking the trip

2951
06:16:12,349 --> 06:16:20,029
I think

2952
06:16:20,669 --> 06:16:29,950
It was a fitting rp ending

2953
06:16:30,669 --> 06:16:32,669
ritual suicide

2954
06:16:34,119 --> 06:16:35,080
God

2955
06:16:35,080 --> 06:16:37,080
So where the hell am I now?

2956
06:16:38,509 --> 06:16:40,250
so

2957
06:16:40,250 --> 06:16:41,930
this was

2958
06:16:41,930 --> 06:16:43,930
What how much money do I got 14 13?

2959
06:16:44,330 --> 06:16:46,330
45 bounty sounds about right

2960
06:16:46,569 --> 06:16:53,849
You ain't scaring nobody. Oh, this is where the try. I this is where I I thought so long ago

2961
06:16:53,849 --> 06:16:56,409
I forgot I forgot about the train going back and forth a bit

2962
06:16:59,319 --> 06:17:01,319
This is where it all began. You're right

2963
06:17:01,560 --> 06:17:03,659
all right, um

2964
06:17:03,659 --> 06:17:09,099
Let me I need to go back to town the thing that I was supposed to do a long time ago

2965
06:17:09,819 --> 06:17:22,560
Look out god. It's I i've played the game in like two hours

2966
06:17:24,330 --> 06:17:28,330
I'm like trying to think about putting these people on on the train. That's like all I know

2967
06:17:29,130 --> 06:17:31,130
Where the hell is he is he in the stable?

2968
06:17:31,610 --> 06:17:42,430
You ever let this horse feed

2969
06:17:42,669 --> 06:17:45,389
I got space for you. Oh, let's bring out sonic

2970
06:17:50,220 --> 06:17:53,580
Yeah, let's give it a a good a good package. Absolutely

2971
06:17:54,220 --> 06:18:00,759
good decision

2972
06:18:00,759 --> 06:18:05,080
The autoslave side already contains the course of do you want to override? Yes, I do

2973
06:18:13,200 --> 06:18:17,759
Let's do this mission and then we'll see where we're at. It's been about six and a half hours so far

2974
06:18:19,599 --> 06:18:21,759
Let's see where we're at at the end of this mission here

2975
06:18:23,639 --> 06:18:26,200
Rename the horse to francis. No, I have to go get a new francis

2976
06:18:27,000 --> 06:18:35,680
You know what i'm saying? I'm not just I I can't just rename this guy. I have to tame a new horse name of francis

2977
06:18:36,400 --> 06:18:48,110
How many horses are you allowed to have at the moment? I can have four

2978
06:18:49,880 --> 06:18:52,490
Four total

2979
06:18:52,490 --> 06:19:15,549
That might increase later. I don't know random encounter. Well, I guess a snake bite

2980
06:19:32,439 --> 06:19:34,439
You good

2981
06:19:41,529 --> 06:19:43,529
Just tried that plan over there

2982
06:19:44,330 --> 06:19:46,330
He was like a gunshot

2983
06:19:49,369 --> 06:19:51,610
oh

2984
06:19:51,770 --> 06:19:53,869
From the one with the paint flowers

2985
06:19:54,909 --> 06:19:56,909
tiny little bastard

2986
06:19:57,310 --> 06:19:58,669
steer clear

2987
06:19:58,669 --> 06:20:00,669
Thanks, mister

2988
06:20:00,830 --> 06:20:07,290
I owe you my life some things you learn the hard way. Yeah

2989
06:20:08,090 --> 06:20:09,369
You can

2990
06:20:09,369 --> 06:20:11,369
You can say that again

2991
06:20:11,689 --> 06:20:21,880
Only the sage is a poisonous herb use it in the crafting to apply poison to weapons like throwing knives and arrows

2992
06:20:32,409 --> 06:20:59,360
Menus

2993
06:21:00,319 --> 06:21:03,459
Vomit ability unlocked well, I can craft poison

2994
06:21:16,509 --> 06:21:18,509
Ah too bad

2995
06:21:18,830 --> 06:21:20,830
I was thinking I was gonna puke off the horse

2996
06:21:21,310 --> 06:21:33,340
I'm not gonna feed it to the horse. What are you talking about?

2997
06:21:33,979 --> 06:21:36,919
gonna be evil

2998
06:21:36,919 --> 06:21:38,759
Why the poison?

2999
06:21:38,759 --> 06:21:40,680
I don't need poison for anything right now

3000
06:21:50,090 --> 06:22:02,569
Feed it to somebody else's horse. I don't think i'm going to do that

3001
06:22:04,349 --> 06:22:06,830
Well, I don't know why you guys want me to poison somebody's horse

3002
06:22:14,080 --> 06:22:17,680
Killed 50 people and put them on a train and you're worried about being evil

3003
06:22:19,580 --> 06:22:22,220
That I didn't do that the fucking monsters in my head did

3004
06:22:23,479 --> 06:22:25,720
The demon possessing me made me do that. I didn't do that

3005
06:22:26,680 --> 06:22:31,290
Although there is let's see what this is

3006
06:22:40,299 --> 06:22:42,299
The demon possessing me made me do it

3007
06:22:44,459 --> 06:22:52,959
What what are you talking? What i'm in like a cut scene with this guy why?

3008
06:23:00,270 --> 06:23:02,090
uh

3009
06:23:02,090 --> 06:23:04,169
They won't leave him alone. I can't stop this

3010
06:23:12,040 --> 06:23:14,040
I'm not holding down l2

3011
06:23:15,470 --> 06:23:17,470
It's trying to go into a cut scene with him

3012
06:23:32,700 --> 06:23:34,700
That train sound is like

3013
06:23:35,020 --> 06:23:36,540
Kind of freaking me out

3014
06:23:36,540 --> 06:23:41,639
It's back

3015
06:23:41,639 --> 06:23:43,159
It's back

3016
06:23:43,159 --> 06:23:48,090
What if I get it? Can I get it on the horse?

3017
06:23:52,220 --> 06:24:02,139
I can't escape this guy

3018
06:24:08,599 --> 06:24:10,680
Yeah, i'm permanently locked onto this guy

3019
06:24:11,919 --> 06:24:14,169
from any angle

3020
06:24:14,169 --> 06:24:16,970
I have to kill him. No. No, I need to see how this plays out

3021
06:24:17,770 --> 06:24:19,209
I can't kill him

3022
06:24:19,209 --> 06:24:32,349
I want him to get on a horse

3023
06:24:32,349 --> 06:24:39,259
I can't get on the horse

3024
06:24:41,040 --> 06:24:42,799
Like and here's the train

3025
06:24:42,799 --> 06:24:46,889
The train calls to me. It's calling me

3026
06:24:51,439 --> 06:25:23,099
I gotta find a cliff to jump off. I gotta somehow find a cliff to jump off of

3027
06:25:32,750 --> 06:25:34,830
Get me to i'm gonna go on the top of a mountain

3028
06:25:35,229 --> 06:25:37,630
Oh, wait, no, i'm still am i'm i'm locked

3029
06:25:38,590 --> 06:25:51,069
No, the jump canceled it. No, I think I got just too far away

3030
06:25:51,709 --> 06:25:54,520
He he probably despawned

3031
06:25:54,520 --> 06:25:57,080
He probably de-spawned unfortunately for us

3032
06:25:57,959 --> 06:26:03,549
Come on, here we go

3033
06:26:03,549 --> 06:26:26,299
The train commands it. No, I can't never mind. All right onto this we'll do this last mission

3034
06:26:26,700 --> 06:26:28,700
And then we'll call it night because it is getting late

3035
06:26:35,740 --> 06:26:38,779
I just want a backhanded hammer fist to punch somebody in the face

3036
06:26:43,950 --> 06:26:46,189
Just like burn

3037
06:26:46,349 --> 06:27:00,250
You think all this lemon air is free

3038
06:27:02,090 --> 06:27:06,009
Oh, that's a you're done that was a that was a guy that was

3039
06:27:21,639 --> 06:27:37,869
Horse, hey

3040
06:27:37,869 --> 06:27:43,040
Did I tell you guys that I can't whistle when I was younger?

3041
06:27:44,159 --> 06:27:46,159
uh my parents we had a dog and

3042
06:27:47,279 --> 06:27:50,669
You know my parents house

No

3047
06:28:08,060 --> 06:28:10,810
I think it was somebody else's dog

3048
06:28:10,889 --> 06:28:12,599
uh, but

3049
06:28:12,599 --> 06:28:14,599
so I don't know how to whistle like

3050
06:28:19,479 --> 06:28:30,159
I could do it for like a tenth of a second like so I used when you called your dog, you know, like oh like

3051
06:28:31,040 --> 06:28:32,319
Come here

3052
06:28:32,319 --> 06:28:34,319

3054
06:28:57,849 --> 06:29:08,349

3055
06:29:08,349 --> 06:29:10,970

3056
06:29:10,970 --> 06:29:13,599

3057
06:29:13,680 --> 06:29:21,790
I seriously used to say who who to call my dog. I just don't know how to whistle

3058
06:29:38,779 --> 06:29:46,540

06:31:05,689 --> 06:31:09,130
It's arthur. I thought it was a welcome back arthur. That was a random encounter

3068
06:31:09,930 --> 06:31:16,720

Do a funny homer bart simpson voice

I don't have I don't I don't know how to do that. All right, what's my cut? I got diamonds here, man

3078
06:32:29,630 --> 06:32:33,720
Where's the diamonds?

3079
06:32:33,720 --> 06:32:42,159
Did I sell them already?

3080
06:32:42,159 --> 06:32:47,880
There's nothing I didn't buy

3081
06:32:47,880 --> 06:33:01,580
Let's eat some food. What do you say?

3082
06:33:12,619 --> 06:33:14,380
cooked flaky fish

3083
06:33:14,380 --> 06:33:21,900
Do a spee voice the spee i'm not doing the spee voice guys

3084
06:33:22,860 --> 06:33:24,299
i'm sorry

3085
06:33:24,299 --> 06:33:28,250
This is the final mission of the night

3086
06:33:28,330 --> 06:33:30,409
and then

3087
06:33:30,409 --> 06:33:33,770
You may you got a lot on you may see me tomorrow as well

3088
06:33:35,880 --> 06:33:37,880
But there's a couple things I need to do

3089
06:33:37,880 --> 06:33:39,880
I might just I might take a break from red dead

3090
06:33:40,759 --> 06:33:42,759
We'll try something else tonight

3091
06:33:49,020 --> 06:33:51,979
Oh, we might lead into this or we'll see I don't know colored foe

3092
06:33:52,380 --> 06:33:57,500
They said there's a gang of fools holed up in the swamps east. I might just play this again. I don't know never ended

3093
06:33:58,139 --> 06:34:02,700
I might not stream tomorrow. I don't know raising in these fools minds 30 years later

3094
06:34:03,580 --> 06:34:04,939
That ain't my point

3095
06:34:04,939 --> 06:34:07,500
These ignorant fools are weapon dealers

3096
06:34:08,139 --> 06:34:12,060
And in their dealings sometimes sit on a decent pile of cash. Oh, no, no

3097
06:34:12,139 --> 06:34:15,419
I've been selling weapons to cuba and south america for years

3098
06:34:15,740 --> 06:34:21,580
I'm I'm absolutely not the old boy. I was talking to reckon there might be a bunch of cash just sitting around

3099
06:34:22,060 --> 06:34:23,659
and failing that

3100
06:34:23,659 --> 06:34:28,619
Maybe a nice stash of weapons with just a bunch of crazies gardening. Exactly. Well

3101
06:34:31,240 --> 06:34:36,759
Worth taking a look at least isn't it? That was my thinking said it was at some place called shady bear

3102
06:34:37,000 --> 06:34:39,000
Why does everybody want me to do this? Okay

3103
06:34:40,840 --> 06:34:42,119
I just go

3104
06:34:42,119 --> 06:34:48,680
Shmeek like that's it. That's that was like the comedy routine like four years ago. I was hoping you'd be in

3105
06:34:49,159 --> 06:34:51,159
If that's how they told it

3106
06:34:58,299 --> 06:35:32,959
He did it he did it this way all right, let's take off remember that one

3107
06:35:35,520 --> 06:35:37,520
Remember I did that four years ago

3108
06:35:40,669 --> 06:35:48,650
Well, that's not how I'm I think some of them harangued me and saty when we were coming back with supplies

3109
06:35:49,369 --> 06:35:51,369
Mrs. Apple star wars team

3110
06:36:11,689 --> 06:36:16,009
It seems like it is these boys got a manner about

3111
06:36:16,729 --> 06:36:22,330
But I haven't necessarily noticed all respect mr. Morgan you wouldn't notice

3112
06:36:23,290 --> 06:36:26,650
Might call you a nigger lover. They see us riding like this

3113
06:36:27,610 --> 06:36:31,529
But most of it is uh, my dog is a glance or a word

3114
06:36:32,330 --> 06:36:35,049
And after that you can't whistle but you can do that. No, I can't

3115
06:36:36,330 --> 06:36:39,290
Out west is out. I cannot is out west

3116
06:36:40,090 --> 06:36:42,090
And you're all who you are

3117
06:36:42,959 --> 06:36:44,560
decent folks

3118
06:36:44,720 --> 06:36:48,189
Some places down here they judge different

3119
06:36:50,540 --> 06:36:52,860
Yes, it can't be so easy for you Lenny

3120
06:36:54,189 --> 06:36:56,189
Sorry, you're caught up in this

3121
06:36:56,270 --> 06:37:02,349
Well, we demand more. I guess their gold still shines. Oh, there's no more and their guns still shooting

3122
06:37:02,750 --> 06:37:08,270
I just played a sound clip by I queued it up and I played it and every one of these bastards for all they got

3123
06:37:08,590 --> 06:37:11,200
Okay

3124
06:37:11,200 --> 06:37:15,680
Plus it beats being lynched back in black water with all of you by my side

3125
06:37:16,400 --> 06:37:18,400
I guess it does

3126
06:37:19,680 --> 06:37:21,680
More voices needed

3127
06:37:32,909 --> 06:37:38,029
Feels like we're close. It's a rundown old plantation house down in the bayou somewhere

3128
06:37:38,830 --> 06:37:41,069
Let's take it slow because

3129
06:37:42,270 --> 06:37:45,069
If like you say makes up for no whistle sitting on weapons

3130
06:37:47,069 --> 06:37:52,830
It's called sitting here just playing a video game of course and just doing that

3131
06:37:53,790 --> 06:37:58,830
They say it fine back before streaming and youtube and everything guys I used to sit here and do the same shit I do now

3132
06:37:59,630 --> 06:38:01,630
I can see the recto

3133
06:38:07,869 --> 06:38:11,310
See that church up ahead they're supposed to use it as an outpost

3134
06:38:11,950 --> 06:38:14,110
Just I was considering like making noises

3135
06:38:15,310 --> 06:38:24,270
Okay

3136
06:38:25,439 --> 06:38:27,439
I was always watching

3137
06:38:28,680 --> 06:38:32,189
Imagine getting caught up in a fight like yeah

3138
06:38:32,669 --> 06:38:34,590
I was already here

3139
06:38:34,590 --> 06:38:37,869
Well old content. I've already seen this. I already took the stuff from here

3140
06:38:41,849 --> 06:38:46,409
Hitman 2 comes out in three days. Look around there's so much out coming out

3141
06:38:48,459 --> 06:38:51,819
It doesn't look like anyone's here. We don't know that for sure

3142
06:38:53,099 --> 06:38:55,099
Let's have us a nosy

3143
06:38:57,279 --> 06:38:58,560
Hear that

3144
06:38:58,560 --> 06:39:03,790
Someone's on the track. I was already here. I came here too early

3145
06:39:11,560 --> 06:39:14,119
Look there a wagon. Let's see where

3146
06:39:16,990 --> 06:39:18,349
He's gone

3147
06:39:18,349 --> 06:39:20,349
You're on me now right behind

3148
06:39:21,389 --> 06:39:24,590
No, don't do it. It's the last mission

3149
06:39:27,819 --> 06:39:29,819
Hey ellen war

3150
06:39:30,860 --> 06:39:36,759
He could turn off at any time should we move up on him? Yeah

3151
06:39:42,779 --> 06:39:44,220
Did I lose?

3152
06:39:44,220 --> 06:39:48,759
I think I lost

3153
06:39:49,560 --> 06:39:52,319
Between the tree

3154
06:39:52,319 --> 06:39:55,389
I know this place

3155
06:39:55,389 --> 06:39:57,549
Okay, springfield rifle without the scope on it

3156
06:39:57,549 --> 06:40:06,299
You're real tough. Hey, it's getting late big plantation house must be shady bear

3157
06:40:07,180 --> 06:40:09,500
It is getting late up there off the trail

3158
06:40:10,459 --> 06:40:16,459
Once it gets to be above midnight 12 12 30 eastern time. It's time to call it a night. Come on

3159
06:40:17,259 --> 06:40:21,689
We can get a view on them from that wall up there. Make sure you bring the sharp shooter

3160
06:40:22,409 --> 06:40:24,409
I got it

3161
06:40:27,549 --> 06:40:30,810
I can't see

3162
06:40:30,810 --> 06:40:32,650
Oh now I can't

3163
06:40:32,650 --> 06:40:34,569
Maybe I should have the other rifle then

3164
06:40:34,569 --> 06:40:41,020
No, this thing's fine. Do you see anything? Yes

3165
06:40:42,400 --> 06:40:45,020
Yes

3166
06:40:47,580 --> 06:40:50,540
Is my internal clock adjusted almost a militia

3167
06:40:51,770 --> 06:40:53,770
Uh, it is at this point. Yeah

3168
06:40:54,009 --> 06:40:56,509
It's been pretty good. You got men covering the house

3169
06:41:03,119 --> 06:41:07,680
Gatling gun up there too. Well, they got that house locked down real tight

3170
06:41:08,240 --> 06:41:12,349
You got men everywhere off near the porch

3171
06:41:13,759 --> 06:41:28,810
Hey, you might want to look over to the right. I haven't seen anything worth shooting the stealer

3172
06:41:30,520 --> 06:41:34,439
I know. I know. I just wanted to see if I could see him. All right some tans

3173
06:41:53,869 --> 06:42:01,770
Or you could go down there acting friendly with these folks just draw them into one spot

3174
06:42:02,569 --> 06:42:09,630
I'll start shooting might be the dumbest idea i've ever heard but hey i'm always up for a performance

3175
06:42:10,590 --> 06:42:12,590
Well the tuba desk are done

3176
06:42:16,250 --> 06:42:21,819
Who's shooting?

3177
06:42:21,819 --> 06:42:23,659
What the fuck is going on?

3178
06:42:23,659 --> 06:42:30,060
Okay, lenny, uh

3179
06:42:31,069 --> 06:42:33,069
The dynamite's more fun

3180
06:42:38,119 --> 06:43:26,799
Lenny don't blow up got him. Hold on. Don't do anything yet. He's gonna get charged again

3181
06:43:28,000 --> 06:43:38,810
It's so hard to aim this stick

3182
06:43:51,150 --> 06:43:52,590
Holy shit

3183
06:43:52,590 --> 06:44:19,020
All right, get me out of the scope

3184
06:44:20,700 --> 06:44:25,819
Take the scope off

3185
06:44:26,619 --> 06:44:44,479
Give me my keyboard and give me my mouse back

3186
06:44:45,439 --> 06:45:31,439
Oh fuck that didn't hit him. What else we got?

3187
06:45:33,279 --> 06:45:43,000
Front door open up

3188
06:45:43,319 --> 06:46:04,060
That was crazy

3189
06:46:04,139 --> 06:46:09,979
They might be on the way now. Let's grab something to get out grab something search the area for weapons

3190
06:46:11,880 --> 06:46:16,889
There might be guns in these wag. Oh, what about the gatling gun?

3191
06:46:19,419 --> 06:46:21,340
This could be promised

3192
06:46:21,340 --> 06:46:24,909
What do you got here come on

3193
06:46:28,939 --> 06:46:34,939
We can sail those right we sure can we'll check the rest later now come on let's go

3194
06:46:36,889 --> 06:46:41,369
This uh, can we remove the dynamite off this thing? I don't think I want the dynamite

3195
06:46:45,310 --> 06:46:47,869
Is this a scenario where any little bump will cause a problem?

3196
06:46:48,590 --> 06:46:57,599
I'm doing it. I'm trying to go as fast as I can

3197
06:47:02,509 --> 06:47:04,509
Shoot the dynamite the turbo boost

3198
06:47:05,610 --> 06:47:07,610
Something tells me that's not gonna work

3199
06:47:12,029 --> 06:47:14,669
What's a black feller doing coming out of shady bell

3200
06:47:15,389 --> 06:47:19,229
In one hour wagon, you see

3201
06:47:20,830 --> 06:47:24,750
We already dropped a bunch of your people to get this wagon

3202
06:47:25,389 --> 06:47:27,950
You're gonna make us drop the three of you as well

3203
06:47:29,630 --> 06:47:36,840
The heart the brain

3204
06:47:38,970 --> 06:47:40,970
And ahead

3205
06:47:42,810 --> 06:48:04,720
I can't see anyone chasing us. How do you get I are three

3206
06:48:12,009 --> 06:48:14,779
We did it let's move

3207
06:48:19,279 --> 06:48:21,279
The heart the brain

3208
06:48:38,360 --> 06:48:41,720
We'll see what we do I might take a little break tomorrow

3209
06:48:44,009 --> 06:48:46,729
Depends who know I could just wake up and want to do it again

3210
06:48:48,729 --> 06:48:50,729
But ever since we've gotten internet back

3211
06:48:51,470 --> 06:48:54,029
Well, let's rephrase that ever since the internet has been gone

3212
06:48:54,750 --> 06:48:58,909
It's really the only thing we've been focusing on every day since two weeks ago. Okay

3213
06:48:59,470 --> 06:49:01,470
There's still a lot of other random shit that needs to get done

3214
06:49:03,520 --> 06:49:08,319
So I might take tomorrow to do some of that and when I get done with it might be i'll turn the stream on

3215
06:49:09,119 --> 06:49:16,509
I'm, just glad i've been able to stream for three straight days four straight days in a row without any major problems. So that's

3216
06:49:17,470 --> 06:49:19,470
That's good. Good news. I think

3217
06:49:19,790 --> 06:49:26,250
When's the green screen plan the green screen is planned?

3218
06:49:27,450 --> 06:49:29,450
For at some point over this weekend

3219
06:49:29,529 --> 06:49:31,529
And if not this weekend, then either

3220
06:49:32,009 --> 06:49:34,009
I would assume monday or tuesday of next week

3221
06:49:34,330 --> 06:49:37,709
the terms, uh

3222
06:49:37,709 --> 06:49:39,709
Just based on studio time

3223
06:49:42,889 --> 06:49:45,209
I'll have a clear answer for you in the next probably day or two

3224
06:49:57,689 --> 06:49:59,689
I still have my la noir save

3225
06:50:04,669 --> 06:50:06,669
I don't think I do

3226
06:50:07,709 --> 06:50:09,709
You can

3227
06:50:10,669 --> 06:50:12,669
Hey you too

3228
06:50:18,040 --> 06:50:26,459
Are they cloud safe bolt action rifle is now available to modify it because you now own it

3229
06:50:28,669 --> 06:50:29,950
All right. Cool

3230
06:50:29,950 --> 06:50:32,319
So let me just

3231
06:50:32,319 --> 06:50:36,439
I think it's pretty good time to stop

3232
06:50:36,439 --> 06:50:38,439
And that is where we're going to stop

3233
06:50:40,250 --> 06:50:49,740
Right here. But yeah, I don't I get to check on the la noir thing. See if I can pick up where I left off

3234
06:50:51,919 --> 06:50:53,279
oh

3235
06:50:53,279 --> 06:50:55,849
boy

3236
06:50:55,930 --> 06:50:59,770
So, uh la not la no more red dead red and if I stream tomorrow

3237
06:51:00,490 --> 06:51:07,049
It probably won't be red dead. I might change my mind, but we'll probably pivot to something else

3238
06:51:09,360 --> 06:51:11,520
Tomorrow is wednesday, right?

3239
06:51:12,950 --> 06:51:14,950
technically, well, yeah

3240
06:51:14,970 --> 06:51:17,610
well for it's 9 30 right now pacific, but

3241
06:51:18,720 --> 06:51:20,720
So tomorrow's technically wednesday. So

3242
06:51:21,119 --> 06:51:24,959
I might give myself a day to get to get the green screen situated for the weekend

3243
06:51:26,200 --> 06:51:28,200
And then come back on thursday

3244
06:51:29,159 --> 06:51:31,080
Or wednesday night

3245
06:51:31,080 --> 06:51:33,400
We'll see like I said, I don't really have a schedule right now

3246
06:51:34,860 --> 06:51:37,659
So i'm trying to figure that out as we speak

3247
06:51:39,159 --> 06:51:41,159
But thanks everybody for sticking around

3248
06:51:41,400 --> 06:51:43,400

Uh highly recommend so let's go ahead and do the bits while they're here, you know

3251
06:51:55,290 --> 06:52:00,599
Let's go back a while here back to here

3252
06:52:03,319 --> 06:52:04,520

Hey germa has

3256
06:52:12,479 --> 06:52:16,560
It's been a hot while since I caught your live stream due to job searching and european trips

3257
06:52:17,200 --> 06:52:22,319
That said I always enjoy the videos that get posted on your second channel and i'm so happy to see wall dad finally posted

Special thanks to holy mac then can't wait to see more of the funny man

3259
06:52:27,200 --> 06:52:31,840
Also side question. Have you voted yet or can you not do that now that you are in nevada?

3260
06:52:33,290 --> 06:52:34,590
well

3261
06:52:34,590 --> 06:52:37,549
Uh for the purposes of uh political stuff

3262
06:52:38,110 --> 06:52:41,790
We don't talk about politics on this stream. That's a very very important rule

3263
06:52:44,750 --> 06:52:46,750
And unless we're uh, unless we're

3264
06:52:47,549 --> 06:52:49,389
We make a joke

3265
06:52:49,389 --> 06:52:52,650
He can't do it because he's a convict

3266
06:52:57,500 --> 06:53:01,500
Yeah, you know, I mean I did got you like arrested nine times so

3267
06:53:03,529 --> 06:53:06,250

3268
06:53:13,470 --> 06:53:16,159
so

3269
06:53:16,159 --> 06:53:18,919
To answer the first part here

3270
06:53:18,919 --> 06:53:23,240
I am very glad to see wall dad as well because that was that's one of my favorite games of the year

3271
06:53:27,610 --> 06:53:45,369
Little boys can't vote. Oh my god. It's francis in jail, too

3272
06:53:49,419 --> 06:53:51,979

No, but thank you, dude

3274
06:53:56,919 --> 06:54:00,040
Thank you bro. Luck for the five dollars. I'm very poor and I don't have much money

3275
06:54:04,990 --> 06:54:09,389
German doesn't know politics enough that yes, I voted. Well, okay. No, I did not vote. There you go

3276
06:54:10,939 --> 06:54:12,939
And i'll tell you one reason why because the move

3277
06:54:13,580 --> 06:54:15,580
I didn't have like an opportunity

3278
06:54:16,139 --> 06:54:18,139
To go register in nevada

3279
06:54:19,150 --> 06:54:20,270
so

3280
06:54:20,270 --> 06:54:21,310
Sorry

3281
06:54:21,310 --> 06:54:27,229
There's been a lot going on. I just didn't have an opportunity to

3282
06:54:33,200 --> 06:54:35,200
I am registered to vote in

3283
06:54:36,619 --> 06:54:46,880
Massachusetts still so literally satan

3284
06:54:47,599 --> 06:54:52,000
I actually was going to do it. I think you could do it. There's like a way you could have done it or something. I just

3285
06:54:52,959 --> 06:54:54,959
There's been so much bullshit going on here

3286
06:54:56,189 --> 06:55:00,270
The whole internet thing moving in here. I just it was something that I just couldn't even think

3287
06:55:07,900 --> 06:55:10,189
but hopefully

3288
06:55:10,189 --> 06:55:12,669
All of you have a voice to your opinions

3289
06:55:13,470 --> 06:55:15,840
Because it is important at least if you know

3290
06:55:16,560 --> 06:55:18,560
talking about the american election stuff

3291
06:55:25,150 --> 06:55:28,110
and the candidates for nevada, too, that's another thing like I

3292
06:55:30,080 --> 06:55:33,680
Just need I haven't I don't like know the area. I don't know the people

3293
06:55:39,630 --> 06:55:41,630
I bet he voted for dean dingus

3294
06:55:44,479 --> 06:55:46,479
I wrote in germa

3295
06:55:46,880 --> 06:55:54,330
Oh god

3296
06:55:54,330 --> 06:55:56,330
but I I am planning on

3297
06:55:56,889 --> 06:56:00,159
being uh

3298
06:56:00,220 --> 06:56:02,029
Registered

3299
06:56:02,029 --> 06:56:04,029
But there's other reasons why?

3300
06:56:08,840 --> 06:56:14,380
For do not get political, uh, because I don't like to talk about it on the stream. Like I said

3301
06:56:15,630 --> 06:56:16,750
um

3302
06:56:16,750 --> 06:56:21,720
I don't know. I can't really talk about it as to why like i'm

3303
06:56:22,970 --> 06:56:24,729
I haven't like voted

3304
06:56:24,729 --> 06:56:40,009
It's understandable the tough thing with politics is

3305
06:56:43,689 --> 06:56:45,689
No, no, no, no, no, wait, whatever

3306
06:56:52,330 --> 06:56:55,450
It would be impossible to explain some of these things without

3307
06:56:56,090 --> 06:57:02,330
Somehow making somebody angry and that's kind of sad. I think in the current political spectrum

3308
06:57:06,029 --> 06:57:08,029
He wants to talk about it so bad

3309
06:57:17,630 --> 06:57:28,040
No

3310
06:57:28,040 --> 06:57:30,360
He didn't vote because he's not actually american

3311
06:57:31,000 --> 06:57:37,790
No, we'll just move on

3312
06:57:37,790 --> 06:57:42,669
That is actually something that i'm gonna try to get done here though is to like register in nevada

3313
06:57:45,369 --> 06:57:53,119
But we'll move on

3314
06:57:53,119 --> 06:57:55,360
Anywho

3315
06:57:55,360 --> 06:57:57,419
Thank you to

3316
06:57:57,419 --> 06:58:00,360
um

3317
06:58:00,360 --> 06:58:02,759
Div usp. Thanks for the three bucks. No message. Thank you

3318
06:58:10,720 --> 06:58:14,159
Just the last couple of nights div usp has just given money. Thank you

3319
06:58:16,909 --> 06:58:22,189
A burger. Thank you burger b for the five dollars here burger b. Thank you turbo heart to you

3320
06:58:25,790 --> 06:58:30,830
Dungeness. Thank you dungeness for the one dollar. Hey germa a couple of people in discord and I worked on this for a few days straight

3321
06:58:31,310 --> 06:58:33,229
And I was hoping you could play it on stream

3322
06:58:33,229 --> 06:58:36,509
A few sleepless nights were had to try to get this out before you started streaming again

3323
06:58:36,590 --> 06:58:38,590
Your move is very close to home

3324
06:58:38,750 --> 06:58:40,270
for me because

3325
06:58:40,270 --> 06:58:42,909
I'm going to be moving to from oregon to new zealand

3326
06:58:43,549 --> 06:58:47,950
For a university in a couple months and i'll be there for the next eight years at least damn

3327
06:58:48,909 --> 06:58:58,360
That's a long time

3328
06:58:58,360 --> 06:58:59,479
uh

3329
06:58:59,479 --> 06:59:01,709
Yeah, well, we'll watch it

3330
06:59:01,709 --> 06:59:07,529
We'll watch let's watch it at the end but good luck with the move. That's a that's a long ways, man

3331
06:59:08,250 --> 06:59:15,770
It's very far away

3332
06:59:15,770 --> 06:59:20,650
Hopefully that is very smoothly go smoothly for you. Okay, except just going from

3333
06:59:21,509 --> 06:59:23,509
massachusetts to nevada was

3334
06:59:24,200 --> 06:59:31,479
Fucking painful so I can imagine going from oregon to new zealand will be tough. So good luck to you

3335
06:59:32,200 --> 06:59:36,680
And we'll play it at the end of the stream

3336
06:59:36,680 --> 06:59:40,599
Uh wild fox. Thanks for the one dollar. Thank you for what you said on my ten dollar bits the other night

3337
06:59:40,680 --> 06:59:43,159
I'm doing my best in your infectious laugh does wonders

3338
06:59:43,720 --> 06:59:46,119
How is life treating you in vegas now that you settled in a little bit?

3339
06:59:48,169 --> 06:59:49,209
um

3340
06:59:49,209 --> 06:59:52,330
Settling in nicely. I think the last three or four days

3341
06:59:52,970 --> 06:59:55,610
Especially the last probably four or five days

3342
06:59:56,650 --> 06:59:58,830
Has really let me breathe a little

3343
06:59:59,790 --> 07:00:01,790
Because it's been three weeks straight of

3344
07:00:02,590 --> 07:00:04,590
Just kind of bullshit on top of bullshit

3345
07:00:06,830 --> 07:00:08,830
That I haven't really had much time

3346
07:00:08,990 --> 07:00:10,669
To myself

3347
07:00:10,669 --> 07:00:12,669
And not time my time to myself. I mean

3348
07:00:14,430 --> 07:00:19,069
It's there's been something going on every day that needed 100 of my attention

3349
07:00:20,599 --> 07:00:22,569
and now

3350
07:00:22,569 --> 07:00:27,849
I can kind of just chill now as as of probably today or yesterday

3351
07:00:32,409 --> 07:00:34,409
so thankfully it's

3352
07:00:34,409 --> 07:00:36,169
Time to take a breather

3353
07:00:36,169 --> 07:00:38,729
Step back and actually enjoy and understand like where I am

3354
07:00:41,950 --> 07:00:47,470
So the the moving process went through all the internet you I wish I could even describe

3355
07:00:48,509 --> 07:00:50,990
Just how painful that internet process was

3356
07:00:52,430 --> 07:00:54,560
We would have to sit here

3357
07:00:54,560 --> 07:00:56,560
And wait for a technician to show up

3358
07:00:58,590 --> 07:01:00,590
Nine technicians have come over here

3359
07:01:01,610 --> 07:01:04,000
three supervisors

3360
07:01:04,000 --> 07:01:05,759
It's been every day

3361
07:01:05,759 --> 07:01:09,279
We've been doing it every single day. It's the only thing we've been thinking about and doing

3362
07:01:12,040 --> 07:01:14,360
And they they told us they finally figured it out. So

3363
07:01:15,400 --> 07:01:19,959
Uh, but then just trying to figure out when like the trash comes and

3364
07:01:20,599 --> 07:01:26,360
Where things are it's it's a throwing yourself into a brand new thing that you've never seen or done before

3365
07:01:27,799 --> 07:01:31,159
It's very i've never done it before it's actually never happened

3366
07:01:31,560 --> 07:01:36,720
This is the first time in my whole life that i've just kind of thrown myself into a completely different place

3367
07:01:38,189 --> 07:01:40,909
and something you don't realize when you do that is

3368
07:01:42,060 --> 07:01:44,060
Everything starts from scratch

3369
07:01:45,159 --> 07:01:50,330
Everything so I mean my whole life

3370
07:01:50,970 --> 07:01:55,869
literally everything everything i've ever done everything i've ever said everything i've ever been was massachusetts

3371
07:01:57,580 --> 07:02:02,459
And you start to realize all the little things that just don't follow you here

3372
07:02:04,470 --> 07:02:06,470
It's a brand new fresh start

3373
07:02:10,459 --> 07:02:12,459
and it's equally parts refreshing and

3374
07:02:13,580 --> 07:02:14,819
um

3375
07:02:14,819 --> 07:02:16,819
Kind of nerve-wracking too

3376
07:02:19,060 --> 07:02:21,060
I love it out here though. I think it's great

3377
07:02:25,849 --> 07:02:27,849
His debt can't get him now

3378
07:02:27,930 --> 07:02:34,099
It's okay germ I lived here in texas my entire life and I still don't know where the trash comes

3379
07:02:36,680 --> 07:02:38,330
uh

3380
07:02:38,330 --> 07:02:43,209
But it's been wild and i'm i'm finally happy just to be able to get kind of off the ride for a little while

3381
07:02:43,930 --> 07:02:46,250
And get back to what I was doing

3382
07:02:47,130 --> 07:02:49,020
which was this

3383
07:02:49,020 --> 07:02:50,900
and

3384
07:02:50,900 --> 07:02:52,900
Being able to at least even enjoy

3385
07:02:53,540 --> 07:02:55,139
Anything else besides?

3386
07:02:55,139 --> 07:03:00,659
Okay, so i'm gonna get a new insurance. I don't have health insurance right now. I've been having like weird medical problems

3387
07:03:00,740 --> 07:03:02,740
I need health insurance, but how long does that take?

3388
07:03:02,979 --> 07:03:07,220
I gotta get like a letter of termination from my other insurance. Okay. No, I don't have health insurance though

3389
07:03:07,220 --> 07:03:12,020
Okay, but what about like other? Okay. I gotta pay the rent. Okay. Hold on but uh

3390
07:03:12,900 --> 07:03:17,060
What's what day is it? I don't have a couch. We need to go get a soap. We don't have any furniture

3391
07:03:17,700 --> 07:03:20,340
I can only fit so much in my moving thing

3392
07:03:21,930 --> 07:03:23,930
It's been like that every fucking day

3393
07:03:28,939 --> 07:03:31,319
But we're good now

3394
07:03:31,319 --> 07:03:35,290
All everything's gravy

3395
07:03:35,290 --> 07:03:37,290
Thank you gaga pudding for the two bucks

3396
07:03:38,619 --> 07:03:41,180
I'm just popping in here to give you a couple bits. I'm glad you move went well

3397
07:03:41,180 --> 07:03:43,180
And I hope you didn't hit too many squirrels

3398
07:03:43,819 --> 07:03:47,419
Well, I was in an airplane. So that would have been really weird

3399
07:03:49,459 --> 07:03:54,020
Bullwinkle would have been really upset if if we had hit a squirrel in the ear. Let's just say that

3400
07:03:58,119 --> 07:04:01,319
Uh, thank you lazy luke for the three dollars. I already asked before you move

3401
07:04:01,319 --> 07:04:05,400
But can I make your ideas of something fun with the end of the stream subs?

3402
07:04:06,119 --> 07:04:10,439
I would try my best

3403
07:04:10,439 --> 07:04:12,439
Yeah, I think i'd like to get some input

3404
07:04:12,520 --> 07:04:16,919
From a lot of different people to see like what would be fun to do and what would be even possible to do

3405
07:04:22,650 --> 07:04:24,569
Whatever the possibilities are

3406
07:04:24,569 --> 07:04:29,560
I would love to see them

3407
07:04:29,560 --> 07:04:31,560
So, I mean i'll be around the discord

3408
07:04:32,459 --> 07:04:35,580
I'll probably be talking about i'll probably bring it up at some point in the discord

3409
07:04:36,459 --> 07:04:38,459
And maybe talk to some of the mods about

3410
07:04:38,779 --> 07:04:40,779
Maybe try to figure out something fun to do

3411
07:04:40,779 --> 07:04:44,259
suggestion wise

3412
07:04:44,259 --> 07:04:50,409
But thank you lazy luke

3413
07:04:50,409 --> 07:04:52,409
And yeah, I I will probably

3414
07:04:53,689 --> 07:04:57,369
I'll put up more a cleaner forum than just like general chat

3415
07:04:59,939 --> 07:05:02,580
Uh gaga pudding. Thank you again for two dollars. Hey, it's me again

3416
07:05:02,580 --> 07:05:06,020
I hope you didn't hit any flying squirrels either. They're a fierce bunch. Well, there you go

3417
07:05:06,979 --> 07:05:10,310
There's the flying squirrel

3418
07:05:10,389 --> 07:05:12,330
Flying squirrel bit

3419
07:05:12,330 --> 07:05:14,389
Thank you gaga

3420
07:05:14,389 --> 07:05:19,270
Uh macle grunt. Thanks for the one dollar kill him do it. I don't know who you're referring to. Hopefully I didn't

3421
07:05:19,830 --> 07:05:21,110
hopefully

3422
07:05:21,110 --> 07:05:28,090
waved at him

3423
07:05:28,090 --> 07:05:30,569
Gaga pudding again. Thanks for five dollars gaga pudding

3424
07:05:31,819 --> 07:05:36,700
Hey, jeremy never mind the squirrels this time. I remember when I first saw your shme videos and I thought they were hilarious

3425
07:05:37,180 --> 07:05:41,020
So I sold them showed them some of my friends in school and only got blank stares

3426
07:05:41,500 --> 07:05:43,580
That's when I realized that I had found something special

3427
07:05:45,770 --> 07:05:48,139
Thanks, dude

3428
07:05:49,909 --> 07:05:53,990
Uh, i've already told you the story about how I showed that girl the auto video and then she like

3429
07:05:54,970 --> 07:05:57,130
Literally did not want to talk to me anymore

3430
07:05:58,939 --> 07:06:00,380
Sounds about right

3431
07:06:01,020 --> 07:06:03,020
Kxc, thank you for the five dollars kxc

3432
07:06:04,470 --> 07:06:06,709
Just put the old guy out of his misery. Oh dear

3433
07:06:08,950 --> 07:06:14,869
Garfield the monday killer. Thanks for the one dollar. I made this for you a while ago jerma. It's you and your trusty balloon buddy

3434
07:06:16,229 --> 07:06:18,340
Liam

3435
07:06:18,340 --> 07:06:21,459
Like helium, but his name is liam and i clever

3436
07:06:22,259 --> 07:06:25,580
Please don't ban me

3437
07:06:25,580 --> 07:06:29,979
Um, there's only one person that I knew in the balloons and I don't know what happened to him

3438
07:06:30,619 --> 07:06:39,299
That's a very that's a beautiful balloon

3439
07:06:39,380 --> 07:06:43,099
That's a beauty

3440
07:06:43,099 --> 07:06:45,500
Thank you garfield

3441
07:06:46,139 --> 07:06:48,090
I did not

3442
07:06:48,090 --> 07:06:50,889
Thank you dan boss for the one dollar. No message. Thank you

3443
07:06:52,380 --> 07:06:56,700
Cool cool g1. Thanks with three bucks. Hey jerma. Can you take your shoes off, please?

3444
07:06:56,700 --> 07:06:59,509
I don't have any shoes on right now, but thank you though

3445
07:07:00,069 --> 07:07:03,909
Thank you ifs for the one dollar. Hope you're doing. All right jerma

3446
07:07:03,909 --> 07:07:08,950
Just want you to know that these comeback streams really have been keeping me sane through this rut i've been in

3447
07:07:10,069 --> 07:07:12,069
Uh, you truly are a saint

3448
07:07:12,229 --> 07:07:14,869
I also just want to apologize for my drunkenness the other night

3449
07:07:15,430 --> 07:07:19,270
Also when you start watching jojo, I want a synopsis on each stream of what episode you watched

3450
07:07:20,439 --> 07:07:21,990

swat four

3477
07:09:10,439 --> 07:09:17,659
Now we haven't done that yet. Love you stream. My state of michigan just legalized weed. Can't wait for the green screen stream

3478
07:09:18,380 --> 07:09:21,369
Well, there you go

3479
07:09:21,369 --> 07:09:23,369
Uh, we haven't done swat four yet though

3480
07:09:24,069 --> 07:09:27,619
swat four

3481
07:09:27,619 --> 07:09:31,459
Star and I were gonna play swat four, but it's the all you can't play it online

3482
07:09:31,459 --> 07:09:33,459
You have to do like weird shit. We were trying to figure it up

3483
07:09:36,759 --> 07:09:38,919
But the state of michigan is legalized weed

3484
07:09:41,029 --> 07:09:45,080
Hell, yeah

3485
07:09:45,080 --> 07:09:47,240
Hey garfield of undead killer. Thanks for the one dollar

3486
07:09:48,229 --> 07:09:50,630
uh, you never guess who

3487
07:09:50,709 --> 07:09:54,790
Who I heard from francis the fox contacted me after you burnt yourself to death

3488
07:09:55,590 --> 07:10:01,110
He got you a postcard from the ghost ghost soul train. He told me to tell you i'm keeping the train full of souls for you

3489
07:10:01,669 --> 07:10:03,669
If you ever feel like coming back

3490
07:10:03,750 --> 07:10:05,750
Miss you, don't forget to write

3491
07:10:05,750 --> 07:10:08,060
You got any nice words for francis?

3492
07:10:16,580 --> 07:10:20,180
Getting political. No, is that that's I we don't talk about politics

3493
07:10:26,459 --> 07:10:29,259
Marijuana is legal in las vegas. It is completely

3494
07:10:31,799 --> 07:10:33,799
I don't smoke marijuana. I don't

3495
07:10:34,919 --> 07:10:36,919
But I know the medical

3496
07:10:37,799 --> 07:10:39,799
And recreational purposes for it

3497
07:10:40,279 --> 07:10:43,419
I mean i'm not gonna get political

3498
07:10:45,770 --> 07:10:50,009
That's like okay. But all right. First of all saying that you're in favor of marijuana use

3499
07:10:51,740 --> 07:10:55,180
Is as if that's barely even a political statement anymore

3500
07:10:59,880 --> 07:11:02,119
That's not that's like not even political anymore

3501
07:11:06,439 --> 07:11:12,330
It's just an opinion at this point

3502
07:11:12,330 --> 07:11:14,330
No politics. I know I

3503
07:11:17,299 --> 07:11:20,819
Sometimes I wish we could just talk politics like very very like just

3504
07:11:21,459 --> 07:11:24,500
Plainly insanely, but it's not it's not possible

3505
07:11:28,139 --> 07:11:32,880
Everybody's so different. Everybody has so many different views that it's just it's impossible

3506
07:11:36,900 --> 07:11:39,939
I don't know. I mean like not that I do but i'm just saying like something like

3507
07:11:40,819 --> 07:11:42,970
it's hard

3508
07:11:42,970 --> 07:11:44,169
because

3509
07:11:44,169 --> 07:11:49,290
I mean there are people that are here, right? Let's just say that there is you know, two three thousand people there and I say something

3510
07:11:49,930 --> 07:11:51,930
And I say something that I that I believe right?

3511
07:11:53,419 --> 07:11:56,299
It just it's it's always going to just cause a problem

3512
07:11:58,459 --> 07:12:03,740
Even if the thing that I think would be I believe in you know, I just it's just hard you can't

3513
07:12:04,459 --> 07:12:10,939
It's not impossible. People just need to be more willing to listen to others

3514
07:12:11,930 --> 07:12:15,369
Yeah

3515
07:12:15,369 --> 07:12:18,299
Yeah

3516
07:12:18,299 --> 07:12:19,979
Yes

3517
07:12:19,979 --> 07:12:21,740
Yeah, yes

3518
07:12:21,740 --> 07:12:29,610
Political parties. Yeah, I mean like yes, that's all I can say. Yes

3519
07:12:35,610 --> 07:12:39,130
We're willing to listen to your opinions as long as you don't support bubzy 3d

3520
07:12:40,340 --> 07:12:41,459
Yes

3521
07:12:41,459 --> 07:12:52,569
The only thing is people are very dynamic

3522
07:12:53,860 --> 07:12:57,830
and

3523
07:12:57,830 --> 07:13:01,540
Yes

3524
07:13:01,540 --> 07:13:03,540
That's it

3525
07:13:09,049 --> 07:13:11,049
How could you say something like that?

3526
07:13:12,169 --> 07:13:25,540
Yes, that's it

3527
07:13:25,540 --> 07:13:27,060
I agree with that

3528
07:13:27,060 --> 07:13:35,000
Who should I vote for? Yes

3529
07:13:35,080 --> 07:13:41,610
I honestly don't want to know germans political views. I've already had artists and entertainers

3530
07:13:41,610 --> 07:13:45,450
I admire tarnished in my eyes by knowing their views and I'd rather that not happen with me

3531
07:13:47,590 --> 07:13:50,549
Yeah, I don't I just don't want I don't want that either

3532
07:13:53,270 --> 07:13:55,349
I don't think any of the things that I believe are

3533
07:13:56,860 --> 07:13:58,860
That out of the ordinary or that

3534
07:13:59,340 --> 07:14:01,020
crazy or anything

3535
07:14:01,020 --> 07:14:04,150
I like to try to think as myself is

3536
07:14:04,709 --> 07:14:06,020
just

3537
07:14:06,020 --> 07:14:08,340
try to look at issues rationally and

3538
07:14:09,459 --> 07:14:12,259
I don't think there's anything I could ever really say that would be like, whoa

3539
07:14:12,740 --> 07:14:15,139
What the fuck did he just say?

3540
07:14:16,180 --> 07:14:18,020
I don't think so

3541
07:14:18,020 --> 07:14:26,330
That's what everyone thinks about their own beliefs. That's why they believe it. That's true. That's you know, that that's completely 100 true

3542
07:14:36,490 --> 07:14:39,450
Stop before you regret no, I would never i'm not i'm not gonna say

3543
07:14:40,090 --> 07:14:46,259
Very much at all. So don't worry

3544
07:14:46,259 --> 07:14:49,939
The only reason why it's even brought up in the first place is because like today was the day

3545
07:14:53,209 --> 07:14:55,930
So that's the only reason why it's even brought up in the first place

3546
07:15:09,689 --> 07:15:14,250
I can't believe how level-headed this guy is. I haven't even like made any opinions. I've said yes

3547
07:15:15,049 --> 07:15:16,650
and

3548
07:15:16,650 --> 07:15:24,580
That's all i've said

3549
07:15:24,740 --> 07:15:27,099
This guy said yes

3550
07:15:27,099 --> 07:15:28,459
but anywho

3551
07:15:28,459 --> 07:15:30,459
Um, it's just because today was the day

3552
07:15:31,180 --> 07:15:35,020
And some people have questions and opinions and and I get it like people want to know

3553
07:15:36,220 --> 07:15:40,939
Hey, I I did this. I I voted you voted and what what did you vote for and it's like

3554
07:15:42,599 --> 07:15:44,060
You know just

3555
07:15:44,060 --> 07:15:47,419
It is today was the day of all these um

3556
07:15:48,860 --> 07:15:50,860
changes in seats and stuff so

3557
07:15:51,500 --> 07:15:53,500
Makes sense as to why people

3558
07:15:53,580 --> 07:16:01,560
wanted to know

3559
07:16:01,959 --> 07:16:04,409
Thanks for the one dollar

3560
07:16:04,409 --> 07:16:09,209
Excited for you to get back to la noir, although I don't know if you're what your plan probably will be for the save

3561
07:16:09,689 --> 07:16:14,250
I don't know if you can download a save for the ps4 or download for the pc and download a save there

3562
07:16:15,049 --> 07:16:20,409
Because with a 100 save you can access all the cases or just play it on your own your choice

3563
07:16:22,009 --> 07:16:26,409
I'll have to see how that I didn't get that far in la noir. So I don't think it'll be that much of a problem

3564
07:16:32,360 --> 07:16:33,880
But thank you, dude

3565
07:16:33,880 --> 07:16:36,520
Thank you chubby funster for the one dollar. Thanks for streaming these three days in a row

3566
07:16:36,520 --> 07:16:40,680
It's been great that train bit was amazing really needed this after a scary morning

3567
07:16:41,400 --> 07:16:47,400
I was going into my room to make some business calls worth millions when I suddenly see and I shit you not the biggest spider

3568
07:16:47,400 --> 07:16:48,520
I've ever seen

3569
07:16:48,520 --> 07:16:53,880
I slowly left my from saying that spider is fucked the spider now owns my room when I sleep in the bath. Thanks, dude

3570
07:16:56,060 --> 07:16:58,299
I was waiting for one. I was waiting for one to show up

3571
07:17:03,619 --> 07:17:05,619
Thanks with millions

3572
07:17:06,439 --> 07:17:09,319
Shoot man. Thank you shoot man for the one dollar keep up the good work my dude

3573
07:17:09,319 --> 07:17:13,240
I'm currently finishing my undergrad at university and i'm thinking of doing a masters

3574
07:17:13,959 --> 07:17:19,720
Your streams always give good vibes and it makes studying fun. I had a dream comcast never turned off your internet

3575
07:17:20,279 --> 07:17:22,279
And you kept streaming for a month straight

3576
07:17:22,439 --> 07:17:27,159
You stayed in the house when new tenants moved in and living in the walls never stopping the stream

3577
07:17:27,319 --> 07:17:30,439
The tenants were trying to investigate random snorting noises like it was a ghost

3578
07:17:31,799 --> 07:17:33,799
I'm glad that's not real

3579
07:17:37,689 --> 07:17:39,909
Thank you shoot man

3580
07:17:39,909 --> 07:17:44,549
Uh, thank you hippo rider for the one dollar. Hey germa want to know your thoughts on fallout 76 and doom eternal

3581
07:17:45,349 --> 07:17:47,830
Also, love your content helped me through so many very tough times

3582
07:17:49,380 --> 07:17:51,380
I don't really I don't have any opinions on either of them

3583
07:17:51,860 --> 07:17:57,430
The only opinions the only things I know about fallout 76 are that like the game just like didn't work

3584
07:17:58,779 --> 07:18:04,220
I don't have any opinions on it. I just saw my twitter feed was exploding of like fallout 76 is broken and sucks

3585
07:18:04,220 --> 07:18:05,900
I can't play it

3586
07:18:05,900 --> 07:18:10,060
There's always problems. I don't I don't have any opinions because I didn't do it. So

3587
07:18:11,959 --> 07:18:13,880
Political fallout feels

3588
07:18:13,880 --> 07:18:17,659
But thank you

3589
07:18:17,659 --> 07:18:19,740
Uh, I don't sorry. I don't have an opinion for you

3590
07:18:23,740 --> 07:18:27,979
Thank you deus mortay for the one dollar. I meant to say police quest swat not swat four

3591
07:18:29,240 --> 07:18:31,560
Oh, right, right, right the fmv game. That's right

3592
07:18:34,169 --> 07:18:36,709
Thank you though deus

Right now

3596
07:18:42,549 --> 07:18:44,549
Oh me. Oh my oh

3597
07:18:44,790 --> 07:18:49,909
Floyd come and welcome our boy. The balloon is down the internet up put some dunkin in your cup

3598
07:18:50,709 --> 07:18:53,509
Welcome back. Welcome home. Remember to leave politics alone

3599
07:18:57,400 --> 07:18:59,400
Say an opinion any opinion

3600
07:19:01,130 --> 07:19:03,130
Reese's is the best fucking candy

3601
07:19:05,340 --> 07:19:07,340
And I eat full Hershey bars

3602
07:19:07,939 --> 07:19:09,860
I'm the weirdo

3603
07:19:09,860 --> 07:19:13,139
I'm the serial killer that eats just the regular default Hershey bar

3604
07:19:16,150 --> 07:19:18,150
I'm the one guy that you've heard of

3605
07:19:24,200 --> 07:19:31,189
Burn him. All right. What do you say? We get the credits going while I set the video up

3606
07:19:32,419 --> 07:19:35,299
Thank you to all of the new subs and old subs. You guys are amazing

3607
07:19:41,900 --> 07:19:43,900
Take care everybody all of you

3608
07:19:44,580 --> 07:19:46,580
Let me get this video set up

3609
07:19:47,849 --> 07:19:49,290
while we watch the

3610
07:19:49,290 --> 07:19:53,099
list of people

3611
07:19:53,099 --> 07:19:56,299
Twizzlers or red vines of both of them are disgusting

3612
07:19:57,939 --> 07:20:02,740
I think licorice is the biggest scam in the history of the world. I'd rather eat toothpaste flavored candy

3613
07:20:03,619 --> 07:20:10,310
Licorice is awful

3689
07:28:44,380 --> 07:28:48,060
Skin of an alternate spider-man. You didn't know who it was. So you called him spider-man jex

3690
07:28:48,700 --> 07:28:50,700
Then you laughed and I woke up

3691
07:28:54,700 --> 07:29:04,919
Well exoskeleton bug millennium boy is um, he's he's doing just fine. I have a question cheese nips or republican
