1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:08,439
So I'm setting up VR. Let me tell you something about VR. I don't know why you would ever

2
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:13,800
fucking buy this. I don't know why you'd ever own one of these. It's a thing. Yeah, I'm kidding.

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:21,190
Start it off with a rant. Let me tell you something about VR. Should every VR stream

4
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:34,149
start with me being mad at VR? No, I'm fine. I'm good. The mic is quiet. Well, it's because,

5
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:39,960
hold on. It shouldn't be now because it was loud yesterday or the day before.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:53,719
Hold on a second. Okay, I just don't want it to peak. Anyways, how you doing? Welcome to another

7
00:00:53,719 --> 00:01:02,729
two to three hour VR stream. I have a bunch of games. We're gonna roll through them. At least

8
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:10,650
30 to 40 minutes in each one. I have two back to back here that I want to start with. What's that

9
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:21,370
thing behind you? What? Oh, let me just let me just grab a water. And we'll start in like

10
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:32,840
one and a half to two minutes. Be right back in a minute. Oh, the first game. Let me tell you.

11
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:40,980
The first game we're going to play is the arcade, the peer, peer arcade,

12
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:49,140
peer arcade two. I don't even know if the games I even have loaded here. It's like a VR arcade

13
00:01:49,140 --> 00:04:01,050
simulator. It looked interesting. I'm gonna try it. I'll be right back. Okay. You guys ready?

14
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:21,980
That was five minutes. That was not five minutes. All right, let me get over here.

15
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:28,069
I did. I got a chair. So if I need to sit down, I can sit down if I have to.

16
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:49,850
All right, we get in here. Yes. All right. Can you can you guys hear it? All right,

17
00:04:49,850 --> 00:05:02,300
the little low for me. Oh, so this game's got skeeball. It's got billiards. It's got,

18
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:10,709
I don't know, we're about to find out. What was the other one? Let me get my hand here.

19
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:22,569
Make sure I can see all of your lovely faces, which I can. Please. I have no idea what you said.

20
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:33,500
All I saw is please. Okay, this actually has index controls, which is actually pretty cool.

21
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,579
All right, press up and aim to teleport. Let me get hold on. My eyes are not in the right place.

22
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:43,240
Hope everybody's having a good day. Hope you're taking care of yourselves.

23
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:51,399
All right, here we go. It's a teleport game. That makes sense. That's okay. Why did you do

24
00:05:51,399 --> 00:06:01,509
it? It's a VR game. Don't do that. This is virtual reality. You can't do that. Stop

25
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:12,060
jump scaring me. It's those need to come up very, very slowly. Wimp. But as if it's,

26
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:21,930
it's scary. All right, this is how you turn out a snap turn. Yeah. Okay. Sure. All right. All right,

27
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:28,069
I'm ready. Those got to come up if they're in the so this is my peripheral right here,

28
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:32,920
right? Can you do middle finger? Oh, you can. All right, cool. So this is my peripheral.

29
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:42,569
If this, this has to go like this fast. You can't in VR have to be like it's scared. It scares the

30
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:51,290
shit out of people. All right, how to grab and throw squeeze grip to grab and release to throw

31
00:06:51,290 --> 00:07:01,779
squeeze. Okay. That's pretty fluid. That was fluid. I'll be honest. That was very fluid over here.

32
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:15,180
Can I do it with the other ones? Insert coins. Wait, what the hell is this? That's how you put

33
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:31,129
a coin in? Why is this? Why is there like a bomb in here? Oh shit. Really? How's the how's the how's

34
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:40,939
the audio? We good? How's the audio? I can't see so I need to know. It's good. It's good. It's all

35
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:48,149
right. It's good. It's good. Sounds good. Freddy Fazbear. All right. What about capitalism? I don't

36
00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:56,500
know. I don't I don't want ambient sounds in my head. Should I smooth turn for you to help you

37
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:15,910
guys or is this all right? All right, single player. Is there story? Okay. It looks kind of

38
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:25,370
weird. Does it look weird for you? It looks kind of weird for me. What's this? How much money do I

39
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:32,789
have? Oh, shit. Are you kidding me? This is awesome. This is like coin game, but I get to actually do

40
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:48,549
it in real life. Well, in fake life. All right, let's try it. What do I do? Oh, what is this song?

41
00:08:52,440 --> 00:09:13,080
Am I doing it right? I got it. I got one. Turn it. Turn turn. Okay, now come up. What? All right,

42
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:23,779
bring it down. Got one. This is too hard. This is way too hard. I'm just gonna leave this. I don't

43
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:27,220
care. I'm just leaving it. Some five year old will come and get a free life. I don't care.

44
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,639
Some some like 10 year old could go over there and get a free life.

45
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:40,870
Oh, I know this one. What do I do? I was gonna just fucking just load the goddamn thing up with

46
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:55,899
coins. You know what I mean? 26 credits. I'm gonna be here for a little while. Do I have money?

47
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:02,549
Where's my money? Do I have like a money indicator? He's a rich kid.

48
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:22,500
Instructions. Press the button to swing the crane arm. Okay, I didn't get any. All right,

49
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:34,169
there's like this like $30 in here. Right? Wait, am I trying to get it down here or over there?

50
00:10:34,809 --> 00:11:02,809
Down here, right? No. There we go. That's five. I'll take it. Oh, there's coins. This like has

51
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:08,950
zero value to me right now. Do you know what I mean? If I know if I have 50 attempts and like

52
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:15,259
put like $100 in here or like $30 in here, there's no risk. There's no reward. Like I don't care.

53
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:32,620
There's no there's no stakes. I can just do this as many times as I want. Go harder. All right,

54
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:44,330
one more. I'm gonna get this hand over here. All right, some 10 year olds gonna be real happy

55
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:56,679
when they come over here. Like you're welcome. There's like $30 in there. Oh, I love this one.

56
00:11:56,679 --> 00:12:08,279

not a magic user i have a bow and arrow i'm a bow and arrow user but i think the game really

03:23:18,569 --> 03:23:27,290
right that was a kind of a fucked up messed up thing to have it just did they still do that

688
03:23:28,569 --> 03:23:37,770
i remember they had the ropes come down and you climbed the rope all the way to the ceiling and

689
03:23:37,770 --> 03:23:40,809
it was just like oh yeah that's just what you do you just climb to the you just climb to the top

690
03:23:40,809 --> 03:23:51,100
of the ceiling without any like help they still do that isn't that dangerous i don't remember any

691
03:23:51,100 --> 03:24:03,379
safety harnesses it's just like holding on for dear life being like what it's fine that's a boomer

693
03:24:13,350 --> 03:24:25,430
way up to the top i remember that yeah i would loathe seeing those ropes hanging from the ceiling

694
03:24:25,430 --> 03:24:33,270
and you'd i don't know you'd always kind of go up like a quarter of the way and just pretend

695
03:24:33,270 --> 03:24:44,889
like you just like can't do it i'm too weak i'm way too i'm too weak like okay fine i really

702
03:30:53,350 --> 03:31:01,659
that we're gonna play today a game called vr workshop making some things out of wood

703
03:31:02,299 --> 03:31:18,219
woodworking game kind of cool how's the tea it was good that's some water

704
03:31:23,799 --> 03:31:27,559
at 330 yep this is we're definitely getting to that point where i'm uh

705
03:31:29,059 --> 03:31:39,139
flowing down this game is gonna be way too hard for you what choose the board that yeah this is

706
03:31:39,139 --> 03:31:47,459
gonna be easy i'm gonna have a good time all right let's do some woodworking this will be

707
03:31:47,459 --> 03:31:53,209
where we end it today and then the next stream uh i don't know how long the blair witch vr game is

708
03:31:53,209 --> 03:31:59,350
but i'm gonna start with that and that will probably what's today because i have to have

709
03:31:59,350 --> 03:32:07,450
enough time to make sure the big stream on the first is good to go so i'll probably what's

710
03:32:07,450 --> 03:32:22,200
today the 23rd 24th 23 i will probably stream next on the 27th because then that'll give me

711
03:32:22,200 --> 03:32:29,020
plenty of time to get the rest of the stuff ready for the first so we'll probably do cooking sim vr

712
03:32:30,459 --> 03:32:41,799
blair witch vr and if i have time for one more maybe maybe among us vr would be a pretty pog day

734
03:37:08,860 --> 03:37:15,500
supposed to do all right so here's the thing that i need to grab this is the thing so this goes over

735
03:37:15,500 --> 03:37:55,989
here choose the board and put it in the x i did it i didn't do anything is everyone supposed to do

736
03:37:58,459 --> 03:38:12,120
complete okay uh now what one out of now how do i play welcome to the workshop begin a new project

737
03:38:12,600 --> 03:38:36,790
what's going on change on the projector measure oh it's a tutorial ah okay oh instructions saw the

738
03:38:36,790 --> 03:38:44,200
board to the correct length using the drawings as a reference submit for judgment okay so i gotta

739
03:38:44,200 --> 03:38:54,760
take that piece of wood and i've got to saw it 24 inches long so it's gotta be 24 inches long you

740
03:38:54,760 --> 03:39:16,420
got it 23 okay there needs to be so i have to saw it from here so i gotta saw it to that line

741
03:39:16,420 --> 03:39:21,850
because that's like 20 that's like just about 23 inches so now i got a saw

742
03:39:26,059 --> 03:39:37,510
that would be so scary grabbing it by the blade not a great idea by the way so how do i do this

743
03:39:37,510 --> 03:40:17,780
how does this work holy shit i just did it this is fun okay so this is 24 inches long

744
03:40:17,780 --> 03:40:52,549
get it on the x that's it right 63 percent how i thought it wanted to did i get it wrong

745
03:40:52,549 --> 03:41:14,860
that doesn't make sense i did it wasn't good enough what do you mean 24 inches long how does

746
03:41:14,860 --> 03:41:33,180
that make any sense 24 inches long oh a vice so what the hell use a pencil mark where 24 inches is

747
03:41:33,180 --> 03:42:20,309
23 that's 24 right here that's literally 24 inches that's off of the table okay that's 23

748
03:42:20,309 --> 03:42:54,120

749
03:42:54,120 --> 03:43:07,559
oh this one's gonna be fun please use the tape measure okay what do we got saw the board to the

750
03:43:07,559 --> 03:43:12,940
correct length using the drawing as a reference submit for judgment sleep tight okay but to make

751
03:43:12,940 --> 03:44:14,069
a cube that's easy that's easy okay that's i made a cube that's it it's a cube a cube is a cube

752
03:44:14,069 --> 03:44:31,129
hold on that was a shit cube you cut it diagonally no i didn't maybe a little but what does it matter

753
03:44:31,129 --> 03:44:57,540
can i do it again oh shit it is diagonal all right i had to get a this is the wrong way stop

754
03:45:23,700 --> 03:45:32,540
this one's worse i think you need to measure i don't like oh i don't like measuring i don't care

755
03:45:32,540 --> 03:45:40,649
who needs to measure all right get out of this chair i'm gonna fall down if this chair keeps

756
03:45:40,649 --> 03:45:45,450
getting in the way all right fine i'll measure it i'll do the stupid thing we go like this

757
03:45:48,170 --> 03:45:56,120
okay look sure here we go here's your edge here we go take a look here is it gonna be a perfect

758
03:45:56,120 --> 03:46:13,719
line wait how does it this doesn't matter if i draw a line it doesn't matter what if i go like

759
03:46:13,719 --> 03:46:36,170
this i don't get it read it this is i can't do this it's impossible measure how i've never taken

760
03:46:36,170 --> 03:46:50,280
a woodworking class please he doesn't know what i don't understand i don't know what to do no shit

761
03:46:50,280 --> 03:46:58,260
it's just geometry the last time i was in a geometry class class bill clinton was the president

762
03:46:58,260 --> 03:47:18,940
okay i don't remember anything from that class i don't know anything from that class all sides

763
03:47:19,020 --> 03:47:50,100
are equal oh i see what you mean by that it's perfect goddamn cube if i ever seen one what

764
03:47:50,100 --> 03:48:19,479
happened here i wonder if it's gonna be fucking right i'll tell you that the teacher doesn't even

765
03:48:19,479 --> 03:48:39,799
check anyways you go up there with a cube and they go yep that's that's a cube all right that's a

766
03:48:39,799 --> 03:49:09,559
passing grade i'll take a see whack whack he's pretending he has to be pretending oh wait nail

771
03:51:12,700 --> 03:51:33,770
they both are 24 inches long okay 24 inches long what if i just double them up that saves a bunch

772
03:51:33,770 --> 03:52:16,700
of shit a lot of time right the 24 inches long tape measure 25 24 25 20 i need the pencil 24 25

773
03:52:16,700 --> 03:52:50,149
25 okay i was saw if you picked up a tape measure you're reading centimeters what no what are you

774
03:52:50,149 --> 03:53:27,979
talking about why am i in the way okay get right there oh okay now they got these perfect now they

781
03:56:35,780 --> 03:56:46,760
be at least a 70 or 80 that's definitely going to be good that's a 98 percent all by the way i need

782
03:56:46,760 --> 03:57:09,190
a tape measure you sure almost almost 100 percent all right well now what stool sample i have to

786
03:58:26,299 --> 03:58:56,200
these two 18 inches is this whole thing to double 18 what is the measure how long is this whole thing
