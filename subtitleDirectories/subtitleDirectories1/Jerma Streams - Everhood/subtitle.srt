1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:13,750
Well hi. What's up? How are ya? Welcome to the stream, as always. My name is Jerbo985.

2
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:26,620
Did you already knew that? You clicked on it. Good afternoon, how are you? Do you? What is that?

3
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:31,510
Don't do anything cool while the ad is going. Oh my, you know what? That's a really good idea.

4
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:43,880
That's true. I should not say anything for the first five minutes ever of any stream. That's right.

5
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:56,979
Because a ton of people are coming in and getting a pre-roll. That's true.

6
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,219
All right, well let's just like do nothing. I do nothing for five to ten minutes anyways for the

7
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:09,030
first ten minutes of every stream. You're always late in the first place. You know, all right,

8
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,950
let me ask you guys something. Maybe we should poll the community on this because this is important.

9
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:24,359
If I were to hit the live button, right, at 4 p.m. specific, but I just was not here for at least

10
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:31,930
10 to 20 minutes, would you prefer that? Or would you prefer for me just to be ready to go

11
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:37,370
like when the stream comes on, you know within like two to three minutes that we're going to

12
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:43,590
start? What do you prefer? Would you rather just be late or do you want the stream to turn on at

13
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:51,370
four and have this screen on for like 15 to 20 minutes? All right, we want you ready to go.

14
00:01:52,090 --> 00:02:00,980
I'd rather you just be late. Okay, be late. All right, second one. Okay, turn it on so we can

15
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:10,039
listen to the music and watch the planets. Yeah, I'm talking about Monk. That's what I mean.

16
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:19,530
I was just watching your Thrillville VOD. I get five to ten instead of 20. Well, it is five.

17
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,409
It's 410 right now. I didn't start at 420.

18
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,949
We're going to play Everhood today. We're going to continue the playthrough.

19
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,449
I don't really know that much about... All right, so the last time I played this,

20
00:02:35,449 --> 00:02:45,419
I played it for like 40 minutes and it was really... I was like half a bottle down in wine.

21
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,680
I drank like half a bottle of wine. I was just playing it. I didn't really follow the story

22
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:56,840
that much that well. I remember it was fun, but people were like,

23
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:03,449
please, for the love of God, play this game again. I was like, all right, restart the game.

24
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:14,539
No, start over? No, I mean, I played it for like... I remember the gnome stuff. It was fun.

25
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:17,580
I remember the guy would be in like the club and the guy's like, we did like a dance battle.

26
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:35,349
Why do I sound like that? Stop. What's wrong with me? Yeah, but you were drunk.

27
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:40,539
So what? I started the game a little bit on the drunk side.

28
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:46,969
So what? I can't continue that playthrough. It needs to be a clean slate.

29
00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:57,289
Well, let me ask you this. How long is this game? Is this game like a four-hour experience?

30
00:03:57,289 --> 00:04:00,009
Is this game like a seven-hour experience? How long is the game?

31
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,849
It's like about seven hours. Okay. It's like six to seven. All right. Well then,

32
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:13,659
so then I can, I'm guaranteed to be able to finish it tonight then. Like six. Yeah. So then I'm

33
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:28,139
already like four. Yeah. No, no. We're not starting over. Let's go. You guys ready? I'll give... Okay.

34
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:35,500
Here's the story so far. Laser beam dance game. They shoot laser beams at you. You have to dodge

35
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,220
it. The music is to the music. There's a beat that plays in the background. You jump over the beat.

36
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:45,740
You dodge the beat and then you beat enemies based on dodging their musical attacks. That's

37
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:50,220
pretty much it. That's all you really need. It's pretty fun. I will tell you right now.

38
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:56,060
Let's get this out of the way as well. There's a, there's a flashing lights warning. I turned on

39
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:03,819
this thing here. So I, the image sensitivity I turned on because I don't really like getting

40
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:09,139
my like face like flashed and shit anyways. So, but just be aware this game is pretty,

41
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:18,300
if you photosensitive, this is like, this is going to be a doozy. Anyways, I'm ready to,

42
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:26,009
I'm ready to rock and roll. You should put up a warning. I think that, does that warning stay

43
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:39,189
in the corner? I don't remember. Let's see. I put it on hard? What? I played this on hard? What?

44
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:54,629
Why did you let me do that? Why would I be on the hardest difficulty guys? What? So this is,

45
00:05:54,629 --> 00:06:00,939
but we're only like 30 minutes into the game. I got into this castle. You're good at it. So

46
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:04,060
don't worry. I'll be all right. I got into the castle and I'm about to do like a big castle battle.

47
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:13,899
As expert as well. Yeah, I know. We tried to stop you. You insisted on it. Okay. Well,

48
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,740
you should put a warning on screen. Should I actually, because I will if I, if you think I

49
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:33,370
should. No, yes. Yeah. I'm getting a lot of yeses. You should. Yes. Put it in the title. My title is

50
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:38,970
like perfectly carefully comedically crafted. I don't think I want to do that. I'll put it on

51
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:48,740
screen. I'll just put it like kind of in the corner. Your title sucks. Oh yeah.

52
00:06:48,740 --> 00:07:13,779
I'm sorry. I've been in a weird mood lately. How's that? Can I have it like kind of down here?

53
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:25,370
Where should it go? Like up here? Is that all right? Is it okay? Put it right in the middle?

54
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:36,060
I'm not going to put it in the middle, dude. What are you talking about? Responsible Annie.

55
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:47,589
I think that's okay. Yeah. I think that's, that's all right. Put it in the stream title.

56
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:51,670
My stream title is perfectly crafted. All right. Well, all right. You guys saw that. Whatever.

57
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:56,069
Fuck. You guys saw the funny joke in the stream title. Who cares about the title? I'll put it in

58
00:07:56,069 --> 00:08:03,370
the stream title. You guys already saw the funny stream title, right? And everybody laughed and now

59
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:12,100
all right. Here we go. I, dude, I had this one. It's one of you required to feel the music.

60
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:32,179
Flashing lights. I put it right here. This title has so many brackets. This is the longest title

61
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:56,419
I think I've ever had. This title is too long now. Let me see. Is that better? There we go.

62
00:08:56,419 --> 00:09:01,139
Care as somebody said. I don't know. Okay. When I play, people tell me, play Ace Attorney, dude.

63
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:04,899
Play Ace Attorney. Ace Attorney is like so fucking fun. It's like the funnest game. You're going to

64
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:09,059
love it. That's, that's great. I tried to play it. I did because I always try to see if I can

65
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:15,639
record a game or capture it, make sure it doesn't look like shit, right? Um, I can't play Ace Attorney

66
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:20,120
because every 10 seconds the game decides to go like this and I don't know why it goes,

67
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:30,120
and it flashes a white light in your face. It happens every 10 seconds.

68
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,090
Anyways, the key to the locked door is somewhere in the maze. I put it there.

69
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:48,789
Maybe it was for the best. Okay. So I got to find the key. Why can't anyone hear me?

70
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:54,009
You were playing the game wrong. You should buy, buy a real copy of the game.

71
00:09:54,009 --> 00:10:01,929
It's funny you say that, sir or madam. I actually bought every single version of the game that was

72
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:07,299
available. I bought it on the iPad to see if it had, if it happened on the iPad. I got it across

73
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:15,580
every platform, steam, everywhere, consoles. I purchased that game probably four or five times

74
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:21,210
because I was hoping that one of these versions did not have the flashing white light.

75
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:32,519
Hi-ho-ha. Fancy seeing you here in such a spooky place. I am notice Freddy here. I've heard that

76
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:38,809
this castle has a heart and a soul. Hi, Fanta. What that really means? Maybe it has a secret rooms.

77
00:10:41,429 --> 00:11:04,009
Slime. Oh, here we go. Everybody get ready. First banger of the night incoming. You ready?

78
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:10,809
This is Flynn. Welcome to Slime Brothers Plank Service. My name is Flynn and my brother's name

79
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:17,350
is Muck. It's me. We provide a plank renting service. What kind of plank are you looking for?

80
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:24,600
I'm looking for a long plank. Long planks are my favorite, but sadly they are out of stock.

81
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:32,889
Welcome to Slime Brothers Plank Service. My name is Muck and my brother's name is Flynn.

82
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:42,940
Talk to my brother if you want to rent a plank. Welcome to Slime. That's not what he said. I forgot

83
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:50,409
everything about this guy. What was he? I forgot. Well, I don't remember. I'm not kidding. I don't

84
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:56,950
remember what he sounded like. I have no idea. Well, I don't know. I remember he was kind of

85
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:04,600
like Otto on the right, but what did he sound like? Hi, welcome to Slime Brothers Plank Service.

86
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:11,000
My name is Flynn and my brother's name is Muck. It's me. Yes, what do you want? Long plank. Whoa,

87
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:18,440
you know, very long planks are hard to handle. They come at a price. Are you sure? All right,

88
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:28,950
actually, for you to rent a very long plank, you also need. Shoot, I forgot. Hey, Goku. Yeah?

89
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:35,159
What do you need to rent a very long plank? You mean the diploma of certification for

90
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:42,360
handling very long planks? Right. Do you have a certificate for handling very long planks, sir?

91
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:48,919
Yes, I do. Hey, don't pull my leg. You don't have a certification. You're a funny guy. Of course,

92
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:55,399
you're wrong. Don't worry. It's on the house. Hey, Muck. What is it, Flynn? This wood face

93
00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:02,759
wants the diploma of certification for handling very long planks. Oh, really? Get ready, matey.

94
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:34,169
Let's go. Turn it up. Oh, this is good. I like it. This is a good song. I drank two copies,

95
00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:50,460
by the way, so there's no way I get hit again. Nice. Are they playing? Are they playing like

96
00:13:50,460 --> 00:14:18,980
guitars? Just like wood guitars. Oops. Oops. You are worthy of the diploma of certification

97
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:27,370
for handling very long planks. Now it's up on the wall. And of course, here's your very long plank.

98
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:45,100
God. Let's pick it up. You picked up the very long plank as my diploma. The diploma reads

99
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:51,399
diploma of certification for handling very long planks. One who has earned the certificate has

100
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,360
not only amassed a body of knowledge pursuant to handling very long planks, but also has demonstrated

101
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:02,779
proficiency in wicked dance moves and an impeccable personal style. Displayed in the medium of groovy

102
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:07,179
beats, we, the Slime Brothers Plank Service, present with this diploma evidence that they have

103
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:12,600
fulfilled all necessary requirements as given with confidence that the individual is equipped

104
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,509
by grace of Slime Brothers to meet their challenge in life as a strong, willful, and plank-possessing

105
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:26,620
individual. What a nice diploma. Please leave your diploma here. I have only five voices.

106
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:44,220
Okay, so I have a plank now. Where do I put that? Oh, it's this guy. I remember this guy.

107
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:53,509
Oh, it's you again. What the hell do you want? You'll be annoying somewhere else. I'm busy,

108
00:15:53,509 --> 00:16:12,809
can you tell? Fuck off. Here's the plank right here. Gotta be careful. Certified welder? Oh,

109
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:33,340
save the game. Right. I forgot the lanterns did that. Save. Hello? Nose-far-ot-choo.

110
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:42,419
That was a sneeze joke. I warn you red. Amazed monster lurks here. If it finds you,

111
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:54,620
try to scare it. Monster guards something. If. Sorry, forgot what it was.

112
00:16:55,179 --> 00:17:05,609
Okay, just look around here first. Are there any items in this game or is it just a bunch of

113
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:42,250
dances? What the fuck was that? Okay. Oh my god. Oh shit. Nice. Gotta stay on the left side after

114
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:59,619
this. Oh my god. Okay. Jesus. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. I'm ready. I'm ready. Holy shit.

115
00:18:00,339 --> 00:18:23,910
Oh my fucking lord. All right. I gotta, I gotta stay on the left side. Definitely.

116
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:44,950
Could be right. What the fuck am I supposed to do about that one? What was that button? That was

117
00:18:44,950 --> 00:19:04,089
like a Sonic the Hedgehog spring. Nice. All right. Fucking idiot. I need full health for this.

118
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:36,569
All right. All right. Right. Jesus god. I gotta get that one down. All right. So

119
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:49,799
what does the red button do? Do I touch the button? I like the song though. I gotta put

120
00:19:49,799 --> 00:20:02,859
both headphones in. That's a problem. Stupid fucking idiot. All right. Stop, stop, stop.

121
00:20:02,859 --> 00:20:56,809
Stop, stop. I jumped over the button. I button button. Where's the button? Here it comes. Fuck

122
00:20:56,809 --> 00:21:12,380
you. Fuck. Shut up. Not you. You don't have to shut up. It's me that has to shut up.

123
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:23,400
Ugh. All right. I swear to god. I'm just, it's, it's just a reaction. It's hitting the jump button

124
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:45,380
on everything. It's, I have to jump, jump, jump. Oh my god. He's running around. He's running around.

125
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:55,900
He's running around. What do I do? Where do I go? Oh, you found a crystal key. Give me out.

126
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:25,589
I hide. Oh, give me out. Can I dodge him when he goes down the hall? I did it. I got it. Maze

127
00:22:25,589 --> 00:22:46,180
monster lurks here. Okay. I got the key. So I got the key. Okay. This is my room. It ain't much.

128
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:58,200
Sorry. It'd be nice if I had some more furniture. Game console with super racket inserted.

129
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:13,210
Wanna play some super racket with me? Sure. Okay. I warn you. I'm quite good. Hey. Sega.

130
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:37,500
Oh, we actually are doing this. Deflect with X. Okay. Someone just did that inside of my head.

131
00:23:37,579 --> 00:23:42,759
That sucked. I don't want to hear that again. I don't want to hear that noise ever again.

132
00:23:42,759 --> 00:24:16,279
Okay. I can just, it's too much. If you ever want to play again, I will be here. That was kind of

133
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:25,460
cool. You're pretty good at this. I mean, I'm playing, I, I got to give myself credit.

134
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:32,950
If anything that you require me to press a button at a certain time, I've made this remark before

135
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:38,069
and some of the new viewers can listen to this as well. If a game has four face buttons and it's

136
00:24:38,069 --> 00:24:46,250
in a control stick, I will be able to do good at that game. If we're talking four buttons,

137
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:57,799
that's it. If there is like a dodge, a punch, and like a run, I will do good in that game.

138
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:13,529
Save the game, right? What about Minecraft? Well, no, no, no, no. So I'm sorry.

139
00:25:13,529 --> 00:25:18,569
Minecraft has way more shit to do. There's like a crafting menu. You have to press like a,

140
00:25:18,569 --> 00:25:23,430
you have to combine. No, no, no. If the only thing you do in the game is jump,

141
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:36,809
dodge and attack and move, I will be, I will win. Careful with that stuff. Doors unlocked.

142
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:45,539
What about Dark Souls? Well, here's the thing. Dark Souls, you don't, I could literally use the

143
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:48,500
default weapon in Dark Souls you find in the very beginning and you still get through the game.

144
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,680
You can find like some shitty katana on the ground in Dark Souls and you could,

145
00:25:54,680 --> 00:26:11,660
you could get through the game. It doesn't matter. Hey, did I lose? What happened? Oh,

146
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:33,349
okay. Okay. What? Okay. It's, I get it. Hey, you got to go up some, it's a joke. Up, up.

147
00:26:33,349 --> 00:26:46,180
How do I go up from here? Yeah. I'm not playing your game. That's down. How do I know which one

148
00:26:46,180 --> 00:27:04,650
goes up? Oh, okay. I got it. You picked up the handle piece of a door. I'm bored. I'm going to

149
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:09,930
go read Calvin and Hobbes. I mean, I've, I've completely, I put a stamp of approval on that.

150
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:20,549
Calvin and Hobbes is fucking one of the greatest ever. I, I, I can like say that that's a good

151
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:25,430
idea. I mean, like we've probably got like German 985, Calvin and Hobbes, and Garfield is like the

152
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:32,019
best cartoon characters probably ever, right? So that's okay. You have the biggest challenge ahead

153
00:27:32,019 --> 00:27:40,150
of you. This is the mirror of truth and I will allow you to leave my castle, which is probably

154
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:49,859
up here. John R. Buckle. I am royal guard of castle. My guard important. Very important.

155
00:27:52,539 --> 00:28:03,559
Enter alone only. What? Why? Rules are rules. I don't have any legs and this guy is mute.

156
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:23,640
Did you really deny us entrance? Hey, were you only? Okay. Hey, how's the mirror? Okay.

157
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:47,380
I, um, let's walk around it. I think you should keep trying to look at the mirror. Maybe try to

158
00:28:47,380 --> 00:29:12,490
examine it from the other sides. I just did that. This is my first dream. Say hi. What's going on?

159
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:24,809
Just stare at it? What if I just don't move and look at it? It's not even a mirror.

160
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:44,700
Okay. I don't, it's not doing anything. What? What's to happen? Oh, look at you. Look at me.

161
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:50,329
What gives you the right to come here and control me? I wish you would just leave.

162
00:29:50,970 --> 00:30:02,410
You disgust me. This wooden cage. Not always been like this. Divided myself into pieces.

163
00:30:05,589 --> 00:30:15,799
Everyone, once you leave, I have to deal with everything. He's made it a wood. It would be

164
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:22,809
like creaking and shit. I'm the actor. You're not an actor. I hate you for it. I wish you would just

165
00:30:22,809 --> 00:30:46,650
stop. I want you to leave. I don't want to talk to you again. This guy's so annoying. Okay. I leave.

166
00:30:46,650 --> 00:31:16,380
This is like, this is you and your emo phase. Talk to me. I'm rural guard. I guard important,

167
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:23,559
very important. I leave now? Well done, little puppet. You are a one step closer to helping us

168
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:31,700
all. In another time, you will come back and you will slay the beast within and passage will open.

169
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:49,130
The end is nearing us. You are now free to leave. Oh, hold on. My headphones got tied up. That's

170
00:31:49,130 --> 00:32:02,869
kind of hard to use. This is kind of cool. I should play Noita. I have played Noita and it created a

171
00:32:02,869 --> 00:32:13,130
big problem for me. All right. Yeah. I'm just untying my headphones so they can sit on my ears

172
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:27,430
better. Okay. What's over here? Come on and experience the race of your lifetime. We let's

173
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:46,440
go. All right. It's pretty good. Oh, look at them braces go. Someday I hope to win. My sibling is

174
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:52,200
into fantasy games. All right. I'll tell you, I have both headphones in and it's loud for me because

175
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,559
obviously I want to feel the music. That's a requirement. Otherwise, you know, the exit signs.

176
00:32:56,359 --> 00:33:00,599
So, but I can, I can't hear myself talk. So it's hard to like talk. I don't even know what I sound

177
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:12,140
like right now. I have no idea what I sound like. You sound like you're drunk. I'm so, I can't hear

178
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:25,940
myself talk, which means I can't talk well. Why me? Why me? Why me? It's the point of learning

179
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:31,910
new skills. You'll just get bored and forget all that knowledge over time. Maintaining your driving

180
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:37,029
skills, for example. What does anyone get out of that anyways? I guess when it comes down to it,

181
00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:41,509
I need to stop thinking about the future. Enjoy what's in front of me instead of what's ahead.

182
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:47,480
So that's why they've had like 10 wow expansions. The exact reason you're describing.

183
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:54,710
I have to treat my life like I'm going through a cave full of gems and try to collect as many as

184
00:33:54,710 --> 00:34:03,509
I can because otherwise what's the point? Wow reference minus two. No, no, it wasn't. No,

185
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:11,340
it wasn't. Hi there, a red rider. Can you smell the gasoline? Can you feel the thrill? Are you

186
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:20,699
getting pumped? Do you want to participate in the race? Yes. Oh, exciting. Let us get you our cart.

187
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:33,289
Wait, I actually get to drive this? Welcome all racers. Tonight and all other nights,

188
00:34:33,289 --> 00:34:46,599
we will race until the end of time. Why am I the other way back here? This isn't fair. What?

189
00:34:48,199 --> 00:35:05,000
Brattle is A. Oh my God. Are you serious? I'm so bad at games like this. I thought I had to pick

190
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:15,800
stuff up. I don't know. I just, I thought I had to pick something up. Oh, this is crazy.

191
00:35:18,329 --> 00:35:20,570
Shit. I'm not going to be able to beat this. I can't win this.

192
00:35:21,929 --> 00:35:33,900
My God, it's too fast. No, I'm just towed. Oh, this is what it feels like to be fucking towed.

193
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:51,530
I'm in 20th place still. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it.

194
00:35:53,480 --> 00:36:01,260
Fuck. It's hard. Don't get lapped like towed. Don't get lapped like towed on Bowser's cape, please.

195
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:13,699
It's hard to tell where they're coming at that down the road.

196
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:43,780
It's too hard. It's no idea. It's too much. Both headphones in visual stimulation.

197
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:56,099
I'm going at warp speed. I'll get it. I'll get it. Just relax everybody. Hold on.

198
00:36:57,139 --> 00:37:49,239
All right. There we go. There we go. Slow down. Come on. Come on. Right for the middle.

199
00:37:49,239 --> 00:38:11,500
Come on. It's right there. Damn it. How? No, no, it's right here. I, I still got it. I have a chance.

200
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:18,440
Oh, that was a choke. It was a choke. It's all right. I get it this time.

201
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:54,809
Okay. Let's go. Let's go. I'm coming to first place now. Let's go. See, now I get it right here.

202
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:18,460
You pushed me off the road. Fuck you. Don't hold the acceleration the whole time.

203
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:37,880
In much better position than I was last time. Red is climbing through the ranks.

204
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:58,619
Who's in first place? It's always Mario and Luigi. It's such poor shit. And if you get even remotely

205
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:08,070
close to either one of those two assholes, they go. And they don't even have a star. It's so fucking

206
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:30,739
stupid. That game sucks. All right. Hold on. Don't blow it. Can anybody even hear me? I don't even

207
00:40:30,739 --> 00:40:50,630
know what I'm gonna be talking. Hey, good. Just don't hit anything. I'm right here.

208
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:25,659
It's right behind me. It's right up ahead. Oh, I just scared the shit out of me. Yes. Yes. Nice.

209
00:41:25,659 --> 00:41:33,030
All right. I guess you can hear what I was saying. Anytime in Mario, uh, Mario Kart Super Nintendo,

210
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:43,159
you get close to Mario or Luigi. They just have a star. It's so, it's annoying. They're always in

211
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:54,460
first and second place. Congratulations on finishing in first place. Here is your trophy.

212
00:41:55,579 --> 00:42:08,889
Oh, trophy. You picked up a trophy. What does that do? Do it multiple times. Wait, do the race

213
00:42:08,889 --> 00:42:18,550
multiple times? It doesn't do anything. It does literally nothing. Oh, that's still fun. Hi, ho.

214
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:26,420
Welcome. Welcome. I am Cassius. Come and run my humble obstacle course. It ain't much, but it's

215
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:31,780
something. Hi. I will reward you with something yummy. If you beat the universal record,

216
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:39,420
you want to run the obstacle course? Make sure to stretch first. I'm not muted. Stop. I can see my

217
00:42:39,420 --> 00:43:01,769
indicators. Ready? Three, two, one, action. Oh, this is bad. I got to use analog for this. Or do I?

218
00:43:01,769 --> 00:43:29,260
How do I sprint? Oh, did I do it? I got it. You beat the record. Receive your award outside.

219
00:43:30,219 --> 00:43:42,570
Well done. You'll be rewarded with a homemade, delicious, scrumptious cake. Okay. Maybe you can

220
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:52,380
give it to a friend. Picked up a cake. I like this kind of little mini games. I like this.

221
00:43:52,380 --> 00:44:11,030
Only VIPs allowed. Oh, no need to eat. I know the taste. Anything else I can do? What's he doing?

222
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:27,530
Look at them racers go. Okay. Okay. So that's, I got to go in the VIP room. Let's do it.

223
00:44:28,489 --> 00:44:38,469
Who are we theater? Who are we watching? Hello Red. I sometimes come here to relax.

224
00:44:41,139 --> 00:44:49,369
Just to let my mind wander a bit and forget about it all. I got it right. Good. Sorry.

225
00:44:53,480 --> 00:45:03,159
Here comes my favorite part. Wow, that was cool. Look at that. I got to share that with you stranger.

226
00:45:10,489 --> 00:45:27,769
Okay. Anything I can do over here? Dude, this would be so bad for you. Imagine sitting this

227
00:45:27,769 --> 00:45:34,409
close to a screen like this and having your eyes open. Oh, it hurts to think about that.

228
00:45:40,409 --> 00:45:57,820
All right. That was cool. This is fun. Imagine being that close to your stream.

229
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:15,380
VOD watcher point of view. We had a good time. It didn't. It's not the door we came from.

230
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:47,159
That was quite a fall. Okay. What's up with this? He picked up a shiny gem. He over here.

231
00:46:47,159 --> 00:47:23,769
Wait, did I look up here? I like the song so far. This is the best song, best character coming up.

232
00:47:23,769 --> 00:47:48,539
Cool. Whoa. What's that? You found my eye. Please give it to me. Sure. Yes, I am finally restored.

233
00:47:51,989 --> 00:47:56,699
I can't believe you have all people saved me. What's that supposed to mean?

234
00:47:57,179 --> 00:48:06,860
Are you here as well, little red nose? Aiding the enemy? What? The enemy? The enemy is gold pig.

235
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:19,059
I might have been lost to the woods for ages, but you are the one who is truly lost. Anyway,

236
00:48:19,059 --> 00:48:25,139
I am not without honor. You have helped me. So I am in your debt. Now that my vision is restored,

237
00:48:25,139 --> 00:48:31,460
I can use my magic. You seem to be missing an arm. Maybe I can help by removing this giant

238
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:41,159
boulder in your way. Should we teleport it away? Destroy it? Why not transform it?

239
00:48:42,739 --> 00:48:50,170
Now it's a Mario cube. How delightful. Maze transformed the giant rock into a clay pod.

240
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:56,070
This is what happens when you do voices for too long. I will now consider the debt repaid.

241
00:48:56,869 --> 00:49:00,789
I am still thankful for you bringing me my eye, red. I will remember that.

242
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:23,099
You can go now. There is no reason for you to continue to stand there. Apparently. Hey,

243
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:30,579
hold on a second. Now that the debt has been repaid, you are still the enemy.

244
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:37,699
Seeing you in such a weakened state, it would be unfortunate if I didn't, you know, exploit the

245
00:49:37,699 --> 00:50:41,960
situation. Oh, I didn't press the button. This might be my favorite song so far. Oh, damn. Seems

246
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:47,719
you are still strong even without your arm. But you know, I don't really care about any of this.

247
00:50:47,719 --> 00:50:52,679
I just want to have a good time. Thanks to you now I can. I won't forget that you helped me.

248
00:50:52,679 --> 00:50:58,760
I won't bother you anymore unless you bother me. Have fun in the mushroom forest. I have enjoyed

249
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:04,119
enough here without going insane. That reminds me, I'm extremely late to an appointment. See you

250
00:51:04,119 --> 00:51:15,449
around. Are we in the mushroom forest? Well, this is on hard. There's something about this place I

251
00:51:15,449 --> 00:51:42,860
can't remember. Funny. Wait, this looks like a cave. Oh, oops. I feel like this is about to get weird.

252
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:59,019
Everything's slowing down. I obviously follow the rabbit, but. I am the guardian of the mushroom

253
00:51:59,019 --> 00:52:05,820
forest. There will come a time when we shall talk, but it will not be tonight.

254
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:30,809
So unfair. Everyone took the good hiding places. You still have seven to find. Oh, great. You found

255
00:52:30,809 --> 00:52:41,210
me. I don't consider myself so good at hiding as the others. We still have six to find. Whoa,

256
00:52:42,599 --> 00:53:01,079
you found me. You still have to find five more. See you around, dude. Oh, thank God. Are you Swedish?

257
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:09,820
No. If you spend too much time in the mushroom forest, you might change. What does that mean?

258
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:23,940
Oh, you found me. I think you should be reevaluating my invisibility spell. You

259
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:29,480
still have four to find. By the way, we never figured out what that was from. It was not from

260
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:47,320
that TV show. I don't know what it's from. Oh, you really stepped into something bad now.

261
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:59,400
Another weirdo. Oh, let me get my weirdo voice ready. One, two, three, me, me, me, weirdo. Incoming.

262
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:05,800
I have finally caught the wooden pestilence. I'll make sure it won't be able to escape.

263
00:54:06,519 --> 00:54:17,480
With my defibrillatory stun gun, it will hurt. It will take months before we can use that stun gun

264
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:23,159
again. We'd better make the best out of this opportunity. Grundel, go pick it up and bring

265
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:31,860
it to the land now, Grundel. What are you doing? Hurry up. I've had enough of a weirdo for you.

266
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:55,699
You doofus. Here comes the weird guy. Don't you know that Gerber does weird characters

267
00:54:55,699 --> 00:55:01,349
and he loves to do them. Even though they all sound like this. Every single one of them.

268
00:55:01,349 --> 00:55:13,610
It works, I think, though, for most characters. You got to just do the weird guy. That's it.

269
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:30,570
I thought I was supposed to find mushrooms. Oh, back to the bunny. I mean, I just got

270
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:39,590
captured. What are you talking about? What happened? Never mind. You can't talk anyway.

271
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:48,760
Kick me up and let's get out of here. I do anything else here? He's doing anything?

272
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:53,639
I don't even want to talk about the things I've seen here. You can save your progress here.

273
00:55:53,639 --> 00:56:08,980
Do you want to save? Yes. Good luck getting out of here. Are you going in the light? Get out of the

274
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:25,030
way. Step away or prepare for trouble. I wonder what this song will be. He's got one huge arm.

275
00:56:26,869 --> 00:57:19,960
Not bad so far. Oh, my lord. Oh, fuck. God damn it. That got hard. Relax, relax, relax, relax, relax,

276
00:57:19,960 --> 00:58:00,309
relax. You got to hug the left side when he does that weird bone. Here we go. You idiot.

277
00:58:00,309 --> 00:58:40,710
That was so easy. You good? All right. That was a good one, too.

278
00:58:40,710 --> 00:59:03,110
I didn't do it. I promise. I didn't do it. No, I didn't. Strange looking machine.

279
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:15,639
You have awakened just in time. My masterpiece is about to be unleashed.

280
00:59:15,639 --> 00:59:18,969
I have constructed an artificial replication of an ancient creature.

281
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:24,010
Its raw energy makes it so powerful that it can only exist for a limited time.

282
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:30,070
The only chance to bring you down and establish peace once and for all. Prepare to face your doom,

283
00:59:30,070 --> 01:00:12,300
red beige. What's wrong? What happened? Did I lose? What? How could you have defeated my masterpiece

284
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:19,980
so swiftly? It didn't even stand a chance. Even more powerful than I imagined. It must be another

285
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:36,519
way. We will meet again, red marauder. Okay. The door is shut tight. All right. Go get the

286
01:00:36,519 --> 01:00:44,219
mushrooms. Go back and get the mushrooms. Can I get, can I go back from here? There's no door.

287
01:00:44,219 --> 01:01:07,929
I can't go anywhere from here. Are you enjoying the game? This is great to go down. What the hell

288
01:01:07,929 --> 01:01:21,159
is going on in here? This is freaking me out. Oh, actually, you know what? You're going to think

289
01:01:21,159 --> 01:01:27,000
I'm crazy for a second, but trust me, I'm doing this for a reason. I need to move that over the

290
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:32,440
dead pixel. Let me get it in the right spot. I have a dead pixel on my monitor. And I think

291
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:39,000
that actually, if I move it to this right spot, it'll fix it. Right. Let's see. It's like, how do

292
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:50,420
I move it? I can move it over here. All right. It's, it's on the dead pixel right now. It only

293
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:57,590
works for some types of, it takes hours for that shit to work. Does it? It's not going to work if

294
01:01:57,590 --> 01:02:07,480
I sit here. Oh, well. Yeah. It's, it's green. The pixels. So it's not a dead pixel. It's a stuck pixel.

295
01:02:08,119 --> 01:02:14,440
All right. Who are you? You're everywhere. What do they want? Let me be. I don't want to make it

296
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:18,920
stop. I don't want to make it stop. Make it stop. Make it stop. Make it stop. Make it stop. Make it

297
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:26,579
stop. Make it stop. The TV. How long must I endure? How long has it been? How long has it been? How

298
01:02:26,579 --> 01:02:32,869
long has it been? Who said that? Who's there? Stop laughing at me. It hurts. I just want it to stop.

299
01:02:32,869 --> 01:02:36,389
It hurts. Just want to stop. Rest a bit. Please. I don't want it to just stop. I don't want it to

300
01:02:36,389 --> 01:02:40,469
hurt. Stop it. Don't do it. Stop. Stop it. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop it. All right. I'm getting out

301
01:02:40,469 --> 01:02:45,880
of here. No, I didn't want to do that again. Do I keep talking to them? It never ends. Why won't it

302
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:52,219
end? Must I suffer forever? It never ends. That damn mage. Why does it torture me? I want to leave.

303
01:02:52,219 --> 01:03:00,119
I don't know where to go. I'm useless. They're everywhere. Okay. Well, I turned off the TV. Can

304
01:03:00,119 --> 01:03:15,820
they leave now? I don't know. It's an average Jerma viewer. You can, you can leave whenever you want.

305
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:36,900
I don't know. I'm not holding you here. Why do you think we can leave? I don't know because you can.

306
01:03:38,019 --> 01:03:45,449
All the circumstances are optimal. I have analyzed the triggering factors of what is considered a

307
01:03:45,449 --> 01:03:51,050
battle using quantum theory to artificially create a battle that is not considered a battle.

308
01:03:53,019 --> 01:03:57,420
You can't resort to your dirty tricks, red mage. This will be the end of you.

309
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:47,289
Oh, I can run. There's no jumping. All right. What do you got? What do you got? What do you got?

310
01:04:47,289 --> 01:05:41,239
What's going on? I have to attack it? Yikes. Yikes. Oh, I thought it was over.

311
01:05:55,559 --> 01:06:09,880
Fuck. That was sick. Remarkable. My efforts have proven futile once again. Is there nothing that

312
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:16,789
can stop you? Hope you find it in your heart to forgive my actions. I just want to find a solution.

313
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:27,800
This won't be the last time we meet, red mage. That was cool. I can go in there.

314
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:36,440
We're all being paid by your mother to watch this stream. None of them want to be here.

315
01:06:36,679 --> 01:06:45,059
Nobody wants to be here. Okay. If my mother was paying each of you $1 to be here every stream,

316
01:06:45,059 --> 01:06:54,010
that's almost $17,000 a stream. That's extreme. I stream probably two days a week.

317
01:06:54,570 --> 01:07:01,110
You're talking about like $40,000 a week that my mother is paying to have you all be here.

318
01:07:01,110 --> 01:07:08,570
But that's $160,000 a month. So you're telling me that my mother is spending more than 1.1 or

319
01:07:08,570 --> 01:07:13,369
1.2 million dollars a year just to have you stay here and pretend to like the stream.

320
01:07:13,369 --> 01:07:25,000
And that's only if you were getting $1 to be here. And I'll be honest with you, right? Think about

321
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:30,900
that. If somebody were to ask you to, hey, I want you to go watch this stream for, you know,

322
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:35,719
four to six hours, I'll give you a dollar. You'd be like, no fucking way. You'd be like, make it

323
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:42,519
$50. You're not doing that for a dollar. You're doing that for at least like $30 to $40, at least.

324
01:07:42,519 --> 01:07:51,639
There's no way you're going to do that for that little. Like, if my mother's not giving you at

325
01:07:51,639 --> 01:07:57,849
least like a 20 or like at least about 30 bucks to be there. Uh-uh. There's no way. I want to get

326
01:07:57,849 --> 01:08:09,820
that. Can you imagine? Can you actually imagine if like, I was actually truly paying people to stay

327
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:17,930
here and you guys are not bots. You're just, I'm actually like hiring people to pretend to be an

328
01:08:17,930 --> 01:08:39,939
audience. That would be so weird. When's the paycheck? Okay. No, no, no, don't go back in.

329
01:08:40,659 --> 01:08:49,689
Happy Saturday. Yeah. Happy Saturday. Okay. Now we're looking for the mushrooms or maybe not.

330
01:08:49,689 --> 01:09:04,020
Professor Orange has sent a message. They have failed to annihilate the doll.

331
01:09:04,819 --> 01:09:12,649
Yes. But then we moved back to our hideout. That doll to the hillside back. It's a grand similar

332
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:18,859
affection. Orange messages that there is a doll picked at the blue door piece that Orange has

333
01:09:18,859 --> 01:09:28,550
left before it left. What? Sir, the doll has given the kiss, the cursed kiss. Yes. The doll

334
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:39,500
is still there. The doll can hear us. It's using some sort of telepathic magic.

335
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:46,779
How long is it with this thing? I can just swap the magic if you desire, golden pig.

336
01:09:47,899 --> 01:10:07,770
Not another word. I'll do it right. I'll do it myself. Are you all right?

337
01:10:11,689 --> 01:10:42,260
Okay. You kind of Zoey's out there for a while. Looking for mushrooms. Can I run down?

338
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:54,260
I'm not making any sense. I made it to the other side. All right. Mushrooms. Hello there.

339
01:10:54,260 --> 01:11:07,340
Do you want to save? Yes, I do. Change. All right. All right. All right. Hi. I guess you found me.

340
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:23,529
You still have three to find. Bye. Three more. I think I already went up by this one. Oh, hello.

341
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:36,460
I guess you did find me. You still have two to find. Well, find the bunny. All right. I'll get

342
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:48,149
the bunny. I already went up here. Is this one? Oh, you found me. I knew I should have

343
01:11:48,149 --> 01:11:54,680
chosen a better hiding spot. You still have one to find. Oh, don't even start doing more to you,

344
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:59,670
idiot. All right. I got them all. Hi. It was the last mushroom. We'll be waiting by the forest

345
01:11:59,670 --> 01:12:23,430
guardian far to the west. Whoa. Oh, it's this person. Right. Okay. Right now you are the

346
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:32,569
annoying audio book voice actor you complained about. I'm not. No, I'm not actually. No, I didn't

347
01:12:32,569 --> 01:12:38,739
complain about audio books. I just said it's hard to be an audio book voice narrator because

348
01:12:38,739 --> 01:12:44,789
you have to do like 60 people's voices over the course of the whole story because even the best

349
01:12:44,789 --> 01:12:48,789
voice actors in the room in the room, I was going to say even the best voice actors in the room.

350
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:53,670
If you tell them to do all their voices back to back to back to back,

351
01:12:54,470 --> 01:13:00,229
you will be able to tell it's the same person. You will. Nobody can be different people.

352
01:13:00,789 --> 01:13:12,579
For instance, I am the guardian of the Muslim forest. I will open a passage for you. Let me

353
01:13:12,579 --> 01:13:18,819
tell you that this is entirely optional. You're not forced to be here. This is only for those

354
01:13:18,819 --> 01:13:27,220
seeking answers. There will come a time when we shall talk, but it will not be tonight.

355
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:37,189
Hey, that was me talking. You knew that was me talking. Why? Why can't I go in there? He

356
01:13:37,189 --> 01:13:48,899
found us all. What the hell? Hi there. You found us. Go talk to the divine mushroom.

357
01:13:48,899 --> 01:14:10,760
Look at the divine mushroom. Welcome to my domain. Your efforts in indulging my kin.

358
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:23,180
For giving them some joy, I cannot offer you much. I can't offer you much, but I can give you

359
01:14:23,819 --> 01:14:31,449
a bathroom break. You need to pee very badly. Enjoy the break while you pee.

360
01:14:33,210 --> 01:14:41,979
Drinking water all day. Be right back before I do another big, big one. Oh,

361
01:14:41,979 --> 01:18:38,250
it's still the Christmas thing. Hey, it's still Christmas in my mind. I'll be right back. I just

362
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:45,100
want to grab some beef jerky too. I promise that I won't choke on it and inhale it like I did in the

363
01:18:45,100 --> 01:19:02,100
little ring string. Sponsored? I didn't tell you what brand I'm eating. Sponsored by who?

364
01:19:10,149 --> 01:19:25,079
Sponsored by the beef industry. Beef industry sponsor. I'm not in Congress. I don't have

365
01:19:25,079 --> 01:19:32,300
lobbyists. What are you talking about? I really liked his streams. Once the big beef industry

366
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:50,539
got involved and started lobbying him. What? All right. I'm ready. What'd you say? I like this

367
01:19:50,539 --> 01:19:58,710
comment. I bet your breath always smells like you just ate jerky. It's not garlic. I'm not eating

368
01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:02,949
cloves of garlic. Beef jerky does not stay with you in your clothes and shit. It's just like

369
01:20:02,949 --> 01:20:26,899
fucking, what are you talking about? What are you on about? It still has an aroma. Okay. What

370
01:20:26,899 --> 01:20:34,789
about every other food? Do you have like, like chicken nugget breath? Did you eat a bowl of

371
01:20:34,789 --> 01:20:41,510
cereal? Are you going to have like, like wheat grass on your breath? No, I think your breath

372
01:20:41,510 --> 01:20:48,170
just stinks. That's it. Nobody knows what you had for dinner. They just know that you smell.

373
01:20:59,079 --> 01:21:07,670
Holly's. There you go. There's your proof. Holly literally just said, I don't smell like beef.

374
01:21:07,670 --> 01:21:25,079
Like I don't smell like a meat aroma. Confirmed. My headcanon is that you smell like weed.

375
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:37,449
Why wouldn't, why are you headcanoning what I smell like? You know what? You know what I do smell

376
01:21:37,449 --> 01:21:51,750
like? I smell like a dryer sheet. I smell like a dryer sheet and motor oil together. You know,

377
01:21:51,750 --> 01:22:01,050
you understand? Like it's just light motor oil and dryer sheet. Maybe like a hint of grilled onions.

378
01:22:13,819 --> 01:22:20,649
What a disgusting smell. Are you willing to risk your soul? Yes. I am neither glad nor sad. You

379
01:22:20,649 --> 01:22:27,979
smell like piss. I do not smell like piss. I'm very, if I'm not going to mess around and be

380
01:22:27,979 --> 01:22:34,229
honest with you, I'm very aware of how I smell. I always am trying to be like clean. I always want

381
01:22:34,229 --> 01:22:38,649
my clothes to be clean. I always want to be able to have a shower before I go anywhere or do anything.

382
01:22:38,649 --> 01:22:49,720
I always am very aware of my like cleanliness of my body. Just go. All right. Settle down. Relax.

383
01:22:49,720 --> 01:23:06,470
I'm just hanging out. Find peace in your endeavors. Take a few steps back, please.

384
01:23:06,470 --> 01:23:47,819
Good. Now let this happen. Things might get strange. Ow. All right. It's a worm fight. Whoa.

385
01:23:49,609 --> 01:24:28,439
Time to get weird. What the fuck? Shit. Whoa. I can't even see that. Hello, human.

386
01:24:31,779 --> 01:24:48,729
And you see us. I don't know what I'm supposed to be looking for. Jesus. Why are you here?

387
01:24:49,529 --> 01:25:21,930
Oh, fuck. This is so wild. You are hurting. Please quit. Never. I'll never quit.

388
01:25:22,569 --> 01:25:35,430
I will give it 100% always and potentially go beyond. 110%. I hurt my throat doing that. Why?

389
01:26:23,180 --> 01:26:37,689
Seems that you are back. Did you know what you were getting yourself into?

390
01:26:38,250 --> 01:26:47,079
You don't have to keep coming back. You're always watching. I hope you're enjoying yourself.

391
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:56,039
That you have something to do. Being it. It's not always easy. Have you come to hear an absolute

392
01:26:56,039 --> 01:27:07,180
truth? Yes. There is a risk you might change upon hearing it. Sometimes not for the better.

393
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:21,659
Are you sure you want to hear an absolute truth? It doesn't feel like the machine else come in.

394
01:27:21,739 --> 01:27:33,189
There are several absolute truths. One of them is you are me and I am you.

395
01:27:34,069 --> 01:27:43,510
Even the ones you hate and love remain true to yourself. Your thoughts were never yours anyways.

396
01:27:44,699 --> 01:27:52,789
Take this truth and it is now in your hands to truly interpret. It's humor is how you wanted

397
01:27:52,789 --> 01:27:58,739
to experience this life. I told you many times to not go through with this. I thought it would be

398
01:27:58,739 --> 01:28:06,539
fun and here you are. We look forward to sitting talking and laughing about all this when you

399
01:28:06,539 --> 01:28:14,010
return. You must go forward. We will let you return to your world. We hope you find what

400
01:28:14,010 --> 01:28:25,619
you're looking for. You must now leave. It's turning British. Welcome back. I hope you enjoyed

401
01:28:25,619 --> 01:28:31,399
that experience. You strike me as an adventurous sport. Take this precious gemstone. It might be

402
01:28:31,399 --> 01:28:47,380
useful someday. Maybe not this day. You picked up a ruby. Thanks. All right. New item. Can I go in

403
01:28:47,380 --> 01:28:55,979
here now? Guarding the forest. Do I have to pay him in a ruby? You smell like Sour Patch Kids

404
01:28:55,979 --> 01:29:10,470
and old cigarette butts. So I smell like a movie theater? I smell like the outside of a movie

405
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:27,659
theater. Now that's an absolute truth. All right. Whatever. Would you like an absolute truth? Yes.

406
01:29:29,350 --> 01:29:34,949
You smell like Sour Patch Kids and cigarette butts. That would be so funny. I wish they would put that

407
01:29:34,949 --> 01:29:43,369
in here. An absolute truth. Your breath is awful. It smells like you just opened up a tuna can

408
01:29:45,909 --> 01:29:52,489
and put it inside of a dog shit bag. I hope you found something extraordinary.

409
01:29:53,449 --> 01:30:17,689
You can now return to your realm. Okay. Damn. All right. That was cool. He's just frog.

410
01:30:20,859 --> 01:30:29,029
Enjoying ourselves? Nope. This is quite a strange world. This realm has a way of

411
01:30:29,029 --> 01:30:36,539
cutting right into the heart. It is natural it becomes this way for immortals. I like it for

412
01:30:36,539 --> 01:30:45,210
what it is. I will be expecting many great things from you. It will get harder in ways

413
01:30:45,210 --> 01:30:54,420
you might not be able to imagine. Voice is bad. Voice is bad. Shitty voice. Worst voice. Okay,

414
01:30:54,420 --> 01:31:02,899
fine. I'll give you one that you like. But I shouldn't let you worry too much. You're ever

415
01:31:02,899 --> 01:31:11,909
lost. Maybe talk to your blue friend. I bet they have a keen sense of direction.

416
01:31:11,989 --> 01:31:16,949
Opposite ends of the spectrum for horrible. And not getting the good one. I know you want it to

417
01:31:16,949 --> 01:31:24,359
be like, all right, if you're ever lost, maybe talk to your blue friend. I bet they have a keen

418
01:31:24,359 --> 01:31:35,479
sense of direction. Now that would have been good, right? Hey, you fine piece of craftsmanship.

419
01:31:35,479 --> 01:31:50,569
Want to swing by Midnight Town. The nicest place around. That was a perfect voice for a frog where

420
01:31:50,569 --> 01:31:58,970
the world wasn't ready for it. Trust me, I know. All right, we've got a lot of places I can go.

421
01:31:58,970 --> 01:32:03,430
Is this kind of like the Mega Man open world screen? Do I just pick a world and go?

422
01:32:03,430 --> 01:32:33,029
Hey Red, instead of going back there, how about we go to Midnight Town? Cool. Time is only temporary.

423
01:32:33,029 --> 01:32:47,819
True. What's this? Casino? What are we playing? Looking forward to playing. It's fun pretending

424
01:32:47,819 --> 01:32:54,170
to be someone else. Oh, it's just, it's like D&D. I can't wait to get started. Hi there, Red. We can

425
01:32:54,170 --> 01:33:00,789
finally start the game. Let's go. Certainly is out of my comfort zone, but I don't have anything else

426
01:33:00,789 --> 01:33:10,409
to do. Sorry, well done, but I do like your company. Okay, Red, there's still room for one

427
01:33:10,409 --> 01:33:18,949
more player if you want to join. I promise you it's going to be blast. All right. Yeah, let's play.

428
01:33:18,949 --> 01:33:26,409
Wait, what's in here? The hatch is shut tight. You can't get it open. Seems we're all finally here.

429
01:33:26,409 --> 01:33:42,250
Now, are you ready? Ready for an epic adventure? Yes. Good. Let me just set the mood. Let the

430
01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:52,659
adventure begin. Once upon a time, in the land of Medallion, there was a village whose name had

431
01:33:52,659 --> 01:34:00,010
been forgotten. The little town was settled with happy, hard-working villagers. But beyond the lake,

432
01:34:00,729 --> 01:34:10,119
deep in the darkness, stood a tower so tall that it reached the clouds. The villagers could see

433
01:34:10,119 --> 01:34:17,859
mysterious lights and shadows moving at the top of the tower, fearing that an evil wizard had

434
01:34:17,859 --> 01:34:24,020
taken hold of the tower. The townspeople hoped for a hero to save them from their presumably ill

435
01:34:24,020 --> 01:34:31,989
fate. Within the village was a temple that protected an ancient relic capable of withstanding evil.

436
01:34:37,020 --> 01:34:48,789
Sword that deflects, Red attacks. Really? That's a really dumb name. I find it quite descriptive.

437
01:34:49,989 --> 01:35:02,020
Guys, please don't interrupt. During a dark, rainy night, a warrior entered the temple.

438
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:20,170
Oh, great warrior, take this sword, our most valuable relic. Vanquish all the evil and save

439
01:35:20,170 --> 01:35:37,899
our small village. Receive this sword and gain its powers of deflecting red attacks. With this power,

440
01:35:37,899 --> 01:35:47,350
you might be able to face the evil wizard. Now before- what the fuck? Give me all your treasure

441
01:35:48,069 --> 01:35:54,060
or pay with your lives. Oh, great warrior, we're helpless. Save us from this foul bandit.

442
01:35:54,140 --> 01:36:35,579
I can deflect red, deflect his X, okay. Get out of town. You have bested me.

443
01:36:36,460 --> 01:36:49,289
You saved us, oh great warrior. Hooray. Hooray. Hooray. Now make haste to the tower and defeat the

444
01:36:51,930 --> 01:37:00,890
evil wizard. The warrior has a quest. Little did the warrior know what terrible challenges were

445
01:37:00,890 --> 01:37:08,310
ahead. Seems like such a waste of time. We could be doing something more important, Red.

446
01:37:10,579 --> 01:37:11,380
Mermaid man.

447
01:37:16,979 --> 01:37:22,180
No, we need to get into the boat and go get them, SpongeBob.

448
01:37:22,180 --> 01:37:25,930
What are you doing, you old moron?

449
01:37:27,109 --> 01:37:36,260
I am trying to do what it is a superhero must be doing, getting to the bank.

450
01:37:36,260 --> 01:37:40,380
We cast that check two days ago.

451
01:37:40,380 --> 01:37:47,579
What? I have no idea what you're talking about. That wasn't SpongeBob, that was Barnacle Boy.

452
01:37:47,659 --> 01:37:58,359
I have no idea what you're talking about. I'm glad you're the warrior, Red.

453
01:37:58,359 --> 01:38:04,220
All right, get to the tower and fight. Yeah, that was Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.

454
01:38:04,779 --> 01:38:15,829
That wasn't SpongeBob. Oh, this is cool. I like this. Mood, yes.

455
01:38:30,140 --> 01:38:40,020
Fake SpongeBob fans. So what, we're playing D&D right now? Is that what this is supposed to be?

456
01:38:40,819 --> 01:38:46,180
Hey there, Red. Are you on your quest to slay the evil wizard? You see, that is also my quest.

457
01:38:46,739 --> 01:38:52,020
That guy's terrorized these villagers too long. I see you got the sword that deflects Red attacks.

458
01:38:52,739 --> 01:38:56,260
I'm not relying on any steel. My weapons are my fists.

459
01:38:57,060 --> 01:39:00,859
Just out of curiosity, would you like to engage in some friendly sparring?

460
01:39:00,859 --> 01:39:05,100
See which one of us is the strongest? Your sword versus my fists?

461
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:10,340
You want a surprising battle? All right, let's see who truly is the strongest.

462
01:39:10,340 --> 01:39:17,739
Fucking cringe. What? Why did I just cringe?

463
01:39:20,460 --> 01:39:58,260
Wait, why wasn't I ready? Shit, I could be hitting way more of these.

464
01:39:58,819 --> 01:40:16,979
Like that, there we go. Yeah, you gotta string it together.

465
01:40:16,979 --> 01:40:24,199
Cat, our streamer is bad. What? No, I'm not. I mean, I'm not great. I wouldn't say I'm very

466
01:40:24,199 --> 01:40:30,069
good, good, but I think I'm okay. You got impressive moves. I have to practice harder

467
01:40:30,069 --> 01:40:36,500
if I'm gonna beat the evil wizard before you. Let me handle it. I'm the one with the sword.

468
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:47,159
Oh no. Help me, Red. This game's too hard. I gotta attack my squirrels.

469
01:40:47,720 --> 01:40:53,779
Would you help me? Thanks much. This time I will not fail.

470
01:40:53,779 --> 01:41:05,779
Oh no, get up. Wow, those squirrels don't give up.

471
01:41:06,420 --> 01:41:11,300
Would you help me up again? Thanks. This time I will not fail.

472
01:41:17,130 --> 01:41:22,649
Wow, don't give up. Can I have you help me? Thanks. Thanks for helping me.

473
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:29,260
If he's dead, he's dead. Whatever.

474
01:41:29,899 --> 01:41:36,100
Dear enter my domain. I have been commanded to not let a soul pass this bridge

475
01:41:36,100 --> 01:41:42,119
if you are to cross. Prepare to pay with your life. Is this the wizard? No.

476
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:59,689
I think it's about to get serious. Boys and girls, it's about to get serious. What was that?

477
01:41:59,689 --> 01:42:11,619
What the fuck is this? Oh, it takes out the whole row. That's good. No.

478
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:55,289
I like the song though. It's really chill. Shit. See ya.

479
01:42:58,500 --> 01:43:05,289
Got some dank moves. Such great powers. I sure hope you're a good aligned character.

480
01:43:18,300 --> 01:43:23,899
Warrior had proven their skills twice. Their confidence was high, which would be needed.

481
01:43:23,899 --> 01:43:27,260
The swamp of chaos would challenge the warrior to their very core.

482
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:35,159
Swamp of chaos? Isn't a swamp level a bit cliche? What's next, the sewer level before the tower?

483
01:43:35,159 --> 01:43:45,420
No. It's actually the badlands of chaos. You don't have to change the entire level because

484
01:43:45,420 --> 01:43:49,739
of the zig. No, it's fine. I was obviously kidding that there was a swamp level. This is better.

485
01:43:51,180 --> 01:44:20,869
The game's like glitching. Do you see that? What's this? Can I get rid of this stuff?

486
01:44:21,430 --> 01:44:28,949
Honestly, the graphics in this level are very ugly. It really looks unfinished.

487
01:44:29,670 --> 01:44:43,239
Well, that's what you get. Just saying you can make it better at the end of the game.

488
01:44:43,239 --> 01:44:57,109
This is fart music. I gotta come forward in the chair. Here we go.

489
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:05,399
Stop hitting me. Only if you give me all your items.

490
01:45:06,199 --> 01:45:12,170
Land, is that you? Did you see ya? This is my custom made mech character from Gears of

491
01:45:13,050 --> 01:45:18,970
This fantasy game is way easier with a mech. I also noticed that attacking other players gives

492
01:45:18,970 --> 01:45:25,189
me more loot. This must be breaking several game rules. I'll have to check the rule book.

493
01:45:26,229 --> 01:45:28,789
Hold on, you don't play a good character, do you Red?

494
01:45:29,930 --> 01:45:49,180
Oh, in that case, green and over all of your items will feel the wrath of the chaos six.

495
01:45:49,180 --> 01:46:30,439
God, he's like scary looking. B. All right, get it together. Get it together. E.

496
01:46:43,739 --> 01:47:15,640
Fuck. I'm going too far. This game is hard. I play a good guy. I lose. I play a bad guy. I lose.

497
01:47:15,640 --> 01:47:23,939
Here we go. I found the rule about PvP combat. Oh, I guess you guys solved it already. It was

498
01:47:23,939 --> 01:47:34,229
really not what we were concerned about. The show must go on little one. How am I supposed to win

499
01:47:34,229 --> 01:47:40,149
when I keep losing? Muk keeps telling me failure is the progress that pays the world to success.

500
01:47:41,430 --> 01:47:47,739
To me, failure just seems like failure. I guess you just have to think of another way to win the

501
01:47:47,739 --> 01:47:55,859
game. I can't believe I was steamrolled by flan. I should really retire.

502
01:48:19,319 --> 01:48:25,579
Don't skip. I didn't skip anything. Finally, at the foot of the tower,

503
01:48:25,579 --> 01:48:31,289
the lair of the evil wizard. Will you be able to save the village from its ill fate?

504
01:48:31,289 --> 01:48:38,460
It's actually becoming quite exciting. You can do it, Red. I guess if anyone has a chance to win,

505
01:48:38,460 --> 01:48:53,699
it's you. If you defeat the evil wizard, we win the game. I'm the curse save point. There is a

506
01:48:53,699 --> 01:48:59,460
50% chance that I'll delete your save. Lucky for you, you should have several save slots.

507
01:48:59,460 --> 01:49:07,750
Do you take your chances? Oh my god. That actually scared me. Your save was deleted?

508
01:49:07,750 --> 01:49:15,560
Okay. Holy shit, is that real? But seriously, your game was saved. Okay.

509
01:49:15,560 --> 01:49:30,470
Scared me enough to do that. Got all this space back here. I'm assuming you're not going to use it?

510
01:49:31,350 --> 01:50:15,340
Really? Okay. You have come a long way, warrior. I see that you are armed.

511
01:50:16,220 --> 01:50:26,779
You are not the first they have sent to assassinate me. Isn't that right, Rasta beast?

512
01:50:26,779 --> 01:50:30,220
The villagers just fear what they don't understand, you see.

513
01:50:31,770 --> 01:50:36,569
Don't listen to that evil wizard, Red. Oh, shut up, Rasta. I don't have time for this

514
01:50:36,569 --> 01:50:42,010
and you heroes are bothering me. Your death will serve as an example for anyone that would

515
01:50:42,010 --> 01:50:54,039
even consider disturbing me. All right. This is the big one right here.

516
01:50:54,760 --> 01:51:59,369
Oh, they're being blocked. You think you're fighting evil? You are so full of yourself.

517
01:52:02,739 --> 01:52:27,239
I am the one who hears God. How are you so strong? I can't believe I was beaten by a wooden

518
01:52:27,239 --> 01:52:41,270
doll wearing a metal bucket. One day I'll have my revenge. Lots of jump scares in this game.

519
01:52:41,270 --> 01:52:44,470
Thank you for saving me, Red. I wouldn't have made it if it wasn't for you.

520
01:52:44,470 --> 01:52:52,899
You fought valiantly. Let's go back to the village and tell them the good news.

521
01:52:52,899 --> 01:53:03,960
You beat him too fast, you skipped verse two. Really? Oh, shit. Now that the quest has come

522
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:10,680
to an end, Red and Rasta beast journeyed back to the village, silhouetted by a glorious sunset.

523
01:53:14,279 --> 01:53:23,800
No verse two. Really? Oh, sorry. Once returned, they were received as heroes for defeating the

524
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:33,100
evil wizard. Plant opened up a bakery where they sold slimy muffins, which proved to be quite a

525
01:53:33,100 --> 01:53:42,840
success. Zig decided to make the tower their home, where Zig lived happily ever after,

526
01:53:42,840 --> 01:53:52,489
or at least for a long time. And Nosferatu- Wait, you weren't in the game at all? I wanted to role

527
01:53:52,489 --> 01:53:58,619
play as one of the mushrooms. Nosferatu continued the unfruitful quest of trying to learn the

528
01:53:58,619 --> 01:54:15,500
secrets of their past. The end. Oh, that was fun. So what did you guys think? That was a good session,

529
01:54:15,500 --> 01:54:22,359
green mage. Oh, I've played better. I enjoyed it, even if it was a bit hard. I guess this is it.

530
01:54:25,510 --> 01:54:40,779
Actually, your great efforts of saving the land of Medallion, Red. Puzzle piece. Take this tributary

531
01:54:40,779 --> 01:54:50,199
piece of wood as a reminder of this epic quest. Oh, wow. I'm sure it will come in handy. We picked

532
01:54:50,199 --> 01:55:03,909
up a piece of a door. Door piece. Very cool. Oh, it's open. Hey, what are you doing? That's private.

533
01:55:04,470 --> 01:55:16,140
The hatch is shut. You can't seem to get it open. What? Are you serious? For that just being one

534
01:55:16,140 --> 01:55:23,560
little section of this area? That was pretty crazy. That was one little house. There's so much

535
01:55:23,560 --> 01:55:40,470
more to do here. What's this? Oh, boy. I'm not doing that yet. Hi, dear. I feel that I am

536
01:55:40,470 --> 01:56:01,500
destined to do great things in my life. I can go down. Who's out there? If anyone is out there,

537
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:06,539
it's kind of an emergency. Could you get some toilet paper? I'll reward you with a lava lamp

538
01:56:06,539 --> 01:56:25,270
for your troubles. OK, toilet paper. What about the shop? These flowers smell like an old person's

539
01:56:25,270 --> 01:56:38,739
breath. Like Sour Patch Kids and cigarettes. A rigidly locked chest. I smell like childhood.

540
01:56:38,739 --> 01:56:52,840
I smell like barbecue. These flowers smell like paper. They smell like dirt. They smell like

541
01:56:52,840 --> 01:57:03,270
skunky sweet. Wow. What is that clay pot you have? It would fit perfectly for something I had in

542
01:57:03,270 --> 01:57:09,699
mind. I will give you something valuable in return. Could I have the clay pot? Yes.

543
01:57:13,689 --> 01:57:24,279
This feels great. You can take my old hat. Trash can live. You seem interested in that chest.

544
01:57:24,920 --> 01:57:29,720
Are you only Altem? Only the brown mage can unlock the golden lock, so I've heard.

545
01:57:34,520 --> 01:57:49,159
I got a lid. What do I do with the lid now? Hi, small figure. I'm a stone guardian. Really like

546
01:57:49,159 --> 01:57:58,220
eat, but I no move. Oh, you have food. Can I has cake? Yes. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum.

547
01:57:59,350 --> 01:58:06,939
Delch. This was a bad cake. Thanks for nothing. What? What do you mean?

548
01:58:07,659 --> 01:58:26,979
Pick up a hook. Do I have a hook? I have a trash can lid. A beautiful metal thing is that. I would

549
01:58:26,979 --> 01:58:33,689
love to trade it. What do you want? Do you want to trade? Yes. Wow. I look so cool. Here, take this.

550
01:58:34,090 --> 01:58:46,819
Um, this nice stick. I don't feel like it's a bad trade. Pick up a nice stick. Okay, stick,

551
01:58:46,819 --> 01:59:01,829
trash can lid. Is there a trash somewhere? Oh, right here. I need a roof for my home. Maybe I

552
01:59:01,829 --> 01:59:06,789
can give you some trash if you find me a roof. I do have some half used toilet paper if that would

553
01:59:06,789 --> 01:59:14,180
be useful. Hey, that thing right there would be great. Perfect. I will trade you for the toilet

554
01:59:14,180 --> 01:59:33,100
paper. Yes. Wait, you're not getting my toilet. I need it too. Haha. What? That's not fair. Ow,

555
01:59:33,100 --> 02:00:47,210
my hand. Damn it. Oh, cool. I like this one. Damn. I think you get your that end, huh? That end?

556
02:00:47,210 --> 02:00:54,310
Oh, what a bother. Fine. Take the toilet paper, but I'm keeping the roof. Got the toilet paper.

557
02:00:54,310 --> 02:01:04,390
I need to be honest. You're really good at this game. You're crazy good at this game. Am I?

558
02:01:04,949 --> 02:01:12,539
Can I find my calling? Who's out there? If anyone is out there, it's kind of an emergency. Yep,

559
02:01:12,539 --> 02:01:22,380
I got toilet paper. Attach it to the hook and I will hoist it up. So what? You're going to

560
02:01:22,380 --> 02:01:34,149
give me the key to the chest, right? Ah, yes. Finally, I can wipe my table clean. Is assholes

561
02:01:34,149 --> 02:01:44,439
a table? Oh, right. I promised you something. A lava lamp, right? Oh, no, I've got bad news.

562
02:01:44,439 --> 02:01:51,909
I seem to have lost it. If you bring me batteries, I promise to make something really, really unique

563
02:01:51,909 --> 02:02:06,090
and special as a super promise. You dick. Bring me batteries. Well, batteries. Batteries in the

564
02:02:06,090 --> 02:02:26,859
clock. I think I went everywhere I can here, right? I think that's it. Hold on. Wait, hold on.

565
02:02:26,859 --> 02:02:40,229
Oh, the door is locked. What is that? All right. Well, I know I can go down. I can do it, Red.

566
02:02:40,229 --> 02:02:50,869
My wife is 350 pounds. Please help me. I don't know. What do you want me to do about it? What

567
02:02:50,869 --> 02:03:04,279
do you want me to do about it, man? Good luck with whatever you're doing. Okay. So I got that

568
02:03:04,279 --> 02:03:13,130
was that door. We've been here. We've been here. Have I been? This is okay. We've been here. This

569
02:03:13,130 --> 02:03:20,979
is the entrance, right? No, I don't want to leave yet. We've not gone in here. I hope you had a

570
02:03:20,979 --> 02:03:38,069
great time. Want to go back dancing? Wait, what? I've gone in here. Knock on in here. How much do

571
02:03:38,069 --> 02:03:48,869
I weigh? 100 and like 150 160. I just want to be someone. I wish I could leave this place someday.

572
02:03:48,869 --> 02:04:07,909
I haven't felt happy in such a long time. 155. Um, I guess I can't do anything here.

573
02:04:14,600 --> 02:04:43,189
Okay. What was that all about? Uh, you should do a golfing stream. I'm not gonna go golf. No,

574
02:04:43,189 --> 02:04:50,699
I don't. I'm bad. I can drive, but I can't do anything else. I can drive and I can putt. That's

575
02:04:50,699 --> 02:04:58,779
it. I would love to drive your ball for you. Wait till you chip it a million times and all the annoying

576
02:04:58,779 --> 02:05:04,710
boring shit. So like I do the, I use the driver and I smash it. And then I just go in the golf

577
02:05:04,710 --> 02:05:09,109
card and get to the green. I just drive to the green and wait for you. And you do all the shitty

578
02:05:09,109 --> 02:05:15,590
boring golf suck stuff from the tee to the green. And then I take the putter and I putt. I do the

579
02:05:15,590 --> 02:05:26,550
fun stuff. Just tell gold pig that you beat me up. If I can count on you saying the same. Yes.

580
02:05:26,550 --> 02:05:31,960
You're a cool guy. All right. I've been, this is the first part, right? I was already here.

581
02:05:31,960 --> 02:05:40,970
I remember doing this and I spit in the, like the one hour that I played this game a couple

582
02:05:40,970 --> 02:05:50,409
weeks ago. I remember playing that part. This implies that I would let myself be within 200 feet

583
02:05:50,409 --> 02:05:59,109
of you. I don't understand. What do you, what do you think? What do you think I'm going to do?

584
02:05:59,670 --> 02:06:18,659
Like start biting you? Door's locked. Did I go in here? I think I already did. Yeah, didn't I?

585
02:06:19,220 --> 02:06:24,680
This door seems broken. Oh, I have all the pieces to this door. All right. Let me save it.

586
02:06:24,680 --> 02:06:32,739
He's rabid. I'm not gonna, why do people think that I'm going to like, I'm going to see you

587
02:06:33,380 --> 02:06:38,970
first of all, how am I going to know who you are? If we're just like out in public somewhere and

588
02:06:38,970 --> 02:06:43,449
we're just doing something, I'm going to know that you're a chatter in my chat. I'm, dude,

589
02:06:43,449 --> 02:06:47,460
if we're just at the grocery store, we're at the grocery store. I'm not going to like ask everybody

590
02:06:47,460 --> 02:06:51,619
in the grocery store if they're a watcher of the channel. First of all, how are you, how am I going

591
02:06:51,619 --> 02:07:08,489
to know who you are from the smell? Okay. Are you sure you want to go in this door?

592
02:07:09,050 --> 02:07:12,649
This journey is long and unforgiving. Do you still want to enter? Yes, of course I do.

593
02:07:17,739 --> 02:07:42,979
And what, like, oh, hey, Jerma. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, just want to say. What, what is it?

594
02:07:45,140 --> 02:07:51,539
I'm a big fan. And when I hear the N in fan, I just grab your fucking arm and start.

595
02:07:55,159 --> 02:08:07,960
Why do you think that's going to happen? No, here's what's going to happen. Hey, Jerma.

596
02:08:11,699 --> 02:08:15,699
Hey, I'm a big fan. Oh, hey, cool, man. Really good to see you.

597
02:08:16,520 --> 02:08:22,579
You're a fan. That's awesome. That's so cool. Yeah, I, this is really fun. This is really cool.

598
02:08:22,579 --> 02:08:27,529
I can't believe somebody recognized me in public. That's insane. Yeah, dude, can I get a selfie?

599
02:08:27,529 --> 02:08:33,539
Of course you can. Of course you can. I'm going to need your credit card, though. And I got my

600
02:08:33,539 --> 02:08:43,859
app here. It has tap. You can tap the phone. It's a little device I plug in. Yeah, sure,

601
02:08:43,859 --> 02:09:02,649
absolutely. You got like a chip in your card, right? Yeah. And then he bites you after you pay.

602
02:09:03,369 --> 02:09:12,329
No. Oh my God. Oh, thanks, man. Yeah, that was $50. Oh, here's a selfie.

603
02:09:21,479 --> 02:09:26,199
I'm just a normal person, guys. I'm not like a rabid weirdo. If you come up to me and say,

604
02:09:26,199 --> 02:09:29,479
Hey dude, how are you? I'm going to be like, Hey, what's up? It's really good to see you.

605
02:09:30,119 --> 02:09:37,220
I'm not like a psycho. I'm not going to like, what are you talking about? Hey, red and blue.

606
02:09:37,220 --> 02:09:40,579
The night is here. Sit down and relax. You still have a long walk ahead.

607
02:09:50,310 --> 02:10:00,659
Please don't bite me. I don't want to turn into a germa. I've been meaning to tell you red.

608
02:10:01,380 --> 02:10:06,020
This path will only lead to more torment. You have come this far. So I guess you've made up

609
02:10:06,020 --> 02:10:12,140
your mind. I'm afraid this will lead to more questions than answers. I fear something

610
02:10:12,140 --> 02:10:18,890
horrible might happen if you continue. Anyway, much has been said. It's time to hit the hay.

611
02:10:19,529 --> 02:10:33,850
Good night. Is it like a bite of a vampire or a zombie? Um, I don't know. Probably,

612
02:10:34,409 --> 02:10:40,619
probably a zombie. If I were to say that I don't have fangs and I don't like drink blood or

613
02:10:40,619 --> 02:10:46,920
anything. So a zombie is just kind of a person's mouth and it's just kind of dirty with unbrushed

614
02:10:46,920 --> 02:10:57,529
teeth. I mean, right? That's the only difference. A bit embarrassing. I don't remember why we are

615
02:10:57,529 --> 02:11:08,890
here. What are we actually trying to do? I don't understand what we are doing. I feel like everyone

616
02:11:08,890 --> 02:11:14,100
is speaking in riddles. There's no clear indication to what's actually going on. You really think we

617
02:11:14,100 --> 02:11:22,460
should continue forward? I trust you. What is going on with this fire? Somebody's just breaking

618
02:11:22,460 --> 02:11:26,380
styrofoam in the background. I can't even concentrate. I just hope you know what you're

619
02:11:26,380 --> 02:11:46,949
doing. I just wanted to say that I trust you. Good night. Tap dancing. Yeah, somebody's practicing

620
02:11:46,949 --> 02:12:05,689
above me in my apartment. That's not what fire sounds like. As good as a day can be, the road

621
02:12:05,689 --> 02:12:14,810
is clear. Good luck. That's the hamburger helper burning in the oven. You don't put a hamburger

622
02:12:14,890 --> 02:12:34,520
helper in the oven. In the oven. It's the sap that's being ignited by the wood.

623
02:12:37,800 --> 02:12:42,409
All right. That's actually kind of interesting. I actually didn't know that. That's kind of cool.

624
02:12:43,050 --> 02:13:05,220
Thanks for the tip. This is nice. This kind of reminds me of Outer Wilds at one planet. Enough,

625
02:13:05,220 --> 02:13:12,619
buddy. Look, pal. I tried stopping you earlier, but you ignored it. I laughed and let it slide,

626
02:13:12,619 --> 02:13:19,260
but now I've really got to put my foot down and tell you, go back and stay out and I won't hurt

627
02:13:19,260 --> 02:13:34,710
you. Oh, I see. So be it. Get ready for a beating, fella. You gonna distract my lightning? I'm

628
02:13:34,710 --> 02:13:44,460
serious. Go back. Come on, mate. What are you gonna be so stubborn? If you won't turn back,

629
02:13:44,460 --> 02:13:55,909
I'll be forced to take you down. All right. You asked for it. I hate to do it. I'm gonna be real

630
02:13:55,909 --> 02:14:01,380
sorry. I shall unleash my fury upon you like the thunder of a thousand lightning storms.

631
02:14:01,380 --> 02:14:16,039
We got a big one coming up. A good song. What am I doing? Why would this work the second time?

632
02:14:16,039 --> 02:14:24,119
All right. Hear me out. If Gold Pig asks, please just say that I fought valiantly, displayed great

633
02:14:24,119 --> 02:14:33,289
acts of heroism and all that jazz. I won't waste any more of your time. I will. Don't worry. I will.

634
02:14:40,310 --> 02:14:50,069
What's that? A car?

635
02:15:02,920 --> 02:15:11,130
Hello? Broken car. There are batteries next to the engine. Do you want to pick up the- Yes, I do.

636
02:15:13,210 --> 02:15:40,489
You picked up the batteries. He's mad. What's the car battle? Go back, turn around. I'm not going

637
02:15:40,489 --> 02:15:45,930
all the way back that way. That's a 10 minute walk. I'm gonna get teleported to that hub world

638
02:15:45,930 --> 02:16:19,640
anyways. Big gate stands ahead. Do you want to open the gate? Yes. What do we got? Oh, you walk

639
02:16:19,640 --> 02:16:23,319
the entire way to the old desert temple and not many visitors come to these parts. It's good to

640
02:16:23,319 --> 02:16:32,010
have multiple saves. Who knows what might happen? Nice. Good luck with whatever you're doing.

641
02:16:38,020 --> 02:16:45,860
Look who finally stumbled in. You just won't give up. As much as I do. I must say I do.

642
02:16:45,860 --> 02:16:54,260
Admiring. Chasing. Like this. At the edge of the mountain. Lucky for you, I have prepared a

643
02:16:54,260 --> 02:17:08,489
welcoming party. Perfect. What I do. What I pay you to do. Hello, Red. I cannot let you continue down

644
02:17:08,489 --> 02:17:21,819
this path. Leave now. I will kill you if you don't. I'm not a very good actor. I'm not a good actor.

645
02:17:32,649 --> 02:17:35,610
Seems that you didn't understand what I meant when I told you to leave.

646
02:17:36,569 --> 02:17:50,809
I regret disobeying my command. This is a Zumbini. I feel pain. I've resurrected you from the dead.

647
02:17:51,690 --> 02:17:59,000
You are to follow my orders until I release you. What is it you ask of me? I want you to disable

648
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:13,500
the red one. I have something funny to- can't write as well. All right, let's get down to business.

649
02:18:14,219 --> 02:18:20,299
You want to pass, Dolly? That ain't happening. Amigo, you heard what either mage said. I'ma

650
02:18:20,299 --> 02:19:02,040
mess you up. Real bad. Can I still have the sword? Who made all the music for this? That's awesome.

651
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:56,250
It was Kevin MacLeod. It was not Kevin MacLeod. It's not Kevin MacLeod. It was. No, it was not

652
02:19:56,250 --> 02:20:02,649
Kevin MacLeod. I'm guaranteeing that. Kevin MacLeod is a talented guy. He made a bunch of

653
02:20:02,649 --> 02:20:10,059
great songs for all of us YouTubers. I don't think they had anything to do with this. It's

654
02:20:10,059 --> 02:20:20,899
impossible. Purple, I can't do it. Yes, I see. I did not expect you to be victorious. I expected

655
02:20:20,899 --> 02:20:29,049
you to die. I can't believe I was being used like that. This isn't the first time Purple put me in

656
02:20:29,049 --> 02:20:37,909
a rotting corpse. I could at least have been for something important. Those mages, I don't like

657
02:20:37,909 --> 02:21:02,059
them. I don't like them. I know your secret now. The tactic that lets you win. I found you.

658
02:21:03,260 --> 02:21:08,940
I am Rob, former world champion. Raised from the dead. How to fulfill my deed with my bro Zomp.

659
02:21:09,739 --> 02:21:15,340
But where is that guy? Ah, your green zombie friend there, down the hall.

660
02:21:16,219 --> 02:21:21,899
Oh snap, that slacker knows we've got a job to do. Whoa, whoa, wait. Hold on there. I recognize

661
02:21:21,899 --> 02:21:29,020
your voice. You're the one that summoned me. Oh, I see. You're part of the binding contract.

662
02:21:29,979 --> 02:21:36,540
Seems I've summoned two entities, I guess. Sure seems like it, bro. This guy is loud.

663
02:21:37,260 --> 02:21:45,670
What do you want me to do, boss? Well, since you're here. Yeah. If you defeat it, I will release you

664
02:21:45,670 --> 02:21:52,649
from your bind. Okay, bro. It'll be a piece of cake. Hey, you're going to, yeah, I'm gonna, yeah.

665
02:21:56,409 --> 02:22:02,729
Who's louder, me or them? It's definitely me. It's definitely me. I'm way fucking louder than

666
02:22:02,729 --> 02:22:46,680
this guy. It's not me. It's not me. Holy shit. Oh God, it's distracting. You play good. No,

667
02:22:47,479 --> 02:22:52,920
not sure I could take them down, bro. I didn't expect you to. I expected you to die.

668
02:22:53,719 --> 02:23:03,540
Nothing has changed, Red. Hey, it's me again. I thought I would make things easier for you.

669
02:23:03,540 --> 02:23:11,850
It's good to have multiple saves. Who knows what might happen? Do you want to save? Yes.

670
02:23:15,530 --> 02:23:23,590
Nice. Good luck with whatever you're doing. All right. All right. All right. Okay. I don't,

671
02:23:23,590 --> 02:23:34,969
whatever. Just look up on like the Wikipedia for this game what he said. Dude, my, hey,

672
02:23:34,969 --> 02:23:39,049
my wife is 400 pounds. I don't care how heavy your wife is. I don't care how heavy you are.

673
02:23:39,049 --> 02:23:45,690
I don't care. You're just prancing around in the same spot. I'm surprised you even got this far.

674
02:23:46,649 --> 02:23:50,969
The dead may not be able to stop you. Living seem unable to do as well.

675
02:23:54,620 --> 02:24:08,500
But I will not let you continue. We'll end your journey. This probably seems like a major boss

676
02:24:08,500 --> 02:25:58,170
fighter. Oh boy. I can't get hit there. Why don't they play this kind of shit at the club? I would

677
02:25:58,170 --> 02:26:27,959
go. It's getting quieter. This is freaking me out. They do. They do. They do this in Germany.

678
02:26:29,100 --> 02:26:38,680
It's true. Hold on. Do I find that I like a certain genre of like German club music and I didn't even

679
02:26:38,680 --> 02:26:48,739
know? Impressive. I won't be able to stop you. Understand that I did what I had to do. Let your

680
02:26:48,739 --> 02:26:57,299
choices be merciful. It's literally just EDM. But is it like German EDM or is there a difference?

681
02:26:57,299 --> 02:27:33,500
It's just standard. It's techno. You missed a door? I didn't. Oh, there is a door right here.

682
02:27:34,139 --> 02:27:50,299
You're right. What kind of music do you hear at clubs? I don't know. What's this?

683
02:27:51,500 --> 02:27:54,620
It's been a long time since we arrived in what some call Everhood.

684
02:27:55,659 --> 02:28:00,219
So many years have passed that I've almost forgotten some of us were once humans.

685
02:28:00,219 --> 02:28:05,590
So I thought I would write our history before time fades away. Time fades away our memories.

686
02:28:06,790 --> 02:28:13,260
A long time ago, before we found the rift that would enable us to transport to this realm of

687
02:28:13,260 --> 02:28:20,040
the immortals. When we were a society of millions and a small selection of us had the privilege to

688
02:28:20,040 --> 02:28:25,639
belong to the almost at intestines, we had many debates on how to share this gift, this newfound

689
02:28:25,639 --> 02:28:33,639
miracle. Should we open it for everyone or should only a few be allowed to visit such a place?

690
02:28:34,360 --> 02:28:39,770
We decided it had been far too long that we had kept this gift to ourselves. In the end,

691
02:28:39,770 --> 02:28:47,379
we determined we should allow everyone to meet the entities. The masses were elated. A great

692
02:28:47,379 --> 02:28:52,329
majority decided to become immortals while only a few would remain as mortals, such as the old,

693
02:28:52,329 --> 02:28:59,059
the sick, and unfortunate ones were the reasons of their own. You could experience the most

694
02:28:59,059 --> 02:29:04,569
euphoric moments of your life then completely forgot they ever had happened over and over again.

695
02:29:04,569 --> 02:29:10,180
I still have fond memories of using the earthquake machine during my dance-off battles with pink

696
02:29:10,180 --> 02:29:36,149
mage. They were one of a kind and I truly miss them. Brown Mage. Okay, are we in the metaverse?

697
02:29:42,940 --> 02:29:52,200
Go back, go to talk to Brown Mage. Can I get there from here? I don't think I can get all

698
02:29:52,200 --> 02:30:08,500
the way back there. No, I know. I'm not listening to that one guy. This game's sick. This is a really

699
02:30:08,500 --> 02:30:14,540
good game. I understand why everybody wanted me to finish it. It's very, very good. Very fun.

700
02:30:14,540 --> 02:30:25,510
You need to do the Schrodinger's stream. What's Schrodinger's stream?

701
02:30:35,049 --> 02:30:39,930
You're unbeatable after all. I assume now you feel entitled to have your arm.

702
02:30:40,729 --> 02:30:45,590
I won't let you take it. That's why. You're going to have to take it for my cold,

703
02:30:45,590 --> 02:31:21,209
dead hands. I will end you. Let's go. Final boss. Maybe. Watch it.

704
02:31:26,389 --> 02:31:29,670
Easy. Get your tits out of the way, I can't see. You're blocking my view.

705
02:31:59,020 --> 02:32:48,069
Through the fog. Why did I walk into that? You gotta keep the blood flowing. See what I mean?

706
02:33:01,530 --> 02:33:47,739
Whoa. How do I dodge that? Oh. All right. Fight him. Shoot him. That's not it. I'm prepared.

707
02:33:55,190 --> 02:33:57,270
Typical of you to dodge my attacks.

708
02:34:00,069 --> 02:34:05,340
Why do you keep challenging Red when you know you always lose, Gold Pig? What do you mean?

709
02:34:06,459 --> 02:34:11,540
Don't tell me you've forgotten. Seems you don't remember Red's other side, Blue.

710
02:34:11,940 --> 02:34:21,100
Oh, always being a pawn in someone else's scheme, little gnome.

711
02:34:22,139 --> 02:34:28,940
Gold has been using you all along to get his arm back. Wait, what? I, what?

712
02:34:29,819 --> 02:34:36,219
Didn't know, or? Forgot. You scattle-brained twerp. I noticed you kept forgetting things.

713
02:34:37,579 --> 02:34:40,780
It was just a matter of time before you turned completely useless.

714
02:34:41,899 --> 02:34:45,340
That's why I took your legs. You don't need those.

715
02:34:46,600 --> 02:34:58,440
My legs? You stole my legs? You stole Blue's legs? You let your greed control your actions again,

716
02:34:58,440 --> 02:35:05,129
Gold Pig? Why would you even take Blue's legs? That's why they may be useful as toothpicks.

717
02:35:05,770 --> 02:35:10,809
You give me my toothpicks back. Give me my legs. Give me back my legs.

718
02:35:12,649 --> 02:35:17,209
You should return the legs. Blue is weak. They don't deserve to have anything.

719
02:35:18,760 --> 02:35:33,659
Give back the legs, you hoarder. Fine. Fine. So I'm Red Mage, and that's Blue Mage,

720
02:35:33,659 --> 02:35:37,819
and that's Green Mage, and that's Purple Mage. So we're all like, we all know each other.

721
02:35:37,819 --> 02:35:50,200
We're all friends. Oh, I can finally walk again. I guess I don't need your help anymore.

722
02:35:51,319 --> 02:36:00,549
Thanks for helping me. Now, where's Red's arm? I think you'd better spill the beans, Gold Pig.

723
02:36:01,190 --> 02:36:06,969
These guys don't give up. Do what you want, right? Your precious little arm.

724
02:36:08,569 --> 02:36:16,649
It is no use to try and hide it any longer. I keep it in the treasury. Go and get it and then buzz

725
02:36:16,649 --> 02:36:36,379
off. It's gonna be a trap. They're gonna lock me in like a cell. I know it. There's a trap. It has

726
02:36:36,379 --> 02:36:55,940
to be. Oh, look it. These are all our friends. We know these are all the friends we've made along

727
02:36:55,940 --> 02:37:03,530
the way here. Remember the door? Remember the fish? Remember the goblin? Remember Dr. Robotnik?

728
02:37:03,530 --> 02:37:11,540
Make a second save. Multiple saves. Hurry. Save. Save. Two saves. What? What? Why? Make a new save.

729
02:37:11,540 --> 02:37:30,889
Why am I making a new save? Okay. Make a third save. I'm not doing two. I'm not. I'm doing two

730
02:37:30,889 --> 02:37:51,110
saves. I'm not. I don't. No. Here's my arm. You want to pick up the arm. Leave you scram. Don't.

731
02:37:51,110 --> 02:37:55,860
Are you sure? Yes. You picked up your arm.

732
02:38:11,180 --> 02:38:28,010
What? It's not. This is bullshit. This is a fake end. Yeah, it's a fake ending. It's a fake ending.

733
02:38:28,969 --> 02:38:46,409
I can smell it from a mile away. It's a fake ending. It seems as if the doll has finally

734
02:38:46,409 --> 02:38:53,129
found its arm. You have proven yourself more than worthy to get your arm back.

735
02:38:54,200 --> 02:39:01,639
Now that you have seen what remains of this world, the ones in this world are trapped here in this

736
02:39:01,639 --> 02:39:12,420
realm. They have lived for many, many, many, many eons. Searching for a release for a purpose,

737
02:39:12,420 --> 02:39:19,750
for a meaning. I just freaked out. People said their voice is bad. I must ask of you a huge

738
02:39:19,750 --> 02:39:27,059
favor. Help free us from this eternal wandering. You must find extraordinary courage and determination

739
02:39:27,059 --> 02:39:37,510
as this will be an immense challenge to end this world. We'll show you how to free souls with your

740
02:39:37,510 --> 02:39:51,510
arm. Pair yourself. Human. Oh, this is a real boss. Oh, we got to lock in on this one. Listen

741
02:39:51,510 --> 02:40:23,399
closely now. Reflect my attacks. Whoa. This is a whole new game. It's loud. So you got to get three

742
02:40:23,399 --> 02:41:04,760
notes of the same color in a row. Shit. Oh, this makes it harder. This makes it really hard. You

743
02:41:04,760 --> 02:41:16,020
just need two notes of the same color and now free souls. It's only two notes. Two then X to fire.

744
02:41:16,020 --> 02:41:20,659
Oh shit. Okay. I thought I had to. All right. It'll be a challenging mission, but you do not stand

745
02:41:20,659 --> 02:41:26,090
alone. You're the key, our champion, to free us from the shackles of immortality. Seek out the

746
02:41:26,090 --> 02:41:51,799
spirits if you are in doubt. All right. Go. Am I about to go free these motherfuckers over here?

747
02:41:51,799 --> 02:42:05,590
Interact or kill? What? You want to? Yeah. I want to save. What? Why would I kill the save point?

748
02:42:05,590 --> 02:42:15,639
Great. Good luck. What if I, what if I kill this? What happens? I understand. Oh,

749
02:42:16,600 --> 02:42:39,110
did I free them? Finally, you have your arm back. It's been such a long time. The mages have fled

750
02:42:39,110 --> 02:42:44,840
for they know what is coming, but they don't understand why they must be killed. You must

751
02:42:44,840 --> 02:42:50,229
help them by ending them. If you need help finding the remaining souls, we will be in our court.

752
02:42:50,229 --> 02:43:04,950
Right now. So they're all running from me now. I'm going to head back to the cosmic hub. Wait,

753
02:43:04,950 --> 02:43:24,809
I'm about to go on. I'm about to go kill everybody. I'm going to. Oh no. Don't kill the hub save point

754
02:43:24,809 --> 02:43:30,170
for obvious reasons. All right. Well, let me go to like the circus, the carnival.

755
02:43:30,170 --> 02:43:50,649
So wait a minute. What do you want to do? What's the point of learning new skills?

756
02:43:51,209 --> 02:44:00,040
What do I, what do I do? Hey, what's with the attitude? What are you doing?

757
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:08,250
I thought we were going to have a dance off. I thought we were going to have a dance off.

758
02:44:08,250 --> 02:44:12,889
I thought we were going to have like a dance off party thing. I don't want to kill everybody.

759
02:44:12,889 --> 02:44:20,739
I thought it was like, oh, I can like grab the different colors and should fire it back.

760
02:44:20,739 --> 02:44:32,379
What? I can just kill people? Hi there red. The cart race is closed. You, I have to?

761
02:44:32,379 --> 02:44:41,829
I didn't want to kill that person. It's releasing them. You're freeing them.

762
02:44:45,780 --> 02:44:56,069
I'm to stamp home. Goodbye. This feels bad. They're immortal. There's 28 more people. Wait,

763
02:44:56,069 --> 02:45:13,239
I have to wipe everybody out? You can go pacifist if you want. I mean, what do I do?

764
02:45:14,360 --> 02:45:19,000
Let's see what kind of wood you're made of. Oh shit. I can't just kill this guy. This guy's

765
02:45:19,000 --> 02:46:06,579
fighting back. Of course. Right. When I changed from yellow to gray, can I just tap, tap, tap,

766
02:46:07,620 --> 02:46:29,190
I'm going to try it. Watch this. Ready? You ready? Ready? Nope. That didn't work. I didn't do

767
02:46:29,190 --> 02:47:15,959
anything. Wait, wait, I didn't kill them. Oh, not so easy to kill a vampire. Is it? Oh, I got it.

768
02:47:15,959 --> 02:47:22,489
All right. I got you. It's, you got to do it before the song ends. This is awesome.

769
02:47:23,450 --> 02:47:52,260
This game just got like five times cooler. Right now. It just did. Shit, you idiot. You idiot.

770
02:47:55,110 --> 02:48:45,700
Can I block these? Oh, I can. I can. I didn't think I could block those.

771
02:48:46,819 --> 02:49:23,290
You fucking idiot. Stop blocking. Get out of here. Oh, you hit hard for looking like a pair of sticks.

772
02:49:24,010 --> 02:49:35,940
Before I go, let the world know. The world know what? I, Disco Jimmy, live to the fullest.

773
02:49:36,579 --> 02:49:56,969
Time for me to perform my final disappearing act. Hey, no need to be so hostile. Let me just

774
02:49:56,969 --> 02:50:04,739
go get a thing. What's he doing? Sucker. Wait, what? Is he hiding?

775
02:50:12,170 --> 02:50:21,540
You don't have to kill them all. There are two routes you locked yourself after murdering the

776
02:50:21,540 --> 02:50:26,180
save point. Oh shit. If you want to see this ending, you can keep going, but if you want to

777
02:50:26,180 --> 02:50:32,540
change your mind, you can slow the save before you kill the lamp post. Shit. Well, we're already

778
02:50:32,540 --> 02:50:39,340
doing this one. I'll do this one. I figured it was probably I didn't have to kill everybody,

779
02:50:40,139 --> 02:51:03,719
but I mean, I want to see what happens. How do I get out of here? Oh wait, there's a sign in there.

780
02:51:03,719 --> 02:51:17,159
Oh, there is a sign. You're right. I have to kill everything? Sign? Use magic eight ball. It will

781
02:51:17,159 --> 02:51:24,760
help in your mission. What is your obsession with me? You are so cool for vandalizing a sign.

782
02:51:25,479 --> 02:51:37,100
True rebel. 26. But what about the robot? The robot hid behind the booth.

783
02:51:41,110 --> 02:51:58,149
I didn't I didn't kill the robot. Let me see. There's actually four endings. That's actually

784
02:51:58,149 --> 02:52:14,549
that's cool. You stand still. The game will give you a guide and who you have to kill. Really?

785
02:52:14,549 --> 02:52:37,299
Oh, it's a lie. Okay. Do the right thing and save them. Wait, that means I have to kill all the

786
02:52:37,299 --> 02:52:45,399
mushrooms. I like the I like the mushrooms, but I'm not killing them. I'm freeing them from the

787
02:52:45,399 --> 02:52:51,860
immortal world where we're all stuck here. Right? Is that just the narrative I'm putting in my head?

788
02:52:51,860 --> 02:53:28,549
I kill this thing? Look, everyone's having a good time here. What about you? Can I? I'm the guardian

789
02:53:28,549 --> 02:53:33,370
of the mushroom forest. Oh, yes. Here it is. The reaper of souls. I've been looking forward

790
02:53:33,370 --> 02:53:38,860
to speaking with you. Have you come for my guidance or for my soul? Let me I'll get you.

791
02:53:38,860 --> 02:53:44,889
You can say some words first. Put it simply. Life is suffering. The living fear death until

792
02:53:44,889 --> 02:53:50,500
it's too late. That is how the mind works. But when life does not have a time span,

793
02:53:50,500 --> 02:53:57,620
becoming immortal is more of a curse than a blessing. It is torture for the soul. There's

794
02:53:57,620 --> 02:54:03,059
nothing to do with all of this time. After thousands of years, you become docile. You

795
02:54:03,059 --> 02:54:08,899
become mute. There are so few things you can do in a physical form. It's almost like a cruel joke.

796
02:54:09,620 --> 02:54:14,579
You must take great strides to realize what must be done. Do you understand what I'm what I'm saying?

797
02:54:15,139 --> 02:54:25,780
Do you understand that I want to die? Um, yes. Good. Good. Do you have what it takes to finish

798
02:54:25,780 --> 02:54:35,459
the quest? I don't know. Like maybe. No. Yes. The weight of the world is in your shoulders.

799
02:54:35,459 --> 02:54:39,780
No one should be forced to bear such a burden. You're the only one that can end this torture.

800
02:54:40,659 --> 02:55:02,540
Now, shall we battle? Yeah. Sure. Yes. Just like that.

801
02:55:02,540 --> 02:56:35,129
That was tricky. Well done. You performed admirably. A true liberator, finally.

802
02:56:35,850 --> 02:56:40,819
You will be received as a true champion when you reach the end. Farewell.

803
02:56:46,659 --> 02:56:52,950
Everybody around here see that? They kind of look, they look kind of sad. Are you all right?

804
02:56:53,430 --> 02:57:03,829
Wow. You found all of us. Oh, what a twist that you would be the one who had such power.

805
02:57:03,829 --> 02:57:16,620
Life sure is full of surprises. So long for now. I don't want to get rid of them all. I like these

806
02:57:16,620 --> 02:57:27,059
guys. I like this guy. I like this guy the most. I don't want to get rid of them. You found us. Yay.

807
02:57:28,340 --> 02:57:41,879
It comes a time for us all. Oh, you have to free them. They're suffering. Death is temporary.

808
02:57:42,760 --> 02:58:00,969
Life is eternal. There's nothing to be afraid of. Oh, God. He looks concerned. I don't think he...

809
02:58:05,750 --> 02:58:27,129
Nothing to be afraid of. Don't miss the point of the whole thing. This is a musical thing.

810
02:58:27,129 --> 02:58:29,209
We are supposed to dance, sing, and enjoy ourselves.

811
02:58:30,969 --> 02:58:44,059
Hi. Hey, little guy. What are you doing? Nothing. Just coming over to say hi to you and check on

812
02:58:44,059 --> 02:58:52,760
you and make sure you're doing okay. I'm doing good. I'm doing very good. Are you struggling?

813
02:58:52,760 --> 02:59:09,209
Are you sure of your actions? You can't kill me in a way that matters. What the fuck, man?

814
02:59:09,209 --> 02:59:20,170
It's not my... I'm freeing them from the immortal torture. Wait, the little worm guy. Get her alive.

815
02:59:20,170 --> 02:59:25,620
For me, it doesn't matter. I can let you kill me without a battle. Or would you prefer a fight?

816
02:59:25,620 --> 02:59:41,270
Do you want to battle? Yeah, I do. You're slaughtering everybody one by one.

817
02:59:42,760 --> 03:01:03,270
Well, oh yeah. This guy does the weird shit. Shit. Hello, human. Oh, he won. No, he didn't.

818
03:01:03,909 --> 03:01:30,629
I have green right now. Why is Dreamer so cracked at this game? I don't know. I just...

819
03:01:30,629 --> 03:01:40,579
I told you. Give me four buttons and I win. That was fun. I admit defeat.

820
03:01:41,780 --> 03:01:50,500
See you on the other side. Are you still on hard mode? Yeah. I haven't changed the difficulty or

821
03:01:50,500 --> 03:01:59,850
anything. I have no idea what extreme would be like. All right. Is anybody still here?

822
03:02:00,409 --> 03:02:19,860
Or did I free everybody? Is this somebody? The tree has a face. It said,

823
03:02:19,860 --> 03:02:32,979
I think your brain might be just wired to be funky. The people in the lab. Oh, that's right.

824
03:02:32,979 --> 03:02:54,040
Where was the lab? Isn't it up here? If you crank it up to extreme, it should be fine. It's not that

825
03:02:54,040 --> 03:03:02,520
much harder, to be honest. Maybe... Once I learned you got your arm back, I reconfigured this entire

826
03:03:02,520 --> 03:03:08,459
lab into an impenetrable death fortress. You're never going to catch me, bloodthirsty marauder.

827
03:03:08,459 --> 03:03:26,520
Run down. Make sure to set all traps to full power. All right, you doofus. Oh,

828
03:03:42,659 --> 03:04:13,959
just got to do it to the beat. That's it. No. Did you just turn it down? You fucked up. All right.

829
03:04:13,959 --> 03:04:16,760
I'll turn it back up. It looked like it was too loud. I'm sorry. I'll turn it back up.

830
03:04:42,489 --> 03:05:04,739
I'm fine. I need to go this way. I need to go over. I need to double. Where is it?

831
03:05:05,299 --> 03:05:15,299
Yes! I'm fine. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

832
03:05:17,399 --> 03:05:21,000
I have to turn it down in my head. Oh, I have to do the whole thing again. God damn it.

833
03:05:22,040 --> 03:05:49,559
God, I hate this. I just want to skip it. I hate trap stuff. I have no patience. This is getting

834
03:05:49,559 --> 03:05:57,940
murdered. I don't... I don't... I can't do it. I'm going right down the middle. One, two, three, go.

835
03:05:58,899 --> 03:06:22,180
I hate it. Okay, so I have to wait till it processes each other. One, two, go. My God,

836
03:06:22,180 --> 03:06:26,819
don't even do this to me. All right, so I have to start at the bottom. Just walk with it. Just walk

837
03:06:26,819 --> 03:06:45,079
with it. Just walk with it. All right, I made it. Oh, shit. What does this mean? Can I touch these?

838
03:06:48,819 --> 03:07:04,309
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. I'm fine. I can't believe it. How is it possible that you

839
03:07:04,309 --> 03:07:18,899
got through all those traps? I command you to attack that red marauder. All right, we're ready

840
03:07:18,899 --> 03:08:36,520
to kill. Oh, come on. God damn it. Come on. More volume. But that's a soul, right? 25. All right,

841
03:08:36,520 --> 03:08:59,059
don't move. I'm just going to save the game. Go to extreme difficulty. I don't think I can... Can I?

842
03:08:59,059 --> 03:09:04,520
Makes winning feel good, you will die. Less health regeneration for people who like hard challenges.

843
03:09:04,520 --> 03:09:11,079
You think I can handle it? I'll try it this once. If I can't do it... If I'm not confident on this

844
03:09:11,079 --> 03:09:20,950
doing it once or twice, then yeah, I'll try. I'll try extreme. Seems my luck has run out.

845
03:09:20,950 --> 03:09:25,829
I don't blame you. I did try to eliminate you. There's no point in hiding myself from me now.

846
03:09:26,549 --> 03:09:43,030
This inevitable death is upon me. I didn't even get a chance. He had two souls in his head.

847
03:09:43,030 --> 03:09:49,750
You're orange. Started out as a minor inconvenience as it mostly does. For years and years and years

848
03:09:49,750 --> 03:09:55,030
of endless enjoyment, our physical bodies were simply not keeping up with what our minds desired.

849
03:09:56,760 --> 03:10:00,680
Not a sense of sickness or pain, none of that existed. But through sheer exhaustion,

850
03:10:01,399 --> 03:10:08,120
our bodies from our primordial worlds would not adapt into the freedom of our new home.

851
03:10:08,120 --> 03:10:12,700
This, of course, wasn't the case for every inhabitant. But as a former human, it certainly

852
03:10:12,700 --> 03:10:19,909
was for me. You don't have to do this to yourself. Don't let chat peer pressure you. No, I know.

853
03:10:19,909 --> 03:10:25,620
If it's too much for me, I'm just going right back to hard. And I will not care at all.

854
03:10:25,620 --> 03:10:29,780
Sometimes games go from hard to extreme, and extreme is like impossible. So don't worry.

855
03:10:29,780 --> 03:10:36,329
We usually found quick solutions such as potions, surgery, and artificial limbs.

856
03:10:36,889 --> 03:10:41,079
But our demands grew more ambitious and we continued to evolve ourselves,

857
03:10:41,079 --> 03:10:43,639
all in the name of making our existence as joyful as possible.

858
03:10:44,729 --> 03:10:48,170
Our ways became twisted. We felt the urge to play pranks on each other,

859
03:10:48,170 --> 03:10:52,899
throwing both friends and foes into pits of eternal hell, over and over just to experience

860
03:10:52,899 --> 03:10:59,049
the days and months. In this insane indulgence, this cruel and twisted nightmare,

861
03:10:59,049 --> 03:11:05,819
inhabitants started to disappear altogether. I suspect they found a way to end their immortality.

862
03:11:06,459 --> 03:11:10,899
Brown mage. We're just like pranking each other by killing each other,

863
03:11:10,899 --> 03:11:23,979
just to like know that time passed. That's kind of fucked up.

864
03:11:23,979 --> 03:11:32,010
Oh, this person. What do you want to do? They're everywhere. What do they want? What do they want?

865
03:11:32,010 --> 03:11:34,889
Leave me be. I don't want to. Make it stop. Make it stop. Make it stop. Make it stop.

866
03:11:35,530 --> 03:12:02,389
What are you doing? What are you doing? I'm just, I'm freeing you. That was upsetting.

867
03:12:04,870 --> 03:12:10,760
Back to the entrance. Yes. Build a save. I don't think the save points have a soul.

868
03:12:11,719 --> 03:12:32,579
They don't. Okay. I think that's everybody in the forest. I believe that's everybody.

869
03:12:32,579 --> 03:12:50,379
Interact with the ball. You shake the magic eight ball. It says,

870
03:12:50,379 --> 03:12:55,579
Zig is relaxing in the dance club in a bad mood. Oh, it tells you where to go. Okay.

871
03:12:55,579 --> 03:13:20,659
How the hell do I get out of here? How do I get out of here? I'm a save point and I have a soul.

872
03:13:20,659 --> 03:13:29,180
How do I get out of here? Wait, what's that? You can open that door? Eventually?

873
03:13:29,180 --> 03:13:49,079
Oh, get him out. Get me out of here. Use the door to the right of the lab.

874
03:13:49,079 --> 03:14:07,979
Oh, I went the complete wrong way then. The spirits.

875
03:14:24,229 --> 03:14:29,510
Why the fuck do you eat cauliflower with mustard? Why do you think I do that? Who told you I did

876
03:14:29,510 --> 03:14:50,219
that? I don't, I don't, is there something wrong with that? They never were truly alive.

877
03:14:50,219 --> 03:14:58,309
The mushrooms were never alive. There was the type of guy to watch

878
03:14:58,309 --> 03:15:02,229
anime intro openings and complain that that's not what's put on the radio.

879
03:15:02,229 --> 03:15:27,690
This door is locked. What's going on in here? And what's going on in here?

880
03:15:28,250 --> 03:15:40,760
It's a vicious insult. I mean, is it an insult if it's not even real?

881
03:15:47,260 --> 03:15:54,340
Okay. That's like you saying to me. Oh, German man. Like, God, imagine being the guy that likes

882
03:15:54,340 --> 03:15:59,700
putting fucking call mustard on cauliflower. I've never eaten that before in my life. Right?

883
03:15:59,700 --> 03:16:07,860
Like that doesn't insult me. I've never done that before. I don't like want anime intros on

884
03:16:07,860 --> 03:16:13,110
the radio. Like, I mean, if that were on there, that'd be cool. Fine. But I don't like care.

885
03:16:13,110 --> 03:16:25,290
All E flower. How do you say it? Good music, good people. I lived good.

886
03:16:25,850 --> 03:16:41,000
Goodbye. What is that? What's this? Is it a wanted poster? Oh, it's a robot. Get him.

887
03:16:42,040 --> 03:16:47,180
There's no escape. I always wondered if I was truly conscious. I might finally get some answers.

888
03:16:47,899 --> 03:16:57,239
You want to fight, huh? You act tough, but I've never seen you throw any punches.

889
03:16:57,239 --> 03:17:02,709
This time, I'll teach you a lesson. Yeah, turns out, turns out you didn't have a soul.

890
03:17:08,420 --> 03:17:28,629
No soul in the robot. I know that's sad. Oh, this seems so easy by comparison to everything else.

891
03:17:44,149 --> 03:18:39,940
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do. This song was awesome. Let's go. Phase two. Shit. Shit.

892
03:18:46,520 --> 03:19:33,979
Fuck you. I expert. I can do it. I can do it. I can do it. It's easy. I can do it. Come on,

893
03:19:33,979 --> 03:21:14,020
Gwen. Come on, Gwen. All right. You idiot. Can I touch it? I can. Oh, how are you so fast? Last

894
03:21:14,020 --> 03:22:04,920
time. You got lucky. This time. Oh, you won't be so lucky. Oh, shit. I almost lost. I don't feel so

895
03:22:04,920 --> 03:22:16,899
good. Expert makes them have more health and you don't have as much time. I mean, we'll do it for

896
03:22:16,899 --> 03:22:31,940
a little while. Getting kind of creepy. Someone did the math on this game and the people living

897
03:22:31,940 --> 03:22:52,149
in it. They've been living for 12 million years. God. Oh, what about this guy? Worked too much.

898
03:22:52,149 --> 03:23:07,780
Should have done other things. Damn. I've had a great time. I've had a great time. I had a great

899
03:23:07,780 --> 03:23:17,610
time. I had a great time. Does the ATM have a soul? That would be kind of funny. Do not harm the

900
03:23:17,610 --> 03:24:06,440
automatic terror machine or it will harm you. Oh, shit. It does. I thought I could be sneaky. Oh,

901
03:24:06,440 --> 03:25:01,739
I can't grab those. Come on, Gwen. Shoot it. Do not damage evil property. Ice over. It did have a

902
03:25:01,739 --> 03:25:47,340
soul. I guess it did. Rabbit. Way to go. Way to go. No. Oh, what's going on? What the fuck?

903
03:25:51,780 --> 03:26:32,200
What is it? I can't catch these. Speaking a different language? Yikes. Yikes. That's fucking

904
03:26:32,200 --> 03:26:51,690
crazy. All right. Retry, right? I think I can do it. I can do it backwards. The text is backwards.

905
03:26:51,690 --> 03:27:34,840
Last checkpoint. Try again. This one was wacky. I got to focus real hard here. Holy shit in my

906
03:27:34,840 --> 03:27:48,219
fucking diaper. I was told to not say die forever again and I just did. I have more than one person.

907
03:27:48,219 --> 03:28:19,959
I know. I got to roll over those. Oh, fuck you. I had it. Wow. It's impossible. No, it's not.

908
03:29:07,110 --> 03:29:16,760
Damn it. It's so hard. I want to beat around the experts so bad. Same exact spot as last time.

909
03:29:16,760 --> 03:29:22,540
Shit. Difficulty. I know. I know. All right. You need to jump and press the direction.

910
03:29:23,899 --> 03:29:31,799
I know. I know. I know. There's a lot going on on the screen. There's all this candy shit

911
03:29:31,799 --> 03:30:27,110
all over the screen. What's it doing? Oh, where are we going? Don't die. Don't go backwards on

912
03:30:27,110 --> 03:30:45,659
me here, please. It's so hard to tell where the fucking thing is. Was I supposed to touch that?

913
03:30:45,659 --> 03:32:14,979
I jumped over it. Shit. What are you doing? Oh, no. Do you have what it takes? Human? I don't know.

914
03:32:14,979 --> 03:32:39,260
Oh, damn. Damn. That was close. Not required. You all right? You seem distressed. Hey, buddy.

915
03:32:39,260 --> 03:32:56,170
Do you want to save? Yeah. I ran out of time. Like 15% health? No. No, what? You idiot. What happened?

916
03:32:56,170 --> 03:33:04,409
That was your backup. My brother's two, three... All right. Start timing out the people.

917
03:33:04,489 --> 03:33:10,379
Writing about how fat their family members are. Okay. I don't care. What did I just do? I saved

918
03:33:10,379 --> 03:33:24,010
over the backup? We have been. Okay. All right. All right. All right. What happened? Did I blow it?

919
03:33:24,010 --> 03:33:39,780
You saved over the one before you went into kill mode. Oh, that's all right. It's okay.

920
03:33:39,780 --> 03:33:48,389
It's all right. That was wild. I thought I had it. I guess once the kind of neon colored ones,

921
03:33:48,389 --> 03:33:53,430
once I can collect, once those started to come down, I didn't know I was supposed to kill.

922
03:33:53,909 --> 03:34:05,209
Oh, I have to kill you. I'm glad I still remember you. Would I please tell you something? Sure.

923
03:34:05,930 --> 03:34:10,739
You haven't said a word during the time we've known each other. You helped me even when I had

924
03:34:10,739 --> 03:34:14,659
done something bad to you. Without you, I never would have made it to the Gold Pig's temple.

925
03:34:14,659 --> 03:34:21,129
You helped Flan in that game. Even though they attacked you later, you helped Green Mage get

926
03:34:21,129 --> 03:34:27,100
their eye back. Maybe it was all just to get your arm back. I don't know. It feels like there's

927
03:34:27,100 --> 03:34:33,819
something bigger going on here. Maybe like an important cause? Do I have something to tell you?

928
03:34:35,000 --> 03:34:39,899
Green Mage blocked the door to Midnight Town. There's a hidden entrance.

929
03:34:39,899 --> 03:34:45,750
Green Mage told me to keep it hidden. I think Green Mage gave me this job because I would forget

930
03:34:45,750 --> 03:34:57,530
where it was. It would remain hidden for everyone. I trust what you are doing, Red. I think I'm ready

931
03:34:57,530 --> 03:35:11,639
now. Bye, old friend. May we see each other again. In the second eternity where we cannot die.

932
03:35:12,569 --> 03:35:29,959
Immortality in heaven. Where the whole thing starts over again. I won't allow you to go any further.

933
03:35:29,959 --> 03:35:35,930
Last time you had your arm, so many perished. If anyone else dies,

934
03:35:37,420 --> 03:35:45,379
I just cannot stand by and watch it happen again. I'm gonna sneeze during this and I can't mute

935
03:35:45,379 --> 03:37:13,959
because I'm playing. I'm ready. Oh, come on. Bullshit. Give me a break. I tapped it. What the

936
03:37:13,959 --> 03:37:18,600
fuck are you talking about, bro? I was hitting X on the right spot. This is making me really mad.

937
03:39:33,530 --> 03:39:51,500
Get the fuck out of here. God, that was hard. That was crazy. That's a severe

938
03:39:51,500 --> 03:40:08,379
concentration. Whew. It wasn't enough. I can't believe Holly beat that for you. Shh, don't say

939
03:40:08,379 --> 03:40:16,139
that. No, I'm gaming right now. All right, you can go. You can go in the other room. Thank you so

940
03:40:16,139 --> 03:40:34,280
much. Yeah, thank you. I'll see you. All right, who's left in here? Good job, Holly. Come on.

941
03:40:34,920 --> 03:40:51,690
Hey, what are you doing? You do have a pacifist save. It's the second file. Oh, that's right. It's

942
03:40:51,690 --> 03:41:07,290
a little bit before the end of the game though, right? What about this guy? You're asking for

943
03:41:07,290 --> 03:41:19,290
trouble? No trouble making in my shop. Actually get to go against the shopkeeper. Good luck on

944
03:41:19,290 --> 03:41:30,569
this one. Oh man. All right, is this when we turn it down to hard? Find out. Oh, you can't grab those.

945
03:41:31,129 --> 03:41:47,370
You can't grab those either. All right, I get it. I was trying to grab all those in the beginning.

946
03:41:47,930 --> 03:42:30,139
You can only grab the orange ones. Oh, this is crazy. Okay, I'll give it a few more tries.

947
03:42:30,139 --> 03:44:38,790
You got to just sneak in there and sneak out real quick. Come on. What? No. Oh my goodness.

948
03:44:38,790 --> 03:44:46,870
Oh, yeah. All right. Okay. All right. All right. All right. We're going back to hard. That's insane.

949
03:44:46,870 --> 03:44:57,239
Let's go. That's wild. Especially when your left is right, right is left. I don't know about that

950
03:44:57,239 --> 03:45:16,149
one. Oh, did I training wheels myself though? We'll see. No, it's still pretty bad.

951
03:45:53,590 --> 03:46:58,739
Shit. All right. Now we reset. Reset. Oh my God. You idiot. Oh man.

952
03:47:01,430 --> 03:47:46,540
Give me something to throw at him. Shit. Going to be close.

953
03:47:55,100 --> 03:48:00,149
That was probably the best song of the whole game. That was awesome.

954
03:48:04,360 --> 03:48:26,010
Such a shame. Getting down to the final like 10. Getting a little weird. Oh, the chest. Can I still

955
03:48:26,010 --> 03:48:39,719
open this? I don't want to kill the chest. I want to open it. Didn't say the brown mage had it.

956
03:48:39,879 --> 03:48:55,399
This is getting pukey. All right. Here's the brown mage. What do you want? Kill. Who's making

957
03:48:55,399 --> 03:49:21,690
that ruckus? Scram and get out of here. Bring me batteries. Oh, yes. Finally, I can power my

958
03:49:21,690 --> 03:49:30,520
toilet. All right. I promise you. Here's a lava lamp. Oh, no. I seem to have lost it. Bring me

959
03:49:30,520 --> 03:49:34,520
a trampoline. Then I can give you something. That's super promise. All right. Fuck this guy.

960
03:49:40,620 --> 03:49:44,860
Forgive me for my thoughtless requests. I shall reward you greatly for your endeavors.

961
03:49:44,860 --> 03:50:00,979
I will need you to open the secret entrance to my keep. Okay. Please be very discreet. The secret

962
03:50:00,979 --> 03:50:06,180
entrance is located south of the pool of water. You'll find a pile of rocks and a door. I've

963
03:50:06,180 --> 03:50:33,340
unlocked it for you. Okay. So I have to go down there? All right. Wait. What about down here?

964
03:50:33,340 --> 03:51:03,860
Open it with my arm. Yes. You want to go in? Yes. What's all these tally marks? Oh, it's you. Hey

965
03:51:03,860 --> 03:51:12,040
there. I'm a bit surprised that you broke into my cellar. I guess I shouldn't be. Now what is it

966
03:51:12,040 --> 03:51:31,909
that you want? Go down first. Don't kill. Go down first. Did I go down first? Am I going to soft

967
03:51:31,909 --> 03:51:45,700
lock myself out of something? Yes. Yeah. Go down first. Okay. Just wait that way. Just wait that

968
03:51:45,700 --> 03:52:06,120
way. Okay. So go down from here. Okay. What the hell is this? Sign says turn on colorblind mode

969
03:52:06,120 --> 03:52:25,239
in settings. I think I prefer it on, especially in battles. Really? I have to turn it on? You

970
03:52:25,239 --> 03:52:38,659
don't have to. Oh, I thought it was required for this exact mission or something. Wait, this is him.

971
03:52:38,659 --> 03:52:51,590
Dear Brown Mage, you never want to do anything lately. Just sit in your little hole and eat and

972
03:52:51,590 --> 03:52:56,309
eat and eat. There isn't really anyone on my level and I'm bored out of my mind. I might give the

973
03:52:56,309 --> 03:53:07,940
mushrooms a visit and yes, I'll be taking the ruby with me. Marine Mage, welcome friend. I sadly have

974
03:53:07,940 --> 03:53:13,540
some bad news. I seem to have miscalculated my hypothesis. I need a very rare type of stick.

975
03:53:14,260 --> 03:53:18,899
Unless you have a special type of stick. Wait, you do? Give it to me and I'll finish it.

976
03:53:19,459 --> 03:53:30,299
Finally, I give you this as you have given me so much. The golden key. This key will unlock

977
03:53:30,299 --> 03:53:55,219
secrets. I got a golden key. Okay. Is this person alive? A well-maintained porcelain toilet. Looks

978
03:53:55,219 --> 03:54:04,729
expensive. Why are you acting so hostile? What do you want? Wait. Oh no. I've been tricked. It's

979
03:54:05,290 --> 03:54:13,299
you. Even after everything I've done for you. We don't fight him. He just, oh shit, we didn't

980
03:54:13,299 --> 03:54:30,440
even get a, you don't go, you don't get a cool song apparently. Oh shit, okay. All right, let's

981
03:54:30,440 --> 03:54:51,450
go to the chest and then I want to open that other door too with the gold lock. Save the game first.

982
03:54:51,450 --> 03:55:17,239
Save, save, save, save, save, save. All right, chest. What do you want to do? Interact. You want

983
03:55:17,239 --> 03:55:36,180
to use the key? Yes. Something powerful seems to resonate with the golden key. Are you sure? Yes.

984
03:55:36,180 --> 03:55:45,209
All right. Who is it? Dr. Manhattan? Who's in here?

985
03:56:26,729 --> 03:56:30,729
Holy shit. That gets a little, okay, that got a little crazy.

986
03:56:30,729 --> 03:56:43,299
Why is my pee green? I don't know. Go to a doctor. That's a question for a doctor, not me.

987
03:57:31,159 --> 03:57:32,120
What?

988
03:58:15,989 --> 03:58:36,250
I can grab those? I thought I couldn't. I thought I couldn't grab those. I thought I

989
03:58:36,250 --> 03:58:39,450
couldn't grab those. I thought I couldn't. I can't. I can grab those. I thought I couldn't.

990
03:58:41,180 --> 03:58:43,340
Oh, I didn't know I could grab those. I thought I could jump over them.

991
03:58:43,500 --> 03:59:28,459
I can grab them. Shit. I'm an idiot. Oh man. All right. Gamer Fatigue is sitting in. Gamer Fatigue

992
03:59:28,459 --> 03:59:46,739
is sitting in I think. Let me drink some water. Gamer Fatigue is sitting in. I'm ready. This is

993
03:59:46,739 --> 03:59:51,989
one of the hardest battles in the game. I'll get it. It might take me a few more. I got to get

994
03:59:51,989 --> 04:01:54,379
through the Gamer Fatigue and I'll be fine. We're good. God damn it. Motherfucker, that lasts so

995
04:01:54,379 --> 04:02:11,979
long. His brain's overheating. Oh, it is. Oh, I was close. 30%. You ever shower with your socks on?

996
04:02:12,620 --> 04:02:20,200
No, I don't. All right. All right. It's all about you got to move to the edges of the screen.

997
04:02:20,760 --> 04:03:13,770
You can't panic. My nose is burning. Okay. Oh my God. All right. I'm out. I'm out. No, I'm out.

998
04:03:13,770 --> 04:03:32,600
I can't leave. I'm stuck here forever. I think I'm stuck here forever. We'll forgive you if

999
04:03:32,600 --> 04:03:39,159
you lower the difficulty. I think I can do it. I think my brain's starting to get a little

1000
04:03:39,159 --> 04:05:03,030
fried from the game though, to be honest. I think we're frying out.

1001
04:05:06,709 --> 04:05:42,100
Fuck you. Same exact spot as last time. Same spot as last time. I'm so close though. I can

1002
04:05:42,100 --> 04:05:49,540
feel it. I got him to 25% health. I just got to get through that section and I got this shit.

1003
04:05:49,540 --> 04:05:56,709
That section is the worst part. If he goes back to the first verse again, oh, it's over. I'll get

1004
04:05:56,709 --> 04:06:14,739
him. I'll get him. Take a break. Take a break. All right. We'll take a break for a second. Deep

1005
04:06:14,739 --> 04:06:29,219
breathing. Let's go. All right. So when he does the second part of that chorus, everything comes

1006
04:06:29,219 --> 04:06:37,799
down. There's two blips where you're safe and you have to collect them both and fire it back.

1007
04:06:37,879 --> 04:06:45,049
Everything else is full. Shower with some socks on and eat cauliflower and mustard.

1008
04:06:45,049 --> 04:06:49,750
You can just dodge it and do the fight later. Yeah, but I want to kill this motherfucker.

1009
04:06:52,120 --> 04:08:08,739
Okay. I'm ready. One more attempt and I'm going to go pee.

1010
04:09:05,739 --> 04:09:15,260
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Quiet. Everybody quiet. I'm in the same spot.

1011
04:09:15,260 --> 04:09:27,299
It happened the exact same spot again. Okay. We're not upset about anything. We're just

1012
04:09:27,299 --> 04:09:33,000
exclaiming the fact that I need to probably move to the left side. I'll move to the left side

1013
04:09:33,000 --> 04:09:39,399
instead of the right side. It's mirroring the pattern. I know. I know. Tasmanian devil.

1014
04:09:44,200 --> 04:09:50,579
Hold on. Did that actually sound like the Tasmanian devil? Oh my God. Let me see. Let me hear it.

1015
04:09:50,579 --> 04:10:05,579
It's okay to be upset. I know. Oh man. It's the same spot. Oh shit. It keeps happening in

1016
04:10:05,579 --> 04:10:17,899
the same location. I got to move to the left side. You're going to piss yourself? Oh, I'm good. I'm

1017
04:10:17,899 --> 04:10:40,340
good. You can hear it. Okay. You want to know what happened? So right here, I can pinpoint

1018
04:10:40,340 --> 04:10:45,139
you the exact place where my brain decided to try to switch this from anger to like,

1019
04:10:45,540 --> 04:10:53,319
this is a funny voice, right? Right there. Because then I go like, I'm trying to look at this is a

1020
04:10:53,319 --> 04:11:02,709
funny voice now. Like that was me. That was my brain desperately trying to make you guys

1021
04:11:02,709 --> 04:11:10,489
think that that was like, oh, a funny voice I was doing. I realized that I was screaming and I had

1022
04:11:10,489 --> 04:11:14,649
to like in the middle of the scream, turn it into like a little funny. Oh, what a joke he's making.

1023
04:11:17,719 --> 04:11:26,149
Larry David. I'm not fucking going anywhere. This is the one right here. Halfway through that,

1024
04:11:26,790 --> 04:11:36,520
I was like, oh, I'm a comedian. Shut up and get it right. This is it. This is the one. This is

1025
04:11:36,520 --> 04:12:41,209
actually the one right now. I'm not fucking, I'm not going to get hit once. My face is so itchy.

1026
04:12:41,209 --> 04:12:51,159
My face is so itchy. It's ruining everything. Oh God damn it. Why does it itch? Why? Whatever.

1027
04:12:52,379 --> 04:14:16,579
I'm fucked. Yeah, I didn't beat him. Oh man. I'm finally free from the shackles. I hope to see you

1028
04:14:16,579 --> 04:14:36,700
soon. Goodbye to this wretched world. No. No. No. I failed the DPS check. Reload the save.

1029
04:14:44,379 --> 04:14:52,860
You can find them again. Oh, I can fight them again. Okay. Shit, that was crazy. What do I

1030
04:14:52,860 --> 04:14:57,899
want to do? What is it? Gems of power and soul bound gems, sometimes known as the fruits of the

1031
04:14:57,899 --> 04:15:09,379
gods. Okay. There are different gems in this world. Many are already known, but it's likely

1032
04:15:09,379 --> 04:15:13,379
there are still just as many waiting to be discovered. It truly harnessed the gem's full

1033
04:15:13,379 --> 04:15:17,059
potential. It just needs to fuse the gem with their body and soul. These are known as soul

1034
04:15:17,059 --> 04:15:28,649
binding gems. One should be cautious of soul binding gems as they have a tendency to change

1035
04:15:28,649 --> 04:15:34,260
the very nature of the ego once they are truly connected. In essence, it's very unnatural.

1036
04:15:34,260 --> 04:15:41,270
The melding process is known to be quite painful. For a gem to become a soul bound gem,

1037
04:15:41,270 --> 04:15:50,790
it needs to replace at least one of the five senses. I hate that. I keep thinking about how

1038
04:15:50,790 --> 04:15:56,459
much I hated how I said that. One or more need to be sacrificed so the gem can be truly activated.

1039
04:15:56,860 --> 04:16:34,729
Especially considering it was like it happened in a sheshma. I hate it. I hate that sound. Oh,

1040
04:16:34,729 --> 04:16:38,969
right. Hey, you think you're tough coming in here and making a ruckus? I'll show you ruckus.

1041
04:16:43,159 --> 04:16:46,120
Oh, all right. We'll take a break after this. We'll go pee and I'll come back.

1042
04:16:46,120 --> 04:17:02,219
Crash can time. Stop farming 2022 awards. I'm not. I promise. All right. Relax, dude. Come on.

1043
04:17:04,520 --> 04:17:51,340
Not you, me. This is night and day compared to the last one. Good block. Holy shit. What are you

1044
04:17:51,340 --> 04:18:07,379
doing, man? I'm just completely jinxed at you. Not even my shell can protect me from you. We've

1045
04:18:07,379 --> 04:18:21,989
had a long time for this. 13. All right. I'll go pee. I will see you guys in two minutes. I'm

1046
04:18:21,989 --> 04:18:25,030
going to go pee. I'm going to grab a little bit more water. I'm going to shake around a little bit

1047
04:18:26,620 --> 04:18:30,299
my brain in the right place to do the rest of the game, which I'm assuming that we probably

1048
04:18:30,299 --> 04:22:12,069
are getting near the end here. I'll be right back. Okay, guys, somebody wants to say something.

1049
04:22:12,709 --> 04:22:20,889
They're a little groggy. They've been sleeping for a while. They don't want to be on camera.

1050
04:22:21,530 --> 04:22:42,149
Are you doing, Cheeto? Okay. Okay. Yeah, you're a little groggy. Tired. Do you want some coffee

1051
04:22:42,149 --> 04:22:53,290
or something? You've been asleep for like two years. Do you want anything? Okay. That's a very,

1052
04:22:53,290 --> 04:23:05,739
that's pretty big Burger King order. You want to, you want to shake? Okay. Chocolate? Okay.

1053
04:23:06,299 --> 04:23:17,540
You want me to put you back on the shelf? Okay. Back on the shelf. He's not ready for the camera

1054
04:23:17,540 --> 04:23:21,379
yet. He's a little tired. He was asleep for a couple of years. He doesn't want to be on camera.

1055
04:23:22,020 --> 04:23:33,530
The large Burger King order, McDonald's, whatever he wants. He's just waking up. It takes like a few

1056
04:23:33,530 --> 04:23:56,709
days to wake up. All right, let's go. We're going to do a Burger King Cheeto stream. All right,

1057
04:23:56,709 --> 04:24:12,299
who do we got left? I already did this stuff. What's Cheeto's order? So Cheeto really only

1058
04:24:12,299 --> 04:24:20,090
eats a very, very little. So Cheeto likes nuggets. So what ends up happening is he eats one nugget,

1059
04:24:20,090 --> 04:24:25,899
like the half of one nugget takes him like 45 minutes or so. He kind of nibbles at it. And

1060
04:24:25,899 --> 04:24:38,459
then I just eat the rest. Blue slime is working hard in the cursed castle. I opened this. Ow!

1061
04:24:39,430 --> 04:24:46,010
Thank you for removing the lock. Green mage locked me up to keep you away, I guess. Oh wait,

1062
04:24:46,010 --> 04:24:50,090
wasn't green mage like down in the thing? Yeah, hold on. Let's go get green mage. He was down.

1063
04:24:50,090 --> 04:25:19,850
Where was he? All right, let's go get him. Hi, green mage. Time to go. From this point forward,

1064
04:25:19,850 --> 04:25:30,969
I need 12 more souls. How much time do I think I got left in the game? This is where it ends.

1065
04:25:30,969 --> 04:25:39,530
After spending an eternity in mushroom forest. How anticlimactic. Maybe like an hour or two? All

1066
04:25:39,530 --> 04:26:02,940
right, cool. An absolute max of maybe two hours. Okay. All right, green. Let's go. I don't know,

1067
04:26:02,940 --> 04:26:24,059
I can catch these. Wait, stop. You're serious? Hear me out. If you want a true clash of life

1068
04:26:24,059 --> 04:26:37,819
and death, you'll have to spice it up. Come into my playroom. I wouldn't go in there if I were you.

1069
04:26:37,819 --> 04:26:42,540
That corridor is endless. Well, technically it isn't endless. There's an end. It'll just take

1070
04:26:42,540 --> 04:27:07,450
forever to get there. I know because I made the corridor. Hi, buddy. Main reason why I gave the

1071
04:27:07,450 --> 04:27:13,530
ruby to you is to have them separated. Together they are too powerful in wrong hands. The emerald

1072
04:27:13,530 --> 04:27:19,540
is locked inside an indestructible chest stored with an acquaintance of mine. For your own sake,

1073
04:27:19,540 --> 04:27:28,680
I won't tell you where the aquamarine is located. Take care of yourself, green. It takes four hours

1074
04:27:28,680 --> 04:27:32,760
to go down the hallway and there's shit in the hallway so you can't just tape a button down.

1075
04:27:33,639 --> 04:27:41,979
Are you kidding me? Welcome to my real playroom. Only a special few know of its existence.

1076
04:27:42,540 --> 04:27:45,739
Let us not delay the inevitable. Or are you too scared you might lose?

1077
04:27:46,540 --> 04:27:48,299
All right, it's time for you to die, motherfucker. Let's go.

1078
04:27:52,440 --> 04:28:02,040
Somebody said Forsen watched Shrek during the walk. Wait, are you serious? Hold on. Really?

1079
04:28:02,040 --> 04:28:23,430
That's fucking hilarious. Oh, that's amazing. I was there. I haven't felt this alive in a long

1080
04:28:23,430 --> 04:29:15,370
time. Let's go. It'll be the greatest duel ever. I can't pick those up. I'm trying to grab those

1081
04:29:15,370 --> 04:29:23,290
and it's too much. All right, sit up. I'm too busy trying to grab those ones and I just avoid them.

1082
04:29:59,290 --> 04:30:05,379
What am I doing wrong here? This is not that hard. I'm just overthinking it now.

1083
04:30:06,379 --> 04:30:12,780
The last insane electricity man. I need to put my brain back where it was.

1084
04:31:05,799 --> 04:31:59,959
Oh, fuck off. Can I catch those? What the fuck? Oh my god, you're killing me here.

1085
04:32:00,680 --> 04:32:35,610
I can't grab anything. Oh, shit. No, I'm good. I'm good. I'm good.

1086
04:32:36,170 --> 04:33:10,840
You gotta be fucking kidding me. Oh my god, you're gonna be kidding me. Pity loop? That's fine.

1087
04:33:10,840 --> 04:33:45,290
I got pity looped. It's all right. I'll take it. We'll do the two. I know 11. What characters

1088
04:33:45,290 --> 04:34:30,950
were even left? I'm not doing the hallway. I'm not doing that. No, that song was awesome.

1089
04:34:30,950 --> 04:34:47,080
That was a really good one. A blue slime in the castle. It's only four hours. That's four hours

1090
04:34:47,080 --> 04:35:12,790
too long. I think everybody's dead here. So this way is locked. Favorite type of cheese,

1091
04:35:12,790 --> 04:35:23,270
probably Swiss or some kind of cheddar probably. Where should I go? These people are in here,

1092
04:35:23,270 --> 04:35:33,669
right? The ghost people? What do you want? I bet what you heard from the forest spirit was not

1093
04:35:33,669 --> 04:35:57,220
what you wanted to hear. What are you doing? Oh, again? Oh, whoa. What? The blue slime is

1094
04:35:57,220 --> 04:36:15,349
working hard in the cursed castle. My work is not done. Still, I've had my revenge. You must kill

1095
04:36:15,349 --> 04:36:19,909
everyone from this immortal world before we allow you to continue. You have 11 souls to liberate.

1096
04:36:22,360 --> 04:36:29,639
Cannot kill what is already dead. You must kill everyone before we can close this realm.

1097
04:36:32,650 --> 04:36:37,049
I can give you something that will help you. Help you find the souls. Some might say the extra help

1098
04:36:37,049 --> 04:36:42,919
isn't necessary, but I say take all the help you can get. Do you want it? Yeah. This lantern,

1099
04:36:42,919 --> 04:36:56,200
it will help you find souls. I want to go away, but I can't seem to let go. What do you want?

1100
04:36:57,159 --> 04:37:01,529
Wait, what? The beast within the cursed castle protects a spirit.

1101
04:37:01,529 --> 04:37:08,979
Get the lantern. If you stand still, a guide will show you where the souls are. Oh,

1102
04:37:08,979 --> 04:37:17,189
this is what they were talking about. That person said that. Ah, all right. Cool. No help. No help.

1103
04:37:17,189 --> 04:37:55,459
No help. Where are you at? How does that make any sense? Why are you telling me to do that?

1104
04:37:55,459 --> 04:38:22,409
Nice GPS. Come here. Why does it run away every time? Annoying. Yeah, there's the night guide.

1105
04:38:22,409 --> 04:38:27,939
There's people in the castle too. God, our differences. Both of us had our own goals.

1106
04:38:28,500 --> 04:38:32,340
Me trying to stop you, you walking all over me and not showing any sympathy.

1107
04:38:32,340 --> 04:38:37,619
Hurt my feelings. It hurt my finances. Right now, my friend, I understand that you're on some kind

1108
04:38:37,619 --> 04:38:45,659
of killing spree. You can't just let that slide, you know. All right, dude, let's go.

1109
04:39:05,849 --> 04:40:05,400
Match the colors. Huh? Please, can you stop? If I bother. The guy looks like German when he's

1110
04:40:05,400 --> 04:40:19,700
streaming. That's true. You sure are a tough guy, you little red twerp. There are 10 souls remaining.

1111
04:40:19,700 --> 04:40:46,889
We're gonna find them all. He's as naked as ever. Oh, we have to ride this back.

1112
04:40:46,889 --> 04:41:00,139
Probably shoot. What the fuck? There's somebody here. I didn't know that was okay.

1113
04:41:00,779 --> 04:41:12,709
There's somebody actually on the train. I can't really read what they're saying.

1114
04:41:39,900 --> 04:42:05,189
This is gonna hurt. This is gonna hurt. Yeah. Nine. I guess my days end here. Nobody else to

1115
04:42:05,189 --> 04:42:22,569
move the car. It's the only character with a damage animation. There's no music now. This

1116
04:42:22,569 --> 04:42:53,590
is weird. Who's next? I had a nap midstream. Why is he killing everyone? You're gonna have to go

1117
04:42:53,590 --> 04:43:04,090
back and see what happened. Oh no, not these. You ain't going nowhere. Against both at the same time.

1118
04:43:05,930 --> 04:43:10,970
Let's get him, Job. They both have such painful sound effects for noises.

1119
04:43:15,720 --> 04:43:28,060
He's gonna be screaming the whole time. It's gonna be so annoying. Oh, they have different health bars.

1120
04:43:28,700 --> 04:44:27,590
Oh god, that's too many sounds. Oh, the beat. I can't focus. I'm almost dead. It's too powerful.

1121
04:44:28,470 --> 04:45:10,099
Now what? Impossible. So he said, I don't get this combat system at all, but it looks fun.

1122
04:45:10,900 --> 04:45:16,659
So the first half of the game, you do not have a combat. You don't have a laser beam that I'm

1123
04:45:16,659 --> 04:45:21,700
shooting out. You essentially, well, I'll let you figure it out. It's a fun game. It's good.

1124
04:45:23,689 --> 04:45:47,220
Found a loophole in our contract. Kevin McCloud. A two? Yeah, down to seven. Oh no, I don't want

1125
04:45:47,220 --> 04:46:00,680
to kill these guys. I like these guys. Hey there, pal. Oh, you seem to have found your arm. Great

1126
04:46:00,680 --> 04:46:18,869
news. I like these guys. Hey buddy, great to see you again. You can't come here and cause a ruckus.

1127
04:46:18,869 --> 04:46:24,340
I don't like the vibes you're putting out, man. What does she teach you a thing or two about bad

1128
04:46:24,340 --> 04:46:30,169
behavior? You think that qualifies us to help, Buck? You got it right, Plant. We won't go easy

1129
04:46:30,169 --> 04:47:22,939
on you, kid. I really like these guys. I don't want to kill these guys. That was cool. He's cool.

1130
04:47:22,939 --> 04:47:44,889
Oh shit. Oh, he's pissed. What happened? What the fuck? I should have killed the turtle. I should

1131
04:47:44,889 --> 04:48:55,139
have killed the turtle first. It's Ornstein and Smog. Oi, oi. That is phase three. I got pity

1132
04:48:55,139 --> 04:49:15,290
looped again. No, I didn't. You horrible creature. I hate you. Down to five, right? Okay. Everyone,

1133
04:49:15,290 --> 04:49:59,000
they certified me. I feel bad. Okay. Somebody in here? They are in here. Oh, this shit. I remember

1134
04:49:59,000 --> 04:50:26,580
this. I got to go down. Just kidding. Up. I remember it. Do you want to stop killing? I don't know. I

1135
04:50:26,580 --> 04:50:42,380
feel like I'm doing the mission. I'm on the mission. No. I admire your determination, but I can't stay

1136
04:50:42,380 --> 04:50:48,040
in the choices you're making. I can't be part of this murderous crusade. One of your quests

1137
04:50:48,040 --> 04:52:21,909
must end now. Faster hand? All right. This game is crazy. Ooh, I like it. Okay, let's go. Damn.

1138
04:52:24,490 --> 04:53:12,439
Oh, my colors are blending together in my brain. Shit, I don't think I beat him. Jesus. I barely

1139
04:53:12,439 --> 04:53:20,419
got the loop. Come on. I want to see the heart rate. You should have seen the heart rate on

1140
04:53:20,419 --> 04:53:30,330
the magical lightning guy. Boy, the hand didn't have a soul, though. Oh, my God. What are you

1141
04:53:30,330 --> 04:53:56,020
doing? It was probably really high. All right. We'll lock doors. This is the beginning of the game.

1142
04:53:56,020 --> 04:54:01,060
I am free again, thanks to you. The mage has locked me up. Purple mage is in the room with

1143
04:54:01,060 --> 04:54:19,939
the mirror of truth. We trust in you to finish the deed. Who's in here? Wait, what? Oh, right.

1144
04:54:19,939 --> 04:54:45,700
What is that? Going to the theater? You killed the cursor. That's your hand now. Oh, okay. Oh,

1145
04:54:45,700 --> 04:54:57,590
the maze. The spider. That's right. Okay. Wait, why does it want me to go up here? Where was that

1146
04:54:57,590 --> 04:55:29,290
spider? Hold on. Let me go to the theater. Somebody in the theater. Who's in the theater?

1147
04:55:29,849 --> 04:56:01,669
It's a 50% chance every time you walk in. Where is he? Either you were lying to me or these are

1148
04:56:01,669 --> 04:56:15,909
some really stupid ridiculous odds. All right. Where's the spider, though? I want to do spider

1149
04:56:15,909 --> 04:56:37,479
first. There's still several people in the castle. Castle near the slime brothers. I'll just go back

1150
04:56:37,479 --> 04:56:51,990
down. You're insanely stupid sometimes. How? Because I didn't know that it was, I don't have

1151
04:56:51,990 --> 04:57:12,810
a Wikipedia open about how to trigger the event to happen. Oh, you. You're alive. You find pink

1152
04:57:12,810 --> 04:57:21,610
spirits and old saying says not to trust them. It'd be quite mischievous. I guess this is as

1153
04:57:21,610 --> 04:57:37,400
good as any place to die. It's cold and comfortable. What would you like to die for? What does that

1154
04:57:37,400 --> 04:58:11,529
sound? What if I can't? Do I play by myself? Sounds killing me. What is this? I don't.

1155
04:58:29,619 --> 04:58:49,180
Okay. Congratulations. There was a type of person to say please to his Alexa. Sure. Find the spider.

1156
04:58:49,740 --> 04:59:15,700
I'm here. Where are you? Where are you? Let's go. Favorite album of all time. Probably Demon

1157
04:59:15,700 --> 04:59:38,389
Days or Plastic Beach. I like them both equally. No, wait. Oh, right. I have to avoid those.

1158
04:59:42,090 --> 04:59:56,729
Right. That's going to be a pain in the ass. Okay. Avoid everything. Just avoid everything.

1159
05:00:38,680 --> 05:01:02,459
You stupid idiot. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. I couldn't press

1160
05:01:02,459 --> 05:01:05,900
it before and now you can't avoid it. No. Well, I. All right. No, no, no. Start over. Start over.

1161
05:01:05,900 --> 05:01:53,259
Let's just do this right. Shit. Dude, I'm slowing down hard. I feel like I've been looking at a

1162
05:01:53,259 --> 05:03:12,740
kaleidoscope for five straight hours. Oh my God. Sensory. Oh, stop. I'm turning it down. Oh my

1163
05:03:12,740 --> 05:03:34,630
goodness, dude. Come on. That was unbearable. Okay. Peace returning to the immortal realm.

1164
05:03:34,709 --> 05:04:44,180
Follow the pink. I was thinking about it. Up. We're here. Up. Whoa. What is this? Two, two, two.

1165
05:04:44,900 --> 05:05:00,340
Two, two, two. What do you want? Hello, red. Keep following the candy canes and you will arrive

1166
05:05:00,340 --> 05:05:42,009
at bubble gum land. You sure pack a punch. Okay. It's a long way. It's going to be a pain in the

1167
05:05:42,009 --> 05:05:53,930
ass to go back. Vampire guy said don't trust pink spirits. I'm not trusting them. I'm about

1168
05:05:53,930 --> 05:06:41,849
to kill them. Come here. Trust them. I'm here to murder them. How long is this? What the fuck?

1169
05:06:41,849 --> 05:07:04,950
Am I going to have to put on Shrek while I do this? Something's not right. I don't know what

1170
05:07:04,950 --> 05:07:41,740
it is. Something's not right. Something's not right. Oh, please. You just have to walk backwards.

1171
05:07:41,740 --> 05:07:56,979
Welcome to bubble gum land. Relax and rest. If I do a job badly, then you can do it well.

1172
05:07:56,979 --> 05:08:10,919
Is there a save point anywhere? Here is good to be a bubble gum entity. Welcome to bubble gum land.

1173
05:08:12,310 --> 05:08:25,000
The quest is so big. Big bubble gum spirit. Hello, red. By now you should have come across

1174
05:08:25,000 --> 05:08:31,500
the powers you wield. Only you can erase the inhabitants of this realm. The incredible power

1175
05:08:31,500 --> 05:08:36,700
which only you possess. Some life is supposed to extend into centuries while others are shorter.

1176
05:08:37,580 --> 05:08:43,819
If one is in a loop where they cannot die and yet they fear death, that is not a pleasant way to

1177
05:08:43,819 --> 05:08:51,020
live. That's why you, as the human, have a gift. You get to experience the world within all its

1178
05:08:51,020 --> 05:08:58,810
dualities. Unfairness and chaos. An expiration date. But someday this will all end. It is truly

1179
05:08:58,810 --> 05:09:05,720
the most bittersweet feature of your existence. I give you only my words of advice. If you're

1180
05:09:05,720 --> 05:09:11,740
doing this for a cause, a cause that is good, do what you think is right. If you do not agree,

1181
05:09:11,740 --> 05:09:16,779
then who is to stop a god of death? Much has been said. We must go on.

1182
05:09:19,349 --> 05:09:40,860
You didn't have a soul? All right, well, what's your deal? Oh, you found my backup secret hideout.

1183
05:09:41,659 --> 05:09:46,220
Now that you found me, what are you going to do? Are you going to finish me off because I

1184
05:09:46,220 --> 05:09:55,700
took your arm? Or are you going to stroll out where you came from? You are here to erase my

1185
05:09:55,700 --> 05:10:00,659
existence. You've destroyed my empire. You've ruined my reputation. You've forced me to flee

1186
05:10:00,659 --> 05:10:09,770
for my life. Your thirst to kill does not end only because I took your arm. You disgust me.

1187
05:10:09,770 --> 05:10:14,490
It's my life you want. I won't give it away easily. I will make you walk through hell.

1188
05:10:15,130 --> 05:10:58,680
Sure you will. Bubblegum hell. All right, let's go. Dude, it's easy. Just settle down.

1189
05:10:59,560 --> 05:12:04,939
You're going to let this shitty stuff hit you? Why do we keep seeing that thing? Someone's

1190
05:12:04,939 --> 05:12:14,069
vaping in your room, dude. You put on quite a show, you annoying wooden doll. You have bested me. I

1191
05:12:14,069 --> 05:12:21,060
wish thousands and millions of years of torment upon you. Hey, dude, you hit my car yesterday,

1192
05:12:21,060 --> 05:12:35,659
dickwad. Are you going to pay? You drove off and I'm going to go bankrupt. You hit my car.

1193
05:12:49,459 --> 05:13:07,240
There's two left. I'm assuming that's including me, right? It kind of has to be. Purple mage and me

1194
05:13:07,240 --> 05:13:17,819
are the last two people, right? Purple mage is waiting in the mirror of truth, praying.

1195
05:13:17,819 --> 05:13:52,310
And the theater only responds when you go back to the hub. Does that guy count? He's optional,

1196
05:13:52,310 --> 05:13:59,340
okay. Because I'll be honest with you, I don't know if my brain can handle fighting that guy again.

1197
05:13:59,979 --> 05:14:29,720
I could try maybe once or twice. How do I get out of here? Let's peep the horror. I don't have the

1198
05:14:29,720 --> 05:14:37,220
horror. All right, let's go up to the mirror, see what he has to say. I'm going to get a big

1199
05:14:37,220 --> 05:15:04,360
reveal, I guarantee it, right? Want my GameCube controller back? I don't have your GameCube

1200
05:15:04,360 --> 05:15:19,700
controller, man. All right, this is it. One of the final people to grab here. For many years,

1201
05:15:19,700 --> 05:15:24,979
I have been told that this mirror tells you the truth. I spent many nights thinking on this.

1202
05:15:27,450 --> 05:15:36,860
If you have any decency left, I urge you to leave, to stop this act and leave. You're not a killer.

1203
05:15:36,860 --> 05:15:44,169
Refund this game, if you can. Just leave us alone. Are we getting existential here?

1204
05:15:50,569 --> 05:15:56,569
You've come here to kill me. Maybe this was meant to be. Although, I won't give up my life easily.

1205
05:15:57,209 --> 05:16:04,630
Well, they say that because they know you're already five to six hours into the game,

1206
05:16:04,630 --> 05:16:10,659
you can't refund it. They don't put that shit an hour and 45 minutes into the game.

1207
05:16:10,659 --> 05:16:56,150
They put it six hours into the game. Oh, stop hitting me. It's all right, start it over again.

1208
05:16:57,029 --> 05:18:21,540
Sloppy. He's healing. Okay, stop being so sloppy. He's healing. This is one more.

1209
05:18:21,540 --> 05:18:53,659
This is how it ends. You fought well, I never stood a chance. The final gem. Go to the court

1210
05:18:53,659 --> 05:19:12,220
of the lost spirits. Back to those guys. All right, it's going to be me. It's definitely

1211
05:19:12,220 --> 05:19:29,669
going to be me. It's going to be me. I'm going to punch myself in the face and I'm going to end up

1212
05:19:29,669 --> 05:19:35,959
dying. I'm going to wake up somewhere in another world or something. Let me save it.

1213
05:19:42,229 --> 05:19:50,490
All right, so it's saved. Fight the light guy first. I don't think I have it in me.

1214
05:19:50,490 --> 05:20:10,810
Kill the lamp. Did I? Just do the light guy on easy mode. That's not a bad idea. I'll try that.

1215
05:20:10,810 --> 05:20:19,799
I'll turn it down just to see what happens when you win. Let's put it on normal or something.

1216
05:20:19,799 --> 05:20:47,689
Yeah, you can do it on normal. Okay, that's lame. Well, I want to see what happens. All right,

1217
05:20:47,689 --> 05:20:56,759
50% chance. All right, there it is. All right, this world is a shell. It gives me no pleasure

1218
05:20:56,759 --> 05:21:03,299
to witness this twisted experiment. All right, let's go for it. Let me just get the win here.

1219
05:21:04,099 --> 05:21:11,560
I'm not an expert. I just want to see the end. I'll put it back.

1220
05:21:11,560 --> 05:21:58,150
I can already read the chat messages that say lost on normal, so I can't lose.

1221
05:22:08,409 --> 05:23:26,950
All right, relax. Oh, fuck. I did it. That's heavy. Finally, a worthy warrior. Use it well.

1222
05:23:27,750 --> 05:23:56,470
That was pretty cool. What about the door in the forest? Is this my only opportunity to see that?

1223
05:23:56,470 --> 05:24:00,889
No one's left here. Okay. All right, let me save it here. I'm going to go look at it. That's true.

1224
05:24:00,889 --> 05:24:36,169
You can do it after the game, but that's in a while. Okay. Where? Do the right thing.

1225
05:24:39,860 --> 05:24:47,080
You're probably going to want to put this on normal again. Well, we'll find out.

1226
05:24:53,830 --> 05:25:19,259
That door was here somewhere. This one's okay. All right. What was that door over here? Where is it?

1227
05:25:19,259 --> 05:25:30,979
Do you like cucumbers? Yeah. Yeah. He's doing end of the screen voice. I'm kind of tired,

1228
05:25:30,979 --> 05:25:53,110
I'll be honest. My brain is... I feel like I've watched six movies. I'm so close here. This is

1229
05:25:53,110 --> 05:26:07,909
the final act of the game. I'm not going to stop now. Where is it? I feel like it was right here

1230
05:26:07,909 --> 05:26:48,540
somewhere. Oh, it's the thing. Is that professor's junk pile thing? Hello. Hello. Save. Down here.

1231
05:26:48,540 --> 05:26:54,659
The ending takes a while. You should probably just do it. How does it take a long time?

1232
05:27:04,810 --> 05:27:23,830
A jump rope holds itself up. You accept the challenge. Sure. All right. I'm going to give

1233
05:27:23,830 --> 05:29:01,700
this one my all here. I got enough time to do the ending. Attack yet. Whoa. Holy smokes.

1234
05:29:01,700 --> 05:29:24,520
I guess you don't kill this thing. Do you want to unlock the door with your arm? Sure.

1235
05:29:30,279 --> 05:29:56,069
Is that... All right. I got to just grab this. My head hurts. I got the aqua marine. All right.

1236
05:29:56,069 --> 05:30:11,979
Get me out. Get me out of here. Hey, my grandma said you're cute. All right. Well, just put me on

1237
05:30:11,979 --> 05:30:20,180
speaker. Put me on speaker. I'm going to assume that I'm on speaker. Put me on speaker now.

1238
05:30:22,840 --> 05:30:28,979
Hello there, darling. I just wanted to say I can't believe you think that I learned that I'm a cute

1239
05:30:28,979 --> 05:30:36,439
and attractive man. I don't know what you look like. I'm not entirely sure, but your grandson

1240
05:30:36,439 --> 05:30:42,569
seems to know quite a few. He's got a good taste. You know, I'm old. I don't know how old you are,

1241
05:30:42,569 --> 05:30:52,139
in particular, but I just want to say that your grandson's in good hands here. As he watches me,

1242
05:30:52,139 --> 05:30:59,180
I have a lot of good people here, a lot of friends and stuff, and family and everything.

1243
05:30:59,180 --> 05:31:03,099
Family's incredibly important, so I just want to let you know that your grandson's in a good place

1244
05:31:03,099 --> 05:31:14,409
right now. Do you think I'm cute? Thank you. Okay. Now take me off speakerphone. Dude,

1245
05:31:14,409 --> 05:31:43,619
pass the fucking joint. Dude, did you buy it? All right. Let's see the end. Remember, why do

1246
05:31:43,619 --> 05:32:11,159
you hate everything? What? I like frogs. All right. I'm ready. I'm going. I'm finishing the game.

1247
05:32:11,159 --> 05:32:20,860
I still have a little bit of juice left. I do. You're saying it's about an hour from here?

1248
05:32:20,860 --> 05:32:35,819
I have a little bit of gas left. I think I'm good to go. You got all the gems. Go in and out of the

1249
05:32:35,819 --> 05:32:53,639
blue door now. Do I actually have all the gems? I have aquamarine, emerald, and ruby. Where's the

1250
05:32:53,639 --> 05:33:11,110
diamond? Where's sapphire? Where's quartz? You're very close. The blue door is the true ending.

1251
05:33:11,110 --> 05:33:46,169
I gotta get out of here. No help. You've liberated everyone in the forest. The mushrooms are never

1252
05:33:46,169 --> 05:33:55,979
truly alive anyways. Okay. Final gem is black tourmaline. Well, then I must be pretty good for

1253
05:33:55,979 --> 05:34:07,479
my energy levels then. All right. So you think I can open the blue door? You mean this one here?

1254
05:34:07,479 --> 05:34:32,659
There's nothing alive in this part of the realm. Do you still wish to enter? So be it. I tell you

1255
05:34:32,659 --> 05:34:44,939
to budget. Oh, why is the game so quiet? Other blue door. Sorry about that. I turned it down from

1256
05:34:44,939 --> 05:35:03,750
blue door. The other blue door. In and out of a blue door. And that one? I mean this one here.

1257
05:35:03,750 --> 05:35:36,549
I would call that a gray door. Blue trim. Go in and out of it. The green door is better. I'm just

1258
05:35:36,549 --> 05:35:44,680
going in here. I'm just going in here. I'm just going in. I mean, there could be some super

1259
05:35:44,680 --> 05:35:57,220
secret weird thing. I'm just going for it. You have done a massive task. Everyone is dead except

1260
05:35:57,220 --> 05:36:03,959
one. Some of the ones you've slain might not approve of your actions. Those who felt wrong,

1261
05:36:03,959 --> 05:36:42,810
there will be reconciliation. It is time for you to come out. Hello, human. Or should I say,

1262
05:36:42,810 --> 05:36:51,319
hello, red? You've done well. It is time to go back home now. Close all the doors. Permanently.

1263
05:36:51,319 --> 05:37:08,540
Hardest part is coming up. Close all the doors. The door is locked. Okay, just get rid of all the

1264
05:37:08,540 --> 05:37:20,150
doors. Thank you for staying persistent and helping us. Finally, some peace in the world.

1265
05:37:20,150 --> 05:37:37,529
How do the doors talk? We had some good times. Now it's time to say goodbye. Okay. Finally,

1266
05:37:37,529 --> 05:37:57,299
peace blast. We meet again in another plane of existence. It's been awesome, buddy. Why is there

1267
05:37:57,299 --> 05:38:14,650
some nonchalant about this? You're doing the right thing. Am I going to come out of a birth canal?

1268
05:38:14,650 --> 05:38:18,939
Right? Am I about to like be born? Is this going to be like I'm born or something? It's supposed to be

1269
05:38:18,939 --> 05:38:33,020
purgatory. I'm going to wake up in a hospital bed. Stop the waiting room. Well done. This world has

1270
05:38:33,020 --> 05:38:38,380
lived for a long time. You have done a tremendous task. You could have quit any time you wanted.

1271
05:38:38,380 --> 05:38:42,700
But you pushed through even when it got difficult. This is a great feat that only a few could

1272
05:38:42,700 --> 05:38:53,220
accomplish. Use this determination wisely. Now only one remains. I told you it was me. As long

1273
05:38:53,220 --> 05:39:00,540
as the last star shines, we can't depart from this world. We shall grant you power to kill our son.

1274
05:39:00,540 --> 05:39:20,659
The rabbit? The final battle has begun. We must hurry. The last star needs to die for us to continue.

1275
05:39:31,580 --> 05:39:46,580
That was like Peter Griffin plays fucking Undertale. Oh god. Here we go.

1276
05:39:50,540 --> 05:40:09,020
Negative 103 Celsius. What? I can't catch that? What the fuck are you talking about?

1277
05:40:09,020 --> 05:40:15,430
Excuse me. I'm grabbing them. Do I have this timed wrong because it's stretched out?

1278
05:40:15,430 --> 05:41:51,529
Because the perceptions are warped. That's true. Ow. Ow. It's getting closer. It's getting closer.

1279
05:41:51,529 --> 05:42:45,529
Fuck you. Oh come on. Uh oh. Can I dodge? Damn. All right. Just blew up a son.

1280
05:43:06,680 --> 05:43:17,500
I'm sorry. It was open in the other window. I'm sorry. I had to put Larry David in there at the

1281
05:43:17,500 --> 05:44:27,799
very end. Victory screech. Uh oh. It's the absolute truth. Kingdom Hearts. Okay. Oh. I'm just shit so

1282
05:44:27,799 --> 05:44:32,520
bad. I'm not even kidding. I don't know what happened in like the 10 seconds that I started

1283
05:44:32,520 --> 05:44:44,340
this. Oh my god. What? I don't know why they crept up so hard on me. Oh. Okay. Let's go. Let's go.

1284
05:44:46,180 --> 05:45:37,419
The absolute truth. Okay. There's nothing to attack. I can't hurt it. I'm just going to queue

1285
05:45:37,419 --> 05:47:13,319
it up. All these lives you have destroyed. Who was wrong? Oh shit. I got to fight this guy.

1286
05:47:13,799 --> 05:48:17,400
Uh huh. Whatever you say. I don't know. Don't do that. Not now. Oh you can do better than that.

1287
05:48:17,400 --> 05:48:48,119
You can do better than that. Playtime is over. You thought you got away with no physical constraints.

1288
05:48:49,159 --> 05:48:55,819
We have the upper hand now. My hands are sweating and I have to shit. I'm going to shit my pants.

1289
05:48:55,819 --> 05:49:50,360
What? This has gone too far. Pink? Red has been helping us. We just didn't know. But they killed

1290
05:49:50,360 --> 05:49:59,939
us. Yes. They did. They did what I couldn't do. I thought- this person's naked. This person's

1291
05:49:59,939 --> 05:50:08,259
naked. I thought by not killing we should not fear death. I've read that so wrong. Look at that. I'm

1292
05:50:08,259 --> 05:50:11,619
a little on edge right now. I'm kind of like a lightning bolt. It's been really kind of tricky

1293
05:50:11,619 --> 05:50:21,459
to pay attention. I feel like somebody just put a blow dryer in my face for 15 straight minutes.

1294
05:50:21,459 --> 05:50:29,400
Do I have to keep going? Are you on Adderall? No. That was crazy. There was too much going on.

1295
05:50:29,400 --> 05:50:50,310
Are you still going? I can't understand how you went through with this monstrous act.

1296
05:50:50,310 --> 05:50:56,279
You're the only one with powers to kill in a world of immortals. Against their will you took

1297
05:50:56,279 --> 05:51:03,770
their lives. That's not true. Half of these people were like, yes please kill me. Hooray. I'm happy.

1298
05:51:04,409 --> 05:51:08,009
What do you mean against their will? Like 70% of the people were happy I was doing this.

1299
05:51:08,009 --> 05:51:17,560
Was it my purpose to kill everyone? What do you mean that's not true? Half the people were like,

1300
05:51:17,560 --> 05:51:24,709
yeah well here it is. I'm happy. Thank you. I was being thanked because I sent her on a mission.

1301
05:51:24,709 --> 05:51:29,610
Have I forgotten my destiny? Don't be mistaken. I have thought about this for many years.

1302
05:51:30,619 --> 05:51:34,939
So many wanted to end their lives and didn't struggle. Even if they had asked me I didn't-

1303
05:51:34,939 --> 05:51:42,540
I don't think I could have killed them. What are you talking about? You were the one that killed us.

1304
05:51:42,540 --> 05:51:48,939
What? No. It was the doll. Her body was burned up in the incinerator, pink.

1305
05:51:50,540 --> 05:51:56,069
But as always the main problem was that- what was it? The main problem is something- you were in

1306
05:51:56,069 --> 05:52:03,819
there. That's the issue. You were inside. To cope with losing your body you create an illusion.

1307
05:52:03,819 --> 05:52:15,240
What? Don't go. No. After everything you were still the killer. No it wasn't me. It was not me.

1308
05:52:15,560 --> 05:52:20,840
I did not kill you. I was not. I did not do that. I did not hit her. I am stuck here now.

1309
05:52:21,639 --> 05:52:27,560
Was this all a test? I cannot do this alone. Please Red, you have to help me. I beg you,

1310
05:52:27,560 --> 05:52:46,119
you have to help me. I cannot do it alone. Is Daffy Duck gonna come over here with a pencil

1311
05:52:46,119 --> 05:52:51,080
in his hand and be like, don't don't don't erase me. You're an idea. And I'm gonna start like

1312
05:52:51,080 --> 05:53:18,599
drawing shit on him. Not the entire body, but it will have to do. Control me like you have always

1313
05:53:18,599 --> 05:53:35,189
done. Please guide me. Is that the Konami code? I guess. Where do we go? Is it really all in my

1314
05:53:35,189 --> 05:53:48,439
head? It couldn't have been. I know you're out there. What if I- you'll be my eyes. I trusted you,

1315
05:53:48,439 --> 05:54:02,009
human. Guide me out of this hellscape. It works. I can't believe it. Sorry. I'll remain silent.

1316
05:54:02,009 --> 05:54:09,319
As long as I trust you, you can guide me. Shut up. You just said you were gonna stop talking.

1317
05:54:29,669 --> 05:54:38,299
It's a frog. What do you wanna do? The journey is almost over now. Do you wanna save? Yes.

1318
05:54:43,020 --> 05:54:54,180
Thanks. What do you wanna do? Hello, Pink. Knowing you've accomplished what I asked of you

1319
05:54:54,900 --> 05:55:00,200
makes me a very happy frog. Your biggest challenge is yet to come. Please,

1320
05:55:00,200 --> 05:55:09,259
stay and relax until you feel ready. Let me know if you have any questions. Okay. I mean,

1321
05:55:09,259 --> 05:55:16,180
I've got quite a lot of questions, actually. What is behind that? Beyond there lies the end of your

1322
05:55:16,180 --> 05:55:21,319
journey. I don't understand. I can give you a hundred different explanations for what's behind

1323
05:55:21,319 --> 05:55:26,360
that door. But in the end, you're gonna come out the birth canal either way. It don't matter

1324
05:55:26,360 --> 05:55:41,299
what I say. You just have to find out. Where are we? We're not in the physical world anymore.

1325
05:55:41,299 --> 05:55:46,389
We're not in the end either. We're in a sort of waiting room. Just for you to collect yourself

1326
05:55:46,389 --> 05:55:53,099
and come to peace. I'm fine. I don't have to- I'm fine. Like, I heard- I felt the gurgles for a

1327
05:55:53,099 --> 05:56:02,490
minute and now I'm fine. Don't worry. Is that how I'm supposed to do that? I'll admit, I did not

1328
05:56:02,490 --> 05:56:31,479
expect this. I'm sorry. Don't worry. If you're fine, then gamble on a fart. Why are you just

1329
05:56:31,479 --> 05:56:43,930
assuming and implying that I have to do that? I don't need- I don't have to do that. I'm just

1330
05:56:43,930 --> 05:57:08,409
kind of walking right now. There's nothing here. Oh, please. So what is the final boss, then?

1331
05:57:08,409 --> 05:57:37,080
It's gonna be me. It's- it's gonna be me. It smells horrible. Let it happen. Oh, no. Did I

1332
05:57:37,080 --> 05:57:47,659
shit my pants? It's cold. What? It doesn't feel good. It's uncomfortable. I didn't mean to. No,

1333
05:57:47,659 --> 05:58:00,310
no. I won't. I just killed him. Age will always get you human, but some of us found a way out.

1334
05:58:00,310 --> 05:58:07,290
But it requires immense determination. The only way for you out, Pink, is to surrender yourself.

1335
05:58:07,849 --> 05:58:16,599
But I think you already knew that. Have what it takes to save Pink. Yes. Good. You see things

1336
05:58:16,599 --> 05:58:24,380
through. That is a good trait, but it's far from looking. Look into the darkness. Face the abyss.

1337
05:58:24,380 --> 05:58:42,900
Shit your pants. Just do it. Water's getting deeper. It's cold. It doesn't feel good.

1338
05:58:43,540 --> 05:58:55,659
Uncomfortable. It hurts. Everything is burning. I guess I- I forgot a problem. That's- that's way-

1339
05:58:55,659 --> 05:59:17,939
that's, uh, a few too many Taco Bell Diablo sauces on that. Eagle funny. I know. Trust me. I get it.

1340
05:59:17,939 --> 05:59:39,369
What happened? Uh, I'm coming out of the birth canal. I told you. It's been some time since we

1341
05:59:39,369 --> 06:00:30,200
last saw each other. All right. Holy shit. We're all good friends and we all get together sometimes.

1342
06:00:30,200 --> 06:00:36,409
When you're feeling down and you're feeling out of luck and out of change, we will work together

1343
06:00:36,409 --> 06:00:42,169
and we will have- I'm sorry. I- that's what I expected. That's what I expected. I expected that.

1344
06:00:42,169 --> 06:00:56,220
You have to understand. I can't hear anything. I can't even hear my own thoughts.

1345
06:00:56,939 --> 06:01:02,709
I have no- I don't know what I sound like right now. I might- I've probably been talking so loud

1346
06:01:02,709 --> 06:01:09,189
this whole playthrough because I can't hear anything. There's a vacuum cleaner going behind me

1347
06:01:09,189 --> 06:01:23,430
and in front of me and on both sides of my ears. It has not been easy, but you made it into the-

1348
06:01:23,430 --> 06:01:31,619
what is this? You have fought- am I Jesus? You've fought well, Jesus. Most important thing.

1349
06:01:32,259 --> 06:01:34,419
Coming up here. It's still left.

1350
06:01:39,509 --> 06:02:28,330
We're going upside down again. Hey, stop doing that. We are reaching the end of time.

1351
06:02:38,439 --> 06:02:46,779
Okay. Okay. Can somebody press the tracking button on the remote, please?

1352
06:02:47,580 --> 06:03:21,240
I'm trying to watch The Simpsons from 1990 fucking 3. Give me something to shoot at him.

1353
06:03:21,240 --> 06:03:41,209
What the fuck? Will you behave? I don't know. Give me a bow and arrow to shoot at him, please.

1354
06:03:55,029 --> 06:04:22,409
Am I the Big Bang or something? My planet? Farewell. Thanks.

1355
06:04:24,259 --> 06:04:36,330
Oh my god. What are you doing, game? When you're out of luck and you're out of friends,

1356
06:04:38,090 --> 06:05:33,990
let me be the one to show you. So long. It's still going? Is this- am I getting looped?

1357
06:05:33,990 --> 06:05:59,779
Am I getting pitied? Oh shit. Don't lose now. Stop shaking the screen. Stop doing this.

1358
06:06:00,419 --> 06:06:26,840
Please, I can't see anything. Oh my god. Bro. Bro. Bro. Bro. Come on, bro. Dude, what the fuck?

1359
06:06:26,840 --> 06:06:37,900
I can't even like see anymore. I literally can't even see. Somebody's just screaming into my brain.

1360
06:06:39,340 --> 06:06:52,549
It's like- it's like somebody hitting me in the back of the head with a hammer every 10 seconds.

1361
06:07:04,060 --> 06:07:06,700
There are wow raid bosses that are not as long as this.

1362
06:07:07,500 --> 06:07:13,400
I remember like Ragnaros took like 40 minutes. I don't want to re- I don't want to do that again.

1363
06:07:14,200 --> 06:07:28,069
All right. I got it. I got it. I got it. I'm good. I'm good.

1364
06:08:04,279 --> 06:08:52,419
I don't want to see it anymore. No. Stop it.

1365
06:08:53,299 --> 06:09:06,970
Stop. Dude, I want to do that. It's- oh my god. Hey. Hey, you want to do this again

1366
06:09:06,970 --> 06:09:11,689
for another five straight fucking minutes? Stay strong. Stay determined.

1367
06:09:12,729 --> 06:09:17,130
Fly into me. Fly out of me. Because you're a baby and you're about to be in the universe.

1368
06:09:17,130 --> 06:09:23,240
I don't know whatever the fuck this is. Put it on easy just to see the end of the game.

1369
06:09:31,000 --> 06:09:35,159
My face is itchy. I'm losing my mind. All right. Wait. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. I got it.

1370
06:09:35,799 --> 06:10:13,299
Stop. All right. If I make another sound after this, I'm going to gift a thousand subs

1371
06:10:15,290 --> 06:14:08,659
until the end of the fight. Okay. Starting now. I can talk. Okay. I did it. I almost screamed when

1372
06:14:08,659 --> 06:14:18,819
it just did that. What happened? Where am I? When it did that second part right there,

1373
06:14:18,819 --> 06:14:23,060
when it just threw a bunch of- I almost screamed, but I was like, oh my god, I can't scream.

1374
06:14:23,060 --> 06:14:40,060
Am I dead? What am I? And you fart directly in- I'm not going to even say anything because

1375
06:14:40,060 --> 06:14:49,000
why do I read those? Do not worry. You have done well. This is the end of this life. Before we

1376
06:14:49,000 --> 06:15:17,479
venture forward, I have something to show you. It's going to be earth. I created earth. You're

1377
06:15:17,479 --> 06:15:28,709
awake. You did it. Apparently I did it. You freed everyone from the immortal realm. Welcome to the

1378
06:15:28,709 --> 06:15:36,470
waiting room. This is the place of reconciliation, the place after death and the end of the game.

1379
06:15:41,430 --> 06:15:49,860
This was the good end. It's been an absolute joyful experience to see you on this journey.

1380
06:15:50,419 --> 06:16:09,930
Some have waited for you here. Okay. This is the good ending. I actually was supposed to do this.

1381
06:16:09,930 --> 06:16:15,130
Look. Thank you for freeing me. You're truly a great warrior, but this world still has secrets

1382
06:16:15,130 --> 06:16:24,729
left to uncover. I've lost everything. The world doesn't exist. I'm not really me anymore. All these

1383
06:16:24,729 --> 06:16:34,860
things I used to care about, they don't matter. In a strange way, I feel relieved. I believe there

1384
06:16:34,860 --> 06:16:39,340
was another world after death. I thought everything would just stop and turn black for all eternity.

1385
06:16:39,979 --> 06:16:46,119
Maybe an eternity has already passed. I don't even know anymore. I'm glad it seems there is

1386
06:16:46,119 --> 06:16:55,349
more to life than what I thought. I feel stupid. I thought we were already in the afterlife,

1387
06:16:55,349 --> 06:16:59,990
but I'm happy there's another journey coming. I'm a bit sad that I've been quite accustomed to my

1388
06:16:59,990 --> 06:17:06,229
body. Existed for eons, maybe some change is good. It must have been hard for you to kill everyone.

1389
06:17:06,790 --> 06:17:16,060
I'm glad you took the role of Reaper. Here comes the birth canal. I'm telling you. Sometimes when

1390
06:17:16,060 --> 06:17:21,479
it gets really quiet, I hear a voice. I can't decide whether it's nice or some whatever. I have

1391
06:17:21,479 --> 06:17:27,659
a nice journey. Everyone's getting birthed. I knew you had it in you. It gives me great pleasure that

1392
06:17:27,659 --> 06:17:34,310
you were able to free the souls, including his by the way. Everyone did that D face when I did it to

1393
06:17:34,310 --> 06:17:46,360
him. Look what I did. Wait, why are you not going? You had a reason for coming here, didn't you?

1394
06:17:47,990 --> 06:17:52,580
As we are ending our chapter, I have a strange feeling there is more to this world.

1395
06:17:56,599 --> 06:18:02,150
Across to the other realm, I see. It will be a pleasure showing you this world, Red. Unfortunately

1396
06:18:02,150 --> 06:18:07,189
for you, human, you will not be joining us tonight. But don't worry. Your time will come soon enough.

1397
06:18:07,189 --> 06:18:17,270
Goodbye. You've done well. What a strange place you have brought me to. Kill them all again.

1398
06:18:19,029 --> 06:18:22,790
You did well, human. The inhabitants had been there a long time. It's great to finally see

1399
06:18:22,790 --> 06:18:28,869
them come back. As for you, Pink, I hope you understood what needed to be done. It was a

1400
06:18:28,869 --> 06:18:33,270
hard path, something no one should be forced to do. It is not good for the soul to be immortal.

1401
06:18:33,270 --> 06:18:48,090
You need to come home. Yeah, so it seems. Hi, guys. I was shocked with everything that happened,

1402
06:18:48,090 --> 06:18:51,450
but I'm happy with how it all turned out. I think Flan is happiest of us all.

1403
06:18:56,330 --> 06:19:00,090
You, Red? You've changed quite a bit. How long has it been since we saw each other?

1404
06:19:02,250 --> 06:19:11,349
I can't tell. I know we didn't leave on good terms, but I wanted to let you know that I'm

1405
06:19:11,349 --> 06:19:16,810
thankful for what you did. Grim is ready for it to end when he stops doing voices.

1406
06:19:20,520 --> 06:19:26,900
Yeah, if you're new to the channel, hour number like one, two, and three is like, oh, that's me,

1407
06:19:26,900 --> 06:19:31,619
Germa. Oh, hey, that's me. I had a great life and lots of friends. When you get to hour number four

1408
06:19:31,619 --> 06:19:37,849
and five and then six and so on, it's like, here, I'm just just me. We're just hanging out.

1409
06:19:37,849 --> 06:19:43,189
You can feel the energy levels like sap from my body. I've had a great life with lots of

1410
06:19:43,189 --> 06:19:48,299
friends and fun, but when I was alone, I didn't have such a great time. Anyway, happy you helped

1411
06:19:48,299 --> 06:19:55,860
me. Yeah, end of the stream voice. That's how you can tell. Do we have to send everybody or?

1412
06:19:58,330 --> 06:20:06,630
I did a good job looking forward to reward. This is it, huh? What was the point of that?

1413
06:20:07,189 --> 06:20:18,389
I got some thinking to do, Red or whoever you really are. Red, hi, Blue. I'm so happy to see

1414
06:20:18,389 --> 06:20:22,869
you again. Once I died, it felt very cold and everything became dark and it got a bit scary.

1415
06:20:23,509 --> 06:20:26,709
But after a while, that frightful feeling disappeared. And when I opened my eyes,

1416
06:20:26,709 --> 06:20:36,650
I was here. I knew you weren't a bad guy. All these people are respawning in the freezer.

1417
06:20:39,189 --> 06:20:42,869
Oh, we're going over. Oh, I didn't know I was an immortal. He's sending us over.

1418
06:20:43,509 --> 06:20:51,939
He's sending us over to the next realm. I didn't know I was an immortal. Knowing that there is

1419
06:20:51,939 --> 06:21:08,919
more. You still have like a cold up here. Send them to the birth canal. I wonder where we will

1420
06:21:08,919 --> 06:21:13,639
appear now. Are they going to like appear as like animals and humans and like bugs and stuff?

1421
06:21:15,669 --> 06:21:22,419
How do I know that I'm not just like having them reincarnate as like a beetle? I couldn't believe

1422
06:21:22,419 --> 06:21:27,189
that there was more to it all. I'm so thrilled. I assume the world would just cease to exist.

1423
06:21:29,369 --> 06:21:41,349
And then nothing, you know, this is truly astonishing. I never got the chance to truly

1424
06:21:41,349 --> 06:21:45,909
meet you for so many years. No, for so many decades, I've been living in a world of terror.

1425
06:21:46,470 --> 06:21:51,740
I was held prisoner by Professor Orange. They gave me things so I wouldn't couldn't leave.

1426
06:21:52,380 --> 06:21:57,180
I'm just happy it's all over now. But I do feel regret regret that I didn't take it into my own

1427
06:21:57,180 --> 06:22:05,479
hands and free myself from Professor Orange. I just gathered courage. I don't know. Still,

1428
06:22:05,479 --> 06:22:23,349
I'm very happy I'm finally free now. I am thankful. I was hurt. You. You helped me.

1429
06:22:23,349 --> 06:22:31,209
Professor Orange. Not so nice. To me. All right, so we're sending this guy to hell, right?

1430
06:22:33,669 --> 06:22:37,029
Had theories about there being additional layers of consciousness after death.

1431
06:22:37,830 --> 06:22:42,150
The rationalist and materialist in me couldn't let myself truly indulge in that fantasy.

1432
06:22:42,150 --> 06:22:46,709
In any case, I'm glad that there is a light beyond death. I'm sorry for my actions of malice

1433
06:22:46,709 --> 06:22:58,700
against you. I was technically sent to hell. Anybody else down here? We got everybody down here?

1434
06:22:58,700 --> 06:23:16,250
What about the street lamp? Okay. Thank you for everything. Do you want to save? Yes. Right here.

1435
06:23:16,650 --> 06:23:32,919
Amazing. Okay. I'm going to save your progress. No. I can't kill him. All right. Only a few more

1436
06:23:32,919 --> 06:23:51,340
people up here. I think this is it. Who's that? A Roblox character? This whole game was made in

1437
06:23:51,340 --> 06:24:02,169
Roblox? You did well. You can finally know peace. It wouldn't have been possible without you.

1438
06:24:02,810 --> 06:24:10,500
Seems like a good place for a fresh start. You can call me Bridge. Oh wait.

1439
06:24:11,580 --> 06:24:15,659
Honby. When you killed me, I was like, this is where it all ends. But then I didn't.

1440
06:24:15,659 --> 06:24:23,340
I'm ready for something new. I will be honest with you, Pink. I never expected the afterlife

1441
06:24:23,340 --> 06:24:29,340
would look like this. It's been nice, but I do feel a bit sad. Are you sad? No. I have a heart of

1442
06:24:29,340 --> 06:24:34,650
stone, you know. Maybe that's how you were able to do it all. And we're just, we're sending them

1443
06:24:34,650 --> 06:24:40,119
over in their essences and energies. We're going to fire a laser and blow up a planet. That's like

1444
06:24:40,119 --> 06:24:49,779
why we did this whole thing was for that. Bye. Get out of here. I'm sorry. He didn't leave. I'm

1445
06:24:49,779 --> 06:24:54,759
sorry for attacking pink. I thought I did the right thing. It's both exciting and a bit, uh,

1446
06:24:55,400 --> 06:25:01,659
whatever that word is, it starts with an M and ends in ellencolic. Oh, melancholic, like melancholy.

1447
06:25:02,380 --> 06:25:06,540
We're going to leave this realm. I've lived for so long that I feel like there's so much more for

1448
06:25:06,540 --> 06:25:13,220
me to discover. Thank you for all the good times, Pink. Thank you, Ross the Beast. You're always

1449
06:25:13,220 --> 06:25:22,500
looking out for me. You need to get out of here. All right, nothing gets past you. All right,

1450
06:25:23,299 --> 06:25:41,700
gotta be gone. All right, we cleared it out. Nobody left. Put everybody on. Now it's time.

1451
06:25:42,419 --> 06:25:50,150
Hello, human. Are you ready to end the game? Yes. It's been a spectacle watching you.

1452
06:25:50,790 --> 06:25:59,720
Let us say farewell in a way it deserves to end. God, more. Do I have to fight God now?

1453
06:26:01,990 --> 06:26:17,240
You kidding me? I don't want to fight God. I don't want to fight God. Everyone's leaving.

1454
06:26:18,040 --> 06:26:31,700
Am I going to try to hurt them or are we going to dance over the credits?

1455
06:26:32,419 --> 06:26:57,849
How come it's just those guys? I want the whole and I want the whole cast.

1456
06:27:25,750 --> 06:27:32,630
All right. All right, guys, guys, guys. Okay. I'm done. I'm done. I'm really tired.

1457
06:27:34,520 --> 06:27:38,680
Everyone go live your next life and ship. I don't want to do this anymore. I'm fucking tired.

1458
06:27:42,340 --> 06:27:49,319
You don't understand how long I've had to do this for. Goodbye, everybody. Goodbye. Goodbye.

1459
06:27:50,119 --> 06:27:57,220
Thanks. Thank you. I swear to God, I'm going to start throwing you outside the side of my window

1460
06:27:57,220 --> 06:28:12,060
like a fucking newspaper if you don't leave. Thank you. I hope you found this experience.

1461
06:28:12,060 --> 06:28:21,130
Let's try to kill me with that last chord. Oh, okay. Dick. Before we close the curtains,

1462
06:28:21,130 --> 06:28:28,869
I'd like to thank all the Kickstarter supporters and everyone on Patreon. I hope it does that.

1463
06:28:28,869 --> 06:28:40,340
Please do that. That would be fucking awesome. Let me dance over all the Kickstarter names.

1464
06:28:40,340 --> 06:28:57,130
Come on. Thanks for everything. Always to let me get out. Can't leave me alone.

1465
06:28:57,930 --> 06:29:21,799
I won't let me rest. Thanks to you, I can finally sleep. Yeah, that'd be great when I get to do that

1466
06:29:21,799 --> 06:29:29,540
too. You want room service? Anybody here want room service? Want to call Toshiers? Anybody need

1467
06:29:29,540 --> 06:29:41,849
anything? You're always sort of annoying. You know what? Send that guy to hell. Send that guy to

1468
06:29:41,849 --> 06:29:46,250
hell. I want that guy dead again. I want that guy to go back to the immortal world. I don't want to

1469
06:29:46,250 --> 06:29:56,419
give him eternal fucking beautiful life. Send that guy to hell. It's been a pleasure. Thank you.

1470
06:29:57,619 --> 06:30:08,439
Thank you for helping me. Yes. I'm so happy there's more. I'm just waiting for this to cut

1471
06:30:08,439 --> 06:30:15,880
and we're in a giant bus and we just go off a cliff. Oh, we're going to venture beyond the

1472
06:30:16,040 --> 06:30:23,259
and then it just cuts to like real. We go off like a fucking cliff and the car explodes.

1473
06:30:24,220 --> 06:31:10,650
That health bar is huge. That health bar is massive. It's so massive. Thank you for playing my game.

1474
06:31:10,650 --> 06:31:26,939
See you later. Please stop thanking me. Yeah, we did. One thank you is enough. I don't need to

1475
06:31:26,939 --> 06:31:38,569
hear more than one thank you. Here we are at the end of the road. We have witnessed an eventful

1476
06:31:38,569 --> 06:31:47,450
journey. Many words have been said. Thoughts have been shared. Before you leave, do you wish

1477
06:31:47,450 --> 06:31:59,400
to hear the last absolute truth? Sure. What is it? There are no absolute truths. Yes, there is.

1478
06:31:59,400 --> 06:32:05,610
Chocolate is delicious. That's an absolute truth. Nobody can disagree with that. You're free to

1479
06:32:05,610 --> 06:32:15,209
wrap your half truths into whatever. No, that is the true beauty of it. You can make the rest up.

1480
06:32:15,209 --> 06:32:22,860
You still have a long time. No, that's not a good idea. That's not a good idea because that's how

1481
06:32:23,099 --> 06:32:30,220
Facebook and Twitter got so fucked up. No, no, no. Let's focus on truth, please.

1482
06:32:30,220 --> 06:32:42,250
You still have a time left and some time after that. Oh yeah, the thing about truth is you just

1483
06:32:42,250 --> 06:32:55,000
make a bunch of shit up. Who cares? Who cares about that truth stuff? I'm not going to skip

1484
06:32:55,000 --> 06:33:07,689
the credits. That's not what it means. There's no Facebook dude in heaven. Oh, how do you know that?

1485
06:33:07,689 --> 06:33:11,130
You don't know that. You don't know what it is. You don't even know what it looks like.

1486
06:33:11,770 --> 06:33:24,869
You want the alien rant again? Take care of yourself. Thank you, friend. What the fuck is

1487
06:33:24,869 --> 06:33:47,990
happening? Come and visit us again. It never ends in everhood. New game plus.

1488
06:34:01,259 --> 06:34:05,580
All right, I'm going to give you my full my opinion. Played through the whole game. Took

1489
06:34:05,580 --> 06:34:16,139
about seven and a half hours. I tell you, I believe that that was very solid. I would say

1490
06:34:16,139 --> 06:34:23,049
that was a highly recommend. It's very good. It was definitely worth playing for sure.

1491
06:34:29,939 --> 06:34:49,419
That was very good. What would you give? What about a rating? New game plus for the good ending.

1492
06:34:49,419 --> 06:34:59,610
I don't think so. Game grew on me a lot after I beat it and thought about it more. Please write

1493
06:34:59,610 --> 06:35:03,380
to us and tell us how our game made you feel. Our email is in the store page. I'll tell you right

1494
06:35:03,380 --> 06:35:09,770
now. It made me feel I had a lot of emotions. It made me feel all kinds of things like what is

1495
06:35:09,770 --> 06:35:20,040
life? What is death? This game contains flashing lights that can be dangerous. No, it's very good.

1496
06:35:20,040 --> 06:35:42,680
But this is this is now looks different. What happened? Oh, you can replay battles. That's

1497
06:35:42,680 --> 06:35:54,069
cool. All right, I think I'm going to call it here. That was really good. Now I understand

1498
06:35:54,069 --> 06:35:57,990
why everybody said, dude, don't just play the don't just like drink half a bottle of wine and

1499
06:35:57,990 --> 06:36:03,930
play like the first level. I get it. That was a that was a very, very fantastic time. I had a

1500
06:36:03,930 --> 06:36:16,580
great time. Hope you did too. The next time that you see me live, I will see you on the 20th of

1501
06:36:16,580 --> 06:36:20,180
the next four or five days. I've got a lot of stuff I need to do, a lot of work to do,

1502
06:36:21,860 --> 06:36:30,229
especially on the big stream that's happening on the 1st of February. A lot of stuff to do.

1503
06:36:30,229 --> 06:36:37,479
On the 20th, that's Thursday, we're going to play Hitman VR. It releases on the 20th. I'm

1504
06:36:37,479 --> 06:36:52,549
very excited for that. I feel like that's going to be a lot of fun. And I will see you guys later.

1505
06:36:52,549 --> 06:37:00,619
He's stalling? The stream is over, man. But yeah, Hitman VR will be the 20th. I'm assuming I'll

1506
06:37:01,180 --> 06:37:05,619
here's one thing I want to make really clear about the VR streams is because the last time

1507
06:37:05,619 --> 06:37:09,860
I did VR, I kind of really had a lot of trouble and a lot of problems afterwards.

1508
06:37:09,860 --> 06:37:15,430
So what's going to happen with those streams is I'm probably only going to be in the headset

1509
06:37:15,430 --> 06:37:21,669
for like maybe two or three hours each time. I just physically can't do more than like three,

1510
06:37:21,669 --> 06:37:28,139
four hours in the headset. I just can't. So yeah, for those of you that don't know,

1511
06:37:28,139 --> 06:37:38,790
I have some medical issues with my chest and back. Even seated VR probably would be too much.

1512
06:37:38,790 --> 06:37:43,860
Yeah, probably two or three hours. Maybe I'll push it a little more past three if I'm having

1513
06:37:43,860 --> 06:37:50,979
a great time. But the 20th, we'll do it again. Maybe on like the 22nd or something, 23rd,

1514
06:37:50,979 --> 06:37:57,139
24th. I will do it a few times in a row, but just not a whole lot of time in the headset in a row.

1515
06:37:57,139 --> 06:38:06,979
Like I'm in the same setting. It should be fun. I'm looking forward to it. You should go back to

1516
06:38:06,979 --> 06:38:16,139
Everett and try the pacifist run. Maybe I'll do that on my own time. But thanks for hanging out.

1517
06:38:16,139 --> 06:38:25,099
Hopefully you guys had a good time. And we'll see you again in four or five days on the 20th.

1518
06:38:25,180 --> 06:38:35,419
It's man time for that. Let's go. I'm going to say four o'clock Pacific. That might come back

1519
06:38:35,419 --> 06:38:40,569
to like two or three, depending on if I can get my sleep schedule in the right spot. But plan on four,

1520
06:38:40,569 --> 06:38:45,590
although it could be pulled back to like something as early as two or three. I really want to get

1521
06:38:45,590 --> 06:38:51,159
back on that like 2 p.m. Pacific schedule because it is right now pretty late for everybody,

1522
06:38:51,159 --> 06:39:03,340
not just East Coast. And that's it. Have a wonderful evening, everybody. Take care of

1523
06:39:03,340 --> 06:39:12,569
yourselves. You know, hey, do one good thing today. You know what I mean? Do something good

1524
06:39:12,569 --> 06:39:17,619
today. You know what I mean? So you can breathe in the air and breathe it out and go,

1525
06:39:17,619 --> 06:39:29,770
that feels good. I did something good. Do it. Just do it. Why not? Do it. No. Okay. Good night.

1526
06:39:29,770 --> 06:39:35,259
Well, yeah, it's too late. The day's over. Yeah. Never mind. Do it tomorrow. Do something nice

1527
06:39:35,259 --> 06:39:41,110
tomorrow for somebody. I don't know. Yeah. Forget about the rest of the day. Just, you know, you'll

1528
06:39:41,110 --> 06:39:52,900
be asleep. It's like negative 30 outside. I'm not going anywhere. Call your mother and say hi.

1529
06:39:52,900 --> 06:40:01,830
Mom, it's good to hear from you. I'll see you guys on Thursday. Take care. Have a good night. Goodbye.
