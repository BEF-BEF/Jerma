00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:04,839
Digital Monsters, Digital Monsters, Digital Monsters.

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:13,529
Hey guys, welcome back to another edition of Digital Monsters.

3
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:23,429
I'm your guide. The emote is here. Yep, I've been hanging out in chat for like an hour or so.

4
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:32,630
Popping in and out, just popping my head in here. I was gonna hold off

5
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:38,549
and have a few more come out this next week, but I decided, you know, whatever.

6
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:47,219
Just put it out. I think it looks pretty good.

7
00:00:52,859 --> 00:01:05,219
Ah, so today we're doing a extra stream. No, it's not even really extra.

8
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:13,980
Just another one in a row. Only had a small, you know, three to four hour, three and a half hour

9
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:22,180
stream on what was it now? A couple days ago. So I figured let's complete it and let's put,

10
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:28,230
you know, another three, four, five, six, however long. Just chill out with the MS-DOS

11
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:43,400
video game archive. There are 4,334 MS-DOS games on this website, first of all.

12
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:47,959
Second of all, it is you who will pick the games I will play.

13
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,989
Let's just make sure it works for the purpose of the stream.

14
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:59,959
Go ahead and start clicking on the screen. I want to make sure it still works

15
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:14,229
and it does, doesn't it? This is going to be a smart click stream. Now, is there a way?

16
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:22,580
All right, so do me a favor. Get like all four corners. You know, go like top left,

17
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:29,449
top right as far as you can go. Give me some corners here. All right, so top and top right

18
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,300
and top left work fine, but it's just not that bottom area. I wonder why that is.

19
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:41,750
There's nothing really I can change about it either. Should be okay though.

20
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:48,710
Get out your laptops, mobile users. Yeah, this should just be fun.

21
00:02:50,620 --> 00:03:01,479
Just wanted to do it. Sam and Max will return this coming week here.

22
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:08,939
Let me take a look at my calendar. It's like that because of the Twitch UI for full

23
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:18,060
screening. I see. I still remember you calling me an asshole yesterday. No, I was just

24
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:25,289
fucking around. I was a little hangry last night. I'm sorry. I was hungry and annoyed.

25
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:31,319
I was hangry. I was. Only at the very, very end though. I don't know. It just kind of

26
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:42,650
clicked in there. What happened? Nothing happened. I was just being, I was just,

27
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:48,340
I was irritated because I don't know. I got, I'm just a human, all right?

28
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:53,020
And sometimes you get irritated. Maybe you should eat some food,

29
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,139
asshole. See, somebody called me an asshole. I can't, what am I supposed to do?

30
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:16,100
No, I'm just kidding. No, no, no, no, no, no. Smart clicks work. To be fair chat can be,

31
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:22,680
no, all I did, I was responding. Somebody said that this stream today was going to,

32
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:30,100
was going to be a shitty idea. And I said, Hey, Hey, that's it. I didn't say anything else.

33
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:38,699
That was, that was it. It's a new day though. You know, if you give up a home run,

34
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:51,350
you don't think about that home run every single time you play. You gotta get struck out sometimes.

35
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,680
Well, the pitcher doesn't get struck out unless you're playing in the national league.

36
00:04:56,569 --> 00:05:00,579
Think about that home run. But all right, let's, uh, let's get going.

37
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:08,550
Just be funny. No, that's not forehead. No, it's not. Do not, no,

38
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,910
germapop is not intended to be used as a forehead. It's intended to be used as an

39
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:21,750
ice cream to eat and enjoy. Oh, great. So here, this is how it's going to work.

40
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:27,509
Let me turn off this for a second here. Will we get in a minute? Okay. So let me make sure

41
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:36,490
this is on correctly. It should be. And as you see here, would you look at that? Here are

42
00:05:37,529 --> 00:05:47,370
some of the thousands of video games that are on here. So very important. First little tidbit

43
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:58,310
of information here is the reason why it looks like this is because this area here is if you

44
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:06,860
want me to scroll. This is the archive. From my understanding, and this was a recommendation,

45
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:12,420
by the way, from my understanding, all this stuff is like abandoned vaporware on like the

46
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:22,089
archive website. It's on like archive.org. I think this is, this is all like kind of

47
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:29,240
shit that doesn't, like doesn't exist anymore. How about this? Anything that's like still

48
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:35,769
copywritten, I won't play. So, okay, here's your criteria. Everyone gets to pick. You guys

49
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:43,610
get to pick what I do today. No copyright stuff, no porn games, no games that are rated R,

50
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:48,810
no games that require anything to do with a mouse, and no games that have loud sounds.

51
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:55,540
So you've got to pick wisely here because I don't want to get in trouble. So out of

52
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:02,490
this four level, how many? 4,000, this 4,334, you probably have a choice of between like

53
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:10,060
maybe 40 different games. But the reason why this is down here is because I'm going to

54
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:14,939
just start at the top here. And by the way, I get full veto. So if you're going to want

55
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:20,060
me to play like Sim City illegally, I'm going to have to veto that one. I'm just going to

56
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:25,180
have to do that. If you want me to play, for instance, Stunts, I'm going to have to veto

57
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:33,750
that one too. This is copyrighted. I'm just kidding. It's not illegal. It's very illegal.

58
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:39,000
Because I don't want to be like on an illegal stream. Any Twitch staff in here?

59
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:49,610
Any Twitch staff in here that tell me this is like illegal? This is all puppetsarchive.org.

60
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:59,939
You got like Aladdin. Oh, well, the new movie's coming out, right? It's a game library. Yeah,

61
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:06,259
it's at archive.org public game library. Well, let's put it this way. If like Twitch

62
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:11,060
staff comes in here and says, get out of here, I'll be like, all right, man.

63
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:16,490
And then we'll pack it up and go to a different streaming website for like an hour.

64
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:25,740
I'm kidding. That's a joke. Don't, nobody hold that on me. All right. So remember if

65
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,540
you let's get started. If you want me to scroll, it's an infinite scroll, by the way.

66
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:38,710
This is already off limits. I'm not going to play a porn game. So don't click that one.

67
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:47,220
Here we go. Please click on the thing if you want me to scroll down. And by the way,

68
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:55,019
a scroll down means all of it. I'm scrolling down here. So if you want that scroll,

69
00:08:55,019 --> 00:09:04,500
you better know that's what you want. You know how this is going to end. Not yet. I don't.

70
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:11,269
Please click the screen on the thing you'd like me to play. All right. Already vetoed the porn

71
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:28,570
game. It's not porn. It's a porn game. This game starts off at porn. It's a porn start.

72
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:34,299
It's a porn start. It really isn't. I don't know. It could be a porn game.

73
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:45,539
Can you guys not click over here? You should be able to click on the right side.

74
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:54,700
No, you can't. I'm getting baited. Yeah. See, if you want me to scroll,

75
00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:01,500
you click over there. Make sure you click on the same spot because I have to do addition.

76
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,889
All right. So now that we know the rules, now that you know the rules, we're going to do it.

77
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:13,720
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, slow down. Add an arrow icon. All right. Yeah,

78
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,580
that's a good idea. You know, when people just think of good ideas, I love it. So let's add

79
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:26,980
like a down arrow that you have to click on. Well, I'm just going to put like a circle

80
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:34,899
or something. Look, how about I just put the popsicle up there. Put a down vote. No,

81
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:51,159
no, no. All right. If you want to scroll, click on the pop, the new emote. This is where you need

82
00:10:51,159 --> 00:11:02,889
to click if you want to scroll down. All right. Here we go. And play elevator music. That's too

83
00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:14,919
much for me. How are new viewers going to know that? They, you know what? They won't.

84
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:22,600
You're right. I'm still lost. Wait, why is it covering up the, hold on a second. There we go.

85
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:30,009
Okay. You want me to scroll? No, everybody just clicked it because I put the face up

86
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:37,669
there. You don't actually want me to scroll. It's just, it's just like bugs to a light.

87
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:58,090
It's like, oh shit, click a face. Only click once. We want ice cream. Oh shit. At least

88
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:09,220
the bug lights are working. Well, it looks like we're going to do the Oregon trail.

89
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,620
And I kind of knew that was going to be what we were going to do at first.

90
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:24,200
I figured that's what we were going to do. Oregon trail it is. So here we go. Let's do

91
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:31,419
the Oregon trail. It might be loud and I apologize in advance if it is. Here we go.

92
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:43,259
Don't worry. I've got it set up so I can do this. Hey, should I gotta get the image off

93
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:50,250
the screen? No fuck. I can't get them off the screen. All right. Here we go.

94
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:59,019
I'll copyright 1990. I'm fucked. Just keep, I have to keep them there for the first month.

95
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:03,750
You may travel the trail, learn about the trail, see the Oregon top 10, turn sound off,

96
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,269
choose management option. What is N? What is your option? Choose the trail. Travel the trail.

97
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:15,799
So how many, many kinds of people made the trip to Oregon. You may be a banker from Boston.

98
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:21,779
Yeah, I mean that's the easy one though. These are difficulty settings. Be a carpenter

99
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:26,820
from Ohio. Be a farmer from Illinois. Find out the differences between these choices. I

100
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,820
know that the banker just gets the most money and I gotta be, it says Boston. I have to

101
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:41,220
click it. What is the first name of the wagon leader? What are the first names of the

102
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:54,759
four other members in your party? All the people that are like in this house.

103
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:10,179
Did you get my multiple split personality? My roommate, my girlfriend, and my dog. Yeah,

104
00:14:10,179 --> 00:14:26,549
these are correct. Do you sleep with Jax in the same bed? Yes, it's me. It is 1848.

105
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:32,629
Your jumping off place for Oregon is Independence, Missouri. You must decide which month to

106
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:39,350
leave Independence. It's gonna be too hot in July. It'll be a little too rainy for me in April.

107
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:47,480
May bugs come out. We're going in March. Before leaving Independence, you should buy equipment

108
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:53,000
and supplies. You have 1600 bits in cash, but you don't have to spend it all now.

109
00:14:53,559 --> 00:15:01,210
Okay, 1600 bucks. You can buy whatever you need at Matt's General Store. Hello, I'm Matt.

110
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:05,610
So you're going to Oregon. I can fix you up with what you need. A team of oxen to pull

111
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:12,070
your wagon. Clothing for both summer and winter. Excellent. Plenty of food for the trip. Ammunition

112
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:18,200
for your rifles and spare parts for your wagon. Matt's General Store. Okay, oxen. Total bill

113
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:24,460
zero. Amount you have. Which item would you like to buy? I eat a lot, so let's make sure

114
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:30,330
we get some food here. I recommend you take at least 200 pounds of food for each person

115
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:34,730
in your family. I see that you have five people in all. You'll need flour, sugar,

116
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:39,049
bacon, and coffee. My price is 20 cents a pound. How many pounds of food do you want?

117
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:46,950
Oh, god damn it. This is one of those math problems. If Judy eats 400 pounds of bacon

118
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:54,379
and Kim eats 200 pounds of sugar, how many pounds of bacon will it take to make one

119
00:15:54,379 --> 00:16:03,100
bag of flour? I don't fucking know. Let's go with like 5,000 pounds. No, how many? Two, four,

120
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:09,659
six, eight, a thousand? I eat a lot. I eat like, okay, I eat like six times a day.

121
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:17,690
You wonder why I get so hangry. My body is just burning calories constantly. I can't stop it,

122
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:25,879
no matter what I do. When I'm lying in bed, my body is just like 400 degrees. Kim will roll

123
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:31,320
over to me and be like, god, you are like a fireball. And I'm just like sweating like, what?

124
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,440
Oh, sorry. And I'll turn over and Jax will be on the other side and he'll be like,

125
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,000
I don't see the problem. I think you're a little cold actually. Because he's like

126
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:54,259
30,000 degrees hotter than I am. So, okay, we need a thousand pounds. But I eat more,

127
00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:59,700
so I'm gonna get 1200 pounds. Like, I eat for two, you know, like a pregnant guy.

128
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:11,769
Food, 200, total bill 240. Oxen. There are two oxen in a yolk. I recommend at least three

129
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:18,250
yolk. I charge $40 a yolk. See, it's doing, this is like children's math. Okay, I need

130
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:30,920
three, so two, four, six, six oxens. How many yolk do you want? More, right? Anytime you

131
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:38,680
recommend, I want four. Four or five? I'm gonna do five. Clothing. You'll need warm clothing

132
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,440
in the mountains. I recommend taking at least two sets of each clothes per person.

133
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:49,910
Each set is 10 bucks. I don't trust this matte person. Why? Because he looks like

134
00:17:49,910 --> 00:18:00,059
the old version of the ice cream that is on the screen right now. I mean, that's weird,

135
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:18,940
I guess. Because he vapes. That's a pipe. You're getting scammed. I'm not getting scammed yet. I

136
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:23,579
haven't signed the check. Okay, you need warm clothes in the mountains. I recommend taking

137
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:31,299
at least two sets of clothes per person. So, 10 sets of clothes. Let's go with 12 sets of

138
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:39,319
clothes. I'm a banker. I got a lot of money. Okay, ammunition. I sell ammunition in boxes of

139
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:43,480
20 bullets. Each box costs two bucks. How many boxes do you want? A lot. Because you

140
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:55,880
have to like shoot squirrels and stuff and bugs. I'm gonna say like five boxes. Okay,

141
00:18:56,839 --> 00:19:05,900
maybe try to get more than that. Hold on. That was only 10 bucks. I want 10 boxes. Okay,

142
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:10,440
spare parts. It's a good idea to have a few spare parts for your wagon. Here are the

143
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,420
prices. Wagon wheel, wagon axle, wagon tongue. You have a lot more money. Yeah,

144
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:20,420
because I need to invest it. I don't want to spend every single cent that I own. It's all

145
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,940
the money that I have. I want to invest it into fucking, I don't know, I'm gonna put like

146
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:33,299
a call option on Tesla to expire. Hopefully, hopefully in the money in like two or three

147
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:43,859
weeks. I'm an investment. I'm playing the part. What do you come on? All right, I want

148
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:50,630
how many wagon wheels do you want? I want 12. No, that's too many. Wagon wheel. It's

149
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:57,289
a good idea to have a few spare parts. A few. Five. Your wagon may only carry three

150
00:19:57,289 --> 00:20:05,099
wagon wheels. That's bullshit. I got 500 bucks. I want another wagon. Buy another wagon.

151
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,559
Three. Can I do five axles? All right, what was gonna do the max? Three, three, three.

152
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:18,099
Total bill. Okay, I have like a thousand dollars left. Should I buy more? Should I buy more

153
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:28,470
animals? The wagon has too much stuff. Everyone's gonna have to walk. All right,

154
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:33,960
I'm gonna buy some more. I'm gonna buy five more of oxen. No, no, no, no, no. Okay,

155
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:45,660
that's not adding. That's total. I'm gonna six yolks. Ammo. How many boxes do I want?

156
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:55,269
Let's go with like 20 boxes. More than that. Let's go with 100 boxes. It can't

157
00:20:55,269 --> 00:21:02,380
even count that high. 50 boxes. All right, now what about clothes? Maybe some extra

158
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:18,460
clothes. Um, 10. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Um, 20. That's less. Oxen. All right,

159
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:25,960
how about like 20? 15. 15. It won't let me buy more. I can only do single digits.

160
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:42,819
Eight. There we go. I think we're good to go. More food. No, I don't need more food.

161
00:21:42,819 --> 00:21:48,019
How many pounds was it? 2,000 pounds. All right, that's 2,000 pounds of food.

162
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:58,680
More ammo. More ammo. All right, I'm gonna say 75 boxes. More clothes. I guess I'll do a couple

163
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:15,079
more clothes. 30? Less oxen. Okay, I guess I'll. Well then, you're ready to start. Good luck.

164
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:21,460
You have a long and difficult journey ahead of you. Okay. I knew there was sounds. That's

165
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:28,339
very, that's very loud for me. Hope it's not loud for you. Uh, independent. March 1st,

166
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:37,529
1848. Which one of them is me? Oh, look, there's Otto. Oh, like, I know what you guys are gonna

167
00:22:37,529 --> 00:23:04,140
say. It's cold. Health good. Pace steady. Rations filling. You may continue on trail.

168
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:08,380
Check supplies. Look at the map. Change pace. Stop to rest. Let's just go on the trail.

169
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:18,819
Talk to people. Let's go. From Independence, it is 102 miles to the Kansas River crossing date.

170
00:23:18,819 --> 00:23:23,779
It's cold. Let's go. Press enter to size up the situation. What do you mean,

171
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:29,339
size up the situation? What are we talking about, like MTV's? It wasn't gonna knock me

172
00:23:29,339 --> 00:23:32,059
out? Size them up? You wanna come, you wanna come, come at me? You wanna come at me?

173
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:36,730
Situation? That was pretty good. I liked that one. I don't care if you didn't. I liked it.

174
00:23:38,329 --> 00:23:42,170
Press enter to size up the situation. Severe blizzard. Lose one day.

175
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:58,309
Hmm. What do we got for supplies? 16 oxen. 1,500 bullets. How do we already eat 50 pounds of food

176
00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:13,529
in one day? We're good. Cold. Health good. Food. Severe blizzard. Lose a day. Go. What I used

177
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:18,009
to do in math class is I would change it to the fastest you could possibly run and skip

178
00:24:18,009 --> 00:24:23,670
every single scenario and I could never get to the end and I never knew why. Press enter the

179
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:29,829
size it up a little bit. Rations, filling. Let's, hold on. No, no, no. No, everyone's not just

180
00:24:29,829 --> 00:24:34,309
gonna eat and fucking scrape a bunch of potatoes and carrots into the trash. That's not gonna

181
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:41,799
happen. Okay, filling meals are large and generous. No. Meals are small but adequate.

182
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:53,579
Let's go with two. Okay, change pace. A grueling pace. I always love to do grueling

183
00:24:53,579 --> 00:25:03,029
pace. Only for like a few minutes though. Not that long. All right, let's go continue on

184
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:15,240
the trail. Snowbound. Lose nine days. Did we go, is it an avalanche? Go. You are now at the

185
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:32,019
Kansas River crossing. Would you like to look around? Yes. I can't do this one. Sorry. It's

186
00:25:32,019 --> 00:25:43,589
pretty nice. All right, Kansas River crossing. Talk to people. Is anybody around? A stranger

187
00:25:43,589 --> 00:25:50,150
tells you, can't afford to take a ferry. We're making our wagon into a boat. We'll turn it

188
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:56,710
over, cock the bottom and sides with pitch and use it to float our goods across. After swim the

189
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:10,039
animals. Hope it don't rain. The river's high enough. Okay. Anybody to trade with. You meet

190
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:16,680
another emigrant who wants one set of clothing. He will trade you 76 bullets. Are you willing

191
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:31,240
to trade? No. 76 bullets. That's bad. Let me check the supplies. We're good. I got plenty

192
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:37,339
of food. I got some money. Let's continue on the trail. You must cross the river in order to

193
00:26:37,339 --> 00:26:43,980
continue. The river at this point is currently 613 feet across and 2.8 feet deep in the middle.

194
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:51,990
All right, so it's almost three feet deep and it's 600 feet. Three feet deep. It's cold

195
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:56,230
though. You may attempt to ford the river. Cock the wagon and float it across. Take a

196
00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:00,230
ferry across. Wait to see if conditions improve. Get more information. We're gonna take a ferry.

197
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:04,230
Take the ferry. The ferry operator says that he will charge you five dollars

198
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:12,380
and you'll have to wait four days. Five dollars. That's it? Are you serious? Pay the premium

199
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:26,859
every time. That's five bucks. Oh yes, we're going. Look at all them swimming over there.

200
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:34,339
Hey, sorry. We're just trying to go the speed limit over here.

201
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:41,450
Get me more cigarettes and coffee and chocolate on my fucking massive

202
00:27:41,450 --> 00:28:05,160
mansion boat. There's only six football fields. He's rich. Who's the guy on the right?

203
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,180
I forgot he was there. All right, from the Kansas River it is 82 miles to the big blue

204
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:24,089
river crossing. Health good. Weather warm. Food plenty of food. Grueling. We're good.

205
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:29,819
Everything's fine. You are now at the big blue river crossing. Would you like to look around?

206
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:48,119
Yeah, let's get another song. Um, ma'am, I'm not entirely sure. As a doctor that's been in this

207
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:53,990
field for over 35 years, we've never had somebody hooked up to a machine

208
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:57,670
we thought was gonna die real soon and then this shit started happening.

209
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:04,119
Just gotta get your camera out and Snapchat it. This is unbelievable.

210
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:22,740
So we got check supplies. Let's see how we're doing. Snapchat is the most boomer thing

211
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:27,779
you've ever said. Why? You guys don't like Snapchat? I haven't used it in a while.

212
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:33,289
All right, we're good. Uh, I would like to continue on the trail. Everyone's fine.

213
00:29:34,009 --> 00:29:38,250
You must cross the river in order to continue. The river is at this point is currently 248 feet

214
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:50,539
across and five feet deep in the middle. Uh, I would attempt. Where's the ferry? I can't pay.

215
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:54,549
I don't, I don't want to go in there. Excuse me, I don't want to go in the water.

216
00:29:56,039 --> 00:30:01,140
No, my things will get wet. Where's the ferry? Excuse me, ferry to take me across?

217
00:30:01,779 --> 00:30:06,569
And this is the part of the TV show or the movie where all the people I laughed at

218
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,819
are walking by me now and are looking and like scoffing like,

219
00:30:12,259 --> 00:30:15,700
he's got to do it this way now. And I'm like, no, I can't. I don't think I can.

220
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:32,549
Uh, how much is, let's see. He's role playing in the Oregon trail. Yes, I am.

221
00:30:32,549 --> 00:30:35,829
I'm not going to forward the river. We're going to cock the wagon and float across.

222
00:30:38,009 --> 00:30:40,809
We're going to turn into like fucking bread box.

223
00:30:40,970 --> 00:31:08,410
No. Okay. I'm dead. The way I get tipped over while floating, you lose 25 sets of clothing.

224
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:13,059
What did I have all the shirts on? Three, well, all right, hold on a minute. This doesn't

225
00:31:13,059 --> 00:31:18,170
make any sense. Was I just hoarding all the t-shirts? Would I do it in like a t-shirt

226
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:22,119
challenge video? And then the fucking boat tipped over?

227
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:38,950
That's why I drowned in four foot deep water. It wasn't even, no, it was less than that. It

228
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:46,009
was like four, it was like three and a half. I was way down by cinder blocks apparently. Okay.

229
00:31:46,809 --> 00:31:50,970
Whatever. I don't need to be alive as long as one of me is alive. I don't care.

230
00:31:52,299 --> 00:31:59,450
Oh, that's unfucking believable. All right. It's 118 miles to Fort Kearney. Let's go.

231
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:04,250
Lose trail. See, no, you don't have me here. So I was good at navigating.

232
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:07,960
All right. Let's, people can eat now because I eat way too much.

233
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:12,569
So now I can increase the food because I'm not around to eat at all

234
00:32:12,569 --> 00:32:18,170
and do a YouTube challenge videos and then drown myself with 25 different t-shirts on.

235
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:30,710
Change food. Let's go filling. Pays can stay at grueling because that's what we're going to do.

236
00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:41,259
Continue on the trail. Let's go. Press enter. Now we're good. Cool. Health is fair. Why?

237
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:56,759
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Why is health fair? What's wrong? Oh, I'm not even close.

238
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:13,029
Okay. Let's just get to Fort. Let's get to Fort Monopoly. Ah, shit. I gotta pay this guy

239
00:33:14,329 --> 00:33:18,809
60 bucks. He's got a hotel on here already. Fort Kearney, what's that worth?

240
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:24,630
Here, now at Fort Kearney, would you like to look around? Yes, I would.

241
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:39,779
You died in your, you literally died in your neighbor's yard. No, I died in my neighbor's

242
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:57,319
pool. Why did I have to drown? All right. Let's check the supplies. I got, I only have five

243
00:33:57,319 --> 00:34:03,430
sets of clothing. I have to get something. I have to trade. Attempt to trade. Can I,

244
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:09,260
can anybody have any clothes? You meet another immigrant who wants one wagon axle. You don't

245
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:16,900
have this. Yeah, because I dragged it all down with me. Buy supplies. Okay. How much money do

246
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:22,900
we have? You have $335 clothing. $12 per set. What's this fucking premium bullshit?

247
00:34:23,619 --> 00:34:45,659
A couple, one, like two, three more, four more. Okay. No more. I need, I need axles too.

248
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:52,260
God damn it. How much are they? Did I lose anything else?

249
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:09,400
Check supplies, axles, guts, clothes. Now I've got plenty of bullets. Nobody knows how to use a

250
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:17,239
gun in this troop. How many, anybody know how to use a gun? No, no, no, no, no. Oh, let's

251
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:26,869
take 1500 bullets. No, Jax doesn't know how to use a gun. Jax only knows how to use pretend

252
00:35:26,869 --> 00:35:37,900
guns. He's a video game star. Okay. I think we're good. I'm going to stop to rest though.

253
00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:43,530
At least get, like bury me. Am I, what am I? We'll put, at least put something somewhere to

254
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:56,219
remember me. Uh, how many, okay. We'll take one day off. Okay. It is 250 miles to Chimney Rock.

255
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:08,440
Cool. Health is fair. Got plenty of food. You're still floating in your neighbor's pool.

256
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:13,929
Wrong trail again. I wouldn't have done this. Somebody's stress eating because they lost the

257
00:36:13,929 --> 00:36:26,329
trail. Who is it? Oh, we're going to get to a stump. I don't even feel invested anymore.

258
00:36:26,329 --> 00:36:43,849
I don't even feel involved anymore. Yes, I would. Happy new year, everybody. It's April 18th. Why

259
00:36:43,849 --> 00:37:06,150
would they play this song? I would accept like, like December 31st, 1848. I can't,

260
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:12,940
I can't get out of this. Okay guys, I can. I'm going to, I'm going to change the pace.

261
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:18,090
We're going to go, we're going to do strenuous. Let's take a look at the map.

262
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:31,539
Okay. Your route, rivers, mountains, land marks forts. Okay, let's keep going. It is 86 miles to

263
00:37:31,539 --> 00:37:43,260
Fort Laramie. Yes. Severe blizzard. That's okay. It's snowy. We can make it. Don't need to size

264
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:47,420
it up. I got plenty of food. I was corrected by you. Pass a gravesite. Would you like to

265
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:51,579
look closer? Yes, I would because I would like to be buried here. I would like to at

266
00:37:51,579 --> 00:38:01,130
least remember I told you here lies. Uh, can we just like, we just like put me on there too.

267
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:17,179
Hey, hey, hey, come out and play. Am I supposed to know who that is?

268
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:24,760
You are now at Fort Laramie. Would you like to look around? Uh-huh.

269
00:38:33,449 --> 00:38:44,949
That's just a baby toy that plays random songs. Oh, it comes with four songs. Uh,

270
00:38:44,949 --> 00:38:54,420
how are we doing? Let me check my supplies again. I got plenty of bolts. I got some

271
00:38:54,420 --> 00:39:01,190
money left. Pounds of food. We're good. We're good. 190 miles to Independence Rock.

272
00:39:04,099 --> 00:39:11,019
Severe blizzard again. Weather warm. Interesting. Now, as sure this isn't like ash coming from

273
00:39:11,019 --> 00:39:32,090
a volcano. Fair health. Fair warm. Fair. Here comes the rock. Get there. Come on.

274
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:43,860
You are now at Independence Rock. I would love to look around. May 5th.

275
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:54,500
If you smell. All right. Let's, uh, talk to somebody. Uh, Big Louie tells you.

276
00:39:55,300 --> 00:40:01,699
Goodbye, Platte River. Goodbye, Sandy Hills and White Buffalo Sculls. Now we climb the

277
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:07,940
Sweetwater Valley to cross the continental divide and self-pass. Once across the Rockies,

278
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:26,579
we'll make a steep descent into the Green River Valley. Find wild fruit. Do I find it?

279
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:35,909
Size it up. Hunt for fruit. Enter key to start or stop walking. Point the rifle.

280
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:42,019
Novice hunters to point the rifle expert hunters and space bars fire.

281
00:40:42,579 --> 00:41:09,750
Well, I'm a novice hunter, so yeah, I told you you shoot squirrels. Oh,

282
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:23,829
fuck. That squirrel was coming for blood from the animals you shot. Got 923 pounds of meat.

283
00:41:26,179 --> 00:41:47,829
What? How big was that buffalo? Was that buffalo as big as a car?

284
00:41:47,829 --> 00:41:53,269
Buffaloes are huge. Holy shit. I, I don't know why that I can only carry a hundred pounds.

285
00:41:53,269 --> 00:42:04,119
Who cares? Actually, yeah, they are. They are huge. Aren't they? That just seemed like such

286
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:12,010
an enormous, unbelievable number. This is what happens when you live in this current day and

287
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:23,960
age. That's sad. I did not believe that for a whole 10 seconds. 900 pounds of meat. Click

288
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:30,250
this link, link, link. Hold on. What do you mean? Hold on. First of all, I can't, my mouse is

289
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:47,460
locked in. At least I got, did the video, did I public the video? That's fucking fast.

290
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:00,869
No, I died. Well, hopefully someone will public my t-shirt challenge.

291
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:09,239
All right. Continue on the trail. I can't believe I only have, which rock is this one?

292
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:29,400
You are now at South Pass. Let's look around. Did they talk about me when I'm gone? Do you

293
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:42,409
think? Plenty of clothes. Look at the map. I'm getting there. I'm going to get there. I'm

294
00:43:42,409 --> 00:43:53,179
going to get to the whole of Oregon. Talk to people. A young girl tells you. My father is

295
00:43:53,179 --> 00:43:58,380
very sick and we are resting here until he gets better. We have been pushing too hard

296
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:03,019
and our health has suffered. When my father is able to travel again, we will go at a slow

297
00:44:03,019 --> 00:44:19,670
pace. Sorry. My father was fairly wealthy. That was the Otto voice. No. Hi everyone,

298
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:24,550
this is Otto. That's the Otto voice. That was, I just, no, that was Otto. Yeah,

299
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:29,849
that was Otto whispering. You were right. And you know, every voice of the, hey,

300
00:44:29,849 --> 00:44:47,820
Germa quotes four voices, quote Elberton. Otto's cousin. The trail divides here. You

301
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:53,340
may head for green river crossing, head for Fort Bridger, see the map. Let's take a look.

302
00:44:56,179 --> 00:45:08,760
This is our first ever choice. What's the, how do I go to straight as hard as possible?

303
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:23,369
It's not Fort Bridger. We're going straight as far, as fast as I can. Let you guys vote.

304
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:44,340
Okay. Hold on. Okay. Let's you guys can vote. Don't do it yet. I said, don't do it yet.

305
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:53,210
Don't do it yet. You have to wait cause I have to switch between like three screens. Stop it.

306
00:45:53,210 --> 00:46:06,760
Okay. Don't wait. Stop. Here we go. Ready? Don't do it yet. Don't do it yet. Hold on.

307
00:46:07,719 --> 00:46:16,780
Don't do it yet. Do it now. You see I have to wait cause I have to get it like squared up.

308
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:26,300
How the fuck am I ever going to know when you're clicking on? No, this is not going

309
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:37,940
to work. Hmm. I think they're clicking on one, two or three. I can't zoom in because my

310
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:42,420
mouse is locked in the emulator. So I have to stay here. If I hit escape,

311
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:48,420
I pull out and it screws the whole thing up. It looks, it let, that looks like one to me.

312
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:54,900
That's one. All right. Thanks for voting. Hold on. Let me get like this off. I have to hit

313
00:46:54,900 --> 00:47:02,329
the BRB. Thanks for pointing. A straw poll would just be easier. Yeah, it probably would.

314
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:08,489
Okay. We're back. We're going one. That's the one I was going to pick anyway.

315
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:20,539
Another river. All right. You're now at green river crossing. Let's look around.

316
00:47:20,539 --> 00:47:34,420
This looks like a big river. Okay. Check. How are we doing? Talk to people.

317
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:41,019
A Shoshone Indian tells you when wagons first started coming through here, we did not mind.

318
00:47:41,019 --> 00:47:45,340
We even found it good to trade game and fish with the travelers and help them cross the

319
00:47:45,340 --> 00:48:00,139
rivers. Now there are too many white men and too little land for grazing. I mean we did,

320
00:48:00,139 --> 00:48:08,280
we did like, I mean, I mean the Native Americans, like we, like we fucking,

321
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,320
we fucked them. You know what I mean? Like that's like, it was bullshit.

322
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:44,420
They got a bad fucking deal. It's true. It's true. But let's cross. That's not political.

323
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:52,519
It's not. That's just, that's just, that's just the thing, right? I'm not going to afford

324
00:48:52,519 --> 00:49:07,130
it. This is 20 fucking feet deep. You must cross the river in order to continue. The

325
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:12,889
river at this point is 400 feet across and 20 feet deep. Take my money. You know what I

326
00:49:12,889 --> 00:49:22,820
mean? Take my money and get across safely. Take a ferry across. Use my money. I live on in my

327
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:33,699
money. I live on through my capital. Take the ferry. It's only five bucks. Why could I not

328
00:49:33,699 --> 00:49:51,320
take it before? It's only five dollars. Yeah. Take my money. Get over safely. Start a family

329
00:49:51,320 --> 00:50:11,579
with Jex. Kevin Jex. Virgin Jerma. Chad Jex. Oh, fuck. From Green River Crossing,

330
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:24,969
it is 143 miles to Soda Spring. People are good. Health is good. I think we can turn it

331
00:50:24,969 --> 00:50:32,280
to grueling. No, I'm not going to go hunting. I don't need it. I've got my money. Very little

332
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:44,699
water. What do you mean very little water? Yeah, drink from the spring. Oh, Otto sure got

333
00:50:44,699 --> 00:50:49,210
big. I know who's been eating all the food. Now I know who's been stress eating.

334
00:50:57,719 --> 00:51:09,619
This is Inspector Gadget. No, it's not. Gadget.

335
00:51:13,829 --> 00:51:23,800
Everything is Inspector Gadget, apparently. Okay, we need to see if we can trade with somebody.

336
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:33,320
I got plenty of autos. Plenty of clothes. I might want to get some more food. Who wants

337
00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:36,840
Okay, look, look, look, look. We don't need bullets. 418 bullets.

338
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:41,219
He will trade you one ox. Do we need any more oxes?

339
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:50,260
Five community subs just came in from Cole. Thank you, Cole RG for the five community subs.

340
00:51:55,369 --> 00:52:00,650
What? Why? Hold on. Somebody just wrote, why do you have so much of everything? You casual

341
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:23,050
bank of fuck. What? Jesus. Because it said from Boston. I had to click it. If it said

342
00:52:23,929 --> 00:52:28,730
that you're penniless from Boston, I would have clicked that one. All right. Are you

343
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:40,840
willing to trade? No, it's my money. All right, let's go. Let's go fast. Really fast. Go. 57

344
00:52:40,840 --> 00:53:00,579
miles. Inadequate grass. Inadequate grass. Yes, I'd like to look around. Big boy. Ego. Thanks

345
00:53:00,579 --> 00:53:09,400
for the five community subs. Five subs. Thanks for dropping in with five. Thank you.

346
00:53:10,329 --> 00:53:15,780
Thank you, big boy. I think it's time to buy some I want to buy some more food.

347
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:18,739
No, I don't. Well, holy shit. This is a nice thing. No, look at that.

348
00:53:22,039 --> 00:53:29,159
That's pretty cheap. Is it? All right. No more. I've got to save my money.

349
00:53:30,039 --> 00:53:36,699
Because now I need to take ferries every time. Talk to people.

350
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:45,960
Fellow traveler tells you four voices. This one. No, this one. No, two.

351
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:59,210
This one. Three. I think four. Oh, which one? Hey. Fort. Fort Hall is a busy fort.

352
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:03,210
The wide stretches of meadow grass here are just what our tired animals need.

353
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:07,849
As for me, I'll fix up the wagon leaks. Amanda's real anxious to wash all the clothes

354
00:54:07,849 --> 00:54:15,099
and linens in one of those clay streets. Five. I got five now. I got five voices now.

355
00:54:17,429 --> 00:54:32,489
Uh, rest for two days. Go. Inadequate grass. Bad water. What does that mean?

356
00:54:34,489 --> 00:54:42,630
Find wild fruit. Cool. There was just you just ate it. There was this grass right there.

357
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:50,139
Bad water. Bad water. Health poor. Impassable trail. Oh, what do you mean? Bad water.

358
00:54:50,139 --> 00:55:01,820
Wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm stopping here to rest. No one wants to trade with you today.

359
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:08,820
Okay, fine. Jeez. All right, we're gonna slow it down. Change pace.

360
00:55:09,619 --> 00:55:19,900
We're gonna do steady. I'm also going to rest here for like three days. Three days. Health. Fair.

361
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:32,820
Okay. Continue. One of the oxen is injured. Okay, that's why I bought 15 of them. Bad water.

362
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:37,929
Bad water. Very little water. We're almost there. Just get there. Very little water.

363
00:55:37,929 --> 00:55:44,219
We're at water now. Find wild fruit. Why did that just pop up? You are now at the

364
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:57,610
Snake River Crossing. Would you like to look around? Yep. June 20th, 1848. Okay. How are

365
00:55:57,610 --> 00:56:07,780
we doing? Talk to people. A frantic wife tells you. Every, every time I do a, okay, every time

366
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:17,909
I do a female voice, they're always British. Why? It says right here. Then it says, I don't

367
00:56:17,909 --> 00:56:26,840
know how to do a female voice. The only, Paula Dane is the only female I can do. That's

368
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:38,460
not it. No, female voice. That's not Paula Dane or like Keira Knightley. There's Elmo. Paula

369
00:56:38,460 --> 00:57:03,619
Dane is Elmo. It says right here in the Shiver, Shively guidebook, you must hire an Indian to

370
00:57:03,619 --> 00:57:08,420
pilot you at the crossing of the Snake River, it being dangerous if not perfectly understood.

371
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:18,619
But my husband insists on crossing without a guide. That's pretty good. Well, your husband's,

372
00:57:18,619 --> 00:57:33,559
your husband's dumb. See you, see you when we get to cross, when we go across. I will take

373
00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:36,519
a, you must cross the river in order to continue. The river is at this point is

374
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:43,849
currently a thousand feet across and six feet deep in the middle. Okay. Attempt to

375
00:57:43,849 --> 00:57:49,289
forward the river, cock the wagon and floated across higher. We're going to hire somebody.

376
00:57:49,849 --> 00:57:56,840
A guide says that he will take your wagon across the river for exchange for two sets

377
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:16,039
of clothing. Yes. Can I give you like five? Thank you. Let's go. Made it. You had no trouble

378
00:58:16,039 --> 00:58:28,599
floating across the river. No, we didn't. Pogchamp. Pogchamp. Venuschamp. Jerma Venus

379
00:58:28,599 --> 00:58:43,940
Pogchamp. Jerma Venus Pogchamp. Fogchamp. Let's go. We're almost there. I'm going to

380
00:58:43,940 --> 00:59:10,090
get there. Otto has exhaustion. Go to sleep immediately. Five days. Metallix has a broken

381
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:21,980
leg from sleeping. Did you break your leg in bed? Ah, shit. I really twisted my ankle

382
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:33,940
to a point where I shattered my bones. And one of the oxygen has died. Inadequate

383
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:45,500
grass. It's okay. Metallix has got like gay for death. Yeah, you got to get up,

384
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:59,690
man and stretch. Be careful. A thief comes during the night and steals 36 pounds of food.

385
00:59:59,769 --> 01:00:12,659
How? Broke a bone playing Fortnite. A thief comes. All right. Well, you got,

386
01:00:12,659 --> 01:00:18,329
whatever. I got plenty of fucking food and money. I don't even know what happened.

387
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:26,019
I've got so many pounds of food. I just, I can't even count it. How do you count 900 pounds

388
01:00:26,019 --> 01:00:31,369
of food? It's just huge in there and it's just whatever. What am I gonna have today?

389
01:00:31,369 --> 01:00:42,650
Broccoli? Cheese? Meat? I don't know. It's just there. Tons of it. Let's look around.

390
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:57,139
That's Kim. Otto. And there's a baby, Jax Jr. Already had a kid. It didn't take you very long.

391
01:00:57,139 --> 01:01:13,110
Didn't take that long. I mean, I've been died for, I've been died for like

392
01:01:13,829 --> 01:01:23,340
up to a month. Wait a minute. Wait, is that, hold on. I've been dead for a month or two,

393
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:41,159
right? But the baby, that's a newborn. Takes nine months for, that's my, that's my son.

394
01:01:41,719 --> 01:01:59,780
I didn't, I can't even see my own son. I'm gonna beat this even as a banker casual.

395
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:16,500
I've never seen the end of this game. No, that's Jax's kid. No. Buy supplies. How much money do I

396
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:23,429
have? I need food. I'm gonna buy whatever I can for food. How many pounds? 100 pounds of

397
01:02:23,429 --> 01:02:40,949
food. Shit. 50 pounds of food. How much, wait, how much money do I have? Wait. No, I got 15

398
01:02:40,949 --> 01:02:50,869
bucks. That's, that's three more ferries. Okay, we're good. Leave the store. Talk to people.

399
01:02:51,829 --> 01:02:59,929
Aunt Rebecca tells you, at every fort along the trail, prices have been higher than at the

400
01:02:59,929 --> 01:03:07,130
previous fort. This is outrageous, y'all. They're taking advantage of us. If I had the

401
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:13,289
chance to do it again, I'd buy more supplies and independence. And I'd put a little more

402
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:20,840
butter. I can only do, I can only do a fucking Paula Deen. That's it. I can't do anything else.

403
01:03:24,409 --> 01:03:30,889
Do you need Paula Deen for your next project? I'm your guy. You need anything else? Just don't,

404
01:03:30,889 --> 01:03:44,039
don't call me. Cowboy Elmo.

405
01:03:51,980 --> 01:04:01,099
I thought this was a fucking bug. Reasons for camera to be on one, two, or three.

406
01:04:01,099 --> 01:04:11,059
Hold on. Let me show you this. Okay, this is fine. Just look. I thought, I don't know why. I don't

407
01:04:11,059 --> 01:04:22,150
know what the fuck is wrong with me. This is how you know that I'm fucking crazy. The shirt is

408
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:32,300
ripped, but it's okay. So I have one earphone in, right? I don't know how I moved. I don't

409
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:38,860
know how I moved a certain way, but this like came down and hit me in the chest. I don't,

410
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:42,940
I don't know how it happened. All I saw was this. I saw this like fall in front of my

411
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:49,820
face and hit me in the chest and I screamed. What's with this shirt? Because I put my,

412
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:56,500
look, when I was putting the shirt on, this shirt's like turning into cheesecloth because

413
01:04:56,500 --> 01:05:02,500
it's so old and my mother drew it. So I like put my head on and I ripped through right here,

414
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:06,579
but I don't, I'm not getting rid of it. I'm not getting, this is, I love this shirt.

415
01:05:06,579 --> 01:05:18,739
I accidentally ripped my hulk to my head through it. Fix it. No, I don't need to.

416
01:05:20,329 --> 01:05:29,659
Just be lucky that I didn't even wear clothes today. This just happened. This didn't happen

417
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:35,260
like three months ago. This happened like four or five days ago. I already have my sewing kit

418
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:41,829
available. I just said, yeah, let me like take this t-shirt that I got, this old t-shirt.

419
01:05:41,829 --> 01:05:58,889
Let me sew it together. Huh? But that's, I thought that was a scorpion. We got reports

420
01:05:58,889 --> 01:06:03,510
that there's like scorpions now and I'm like fucking freaking out about it. I'm like,

421
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:28,010
wait, where are they? I've seen one already. Here we go. Uh, weather. Cool. So we're good.

422
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:31,690
I can't, no more supplies. We're going to continue on the trail from Fort Boise.

423
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:36,889
It is 160 miles to the Blue Mountains. Go, go. Very little water. I can't buy water. Where

424
01:06:36,889 --> 01:06:48,389
do I get water? Health, poor. Health, poor. Oh, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Stop.

425
01:06:49,269 --> 01:07:03,349
Rest for like three days. Still poor. You can't, I can't buy water. Are we going to have to

426
01:07:03,349 --> 01:07:09,480
vampire somebody on the cruise ship here? Whose blood are we going to drink? We have to

427
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:26,820
vampire somebody. Uh, look at that. We're almost there. Just go. Come on. Get there.

428
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:43,750
One of the ox has died. It's okay. Come on. Got wild fruit. There's water right there.

429
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:54,539
There's water and fruit. Nice. Thank God for those random babies. You're now at

430
01:07:54,539 --> 01:07:59,510
Blue Mountains. Would you like to look around? Water up on that mountain.

431
01:08:06,699 --> 01:08:14,519
Let's talk. No, talk. Uh, Marnie Stewart tells you,

432
01:08:18,229 --> 01:08:23,510
We followed the edge of the desert from Fort Boise to the forbidding wall of the Blue

433
01:08:23,510 --> 01:08:30,810
Mountains. The hills were dreadful steep, locking both wheels. And coming down slow,

434
01:08:31,369 --> 01:08:38,170
we got down safe. Poor animals. No grass or water for days.

435
01:08:39,130 --> 01:08:59,670
Six voices. Going right for Boise. Head for Fort Walla or Fort, or head for the Dallas. Hold on.

436
01:08:59,670 --> 01:09:14,329
The Dallas. That Dallas. Straight on. Straight on. 125 miles. Go. Heavy fog.

437
01:09:15,130 --> 01:09:22,069
Should I just, should I just start sprinting? Yeah, we have to start sprinting.

438
01:09:23,770 --> 01:09:27,689
Just go get to the finish line. You find an abandoned wagon with the following three

439
01:09:27,689 --> 01:09:34,579
sets of clothing and 21 bullets. Thank you. Broken wagon axle. Would you like to try

440
01:09:34,659 --> 01:09:38,970
to repair it? Yeah. You were able to repair the wagon axle. Thank you.

441
01:09:38,970 --> 01:09:47,579
You find an abandoned wagon, but it is empty. Was it mine? Water right here.

442
01:09:47,579 --> 01:09:58,890
You are now at the Dallas. Would you like to look around? Yes. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

443
01:09:58,890 --> 01:10:03,140
Let's have the conversation. We're at the Dallas. We're almost there.

444
01:10:04,199 --> 01:10:05,640
Amy Witherspoon tells you,

445
01:10:11,479 --> 01:10:23,829
Cousin Lydia engaged. Passage down the Columbia with

446
01:10:24,390 --> 01:10:30,949
Indians a canoe with 17 people in luggage. The wind blew so heavy they had to lay by.

447
01:10:31,989 --> 01:10:37,930
New dark high waves came up over their heads. Finally they made it to shore safely.

448
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:49,420
Seven. Well, four. I'm Hugh Bliss. That's what I was just doing. That's what I heard it.

449
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:55,739
Yeah, that's, that's what I've been hearing. We've heard a lot of Hugh Bliss talking.

450
01:10:58,260 --> 01:11:12,340
Interesting. I wish I was between Derma's vocal bands. What? Why? What does that mean?

451
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:19,689
Seven voices. All right. We're almost there. Look at this. Oregon city. I'm going to sprint

452
01:11:19,689 --> 01:11:29,449
as fast as possible. Change pace, grueling, change food rations, eat as much food as possible.

453
01:11:30,090 --> 01:11:37,020
Eat, just, just stuff your face forever. Go. The trail divides here. You may float

454
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:42,380
down the Columbia River or take the Barlow toll road. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.

455
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:55,340
Float down the river. Can I pay for it? Is it my money? Can we take them down?

456
01:11:58,470 --> 01:12:08,060
Toll road is money. Toll road. That's five bucks. You must pay $12 to travel on the

457
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:12,939
Barlow Road. Are you willing to do this? Oh, thank God. Thank God. I'm still living.

458
01:12:12,939 --> 01:12:20,010
You thought I died in the first five minutes. No, I'm still alive. 12 bucks. Let's go. From

459
01:12:20,010 --> 01:12:25,449
the Dallas. It is a hundred miles to the Willamette Valley. Go as fast as you can.

460
01:12:27,319 --> 01:12:33,350
Sprint. Heavy fog. Lose a day. Who cares? Impassable trail. Lose four days. Go.

461
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:41,380
Just sprint. Just go as fast as you can. Just no clip. You find an abandoned wagon.

462
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:52,649
Three sets of clothes. Excellent. I made it. Is this Oregon? Congratulations. You've made it

463
01:12:52,649 --> 01:12:58,779
to Oregon. Let's see how many points you have received. Four people in fair health.

464
01:12:58,779 --> 01:13:05,659
1600 points. One wagon. 14 ox. Nine spare parts. 23 sets of clothes. 1500 volts. 342

465
01:13:05,659 --> 01:13:26,180
pounds of food. Free cash. 1800. 13 points. Let's go. So this is just a fake leaderboard.

466
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:44,939
It doesn't mean anything. Banker doesn't count. All right. Type your name. I beat the Oregon

467
01:13:44,939 --> 01:13:55,989
Trail. Banker doesn't count. Banker doesn't count. Banker doesn't count. Banker doesn't

468
01:13:55,989 --> 01:14:05,590
count. Count. You guys are fucked. All right. Here we go. Let's check. That's it. That's

469
01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:24,090
that. I beat it. I did it. I win. Let's pick another one. That was fun. I never even

470
01:14:24,090 --> 01:14:28,010
like played that game all the way through. I always just died in the first like 15 minutes

471
01:14:28,010 --> 01:14:42,380
every time. All right. Let's go back to the list of games. Like this. Here we are. Remember,

472
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:51,399
if you want me to scroll, you click on the German face. Popsicle face. Because we are,

473
01:14:51,399 --> 01:14:58,039
I mean, we just, we just did the Oregon Trail. That's it. I might not ever even see

474
01:14:58,039 --> 01:15:09,430
past this page. All right. Here you go. Click. Let's determine. We want me to scroll. We've

475
01:15:09,430 --> 01:15:44,569
got to click the face. Go for it. Okay. I should have done deluxe first. I didn't pick.

476
01:15:49,770 --> 01:16:06,170
Oh my God. Oh, this is all fucked up. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. There we go. Now go

477
01:16:06,170 --> 01:16:32,229
for it. There was like 20,000 clicks. People could just spam. Fucking Oregon Trail deluxe.

478
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:57,159
Just, we just did this. All right. This is closing in 10 seconds. Five, six, seven,

479
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:05,670
eight, nine, ten. Oh, come on. Don't do this to me. Do I have to flip a coin?

480
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:20,579
It was, I guess we're going. We're scrolling. I have to flip. I have to

481
01:17:20,579 --> 01:17:25,060
flip a coin. I have to. That's fair. That's the only fair way to do this.

482
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:30,090
I stopped it and it was tied. Let's flip a coin. I don't have any coins up here.

483
01:17:30,090 --> 01:17:38,859
All right. We're going to flip the wine cork. Okay. If it lands on wine stain side, then

484
01:17:38,859 --> 01:17:45,939
we're doing Oregon Trail deluxe. If it lands on clean cork side, we're doing a scroll.

485
01:17:45,939 --> 01:17:52,539
Here we go. Ready? Wait, what am I? What is that going to do? No. Okay. Yeah. If this,

486
01:17:52,539 --> 01:18:02,890
if it's pointing up, whatever one's pointing up. Okay. So ready? If, uh, what was it?

487
01:18:02,890 --> 01:18:08,170
If the clean's pointing up, it's, we scroll. And if, okay, clean pointing up scroll.

488
01:18:08,729 --> 01:18:55,899
I didn't want to play this. Another, I'm going to, okay. I didn't, I never said I had to play

489
01:18:55,899 --> 01:19:03,989
it well. I'm going to try to die as fast as possible. I actually have a mouse this time.

490
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:09,460
Hey, you're about to, you're about to begin great adventure. Traveling the Oregon Trail

491
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:13,300
across the rugged landscape of North America. Your covered wagon pulled by a team of oxen

492
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:32,180
will travel from, why didn't we just do this one first? Uh, why didn't you? I don't know

493
01:19:32,180 --> 01:19:38,569
because this is what you guys voted for. Uh, I'm going to be a doctor. No, a teacher.

494
01:19:46,500 --> 01:20:01,750
We didn't though. What? This is what you guys clicked on. They clicked scroll. Well,

495
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:08,569
I closed the poll and like 15 seconds later it came through. I got to close it at some

496
01:20:08,569 --> 01:20:56,060
point. Can't sit there forever. And I flipped the cork. No, not Junior. There you go. What?

497
01:20:56,060 --> 01:21:37,430
Oh, there he is again. All right. Let's, uh, uh, do you have 400 bucks? That's it. 10, 6, um,

498
01:21:37,430 --> 01:21:46,710
who cares about bullets? I'm not going to use them. And, uh, 800 pounds of food,

499
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:54,260
500 pounds of food. Let's go. Let's go. When do you set off? Uh, what's the worst month

500
01:21:54,260 --> 01:22:04,279
to do it? August. This one looks so much better. I, oh, a song. Oh, a song. I don't care. Uh,

501
01:22:04,279 --> 01:22:15,180
what was I doing? This is cool. Uh, okay. Status. Money. I'm a teacher. Map. Continue.

502
01:22:15,739 --> 01:22:32,279
Talk. Trade. Pace. Ruling. Pace. Continue. You've reached the Kansas River Cross. We just

503
01:22:32,279 --> 01:22:39,140
did. This is just a better graphical version. Talk. With crowds of people waiting to get on

504
01:22:39,140 --> 01:22:42,180
the ferry, we should be, could be stranded here for days. Hope there's enough grace for

505
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:46,739
all those animals. Not many people carry feed at other weight though than cross a rickety.

506
01:22:46,739 --> 01:23:01,100
Okay. We're going to afford it. We're good. We made it. You made it across,

507
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:03,579
but got stuck in the muddy river banks. That doesn't matter.

508
01:23:07,449 --> 01:23:19,050
Kim was bitten by a snake in the water. It's been two more days. Kim is turning purple.

509
01:23:21,029 --> 01:23:33,109
Yes. Oh, we got to go. I can't rest for like, I can't rest for like a hundred days.

510
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:43,159
Time out. What do you mean time out? You must cross the river.

511
01:23:43,159 --> 01:23:47,739
Didn't I just cross the river? It's only one feet deep. I just did this.

512
01:23:48,300 --> 01:24:03,210
Wait, somebody stole 15 bucks from the wagon? Who? You made it safely across. We're fine.

513
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:12,140
It's a different river. Oh, rest for a day. Here we go. We're going to get to,

514
01:24:13,619 --> 01:24:16,520
have I beat both? Kim's died of...

515
01:24:30,539 --> 01:24:33,500
Yeah, number 700 has dysentery. Of course they do.

516
01:24:40,729 --> 01:24:43,050
All right. Time out. Time out. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

517
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:53,180
Turn down the rations. Rest for a minute here. We can't have everybody just die. Three.

518
01:24:53,180 --> 01:24:57,689
This is how I used to play it back when I was in middle school. I didn't understand.

519
01:24:58,250 --> 01:25:12,600
Are they still eating food when I'm sitting here? Hey, what are you doing? What? What's

520
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:19,579
going on? Why isn't playing itself? You had a wagon wheel break. You're able to fix it.

521
01:25:19,579 --> 01:25:27,960
You've reached the... I didn't do anything. That's not how living works. Health is poor.

522
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:37,850
Hold on. Rest. How many? Let me check my my shit here. Hold on. Rest for two days. Time out.

523
01:25:37,850 --> 01:25:46,039
Don't just go. Status. Everyone's in poor health here. I only have 200 pounds of food?

524
01:25:46,039 --> 01:25:53,829
I need to change this. That's okay. I need to trade. What do you want to get by trading?

525
01:25:53,829 --> 01:26:00,279
I want pounds of food. Like a hundred pounds of food. Sorry, but nobody here's got a hundred

526
01:26:00,279 --> 01:26:15,560
pounds of food to spare. Talk. Jimmy Rock by Moonlight is awfully sublime. Many Indians

527
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:19,880
came to our wagon with fish to exchange for clothing. We bought a number. They'd understand.

528
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:26,619
Okay. Okay, let's go. Hunt. I can hunt for food. You can't go hunting because

529
01:26:26,619 --> 01:26:32,149
you don't have any bullets. Oh, I didn't buy any bullets because I didn't use them last time.

530
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:53,270
Oops. Dermot Jr. is suffering from exhaustion. The baby? No. Let's rest for like four days.

531
01:26:57,140 --> 01:27:10,810
Rest. Rest. Rest. I still don't... I need food. Okay. Rest. How many days have gone by?

532
01:27:11,050 --> 01:27:19,699
There we go. Timeout. That's what's the status now. Exhaustion. Poor. Poor. No bullets.

533
01:27:20,579 --> 01:27:30,460
I only... Okay. I'm doing all right. He's 20 years old. He's 20 months old. Do hunting,

534
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:42,069
please. Otto has cholera. Okay. I need bullets. Buy. How much money do I have?

535
01:27:42,869 --> 01:27:50,520
I have five dollars. Bullets. Okay. I can get a box. I can get one box of bullets,

536
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:58,899
which is 20 bullets. 20 bullets at the store. Hunt. Hunting is not allowed near the fort

537
01:27:58,899 --> 01:28:11,350
because there are too many people around. Okay. What was that? I keep thinking that

538
01:28:11,350 --> 01:28:16,649
somebody's breaking their legs. There's no grass for the oxen. Dermot Jr. got sick and died.

539
01:28:18,170 --> 01:28:50,890
All right. Well, okay. Well, hunt. Who's still alive? Otto and who? There's no bullet?

540
01:28:50,890 --> 01:29:04,569
There's no travel time? Pretty sick Sega Genesis sounds. How much meat? You shot

541
01:29:04,890 --> 01:29:08,970
2800 pounds of food and used 20 bullets. You can only carry 200 food back. Well,

542
01:29:08,970 --> 01:29:13,960
what's the point of shooting that many? All right. Everybody rest. We're going to rest for

543
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:47,859
a long time. Nine days. Didn't Otto die? No. No. All right. Everyone. People are recovering.

544
01:29:53,529 --> 01:30:05,029
Okay. Let's do a strenuous pace. Rations. Let's go up to stay meager. Let's talk.

545
01:30:05,670 --> 01:30:10,489
Goodbye. Flat river. Goodbye. Sand hills and white buffaloes. We already read this.

546
01:30:12,069 --> 01:30:24,470
Well, we already saw that. We're almost halfway there. You found some wild fruit and

547
01:30:24,470 --> 01:30:29,350
BIA 700 broke their arm pulling it out. Otto was bitten by a snake. He's dead. That's a

548
01:30:29,350 --> 01:30:42,539
death sentence. How do you, how do I cure his snake bite? Can I get poison cure? He's just

549
01:30:42,539 --> 01:30:52,300
dead. Otto died of a snake bite. BIA number 700 is the only one left. He broke his arm

550
01:30:53,260 --> 01:31:12,949
picking berries. What? That was so fast. Oh, Otto died of a snake. Otto got bit by a snake.

551
01:31:12,949 --> 01:31:19,829
Oh no. A few days later, Otto died of a snake bite. BIA 700 just got sick and died immediately.

552
01:31:20,390 --> 01:31:28,659
We got to Independence Rock. Who's alive? Is it just the oxen? There's nobody alive.

553
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:37,640
There's nobody on the way. It's me. I'm still alive. I made it this whole time. All right.

554
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:49,300
Rest. Rest. All the food is mine. Nine days of rest. I'm taking this dead seriously now.

555
01:31:49,300 --> 01:32:06,310
I only need to, I have 300 pounds of food. I can eat as much as I want too. This is great.

556
01:32:06,310 --> 01:32:20,869
I'm going to make it. Yeah, I'm going to make it. All right. I'm, everything's fair.

557
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:31,850
I'm eating my fill. I'm just steak and mashed potatoes and green beans. It's perfect.

558
01:32:31,850 --> 01:32:41,720
Got to South Pass. Can we hunt? No, I don't have any bullets. I need to try to buy.

559
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:52,630
You can only buy supplies at forts. What about trade? Bullets. I need like five. Nobody's got

560
01:32:52,630 --> 01:32:58,140
five bullets to spare. I find that really hard to believe. Head to fort to buy supplies. Take

561
01:32:58,140 --> 01:33:09,100
the shortcut to Green River. How much money do I have? I have two bucks. I can't buy anything.

562
01:33:09,100 --> 01:33:19,100
All right. We're going to take the shortcut. The water. I'll get the water soon.

563
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:40,100
Come on. Go. The water is right here. Almost there. Yes. All right. Now I'm going to sit

564
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:52,359
down. I'm going to rest for a couple days. Resting. We're now at fair. 219 pounds of

565
01:33:52,359 --> 01:34:13,100
food. River is 400 feet wide and 20 feet deep. I don't have enough money to get the ferry. I need

566
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:35,850
the ferry. Cock the wagon and float it. Yes. I did it. You thought I was going to crash.

567
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:46,840
No, I wasn't making a YouTube video this time. I'm getting all the way there.

568
01:34:46,840 --> 01:35:01,699
No, wait. Stop, stop. No, no, no, no. Rest, rest, rest. Four days. Come on,

569
01:35:01,699 --> 01:35:17,699
get over the cholera. Just eat more food. Have more chicken soup. No grass. What's this?

570
01:35:17,699 --> 01:35:26,619
Soda springs. Okay. Let me trade. I need bullets. I just want, I only need five bullets.

571
01:35:26,619 --> 01:35:33,590
Nobody's got five bullets spare. Okay. Anybody have one bullet to spare? I just need one. I

572
01:35:33,590 --> 01:35:38,310
didn't need to shoot one thing. Sure. I'll trade you one bullet for one set of clothing.

573
01:35:38,310 --> 01:35:56,630
Is that a deal? Oh, you fucking asshole. I was going to say, I can't like bum a cigarette

574
01:35:56,630 --> 01:36:08,310
off somebody. One bullet if you didn't have it. Here we go. Hunt. Shot has to count.

575
01:36:08,310 --> 01:36:17,060
No, it's going to be a buffalo. Don't shoot the rabbit. You're going to miss. No, don't shoot the

576
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:23,430
squirrel. I need a big animal like an, like a buffalo or an oxen. This will do. This will do.

577
01:36:28,180 --> 01:36:39,689
What? Wait, hold on. That didn't connect? How did that miss? There's no way. That's unbelievable.

578
01:36:39,689 --> 01:37:03,000
I'll trade you one bullet for one pound of food. Is it a deal? Yeah. Let's go. Fair. There

579
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:10,409
it is. Done. That's going to be like 200. 100 pounds of food. Thank you very much. Let's go.

580
01:37:10,970 --> 01:37:26,409
Derm is well again. I'm doing just fine. Okay. Trade. Five bullets. No one has five in the

581
01:37:26,409 --> 01:37:35,659
fort. No one has five. Everyone just has one. One bullet. Sorry. Nobody's got one bullet to

582
01:37:35,659 --> 01:37:51,859
spare. It's a blizzard. Stop. All right. Just rest in the blizzard. Just wait it out. I'm

583
01:37:51,859 --> 01:38:12,920
all right. I'm okay. I'm back to being poor. Fair. We're good. You lost the trail. That's okay.

584
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:17,350
I'm still doing fine. I'll pick it up again though. How many days is it going to take you

585
01:38:17,350 --> 01:38:31,449
to do this? Three? Two days. Three days. Three days. Four days of losing the trail. Five. God.

586
01:38:31,449 --> 01:38:54,979
Another fucking blizzard. Health is good. All right. Go. I'm almost there. I'm going

587
01:38:54,979 --> 01:38:58,899
to do it. Oh, just you backer. You're so easy. What about on teacher? I only had like

588
01:38:58,899 --> 01:39:13,800
$400. I'm going to make it. I will make it. I will persevere. I will get there. I have diarrhea.

589
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:29,500
Slow down. You can't die of diarrhea. I mean, you can actually, but it has to be a lot,

590
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:42,819
right? Okay. You've reached, you've reached the snake river crossing. That's such bullshit.

591
01:39:42,819 --> 01:39:51,939
Where's the guy that bought 1500 bullets last game? He's not here. Okay. Uh, how

592
01:39:51,939 --> 01:39:58,020
many, how much company? How many sets of clothing do I have? Yeah, I don't need all

593
01:39:58,020 --> 01:40:23,579
these clothes. Let's go safely again. We make it safe again. I, I'm, I'm, I'm okay. Gruelling. Go.

594
01:40:24,140 --> 01:40:34,779
Oh my God. He almost didn't make. I were, but you were able to replace it. Okay.

595
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:40,899
I keep thinking that's my neck. Derma is doing just fine. He's well again.

596
01:40:44,229 --> 01:40:54,279
All right. Trade. One bullet. Can I just buy one bullet box of bullets? I can't just buy

597
01:40:54,359 --> 01:41:06,140
one. Let's talk. Anybody. You'll not get your wagon over the blue mountains, Mr. Leave it. Cross

598
01:41:06,140 --> 01:41:10,140
your goods over with a pack animals. Get yourself a couple of good mules, pieces of wagons,

599
01:41:10,140 --> 01:41:15,180
litter the trail left by them. Folks who don't need good advice. Thank you. Appreciate it.

600
01:41:17,449 --> 01:41:24,390
Trade for dollars. Um, 15 dollars. What do you want? What does anybody want?

601
01:41:25,609 --> 01:41:50,899
15 bucks for one set of clothing. Absolutely. Let's go buy box of bullets and, um,

602
01:41:50,899 --> 01:41:58,619
27 pounds of food. No, what am I doing? I don't need to do that. I can just shoot.

603
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:17,619
Why would I buy food? Whatever. I'm going to make it. I don't know why I did that.

604
01:42:21,189 --> 01:42:29,060
Don't shoot the rabbits of both bullets. Waste of bullets. Move. Is it only rabbits?

605
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:38,779
I'm a bit panic shooting. All right. That's it. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

606
01:42:42,329 --> 01:43:01,060
Yeah, go type. No, I have typhoid fever. Just go sleep for nine days. You'll be fine.

607
01:43:14,550 --> 01:43:29,750
That's how typhoid works. I'm fine. Just have to go to bed for a few days.

608
01:43:29,750 --> 01:43:35,800
Everyone's Spider-Man goes to sleep for like five days and he thinks it's been like one

609
01:43:35,800 --> 01:43:49,619
night and he gets his like powers. Remember that episode of the cartoon? All right.

610
01:43:49,619 --> 01:44:12,520
All right. The home stretch. This lady's a white walker. Uh, okay. Let's, um,

611
01:44:13,239 --> 01:44:31,939
I want to see the map. Here we are. That was like piercing blue eyes. I think I'm good. I

612
01:44:31,939 --> 01:44:43,100
don't need to rest. I'm in good health. Let's go shortcut. I have a fever. Sleep for nine

613
01:44:43,100 --> 01:45:12,039
days. Just go to bed for nine days. Works every time. Don't even do that. Are you telling

614
01:45:12,039 --> 01:45:18,199
me that I can get typhoid fever and get better from typhoid in nine days, but I have

615
01:45:18,199 --> 01:45:23,979
a fever and it won't. Okay. That was going to say. And only prescription is more cowbell.

616
01:45:26,039 --> 01:45:32,920
Reference for those Saturday Night Live fans of you, of you out there. An ox wandered off.

617
01:45:34,069 --> 01:45:42,569
It's all right. I have like 10 of them. Shut up. Broken neck. It's all right. I'm almost there.

618
01:45:42,569 --> 01:45:59,140
An ox is sick. I made it. I did it. I just have to go through here. I got food. I, how

619
01:45:59,140 --> 01:46:12,760
much money do I have? I have 35 cents. I don't have, it's $12. I can do it. I just have to

620
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:31,899
raft down the river. I don't have the money for the toll. Trade for cash for one ox. I have

621
01:46:31,899 --> 01:46:58,600
six ox. Oh yeah. Toll road. $15. I'll see ya. I'm coming home. We're there. I did it. I made

622
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:17,239
it. I made it. I did the Oregon Trail. Did I die? I thought I died right here. I did it.

623
01:47:17,239 --> 01:47:31,300
Germa lives. I just, yeah, I die in the next episode. Celebratory, celebratory dysentery.

624
01:47:31,300 --> 01:47:45,619
Yeah. And I think that was a teacher. Less points than last time. Got the teacher bonus.

625
01:47:46,810 --> 01:47:58,069
Pretty cool. All right. Let's, uh, thankfully that's, oh, there are no more Oregon Trails

626
01:47:58,069 --> 01:48:16,710
on here. So I think we're fairly safe in getting out of this. Let me go here. All

627
01:48:16,710 --> 01:48:25,270
right. So I don't know if we're ever going to get out of here. Click the Germa face

628
01:48:25,270 --> 01:48:42,149
if you want to scroll. Remember. Remember. Let me get right, right here. Hold on. Let

629
01:48:42,149 --> 01:49:06,939
me get this restarted. Okay. Oh, wow. A hundred percent. One hundred fucking percent. That's

630
01:49:06,939 --> 01:49:18,819
a lot. Sorry, Wolfenstein. Doesn't look like it's going to be your day today.

631
01:49:18,819 --> 01:49:35,800
A hundred percent is like basically everyone. Basically. Yeah. All right, guys. I think this

632
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:39,560
is just an absolute no contest. I'm going to scroll and scrolling means this whole page

633
01:49:39,560 --> 01:50:08,710
goes down. So we are going to go all the way down here to here, as you see. Here we go again.

634
01:50:08,710 --> 01:50:32,260
Ooh, we're indecisive this time. Leaning towards Batman returns. A lot of people want to

635
01:50:32,260 --> 01:50:50,539
scroll too. I think it's going to be Batman. No, Doom the Roguelike. He's rigging it.

636
01:50:51,899 --> 01:51:03,739
Doom the Roguelike. What is this even going to be? All right. That's it. We're going to play

637
01:51:03,819 --> 01:51:13,210
Doom the Roguelike. Let's open it. I'm going to remove this now because it doesn't need to

638
01:51:13,210 --> 01:51:26,970
be there anymore for the sake of right now. All right. Doom the Roguelike. All right. I guess

639
01:51:26,970 --> 01:51:47,159
let's open it. Hold on. There we go. Major changes since Doom Roguelike. Let's see also.

640
01:51:47,159 --> 01:52:01,300
Okay. Enter name. Choose a trait. Iron Man, finesse hell runner, tough as nails,

641
01:52:01,300 --> 01:52:09,369
son of a bitch, son of a gun, reloader, eagle eye, cat eye, or brute. Pick banker. Hit points

642
01:52:09,369 --> 01:52:16,899
by 10. Iron Man, finesse, hell runner, tough as nails, increases damage by, I like damage by

643
01:52:16,899 --> 01:52:31,369
one. Firing time minus 20 percent, son of a gun. The trip was long. You thought it would

644
01:52:31,369 --> 01:52:39,689
never end. Hell, a job as a Marine Reserve is so boring. You hate UAC. Nothing happens here.

645
01:52:39,689 --> 01:52:46,810
Even now, you have to wait for your fellow Marines who are supposed to check what happened

646
01:52:46,810 --> 01:52:55,689
on Phobos. Not knowing what to do with yourself, you just sit near the comm console and listen to

647
01:52:55,689 --> 01:53:08,939
the news from your fellow Marines. Okay. Enter. Hell, what a bloodshed. You hear from the comm

648
01:53:09,579 --> 01:53:19,319
everywhere. What happened here? Look, there's someone there. Oh no, God. Gunshot. This can't

649
01:53:19,319 --> 01:53:33,909
be true. Help. I'm Jake. Is this how Doom starts? Is this the beginning of Doom? No.

650
01:53:37,750 --> 01:54:10,539
Slurp. Well, alien. Welcome to the Doom Roguelike. Is that me? It's one of these.

651
01:54:11,100 --> 01:54:20,119
It's actually like an old school text-based adventure. There's a small med pack lying here.

652
01:54:20,119 --> 01:54:34,569
How do I pick it up? Unknown command. Oh shit. Getting stuck. Key bindings. Walk. Wait. Run.

653
01:54:34,569 --> 01:54:39,689
Go downstairs. Pick up item from floor is G. Drop item. Open. Close door. Toggle. Look

654
01:54:39,689 --> 01:54:46,779
boat. Fire equip weapon. Fire equip is F. You just tab to switch targets. So F and G

655
01:54:46,779 --> 01:55:02,760
are what we need right now. F and G. No. What are we doing? Escape exits. Does it? I can't

656
01:55:02,760 --> 01:55:30,600
get out. I can't get out of key bindings. I can't get out of here. Escape. No, it's not

657
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:42,779
backspace. It's escape. Well, hold on. Let me. What if I press escape again? There we go.

658
01:55:42,779 --> 01:55:48,699
Okay. It can't be in full screen. All right. We're good. We're back. So it was F and G,

659
01:55:48,699 --> 01:55:58,250
right? Picked up a small med pack. Small med pack. You see germa. Unhurt. You see floor.

660
01:55:59,909 --> 01:56:08,470
Fire. Choose target. Fire a more constructive way to commit suicide. Wait, what? Oh, I tried

661
01:56:08,470 --> 01:56:20,630
to shoot myself with a gun. Fire at the rock? Oh, fire. Okay, I see. Fire at the ground.

662
01:56:24,649 --> 01:56:37,529
I only have five bullets. I'm just testing my gun. I think that's a door up there,

663
01:56:37,529 --> 01:56:55,399
right? Okay, there's a door here. Press X to enable the music. There we go. Open the door. Boom.

664
01:56:56,520 --> 01:57:05,020
Hey, whoa! The former human fires. You're hit. You're bleeding. What human? This H? Since when

665
01:57:05,020 --> 01:57:08,939
did the Sesame Street letters stop fucking fighting each other? Okay, the former human.

666
01:57:08,939 --> 01:57:13,880
Fire. The missile hits the former human. You lose blood. The former human misses you.

667
01:57:16,300 --> 01:57:27,909
Fire. The missile hits the former human. The former human dies. Oh, god damn it. Okay,

668
01:57:27,989 --> 01:57:35,479
what do you have? There's 10 millimeter ammo. Grab. A former human fires. Another former human.

669
01:57:35,479 --> 01:57:47,720
Behind cover this time. Behind the door? The missile hits the former human. The former human

670
01:57:47,720 --> 01:57:55,739
hits you. Fire. The missile hits the former human. The former human dies. Fire. The

671
01:57:55,739 --> 01:57:59,260
former human. The former human. You hit the former human. The former human hits you.

672
01:57:59,260 --> 01:58:03,420
You hit the former human. There is 10 millimeter ammo lying here. You hit the former

673
01:58:03,420 --> 01:58:11,720

More. Former human sergeant wounded. The former. The missile hits the former human. The

684
01:59:29,659 --> 01:59:34,760

02:00:08,039 --> 02:00:19,899
shotgun. I'll take it. I want to equip the shotgun. Prepare the shotgun. Is it I? Small

691
02:00:19,899 --> 02:00:44,500
med pack. E. Did not. Son of a gun. Wait. Back it up. No items. I. F. I don't know why

692
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:59,180
that's not working. I. U. For use? To where will press the desired item letter? The F.

693
02:00:59,899 --> 02:01:10,819
That doesn't use it. How do I get out of here? I cleared this whole area. What is

694
02:01:11,060 --> 02:01:21,399
going to go down? Is there a staircase or something? It's the down arrow.

695
02:01:28,869 --> 02:01:40,840
It's the V. How do I go downstairs? I'm going to check the keybindings. C. Run on. Okay.

696
02:01:40,840 --> 02:01:46,149
Go downstairs. So it's actually that. You won't be able to come back. Drop item. Show

697
02:01:46,149 --> 02:01:51,510
inventory. Toggle look mode. Fire weapon reload. Special reload. Use item from

698
02:01:51,510 --> 02:02:08,010

All right. Okay. Let's go. I did it. You shiver from cold. What is the I? The imp

702
02:02:36,539 --> 02:02:48,949

708
02:03:16,090 --> 02:03:21,319
form of human sergeant reloads his shotgun. Get me out. What did I just do? What just

709
02:03:21,319 --> 02:03:30,229
exploded? The form of human sergeant fires as you die. He was reloading. I was trying

710
02:03:30,229 --> 02:03:41,270
to get in the room. I didn't level up. Yes I did. Level two on the bottom right. I

711
02:03:41,270 --> 02:03:58,039
leveled up. I leveled up. Map level two. I know it's the map. That was actually

712
02:03:58,039 --> 02:04:06,619
pretty cool. I didn't hate that. That was fun and interesting. All right. You

713
02:04:06,619 --> 02:04:11,350
know what time it is. Click the face if you want to scroll or click

714
02:04:11,350 --> 02:04:27,220
something else. Go for it. There's a version with graphics and sounds. All

715
02:04:27,220 --> 02:04:32,260
right. We got a little bit of a fight here between Batman Returns and

716
02:04:32,340 --> 02:05:01,260
Scroll please. 31 31. Don't make me have to flip the cork again. Dwarf Fortress.

717
02:05:07,529 --> 02:05:19,720
All right. Don't let the fucking scrollers win. Um anyone that's going to

718
02:05:19,720 --> 02:05:27,380
click on the screen has already done it. I think that's it. Five four three

719
02:05:28,119 --> 02:05:52,920
two one. That's it. Batman Returns. Thank you for voting. Batman Returns. Let's

720
02:05:52,920 --> 02:06:24,710
open it. Bitcoin miner. I've played this game before. This game sucks.

721
02:06:24,710 --> 02:06:37,619
I appreciate the fact that they made this in Mario Paint. All right. Anything

722
02:06:37,619 --> 02:06:49,189
else? Did I beat the game? It's just the song. It's just the song. That's

723
02:06:49,189 --> 02:06:59,739
it. All right. Next. That was fun. Game over. Guys enter doesn't do

724
02:06:59,739 --> 02:07:02,779
anything. I beat the game. We just had to hear the Mario Paint soundtrack.

725
02:07:02,779 --> 02:07:03,180
Game over.

726
02:07:43,369 --> 02:07:52,550
There's no way it's the before credits. I'm pressing enter x w q

727
02:07:54,359 --> 02:08:12,409
Chevrolet. Oh the after credit scene. Are you fucking kidding me? It's a

728
02:08:12,409 --> 02:08:21,739
point and click adventure game. Main computer. Oh my god you are slow as

729
02:08:21,739 --> 02:08:29,460
shit. Batman. Batman doing a great impression of I'm pretending to work

730
02:08:29,460 --> 02:08:37,880
at the office. All right. What? News broadcast. Evidence. Why is he dressed

731
02:08:37,880 --> 02:08:40,920
like Batman right now? You don't have to be dressed like Batman.

732
02:08:51,020 --> 02:08:54,619
This just in from Gotham Plaza. A gang of hooligans dressed as circus

733
02:08:54,619 --> 02:08:57,979
performers have attacked the crowd gathered to watch the annual tree

734
02:08:57,979 --> 02:09:01,659
lighting. Our communication lines in the area have been disrupted but as

735
02:09:01,659 --> 02:09:06,859
told the violence is is the city council released a report today

736
02:09:06,859 --> 02:09:09,500
predicting that the Gotham City will suffer a record deficit in this

737
02:09:09,500 --> 02:09:15,260
year's budget. Revenues are far below projections and high expenses are

738
02:09:15,260 --> 02:09:19,640
higher than expected. The slumping economy bears most of the blame

739
02:09:19,640 --> 02:09:25,239
according to the computer guy. What the control the crime is up. The

740
02:09:25,239 --> 02:09:30,680
temperatures are down and so are Gotham City's SAT scores according to the

741
02:09:30,680 --> 02:09:37,239
board of education. The average Gotham student score dropped by 25 points.

742
02:09:38,039 --> 02:09:41,800
No explanation was given for the sharp decline in scores. The arctic

743
02:09:41,800 --> 02:09:45,560
weather which has left Gotham City numb depressed and weary. A bunch of

744
02:09:45,560 --> 02:09:47,880
shows no signs of letting up according to the US weather bureau

745
02:09:47,880 --> 02:09:52,920
forecast. Life sucks right now. Temperatures will remain below freezing

746
02:09:52,920 --> 02:09:56,920
for at least a week with more snow a possibility. The long range forecast

747
02:09:56,920 --> 02:09:59,800
calls for below normal temperatures for the rest of the winter.

748
02:09:59,800 --> 02:10:03,319
Why is this the music we're playing on this broadcast? I have no idea. It's

749
02:10:03,319 --> 02:10:07,319
scary horror music. Unemployment continues to climb in Gotham City

750
02:10:07,319 --> 02:10:11,000
reaching a record high last month. Everything in the world sucks

751
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,800
according to a report from the human resource commission. The trend

752
02:10:13,800 --> 02:10:18,100
shows no sign of reversing. By the way a computerized forecast

753
02:10:18,100 --> 02:10:21,140
predict a controlled climb as the city loses an estimated

754
02:10:21,140 --> 02:10:24,810
thousand jobs each month. This just in from Gotham Plaza.

755
02:10:24,810 --> 02:10:28,090
In breaking news a gang of hooligans dressed as circus performers have attacked

756
02:10:28,090 --> 02:10:44,460
more people. Oh my god that was a lot. Evidence.

757
02:10:44,460 --> 02:10:52,470
What's in the evidence folder? Uh enter. No evidence to enter. How do

758
02:10:52,470 --> 02:11:05,510
you get evidence? Extrapolate. No evidence. Uh video.

759
02:11:05,510 --> 02:11:10,149
Select video. There are no videos. All right let's get out of here.

760
02:11:10,149 --> 02:11:22,970
Get up from your fucking gamer chair Batman. Let's go.

761
02:11:23,050 --> 02:11:27,050
Now where? Uh I can go this way. Wayne Manor.

762
02:11:27,050 --> 02:11:41,020
The vault of the garage. Garage. Now he runs. All right jump.

763
02:11:44,220 --> 02:11:49,739
What? But you watch TV. You're going to watch TV while you're driving.

764
02:11:49,739 --> 02:11:52,939
The city council released a report today predicting that Gotham City will

765
02:11:52,939 --> 02:11:55,340
suffer a record deficit in this year's budget.

766
02:11:55,340 --> 02:12:02,439
Revenues are far below projections. You don't.

767
02:12:02,439 --> 02:12:06,520
Why would you watch TV while you're driving?

768
02:12:06,520 --> 02:12:18,500
Two TVs. He's playing like Clash of Clans over here with his iPad.

769
02:12:18,500 --> 02:12:34,039
Batman injects from the Batmobile and he soars through the air.

770
02:12:34,279 --> 02:12:43,939
Oh the driverless Batmobile carries through the streets.

771
02:12:43,939 --> 02:13:02,119
Hitting people and...

772
02:13:17,770 --> 02:13:21,529
Why? Why can you ghost ride the Batmobile

773
02:13:21,529 --> 02:13:24,979
into people and into and explode it and shit?

774
02:13:24,979 --> 02:13:29,939
Oh they just didn't give a fuck.

775
02:13:30,659 --> 02:13:35,460
Oh that's the best game I've like ever played.

776
02:13:35,460 --> 02:13:40,279
I gotta see. We can't just leave right now.

777
02:13:40,279 --> 02:13:51,750
No. New game. I'm sorry that can't be how it ends.

778
02:13:51,750 --> 02:13:59,340
Let's check the vault. I want to see what's in here. How many batsuits does

779
02:13:59,340 --> 02:14:06,550
he have? Suit two defensive capability.

780
02:14:06,550 --> 02:14:12,600
Put on suit three? They're all the same thing.

781
02:14:12,600 --> 02:14:19,479
Why does he have a Peter Griffin closet of the same outfit?

782
02:14:19,479 --> 02:14:30,010
Utility belt computer. Grapple. Gauntlet. Rope. Knockout gas.

783
02:14:30,010 --> 02:14:41,939
Knockout gas. Rope. Smoke bomb.

784
02:14:41,939 --> 02:14:49,529
And a bolo batarang? How many can I take?

785
02:14:49,529 --> 02:14:58,979
Oh I can take like everything. All right.

786
02:14:58,979 --> 02:15:10,739
I'm decked out. So now let me just... Let's go to Wayne

787
02:15:10,739 --> 02:15:13,699
Manor. Have you completed everything you want

788
02:15:13,699 --> 02:15:19,350
to do on this day? No. Why is this like...

789
02:15:19,350 --> 02:15:22,970
We're gonna... Okay go back into the Batmobile.

790
02:15:22,970 --> 02:15:32,550
Two scanners. One for each hand. Yeah. What is this thing?

791
02:15:32,550 --> 02:15:36,229
Gotham Plaza mayor's office. Let's go downtown.

792
02:15:36,229 --> 02:15:48,020
What's going on downtown? Street. Time. It's 6 47 pm. Street.

793
02:15:48,020 --> 02:16:03,430
What is that? Is it a bird? Jewelry. Is it a robbery? What am I doing?

794
02:16:03,430 --> 02:16:10,279
Roof? Am I gonna steal from the jewelry store?

795
02:16:10,279 --> 02:16:19,060
He's looking through. I'm walking a tightrope. Doesn't Batman have

796
02:16:19,060 --> 02:16:42,149
gadgets? What's the point of doing this?

797
02:16:42,149 --> 02:16:46,950
He's just a cosplayer. This is not even real Batman.

798
02:16:46,950 --> 02:16:59,450
All right. I don't think I can do anything here. What?

799
02:16:59,450 --> 02:17:14,620
Why didn't you just do that over here? I don't even know where I am.

800
02:17:14,620 --> 02:17:28,469
I can't go this way. The only thing I can do is go back. I guess I could go

801
02:17:28,469 --> 02:17:42,969
to the street level from over here. Okay down to the street. Okay.

802
02:17:42,969 --> 02:17:53,059
Liquor sale. 50% off. Nobody here. All right. Back to the

803
02:17:53,139 --> 02:18:06,170
Batmobile. There's nobody here. Gotham Plaza. Oh my god. There's a bunch

804
02:18:06,170 --> 02:18:19,399
of people here. Shrek's. All right. Let's go around.

805
02:18:19,399 --> 02:18:38,489
It's not a yo-yo Batman. All right. Down to the street. What's going on?

806
02:18:38,489 --> 02:18:42,620
What the fuck is going on? How do I fight?

807
02:18:42,620 --> 02:18:47,100
I can't move the mouse up here. I can't fight this guy.

808
02:18:47,100 --> 02:19:05,540
It's just easy. Normal. Fierce. Fierce. Yes, I want to interrogate.

809
02:19:05,540 --> 02:19:13,700
Category of the question. Batman is high as fuck right now. Now I get it.

810
02:19:13,700 --> 02:19:19,850
A leader. Tell me who you're working for.

811
02:19:19,850 --> 02:19:23,989
A real fish lover, that's for sure. Try one.

812
02:19:23,989 --> 02:19:30,299
What? Another fight.

813
02:19:30,299 --> 02:19:38,620
I don't know what any of these do. Smoke bomb.

814
02:19:38,620 --> 02:19:55,129
I'd stomp. Is there any more?

815
02:19:55,129 --> 02:20:04,629
This music's gonna kill me. What time is it? It's 7 50 p.m.

816
02:20:04,629 --> 02:20:19,129
Did I kill these people? Go up. Wrap back around.

817
02:20:19,209 --> 02:20:30,299
Oh my god. No one's here. It's a fish for sure, right? What is it?

818
02:20:30,299 --> 02:20:40,120
Clue? Oh, here we go. Satan? He's dead. I

819
02:20:40,120 --> 02:20:56,420
killed him. These are all lethal somehow. I think

820
02:20:56,420 --> 02:21:11,850
I cleared them. Back to the Bat

821
02:21:11,850 --> 02:21:20,579
mobile. I got some intel. What about the news?

822
02:21:20,579 --> 02:21:23,780
Hey, let me take my eyes off the road. The riot which broke out in the

823
02:21:23,780 --> 02:21:28,010
plaza several hours ago has now spread to the downtown area.

824
02:21:28,010 --> 02:21:31,770
Costumed monitors are terrorizing citizens and wrecking property throughout

825
02:21:31,770 --> 02:21:35,860
downtown. Police seem unable to quell disturbances.

826
02:21:35,860 --> 02:21:38,340
The city council released a report today predicting that Gotham City will

827
02:21:38,340 --> 02:21:40,659
suffer a record deficit in this year's budget.

828
02:21:40,659 --> 02:21:43,940
In case you forgot, revenues are fucked.

829
02:21:43,940 --> 02:21:56,940
No one's making any money. Jobs are gone. Okay, downtown.

830
02:21:56,940 --> 02:22:15,559
I don't have any more equipment left. Yeah, I do.

831
02:22:15,639 --> 02:22:21,770
Just, just punch him. Punch him in the face. Fierce.

832
02:22:21,770 --> 02:22:30,260
I keep killing them. I need to interrogate them, so just knock them out.

833
02:22:30,260 --> 02:22:34,540
Come on, Batman. This person's not even attacking. Just punch them.

834
02:22:34,540 --> 02:22:42,200
Just punch, just punch her in the face. Just punch them in the face.

835
02:22:42,200 --> 02:23:01,399
Oh, I guess so. Oops. Use the bat gun. No, I don't want to hurt. I want to

836
02:23:01,399 --> 02:23:13,670
interrogate somebody. No, they're gone. There's nobody here.

837
02:23:13,670 --> 02:23:21,100
All right, get me out of here. I need more news.

838
02:23:21,100 --> 02:23:24,780
Crime is up, the temperatures are down, and so Gotham City's SAT scores. This

839
02:23:24,780 --> 02:23:28,620
guy just can't get over that. I'm not going to eject. All right, how

840
02:23:28,620 --> 02:23:33,049
do I get back to, like, I gotta go back to Wayne Manor.

841
02:23:33,049 --> 02:23:49,799
Bat cave. Mayor's office? What's on here?

842
02:23:49,799 --> 02:23:59,100
Evidence? Nothing. Oh, there ain't nothing here.

843
02:23:59,100 --> 02:24:03,899
Go back to, just go back to Wayne Manor and end the day. Get back in

844
02:24:03,899 --> 02:24:08,309
your car. Yeah, just broke into the Mayor's

845
02:24:08,309 --> 02:24:17,399
house. All right, back to Wayne Manor. Let's end the day.

846
02:24:17,399 --> 02:24:27,030
Does he ever take off the suit? Wait, evidence, right?

847
02:24:27,030 --> 02:24:38,139
I learned about the fish. Okay, evidence.

848
02:24:38,139 --> 02:24:41,979
Evidence. Enter evidence. Frozen fish. Collected evidence. Entered.

849
02:24:41,979 --> 02:24:47,659
Okay, a few frozen fish. Species Simonus frigidus,

850
02:24:47,659 --> 02:24:51,399
native to the icy waters off the coast of Antarctica.

851
02:24:51,399 --> 02:24:58,709
Okay, extrapolate. Not eaten by people used primarily as food for arctic avian

852
02:24:58,709 --> 02:25:01,750
species such as penguins. Only known for

853
02:25:01,829 --> 02:25:06,840
very obvious fish in Gotham City is Tony's fish market. Evidence.

854
02:25:06,840 --> 02:25:21,909
All right, go to bed. All right, Wayne Manor, end the day.

855
02:25:21,909 --> 02:25:33,500
A new day begins day two. Let's go. We've got the evidence we need.

856
02:25:33,500 --> 02:25:45,159
I'm gonna go to the fish market. Fish market.

857
02:25:45,159 --> 02:25:56,180
Interrogate. There he is. Batman, what can I do for you?

858
02:25:56,180 --> 02:26:02,170
I understand that you sell fish called Simonus frigidus.

859
02:26:02,170 --> 02:26:09,430
Yeah, what about him? Sold any recently?

860
02:26:09,430 --> 02:26:18,469
A couple of days ago. I sent a crate load over in the old zoo about once a week.

861
02:26:18,469 --> 02:26:24,200
Zoo. Thanks for your help. Zoo sounds...

862
02:26:24,200 --> 02:26:46,489
Sorry, I'm so fucking high right now. Zoo? Did you say zoo? Old Gotham Zoo.

863
02:26:46,489 --> 02:26:50,069
Arctic world. Well, what else is over here?

864
02:26:50,069 --> 02:26:54,899
Oh, a videotape. Take it. Take the tape.

865
02:27:03,159 --> 02:27:16,420
We have some evidence now. Oh, what's this? Circus poster. Take it.

866
02:27:16,420 --> 02:27:22,760
All right. Oh wait, we're gonna fight a clown. Normal.

867
02:27:22,760 --> 02:27:32,940
I don't care if this guy dies. Just kill him. Just batarang him in the head.

868
02:27:32,940 --> 02:27:39,500
Try something else. Anything else will do.

869
02:27:39,500 --> 02:27:48,010
Anything will do. Both of you. I think we froze to death down here.

870
02:27:48,010 --> 02:27:59,690
Would you like to interrogate? Yes. Location.

871
02:28:00,090 --> 02:28:08,329
Where can I find your boss? He'll be visiting the bank tonight making a withdrawal.

872
02:28:09,049 --> 02:28:21,459
Okay. I'll be sure to stop him.

873
02:28:42,540 --> 02:28:47,340
Bank. Where's the bank? Where's the bank? Mayor's office downtown.

874
02:28:48,059 --> 02:29:03,940
Gotham Plaza. Fish market. Where's the bank? Is the bank on this side or the other side?

875
02:29:04,739 --> 02:29:17,829
Jewelry. Do the music louder or am I fucking insane?

876
02:29:17,829 --> 02:29:24,790
You might not be insane. I think it just hurts to listen to this or it just

877
02:29:24,790 --> 02:29:42,120
feels like it's getting louder. Bank. 750... Am I early? I'm too early.

878
02:29:45,879 --> 02:30:01,659
759. Is this real time? 801. Is it eight? What time did they do this?

879
02:30:01,659 --> 02:30:15,059
I can skip time? How do you do that?

880
02:30:20,469 --> 02:30:24,149
Advance. An hour. Two hours. Return to game.

881
02:30:24,709 --> 02:30:38,250
All right. Are they here? Let's go. It's 10... 11 o'clock.

882
02:30:42,940 --> 02:30:53,940
Here we go. It's the penguin. He's a cunt. Quick throw a batarang in his eye.

883
02:30:55,319 --> 02:30:58,360
He blocked it. Fierce. Get in there. Get in there and stop punching.

884
02:31:01,030 --> 02:31:05,909
Why is the penguin this good at fighting? The penguin's not supposed to be this good.

885
02:31:07,139 --> 02:31:11,930
Fierce. Get in there, Batman. Take him out. All right. A couple more of those.

886
02:31:12,729 --> 02:31:15,129
Why is he here by himself walking in the front door?

887
02:31:21,579 --> 02:31:26,709
Don't you think you would do something differently here in Justice 3?

888
02:31:30,069 --> 02:31:36,389
All right. Please don't lose this. How many punches in the face is the penguin gonna take?

889
02:31:48,870 --> 02:31:55,930
End this. Don't let him get the best of you. If the penguin can beat Batman in a one-on-one

890
02:31:55,930 --> 02:32:07,209
combat scenario, it might be time to retire. There you go. Get in.

891
02:32:07,209 --> 02:32:37,030
Is Fierce the... Okay. His top henchmen. Here come the clowns. Why can I do this so well?

892
02:32:37,030 --> 02:32:41,510
I just... I did a backflip off of his face. I'm doing like weird karate mortal combat

893
02:32:41,510 --> 02:32:46,069
moves and shit now. I was afraid... Look at these moves. Why was I not doing these before?

894
02:32:57,590 --> 02:33:04,920
Oh, would you like to interrogate? Yes. I want the location.

895
02:33:04,920 --> 02:33:11,239
I want your boss. Where is he? Where is he?

896
02:33:12,520 --> 02:33:15,959
I don't know, but he'll be making a withdrawal later tonight at the bank.

897
02:33:15,959 --> 02:33:26,420
Later tonight? At the bank? Okay. Where is he? What time is it? 1130? Okay.

898
02:33:40,870 --> 02:33:44,860
Uh-oh. Mirror match. I chose...

899
02:33:48,620 --> 02:33:53,180
That was a backflip. I punched you so hard you did a full backflip.

900
02:33:59,190 --> 02:34:08,940
This is an old lady. This is clearly a grandma. Just push her over. Push her. Just shove.

901
02:34:09,659 --> 02:34:19,270
What's this? What's going on? Why is this blinking red? Why is my stone blinking?

902
02:34:20,659 --> 02:34:30,540
What does this mean? Is this a bomb? No. I don't know what that means. I have to wait at the bank.

903
02:34:31,260 --> 02:34:38,979
What time is it? It's 1150. He's going to make a withdrawal. I just have to hold on.

904
02:34:39,540 --> 02:34:56,389
All right. Wait an hour. Okay. Here comes the withdrawal. Here we go. Here he comes.

905
02:34:57,590 --> 02:35:05,659
I came back. I forgot. I was going to deposit a few checks too, Batman.

906
02:35:06,379 --> 02:35:22,549
Bruce, you might want to do something here. Bruce, get in there. Easy. Should I put it on easy?

907
02:35:23,430 --> 02:35:37,510
No, this is too defensive. Get in there. Normal. You are so bad. Fierce. At least you were

908
02:35:37,510 --> 02:35:51,819
landing shots. How many times do I have to hit him? I think I have to put... Okay. I know

909
02:35:51,819 --> 02:35:54,940
what I have to do. I got to put it on easy when he attacks because that means I block

910
02:35:55,899 --> 02:36:17,260
and then go back to fierce. What a bullshit strategy that's working. It's not fair.

911
02:36:17,260 --> 02:36:21,819
Look at that reach. Batman, do something. Anything would be... I would take anything at

912
02:36:21,819 --> 02:36:38,600
this point. I'm just relying on dodge rolls. Get in there. Finally. Punch. Oh my god.

913
02:36:49,270 --> 02:36:53,459
Where is he? Oh, he's going to be making a deposit later tonight.

914
02:36:54,260 --> 02:37:13,059
It's fucking 12 30. Batman's going on no sleep. No, they're gone. All right. Back to the... I

915
02:37:13,059 --> 02:37:41,399
gotta watch the videotape. Put the tape in. Let's see what it is. Remember that time when

916
02:37:41,399 --> 02:37:50,540
Batman fought the penguin for three hours outside of a bank twice? Okay. Video. Select

917
02:37:50,540 --> 02:37:59,860
video. No, do I have to administer evidence? Okay. Enter evidence. Red triangle circus

918
02:37:59,860 --> 02:38:12,680
poster videotape from zoo. Collected evidence. Entered. Video from the zoo. Play. My god.

919
02:38:13,239 --> 02:38:24,329
The penguin man of the sewers. What? Shut up Max. You know you and I have a lot in common.

920
02:38:25,479 --> 02:38:37,079
We do? Of course. We both crave respect and power. You can never have too much power.

921
02:38:37,079 --> 02:38:45,110
You're right. I've been hiding in the sewers for too long. It's time for me to ascend.

922
02:38:46,780 --> 02:38:54,069
And I want your help. I think I can work out a welcome home scenario that will benefit both of us.

923
02:38:59,100 --> 02:39:05,370
Transmit to the police. Wait, who am I transmitting to? Am I putting this on TV?

924
02:39:06,250 --> 02:39:25,500
Did I just pump into every cable box? Quick, put it on the air. It'll embarrass them. I guess

925
02:39:25,500 --> 02:39:36,059
I'm transmitting this. Yeah, why were they recording this? Why would you re record your

926
02:39:36,059 --> 02:39:46,579
damning conversation? Yeah, they're standing very okay. I did it. I transmitted it. Apparently.

927
02:39:47,139 --> 02:39:55,500
We've got big bits coming in. Cure. Cure, thank you for the $55. Cure. 55 bucks.

928
02:39:56,790 --> 02:40:03,479
Huge money drop right here. Cure says, hey, I love it when you play shitty old games. Brings

929
02:40:03,479 --> 02:40:07,639
me back. You're me and my brother's favorite person on the internet. I've been watching

930
02:40:07,639 --> 02:40:12,010
you for a long time and it seems like you just keep getting funnier. Keep being you. As long

931
02:40:12,010 --> 02:40:15,209
as you having fun. We always are right there with you laughing our asses off.

932
02:40:15,209 --> 02:40:18,250
Thanks for the years of free laughs. Here's me giving back a little. Thank you so much.

933
02:40:22,010 --> 02:40:30,389
That means a fucking lot. Thank you. It's my pleasure. And yes, I do have a lot of fun

934
02:40:30,389 --> 02:40:41,049
when we play these games. Thank you so much Cure. Say hello to your brother for me too.

935
02:40:41,290 --> 02:40:49,860
So, and that Batman music just like blasting in the background.

936
02:40:49,860 --> 02:40:57,510
All right, I get this is gonna drive you crazy. Um, videotaping is one of the two

937
02:40:57,510 --> 02:41:01,430
principals apparently likes to keep a video record of his meetings. They have formed

938
02:41:01,430 --> 02:41:05,989
an alliance and appear ready to use devious means to gain power. When he videotapes

939
02:41:05,989 --> 02:41:13,110
every meeting, I would not be okay with that. There are many rumors linking the red triangle

940
02:41:13,110 --> 02:41:16,389
circus to criminal activity. It's likely that at least some of the members turn to crime

941
02:41:17,030 --> 02:41:19,989
full-time with the circus characters involved in the ride of the plaza.

942
02:41:20,549 --> 02:41:28,579
Let's see what's on the news today. Another La Crona just gave 50 dollars.

943
02:41:31,209 --> 02:41:35,770
Oswald Cobblepot foiled a kidnap attempt on the mayor. Little is known about Cobblepot's

944
02:41:35,770 --> 02:41:39,530
background. He appears to suffer from a congenital deformity that gives him a very

945
02:41:39,530 --> 02:41:46,819
penguin-like appearance. The arctic weather which has left Gothamites numb, depressed,

946
02:41:46,819 --> 02:41:53,829
and weary. What? Now we're going in this loop again. Uh, La Crona says eject. 50 dollars.

947
02:41:53,829 --> 02:42:07,540
Thank you. Back-to-back 50 bucks. Thank you, both of you. Uh, okay. Let's- I'm not gonna eject.

948
02:42:08,100 --> 02:42:14,069
I'm gonna go to the vault. I could- I have to replace my bat suit. This one's broken.

949
02:42:14,629 --> 02:42:29,989
See, look. Ready? 100 percent, 100 percent, right? 70- Offensive capability zero. What do

950
02:42:29,989 --> 02:42:41,129
you mean zero? Is this suit made out of concrete? I don't get it. Wait, there's a

951
02:42:41,129 --> 02:42:55,370
link that I need to look at? You went too hard. Hold on. Wait, a link I need to look at. Wait,

952
02:42:55,370 --> 02:43:13,139
wait, wait. What's the link? You even put my nose bump in that photo- in the image.

953
02:43:15,540 --> 02:43:27,450
That's the best part about that. All right, here we go. We need to go to sleep. I'm

954
02:43:27,450 --> 02:43:34,059
gonna give this game like another 15 minutes. I don't know how much more of this I can take.

955
02:43:48,010 --> 02:43:55,030
Okay, and we have the mayor's house. Gotham Plaza mayor's office.

956
02:43:56,229 --> 02:44:05,270
We're gonna go to the mayor's office. What time is it? 6 p.m. He's not here. Just wait here.

957
02:44:06,899 --> 02:44:21,700
Oh, hold on. Party pictures. Scan. Scan them. Scan. Just take them. All right, I got some

958
02:44:21,700 --> 02:44:37,350
evidence here. All right, get me the fuck out of this. I don't want to look at his desk

959
02:44:37,350 --> 02:45:01,959
anymore. Okay, pictures. What's in the pictures? Does he take photos of himself, too? Is it weird

960
02:45:01,959 --> 02:45:07,770
that I want to do this again on the next stream? I feel like we're just touching the ice break

961
02:45:07,770 --> 02:45:25,930
here. Evidence. Oh, maybe like do it next weekend, too? Okay, uh, enter. Photos of

962
02:45:25,930 --> 02:45:39,739
the mayor's son. A pack of photos of the mayor's son's birthday party. No useful extrapolation

963
02:45:39,739 --> 02:45:50,219
can be made at this time. I think, I think we've, I don't know what to do.

964
02:45:51,100 --> 02:45:56,760
I don't know what else to do. Watch the news. Unemployment. No, we already know about the

965
02:45:56,760 --> 02:46:14,579
unemployment. No, not the SATs again. What the hell is there a reason for the eject button?

966
02:46:14,579 --> 02:46:19,540
There is no reason for the eject button. It doesn't, it just explodes the car. All right,

967
02:46:20,340 --> 02:46:27,379
last day. Make it count. Gotham Zoo. Batcave. Mayor's office. Downtown.

968
02:46:28,100 --> 02:46:55,579
Fish market. Let's go downtown. Nobody here. Steal something. I can't. I'm Batman. Batman

969
02:46:55,579 --> 02:47:03,260
doesn't steal. What about over here? We saw a light just turn off there. Down to the street.

970
02:47:03,899 --> 02:47:09,059
If there's nothing here, then we're going to move on. I don't think this, I think,

971
02:47:09,059 --> 02:47:15,659
I think we're stuck. We have to do something specific. Yeah, I think that's it. I think

972
02:47:15,659 --> 02:47:23,799
that's it. It was fun. One more try. I'm going to go to the fish market.

973
02:47:24,520 --> 02:47:38,629
They closed. Ah, damn it. What time is it? 8 58. They close at nine. Bullshit. God,

974
02:47:38,629 --> 02:48:07,239
I drove all the way out here. Fuck it. Well, that's it for that one. Well, thank you,

975
02:48:07,239 --> 02:48:12,889
Batman Returns for the, probably the hardest I've laughed in two or three weeks at least.

976
02:48:13,690 --> 02:51:57,260
That was a classic. I am going to go pee. I'll be right back. Hello. So, yeah, I think

977
02:52:00,229 --> 02:52:11,020
uh, what do you guys think? This is what I think. It's uh, 4,400 games. That's uh,

978
02:52:13,299 --> 02:52:24,420
I feel like we could make this like a Saturday night thing. You know what I'm saying? At least

979
02:52:24,420 --> 02:52:30,139
for like a couple weeks. Just do I have to have this be just something fun to do like

980
02:52:30,139 --> 02:52:44,920
Saturday night? Just to check out some old DOS games, you know, whatever. On top of other

981
02:52:44,920 --> 02:52:51,450
streams, right? Because this, this is four this week. So I don't see why I wouldn't do this

982
02:52:51,450 --> 02:52:59,739
again. This is fucking, no, I'm having, this is a lot of fun. Maybe not permanently,

983
02:52:59,739 --> 02:53:05,559
but at least for like the next maybe two or three weeks. Try it. But uh, speaking of stuff,

984
02:53:05,559 --> 02:53:15,850
I, here we go. We were, uh, we did not choose to scroll. We were right here.

985
02:53:15,850 --> 02:53:21,670
The last one was Batman, right? We didn't choose to scroll. Was it here or was it,

986
02:53:21,670 --> 02:53:34,620
it was here, right? Uh, let's keep going. Probably gonna drop a lot of frames.

987
02:53:35,989 --> 02:53:41,459
Another reason why I started an hour or two early, because I'm trying to beat the internet problems

988
02:53:41,459 --> 02:53:47,670
that start at like five to six, seven o'clock. So at this point, we're probably going to start

989
02:53:47,670 --> 02:53:55,340
dropping frames. Apologize in advance, but let me get the thing here. If you want to scroll

990
02:53:56,059 --> 02:54:13,579
down another set of pages. Here we go. Are you ready? Click the screen. Don't use the image.

991
02:54:15,989 --> 02:54:19,670
I'll, I'll make it something else after this. Just so people like, oh, I'm going to click the face,

992
02:54:19,670 --> 02:54:32,040
right? I see what you're saying. Here, while you guys do that, I'll do this.

993
02:54:59,219 --> 02:55:12,659
This means scroll. So, uh, what are we doing here? I think we're scrolling. I think we're

994
02:55:12,659 --> 02:55:29,690
doing a scroll. We are. Stop it for now. We're doing one full scroll to here, which

995
02:55:29,690 --> 02:55:37,590
gives us this new set. And let's wait, wait, wait, rigged, rigged, what time? Wait, what

996
02:55:37,590 --> 02:55:49,620
happened? Rigged. What are you talking about? Was it, it was 30, like three percent, right?

997
02:55:49,620 --> 02:56:07,829
Hold on. Did I, did I fuck that up? 70% was not voting. Reset the vote. Okay. No, no,

998
02:56:07,829 --> 02:56:10,549
you're right. Okay. Okay. All right. I see what you're saying. I see what you're saying. No,

999
02:56:10,549 --> 02:56:19,459
I see what you're saying. You're right. No, you're right. You're right. You're right.

1000
02:56:19,459 --> 02:56:32,059
Because I, there are people that may have just clicked the face. Well, if there was

1001
02:56:32,700 --> 02:56:44,549
ever any indication of what people wanted, I think we've got a clear indicator now.

1002
02:56:44,549 --> 02:56:58,680
I don't think this is one guy. I think this might be, uh, 58% of all one guys in the chat.

1003
02:56:58,680 --> 02:57:15,829
58% of guys. All right. That's very clear. Let's go again here. All right. By the way,

1004
02:57:15,829 --> 02:57:28,149
this is off. I'm not doing this one. X. X that one. I'm not doing that one either.

1005
02:57:28,149 --> 02:57:43,370
Not doing, not doing that one. Good thing I caught that. No way. Not playing soft porn,

1006
02:57:43,370 --> 02:57:57,079
too. You're wasting your vote right now. We must know. And my channel, if you understand,

1007
02:57:57,079 --> 02:58:03,690
I can't stream porn on Twitch. I don't know if you've ever read the terms of service,

1008
02:58:03,690 --> 02:58:12,100
but porno porn is not streamable. Uh, even if it is probably like two bits that are,

1009
02:58:15,430 --> 02:58:23,239
it's just text. You think I can roll those dice? I don't know what that is. It could be

1010
02:58:23,239 --> 02:58:33,500
like a good flashing image of like something crazy. No, I ain't clicking that. I'm not clicking on

1011
02:58:33,500 --> 02:58:42,709
porn. Now you got, I'm telling, that's it. Monopoly Deluxe is the winner. No, no, no, no.

1012
02:58:42,709 --> 02:58:53,799
Sorry. Sorry. Sim Ant. I already played Sim Ant. No, Veto, two Vetos. I played Sim Ant like

1013
02:58:53,799 --> 02:59:01,620
three weeks ago. No, I played Sim Ant like a year ago. You want me to play Sim Ant again?

1014
02:59:02,579 --> 02:59:12,219
All right. All right. Well, I'll put up Sim Ant. That's the one. I'm not clicking the porn one.

1015
02:59:13,659 --> 02:59:22,170
Three weeks is a year. No porn. All it takes is for one thing to flash on that screen.

1016
02:59:22,729 --> 02:59:28,809
And bingo. I'll see you guys in two weeks because I get terms of service banned.

1017
02:59:33,899 --> 02:59:42,819
Sim Ant. We're not going to report you. All right. Sim Ant. This copy of Sim Ant is

1018
02:59:42,819 --> 02:59:56,520
registered to Robert. I don't know who that is. That's not me. Stolen.

1019
03:00:11,340 --> 03:00:19,370
I don't know how to play tutorial. Welcome to the Sim Ant tutorial. Just follow the on-screen

1020
03:00:19,370 --> 03:00:25,979
instructions and you will learn how to play the game. All right. In Sim Ant, you are the

1021
03:00:25,979 --> 03:00:30,379
yellow ant that you see in the window before you. First, you will learn to control your ant.

1022
03:00:31,260 --> 03:00:37,350
Try double clicking somewhere in the brown dirt near the yellow ant.

1023
03:00:38,149 --> 03:00:46,069
Is that the queen? Good. You've just learned how to dig a tunnel. Try digging some more to get the

1024
03:00:46,069 --> 03:01:06,860
hang of it. What's wrong? What are you doing? Now go outside and explore the surface. Double

1025
03:01:06,860 --> 03:01:09,579
click on the blue area at the top of the window to dig a tunnel to the surface.

1026
03:01:10,379 --> 03:01:18,120
Oh, shit. Okay. Now you're outside. This is called the surface view. You can die up here.

1027
03:01:18,760 --> 03:01:25,690
To move in the surface, just click on the ground and you'll move. All right. Yeah, I can

1028
03:01:25,690 --> 03:01:40,870
move around. When do we get raid? Hey. Hey, easy. That's right. Now click on your ant to

1029
03:01:40,870 --> 03:01:51,540
re-send to the window. Just go off on an adventure. Good. Now here's another way to scroll the screen.

1030
03:01:51,540 --> 03:02:07,610
Move the mouse cursor to the far edge of the screen. Yep. Yep. Yep. Oh, boy. Now it's about

1031
03:02:07,610 --> 03:02:23,430
time to find some food for your colony. Under the window menu, select MAP. The window is a

1032
03:02:23,430 --> 03:02:28,620
view of the whole patch. The green dots in this window are food. The yellow dot is your

1033
03:02:28,620 --> 03:02:36,680
ant. You may see other things moving too. Eject. Get a bearing on which way the food

1034
03:02:36,680 --> 03:02:40,600
is located in the patch. Then select edit under the window menu to bring up the close-up

1035
03:02:40,600 --> 03:02:50,500
view of the surface again. All right. So I gotta go right. They're gonna go this way. There it is.

1036
03:02:51,219 --> 03:02:52,569
Try to get some of the food.

1037
03:03:06,010 --> 03:03:11,340
All right. I got the food. Very good. You made it. You are probably hungry by now,

1038
03:03:11,340 --> 03:03:20,729
so double click on a piece of food. That tasted good, didn't it? Now you feel like a new ant.

1039
03:03:21,290 --> 03:03:27,860
Now it's time to bring a piece of food back to your colony. Double click on another

1040
03:03:27,860 --> 03:03:31,379
piece of food. Pick it up. Would you guys just let me get through the damn tutorial?

1041
03:03:37,079 --> 03:03:42,680
What? Like, let me just at least do that. This is what was voted on. You have to give it at least

1042
03:03:42,680 --> 03:03:48,680
a few minutes. We can't just be like, I want you to play SimAnt. Get out of SimAnt quick.

1043
03:03:49,899 --> 03:03:56,870
You put me to sleep. All right. So I have a piece of food. We voted for soft porn. Yeah.

1044
03:03:56,870 --> 03:04:01,799
All right. You know, that's true. You're right. You wanted soft porn too. I'm gonna do it.

1045
03:04:01,799 --> 03:04:11,319
I'm gonna turn the screen off and I'm gonna see what it is. What was that? Now pick up

1046
03:04:11,319 --> 03:04:18,360
the food. Wait, watch out. He's coming after me. He's coming after me. He's chasing me.

1047
03:04:18,360 --> 03:04:38,540
Hit the food up. All right. I need a map. Where's the colony? I don't remember what my

1048
03:04:38,540 --> 03:04:44,729
colony is. It's up here. Colony. Found it. Good. Try to get back to your nest. It should

1049
03:04:44,729 --> 03:04:53,340
be somewhere to the left. Yeah, it's right here. All right. I got food. Food. This is

1050
03:04:53,340 --> 03:05:04,620
food for you. Double click the tunnel to drop the food. Try a few more things. Just hold

1051
03:05:04,620 --> 03:05:07,579
on. I'm interested in it for a second. You're gonna get your porn game in a few minutes.

1052
03:05:07,579 --> 03:05:24,329
Hold on. Look for a small rock that looks like this. This is cool. Build crude walls

1053
03:05:25,129 --> 03:05:31,819
for defense. A shitload of them just showed up. Click and hold on your ant and select recruit

1054
03:05:32,540 --> 03:05:45,000
10 from the pop-up menu. Recruit 10. I got. Oh yeah. You thought this was gonna be boring?

1055
03:05:45,639 --> 03:06:02,440
Take a look at this. I got an army now. We're gonna go fight the red ants. Where's

1056
03:06:02,440 --> 03:06:09,350
their colony? Tap the zero key. No. I want to see where they are. There they are. Let's go.

1057
03:06:10,069 --> 03:06:19,430
Let's fuck them up. Let's get in there. Just get the queen immediately.

1058
03:06:19,430 --> 03:06:41,510
In. Invade. Invade. I'll find another. You have been reborn and the stream continues.

1059
03:06:48,549 --> 03:07:10,979
All right. Sim ant. Sim ant. Sim ant. Never gonna stop playing this. This drops a cent.

1060
03:07:10,979 --> 03:07:30,780
Sim ant. Sim ant. Sim ant. Never going to stop streaming. Sim ant. Engage. Engage. Exchange

1061
03:07:30,780 --> 03:07:43,819
bodies. Now you're in. You control any black ant with this command. Okay. What's this thing?

1062
03:07:43,819 --> 03:07:56,889
Can we kill this thing? All right. Back to the map. Okay. You got one more minute here

1063
03:07:56,889 --> 03:08:06,969
for me just to check it out. This game's cool. You guys don't like this game?

1064
03:08:06,969 --> 03:08:14,120
Where you are in the world of Sim Ant. Click on the yard icon. Oh shit. This is somebody's

1065
03:08:14,120 --> 03:08:25,860
yard. You can only transfer to a new patch in a full game. This plans for zombies. We're

1066
03:08:25,860 --> 03:08:32,659
going to invade the house. The screen is where you will reproduce and spread new

1067
03:08:32,659 --> 03:08:41,620
colonies across the yard. Just watch out for the lawnmower. Now click on the bottom labeled

1068
03:08:41,620 --> 03:08:50,979
house. Can we infest the house? Guys, we can infest the house. You're objectively to invade

1069
03:08:50,979 --> 03:09:15,020
and take over the inside of this house. You don't. Okay. That's pretty cool. Okay. B. Behavior

1070
03:09:15,020 --> 03:09:31,340
control. Dig. One minute. It's got like 30 seconds left. This is really cool. I highly recommend

1071
03:09:31,340 --> 03:09:51,579
Sim Ant. This is fun. This is actually pretty cool. Now let's play porn. Oh, they're coming

1072
03:09:51,579 --> 03:09:55,780
to steal our food. Wait a minute. I can't stand for this. Look, they're taking all

1073
03:09:55,780 --> 03:10:03,110
of our food. Get over here. How do I? Oh, I get this is my last thing I'm doing. No,

1074
03:10:03,110 --> 03:10:14,219
I don't. Hold on. Wait. Recruit 10. Get over here. More. Recruit 10. There's only one

1075
03:10:14,219 --> 03:10:26,760
here. They're taking all of our food. Get over there. There we go. All right. Charge

1076
03:10:26,760 --> 03:10:39,299
in. Let's go. Get them. Scare them off. Come on. All of you. Somebody fight this guy

1077
03:10:39,299 --> 03:10:50,899
so I don't. I've been reborn. The counter resets. No, this is all right. This is

1078
03:10:50,899 --> 03:10:59,180
fun. I like it. Next. That's fun. The red ants are too powerful. It's okay. Get

1079
03:10:59,180 --> 03:11:03,989
that off screen. This is fun. This is cool. I recommend it. Go play it and tell me how

1080
03:11:03,989 --> 03:11:08,780
it is. I'm going to click the porn game now. I'm going to turn the audio off. I need

1081
03:11:08,780 --> 03:11:17,260
to. I'm just going to see what this is. Okay. I'm clicking on soft porn 2. I'm

1082
03:11:17,260 --> 03:11:32,219
opening soft porn 2. Okay. Hit any key. This program contains explicit material

1083
03:11:32,219 --> 03:11:40,389
that may be found offensive. Are you over 18? Do you wish to continue? Do you

1084
03:11:40,389 --> 03:12:07,639
need instructions? I can't show this. There's a whole list of commands. Just

1085
03:12:07,639 --> 03:12:12,280
say what's on screen. Well, the program collects relevant information regarding

1086
03:12:12,280 --> 03:12:16,940
you and your partner. You direct the action by giving commands such as

1087
03:12:22,489 --> 03:12:37,139
something. Have her something something. Have her something my wand. Don't get

1088
03:12:37,139 --> 03:12:43,340
discouraged if you wipe out on the first couple tries. This is much more

1089
03:12:43,340 --> 03:12:50,120
complex and much more difficult than soft porn 1. There are 22 different

1090
03:12:50,120 --> 03:13:03,370
endings and only one is the real winner. All right. How about this? I will show

1091
03:13:03,370 --> 03:13:17,290
you guys the TV edit of this game. Okay. Here comes the TV edit and hold on.

1092
03:13:17,290 --> 03:13:27,180
Vilemi gave $53. Forget soft porn 2. Give us Jazz Jackrabbit. Thank you for

1093
03:13:27,180 --> 03:13:37,430
the 53 bucks. We're going to do the made for TV soft porn 2. Okay. What is

1094
03:13:37,430 --> 03:13:56,620
your name in this story? I'm not using my real name. Dave. Yes. Um, I

1095
03:13:56,620 --> 03:14:08,459
don't know. Uh, Cindy. Carol. Carol. What color is Carol's hair? Um, I don't

1096
03:14:08,459 --> 03:14:27,829
know. Uh, bra bra brown. Brown. The color of Carol's eyes. Uh, red. What

1097
03:14:27,829 --> 03:14:56,420
is Carol's? Um, I don't know. I don't see what. Um, I don't I don't I don't

1098
03:14:56,739 --> 03:15:07,989
know. Seven, eight, 19. I don't know what that means. 19. Uh, one. I don't

1099
03:15:07,989 --> 03:15:18,899
know. I, why do they want, am I tailoring a suit for this person? I

1100
03:15:18,899 --> 03:15:38,229
don't. Um, 32. If you want a freak show, go to the circus. Well, one.

1101
03:15:38,229 --> 03:15:48,340
What is Carol's hair? I don't know. Eight, six, five, four. What is this?

1102
03:15:48,340 --> 03:16:00,790
What is Carol? 19 waist measurement. Six hip measurement. Six. I don't know

1103
03:16:00,790 --> 03:16:06,790
measurements. I don't know. I don't know what it is. I know I'm a 32. What

1104
03:16:06,790 --> 03:16:09,750
is Carol's bust measurement? I don't know. I've never measured a bust

1105
03:16:09,750 --> 03:16:18,100
before. 40. What is Carol's waist? I don't know. Girls have different.

1106
03:16:18,100 --> 03:16:24,780
It's different. Like a six, right? It's like zero to six.

1107
03:16:27,700 --> 03:16:40,870
Kim. Is Carol creative? Uh, sure. Is Carol domineering? I don't know what

1108
03:16:40,870 --> 03:16:45,909
that means. No. Is she discreet? Yes. Is she expressive? Yes. Are you

1109
03:16:45,909 --> 03:16:49,989
expressive? Yes. Is Carol intuitive? Yes. Are you talkative? Yes. Are you

1110
03:16:49,989 --> 03:16:56,790
easily aroused? Ah! No. Yes. No. Is Cal, I don't know. No. Is

1111
03:16:56,790 --> 03:17:00,790
Cal proud for breasts? Uh, yes. Are you...

1112
03:17:01,750 --> 03:17:05,739
All right. All right. That's the end of that one.

1113
03:17:18,409 --> 03:17:32,059
What the fuck does this mean? That's all I can handle at the moment. If

1114
03:17:32,059 --> 03:17:49,940
something comes up, ha ha, I'll be in touch. Ha ha. What does that mean? I

1115
03:17:49,940 --> 03:17:53,450
can't. Okay. I'm going to read this because I don't want it on the

1116
03:17:53,450 --> 03:17:56,059
screen because I'm going to replace words.

1117
03:17:56,299 --> 03:18:12,200
Uh, there's, there's no doubt about it. You are, uh, you're dominated

1118
03:18:12,200 --> 03:18:22,340
by a sense of want and lust. Uh, you, you, uh, as you pace the

1119
03:18:22,340 --> 03:18:31,430
streets of Hoboken. Hoboken? Sir, you deeply, almost, you're almost

1120
03:18:31,430 --> 03:18:36,629
unbearable horniness. I'm done. There's so much here that I can't

1121
03:18:36,629 --> 03:19:04,120
read. It's infidelity here. She has a husband. All right. Where

1122
03:19:04,120 --> 03:19:15,540
should we go? Carol asks. The circus. That doesn't sound quite

1123
03:19:15,540 --> 03:19:25,750
right to me, Dave. Where should we go? Uh, I think, I think we

1124
03:19:25,750 --> 03:19:35,500
should bed. I think we bar. Bar. That doesn't sound quite

1125
03:19:35,500 --> 03:19:44,200
right to me, Dave. Where should we go? Applebee's. That doesn't

1126
03:19:44,680 --> 03:19:56,200
sound right to me, Dave. Bed. Um, train.

1127
03:20:09,239 --> 03:20:13,239
Carol becomes bored by your inability to handle the situation

1128
03:20:13,239 --> 03:20:15,879
and leaves. You will never see her again, but sometimes she

1129
03:20:15,879 --> 03:20:19,850
sends a Christmas card. You really blew it, Dave. I said,

1130
03:20:19,850 --> 03:20:22,329
let's go to the bar. Let's go to the Applebee's. Let's go

1131
03:20:22,329 --> 03:20:26,069
to the club. Let's go to bed. What? How many more

1132
03:20:26,069 --> 03:20:56,549
things? What? Should I say bowling? I, wait, I can do it.

1133
03:20:56,549 --> 03:21:18,979
We don't go. Oh, she left. She left. Oh, but there was soft

1134
03:21:18,979 --> 03:21:21,770
porn too. You got it. It was a lot of fucked up shit. I

1135
03:21:21,770 --> 03:21:25,770
couldn't read. You got your, got it. There it is. There's

1136
03:21:25,770 --> 03:21:38,780
your made for TV version. Let us go back. Shall we? All

1137
03:21:38,780 --> 03:21:44,600
right. So that was here, right? Uh, that's correct,

1138
03:21:44,600 --> 03:21:50,219
right? We didn't move on from here. All right. Ladies and

1139
03:21:50,219 --> 03:21:54,299
gentlemen, if you could do me a favor and put your mouse

1140
03:21:54,299 --> 03:21:56,299
over the screen in a certain place. The red arrow

1141
03:21:56,299 --> 03:22:10,389
means you want to scroll down another page. Good luck.

1142
03:22:10,389 --> 03:22:19,659
Hmm. Interesting. Interesting selection. Uh, question for

1143
03:22:19,659 --> 03:22:22,620
the audience here. Do I have to play a full round of

1144
03:22:22,620 --> 03:22:31,739
Monopoly? Why would you want me to do that? Is that you

1145
03:22:31,739 --> 03:22:37,239
want me to? Okay, hold on. A third of you guys want me

1146
03:22:37,239 --> 03:22:42,440
to play a full round of Monopoly like a 25 year old

1147
03:22:42,440 --> 03:22:51,129
version by myself versus the computer. That can't be

1148
03:22:51,129 --> 03:22:55,989
right. I just, that can't be right. I don't think that

1149
03:22:55,989 --> 03:23:04,180
can't, that can't be right. That is correct. Yes.

1150
03:23:04,180 --> 03:23:11,610
Democracy sucks. What do you, what do you mean

1151
03:23:11,610 --> 03:23:15,620
straw poll? There's a interactable straw poll on the

1152
03:23:15,620 --> 03:23:24,739
screen right now. Straw, I just did it. Okay, do a

1153
03:23:24,739 --> 03:23:37,940
straw poll. The people have spoken, guys. I could

1154
03:23:37,940 --> 03:23:52,360
veto it, but I'm toying with the idea. I don't

1155
03:23:52,360 --> 03:23:56,569
understand chat sometimes. I don't understand this

1156
03:23:56,569 --> 03:23:58,809
chat sometimes. No one would actually stay and

1157
03:23:58,809 --> 03:24:01,290
continue talking if a full thing of Monopoly was

1158
03:24:01,290 --> 03:24:06,090
played. You'll get up and leave. You'll get up and

1159
03:24:06,090 --> 03:24:09,129
leave it on in the background, which means you

1160
03:24:09,129 --> 03:24:11,049
aren't fucking watching. If you're here to watch

1161
03:24:11,049 --> 03:24:15,610
someone play a game, pick a game, sit down, shut up

1162
03:24:15,610 --> 03:24:25,780
and watch him play. 65% don't want Monopoly. Yeah,

1163
03:24:25,780 --> 03:24:27,620
but look at all the other, look at, you're evenly

1164
03:24:27,620 --> 03:24:30,579
spread out a bunch of other games. How about this? I

1165
03:24:30,579 --> 03:24:33,700
will at least get, I'll at least go to jail in

1166
03:24:33,700 --> 03:24:35,299
Monopoly. You know what I mean? And we'll get that.

1167
03:24:35,299 --> 03:24:39,780
Don't you be coming back here now. It has

1168
03:24:39,780 --> 03:25:00,920
commenced. Monopoly. Okay. If I gave 15 minutes to

1169
03:25:00,920 --> 03:25:03,639
SimAnt, I will give 10 to Monopoly. There's

1170
03:25:03,639 --> 03:25:05,319
going to be like a five round Monopoly. They

1171
03:25:05,319 --> 03:25:10,170
always do it like this. Watch. I can pick the

1172
03:25:10,170 --> 03:25:12,170
amount of rounds, right? Well, this isn't Mario

1173
03:25:12,170 --> 03:25:17,829
Party. What? This one always works. All right,

1174
03:25:17,829 --> 03:25:26,090
let's go. How do I play? Monopoly. Go. New

1175
03:25:26,090 --> 03:25:31,510
game. All right. Player setup. I'm going to be

1176
03:25:31,510 --> 03:25:38,840
the guy in the green car. This is a human. XT

1177
03:25:38,840 --> 03:25:42,680
clone. 386 30. Okay. Why? Why can I play

1178
03:25:42,680 --> 03:25:46,600
against a microwave? Human, a calculator, a

1179
03:25:46,600 --> 03:25:59,659
computer or a microwave? Okay. Take 500. This

1180
03:25:59,659 --> 03:26:01,819
is going to be the calculator. Give. What

1181
03:26:01,819 --> 03:26:08,139
does this mean? Take five. What does this

1182
03:26:08,139 --> 03:26:13,959
mean? Zoom out. Oh, fuck. What does this

1183
03:26:14,040 --> 03:26:25,450
take 500? Give dice. I don't remember this

1184
03:26:25,450 --> 03:26:29,020
being part of the rules. Do I just drag

1185
03:26:29,020 --> 03:26:48,709
him out? Give. I'm human. Player setup. How

1186
03:26:48,709 --> 03:26:56,440
do I add the player? Zoom back in. No.

1187
03:26:56,440 --> 03:27:00,629
What? This is, what do you mean this is

1188
03:27:00,629 --> 03:27:01,989
too advanced? Does anybody else figure

1189
03:27:01,989 --> 03:27:04,889
this out? What's it? Whoa, what's doing?

1190
03:27:04,889 --> 03:27:10,040
He's coming out of the fucking ground.

1191
03:27:10,040 --> 03:27:13,000
What? Why is it the ghost Monopoly man?

1192
03:27:13,000 --> 03:27:15,239
How do I do that? I just want to add

1193
03:27:15,239 --> 03:27:37,799
the player. No sound. You rolled and now

1194
03:27:37,799 --> 03:27:54,389
you can move. Three. What? Anybody know

1195
03:27:54,389 --> 03:28:04,250
what's going on? Why do I get to roll

1196
03:28:04,250 --> 03:28:29,799
again? Four. The distinctive design of the

1197
03:28:29,799 --> 03:28:31,000
game board is whether it's each of the

1198
03:28:31,000 --> 03:28:32,280
distinctive pieces and elements of the

1199
03:28:32,280 --> 03:28:33,399
board. The pieces in the board

1200
03:28:33,399 --> 03:28:34,840
Monopoly are trademarks of Parker

1201
03:28:34,840 --> 03:28:36,200
Brothers Division of Tonka Corporation

1202
03:28:36,200 --> 03:28:37,479
for its real estate trading game and

1203
03:28:37,479 --> 03:28:46,870
the game equipment. I don't want to see

1204
03:28:46,870 --> 03:28:48,229
any more. All right. Now we just have

1205
03:28:48,229 --> 03:28:49,590
the credits just popping up on the

1206
03:28:49,590 --> 03:28:56,139
screen forever. Now what? Wait. I think

1207
03:28:56,139 --> 03:28:58,840
it is out of them. Human? Just make

1208
03:28:58,840 --> 03:29:00,840
them all. Who cares? We're going to

1209
03:29:00,840 --> 03:29:03,129
bet. I got it. I know what I'm doing.

1210
03:29:03,129 --> 03:29:04,329
I got it. I know it. Are we ready?

1211
03:29:04,329 --> 03:29:08,760
Watch this.

1212
03:29:08,760 --> 03:29:10,120
They're all going to be calculators.

1213
03:29:10,120 --> 03:29:14,090
Start. Got it. I got it. And we're going

1214
03:29:14,090 --> 03:29:15,530
to put a hat on.

1215
03:29:15,530 --> 03:29:17,290
And we're going to do a dog. They're

1216
03:29:17,290 --> 03:29:18,809
all going to. Okay. Bet. How many

1217
03:29:18,809 --> 03:29:19,850
people can you play? How many people can

1218
03:29:19,850 --> 03:29:22,860
play Monopoly?

1219
03:29:22,860 --> 03:29:24,780
You can't have fucking 10 people play

1220
03:29:24,780 --> 03:30:04,250
Monopoly. Why does he keep waking up

1221
03:30:04,250 --> 03:30:05,049
out of bed?

1222
03:30:05,049 --> 03:30:08,020
Hold on. Is there speed? It's got to

1223
03:30:08,020 --> 03:30:18,819
be speed, right?

1224
03:30:18,819 --> 03:30:50,780
Fast computers. Let's go. I can't even

1225
03:30:50,780 --> 03:30:53,020
do a one-minute game.

1226
03:30:53,020 --> 03:30:54,860
Well, how did I just add? I just

1227
03:30:54,860 --> 03:30:56,459
added players in the middle of

1228
03:30:56,459 --> 03:31:00,020
Monopoly and made it a one-minute game.

1229
03:31:00,020 --> 03:31:11,180
You can't do that. There we go. All

1230
03:31:11,180 --> 03:31:13,750
right. One minute. Who wins? There's like

1231
03:31:13,750 --> 03:31:20,889
30 pieces on the board. It's just like

1232
03:31:20,889 --> 03:31:25,989
you have the whole family come over.

1233
03:31:25,989 --> 03:31:28,309
Everybody gets to play. This fucking

1234
03:31:28,309 --> 03:31:29,909
30 pieces on the board.

1235
03:31:29,909 --> 03:31:37,750
It's like a D&D campaign. The game's

1236
03:31:37,750 --> 03:31:38,790
limit has been reached. The player with

1237
03:31:38,790 --> 03:31:40,149
the highest total assets wins the

1238
03:31:40,149 --> 03:31:41,899
game. Who won?

1239
03:31:41,899 --> 03:31:44,780
Congratulations, dog. You have the

1240
03:31:44,780 --> 03:31:47,350
most assets.

1241
03:31:47,350 --> 03:31:48,950
It just picked a random person that

1242
03:31:48,950 --> 03:31:52,329
didn't get to roll.

1243
03:31:52,329 --> 03:31:57,139
Dog takes victory lap. Good job, dog.

1244
03:31:57,139 --> 03:32:20,010
Well, this was terrible. Please vote

1245
03:32:20,010 --> 03:32:27,639
again. Vilemi.

1246
03:32:27,639 --> 03:32:30,780
50 more dollars from Vilemi. Oh, fuck.

1247
03:32:30,780 --> 03:32:34,219
Hold on. Stop.

1248
03:32:34,219 --> 03:32:38,059
Uh, ignore these Philistines. Play Jazz

1249
03:32:38,059 --> 03:32:40,760
Jackrabbit. That's not up to me. If it

1250
03:32:40,760 --> 03:32:42,680
were up to me, I would have played

1251
03:32:42,680 --> 03:32:45,559
uh, soft porn 2 for the next 12 hours.

1252
03:32:45,559 --> 03:32:59,620
It's not up to me. Holy shit. Really?

1253
03:32:59,620 --> 03:33:10,090
You're enabling them.

1254
03:33:10,090 --> 03:33:18,219
Lost to a calculator. Uh-oh. The Jazz

1255
03:33:18,219 --> 03:33:22,299
Jackrabbit votes are getting divided.

1256
03:33:22,299 --> 03:33:24,700
Jazz Jackrabbit and Jazz Jackrabbit

1257
03:33:24,700 --> 03:33:28,500
holiday hair in 1995.

1258
03:33:28,500 --> 03:33:34,379
So, um, you guys, you gotta come to a

1259
03:33:34,379 --> 03:33:35,739
consensus here.

1260
03:33:35,739 --> 03:33:40,219
So that's 20, that's 19, 29, 30,

1261
03:33:40,219 --> 03:33:42,219
that's 12, like 40 percent want a

1262
03:33:42,219 --> 03:33:57,559
version of Jazz Jackrabbit.

1263
03:33:57,559 --> 03:34:01,239
You guys, just, you got, why do half of

1264
03:34:01,239 --> 03:34:02,760
you want to see?

1265
03:34:02,760 --> 03:34:12,440
Uh, you guys gotta work together.

1266
03:34:12,440 --> 03:34:22,760
You split the vote.

1267
03:34:31,209 --> 03:34:33,610
We're scrolling. I'm sorry, guys, that's

1268
03:34:33,610 --> 03:34:34,489
not,

1269
03:34:34,489 --> 03:34:43,049
that's not how it works. So here's what

1270
03:34:43,049 --> 03:34:44,659
we're going to do.

1271
03:34:44,659 --> 03:34:46,420
Before I turn the stream off, we're

1272
03:34:46,420 --> 03:34:47,620
going to come back and do a final

1273
03:34:47,620 --> 03:34:49,700
vote on Jazz Jackrabbit, uh, or

1274
03:34:49,700 --> 03:34:52,500
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jackrabbit holiday

1275
03:34:52,500 --> 03:34:53,700
hair in 1995.

1276
03:34:53,700 --> 03:34:59,989
We'll do it before we leave. But, uh,

1277
03:34:59,989 --> 03:35:01,510
it's, whatever has the highest score

1278
03:35:01,510 --> 03:35:03,420
and people want to scroll.

1279
03:35:03,420 --> 03:35:04,780
You should have, um, had the

1280
03:35:04,780 --> 03:35:06,059
consensus there, but it's okay. You'll

1281
03:35:06,059 --> 03:35:07,180
have a chance again

1282
03:35:07,180 --> 03:35:14,760
in a little bit. Here we go.

1283
03:35:14,760 --> 03:35:19,020
Split the vote. All right,

1284
03:35:19,020 --> 03:35:25,639
here we are. I think we, uh, yeah, we're

1285
03:35:25,639 --> 03:35:30,979
in the right spot.

1286
03:35:30,979 --> 03:35:44,260
See ya in a second. Please choose. I've

1287
03:35:44,260 --> 03:35:44,819
got

1288
03:35:44,819 --> 03:35:46,899
some votes on Tetris. We have most

1289
03:35:46,899 --> 03:35:47,860
votes on

1290
03:35:47,860 --> 03:35:54,579
Cool World. We also have Mario's Game

1291
03:35:54,579 --> 03:35:56,180
Gallery,

1292
03:35:56,180 --> 03:36:07,530
and we have Ski or Die. Y'all are

1293
03:36:07,530 --> 03:36:13,670
thirsty.

1294
03:36:13,670 --> 03:36:36,979
I can't understand the chat sometimes.

1295
03:36:36,979 --> 03:36:38,340
All right, it looks like we're going to

1296
03:36:38,340 --> 03:36:40,100
be going with Cool World.

1297
03:36:40,100 --> 03:36:49,049
Thank you for voting. A lot of you want

1298
03:36:49,049 --> 03:36:50,010
Cool World.

1299
03:36:50,010 --> 03:36:52,729
We're gonna just have it on in the

1300
03:36:52,729 --> 03:36:59,459
background while he plays.

1301
03:36:59,459 --> 03:37:02,440
All right, let's go. Cool World.

1302
03:37:02,440 --> 03:37:05,559
Wasn't this a movie?

1303
03:37:05,559 --> 03:37:07,079
This is a movie game, right? Is it a

1304
03:37:07,079 --> 03:37:15,420
licensed movie game?

1305
03:37:15,420 --> 03:37:17,579
Ooh, I think it might have crashed. No, not

1306
03:37:17,579 --> 03:37:26,649
quite.

1307
03:37:26,649 --> 03:37:29,559
Blood? Is it Cool World's, the game

1308
03:37:29,559 --> 03:37:31,159
with the, um,

1309
03:37:31,159 --> 03:37:33,479
with the spot, right? The like red dot

1310
03:37:33,479 --> 03:37:34,440
thing?

1311
03:37:34,440 --> 03:37:40,329
The red, is it like the glass, the red

1312
03:37:40,409 --> 03:37:48,680
sunglasses?

1313
03:37:48,680 --> 03:37:52,409
That's a cool spot. All right, what?

1314
03:37:52,409 --> 03:37:54,250
Stop it. Let me go.

1315
03:37:54,250 --> 03:38:00,700
All right, use key. Hold on. Wait, wait.

1316
03:38:00,700 --> 03:38:02,299
Redefine keys.

1317
03:38:02,299 --> 03:38:04,379
Press key for up. Press key for down.

1318
03:38:04,379 --> 03:38:05,819
Press key for left.

1319
03:38:05,819 --> 03:38:08,780
Right. Fire. We'll make it, um,

1320
03:38:08,780 --> 03:38:10,139
I don't know,

1321
03:38:10,139 --> 03:38:13,180
C. Or, uh, yeah, C.

1322
03:38:13,180 --> 03:38:16,299
Pause. Space. Map.

1323
03:38:16,299 --> 03:38:26,469
Uh, M. Here we go. It's Bart Simpson?

1324
03:38:26,469 --> 03:38:31,379
What the fuck? Boss, get over to Spark's

1325
03:38:31,379 --> 03:38:33,379
place as fast as you can. He's trying to

1326
03:38:33,379 --> 03:38:35,379
jump into the real world. You must stop

1327
03:38:35,379 --> 03:38:36,100
him.

1328
03:38:36,100 --> 03:38:45,239
That really is just Bart Simpson. Was

1329
03:38:45,239 --> 03:38:55,030
this, was Bart Simpson in the movie?

1330
03:38:55,030 --> 03:38:58,299
It's just, it's, it's doing oof. This

1331
03:38:58,299 --> 03:38:59,579
is where they got the oof sound

1332
03:38:59,579 --> 03:39:00,860
effect for him.

1333
03:39:00,860 --> 03:39:18,280
This movie was okay, I guess. I don't,

1334
03:39:18,280 --> 03:39:20,200
I don't, I didn't even see the movie.

1335
03:39:20,200 --> 03:39:29,260
And why, why am I dressed like this?

1336
03:39:29,260 --> 03:39:34,860
Has, okay, somebody check. Has anybody

1337
03:39:34,860 --> 03:39:36,540
speed ran this game?

1338
03:39:36,540 --> 03:39:39,819
You're not welcome here, Harris. Ain't

1339
03:39:39,819 --> 03:39:40,700
you got

1340
03:39:40,700 --> 03:39:42,379
some better things to do with your

1341
03:39:42,379 --> 03:39:43,819
time than harassing innocent

1342
03:39:43,819 --> 03:39:58,459
doodles? How am I not welcome?

1343
03:39:58,459 --> 03:40:00,780
He's trying to go to the real world.

1344
03:40:00,780 --> 03:40:01,979
How do I stop him from going to the

1345
03:40:01,979 --> 03:40:03,260
real world?

1346
03:40:03,260 --> 03:40:11,299
You're not welcome. What's with the,

1347
03:40:11,299 --> 03:40:15,450
why are there demon doors?

1348
03:40:15,450 --> 03:40:20,170
You guys got click faded.

1349
03:40:20,170 --> 03:40:22,010
Oh, there's a girl on there. She's

1350
03:40:22,010 --> 03:40:24,250
dancing. Get that one.

1351
03:40:24,250 --> 03:40:28,420
Oh, sorry. It's a side scrolling

1352
03:40:28,420 --> 03:40:39,209
Bart Simpson shooter. Do I need more

1353
03:40:39,209 --> 03:40:40,329
money?

1354
03:40:40,329 --> 03:40:47,340
Money? What about map?

1355
03:40:47,340 --> 03:41:02,360
All right, um, up? I can't go up?

1356
03:41:02,360 --> 03:41:08,059
How the fuck do I get out of here?

1357
03:41:08,059 --> 03:41:16,520
All right, how do you, I gotta go up

1358
03:41:16,520 --> 03:41:18,120
and to the left and

1359
03:41:18,120 --> 03:41:21,350
I can't go up? It looks like I can go

1360
03:41:21,350 --> 03:41:23,260
up from here.

1361
03:41:23,260 --> 03:41:29,639
I can't go this way. Can I go up

1362
03:41:29,639 --> 03:41:30,920
through here?

1363
03:41:30,920 --> 03:41:35,540
Okay, here we go. All right, now we're

1364
03:41:35,540 --> 03:41:38,090
just gonna go right.

1365
03:41:38,090 --> 03:41:43,049
This is the door. I don't like your

1366
03:41:43,049 --> 03:41:44,489
money, Harris, but you've got enough

1367
03:41:44,489 --> 03:41:50,920
of it. Step inside, sucker.

1368
03:41:50,920 --> 03:41:56,739
Um, this is just a Sonic the Hedgehog

1369
03:41:56,739 --> 03:41:57,860
level.

1370
03:41:57,860 --> 03:41:59,860
I remember I hated this level. This is

1371
03:41:59,860 --> 03:42:01,139
like the casino level. This level

1372
03:42:01,139 --> 03:42:02,020
sucked.

1373
03:42:02,020 --> 03:42:09,209
This is the one where you could

1374
03:42:09,209 --> 03:42:10,969
drown and it was really easy to die

1375
03:42:10,969 --> 03:42:12,329
in like five seconds.

1376
03:42:12,329 --> 03:42:20,780
It's a good level. No, no. Wait, am I

1377
03:42:20,780 --> 03:42:21,979
thinking the right one?

1378
03:42:21,979 --> 03:42:23,659
Is that the one where you, it's

1379
03:42:23,659 --> 03:42:31,639
really easy to get trapped and die?

1380
03:42:31,639 --> 03:42:34,979
Real world comic books. No, I'm

1381
03:42:34,979 --> 03:42:36,020
thinking the wrong one. Oh, no, that's

1382
03:42:36,020 --> 03:42:38,979
chemical plant. Oh, that level sucks.

1383
03:42:38,979 --> 03:42:42,489
Can I make it?

1384
03:42:44,659 --> 03:42:46,180
I think, you know, the casino level was

1385
03:42:46,180 --> 03:42:54,540
awesome. I have no idea what the fuck's

1386
03:42:54,540 --> 03:42:55,180
going on.

1387
03:42:55,180 --> 03:42:59,459
I can't open the map anymore? Danger.

1388
03:42:59,459 --> 03:43:04,780
Danger.

1389
03:43:04,780 --> 03:43:07,180
Invalence is too great.

1390
03:43:07,180 --> 03:43:30,309
Did you do me a favor and click on the

1391
03:43:30,309 --> 03:43:31,430
screen where you'd like to see us go

1392
03:43:31,430 --> 03:43:37,209
next?

1393
03:43:37,209 --> 03:43:38,649
Wait, wait, I just influenced it. I

1394
03:43:38,649 --> 03:43:40,409
just, I just, I just, I just, people

1395
03:43:40,409 --> 03:43:41,530
are gonna click on that now. Hold on.

1396
03:43:41,530 --> 03:43:42,489
Wait, I just influenced it

1397
03:43:42,489 --> 03:43:46,899
accidentally.

1398
03:43:46,899 --> 03:44:05,260
Three, two, click girl.

1399
03:44:05,260 --> 03:44:12,469
Ten percent of you guys click girl. I

1400
03:44:12,469 --> 03:44:16,200
see girl.

1401
03:44:16,200 --> 03:44:18,920
Uh, Mario's game gallery looks like it's

1402
03:44:18,920 --> 03:44:19,799
gonna be the one.

1403
03:44:19,799 --> 03:44:33,290
This might be an illegal stream. Yeah,

1404
03:44:33,290 --> 03:44:34,569
that's gonna be it.

1405
03:44:34,569 --> 03:44:42,979
Uh, Mario's game gallery. Okay, let's

1406
03:44:42,979 --> 03:44:50,950
go.

1407
03:44:50,950 --> 03:44:58,729
Ugh. Interplay. What? What do you mean

1408
03:44:58,729 --> 03:44:59,850
interplay?

1409
03:44:59,850 --> 03:45:02,489
Interplay. What? This is blowing my

1410
03:45:02,489 --> 03:45:03,129
mind.

1411
03:45:03,129 --> 03:45:06,489
Along with presage, proudly present.

1412
03:45:06,489 --> 03:45:14,360
This is not real. Is this real? Use a

1413
03:45:14,360 --> 03:45:16,200
game gallery.

1414
03:45:16,200 --> 03:45:23,959
Wow. A nice game of

1415
03:45:24,040 --> 03:45:28,139
checkers. He's talking. Hold on, get this

1416
03:45:28,139 --> 03:45:29,340
off the screen.

1417
03:45:29,340 --> 03:45:31,639
This motherfucker is doing false

1418
03:45:31,639 --> 03:45:44,059
sentences. He's never done that before.

1419
03:45:44,059 --> 03:45:50,149
Matt Gaiman. What does he yacht?

1420
03:45:50,149 --> 03:45:52,950
Mario versus checkers. That's a great

1421
03:45:52,950 --> 03:45:56,459
game.

1422
03:45:56,459 --> 03:45:59,700
Wow, this is awesome. This is worth

1423
03:45:59,700 --> 03:46:01,299
going to jail for.

1424
03:46:01,299 --> 03:46:07,979
Nice to see you again. Do you want

1425
03:46:07,979 --> 03:46:08,459
to play

1426
03:46:08,459 --> 03:46:11,579
as Yoshi or as Koopa? I would like to

1427
03:46:11,579 --> 03:46:26,739
play as

1428
03:46:26,739 --> 03:46:30,899
I'll play as Yoshi. Yoshi, Yoshi.

1429
03:46:30,899 --> 03:46:36,090
The chosen one. It's your turn.

1430
03:46:36,090 --> 03:46:43,190
This is weird perspective. I don't think

1431
03:46:43,190 --> 03:46:44,149
you can do that.

1432
03:46:44,149 --> 03:46:45,989
What? No, that's, the mouse is like

1433
03:46:45,989 --> 03:46:48,010
laggy.

1434
03:46:48,010 --> 03:46:58,389
That's what Yoshi's ass looks like?

1435
03:46:58,389 --> 03:47:00,950
Move. That's not a legal move.

1436
03:47:00,950 --> 03:47:03,350
This is not a legal stream, Mario. Why

1437
03:47:03,350 --> 03:47:07,020
can I not do anything?

1438
03:47:07,020 --> 03:47:17,260
I could. You next. Set him up for this

1439
03:47:17,260 --> 03:47:18,780
one.

1440
03:47:19,670 --> 03:47:23,500
Set him up for this one. Oh, fuck. Yoshi's

1441
03:47:23,500 --> 03:47:27,100
dead.

1442
03:47:27,100 --> 03:47:28,860
Oh, you're so good. You got Mario

1443
03:47:28,860 --> 03:47:31,959
confused.

1444
03:47:31,959 --> 03:47:40,659
Eat him alive. Kill him. Let me think.

1445
03:47:40,659 --> 03:47:42,340
Don't ever move the back row. What

1446
03:47:42,340 --> 03:47:43,299
happens if you get king? Do you get

1447
03:47:43,299 --> 03:47:48,889
two Yoshis?

1448
03:47:48,889 --> 03:47:53,579
Hmm, all right. Okay. Hmm,

1449
03:47:53,579 --> 03:48:03,209
no, no, no, no, no, no. It's Mario's

1450
03:48:03,209 --> 03:48:03,850
move.

1451
03:48:03,850 --> 03:48:11,860
I'm setting you up for this one.

1452
03:48:11,860 --> 03:48:13,780
All right, now check this out. He

1453
03:48:13,780 --> 03:48:15,459
thinks he's one.

1454
03:48:15,459 --> 03:48:18,659
His brain is not even remotely as

1455
03:48:18,659 --> 03:48:23,450
mutated as mine. I've already seen his

1456
03:48:23,450 --> 03:48:25,290
next five plays.

1457
03:48:25,290 --> 03:48:32,389
Mama mia. I'm a no.

1458
03:48:32,389 --> 03:48:36,940
Okie dokie. Your move. I'm just setting it

1459
03:48:36,940 --> 03:48:39,159
up.

1460
03:48:39,159 --> 03:48:43,979
Mama mia. How about this?

1461
03:48:43,979 --> 03:48:46,700
Okay. It's your turn. That's third moves

1462
03:48:46,700 --> 03:48:47,420
in.

1463
03:48:47,420 --> 03:48:52,069
Three moves in. You must make a jump

1464
03:48:52,069 --> 03:48:53,799
now.

1465
03:48:53,799 --> 03:49:00,680
I don't. What are you talking about? Oh, yeah.

1466
03:49:00,680 --> 03:49:03,159
We're gonna play by those rules? Oh,

1467
03:49:03,159 --> 03:49:09,049
playing by shitty rules, huh?

1468
03:49:09,049 --> 03:49:10,889
You have to jump? I hate those rules.

1469
03:49:10,889 --> 03:49:13,049
That's for low brain.

1470
03:49:13,049 --> 03:49:33,850
Low IQ brains. Go ahead. Go over there and get

1471
03:49:33,850 --> 03:49:37,340
kinged.

1472
03:49:37,340 --> 03:49:44,920
You can't win against Mario. Like

1473
03:49:44,920 --> 03:49:46,120
Mario's dumb?

1474
03:49:46,120 --> 03:49:51,299
Mario, Mario has like 180 IQ.

1475
03:49:51,299 --> 03:50:14,819
He's very smart. Yeah, come on.

1476
03:50:14,819 --> 03:50:17,559
What? What? Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1477
03:50:18,520 --> 03:50:21,239
Hey Mario, as you say in your patented

1478
03:50:21,239 --> 03:50:22,760
licensed video game.

1479
03:50:22,760 --> 03:50:29,079
Okie dokie. You got the jump you can make.

1480
03:50:29,079 --> 03:50:49,159
Do it. Mama mia. See you later.

1481
03:50:49,159 --> 03:50:51,579
I'm not gonna move this guy ever. Or

1482
03:50:51,579 --> 03:50:52,299
this guy.

1483
03:50:52,299 --> 03:51:13,850
Good luck. I'm a no. This...

1484
03:51:13,850 --> 03:51:16,889
That's... I don't like that. That's

1485
03:51:16,889 --> 03:51:17,930
terrifying.

1486
03:51:17,930 --> 03:51:21,799
He's gonna have to come out sooner or

1487
03:51:21,799 --> 03:51:27,270
later. I got it.

1488
03:51:27,270 --> 03:51:29,829
It's your turn.

1489
03:51:29,829 --> 03:51:33,430
Ooh, Mario, Mario, Mario. What have you

1490
03:51:33,430 --> 03:51:35,049
done?

1491
03:51:35,049 --> 03:51:50,010
What have you done? It's my turn now.

1492
03:51:50,010 --> 03:52:14,139
Let me think. Mama mia.

1493
03:52:14,139 --> 03:52:30,379
Congrats. It's my turn now. Level up.

1494
03:52:30,379 --> 03:52:31,979
Wait, we could have done... We could

1495
03:52:31,979 --> 03:52:33,819
have had it free.

1496
03:52:33,819 --> 03:52:35,979
I'm just like clicking random

1497
03:52:35,979 --> 03:52:39,000
squares. I'm gonna be real.

1498
03:52:39,000 --> 03:52:41,079
But it's all right. I got a

1499
03:52:41,079 --> 03:52:53,750
Giga Yoshi. Your move. It's my turn now.

1500
03:52:53,750 --> 03:53:10,790
What's wrong with that Yoshi? I just

1501
03:53:10,790 --> 03:53:12,379
don't... I like...

1502
03:53:12,379 --> 03:53:13,899
I was making stupid moves in the

1503
03:53:13,899 --> 03:53:16,149
beginning for like laugh out loud

1504
03:53:16,149 --> 03:53:17,430
comedy moments and then I couldn't

1505
03:53:17,430 --> 03:53:19,030
salvage it so I just figured oh who

1506
03:53:19,030 --> 03:53:26,379
cares.

1507
03:53:26,379 --> 03:53:36,180
I can still win. Okie dokie. Crown me.

1508
03:53:36,180 --> 03:53:39,399
The good old... Wait, I turned into Bowser.

1509
03:53:39,399 --> 03:53:40,680
I want to see what Bowser could do

1510
03:53:40,680 --> 03:53:47,540
too.

1511
03:53:47,540 --> 03:53:49,299
I fucked her. I fucked off too much

1512
03:53:49,299 --> 03:53:50,579
in the first 10 minutes.

1513
03:53:50,579 --> 03:54:03,659
You can't go there. I can't go

1514
03:54:03,659 --> 03:54:07,260
backwards. I'm gonna lie just to lose.

1515
03:54:07,260 --> 03:54:11,639
Let me do it again. Hold on. I want to do it. I don't want to

1516
03:54:11,639 --> 03:54:12,920
fuck around this time though. Let me show

1517
03:54:12,920 --> 03:54:23,829
you that I'm not stupid.

1518
03:54:23,829 --> 03:54:27,510
Great. I'm a liar. Go fish?

1519
03:54:27,510 --> 03:54:29,190
I'm gonna prove that I'm gonna play

1520
03:54:29,190 --> 03:54:30,790
Go fish. I'm not gonna... I'm gonna win

1521
03:54:30,790 --> 03:54:31,510
this round.

1522
03:54:31,510 --> 03:54:36,520
Just wait. I'm so happy to see you

1523
03:54:36,520 --> 03:54:37,000
again.

1524
03:54:37,000 --> 03:54:38,360
Shut up and steal the cards

1525
03:54:38,360 --> 03:54:39,719
motherfucker.

1526
03:54:39,719 --> 03:54:45,899
We'll go first. Do you have any

1527
03:54:45,899 --> 03:54:47,500
reap than a fishy?

1528
03:54:47,500 --> 03:54:49,020
I don't even know what that one is.

1529
03:54:49,020 --> 03:54:51,899
Hey. Oh, right. I would like to have your

1530
03:54:51,899 --> 03:55:01,459
Bowser's. Mario, go fish.

1531
03:55:01,459 --> 03:55:04,260
It's supposed to be like a

1532
03:55:04,260 --> 03:55:11,799
five-year-old. Wait, what are the rules

1533
03:55:11,799 --> 03:55:13,239
for Go fish?

1534
03:55:13,239 --> 03:55:15,079
In Go fish, you and Mario will try to

1535
03:55:15,079 --> 03:55:15,959
have...

1536
03:55:15,959 --> 03:55:17,879
try to make as many books of four

1537
03:55:17,879 --> 03:55:19,000
of a kind as you can.

1538
03:55:19,000 --> 03:55:20,280
You are dealt... I don't remember how

1539
03:55:20,280 --> 03:55:21,719
to play Go fish. I haven't played it

1540
03:55:21,719 --> 03:55:23,319
in like 30 years.

1541
03:55:23,319 --> 03:55:25,079
You are dealt seven cards which

1542
03:55:25,079 --> 03:55:26,040
appear along the bottom of the

1543
03:55:26,040 --> 03:55:26,520
screen.

1544
03:55:26,520 --> 03:55:28,520
To ask Mario for a particular card, look

1545
03:55:28,520 --> 03:55:29,479
on a card.

1546
03:55:29,479 --> 03:55:34,090
Uh, I haven't played in a long time.

1547
03:55:34,090 --> 03:55:38,940
Go fish.

1548
03:55:38,940 --> 03:55:45,899
What? Please give me your reap than a

1549
03:55:45,899 --> 03:55:46,540
fishy.

1550
03:55:46,540 --> 03:55:47,739
I don't have any. I don't have any.

1551
03:55:47,739 --> 03:55:49,659
Mario, go fish.

1552
03:55:49,659 --> 03:55:54,459
Ah, I guess I'm gonna go fishing.

1553
03:55:54,459 --> 03:55:56,860
It's your turn.

1554
03:55:56,860 --> 03:55:59,340
All right. Do you have any Koopas?

1555
03:55:59,340 --> 03:56:01,100
Go fish. You have to...

1556
03:56:01,100 --> 03:56:02,780
What do you have for cards? Give me

1557
03:56:02,780 --> 03:56:04,459
a break.

1558
03:56:04,540 --> 03:56:08,489
A fishing for Luigi's.

1559
03:56:08,489 --> 03:56:11,610
Don't have any. Mario, go fish.

1560
03:56:11,610 --> 03:56:13,209
Looks like it's time to go fishing

1561
03:56:13,209 --> 03:56:15,909
again.

1562
03:56:15,909 --> 03:56:18,950
Okay. All right, you gotta have some

1563
03:56:18,950 --> 03:56:20,149
ba-bombs.

1564
03:56:20,149 --> 03:56:23,590
Yes, I'ma have two cards. Mario is

1565
03:56:23,590 --> 03:56:24,149
getting

1566
03:56:24,149 --> 03:56:27,829
destroyed. It's your turn. Hey Mario,

1567
03:56:27,829 --> 03:56:30,469
uh, you got any blue fucked up

1568
03:56:30,469 --> 03:56:30,950
Yoshi's?

1569
03:56:30,950 --> 03:56:40,170
Go fish. I'd like to have your

1570
03:56:40,170 --> 03:56:43,190
Koopas.

1571
03:56:43,270 --> 03:56:44,950
Sorry, tied up. Please give me your

1572
03:56:44,950 --> 03:56:46,950
Luigi's. Don't have any. He really

1573
03:56:46,950 --> 03:56:49,030
wants Luigi's. Mario, go fish.

1574
03:56:49,030 --> 03:56:52,709
Come here fishy fishy. Here fishy fishy.

1575
03:56:52,709 --> 03:56:55,670
It's your turn. Yeah, uh, I'd like

1576
03:56:55,670 --> 03:57:00,059
your rip van winkles please. Please, I'ma have two cards.

1577
03:57:00,059 --> 03:57:03,340
Thank you. Okay. All right,

1578
03:57:03,340 --> 03:57:06,299
so let's talk about how many toads

1579
03:57:06,299 --> 03:57:07,850
you got.

1580
03:57:07,850 --> 03:57:14,739
Go fish. Oh, I got two toads. You got what you wanted.

1581
03:57:14,819 --> 03:57:17,459
It's your turn. Mario, are you looking at my

1582
03:57:17,459 --> 03:57:21,190
cards?

1583
03:57:21,190 --> 03:57:24,379
So he's been cheating the whole time.

1584
03:57:24,379 --> 03:57:25,659
He's cheating in checkers too. He had

1585
03:57:25,659 --> 03:57:27,079
extra pieces.

1586
03:57:27,079 --> 03:57:30,440
Fine. Okay, that's fucked up. Go fish.

1587
03:57:30,440 --> 03:57:41,260
I'ma fishing for piranha plant.

1588
03:57:41,260 --> 03:57:43,899
The house always wins. I'ma looking for

1589
03:57:43,899 --> 03:57:45,819
Luigi's. He probably only needs one.

1590
03:57:45,819 --> 03:57:48,700
Give me your Luigi's.

1591
03:57:48,700 --> 03:57:52,440
I'ma guess I'ma go fishing. Mario has

1592
03:57:52,440 --> 03:57:53,559
this like fucked up

1593
03:57:53,559 --> 03:57:56,379
cheating casino. I think he has a game

1594
03:57:56,379 --> 03:57:58,059
promoted for two years.

1595
03:57:58,059 --> 03:58:00,549
His finance with illegal money. All

1596
03:58:00,549 --> 03:58:02,709
right, uh, he wants Yoshi's doesn't he?

1597
03:58:02,709 --> 03:58:05,590
Give me the Yoshi's. Yes, I have one card.

1598
03:58:05,590 --> 03:58:11,139
It's your turn. Okay, so

1599
03:58:11,139 --> 03:58:17,270
what about Goombas? Yes, sir. Yes, you

1600
03:58:17,270 --> 03:58:20,260
do. I have one card.

1601
03:58:20,260 --> 03:58:25,100
Hmm. Okay. I don't think I can do

1602
03:58:25,100 --> 03:58:26,620
anything else. Bob-ombs maybe? Maybe

1603
03:58:26,620 --> 03:58:28,200
he got another one.

1604
03:58:28,200 --> 03:58:37,100
Or a boo? Maybe he has a couple now.

1605
03:58:37,100 --> 03:58:41,100
Ooh. I'd like to have your Goombas.

1606
03:58:41,100 --> 03:58:44,790
Mario, go fish. Looks like it's time to go

1607
03:58:44,790 --> 03:58:45,909
fishing again.

1608
03:58:45,909 --> 03:58:48,389
All right, what'd you get? Mario gets to

1609
03:58:48,389 --> 03:58:49,350
go again.

1610
03:58:49,350 --> 03:58:52,069
Oh, fuck you, Mario. Do you have any

1611
03:58:52,069 --> 03:58:52,950
Luigi's?

1612
03:58:52,950 --> 03:58:55,829
No. Mario, go fish. No, he's gonna

1613
03:58:55,829 --> 03:58:57,590
he's gonna complete his deck.

1614
03:58:57,590 --> 03:59:00,229
Here, fishy. That's one book for Mario.

1615
03:59:00,229 --> 03:59:04,260
Oh, come on. What book was it? I don't know what to ask for.

1616
03:59:04,260 --> 03:59:07,540
Oh, you asshole. I'ma fishing for

1617
03:59:07,540 --> 03:59:12,260
piranha plant. Mario, go fish.

1618
03:59:12,260 --> 03:59:15,780
Come here, fishy fishy. Here, fishy fishy.

1619
03:59:15,780 --> 03:59:21,659
Okay. Can I play now? Do I get to go?

1620
03:59:21,659 --> 03:59:23,180
Do you? Yeah, I think you may have gotten

1621
03:59:23,180 --> 03:59:27,319
another sleepy. I could complete a book

1622
03:59:27,319 --> 03:59:29,319
here.

1623
03:59:29,319 --> 03:59:34,469
Go fish. I can get it though. No, he's

1624
03:59:34,469 --> 03:59:35,670
gonna ask for it.

1625
03:59:35,670 --> 03:59:41,180
Oh, rexes. I'm looking for

1626
03:59:41,180 --> 03:59:46,389
Bowser's. No, I don't want to go fish. Looks like it's time to go fishing again.

1627
03:59:46,389 --> 03:59:47,989
He's gonna complete the deck.

1628
03:59:47,989 --> 03:59:52,700
It's your turn. Come on, you get me. You had to have just got one.

1629
03:59:52,700 --> 03:59:58,459
Oh, brother. You got three of them, don't you?

1630
04:00:01,209 --> 04:00:10,520
So, one book for you. K. Check this out.

1631
04:00:10,520 --> 04:00:14,889
Yes, sir.

1632
04:00:14,889 --> 04:00:20,569
That's another book for you. It's your turn.

1633
04:00:20,569 --> 04:00:23,530
Hey Mario, you got any Yoshi's in there? Go fish.

1634
04:00:23,530 --> 04:00:28,649
Oh, I'll be getting one right now.

1635
04:00:28,649 --> 04:00:32,329
Oh, I would just start

1636
04:00:32,329 --> 04:00:36,729
punching the table. I'd like to have your

1637
04:00:36,729 --> 04:00:47,940
Piran. I guess I'm go fishing. Oh, you're so good.

1638
04:00:47,940 --> 04:00:51,780
Thank you. It's your turn. Oh, and guess what? Hey, the Yoshi you just took

1639
04:00:51,780 --> 04:00:56,760
out of the deck. I'll take it. Yes, sir. I have one card. Oh, would you like it?

1640
04:00:56,760 --> 04:00:59,799
I love it. I love seeing it. That's another book for you.

1641
04:00:59,799 --> 04:01:07,899
Mario think you fantastic. Okay.

1642
04:01:07,899 --> 04:01:13,620
Go fish. Mario, I don't think you beat me.

1643
04:01:13,620 --> 04:01:17,799
I'm fishing for... I get a Bowser's from here. I get

1644
04:01:17,799 --> 04:01:22,520
five books. Mario, go fish. Looks like it's time to go fishing again.

1645
04:01:22,520 --> 04:01:25,079
Mario's going easy on you because you're playing as a five-year-old. I really

1646
04:01:25,079 --> 04:01:29,079
enjoy playing with you. Oh, fuck. He really is. It's your turn.

1647
04:01:29,079 --> 04:01:32,200
He's complimenting me after every single

1648
04:01:32,200 --> 04:01:36,229
card he takes. He's saying really nice things about me. He's

1649
04:01:36,229 --> 04:01:46,700
letting me take his cards. Shit. Oh, no. I got three cards.

1650
04:01:46,700 --> 04:01:50,219
And I'm so excited about it. It's another book for you. Somebody would be mad about

1651
04:01:50,219 --> 04:01:55,180
this, but he's like, oh, no. We know. I love you. You're the

1652
04:01:55,180 --> 04:02:01,379
best. You're so smart at this game. Oh,

1653
04:02:01,379 --> 04:02:09,719
good. Yes, sir. I have one card. I'm cleaning

1654
04:02:09,719 --> 04:02:14,469
him out. I really enjoy playing with you.

1655
04:02:14,469 --> 04:02:23,959
It's your turn. Hey, you got any booze? Go fish.

1656
04:02:23,959 --> 04:02:27,319
Please give me your... He's not even trying anymore.

1657
04:02:27,319 --> 04:02:30,840
Mario, go fish. He's playing with an actual four-year-old.

1658
04:02:30,840 --> 04:02:34,600
I'm go fishing. You can't beat a four-year-old in any game.

1659
04:02:34,600 --> 04:02:37,639
I get another turn. You're a bad person if you do. I'm

1660
04:02:37,639 --> 04:02:42,280
looking for Bowser's. Anybody under the age of eight,

1661
04:02:42,360 --> 04:02:48,920
if you do any activity, you have to let them win.

1662
04:02:48,920 --> 04:02:53,610
Otherwise, you are a bad person. If you play,

1663
04:02:53,610 --> 04:02:57,290
let's say, for instance, like Connect Four

1664
04:02:57,290 --> 04:03:01,450
with a five-year-old, and you win, and you're like, yeah, I won.

1665
04:03:01,450 --> 04:03:05,370
Hold on, Mario.

1666
04:03:05,370 --> 04:03:16,520
Relax. Give me some time. Go fish. Somebody's three.

1667
04:03:16,600 --> 04:03:20,709
I'm looking for... Oh, shit. Big booze.

1668
04:03:20,709 --> 04:03:24,309
But now he's here. Do you have any rexes?

1669
04:03:24,309 --> 04:03:27,110
Mario, go fish. Mario, I got it.

1670
04:03:27,110 --> 04:03:32,649
I guess I'm go fishing. Mario, thank you.

1671
04:03:32,649 --> 04:03:37,579
Oh, okay. Thank you. Give me a coach.

1672
04:03:37,579 --> 04:03:43,899
Go fish. Okay. That's my favorite card. I love Mario.

1673
04:03:43,899 --> 04:03:47,180
I'm fishing for big booze. He just got them.

1674
04:03:47,180 --> 04:03:51,100
Mario, go fish. Come here, fishy, fishy.

1675
04:03:51,100 --> 04:03:54,379
Here, fishy, fishy. Oh, you're so good.

1676
04:03:54,379 --> 04:03:57,420
It's your turn. I really am getting played

1677
04:03:57,420 --> 04:04:02,379
as a four-year-old. I have one card.

1678
04:04:02,379 --> 04:04:06,219
I'm beating him by so much. It has to be intentional.

1679
04:04:06,219 --> 04:04:14,329
I really enjoy playing with you. It's your turn.

1680
04:04:14,329 --> 04:04:20,250
Go fish. That's so funny.

1681
04:04:20,329 --> 04:04:23,690
Where are you getting these cards? I'd like to have your rexes.

1682
04:04:23,690 --> 04:04:27,049
Mario, I haven't... I haven't had rexes in like

1683
04:04:27,049 --> 04:04:31,530
seven turns. Change the age in the options menu?

1684
04:04:31,530 --> 04:04:37,450
Fantastic. Shut up. That's not real.

1685
04:04:37,450 --> 04:04:40,649
I thought that just said change age for a second. I was like, there's no

1686
04:04:40,649 --> 04:04:48,229
fucking way. Change age.

1687
04:04:48,229 --> 04:04:58,010
Go fish. Please give me your booze.

1688
04:04:58,010 --> 04:05:03,479
Mario, go fish. Looks like it's time to go fishing again.

1689
04:05:03,479 --> 04:05:10,899
Oh, you're so good. It's your turn. Look at that. I thought you said

1690
04:05:10,899 --> 04:05:16,420
pretending gaze. Go fish. I should get a Goomba here. How many cards are in the deck?

1691
04:05:16,420 --> 04:05:25,670
I'd like to have your Mario's. Fine. Please give me your big booze.

1692
04:05:25,750 --> 04:05:34,280
Mario, go fish. Come here fishy fishy. Here fishy fishy. I really enjoy playing with you.

1693
04:05:34,280 --> 04:05:43,860
Okay. Um, this is actually the kind of scenario where like he's being held

1694
04:05:43,860 --> 04:05:47,700
hostage and he is trying to communicate with me somehow.

1695
04:05:47,700 --> 04:05:52,360
This is like the the type of shit. Look at him.

1696
04:05:52,360 --> 04:05:56,120
I'm really enjoying playing with you. Oh, you're so smart.

1697
04:05:56,120 --> 04:06:00,540
Okay, it's your turn. I really enjoy playing with you.

1698
04:06:00,540 --> 04:06:05,020
You're so good at this. Hey, I'm having a great time here

1699
04:06:05,020 --> 04:06:13,959
at the table. What's it take so long? Go fish.

1700
04:06:13,959 --> 04:06:21,959
Fishing for rexes. I'm a gaze. I'm a go fishing.

1701
04:06:21,959 --> 04:06:26,329
That stare too. They're like, I guess. That's another Mario.

1702
04:06:26,329 --> 04:06:34,649
Mario think you fantastic. Okay. He starts like winching his face and

1703
04:06:34,649 --> 04:06:40,250
like Mario think you fantastic. Wink over here under the table.

1704
04:06:40,250 --> 04:06:52,680
There's a gun pointing at me. Yes, I have two cards. That's another book for you.

1705
04:06:52,680 --> 04:07:01,370
Oh, you're so good. It's your turn. He's asking for Bowser's the whole time.

1706
04:07:01,370 --> 04:07:05,450
I got three cards. I know it's Bowser. I'm just beating him so bad.

1707
04:07:05,450 --> 04:07:12,389
That's another book for you. I really enjoy playing with you.

1708
04:07:12,469 --> 04:07:18,389
It's your turn. Go fish. Last card is going to be the goomba.

1709
04:07:18,389 --> 04:07:22,629
No, he's going to get the booze. I'm looking for big boos.

1710
04:07:22,629 --> 04:07:29,270
It's another book for Mario. No mercy.

1711
04:07:29,270 --> 04:07:33,430
Your rexes. He's going to get another book.

1712
04:07:33,430 --> 04:07:39,750
Sorry. Here fishy fishy. Here fish. It's another book for Mario.

1713
04:07:39,750 --> 04:07:43,739
I guess I need another card. What if he just keeps completing?

1714
04:07:43,739 --> 04:07:48,459
Fishing again. Is this where I get sharked? Do you have any goombas?

1715
04:07:48,459 --> 04:07:53,500
Oh no. Did I get sharked? No, I win. That's another book for Mario.

1716
04:07:53,500 --> 04:08:09,610
Hey, you won. Help me. I did it. Told you guys I was going to win.

1717
04:08:09,610 --> 04:08:18,219
Hey, how about another game with me? No, bye Mario.

1718
04:08:18,219 --> 04:08:24,200
What? And here's the thing. I don't know how to play

1719
04:08:24,200 --> 04:08:27,239
any of the rest of these games. I don't. I only know about

1720
04:08:27,239 --> 04:08:30,659
dominoes. You set them up for like six hours and you knock them down.

1721
04:08:30,659 --> 04:08:35,659
They do a cool thing. They spin around around your sofa and like over your

1722
04:08:35,659 --> 04:08:38,389
fridge and stuff. I don't know how to play this.

1723
04:08:38,389 --> 04:08:42,040
Like the actual game dominoes. I don't know.

1724
04:08:42,040 --> 04:08:46,360
Backgammon is, again, I have no idea.

1725
04:08:46,360 --> 04:08:49,879
And yacht is an expensive boat for rich people.

1726
04:08:49,879 --> 04:08:53,219
I don't know what that means. I'll try it. You guys have to help me here.

1727
04:08:53,219 --> 04:09:02,389
That is what this is. Okay. Mario, you are fucking enormous.

1728
04:09:02,389 --> 04:09:16,649
Why are you like 80 feet tall? He's huge. I'm gonna go first.

1729
04:09:16,649 --> 04:09:19,610
I don't know what this means. Oh, it's just, is it just like poker?

1730
04:09:19,610 --> 04:09:26,500
Like dice poker? You got a full house. That's going on the full house

1731
04:09:26,500 --> 04:09:34,100
line. Okey dokey. Your move. This is yacht. I've never played one game of

1732
04:09:34,100 --> 04:09:38,139
Yahtzee. All I know is I see people play

1733
04:09:38,139 --> 04:09:40,940
Yahtzee in TV and they don't just shake the thing around. They go

1734
04:09:40,940 --> 04:09:44,409
Yahtzee and they high five. I don't know what they're doing.

1735
04:09:44,409 --> 04:09:51,860
All right, so we need, uh, let's see. One, two, we could get a full house.

1736
04:09:51,860 --> 04:10:02,180
Choices, sixes. Hold on a minute here. What is going on?

1737
04:10:02,180 --> 04:10:07,959
Just re-roll, yeah, just re-roll the one, right? Because I could get a full

1738
04:10:07,959 --> 04:10:11,209
house. Does that mean I'm holding them? Does

1739
04:10:11,209 --> 04:10:22,860
that mean I'm rolling them? Click to hold. Okay, so roll.

1740
04:10:22,860 --> 04:10:49,299
Oh, I can try it again. Your turn. Hello. Oh wait, fours, choice?

1741
04:10:49,299 --> 04:10:58,520
Way to go. What is choice? It's my turn now.

1742
04:10:58,520 --> 04:11:02,360
Oh, you have to pick something, okay. I got it. The three threes,

1743
04:11:02,360 --> 04:11:06,520
come on. Yeah, Mario's got extra dice up his

1744
04:11:06,520 --> 04:11:19,270
uh, clubs. I'm gonna roll these ones again. He's gonna get five, okay.

1745
04:11:19,270 --> 04:11:23,510
Mario's gonna put these on the deuces line.

1746
04:11:23,510 --> 04:11:29,379
That's not that much. Your roll. The stream always devolves into some

1747
04:11:29,379 --> 04:11:34,309
form of gambling. We're not betting any money here. I'm playing

1748
04:11:34,549 --> 04:11:38,389
a children's dice game with a made-up kid's cartoon character. That was just

1749
04:11:38,389 --> 04:11:44,680
gambling. Mario's not real. All right, so we're

1750
04:11:44,680 --> 04:11:48,649
gonna go with the, I'm gonna try to get five of a kind.

1751
04:11:48,649 --> 04:11:52,090
Wait, can I do a straight? One, two, three, four. Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1752
04:11:52,090 --> 04:11:57,129
I could get a big straight, small straight. Let's go with one,

1753
04:11:57,129 --> 04:12:04,600
three, four. I just need two, right? I'm gonna roll for the two, because

1754
04:12:04,600 --> 04:12:06,680
that would be a small straight. What would, a big straight is the whole

1755
04:12:06,680 --> 04:12:16,200
thing. Yeah, fuck it, dude. No, let's go,

1756
04:12:16,200 --> 04:12:27,530
let's go for two. How is that a small straight? That's

1757
04:12:27,530 --> 04:12:36,389
one, oh shit. I just need five. One, two, three,

1758
04:12:36,389 --> 04:12:39,750
four, five. I still have the small straight.

1759
04:12:39,750 --> 04:13:00,870
It's all right, it's all right. This game's fun. I've never played it

1760
04:13:00,870 --> 04:13:04,069
before. This is cool. I like this. I'm gonna play this tomorrow.

1761
04:13:04,069 --> 04:13:13,750
I'm gonna roll these ones again. What do you mean, no, it's not.

1762
04:13:13,829 --> 04:13:18,709
Uh-oh. I'm gonna roll these ones again. So if you get a full house,

1763
04:13:18,709 --> 04:13:23,620
you can't do it again. Is the goal to get every single thing,

1764
04:13:23,620 --> 04:13:28,500
or just points? That's going on the aces line.

1765
04:13:28,500 --> 04:13:35,659
It's your turn. Oh, that's gonna go on the aces.

1766
04:13:35,659 --> 04:13:42,440
Yeah, at most points. I got, all right, bingo, we got two, we got one,

1767
04:13:42,440 --> 04:13:46,299
two, we got twos. Let's just try to get some twos here.

1768
04:13:46,299 --> 04:13:50,440
We could do one, two, three, four, five, six.

1769
04:13:50,440 --> 04:14:08,520
No, there it is. What do you mean, six is fives,

1770
04:14:08,520 --> 04:14:17,239
three is deuces? Sixes. It's only one six.

1771
04:14:17,239 --> 04:14:24,280
I don't... Oh no! It's my turn now. You just get six, you get six points.

1772
04:14:24,280 --> 04:14:29,000
Okay. Let's see. Well, I'm kicking the shit out of

1773
04:14:29,000 --> 04:14:41,780
him, so I'm all right. Fives. Don't get five. Don't get

1774
04:14:41,780 --> 04:14:47,110
any more. Yes. Mario's gonna put these on the

1775
04:14:47,110 --> 04:14:51,590
fives line. Stop hurting Mario. It's your turn.

1776
04:14:51,590 --> 04:15:00,180
I didn't do anything. That's pretty good. That's a pretty good chance for a full

1777
04:15:00,180 --> 04:15:04,700
house. I don't have it yet, so come on, give me

1778
04:15:04,700 --> 04:15:27,979
a five or a six. It's not a five or a six.

1779
04:15:27,979 --> 04:15:31,940
I wanted to get the five guy. The five...

1780
04:15:31,940 --> 04:15:41,260
Where is it? Aces. You want me to do aces?

1781
04:15:41,260 --> 04:15:45,579
No, no, no. Ones don't matter. Yes, yes, do it.

1782
04:15:45,579 --> 04:15:50,860
Minimize loss. Minimize loss. Aces max at six points.

1783
04:15:50,860 --> 04:15:56,700
Save fives. I don't... I don't... I don't... That's the first time I've ever

1784
04:15:56,700 --> 04:16:00,629
played this game. Just tell... Just help me.

1785
04:16:00,629 --> 04:16:11,190
Okay. It's such a simple card. I've never seen it before.

1786
04:16:11,190 --> 04:16:20,520
I know you make like cards like... Stop yelling at me.

1787
04:16:20,520 --> 04:16:24,040
Save bigger scoring categories. Yeah, that's... Yeah, that's true. I'm gonna win.

1788
04:16:24,040 --> 04:16:28,840
Don't worry. I got it. That's going on the little straight line.

1789
04:16:28,840 --> 04:16:36,090
Small straight. Okay, this is my chance. How do you get a... What's a yacht?

1790
04:16:36,090 --> 04:16:44,219
Yahtzee. Yahtzee. I get it now. All right. Here we go.

1791
04:16:44,219 --> 04:16:55,420
So the... It's five of a kind. Do I go for the full house here? That's not

1792
04:16:55,420 --> 04:17:00,149
going to be enough points though. That won't be a lot of points.

1793
04:17:00,149 --> 04:17:06,899
Does it... It depends on... Because it matters the denomination.

1794
04:17:06,899 --> 04:17:14,659
Yeah, that would be a waste. All right, there we go. Well, there's the full

1795
04:17:14,659 --> 04:17:18,809
house right there. God damn it. Should I just save the threes and

1796
04:17:18,809 --> 04:17:22,809
try to go for another... More threes? Or should I just keep this as a full

1797
04:17:22,809 --> 04:17:31,059
house? Because... Because what... That's not...

1798
04:17:31,059 --> 04:17:32,579
All right. I'm gonna take the full house.

1799
04:17:32,579 --> 04:17:39,940
That's a good move. It's my turn now.

1800
04:17:39,940 --> 04:17:43,059
That's a poor man's full house. Well, it might be the only one I get.

1801
04:17:43,059 --> 04:17:50,260
Is he going for sixes? Oh no, this is bad.

1802
04:17:50,260 --> 04:17:58,040
I'm gonna roll these ones again. Do not get a full six, Yahtzee.

1803
04:17:58,040 --> 04:18:04,819
Let's see. Mario's gonna put this on the sixes line.

1804
04:18:04,819 --> 04:18:08,340
How much money points? 18 points for three sixes.

1805
04:18:08,340 --> 04:18:21,979
Oh my god, okay. Okay, we can do fives. There's also one, two, three. One, two,

1806
04:18:21,979 --> 04:18:33,340
three, four, five. What's a big straight?

1807
04:18:33,340 --> 04:18:45,530
All of them? One, two, three, four, five.

1808
04:18:45,610 --> 04:19:16,520
Oh boy, come on. Give me a four. I could have had it.

1809
04:19:16,520 --> 04:19:25,750
It's not that hard. It's not a bad chance. He's going for the ones.

1810
04:19:25,750 --> 04:19:29,639
What? Oh no. I'm gonna roll these ones again.

1811
04:19:29,639 --> 04:19:35,350
He's going for a four or five of a kind. He really wants those big sixes.

1812
04:19:35,350 --> 04:19:38,469
Oh my god, game sucks. That's going on the

1813
04:19:38,469 --> 04:19:41,989
Yahtzee. How many points is that? 50.

1814
04:19:42,069 --> 04:19:46,500
Okie dokie. Your move. Oh, I'm never gonna win now.

1815
04:19:46,500 --> 04:19:48,979
That's like the, that's the best thing you could possibly get in the whole

1816
04:19:48,979 --> 04:20:01,989
game. There's no way I'm gonna win. It was all sixes. I just feel defeated

1817
04:20:01,989 --> 04:20:09,399
now. Lost to Mario. I just beat him though,

1818
04:20:09,399 --> 04:20:12,280
whatever. Um, I'm, I guess I could go for,

1819
04:20:12,280 --> 04:20:17,190
doesn't matter. It's just like being at the blackjack table and a guy

1820
04:20:17,190 --> 04:20:19,350
next to you does like a five hundred dollar hand and he gets

1821
04:20:19,350 --> 04:20:22,790
blackjack and you've lost the like the last five hands in a row and you

1822
04:20:22,790 --> 04:20:27,350
lose again and he's like yeah oh my god blackjack and you're sitting there like

1823
04:20:27,350 --> 04:20:37,219
fun games we're having here fun having a fun time

1824
04:20:37,219 --> 04:20:43,739

1825
04:20:43,739 --> 04:20:56,520
four five six give me a two well do i try to beat him in his own game and

1827
04:20:58,440 --> 04:21:16,729

three sorry mario's gonna put these on the aces line yeah he he doesn't have

1939
04:38:00,860 --> 04:38:03,900
very many opportunities for points he really has to get fours or threes i

1940
04:38:03,900 --> 04:38:09,610
can win this i just need a good sixes round i can win

1941
04:38:09,610 --> 04:38:14,090
and that's how you get it this is how it starts this is how i win

1942
04:38:14,090 --> 04:38:18,250
we are going straight up sixes and i need at least

1943
04:38:18,250 --> 04:38:28,200
four of them three or four of them it's not come on

1944
04:38:28,200 --> 04:38:42,340

1945
04:38:42,340 --> 04:38:48,819
this is a winnable game now it's my turn now

1946
04:38:48,819 --> 04:38:53,299
i got a real chance here he just has to get some bad rolls

1947
04:38:53,299 --> 04:38:57,639
no it's fine he already took his uh sixes all right just give him one

that's going on the fours line it's your turn it's gonna be close

1951
04:39:31,380 --> 04:39:35,459
five but i feel like i don't want to do the fives until i get

04:48:45,000 --> 04:48:57,590
just give up uh oh uh oh is right i'm gonna

2023
04:48:57,590 --> 04:49:07,639
roll these ones again uh oh this is bad

2024
04:49:07,639 --> 04:49:15,590
he's not gonna get it let's see mario's gonna put this

2025
04:49:15,590 --> 04:49:20,470
that's the second time he's done that your roll that's the second time he's

2026
04:49:20,470 --> 04:49:30,069
done that that's uh that gets hairy here all right

2027
04:49:30,069 --> 04:49:42,060

2032
04:50:17,240 --> 04:50:27,639
three is not terrible i could get four oh no he already fell he already did a

2033
04:50:27,639 --> 04:50:31,159
full house that's a pretty average score not bad

2034
04:50:31,159 --> 04:50:41,930
speaking of fall houses i wonder if this is worth getting or if i should

2035
04:50:41,930 --> 04:50:47,130
go for fives but i'm an idiot never mind i thought

2036
04:50:47,130 --> 04:50:56,520
that was a three come on i can't just get three in

2037
04:50:56,520 --> 04:51:14,459
every category another one yes oh thank you for playing my game

2038
04:51:14,459 --> 04:51:28,389
that's a that's a yahtzee it's my turn now

2039
04:51:28,389 --> 04:51:31,590
we're almost at the level of uh unachievable to win

2040
04:51:31,590 --> 04:51:34,310
unless he gets one if he gets a yahtzee the game still goes it's

2041
04:51:34,310 --> 04:51:39,700
still good it's still very possible my top three

2042
04:51:39,700 --> 04:51:46,459

the game oh your big straight is gonna really

2060
04:54:04,729 --> 04:54:29,939
help you here i think he's just depressed

2061
04:54:29,939 --> 04:54:32,979
i think he gave up i think he's just realizing that it's impossible for him

2062
04:54:32,979 --> 04:54:39,720
to win he took the loss all right well let's

2063
04:54:39,720 --> 04:54:46,970
go for um it's i mean the game's over one iq mario

2064
04:54:46,970 --> 04:54:52,060
look at that look at him if that look at that face he is so

2065
04:54:52,060 --> 04:54:57,590
fucking angry right now look at his lips just fucking pushed

2066
04:54:57,590 --> 04:55:02,729
crushed together just look at his hands his body language

2067
04:55:02,729 --> 04:55:11,560
clasping his hands together no no mario fine

2068
04:55:11,560 --> 04:55:15,000

2071
04:55:58,040 --> 04:56:01,000
win the game's over that's going on the straight

2072
04:56:01,000 --> 04:56:05,000
line it's not possible for him to win it's your turn

2073
04:56:05,000 --> 04:56:10,020
i mean i guess if i didn't get anything

2074
04:56:10,020 --> 04:56:13,459
it might be possible sort of something really bad would have to

2075
04:56:13,459 --> 04:56:22,360
happen uh we could go for four of kind

2512
06:06:38,810 --> 06:06:43,240
oregon trail the oregon trail if you put a the in front of it it becomes

2513
06:06:43,240 --> 06:06:46,360
oregon for me the oregon trail no it's the oregon

2514
06:06:46,360 --> 06:07:06,099

06:27:15,560 --> 06:27:26,139
i'm loving it oh why did i have to go out on that one

2638
06:27:26,139 --> 06:27:31,259
that shouldn't have been the one to go out on you could hear halfway

2639
06:27:31,259 --> 06:27:38,759
through my voice start to give out on that one you did you

2640
06:27:38,759 --> 06:27:40,360
know you know but sometimes you have to commit

2641
06:27:40,360 --> 06:27:43,319
even though you know it's like that's this is a stupid reference and no one's

2642
06:27:43,319 --> 06:27:50,139
gonna like this it was a nightmare tear joke oh no

2643
06:27:50,139 --> 06:27:54,069
oh no i better wake up i gotta wake up no

2644
06:27:54,069 --> 06:28:06,220
no not a nightmare tear but uh that's gonna be it i will see you guys

2645
06:28:06,220 --> 06:28:16,119
on what's today saturday i'll see you guys on tuesday

2646
06:28:16,119 --> 06:28:21,799
tuesday afternoon reno i'm gonna read the bits we'll hang out for a little

2647
06:28:21,799 --> 06:28:24,459
bit i'm just for the people that want to

2648
06:28:24,459 --> 06:28:35,560
take off but this was a little trial test run to see how fun something like

2649
06:28:35,560 --> 06:28:38,970
this would be and there's a lot to still play

2650
06:28:38,970 --> 06:28:42,490
i might change up the format a little bit i might pick a screen

2651
06:28:42,490 --> 06:28:48,900
and then we have to pick uh like two or three games from that

2652
06:28:48,900 --> 06:28:54,740
screen i think that's better that way the scroll can still be there but it

2653
06:28:54,740 --> 06:28:59,720
will pop up i mean maybe it'll just after we do three we'll just scroll

2654
06:28:59,720 --> 06:29:03,560
instead of rather than just because i feel like maybe

2655
06:29:03,560 --> 06:29:06,680
if you want it to scroll you may potentially throw in a vote away to pick

2656
06:29:06,680 --> 06:29:13,189
a game that was already on the screen so maybe per eat per screen we would do

2657
06:29:13,189 --> 06:29:19,159
three and then i would just scroll down

2658
06:29:19,159 --> 06:29:21,479
but you'll see this again we'll probably do it next week we'll do

2659
06:29:21,479 --> 06:29:24,119
some other stuff next week too thank you for joining me

2660

three dollars from mr comcast mr comcast you sure do like to give me a

2664
06:29:45,159 --> 06:29:49,240
lot of money how about three and then an option to

2665
06:29:49,240 --> 06:29:57,020

06:35:47,830 --> 06:35:51,540
interested in final fantasy 7 or the remake

2722
06:35:51,540 --> 06:35:55,619
the original one is good but it's not really i wouldn't put that in my

2723
06:35:55,619 --> 06:36:00,490
top five top 10 really it's not that i don't think the game is any good

2724
06:36:00,490 --> 06:36:02,490
it's just not kind of anything i really

2725
06:36:02,490 --> 06:36:07,220
cared that much about it's a great game but

2726
06:36:07,220 --> 06:36:10,979
uh final fantasy wise i played the old ones

2727
06:36:11,299 --> 06:36:16,759
fantasy one two three uh but for the most part i was a

2728
06:36:16,759 --> 06:36:21,159
i'm one of those chrono boomers i'm one of those like chrono

2729
06:36:21,159 --> 06:36:26,139
series and hipsters that loves that series more than final fantasy

2730
06:36:26,139 --> 06:36:29,419
and every time somebody mentions final fantasy x

2731
06:36:29,419 --> 06:36:33,189
final fantasy whatever it doesn't matter i'm always the one that goes

2732
06:36:33,189 --> 06:36:36,970
i just wish they would make another chrono god damn it i think it's one

2733
06:36:36,970 --> 06:36:45,180
of my favorite series ever i'm a chrono hipster it's not

2734
06:36:45,180 --> 06:36:49,939
chrono hipster it's chrono normie wouldn't final fantasy be the normie

2735
06:36:49,939 --> 06:36:53,560
and the and chrono trigger be the hipster

2736
06:36:53,560 --> 06:36:59,340
chrono trigger has two games final fancy has like

2737
06:36:59,340 --> 06:37:08,200
30 there are like 34 final fantasy games

2738
06:37:08,200 --> 06:37:13,909
chrono loser no chrono is not mainstream

2739
06:37:13,909 --> 06:37:17,349
just because they've re-released it 12 times doesn't mean everybody bought

2740
06:37:17,349 --> 06:37:31,750
it but uh yeah i final fantasy is a

2741
06:37:31,750 --> 06:37:34,549
cool series i like the original ones i'm not a big fan of the

2742
06:37:34,549 --> 06:37:39,590
later ones though just wasn't my thing i hope it's good i hope

2743
06:37:39,590 --> 06:37:50,459

2863
06:51:10,310 --> 06:51:24,020
sell all stocks quickly before they go to zero but i don't i don't

2864
06:51:24,020 --> 06:51:30,630
think so i don't want to keep putting the

2865
06:51:30,630 --> 06:51:34,470
carrot in front of everybody maybe next time maybe next time no no

2866
06:51:34,470 --> 06:51:42,439
i invested in germa and i'm down 3k did you invest in key wall like i told

2867
06:51:42,439 --> 06:51:44,119
you to remember i told you what did i say

2868
06:51:44,119 --> 06:51:47,639
specifically put all your money into key well i said that

2869
06:51:47,639 --> 06:51:52,279
that key will key well stock is up like fucking 500 i told you

2870
06:51:52,279 --> 06:52:06,860
you should have listened to me did you play the game yes i did

2871
06:52:06,860 --> 06:52:10,299
i did play the first ace attorney for maybe

2872
06:52:10,299 --> 06:52:16,950
15 20 minutes i'll tell you i'll tell you something that

2873
06:52:16,950 --> 06:52:21,349
i really don't i didn't i didn't like i don't know if you can turn this

2874
06:52:21,349 --> 06:52:27,560
off but the screen flash it seems like every

2875
06:52:27,560 --> 06:52:34,439
10 seconds there's a like a white flash on the screen

2876
06:52:34,439 --> 06:52:41,220
and i it was kind of giving me a headache i'm just i'm just being

2877
06:52:41,220 --> 06:52:48,259
completely honest during like the dialogue it's just

2878
06:52:48,259 --> 06:52:56,500
like white flash white flash white flash white flash

2879
06:52:56,500 --> 06:53:01,740
it's dramatic and it's kind of just getting flashed in the face

2880
06:53:01,740 --> 06:53:04,700
that's why no that's not why i just there's somebody asked if i

2881
06:53:04,700 --> 06:53:09,900
tried it and i did that's not why i wasn't going to

2882
06:53:09,900 --> 06:53:13,209
play it just was it seemed like it seemed like it was going to take a

2883
06:53:13,209 --> 06:53:15,930
long time to and it would go and almost solely

2884
06:53:15,930 --> 06:53:20,409
relied on the dialogue which i would have to read

2885
06:53:20,409 --> 06:53:24,250
and instead of something like sorcery which reading was

2886
06:53:24,250 --> 06:53:26,650
i could kind of put my own spin on it and we could choose different things to

2887
06:53:26,650 --> 06:53:38,919
do it it's more of just a kind of a visual novel

2888
06:53:38,919 --> 06:53:42,759
i would much rather play that comfy like under my blankets

2889
06:53:42,759 --> 06:53:46,919
with a t and just sit there silent and like investigate then

2890
06:53:46,919 --> 06:53:50,200
stream something like that is what i kind of came to the

2891
06:53:50,200 --> 06:54:07,529
determination of but yeah i i don't want to

2892
06:54:07,529 --> 06:54:13,209
you know obviously that i don't think it's a bad series that's no way

2893
06:54:13,209 --> 06:54:16,650
no way just don't think i want to stream that game

2894
06:54:16,650 --> 06:54:21,819
or the series i'm sorry i'm sorry do i play games without streaming them

2895
06:54:21,819 --> 06:54:26,520
yeah i actually just played forager for a little while

2896
06:54:26,520 --> 06:54:30,939
for like four or five hours over the last like couple weeks

2897
06:54:30,939 --> 06:54:34,939
it's fun i don't really you know talk that much about the random stuff

2898
06:54:34,939 --> 06:54:45,880
i play off stream he's cheating on us how do you

2899
06:54:45,880 --> 06:54:51,500
find the time to do it i uh it really depends like

2900
06:54:51,500 --> 06:54:55,419
sometimes well 90 of every game i play is on

2901
06:54:55,419 --> 06:55:01,860
stream but i only have a few hours sometimes

2902
06:55:01,860 --> 06:55:07,020
just jump into i actually restarted sakiro

2903
06:55:07,020 --> 06:55:09,979
not yesterday the day i mean like a couple then maybe like three or four

2904
06:55:09,979 --> 06:55:13,220
weeks ago i like restarted it and played it

2905
06:55:13,220 --> 06:55:17,060
like kind of casually off and on to do the other

2906
06:55:17,060 --> 06:55:23,700
stuff and i'm just still kind of letting it play out

2907
06:55:23,700 --> 06:55:27,060
does it feel weird to not talk while you play no not really

2908
06:55:27,060 --> 06:55:35,419
the game has no replayability well it doesn't have

2909
06:55:35,419 --> 06:55:39,220
in the traditional sense no but there's a

2910
06:55:39,220 --> 06:55:43,450
couple of endings that you there's like three or four bosses that i

2911
06:55:43,450 --> 06:55:49,369
didn't see so this content that i didn't get to

2912
06:55:49,369 --> 06:55:52,330
play and i would get to play it if i did

2913
06:55:52,330 --> 06:55:55,610
through go went through one more time right there's something like that has

2914
06:55:55,610 --> 06:55:57,689
like four or five different endings there's like

2915
06:55:57,689 --> 06:56:00,650
other content and bosses and stuff that you can get it with a different

2916
06:56:00,650 --> 06:56:05,849
stuff maybe from what i understand that is

2917
06:56:05,849 --> 06:56:08,729
replayability yeah but not in like the the dark souls kind of

2918
06:56:08,729 --> 06:56:12,169
replayability where there's the bosses are oh you can go and do

2919
06:56:12,169 --> 06:56:14,650
whatever you want but you can pick a different weapon and take a

2920
06:56:14,650 --> 06:56:17,529
different class and try a different spell and

2921
06:56:17,529 --> 06:56:24,540
you can replay through sakiro a few times maybe twice three times maybe if

2922
06:56:24,540 --> 06:56:29,500
you want to get all the endings and but the game stays

2923
06:56:29,500 --> 06:56:32,299
the same unless you know obviously i don't want to

2924
06:56:32,299 --> 06:56:35,340
keep i don't want to keep having i want spoilers to not be here

2925
06:56:35,340 --> 06:56:40,220
anyone that hasn't played it yet but there's like three or four what plus

2926
06:56:40,220 --> 06:56:52,099
endings right i've ever played enter the gungeon

2927
06:56:52,099 --> 06:56:59,369
yes i have depends on how much you like it whatever floats your boat

2928
06:56:59,369 --> 06:57:02,650
oh yeah if you like something and you do it and you want to play it

2929
06:57:02,650 --> 06:57:06,229
through more than three four five six ten times how

2930
06:57:06,229 --> 06:57:09,590
you know it's it's your time and it's your money right like if you buy

2931
06:57:09,590 --> 06:57:11,430
something and you want to spend the time doing it

2932
06:57:11,430 --> 06:57:24,119
absolutely is this the is this vod worth watching

2933
06:57:24,119 --> 06:57:28,919
absolutely yes all right bye sure is it vod worth watching

2934
06:57:28,919 --> 06:57:41,779
we got a question here hey hey hey what wait wait no you're memeing me here

2935
06:57:41,779 --> 06:57:44,020

06:57:44,020 --> 06:57:46,419
batman all right just skip the batman part

2937
06:57:46,419 --> 06:57:49,459
and then rewind and watch all the rest of it because it's good

2938
06:57:49,459 --> 06:58:07,750
i can't believe i i clicked a porn game i actually did that tonight

2939
06:58:07,750 --> 06:58:21,130
holy shit well it was text only and these are our imaginations and chat

2940
06:58:21,130 --> 06:58:26,250
really had to use their imaginations because they didn't get to see anything

2941
06:58:26,250 --> 06:58:29,450
no but all jokes aside i i loved it i had a lot of fun tonight

2942
06:58:29,450 --> 06:58:34,090
and we're gonna definitely do it again so yes go watch the bot don't

2943
06:58:34,090 --> 06:58:43,049
come on uh hey thank you too uh we got multi-trip earlier thanks to

2944
06:58:43,049 --> 06:58:45,130
the 10 bucks multi-trip i had a dream that you couldn't get any of

2945
06:58:45,130 --> 06:58:47,369
the dos games to work and got really frustrated

2946
06:58:47,450 --> 06:58:50,729
and streamed more to how instead that would have happened that's probably

2947
06:58:50,729 --> 06:58:55,049
exactly and now we probably just went to sam and max if this was a catastrophe

2948
06:58:55,049 --> 06:58:59,509
stream i would have just went right to episode three

2949
06:58:59,509 --> 06:59:05,080
in a second it would have taken one second but thank you the 10 dollars

2950
06:59:05,080 --> 06:59:09,000
thank you the jack for the 250 if you decide to give jazz jack

2951
06:59:09,000 --> 06:59:12,840
rabbit 2 a try there's a fan project called jazz

2952
06:59:12,840 --> 06:59:15,799
jack rabbit 2 plus that adds a bunch of fixes and

2953
06:59:15,799 --> 06:59:19,479
quality of life improvements including xbox controller support

2954
06:59:19,479 --> 06:59:30,200
to like a 25 year old game holy shit how do people even do this

2955
06:59:30,200 --> 06:59:35,909
some big brains out there i will definitely keep that in mind though

2956
06:59:35,909 --> 06:59:40,340
i guess we'll be doing this again i got sam and max in the back pocket

2957
06:59:40,340 --> 06:59:46,700
always but i'll keep that in mind thanks

2958
06:59:46,700 --> 06:59:51,819
to the 250 the jack uh freudian weapon thanks to the 250

2959
06:59:51,819 --> 06:59:53,740
i'll be honest i've never played chrono trigger

2960
06:59:53,740 --> 06:59:57,180
but i've had so many friends geek out about it that i feel inclined to

2961
06:59:57,180 --> 07:00:02,340
check it out sometime it is the best turn-based rpg that

2962
07:00:02,340 --> 07:00:13,459
has ever been made it's just it just is it was very well

2963
07:00:13,459 --> 07:00:19,990
before its time i think it's the best turn-based rpg

2964
07:00:19,990 --> 07:00:32,950
i i that's i don't that's just my opinion

2965
07:00:32,950 --> 07:00:36,889
here comes a back pedal no no back pedal

2966
07:00:36,889 --> 07:00:40,409
i think chrono trigger is the best rpg turn-based

2967
07:00:40,409 --> 07:00:44,330
remember we're not i'm not talking action rpg that's diablo 2

2968
07:00:44,330 --> 07:00:50,119
i'll do it for you turn-based rpg chrono trigger

2969
07:00:50,119 --> 07:00:58,520
uh action rpg diablo 2 what are the rpgs are there role playing rpg

2970
07:00:58,520 --> 07:01:07,430
no um what's another what's another one mmo rpg

2971
07:01:07,430 --> 07:01:11,930
oh that's a tough one i'd have to say world of warcraft

2972
07:01:11,930 --> 07:01:17,720
the frozen throne wrath of the lich king that's the best mmo rpg

2973
07:01:17,720 --> 07:01:38,490
what's the best fps rpg uh fps rpg fps rpg let me think about this

2974
07:01:39,060 --> 07:01:42,419
i mean they really only are a kind of a handful is like the fallout there's

2975
07:01:42,419 --> 07:01:47,049
like borderlands which i would not put borderlands even on that list

2976
07:01:47,049 --> 07:02:01,110
i don't think so um i don't think borderland i don't think borderlands

2977
07:02:01,110 --> 07:02:05,509
is like a top like two or three i i wouldn't

2978
07:02:05,509 --> 07:02:08,009
put borderlands in the top three for me

2979
07:02:08,009 --> 07:02:11,930
for first person shooter rpgs i put new vegas would be there

2980
07:02:11,930 --> 07:02:16,919
but new vegas is also not you can do that in third person

2981
07:02:16,919 --> 07:02:23,799
um might and magic dark messiah yeah that's number one

2982
07:02:23,799 --> 07:02:34,090
bioshock is yeah that's not really an rpg cyberpunk

2983
07:02:34,090 --> 07:02:41,159
well when cyberpunk comes out i think all bets are off borderlands

2984
07:02:41,159 --> 07:02:44,520
borderlands 1 was cool borderlands 2 was all right it just they kind of did

2985
07:02:44,520 --> 07:02:48,900
the same game three times they did that like borderlands pre

2986
07:02:48,900 --> 07:02:50,979
sequel and it's just like what the fuck are you doing

2987
07:02:50,979 --> 07:03:00,340
and then borderlands 3 it's just like all right it's i

2988
07:03:00,340 --> 07:03:03,380
i like borderlands 1 like borderlands 2 it's just kind of like i

2989
07:03:03,380 --> 07:03:09,880
it's we're kind of if you like just loot

2990
07:03:09,880 --> 07:03:12,919
boxes and shooting and different combinations and yeah it can be

2991
07:03:12,919 --> 07:03:15,319
addicting i just kind of got sick of it after

2992
07:03:15,319 --> 07:03:30,009
the second game i have heard the telltale borderlands

2993
07:03:30,009 --> 07:03:34,950
game is that weirdly enough i have been told that

2994
07:03:34,950 --> 07:03:42,549
tales from the borderlands is the best borderlands game

2995
07:03:42,549 --> 07:03:48,409
i've been told that a couple of times yeah i've been told that at

2996
07:03:48,409 --> 07:04:01,130
least twice it's easily the best telltale game

2997
07:04:01,130 --> 07:04:09,639
yeah um i'm trying to think of what other

2998
07:04:09,639 --> 07:04:17,099
first-person rpgs exist it's definitely dark messiah

2999
07:04:17,099 --> 07:04:21,619
that game is just so hilariously interesting

3000
07:04:21,619 --> 07:04:31,340
um a skyrim but i don't know if that does do the bethesda games

3001
07:04:31,340 --> 07:04:37,909
count because they don't they're not first person was dark

3002
07:04:37,909 --> 07:04:41,189
messiah actually a good game it seemed like a meme no it is it

3003
07:04:41,189 --> 07:04:48,549
i mean it is a meme but it's still a really fun game

3004
07:04:48,549 --> 07:05:04,229
fallout 76 those servers still on i'm actually serious

3005
07:05:04,229 --> 07:05:12,330
i don't know if they are or not uh we got some news today out of

3006

what's my favorite animal armadillo that's an easy one next question

3010
07:05:54,150 --> 07:06:01,959
but yeah there's a few games classic wow

3011
07:06:01,959 --> 07:06:06,709

3012
07:06:06,709 --> 07:06:12,419
fuck it all up my faith in blizzard is

3013
07:06:12,419 --> 07:06:16,700

3014
07:06:16,700 --> 07:06:19,580

3021
07:06:50,040 --> 07:06:53,799
where they've made like two or three really really like bogus bonehead

3022
07:06:53,799 --> 07:06:58,409
plays in the last three four years that

3023
07:06:58,490 --> 07:07:06,569
wow classic needs to be good because they had

3024
07:07:06,569 --> 07:07:11,799
war warcraft 3's remake and wild classic coming back need to be pretty

3025
07:07:11,799 --> 07:07:16,840
good or they've got to announce something

3026
07:07:16,840 --> 07:07:18,599
that they're working on because a lot of people are not

3027
07:07:18,599 --> 07:07:23,779
happy it's going to be wild classic yeah but

3028
07:07:23,779 --> 07:07:27,299
i weren't they talking about how they were thinking of changing some stuff

3029
07:07:27,299 --> 07:07:30,500
weren't they saying that they were changing things and they were trying to

3030
07:07:30,500 --> 07:07:32,819
make it like more streamlined they they did mention that they were

3031
07:07:32,819 --> 07:07:36,819
going to do stuff to it right it's i don't think it's just wow

3032
07:07:37,459 --> 07:07:48,700
patch 1.2 so who knows they might they went back on that did they did

3033
07:07:48,700 --> 07:07:52,540
they go back on that i don't know we'll see what they end up

3034
07:07:52,540 --> 07:08:02,040
doing diablo is doomed wow expansion's bad

3035
07:08:02,040 --> 07:08:06,900
hawts is dead overwatch is kind of hanging on

3036
07:08:06,900 --> 07:08:12,470
overwatch is on death's door it's a shame yeah

3037
07:08:12,470 --> 07:08:19,849
they just they dropped the ball at least a few times

3038
07:08:19,849 --> 07:08:22,889
they kind of pulled a valve but valve just before they made a bunch

3039
07:08:22,970 --> 07:08:27,939
of bad plays just like forfeited the game you know what i

3040
07:08:27,939 --> 07:08:44,299
mean wasn't these glasses although valve

3041
07:08:44,299 --> 07:08:49,049
is slowly slowly they've been working kind of behind the scenes here

3042
07:08:49,049 --> 07:08:52,250
with this whole vr stuff and they got at least three or four games in

3043
07:08:52,250 --> 07:08:55,380
development here that are going to be exclusive to

3044
07:08:55,380 --> 07:09:01,110
the index right yep yep fuck me right i think i'll

3045
07:09:01,110 --> 07:09:05,450
get the htc vibe all of a sudden hey the index is

3046
07:09:05,450 --> 07:09:09,779
coming out it's gonna have like three exclusive valve games

3047
07:09:09,779 --> 07:09:23,909
they're not exclusive thank god i was so scared there for a second

3048
07:09:23,909 --> 07:09:27,750
but valve got to that point where people were like hey what the hell's

3049
07:09:27,750 --> 07:09:30,470
going on here what's this what's this thing that you

3050
07:09:30,470 --> 07:09:33,990
released that i'm not very happy with they were just like i quit i'm done

3051
07:09:33,990 --> 07:09:36,630
making games forever bye and then it's like

3052
07:09:36,630 --> 07:09:42,500
slam the door and like put put up like an out of order sign

3053
07:09:42,500 --> 07:09:47,720
blizzard had that same scenario except they were like what about this game

3054
07:09:47,720 --> 07:09:50,919
uh that's i don't like that what about this one this one's that kind of stupid

3055
07:09:50,919 --> 07:09:52,680
too no we don't want that what about this

3056
07:09:52,680 --> 07:09:55,240
one this one sucks no we don't want that either

3057
07:09:55,240 --> 07:10:03,770
and now they've kind of buried themselves hey yeah we gotta go grocery

3058
07:10:03,770 --> 07:10:07,209
shopping oh shit that's right we're gonna go grocery shopping

3059
07:10:07,209 --> 07:10:16,700
we're almost done we're almost done uh but

3060
07:10:16,700 --> 07:10:19,659
gabe newell actually said something like people not liking mass effect

3061
07:10:19,659 --> 07:10:27,849
three caused him to stop deving on half like three really

3062
07:10:27,849 --> 07:10:30,009
valve doesn't have investors to answer to so they don't have to

3063
07:10:30,009 --> 07:10:32,810
pressure to output games yeah i think i think valve made the

3064
07:10:32,810 --> 07:10:36,009
right call with that because if they didn't think they

3065
07:10:36,009 --> 07:10:39,450
could make good products then they weren't going to make them

3066
07:10:39,450 --> 07:10:43,130
i think that's been their mo for a long time it's kind of it's

3067
07:10:43,130 --> 07:10:45,930
sucks that you don't we don't we don't get it left for dead three we

3068
07:10:45,930 --> 07:10:49,369
don't have like a big huge tf3 or team fortress

3069
07:10:49,369 --> 07:10:52,650
update right that's changes the game that much

3070
07:10:52,650 --> 07:10:57,529
we got artifact but i don't i don't play i don't that doesn't do it for

3071
07:10:57,529 --> 07:11:02,139
me at all it's a card game i don't really play them

3072
07:11:02,139 --> 07:11:06,459
and then they they just kind of went into the business side of games which

3073
07:11:06,459 --> 07:11:10,090
you could argue is you know might not been the greatest

3074
07:11:10,090 --> 07:11:13,930
thing in the grand scheme of things because that's how we kind of invented

3075
07:11:13,930 --> 07:11:18,040
the whole open boxes for money thing that was

3076
07:11:18,040 --> 07:11:25,659
valve valve kind of paved the way for that

3077
07:11:25,659 --> 07:11:29,979
the open up loot boxes for cash was like a team fortress and counter

3078
07:11:29,979 --> 07:11:37,689
strike thing tf2 crates and yeah even they took

3079
07:11:37,689 --> 07:11:42,090
that from like what those old japanese

3080
07:11:42,090 --> 07:11:53,139
mobile games right fifa yeah fifa with the card packs

3081
07:11:53,139 --> 07:11:59,060
but not like a box with stuff in it be like the card packs were just uh you

3082
07:11:59,060 --> 07:12:04,139
opened up card packs right fifa is patient zero but valve

3083
07:12:04,139 --> 07:12:10,729
really perfected that open up the box and get an item for the game

3084
07:12:10,729 --> 07:12:14,549
it's the same it is the same idea but the fifa cards didn't affect

3085
07:12:14,549 --> 07:12:30,659
anything in the game right did they did they wait hold on the

3086
07:12:30,659 --> 07:12:33,220
fifa cards i thought it was like you just opened up

3087
07:12:33,220 --> 07:12:39,299
cards and had like a card collection with like golds and stuff

3088
07:12:39,299 --> 07:12:50,540
you actually do you that's how you get the players

3089
07:12:50,540 --> 07:13:01,209
oh my god fifa is paid to win no really wow holy shit

3090
07:13:01,209 --> 07:13:11,720
okay well that's unbelievable but uh the ea fifa even as early as

3091
07:13:11,720 --> 07:13:18,549
you know team fortress that all the kind of open up boxes get new weapon or new

3092
07:13:18,549 --> 07:13:28,889
skin right they expire oh my goodness that's evil

3093
07:13:28,889 --> 07:13:33,430
if they expire you have to keep opening them

3094
07:13:33,430 --> 07:13:39,909
holy shit but i think that will they'll turn

3095
07:13:39,909 --> 07:13:44,250
well there'll be a turnaround here regardless of all the you know the

3096
07:13:44,250 --> 07:13:46,970
crazy fucked up shit that's happening in this industry right now

3097
07:13:46,970 --> 07:13:50,330
in the last four or five years and there'll be a

3098
07:13:50,330 --> 07:13:53,290
turnaround there'll be some there'll be there'll be some new

3099
07:13:53,290 --> 07:13:56,250
shit that's interesting that i think that some of these companies

3100
07:13:56,250 --> 07:13:57,689
are going to start to realize that people

3101
07:13:57,689 --> 07:14:01,049
are annoyed by this kind of behavior they don't like this shit nobody likes

3102
07:14:01,049 --> 07:14:05,830
this shit so unfortunately the people that

3103
07:14:05,830 --> 07:14:07,909
are playing the games that have been playing games for the last five to

3104
07:14:07,909 --> 07:14:11,990
ten years kind of had to be the the guinea pigs for all this stuff

3105
07:14:11,990 --> 07:14:15,349
until everyone was like hey could you stop doing this to us please

3106
07:14:15,349 --> 07:14:18,389
oh shit i'm sorry i didn't think that you don't like this

3107
07:14:18,389 --> 07:14:25,180
fucked up kind of behavior yeah i guess we'll stop

3108
07:14:25,180 --> 07:14:33,770
did you beat mario and checkers yet i smoked him

3109
07:14:33,770 --> 07:14:39,180
people love this shit it makes all the money yeah but

3110
07:14:39,180 --> 07:14:43,619
people like to gamble too you know it it's all that's all it is it

3111
07:14:43,619 --> 07:14:47,860
scratches the same itch as pulling like a slot machine lever why

3112
07:14:47,860 --> 07:14:52,979
how do you think casinos are so popular

3113
07:14:52,979 --> 07:14:57,939
it's the same idea a potential random generated thing where you could

3114
07:14:57,939 --> 07:15:07,240
get something awesome or something terrible

3115
07:15:07,240 --> 07:15:15,180
you're the expert on gambling i see i'm telling you i know

3116
07:15:15,180 --> 07:15:18,759
but i uh i gotta get out of here gotta go to the grocery store before they

3117
07:15:18,759 --> 07:15:21,880
close so let's get through the last uh handful

3118
07:15:21,880 --> 07:15:24,119
of bits let's get the credits on the screen too

3119
07:15:24,119 --> 07:15:30,439
we can sit here and talk for hours about uh the state of the game

3120
07:15:30,439 --> 07:15:36,060
industry i'm not necessarily an expert on all

3121
07:15:36,060 --> 07:15:42,500
this but i do have some opinions as you've heard

3122

3143
07:17:58,680 --> 07:18:04,180
so there's like two or three more uh but the chrono trigger kind of

3144
07:18:04,180 --> 07:18:07,540
tangent was from frody and weapon that got us on there 250

3145
07:18:07,540 --> 07:18:10,819
play chrono trigger it's an amazing game snooze and copter thanks to the

3146
07:18:10,819 --> 07:18:15,270
250 i know i could have put this in recommended

3147
07:18:15,270 --> 07:18:18,310
but i want to hear direct thoughts on it in chats too i really want to see you

3148
07:18:18,310 --> 07:18:20,950
stream a game you know and played before

3149
07:18:20,950 --> 07:18:24,470
and just show us that haven't played its secrets and whatnot

3150
07:18:24,470 --> 07:18:27,349
just guide us through and show us why you enjoy it so much

3151
07:18:27,349 --> 07:18:30,310
games like resident evil 4 chrono trigger whatever game is up

3152
07:18:30,310 --> 07:18:35,560
in your top 10 i mean i could do that

3153
07:18:35,560 --> 07:18:42,409
if people really wanted me to do that i could do it

3154
07:18:42,409 --> 07:18:47,080
play like mario rpg and show you everything and why i think it's so

3155
07:18:47,080 --> 07:18:50,360
cool and fun play chrono trigger it's it's an

3156
07:18:50,360 --> 07:18:55,159
interesting idea that'd be cool it'd be different that

3157
07:18:55,159 --> 07:19:02,619
sounds like fun yeah let's we'll plan on it let's plan

3158
07:19:02,619 --> 07:19:07,400
on it could be nostalgic mario rpg i would probably start with

3159
07:19:07,400 --> 07:19:10,619
mario rpg that's my favorite game ever made

3160
07:19:10,619 --> 07:19:15,430
so i would probably start there the drama classics

3161
07:19:15,430 --> 07:19:19,639
well i didn't make them but that's a great recommendation thank you

3162
07:19:19,639 --> 07:19:23,979
snooze and copter i've toyed with it we've talked

3163
07:19:23,979 --> 07:19:26,380
about it a few times i just never pulled the trigger on it because i

3164
07:19:26,380 --> 07:19:28,939
just don't know if people want to see somebody

3165
07:19:28,939 --> 07:19:31,740
just go oh i know what's here i know what's over here go look this is go

3166
07:19:31,740 --> 07:19:33,740
watch this part hey you should watch this part of the movie this is where

3167
07:19:33,740 --> 07:19:35,659
this is the part where you get to where he dies

3168
07:19:35,659 --> 07:19:38,779
you know i feel like i'd be that guy at the movie that tells you the cool

3169
07:19:38,779 --> 07:19:48,659
parts to watch but you know it is um it is what it

3170
07:19:48,659 --> 07:19:51,880
is maybe i'll take the uh take the dive

3171
07:19:51,880 --> 07:19:58,790
the neverhood neverhood's hard to get to work past a certain point

3172
07:19:58,790 --> 07:20:04,950
i just wish they would release it remake it somebody got gg is not on

3173
07:20:04,950 --> 07:20:09,290
top of that that's surprising but fraud in weapon

3174
07:20:09,290 --> 07:20:12,569
thanks for the 250 how dare you tell me to take care of myself the nerve of you
