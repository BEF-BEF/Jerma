1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,399
Oh, no friendly fire. We always play with no friendly fire.

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:05,780
Um, that was a nice ghost car.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,519
I like alt-tabbed. Let me fix my mouse.

4
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:11,759
That guy-

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,640
This guy just like pull up so I can get in his car. Thanks.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,439
I think he just peeped you.

7
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:16,879
It's a pretty nice car. Thank you.

8
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,550
You didn't have to- he- what?

9
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,829
He's the nicest person I've ever seen in this game and you shoot him.

10
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:28,429
I only shoot- I shot- I shot him in the ass. He'll be alright.

11
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:29,070
He's dead.

12
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,350
Have you ever seen Forrest Gump?

13
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:43,200
Yeah, thank you for coming everybody. Shady Home is Retirement Home.

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,679
Yeah, we do a garage sale every year here.

15
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,920
We make sure we have two armed guards because, you know, just in case something goes wrong.

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,560
It's been such a long day at work. I just want to park my stupid forklift.

17
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:01,890
The joke is over.

18
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:05,239
Redo.

19
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,409
You cannot fit in here with this thing.

20
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:10,290
I'm getting in.

21
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:13,260
Oh my god, it's spazzing out.

22
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:30,739
You actually got it in the garage with a jump truck.

23
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:33,540
How are you gonna get out?

24
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,980
It's gonna explode.

25
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,099
Don't let it explode.

26
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:43,340
I can't fix it.

27
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,739
I don't know how you got in here. You killed M.

28
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,030
Oh my god, the laws of physics.

29
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,200
Come on, do something.

30
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,909
Lady, lady, that was not a good place for cover.

31
00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:22,479
Crouching on the sidewalk was not a good place.

32
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,389
Look at this dipshit.

33
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:30,990
Oh, I'm gonna get him.

34
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,129
I tried, it didn't work.

35
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:59,259
All right, try to get in here again.

36
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:01,340
Where the hell did the helicopter come from?

37
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,009
This is not designed for this to happen.

38
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,340
You almost saved me because...

39
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,939
Okay, into the sky.

40
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:22,300
Into the sky with you.

41
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,000
Into the sky.

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,360
What the fuck?

43
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,539
This guy got you on the ear.

44
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:34,939
He got you on the balls.

45
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,259
This guy is taking so many bullets.

46
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:44,590
This guy is getting so ripped apart by bullets.

47
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,430
Now he runs, oh, because you're here.

48
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,590
I just want to be with Star.

49
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,590
Hey, Cobbs, remember how you were really mad at me?

50
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:00,900
Oh, hi, sir.

51
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:08,060
Weren't we just like shooting at you a quarter of a second ago?

52
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,139
This guy's kicking the shit out of me, by the way.

53
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:11,020
Can I come back you up?

54
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:12,860
You're gonna have to.

55
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,580
He's gonna kill me.

56
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:19,079
Me.

57
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,670
This guy still wants to fight you.

58
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,389
This guy is a maniac.

59
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:30,050
Oh, not anymore.

60
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,589
You gave him diarrhea.

61
00:04:32,589 --> 00:04:34,110
Oh, I've got diarrhea.

62
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,870
Oh, give me to a bathroom.

63
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,829
Oh, I've given...

64
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:40,110
Jerma, look at me.

65
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,790
I've been given too much power.

66
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,750
I know how to do this.

67
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,300
What?

68
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:45,779
I'm dead.

69
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:48,459
I'm dead.

70
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:49,259
I'm alive though.

71
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,920
It's doing that thing again.

72
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:55,279
It's doing the thing where I'm dead, but I'm not dead.

73
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,779
I just got up and...

74
00:04:57,939 --> 00:05:00,180
I'm just getting a silly shot again.

75
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:03,379
Dude, what is...

76
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:04,819
Please, let me get...

77
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:15,339
Jerma, get up.

78
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,019
Jerma, get up.

79
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:19,600
Help me.

80
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:21,199
Help.

81
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:27,009
I...

82
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:27,810
Help.

83
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:29,389
Move me.

84
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:29,949
Push me.

85
00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:30,509
Do anything.

86
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:35,069
I'm not sure you're on the same place, like on the same screen as me.

87
00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:37,629
Where are you laying?

88
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:41,629
I'm lying next to this cop car that you're rolling into.

89
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,980
I'm lying just on the ground right here.

90
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,579
I'm just getting riddled with bullets.

91
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:49,779
Yeah, I'm dead.

92
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,379
The same thing happened.

93
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,790
And I kept on getting up and getting lit up again.

94
00:05:57,329 --> 00:05:59,569
Okay, that was ridiculous.
