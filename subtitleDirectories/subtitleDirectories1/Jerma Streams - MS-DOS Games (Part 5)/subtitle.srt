00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:14,089
I just barely cleared my throat, and I saw it. I was just choked on my throat.

2
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:26,489
Thank you Kazzy for the 10 subs. Congratulations to all of you that got one. Now you can spam

3
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:34,539
Germamoon like I do. I think I've only done Germamoon like three times in the last year.

4
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,619
Is there like data on that? When was the last time I did Germamoon? One of you guys has like the data

5
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:52,679
somewhere. Wait, wait, what did I say? Like 10 times? No, I'm not gonna type that all out.

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,520
I'm not like you guys. I don't have the, I don't have the keywords for, I don't have like keystrokes,

7
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,879
key mapped. I don't do any of that. I type it out. I actually physically type out like Germamoon,

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:21,829
and then I copy it and paste it. Me too? I'm not the only one? Good. But hope you're having a good

9
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:32,069
day. Welcome back. If you were here last night, good morning. But it's, it's almost four o'clock,

10
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:36,870
so it's not the morning anymore. But anyways, how are you? We're gonna do some DOS tonight.

11
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:47,829
Pick back up, because I really do enjoy this so much. Playing these DOS games is seriously

12
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:53,269
like one of my, it's one of my like most favorite things to add to the stream. I,

13
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:58,579
I get energy off of this shit. I like live off of these old fucked up games.

14
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:13,300
How am I feeling? I'm feeling pretty good. And then tomorrow we're gonna do Terraria again.

15
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,979
Mr. Star is gonna boot his server back up, and we're gonna kind of pick up what we left off there.

16
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:29,860
And then Sunday, I have not decided what's gonna happen on Sunday, but I'm probably not gonna

17
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:41,189
stream, because I have to leave. I have to be, I have to really get ready, because it's a very

18
00:02:41,189 --> 00:03:01,319
important trip early next week. Leave, leave. He's going to Texas. No, Texas. No. For those of you

19
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:06,599
that were not here yesterday, I will go briefly. And then I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I gotta make

20
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:12,580
one of those exclamation point carnival, just so I can have like a clip of me talking about it.

21
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:19,419
Remember when I was moving to Vegas? All right, somebody clip this. Ready?

22
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:27,930
I gotta kill the audio here. Hold on. I'm gonna get this in one shot.

23
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:35,849
Hey, you clicked this because you're probably wondering why somebody wrote a hashtag carnival

24
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:42,490
in the stream chat. Let me tell you. September 21st is the carnival stream. Well, the carnival

25
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,849
stream, you know, the one that I talked about previously of you guys controlling twitch

26
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:50,409
controlled robots to play all kinds of fun midway games and carnival games, including

27
00:03:50,409 --> 00:04:09,159
dunking me in a dunk tank. That's right. You ruined it. Yeah, you gave $50. That was going so well.

28
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:14,550
And then I Oh, you guys didn't hear the sound. I did. There's not even any any

29
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:22,970
message here. I said hashtag. Oh, fuck. But all jokes aside, that was mandem requiem.

30
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:32,009
50 bucks. Thank you so much. $50. You cut me off. But I will take a $50 cut off.

31
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:40,500
Because that's an insane amount of money. Thank you. The clip is fucked up now.

32
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:53,610
Here we go. I'll give you like an easy one. September 21st 2019 is a day for

33
00:04:53,610 --> 00:05:00,089
you to remember. That's the set in stone carnival stream date. The one where you're

34
00:05:00,089 --> 00:05:05,129
going to have fun with robots at a twitch controlled carnival stream. That's right,

35
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:13,660
you're going to be in control. September 21st 2019. Maybe we'll see you there. And up until then,

36
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:19,019
I'm going to be traveling back and forth to a different state to make sure I get this

37
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:22,939
thing hammered down completely. So you might see streams pulled back, you might see streams

38
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:28,220
canceled up until the 21st. But you'll know in advance. Don't worry about that. I'm jumping

39
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:33,819
down. I'm spending I'm working on it. I'm working on it. And I'm putting time into it. Thank you

40
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:42,860
for listening. All right, there you go. This is I don't care. Just use that one. I'm not going to

41
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:51,050
redo that one. I'm almost fine. This is not the Vegas one again. I just use the first one and

42
00:05:51,050 --> 00:06:03,879
just like cut it. He's doing the Disneyland safety guide voice. Yeah, that's the voice acting voice.

43
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:15,860
Make sure to keep your arms and hands inside the vehicle. And by any means, do not get out of the

44
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:23,139
ride. Do not take any photos with flash photography. And do not take off your shoes. Too many people

45
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:44,810
been doing that lately. Keep them on. This is not a red eye from Boston to LA. Anyway. Hey, look at

46
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:54,279
that. Look what's on the screen right now. Well, not right now. In a second. Hold on. Just wait.

47
00:06:54,839 --> 00:07:01,800
You'll see it. No, you know, fuck it. No, no, no, no. No, fuck it. We're just going to open up this

48
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:09,560
one. Yeah. Here we go. We're going to open. This is streamers choice. I remember the last couple

49
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,300
times we've done this. It's been streamers choice. Streamers choice is going to be tubing.

50
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:27,029
You heard it here first. Tubing. All right, you can open your eyes now.

51
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:37,610
Tubing. Published by Dumark. Limited IBM version. Written by Hank Gecko. Okay. VGA.

52
00:07:53,589 --> 00:08:02,069
This is the song. Cut it. Cut it. Cut it. This is the song that in my mind is what it sounds like

53
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:19,750
when your computer gets a virus. I need to turn this down. Just go. All right. There we go. We're

54
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:35,210
fine. Tubing. Is this an arcade game? How do I move? W-A-S-D. Hey, what did I tell you about

55
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:51,639
keeping your shoes on? How do I move? J-K-L-V-D-B-M. Space. Q. Okay. Q is turn. Q. Okay. I tilted my

56
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:58,490
body a little bit. I'm just like in the lazy river. Oh, those are beers. I think those are

57
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:23,460
like beer cans. All right. Hold on. A is turn. S maybe. Hold S. Okay. I'm dead. I have to paddle.

58
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:50,730
Oh my God. I actually do. Throw the beer can at it. This is so sloppy. Why am I going this fast?

59
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:55,899
They did this shit in Super Mario RPG. That's where they got it from. I remember this exact

60
00:09:55,899 --> 00:10:04,059
thing happening in Mario RPG. Guys, you have to hold it. You don't have to tap it. You just hold

61
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:20,940
it. Hey, quit fishing. Oh, come on. Come on. Let me like throw like a beer can at a fisherman.

62
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:31,960
That's so fucking stupid. What a menace to society this guy actually is. I didn't bring any safety

63
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:56,220
equipment. I love how it stretches out a little more. Those fish. A thousand points. I got them.

64
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:05,019
How do I get to the end? All right. I got to stay up front. That's how you win these ones.

65
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:26,600
Oh my God. Okay. That was kind of scary. You can get eaten by an alligator. Okay. Um, that was

66
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:38,620
called tubing. You are a top shot tube, dude. Enter your initials. Pretty good. Top shot tube, dude.

67
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:50,519
Biff. Well, that was that one. Uh, we're going to move on from this one. I don't know. This one

68
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:56,419
might take us a while. I don't know. I saw, I remember got streamers choice to start this out.

69
00:11:56,419 --> 00:12:17,850
This one, uh, I never played it, but some of you probably have another virus song. Oh shit. This is

70
00:12:17,929 --> 00:12:23,700
going to be as complicated. I thought you were going to, I thought you just had to like diagnose

71
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:30,009
somebody. This is too complicated. Yeah. We're going to have to sit here for like an hour to

72
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:44,179
do a tutorial. Wait, what? As a carpool passenger, relax and daydream your way to work. Then reality

73
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:47,460
in the form of a truck smacks into you. You're not seriously hurt, but you go to the hospital.

74
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:56,759
Wait, I'm the patient. You spend hours in a waiting room. You fill out a thousand forms.

75
00:12:56,759 --> 00:13:00,840
You finally see it. Don't wait. After I got in a car accident, you're poked, prodded and rushed

76
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,759
through the system. They take blood run tests and send you away. You feel mistreated and out of

77
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:09,240
control. Time goes by your bruises heal. You put the whole experience behind you. Then the bill

78
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:14,440
shows up. What did they do? Who said they could do that? Shouldn't insurance cover this? Enough

79
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:19,639
is enough. You decide to run from public office on the platform of healthcare reform. Click the small

80
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:36,070
box in the upper left of this window to continue. Okay. Am I alive? I thought this was sim health.

81
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:49,220
Ah, how do I turn this off? Hold on. I can turn this off. Oh, it's like specifically designed

82
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:56,259
to hurt your ears. Before you can be elected to office, the voters need to know who you are,

83
00:13:56,259 --> 00:13:59,940
what you stand for, what you believe in, your personal values. I thought this was a surgery

84
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:06,870
game. The values window will show you a number of statements. You rate how much you agree or

85
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:11,830
disagree with each statement from your answers. Sim health will establish your personal values.

86
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:24,179
Why is this game like 30 years ago and like 30 years in the future? This is some weird

87
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:29,580
shit here. Okay. Your constituents and the simulation will judge you not by the values

88
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:40,730
you select, but how well you stick to them. Okay. Why? Wait, why? I thought this is a health game.

89
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:50,649
Sim health defines personal values as a balance between four ideals, liberty, equality, community,

90
00:14:50,649 --> 00:15:01,779
and efficiency. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. Individually, each of these four ideals sounds

91
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:05,860
great, but you can't have it all. Completely supporting anyone takes away from the others.

92
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:19,799
So I got hit by a truck and decided to run for president? Is that what happened? Okay. Liberty

93
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:23,639
and equality are at the opposite poles. The more liberty you have, the less equality. Community

94
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:28,679
and efficiency are also opposing forces. As you choose your values, consider how the four different

95
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:44,009
ideals can work together. Okay. Now what? You've represented with four conditions. Oh God. No,

96
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:49,429
I don't, you're not going to do, you know, I'm not going to play like the saw game right now.

97
00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:56,629
You have four choices. Each one describing four crisis points. Make your choice. I don't know

98
00:15:56,629 --> 00:16:04,570
if I want to do this. In the first room is a man who's just like you was hit by a car,

99
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:16,330
choosing him, removes both of his legs. In the other room, two families, one of which

100
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:23,350
shit the bed last night. What are you, what, make no choice. I don't, I'm not doing this.

101
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:38,490
Yeah, that joke was ruined because I couldn't come up with like a safe way to have to have

102
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:43,460
you press the button on the family. You know what I mean? Like I had to abort that one.

103
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:48,860
There's no, like there's no way I could have, I could have turned that around.

104
00:16:55,559 --> 00:17:02,139
I had to, I had to get that away from that one. All right. Anyways, let's go. I'll do one.

105
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:39,930
I'm fucking out of this. I'm not doing this. I'm not exploring the United States healthcare system.

106
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:58,549
Oh, was that the Willy Wonka song? Willy Wonka, the famous chocolatier. Hey,

107
00:17:59,509 --> 00:18:05,940
this is the same song.

108
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:45,619
This is a binaural beats in my fucking head. Mr. Three, the bomber, dead eye. Mr. Three,

109
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:57,220
skill level one. Target. Yeah. Hello and welcome to the All-Star Basketball Association's three

110
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:02,819
point shooting championship. I'm Skip Smiley. The world's best shooters are here to settle once

111
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:06,660
and for all. That guy on the right can't believe he's on camera. The winner will have his name

112
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:12,500
engraved on the championship trophy alongside the name of last year's champ. Okay. That guy

113
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:18,259
clearly didn't have any lines. He just won the, that guy won the contest to be on stage with the

114
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:29,000
guy that people think is cool. All right, here we go. Joining me is the ever exciting Rick Vitality.

115
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,680
He will be giving us expert analysis as the championship goes on. Glad to be here, Skip.

116
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:40,359
It's going to be three point city, baby. Without any further ado, let's have a look at this year's

117
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:46,039
field. Same guy. Just that's the same guy. Here's the thing. I got to show this on camera. Same guy,

118
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:52,980
except the one difference is he turned his mouth to the side. Is it you go from this to this,

119
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:58,859
all you do is just turn your mouth. Is it just like tilt your mouth and talk out of the side of your

120
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:15,109
mouth. I didn't turn the face cam on. Whoops. Oh, well that looks like a strong field to me.

121
00:20:15,109 --> 00:20:19,750
What do you think, Rick? This is going to be an exciting tournament. We should see some

122
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:26,150
fantastic shooting. Any predictions for the first round, Rick? Barclay might as well pack his bag.

123
00:20:27,589 --> 00:20:31,990
You know, the muffins, when some muffins have the guy underneath with the real hands,

124
00:20:33,349 --> 00:20:36,549
that he is out of his league. It's two puppeteers.

125
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:45,109
We'll win easily. Long Poppin' is going to say bye bye to Johnson. No problem at all.

126
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:53,430
I'll take Thomas in a close one over, Mr. Three. Anything you say, Rick. Well, let's go down to

127
00:20:53,430 --> 00:21:01,589
the court as the first round is ready to begin. Okay. Bald Barker. This is not me.

128
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:09,109
We don't have to sit here and actually watch this, right?

129
00:21:17,049 --> 00:22:18,740
Deal. I'm playing that fucking dumb game. All right, let's go. I got pretty bad picks so far.

130
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:27,990
I'm not gonna lie. The first two, three games, pretty bad picks. Let's see if I can pull this

131
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:49,369
out here with... This one might be all right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Why did I pick... No,

132
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:57,420
I didn't. I didn't do like more of these, did I? It's another fucking politics game. It better not

133
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:14,069
be. How was I... Look, the name of this game is Floor 13. Not anything to do with like politics.

134
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:19,640
I thought this was gonna be like a scary game or like a point and click horror game or something.

135
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:55,960
What? Okay. How do I go? Welcome new DG. Decor style. Modern or traditional?

136
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:02,869
Modern. Please type the name... Please type your name in block capitals.

137

I'm sorry. I mean, I do appreciate the fact that you give me the form, but I'm...

138
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:15,430
It's kind of a sleazy way to give me your Mario Maker level. I don't do that,

139
00:24:16,309 --> 00:24:36,519
but thanks for the deed to the house. I appreciate it. That's not how I sign. Okay.

00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:45,319
Surveillance. Four removal. Two assassins. Pursuit four teams. Look,

143
00:25:05,529 --> 00:25:19,240
All right. I don't even open the door. I go home. Hey, you're the new DG. Oh dear. Well,

144
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:24,119

145
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:32,970
yourself unless you enjoy flying. I want to see results in three weeks. Is it on my house?

146
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:52,470
Okay. Let's go in the office. Read reports. See polls. Suspects. Groups. All right. Okay.

Them and us. Sure. Anyways, let's read the report. Please note that the food mixer stolen from L1

Okay. Mr. James Radcliffe, leader of the Hackney Council, has declared the London Borough a

154
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:05,940
nuclear-free zone. The nuclear train carrying waste through the Capitol may have to be diverted.

155
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:24,740
He wants a nuclear-free zone. Likes folk music. Okay. Give orders. Pursuit. Search.

156
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:38,869
He stole the coffee maker. We're going in for a heavy assault. That was her re-gift.

157
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:58,920
Uh, it's about 6, 6, 11 p.m. All in the hour. That's what, that's what jeopardy reruns the day

158
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:07,529
tomorrow. Wait, wait, wait. What? We're going, like, how many, like, people are going?

159
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:15,640
Is this, like, an FBI thing? Is this an FBI thing? Or is this, is this an FBI thing?

160
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:36,920
Okay. Give orders. And let's, uh, interrogate. Um, abduct Radcliffe in order to prepare for

161
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:59,180
interrogation. May take up to three days. And search. Just ransack the place. So, I'm gonna,

162
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:05,980
when do these happen? This is, like, we're just fucking, fucking up this whole guy's life.

163
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:14,180
And then, uh, how do I, like, get away from, I don't want to, oh, okay, I'm on the same file.

164
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:31,980
Okay, hold on. What about, uh, is that it for reports? Um, all right, leave reports. Let's

165
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:40,230
take a look at the polls, see if we get a chance. What about, what is groups? Oh, okay.

166
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:52,039
It's not even the right guy. Suspect. It's not even the right guy.

167
00:29:57,029 --> 00:30:13,930
Okay, it's time to leave desk. No, no, no, no, leave desk. Go to the department. Go to the,

168
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:32,519
hold on. What do you mean, go to the department? Let's go back to my door. There's a new report

169
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:58,390
in for you. It's the next day. Okay, there's a new, um, is that it? Did we, did we find him?

170
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:16,250
Good morning, sir. There's some new reports for you. The Prime Minister will see you tomorrow

171
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:23,700
morning. Interest arrested in Paris. Time to get a hold of high tech equipment. All right.

172
00:31:28,390 --> 00:32:17,849
So, um, wait, what happens? No, he's already dead. What? That's so fucking stupid.

173
00:32:20,009 --> 00:32:28,380
What is it? I don't even understand. Okay, we're gonna, let's interrogate. No. All right,

174
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:35,500
go back. Go, I want to see the other suspects. There. Okay, give orders.

175
00:32:37,880 --> 00:33:02,980
Uh, pursuit. Okay. This is like, what I'm doing right now is what happens when your cat runs over

176
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:20,630
your keyboard. It's like, oh shit, Jesus, I can't change it. We already went through. Uh, thank you

177
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:33,079
too. Call me bomb for the 50 bucks. 5,000 bits just came in. 5,000 bits. They say, hey man,

178
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:37,240
I'm not great at Twitch. Just want to send you a little something. You've helped me deal with the

179
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:46,119
stress of nursing school and now I'm an actual pediatric nurse. There you go. Hell yeah. You

180
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:50,279
help a lot of people and you mean a lot. You mean a lot to us as well. Thanks for all the laughs,

181
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:54,599
buddy. Also dodge right when you fight the abyss walkers in Dark Souls 3. Thanks.

182
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:04,890
Always dodge left. Have to dodge left every time, but congratulations. That's awesome.

183
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:10,570
Actual. I told you guys, doctors are in here. Everybody. Everybody talks about, hey man,

184
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:14,730
you always bring up how there's doctors in your chat. Uh, we got another person in the medical

185
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:32,780
field here. Nurse, doctors, scientists. Uh, thank you. Prime minister says, ah, don't attack people

186
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:38,380
with high public profiles or the chattering classes will start asking questions. Get serious. We'll

187
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:44,440
start flying lessons. I don't know what that means. And why am I not allowed in his house?

188
00:34:45,079 --> 00:35:18,139
No, no, no, no, no. Stay here. See operations. Suspect under surveillance. Suspect being tailed.

189
00:35:18,139 --> 00:35:26,300
Address marked for assault. All right. I think I've had enough of this one is to

190
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:42,630
eliminate. I might as well just see what happens. I want to see what the prime minister means.

191
00:35:52,869 --> 00:36:00,730
Phone rings. Hey, my phone in my office. Hello. Uh, this is the interrogation department here.

192
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:05,769
We feel it may be a little pointless abducting Mr. James Radcliffe as corpses don't do much

193
00:36:05,769 --> 00:36:12,139
talking. Yes. I'm very sorry about that. My cat ran across my keyboard. Oh, okay. No,

194
00:36:12,139 --> 00:36:30,260
that happens over here too. All the time. Yeah, I know it sucks. All right. Goodbye. Bye. I need

195
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:36,219
to go to, is he still alive? All right. Let's, what happens when you just get, okay. Well,

196
00:36:36,219 --> 00:36:39,980
what happens if you just get rid of everybody? Wait, no, no, interrogate, interrogate. No,

197
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:46,940
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Stop. No, don't. Okay. Tail him. This is like a Pee Wee Herman

198
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:58,059
skit going on right now. First we stab him and then we grab him and then we kill him. I say we

199
00:36:58,059 --> 00:37:20,500
let him go. Next, come on. All right. Give orders. What the fuck was that? All right. Search.

200
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:40,789
Make sure you do it a couple times and then like do it sneakily because we're going to like trash

201
00:37:40,789 --> 00:37:45,909
this guy's place and then after like a day or so he's going to put out all the good stuff out

202
00:37:45,909 --> 00:37:54,090
and then we're going to go in there and do it discreetly and find it. All right. Let's go.

203
00:37:54,730 --> 00:38:09,590
There's some new reports for you. I mean, we might as well just see this to the end

204
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:26,500
because this is... I'm doing like a fucking clown show right now. Wait, what? Uh, hold on a second.

205
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:35,179
Dave Holtz. Suspect leaves. Suspect returns at... Okay, so he went to work.

206
00:38:38,739 --> 00:38:45,139
All right. He got up in the morning. He left to go to work. At 5 30 he came home from work.

207
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:54,920
At 6 51 after taking a shower, he went back to... Oh, no, no, he left. He probably went out somewhere

208
00:38:54,920 --> 00:39:03,300
like the grocery store. At 8 p.m. we attacked his house while he was at the grocery store

209
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:16,599
or out to dinner and then he came back at nine. Why did we not get a reaction here? What does

210
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:23,079
that mean? Attacked? Premises attacked? Did we just like drop a fire out of his house?

211
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:31,989
Is he going to be like upset about this? The police have puzzled this. The reason for the

212
00:39:31,989 --> 00:39:47,110
military-style attack on the home of Dave Holtz. We set up like turrets and like fired a fire. This

213
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:55,179
is the guy that's been dead for like four days, by the way. This guy is in the morgue right now

214
00:39:55,179 --> 00:40:05,190
and I guess, unfortunately, who fortunately was not there at the time. All right, well,

215
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:22,250
let's go. Lead reports. Suspects. How would you not be suspicious of this right now? All right,

216
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:31,300
give orders that we're going to pursue. Yeah, just follow them around. That's fine.

217
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:45,400
I can't like do... Can I actually... What about removal? What does that mean? Removals?

218
00:40:52,469 --> 00:41:12,869
No, no, no. Removals. Immediate removal. You can't ruin the public standing. Just run like a smear

219
00:41:12,869 --> 00:41:24,199
campaign on the guy. Like this is... That's terrible. All right, I'm gonna leave. We're

220
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:36,980
currently... What about this? Lead desk. Next day. There are loads of new reports in for you. Uh-oh.

221
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:43,860
This is the part of the show when there's a big... Everything is dark and there's one giant floodlight

222
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:48,500
on the door and I'm standing way in the back and it's one big light on the door and there's really,

223
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:57,349
really creepy, nervous music playing. Loads of new reports. Okay.

224
00:42:07,699 --> 00:42:13,460
Exclamation point. Removal department here. Mr. James Radcliffe already dead.

225
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:26,869
Mr. James Radcliffe already dead. Somebody typed that up real fast and didn't put proper

226
00:42:26,869 --> 00:42:45,829
punctuation or spacing or anything. Stop doing that. He's dead. I can't do anything. Uh-oh.

227
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:52,550
The PM will see you tomorrow morning. I can just imagine... That's like, that's like an old person,

228
00:42:52,550 --> 00:43:01,539
right? When they're writing. I come tomorrow. Pick up. They just want to get their point across.

229
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:11,500
I come tomorrow. Pick up. Food. Are you hungry? That's like, that's like, like my father talks.

230
00:43:24,949 --> 00:43:29,190
Subject, okay. Subject leaves home, returns home. Subject leaves home. Subject returns subject

231
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:49,739
of 3 a.m. We got a new spot. Subject leaves home, goes to Whitehall, returns home, leaves home.

232
00:43:50,300 --> 00:44:04,329
Subject arrives at Frog Street. Suspect or location file attached. Okay. So the search party found

233
00:44:04,329 --> 00:44:10,650
nothing of interest at the home of Mr. Philip Bone. The search party found nothing of interest at the

234
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:27,050
home of Mr. Philip, but we left the place in a mess. That's okay. Interrogation report.

235
00:44:30,409 --> 00:44:37,610
Prisoner in cell, Dave Holtz. Where is your headquarters? There isn't one. Are you

236
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:42,650
involved in a conspiracy? I have rights, you know. Are you a member of a secret society?

237
00:44:43,369 --> 00:44:58,440
Do you know who you're talking to? Whoever's doing the interrogating is not really doing a great job.

238
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:07,960
You don't start with, are you involved in a conspiracy? You find that out. You figure that

239
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:29,030
out. Inactive. Oh, because it's very, very, being tailed. Uh, different disinformation unit.

240
00:45:29,829 --> 00:45:34,010
So what does that do? We're just going to like lie about, we're going to spread like a social

241
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:39,510
media like rumor about him or something that he like, what are we doing? Are we like spreading

242
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:44,630
rumors, lies? Are we doing like a campaign? I don't understand what that means. Propaganda?

243
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:19,769
Yeah, get rid of that. Let's do, um, yeah. All right, let's go. Next day. Next day.

244
00:46:30,219 --> 00:46:35,260
Oh, yes. The thing slides. Oh, you're welcome. Yes, sir. I just had the palace on the phone.

245
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:39,179
I don't want to your dirty work getting into the papers or your history. Do you know what

246
00:46:39,179 --> 00:46:52,619

248
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:25,820
do with that? So you have an HQ. What is your name? Dave Holtz. Who's your contact? I won't talk.

249
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:35,699
Where's your headquarters? What do you intend to do with that? Means I have a headquarters.

250
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:45,690
But why would I tell you? All right. Yeah, he's he's gonna talk. Suspect under interrogation.

251
00:47:49,000 --> 00:48:05,739
Suspect focus of smear campaign. Suspect under surveillance. Okay. All right. Now keep it up.

252
00:48:10,789 --> 00:48:31,510
That's all right. Let's go. Interrogate. That signature was made in MS paint.

253
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:45,510
Disinformation department here. Mr. Philip Owen has already been smeared. We can't risk the

254
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:58,340
suspicion another campaign might arouse. Okay, fine. Fine. It's more. Okay. Next report. Here we

00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:26,119
society? All right. We're gonna have to let him go. How do I let him go? interrogate remove

Interrogate. Like, no, no, no, no, abduct him. Abduct him. He's already here. All right, abduct

261
00:49:44,139 --> 00:49:47,980

262
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:52,599
walk him out the door, walk him out and back into the door. Take him like on a car ride,

263
00:49:52,599 --> 00:50:05,960
and then put him back in the same room. All right, and then let's do it again.

264
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:33,659
What's this guy doing? And then we're gonna bring this guy in and convince him he's the other guy.

265
00:50:33,659 --> 00:50:45,320
Okay, let's see what happened. What? Interrogation department here. We're not actually sure where

266
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:52,019
Dave Holtz is. Oh, sorry, I recognize that picture. That suspect is already here.

267
00:50:52,019 --> 00:50:55,860
The Prime Minister of fucking Munchkinland. We'll see you tomorrow morning.

Subject leave, subject return, subject leave, subject return, subject abducted. Did it? Hold on

00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:17,980
a minute. Are you involved in a conspiracy? What? Are you a member of a secret society?

270
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:23,690
The National Unit of Municipal Workers are hardly a secret. Okay, where's your headquarters? There

271
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:46,179
isn't one. Okay. So, so we've got to let him go. We can we've got to let him go. Prisoner in cell

272
00:51:46,179 --> 00:51:53,619
two, Mr. Philip Owen. Are you involved in a conspiracy? Up yours piss head? Who do you work

273
00:51:53,619 --> 00:52:07,099
for? Doesn't say anything. What's your name? Ask my mother. Huh, okay. Give orders. Infiltration.

274
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:16,260
What is infiltrate? Oh, wait, infiltration? 100 agents.

275
00:52:23,159 --> 00:52:30,539
Okay. So what you mean to say is, all of us, it's just only going to be cover agents. We're

276
00:52:30,539 --> 00:52:34,059
all going to be like winking at each other and like bumping into each other like the coffee maker.

277
00:52:37,289 --> 00:52:41,369
100 fucking cover agents at this place that probably only has what like 100 people in it.

278
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:55,130
Let's go. It's 250. We're going to make up a significant portion. But okay, if this 250,

279
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:59,690
what happens when 100 people get hired? We all have to get hired. How do you we can't infiltrate

280
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:10,119
that many? Does the National Union of Municipal Workers plan on expanding their workforce by like

281
00:53:10,119 --> 00:53:26,519
35%? We're creating jobs. We're creating like fake inflated jobs. Okay, let's go.

282
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:45,420
Infiltration in progress. All right, let's see the polls. Oh, oh, oh, oh, we're, we're,

283
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:59,909
we're four points behind. That was 50 more dollars that came in. A lot of money coming

284
00:53:59,909 --> 00:54:07,980
in today, guys. Seriously. Thank you for that. This is like another 50 fucking dollar drop.

285
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:20,710
This is from Jay Zanye West. Thank you for the 50 bucks. Due to work, I'm away from family and

286
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:25,190
friends a lot. My girlfriend and I watch your streams and content together. So watching while

287
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:30,250
I'm on the road makes me feel a little closer to home. Thanks for the amazing content. PS What

288
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:40,170
are the odds of a scare Saturday's reboot? Well, first of all, thank you. That's I'm happy that

289
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:46,630
you guys have something to connect. If it's here, if it's this community, if it's this stream, then

290
00:54:47,269 --> 00:55:00,420
that makes me fucking happy. Being away from people that you love is hard. But as I'm really

291
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:07,030
happy that you and your girlfriend have that. So thank you. What are the odds of a scare Saturday

292
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:15,079
is coming back? Pretty much I would say probably zero chance. Because I would just play any new

293
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:20,780
horror game that comes out regardless. I don't think it has to be like on a set day. But I just

294
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:35,800
want to be completely and totally just open about that scare every day. So you're saying that there

295
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:42,280
is a chance there is a chance. But I really do. Oh my god. I do appreciate the $50 on top of the

296
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:51,929
other $50 that La Cranda just gave right now. Holy shit, guys. All right. Thank you La Cranda

297
00:55:51,929 --> 00:55:56,090
for the 5000 bits. It took me three weeks to save up this money. I won't have enough to pay the bills

298
00:55:56,090 --> 00:56:05,079
after this. But the streamer needs money. You better be paying the bills first. You better you

299
00:56:05,079 --> 00:56:12,920
better be paying the bills like five times over before you give me a cent. But thank you so much

300
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:26,199
for the $50 fucking dollars. Both of you, all of you. All right, let's uh, okay, let's see what

301
00:56:26,199 --> 00:56:34,039
happens tomorrow. Let's we're gonna we're infiltrating with our hundred person agent team.

302
00:56:39,059 --> 00:56:53,179
Uh oh, this guy's got a lot of threats. Let me do this thing again. Remember this? Hey,

303
00:56:53,179 --> 00:56:57,980
you're becoming a serious liability. Questions are being asked in the house. Do you want to

304
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:25,579
follow the last DG? Get serious or start flying. Let's see what happens. To the shredder. For

305
00:57:25,579 --> 00:57:30,219
security reasons, all references to the following will be removed from our current records.

306
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:40,460
Mr. James Ratcliffe. Okay, because he's been he's been dead for like five days. All right.

307
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:48,059
Infiltration report. All assigned agents penetrated. They were on a hiring boom.

308
00:57:48,699 --> 00:57:55,659
Number of agents successfully penetrated. A hundred. Initial penetration successful. Infiltration

309
00:57:55,659 --> 00:58:06,440
has risen to over 25% of core membership. Now what the fuck do you want us to do? Because

310
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:12,150
a couple of issues have arisen and I'm going to bring up very briefly. Because there's so many of

311
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:18,760
us, we all try to do the same job. We all try to go to the bathroom at the same time to use our

312
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:24,679
communicators in our ears. And it just looks kind of weird when 40 people go to the men's bathroom

313
00:58:24,679 --> 00:58:30,619
at the same time. And 30 people go to the women's bathroom at the same time. And we all as we need

314
00:58:30,619 --> 00:59:00,570
a bit of solution will be hat will be good. We're starting to arise suspicion. What next? 40 plus

315
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:04,250
30 equals 100. No, that what about the other? Okay, what about the people that have to stand

316
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:18,309
watch outside the bathrooms? 100 people all just get up from their chairs. Like bugs to a light.

317
00:59:22,539 --> 00:59:33,829
Group infiltrated. Okay. Dave Holtz has been here for four days. A member of a secret society.

318
00:59:33,829 --> 00:59:40,630
That's not a secret. Well, sooner or later, it's going to be our society. Because I'm going to

319
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:52,260
send another 100 agents in there. Two-fifths of the company is infiltration. That's so

320
00:59:52,340 --> 01:00:06,579
stupid. I don't have one. I don't have contact. Okay. Give orders. Now there's nobody left to

321
01:00:06,579 --> 01:00:15,559
all right now let's do a disinformation campaign on the inside. You know how easy that would be?

322
01:00:16,199 --> 01:00:22,280
Tell the tell the the fucking 40% of their workforce to stop trying. Just sit there and

323
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:26,679
like spin a pencil around in your hand all day. They will lose so much productivity if you guys

324
01:00:26,679 --> 01:00:35,980
just like browse Reddit all day. That we could completely control this. We don't even need to

325
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:47,019
put out like a false report. Okay. Let's lead reports. Let me go look at the suspects again.

326
01:00:50,969 --> 01:01:00,420
Next suspect. All right. What do we get? Under interrogation. Orders. I got to remove. How do

327
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:18,809
I get somebody out of interrogation? This is not going to work, right? This is not going to work.

328
01:01:20,409 --> 01:01:35,750
Imagine if you send in like a huge military team to to where we are. Yeah, we're going to

329
01:01:35,829 --> 01:01:47,179
we're sending in like a big like raid on ourselves. No. The guy's just sitting there in a chair like

330
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:53,500
waiting for the next guy to come in to interrogate me. The door opens. The creeks open like

331
01:01:54,219 --> 01:02:04,389
what the hell's going on there? And fucking flash can comes in. 50 people. Come get it.

332
01:02:14,949 --> 01:02:19,079
All right. Let's go to let's go to the department. Interrogate. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

333
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:35,050
Check captives. What does this mean? Procedure zero. Procedure one. What's procedure two?

334
01:02:35,769 --> 01:02:55,989
Procedure two? Procedure two. Hold on. My cell phone plan? No, that's that's the cell. Okay,

335
01:02:55,989 --> 01:03:07,579
hold on. That's the cell. That's not right. Suspects. Right. Okay. Okay. We've got there.

336
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:23,590
We're on two. Cell plan. Dental plan. Insurance. Home orders. Insurance. Okay. But anybody had no

337
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:39,690
past confessions, right? So what is phase two? All right. What about this the disinformation

338
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:59,320
campaign? I'm saying the guy was an alien. Lies. Lies. Lies. National unit slash slush funds

339
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:23,130
stand at 88,000. We're already doing this. All right. That's fine. Let's go back to the door.

340
01:04:23,849 --> 01:04:29,989
So we were doing like extra interior. I don't know what that means. What is two? Procedure one.

341
01:04:29,989 --> 01:04:42,570
Procedure zero. Procedure two. What does it mean? Apparently I haven't read all the reports. Yes,

342
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:55,940
I know. You send me this every day. Yeah, I've read all the reports. There are lots of new reports.

343
01:04:55,940 --> 01:05:10,619
Okay. Political damage minor. Opposition MP Mr. Barry Matthews revealed a secret bill outlining

344
01:05:10,619 --> 01:05:14,940
government plans to sell off national parks. The leaked document concluded that many parks

345
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:28,630
could easily be turned into golf courses and country clubs. All right. What? Um, isn't that

346
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:39,159
the same? Hold on. Mr. Barry Matthews. MP disgruntled. Suspected. Suspected affiliation

347
01:05:39,159 --> 01:05:43,079
to National Federation of Labor. Suspect holds opinions not supported by the government.

348
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:54,619
Okay. There's a new suspect. Subject has been held looking pale. Okay. What's your name? Dave

349
01:05:54,619 --> 01:06:01,980
Holds. What are you involved in? Who do you work for? Num W. The subject is being tortured

350
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:17,829
to British standards. No, I don't want to. What? What does that mean? Oh, they both being like

351
01:06:17,829 --> 01:06:45,800
told. What is my God? What is your name? Help. How many are you? Go on punk. Make my day. All

352
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:59,539
right. I've got a group infiltrated group smeared. They're just like fighting each other.

353
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:05,079
They're just talking shit to each other. They're just making fun of each other.

354
01:07:05,639 --> 01:07:29,750
What a perfect smear campaign. All right. Let's see. Suspects. But how do I, what do I do?

355
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:35,429
How do I do this? I need to like get them out of interrogation. He's been here for too long.

356
01:07:47,909 --> 01:07:55,349
Removal. But is this kill? Or is this just remove? There's a dispose and then there's a remove.

357
01:07:56,230 --> 01:08:15,579
All right. I have to go back to the departments. Leave desk. Interrogation. I'm going to say

358
01:08:15,579 --> 01:08:50,100
dispose. That means remove is kill. Dispose is leave, right? Oh, no, no, stop, stop, stop,

359
01:08:50,100 --> 01:09:00,460
stop, stop. Dispose. Remove is it's worded weirdly. Remove is kill. Dispose is get out.

360
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:15,619
Right? Or else how else would I let them out of interrogation? It's not the other way around.

361
01:09:17,899 --> 01:09:29,140
You can't remove somebody. That's new reports. Let's see. Dispose is what villains ask their

362
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:49,560
henchmen to do. I know, but it's two people got fired. Boss, I was just doing the thing you told

363
01:09:49,560 --> 01:10:00,619
me to do. I sat around. I played flash games. I went to the bathroom like 15 times. I told

364
01:10:00,619 --> 01:10:20,420
extended breaks. Why are we? Why did we get fired? Is that it? That's it. So is he actually? All

365
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:39,220
right. Deceased. Next. So what the fuck does removal do? Yeah, I know. It's like the cartoon

366
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:49,000
villain gives his monologue at the end and says dispose of them. And then like the Batman throws

367
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:55,220
the thing and it like hits like three or four switches and then he gets trapped. I know,

368
01:10:55,220 --> 01:11:13,510
but how do I get him out of the interrogation room? Hold on. What does this do? Oh, yeah.

369
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:28,520
Removal, huh? Assassinate George Cox. Yeah, that's removal. What? All right. We're going to

370
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:41,989
search his house and then we're going to tail him. I'm going to laugh my ass off if the first person

371
01:11:41,989 --> 01:11:48,550
that we did like the military strike to was like the mole or whatever the whole time. And I can't

372
01:11:48,550 --> 01:12:06,380
end the game because I'm softlocked. Okay, let's give orders here. Surveillance. Yeah. And we're

373
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:11,689
going to discreetly search. You know what? Just no, no, no, no, no. Discreet, discreet, discreet,

374
01:12:11,689 --> 01:12:24,069
discreet, discreet, discreet. Did I already do that? Discreet. Okay. What is even the point

375
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:43,770
of like heavy assault? That doesn't seem to, why? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

376
01:12:43,770 --> 01:12:57,720
Back it up. Couple of new reports. See if we got any info. PM, we'll see you tomorrow morning.

377
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:06,760
Mounting political damage. Matthews has again embarrassed the government. Revelations that

378
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:11,800
industrialists are receiving back handers from the government in order to exaggerate output

379
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:18,939
figures have been vehemently denied by the Department of Trade and Industry. Under surveillance

380
01:13:18,939 --> 01:13:25,670
being tailed, marked research. Okay. So the other ones being we can just go to tomorrow.

381
01:13:26,390 --> 01:13:36,729
I do this every time. My sludge brain just goes back into the office every day again.

382
01:13:37,449 --> 01:13:47,420
Is he going to do it a third time? Is he going to do the Oz slide the thing? No, he's not.

383
01:13:47,979 --> 01:13:57,189
The Prime Minister says, I don't want to read derogatory remarks about this government and

384
01:13:57,189 --> 01:14:17,579
the press. Keep troublemakers quiet. I want this sorted out now. We must continue. Hold on.

385
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:23,239
Document. We must continue our plan to wreak havoc and chaos at every level of organized

386
01:14:23,239 --> 01:14:29,000
government. Switch the device on in the specified place in Morton on Stanley three days before the

387
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:34,520
election. I've set down a false trail. So Philip and thus you will not be under suspicion. The blue

388
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:57,930
none. Oh, all right. Matthews is two more people got fired. I'm not even sure this is how the polls

389
01:14:57,930 --> 01:15:13,770
look. Oh, we're gonna lose next suspect. Okay, so this is this is the guy that's like causing

390
01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:34,779
all the other issues, right? Um, what do we do? Disinformation. No, he said I can't if I do that

391
01:15:34,779 --> 01:15:52,710
again, then I'm gonna be in big trouble. I can't do it. I can't do a light. No, I remember he said

392
01:15:52,710 --> 01:15:58,220
don't do that again. You're getting too much info. Let's see what happens if we do some

393
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:24,779
misinformation. Let's go. You want? No, just wait. We need to see if we can do this. Correct.

394
01:16:28,229 --> 01:16:43,560
New report. Wait a minute. Subject arrives at 150 Goward Gardens. Subject returns home, leaves

395
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:54,359
home, goes to the pub, leaves the pub, returns home. Okay. Suspect or location file attached.

396
01:16:55,079 --> 01:17:28,020
Oh, there's a new executive of Megacorp. Friend. Oh, we found this is him. All right. Next report.

397
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:45,899
So wait, wait. We did a smear campaign and denied. Okay. Next report. That worked. All right. Again,

398
01:17:45,899 --> 01:17:54,119
do surveillance. Sign the order. All right. All right. All right. Hold on. We're getting there.

399
01:17:54,680 --> 01:18:13,979
Let's take a look at the polls. We gained a point with four days. Now I've removed the

400
01:18:13,979 --> 01:18:23,609
surveillance. It's all right. We got what we need. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know the guy that I have

401
01:18:23,689 --> 01:18:36,979
is definitely the blue nun, right? Nothing of interest in Mary Matthews home. Two more agents

402
01:18:36,979 --> 01:18:49,770
have been fired. Well, okay. Wait, hold on a minute. We are causing constant chaos and infiltrated with

403
01:18:49,770 --> 01:18:57,979
our entire workforce, all the agents to try to get this guy, Dave Holtz. Dave Holtz has been

404
01:18:57,979 --> 01:19:07,609
dead for like five days. So what are they doing here still? I think I need to pull them out and

405
01:19:07,609 --> 01:19:19,989
put them somewhere else. Okay. Hold on. Let's leave one person. No agents. Wait, are they just

406
01:19:19,989 --> 01:19:26,020
stuck there? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Can I pull them out? I think I can pull

407
01:19:26,020 --> 01:19:32,970
them out. Yeah. All right. I'm going to pull them out and then we're going to go somewhere else.

408
01:19:35,590 --> 01:19:43,779
Suddenly 90 plus people quit. Thank you for the opportunity. I really appreciate it. All right.

409
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:58,340
Let's go pull them out. All right. We have infiltration groups. Okay. See operation.

410
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:09,050
Okay. We next group. Yeah. Okay. Here we go. Hold on. Mr. Barry Matthews. So we're all everybody

411
01:20:09,050 --> 01:20:22,340
pull out from here. Zero, no agents. All right. Everybody quit. Everybody walk next door. Wait,

412
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:44,460
how come I can't pull everybody out? Do they not want to quit? Okay. Wait, give orders. No agents.

413
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:55,800
Okay. Let's wait. We have maybe we have to wait for them to quit. See operations. All right. Let's

414
01:20:55,800 --> 01:21:14,220
see what happens. I just, I got to get them over to the other place. Again, the same. I just had

415
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:32,329
the palace on the phone. Don't get serious. Okay. Let's see if we can pull them out. See groups.

416
01:21:33,050 --> 01:21:48,090
Core size 251. Okay. Give orders. Oh, six agents. What happened to the other group?

417
01:21:52,180 --> 01:21:57,899
Why can I not? Did they make their own organization? What happened? Did they all

418
01:21:57,899 --> 01:22:11,779
leave? I only have six agents. Come on. Is this one like all those people left blizzard to make

419
01:22:11,779 --> 01:22:33,180
wildstar? No. Hey. All right. So we have six people left. I can't believe this. All right.

420
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:55,479
Well, we're going to send. This is our sixth best. Send them all. Infiltrate. Okay. I guess we're

421
01:22:55,479 --> 01:23:13,060
going to. What happened to our 96 agents? Hold on. For security reasons, all references to the

422
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:18,420
falling will be removed from our current records. Dave Holtz, Mr. Philip Owen, George Cox, and the

423
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:27,340
National Union of Municipal Workers. So they all still are there, but now they just work there.

424
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:41,159
They just are employees there now. Well, I guess you just work there. Okay. That's still fucking

425
01:23:41,239 --> 01:23:51,659
funny. Oh, we have two gaining. Hold on here. Being tailed, being discredited. Okay.

426
01:23:52,460 --> 01:24:08,970
How's that smear campaign? All right. Surveillance, pursuit, search. No, no, no, no.

427
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:23,829
We can't do anything crazy here. Let's just. No, no, just stay tailored on my guess. What's

428
01:24:23,829 --> 01:24:29,960
going on next here? Suspect. Okay. Right. All right. Okay. All right. Let's go.

429
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:44,500
We're gaining like a point a day. What if it's a 50-50? There's a Mr. Garcia waiting to see you.

430
01:24:45,300 --> 01:25:33,960
Who's that? I was. We were winning. We were winning. We were gaining a point a day. All right.

431
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:47,000
Well, we saw that one to the end. I have a few more streamers choices, but I think we can do a

432
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:56,500
chat choice now. Let's see. Let's make sure we're in the right spot from where we were last time.

433
01:25:57,319 --> 01:26:07,350
Well, this sim health. Okay. Okay. I think, yeah, this is, I think I remember doing this one,

434
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:15,159
but I think that was a streamer's choice. Okay. Are we good? I do. Oh, by the way,

435
01:26:15,159 --> 01:26:20,039
I already have that one. Let's move this down. Remember, it's the ones that you can actually

436
01:26:20,039 --> 01:26:41,189
see the text on. Here we go. Please click on your screen in just a second. Do it now.

437
01:26:41,590 --> 01:27:16,359
Yeah. Family feud. What's the other one? God. Captain Bible or family feud. All right. Thank

438
01:27:16,359 --> 01:27:37,880
you for voting. I think we got it. We're going to do captain Bible. What the fuck even is cap? What

439
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:57,239
is captain Bible? Oh man. Okay. Oh, this is like hanging my computer. Why is this hanging my

440
01:27:57,239 --> 01:28:06,970
computer so hard? Come on. Let's go. Stop this. Why is it? I'm, I'm hanging. My computer is just

441
01:28:06,970 --> 01:28:28,760
hanging. Fire is penetrated. Oh dear. Well, uh, has anybody seen any good books lately?

442
01:28:29,399 --> 01:28:50,199
Cause I'm stuck right now. I got a wheel. Hold on. What is going on? Fucking cap Bible,

443
01:28:50,199 --> 01:29:09,079
whatever the hell it is. What is going on? You're killing me. I may need to, uh,

444
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:28,359
do some control. Oh, there we go. Okay. We're good. Captain Bible. Thank God. Here we go.

445
01:29:30,170 --> 01:29:43,510
What was that? There was, there was once a, there was once a city far from us in a place

446
01:29:43,510 --> 01:29:49,750
and time which had been imprisoned in the dome of darkness. In vain, the Bible Corps fought to free

447
01:29:49,750 --> 01:29:54,789
it from its captivity. They would have lost hope for one last desperate plan that called for the

448
01:29:54,789 --> 01:30:09,819
help of their greatest champion. Why is captain Bible assaulting Hogwarts in the Star Fox land

449
01:30:09,819 --> 01:30:25,060
master? What the fuck is going on? Oh, I came as quickly as I could. Is that captain Bible or am I

450
01:30:25,060 --> 01:30:30,520
captain Bible? Thank you for coming captain Bible. I've asked you to come here because this city has

451
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:35,960
been taken by the enemy and we haven't been able to break his hold on him. He planted a tower of

452
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:41,720
deception inside generating a dome of darkness. That dome is actually an anti-truth field. It

453
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:49,239
makes people very prone to being deceived. Why don't we just storm the city and take it by force?

454
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:54,680
Because we've only been able to open a small hole in the dome and that hole is very unstable.

455
01:30:55,399 --> 01:31:01,159
So how do I fit into this? It's funny to use that phrase because we are sending you through that

456
01:31:01,159 --> 01:31:07,739
hole into the city. So what do I do when I get inside? Can I expect any resistance? What about

457
01:31:07,739 --> 01:31:19,739
the people? Should I expect any problems with my computer Bible? Your computer Bible might be damaged

458
01:31:19,739 --> 01:31:24,859
going through the field so we've been sending in scripture stations where you can get verses for it.

459
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:31,880
Why is he so sad? Yes, I saw them outside. How will I know where to find them? You should already have

460
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:41,819
the maps that we sent you. They show where the station should be. Okay, um, what do I do when I

461
01:31:41,819 --> 01:31:47,819
get inside? Your mission will be to knock out the tower of deception which is generating the dome.

462
01:31:48,619 --> 01:31:55,819
How do I do that? You will need to use the city's unibot. We'll put you as close as we can to it,

463
01:31:55,819 --> 01:32:00,699
but you'll need to get help from seven other people in order to operate it. The seven deadly

464
01:32:00,699 --> 01:32:08,520
sins. The seven deadly virtues, whatever the fuck they're called. All right, let's go. This music's

465
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:15,859
gonna make me crazy. Now before you go, I think we should pray. Lord, please help

466
01:32:15,859 --> 01:32:20,340
Captain Bible on this mission. Please keep him safe and let your truth overcome the darkness of

467
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:45,909
deception. Amen. Okay, wait, wait, wait. Normal, easy, or different? All right, hold on. I have to

468
01:32:45,909 --> 01:32:53,340
exit. This shit is fucking gonna kill my ears. All right, that's all right. That's better.

469
01:32:57,689 --> 01:33:15,140
I'm not gonna do difficult. I'm gonna do, I should do easy, if anything. I can give you

470
01:33:15,140 --> 01:33:20,569
trivia answers. Is it? No, I'm doing normal. I'm not doing difficult in Captain Bible.

471
01:33:21,449 --> 01:33:35,260
So am I in the dome of deception? Faith. Your faith is at 100%. Okay, is this like a roguelike?

472
01:33:35,340 --> 01:33:51,590
What is this? No verses loaded. Oh, this is my Bible computer. Get a verse. Verse loaded. Genesis

473
01:33:51,590 --> 01:33:57,270
127. So God created man in his own image. In the image of God, he created him, male and female.

474
01:33:57,270 --> 01:34:01,029
He created the, I don't know the rest. I have no idea. I've got to go to the Bible machine,

475
01:34:01,029 --> 01:34:09,529
ATM, to find out what happens next. The trouble he causes recoils on himself. His violence comes

476
01:34:09,529 --> 01:34:24,840
down on his own head. What the fuck? It doesn't matter what you say, just what you do.

477
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:31,880
So God created man in his own image. In the image of God, he created him,

478
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:33,720
male and female, and then created them.

479
01:34:54,579 --> 01:35:02,949
I thought I instantly died. So wait, I have to use Bible verses to stop the robot murderers.

480
01:35:03,590 --> 01:35:12,600
All right, let me go look at my map. Holy shit. Are you serious? Look at this. This is too big.

481
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:20,680
This is too much. Wait, hold on. There's another verse.

482
01:35:23,140 --> 01:35:28,739
The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole person,

483
01:35:28,739 --> 01:35:33,220
sets the whole course of his life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell.

484
01:35:44,579 --> 01:35:50,180
The tongue is also fire, a word of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole person,

485
01:35:50,180 --> 01:35:55,619
sets the whole course of his life on fire, and it is itself set on fire by hell.

486
01:36:05,590 --> 01:36:05,989
Is that it?

487
01:36:17,779 --> 01:36:23,180
What about this one? That looks like it's going to dig into my body when I walk forward.

488
01:36:32,170 --> 01:36:33,770
Cyber lie incoming.

489
01:36:48,550 --> 01:37:03,989
What? How do I do true or false? So God created man.

490
01:37:03,989 --> 01:37:17,260
No, this is not right. Off. It's a cyber lie. I don't have that yet.

491
01:37:25,770 --> 01:37:30,250
Here comes another cyber lie. Here we go.

492
01:37:37,479 --> 01:37:42,409
Where is it? Right here.

493
01:37:58,729 --> 01:38:02,760
Defend. Got it.

494
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:23,500
Power. Uh oh. Again, you're a fluke of nature. No, I am. I am of God.

495
01:38:26,550 --> 01:38:39,989
What is that laser? Incoming cyber lie detected. It doesn't matter what you say, just what you do.

496
01:38:43,319 --> 01:38:48,760
The trouble he causes recoils on himself. His violence comes down in his own head.

497
01:38:49,399 --> 01:39:00,890
The tongue is also fire. Here we go.

498
01:39:09,579 --> 01:39:19,720
I'm at 49%. What happens when I run out of faith power?

499
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:28,279
Hold on. I need to see a map. Trap. Trap. Prayer chapel. I'm just going to go down, I guess.

500
01:39:33,479 --> 01:39:47,420
I need more verses, don't I? Here we go. No, wait. It's this one. Right? Which one was it?

501
01:39:47,420 --> 01:40:08,539
Oh, no. I couldn't do this one yet. I had to run away. What about in here? What do I need to go?

502
01:40:08,539 --> 01:40:13,640
So I can't go down. Go up and to the right or to the left and then down.

503
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:19,460
Let's try over here. Here we go. New verse.

504
01:40:21,399 --> 01:40:24,600
That he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the scriptures,

505
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:29,319
and that he appeared to Peter and then to the twelve after that. He appeared to more than five

506
01:40:29,319 --> 01:40:33,560
hundred of the brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen

507
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:42,920
asleep. I need to match to unlock. It is most important to totally love God and to truly love

508
01:40:42,920 --> 01:41:07,319
people also. The tongue is also fire. I don't think it's any of these. I have to go down from here.

509
01:41:08,409 --> 01:41:13,020
Yeah. Oh, we got another one.

510
01:41:19,829 --> 01:41:20,310
Sounds good.

511
01:41:30,140 --> 01:41:34,939
All right. This is like using the world card in Binding of Isaac.

512
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:40,489
Restore my faith. Give me the sword of the spirit. Give me the shield of faith.

513
01:41:40,489 --> 01:41:43,850
Warn me of traps and snares. Light my path before me.

514
01:41:49,939 --> 01:42:01,659
Light my path before before me. How much faith do I have? I don't know. Thank you, Lord. I believe.

515
01:42:02,539 --> 01:42:09,220
Lord, please give me the sword of this. Light my path before me. Where in the Bible does it

516
01:42:09,220 --> 01:42:24,939
talk about God lighting my path? I don't know. Lord, please give me that cool sword.

517
01:42:25,659 --> 01:42:34,520
What does it talk about? The sword of the spirit. Hey, Lord, I could use some more things.

518
01:42:38,119 --> 01:42:49,619
Lord, please. Where in the Bible does it talk about avoiding traps? Right here. Right? Avoid like the...

519
01:42:50,260 --> 01:43:07,720
Here we go. Did it work? I'm not very good at this. Okay, I got full health. What's in here?

520
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:14,140
All right. Here we go. An easy one. When Jesus died, he stayed dead. After all,

521
01:43:14,140 --> 01:43:29,979
nobody saw him after the crucifixion. Got you. All right. So now what do I got?

522
01:43:29,979 --> 01:43:49,850
I might be able to go up now. What was this one? The rainbow is just light refracting through water,

523
01:43:49,850 --> 01:44:01,579
not a creation of God with a divine purpose. Uh-oh. That's a cyber lie.

524
01:44:02,220 --> 01:44:26,060
Are we sure this is not just like a scientist with a helmet on? Uh, this Genesis? No, none of these

525
01:44:26,060 --> 01:44:48,229
work. Scientists are liars. All right, what about this one? Match. No, no, I don't have this one yet.

526
01:44:48,789 --> 01:44:57,850
Do I have this one? I have to be able to go one of these ways. Let's confront the cyber lie.

527
01:44:58,409 --> 01:45:04,810
Here we go. Children are born pure and innocent. If you let them do whatever they want, they will

528
01:45:04,810 --> 01:45:34,409
grow up with great wisdom. This one. Oh, oh, that didn't work. Uh, what is it? My son,

529
01:45:34,409 --> 01:45:46,140
if citizen types do not give in to them. Dude, there are people dressed like this in Stormwind,

530
01:45:46,140 --> 01:46:03,180
okay? A bit like the hammer. They can just walk by him? But this is, that wasn't a very good trap.

531
01:46:03,739 --> 01:46:07,659
But this is what the high and lofty one says. He who lives forever, whose name is holy,

532
01:46:07,659 --> 01:46:12,939
live in a high and holy place, but also with him who is contrite and lowly in spirit to revive

533
01:46:12,939 --> 01:46:24,090
the spirit of the lowly and to revive the heart of the okay. Here we go. Doesn't matter what you

534
01:46:24,090 --> 01:46:44,699
say, just what you do. It was palms, right? No, it was a tongue is also fire. Nice. All right,

535
01:46:44,699 --> 01:46:53,300
what does it look like about left me go up? All right, let's confront the cyber lie here.

536
01:46:54,180 --> 01:47:09,140
Do unto others before they do unto you and you'll get away with it. What? That's, that's palms. Do

537
01:47:09,140 --> 01:47:23,930
unto others before they do unto you and you'll get away with it. That's a pretty sick shield.

538
01:47:23,930 --> 01:47:34,539
Look at that. Look at the back. That's a nice shield. Yeah, he's going to kill me.

539
01:47:45,750 --> 01:48:03,130
He'd make that stuff. That's not good. 38% faith. Come on, give me a, uh, give me a heal room. Cast

540
01:48:03,130 --> 01:48:10,659
all your anxiety on him because he cares for you. Right. All right. Unlock match to unlock.

541
01:48:12,340 --> 01:48:34,760
It takes discipline to get the foolishness out of a kid. What? What the fuck? I don't,

542
01:48:34,760 --> 01:48:50,920
I don't know if we have this one. Seek God and he will answer you. Peter, cast all your anxiety

543
01:48:50,920 --> 01:49:01,350
on him because he cares for you. Or I live in a high and low, but I was also was trying to lowly

544
01:49:01,350 --> 01:49:22,760
spare this one. Is it Peter? Didn't open. Didn't open. Did I lose faith to that? No. Another cyber

545
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:37,479
lie. If a gang tells you to do it, then you just gotta do it. What, what, what is even the context

546
01:49:37,560 --> 01:49:57,319
here? Proverbs? No, this thing's going to kill me. Thank God for, I mean, like honestly, thank God.

547
01:49:57,319 --> 01:50:11,500
Right. I said that a lot, but for real. Oh, when do you just die? He stayed dead after. No, no, no,

548
01:50:11,500 --> 01:50:27,939
it's, uh, here it is. All right. I haven't bought one of these yet. Folly is bound up in the heart

549
01:50:27,939 --> 01:50:50,279
of a child with the broad. Okay. Okay. What the fuck? It's not, that's not fucking no. The sword,

550
01:50:50,279 --> 01:50:57,319
I can get the sword though. Yeah. I don't think you guys realize how much like fucking

551
01:50:58,279 --> 01:51:26,100
Monka S shit is inside of the Bible. We do realize. Lord, please give me the sword of the spirit.

552
01:51:26,100 --> 01:51:33,689
Where in the Bible does it talk about the sword of the spirit? The sword of the spirit.

553
01:51:33,689 --> 01:51:45,079
Here it is. That was a very holy, uh, legend of Zelda melody thing. The one that, whatever,

554
01:51:45,079 --> 01:52:00,359
forget it. It's not important. All right. I'm going to go up so I can unlock this door now.

555
01:52:04,220 --> 01:52:07,739
Can I use this or do I just have it? Oh, you hit harder in battle.

556
01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:14,060
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Foolishness. Uh, no child should be foolish.

557
01:52:14,779 --> 01:52:35,100
Wait, what the fuck is it? It's proverbs. All right. Open the damn door. What has, what is going on?

558
01:52:39,449 --> 01:52:50,149
Okay. Whose picture is that? The new lamb of God. What? He's Jesus incarnated.

559
01:52:50,550 --> 01:53:07,960
Oh, what the fuck is going on? He is not. Uh, he's not. He is too. He is not. He is too. He is not.

560
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:12,279
Go away. Okay. But I'll be back. We're going to bring my dad and he's going to tell you that

561
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:34,329
that's not Jesus. Uh, no, hold on. I'm back. Would you like to talk to me? No, you must be from

562
01:53:34,329 --> 01:53:44,020
Babylon. You are not a true believer. Whose picture is that? What? The Bible shows that there

563
01:53:44,020 --> 01:53:55,659
is no reincarnation. Oh, that's how we, we do the, that's how we, uh, I don't get it. I, I don't get

564
01:53:55,659 --> 01:54:11,819
it. Go away. Okay. But I'll be back. I don't get it. All right. So we're going to go, uh, down.

565
01:54:12,699 --> 01:54:21,989
Do I have this one? Shit. Okay. Let's try this one. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

566
01:54:21,989 --> 01:54:34,140
stop, stop, stop. What the fuck? Some Christians have changed their minds and become atheists. That

567
01:54:34,140 --> 01:54:54,710
proves that the Bible is full of lies. The tongue is also fire. The sword of the spirit. What?

568
01:54:55,350 --> 01:55:08,739
I don't think I have this one. Can I go up to the right? All right. Go through

569
01:55:08,739 --> 01:55:18,859
and just, I might have, stop! Why does that have to happen? There we go. Okay. They will,

620
02:08:34,439 --> 02:08:56,539
of god i don't think that's that clear though he will let's try this one nope you don't lose

621
02:08:56,539 --> 02:09:06,649

02:09:07,210 --> 02:09:18,409
guessing the password i don't have this all right do i have the thing that's necessary to

623
02:09:19,800 --> 02:09:37,899
okay what that's reincarnated there's no such thing as reincarnation and i'll prove it uh he was

624
02:09:37,899 --> 02:09:48,279
buried that he was raised on the third day no this is proving reincarnation this is me proving that

625
02:09:48,279 --> 02:10:02,729

remember that one all right did i get this one no one cares uh yes they do he does

630
02:10:58,260 --> 02:11:19,029

636
02:12:42,170 --> 02:12:53,859
god wants to kill the sinners before they get a chance for uh to repent no no no no where is it

637
02:12:53,859 --> 02:13:14,229
we just got it we just got it what the hell is it called the one where it's like i don't want to

638
02:13:14,310 --> 02:13:35,020
i want you to turn away from ezekiel here it is there we go here we go persevere all right

639
02:13:35,020 --> 02:13:39,579
jesus replied love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all

640
02:13:39,579 --> 02:13:45,020
your mind this is the first and greatest commandment and the second is like it love your neighbor as

641
02:13:45,020 --> 02:13:54,470
yourself all right keep me from the snares they have laid for me from the trap set by the evil

642
02:13:54,470 --> 02:14:00,630
doers okay now i can see all traps in snares so what is in this door it looks like a boss door

643
02:14:00,630 --> 02:14:19,909
save it all right uh warn me of uh traps and snares what was it called i don't i just got it

644
02:14:19,909 --> 02:14:37,079
i don't remember what the hell it was there we go so now what does that mean do i have light my path

645
02:14:38,310 --> 02:14:51,880
as well as restore faith okay i don't think i have light my path before me yet no i don't have it

646
02:14:57,819 --> 02:15:08,470
that's it there's one more area i still don't have a thing about reincarnation do i have to

647
02:15:08,470 --> 02:15:26,520
run back of course i do not bad this is not considered a trap all right up left and up

648
02:15:27,239 --> 02:16:06,520
see if we can get in there seek god and he will answer you i don't know if we have this no love

649
02:16:06,520 --> 02:16:21,050
the lord apart from me no none of this is about he who hates me hates no no no we can't get in here

650
02:16:23,380 --> 02:16:31,260
shit so i the only way the place i can go is up here there has to be something i can do up there

651
02:16:31,260 --> 02:16:40,889
because i can't do anything else over here why is it blinking oh all the way up go go go go those

652
02:16:40,889 --> 02:16:54,629
are trap doors oh okay it just blinks if it's trap door all right let me get in here i got it is

653
02:16:54,629 --> 02:17:06,489
most important to totally love god and to truly love people right i have this with what i would

654
02:17:10,729 --> 02:17:22,940
there it is right that's it get in oh god none of these this is like hurts my head

655
02:17:23,819 --> 02:17:37,690
i really don't want it this is another one of those like jump warps it is for freedom that

656
02:17:37,690 --> 02:17:42,010
christ has set us free stand firm then and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of

657
02:17:42,010 --> 02:17:57,659
slavery okay i'm almost at the end of the game guys it's almost done the greatest christian

658
02:17:57,659 --> 02:18:15,500
commandment is that you go to church no it is not it is the what is it where is it that's like the

659
02:18:15,500 --> 02:18:34,819
the greatest commandment what was it yes is it let him do anything don't let him attack

660
02:18:40,870 --> 02:18:46,629
uh all right but even if we are an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one

661
02:18:46,629 --> 02:18:52,709
we preach to you let him be eternally condemned what does that do for me though oh shit this is

662
02:18:52,709 --> 02:19:04,940
a spider what did you come from jesus told one truth other teachers have of other truths you

663
02:19:04,940 --> 02:19:11,879
should believe them just as much as jesus we just got it there it is all right we have never fought

664
02:19:11,879 --> 02:19:38,440
the spider before though i don't know i don't know what to do here did he give up what i was

665
02:19:38,440 --> 02:19:45,049
kind i like i cut like all of his legs off you couldn't have just like liquefied him or something

666
02:19:48,059 --> 02:19:56,250
all right well that's trapped through there you don't need the bible as long as you have something

667
02:19:56,250 --> 02:20:04,579
to eat uh no there's one specifically about bread in here where is it you can like eat you can live

668
02:20:04,579 --> 02:20:20,729
off of bread alone right there it is i can't believe i'm gonna beat this game that's i don't

669
02:20:20,729 --> 02:20:26,629
know why but for some reason this is like unbelievable to me oh shit we gotta save it

670
02:20:26,629 --> 02:20:40,309
right here this is the hard one uh i have to do this here we go holy god would never associate

671
02:20:40,309 --> 02:20:46,549
with an insignificant speck of protoplasm like you no it's like though we're god is us and we

672
02:20:46,549 --> 02:21:08,709
are god right which one is it um no no no no no it's um which one is this is it um here it is

673
02:21:09,350 --> 02:21:12,549
i am the vine you are the branches of a man remains in me and i and him he will bear much

674
02:21:12,549 --> 02:21:30,780
fruit apart from me you can do nothing here we go right john 15 five that's not it he who lives

forever whose name is holy i live in a high and holy place but also with him is oh yeah it's this

676
02:21:35,020 --> 02:21:50,379
one all right i just this guy hits hard so why was that guy so much easier than the last one

677
02:21:52,389 --> 02:22:03,399
like i mean we're talking 10 times easier than the last one all who sin apart from the law will

678
02:22:03,399 --> 02:22:07,319
also perish apart from the law and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law

679
02:22:08,360 --> 02:22:16,469
okay so you're judged by the law don't like break the law law all right let's go again

680
02:22:16,469 --> 02:22:25,420
no law when jesus daddy stayed dead after nobody saw him after the okay this is the one we're here

681
02:22:25,420 --> 02:22:34,709
it's genesis right no no no which uh which one is it right here which one is it right right right

682
02:22:34,709 --> 02:22:39,219
where is it where is it where is it where is it where is it where is it where is it which one is

683
02:22:39,219 --> 02:22:52,649
it where is it where is it where is it which one is it where is it there it is and oh he's to open

684
02:22:52,649 --> 02:23:06,649
his eye okay that's how i how did i shoot him that many times and not hit his eye i don't know how

685
02:23:06,649 --> 02:23:12,489
all right that's a that's a trap over there let's do this among this is probably like a uh holy room

686
02:23:12,489 --> 02:23:20,090
yes all right i'm not going to use this heal because i probably need it do i have the light yet

687
02:23:20,729 --> 02:23:35,559
this is a big circle i almost probably i think i almost have them people can't be expected to

688
02:23:35,559 --> 02:24:00,409
live by god's laws uh la la la la la we just got it which one is it galactus i'm getting pretty

689
02:24:00,409 --> 02:24:07,750
good at this just as a man is destined to die once and after that to face judgment die once

690
02:24:08,950 --> 02:24:23,690
no reincarnation we can bring it back i have almost explored everything you don't have to

691
02:24:23,770 --> 02:24:39,989
accept jesus in order to love god um i don't know you don't have to accept yeah where's the

692
02:24:39,989 --> 02:24:50,969
one that like you you have to be the branch the branch right he who hates me hates my father

693
02:24:52,200 --> 02:25:05,370
all right this is every i think i got them all johnson grew powerful because he walked

694
02:25:05,370 --> 02:25:12,500
steadfastly before the lord is god the before the john grew powerful because he walked steadfastly

695
02:25:12,500 --> 02:25:25,780
before the lord is god lord like the path lord the random spider real power is obtained through

696
02:25:25,780 --> 02:26:05,239
intimidation and manipulation law i don't know which one that is seek you uh is it this one

697
02:26:06,360 --> 02:26:21,139
it is that one that's funny it's just funny all right now let's go light our path go prove that

698
02:26:21,139 --> 02:26:42,520
reincarnation doesn't exist that's not it that's not it which one is it i think i have them all

699
02:26:49,750 --> 02:27:09,770
lighting a path i think i have every single one well i'm just gonna heal all right let's

700
02:27:10,649 --> 02:27:24,360
go oh there's two up here all right let's go back this is the no that's a that's not that's a

701
02:27:24,360 --> 02:27:48,120
where's the jump door here it is all right we go prove reincarnation see if we can open the door

702
02:27:48,120 --> 02:28:11,719
opposite so i need to go down left up i'm wholly invested in this i mean a w h oh like holy all

703
02:28:11,719 --> 02:28:22,340
right hey i'm back oh whose picture is that okay oh there is no such thing as reincarnation and

704
02:28:22,340 --> 02:28:33,780
i'm back and i got the bible to prove it and uh let me scroll through here just as man is

705
02:28:33,780 --> 02:28:39,860
destined to die once and after that to face judgment if people can only die once then that

706
02:28:39,860 --> 02:28:46,760
means that they can't come back as babies and die over again well maybe but he's still the new lamb

707
02:28:46,760 --> 02:28:51,959
of god he is the holy one who has the new holy revelation that was never mentioned in the bible

708
02:28:51,959 --> 02:28:58,950
that proves that he's true well the bible talks about people who preach a different gospel

709
02:28:58,950 --> 02:29:12,569
it's the angel one or is it but even if okay how can he be holy when the bible calls him accursed

710
02:29:13,129 --> 02:29:22,100
do the eyes just move the eye with the eyes looking at her last time he's always been so

711
02:29:22,100 --> 02:29:27,209
good to me and guided me into the new truth and accepted me into his family just because he seems

712
02:29:27,209 --> 02:29:38,940
nice that doesn't mean that he doesn't have an ulterior motive listen to this verse uh listen to

713
02:29:38,940 --> 02:29:46,260
this one just because he seems nice that doesn't mean that he doesn't have an ulterior motive

714
02:29:46,899 --> 02:29:52,389
where is it where is it it's the one that's like one of the first ones

715
02:29:52,709 --> 02:30:11,379
the tongue is fire yeah where is it where is it hold on i don't know if it's this one

716
02:30:11,940 --> 02:30:48,100
the romans no what is he seems nice i live in it no but oh my son if sinners entice you do not

717
02:30:48,100 --> 02:31:16,420
give into them right this might be it maybe let's try it i don't get it no reincarnation okay where

718
02:31:16,420 --> 02:31:28,149
is it i gotta start like i can't even like burn these into my brain i don't even remember which

719
02:31:28,229 --> 02:31:36,250

720
02:31:36,250 --> 02:31:49,000
to burn these i'm not like that religious or anything like i don't want to okay uh and then

721
02:31:49,000 --> 02:32:00,090
this is it's the this one okay now we have he's nice to me but that doesn't just because he seems

722
02:32:00,090 --> 02:32:06,069
nice doesn't mean that he doesn't have an ulterior motive i don't even we might not even have this

723
02:32:06,069 --> 02:32:22,579
one keep me from the snares maybe the yeah i'll try the one the um the only one this is the only

724
02:32:22,579 --> 02:32:41,260
one that makes any sense no do i don't i don't even have it i'll come back i'll be back again

02:35:03,979 --> 02:35:14,520
that's a faith room here we go you don't need god in your day-to-day life only in emergencies

734
02:35:15,239 --> 02:35:21,379
i think we have this one it's the one we're like i'm the vine and you're the

735
02:35:22,020 --> 02:35:50,389
whatever there it is torched oh dear god this is an emergency right there's another verse over here

736
02:35:50,389 --> 02:35:59,829
let's get it for the son of man is going to come in his father's glory with his angels and then

737
02:35:59,829 --> 02:36:11,989
he will reward each person according to what he has done okay what does that mean

738
02:36:28,280 --> 02:36:36,280
this game is fucking stupid this game is fucking really dumb i'm just like piecing this together

739
02:36:36,280 --> 02:36:48,200
right now i've been here for like 40 minutes it's starting to click it's actually starting

740
02:36:48,200 --> 02:37:08,729
to hit me now if jesus comes again who cares it won't affect us okay that's uh where is it

741
02:37:09,370 --> 02:37:14,680
you know when you do something for long enough that you forgot that you've been doing it for

742
02:37:14,680 --> 02:37:18,120
that long and then you've just you're kind of like why have i been doing this for this long

743
02:37:18,840 --> 02:37:32,969
that's it's starting to creep up and like the music is keep me okay jesus comes back who

744
02:37:32,969 --> 02:37:56,569
cares it's this one no which one is it i was just on it there here we go then he will be

745
02:37:56,569 --> 02:38:15,850
reward each person right this is the one right vital power watch out for false prophets they

746
02:38:15,850 --> 02:38:25,829
come to you in sheep's clothing and there we go we just completed that quest quest completed

747
02:38:27,020 --> 02:38:48,360
let's do it but first was the uh was that prayer room left down left right up

748
02:38:48,360 --> 02:39:20,659
left down whatever i'll find it down right down left left okay i'm back i've got more

749
02:39:20,659 --> 02:39:29,219
things in my bible computer the bible says there's no such thing as reincarnation

750
02:39:32,920 --> 02:39:38,540
where is it it's like if you if you die you die once right what does it say it it's one of these

751
02:39:39,100 --> 02:39:55,159
there it is okay and then this is the the angels one which is this one no this one

752
02:39:56,659 --> 02:40:08,299
okay and then we have the next one here it comes are we ready do not listen to a wolf in sheep's

753
02:40:08,299 --> 02:40:17,860
clothing it was matthew here we go done your new lamb is nothing but a fake and he just wants to

754
02:40:17,860 --> 02:40:29,190
use you he wants to use you up is that kind of scary he's a false christ he lied to me

755
02:40:29,190 --> 02:40:35,049
that means that god lied to me no no no no oh no no no no no god even though that mean that

756
02:40:35,049 --> 02:40:46,709
man was unfaithful and lied to you that doesn't mean that god's a liar oh shit uh-oh this is kind

757
02:40:46,709 --> 02:40:58,299
of backfiring on me uh even though that man was unfaithful god isn't a liar here uh take some

758
02:40:58,299 --> 02:41:35,530

759
02:41:35,530 --> 02:41:40,010
not have faith will their lack of faith nullify god's faithless not at all let god be true and

760
02:41:40,010 --> 02:41:53,559
every man a liar got it not everyone believes in god but that doesn't affect him just because

761
02:41:53,559 --> 02:42:03,079
men lie and deceive that doesn't mean that god lies lots of people lie so i can still trust god

762

there is a red or purple shell in mario's inventory mario speaks uh okay i think i

1243
04:45:21,319 --> 04:45:31,380
understand read the story the mushroom kingdom is in great mourn ever since the governor of the

1244
04:45:31,380 --> 04:45:37,779
mushroom kingdom had received an urgent stress call from princess toadstool his daughter of

1245
04:45:38,419 --> 04:45:49,139
princess toadstool accompanied by luigi for her safety were making trips across the land

1246
04:45:49,139 --> 04:45:56,900
looking for mystery super mushrooms the call was made from the royal family's submarine somewhere

1247
04:45:56,900 --> 04:46:01,860
near the northern hemisphere of the planet called the yoshi's world the message was simple the

1248
04:46:01,860 --> 04:46:07,459
princess and luigi were trapped on the shore of lake hamhurst where their submarine had been

1249
04:46:07,540 --> 04:46:13,540
wrecked by a violent storm at sea this is where mario's role comes to play mario must make his

1250
04:46:13,540 --> 04:46:24,360
way to lake hamhurst to all right enough to rescue the princess in luigi why does mario have to do

1251
04:46:24,360 --> 04:46:31,270
the job you ask well when bowser heard word about the princess and luigi being stranded on the

1252
04:46:31,990 --> 04:46:39,110
shore of lake hamhurst he sent his goons out to stop any i can still hear it stop any rescue

1253
04:46:39,110 --> 04:46:44,709
ships from coming to the rescue it seems bowser is up to his no good the only one who is capable

1254
04:46:44,709 --> 04:46:50,950
of beating bowser's good goons and rescuing the princess and luigi by the way luigi forgot his

1255
04:46:50,950 --> 04:46:57,509
firefowl hour at home leaving him powerless against bowser's goons is mario this this is

1256
04:46:57,509 --> 04:47:03,930
still going this situation would not be as bad as it by the way trying to read this

1257
04:47:04,900 --> 04:47:11,689
like purple the purple text with no outline on this background is i have to like cross my eyes

1258
04:47:12,250 --> 04:47:17,450
the situation would not be as bad as if it would be however mario was just recently taking a

1259
04:47:17,450 --> 04:47:24,330
vacation from just had rescued the princess from bowser a month earlier is not in the area yoshi's

1260
04:47:24,330 --> 04:47:30,409
world as such mario must travel from the planet he is now on to yoshi's world four planets way

1261
04:47:30,409 --> 04:47:35,930
however he must stop this is predictive text i feel like i'm i wrote this on an iphone line by

1262
04:47:35,930 --> 04:47:42,250
line he must stop on each planet to pick up the key which only then can he continue his journey

1263
04:47:42,250 --> 04:47:47,369
on the next planet bowser is also making his way through therefore mario must battle against

1264
04:47:47,369 --> 04:47:53,689
bowser's goons time is against mario as he must make it to the submarine wreck princess and luigi

1265
04:47:53,689 --> 04:48:19,189
before bowser does will mario become the hero once again okay let me welcome to my shore

1301
04:55:16,779 --> 04:55:22,860
just observe the patient for now no we are hold on i'm not going to operate let's uh an ult what's

1302
04:55:22,860 --> 04:55:34,330
an ultra scan uh referral somebody else to do this no let's do an x-ray let's find out let's get an

1303
04:55:34,330 --> 04:55:39,669
x-ray of your stomach and see if we can see anything is that the stuff that's not the stomach all

1304
04:55:39,669 --> 04:55:58,090
right is there anything here i didn't see anything observed you diagnosed this and recommended

1305
04:55:58,090 --> 04:56:02,330
treatment were incorrect and you have been taken off the case report to medical school on the

1306
04:56:02,330 --> 04:56:12,840
double dr wilson called from the lounge on line four medical school is the first door on your

1307
04:56:12,840 --> 04:56:21,669
right better go now all right when the nurse tells you that you have received a phone call it is

1308
04:56:21,669 --> 04:56:27,430
considered poor protocol not to return the call you may use the phone on the front desk your beeper

1309
04:56:27,430 --> 04:56:32,389
should tell you the correct extension to call in your last case your physical examination of

1310
04:56:32,389 --> 04:56:38,150
the abdomen was incomplete you must be sure to palpate all four quadrants of the abdomen

1311
04:56:38,150 --> 04:56:42,549
including the sides of the lower abdomen and the navel area for the exam to be effective so i did

1312
04:56:42,549 --> 04:56:48,979
an exam in your last case you ordered an unnecessary x-ray the patient's symptoms did not indicate a

1313
04:56:48,979 --> 04:56:54,180
need for an x-ray padding the hospital bill in this manner is frowned upon at tool works general

1314
04:56:54,180 --> 04:57:02,169
this concludes class for now thank you for attending okay dr wilson on number four okay call

1315
04:57:04,619 --> 04:57:23,639
call for the line four how do i use the phone like 004 number four it really is

1316
04:57:23,639 --> 04:57:32,500
triple zero four this is dr wilson thanks for calling back keep sharp today that's all is it

1317
04:57:32,500 --> 04:57:39,180
you have a patient in room four last door on your right here we go are you sure what are you talking

1318
04:57:39,180 --> 04:57:47,979
about should go she left last door on the right patient is 24-year-old male patient was admitted

1319
04:57:47,979 --> 04:57:52,779
complaining of acute abdominal pain accompanied by nausea cramping and generalized weakness okay

1320
04:57:53,659 --> 04:58:03,139
all right let me take a look that feels all right no problems here no pain there that doesn't hurt

1321
04:58:03,779 --> 04:58:11,939
right there right here all right it's on the left side all right i think that's that's the kidney

1322
04:58:11,939 --> 04:58:20,279
right no is that the gallbladder okay so right here that's like a side flank pain that's uh what

1323
04:58:20,360 --> 04:58:31,259
is that okay so you're not no only down here in the lower lower left side of your stomach

1324
04:58:31,259 --> 04:58:39,540
i'm thinking we should uh lower left of the stomach flu-like symptoms maybe medication

1325
04:58:40,939 --> 04:58:53,610
or maybe do an ultrasound or refer to a gastroenterologist maybe some pain relief

1326
04:58:53,610 --> 04:59:08,470
and then a referral no i would just i would be it would be referral what you recommend a course of

1327
04:59:08,470 --> 04:59:17,689
action was correct but you did not follow the correct procedure that was right in your last

1328
04:59:17,689 --> 04:59:21,689
case your examination the abdomen revealed that the patient was experiencing pain on both sides of

1329
04:59:21,689 --> 04:59:27,349
the lower abdomen even though the appendix is on the right side some appendicitis patients will

1330
04:59:27,349 --> 04:59:34,069
experience pain on both sides during examination an x-ray is required how the fuck was i supposed

1331
04:59:34,069 --> 04:59:44,709
to know last door on the left they're all they'll have abdominal pain hey i got an idea why don't

1332
04:59:44,709 --> 04:59:51,560
we check the water that's the third person with the same acute abdominal pain in the last 10

1333
04:59:51,560 --> 05:00:26,310
minutes flu-like symptoms okay let's take a look no pain okay we've got no pain no pain at all

1334
05:00:26,310 --> 05:00:47,299
all right so no pain to touch which means you've got the flu medicaid your last case the examination

1335
05:00:47,299 --> 05:00:50,740
of the patient revealed that the patient was not suffering from acute abdominal pain further

1336
05:00:50,740 --> 05:00:55,779
observation of the patient is indicated as the usual cause of uh transient abdominal pain as an

1337
05:00:55,939 --> 05:01:12,490
intestinal gas abdominal pain okay patient suffering from abdominal pain accompanied by

1338

weakness and not dizziness i think we need an x right here so this is they're just really really

1382
05:12:13,979 --> 05:12:18,299
this is the kind of scenario that you would do to somebody when you know they fucked up with

1383
05:12:18,299 --> 05:12:30,729
the antibiotics before this symptom indicates the presence of a bacterial infection which should be

1408
05:18:56,630 --> 05:19:00,950
leave this much of the patient's body uncovered if it is not part of the operation use the drape

1409
05:19:00,950 --> 05:19:09,619
to cover the unaffected area you've got it is this the drape which one of these is drape this

1410

1416
05:21:10,139 --> 05:21:25,979
administered is because i put this shit all over it huh why that's a that's a very small area

1417
05:21:25,979 --> 05:21:37,580
do i have to that's what have we taken out what are we taking out it's a coin slot okay hold on

1418
05:21:37,580 --> 05:21:54,060
the patient's skin is not sterile hold on okay are we ready to go in don't hack up the sterile

1419
05:21:54,060 --> 05:22:11,900

1420
05:22:11,900 --> 05:22:15,580
it's skipping it automatically i'm not touching anything uh can somebody freeze frame that and

1421
05:22:15,580 --> 05:22:42,729
tell me what it said slow the game down okay uh who's calling me acute abdominal pain he said

1422
05:22:42,729 --> 05:22:49,540
there are procedures you have to follow before you're allowed to operate nausea cramping weakness

1423
05:22:49,540 --> 05:23:04,979
and dizziness all right so here we go pain on the left side pain on both sides okay so pain on

1424
05:23:04,979 --> 05:23:20,889
both sides is you check for the for kidney stones and then you refer kidney stones on both sides

1425
05:23:23,099 --> 05:23:32,200
i don't i'm not qualified for this so this is a referral to a to a urologist very nicely done

1426
05:23:32,200 --> 05:23:35,959
your diagnosis of kidney stones and your decision to refer to the patient will both correct

1427
05:23:37,479 --> 05:23:50,500
thank you very much room four abdominal pain weakness nausea and runny nose you might just

1741
06:48:33,299 --> 06:48:41,220
though that's my favorite emote this is by far my favorite emote on the site and i didn't do it for

1742
06:48:41,220 --> 06:48:48,740
five months i don't think anybody has one that can compare i don't think they do i'll stand

1743

06:49:03,459 --> 06:49:07,779

1746
06:49:08,259 --> 06:49:27,560
twitch but thank you lazy luke uh thank you chimera 87x for the 250 rick vitality is alex jones's

1747
06:49:27,560 --> 06:49:49,610
next supplement line rick vitality that guy was wild thank you to stiff funky chicken for the

1748
06:49:49,610 --> 06:49:56,709
three bucks uh i asked last night you this but i think you missed it if not disregard i was

1749
06:49:56,709 --> 06:50:00,549
wondering if you had thought about establishing a place for members to submit community art

1750
06:50:02,229 --> 06:50:09,349
yeah uh i'm not sure how much you've been around the last week or so but i'm going to start to do

1751
06:50:09,349 --> 06:50:14,950
community nights where instead of it just being we're gonna do artwork we're gonna do show a

1752
06:50:14,950 --> 06:50:22,389
couple of a video that somebody sent through we're gonna do uh hey somebody sent like a funny copy

1753
06:50:22,389 --> 06:50:29,369
pasta once every two or three weeks we're gonna just compile all of them and spend an hour or two

1754
06:50:29,369 --> 06:50:36,810
at least going through so it'll be like artwork videos random like little stories that people

1755
06:50:36,810 --> 06:50:45,430
write so and that's why i've not been uh i've been i don't really have a time frame for that

1756
06:50:46,310 --> 06:50:52,790
unfortunately because this carnival stream has taken up all of my other non-on stream time

1757
06:50:54,779 --> 06:51:00,299
when i'm not live on twitch besides like taking a day or two here just to kind of you know

1758
06:51:01,259 --> 06:51:07,959
to hang out with my girlfriend and you'd be like a person i've been doing this carnival shit

1759
06:51:08,919 --> 06:51:13,799
so i haven't put that much brain power into this yet and it really is probably not going to start

1760
06:51:13,799 --> 06:51:25,139
happening until the carnival stream is over so all time that is dedicated to like stream stuff

1761
06:51:25,139 --> 06:51:35,610
is split at this point evenly with the carnival and being like actually on stream but after the

1762
06:51:35,770 --> 06:51:42,439
21st i'm really gonna get that hammered out and have an actual set time for whenever we're gonna

1763
06:51:42,439 --> 06:51:47,659
do it i might even be able to do it it depends on how much work gets done uh this coming week

1764
06:51:50,569 --> 06:51:55,049
next week is when most of the real important details for this frame are gonna happen

1765
06:51:55,049 --> 06:52:01,049
because it's already been back and forth about contracts and what do we want how many robots

1766
06:52:01,049 --> 06:52:04,009
do you want how many things do you want to do do you want to have this do you want to have that

1767
06:52:04,009 --> 06:52:08,970
and this next week here is we're all going to be in the same room and really hash the whole thing

1823
07:01:38,950 --> 07:01:48,759
diego um yeah i i think maybe i don't know it's going to be really tough i have not decided if

1824
07:01:48,759 --> 07:01:54,759
i'm going to actually be at twitchcon or not and is for one very specific reason because

1825
07:01:56,340 --> 07:02:03,930
that carnival stream is on the 21st and i don't know how i might because i'm not going to be able

1826
07:02:03,930 --> 07:02:10,779
to stream i'm not going to be able to stream for almost a week before that stream happens

1827
07:02:11,659 --> 07:02:18,700
i will be in this facility getting everything set up and moving stuff and helping

1828
07:02:19,259 --> 07:02:24,220
set up sets and talking to people and telling people where i want things and i mean i'm going

1829
07:02:24,220 --> 07:02:31,259
to be there for probably like five days before 21st of september so i won't be live for a while

1830
07:02:31,259 --> 07:02:38,389
and then come back oh hey it's like the 23rd 24th and then what just stream like for a day or two

1831
07:02:38,389 --> 07:02:44,919
and then leave again for like four or five days you know what i'm saying i would only be live for

1832
07:02:44,919 --> 07:02:55,500
like two days out of like two and a half weeks and i don't know if i want to do that the idea is that

1833
07:02:55,500 --> 07:03:02,860
i would probably go for it a short duration because i really will only have like a day or two to kind

1834
07:03:02,860 --> 07:03:09,720
of get back to normal and then i'm leaving again to go to twitchcon so we'll see i may or may not

1835
07:03:09,720 --> 07:03:17,369
be there for like a day or two i've not 100 decided yet i do have a ticket though because

1836
07:03:17,369 --> 07:03:23,049
i made sure to get one to i have a twitchcon ticket so it's not like i'm going to be like

1837
07:03:23,049 --> 07:03:45,849
locked out or anything but uh maybe we'll see there'll be a clown car at this carnival stream

1838
07:03:46,490 --> 07:04:07,459
how would i not have clowns at a carnival you want to help advertise the carnival stream you

1839
07:04:07,459 --> 07:04:16,040
should put something about it on your offline screen yeah as we get closer there's going to

1840
07:04:16,040 --> 07:04:22,250
be a lot more i'll be talking about it a lot more and potentially even uh the companies that are

1841
07:04:22,250 --> 07:04:31,849
involved because i know that i'm gonna be you'll know who's behind a lot of this it's not just

1842
07:04:31,849 --> 07:04:40,220
gonna be the this nameless faceless company you'll know who's helped out a lot so we'll go i don't

1843
07:04:40,220 --> 07:04:48,540
have that information yet so but uh thank you for the 10 bucks bet three i'm not sure yet

1844
07:04:49,500 --> 07:04:54,459
creamy sensation thanks for the five dollars this is doom but a doom slayer went to heaven instead

1845
07:04:54,459 --> 07:05:07,270
of hell that was for the bible game i forgot about that game it's been a weird night huh

1846
07:05:09,849 --> 07:05:14,650
thank you to fuss roe for the five dollars germa i'm playing dark souls for the first time

1847
07:05:14,650 --> 07:05:22,099
what's the best build do you have any tips i'm i'm i'm sorry i might be the worst person to ask

1848
07:05:22,900 --> 07:05:39,319
the best weapon in dark souls remastered um doesn't isn't dark souls one have like a lot

1849
07:05:39,319 --> 07:05:56,470
of usable weapons you can pretty much use anything have you tried playing a good game instead

1850
07:05:56,470 --> 07:06:06,220
whoa hold on whoops they have uh hit the brakes on that one for a second playing a good i mean

1851
07:06:06,220 --> 07:06:13,099
yeah the first 12 out 15 hours of dark souls one is is incredible and then in the middle

1852
07:06:13,099 --> 07:06:20,939
like 10 hours is puke inducing and and awful and but then the last like 20 of the hours are

1853
07:06:20,939 --> 07:06:32,409
absolutely fantastic so a majority of that game is incredible so you can forget about the the middle

1854
07:06:32,409 --> 07:06:36,330
part this is just it's the fucking lettuce you can you can take the lettuce out if you want

1855
07:06:36,330 --> 07:06:55,400
just eat the burger dark souls is a 60 hour game yeah i mean all the souls born games your first

1856
07:06:55,400 --> 07:07:01,130
playthrough always takes like 30 to 50 hours because you have no idea what the hell you're

1857
07:07:01,130 --> 07:07:16,389
doing or where you're going the dark souls one is still a great game though it's still a really

1858
07:07:16,389 --> 07:07:32,090
really good game lettuce is unimportant on anything lettuce is kind of just crunchy water

1859
07:07:36,819 --> 07:07:44,169
but sometimes crunchy water is really important on some stuff uh thank you bananaism for the five

1860
07:07:44,169 --> 07:07:50,409
dollars and 90 cents they say chug chug chug i'm not sure what i was chugging at the time

1861
07:07:50,409 --> 07:08:03,099
well what you wanted me to chug but i didn't uh thank you to doctor uh dr enak for the 20

1862
07:08:03,099 --> 07:08:11,540
dollars 10 dollars twice in a row say i love ms dos nights i do too sometimes i get really really

1863
07:08:11,540 --> 07:08:18,169
overstimulated when we do this though because so many different colors and loud sounds and music

1864
07:08:18,169 --> 07:08:25,130
and weird fucked up shit and after like four to five hours six hours of doing dos i kind of just

1865
07:08:25,130 --> 07:08:34,180
like my brain turns to mush but i do love doing it it's so much fun just to see although it's

1866
07:08:34,180 --> 07:08:43,380
like you never know what you're gonna get it's a it's a box of chocolates and some of the chocolates

1867
07:08:43,380 --> 07:08:54,619
are filled with acid but thank you for the 20 bucks i really appreciate it uh flank tank

1868
07:08:54,619 --> 07:08:58,380
thanks for three bucks how much money would it take for you to scream on mixer full time

1869
07:08:59,580 --> 07:09:16,259
i've a look listen let me tell you something this is very very easy answer i i made the switch to

1870
07:09:16,819 --> 07:09:24,819
a different platform before right i went from youtube to twitch and i think it's probably taken

1871
07:09:26,389 --> 07:09:32,630
a couple years to really have everybody understand that i'm here i i made a switch

1872
07:09:33,689 --> 07:09:37,610
so going switching from youtube to twitch and then from twitch to another platform

1873
07:09:38,650 --> 07:09:44,009
i feel like that's like that's like the second platform switch i don't know if i have it in me

1874
07:09:44,009 --> 07:09:51,590
to do like another platform switch again now i mean i don't know if twitch for some reason

1875
07:09:52,150 --> 07:09:57,750
starts to really become like a company or as a company that i don't really want to be a part

1876
07:09:57,750 --> 07:10:01,590
of and i'd rather try something else i mean that that'll that conversation will happen with myself

1877
07:10:02,950 --> 07:10:18,139
what i do for millions of dollars i mean that's like that but that's like saying yes i probably

1878
07:10:18,139 --> 07:10:23,799
would because that's that's like you want to be like no i wouldn't do that how dare they even

1879
07:10:23,799 --> 07:10:27,880
have decided you know what i could do with a million dollars you know what i could do with

1880
07:10:27,880 --> 07:10:45,799
two fucking million dollars i i would make a goddamn movie i would i would do it would be all

1881
07:10:45,799 --> 07:10:58,459
kinds of crazy shit that i would do on those streams but no i mean i'd be lying to you guys if

1882
07:10:58,459 --> 07:11:02,779
i and i and i think a majority of people would probably be lying to you if it was like hey would

1883
07:11:02,779 --> 07:11:09,419
you like switch over for like a million dollars no no i don't think so i don't believe so i would

1884
07:11:09,419 --> 07:11:17,349
probably continue to stay here i don't know i yes that's like literally life-changing fucking never

1885
07:11:17,349 --> 07:11:23,509
have to work again a day in your life money yeah obviously like you're gonna do it if it's just if

1886
07:11:23,509 --> 07:11:32,310
yeah well maybe not everybody would do it for various reasons but two or three million dollars

1887
07:11:32,310 --> 07:11:48,970
is like that you that's every cent you'd ever need until until you were buried i'd burn through

1888
07:11:48,970 --> 07:12:00,279
that money quick no i wouldn't i would not i would do the thing where i would hide okay for if i got

1889
07:12:00,279 --> 07:12:05,080
if i came into like a million couple million dollars like tomorrow right the first thing i

1890
07:12:05,080 --> 07:12:11,479
would do i would hire a lawyer i would get a really really good lawyer and i would say i want you to

1891
07:12:11,479 --> 07:12:17,400
make a contract that i have to sign to dump my money into like a vault that i cannot open

1892
07:12:18,360 --> 07:12:23,720
you know what i'm saying like i want you to i want to put a million dollars into a vault

1893
07:12:23,720 --> 07:12:28,360
that i'm not allowed to touch like retirement account type shit just put it into a big safe

1894
07:12:28,360 --> 07:12:32,419
and don't give me the combination but you don't get to have it though like he's like okay i'll

1895
07:12:32,419 --> 07:12:37,540

1896
07:12:37,540 --> 07:12:53,880

07:13:54,970 --> 07:14:00,939
bored i would be like oh this is fucking great and after like fucking three years i'd be like

1906
07:14:00,939 --> 07:14:17,639
i need to do something i can't stream anymore i can't like make a video i'd go nuts three years

1907
07:14:17,639 --> 07:14:23,849
is generous it would probably yeah that is it would take like probably two weeks no it would

1908
07:14:23,849 --> 07:14:37,610
be more than that it'd be like a after like two or three months but i i was always under the

1909
07:14:37,610 --> 07:14:43,770
impression that i was going to do this until i didn't think it was interesting or fun anymore

1910
07:14:45,380 --> 07:14:50,979
and if that hasn't happened yet then i will never no matter like oh yeah give me 10 million dollars

1911
07:14:50,979 --> 07:14:57,659
and stop streaming forever i i do i am not satisfied yet and if i'm not completely satisfied

1912
07:14:57,659 --> 07:15:11,349

jerma i'll give you a million dollars if you stop to keep streaming until it stops being fun

1914
07:15:24,840 --> 07:15:28,439
the only way that i would actually accept a million dollars from anybody that was

1915
07:15:28,439 --> 07:15:33,880
somebody that was watching the channel was if you could prove somehow i would you would have

to go through like an underwriter to prove that you have like a hundred million dollars

1917
07:15:37,959 --> 07:15:44,520
as the only way i'd ever to ever accept that you'd have to go through like like a mortgage

company to prove that you can like do that like a thousand times over no not the undertaker an

night take care and goodbye get some sleep we got one more bit that came in at one more right now

2024
07:36:08,599 --> 07:36:13,240
by snoozing copter 250 from snoozing copter they say hey germo uh when you don't know where you

2025
07:36:13,240 --> 07:36:17,799
want to be or where you want to go what do you do except for waiting it out i'm sure you and uh

2026
07:36:17,799 --> 07:36:24,490
and everyone can relate i want to hear your thoughts when you don't know where you want

2027
07:36:24,490 --> 07:36:33,770
to be or where you want to go i think well for me at least uh in regards to where i wanted to be

2028
07:36:36,330 --> 07:36:41,770
i kind of just wanted to be somewhere that i knew i was gonna wake up every day and

2029
07:36:43,209 --> 07:36:50,459
be at least interested in where i was and what i was doing at least in a territorial sense

2030
07:36:51,020 --> 07:36:57,930
but in a more elaborate sense of where you want to be a way you want to go i always was of the

2031
07:36:57,930 --> 07:37:07,990
mindset that you you kind of pick a few things that you like and try to have one of them or

2032
07:37:07,990 --> 07:37:13,400
a combination of them work out find what you're interested in find at least two or three things

2033
07:37:13,400 --> 07:37:19,000
that you really are interested in and be happy with any of those things i think a lot of times

2034
07:37:20,279 --> 07:37:24,840
i think a lot of times people can get stuck by putting all their eggs in one basket

2035
07:37:25,560 --> 07:37:30,759
when you should have a few baskets that you are equally excited about and as long as one of them

2036
07:37:30,759 --> 07:37:42,779
works out then you're happy trying to find what you're interested in and then spread out the eggs

2037
07:37:42,779 --> 07:37:57,750
a little get into the carnival business now but it's tough because it's it's tough because

2038
07:37:57,750 --> 07:38:04,069
everybody is interested in different things but i'll tell you just i wanted to do entertainment i

2039
07:38:04,069 --> 07:38:10,869
wanted to be like an entertainer actor comedian whatever that was one of but also i wanted to work

2040
07:38:10,869 --> 07:38:18,619
with animals i was really really into the idea of getting into i like love dogs i love cat love

2041
07:38:18,619 --> 07:38:25,340
animals right so that was another i'm really into that another one was doing uh customer service

2042
07:38:25,340 --> 07:38:31,419
like i like talking to people i'm the big i'm big into having conversations so with customer

2043
07:38:31,419 --> 07:38:38,139
service uh field customer not necessarily support but so any of those three things i

2044
07:38:38,139 --> 07:38:43,180
was going to be happy with because i was actually really interested in all three of them if i had

2045
07:38:43,180 --> 07:38:51,349
been let's say for instance i never did anything on twitch or youtube and instead i fell into

2046
07:38:51,349 --> 07:38:59,029
like a uh like a vet clinic right i would be very happy if i was like a vet tech or

2047
07:38:59,029 --> 07:39:03,750
somebody that worked in the veterinary field right

2048
07:39:09,540 --> 07:39:16,020
or combine them you know find a few things that you like to do and be happy doing any of them

2049
07:39:16,020 --> 07:39:43,290
comedian for pets combine them all be a clown vet but that is honestly the only advice i can really

2050
07:39:43,290 --> 07:39:49,700
give i've been very fortunate to do something and sort of fall into and do something that i really

2051
07:39:49,700 --> 07:39:56,180
really really wanted to do but i was really really happy and passionate about very very fortunate

2052
07:39:56,180 --> 07:40:03,610
to be able to do that but i was prepared to fall back on one of those other couple things

2053
07:40:07,849 --> 07:40:15,880
and that's pretty much that's pretty much what i gotta say i wish you luck i wish you the best

2054
07:40:18,869 --> 07:40:30,279
sometimes you need a change of scenery sometimes you do moving and even if you even change in towns

2055
07:40:30,919 --> 07:40:35,560
or you know going a few miles away if you've been in the same place for a while

2056
07:40:37,380 --> 07:40:48,819
it can help but with that i will see you all tomorrow have a great rest of your night

2057
07:40:49,380 --> 07:40:53,500
get some sleep see you tomorrow good night
