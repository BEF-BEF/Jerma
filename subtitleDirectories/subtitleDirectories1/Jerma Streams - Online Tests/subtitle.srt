1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:09,839
I wasn't late. I wasn't late. I started it at two o'clock, sir. It was two two p.m. And

2
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:21,399
42 seconds or something. He said on the dot right at two two zero zero. It was gonna start

3
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:33,920
I didn't count any seconds after that so somebody wrote losing interest. Yeah, I already lost interest in this shit

4
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,609
I don't care anymore

5
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,679
No more quizzes, dude. I've seen enough

6
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:54,450
Where's chubby bunny for chubby bunny? Hmm interesting concept for a an activity

7
00:00:54,450 --> 00:01:06,000
I will do chubby bunny today. Yes, it's gonna happen today. That's right. But when is it going to happen?

8
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:16,590
We're gonna pull some American reality TV on you guys. I'm gonna talk about the thing that you care about

9
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,670
25 times over the next few hours and coming up soon

10
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:27,129
Chubby bunny with germa and it shows me in like this weird cube

11
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:33,390
There's a glass around it for some reason and there's cameras all over this one like bird's-eye camera and I'm sitting there like

12
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:43,900
Shit after the break and then the break comes back and they don't go to me doing chubby bunny

13
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,659
They do something else entirely but like two more hours

14
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:55,109
They do three or four more commercial breaks in that time where they show me with goggles on inside the cage inside of the glass box

15
00:01:55,109 --> 00:02:03,560
Here he comes and don't forget chubby bunny coming up with germa. I look into the camera. I'm like, yo, hey you oh

16
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:08,439
And then it happens right before the credits roll and it sucks

17
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:21,590
Prepare yourself. It's a way to keep you here till I'm done. That's the g4. I

18
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:24,090
Don't remember

19
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:32,949
But stalling this this whole stream is a stall. Don't you understand? I have 30 plus personality quizzes and

20
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:39,460
Tests and then we're gonna play a family feud online video game

21
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,599
And we have by the way you get to participate in what's that? Oh, can you believe that?

22
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,900

23
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:55,840
Thanks for the five thousand bits phylactery. It's huge amount of money. Put the marshmallows in your mouth before we fucking lose it

24
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,639
You'll see it. Hey, it's going to happen before the stream turns off

25
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:11,340
I guarantee it and everybody thinks I'm gonna like die or something. I'm not gonna look

26
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:18,409
Let me just be very very clear I am NOT going to do chubby bunny until I die

27
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:26,580
I know a lot of people are saying dude, don't be careful. I don't care about getting the world record at chubby bunny

28
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:32,620
I don't care. It's a stupid activity. No one should ever fucking do it under any circumstance ever

29
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:35,939
I'm just gonna do it. I'm gonna do it for the photo

30
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,439
You know, I'll get some in there and be like

31
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:48,500
And then it all comes out no one has done this in five years

32
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:56,860
Yeah, and no one should ever do it full disclaimer. Don't do chubby bunny. It's fucking stupid. It's it's not even fun

33
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:02,550
It sucks. It's not even funny. I just said it and I said it out loud

34
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,389
I said I was gonna do it because it was just a thing that I thought I was never gonna have to do

35
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:07,789
But here we are

36
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:14,500
Why are you doing it then because I have to I made a promise on the Mafia remake stream

37
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:18,740
That if I took damage on that one mission that I was gonna have to do it

38
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:24,660
So I'm just taking it for the fucking photo. Okay, but chug stream

Stalling stalling. I'm naughty. I'm just hanging out for a sec on my intro screen

48
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,750
We've gone over this before we talked about this a thousand times

49
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:39,079
How many streamers do you know that they're starting soon screen is like 40 minutes when I turn that on um, I'm here in the seat

50
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:41,509

51
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,389
Actively stall not passively stall you see I'm an active staller

52
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:53,339

That's the playlist and I have 30 plus quizzes. We're gonna start right now. How do we transition over there?

58
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:34,180
Can you see it? I mean wait, I have to hide this I don't want anyone to know what I'm doing

59
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,660
And hide the tabs first

60
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:46,629
Always job. We start the music. Oh, no, he showed his stream key. Oh

I'm gonna get this out of the way because I know I'm gonna I'm gonna drink out of this can

00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:08,050
And it's gonna piss off a ton of people. I gotta get this out of the way

66
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:13,040
I have no affiliation with whatever this is I have no feel it

67
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,439
I just know that I'm gonna take a sip out of it and somebody's gonna say you'll fuck you

68
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:41,920
Okay, I know look I get it. It was on sale. Okay, it was on sale. This is why I don't put face cam on

You get it. It's disgusting. I didn't say that you did

75
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:29,480
Alright, let's do it. We're gonna do a review right now. This is the mango one

76
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,799
It's probably because why I was on sale probably not a high top seller

77
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:53,029
I kind of tastes like the air inside of an airplane. I think it's like airplane air

78
00:08:53,629 --> 00:09:04,600
like texture it tastes like

79
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:12,440
Okay, you know when you when you when you have a Jolly Rancher and you get to the very end of the Jolly Rancher

80
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,419
And it's finally gone

81
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,389
Okay an hour later

82
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:22,549
Like the the spit and taste inside of your mouth if you have not had any more food after that that like you're like

83
00:09:22,549 --> 00:09:32,450
Owned flavoring inside your mouth. You're like you're like coating. It's like that. It's not bad. It's only two

84
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:40,000
I can't like what I am I gonna have ten of these

85
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:47,120
This is the first time I've drank alcohol like seven months. No, this is the third time

86
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:56,360
I've drank alcohol and since February where the fuck am I going? I ain't going anywhere. Where do I have to go?

87
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,799
I'm not going anywhere. I can't have I can't have a fucking

88
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:02,519
airplane air quality

89
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:25,500
Drink I can't have one in seven months, you know, all right, like I kind of feel like all right

90
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:32,090
So this feels like I should have like I contact somebody. Hey

91
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:35,580
There it is

92
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:42,830
German that a five's drink of choice. It's not this it's not this

93
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:46,960
But he'll drink it if he had if he wants to if he thinks it's pretty it's okay

94
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:57,360
It's pretty good. I don't I think it's okay. I think it's okay. Don't drink it. All right

95
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,220
We're gonna start with my mental age. This is the these are all there's like we gotta go. There's like 40 of these

96
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:09,879
Thank you, Nidhogg for the five community subs. I had to get that out of the way

97
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:11,080
I know people are gonna freak the fuck out

98
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:16,980
Like if I didn't say anything about this and you saw that lettering you'd be like fuck this guy

99
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:23,200
Now I give you like a 15 minute excuse as to why I'm drinking in the first place. You have one. Okay, let's start

100
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:30,970
This determines how old I am mentally I guess okay my question one of 20

101
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:39,720
The whole page is an ad. Okay, Twitter is

102
00:11:40,799 --> 00:12:01,360
Confusing get that book. I don't get that out of here. Oh the music that's better. Okay, Twitter is confusing essential pointless

103
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:13,980
Annoying it wakes me up in the morning. It's fucking pointless. You find an old shirt in the wardrobe you

104
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:24,970
Can't believe you ever wore that and throw it up you keep it for decorating you consider giving it to charity

105
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:32,000
You put it on you wonder how you ever managed to fit in it. Well, what's a wardrobe give charity?

106
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,259
I would have given it to charity well before this

107
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,450
Anytime I get new clothes. I usually do it like a charity thing. It's like, okay. What do I wear?

108
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:54,379
Do I wear that? I don't charity the don't wear pie go pile goes charity. Sure. You're planning a house party you

109
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:57,190
Bring the white claw

110
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:00,440
Think about telling your neighbors. Make sure you got enough chairs

111
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,539
Find out where the cheapest vodka is plan which games to play

112
00:13:05,539 --> 00:13:14,399
I would not invite my neighbors to a party. That's that's mental age of like 80

113
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:21,049
Nobody talks to their neighbors anymore back in like the day. It was always like oh you need some sugar

114
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:27,289
Hey, it's me Dave from right next door. I'm knocking on your fucking door. Hey, can I have stuff that doesn't happen anymore?

115
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:36,309
I would not invite a neighbor to a party. In fact, if my neighbor knocked on my door, I'd be like it get away from me

116
00:13:36,309 --> 00:13:40,080
I don't know who you are. Believe me alone. And then I would

117
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,559
Slam the big slider shut you're not getting into Oz

118
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:52,120
What's the question? I would make sure I had a no, that's gross

119
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:58,809
You're gonna serve the gross shit to your friends the cheap shit to your friends. I've got a better idea

120
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:10,659
You should serve them high quality red wine like a mile like a mile back

121
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,320
Not this you drink this in your house. Nobody knows you're there

122
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:25,169
I would make sure I had enough chairs people to sit down baseball caps look better forwards

123
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:32,090
I like where I don't like wearing the cap backwards kind of hurts my head. It's hot. You want an ice cream you buy

124
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:39,529
It's hot. You want an ice cream you buy a Magnum

125
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:44,139
I would you buy a Magnum if you wanted to have an ice cream

126
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:53,289
What I don't how does this game work? I would buy a cone with a chocolate flake

127
00:14:53,490 --> 00:15:02,940
These feel like AI is this AI generated? I buy a chocolate ice cream. I don't know whatever the fuck that is

128
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,120
McDonald's is a good place to meet. Oh, I fucking am mad about this

129
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,700
Righty then

130
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:21,990
That's the only thing I can think of when I hear this song a sprinter or two

131
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:29,690
I can never enjoy this halo theme song. Okay, a good place to meet McDonald's is okay for a quick snack

132
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:37,789
Yeah, it's not disgusting. Please the current prime minister president looks too young

133
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:39,509
No

134
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:40,629
Okay

135
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:49,240
They're all old. They're all these he's like 75. He's old. He's not even a prime minister

136
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,779
This is a UK question. You think a you think a pension plan is

137
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:59,759
Not what you thought it would be important or something worth considering something for later

138
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:08,139
I feel like these are all the same answer. I feel like that's like something to consider

139
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,320
Life is fun

140
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,120
Sure, it sure is you get passed on the motorway by a Ferrari like

141
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:25,419
How fast you think sweet I bet that driver is a wanker they'll not get there any quicker

142
00:16:52,460 --> 00:17:07,230
Where's Avenger, how come Avengers not on here?

143
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:39,099
Mr. Green, oh you revealed it. Okay, you have forgotten where you put your keys. This happens all the time

144
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:43,539
Hey, let me distract you with a fucking way to bring you all together

145
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:48,700
Hey, let me let me bring you all together, right? Oh, it just said like conservative

146
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:58,539
It said liberal fucking Republican Democrat. Let me bring you all together. God. I love this shit so much. I love it

147
00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:01,079
Oh, what do you think about that guys collectively?

148
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:11,000
Get out of here. This is my favorite drink

149
00:18:13,869 --> 00:18:19,059

Like I wish like the waiter or waitress when you were done at your meal

165
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,339

Okay, I'd probably be like hey you good. Okay, the best thing on TV is the big bang theory

203
00:23:43,609 --> 00:23:49,089

00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:55,710

00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:17,319
Probably like yeah, it's not

210
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:22,309
Probably moving on to do other things

211
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:23,509
24

212
00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:27,000
like hey

213
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,990
24 this highly accurate age test has looked at your answers and evaluated that you mental age is 24

214
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:38,200
The test looks at your answer to the questions in relation to your attitude towards social and financial situations

215
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:40,319
These were just like mean questions

216
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,279
It's quite possible that you will not be happy with your age test result of your younger

217
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,279
You probably don't want to have an age that makes you look older

218
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:50,400
If you are older than you don't want to have a mental age of a youngster

219
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:56,319
Such unfortunately is life you have to roll with the person you are and accept your personality

220
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,480
Some interesting stats for those that are interested in these things

221
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:02,960
68% of people that take this test have a mental age of less than 30

222
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:12,839
This might be that 68% of people that take the test are less than 30, but it's very high age average here at MMA

223
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:18,690
We think it's more likely that people have a youthful attitude in life, but that's not jump child

224
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:24,460
Okay, if you can like if you can order drinks at a bar

225
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:32,519
Three times over you that's that's three times over you can order drinks at a bar

226
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:44,559
Yeah, that means like 21 22 23 24. I don't matter no more

227
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:51,509
You just do what you just hang out people get grumpier as they get older

228
00:25:52,029 --> 00:26:00,029
Kind of kind of all right. That's my mental age is 24. Okay, cool. What's the next one?

229
00:26:00,269 --> 00:26:01,490
All right

230
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:05,809
This I this is like a test to see if I have like a color imbalance or something in my brain

231
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:11,559
All right, this is the color challenge. I get the first and last color chips are fixed

232
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:22,339
Okay, drag and drop the colors in each row to arrange them by hue color complete all four color tests my color IQ

233
00:26:22,339 --> 00:26:27,960
All right, sure. So I just in shade I could do this

234
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:34,279
I pretty got a pretty pretty good eye. We're going pink to orange

235
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,440
Nobody say anything yet. I haven't done it yet

236
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,660
Negative IQ

237
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:52,799
We're going pink to orange. That's not that's green. I already took the Myers-Briggs personality test

238
00:26:52,799 --> 00:27:08,799
I got ENFP like ten years ago. I did it on stream too, didn't I? All right. I'm not done. No, that's not right

239
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:41,720
I think that's it. Do it. All right, that one's good. So we're going green to blue. This is really not this is not hard

240
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:54,799
Why is this so hard? But people can't do what is this difficult? This is met bad monitor

241
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:08,269
Do I have a shitty monitor actually gets a little harder on this next one? All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait

242
00:28:08,349 --> 00:28:30,109
That's close. But wait, this one's kind of freaking me out. I don't like this one. Is this that's wrong, isn't it?

243
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:44,039
I got it. That's right. No, it's not. All right, that one's correct. This is blue to purple

244
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:50,759
All right, we're gonna go shit because the ones on the left or right are fixed

245
00:28:50,759 --> 00:29:00,049
I can't move them eyes of a 24 year old the white balance of my cameras. We're gonna fucked up. Okay, that's the real

246
00:29:00,089 --> 00:29:23,440
That's the real color imbalance here. Hold on. Okay there you look pink

247
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:39,000
Let me just hold my face up there. Come on, bro. I'm hold on. All right, that's this is close enough

248
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:47,180
I don't even care if I get this wrong. I don't care what I can't I can't put like good colored cubes together

249
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:55,289
Who cares? I can do this some other time. No, it's gonna be this would be accurate

250
00:29:55,289 --> 00:30:07,319
All right purple back here. Do it by go left to right. That's done, right? Yeah, that was easy

251
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:20,200
All right, this one's gonna be the hard one. Oh, you're giving that much money. Let's get 50 community subs ready dread with the 50 subs

252
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:26,920
He shit. That's a lot of fucking money Freddy dread a resident billionaire

253
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:42,460
Gives like three thousand dollars to this for him every few months maniac. Hey, here's to that that's that's huge amount of money

254
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:50,589
Thank you. All right, let me finish this. I'm almost there

255
00:30:51,069 --> 00:31:04,509
Done why does that look wrong? But it looks wrong though. It's not. All right, I'm done score my test to

256
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:08,109
Okay, that scared me. I thought that was very bad

257
00:31:08,349 --> 00:31:14,569
Lower score is better with zero being a perfect score the circle graph displays the regions of the color spectrum where your hue

258
00:31:14,769 --> 00:31:23,670
Discrimination is low. What does that mean? I can't differentiate like blues

259
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:32,410
Means I suck at blue. So what's the height? What's the high end there compare age?

260
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:46,900
That score for your gender is nine nine nine nine what score worst score a hundred and six what somebody just put it

261
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:59,529
How do I read this? I don't know how to read that. I don't know what this data is telling me act

262
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,460
Okay, that's my color hue

263
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:13,599
70 IQ don't worry. All right next I

264
00:32:14,539 --> 00:32:19,099
Was told to do these this is a human benchmarking

265
00:32:19,539 --> 00:32:27,200
All right, let's do this one. I don't know what this means classic coming up

266
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:34,130
Are you smarter than a chimpanzee click the squares in order according to their numbers the test will get progressively harder

267
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:38,029
Am I smarter than a chimpanzee?

268
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:44,220
The squares in order according to their numbers one, two, three four

269
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,779
Okay, how does this get hot? Why does it get harder?

270
00:32:48,420 --> 00:33:12,940
One. Oh fuck. I didn't know that's what happened. Okay, I got a one two, three four chimpanzees done at it

271
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:20,039
But chimpanzee lost his round two

272
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:29,500
Oh

273
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:43,619
One two three four five six seven eight nine one two three four five one two three four five

274
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:59,460
One two three four five six seven eight nine one two three four five

275
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:18,659
Fucking Mario the backer turn. Okay, the Super Mario song is fucking me up get the fuck out of here

276
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:46,329
All right. What's what's the score then? What did I get save the score? What does that mean?

277
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:56,179
Percentile what does 17 percentile mean? Does that mean that I'm like really smart?

278
00:34:56,699 --> 00:35:06,380
Only 17 percent of people got as far as I did. That's pretty that's top 17 percent. That's pretty good. What's wrong with that?

279
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:16,699
Okay, aim trainer hit 30 targets as quickly as you can click the targets above to begin

280
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:37,170
This is messing with my concentration. It's like showing the colors and stuff. Okay, just shoot the targets. You tell my DPI is wrong

281
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:54,619
520 milliseconds, let's see. I'm better than I'm better than 70% of all gamers. That's bad. How is that bad?

282
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:59,960
That's bad. Okay, you know who takes this these quizzes like you guys

283
00:36:00,619 --> 00:36:12,860
Who takes these tests besides like gamers and computer enthusiasts? My parents didn't take this. It's bottom 30%

284
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:45,469
You're looking at it wrong. You're reading it wrong. That means I'm in the bottom 30 percentile. It's because I don't care about Facebook

285
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:52,659
Anyways

286
00:36:52,659 --> 00:36:55,860
Hearing oh, I got to turn my volume up for this one. I got good ears

287
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:02,329
You know, I have such good ears because I never have loud sounds in my head ever. I don't listen to music

288
00:37:02,329 --> 00:37:04,250
I don't go to concerts

289
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:09,650
I don't talk very loudly unless I'm in an environment where I'm a twitch.tv slash German 985 live streamer

290
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:13,610
I'm gonna get this one pretty good. Trust me. I have like weird superhuman fucking hearing

291
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:18,679
I swear to God I'm turning volume up for this one. I'm gonna be in like the top 90%

292
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:24,610
I swear to God trust me you want to see I'll prove that the gamer work went away. Look at that

293
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:34,849
There's just a little bit of some scar tissue. It'll heal over nicely. It's gone. Okay. This is what is this?

294
00:37:34,849 --> 00:37:42,190

To open the door in the hope of earning a copper

304
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,460
Needed a little minutes warm up there

00:39:49,460 --> 00:40:01,170
okay, but was it elbowed away by another loafer who had rushed up with the same intention a

528
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:47,319

01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:50,939
Folks

750
01:42:50,939 --> 01:43:04,869
Sore the seagull I get to be a seagull. How is that?

751
01:43:04,869 --> 01:43:15,550
Not the most pog moment of the whole year sure. Okay. Hold on. I almost

752
01:43:16,270 --> 01:43:26,670
Stop with the fucking engagement. I almost was the snake wait. Oh, no, this is what people were

753
01:43:32,359 --> 01:43:37,289
Caw-caw. Oh, why did I just say that out loud which horse?

756
01:43:59,710 --> 01:44:10,489
What historical figure do you admire? Um, I don't know the warrior queen

757
01:44:11,050 --> 01:44:13,739
Which of these living figures do you admire?

758
01:44:15,220 --> 01:44:22,460
It's Sean White on here. Wait Sean with the snowboarder

759
01:44:22,619 --> 01:44:43,220
You know why I admire Sean White the most cuz he got on this list somehow you enjoy reading. Yeah

760
01:44:43,220 --> 01:44:50,210
Oh, well, do you cook I call for takeout? It's the weekend. What's what's first on your Saturday agenda?

761
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:54,340
sleeping in

762
01:44:54,340 --> 01:44:58,140
What's your approach to fashion? I spend money on good clothes, but I don't have a signature look

763
01:44:58,140 --> 01:45:04,010
I like clothes that are durable and comfortable. Yep. What genre of music do you enjoy most?

764
01:45:09,859 --> 01:45:15,500
Classical no, that's not even right. I can't change my answer. That's not even right. Why did I know old-fashioned rock-and-roll?

765
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:20,779
I changed my answer opera. I don't give a shit about opera. Why would I click that?

766
01:45:20,779 --> 01:45:24,729
Oh, no, wait, that's not that's not a pretty rude

767
01:45:24,729 --> 01:45:29,489
I know what I meant to say was I don't like listen to opera not that I don't care

768
01:45:29,529 --> 01:45:32,890
It's a very very hard thing to do. It's like pretty talented people do opera

769
01:45:32,970 --> 01:45:43,100
Which of these would you like most for breakfast eggs bacon took? Yeah

770
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:49,850
Oh, yeah, what kind of home suits you best a townhouse a simple house a wired one with everything controlled from my phone

771
01:45:50,210 --> 01:45:53,819
That's terrifying. I don't want that. I want the thing that's complete

772
01:45:53,819 --> 01:45:59,699
I want the fucking cottage that has no electricity and you shit in a fucking bathtub 40 feet behind the back door

773
01:45:59,699 --> 01:46:06,199
I don't want that studio. I could clean with a hose. Okay, that's pretty good

774
01:46:06,199 --> 01:46:13,970
Which of these would you most likely choose as a hobby? I already did that so we'll do that one

775
01:46:14,069 --> 01:46:25,359
What's your idea of a good first date? This one is like I would just pretend to know what I was doing

776
01:46:25,359 --> 01:46:36,670
This is the real one. This is the one that I'm pretending. Yeah, I brought I brought you here and I'm very very smart

777
01:46:36,829 --> 01:47:03,359
No, it'd be bowling in like a couple of beers or something. What's a good age to get married? Oh, I did it

778
01:47:03,359 --> 01:47:10,199
I clicked it. How many children do you have or want? I didn't know I can't I can't even tie my shoes correctly

779
01:47:10,199 --> 01:47:16,899
I can't raise another human. Are you close to your family? Definitely. Which of these movie genres do you like the most?

780
01:47:17,300 --> 01:47:24,909
Comedy, how do you feel about marijuana? Let me tell you CBD THC

781
01:47:25,270 --> 01:47:33,710
Pretty much changed my fucking life. I started taking for medical reasons marijuana and I had a lot of pain problems and

782
01:47:34,390 --> 01:47:36,390
Just giving you some anecdotal

783
01:47:36,630 --> 01:47:39,880
Evidence felt a little better. Not too much

784
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:44,239
Don't do don't be a fucking psycho if it's legal in your area and you can maybe try it

785
01:47:44,239 --> 01:47:48,760
It's illegal and you're not breaking any fucking rules. Don't do anything stupid. Maybe in a safe environment

786
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:53,670
I did a lot for me. Actually, I would can I I would testify

787
01:47:54,130 --> 01:47:56,500
It's kind of smelly and low rent

788
01:47:56,779 --> 01:48:11,680
What he means low rent it means low rent, how do I delete that? Okay

789
01:48:12,079 --> 01:48:14,619
if you say this

790
01:48:14,619 --> 01:48:18,060
why do I feel like you smoke like cigarettes like two packs a day and

791
01:48:18,579 --> 01:48:29,770
Like you like coke is in your fridge more than the actual drink you get a gift card

792
01:48:29,770 --> 01:48:33,689
This is a how fucking detailed is this to determine what kind of a horse I am

793
01:48:34,130 --> 01:48:42,029
What with this one? I have a halfway what kind of why is it so detailed?

794
01:48:42,550 --> 01:48:47,279
Just this better be accurate. You get a gift card to a well-stocked shoe shop. What do you buy?

795
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:59,279
Comfortable. Oh, no, I've been comfortable. You've had a fight with your significant other. How do you resolve it? Sounds dull

796
01:48:59,279 --> 01:49:04,960
But it's usually talking out a brood for a while. They've got to apologize. I know it's arrogant

797
01:49:08,149 --> 01:49:09,710
makeup sex

798
01:49:09,710 --> 01:49:15,840
What okay?

799
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:20,750
Listen, what does this have to do with a horse?

800
01:49:21,350 --> 01:49:28,460
Horses don't talk to each other horses don't like have breakups and then makeup sex

801
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:35,930
Like horses don't like have like that. It's not like there's no what arguments

802
01:49:36,390 --> 01:49:43,840
Would you have sex on the first date? Oh god. This is some weird fucking data mine

803
01:49:45,300 --> 01:49:55,720
To be honest I have but I tell my kids not to I'm such a hypocrite

804
01:49:56,239 --> 01:50:18,079
I'm sorry. No, not on the first date. Come on

805
01:50:18,079 --> 01:50:31,979
It's gonna take me a few dates to find out if if you like don't want to take like a vaccine

806
01:50:32,100 --> 01:50:37,439
You know, I mean, it's gonna take me a few days for you to be like, oh and by the way

807
01:50:37,439 --> 01:50:40,720
Uh, it's like I think that I think that we're all aliens. Oh

808
01:50:43,880 --> 01:50:46,270
eight number two

809
01:50:46,270 --> 01:50:48,699
We had sex two days ago

810
01:50:50,460 --> 01:50:52,460
This person thinks that we're aliens

811
01:50:54,859 --> 01:50:56,859
Now you want to come back over

812
01:51:07,489 --> 01:51:09,649
Listen to me some of you might be in your day

813
01:51:09,649 --> 01:51:13,699
Some of you guys might be in the age we'd be dating you're talking to people give it a little bit of time

814
01:51:13,699 --> 01:51:19,600
Don't trust me at least a few dates at least a couple of weeks

815
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:24,710
Then you'll figure that out after like maybe a few weeks and this is a banger

816
01:51:25,350 --> 01:51:37,260
Don't die. It's absurd. Be careful. Be careful

817
01:51:38,140 --> 01:51:51,000
What kind of pet appeals to you dog at what point in our marriage?

818
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:55,399
Is it best to get a divorce? What the fuck does this have to do with the horses?

819
01:51:56,560 --> 01:52:08,239
What does this have to do with what does this have to do with horses when it's hurting the kids?

820
01:52:08,239 --> 01:52:19,489
I mean if you like if you're just not happy anymore and like I don't know when it's

821
01:52:20,050 --> 01:52:23,529
If you can work it if you can make it work for the sake of the family

822
01:52:23,529 --> 01:52:26,170
Maybe I don't know but like if you don't you don't make yourself suffer

823
01:52:27,090 --> 01:52:34,520
Well on a day of the company picnic you can usually be found anchoring the winning team in a tug-of-war

824
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:36,680
I'm at home. I don't want to go

825
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:43,319
No, how important is sex to you? Mr. Oh, mr. Horse

826
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:50,159
Wait horses fuck all the time. Okay horses fuck more than rabbits. I guess that makes sense

827
01:52:51,039 --> 01:52:53,159
How important sex?

828
01:52:53,159 --> 01:53:07,149
Why is there an answer every time about like being a degenerate and lying about it?

829
01:53:07,710 --> 01:53:21,960
What horse is like fucking and lying to all their horse friends? I don't understand. I keep up a good front

830
01:53:26,149 --> 01:53:32,189
It's it's good. It's great. But like don't don't make a fool out of yourself. Don't fucking just if it's yeah

831
01:53:32,189 --> 01:53:35,510
Don't make a fool out of yourself. What are you gonna? I want to have sex you just relax

832
01:53:35,750 --> 01:53:53,060
Which of these cars would you prefer? None of them. Where's a Honda Civic? I don't want any of these in the hearts

833
01:53:54,619 --> 01:53:56,859
Done done done

834
01:53:57,420 --> 01:54:00,899
That's not what is this? This is legend of this breath of the wild

835
01:54:01,460 --> 01:54:08,029
If I had to pick one of these would be a Tesla and I know like who he wants to just look I didn't say

836
01:54:08,029 --> 01:54:10,029
That I said if I had to choose

837
01:54:11,350 --> 01:54:19,560
Big I don't want to die in a motorcycle. It's fucking you get you. It's horrible. Yeah, I don't like that

838
01:54:19,560 --> 01:54:23,279
I don't I want to I want to be safe. This is too big and I don't know what that is

839
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:36,149
Which of these popular writers books might you choose for a long plane ride? I don't

840
01:54:36,829 --> 01:54:47,819
Don't want to read that. I've already seen the movie. I don't know who these other authors are

841
01:54:48,300 --> 01:54:52,920
We're gonna go with Tim

842
01:54:52,920 --> 01:54:59,800
If a book is too heavy to lug around airports and planes, can you pick a magazine instead?

843
01:55:00,479 --> 01:55:04,760
You have the entire encyclopedia

844
01:55:05,159 --> 01:55:15,520
What do you mean too big? How many books are you carrying? I would probably read

845
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:21,710
I don't know like I would look I would pick up a time magazine and just go like this and

846
01:55:22,390 --> 01:55:25,560
Then look at the like the four cologne ads and

847
01:55:26,199 --> 01:55:29,800
Open them and be the guy that opens them and smells them and then puts closes it

848
01:55:31,979 --> 01:55:38,229
I wouldn't read any of the I don't read any of the articles. It's late, but you're hungry. What's a good midnight snack?

849
01:55:38,829 --> 01:55:43,869
gross

850
01:55:43,869 --> 01:55:50,729
Ice-cream this is still going. I can't fucking believe it's still gone

851
01:55:51,189 --> 01:55:54,810
You've got two weeks off from work and a lot of frequent flyer miles. Where are you going?

852
01:55:56,300 --> 01:56:02,489
Hawaii if you took up gardening, what would you what would be most likely? What would you grow with lemons?

853
01:56:03,050 --> 01:56:07,199
No, not orchids not roses. That's that's too generic

854
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:12,960
Vegetables whiz whiz lemons and limes. That's what I want with lemons vegetables. It's closest answer

855
01:56:13,439 --> 01:56:16,359
Your closest friend would most likely describe you as

856
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:24,020
Uniquely interesting. That's a way to say that somebody's scary without

857
01:56:24,640 --> 01:56:43,949
Making them angry a lot of fun. I'm a Clydesdale. I'm the I'm the uh

858
01:56:44,710 --> 01:56:48,600
That's the beer one. That's the one that's in the beer commercials. No, it's not

859
01:56:49,119 --> 01:56:56,979
Isn't that the is that the Anheuser and Anheuser bush? Yeah, it is that dad's Budweiser

860
01:56:57,180 --> 01:57:11,979
I've been drinking the same white cloth for two hours. This is disgusting now. I've been nursing this for two straight hours. That's gross

861
01:57:12,359 --> 01:57:16,789
You put the work. All right, this I don't like this music is like too

862
01:57:18,369 --> 01:57:22,770
Ominous. All right, you put the work in workhorse

863
01:57:22,770 --> 01:57:25,090
No one can stand in your way when you determine to get something done

864
01:57:25,289 --> 01:57:29,930
You're really equally comfortable working alone or in a team and when it's the latter you never

865
01:57:30,609 --> 01:57:34,930
Shirk your share of the duties. We also suspect that people just naturally like you

866
01:57:35,689 --> 01:57:38,710
Especially children. Oh and you fuck all the time

867
01:57:38,869 --> 01:57:43,329
You have sex in the kitchen in the laundry room with like thousands of different people

868
01:57:43,489 --> 01:57:46,729
You are fucking every day. All you do is have sex

869
01:57:46,729 --> 01:57:52,460
In fact, you may even have to have had sex ten minutes ago and ten minutes after the stream ends

870
01:57:52,979 --> 01:58:17,840
You're Clydesdale. Thanks for answering our fucked up questions. I remember I this is I'm afraid to do this one

02:00:18,020 --> 02:00:24,000
Okay, french fries. Yes onion rings. No ham sandwich

It's an ad generating machine. This may as well just this is just a minor

919
02:02:23,170 --> 02:02:27,649
It's just it's just a minor for humans to just just dump

920
02:02:28,449 --> 02:02:33,640
CPM you should get you. I've really looking I've reinstalled windows

It's gotta be having fun making memories the real answer was money by the way

02:04:28,500 --> 02:04:31,380
The king doesn't take any fucking chances at all ever

936
02:04:31,619 --> 02:04:37,210
The king tells other people to take chances and if they work out then he could be benefits and if they don't then well

939
02:04:53,939 --> 02:05:03,130
That's why they throw him out. They don't even see his full potential. He could be anything. I'm the Joker, baby

940
02:05:03,770 --> 02:05:09,449

958
02:07:40,380 --> 02:07:44,420
Sour patch kids are okay, but you can only have a few before they get gross fuzzy peaches. I've never had them

959
02:07:45,180 --> 02:07:52,550
I think sour watermelon slices would be my favorite here. We need it. Do we need a hair appointment here?

960
02:07:53,170 --> 02:08:02,630
Okay, okay pick a chocolate candy Mars bars are amazing. I would say Mars bars

02:08:11,119 --> 02:08:13,199
gummy bears

963
02:08:13,199 --> 02:08:18,979
Dude, it's just the original Harry bros Harry bros are so much better than Swedish fish

964
02:08:19,380 --> 02:08:24,260
Swedish fish just stick to the top you bite into a Swedish fish and you chew it like three times and it's like

965
02:08:24,260 --> 02:08:26,260
Just that's it's your teeth now

969
02:08:33,859 --> 02:08:40,229
Just the kind of shit you find like under the desk at school. No Halloween taffy. No, no tootsie pops

970
02:08:40,550 --> 02:08:55,220
Like a lame Halloween candy our smarties lame. I mean good and plenty is pretty fucking lame, but smarties

971
02:08:55,819 --> 02:09:02,779
They're especially good. I'm sorry mods. That's my fault

Pick a heart of runs. Oh, this is tough. This is really hard actually

974
02:09:09,100 --> 02:09:13,840
I'm gonna pick runs because you can never find them anymore

975
02:09:14,380 --> 02:09:20,020
Runs take the cake because you can find jolly ranchers are everywhere nerds are everywhere sweet tarts are everywhere, but runs

976
02:09:21,489 --> 02:09:28,170
only place you can find runs is it's if there's only a quarter of them left in the big fishbowl and it's

977
02:09:28,369 --> 02:09:33,659
50 cents and you get like six-year-old runs, but I like them. I wish they would

978
02:09:34,220 --> 02:09:41,899
Well, I'm just gonna be runs sorry pick a pop culture focused Halloween candy, I love free musketeers

Shit, I'll buy candy sticks forgot about these

981
02:09:56,260 --> 02:10:10,250
That's that that's cool. Pick a healthy Halloween candy if you're giving out skinny pop popcorn on Halloween

982
02:10:10,430 --> 02:10:16,260
You are a Satan worshiper you hand it out and you're like, okay kids

Your greatest fear in life is loneliness

988
02:10:49,449 --> 02:10:55,529
Nothing scares you more than being completely and utterly alone you welcome death but going to a movie or wait you welcome death

989
02:10:55,729 --> 02:11:03,939
But going to a movie by yourself is probably the worst thing that could ever happen to you. Fuck. Oh

This has been more accurate than any horoscope I've ever read it seems kind of weird. I got it right. I can't lie

The amount an entire company is worth in dollars

No piece of a whole share which offers entry to stock market at affordable price. It's that one a class

Yeah, the class I already got you the right answer fractional shares. You can buy a quarter or a third or as much as you're comfortable

1004
02:12:26,779 --> 02:12:28,619

1005
02:12:28,619 --> 02:12:35,020
What is a bull market the sign of the stock market is closed. No market in which prices are going down. That's a bear market

It's kind of important do your magic ability to hold on

1041
02:15:33,659 --> 02:15:41,699
What season do you plan on investing all of them? You should invest in capital one. No, you shouldn't

1042
02:15:41,779 --> 02:15:44,699

1054
02:18:07,549 --> 02:18:10,389
And they're like, maybe I guess he's fucking people to buy this shit

This is not real

1064
02:19:41,780 --> 02:19:43,780
To believe

02:19:47,139 --> 02:19:56,709
And I meet it this time that's not a real picture it's not I know it isn't

That's like you open up the door that's like the face that you make this like how you feel and how you look

1067
02:20:14,290 --> 02:20:19,250
When the raid ain't going so well has been 12 hours and you still have to first pull

undertale

1074
02:20:57,579 --> 02:21:12,280
Alright, can I say I'm gonna say this and I think it's accurate the undertale soundtrack could be

1075
02:21:12,719 --> 02:21:17,459
One of the best one of the top probably three

1076
02:21:18,260 --> 02:21:25,399
Soundtracks in any video game probably like top five at least somewhere in the top three. It just is well with okay

1077
02:21:25,399 --> 02:21:29,600
Whether you like this game. I don't like that. I like the fan base. I don't like them. Whatever

1078
02:21:30,200 --> 02:21:32,600
This these songs are objectively like fucking

1079
02:21:33,319 --> 02:21:36,129
bang

1080
02:21:36,129 --> 02:21:38,250
Minecraft and undertale those. Yeah, you're right. That's pretty high

1081
02:21:38,729 --> 02:21:47,819
okay, if I had you just like in a room and you like a blindfold on and you have like you like a thing covering your

1082
02:21:47,819 --> 02:21:52,700
Ears and like you didn't you didn't know what this was if I was like, all right, take it off

1083
02:21:52,739 --> 02:22:03,340
Take the headphones off take the eye shield off and you heard this. I was like, what do you think you'd be like, right?

1084
02:22:03,340 --> 02:22:09,809
I like it. It's good. This is good. And then I'd say hey, you know, that's from right now

1085
02:22:09,809 --> 02:22:17,329
What is this from Super Mario 2? No, it's from Earthbound. No, what's it from then? It's from undertale. I

1086
02:22:23,260 --> 02:22:29,159
Know it isn't it's not it can't be I can't I can't like it

1087
02:22:29,159 --> 02:22:40,790
I just can add in the middle of that song. All right, let's go this

1088
02:22:41,069 --> 02:22:46,700
Okay, the Marvel superhero teams are all drafting a new members. Which one do you want to be a part of?

1089
02:22:47,180 --> 02:22:52,139
nobody wants to be on the Fantastic Four now because there's only four of you and

1090
02:22:52,659 --> 02:22:57,500
If there's a job that has to be done one of those four people has to do it that would suck

1091
02:22:57,500 --> 02:23:04,579
I want to be on the X-Men because there's like 40 of us and if somebody has to go do something

1092
02:23:04,579 --> 02:23:10,139
Hey, we got we need like three magic users and a guy with a big fist and he like crystal

1093
02:23:10,819 --> 02:23:12,819
Explosives it's like okay

1094
02:23:13,139 --> 02:23:15,899
That could be like eight different people I can stay home. Oh

1095
02:23:16,979 --> 02:23:18,979
okay, like

1096
02:23:19,340 --> 02:23:20,620
Gambit and

02:23:20,620 --> 02:23:25,760
Cyclops and beast you guys you got that right? I can stay and just play fucking fortnight. Okay

1098
02:23:26,500 --> 02:23:31,579
Go for it, man. Like hey, I'll do I'll get the next one like tomorrow. If you're in the Fantastic Four you got to shit every day

1099
02:23:32,180 --> 02:23:38,040
Nope X-Men you can't like lounge on the couch. If you're mr. Fantastic

1100
02:23:38,840 --> 02:23:41,680
You can't like put that on somebody else

1101
02:23:42,200 --> 02:23:44,500
What motivates you?

1102
02:23:44,500 --> 02:23:55,340
This is fucking two and a half hours old. I'm gonna need another one. Do I even have did I buy two I did?

1103
02:24:02,530 --> 02:24:08,180

1104
02:24:08,180 --> 02:24:11,540
You're going on your third date with the most perfect person in the world

1105
02:24:12,420 --> 02:24:19,479
What did I tell you all the viewers here? This is I told you what makes though what makes them attractive to you?

1106
02:24:19,479 --> 02:24:22,420
Well, hold on. Let's get back over here. Ah

1107
02:24:23,559 --> 02:24:32,700
What's it what makes them attractive it's sarcastic and we they have a strong moral compass they got a wicked charm

1108
02:24:32,700 --> 02:24:40,020
They're super smart. They're really rich. They're super ripped. They can keep a secret. They just have this dark intensity to them

1109
02:24:40,579 --> 02:25:01,569
When it comes to relationship, would you ever date another superhero? Yes. Absolutely. I need someone who understands my lifestyle. No way. It's too dangerous

1110
02:25:01,569 --> 02:25:09,299
I'm not really interested. I feel like I feel like the answer is probably yeah

1111
02:25:09,860 --> 02:25:13,700
Because like if I levitate

1112
02:25:14,299 --> 02:25:20,799
The like the pizza rolls across the living room. They're not gonna be freaked out by that. They're gonna be like, oh, okay

1113
02:25:20,799 --> 02:25:24,559
You're a dick. But if I do that in front of someone that doesn't have powers, they're gonna be like

1114
02:25:25,280 --> 02:25:33,020
Couldn't you couldn't just get up? No, I couldn't just get up. Why couldn't you just get up?

1115
02:25:33,579 --> 02:25:37,940
Look, I've got fucking superpowers. I don't have to get up. You do you would never understand

1116
02:25:38,620 --> 02:25:43,540
Okay, if you had it your way you I can have it my way at Burger King

1117
02:25:44,059 --> 02:25:46,500
But I wouldn't want to go I wouldn't want to have it my way there

1118
02:25:46,500 --> 02:25:49,700
I'd want to go to McDonald's that I'm gonna go through the drive-through and just drive through it and go to the McDonald's next

1119
02:25:49,700 --> 02:25:50,860

No, something like it was like a was like a steak dinner or something up that fast food

1123
02:26:10,680 --> 02:26:15,030
You suspect someone close to you has betrayed you. What do you do?

1124
02:26:15,670 --> 02:26:21,850
Trick them into confessing. Please. Give me Loki. Please. Give me Loki. Please. Give me Loki

1125
02:26:21,850 --> 02:26:24,590
Please I'm gonna do everything that Loki would do so I get Loki and then I could share it

1126
02:26:24,790 --> 02:26:32,000
Hold on

1127
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:37,340
Give them the benefit of the doubt kill them before they do any damage destroy them, of course

1128
02:26:37,340 --> 02:26:41,579
Aren't these the same confront them about this terrible rumor find a way to use this to my advantage

1129
02:26:42,459 --> 02:26:44,459
I'll just have a few words with them over drinks

1130
02:26:44,860 --> 02:27:00,629
Dr. Doom has stolen the powers of the silver surfer and taken over the world. How will you stop him? I mean motherfucker

1131
02:27:00,629 --> 02:27:03,760

02:27:17,040 --> 02:27:20,100
Don't know is I don't have any fucking powers. I

1135
02:27:21,319 --> 02:27:23,319
Lied to my application

1136
02:27:23,479 --> 02:27:39,989
Okay, it's dr. Doom stole the powers of the silver too much Sonic the Hedgehog. No, no, halo. No, no battlefield one

1137
02:27:39,989 --> 02:27:50,139

1138
02:27:50,879 --> 02:27:53,200
My goodness, this is the one I want

1139
02:27:53,799 --> 02:27:59,989
Okay, so dr. Doom stole the powers of the silver surfer and taking over the world how he stop him since dr

1140
02:28:00,030 --> 02:28:02,870
Doom was bound by honor. I tried to reason with him and he didn't work at peace force

1141
02:28:03,590 --> 02:28:09,739
I'd fight him. I'm smarter than him. My ego demands it. Well, that depends the person I love in danger

1142
02:28:10,659 --> 02:28:14,059
I'll always try to do the right thing. You know, that means getting my butt handed to me

1143
02:28:14,059 --> 02:28:20,350
I'd join the fantastic four and work as a team the situations bigger than me. No, you wouldn't no you wouldn't

1144
02:28:20,350 --> 02:28:25,790
We just don't we just discussed this. I would try to reason with dr. Doom first. Oh

1145
02:28:28,819 --> 02:28:32,840
You just got caught driving too fast and now you got a speeding ticket. What do you do?

1146
02:28:33,399 --> 02:28:36,360
I'd say, thank you officer and pay the fine

1147
02:28:37,399 --> 02:28:40,920
Please the police officer would be putty in my hands. I could talk them out of anything

1148
02:28:41,440 --> 02:28:46,350
I'd rip the ticket up flip off the cop and be on my merry way

1149
02:28:46,870 --> 02:28:55,459
I'd try to make the cop laugh and get out of the ticket

1150
02:28:55,459 --> 02:29:00,260
But if that didn't work out accepted and move on I would I would talk I would please

1151
02:29:00,940 --> 02:29:04,459
What's your favorite part about being a superhero?

1152
02:29:04,899 --> 02:29:08,659
Having the coolest toys and meeting other people like me. I always thought I was alone

1153
02:29:08,979 --> 02:29:11,020
These are my powers to help others who can't help themselves

1154
02:29:11,940 --> 02:29:20,469
I kind of like the mystery aspect of it. I better not get Superman. That's boring

1155
02:29:20,870 --> 02:29:25,510
One of your co-workers is always putting you down. What do you do about it? Okay, is the co-worker also a superhero?

1156
02:29:26,030 --> 02:29:33,979
Or is it just like I'm working in the office for it. Is it just as a superhero?

1157
02:29:33,979 --> 02:29:37,500
Are we also is it X-Men is it an X character?

1158
02:29:37,500 --> 02:29:43,829
I'd pull the person aside and talk to them privately found out what's really going on, you know

1159
02:29:43,829 --> 02:29:46,950
I can only take so much before I explode. I'll just walk away. I've got bigger fish to fry

1160
02:29:47,110 --> 02:29:49,350
I just write back to them and make them cry

1161
02:29:50,069 --> 02:29:57,620
I'd take whatever they say is a compliment and defuse the situation. I turn their insult into a joke and then we would all laugh at them

1162
02:29:57,979 --> 02:30:03,500
Nick Fury has asked you to represent shield and go out to dinner with a very important

1163
02:30:04,659 --> 02:30:08,950
That turned in a different way. Oh

1164
02:30:09,950 --> 02:30:15,629
Nick Fury has asked you to represent shield and go on a very important mission. Oh, actually, this is perfect for me

1165
02:30:17,379 --> 02:30:19,379
Me can I do that one?

1166
02:30:19,459 --> 02:30:25,079
You only catch the breath is atrocious, ah, can I be the guy that goes at the dinner and it's fine

1167
02:30:25,079 --> 02:30:26,639
I don't have to get in harm's way

1168
02:30:26,639 --> 02:30:33,540
Okay, their breath is terrible. I'd ignore their breath and pay for the meal. I'd cancel the dinner in order takeout

1169
02:30:33,540 --> 02:30:35,700
I can't stand annoying smelly people

1170
02:30:36,139 --> 02:30:44,790
I'd politely offer a mint and say this is a rare candy from another dimension that must be enjoyed

1171
02:30:45,229 --> 02:30:51,860
It might be that one because then you can laugh you can laugh about that

1172
02:30:52,379 --> 02:30:55,319
give them the mint and you both go like

1173
02:30:57,129 --> 02:30:59,299
It's an altoid

1174
02:30:59,459 --> 02:31:03,780
And you're in and everything's fine and like they're good that would work

1175
02:31:04,040 --> 02:31:10,950
I'd end the meal quickly and say sorry, but Nick Fury needs me to save the world

1176
02:31:11,270 --> 02:31:17,659
That would be this one. You have a big day planned at work, but wake up with a cold. What do you do?

1177
02:31:21,440 --> 02:31:26,579
Hmm roll back up and get some rest. There's no way I'm going to work today suck it up and go to work

1178
02:31:26,579 --> 02:31:30,059
No, call my boss and let them sick that I can work remotely going back to bed

1179
02:31:30,379 --> 02:31:38,780
What's your relationship to large family gatherings like holidays and family reunions? I think they're great. I like them

1180
02:31:39,260 --> 02:31:43,180
Pick one thing from a fairy tale to have with you in everyday life. What is it?

1181
02:31:43,500 --> 02:31:46,950
Why would you carry on a poison apple?

1182
02:31:46,950 --> 02:31:55,930

1191

Where would you rather explore deep sea man? The deep deep space is just I feel like it's a bunch of nothing

1192
02:32:45,700 --> 02:32:51,379
It's just a bunch of like colors and little lights and shit and that's cool

1193

But this creatures we haven't even seen before in the deep sea

1194
02:32:54,420 --> 02:32:59,680
It would be so interesting to be under there and just like lie on the ground and look at all of the sharks and stuff

1195
02:32:59,680 --> 02:33:03,629
And all of the weird deep sea animals deep space is too much. It's too much to do

1196
02:33:03,629 --> 02:33:08,049
I would freak me out. I'd be like, oh cool deep space

1198
02:33:11,049 --> 02:33:12,450
Even if I fly with my superpowers

1199
02:33:12,450 --> 02:33:17,389

I could go back in time and I could like I could go forward in time and see what happens and just go back

1208
02:34:25,700 --> 02:34:27,739
And then fix it and then go forward again, and then it's stuck

1209
02:34:28,059 --> 02:34:37,059

They're boring. I can't hold a conversation one of us forgets their wallet. They're into astrology

1224
02:36:17,780 --> 02:36:28,299
That's probably this one because that's just fucking awkward because then it makes the other person have to pay for the meal and then it's like

1225
02:36:28,299 --> 02:36:29,979

I don't know if I want to eat sushi every day though

1233
02:37:03,659 --> 02:37:06,940
I feel like it really it would I probably get sick if I ate it too much

It's it's like the first part of a chorus and they just say it like six times and the show starts

1526
03:15:07,899 --> 03:15:10,629
I've seen like eight episodes of the show

That would be strange

1546
03:17:23,829 --> 03:17:29,280
Okay, I gotta do this test. You usually walk fairly fast with small steps

1547
03:17:29,840 --> 03:17:35,190
Let's fast head down and then a meme about this

1548
03:17:36,030 --> 03:17:43,239
No, there's a meme where it's like it's like the virgin right? No, I

1549
03:17:47,040 --> 03:17:48,079
walk

1550
03:17:48,079 --> 03:17:55,020
Asked with long no small steps when talking to people you stand with your arms folded

1551
03:17:55,219 --> 03:18:00,840
Have your hands clasped of one or both of your hands at your hips

1552
03:18:01,360 --> 03:18:06,479
Not sure push the person to whom you're talking to play with your ear or hair

I usually say I usually kind of like this like no, I don't do that. I definitely touch my hair all the time

1556
03:18:31,379 --> 03:18:35,680
Okay, when relaxing you sit with your knees bent with your legs neatly side by side

1557
03:18:36,520 --> 03:18:42,200
The legs I usually sit like with what I usually sit with like my legs crossed like this

1558
03:18:42,799 --> 03:18:44,920
that

1559
03:18:44,920 --> 03:18:56,059
but not like crossed crossed like

1560
03:18:56,620 --> 03:19:03,059
Like like the shoe is this way. You know, I mean not like at the knee. I'm talking about like shoe kind of crossed over

1561
03:19:03,899 --> 03:19:11,860
Okay, uh when somebody really amuses you you react with a laugh, but not I usually laugh a little bit

1562
03:19:11,860 --> 03:19:13,860
No, I don't react that strongly

1563
03:19:13,899 --> 03:19:16,280
When you go to a party or a social gathering you

1564
03:19:16,920 --> 03:19:19,879
Make a loud entrance so that everyone notices you I don't want to do that

1565
03:19:20,239 --> 03:19:28,610
Like a quiet entrance looking around for someone, you know, yeah, I usually kind of be like where the fuck is

1566
03:19:29,129 --> 03:19:34,489

Green and aqua. I like aqua Queen

1571
03:20:06,629 --> 03:20:14,209
When you are in a bad when you're in a bed at night in those last few moments before you go to sleep you are

1572
03:20:14,950 --> 03:20:19,649
Stretched out on your back stretched out face down on your side curled

1573
03:20:20,170 --> 03:20:25,329
Yeah, like I'm on my side curled up and I'm gonna get my I'm out

1574
03:20:25,729 --> 03:20:28,680
No, I feel like I would get suffocated

1575
03:20:29,079 --> 03:20:33,110
You often dream that you are

1576
03:20:33,549 --> 03:20:36,629
Fighting or struggling searching for something flying or floating

1577
03:20:38,799 --> 03:20:54,049
Usually that's usually it is like fighting or like searching. It's usually searching. Okay, dr. Phil

Practical and always interesting someone who's constantly in the center of attention, but sufficiently well-balanced

1581
03:21:14,559 --> 03:21:16,559
Not to be let it go

1582
03:21:17,479 --> 03:21:20,100
Like all things should be

1583
03:21:20,100 --> 03:21:24,700
They also see you as a kind considerate understanding someone who'll always cheer them up and help them up

1584
03:21:24,700 --> 03:21:37,139
Oh, wow, I didn't want to get zero to 20 didn't want to get 60 and up

1585
03:21:37,260 --> 03:21:45,879

What's next? What is on here for fun? I just I wanted to put this on here for fun

03:22:16,209 --> 03:22:18,209

I have to be this way. I have to be this way

1593
03:22:28,739 --> 03:22:32,180
Why now you've probably heard of among us a party game

1594
03:22:32,180 --> 03:22:37,059
Will you play a little astronaut crew member being hunted by an imposter or you plays the imposter?

1595
03:22:37,139 --> 03:22:39,819
It's an incredibly fun and addictive way to lose friends

1596
03:22:40,829 --> 03:22:45,389
Anyway, here's a quiz to find out if you're the imposter or not because you've been acting a little sus

1597
03:22:45,389 --> 03:22:47,549
Oh, you can see me doing that. I hate that

1598
03:22:47,549 --> 03:22:55,819
I hate when I do like a voice and you can see my face fuck off. What all right fine

Scrambled eggs or breakfast sandwiches waffles are too messy and they're too heavy donuts are not good for you

Pancakes are too. It's you can't eat one and then you throw you throw it away. It's not good

Every time a look those of you that want to talk shit about my pancake preference

03:25:24,659 --> 03:25:32,430
I wanted as a side not the main thing so breakfast sandwich

1625
03:25:34,340 --> 03:25:40,149
I'll pick something for lunch. Am I so am I this boring?

1626
03:25:41,229 --> 03:25:55,920
It's just sandwiches every day sandwiches all day probably tacos. I love tacos tacos

1627
03:25:57,440 --> 03:25:59,860
Food pick something for dinner, okay

1628
03:26:00,739 --> 03:26:01,700
Uh

1629
03:26:01,700 --> 03:26:20,270
Pulled pork sandwich. Holy shit. That sounds pretty good right now pick a color green pick an animal pick a random word

1630
03:26:20,790 --> 03:26:28,930
Crazy pick a TV show. I like spongebob

1631
03:26:29,450 --> 03:26:36,159
Any use infer no Scooby-Doo and rugrats. Yes, these are actually

1632
03:26:36,799 --> 03:26:39,739
Okay, if you take out Phineas and Ferb, this is a hard one

1633
03:26:44,260 --> 03:26:47,680
Like I can just I could take Phineas and Ferb and just literally just go like that and I don't care

1634
03:26:48,559 --> 03:26:51,780
Bob's burgers, I think Bob Bob's burgers will be next in line

1635
03:26:52,120 --> 03:26:58,780
For it to me just to be like no and then probably Scooby-Doo. So I've narrowed this down to spongebob Futurama and rugrats

1636
03:26:59,299 --> 03:27:02,469
Rugrats I grew up on this show. So of course, I'm gonna love it

1637
03:27:03,569 --> 03:27:09,870
Futurama is the best Matt Groaning show. It's not the fucking Simpsons and it's not that new one. Whatever the fuck that one is

1638
03:27:11,000 --> 03:27:13,719
Enchantment or whatever not that one. It's this one

1639
03:27:14,780 --> 03:27:19,760
So it's probably gonna come down to because this is just nostalgia rose colored nostalgia eyeballs

1640
03:27:20,540 --> 03:27:27,969
spongebob in Futurama

1641
03:27:28,010 --> 03:27:48,639

Don't like it chocolate chip maybe peanut butter unbelievable

1644
03:28:14,219 --> 03:28:23,399
Peanut butter chocolate chip though. No just chocolate chip, but they gotta be soft. No crunchy cookies are all throw up

1645
03:28:23,559 --> 03:28:32,079
Like a movie genre, I don't like dark chocolate it's too it's too heavy. It's too much. It tastes almost like bitter and sour

1646
03:28:32,079 --> 03:28:37,479
It's I don't like the flavor. I could I would you know, I like dark chocolate shavings on top of whipped cream

1647
03:28:37,479 --> 03:28:42,950

1651
03:29:05,250 --> 03:29:06,809
The day of the week

1652
03:29:06,809 --> 03:29:15,920
Okay, most people would say a weekend, but I'm gonna have to give you I'm gonna flip this on here

1653
03:29:16,239 --> 03:29:22,649
I'm gonna say Thursday. The reason why Thursday is the best day the week is cuz it Friday. Yes, Friday's great

1654
03:29:22,649 --> 03:29:26,670
It's the end of the week and there's like the weekend but Thursday lets you

1655
03:29:27,709 --> 03:29:33,340
Anticipate the Friday because you know on Friday, you're gonna feel great. So Thursday is like, alright, here we go

1656
03:29:33,579 --> 03:29:41,930
Friday's tomorrow and it prepares your brain like Thursday's best day of the week. Here comes Friday. I'm looking forward to it

1659
03:30:14,729 --> 03:30:20,840
Okay, I think I'd rather be Donald Duck because Daffy Duck uses firearms

1660
03:30:21,239 --> 03:30:30,280
Doesn't he? I want to be Donald Duck. Daffy Duck's like a crazy

1661
03:30:33,020 --> 03:30:39,549
But in the episodes where Daffy Duck like shoots Bugs Bunny, Donald never does that

1662
03:30:39,549 --> 03:30:47,850
He just kind of freaks out and spins around in a circle and people ignore him. I'm a Donald. I'm a Donald Duck

1663
03:30:48,450 --> 03:30:55,809
