1
00:00:48,630 --> 00:01:07,560
What's going on? What's up? Who are we? I don't know. Chat? I mean, you're all individuals here.

2
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:19,140
I don't know who you all are, but I know you all are potential individuals. I don't know. Anyways,

3
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:33,430
hello. How are you? What drink is this? Uh, it is a water with some hydrating powder in it.

4
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:43,930
I need some hydration today. Feeling a little dehydrated. Have I seen Breath of the Wild 2

5
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:53,299
gameplay? Uh, I, no, I haven't. I, I need to beat the first one before I care about the second one

6
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,780
because I will see all the improved gameplay mechanics in the new one and then go, I don't

7
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:05,420
want to play the old one anymore. The second you show me like the new glider in the new Breath of

8
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,879
the Wild, it's like, well, I gotta wait like two weeks. I can just play that one. Three weeks,

9
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:17,300
whatever it is. Was it April, May? He's never going to finish Breath of the Wild 1. Well,

10
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:27,500
it's funny you say that because that's the exact plan after today. I think we are in the last,

11
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:35,080
I want to say like three or four hours of Resident Evil 4 depending on how long it takes.

12
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:43,750
Maybe four hours plus an hour of maybe the extra content. I'll try. Because what? Chapter 13,

13
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:56,840
14, right? No spoilers, please. Go back to sorcery or sorcery. I feel bad for sorcery.

14
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:07,460
I'm going back to Breath of the Wild, but not sorcery. Sorcery Shans in shambles right now.

15
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:23,219
That's a, hey, that was pretty cool. Everything started with an S. Sorcery Shans. Everything

16
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:27,539
has to have like, let's get 50 slugs. Steven is the title today. That's why I said that.

17
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:34,979
All right. You guys ready? Get through the rest of a Resident Evil 4. You guys good?

18
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:46,259
Alliteration. Yeah. Alliteration nerd. I have like a soft spot for alliteration.

19
00:03:47,270 --> 00:04:01,240
California Circus of Maryland Magicians. 50 slugs. Steven. No, I'm not ready. Give me a minute. All

20
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:09,780
right. You get a minute. You get one minute. Hey, you gave me an extra 10 minutes. So I'm going to

21
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:16,920
give you an extra one minute. I think that's fair. I'll give you an extra one minute. That's fair.

22
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:29,800
Me too? All right. Everybody go. Go do what you got to do. You got one minute. Somebody just got

23
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:38,620
really annoyed because I started my stream and the of your washing machine just went off and you're

24
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,939
like, I have to go turn that over, dude. And it's going to take like 10 fucking minutes. Of course,

25
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:55,529
he started right when the washing machine went off. This guy should play Zomboid. I said I wanted to,

26
00:04:55,529 --> 00:05:02,680
but I don't know. The game feels really involved. Is Project Zomboid a game where you have to really,

27
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,399
really know everything that's going on? I feel like I'm going to die in the first 10 minutes

28
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:14,009
and then go, wow, that was, I don't get it and leave. Is that possible? Seems like a really cool

29
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:31,100
game. That's the point. That's exactly what the point is. Huh. Okay. What about another FMV game

30
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:36,009
stream? There are a couple of FMV games that have come out that I want to play, but I feel like we

31
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:43,500
played a lot of the really, really important old ones. It is actually tough to find an FMV game

32
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:55,100
that I've not played on this stream. We've done them all almost. I played almost the entire FMV

33
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:09,079
catalog of 3DO games. And then before that too, on old PC, Bad Mojo is an FMV game. I did not play

34
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:13,000
that for like 20 minutes and I thought it was just, I couldn't control it well. Something was wrong.

35
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,399
I didn't, I didn't like it. I don't know why. Something was wrong with that. I tried to play it.

36
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:22,490
Maybe the port was fucked up and I couldn't capture it. It was something weird with that one.

37
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:30,939
All right. What about public domain movies? Yeah. Well, where's my headphones? Hold on.

38
00:06:30,939 --> 00:07:44,860
I don't even know. They're not even here. Found them. What do you mean? Hello. I just, I told you

39
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:52,379
I had to go BRB for a second. What about the Dead Space remake? There's a lot of shit that

40
00:07:52,379 --> 00:08:04,120
I really want to play. Well, we'll see. Let's get through this first. Resident Evil 4 chapter number

41
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:26,040
14. Oh, it's in the junk draw again. Well, the forest sequel. Oh shit. You guys can't see this one.

42
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:32,019
Hey, I don't know. Nah, I didn't, I didn't really play the forest one.

43
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:49,299
Final arc of the game, by the way. Don't even say it. Did your head get bigger?

44
00:08:52,809 --> 00:08:55,769
I don't think so. Did my head get bigger in two days?

45
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:04,889
I guess I changed too. It just keeps slowly increasing in size.

46
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:17,370
I think I adjusted the camera. Yeah. This is the chapter that has the scary thing that I don't

47
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:31,450
like. So I'm preparing myself off cameraman. What do you think? You look like it's smelly today.

48
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:39,669
Yeah, you're probably right. Don't think too hard, handsome. See you later.

49
00:09:39,669 --> 00:09:55,269
Hardcore run next, Howard. Yeah, I told you I'm going to, I'm going to stream standard.

50
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,870
I have a hardcore gaming mindset though. Very important for you to understand.

51
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:08,629
And then I'll do hardcore later. Hardcore is going to happen on my own time. I'm going to play if I

52
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:23,220
do. We've got Breath of the Wild to play. Tag me when Jerma lies. Oh, that's just your name.

53
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:38,870
Time that person off 30 seconds for having that name. Sniper rifle would be pretty,

54
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:46,379
let's avoid those pretty good here. No rifle. I, oh, by the way, for those of you that are wondering,

55
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:51,820
yes, I have a, the reason why the title is 50 slugs, Steven. If you've missed some of these

56
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:57,899
streams or if you missed the last one, we'll go over it very briefly. I put $300,000 into this

57
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:07,220
shotgun. It can hold 48 slugs and it shoots a slug every second. It seems to be working pretty

58
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:22,870
good. Striker Andy. Why is your voice so deep today? Oh, I had like a yogurt. I had like,

59
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:40,169
I had two yogurts and it made my like voice all yogurt-y. There you are. Nope. Wait. I don't want

60
00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:48,789
to pass up any treasures. This thing's been really useful as well. At first I thought it was

61
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:56,379
fucking yogurt. I swear to God. Don't get scanned by this. I can take it up by shooting it, right?

62
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:09,190
I can't. All right. I'm not going that way. Does this kill you? Oh, wait, I go up there.

63
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:26,740
New items. This thing looks kind of cool and easy to handle. Oh, it's a magnum.

64
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:43,779
Okay. Do I, is it, which, which one is more powerful? This thing is 24, 27 at full power.

65
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:48,200
Knife needs care, everyone. That one, the killer seven is way more powerful.

66
00:12:50,139 --> 00:13:04,009
Okay. That's the best magnum. Killer seven by far. Yeah. So I'm going to sell this.

67
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:10,700
It's not the best, but it's good. So I should sell this, get that one, and then start upgrading

68
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:19,139
that one. Butterfly does more damage. Does it? Are you sure? Butterfly technically has higher

69
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:29,620
power. What do you mean by that? The way this, if I get this, then this would be the one I'm going

70
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:35,049
to use. I'm going to keep this one. The exclusive on the butterfly is way more powerful. All right.

71
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:43,639
Well, then I'm going to keep this one. You can compare stats. I, but I think I have to own it.

72
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:54,259
Don't I? I think I have to own the weapon to compare stats. Don't I? Oh, no, I don't. All

73
00:13:54,259 --> 00:14:12,330
right. I mean, but this thing is upgraded though. 24. This one's not even upgraded. I don't know.

74
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:15,129
I think this one's probably going to be stronger, but what's the exclusive on this?

75
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:25,269
The exclusive is what puts this over the top. All right. So yeah. All right. So 28, 27 of the

76
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:28,309
exclusive will put this one over the top. What's the exclusive on this one? Can I see it?

77
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:38,659
What is the exclusive on it? It's five times crit damage. All right. I'm going to keep the,

78
00:14:38,659 --> 00:14:52,440
I'm keeping the one I have. This thing is done. Ooh. Okay. So let's get rid of these.

79
00:14:56,789 --> 00:15:04,789
I could sell the golden egg. Yeah. I mean, it's, it's 10 grand. I'm just going to sell it.

80
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:12,259
Keep it. No, no, no. Keep it. Why? Sell the egg. It's 10 grand. It's 10,000. That's $10,000.

81
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:24,039
Well, I can't do anything else though. Another upgrade ticket.

82
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:32,710
You could make a golden omelet. That'd be kind of funny if that was real.

83
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:50,460
Is that real? That's not real, right? You can't make a golden omelet. Yes it is. There's no

84
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:58,299
golden omelet. You guys are full of shit. There's no golden omelet in this game. The golden omelet.

85
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:12,179
Really? Who cooks it? How do you make it? Yeah. You guys are full of shit. You guys are full of

86
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:16,820
shit. There's no golden omelet. I've played this game like fucking 10 times already. There's no

87
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:28,409
golden omelet. All right. Actually, thanks to the one, one guy that said to, uh, repair the knife

88
00:16:28,409 --> 00:17:11,769
because I would not have. What the hell is that? A nail gun? Oh my God. Oh shit. Run away. Whoa.

89
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:38,380
Oh my God. Watch out. I want to save ammo. Nice voice. Did I voice crack? I did? When? I got a

90
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:54,279
better idea. Okay. We just got, every time I start this game again, I have to, I got to get back into

91
00:17:54,279 --> 00:18:08,380
the swing of it. 50 slugs even. Yeah. Well, I had no health. I didn't have any health. I need flash

92
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:30,059
bangs. Okay. I need some more of this. Here we go. Flash grenade. Thank you. That's going to help

93
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:35,160
immensely. I'm at max health, so I don't have to worry about yellow herbs anymore. Let's go ahead

94
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:44,650
and mix two of them. I do not care about yellow herbs. I have a max HP now. Nice yogurt voice.

95
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:58,890
Why did they harmonize that? That was very strange. All right. I'm going in now. Let's go.

96
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,250
You know what I'm talking about? You guys know what I'm talking about, right?

97
00:19:41,930 --> 00:20:01,910
Right? I hope people know what I mean by that. Where's he going? Is he running? Oh my God. He's

98
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:30,730
sprinting. Okay. Hold on. Yeah. I don't know why when I shoot this, I do that. If you watch

99
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:38,490
every time I've shot that shotgun, I've gone, yeah. Every time. Why? Why am I making that sound?

100
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:43,289
What's the point? Why am I doing that? I don't do that with anything else. Any other gun I have.

101
00:20:44,089 --> 00:21:01,640
The guy holding two. Who did that? What was that? That guy just got lit the fuck up.

102
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:22,329
Don't do it. Don't do it. All right. We're good. He did the trope. He did the squibs.

103
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:30,890
The like, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. You know, I love that. That's like so the squib

104
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:45,849
attack on like the person's chest. Anytime that they do that in movies where it's like,

105
00:21:46,569 --> 00:22:09,430
it's just like, what the fuck is going on here? What is a squib? The device that is in a vest

106
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:14,329
in movies and TV shows that has the little like spurt come out. Like as if it was

107
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:25,640
a, like a, like a getting shot. It's a little device that's made for movies. Can I move this?

108
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:51,240
It's all CGI now. It is. I think for the most part. They still do use practicals. Yeah. I mean,

109
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:58,710
depends on what movie, I guess. Right. Or what show. How do I get this milk voice out?

110
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:07,670
How do I cure milk voice? Anybody know? All right. Am I missing anything in here?

111
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:22,809
There are no treasures. I need more water. I got, hold on. Is that better? No, it's not.

112
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:30,549
I should probably lean into it then. Yeah. I think I'll lean into it then. I'm the guy with

113
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:35,190
a really, really deep voice and really kind of gravelly voice today. Yeah. I think I'll

114
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:46,900
lean into it. This is just going to shoot me if I walk into it. Okay. That's not an alarm.

115
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:53,380
That is the machine gun. Okay. So what did I, I need to move this. How do I do that? I want to

116
00:23:53,380 --> 00:24:16,490
pick up the items. I can't climb in this. You live in that house. I'm back. Stop. Don't get me on

117
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:34,099
that. I, that's not an HD scanner. I thought, well, it technically is a scanner. Where does this move

118
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:45,289
to? Does that really even help? But hold on. I know I'm, I'm collect every item guy. I'm sorry.

119
00:24:45,289 --> 00:24:59,880
I am. Can I not get that? I need to move this. How do I move this? There's a chest right here.

120
00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:09,289
Wait, I don't even need to move it because I just moved to this, right? Oh, we're good.

121
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:32,390
There we go. All right. Got it. Go. Okay. We're good. Collect everything. Nice bangle. Yeah. It

122
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:42,940
is going to be a nice bangle when I sell it for 10, $15,000. You still have that. Got it on your

123
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:48,619
soundboard from the Wario where stream? Uh, no, that's, that's been cleared out. Unfortunately,

124
00:25:49,339 --> 00:26:00,970
I think even scoring has gone. Sorry. Yeah. It's fucked up. It's actually pretty screwed up.

125
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:10,099
And I fucked this up again. How did I screw this up? No, I'm all right. Right. So to move this.

126
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:30,309
Yeah, we're good. Yeah. Scoring has gone too. I know I screwed up items. I actually do have

127
00:26:30,309 --> 00:26:50,700
to conserve handgun ammo, so let's make this happen. Okay. Really? That's annoying. What the

128
00:26:50,700 --> 00:27:00,170
fuck did you spit at me? What happened to conserving ammo? I just used everything.

129
00:27:01,049 --> 00:27:33,900
Get this loaded up. How does that miss? How are these missing? Can you please lie so I can tag

130
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:52,680
that guy? Shoot him. Stop shooting. Shoot him. Pick what you want to do, Jeremy. Stop shooting.

131
00:27:52,680 --> 00:28:13,740
Shoot him. Don't shoot. Stop shooting him. I didn't even lie. Watch out for it. Watch out.

132
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:29,319
Watch out. I shot that guy in the shoulder every single time. I got 50. Ooh, what's over there?

133
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:48,630
Shit. Shit. I missed that. It's all, it's all the way back. I can't get that from here. It's

134
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:59,539
all the way back. Shoot them in the knee cap. Could go back and get it. Is it actually a treasure

135
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:12,099
treasure? It's not on the map though. All right. I'm doing this only once. There they are. Okay.

136
00:29:12,099 --> 00:29:19,609
It's a legendary treasure. I don't think it is, but I do want to go get it. How often do I trim

137
00:29:19,609 --> 00:29:31,940
my nails? Um, it's going to be worth like 5k. Let's just see. The thing about Resident Evil

138
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:36,819
games, especially from four onward, is you really do want to get as many of those treasures as you

139
00:29:36,819 --> 00:29:42,710
can. It just makes your life so much easier later. Upgrading everything you want. Spending all the

140
00:29:42,710 --> 00:30:12,680
money. Here we go. Um, 600 and, uh, no, it was worth it. It was worth it. Ammo I didn't have

141
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:33,559
before. It was worth it. What was that? What is, what is this? Weird. Okay. Are you liking

142
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:44,230
this better than Resident Evil 2? No, I think, well, a lot of Resident Evil 2 is being chased,

143
00:30:45,259 --> 00:30:48,460
which as you know, from my experience, the granny likes, I really don't like,

144
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:59,180
but in Resident Evil 2, it didn't feel, it, I was okay with that. I thought it was fine.

145
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:14,420
What's a granny like? Um, can we, how do I explain this? Granny like is when you have

146
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:23,059
to collect a bunch of items and, okay, let me, how do I spell this out? Okay. You open,

147
00:31:23,059 --> 00:31:27,299
the game opens. You're in a house. You're in a, or you're in a grocery store. You're in a

148
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:34,500
mall or you're in a home. It doesn't matter where you are. And there's a piece of bubble gum

149
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:42,200
the next to you. It's a bubble gum. You got it. Okay. And then to your left is, uh, a sink

150
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,890
that's missing a pipe. And you don't know, you know, you're going to have to come back with a

151
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:53,509
fucking pipe to put on that sink, but you don't know where the pipe is. So eventually you end

152
00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:59,269
up running around an hour or so later, 40 minutes later, you get a pipe and then you

153
00:31:59,269 --> 00:32:03,910
have to go back and put the pipe on and then use the gum to plug up the sink. And then you

154
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:07,029
got to take the thing, the, the key that you get out of the sink and go put it into the floorboard

155
00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:12,519
and then from the floor, but it's, it's just, and then all that time, all while you're doing that,

156
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:19,400
somebody is chasing you and you die if they get you. I don't like it. I don't like those.

157
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:34,230
That's a granny like, what does it have to do with grannies? Cause there's a very popular game

158
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:40,069
called granny where granny chases you around and you have to fucking pick up the floorboards and

159
00:32:40,069 --> 00:32:48,390
put like gum into the sink and find the wrench to then like open the fucking door to the, the,

160
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:56,819
the, you know, the, the basement. It's granny. I want to kick you off here. Holy shit. That was

161
00:32:56,819 --> 00:33:15,400
cool. Kill this guy. Like hello neighbor. Yes, exactly. That came out of alpha yet.

162
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:26,339
I have not heard about that game in like six years. Is this, I remember that game was like,

163
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:30,019
and it was like a, in alpha for a long time. I was like, Oh, what is this game?

164
00:33:33,529 --> 00:33:38,410
Is it, is it actually still not out? No, no, I've seen like ads for like a sequel. It has to be out,

165
00:33:39,799 --> 00:34:07,299
but that's a granny like it already has a sequel. Is it any good? I don't want to kill this guy

166
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:12,900
because I feel, I feel like he's trying to figure a puzzle out with a crowbar, which is exactly the

167
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:16,469
kind of person that I want to make sure stays around. This guy's trying to figure this out

168
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:28,630
with a crowbar and I feel really bad about this. Oh, that's what you were doing. He made pretty

169
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:40,730
good progress. It was one of the smarter of the zombies. I think you want, can you have a

170
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:46,250
Roblox stream? My mom really wants you to play Roblox. No, I'm not going to play Roblox. Not

171
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:50,780
right now. Probably not ever. Probably never. That's never, I'm just going to tell you right

172
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:56,500
now. That's never going to happen. I'm literally never going to play Roblox. Not that I don't,

173
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:01,619
I just, I just, I'm not going to, right? Like that's all I have to say. I don't need to explain why

174
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:05,539
I don't really want to. I don't need to tell you the reasoning. I'm just not going to do it.

175
00:35:05,539 --> 00:35:10,659
And that's all that needs to be said. That's it. There's your answer. Are you going to play Roblox?

176
00:35:10,659 --> 00:35:17,500
No, I'm not going to play Roblox at any point. I hope it's, I hope you have fun in Roblox.

177
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:23,179
Seems like a pretty interesting world. I'm never playing Roblox ever on this stream,

178
00:35:23,739 --> 00:35:30,900
ever. You understand? It's, it is never happening. All right. Now when, like a year from now when I

179
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:46,760
do play it, you can tag that guy. All right. Did I get everything? I think I did. There's a,

180
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:51,079
there's a bunch of like little areas to go explore. Hold on. Is that one? Yeah, I don't,

181
00:35:51,079 --> 00:36:01,780
I'm going to miss something, but who cares? Come on, sneak. This is really good looking though.

182
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:25,559
Rocket launcher. This isn't good. Night shot. You suck. Harry the rocket. I don't think you can,

183
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:50,650
man. Suplex. That did not even come close. What's wrong with that? Not bad, right? I have no need

184
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:58,780
for this, but I guess I'll just stick it in here, right? I'm at full house. It doesn't really matter.

185
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:08,489
Uh, can I take one more hit? I think I can. I can. I have body armor, so I definitely can take it.

186
00:37:30,059 --> 00:38:00,099
Don't! What is it? Dead? Dead. When are you going to have a skincare product line come out?

187
00:38:00,099 --> 00:38:35,800
What the hell is that sound? Oh, it's you. Skincare product? Going up there first. We're good,

188
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:47,449
right? Yeah. Treasures? Not listed. Oh, I need the map, don't I? Stop reading random ass messages,

189
00:38:47,449 --> 00:38:54,280
Ella Mayo. Yeah, but isn't that like kind of, what do you mean stuff reading random ass messages?

190
00:38:54,840 --> 00:39:02,789
What do you mean true? I'm streaming. I'm going to read some of the messages that come through.

191
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:23,829
Okay. I got a lot of gunpowder. I have 18 gunpowder. I need the little blue burrito,

192
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:52,039
whatever it is. What the hell is this? What is this? Remember April 5th. What's going on April 5th?

193
00:39:52,039 --> 00:40:03,190
April 5th. Remember, remember. When are you going to play Roblox? I'll play Roblox on your birthday.

194
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:18,860
Okay. Next year. Oh, he's a page. So what? What do you mean? Yeah, next year. When's his birthday?

195
00:40:23,429 --> 00:40:28,599
This doesn't hold off in court though. I could have been talking to anybody. I didn't know when

196
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:39,269
your birthday was. Could have been anybody's birthday. There's a paper trail on this.

197
00:40:41,909 --> 00:40:46,389
I'm not playing Roblox like next week. I'm telling you that's not happening.

198
00:40:56,519 --> 00:41:10,519
What if I watch a Roblox video or something? Is that sufficient for you? No, I'm not playing

199
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:19,079
Roblox. I'm not playing it. When I said next year, what I meant to say was I'll play Roblox on

200
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:29,559
your birthday. No. God damn it. Why does everybody have receipts? Like why do you have receipts on

201
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:35,800
this stream? Do you know what I'm saying? Like, come on. Why do you have receipts? I'm getting

202
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:45,929
red receipts right now. I never said I was going to. All right. When I say play Roblox,

203
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:52,920
if I open up the main menu, go like this. Do my options and then leave the game. It counts. I

204
00:41:52,920 --> 00:42:45,429
opened it. I'm trying to shoot the thing. Oh my God. I'm alive. Go. Okay. Stab. You have to play

205
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:51,480
Roblox for 30 consecutive minutes. That's not part of the deal. I did. I just said I was going to

206
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,599
play it on your birthday and I don't even know whose birthday I was talking about. It was

207
00:42:54,599 --> 00:43:08,309
misleading info. Misleading the witness. Leading. You're leading. I hear one of those bobbleheads.

208
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:18,550
Overruled. Objection, your honor. The witness, me, did not know that person's birthday

209
00:43:19,269 --> 00:43:22,869
and I agreed to something that it wasn't in writing and it was no contract. There's no

210
00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:26,550
verbal contract either because I didn't know exactly when the date was. I was never told that,

211
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:46,809
your honor. So, objection has been sustained. Thank you. Where is this thing? I can hear it.

212
00:43:46,809 --> 00:44:46,789
Where is it? Where is this thing? Where is it? Where is this thing? Above you? I don't care.

213
00:44:46,789 --> 00:44:53,559
Doesn't matter. All right. This is the treasure I gotta get. Somebody said I missed a treasure

214
00:44:53,559 --> 00:45:02,869
with a barrel or something. I told my mother you're going to play Roblox. I don't want to play

215
00:45:02,869 --> 00:45:12,340
Roblox. I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. It's really far back. Is it really? No, it's not,

216
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:41,719
is it? This is a shortcut anyway. No, it's not. All right. I'm gone. But yeah. All right. How

217
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:46,739
about this? We'll take a deal here. On your birthday, I will sing you a Roblox-themed

218
00:45:46,739 --> 00:45:52,260
happy birthday. We'll have a Roblox-themed birthday party for you. Like I'll get Roblox

219
00:45:52,739 --> 00:45:58,019
plates and cups and like a Roblox thing that hangs with balloons, and then I'm not even

220
00:45:58,019 --> 00:46:02,500
going to play the fucking game. That's a Roblox-themed birthday party. That doesn't

221
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:17,670
mean I'm going to have to play it. Do you accept my plea? My deal here? You know what the best part

222
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:22,710
about this? I don't even know who this person is. I have no idea who this is, but we're going to

223
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:40,780
have a birthday party for you. Okay. I fucking heard it too, and I just kept going. It's a binding.

224
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:45,829
Was that actually April 5th though? I don't want to do this. Actually, it's kind of funny.

225
00:46:45,829 --> 00:46:56,820
Maybe I do. Ooh, nice. Why are you scared of Roblox? I'm not scared of Roblox. I just don't.

226
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:01,699
It's just like, I can tell you like five things that I really just don't think I want to do

227
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:07,860
in the next few months. And one of them is play Roblox. I just don't, this just doesn't do

228
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:12,389
anything for me. And I don't really want to. Like, it's just like, why, why would I, I just

229
00:47:12,389 --> 00:47:18,039
don't want to play the game Roblox. You probably love it, but that's all right. This person is

230
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:36,619
going to get killed by this. No, you come to me. You come to me. He even was like, no, you come over

231
00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:51,670
here. There was something else down there. This is game progress. I don't want to do that yet.

232
00:47:59,659 --> 00:48:08,440
This is ultimate game progress. So nevermind. Okay. I'm supposed to check in to make sure

233
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:27,179
that didn't go anywhere. Have you ever been to Five Nights at Freddy's? The movie? You heard it

234
00:48:27,179 --> 00:48:36,710
here. He's afraid of Roblox. That's fine. Just wait till our Roblox-themed birthday party.

235
00:48:40,539 --> 00:48:43,420
You know what? I'm actually probably would rather play the game now that I think about it,

236
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:47,179
because then there'll be images of me on the internet wearing like a Roblox party hat

237
00:48:47,179 --> 00:48:53,820
and like eating cake off of a Roblox plate at 40. I don't know if I really want those images

238
00:48:54,619 --> 00:48:58,539
to be available to, you know, I don't think I want those images to be available.

239
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:23,719
Okay. Anything else in here? No. This is the worst part of the game coming up. This is the worst part

240
00:49:23,719 --> 00:49:32,170
of the game. I got through my one out of two of my least favorite scary, I hate being in this zone

241
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:39,639
areas and now we have to do the other one. I really don't want to, but I love this game.

242
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:53,619
So I'm going to do it. It's coming up here soon. My mom's grounding me and taking away my phone.

243
00:49:53,619 --> 00:50:12,550
Good. Good. Don't get off that thing. Don't use that fucking thing. Boomer. Good. Put that thing

244
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:27,820
down. Put that thing down. Why is he so mean tonight? Can I get an instant kill on the big guy?

245
00:50:34,219 --> 00:50:40,539
Maybe I would have if I did it the right time. Okay. I don't want to use it. I'm not going to

246
00:50:40,539 --> 00:51:04,219
use it. I'm going to go on. I'm going to, what are you doing? Got him. All right. Those things,

247
00:51:04,219 --> 00:51:09,369
those guys are not as bad now with all the power I have. You look decrepit tonight.

248
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:25,000
Somebody wants a birthday party on the fifth. You want a birthday party though, right?

249
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:31,639
Need a key card. Where's my birthday party? I want a Roblox themed birthday party. You're ugly.

250
00:51:32,440 --> 00:52:13,880
Spoiled, spoiled, spoiled. Hmm. Hmm. I need a card reader. Any trinkets? I'm looking for trinkets.

251
00:52:18,199 --> 00:52:30,280
Why are you being so scary? What are you talking about? You actually blocked it with the axe.

252
00:52:30,920 --> 00:53:13,019
Come on, go down. Down. Pretty good. Suplex. I'm actually really, really glad I got those.

253
00:53:13,019 --> 00:53:31,079
Okay, cool. I asked you if you've visited the movie set of Five Nights at Freddy's. No, I have

254
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:47,400
not visited the movie set. Why would I be on the movie set of Five Nights at Freddy's? I can't lie

255
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:54,900
your way out of this one. The great Ace Attorney Chronicles you said on January 4th. Yeah, speaking

256
00:53:54,900 --> 00:54:01,829
of attorneys, look at all these attorneys in chat. On January 4th, 2023, precisely 5 PM,

257
00:54:01,829 --> 00:54:07,190
you stated on your live stream in front of 12,000 witnesses that you were going to play

258
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:21,500
Ace Attorney at exactly 6 PM. I am going to play that. I'll play Ace Attorney. Well,

259
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:28,230
I will. I never said I wasn't going to play Ace Attorney. I just said I wasn't going to play it

260
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:39,590
right now. Play it eventually. That's going to be a good chill stream, I think. Pam, look at those

261
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:49,159
reflexes. Finger was in nose, left hand was off keyboard, picking nose, looking over here,

262
00:54:49,159 --> 00:54:54,739
talking to you. And I got that guy in the fucking head right when he jumped out. I don't want to

263
00:54:54,739 --> 00:54:59,940
hear it anymore. Look at how slow this guy is in games. I don't want to hear it anymore.

264
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:11,559
I don't want to hear it. I'm mean today. I'm mean right now. Ooh, that's Full Heel.

265
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:24,389
Another crown.

266
00:55:24,389 --> 00:55:30,070
She makes no difference. The price. Well, that's our choice to make.

267
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:38,739
I'm close to doing another 100k. I need, what do I need? I need a red. Yeah, I'm close to

268
00:55:38,739 --> 00:55:52,090
getting another 100k. Thank you. Life needs care every once in a while.

269
00:55:53,429 --> 00:56:03,559
This kind of work is about finesse, stranger. Little B goes a long way. You see. Dazzled,

270
00:56:03,639 --> 00:56:16,739
are you? Go. Oh, you have resources. Good. I need these. I really need those.

271
00:56:21,429 --> 00:56:35,300
Yes. All right. I got eight for that. All right. 40. I got 42 in here now.

272
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:40,699
The next revolver is coming up. Why do you keep upgrading that one? Because

273
00:56:40,699 --> 00:56:44,460
that one with the exclusive upgrade does the most damage of all the revolvers, doesn't it?

274
00:56:49,960 --> 00:57:02,789
Hmm. I need more of these. Where is the, there it is. Ooh, chicken egg. Not if the killer seven

275
00:57:02,789 --> 00:57:11,340
crits. True, but how many times do I have to shoot to reliably get a crit? I wonder. Like,

276
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:18,579
what's the percentage chance? I wonder. Change the outfit. Actually, that's a good point. Yeah,

277
00:57:18,579 --> 00:57:22,820
we can go back to the default now. The end of the game. We'll go back to the original. It's been,

278
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:28,659
it's been like 15 in-game hours or something since I had the original outfit on. I changed

279
00:57:28,659 --> 00:57:35,590
that within like the first two or three hours, didn't I? Yeah, I'll put it back. Vote for the

280
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:40,710
final outfit. Now that's fair. That's fair. All right. We're going to start with, um,

281
00:57:41,429 --> 00:57:50,730
let's start with Leon. Final outfit. I'm not changing it. Leon. Uh, I am going to veto one

282
00:57:50,730 --> 00:58:16,329
of these because there's only room for four slots. So I am vetoing. I'm vetoing hero.

283
00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:23,050
Nah, this was funny for a minute, but I'm vetoing hero. Your choices are default, villain, casual,

284
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:35,369
or romantic. Romantic, casual, hero. No, romantic, casual, villain, or default. Default, villain,

285
00:58:35,369 --> 00:58:42,809
casual, romantic. This is it. I'm not changing this for the rest of the game. You guys get to

286
00:58:42,809 --> 00:58:46,329
decide. And I know a lot of people are going to be mad at this because you're probably picking

287
00:58:46,329 --> 00:58:58,809
the, wow. Actually, nevermind. I'm not going to say anything. Damn. Geez. Okay. I'm not going

288
00:58:58,809 --> 00:59:06,059
to say anything. I don't want to influence the vote. There are actually five options for polls.

289
00:59:06,059 --> 00:59:14,900
Yeah, but I don't want to weigh this one anymore. It's all good. It's close, but I don't think it's

290
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:22,619
close enough. It's close, but not really. You got like five seconds before we were just going to do

291
00:59:22,619 --> 00:59:31,909
what we were going to do. 46% to 41% default versus romantic. You have literally three seconds.

292
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:44,679
Default wins. Thanks for playing. All right. Next, very important. Sunglasses on or off?

293
00:59:45,559 --> 00:59:49,880
Sunglasses on or off for the final arc of the rest of the game. On or off? Sunglasses on or

294
00:59:49,880 --> 01:00:04,969
off? It's very important. Plus, you know, this gives me a few minutes to take a sip of my drink

295
01:00:04,969 --> 01:00:26,380
and buy some lip balm. Sunglasses on or off? Still close. Very close. Wow. The people want default.

296
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:32,409
Default. Everything default. Interesting. I guess it makes sense. There's only so much,

297
01:00:32,409 --> 01:00:36,090
I guess, of the comedy outfits if you really want to see kind of how it plays out in the end of the

298
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:47,429
game. Yeah. Sunglasses off has kind of run away with it here. I don't think it's possible.

299
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:56,039
Almost 60% of the vote is for off. Sorry, everybody. Well, I apologize. A majority of you,

300
01:00:56,039 --> 01:01:01,530
or at least a larger percentage of you want me to turn it off. All right, we're going default.

301
01:01:02,409 --> 01:01:07,610
Now we have only two more things to care about. Ashley's costume for the rest of the game.

302
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:19,539
Default, casual, or romantic? Only three options here. Default. Stay with casual. Change back to

303
01:01:19,539 --> 01:01:53,719
romantic. Make your choice. Romantic. Casual. Default. This is very split. Everyone has poor

304
01:01:53,719 --> 01:02:02,940
taste. Well, here's the thing. It's spread out pretty evenly. So you all, you all disagree evenly.

305
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:16,199
It's like 40%, 20%, 37%. You guys seem to be equally in disagreement. So it's going to be close.

306
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:34,440
All right. That's it. Default. All right. The final decision you have to make is

307
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:39,559
Ashley's accessories. Default is sweeping, by the way. I'm just telling you.

308
01:02:40,679 --> 01:02:48,150
No accessories. Just default, classic, nothing. Red hair, the Wellington glasses, or the mask.

309
01:02:48,869 --> 01:03:03,219
Just go full on nothing. Just classic. Red hair, glasses, or mask. This one I'm actually interested

310
01:03:03,219 --> 01:03:14,070
in. Wow. Default sweep. It's not even close. Actually, wait a minute. It is close. It is close.

311
01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:20,389
Hold on. It's close. Red hair is really starting to come up here. This is too close to call now.

312
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:32,619
Uh-oh. Default has lost the race so far. Default is losing. Default is losing. I would click on

313
01:03:32,619 --> 01:03:39,829
that button if you don't want to look at the thing you didn't want to see. I think red hair is,

314
01:03:39,829 --> 01:03:51,099
no, hold on. You got like 10 seconds. Stop influencing. I saw what was happening,

315
01:03:51,099 --> 01:03:55,260
so I started saying both of them. Default looks pretty cool. Red hair looks pretty cool,

316
01:03:55,260 --> 01:04:02,889
right? Doesn't it? Which one? Either one. I don't know. Only one by about 100 votes.

317
01:04:03,769 --> 01:04:10,360
Red hair it is. And we're not doing the filters. I'm not playing with those on. There you go.

318
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:27,449
Default everything, but Ashley has a red hair now, I guess. Okay, let's go. Wait, what is this?

319
01:04:30,519 --> 01:04:39,780
Leatherjacket has contributed 550,000 channel points to that. Wait, what? What does that mean?

320
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:49,400
What does that mean? We enabled channel points to vote more. Oh, you can actually spend channel

321
01:04:49,400 --> 01:05:04,380
money to vote. I wanted default. Hey, come on. All right, we're good. I'm going to eat this egg.

322
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:19,900
It's rigged. We're, we're not going back. All right, let's go. Wait, she has her trust right

323
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:32,170
here. There's another one in the other room. What do you mean rigged? We're getting to the

324
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:54,150
scary part of the game and I need to focus because it's scary. Key card. How's the audio?

325
01:05:54,150 --> 01:06:42,889
We good? I'm gonna go this way first. I need a key card. Okay. Oh my God. I hate these things,

326
01:06:42,889 --> 01:07:33,219
but they do. I don't, I don't hear it yet. They do it. Oh, they do it. They do it. They do it in

327
01:07:33,219 --> 01:07:56,409
the remake too. Oh, I fucking hate it. I hate it. That, that. Oh, shut up. Okay. Dissection,

328
01:07:58,619 --> 01:08:03,179
override card for level two clearance using the machine in the freezer. So I have to go to the

329
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:25,989
dissection, come to the freezer, scan it, and then some, somebody help me. Now we're going to go up

330
01:08:25,989 --> 01:08:45,000
here. Wait, I'm, I am fucked here. I'm just realizing right now. I'm realizing right now

331
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:51,720
what's going on. Those of you that played the game before, how am I going to do this? I'm,

332
01:08:51,720 --> 01:09:01,000
I fucked everything up big time. Oh, this is a disaster actually. How am I going to reliably

333
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:10,859
do this? Honestly, this is going to be my solution. It's going to have to be. I don't have a rifle.

334
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:46,810
It's going to have to be this. You know what I'm talking about. What do I do here? Is that on?

335
01:09:46,810 --> 01:10:09,020
Right? That's on, right? Oh, I got to power both of them. I fucking hate using A and D. I just want

336
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:19,510
to use up or like W or use the mouse scroll. That's it, right? I got both of them on. How do I?

337
01:10:19,510 --> 01:10:37,800
Yeah, two to two. That's it, right? Do I have to like activate it? Confirm it. Oh, okay. System

338
01:10:37,800 --> 01:11:00,020
restored. I am so screwed. At last I have created new life. I call it the regenerator.

339
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:05,619
It's metabolic capacity is incredible. Unless all the parasites residing within the organism

340
01:11:05,619 --> 01:11:13,220
are destroyed, its tissue can regenerate indefinitely. Upon examining the body with a

341
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:18,020
biosensor scope, I was able to confirm that the parasites behave like vital organs for the host,

342
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:25,739
almost as though it has multiple hearts. This new creation of mine is essentially immortal.

343
01:11:25,739 --> 01:11:29,739
Surely even Dr. Frankenstein himself would want to shake my hand in admiration.

344
01:11:31,770 --> 01:11:46,300
And then it fucking killed him. So for those of you that don't know, I'm just going to,

345
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:49,500
I know it's a spoiler, but I know the spoiler. So I'm just going to tell you what it is.

346
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:57,020
I can't see through their bodies. And you normally can, if you get this scope to do it.

347
01:11:57,020 --> 01:12:10,810
And I'm not going to be able to, because I don't have a rifle. I'm in trouble. Or am I,

348
01:12:10,810 --> 01:12:53,979
or am I actually in trouble? What's wrong with this? Oh my God, dude. That was the worst fucking

349
01:12:53,979 --> 01:12:58,140
scare I think I had in like a year. And that was, I like knew it was going to happen to that fucked

350
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:04,840
up my whole brain. Oh my God, that was bad. Wow. Why was it that one? Why was it? I knew, I did,

351
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:10,760
he, I knew he was coming, but I thought it was slower than that. I thought it was much slower

352
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:14,520
than that. It was the fact, there was a lot of things going on there. First of all, I thought

353
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:18,840
that I had the key card and I was going to swipe it, but I didn't. I don't have the key card. And

354
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:27,060
then I looked down the hallway. He wasn't there. Nice fake YouTube jumpscare. It wasn't. It was

355
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:33,399
real. Um, but a lot of factors there. There really were a lot of factors on that. I looked

356
01:13:33,399 --> 01:13:36,920
down the hallway and there was nothing there. And then I, he turned around. There was immediately

357
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:41,770
somebody right there. This doesn't have power either. What, what actually does have power right

358
01:13:41,770 --> 01:14:06,810
now? Oh, I'm in trouble. I'm going to have to, you can't come in here, but where is he? I can't go in

359
01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:17,619
the freezer. I can't go in here. So I need to go down here. Okay. So I got to go left, right, right.

360
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:23,590
Buy a rifle right now. Let me see that scare. I want to see how embarrassing it was. I mean,

361
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:35,750
it was probably really embarrassing. What's wrong with this? What's wrong with this?

362
01:14:37,029 --> 01:14:43,960
That really does look like a YouTube thumbnail. It's, he's grabbing, he's got his hands locked

363
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:56,069
around my head and it's screaming. My limiter, my limiter on my microphone was working over time

364
01:14:56,069 --> 01:15:23,060
on that one, by the way. He doesn't sell it, does he? I thought he sold it. Go get the SMG

365
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:29,350
in the freezer. Oh shit. I know you're right. Okay. Okay. I thought I was screwed for a second.

366
01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:40,250
All right. I'm going to heal full health with the bass and just run. Oh, I need to do this.

367
01:15:54,600 --> 01:16:06,090
It was so loud. I just, whatever. I don't think any of this really matters right now.

368
01:16:09,079 --> 01:16:21,689
I guess I'll put on the, this, get the rifle. I don't have the money for the rifle.

369
01:16:22,170 --> 01:16:28,710
I'll be all right. I just have to, I just have to get to where I need to go and I'm just going to

370
01:16:28,710 --> 01:16:34,659
run. I'm going to save it right here. I knew I was going to hate this part. It's just me remembering

371
01:16:34,659 --> 01:17:40,579
how much I hated this when I was younger. Okay. It's left, right, right. Go. Okay. Left and then

372
01:17:40,579 --> 01:18:11,539
straight across. Oh, there's more than one. Oh, and I have two to deal with this too. I have to deal

373
01:18:11,539 --> 01:18:30,020
with this now. I have to, I have to deal with this. Did I get them all? I got them all. I got

374
01:18:30,020 --> 01:19:05,619
them all. 28 slugs, Steven. It was worth it. I got rid of all the parasites. That's going to have

375
01:19:05,619 --> 01:19:19,050
to be the play if I don't get the scope. There's another one just hanging out here. Okay. I got

376
01:19:19,050 --> 01:20:18,100
three to power. Come on. I got to get that last one. There it is. Oh boy. I got it. Ooh, an LE5.

377
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:37,399
There it is. And I can put the scope on this. Where do I get that scope though? I don't know

378
01:20:37,399 --> 01:20:51,909
where I get the scope. So you get it later. Okay. So now I got to go. I have level two.

379
01:20:51,909 --> 01:20:59,640
So level two gets me to the down here. So I need to power this back up over here. Go back to this

380
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:04,970
room, switch it back to here, and then go here. All right. So I don't want to fight this thing.

381
01:21:04,970 --> 01:21:10,859
So I'm going to go straight left straight, which maybe I should just kill it. I'm just going to

382
01:21:10,859 --> 01:21:38,470
kill it. I've got, I've got my, I'm going for it again. Thank God. Okay. All right. All right. I

383
01:21:38,470 --> 01:21:46,180
don't, I'm good. I ran out of bullets, but that's all right. That's exactly why I wanted to have

384
01:21:46,180 --> 01:21:54,359
that weapon. That weapon is precisely what I wanted to do with it. Okay. So now I got to go

385
01:21:54,359 --> 01:22:16,970
back around here. How are this? Another one's probably going to spawn. Now I got to go back

386
01:22:16,970 --> 01:22:45,539
around here and then that is the end of that. Okay. This is it. Can I, can I have an egg? Can

387
01:22:45,539 --> 01:22:55,859
I have an egg, please? Just give me one egg. That's all I want. What the fuck is going on?

388
01:22:55,859 --> 01:23:06,699
Wait, what? Wasn't this powering over here? And I switched it to be powering over here. No,

389
01:23:06,699 --> 01:23:10,460
it was already pop. Oh, I thought I had to put it. I thought the power was this.

390
01:23:10,460 --> 01:23:15,720
And then the second power was over here. Oh shit. I turned it off. I thought it was,

391
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:33,829
but it was whatever. No eggs. Okay. All right. Yeah. That's, that's what I could look at the

392
01:23:33,829 --> 01:23:42,779
map though. It doesn't look like it's, um, yeah, like this is now powered down. Oh no, it's not

393
01:23:42,779 --> 01:24:00,539
shit. Okay. Okay. Something's going to jump scare me. It's going to be another one and I

394
01:24:00,539 --> 01:24:04,380
have to be ready and I can't use all of my shotgun bullets. It's going to the freezer again.

395
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:37,369
Just wait. Here comes something, right? You can hear it. Ah, I thought they were talking.

396
01:24:37,930 --> 01:25:32,789
Where are they? All right. Come on up here. Don't the fuck. Why is it making that weird

397
01:25:32,789 --> 01:25:54,329
like banger boys sound? Why is it doing that? Don't play Resident Evil 4 at 3 a.m.

398
01:25:54,329 --> 01:26:10,310
Yep. Fucking thumbnails, man. We like to party. We like, we like to party. We like to party.

399
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:22,680
That used to just absolutely amp everybody up big time when that song would play. Those of you that

400
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:26,439
were around and that song was really popular, you would hear that and it would be like,

401
01:26:27,609 --> 01:26:33,369
holy shit, it's about to get real. It's going to be an incredibly fun party right now.

402
01:26:36,390 --> 01:26:50,390
In mere moments, everyone's going to have a great time in moments, moments from now.

403
01:26:50,390 --> 01:26:56,359
Back during like a wedding, grandma and grandpa get up for that one too. You know, that, you know,

404
01:26:56,359 --> 01:26:59,479
grandma and grandpa kind of sitting there, you know, chilling out for most of the wedding. And

405
01:26:59,479 --> 01:27:09,000
then all of a sudden it's like, okay, I'm getting up for this one. And the grandma gets up. Grandpa

406
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:12,920
gets up. The whole family gets up. Every friend gets up. There's nobody sitting down when that

407
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:27,100
song was played. They all do the same like, it's just kind of like this up, like, let's go.

408
01:27:32,979 --> 01:27:59,479
I'm looking forward to being, to being that guy. Okay. Let's keep playing. What? Shit. Okay.

409
01:27:59,479 --> 01:28:45,029
They're all going to break out of here. So I am not fighting any more of these. What's this herb?

410
01:28:45,029 --> 01:29:05,140
That's my favorite color. Teal. During a recent power outage, a test subject awoke from cryogenic

411
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:12,199
status, broke out of his holding tank and escaped. The subject was contained after 20 hours,

412
01:29:12,199 --> 01:29:17,560
leaving seven dead and 19 wounded. We were unable to recover one of the bodies in a tool from inside

413
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:23,909
of it. Cause of this unfortunate incident is the unstable power supply. The outdated generators

414
01:29:23,909 --> 01:29:28,760
cannot keep up with our demanding schedule. Management must prioritize the needs of the

415
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:37,619
engineers of those of the researchers to prevent something that's ever happening again. Thank God.

416
01:29:42,409 --> 01:29:51,579
Thank God. Because now I can actually do this correctly. You see what's going on here?

417
01:29:55,420 --> 01:30:01,180
You don't know where they are in the body. That's why I was shooting at the shotgun. If these are

418
01:30:01,180 --> 01:30:06,619
not all destroyed at the same time, within a second or two of each other, they don't die.

419
01:30:17,079 --> 01:30:27,449
All right. Should I kill them? Can I kill them now? When they're inside of this or no? I feel

420
01:30:27,449 --> 01:30:52,859
like I probably should do it. I'm going to do it. This thing sucks. It has no power to die.

421
01:30:53,500 --> 01:31:10,649
This thing sucks. This thing doesn't hurt anything. Yeah. I have to, I have to go like

422
01:31:11,689 --> 01:31:17,739
to do one. I only have 30 bullets. What am I doing? What's your opinion on cheese?

423
01:31:18,460 --> 01:31:28,699
All right. Well, I got another, um, yeah, I am pulling this person right now.

424
01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:36,020
Where? Okay. So all of your, they're all in like this mid section area. Okay. I got it. Ready?

425
01:31:44,979 --> 01:32:14,069
Whoa. I get them all. I didn't get them all. Oh my God. That's it. That's it. That's it. Okay.

426
01:32:14,069 --> 01:32:22,680
You missed both of them. I don't know how I did that. Oh God. I hate this area so much.

427
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:29,880
I just, I just get so panicky and so high strung. What's going on? Oh, it's blocked.

428
01:32:30,520 --> 01:33:10,279
How do I unblock it? Why is it blocked up? That shit's all blocked up over here. Why can I use

429
01:33:10,279 --> 01:33:19,350
this? It's all blocked off. I need to like power it on. All right. There's the terminal key card

430
01:33:19,350 --> 01:33:48,310
lock down here. Maybe you only need to kill one of them. Read the note. Wait, what? So what? The

431
01:33:48,310 --> 01:34:07,770
tool. So what though? But we're good tool. Wait, what? What's going on? This is the tool. Grab the

432
01:34:07,770 --> 01:34:21,460
tool. What tool? They both died right here. There's nothing on the ground inside the enemy. There's

433
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:35,380
nothing on the ground. There are more. Oh, there are more. Oh, there are more. Oh, no, there are

434
01:34:35,380 --> 01:34:48,859
more. And there's the tool. There's the wrench that's inside of the person's stomach. I've been

435
01:34:48,859 --> 01:34:58,420
looking at it like this and there are two more and you, I am in a lot of trouble, but you know what?

436
01:34:58,420 --> 01:35:06,039
Let's make this happen correctly. No excuses. Do it. I got scared. I got scared and had to run.

437
01:35:13,739 --> 01:35:54,119
This weapon sucks, dude. Fuck off me. I want to fucking quit the game. I want to restart so bad.

438
01:35:54,680 --> 01:36:24,500
Fuck you. Let me stop pretending. Guys, I can't, I don't know where they are. And I'm, I didn't

439
01:36:25,060 --> 01:36:30,409
buy a, I didn't buy a rifle. So these bullets don't fucking hurt anything.

440
01:36:31,739 --> 01:36:35,020
So I have to see where the parasites are and then switch to a different weapon.

441
01:36:35,659 --> 01:36:51,939
I'm good. I got the tool. I'm good. There's something in here. You have no ammo. I'll be good.

442
01:36:52,659 --> 01:37:03,300
Don't worry. I'll be fine. It could go worse the next time. Where is this thing? It's like hanging

443
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:17,619
right here. I'll be good. Trust me. I'll be good. Oh, by the way, it turns out that everyone telling

444
01:37:17,619 --> 01:37:24,229
me that the deluxe edition had cheating maps was a liar because that's not real. You guys just made

445
01:37:24,229 --> 01:37:33,380
that up. So that's why I have been, I have not been buying the treasure maps because everyone

446
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:37,859
told me I was a cheater and I bought the deluxe edition, which gave me access to all the treasures

447
01:37:37,859 --> 01:37:40,579
and everyone was like, Oh, he's a cheater. And I was like, Oh, I don't have to buy those.

448
01:37:40,579 --> 01:37:49,180
Turns out that's not real. That's not accurate. Thank you for that one. All right. I got the tool.

449
01:37:50,060 --> 01:38:03,930
I got the treasure. You only had to kill one of these things. Yeah. But I was scared that they

450
01:38:03,930 --> 01:38:13,529
were going to all break out and it was going to open up and kill me. It was just for the first

451
01:38:13,529 --> 01:38:30,409
area. Yeah. I have to do this right. So bear with me here. This guy will do it for me.

452
01:38:31,050 --> 01:38:38,659
That hit me right in the head. How did you, how did they perfectly do that? That is so annoying

453
01:38:38,659 --> 01:38:50,680
right now. How did they do that? So flawlessly. Okay. That's what I wanted to do. Oh my God. I

454
01:38:50,680 --> 01:38:58,760
broke one out with the grenade. No, that's not good. That's very bad. That is exceptionally bad.

455
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:07,319
I have to kill this thing right now. Is it dead? Seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven.

456
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:57,619
Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Wait, I can, I can, I have an idea. Stop it. I'm dead. Throw it at me.

457
01:39:57,619 --> 01:40:08,729
Throw it. Dude, throw that at me already. Thank you. Jesus. This is a fucking disaster, dude. I

458
01:40:08,729 --> 01:40:15,270
really should just die. I should just die. This is a disaster. This is a fucking disaster.

459
01:40:16,149 --> 01:40:27,609
Just kill me. This is a disaster. I have no bullets. I opened up all four of those chambers.

460
01:40:27,609 --> 01:40:37,750
This is an absolute fucking disaster. You could leave. Yeah, but I used all my ammo. I just have

461
01:40:37,750 --> 01:40:46,569
to kill the one. Where am I? All right. Okay. We're good. Everybody relax. Everything is now

462
01:40:46,649 --> 01:40:53,369
situated. I don't have to waste like 200 rounds trying to shoot the stupid fucking parasites in

463
01:40:53,369 --> 01:41:19,340
their bellies. Okay. Here we go. There's ammo somewhere, isn't there? I know I picked it up.

464
01:41:19,340 --> 01:41:28,489
Where is it? Okay. I just have to get this right. I have to, with the 20 shots in this weapon that

465
01:41:28,489 --> 01:41:37,060
has no upgrades in it, I have to get, I have to kill this one person and then I'm going to run out

466
01:41:37,060 --> 01:41:52,180
of this room. Okay. We ready? No more messing around. No more bullshit. I'm doing this now.

467
01:41:52,819 --> 01:42:09,109
Can you play the song? Sure. I just typed in Vengaboy's song. It's probably going to be the

468
01:42:09,109 --> 01:42:25,430
first one. Yeah, it is. All right. I'm going to turn it down just a little bit. I'll activate

469
01:42:25,430 --> 01:42:43,029
the encounter and go, Oh, here comes grandma. I don't, why am I doing this? All right. Here we

470
01:42:43,029 --> 01:44:24,409
go. It's time to go. Watch out. Oh shit. Why is this to the beat of the song? What are you doing?

471
01:44:24,409 --> 01:45:13,479
Who's got me? Call me. The song didn't help. It made everything worse. You know what? Fuck it.

472
01:45:13,479 --> 01:45:19,369
I got an idea. I'm going to just, I'm just going to cause mayhem right now. I'm just going to go,

473
01:45:19,369 --> 01:45:28,180
I'm going full mayhem mode. Now, wait, maybe crazy frog will help. Not a bad idea. Not a bad idea.

474
01:45:28,180 --> 01:46:26,380
Crazy frog could help. It's not a bad option here. What's going on? I still want to shoot this.

475
01:46:26,939 --> 01:46:35,260
This is on the handgun. No, how do I put this down? Why is this even on the bar right now? Why is

476
01:46:35,260 --> 01:47:49,260
this on the bar? I'm fucking pissed now. Eat shit everybody. Where's the key? I don't care anymore.

477
01:47:49,260 --> 01:48:00,100
We're doing fucking relaxing music. Play peanut butter jelly. Oh, that's a good one too. That's

478
01:48:00,100 --> 01:48:15,859
right. I will beat it to one of these songs. I promise. All right. Peanut butter jelly song.

479
01:48:17,079 --> 01:48:24,939
All right. This is, I don't think this is it. This is not the peanut butter jelly song,

480
01:48:26,649 --> 01:48:41,350
but it's going to stay. Let's go.

481
01:48:41,350 --> 01:48:52,310
Peanut butter jelly. Then you take the peanuts and you mash them, you mash them, you mash them,

482
01:48:52,310 --> 01:49:01,510
mash them, mash them. Leon singing. Oh, you're fucking me up so bad.

483
01:49:06,899 --> 01:49:07,939
Leon is singing.

484
01:49:07,939 --> 01:49:25,779
Peanut butter jelly. No. God damn it. Die. Please.

485
01:49:31,159 --> 01:49:53,159
I can't do this. This song goes fucking hard by the way. Shit. No.

486
01:49:54,119 --> 01:49:59,239
Eat it, eat it, eat it. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I'm fucked here.

487
01:50:01,939 --> 01:50:06,579
Don't blow anything up. I have to go for it. All right. Quiet, quiet, quiet. That song was

488
01:50:06,579 --> 01:50:13,140
pretty cool, but all right. Hold on. I need to see where they are. All right. They're on the belly

489
01:50:13,140 --> 01:50:20,340
and then on the neck line. Belly, neck. And then on the neck, on the neck, on the neck.

490
01:50:25,659 --> 01:50:52,699
Just give me the key card and give me the fuck out of here. Go, go, go, go, go, go.

491
01:50:55,260 --> 01:51:13,479
Peanut, peanut butter. The fact that people say that was Leon singing made that a hundred

492
01:51:13,479 --> 01:51:29,779
fucking times funnier. Okay. I need to go back for the items. It was Ashley too. Oh, that's so

493
01:51:29,779 --> 01:52:13,399
fucking funny. That's so stupid. Whatever, whatever, whatever. It doesn't matter. We're gone.

494
01:52:13,399 --> 01:52:31,180
I missed a, an error, but it's fine. It's okay. Peanut butter jelly song. That was not right,

495
01:52:31,180 --> 01:52:42,380
but it's okay. Peanut. You missed a lot more than that. I don't want to go back there.

496
01:52:42,380 --> 01:52:59,859
I really don't. There is handgun ammo down here though, which I will take. I think that's good.

497
01:53:02,020 --> 01:53:21,539
Yeah. Hold on. Yeah. Yes. Yes. All right. We can finally leave my, one of my least favorite zones.

498
01:53:21,539 --> 01:53:28,579
It does get worse though. If I remember it gets a little worse. What is this? What does this want

499
01:53:28,579 --> 01:53:43,659
me to do here? Gap in the wall. Oh, that's for when I think when Ashley's back. Yeah. Okay. Well,

500
01:53:43,659 --> 01:54:21,750
that was an interesting journey. That was fun. Yeah. The red hair is still there. It was voted on.

501
01:54:21,750 --> 01:54:33,130
Did it work? Having a leveled up rifle makes a huge difference here. Yeah. I got through it.

502
01:54:36,119 --> 01:54:40,359
I just shouldn't sell that gun because the regenerators are now enemies going forward.

503
01:54:41,239 --> 01:55:04,180
So I don't want to have to deal with that again. That's surprising considering how

504
01:55:04,180 --> 01:55:07,699
panicky I was with the shotgun. Although I guess the shotgun is hard to miss with.

505
01:55:07,699 --> 01:55:45,399
Getting close. Only a couple more chapters remain. Thank you. Can you stand? Where's Luis?

506
01:55:45,399 --> 01:56:01,289
He's worried about you till the end. Come on. We don't have much time. Let's get rid of these

507
01:56:01,289 --> 01:56:13,899
things for Luis. Let's go get that item. Yeah. Come in. There's a lab where we can remove the

508
01:56:13,899 --> 01:56:21,130
parasites. Had a crazy hunch that you'd know where it is. Their most important facilities are house

509
01:56:21,130 --> 01:56:31,909
and their sanctuary at the top of the mountain. That's where I'd look. Crystal ore? Crystal ore?

510
01:56:32,789 --> 01:56:39,689
What the hell is that? This is such a little book. How do you even write in this?

511
01:56:40,489 --> 01:56:48,810
This thing is tiny. We were imprisoned without warning. One by one we are taken to the next

512
01:56:48,810 --> 01:56:56,090
room. I do not know what happens there. They just took Annabelle. I'm probably next. I've got to

513
01:56:56,090 --> 01:57:02,020
think. Need to get my head straight. All who are infected with the plaga will be at the mercy of

514
01:57:02,020 --> 01:57:08,020
Lord Saddler. If he commands it, they will work. If he commands it, they will work themselves to

515
01:57:08,020 --> 01:57:12,680
death with a smile on their face. Adversely, the host becomes so simple-minded that they're

516
01:57:12,680 --> 01:57:18,760
basically useless for any complex task. However, we succeeded in developing the new superior

517
01:57:18,760 --> 01:57:24,359
species of plaga. It has no special variability. But the host's cognitive functions are not

518
01:57:24,359 --> 01:57:30,119
diminished. Seems like they plan to administer this new species to the girl. Clearly important

519
01:57:30,119 --> 01:57:35,640
that she maintains her intelligence after infection. All tests were successful and

520
01:57:35,640 --> 01:57:40,630
plans for mass production are moving forward. The project is a complete success. But I've been

521
01:57:40,630 --> 01:57:46,439
imprisoned. And preparations to inject me with the superior species are underway in the next room.

522
01:57:47,399 --> 01:57:53,479
Annabelle is not herself anymore. The smile has been wiped completely from her face. Writing is

523
01:57:53,479 --> 01:58:13,500
the only thing that keeps me sane now. Not that anyone will ever read this. Oh, it's another 100%

524
01:58:13,500 --> 01:58:27,909
heal. I kind of just fucked that up. But whatever. Doesn't matter. We're at the end game. Doesn't

525
01:58:27,909 --> 01:58:40,359
matter. Give me more than six. I got to replenish this. I have to use the bolt gun for a while now

526
01:58:40,359 --> 01:58:59,939
because I need to replenish the shotgun shells. Okay. Is grotto be shipping soon? Grotto beasts

527
01:58:59,939 --> 01:59:04,979
is shipping soon. I imagine a lot of people are going to start to in the first pass here,

528
01:59:05,539 --> 01:59:10,659
are going to start to get stuff within the next week or two. I'd be on the lookout if you ordered

529
01:59:10,659 --> 01:59:18,600
very early in the presale. Stuff is going to start shipping here really soon. So I would just be on

530
01:59:18,600 --> 01:59:37,500
the lookout over the next week or two, I'd say. Take a look. It is dropping soon. Okay, there we

531
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:58,380
go. Blue hair. Blue hair versus red hair. Can we get a vote, please? Are we changing from red to

532
01:59:58,380 --> 02:00:14,020
blue? Yes or no. You're going to need to make this decision very quickly. Blue medallions in here.

533
02:00:14,020 --> 02:00:24,520
They're scattered around. Okay. Oh, there's a shooting range. Nice. Okay, cool.

534
02:00:33,350 --> 02:00:50,380
Some powder. What the hell just happened to my voice? I got a purple gem, didn't I? All right,

535
02:00:50,380 --> 02:01:03,909
how close am I to doing this? Pull everything out. Red. Oh, red's the cheapest. Pull that out.

536
02:01:06,630 --> 02:01:17,180
So yellow, blue, purple, red, green. I need a red and a green one and I can do another crown for

537
02:01:17,180 --> 02:01:47,300
100k. I got this. I have a lot of coins already. I need way more squares. I don't need these

538
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:54,869
anymore, right? That's the reason why they're here. Wow, blue. Absolutely destroyed. Okay,

539
02:01:58,460 --> 02:02:16,229
I'll do that real quick right now. Real quick. Where's the... All right, blue hair. You can do

540
02:02:16,229 --> 02:02:26,439
it without leaving? I don't think you can. I think we tried before. Blue hair. Let's go.

541
02:02:28,710 --> 02:02:48,810
The accessories. Ah, okay. You can't do the clothing. You ready for the reveal? Okay. Miku.

542
02:02:51,109 --> 02:02:56,140
All right, we... This is upgraded all the way.

543
02:03:06,760 --> 02:03:13,100
Try that on for size. Once we get this thing all the way, we'll be good.

544
02:03:14,460 --> 02:03:18,970
Wait, you got new stuff? What do you got? Resources. I need these.

545
02:03:20,020 --> 02:03:25,819
You get some bet I don't come back. Shit, I need more gunpowder.

546
02:03:28,779 --> 02:04:00,600
Let's do this. New game. Okay, 4A, Punisher and the Riot Gun, Bolt Thrower, and then everything.

547
02:04:00,600 --> 02:04:29,930
Oh, dear. Okay. So, what... I got... Sorry. Do they ever connect all the way?

548
02:05:01,689 --> 02:05:13,640
How do you... I need to... I didn't know... I'm just trying to figure out how to... I don't even know

549
02:05:13,640 --> 02:05:21,739
the fuck that was happening. It's the first time I've ever seen it. It's the first time... Oh, please.

550
02:05:22,460 --> 02:05:26,739
Hey, Jerma, it's the first time you've ever seen this. How come you didn't get it the first time?

551
02:05:26,739 --> 02:05:59,770
It's annoying. Stop reloading when you don't need to. What do I even have the shotgun for?

552
02:06:00,329 --> 02:06:50,869
What's the bonus condition? What the hell was that? What the hell are you talking about?

553
02:06:51,430 --> 02:07:02,890
Why is there so much travel time on them in this mini-game? There's not that much travel time on

554
02:07:02,890 --> 02:07:12,739
this. Dude, there ain't this... I swear to God, there's not this much travel time on these bullets.

555
02:07:25,939 --> 02:07:34,039
Dude, what is going on? This thing doesn't suck this much in real life. Like, in the real game.

556
02:07:34,600 --> 02:08:07,619
Am I wasting these or do I get an infinite amount of these? I have no idea. I'm not wasting... Okay,

557
02:08:07,619 --> 02:08:18,390
I get four. All right, all right, all right. I don't care about getting... No, no, no, no, no,

558
02:08:18,710 --> 02:08:46,819
just do it. I don't care. It's moving. That was pretty good. That's probably a... It's taking us.

559
02:08:46,819 --> 02:08:53,989
All right, we're good. We're good. We're good. This one's going to be horrible. So I'm just going

560
02:08:53,989 --> 02:09:29,930
for like a B on this one. I'm going for a B on this one. Oh, my God. Wait, it's not... I don't like

561
02:09:29,930 --> 02:09:35,159
switching weapons. Just give me one. I hate switching weapons. It's like the worst. I don't

562
02:09:35,159 --> 02:09:44,779
care about any of this. I hate switching weapons. I didn't even know that could be... I just haven't

563
02:09:44,779 --> 02:10:10,229
used the rifle the whole game. I didn't know you could do that. I want to hit two. My fingers are

564
02:10:10,229 --> 02:10:35,800
so huge. They just hit every button when I press three. Use a machine gun. I don't even care.

565
02:10:35,800 --> 02:10:46,229
I just want to get a silver coin. I'm not doing this. I don't care. Just give me a fucking A.

566
02:10:46,229 --> 02:10:51,430
I don't care. B. I don't care. Good. Let's go. That's fine. I am not doing that ever again.

567
02:10:52,680 --> 02:10:58,039
You know what the problem is? So on a mechanical keyboard, the buttons are spaced out. So this is

568
02:10:58,920 --> 02:11:05,699
a mechanical keyboard. There's like a huge gap between every single button on a mechanical keyboard.

569
02:11:05,699 --> 02:11:14,949
I get stuck in the middle. I'll go to press three and I'll go in the middle. I need a mesh keyboard.

570
02:11:14,949 --> 02:11:23,260
I'm not a gamer anymore. Give me my mesh keyboard back. Give me a mesh keyboard. This doesn't happen.

571
02:11:23,260 --> 02:11:43,220
All right. This is the last time we're probably going to be able to do this. That's pretty good.

572
02:11:43,220 --> 02:11:53,140
It would have been nice a lot earlier. Let's conserve them now. Conserve it. Legendary.

573
02:11:53,140 --> 02:12:46,680
Legendary. No. No. Oh, that's actually great. That's really good. That's actually exactly what

574
02:12:46,680 --> 02:12:57,609
I wanted because now I have two shotgun crafting things. All right. I'll take it. I don't want I

575
02:12:57,609 --> 02:13:05,619
got S's on every single one except the last three or the last two. You look flustered. No, I'm just

576
02:13:05,619 --> 02:13:21,850
I'm just I just have a red. I just have blood in my face. All right. Does he sell gunpowder?

577
02:13:21,850 --> 02:13:25,939
I want the case that drops more gunpowder. I think I might already even have it on.

578
02:13:26,100 --> 02:13:45,319
Do I have the money one? Let's see. That's already on for gunpowder. So I have a 35% chance to get

579
02:13:45,319 --> 02:13:56,600
more shotgun ammo, which is a big deal in the melee crit. Do you have anything? You have these.

580
02:14:07,930 --> 02:14:22,579
I need square gems very badly. I have a question. Should I sell the bolt thrower now

581
02:14:23,140 --> 02:14:29,739
and go all into the broken butterfly? It actually might be time to get rid of this

582
02:14:30,300 --> 02:14:33,340
because I'm I don't I haven't upgraded in a while. I haven't spent the

583
02:14:34,140 --> 02:14:41,899
the t-tas on it. So I do like it, but I kind of let it fall off a little bit, didn't I?

584
02:14:43,560 --> 02:14:53,510
Yeah, I let it fall off. I'm going to sell it. It's going. It was fun. It's cool to

585
02:14:53,510 --> 02:15:14,520
new addition, but I want the money now. Oh, yeah. Molding a weapon to suit your specific.

586
02:15:14,520 --> 02:15:22,500
This kind of work is about finesse. Straight. Little bit goes a long way. Better to be over

587
02:15:22,500 --> 02:15:35,479
prepared. Am I right? Don't always have this in stock. Where would it? Pleasant trap. OK,

588
02:15:36,579 --> 02:15:52,789
I just need a bunch of gunpowder. This thing is empty. All right, we're good.

589
02:15:52,789 --> 02:16:06,789
Let me load this up and gun is good. All right. Sell the other charms. Sell your charms.

590
02:16:10,149 --> 02:16:15,829
Oh, these do sell for a lot. OK. Ruby's all rubbish. It makes no difference. So

591
02:16:16,550 --> 02:16:22,380
well, that's our choice to make. You can never hold more than one on anything anyway,

592
02:16:22,380 --> 02:16:50,420
so just sell the copies. OK, this helps. I probably should upgrade this.

593
02:16:52,100 --> 02:16:57,579
All the mines. Yeah, I can sell the mines too. Small key. Can I sell that? Why would I do that?

594
02:17:08,389 --> 02:17:17,659
There are no more locks. Oh, shit. OK. A deal well struck. All right. This is going to make

595
02:17:17,659 --> 02:17:26,200
this thing disgusting, but I really should level. I need to. I need to use this for a little while.

596
02:17:26,200 --> 02:17:38,360
So we're going probably ammo capacity or probably power. I'm going to do power. I think

597
02:17:38,920 --> 02:17:45,110
put it into the revolver. I'm going to make a lot more money soon. This is I need to use this

598
02:17:45,110 --> 02:17:51,659
now. Sell this and just buy the rifle. What can I do? Can I afford the right? How much is the rifle?

599
02:17:52,299 --> 02:17:55,420
Oh, it's only twelve thousand. All right. Wait, there's more than one rifle, isn't there?

600
02:17:57,059 --> 02:18:02,500
In your pocket or your I guess it's fine. Yeah, that's a good idea. All right. I'm going to get

601
02:18:02,500 --> 02:18:11,510
the rifle and I'm going to cancel because I need to sell that first anyway. Let me take the scope

602
02:18:11,510 --> 02:18:25,500
off of it. Get yourself killed. Stingray is better. It is better. I need thirty thousand. All right.

603
02:18:25,899 --> 02:18:40,620
Is what I've got. All right. We are good.

604
02:18:44,860 --> 02:18:53,690
I am not taking the regular scope. I'm going to put on this. How does it look?

605
02:19:08,059 --> 02:19:17,159
OK, very cool. We're good. Good strategy. I've got lots of good stuff. I am ready.

606
02:19:17,719 --> 02:19:29,540
I'm able. Let's go. I'm ready to go. I am tuned up. Where's the tuned? I'm ready.

607
02:19:29,540 --> 02:19:37,930
I am aware. I am a powerhouse. Welcome for a selection of good things on sale.

608
02:19:39,370 --> 02:20:02,489
What's that? Suit yourself, stranger. Let's go. Be careful, Ashley.

609
02:20:07,110 --> 02:20:12,340
Hmm. OK.

610
02:20:30,860 --> 02:20:45,590
You got to see on your awareness report card. I want to kill this guy without

611
02:20:45,590 --> 02:20:55,219
alerting everybody. That would be nice. Oh, there are five. All right. Remind me to do these.

612
02:21:05,059 --> 02:21:39,159
What's going on? Why is he still moving? Shut up. What is it hitting?

613
02:21:39,239 --> 02:22:06,170
Rumor said shut up right after I said sorry. What? I didn't tell you to shut up. OK, so there's one

614
02:22:06,170 --> 02:22:42,360
behind me over here. Up here, I think. Where is it? Like that way. Go up. And what do you think he

615
02:22:42,360 --> 02:22:56,549
smells like at this point? I smell just I just smell like a regular. I don't know. Got everything

616
02:22:56,549 --> 02:23:03,510
down here, I think. No, his handgun bullets. Those are up, though. I don't think I can get those.

617
02:23:04,069 --> 02:23:28,680
I have to get up there first. OK, that's better. Let's go. You look like you would smell like

618
02:23:28,680 --> 02:23:36,180
everything bagel seasoning. That sounds actually kind of good. And I don't have what's the problem

619
02:23:36,180 --> 02:24:16,340
there? Oh, shit. What's going on? I backed myself into such a corner here. Snap that guy right in

620
02:24:16,340 --> 02:24:25,379
the throat. OK, what about her? Ashley. I didn't shoot Ashley. That's why I was swinging the knife

621
02:24:25,379 --> 02:24:43,899
because I didn't want to hit her. I didn't want to shoot her. Really? No, I want square gems.

622
02:24:44,860 --> 02:25:03,510
Those are not square gems. Very frustrating. Does not open. This does not open either. It does.

623
02:25:05,110 --> 02:25:11,940
What the heck? They came from there. You know, BRB. Yeah, when I get to the end of this next

624
02:25:11,940 --> 02:25:29,670
chapter, I will be our be. Come on. Yes. Beautiful. Perfect. Replenishing. Yes. Very good. We're up

625
02:25:29,670 --> 02:25:55,100
28 shots now. That's a good thing. OK. Oh, actually, you do it. OK, that leads us back up here.

626
02:25:57,700 --> 02:26:25,399
Damn it. Where are you? What are you doing? Get over here. Come on.

627
02:26:41,739 --> 02:27:09,610
Oh, my God. It was so funny. Fuck. Fuck. I don't want to. She just got locked. Are you all right?

628
02:27:10,489 --> 02:27:31,290
That was a crowbar in the head. Watch out. Everything is good. Please move out of the way.

629
02:27:34,920 --> 02:27:43,340
All right. Now, this time I'm not going to screw this up. I got everything I did. All right. This

630
02:27:43,340 --> 02:28:08,790
time. So what? I tell her to run. Yes. All right. Still got eight. Very good. Now, I'm going to do

631
02:28:08,790 --> 02:28:17,989
this because that spawns a bunch of people, apparently. Like you do it. My problem was I

632
02:28:17,989 --> 02:28:52,139
jumped out. I should have just walked. Where are they? Fuck. What am I doing wrong? What happened?

633
02:28:53,100 --> 02:29:11,370
Wait. No, don't do this. Not right now. What the fuck did I just do? Damn it. I didn't even turn

634
02:29:11,370 --> 02:29:26,819
around once. I followed that guy up the stairs the whole time. Are you all right? OK. Now do it again.

635
02:29:29,770 --> 02:29:40,899
Is it just out? Wait, what? What was the point of doing all that? You can just go this way.

636
02:29:41,620 --> 02:30:13,510
Oh, because I unlocked it because it was locked before. I get it. We're good. Back up. Back up.

637
02:30:13,510 --> 02:30:22,280
This way. This way. Follow me. No, no, no. Come close. Oh, get off my face.

638
02:30:25,430 --> 02:30:30,840
You just walked into that Ashley and it would not have. She literally just walked into it almost.

639
02:30:30,840 --> 02:31:06,229
That's a lot of handgun ammo. Any reason to go down here? No. Oh, that isn't. Can you recap

640
02:31:06,229 --> 02:31:11,770
every joke? I was asleep. Um, it was the peanut butter jelly. There was a soundtrack to that

641
02:31:11,770 --> 02:31:19,540
crazy room. Then there was, um, that was probably it. You're up to speed now.

642
02:31:20,260 --> 02:31:37,670
I need two more still. Come on. There's going to be like alligators or something in here, isn't

643
02:31:37,670 --> 02:31:43,299
there? I don't remember. Yes. All right. I need one more of these and I got another 100k.

644
02:31:44,020 --> 02:31:53,700
I need a red one, right? Oh, the Roblox birthday party. Yeah, that was a really funny joke. That

645
02:31:53,700 --> 02:32:00,260
was a really good joke. That's right. That was a really good joke I was making. Exactly. I'm glad

646
02:32:00,260 --> 02:32:03,379
that you all we all agree on that because that doesn't really have to happen because it was a

647
02:32:03,379 --> 02:32:17,579
funny joke. Good. Very good. It's not a joke. Well, a lot of people just said it was. Ashley,

648
02:32:17,579 --> 02:32:27,540
how did you mess that up? Wait. Oh, I messed it up at the same time. Yeah. Okay. I pressed spacebar,

649
02:32:27,540 --> 02:33:29,590
not E. Wait here. I can hear it. I can hear it going. What the fuck are you talking about?

650
02:33:40,600 --> 02:34:08,840
What? What the hell is going on here? Oh, nice. I got, um, I got a, I got a hundred thousand dollars

651
02:34:08,840 --> 02:34:37,530
now. That's the upgraded regenerators. Yep. I forgot. Very scary. Get that lever. I pressed it.

652
02:34:37,530 --> 02:34:45,940
Is there a delay? E. There's a delay. There's a delay. There's like a full second delay. I

653
02:34:45,940 --> 02:35:35,940
didn't know that. Give me some space. Got it. I know there's another one. This thing has no power.

654
02:35:35,940 --> 02:36:10,309
Get this for me. Why couldn't I just do it? Why didn't I just do it? You gotta be ready for an,

655
02:36:10,309 --> 02:36:27,270
this is going to be like an attack or something. This is fully loaded, right? Yep.

656
02:36:27,270 --> 02:36:46,629
Ooh, I have so many of these. I really have so many. Okay. Good. Keep going.

657
02:37:26,620 --> 02:37:44,780
Power. Just checking. I don't want to miss anything. All right. Hold on.

658
02:37:44,780 --> 02:38:00,729
Full heal. I need a few more of those. All right. Let's do it. I know, I know it's coming.

659
02:38:00,729 --> 02:38:11,989
That opens. No, no, no. Don't use that. Don't use that. Don't use that. I gotta go. I gotta go. I

660
02:38:11,989 --> 02:38:23,659
gotta go. Oh God. Oh shit. Okay. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

661
02:38:23,659 --> 02:38:40,809
I gotta go right now. Hurry up. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no. Oh,

662
02:38:41,770 --> 02:38:59,100
stop doing that. Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Don't move.

663
02:38:59,739 --> 02:39:18,120
What are you doing? Oh, you're going to turn to the thing. Where is it?

664
02:39:22,459 --> 02:39:41,899
Ow. Jesus. Okay. Nice work. Very good. I missed a treasure, but what can you do?

665
02:39:41,899 --> 02:40:35,510
What can you do? That's okay. What can you do? Nah, what can you do? Sounds like you're at the

666
02:40:35,510 --> 02:40:50,379
grocery store. It kind of does, you know, but people are raging because I'm not taking like

667
02:40:50,379 --> 02:41:11,459
40 minutes on each puzzle now. I had breakfast this morning. Again, I had yogurt. I already

668
02:41:11,459 --> 02:41:18,360
told you I had yogurt. I had a piece of toast. I had a nice big glass of water. I almost lied

669
02:41:18,360 --> 02:41:21,719
instead of orange juice for no reason. I don't know why you would lie about something so stupid.

670
02:41:21,719 --> 02:41:45,770
Oh, rats. Oh, wait a minute. I don't think I got all these. I didn't. Okay.

671
02:41:45,930 --> 02:42:03,540
What can I do? Let's do it. Here we go. We've got red, green, $100,000. Now this one can do this.

672
02:42:06,629 --> 02:42:20,549
$27,000. This one started. Very good. This one cannot be started, but we're making a lot of

673
02:42:20,549 --> 02:42:58,569
money now. $100,000. $27,000. Here it is. This thing now will be doing like 40 per shot.

674
02:42:58,569 --> 02:43:16,520
It's a good idea. You don't even use it. When I press this button, it is now going to be on

675
02:43:16,520 --> 02:43:22,600
my hot bar and it will be used at every major boss encounter going forward. I'm worried.

676
02:43:23,639 --> 02:43:31,159
We're good. All right. In the meantime, I don't think I'm going to be able to get a ticket,

677
02:43:31,159 --> 02:43:39,260
so I'm going for it. Do it. This thing is ridiculous.

678
02:43:57,940 --> 02:44:06,600
Oh, I'm going to buy. You still have those dirt. No, you don't. Okay. Where is the

679
02:44:07,479 --> 02:44:16,940
Magnum is already here. And how many shots do I have with this? I have 19 shots with this Magnum.

680
02:44:16,940 --> 02:44:37,819
There's a better Magnum. That's fine. This can stay the way it is. You're going to miss 19 times.

681
02:44:37,819 --> 02:44:48,420
Now that would be really funny, but I don't think so. I kept upgrading this just because

682
02:44:48,420 --> 02:44:53,700
it's good to have handguns doing just fine. It's all maxed out. Shotgun is maxed out,

683
02:44:55,049 --> 02:45:04,280
getting close 37 in one go. Okay. I think this is a major encounter. If let me just make sure

684
02:45:04,840 --> 02:45:14,120
take a sip. So I got the strategy guide down here. So it says that down here, Leon will be

685
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:22,920
ambushed by four major enemy types. One chainsaw enemy, one regenerator, one question mark,

686
02:45:22,920 --> 02:45:28,200
question mark, question mark, question mark. Guy doesn't even know. And one boss is what's down

687
02:45:28,200 --> 02:45:32,940
here. So if I jumped down here, let me make sure you can see. Yeah. Right here. I want what the

688
02:45:32,940 --> 02:45:44,020
question mark is. Why would they not say that in the guide? That's weird. My ear is really itchy.

689
02:45:59,739 --> 02:46:09,670
That's a lift. You might be the only person that needs a maxed out broken butterfly on

690
02:46:09,670 --> 02:46:15,139
standard difficulty. What do you, what would it say? I need this. I just think it's fun to do.

691
02:46:17,540 --> 02:46:21,219
Well, wait, why do you think I'm like, I'm doing that? Cause I feel like I need to do that.

692
02:46:22,469 --> 02:46:25,750
I don't need the broken butterfly. It's just a fun thing to upgrade.

693
02:47:09,909 --> 02:47:19,110
Why would driver's ed make you able to drive a wrecking ball? All you did is piss the building

694
02:47:19,110 --> 02:47:34,420
off. You just hit the building on the side and made it scream. What are you swinging at?

695
02:47:34,420 --> 02:48:08,379
Where are you going? What is he talking about? Open the window. Oh my goodness. That's a lot of

696
02:48:08,379 --> 02:48:34,059
shit. What's that? Oh shit. I just like watched him do that. Hey, God damn it. I tried to.

697
02:48:34,059 --> 02:49:00,860
That guy just landed on his neck. There's too many things happening yet. Where is that little

698
02:49:00,860 --> 02:49:45,059
bug? Shit. Actually break the wall. She is actually stop. Stop. We need to think of a different way.

699
02:49:50,299 --> 02:50:23,510
I'm fine. I'm fine. Oh God. Oh God. What do you mean help? Oh my God. What is fucking happening?

700
02:50:24,309 --> 02:51:08,469
Somebody is beating the shit out of me with a club and I don't fuck off. Nice. All right. Collect.

701
02:51:08,469 --> 02:51:26,219
I think I got everything. Most things. There's a lot of money over here. Wait, there's a lot of

702
02:51:26,219 --> 02:51:43,819
money. That was pretty cool. Actually. You ever feel like a plastic bag? Yeah, actually sometimes

703
02:51:44,379 --> 02:52:03,299
I don't think I can get the other two. Get this one. Last one is all the way across here.

704
02:52:04,020 --> 02:52:34,409
I wonder where. Down there. Maybe I can still get it. Okay, let's go. You could go back and get it.

705
02:52:34,409 --> 02:52:42,760
No, I got everything upgraded. I'm good. Pretty much this is what I have for the end game anyways.

706
02:52:43,500 --> 02:52:54,819
Maxed out shotgun. Maxed out handgun. Maxed out magnum. There's a shortcut right here. Wait,

707
02:52:54,819 --> 02:53:13,579
really? You mean like you're here? Oh, yeah, you're right. Okay, so that's the shortcut to

708
02:53:13,579 --> 02:53:22,680
get right here. So then with this map, there's bullets. Where are these bullets? Where are these

709
02:53:22,680 --> 02:54:08,120
bullets? Where are these bullets? In the trash. I thought you meant like in a dumpster. Very cool.

710
02:54:08,120 --> 02:54:18,469
Let's move on. There have been sightings of what appears to be a strange corpse wandering around,

711
02:54:18,469 --> 02:54:50,620
likely the result of some immoral experiment in the incubation lab. Do it or coward. Do it.

712
02:54:52,520 --> 02:54:56,920
Do it. Do it. It's with the regenerators. Do it. Do it. It's going to be an omega regenerator.

713
02:54:56,920 --> 02:55:16,280
It's my least favorite enemy in the game. All right. Fine. We're at the end anyways. Yeah,

714
02:55:16,280 --> 02:55:24,020
that's right. It's true. I really don't want to go back here and do this, but I'm going to.

715
02:55:31,590 --> 02:55:56,500
It is. Emerald can go in here now. Very good. All right. Down in the incubation lab,

716
02:55:56,500 --> 02:56:02,090
straight through here, left, left. I need to save it first. I don't want to. I'm going to

717
02:56:02,090 --> 02:56:14,040
blow through all my ammo. It's going to be a disaster. Have you seen One Piece? I've seen

718
02:56:14,040 --> 02:56:19,930
random episodes of One Piece, but I don't. I haven't really cared to sit down and watch that

719
02:56:19,930 --> 02:56:27,030
much of it. I've just seen random episodes on TV, just like scrolling around. My problem with One

720
02:56:27,030 --> 02:56:33,190
Piece is isn't it still not done? And it's the manga has been going for like 30 years and there's

721
02:56:33,190 --> 02:56:48,979
like 1500 volumes. It's like, where do I even start with that? Only five more years. Hey,

722
02:56:48,979 --> 02:56:56,459
I'll tell you though, that's kind of lifelong media, isn't it? If you were a fan of One Piece,

723
02:56:57,020 --> 02:57:03,500
10 plus years ago, you still get to enjoy it. It's still going. You still get to enjoy. Is

724
02:57:03,500 --> 02:57:06,700
there going to be a thing you can kind of pay attention to sometimes? That's kind of cool.

725
02:57:07,500 --> 02:57:43,719
Yeah, that thing's not dead. It is. Oh my God. This thing. Look at how many things. Stop doing

726
02:57:43,719 --> 02:58:13,059
that. One more, one more, one more in the head. Ooh, that's it. Right. Nice. This is a bad idea,

727
02:58:13,059 --> 02:58:36,260
but I'm gonna do it. I don't care. Ruby. I just wanted the Ruby. You're wasting ammo. I'm all

728
02:58:36,260 --> 02:58:48,280
right. All right. That's all right. I got a Ruby. Kill the others. All this. Okay. I think I can

729
02:58:48,280 --> 02:59:17,319
handle this. Ready? What the fuck? Die. All right. It was worth it. It was worth it. It was worth it.

730
02:59:19,209 --> 02:59:28,979
I got two gems for that. It's fine. I'm good. Dude, the shotgun. I shoot like three times in

731
02:59:28,979 --> 02:59:37,420
that area and it doesn't even kill the parasite. It's a lot of dog shit. All right. Let's get back

732
02:59:37,420 --> 03:00:10,329
here. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. There's the, there's that back over here and then bang a left

733
03:00:14,340 --> 03:00:17,299
up ladder. No, no, no, no. It's just right through.

734
03:00:24,309 --> 03:00:31,270
Nice work. Got a selection of good things on sale. What should I even get at this point?

735
03:00:31,270 --> 03:00:41,930
Velvet blues. Money. This is limitless. I could just get a ton of these.

736
03:00:45,159 --> 03:00:57,579
One each to do. I don't really care about this anymore. All the velvet blues are that's going

737
03:00:57,579 --> 03:01:07,700
to give me like 20, like at least grab the ticket. Nah. Get the funny scope. Nah. Punisher. Nah.

738
03:01:07,700 --> 03:01:16,469
I'm just going to buy a shitload of these. Sell them. I'll get the map and then I'll get a bunch

739
03:01:16,469 --> 03:01:52,600
of these. Hell yeah. Very good. 46k. Am I at the point where I should just start selling the gems

740
03:01:52,680 --> 03:02:08,469
because I didn't find the other items? Not yet. This is good. All right. I do want to buy,

741
03:02:09,829 --> 03:02:13,899
I should probably get this. That's the last upgrade for the case.

742
03:02:18,100 --> 03:02:21,940
Then we're going to do, I don't know, maybe just just do power. Maybe

743
03:02:21,940 --> 03:02:27,579
tuned weapon can make up for a lack of skill. Yeah. Just do power.

744
03:02:34,500 --> 03:02:41,639
All right. Looking good. I need rifle ammo, but I think I can craft it actually.

745
03:02:41,639 --> 03:03:30,950
I can. No, don't do that yet. Now I'll do it. Your body armor. I just upgraded it.

746
03:03:32,069 --> 03:03:46,600
It's already broken already. I am molding. Sorry. All right. Let's go. Whoa.

747
03:03:47,639 --> 03:04:36,790
Oh, it added it to the map, but where is it? Nice. Wait, I could do too. Okay. That's fun.

748
03:04:36,790 --> 03:05:15,670
Let's go. No more stalling. First, we have to make it out of here.

749
03:05:19,079 --> 03:05:30,170
I did not want to press the fucking button again. I wanted to press W,

750
03:05:30,729 --> 03:05:39,770
but I went in the middle of the key. I didn't. I pressed E instead of W because I just have never

751
03:05:39,770 --> 03:05:43,930
learned where they are because if you have a keyboard, it's just spread out and I can't even.

752
03:05:44,569 --> 03:05:52,409
It's just my fingers try to find E and it's, there's a big space here and I just mushed in the

753
03:05:52,409 --> 03:06:36,120
middle. I'm going to get my mesh keyboard back. Nothing in here. Yes, there is.

754
03:06:37,750 --> 03:06:48,579
One of the things they say in the original, they go, and the music goes,

755
03:06:51,299 --> 03:07:06,870
I must stress the use of extreme caution when handling the amber deposits from underneath

756
03:07:06,870 --> 03:07:12,299
the castle. Work with the utmost respect and obedience. It is imperative that you do not

757
03:07:12,299 --> 03:07:32,920
disturb the holy body's slumber. Treasures in here. This must be what Luis was talking about.

758
03:07:32,920 --> 03:07:58,040
You. Damn, that thing's probably worth a lot. Nice. Crystal ore.

759
03:08:00,299 --> 03:08:05,579
Dearest Lord Saddler, I am overjoyed to report wonderful news. Production of the superior species

760
03:08:05,579 --> 03:08:11,540
of Las Plagas is officially underway. If all goes accordingly, rest assured that we will reach our

761
03:08:11,540 --> 03:08:16,739
ultimate goal. The Plaga is a truly magnificent organism that has the capacity to live in any

762
03:08:16,739 --> 03:08:23,670
vertebrae, be it human, dog, or even crow. There is no other parasite like it on earth. The superior

763
03:08:23,670 --> 03:08:29,590
species is particularly impressive as it can assimilate with a host without causing any damage

764
03:08:29,590 --> 03:08:35,129
to the brain. No one can oppose the strength of your dominance, my Lord. On the contrary,

765
03:08:35,129 --> 03:08:40,329
who would resist once they experience the utter joy that accompanies the absence of free will?

766
03:08:40,329 --> 03:08:44,940
I'm living proof how ignorant I once was. In a few days, I will have finished

767
03:08:44,940 --> 03:08:51,370
administrating the Plaga to all the high-ranking researchers, and then they too shall know. And

768
03:08:51,370 --> 03:09:15,379
when your plan is complete, the whole world shall know. The head researcher. Project. Don't touch

769
03:09:15,379 --> 03:09:21,540
that.

770
03:10:03,690 --> 03:10:15,860
Obey. Obey the voice of our Lord. I feel like, uh, uh-oh.

771
03:10:30,139 --> 03:10:36,149
Thank God she's a really bad shot with this. Or she's a really good shot.

772
03:10:36,149 --> 03:10:56,680
I can see this. My faithful disciple shall deliver to you your pennies. Now, child,

773
03:10:56,680 --> 03:11:03,620
you need not be afraid. Submit your body and release yourself from fear.

774
03:11:04,500 --> 03:11:17,000
Hell's Kitchen. Stop ruining cutscenes.

775
03:11:17,719 --> 03:11:55,540
Okay. I got everything in here, didn't I? Yes, I did. Let's go.

776
03:12:03,909 --> 03:12:15,000
All right. I have enough loaded, don't I? Which way does this go?

777
03:12:15,000 --> 03:12:33,129
It can go both ways, but I'll go this way first. Good.

778
03:12:33,129 --> 03:12:49,750
For your request, redevelopment of the island is well underway. Weapons and other defensive

779
03:12:49,750 --> 03:12:54,120
equipment have been set to guard against any outside intruders. By the time we are finished,

780
03:12:54,120 --> 03:12:59,350
the island will be a giant fortress. Very cool. These defenses won't hold up long term,

781
03:12:59,350 --> 03:13:26,540
but they should last until we carry out our plan. Where is this thing?

782
03:13:27,420 --> 03:13:39,610
I wonder how many of those I actually missed. Probably a few at this point, right?

783
03:13:40,250 --> 03:14:04,620
He didn't even see me. Stop. There's one per chapter. Huh. So I, yeah, so I missed a few.

784
03:14:04,620 --> 03:14:30,649
That's good to know for future playthroughs, though. So we'll see. 14k.

785
03:14:30,649 --> 03:14:34,329
I don't really need money for anything else besides a sniper rifle. I'm just gonna make

786
03:14:34,329 --> 03:15:04,090
sure I have enough going forward. When is BRB? Very soon. Want me to read it? Want me to read it?

787
03:15:04,170 --> 03:15:09,799
No. Yes. No. Yeah. No. Yeah. No. All right, we'll do the TLDR.

788
03:15:10,739 --> 03:15:13,459
Few people have heard of the name, even within the highest ranks of the U.S. Government. In

789
03:15:13,459 --> 03:15:24,280
little wonder, too, the operation was not made public. Operation Javier? Started back in 2002.

790
03:15:24,840 --> 03:15:33,180
I don't know if the mission was a failure. It shouldn't have been difficult to extract a single

791
03:15:33,180 --> 03:15:38,069
stranded unit. Why did it take so long? The U.S. Government let those people die,

792
03:15:38,069 --> 03:15:40,870
brave young people who dedicated their lives to protect the country.

793
03:15:40,870 --> 03:15:46,420
And I want to expose this crime. Operation Javier was written by an American journalist.

794
03:15:46,899 --> 03:15:57,430
I don't know if Jeremy doesn't read comments like, you've got a nice sheen today. I just did.

795
03:15:58,069 --> 03:17:07,770
That's me. Oh, no, it's Saw. He made a Saw trap for me. Hello again, Leon. Come on. So annoying.

796
03:17:07,770 --> 03:17:15,700
So annoying. It's so annoying. I haven't sneezed in like nine days. And every time I'm about to,

797
03:17:15,700 --> 03:17:21,909
when I want to do a stupid thing I want to do, it just stops. And I can usually look at the light.

798
03:17:21,909 --> 03:17:26,069
But the light's not on. The lights are off. So I have to look at the big ring light in the corner

799
03:17:26,069 --> 03:17:35,860
and it doesn't work. Usually I can go like this, bang, and hit the overhead light right here,

800
03:17:35,860 --> 03:17:42,329
but it's off. So there's one light over in the corner that doesn't work. All right, we're good.

801
03:17:42,889 --> 03:17:50,889
Let's go. I can read this. Phase one, depart from campus with the target.

802
03:17:50,889 --> 03:17:55,940
Escort the target as usual until the start of phase two. There should be three others inside

803
03:17:55,940 --> 03:18:00,469
the vehicle, including Baker. Able's unit will follow behind you in a separate vehicle.

804
03:18:00,469 --> 03:18:06,329
Continue to drive at your normal route. Stop the vehicle under the pretense of engine trouble.

805
03:18:06,329 --> 03:18:11,530
Transfer the target to Able's vehicle. Able's unit will change course. Subdue and restrain the

806
03:18:11,530 --> 03:18:16,600
target. Place the target in a large container. Baker's unit will create a diversion. Henry's

807
03:18:16,600 --> 03:18:22,819
unit will infiltrate the investigation's database and disable the network. Meet at point K9 and

808
03:18:22,819 --> 03:18:30,020
transfer the cargo. What are they talking about? What does that mean? What are they talking about?

809
03:18:30,020 --> 03:19:04,090
There's a treasure here. A large gold bar. Okay. Nice. Get out of here. This game is so good.

810
03:19:04,809 --> 03:19:17,700
This game is so fun. Look alive. Is there really something in there?

811
03:19:25,190 --> 03:19:29,750
That must be so weird. Imagine you're just hanging out waiting for me at some point.

812
03:19:29,750 --> 03:19:34,200
You don't know when I'm going to show up. And then this is how I appear.

813
03:19:34,760 --> 03:19:42,709
I just would scare the shit out of me. This would be terrifying. That would be so scary.

814
03:19:51,780 --> 03:20:12,969
Welcome. What can I do you for? That's good work if I do say so myself. Reload speed probably. Yeah.

815
03:20:13,610 --> 03:20:22,809
Try that on for size. See how that feels mate. A fellow like yourself should notice the difference

816
03:20:22,809 --> 03:20:33,850
right away. Okay. Will that be all then? Pleasant travel. Are we enjoying the game? Yes. Very much

817
03:20:33,850 --> 03:20:41,510
so. We're almost at the end as well. We only got probably like what? An hour or two? I think this

818
03:20:41,510 --> 03:21:03,370
is the end of the chapter coming up here. Okay. Oh wait. I remember this part. This part was weird.

819
03:21:05,610 --> 03:21:10,569
The ruins. Oh yeah. I forgot about the ruins. It was a little more sandy in the old one.

820
03:21:10,569 --> 03:21:37,770
You always had poor judgment. But if you think I'm going to let you out of here alive,

821
03:21:37,770 --> 03:21:45,959
you're even more naive than I thought. You can't save her. You can't save anyone. Give it up,

822
03:21:45,959 --> 03:21:50,760
Krauser. Had enough. Being a lackey for these maniacs won't bring your men back.

823
03:21:52,120 --> 03:21:59,319
And what the hell for? Revenge on the government? You think they would want that? Revenge.

824
03:22:00,200 --> 03:22:07,079
You think I'm doing all this for revenge? Isn't that what this is all about? See,

825
03:22:07,959 --> 03:22:15,659
in that jungle I had a revelation. The most important thing in this world is pure

826
03:22:16,379 --> 03:22:24,139
unadulterated power. Giving me that. You know you were always an asshole.

827
03:22:24,940 --> 03:22:35,659
But at least you had some kind of code. Some honor. Look at you now. Enough reminiscing.

828
03:22:37,610 --> 03:22:39,770
Move out and draw fire, soldier.

829
03:22:49,459 --> 03:22:55,989
Squibs didn't go off, Krauser. I just turned him into Super Mario.

830
03:23:21,379 --> 03:23:50,649
Drop it. What's that mean? Remember the basics of CQC? Yeah.

831
03:24:42,139 --> 03:25:01,129
Stop talking out loud, Leon. He's laid this place out with traps. I better be careful. I

832
03:25:01,209 --> 03:25:25,420
probably shouldn't walk into the red laser right here in front of me. Can I turn this off if I get

833
03:25:25,420 --> 03:25:49,479
close enough? What is that? What's going on? What's that sound? Oh, I got it. Did I get it?

834
03:25:50,200 --> 03:26:25,770
I got it. Oh, nice. Sentry down. That's a pretty good one.

835
03:26:39,610 --> 03:27:27,340
Sorry. Slowly filling this back up. Slowly filling it back up.

836
03:27:27,420 --> 03:27:38,950
I'd be dead if I kept listening to people like you.

837
03:27:49,100 --> 03:27:53,909
That also means the Reaper is coming for you. Don't talk over me during my big moment.

838
03:27:53,909 --> 03:27:56,790
The Reaper is coming for you too then. Doesn't that mean it's coming for us all?

839
03:27:56,790 --> 03:28:00,459
It's coming for you too? That would have been way cooler.

840
03:28:21,659 --> 03:28:25,180
Chefs, four of you are going to make it through the next round.

841
03:28:25,899 --> 03:28:31,690
Only two of you will do this next challenge. Before you is a sacred ingredient.

842
03:28:32,569 --> 03:28:43,819
All right. I don't want to get killed. Didn't even hurt.

843
03:28:58,229 --> 03:29:00,649
What was that?

844
03:29:25,610 --> 03:29:36,780
Oh, I got them all. He's going to run into this.

845
03:29:37,500 --> 03:29:51,500
We're done here, Krauser. Again. Time for the Las Lagas.

846
03:30:09,479 --> 03:30:16,180
That's the difference between you and me, Loki.

847
03:30:16,180 --> 03:30:17,620
It's like Nightmare from Soul Calibur.

848
03:30:18,420 --> 03:30:53,579
Yeah. Can I get time out for a minute? I'm crafting.

849
03:31:21,000 --> 03:31:23,719
Reload it. Hold on, Krauser. Let me reload every single gun.

850
03:31:23,879 --> 03:32:11,940
I just pissed him off so bad. Hey, guys. We're back.

851
03:32:13,479 --> 03:32:36,409
Get all this ammo now. I'm getting kind of stacked here.

852
03:32:36,409 --> 03:32:47,530
There are slugs. I got all 48 are loaded. I got 50. Look, I have 51.

853
03:33:02,489 --> 03:33:08,520
Here we go.

854
03:33:10,520 --> 03:33:11,879
Time for the teacher to be taught.

855
03:33:30,360 --> 03:33:47,450
Okay, I'm fine. Oh, shit. He's kind of fast.

856
03:33:48,090 --> 03:34:27,290
Look at my head. What the fuck am I doing?

857
03:34:38,760 --> 03:34:44,069
Tab didn't open the inventory. It was stuck. I pressed Tab.

858
03:35:10,059 --> 03:35:23,989
Stop hitting me. It's annoying. What the fuck am I doing?

859
03:35:31,079 --> 03:35:59,430
Get out of here. 50 slugs, Stephen. He loves the cheese shotgun.

860
03:35:59,989 --> 03:36:04,790
Well, I put almost $400,000 into this. I'm going to use it on the bosses.

861
03:36:05,350 --> 03:36:10,840
And then if I run out of ammo, I have 20 shots with the fully upgraded butterfly

862
03:36:10,840 --> 03:36:12,680
at the end of the game and I can kill the boss in like three hits.

863
03:37:19,319 --> 03:37:27,159
Almost lost it there. I think there's some other items to get.

864
03:37:27,159 --> 03:37:50,860
The new knife is sick. I bet it is. And we still have plenty of shotgun shots.

865
03:37:50,860 --> 03:37:55,610
Wait, there's no time to escape, somebody said.

866
03:37:55,610 --> 03:38:11,219
Yeah, doesn't that happen? Did they take that out?

867
03:38:11,219 --> 03:38:20,469
Hmm, interesting. There's a couple of very decent changes in the remake.

868
03:38:20,469 --> 03:38:32,920
Is it on professional? Oh, that's not the last boss.

869
03:38:32,920 --> 03:38:36,139
But I feel like doesn't it? I'm just remembering it wrong.

870
03:38:36,139 --> 03:38:48,229
They removed the underground huge monster. 14 beat Jack Krauser.

871
03:38:48,229 --> 03:38:51,659
Killed two parasites inside a regenerator with a single bullet.

872
03:38:52,219 --> 03:38:57,370
Destroyed five targets at the shooting range with one shot.

873
03:38:57,370 --> 03:39:07,909
Cool. All right, we're going to take a quick break.

874
03:39:07,909 --> 03:39:09,829
I have not gone to the bathroom. I'm going to go pee.

875
03:39:09,829 --> 03:39:14,659
I'm going to get some more water and we will be back in a minute or two.

876
03:39:14,659 --> 03:46:56,149
See you in a sec. Hey, how's it going?

877
03:46:56,149 --> 03:47:02,700
Scared you? Didn't mean to.

878
03:47:03,260 --> 03:47:07,420
All right, let's get to the end game. There's only one.

879
03:47:08,059 --> 03:47:21,209
I think the last chapter is very short. Let's go for it.

880
03:47:21,209 --> 03:47:24,489
We got one more after this, but I think it's a pretty short one.

881
03:47:24,489 --> 03:47:27,700
So this is probably going to be another maybe a couple hours.

882
03:47:28,420 --> 03:47:33,579
I am not going to rush through this because this is a great game.

883
03:47:33,579 --> 03:47:38,299
I love this game and I don't want to just run through.

884
03:47:38,299 --> 03:47:40,139
But we are at the final arc.

885
03:47:58,260 --> 03:48:01,290
You're going to finish this tonight? Yes.

886
03:48:01,290 --> 03:48:08,600
That's got to be their sanctuary.

887
03:48:08,600 --> 03:48:10,120
I will finish the game tonight.

888
03:48:10,120 --> 03:48:12,229
Ashley.

889
03:48:12,229 --> 03:48:27,930
Okay. I feel like I got to move in a little more.

890
03:48:28,489 --> 03:48:30,260
I feel like I'm too far away from everything.

891
03:48:30,899 --> 03:48:37,500
That's better. Okay, good.

892
03:48:37,500 --> 03:48:46,299
Let's go. Wait, I just don't.

893
03:48:48,229 --> 03:48:49,190
When's the boss fight?

894
03:48:49,190 --> 03:48:51,989
Take a look. Something's bound to catch your eye.

895
03:48:52,790 --> 03:48:53,670
I just did one, man.

896
03:48:54,950 --> 03:48:59,879
Well caught a selection of good things on sale, stranger.

897
03:49:00,700 --> 03:49:04,139
A well-tuned weapon can make up for a lack of skin.

898
03:49:04,139 --> 03:49:11,000
You could probably play through most of the game with the knife.

899
03:49:11,000 --> 03:49:12,440
So this is the better knife.

900
03:49:13,000 --> 03:49:14,360
Should I sell the other one?

901
03:49:14,360 --> 03:49:21,260
Should I sell the combat knife?

902
03:49:21,260 --> 03:49:23,819
Ruby's all rubbish. It makes no difference.

903
03:49:23,819 --> 03:49:27,739
The price? Well, that's our choice to make.

904
03:49:27,739 --> 03:49:31,190
Why not? Just upgrade the other one.

905
03:49:35,670 --> 03:49:36,549
You could keep both.

906
03:49:37,190 --> 03:49:40,200
Also when this one's done, I can go to this one.

907
03:49:41,299 --> 03:49:42,260
Oh, so I'm going to have to...

908
03:49:43,379 --> 03:49:47,110
Well, then I guess I will tune it up or not.

909
03:49:48,819 --> 03:49:49,780
I'm going to stick with the plan.

910
03:49:54,500 --> 03:49:55,299
I'm going to stick with the plan.

911
03:49:56,229 --> 03:49:56,870
That's cool, though.

912
03:49:58,780 --> 03:50:00,299
40% off. Damn.

913
03:50:01,420 --> 03:50:02,700
I'm not going to use it anyways.

914
03:50:04,729 --> 03:50:07,659
I've already got my setup.

915
03:50:11,559 --> 03:50:12,600
Is it equipped?

916
03:50:12,600 --> 03:50:15,559
It's not equipped, but I'll equip it after.

917
03:50:24,969 --> 03:50:25,850
Buy resources?

918
03:50:27,850 --> 03:50:29,450
Did he fill the shop up with resources?

919
03:50:32,620 --> 03:50:33,500
Oh, he did. Okay.

920
03:50:36,299 --> 03:50:53,299
Don't get yourself killed now.

921
03:50:53,299 --> 03:51:05,610
Okay. Save it again.

922
03:51:05,610 --> 03:51:07,290
I would be so bad with the save shit.

923
03:51:07,290 --> 03:51:09,770
I just... I'm such a compulsive saver.

924
03:51:25,020 --> 03:51:34,729
Whoa. Oh, he almost hit your friend.

925
03:51:54,889 --> 03:52:06,409
Imagine him. Back up.

926
03:52:15,979 --> 03:52:24,700
You got it. Nice shooting.

927
03:52:35,750 --> 03:52:38,700
Shoot him. Shoot these guys.

928
03:52:47,139 --> 03:52:49,639
I got to keep moving. Treasure.

929
03:52:49,639 --> 03:53:10,459
Where's the treasure? Back here.

930
03:53:10,459 --> 03:53:12,059
I mean, I'm farming right now.

931
03:53:12,059 --> 03:53:13,500
This actually is kind of cool.

932
03:53:13,500 --> 03:53:14,219
I can just farm.

933
03:53:14,860 --> 03:53:29,209
All right. I'm done. I'm done.

934
03:53:41,780 --> 03:53:58,500
Thank you. Nice work.

935
03:53:58,500 --> 03:54:35,700
All right. Get them. Nice. Good work.

936
03:54:50,340 --> 03:54:52,340
Stop. You're shooting at me right now.

937
03:54:52,340 --> 03:55:35,559
Treasures. I got you.

938
03:55:35,559 --> 03:55:59,510
Where are you pissing? Where do I go?

939
03:56:18,680 --> 03:56:40,760
What are you talking about?

940
03:56:40,760 --> 03:56:42,840
Oh, my God. You're shooting me.

941
03:56:56,309 --> 03:57:04,500
Wait. Oh, it's... Dude, stop.

942
03:57:05,059 --> 03:57:29,159
Put it down.

943
03:57:52,309 --> 03:57:54,229
Like, what is even happening right now?

944
03:57:54,229 --> 03:57:56,790
Like, dude, I fucking shot the guy like eight times.

945
03:57:57,110 --> 03:58:16,180
He's just so close.

946
03:58:17,139 --> 03:58:19,780
Whatever. And horse shit.

947
03:58:26,459 --> 03:58:28,219
All right. Okay. All right.

948
03:58:30,729 --> 03:58:39,530
You're going to shoot that shit, isn't it?

949
03:58:39,530 --> 03:58:41,930
I can't right now. Man.

950
03:58:44,219 --> 03:58:53,530
You know what? Get the fuck away from me, all of you.

951
03:59:16,729 --> 03:59:19,670
Okay. Where... Are there people on those?

952
03:59:25,420 --> 03:59:25,920
Stop it.

953
04:00:14,659 --> 04:00:16,420
How do I get up there?

954
04:00:16,420 --> 04:00:21,100
I have to go down?

955
04:00:21,100 --> 04:00:22,709
Well, there's a bunch of shit in here.

956
04:00:23,350 --> 04:00:28,010
That's the shortcut.

957
04:00:28,649 --> 04:00:31,979
I don't know, dude. You're the expert.

958
04:00:31,979 --> 04:00:33,420
I haven't played this game in 10 years.

959
04:00:35,209 --> 04:00:37,340
I... Do I go down?

960
04:00:49,719 --> 04:00:54,440
Okay. All right. Now, where can I go?

961
04:00:54,440 --> 04:01:07,700
Up? Can I do it with a grenade?

962
04:01:08,700 --> 04:01:09,340
I don't think so.

963
04:01:10,329 --> 04:01:11,610
I think I gotta go all the way.

964
04:01:11,610 --> 04:01:14,229
I think it's a scripted thing.

965
04:01:14,229 --> 04:01:15,590
Throw grenades at it? No, I'm good.

966
04:01:15,590 --> 04:01:16,389
I'm just gonna go this way.

967
04:01:47,420 --> 04:01:56,149
Okay. You piece of shit.

968
04:02:02,950 --> 04:02:03,450
I'm all right.

969
04:02:55,100 --> 04:02:57,940
All right. We did it. Nice job.

970
04:02:57,940 --> 04:03:14,709
Now what? Jump down? Now what?

971
04:03:14,709 --> 04:03:17,350
You're gonna blow something up for me?

972
04:03:17,350 --> 04:03:26,940
You're gonna blow this up?

973
04:03:26,940 --> 04:03:31,620
There we go.

974
04:03:31,620 --> 04:03:35,700
Did you even tweet?

975
04:03:35,700 --> 04:03:47,579
Oh, probably not.

976
04:03:47,579 --> 04:03:48,379
Out of ammo?

977
04:04:21,500 --> 04:04:22,860
You've gotta be fucking kidding me.

978
04:04:22,860 --> 04:04:23,500
The guy hit me.

979
04:04:23,500 --> 04:04:25,500
He got triple tapped me in a melee.

980
04:04:25,500 --> 04:04:29,370
They don't even swing that much.

981
04:04:29,370 --> 04:04:31,930
They literally don't even swing more than three times.

982
04:04:31,930 --> 04:04:32,489
More than two.

983
04:04:32,489 --> 04:04:33,690
I'm... Good thing I saved it.

984
04:04:48,170 --> 04:04:50,250
It pisses me off when they do the little juke.

985
04:04:50,969 --> 04:04:55,430
I'm so angry about that.

986
04:04:56,309 --> 04:04:57,239
They do the...

987
04:04:59,700 --> 04:05:00,500
Just reload. Just kill me.

988
04:05:00,500 --> 04:05:01,780
Reload. Just reload. Reload.

989
04:05:01,780 --> 04:05:02,260
Just hit me.

990
04:05:02,819 --> 04:05:04,180
Just reload it. Reload it. Reload it.

991
04:05:04,180 --> 04:05:04,739
This is stupid.

992
04:05:08,920 --> 04:05:10,280
Holy shit, dude.

993
04:05:15,860 --> 04:05:16,979
Stop overreacting?

994
04:05:18,250 --> 04:05:19,129
I'm not.

995
04:05:19,129 --> 04:05:24,680
This is just fucking mayhem every five seconds.

996
04:05:25,319 --> 04:05:36,069
Oh my god.

997
04:05:36,870 --> 04:05:42,020
This is just fucking mayhem.

998
04:05:42,899 --> 04:05:45,239
They don't even know what they're attacking.

999
04:05:45,239 --> 04:05:47,159
They're just shooting at random people.

1000
04:05:49,059 --> 04:05:49,860
Look at this.

1001
04:05:49,860 --> 04:05:50,819
I can't even run.

1002
04:06:13,670 --> 04:06:18,979
Okay. Yeah.

1003
04:06:19,940 --> 04:06:21,299
Yeah. Good. Nice job.

1004
04:06:22,180 --> 04:06:22,659
Fuck you.

1005
04:06:23,459 --> 04:06:38,840
What are you all doing?

1006
04:06:38,840 --> 04:06:39,879
You weren't even near me.

1007
04:06:40,440 --> 04:06:41,639
Literally nobody was here.

1008
04:06:42,360 --> 04:07:35,059
I have a sniper rifle.

1009
04:07:35,059 --> 04:07:35,700
Are you dumb?

1010
04:07:36,260 --> 04:07:49,979
I just spent 15 hours in game without a sniper rifle.

1011
04:07:49,979 --> 04:07:52,860
So now I have one magically and my brain is just like, no, you don't.

1012
04:07:53,500 --> 04:07:54,059
All right. Let's go.

1013
04:07:54,700 --> 04:07:55,739
Anything else I need to do here?

1014
04:07:58,520 --> 04:07:59,559
I don't think so.

1015
04:08:00,280 --> 04:08:01,239
I have to put these...

1016
04:08:01,239 --> 04:08:02,520
Oh, yeah. Okay. Here we go.

1017
04:08:03,319 --> 04:08:19,620
Don't even think about it.

1018
04:08:20,180 --> 04:08:21,540
Don't even think about it.

1019
04:08:22,100 --> 04:08:25,989
Don't even think about it.

1020
04:08:25,989 --> 04:08:47,350
It's the best way to get over there.

1021
04:08:47,909 --> 04:08:54,870
Oh, God is one of those things.

1022
04:08:54,870 --> 04:08:56,100
What's wrong with me?

1023
04:08:56,739 --> 04:08:58,729
What is wrong with my character?

1024
04:08:58,729 --> 04:08:59,129
Why is he...

1025
04:08:59,129 --> 04:09:00,569
Why am I limping like this?

1026
04:09:01,209 --> 04:09:03,290
Why am I limping?

1027
04:09:15,340 --> 04:09:40,520
Whoa. All right.

1028
04:09:40,520 --> 04:09:41,719
How do I get over there?

1029
04:09:41,719 --> 04:09:49,319
Through this building.

1030
04:09:49,319 --> 04:09:50,200
Okay. Through here.

1031
04:09:51,860 --> 04:09:52,340
This way.

1032
04:09:52,979 --> 04:10:08,950
And then...

1033
04:10:08,950 --> 04:10:09,909
Wait. How do I get in there?

1034
04:10:10,709 --> 04:10:15,100
Can I press the...

1035
04:10:15,100 --> 04:10:16,139
Is there an elevator I can press?

1036
04:10:19,379 --> 04:10:20,180
I can't go in there.

1037
04:10:20,180 --> 04:10:44,100
Hold on. There.

1038
04:10:44,100 --> 04:10:45,059
All right. Let's go.

1039
04:10:45,059 --> 04:10:53,639
Imagine being in this orchestra.

1040
04:10:53,639 --> 04:10:56,040
This is a killing zombie soundtrack.

1041
04:10:56,040 --> 04:11:00,819
Really? That'd be kind of cool.

1042
04:11:00,819 --> 04:11:08,440
Anybody? No. Let's go.

1043
04:11:08,440 --> 04:11:09,719
There's probably treasures and shit here,

1044
04:11:09,719 --> 04:11:11,559
but anytime this music plays like this,

1045
04:11:11,559 --> 04:11:12,440
I just have to run.

1046
04:11:13,079 --> 04:11:14,920
This is just panic music.

1047
04:11:15,639 --> 04:11:17,620
Remember when I used to turn off the music

1048
04:11:17,620 --> 04:11:18,819
for Dark Souls bosses and win?

1049
04:11:20,569 --> 04:11:21,209
Same scenario.

1050
04:12:00,469 --> 04:12:18,819
He's all right.

1051
04:12:18,819 --> 04:12:19,299
He's okay.

1052
04:12:20,180 --> 04:12:20,819
He's all right.

1053
04:12:21,540 --> 04:12:34,329
This is new.

1054
04:12:34,969 --> 04:12:37,000
I think this actually is new.

1055
04:12:37,559 --> 04:12:43,690
Hey, this is new.

1056
04:12:54,700 --> 04:12:55,260
In the old one,

1057
04:12:55,260 --> 04:12:58,059
he doesn't use his arm and go through the windshield.

1058
04:12:58,620 --> 04:13:10,229
Oh, it's a rocket launcher.

1059
04:13:10,229 --> 04:13:11,850
Right. Interesting.

1060
04:13:11,850 --> 04:13:13,719
Okay. It was a rocket.

1061
04:13:13,719 --> 04:13:14,600
Right, right, right, right.

1062
04:13:21,079 --> 04:13:31,819
Ooh. Let's check up here first.

1063
04:13:31,819 --> 04:13:35,959
Honestly, that makes a bit more sense,

1064
04:13:35,959 --> 04:13:37,000
but whatever.

1065
04:13:37,000 --> 04:13:44,520
I got a lot of money.

1066
04:13:44,520 --> 04:13:45,719
Is there anything else I want to do

1067
04:13:46,360 --> 04:13:50,059
before I get to the very end here?

1068
04:13:56,360 --> 04:13:58,440
Make sure you shoot this medallion here.

1069
04:13:58,440 --> 04:14:02,309
Oh shit. I can't even see it.

1070
04:14:02,309 --> 04:14:21,510
Okay. Blue medallions.

1071
04:14:21,510 --> 04:14:22,309
Any more here?

1072
04:14:22,309 --> 04:14:26,520
Looks like there's another...

1073
04:14:26,520 --> 04:14:29,049
I think I have to get them all right now.

1074
04:14:29,690 --> 04:14:56,200
Get in the water?

1075
04:14:56,200 --> 04:15:05,139
It's below me.

1076
04:15:05,139 --> 04:15:07,899
It's below me.

1077
04:15:07,899 --> 04:15:10,040
Okay. What about this one?

1078
04:15:10,040 --> 04:15:14,620
There's one up here.

1079
04:15:14,620 --> 04:15:19,209
What's the best way to go up there?

1080
04:15:19,209 --> 04:15:20,700
I don't know.

1081
04:15:20,700 --> 04:15:28,340
Below me.

1082
04:15:31,770 --> 04:15:32,409
Below me.

1083
04:15:34,069 --> 04:15:34,549
Whatever.

1084
04:15:35,110 --> 04:15:53,399
I don't know where it is.

1085
04:15:53,399 --> 04:15:57,180
I don't really care about the spinals anymore anyways.

1086
04:15:57,180 --> 04:16:10,440
Down in here somewhere?

1087
04:16:10,440 --> 04:16:15,590
What is this?

1088
04:16:15,590 --> 04:16:22,979
Ooh. Staff of royalty.

1089
04:16:23,540 --> 04:16:27,180
Very cool.

1090
04:16:27,180 --> 04:16:27,979
Nice.

1091
04:16:27,979 --> 04:16:32,549
That's probably worth a lot.

1092
04:16:32,549 --> 04:16:37,180
Okay. This is in here somewhere.

1093
04:16:37,180 --> 04:16:43,319
No, it's not.

1094
04:16:43,319 --> 04:16:45,420
I don't even care. I'm leaving.

1095
04:16:45,420 --> 04:16:58,440
You just have to give up and then you'll find it.

1096
04:16:58,440 --> 04:16:59,399
This one is...

1097
04:16:59,399 --> 04:16:59,959
I wonder if I can...

1098
04:16:59,959 --> 04:17:00,440
No, wait, wait.

1099
04:17:00,440 --> 04:17:01,000
I think I can...

1100
04:17:01,079 --> 04:17:03,879
Can I lean out the edge here and get this one if I go out here?

1101
04:17:03,879 --> 04:17:06,940
I think if I go down here and look that way?

1102
04:17:06,940 --> 04:17:58,329
Finished.

1103
04:17:58,329 --> 04:17:59,450
Is your cosplay is Leon?

1104
04:17:59,450 --> 04:18:00,729
We talked about it the other day.

1105
04:18:00,729 --> 04:18:05,750
I'll do it on your birthday.

1106
04:18:05,750 --> 04:18:28,899
Who's birthday?

1107
04:18:30,010 --> 04:18:31,129
Whoever's birthday is...

1108
04:18:34,139 --> 04:18:36,629
Never mind.

1109
04:18:36,629 --> 04:18:37,510
I'll take it back.

1110
04:18:37,510 --> 04:18:43,270
The repairs were completed without issue

1111
04:18:43,270 --> 04:18:46,389
since the facility was previously used for confinement.

1112
04:18:46,389 --> 04:18:51,270
The work required to reinforce the airtight ceiling was minimal.

1113
04:18:51,270 --> 04:18:54,389
As long as we don't run into any issues with the cooling system test,

1114
04:18:54,389 --> 04:18:57,989
we plan to bring in all the remaining specimens from Facility 1.

1115
04:18:57,989 --> 04:19:08,139
We changed my title.

1116
04:19:08,139 --> 04:19:10,700
All specimens were successfully transferred.

1117
04:19:10,700 --> 04:19:13,260
However, we experienced a slight hiccup during transport

1118
04:19:13,260 --> 04:19:15,159
as one of them became violent.

1119
04:19:15,159 --> 04:19:18,950
Luckily, the number of casualties was less than anticipated.

1120
04:19:18,950 --> 04:19:21,770
Please be extra careful when dealing with them.

1121
04:19:21,770 --> 04:19:23,770
We have received reports that they are beginning to acquire

1122
04:19:23,770 --> 04:19:25,850
a tolerance for the low temperatures.

1123
04:19:25,850 --> 04:19:37,739
I think I can make some gear now.

1124
04:19:49,670 --> 04:19:50,709
Loading back up.

1125
04:19:50,709 --> 04:19:53,940
This doesn't open.

1126
04:19:53,940 --> 04:19:54,180
I...

1127
04:19:54,180 --> 04:19:57,940
Oh, I hear a thingy.

1128
04:20:04,870 --> 04:20:05,989
Splendid bangle.

1129
04:20:13,819 --> 04:20:21,829
Okay.

1130
04:20:21,829 --> 04:20:23,690
These are gonna open, aren't they?

1131
04:20:27,819 --> 04:20:28,459
Oh, quick!

1132
04:20:29,100 --> 04:20:38,979
So I'm gonna jump out of one of these.

1133
04:20:38,979 --> 04:20:39,459
I know what...

1134
04:20:42,299 --> 04:20:42,860
What was that?

1135
04:20:54,540 --> 04:20:55,659
What the fuck?

1136
04:21:14,899 --> 04:21:15,219
Oh!

1137
04:21:20,379 --> 04:21:21,420
No, you're on the ground.

1138
04:21:21,420 --> 04:21:22,299
That's so annoying.

1139
04:22:21,829 --> 04:22:23,110
Homer Simpson?

1140
04:22:23,110 --> 04:22:27,020
Maybe a little.

1141
04:22:27,020 --> 04:22:42,229
Nice.

1142
04:22:53,819 --> 04:22:54,059
Eight.

1143
04:22:56,059 --> 04:22:57,579
I think it's just all money at this point.

1144
04:22:58,299 --> 04:23:00,149
What's that face?

1145
04:23:03,260 --> 04:23:04,299
What's that face?

1146
04:23:04,299 --> 04:23:05,899
I think I'm just going full on money.

1147
04:23:06,540 --> 04:23:09,139
Yeah, we're just doing money.

1148
04:23:09,139 --> 04:23:09,540
Let's go.

1149
04:23:19,340 --> 04:23:20,219
25k.

1150
04:23:20,219 --> 04:23:20,700
Hell yeah.

1151
04:23:21,420 --> 04:23:23,370
25k again.

1152
04:23:26,889 --> 04:23:28,170
Ooh, if I can do that.

1153
04:23:33,579 --> 04:23:41,700
Let's go.

1154
04:23:42,340 --> 04:23:44,219
I have so many...

1155
04:23:44,219 --> 04:23:45,819
There might be time just to start selling everything.

1156
04:23:49,500 --> 04:23:50,780
It's probably time to start selling.

1157
04:24:05,829 --> 04:24:06,950
Sniper rifle all the way?

1158
04:24:07,750 --> 04:24:08,469
I can get clothes.

1159
04:24:34,059 --> 04:24:34,540
Very cool.

1160
04:24:37,500 --> 04:24:39,739
Oh, there's another one of those down there.

1161
04:24:39,819 --> 04:24:40,459
Nice.

1162
04:24:40,459 --> 04:24:42,219
All right, what can I do here?

1163
04:24:42,219 --> 04:24:47,579
There's another one of these?

1164
04:24:48,819 --> 04:24:49,379
Holy shit.

1165
04:24:49,379 --> 04:24:58,549
Okay, gotta check it out.

1166
04:24:59,110 --> 04:25:26,979
Oh no, this is just if you want to do it again.

1167
04:25:26,979 --> 04:25:27,860
Yeah, I'm good.

1168
04:25:27,860 --> 04:25:30,170
It's a really cool part of the game, but I'm good.

1169
04:25:30,170 --> 04:25:34,219
I don't need all S-Ranks.

1170
04:25:34,219 --> 04:25:45,690
Very cool.

1171
04:25:45,690 --> 04:25:46,409
Let's go.

1172
04:25:46,409 --> 04:25:56,120
Sell the old knife.

1173
04:25:56,120 --> 04:25:57,879
I'll probably just hang on to it, honestly.

1174
04:25:57,879 --> 04:26:01,180
I might need it.

1175
04:26:01,180 --> 04:26:11,110
Okay, this is where we're going.

1176
04:26:11,110 --> 04:26:11,979
Let's go.

1177
04:26:12,540 --> 04:26:21,219
Really?

1178
04:26:29,420 --> 04:26:51,659
You finishing the game tonight?

1179
04:26:51,659 --> 04:26:56,389
You betcha.

1180
04:26:56,389 --> 04:26:57,510
Yes, I am.

1181
04:26:57,510 --> 04:27:15,559
What happened up there?

1182
04:27:20,569 --> 04:27:22,489
Oh, come on, dude.

1183
04:27:22,489 --> 04:27:47,420
I hear a bug.

1184
04:27:47,420 --> 04:27:58,469
There's so many critters in this game.

1185
04:27:58,469 --> 04:27:59,430
There are a lot of critters.

1186
04:27:59,430 --> 04:28:00,069
You're right.

1187
04:28:00,069 --> 04:28:05,719
Why is it playing this music?

1188
04:28:09,270 --> 04:28:10,229
This is what I'm talking about.

1189
04:28:10,229 --> 04:28:11,110
Why is it playing this?

1190
04:28:15,620 --> 04:28:18,260
This is the look out, watch out music.

1191
04:28:27,610 --> 04:28:31,049
Nice.

1192
04:28:31,049 --> 04:28:32,809
We are under fucking attack.

1193
04:28:32,809 --> 04:28:46,069
Yeah, that is what that is going on in there.

1194
04:28:46,069 --> 04:28:48,629
There's a halloween house over here.

1195
04:28:48,629 --> 04:28:49,430
That's a haunted house.

1196
04:28:58,680 --> 04:29:24,979
Can you turn lo-fi beats on?

1197
04:29:27,540 --> 04:29:28,659
You can just open it.

1198
04:29:28,659 --> 04:30:07,819
That is a shitload of people here now.

1199
04:30:07,819 --> 04:30:08,860
Throw it, throw it out here.

1200
04:30:08,860 --> 04:30:17,530
Is that guy still in there or is he dead?

1201
04:30:18,840 --> 04:30:20,200
Oh, he died.

1202
04:30:20,200 --> 04:30:24,700
That's a lot of ammo.

1203
04:30:29,719 --> 04:30:31,719
Any plans for a Yonkey Splonkey 2?

1204
04:30:32,280 --> 04:30:34,040
You had an OG Twitch dance.

1205
04:30:34,040 --> 04:30:35,479
Now, everyone's doing their own thing.

1206
04:30:43,750 --> 04:30:44,469
I don't know if my...

1207
04:30:45,500 --> 04:30:47,020
I think you guys came up with that.

1208
04:30:47,020 --> 04:30:49,500
I kind of just did a dance and then you guys named it.

1209
04:30:49,500 --> 04:30:58,069
What's that sound?

1210
04:30:58,069 --> 04:31:08,010
Do a Yonkey Splonkey remake.

1211
04:31:08,010 --> 04:31:23,020
Where is it?

1212
04:31:23,020 --> 04:31:23,899
That was pretty good.

1213
04:31:24,620 --> 04:31:25,739
That was actually really good.

1214
04:31:29,260 --> 04:31:30,059
Oh, thank God.

1215
04:31:37,079 --> 04:31:37,879
Oh my God.

1216
04:31:37,959 --> 04:31:38,360
Oh my God.

1217
04:31:38,360 --> 04:31:38,760
Oh my God.

1218
04:31:38,760 --> 04:31:39,079
Oh my God.

1219
04:31:39,079 --> 04:31:46,389
Oh my God.

1220
04:31:46,389 --> 04:32:05,399
Oh, oh my goodness.

1221
04:32:06,899 --> 04:32:07,459
Where'd it go?

1222
04:32:16,379 --> 04:32:17,500
It's opening the door.

1223
04:32:25,299 --> 04:32:27,940
Dude, it's fucking opening doors.

1224
04:32:27,940 --> 04:32:43,909
I forgot the last arc of this game goes very, very hard.

1225
04:32:48,069 --> 04:32:49,930
Gets crazy.

1226
04:32:49,930 --> 04:33:02,200
Okay, nice.

1227
04:33:02,200 --> 04:33:11,060
I hate all things that are critters.

1228
04:33:11,060 --> 04:33:12,729
Why do you hate critters?

1229
04:33:12,729 --> 04:33:15,799
You don't like critters?

1230
04:33:15,799 --> 04:33:16,439
Why not?

1231
04:33:16,439 --> 04:33:17,000
What's wrong?

1232
04:33:17,000 --> 04:33:35,000
Okay, well, I need to turn that off.

1233
04:33:35,000 --> 04:33:35,880
It's 11-11.

1234
04:33:35,880 --> 04:33:36,680
Make a wish.

1235
04:33:36,680 --> 04:34:03,849
What'd you wish for?

1236
04:34:03,849 --> 04:34:05,290
You can't tell people what you wish for.

1237
04:34:05,290 --> 04:34:13,500
Otherwise, it won't come true.

1238
04:34:13,500 --> 04:34:14,700
I know some of you.

1239
04:34:14,700 --> 04:34:18,180
Some of you have only wished for this.

1240
04:34:18,180 --> 04:34:25,259
The Yonkey Splonkey remake.

1241
04:34:25,259 --> 04:34:26,299
Wish granted.

1242
04:34:26,299 --> 04:34:53,159
Anything over here?

1243
04:34:53,159 --> 04:35:03,750
Hot scene, probably.

1244
04:35:11,909 --> 04:35:27,189
I hear red barrel.

1245
04:35:27,189 --> 04:35:29,700
All right.

1246
04:35:29,700 --> 04:35:30,979
I, Adam.

1247
04:35:48,580 --> 04:36:02,459
It didn't go far enough.

1248
04:36:02,459 --> 04:36:25,340
But I wish to share this gift with as many as possible.

1249
04:36:26,680 --> 04:36:28,279
A humble wish, don't you think?

1250
04:36:30,009 --> 04:36:35,159
You see, we are all connected through the Holy Body.

1251
04:36:35,159 --> 04:36:39,159
And now your flesh and bones, your very thoughts.

1252
04:36:40,040 --> 04:36:40,919
Is that a skull?

1253
04:36:44,020 --> 04:36:46,500
It kind of looks like Bowser from the old Mario movie.

1254
04:36:47,220 --> 04:36:54,790
Accept the sacred gift.

1255
04:36:58,419 --> 04:36:59,380
She did.

1256
04:37:00,419 --> 04:37:00,900
Souther!

1257
04:37:05,400 --> 04:37:07,319
Yes, the time has come.

1258
04:37:08,200 --> 04:37:11,080
We'll be slain to join our covenant.

1259
04:37:11,799 --> 04:37:15,959
Oh, blessings on to him and the sweet mercy they bring.

1260
04:37:16,040 --> 04:37:16,680
And salt!

1261
04:37:17,959 --> 04:37:20,279
And let it be salt!

1262
04:37:24,279 --> 04:37:24,840
Ah, shit!

1263
04:37:25,880 --> 04:37:34,540
Let's get out of here.

1264
04:37:45,580 --> 04:37:58,380
All right.

1265
04:37:58,380 --> 04:37:58,939
Time to go.

1266
04:38:05,319 --> 04:38:06,759
Any items over here?

1267
04:38:19,939 --> 04:38:22,439
Where do we go?

1268
04:38:22,439 --> 04:38:23,319
Laboratory B.

1269
04:38:24,040 --> 04:38:47,380
Okay, let's go.

1270
04:38:47,380 --> 04:38:48,180
Come on.

1271
04:38:48,180 --> 04:39:12,150
It's got a lot of strength still.

1272
04:39:12,150 --> 04:39:21,610
Come on.

1273
04:39:21,610 --> 04:39:23,209
We gotta get fixed up.

1274
04:39:49,349 --> 04:40:08,099
I was waiting for a jump scare.

1275
04:40:08,099 --> 04:40:12,119
One of them is not going to grab me.

1276
04:40:12,119 --> 04:40:24,119
The Undertaker entrance for WrestleMania.

1277
04:40:42,009 --> 04:40:42,889
I loved that song.

1278
04:40:43,450 --> 04:40:43,930
It was great.

1279
04:40:54,330 --> 04:40:55,290
That was the remix version.

1280
04:40:56,330 --> 04:40:57,049
Not the original.

1281
04:40:57,689 --> 04:41:58,299
Fuck, I gotta do it now.

1282
04:41:58,299 --> 04:41:59,180
Never mind.

1283
04:41:59,180 --> 04:42:08,299
He's faking.

1284
04:42:08,299 --> 04:42:09,180
What a faker?

1285
04:42:09,180 --> 04:42:16,119
What do you mean faker?

1286
04:42:16,119 --> 04:42:17,479
He's faking it.

1287
04:42:17,479 --> 04:42:22,729
Have we so fucked up?

1288
04:42:22,729 --> 04:42:23,930
All right, this is the end.

1289
04:42:23,930 --> 04:42:27,159
It was an awesome journey.

1290
04:42:27,159 --> 04:42:28,790
It's time to get to the end.

1291
04:42:53,029 --> 04:42:54,229
By the way, I didn't do it yet.

1292
04:42:54,229 --> 04:42:56,250
I don't know how to do it.

1293
04:42:56,250 --> 04:42:57,369
Yeah, I did this.

1294
04:42:57,369 --> 04:42:59,130
And by the way, in me trying to figure it out,

1295
04:42:59,130 --> 04:43:00,490
I broke two of the lasers.

1296
04:43:01,049 --> 04:43:05,720
You're gonna have to hold one of them

1297
04:43:05,720 --> 04:43:08,069
against your chest for the next four hours.

1298
04:43:08,069 --> 04:43:08,950
Yeah, I found it.

1299
04:43:08,950 --> 04:43:15,110
I think it says we can get out if we can.

1300
04:43:15,110 --> 04:43:17,189
Hey, we're a team, right?

1301
04:43:17,189 --> 04:43:21,060
Keep this up.

1302
04:43:21,060 --> 04:43:21,939
I'll be out of a job.

1303
04:43:24,979 --> 04:43:27,139
Oh yeah, did you draw on the map with the crayon?

1304
04:43:27,139 --> 04:43:31,029
All of this.

1305
04:43:31,029 --> 04:43:33,290
Removing the parasites.

1306
04:43:33,290 --> 04:43:34,169
This was the week.

1307
04:43:35,560 --> 04:43:37,240
Yeah, we're alive.

1308
04:43:38,419 --> 04:43:38,979
Thanks to him.

1309
04:43:39,540 --> 04:43:42,700
I'm surprised this thing even booted up.

1310
04:43:44,279 --> 04:43:46,279
Man, Lewis got this thing going on a raspberry pea?

1311
04:43:48,119 --> 04:43:48,840
That's impressive.

1312
04:43:49,479 --> 04:43:58,060
Do not be fooled into thinking that

1313
04:43:58,060 --> 04:44:01,419
Las Plagas are merely tools for creating powerful bioweapons.

1314
04:44:01,419 --> 04:44:04,139
The true value lies in their ability to control.

1315
04:44:04,139 --> 04:44:06,549
No matter, I've been doing that a lot today,

1316
04:44:06,549 --> 04:44:08,900
that no matter how hostile the subject is,

1317
04:44:08,900 --> 04:44:11,299
single injection can turn anyone into a faithful servant

1318
04:44:11,299 --> 04:44:13,540
who needs spies and you can turn yesterday's enemy

1319
04:44:13,540 --> 04:44:14,580
into today's ally.

1320
04:44:15,139 --> 04:44:17,110
Controlling just one insider

1321
04:44:17,110 --> 04:44:18,630
can bring an entire organization

1322
04:44:18,630 --> 04:44:20,970
or an entire country to its knees.

1323
04:44:22,360 --> 04:44:24,119
Mass production of the superior species

1324
04:44:24,119 --> 04:44:25,720
has made this possible.

1325
04:44:25,720 --> 04:44:28,299
We have empowered Saddler.

1326
04:44:28,299 --> 04:44:32,119
It's clear what he intends to do next.

1327
04:44:32,119 --> 04:44:34,840
Can you imagine if Saddler had that much control?

1328
04:44:35,479 --> 04:44:38,279
Six billion loyal servants at his sole command.

1329
04:44:38,279 --> 04:44:40,630
There'd be no opposition, no war.

1330
04:44:40,630 --> 04:44:43,880
If for the first time in human history,

1331
04:44:44,520 --> 04:44:45,959
the world would know peace.

1332
04:44:45,959 --> 04:44:48,779
But I know how Saddler and the others

1333
04:44:48,779 --> 04:44:51,909
have oppressed the people of this island for generations.

1334
04:44:51,909 --> 04:44:53,029
I know how he treats them.

1335
04:44:53,110 --> 04:44:54,650
That's no way to live.

1336
04:44:54,650 --> 04:45:02,200
And because of that, I won't let it happen.

1337
04:45:02,200 --> 04:45:02,840
Who wrote this?

1338
04:45:06,299 --> 04:45:06,939
Who wrote this?

1339
04:45:14,580 --> 04:45:16,200
That was Louis, okay.

1340
04:45:17,000 --> 04:45:17,479
Makes sense.

1341
04:45:24,380 --> 04:45:26,139
Europe Laboratory Six Dream Team.

1342
04:45:30,330 --> 04:45:31,290
Holy shit, guys.

1343
04:45:31,290 --> 04:45:33,700
Wait, this is Europe Laboratory Six.

1344
04:45:33,700 --> 04:45:36,439
This is Umbrella.

1345
04:45:36,439 --> 04:45:37,159
Holy shit.

1346
04:45:49,750 --> 04:45:50,790
Damn, what's this?

1347
04:45:50,790 --> 04:45:53,189
Someone had a field day looting the Umbrella Labs.

1348
04:46:02,759 --> 04:46:03,799
What the hell was that?

1349
04:46:03,799 --> 04:46:05,959
Any treasures in here?

1350
04:46:09,459 --> 04:46:12,490
First aid spray.

1351
04:46:12,490 --> 04:46:12,990
Okay.

1352
04:46:14,040 --> 04:46:27,259
Let's complete this game.

1353
04:46:27,259 --> 04:46:27,900
Sorry.

1354
04:46:27,900 --> 04:46:28,540
Raspberry P.

1355
04:46:39,400 --> 04:46:39,720
Thank you.

1356
04:46:51,689 --> 04:46:52,169
I think so.

1357
04:46:53,049 --> 04:46:53,930
All right.

1358
04:46:53,930 --> 04:46:55,610
This inventory is a mess.

1359
04:46:55,610 --> 04:47:07,159
This inventory is a mess.

1360
04:47:08,439 --> 04:47:09,560
Why is it such a mess?

1361
04:47:26,330 --> 04:47:40,279
School health.

1362
04:47:40,279 --> 04:47:43,939
Why am I angry?

1363
04:47:43,939 --> 04:47:45,299
Why does everyone think I'm angry today?

1364
04:47:47,270 --> 04:47:47,909
I'm not.

1365
04:47:47,909 --> 04:47:48,389
What?

1366
04:47:48,389 --> 04:47:50,069
Does my brow look weird?

1367
04:47:50,069 --> 04:47:50,869
Does my face look weird?

1368
04:47:50,869 --> 04:47:51,270
What's wrong?

1369
04:47:52,069 --> 04:48:00,979
What do you mean?

1370
04:48:09,430 --> 04:48:10,790
Your face is very mean today.

1371
04:48:11,349 --> 04:48:13,080
I don't know what you're talking about.

1372
04:48:21,060 --> 04:48:21,619
It's a treasure.

1373
04:48:21,619 --> 04:48:22,659
Oh, I'm sure she's fine.

1374
04:48:22,659 --> 04:48:23,139
Eh, we're good.

1375
04:48:23,139 --> 04:48:25,299
She's not the type to roll over that easy.

1376
04:48:25,299 --> 04:48:33,880
That's because you said no roadblocks.

1377
04:48:39,110 --> 04:48:39,830
True.

1378
04:48:39,830 --> 04:48:48,229
Okay.

1379
04:48:48,229 --> 04:48:48,950
Wait.

1380
04:48:48,950 --> 04:48:50,299
Secret.

1381
04:48:54,069 --> 04:48:54,630
No secret?

1382
04:48:55,270 --> 04:48:56,790
Was the secret the other way?

1383
04:48:57,349 --> 04:48:58,840
There are two ways to go.

1384
04:49:00,939 --> 04:49:02,779
Resident Evil more like Resident Sleeper.

1385
04:49:07,049 --> 04:49:13,479
We already went this way.

1386
04:49:13,479 --> 04:49:14,040
Hmm?

1387
04:49:14,040 --> 04:49:16,580
Resident Evil more like Resident Sleeper.

1388
04:49:23,959 --> 04:49:38,900
The final chapter of the Illuminatos.

1389
04:49:39,380 --> 04:49:41,619
Praise be to the holy insects.

1390
04:49:41,619 --> 04:49:44,619
We have been promised paradise on earth.

1391
04:49:44,619 --> 04:49:47,979
Man, woman, or child, his love does not discriminate.

1392
04:49:47,979 --> 04:49:51,099
Beast, fish, or bird, all creatures shall be equally blessed.

1393
04:49:51,099 --> 04:49:53,180
Praise be to the holy insects.

1394
04:49:53,180 --> 04:49:55,020
We are the humble servants of God.

1395
04:49:55,020 --> 04:49:57,270
His wisdom will overcome any mountain.

1396
04:49:57,270 --> 04:50:00,060
His omnipotence will cross any ocean.

1397
04:50:00,060 --> 04:50:03,380
The light of heaven dwells in all things.

1398
04:50:03,380 --> 04:50:05,060
Let our bodies be the seedbed.

1399
04:50:05,959 --> 04:50:07,479
Praise be to the holy insects.

1400
04:50:07,479 --> 04:50:09,639
We are the flock and the shepherd guides us.

1401
04:50:09,639 --> 04:50:12,040
Our prayers will be sung all over the world.

1402
04:50:12,040 --> 04:50:14,069
They will be heard by all.

1403
04:50:14,069 --> 04:50:22,340
At last, we shall exceed the stars in the sky.

1404
04:50:22,340 --> 04:50:29,720
Osmond, deep beneath the castle grounds, I have found my faith.

1405
04:50:29,720 --> 04:50:33,319
Oh, behold, the divine vestiges left upon this world.

1406
04:50:33,319 --> 04:50:34,759
It all begins here.

1407
04:50:34,759 --> 04:50:35,560
Adam Sandler.

1408
04:50:36,119 --> 04:50:39,130
Oh, nice.

1409
04:50:39,130 --> 04:50:50,599
Get out of here.

1410
04:50:50,599 --> 04:51:07,750
I think I have to go that way.

1411
04:51:12,860 --> 04:51:15,259
Lord and Savior, Adam Sandler.

1412
04:51:22,549 --> 04:51:22,790
Yes.

1413
04:51:28,580 --> 04:51:29,060
Treasures?

1414
04:51:29,779 --> 04:51:30,099
Yep.

1415
04:51:30,099 --> 04:51:31,459
There are two treasures in here.

1416
04:51:37,459 --> 04:51:47,450
What are you doing?

1417
04:52:06,599 --> 04:52:07,240
Got it.

1418
04:52:07,240 --> 04:52:09,450
There's one more.

1419
04:52:09,450 --> 04:52:11,900
It's in this room.

1420
04:52:11,900 --> 04:52:16,090
I think this is it.

1421
04:52:16,090 --> 04:52:17,830
Wow.

1422
04:52:17,830 --> 04:52:19,590
I'm pretty sure this is it.

1423
04:52:19,590 --> 04:52:21,110
This is the this is the end here.

1424
04:52:21,110 --> 04:52:21,909
I think this is the end.

1425
04:52:46,599 --> 04:52:47,720
Is it time to sell everything?

1426
04:52:56,250 --> 04:52:57,849
I think about time to sell literally everything.

1427
04:53:02,069 --> 04:53:04,630
Because I think this is actually the last place to see him.

1428
04:53:04,630 --> 04:53:06,310
That's our choice to make.

1429
04:53:06,310 --> 04:53:07,189
I think it's time to do it.

1430
04:53:09,369 --> 04:53:11,770
If you can't beat the jet ski escape within three tries,

1431
04:53:11,770 --> 04:53:15,029
you have to play Roblox for one hour on your birthday.

1432
04:53:15,029 --> 04:53:15,349
Right.

1433
04:53:15,349 --> 04:53:15,590
Okay.

1434
04:53:16,150 --> 04:53:19,720
Don't sell the key.

1435
04:53:19,720 --> 04:53:20,200
I already did.

1436
04:53:21,400 --> 04:53:22,680
Sell all your weapons, too.

1437
04:53:23,560 --> 04:53:24,040
Everything.

1438
04:53:25,689 --> 04:53:31,450
Sell everything and then walk out with nothing.

1439
04:53:37,819 --> 04:53:38,459
I think that's good.

1440
04:53:43,639 --> 04:53:44,360
Final tune up.

1441
04:53:52,970 --> 04:53:53,930
This is all good.

1442
04:53:53,930 --> 04:53:54,169
All right.

1443
04:53:54,169 --> 04:53:55,450
We can do we can do this.

1444
04:53:55,450 --> 04:53:57,130
Let's do ammo capacity.

1445
04:53:57,930 --> 04:53:59,130
See how that feels.

1446
04:53:59,130 --> 04:54:03,049
And then a fellow like yourself should notice whatever I can do with this.

1447
04:54:03,770 --> 04:54:06,009
This kind of work is about finesse.

1448
04:54:07,909 --> 04:54:11,430
You've exhausted our normal range of services for this weapon.

1449
04:54:11,430 --> 04:54:11,750
All right.

1450
04:54:11,750 --> 04:54:12,630
This thing's good to go.

1451
04:54:12,630 --> 04:54:13,430
Too bad I couldn't get it.

1452
04:54:14,310 --> 04:54:14,790
But it's all good.

1453
04:54:15,590 --> 04:54:19,259
You catch my drift.

1454
04:54:19,259 --> 04:54:20,299
Buy the RPG.

1455
04:54:21,560 --> 04:54:22,680
Now I'm good.

1456
04:54:24,520 --> 04:54:25,319
Gotta come back.

1457
04:54:26,119 --> 04:54:36,020
Now we're good.

1458
04:54:36,500 --> 04:54:37,220
Any time.

1459
04:54:38,470 --> 04:54:38,790
All right.

1460
04:54:38,790 --> 04:54:40,869
I've got my sniper rifle.

1461
04:54:40,869 --> 04:54:43,290
My Omega shotgun.

1462
04:54:43,290 --> 04:54:47,450
20 shots with a times almost two damage on the broken butterfly.

1463
04:54:47,450 --> 04:54:50,310
This is going to be perfect.

1464
04:54:50,310 --> 04:54:51,270
RPG.

1465
04:54:51,270 --> 04:54:52,580
What do you mean?

1466
04:54:52,580 --> 04:54:53,939
Buy the RPG or you.

1467
04:54:54,500 --> 04:54:58,970
I don't want the RPG.

1468
04:55:03,220 --> 04:55:04,099
I got what I want.

1469
04:55:05,180 --> 04:55:09,900
And that's 20 shots with a quadruple damage magnum.

1470
04:55:10,860 --> 04:55:13,290
48 slugs.

1471
04:55:13,290 --> 04:55:13,849
I'm ready.

1472
04:55:13,849 --> 04:55:14,889
I'm unloading everything.

1473
04:55:19,029 --> 04:55:19,590
Anything?

1474
04:55:19,590 --> 04:55:22,919
I customize anything here at this point.

1475
04:55:22,919 --> 04:55:28,860
I don't think it matters.

1476
04:55:28,860 --> 04:55:29,750
Maybe the healing.

1477
04:55:30,310 --> 04:55:32,150
Yeah, that's fine.

1478
04:55:32,150 --> 04:55:32,310
All right.

1479
04:55:32,310 --> 04:55:32,630
Let's go.

1480
04:55:33,270 --> 04:55:36,229
Send it.

1481
04:55:36,790 --> 04:55:42,659
Can we wager that you will miss the first shot with the magnum?

1482
04:55:42,659 --> 04:55:42,900
Sure.

1483
04:55:43,459 --> 04:55:44,220
Good.

1484
04:55:44,220 --> 04:55:44,700
Make a bet.

1485
04:55:45,509 --> 04:55:47,990
Will I miss the first shot I do with the magnum?

1486
04:55:51,099 --> 04:55:51,500
Go for it.

1487
04:55:52,060 --> 04:55:53,049
Go ahead and vote.

1488
04:55:53,990 --> 04:55:54,630
You can bet that.

1489
04:55:56,599 --> 04:55:57,319
Now, wait, wait, wait.

1490
04:55:57,319 --> 04:55:58,360
What constitutes a miss?

1491
04:55:58,360 --> 04:55:58,919
That's important.

1492
04:55:59,479 --> 04:56:01,529
Like a complete miss.

1493
04:56:01,529 --> 04:56:02,970
Don't hit any body part at all.

1494
04:56:03,610 --> 04:56:06,889
Or I have to hit the exact spot that that matters.

1495
04:56:06,970 --> 04:56:08,330
Like the weakness part.

1496
04:56:08,970 --> 04:56:10,970
We need to make that clear.

1497
04:56:10,970 --> 04:56:13,209
We're talking about no damage, a complete miss.

1498
04:56:13,209 --> 04:56:14,090
Just a complete miss.

1499
04:56:16,860 --> 04:56:17,180
Okay.

1500
04:56:17,180 --> 04:56:17,979
Or weak spot.

1501
04:56:17,979 --> 04:56:18,299
Okay.

1502
04:56:18,860 --> 04:56:21,020
So if I miss the weak spot with the first shot,

1503
04:56:21,020 --> 04:56:23,099
then you can go ahead and pay everybody out.

1504
04:56:23,740 --> 04:56:25,900
If I hit the weak spot with the first shot,

1505
04:56:25,900 --> 04:56:26,939
then you lose.

1506
04:56:26,939 --> 04:56:28,540
And everybody else that's betting on me wins.

1507
04:56:29,180 --> 04:56:31,319
The weak spot.

1508
04:56:31,319 --> 04:56:31,880
No, I'll hit it.

1509
04:56:31,880 --> 04:56:32,360
That's easy.

1510
04:56:33,080 --> 04:56:33,479
I'm telling you.

1511
04:56:33,479 --> 04:56:33,880
That's simple.

1512
04:56:36,389 --> 04:56:37,029
It's I'm telling you.

1513
04:56:37,029 --> 04:56:37,830
It's simple.

1514
04:56:37,830 --> 04:56:38,759
I'll be fine.

1515
04:56:52,889 --> 04:56:59,000
Ada thinks he's going to lure me out.

1516
04:57:00,090 --> 04:57:00,889
Well, it worked.

1517
04:57:01,290 --> 04:57:02,009
Because here we come.

1518
04:57:05,689 --> 04:57:06,169
Stay here.

1519
04:57:06,729 --> 04:57:07,619
I won't be long.

1520
04:57:23,540 --> 04:57:31,450
A heads up would have been a little more appreciated probably.

1521
04:57:56,569 --> 04:57:58,569
Real missed opportunity for him to be like,

1522
04:57:58,569 --> 04:58:00,779
you'll never get away with this.

1523
04:58:01,500 --> 04:58:02,459
That would have been perfect.

1524
04:58:12,740 --> 04:58:12,979
All right.

1525
04:58:12,979 --> 04:58:14,340
I got to focus because I don't want to miss it.

1526
04:58:45,750 --> 04:58:46,950
I know where the weak parts are.

1527
04:59:00,729 --> 04:59:01,049
Got it.

1528
04:59:25,479 --> 04:59:27,000
Oh, that stings.

1529
04:59:53,500 --> 04:59:58,900
Oh, oh, please.

1530
05:00:12,630 --> 05:00:14,790
I have so much shit in my inventory.

1531
05:00:28,840 --> 05:00:29,560
Get away from me.

1532
05:00:36,229 --> 05:01:15,590
Oh, oh, I had to end it with the shotgun.

1533
05:01:15,590 --> 05:01:30,180
Getting sick of your shit.

1534
05:01:59,430 --> 05:02:00,310
Oh, my God.

1535
05:02:00,310 --> 05:02:01,750
That was a lot of damage, though.

1536
05:02:33,020 --> 05:02:37,819
See you later.

1537
05:02:37,819 --> 05:02:38,619
Give me that shit.

1538
05:02:49,560 --> 05:02:51,159
All 50 shots almost.

1539
05:03:02,380 --> 05:03:11,849
Worked out pretty well.

1540
05:03:11,849 --> 05:03:12,569
That was pretty cool.

1541
05:03:23,240 --> 05:03:25,400
And he take if you don't do the rocket launcher thing,

1542
05:03:25,400 --> 05:03:26,919
he takes a lot of hits at the end there.

1543
05:03:26,919 --> 05:03:42,540
50 slugs, Steven does it again.

1544
05:03:42,540 --> 05:03:43,500
Nothing personal, Leon.

1545
05:03:43,500 --> 05:03:45,750
Luis and I had an arrangement.

1546
05:03:45,750 --> 05:03:48,970
I'll take good care of it.

1547
05:03:48,970 --> 05:03:51,349
What was it?

1548
05:03:51,349 --> 05:03:54,229
Three attempts or I have to play Roblox on April 5th or whatever it is?

1549
05:03:54,869 --> 05:03:55,740
Fight's here.

1550
05:03:56,619 --> 05:04:03,000
We both know this.

1551
05:04:03,720 --> 05:04:05,159
It's where we go our separate ways.

1552
05:04:09,220 --> 05:04:09,619
I see.

1553
05:04:10,500 --> 05:04:22,020
I wonder how hard that is on hardcore and professional.

1554
05:04:22,020 --> 05:04:23,380
Professional's probably a joke.

1555
05:04:23,380 --> 05:04:24,580
Better get a move on.

1556
05:04:24,580 --> 05:04:27,380
Am I a joke as in almost impossible?

1557
05:04:27,380 --> 05:04:47,639
Where is she going?

1558
05:04:47,639 --> 05:04:48,599
Who knows?

1559
05:04:48,599 --> 05:04:49,400
I don't understand.

1560
05:04:49,400 --> 05:04:50,040
Why would she just?

1561
05:04:50,840 --> 05:04:52,040
I'm gonna move.

1562
05:04:52,040 --> 05:04:53,159
Island's gonna blow.

1563
05:04:53,159 --> 05:04:53,659
Go.

1564
05:05:00,060 --> 05:05:00,700
Go.

1565
05:05:00,700 --> 05:05:01,259
Time to run.

1566
05:05:01,900 --> 05:05:09,779
We got two minutes to get out of here.

1567
05:05:14,729 --> 05:05:25,900
Anything else?

1568
05:05:26,979 --> 05:05:27,220
Why?

1569
05:05:27,220 --> 05:05:27,860
Who cares if you go?

1570
05:05:36,810 --> 05:05:37,290
Not yet.

1571
05:05:52,580 --> 05:05:55,060
Keep up the pace.

1572
05:05:55,060 --> 05:05:55,540
Jesus.

1573
05:05:56,340 --> 05:06:03,299
What's going on there?

1574
05:06:03,299 --> 05:06:13,580
I love this rat.

1575
05:06:14,139 --> 05:06:15,900
Can we take one of the rats with us?

1576
05:06:18,279 --> 05:06:18,759
Open it.

1577
05:06:20,700 --> 05:06:21,979
Go, go, go, go, go.

1578
05:06:49,900 --> 05:06:50,779
Let's do it.

1579
05:06:50,779 --> 05:06:51,340
All right.

1580
05:06:51,340 --> 05:06:52,060
Don't fuck it up.

1581
05:06:52,060 --> 05:06:53,259
I got three tries.

1582
05:06:55,189 --> 05:06:56,229
We got to play Roblox.

1583
05:07:15,369 --> 05:07:16,650
It's pretty forgiving.

1584
05:07:16,650 --> 05:07:17,770
It's kind of, it's forgiving.

1585
05:07:17,770 --> 05:07:18,250
I'm all right.

1586
05:08:18,580 --> 05:08:20,810
I did it.

1587
05:08:20,810 --> 05:08:21,209
I win.

1588
05:08:24,889 --> 05:08:26,729
Happy birthday to you.

1589
05:08:41,979 --> 05:08:43,340
Baby, what is this title?

1590
05:08:43,340 --> 05:08:45,180
What is going on in the title right now?

1591
05:08:45,180 --> 05:08:59,849
Mission accomplished, right?

1592
05:08:59,849 --> 05:09:04,900
Mission accomplished.

1593
05:09:04,900 --> 05:09:05,380
I'm safe.

1594
05:09:06,340 --> 05:09:07,380
Ashley B.

1595
05:09:07,380 --> 05:09:08,500
Thank you for saving me.

1596
05:09:08,500 --> 05:09:09,459
Jet Ski's out of gas.

1597
05:09:10,259 --> 05:09:10,979
Don't mention it.

1598
05:09:10,979 --> 05:09:13,540
And I only brought one more bologna and cheese sandwich.

1599
05:09:13,540 --> 05:09:15,220
I could put an award with my dad.

1600
05:09:15,220 --> 05:09:15,459
Where?

1601
05:09:15,459 --> 05:09:15,700
Fuck.

1602
05:09:15,700 --> 05:09:17,060
Have you assigned to my detail?

1603
05:09:17,060 --> 05:09:17,860
If you're interested.

1604
05:09:19,540 --> 05:09:20,259
You don't need me.

1605
05:09:20,819 --> 05:09:23,020
You proved you could handle yourself.

1606
05:09:23,659 --> 05:09:26,389
Even if you could use a lesson in knife safety.

1607
05:09:27,669 --> 05:09:28,700
Come on.

1608
05:09:29,819 --> 05:09:30,459
Let's go home.

1609
05:09:32,139 --> 05:09:44,060
Rooster Condor 1, do you read me?

1610
05:09:44,060 --> 05:09:47,020
We are not making it back to America.

1611
05:09:47,020 --> 05:09:48,619
Is this thing even on?

1612
05:09:48,619 --> 05:09:51,020
Like four gallons of gas.

1613
05:09:51,020 --> 05:09:52,459
Whatever it takes in a Jet Ski.

1614
05:09:52,459 --> 05:09:53,659
Where are we?

1615
05:09:53,659 --> 05:09:55,990
There's like three gallons.

1616
05:09:56,549 --> 05:10:08,340
That's great.

1617
05:10:20,299 --> 05:10:21,259
If you liked it.

1618
05:10:21,259 --> 05:10:22,700
If you liked Resident Evil 4

1619
05:10:22,779 --> 05:10:24,459
and you're trying to figure out if you should get the remake.

1620
05:10:24,459 --> 05:10:25,020
You should.

1621
05:10:25,020 --> 05:10:25,819
Absolutely.

1622
05:10:25,819 --> 05:10:26,540
That's phenomenal.

1623
05:10:29,270 --> 05:10:30,310
And it's Resident Evil 4.

1624
05:10:30,310 --> 05:10:31,349
Of course it is.

1625
05:10:31,349 --> 05:10:51,669
Why'd you take the label off your chapstick?

1626
05:10:51,669 --> 05:10:52,150
I didn't.

1627
05:10:53,080 --> 05:10:54,840
It's like it's in a tube.

1628
05:10:55,400 --> 05:10:57,880
It goes like like a little closer.

1629
05:11:02,380 --> 05:11:04,380
It's like Trader Joe's.

1630
05:11:04,380 --> 05:11:05,819
Trader Joe's cucumber mint.

1631
05:11:06,810 --> 05:11:07,290
It's like a...

1632
05:11:30,389 --> 05:11:38,009
So the Plaga storyline goes through six.

1633
05:11:38,009 --> 05:11:39,689
And then the mold is seven up.

1634
05:11:40,409 --> 05:11:43,209
And then the virus, the T-virus is one, two, three.

1635
05:11:43,849 --> 05:11:44,650
Or the virus.

1636
05:11:45,369 --> 05:11:56,229
Do you think they'll remake five and six?

1637
05:11:58,299 --> 05:12:00,700
Judging by how well these do, I think.

1638
05:12:00,700 --> 05:12:02,299
And how much people really like these.

1639
05:12:03,180 --> 05:12:04,549
I don't know if they're going to do six.

1640
05:12:04,549 --> 05:12:07,029
But five is probably up next in a few years.

1641
05:12:07,029 --> 05:12:07,590
I would imagine.

1642
05:12:10,779 --> 05:12:11,500
I think six is...

1643
05:12:12,060 --> 05:12:13,259
I think you just percent...

1644
05:12:13,259 --> 05:12:15,259
I think you just pretend six didn't just never existed.

1645
05:12:23,220 --> 05:12:23,540
I don't know.

1646
05:12:23,540 --> 05:12:24,659
You'd have to remake the whole game.

1647
05:12:24,659 --> 05:12:26,099
Six was just not a good game either.

1648
05:12:27,049 --> 05:12:28,650
Four and five were good games.

1649
05:12:28,650 --> 05:12:29,930
To me, six was not a good game.

1650
05:12:29,930 --> 05:12:31,049
Six was a pretty bad game.

1651
05:12:31,689 --> 05:12:34,970
So you'd have to do a lot to make a remake of six, I think, better.

1652
05:12:34,970 --> 05:12:36,250
I've obtained the amber.

1653
05:12:36,889 --> 05:12:38,330
Excellent.

1654
05:12:38,889 --> 05:12:41,669
Just one question.

1655
05:12:42,389 --> 05:12:44,180
What are you planning to do with this?

1656
05:12:44,979 --> 05:12:47,700
Do not pay you to ask questions.

1657
05:12:48,500 --> 05:12:53,369
You need to know, as a new dawn is breaking.

1658
05:12:54,250 --> 05:12:57,849
A hundred will give their lives so that just one may live.

1659
05:12:59,700 --> 05:13:03,209
I, expediting that change.

1660
05:13:03,849 --> 05:13:08,889
So, we're talking millions of casualties.

1661
05:13:10,340 --> 05:13:10,979
Billions.

1662
05:13:14,220 --> 05:13:14,939
How ambitious.

1663
05:13:20,380 --> 05:13:21,740
We're changing course.

1664
05:13:21,740 --> 05:13:22,380
Now.

1665
05:13:22,380 --> 05:13:30,919
I think five was kind of polarizing.

1666
05:13:30,919 --> 05:13:32,520
But I really liked five.

1667
05:13:32,520 --> 05:13:33,560
I thought five was really fun.

1668
05:13:36,150 --> 05:13:39,909
Five was kind of four, but a little more stuff.

1669
05:13:39,909 --> 05:13:40,310
A little...

1670
05:13:40,310 --> 05:13:41,909
It had the whole co-op, right?

1671
05:13:41,909 --> 05:13:42,630
That was a lot of fun.

1672
05:13:46,279 --> 05:13:47,799
I think people give five a lot of shit.

1673
05:13:47,799 --> 05:13:48,759
I thought five was really good.

1674
05:13:50,459 --> 05:13:51,979
I don't think it's as good as four, but I think it's...

1675
05:13:52,540 --> 05:13:53,819
It was a worthy sequel, I think.

1676
05:13:58,919 --> 05:14:00,439
Six, they just went completely...

1677
05:14:01,639 --> 05:14:02,840
It was a mess.

1678
05:14:04,180 --> 05:14:05,220
Six, I don't even...

1679
05:14:05,220 --> 05:14:06,900
Honestly, I've played six recently.

1680
05:14:07,720 --> 05:14:08,919
And I don't even remember it.

1681
05:14:10,330 --> 05:14:11,130
I have no idea.

1682
05:14:18,470 --> 05:14:19,110
Seven was good.

1683
05:14:20,549 --> 05:14:22,389
Yeah, the new arc was fun.

1684
05:14:23,419 --> 05:14:29,060
I like seven and eight.

1685
05:14:29,060 --> 05:14:30,259
Yeah, me and italics played it.

1686
05:14:38,840 --> 05:14:39,720
Yeah, the new ones were good.

1687
05:14:39,720 --> 05:14:40,279
I liked them both.

1688
05:14:46,939 --> 05:14:50,220
The two remake was hard to beat when it comes to remake.

1689
05:14:50,220 --> 05:14:51,819
But I think they came pretty close on this one.

1690
05:14:52,619 --> 05:14:58,009
I love this franchise.

1691
05:14:58,009 --> 05:14:58,810
It's a great franchise.

1692
05:15:02,970 --> 05:15:05,130
Resident Evil is one of the only franchises I can really think of

1693
05:15:05,849 --> 05:15:11,139
that has actually continued to do really, really great games.

1694
05:15:12,250 --> 05:15:12,889
This far.

1695
05:15:13,450 --> 05:15:15,689
This laid into the whole franchise.

1696
05:15:19,860 --> 05:15:20,740
They're still making...

1697
05:15:20,740 --> 05:15:22,740
I mean, you know, Resident Evil is seven and eight.

1698
05:15:22,740 --> 05:15:24,020
Where a lot of people, you know...

1699
05:15:24,819 --> 05:15:25,849
I think they were good.

1700
05:15:26,729 --> 05:15:29,290
I think that they're from one through eight.

1701
05:15:30,819 --> 05:15:33,459
Only one or two of them are really not that great.

1702
05:15:34,419 --> 05:15:38,500
I think as a whole, the whole franchise has been doing really well still.

1703
05:15:39,220 --> 05:15:39,939
So it's really cool.

1704
05:15:39,939 --> 05:15:41,060
I mean, I love Resident Evil.

1705
05:15:41,060 --> 05:15:41,619
I always have.

1706
05:15:42,580 --> 05:15:46,060
You said eight's ending was shitty.

1707
05:15:47,020 --> 05:15:48,700
Yeah, but the game as a whole was fun.

1708
05:15:49,500 --> 05:15:50,779
It was worth playing.

1709
05:15:50,779 --> 05:15:52,139
It was worthy to play it.

1710
05:15:52,139 --> 05:15:52,619
It was good.

1711
05:15:53,259 --> 05:16:05,369
Listen to this song.

1712
05:16:05,369 --> 05:16:13,849
You should play Mercenaries when it comes out.

1713
05:16:14,970 --> 05:16:15,689
Yeah, what's the new...

1714
05:16:15,689 --> 05:16:18,810
What's the content release schedule for this?

1715
05:16:19,610 --> 05:16:20,810
Because there's a couple of things, right?

1716
05:16:20,889 --> 05:16:22,970
There's the little spoilers, but...

1717
05:16:25,319 --> 05:16:26,279
Ada's campaign.

1718
05:16:30,360 --> 05:16:31,080
April 7th.

1719
05:16:31,080 --> 05:16:31,799
That's it, really.

1720
05:16:32,599 --> 05:16:33,319
Drops next week.

1721
05:16:33,319 --> 05:16:33,799
Oh, shit.

1722
05:16:33,799 --> 05:16:34,119
All right.

1723
05:16:37,139 --> 05:16:38,900
Are we gonna get the Ada, please?

1724
05:16:39,619 --> 05:16:40,180
Play through?

1725
05:16:40,180 --> 05:16:41,220
Or is that probably gonna be DLC?

1726
05:16:42,099 --> 05:16:46,759
Hasn't been announced.

1727
05:16:46,759 --> 05:16:51,049
That's cool, though.

1728
05:16:51,049 --> 05:16:53,560
Yeah, Mercenaries was a ton of fun.

1729
05:16:53,560 --> 05:16:57,000
I dumped hours and hours and hours into it when it first came out.

1730
05:16:59,849 --> 05:17:00,490
Long time ago.

1731
05:17:01,049 --> 05:17:05,159
All right, well, we have to spend our currency.

1732
05:17:06,330 --> 05:17:09,529
I have like 20,000 of it or something.

1733
05:17:09,529 --> 05:17:10,409
Let's go to the bonuses.

1734
05:17:13,479 --> 05:17:15,799
Yeah, I'm not even gonna give you a rating.

1735
05:17:15,799 --> 05:17:16,759
You know what it is.

1736
05:17:16,759 --> 05:17:18,840
It's at least a nine plus.

1737
05:17:18,840 --> 05:17:19,319
It just is.

1738
05:17:20,119 --> 05:17:22,040
Resident Evil 4 is one of the best games ever made.

1739
05:17:22,040 --> 05:17:23,479
This was a great remake.

1740
05:17:24,279 --> 05:17:26,340
They did a very, very good job.

1741
05:17:26,340 --> 05:17:28,900
How do you tackle a game like this everybody loves?

1742
05:17:29,459 --> 05:17:31,060
And it's some people's favorite game ever made.

1743
05:17:31,060 --> 05:17:32,020
I think they did a really good job.

1744
05:17:32,500 --> 05:17:33,540
I think it's worth buying, for sure.

1745
05:17:37,669 --> 05:17:39,189
The old one is still good to go back to,

1746
05:17:39,189 --> 05:17:40,709
but I think they did a justice, for sure.

1747
05:17:41,349 --> 05:17:41,909
Great.

1748
05:17:41,909 --> 05:17:54,250
They redeemed themselves after the Resident Evil 3 remake.

1749
05:17:54,810 --> 05:17:55,849
Oh, yeah, 100%.

1750
05:18:00,330 --> 05:18:02,860
Absolutely.

1751
05:18:02,860 --> 05:18:04,860
The third remake was, it was all right.

1752
05:18:06,169 --> 05:18:09,860
Looking back with some time, it was all right.

1753
05:18:09,860 --> 05:18:13,209
Could have been a lot better.

1754
05:18:13,209 --> 05:18:16,869
But remember, they were coming right off of Resident Evil 2's remake,

1755
05:18:16,869 --> 05:18:20,549
which is, I mean, that was game of the year for me, for a lot of people.

1756
05:18:21,740 --> 05:18:23,819
So right after that, it's like, oh, Resident Evil 3 remake.

1757
05:18:23,819 --> 05:18:25,500
It's gonna be so, it's gonna be just as good as two.

1758
05:18:25,500 --> 05:18:28,139
It's not even close to as good as the second remake.

1759
05:18:28,139 --> 05:18:28,540
Oh, no.

1760
05:18:29,639 --> 05:18:33,159
But if a game is a 7 versus like a 10, that's kind of unfair.

1761
05:18:33,159 --> 05:18:34,599
Like that game was like,

1762
05:18:34,599 --> 05:18:37,319
Resident Evil 2 was like a 9.8 for me, the remake.

1763
05:18:38,939 --> 05:18:41,500
You go right from that to like a solid, but like, hmm.

1764
05:18:41,500 --> 05:18:43,830
There's some, eh, it was all right.

1765
05:18:43,830 --> 05:18:44,869
Hard to do that.

1766
05:18:44,869 --> 05:18:47,509
Especially after Resident Evil 2's remake.

1767
05:18:47,509 --> 05:18:53,540
Just kind of rushed, yeah.

1768
05:18:53,540 --> 05:18:54,259
It was fine.

1769
05:18:54,259 --> 05:18:58,380
It was all right.

1770
05:18:58,380 --> 05:18:59,259
All right, I think we're good.

1771
05:19:01,029 --> 05:19:01,990
Should I just skip this, I think?

1772
05:19:02,709 --> 05:19:03,590
Probably.

1773
05:19:03,590 --> 05:19:12,919
Hold on, I want to listen to this song for a second.

1774
05:19:12,919 --> 05:19:23,340
What about the Dead Space remake?

1775
05:19:23,340 --> 05:19:24,380
Do you guys want to see that?

1776
05:19:24,380 --> 05:19:25,340
Should I play that on stream?

1777
05:19:31,860 --> 05:19:32,500
Yeah.

1778
05:19:32,500 --> 05:19:35,819
Should I play the remake or should I play the original one?

1779
05:19:36,380 --> 05:19:38,119
I heard the remake is really good.

1780
05:19:38,680 --> 05:19:40,040
So I'm imagining probably the remake.

1781
05:19:44,150 --> 05:19:44,709
You'd like it?

1782
05:19:45,270 --> 05:19:46,150
Cool.

1783
05:19:46,150 --> 05:19:50,500
All right, let's skip.

1784
05:19:51,060 --> 05:19:52,520
Get to the end.

1785
05:19:53,080 --> 05:19:55,380
Quiet.

1786
05:19:55,380 --> 05:20:10,459
Congratulations.

1787
05:20:11,020 --> 05:20:13,020
Good work.

1788
05:20:13,020 --> 05:20:13,500
Not gonna be.

1789
05:20:16,860 --> 05:20:17,340
Not gonna be.

1790
05:20:17,900 --> 05:20:23,319
Is it because I saved 114 times?

1791
05:20:23,319 --> 05:20:25,479
Is it because I saved 100 plus times?

1792
05:20:26,380 --> 05:20:27,819
If this was less than 100, it would have been A.

1793
05:20:31,000 --> 05:20:32,840
I just spam the save because it's like,

1794
05:20:33,000 --> 05:20:34,200
I sold this thing.

1795
05:20:34,200 --> 05:20:34,919
Save it.

1796
05:20:34,919 --> 05:20:36,200
Oh, I broke that thing.

1797
05:20:36,200 --> 05:20:37,000
Turn around, save it.

1798
05:20:37,000 --> 05:20:37,639
I just saved it.

1799
05:20:37,639 --> 05:20:38,919
I saved it one minute ago?

1800
05:20:38,919 --> 05:20:40,040
Did I save it one minute ago?

1801
05:20:40,040 --> 05:20:41,080
Just to be sure, save it again.

1802
05:20:44,009 --> 05:20:45,770
One save every 10 minutes.

1803
05:20:48,819 --> 05:20:49,779
It's just for time?

1804
05:20:49,779 --> 05:20:51,060
Okay, that's fine.

1805
05:20:51,060 --> 05:20:57,740
Complete the main story on standard or higher.

1806
05:21:01,110 --> 05:21:02,549
Unlocked a costume.

1807
05:21:02,549 --> 05:21:04,150
I got the pinstripe costume,

1808
05:21:06,380 --> 05:21:09,259
brown sunglasses and a foam mask

1809
05:21:10,119 --> 05:21:11,400
and a flight cap.

1810
05:21:12,979 --> 05:21:13,540
Cool.

1811
05:21:13,540 --> 05:21:20,759
Okay.

1812
05:21:20,759 --> 05:21:23,860
So I mean, I want to do this, right?

1813
05:21:28,779 --> 05:21:29,580
New playthrough.

1814
05:21:38,889 --> 05:21:40,009
All right, let's do the bonuses then.

1815
05:21:40,650 --> 05:21:42,169
Professional mode has been unlocked.

1816
05:21:44,759 --> 05:21:46,279
All right, extra content.

1817
05:21:46,279 --> 05:21:49,590
I got 21,000.

1818
05:21:53,430 --> 05:22:03,139
Buy everything.

1819
05:22:03,139 --> 05:22:03,619
Jacket.

1820
05:22:09,479 --> 05:22:09,799
All right.

1821
05:22:09,799 --> 05:22:10,439
Whoa, what's this?

1822
05:22:17,110 --> 05:22:17,830
Cool.

1823
05:22:17,830 --> 05:22:21,180
All right, hold on.

1824
05:22:21,180 --> 05:22:33,189
I think I have enough to get everything

1825
05:22:33,189 --> 05:22:33,909
or at least most.

1826
05:22:34,869 --> 05:23:04,790
Whoa, this is concept art.

1827
05:23:04,790 --> 05:23:06,490
I want to see this.

1828
05:23:06,490 --> 05:23:08,419
I want to see this.

1829
05:23:08,419 --> 05:23:09,909
I want to see this.

1830
05:23:10,549 --> 05:23:11,580
I want to see this.

1831
05:23:12,299 --> 05:23:12,939
I want to see this.

1832
05:23:13,659 --> 05:23:16,459
I want this.

1833
05:23:16,459 --> 05:23:17,450
I want this.

1834
05:23:19,799 --> 05:23:20,299
I want this.

1835
05:23:21,529 --> 05:23:22,029
This.

1836
05:23:22,830 --> 05:23:23,330
This.

1837
05:23:31,819 --> 05:23:32,319
This.

1838
05:23:33,310 --> 05:23:33,810
This.

1839
05:23:34,479 --> 05:23:34,979
This.

1840
05:23:45,400 --> 05:23:45,720
Weapons.

1841
05:23:45,720 --> 05:23:46,439
Get the weapons.

1842
05:23:47,000 --> 05:23:48,360
I can't, I don't have any.

1843
05:23:48,360 --> 05:23:55,759
At least unlock the cool models first.

1844
05:23:55,759 --> 05:23:56,000
What?

1845
05:23:56,000 --> 05:24:24,810
These are the cool ones.

1846
05:24:24,810 --> 05:24:25,369
All right.

1847
05:24:25,369 --> 05:24:42,759
Ooh, scary.

1848
05:24:42,759 --> 05:24:52,540
Hate these things.

1849
05:24:52,540 --> 05:25:06,349
Cool.

1850
05:25:06,349 --> 05:25:08,430
Look at that.

1851
05:25:08,430 --> 05:25:18,939
This looks really real somehow.

1852
05:25:18,939 --> 05:25:19,979
The shadows.

1853
05:25:19,979 --> 05:25:42,490
Okay.

1854
05:25:42,490 --> 05:25:43,689
Oh, pinstripe Leon.

1855
05:25:43,689 --> 05:25:45,369
Does pinstripe Leon say anything else?

1856
05:25:45,369 --> 05:26:35,040
I wish I had the whole playthrough with this.

1857
05:26:35,040 --> 05:26:39,040
Why do they have like Woody from Toy Story?

1858
05:26:39,040 --> 05:26:41,360
You pull the string.

1859
05:26:41,360 --> 05:27:04,619
Got a lot of stuff.

1860
05:27:04,619 --> 05:27:16,919
That's the one that goes,

1861
05:27:16,919 --> 05:27:17,959
Ah, yes, sir.

1862
05:27:17,959 --> 05:27:20,159
Right from the other one.

1863
05:27:20,159 --> 05:27:25,049
Oh, yep.

1864
05:27:25,049 --> 05:27:42,119
Ah, weird.

1865
05:27:42,119 --> 05:28:04,090
I just stepped on my router.

1866
05:28:04,090 --> 05:28:13,040
Just felt like, damn.

1867
05:28:13,040 --> 05:28:31,849
These guys were cool.

1868
05:28:31,849 --> 05:28:33,950
This was a cool.

1869
05:28:33,950 --> 05:28:35,470
I don't think these guys were in the old game.

1870
05:28:35,470 --> 05:28:36,509
So that's cool.

1871
05:28:36,509 --> 05:29:07,049
Bebop and Rocksteady.

1872
05:29:07,049 --> 05:29:08,009
Ah, these guys.

1873
05:29:12,830 --> 05:29:13,330
These guys.

1874
05:29:58,970 --> 05:30:03,159
It's kind of lame.

1875
05:30:04,119 --> 05:30:07,080
Oh, the biggest, scariest guy in the whole game.

1876
05:30:07,080 --> 05:30:08,439
The ultimate villain.

1877
05:30:08,439 --> 05:30:11,639
I am Osman Saddler.

1878
05:30:11,639 --> 05:30:12,990
It's just kind of like,

1879
05:30:12,990 --> 05:30:14,590
you could have done a different voice.

1880
05:30:14,590 --> 05:30:17,290
A different voice line than that.

1881
05:30:17,290 --> 05:30:21,759
That was just stating your name.

1882
05:30:21,759 --> 05:30:23,759
Not like, you will never escape me.

1883
05:30:23,759 --> 05:30:25,119
It has to be just kind of,

1884
05:30:25,119 --> 05:30:52,220
hey, this is who I am.

1885
05:30:52,220 --> 05:30:52,720
Cute.

1886
05:30:59,049 --> 05:31:08,189
Hey, did you have fun playing Resident Evil 4?

1887
05:31:08,189 --> 05:31:12,240
Did you like how much ammo you found?

1888
05:31:12,240 --> 05:31:16,540
Do you like Osman Saddler?

1889
05:31:17,720 --> 05:31:19,290
I didn't think so.

1890
05:31:19,290 --> 05:31:20,799
Are you smart?

1891
05:31:20,880 --> 05:31:21,919
Yeah, are you good?

1892
05:31:22,479 --> 05:31:25,040
Okay, now get out of here.

1893
05:31:25,040 --> 05:31:32,159
Oh, I can't do a voice line for this.

1894
05:31:32,159 --> 05:31:52,729
These are the incomplete ones.

1895
05:31:52,729 --> 05:31:54,490
I'm curious about some of these.

1896
05:31:54,490 --> 05:31:58,110
Survive the battle at the villa

1897
05:31:58,110 --> 05:32:00,509
without blocking any of the windows with wooden planks.

1898
05:32:00,509 --> 05:32:01,150
Okay.

1899
05:32:01,150 --> 05:32:05,099
Make it through Ashley's section

1900
05:32:05,099 --> 05:32:06,860
without using the lantern.

1901
05:32:06,860 --> 05:32:09,200
It's probably kind of hard.

1902
05:32:09,200 --> 05:32:15,209
What are some of the high?

1903
05:32:15,209 --> 05:32:16,650
Okay, this one's expensive.

1904
05:32:16,650 --> 05:32:19,520
Destroy all clockwork.

1905
05:32:19,520 --> 05:32:24,000
Oh, you get the super knife

1906
05:32:24,000 --> 05:32:34,270
for getting all 16 of them.

1907
05:32:34,270 --> 05:32:35,520
Very cool.

1908
05:32:35,520 --> 05:32:37,439
I do want to do one quick thing.

1909
05:32:37,439 --> 05:32:47,630
I just want to see.

1910
05:32:52,360 --> 05:32:53,959
Whoa, wait, hold on.

1911
05:32:53,959 --> 05:32:54,680
Face guard?

1912
05:32:55,479 --> 05:33:03,069
Oh, I can put this doesn't work with that.

1913
05:33:03,630 --> 05:33:04,189
I want to see.

1914
05:33:16,560 --> 05:33:17,200
I just want to see.

1915
05:33:21,930 --> 05:33:24,650
No auto save pairing is limited to perfect parries

1916
05:33:24,650 --> 05:33:25,849
and all weapon modifications

1917
05:33:25,849 --> 05:33:27,529
will be available from the start.

1918
05:33:27,529 --> 05:33:35,880
I just want to see the outfit.

1919
05:33:35,880 --> 05:33:40,959
Yeah, this is the end of the stream, by the way.

1920
05:33:40,959 --> 05:33:43,000
Those of you waiting.

1921
05:33:51,770 --> 05:33:59,389
I just want to see the costume.

1922
05:34:01,450 --> 05:34:02,250
Fucking dickhead.

1923
05:34:11,000 --> 05:34:12,200
Agent 47.

1924
05:35:54,639 --> 05:35:55,139
That's it.

1925
05:35:57,180 --> 05:35:59,180
What was that?

1926
05:35:59,180 --> 05:36:01,180
That was it.

1927
05:36:01,180 --> 05:36:04,110
Turn the original music on and sound effects.

1928
05:36:04,110 --> 05:36:05,229
Oh, I could do that.

1929
05:36:05,229 --> 05:36:06,159
No, that's it.

1930
05:36:06,159 --> 05:36:06,959
I'll see you guys later.

1931
05:36:08,509 --> 05:36:10,110
Let's talk about what the plan is

1932
05:36:10,110 --> 05:36:13,900
this upcoming next little bit.

1933
05:36:13,900 --> 05:36:19,080
So I will see you all on Friday.

1934
05:36:19,639 --> 05:36:23,580
I'll see you Friday.

1935
05:36:23,580 --> 05:36:26,700
So it is midnight Thursday.

1936
05:36:27,259 --> 05:36:28,880
I will see you guys on Friday.

1937
05:36:29,439 --> 05:36:31,340
We're going to just chill out a little bit.

1938
05:36:32,139 --> 05:36:33,979
Play some Breath of the Wild.

1939
05:36:36,970 --> 05:36:39,369
Just going to be working through it.

1940
05:36:39,369 --> 05:36:43,069
That was awesome.

1941
05:36:43,069 --> 05:36:44,990
I'm sad that it's kind of over.

1942
05:36:44,990 --> 05:36:53,150
It's a kind of post-awesome game depression, right?

1943
05:36:53,150 --> 05:36:54,669
Whatever you want to call it.

1944
05:36:54,669 --> 05:36:56,700
Like, oh, that was really cool.

1945
05:36:56,700 --> 05:36:57,419
That was great.

1946
05:36:57,419 --> 05:36:59,979
That was worth waiting for.

1947
05:36:59,979 --> 05:37:01,740
What an amazing game.

1948
05:37:01,740 --> 05:37:03,900
What an amazing experience.

1949
05:37:03,900 --> 05:37:06,220
And now it's over.

1950
05:37:06,220 --> 05:37:08,220
But it's not because I can play through it again.

1951
05:37:08,220 --> 05:37:09,020
There's a lot I didn't do.

1952
05:37:11,770 --> 05:37:12,729
But that was really good.

1953
05:37:17,639 --> 05:37:19,720
Also, keep in mind, again,

1954
05:37:19,799 --> 05:37:22,919
Grotto Beasts is going to be shipping

1955
05:37:23,560 --> 05:37:25,369
for at least the first pass,

1956
05:37:25,369 --> 05:37:28,810
the first pass of the pre-sale orders.

1957
05:37:28,810 --> 05:37:31,580
So over the next week or two,

1958
05:37:31,580 --> 05:37:38,889
I would keep an eye on your mailbox.

1959
05:37:38,889 --> 05:37:44,319
So I think we're very imminent on shipping.

1960
05:37:44,319 --> 05:37:45,840
So that's really exciting.

1961
05:37:45,840 --> 05:37:49,819
Say again when the pre-sale ends.

1962
05:37:49,819 --> 05:37:52,299
So you could effectively operate

1963
05:37:52,299 --> 05:37:55,849
as if the pre-sale is over.

1964
05:37:55,849 --> 05:37:58,040
I would say as of now.

1965
05:37:58,040 --> 05:37:59,720
We are extending some stuff.

1966
05:38:01,930 --> 05:38:03,529
The posters and all that stuff

1967
05:38:03,529 --> 05:38:06,220
has been extended just by a little bit.

1968
05:38:09,020 --> 05:38:10,380
But you can operate as if,

1969
05:38:10,380 --> 05:38:12,139
I would say as if we're out of pre-sale.

1970
05:38:13,549 --> 05:38:15,150
I would say, yeah.

1971
05:38:15,869 --> 05:38:19,869
Now there is something that is going to happen

1972
05:38:19,869 --> 05:38:21,310
to be the official,

1973
05:38:22,360 --> 05:38:25,080
the official launch of the project.

1974
05:38:26,939 --> 05:38:28,139
You'll have to see what that is.

1975
05:38:28,700 --> 05:38:31,259
I'm not going to tell you anything else.

1976
05:38:31,259 --> 05:38:33,770
And it's fucking cool.

1977
05:38:34,650 --> 05:38:35,450
That's it.

1978
05:38:35,450 --> 05:38:45,740
I'm going to implode, yeah.

1979
05:38:46,380 --> 05:38:51,959
What time are you going to stream on Friday?

1980
05:38:51,959 --> 05:38:52,840
Probably around the same time.

1981
05:38:52,840 --> 05:38:54,200
Probably like 5, 6.

1982
05:38:54,200 --> 05:38:55,720
Just put 6 p.m. Pacific.

1983
05:38:55,720 --> 05:38:56,840
Easier that way.

1984
05:38:56,840 --> 05:38:58,040
It's going to be a really chill stream.

1985
05:39:00,319 --> 05:39:02,400
Cam's going off for another little while.

1986
05:39:02,400 --> 05:39:06,439
Going to relax, play some Breath of the Wild.

1987
05:39:06,439 --> 05:39:08,279
If you want to join us, please do.

1988
05:39:08,840 --> 05:39:11,259
Should be fun.

1989
05:39:11,259 --> 05:39:15,439
So that was Resident Evil 4.

1990
05:39:15,439 --> 05:39:17,520
And when the Mercenaries comes out,

1991
05:39:18,639 --> 05:39:20,080
I'm sure I'll play it.

1992
05:39:20,080 --> 05:39:26,270
For at least a couple of hours or something.

1993
05:39:26,270 --> 05:39:29,680
Very good.

1994
05:39:29,680 --> 05:39:30,639
Let me just quit out of this.

1995
05:39:31,439 --> 05:39:49,310
See you on Friday.

1996
05:39:49,310 --> 05:39:51,229
Are you ever going to play Sorcery ever again?

1997
05:39:52,860 --> 05:39:54,220
Let me get through Breath of the Wild

1998
05:39:54,220 --> 05:39:59,340
because I feel like the Breath of the Wild berries are...

1999
05:40:00,569 --> 05:40:02,090
They are starving.

2000
05:40:04,700 --> 05:40:07,500
So let's get through Breath of the Wild first.

2001
05:40:08,060 --> 05:40:13,869
What about House Flipper?

2002
05:40:15,069 --> 05:40:22,970
I don't know.

2003
05:40:22,970 --> 05:40:23,610
Probably not.

2004
05:40:24,169 --> 05:40:25,740
This is some new stuff.

2005
05:40:26,380 --> 05:40:34,319
Don't forget my birthday, please.

2006
05:40:34,319 --> 05:40:35,840
My Roblox birthday.

2007
05:40:36,479 --> 05:40:48,799
Would you ever do Stardew Valley again?

2008
05:40:48,799 --> 05:40:51,000
There's definitely a place for it

2009
05:40:51,000 --> 05:40:52,360
during one of these chiller streams.

2010
05:40:54,799 --> 05:40:55,520
Maybe one day.

2011
05:41:03,759 --> 05:41:05,290
But good night.

2012
05:41:05,290 --> 05:41:06,680
See you Friday.

2013
05:41:06,680 --> 05:41:08,520
Technically tomorrow for a lot of you.

2014
05:41:10,860 --> 05:41:11,659
Season.

2015
05:41:11,659 --> 05:41:14,939
Have a great rest of your night.

2016
05:41:14,939 --> 05:41:17,229
I'll see you on the weekend.

2017
05:41:17,229 --> 05:41:19,119
Or the start of the weekend.

2018
05:41:19,119 --> 05:41:21,560
Take it easy.

2019
05:41:21,560 --> 05:41:22,520
Call your mother.

2020
05:41:22,520 --> 05:41:23,790
Have a great day.

2021
05:41:24,349 --> 05:41:43,020
Goodbye.
