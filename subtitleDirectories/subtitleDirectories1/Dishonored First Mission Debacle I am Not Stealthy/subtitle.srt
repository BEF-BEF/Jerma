1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,820
Oh, I didn't see that guy. Oh, let's just take this guy out. Oh, this is gonna be funny. Watch this.

2
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:42,420
Bottom shop! Anybody in this room? Probably. Meeting chamber. All right, there's probably a bunch of

3
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:56,539
people in here. I guess not. Where's the bone? 19. It's right in here. There it is. Pick it up!

4
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:15,549
Dark matter. Oh, they're in there. Okay. So is it time to throw a grenade in that room?

5
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:21,659
Is that what we're doing? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

6
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:27,629
Do I have to poison these guys? Combine the two glasses. Poison. Oh my god, hold on. I don't know

7
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:35,859
what to do. All right, hold on. Let me look at this. So who am I supposed to even be killing? Campbell's

8
00:01:35,859 --> 00:01:43,780
glass. Kernel's glass. Eliminate Campbell. Poison one or both of the glasses. Wait for the Campbell

9
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:55,420
to enter. Okay. I'm gonna poison both of them. Poison. Poison both. Oh god! They're opening the

10
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:24,000
door. Where is he? Oh, here we go. This is where we poison. Wait, I wasn't supposed to do that?

11
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:34,639
Oh crap, that's the guy I was supposed to save. Hold on a minute. Hold on. Hey guys, don't drink

12
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,639
those yet. I want to just... Before you drink those, I have something to say. One of them is

13
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:48,020
poisoned. Please don't drink it and be... Okay. Yeah, thanks guys. See ya. Yeah, don't drink that

14
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:59,009
poison yet. All right, this time I'm not going to poison her uncle because I was not supposed

15
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:13,919
to do that. Poison Campbell. Let's go. Oh man, I so badly want to throw a grenade in the room.

16
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:29,180
So badly. Oh, I so... What? Oh no. This wasn't supposed to happen like this. This wasn't supposed

17
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:41,039
to happen. This wasn't supposed to happen. They're like fighting in the other room. Hold on. Am I

18
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:58,879
actually going to get away with this? This guy is fighting in this room. He's dead right in the

19
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:13,900
corner. I can't believe it. There was like gunfire out here. Oh man.

20
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:23,100
Man, that was hard laughing right there.

21
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,839
I can't believe that happened.
