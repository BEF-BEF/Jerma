00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:18,960
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with Infectinator, the reimagining and the remaking of an old Flash game by the same title.

2
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:29,460
This is actually, people like to say this is Infectinator 2. I don't really see it as that. I see this as, again, a reimagining of the original Flash game or of the World Domination title,

3
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:36,460
because that's essentially what you're going to be doing in this game. And this is one of my all-time favorite Flash games ever, and it's been ported to mobile devices.

4
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:43,460
So that's why I say reimagining, because it was never on mobile devices before until this point. So what is this game? What's going to happen here?

5
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:51,460
And this is, I guess, the revival of a series I used to do called Little Gems, and it's when I review a mobile game on Android, iPhone, iPad, anything like that.

6
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,460
So we're not going to waste any more time. I'm going to go right into this here, talk about Infectinator.

7
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:03,409
So at the heart of this game, it is a World Domination simulator, not like the ones you're used to. This is not, you know,

8
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:12,409
or take your army general and go from country to country. No, no, no. Instead of being an army general, you are a hive mind virus

9
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:18,409
that your entire goal is to spread around the entire world, destroying every single continent on Earth.

10
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:27,409
Now that might sound a little bit morbid, and it kind of is. This game is a little bit graphic in the sense that the whole point of the game is to destroy all of humanity

11
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:33,030
and not to rescue or save anything. So the gameplay mechanics are actually very, very simple.

12
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:42,030
It's all about clicking on people to infect them with a virus, and you want to try and spread the virus around until everybody on the screen is dead.

13
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:49,030
Again, we're going back to morbid thoughts here, but you use your hand. You tap your finger down on anywhere on the screen.

14
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:53,030
Anywhere in that area, people are going to turn into zombies. You're going to kill them. They'll turn into zombies.

15
00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:00,030
Walk around for a certain period of time, depending on your upgrades. And we all know how much I am adoring of an upgrade system in a game.

16
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:06,030
There's a really, really good one in this one. But anyways, you click on the screen, you get people infected, and you try to complete objectives.

17
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:12,210
Each level in this game has four objectives. Completing all of them will destroy that city.

18
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:19,210
And again, the whole point of this game is to infect and destroy the entire world, so it's in your best interest to complete all four of those objectives.

19
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:24,210
They can be things from completing the level in a certain amount of time to summoning a certain zombie.

20
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:29,210
We'll get to that in a minute. Or anything as simple as blowing somebody up with a grenade or something.

21
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:32,210
There's objectives in each level, and they change for each level.

22
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:37,090
So now we get the basics down. Let's talk about the best part about this entire game.

23
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:42,090
And like I said, I'm an upgrade fiend. You guys all know that if you are old subscribers to this channel.

24
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,090
So how this one works, you get money, as you've probably seen on the screen.

25
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,090
Money drops out of people when they become infected and when they die.

26
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:53,090
And how you collect it, you just kind of scroll your mouse over the money and you'll pick it up.

27
00:02:53,090 --> 00:03:01,330
What you do with that money is then you spend it on upgrades for your zombies or to buy and upgrade special zombies.

28
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,330
I actually think I just said mouse right there. We're talking about the mobile version of the game.

29
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,330
So your finger, you swipe your finger across the money to pick it up.

30
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:13,330
This game is for PC, it is for computer, but we're talking about the mobile version right now.

31
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:20,330
So anyways, how you spend this money after you collect it is you go to the lab, which is just a glorified huge upgrade screen.

32
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:25,330
And almost every single aspect of your zombies can be improved with that money.

33
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:33,330
So we're talking their attack damage, how fast they move, their lifespan, how much infection chance percentage they get when they bite somebody and kill somebody.

34
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:38,330
So there's a ton here, and it takes a lot of money to do a lot of these things.

35
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:44,330
Especially if you played through the whole game more than once, you're going to need to spend a lot of that money on these upgrades.

36
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:48,330
Because they incrementally, exponentially get higher after each upgrade.

37
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,330
So just keep that in mind while you're playing through the game.

38
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:55,759
And also one of the most important parts of this game are the special zombies that you get.

39
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:59,759
You unlock them by doing certain achievements or by completing certain continents.

40
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:04,759
There's a long list of them, and some of them you can't even get unless you beat the game once or twice.

41
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,759
So it takes a long time to do a completionist kind of aspect of this game.

42
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:12,759
But anyway, so you get these four slots.

43
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:19,759
There's also four slots for support, too, where your grenades are, your green goo that infects people and lets them stay in one place.

44
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,759
And they all can be upgraded.

45
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:29,759
Well, the support can't be upgraded, but all these special zombies that have their own traits and their own damage numbers, they can all be upgraded three times.

46
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,759
And I don't think I've even said this yet, and the video is probably going to be wrapping up here.

47
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,759
This game's free. It is completely free on every single device.

48
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,759
And again, it's free on PC as well.

49
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,759
The only thing that they charge for, there are in-app purchases for the gold.

50
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:49,759
So if you are, you know, you don't want to spend like five million years grinding gold to try and get to the next level or something,

51
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,759
you can buy a package of gold for a certain amount of money.

52
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,759
But the whole experience is completely free.

53
00:04:54,759 --> 00:05:00,189
You don't have to spend one cent on anything to download it and play it and get the most out of it.

54
00:05:00,189 --> 00:05:07,189
And just for a point of reference here, I've beaten this game multiple times and I didn't need to spend one dollar in the in-app purchase store.

55
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:11,189
So it's not one of those games where you're required to buy the gold.

56
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:12,189
You don't have to do that.

57
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:14,819
But that is going to wrap up the video, guys.

58
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:16,819
Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

59
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:19,819
Go get Infectinator right now. It is awesome.

60
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:25,819
I highly recommend it. All the links are in the description for your various devices or if you want to play it on PC.

61
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:27,819
So thank you guys again so much for watching.

62
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:28,819
I'll see you all next time.

63
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:30,819
