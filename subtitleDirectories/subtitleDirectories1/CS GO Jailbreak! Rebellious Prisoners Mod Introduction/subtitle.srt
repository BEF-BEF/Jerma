00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,890
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with some Counter-Strike Global Offensive.

2
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,890
Now, this game is released. It is out. I want to say that very first and foremost.

3
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:24,890
I haven't done a video on CSGO in quite a while, and that's because I was really waiting for this mode to come out.

4
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:29,890
I was waiting for it to come out to retail so I could buy it and play on this map whenever I felt like...

5
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:35,130
Oh, no, sorry, this mode, whenever I felt like it. And this mode is Jailbreak.

6
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:41,130
If you do not know what Jailbreak is, I'm going to give you a very brief synopsis before we cut into some of these goofy moments here.

7
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:47,130
And I have a video coming out in a couple of days that is pretty hysterical. It's me as the warden.

8
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,130
But we will get into that later in a couple of days, but I'm going to give you the basics of this mode.

9
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:57,130
I'm going to talk about a little bit why I love it so much, and then we'll get into some goofiness that happened during these playthroughs.

10
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:04,430
So what is Jailbreak? What exactly is going on? What is this game mode all about? And why is it so much fun?

11
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:11,670
First and foremost, Jailbreak is a game mode that pits two sides against each other, but not in the typical sense.

12
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:17,670
You have the prison guards who are there to construct order and to make sure nothing crazy happens.

13
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,670
And then you have the prisoners. And then you have the warden.

14
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:27,670
So pretty much there's three different things going on here. You have one guy who is the warden giving orders to all the prisoners.

15
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:35,670
Now, as a prisoner, you can either take these orders and follow the rules and follow the guidelines and survive till the end of the round, maybe.

16
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,670
Maybe make a couple of friends while you're at it.

17
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:42,670
But if you do not want to listen to the orders the warden gives you, you do not have to.

18
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:48,670
And that's why it's such a crazy social experiment, because you can start uprisings. You can just attack somebody.

19
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,670
You're probably going to die, but it's still fun to see reactions regardless.

20
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:59,170
So if you are playing as a prisoner, if you are on the side with the majority of people, that's where the most people are going to be.

21
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:06,340
Most people are going to be a prisoner. You start with only a knife and you start in a jail cell.

22
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,710
Some of these cells are going to have weapons in them.

23
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:14,710
Very, very minor weapons, something like a pistol or a grenade or something like that.

24
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,710
And the warden and the prison guards are going to be looking out for that.

25
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:24,710
So you really need to be cautious if you're going to plan on using these items that happen to be spawned in your particular jail cell.

26
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:28,949
So right at the beginning of a round, every single round, this is how every single round plays out,

27
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:33,949
they're either going to give you a free day or they are going to give you specific instructions.

28
00:02:33,949 --> 00:02:38,949
Now what a free day is, a free day is they just open the doors and you can do whatever you want.

29
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:41,949
If you happen to attack one of the prison guards, you're going to die.

30
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:45,949
But you don't have to follow any specific instructions during a free day, in quotes.

31
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:51,449
So you're probably asking yourself, Jerma, how the hell is order even kept here?

32
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:56,449
Why don't the prison guards just open fire on everybody and why aren't there trolls everywhere?

33
00:02:56,449 --> 00:03:03,449
Now they do exist, but you have to remember these admins are very, very strict about who they allow to play these games.

34
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:09,449
So if you jump into one of these games as a prison guard and you just start unloading on the prisoners for no reason at all,

35
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:14,449
you are going to get permabanned from this server. You're going to get kicked. If you do it again, you're going to get banned.

36
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:18,449
They're very, very proactive about that. So nobody really does it.

37
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:22,819
Usually everybody plays along and tries to fit in their specific role.

38
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:26,819
I, for one, when I play these games, I have such trouble playing as a prisoner.

39
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:32,819
I always try to find a way to sneak away or try to get a gun and shoot one of the prison guards.

40
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:38,819
It's so much fun trying to find different things to do because there's all kinds of little hidden areas you can find your way into.

41
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:43,819
It's so much fun, guys, and I highly recommend you jump into a jailbreak server.

42
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:48,819
Whether if you're going to try and play as the warden and give instructions and keep order or play as a prisoner

43
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:54,819
and either follow the directions and play till the end and try and last till the very end or try to start an uprising.

44
00:03:54,819 --> 00:04:00,819
It's just a great experiment, guys, and please, please, please go find some servers that play jailbreak.

45
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:04,819
There's only about a handful of them, though, so you got to really look for them.

46
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:11,500
So that is going to wrap up my post commentary here. I'm going to cut to a couple of funny moments in the next couple of minutes.

47
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:18,500
So sit back, relax and enjoy the jailbreak, guys, and look forward in the next couple of days to Jerma the warden.

48
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:24,089
And I'll leave it at that. And of course, take care, everybody.

49
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:29,420
What did he say? What did you say?

50
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:36,740
Another free day. Free day. He said come within five feet and we get shot.

51
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:41,740
There's a sniper rifle just sitting right here. I want that sniper rifle.

52
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,740
Oh, Tio, Tio, Tio got it.

53
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,360
Jerma, do it.

54
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,360
No, dude, there's four of them just sitting here pointing at me. I'll never get out in time.

55
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,360
As soon as he does, hell will break loose.

56
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,360
Spoon, are you still alive?

57
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,360
No, I said I'm free and ran away and died.

58
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,360
I'm just waiting for an opportunity to try and grab that and run out of the room.

59
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,360
I'm just staring.

60
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,360
Oh, he just made it easier.

61
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,360
I got it. I got it.

62
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:26,110
CT's on the top floor. I want you to walk towards the end, walk down the stairs and join your buddies.

63
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,110
Walk down the stairs. Are these the stairs?

64
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,110
Why are you shooting me?

65
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,980
No free killing, guys.

66
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,980
Oh, I got an opportunity to knife this guy right in the back.

67
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,980
Oh, no, I've been doing way too much of that.

68
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,470
Face the wall.

69
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,470
Are we playing Red Rover?

70
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,079
We sure are.

71
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:51,079
Someone go up there and check to make sure there's no one left up there.

72
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:54,379
This is so scary.

73
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:57,379
I'm getting so fucking stupid.

74
00:05:57,379 --> 00:05:59,379
Oh shit, what is this?

75
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:01,379
First reaction, last reaction.

76
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:03,379
I forget how this works.

77
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:08,709
I think it's the first person to do something.

78
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:11,889
I hope you guys know the rules, CT's.

79
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:15,709
Explain the rules, please.

80
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,709
First reaction, the first person to do something gets killed.

81
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:21,709
If I call last reaction, the last person to do it gets killed.

82
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:23,709
Okay, thank you.

83
00:06:46,269 --> 00:06:48,269
What is going on?

84
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:50,269
Where's the gun? Where's the gun?

85
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,959
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

86
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:57,519
All right, all right, guys.

87
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,519
We're going to start playing now.

88
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:03,519
Fuck everybody!

89
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:08,519
Dude, there's only like three people alive.

90
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:12,519
What?

91
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,980
I got given a grenade. Should I throw it away?

92
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,470
Throw it in yourself, please.

93
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,470
Don't kill him, don't kill him.

94
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,470
Don't kill him, don't kill him.

95
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,649
Don't kill him.

96
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:29,649
I did it.

97
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,649
Oh, what the hell?

98
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:33,649
What the fuck did you kill him for?

99
00:07:33,649 --> 00:07:35,649
He killed me.

100
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:37,649
Son of a bitch.

101
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:39,649
Don't pick up his gun.

102
00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:41,649
Dude, he's giving me the gun.

103
00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:43,649
He just gave me the gun.

104
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:45,649
Go drop it, go drop it.

105
00:07:45,649 --> 00:07:47,649
Did he steal the gun away?

106
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:49,649
What are you...

107
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:52,779
I don't know.

108
00:07:57,339 --> 00:07:59,339
Dude, the guy walked over and threw the gun at me.

109
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:01,339
He was like planting it on me.

110
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:03,579
Did I have a grenade or something?
