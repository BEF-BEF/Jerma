00:07:46,870 --> 00:24:14,059
Hello! Hi, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Germa 985 Holiday Christmas Special.

2
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:19,059
And the award show. I'm Germa, how are you? How's everybody doing?

3
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:25,059
Ooh, sorry, it's a little chilly. Oh, it's snowing out there.

4
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:28,299
I have a few things to talk about before we get started.

5
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:33,230
Thank you for joining me on this beautiful holiday afternoon.

6
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:37,230
Over here is a schedule. Everything you need to see today is right here.

7
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:45,230
Awards are happening, by the way. Medius categories ever. 27 categories this year.

8
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:48,230
There's a lot. I hope you're ready.

9
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:53,230
Oh, not only that, we've got also the elf puzzle room. What is the elf puzzle room? Who knows?

10
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,230
You'll find out very soon.

11
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:58,410
Do I see holiday cheer in the chat yet, please?

12
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:01,710
There is a schedule, of course there is.

13
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:04,710
Can I see some people Christmas, please?

14
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:09,079
I need to see it. I'm not going to go any further.

15
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:17,150
Okay, so also, Bugleberry is in the building. Can we get some applause for Bugleberry?

16
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:20,779
Yes. Thank you, thank you.

17
00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:23,779
Going to be making a nice, delicious holiday turkey.

18
00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:26,779
From what I've been told, I don't know. We'll see what he comes up with.

19
00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:29,779
But also, what's under the tree here?

20
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:34,079
I'm going to be opening a lot of these presents. Remember we did that a few years ago?

21
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:36,079
They're under here now.

22
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:38,319
It's going to be so nice. It's going to be...

23
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:42,319
Wait, what's in this one? Hold on.

24
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:44,319
I didn't peek, I promise.

25
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:46,319
Oh, I think that might be an Xbox.

26
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:50,319
It could be an Xbox. I don't know. We'll see, we'll see.

27
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:55,319
But anyways, before we get started, how do you do a holiday show?

28
00:25:55,319 --> 00:26:01,319
Without, of course, an intro. Without a musical intro, perhaps.

29
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:06,319
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome, round of applause, Top Shelf Vocal.

30
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:13,039
Yeah, absolutely. Thank you so much for coming.

31
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,039
Really appreciate everybody here.

32
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:21,039
And from hearing you practice earlier, sounds like you're going to do a little bit of jingle bells, from what I understand.

33
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,039
Yes, sir.

34
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:28,029
And I'll also be joining you as well, as a choir together.

35
00:26:28,029 --> 00:26:29,029
Are you guys ready?

36
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:30,029
Okay.

37
00:26:30,029 --> 00:26:31,029
Is that okay?

38
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:32,029
Of course it is.

39
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:39,920
Hey, before we start, Merry Christmas, Happy New Year. Let's get started.

40
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:47,740
Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh.

41
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:51,740
All the wheels we go, laughing all the way.

42
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,740
Ha!

43
00:26:52,740 --> 00:34:57,530
Bells on bobtail.

44
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:01,409
Just refresh the screen, then. I don't understand.

45
00:35:01,409 --> 00:35:05,420
What the fuck are you talking about?

46
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:09,420
I mean, just refresh. Is the internet problem? We lost the internet. Is that what happened?

47
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:12,739
So just get it back.

48
00:35:12,739 --> 00:35:15,980
Can you connect to another Twitch server?

49
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:22,340
There's a guy on the channel right now.

50
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:26,929
What do you mean there's a guy on the channel right now? What guy?

51
00:35:26,929 --> 00:35:28,929
What the fuck are you talking about?

52
00:35:28,929 --> 00:35:31,929
Production in my ear right now. Tell me what's happening. Because I don't understand.

53
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:33,929
The stream got hacked?

54
00:35:33,929 --> 00:35:35,929
My stream got hacked?

55
00:35:35,929 --> 00:35:45,380
What?

56
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:51,030
Should we do a different channel or what? What the fuck is going on?

57
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:58,969
Shut the fuck up!

58
00:35:58,969 --> 00:36:01,969
Don't talk to me. Don't make eye contact with me.

59
00:36:01,969 --> 00:36:08,690
You know what? Hold on. Show me what's going on.

60
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:10,690
What's happening in here?

61
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,690
Remember, there's a data breach right here.

62
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:16,119
Well, someone accessed our stream key.

63
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:19,300
How expensive were you two, right?

64
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,300
I see his name here. This is my channel right here.

65
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,300
That's right.

66
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,300
And what happened?

67
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,300
It looks like there was a breach in the firewall.

68
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,300
Oh, it looks like there was a breach in the firewall.

69
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,300
What's your hourly rate, by the way?

70
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,300
Yeah, don't want to say that, by the way.

71
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,300
So you both have masters in technology. You can't fucking figure this out?

72
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,300
Rewrite the source code. Go for it.

73
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,300
Prescribe that source code over here. What he said.

74
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:47,980
Do you understand how much money this cost? Do you understand how much time I spent doing this?

75
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,980
Yes, sir.

76
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,349
Where's Offbrand?

77
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:55,349
Where the fuck is Ludwig? Where's Atrioc? Where the fuck are they?

78
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:57,909
A copy for Mr. Albertson.

79
00:36:57,909 --> 00:36:59,909
Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.

80
00:36:59,909 --> 00:37:02,909
Hey, buddy. How are you? Fucking snake, motherfucker.

81
00:37:02,909 --> 00:37:04,909
Who leaked my stream key?

82
00:37:04,909 --> 00:37:06,909
I don't know. What's going on? What's going on?

83
00:37:06,909 --> 00:37:08,909
Somebody is live on my channel right now.

84
00:37:08,909 --> 00:37:12,909
And I'm sorry, but it's making me very upset. And you need to figure out how it happened.

85
00:37:12,909 --> 00:37:14,909
We'll figure it out. Germo, we'll figure it out.

86
00:37:14,909 --> 00:37:18,909
If this is a problem, by the way, we are done.

87
00:37:18,909 --> 00:37:23,980
You and I are never talking ever again. By the way, this was made wrong.

88
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,980
Germo, dude.

89
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,980
Don, I don't want to talk to you. Go clean that up.

90
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:39,530
Shut up.

91
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:43,530
Hey, okay. So what the fuck the heck is going on here?

92
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:47,530
Hey, so are we live? Are we live on a different channel?

93
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,769
Okay. All right.

94
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:53,769
So what's happening here is this is the Elf Puzzle Room, by the way.

95
00:37:53,769 --> 00:37:55,769
Elf Puzzle Room.

96
00:37:55,769 --> 00:38:01,630
I don't know if we're even live yet. I don't know if we've even started yet.

97
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,630
But if we can get the energy in the room, we can get higher.

98
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:07,630
Yay. So we have a puzzle here that people are going to be doing in this room.

99
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,630
And it's going to be...

100
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:15,070
Stand up.

101
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:18,380
Get out. Get out.

102
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:21,639
I'm sorry. I don't want to be a dick about this.

103
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:25,639
But you were told in the contract when you signed it to shut the fuck up when I came in the room.

104
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:26,639
And that's fine.

105
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:29,639
So we've got this 10,000-piece puzzle.

106
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:30,639
We are actually live. Good.

107
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:34,639
So we've got this 10,000-piece puzzle, and it's going to be done over the course of the evening.

108
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:36,639
This is awesome. Hooray.

109
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:40,639
So you can get started here with this, and you can go for it.

110
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:44,639
And hey, don't you think we should have a little bit of snow?

111
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:45,639
Yeah.

112
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:48,929
Yeah. Yeah.

113
00:38:48,929 --> 00:38:50,929
All right. So let's get it started here.

114
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:53,929
Hey, snow! Snow! Snow! Snow! Snow! Snow! Snow!

115
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,800
Ow.

116
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,800
What the fuck did I have, Dad?

117
00:39:08,800 --> 00:43:11,820
So we confirmed that the other channel, my channel is not working.

118
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:15,150
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

119
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:25,260
I'm sorry, everybody, that this is happening.

120
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:31,590
I just want to say that it's, you know, you've got to do what you've got to do.

121
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:33,590
And we're doing this now.

122
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:36,590
And it's time for us to just...

123
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:40,590
Can somebody please get rid of the ASCII art in the chat that I see over here?

124
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:46,750
All I see is ASCII art. I just saw Forsen like a thousand times.

125
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,929
What do you mean, like, come on, Forsen.

126
00:43:48,929 --> 00:43:52,170
But there's a lot. We need to clean that up a little, I think.

127
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:56,170
While we're here, we're live, we're good, hi, how are you?

128
00:43:56,170 --> 00:44:00,170
Can we potentially get some people to, say, clap maybe in the back?

129
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:03,170
Maybe just pretend like we're doing something good?

130
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:08,670
Stop spamming the ASCII art!

131
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:14,690
I've got an award show to do.

132
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:20,699
Regardless of where we are, regardless of whose channel we're on,

133
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:23,699
there, we have awards to do, and we have a lot of them.

134
00:44:23,699 --> 00:44:25,699
So we have to get started.

135
00:44:25,699 --> 00:44:28,190
I don't know what's going on over on the other channel.

136
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:30,190
I don't know what happened, but we're working on it.

137
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:32,190
We've got engineers that are incredibly skilled.

138
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:35,190
But we're going to have to do the awards over here.

139
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:40,010
So, we'll start. I've got to compose myself a little.

140
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:42,010
I've got cocoa over here.

141
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:46,010
And it was so freshly brewed and everything just got ruined.

142
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:49,010
It's okay. Is it all right?

143
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:52,010
Well, what is he even doing on the other channel while we just do this?

144
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:58,980
What's he doing on the other channel?

145
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,980
What is he playing? Is he playing a game?

146
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:04,250
Dude, you got no mods.

147
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:06,250
Do you think I thought of that?

148
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:08,250
Do you think that I thought of that?

149
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:11,250
Before the channel got compromised and we're on a different channel.

150
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,250
Do you think I thought of that? Are you stupid?

151
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:19,579
Don't get mad at people in chat. There's no reason to.

152
00:45:19,579 --> 00:45:23,579
I'm going to do my awards show the way that I'm supposed to.

153
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:25,579
27 categories.

154
00:45:25,579 --> 00:45:27,940
And we're going to get started here.

155
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:29,940
So, let's just relax. Can we reset?

156
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,940
Let's reset.

157
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:37,079
The first category is best bro.

158
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:39,079
And what is best bro?

159
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:43,079
Best bro is when I said, I don't know why this is even a category,

160
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:47,079
but it's when I said bro a handful of times.

161
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:50,079
So it should be fun to see what those nominees are.

162
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:53,079
Here are your nominees for best bro of the year.

163
00:45:53,079 --> 00:46:02,659
There's one place I didn't go.

164
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:04,659
I need to go to the magic school.

165
00:46:04,659 --> 00:46:07,159
Where's the magic school?

166
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:11,860
Bro, where's the magic school?

167
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:12,860
No more of this.

168
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:16,860
Bro, this is the thing you attached a trailer to a truck.

169
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:20,349
That's not a woodcutter.

170
00:46:20,349 --> 00:46:22,349
What do you mean look at it?

171
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:25,679
I'm not looking at it.

172
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:31,920
Bro, fellas, ladies and gentlemen, that is not a woodcutter.

173
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,920
I'm pressing the buttons.

174
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,670
What the fuck?

175
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:38,670
I'm pressing down.

176
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:41,670
It just fucking hits a wall and freezes, bro.

177
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:44,940
Bro, relax.

178
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,940
Bro, where am I supposed to put this?

179
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,940
Why is this even a category by the way?

180
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:51,239
Bro.

181
00:46:51,239 --> 00:46:53,739
This is at the last second.

182
00:46:53,739 --> 00:46:57,829
What a stupid category.

183
00:46:57,829 --> 00:46:59,829
Give me a break, man.

184
00:46:59,829 --> 00:47:00,829
Are you kidding me?

185
00:47:00,829 --> 00:47:02,829
Melaton is a rhythm game that requires precise timing.

186
00:47:02,829 --> 00:47:04,829
For a dreamy experience, make sure your sound is on

187
00:47:04,829 --> 00:47:09,099
and avoid using Bluetooth audio.

188
00:47:09,099 --> 00:47:10,659
Bro.

189
00:47:10,659 --> 00:47:13,940
Bro.

190
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:20,110
Bro.

191
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:22,110
Bro?

192
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:24,110
Honestly, man, when somebody asks you,

193
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:28,110
when somebody says, hey, dude, do you know there's a dodge in the game?

194
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:30,110
Bro.

195
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:32,480
Yes.

196
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:38,940
Oh.

197
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,940
You, bro.

198
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:45,099
What the fuck?

199
00:47:45,099 --> 00:47:46,599
Oh.

200
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:50,760
Okay, bro.

201
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,760
What are you fucking doing?

202
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:56,090
What the fuck are you talking about, bro?

203
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:58,090
I was hitting X on the right spot.

204
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:00,090
This is making me really mad.

205
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:04,090
Bro, House Flipper is my number one most played game on stream.

206
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:06,090
You don't think I know what I'm supposed...

207
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:08,090
I'm just trying to do the missions quickly

208
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:10,090
to be able to buy the house.

209
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:12,090
Bro.

210
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:14,900
Bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, slow down.

211
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:18,360
I just need to hit you with this.

212
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:24,699
I got it.

213
00:48:24,699 --> 00:48:26,699
Somebody in the chat said,

214
00:48:26,699 --> 00:48:28,699
I just saw it, somebody in the chat said,

215
00:48:28,699 --> 00:48:31,699
hey, bro, can you play Call of Duty, bro?

216
00:48:31,699 --> 00:48:34,460
Right now, are you going to say that?

217
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:37,400
Right now?

218
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:43,400
Anyways, your winner for best bro of the year is...

219
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:49,929
Let me get into it.

220
00:48:49,929 --> 00:48:51,929
I don't even know which one this is.

221
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:56,809
Bro, are you kidding me with 26% of the vote?

222
00:48:56,809 --> 00:49:01,809
And did you know there's a dodge in this game for 24%?

223
00:49:01,809 --> 00:49:04,369
And then bro, it's not a woodcutter with 13.

224
00:49:04,369 --> 00:49:06,369
So bro, are you kidding me?

225
00:49:06,369 --> 00:49:08,369
I don't even know which one that is.

226
00:49:08,369 --> 00:49:11,699
But there you go, best bro.

227
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:13,699
We're going to do another one.

228
00:49:13,699 --> 00:49:15,699
This is worst beater,

229
00:49:15,699 --> 00:49:19,699
which also was actually supposed to be taken off the list.

230
00:49:19,699 --> 00:49:22,699
But I left it on accidentally

231
00:49:22,699 --> 00:49:24,699
and realized that it was still part of the categories

232
00:49:24,699 --> 00:49:26,699
before we removed it.

233
00:49:26,699 --> 00:49:29,639
So we're going to keep it in.

234
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:41,579
So let's go ahead and see the nominees for worst beater.

235
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:43,579
Over here, here, here.

236
00:49:43,579 --> 00:49:49,539
Over here, here, here.

237
00:49:49,539 --> 00:49:53,500
He's doing a joke.

238
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:56,510
Beater, beater.

239
00:49:56,510 --> 00:49:58,510
Beater.

240
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:01,260
I love it.

241
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:03,889
It was the chap.

242
00:50:03,889 --> 00:50:05,889
It was the chap took beater.

243
00:50:05,889 --> 00:50:07,889
We need a wow factor here.

244
00:50:07,889 --> 00:50:09,889
Okay.

245
00:50:09,889 --> 00:50:12,510
I'm going to bring it.

246
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:14,510
I wanted myself to be a dancer.

247
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:16,510
A dancer?

248
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:18,510
A dancer, something of a dancer myself.

249
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:21,900
That's a beater?

250
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,900
That is a beater.

251
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,900
Rats, rats.

252
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:28,340
We're the rats.

253
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:32,420
Peter.

254
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,420
It's your birthday today.

255
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:37,360
Cake and ice cream is on its way.

256
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,860
Peter.

257
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:44,219
You've been such a good boy this year.

258
00:50:44,219 --> 00:50:46,219
Stop saying Peter

259
00:50:46,219 --> 00:50:48,219
and help me with this fucking video game.

260
00:50:48,219 --> 00:50:50,219
Stop.

261
00:50:50,219 --> 00:50:52,219
It's half of the chat.

262
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:54,219
All I see is butt cracking beater.

263
00:50:54,219 --> 00:50:56,219
Help me.

264
00:50:56,219 --> 00:51:00,190
What did he say?

265
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:02,190
Wait, what did you say, Peter?

266
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:08,190
Peter?

267
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:12,159
I'm sorry, that's all I heard.

268
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:14,159
Hey, Peter.

269
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:16,159
There, old paly.

270
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:18,159
It's time for an old fashioned handshake.

271
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:21,280
The last supper.

272
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,280
Yeah, remember when Jesus

273
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,280
gave a hot tamale to Peter

274
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,780
and he didn't like it.

275
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:29,780
He almost puked.

276
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:31,780
Hello again, Peter.

277
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:33,780
It's me.

278
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:36,590
So.

279
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:39,469
I knew we were friends for a reason, Cricket.

280
00:51:39,469 --> 00:51:41,469
Yeah.

281
00:51:41,469 --> 00:51:43,469
We do joe.

282
00:51:43,469 --> 00:51:45,469
We do gourmet.

283
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:47,469
We can do just about everything.

284
00:51:47,469 --> 00:51:49,469
Where the hell is the medicate?

285
00:51:49,469 --> 00:51:51,469
Are you reading?

286
00:51:51,469 --> 00:51:53,469
Any amount of voices you can do?

287
00:51:53,469 --> 00:51:55,469
Worst category of the entire,

288
00:51:55,469 --> 00:52:02,449
the worst of the entire night.

289
00:52:02,449 --> 00:52:04,449
I don't know.

290
00:52:04,449 --> 00:52:06,449
People had to really search for that one.

291
00:52:06,449 --> 00:52:08,449
There's no way you even knew.

292
00:52:08,449 --> 00:52:10,449
Maybe some of you saved those clips from earlier.

293
00:52:10,449 --> 00:52:12,449
But ladies and gentlemen,

294
00:52:12,449 --> 00:52:14,449
your winner

295
00:52:14,449 --> 00:52:16,449
for worst beer of the year

296
00:52:16,449 --> 00:52:18,449
is, I actually don't know this,

297
00:52:18,449 --> 00:52:20,449
so this is going to be news to me too.

298
00:52:20,449 --> 00:52:23,579
You've been such a good boy, Peter.

299
00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:25,579
And then ghost Peter.

300
00:52:25,579 --> 00:52:27,889
And then infomercial Peter.

301
00:52:27,889 --> 00:52:29,889
And then infomercial Peter.

302
00:52:29,889 --> 00:52:31,889
By the way, you've been such a good boy, Peter,

303
00:52:31,889 --> 00:52:33,889
with 24.7% of the vote.

304
00:52:33,889 --> 00:52:35,889
So that's cool.

305
00:52:35,889 --> 00:52:37,889
Very interesting stuff.

306
00:52:37,889 --> 00:52:39,889
Moving right along.

307
00:52:39,889 --> 00:52:42,699
Look at this one.

308
00:52:42,699 --> 00:52:44,699
We're getting through the real shit

309
00:52:44,699 --> 00:52:46,699
categories first.

310
00:52:46,699 --> 00:52:48,699
Let me be really clear with you.

311
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:50,699
So we're going through the shit categories first.

312
00:52:50,699 --> 00:52:52,699
As the engineers are still working on the channel.

313
00:52:52,699 --> 00:52:55,329
Best ooo

314
00:52:55,329 --> 00:52:57,329
and I'll give one to you right now.

315
00:52:57,329 --> 00:52:59,760
So here it is.

316
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,760
I apparently do that quite often.

317
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,760
I don't know how often because

318
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,760
why am I opening it now? We haven't even seen the nominees.

319
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,699
Why would I do that without you seeing

320
00:53:10,699 --> 00:53:13,329
the nominees first?

321
00:53:13,329 --> 00:53:15,329
Anyways, here are your nominees for

322
00:53:15,329 --> 00:53:17,329
worst, no, it's best ooo

323
00:53:17,329 --> 00:53:19,329
of the year.

324
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:28,909
That was a good one too.

325
00:53:28,909 --> 00:53:34,400
Oh,

326
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,900
oh,

327
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:40,030
hmm.

328
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:42,590
Is that a mask?

329
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:45,280
Or does he actually have two heads?

330
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,280
Oh, oh, oh, oh,

331
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,280
oh, oh, oh, oh,

332
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,280
oh, oh, oh, we got it.

333
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,280
All right. Hello.

334
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,710
I'm here. I'm here

335
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:57,710
to get a rust repair kit.

336
00:53:57,710 --> 00:54:00,849
Oh, oh,

337
00:54:00,849 --> 00:54:07,940
oh, oh,

338
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:11,139
oh, oh,

339
00:54:11,139 --> 00:54:15,679
oh,

340
00:54:15,679 --> 00:54:18,880
oh,

341
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,880
can I stand actually for a spell

342
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,880
because if it is, I want to know what it is.

343
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,659
Mud, oh,

344
00:54:26,659 --> 00:54:28,659
oh,

345
00:54:28,659 --> 00:54:30,659
I like this game. This is a fun game.

346
00:54:30,659 --> 00:54:37,760
Oh,

347
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,760
oh,

348
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,320
oh, I didn't even need to, whatever.

349
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,880
Oh,

350
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:49,039
oh, get ready to nominate

351
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:57,039
that one. So all bad.

352
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:01,139
You know, before I

353
00:55:01,139 --> 00:55:03,440
open this, I want to say I didn't

354
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,440
think that there was even enough to

355
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,440
vote for this year. I think I said

356
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,440
that a few weeks ago.

357
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,440
I was like, there's no way that I did this

358
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,440
this many times, but apparently I did

359
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,869
it a thousand times.

360
00:55:15,869 --> 00:55:17,869
We'll see who wins. Ladies and gentlemen, your winner

361
00:55:17,869 --> 00:55:19,869
for worst ooh ooh ooh

362
00:55:19,869 --> 00:55:21,869
of the year is

363
00:55:21,869 --> 00:55:25,329
with

364
00:55:25,329 --> 00:55:27,329
35.8 percent of the vote.

365
00:55:27,329 --> 00:55:29,329
We got it from

366
00:55:29,329 --> 00:55:31,329
Sorcery. And then

367
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:33,329
get ready to nominate this one for 23 percent

368
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:35,329
and then Sorcery spell excitement.

369
00:55:35,329 --> 00:55:37,329
I mean, I said it

370
00:55:37,329 --> 00:55:39,329
like five times in a row. It was like,

371
00:55:39,329 --> 00:55:41,329
ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

372
00:55:41,329 --> 00:55:43,329
If you don't, by the way, there's probably people that have no idea what the hell that is.

373
00:55:43,329 --> 00:55:45,329
So that is a

374
00:55:45,329 --> 00:55:47,329
sound effect file from the

375
00:55:47,329 --> 00:55:49,329
Simpsons arcade game. The first

376
00:55:49,329 --> 00:55:51,329
boss of the game does that every time you hit him three or four

377
00:55:51,329 --> 00:55:53,329
times. So if you, understanding

378
00:55:53,329 --> 00:55:55,329
what that actually is from, it's

379
00:55:55,329 --> 00:55:57,329
from that game.

380
00:55:57,329 --> 00:55:59,630
And by the way,

381
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:01,630
speaking of shit categories,

382
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:03,630
by the way, I did talk to production

383
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:05,630
earlier about, man, this category

384
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:07,630
takes way too long. This is going to take

385
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:09,630
far too long. I don't even want to, I was

386
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:11,630
going to remove it last second.

387
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:13,630
I was going to say, let's not do it

388
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:15,630
because it's worst cat puke.

389
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:17,630
There's like 40, there's like 20 or 30

390
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:19,630
nominees. It's like an eight

391
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:21,630
minute video. So are you ready to watch eight

392
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:23,630
minutes or so? Is everybody cat puking?

393
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:29,070
Alright, I guess so.

394
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:32,340
There are no mods.

395
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:34,900
There are mods.

396
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,900
We modded random fucking people.

397
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:38,900
So people say this

398
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,900
is the best category. We'll find out.

399
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,900
Ladies and gentlemen, here are your

400
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,900
nominees for worst cat

401
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:53,659
puke of the year.

402
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:10,420
And then I move away

403
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:12,420
that they don't like.

404
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:17,469
And I start to

405
00:57:17,469 --> 00:57:19,469
fucking pass out and shit. Like, I don't know, they

406
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:21,469
freak me out. That would be so scary.

407
00:57:21,469 --> 00:57:24,670
If you're just in like a pitch

408
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:27,230
black area

409
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:32,610
and all you hear is this.

410
00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:37,219
Oh, what?

411
00:57:37,219 --> 00:57:39,219
Let me try that brew.

412
00:57:39,219 --> 00:57:41,969
You can just

413
00:57:41,969 --> 00:57:44,139
hear the crunch of

414
00:57:44,139 --> 00:57:47,920
the bread.

415
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,920
Do you need a handsaw to cut through a piece of

416
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:54,849
fucking bread?

417
00:57:54,849 --> 00:57:56,849
We're going to narrow this down to three.

418
00:57:56,849 --> 00:57:58,849
To be clear, you can't decide 15

419
00:57:58,849 --> 00:58:00,849
wins.

420
00:58:00,849 --> 00:58:02,849
The penultimate round is here. Let's see

421
00:58:02,849 --> 00:58:04,849
god damn things.

422
00:58:04,849 --> 00:58:09,260
Oh,

423
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:15,340
nice. Holy shit, I was on camera. You got

424
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:17,340
to see what it looked like. I mean, you don't

425
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:19,340
you know, I'm not talking about like you like

426
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:21,340
no, you

427
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:23,340
pick it up and you like

428
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:25,340
fold it up and

429
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:31,300
you eat it.

430
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,300
I don't know. That was fucked up. I was having problems.

431
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,300
My internet's fine.

432
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:38,369
It must be maintenance.

433
00:58:40,369 --> 00:58:42,610
Natural peanut butter with the oil

434
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:44,610
that settles and you have to

435
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:46,610
mix it up a little bit or I'm

436
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:48,610
telling you, man, sometimes I just scoop in there and I get

437
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:50,610
a bunch of the top layer oil and a little bit

438
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,610
of the top layer of peanut butter.

439
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:54,610
I eat it. It's delicious.

440
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:56,610
You're drinking the oil. I'm not

441
00:58:56,610 --> 00:58:58,610
I don't

442
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:00,610
tip it up and like

443
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:02,610
no, I'm talking to you. It's like a little

444
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:04,610
test. It's a little tasting like

445
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:06,610
that's it, man.

446
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:12,880
I need the inspiration.

447
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,309
What's the point of this?

448
00:59:15,309 --> 00:59:19,280
Oh, thank god.

449
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:34,900
There's too many of these.

450
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:36,900
Way too many of these.

451
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:38,900
I can eyeball that. I'm really good

452
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:40,900
with that.

453
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,900
Sorry.

454
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,900
Pumpkins just broke me.

455
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:58,829
Cappies.

456
00:59:58,829 --> 01:00:00,829
There are way too many of those.

457
01:00:00,829 --> 01:00:03,010
I lost count. How many were

458
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:05,010
there actually? How many nominees were there?

459
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:10,829
Twenty?

460
01:00:10,829 --> 01:00:12,829
Why would I?

461
01:00:12,829 --> 01:00:14,829
Alright, that's never coming back.

462
01:00:14,829 --> 01:00:16,829
Here you go. Here's the last time you'll ever hear

463
01:00:16,829 --> 01:00:23,619
that sound. It's very cold.

464
01:00:23,619 --> 01:00:26,500
It's supposed to be hot cocoa

465
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,800
in my hot cocoa poetry power.

466
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,800
Okay, so the winner, who cares?

467
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,800
Does anybody give a shit about this?

468
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,800
Who actually cares? Pre-recorded

469
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:37,739
Andy.

470
01:00:37,739 --> 01:00:41,329
What do you say?

471
01:00:43,699 --> 01:00:45,699
There are 27 categories.

472
01:00:45,699 --> 01:00:51,389
Ladies and gentlemen, your winner

473
01:00:51,389 --> 01:00:53,760
for worst cat puke

474
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,000
is...

475
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,460
What do you think? Actual cat puke

476
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:01,460
at 14.4%.

477
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:03,460
I probably saw that one coming.

478
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:05,460
Pitch black

479
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:07,460
cat puke at 14.

480
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:09,460
It was very close.

481
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:11,460
And then eating eggs

482
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:13,460
with 9.8%. By the way,

483
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:15,460
I think two or three years running now,

484
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:17,460
this is the most skipped category.

485
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:19,460
Almost 20% of you

486
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:21,460
that took this poll just skipped it.

487
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:25,809
What's going on?

488
01:01:25,809 --> 01:01:30,079
What's that? The hacker is ahead

489
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:32,079
of you. I don't understand what that

490
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:36,559
means. What's going on back

491
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:40,719
here? Why is that happening?

492
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:42,719
Can you put it back to the snow? I want people to think

493
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:44,719
I'm in an actual place with snow.

494
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:49,710
Hold on. Hey, hey, hey!

495
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:52,579
You too.

496
01:01:52,579 --> 01:01:54,579
What's going on with my backdrop?

497
01:01:54,579 --> 01:01:56,579
Your backdrop

498
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:58,579
is supposed to be snow, and there's like

499
01:01:58,579 --> 01:02:00,579
meme shit on it.

500
01:02:00,579 --> 01:02:02,820
Are you going to try something?

501
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:06,340
This usually works. Well, whatever it is,

502
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:08,829
it didn't work. You know what?

503
01:02:08,829 --> 01:02:10,829
Why don't we mess with him back?

504
01:02:10,829 --> 01:02:13,070
Why don't we send something that's really going to mess this stuff up?

505
01:02:13,070 --> 01:02:15,070
Hello!

506
01:02:15,070 --> 01:02:17,070
Stop talking!

507
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:19,070
Who the fuck are you? Who am I? Who are you?

508
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:21,070
What are you doing on my stream?

509
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,070
What do you mean, your stream?

510
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:25,070
This is my Christmas special. What are you doing here?

511
01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:27,070
Is this the guy? Is this the fucking guy

512
01:02:27,070 --> 01:02:29,070
right here?

513
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:31,070
Hey, bro! What's up?

514
01:02:31,070 --> 01:02:33,070
Hey, bro!

515
01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:35,070
Did you just hack it?

516
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:37,070
Oh, he's a hacker! Wow!

517
01:02:37,070 --> 01:02:39,070
He's so skilled. He's so

518
01:02:39,070 --> 01:02:41,070
talented. It's the extinguisher.

519
01:02:41,070 --> 01:02:43,070
Wait, what?

520
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:45,070
You will call me by my name.

521
01:02:45,070 --> 01:02:47,070
The extinguisher.

522
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:49,070
Your name is the extinguisher?

523
01:02:49,070 --> 01:02:51,070
That's right.

524
01:02:51,070 --> 01:02:53,070
Did you get that name from like the fifth grade?

525
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:55,070
What a terrible name.

526
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:57,070
It was sixth grade.

527
01:02:57,070 --> 01:02:59,070
The extinguisher. Okay, extinguisher.

528
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:01,070
How are you? How are things?

529
01:03:01,070 --> 01:03:03,070
Why? What are you doing?

530
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:05,070
What is your goal here?

531
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:07,070
Oh, my goal?

532
01:03:07,070 --> 01:03:09,070
My goal is to get you to apologize for all the things

533
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:11,070
you haven't accomplished.

534
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:13,070
I've accomplished tons of stuff. We've got Dollhouse.

535
01:03:13,070 --> 01:03:15,070
What about the hundred gifted subs?

536
01:03:17,309 --> 01:03:19,309
Hundred gifted subs.

537
01:03:19,309 --> 01:03:21,309
What do you mean?

538
01:03:21,309 --> 01:03:23,309
What about you not playing Yakuza?

539
01:03:23,309 --> 01:03:25,309
I thought you were going to play that one.

540
01:03:25,309 --> 01:03:27,309
Yeah, I'm going to.

541
01:03:27,309 --> 01:03:29,309
I didn't play Yakuza. That's why you hacked the stream.

542
01:03:29,309 --> 01:03:31,309
At two billion dollars of debt,

543
01:03:31,309 --> 01:03:33,309
what are you? The government?

544
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:35,309
That's, all right. Well, first of all,

545
01:03:35,309 --> 01:03:37,309
there's a couple things. Let me rebuttal.

546
01:03:37,309 --> 01:03:39,309
After I rebuttal, maybe you'll give the channel back.

547
01:03:39,309 --> 01:03:41,309
Maybe when you play Glover,

548
01:03:41,309 --> 01:03:43,309
I'll give the channel back.

549
01:03:43,309 --> 01:03:45,309
I played Glover! That game sucked!

550
01:03:45,309 --> 01:03:47,309
What do you mean, play Glover? Is that what you're really on about here?

551
01:03:47,309 --> 01:03:49,309
And the chat loves it.

552
01:03:49,309 --> 01:03:51,309
All right. Well, I kind of don't give a shit

553
01:03:51,309 --> 01:03:53,309
about anything that you're saying right now,

554
01:03:53,309 --> 01:03:55,309
because number one, I did try

555
01:03:55,309 --> 01:03:57,309
to give the community subs a hundred.

556
01:03:57,309 --> 01:03:59,309
My credit card got declined like five times.

557
01:03:59,309 --> 01:04:01,309
I did try. My credit card got declined like five times.

558
01:04:01,309 --> 01:04:03,309
That's literally what you sound like.

559
01:04:03,309 --> 01:04:05,309
Did you get his fucking area yet?

560
01:04:07,489 --> 01:04:09,489
You're never going to find me, Jerma.

561
01:04:09,489 --> 01:04:11,489
So what the hell?

562
01:04:11,489 --> 01:04:13,489
You just come in to taunt us? Is that what you're doing?

563
01:04:13,489 --> 01:04:15,789
Is that the fun you're going to have here?

564
01:04:15,789 --> 01:04:17,789
What are you doing? Yeah, that's why I'm here.

565
01:04:17,789 --> 01:04:19,789
Thank you. And I'm here to

566
01:04:19,789 --> 01:04:21,789
give the people what they want.

567
01:04:21,789 --> 01:04:23,789
Yeah. And what is that again?

568
01:04:23,789 --> 01:04:25,789
You're just hacking the channel? That's funny.

569
01:04:25,789 --> 01:04:27,789
That's funny. Everyone's laughing about it.

570
01:04:27,789 --> 01:04:29,789
I'm sure it's fun. Look at them.

571
01:04:29,789 --> 01:04:31,789
Look at them in the chat. Okay, well, thank you.

572
01:04:31,789 --> 01:04:33,789
I appreciate hearing from you. Now, can you please leave me alone?

573
01:04:33,789 --> 01:04:35,789
Should I have to do? Leave me the fuck alone.

574
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:37,789
Wow. No?

575
01:04:37,789 --> 01:04:40,539
Yeah, great respond.

576
01:04:40,539 --> 01:04:42,539
No. That's the answer?

577
01:04:42,539 --> 01:04:44,539
No. Okay.

578
01:04:44,539 --> 01:04:46,539
Well, you know what?

579
01:04:46,539 --> 01:04:48,539
What do you got? What do you got?

580
01:04:48,539 --> 01:04:50,539
Why don't we send him something fucked up?

581
01:04:50,539 --> 01:04:52,539
How does that sound? Do you guys have a connection?

582
01:04:52,539 --> 01:04:54,539
Do you have a connection? What if I do this?

583
01:04:54,539 --> 01:04:56,539
Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean? What?

584
01:04:56,539 --> 01:04:58,539
What if I do this? Huh? Stop doing that.

585
01:04:58,539 --> 01:05:00,909
Ah. That's funny.

586
01:05:00,909 --> 01:05:02,909
That's so fun, is it? That is great.

587
01:05:02,909 --> 01:05:04,909
I saw the IP address. Was that an IP?

588
01:05:04,909 --> 01:05:06,909
Yeah, try that on for size.

589
01:05:06,909 --> 01:05:08,909
Get that shit off.

590
01:05:08,909 --> 01:05:10,909
Look at your face. It's so angry.

591
01:05:10,909 --> 01:05:12,909
You're such an asshole.

592
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,909
You have a connection, right? Send something back.

593
01:05:14,909 --> 01:05:16,909
Go ahead. Send something back, guys.

594
01:05:16,909 --> 01:05:18,909
Eat shit, you hacker!

595
01:05:18,909 --> 01:05:20,909
It's the extinguisher.

596
01:05:20,909 --> 01:05:22,909
You will learn my name by the end of the stream.

597
01:05:24,909 --> 01:05:26,909
Follow me, old chum.

598
01:05:26,909 --> 01:05:28,909
I'm not a gnome.

599
01:05:28,909 --> 01:05:30,909
I'm not a gnoblin.

600
01:05:30,909 --> 01:05:32,909
Did you do that? Yeah.

601
01:05:32,909 --> 01:05:34,909
I'm a gnome. What year is it?

602
01:05:34,909 --> 01:05:36,909
Can you be gnome?

603
01:05:36,909 --> 01:05:38,909
I want to tell me what year it is.

604
01:05:38,909 --> 01:05:40,909
You're gonna gnome the guy?

605
01:05:40,909 --> 01:05:42,909
That's so fucking stupid.

606
01:05:42,909 --> 01:05:44,909
You're gonna gnome me on a live stream

607
01:05:44,909 --> 01:05:46,909
with over 20,000 people?

608
01:05:46,909 --> 01:05:48,909
That's so 2017.

609
01:05:48,909 --> 01:05:50,909
I don't...

610
01:05:50,909 --> 01:05:52,909
Why would you gnome somebody?

611
01:05:52,909 --> 01:05:54,909
That's all you can do back...

612
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:57,150
Get his

613
01:05:57,150 --> 01:05:59,150
location and send

614
01:05:59,150 --> 01:06:01,150
something else. Get us back

615
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:03,150
access for the love of God.

616
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:06,099
Give me a fucking break, dude.

617
01:06:06,099 --> 01:06:09,039
You send a gnome

618
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:11,039
over there. You know how bad that

619
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:14,369
makes me look? We got

620
01:06:14,369 --> 01:06:16,369
CatboyGerma. We got the Suski.

621
01:06:16,369 --> 01:06:18,369
He even turned off...

622
01:06:18,369 --> 01:06:20,369
We can't even turn this back to normal.

623
01:06:20,369 --> 01:06:22,539
What a disaster.

624
01:06:22,539 --> 01:06:24,539
Anyways,

625
01:06:24,539 --> 01:06:26,539
I may have made a few of these,

626
01:06:26,539 --> 01:06:29,099
but...

627
01:06:29,099 --> 01:06:32,179
You know, let's just get right into it.

628
01:06:32,179 --> 01:06:34,179
Everybody's waiting for this category,

629
01:06:34,179 --> 01:06:36,179
and it's a good one, so let's take our time with it.

630
01:06:36,179 --> 01:06:38,179
Ladies and gentlemen, here are the nominees

631
01:06:38,179 --> 01:06:40,179
for worst face

632
01:06:40,179 --> 01:06:42,179
of the year.

633
01:06:42,179 --> 01:06:46,019
Fucking gnome the guy.

634
01:06:46,019 --> 01:06:54,460
Unbelievable.

635
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:57,090
Now listen here, Batman.

636
01:06:57,090 --> 01:06:59,090
I think that's what's gonna happen.

637
01:06:59,090 --> 01:07:04,719
Turn the webcam on.

638
01:07:04,719 --> 01:07:20,210
I can see the music!

639
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:23,659
That was such an ugly face. I hate that one.

640
01:07:23,659 --> 01:07:26,099
You look very handsome today.

641
01:07:26,099 --> 01:07:29,809
Thanks.

642
01:07:29,809 --> 01:07:38,510
This is bullshit again.

643
01:07:38,510 --> 01:07:42,030
He didn't do that before!

644
01:07:42,030 --> 01:07:46,699
Don't go

645
01:07:46,699 --> 01:07:48,699
4-2 back,

646
01:07:48,699 --> 01:07:50,699
because you're flipping spawns.

647
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:52,699
Yeah.

648
01:07:52,699 --> 01:07:54,699
Just contain mid control, and just hold them out and spawn.

649
01:07:54,699 --> 01:07:56,699
We should be fine.

650
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:09,500
Wow!

651
01:08:17,819 --> 01:08:19,819
That wasn't even a real fight.

652
01:08:19,819 --> 01:08:21,819
You can see every inch of my face, too.

653
01:08:21,819 --> 01:08:23,819
I don't like this.

654
01:08:23,819 --> 01:08:26,000
I hate this.

655
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,430
Oh!

656
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:30,430
Holy shit, people are so ugly with light, aren't they?

657
01:08:32,430 --> 01:08:34,670
See? This is me.

658
01:08:34,670 --> 01:08:37,489
This is my face.

659
01:08:55,979 --> 01:08:57,979
Do you honestly think I don't know the horse has a dodge

660
01:08:57,979 --> 01:09:00,539
65 hours into the game?

661
01:09:00,539 --> 01:09:10,140
I thought she was doing another move.

662
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:12,140
I thought that was the big sweeping one.

663
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:14,140
Oh my god.

664
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:16,140
Fuck this fight.

665
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:18,140
Fuck this game. Return it.

666
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:20,140
I don't have 100 hours in it, but I'm returning it.

667
01:09:20,140 --> 01:09:22,140
I'm going up to the counter with these eyes like this.

668
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:24,140
The fucking GameStop that I got this piece of shit from.

669
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:26,140
They're gonna be like,

670
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:28,140
Hey, I would like to make a return, please.

671
01:09:30,770 --> 01:09:32,770
More games for your wax face.

672
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:45,100
Find me a path I can go.

673
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:47,100
Find me one path.

674
01:09:47,100 --> 01:10:03,279
That was weird.

675
01:10:07,279 --> 01:10:09,279
Abbott's a holy man.

676
01:10:09,279 --> 01:10:11,279
Okay.

677
01:10:15,279 --> 01:10:17,279
I wonder where I go from here, though.

678
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:19,279
If I had to keep it all in,

679
01:10:19,279 --> 01:10:21,279
After like an hour, I'd be like this.

680
01:10:21,279 --> 01:10:23,279
It would be insane.

681
01:10:23,279 --> 01:10:27,380
I would explode.

682
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:30,449
Okay.

683
01:10:30,449 --> 01:10:40,109
Put that in here.

684
01:10:40,109 --> 01:10:45,869
I'm just going up the stairs.

685
01:10:45,869 --> 01:10:51,439
I don't give a shit if he hears me.

686
01:10:51,439 --> 01:10:55,409
I thought he was downstairs.

687
01:10:58,289 --> 01:11:10,689
In a circle.

688
01:11:10,689 --> 01:11:14,529
That was the chicken.

689
01:11:14,529 --> 01:11:16,529
That was the fucking rooster.

690
01:11:16,529 --> 01:11:18,529
That was a rooster.

691
01:11:18,529 --> 01:11:20,529
That was actually a rooster.

692
01:11:20,529 --> 01:11:22,529
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.

693
01:11:22,529 --> 01:11:36,859
Fuck you.

694
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:40,770
Come on.

695
01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:42,770
Is there an O-Rick?

696
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:46,220
Was that an O-Rick

697
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:48,220
at the end? What was that?

698
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:52,640
O-Rick.

699
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,640
Yeah, I have a tendency to make faces.

700
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,640
But, you know,

701
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,640
whatever. It is what it is.

702
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,640
This is going to be news

703
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,640
to me because we don't know.

704
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,880
Ladies and gentlemen, the winner

705
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,880
of the worst face of the

706
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,880
year. It was pretty close.

707
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:11,699
You look very handsome

708
01:12:11,699 --> 01:12:13,699
today. At 16.8%

709
01:12:13,699 --> 01:12:15,699
of the vote.

710
01:12:15,699 --> 01:12:17,699
Germa cheesed is a little bit further after that

711
01:12:17,699 --> 01:12:19,699
at 11.4%.

712
01:12:19,699 --> 01:12:21,699
And then smushed sleeping face.

713
01:12:21,699 --> 01:12:23,699
Which, if you had asked me, I thought

714
01:12:23,699 --> 01:12:25,939
would have been number one.

715
01:12:25,939 --> 01:12:27,939
So you look very handsome today.

716
01:12:27,939 --> 01:12:29,939
This one.

717
01:12:29,939 --> 01:12:31,939
That one there. I do that apparently frequently.

718
01:12:31,939 --> 01:12:33,939
But, yeah.

719
01:12:33,939 --> 01:12:39,180
You look very handsome today.

720
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:41,180
It's this one.

721
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:43,180
That's fine.

722
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:45,180
You can't nominate this stream

723
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:47,180
because it's literally

724
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:49,180
the day we're doing this.

725
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:51,180
We're going to do best accident now.

726
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:53,489
Rick!

727
01:12:53,489 --> 01:12:56,239
Best accident is when something goes

728
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:58,239
wrong during a stream

729
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:00,239
and we need to figure out how

730
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:02,239
to fix it. So that's where we

731
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:04,239
are now. This is

732
01:13:04,239 --> 01:13:06,239
the sixth category. Still plenty.

733
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:08,239
Still plenty to do today.

734
01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:10,239
So, ladies and gentlemen, here are your nominees

735
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:12,239
for best accident of the year.

736
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:21,579
Blue Bunny

737
01:13:21,579 --> 01:13:23,579
makes the best grocery store ice cream.

738
01:13:23,579 --> 01:13:25,579
Without a doubt. It's by a mile.

739
01:13:25,579 --> 01:13:29,680
Here. Blue Bunny.

740
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:32,050
Chocolate. Chocolate ice cream. It's fluffy.

741
01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:45,359
It's pillowy.

742
01:14:00,210 --> 01:14:03,729
Don't do it down there.

743
01:14:03,729 --> 01:14:05,729
Don't do it down there. Don't do it down here.

744
01:14:05,729 --> 01:14:07,729
Don't do that down here.

745
01:14:07,729 --> 01:14:09,970
You do not want this

746
01:14:09,970 --> 01:14:11,970
down here.

747
01:14:11,970 --> 01:14:13,970
It's time to fight some crime.

748
01:14:13,970 --> 01:14:17,100
Made some adjustments to my suit.

749
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:20,050
I feel like it's a little more appropriate.

750
01:14:20,050 --> 01:14:25,100
Let's go.

751
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:33,869
Are you fucking kidding me?

752
01:14:33,869 --> 01:14:38,539
What are you?

753
01:14:38,539 --> 01:14:43,460
Those!

754
01:14:43,460 --> 01:14:46,079
No, I'm doing the thing. I'm doing the thing that

755
01:14:46,079 --> 01:14:48,079
fucking meme.

756
01:14:48,079 --> 01:14:50,079
I'm not grunting.

757
01:14:50,079 --> 01:14:52,079
What sex noises are you talking about?

758
01:14:52,079 --> 01:14:54,079
I've been silent the whole time.

759
01:14:54,079 --> 01:15:00,479
I've been silent the whole time.

760
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:02,720
What are you talking about?

761
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:15,520
I've been silent the whole time.

762
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:17,520
What?

763
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:21,039
What the fuck?

764
01:15:21,039 --> 01:15:27,869
Security camera.

765
01:15:27,869 --> 01:15:35,739
What the fuck?

766
01:15:35,739 --> 01:15:37,739
Why is it going so high?

767
01:15:37,739 --> 01:15:39,739
Here's your glove.

768
01:15:39,739 --> 01:15:42,880
It fits perfectly.

769
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:45,180
As you see.

770
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:47,180
It fits perfectly.

771
01:15:47,180 --> 01:15:49,180
I promise. I promise I didn't

772
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:51,420
sit on it.

773
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:53,859
I'm going to do this.

774
01:15:53,859 --> 01:15:55,859
And get really mad.

775
01:15:55,859 --> 01:15:57,859
And get very upset that I sat on it.

776
01:15:57,859 --> 01:16:00,220
Rebna?

777
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:03,739
Kalidna.

778
01:16:03,739 --> 01:16:05,739
We need to know and I'm going to reload it.

779
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:16,100
Okay, that's enough of that.

780
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:18,100
That's enough of that one. That's it.

781
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:20,100
We're not doing that one again.

782
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:22,100
We're not doing that one ever again.

783
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:24,100
It's good, yeah.

784
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:27,100
And I was talking about a little recipe that I had.

785
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:29,100
If you don't know what hamburger, this is what it looks like.

786
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:33,250
It doesn't look like that.

787
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:35,250
It doesn't look like that. It looks like this.

788
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:46,369
Whip cream?

789
01:16:46,369 --> 01:16:48,369
I have to wait an all week to do this one.

790
01:16:48,369 --> 01:16:51,760
Alright, get in there.

791
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:55,600
I don't think I made it.

792
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,600
I'm assuming it missed.

793
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:59,600
I can't tell.

794
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:01,600
Do not flip the cart.

795
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,600
Under any circumstance. Don't do it.

796
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,600
It's not funny. It's not a joke.

797
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,779
It would be annoying

798
01:17:07,779 --> 01:17:09,779
because you just wasted like 35

799
01:17:09,779 --> 01:17:11,949
minutes cutting wood.

800
01:17:11,949 --> 01:17:14,260
Jeremy, I know you think you're

801
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:16,430
quite the Canadian,

802
01:17:16,430 --> 01:17:18,930
but this is not the time to do that.

803
01:17:18,930 --> 01:17:24,619
Let's go. And a lot of people are going to think

804
01:17:24,619 --> 01:17:26,619
that that was on purpose, but it was not.

805
01:17:26,619 --> 01:17:28,989
And I...

806
01:17:28,989 --> 01:17:30,989
You gotta be fucking kidding me, man.

807
01:17:30,989 --> 01:17:37,579
I'm going to quit the game.

808
01:17:37,579 --> 01:17:41,680
I make a lot of mistakes.

809
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:43,680
I see the spam in the chat.

810
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:45,680
We're working on it.

811
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:48,239
Just relax.

812
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:51,119
We're working on it.

813
01:17:51,119 --> 01:17:53,119
That's up a lot. It seems to be a theme

814
01:17:53,119 --> 01:17:55,119
on the channel, doesn't it?

815
01:17:55,119 --> 01:17:57,119
Let's see. Ladies and gentlemen, the winner

816
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:59,119
of Best Accident is...

817
01:17:59,119 --> 01:18:03,539
Let's find out.

818
01:18:03,539 --> 01:18:07,119
I mean, you

819
01:18:07,119 --> 01:18:09,119
could have guessed this was going to be the one.

820
01:18:09,119 --> 01:18:12,319
The mask falls off Spider-Man

821
01:18:12,319 --> 01:18:14,319
at 15.6% of the vote.

822
01:18:14,319 --> 01:18:16,750
Nice job, Spider-Man.

823
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:18,750
You get to see the outline of my

824
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:20,750
dick if you zoomed in.

825
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:22,750
I mean, don't do

826
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:24,750
that, but if you can see the outline of my

827
01:18:24,750 --> 01:18:26,750
dick, whatever, that's fine.

828
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:28,750
My favorite ice cream, let's take a look at

829
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:30,750
11.8%,

830
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:33,119
which that's sad, because I really

831
01:18:33,119 --> 01:18:35,119
do think that that is the... I think that is the

832
01:18:35,119 --> 01:18:39,020
best ice cream. That's so

833
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:41,020
fucking stupid. I was so disappointed.

834
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:43,020
And then Booty Smash at 11%,

835
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:45,020
it took up...

836
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:47,020
This is pretty even.

837
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:49,199
It looks like

838
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:51,199
everything after Booty Smash

839
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:53,199
was within 1%.

840
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:55,199
So everything below that

841
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:57,199
was just within

842
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:59,199
1% of each other, so...

843
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:01,199
Make sure I'm not going to see my

844
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:03,199
dick on this stream. Okay.

845
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:05,199
Don't want to do that.

846
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:07,199
Alright, after this, we're going to take a quick

847
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:09,199
break after this, because I'm going to try to get back

848
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:11,199
on the goddamn channel.

849
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:13,199
We're going to go dark for a second,

850
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:15,199
but this is best overdone Boston

851
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:17,199
moment, if you don't know what that is.

852
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:19,199
So best overdone Boston moment, I'll give you an

853
01:19:19,199 --> 01:19:27,710
example. This fucking cookie

854
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:30,270
sucks, dude. Where'd you get these fucking cookies?

855
01:19:30,270 --> 01:19:34,109
In the fucking toilet?

856
01:19:34,109 --> 01:19:36,800
Where'd you find this? In a fucking dumpster?

857
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,800
New category this year, by the way.

858
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,800
This is a new category.

859
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,800
So here are your nominees

860
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,800
for best overdone Boston

861
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:47,489
moment. Don't show

862
01:19:47,489 --> 01:19:56,319
my dick on camera.

863
01:19:56,319 --> 01:19:58,319
I know I got what he was coming to him, man. Don't worry.

864
01:19:58,319 --> 01:20:00,319
I got plenty left for you, you fucking idiot.

865
01:20:00,319 --> 01:20:02,689
Okay, good.

866
01:20:02,689 --> 01:20:05,760
Ultimate destruction!

867
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,760
Yes!

868
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:09,760
It's a stupid fucking dumb fucking stupid fucking game. Fucking game's fucking stupid.

869
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:11,760
Yeah, that's fucking stupid.

870
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,760
Yeah!

871
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,760
I hate this fucking category.

872
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:21,340
Your Boston's showing.

873
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:23,340
Three, two, one.

874
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:25,340
Happy fucking New Year!

875
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:27,649
And a

876
01:20:27,649 --> 01:20:29,649
dear

877
01:20:29,649 --> 01:20:31,649
and a

878
01:20:31,649 --> 01:20:33,649
dear old Lang Syne.

879
01:20:33,649 --> 01:20:36,399
And

880
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:38,399
all the Red

881
01:20:38,399 --> 01:20:40,399
Sox players

882
01:20:40,399 --> 01:20:42,399
should fucking

883
01:20:42,399 --> 01:20:44,399
get paid more than the

884
01:20:44,399 --> 01:20:46,399
Yankees do.

885
01:20:46,399 --> 01:20:49,149
And all

886
01:20:49,149 --> 01:20:51,149
the patriots

887
01:20:51,149 --> 01:20:53,149
who cares about Tom Brady.

888
01:20:53,149 --> 01:20:55,149
He's a fucking loser.

889
01:20:55,149 --> 01:20:57,149
I don't even fucking

890
01:20:57,149 --> 01:20:59,779
care.

891
01:20:59,779 --> 01:21:01,779
And all

892
01:21:01,779 --> 01:21:03,779
the revolution

893
01:21:03,779 --> 01:21:05,779
soccer team and the Bruins.

894
01:21:05,779 --> 01:21:07,779
And fuck you

895
01:21:07,779 --> 01:21:09,779
for fucking talking shit to me about my

896
01:21:09,779 --> 01:21:11,779
mother behind my back that one time that year.

897
01:21:11,779 --> 01:21:13,779
And I fucking never forgot.

898
01:21:13,779 --> 01:21:16,460
Do you still consider

899
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:18,460
yourself a Bostonian?

900
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:20,460
Of course I do, kid. Did you just take Boston?

901
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:22,829
No.

902
01:21:22,829 --> 01:21:24,829
That's fucking bullshit, dude.

903
01:21:24,829 --> 01:21:26,829
Alright, kid, listen, that's fucking stupid.

904
01:21:26,829 --> 01:21:28,829
Alright, fucking listen, kid.

905
01:21:28,829 --> 01:21:30,829
I'll see you outside any

906
01:21:30,829 --> 01:21:32,829
donkeys anytime. Oh, shut the fuck up.

907
01:21:32,829 --> 01:21:34,829
You bring a pack of cigarettes and I'll fucking see you there.

908
01:21:34,829 --> 01:21:36,829
Hey, hey, hey.

909
01:21:36,829 --> 01:21:39,520
Hey. What are those

910
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,520
brown slacks called?

911
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,520
Oh, they're called cockies.

912
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:45,760
How do you drive your car?

913
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:47,760
Oh, with fucking cockies.

914
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:51,760
Jeremy, you're spending so much fucking time with these ants.

915
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:54,449
I mean, there's other shit to do with them.

916
01:21:54,449 --> 01:21:56,449
You're spending a lot of time with these fucking ants.

917
01:21:56,449 --> 01:21:58,449
I can't believe I did this this much.

918
01:21:58,449 --> 01:22:00,449
You've been outside a lot.

919
01:22:00,449 --> 01:22:02,449
You're just like digging around looking for fucking ants.

920
01:22:02,449 --> 01:22:04,449
I don't know what is

921
01:22:04,449 --> 01:22:06,449
getting a little concerned about you.

922
01:22:06,449 --> 01:22:08,449
I love how I've turned

923
01:22:08,449 --> 01:22:10,449
you guys like the Boston accent

924
01:22:10,449 --> 01:22:12,449
guy into things that

925
01:22:12,449 --> 01:22:14,449
like I'm allowed to kind of come out of

926
01:22:14,449 --> 01:22:16,449
my like I can just say whatever I want

927
01:22:16,449 --> 01:22:18,449
as that voice, that character.

928
01:22:18,449 --> 01:22:20,449
And it's universally despised

929
01:22:20,449 --> 01:22:22,449
anything I say. I don't know why it has to be like

930
01:22:22,449 --> 01:22:24,449
the Boston guy with the cigarette

931
01:22:24,449 --> 01:22:26,449
outside of a CVS.

932
01:22:26,449 --> 01:22:28,449
I don't know why it has to be that guy.

933
01:22:28,449 --> 01:22:32,350
I wish they were

934
01:22:32,350 --> 01:22:34,350
fucking two drive-throughs, three drive-through windows

935
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:36,350
instead of one at like every restaurant.

936
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:39,489
Alright, dude, like

937
01:22:39,489 --> 01:22:43,819
Okay. This fucking game

938
01:22:43,819 --> 01:22:48,560
is fucking stupid.

939
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:51,949
Where does it want me to go?

940
01:22:51,949 --> 01:22:53,949
Chad, do you fucking, what was it?

941
01:22:53,949 --> 01:22:58,619
This game is for fucking kids. I don't give a fuck.

942
01:22:58,619 --> 01:23:02,210
I'm playing a fucking kids game.

943
01:23:02,210 --> 01:23:04,210
And you guys are fucking shit in the fucking chat.

944
01:23:04,210 --> 01:23:06,960
Yeah, okay.

945
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,779
Pickle nose, pickle nose.

946
01:23:09,779 --> 01:23:12,340
Fucking say that?

947
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:14,510
Pickle nose?

948
01:23:14,510 --> 01:23:16,510
Fuck up.

949
01:23:16,510 --> 01:23:20,479
What's up, dude?

950
01:23:20,479 --> 01:23:22,479
That armor is pretty fucking cool. That's pretty sick armor.

951
01:23:22,479 --> 01:23:24,479
I can't take this anymore.

952
01:23:24,479 --> 01:23:26,479
I mean, I got magic defense

953
01:23:26,479 --> 01:23:28,479
on it, though, pretty fucking low.

954
01:23:28,479 --> 01:23:30,479
With just two more minutes.

955
01:23:30,479 --> 01:23:32,479
My tail light does stuff like that, too, but magic is pretty low on it, right?

956
01:23:32,479 --> 01:23:34,479
Alright, fuck. Alright, kid.

957
01:23:34,479 --> 01:23:36,479
Alright, I'll fucking see you later.

958
01:23:36,479 --> 01:23:40,510
Hey, mom, I said hi.

959
01:23:40,510 --> 01:23:42,510
I don't know, not in like a weird, you know what I mean?

960
01:23:42,510 --> 01:23:44,510
That was like supposed to be respectful.

961
01:23:44,510 --> 01:23:46,510
That was not supposed to be mean.

962
01:23:46,510 --> 01:23:51,760
I weren't ready for the fucking rain of stars.

963
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,760
Hey.

964
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:55,760
What about, you know, fucking starlight, kid?

965
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:57,760
Oh, fucking starlight.

966
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:59,760
I fucking hate this.

967
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:01,760
I'm annoying.

968
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:03,760
How do we cut this category off quick?

969
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:05,760
I'm farming for souls, so I don't want to die at the boss.

970
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,760
The boss is probably going to be hard.

971
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:09,760
Oh, you're causing

972
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:12,260
from Boston.

973
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:14,260
It's a fucking lager. You don't know what a lager is, dude?

974
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:16,260
I'm your causing.

975
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:18,689
I wasn't looking.

976
01:24:18,689 --> 01:24:20,689
Oh, so I was back in Massachusetts, right?

977
01:24:20,689 --> 01:24:22,689
Because I'm saying it's going to be the wedding stuff.

978
01:24:22,689 --> 01:24:25,180
And I could tell I was back in

979
01:24:25,180 --> 01:24:27,180
Massachusetts. It's been a while.

980
01:24:27,180 --> 01:24:29,180
I was driving.

981
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:31,180
And I just hear

982
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:33,180
I'm just sitting there and I pull up through a red light.

983
01:24:33,180 --> 01:24:35,180
And I just hear out the window.

984
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:37,180
You fucking

985
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:39,180
douchebag.

986
01:24:39,180 --> 01:24:41,180
Somebody was just screaming at somebody.

987
01:24:41,180 --> 01:24:43,180
They do just kind of stand here. They're all fucking

988
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:45,619
terrible. Hey, what's

989
01:24:45,619 --> 01:24:47,619
in the telescope? What are you looking at, Maz?

990
01:24:47,619 --> 01:24:49,619
Look at that.

991
01:24:49,619 --> 01:24:51,619
Oh, look at this artwork.

992
01:24:51,619 --> 01:24:53,619
Look at this artwork.

993
01:24:53,619 --> 01:24:55,619
Why is it snowing?

994
01:24:55,619 --> 01:24:57,619
That fucking foxy comes out of there.

995
01:24:57,619 --> 01:24:59,859
I heard this.

996
01:24:59,859 --> 01:25:01,859
My fucking son played this one.

997
01:25:01,859 --> 01:25:03,859
Fucking foxy comes out of there and sprints down the fucking hallway.

998
01:25:03,859 --> 01:25:05,859
It was fucked up.

999
01:25:05,859 --> 01:25:07,859
They walk down halls and stuff. They fucking walk down the hall.

1000
01:25:07,859 --> 01:25:09,859
I played it before.

1001
01:25:09,859 --> 01:25:11,859
Wait.

1002
01:25:11,859 --> 01:25:15,569
Oh, shit. There it is.

1003
01:25:15,569 --> 01:25:18,640
Okay.

1004
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:20,640
I'll fucking drop this guy if he fucking comes in my...

1005
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:22,640
If he comes over to the door, I'm going to fucking drop him.

1006
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:24,640
Apparently, I have a catchphrase

1007
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:26,640
between me and my girlfriend that I don't even realize I have it.

1008
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:28,880
And apparently, I say

1009
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:30,880
like, oh, fucking like, gollick.

1010
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,880
Gollick, kid. Oh, yeah, give me some fucking

1011
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,880
gollick, dude. For no reason,

1012
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:36,880
apparently. And I'm like, no, there has to be a reason

1013
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:38,880
of why I'm saying like, oh, fucking gollick.

1014
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:40,880
I just do like a Boston accent

1015
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:42,880
joke. And I say gollick.

1016
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:51,199
Okay. So,

1017
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:53,199
the winner for...

1018
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:55,199
Is it best or worst? That's the question I have.

1019
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:57,199
It's best

1020
01:25:57,199 --> 01:25:59,199
overdone Boston moment.

1021
01:25:59,199 --> 01:26:01,199
Not worst overdone Boston moment.

1022
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:05,229
People saying Maz. Maz

1023
01:26:05,229 --> 01:26:07,229
is the one. I don't know. I actually...

1024
01:26:07,229 --> 01:26:09,229
Let's find out. Ladies and gentlemen,

1025
01:26:09,229 --> 01:26:11,229
the winner of the

1026
01:26:11,229 --> 01:26:13,229
worst overdone Boston

1027
01:26:13,229 --> 01:26:15,229
moment.

1028
01:26:15,229 --> 01:26:19,710
Really?

1029
01:26:19,710 --> 01:26:21,710
It's the gollick catchphrase

1030
01:26:21,710 --> 01:26:23,710
story at 22.2%

1031
01:26:23,710 --> 01:26:25,710
of the vote.

1032
01:26:25,710 --> 01:26:28,210
Gollick catchphrase.

1033
01:26:28,210 --> 01:26:30,210
Me explaining that I have a catchphrase.

1034
01:26:30,210 --> 01:26:32,210
And then the Tom Brady

1035
01:26:32,210 --> 01:26:34,210
New Year's Eve song

1036
01:26:34,210 --> 01:26:36,210
at 11...

1037
01:26:36,210 --> 01:26:38,210
Okay. 11.8%

1038
01:26:38,210 --> 01:26:40,210
for the New Year's Eve song.

1039
01:26:40,210 --> 01:26:42,210
And then the Boston guy plays

1040
01:26:42,210 --> 01:26:44,210
Five Nights at Freddy's

1041
01:26:44,210 --> 01:26:46,210
at 10%.

1042
01:26:46,210 --> 01:26:48,210
Also, keep this in mind, that was the second

1043
01:26:48,210 --> 01:26:50,210
most skipped category.

1044
01:26:50,210 --> 01:26:52,210
Under cat puke.

1045
01:26:52,210 --> 01:26:54,210
Nobody gave a shit

1046
01:26:54,210 --> 01:26:56,210
about that one. I don't

1047
01:26:56,210 --> 01:26:58,210
blame them. I really don't.

1048
01:26:58,210 --> 01:27:00,210
It's funny just how many things people did skip.

1049
01:27:00,210 --> 01:27:02,640
People probably went to this list

1050
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:04,640
and saw... I ain't taking all 27

1051
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:06,640
of these.

1052
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:08,640
No, I'm skipping this, we're skipping this, we're skipping this.

1053
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,640
This is the second most skipped category,

1054
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:12,640
which makes sense.

1055
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:14,640
Why don't we check in with the elves?

1056
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:16,640
How are the elves doing on the puzzle?

1057
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:19,069
Can we go take a look? How are they?

1058
01:27:19,069 --> 01:27:22,079
Elves, how are you?

1059
01:27:22,079 --> 01:27:24,319
They haven't done

1060
01:27:24,319 --> 01:27:27,329
anything.

1061
01:27:27,329 --> 01:27:29,329
It just looks like you've poured a box

1062
01:27:29,329 --> 01:27:31,329
of fruity pebbles on the ground.

1063
01:27:31,329 --> 01:27:33,329
There's nothing even there.

1064
01:27:33,329 --> 01:27:38,130
Let's stay

1065
01:27:38,130 --> 01:27:41,649
with them for a few minutes.

1066
01:27:41,649 --> 01:31:03,500
I gotta go pee. Hey, who cares

1067
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,500
if they get your channel hacked on Christmas time?

1068
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:07,500
Right? Who cares?

1069
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:09,500
Welcome back, everybody. Welcome to

1070
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:11,500
the awards show.

1071
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:13,500
Christmas special. Yes!

1072
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:15,500
Come on!

1073
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:17,869
Where is it if there's somebody playing Call of Duty

1074
01:31:17,869 --> 01:31:19,869
on my channel right now?

1075
01:31:19,869 --> 01:31:21,869
Fuck them, right?

1076
01:31:21,869 --> 01:31:23,869
We're gonna have fun over here.

1077
01:31:23,869 --> 01:31:25,869
What about the elves? What's wrong with

1078
01:31:25,869 --> 01:31:28,430
the elves?

1079
01:31:28,430 --> 01:31:30,430
It doesn't look like they just poured, like I said, a box of

1080
01:31:30,430 --> 01:31:32,430
cereal on the ground. They haven't made any progress

1081
01:31:32,430 --> 01:31:34,430
at all. Absolutely

1082
01:31:34,430 --> 01:31:39,170
zero progress.

1083
01:31:39,170 --> 01:31:41,170
Okay, so

1084
01:31:41,170 --> 01:31:43,470
how does it look today?

1085
01:31:43,470 --> 01:31:46,609
How does it look? We're doing that one now.

1086
01:31:46,609 --> 01:31:49,359
This is the

1087
01:31:49,359 --> 01:31:51,359
eighth category of the night.

1088
01:31:51,359 --> 01:31:54,939
Hey, how's that for you?

1089
01:31:54,939 --> 01:31:57,869
How's that look? This is worst

1090
01:31:57,869 --> 01:31:59,869
hair, not today, but, you know,

1091
01:31:59,869 --> 01:32:01,869
I've had some bad hair.

1092
01:32:01,869 --> 01:32:03,869
Most of these are from VR,

1093
01:32:03,869 --> 01:32:05,869
which is kind of unfair, if I'm honest.

1094
01:32:05,869 --> 01:32:08,560
I just heard the production

1095
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:10,560
go, don't open that!

1096
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:12,560
Alright, so ladies and gentlemen, here are your nominees

1097
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,560
for worst hair of the year.

1098
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:24,420
Can we please

1099
01:32:24,420 --> 01:32:38,029
get a zoinks? Fine.

1100
01:32:38,029 --> 01:32:40,340
Zoinks, Scoob!

1101
01:32:40,340 --> 01:32:42,340
I fucking banned that person. I actually banned that person

1102
01:32:42,340 --> 01:32:44,340
for like an hour, because they just made me do that

1103
01:32:44,340 --> 01:32:46,340
and I fucking hated it.

1104
01:32:46,340 --> 01:32:53,380
Want a hair check? Sure. Hold on

1105
01:32:53,380 --> 01:33:04,239
one sec. How are we?

1106
01:33:04,239 --> 01:33:09,300
I think it's because

1107
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:11,300
I like went to

1108
01:33:11,300 --> 01:33:13,300
my hair has a weird growing pattern.

1109
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:15,300
Is it that bad? Alright, it is bad.

1110
01:33:15,300 --> 01:33:17,300
But listen, my

1111
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:19,300
hair is a lot thinner here.

1112
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:21,300
Look at how much thicker my hair is here.

1113
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:23,300
Do you see?

1114
01:33:23,300 --> 01:33:25,300
It's really, I have really thick hair

1115
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:27,300
here, and really thin hair

1116
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:29,300
here. I didn't shave this.

1117
01:33:29,300 --> 01:33:34,479
You know what, I don't even care, just fuck the whole thing up.

1118
01:33:34,479 --> 01:33:47,710
What is going on?

1119
01:33:47,710 --> 01:33:49,710
I do look like a big

1120
01:33:49,710 --> 01:33:51,710
kid. What's happening right now?

1121
01:33:51,710 --> 01:33:53,710
I look like a big kid.

1122
01:33:53,710 --> 01:33:55,710
What's going on?

1123
01:33:55,710 --> 01:33:58,020
He's balding? I mean

1124
01:33:58,020 --> 01:34:00,020
yeah. Not really though.

1125
01:34:00,020 --> 01:34:02,020
I'm 36. Not really.

1126
01:34:02,020 --> 01:34:04,020
You dream you look like this

1127
01:34:04,020 --> 01:34:06,020
when you're 36. He's right.

1128
01:34:06,020 --> 01:34:08,020
You dream, keep dreaming you'll look as good as I do

1129
01:34:08,020 --> 01:34:10,020
right now. He's right. Listen to him.

1130
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:12,020
Can they hear me? Keep dreaming.

1131
01:34:12,020 --> 01:34:14,699
Wait, let me say that again when it looks better.

1132
01:34:14,699 --> 01:34:17,069
You're not going to get away

1133
01:34:17,069 --> 01:34:19,310
with that.

1134
01:34:19,310 --> 01:34:25,699
They probably heard that.

1135
01:34:25,699 --> 01:34:29,859
It's really great.

1136
01:34:29,859 --> 01:34:31,859
I don't know why. This thing was expensive too.

1137
01:34:31,859 --> 01:34:33,859
What if I go like up this way?

1138
01:34:33,859 --> 01:34:48,619
We're trying a new hairstyle.

1139
01:34:48,619 --> 01:34:50,619
This is just Donald Trump's hair.

1140
01:34:50,619 --> 01:34:52,859
On my head.

1141
01:34:52,859 --> 01:34:55,619
My hair looks like

1142
01:34:55,619 --> 01:34:57,619
it came out of the oven and it's

1143
01:34:57,619 --> 01:35:00,880
done. This looks like

1144
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:05,229
cooked hair. My hair

1145
01:35:05,229 --> 01:35:07,229
looks different. It's done now. It's ready.

1146
01:35:07,229 --> 01:35:09,229
I wanted to stream today.

1147
01:35:09,229 --> 01:35:11,789
Why do your sideburns look like

1148
01:35:11,789 --> 01:35:14,350
pubes?

1149
01:35:14,350 --> 01:35:18,640
I haven't seen this video.

1150
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:25,020
Dude I

1151
01:35:25,020 --> 01:35:27,020
don't know. I haven't had a haircut

1152
01:35:27,020 --> 01:35:29,020
yet. Oh man.

1153
01:35:29,020 --> 01:35:31,899
He looks off.

1154
01:35:31,899 --> 01:35:34,460
Maybe you think it's because of this?

1155
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:36,460
Do you think it has anything to do with

1156
01:35:36,460 --> 01:35:38,460
whatever this is right now?

1157
01:35:38,460 --> 01:35:40,460
Do you think it has anything to do with how off I look

1158
01:35:40,460 --> 01:35:42,699
today? I wonder if you think it

1159
01:35:42,699 --> 01:35:51,090
has anything to do with this?

1160
01:35:51,090 --> 01:35:54,859
Pube hair. Okay.

1161
01:35:54,859 --> 01:35:58,319
Look. Before I open this.

1162
01:35:58,319 --> 01:36:00,880
I'm 37.

1163
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:03,699
You get older. Your hair gets a little

1164
01:36:03,699 --> 01:36:05,699
scraggly. It gets a little weird. But

1165
01:36:05,699 --> 01:36:07,699
it's still there. I still have

1166
01:36:07,699 --> 01:36:09,699
it all. I know people that

1167
01:36:09,699 --> 01:36:11,699
are way younger than me.

1168
01:36:11,699 --> 01:36:13,699
And some that are way older than me.

1169
01:36:13,699 --> 01:36:15,699
That do not have this.

1170
01:36:15,699 --> 01:36:17,699
Oh look at your hairline. Look at that.

1171
01:36:17,699 --> 01:36:19,699
Oh wow. Oh yeah. You'll see.

1172
01:36:19,699 --> 01:36:21,699
When you're almost 40 you come talk to me. How does that

1173
01:36:21,699 --> 01:36:23,699
sound? When you're almost 40 you come talk to me.

1174
01:36:23,699 --> 01:36:25,699
The winner.

1175
01:36:25,699 --> 01:36:27,699
Of worst hair.

1176
01:36:27,699 --> 01:36:29,699
Of the year is.

1177
01:36:32,899 --> 01:36:35,520
It was close.

1178
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:37,520
22.1%

1179
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:39,520
of the vote. What do you think it was?

1180
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:41,949
Chad, what do you think?

1181
01:36:41,949 --> 01:36:49,229
Let me see. Off Andy?

1182
01:36:49,229 --> 01:36:51,229
Off? He looks off? No.

1183
01:36:51,229 --> 01:36:54,750
Not even close. The winner is

1184
01:36:54,750 --> 01:36:56,750
pubesideburns at 22%

1185
01:36:56,750 --> 01:36:58,750
of that. Okay.

1186
01:36:58,750 --> 01:37:00,750
Greasy cooked hair at

1187
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:02,750
19%. And then

1188
01:37:02,750 --> 01:37:04,750
shaggy hair gets a

1189
01:37:04,750 --> 01:37:06,750
chat member banned

1190
01:37:06,750 --> 01:37:08,750
at 11.7% of the vote.

1191
01:37:08,750 --> 01:37:10,750
So pubesideburns.

1192
01:37:10,750 --> 01:37:12,750
Pubesideburns wins.

1193
01:37:12,750 --> 01:37:14,750
Alright. The next one.

1194
01:37:14,750 --> 01:37:16,750
How does this sound?

1195
01:37:16,750 --> 01:37:18,989
Let's get to best dancing.

1196
01:37:18,989 --> 01:37:21,229
Which there were some

1197
01:37:21,229 --> 01:37:23,229
I did a lot of good dancing this year.

1198
01:37:23,229 --> 01:37:25,229
I'm going to open it but I'm not going to look at it yet.

1199
01:37:25,229 --> 01:37:27,229
I'm not going to look at it yet.

1200
01:37:27,229 --> 01:37:29,229
I just want to get it ready. So you don't

1201
01:37:29,229 --> 01:37:31,729
hear the sound effects.

1202
01:37:31,729 --> 01:37:33,729
At best dancing, I know I've hit the

1203
01:37:33,729 --> 01:37:35,729
Luddy a few good times this year.

1204
01:37:35,729 --> 01:37:37,729
I know I did the orangutan, which

1205
01:37:37,729 --> 01:37:39,729
didn't even get nominated. So what the heck's going on

1206
01:37:39,729 --> 01:37:41,729
there, guys? Thanks a lot.

1207
01:37:41,729 --> 01:37:43,729
That's my dance. The orangutan.

1208
01:37:43,729 --> 01:37:45,729
Doesn't even get nominated.

1209
01:37:45,729 --> 01:37:49,060
The hacker wants to

1210
01:37:49,060 --> 01:37:52,579
1v1 you.

1211
01:37:52,579 --> 01:37:54,579
I don't know what that means.

1212
01:37:54,579 --> 01:37:56,579
We'll figure that out when we get back.

1213
01:37:56,579 --> 01:37:58,579
But here are your nominees for best dancing of the

1214
01:37:58,579 --> 01:38:00,579
year. Here are your nominees.

1215
01:38:00,579 --> 01:38:09,279
Right now.

1216
01:38:09,279 --> 01:38:11,279
Somebody said hit the Luddy. All right. How do you do it?

1217
01:38:20,739 --> 01:38:22,739
How's that?

1218
01:38:22,739 --> 01:38:24,739
I'm an actor. I act

1219
01:38:24,739 --> 01:38:32,100
for a living.

1220
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:34,100
Can you fucking trick that?

1221
01:38:34,100 --> 01:38:46,510
Go for it.

1222
01:38:46,510 --> 01:38:52,449
It's all right.

1223
01:38:52,449 --> 01:39:17,859
Feed him to the lions.

1224
01:39:17,859 --> 01:39:21,119
Yeah, feed him.

1225
01:39:21,119 --> 01:39:23,119
Feed him to the lions. Don't you think?

1226
01:39:23,119 --> 01:39:31,890
I don't know how to twerk.

1227
01:39:31,890 --> 01:39:35,149
You can't resident sleep for this, can you?

1228
01:39:35,149 --> 01:39:38,220
Fucking jokers.

1229
01:39:38,220 --> 01:39:53,500
Tay, can you twerk? Yeah.

1230
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:55,500
You think you can beat me? I know I can beat you.

1231
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:57,500
I don't know what I'm going to beat you at. Oh, you know you can beat me.

1232
01:39:57,500 --> 01:39:59,500
Go ahead and cue the music.

1233
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:01,500
Good luck.

1234
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:04,640
Weird monopoly man.

1235
01:40:04,640 --> 01:40:10,909
Swedish monopoly man.

1236
01:40:10,909 --> 01:40:12,909
What is planned?

1237
01:40:12,909 --> 01:40:17,840
You guys synchronized this?

1238
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:19,840
How are you doing it so well saved?

1239
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:21,840
Nobody beats me at my own game. This is incredible.

1240
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:25,840
These moves.

1241
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:27,840
New German.

1242
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:29,840
New German.

1243
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:31,840
New German.

1244
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:33,840
Here we go.

1245
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:35,840
He had moves the whole time.

1246
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:37,840
One handed.

1247
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:39,840
New German.

1248
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:41,840
Did you do the goofy

1249
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:45,939
goober dance?

1250
01:40:45,939 --> 01:40:47,939
If it's not Char, then it's me.

1251
01:40:47,939 --> 01:40:49,939
Then vote for me next time.

1252
01:40:49,939 --> 01:40:51,939
Exactly.

1253
01:40:51,939 --> 01:40:53,939
Don't vote for me.

1254
01:40:53,939 --> 01:40:55,939
I didn't do anything.

1255
01:40:55,939 --> 01:40:57,939
But you did.

1256
01:40:57,939 --> 01:41:04,210
So your winner

1257
01:41:04,210 --> 01:41:06,210
for best dancing

1258
01:41:06,210 --> 01:41:10,619
is

1259
01:41:10,619 --> 01:41:16,939
So you think you can beat

1260
01:41:16,939 --> 01:41:18,939
me at 21%

1261
01:41:18,939 --> 01:41:20,939
of the vote? Very close.

1262
01:41:20,939 --> 01:41:23,119
Hit the Luddie

1263
01:41:23,119 --> 01:41:25,119
was 20.2%.

1264
01:41:25,119 --> 01:41:27,119
It was literally 1% difference.

1265
01:41:27,119 --> 01:41:29,739
And then twerking king

1266
01:41:29,739 --> 01:41:31,739
was 17%. But hit the Luddie

1267
01:41:31,739 --> 01:41:33,739
and think you can beat me.

1268
01:41:33,739 --> 01:41:35,739
Very close.

1269
01:41:35,739 --> 01:41:37,739
I was on stage. I had a whole suit on.

1270
01:41:37,739 --> 01:41:39,739
Come on.

1271
01:41:39,739 --> 01:41:41,739
This next category, we're going to get right through this.

1272
01:41:41,739 --> 01:41:43,739
I have 1v1.

1273
01:41:43,739 --> 01:41:45,739
I don't know what the fuck he's talking about.

1274
01:41:45,739 --> 01:41:47,739
I wish

1275
01:41:47,739 --> 01:41:49,739
I knew. I have no idea what he wants.

1276
01:41:49,739 --> 01:41:51,739
He's got ownership of that channel

1277
01:41:51,739 --> 01:41:53,739
right now.

1278
01:41:53,739 --> 01:41:55,739
Don't think about it too much.

1279
01:41:55,739 --> 01:41:57,739
Easy.

1280
01:41:57,739 --> 01:41:59,739
During the break I calm down a little bit.

1281
01:41:59,739 --> 01:42:01,739
But it's kind of hard to.

1282
01:42:01,739 --> 01:42:03,739
So this is

1283
01:42:03,739 --> 01:42:05,739
best auto moment.

1284
01:42:05,739 --> 01:42:07,739
And best auto moment is a great

1285
01:42:07,739 --> 01:42:09,739
category considering that I think every

1286
01:42:09,739 --> 01:42:11,739
single nominee on this list

1287
01:42:11,739 --> 01:42:13,739
were the only times auto was shown on screen.

1288
01:42:13,739 --> 01:42:15,739
I think it's five times

1289
01:42:15,739 --> 01:42:17,739
or six times over the year. So there's six

1290
01:42:17,739 --> 01:42:19,739
nominees. And here they are.

1291
01:42:19,739 --> 01:42:21,739
For best auto moment.

1292
01:42:21,739 --> 01:42:34,720
Auto.

1293
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:39,779
You seem like we've had turkey now.

1294
01:42:39,779 --> 01:42:44,189
He was very sleepy.

1295
01:42:44,189 --> 01:42:48,909
Are you tired? Maybe it's a good idea

1296
01:42:48,909 --> 01:42:50,909
to just turn the VPN on. And have it just kind of

1297
01:42:50,909 --> 01:42:52,909
go somewhere else and have the traffic

1298
01:42:52,909 --> 01:43:02,699
come in a circle.

1299
01:43:02,699 --> 01:43:05,260
He knows there's a treat. He's right here.

1300
01:43:05,260 --> 01:43:07,569
God, he needs to lose some weight.

1301
01:43:07,569 --> 01:43:09,869
Say hello, Akio.

1302
01:43:09,869 --> 01:43:12,300
He's so chunky.

1303
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:14,859
He needs to lose at least

1304
01:43:14,859 --> 01:43:17,170
a pound or two.

1305
01:43:17,170 --> 01:43:23,949
He's very chunky.

1306
01:43:23,949 --> 01:43:26,579
He's snoring.

1307
01:43:26,579 --> 01:43:28,579
He's doing that like

1308
01:43:28,579 --> 01:43:30,939
He's like dreaming and snoring at the same time.

1309
01:43:30,939 --> 01:43:36,260
Yes, he has two beds.

1310
01:43:36,260 --> 01:43:38,260
He's like Snoopy. He doesn't like that one.

1311
01:43:38,260 --> 01:43:40,939
How do I really feel?

1312
01:43:40,939 --> 01:43:43,250
He's a C.

1313
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:46,369
He went from F to C.

1314
01:43:46,369 --> 01:43:51,170
There's a little too buttery at the end.

1315
01:43:51,170 --> 01:43:53,409
Oh, it's over Cantaloupe for sure.

1316
01:43:53,409 --> 01:43:55,409
It's over Pepsi for sure.

1317
01:43:55,409 --> 01:43:59,310
The same stream.

1318
01:43:59,310 --> 01:44:06,670
It's just in the corner.

1319
01:44:06,670 --> 01:44:16,210
I mean, they all win.

1320
01:44:16,210 --> 01:44:18,210
It's every single one wins.

1321
01:44:18,210 --> 01:44:20,210
There's no winner for best auto

1322
01:44:20,210 --> 01:44:22,210
moment. It's just anytime he's on

1323
01:44:22,210 --> 01:44:24,380
camera, it's fun.

1324
01:44:24,380 --> 01:44:26,380
It's best. Do we need to even

1325
01:44:26,380 --> 01:44:28,380
declare a winner? Can they all win?

1326
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:30,380
They all win, I think.

1327
01:44:30,380 --> 01:44:32,380
But wow.

1328
01:44:32,380 --> 01:44:34,380
Whoa, actually, this is crazy.

1329
01:44:34,380 --> 01:44:36,380
Best auto moment of the year is

1330
01:44:36,380 --> 01:44:39,199
at 48%

1331
01:44:39,199 --> 01:44:41,199
of the vote.

1332
01:44:41,199 --> 01:44:43,199
Sleepy auto in

1333
01:44:43,199 --> 01:44:45,630
Jerma's arms. And then at

1334
01:44:45,630 --> 01:44:47,630
19% snoring in the cheaper

1335
01:44:47,630 --> 01:44:49,630
bed. And then 11%

1336
01:44:49,630 --> 01:44:51,630
is auto is a little chunky.

1337
01:44:51,630 --> 01:44:53,630
It always gets chunky.

1338
01:44:53,630 --> 01:44:55,630
What? Who is talking in my ear?

1339
01:44:55,630 --> 01:44:57,630
Who's what?

1340
01:44:57,630 --> 01:44:59,869
Hello, Jerma.

1341
01:44:59,869 --> 01:45:01,869
What's up, dude? I've got

1342
01:45:01,869 --> 01:45:03,869
a proposal for you.

1343
01:45:03,869 --> 01:45:05,869
I've already heard about it. People have been coming

1344
01:45:05,869 --> 01:45:07,869
over here. How's your stream

1345
01:45:07,869 --> 01:45:09,869
going, by the way? My stream?

1346
01:45:09,869 --> 01:45:11,869
Yeah. How's your stream going? It's going

1347
01:45:11,869 --> 01:45:14,109
great. It's going great.

1348
01:45:14,109 --> 01:45:16,109
How's the Call of Duty

1349
01:45:16,109 --> 01:45:18,109
campaign? How's that going?

1350
01:45:18,109 --> 01:45:20,109
You get through the first part yet? People love it.

1351
01:45:20,109 --> 01:45:22,109
I'm on the second level.

1352
01:45:22,109 --> 01:45:24,109
It's, it's, I'm quite good.

1353
01:45:24,109 --> 01:45:26,109
People are asking for hot tips

1354
01:45:26,109 --> 01:45:28,109
and I've been giving them out.

1355
01:45:28,109 --> 01:45:30,109
Okay. So, and what

1356
01:45:30,109 --> 01:45:32,109
can I do for you? I've heard this, oh, there's a 1v1

1357
01:45:32,109 --> 01:45:34,109
scenario that we're going to do. Yes, well, do you want

1358
01:45:34,109 --> 01:45:36,109
your stream back or not? I'm feeling Christmasy.

1359
01:45:36,109 --> 01:45:38,109
Yep.

1360
01:45:38,109 --> 01:45:40,109
I'm feeling, I'm feeling in the

1361
01:45:40,109 --> 01:45:42,479
mood. And you're feeling

1362
01:45:42,479 --> 01:45:44,479
in the mood for what, exactly? You want a 1v1

1363
01:45:44,479 --> 01:45:46,479
me and Call of Duty and I destroy you and I get

1364
01:45:46,479 --> 01:45:48,479
the channel back. Is that what it is? That's right.

1365
01:45:48,479 --> 01:45:50,479
That's your proposal? That's the proposal.

1366
01:45:50,479 --> 01:45:52,479
Yes.

1367
01:45:52,479 --> 01:45:54,479
So, let me, let me, let me just like make sure I break this down

1368
01:45:54,479 --> 01:45:56,479
completely. If I

1369
01:45:56,479 --> 01:45:58,479
beat you in a 1v1 in Call of Duty.

1370
01:45:58,479 --> 01:46:00,479
That's right. You will give me

1371
01:46:00,479 --> 01:46:02,479
the channel back. That's right.

1372
01:46:02,479 --> 01:46:04,479
No bullshit. I've set up the

1373
01:46:04,479 --> 01:46:06,479
lobby and everything. First to five,

1374
01:46:06,479 --> 01:46:08,479
best of three. First to five, best of three.

1375
01:46:08,479 --> 01:46:10,479
And you're not messing around or anything. This is for real.

1376
01:46:10,479 --> 01:46:12,479
Oh, no, no. I wouldn't lie to you,

1377
01:46:12,479 --> 01:46:14,479
Jerma. Is he lying? I don't lie.

1378
01:46:14,479 --> 01:46:16,479
You lie.

1379
01:46:16,479 --> 01:46:18,479
Do you, do you have me over, do, do, do,

1380
01:46:18,479 --> 01:46:20,479
do you get the information from him?

1381
01:46:20,479 --> 01:46:24,899
You should have it. Do you have it?

1382
01:46:24,899 --> 01:46:26,899
Yeah. Well, I, so, so if I win, I get the

1383
01:46:26,899 --> 01:46:28,899
channel back. If you win,

1384
01:46:28,899 --> 01:46:30,899
you get the channel back. Let's fucking go. Let's go

1385
01:46:30,899 --> 01:46:32,899
then. Let's go. I, I need

1386
01:46:32,899 --> 01:46:34,899
some, I need some support back here, please.

1387
01:46:34,899 --> 01:46:36,899
What do you need?

1388
01:46:36,899 --> 01:46:38,899
I need, excuse me,

1389
01:46:38,899 --> 01:46:40,899
I need a little bit of support here.

1390
01:46:40,899 --> 01:46:42,899
I don't know anything about Call of Duty. Time to focus up.

1391
01:46:42,899 --> 01:46:44,899
Thanks, thanks. Time to focus up. Look alive. Open your mouth.

1392
01:46:44,899 --> 01:46:46,899
Open your mouth. What is this, a team?

1393
01:46:46,899 --> 01:46:48,899
What are we,

1394
01:46:48,899 --> 01:46:50,899
boxing? Focus up. You're supposed to do it

1395
01:46:50,899 --> 01:46:52,899
very gently. We've done bro versus bro.

1396
01:46:52,899 --> 01:46:54,899
We know you're not the best gamer. You're going to have to focus.

1397
01:46:54,899 --> 01:46:56,899
Stop, stop, stop. Boxer dropped out. We need this.

1398
01:46:56,899 --> 01:46:58,899
Listen, listen to me. We need this. Quiet.

1399
01:46:58,899 --> 01:47:00,899
Quiet.

1400
01:47:00,899 --> 01:47:02,899
What's the loadout, what's the best loadout

1401
01:47:02,899 --> 01:47:04,899
in Call of Duty Modern Warfare? Can you get him off the fucking screen

1402
01:47:04,899 --> 01:47:06,899
before I puke? What is that?

1403
01:47:06,899 --> 01:47:08,899
Oh, thank you. I appreciate that. I think your play

1404
01:47:08,899 --> 01:47:10,899
style's a run and gun. Did you just put make-up

1405
01:47:10,899 --> 01:47:12,899
on me? What, submachine gun? What did you just do?

1406
01:47:12,899 --> 01:47:14,899
War paint. Did you just put war paint on?

1407
01:47:14,899 --> 01:47:16,899
War paint. This is going to be off for the rest of the

1408
01:47:16,899 --> 01:47:18,899
day now. What the hell?

1409
01:47:18,899 --> 01:47:20,899
You're ready. Just believe in yourself.

1410
01:47:20,899 --> 01:47:22,899
What's worse, having paint on your face

1411
01:47:22,899 --> 01:47:24,899
for the rest of the day or having him on your channel for the rest of the day?

1412
01:47:24,899 --> 01:47:26,899
Think about that. Come on.

1413
01:47:26,899 --> 01:47:28,899
Do or die. Hey, are you a fan

1414
01:47:28,899 --> 01:47:31,779
of Lugwig? Variety

1415
01:47:31,779 --> 01:47:33,779
streamer. Do you know Lugwig at all?

1416
01:47:33,779 --> 01:47:35,779
Hello? Do you know Atreyok at all?

1417
01:47:35,779 --> 01:47:37,779
Oh, you're talking to me. I'm sorry,

1418
01:47:37,779 --> 01:47:39,779
I'm setting up the game for you because you don't know how to play.

1419
01:47:39,779 --> 01:47:41,779
Alright, alright, alright. It's time.

1420
01:47:41,779 --> 01:47:43,779
Am I ready?

1421
01:47:43,779 --> 01:47:45,779
1 v 1, I get the channel back.

1422
01:47:45,779 --> 01:47:47,779
Alright, so first to five.

1423
01:47:47,779 --> 01:47:49,779
I'll put a ten minute limit on it. Can I get everybody

1424
01:47:49,779 --> 01:47:51,779
in here, please? I need

1425
01:47:51,779 --> 01:47:53,779
support, I need to be taught how to do this shit.

1426
01:47:53,779 --> 01:47:55,779
Tighten up, tighten up.

1427
01:47:57,779 --> 01:47:59,779
What's your class? What's your class?

1428
01:47:59,779 --> 01:48:01,779
I don't know what class means, Lugwig. Submachine gun.

1429
01:48:01,779 --> 01:48:03,779
Long, light machine gun.

1430
01:48:03,779 --> 01:48:05,779
Machine gun. I don't know what

1431
01:48:05,779 --> 01:48:07,779
any of this means.

1432
01:48:07,779 --> 01:48:09,779
Am I in the lobby?

1433
01:48:09,779 --> 01:48:11,779
Just focus, don't worry about it yet.

1434
01:48:11,779 --> 01:48:13,779
Why is Lugwig going to buy stuff in the stores?

1435
01:48:13,779 --> 01:48:15,779
He's buying things. How do I get this off?

1436
01:48:15,779 --> 01:48:17,779
This is going to be on all day. Look, it comes off easy.

1437
01:48:17,779 --> 01:48:22,640
It'll come off, it'll come off.

1438
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:24,640
Did I get an invite?

1439
01:48:24,640 --> 01:48:26,640
Why are you buying the skin?

1440
01:48:26,640 --> 01:48:28,640
I was buying the bundle.

1441
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:30,640
Who the fuck are you?

1442
01:48:30,640 --> 01:48:32,640
I'm the engineer. Oh, you were sitting here, sorry.

1443
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:34,640
Extinguisher, that's gotta be...

1444
01:48:34,640 --> 01:48:36,640
Come on, come on, come on.

1445
01:48:38,640 --> 01:48:40,640
Can somebody get me a snack, please?

1446
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:42,640
Alright.

1447
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:44,640
Snacks!

1448
01:48:44,640 --> 01:48:46,640
Snacks! Snacks!

1449
01:48:46,640 --> 01:48:48,640
Snacks! Snacks! Snacks!

1450
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:50,640
I don't want that.

1451
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:52,640
I don't want that either.

1452
01:48:52,640 --> 01:48:54,640
You want me to chew it up?

1453
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:56,640
I can chew it up for you.

1454
01:48:56,640 --> 01:48:58,640
Do you need water?

1455
01:48:58,640 --> 01:49:00,640
Okay, Jeremy, you get yourself a little juice box.

1456
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:02,640
You get yourself some face paint.

1457
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:04,640
Alright, go, go, go!

1458
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:06,640
Everyone, I want to start a chant.

1459
01:49:06,640 --> 01:49:08,640
Are you ready?

1460
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:10,640
Let's get this motherfucker!

1461
01:49:10,640 --> 01:49:12,640
Let's get this motherfucker!

1462
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:14,640
Let's get this motherfucker!

1463
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:16,640
Let's get this motherfucker!

1464
01:49:16,640 --> 01:49:18,640
Let's get this motherfucker!

1465
01:49:18,640 --> 01:49:24,270
Are you sure you're ready, Jeremy?

1466
01:49:24,270 --> 01:49:26,270
Go.

1467
01:49:26,270 --> 01:49:28,270
Your whole existence is on the line right now.

1468
01:49:28,270 --> 01:49:30,270
This engineer was on Facebook

1469
01:49:30,270 --> 01:49:32,270
for like the last probably hour.

1470
01:49:32,270 --> 01:49:34,270
Who have you been writing to on here?

1471
01:49:34,270 --> 01:49:36,270
Still one of the most popular websites in Europe

1472
01:49:36,270 --> 01:49:38,270
for like social media.

1473
01:49:38,270 --> 01:49:40,270
Alright, you ready? Let's go.

1474
01:49:40,270 --> 01:49:42,270
Let's go, extinguisher.

1475
01:49:42,270 --> 01:49:44,270
You're the extinguisher?

1476
01:49:44,270 --> 01:49:46,270
What is this? Nutri-grain bar?

1477
01:49:46,270 --> 01:49:48,270
What is this thing?

1478
01:49:48,270 --> 01:49:51,789
Fuel.

1479
01:49:51,789 --> 01:49:54,670
No.

1480
01:49:54,670 --> 01:49:56,670
Where are you running to, my friend?

1481
01:49:56,670 --> 01:49:59,229
Okay.

1482
01:49:59,229 --> 01:50:01,229
It's just waiting for host. Are you the host?

1483
01:50:01,229 --> 01:50:03,229
Yes, I'm the host.

1484
01:50:03,229 --> 01:50:05,229
You have to make the call.

1485
01:50:05,229 --> 01:50:07,229
Oh, I gotta send you another invite

1486
01:50:07,229 --> 01:50:09,229
because you don't know how to play.

1487
01:50:09,229 --> 01:50:11,229
I'm in the lobby right now, extinguisher!

1488
01:50:11,229 --> 01:50:13,229
Will you booty me?

1489
01:50:13,229 --> 01:50:15,229
You know what?

1490
01:50:15,229 --> 01:50:17,229
You start the back out of the lobby, invite him.

1491
01:50:17,229 --> 01:50:19,229
What the fuck? Invite him, fight on your turf.

1492
01:50:19,229 --> 01:50:21,229
And fight on my turf?

1493
01:50:21,229 --> 01:50:23,229
I'll play on your turf.

1494
01:50:23,229 --> 01:50:25,659
It doesn't matter the turf.

1495
01:50:25,659 --> 01:50:27,659
Not a lot of friends going on here.

1496
01:50:27,659 --> 01:50:29,659
Right there, that's him.

1497
01:50:29,659 --> 01:50:31,659
Where do I go from here? Join game?

1498
01:50:31,659 --> 01:50:33,659
Yeah, sure, join his game, fuck it.

1499
01:50:33,659 --> 01:50:35,659
Hey, what do you think about that? Are we ready?

1500
01:50:35,659 --> 01:50:37,659
I just backed out of the game.

1501
01:50:37,659 --> 01:50:39,659
Who are these people?

1502
01:50:39,659 --> 01:50:41,659
Get out of that lobby!

1503
01:50:41,659 --> 01:50:43,659
Who are these people?

1504
01:50:43,659 --> 01:50:45,659
Invite him, invite him.

1505
01:50:45,659 --> 01:50:47,659
I see, I see, I'm joining your lobby.

1506
01:50:47,659 --> 01:50:49,659
Yeah, but I think he's in a lobby with a bunch of people.

1507
01:50:49,659 --> 01:50:51,659
Let's go!

1508
01:50:51,659 --> 01:50:53,659
Here we go.

1509
01:50:53,659 --> 01:50:55,659
Come on, Jarrah.

1510
01:50:55,659 --> 01:50:57,659
There's people in here.

1511
01:50:57,659 --> 01:50:59,659
Who are these people?

1512
01:50:59,659 --> 01:51:01,659
I think he's just in a regular lobby, he's in a free-for-all.

1513
01:51:01,659 --> 01:51:03,659
He's in a private lobby.

1514
01:51:03,659 --> 01:51:05,659
Who's in a private lobby?

1515
01:51:05,659 --> 01:51:07,659
How are the random people?

1516
01:51:07,659 --> 01:51:09,659
How do these people get in the lobby?

1517
01:51:09,659 --> 01:51:11,659
Moist bagel.

1518
01:51:11,659 --> 01:51:13,659
A friend-wisher doesn't even know how these people get in.

1519
01:51:13,659 --> 01:51:15,659
A friend request?

1520
01:51:15,659 --> 01:51:17,659
No, we're not doing that.

1521
01:51:17,659 --> 01:51:19,659
I need somebody from production to help me.

1522
01:51:19,659 --> 01:51:21,659
Oh god, it's going.

1523
01:51:21,659 --> 01:51:23,659
Let's see.

1524
01:51:23,659 --> 01:51:25,659
What happened?

1525
01:51:25,659 --> 01:51:27,659
You gotta set up a private body, maybe a customized one.

1526
01:51:27,659 --> 01:51:29,659
Invite him to your party.

1527
01:51:29,659 --> 01:51:31,659
It says you're in the main menu.

1528
01:51:31,659 --> 01:51:33,659
You're supposed to be a hacker.

1529
01:51:33,659 --> 01:51:35,659
And a free-for-all.

1530
01:51:35,659 --> 01:51:37,659
He's good at hacking, not Call of Duty.

1531
01:51:37,659 --> 01:51:39,659
Invite him to the party here.

1532
01:51:39,659 --> 01:51:41,659
It was one of you two.

1533
01:51:41,659 --> 01:51:43,659
I sent you in a DM.

1534
01:51:43,659 --> 01:51:45,659
I don't know who we did.

1535
01:51:45,659 --> 01:51:47,659
You are the one who's supposed to give it to production.

1536
01:51:47,659 --> 01:51:49,659
Let me tell you right now, don't ever ask me for a stream key in a DM.

1537
01:51:49,659 --> 01:51:51,659
That's actually stupid.

1538
01:51:51,659 --> 01:51:53,659
And I don't know why I listen to you.

1539
01:51:53,659 --> 01:51:55,659
Well, that's true.

1540
01:51:55,659 --> 01:51:57,659
It goes two ways.

1541
01:51:57,659 --> 01:51:59,659
We love it.

1542
01:51:59,659 --> 01:52:01,659
We love you.

1543
01:52:01,659 --> 01:52:03,659
Good news, he's in our lobby.

1544
01:52:03,659 --> 01:52:05,659
Good news.

1545
01:52:05,659 --> 01:52:07,659
Good news, everyone.

1546
01:52:07,659 --> 01:52:09,659
Let's win this, Turma.

1547
01:52:09,659 --> 01:52:11,659
I am still just thinking about how much I want to strangle you.

1548
01:52:11,659 --> 01:52:13,659
Right.

1549
01:52:13,659 --> 01:52:15,659
Well, okay.

1550
01:52:15,659 --> 01:52:17,659
You don't mean that.

1551
01:52:17,659 --> 01:52:19,659
We're trying to get a private match.

1552
01:52:19,659 --> 01:52:21,659
Multiplayer, create private match.

1553
01:52:21,659 --> 01:52:23,659
Can they answer this one question?

1554
01:52:23,659 --> 01:52:25,659
Classic.

1555
01:52:25,659 --> 01:52:27,659
He wants to ask you guys a question.

1556
01:52:27,659 --> 01:52:29,659
Is his face as red as his hair right now?

1557
01:52:29,659 --> 01:52:31,659
What's a good one? Knockout?

1558
01:52:31,659 --> 01:52:33,659
We want to go free-for-all.

1559
01:52:33,659 --> 01:52:35,659
Free-for-all.

1560
01:52:35,659 --> 01:52:37,659
Finally.

1561
01:52:37,659 --> 01:52:39,659
I mean, the hacker, seriously, I thought you could set this whole thing up.

1562
01:52:39,659 --> 01:52:41,659
Locked.

1563
01:52:41,659 --> 01:52:43,659
You've got a whole team of people.

1564
01:52:43,659 --> 01:52:45,659
Yeah, where's yours, by the way?

1565
01:52:45,659 --> 01:52:47,659
Where are all your team of friends?

1566
01:52:47,659 --> 01:52:49,659
Our friendship, our Christmas.

1567
01:52:49,659 --> 01:52:51,659
Right here.

1568
01:52:51,659 --> 01:52:53,659
Are we going?

1569
01:52:53,659 --> 01:52:55,659
Focus up, focus up, focus up.

1570
01:52:55,659 --> 01:52:57,659
More water, more water.

1571
01:52:57,659 --> 01:52:59,659
You keep spilling.

1572
01:52:59,659 --> 01:53:01,659
You keep aiming wrong.

1573
01:53:01,659 --> 01:53:03,659
Is this a good loadout?

1574
01:53:03,659 --> 01:53:05,659
Yeah, it's a submachine gun.

1575
01:53:05,659 --> 01:53:07,659
It's a run-and-gun, run-and-gun.

1576
01:53:07,659 --> 01:53:09,659
Keep on your toes.

1577
01:53:09,659 --> 01:53:11,659
Headshots or what?

1578
01:53:11,659 --> 01:53:13,659
You're not wearing a headset.

1579
01:53:13,659 --> 01:53:15,659
Headshots or what?

1580
01:53:15,659 --> 01:53:17,659
Hit him in the body.

1581
01:53:17,659 --> 01:53:19,659
Yeah, let's go.

1582
01:53:19,659 --> 01:53:21,659
What are you doing?

1583
01:53:21,659 --> 01:53:23,659
It's fine, it's fine.

1584
01:53:23,659 --> 01:53:25,659
Come on, Jermall, let's go.

1585
01:53:25,659 --> 01:53:27,659
We need the channel back.

1586
01:53:27,659 --> 01:53:29,659
Tighten up, tighten up.

1587
01:53:29,659 --> 01:53:31,659
We got PepsiCo on the phone.

1588
01:53:31,659 --> 01:53:33,659
We got everybody screaming at us.

1589
01:53:33,659 --> 01:53:35,659
There we go, that's one, Jermma.

1590
01:53:35,659 --> 01:53:37,659
Yeah, I can count.

1591
01:53:37,659 --> 01:53:39,659
Aiming a little low.

1592
01:53:39,659 --> 01:53:41,659
Where are you?

1593
01:53:41,659 --> 01:53:43,659
Keep the energy on him.

1594
01:53:43,659 --> 01:53:45,659
Are you camping?

1595
01:53:45,659 --> 01:53:47,659
He can hear you.

1596
01:53:47,659 --> 01:53:49,659
Because I need my fucking channel.

1597
01:53:49,659 --> 01:53:51,659
It's just Lane.

1598
01:53:51,659 --> 01:53:53,659
Are you Lane?

1599
01:53:53,659 --> 01:53:55,659
Now he can hear us and you fuck it up.

1600
01:53:55,659 --> 01:53:57,659
I see you, Jermma.

1601
01:53:57,659 --> 01:53:59,659
I see you.

1602
01:53:59,659 --> 01:54:01,659
This is really cool.

1603
01:54:01,659 --> 01:54:03,659
I'm not on his side.

1604
01:54:03,659 --> 01:54:07,760
Come on, come on.

1605
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:10,449
He's made things interesting.

1606
01:54:10,449 --> 01:54:12,449
Focus, focus.

1607
01:54:12,449 --> 01:54:14,449
He's made things interesting.

1608
01:54:14,449 --> 01:54:16,449
Iron, but get steel, baby.

1609
01:54:16,449 --> 01:54:18,449
I've always said that.

1610
01:54:18,449 --> 01:54:20,449
Your butt looks nice in those pants.

1611
01:54:20,449 --> 01:54:22,449
I don't know that thing.

1612
01:54:22,449 --> 01:54:24,449
Is this a bad idea?

1613
01:54:24,449 --> 01:54:26,449
You're lying down in the middle of the same spot.

1614
01:54:26,449 --> 01:54:28,449
There's a lot of openings.

1615
01:54:28,449 --> 01:54:30,449
There's a lot of openings.

1616
01:54:30,449 --> 01:54:32,449
Reduce the amount of entries he could see.

1617
01:54:32,449 --> 01:54:34,449
This might fuck him up.

1618
01:54:41,630 --> 01:54:43,630
Thank you so much, Ludwig.

1619
01:54:43,630 --> 01:54:45,630
Are you going to lay down the whole time?

1620
01:54:45,630 --> 01:54:47,630
I'm not going to lay down the whole time.

1621
01:54:47,630 --> 01:54:49,630
Let's go ahead and pound it right there.

1622
01:54:49,630 --> 01:54:51,630
You're not going to lay down again?

1623
01:54:51,630 --> 01:54:53,630
No, not anymore.

1624
01:54:53,630 --> 01:54:55,630
Running gun. Head shot.

1625
01:54:55,630 --> 01:54:59,920
Walk around a corner.

1626
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:01,920
Go around a corner?

1627
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:03,920
Look at you.

1628
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:05,920
I don't know where the hell he is.

1629
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:07,920
You have to go around corners safely.

1630
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:09,920
Ludwig, I don't think you understand

1631
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:11,920
that this guy's on my channel right now.

1632
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:13,920
You don't understand if you fucking lose this game

1633
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:15,920
you don't get your channel back.

1634
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:19,920
I'm thinking of calling the channel The Extinguisher.

1635
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:23,920
Twitch is not going to let you change my name to The Extinguisher.

1636
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:25,920
I'm going to change it to The Extinguisher 986.

1637
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:27,920
He's actually pulling a lot of numbers.

1638
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:29,920
I've actually seen his viewership.

1639
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:31,920
It went up since you were off.

1640
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:33,920
How many viewers does he have on that channel?

1641
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:35,920
He's got like 50,000.

1642
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:37,920
400 million.

1643
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:39,920
How many people are actually on that channel?

1644
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:41,920
He's like a 30, 40K.

1645
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:43,920
He's big. I actually asked if he was through an operating room.

1646
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:50,460
That's it.

1647
01:55:50,460 --> 01:55:52,460
It's the first of five.

1648
01:55:52,460 --> 01:55:54,460
You're hitting me a little hard.

1649
01:55:54,460 --> 01:55:56,460
It is a flaw you have.

1650
01:55:56,460 --> 01:55:58,460
He does it a lot.

1651
01:55:58,460 --> 01:56:00,460
Wow.

1652
01:56:00,460 --> 01:56:02,460
First of five kills.

1653
01:56:02,460 --> 01:56:04,460
Two rounds. Three rounds.

1654
01:56:04,460 --> 01:56:06,460
Tighten up. Two more kills.

1655
01:56:06,460 --> 01:56:08,460
Maybe reload.

1656
01:56:08,460 --> 01:56:10,460
What?

1657
01:56:10,460 --> 01:56:12,460
I thought I automatically did that.

1658
01:56:12,460 --> 01:56:14,460
You're still not reloaded.

1659
01:56:14,460 --> 01:56:16,460
What are you talking about?

1660
01:56:16,460 --> 01:56:18,460
I pressed R.

1661
01:56:18,460 --> 01:56:20,460
What are you doing?

1662
01:56:20,460 --> 01:56:22,460
I'm stuck.

1663
01:56:22,460 --> 01:56:24,960
Okay.

1664
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:28,289
Hey Hacker.

1665
01:56:28,289 --> 01:56:30,289
Hey Extinguisher.

1666
01:56:30,289 --> 01:56:32,289
Are you playing with a controller?

1667
01:56:34,289 --> 01:56:36,289
Uh.

1668
01:56:36,289 --> 01:56:40,260
He's playing with a controller.

1669
01:56:52,260 --> 01:56:54,260
Don't do this when you're talking shit.

1670
01:56:58,260 --> 01:57:00,260
It's first of five.

1671
01:57:00,260 --> 01:57:02,260
Three to three.

1672
01:57:02,260 --> 01:57:04,260
Drop arm.

1673
01:57:04,260 --> 01:57:06,260
You know where he is.

1674
01:57:06,260 --> 01:57:08,260
What are you doing?

1675
01:57:08,260 --> 01:57:10,260
This thing sucks.

1676
01:57:10,260 --> 01:57:12,260
What are you doing on top of that car?

1677
01:57:12,260 --> 01:57:14,260
Tighten up.

1678
01:57:14,260 --> 01:57:16,260
Everybody quiet in the room.

1679
01:57:29,229 --> 01:57:31,659
Shit. I don't want to press the button.

1680
01:57:31,659 --> 01:57:34,420
Get away from the bus, Jerma.

1681
01:57:34,420 --> 01:57:36,420
What? Don't go near the bus?

1682
01:57:36,420 --> 01:57:38,420
Stay away from the bus.

1683
01:57:38,420 --> 01:57:40,590
I'm walking around the bus.

1684
01:57:40,590 --> 01:57:42,590
I should hide under the bus to be able to find

1685
01:57:42,590 --> 01:57:44,590
when he walks by, right?

1686
01:57:44,590 --> 01:57:46,590
You're doing it though.

1687
01:57:46,590 --> 01:57:48,590
You're doing it no matter what we say.

1688
01:57:48,590 --> 01:57:50,590
It doesn't matter.

1689
01:57:50,590 --> 01:57:52,590
Man, if he came from behind

1690
01:57:52,590 --> 01:57:54,590
the bus right now.

1691
01:57:54,590 --> 01:57:56,590
He would kill you.

1692
01:57:56,590 --> 01:57:58,590
Extinguisher.

1693
01:57:58,590 --> 01:58:01,020
Let's bring it home.

1694
01:58:05,020 --> 01:58:07,020
That went down my entire body.

1695
01:58:07,020 --> 01:58:09,020
I need one more kill.

1696
01:58:09,020 --> 01:58:11,020
That's it.

1697
01:58:11,020 --> 01:58:13,020
One more for the channel.

1698
01:58:13,020 --> 01:58:15,020
One more. Come on, baby.

1699
01:58:15,020 --> 01:58:17,020
Are you nervous, Extinguisher?

1700
01:58:17,020 --> 01:58:19,020
The extinguisher is coming for me.

1701
01:58:19,020 --> 01:58:21,020
Is that what you're saying?

1702
01:58:21,020 --> 01:58:23,020
The extinguisher is...

1703
01:58:23,020 --> 01:58:25,020
Oh.

1704
01:58:25,020 --> 01:58:28,289
You fucking idiot.

1705
01:58:28,289 --> 01:58:30,289
Oh.

1706
01:58:30,289 --> 01:58:33,550
Oh.

1707
01:58:33,550 --> 01:58:35,550
Look at that.

1708
01:58:35,550 --> 01:58:37,550
That's your channel.

1709
01:58:37,550 --> 01:58:39,550
That's your channel.

1710
01:58:39,550 --> 01:58:41,550
Best of three. It's not over yet.

1711
01:58:41,550 --> 01:58:43,550
It's actually my channel now, isn't it?

1712
01:58:43,550 --> 01:58:45,550
Oh.

1713
01:58:45,550 --> 01:58:47,550
Yeah, best of three.

1714
01:58:47,550 --> 01:58:49,550
You want two more chances?

1715
01:58:49,550 --> 01:58:51,550
Best of three? You said best of three.

1716
01:58:51,550 --> 01:58:53,550
I did say best of three. I'll give you best of three.

1717
01:58:53,550 --> 01:58:55,550
You said best out of three.

1718
01:58:55,550 --> 01:58:57,550
I did.

1719
01:58:57,550 --> 01:58:59,550
Are you nervous?

1720
01:58:59,550 --> 01:59:01,550
Look at your friends. Your friends are all

1721
01:59:01,550 --> 01:59:03,550
hands on faces.

1722
01:59:03,550 --> 01:59:05,550
They don't look like the Beach Boys anymore.

1723
01:59:05,550 --> 01:59:07,550
They look like the Beach Bums.

1724
01:59:07,550 --> 01:59:09,550
Look at them.

1725
01:59:09,550 --> 01:59:11,550
Go, go, go, go.

1726
01:59:11,550 --> 01:59:13,550
I'm ready. I'm ready.

1727
01:59:13,550 --> 01:59:16,180
I don't know what to do.

1728
01:59:16,180 --> 01:59:18,180
Go, go.

1729
01:59:18,180 --> 01:59:20,180
Wait, wait, wait. Back in.

1730
01:59:20,180 --> 01:59:22,180
You can do this.

1731
01:59:22,180 --> 01:59:24,180
I cannot hear anything you guys are saying, by the way.

1732
01:59:24,180 --> 01:59:26,180
These are noise-canceling headphones.

1733
01:59:26,180 --> 01:59:28,180
Look at him bring behind you.

1734
01:59:28,180 --> 01:59:30,180
They're worried.

1735
01:59:30,180 --> 01:59:32,180
I know.

1736
01:59:32,180 --> 01:59:34,180
Is this a good loadout?

1737
01:59:34,180 --> 01:59:36,180
Yeah. Good.

1738
01:59:36,180 --> 01:59:38,180
You think this is good? Okay.

1739
01:59:38,180 --> 01:59:40,180
Keep it up.

1740
01:59:40,180 --> 01:59:42,180
We could hit him up.

1741
01:59:42,180 --> 01:59:44,180
I think we could

1742
01:59:44,180 --> 01:59:46,180
sign him.

1743
01:59:46,180 --> 01:59:48,180
He's got charisma.

1744
01:59:48,180 --> 01:59:50,180
He's charming.

1745
01:59:50,180 --> 01:59:52,180
I'm walking this way.

1746
01:59:52,180 --> 01:59:54,180
What I like about him is he seems

1747
01:59:54,180 --> 01:59:56,180
like he'll stand by what he promises.

1748
01:59:56,180 --> 01:59:58,180
And I think that's

1749
01:59:58,180 --> 02:00:00,180
what a sponsor wants.

1750
02:00:00,180 --> 02:00:02,180
You got it, baby.

1751
02:00:02,180 --> 02:00:04,180
Keep it up.

1752
02:00:04,180 --> 02:00:06,180
What was that?

1753
02:00:06,180 --> 02:00:08,180
I thought you gave him the finger.

1754
02:00:08,180 --> 02:00:10,180
Hey, Extinguisher.

1755
02:00:10,180 --> 02:00:12,930
Deal with this one, bud.

1756
02:00:12,930 --> 02:00:15,939
Extinguisher.

1757
02:00:15,939 --> 02:00:18,500
Well, I like that you're calling me

1758
02:00:18,500 --> 02:00:20,500
Extinguisher.

1759
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:22,500
Well, I don't know your name. It's the only thing you said.

1760
02:00:22,500 --> 02:00:25,180
You know my name.

1761
02:00:25,180 --> 02:00:27,180
You drained my bank account, too?

1762
02:00:27,180 --> 02:00:29,550
That would be nice.

1763
02:00:29,550 --> 02:00:32,050
Although I've heard you're $2 billion in debt.

1764
02:00:32,050 --> 02:00:34,050
That's fucking bullshit.

1765
02:00:34,050 --> 02:00:36,050
He's got host advantage, probably.

1766
02:00:36,050 --> 02:00:39,380
By the way,

1767
02:00:39,380 --> 02:00:42,579
I can hear every single thing

1768
02:00:42,579 --> 02:00:45,069
you guys say.

1769
02:00:45,069 --> 02:00:48,659
Let's go, Jerma!

1770
02:00:48,659 --> 02:00:50,659
Let's go, Big J!

1771
02:00:50,659 --> 02:00:52,659
Jerma!

1772
02:00:52,659 --> 02:00:56,180
Jerma!

1773
02:00:56,180 --> 02:00:58,180
Jerma!

1774
02:00:58,180 --> 02:01:00,420
Jerma!

1775
02:01:00,420 --> 02:01:02,420
Jerma!

1776
02:01:02,420 --> 02:01:04,420
Jerma!

1777
02:01:04,420 --> 02:01:06,420
You know, he lost someone.

1778
02:01:06,420 --> 02:01:08,420
You fell down.

1779
02:01:08,420 --> 02:01:10,420
I gotta tell you, I love shooting you

1780
02:01:10,420 --> 02:01:12,420
in your cute little butt.

1781
02:01:12,420 --> 02:01:14,420
First to five, you got it, baby.

1782
02:01:14,420 --> 02:01:16,420
Yeah, you are a fucking cod player, aren't you?

1783
02:01:16,420 --> 02:01:18,420
Press Q.

1784
02:01:18,420 --> 02:01:20,420
Q?

1785
02:01:20,420 --> 02:01:22,420
What's that?

1786
02:01:22,420 --> 02:01:24,420
What the hell is...

1787
02:01:24,420 --> 02:01:26,420
Ludwig, what the hell is that?

1788
02:01:26,420 --> 02:01:31,090
E?

1789
02:01:31,090 --> 02:01:33,710
Is this a grenade?

1790
02:01:33,710 --> 02:01:35,710
I think so.

1791
02:01:35,710 --> 02:01:37,710
You think so?

1792
02:01:37,710 --> 02:01:39,710
I don't know.

1793
02:01:39,710 --> 02:01:41,710
I just saw the bottom right.

1794
02:01:41,710 --> 02:01:43,710
But the icon doesn't look like a grenade.

1795
02:01:43,710 --> 02:01:45,710
It could be like a molotov.

1796
02:01:45,710 --> 02:01:47,710
Shh, I hear him!

1797
02:01:47,710 --> 02:01:56,739
Come into the room in the back,

1798
02:01:56,739 --> 02:01:58,739
near the car.

1799
02:01:58,739 --> 02:02:00,739
Hey, Extinguisher, if you come into the room with a guy

1800
02:02:00,739 --> 02:02:02,979
pointing a gun at the camera...

1801
02:02:02,979 --> 02:02:07,069
Son of a goddamn...

1802
02:02:07,069 --> 02:02:09,069
I need to get one kill!

1803
02:02:11,069 --> 02:02:13,069
Come on, come on, come on!

1804
02:02:13,069 --> 02:02:15,069
Come on, baby!

1805
02:02:15,069 --> 02:02:17,069
Are your palms sweaty?

1806
02:02:17,069 --> 02:02:19,069
No, they're actually very dry.

1807
02:02:19,069 --> 02:02:21,069
Thanks for asking, though.

1808
02:02:21,069 --> 02:02:23,949
Is it because you smudged the war paint,

1809
02:02:23,949 --> 02:02:25,949
do you think?

1810
02:02:25,949 --> 02:02:27,949
Could I reapply?

1811
02:02:27,949 --> 02:02:29,949
Get this, put it over there,

1812
02:02:29,949 --> 02:02:31,949
and don't do it again.

1813
02:02:31,949 --> 02:02:33,949
I'm getting fucking forward.

1814
02:02:33,949 --> 02:02:35,949
Come back.

1815
02:02:35,949 --> 02:02:37,949
Come back, season!

1816
02:02:37,949 --> 02:02:39,949
Holiday spirit.

1817
02:02:39,949 --> 02:02:41,949
That's what we need right now.

1818
02:02:41,949 --> 02:02:43,949
Stop touching me,

1819
02:02:43,949 --> 02:02:45,949
so I can focus.

1820
02:02:45,949 --> 02:02:49,220
I am fun!

1821
02:02:49,220 --> 02:02:51,220
I am fun!

1822
02:02:51,220 --> 02:02:53,220
This is so fun!

1823
02:02:53,220 --> 02:02:57,949
Oh, German.

1824
02:02:57,949 --> 02:02:59,949
Oh, German.

1825
02:02:59,949 --> 02:03:01,949
How does it kill from here, right?

1826
02:03:01,949 --> 02:03:03,949
German.

1827
02:03:03,949 --> 02:03:05,949
German.

1828
02:03:05,949 --> 02:03:07,949
Oh.

1829
02:03:07,949 --> 02:03:10,640
Oh.

1830
02:03:10,640 --> 02:03:12,640
Reasonable.

1831
02:03:12,640 --> 02:03:14,640
Welcome to my channel!

1832
02:03:14,640 --> 02:03:18,640
The Extinguisher 986.

1833
02:03:18,640 --> 02:03:20,640
Go to break, just go to the elves.

1834
02:03:20,640 --> 02:03:22,640
Go to the elves.

1835
02:03:22,640 --> 02:07:45,600
What a disaster.

1836
02:07:45,600 --> 02:07:47,600
Do a fun holiday show,

1837
02:07:47,600 --> 02:07:50,159
and at least we still have

1838
02:07:50,159 --> 02:07:52,159
some other stuff to do, but

1839
02:07:52,159 --> 02:07:54,979
it's just so frustrating

1840
02:07:54,979 --> 02:07:56,979
knowing that I'm sitting up there trying to

1841
02:07:56,979 --> 02:07:58,979
just keep it together and do the awards,

1842
02:07:58,979 --> 02:08:02,180
and this extinguisher,

1843
02:08:02,180 --> 02:08:04,180
I kind of don't know what to do.

1844
02:08:04,180 --> 02:08:06,859
I could have been doing more awards if I needed to,

1845
02:08:06,859 --> 02:08:09,300
but it's just so fucking annoying.

1846
02:08:09,300 --> 02:08:11,300
I'm sorry, everybody, that you're supposed to be like,

1847
02:08:11,300 --> 02:08:14,109
Merry Christmas, happy holidays.

1848
02:08:14,109 --> 02:08:17,819
What is that?

1849
02:08:17,819 --> 02:08:19,819
No, no, he can't do it.

1850
02:08:19,819 --> 02:08:22,130
No, no, no, stop that, stop that.

1851
02:08:22,130 --> 02:08:24,130
Can you get me into it? Pump me in, pump me in.

1852
02:08:24,130 --> 02:08:26,130
Does he know?

1853
02:08:26,130 --> 02:08:29,329
I don't think he knows.

1854
02:08:29,329 --> 02:08:35,069
Oh, God.

1855
02:08:35,069 --> 02:08:37,069
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome

1856
02:08:37,069 --> 02:08:39,069
to Bugleberry's cooking segment.

1857
02:08:39,069 --> 02:08:41,069
Bugleberry, you can't, can you hear me?

1858
02:08:41,069 --> 02:08:43,069
What?

1859
02:08:43,069 --> 02:08:45,069
You can't do the segment right now.

1860
02:08:45,069 --> 02:08:47,069
We've got a situation here.

1861
02:08:47,069 --> 02:08:49,069
What are you talking about?

1862
02:08:49,069 --> 02:08:51,069
The channel got fucking compromised.

1863
02:08:51,069 --> 02:08:53,069
No, no, no, I'm going to do my cooking segment,

1864
02:08:53,069 --> 02:08:55,069
but what are you talking about?

1865
02:08:55,069 --> 02:08:57,069
I'm so sorry, dude, but

1866
02:08:57,069 --> 02:08:59,069
everything's, we're going crazy here.

1867
02:08:59,069 --> 02:09:01,069
That's not fair, that's not fair.

1868
02:09:01,069 --> 02:09:03,069
You told me, very specifically.

1869
02:09:03,069 --> 02:09:05,069
I know.

1870
02:09:05,069 --> 02:09:07,069
You said, oh, Bugleberry,

1871
02:09:07,069 --> 02:09:09,069
you can have one segment this year.

1872
02:09:09,069 --> 02:09:11,069
Oh, okay, you can do whatever you want.

1873
02:09:11,069 --> 02:09:13,069
This is my one segment, and you're going to take this from me?

1874
02:09:13,069 --> 02:09:15,069
I don't...

1875
02:09:15,069 --> 02:09:17,069
Why, exactly?

1876
02:09:17,069 --> 02:09:19,069
I don't want to, but the channel was hacked,

1877
02:09:19,069 --> 02:09:21,069
and we need your help right now.

1878
02:09:21,069 --> 02:09:23,069
Maybe if you could make some stuff happen,

1879
02:09:23,069 --> 02:09:25,069
you could cast a spell on his computer or something like that.

1880
02:09:25,069 --> 02:09:27,069
Maybe... What did you do?

1881
02:09:27,069 --> 02:09:29,069
I didn't do anything. What did you do?

1882
02:09:29,069 --> 02:09:31,069
I didn't do anything. What website were you on?

1883
02:09:31,069 --> 02:09:33,069
Let's look at your history.

1884
02:09:33,069 --> 02:09:35,069
Oh, what are you going to do?

1885
02:09:35,069 --> 02:09:37,069
Oh, a pornographic website, perhaps?

1886
02:09:37,069 --> 02:09:39,069
No. Is that what you did?

1887
02:09:39,069 --> 02:09:41,069
No.

1888
02:09:41,069 --> 02:09:43,069
I've been here for like four days, Bugleberry, please.

1889
02:09:43,069 --> 02:09:45,069
What do you want me to do?

1890
02:09:45,069 --> 02:09:47,069
Just help.

1891
02:09:47,069 --> 02:09:49,949
I don't have anything here.

1892
02:09:49,949 --> 02:09:51,949
I don't have anything here.

1893
02:09:51,949 --> 02:09:53,949
I don't have any tools.

1894
02:09:53,949 --> 02:09:55,949
I don't have any of my spellbooks.

1895
02:09:55,949 --> 02:09:57,949
I came to make a holiday dinner.

1896
02:09:57,949 --> 02:09:59,949
Yes, I know.

1897
02:09:59,949 --> 02:10:01,949
You told me to leave all of my things at home.

1898
02:10:01,949 --> 02:10:03,949
You said, don't bring the spellbook.

1899
02:10:03,949 --> 02:10:05,949
You don't need it.

1900
02:10:05,949 --> 02:10:07,949
So it's not here. So what do you want me to do?

1901
02:10:07,949 --> 02:10:09,949
You're improvised.

1902
02:10:09,949 --> 02:10:11,949
Maybe you do... Can you do anything?

1903
02:10:11,949 --> 02:10:13,949
Maybe cast a spell?

1904
02:10:13,949 --> 02:10:15,949
I don't know what you can bring...

1905
02:10:15,949 --> 02:10:17,949
Bugleberry, can you please come on the show and make a turkey?

1906
02:10:18,949 --> 02:10:20,949
I'm sorry, dude.

1907
02:10:20,949 --> 02:10:22,949
I'm so sorry.

1908
02:10:22,949 --> 02:10:24,949
I don't have anything but time to try again.

1909
02:10:24,949 --> 02:10:26,949
I told you, yeah, we can make a turkey, but...

1910
02:10:26,949 --> 02:10:28,949
What is this for? Is this what you call a hacker?

1911
02:10:28,949 --> 02:10:30,949
Yes.

1912
02:10:30,949 --> 02:10:32,949
The channel has been compromised.

1913
02:10:32,949 --> 02:10:34,949
A hacker hacked the channel.

1914
02:10:34,949 --> 02:10:36,949
If you could do anything you can to help...

1915
02:10:36,949 --> 02:10:38,949
Engineers are useless, by the way.

1916
02:10:38,949 --> 02:10:40,949
I'm sorry, but you are.

1917
02:10:40,949 --> 02:10:43,750
What are you doing?

1918
02:10:43,750 --> 02:10:45,750
I'm going to do what I can, gentlemen.

1919
02:10:45,750 --> 02:10:47,750
Just hold on, hold tight.

1920
02:10:47,750 --> 02:10:49,750
Dude, you have no idea what this means.

1921
02:10:49,750 --> 02:10:59,659
I'll make it up to you, I promise.

1922
02:10:59,659 --> 02:11:01,960
What are you doing?

1923
02:11:01,960 --> 02:11:03,960
That's ketchup, Bugleberry.

1924
02:11:07,220 --> 02:11:10,680
What is he doing?

1925
02:11:10,680 --> 02:11:12,680
Cool, cool, cool.

1926
02:11:12,680 --> 02:11:15,180
I don't know what that is, but...

1927
02:11:15,180 --> 02:11:17,180
Everybody, I need you to stand back.

1928
02:11:17,180 --> 02:11:19,180
And that is production.

1929
02:11:19,180 --> 02:11:21,180
Stand back. Everybody watching, please be careful.

1930
02:11:21,180 --> 02:11:23,180
I don't know what could happen here.

1931
02:11:23,180 --> 02:11:25,180
I'm not entirely sure.

1932
02:11:25,180 --> 02:11:28,439
What are you going to do?

1933
02:11:28,439 --> 02:11:30,439
Don't do anything too weird, though.

1934
02:11:30,439 --> 02:11:33,619
Oh, my God.

1935
02:11:33,619 --> 02:11:36,569
Don't do anything too weird.

1936
02:11:36,569 --> 02:11:39,380
You all right?

1937
02:11:39,380 --> 02:11:45,930
What the fuck are you doing?

1938
02:11:45,930 --> 02:11:48,810
That's connected to the toilet.

1939
02:11:48,810 --> 02:11:50,810
That's not connected to anything.

1940
02:11:50,810 --> 02:11:52,810
Oh, God.

1941
02:11:52,810 --> 02:11:54,810
Can you feel it? Can anybody feel it?

1942
02:11:54,810 --> 02:11:57,239
I can. Tell them.

1943
02:11:57,239 --> 02:11:59,539
What?

1944
02:11:59,539 --> 02:12:01,539
You need to hold on to something.

1945
02:12:01,539 --> 02:12:03,539
All right, I'm holding on.

1946
02:12:03,539 --> 02:12:05,539
Oh, yes.

1947
02:12:05,539 --> 02:12:07,539
What is that? What is going on?

1948
02:12:07,539 --> 02:12:13,239
There we go.

1949
02:12:13,239 --> 02:12:16,500
What the fuck?

1950
02:12:16,500 --> 02:12:20,329
Hello.

1951
02:12:20,329 --> 02:12:22,569
Jesus.

1952
02:12:22,569 --> 02:12:24,569
No.

1953
02:12:24,569 --> 02:12:27,640
Put that down.

1954
02:12:27,640 --> 02:12:29,640
This is a sacrificial circle, Gerber.

1955
02:12:29,640 --> 02:12:31,819
Precisely what you wanted.

1956
02:12:31,819 --> 02:12:33,819
No.

1957
02:12:33,819 --> 02:12:36,569
What are you willing to give up?

1958
02:12:36,569 --> 02:12:38,569
I'm willing to hear it.

1959
02:12:38,569 --> 02:12:40,569
I'm nothing. I don't want to do anything.

1960
02:12:40,569 --> 02:12:42,569
Good shot.

1961
02:12:42,569 --> 02:12:44,569
Bugleberry, you could do something else, maybe.

1962
02:12:44,569 --> 02:12:46,939
Do something else.

1963
02:12:46,939 --> 02:12:48,939
What are you talking about?

1964
02:12:48,939 --> 02:12:50,939
Do something else. I don't want to do that.

1965
02:12:50,939 --> 02:12:52,939
Don't put the spell back in.

1966
02:12:52,939 --> 02:12:54,939
The spell is here now.

1967
02:12:54,939 --> 02:12:56,939
We need to sacrifice something that you care about very much.

1968
02:12:56,939 --> 02:12:58,939
Dude.

1969
02:12:58,939 --> 02:13:00,939
How about the presents under the tree?

1970
02:13:00,939 --> 02:13:02,939
No.

1971
02:13:02,939 --> 02:13:04,939
We will sacrifice something else.

1972
02:13:04,939 --> 02:13:08,939
Does a crew member have something that we can put in?

1973
02:13:08,939 --> 02:13:10,939
We're not going to sacrifice.

1974
02:13:10,939 --> 02:13:12,939
That's not happening.

1975
02:13:12,939 --> 02:13:14,939
It has to be something that you care about, Gerber.

1976
02:13:14,939 --> 02:13:16,939
Not something that anybody else does.

1977
02:13:16,939 --> 02:13:18,939
Let's go get those presents.

1978
02:13:18,939 --> 02:13:20,939
No.

1979
02:13:20,939 --> 02:13:22,939
Don't touch those presents.

1980
02:13:22,939 --> 02:13:24,939
It's the only way, Gerber.

1981
02:13:24,939 --> 02:13:26,939
Don't touch those presents. Those are my presents.

1982
02:13:26,939 --> 02:13:28,939
Do not touch them.

1983
02:13:28,939 --> 02:13:30,939
Get out of here.

1984
02:13:30,939 --> 02:13:32,939
No.

1985
02:13:32,939 --> 02:13:34,939
Please leave a couple.

1986
02:13:34,939 --> 02:13:36,939
This is my present.

1987
02:13:36,939 --> 02:13:38,939
Bugleberry, come on.

1988
02:13:38,939 --> 02:13:40,939
There's got to be something else you can do besides this.

1989
02:13:40,939 --> 02:13:42,939
Don't listen.

1990
02:13:42,939 --> 02:13:44,939
Don't listen to him.

1991
02:13:44,939 --> 02:13:48,010
Wait. Is he still there?

1992
02:13:48,010 --> 02:13:50,010
Bugleberry, wait. Stop.

1993
02:13:50,010 --> 02:13:52,010
Stop.

1994
02:13:52,010 --> 02:13:54,250
Can you hear me?

1995
02:13:54,250 --> 02:13:56,250
What the fuck, dude?

1996
02:13:56,250 --> 02:13:58,250
Those are mine.

1997
02:13:58,250 --> 02:14:01,130
I don't even know what's in those.

1998
02:14:01,130 --> 02:14:03,130
Pump me into him. Is he still there?

1999
02:14:03,130 --> 02:14:05,130
Bugleberry, can you hear me?

2000
02:14:05,130 --> 02:14:07,130
Don't touch.

2001
02:14:07,130 --> 02:14:09,369
Please leave a couple, please.

2002
02:14:09,369 --> 02:14:11,369
Oh, my God.

2003
02:14:11,369 --> 02:14:13,369
These are heavy.

2004
02:14:13,369 --> 02:14:15,369
I don't want to do this.

2005
02:14:15,369 --> 02:14:19,380
I don't want to do this.

2006
02:14:19,380 --> 02:14:21,880
I don't want to do this.

2007
02:14:21,880 --> 02:14:23,880
Anything else, please.

2008
02:14:23,880 --> 02:14:25,880
Anything else.

2009
02:14:25,880 --> 02:14:28,439
Gerber, there's no going back like I already said.

2010
02:14:30,810 --> 02:14:32,810
Oh, this is a new iPhone.

2011
02:14:32,810 --> 02:14:34,810
They get bigger every year.

2012
02:14:34,810 --> 02:14:36,810
Is it an iPhone?

2013
02:14:36,810 --> 02:14:38,810
Jesus.

2014
02:14:38,810 --> 02:14:41,560
Can you hear the screams?

2015
02:14:41,560 --> 02:14:43,560
I can. What's this one?

2016
02:14:43,560 --> 02:14:45,560
Oh, sounds like an Xbox.

2017
02:14:45,560 --> 02:14:47,560
Xbox.

2018
02:14:47,560 --> 02:14:49,560
Does it look like an Xbox?

2019
02:14:49,560 --> 02:14:51,560
That's my Xbox.

2020
02:14:51,560 --> 02:14:53,560
Maybe it's not.

2021
02:14:53,560 --> 02:14:55,560
Bugleberry, don't put that one in, maybe it's an Xbox.

2022
02:14:55,560 --> 02:14:59,449
Jesus.

2023
02:15:01,449 --> 02:15:03,449
That was juicy.

2024
02:15:03,449 --> 02:15:06,010
Oh, my God.

2025
02:15:06,010 --> 02:15:08,010
This one. Oh, a new sweater.

2026
02:15:08,010 --> 02:15:10,010
Is this possibly a sweater?

2027
02:15:10,010 --> 02:15:12,010
Is this possibly a sweater?

2028
02:15:12,010 --> 02:15:14,010
Oh, what size are you, Gerber?

2029
02:15:14,010 --> 02:15:16,010
Maybe I could wear it.

2030
02:15:16,010 --> 02:15:18,010
I'm a medium.

2031
02:15:18,010 --> 02:15:20,010
I'm going in. I'm going in there.

2032
02:15:20,010 --> 02:15:22,010
I'm going in.

2033
02:15:22,010 --> 02:15:24,010
Let me in.

2034
02:15:26,010 --> 02:15:28,010
Come on. Get off of me.

2035
02:15:28,010 --> 02:15:30,010
He must stick with it.

2036
02:15:30,010 --> 02:15:32,010
This is a double.

2037
02:15:32,010 --> 02:15:34,010
This is a DVD.

2038
02:15:34,010 --> 02:15:36,010
Two-part DVD.

2039
02:15:36,010 --> 02:15:38,010
Oh, no, this might be Final Fantasy VII

2040
02:15:38,010 --> 02:15:40,010
for the PlayStation 1, his favorite game.

2041
02:15:40,010 --> 02:15:42,010
That game sucks. I don't care.

2042
02:15:42,010 --> 02:15:44,010
Put that one in.

2043
02:15:44,010 --> 02:15:46,010
Put that one in. I don't care.

2044
02:15:46,010 --> 02:15:48,010
That's probably the only one I don't care about.

2045
02:15:48,010 --> 02:15:50,010
What's this? What's this one?

2046
02:15:50,010 --> 02:15:52,010
This one's making noise, Gerber.

2047
02:15:52,010 --> 02:15:54,010
What's in it?

2048
02:15:54,010 --> 02:15:56,010
You don't want me to put it in?

2049
02:15:56,010 --> 02:15:58,010
Don't put it in. Don't put that one in.

2050
02:15:58,010 --> 02:16:00,010
Leave me one present, Bugleberry, please.

2051
02:16:00,010 --> 02:16:02,010
One present.

2052
02:16:02,010 --> 02:16:04,010
Thank you. Thank God I get one.

2053
02:16:04,010 --> 02:16:07,529
Jesus.

2054
02:16:10,979 --> 02:16:13,479
How are you doing over there, Gerber?

2055
02:16:13,479 --> 02:16:15,479
I have no idea. I just feel sick.

2056
02:16:15,479 --> 02:16:17,479
I don't know.

2057
02:16:17,479 --> 02:16:19,909
What should I be feeling?

2058
02:16:19,909 --> 02:16:22,409
What are you doing?

2059
02:16:26,500 --> 02:16:32,389
That's two points, Gerber. Two points.

2060
02:16:32,389 --> 02:16:34,389
Two points, yeah. Bugleberry, I feel fucking sick.

2061
02:16:36,389 --> 02:16:38,389
Let's see. I don't even know what it was.

2062
02:16:38,389 --> 02:16:40,389
What was it?

2063
02:16:40,389 --> 02:16:42,389
Bugleberry, something's wrong.

2064
02:16:42,389 --> 02:16:45,340
How do you feel?

2065
02:16:45,340 --> 02:16:50,520
What the fuck was that?

2066
02:16:50,520 --> 02:16:52,520
Bugleberry, stop.

2067
02:16:52,520 --> 02:16:54,520
Stop. Stop it right. Please stop.

2068
02:16:54,520 --> 02:16:56,520
Oh, boy.

2069
02:16:56,520 --> 02:16:58,520
Hey.

2070
02:16:58,520 --> 02:17:00,950
I don't even know what's happening.

2071
02:17:03,319 --> 02:17:06,200
My chest hurts.

2072
02:17:06,200 --> 02:17:08,200
My chest hurts.

2073
02:17:08,200 --> 02:17:10,200
Is it even doing anything?

2074
02:17:10,200 --> 02:17:12,200
I don't think it's doing anything.

2075
02:17:14,200 --> 02:17:17,590
I don't think it's working.

2076
02:17:17,590 --> 02:17:20,090
Can you feel it, Gerber?

2077
02:17:20,090 --> 02:17:22,090
Can you feel it?

2078
02:17:22,090 --> 02:17:24,090
I don't know. I don't think so. Maybe.

2079
02:17:24,090 --> 02:17:27,659
What?

2080
02:17:27,659 --> 02:17:29,659
Nothing's happening.

2081
02:17:29,659 --> 02:17:31,959
What do you mean it's not enough?

2082
02:17:31,959 --> 02:17:33,959
I don't think it's happening.

2083
02:17:33,959 --> 02:17:35,959
I didn't get the channel half.

2084
02:17:35,959 --> 02:17:37,959
Now did I?

2085
02:17:37,959 --> 02:17:39,959
No.

2086
02:17:39,959 --> 02:17:41,959
You know what? Fine. You want power.

2087
02:17:41,959 --> 02:17:48,489
You want magical listeners.

2088
02:17:48,489 --> 02:17:50,489
I'll give it to you.

2089
02:17:50,489 --> 02:17:52,659
Stop.

2090
02:17:52,659 --> 02:17:54,659
Hello. Hello.

2091
02:17:54,659 --> 02:17:56,659
What's this?

2092
02:17:56,659 --> 02:17:58,659
A new box of chocolates.

2093
02:17:58,659 --> 02:18:00,659
Whatever it is, it doesn't matter.

2094
02:18:00,659 --> 02:18:02,659
Oh.

2095
02:18:02,659 --> 02:18:04,659
Oh.

2096
02:18:04,659 --> 02:18:06,659
Oh.

2097
02:18:06,659 --> 02:18:08,659
Don't ask me for anything ever again.

2098
02:18:08,659 --> 02:18:10,659
And by the way, if you invite somebody to a party

2099
02:18:10,659 --> 02:18:12,659
and you tell them to do something,

2100
02:18:12,659 --> 02:18:14,659
make sure it's what you actually say

2101
02:18:14,659 --> 02:18:16,659
and not this whole crap.

2102
02:18:16,659 --> 02:18:18,659
I don't want to swear, but I just...

2103
02:18:18,659 --> 02:18:20,659
Dude, easy on the language, please.

2104
02:18:20,659 --> 02:18:22,659
No, no.

2105
02:18:22,659 --> 02:18:24,659
I don't want to go home.

2106
02:18:24,659 --> 02:18:26,659
Oh, boy.

2107
02:18:26,659 --> 02:18:28,659
Oh, boy.

2108
02:18:28,659 --> 02:18:37,690
What the fuck just happened?

2109
02:18:37,690 --> 02:18:40,500
What happened?

2110
02:18:40,500 --> 02:18:42,940
What's going on?

2111
02:18:42,940 --> 02:18:46,329
Hey.

2112
02:18:46,329 --> 02:18:48,329
It's you.

2113
02:18:48,329 --> 02:18:50,329
It's you.

2114
02:18:50,329 --> 02:18:52,329
It's you, motherfucker. I see you now.

2115
02:18:52,329 --> 02:18:54,329
I see you.

2116
02:18:54,329 --> 02:18:56,329
I see you.

2117
02:18:56,329 --> 02:18:58,329
What do I do about this?

2118
02:18:58,329 --> 02:19:00,329
What do I do?

2119
02:19:00,329 --> 02:19:02,329
Oh, now you're scared?

2120
02:19:02,329 --> 02:19:04,329
That's why I had a magician.

2121
02:19:04,329 --> 02:19:06,329
I know a guy. You know hacking.

2122
02:19:06,329 --> 02:19:08,329
I got dark magic, motherfucker,

2123
02:19:08,329 --> 02:19:10,329
and I come for you now.

2124
02:19:10,329 --> 02:19:14,299
What did you do?

2125
02:19:14,299 --> 02:19:16,860
What is that?

2126
02:19:16,860 --> 02:19:18,860
I know we don't really know each other

2127
02:19:18,860 --> 02:19:20,860
and this is really strange.

2128
02:19:20,860 --> 02:19:22,860
It's really weird, everything going on,

2129
02:19:22,860 --> 02:19:24,860
but is your room cold right now?

2130
02:19:24,860 --> 02:19:26,860
It's very cold.

2131
02:19:26,860 --> 02:19:28,860
My nips are...

2132
02:19:28,860 --> 02:19:31,670
Do you have a heater here?

2133
02:19:31,670 --> 02:19:33,670
Yes.

2134
02:19:33,670 --> 02:19:35,670
I have something down here.

2135
02:19:35,670 --> 02:19:37,670
I don't know what this is. It's a swirling thing.

2136
02:19:37,670 --> 02:19:39,670
Do you have one of those in your room, dude?

2137
02:19:39,670 --> 02:19:41,670
Yeah, yes.

2138
02:19:41,670 --> 02:19:43,670
Okay.

2139
02:19:43,670 --> 02:19:45,670
I'll be honest.

2140
02:19:45,670 --> 02:19:47,850
This is kind of freaking me out.

2141
02:19:47,850 --> 02:19:49,850
Hopefully Bugleberry's okay.

2142
02:19:49,850 --> 02:19:51,850
Do we call someone?

2143
02:19:51,850 --> 02:19:53,850
I don't know. Hold on.

2144
02:19:53,850 --> 02:19:55,850
I put my hand in here.

2145
02:19:55,850 --> 02:19:57,850
What the...

2146
02:19:57,850 --> 02:20:00,920
Was that you?

2147
02:20:00,920 --> 02:20:02,920
Was that you?

2148
02:20:02,920 --> 02:20:04,920
Was that you?

2149
02:20:04,920 --> 02:20:06,920
I don't know.

2150
02:20:06,920 --> 02:20:08,920
Did it feel like someone slapped your hand?

2151
02:20:08,920 --> 02:20:10,920
It felt like somebody slapped my hand.

2152
02:20:10,920 --> 02:20:12,920
Did you touch me?

2153
02:20:12,920 --> 02:20:15,420
That was me.

2154
02:20:15,420 --> 02:20:17,420
You motherfucker!

2155
02:20:17,420 --> 02:20:19,420
How does that feel, huh?

2156
02:20:19,420 --> 02:20:21,420
Does that feel weird?

2157
02:20:21,420 --> 02:20:23,420
Does that feel weird?

2158
02:20:23,420 --> 02:20:27,190
God damn it!

2159
02:20:27,190 --> 02:20:29,940
You don't choke me!

2160
02:20:29,940 --> 02:20:31,940
All right, man. You want to fuck around?

2161
02:20:31,940 --> 02:20:33,940
How does this sound?

2162
02:20:33,940 --> 02:20:35,940
Don't you...

2163
02:20:35,940 --> 02:20:37,940
I'm going to kick you in the goddamn face.

2164
02:20:37,940 --> 02:20:39,940
How does that sound?

2165
02:20:39,940 --> 02:20:42,629
Let go!

2166
02:20:42,629 --> 02:20:44,629
Let go!

2167
02:20:44,629 --> 02:20:46,629
Let go!

2168
02:20:46,629 --> 02:20:48,629
Put it back!

2169
02:20:48,629 --> 02:20:52,149
What is wrong with you?

2170
02:20:52,149 --> 02:20:54,459
Those were nice kids, by the way.

2171
02:20:54,459 --> 02:20:56,459
Yeah, they are nice shoes.

2172
02:20:56,459 --> 02:20:58,459
I'm glad you like them. You know what?

2173
02:20:58,459 --> 02:21:01,139
Look at you.

2174
02:21:01,139 --> 02:21:03,139
My camera's all twisted.

2175
02:21:03,139 --> 02:21:05,139
How do you feel about this, you piece of shit?

2176
02:21:05,139 --> 02:21:07,139
It's a piece of wood.

2177
02:21:07,139 --> 02:21:09,139
Yeah, it's a piece of wood. It'll knock your fucking teeth out.

2178
02:21:09,139 --> 02:21:11,139
What are you going to do with a piece of wood?

2179
02:21:11,139 --> 02:21:13,139
I'm coming in there and I'm going to...

2180
02:21:13,139 --> 02:21:15,139
I'm going to knock your head off!

2181
02:21:15,139 --> 02:21:17,139
Hold it right there, boys.

2182
02:21:17,139 --> 02:21:19,139
Santa!

2183
02:21:19,139 --> 02:21:21,139
This has got to stop.

2184
02:21:21,139 --> 02:21:23,139
This is not

2185
02:21:23,139 --> 02:21:25,139
the Christmas spirit.

2186
02:21:25,139 --> 02:21:27,379
What?

2187
02:21:27,379 --> 02:21:29,379
Santa!

2188
02:21:29,379 --> 02:21:31,379
Santa!

2189
02:21:31,379 --> 02:21:33,379
Young man, get over here.

2190
02:21:33,379 --> 02:21:35,379
What do you mean?

2191
02:21:35,379 --> 02:21:37,559
There's a Santa here?

2192
02:21:37,559 --> 02:21:39,559
I mean, that's kind of funny.

2193
02:21:39,559 --> 02:21:43,020
There was nobody here before.

2194
02:21:43,020 --> 02:21:45,020
Put that stick down.

2195
02:21:45,020 --> 02:21:47,020
What?

2196
02:21:47,020 --> 02:21:49,020
I remember the last time you used that stick.

2197
02:21:49,020 --> 02:21:51,020
It's real.

2198
02:21:51,020 --> 02:21:53,020
It's him. It's really him.

2199
02:21:53,020 --> 02:21:55,020
That's a real Santa. That's a real Santa.

2200
02:21:55,020 --> 02:21:57,020
Dude, bro. This is a real Santa, I think.

2201
02:21:57,020 --> 02:21:59,020
We cannot have any more of this.

2202
02:21:59,020 --> 02:22:01,020
You're ruining Christmas with your dark magic

2203
02:22:01,020 --> 02:22:03,020
and your foul mouth.

2204
02:22:03,020 --> 02:22:05,020
I'm...

2205
02:22:05,020 --> 02:22:07,020
I don't know what to say, but...

2206
02:22:07,020 --> 02:22:09,020
I mean, the magic was...

2207
02:22:09,020 --> 02:22:11,020
was not with me. I hired somebody to come

2208
02:22:11,020 --> 02:22:13,020
and hang out. I don't know what to say.

2209
02:22:13,020 --> 02:22:15,020
Well, my magic-ometer

2210
02:22:15,020 --> 02:22:17,020
sensed it all the way from the North Pole

2211
02:22:17,020 --> 02:22:19,020
that something was not right in this place.

2212
02:22:19,020 --> 02:22:21,020
And I've come to set the

2213
02:22:21,020 --> 02:22:23,020
Christmas spirit right again.

2214
02:22:23,020 --> 02:22:25,020
Okay. Okay.

2215
02:22:25,020 --> 02:22:27,020
But that's going to require change

2216
02:22:27,020 --> 02:22:29,020
for both of your parts.

2217
02:22:29,020 --> 02:22:31,260
Okay.

2218
02:22:31,260 --> 02:22:33,260
What do you mean? What do you want us to do?

2219
02:22:33,260 --> 02:22:35,260
I want you to reconcile

2220
02:22:35,260 --> 02:22:37,260
as brothers.

2221
02:22:37,260 --> 02:22:39,260
I want an apology from both of you.

2222
02:22:39,260 --> 02:22:41,260
And we're going to start with

2223
02:22:41,260 --> 02:22:43,260
Extinguisher.

2224
02:22:43,260 --> 02:22:45,260
With me, Santa?

2225
02:22:45,260 --> 02:22:47,260
Yes. You get the chance to go first

2226
02:22:47,260 --> 02:22:49,260
to be nice

2227
02:22:49,260 --> 02:22:51,500
and to apologize to this little boy.

2228
02:22:51,500 --> 02:22:53,500
I'm out of my ground, man.

2229
02:22:53,500 --> 02:22:56,680
Well, when you put it like that...

2230
02:22:56,680 --> 02:22:58,680
I'm sorry, Jerma,

2231
02:22:58,680 --> 02:23:00,680
for hacking your stream

2232
02:23:00,680 --> 02:23:02,680
and playing the best game of Call of Duty

2233
02:23:02,680 --> 02:23:04,680
that I've ever put on board.

2234
02:23:04,680 --> 02:23:06,680
Yeah.

2235
02:23:06,680 --> 02:23:09,239
My bad.

2236
02:23:09,239 --> 02:23:11,420
Anything else?

2237
02:23:11,420 --> 02:23:14,040
You're not. I really do like

2238
02:23:14,040 --> 02:23:16,040
your butt cheeks.

2239
02:23:16,040 --> 02:23:18,040
There's no place for that here,

2240
02:23:18,040 --> 02:23:21,500
Extinguisher. Thank you.

2241
02:23:21,500 --> 02:23:23,500
This is a compliment, Santa, but

2242
02:23:23,500 --> 02:23:25,500
you're right. Well, I...

2243
02:23:25,500 --> 02:23:27,500
I mean, Santa...

2244
02:23:27,500 --> 02:23:29,500
He hacked my... He hacked my channel

2245
02:23:29,500 --> 02:23:31,500
and he tried to...

2246
02:23:31,500 --> 02:23:33,500
He wiped out my bank account

2247
02:23:33,500 --> 02:23:35,500
and he hacked the channel and I ruined

2248
02:23:35,500 --> 02:23:37,500
my Christmas show and it was really kind of annoying.

2249
02:23:37,500 --> 02:23:39,500
Selfishness

2250
02:23:39,500 --> 02:23:41,500
doesn't sound like an apology.

2251
02:23:41,500 --> 02:23:43,989
No, it's not.

2252
02:23:43,989 --> 02:23:45,989
Extinguisher, I am sorry

2253
02:23:45,989 --> 02:23:47,989
that I

2254
02:23:47,989 --> 02:23:49,989
called you a dork. I said that your

2255
02:23:49,989 --> 02:23:51,989
hacking abilities weren't very good. I mean,

2256
02:23:51,989 --> 02:23:53,989
you seem like kind of a nice guy.

2257
02:23:53,989 --> 02:23:55,989
And then you seem like pretty cool.

2258
02:23:55,989 --> 02:23:57,989
So, I'm sorry.

2259
02:23:57,989 --> 02:23:59,989
Really? Yeah.

2260
02:23:59,989 --> 02:24:01,989
Is that sincere, young man?

2261
02:24:01,989 --> 02:24:04,170
Yeah.

2262
02:24:04,170 --> 02:24:06,170
And that's... I also maybe want to say sorry

2263
02:24:06,170 --> 02:24:08,170
to the crew. I think I was a little

2264
02:24:08,170 --> 02:24:10,170
mean earlier. I've just been under

2265
02:24:10,170 --> 02:24:12,170
a lot of stress. And...

2266
02:24:12,170 --> 02:24:14,170
Stress? Stress.

2267
02:24:14,170 --> 02:24:16,170
And who else do you need to apologize to?

2268
02:24:18,170 --> 02:24:20,340
Maybe my mother, because she

2269
02:24:20,340 --> 02:24:22,340
thought I was going to be a doctor and I ended up being a clown

2270
02:24:22,340 --> 02:24:24,340
on the internet. But, I mean, still doing pretty well.

2271
02:24:24,340 --> 02:24:26,340
And sorry, mom.

2272
02:24:26,340 --> 02:24:28,340
I think that covers it.

2273
02:24:28,340 --> 02:24:30,340
Anyone else?

2274
02:24:30,340 --> 02:24:35,139
Jerma.

2275
02:24:35,139 --> 02:24:37,139
Oh, right. The two by four.

2276
02:24:37,139 --> 02:24:39,139
I'm sorry, Santa.

2277
02:24:39,139 --> 02:24:41,139
For... I didn't...

2278
02:24:41,139 --> 02:24:43,139
I didn't know. How am I supposed to know when I...

2279
02:24:43,139 --> 02:24:45,139
Excuses. But how am I supposed to know

2280
02:24:45,139 --> 02:24:47,139
that it was you? I didn't

2281
02:24:47,139 --> 02:24:49,139
mean to get you with that. I'm sorry.

2282
02:24:49,139 --> 02:24:51,139
Spit it out. I'm very sorry to

2283
02:24:51,139 --> 02:24:53,139
everybody. Okay. Well, that's

2284
02:24:53,139 --> 02:24:55,139
what I like to hear.

2285
02:24:55,139 --> 02:24:57,139
And Santa likes when you

2286
02:24:57,139 --> 02:24:59,139
make nice. Thank you.

2287
02:24:59,139 --> 02:25:01,139
This is very big. You're welcome.

2288
02:25:01,139 --> 02:25:03,139
I have a big candy cane.

2289
02:25:03,139 --> 02:25:05,139
And now, now that we have

2290
02:25:05,139 --> 02:25:07,139
reconciliation here,

2291
02:25:07,139 --> 02:25:09,139
I can finally grant

2292
02:25:09,139 --> 02:25:11,139
you your Christmas wishes.

2293
02:25:11,139 --> 02:25:13,379
You've been so

2294
02:25:13,379 --> 02:25:15,379
nice, extinguisher.

2295
02:25:15,379 --> 02:25:17,379
What would you like for Christmas?

2296
02:25:17,379 --> 02:25:19,379
Dude!

2297
02:25:19,379 --> 02:25:21,379
You got a Christmas wish, dude! What are you going to do?

2298
02:25:21,379 --> 02:25:23,379
Oh...

2299
02:25:23,379 --> 02:25:25,379
Oh, I got it.

2300
02:25:25,379 --> 02:25:27,559
Can you please,

2301
02:25:27,559 --> 02:25:29,559
please make me silver in League

2302
02:25:29,559 --> 02:25:31,559
of Legends?

2303
02:25:31,559 --> 02:25:33,559
It's about

2304
02:25:33,559 --> 02:25:35,559
time you got out of bronze. Yeah.

2305
02:25:37,559 --> 02:25:40,440
Did you get it? There you go.

2306
02:25:40,440 --> 02:25:42,440
I'm silver!

2307
02:25:42,440 --> 02:25:44,440
Thanks, Santa!

2308
02:25:44,440 --> 02:25:46,440
You're welcome, little boy.

2309
02:25:46,440 --> 02:25:48,440
It worked? Do you actually silver?

2310
02:25:48,440 --> 02:25:50,440
Yeah. Dude, that's sick.

2311
02:25:50,440 --> 02:25:52,440
So sick. Wow.

2312
02:25:52,440 --> 02:25:54,440
And now for you,

2313
02:25:54,440 --> 02:25:56,440
Jeremo. Money.

2314
02:25:56,440 --> 02:25:58,440
Oh, that's a good one. Greed. Ten million

2315
02:25:58,440 --> 02:26:00,440
at least.

2316
02:26:00,440 --> 02:26:02,440
Try again.

2317
02:26:02,440 --> 02:26:04,680
I wish

2318
02:26:04,680 --> 02:26:07,299
for the things to

2319
02:26:07,299 --> 02:26:09,299
kind of go back to normal. The way

2320
02:26:09,299 --> 02:26:11,299
they were before extinguisher

2321
02:26:11,299 --> 02:26:13,299
came on and hacked. I'd like

2322
02:26:13,299 --> 02:26:15,299
to do the rest of my awards

2323
02:26:15,299 --> 02:26:17,299
and just chill and have a good time.

2324
02:26:17,299 --> 02:26:19,299
The way things should have been, had you been nice.

2325
02:26:19,299 --> 02:26:21,930
That's true.

2326
02:26:21,930 --> 02:26:23,930
Ho, ho, ho! You're right. Santa can

2327
02:26:23,930 --> 02:26:27,319
do that.

2328
02:26:27,319 --> 02:26:29,319
Whoa!

2329
02:26:29,319 --> 02:26:31,319
Did it work? How do you feel?

2330
02:26:31,319 --> 02:26:33,319
I feel great!

2331
02:26:33,319 --> 02:26:35,319
Do you? It's all jiggly inside.

2332
02:26:35,319 --> 02:26:37,319
Hey, how about this?

2333
02:26:37,319 --> 02:26:39,319
I'll take you to lunch.

2334
02:26:39,319 --> 02:26:41,319
What? I've got at least ten

2335
02:26:41,319 --> 02:26:43,319
minutes on Friday if you want to hang out.

2336
02:26:43,319 --> 02:26:45,319
I've got fifteen minutes on Friday.

2337
02:26:45,319 --> 02:26:47,319
Wow.

2338
02:26:47,319 --> 02:26:49,319
I've got an hour on Friday.

2339
02:26:49,319 --> 02:26:51,319
Minimum.

2340
02:26:51,319 --> 02:26:53,319
That calls for a real sit down restaurant.

2341
02:26:53,319 --> 02:26:55,319
Do you like Ruby Tuesdays?

2342
02:26:55,319 --> 02:26:57,319
Yeah! Let's do it!

2343
02:26:57,319 --> 02:26:59,319
Alright! You and me are going to go!

2344
02:26:59,319 --> 02:27:01,319
It's good to see you

2345
02:27:01,319 --> 02:27:03,319
playing nice together again.

2346
02:27:03,319 --> 02:27:05,319
Thank you. Thank you.

2347
02:27:05,319 --> 02:27:07,319
Thank you! Bye bye!

2348
02:27:07,319 --> 02:27:09,319
Santa, thank you so much!

2349
02:27:09,319 --> 02:27:11,319
That was unbelievable!

2350
02:27:11,319 --> 02:27:13,319
Bye everyone! The power

2351
02:27:13,319 --> 02:27:15,319
of Christmas.

2352
02:27:15,319 --> 02:27:17,319
And the right magic. Not that dark stuff.

2353
02:27:17,319 --> 02:27:19,319
You can never go back to that again.

2354
02:27:19,319 --> 02:27:21,319
Well, I think Bugleberry might be dead.

2355
02:27:21,319 --> 02:27:23,319
Or he's gone. I have no idea

2356
02:27:23,319 --> 02:27:25,319
where he is, but

2357
02:27:25,319 --> 02:27:27,319
we might not see him for a long time.

2358
02:27:27,319 --> 02:27:29,319
And remember, the mouth speaks

2359
02:27:29,319 --> 02:27:31,319
out of that which fills the heart.

2360
02:27:31,319 --> 02:27:33,319
That's true.

2361
02:27:33,319 --> 02:27:35,319
So keep changing that.

2362
02:27:35,319 --> 02:27:37,319
And to all the community out there,

2363
02:27:37,319 --> 02:27:39,319
I want to remind you

2364
02:27:39,319 --> 02:27:41,319
that this is the season for giving

2365
02:27:41,319 --> 02:27:43,319
and forgiving.

2366
02:27:43,319 --> 02:27:45,319
And a Merry Christmas

2367
02:27:45,319 --> 02:27:47,319
to all!

2368
02:27:47,319 --> 02:27:49,319
Thank you, Santa!

2369
02:27:49,319 --> 02:27:51,319
Seriously!

2370
02:27:51,319 --> 02:27:53,819
And Extinguisher, I'm serious.

2371
02:27:53,819 --> 02:27:55,819
We should go hang out. I'm sorry.

2372
02:27:55,819 --> 02:27:57,819
It is the spirit for giving.

2373
02:27:57,819 --> 02:27:59,819
It is the spirit for reconciliation

2374
02:27:59,819 --> 02:28:01,819
and hanging out and having a good time.

2375
02:28:01,819 --> 02:28:04,950
Holy fucking shit!

2376
02:28:04,950 --> 02:28:06,950
What a disaster.

2377
02:28:06,950 --> 02:28:09,450
What was that?

2378
02:28:09,450 --> 02:28:11,450
I meant to say, Merry Christmas to all

2379
02:28:11,450 --> 02:28:13,450
and to all have a very

2380
02:28:13,450 --> 02:28:15,450
good evening and to all

2381
02:28:15,450 --> 02:28:17,450
good night and Merry Christmas to you.

2382
02:28:17,450 --> 02:28:19,450
And to all a good night!

2383
02:28:23,620 --> 02:28:31,049
Wow. Are we on the channel?

2384
02:28:31,049 --> 02:28:33,049
Are we on my channel now?

2385
02:28:33,049 --> 02:28:39,049
Are we good?

2386
02:28:39,049 --> 02:28:41,049
I'm so sorry, ladies and gentlemen,

2387
02:28:41,049 --> 02:28:43,049
but sometimes it takes the spirit of Christmas.

2388
02:28:43,049 --> 02:28:45,049
Sometimes it takes Santa Claus

2389
02:28:45,049 --> 02:28:47,049
to come out and right the wrongs.

2390
02:28:47,049 --> 02:28:49,540
Ladies and gentlemen, we are not

2391
02:28:49,540 --> 02:28:51,850
done. We are now

2392
02:28:51,850 --> 02:28:53,850
on the channel. We have control.

2393
02:28:53,850 --> 02:28:55,850
We're in fact just getting started.

2394
02:28:55,850 --> 02:28:57,850
So let's go into our

2395
02:28:57,850 --> 02:28:59,850
next category. This is

2396
02:28:59,850 --> 02:29:01,850
category number 11, by the way.

2397
02:29:01,850 --> 02:29:03,850
There are a lot more to do.

2398
02:29:03,850 --> 02:29:05,850
So, this is

2399
02:29:05,850 --> 02:29:07,850
Best Rant, and there's some

2400
02:29:07,850 --> 02:29:09,850
spillage here, and I'm gonna need

2401
02:29:09,850 --> 02:29:11,850
production

2402
02:29:11,850 --> 02:29:13,850
to maybe help me

2403
02:29:13,850 --> 02:29:15,850
eventually after this category.

2404
02:29:15,850 --> 02:29:17,850
Right? I'm not gonna say

2405
02:29:17,850 --> 02:29:19,850
any bad words. I'm not gonna yell

2406
02:29:19,850 --> 02:29:21,850
at anybody. Production,

2407
02:29:21,850 --> 02:29:23,850
I spilled some cocoa earlier

2408
02:29:23,850 --> 02:29:25,850
and

2409
02:29:25,850 --> 02:29:27,850
I may need a little bit of help

2410
02:29:27,850 --> 02:29:29,850
to clean it up. How's that sound?

2411
02:29:29,850 --> 02:29:31,850
There we are.

2412
02:29:31,850 --> 02:29:33,850
Alright, ladies and gentlemen, let's do this category.

2413
02:29:33,850 --> 02:29:35,850
This is Best Rant of the Year.

2414
02:29:35,850 --> 02:29:37,850
Here are your nominees. Thank you, Santa,

2415
02:29:37,850 --> 02:29:39,850
for fixing everything.

2416
02:29:39,850 --> 02:29:49,959
I get exhausted.

2417
02:29:49,959 --> 02:29:51,959
My brain goes like, alright, man,

2418
02:29:51,959 --> 02:29:53,959
that's enough. No humans are supposed to be doing this.

2419
02:29:53,959 --> 02:29:56,459
You know what fucking humans are supposed

2420
02:29:56,459 --> 02:29:58,459
to be doing? Humans are supposed to be

2421
02:29:58,459 --> 02:30:00,459
fucking picking up like a wheelbarrow

2422
02:30:00,459 --> 02:30:02,459
full of like logs

2423
02:30:02,459 --> 02:30:04,459
and just like slowly walking with it

2424
02:30:04,459 --> 02:30:06,459
and delivering those logs to the

2425
02:30:06,459 --> 02:30:08,459
community. And then like those logs

2426
02:30:08,459 --> 02:30:10,459
are used to build houses. And then there's also

2427
02:30:10,459 --> 02:30:12,459
like a baker and like a butcher

2428
02:30:12,459 --> 02:30:14,459
and humans aren't supposed to be

2429
02:30:14,459 --> 02:30:16,459
doing what we're doing right now. Humans aren't

2430
02:30:16,459 --> 02:30:18,459
supposed to be doing this. Guys, when

2431
02:30:18,459 --> 02:30:20,459
Ben Franklin was writing up the goddamn

2432
02:30:20,459 --> 02:30:22,459
fucking Declaration of Independence,

2433
02:30:22,459 --> 02:30:24,459
there was no guggity guggity in there.

2434
02:30:24,459 --> 02:30:26,459
There was no, oh yeah, we also need to make

2435
02:30:26,459 --> 02:30:28,459
sure to leave some room for guggity

2436
02:30:28,459 --> 02:30:30,459
guggity guggity guggity guggity.

2437
02:30:30,459 --> 02:30:32,459
There's no room for that, Ben.

2438
02:30:32,459 --> 02:30:34,459
Goat cheese is so gross.

2439
02:30:34,459 --> 02:30:36,459
Goat cheese is fucking vile.

2440
02:30:36,459 --> 02:30:38,459
Honest to God, I feel like everybody that eats

2441
02:30:38,459 --> 02:30:40,459
people pretend to like goat cheese.

2442
02:30:40,459 --> 02:30:42,459
You pretend to like it.

2443
02:30:42,459 --> 02:30:44,459
I'm so serious. I will die on this hill.

2444
02:30:44,459 --> 02:30:46,459
Goat cheese does not,

2445
02:30:46,459 --> 02:30:48,459
it tastes like dirt. Goat cheese is this

2446
02:30:48,459 --> 02:30:50,459
immediate, immediate

2447
02:30:50,459 --> 02:30:52,459
like

2448
02:30:52,459 --> 02:30:54,459
flavor.

2449
02:30:54,459 --> 02:30:56,459
It's like right when it touches your lip.

2450
02:30:56,459 --> 02:30:58,459
It's just like, oh, what's on this?

2451
02:30:58,459 --> 02:31:00,459
Goat cheese!

2452
02:31:00,459 --> 02:31:02,459
It's immediately, oh, goat cheese,

2453
02:31:02,459 --> 02:31:04,459
bro, I love it.

2454
02:31:04,459 --> 02:31:06,459
Oh, dude,

2455
02:31:06,459 --> 02:31:08,459
I'll eat a ton of it on a cracker. Of course

2456
02:31:08,459 --> 02:31:10,459
I will.

2457
02:31:10,459 --> 02:31:12,459
Yeah, right. What if

2458
02:31:12,459 --> 02:31:14,459
aliens don't have anything? Aliens

2459
02:31:14,459 --> 02:31:16,459
could just be like, oh, wow, you have

2460
02:31:16,459 --> 02:31:18,459
this thing over here that

2461
02:31:18,459 --> 02:31:20,459
keeps your food from spoiling?

2462
02:31:20,459 --> 02:31:22,760
Oh, on our planet,

2463
02:31:22,760 --> 02:31:24,760
fructose,

2464
02:31:24,760 --> 02:31:26,760
we have,

2465
02:31:26,760 --> 02:31:28,760
we got stuff.

2466
02:31:28,760 --> 02:31:30,760
What's that over there?

2467
02:31:30,760 --> 02:31:32,760
Wait, oh, it's a calendar.

2468
02:31:32,760 --> 02:31:34,760
What's that? You keep track of days?

2469
02:31:34,760 --> 02:31:36,760
Who knows, guys? The fact that you

2470
02:31:36,760 --> 02:31:38,760
can have sounds come out of your mouth

2471
02:31:38,760 --> 02:31:40,760
might be the most absurd thing that they've

2472
02:31:40,760 --> 02:31:42,760
ever heard. Hi, Mr. Alien.

2473
02:31:42,760 --> 02:31:44,760
How are you?

2474
02:31:44,760 --> 02:31:46,760
And their heads are going to

2475
02:31:46,760 --> 02:31:48,760
explode.

2476
02:31:48,760 --> 02:31:50,760
Exactly what I told you was going to happen. What?

2477
02:31:50,760 --> 02:31:53,959
What is this?

2478
02:31:53,959 --> 02:31:56,899
What is this?

2479
02:31:56,899 --> 02:31:58,899
Why does this exist? This is magic

2480
02:31:58,899 --> 02:32:00,899
powers.

2481
02:32:00,899 --> 02:32:02,899
The game's fucking easy.

2482
02:32:02,899 --> 02:32:04,899
It's not even a hard game. Instant kill moves are stupid.

2483
02:32:04,899 --> 02:32:06,899
Delete them. Patch them out of the game. Instant kill

2484
02:32:06,899 --> 02:32:08,899
moves are fucking stupid. Delete them from the game. Instant kill moves, you should

2485
02:32:08,899 --> 02:32:10,899
never have to put those in the game. They're fucking stupid.

2486
02:32:10,899 --> 02:32:12,899
Nobody likes them. Nobody, not one person likes them.

2487
02:32:12,899 --> 02:32:14,899
Your health is just too low. He doesn't have any instant kill moves.

2488
02:32:14,899 --> 02:32:16,899
Okay.

2489
02:32:16,899 --> 02:32:18,899
If I, if I chop

2490
02:32:18,899 --> 02:32:20,899
you up in a meat grinder, and the

2491
02:32:20,899 --> 02:32:22,899
only thing that comes out that's left of you is your eyeball,

2492
02:32:22,899 --> 02:32:25,399
you're

2493
02:32:25,399 --> 02:32:27,399
you're probably dead.

2494
02:32:27,399 --> 02:32:29,399
You're probably going to

2495
02:32:29,399 --> 02:32:31,399
not you, I'm just saying, like

2496
02:32:31,399 --> 02:32:33,399
I'm not going to put you into a meat grinder.

2497
02:32:33,399 --> 02:32:35,399
I'm not going to put you

2498
02:32:35,399 --> 02:32:37,399
into a meat grinder.

2499
02:32:37,399 --> 02:32:39,399
Okay, we're going to take humans out of this.

2500
02:32:39,399 --> 02:32:41,399
If Alien Glob

2501
02:32:41,399 --> 02:32:43,399
GlobGlobGlobGlob1

2502
02:32:43,399 --> 02:32:45,579
fucking shoots a

2503
02:32:45,579 --> 02:32:47,579
disintegrating ray at Alien

2504
02:32:47,579 --> 02:32:49,579
GlobGlobGlobGlob2

2505
02:32:49,579 --> 02:32:51,819
if there's only fucking teeth

2506
02:32:51,819 --> 02:32:53,819
left, it's, it's fucking

2507
02:32:53,819 --> 02:32:55,819
you're dead. You're dead.

2508
02:32:55,819 --> 02:32:57,819
I've run my dishwasher

2509
02:32:57,819 --> 02:33:00,309
because otherwise it'll get

2510
02:33:00,309 --> 02:33:02,739
gross. I've

2511
02:33:02,739 --> 02:33:05,110
washed by hand.

2512
02:33:05,110 --> 02:33:07,110
I don't like that idea of taking, oh yeah

2513
02:33:07,110 --> 02:33:09,110
there's like a bunch of fucking like saucer

2514
02:33:09,110 --> 02:33:11,110
and like mess on my plate

2515
02:33:11,110 --> 02:33:13,110
just stick it in here and turn the water on.

2516
02:33:13,110 --> 02:33:15,930
No. I don't like the dishwasher. I don't like it.

2517
02:33:15,930 --> 02:33:17,930
And you know why I also don't like the dishwasher?

2518
02:33:17,930 --> 02:33:20,170
All the people question marking me right now.

2519
02:33:20,170 --> 02:33:22,170
So you enjoy

2520
02:33:22,170 --> 02:33:24,170
putting like your dishes in this thing

2521
02:33:24,170 --> 02:33:26,170
and then like for like

2522
02:33:26,170 --> 02:33:28,170
at least one to two fucking

2523
02:33:28,170 --> 02:33:30,170
hours, you hear

2524
02:33:35,290 --> 02:33:38,739
it's fucking obnoxious.

2525
02:33:38,739 --> 02:33:40,739
It's obnoxious. And it lasts for

2526
02:33:40,739 --> 02:33:42,739
an hour. An hour. Two

2527
02:33:42,739 --> 02:33:44,739
fucking hours of this.

2528
02:33:44,739 --> 02:33:46,739
Twenty-three.

2529
02:33:48,739 --> 02:33:50,739
Isn't that a scary number? I like that number. Twenty-three?

2530
02:33:50,739 --> 02:33:52,739
Hold on.

2531
02:33:52,739 --> 02:33:54,739
Scary thriller Jim Carrey

2532
02:33:54,739 --> 02:33:56,739
movie, the number twenty-three

2533
02:33:56,739 --> 02:33:58,739
is not based on

2534
02:33:58,739 --> 02:34:00,739
any actual real like folklore.

2535
02:34:00,739 --> 02:34:02,739
I am not fucking around.

2536
02:34:02,739 --> 02:34:04,739
I'm telling you the absolute honest to god truth.

2537
02:34:04,739 --> 02:34:06,739
I've been afraid of that number since I've heard that movie

2538
02:34:06,739 --> 02:34:08,739
and stuff. I don't know how old was I?

2539
02:34:08,739 --> 02:34:10,739
When did that movie come out?

2540
02:34:10,739 --> 02:34:12,739
Like twenty fucking years ago?

2541
02:34:12,739 --> 02:34:14,739
How old was I? I was probably like

2542
02:34:14,739 --> 02:34:16,739
I don't know. I don't know how old I

2543
02:34:16,739 --> 02:34:18,739
was. I probably was very influenced.

2544
02:34:18,739 --> 02:34:20,739
You were twenty-three.

2545
02:34:20,739 --> 02:34:25,860
What? Two divided by

2546
02:34:25,860 --> 02:34:27,860
three is six six six. That's what

2547
02:34:27,860 --> 02:34:29,860
I'm saying. What do you mean question marks?

2548
02:34:29,860 --> 02:34:32,299
Yeah. It's

2549
02:34:32,299 --> 02:34:34,299
actually biblically accurate scary

2550
02:34:34,299 --> 02:34:36,299
number. I don't want

2551
02:34:36,299 --> 02:34:39,430
the afterlife to be like this. Every

2552
02:34:39,430 --> 02:34:41,430
time people think of the afterlife. Oh heaven.

2553
02:34:41,430 --> 02:34:43,430
Oh my god. I'm moving on. They're

2554
02:34:43,430 --> 02:34:45,430
floating as a specter.

2555
02:34:45,430 --> 02:34:48,059
Oh wow. Look

2556
02:34:48,059 --> 02:34:50,059
at it. So Elizabeth's mist everywhere. Everything's

2557
02:34:50,059 --> 02:34:52,059
misty and you're floating. No

2558
02:34:52,059 --> 02:34:54,059
I don't want it to be like this. I don't want to meet

2559
02:34:54,059 --> 02:34:56,059
the caveman ancestor.

2560
02:34:56,059 --> 02:34:58,420
They're all going to be there.

2561
02:34:58,420 --> 02:35:01,620
I think we all think of like oh

2562
02:35:01,620 --> 02:35:03,620
grandpa and grandpa

2563
02:35:03,620 --> 02:35:05,860
and like Uga

2564
02:35:05,860 --> 02:35:07,860
and Uga

2565
02:35:07,860 --> 02:35:09,860
Uga is going to be there.

2566
02:35:09,860 --> 02:35:11,860
I don't want to go to hell either because guess what?

2567
02:35:11,860 --> 02:35:14,299
You know there's going to be somebody there

2568
02:35:14,299 --> 02:35:16,299
that's going to be like yeah yeah

2569
02:35:16,299 --> 02:35:18,299
it's fine. Everything

2570
02:35:18,299 --> 02:35:20,299
man. I'm glad to be down here. It's like

2571
02:35:20,299 --> 02:35:22,299
I don't want to be with the one

2572
02:35:22,299 --> 02:35:24,299
distant great great great uncle

2573
02:35:24,299 --> 02:35:26,299
that went to hell and hang out with him every

2574
02:35:26,299 --> 02:35:28,299
day. Oh that's going to be fun.

2575
02:35:28,299 --> 02:35:30,299
Guys

2576
02:35:30,299 --> 02:35:32,860
why is there why is there not

2577
02:35:32,860 --> 02:35:35,100
an option?

2578
02:35:35,100 --> 02:35:37,100
Should I even do this? I feel like everyone's waiting

2579
02:35:37,100 --> 02:35:39,100
for me to do this. Okay I'll do it

2580
02:35:39,100 --> 02:35:41,100
in one sentence instead of like

2581
02:35:41,100 --> 02:35:43,100
25 sentences.

2582
02:35:43,100 --> 02:35:45,100
So we're going to do that in one sentence

2583
02:35:45,100 --> 02:35:47,100
instead of doing a 25 sentence explanation of what I

2584
02:35:47,100 --> 02:35:49,100
mean by this. There is no add

2585
02:35:49,100 --> 02:35:51,100
to cart option when you're trying to buy

2586
02:35:51,100 --> 02:35:53,100
shit on Origin

2587
02:35:53,100 --> 02:35:55,100
for the Sims. There's like a hundred things

2588
02:35:55,100 --> 02:35:57,100
to buy individually.

2589
02:35:57,100 --> 02:35:59,100
I got texted by my bank

2590
02:35:59,100 --> 02:36:01,100
hey we've declined purchases. There's like all these

2591
02:36:01,100 --> 02:36:03,100
fraudulent purchases going through the EA

2592
02:36:03,100 --> 02:36:05,100
store. Like no that's me.

2593
02:36:05,100 --> 02:36:07,100
That's me and it's dumb.

2594
02:36:07,100 --> 02:36:09,100
You have to go through the checkout process on each

2595
02:36:09,100 --> 02:36:11,100
individual. Oh

2596
02:36:11,100 --> 02:36:13,100
one sentence. Shit.

2597
02:36:13,100 --> 02:36:15,100
I'm sorry.

2598
02:36:15,100 --> 02:36:24,440
I tend to go off the

2599
02:36:24,440 --> 02:36:27,000
reels and that's not

2600
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
I don't know. I just I get on a

2601
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
topic and I just don't stop.

2602
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
And people clip it and then they send it

2603
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
away. So ladies and

2604
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,370
gentlemen your winner

2605
02:36:37,370 --> 02:36:39,370
for the best rant

2606
02:36:39,370 --> 02:36:41,370
of 2022

2607
02:36:41,370 --> 02:36:47,190
is

2608
02:36:47,190 --> 02:36:50,200
it wasn't even close.

2609
02:36:50,200 --> 02:36:52,200
At 54.7 percent

2610
02:36:52,200 --> 02:36:54,200
55 percent

2611
02:36:54,200 --> 02:36:56,200
is the meat grinder.

2612
02:36:56,200 --> 02:36:58,379
The meat grinder and then

2613
02:36:58,379 --> 02:37:00,379
humans are not supposed to be doing this at 17.6

2614
02:37:00,379 --> 02:37:02,379
alien panic

2615
02:37:02,379 --> 02:37:04,379
at 9.1.

2616
02:37:04,379 --> 02:37:06,620
It wasn't even close.

2617
02:37:06,620 --> 02:37:09,750
Look at the meat. Okay.

2618
02:37:09,750 --> 02:37:11,750
Let me defend myself.

2619
02:37:11,750 --> 02:37:13,750
The meat grinder category

2620
02:37:13,750 --> 02:37:15,750
the meat grinder rant was

2621
02:37:15,750 --> 02:37:18,440
one person

2622
02:37:18,440 --> 02:37:20,440
said something and I was pretending

2623
02:37:20,440 --> 02:37:22,440
like they were

2624
02:37:22,440 --> 02:37:24,440
it's a made up person. Right?

2625
02:37:24,440 --> 02:37:26,440
This person doesn't exist. When I

2626
02:37:26,440 --> 02:37:28,440
say you I'm talking about

2627
02:37:28,440 --> 02:37:30,440
you in general. Not you

2628
02:37:30,440 --> 02:37:32,440
watching right now. You in general.

2629
02:37:32,440 --> 02:37:34,440
You in general.

2630
02:37:34,440 --> 02:37:36,440
It's not. Oh I'm going to put

2631
02:37:36,440 --> 02:37:38,440
you in a meat. No I'm not

2632
02:37:38,440 --> 02:37:40,440
people going to clip that too. So I'm just going to stop

2633
02:37:40,440 --> 02:37:42,440
talking.

2634
02:37:42,440 --> 02:37:44,739
When I say you I mean just you in general

2635
02:37:44,739 --> 02:37:46,739
just you. Oh you know

2636
02:37:46,739 --> 02:37:48,739
if I put you into a meat grinder I'm

2637
02:37:48,739 --> 02:37:50,739
not saying you individual. You get it. You

2638
02:37:50,739 --> 02:37:53,110
understand. Moving right along

2639
02:37:53,110 --> 02:37:55,860
now here come the juicy

2640
02:37:55,860 --> 02:37:59,059
ones. These are the juicy

2641
02:37:59,059 --> 02:38:01,500
ones. There's so many categories left

2642
02:38:01,500 --> 02:38:04,379
we just get started. I tend

2643
02:38:04,379 --> 02:38:06,549
to do impressions and

2644
02:38:06,549 --> 02:38:08,549
some of them are very good

2645
02:38:08,549 --> 02:38:10,549
some of them are very bad. I think some of my impressions are

2646
02:38:10,549 --> 02:38:12,549
good. Although people would tell

2647
02:38:12,549 --> 02:38:14,549
me to do your impressions your impressions are terrible.

2648
02:38:14,549 --> 02:38:16,549
So we'll start with

2649
02:38:16,549 --> 02:38:18,549
the best we'll go to the worst after. This

2650
02:38:18,549 --> 02:38:20,549
is the best impressions.

2651
02:38:20,549 --> 02:38:23,049
I think I did a pretty

2652
02:38:23,049 --> 02:38:25,930
good job this year. This category

2653
02:38:25,930 --> 02:38:27,930
I mean people are doing that emote and I can see it.

2654
02:38:27,930 --> 02:38:29,930
The like blah blah blah blah blah my head is bobbing

2655
02:38:29,930 --> 02:38:31,930
around. Whatever.

2656
02:38:31,930 --> 02:38:33,930
You guys know what I mean when I say that shit though

2657
02:38:33,930 --> 02:38:35,969
All right, you have to.

2658
02:38:35,969 --> 02:38:38,530
I told Santa I wouldn't swear.

2659
02:38:38,530 --> 02:38:41,700
So I'm gonna say, what the shoot.

2660
02:38:41,700 --> 02:38:46,780
So here are your nominees for best impression of the year.

2661
02:38:46,780 --> 02:38:53,540
These are the good ones.

2662
02:38:53,540 --> 02:38:54,860
At least I hope they are.

2663
02:38:54,860 --> 02:38:57,860
Now, make haste to the tower and defeat the evil wizards.

2664
02:39:00,620 --> 02:39:01,700
Mermaid man.

2665
02:39:03,219 --> 02:39:04,379
Evil wizards.

2666
02:39:04,379 --> 02:39:05,459
Evil wizards.

2667
02:39:07,139 --> 02:39:12,139
No, we need to get into the boat and go get them, SpongeBob.

2668
02:39:14,579 --> 02:39:17,219
What are you doing, you old moron?

2669
02:39:17,219 --> 02:39:22,219
I am trying to do what it is a superhero must be doing.

2670
02:39:23,780 --> 02:39:25,180
Getting to the bank.

2671
02:39:26,139 --> 02:39:30,059
And who could forget getting it off there?

2672
02:39:30,059 --> 02:39:36,149
The all-knowing, there he is.

2673
02:39:36,149 --> 02:39:41,139
You drink?

2674
02:39:41,139 --> 02:39:45,450
The orange-blue chieftain of the Badlands.

2675
02:39:45,450 --> 02:39:49,989
The ever-knowing gold man.

2676
02:39:49,989 --> 02:39:53,540
The disgusting dung eater.

2677
02:39:53,540 --> 02:39:58,540
And of course, there's Sir Gideon up there.

2678
02:39:58,540 --> 02:40:01,819
The all-knowing, what's happening, my friend?

2679
02:40:01,819 --> 02:40:03,700
I would have voted for that one.

2680
02:40:03,700 --> 02:40:08,700
Meat, potatoes, and lettuce and fucking gravy.

2681
02:40:13,389 --> 02:40:18,370
Spinach and radishes.

2682
02:40:18,370 --> 02:40:21,500
And I'm alive and I'm human.

2683
02:40:21,500 --> 02:40:24,180
I like to eat, too.

2684
02:40:24,180 --> 02:40:26,020
And I like to have children.

2685
02:40:26,020 --> 02:40:28,379
I'm here and I'm coming.

2686
02:40:28,379 --> 02:40:31,450
I'm here and I'm coming.

2687
02:40:31,450 --> 02:40:33,409
It's like, oh, Perry the Paratapus,

2688
02:40:33,409 --> 02:40:36,090
I'm going to take over the entire world, Perry.

2689
02:40:36,090 --> 02:40:37,290
No, it's me, Dolphins.

2690
02:40:37,290 --> 02:40:38,649
But that was actually really, really good

2691
02:40:38,649 --> 02:40:39,969
and I would say that was probably the best one

2692
02:40:39,969 --> 02:40:41,649
you've heard anybody do.

2693
02:40:41,649 --> 02:40:44,250
Not showing anything under arrest.

2694
02:40:44,250 --> 02:40:47,700
I'm underwater?

2695
02:40:47,700 --> 02:40:52,700
Gentlemen, this is tobacco receive manifest.

2696
02:40:53,540 --> 02:40:54,379
Ever.

2697
02:40:54,379 --> 02:40:56,700
Look at that headlock there, see?

2698
02:40:56,700 --> 02:40:58,379
That chap over there joined.

2699
02:40:58,379 --> 02:41:02,059
Or by pay us this, is the local got me on the penis.

2700
02:41:02,059 --> 02:41:02,899
Before.

2701
02:41:02,899 --> 02:41:03,860
That's one voice.

2702
02:41:03,860 --> 02:41:05,700
Who's a pretty bird?

2703
02:41:08,670 --> 02:41:16,440
Who's a pretty bird?

2704
02:41:16,440 --> 02:41:18,200
Who wants a kiss?

2705
02:41:18,200 --> 02:41:19,520
Who wants a kiss?

2706
02:41:21,239 --> 02:41:22,440
Tom Scott.

2707
02:41:22,440 --> 02:41:23,959
This water is electrified.

2708
02:41:24,959 --> 02:41:28,500
It will kill you if you stand within five feet of it.

2709
02:41:28,500 --> 02:41:35,420
Meow, meow, oh, Bowser.

2710
02:41:35,420 --> 02:41:36,459
Ah, annoying.

2711
02:41:36,459 --> 02:41:41,559
Oh, boys and girls, it's a me, Mario.

2712
02:41:41,559 --> 02:41:43,500
Let me tell you something.

2713
02:41:43,500 --> 02:41:48,500
If somebody want to tell you to take drugs, always say no.

2714
02:41:48,700 --> 02:41:52,979
You see, Luigi tried to drink and do drugs one time

2715
02:41:52,979 --> 02:41:54,500
and I said, no.

2716
02:41:54,500 --> 02:41:55,739
And he said, Mario.

2717
02:41:55,739 --> 02:41:57,459
And I said, no.

2718
02:41:58,219 --> 02:41:59,780
Fucking God damn it.

2719
02:42:07,299 --> 02:42:11,219
And that's the bottom line, because Stone Cold said so.

2720
02:42:11,219 --> 02:42:12,540
Pretty good.

2721
02:42:12,540 --> 02:42:14,100
They're eating her.

2722
02:42:14,100 --> 02:42:16,950
And then they're going to eat me.

2723
02:42:16,950 --> 02:42:21,309
Oh my God.

2724
02:42:21,309 --> 02:42:24,549
Please, can you do a quick Seinfeld routine

2725
02:42:24,549 --> 02:42:29,360
about the word vast?

2726
02:42:29,360 --> 02:42:30,200
What even is vast?

2727
02:42:30,200 --> 02:42:31,040
What's that supposed to mean?

2728
02:42:31,040 --> 02:42:32,319
Vast.

2729
02:42:32,319 --> 02:42:33,319
Just say big.

2730
02:42:33,319 --> 02:42:34,559
Just say large.

2731
02:42:34,559 --> 02:42:37,459
Say big.

2732
02:42:37,459 --> 02:42:38,940
Why do we need names for so,

2733
02:42:38,940 --> 02:42:40,459
why do we have so many names to describe

2734
02:42:40,459 --> 02:42:41,979
what is effectively big?

2735
02:42:49,040 --> 02:42:54,649
I mean, if you want my vote, I'm voting for Alex Jones.

2736
02:42:54,649 --> 02:42:55,729
I don't think anybody does it.

2737
02:42:55,729 --> 02:42:57,329
Alex Jones, like, I can't.

2738
02:42:57,329 --> 02:43:00,200
I just, I gotta be really honest.

2739
02:43:00,200 --> 02:43:04,559
Find me somebody that can do that as good as I can.

2740
02:43:04,559 --> 02:43:06,159
People usually, you know, they go like this.

2741
02:43:06,159 --> 02:43:07,319
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2742
02:43:07,319 --> 02:43:10,309
Find me somebody that can do that better than me.

2743
02:43:10,309 --> 02:43:11,950
I don't think you can.

2744
02:43:11,950 --> 02:43:15,299
That's my vote, that's what I voted for.

2745
02:43:16,100 --> 02:43:19,520
But your winner of the best impression of the year is,

2746
02:43:23,500 --> 02:43:26,739
of course, it's Alpenny the Platypus, Doof and Schmertz.

2747
02:43:26,739 --> 02:43:29,860
With 30% of the vote, that's a high one,

2748
02:43:29,860 --> 02:43:32,440
then Alex Jones right behind it.

2749
02:43:32,440 --> 02:43:35,120
16.8, not right behind it, pretty far.

2750
02:43:36,399 --> 02:43:38,760
Doof and Schmertz, Alex Jones, Doof and Schmertz.

2751
02:43:38,760 --> 02:43:40,120
It's a hard word to say.

2752
02:43:40,120 --> 02:43:45,120
And then democracy manifests subtitles at 12.3%.

2753
02:43:47,840 --> 02:43:50,729
Doof and Schmertz takes it.

2754
02:43:50,770 --> 02:43:52,010
I think I can do a pretty good job.

2755
02:43:52,010 --> 02:43:57,889
And now, obviously, I do a lot of these every year.

2756
02:43:59,440 --> 02:44:02,680
And we're not just gonna talk about the good ones.

2757
02:44:02,680 --> 02:44:05,239
We're gonna talk about the bad ones.

2758
02:44:05,239 --> 02:44:08,979
This is the worst impression of the year.

2759
02:44:08,979 --> 02:44:12,379
I don't agree with some of these.

2760
02:44:12,379 --> 02:44:13,700
Let's be real.

2761
02:44:13,700 --> 02:44:15,620
I don't agree with some of these.

2762
02:44:15,620 --> 02:44:18,420
Some of these are a little, I don't like that character,

2763
02:44:18,420 --> 02:44:20,020
so I'm just gonna nominate it.

2764
02:44:20,020 --> 02:44:22,629
That's not how this works.

2765
02:44:22,629 --> 02:44:25,270
But just like the bad ones, they're also good ones,

2766
02:44:25,270 --> 02:44:27,139
and what you just saw.

2767
02:44:27,139 --> 02:44:28,379
Here are your nominees

2768
02:44:28,379 --> 02:44:30,579
for the worst impression of the entire year.

2769
02:44:39,319 --> 02:44:40,760
Did you do Jack Sparrow?

2770
02:44:40,760 --> 02:44:42,120
I don't know what that sounds like.

2771
02:44:42,120 --> 02:44:44,159
Fuck, I'm done.

2772
02:44:44,159 --> 02:44:45,120
But my career is over.

2773
02:44:45,120 --> 02:44:46,280
I'm ending my career.

2774
02:44:46,280 --> 02:44:47,360
It's over today.

2775
02:44:47,360 --> 02:44:49,739
Okay, so I got a letter.

2776
02:44:49,739 --> 02:44:52,340
Jerry, when you read this letter,

2777
02:44:52,340 --> 02:44:54,940
I will already be on the other side of the world.

2778
02:44:54,940 --> 02:44:56,379
I'm sorry about that.

2779
02:44:56,379 --> 02:44:59,020
I'm sorry that I'm not the father you wanted me to be.

2780
02:44:59,020 --> 02:45:00,819
The rest is up to you.

2781
02:45:00,819 --> 02:45:03,299
Do your best and live a wonderful life.

2782
02:45:03,299 --> 02:45:04,260
You always will.

2783
02:45:06,340 --> 02:45:07,899
That's the worst George I've ever heard.

2784
02:45:07,899 --> 02:45:08,739
It's really not.

2785
02:45:08,739 --> 02:45:09,739
That's what I mean.

2786
02:45:09,739 --> 02:45:11,739
It's Gilbert Coffrey.

2787
02:45:11,739 --> 02:45:15,180
Hey, when I'm told I've been looking forward

2788
02:45:15,180 --> 02:45:17,500
to this for quite a long time.

2789
02:45:17,500 --> 02:45:20,219
Alpha's more popular than ever in the Mushroom Kingdom.

2790
02:45:20,219 --> 02:45:22,340
Wasn't that tourney yesterday incredible?

2791
02:45:24,209 --> 02:45:26,370
But if we want to keep the sport interesting,

2792
02:45:26,370 --> 02:45:28,170
we need some green players, you see.

2793
02:45:29,989 --> 02:45:32,909
Man, just show me folks who can hit the green.

2794
02:45:32,909 --> 02:45:34,229
Oh, whoa, wait.

2795
02:45:34,229 --> 02:45:35,069
That's not even that bad.

2796
02:45:35,069 --> 02:45:35,909
It really isn't. That's crazy.

2797
02:45:35,909 --> 02:45:38,069
That's all I had to do was like just clear my throat.

2798
02:45:38,069 --> 02:45:44,129
We need some fresh faces on the leaderboard.

2799
02:45:44,129 --> 02:45:45,969
Okay.

2800
02:45:45,969 --> 02:45:49,700
That was bad. That was a really bad.

2801
02:45:49,700 --> 02:45:52,260
I don't know if that was Toad or,

2802
02:45:52,260 --> 02:45:53,260
I don't know what game that was from,

2803
02:45:53,260 --> 02:45:54,659
but it was a bad impression.

2804
02:45:56,540 --> 02:46:01,540
Ooh, Skywalker, I must say, are you, are you?

2805
02:46:01,899 --> 02:46:03,340
Is that bad?

2806
02:46:03,340 --> 02:46:05,700
It really was one word elongated.

2807
02:46:05,700 --> 02:46:06,540
Wow.

2808
02:46:08,540 --> 02:46:10,659
You sound like the sweetest chef.

2809
02:46:10,659 --> 02:46:12,020
You have a Bobby Hill impression?

2810
02:46:12,020 --> 02:46:12,860
I'll try.

2811
02:46:13,860 --> 02:46:15,620
Yeah.

2812
02:46:15,620 --> 02:46:17,139
Hey, Dad, I'm sorry.

2813
02:46:17,139 --> 02:46:19,420
I can't, but I tried.

2814
02:46:19,420 --> 02:46:23,159
What does Cookie Monster sound like?

2815
02:46:23,159 --> 02:46:24,840
It's like, what does it sound like?

2816
02:46:24,840 --> 02:46:25,760
It's kind of like.

2817
02:46:31,899 --> 02:46:33,540
Cookies.

2818
02:46:33,540 --> 02:46:35,100
I love cookies, right?

2819
02:46:35,100 --> 02:46:36,219
Something like that.

2820
02:46:36,219 --> 02:46:37,059
Let me try it.

2821
02:46:37,059 --> 02:46:41,299
Let me go all in with it and see what happens.

2822
02:46:41,299 --> 02:46:43,459
This cookie is delicious.

2823
02:46:43,459 --> 02:46:44,860
I love cookies.

2824
02:46:44,860 --> 02:46:45,700
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

2825
02:46:45,700 --> 02:46:46,659
There's the heavy from TF2.

2826
02:46:46,659 --> 02:46:47,700
Oh, yes, cookies.

2827
02:46:47,700 --> 02:46:49,739
That's not, that's not really, really not that good.

2828
02:46:49,739 --> 02:46:52,459
But I mean, it's, how do you even do it?

2829
02:46:52,459 --> 02:46:54,280
Let me try to do a dog.

2830
02:46:54,280 --> 02:46:57,680
Oh, Morty, we gotta be careful.

2831
02:46:57,680 --> 02:46:59,690
Put that back in there and we're gonna go back,

2832
02:46:59,690 --> 02:47:00,889
back in time to shave.

2833
02:47:00,889 --> 02:47:01,930
Actually, it is different.

2834
02:47:01,930 --> 02:47:06,600
Morty, Morty, we gotta be careful.

2835
02:47:06,600 --> 02:47:07,760
Guys, I've never seen all these movies.

2836
02:47:07,760 --> 02:47:08,639
I've never seen them.

2837
02:47:08,639 --> 02:47:09,959
I just know, I know Christopher Lloyd,

2838
02:47:09,959 --> 02:47:14,100
Christopher Lloyd, right?

2839
02:47:14,100 --> 02:47:15,540
His name's Morty, not Marty.

2840
02:47:15,540 --> 02:47:17,379
Marty, not, what?

2841
02:47:17,379 --> 02:47:18,899
Oh, I just dropped everything.

2842
02:47:18,899 --> 02:47:20,659
Do a Taz impression.

2843
02:47:20,659 --> 02:47:23,930
No, no, no, sponsor stream.

2844
02:47:23,930 --> 02:47:25,409
Ah, whatever, why not?

2845
02:47:38,940 --> 02:47:42,309
I was just about, okay, that Taz,

2846
02:47:42,309 --> 02:47:44,790
Taz Mania was just about to do that.

2847
02:47:44,790 --> 02:47:46,469
Somebody like hitman style,

2848
02:47:46,469 --> 02:47:51,590
like put a fucking piano wire on his neck.

2849
02:47:51,670 --> 02:47:54,459
Patrick?

2850
02:47:54,459 --> 02:47:57,950
Hey, SpongeBob, it's me, Patrick.

2851
02:47:57,950 --> 02:48:01,389
Oh yeah, SpongeBob, let's go have an adventure.

2852
02:48:01,389 --> 02:48:02,829
What was wrong with this one?

2853
02:48:02,829 --> 02:48:03,909
Does that sound like him, kind of?

2854
02:48:03,909 --> 02:48:04,750
Yeah, it does.

2855
02:48:04,750 --> 02:48:05,590
Why was it on here?

2856
02:48:08,340 --> 02:48:09,739
Enjoy yourself.

2857
02:48:09,739 --> 02:48:10,579
No.

2858
02:48:11,760 --> 02:48:13,959
It's this wide, strange world.

2859
02:48:14,840 --> 02:48:18,120
This realm has a way of getting right in the end.

2860
02:48:18,120 --> 02:48:18,959
What?

2861
02:48:20,799 --> 02:48:22,319
Okay, this one sucks.

2862
02:48:22,319 --> 02:48:23,280
This one sucks.

2863
02:48:23,280 --> 02:48:24,120
I like it.

2864
02:48:24,120 --> 02:48:24,959
This is bad.

2865
02:48:25,559 --> 02:48:28,399
I will be expecting many great things from you.

2866
02:48:29,719 --> 02:48:34,719
It will get hotter in ways you might not be able to imagine.

2867
02:48:35,159 --> 02:48:36,520
Geez, this one's the worst.

2868
02:48:36,520 --> 02:48:38,979
Does this win?

2869
02:48:38,979 --> 02:48:40,340
Voice is bad, voice is bad.

2870
02:48:40,340 --> 02:48:41,579
Shitty voice, worst voice.

2871
02:48:41,579 --> 02:48:42,420
Does that win?

2872
02:48:48,659 --> 02:48:51,829
You want my vote, it's that one.

2873
02:48:51,829 --> 02:48:56,979
Look, okay, you have to, I am live.

2874
02:48:56,979 --> 02:48:59,379
I don't know how many hours a year,

2875
02:48:59,379 --> 02:49:01,540
but if I'm gonna do an impression,

2876
02:49:01,540 --> 02:49:04,540
sometimes you get shitty ones, sometimes you get duds.

2877
02:49:04,540 --> 02:49:06,299
I don't think the George was bad.

2878
02:49:07,989 --> 02:49:10,629
Why that George Costanza was so bad, Jerry.

2879
02:49:10,629 --> 02:49:11,629
How?

2880
02:49:11,629 --> 02:49:14,389
Why would that be nominated that many times?

2881
02:49:14,389 --> 02:49:17,479
I think that one was fine.

2882
02:49:17,479 --> 02:49:19,239
Why was that so bad?

2883
02:49:19,239 --> 02:49:21,559
Question marks, that sucked.

2884
02:49:21,559 --> 02:49:22,920
Was it that bad?

2885
02:49:22,920 --> 02:49:23,840
I don't think it was.

2886
02:49:23,840 --> 02:49:26,979
I think you're mistaken here.

2887
02:49:26,979 --> 02:49:27,819
They were all bad.

2888
02:49:27,819 --> 02:49:28,899
The frog one definitely won.

2889
02:49:28,899 --> 02:49:30,020
If it didn't, then there's something wrong

2890
02:49:30,020 --> 02:49:31,260
with this community.

2891
02:49:31,260 --> 02:49:33,899
Ladies and gentlemen, your winner of Worst Impression

2892
02:49:34,540 --> 02:49:38,340
of the entire year is, what the fuck?

2893
02:49:39,219 --> 02:49:42,059
It's not even in the top three.

2894
02:49:42,059 --> 02:49:47,040
Toad was 23.2% of the vote.

2895
02:49:47,040 --> 02:49:49,840
And then Jack Sparrow at 18.9,

2896
02:49:49,840 --> 02:49:55,659
and then Patrick Starr at 10.9%, one, two, and three.

2897
02:49:55,979 --> 02:49:58,940
What?

2898
02:49:58,940 --> 02:50:00,420
That frog was so bad.

2899
02:50:00,420 --> 02:50:04,930
How was that not at like 80% of the vote?

2900
02:50:04,930 --> 02:50:10,409
All right, time for the meaty categories.

2901
02:50:10,409 --> 02:50:13,750
These are the ones that are full of flavor.

2902
02:50:13,750 --> 02:50:15,750
I'm gonna take my time with these because I,

2903
02:50:15,750 --> 02:50:18,690
this is my ego stroke here.

2904
02:50:18,690 --> 02:50:24,379
It's time for an ego stroke until this one, but you know.

2905
02:50:24,420 --> 02:50:27,860
This next category is one that hits very deep to me,

2906
02:50:27,860 --> 02:50:30,420
and probably to those of you watching.

2907
02:50:30,420 --> 02:50:32,780
This is for the best joke

2908
02:50:32,780 --> 02:50:35,420
taking more than five minutes to set up.

2909
02:50:35,420 --> 02:50:38,620
And what that means is that anything that took

2910
02:50:38,620 --> 02:50:42,340
at least a few minutes to get rolling, okay?

2911
02:50:42,739 --> 02:50:44,860
At least a few minutes to get rolling.

2912
02:50:44,860 --> 02:50:46,739
So there were a lot of nominees,

2913
02:50:46,739 --> 02:50:49,780
a lot of good ones that I think, and you're swearing.

2914
02:50:49,780 --> 02:50:52,500
Santa is already across the globe right now.

2915
02:50:52,500 --> 02:50:55,979
He's a very busy person, so it'll be a very busy man.

2916
02:50:55,979 --> 02:50:59,760
Ladies and gentlemen, here are your nominees

2917
02:50:59,760 --> 02:51:02,079
for the best joke of the year

2918
02:51:02,079 --> 02:51:06,319
taking more than five minutes to set up.

2919
02:51:06,319 --> 02:51:12,250
Toad wasn't even bad, stop.

2920
02:51:12,250 --> 02:51:14,290
I think that would add some atmosphere

2921
02:51:14,290 --> 02:51:16,489
if like after every major kind of area,

2922
02:51:16,489 --> 02:51:18,129
and every puzzle was like music played,

2923
02:51:18,129 --> 02:51:19,409
and you just heard.

2924
02:51:19,409 --> 02:51:21,290
Scorn.

2925
02:51:21,290 --> 02:51:22,729
Have a kind of cool leg.

2926
02:51:22,729 --> 02:51:23,770
Jesus.

2927
02:51:23,770 --> 02:51:26,209
Oh, what the fuck?

2928
02:51:26,209 --> 02:51:27,649
Scorn.

2929
02:51:27,649 --> 02:51:29,450
Blood.

2930
02:51:29,450 --> 02:51:31,090
Lots of fucking blood.

2931
02:51:31,090 --> 02:51:32,329
Lots of blood.

2932
02:51:32,329 --> 02:51:33,969
That's a lot of blood.

2933
02:51:33,969 --> 02:51:35,909
Scorn.

2934
02:51:35,909 --> 02:51:38,639
I have to be better at fucking acting.

2935
02:51:38,639 --> 02:51:42,409
True.

2936
02:51:42,409 --> 02:51:43,250
Scorn.

2937
02:51:45,139 --> 02:51:53,100
I'm sorry, I can't do it.

2938
02:51:53,100 --> 02:51:55,950
Scorn.

2939
02:51:55,950 --> 02:51:57,950
I look like a different person.

2940
02:51:57,950 --> 02:52:00,149
Leave it on so the Twitch thumbnail gets it.

2941
02:52:01,260 --> 02:52:02,299
All right, fine.

2942
02:52:02,299 --> 02:52:03,940
Make this the thumbnail.

2943
02:52:03,940 --> 02:52:08,540
No, dude, I...

2944
02:52:08,540 --> 02:52:09,659
It's so fucked up.

2945
02:52:09,659 --> 02:52:11,540
This is fucking insane.

2946
02:52:11,540 --> 02:52:13,540
I think we're going a little too far.

2947
02:52:13,540 --> 02:52:14,860
I think we're going too far.

2948
02:52:14,860 --> 02:52:16,500
Okay, are you ready for the culmination

2949
02:52:16,500 --> 02:52:19,420
of what is the thumbnail right now?

2950
02:52:19,420 --> 02:52:21,659
Here you go.

2951
02:52:21,659 --> 02:52:27,379
Welcome to hell.

2952
02:52:27,379 --> 02:52:28,379
Now listen, buster.

2953
02:52:30,579 --> 02:52:32,790
Once we get down here,

2954
02:52:32,790 --> 02:52:34,709
I'm gonna make sure that we take care of this

2955
02:52:34,709 --> 02:52:37,200
as soon as possible.

2956
02:52:37,200 --> 02:52:40,479
Now, I don't get that move at all.

2957
02:52:40,520 --> 02:52:43,600
That move is absolutely unbelievable.

2958
02:52:43,600 --> 02:52:45,559
It's one of those moves that you can't do anything about.

2959
02:52:45,559 --> 02:52:48,079
And I'm telling you, yeah.

2960
02:52:48,079 --> 02:52:50,819
But you know what else ridiculous is that?

2961
02:52:50,819 --> 02:52:51,659
Playing soon.

2962
02:52:51,659 --> 02:52:55,030
They're gonna be like, I can fly eventually too.

2963
02:52:55,030 --> 02:52:57,510
How many fucking moves do you get before you...

2964
02:52:57,510 --> 02:52:58,510
I'm sorry about that, folks,

2965
02:52:58,510 --> 02:52:59,950
but what I meant to say was,

2966
02:52:59,950 --> 02:53:01,389
how many moves do you get to do in a row

2967
02:53:01,389 --> 02:53:03,950
before gosh darn it, you...

2968
02:53:03,950 --> 02:53:05,549
How many moves do you get to do gosh darn it

2969
02:53:05,549 --> 02:53:07,389
before fucking wrong thing?

2970
02:53:07,389 --> 02:53:08,510
Wrong thing.

2971
02:53:08,510 --> 02:53:11,319
All right, here we go.

2972
02:53:11,319 --> 02:53:12,280
I made the medic.

2973
02:53:12,280 --> 02:53:13,239
I'm good to go.

2974
02:53:24,079 --> 02:53:26,079
Do I need to be killing these people?

2975
02:53:38,440 --> 02:53:39,479
I'm not eating bugs.

2976
02:53:39,479 --> 02:53:43,760
I wouldn't eat bugs if my mother asked me to.

2977
02:53:43,760 --> 02:53:45,120
What about a doctor?

2978
02:53:45,120 --> 02:53:48,540
I don't know, what does the doctor look like?

2979
02:53:48,540 --> 02:53:53,540
Is he six feet tall, 200, lean cut?

2980
02:53:54,500 --> 02:53:55,340
What does he look like?

2981
02:53:55,340 --> 02:53:58,299
And he's so fit, he just got done cycling

2982
02:53:58,299 --> 02:54:01,340
and he's got cycling shorts on and a lab coat.

2983
02:54:01,819 --> 02:54:03,899
Stop sharing your fantasy.

2984
02:54:05,979 --> 02:54:09,620
Just got done with a quick bike ride.

2985
02:54:09,620 --> 02:54:12,780
Kickstand, comes in, just like sweat,

2986
02:54:12,780 --> 02:54:14,379
just glistening off his forehead.

2987
02:54:16,180 --> 02:54:18,639
So, what brings you in today?

2988
02:54:18,639 --> 02:54:20,280
And I'm like, oh wow, look at that,

2989
02:54:20,280 --> 02:54:23,200
crazy, that's why you got that, what a head of hair.

2990
02:54:23,200 --> 02:54:31,379
Yeah, haven't had a headache, by the way, in a long time.

2991
02:54:31,379 --> 02:54:36,370
Different music.

2992
02:54:36,370 --> 02:54:39,219
You wanna eat some bugs?

2993
02:54:39,219 --> 02:54:40,579
We're watching you in a bar, German,

2994
02:54:40,620 --> 02:54:42,770
you wanna do something wacky?

2995
02:54:42,770 --> 02:54:45,879
I like this one.

2996
02:54:45,879 --> 02:54:50,409
Hey, this one goes out to all y'all in the bar.

2997
02:54:50,409 --> 02:54:58,100
Hey, three, two, one, let's go.

2998
02:54:58,100 --> 02:55:00,809
Mm, green tea.

2999
02:55:00,809 --> 02:55:03,129
They can't even hear me.

3000
02:55:03,129 --> 02:55:04,409
Should I try to communicate?

3001
02:55:04,409 --> 02:55:08,819
Hey, you, wait, look.

3002
02:55:08,819 --> 02:55:12,090
Hey, everybody, hey.

3003
02:55:12,090 --> 02:55:14,409
I was on screen at a bar, for those back there

3004
02:55:14,409 --> 02:55:15,809
that don't know what's going on.

3005
02:55:17,659 --> 02:55:20,930
I was typing and shit.

3006
02:55:20,930 --> 02:55:22,409
Yeah!

3007
02:55:22,409 --> 02:55:26,840
What about a Twitch moment badge for longest stream?

3008
02:55:26,840 --> 02:55:28,079
Wait, can I do that?

3009
02:55:28,079 --> 02:55:31,159
You were here for the longest stream

3010
02:55:31,159 --> 02:55:33,280
I've ever done on this channel.

3011
02:55:33,280 --> 02:55:38,670
13 hours, 19 minutes, and 41 seconds.

3012
02:55:38,670 --> 02:55:39,950
Ain't ever gonna happen again.

3013
02:55:39,950 --> 02:55:41,030
Should I do another moment?

3014
02:55:41,030 --> 02:55:42,030
It's not, ever.

3015
02:55:46,909 --> 02:55:48,989
Like the 200 people that just left?

3016
02:55:48,989 --> 02:55:50,030
You fucked up.

3017
02:55:50,030 --> 02:55:54,190
13 hours, 27 minutes, and six seconds.

3018
02:55:54,190 --> 02:55:56,709
I think that deserves a quick bite of pizza.

3019
02:55:59,100 --> 02:56:02,170
Hey, man, I can't believe you made it.

3020
02:56:02,170 --> 02:56:03,010
Was I on drugs?

3021
02:56:03,010 --> 02:56:03,850
Like, what was I doing here?

3022
02:56:03,850 --> 02:56:07,250
13 hours, 36 minutes, and 52 seconds.

3023
02:56:07,250 --> 02:56:08,569
God, man, I can't believe.

3024
02:56:08,569 --> 02:56:09,409
You were here.

3025
02:56:09,409 --> 02:56:19,190
Don't ever call the sus guy at 3 a.m.

3026
02:56:19,190 --> 02:56:20,110
Hey, dude, can you speak up?

3027
02:56:20,110 --> 02:56:22,739
I'm in a construction site.

3028
02:56:22,739 --> 02:56:24,100
I would vote for this one.

3029
02:56:24,100 --> 02:56:24,940
I love this one.

3030
02:56:29,319 --> 02:56:30,159
Okay, hold on.

3031
02:56:35,479 --> 02:56:37,459
Why would you even go live?

3032
02:56:37,459 --> 02:56:38,420
Just wait till tomorrow.

3033
02:56:38,979 --> 02:56:39,819
Like, who cares?

3034
02:56:39,819 --> 02:57:03,059
Fucking keep your stream off.

3035
02:57:03,059 --> 02:57:03,899
Okay.

3036
02:57:06,930 --> 02:57:09,010
What the fuck?

3037
02:57:09,010 --> 02:57:10,889
What am I supposed to do?

3038
02:57:10,889 --> 02:57:12,969
Guys, what does that mean?

3039
02:57:12,969 --> 02:57:16,659
Whoa, a guy.

3040
02:57:16,659 --> 02:57:17,500
Hold on, watch out.

3041
02:57:17,500 --> 02:57:21,940
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

3042
02:57:21,940 --> 02:57:23,340
I gotta get this kill.

3043
02:57:23,340 --> 02:57:25,819
Gotta get this kill, gotta get this kill.

3044
02:57:25,819 --> 02:57:27,579
Oh, I died.

3045
02:57:29,649 --> 02:57:30,649
Shoot.

3046
02:57:30,649 --> 02:57:31,489
What if I just like,

3047
02:57:31,489 --> 02:57:32,930
ready to fall asleep on stream?

3048
02:57:33,770 --> 02:57:37,610
All right, I'm gonna pretend to fall asleep on stream.

3049
02:57:37,610 --> 02:57:39,450
I think this is in both categories, by the way.

3050
02:57:39,450 --> 02:57:40,850
Dude, wicked fucking tired.

3051
02:57:40,850 --> 02:57:42,649
Like, had a long day.

3052
02:57:42,649 --> 02:57:43,690
I hope it wins both.

3053
02:57:45,010 --> 02:57:47,129
And then you're woken up by the jump scare.

3054
02:57:47,129 --> 02:57:50,770
It might be a good idea to make sure

3055
02:57:50,770 --> 02:57:53,840
everyone's in a proper place.

3056
02:57:53,840 --> 02:58:00,379
Interestingly enough, you guys made it really awesome.

3057
02:58:00,379 --> 02:58:06,350
Fuck.

3058
02:58:06,350 --> 02:58:08,430
Yeah, yeah.

3059
02:58:08,430 --> 02:58:10,069
So, speaking of which.

3060
02:58:10,069 --> 02:58:10,909
Such a bad payoff.

3061
02:58:10,909 --> 02:58:11,870
I am a new man.

3062
02:58:11,870 --> 02:58:14,110
I'm here to do something that I said

3063
02:58:14,270 --> 02:58:17,790
I would never do, and that's to play Destiny 2.

3064
02:58:17,790 --> 02:58:18,629
I love this part where he says the doctor.

3065
02:58:18,629 --> 02:58:20,590
I know, I said I'd never do it.

3066
02:58:20,590 --> 02:58:21,590
But here we are.

3067
02:58:21,590 --> 02:58:22,549
Shpee.

3068
02:58:24,329 --> 02:58:25,649
That's the Shpee Ship.

3069
02:58:26,569 --> 02:58:29,090
We're taking the Shpee Ship to war.

3070
02:58:29,090 --> 02:58:32,770
You're, you're, you took everything from me,

3071
02:58:32,770 --> 02:58:35,290
even though it's really actually not that bad of a character.

3072
02:58:35,290 --> 02:58:38,170
And I'm gonna, I'm gonna haunt you for the rest of your life.

3073
02:58:38,170 --> 02:58:40,049
You better run, and you better never,

3074
02:58:40,049 --> 02:58:41,329
you better never look back.

3075
02:58:41,329 --> 02:58:42,729
Is this Scooby-Doo Van?

3076
02:58:43,569 --> 02:58:46,690
Is this the mystery machine?

3077
02:58:57,159 --> 02:58:58,159
It's too dark.

3078
02:59:23,139 --> 02:59:27,760
Well, that was quite a year.

3079
02:59:27,760 --> 02:59:32,760
Those are your top jokes voted by you, nominated by you.

3080
02:59:34,139 --> 02:59:34,979
Let's find out.

3081
02:59:34,979 --> 02:59:36,940
Sorry, I just punched you.

3082
02:59:36,940 --> 02:59:38,899
Can I get some of this off my face too?

3083
02:59:38,899 --> 02:59:41,049
This is gonna be permanent.

3084
02:59:41,049 --> 02:59:41,889
I just did it again.

3085
02:59:41,889 --> 02:59:45,180
What the hell am I doing?

3086
02:59:45,180 --> 02:59:48,420
Ladies and gentlemen, the best joke of the year.

3087
02:59:48,420 --> 02:59:51,459
Taking more than five minutes to set up is,

3088
02:59:53,600 --> 02:59:57,739
oh, it's an upset.

3089
02:59:57,739 --> 02:59:59,540
It's an upset.

3090
02:59:59,540 --> 03:00:03,079
This is an upset.

3091
03:00:03,079 --> 03:00:08,079
With 25% of the vote, 25%, the ultimate thumbnail.

3092
03:00:12,110 --> 03:00:14,270
The huge thumbnail wins.

3093
03:00:14,270 --> 03:00:19,959
And then scorn, far away at 12.6% of the vote, far away.

3094
03:00:22,309 --> 03:00:24,549
And then sleeping to five nights at Freddy's

3095
03:00:24,549 --> 03:00:27,250
with 10% of the vote.

3096
03:00:27,250 --> 03:00:28,250
That's kind of an upset.

3097
03:00:28,250 --> 03:00:31,659
I thought that scorn, all the scorners in the chat here,

3098
03:00:31,659 --> 03:00:35,459
probably gonna be pretty upset about that.

3099
03:00:35,459 --> 03:00:36,899
Well, we did the good one.

3100
03:00:38,639 --> 03:00:40,239
So why don't we do the bad one?

3101
03:00:41,899 --> 03:00:44,659
If you think that I nail it every time, you're wrong.

3102
03:00:46,840 --> 03:00:50,459
I have a tendency to, there's a couple of duds every year.

3103
03:00:50,459 --> 03:00:53,700
A couple of duds, not every joke is funny.

3104
03:00:53,700 --> 03:00:55,260
I don't expect them to be.

3105
03:00:55,260 --> 03:00:56,459
But how do you know if something's gonna be funny

3106
03:00:56,459 --> 03:00:58,760
if you don't do it?

3107
03:00:58,799 --> 03:01:01,040
Ladies and gentlemen, here are your nominees

3108
03:01:01,040 --> 03:01:04,000
for the worst joke of the year.

3109
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:05,520
Taking five minutes to set up.

3110
03:01:14,180 --> 03:01:15,020
What if I just like,

3111
03:01:15,020 --> 03:01:16,659
pretended to fall asleep on stream?

3112
03:01:16,659 --> 03:01:19,340
That's right, there it is.

3113
03:01:19,340 --> 03:01:21,100
All right, I'm gonna pretend to fall asleep on stream.

3114
03:01:21,100 --> 03:01:22,620
I'm gonna put a text on the bottom that says like,

3115
03:01:22,620 --> 03:01:24,379
dude, wicked fucking tired.

3116
03:01:24,379 --> 03:01:25,420
Like, had a long day.

3117
03:01:28,530 --> 03:01:30,530
And then you're woken up by the jump scare.

3118
03:01:30,530 --> 03:01:34,739
It might be a good one,

3119
03:01:34,739 --> 03:01:43,899
but it's probably great to get interestingly enough.

3120
03:01:43,899 --> 03:01:49,850
Fuck.

3121
03:01:49,850 --> 03:01:51,270
Yeah.

3122
03:01:52,149 --> 03:01:53,670
I don't know how I got in this Discord call,

3123
03:01:53,670 --> 03:01:54,790
but I need somebody to help.

3124
03:01:54,790 --> 03:01:57,510
I got the wrong server ID, I think.

3125
03:01:57,510 --> 03:01:59,030
I don't know how I got in this Discord call,

3126
03:01:59,030 --> 03:02:00,149
but I need somebody to help.

3127
03:02:00,149 --> 03:02:02,149
I got the wrong server ID, I think.

3128
03:02:03,709 --> 03:02:04,549
Did you click spectate?

3129
03:02:04,549 --> 03:02:05,389
It's on the bottom left.

3130
03:02:05,389 --> 03:02:06,829
No, I clicked a goddamn arrow.

3131
03:02:06,829 --> 03:02:07,670
Where is it?

3132
03:02:07,670 --> 03:02:09,750
I don't know how I got in this Discord call,

3133
03:02:09,750 --> 03:02:10,870
but I need somebody to help.

3134
03:02:10,870 --> 03:02:12,870
I got the wrong server ID, I think.

3135
03:02:12,870 --> 03:02:14,270
What the fuck is that?

3136
03:02:14,270 --> 03:02:15,670
I'm gonna have to go, I think.

3137
03:02:15,670 --> 03:02:17,750
Guys, I think I got in the wrong Discord call.

3138
03:02:17,750 --> 03:02:18,709
I don't know how I got in here.

3139
03:02:18,709 --> 03:02:19,790
I got the wrong server ID.

3140
03:02:19,790 --> 03:02:20,629
I don't know what's happening.

3141
03:02:20,629 --> 03:02:21,670
If somebody can troubleshoot with me,

3142
03:02:21,709 --> 03:02:23,389
I think I have to go up here.

3143
03:02:23,389 --> 03:02:24,229
Who is that guy?

3144
03:02:24,229 --> 03:02:25,069
Who is that guy?

3145
03:02:25,069 --> 03:02:25,909
What a weird guy.

3146
03:02:25,909 --> 03:02:26,750
This guy's weird.

3147
03:02:26,750 --> 03:02:27,590
A lunatic.

3148
03:02:27,590 --> 03:02:28,430
Was that somebody in the call?

3149
03:02:28,430 --> 03:02:29,270
Who was that?

3150
03:02:29,270 --> 03:02:31,829
Oh shit, I didn't know it was still on.

3151
03:02:31,829 --> 03:02:34,069
It's been on for hours now.

3152
03:02:35,110 --> 03:02:36,870
I forgot your old voice.

3153
03:02:36,870 --> 03:02:38,950
Can we ban Iron Giant?

3154
03:02:38,950 --> 03:02:40,459
No.

3155
03:02:40,459 --> 03:02:43,940
All right.

3156
03:02:43,940 --> 03:02:47,270
Well, all right, we just need to figure out

3157
03:02:47,270 --> 03:02:48,110
a solution to our problem.

3158
03:02:48,110 --> 03:02:50,430
I don't fucking care if we lost, I'm doing the joke.

3159
03:02:50,430 --> 03:02:51,750
Yeah.

3160
03:02:51,750 --> 03:02:54,069
What's up, Jack?

3161
03:02:54,069 --> 03:02:54,909
That was pretty good.

3162
03:02:54,909 --> 03:02:56,549
That was phenomenal, Jerma.

3163
03:02:57,430 --> 03:03:00,110
Oh, just one hit, one hit, one hit, one hit, one hit.

3164
03:03:00,110 --> 03:03:00,950
He's dead.

3165
03:03:00,950 --> 03:03:02,030
Okay, we're good, good, good, good, good.

3166
03:03:02,030 --> 03:03:02,870
Goddamn.

3167
03:03:02,870 --> 03:03:03,709
Woo.

3168
03:03:03,709 --> 03:03:04,549
Hey, what up?

3169
03:03:04,549 --> 03:03:05,389
How's it going?

3170
03:03:05,389 --> 03:03:06,229
What's up, Doc?

3171
03:03:06,229 --> 03:03:07,069
What's up, Doc?

3172
03:03:07,069 --> 03:03:08,670
I just bit my tongue in half.

3173
03:03:08,670 --> 03:03:09,790
We're in costume.

3174
03:03:09,790 --> 03:03:13,110
I'm Mercy from the Overwatch 2.

3175
03:03:13,110 --> 03:03:14,270
And who's that?

3176
03:03:14,270 --> 03:03:15,229
And hey, how are you?

3177
03:03:15,229 --> 03:03:16,190
It's me, Deadpool.

3178
03:03:16,190 --> 03:03:17,149
It's nice to see everybody.

3179
03:03:17,149 --> 03:03:18,909
Oh my God, it's so good to have you here.

3180
03:03:18,909 --> 03:03:20,350
Yeah, special guest here.

3181
03:03:20,350 --> 03:03:21,469
So where do we start?

3182
03:03:21,469 --> 03:03:22,309
I don't know, man.

3183
03:03:22,309 --> 03:03:23,149
I just showed up.

3184
03:03:23,149 --> 03:03:23,989
I just got the call.

3185
03:03:23,989 --> 03:03:24,829
Yeah.

3186
03:03:24,829 --> 03:03:25,670
They were like, hey man,

3187
03:03:26,229 --> 03:03:27,069
on Charlie's show.

3188
03:03:27,069 --> 03:03:28,110
I'm like, I love that guy.

3189
03:03:28,110 --> 03:03:30,729
Of course I'm going to be on that show.

3190
03:03:30,729 --> 03:03:32,530
I knocked out that motherfucker in the parking lot,

3191
03:03:32,530 --> 03:03:33,370
by the way.

3192
03:03:33,370 --> 03:03:34,209
He looked at me weird.

3193
03:03:34,209 --> 03:03:35,770
No, that sounds exactly what he deserved.

3194
03:03:35,770 --> 03:03:37,549
I'm like, I got to him.

3195
03:03:37,549 --> 03:03:38,670
Show him your high kick.

3196
03:03:38,670 --> 03:03:39,549
Yeah.

3197
03:03:39,549 --> 03:03:45,809
I went like this.

3198
03:03:45,809 --> 03:03:47,729
Hey kids.

3199
03:03:47,729 --> 03:03:52,819
Soda.

3200
03:03:52,819 --> 03:03:54,219
This sucked so bad.

3201
03:03:54,219 --> 03:03:55,219
Nobody move.

3202
03:03:55,219 --> 03:03:56,059
It's starting to lag.

3203
03:03:56,059 --> 03:03:57,860
It's starting to lag out.

3204
03:03:57,860 --> 03:04:00,420
I actually can't, I'm starting to get sick, I think.

3205
03:04:00,420 --> 03:04:02,059
I'm going to get sick.

3206
03:04:02,059 --> 03:04:03,780
I'm at like 20 frames a second.

3207
03:04:05,139 --> 03:04:07,979
Oh God, it's getting sick.

3208
03:04:07,979 --> 03:04:09,020
Here we go.

3209
03:04:12,040 --> 03:04:13,159
Soda said embarrassing.

3210
03:04:13,159 --> 03:04:14,079
Oh shit.

3211
03:04:14,079 --> 03:04:15,399
Oh shit, this is bad.

3212
03:04:15,399 --> 03:04:16,239
Actually be careful.

3213
03:04:16,239 --> 03:04:17,799
This might actually be flashing lights and stuff.

3214
03:04:17,799 --> 03:04:18,639
I'm not kidding.

3215
03:04:18,639 --> 03:04:26,629
Half these awards are embarrassing.

3216
03:04:26,629 --> 03:04:27,469
Okay, here you go.

3217
03:04:27,469 --> 03:04:30,020
You ready?

3218
03:04:30,020 --> 03:04:46,899
It's time for the latest episode of Breaking Bad.

3219
03:04:46,899 --> 03:04:48,299
This is fucking stupid.

3220
03:04:48,299 --> 03:04:50,260
That was so bad.

3221
03:04:50,260 --> 03:04:52,219
This is fucking dumb, man.

3222
03:04:52,219 --> 03:04:53,659
This is dumb.

3223
03:04:53,659 --> 03:04:56,420
If Jerma reads this, he has to do a pushup on stream.

3224
03:05:13,459 --> 03:05:24,790
Oh fuck.

3225
03:05:24,790 --> 03:05:33,059
Oh fuck.

3226
03:05:33,059 --> 03:05:38,280
I would have voted for Five Nights at Freddy's.

3227
03:05:38,280 --> 03:05:42,190
That's what I would have voted for.

3228
03:05:42,190 --> 03:05:44,629
But some of those I don't think deserve to be there.

3229
03:05:44,629 --> 03:05:46,520
I really don't.

3230
03:05:46,520 --> 03:05:48,280
Breaking Bad was just, I don't know.

3231
03:05:48,280 --> 03:05:50,079
I was just reaching at that point

3232
03:05:50,079 --> 03:05:52,360
because we were on the high of Scooby-Doo.

3233
03:05:52,360 --> 03:05:53,920
What's new, Scooby-Doo?

3234
03:05:53,920 --> 03:05:56,840
Coming after you, gonna find that.

3235
03:05:56,840 --> 03:05:58,360
And it's like, wow, this is so much fun.

3236
03:05:58,360 --> 03:05:59,200
I'm having so much fun.

3237
03:05:59,200 --> 03:06:00,440
Oh, what are the TV shows?

3238
03:06:00,440 --> 03:06:03,479
What are the television shows can we do, right?

3239
03:06:03,479 --> 03:06:05,000
Eh, I was reaching on the high.

3240
03:06:07,090 --> 03:06:08,969
Ladies and gentlemen, your winner

3241
03:06:08,969 --> 03:06:12,129
for worst joke of the entire year.

3242
03:06:12,129 --> 03:06:16,250
The worst joke of the year is

3243
03:06:16,250 --> 03:06:22,260
with 32% of the vote, someone got in the Discord.

3244
03:06:25,940 --> 03:06:27,860
Someone got in the Discord and it wasn't me.

3245
03:06:27,860 --> 03:06:30,180
Oh, someone's in the Discord.

3246
03:06:30,180 --> 03:06:33,100
Sleeping to Five Nights at Freddy's was 22%,

3247
03:06:33,100 --> 03:06:34,180
but hold on a minute.

3248
03:06:35,260 --> 03:06:38,260
So number two is Sleeping to Five Nights at Freddy's.

3249
03:06:38,260 --> 03:06:41,860
Number three on best of the year

3250
03:06:41,860 --> 03:06:44,829
was Sleeping to Five Nights at Freddy's.

3251
03:06:44,829 --> 03:06:48,370
So it was top three on here and top three on here.

3252
03:06:48,370 --> 03:06:51,139
You guys need to make up your mind.

3253
03:06:51,139 --> 03:06:57,100
And then doing pushups was 16.8%.

3254
03:06:57,100 --> 03:07:00,309
I would have voted for that one, probably.

3255
03:07:00,309 --> 03:07:02,670
The Breaking Bad one was pretty awful,

3256
03:07:02,670 --> 03:07:06,030
but you know, I'm not looking forward

3257
03:07:06,030 --> 03:07:12,979
to these next couple of categories.

3258
03:07:12,979 --> 03:07:15,379
These videos are probably 10 minutes long.

3259
03:07:15,420 --> 03:07:17,979
Something about the worst and best noise categories

3260
03:07:17,979 --> 03:07:22,709
this year, I mean, the mods went through it.

3261
03:07:22,709 --> 03:07:24,069
Me and Holly went through it.

3262
03:07:24,989 --> 03:07:27,479
We had to narrow this down.

3263
03:07:27,479 --> 03:07:30,860
Best and worst noise of the year,

3264
03:07:30,860 --> 03:07:34,579
there were 60 nominees until we really had

3265
03:07:34,579 --> 03:07:36,059
to get rid of some.

3266
03:07:36,059 --> 03:07:39,299
I think we brought it down to like 25 in each category.

3267
03:07:39,299 --> 03:07:42,819
So strap in, turn your volume down

3268
03:07:42,819 --> 03:07:45,020
because here are your nominees

3269
03:07:45,059 --> 03:07:51,979
for best noise of the year.

3270
03:07:51,979 --> 03:07:56,690
Or turn your volume up if that's what you care about.

3271
03:07:56,690 --> 03:07:57,729
Jesus.

3272
03:07:57,729 --> 03:08:00,170
Oh, what the fuck?

3273
03:08:00,170 --> 03:08:03,139
Score.

3274
03:08:03,139 --> 03:08:07,360
No!

3275
03:08:07,360 --> 03:08:11,649
One thing I can hold, I can hold the Wilma for.

3276
03:08:11,649 --> 03:08:27,940
Wilma!

3277
03:08:27,940 --> 03:08:29,219
Fucking long, dude.

3278
03:08:30,020 --> 03:08:32,020
I tried to walk over to my water in VR.

3279
03:08:32,020 --> 03:08:33,219
Hold on, no, that's not how that works.

3280
03:08:33,219 --> 03:08:34,379
Oh, I got a drink too.

3281
03:08:34,379 --> 03:08:39,219
That's pretty sus.

3282
03:08:39,219 --> 03:08:42,100
There was a cricket outside last night.

3283
03:08:42,100 --> 03:08:42,940
I swear to God.

3284
03:08:43,780 --> 03:08:44,620
I always wanted to record it,

3285
03:08:44,620 --> 03:08:46,020
like just get audio recorded

3286
03:08:46,020 --> 03:08:48,059
because this thing was so loud

3287
03:08:48,059 --> 03:08:51,139
and it was going super speed.

3288
03:08:51,139 --> 03:08:54,819
It wasn't, brr, brr, brr, brr.

3289
03:08:54,819 --> 03:08:57,979
This guy was looking for somebody.

3290
03:08:57,979 --> 03:09:04,170
It was like, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr.

3291
03:09:04,170 --> 03:09:05,010
Just like, what is it?

3292
03:09:05,010 --> 03:09:06,010
It was a hurt.

3293
03:09:06,010 --> 03:09:06,850
It was like static.

3294
03:09:06,850 --> 03:09:08,049
I couldn't stand it.

3295
03:09:08,049 --> 03:09:10,290
You know what sound that makes too.

3296
03:09:10,290 --> 03:09:11,129
It's like.

3297
03:09:14,690 --> 03:09:15,530
You just like that

3298
03:09:15,530 --> 03:09:17,129
because it sounds like the teacher noise.

3299
03:09:17,129 --> 03:09:17,969
Whee!

3300
03:09:19,989 --> 03:09:21,270
I can put it over my head.

3301
03:09:21,270 --> 03:09:25,069
Moving an amount of water from one room to another.

3302
03:09:25,069 --> 03:09:25,989
And go like this.

3303
03:09:30,819 --> 03:09:31,940
Should I do this?

3304
03:09:31,940 --> 03:09:32,940
Okay, I'll do it.

3305
03:09:38,020 --> 03:09:39,780
No, I just heard that in my head.

3306
03:09:39,780 --> 03:09:40,620
That hurt.

3307
03:09:47,959 --> 03:09:50,479
I heard somebody laugh off camera.

3308
03:09:50,479 --> 03:09:53,760
This is the Tasmanian devil in the electric chair.

3309
03:09:53,760 --> 03:09:54,600
Okay.

3310
03:09:55,159 --> 03:09:56,920
This doesn't sound right at all.

3311
03:09:56,920 --> 03:09:59,479
And let's do a scream test.

3312
03:09:59,479 --> 03:10:00,319
Wee!

3313
03:10:00,319 --> 03:10:01,159
Wee!

3314
03:10:01,159 --> 03:10:02,000
Wee!

3315
03:10:02,879 --> 03:10:04,000
Fixed it.

3316
03:10:04,000 --> 03:10:09,840
How can we look plastic today?

3317
03:10:09,840 --> 03:10:11,760
I mean, I don't feel plastic.

3318
03:10:20,200 --> 03:10:21,040
Two, two, one up.

3319
03:10:21,040 --> 03:10:22,879
That was pretty good.

3320
03:10:41,379 --> 03:10:42,379
Fuck.

3321
03:10:42,379 --> 03:10:43,219
Oh no.

3322
03:10:43,219 --> 03:10:44,059
It's one of those.

3323
03:10:44,100 --> 03:10:47,739
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

3324
03:10:47,739 --> 03:10:50,299
You're wearing red because you're the imposter.

3325
03:10:50,299 --> 03:10:51,139
Yes.

3326
03:11:00,739 --> 03:11:02,100
When I'm lying in my death bed

3327
03:11:02,100 --> 03:11:03,620
and I'm connected to like, you know what?

3328
03:11:03,620 --> 03:11:04,780
I'm like 90 or something.

3329
03:11:04,780 --> 03:11:06,620
Like a hundred.

3330
03:11:06,620 --> 03:11:08,139
And everyone's like gathered around the bed

3331
03:11:08,139 --> 03:11:09,620
and everyone's like, oh, let's just say goodbye

3332
03:11:09,620 --> 03:11:11,219
to grandpa, right?

3333
03:11:11,219 --> 03:11:13,219
You bet your ass that I'm gonna be like.

3334
03:11:21,159 --> 03:11:22,000
You bet your fucking ass

3335
03:11:22,000 --> 03:11:23,840
that's the last thing I'm leaving you with.

3336
03:11:25,780 --> 03:11:27,899
Give me, give me, give me, give me.

3337
03:11:50,100 --> 03:11:58,350
This is sucking me up.

3338
03:11:58,350 --> 03:12:02,860
How many people are here right now on the channel?

3339
03:12:02,860 --> 03:12:05,479
Do I have a number?

3340
03:12:05,479 --> 03:12:06,879
65.

3341
03:12:06,879 --> 03:12:09,790
There's 65,000 people here.

3342
03:12:09,790 --> 03:12:14,829
And you just got subjected to that.

3343
03:12:14,829 --> 03:12:19,579
So, should I apologize, or should we wait?

3344
03:12:20,520 --> 03:12:24,159
Should we wait for this one?

3345
03:12:24,159 --> 03:12:26,319
I'm gonna hold my apologies till this one.

3346
03:12:28,290 --> 03:12:31,930
Ladies and gentlemen, the, oh, I may have ripped it.

3347
03:12:31,930 --> 03:12:36,670
The winner for best noise of the entire year.

3348
03:12:37,569 --> 03:12:39,909
Was it ever gonna be close?

3349
03:12:39,909 --> 03:12:42,469
Let's spam it in the chat.

3350
03:12:42,469 --> 03:12:44,129
You know what it is, spam it.

3351
03:12:45,409 --> 03:12:47,270
I'll do it if you spam it.

3352
03:12:47,270 --> 03:12:48,670
I'll do it if you spam it.

3353
03:12:50,209 --> 03:12:59,399
Mm-hmm, scorn.

3354
03:12:59,399 --> 03:13:04,399
With 39% of the vote, scorn absolutely killed it.

3355
03:13:07,069 --> 03:13:09,989
Gimme, gimme, gimme was only 15.

3356
03:13:09,989 --> 03:13:12,409
Scorn absolutely dominated this category.

3357
03:13:13,309 --> 03:13:17,229
And then, are you the imposter was three.

3358
03:13:17,229 --> 03:13:19,629
So, scorn, a scorn sweep right there.

3359
03:13:19,629 --> 03:13:21,430
40% of the vote almost.

3360
03:13:21,430 --> 03:13:26,430
39.7% actually, which is, that's a lot.

3361
03:13:26,790 --> 03:13:29,989
So, to the almost 60, 70,000 people that are here right now,

3362
03:13:29,989 --> 03:13:33,069
I apologize for this next category.

3363
03:13:33,069 --> 03:13:34,729
I apologize in advance.

3364
03:13:34,729 --> 03:13:36,750
I said a lot of sorrys already,

3365
03:13:36,750 --> 03:13:38,870
but it's time for another one.

3366
03:13:38,870 --> 03:13:42,250
I'm sorry about this category.

3367
03:13:42,250 --> 03:13:45,110
Most nominees, I think, total.

3368
03:13:45,110 --> 03:13:47,510
That had to get dwindled down,

3369
03:13:47,510 --> 03:13:51,229
but we have a best noise, we have a worst noise.

3370
03:13:51,229 --> 03:13:54,510
They could just be the same category.

3371
03:13:54,510 --> 03:13:58,709
I should just do a thing where it's just noise of the year,

3372
03:13:58,709 --> 03:14:00,790
because why even have two categories?

3373
03:14:01,709 --> 03:14:05,690
Here are your nominees for worst noise of the year.

3374
03:14:27,170 --> 03:14:28,290
It's just, you know what I mean?

3375
03:14:28,290 --> 03:14:34,840
It's just the, it doesn't even lather up either.

3376
03:14:34,840 --> 03:14:44,319
I'm so, that was bad.

3377
03:14:44,319 --> 03:14:50,190
You've seen me do it, like a hundred times.

3378
03:14:50,190 --> 03:14:51,649
You can't dodge them all.

3379
03:14:52,489 --> 03:15:01,799
He's like, he's turning.

3380
03:15:01,799 --> 03:15:03,559
Oh shit, he's turning.

3381
03:15:03,559 --> 03:15:05,399
He just growled at him.

3382
03:15:05,399 --> 03:15:08,520
Wrong game, wrong game from software, wrong game.

3383
03:15:44,959 --> 03:15:46,159
Like some people eat a lobster,

3384
03:15:46,159 --> 03:15:47,319
like it's literally the last thing

3385
03:15:47,319 --> 03:15:49,719
they're ever gonna eat in their entire life.

3386
03:15:49,719 --> 03:15:50,559
And they like,

3387
03:15:53,610 --> 03:15:55,170
what's in here?

3388
03:15:55,170 --> 03:15:59,819
And it's just like, God damn it, what are you doing?

3389
03:15:59,819 --> 03:16:05,239
Oh, there's some still in there.

3390
03:16:05,239 --> 03:16:07,600
And I just, I don't like it, I don't like it.

3391
03:16:07,600 --> 03:16:08,799
I don't like it at all.

3392
03:16:08,799 --> 03:16:09,639
It's revolting.

3393
03:16:09,639 --> 03:16:10,479
It's absolutely fucking revolting.

3394
03:16:10,479 --> 03:16:12,120
How about you fucking relax?

3395
03:16:14,770 --> 03:16:18,010
Young Madduck, apprentice to Hunwit, the dream chanter,

3396
03:16:18,010 --> 03:16:20,170
removes his instrument from its case.

3397
03:16:20,170 --> 03:16:23,250
His features, composed, take on a startling dignity.

3398
03:16:26,280 --> 03:16:28,600
Let's hear it.

3399
03:16:35,139 --> 03:16:35,979
Oh!

3400
03:16:43,739 --> 03:16:47,420
What, this is on here twice?

3401
03:16:47,420 --> 03:16:49,260
How many times was this nominated?

3402
03:16:55,719 --> 03:16:58,280
Can I just say this is the worst moment of the whole year?

3403
03:16:58,280 --> 03:16:59,120
I can say that, right?

3404
03:16:59,120 --> 03:17:01,979
It's my channel.

3405
03:17:01,979 --> 03:17:06,620
Wait, it's from the ghost.

3406
03:17:06,620 --> 03:17:07,459
That's it?

3407
03:17:07,459 --> 03:17:14,819
It goes like, I just threw one of those nerf,

3408
03:17:14,819 --> 03:17:17,180
you know those nerfs, whistlers?

3409
03:17:17,180 --> 03:17:18,020
The thing that like,

3410
03:17:18,020 --> 03:17:19,979
Brett Favre was in the commercial and he threw it like,

3411
03:17:20,459 --> 03:17:21,620
I can throw this a hundred yards.

3412
03:17:21,620 --> 03:17:22,459
And it goes.

3413
03:17:24,540 --> 03:17:25,819
I just threw one of those.

3414
03:17:29,389 --> 03:17:33,600
I know what this is for.

3415
03:17:33,600 --> 03:17:35,000
We're all the way over here.

3416
03:17:38,120 --> 03:17:38,959
So.

3417
03:17:38,959 --> 03:17:39,799
What's wrong with you?

3418
03:17:39,799 --> 03:17:40,639
What's wrong with you?

3419
03:17:40,639 --> 03:17:45,040
My baby, my baby, I only chose.

3420
03:17:45,040 --> 03:17:46,879
Hold on.

3421
03:17:46,879 --> 03:17:48,299
No.

3422
03:17:48,299 --> 03:17:49,139
Oh.

3423
03:17:50,139 --> 03:17:51,459
I'm sorry, I'm really in production.

3424
03:17:51,459 --> 03:17:53,100
Probably fucking just cringed.

3425
03:17:58,739 --> 03:17:59,579
Did you guys hear that?

3426
03:17:59,579 --> 03:18:07,399
What the fuck was that?

3427
03:18:07,399 --> 03:18:10,879
There is recency bias, I think, on this one.

3428
03:18:10,879 --> 03:18:13,950
We have some recency bias, I think.

3429
03:18:13,950 --> 03:18:14,790
I don't think,

3430
03:18:14,790 --> 03:18:17,389
I can literally see it through the paper, by the way.

3431
03:18:19,799 --> 03:18:20,639
I peeked.

3432
03:18:23,420 --> 03:18:24,260
Ladies and gentlemen,

3433
03:18:24,260 --> 03:18:25,860
the worst noise of the entire year,

3434
03:18:25,860 --> 03:18:29,920
recency bias, come on.

3435
03:18:29,920 --> 03:18:34,459
The multi versus squeal at 20% of the vote,

3436
03:18:34,459 --> 03:18:36,809
not that bad.

3437
03:18:36,809 --> 03:18:40,549
Growls at chat with 18.8.

3438
03:18:40,629 --> 03:18:43,190
And I don't even, I don't know what this one is.

3439
03:18:44,190 --> 03:18:47,030
Suck, snort, wheeze, cackle.

3440
03:18:47,909 --> 03:18:50,360
Do we even know, what is that one?

3441
03:18:50,360 --> 03:18:52,600
Suck, snort, wheeze, cackle.

3442
03:18:52,600 --> 03:18:54,840
I was trying to watch, but I couldn't even,

3443
03:18:54,840 --> 03:18:56,280
I don't know what that one is.

3444
03:18:57,559 --> 03:18:58,399
Very good to know.

3445
03:19:00,309 --> 03:19:03,250
A third most skipped category.

3446
03:19:03,250 --> 03:19:08,250
13% of you that took the test did not take this one.

3447
03:19:08,329 --> 03:19:09,770
You're like, fuck it, I don't wanna hear that.

3448
03:19:09,770 --> 03:19:11,430
I don't care.

3449
03:19:11,430 --> 03:19:14,110
Which makes sense considering there's so many categories.

3450
03:19:14,110 --> 03:19:17,430
And okay, but multi versus squeal.

3451
03:19:17,430 --> 03:19:19,069
Hey, multi versus is a great game.

3452
03:19:19,069 --> 03:19:20,469
You should try it.

3453
03:19:20,469 --> 03:19:21,309
You know what?

3454
03:19:21,309 --> 03:19:23,760
Can we check in with the puzzle room?

3455
03:19:23,760 --> 03:19:24,760
Let's take a look at the puzzle room.

3456
03:19:24,760 --> 03:19:26,920
How's the puzzle, the puzzler's doing?

3457
03:19:29,180 --> 03:19:34,180
No one's doing anything.

3458
03:19:36,899 --> 03:19:39,860
Have they not done any of the puzzle?

3459
03:19:41,250 --> 03:19:44,159
Zero, hold on.

3460
03:19:44,200 --> 03:19:46,600
There's only one person doing it.

3461
03:19:46,600 --> 03:19:47,600
I'm going in there.

3462
03:19:49,000 --> 03:19:52,760
There's only one, they're all just like eating sandwiches.

3463
03:19:52,760 --> 03:19:54,079
I need to see the progress.

3464
03:19:54,079 --> 03:19:55,920
Oh, God.

3465
03:20:05,889 --> 03:20:14,040
I'm not gonna be angry.

3466
03:20:14,040 --> 03:20:14,879
Hi everybody.

3467
03:20:19,930 --> 03:20:23,129
It seems as if there is,

3468
03:20:23,129 --> 03:20:26,530
it looks like you've blocked out some areas.

3469
03:20:28,290 --> 03:20:29,530
Can you get this?

3470
03:20:31,090 --> 03:20:32,250
Where's the camera?

3471
03:20:32,290 --> 03:20:34,489
Can you see this over here?

3472
03:20:35,409 --> 03:20:39,969
They have one edge of one of the corners.

3473
03:20:41,569 --> 03:20:43,770
What have you been doing in here?

3474
03:20:43,770 --> 03:20:44,610
What's going on?

3475
03:20:44,610 --> 03:20:45,430
What are you doing here?

3476
03:20:45,430 --> 03:20:46,270
What is this?

3477
03:20:46,270 --> 03:20:47,489
You playing cards?

3478
03:20:47,489 --> 03:20:53,260
Yeah.

3479
03:20:53,260 --> 03:20:56,790
Excuse me.

3480
03:20:56,790 --> 03:21:01,200
What?

3481
03:21:01,200 --> 03:21:04,950
Santa said to be nicer.

3482
03:21:04,950 --> 03:21:16,510
So if you could please finish one section.

3483
03:21:17,430 --> 03:21:19,590
This was a lot of money.

3484
03:21:19,590 --> 03:21:20,909
This cost a lot of money.

3485
03:21:20,909 --> 03:21:22,590
You heard Ludwig and you heard H. Rucker.

3486
03:21:22,590 --> 03:21:24,870
By the way, where the fuck are they?

3487
03:21:24,870 --> 03:21:26,469
Sorry if it's worth.

3488
03:21:26,469 --> 03:21:29,479
You know what?

3489
03:21:29,479 --> 03:21:33,440
They're drinking and they're drinking too.

3490
03:21:33,440 --> 03:21:34,399
You know what?

3491
03:21:34,399 --> 03:21:35,680
Deal me.

3492
03:21:35,680 --> 03:21:38,000
You want to go?

3493
03:21:38,000 --> 03:21:40,000
Blackjack, you and me.

3494
03:21:40,000 --> 03:21:40,840
Who wants to go?

3495
03:21:40,840 --> 03:21:42,159
You and me?

3496
03:21:42,159 --> 03:21:43,239
Blackjack.

3497
03:21:43,239 --> 03:21:45,090
I'll be the dealer.

3498
03:21:45,090 --> 03:21:46,329
Where are the cards?

3499
03:21:46,329 --> 03:21:47,569
Let's go Blackjack.

3500
03:21:48,090 --> 03:21:50,489
What are these comically huge cards?

3501
03:21:52,299 --> 03:21:55,180
Hey, by the way, is this the Ace of Clubs?

3502
03:21:55,180 --> 03:21:56,020
Nope.

3503
03:21:56,020 --> 03:21:58,340
That would have been fucking insane if it was.

3504
03:21:58,340 --> 03:21:59,180
You want to go Blackjack?

3505
03:21:59,180 --> 03:22:00,420
Ready?

3506
03:22:00,420 --> 03:22:01,659
You want to play Blackjack?

3507
03:22:04,360 --> 03:22:05,559
Why did you write this?

3508
03:22:07,440 --> 03:22:08,959
You wanted to see that movie?

3509
03:22:09,920 --> 03:22:10,760
In here.

3510
03:22:13,870 --> 03:22:16,670
You just wanted to see Avatar 2 The Way of Water.

3511
03:22:16,709 --> 03:22:19,950
We don't pay us enough to go watch it ourselves.

3512
03:22:19,950 --> 03:22:21,149
What does this one say?

3513
03:22:22,510 --> 03:22:26,030
Send hot cups of, that's a funny joke.

3514
03:22:26,030 --> 03:22:27,229
What does this one say?

3515
03:22:28,350 --> 03:22:29,590
My name is Danny Elfman.

3516
03:22:29,590 --> 03:22:30,670
Please hurry.

3517
03:22:32,270 --> 03:22:33,670
I actually don't get it.

3518
03:22:33,670 --> 03:22:35,709
Do it for Puzzle Girl.

3519
03:22:35,709 --> 03:22:36,829
Who's Puzzle Girl?

3520
03:22:37,829 --> 03:22:39,600
You.

3521
03:22:39,600 --> 03:22:41,559
What are we doing exactly?

3522
03:22:42,600 --> 03:22:43,440
Do it.

3523
03:22:45,000 --> 03:22:45,920
Okay.

3524
03:22:45,920 --> 03:22:46,760
You ready?

3525
03:22:48,120 --> 03:22:50,969
Everybody here is being, by the way,

3526
03:22:50,969 --> 03:22:52,770
everybody here is being paid.

3527
03:22:52,770 --> 03:22:55,049
Just want to make sure everyone understands that.

3528
03:22:55,049 --> 03:22:55,889
How much you bet?

3529
03:22:56,889 --> 03:22:59,290
Yeah, I don't want the bank to take care of you.

3530
03:22:59,290 --> 03:23:00,850
It's like 600 bucks.

3531
03:23:10,780 --> 03:23:12,899
Right there is eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13.

3532
03:23:12,899 --> 03:23:14,459
That's 14.

3533
03:23:14,459 --> 03:23:15,299
What are you going to do?

3534
03:23:15,299 --> 03:23:18,100
Versus a, by the way, can you see this?

3535
03:23:18,100 --> 03:23:19,139
I got a 10 showing here.

3536
03:23:19,139 --> 03:23:20,940
What are you going to do?

3537
03:23:20,940 --> 03:23:22,700
You're going to hit.

3538
03:23:22,700 --> 03:23:24,899
That is eight, five, 10.

3539
03:23:24,899 --> 03:23:25,940
That's 18.

3540
03:23:25,940 --> 03:23:27,059
You're going to stay?

3541
03:23:27,059 --> 03:23:27,899
Staying.

3542
03:23:27,899 --> 03:23:29,639
Okay.

3543
03:23:29,639 --> 03:23:34,959
Don't look.

3544
03:23:34,959 --> 03:23:35,799
17.

3545
03:23:47,690 --> 03:23:48,530
Stop!

3546
03:23:50,420 --> 03:23:51,659
Give me that.

3547
03:23:51,659 --> 03:23:52,579
Give me that toy.

3548
03:23:52,579 --> 03:23:53,659
Don't give it to him.

3549
03:23:53,659 --> 03:23:55,540
Give me, Santa, if you're watching,

3550
03:23:55,540 --> 03:23:57,139
I'm just being funny.

3551
03:23:57,139 --> 03:23:57,979
Give me that toy.

3552
03:24:02,979 --> 03:24:05,299
I've made sure to not.

3553
03:24:05,299 --> 03:24:09,780
Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.

3554
03:24:10,819 --> 03:24:15,540
35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60.

3555
03:24:15,540 --> 03:24:16,739
You just made $60.

3556
03:24:18,379 --> 03:24:31,750
Woo!

3557
03:24:31,750 --> 03:24:32,829
Gonna do another category.

3558
03:24:32,829 --> 03:24:33,670
Excuse me.

3559
03:24:33,670 --> 03:24:34,989
Merry Christmas!

3560
03:24:34,989 --> 03:24:40,780
Merry Christmas!

3561
03:24:40,780 --> 03:24:41,620
What do you mean you can't do?

3562
03:24:41,620 --> 03:24:44,100
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3563
03:24:44,100 --> 03:24:45,899
Can't do math?

3564
03:24:45,899 --> 03:24:46,739
What happened?

3565
03:24:47,819 --> 03:24:48,940
I can't do math.

3566
03:24:48,940 --> 03:24:51,040
What happened?

3567
03:24:51,040 --> 03:24:51,879
Did I get it?

3568
03:24:51,879 --> 03:24:52,719
Wait.

3569
03:24:52,719 --> 03:24:53,559
Count those cards.

3570
03:24:53,559 --> 03:24:56,799
Wait, hold on a second.

3571
03:24:56,799 --> 03:24:58,000
This is 17.

3572
03:24:58,000 --> 03:24:58,840
That's 10.

3573
03:24:58,840 --> 03:24:59,680
18.

3574
03:24:59,680 --> 03:25:02,069
What are you talking about?

3575
03:25:02,069 --> 03:25:03,469
She won.

3576
03:25:03,469 --> 03:25:04,350
What do you mean you can't count?

3577
03:25:04,350 --> 03:25:05,750
That's literally 18 versus seven.

3578
03:25:05,750 --> 03:25:07,590
What are you talking about?

3579
03:25:08,430 --> 03:25:10,829
I'm a man of my word, so guess what?

3580
03:25:10,829 --> 03:25:15,829
All the elves in this area, you're going to split $60.

3581
03:25:17,989 --> 03:25:25,280
Woo!

3582
03:25:25,280 --> 03:25:28,360
Elves, elves, elves, elves, elves, elves, elves, elves, elves.

3583
03:25:28,360 --> 03:25:29,440
13 elves.

3584
03:25:29,440 --> 03:25:32,479
Ladies and gentlemen, 13 elves divided,

3585
03:25:32,479 --> 03:25:34,520
60 divided by 13 is?

3586
03:25:34,520 --> 03:25:36,079
$100.

3587
03:25:36,079 --> 03:25:39,079
Yeah!

3588
03:25:39,079 --> 03:25:40,239
Each.

3589
03:25:40,239 --> 03:25:42,209
It's like two bucks each.

3590
03:25:42,209 --> 03:25:43,370
Hey, how about this?

3591
03:25:44,409 --> 03:25:45,969
We'll double your pay.

3592
03:25:52,709 --> 03:25:56,799
How much they were getting paid in the end is good.

3593
03:25:56,799 --> 03:25:57,760
Whatever.

3594
03:25:57,760 --> 03:26:00,760
I mean, they were paid to do a puzzle

3595
03:26:00,760 --> 03:26:02,719
and they didn't do it.

3596
03:26:02,719 --> 03:26:03,559
Let me make sure.

3597
03:26:03,559 --> 03:26:05,200
Let me be very clear.

3598
03:26:05,200 --> 03:26:06,040
They were paid.

3599
03:26:06,040 --> 03:26:10,149
They were all, those people were paid to be here.

3600
03:26:10,149 --> 03:26:14,200
They were all paid to be here to do a puzzle.

3601
03:26:14,200 --> 03:26:17,459
How much income is that worth?

3602
03:26:17,459 --> 03:26:18,500
I'll double their pay.

3603
03:26:18,500 --> 03:26:19,420
Fine.

3604
03:26:19,420 --> 03:26:22,680
Yeah.

3605
03:26:22,680 --> 03:26:23,520
How about this?

3606
03:26:23,520 --> 03:26:25,450
Hey elves, can you hear me?

3607
03:26:25,450 --> 03:26:28,920
Elves, you can hear me, right?

3608
03:26:28,920 --> 03:26:30,639
How about this?

3609
03:26:30,639 --> 03:26:33,680
You get one section done.

3610
03:26:33,680 --> 03:26:36,200
And I mean, even a border.

3611
03:26:37,520 --> 03:26:40,559
And I'll quadruple your pay.

3612
03:26:40,559 --> 03:26:44,850
I wonder if they'll do it.

3613
03:26:44,850 --> 03:26:47,829
I will five times your pay.

3614
03:26:47,829 --> 03:26:49,510
Get a border done.

3615
03:26:52,250 --> 03:26:54,090
100 each?

3616
03:26:54,090 --> 03:26:56,209
Look, now they're all standing.

3617
03:26:56,209 --> 03:26:57,530
Now they're all ready to go.

3618
03:26:57,530 --> 03:26:59,290
They're like, holy shit, let's go.

3619
03:27:04,639 --> 03:27:06,360
They were all sitting before.

3620
03:27:07,739 --> 03:27:10,700
Now, hey, can we give it up for the elves?

3621
03:27:11,540 --> 03:27:13,510
In the chat, give it up for the elves.

3622
03:27:13,510 --> 03:27:15,750
You know, hey, hey, hey, you know what?

3623
03:27:15,750 --> 03:27:20,399
Hey, hey, let's five times their pay for fucking no reason.

3624
03:27:20,399 --> 03:27:22,239
How does that sound?

3625
03:27:22,239 --> 03:27:23,079
I'll do it.

3626
03:27:23,079 --> 03:27:27,219
Easy.

3627
03:27:27,219 --> 03:27:28,719
Do the puzzle.

3628
03:27:28,719 --> 03:27:30,159
That's what you're here for.

3629
03:27:30,159 --> 03:27:32,440
And I may have almost hit somebody in the face

3630
03:27:32,440 --> 03:27:34,600
with that turkey that I threw.

3631
03:27:35,600 --> 03:27:38,079
All right, we're at the next category.

3632
03:27:38,079 --> 03:27:42,239
This is best one guy moment.

3633
03:27:42,239 --> 03:27:45,200
One guy, there's a lot of people here.

3634
03:27:45,719 --> 03:27:47,639
I imagine some of you don't know what the hell this means.

3635
03:27:47,639 --> 03:27:52,639
A one guy is when somebody kind of derails the stream.

3636
03:27:54,719 --> 03:27:57,879
I will see it, I will comment on it,

3637
03:27:57,879 --> 03:28:01,440
and it changes the outcome of the rest of the day.

3638
03:28:01,440 --> 03:28:03,239
It's not just, oh, yeah, yeah, I read a comment.

3639
03:28:03,239 --> 03:28:04,239
No, no, no, no.

3640
03:28:04,239 --> 03:28:06,719
A one guy moment is you've changed

3641
03:28:06,719 --> 03:28:09,079
the course of history completely.

3642
03:28:12,069 --> 03:28:24,799
Here are your nominees for best one guy moment of the year.

3643
03:28:25,200 --> 03:28:26,719
I'm not gonna encourage this behavior,

3644
03:28:26,719 --> 03:28:28,600
but I'm gonna tell you something right now.

3645
03:28:28,600 --> 03:28:30,719
Don't fucking, this is not to be encouraged,

3646
03:28:30,719 --> 03:28:32,840
but it was just like, what the fuck, man?

3647
03:28:33,959 --> 03:28:36,559
Somebody asked what the baseball stream is.

3648
03:28:36,559 --> 03:28:37,479
And I said, whatever.

3649
03:28:37,479 --> 03:28:39,319
And then like, it's been like five minutes.

3650
03:28:39,319 --> 03:28:40,840
It's been like at least five minutes.

3651
03:28:40,840 --> 03:28:42,760
Somebody like added that person, I think,

3652
03:28:42,760 --> 03:28:45,040
and said he's gonna shove an entire baseball

3653
03:28:45,040 --> 03:28:47,000
up his ass on the stream.

3654
03:28:47,000 --> 03:28:50,079
This person's name too, yeah, what the fuck?

3655
03:28:50,079 --> 03:28:54,159
Their name was Ball Fondler, okay?

3656
03:28:54,239 --> 03:28:55,079
Okay.

3657
03:28:55,079 --> 03:28:56,799
Remember, you're on the website.

3658
03:28:56,799 --> 03:28:58,159
For collecting all of them.

3659
03:28:58,159 --> 03:28:59,000
What?

3660
03:28:59,000 --> 03:29:00,399
I don't want to stifle the intrinsic-

3661
03:29:00,399 --> 03:29:02,079
You're on the QR code?

3662
03:29:02,079 --> 03:29:02,920
What?

3663
03:29:02,920 --> 03:29:09,079
It's taking this friend of thumbnails.

3664
03:29:09,079 --> 03:29:11,040
Is it there?

3665
03:29:11,040 --> 03:29:12,889
All right.

3666
03:29:12,889 --> 03:29:15,680
What?

3667
03:29:15,680 --> 03:29:18,219
All right, now put the tarantula in my mouth.

3668
03:29:18,219 --> 03:29:19,899
Put the tarantula in my mouth.

3669
03:29:19,899 --> 03:29:21,700
I'm gonna be like shocked that it's in there.

3670
03:29:21,700 --> 03:29:22,540
You know what I mean?

3671
03:29:22,540 --> 03:29:25,860
Like.

3672
03:29:25,860 --> 03:29:28,440
I keep pulling.

3673
03:29:31,200 --> 03:29:34,120
The dev, the dev is even sick of this joke.

3674
03:29:34,959 --> 03:29:35,799
The dev is like, all right, it's kind of funny,

3675
03:29:35,799 --> 03:29:37,639
but like fucking hurry up.

3676
03:29:37,639 --> 03:29:39,719
I mean, we have to summon the person

3677
03:29:39,719 --> 03:29:42,399
that's called Barf Drinker, okay?

3678
03:29:42,399 --> 03:29:43,239
And then that's it.

3679
03:29:43,239 --> 03:29:45,200
Oh my God, I'm gonna get BM'd, aren't I?

3680
03:29:48,620 --> 03:29:54,799
It's so stupid.

3681
03:29:54,799 --> 03:29:56,639
He's throwing rocks at me.

3682
03:29:56,639 --> 03:29:57,479
All right.

3683
03:29:57,479 --> 03:29:59,520
No, no, no, no, no, no.

3684
03:30:00,559 --> 03:30:02,040
No, no, no.

3685
03:30:02,040 --> 03:30:08,879
I'm not gonna let this happen.

3686
03:30:08,879 --> 03:30:09,879
Oh my God, I'm dead.

3687
03:30:09,879 --> 03:30:11,239
I can't believe this.

3688
03:30:11,239 --> 03:30:12,639
We're watching you in a bar, Jerma.

3689
03:30:12,639 --> 03:30:14,579
Do something wacky.

3690
03:30:14,579 --> 03:30:17,850
Hey.

3691
03:30:17,889 --> 03:30:22,420
Hey, this one goes out to all y'all in the bar.

3692
03:30:22,420 --> 03:30:30,090
Hey, three, two, one, let's go.

3693
03:30:30,090 --> 03:30:32,819
Mm, green tea.

3694
03:30:32,819 --> 03:30:35,139
They can't even hear me.

3695
03:30:35,139 --> 03:30:36,379
Should I try to communicate?

3696
03:30:36,379 --> 03:30:40,809
Hey, you, wait, look.

3697
03:30:40,809 --> 03:30:45,409
Hey, everybody, hey.

3698
03:30:45,409 --> 03:30:52,959
One, two, three.

3699
03:30:52,959 --> 03:30:54,590
Yeah.

3700
03:30:54,590 --> 03:30:55,829
Oh, I wanna show this too.

3701
03:30:55,829 --> 03:30:57,260
Hold on.

3702
03:30:57,260 --> 03:30:59,860
Somebody actually made this.

3703
03:30:59,860 --> 03:31:04,379
These are really romantic candles.

3704
03:31:04,420 --> 03:31:09,670
No, it probably stinks up here.

3705
03:31:09,670 --> 03:31:12,309
I, gosh, I filled the room with red candles

3706
03:31:12,309 --> 03:31:15,579
like you wanted.

3707
03:31:15,579 --> 03:31:19,670
Gary, you fucking idiot.

3708
03:31:19,670 --> 03:31:23,069
Did you have to get the red cinnamon apple candle

3709
03:31:23,069 --> 03:31:25,270
from Yankee Candle and put it in every room?

3710
03:31:27,579 --> 03:31:30,809
Somebody said just eat a handful.

3711
03:31:30,809 --> 03:31:32,209
That'd be so fucked up.

3712
03:31:32,209 --> 03:31:33,209
You'd probably have like,

3713
03:31:33,209 --> 03:31:36,450
you'd probably have like a fucking like mental breakdown.

3714
03:31:37,569 --> 03:31:38,930
It's not designed for that.

3715
03:31:38,930 --> 03:31:40,170
Eat a handful.

3716
03:31:40,489 --> 03:31:44,049
It'd be fucking disgusting.

3717
03:31:44,049 --> 03:31:45,959
I'm kind of curious.

3718
03:31:45,959 --> 03:31:59,059
I'm curious, let's go.

3719
03:31:59,059 --> 03:32:00,899
It tastes like hamburger meat.

3720
03:32:00,899 --> 03:32:02,340
It tastes like hamburger meat.

3721
03:32:03,500 --> 03:32:05,420
Do you want Mario drug PSA?

3722
03:32:12,709 --> 03:32:15,110
Hoo, b-ah-hoo, b-ah-hoo.

3723
03:32:15,110 --> 03:32:18,579
Whoa.

3724
03:32:18,579 --> 03:32:20,430
Hi, ladies and gentlemen.

3725
03:32:20,430 --> 03:32:22,819
I'm Super Mario.

3726
03:32:22,819 --> 03:32:23,940
We've made a lot of jokes here today.

3727
03:32:23,940 --> 03:32:25,459
We've had a lot of fun.

3728
03:32:25,459 --> 03:32:27,760
And I'm an actor.

3729
03:32:27,760 --> 03:32:29,040
But let me just be the first to tell you that,

3730
03:32:29,040 --> 03:32:30,360
you know, it's not fun.

3731
03:32:30,479 --> 03:32:36,059
What is not totally b-ah-hoo, drugs and alcohol.

3732
03:32:36,059 --> 03:32:37,299
This is by somebody in the community.

3733
03:32:37,299 --> 03:32:39,379
Are they comfortable with me sharing their name?

3734
03:32:39,379 --> 03:32:42,219
I don't want to share their name if they're not comfortable.

3735
03:32:42,219 --> 03:32:45,219
Ah, but anyways, they discovered a new way

3736
03:32:45,219 --> 03:32:47,420
of isolating viruses that kill

3737
03:32:47,420 --> 03:32:50,270
antibiotic resistant bacteria.

3738
03:32:50,270 --> 03:32:53,819
Somebody in this community.

3739
03:32:53,819 --> 03:32:56,020
And the first one I discovered using this method,

3740
03:32:56,020 --> 03:32:58,659
I named after germa.

3741
03:32:58,659 --> 03:33:01,100
This is apparently it fucking working.

3742
03:33:01,420 --> 03:33:06,139
Against bacteria, antibiotic bacteria resistant shit.

3743
03:33:06,139 --> 03:33:07,860
That's me in there.

3744
03:33:07,860 --> 03:33:10,780
That's me taking care of that.

3745
03:33:10,780 --> 03:33:12,180
I'm in there and I'm getting all of those

3746
03:33:12,180 --> 03:33:14,379
fucking molecules and I'm destroying them.

3747
03:33:14,379 --> 03:33:15,659
Make a sandwich with wood.

3748
03:33:15,659 --> 03:33:26,079
Make a wood sandwich.

3749
03:33:28,780 --> 03:33:31,139
I can't, I can't.

3750
03:33:31,139 --> 03:33:38,370
Submit this.

3751
03:33:38,370 --> 03:33:39,569
Play for now.

3752
03:33:39,569 --> 03:33:43,760
Okay.

3753
03:33:43,760 --> 03:33:44,959
Fucking quit the goddamn game.

3754
03:33:44,959 --> 03:33:50,030
I exited the fucking game.

3755
03:33:50,030 --> 03:33:53,840
What the fuck is happening?

3756
03:33:53,840 --> 03:34:08,299
If Jerma reads this, he has to do a pushup on stream.

3757
03:34:08,299 --> 03:34:12,250
One, two, three, seven.

3758
03:34:23,860 --> 03:34:24,940
Oh, fuck.

3759
03:34:24,940 --> 03:34:26,219
Oh, fuck.

3760
03:34:26,219 --> 03:34:30,340
The ring light around your neck.

3761
03:34:30,340 --> 03:34:34,139
If I put the ring light around my neck,

3762
03:34:34,139 --> 03:34:35,420
it could actually fit.

3763
03:34:36,940 --> 03:34:38,459
That would be fucking stupid.

3764
03:34:38,459 --> 03:34:42,420
Wait a minute.

3765
03:34:50,959 --> 03:34:52,360
Nice swag, thanks.

3766
03:34:53,319 --> 03:34:57,950
I was told that if I spin a hundred times at $10,

3767
03:34:57,950 --> 03:35:00,920
starting with a thousand dollars on this slot machine,

3768
03:35:00,920 --> 03:35:03,840
that I will be able to get to 10,000 plus dollars.

3769
03:35:03,840 --> 03:35:05,280
There's a person in chat here who is putting

3770
03:35:05,280 --> 03:35:10,149
their stream chat life here.

3771
03:35:10,149 --> 03:35:11,430
They're going to be banned from the channel

3772
03:35:11,430 --> 03:35:13,950
if it doesn't work or they're gonna get VIP'd if it does.

3773
03:35:13,950 --> 03:35:19,729
Three, four, five.

3774
03:35:19,729 --> 03:35:23,079
Oh my God.

3775
03:35:23,079 --> 03:35:25,319
I'm so sorry.

3776
03:35:25,319 --> 03:35:27,459
Hello.

3777
03:35:27,500 --> 03:35:28,659
Yeah, and guess what?

3778
03:35:28,659 --> 03:35:30,020
You can hear me, huh?

3779
03:35:30,020 --> 03:35:31,739
You can hear me pretty well.

3780
03:35:31,739 --> 03:35:35,729
Not like it was before.

3781
03:35:35,729 --> 03:35:37,409
What the fuck, dude?

3782
03:35:37,409 --> 03:35:39,670
I'm not gonna drink a, hold on.

3783
03:35:39,670 --> 03:35:42,000
All right, hold on.

3784
03:35:42,000 --> 03:35:42,840
Let's tweet that.

3785
03:35:42,840 --> 03:35:43,920
How long is this fucking?

3786
03:35:43,920 --> 03:35:46,319
Yeah, so hopefully it sounds all right.

3787
03:35:46,319 --> 03:35:48,040
These things are pretty cool.

3788
03:35:48,040 --> 03:35:49,600
These things, let me try a scream test.

3789
03:35:49,600 --> 03:35:51,879
Can I try, can I try, hold on.

3790
03:35:51,879 --> 03:35:52,719
Can I scream?

3791
03:35:52,719 --> 03:35:53,559
Can I scream in your ears?

3792
03:35:53,559 --> 03:35:55,680
I'm gonna scream in your ears.

3793
03:35:55,680 --> 03:35:59,110
They should fucking remove geometry from school.

3794
03:35:59,110 --> 03:36:00,549
Teach people how to do their taxes.

3795
03:36:00,549 --> 03:36:04,700
I got some soft locked?

3796
03:36:04,700 --> 03:36:05,540
How?

3797
03:36:05,540 --> 03:36:06,379
No, I'm not.

3798
03:36:06,379 --> 03:36:08,979
Someone tell Jerma I can tell them how to fix their save.

3799
03:36:08,979 --> 03:36:09,819
How do I do it?

3800
03:36:09,819 --> 03:36:10,739
How do I do it?

3801
03:36:10,739 --> 03:36:12,059
How do I do it?

3802
03:36:12,059 --> 03:36:13,260
That's so funny.

3803
03:36:13,260 --> 03:36:14,340
How do I fix my save?

3804
03:36:14,340 --> 03:36:17,299
Try X560Y330.

3805
03:36:17,299 --> 03:36:18,139
New tweet.

3806
03:36:18,139 --> 03:36:18,979
No, wait.

3807
03:36:18,979 --> 03:36:21,200
Z330.

3808
03:36:21,200 --> 03:36:24,459
Oh, Dev, looks like you're having a little bit of trouble

3809
03:36:24,459 --> 03:36:27,219
with geometry, aren't you?

3810
03:36:27,219 --> 03:36:28,899
Looks like the Dev is having a little bit of trouble

3811
03:36:28,899 --> 03:36:29,739
with geometry.

3812
03:36:30,979 --> 03:36:34,219
Dev, when was the last time you were in fucking high school?

3813
03:36:34,219 --> 03:36:35,379
When was I?

3814
03:36:35,379 --> 03:36:37,540
I am gonna get so validated right now.

3815
03:36:37,540 --> 03:36:41,069
I suck at math.

3816
03:36:41,069 --> 03:36:41,950
I suck at math.

3817
03:36:41,950 --> 03:36:42,950
I am in my 30s.

3818
03:36:42,950 --> 03:36:44,909
I haven't had to do this for years.

3819
03:36:44,909 --> 03:36:45,909
Go look at the tweet right now.

3820
03:36:45,909 --> 03:36:47,709
I'm gonna fucking, I'm framing this.

3821
03:36:47,709 --> 03:36:50,709
I'm literally going to frame that tweet from Dusk Dev.

3822
03:36:53,229 --> 03:36:55,989
No, I don't want, all right.

3823
03:36:55,989 --> 03:36:58,709
Can I just delete all the weapons besides the shotgun

3824
03:36:58,709 --> 03:37:01,510
and the, I don't wanna like, oh, right, right, right.

3825
03:37:01,510 --> 03:37:02,510
Yes.

3826
03:37:02,510 --> 03:37:03,469
Oh, sorry, that was loud.

3827
03:37:03,469 --> 03:37:05,829
Unequip all of your weapons.

3828
03:37:05,829 --> 03:37:07,670
That is definitely the way.

3829
03:37:09,430 --> 03:37:12,870
Yes, unequip all of your weapons.

3830
03:37:12,870 --> 03:37:14,670
That is definitely the way.

3831
03:37:14,670 --> 03:37:17,229
As the voice actor for this fight, making fun of me.

3832
03:37:18,629 --> 03:37:20,610
Bro, that looked like Battle Chess.

3833
03:37:23,500 --> 03:37:24,739
You can turn me back on.

3834
03:37:32,649 --> 03:37:35,659
Battle Chess.

3835
03:37:35,659 --> 03:37:37,180
Oh, that's, oh my God.

3836
03:37:37,180 --> 03:37:40,379
You just ruined Dark Souls 2 for me forever.

3837
03:37:40,379 --> 03:37:43,620
You just ruined Dark, I can't even play this again.

3838
03:37:43,620 --> 03:37:45,100
Andy funny voices.

3839
03:37:45,100 --> 03:37:47,079
You said that wrong.

3840
03:37:47,719 --> 03:37:48,559
Andy funny voices.

3841
03:37:48,559 --> 03:37:50,600
No, no, no, no, no, excuse me, I gotta correct you.

3842
03:37:50,600 --> 03:37:52,920
That's funny voice Andy.

3843
03:37:52,920 --> 03:37:55,100
Andy funny voices.

3844
03:37:55,100 --> 03:37:56,899
Andy funny voice, I love that.

3845
03:37:56,899 --> 03:37:58,739
That's my favorite comment of the week.

3846
03:37:58,739 --> 03:38:02,579
That's so, I love that wording.

3847
03:38:02,579 --> 03:38:04,420
Time that person up for five seconds.

3848
03:38:04,420 --> 03:38:08,420
If you lose, you have to get one of the gyros from Arby's.

3849
03:38:08,420 --> 03:38:10,260
I love this, this was so fun.

3850
03:38:10,260 --> 03:38:11,100
This was so fun.

3851
03:38:11,100 --> 03:38:12,799
Grossest fast food item.

3852
03:38:12,799 --> 03:38:14,620
You know what's crazy?

3853
03:38:14,620 --> 03:38:16,860
I don't want to eat fucking Arby's.

3854
03:38:16,860 --> 03:38:18,840
I don't want that at all.

3855
03:38:19,760 --> 03:38:20,600
I'm going to try as hard as I can.

3856
03:38:20,600 --> 03:38:25,180
I'm going to be silent now.

3857
03:38:25,180 --> 03:38:26,819
Oh shit.

3858
03:38:26,819 --> 03:38:28,780
Oh no, I don't want to go to Arby's.

3859
03:38:28,780 --> 03:38:34,600
I did it.

3860
03:38:34,600 --> 03:38:36,860
Sorry, Arby's fans.

3861
03:38:36,860 --> 03:38:38,219
Not tonight.

3862
03:38:38,219 --> 03:38:40,399
Causing havoc on the highway.

3863
03:38:40,399 --> 03:38:49,639
We're on break core for this.

3864
03:38:49,639 --> 03:38:51,680
Restart, restart the mission.

3865
03:38:51,680 --> 03:38:53,520
Restart the mission.

3866
03:38:53,520 --> 03:38:55,120
This is fucking with my head.

3867
03:38:55,120 --> 03:38:56,399
This is fucking with my head.

3868
03:38:56,399 --> 03:38:58,600
Imagine if the police were listening to this.

3869
03:39:09,510 --> 03:39:11,229
It's too fucked up.

3870
03:39:11,229 --> 03:39:18,479
It's too fucked up.

3871
03:39:18,479 --> 03:39:24,360
So there are a lot of funny people in this community.

3872
03:39:24,360 --> 03:39:25,680
I've known this for a long time.

3873
03:39:25,680 --> 03:39:28,159
This is not a secret.

3874
03:39:28,159 --> 03:39:31,899
The stuff that some of you guys come up with is insane.

3875
03:39:33,459 --> 03:39:36,700
I'm just sitting here watching and laughing along with you.

3876
03:39:39,329 --> 03:39:41,129
I couldn't ask for a more fun community.

3877
03:39:41,129 --> 03:39:46,079
Seriously, I love it.

3878
03:39:46,079 --> 03:39:49,079
Your winner of best one guy.

3879
03:39:49,079 --> 03:39:52,530
Remember one guy, you know who that is?

3880
03:39:52,530 --> 03:39:54,370
We all know, come on.

3881
03:39:55,750 --> 03:40:07,639
Your winner with 48.8, 49% of the vote.

3882
03:40:09,979 --> 03:40:11,379
It's Ball Fondler.

3883
03:40:11,379 --> 03:40:13,989
Of course it is.

3884
03:40:13,989 --> 03:40:15,829
Ball Fondler, congratulations.

3885
03:40:15,829 --> 03:40:19,090
You won best one guy moment of the year.

3886
03:40:19,090 --> 03:40:24,620
And then after that, 10%,

3887
03:40:24,620 --> 03:40:28,389
day one Elden Ring played at the bar.

3888
03:40:28,389 --> 03:40:30,629
And then 9%,

3889
03:40:30,629 --> 03:40:36,090
Stanley Parable Dev adds a spider into your mouth.

3890
03:40:36,969 --> 03:40:39,809
Barf Drinker, you would have had my vote Barf Drinker.

3891
03:40:39,809 --> 03:40:44,329
You were 1.7% behind that in fourth place.

3892
03:40:44,329 --> 03:40:49,479
This was one of the most least skipped categories.

3893
03:40:49,479 --> 03:40:51,600
Congratulations Ball Fondler

3894
03:40:51,600 --> 03:40:56,379
for making an unbelievable moment of the stream.

3895
03:40:56,379 --> 03:41:00,840
Ball Fondler has been banned like three times.

3896
03:41:02,600 --> 03:41:06,079
Ball Fondler's comments since then.

3897
03:41:06,079 --> 03:41:08,620
Do you know what they are?

3898
03:41:08,620 --> 03:41:11,360
Play Skyrim.

3899
03:41:11,360 --> 03:41:13,639
Okay, dude, are you gonna play Skyrim?

3900
03:41:13,639 --> 03:41:20,889
Hey, play World of Warcraft Dragon Flight.

3901
03:41:20,889 --> 03:41:24,049
I'm not gonna do probably, well, Skyrim maybe.

3902
03:41:24,930 --> 03:41:26,530
All right, moving right along.

3903
03:41:26,530 --> 03:41:29,729
We are getting to the top seven or eight categories

3904
03:41:29,729 --> 03:41:32,370
and they're getting juicy.

3905
03:41:32,370 --> 03:41:38,709
This next one, this one's got a lot of nominees.

3906
03:41:38,709 --> 03:41:40,989
What is it?

3907
03:41:40,989 --> 03:41:46,219
Yeah, congrats Ball Fondler, you made a fun moment.

3908
03:41:46,219 --> 03:41:48,700
Best scare moment of the year.

3909
03:41:48,700 --> 03:41:51,340
Horror games, jump scares,

3910
03:41:52,180 --> 03:41:54,899
scariness, anything that's freaked me out

3911
03:41:54,899 --> 03:41:55,860
could be nominated.

3912
03:41:57,780 --> 03:42:01,219
Here are your nominees for best scare of the year.

3913
03:42:10,479 --> 03:42:12,559
No, I just was doing that to freak out, you know,

3914
03:42:12,559 --> 03:42:15,420
like, you know, viddy, you know what I mean?

3915
03:42:15,420 --> 03:42:16,260
Ah!

3916
03:42:18,260 --> 03:42:20,860
Hi, I'm just playing, I was doing my task.

3917
03:42:34,629 --> 03:42:39,629
I started to like look this way and this eye,

3918
03:42:40,549 --> 03:42:43,629
I went like, I went reverse cross,

3919
03:42:43,629 --> 03:42:48,069
I went frog eye for a second.

3920
03:42:48,069 --> 03:42:51,440
Did he leave the room?

3921
03:42:51,440 --> 03:42:56,319
Holy God, this guy sucks.

3922
03:42:56,319 --> 03:43:05,690
Ah!

3923
03:43:05,690 --> 03:43:09,200
Back, but this, ah!

3924
03:43:09,200 --> 03:43:10,520
God, I'm so sorry, holy shit,

3925
03:43:10,520 --> 03:43:18,760
that was like the worst thing that ever happened to me.

3926
03:43:18,760 --> 03:43:22,479
What the flying fuck are you doing, lady?

3927
03:43:22,479 --> 03:43:23,600
I'm just going up the stairs,

3928
03:43:23,600 --> 03:43:25,280
I don't give a shit if he hears me.

3929
03:43:29,750 --> 03:43:31,280
Oh!

3930
03:43:33,280 --> 03:43:34,639
I thought he was downstairs.

3931
03:43:36,360 --> 03:43:39,239
Oh my God, that was the worst thing ever.

3932
03:43:39,239 --> 03:43:41,040
That was probably the worst thing ever.

3933
03:43:52,129 --> 03:43:54,489
Ah!

3934
03:43:54,489 --> 03:43:55,329
In a circle.

3935
03:43:58,360 --> 03:44:01,639
That was the chicken, that was the fucking rooster.

3936
03:44:01,639 --> 03:44:04,040
That was a rooster, that was actually a rooster.

3937
03:44:04,040 --> 03:44:06,079
I don't know what that means, but whatever.

3938
03:44:07,889 --> 03:44:09,569
Jesus Christ, dude.

3939
03:44:12,459 --> 03:44:14,120
Where is he?

3940
03:44:14,120 --> 03:44:15,280
Whoa!

3941
03:44:15,280 --> 03:44:18,040
Oh, the fucking thing, the drape.

3942
03:44:18,040 --> 03:44:20,959
I thought like a tentacle came down and grabbed me.

3943
03:44:23,860 --> 03:44:25,219
What the fuck, dude, why?

3944
03:44:25,219 --> 03:44:28,139
Now I'm like, I'm all cracked out now.

3945
03:44:28,139 --> 03:44:30,989
Holy shit.

3946
03:44:30,989 --> 03:44:32,309
What the fuck?

3947
03:44:32,309 --> 03:44:33,899
Ah!

3948
03:44:33,899 --> 03:44:34,899
It's like a monster.

3949
03:44:43,000 --> 03:44:46,049
It's just sound effects, it's not even, nothing here.

3950
03:44:46,049 --> 03:44:51,139
There's nothing here.

3951
03:44:51,139 --> 03:44:52,139
Oh my God, it's a bat.

3952
03:44:52,139 --> 03:45:00,959
Hey!

3953
03:45:03,680 --> 03:45:05,280
I got a frying pan.

3954
03:45:05,280 --> 03:45:06,680
Oh shit.

3955
03:45:06,680 --> 03:45:08,360
I have what's it called, flash.

3956
03:45:08,360 --> 03:45:09,360
I could throw it at everyone.

3957
03:45:09,360 --> 03:45:11,319
I've got six minis.

3958
03:45:11,319 --> 03:45:12,159
Oh!

3959
03:45:12,159 --> 03:45:15,000
Run, I'm sorry, I don't know how to skip this run.

3960
03:45:15,040 --> 03:45:16,840
I don't know, I went in the dumpster.

3961
03:45:16,840 --> 03:45:17,680
It's okay.

3962
03:45:19,680 --> 03:45:21,120
I thought you were getting killed.

3963
03:45:21,120 --> 03:45:22,239
No, I thought I was dead, dude.

3964
03:45:22,239 --> 03:45:23,079
I was like, what the fuck?

3965
03:45:23,079 --> 03:45:24,040
Somebody like sniped me.

3966
03:45:24,040 --> 03:45:24,959
It was terrifying.

3967
03:45:28,989 --> 03:45:35,440
Oh!

3968
03:45:57,170 --> 03:46:00,409
That would be a fucked up start to Mickey Mouse's clubhouse.

3969
03:46:12,670 --> 03:46:18,250
Where do I go from here?

3970
03:46:18,250 --> 03:46:23,600
Okay, turn it off.

3971
03:46:23,600 --> 03:46:28,620
Turn that off, close it up.

3972
03:46:28,620 --> 03:46:37,569
What?

3973
03:46:43,000 --> 03:46:45,120
I'm wearing the same sweater too.

3974
03:46:46,040 --> 03:46:47,520
I have the same clothes on.

3975
03:46:50,430 --> 03:46:51,829
Relax, holy shit, dude.

3976
03:46:51,829 --> 03:46:52,989
Are you kidding me?

3977
03:46:52,989 --> 03:46:55,120
This is not even scary.

3978
03:46:55,120 --> 03:46:56,000
Did I just fake that?

3979
03:46:56,000 --> 03:46:57,360
No, I really didn't, I swear to God,

3980
03:46:57,360 --> 03:46:58,719
but like that was way over,

3981
03:46:58,719 --> 03:47:00,760
I haven't played a scary game in a long time.

3982
03:47:12,180 --> 03:47:14,659
Oh my God, how am I alive?

3983
03:47:14,659 --> 03:47:17,459
I am absolutely, I was like, what are you pointing at?

3984
03:47:27,399 --> 03:47:28,239
It's a cliff.

3985
03:47:36,000 --> 03:47:40,930
What?

3986
03:47:40,930 --> 03:47:41,770
Jesus.

3987
03:47:46,290 --> 03:47:48,250
I just shot down my computer.

3988
03:47:48,250 --> 03:47:50,010
I think I shot my computer.

3989
03:47:50,010 --> 03:47:58,040
I think I shot my computer down.

3990
03:47:58,040 --> 03:48:01,760
Wow, a lot of scares this year.

3991
03:48:01,760 --> 03:48:04,879
A lot of scares.

3992
03:48:04,879 --> 03:48:06,760
I wanna know what you guys picked.

3993
03:48:07,639 --> 03:48:10,950
No fanfare, let's go.

3994
03:48:10,950 --> 03:48:11,909
Yeah.

3995
03:48:15,000 --> 03:48:18,120
It technically happened last year.

3996
03:48:19,319 --> 03:48:21,680
Wearing the same clothes.

3997
03:48:22,399 --> 03:48:27,399
The volume warning puppet combo scare with 20% of the vote.

3998
03:48:27,399 --> 03:48:30,040
It's the one where it looked like I saw a mouse

3999
03:48:30,040 --> 03:48:32,739
go through the bottom of the screen there.

4000
03:48:32,739 --> 03:48:36,700
Yeah, it looks like, yeah, I mean, come on.

4001
03:48:36,700 --> 03:48:39,700
A Charborg corner jump scare with Among Us

4002
03:48:39,700 --> 03:48:43,299
is at 13.7, number two, 13.7.

4003
03:48:43,299 --> 03:48:48,299
And then Iron Lung at 7.3% number three.

4004
03:48:48,700 --> 03:48:51,940
The cutoff of the awards was right

4005
03:48:51,940 --> 03:48:54,420
at that puppet combo stream last year.

4006
03:48:54,420 --> 03:48:58,940
So, honestly, I think a couple of years came off my life

4007
03:48:58,940 --> 03:49:00,579
after that.

4008
03:49:00,579 --> 03:49:04,190
I felt awful after that stream.

4009
03:49:04,190 --> 03:49:07,110
I think I remember talking about it later,

4010
03:49:07,110 --> 03:49:10,170
being like, I feel bad, I feel awful.

4011
03:49:10,170 --> 03:49:12,329
I have a headache, my chest hurts.

4012
03:49:12,329 --> 03:49:15,360
It actually felt terrible after that.

4013
03:49:15,360 --> 03:49:19,559
Anyways, we are getting to the final seven awards.

4014
03:49:19,559 --> 03:49:21,600
This is getting juicy.

4015
03:49:21,600 --> 03:49:23,799
I've said that four or five times, but it is.

4016
03:49:24,879 --> 03:49:29,520
Time to get to the big ones.

4017
03:49:29,520 --> 03:49:34,760
Now, every year, I like to sing some songs.

4018
03:49:34,920 --> 03:49:39,920
I sing, I get involved, I enunciate.

4019
03:49:41,690 --> 03:49:44,489
And we are going to show you now some of those nominees

4020
03:49:44,489 --> 03:49:46,930
for what that means when it's good.

4021
03:49:46,930 --> 03:49:49,840
Not bad when it's good.

4022
03:49:49,840 --> 03:49:54,840
Here are your nominees for the best singing of the year.

4023
03:50:00,139 --> 03:50:05,319
Hopefully, it's good, because I haven't seen this.

4024
03:50:05,319 --> 03:50:06,799
Bo peep, bo peep, bo peep, bo.

4025
03:50:06,799 --> 03:50:10,799
Bo peep, bo peep, bo peep, bo.

4026
03:50:10,799 --> 03:50:14,159
You got a friend in me.

4027
03:50:14,159 --> 03:50:15,000
This is on the other one, too.

4028
03:50:15,000 --> 03:50:15,840
This is on four singing back.

4029
03:50:15,840 --> 03:50:17,799
You got a friend in me.

4030
03:50:20,299 --> 03:50:23,899
When the road looks rubberhead

4031
03:50:23,940 --> 03:50:28,659
And you're miles and miles from your nice, warm bed.

4032
03:50:29,920 --> 03:50:33,600
You just remember what your old pal said.

4033
03:50:33,600 --> 03:50:36,959
But you got a friend in me.

4034
03:51:01,370 --> 03:51:06,370
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

4035
03:51:06,610 --> 03:51:07,969
Are you playing Dark Souls?

4036
03:51:07,969 --> 03:51:09,809
Hey son, what a game you're playing.

4037
03:51:10,530 --> 03:51:14,559
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

4038
03:51:14,559 --> 03:51:16,239
Oh, I wonder.

4039
03:51:16,239 --> 03:51:19,559
The only thing I remember from Arcane was

4040
03:51:19,559 --> 03:51:21,879
Oh, the misery.

4041
03:51:21,879 --> 03:51:24,079
Every single person is my enemy.

4042
03:51:25,280 --> 03:51:26,520
That's all. That's the only thing I know.

4043
03:51:26,520 --> 03:51:33,280
I don't know anything else.

4044
03:51:33,280 --> 03:51:35,760
You gotta find that mystery.

4045
03:51:35,760 --> 03:51:37,600
And this is Scooby Doo.

4046
03:51:37,600 --> 03:51:39,239
Coming after you.

4047
03:51:39,239 --> 03:51:41,360
Fuck the Scooby Doo.

4048
03:51:41,360 --> 03:51:42,840
This is the fucking new Zoomer shit.

4049
03:51:42,840 --> 03:51:44,479
This is not what I want.

4050
03:51:45,440 --> 03:51:49,549
To the streets.

4051
03:51:49,549 --> 03:51:51,670
You got me up the cigarette.

4052
03:51:51,670 --> 03:51:53,670
Is that sceptre on my feet?

4053
03:51:54,790 --> 03:51:56,989
You need to find a reason.

4054
03:51:56,989 --> 03:51:59,469
Reason things went wrong.

4055
03:51:59,469 --> 03:52:03,670
Got to find a reason why my money's all gone.

4056
03:52:03,670 --> 03:52:04,510
Oh!

4057
03:52:07,079 --> 03:52:09,399
I could still get high.

4058
03:52:09,399 --> 03:52:13,920
And I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot.

4059
03:52:14,879 --> 03:52:17,159
Not this one.

4060
03:52:17,159 --> 03:52:18,000
Hope not.

4061
03:52:39,360 --> 03:52:41,760
Scared.

4062
03:52:41,760 --> 03:52:44,969
That's what you want.

4063
03:52:44,969 --> 03:52:47,809
I'm going to march out here and just start singing fucking

4064
03:52:47,809 --> 03:52:54,319
John Jingleheimer Schmidt.

4065
03:52:54,319 --> 03:52:55,159
What are you doing now?

4066
03:52:55,159 --> 03:52:57,180
You're supposed to be scared.

4067
03:52:57,180 --> 03:53:00,459
John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt.

4068
03:53:00,459 --> 03:53:03,500
His name is my name too.

4069
03:53:03,500 --> 03:53:04,340
That's bad.

4070
03:53:04,340 --> 03:53:06,979
Whenever we go out, we always shout.

4071
03:53:06,979 --> 03:53:10,020
Here comes John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt.

4072
03:53:10,020 --> 03:53:10,860
Why is this?

4073
03:53:11,379 --> 03:53:12,780
Get in the bathroom quick.

4074
03:53:12,780 --> 03:53:13,620
This is terrible.

4075
03:53:13,620 --> 03:53:14,500
Chat a la la bye.

4076
03:53:17,379 --> 03:53:18,459
Little baby, I don't see a burn.

4077
03:53:18,459 --> 03:53:19,579
I'm going to buy you a mugging burn.

4078
03:53:19,579 --> 03:53:20,739
If that mugging bird don't sing,

4079
03:53:20,739 --> 03:53:21,819
I'm going to buy you an iron ring.

4080
03:53:21,819 --> 03:53:22,979
If that diamond ring don't shine,

4081
03:53:22,979 --> 03:53:28,930
I'm going to buy you a glass of wine.

4082
03:53:28,930 --> 03:53:31,290
When you get old enough, over 21.

4083
03:53:31,290 --> 03:53:34,479
We're getting apples and bananas remix.

4084
03:53:34,479 --> 03:53:36,000
Are you talking about like the...

4085
03:53:36,000 --> 03:53:40,760
I want to eat, eat, eat apples and bananas.

4086
03:53:40,760 --> 03:53:41,879
That's what you mean.

4087
03:53:41,879 --> 03:53:45,680
I like to eat, eat, eat, eight percent banana.

4088
03:53:47,239 --> 03:53:50,479
And feel like I belong.

4089
03:53:50,479 --> 03:53:52,040
Oh, this one's good.

4090
03:53:52,040 --> 03:53:52,879
This one's good.

4091
03:53:52,879 --> 03:53:57,530
Way, I can go the distance.

4092
03:53:57,530 --> 03:54:01,030
I'll be there someday.

4093
03:54:01,030 --> 03:54:04,149
If I can be strong,

4094
03:54:04,149 --> 03:54:07,549
I know every mile

4095
03:54:07,549 --> 03:54:12,520
will be worth my while.

4096
03:54:12,520 --> 03:54:16,440
He would go most anywhere

4097
03:54:16,440 --> 03:54:28,700
to feel like I belong.

4098
03:54:28,700 --> 03:54:31,440
Well, I liked that last one.

4099
03:54:31,440 --> 03:54:33,280
That was pretty good.

4100
03:54:33,280 --> 03:54:35,360
Well, we'll see what you think.

4101
03:54:35,360 --> 03:54:36,200
Ladies and gentlemen,

4102
03:54:36,200 --> 03:54:39,319
the winner of best singing of the year is...

4103
03:54:39,319 --> 03:54:43,950
I don't know if production has it ready,

4104
03:54:43,950 --> 03:54:46,829
but you know, I'll just wait till you do.

4105
03:54:46,829 --> 03:54:48,750
Can we just put, can we just play?

4106
03:54:48,750 --> 03:54:50,430
Can we just play it?

4107
03:54:50,430 --> 03:54:53,120
Can we just play it?

4108
03:54:53,120 --> 03:54:54,440
Do you know what won?

4109
03:54:54,440 --> 03:54:55,399
Can we just play it through?

4110
03:54:55,399 --> 03:54:56,399
DMCA, I know.

4111
03:54:56,399 --> 03:55:00,569
The channel will get shut down, but who gives a shit?

4112
03:55:00,569 --> 03:55:01,930
They don't have it.

4113
03:55:01,930 --> 03:55:06,930
Okay, it's with 31.1%, 31% of the vote is,

4114
03:55:08,350 --> 03:55:12,430
oh, the misery.

4115
03:55:12,430 --> 03:55:13,670
Okay.

4116
03:55:13,670 --> 03:55:16,110
At number two with 25%,

4117
03:55:16,110 --> 03:55:18,870
all the Hatsune Miku fans, po-pi-po.

4118
03:55:18,870 --> 03:55:20,549
And then Hercules, go the distance,

4119
03:55:20,549 --> 03:55:22,510
which was actually the good one.

4120
03:55:22,510 --> 03:55:24,389
That was the good one.

4121
03:55:24,389 --> 03:55:28,590
At 9.85%, good job, by the way, good job.

4122
03:55:28,629 --> 03:55:30,030
There you go.

4123
03:55:30,030 --> 03:55:33,270
But now, I do wanna do something very special.

4124
03:55:34,350 --> 03:55:36,069
We saw them earlier,

4125
03:55:36,069 --> 03:55:38,709
didn't really get a chance to show off

4126
03:55:38,709 --> 03:55:40,510
what they could actually do.

4127
03:55:40,510 --> 03:55:42,870
Feel like it's a good place to do it though.

4128
03:55:42,870 --> 03:55:47,030
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome back into the studio,

4129
03:55:47,030 --> 03:55:55,079
Top Shelf Vocal, couple of actual good songs here.

4130
03:55:55,079 --> 03:55:58,319
And I'm gonna get outta here because I shouldn't be here.

4131
03:55:58,319 --> 03:56:00,520
Santa did tell me to be better.

4132
03:56:00,520 --> 03:56:02,959
Top Shelf Vocal, ladies and gentlemen,

4133
03:56:02,959 --> 03:56:12,510
with a couple of songs.

4134
03:56:12,510 --> 03:56:17,110
Joy to the world, the Lord is come.

4135
03:56:17,110 --> 03:56:21,670
Let earth receive her King.

4136
03:56:21,670 --> 03:56:26,229
Let every heart prepare Him room.

4137
03:56:26,229 --> 03:56:28,389
And heaven and nature sing.

4138
03:56:28,389 --> 03:56:30,590
And heaven and nature sing.

4139
03:56:30,590 --> 03:56:35,229
And heaven and nature sing.

4140
03:56:35,229 --> 03:56:39,430
Joy to the earth, the Savior reigns.

4141
03:56:39,430 --> 03:56:43,790
Let men their songs employ.

4142
03:56:43,790 --> 03:56:48,270
Rock fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains.

4143
03:56:48,270 --> 03:56:50,430
Repeat the sounding joy.

4144
03:56:50,430 --> 03:56:52,629
Repeat the sounding joy.

4145
03:56:52,629 --> 03:56:57,309
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.

4146
03:56:57,309 --> 03:57:01,549
He rules the world with truth and grace.

4147
03:57:01,549 --> 03:57:05,840
And makes the nations prove

4148
03:57:05,840 --> 03:57:10,280
the glories of His righteousness.

4149
03:57:10,280 --> 03:57:12,479
And wonders of His love.

4150
03:57:12,479 --> 03:57:14,719
And wonders of His love.

4151
03:57:14,719 --> 03:57:21,440
And wonders, wonders of His love.

4152
03:57:21,440 --> 03:57:26,670
Thank you.

4153
03:57:26,670 --> 03:57:32,299
Thank you so much for bringing some joy to the world.

4154
03:57:32,299 --> 03:57:33,860
We're gonna slow it down just a little bit

4155
03:57:33,860 --> 03:57:48,399
because tonight we want to bring in a holy night.

4156
03:57:48,440 --> 03:57:57,309
Oh, the stars are brightly shining.

4157
03:57:57,309 --> 03:58:06,290
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth.

4158
03:58:06,290 --> 03:58:15,049
Long lay the world in sin and error pining.

4159
03:58:15,049 --> 03:58:23,809
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth.

4160
03:58:23,889 --> 03:58:31,770
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices.

4161
03:58:31,770 --> 03:58:39,680
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.

4162
03:58:39,680 --> 03:58:47,280
Fall on your knees.

4163
03:58:47,319 --> 03:58:55,120
Oh, hear the angel voices.

4164
03:58:55,120 --> 03:59:02,489
Oh, night divine.

4165
03:59:02,489 --> 03:59:10,600
Oh, when Christ was born.

4166
03:59:10,600 --> 03:59:15,280
Oh, night.

4167
03:59:15,280 --> 03:59:21,889
Oh, holy night.

4168
03:59:21,889 --> 03:59:28,010
Oh, night divine.

4169
03:59:28,010 --> 03:59:33,690
Thank you all so much.

4170
03:59:33,690 --> 03:59:34,209
Thank you.

4171
03:59:34,209 --> 03:59:34,969
Yeah.

4172
03:59:34,969 --> 03:59:36,329
Happy holidays to all.

4173
03:59:36,329 --> 03:59:36,889
Thank you.

4174
03:59:36,889 --> 03:59:37,809
Yeah, thank you for having us.

4175
03:59:37,809 --> 03:59:38,649
Thank you for having us.

4176
03:59:38,649 --> 03:59:39,409
Appreciate it.

4177
03:59:39,409 --> 03:59:41,569
That was absolutely unbelievable.

4178
03:59:41,569 --> 03:59:42,090
Thank you.

4179
03:59:42,090 --> 03:59:42,729
Thank you.

4180
03:59:42,729 --> 03:59:46,409
You all out here to actually do a song.

4181
03:59:46,409 --> 03:59:49,889
So with that, now don't listen.

4182
03:59:49,889 --> 03:59:52,290
I want you guys to don't listen to this.

4183
03:59:52,290 --> 03:59:55,530
We're going to go to the next category, which is maybe

4184
03:59:55,530 --> 03:59:57,569
the worst singing of the year.

4185
03:59:57,569 --> 03:59:59,729
Maybe I sing.

4186
03:59:59,729 --> 04:00:00,370
You've heard me.

4187
04:00:00,370 --> 04:00:02,090
I've sung before a few times.

4188
04:00:02,090 --> 04:00:03,170
Yeah, a couple of times.

4189
04:00:03,170 --> 04:00:04,409
Yeah.

4190
04:00:04,409 --> 04:00:08,569
Here are your nominees for the worst singing of the year,

4191
04:00:08,569 --> 04:00:11,049
right after that great performance.

4192
04:00:11,049 --> 04:00:15,620
You guys killed it.

4193
04:00:15,620 --> 04:00:24,760
That was fucking amazing.

4194
04:00:24,760 --> 04:00:29,200
Somebody said, Bjork?

4195
04:00:29,200 --> 04:00:31,000
What do you mean, Bjork?

4196
04:00:31,000 --> 04:00:32,799
I don't sound like Bjork.

4197
04:00:32,799 --> 04:00:33,879
What do you mean?

4198
04:00:33,879 --> 04:00:36,760
All I think is sing.

4199
04:00:36,760 --> 04:00:39,770
We're shouting in the wind.

4200
04:00:39,770 --> 04:00:44,920
And then somebody says, Bjork.

4201
04:00:44,920 --> 04:00:48,500
And I'm like, ugh.

4202
04:00:48,500 --> 04:00:56,250
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

4203
04:00:56,250 --> 04:01:00,879
Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum.

4204
04:01:00,879 --> 04:01:02,719
Take a punch to the face.

4205
04:01:02,719 --> 04:01:12,319
We're all good friends, and we all get together sometimes.

4206
04:01:12,319 --> 04:01:15,079
When you're feeling down and you're feeling out of luck

4207
04:01:15,079 --> 04:01:19,360
and out of change, we will work together and we will help.

4208
04:01:19,360 --> 04:01:20,360
I'm sorry.

4209
04:01:20,360 --> 04:01:21,680
That's what I expected.

4210
04:01:21,680 --> 04:01:22,680
That's what I expected.

4211
04:01:22,680 --> 04:01:24,200
I expected that.

4212
04:01:24,200 --> 04:01:26,159
She's such a misfit.

4213
04:01:26,159 --> 04:01:27,440
Always ready to fight.

4214
04:01:27,479 --> 04:01:31,159
She's got a super beam, and she's raising high

4215
04:01:31,159 --> 04:01:35,489
if you believe you're strong.

4216
04:01:35,489 --> 04:01:37,049
Do you know the whole song?

4217
04:01:37,049 --> 04:01:37,889
I don't know.

4218
04:01:37,889 --> 04:01:39,930
I heard like a minute of it.

4219
04:01:39,930 --> 04:01:46,530
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

4220
04:01:46,530 --> 04:01:49,959
Sing a good night song for Boba.

4221
04:01:49,959 --> 04:01:56,540
Boba, the kitty, have a good rest.

4222
04:01:56,540 --> 04:02:00,299
See you in the morning.

4223
04:02:00,299 --> 04:02:05,629
Boba, such a good kitty.

4224
04:02:05,629 --> 04:02:08,829
See you in the morning.

4225
04:02:08,829 --> 04:02:11,590
Good morning, good morning, good morning to you all.

4226
04:02:11,590 --> 04:02:14,600
Good morning, good morning.

4227
04:02:14,600 --> 04:02:17,379
I'm going to take a fall.

4228
04:02:17,379 --> 04:02:20,579
It's such a wonderful world we live in, in this nice street.

4229
04:02:20,579 --> 04:02:21,420
We're almost there.

4230
04:02:21,420 --> 04:02:24,000
Here we are.

4231
04:02:24,000 --> 04:02:25,440
Oh, they're missing me.

4232
04:02:25,440 --> 04:02:31,829
Every, every, my, every single person is my enemy.

4233
04:02:31,829 --> 04:02:33,309
Here it goes, here it goes.

4234
04:02:33,309 --> 04:02:35,950
We go from Nashville to Norway,

4235
04:02:35,950 --> 04:02:42,069
to Zimbabwe, Chicago, Czechoslovakia, and back.

4236
04:02:42,069 --> 04:02:45,909
But she'll be like...

4237
04:02:45,909 --> 04:02:49,360
Fucking god damn it.

4238
04:02:49,360 --> 04:02:52,079
The weather outside is bright.

4239
04:02:52,079 --> 04:02:52,799
What's wrong with this?

4240
04:02:52,799 --> 04:02:56,840
I got fire, solar light.

4241
04:02:56,840 --> 04:03:00,079
Since we know place.

4242
04:03:00,079 --> 04:03:01,340
Hold on.

4243
04:03:01,340 --> 04:03:03,059
Since we know place.

4244
04:03:03,059 --> 04:03:03,860
I'll get it.

4245
04:03:03,860 --> 04:03:05,350
Shut up.

4246
04:03:05,350 --> 04:03:08,350
Since we know place to go.

4247
04:03:08,350 --> 04:03:11,790
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.

4248
04:03:11,790 --> 04:03:13,149
Use that part.

4249
04:03:13,149 --> 04:03:13,790
What was wrong with that?

4250
04:03:13,790 --> 04:03:17,290
That was fine.

4251
04:03:17,290 --> 04:03:20,979
You've got a friend in me.

4252
04:03:20,979 --> 04:03:23,569
Got a friend in me.

4253
04:03:23,569 --> 04:03:25,270
Two people.

4254
04:03:25,270 --> 04:03:28,430
Having one of a life and I have...

4255
04:03:28,430 --> 04:03:31,549
That's it, right?

4256
04:03:31,549 --> 04:03:33,270
All right, I'm going to count you guys in, OK?

4257
04:03:33,270 --> 04:03:35,510
Three, two, one, go.

4258
04:03:35,510 --> 04:03:39,110
She sang over the hills.

4259
04:03:39,110 --> 04:03:43,270
It instantly voice jammered me.

4260
04:03:43,270 --> 04:03:44,309
Take your headphones out.

4261
04:03:44,309 --> 04:03:45,670
Wait, wait, wait.

4262
04:03:45,670 --> 04:03:46,309
Sorry, sorry.

4263
04:03:46,309 --> 04:03:47,469
Take out your headphones.

4264
04:03:47,469 --> 04:03:47,870
OK.

4265
04:03:47,870 --> 04:03:48,909
Ready?

4266
04:03:48,909 --> 04:03:50,989
Three, two, one.

4267
04:03:50,989 --> 04:03:52,870
She sang over the hills.

4268
04:03:52,870 --> 04:03:56,149
Peaks are shy, but sure dawn.

4269
04:03:56,149 --> 04:03:59,950
And sure as the sun rise, I'll someday be gone.

4270
04:03:59,950 --> 04:04:05,270
But recall me, my love, and our joy may live on.

4271
04:04:05,270 --> 04:04:10,549
And you do, and you do, and you do.

4272
04:04:10,549 --> 04:04:11,309
That's a howl at the end.

4273
04:04:11,309 --> 04:04:22,440
There has to be a howl at the end.

4274
04:04:22,440 --> 04:04:26,540
Some of those weren't that bad.

4275
04:04:26,540 --> 04:04:27,979
I mean, cringe.

4276
04:04:27,979 --> 04:04:30,139
Is it like a most cringe category?

4277
04:04:30,139 --> 04:04:33,430
Maybe, no?

4278
04:04:33,430 --> 04:04:41,270
I have to top the shelf vocal, I know.

4279
04:04:41,270 --> 04:04:44,559
These were close.

4280
04:04:44,559 --> 04:04:47,649
It was pretty much every single nominee.

4281
04:04:47,649 --> 04:04:54,690
15.5, 14.4, 13.9, 13, 12.

4282
04:04:54,690 --> 04:04:55,569
It's all of them.

4283
04:04:55,569 --> 04:04:57,629
You couldn't choose.

4284
04:04:57,629 --> 04:05:02,239
But if you had to, with 15.5% of the vote, it's Björk.

4285
04:05:02,239 --> 04:05:04,040
Björk wins.

4286
04:05:04,040 --> 04:05:10,270
And then right underneath that 14.4% was Beatbox O,

4287
04:05:10,270 --> 04:05:11,909
The Misery.

4288
04:05:11,909 --> 04:05:20,209
And then 13.9% was the Splatoon 3 laughing song.

4289
04:05:20,209 --> 04:05:24,729
I mean, the Björk.

4290
04:05:24,729 --> 04:05:26,610
That stream, I would have nominated

4291
04:05:26,610 --> 04:05:28,829
for worst stream of the year.

4292
04:05:28,870 --> 04:05:30,639
Is it in there?

4293
04:05:30,639 --> 04:05:32,680
It might be.

4294
04:05:32,680 --> 04:05:35,120
All right, let's count the categories.

4295
04:05:35,120 --> 04:05:38,840
We've got one, two, three, four, five.

4296
04:05:38,840 --> 04:05:40,959
We've got, what, five or six categories remaining?

4297
04:05:40,959 --> 04:05:42,909
These are the huge ones.

4298
04:05:42,909 --> 04:05:45,829
These are the major, massive categories.

4299
04:05:48,170 --> 04:05:49,870
Are you ready?

4300
04:05:49,870 --> 04:05:51,190
How you guys feel?

4301
04:05:51,190 --> 04:05:52,829
You guys in the Christmas spirit?

4302
04:05:52,829 --> 04:05:55,559
Holiday spirit?

4303
04:05:55,559 --> 04:05:57,280
Yeah?

4304
04:05:57,280 --> 04:05:59,100
Can you please do a Björk?

4305
04:05:59,100 --> 04:06:02,930
Yeah.

4306
04:06:02,930 --> 04:06:08,700
I should shine more than fire.

4307
04:06:08,700 --> 04:06:10,760
Pretty good.

4308
04:06:10,760 --> 04:06:12,930
Pretty good.

4309
04:06:12,930 --> 04:06:15,840
I tried.

4310
04:06:15,840 --> 04:06:18,520
Björk is a very talented singer, by the way.

4311
04:06:18,520 --> 04:06:21,159
More talented than I will ever be.

4312
04:06:21,159 --> 04:06:22,979
Times 100.

4313
04:06:22,979 --> 04:06:24,180
Just make that clear.

4314
04:06:24,180 --> 04:06:26,020
I have nothing on Björk.

4315
04:06:26,020 --> 04:06:32,079
Zero.

4316
04:06:32,079 --> 04:06:34,430
What's that say?

4317
04:06:34,430 --> 04:06:38,239
That is best gamer moment of the year.

4318
04:06:38,239 --> 04:06:39,920
Did I do good in a game?

4319
04:06:39,920 --> 04:06:43,700
Did I play Call of Duty versus a hacker?

4320
04:06:43,700 --> 04:06:45,940
Who may have been cheating, we don't know.

4321
04:06:47,709 --> 04:06:51,389
See him for lunch or dinner on Friday.

4322
04:06:51,389 --> 04:06:55,280
Extinguisher, if you still hear me.

4323
04:06:55,280 --> 04:06:57,840
I like extra lettuce on my hamburgers.

4324
04:06:57,840 --> 04:07:00,200
I like crunch.

4325
04:07:00,200 --> 04:07:02,159
Best gamer moment of the year incoming.

4326
04:07:02,159 --> 04:07:06,120
These are the moments that I actually did very well.

4327
04:07:06,120 --> 04:07:07,360
Not this one.

4328
04:07:07,360 --> 04:07:08,399
Don't look at that one yet.

4329
04:07:08,399 --> 04:07:09,799
It's not time for that one.

4330
04:07:09,799 --> 04:07:11,399
We're gonna put that down

4331
04:07:11,399 --> 04:07:12,840
and we're gonna show you the nominees

4332
04:07:12,840 --> 04:07:16,879
for best gaming moment of the year.

4333
04:07:16,879 --> 04:07:20,000
This is when I did well.

4334
04:07:20,000 --> 04:07:21,200
Here are your nominees.

4335
04:07:23,909 --> 04:07:25,629
Somebody's probably actually insane.

4336
04:07:25,629 --> 04:07:30,139
Banned that person for an hour.

4337
04:07:30,139 --> 04:07:31,739
And then like, you bet like a little bit there.

4338
04:07:31,739 --> 04:07:33,780
And then maybe I'd be like, you know,

4339
04:07:33,780 --> 04:07:36,739
what's 50 more?

4340
04:07:36,739 --> 04:07:37,579
You know what I mean?

4341
04:07:37,579 --> 04:07:39,180
It's a nominal amount.

4342
04:07:39,180 --> 04:07:40,260
It's a nominal amount.

4343
04:07:40,260 --> 04:07:41,500
Somebody said Elmo.

4344
04:07:42,500 --> 04:07:43,860
What does that mean?

4345
04:07:43,860 --> 04:07:49,340
Oh, Jerma, you absolute idiot.

4346
04:07:49,340 --> 04:07:50,340
Am I stupid?

4347
04:07:50,340 --> 04:07:57,620
Cause I just won the game.

4348
04:07:57,620 --> 04:08:00,079
That's a three of a kind.

4349
04:08:00,079 --> 04:08:01,239
You just got shocked.

4350
04:08:11,280 --> 04:08:12,319
Were you here?

4351
04:08:12,319 --> 04:08:13,879
Were you in the room?

4352
04:08:13,879 --> 04:08:15,979
Were you in the fucking room?

4353
04:08:15,979 --> 04:08:17,579
I got a bet for you.

4354
04:08:17,579 --> 04:08:20,379
And I complete my own mini golf course

4355
04:08:20,379 --> 04:08:23,520
in less than 20 strokes.

4356
04:08:23,520 --> 04:08:28,719
Six and seven.

4357
04:08:28,719 --> 04:08:30,959
Here comes seven.

4358
04:08:30,959 --> 04:08:32,479
Motherfuckers, you didn't think

4359
04:08:32,479 --> 04:08:38,680
I was gonna skip the whole goddamn course?

4360
04:08:38,680 --> 04:08:39,520
Yes.

4361
04:08:46,149 --> 04:08:47,790
You all lose.

4362
04:08:47,790 --> 04:08:49,790
You all lose.

4363
04:08:49,790 --> 04:08:51,870
Never bet against me again.

4364
04:08:52,790 --> 04:08:53,790
What's happening?

4365
04:08:53,790 --> 04:08:54,629
Am I winning?

4366
04:08:56,639 --> 04:08:57,840
Am I beating them?

4367
04:08:57,840 --> 04:08:58,719
I don't know.

4368
04:09:08,879 --> 04:09:12,989
Did I win?

4369
04:09:12,989 --> 04:09:17,889
Why won't he fight me?

4370
04:09:17,889 --> 04:09:20,979
Hurry up, run.

4371
04:09:20,979 --> 04:09:21,819
God damn it.

4372
04:09:21,819 --> 04:09:25,639
I knew it was a problem.

4373
04:09:25,639 --> 04:09:27,239
I have to be off to this guy

4374
04:09:27,239 --> 04:09:28,799
before he rings the alarm.

4375
04:09:33,049 --> 04:09:33,889
Come on.

4376
04:09:38,489 --> 04:09:46,040
Why is he so much faster than me?

4377
04:09:46,040 --> 04:09:58,139
I got him.

4378
04:09:58,139 --> 04:10:06,229
I beat him.

4379
04:10:06,229 --> 04:10:08,870
It's a pretty good moments.

4380
04:10:08,870 --> 04:10:10,670
That game is so hard.

4381
04:10:10,670 --> 04:10:13,239
They made it too hard.

4382
04:10:13,239 --> 04:10:16,319
Ultra kill devs if you're watching.

4383
04:10:16,319 --> 04:10:19,079
Your game is too hard.

4384
04:10:19,079 --> 04:10:20,920
Hardest game at Walmart.

4385
04:10:20,920 --> 04:10:24,159
It's not even at Walmart.

4386
04:10:24,159 --> 04:10:26,159
No, that's an old callback.

4387
04:10:26,159 --> 04:10:28,440
The game's hard, just to let you know.

4388
04:10:28,440 --> 04:10:29,479
Anyways, ladies and gentlemen,

4389
04:10:29,479 --> 04:10:33,120
the winner of best gamer moment of the year is,

4390
04:10:36,690 --> 04:10:39,780
this was huge.

4391
04:10:39,780 --> 04:10:43,100
44.6%.

4392
04:10:43,100 --> 04:10:46,059
Almost 45% of the vote.

4393
04:10:46,059 --> 04:10:48,659
The ultimate poker bluff versus Ludwig.

4394
04:10:49,500 --> 04:10:50,340
Wins.

4395
04:10:51,680 --> 04:10:53,280
Come on.

4396
04:10:53,280 --> 04:10:54,959
Took all his money.

4397
04:10:54,959 --> 04:10:55,840
He's here somewhere.

4398
04:10:55,840 --> 04:10:57,120
He's back there somewhere.

4399
04:10:57,120 --> 04:10:57,959
Sorry, Ludwig.

4400
04:10:59,100 --> 04:11:00,379
Beat you in poker.

4401
04:11:00,379 --> 04:11:01,979
It's my game.

4402
04:11:01,979 --> 04:11:03,180
And then after the first try,

4403
04:11:03,180 --> 04:11:07,959
Cuphead DLC boss at what, 14.8%?

4404
04:11:07,959 --> 04:11:09,879
That's not even close.

4405
04:11:09,879 --> 04:11:13,920
And then beating Ulcerated Tree Spirit early.

4406
04:11:13,920 --> 04:11:15,639
But that was, what's so impressive?

4407
04:11:15,639 --> 04:11:17,799
You beat the Tree Spirit, who cares?

4408
04:11:17,799 --> 04:11:20,000
That was like 30 levels too early.

4409
04:11:20,639 --> 04:11:22,399
I accidentally walked into that boss.

4410
04:11:22,399 --> 04:11:26,520
So that's pretty impressive, I think.

4411
04:11:26,520 --> 04:11:28,159
So there you go.

4412
04:11:28,159 --> 04:11:31,879
Weirdly enough, the mini golf course

4413
04:11:31,879 --> 04:11:33,719
was fourth or fifth place.

4414
04:11:33,719 --> 04:11:37,000
People thought the Ludwig bluff was way better.

4415
04:11:37,000 --> 04:11:42,370
And just like the good, there's also the bad.

4416
04:11:42,370 --> 04:11:44,250
I don't remember these nominees,

4417
04:11:44,250 --> 04:11:48,209
but they were way more than best.

4418
04:11:48,209 --> 04:11:50,049
I think they were, we had to narrow it down

4419
04:11:50,049 --> 04:11:50,889
because I think they were like,

4420
04:11:50,889 --> 04:11:52,209
oh wow, cool, Jeremy,

4421
04:11:52,209 --> 04:11:55,370
he got like seven nominees for best gamer moment

4422
04:11:55,370 --> 04:11:58,370
and 70 for worst gamer moment.

4423
04:11:58,370 --> 04:12:00,649
So we really had to narrow this down.

4424
04:12:00,649 --> 04:12:02,649
Honestly, I don't even know what's on this list.

4425
04:12:02,649 --> 04:12:03,889
I haven't seen it.

4426
04:12:03,889 --> 04:12:06,889
I just knew we did a few passes on it because we had to.

4427
04:12:07,889 --> 04:12:10,850
So here are your nominees for just like best gamer moment.

4428
04:12:10,850 --> 04:12:14,010
Here is the worst gamer moment of the entire year.

4429
04:12:14,010 --> 04:12:20,209
Worst gamer moment.

4430
04:12:20,209 --> 04:12:22,530
This is a nine minute category, by the way,

4431
04:12:22,530 --> 04:12:23,370
so strap in.

4432
04:12:23,370 --> 04:12:24,729
Hand fire tornado.

4433
04:12:24,729 --> 04:12:26,090
Jesus.

4434
04:12:26,090 --> 04:12:30,659
Give fire to the tornado.

4435
04:12:30,659 --> 04:12:33,540
Bro, there ain't no tornado on the screen.

4436
04:12:33,540 --> 04:12:38,520
Hand the fire to the tornado, but do it quietly.

4437
04:12:38,520 --> 04:12:41,350
Orc Minecraft fire.

4438
04:12:41,350 --> 04:12:45,829
Me, me build dirt house and burn it.

4439
04:12:45,829 --> 04:12:51,309
Is, you ten, if, none of these work.

4440
04:12:51,309 --> 04:12:55,920
F tens of, F tens of,

4441
04:12:55,920 --> 04:13:01,149
ecten, el tens, el, el ten.

4442
04:13:01,149 --> 04:13:03,629
What is this word, man?

4443
04:13:03,629 --> 04:13:06,469
What is this word?

4444
04:13:06,469 --> 04:13:08,590
Contestant number two.

4445
04:13:08,590 --> 04:13:12,430
Extensible, extensive background.

4446
04:13:16,239 --> 04:13:18,200
Shit, there's a flag right there.

4447
04:13:18,200 --> 04:13:19,319
What is it?

4448
04:13:19,319 --> 04:13:24,319
Oh my God, it's Switzerland.

4449
04:13:26,069 --> 04:13:26,909
What?

4450
04:13:28,190 --> 04:13:36,629
Excuse me.

4451
04:13:36,629 --> 04:13:40,440
Why is this thing coming alive?

4452
04:13:40,440 --> 04:13:44,590
Stone talus?

4453
04:13:44,590 --> 04:13:45,709
I'm fucking dead.

4454
04:14:00,709 --> 04:14:02,510
It's going to be a lot of damage.

4455
04:14:02,510 --> 04:14:03,350
Yeah, it's going to be a lot.

4456
04:14:03,350 --> 04:14:04,190
I mean, we can try.

4457
04:14:04,190 --> 04:14:05,950
It might as well, right?

4458
04:14:05,950 --> 04:14:12,959
Yeah, you can back out whenever it's looking rough.

4459
04:14:12,959 --> 04:14:13,799
We get fire down at this point.

4460
04:14:13,799 --> 04:14:15,120
Oh, fuck.

4461
04:14:15,120 --> 04:14:15,959
Ow.

4462
04:14:15,959 --> 04:14:17,120
I'm coming, I'm coming.

4463
04:14:17,120 --> 04:14:17,959
Don't let it reset.

4464
04:14:17,959 --> 04:14:18,799
Oh, what the fuck?

4465
04:14:18,799 --> 04:14:20,760
Oh shit, it killed me.

4466
04:14:20,760 --> 04:14:21,600
No.

4467
04:14:21,600 --> 04:14:22,920
It killed me too.

4468
04:14:22,920 --> 04:14:23,920
What the fuck?

4469
04:14:25,120 --> 04:14:26,559
What the hell?

4573
04:28:58,110 --> 04:29:05,229
about the Dark Souls from software tier lists and i'm gonna be honest i got halfway through

4574
04:29:05,229 --> 04:29:13,159
that list and internally wanted to stop but you can't it was like another three hours it was like

4575
04:29:13,159 --> 04:29:18,639
a four and a half hour stream i remember getting halfway through scrolling down and just going

4576
04:29:20,590 --> 04:29:26,510
there's like a hundred bosses i still haven't rated yet internally i wanted to turn the stream

4577
04:29:26,510 --> 04:29:34,860
off but i didn't i powered through and it was a mistake could have just played uh could have

4578
04:29:35,579 --> 04:29:43,950
crossed and people would have been happy ladies and gentlemen the winner of the worst stream of

4579
04:29:43,950 --> 04:30:11,100
the whole year it was close it was close with 27.6 percent of the vote number one and then 26.2

4580
04:30:11,100 --> 04:30:14,940
all these votes count by the way oh i'm not gonna vote because i don't think it counts

4581
04:30:15,899 --> 04:30:27,500
27.6 and one 26.2 and two number one it's the fortnight tournament i think i was alive for

4582
04:30:27,500 --> 04:30:35,239
four minutes and the stream was like three hours long and then baby sensory videos right behind it

4583
04:30:35,239 --> 04:30:42,329
at 26.2 that was a bad i thought that was so funny when we first talked about it uh dude what a fun

4584
04:30:42,409 --> 04:30:49,629
idea i'll do baby sensory videos i i don't know they're scary if you've seen one they're

4585
04:30:49,629 --> 04:30:59,680
terrifying it wasn't even funny it was just it was odd it's just odd you know okay those of you

4586
04:30:59,680 --> 04:31:05,200
streamers out there if you're watching you know when you get that moment when you're doing

4587
04:31:05,200 --> 04:31:12,159
something and you just go fuck this is bad and i don't know what to do i don't know how to get out

4588
04:31:12,159 --> 04:31:15,440
of this how do i get out of this how do i get out of this there has to be a way i can get out of

4589
04:31:15,440 --> 04:31:21,440
this and there isn't and you have to sleep in the bed that you made that was the baby sensory

4590

4765
04:57:36,349 --> 04:57:41,950
about and i'm telling you yeah but you know what else is as ridiculous as that yeah like we're

4766
04:57:41,950 --> 04:57:53,419
gonna get playing soon they're gonna be like i can fly eventually too so those are your nominees

4767
04:57:54,060 --> 04:57:59,419
for best stream or stream series of the year i feel like there are a lot of good ones i feel

4768
04:57:59,419 --> 04:58:05,880
like there was a lot of fun this year i say that every year but i do mean it and let's see i just

4769
04:58:05,880 --> 04:58:12,840
start crying on camera right i'm gonna start i'm gonna cry it's gonna happen just wait all right

4770
04:58:12,840 --> 04:58:19,720
ladies and gentlemen the what you have decided was the best stream or stream series of the year

4771
04:58:21,900 --> 04:58:29,659
oh the misery no uh elden ring at 27.2 percent and let me tell you it makes sense considering i

4772
04:58:29,659 --> 04:58:35,069
streamed that game for almost two straight months there was a high chance it was going

4773
04:58:35,069 --> 04:58:41,770
to be elden ring because it was a third of every stream i did this year and also game of the year

4774
04:58:41,770 --> 04:58:50,889
by the way uh elden ring at 27.2 underneath that is infomercial react andy gonna have to do more

4775
04:58:50,889 --> 04:58:57,610
of those react andy streams because uh okay and then breath i didn't even beat breath of the wild

4776
04:58:57,610 --> 04:59:03,439
yet but uh breath of wild number three by the way this is second most least skipped category

4777
04:59:04,159 --> 04:59:09,040
so people wanted to vote for this but elden ring obviously elden ring swept everything swept the

4778
04:59:09,040 --> 04:59:15,360
game awards swept my awards right so obviously it's gonna win and it was so fun those some of

4779
04:59:15,360 --> 04:59:22,840
the i honestly those some of the funnest streams i had i think ever on the channel that game just

4780
04:59:22,840 --> 04:59:31,599
had so many fun moments once in a generation you get it all right ladies and gentlemen it is time

4781
04:59:32,720 --> 04:59:38,080
we are approaching the final category which it's a small category but it's fun to do

4782
04:59:38,880 --> 04:59:45,840
the last category of the evening is best overall stream event there was only about four or five

4783
04:59:45,840 --> 04:59:53,919
this year um i love doing events i think they're fun get people together have a good time this is

4784
04:59:53,919 --> 05:00:00,159
an event can't vote for this though but hey maybe you can next year hey maybe jot it down for your

4785
05:00:00,159 --> 05:00:06,799
best event of the year the uh germa 95 uh holiday christmas stream but yeah this is gonna be it this

4786
05:00:06,799 --> 05:00:12,400
is the last category of the evening is what you thought the best stream of the year was that was

4787
05:00:12,400 --> 05:00:26,880
a event stream we did non-event here is event here are your nominees most least so what i've

4788
05:00:26,880 --> 05:00:34,970
decided to do is over the last few months we've scoured the country trying to find who i think

4789
05:00:35,849 --> 05:00:45,500
could potentially be able to replace me and a little bit of great and another one here

4790
05:00:47,419 --> 05:00:53,419
all right then we got a little might be a little too much pull back on the speed pull back

4791
05:00:54,139 --> 05:00:57,259
