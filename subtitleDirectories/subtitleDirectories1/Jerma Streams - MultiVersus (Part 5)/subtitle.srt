1
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:09,699
All right, I'm almost back. I just gotta get my controller, and we can get started. Give me one more sec.

2
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,929
Somebody just said Gremlin's 2 sucks, Jeremo.

3
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:20,280
Excuse me? You can't say that here. You can't say that here. That's a banned sentence. All right, let's keep going.

4
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,540
So again, thank you Warner Brothers for sponsoring this stream. Season one is underway for multiverses.

5
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:43,340
Morty is in the game, which we haven't seen yet. Gizmo's in the game. I'm excited! Mod that guy. Why would I mod that guy?

6
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:53,290
Oh my god. Wait, wait, wait, hold on. You need a live reaction. You need a live reaction.

7
00:01:53,530 --> 00:02:06,579
Come on. You gotta get a live reaction to this. I've been waiting like a hundred years for this.

8
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:37,030
It's Gizmo from Gremlins and Gremlins 2! No, this is really cool. That's not supposed to be that big.

9
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:48,180
So how does he play? Is he good? You guys have had access to this for like the last few hours. Is Gizmo good?

10
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:59,259
All right, hold on. We gotta go to the lab. Yeah, this is part of season one. Yeah, this is Morty.

11
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:07,189
I haven't even unlocked Morty. So I played this on Xbox. So I have two accounts.

12
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:16,389
Uh, is the timer going in the chat? Can you guys tell me? You gotta do the voice?

13
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:23,500
I'm not doing the voice. Should I even unlock Morty? I mean, I kind of, I should, right?

14
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,020
Okay, let's unlock. Let's get everybody unlocked and I want to take these people into the lab. There's cross progression.

15
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:38,250
I'm so glad you brought that up because you're absolutely right. There's cross progression across the whole platform.

16
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:56,229
So PC, Xbox, doesn't matter where you are. It's free. Do I even have the battle pass? What do I see there?

17
00:03:56,229 --> 00:04:06,900
Oh, hey, I think I do, don't I? What's this? ToonSquad96 unlock premium. Do I, I don't have the battle pass?

18
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:12,919
All right, I probably, I could probably just get it. Let's see what you get. So this is the premium battle pass.

19
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You know what my favorite thing about this game is?

20
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:22,870
This stuff. The ring out stuff. When you knock somebody out and you get to see like the cool animation,

21
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:28,899
I can't wait till there's a thousand of these. What do you get them for the very, at the very end?

22
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:38,410
Well, that's app, that's absolutely worth it. Okay. Well, I have to be grinding for that one.

23
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:49,910
I'm gonna spend some time playing. All right, let's go to the lab. I'm so happy to do this. No, get Taz out of here.

24
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:53,750
I don't want to play with Taz. Gizmo.

25
00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:11,560
Oh, okay. So he's not tiny. He's not tiny. I got an arrow. Okay. What's, what's, what's the standard combo?

26
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:20,790
That's seems pretty amazing. Is it just those three? Can I charge any of it? No.

27
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,069
They changed the hitbox apparently in this update.

28
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:33,019
You can travel really far. All right. So what about the standard? Pretty cool.

29
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,300
Just like from the goddamn movie.

30
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:42,230
I don't care. I'll spend all day playing to get better.

31
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,750
This is, this is a, this is definitely a moment where I'm going to play as hard as I can.

32
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,899
All right. So let me hold on.

33
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:54,120
So that's okay. That's that's the air too and it arcs.

34
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:57,240
Oh, yeah, that's fucking awesome. All right. So that's on cooldown now.

35
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
Oh my god, it's just like the movie.

36
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:06,649
All right, so what about down?

37
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:10,500
What?

38
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,939
Popcorn?

39
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:15,529
See, yeah, this is my bat chest moment guys. I'm sorry. It really is.

40
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:21,779
This is my, this is my bat chest moment. I get to have this. Um, what is it? What do they do? They linger?

41
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:32,310
That seems amazing.

42
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,230
All right, you can do popcorn.

43
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:38,339
Okay, cool. So what about the uh, what about specials?

44
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,420
He sings and dances. Okay, that's perfect. What does that do?

45
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:48,569
I think because he's a support, right?

46
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:52,759
Let's do all that stuff. That's crazy.

47
00:06:55,269 --> 00:06:57,339
He doesn't have a smash move.

48
00:06:57,339 --> 00:07:00,779
It doesn't look like a power. I guess that could be it, but it's not I don't think it has knockout power.

49
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:08,120
Find out. All right. So that's singing dance. We can look it up. You go into the box.

50
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,180
Ooh.

51
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,180
All right.

52
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,939
So that turns into that.

53
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:19,430
Is it defense?

54
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:24,019
Arrow popcorn.

55
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:26,819
Okay. Okay. All right. All right. Hold on.

56
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:30,420
Yeah.

57
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:35,079
Oh, I feel it.

58
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,079
So you really want to get that out there and just like

59
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:39,779
Don't die in the lab. That'll be embarrassing.

60
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:46,259
Okay, that's actually pretty cool.

61
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:48,259
Now, what about uh,

62
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,160
Up special is sort of just a little jump.

63
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,620
Which that seems kind of dangerous because it's not very far. All right.

64
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:01,899
Music is really loud.

65
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:08,329
All right. I'll turn it on. You can drive the little car.

66
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:13,740
Are you fucking kidding me?

67
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:26,310
Yeah, you can't swear. What?

68
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:29,829
No, i'm fine.

69
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:31,829
Jeremy, you are clamp.

70
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,870
Uh, there is a deep fake

71
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:45,690
With me as mr. Clamp if you've never seen it before it's actually pretty funny. That's better. Okay

72
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:49,929
So you really oh the umbrella. What is that?

73
00:08:50,570 --> 00:09:00,899
Okay, you can float around. All right. So down special was that I gotta let's do some reading

74
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:29,779
Oh, yeah

75
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:35,850
So I wonder what the what the singing does. All right, let's do some reading. Where is it?

76
00:09:35,929 --> 00:09:38,009
He you can read what can you move? Let's here we go. All right

77
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:47,320
Some of gizmos attacks apply a music buff affected enemies are silenced if they reach the max stack count

78
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,519
Stopping them from using cooldown abilities effect abilities will create a musical note

79
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:54,889
Rhythm allows the bard to play magical tunes

80
00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:02,200
When they evade hitting overlapping enemies, okay popcorn it can be ignited

81
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,590
We know that gizmo charges before slamming a keyboard dealing armor break. All right

82
00:10:08,299 --> 00:10:10,059
What's the what does it get in the box one?

83
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:16,549
This one here gizmo hops on a toy chest which blocks projectiles hold input to stay in the chest

84
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:21,700
While attached to an ally he will hold out an umbrella for a similar effect on his ally. All right

85
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:35,940
All right, let's fucking go. I'm ready. Let's give it a try who wants to queue up and get your ass kicked

86
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:45,299
Here comes the heat

87
00:10:45,299 --> 00:11:01,480
Oh, right. That was lebron. You're a bozo. You should play as morty

88
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:03,559
I don't I don't know really how to play as morty

89
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:15,190
This is gizmo only for a little while just for a little while when it's stripe

90
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:25,179
Yeah, apparently stripes gonna be in the game too. All right, I don't have the skin. Oh, well, that's fine

91
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:34,340
You have to do the gizmo voice while you play. Okay, hold on. There's a way to do it

92
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,340
It's still kind of like this, right?

93
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:47,080
I'll get in here. I don't have any perks

94
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,399
All right, let's see if I can do this one v one with gizmos probably bad idea

95
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:58,649
But whatever i'm gonna get beat up for a little while show them what we got. That's that's stitch

96
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:04,730
Don't they that they have

97
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:10,919
That's auto gizmo is supposed to be support. He seems like really actually pretty fun to play

98
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:17,559
As a solo character too. All right, let's go. I've been waiting 20. Oh, and I gotta tweet. I have to tweet this

99
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:19,879
I'll tweet it after i'll tweet it

100
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:43,320
Oh, don't touch those musical notes

101
00:12:51,129 --> 00:13:09,820
You can shoot it up that combo get there. I get the combo get the combo going

102
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:18,259
just

103
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:23,340
Run over the car

104
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,019
Whoa, that was a good combo

105
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:41,700
I gotta charge that more often

106
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:05,740
Oh

107
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:17,769
one for blue

108
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,370
That stomp is awesome, too. This one here

109
00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:26,009
Has a lot of priority. It feels like

110
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:40,860
All right. That's good. Good warm-up. That's good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. I told you we got where's my phone

111
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,820
I gotta tweet. I forgot to tweet

112
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,220
He's fun to play

113
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,750
play again

114
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:58,840
Yes

115
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,000
Oh this is I forgot. This is what the the tweet I was gonna do was. Oh, that's fine. Yeah, that's fine

116
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,539
Is that a good one? I said I said I was gonna be crying

117
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:12,330
I can't oh, no, I did that joke. It's fine

118
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,330
All right. I gotta get used to the move set

119
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:28,919
Wait, no, I just tweeted. Hold on. I mean look at him

120
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,440
Oh

121
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:48,730
He's so it's he's perfect. He's he's actually perfect. It's one of my actually favorite movies ever

122
00:15:49,210 --> 00:16:01,690
It's just i'm so happy to see him in the game

123
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,620
For the longest time I never thought they were ever doing anything with gremlins ever again

124
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:26,809
They're making a third movie. I don't know what they're doing. They're doing aren't they doing like an animated thing?

125
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:36,580
Uh-oh versus a bugs. It's my old best friend

126
00:16:38,659 --> 00:16:56,220
I better be uh, be careful. Why are you so weird? I don't know blame this movie. I wish that was a joke

127
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:13,289
All right, so it's down the down special is the really only knockout potential that he has

128
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,380
No, no, no, no, no. No. Oh, he doesn't know he doesn't know he doesn't know

129
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:55,859
I screwed that up. Sorry. Oh I can drive that car

130
00:17:56,579 --> 00:18:22,299
What are you doing? Give me that sandwich

131
00:18:46,740 --> 00:19:08,650
I just looked over and saw that it's not you're fucking with me now

132
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,220
So how did the hitboxes change?

133
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:45,720
Excuse me

134
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:58,250
You don't like the camera. Why not? I told you we got this

135
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:03,319
What's my favorite type of pizza?

136
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:05,319
standard pepperoni thin crust

137
00:20:11,859 --> 00:20:13,859
And it's gotta be crunchy it's gonna be crispy on the bottom

138
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:17,700
I wanted to be crispy and crunchy on the bottom and it better be where i'm gonna be

139
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,500
What's happening?

140
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:31,880
Wait, what's going on? So look there the hitbox is different. So it's now tied to their actual animations

141
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:41,440
Before it was kind of a little square or oval around them. The hitboxes I think have shrunk a little

142
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,160
Interesting. All right. Is that a better is that a good thing or a bad thing? It seems I can't really notice

143
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:50,150
Feels pretty good so far

144
00:20:50,150 --> 00:21:00,359
I think it's pretty good

145
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:03,259
I had a dream that you went to my university graduation

146
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,279
And drank my grandmother's ashes in a milkshake before I was meant to go on stage. It was awkward

147
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:20,869
Stop fucking eating after midnight. You know what happens? Come on. Show them what we got

148
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:33,799
What what I was in the stands I was in the audience. Where did I get it? Why would I have that?

149
00:21:51,059 --> 00:22:01,799
Wrong way. I'm used to the way that bugs plays. I gotta get used to uh gizmo. I love it though. He's great

150
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:30,230
Hmm, that's okay. You got to feel that up way earlier. It's a great move though

151
00:22:41,269 --> 00:23:47,200
All right, come on one for blue does the singing hurt anybody I feel like it doesn't oops

152
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,480
We're good. We're good. We're good

153
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:57,359
I told you we got this

154
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,519
Why is the gremlin so big? Well

155
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,640
How can we play like you're orchestrating a band because I move around a lot

156
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:11,519
You look like you you'd like to suck lemons

157
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,319
Wait, who are you? Why what are you doing here? Why are you being so mean to me?

158
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:25,960
Here comes the heat. Let me go. Let me go read something. Hold on. Should I try morty?

159
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:36,150
Oh a few more games with gizmo if I play with morty, um

160
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:38,480
Should I do the voice?

161
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:47,319
All right. I want to read this because i'm trying to find an opportunity at least in solo to do that. Oh

162
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,099
Can't read it here comes the heat

163
00:24:54,819 --> 00:24:56,900
This camera angle if you were here in the beginning of the stream

164
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:07,559
Uh, oh, all right, definitely want that and that's good just to have

165
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:17,079
I'll do some teams to it because I think you can shoot the arrow at a teammate

166
00:25:17,640 --> 00:26:03,160
Show them what we got

167
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,160
Oh, I keep forgetting about the car

168
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:20,920
Get out of there

169
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,539
Get out of the car. Stop it

170
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:24,420
stop

171
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:36,470
Where's my car?

172
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,349
Yeah

173
00:26:37,349 --> 00:26:56,049
Get away from me. You want where you want to go for it?

174
00:26:57,079 --> 00:27:01,000
No, no, no. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, wait, wait, wait, get your car. Oh, you want to go for it?

175
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:19,329
Hey, I want whatever

176
00:27:19,329 --> 00:27:32,640
No, don't shoot me don't

177
00:27:49,200 --> 00:28:04,039
One for blue

178
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:36,359
Get out of that car

179
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:41,509
I'm off to read a 3 000 word essay, but how much I don't like you

180
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:52,240
Don't

181
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:58,900
Do you see how happy i've been with this gizmo is in the game, man

182
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:06,160
Here comes the heat you're doing cvd water. Oh my goodness. I forgot. This was there the whole round

183
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:14,920
That's so stupid cvd water in your eyes

184
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,640
The point is to get gizmo leveled up as fast as possible to get his ultimate perk

185
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,829
Show him what we got

186
00:29:41,829 --> 00:29:45,250
Wait, that looks wrong

187
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,250
Yeah, the reason why I changed the angle of the camera is because

188
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:54,359
It used to shake because the monitor that it was sitting on would always move whenever I moved it was really annoying

189
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,339
It looks fucked up

190
00:29:58,339 --> 00:30:00,339
Well, i'll fix it next time

191
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:47,480
What the hell just happened? That was weird

192
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:57,599
Good combo good combo

193
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:39,299
Water in my eyes one for blue. I need my arrows

194
00:31:40,019 --> 00:32:06,000
That's a good. That's a good finisher. That's a good finisher. We got this

195
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:16,119
That butt slam is amazing if you can get it continue

196
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,630
That was a good game though

197
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:24,309
Do a different face cam. Oh, I can do this right fine. I'll do the funny thing for everybody

198
00:32:36,819 --> 00:32:41,140
It really does look like someone's coming out of that door piano wire

199
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:46,839
They're gonna come out of that door with piano wire and i'm gonna get hit manned on stream. That's what that is

200
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,920
Yeah, I wonder what's gonna happen in that door

201
00:32:55,890 --> 00:33:15,799
It's a full monster costume persons coming out of there. Here comes the heat

202
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,119
Something looks so strange about that too. It looks wrong

203
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:57,299
Monsters ink door. Oh morty. What does morty do? That's a lie. I know what morty does make it bigger

204
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:04,289
Show them what we got what a png of an iphone around the camera

205
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:30,159
Why all right first, let me just uh, let me do some are we are we playing or what are you what are you up to?

206
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,320
Wait, what are you what are you up to? All right, we're playing. All right, let's go

207
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:55,599
All right, let's get a vacuum cleaner he how did you dodge the car? All right, I gotta be quiet

208
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,360
I gotta be shut up

209
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,159
I wasn't in the game. I was too busy thinking about the fucking face cam

210
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:13,889
I'm sloppy

211
00:36:13,889 --> 00:36:40,769
What is that?

212
00:36:40,769 --> 00:36:42,929
200 almost what the hell?

213
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,920
40 I mean, come on morty

214
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:28,960
Oh

215
00:38:36,869 --> 00:38:41,750
Oh, what a fucking match oh what a match oh that was close

216
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,440
Oh, I thought I had it on those down. Uh, damn it on the left side

217
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:51,030
Oh, that's close

218
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:59,039
Uh, yeah, sure. Okay

219
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:06,849
All right, i'm back here comes the heat

220
00:39:07,329 --> 00:39:13,639
Morty's got a lot of projectiles, huh?

221
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:24,159
Okay, that's better. That was so close to I do you see on the left side?

222
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:30,710
I did the down boom boom. He recovered down boom boom recovered again. I just couldn't follow up. That's a good match though. It's like

223
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:34,900
His most fun

224
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:48,449
Who's my favorite gremlin?

225
00:39:48,449 --> 00:39:52,320
Uh, that would be I think the name of the gremlin is actually daffy

226
00:39:54,690 --> 00:40:05,039
Daffy was my favorite gremlin morty is a mage more of a mage than a bruiser

227
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:11,400
um

228
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,480
No, not daffy duck. All right. Hold on. I gotta be quiet. I gotta be gamer uh gamer time

229
00:40:16,119 --> 00:41:06,199
wrong way

230
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:29,800
Oh

231
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,800
That's all right. Sorry ready three two one

232
00:42:11,969 --> 00:42:13,969
What the fuck I teleported

233
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,440
No, why do I keep facing the wrong way new controller?

234
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:52,239
Sounds like a chicken. I thought that was a chicken sound

235
00:42:52,960 --> 00:43:33,489
Went right over his head

236
00:43:33,489 --> 00:43:56,599
Come on that fucking launch power

237
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:12,469
Close good one. Good one. Good fight. Good fight. Good fight. That was a close one

238
00:44:14,369 --> 00:44:17,329
Continue. I mean we kind of have to do it. There's a best out of three here

239
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:26,710
We gotta do it again. Hold on. Wait, we have to follow up

240
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:31,079
No, no, no, like you were shaking my grandmother's ashes in a protein shake

241
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:37,480
When the dean called out my name and was meant to shake my hand you ran past me and drank the frothy milkshake

242
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:51,059
What's wrong with you? Wait, did I miss the opportunity? Oh shit. That's all right. Let's stick with the tie

243
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,940
I thought I hit rematch didn't I I guess I didn't here comes the heat

244
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:05,010
All right. Let's do some

245
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:07,650
Let's do some team stuff. I want to check the uh, the gizmo team stuff

246
00:45:12,389 --> 00:45:13,829
teams and

247
00:45:13,829 --> 00:45:18,739
free-for-all maybe here comes the heat

248
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:25,940
Because i'm curious. I think you can shoot the arrow at your teammate. Oh, they didn't rematch. Oh, it's all right

249
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:33,730
Go to the end of the options and increase the dead zone on your controller

250
00:45:36,679 --> 00:45:47,280
Yeah, how do I do that? Oh wait horizontal dead zone. What what so?

251
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,159
Yeah, I keep not wanting to be facing that direction

252
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:59,170
What should I put this at?

253
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:12,039
Higher or lower 40 percent. What vertical should these both be the same?

254
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:21,489
You should lower it if you feel like you're not getting an input red

255
00:46:21,969 --> 00:46:23,809
It's mainly when I hit left

256
00:46:23,809 --> 00:46:30,900
So I try to turn and then by the time I turn left and want to let go to do the neutral, uh arrow move

257
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:36,869
He's still facing right

258
00:46:36,869 --> 00:46:39,750
Do you know if we're gonna get the sexy gremlin as a skin? I have no idea

259
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:46,239
So it should be higher or lower then make it smaller then i'll try 20

260
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:59,590
See if 20 does it

261
00:47:01,909 --> 00:47:09,650
Use the second stick for reverse moves. Um, not with gizmo because gizmo is standard

262
00:47:10,289 --> 00:47:15,599
Um, just standard attack is the bow so I can't use right stick to aim it

263
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:22,440
It has to be standard attack two gizmos. This is gonna be interesting. All right, let's go. Let's do it

264
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,260
Show them what we got. How come you're not eating any carrots because i'm not playing as bugs

265
00:47:38,739 --> 00:47:45,599
Hey bugs is old news to me right now second daffy gets put into the game. You know it

266
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:54,050
All right. Let's see if we can do this with two gizmos

267
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,780
Just get in the car

268
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:15,889
I think they nerfed jake a lot too, by the way

269
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:19,170
From what I saw on the patch notes. He got pretty much every move got nerfed

270
00:48:19,889 --> 00:48:23,599
We can drive each other's cars. I think too

271
00:48:36,849 --> 00:48:59,170
Oh

272
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:13,889
Oh, I thought you're gonna jump oh I could get a double here so cleanly if I could just do it

273
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:26,119
Oh

274
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:29,400
That does not have priority anymore. Does it that was was that part of the nerve?

275
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:41,380
Shit, all right, we gotta get this jake out of here

276
00:50:01,429 --> 00:50:02,949
Oh shit

277
00:50:02,949 --> 00:50:08,000
We gotta get rid of this jake

278
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:32,099
That was huge

279
00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:34,099
Nah, that dead zone. I gotta change it

280
00:50:51,639 --> 00:50:56,369
Stop that's it

281
00:50:57,170 --> 00:51:15,750
Big point for red

282
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:21,030
Yeah, we just can't launch anybody shake it off. We only getting stuck. We just could not get that uh,

283
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:22,869
Darn it out of here

284
00:51:22,869 --> 00:51:32,719
play again

285
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:35,960
Let's go

286
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,679
Your dead zone dead zone should be higher 40 to 60

287
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:43,639
Yeah, I always have the problem where i'm trying to turn the other way and then do the standard

288
00:51:44,119 --> 00:51:49,539
Attack move and I just am not turning try it. Uh, let me try that is it like 60

289
00:51:50,019 --> 00:51:55,519
That's cool that you can actually do this in the game though

290
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:03,679
So it needs to be like higher you're saying like that if you're not turning lower the dead zone

291
00:52:04,469 --> 00:52:06,469
Do 60 30 try 60 30

292
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:11,349
Try it

293
00:52:11,349 --> 00:52:17,409
Oh my god. I want it. Let's get to work

294
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,960
Then you wipe decrease it. Okay

295
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:29,079
Lebron is bugged really

296
00:52:36,519 --> 00:52:46,369
I want it. Show them what we got. Are you a fan of american edm?

297
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:49,519
I don't really listen to that much music. So

298
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,239
I mean, I like a lot of stuff, but I don't really listen to a lot

299
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:08,869
Hey, my sister just ate the last swiss roll. Wait, wait, you you have the stream muted. You can't even hear me

300
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:47,889
Oh, that was lagging

301
00:53:47,889 --> 00:53:49,889
Getting my ass kicked here

302
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:11,480
What? Holy shit, I went flying

303
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:41,320
People weird teleporting around oh my god get down there

304
00:54:43,000 --> 00:55:00,800
You know, my biggest problem with teams is I just it's hard. I don't know who to pay attention

305
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:04,480
I don't know who paid to pay. You know what i'm saying porky fucking pig will be in the game at some point

306
00:55:17,159 --> 00:55:25,030
This is unacceptable

307
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,840
Big point for red

308
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:49,829
My ball

309
00:55:49,829 --> 00:56:09,920
Holy shit. Oh shit. Shake it up. We're only getting started

310
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,440
He's on mcdonald's wi-fi. No, mom

311
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:25,199
Yeah, I did. I want to do more one v ones. Here comes the heat

312
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:39,840
That's where that's where I i've shined here comes the heat. We demand gizmo. I'll do okay. Let's let's go back to gizmo

313
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:50,280
The team-based stuff is so is awesome in this game. It's just I I need to know what when to do what that's my problem

314
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:55,239
Everybody has these awesome

315
00:56:55,239 --> 00:57:00,579
Kind of co-op moves just trying to be like oh do I should do it now?

316
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:09,750
Comes with game knowledge

317

We both went like this

326
01:00:17,079 --> 01:00:20,789
And then I just freaked out and died

327
01:00:20,949 --> 01:00:22,150
Okay

01:02:38,610 --> 01:02:40,610
I traded places with him

338
01:02:42,469 --> 01:02:59,400
That was so good

339
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,559
Oh now i'm gonna get fucking diarrhea on

340
01:03:34,719 --> 01:03:42,980
One for blue

341
01:03:43,460 --> 01:04:05,719
Give me the car

342
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:27,809

01:04:27,809 --> 01:04:31,090
Oh, come on shake it up. We're only getting started

344
01:04:33,349 --> 01:04:37,269
I completely forgot that the arrows had cooled down and then I freaked out and then I just stopped playing

345
01:04:37,989 --> 01:04:45,940
See dude, just gotta keep punching till there's no one left to punch. Here comes the heat

346
01:04:50,239 --> 01:05:00,500
That was important this has all been warm up until now this has all been warm up until right now

347
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:14,659
Can you please read a book on stream? Which one?

348
01:05:15,139 --> 01:05:18,849
You have a favorite book show them what we got

349
01:05:19,489 --> 01:05:29,809
Somebody said will they take the sponsorship away if you keep losing no, that's not how it works

350
01:05:34,019 --> 01:05:36,019
Hey, I am way above 500 right now

351
01:05:36,579 --> 01:05:39,480
I've only lost like three times. I'm not losing this one

352
01:06:59,349 --> 01:08:08,760
You dodged that one that didn't hit all right. All right. All right

353
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:51,810
I have no idea what happened there. I think lagged out maybe

354
01:09:03,029 --> 01:09:13,670
Wait, you're cheating I didn't do anything. Okay, um the season pass

355
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:16,470
I should feel like I should have it. I feel like I should just get it

356
01:09:26,819 --> 01:09:33,590
Can you do a sleep stream now? Here comes the heat. Is there any hold on?

357
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:45,109
Ismo's air down special can bounce off his popcorn and his toy car

358
01:09:45,909 --> 01:09:52,579
To detonate them instantly. Wait, what? So that's the butt drop

359
01:09:55,409 --> 01:09:58,369
So I can butt drop my car and blow them up. That's pretty cool

360
01:09:59,539 --> 01:10:00,579
Okay

361
01:10:00,579 --> 01:10:08,710
So you can be attached to someone

362
01:10:12,579 --> 01:10:15,939
I haven't been using the music at all. I don't even know what it does

363
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:33,270
I've just been kind of just trying to get people. I want that cool. What about um, is there any gremlins?

364
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:54,399
Uh, uh, where is it? Yeah, are there any new gremlins ring outs or anything cannonball? Cool

365
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:21,720
Bossamer cool green lantern. Is there any gremlin stuff? No. All right. No gremlin ring outs

366
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:31,989
What about banners? I think the only one is the gizmo one, right? Please read that popcorn book

367
01:11:32,229 --> 01:11:41,960
I want the gizmo one. All right, what about announcer? Is there a gizmo announcer?

368
01:11:46,789 --> 01:11:51,810
Do I have enough to buy this?

369
01:11:51,810 --> 01:12:01,279
Oh, I can get it. All right. I got the skin. Nice

370
01:12:11,239 --> 01:12:14,880
I'll do another team fight and we're gonna do team fight. Who got the most changes?

371
01:12:20,119 --> 01:12:37,880
It looks like bugs got changed a lot too. This patch is as of what today yesterday, dude. This guy brought combat gear

372
01:12:38,119 --> 01:12:47,319
Yeah, trying i'm trying a little too hard here. You should read moby dick. I'm studying it

373
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:58,119
Would you guys actually watch a moby dick stream? I feel like people wouldn't isn't it long though

374
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:00,689
I don't really want to read that

375
01:13:47,909 --> 01:13:53,029
Oh didn't hit

376
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,800
That's not gizmo talking. That was weird

377
01:14:17,159 --> 01:14:27,920
Oh

378
01:14:27,920 --> 01:15:03,270
Whoops wrong way

379
01:15:03,270 --> 01:15:05,270
Oh, you got me with it. Nice shot

380
01:15:31,109 --> 01:15:33,350
Oh his car had better priority than my car

381
01:15:42,850 --> 01:15:45,600
What do you mean for halloween gizmo

382
01:15:56,710 --> 01:15:58,500
That's a good bench

383
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:06,130
I I almost got caught like three or four times that could have gone either way

384
01:16:08,289 --> 01:16:18,579
I keep getting cut off. Oh, it's because i'm an idiot you guys want to see anybody

385
01:16:18,739 --> 01:16:20,739
Didn't superman get a bunch of changes too?

386
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:44,239
Side profile andy. All right. I'm gonna move you from there to here. I gotta find a way to get you over there though

387
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:47,960
I just did

388
01:16:47,960 --> 01:17:04,819
You're not shaking anymore, which is so much better the announcer. I got a different announcer. It has

389
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:46,880
Oh

390
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:49,720
Brat

391
01:17:49,720 --> 01:18:10,800
We're just playing bumper cars at this point. Why is the car still here?

392
01:18:51,409 --> 01:19:09,779
Oh charged good fight good fight

393
01:19:14,069 --> 01:19:16,720
Gizmo is so fun

394
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:23,000
Gizmo is so fun

395
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:36,180
Not too complicated either. Just really really clean move set. I love it. Oh, I'm most of that. Okay. I want to get to that car

396
01:19:38,979 --> 01:19:40,260
Come on

397
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:50,079
Character they added austin powers with the would you play with him for a whole stream? Yeah

398
01:19:50,640 --> 01:20:01,039
I'm gonna buy a new announcer. I'll get a new announcer. I don't think I have enough currency left though

399
01:20:14,279 --> 01:20:16,960
You're gonna play 20 minutes till dawn

400
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:30,720
I actually really do want to return to that that game was a blast. All right, let's go

401
01:20:30,960 --> 01:21:21,590
I've been on a pretty good streak here

402
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:23,590
Holy shit, we couldn't even hit each other

403
01:21:23,590 --> 01:21:26,340
That was that was kind of wild actually

404
01:21:26,659 --> 01:21:55,909
This is gonna be interesting. Okay

405
01:22:46,520 --> 01:23:17,489
Whoa

406
01:23:17,649 --> 01:23:35,159
That's gonna be close no our cars

407
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:14,819
That was close good game damn, let's go again, okay, is the announcer the announcer's tabs

408
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:22,550
Pick character. Yeah, I wonder how many uh, how many

409
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:27,779
People are not believing. What's the record this dream? It's got to be

410
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,760
It's got to be at least

411
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:42,850
70 win streak or win rate, right? Although I might hit gamer fatigue at some point here soon. I'm not sure

412
01:24:43,569 --> 01:24:50,479
It could happen at any moment. I just don't know when I can check. Oh, okay. I'll do it after this

413
01:24:54,760 --> 01:25:11,270
start time

414
01:25:11,510 --> 01:25:14,689
New gamer award. All right, let's go bro

415
01:25:41,779 --> 01:25:43,300
Oh nice

416
01:25:44,199 --> 01:26:16,899
Okay. All right

417
01:26:35,090 --> 01:26:37,090
Shit

418
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:57,880
Oh got tripped up on the left side that was close that was close

419
01:28:04,659 --> 01:28:07,060
That was really really. Oh, that's unfortunate

420
01:28:11,140 --> 01:28:14,979
I was trying to I I don't know if when he looked over and he saw the car

421
01:28:15,699 --> 01:28:17,699
Because I was trying to drop the car on him

422
01:28:17,939 --> 01:28:22,239
Because when he was recovering the car was gonna hit him right in the head and just take him out

423
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:24,640
Maybe he tried to avoid the car and I don't know

424
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:37,729
What's up with the land tournament camera angle?

425
01:28:41,279 --> 01:28:44,640
No, that's not accurate it would be right in front of me and down

426
01:28:45,810 --> 01:28:54,819
No, it would be up here and facing down right in front of the monitor in the center. This is podcaster angle. Yeah

427
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:13,909
The mic in frame is a choice. No, it's not I got nowhere else to put it

428
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:20,579
If I put it down, you won't be able to hear me. Everyone will call me audio andy. All right, let me read this

429
01:29:23,270 --> 01:29:29,619
So I can down special on the popcorn and the cars to blow them up. That's pretty like pretty cool

430
01:29:40,359 --> 01:29:43,760
Mike shouldn't be that far from your mouth. Wait, what?

431
01:29:44,319 --> 01:29:46,319
Here's the thing if it's here

432
01:29:46,949 --> 01:29:51,090
Then I I can't see the screen this sucks

433
01:29:52,229 --> 01:29:54,229
All right, i'll try one match like this

434
01:29:54,689 --> 01:30:00,399
And you can't see my face

435
01:30:00,399 --> 01:30:19,239
No, I can't see the screen. What the hell is that?

436
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:22,500
What's that? That was crazy. I don't know what he's doing

437
01:30:22,899 --> 01:30:50,239
What is he doing? I I can do that. Can I do that move?

438
01:30:51,039 --> 01:31:36,279
Oh, we both did it

439
01:31:38,119 --> 01:31:46,439
All right, let's go let's go come on

440
01:31:46,680 --> 01:32:44,079
All right. Oh, I got saved

441
01:32:50,229 --> 01:33:11,750
Sorry. All right. Let's make it happen. Let's make it happen. Geez. I almost came back

442
01:33:13,189 --> 01:33:15,189
Winner winner winner

443
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:16,789
nice fight

444
01:33:16,789 --> 01:33:25,300
You're playing like a fighter pilot

445
01:33:25,859 --> 01:33:32,979
I move man. I gotta I have to move around. I think this chair is electricity is surging through this chair

446
01:33:33,939 --> 01:33:35,939
Come on pick character

447
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:46,100
All right, how about hmm should I change character and just get absolutely decimated like that's a bad idea

448
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:49,619
I feel like I got the rhythm with gizmo right now

449
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:57,159
It'll do gizmo for another one mattress. Oh, and then i'll play some morty. I gotta see what the hell he does

450
01:34:01,010 --> 01:34:03,510
interesting

451
01:34:03,510 --> 01:34:05,510
Iron giant versus gizmo

452
01:34:05,670 --> 01:34:10,130
I feel like i'm gonna get pretty destroyed here

453
01:34:17,079 --> 01:34:19,079
start time

454
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:24,050
Your title would be lying. I don't know if it'd be lying

455
01:34:24,770 --> 01:34:30,050
I

456
01:34:30,050 --> 01:34:37,590
Alright, let's see what I can do. Are we in is this the scooby-doo level? Oh, this is gonna be bad. I lose

457
01:34:38,390 --> 01:34:40,390
I don't think it's possible. I can win this

458
01:34:40,390 --> 01:34:51,590
Although he's kind of huge though

459
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:27,670
Oh jesus

460
01:35:27,670 --> 01:35:29,670
What the heck?

461
01:35:50,020 --> 01:35:52,100

Oh, i'm in trouble

464
01:36:27,189 --> 01:36:29,189
I knew this was gonna be a major problem

465
01:36:36,069 --> 01:36:38,069
What the fuck to die?

466
01:36:44,609 --> 01:36:46,609
I'm too small to get rid of them

467
01:36:46,689 --> 01:36:55,590
Okay

468
01:36:55,590 --> 01:36:59,029
I gotta go for I gotta go for something weird here. All right, i'm gonna go with something weird see if I can do it

469
01:36:59,670 --> 01:37:13,800
He's too big

470
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:19,859
All right, if you stick with iron giant then i'm gonna have to go superman

471
01:37:25,479 --> 01:37:27,479
Come on

472
01:37:28,279 --> 01:37:31,489
I don't have superman

473
01:37:31,489 --> 01:37:39,460
What didn't I have didn't I unlock superman? He's level seven. Oh, he was free rotation

474
01:37:49,079 --> 01:37:51,079
All right, I gotta remember how to play with superman

475
01:37:57,359 --> 01:37:59,350
Change the announcer

476
01:37:59,350 --> 01:38:09,649
I don't have any other announcers

477
01:38:09,649 --> 01:38:13,569
I have lebron taz and then the default right? I don't think I have anybody else

478
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:33,939
Change it back to lebron

479
01:38:36,609 --> 01:38:38,609
All right, let's make this happen

480
01:38:38,609 --> 01:39:28,640
I threw him up

481
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:07,300
Let's go i'm done with this

482
01:40:08,659 --> 01:40:11,350
Steel

483
01:41:02,289 --> 01:41:31,810
Are you kidding me what what the fuck

484
01:41:35,729 --> 01:42:02,180
You just can't watch him so he just says you suck

485
01:42:07,729 --> 01:42:33,250
I'm, no i'm not naked your mic cuts. It's because I scream too much and my audio sucks. I keep forgetting to do the um announcer

486
01:42:43,949 --> 01:42:46,369
professional andy about professional andy I

487
01:42:47,890 --> 01:42:51,250
We're gonna we're gonna see just how good and it does feel weird looking all though

488
01:42:51,250 --> 01:43:42,819
You have no idea how far away you are. It's strange. All right, let's go. Let's go. What the hell I pressed buttons and it didn't happen

489
01:43:43,460 --> 01:43:47,810
Hey, dude, did you see that stun?

490
01:44:50,180 --> 01:44:55,239
Oh nice

491
01:44:55,239 --> 01:45:21,800
Ooh

492
01:47:28,850 --> 01:47:32,050
You look like you eat pizza with a fork who cares eat food the way you like to eat food

493
01:47:32,130 --> 01:47:35,090
Why do you have to judge people for the way they eat their pizza?

494
01:47:47,109 --> 01:47:49,109
Eat it cross-side first

495
01:47:49,109 --> 01:47:56,850
Like here, all right, that was I think that's a good gizmo one to go out on let's uh, let's try morty i'll try morty

496
01:48:02,579 --> 01:48:10,020
Oh now sir. Oh my god. I keep forgetting. I'm sorry. I have no idea what morty does. So let's just kind of get beat here

497
01:48:10,659 --> 01:48:16,840
This is kind of free points

498
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:18,359
I'm very honest

499
01:48:18,359 --> 01:48:36,819
Do the voice just wait till I fall off the screen accidentally. You'll hear it

500
01:48:47,619 --> 01:48:54,920
These moves do but they're cool. It's it really does sound like a chicken or a turkey

501
01:49:05,670 --> 01:49:19,680
Oh look at me

502
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:21,760
I like that line, too

503
01:49:50,899 --> 01:50:13,000
He's kind of cracked if i'm honest this he's kind of ridiculous what the heck

504
01:50:52,869 --> 01:50:54,869
All right, i'm not gonna get lost come on

505
01:51:14,930 --> 01:51:16,930
Oh, I didn't know what the moves were

506
01:51:18,420 --> 01:51:20,420
He's kind of cracked. I just don't know what he does

507
01:51:25,329 --> 01:51:30,289
Oh jeez was this match more than you bargained for rematch, okay

508
01:51:31,329 --> 01:51:37,350
You just do another you laugh you lose

509
01:51:38,390 --> 01:51:40,390
We can set it up

510
01:51:41,029 --> 01:51:43,029
Uh, let's go back to the trident true

511
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:59,760
See if I still got it

512
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:05,859
I could have had that if I uh, if I tried to really pull that together. I probably could have had it start time

513
01:52:09,270 --> 01:52:11,270
They nerfed bugs. They well they did

514
01:52:12,739 --> 01:52:15,060
He was really good though bugs was amazing

515
01:52:17,380 --> 01:52:20,840
So makes sense

516
01:53:05,279 --> 01:54:12,210
Really almost had it. Oh, yeah. All right

517
01:54:25,239 --> 01:54:32,850
Check this out

518
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:37,800
Where is it? Where is it?

519
01:54:42,199 --> 01:54:55,109
There it is

520
01:54:55,189 --> 01:55:02,420
Damn, damn

521
01:55:17,840 --> 01:55:19,840
Jesus

522
01:55:23,640 --> 01:55:38,979
So

523
01:55:58,420 --> 01:56:00,420
I'm gonna try to finish that up. I was too scared

524
01:56:19,029 --> 01:56:21,029
Gamer fatigue sets in

525
01:57:19,670 --> 01:57:32,880
Oh, I could feel the fatigue fit, uh, just fitting onto me I didn't land

526
01:57:33,359 --> 01:57:37,729
I think I only needed one of the bat move. They really did nerf that, huh?

527
01:57:38,289 --> 01:57:40,449
That was a good match though

528
01:57:46,659 --> 01:57:54,210
So the bat move has less, uh hit frames right stop drinking ethanol

529
01:57:56,520 --> 01:57:58,520
I don't I don't do that

530
01:57:58,760 --> 01:58:05,640
Spreading rumors. All right. I will change the announcer. I promise

531
01:58:12,289 --> 01:58:16,960
Okay, i've got default announcer lebron has

532
01:58:23,539 --> 01:58:30,739
I don't have enough coins a character choose a character who are you gonna send in who you're gonna play as

533
01:58:35,170 --> 01:58:37,170
You must select your combatant

534
01:58:39,670 --> 01:58:43,189
Oh, man, who are you gonna choose choose your fighter

535
01:58:44,069 --> 01:58:47,829
Take your fighter pal. What are you gonna put in the ring?

536
01:58:49,220 --> 01:58:52,979
Zoinks a lot of fighters to choose from man. That's definitely the best one

537
01:58:54,760 --> 01:58:56,760
Choose your character

538
01:59:03,170 --> 01:59:07,090
All right time to select your character. I was not ready for the laugh at the end of that

539
01:59:09,560 --> 01:59:14,149
A lot of fighters to choose from man. Ah, it's jaggy. I don't have any coins

540
01:59:15,460 --> 01:59:31,250
Do I get do I get whoa, hold on a second 250 gold. Hold on a second. Excuse me

541
01:59:34,710 --> 01:59:36,710
All right, 70 win rate. That's pretty good

542
01:59:37,350 --> 01:59:55,680
I'll take 70 percent. I have a premium token. Oh dude. I have one. I have one

543
01:59:56,640 --> 02:00:08,609
Oh shit. All right. That means I get all the stuff. Oh I get okay. So I got a rain dog taunt

544
02:00:09,170 --> 02:00:26,789
I got a taz skin. I already had tokens. Okay, cool. Happy fin hover taunt for superman. All right, let's do some teams

545
02:00:27,189 --> 02:00:36,869
I'm just gonna mess around with teams. We'll close it out with teams. Yeah, so they're gonna be adding um

546
02:00:37,989 --> 02:00:42,630
Black adam and stripe will be coming at some point soon during I think this season

547
02:00:42,949 --> 02:00:54,800
I'm curious with how stripe stripe stripe is gonna be a bruiser. I'd imagine. All right, let's do some teams

548
02:00:57,760 --> 02:01:04,000
Do I stick with gizmo or do I play with somebody else I feel like well, let's try the new skin. I mean, come on

549
02:01:06,470 --> 02:01:20,260
Is taz any good anymore? I haven't really played with taz at all. You don't it's still taz

550
02:01:23,810 --> 02:01:28,229
Well, yeah, because I don't have any currency. I don't have any uh in-game money

551
02:01:35,119 --> 02:01:41,600
That's not gizmo. It's close enough. This is chad gizmo

552
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:56,180
Have any of you guys actually been really putting time into the game?

553
02:02:00,050 --> 02:02:11,250
Who do you think is the best character in the game right now? Jake?

554
02:02:11,890 --> 02:02:26,720
Is it gizmo gizmo feels really good. Oh, I caught them both

555
02:02:40,359 --> 02:02:50,210
In aria. Oh, yeah, wait, you can do his sandwich more than a few times, right?

556
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:24,319
Oh

02:03:24,319 --> 02:03:28,609
Oh got it not good enough though, where am I what's my character I died

558
02:03:29,810 --> 02:03:31,810
What was that voice by the way?

559
02:03:32,369 --> 02:03:35,489
That was like a uh, please put this in the youtube video voice

560
02:03:50,050 --> 02:03:52,050
I just I just pulled this back

561
02:03:57,960 --> 02:04:03,260
Oh, we did it rain dog. Nice job. I don't know. I kind of don't know what happened but whatever

562
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:32,640
He's not in the reddit room anymore, oh, that's right it looks different doesn't it

563
02:04:39,140 --> 02:04:41,300
Let's all fight fair and this should be fun

564
02:04:43,270 --> 02:04:49,619
How's auto auto's doing great. He's he's a little he's a little chunky, but we're working on it

565
02:04:50,180 --> 02:05:20,659
Let's do that. We'll do a few more. We should see him again. All right on the next stream. I'll show auto

566
02:05:22,050 --> 02:05:30,529
Um, i'll let you see the dog. He's doing good. He's happy. I think he's just hanging out

567
02:05:30,609 --> 02:05:41,989
He's sleeping in the other room start. I ran out of water

568
02:05:41,989 --> 02:05:57,840
I was too busy putting it in my eyes. Remember to blink when you're in those, uh, deep gaming hours guys

569
02:05:58,399 --> 02:06:30,479
It's got stuck on the lip

570
02:06:30,479 --> 02:06:32,659
Jesus behind me

571
02:06:32,659 --> 02:06:51,060
That's how you get it done. Excuse me

572
02:07:26,159 --> 02:07:37,000
What happened doesn't it just does harley quit have a tv show by a new tv show what doesn't jump off

573
02:07:44,340 --> 02:07:48,050
Is it any good?

574
02:07:52,289 --> 02:07:56,949
It's not new and it's three seasons old. Oh, is it any good though? It's okay

575
02:08:05,380 --> 02:08:11,960
I love chat the only place where I can look over here and see yeah, it's pretty decent and then right underneath that

576
02:08:12,789 --> 02:08:18,869
It's fucking awful, dude

577
02:08:27,239 --> 02:08:34,239
I can't I feel like i'm doing i'm neglecting lebron. I really like lebron. Let's get it

578
02:08:40,630 --> 02:08:45,909
Asking thousands of people their opinion on something. Yeah, it's just funny though. Just looking over and seeing it in real time

579
02:08:58,789 --> 02:08:59,829
Batman's fun

580
02:08:59,829 --> 02:09:04,180
I feel like I need to go through and play all the characters again

581
02:09:05,380 --> 02:09:13,729
Just in the lab because I really did just pick bugs bunny because I love the looney tunes. What the hell is this?

582
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:27,189
start time

583
02:09:27,189 --> 02:09:41,250

584
02:09:43,239 --> 02:09:46,119
I don't know if that's possible. I'm not sure big bird can be in this game

585
02:10:06,449 --> 02:10:07,729
Whoa

586
02:10:07,729 --> 02:10:21,159

587
02:10:21,880 --> 02:10:32,630
Oh my god, that movie's crazy

Like that. Yeah, give me money

595
02:13:03,779 --> 02:13:05,380
The mic ruined it

596
02:13:05,380 --> 02:13:26,390
This mic stinks. This mic stinks. I'm done with it. It eats every weird noise

597
02:13:26,390 --> 02:13:37,220
It eats every funny noise you make. I don't know why okay. Can if I don't know can you know

598
02:13:40,680 --> 02:13:52,500
Did that come through or did that get uh blocked out? So wait, it's only high noises. That's weird

599
02:13:52,899 --> 02:14:01,800
There must be some pitch that this mic does not like. All right, this is it last one. Let's go

600
02:14:02,840 --> 02:15:09,510
Let's do it. Let's make it happen

601
02:15:21,880 --> 02:15:23,560
Oh

602
02:15:23,560 --> 02:15:29,250
It didn't get hit by that. That's kind of weird

603
02:15:33,319 --> 02:15:35,640
All right, we gotta can we launch somebody out of here, please?

604
02:15:36,279 --> 02:15:39,140
What are we doing?

605

All right. I'm just like pressing buttons. I gotta like actually play the game

And you let's pull it together here

613
02:16:47,170 --> 02:17:21,200
Isn't that priority?

614
02:17:22,370 --> 02:17:24,930
What what happened? Why couldn't I move what?

615
02:17:25,889 --> 02:17:27,250
Excuse me

616
02:17:27,250 --> 02:17:29,250

I literally just turned into a pencil and went straight down and I was pressing buttons

623
02:18:24,399 --> 02:18:52,229
It counted for us sag. I'm sorry. I'll do better david jake though

That's my kryptonite a lot of my points are on the line

625
02:19:10,709 --> 02:19:18,870
A lot of you are voting for is that for me or against me? Because that's a lot. That's a big difference

626
02:19:27,969 --> 02:19:29,170
Oh, okay

Also, yeah, thanks one brothers again for sponsoring the stream I genuinely love playing this game so

641
02:24:20,709 --> 02:24:30,340
It's just that's really awesome that I can just get sponsored to do it game's really fun if you haven't checked it out

642
02:24:36,040 --> 02:24:41,879
Season one is underway right now. I think that we're gonna see some more characters and probably ranked and some other stuff

643
02:24:42,360 --> 02:24:52,600
Don't do sorcery on sunday. We'll figure it out. I don't know if I would bet on this one

644
02:24:52,600 --> 02:24:54,600
It's a 1v1 with a character. I haven't been playing

645
02:24:55,159 --> 02:25:09,799
Yeah, I I love taking sponsors like this because I I actually like this game

646
02:25:10,440 --> 02:25:12,120
I really really do

647
02:25:12,120 --> 02:25:14,360
So it's perfect

648
02:25:14,360 --> 02:25:15,799
All right, let's see if I can do it

649
02:25:15,799 --> 02:25:39,280
What the fuck is going on?

650
02:25:40,610 --> 02:25:42,610
What the hell is happening?

651
02:26:11,940 --> 02:26:13,940
So confused

652
02:26:33,170 --> 02:27:12,799
I get a turkey it's all over. I don't know. Did you vote for me? Because I did not think I was gonna win that

653
02:27:18,579 --> 02:27:20,770
All right, that's it

654
02:27:20,770 --> 02:27:23,649

And we'll see you again

658
02:27:35,139 --> 02:28:29,020
This one doesn't count. It's just an extra bonus one. I mean I have to do the rematch. I can't just say no

659
02:28:29,260 --> 02:28:41,100
That's not how it works. If somebody says rematch you say all right, let's go for it unless there's internet problems. Come on unwritten rule

660
02:31:34,850 --> 02:31:37,790
Please juggle germa on stream and teken
