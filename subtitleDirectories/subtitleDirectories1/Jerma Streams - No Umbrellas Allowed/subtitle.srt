1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:07,660
I'll tell you, all of you that tell me that that taking the going to the bathroom the second way

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:14,119
takes less than 10 minutes. Nope. No, it does not. I don't know how the how you do that. How's it

3
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:21,769
possible? How do you take five? No, it does not. No way. I don't believe that person at all. It is

4
00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:29,879
such it takes so much. You have to get in there. You have to get comfortable. That takes about 60

5
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:39,539
seconds. Then you have to be ready. If sometimes it's not all the way ready. That takes a good

6
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:51,210
solid minute or two for that to happen. Simply simply wiping your eye takes like at least a few

7
00:00:51,210 --> 00:01:10,180
minutes. You can't say I can't say that. That's a bad word. And then after you're done, you have to

8
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:17,659
you sit there and contemplate the world for five minutes. That is the best place to decompress

9
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:24,379
all knowledge in your brain. You sit there and you die. You just you just take the world in for like

10
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:36,409
five to 10 minutes. If I don't get my decompress the world time, I did not go number two. If I

11
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:43,819
don't get that five minutes of like opening up a Twitter thread and judging every single person

12
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:48,870
in it. If I don't get that five minutes on the toilet, I'm sorry. I did not go number two.

13
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:11,560
Are you even potty trained? Imagine like I don't I have one of those like little toilets with little

14
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:22,409
kids. Remember why is there no plumbing installed in your house? I don't I don't know what I don't

15
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:40,919
know why. I don't know what that is. Not potty trained. You're gonna love them. A tweet? Oh shit

16
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:44,840
you're right tweet. Anyways the the reason people saying why you're talking about this. This is why

17
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:52,870
the stream is 20 minutes late. What's that um Newton's third law of aerodynamics? Anything that

18
00:02:52,870 --> 00:03:03,000
can go wrong will go wrong. Somebody somebody made that up. That's somebody's law. Murphy's law. Okay

19
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,580
yeah right. Like Otto had to go to the bathroom. I had to go to the bathroom. I was hearing a weird

20
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:15,419
noise. I had to like investigate the noise. I need to water my I have plant. I need to water my plant.

21
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:35,189
When is the McDickie game night? Soon but not next week or the week after. All right so let's

22
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:41,240
uh here's his plan. Let me tell you what's going on here. Hello welcome back by the way. What kind

23
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:47,610
of plant? It's a money tree because it's like I think it's a cool looking it's a it's a little

24
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:53,580
money tree. It's a braided money tree and um if you have one of those in your house then you get

25
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:58,219
you you get to be you're a millionaire. You get to be a millionaire right? I water it every day and

26
00:03:58,219 --> 00:04:01,819
I fucking make sure it's completely healthy and I put it in the exact spot it wants to be in in the

27
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:10,259
sun. Except here's the funny thing about a money tree. I believe you're supposed to be gifted a

28
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:14,819
money tree. I don't think you're supposed to just buy one and hope to be a millionaire. Like it's

29
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:21,689
not a scratch ticket. I like I don't know that's not accurate. I believe you suppose you're supposed

30
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:31,660
to be gifted one. You don't just buy one like a fucking lottery ticket. No I like plants now. I'm

31
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:39,350
a plant person now okay. I've got like three plants in my place and I take very good care of them

32
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:47,670
and they have names too Huey, Dewey, and Louie. Let me tell you Louie is quite the troublemaker.

33
00:04:48,310 --> 00:05:39,110
He's quite a troublemaker. All right let me I'll be right back. Let me tweet. I didn't even tweet.

34
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:47,670
I'll tweet right now. Oh by the way the people asking about the title. Okay the reason why the

35
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:57,620
title is the way it is is because think of every pawn tv show or media. It's always about like porn.

36
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:10,060
Hardcore pawn. Okay pawn stars. Pawn. Porn. So I figured that you know the generation the zoomers

37
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:17,980
and the millennials will understand this one. And coming up next on enough pawn tabs to crash my

38
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:37,399
computer. They're gonna buy a helicopter. Will they? Oh you guys are pretty torn on this title.

39
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:49,139
I'm not sure. I don't know how to how to gauge it. Stop with the plus twos chat. It was clearly a

40
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:56,199
minus two. Oh you guys can debate that for a little while. Okay all right it's a pawn game.

41
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:00,439
It looks really fun. It looks really engaging. It looks really interesting. So we're gonna play it.

42
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:08,629
What am I talking about? Have you not seen any pawn tv show? They're all porn references.

43
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:20,360
Hardcore pawn and pawn stars. What are you talking about? How dare you? Okay pawn shop game.

44
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:37,910
Here's the twitter. Here's the twitter. Okay I know I can set this to be auto tweet but I don't

45
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:46,550
want to connect my twitch to anything. It always freaks me out. All right tweet is out. We can get

46
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:57,829
started here in a sec. The creative technology. I don't know. I just don't like connecting everything.

47
00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:05,189
You're making this up. What am I? All right now I'm just being.

48
00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:14,410
Hold on a second. My laundry is almost done. I just went into spin cycle. I'm just trying to

49
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:26,329
play a game here man. What's that? Popcorn? Yeah I got a popcorn machine right here. Are you angry?

50
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:30,250
I'm not angry. I got like a frog in my throat today though so you can hear a lot of like

51
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:40,220
mutes like that. I got this like annoying frog. It won't go away. All right let's go. I think

52
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:59,769
we're ready. Aren't we? I think so. This is called no umbrellas allowed and I'm very excited. Do a

53
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:04,250
ribbit. Oh speaking of ribbits. I got a quick story for you. It's really really small. You know

54
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:09,370
when you do one of those burps that's an internal burp. It's almost like a frog burp where your

55
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:16,500
stomach goes like and it comes back down really fast. So I had my iPad on my. I have like a

56
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:23,269
little thing that holds my iPad and it just sits in this little tray and I put that on my stomach

57
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:27,830
and it's like it has like a keyboard too. So it's like a little like half fake laptop little thing

58
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:33,029
and I did one of those. I was just sitting there with my arms behind my head watching like a YouTube

59
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:38,299
video and I went like and the thing bounced up like I like somebody was on a trampoline

60
00:09:38,299 --> 00:09:46,340
and it almost hit me right in the face. It was it was scary. It bounced like and hit like almost

61
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:55,370
hit me right in the like bottom lip. It was terrifying. All right we're gonna play a new game.

62
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:13,509
2080 Ajik City. My throat is annoying. It was a cool story. I told you it wasn't even a story.

63
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:18,279
Last night there was a massive explosion at the Citizens Alliance Research Institute,

64
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:26,809
a central bunker district. Due to the explosion most of the artificial rain tech files and the

65
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:33,350
fixer manufacturing facilities are all gone. Get some water. I've been drinking water all morning.

66
00:10:33,909 --> 00:10:37,350
I had a big salad too. I had a whole. I almost ate an entire avocado today. Hopefully I don't

67
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:43,190
shit my pants. The government and the Association of Victims of Avarice Crimes have announced that

68
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:50,490
they need at least eight more weeks to resume the fixerian project. Now Ajik City, the last city

69
00:10:50,490 --> 00:11:14,629
waiting for the fix rain, is to stay dry for a few more weeks. Hey are you dead? Please help me.

70
00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:22,419
Shush. An AVAC guy is coming. Hey Cheb thanks for the 25 community subs. Listen to me. What the

72
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:38,220

73
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:48,440
Is he from the institute? No this is my son. He's got weak legs since he was a child. It's typical.

74
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:54,779
Don't worry. Do you need any help? No everything's fine. As long as every character is over the age

75
00:11:54,779 --> 00:12:10,889
of 70 today I'll be able to be fine. Lucky me you fit the profile.

76
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:28,600
Pudding throat. I know I'm trying to work on it. Hey you're here. The doctor said your face got the

77
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:36,460
most injuries so he covered your whole face with bandages. You can take them off after a week but

78
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:47,779
he's not sure your face will be the same as it was before. Ah I'm Darcy just an old-timer who owns a

111
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:41,509
at the log all right so we have to go to work this is Darcy's here so here's like the different

112
00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:52,380
let's go I'm Hugh people call me the sphinx of Darcy's and you are you look much better now

113
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:57,980
welcome to Darcy's the secondhand shop I've been running this place for more than 30 years

114
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:05,539
as I told you you are now my son Bob who will inherit this store from me that is why I picked

115
00:18:05,539 --> 00:18:11,220
you up from the beach AVAC's been pestering me about what it is whereabouts and I needed to

116
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:18,980
stand in for Bob yeah after all that time now they're looking for Bob oh but Darcy what if

117
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:25,400
Bob comes back out of the blue that is not gonna happen it's almost a decade since he left by the

118
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:32,730
way this one here is Hugh it's got a mouth on it but it will be of help anyways now let's start

119
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:40,089
discussing what you're gonna do here at here you're going to both buy and sell things and you must

120
00:18:40,089 --> 00:18:44,920
stay alert at all times every customer wants to get paid more money that's because this place

121
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:52,089
is off the grid from the citizen discourse data radar can I go home what the fuck is this I did

122
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:56,900
that so I don't have to care about what the AVAC is doing in here there are side effects just like

123
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:03,799
Hugh said customers all get so cocky as soon as they get in here anyway for today I'll teach you

124
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:09,690
how to negotiate price when buying things that's where to start when buying things it's really

125
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:15,990
important to find a balance it has to be a price that the customer can accept and that can still

126
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:23,690
make you a profit when resold they can't just start yelling out prices why not you must praise

127
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:31,380
the item first when it comes to appraising things I use cards do the voice fuck customers

128
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:40,740
introduce their items with cards gray card is base information base price it's a cup if without a

129
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:47,579
lack of fins or a long tongue okay it's a cup a green card is detailed information and changes

130
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:56,410
in price so I get detailed info from like so there's different rarities so if it's a green

131
00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:03,539
card it's like okay this is could be the prices could be changed a lot here oh I forgot the blue

132
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:09,299
cards green cards include object objective information on the other hand blue cards are

133
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:17,849
close to opinions just like how damaged how popular or rare an item is so this is people

134
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:22,650
come in they go hey you die this is this is worth like fucking 50 bucks and it's worth like 30

135
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:34,900
sharing blue cards are like sharing your opinion at which customers may protest or get mad okay

136
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:40,099
card slot what the fuck is this to share a card with a customer you must insert the card in the

137
00:20:40,099 --> 00:20:47,299
card slot combination of cards yields a price you can use it as a guideline while bargaining

138
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:54,500
all right so I have like the combination is the price of the of the actual item is it a card it's

139
00:20:54,500 --> 00:21:01,940
not a card game don't worry about too much about colors for now focus on bargaining the price based

140
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:10,089
on the cards here the gray card for this bag says bag bags are usually sold for 100 vannas let's

141
00:21:10,089 --> 00:21:15,210
say brand a is pretty high end which means the price goes up by 200 v bucks whatever I don't

142
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:20,250
care minus two me cowhide means adding an extra 50 v bucks to them and finally the price went down

143
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:25,589
by 20 percent is just slightly damaged now you can start bargaining based on the price these

144
00:21:25,589 --> 00:21:33,369
cards have set and you see 280 v below the card slots that's the guideline you can suggest 280

145
00:21:33,369 --> 00:21:40,539
from the start if you want to go easy you want to make a profit you better cut it at least one third

146
00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:49,500
jesus decide how much to offer at first offer less than 70 percent of the guideline make an offer use

147
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:54,650
the calculator to set its buying price and press offer say yes or no to a customer's offer to say

148
00:21:54,650 --> 00:22:03,000
yes press accept if no insert a new number and press offer fuck we have to do math so since this

149
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:10,220
is your first offer you can be a little bolder use the calculator on your own and try okay so

150
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:18,089
this is a bag just a regular bag it's damaged but it's from a decent brand and it's made of a cowhide

151
00:22:18,089 --> 00:22:24,869
I'll give you let me do the thing that they do in pawn stars first of all he goes

152
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:25,529
okay

153
00:22:27,269 --> 00:22:33,960
ah the best i can do is 40 bucks and the guy comes in wanting like 500 he laughs again really loud

154
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:43,420
okay so let's just should we do 40 dollars all right so let's just i'll give you i'll give you

155
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:51,609
150 bucks for it about 150 no this time we do as i said 190 what what no you tell me whatever

156
00:22:52,170 --> 00:23:00,250
the best i can all right man the best i can do is 190 good but mostly customers won't accept

157
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:05,579
your first offer instead they will make a counter offer like this about 240

158
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:12,440
now man i'm telling you i i gotta put this on the shelf i don't know who's gonna buy this

235
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:57,930
alliance research institute the investigation is focused on finding if the fire was a mere

236
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:05,180
unfortunate accident or an act of arson it's clearly arson everyone was just waiting for

237
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:11,750
someone to act whoever set that place on fire i'm fully behind them next up professor yang ji

238
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:18,460
choy is staging a one-man protest against avac he argues that the lack of clear standards for

239
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:26,200
what are and are not avarice crimes will cause huge confusion he also claims avac is interpreting

240
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:33,380
the law however they please leading to the incarceration of innocent citizens i respect

241
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:39,099
his courage but don't think you don't think he's all talk why can't he do something real like that

242
00:33:39,099 --> 00:33:48,009
arsonist oh do you want something can i help you what are you doing in here the rules must

243
00:33:48,009 --> 00:33:57,460
be ambiguous and penalties must be harsh to make the citizens behave sounds not working i told

244
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:03,700
darcy to at least get a somewhat decent tv television citizens of ajax city the bunker

299
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:35,559
and babies are very cute and very very very nice but unfortunately for me it's made out of wood

300

and was not very good at a sale again i don't think i'll be able to sell it chum chum chum

306
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:36,550
best i can do is 42 works for me all right she wanted 41 well this is what happens this is what

307
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:40,550
happens when there's no communication the four of them just run around the store and they just

308
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:51,750
don't talk to each other my ass why is she being so weird bob this is nary joe she's your fake niece

309
00:42:54,059 --> 00:43:01,880
all right wait a minute everybody hold on i back up i gotta go to the back room okay i've got this

310
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:12,219
baby toy praise it let's let's put it up there for 50 i got this book of smells raise it forward

311
00:43:12,219 --> 00:43:18,780
this is worth a lot let's go i'm this one's 60 in fact get the shit out of here i'm putting this in

312
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:28,980
here this is recommended 60 bucks holy markup it's not a markup i had to restore it okay filling

313
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:34,980
out the book here you mean he's my fake uncle why would bob leave bluebird for a shithole like this

314
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:40,139
in the first place hey you if you're dreaming about inheriting the store you'd better shut it

315
00:43:40,139 --> 00:43:49,429
off right now because there's no seat for a bogus son like you this place is supposed to be mine

316
00:43:49,429 --> 00:44:01,769
once grandpa passes away the crap and buy off this cup how do you keep bringing garbage like this

317
00:44:01,769 --> 00:44:09,210
do i have to explain why don't you sell your paintings you have tons of them stop that joke

318
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:13,530
do you think i'd sell my works to a place like this please think before you open your mouth

319
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:24,090
quit whining and take this cup for 90 bucks you know that's a special deal first of all first of

320
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:36,980
all that's way too high second of all a cup like that i mean did did george washington drink out of

321
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:42,090
it because if i get a guy in here and we figure out we do like a dna test on it and then i can

322
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:53,500
sell for like 20 000 but no 90 bucks no way 90 dollars for a cup no looks like someone needs

323
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:59,699
a lesson and let me make this one thing clear george washington did drink out of this if you

324
00:44:59,699 --> 00:45:07,159
ever ruin this soon to be inherited i'll make you into a hue just like that thing crossing the line

325
00:45:07,159 --> 00:45:17,369
nari i mean once grandpa finds out what a deadbeat you are he'll handle it himself stay strong i'm

399
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:46,889

400
00:56:50,969 --> 00:56:54,730
you haven't run away yet now it's time for me to teach you how to check materials and damage

401
00:56:54,730 --> 00:57:01,420
levels let's look at that bag from yesterday i said that this bag is in perfect condition but

402
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:08,219
before moving on to the next step you should check for yourself by using a tool praising an item oh

403
00:57:08,219 --> 00:57:15,260
here we go customers sometimes lie means you have to check each card carefully they show you

404
00:57:15,769 --> 00:57:22,380
scrutinize an item use the tools in the manual oh boy insert cards from the manual pull out

405
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:27,719
cards and insert them into the card slot if you're wrong customers mostly turn it down

406
00:57:27,719 --> 00:57:36,900
what a slurp i'm fine here's the toolbox click the damage assessor and move it onto the bag

407
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:43,590
it's in the second slot holy shit this is gonna get well isn't gonna get wacky here are the two

408
00:57:43,590 --> 00:57:49,659
essential tools damage assessor and material magnifier this measures damage level and this

409
00:57:49,659 --> 00:58:04,090
shows what texture it actually is okay so you're saying that this is it's not really

410
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:09,690
perfect right and let's move on to its material click the material magnifier and move it onto

411
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:15,849
the bag wait so the happy face means perfect this is what a stupid meter this is a baby toy

412
00:58:15,849 --> 00:58:26,599
i'm gonna look like an idiot you see its material up close but you can't tell what exactly it is

413
00:58:26,599 --> 00:58:38,389
for now that's what you need this manual for oh my god the manual complements your knowledge

414
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:43,980
and expertise you use keyboard shortcuts to navigate efficiently lets you move to each page

415
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:51,579
right this is where you pull out cards from in the manual okay in the text page what are the

416
00:58:51,579 --> 00:58:55,980
manual list in the manual okay the material list find out which material looks closest to what

417
00:58:55,980 --> 00:59:01,619
you just saw drag the one you found from the list of the slot you'll be pulling out a card

418
00:59:01,619 --> 00:59:14,599
and putting it in the slot it's this one yeah it's this one cowhide oh leather cowhide but

419
00:59:14,599 --> 00:59:21,340
now that's what's worth more money it's cowhide that's it did you see the card and the price change

420
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:25,659
next let's head to the condition page from the manual list use the damage assessor again and

421
00:59:25,659 --> 00:59:36,070
decide which damage level it falls into this would be i would say this would be slightly damaged

422
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:47,159
this is slightly damaged it's not perfect condition ooh cards in the slot are tagged to items and

423
00:59:47,159 --> 00:59:54,380
shared with customers as you put things on the showcase oh to let customers know this item is

424
00:59:54,380 --> 01:00:02,139
worth this much cards have to be accurate and concrete to earn trust of customers and with

425
01:00:02,139 --> 01:00:08,550
trust you will be able to sell more so keep in mind to use the tools in the manual there's one

426
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:14,860
more once a customer accepts a card you can't undo it which means you cannot remove or replace

427
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:19,340
cards once the deal is closed so don't lose focus during an appraisal it's the only chance you can

428
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:24,599
decide which card to tag onto an item this is one last thing you have to keep in mind during

429
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:34,599
appraisal okay reputational card too this card gives you more advantages as your appraising skill

430
01:00:34,599 --> 01:00:39,480
improves customers will begin to buy items appraised by us without any doubt or even paying

431
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:45,340
more it's a reputation scam everyone will only scam some people i can't say we're gonna scam

432
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:50,619
everybody but we'll scam whoever we need to it doesn't show up from the beginning but

433
01:00:50,619 --> 01:00:55,099
right after appraising and purchasing so it's automatically attached to items after you appraise

434
01:00:55,099 --> 01:01:03,400
so i have to get that skill up you already mentioned the card wittiness of darcy's right

435
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:10,519
oops these three cards indicate our store's reputation from three different views these

436
01:01:10,519 --> 01:01:15,739
are special because they improve themselves along with you better you get the more effective each

437
01:01:15,739 --> 01:01:20,760
card will be by driving the bargain to your advantage or encouraging customers to buy each

438
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:26,780

551
01:18:01,050 --> 01:18:06,970

552
01:18:06,970 --> 01:18:14,460
can i say that it's an old joke i've been going for 10 years all right we can do old stuff

553
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:24,789
all right that's fine we're good you may get soaked up to the bone be careful bob

554
01:18:25,979 --> 01:18:30,789
all right so i can't it's raining out what the why is it raining is it fixed rain

555
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:49,960
no relax it's just ordinary rain how would we tell the difference any money in the trash lucky me

556
01:18:51,449 --> 01:19:04,760
what i get gotcha lucky me what i get i didn't get anything run home no you don't run home in

557
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:09,130
this scenario those of you that had a bus stop and you went you walked to the bus stop

558
01:19:09,689 --> 01:19:12,489
or if you were walking to work or whether if you get off of like the subway or whatever

559
01:19:13,210 --> 01:19:17,689
this kind of rain you see people sprinting around and panicking but it's already over

560
01:19:18,569 --> 01:19:24,090
if you stand in this for more than five seconds it's over already you might as well just walk

561
01:19:24,090 --> 01:19:32,229
normally you're not oh no i gotta rush really fast to get out of this rain you're already

562
01:19:32,229 --> 01:19:44,899
somebody dumped a bucket of water on your head already it's over let's get running and all running

563
01:19:44,899 --> 01:19:49,770
does is just makes it hit you in the eyes because if you run really fast you're giving yourself

564
01:19:49,770 --> 01:19:54,569
like this perpetual forward motion so the rain droplets actually hit inside your eyeballs

565
01:19:55,529 --> 01:20:01,079
you know i don't know what that fucking rain's been i don't want rain in my mouth i don't want

566
01:20:01,079 --> 01:20:04,840

turning it down this is never our decision darcy she's just like her father she's dreaming of

642
01:32:35,689 --> 01:32:40,329
becoming an artist even in a situation like this without adac both nari and her father would have

643
01:32:40,329 --> 01:32:44,649
been following their dream by now i could do anything for nari to let her enter the bunker

644
01:32:44,649 --> 01:32:50,619
so she won't get fixed as her father did harry's dad took off to haga city a few years ago saying

645
01:32:50,619 --> 01:32:56,460
he'd become a great painter haga city is where artists used to live in groups but you know fixed

01:32:56,460 --> 01:33:02,779
rain came down over all the country now he's trying to hide it but she's going through a lock

650
01:33:36,579 --> 01:33:46,390
me think for one more second in my opinion 93 dollars is just about right oh you know what fine

651
01:33:46,390 --> 01:34:01,770
i'll take it quite good at hitting a happy medium breaking news more than 60 citizens are

652
01:34:01,770 --> 01:34:06,010
complaining of severe cold symptoms after yesterday's rain one male citizen said not

653
01:34:06,010 --> 01:34:10,250
allowed to use an umbrella i was fully exposed to the rain that's why i caught a cold he also

654
01:34:10,250 --> 01:34:15,130
said i asked the association of victims of adverse crimes if they could let the elderly in the week

655
01:34:15,130 --> 01:34:20,409
use umbrellas the association however is not responding yet to his request this is reporter

682
01:38:46,439 --> 01:38:51,560
you to take emotion mitigation treatment emotion mitigation treatment basically suppresses your

683
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:57,670
emotions it's so expensive that you may feel you might as well become a fixie the reasons why some

684
01:38:57,670 --> 01:39:02,390
people desperately wait for fixed rain anyhow taking that treatment won't do any good for you

685
01:39:03,430 --> 01:39:07,989
to tell the truth it's pretty easy to avoid it you have to tell yourself you're a fixie and

686
01:39:07,989 --> 01:39:17,340
suppress all your emotions simply put just act like a fixie as best you can oh you know what

687
01:39:17,340 --> 01:39:27,750
i'm gonna say here it comes oh you can always tell because i go oh what about fixer his brain

688
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:34,340
must have been so messed up fixer is a drug to erase human emotions and desires people who got

689
01:39:34,340 --> 01:39:41,260
fixed are fixies people who haven't are called floaties fixies are nothing but the dead who still

690
01:39:41,260 --> 01:39:46,380
breathe they're unresponsive to whatever happens around them even when their house gets robbed

691
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:50,380
or when the avc takes away their family right before their very eyes they just stand there

692
01:39:50,380 --> 01:39:56,149
and watch no anger no sadness no desire nothing almost every citizen living in this country

693
01:39:57,189 --> 01:40:03,430
mindlessia is already a fixie except for those in this city it's because a year ago the association

694
01:40:03,430 --> 01:40:10,140
of victims of avers rained fixer all over the country except agic city we were lucky because

695
01:40:10,140 --> 01:40:15,100
the citizens of alliance and research institute exploded a few weeks ago that's how we became the

696
01:40:15,100 --> 01:40:22,069
last floaties in the whole country anyhow the stabilizer comes pretend you're an emotionless

697
01:40:22,069 --> 01:40:28,220
zombie and please don't say you don't know what zombie is even if he offends you or acts nice to

698
01:40:28,220 --> 01:40:33,510
you don't move a muscle there'll be only two choices left floaties who can't hide their emotions

699
01:40:33,510 --> 01:40:38,390
in front of stabilizers either get emotion mitigation treatment be labeled an avarice

700
01:40:38,390 --> 01:40:43,420
criminal i've seen countless people going bankrupt trying to afford emotion mitigation treatment

701
01:40:44,460 --> 01:40:49,979
once you're labeled as one of these criminals otherwise the avc will arrest you and fix you

702
01:40:50,779 --> 01:40:55,609
so never let the stabilizer get to you how will i know who the stabilizer is did he say i'm the

703

715
01:43:02,869 --> 01:43:08,550
lady after i saw you last time i couldn't stop thinking about jisu so i just dropped by my

716
01:43:08,550 --> 01:43:12,869
friend jisu was such a good person and really smart too he even got a job in the citizens

717
01:43:12,869 --> 01:43:19,130
alliance research institute but i heard he had a hard time there while doing all sorts of

718
01:43:19,130 --> 01:43:23,689
experiments on floaties and fixies must have been really painful for him to watch the experiments

719
01:43:23,689 --> 01:43:30,199
killing people and driving them crazy by the way here's a mars rock this one's worth five

720
01:43:30,199 --> 01:43:34,359
grand anyways it was jisu that i was looking for but after the fire in the institute he's

721
01:43:34,359 --> 01:43:42,899
gone missing however i will do anything to find him i'm sure he's still alive anyway it was great

722
01:43:42,899 --> 01:43:52,220
to see you again take care then and stopping by i thought she was hitting on you um well thanks

723
01:43:52,220 --> 01:44:02,460

724
01:44:02,460 --> 01:44:08,699
fair treaded commission and his roles to prevent and settle down the chaos of the city according

725
01:44:08,699 --> 01:44:14,600
to the citizen discourse data stabilizers usually create even more chaos knock it off i'm not like

726
01:44:14,600 --> 01:44:20,779
those idiots nothing none of them can pick on floaties as skillfully as i do oh so you're proud

727
01:44:20,779 --> 01:44:29,300
of it by the way why do you have your face wrapped up like that is that a problem of course i just

728
01:44:29,300 --> 01:44:34,579
see the face to decide whether he needs emotion mitigation treatment or not maybe i can put him

729
01:44:34,579 --> 01:44:42,520
under intensive care he's been in bluebird for a decade huh and the bell is on you shut up time

730
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:47,640
to see how good your master is at restraining his emotions you better be completely honest question

731
01:44:47,640 --> 01:44:59,500
number one if i say i need tons of money right now are you going to ask me why no don't be serious

732
01:44:59,500 --> 01:45:06,630
it's just a test now if i say i need a hundred dollars from you are you going to give me that

733
01:45:06,630 --> 01:45:15,159
no don't need to be so serious i don't need your pocket money let's just stop this shit i can take

734
01:45:15,159 --> 01:45:25,380
you straight to abac and give you a dose of fixer sure is that an easy decision for you

735
01:45:25,380 --> 01:45:36,199
wacko are you upset now no but your voice is telling me different here take this money and

736

738
01:45:55,909 --> 01:46:05,850

739
01:46:07,140 --> 01:46:15,029

740
01:46:15,029 --> 01:46:21,270
yes i want you to leave but is yes more emotional like i want you to get out of here because you're

741
01:46:21,270 --> 01:46:26,149
annoying or no i want to keep you here because i'm like i like this conversation too much which

742
01:46:26,149 --> 01:46:43,479
one is correct yes implies want yes is more emotional no no here's your result there were

743
01:46:43,479 --> 01:46:49,060
some points your emotion level exceeded the limit but i'll cut you some slack for now they don't

744
01:46:49,060 --> 01:46:55,850
want to give up this fun too soon how evil but i will keep watching you remember i'm always ready

745
01:46:55,850 --> 01:47:05,109
to put you in the treatment process fast you're not a good actor by the way to look like a fixer

746
01:47:05,109 --> 01:47:09,590

794
01:55:30,020 --> 01:55:35,720

795
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:39,939
ass that makes sense as to why they wouldn't want to do it again spend some more time on it

796
01:55:39,939 --> 01:55:47,369
stop just releasing fucking bloated shitty roster updates and nobody cares about did you get the

797
01:55:47,369 --> 01:55:54,819
year estimator back bunch of brought it yesterday but it was way past the due date anyhow it's

798
01:55:54,819 --> 01:56:02,550
time to learn how to read the chronological table toy car put the year estimator and put it on this

799
01:56:02,550 --> 01:56:14,329
toy the second slot to the right okay 2062 good the number 2062 you just saw is the exact year

800
01:56:14,329 --> 01:56:21,689
the toy was created items that are related to historical events are worth a lot more

801
01:56:21,689 --> 01:56:29,340
so this is the year list of historical events in that year and then pull up the card national

802
01:56:29,340 --> 01:56:43,020
historical value huh okay let's try it so this is the chronological table it should be a historical

803
01:56:43,020 --> 01:56:55,850
event in the year 2062 uh 2062 the recovery period but the year isn't all that counts

804
01:56:55,850 --> 01:57:04,729
take a look this toy isn't really related to the historical event that happened in 2062

805
01:57:04,729 --> 01:57:11,350
vroom vroom car fair trade fair trade commission this was also produced in 2062 take a look at the

806
01:57:11,350 --> 01:57:18,170
news article the beginning of a new era let's start together and run together says the president the

807
01:57:18,170 --> 01:57:21,800
government is planning to build a fair trade commission this one seems to be related to the

808
01:57:21,800 --> 01:57:31,270
event in 2062 okay then you can appreciate its historical value bald what why are you writing

809
01:57:31,270 --> 01:57:38,890
that of all like bald yeah the guy we have been playing for two hours that you can write that now

810
01:57:38,890 --> 01:57:55,770
all right national historical value times two this has historical value and i don't have any

811
01:57:55,770 --> 01:58:00,409
of those at the moment but those made before the 21st century century will also come in

812
01:58:00,409 --> 01:58:06,279
in that case you can appreciate its archaeological value those who collect and research things lost

813
01:58:06,279 --> 01:58:12,630
during the war and the flood in 2000 will go crazy for it so it's for your own good to use that card

814
01:58:12,630 --> 01:58:17,079
collectors even visit us to buy historical archaeological items and their budget is

815
01:58:17,079 --> 01:58:25,210
relatively high but it's also a good idea to wait for them looking for a higher margin by the way

816
01:58:25,210 --> 01:58:29,859
the signature detector is still in repair so i'll give it to you tomorrow see you then this is

817
01:58:29,859 --> 01:58:38,619
turning into like papers please but i like this game this is cool i like to buy the blue bird

818
01:58:38,619 --> 01:58:55,779
ocarina over there how much is it that'll be that's too much for this how about 60 basher where were

02:23:38,700 --> 02:23:44,729
last olympic medalist during practice he threw into the sea a thousand tennis balls which is

960
02:23:44,809 --> 02:23:56,219
considered very common okay this is very common so he used to write highly objective articles

961
02:23:56,219 --> 02:24:01,879
that people thought he equipped himself with a potato chip you see the list of types on the

962
02:24:01,879 --> 02:24:05,639
page i showed you earlier yeah okay so this is a common this is a this is like if it's this one

963
02:24:05,639 --> 02:24:25,000
that's worth a lot right this is signed by that's somebody else what seungri knows tennis ball this

964
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:33,219
is his tennis ball yeah this is his tennis ball no try again what this is not the right this is

965
02:24:33,219 --> 02:24:53,139
the wrong signature this is not this person other page read click on celebrity types okay he was a

966
02:24:53,139 --> 02:25:01,430
this is a he was a tennis player it's not a fake autograph it's asking for the celebrity type not

967
02:25:01,430 --> 02:25:07,139
the celebrity name oh okay i thought it was asking me like who like well what the fuck all right

968
02:25:07,139 --> 02:25:14,870
you're an athlete signature of an athlete good yeah i got now i literally just did all this i

969
02:25:14,870 --> 02:25:21,110
don't need a tutorial card you can pull out yeah i know i just did this i was way ahead of the

970
02:25:21,110 --> 02:25:35,139
tutorial if an autograph detected by the tool doesn't exist on the list or looks different

971
02:25:35,139 --> 02:25:40,920
you can use the card unidentified or fake autograph please remember even a slight

972
02:25:40,920 --> 02:25:44,840
difference in a stroke can make an autograph unidentifiable okay well it's gonna get weird

973
02:25:44,840 --> 02:25:51,159
you would even have to look at the curves or surfs when it is cleverly forged i can't speak

974
02:25:51,159 --> 02:25:57,750
there's one more thing the signature's list won't help when it comes to the type of great

975
02:25:57,750 --> 02:26:05,180
figure in world history you know i couldn't add every famous historical person to that list

976
02:26:05,180 --> 02:26:11,989
and most of their belongings have a certificate so when you want to use the card great figure

977
02:26:11,989 --> 02:26:18,010
in world history use your knowledge on world history don't get so stressed about with it i'm

978
02:26:18,010 --> 02:26:22,540
sure you won't need a thick history book by the way you can now unwrap the bandage around your

979
02:26:22,540 --> 02:26:29,930
face and don't be disappointed even if your face looks different why was bob's face what oh and

980
02:26:29,930 --> 02:26:34,180

1003
02:30:36,569 --> 02:30:43,620
the year 2072 nothing really significant about it but it was signed by somebody who exactly all

1004
02:30:43,620 --> 02:30:57,079
right who is that this one here who's this celebrity list a swimmer who missed an international match

1005
02:30:57,079 --> 02:31:02,600
because of his sleep avac accused him of sleeping too much forcing him to spend a month in prison

1006
02:31:02,600 --> 02:31:19,450
his signed goods will hurt our reputation that's accurate the swimmers is an athlete

1007
02:31:19,450 --> 02:31:39,579
uh it's an athlete and that athlete's name oh he's a criminal but he was but he was an athlete

1008
02:31:39,579 --> 02:31:51,540
do you know about him how can you even consider him an athlete after being incarcerated he's not

1009
02:31:51,540 --> 02:32:06,649
an athlete anymore but when he decided he was an athlete he was literally a fucking swimmer

1010
02:32:06,649 --> 02:32:13,479

1014
02:32:35,959 --> 02:32:39,899
signatures of people are signatures of people with bad reputations and unpopularity make even

1015
02:32:39,899 --> 02:32:44,379
the most popular and reputable brands products less popular of course it's good when unpopular

1016
02:32:44,379 --> 02:32:50,120
things get popular thanks to signatures but it's just annoying to see the value of an item going

1017
02:32:50,120 --> 02:32:59,500
up and down just because it has a signature i'm not buying that i don't want to hear all right

1103
02:47:53,079 --> 02:48:00,360
eyes than me all right what's this made out of like wavy this is made out of wiki tanness tree

1104
02:48:02,229 --> 02:48:11,110
a brand that is so unpopular that even avac won't give a dang about it who do i run the store do you

1105
02:48:11,110 --> 02:48:21,829
sometimes even leave out its slogan because all the hold on you're talking too fast so what

1106
02:48:21,829 --> 02:48:29,510
it means you have to check one more thing while appraising bob it's brand boy brand of an item

1107
02:48:29,510 --> 02:48:35,239
is a critical factor in the items price uh click each brand logo to read its details this that's

1108
02:48:35,239 --> 02:48:44,309
screwed a screamer guy but starbucks that's actually pretty cool that's funny uh you can

1109
02:48:44,309 --> 02:48:49,590
pull out cards from some of the description parts some brands only use their original materials

1110
02:48:49,590 --> 02:48:58,280
okay if a slogan is missing or wrong we can't say it's authentic for the manual go to the brand

1111
02:48:58,280 --> 02:49:14,260
and find everbrown okay materials brands those brands bird of brands all right wild car for

text for everbrown is a thumbnail of a material that looks like the one you saw take out that

1118
02:50:18,260 --> 02:50:25,319
card this is this kind of wood signature wood from uh from this brand pull out a card from

1119
02:50:25,319 --> 02:50:35,799
the sentence most products of which crack in less than a year potential garbage potentially a piece

1120
02:50:35,799 --> 02:50:41,399
of garbage okay potential garbage good job lastly pull up that card that says selling its products

1121
02:50:41,399 --> 02:50:51,510
is a good way to lose reputation this will hurt my reputation what is this an anger management

1122
02:50:51,510 --> 02:51:00,649
test i'm not selling i think i understand it let it go bob it was a piece of junk anyway you just

1123
02:51:00,729 --> 02:51:08,409
learned how to defend against brands with a negative image using the manual breaking news

1124
02:51:08,409 --> 02:51:15,459
the association has announced a new fining policy the new policy states that the fine amount

1125
02:51:15,459 --> 02:51:19,620
adverse criminals should pay to prove their non-possession spirit and avoid arrest will

1126
02:51:19,620 --> 02:51:27,270
determine by how rich they are for this the avac came up with a new concept called re-unionciation

1127
02:51:27,270 --> 02:51:32,729
rate renunciation rate refers to the percentage of property that must be given up to prove non-

1128
02:51:32,729 --> 02:51:39,559
possession spirit if re-unit whatever that word is is 10 percent and the property is 10 000 the

1129
02:51:39,559 --> 02:51:43,780
final we have thousand which is 10 of the property for all the citizens the initial rate is set at

1130
02:51:43,780 --> 02:51:48,729
five percent the av official said the rate can be raised or lower depending on the behavior of

1131
02:51:48,729 --> 02:51:55,370
each citizen along with this citizens who actively donate to the avac can now benefit more from this

1132
02:51:55,370 --> 02:52:02,299
evening each citizen's donation amount will be checked on a weekly basis oh fuck so i get lower

1133
02:52:02,299 --> 02:52:11,209
taxes if i donate to the avac this is a reporter okay there's a lot of new info here you look

1134
02:52:11,290 --> 02:52:18,790
familiar i'm a member of the association just call me mary don't worry i'm not here to take

1135
02:52:18,790 --> 02:52:25,540
you in i have a favor to ask of you i investigated these names on the list who are against fixed

1136
02:52:25,540 --> 02:52:31,979
rain uh he's an actor he loves to be recognized and be the center of attention he was outright

1137
02:52:31,979 --> 02:52:36,700
against fixed rain saying no one recognized him or like him anymore after it i have one

1138
02:52:36,700 --> 02:52:41,500
complaint about this game this is very annoying but i'm very annoyed by it uh next is professor

1139
02:52:42,139 --> 02:52:46,780
i am not skipping it's doing it i'm not clicking the arrow you do know he is on a solo protest

1140
02:52:46,780 --> 02:52:50,629
don't you i'd like to take i want to be able to take the information in more i don't just skip

1141
02:52:50,629 --> 02:52:54,549
it for me he's against every single one of the association policy is the most dangerous one

1142
02:52:54,549 --> 02:53:03,770
the last is seong-gong a member of our association i believe you've met him before but i can't find

1143
02:53:03,770 --> 02:53:10,680
where she's from who her family and friends are uh nothing however i can tell she joined the

1144
02:53:10,680 --> 02:53:18,260
association for her own reasons but first i want to take care of young ji mo and professor choi

1145
02:53:18,340 --> 02:53:25,100
these two these two people come in to sell anything tell them you'll pay a lot what i'm saying is

1146
02:53:25,100 --> 02:53:36,020
offer them at least double the evaluation price what i want it done this week and they may not

1147
02:53:36,020 --> 02:53:47,540
be idiots but likely to be adverse criminals okay hold on let's go to the settings no i can't it's

1148
02:53:47,540 --> 02:53:53,340
just skipping dialogue for me i don't like that like let me do why i even have the down arrow

1149
02:53:53,340 --> 02:54:11,000
that indicates so you can hit a or something how much is the emotion tracker emotion tracker

1150
02:54:12,200 --> 02:54:22,870
oh whoa wow 750 bucks he just came right in hold on bob there's a problem it seems the woman who

1151
02:54:22,870 --> 02:54:28,819
tried to sell us the everbrown ring is back biting us the citizen discourse data says she's telling

1152
02:54:28,819 --> 02:54:33,510
people we called her ring garbage didn't you really get it was the shitty ring and its owner

1153
02:54:33,510 --> 02:54:40,780
to be blamed but there are always people like her they're so malicious fortunately i don't see

1154
02:54:40,780 --> 02:54:45,260
any change in this card attracted us to darcy's however okay because we had a good reputation to

1155
02:54:45,260 --> 02:54:52,409
start with time has come to learn about the last reputation card attractiveness of darcy's this

1156
02:54:52,409 --> 02:54:58,069
card tells customers moods when they're leaving our store okay this card's effects will become

1157
02:54:58,069 --> 02:55:03,430
increasingly disadvantaged to you if you behave recklessly or hurt customers feelings by ignoring

1158
02:55:03,430 --> 02:55:10,469
their demands it only works during haggling and disappears right after your purchase causing a

1159
02:55:10,469 --> 02:55:19,459
change to the appraised value okay fyi or attractiveness doesn't go up and down in a flash

1160
02:55:19,459 --> 02:55:24,340
so please don't be too obsessed with it trying to be nice to every customer the plant is dying i

1161
02:55:24,340 --> 02:55:29,850
i can't water the plant normally the price effect of the card attracted will gradually fall below

1162
02:55:29,850 --> 02:55:35,379
zero and keep falling so i don't want to be still let us buy things at lower prices you don't have

1163
02:55:35,379 --> 02:55:39,379
to think so hard though just keep in mind that you reaching level five means your attractiveness

1164
02:55:39,379 --> 02:55:46,090
raging is its peak by the way she's so annoying okay kind of like you uh talking every day i need

1165
02:55:46,090 --> 02:55:55,049
somebody to fill up the showcase okay good how do i do this since i'm not an expert i don't know its

1166
02:55:55,049 --> 02:56:06,790
details but you're an expert you can find something right attractiveness of darcy's who's 67 all right

1167
02:56:06,790 --> 02:56:18,489
let's take a look uh it's not it's it's not damaged it's fine it's made out of wood wouldn't

1168
02:56:18,489 --> 02:56:26,420
yeah 2067 it said 2067 what do you got uh nothing significant on it but it's probably signed let's

1169
02:56:26,420 --> 02:56:32,059
take a look all right he's got no signature fun all right so how is this authentic how do i know

1170
02:56:32,059 --> 02:56:48,569
that they painted this i can't i don't know just wouldn't it's not a brand and this is wood i don't

1171
02:56:48,569 --> 02:56:52,250
know who painted that i can't be i can't validate this i'll give you a hundred fuck a hundred fucking

1172
02:56:52,250 --> 02:57:11,540
bucks for it i give you 450 this is a taxidermy how do you taxidermy a bug what are you talking

1173
02:57:11,540 --> 02:57:18,969
about oh no no no i was giving it a second thought if i could trust your recommendation the truth is

1174
02:57:18,969 --> 02:57:26,260
i'm in graphological study club and the club holds meetings every monday so i thought i could rely

1175
02:57:26,260 --> 02:57:32,459
on you to get something with an autograph for today's meeting but it occurred to me that your

1176
02:57:32,459 --> 02:57:36,700
recommendation may not be satisfying if your recommendation turns out to be reliable i'll come

1177
02:57:36,700 --> 02:57:44,920
back so i would love to turn over and talk to you guys but the game just skips all the dialogue

1178
02:57:44,920 --> 02:57:50,280
there's a full letter grade reduced for me that's a literally a full letter grade if that's a full

1179
02:57:50,280 --> 02:57:55,159
letter grade bob you've heard the news that avac found the fixed rain tech file see like i am

1180
02:57:55,159 --> 02:58:02,860
that's a full letter grade and the av uh okay like you're not allowed to not look at the screen

1181
02:58:02,860 --> 02:58:08,469
this is the time for our union to step up we got to hold a protest against fixed rain i know avac

1182
02:58:08,469 --> 02:58:13,030
has never told us they would stop the fixed rain if you're gonna have like 500 pages of dialogue in

1183
02:58:13,030 --> 02:58:17,909
a game let me like let me read it and decide when i'm ready to go like you can't just just like a

1184
02:58:17,909 --> 02:58:27,579
fucking cutscene i have to pay attention to hold shift i didn't do anything i've already asked all

1185
02:58:27,579 --> 02:58:37,719
the merchant members i'm holding shift right now no didn't do anything it's not a streamer game

1186
02:58:37,719 --> 02:58:40,360
even if i was just sitting here playing this like i can't even look what am i gonna look for somebody

1187
02:58:40,360 --> 02:58:46,389

1191
02:59:44,860 --> 02:59:48,940
for saying so that means all of our union members will be together with that in account i believe

1192
02:59:48,940 --> 02:59:55,430
avc won't ignore what we say the citizens will pay more attention to so right after you get off work

1193
02:59:55,430 --> 03:00:00,219
come up to the first floor we'll be there every evening you don't need to bring anything i'll

1194
03:00:00,219 --> 03:00:10,139
tell you what to do i have to do it every day what if i forget two pieces breaking news the first

1195
03:00:10,139 --> 03:00:15,899
piece of news after being arrested for excessive perfume usage a woman countersued an avac member

1196
03:00:15,899 --> 03:00:22,649
who arrested her the woman said he is holding a huge piece of bread when he arrested me claiming

1197
03:00:22,649 --> 03:00:30,020
eating that huge bread alone is also avarice on this matter professor young joe choi who is on

1198
03:00:30,020 --> 03:00:35,819
a solo protest said my concerns have become reality saying this is why i'm crying for clear

1199
03:00:35,819 --> 03:00:42,010
guidelines okay he's also making another claim of his own that abc is developing a new technology

1200
03:00:42,010 --> 03:00:48,899
to replace artificial rainfall new technology my ass if you say i declined to comment on this

1201
03:00:48,899 --> 03:00:54,500
claim next up more than 200 citizens are complaining of severe cold symptoms so what

03:01:01,959 --> 03:01:07,420

1236
03:05:27,459 --> 03:05:31,459
easy enough some of its products have soldiers names and those who believe in the rumor collect

1237
03:05:31,459 --> 03:05:38,729
them also sells goods other than bags uh this is no this they don't sell canvas bags this is fake

1239
03:06:03,510 --> 03:06:28,440
sorry that did seem cheap so i mean if you got a fake bag here there's a missing slogan too

1240
03:06:28,440 --> 03:06:31,399
usually there's a slogan on it they didn't yeah what are you talking about you aren't

1241
03:06:31,399 --> 03:06:35,559
making any sense what it says they have a slogan shit it does have a slogan on it it's right on

1242
03:06:35,559 --> 03:06:50,899
there fuck does it need a verifying autograph some of its products have names that's fine

1243
03:06:50,899 --> 03:07:04,420
you already confirmed it's fake i mean what does brand eraser do wrong slogan yeah that's what i

1244
03:07:04,420 --> 03:07:08,309

1249
03:07:47,579 --> 03:07:51,139
already told me there's nothing there's something wrong with the material and i've already agreed

1250
03:07:51,139 --> 03:08:19,659
it's not authentic easy enough yeah so i'm i wanted to keep the fucking label on it it's not a real

didn't they say these are 50 dollars don't sell them for more don't buy them for more

1255
03:09:17,430 --> 03:09:29,030
anything less than 50 would be profit i can't sell those i can't sell those umbrellas he's buying

1256
03:09:29,030 --> 03:09:33,030
them from you for 50 well look it's kind of hard to pay attention there's like eight different

store lines and like five different fucking organizations and like a bar of papers please

1258

for excuse my impatience i know i told you it's by friday and nobody came in with anything i've been

1332
03:28:16,790 --> 03:28:21,430
feeling i'm being chased by something these days because avac set me up as their number one target

1333
03:28:21,430 --> 03:28:27,930
you know avac hates me for standing against fixed rain my idea is that everyone has a right to

1334
03:28:27,930 --> 03:28:32,389
decide whether to get fixed or not when they first proposed their idea about fixed rain their excuse

1335
03:28:32,389 --> 03:28:37,559
was equality they claimed people with physical impairments were not having equal access to fixer

1336
03:28:37,559 --> 03:28:43,420
but but listen avac has never let people use umbrellas during fixed rain and they poured

1337
03:28:43,420 --> 03:28:52,420
down fixer like crazy for a week but i think that was the worst case of human rights trampling

1338
03:28:52,659 --> 03:28:56,420
i got carried away sorry there's the door right behind you if you're done

1339

1404
03:42:12,250 --> 03:42:17,639
here we go i have a restraint and greed free day okay let's go after the flood everyone was

1405
03:42:17,639 --> 03:42:23,059
looking for mona lisa like crazy but they ended up with nothing because it was in my hands but

1406
03:42:23,059 --> 03:42:30,379
you have the mona lisa the mona lisa you wouldn't dare say you don't know who painted this

1407
03:42:31,180 --> 03:42:37,319
and a painting like this deserves to be called at least great peace you can't call it great

1408
03:42:37,319 --> 03:42:44,920
peace by yourself great peace refers to a painting created by a famous artist you're saying some

1409
03:42:44,920 --> 03:42:54,600
nobody drew this painting that's terrible joke okay we have policies let's take a look okay

1410
03:42:54,600 --> 03:43:00,809
first check if there's a signature on the artwork when the signature is on the signatures list

1411
03:43:00,809 --> 03:43:08,229
when the signature is not on the list or no signature is found okay they're looking for

1412
03:43:08,229 --> 03:43:15,739
signatures again pull the out the art cards famous signatures okay you can see the signatures of the

1413
03:43:15,739 --> 03:43:25,590
famous use the signature detector on the painting yeah no signature it wasn't a signature on this

1414
03:43:25,590 --> 03:43:30,200
painting right that means you cannot use the celebrity signature list nor admit it as a

1415
03:43:30,200 --> 03:43:37,690
famous artist let's skip to the artwork page as this painting doesn't have any

1416
03:43:37,690 --> 03:43:44,809
autographs you should choose from either failed poor or fine piece failed piece refers to pieces

1417
03:43:44,809 --> 03:43:53,450
that seem to be drawn by foot fine piece refers to carefully drawn paintings or pieces somewhere

1418
03:43:53,450 --> 03:44:04,500
between those two how would i be able to tell trash go on bob choose one i mean it's is it

1419
03:44:05,059 --> 03:44:21,319
technically a good fine piece okay well you didn't paint it with your foot that's clear right uh

1420
03:44:23,579 --> 03:44:28,489
failed it's no it's it's like a fine piece there's nothing wrong with it

1421
03:44:28,489 --> 03:44:41,479
looks good it's a fine piece that's a no it's a fine piece but uh artists on the list great

1422
03:44:41,479 --> 03:44:47,510
piece when it was created into artist prime when it's already dead but none of these make any more

1423
03:44:47,510 --> 03:45:00,659
sense you're not on the list so i don't do anything else there's no artist so what do i

1424
03:45:00,659 --> 03:45:11,270
have a option to pick this like nothing nobody there 1503 i mean that's a that's pretty fucking

1425
03:45:11,270 --> 03:45:39,540
old 1503 it's kind of archaeologically valuable is this the actual mona lisa it's slightly damaged

1426
03:45:39,540 --> 03:45:50,459
but did anybody paint real fake shit check the quality it's slightly damaged there's no

1427
03:45:50,459 --> 03:46:15,219
signature though is the actual mona lisa um okay i'll offer you 500 bucks for it okay i'm selling

1428
03:46:15,219 --> 03:46:22,969
this for a thousand some art collectors may visit the store they don't care about paying extra

1429
03:46:22,969 --> 03:46:26,819
so it's not a bad idea to not to not sell the artworks and wait for them to make a huge profit

1430
03:46:26,819 --> 03:46:43,129
oh shit deceased artist the the world's best crab grass on the showcase how much is it

1431
03:46:43,129 --> 03:46:55,879
in my opinion 42 is right mona lisa has no signature it doesn't i've never i've never

1432
03:46:55,879 --> 03:47:13,270

1439
03:48:47,700 --> 03:48:52,629
news the association of victims of adverse crimes announced that 80 percent of fixed rain tech

1440
03:48:52,709 --> 03:48:56,549
files have been restored the official said they might start the fixed rain as early as this

1441
03:48:56,549 --> 03:49:04,440
weekend that's too early this weekend what first ever person accused of adverse crime hawn huang

1442
03:49:04,440 --> 03:49:11,219
started a new life by becoming an artist i'd like a new start too huang stated someone claimed that

1443
03:49:11,219 --> 03:49:18,459
i exploited chippies but chippies were my friends adding chippies will be the main theme of my work

1444
03:49:18,459 --> 03:49:24,600
and i guess huang's occupation has now changed last up the recycling committee has announced

1445
03:49:24,600 --> 03:49:29,260
that this week's target material is plastic citizens who actively participate in plastic

1454

1555
04:09:52,069 --> 04:10:00,059
appraise things the last time i tried to not fully appraise something the lady said you didn't fully

1556
04:10:00,059 --> 04:10:10,659
appraise it why not and i had to fully appraise it anyways like can i actually do that some

1557
04:10:10,659 --> 04:10:21,020
customers just are just dicks you have to fully appraise for your reputation you can't buy

1558
04:10:21,579 --> 04:10:38,629
sometimes they don't notice all right i'm gonna let's start i have 550 bucks it's a mere celebrity

1559
04:10:38,629 --> 04:11:03,059
well i don't want to make the price more expensive i'm gonna do 500 would you please make me this

1560
04:11:03,059 --> 04:11:10,469
thing deserves more of your attention well i don't want to fully appraise it because i won't be able

1561
04:11:10,469 --> 04:11:21,850
to afford it why did i pay the loan back that was the worst decision i've made the entire game

1562
04:11:21,850 --> 04:11:29,500
uh make sure that i can get at least one of the two items what does he want he wanted um what

on the black list chloe came back wishing i'd give him an id card and i did and i paid some

1607
04:20:00,579 --> 04:20:12,389
interest what levels of gamer neck are there there's uh shaggy is considered pretty pretty

1608
04:20:12,389 --> 04:20:19,399
mild and it goes all the way to dark crystal skexy so there's a spectrum there somewhere in

1609
04:20:19,399 --> 04:20:33,819
the middle you know what there's four types of loafers in this world good loafer bad loafer rich

1610
04:20:33,819 --> 04:20:56,090
loafer mindless loafer which type are you all right where am i on the gamer neck spectrum um

1611
04:20:56,090 --> 04:21:01,399
i don't know i mean i feel like if you have a gamer neck and you have a big adam's apple

1612
04:21:01,399 --> 04:21:06,940
like it's like a you could double whammy i have a pretty big adam's apple so like it looks like i

1613
04:21:06,940 --> 04:21:26,250
kind of look like a turkey sometimes show yourself well hold on am i decent i'm decent uh so if you

1614
04:21:26,250 --> 04:21:39,239
see what i'm talking about here this so i feel like my adam's apple like is pretty big up here

1615
04:21:40,620 --> 04:21:45,739
so if the adam's apple is large then you end up like a scenario like this right with this juts

1616
04:21:45,739 --> 04:21:50,139
out far and if you have your neck kind of cocked like this it looks kind of like you have like a

1617
04:21:50,139 --> 04:21:56,629
gobbler here you know big my adam's apple areas that's how i'm able to go like this

1618
04:22:01,129 --> 04:22:12,360
yeah i got a big adam's apple and big vocal uh whatever they are that's how i'm able to do that

1619
04:22:16,139 --> 04:22:25,590
car noise it's like green green green

1620
04:22:26,229 --> 04:22:42,739

that job i wanted to ask if you'd like to sell umbrellas to me not avac i just don't like to see

1673
04:32:35,129 --> 04:32:41,139
people blindly obey orders i want to show avac that we're not just their puppets if i don't avac

1674
04:32:41,139 --> 04:32:47,590
will never give up on stepping on us don't worry about getting caught by the way i won't use the

umbrellas nor talk about anything that happened between us and i can pay you 150 bucks for each

1676
04:32:53,540 --> 04:33:04,869

1677
04:33:04,869 --> 04:33:17,830

1678
04:33:17,830 --> 04:33:25,380
think it's worth it this could be an avac user this is a fixer yeah i don't know not gonna happen

1679
04:33:25,380 --> 04:33:32,729
you can't trust anybody are you afraid to disobey now i'm afraid to like give what is absolutely

1680
04:33:32,729 --> 04:33:41,110
you are avac i don't want to like you're gonna turn me in that was way too much money for that

1683
04:34:06,060 --> 04:34:17,400
yes it was it was appraised for a thousand dollars leap you know professor choy you know that idiot

1684
04:34:17,400 --> 04:34:21,880
that guy doing a one-man protest and causing a ruckus i wanted to see what his living conditions

1685
04:34:21,880 --> 04:34:26,819
were like so i went to his house and the security was so bad i found this was just lying on the

1686
04:34:26,819 --> 04:34:35,450
ground oh wait is that thing a long time ago choy was talking about a time machine or time

1687
04:34:35,450 --> 04:34:40,729
capsule or something he boasted about how he made a machine that looked good let me read it i wanted

1688
04:34:40,729 --> 04:34:46,069
to use it so i stole it but i can't figure out how to use it for the life of me so i'm just going

1689
04:34:46,069 --> 04:34:55,319
to sell it for a low price okay oh let's see it's in uh so i just like who cares and just buy it

1690
04:34:55,319 --> 04:35:06,340
because he just wants it he sure is real the world's fastest travel with professor choy

1691
04:35:07,220 --> 04:35:13,689
yeah that's that's correct yeah i'm just gonna buy it i don't want to i'm not gonna tell you

1692
04:35:13,689 --> 04:35:27,880
what it's worth this is he just wants it i'll give you 120 bucks for it yeah i don't want to

1693
04:35:27,880 --> 04:35:34,500
i don't want to appraise it but like i have to appraise sometimes it's kind of confusing

1694
04:35:34,500 --> 04:35:44,650
how much is the masterpiece 2 000 i think must be wrong i'll buy it right away if it's 942

04:36:22,150 --> 04:36:26,650

1705
04:37:17,159 --> 04:37:34,020
well maybe that was my apartment movie script this is bad condition this is very bad um i would say

1706
04:37:34,020 --> 04:37:44,419
it's probably fairly damaged though though i don't think it's that brutal although let's see if it's

1707
04:37:44,419 --> 04:37:49,209
made out of what is it made out of paper yeah here's the kicker though when was this made

1708
04:37:49,209 --> 04:38:03,500
oh no this is not like all right 2076 significance and oh it's the sky it's like actor actor famous

1709
04:38:03,500 --> 04:38:18,490
for being a narcissist he is his script he just drew all over it okay well it's an artist where

1710
04:38:18,490 --> 04:38:27,689
is the celebrity type service uh it's signature of an artist and i know exactly who it is and

1711
04:38:27,770 --> 04:38:37,020
young people are gonna love it but at the end of the day it's still kind of rough around the edges

1712
04:38:37,020 --> 04:39:04,299
i'll give you 20 bucks for it 35 30 30 32 why do you keep calling the guy an artist it's triggering

1713

1834
05:01:44,459 --> 05:01:50,520
the week we announce our new plan last weekend the association stopped the resumption of fixed

1835
05:01:50,520 --> 05:01:56,020
rain however we are still deeply concerned that it will lead to more crimes therefore we'd like

1836
05:01:56,020 --> 05:02:01,610
to ask for your active cooperation in tracking down avarice criminals from this week from today

1837
05:02:02,090 --> 05:02:07,189
all citizens must cooperate to hunt down 90 avarice criminals each week by abiding by this

1838
05:02:07,189 --> 05:02:13,259
one rule agic city will be free from fixed range forever however if you fail for if you fail for

1839
05:02:13,259 --> 05:02:18,419
two consecutive weeks fixed rain will begin immediately they will we will distribute criminal

1840
05:02:18,419 --> 05:02:22,889
report button whenever you meet a person who is suspected to be an avarice criminal just press

1841
05:02:22,889 --> 05:02:29,590
the button if a citizen gets reported once they will receive pre-averice criminal badge if twice

1842
05:02:29,590 --> 05:02:34,040
they'll be judged as an avarice criminal who should pay a fine or get arrested you can check

1843
05:02:34,119 --> 05:02:38,200
the number of criminals searched out during the week in real time through the billboards in

1844
05:02:38,200 --> 05:02:42,659
fountain square names of excellent reporters and of places where avarice crimes are frequent will

1845
05:02:42,659 --> 05:02:49,580
also go public we're hoping for the day when agic city is reborn as an avarice crime safe city

1862
05:05:08,919 --> 05:05:14,360

nobody all right whatever i don't like i just sell fucking toys what if we never press it you'd

1864
05:05:21,959 --> 05:05:26,919
better not take it as an option for the city unless you make at least one or two reports every day

1865
05:05:26,919 --> 05:05:34,119
and we'll get hit with fixer show your responsibility as a citizen of agic city okay so i have to do it

1866
05:05:34,840 --> 05:05:52,709
okay mr i am from age of capital i'd like to tell you some sad news unfortunately age of capital

1867
05:05:52,709 --> 05:05:58,549
is terminating its domestic business soon and the fix ran comes if it does there will be no more

1868
05:05:58,549 --> 05:06:04,599
floaties to loan money to but before that happens i wanted you to know that you can take out an

1869
05:06:04,599 --> 05:06:13,880
emergency loan if you need one mister you should look onto it the guy from the simpsons have a

1870
05:06:13,880 --> 05:06:18,360
great day mister i don't need five thousand dollars right now i manage my money well

1871
05:06:19,000 --> 05:06:29,610
you can kindly leave i got the registration i did be the official manager of darcy's cool

1872
05:06:30,340 --> 05:06:35,669
by the way you got that report button i was going to give you something useful today but

1873
05:06:35,669 --> 05:06:40,310
i guess it might be too much for you now that uh we're being overburdened with that stupid button

1874
05:06:42,279 --> 05:06:47,380
life is full of challenges uh well yeah this might be a great chance for you to grow up

1875
05:06:47,380 --> 05:06:53,770
as you can see this is a vertivo hoverboard but let's say the customer who brought this

1876
05:06:53,770 --> 05:07:00,790
in doesn't know that you'd probably start thinking like if i share the card vertivo

1877
05:07:00,790 --> 05:07:06,009
the customer will surely expect more money but what if i don't share it that's what i asked

1878
05:07:06,009 --> 05:07:10,090
four hours ago however as you know the card allows you to put a higher price when you resell the

1879
05:07:10,090 --> 05:07:20,860
hoverboard exactly when the private slot should come to the front do you see the new piece of

1880
05:07:20,860 --> 05:07:25,770
equipment underneath the card slot try and find the card vertivo from the manual and put it in

1881
05:07:25,770 --> 05:07:34,659
the private slot did it really take them five hours of gameplay to get here to do this okay

1882
05:07:34,659 --> 05:07:56,200
well this is a brand vertivo okay you just successfully hid the card using the private

1883
05:07:56,200 --> 05:08:02,840
slot hiding information that you don't want to share but if you hide cards that have a

1884
05:08:02,840 --> 05:08:12,409
pricey information on it you might get a complaint or a nasty rumor okay you can hide up to two cards

1885
05:08:12,409 --> 05:08:18,389
cards here will be kept secret until you successfully buy the item and they go public as you display the

1886
05:08:18,389 --> 05:08:26,979
item okay i get it be careful if you use this too often customers are going to notice by the way

1887
05:08:26,979 --> 05:08:33,340
darcy is there any problem with your watch screwdriver oh about the screwdriver i got

1888
05:08:33,340 --> 05:08:39,220

1889
05:08:39,220 --> 05:08:44,180
mean you deserve to lose the screwdriver where did he learn all that torturing torturing skills

1890

05:10:34,389 --> 05:10:39,240

1903
05:10:39,240 --> 05:10:44,439

1904
05:10:44,439 --> 05:10:52,790
show you how to use it garcia used to separate gems by their surprisingness or unsurprising

1905
05:10:52,790 --> 05:11:03,880
gems all he wanted to know was just their kind it analyzes the kind and the quality of a gem

1906
05:11:03,880 --> 05:11:10,220
and then you get gem cards at sight it's a beautiful ruby ring and the price is

1907
05:11:10,220 --> 05:11:20,310
1050 now click the gem appraiser and move it onto the ring there's like a picture of it

1908
05:11:22,180 --> 05:11:30,700

1909
05:11:30,700 --> 05:11:36,299

1910
05:11:36,299 --> 05:11:42,490
can check a gem's actual name so don't forget to use it especially on accessories uh you forgot

1911
05:11:42,490 --> 05:11:48,330
to mention the card brand eraser you must check if it's if a gem is missing or broken when a

1912
05:11:48,330 --> 05:11:55,400
customer brings branded jewelry that's the case it cannot be classified into general accessories

1913
05:11:55,400 --> 05:12:01,740
such as necklaces and earrings its brand effect falls too there's a lot of info okay sure sure

1914
05:12:01,740 --> 05:12:06,060
now i remember that card the brand eraser in a situation like you said you can bring out the

1915
05:12:06,060 --> 05:12:11,819
card brand eraser to reduce the price fuck you game oh dear i have no idea what's happening in

1946
05:18:49,380 --> 05:18:54,900

they're all have them for the fixies you don't want this okay i you know what i you seem like

1950
05:19:34,860 --> 05:19:40,470
oh no no no i was giving it a second thought if i could trust your recommendation the truth is

1951
05:19:40,470 --> 05:19:45,020
i'm in graphological study club and the club holds meetings every monday so i thought i could rely

1952
05:19:45,020 --> 05:19:49,380
on you to get something with an autograph for today's meeting it occurred to me that your

1953
05:19:49,380 --> 05:19:54,139
recommendation may not be satisfying to me if your recommendation turns out to be reliable i'll come

1954
05:19:54,139 --> 05:20:26,020
back get all this shit out of the window somebody buy this bracelet uh sell the hoverboard for 200

1955
05:20:26,020 --> 05:20:41,159
and then okay i want i need to get rid of these paintings it's not really fancy but that doesn't

1956
05:20:41,159 --> 05:20:55,060
mean you can't buy it right this is by uh buzz fly it is actually this is this is very damaged

1957
05:20:55,060 --> 05:21:04,060
that's nitpicky no it's not it's very it's clearly damaged what's what is made out of

1958
05:21:04,060 --> 05:21:16,900
carbon fiber you got that right wing it fuzz flies 2076 insignificant there and signature on it okay

1959
05:21:16,900 --> 05:21:35,479
what about fuzz fly okay mr brand's fuzz fly where's fuzz fly all right oh no this is wrong

1960
05:21:35,479 --> 05:21:41,720
this is made out of carbon fiber no it is carbon fiber never mind okay once middle zian hoverboard

1961
05:21:41,720 --> 05:21:46,599
brand that lost its reputation after being sold to a corporate republic to avoid taxes

1962
05:21:46,599 --> 05:21:57,750
well sorry to say sorry about that uh wing it fuzz fly wing it fuzz fly that's accurate

1963
05:21:57,750 --> 05:22:03,000
this is actually from fuzz fly the only thing now that i have to determine is who signed this

1964
05:22:10,500 --> 05:22:14,889
you did once a business man but he later became the first person accused of an

1965
05:22:14,889 --> 05:22:19,450
adverse crime he was charged with using chippies to build wealth luxury but was some what was

1966
05:22:19,450 --> 05:22:29,580
acquitted okay so this is by an artist it's a fake signature how do you know that's real

1967
05:22:30,139 --> 05:22:45,349
this is a real city what are you talking about oh shit the top right report that person um yeah

1974
05:24:07,580 --> 05:24:15,319
stainless steel ring this is a platinum ring that's a platinum ring my friend i am the judge yeah it's

1975
05:24:15,319 --> 05:24:22,330
worth a lot more than you think it is let's see if we got anything else significant on here

1976
05:24:22,330 --> 05:24:31,130
fixer 1.0 and okay what about uh anybody sign this ring no it's a really nice ring it's a very very

1977
05:24:31,130 --> 05:24:38,250
nice ring and he had it wrong it was actually platinum so i mean like you're gonna get more

1978
05:24:38,250 --> 05:24:43,979
than you thought you're gonna get more than you thought what i can get for you here i'd say

1979
05:24:43,979 --> 05:25:01,770
somewhere around 1500 but i could probably do 1200 that's all my money it's a good a thousand

1980
05:25:01,770 --> 05:25:18,540
great get that shit right up there immediately for four grand for you just like what i expected

2121
05:49:12,090 --> 05:49:22,409
it whoa were you aware of it too that the avca was targeting me i wish you could understand what

2122
05:49:22,409 --> 05:49:31,080
it's like to live his own gmo and you might understand living as a huge star is never easy

2123
05:49:31,080 --> 05:49:36,680
my guess avac hates me not because i'm against fixer because i'm too popular must be that they

2124
05:49:36,680 --> 05:49:42,599
want to arrest me to fix me and take me away all the love and popularity i will never let

2125
05:49:42,599 --> 05:49:47,400
that happen because my fans love and attention are what i live for as you know when fixed rain

2126
05:49:47,400 --> 05:49:54,220
comes there will be no one left to love me which means there will be no more reason for me to be

2127
05:49:54,220 --> 05:50:02,569
alive but you won't even bother to think that way once you get fixed oh i did try to imagine my life

2128
05:50:02,569 --> 05:50:11,779
as a fixie and it might be easier than my current life i don't know everything to sell human nature

2129
05:50:11,779 --> 05:50:16,299
my fame popularity natural born talent and the love i'm receiving and what

2130
05:50:16,299 --> 05:50:25,299
belonged to me i can't let either avac or fixer take those from me you get what i'm saying you

2131
05:50:25,299 --> 05:50:30,549
don't that's still not your fault anyway don't forget to drink some warm milk before bed since

2132
05:50:30,549 --> 05:50:37,209

2296
06:20:09,400 --> 06:20:14,790
take one hour or 12 depending how much you dig around why don't you speak up streaming the week

2297
06:20:15,509 --> 06:20:22,500
uh i'll explain this for a lot of the new people here so i used to do like four days a week i

2298
06:20:22,500 --> 06:20:28,970
streamed like oh tuesday thursday friday and like sunday right i do like three four days a week

2299
06:20:28,970 --> 06:20:33,369
uh but i ran through an annoying medical problem that made it so it was hard to sit down or stand

2300
06:20:33,369 --> 06:20:37,900
or even the same place for more than three four five six hours of time and it was actually causing

2301
06:20:37,900 --> 06:20:46,180
me a lot of problems um i dialed back my streams because it was physically painful to just like

2302
06:20:46,180 --> 06:20:54,099
kind of sit here or stand i tried kind of it's difficult so i pulled the streams back and since

2303
06:20:54,099 --> 06:20:58,790
doing that i've actually felt a little better i'm able to kind of move around i'm able to do some

2304
06:20:58,790 --> 06:21:02,630
more things and it gives me more time to work on the big projects that i really want to work on

2305
06:21:02,630 --> 06:21:10,630
so it's kind of a win-win in a way streaming less means i feel a bit better and way more interesting

2306
06:21:10,630 --> 06:21:17,189
kind of projects can be worked on too at the same time gives me more time but if i'm able to and

2307
06:21:17,189 --> 06:21:23,130
that's why a weekend andy makes the most sense because streaming like saturday all right you're

2308
06:21:23,130 --> 06:21:26,330
gonna see me on saturday and i'll see you next saturday or like hey i'll see you saturday and

2309
06:21:26,330 --> 06:21:31,959
sunday right that's easy so doing weekday streams is always kind of like well which what day do i

2310
06:21:31,959 --> 06:21:38,389
pick i guess i'll just do it on tuesday or i guess i'll do it on friday right having those set in

2311
06:21:38,389 --> 06:21:43,139
stone it's gonna be like friday saturday or sunday makes it a little easier to kind of plan what i

2312
06:21:43,139 --> 06:21:49,060
want to do uh but i'm not against streaming more but i don't want to do what i was doing before

2313
06:21:49,380 --> 06:21:56,970
so it's going to be very rare to see more than two streams a week on this channel and sometimes it

2314
06:21:56,970 --> 06:22:01,400
might be one i don't want to fuck around with this because i've been feeling a little bit better

2315
06:22:01,400 --> 06:22:07,240
and one of the big contributors has been i'm not sitting in this chair for like eight hours four or

2316
06:22:07,240 --> 06:22:11,299
five days a week because my streams used to be way longer too i used to i used to sit here till

2317
06:22:11,299 --> 06:22:16,540
at least it was like my stream average was like seven and a half to eight and a half hours

2318
06:22:16,540 --> 06:22:26,180
so i really want to keep myself honest here and do that kind of explains why but it look if i feel

2319
06:22:26,180 --> 06:22:29,779
like i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it it's never a guarantee but we'll see so i think we can do

2320
06:22:29,779 --> 06:22:42,860
this next weekend simpson's hit and run imagine you're a streamer and you develop anti-streamer

2321
06:22:42,860 --> 06:22:57,020
disease i mean sometimes it feels like that i'll be honest anti-streamer disease uh yeah so all

2322
06:22:57,020 --> 06:23:02,299
right i'll see you guys next weekend we'll call it here i think it's a good place to do it thanks

2323
06:23:02,299 --> 06:23:08,709
for watching as always i'm gonna go get some food because i don't want to go too much longer if there

2324
06:23:08,709 --> 06:23:13,930
really is another like four to five hours left in this game i kind of want to see the end i feel

2325
06:23:13,930 --> 06:23:19,479
like we're invested at this point and again my only complaint of this game is i wish i could

2326
06:23:20,119 --> 06:23:25,479
not have it go through the text before i press the button that's okay that's one of the only

2327
06:23:25,479 --> 06:23:36,779
complaints uh but i'll see you on let's go with uh friday friday we're gonna do sims mod hell

2328
06:23:36,779 --> 06:23:41,900
saturday we're gonna do delta rune and possibly this if delta rune takes a long time then maybe

2329
06:23:41,900 --> 06:23:49,259
you'll see a stream on monday we'll see i will see you next week oh sunday sorry i'll see you

2330
06:23:49,259 --> 06:24:08,650

2331
06:24:08,650 --> 06:24:21,270

2332
06:24:21,270 --> 06:24:29,669
there's a lot of other things we can do i have a list of games to play after next weekend there's

2333
06:24:29,669 --> 06:24:37,900
probably going to be a couple of pre-stream polls so those will come back because i have a lot of

2334
06:24:37,900 --> 06:24:46,459
options and i'm not sure which ones to do do any one of them to be honest and that's right it's

2335
06:24:46,459 --> 06:24:58,330
