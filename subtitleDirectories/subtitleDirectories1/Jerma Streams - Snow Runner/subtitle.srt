1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:11,449
Yeah, you can just call me on time, Andy. How's my mic? Sound bad? I'm playing around with

2
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:20,920
settings. I think it sounds fine. That's good. All right. Hello, everybody. How are you? Let me

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:41,079
tweet. Let me tweet first. Tweet has been out. Very good. Thought you were playing hard time.

4
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:50,380
Yeah, I was. I was until I wasn't. So here's why I'm not playing hard time. M Dickie has

5
00:00:51,880 --> 00:01:01,829
two or three iPad, Android exclusive mobile games. So I'm like, there's a superhero one.

6
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:07,719
There's one where you pick a superhero and it's M Dickie superhero world. So I was like, you know

7
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:17,780
what? Why don't we just like do it a day where I just play all the M Dickie iPad games? And then

8
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,780
I was told that there's like three versions of hard time and like one of them is the one to play

9
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,810
or something. So I was like, you know what? Let me I'll figure that out. In the meantime,

10
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:37,879
this is a highly requested game. Diablo two waiting room. You've got you've got like a month

11
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:47,530
to wait for that. And I'm not going to stream Diablo two. I don't even know if I'm going to play

12
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:57,189
Diablo two. Like I don't you know what I mean? Like I have no idea. When's the next Sims stream?

13
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:04,659
Well, I have all the mods. I just didn't want it to be like dollhouse Sims three. I'm the Sims guy.

14
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:09,830
Come on back from the dollhouse and check out the Sims three. So like, you know what? Well,

15
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:19,580
I have a bunch of fucked up mods. We'll play with it some other time. Maybe like next week

16
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:25,930
or something. So here's how this is going to go. Okay. Today, we're going to play snow runner.

17
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:32,729
And I heard it's quite a rage game. You better be ready for that one. You drive around in big

18
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:41,689
trucks and have to deliver stuff. And you have to be careful. The meltdown. I don't know if I don't

19
00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:46,180
it's not possible for a meltdown. I don't have the brain power to do a meltdown right now.

20
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:54,229
No way. Even if I wanted to get really angry, it would just hit a wall and I'd be like, what the

21
00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:00,280
fuck? I'm just like, so I'm still kind of coming down from the dollhouse. Even though it was like

22
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:06,229
a week ago, I'm coming off like the high of the dollhouse week. So I figured we'll just

23
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:12,710
chill today. No more heroes. Three is out too, by the way. So we're going to do that this coming

24
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:22,680
weekend. I heard it's long too. No more heroes. Three is like 17, 15, 16 hours long. The first

25
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:35,979
two were like 11 hours, 10 hours. It's a longer game. This game is going to lay waste to your

26
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:48,199
attention span. Is it? Is it a hard game? LOL. Do you do drugs? I mean, if you count a seed of

27
00:03:48,199 --> 00:04:04,840
medicine, ibuprofen sometimes. No, I'm not high right now. I'm not. Although I've told you this

28
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:11,990
before, but it is a great excuse. Anytime I do something stupid. Ah, it's, it's because he's

29
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:19,589
high today. Yep. Yeah, sure. That's why I can't add six and four in less than 10 seconds. Yeah,

30
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:23,670
I can't do eight plus seven because I just got high today. You know, you guys are right.

31
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:31,420
So it's a great thing to fall back on for sure. All right, let's go. Did I tweet this? Yeah.

32
00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:41,269
Welcome back. We're going back to normal. We're kind of closing the book on the last week of

33
00:04:41,269 --> 00:04:49,350
insanity onto the next one. There's already plans on the next two larger streams. I'm very excited

34
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,399
and we're just going to do them. If they're fun, then I'm going to try to do them.

35
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:59,430
There will be more details on those soon. And also I want to make this clear. Grotto beasts

36
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:09,620
is not just gone. Grotto beast is here. It'll be here. You'll be able to buy it before the end

37
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,829
of the year. We're really hoping that somewhere on Christmas time, like the November, December

38
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:21,220
space, I want you guys to be able to get your hands on those. And now that all the dollhouse

39
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:26,180
stuff is done, the months of that, all that work, we're going to focus on some of the smaller

40
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:33,060
projects that aren't huge, gigantic streams and Grotto beast and the German craft server are the

41
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:38,680
next kind of coming up in line. So let's play snow runner. Let's just do it. I came on. I hope

42
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:52,120
not. When is baseball? Baseball is going to be, hopefully if it's not by the end of October of

43
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:59,110
this year, just whether you can't really play baseball like November, December, it's just not

44
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:04,980
possible. Let's go to like a dome, but I don't think we're going to go to a dome. If it's not

45
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:09,769
October, end of October this year, then that's the first thing that'll happen around like the

46
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:22,040
spring training time, February, March, hopefully of 2022. What is baseball though? Something that

47
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:28,220
I've wanted to do for over a year that was ready to go a year ago and COVID fucked the whole thing

48
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:34,970
up. So it's just done and it's ready, but I can't do it. Well, it's not done, but you know what I

49
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:41,829
mean? All right, snow runner. Am I going to, am I going to fucking hate this game? I don't know.

50
00:06:41,829 --> 00:06:48,709
We're going to find out. Let me turn it up. I'm not going to play it on hard mode. By the way,

51
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:55,399
I got a 30 90. So, uh, this should look really good. Like only the second or third game I played

52
00:06:55,399 --> 00:07:07,060
on this 30 90. All right, let's go. New campaign plot one. This guy's rich. He has a 30 90. No,

53
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:12,300
this guy's got a 30 90. Cause he had to pay like a hundred percent ultra premium to make a new

54
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:17,509
computer. Don't think that like, Oh wow. That's cool. No, I got like scammed. Cause I bought like

55
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:24,339
50 fucking percent over market price. Like that's not cool. Like that's, that's stupid. I did a dumb,

56
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:30,329
stupid idiot thing. Thank you for joining our recovery and maintenance effort after the

57
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:36,089
devastating flood. We need all help available to repair the bridge that collapsed. It's our only

58
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:45,579
link to the other side of the river. Disposable income, Andy. Stop it. Hey, there's a lot of new

59
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:53,050
people here. Okay. We got to like, I'm Jerma and I'm cool. First need to find a watch tower to get

60
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:59,620
a view of your surroundings. All right. I need to find a watch tower and you'll have to find a truck

61
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:05,560
capable of transport. Is this like a, do I walk around as a human? You have to find a truck capable

62
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,639
of transporting the materials need to repair the bridge. After the bridge is repaired, you will be

63
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:19,750
able to reach your first garage. Find a watch tower, find a truck. I was going to say, what the

64
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:25,209
hell is that? Oh shit. Plus one letter grade automatically. All right. Remove handbrake.

65
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:34,039
Start engine. Your first move should always be to scout new areas. Open the map. Your tracked

66
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:42,860
objective always shows up here. Let's go find that watch tower. Uh, okay. Is there a straight line?

67
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:50,940
It's already an F. You can't give a game an F before I've even hit the accelerate button. Okay.

68
00:08:54,309 --> 00:09:02,570
We're in Michigan, Alaska, Tamir, Kola Peninsula, and Yukon. All right. So these are different

69
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:11,990
areas. So we're in the flooded foothills. Big Salmon Peak. All right. Whatever. Except that

70
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:20,419
we're in the flooded foothills, right? Oh shit. All right. So here's a watch tower right here.

71
00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:27,990
All right. So can I just put a waypoint on it? Did you pirate the game? This game is on Steam.

72
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:34,419
What do you mean did I pirate the game? This game is available on Steam. I got it on Steam.

73
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:42,039
I wouldn't even pirate the game. Okay. In order to access this region, find a garage. Why can I

74
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:46,870
keep thinking of like the English way to say that word? A garage. A garage, right? I don't know why

75
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:54,629
I keep it just to say garage. Don't do like the English way. Please travel to Alaska. No. All

76
00:09:54,629 --> 00:10:08,070
right. Well, what do I do? All right. Find a watch tower. How do I drive? Oh, why would the handbrake

77
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:22,090
be on? All right. Hold on. I got too much of mud. I wouldn't want to drive through this. When driving

78
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:26,330
on rough terrain, you can switch to low gear. It'll slow you down, but will lower the risk of

79
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:33,879
getting stuck. Okay. So low gear. It makes me, I won't get stuck. LB and press R to the left to

80
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:44,309
activate. All right. Low gear. I won't get stuck in the mud. I already lost. No, I didn't lose.

81
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:54,220
Your truck is all wheel drive capable. The AWD will also help in tough terrain, but will increase

82
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:59,960
your fuel consumption. Oh, should I have fuel? Hold LB and X to activate all wheel drive.

83
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:07,750
I don't need it right now. You should get off low gear when you're on a normal terrain.

84
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:17,399
This is not normal terrain. All right. All wheel drive. Let's go. Oh, there's just a guy in here.

85
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:27,690
I like that. Plus 0.5 letter grade. How is this normal terrain? It's not. All right. Turn off

86
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:38,220
all wheel drive. This only happens in the pirated version. I bought this game. I own this game.

87
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:49,370
Okay. Old people will be driving circles around you. It's raining in the mud. You guys have no,

88
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:57,379
you just don't know anything about like all wheel drive or anything. Guess what? I don't know

89
00:11:57,379 --> 00:12:06,779
anything about all wheel drive either. I drive a Honda Civic. All right. Should I take off the,

90
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:13,509
let's take this off. How do I change that again? How do I change the gear? I want to go back to

91
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:26,409
normal gear. Let's hold LB and there it is. Okay. A, auto. Wait, no. How do I? No, that's

92
00:12:26,409 --> 00:12:34,169
all right. Yeah, that's fine. Oh shit. No, stay in low. Oops. All right. I got to go all wheel

93
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:39,559
drive. If you're stuck, you can try using your winch and see if there's anything around that

94
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:46,100
you can attach it to. Activate the functions menu with up to use your winch. I'm not stuck.

95
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:56,970
All right. How do I do all wheel drive again? All wheel drive. How do I do all wheel drive?

96
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:02,889
It was right bumper and something else, right? What was it? An X, right? Okay. There it is. Let's

97
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:12,840
go. I'm not stuck. Fuck out of here. Why am I just driving the grass? Why am I driving on the road?

98
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:26,039
This thing is so dirty. This is too low of a truck. You're going to get stuck. I'm fine. I think I

99
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:36,019
would be fine. I would never do this drive. All right. Turn off all wheel drive. Good.

100
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:45,690
Here we go. There's a road right here. Take it off low. There's no need. All right. Well, I'm

101
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:48,730
about, I'm about, here's a road right here. All right. Find a watch tower. All right. We're back

102
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:58,779
on. We're on the road. What's nitro? All right. This drives way, way different than I thought it

103
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:03,740
was going to be on the road. Sit the brakes. All right. Hold on. Can you die? Okay. I don't

104
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:08,149
get you die in this game. All right. There's a, what should I go left? Should I go right?

105
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:22,200
No, fuck that. We're going on the road. How do I activate the rockets? Did I put in an all wheel

106
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,120
drive and just fucking hit the gas as hard as I can? Oh, I've been playing for like 10 minutes.

107
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:43,450
All right. I'll do it one time. You will encounter different kinds of terrains such as road, dirt,

108
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:50,950
mud, deep mud, water, rocky slides, snow and ice. Only the most experienced drivers with well-equipped

109
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:55,750
vehicles can drive on any kind of terrain. When in doubt, there's no shame in avoiding danger.

110
00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:00,389
You can find out more about the different types of terrain in the codex. All right. So

111
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:18,470
can I just drive through this? Can I, can I drive through this? Yeah. All right. Well,

112
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:29,259
I'll just do this way. How high is this water? Is the water too high? All right. Should I put

113
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:33,100
in an all wheel drive? I don't know what to do. What are you supposed to do in this scenario?

114
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,019
All right. I'm going to drive as fast as I can over this. I'm going all wheel drive. I'm putting

115
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:48,970
on the boosters and I'm just going to hit the gas. All right. Let's go. I've played the Oregon trail.

116
00:15:48,970 --> 00:16:03,830
I'll make it. It's okay. Jerry got typhoid fever. Who cares? He was dying anyways.

117
00:16:05,259 --> 00:16:14,809
You can refuel here or near any vehicle that may. Okay. So how much gas? How much money do I have?

118
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:26,309
If I drive into these things, they explode. If I drive into them, fuel three gallons. Okay. How

119
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:35,269
much does that cost? Find out. No, but there's like, I don't want to, what is, how's the game

120
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:43,340
saved? How do I change that camera angle? I don't want to use the winch. Your winch should be

121
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:47,899
connected to a solid object. It's like the winch point on your vehicle and which point to an object

122
00:16:47,899 --> 00:17:12,339
in your surroundings. Wait, what? Okay. Um, hold on. All right. Attach winch here and then select

123
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:24,039
the winch point. Oh, wait, what does it attach to? No, I wanted to attach it. I want to put the winch

124
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:35,690
over here. Show damage. Oh, I'm fine. I got to pull everything. Can I attach it to this? All right.

125
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:45,579
Attach winch. Put it on the back and select the point. Oh, I see. Okay. You can't do it.

126
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:51,829
Well, let's just, okay. First, why to pull your winch? Try using your own engine power to pull

127
00:17:51,829 --> 00:18:16,460
yourself. What if I just drive away? No, I'm trying to rip the fucking sign down. All right. Well,

128
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:29,960
I can't do that. Honk? How do you honk? Okay. All right. I tried to do it. I'm just going to drive.

129
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,960
Open the function window to get more details about damaged parts. What did I just do?

130
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:47,339
What's my damage? Oh, put the winch down. Delete trailer. Stop engine. Recover. How do I see the

131
00:18:47,339 --> 00:19:03,559
damage? All right. Well, fucking whatever. I'm fine. Let's go. Where's the tower? Wait, hold on.

132
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:16,039
I have the map, right? Oh, fuck yeah. Let's just drive through the trees. This is an off-road game.

133
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:26,819
You're not supposed to play by the rules. It's an all-wheel drive. Just fucking drive through the

134
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:41,960
trees. I've done this in GTA a thousand times. Watch it. Note that watchtower ahead. Such icons

135
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:47,900
will help you detect objective zones nearby. There we go. Look at that. That was simple.

136
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:53,509
I did it. Good job. You discovered your first watchtower. Discovering watchtowers will reveal

137
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:58,220
parts of the map. To repair the bridge, you need a bigger vehicle to transport materials.

138
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:05,799
Okay. Open your map. Look at your surroundings. Find a truck capable of transporting the materials

139
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:11,559
needed. Okay. So I got to find a truck, a big truck, capable of transporting shit. All right.

140
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:24,069
It's just Ubisoft. Yeah, it is. Even the menu looks like Ubisoft. This is way more elaborate

141
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:27,829
than I thought it was going to be. By the way, I thought those were guns on the left side.

142
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:33,609
Discovering watchtowers will reveal part of the map. The fog covers essential points of interest

143
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:39,289
like objectives, upgrades, and vehicles. By pressing right trigger, you can place markers

144
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:43,450
on your map to help you navigate. You can delete the last marker with left trigger or clear your

145
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:48,759
route by holding left trigger. Plan a route now. Well, we're going to go to the truck, right?

146
00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:57,980
Acecam? Nah, maybe if you're good. Maybe if you're good. All right. Let's do a route.

147
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:05,720
There's a lumber mill. What's over here? Sideboard trailer. And there's a truck.

148
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:13,049
Let's go get the truck. It just drives straight line. It's not even helping me.

149
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:25,500
Okay. Well, whatever. I'm going that way. How close can I get? Is there a first person camera?

150
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:52,890
Is there a save game? What if this hurts? What happened? Am I already stuck? Do I feel rage yet?

151
00:21:52,890 --> 00:22:09,160
Not really. All right. Get in an all-wheel drive. Let's go. I don't want the camera. The camera's

152
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:19,829
moving on in far, big, terrible places. Here we go. I'm good. That's deep mud, but I'm fine.

153
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:32,339
I got to turn off like the smart camera or whatever the hell this is. You're actually

154
00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:37,220
pretty good at this game. Well, I mean, it's the first level. Just wait till I get the

155
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:45,059
Mack truck. All right. Now let's turn this way and just drive straight. Perfect. I don't need a

156
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:57,670
route. I have plenty of gas too. I'm an all-wheel drive. All right. Get off this. Let's go. Don't

157
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:09,299
crash into any trees. I'll be fine. Vehicle damage. What? You may repair your vehicle in the garage

158
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:14,980
or use special service add-ons and trailers. Find details about the- What? You found your first

159
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:19,619
highway truck. This truck is designed for roads, so there are no off-road options included.

160
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:31,700
Try not to fall into the swamp or drive into deep mud. Fall into the swamp? How would I fall into

161
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:37,640
the swamp if I'm just driving on the road? Okay. You can find out more about the different type

162
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:54,500
of trucks in this codex. All right. Well, let's get it. What's going on? Am I hitting this picnic

163
00:23:54,500 --> 00:24:08,900
table? Oh shit. I'm like buried in here. All right. Turn on all wheel drive. Slowly try to get out of

164
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:15,220
this mud. Mud actually breaks apart physics underneath you. That's crazy. Why can I not go

165
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:25,059
through this? I'm just digging myself a hole. Where'd it go? I can't reverse. Why can I not

166
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:43,910
reverse? Can I get out of the car? Okay. I'm going to have to tow it. Okay. Winch. Let's attach the

167
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:54,970
front to this truck here. All right. Let's go. Nice. Yes. All right. I'm good. Take it off.

168
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,740
How would I still be stuck right here? This is stupid. Don't hit the explosive barrel.

169
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:09,079
I don't want to fuck that up. All right. Well, come on. Just drive.

170
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:20,630
All right. All right. I got it. I got it. I got it. Now what?

171
00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:29,059
That was just the that was just the every commercial break of return for pawn stars.

172
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:36,680
I don't know what you're saying, Chumlee. No, no, no, no, no. I don't think any of you idiots know

173
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:42,730
what you're doing in here. Pops. Pops. We got this new thing. I don't care about that shit. Get that

174
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:57,259
out of my store. Fucking idiot. Change the truck. All right. Well, how do I get in it? That was just

175
00:25:57,259 --> 00:26:07,420
Mitch McConnell. All right. How about a change truck? Oh shit. All right. Wait. I can't. Can I

176
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:12,730
save that truck somewhere? I don't want to drive this thing. Didn't they just say that this thing

177
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:21,640
doesn't do off-road? All right. I need a new destination. Lumber mill. What's my what is my

178
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:29,670
actual goal? Old bridge reconstruction. Okay. I need to deliver two wooden planks. So we're

179
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:38,279
going to get this one to the lumber mill. It does off-road if you push it down and hit the gas hard

180
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:50,519
enough while screaming. All right. I need metal beams and wooden plier. Let's do the wood. Let's

181
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:56,900
get the wooden planks. It's definitely here. To complete this contract, you need to do two

182
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:04,309
objectives. They must be done in order. What? What are you talking about? They'd be done in order.

183
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:13,460
The one in the town is the storage facility. This is storage. Will you be able to pick up the

184
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:18,180
required cargo? The marker near the broken bridge indicates the delivery location. Let's go check

185
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:24,410
out the town storage. What do you mean go to the fucking town storage? I don't want to go to the

186
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:32,599
town storage. I want to go to the lumber mill because that's where the wood is. Okay. We're

187
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:44,390
going to go here. You have to do it in order. That's I don't like that. Let's go. I have to repair the

188
00:27:44,390 --> 00:28:08,920
bridge. This truck is able to transport two slots of cargo. All right. Wait, this is much closer

189
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:16,230
than I thought it was. Can I just get it? I don't why do I have to do it in order? I shouldn't have

190
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:21,190
to do it in order. I'm not doing it in order. It's right here. Do the first do it in order.

191
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:25,769
Well, I don't want to do it in order. It's right here. This lumber is literally five

192
00:28:25,769 --> 00:28:48,200
millimeters away from me. Wait, why is it? This thing is too big. All right. I'll go this way.

193
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:57,369
But the order. But the order. I'm going. All right. How much gas do I have? All right. Get this shit

194
00:28:57,369 --> 00:29:13,829
in all wheel drive. Wait, there's no all wheel drive. There isn't? This is so scary. It's got,

195
00:29:13,829 --> 00:29:25,509
it already has all wheel drive, doesn't it? All right. Slow down. Don't be an idiot.

196
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:33,690
It is safe. All right. Auto saves. That's good. All right. Metal beams and then two pieces of wood.

197
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:42,740
This guy loves yard work and big trucks. I do. It's all right. I can run over some stuff in this

198
00:29:42,740 --> 00:30:06,710
like PUBG neighborhood. I'll be fine. Easy. Hey, look, they put like hazards. Oh no. I thought

199
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:19,619
that was a hole. Oh wait. Look at this. Can I drive this car? Can I change truck? Oh, come on.

200
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:34,359
I can't drive this. I can't drive the SUV. Why not? Everyone is dead. No, I think I don't know.

201
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:42,359
All right. I need to put in two pieces of metal. Cargo management. There are a couple of ways to

202
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:47,000
load a selected cargo. Automatic loading provides a simple and fast way of loading without the use

203
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:55,509
of a crane. All right. Easy. That's good. All right. So how many metal beams? Load it up.

204
00:30:56,230 --> 00:31:02,279
Not enough space. All right. Well, I have enough. Cool. All right. So now I'm going to bring this.

205
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:16,549
Where am I bringing this? I have to bring this to the bridge. Where's the bridge? Fuel station

206
00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:31,720
lumber mill. Would they go here? I have to bring it here. All right. Get this off. It's on the map.

207
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:40,630
Oh, shit. Okay. It's this one. That's so far away. Holy shit. That's so far away. Okay. Well,

208
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:54,569
whatever. All right. I'm bringing it to the bridge. Just drive on the highway. You may attach trailers

209
00:31:54,569 --> 00:31:59,369
found out in the wilds and use them to your liking. Trailer attachments done. Wait a minute.

210
00:31:59,369 --> 00:32:06,970
You may be unable to attach a variety of trailers just for a reason between distance, angle. Okay.

211
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:14,680
Wait a minute. So hold on. Should I get the trailer and go get the wood? Oh, shit. All right. Yeah.

212
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:27,190
That sounds like a good idea. All right. Where's the trailer? There it is. I need a gas station

213
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:38,500
too. What's already in here? All right. I got a new trailer. How am I going to put this on?

214
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:48,900
Can I pull it? Okay. I need to like get this. I need to move this. I'm going to try to move it.

215
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:05,480
Good. I actually wanted to dump it anyways. All right. So how do I, how do I take care of,

216
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:25,720
hold on. I need to flip it. I think I may have fucked this up bad. Come on. Pull it up. I need

217
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:39,880
to get it up on its legs. All right. Here we go. How do I get it up? Okay. So now I'm going to

218
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:59,720
attach the trailer. Attach trailer. Attach trailer. I can't. Okay. Attach trailer. No suitable

219
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:10,519
trailer. Can I like flip this? I have to flip it. I have to flip it. I have to go back on it.

220
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:17,719
I have to flip it. Got it. All right. Good, good, good. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

221
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:42,010
God damn it. I'm going to run a gas doing this. I actually flipped it. Attach to here. Let's go.

222
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:47,579
Flip it. Oh, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop,

223
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:55,190
stop. I'm good. I got it. I now attach this damn thing. See, we're fine. Everyone relax.

224
00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:04,739
Trailer attached. Go. Although, wait, this is going to be hard to do.

225
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:13,260
All right. I need, I need to get, should I get gas? I mean, what the hell am I doing? I'm going

226
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:20,070
to get lumber. All right. Now we're going to go to the lumber yard. Turn this off. This game's pretty

227
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:30,789
cool. I like this. This is fun. All right. Let's go get the lumber over here. This is fun. Well,

228
00:35:30,789 --> 00:35:42,260
I have to drive slow though, because I, I, I, it's pulling me in both directions. All right. Slow.

229
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:49,590
I got a big load here. You know, every time I ever saw somebody at an intersection, like a big truck,

230
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:55,130
take these turns, I always imagine like, oh, it's like, it's a red light or they have like a left

231
00:35:55,130 --> 00:36:00,219
arrow and here they are taking the turn. I always feel like the person in that car is just like

232
00:36:00,219 --> 00:36:23,079
pursing their lips going like, fuck, fuck, like screaming every time. And it doesn't, it always

233
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:30,440
kind of feel like that they're about to hit you too. Like I just, the truck just comes all the way

234
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,840
across. You're sitting there at the light and it just goes across your car. You're like, holy shit,

235
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:52,059
how can you do this? How is it possible that you can even, how? I'm almost at 700,000 followers.

236
00:36:53,449 --> 00:37:01,099
Holy shit. That's way more than I had like a month ago. Hey, thanks for the follows. Really

237
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:11,860
appreciate it. Thanks for joining the stream. Yeah, you, I'm talking to you. Thank you. All right.

238
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:22,260
Let's fill this up. I need two pieces of lumber. All right. Let's go. Wooden planks. I need two out

239
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:30,699
of two. Put them into the trailer. Load it up. One, two. All right. I'm good. I have a, this is

240
00:37:30,699 --> 00:37:38,019
really heavy now though. This could be a disaster. Um, all right. Hold on. Now look at this. I got a

241
00:37:38,019 --> 00:37:42,329
road right here. It's just a straightaway right here. Don't do anything stupid. Don't be like,

242
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:51,940
oh, look at this. And it's driving to the water. I know you want to. No, it says go that way.

243
00:37:52,659 --> 00:37:57,159
I'm not driving in the fucking water. I didn't know. No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

244
00:37:57,159 --> 00:38:02,820
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. I'm not going to fuck this up. We're going to do this the

245
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:16,519
right way. See? Okay. That's not the right. That's not what I was doing, but okay. All right. Pull

246
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:31,579
this back. I got to give myself a route. No, clear it. Clear. All right. No, this way. I'll get the,

247
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:36,230
I'll get the gist of it when I get here or whatever. Okay. There's the route. Let's do it.

248
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:56,889
When are you going to show us your disfigured face? How about now? All right. I'll give you a

249
00:38:56,889 --> 00:39:13,400
face cam for this part. That's it. No, I don't do face cam unless I have to. All right. Here we go.

250
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:24,809
Am I well lit? I can't, I don't know. I can't even tell. Ew. Hold on. I got to get, I got to

251
00:39:24,809 --> 00:39:41,860
get some like blood flow to my like eyes and cheeks. Okay. Okay. Be careful. See, this is why

252
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:45,510
I can't do face cam because I'm just like, what do I look like right now? What do I look like right

253
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:50,280
now? Oh, I have to play a game. What do I look like right now? No, I hate it. I don't, this

254
00:39:50,280 --> 00:40:12,679
distracts me. Oh shit. Okay. Hold on. I got, I think I have enough gas to do this first mission.

255
00:40:17,019 --> 00:40:27,860
Don't go too fast. I'm going to like flip this thing. Is that water? No. Can this stuff fall out

256
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:38,710
or is it attached? It looks like it's attached by the bungees or something. Stop looking. I got to

257
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:52,570
stop looking over here. Game just crashed. No, we're good. Okay. If you and I were in a fight,

258
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:59,269
like I pull out a knife and you pull out like a sword and we're like about to fight to the death.

259
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:05,429
Put the weapon down. Put it down. Just hold a mirror up. Like over here. Just hold up a mirror

260
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,869
and like you could, you could have like a fist or a knife in the other hand, whatever you want.

261
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:13,510
As long as there's a mirror here and we're like jumping around and dancing around, I'm going to

262
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:21,190
be like, ah, like, like fighting. What does it, what does it mean in the mirror? That's what it

263
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:31,079
looked like. That's how, that's my weakness. You'll win every single time. Uh, wait a minute. I

264
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:42,059
don't know about this part. Can you tell how deep the water is? Why does it say I have zero out of

265
00:41:42,059 --> 00:41:56,150
one metal beams? Should I just go for it? All right. I'm just going to go for it. You just cover

266
00:41:56,150 --> 00:42:01,030
a room with mirrors. I will forget that I was fighting you and I'll start like punching myself

267
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:24,739
in the mirror. We're good. Attach a trailer. You should approach it. Let me attach a trailer.

268
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:38,230
Is there another one? Is there, is it, wait, is there another trailer here? No. Why would they

269
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:55,800
show me that? I'm not putting, I'm not making a choo-choo train. Not right now. Turn the hints

270
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:03,639
off. Well, I might, I might need them. All right. This looks like this is getting narrow. Hold on.

271
00:43:03,639 --> 00:43:15,619
I got to focus. My game seems like crashing. Oh, 30, 90, 30, 90. All right. Now we're getting a

272
00:43:15,619 --> 00:43:41,429
left here, right? Come on. You can make it. It's getting to be nighttime. You see that? I was just

273
00:43:41,429 --> 00:43:46,469
taking a left. I was just taking a left at the intersection. That's what they do. They're like,

274
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:56,699
oh shit. Fuck. What do I do? How do I get out of this? It's this, it's this goddamn

275
00:43:56,699 --> 00:44:03,579
mirror. I don't want the mirror anymore. It's the mirror. Can I attach it? Just wait, hold on.

276
00:44:03,579 --> 00:44:33,530
Recover vehicle to start zone. What? Can I push? Cargo will be lost. Oh, come on. No.

277
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:45,670
You can't blame everything on drugs and mirrors. Okay. Well, I'm going to,

278
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:54,199
what if I just quit the game? Oh, let me attach the trailer. Trailer's too far away. God damn it.

279
00:44:54,199 --> 00:45:03,989
I have to do the whole thing again. Pain's truck. Fuck. How? Whatever. Recover vehicle.

280
00:45:05,719 --> 00:45:18,659
Why did I detach the thing? Why? Use the winch? I can't use the winch. It broke. What has the

281
00:45:18,659 --> 00:45:29,369
most damage? This thing is fine. I just need to flip it. Can I like flip it somehow? No,

282
00:45:29,369 --> 00:45:34,570
I'm just going to reload. Truck recovery. Go on. Whatever. Okay. Great. This is fantastic.

283
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:47,190
Oh my God. I have to do the whole thing again. All right. No, don't fuck this up this time.

284
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:54,260
Doesn't matter. I don't have to do it in order. Let's go. All right. I'm doing this quick.

285
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:59,559
Fuck. Okay. Get the, go get the attached trailer. Put the lumber in the trailer.

286
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:08,699
Head this way. Go that way. I'm going to make, no, do it right. Do it right. Fucking mirrors. I

287
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:15,190
swear to God. All right. I'm going to go here. We're going to clear all things. Here. I'm going

288
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:22,360
to get the trailer and then I'm going to get the lumber. We're then going to go this way.

289
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:32,489
Here. Don't be a stupid idiot. Here we go. Up here. And then we're going to go out this way.

290
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:45,619
This guy high. No. I mean, look, now I get, now I understand how fragile the car is. Okay. Wait,

291
00:46:45,619 --> 00:46:55,780
what? Hold on. Everything's over here. Oh, wait. Hold on a second. I can skip this. I don't have

292
00:46:55,780 --> 00:47:02,039
to go to the lumber mill. All right. Don't go to the lumber mill. I can go reclaim everything.

293
00:47:02,039 --> 00:47:10,539
All right. That's fine. Let's go. Don't fuck around. I need a gas station though.

294
00:47:10,539 --> 00:47:16,059
I'll put the face cam on when I get to the, I'll get, I'll put the face cam on when I get to the

295
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:28,860
bridge. Okay. Wait, what are you guys saying? You don't have a crane. What do you mean? I have to,

296
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:33,820
wait, I have to go get the lumber stuff because I don't have a crane. Oh, for the love of God.

297
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:36,860
All right. Fine. All right. All right. I'll just go get, it's right here. I'm just kidding. I'll

298
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:51,690
get it. It's right here. Can I sleep? How do I pass time? Yeah. I'm sleeping. Sleep. How do I

299
00:47:51,690 --> 00:48:09,739
sleep? All right. Sleep. Skip time. Skip time. Morning. There we go. Now I can see. Let's do

300
00:48:09,739 --> 00:48:18,150
this again. You might be able to put a crane on the truck. All right. Let's get the lumber. No.

301
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:32,019
No, this is wrong because I need to get the, all right. I have to get a trailer. There's two of

302
00:48:32,019 --> 00:48:36,489
those, but I need the, hold on a second. I need the trailer because I need to bring, I can't,

303
00:48:36,489 --> 00:48:39,210
I got to bring the trailer up there. Wait, there's a trailer up there. Yeah, there is. Okay.

304
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:52,809
Where the metal is, there's a trailer up there. Imagine what your boss thinks about this omega

305
00:48:52,809 --> 00:49:14,710
low. That doesn't matter to me. I'm my own boss. When was the last time you smoked a crack pipe?

306
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:27,190
I've never smoked a crack pipe in my life ever. So none. Not, no, never. My own boss. I don't want

307
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:58,380
to run out of gas. That's important. No, no drugs. Drug free. No face cam, no food. I'm going to be

308
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:15,190
all right. Okay. I will now give you exactly five minutes of face cam starting now. I fucking can't

309
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:22,409
be trusted. I really can't. What's over here? All right. The trailer is right there. Go get the

310
00:50:22,409 --> 00:50:36,969
trailer. Where's this trailer? This fucking cameraman. Like, oh, stop. Who's flying the drone

311
00:50:36,969 --> 00:50:53,110
around the car? Just stay here. All right. Is this it? New trailer. This thing's huge. This thing is

312
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:57,269
gigantic. All right. That just went into the windshield and I get the guy in the head.

313
00:50:57,269 --> 00:51:08,920
Attached trailer. Oh my God. It's too big. How? How do I do this? What is this even attached to?

314
00:51:09,719 --> 00:51:25,769
I do have to, but I have cargo. This is, I don't, this is bad. This is the wrong truck. I can't

315
00:51:25,769 --> 00:51:41,699
handle this. Oh for the love of God. Are you serious? Oh shit. So I need to go get a different

316
00:51:41,699 --> 00:52:12,730
trailer. So I have to go recover this trailer down here. That's what you're saying. I don't

317
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:21,980
think I can. This is stupid. Just drive. Just drive. Don't run over this person's pool.

318
00:52:25,769 --> 00:52:32,710
Why is there a pool made out of concrete? Why is there a pool made out of a tree stump? What?

319
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:43,380
Why is there a concrete pool in your front yard? I can't, I see you saying I can't put this trailer

320
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:55,110
on my thing here. All right. Can I, I'm just going to, can I just drop this off of the bridge

321
00:52:55,110 --> 00:53:05,820
and come back? All right. Let's think about this logically. There is where I need to get the metal

322
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:21,800
here. So what I'm going to do, there's wood down here. Can I get a crane? What do you think? Just

323
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:39,139
take two trips, my man. I, it said I had to do it in order. La la waiting, whatever. But I have to

324
00:53:39,139 --> 00:53:49,000
do it in order. Remember most pools are made of concrete. Not an above ground pool in your front

325
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:56,099
yard. Above ground pools are not made out of concrete. Dump the planks? All right. Yeah.

326
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:58,980
All right. I'm going to dump the plants in. All right. Fuck it. We're doing two trips. I don't

327
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:17,369
care. What is it supposed to be made of? I don't know. It's like a plastic like bendy flat polymer

328
00:54:17,369 --> 00:54:24,789
thing. I don't know. It's not concrete. It's made out of like a hard weird like polyurethane

329
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:32,230
plastic. I don't know. It's made it as something that's not metal. It's like plastic and above

330
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:37,139
ground pool. What is it made out of? I'm going to look it up right now. What's an above ground

331
00:54:37,139 --> 00:54:51,500
pool made out of? Above ground pools are made out of steel, aluminum, and resin. Okay. It's made out

332
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:57,579
of resin. Here are the advantages and disadvantages. It's resin. It's made out of resin. I don't know

333
00:54:57,579 --> 00:55:08,039
what resin is. I just know what it is. I just know that it's a thing that can be made out of stuff.

334
00:55:11,239 --> 00:55:17,340
Resin is concrete. Resin is not concrete. Resin is like the shit that comes out of fucking plant sap.

335
00:55:18,309 --> 00:55:22,150
Resin is the stuff that like a tree like has like the sap coming out of it. That's what resin is.

336
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:42,329
That's wrong. It's not wrong. All right. Here we go. Cargo management. Let's go. I need metal

337
00:55:42,329 --> 00:55:58,920
beams. I need to unload this shit. How do I unload? Unpack cargo. Okay. Unpack cargo. How do I unpack

338
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:20,969
the cargo? Unpack cargo. I don't want to remove the cargo. I want to unpack it. That's exactly

339
00:56:20,969 --> 00:56:37,590
what I didn't want to do. I'm gonna be all right. Everything's fine. Fuck it. Whatever. I don't even

340
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:42,309
care. Let's go. Cargo management. Give me the metal. Let's go. Okay. All right. Bye. Let's go.

341
00:56:42,309 --> 00:57:01,849
Go. Go. Go. Don't drive into a wall. Resin has trees in it, right? Other way around. You know

342
00:57:01,849 --> 00:57:13,559
what I mean? Say what I said backwards. This tree resin, right? Five minutes are up, by the way.

343
00:57:21,719 --> 00:57:26,599
This thing is pulling to the left. I'm not doing that. Oh, wait. It's like a real car. You have

344
00:57:26,599 --> 00:57:32,659
to actually change the wheel before you go anywhere. There's a Muppet Muppet streamer.

345
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:48,650
I'm just gonna do it one at a time. Ooh la la. No. Give it a rest. Not with that.

346
00:57:51,239 --> 00:58:06,920
Just drive. Please. I refuse to do that with the camera on because I find it embarrassing.

347
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:21,059
I need to refuel though. I'm driving this car like there's a bunch of bees in it. Can I please

348
00:58:21,059 --> 00:58:38,949
straighten out? All right. Refuel. Anytime there's a bug in the car, like a wasp or a bee or something,

349
00:58:38,949 --> 00:58:43,269
you kind of just have that freak out mode where you roll down every single window in the car and

350
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:49,349
scream and just stay still. You just hope that it's like, and he just goes out the window.

351
00:58:51,750 --> 00:59:11,289
I can make that, right? All right. I'm almost at that point. Can I lift this up? I'm gonna do

352
00:59:11,289 --> 00:59:21,699
a tester. Okay. This is where the, this is where the catastrophe started. Can I do anything about

353
00:59:21,699 --> 00:59:28,900
this? Stop. Stop moving. Stop moving. Stop moving. Stop moving. Stop moving.

354
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:47,099
I'm not gonna fall in there again. Nope. Not gonna happen. Oh, handbrake. Okay. Wait, let go of it.

355
00:59:49,820 --> 01:00:10,820
Can I attach it to the, I'm gonna attach to the, here we go. Right there. Pull it. Come on. What?

356
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:23,800
Oh, it's the fucking pole. Give me a break. Flip it. No, no, no. I'll just at least get it out of

357
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:34,250
the, get it away from that thing. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. It's flipped.

358
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:55,960
I flipped it. Let it go. Okay. I feel like this is probably too dangerous.

359
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:06,969
I'm gonna deliver this first. I'm not fucking around. I'm not gonna do this now. All right.

360
01:01:06,969 --> 01:01:17,190
Here's the bridge. How do I do this? Do I just drive up and it just does it automatically?

361
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:31,210
Okay. Nice. Gargo management. When unloading the cargo, you may be presented with different

362
01:01:31,210 --> 01:01:36,730
unloading options as one cargo may be used to complete different objectives. While the cargo,

363
01:01:37,289 --> 01:01:41,449
while the current unloading area is used only to complete your current job, there may be others

364
01:01:41,449 --> 01:01:54,840
that are used in multiple contracts. Okay. Unload. Nice. The bridge is on its way,

365
01:01:54,840 --> 01:02:02,630
but not there yet to click. You need to deliver more lumber mill. Okay. Nice. Thank you.

366
01:02:03,349 --> 01:02:09,829
I was about to step on the gas, just drive off and just watch chat. No, it's too early for that.

367
01:02:10,550 --> 01:02:21,239
Have to do a fall joke. I can't, I want to, can I just pick these up? I don't have a crane.

368
01:02:21,239 --> 01:02:29,159
Somebody said I need a crane. You got to hit that yoinky splinky.

369
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:41,510
Just recover. You're going to spawn next to the lumber mill. Well, let me just see if I can even

370
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:51,289
do this. Cause if I can, that's good. Can I just go next to this and wait, can I just attach the

371
01:02:51,289 --> 01:03:02,260
winch to this? Just drag it. I probably can. Why wouldn't I? Right. Oh, what the hell? Really?

372
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:16,840
Okay. Remove cargo. No, it's the new hot tech talk dance. The yoinky splinky.

373
01:03:17,559 --> 01:03:30,500
This is way too dangerous. This is, yeah, it's too dangerous. Um, I'm just going to go get it.

374
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:50,920
Like, I don't care. I need to have complete level one. You know what I mean? I love how he

375
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:56,710
just ignores you all. You got to hit that yoinky splinky. I don't know what the hell you're talking

376
01:03:56,710 --> 01:04:07,739
about. What is a yoinky splinky? Um, that, the yoinky splinky is somebody's legs behind their

377
01:04:07,739 --> 01:04:36,730
head. Like moving. What was that? Yoinky splinky or no food. What a virgin. What are you talking

378
01:04:36,730 --> 01:04:54,969
about? This dude doesn't know the yoinky splinky. Ah, what a virgin. Is this lumber mill? All right.

379
01:04:54,969 --> 01:05:07,619
Yes. Why does he keep reading the worst comments? I'm not. He's pretending, right? He actually

380
01:05:07,619 --> 01:05:15,139
knows what it is. I don't really. All right. Lumber mill. Let's go. And look, perfectly loaded

381
01:05:15,139 --> 01:05:27,719
lumber. Although I'm just going to say, fuck it and just do this. All right. Fargo. I need

382
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:53,079
wooden plank, wooden plank. Let's go. Done. Move. Just know your meme page for the yoinky splinky.

383
01:05:56,099 --> 01:05:59,619
I don't know. I'm not. All right. I'm going to move on because I don't know

384
01:05:59,619 --> 01:06:04,619
nor do I need to put that much more time into knowing what this is. You know what I'm saying?

385
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:13,670
I'm just saying. That's been in my head for like a month. I don't know why.

386
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:30,010
That just keeps jumping in. I don't, I don't know how. I don't know. What setting am I on? Um,

387
01:06:30,809 --> 01:06:41,340
I just normal, a career mode, I think. I don't know. All right. We're almost done with level one

388
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:52,619
and then I'm going to unlock hopefully the ice level. Slow down here. I don't want to blow it

389
01:06:52,619 --> 01:07:06,099
here. Part of me just wants to take a left and just drive. No, that goes under the bridge. Why

390
01:07:06,099 --> 01:07:11,960
would I do that? I was about to do it or just driven into the water. That would have been a

391
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:34,099
disaster. Okay. Very good. Learn. Not again. That turn is fucked. It is. That turn comes up on you

392
01:07:34,099 --> 01:07:50,219
hard and it just dumps you if you don't do it right. We're good. I'm concerned about how you

393
01:07:50,219 --> 01:07:58,260
drive in real life. I don't have a, a class truck license and I'm using my left thumb to drive a

394
01:07:58,260 --> 01:08:20,659
car. This is not how you drive a real car. All right. So now what? I got promoted. I just think,

395
01:08:20,659 --> 01:08:26,899
I just see that guy's face. I just, I just think of the, the pawn star as a guy. Now I let me change

396
01:08:26,899 --> 01:08:31,140
that guy every time he just keeps popping in my head with like a hat on. All right. When you get

397
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:36,060
enough experience, you can get a new driver rank. Every rank provides you with new options

398
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:40,460
regarding vehicle and add on purchasing. Cool. Objectives may also require you to reach a certain

399
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:48,949
driver rank before they are unlocked. Press down to access your driver profile. Oh, now we can leave

400
01:08:48,949 --> 01:08:55,739
the peninsula and reach the garage. Oh, I got 2100 bucks. Nice. Every contract completed will provide

401
01:08:55,739 --> 01:09:00,460
you with money and experience points. Every watch tower discoverable will avoid you with experience.

402
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:10,789
XP allows you to unlock new driver ranks. Cool. All right. Nice. Let's go and find the garage.

403
01:09:10,789 --> 01:09:16,949
It's now marked on the map. My driver ranks. I'm never going to change that profile picture ever.

404
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:28,260
That was the please don't recognize me in Team Fortress 2 Avatar. This is your driver profile.

405
01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:37,659
You can learn a lot of useful information about your progress here. Cool. Yeah. There's 89 missions

406
01:09:37,659 --> 01:09:47,399
in this game. Holy shit. All right. Let's go to the garage. Yep. He hates his fans. No,

407
01:09:49,670 --> 01:09:54,869
no. When I used to play TF2 and make TF2 videos, I wanted to make sure that I was at like the same

408
01:09:55,430 --> 01:10:00,949
exact level as everybody else. So if my name was Jerma985 and I was like, hey guys, it's me,

409
01:10:00,949 --> 01:10:06,279
Jerma985. Two people on the other team we switched to spy. There'd be three snipers that were just

410
01:10:06,279 --> 01:10:11,399
aiming for my head. Six people would just stand at the spawn holding their hand in the air and it

411
01:10:11,399 --> 01:10:17,420
wouldn't even be a game of Team Fortress anymore. So when I was hiding, I was just another player.

412
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:23,779
So it was just completely, nobody knew. That's a guy on the other team. I didn't want to like

413
01:10:23,779 --> 01:10:29,130
fuck up games. I didn't want to go in there and like there's a whole game going on and be like,

414
01:10:29,130 --> 01:10:35,930
everybody, it's me. I'm here. Where's the line of people? I'm in the server now. Hello.

415
01:10:40,010 --> 01:10:47,960
My name was like dogshit burrito and I had like weird avatars that weren't connected to me at all.

416
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:56,380
He's a celebrity. Oh, look at me. He's a celebrity. No, that's not what I'm saying.

417
01:10:56,380 --> 01:11:16,310
Oh, watch tower. Oh, look at this celebrity. No, I'm not a celebrity. You're too important to play

418
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:26,859
TF2. That's not, that's not even what I'm saying. Oh, fuck. I'm stuck. I should have paid attention.

419
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:56,970
Can I get out? I'm not going this way. Where's the winch connected to? Get me out. I'm buried in this

420
01:11:56,970 --> 01:12:08,020
mud. I can't go anywhere. Shit. What do I do? Well, how was I supposed to know there was this

421
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:19,670
weird terrain over here? Low gear. All right. We're just going in. Come on. Just dig through it. Just

422
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:27,399
dig. Is it true that you sharted when you jumped through the window? Yes. I'm just going to give

423
01:12:27,399 --> 01:12:31,159
you that one. You probably just like started laughing. You're probably like, why did you even

424
01:12:31,159 --> 01:12:41,800
respond to that? What the fuck? All right. I'm stuck again. All right. Now I'm going to attach

425
01:12:41,800 --> 01:13:00,390
a winch to something over here. Go. Pull me. Pull me through the mud. Come on. All right. Now winch

426
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:11,189
and not winch something else. Handbrake right there. Let's go. This was a huge mistake coming

427
01:13:11,189 --> 01:13:20,739
down here. Come on. Come on. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Stop. I don't want to screw this

428
01:13:20,739 --> 01:13:26,199
up. I probably shouldn't even drive down this. Wait. Can I go that way? All right. I'm going to

429
01:13:26,199 --> 01:13:43,369
go across this way. It should get me at least over here. I don't want to drive through the mud. This

430
01:13:43,369 --> 01:13:55,989
car can't go through the mud. But I can't go through this either. What the fuck? What?

431
01:13:56,710 --> 01:14:09,770
What do you mean? This is so wet over here. Can I not go here? It's so wet over here. Is it another

432
01:14:09,770 --> 01:14:25,770
car? It's still mud. Oh, well I think I'll be all right. I can just pull myself. All right. I'm going

433
01:14:25,770 --> 01:14:36,939
to stay in low gear. Let's just stay on the road maybe. Yeah. This one's not deep. It should be

434
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:43,449
okay. There's water here though. Oh God. Don't drive through that. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

435
01:14:43,449 --> 01:14:50,279
What is that? That's deep mud over there. I think I just screwed myself completely.

436
01:14:50,920 --> 01:15:02,149
I think I'm such a guy. Do I have to just go for it? I have to turn around. Oh my God. Give me a

437
01:15:02,149 --> 01:15:11,579
break. Really? Can I just get out of the car and sprint? Drive through or no balls. Full send. Full

438
01:15:11,579 --> 01:15:17,720
send. Yeah. All right. Let's laugh about the fact that I have to start over again. Where's the garage?

439
01:15:21,609 --> 01:16:05,100
Okay. It's right here. Come on. Go right. How deep is this? This water's not deep at all. Hold on.

440
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:25,539
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. I'm all right. Okay. I'm so close to just touching this. I just want to

441
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:37,750
touch it. There it is. Like, no. I'm fine. Look it. I'm going to be all right. Check this out. I'm

442
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:51,819
going to get up here. What in God's name are you doing? I'm trying to get close enough where I can

443
01:16:51,819 --> 01:16:58,069
just drive into this and activate the fucking watch tower. Swamp joke. It's not a swamp joke.

444
01:16:58,710 --> 01:17:23,850
Stop pretending. There's nothing to. I was. There's nothing to pretend. Okay. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

445
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:44,069
Hold on. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Okay. Now that's exactly what I wanted to do.

446
01:17:45,590 --> 01:18:04,729
And everybody thought I was fucking stupid. Everybody thought I was an idiot.

447
01:18:05,289 --> 01:18:30,939
I'll show you in just a moment. You'll know very quickly here. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, what's

448
01:18:30,939 --> 01:19:06,060
that? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Hold on. Thank you. Let's go. Just get me out of the water.

449
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:12,659
I just have to touch this and I'll be fine. I'm not even in the water anymore. This is so stupid.

450
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:29,590
There we go. Got it. I want you to. I want every single person that said, I want you to go through

451
01:19:29,590 --> 01:19:32,949
the logs and find everyone that said he's going to get stuck in the water. Fucking idiot. He sucks.

452
01:19:32,949 --> 01:19:39,590
He's so stupid. He sucks at everything. And I want those people to be timed out for exactly one

453
01:19:39,590 --> 01:20:30,869
second. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. I'll be fine. Hold on. The laws of physics. I'm a physics major.

454
01:20:31,430 --> 01:20:41,159
I just have to get far enough over here. This sucks. Stop. I'm fine. It sucks.

455
01:20:42,039 --> 01:20:50,489
It's I'm do I just have to touch this and I'm going to reset. I'm almost out of gas. All right.

456
01:20:50,489 --> 01:20:58,100
Come on. Oh my God. I can't move it up. Just winching myself. This is bad. It's actually

457
01:20:58,100 --> 01:21:16,520
pretty bad. Can I get close enough to be able to attach to that? I'm almost there. Look at how

458
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:25,899
close I am. See the I can attach the winch up here. Come on, dude. Let's go. Yes. Yes.

459
01:21:25,899 --> 01:21:59,939
Yes. All right. Let's go. I just made so much more work for myself. That was so stupid.

460
01:22:03,659 --> 01:22:11,000
Pull me. Just pull me in. Pull me in. Pull me in. Pull me in. Pull me in. Yes. Touched out.

461
01:22:12,899 --> 01:22:28,939
Watch tower updated. Yes. There it is. And there I just have to get on the road.

462
01:22:29,659 --> 01:22:38,020
I probably have to go back. Arm in the garage. All right. I need to I get a different car.

463
01:22:39,479 --> 01:22:46,600
Can I actually get out of here though? I might be able to. No. Nope. Goodbye. I'm just going to

464
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:57,850
yeah I'm just going to recover the car. Look at that. Look at that shit. Change the truck.

465
01:22:57,850 --> 01:23:32,810
Thank you. Let's go. Wait. Can I attach to this? Wait. Holy shit. Okay. I should just

466
01:23:32,810 --> 01:23:41,420
I can take them both. All right. Don't be an idiot. I'm going to change. Let's change to the

467
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:50,439
truck. Yeah. I'll just bring it with me. Now let me it's can I attach it? Okay. How about

468
01:23:50,680 --> 01:24:01,060
attach trailer? No. Okay. All right. Attach winch to you here. And we're just going to pull it.

469
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:11,579
What's going on? I'm going to drive. Load the truck onto the other truck. I don't think I can

470
01:24:11,579 --> 01:24:33,979
do that. I'm going to have handbrake on. All right. Let's go. Now I need a good route here.

471
01:24:33,979 --> 01:24:44,279
Oh shit. I got to go all the way down here. God damn it. Okay. Let's get to here first.

472
01:24:44,279 --> 01:25:00,500
Who trucks? Yes. I'm thinking it's abandoning this and just getting in the goddamn truck.

473
01:25:00,579 --> 01:25:22,439
Don't you have a face cam? Cool. Because if I ever get in trouble, then I could just switch

474
01:25:22,439 --> 01:25:36,149
to the other truck and just walk off. It's simple. Simple. Yellow shirt. Yeah. I never

475
01:25:36,149 --> 01:25:45,779
usually wear yellow. You're right. I'm a blue, gray, dark, purple, black. My shirts are usually

476
01:25:45,779 --> 01:26:01,340
kind of in that zone. Sometimes red. Sometimes. Hope we can make this. We can. Good. Blue. Yeah.

477
01:26:01,340 --> 01:26:18,840
A lot of blue. I love blue. I'm running out of gas. Don't touch your hair.

478
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:33,050
Where's another fuel station? Oh shit. There's a watch tower here. Okay. There's not another

479
01:26:33,689 --> 01:26:43,779
gas station anywhere. Should I fuel up or just say fuck it and just go?

480
01:26:43,779 --> 01:26:53,989
I feel like I probably should get gas, but I'm not going to. Whatever. Did I? It is just right here.

481
01:26:53,989 --> 01:27:09,770
I'm going to get it. It'd be dumb to not get it. It's right here. Don't drive over the edge.

482
01:27:10,409 --> 01:27:17,060
You're going to be stranded if you don't get gas. Why don't you go to the garage?

483
01:27:17,060 --> 01:27:21,060
And that was the plan before. And then I went into the swamp accidentally.

484
01:27:21,779 --> 01:27:32,170
It was water here? Since when? Oh god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god.

485
01:27:32,170 --> 01:27:49,979
Oh my god. Oh my god. That's not. Is that fucking up that truck? Oh shit. Like water is just going

486
01:27:49,979 --> 01:28:00,199
into that car. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Get out. Change. Change. Change. Change. Change. Change.

487
01:28:06,739 --> 01:28:27,779
Okay. Here we go. No. Okay. Fuck. I don't want to do that. All right. Let's take care of this first.

488
01:28:27,779 --> 01:28:43,930
Then I'm going to drive across. Car alright. What's the damage? I think I'm okay. 100. 100.

489
01:28:43,930 --> 01:28:54,039
100. 82. That's all right. I'll be fine. Yeah. I'm good. I'll be good. Now I'm going to refill

490
01:28:54,039 --> 01:29:02,819
this one. Should I? I'm just driving. Whatever. I don't care. And I want to sleep too. I don't like

491
01:29:02,819 --> 01:29:07,369
the darkness. I don't like it. I can just press two buttons and it's bright out.

492
01:29:10,890 --> 01:29:15,510
Ram. Gas pump. No. I did that already. It doesn't do anything. I'm not doing it again.

493
01:29:30,380 --> 01:29:46,890
Go faster. How far? This car is going like 25 miles per hour. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. All right.

494
01:29:46,890 --> 01:29:53,590
We're good. Let's get it on the road here so I don't have to worry about it. Handbrake. Park it.

495
01:29:54,310 --> 01:30:16,939
Nice truck. Some guy's sister hates you. Okay. Camera in the top left. Actually you're right.

496
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:37,100
Put it up here actually. I'll flip it. That feels so weird doesn't it? I'm not going to put the

497
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:50,859
camera in the middle. That's bad. Can I get. Am I able to get out of this? Okay. Only out of the

498
01:30:50,859 --> 01:30:57,850
mud. I'm going to drive around this. This was stupid. I'm going to drive around this because

499
01:30:57,850 --> 01:31:05,159
why would I do this? This is the dumbest thing ever. I just broke the fucking tree. All right.

500
01:31:05,159 --> 01:31:28,489
How do I get out of here without causing a problem? No, no, no. Up here. Oh. All right. Thank

501
01:31:28,489 --> 01:31:36,729
God. Now how do I get out? Watch out. I'm going to abandon the truck. I'm going to abandon the

502
01:31:36,729 --> 01:31:43,319
trucker thing. I'm abandoning the trucker thing. I don't care. I don't want it. I don't want this

503
01:31:43,319 --> 01:32:11,060
truck anymore. I don't like it. Wait. Go. Go. Go. No. It's going to get trapped in the fucking

504
01:32:11,060 --> 01:32:37,020
lawnmower blades and I'm going to get stuck here. Oh, thank God. We're good. Finally. Okay. Fuel up

505
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:53,430
and then I'm going to drive around the creek. I'm not doing that again. Let's go. What's a better

506
01:32:53,430 --> 01:33:03,060
route to get over here? Oh, look at that. Okay. We've got the creek here. I could go down. No,

507
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:07,699
there's another creek. Okay. I'm just going. I'm just going. Let's go. I'm going. Fuck it.

508
01:33:28,149 --> 01:34:06,279
I'm so impatient. I can't. I'm going to get over here. Handbrake. Handbrake, please. Okay. Attach.

509
01:34:06,279 --> 01:34:22,069
Let's go. Come on. This is the mouse taking the splinter out of the lion's paw. Yes. All right.

510
01:34:22,069 --> 01:34:31,399
We're good. This is going. All right. I don't know if I should do this. It's getting too close.

511
01:34:31,399 --> 01:34:38,170
It's too heavy. It's too heavy. Okay. Stop. Stop. Stop. Slowly stop the cars. Slowly stop the cars.

512
01:34:38,170 --> 01:34:50,789
Slowly stop the cars. Okay. Stop. Handbrake. Okay. Switch cars immediately. All right. We're

513
01:34:50,789 --> 01:35:08,729
good. This is Karazhan level. What do you mean? Karazhan. All right. We're good. All right. I'm

514
01:35:08,729 --> 01:35:17,539
fine. Don't say those words. Are we ever going to wear a wig? Probably not. I don't know. It means

515
01:35:17,539 --> 01:35:22,260
comfy. Oh, they're comparing it to the worst stream I've ever done. I don't know. I disagree. I'm

516
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:29,529
having a good time. During the Karazhan stream, I was just like fucking hate streaming. I hate

517
01:35:29,529 --> 01:35:33,369
broadcasting. Like that was honestly like I just wanted to turn off my stream and never come back.

518
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:42,119
I was like I'm actually having a good time. Sunflowers? Yeah. I'll show you the sunflowers.

519
01:35:47,670 --> 01:35:54,500
Next stream. I'm going to start No More Heroes 3 this coming weekend. This is far from the worst.

520
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:57,300
Yeah. They're just trying to get, just trying to push buttons. They're just trying to like

521
01:35:57,300 --> 01:36:05,449
push your buttons. I get it. Okay. I got to be careful because I'm not going right.

522
01:36:08,220 --> 01:36:17,000
We need to go. Where's the garage? All right. I'm going to go down this road here and this is an

523
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:22,199
intersection here. Let's figure it out. I'm just going to go this way. We hate you for real.

524
01:36:23,420 --> 01:36:29,979
Oh, whatever. There's gas over here. That's fine. Good. All right.

525
01:36:30,619 --> 01:36:35,880
Take the regular road. Don't be an idiot. Don't go that way. What does that sign say? That sign,

526
01:36:37,579 --> 01:36:45,029
um, I don't even know what that is. That's a, that's like a truck.

527
01:36:46,819 --> 01:36:52,010
Okay. All right. I thought it was a mountain. Okay. It's a don't. Watch out. It's bumpy. I get it.

528
01:36:52,729 --> 01:37:07,140
Bumpy road. It's a beached whale. Okay. This is not that bad. It's pretty good.

529
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:23,880
Okay. Well, that's a problem. That's an issue. Can I go around it?

530
01:37:30,539 --> 01:37:42,310
Flores. I just did like a foster do raw. Why did that all get knocked down? Wait,

531
01:37:42,310 --> 01:37:53,609
can I honk on it? We'll break this. Uh, I'm going to get, I I'm getting in the other truck.

532
01:37:54,329 --> 01:38:02,380
I'm not going to screw around here in the other car. First of all, turn the engine off of this.

533
01:38:02,380 --> 01:38:15,619
How do I do that? The handbrake on, turn the engine off. Let's go. I'm not going to mess around

534
01:38:15,619 --> 01:38:26,649
here. I have to get around this. I go through it. I can just go through here. Excuse me. Um,

535
01:38:27,750 --> 01:38:47,539
excuse me. I can't go through it. It's there's a wall there. I'm going to keep all wheel drive on.

536
01:38:47,539 --> 01:38:58,579
Should I be doing this? Is this the correct thing to do? I can't even see in front of me.

537
01:38:59,220 --> 01:39:13,060
There's no way I'm going to be able to get the Mack truck over here. All right. Back on the road.

538
01:39:13,060 --> 01:39:22,300
Garage. I'm going to the garage right now. That's the plan. All right. Well, that's what that truck

539
01:39:22,300 --> 01:39:26,869
is. I can come back later. Maybe. I don't know. All right. Where do I go from here? Straight down

540
01:39:26,869 --> 01:39:52,010
here. Let's go. That's enough of the face cam face cam has been allotted. Stop. I'm not just going to

541
01:39:52,010 --> 01:39:56,250
drive that way. It's a bad idea. This is the first area I want to get. I at least want to see like

542
01:39:56,250 --> 01:40:02,890
one or two more areas. I want to see the snow level. I want to see the, I don't know. I want to

543
01:40:02,890 --> 01:40:07,449
see like the other zones. I don't want to just see the mud area. This is cool, but I want to see snow

544
01:40:07,449 --> 01:40:30,470
and ice. Stop driving in the middle of the road. Why? The drunker I get, the more that I enjoy.

545
01:40:31,350 --> 01:40:43,369
You drinking and just hanging out. All right. All right. There's a watch tower over here. All right.

546
01:40:43,369 --> 01:40:50,229
Um, so we need to go right to the farm. We need to go down here. That's probably, that's like a,

547
01:40:50,229 --> 01:40:53,270
that's going to be like the Lord of the Rings part where they're on the side of the mountain.

548
01:40:54,069 --> 01:41:09,640
Like the rocks are fighting each other or whatever. Don't even tell me. Don't get stuck here.

549
01:41:10,199 --> 01:41:29,539
Are you kidding me? How? Oh, how did that even happen? All right. Let's go. Keep it on low gear

550
01:41:31,659 --> 01:41:38,680
and just, am I going to get stuck here? Is there another car? You have all wheel drive off.

551
01:41:39,239 --> 01:41:58,470
Shit, that's right. Thanks. All right. New area farm. I wonder if there's a, a new car. Is low

552
01:41:58,470 --> 01:42:02,869
gear better? I think it is because it doesn't move the tires. Look, I'm going to say something really

553
01:42:02,869 --> 01:42:07,350
stupid probably. And those of you that know anything about cars and off-roading is low

554
01:42:07,350 --> 01:42:14,760
gear better because the tires like grip the ground and the tires spin slower. Is it like,

555
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:20,420
oh, the tires spin slower and that grips the ground harder. That's correct, right?

556
01:42:21,140 --> 01:42:37,579
There's more torque, right? It spins slower. Yeah. Okay. So I had it right. There's less

557
01:42:37,579 --> 01:42:46,489
displacement to the ground. Yeah. Yeah. Nice. Um, what's even over here? Not really anything.

558
01:42:47,130 --> 01:42:50,489
All right. This is where it gets dangerous. I'm kind of afraid of this part, but let's just go.

559
01:42:50,489 --> 01:43:07,640
Whatever. Screw it. I got plenty of gas. I'm going to make it. I hope it's very rocky over here. This

560
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:19,659
is bumpy. This is getting bumpy. Do this in real life. I would have died an hour ago.

561
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:35,609
Stream would just be live of wherever I ended up. So no, the camera would just be pointing to the

562
01:43:35,609 --> 01:43:43,500
sky. So whatever like ravine I fell in. Nope. No, thank you. Leave it to the professionals.

563
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:03,579
All right. We're almost there. This is, I don't, I got to be careful here because this is really,

564
01:44:03,579 --> 01:44:08,539
really muddy. I'm going to try to drive away from that because I don't want to get stuck in that.

565
01:44:09,180 --> 01:44:17,140
We avoid it. Don't tip. Don't tip. You're good. All right. I got to assess the situation here.

566
01:44:19,609 --> 01:44:46,500
I kind of need to, uh, go around the left side. Uh-oh. Uh, okay. How are you supposed to do this?

567
01:44:48,439 --> 01:45:02,739
Don't fall in the water. Oh my goodness. Don't fall in the water. I can't move the car.

568
01:45:02,739 --> 01:45:17,720
All right. Just all wheel drive, floor it, pull. We're good. When does the stream start? Uh,

569
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:39,239
starting soon. No, no, no, no. Attach here. Right here. And then we're going to go all wheel drive,

570
01:45:40,060 --> 01:45:54,859
pull floor it. Nice. I made it up. I did it. We're almost there. I'm almost in the garage.

571
01:45:54,859 --> 01:46:05,930
I've almost completed chapter one. I've almost done it. I don't think I have to be in a low gear

572
01:46:05,930 --> 01:46:20,939
right now. Yeah, this is fine. Oops. Hold on. In the grass. Remember the road you avoided in

573
01:46:20,939 --> 01:46:27,619
the beginning led to the garage. Yeah. We got to do it the hard way. There it is. Nice. Finally.

574
01:46:29,350 --> 01:46:37,539
I made it. You've discovered your first garage. What you have done so far is the meat of the game.

575
01:46:37,539 --> 01:46:41,380
Explore and discover watchtowers, complete contracts, earn rewards and find garages

576
01:46:41,380 --> 01:46:50,250
to improve or buy new vehicles. Vehicles. All right. So what do I do? Upgrade location

577
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:56,329
discovered. Get upgrade. You can find upgrades in the world. They may not apply to your current

578
01:46:56,329 --> 01:47:02,899
vehicle, but will be useful for others. An all wheel drive powertrain that can provide torque

579
01:47:02,979 --> 01:47:12,539
connected. Not available for the current truck. Okay. Whoa. What happened with that? Garage

580
01:47:12,539 --> 01:47:26,229
discovered. You can use the garage to turn your truck into a real monster. All right. 850 bucks.

581
01:47:26,869 --> 01:47:34,439
What do I do? Customize. The garage is used to store, upgrade, customize, buy and sell vehicles,

582
01:47:34,439 --> 01:47:43,260
but also for traveling to other regions. Okay. Holy shit. All right. The engine. You can upgrade

583
01:47:43,260 --> 01:47:52,500
the engine. That means more power. That's what I currently have. Explore Michigan to find this.

584
01:47:53,140 --> 01:48:03,819
I don't have any of these things. Stock gearbox. More control. Suspension. What the hell?

585
01:48:05,189 --> 01:48:17,460
I want that. And I want huge tires. Ooh, wait a minute. Highway all-terrain or all-terrain?

586
01:48:18,100 --> 01:48:29,130
What do I have? I have 8,800 bucks. On-road good, off-road average. Off-road. Okay. On-road average,

587
01:48:29,130 --> 01:48:42,170
off-road good. Mud average. Mud good. Right? I think I want mud. Mud good. But on truck nuts.

588
01:48:44,949 --> 01:48:50,069
Excellent on-road, but this is okay. I have terrible in mud right now. I definitely want to get,

589
01:48:50,789 --> 01:48:56,710
who cares about on-road? It's a regular road. You're going to be fine. Let's go with,

590
01:48:56,710 --> 01:49:11,829
let's go with mud. Let's go with the 31 inch AS2s. I think so. A winch. Whoa. A low strength winch

591
01:49:11,829 --> 01:49:15,750
set up with a dedicated battery unit. Not as powerful as more common variants. It can operate

592
01:49:15,750 --> 01:49:22,359
even when the vehicle's engine is turned off. That's a lot of money. I'll keep the stock one.

593
01:49:23,909 --> 01:49:34,069
Engageable lock? Snorkel? What do you mean a snorkel? A mushroom-shaped snorkel that protects

594
01:49:34,069 --> 01:49:37,750
your engine from taking in water. Wait, wait. Actually, I put my mouth on that and breathe?

595
01:49:38,310 --> 01:49:48,550
What does that, what do you mean a snorkel? I gotta get that, right? Yeah, I want the snorkel

596
01:49:48,550 --> 01:49:55,529
because then I can go into water. Frame add-ons. Can't do any of these. Can I do any? Oh, rear

597
01:49:55,529 --> 01:50:09,399
bumper. I have 10. Oh, I definitely have to get the park ranger beacon, right? Yeah. I want the

598
01:50:09,399 --> 01:50:27,579
Jurassic park vehicle. Alright, front bumper. I like that. Miscellaneous. Side pipe thresholds?

599
01:50:27,579 --> 01:50:35,180
Sure. What about rims? Why would I want rims? They just don't, they just get really dirty.

600
01:50:35,899 --> 01:50:53,979
I can change the color. Did I make it the German 985 mobile? Okay. Can I do any other colors?

601
01:50:55,020 --> 01:51:01,029
Well, I can do that one at least. That's fine. The Jurassic park vehicle is that color, isn't it?

602
01:51:03,130 --> 01:51:21,609
Bobbleheads? Oh! Auto! I can't believe there's an auto! Accessories. Hearts, ace of spades,

603
01:51:21,609 --> 01:51:32,779
autumn leaf, golden leaf, pine tree. Uh, how about um, dream catcher, hype monster,

604
01:51:33,829 --> 01:51:54,250
ranch. How about let's go with uh, let's go with rental car. There. Stickers. Shut up and take my

605
01:51:54,250 --> 01:52:04,810
winch. Light my fire. Your adventure. Should I do what like those people do when they have like,

606
01:52:06,069 --> 01:52:24,970
Clinton Gore, like 1998, like still on their car. Bush Chaney. I'm in charge. Wild. Off-road. How

607
01:52:24,970 --> 01:52:39,479
about his mud? I like that one. Exterior stickers? Oh god. Hot warning. Harsh driver. I kind of like

608
01:52:39,479 --> 01:52:55,079
the bullwinkle one. I like mud monster. Swamp surfer. Off-road club. King of the hill. Mastodon.

609
01:52:55,640 --> 01:53:13,189
Wing mechanic. It's crazy that like, all these could be the label of every craft beer I've ever

610
01:53:13,189 --> 01:53:36,010
had. Oh, the crazy elephant! Oh, I like the tiger. Hide. Pedal to the metal. Pumped up. Young

611
01:53:36,010 --> 01:53:54,180
driving. Top gear. Truck. Truck. For mother Russia. I like this one. This reminds me of like, every

612
01:53:54,180 --> 01:53:58,100
90s fucking beverage that you had that was available. That was off-brand. That wasn't like

613
01:53:58,100 --> 01:54:11,460
Pepsi or Coke brand. I like it. Windshield stickers. Don't these get in the way? Where's um,

614
01:54:11,460 --> 01:54:24,359
live laugh love? Where is it? I hope it's here. Must eat mud. Just putting that shit on an off-road

615
01:54:24,359 --> 01:54:42,470
car. I like must eat mud. That's a good one. Bulldog. Dolphin. Cobra. Stavortooth. How about

616
01:54:42,470 --> 01:54:54,710
the, uh, how about the cobra? All right, cool. I wish I had more to do. Well, at least I got better

617
01:54:54,710 --> 01:55:15,850
tires. Can I clean it? Truck store. Oh, man. Are you serious? All right, truck store. This is your

618
01:55:15,850 --> 01:55:26,329
truck store. You have to be a certain rank. Oh, Chevy CK 1500. What else is there? 126,000.

619
01:55:27,479 --> 01:55:37,579
What is that? Wait, wait, you, I can actually buy these? You can drive around in a crane? Why?

620
01:55:37,579 --> 01:55:56,140
There's a lot of cars. Is that a fire truck? Oh, that's pretty cool. Highway. Heavy duty. Heavy.

621
01:55:56,869 --> 01:56:08,060
Off-road. Scout. Damn it. I want this so bad. That sucks that I can't have it. This truck is

622
01:56:08,060 --> 01:56:18,680
not available in North America. What? I can't buy this because I live in America? Not available in

623
01:56:18,680 --> 01:56:33,640
North America? Am I getting like country gated? Why? Oh, in game. Oh, I was going to say that's

624
01:56:33,640 --> 01:56:39,420
insane. Sorry, sorry. These are, these are only available in, uh, in like Russia. These are only

625
01:56:39,420 --> 01:56:48,760
available in like EU. Only available in Europe. I was desperately trying to figure out what that

626
01:56:48,760 --> 01:56:58,310
actually meant. All right. Well, I got my cool car now. Some interesting trucks or resources can

627
01:56:58,310 --> 01:57:02,630
only be found in other locations. Let's do some traveling. Prepare your truck for transportation

628
01:57:02,630 --> 01:57:08,949
by using the retain function with X. Retain. Vehicle is now placed in the truck storage.

629
01:57:08,949 --> 01:57:17,319
You're ready to travel. Go to the global map with Y. Oh shit. Okay. You're currently in Michigan.

630
01:57:17,319 --> 01:57:34,039
Let's go to Alaska. Let's go to Alaska. Yes. Awesome. Snow time. Let's go. You have a garage

631
01:57:34,039 --> 01:57:37,800
waiting for you here. This is your primary base of operations for the time being. Let's get inside,

632
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:49,220
select the garage and the objects tab and enter it. Garage. This is what I was looking forward to.

633
01:57:49,220 --> 01:58:09,560
We finally get to play the title. All right. Truck storage. Where's my truck? DLC. Oh, look at these.

634
01:58:09,560 --> 01:58:17,529
There's so much cooler. That's, I want this, but I don't have enough money. Why is it $20,000 to buy

635
01:58:17,529 --> 01:58:28,409
this? Oh, I can sell it. Oh, I can sell this and buy this. What's the DLC? How much does it cost?

636
01:58:28,409 --> 01:58:37,449
Can I deploy it? Holy shit. I actually do own it. Why do I own? I own the DLC. Did I buy the like

637
01:58:37,449 --> 01:58:44,739
exclusive edition? How do I own this? Are you kidding me? That's awesome. I'm so happy. Just

638
01:58:44,739 --> 01:58:51,880
sell it all and just put like a bunch of truck nuts on the car. I think I bought, I must have

639
01:58:51,880 --> 01:58:57,239
bought the digital deluxe version of the game. Oh hell yeah. I want to see how this works.

640
01:58:57,239 --> 01:59:04,489
All right. What am I? I'm going to sell one so I can upgrade, I think. No, I just want to see what

641
01:59:04,489 --> 01:59:10,939
it looks like. Over to Alaska. Now, you know, the basics of the game is up to you to scout,

642
01:59:10,939 --> 01:59:16,600
accept contracts and upgrade or buy new vehicles and conquer the wilderness. Completing contracts

643
01:59:16,600 --> 01:59:20,039
in Alaska might be tougher because of the weather conditions. If you want to be more prepared,

644
01:59:20,039 --> 01:59:33,609
you're free to come back to Michigan and explore Alaska later. Let's, hell yeah. All right. I'm

645
01:59:33,609 --> 01:59:38,229
going to go, I want to just take a look for a minute. I was going to go up down. I was going

646
01:59:38,229 --> 01:59:42,310
to, I went into the watch tower. I'm going to go down the road. All right. We have enterprise.

647
01:59:43,189 --> 01:59:48,699
Let's look at how much shit there is here. Type, line, instruction, oil delivery.

648
01:59:49,579 --> 01:59:58,680
And this is very overwhelming. Drilling equipment, drill rig, from water to land,

649
01:59:59,720 --> 02:00:09,140
oil delivery. Okay. Deliver to the service site. I need oil barrels. I need to deliver oil barrels

650
02:00:09,140 --> 02:00:21,720
to a bunch of places. Where do I get the oil barrels? Okay. I'm invested. Let's go. Wait,

651
02:00:21,720 --> 02:00:27,180
it's locked. Why? Oh shit. I have to go in the straight line here. We've got an urgent contract

652
02:00:27,180 --> 02:00:31,180
for you. Local fuel company is building a pipeline and just hired us as a subcontractor.

653
02:00:31,180 --> 02:00:39,479
Deliver everything they need fast. I need service spare parts times two. Okay. Service spare parts

654
02:00:39,479 --> 02:00:46,420
times two. You have to go through the tunnel that connects locations to reach your target destination.

655
02:00:47,220 --> 02:00:53,140
So service spare parts are here at the service hub. And then we have to go to the pipeline thing.

656
02:00:54,869 --> 02:01:06,840
All right. Let's go. I'm ready. Buy and sell trailers. All right. Wait, I need something.

657
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:15,909
How am I going to put oil barrels on here? All-wheel drive is always on on this thing.

658
02:01:23,659 --> 02:01:32,119
I need a trailer. Put them on the seats. Just put them in the back seat. That's very slippery.

659
02:01:32,119 --> 02:01:50,539
This is very slippery. Maybe I should get the big thing. I wonder if I can pull them with the

660
02:01:50,539 --> 02:02:02,020
winch. Does this thing have a winch? Yeah, I got to put snow tires on here. I have no idea what's

661
02:02:02,020 --> 02:02:17,859
on here right now. Uh, this seems to do okay in the snow. This is important. Press one for auto.

662
02:02:18,420 --> 02:02:31,689
Oh, he's not even in here. Oh, this is the first person. Cool. All right. Service spare parts.

663
02:02:31,689 --> 02:02:51,609
I can load it. What do I get out of this view? Two, one. Oh, load. I can't load it. Shit. Well,

664
02:02:51,609 --> 02:03:08,649
hold on. Yeah, I can't put it on here. What is this? Your task are small additional objectives

665
02:03:08,649 --> 02:03:13,319
that will often make your life easier. What opportunity to earn money that discover when

666
02:03:13,319 --> 02:03:18,699
exploring the world. All right. What is this task? Name's Pete. I work for a transport company called

667
02:03:18,699 --> 02:03:23,420
Alaskan Transit. We've had an unfortunate accident that's resulted in containers of tools stuck in

668
02:03:23,420 --> 02:03:33,510
the river. Can you locate them and get them to the base? Yeah, sure. Yeah, I need it. I need a

669
02:03:33,510 --> 02:03:39,539
bigger car. I'm going to take the big thing. I have an important question. Do you freeze your bread?

670
02:03:40,340 --> 02:03:47,909
I don't. I mean, if you buy more than one loaf at a time, I guess maybe you could do that, right?

671
02:03:47,909 --> 02:04:06,869
I don't freeze my bread. Let's go to the garage. There's a trailer here. All right. I'm ready. I

672
02:04:06,869 --> 02:04:10,069
freeze my bread. Yeah, it lasts longer. But if you're going to eat it, if you know you're going to

673
02:04:10,069 --> 02:04:28,229
eat a loaf of bread in a week or two, why would you freeze it? It's for the crunch. So it's crisp.

674
02:04:31,100 --> 02:04:36,420
Why are you eating crispy bread? Are you talking about like toasting it? Why does it need to be

675
02:04:36,420 --> 02:04:44,420
crunchy? When you toast it, wouldn't it? The moisture kind of be weird. I don't know. I feel

676
02:04:44,420 --> 02:05:06,140
like it would just start dripping water. Where's the garage? It evaporates. It doesn't. I just did

677
02:05:06,140 --> 02:05:23,939
it. It's a little dry though. Yeah. No, I'm not freezing my bread. No, thanks. I'm taking the big

678
02:05:23,939 --> 02:05:29,930
thing. I'm going to put some new tires on it. I'm going to sell some shit too. Why not? All right.

679
02:05:29,930 --> 02:05:39,079
Truck storage. Which one of these do I not give a shit about? This one's awesome. This one's really

680
02:05:39,079 --> 02:05:52,069
cool. This one's ugly. Oh, wait, hold on. Highway mud tires, all-terrain. All right. This is the

681
02:05:52,069 --> 02:06:00,390
mud. This is the one that I can, is going to be good for the snow. This one is a highway car.

682
02:06:01,189 --> 02:06:16,810
It says all-wheel drive switchable. This is worth $40,000. I'm selling it. Now I've got $40,000.

683
02:06:16,810 --> 02:06:28,300
All right. Let's go like this. Customize it. I'm just gonna, I got to go too crazy here. Tires.

684
02:06:28,300 --> 02:06:34,630
Here we go. What does it have right now? This is on-road, off-road. Mud is average,

685
02:06:34,630 --> 02:06:43,460
which would be snow too, wouldn't it? On-road, poor. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Keep this. Who cares

686
02:06:43,460 --> 02:06:58,789
about on-road? Yeah. Definitely keep these on. Okay. Get a snorkel on here. Saddle high. Roof

687
02:06:58,789 --> 02:07:03,750
rack. A roof-mounted trunk carrying supplies, fuel, and some basic repair tools. Oh yeah. Let's go.

688
02:07:06,859 --> 02:07:20,710
Sideboard bed. High saddle. Yeah. And give me the bed. This looks pretty good. All right. Rooftop.

689
02:07:21,350 --> 02:07:35,260
What does one even mean? 1X. All right. That's good. Front bumper. Solaneous. I like the orange.

690
02:07:35,260 --> 02:07:55,670
No, I don't. Big horns. What is this DLC? It's a bowl. No, I like the, like this one.

691
02:07:56,229 --> 02:08:16,199
Can you change tires? I could. Get auto in there. And then, um, where is it? Mud. And then we put

692
02:08:16,199 --> 02:08:29,739
the mud monster here. And then mud up. Mud up or shut up. Hide the fire. Looks good to me.

693
02:08:35,529 --> 02:08:45,590
I don't think I can do chain tires. Yeah. They're not unlocked. These would be good for now. All

694
02:08:45,590 --> 02:09:03,960
right. Let's try it. Uh, what the hell? That was weird. Now, should I get? I have a couple things

695
02:09:03,960 --> 02:09:08,659
going on here. Let's do the, uh, okay. I want to do the pipe thing. Let's go to the service hub.

696
02:09:08,659 --> 02:09:12,489
Let's just do, let's get this out of the way. And then where's this other thing that has the

697
02:09:12,489 --> 02:09:20,920
parts in the river or something? Containers in the river. Yeah. This one. Oh shit. It's right here.

698
02:09:20,920 --> 02:09:25,340
Perfect. All right. All right. Now let's really actually move. Let's go.

699
02:09:25,979 --> 02:09:48,300
Where are those markers I just put? All right. This has got a all wheel drive too. Doesn't it?

700
02:09:48,300 --> 02:10:00,970
Oh yeah. It does. This thing is a monster. There's an Easter egg. If you hit 80 miles per

701
02:10:00,970 --> 02:10:23,859
hour with this truck, which way should I go? Stay on the road. It's so distracting. It's too

702
02:10:23,859 --> 02:10:37,850
dark. You're being unsafe. Well, I'm just trying to. How do I turn the headlights on?

703
02:10:41,100 --> 02:10:57,319
I don't know how to turn the headlights on. H L B plus B. Oh God. I can see. I haven't been able

704
02:10:57,319 --> 02:11:02,279
to see this whole time in the dark. I was like, it sucks being out at night. You can't do anything.

705
02:11:10,170 --> 02:11:18,979
All right. Here's the parts. We have a spare parts loaded up. Looks good. Deliver those parts.

706
02:11:19,619 --> 02:11:37,939
You're playing with a controller. Omega lull. Yeah. Why? Wait, you.

707
02:11:38,579 --> 02:11:44,550
Why would you want to play this game without a controller? W A S D in the mouse does not

708
02:11:44,550 --> 02:11:49,829
translate well to car movement. It just doesn't. It's not a natural turning of the wheel motion.

709
02:11:50,710 --> 02:12:05,300
Like being able to actually have a stick move left, right up. A D no. And the trigger is almost

710
02:12:05,300 --> 02:12:11,300
like a gas pedal. It's like step on the gas, not pressing W with like your index finger. It has

711
02:12:11,300 --> 02:12:16,010
like a little bit of resistance. It's like pulling, stepping on the gas. All right. What

712
02:12:16,010 --> 02:12:21,210
do I need to do first? All right. I need to deliver these to the pipeline, but wait,

713
02:12:23,479 --> 02:12:35,720
uh, I gotta go here first. They're everything. We're going this way. Let's go. Oh, there's a

714
02:12:35,720 --> 02:12:54,899
watch tower right here. Do you get the watch tower first? Are you going to get the steam

715
02:12:54,899 --> 02:13:04,329
upper decker? I don't, I, are you talking about the steam, uh, game pad like switch thing?

716
02:13:05,369 --> 02:13:08,409
I don't know why you're calling it an upper decker. Like you taking a shit in somebody's

717
02:13:08,409 --> 02:13:13,050
tank in their bathroom. What do you, why up? Why are you calling it an upper decker? That's

718
02:13:13,050 --> 02:13:23,020
freaking me out. Are you calling it that? Hey dude, you're going to take an upper decker

719
02:13:23,020 --> 02:13:38,260
in the steam box? Um, I know. Why did you say upper decker? I need to know what you mean.

720
02:13:40,760 --> 02:13:52,739
It's called the steam deck. Yeah, but a steam upper deck. I just imagine a guy playing that

721
02:13:52,739 --> 02:14:00,380
thing on the toilet. And like, that's why you called it that because he's taking a shit playing

722
02:14:00,380 --> 02:14:08,729
the steam deck. It's being correlated that way. I'm like, yeah, no, no, it's nothing wrong way.

723
02:14:08,729 --> 02:14:14,279
I was terrified to go this way because it was weird. I'm going to go this way. I'm going to,

724
02:14:14,279 --> 02:14:33,909
I'm trying to go on the actual road up for a decker. Here we go. All right. I just want to

725
02:14:33,909 --> 02:14:47,130
get the tower. Shit. This is supposed to be good in the off road. I hope I don't get stuck. This

726
02:14:47,130 --> 02:14:59,560
is half a winch. Thank God. Blow it down. I'm in deep, deep snow right now. But to answer the

727
02:14:59,560 --> 02:15:09,479
question, I, well, I don't know. I might get the steam upper decker. No, I'm good. I can move.

728
02:15:10,039 --> 02:15:22,359
It depends. It really depends on that thing. If it has a game gear battery or not,

729
02:15:26,300 --> 02:15:41,109
like if that thing doesn't last from a Vegas to LA plane ride, I don't want it. If lock was H

730
02:15:46,520 --> 02:15:54,250
if law, they didn't teach me that. What's a diff lock. I heard it lasts about

731
02:15:54,250 --> 02:16:03,029
four to nine hours on depending on load L B Y. Div log is only available on low gear.

732
02:16:05,420 --> 02:16:08,060
Is this, should I have these both on whenever I'm trying to go through rough terrain?

733
02:16:11,449 --> 02:16:15,689
So this turns this thing into like a tank, right? Like treads. I have no idea what this does,

734
02:16:16,329 --> 02:16:20,039
but holy shit. I'm about to go up a hill. This is not going to happen.

735
02:16:24,140 --> 02:16:45,780
I don't think this is going to happen. Very concerned about this. Okay. All right. Didn't

736
02:16:45,780 --> 02:16:59,799
even give this truck a chance. All right. Left or right? Uh, right. Hopefully. I hope I don't get

737
02:16:59,799 --> 02:17:08,579
killed here. This is a comfy game. I did want my first screen back from the dollhouse to be,

738
02:17:08,579 --> 02:17:16,459
to be like a comfy stream. I mean, hang out, man. I got to turn off this lock because I can't move.

739
02:17:20,760 --> 02:17:24,780
Well, it looks like we're going this way because I can't turn the tires.

740
02:17:25,340 --> 02:17:45,780
This is stressing me out. I mean, it's kind of, it's, it's not a high stress. I feel like we're

741
02:17:45,780 --> 02:17:51,270
going to get a probably a high stress few streams this weekend because I'm starting no more heroes

742
02:17:51,270 --> 02:17:58,819
three. Probably did that on, I want to, I don't know, Saturday started on Saturday because I

743
02:17:58,819 --> 02:18:09,620
really do want to go back to being on the weekends again. How am I going to get that? I, am I going

744
02:18:09,620 --> 02:18:20,040
to activate this? Whatever I'm going for. I don't care. I just have to get, get close enough.

745
02:18:30,469 --> 02:18:48,629
Careful. I'm going to be careful. Did I cliff? No. Hope I can get out of this. All right. Unlock it.

746
02:18:48,629 --> 02:18:57,379
Come on. Yeah. We'll be going back to Saturday, Sunday streams, Friday, Saturday, Saturday,

747
02:18:58,180 --> 02:19:01,540
one or two times a week depending on what we're doing. Uh, we're at, we're going to have to do

748
02:19:01,540 --> 02:19:21,020
at least two streams in a row because of no more heroes. God, what is all this? Where am I? Oh,

749
02:19:21,020 --> 02:19:32,620
what? Oh, I'm up here. Cargo container. I can't get this right now. All right. Shit. I need to do

750
02:19:32,620 --> 02:19:36,940
this. This, this was worth a lot of money. All right. I know what I'm doing. I'm dumping the

751
02:19:36,940 --> 02:19:48,780
cargo here and I'm going to pick this up because I need these two. Yep. Okay. I need to get these

752
02:19:48,780 --> 02:20:00,649
two things. This thing not back up. Let's go to the pipeline. No, no, no, no. What do you mean?

753
02:20:00,649 --> 02:20:06,170
Why, why, why? I need a crane. Oh shit. Okay. Can I, am I just going to break if I drive across this

754
02:20:06,170 --> 02:20:19,000
thing? I feel like this is a rickety ass bridge. I am scared of going over this. How much do I

755
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:33,290
weigh? Like 40,000 pounds. This doesn't look sturdy at all. I think this is a good idea.

756
02:20:40,149 --> 02:20:58,139
Easy. Okay. I'm on it. All right. Turns out it was safe. Now I got to get out to the road here. Can I

757
02:20:58,139 --> 02:21:01,739
just drive straight? All right. Straight. And then we're going to go up here where the, the pipe

758
02:21:01,739 --> 02:21:22,549
things are. All right. Let's go. Get out. It was a 27 point turn. Yeah. Well, when you're in,

759
02:21:23,270 --> 02:21:27,750
when you're in like an original Burger King chicken sandwich length car, you have to be

760
02:21:27,750 --> 02:22:02,420
fucking careful. Oh, I want one of those now. So bad. Am I doing this right? Is there, was there

761
02:22:02,420 --> 02:22:41,860
a tree? You can't just pull, just pull me through the, just go. What the hell? I can't see anything.

762
02:22:41,860 --> 02:22:56,299
Why did I go this way? What the fuck am I doing? I can't, why would I drive through the woods?

763
02:22:57,100 --> 02:23:16,139
What the hell am I thinking? It's so dark. Go to bed. Just wake up in like an hour. Come on,

764
02:23:16,139 --> 02:23:48,299
back up. Back up. Back up. Oh, what a comfy stream. I'm working on it. Pull. Come on. It's so close.

765
02:23:55,620 --> 02:24:01,979
All right. Pull me this way. There we go. All right. Stop. This is a great view actually. Keep

766
02:24:01,979 --> 02:24:29,670
this view. Shit. No, I can't see. Is this a tree over here? No, it is a tree. I didn't even load in

767
02:24:29,670 --> 02:24:37,350
my game. Fuck. No. There's a tree on every side. This is the worst possible thing I could have done.

768
02:24:38,069 --> 02:24:45,940
This is the worst possible thing I could have done. Oh my God. I think I have to pull myself

769
02:24:45,940 --> 02:25:05,530
backwards. Fuck. Hold on. I think I'm okay. Wait. Hold on. There's a spot right here.

770
02:25:38,329 --> 02:25:47,829
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn. Strain it out is the opportunity right here. Make sure the tires

771
02:25:47,829 --> 02:26:00,870
are straight. Go. Yeah. Stop. I can't see anything. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

772
02:26:00,870 --> 02:26:12,620
Where's the road? I'm not even halfway. I turned around. How did I turn around? I'm facing this way

773
02:26:12,620 --> 02:26:22,889
now. How? What? I don't understand. What are you talking about? I didn't turn around. I've been

774
02:26:22,889 --> 02:26:30,780
going the same direction the whole time. You put these mirrors down. Hold on. Settle down. Relax.

775
02:26:30,780 --> 02:26:37,190
Not a big deal. No, I'm going the right way. Why is it looking like that?

776
02:26:39,959 --> 02:26:54,389
All right. Attach. I have to pull myself this way. I feel like I was playing Madden. I wanted to

777
02:26:54,389 --> 02:26:58,790
select the guy all the way to the right so I could run and try to fucking kill the quarterback.

778
02:26:58,790 --> 02:27:08,819
That's what I did every time. Every play. I've got to take a hard right. That's what I'm going for.

779
02:27:09,540 --> 02:27:19,059
There it is. Okay. There's an opening. All right. I'm going to get through here.

780
02:27:19,700 --> 02:27:26,500
There we go. Just go right through the needle right here. Where's the next tree?

781
02:27:27,219 --> 02:27:47,799
It's right in front of that, isn't it? Which way are the tires turning? Looks like a pretty

782
02:27:47,799 --> 02:28:04,940
straight shot right here. No, there's a bump. There's a bump, but give me the first person.

783
02:28:05,829 --> 02:28:25,239
Oh shit. Okay. Hold on. All right. Okay. Straight ahead. Straight ahead. Fuck. All right. Now what?

784
02:28:25,239 --> 02:28:31,079
I think I can just go straight. I need the first person is probably better here.

785
02:28:39,899 --> 02:28:55,899
You see a road yet? Where's the road? Is that an opening? All right. Listen. I'm going to. Okay.

786
02:28:55,899 --> 02:29:13,979
Careful. This is the dumbest thing I've ever done. I don't know why I did this. I could have

787
02:29:13,979 --> 02:29:23,639
reset 20 minutes ago. All right. We're going to turn this way and pull it. No, wrong way. Good.

788
02:29:24,540 --> 02:29:43,110
Good. Okay. Now I got a shot this way. Is this ever going to end? I'm trying to go this way.

789
02:29:45,260 --> 02:29:50,459
Fucking God. I give up, I think. It's time to give up. It's time to give up. I'm facing. I've

790
02:29:50,459 --> 02:30:00,069
given up. I don't think I can do this. I need to keep a marker here. Delete all markers and put one

791
02:30:00,069 --> 02:30:10,700
right here. My God. I've made it harder. I was here and I could have just gone this way and now

792
02:30:10,700 --> 02:30:18,299
I have to go through this. What happened? I'm so confused how I did this. What did I think was

793
02:30:18,299 --> 02:30:24,780
going to happen? I'm so distraught. I don't understand. Okay. Settle down. I'm going to get

794
02:30:24,780 --> 02:30:27,899
through this shit. You and me. We're going to be, we're going to get through this together.

795
02:30:29,799 --> 02:30:40,899
Oh, he doesn't even know, dude. Hold on. First and 10. 40 yard line. Okay. Got a, huh.

796
02:30:41,459 --> 02:30:55,139
Sprint. Tackle. Tackle. I don't care. Come off sides. Heard a, did I break it? What happened

797
02:30:55,139 --> 02:31:03,700
to the winch? Winch is okay. I got to, if I just go straight from here, don't be an idiot. Here we

798
02:31:03,700 --> 02:31:12,100
go. Oh, by the way, every time I played Madden, I just selected the safety every time and we're

799
02:31:12,100 --> 02:31:17,139
just running around with them. By the way, I think some of you may have like not been here when I

800
02:31:17,139 --> 02:31:21,059
talked about how my brother and I used to play and I would lose like a hundred plus points to zero.

801
02:31:23,100 --> 02:31:34,440
I would just throw Hail Mary's and miss every time. Okay. I think I can back up and recalibrate

802
02:31:34,440 --> 02:31:44,219
this and just go this way. God, what am I doing? All right. I'm going to go to the right. It looks

803
02:31:44,219 --> 02:31:49,739
like an opportunity to go to the right side here. No, it doesn't. I'm fucked. I'm just restart the

804
02:31:49,739 --> 02:32:01,770
game. I have to restart it. There's no coming away from this. I'm never going to get out of here.

805
02:32:03,610 --> 02:32:12,340
I have to go that way. Waiter. All right. Fine. I'll, I'll get, I'll do it. We're going to,

806
02:32:12,340 --> 02:32:16,260
I'm going to lose like two, 3000 viewers. I'm going to lose like 10,000 of you, but I'm going

807
02:32:16,260 --> 02:32:29,510
to go for it. As long as I can turn the wheel. There we go. All right. Keep going. Now if I go

808
02:32:29,510 --> 02:32:36,329
to the right. Yeah. Okay. This will be all right. I need to pull in a different direction though,

809
02:32:36,329 --> 02:32:42,120
because I don't want to get too close to this tree. We're going to pull this way. We're going

810
02:32:42,120 --> 02:32:44,680
to grab one of these trees over here on the right. This one here probably will do it.

811
02:32:48,629 --> 02:33:06,709
Uh, no, easy. Is it even attached? What is it doing? What does it even attach to? Um, what the

812
02:33:06,709 --> 02:33:30,090
hell? Pull it. God, let it go. Come here. This one back here. Oh, hold me. No, no, don't. Okay. I'm

813
02:33:30,090 --> 02:33:36,299
fine. Don't back into that tree. Now we're going to pull it this way. Let it go. I'm going to grab

814
02:33:36,299 --> 02:33:41,610
this side here. That's closest. This one right here. I'm going to grab this tree back here. Pull

815
02:33:41,610 --> 02:33:56,780
it. Where'd it go? You're not in reverse. Oh, hold on. I got to grab the tree on the right.

816
02:34:07,780 --> 02:34:24,250
Come on, dude. Come on. Now we're going to back up. Back up. I'm so screwed here. I don't think this

817
02:34:24,250 --> 02:34:39,299
is going to happen. The Venga bus is coming. So the poor video game in-game character has not

818
02:34:39,299 --> 02:34:51,290
eaten and you just have him stuck here. Okay. I obviously can't go that way. I'm going to try

819
02:34:51,290 --> 02:34:55,049
something different. Oh, that's the definition of insanity is trying the same thing without

820
02:34:55,049 --> 02:34:58,969
the same results happening. They keep going. You keep doing the same thing with the same results

821
02:34:58,969 --> 02:35:21,819
happening. All right. I figured it out. I got it. I wasn't in reverse the whole time. Now this

822
02:35:21,819 --> 02:35:28,149
will make sense. Just wait. I'll get out of this. Don't worry. Everyone can relax. Look, I know you

823
02:35:28,149 --> 02:35:32,299
guys are making like dinner or something anyways. Hold your residence sleepers till I get out of

824
02:35:32,299 --> 02:35:35,500
this. Well, actually, no, go ahead. You go to sleep. I'll wake you up. I promise.

825
02:35:48,549 --> 02:35:56,299
He's just smashing the horn. Stop hitting the horn, dude. I don't know if I can get out of here.

826
02:35:56,299 --> 02:36:06,360
I don't think I can get out of here. Fuck. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You know what? It's probably

827
02:36:06,360 --> 02:36:11,799
just going to be easier if I just drive this way. You know what I mean? Like, watch this.

828
02:36:13,110 --> 02:36:17,590
It's going to be. I'm just going to turn the whole fucking car around. I'm angry at this point.

829
02:36:18,229 --> 02:36:37,979
Watch this. Ah, ah, ah, ah. Got it. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All

830
02:36:37,979 --> 02:36:40,219
right. All right. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Don't do anything stupid.

831
02:36:40,219 --> 02:37:12,260
Here we go. Drive. Oh my God. Drive the car. Boys and girls, we got it. I'm ready. Everything's good

832
02:37:12,260 --> 02:37:29,770
to go. Here it is. There's our exit right there. Nice and easy. Back it up again. We're still

833
02:37:29,770 --> 02:37:53,459
fucked. And no, we're not. Look at that straight shot right there. You see it? Here we go. Come on.

834
02:37:53,459 --> 02:37:58,440
Nice and easy. Just thread, thread, thread, thread, thread. All right. Left or right?

835
02:37:59,079 --> 02:38:21,370
I'm going to say stay right. Right here. Fuck. There's a tree right there. It's all right.

836
02:38:33,500 --> 02:38:46,920
It's so close. I did the same thing. Yeah. This time I'm getting out of it because look. Wait,

837
02:38:46,920 --> 02:38:51,819
I did. I did the same. Oh, no, I didn't. I did the same thing. I went to the same place. No,

838
02:38:51,819 --> 02:38:57,799
I didn't. I went to the same spot. I went to the same spot. I did go to the exact same spot.

839
02:38:57,799 --> 02:39:01,559
Oh my God. What are you? You're right. You guys are right. Okay. Holy shit. You're right.

840
02:39:02,979 --> 02:39:07,379
Oh my God. You got to be kidding me. Okay. I'm done. All right. I'm done. We're going to go this

841
02:39:07,379 --> 02:39:15,350
way. I don't know how I did that. What an idiot. What a fucking total, just absolute moron. Okay.

842
02:39:15,350 --> 02:39:39,500
I'm going to try this again. Go this way. Turn the wheels. Come on. Okay. That's this is a

843
02:39:39,500 --> 02:39:48,790
different path. There we go. I got it. Right. It's right there. I see the road. All right.

844
02:39:48,790 --> 02:39:53,590
Don't panic. Don't freak out. I think this way is the correct way. Can I fit through that?

845
02:39:53,590 --> 02:40:06,860
I think I can fit through this. Can I fit through here? I think I can fit right here. Like right

846
02:40:06,860 --> 02:40:26,549
here. Oh, fuck. Yeah. I'm almost there. Okay. Slow down. What's in front of me? Yeah. Let's go.

847
02:40:30,260 --> 02:40:41,479
I did it. Thank God. I can finally move on. Oh, it feels so good to get out of that. All right.

848
02:40:41,479 --> 02:40:53,860
Let's deliver this. Hey, Larry, you were you were like an hour late with the deployment. What

849
02:40:53,860 --> 02:41:09,579
happened? I had traffic. Oh, yeah. Traffic. I'm in Alaska. There's no cars. All right. Let's go

850
02:41:09,579 --> 02:41:26,489
tasks. This one here. I got the repair parts. Track it. Let's go. You wasted 40 gallons of fuel.

851
02:41:38,069 --> 02:41:41,110
Yeah. I want one of those long chickens from Burger King. So bad right now.

852
02:41:41,909 --> 02:42:16,139
Stay on the road. How many viewers did we lose? A thousand. They were the smart ones. Find all

853
02:42:16,139 --> 02:42:35,700
the tutorial hints. I know what I'm doing. Okay. Where do you buy the crane? Everyone keeps saying

854
02:42:35,700 --> 02:43:06,139
I need the crane for some of these other missions. I have a crane. I do. Why do you own a red sex

855
02:43:06,139 --> 02:43:15,260
t-shirt? Because somebody people made I look it was a reddit thing. I don't know. I have no idea.

856
02:43:15,260 --> 02:43:17,979
I just somebody linked me a thing where he's like, Oh, look, you're like a serial killer. And I'm

857
02:43:17,979 --> 02:43:22,700
like, Oh, okay. I laughed for a second. I was like, Oh, ha ha ha. German with a serial killer with

858
02:43:22,700 --> 02:43:27,340
the AI technology. I woke up the next day is on the front page of every reddit and people thought

859
02:43:27,340 --> 02:43:34,840
it was a real thing. And everyone just associates me with a fucking like a murderer. That's like

860
02:43:34,840 --> 02:43:41,319
50,000 upvotes on the front page. It's like I just like to close my phone. I was like, Okay, well,

861
02:43:41,319 --> 02:43:50,920
I guess we're doing that now. Alright, 1400 bucks, 180. This is now open. So this opens to

862
02:43:50,920 --> 02:44:00,680
another spot here. But I want to go. I kind of want to do that. Timber. Hi, the sawmill near

863
02:44:00,680 --> 02:44:07,479
the port is running out of wood. So we'll pay to have some delivered. Log loader crane is recommended.

864
02:44:08,040 --> 02:44:19,690
I don't have one of those though. I guess that's on the way. So again, explain to me how I get a

865
02:44:19,690 --> 02:44:29,190
crane because I don't understand. I get it here. Trailer store or something. The other car has a

866
02:44:29,190 --> 02:44:50,729
crane. Oh, okay. You don't have a crane. I hope the murderer joke at least brought attention to the

867
02:44:50,729 --> 02:45:12,340
dollhouse stream. No, I don't care. It's funny. Logging missions are kind of hard, my king.

868
02:45:13,139 --> 02:45:34,520
We'll find out. Is this the sus guy? Join me on the next stream. The imposter is sus guy plays

869
02:45:34,520 --> 02:45:52,260
werewolf. The imposter is sus guy plays mafia. I don't even play among us. Okay, let's see which

870
02:45:52,260 --> 02:46:01,370
hat would have which one of these cars has a crane. Alright, so it would say it whichable

871
02:46:02,809 --> 02:46:09,379
compatibility. How can I tell if it has a crane? I mean, that looks like a crane on top of this.

872
02:46:09,379 --> 02:46:26,260
If I was a crane, I'd be that thing, the blue thing on top, but we have to mess with it.

873
02:46:26,260 --> 02:46:33,860
I could buy something now. Can I have 30,000? You know what? Let me take a look because if I sell

874
02:46:33,860 --> 02:46:40,459
a couple of these, I can get like $50,000. What do I actually need? What should I actually buy? Oh,

875
02:46:40,459 --> 02:46:48,360
I know exactly what I want. How much is this? I don't have it unlocked. What the hell? That's

876
02:46:48,360 --> 02:47:07,049
annoying. Alright, let's customize it. Tires are fine. No, no, I want mud. I don't have anything

877
02:47:07,049 --> 02:47:16,709
unlocked for these. That's not good. What is it currently using? What's the difference? Get the

878
02:47:16,709 --> 02:47:33,049
freeze. Fine, I guess. Mud pour. That's not good. Okay, well, whatever. Oh, geez. Oh, geez. Alright,

879
02:47:33,049 --> 02:47:42,600
there's the crane. Is there a better crane? Nah, keep the crane on. That's what I'm using it for.

880
02:47:42,600 --> 02:48:11,610
I like that. Twisted metal is like missiles. I like that. I like that. I want it to be like a fire

881
02:48:11,610 --> 02:48:27,270
engine. Yeah, that's better. Alright, cool. Let's go pick up those things. So now how do I use the

882
02:48:27,350 --> 02:48:35,989
crane? I'm sure we'll find out. Alright, we need to go down here. This is worth like

883
02:48:35,989 --> 02:48:42,569
three or four thousand dollars or something crazy. This car is way too big to go in the woods,

884
02:48:42,569 --> 02:48:54,680
so don't worry, I'm not gonna do that. Let's go this way. I'm gonna have to just kind of go around

885
02:48:54,680 --> 02:49:01,479
here and up this way, I guess. It's really the only way I can really go besides here, but is

886
02:49:01,479 --> 02:49:10,709
this water? I don't think I can drive through this. That's definitely the better way to go,

887
02:49:10,709 --> 02:49:18,069
but I don't know how deep that is. Is it ice or water? Let's try it. I'll give it a try.

888
02:49:18,069 --> 02:49:29,370
This thing's terrible in mud. We'll find out. I'm gonna turn around if I don't want it.

889
02:49:29,930 --> 02:49:39,959
I don't want to do it. That's a scary horn. That's the kind of horn that makes you just

890
02:49:39,959 --> 02:49:47,239
jump at the red light. That's the kind of horn that gives you a stomach ache. It's just so st-

891
02:49:50,870 --> 02:50:02,739
shit. It's okay. Is it ice or is it water? It looks like- I don't know. What? It's ice? Alright,

892
02:50:02,739 --> 02:50:20,409
it's ice. I'll be alright. I have no control over this car. I just held left on the stick as hard

893
02:50:20,409 --> 02:50:54,059
as I could. Oh lord, hold on. Wait, this is always on? This is ice. That's fine. Face cam,

894
02:50:54,059 --> 02:51:04,809
good sir. You've earned five minutes of face cam. I'm gonna have to blink my eyes a bunch.

895
02:51:04,809 --> 02:51:18,219
What a great time to turn it on when I'm like- I just realized I haven't blinked in an hour

896
02:51:18,219 --> 02:51:27,690
and my eyes are watering. Yeah, my eyes are full of water right now. Anybody else have really

897
02:51:27,690 --> 02:51:33,129
watery, liquidy eyes? My eyes seem to be so watery all the time. If I go outside and it's windy out,

898
02:51:34,549 --> 02:51:42,700
at all, tears will just be streaming down my face, down my cheeks. I've got very sensitive

899
02:51:42,700 --> 02:52:05,450
eyes. Pinching your nipples helps with- I'm not even gonna finish the sentence. I think I can-

900
02:52:05,450 --> 02:52:12,889
no, keep it on. I don't wanna get stuck. No, I don't need to. It's not that deep. This thing's

901
02:52:12,889 --> 02:52:22,659
pretty good in off mud terrain. You're a lizard. You just lick them. I am like a lizard mouth. I'm

902
02:52:22,659 --> 02:52:29,819
always like kind of moistening my lips. I'm always going like this. I always bite my lip and I was

903
02:52:29,819 --> 02:52:39,750
like like this. If I could lick my eyes with my tongue, I probably would do it. It'd be like-

904
02:52:41,110 --> 02:52:55,260
happened all the time. Capstick Charlie, yeah. We're getting there. I'm not going that way.

905
02:52:56,200 --> 02:53:18,069
You're a fucking freak. Hey, I still don't have any gray hairs. Not that that like means anything

906
02:53:18,069 --> 02:53:22,229
for what you just said. I don't know why. I was like flexing on you for some reason. Like,

907
02:53:22,229 --> 02:53:25,430
oh yeah. Well, you ever think of a freak? I don't have any gray- I don't know. It didn't really

908
02:53:25,430 --> 02:53:33,500
correlate together, but whatever. I turn 36 really soon and I don't have any gray hairs.

909
02:53:34,139 --> 02:53:42,969
You dye your hair. I don't dye my hair. I'm afraid of dying my hair. I feel like it's gonna fall out.

910
02:53:55,530 --> 02:54:04,299
What about one? It already is falling out. Yeah, I know it is. It is. I can't stop that. It's called

911
02:54:04,299 --> 02:54:10,440
age. All the garlic and radishes. Don't eat too much garlic. Don't eat too many radishes.

912
02:54:11,079 --> 02:54:13,450
Only eat them when you feel like you want a snack.

913
02:54:16,299 --> 02:54:22,180
Don't do the YouTuber quirky hair color thing. I- I'm not gonna do the YouTuber

914
02:54:22,180 --> 02:54:26,979
quirky hair color thing. Don't worry. I'm not gonna do like the hair color YouTuber thing.

915
02:54:32,579 --> 02:54:40,899
Garlic snack? Yeah, well not- maybe not nowadays, but like, I don't know,

916
02:54:40,899 --> 02:54:45,379
George Washington used to like rub garlic on his feet to like cure his fucking cold.

917
02:54:46,180 --> 02:54:54,069
You know, you know, garlic has something called allicin in it. It's actually really good for you.

918
02:54:54,069 --> 02:54:58,309
When you crush garlic and it stinks, you're actually smelling the chemical reaction to

919
02:54:58,309 --> 02:55:07,100
create allicin. It's very, very good for you. Hey, look it up. That's fine. It's all right.

920
02:55:07,100 --> 02:55:11,100
I'll be the smartest one in the room today. Maybe not every day, but maybe today I will be.

921
02:55:16,729 --> 02:55:26,549
No, A-L-I-C-I-N. Not like A-L-I-S-O-N. That's suedo science. It's not. It's like documented

922
02:55:26,549 --> 02:55:41,899
fucking proof. All right, let's go. You went to the wrong place? No, I didn't. Yeah, I did.

923
02:55:42,700 --> 02:55:57,020
Do I need a crane to pick up the logs? Timber. Log loader crane is recommended. All right,

924
02:55:57,020 --> 02:56:41,959
well let's- I'm gonna get them I guess. Let's pick them up. What? Okay. All right. Anchor. Okay. How

925
02:56:41,959 --> 02:57:15,399
do I pick it up? Attach cargo. How do I attach it? Pick it up. Attach cargo. It's the wrong crane.

926
02:57:15,399 --> 02:57:21,829
Whatever. I need a logging crane for the logs. Fine. I'm just gonna go do the- I'm gonna-

927
02:57:22,469 --> 02:57:44,149
We were talking and so I didn't pay attention. Back on the road. Let's go. Come on. Get fired?

928
02:57:44,149 --> 02:58:02,440
I'm not. Put this shit away. I'm gonna fix your shit. I just did. How do you drive with

929
02:58:02,440 --> 02:58:18,139
passengers in the car without getting lost? That's what GPS is for. Garlic's really good for you

930
02:58:18,139 --> 02:58:26,340
though. I would say you should add some more- Well, hold on. I'll hit this thing. Garlic is very,

931
02:58:26,340 --> 02:58:32,549
very harsh for some people. You know, if you have acid reflux problems, if you're trying to do like

932
02:58:32,549 --> 02:58:37,590
kind of like a low FODMAP diet, if you have irritable bowel kind of problems, you don't

933
02:58:37,590 --> 02:58:41,750
really want to eat too much of it. But if you can handle it, it's really, really good for you.

934
02:58:51,639 --> 02:59:02,760
It's for vampires. They have a garlic burger at Burger King. I don't think I want that. I want-

935
02:59:02,760 --> 02:59:09,190
I like fresh garlic. Garlic that's fresh, smashed, and immediately used either to put in the pan

936
02:59:09,190 --> 02:59:17,190
or like garlic bread or something. I don't- No. Give me the real stuff. I want the real stuff. I

937
02:59:17,190 --> 02:59:22,180
don't want the fake shit. I'm not saying that it's fake whatever they use at Burger King or

938
02:59:22,180 --> 02:59:25,940
whatever, but it's not the real shit. It doesn't- They don't smash it in the fucking restaurant.

939
02:59:27,159 --> 02:59:37,319
What happened? Why don't you grow fresh garlic? I don't know. I never really thought to.

940
02:59:38,040 --> 02:59:54,870
I'm not saying it's fake. I'm just saying it's not real. No, I just- It's not- It's real. It's not

941
02:59:54,870 --> 03:00:00,069
fresh. Fresh squeezed, fresh pressed at the restaurant. Like somebody just smashes it

942
03:00:00,069 --> 03:00:03,110
with a knife and like smashes it with a knife. You know, you turn the knife sideways and you

943
03:00:03,110 --> 03:00:06,389
smash. Spread, spread, spread, spread, smash. Spread, spread, spread, spread, spread.

944
03:00:06,389 --> 03:00:09,989
Sink, sink, sink, sink, smash. Spread, spread, spread. You know what I'm talking about?

945
03:00:09,989 --> 03:00:17,530
That's what I do. Where are we going? All right. Don't be an idiot. All right. I gotta go right.

946
03:00:17,530 --> 03:00:35,540
Hey, watch the road, buddy. I'm fine. This is the second time I've heard you rant about garlic

947
03:00:35,540 --> 03:00:41,209
because I find it to be an incredibly important addition to your diet. Your armpits smell like

948
03:00:41,209 --> 03:00:47,290
garlic. They do. All of you- Okay. Here's the thing. Garlic like permeates every inch of your

949
03:00:47,290 --> 03:00:52,889
body. It like crosses your like brain barrier and it like goes through all your pores, right?

950
03:00:53,610 --> 03:00:58,649
From what I've read. I don't know how true it is. So that's- If you eat garlic, you smell like

951
03:00:58,649 --> 03:01:09,479
garlic. Especially if you eat a lot of it. Don't eat too much of it. Don't eat too much. You shouldn't

952
03:01:09,479 --> 03:01:26,389
be eating too much of it anyways. This dude's got garlic brain? That's what I've heard. Garlic just

953
03:01:26,389 --> 03:01:31,829
permeates like every single like cell in your body. You become more garlic than person when you eat

954
03:01:31,829 --> 03:01:43,030
it. It's garlic science. It's suede of science. I don't know. Let me just pick up my boxes. Okay.

955
03:01:43,030 --> 03:02:01,559
Here we go. Activate anchor. Get that crane out. Catch the crane. All right. Lift it up. Why is-

956
03:02:01,559 --> 03:02:08,200
Why am I moving? Why am I moving? Anchor, anchor, anchor, anchor, anchor in the ground. Anchor. Let

957
03:02:08,200 --> 03:02:22,520
it go. What's happening? What's wrong with me? Put the handbrake on? Oh shit. You're right. Okay.

958
03:02:32,940 --> 03:03:11,059
How do I get this in the bed? I can only put one of these at a time? Can I stack them? Oh my god.

959
03:03:12,260 --> 03:03:39,670
I don't even know where this is going. Just fucking sleep. Thank you. Actually that's better. I can

960
03:03:39,670 --> 03:04:02,659
get it right in the middle. Okay. Can I drop it now? Wait. Lower it down. It's almost in there.

961
03:04:02,659 --> 03:04:13,350
All right. That's in. That's in. All right. There's one. Nice. Okay. Let's get the other one.

962
03:04:13,350 --> 03:04:37,450
How high can I lift this? Let's see how high I can get this first. That can go pretty high actually.

963
03:04:37,450 --> 03:05:23,579
This might work. It's kind of hard to tell which direction. Okay. No. There we go. That's better.

964
03:05:23,579 --> 03:05:47,049
Almost there. It's actually on. Don't. Garlic brain. The fucking face cam's staying on fine.

965
03:05:47,049 --> 03:06:27,700
How's that for garlic brain motherfuckers? How's that for garlic brain motherfuckers? D. Where's

966
03:06:27,700 --> 03:06:58,069
this going? Where's this going? Where does it go? What mission is this? Bottom left? Log station? No,

967
03:06:58,069 --> 03:07:02,090
no. That's not the right one. Deliver to the sawmill. Medium logs. Why is that being tracked?

968
03:07:02,090 --> 03:07:12,739
I don't want that. It's the wrong one. It was like it was up at the garage. Yep. Okay. Here it is.

969
03:07:12,739 --> 03:07:18,219
No, it's not. What was it? There it is. Okay. Here it is. Here. Here. Here. Containers in the river.

970
03:07:18,219 --> 03:07:28,100
Okay. So I need to get over here. Back out to the road. If I pulled this off,

971
03:07:28,100 --> 03:07:59,989
this is a huge deal for me. Get off. Get off. No more. I didn't think it was going to happen

972
03:07:59,989 --> 03:08:11,479
immediately. No. I was so ready. Wait. God damn it. I was like, if I was slow, if I was actually slow

973
03:08:11,479 --> 03:08:19,610
enough, I was just not centered. God damn it. I'm so pissed. I can't believe it. It's because I

974
03:08:19,610 --> 03:08:23,129
turned the face cam off. Yeah. Cause I was like, so I don't want to even look at me. Don't look at my

975
03:08:23,129 --> 03:08:29,829
face. Nobody look at me. Nobody look at me. Nobody look at me. Who is that? That's a character from

976
03:08:29,829 --> 03:08:38,889
like a Christmas show. What is that? I was sleeping in my class in broad daylight. That's from Heart

977
03:08:38,889 --> 03:08:43,290
of Darkness. Heart of Darkness video that I made. It was a, it might as well be. Yeah. That's what

978
03:08:43,290 --> 03:08:54,440
it is. I'm so mad that I have to do this. I'm so pissed. I really thought I was going to be able

979
03:08:54,440 --> 03:09:00,860
to do it. And you got like a Mario's ass went into the fire sound effect too. Great. Okay. Well,

980
03:09:02,059 --> 03:09:15,420
I guess we're going to recover. Aye, aye, aye. Just leave Alaska. No, I have to do that.

981
03:09:18,409 --> 03:09:21,770
I'm going to get these because like, I'm not going to let it just fucking beat me. I'm sorry.

982
03:09:30,739 --> 03:09:43,579
Sleeping in my class in broad daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight. There it is. Enable aye,

983
03:09:43,579 --> 03:09:55,940
aye, aye. Is it like 2017 again? Like is it 2016? What are you talking about? Oh, this is actually

984
03:09:55,940 --> 03:10:04,149
really important. Have I, have I ever done the record scratch Aaron thing? I've been working on

985
03:10:04,149 --> 03:10:25,459
it for a while. So I've done it, right? I have. Yep. Good. All right. Just making sure. If you're

986
03:10:25,459 --> 03:10:33,319
going to play No More Heroes 3, aye, aye, aye is crucial. It's not. Yes, I didn't. I feel like I

987
03:10:33,319 --> 03:11:03,819
did. You haven't. I haven't? Someone that goes. I've never done that. Well, now I have. So now you

988
03:11:03,819 --> 03:11:11,399
can remember it. You've done that before. I'm sure I have. Yeah. What are you guys talking about?

989
03:11:12,040 --> 03:11:17,350
Remember, you don't have to spend a hundred thousand dollars to entertain us.

990
03:11:24,459 --> 03:12:04,819
Well, about that. You got the price wrong. That was a dad laugh. I said this in the pre-stream

991
03:12:04,819 --> 03:12:11,219
and I'll say it again. It's, it's not about how much money a stream costs. It's, is it fun to do?

992
03:12:11,219 --> 03:12:17,000
Is it worth trying? I don't care if I spend a hundred dollars for a stream or a hundred million

993
03:12:17,000 --> 03:12:24,809
dollars. As long as it's an idea that I think is fun or that I want to do and I'm stuck. It doesn't

994
03:12:24,809 --> 03:12:33,610
matter. Look, if I can do it, I'll try. Right? I don't care. I actually am stuck though. I just

995
03:12:33,610 --> 03:13:02,200
realizing. Okay. I'm going to have to winch. Come on. This sucks. There we go. This was a horrible

996
03:13:02,200 --> 03:13:12,520
way to go. I, dollhouse friends is going to be living in my head rent free for years. Well,

997
03:13:13,159 --> 03:13:16,760
that makes me happy. Well, not that it's like, I don't know, living in your head rent free is

998
03:13:16,760 --> 03:13:24,229
like a, isn't that like a, don't you not want that? Um, I don't know. If you thought it was fun,

999
03:13:24,229 --> 03:13:32,840
then that makes me happy. That's all I care about. I really mean that. I'd like to get out of the

1000
03:13:32,840 --> 03:13:46,780
mud though. I'm so close. All right. Pull myself up with this. What the hell are you doing? Come on.

1001
03:13:46,780 --> 03:13:59,899
I'm going the right way, right? Okay. Why? This was such a dumb way. I was driving. Whatever. Just go.

1002
03:14:05,000 --> 03:14:10,139
Don't be modest. You knew it was going to be a great stream. That's it. You watched the behind

1003
03:14:10,139 --> 03:14:17,850
the scenes show yesterday. That's not necessarily guaranteed. It could have been very bad. It could

1004
03:14:17,850 --> 03:14:24,520
have been a disaster. We could have had extension problems. We could have had, because we were doing

1005
03:14:24,520 --> 03:14:29,799
it for three days. Is it going to still be even interesting after the first day? There was a lot

1006
03:14:29,799 --> 03:14:47,209
of potential for it to not really be that fun. Yeah. It could have been awful. So did I think

1007
03:14:47,209 --> 03:14:56,379
it was going to be worth doing? Absolutely. Everybody involved was so into it. That's how

1008
03:14:56,379 --> 03:15:01,670
you know that the project is probably a good idea. When every single person that's working on it is

1009
03:15:01,670 --> 03:15:06,170
like, this is really fun. Like we were having, we were actually, we were all having a lot of fun

1010
03:15:06,889 --> 03:15:15,510
during that week and the weeks before too. So if, as long as what some of you guys got out of that

1011
03:15:15,510 --> 03:15:19,829
stream was, you thought it was interesting. You thought it was fun. You had a good time

1012
03:15:19,829 --> 03:15:24,389
participating and everybody on the crew and the set had a good time too. That's, that's a win for

1013
03:15:24,389 --> 03:15:35,590
me. And I really hope to do way more stuff like that in the future too. That, that, but there's

1014
03:15:35,590 --> 03:15:38,629
no, I want to make this really clear, kind of how I started this part of the conversation.

1015
03:15:39,270 --> 03:15:45,670
I don't ever want people to think, holy shit, the dollhouse. Oh man, he's gonna have to do

1016
03:15:45,670 --> 03:15:52,629
something even bigger than that next time. That's kind of not the goal. There will be huge projects

1017
03:15:52,629 --> 03:15:59,049
like that. Maybe like, hopefully I try to do go to once or twice a year, but there's other stuff

1018
03:15:59,049 --> 03:16:02,649
that does not have to be that scale that I really want to do that I think would be fun to do.

1019
03:16:03,370 --> 03:16:09,909
Like I've said before, I might just call Jake like tomorrow and be like, hey, uh, I kind of want to,

1020
03:16:09,909 --> 03:16:13,030
what's going on in a couple of weeks? You want to do something? I have this idea.

1021
03:16:13,590 --> 03:16:21,399
It doesn't have to be in an elaborate, huge production, right? All right, let's try this

1022
03:16:21,399 --> 03:16:31,989
again. And we, we had significant backing from Twitch and from Coinbase. And I would like for

1023
03:16:31,989 --> 03:16:36,629
those, I mean, if it's possible, right? And I think you can't, you know, I hope that continues,

1024
03:16:37,590 --> 03:16:43,350
but if I can get the capital and get the funding and the money to be able to do stuff like that,

1025
03:16:43,350 --> 03:16:48,250
you're going to see stuff like that way more than you, way more often. If I can,

1026
03:16:48,889 --> 03:17:10,219
are you doing better medically? Oh, sure. Let's, uh, because now I can kind of just relax and we

1027
03:17:10,219 --> 03:17:13,100
can talk about this very briefly and I'm going to fall over again into the fucking water.

1028
03:17:14,059 --> 03:17:18,459
Uh, the medical thing that I was talking about, like a week before the stream was actually really,

1029
03:17:18,459 --> 03:17:26,780
really annoying. Uh, something I have to deal with now. Um, so it was a very stressful week leading

1030
03:17:26,780 --> 03:17:32,280
up to the dollhouse stream, not just because the dollhouse stream was happening, but, um,

1031
03:17:32,280 --> 03:17:38,889
I started to get dizzy and feel like pressure in my head. And it was like, don't even fucking tell

1032
03:17:38,889 --> 03:17:45,899
me this is something else that's going to start here. Uh, so I had to go in and get like an MRI

1033
03:17:45,899 --> 03:17:54,680
of my head. This is literally four or five days before the show. And thankfully there was nothing

1034
03:17:54,680 --> 03:18:05,290
really majorly wrong, but I have, um, cysts in my sinuses and I guess that can potentially cause

1035
03:18:05,850 --> 03:18:11,139
the problems that I was having. So I have to get those removed. So I have to go to like an ENT

1036
03:18:11,139 --> 03:18:19,030
and actually get some type of surgery, I think, to remove them. And they were not there before

1037
03:18:19,030 --> 03:18:21,430
because those of you that have been keeping up with the channel for a long time, at least the

1038
03:18:21,430 --> 03:18:27,190
last year or two, I had a brain and head MRI because of the unrelated other problem, right?

1039
03:18:27,190 --> 03:18:34,809
Like a year ago. And that, they, that, this was not there a year ago. So this is new. So I have

1040
03:18:34,809 --> 03:18:38,329
to just kind of go in and I was essentially told, yeah, you're going to have to go to an ENT and

1041
03:18:38,329 --> 03:18:42,709
they're going to have to get a better look. And I'm just probably going to have to get them removed.

1042
03:18:42,709 --> 03:18:48,120
So apparently it's very, very simple. It's a thankfully very easy thing to do.

1043
03:18:49,139 --> 03:18:52,500
And I'm not like in any pain or anything like this. Don't, don't get me wrong. I'm, I'm fine

1044
03:18:52,500 --> 03:19:00,760
completely. It was just, I think it's like putting weird pressure in my sinuses. So yeah, but I want

1045
03:19:00,760 --> 03:19:04,200
to kind of give you guys sort of what was going on there. Cause it was kind of, I was just kind

1046
03:19:04,200 --> 03:19:09,000
of weird. I'm just like, Oh yeah, I can't stream for like a week. Sorry. I got like an unrelated

1047
03:19:09,000 --> 03:19:13,000
other issue going on. And people were kind of like, what the fuck are we, what, what are you

1048
03:19:13,000 --> 03:19:19,590
talking about? What, what now? So let me clear the air on that, that like I'm fine. But I do have,

1049
03:19:21,159 --> 03:19:27,559
they're called like maxillary, they have an insane like five syllable name. It's like

1050
03:19:29,959 --> 03:19:36,680
something about maximiliterally sinus. Wait, let me, let me see what it is. Max, what's it called?

1051
03:19:36,680 --> 03:19:51,700
Maximus. Somebody knows what it is. Mucus retention cysts in your maxima. Yeah, there you go.

1052
03:19:52,180 --> 03:20:07,219
Max of the maxillary maxillary sinus retention cyst. There you are. It's a, it's a mouthful. Yeah.

1053
03:20:07,219 --> 03:20:25,270
Bro, no offense, but your, your body is making me angry. Yeah, me too. I'll be honest, but yeah,

1054
03:20:25,270 --> 03:20:29,819
I'm good. Don't worry. I'm going to be probably going in next week to see an ENT. We're just going

1055
03:20:29,819 --> 03:20:42,200
to just get rid of them. And then those problems will probably go away. Maximus. All right. Let me

1056
03:20:42,200 --> 03:20:49,819
get back to this. It's definitely not the garlic. He's still going to have the hernia surgery.

1057
03:20:49,819 --> 03:20:56,979
Probably. Yeah. Just to see if it fixes anything or helps anything. I forgot how to play the game.

1058
03:20:56,979 --> 03:21:03,459
How do I play the game? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This is going to be bad if I don't.

1059
03:21:03,459 --> 03:21:11,829
Did I, this is not going to happen again, is it? I think it is. I'm, oh no, this is going to happen

1060
03:21:11,829 --> 03:21:28,459
again. Wait, put this, put this away. Take it easy. What happened? What happened? How does it?

1061
03:21:29,020 --> 03:21:36,100
Hernia, hernia, Andy, Andy. Why do I say that like that? What's wrong with my voice?

1062
03:21:36,739 --> 03:21:51,670
Hernia, Andy. That scared the shit out of me. And I pressed it. All right. Pull me out, please.

1063
03:21:58,860 --> 03:22:05,989
What the fuck? I'm about to just say who cares about this mission? Cause now I can't do anything.

1064
03:22:05,989 --> 03:22:22,500
I have to attach the this and spin me around. Oh my God. I'm going over. Oh no, no, no, no, no,

1065
03:22:22,500 --> 03:22:34,299
no, no, no. Oh, you've got to be fucking kidding me. I didn't, I'm not coming back here again.

1066
03:22:35,819 --> 03:22:59,829
I'm not coming back here. Get the fuck out of here. Come on. Stay up. No, stay up, stay up,

1067
03:22:59,829 --> 03:23:18,170
stay up. It's like a giant kickstand. Stay up. Come on. Am I up? I am. All right. I'll go into

1068
03:23:18,170 --> 03:23:59,540
the fucking water, please. Okay. Well that was annoying. Galaxy brain. Top gamer moment of 2021.

1069
03:23:59,540 --> 03:24:08,180
No, I think getting out of the forest deserves that slot. So I got a question about No More Heroes 3.

1070
03:24:08,180 --> 03:24:13,620
I've been really anticipating that game for a few years now. Is it good? Be honest with me. I need

1071
03:24:13,620 --> 03:24:21,370
to know. I need to know if it's good. Is it good? I'm not reading reviews on it. I don't want to

1072
03:24:21,370 --> 03:24:29,180
know anything about it. Besides, is it good? Is it good? It's fucking amazing. I've heard it was good.

1073
03:24:29,180 --> 03:24:40,329
Okay. That's great. Perhaps. No mega low ups and downs, but it's good because I heard it was long.

1074
03:24:40,889 --> 03:24:59,989
All right. Is that in there? Not really. Shit. All right. Move. Just turn it. Oh my God. Put it

1075
03:24:59,989 --> 03:25:20,709
down. Come on. Can I just tilt it in there so it slides in? All right. Well, handbrake. Come on.

1076
03:25:21,270 --> 03:25:26,379
You should play Travis Strikes again. The only reason why I didn't want to play Travis Strikes

1077
03:25:26,379 --> 03:25:33,559
again is because I heard that game was even longer. And it's like a top-down game, right?

1078
03:25:34,280 --> 03:25:53,590
Isn't Travis Strikes again like 30 hours? I don't know if I want to do that. Come on.

1079
03:25:59,370 --> 03:26:04,120
That was awful. I can't do that three and a half hours into the stream after talking.

1080
03:26:04,120 --> 03:26:09,639
That was really bad. Oh yeah. You can oof. That was an oof. It was horrible.

1081
03:26:15,350 --> 03:26:36,020
Do we go for the other one? Come on. Let's do it. Let's go. How do I actually move this thing down?

1082
03:26:36,659 --> 03:26:42,139
All right. Yeah. Yeah. You're right. You're right. No. Stop. Stop. You're right. Turn it off.

1083
03:26:42,700 --> 03:27:00,200
I'm leaving. Now we're going to go this way. Straight ahead. Bang the left. Okay. Be careful.

1084
03:27:00,200 --> 03:27:04,200
Pack. Pack the bloody cargo. Pack the bloody cargo. Pack the bloody cargo.

1085
03:27:06,280 --> 03:27:25,899
Oh shit. I can do that. All right. I packed the bloody cargo. This thing's really heavy.

1086
03:27:41,209 --> 03:27:52,389
All right. Easy. There's no way I would have been able to do two. Not a chance. This mission sucks.

1087
03:27:52,389 --> 03:27:56,709
How much money do I even get? Like three grand? It seems like not enough for how annoying this is.

1088
03:27:56,709 --> 03:28:36,120
It just says you suck. I like that. I like that person. If you listen to Donda, I, I,

1089
03:28:36,760 --> 03:28:54,579
oy, oy, oy, oy. Handbrake. Handbrake. Handbrake. Handbrake. Handbrake. Oh God. All right. We're

1090
03:28:54,579 --> 03:29:08,149
good. I have not. Let's, I'm just going to attach the winch. I'm not going to, no bullshit here.

1091
03:29:08,149 --> 03:29:31,670
Pull it. Why is this breaking? Stop breaking the trees. You idiot. This shit's too heavy. I can't

1092
03:29:31,670 --> 03:29:46,709
do this. God. I can't, you know, I was supposed to upgrade my cars before I did this. That's

1093
03:29:46,709 --> 03:30:10,040
absolutely sure. Come on. Come on then. Come on then. It's too heavy. It's just too heavy. It's

1094
03:30:10,040 --> 03:30:18,709
too heavy. Now I'm in a lot of trouble. Now what do I do? I'm just going to have to pull myself

1095
03:30:18,709 --> 03:30:26,629
the whole way. All wheel drive. All wheel drive I think is on by default on this one. All right.

1096
03:30:26,629 --> 03:30:35,799
There we go. I'm all right. Come on. You can get through. Am I going to play No More Heroes 3 all

1097
03:30:35,799 --> 03:30:45,239
the way through? That's the plan. We'll see though. This weekend when I start it, we're going to do

1098
03:30:45,239 --> 03:30:51,670
probably Friday, Saturday or Saturday, Sunday. Keep an eye on the sus. You'll see. And after that,

1099
03:30:51,670 --> 03:30:56,870
I'll see how far I am. If I have another stream's worth, I would just try to finish it the next day

1100
03:30:56,870 --> 03:31:03,399
or a few days later or something. And then we do have the Sims 3 mod hell that I had actually

1101
03:31:03,399 --> 03:31:11,190
all ready to go before Dollhouse. But I didn't want to be a, I didn't want to just do the Sims

1102
03:31:11,190 --> 03:31:20,659
only for like a month. So that's ready to go. Wait, he actually is the sus guy. Thank you.

1103
03:31:21,909 --> 03:31:35,770
That's right. Okay. I love that person had to search for that. They looked it up. They were

1104
03:31:35,770 --> 03:31:47,559
like, wait a minute. No way. Did I, did I just get that person star struck? Are you? Can you believe

1105
03:31:47,559 --> 03:32:24,569
it? That's right. It's me. Uh, how do I unload this? Be with a face. I, it's not even my face.

1106
03:32:24,569 --> 03:32:38,709
How do I attach the card? Unpack card. How do I get rid of this? What? I have to, I can't,

1107
03:32:38,709 --> 03:33:20,020
I need both of them attached? No, I don't. Better not. Is it all right? Name's Pete. I work for a

1108
03:33:20,020 --> 03:33:24,340
transit company called Alaskan Transit. We've had an unfortunate accident is drilling containers of

1109
03:33:24,340 --> 03:33:34,840
tools stuck in the river. Can you locate them and get them to the base? Deliver to the port.

1110
03:33:34,840 --> 03:33:50,440
Fuck you. This is so far away. Oh, fuck you. Really? This is so, this is not worth this,

1111
03:33:50,440 --> 03:34:20,340
but three grand. Well, I have to put this back in now. God. Ah, do both, do both trailer trailer.

1112
03:34:20,340 --> 03:34:24,069
I don't think I can get a trailer in there. This engine that's in this car.

1113
03:34:24,069 --> 03:34:28,629
See how slow I was. I'm going to get stuck in that little weird spot where I was stuck before.

1114
03:34:40,729 --> 03:34:52,200
No, it's been the other way. Spin the other way. Turn, turn the other way. Oh, I'm getting that

1115
03:34:52,200 --> 03:34:56,040
like antsy. I'm just like wanting to shake and stuff. You know what I mean? You forget that.

1116
03:34:56,040 --> 03:35:16,760
I just want to start shaking around. Oh, okay. I could have just done that. Really? I don't want

1117
03:35:16,760 --> 03:35:30,680
to deliver this all the way to the port. That sucks. All right. First thing somebody puts in chat

1118
03:35:30,680 --> 03:35:41,100
is what I'm going to eat. And it better be burger king, long chicken sandwich, soy. No, nevermind.

1119
03:37:15,719 --> 03:37:22,059
Hi. Hello. How are you? Sorry about that. We should be good to go.

1120
03:37:24,709 --> 03:37:33,110
I'm going to need a refresh chat though. This chat crashed. I'd like a chat refresh. Clear chat.

1121
03:37:33,750 --> 03:37:58,819
Yeah, that was, that was my fault. That was my fault. Give me one sec. There you are. Okay.

1122
03:38:01,510 --> 03:38:10,659
What did you do? Uh, my VPN was on and I had it on a, I had it on a bad, um,

1123
03:38:11,219 --> 03:38:17,780
I had it on a server I shouldn't have been on. That was my fault. Sorry about that.

1124
03:38:18,420 --> 03:38:22,139
Oh my fucking God. Don't tell me that that's going to ruin everything.

1125
03:38:23,799 --> 03:38:39,829
No, I'm good. He did pirate the game. What does that mean? That means that some VP,

1126
03:38:39,829 --> 03:38:45,690
I thought that was on fire. Uh, some VPN service can get like junkie, especially at certain times

1127
03:38:45,690 --> 03:38:50,489
of day, certain times of night. And I was on one of the ones that was junkie. So that was my own

1128
03:38:50,489 --> 03:39:00,170
fault. New objective. Can I not go across this bridge? Oh, come on. What? How am I supposed to

1129
03:39:00,170 --> 03:39:15,459
get to the port if I can't go? How am I supposed to get over there? I can't go. Oh, are you serious?

1130
03:39:16,389 --> 03:39:23,379
I think I can drive over that. I'm just going to have to leave this here. All right. They stay,

1131
03:39:23,379 --> 03:39:29,510
it's permanent. So I'm just going to unpack it and leave it here. That's why you take the scout

1132
03:39:29,510 --> 03:39:34,969
first. Yeah, I know that you're right. I'm starting to understand how the game is played now.

1133
03:39:34,969 --> 03:39:38,659
You don't just drive around with the big guns. You have to take the little guy.

1134
03:39:41,690 --> 03:39:50,389
You got to go take your, um, hold on. I swear I'll make a reference in a few seconds when I

1135
03:39:50,389 --> 03:39:59,860
figure out how to get my fingers out of my eyeballs, like the Humvee in red alert.

1136
03:40:00,420 --> 03:40:04,760
You just drive around with it. Who cares if that car explodes. You're looking for where their bases

1137
03:40:05,479 --> 03:40:20,649
there. Okay. I got it out. Don't not. Oh my God. What the fuck are you talking about?

1138
03:40:20,649 --> 03:40:33,610
Why did you just die? Why did the engine stall? I'm all right. Give me the scout. I'm just going

1139
03:40:33,610 --> 03:40:50,809
to drive around the scout. At least I got the cargo out. All right. Give me, give me like,

1140
03:40:50,809 --> 03:40:59,829
just give me this thing. I'm going out with the truck. Let's go. This thing on all wheel drive

1141
03:40:59,829 --> 03:41:14,540
and let's fucking just hammer it. Let's move. I'm going to drive. I feel like I haven't completed

1142
03:41:14,540 --> 03:41:23,860
a mission in like an hour. Um, can I take it this way? I'm going up. Yeah, we'll go. I'm going this

1143
03:41:23,860 --> 03:41:33,860
way. Let's take the little scenic drive here and just see what we find. I'm just going to take a

1144
03:41:33,860 --> 03:41:48,420
little drive. Let's go. Plenty of gas. I'm ready. I just looked over and said I was live for four

1145
03:41:48,420 --> 03:41:53,540
minutes and I was like, how is that possible? I actually thought I was only live for four minutes.

1146
03:41:54,260 --> 03:42:06,059
It's like I am on drugs. What do you, how is that possible? No way. Because I've been live for about

1147
03:42:06,059 --> 03:42:32,739
four hours and it says four minutes. It's like, is my concept of time just ruined forever? I feel

1148
03:42:32,739 --> 03:42:42,149
like I'm really going to get into No More Heroes 3. It says three hours and 43 minutes for me.

1149
03:42:42,870 --> 03:43:08,420
I got to get those chain tires for real. We politely say what his shirt says. Uh,

1150
03:43:08,420 --> 03:43:30,680
this is a shirt from, uh, Omega Mart, the Meow Wolf exhibit in Vegas here. Omega Lul Mart. Yes,

1151
03:43:30,680 --> 03:43:53,899
I knew of course. Is it as awesome as it looks? Yes. I can safely tell you that this is, there's a

1152
03:43:53,899 --> 03:44:02,950
Meow Wolf in like three or four different cities. It absolutely is worth it. It's amazing. I'm not

1153
03:44:02,950 --> 03:44:06,709
going to say anything. I don't want to talk about it because there's a lot of interesting things

1154
03:44:06,709 --> 03:44:13,030
going on when you do it, but it was really, really cool. Really. What the flying fuck, dude. I can't

1155
03:44:13,030 --> 03:44:30,520
go anywhere. A rock slide? What do you mean a rock slide? Time for you to suit up and save the day.

1156
03:44:30,520 --> 03:44:57,379
I'm going around it. Now what? Rock obstacle. A shipment of cargo. Oh, oh, oh, nevermind. I

1157
03:44:57,379 --> 03:45:03,260
thought I just could, I thought I couldn't go around it. For some reason I thought it was like,

1158
03:45:03,260 --> 03:45:18,790
you can't go around. Sorry. No more swearing. Okay, fine. I won't. I promise. Can we say what

1159
03:45:18,790 --> 03:45:24,229
the shirt says? Not where you got it from. The shirt says thank you a bunch of times. Here, look.

1160
03:45:24,229 --> 03:45:42,360
I mean it's flipped, but here I'll flip it for you. Shirt says thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

1161
03:45:42,360 --> 03:45:47,399
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And then there's a image of the Omega Mart.

1162
03:45:47,399 --> 03:46:00,219
I like the shirt and think it looks good. I'm not going to do the sus face.

1163
03:46:10,340 --> 03:46:16,629
I'm sorry to really break everybody's magic here. The sus face is a computer generated image. That's

1164
03:46:16,629 --> 03:46:26,549
not even my face. It's my eyes and hair. And the rest is a weird stretched out CGI or something.

1165
03:46:29,540 --> 03:46:43,190
What's this? Gas over there and factory that way too. Oh, shit. There is a, okay, there's a tower

1166
03:46:43,190 --> 03:47:01,829
over here. Let's see if I can get the tower. Oh, this looks like a clock. I definitely don't want

1167
03:47:01,829 --> 03:47:10,569
to do this. Contest. People say you're one of the best drivers around. Maybe, maybe not. How about

1168
03:47:10,569 --> 03:47:25,930
a little challenge to see if you can beat my record? Okay. Reach point A. Oh my god. Um,

1169
03:47:26,569 --> 03:47:58,540
okay. Hold on. Uh, I guess I'll, let's go. What, what, how much time do I have? How am I supposed

1170
03:47:58,540 --> 03:48:19,780
to get up there? Do I turn my headlights on? What's, what's headlights? Fuck my eyes. Dude,

1171
03:48:19,780 --> 03:48:29,420
you can't do this. No, you, nobody can. This is impossible. I need a moped. I really don't think

1172
03:48:29,420 --> 03:48:43,659
I can do this. No, I don't, whatever. I think I can, I think I can count the whole time. I don't

1173
03:48:43,659 --> 03:49:09,190
care. I was wondering if you were ever going to eat a big hot dog on stream. You want to hear one

1174
03:49:09,190 --> 03:49:13,110
of the stream ideas that never happened. That would have been maybe funny for like maybe five

1175
03:49:13,110 --> 03:49:18,979
minutes. I wanted to do an eating contest of like steaks or hot dogs or whatever.

1176
03:49:19,540 --> 03:49:27,770
Be like a Coney Island thing. And the only reason why I thought it was funny is one of the contestants

1177
03:49:28,569 --> 03:49:34,090
has a fork and knife and is eating it really slowly. He's just enjoying like a dinner and he

1178
03:49:34,090 --> 03:49:47,219
eats just one. That was it. Don't get stuck. Don't get stuck. Don't get stuck. Don't get stuck. Don't

1179
03:49:47,219 --> 03:49:58,700
get stuck. Don't get stuck. Don't get stuck. Um, it's over. I'm stuck. Maybe not. Hold on. I'm almost

1180
03:49:58,700 --> 03:50:07,350
through it. Come on. We're going to go muddin. Come on. That's an actual family guy joke.

1181
03:50:08,489 --> 03:50:13,909
That probably is. I didn't do it. Obviously. Like I just was like, nah, nevermind.

1182
03:50:13,909 --> 03:50:24,899
That's a TikTok skit. Were you guys around when I said that I thought I think I'd be huge on TikTok

1183
03:50:26,680 --> 03:50:41,030
if I gave it really an effort? I think I would be the biggest thing on TikTok

1184
03:50:41,030 --> 03:50:49,209
ever. Like if you rewind the clock and I just started and it's like 10 years ago, but it's now

1185
03:50:49,209 --> 03:50:55,209
and I'm like 22, 23, 24, 25, I would be the number one most subscribed person on TikTok.

1186
03:50:55,209 --> 03:51:15,850
Guaranteed. Guaranteed. What an ego. No, I was just saying, you know, the, look at the, you know,

1187
03:51:15,850 --> 03:51:21,100
the dances I could do. The dances. Imagine me coming out with a new dance every week.

1188
03:51:22,760 --> 03:51:39,079
You don't think I'd be number one in the world? Travel to mountain river. Holy shit. Wait a minute.

1189
03:51:39,079 --> 03:51:45,370
This is a new zone. Okay. Maybe not the biggest thing in the world,

1190
03:51:45,370 --> 03:51:52,329
but I would be at least the most subscribed. I'd be the most subscribed person on TikTok

1191
03:51:52,329 --> 03:51:55,209
from like people in New Hampshire or something. You know what I mean? Like I'd have something.

1192
03:51:55,209 --> 03:52:02,409
I'd have that. I'd be able to claim that. New zone. Wait, this isn't a new zone.

1193
03:52:02,409 --> 03:52:21,420
Show us a dance right now to prove it. No, I can't show you a dance right now to prove it

1194
03:52:21,420 --> 03:52:31,819
because I don't have pants on. Restore the bridge, right? I'm just taking quests every time I see

1195
03:52:31,819 --> 03:52:41,139
anyone. Wait, hold on. I just need to know. Like, can I, can a car, can I explode this car?

1196
03:52:41,139 --> 03:52:56,860
I don't think I can even drive through this. 250 million off the debt if you make a TikTok.

1197
03:52:56,860 --> 03:53:08,420
No, make it way more than that. It needs to be way more than that. Nope. Nope. This is low ball

1198
03:53:08,420 --> 03:53:20,680
bullshit. I will agree to creating a TikTok and making one TikTok a week for the next,

1199
03:53:21,319 --> 03:53:28,100
well, starting, no, no, I literally don't feel like doing that right now. Starting like next week.

1200
03:53:28,100 --> 03:53:43,270
I just don't feel like doing that. Like I'm just gonna be honest. Why am I sliding? What the fuck?

1201
03:53:49,540 --> 03:53:55,989
What's wrong with the car? Close functions. What? All right. Enough of the bullshit. Let's go

1202
03:53:58,360 --> 03:54:04,760
clear the debt. I want to just, I want to see what the service hub is. I want to go there.

1203
03:54:08,520 --> 03:54:14,360
200 million per TikTok. But the TikTok has to get over 2k likes. Oh, fuck that.

1204
03:54:18,180 --> 03:54:28,680
Come on. I would have to hop on every trend on TikTok. Although that's kind of funny though.

1205
03:54:49,459 --> 03:55:02,819
Okay. All right. We're fine. 2k likes isn't much. That's kind of a lot, isn't it? Did I ever tell

1206
03:55:02,819 --> 03:55:06,819
you guys the idea of how I wanted to make a children's YouTube channel and not tell anyone?

1207
03:55:08,549 --> 03:55:12,309
Never speak a word of it and try to get like a billion fucking views on it.

1208
03:55:13,510 --> 03:55:21,350
God, I wish I was able to do that. I wish I was. Just make like a real good like children's

1209
03:55:21,350 --> 03:55:25,989
YouTube channel. That was like really, really well made. And don't tell any of you guys

1210
03:55:27,379 --> 03:55:37,989
until somebody had to find it. It's still time. Maybe one day. I wouldn't be Jerma. I would be

1211
03:55:37,989 --> 03:55:42,790
like Mr. Happy. It doesn't, I don't know. I'd be, I wouldn't be me. So you wouldn't be able to type

1212
03:55:42,790 --> 03:55:50,299
in like Jerma children's channel. No, that wouldn't work. And try to be more popular than this channel

1213
03:55:50,299 --> 03:56:03,829
here. I feel like I could, I think I could do it. God, what? Like, I really, I got to dial back

1214
03:56:03,829 --> 03:56:08,469
that narcissism here. Yeah. I think I could have a billion view children's channel. I'd be the

1215
03:56:08,469 --> 03:56:21,209
biggest TikToker in the world. Oh, Jeremy, right. Is this anything you can't do? I can't move. I

1216
03:56:21,209 --> 03:56:38,299
think I'm stuck on a log. Yeah, I'm stuck on a log. I actually, there's a shitload of stuff that I

1217
03:56:38,299 --> 03:56:54,860
can't do. A lot. Like a lot, a lot. Come on. That was a bunch of bullshit. There we go. I want to

1218
03:56:54,860 --> 03:57:07,159
see what's down here. I might be in trouble here. Maybe it's time to wind down and stop the stream.

1219
03:57:10,629 --> 03:57:22,600
No, I want to at least do one. I wanted to get to here. I can get out of here.

1220
03:57:22,600 --> 03:57:32,090
Four hour Andy. Yeah, that's me. Go back to Michigan. You know what? That's a great idea.

1221
03:57:32,090 --> 03:57:52,920
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to do that. Okay. Leave garage. Can I just, can I fast travel?

1222
03:57:57,239 --> 03:58:01,000
How do I fast travel? There was a menu I could go to before. Was it in the garage?

1223
03:58:01,639 --> 03:58:24,059
Where is it? What did I get to that menu before? Do I have to just drive there? No,

1224
03:58:24,059 --> 03:58:38,260
you can't drive from Alaska to Michigan. Can you? Yeah, you can. You gotta drive through Canada,

1225
03:58:38,260 --> 03:58:58,389
though. I gotta go to the garage. The actual garage. Mr. Slime. Yeah, there's been a couple

1226
03:58:58,389 --> 03:59:03,909
of concepts over the years of I just put a shitload of time into something and never tell you about

1227
03:59:03,909 --> 03:59:08,950
it and hope that I eventually you figure it out after like a year. And every time I come up with

1228
03:59:08,950 --> 03:59:13,049
one of these things, I think it's funny. I always have to go back to the fact that I have to do that

1229
03:59:13,049 --> 03:59:20,680
thing. Like I would, I would have to stream as Mr. Slime TV, like six hours a day. It's actually

1230
03:59:20,680 --> 03:59:27,620
streamed for like a year. That's like, that's like, I would, I don't even stream that much on my own

1231
03:59:27,620 --> 03:59:45,850
channel. Okay. So now we got to go to map. I can go here. Oh shit. I can go anywhere I want now.

1232
03:59:45,850 --> 03:59:59,270
Yukon. Let's go back to Michigan. Michigan. Think of the profits. I don't know if there would be

1233
03:59:59,270 --> 04:00:09,559
very many profits. Yeah, let's go. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

1234
04:00:09,559 --> 04:00:28,569
We don't. Oh, I have to move to garage, right? Okay. You never finished the TikTok discussion?

1235
04:00:29,290 --> 04:00:54,469
I don't think there's much else to discuss. Dual Twitch personality. Yeah. I think it'd be funny

1236
04:00:54,469 --> 04:01:00,409
for a little while, but then here's the problem with that. Both of these ideas. Who gets to take

1237
04:01:00,409 --> 04:01:09,079
priority? Let's say that Mr. Slime TV, right, or whatever his name is, gets to a point where he's

1238
04:01:09,079 --> 04:01:17,430
pulling 10k viewers a stream what do i do who do i even who am i who should i stream with if the

1239
04:01:17,430 --> 04:01:23,459
children's youtube channel has a billion views like that's i would have to i have to prioritize

1240
04:01:23,459 --> 04:01:39,879
it let's get this here did i already get this one no i don't i don't think so just sell out

1241
04:01:39,879 --> 04:01:45,479
completely just have one of my streamer personalities be the ultimate sellout and they just sell a

1242
04:01:45,479 --> 04:01:56,739
shitload of merch and it's sponsor space and like bounties and shit that's so fucked up but it's

1243
04:01:56,739 --> 04:02:15,059
funny wouldn't be the first time you abandoned the channel i want that guy timed out for a day

1244
04:02:15,620 --> 04:02:33,450
no don't actually do that this is dangerous but it's kind of the way i have to go what the fuck

1245
04:02:33,450 --> 04:02:45,079
what what the fuck what the fuck why is everything what the fuck it was literally the worst noise

1246
04:02:49,530 --> 04:02:52,680
was it you fucked up bro

1247
04:02:59,559 --> 04:03:06,469
that's my favorite yeah yeah hey you fucked up bro you fucked up dude go listen to it

1248
04:03:06,469 --> 04:03:36,500
somebody let me play it let me see it any any clips nine human goose baby wouldn't be the first

1249
04:03:36,500 --> 04:04:03,559
time you abandoned the channel not that bad it sounds that sounded like a seagull sounded like

1250
04:04:03,559 --> 04:04:09,290
a seagull with like a big dog bone in his throat or something like in a cartoon you know when they

1251
04:04:09,290 --> 04:04:12,889
swallow the big piece of meat and like and the bone like gets stuck and sticking out of both

1252
04:04:12,889 --> 04:04:33,719
sides of their skin like a car horn you know like tom like takes a big bite of the meat and he's

1253
04:04:33,719 --> 04:04:41,799
like and he's like got the bone is like sticking out of both sides of his like neck why am i

1254
04:04:41,799 --> 04:05:00,649
driving i'm not pressing any buttons squidward with the thing with a fork in his throat yeah

1255
04:05:01,290 --> 04:05:11,780
that's what it is yeah stop it all right i'm stopping oh what's over here i won't okay i

1257
04:05:28,120 --> 04:05:35,340
that noise again i promise i promise i won't make that noise ever again unless i eat a gigantic ham

1258
04:05:35,899 --> 04:06:01,799
on a big bone and it gets stuck in there this is very okay you want to hear my final assessment

1259
04:06:01,799 --> 04:06:18,180
of this game um okay you ready so snow runner sort of reminds me of when you just take a car

1260
04:06:19,129 --> 04:06:23,690
in gta 5 and just say fuck it i don't even care i'm just driving in a random direction

1261
04:06:24,250 --> 04:06:43,059
out into the wilderness and they made an entire game based off of it it's pretty cool i was so

1262
04:06:43,059 --> 04:06:47,719
scared you'd make the sound again i'm not gonna look if you get booed and do stuff throwing

1263
04:06:47,719 --> 04:06:55,159
tomatoes at you you don't keep doing the thing that they booed you for i took my booze i said

1264
04:06:55,159 --> 04:07:04,520
all right and i moved on unless i look unless i think it's funny which maybe i do you might

1265
04:07:04,520 --> 04:07:10,629
hear it again sometime i've made that sound like a half dozen times before it always gets

1266
04:07:10,629 --> 04:07:16,229
nominated that sound always is there at the end of the stream worst of the year awards always

1267
04:07:16,229 --> 04:07:22,389
it's every time go look back at worst sound category i guarantee you that sound is there

1268
04:07:22,389 --> 04:07:41,180
each time we've done it the last two or three years it's definitely there this is really pretty

1269
04:07:41,180 --> 04:08:02,469
stop making that noise stop stop stop making that sound it's not me doing it the frogs are

1270
04:08:02,469 --> 04:08:14,860
going like i'm not gonna do it but you heard it can't wait for part two of the german awards

1271
04:08:15,659 --> 04:08:40,600
oh yeah that's right warehouse is this what it's really like to drive in one of these

1272
04:08:40,600 --> 04:08:51,129
this looks like hell this sucks yeah it is do you eat beforehand i hope you don't

1273
04:08:51,129 --> 04:09:11,110
this is just turbulence plane simulator you eat during it oh my goodness this seems so rough

1274
04:09:11,590 --> 04:09:30,420
wait where are we going oh all right cool i'll go this way i didn't even press that that was my

1275
04:09:30,420 --> 04:09:48,600
elbow all i'm going through thick thick mud this is cool this is a cool game i don't know if i'm

1276
04:09:48,600 --> 04:09:54,760
gonna play this again i probably won't you know i'm one-off andy but this i like this it actually

1277
04:09:54,760 --> 04:10:21,959
was pretty cool how much is this game how much is 30 bucks 30 dollars yeah i think that's worth it

1278
04:10:21,959 --> 04:10:28,870
if you're a truck enthusiast but you love off-roading he's just like kind of exploring

1279
04:10:28,870 --> 04:10:32,469
and doing the difficult missions of trying to load cargo and go through mud and stuff

1280
04:10:33,030 --> 04:11:17,110
i mean it's 30 dollars i think is pretty reasonable so anticlimactic it's not even funny

1281
04:11:17,110 --> 04:11:25,559
i was going for a big finish and i'm just stuck that was there yeah that's resident sleeper come

1282

1287
04:12:28,629 --> 04:12:33,739
what i just did there it is you've been asking for that for like two hours and i did i just did it

1288
04:12:35,989 --> 04:12:54,780
so there you go oh whatever did you see that and it was the same exact scenario too

1289
04:12:55,340 --> 04:13:04,329

1293
04:13:40,709 --> 04:13:52,309

1294
04:13:52,309 --> 04:13:56,469
weekend because yesterday was like a two-hour andy with the behind the scenes show so i was

1295
04:13:56,469 --> 04:14:02,260
like let's just do something tomorrow too so here we are i actually had a lot of fun in this game

1296
04:14:02,260 --> 04:14:07,879
if i had a little bit more brain power and more patience i'd probably keep playing it

1297
04:14:07,879 --> 04:14:15,159
but i will see you guys again we're gonna start no more heroes three uh probably on friday or

1298
04:14:15,159 --> 04:14:20,629
saturday so in a couple days two three days we'll go two days in a row because i i'm really actually

1299
04:14:20,629 --> 04:14:28,649
very excited for that game very much excited to play it still kind of coming down from the dollhouse

1300
04:14:28,649 --> 04:14:37,020
uh still that high is still there and i'm just sort of trying to pace myself a little bit but

1301
04:14:37,020 --> 04:14:44,870
thanks for watching we'll see you again some other time hopefully in a couple days what about hard

1302
04:14:44,870 --> 04:14:49,270
time hard time is going to be i'm going to play it on the ipad probably or maybe the pc version

1303
04:14:49,270 --> 04:14:53,530
because it was kind of confusing there's like three versions but i was going to do like an

1304
04:14:53,530 --> 04:14:58,870
m dicky night there's two or three games that are only on mobile devices and one of them looks

1305
04:14:58,870 --> 04:15:05,430
really funny it's a superhero game you make your own superhero and you live in an m dicky universe

1306
04:15:05,430 --> 04:15:11,559
so i mean i kind of want to play that one so maybe we'll probably just do them all one night

1307
04:15:11,559 --> 04:15:26,379

1309
04:15:32,549 --> 04:15:39,700

1310
04:15:39,700 --> 04:15:48,739
here now are way more than i've ever had so i don't even know what to say about this kind of

1311
04:15:48,739 --> 04:15:58,379
uh subscription account it's crazy and obviously i mean i know this is probably even if it's

1312
04:15:58,379 --> 04:16:05,340
temporary i don't i don't know how there's many people that have given this channel five dollars

1313
04:16:05,340 --> 04:16:16,200
per month uh join us on the next one there's plenty more there's a lot at least a few more

1316
04:16:37,610 --> 04:16:42,090

1317
04:16:42,090 --> 04:17:00,459

1318
04:17:00,459 --> 04:17:06,899

1319
04:17:06,899 --> 04:17:19,290

1320
04:17:20,870 --> 04:17:26,950
