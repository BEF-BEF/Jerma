1
00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:10,630
Uh, I have a question. How do you, um, how do you do, like, the pointing emoji on PC?

2
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:15,580
Like, if I wanted to do, what, can somebody just do it so I can just copy it?

3
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:22,309
What's the, like, pointing, pointing, like a finger pointing? Yes. Yeah, there you go.

4
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:42,090
Thank you. All right, I'll be back. I, I apparently didn't copy it. How come I didn't copy it?

5
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:50,490
It's, oh, that's, it's a, well, hold on. It's because of BTTV emote. That's a middle finger.

6
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:54,490
I need, like, a, the pointing finger that's not from BTTV because I need to put it in the,

7
00:00:54,490 --> 00:01:08,170
I'm gonna put it in the title. Do Windows plus, I'm not gonna have to do that. Windows plus

8
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:12,939
for an emoji. How do I, does anybody, can somebody just write it so I can do it?

9
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:17,780
Oh, there you go. Thank you. There you go. There, there it is. That's what I want. Thank you.

10
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:35,400
All right. Appreciate it. This title is so bad. Actually, I like it. I actually like this title.

11
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:58,579
See, okay. Wait, why did you, you already put the, what, did you put the pointing thing in already?

12
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:10,090
What do you mean Neopets? What are you talking about? Why are you guys saying Neopets?

13
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,150
This has nothing to do with what I'm doing. All right. I'll be back. I'll be right back.

14
00:02:16,150 --> 00:10:24,700
All right. I'm actually going BRB. Okay. I had to get my tweet ready. I forgot about it.

15
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:55,659
Are we all ready? Getting there. Very cool. I'm going to do my tweet. There it is. All right.

16
00:10:55,659 --> 00:11:03,129
Let me just capture the game. That's important. Oh, I got to do my, hold on. This is important too.

17
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:15,940
Let me get this out of the way because I need to make sure my webcam is not going to freak out.

18
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:48,629
All right. So we're going to do co-op. Let's see. Talk to the people here. All right. I'm going to

19
00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:58,360
say, all right. That's how you know it's about to start when I say, all right. But seriously though.

20
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:20,539
All right. The switch is not available right now. Turn that off. Turn this off. Okay. I'm ready to

21
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:45,210
play Gotham Knights. I had to pee. Okay. Your title still says Zelda. That's changing. Now I

22
00:12:53,139 --> 00:13:04,230
got to plug this in. That is changing very shortly. No, it doesn't. You just gaslit me so bad,

23
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:16,950
didn't you? All righty. All righty. All righty. All righty. Jesus Christ, man. All right. I got

24
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:37,340
to think some more filler words than just, okay. All right. All right. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah.

25
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:50,230
The last thing I was playing is Batgirl, but I was, I was hit up by a one son. He said, hey,

26
00:13:50,230 --> 00:14:00,460
I think, I think we need to do some co-op stuff with the campaign. I was like, huh? Oh, let's call

27
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:16,279
him. See if he's available. Hey, what's up? Oh, I can't hear you. Hold on.

28
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:33,340
I don't know what he's saying. I can't hear him. Have you played this game at all?

29
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:40,330
Oh yeah. I've been playing for like three days. Have you done the tutorial? You might

30
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:47,539
have to do the tutorial. Yeah, I'll carry it. Just once you can do multiplayer, we'll uh,

31
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,059
just give me, give me a ping. This is like, this is a classic. Another,

32
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:55,460
yet another classic goof and gaff session where John carries me through. Hey dude,

33
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:59,940
are you ready to goof off? It's going to be so fun. I'm going to goof off. I'm goofy. I'm

34
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,620
goofy with it. Okay. I'm going to finish this video first. All right. Get, get, get out of here

35
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:18,149
and do the tutorial for God's sake. Okay. I got to put him through a different, yeah. Hold on.

36
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:27,100
Uh, hold on. All right. I'm muted there. Let me, uh, I could have changed this. We'll play as a

37
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:32,730
backer for a little bit and then he's ready. We'll go from there. We're going to goof off.

38
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:38,419
It's going to be goofy. All right. So my input is fine, but the output is the problem, the output,

39
00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:46,470
because he's come through the wrong thing. I wonder if that's going to be better. We'll test it when

40
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:52,259
he gets back. And yeah, I know my webcam is freaking out. There's nothing I can do about it.

41
00:15:52,899 --> 00:16:06,309
So, but I, it does, wait, it says, it says I'm playing as Robin. Oh, that's bad. I am, this is

42
00:16:06,309 --> 00:16:18,389
not Robin. Wait a minute. We're not even on the same, we're not even on the same mission. They're

43
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:39,830
not even close. Is he going to be level one? Hey, can we ride the car together? But anyways,

44
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:45,029
we're about, we're about to start. At least I am. Welcome everybody. This is a sponsored stream.

45
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:51,830
Gotham Knights is currently out now. It's for the Xbox Series S, the Xbox X, the PC, the,

46
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:56,149
what did I just say? The PlayStation 5. It's got co-op. We're going to show that today. This is

47
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:05,349
Batgirl. You're going to see Robin. Open world, Batman like game. All right. So let me do this

48
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:24,900
mission. Dude, you got to really lean into it. Turn around. How would I turn around? You need

49
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:32,819
your overlay. You guys are just on point. You really are. Where am I going to go? Down here,

50
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:45,029
right? Yeah. Yeah. I got an image panel. There's a panel down below. If you click it, it will take

51
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:50,759
you to the opportunity for you to buy Gotham Knights. Why does it want me to turn around?

52
00:17:50,759 --> 00:18:05,700
It's over here. Yeah. Thanks Warner Brothers for sponsoring this segment of today's stream.

53
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:18,650
I'm going to switch to Robin. I promise. Batgirl, I'm leaving. What? What did that person say?

54
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:32,779
All right. Did I actually have to go the other way? Shut up. What are they talking about? All

55
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:47,539
right. Hold on. I need to go. Who is he talking to? Somebody did something that exploded. Um,

56
00:18:48,259 --> 00:19:14,410
excuse me. What's with that fucking in menu BM bullshit? All right. I'm out of here. Batgirl,

57
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:25,339
I'm leaving because I'm not playing as Robin. What is going on here? Is that her? What was it?

58
00:19:25,339 --> 00:19:37,779
What? No, I'm locked into the mission. I'm already locked into the mission. Don't throw stuff into

59
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:49,589
cars. Idiot. Did I go on that bridge this way and I'm coming back on this bridge that way?

60
00:19:51,180 --> 00:20:37,539
I'm doing it my way. Okay. So there he is. Let's see what's going on here. Colonel Kane. Who's that?

61
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:43,829
Sergeant Pennyworth. Why are you wearing? Why is he wearing a Catwoman suit? I'm not. I had to

62
00:20:43,829 --> 00:20:49,740
push our meeting so late. Work never seems to stop in this city. Oh, I can certainly relate.

63
00:20:50,619 --> 00:21:02,940
The paperwork hasn't let up since Bruce's passing. I still can't believe it. Burying Bruce was the

64
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:11,099
hardest thing I've ever done. Yeah. Do you remember what I mean? I'm just Robin after Tommy. I was

65
00:21:11,099 --> 00:21:20,500
just close to it. So I want to get it done. You said life matters when death matters. We take the

66
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:26,890
living for granted until they're gone. What settings am I on? What the Wayne Foundation will

67
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:36,730
do without Bruce? I'm on so I'm gonna have a 3090 and I have a 1440p resolution. Master Grayson. 60

68
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:45,460
fps frame rate I think. Yeah. Dick had his first investor call the other day. I'm surprised. I do

69
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:51,140
get a little bit of stuttering. I find you geezers escape from the old folks. Don't you know what's

70
00:21:51,460 --> 00:22:01,529
going on? Every day I find new reasons to be proud. Empty your pockets or empty the gun.

71
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:21,259
We're gonna get like an Alfred moment here where he's like, you know what? Never mind. Oh, um,

72
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:32,630
quite the about face. That punk didn't know who he was messing with. Wow. Holy shit. Have a drink.

73
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:39,670
Catch up. Don't have to twist my arm. Let's not be long though. Isn't that girl supposed to be in

74
00:22:39,670 --> 00:23:03,769
this cut scene? Oh, I was observing the cut scene from up. I actually think Batgirl might be.

75
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:12,089
Well, I can't say that until I play Robin. Let's change to Robin.

76
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:29,029
Robin time. Do you have concealer on? No, I don't have concealer on. It's a face smoothing filter

77
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:38,099
that I have turned on. Robin, you guys ready? I'm the only person on Twitch playing this game

78
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:59,029
with Robin, I think. Here we go. The title is now accurate. Stealth specialist, tactical genius,

79
00:23:59,029 --> 00:24:10,819
bow staff prodigy. All right. What does Robin got for moves? We're gonna do the gears first.

80
00:24:10,819 --> 00:24:29,690
All right. I got my suit. I actually cool. Whoa. This is Robin's suit in and beyond. I mean,

81
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:35,660
this thing, I kind of want to, I kind of want to be in this because I, when I look at this picture,

82
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:49,299
it's like, okay, that's, that's Robin. I guess that's so I love it. Ooh, he's got a slingshot.

83
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:58,759
Are you shitting me? All right. I, I'm very curious now. I'm the only person on Twitch

84
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:09,940
playing with Robin. Slugger, shadow or tinkering. Robin produces no sound while running and moves

85
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:22,009
faster. Okay. Uh, perfectly timed dodge. That's kind of good. 20% more damage when attacking from

86
00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:29,339
behind. 20% more crit damage. Robin's decoy inflicts a large amount of, is it decoy? What's

87
00:25:29,339 --> 00:25:42,809
this thing? Should I be stealth? Stealth, Steven? Don't do the ghost pepper challenge. Uh, I think

88
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:52,869
I'm going for slugger. I like doing damage. You know what I mean? 10% crit chance. Yeah.

89
00:25:52,869 --> 00:25:59,640
Decoy. Yeah. I'm just going full slugger. All right. Let's check out his move set.

90
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:19,289
Jerma chat is unhinged. Uh, they'll be all right. They'll settle down. They'll be all right. They

91
00:26:19,289 --> 00:26:29,059
settle after a little while. I'm actually kind of looking forward to, uh, getting in a game with

92
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:37,829
Hassan and him kind of his reaction to this character. He's going to be like, who are you

93
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:42,460
playing as? I'm going to be like, oh, of course that's bald boy. You know, Hassan, you don't know

94
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:52,579
who fucking bald boy is. Do you even watch the TV shows or movies? Ooh, what is this? Like little

95
00:26:53,690 --> 00:27:11,750
throws rocks. All right. Let's give it a try. I need to make the fast travel thing. Don't I?

96
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:28,230
Honestly, I feel like this is, I feel like I'm traversing more ground than I do with the bike.

97
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:36,740
You can just fly around the city like this. Okay. So it's over here.

98
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:43,539
So this is the powers club. This is the culmination of the last thing we did last night.

99
00:27:44,259 --> 00:28:08,470
Let's go. Let's kick some ass. Wait, I have a stealth specialist, aren't I? I'm inside. Good.

100
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:19,859
Be careful and let us know what you find spotted a patrol. Level seven. Oh, I might be too love with

101
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:45,940
this. Nobody can see. Oh God. Maybe you can. You look over at us in this. Holy shit. That'd be

102
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:53,990
terrifying. You know what? Why don't, why doesn't everybody just wear a superhero costume? If I

103
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:58,630
lived in this universe, I feel like less people would fuck with you. If I lived in any of these

104
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:03,539
superhero universes and I didn't have powers, I would put a costume on and just walk around and

105
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:08,019
shit. Did I go to the grocery store? I feel like people would be like, Oh, you're not like a regular

106
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:15,059
guy. You might, you're like fucking burp man or something. Right. Who knows? Like I feel like that

107
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:18,259
you'd, I feel like I'd be less inclined to like, Oh, I'm going to sneak up behind this guy and

108
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:23,859
stealth kill him. If this guy was in like a bright green spandex suit with like a pair of goggles on,

109
00:29:23,859 --> 00:29:28,230
I'd be like, Oh fuck, I got to be careful. Right. Why don't they just wear costumes?

110
00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:44,809
Okay. Let's scan the area. Oh, blood. AR shows a clear trail of blood. Wonder if there's anything

111
00:29:44,809 --> 00:29:53,880
else to see. There's something hidden under the floor. The hatch is wired to a network.

112
00:29:54,519 --> 00:30:05,109
There must be some way to activate it through the lamp. Okay. This way, but the light switch on the

113
00:30:05,109 --> 00:30:14,970
lamp. Yeah. You could just make up what your powers were. Right. Okay. Somebody was like,

114
00:30:15,529 --> 00:30:18,970
who the heck are you, man? I've never seen you around here. You're the superhero. I'd be like,

115
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:25,880
that's right. By the way, if I look at you and I decide you'll instantly die, I feel like people

116
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:33,289
would be like, Holy fuck me and get away from me. I'm instant die Reno. Right. No one would fuck with

117
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:39,960
you. And I would hire actors to like come and come after me and I would look at them and they would

118
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:50,119
just drop down. So people wouldn't be able to prove I couldn't do it. They said we'd be working

119
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:59,690
at a club. This isn't exactly what I had. Remain undetected. Just saying. I was hoping for something

120
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:05,700
a little more clubby and a little less creepy. Shut up. It's easy money. We barely have to see

121
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:12,180
the snobs anyway. Yeah. What the hell is that about? Who cares? The less we know, the better.

122
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:46,940
Looks like shit. I haven't been detected yet. I haven't been detected yet. Get out. Okay. I'm good.

123
00:31:46,940 --> 00:32:35,099
This one right here. You're aiming at a wall, dude. Don't have a fuck with bug boy. Robin school's

124
00:32:35,099 --> 00:33:11,130
character in the fucking game. I'm the only one playing him. No, Robin's my character. Oh shit.

125
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:24,099
Right in the head. Hey, dude. Oh, right in the eye. Is this dangerous or am I just annoying?

126
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:30,599
I think everyone right now is not doing anything because they're like, holy shit. Wait a minute.

127
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:34,359
This might, I don't think this is like a grown up. This is like a kid in this awesome outfit.

128
00:33:56,890 --> 00:34:06,009
Ooh, that's cool. Bo staff. Okay. This is not just a Bo staff. This is an extendable Bo staff.

129
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:29,690
It's a telescopic telescopic Bo staff. Find a way. Okay. Flip the switch. Let's go. All right.

130
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:38,550
Well, it's right there. Okay. Hidden in plain sight. Press the button. Oh, I can press it.

131
00:34:39,269 --> 00:35:05,829
Can I get in there? How do I get down there? Oh, there it is. Cool. I'm just, I just want

132
00:35:05,829 --> 00:35:11,510
all of a sudden to turn the corner and you just hear. Ranger. Oh Robin, you think you're such a

133
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:24,469
smarty. Well, I don't think you're going to be so smart after you deal with me. Okay. Follow the

134
00:35:24,469 --> 00:35:35,530
wires now. Where do they go now? Oh shit. I was too busy like talking. I missed it. I missed it. I

135
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:49,349
was talking. I'm an idiot. Find a way to follow the activated wires. I mean, was it part of the

136
00:35:49,349 --> 00:36:02,949
bust? Where was it? It's not that thing down there, right? Connected to electric. No. Back of the

137
00:36:02,949 --> 00:36:27,800
bust. I just was in my own world. Where are they going? Oh, come on. All right. Follow the wire.

138
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:56,010
The wire goes here and then it stops though. I mean, the activated wire is going down there.

139
00:36:57,769 --> 00:37:14,809
Should I try to go down? No. Uh, is he for real? Oh, I thought, okay. I'm sorry. That's my bad. I

140
00:37:14,809 --> 00:37:19,849
thought I had to like follow it. It's not like, oh, I thought it was, you know what I mean? Whatever.

141
00:37:19,849 --> 00:37:30,809
Nice brain. Yeah. What, what did you get in science? Probably a C. I got a D. So I don't care.

142
00:37:40,869 --> 00:37:45,510
You got a B. What's this weird labyrinth?

143
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:12,260
What's down here? Okay. All the blood trail. Where am I? The blood stops at the wall.

144
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:20,889
Weird. That's weird. Well, obvious way through here. There has to be more to this. Yep. Right

145
00:38:20,889 --> 00:38:36,010
there. Nope. That's a light spotlight. All right. Turn it on. Okay. That did something.

146
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:53,849
Oh shit. God damn it. The shadow puzzle. Uh, what am I trying to make? Probably the fountain,

147
00:38:53,849 --> 00:39:19,750
right? Am I trying to make the thing that's on the wall? Is that an eagle? That looks correct.

148
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:38,869
So now I got to do the body, which is down here. One more. That should be it. All right. That's not

149
00:39:38,869 --> 00:40:18,599
it. That's not it. Almost. Was it this wing here? I feel like this could be accurate any way this

150
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:41,530
could be, right? Depends. It's like that different angle. Why did they not do that before? Let's get

151
00:40:41,530 --> 00:41:15,030
the shit out of me. Oh, it's the owls. You are. Yep. What was that? Holy shit. You do like a,

152
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:37,369
you do a decoy. That's cool. That's what I'm saying. If you're the penguin and you talk,

153
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:41,610
you're tell, your penguin tells the truth. If you say you're the penguin, you are being serious.

154
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:56,460
By the way, for people that can do this in real life, how, how do you do that? It doesn't even

155
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:03,909
make any fucking sense that a human being can do that. People can do this shit. People can do that.

156
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:16,550
All right. Look at the blood trail. I can because I'm not a weak ass motherfucker.

157
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:28,659
Let's see how deep this goes. All right. Guess I just follow the blood then. Not gross at all.

158
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:48,150
So many things we could have done. His death has cleared the way for our new acquisition.

159
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:52,949
Good. However, do try to be careful where you're looking.

160
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:02,809
We've already brought the senators. I've been assured your bill will pass in the next month.

161
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:26,789
What is going on with that dog? I'm sorry. Turn it up. I can't move the camera. I want to get

162
00:43:26,789 --> 00:43:51,159
a close up of the dog's face. I can't zoom in. No, you can't. Hold on. Can I just, what about if

163
00:43:51,159 --> 00:44:12,489
I didn't crop everybody out in a frame? Okay. That's pretty good. I like that. I should let

164
00:44:12,489 --> 00:44:50,360
a film grain do it. I can't change the lighting. That's all I can do. Okay. I got it. I guess I

165
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:58,230
have no other choice but to go through them. No one gets through. The ceremony can't be delayed.

166
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:02,579
You don't need to tell me that twice. This is our chance to impress the voice.

167
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:07,429
He'll be intruders first. Then you can think about the rewards. Oops.

168
00:45:14,309 --> 00:45:19,639
Wrong fucking way. Whatever. I guess I technically could run away and then hide.

169
00:45:29,539 --> 00:46:07,300
Resilient takedowns. It counts. That was fucking awful. Oh my God. What a horrible way to go.

170
00:46:08,179 --> 00:46:31,059
I don't even feel like there should be something like the mask sound effects whenever you move

171
00:46:31,059 --> 00:47:00,940
around like this. Like, I need one more silent takedown. Don't ever do that again. I mean,

172
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:13,579
I saw a lot of plus twos on that one. I don't know. Should I do it again? See ya.

173
00:47:19,219 --> 00:47:26,010
Oh, watch this. We're gonna take this guy out like this. I'm gonna meat grind this motherfucker.

174
00:47:26,650 --> 00:48:08,340
I missed this backswing with it. That's good. Oh, right in the head. Really? There's more?

175
00:48:09,539 --> 00:48:43,030
Shit. So bad. Oh, I like that move. It bent the staff. I hit them so hard in the head.

176
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:52,440
I bent the staff around that person's head. This is a lot of blood. More than most people can spare.

177
00:48:53,239 --> 00:49:01,159
He's easy, Robin. Jeez, Robin. I mean, I know you took out like 10 people, but

178
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:29,699
pull back a little here. Oh, I hear someone. He's still alive. Who's this?

179
00:49:30,099 --> 00:49:39,579
Come on. Look out. We're hit me. I'm in the enemy's back. It won't happen again.

180
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:55,130
Death to the traitor. And death to also that guy.

181
00:49:57,769 --> 00:50:05,929
The guy, the metal bald guy too, I guess. The voice of the court comes. He will dictate the

182
00:50:05,929 --> 00:50:18,230
punishment. I don't know who that is, but death to you. Who is this?

183
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:32,389
The court cannot forgive your failure. You will atone with blood. Owl man?

184
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:43,590
And you, Vernon, do not belong here. The last time an intruder set foot here was more than a

185
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:49,380
century ago. The punishment for this insult remains the same.

186
00:50:51,380 --> 00:51:14,360
You didn't save that guy. I missed the QTE. No, I didn't. Oh my God. It was like a fucking

187
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:34,389
death room. I was trying to jump through it. It's not the time to like show off.

188
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:40,599
Oh my God. All right. Stop it. Look at all these bones. How do you, I'm trying to slide.

189
00:51:41,320 --> 00:52:11,619
Oh, it's just walk through it. Oh my dude. Hey, what that wouldn't be.

190
00:52:12,179 --> 00:52:15,460
I'm made out of fucking solid steel. It would scrape my chest.

191
00:52:21,320 --> 00:53:10,420
Shit. No, this is hard. This is actually fucking hard. Oh my goodness. Jesus. Okay.

192
00:53:14,739 --> 00:53:25,289
I was just going to say what, what is this doing down here? Oh dude. What? Oh my God, man.

193
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:39,559
Get away from me. Holy shit. That was impossible. I accidentally just did that. Sticking that

194
00:53:39,559 --> 00:53:43,960
landing makes the whole thing, you know, everything's good. Everyone's dead.

195
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:54,579
Game's loud. I turned it on. That should be better. It's like a thousand people down here.

196
00:54:01,289 --> 00:54:07,139
That was insane. Hey, Jerma, are you there? Oh my God. I thought that was in the game.

197
00:54:08,409 --> 00:54:15,260
I thought that was in the game. Oh my God. That scared the shit out of me. Jerma. It's me.

198
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:23,340
Snake. Solid snake. I have a question. What's up? I finished the first mission,

199
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:27,099
but it's still not unlocking multiplayer. How do I unlock multiplayer?

200
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:37,900
Hmm. So I, my multiplayer is unlocked. Let me see. I wonder if I can just pull you in

201
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,940
because did anybody know what, what mission you have to do? Cause I didn't pay attention

202
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:46,730
to that yesterday the day before. Which one did you pick by the way? Cause I'm,

203
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:52,539
I'm, I'm double gatted up. What, what are you playing as a red hood? Yeah, I got the gat.

204
00:54:53,099 --> 00:54:59,619
Okay. That's fine. I'm playing as the much superior Robin. Uh, no shot. You picked Robin.

205
00:54:59,619 --> 00:55:05,429
You need to do mission 1.2. Let me see if somebody got the answer here. Mission 1.2,

206
00:55:05,429 --> 00:55:08,949
where you investigate Langstrom's corpse. That's the mission you have to complete.

207
00:55:08,949 --> 00:55:14,889
I did that already. I just investigated that. Did you complete it? Or wait, no. Uh, I don't think

208
00:55:14,889 --> 00:55:22,860
I did. Wait, maybe I didn't do it. Oh, people are saying, oh, you didn't do it. Okay. Um, okay. F1

209
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:26,699
Batman's last case, the Langstrom drive, right? The Belfry is being brought back online until

210
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:30,619
then patrol the streets of Gotham and fight criminals. That sounds like it is. It should

211
00:55:30,619 --> 00:55:38,360
be 1.2. You have to, uh, did you do the part where you investigate the corpse? There's like a,

212
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:43,420
you look at the corpse and it's like a little detective mini game. I don't think I did that.

213
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:48,889
Yeah. Um, no, I have not seen a corpse yet. I'm just investigating criminals. I'm investigating

214
00:55:48,889 --> 00:55:55,539
crimes right now or not crimes. I'm just waiting for crimes to happen so I can deliver some swift

215
00:55:55,539 --> 00:56:01,139
vigilante justice in the form of red hood with my guns. Yeah. The game is that you have to,

216
00:56:01,139 --> 00:56:05,059
you do crime, you solve crimes and stuff in the kind of in between

217
00:56:05,059 --> 00:56:10,980
of the main mission. I don't do crime. I solve a long story. Can I be the one that says that's

218
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:15,380
kind of stuff? Cause I'm Robin. I'll tell you more when I get back. Wait, okay. Wait, what's,

219
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:20,179
what are the vibes? What would my vibes be as I'm solving the way, did you say you were solving

220
00:56:20,179 --> 00:56:24,260
crimes? Or did you say, what did you say? Wait, hold on. I'm hearing machine gun fire.

221
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:31,269
Oh no, I don't do crime. No. Yeah. I'm supposed to be like the smart one that can

222
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:36,070
finagle engineering and stuff and get us out of sticky situations we might get ourselves into.

223
00:56:37,179 --> 00:56:41,019
Oh my God. I'm so good at shooting. It's not even funny. Yeah. You just, you're the muscle.

224
00:56:41,739 --> 00:56:54,300
As long as you're the muscle and on the brains, we'll be fine. As I almost get by a train.

225
00:56:55,099 --> 00:57:00,170
What did you say, Jeremiah? I couldn't hear you. I'm sorry. Oh, I just said I'll be the brains.

226
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:06,179
You'd be the muscle. Okay, good. I have no brain. So that works perfectly for me. I think I just

227
00:57:06,179 --> 00:57:16,070
stopped the crime. It should be the other way around. How? No, definitely not. Well,

228
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:22,840
actually I've seen old photos of you and you are a thought. So. Okay. I question for you.

229
00:57:23,739 --> 00:57:28,940
What's up? If you were to pick a Batman rogues gallery villain that you would identify with it,

230
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:38,139
like, oh, that's me. Who would it be? I have no idea. I mean, I don't know. I don't have a good,

231
00:57:38,139 --> 00:57:41,820
I don't have a good enough. Oh my God. This is wonderful. You think you're like the Joker or?

232
00:57:42,699 --> 00:57:46,139
No, that's too cliche. I feel like everyone always picks that.

233
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:52,940
Okay. What about the Redler? I like Bane, not Riddler. I think Bane is more my speed. He was

234
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:57,980
a bit of a, he was a bit of a lefty too. Okay. All right. That's a good answer. He was just

235
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:02,539
not ideologically pure, but he was close to being a lefty. Like he had the motivation.

236
00:58:02,539 --> 00:58:05,739
Let's see if master Bruce left us anymore. Okay. Like that's um,

237
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:10,380
Margie. I can respect that. Okay. What would you be the Riddler?

238
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:18,860
Um, I would be the person that is selling all the equipment. I would want to, I would want

239
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:26,460
to be the one that was like just part of the company, but nothing concrete. I can't authenticate

240
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:32,059
any of these. Someone said German would be the mad hatter. I'm in the same universe. I love the

241
00:58:34,059 --> 00:58:39,019
sound. You are talking over my cut scene. What would have made a wonderful addition to the library?

242
00:58:39,019 --> 00:58:48,300
Am I loud? I'm just, I'm trying to see what's happening. I am trying to literally unlock the

243
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:53,739
mission, but it's not unlocking it. I think I need to solve more crime. There were a lot of bodies.

244
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:59,820
Yeah. You should have a thing like a case file thing and it'll tell you like, oh, there's this

245
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:04,300
you can do. There's this you can do. Go solve some stuff in Gotham. Yeah. No, that's what I did,

246
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:08,619
but it was like, wait, hold on. Now it's loud. Okay. I did that, but then it was like,

247
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:13,719
I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to lower the audio of the game first because

248
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:19,960
games these days are so loud. I feel like an old man saying that young whippersnapper.

249
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:24,039
All right. Out of the four here, who do you think is the coolest? Nightwing, Red Hood,

250
00:59:24,039 --> 00:59:30,099
Robin or Batgirl? No, Red Hood. 100. Ah, Nightwing, Nightwing. Good answer. I wasn't

251
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:34,579
going to leave the call if you said, uh, Red Hood. Why? What's up with this anti-Red Hood

252
00:59:34,579 --> 00:59:40,579
sentiment that I'm hearing from so many people? Nightwing is like my favorite.

253
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:53,059
I mean, Nightwing is pretty good. Nightwing is the original. I wonder if I can just like

254
00:59:53,059 --> 01:00:06,889
suck you into my game. It might be possible. All right. Let me read my emails. Oh, right

255
01:00:06,889 --> 01:00:13,690
direction. Belfry. Did you get it? No, I think this is the crime I need to solve though.

256
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:21,030
I'm sending you the coordinates now. Did I get any new stuff? Let me see. Nice.

257
01:00:24,869 --> 01:00:33,530
Oh, I like that one. That looks cool. By the way, as you play, make sure you check on your gear too.

258
01:00:34,659 --> 01:00:39,539
Uh, this, you got suits, you unlock suits, you unlock weapons. Oh yeah. I want to change out of

259
01:00:39,539 --> 01:00:49,260
the sleeveless hoodie as quickly as possible. I have a point I can put in. Oh, I have to go to

260
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:58,550
the GCPD morgue now. There it is. That's the one I can't steal cars though, which is no,

261
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:06,440
you do have access to the bicycle though. I really do wonder what this game is going to be like in

262
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:12,119
co-op. Are we going to, you haven't done it yet. So you played the game already. You did one.

263
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:19,849
Yeah. I played the last couple of days. Okay. Okay. Because I think we can be anywhere. I,

264
01:01:19,849 --> 01:01:23,369
um, this might be incorrect. I'm curious, but I don't think it's like, oh, you have to be within

265
01:01:23,369 --> 01:01:33,590
like 10 feet of each other or something. I wonder maybe you do. Is there a camera? Can you turn on

266
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:40,630
camera tracking while you're, uh, while you're driving or is that just a product of me playing

267
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:43,590
keyboard? Are you playing keyboard and mouse or are you playing controller? Uh, I would say

268
01:01:43,590 --> 01:01:50,260
keyboard and mouse would be an, a not ideal way to play this game. Are you on keyboard mouse?

269
01:01:51,849 --> 01:01:57,699
I am. Were you playing multiverses on keyboard and mouse too? No, no, no, you weren't. I was

270
01:01:57,699 --> 01:02:08,010
just bad at multiverses. I was just bad at it. Uh, where's my car? Wait, what? Everyone's asking

271
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:16,889
you to hit the Luddie. Have you hit the Luddie yet? I have not. Have you? Yeah. Oh yeah. I nailed

272
01:02:16,889 --> 01:02:31,050
it. I'll hit it after this. Wait, what? Weird. What? So I'm, I'm going to, I'm not going to start

273
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:36,469
a new story mission. Wait, I'm just, I'm almost done. I'm almost done. Yeah. I'm just going to do

274
01:02:36,469 --> 01:02:41,750
some, uh, let's do some crime investigation. I got here. I'm a GCPD. There you go. All right.

275
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:49,130
So you're probably like 10 minutes away. 15 minutes. Maybe I'll solve a couple of, uh,

276
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:56,469
city crimes while I wait for you. All right. Are there any, there's one here. What's this?

277
01:02:56,469 --> 01:03:00,119
Good thing I don't need to walk in from the front door.

278
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:12,039
One of the, wonder why the cops would be on alert. Oh yeah. You, if you, if you cause like,

279
01:03:12,039 --> 01:03:17,780
like chaos and mayhem, like they're like, they get annoyed with you, but they don't,

280
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:24,260
they don't like vigilante justice. No, you only, it's a, it's a dish best served cold.

281
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:31,670
Can you do it a little deeper? It's a dish best served cold. Can you go even just a little bit

282
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:37,590
more? It's a dish best served cold. Very good, but less cookie monster, more like scary.

283
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:45,670
It's a dish best served cold. That was close. That's as far as it goes, man.

284
01:03:56,380 --> 01:04:02,920
Why am I walking? I have a car. Why am I walking to this? Oh, you upgraded from the, from the,

285
01:04:03,719 --> 01:04:11,900
Oh, well, a bicycle from the bicycle. Okay. Oh wait, upstairs door. There you go. Oh,

286
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:18,539
no, it doesn't work. German. How do I get into the GCPD? Um, unfortunately that, that was three

287
01:04:18,539 --> 01:04:24,150
days ago. So it's gone from my memory and nothing goes into long-term memory. I actually, I really

288
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:32,059
have no idea. I don't remember what I had for breakfast yesterday. You know what I mean?

289
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:42,250
It's that literal. All right, give me the car or the motorcycle. Oh no, I went the wrong way.

290
01:04:45,059 --> 01:04:53,179
I think he's just literally saying, go through the front door. You know who I am?

291
01:04:58,199 --> 01:05:11,130
One of my chats said, ask him for money. He won't remember. They really got it out for you.

292
01:05:11,130 --> 01:05:18,170
I would remember that. You say you don't remember what you have for breakfast. I like that he said,

293
01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:22,699
what am I going to do? Go through the front door. And I went into the back door. I would definitely

294
01:05:22,699 --> 01:05:28,300
put a sticky note on like, oh, hey, like Hassan owes me 50 grand or whatever. Right?

295
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:42,039
I wouldn't sticky note what I had for breakfast yesterday. Oh, German. I'm, I'm beating cops

296
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:45,690
pretty aggressively and violently. I don't know what's going on.

297
01:05:46,489 --> 01:05:53,750
Oh, the game, the game gets a little nuts. I don't know if I'm supposed to be doing that,

298
01:05:53,750 --> 01:06:00,650
but I'm kind of cops. I want to do the, uh, I want to do the like prison mission with you with like

299
01:06:00,650 --> 01:06:08,650
the, you guys chat, you guys know with the song. I w I kind of want to be pulled into your game.

300
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:20,139
It's pretty clear how to go to places and yet I'm still failing.

301
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:30,340
I already failed the mission. No, no, no, no, not at all. I just went the wrong way.

302
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:37,639
I just went the wrong way. It's okay. That's not a bad, that's not a bad guy.

303
01:06:37,639 --> 01:06:44,420
Okay. I was checking tactically, giving an ocular pat down to the other side of the car.

304
01:06:48,260 --> 01:07:34,860
Oh, wait, the bomb's going to detonate in a minute. What? Oh, oh, this is bad. I'm sorry.

305
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:39,260
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

306
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:51,659
A citizen's injured here. Medics are inbound to your location. Oh no. That was bad.

307
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:59,260
I really could have used some, uh, muscle there. I know. Well, luckily you and everyone else who

308
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:05,739
gets this game by clicking on either of our panels could potentially play cooperative and get all the

309
01:08:05,739 --> 01:08:12,920
help that they need. Pretty good. Pretty good. Right? Dude, I'm, I'm pretty cracked with it.

310
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:19,699
Did you, uh, I saw if you happen to tell anybody what platforms this could be on,

311
01:08:19,699 --> 01:08:27,819
couldn't be on, you know, uh, I did not. They're on, uh, PlayStation five, Xbox series S X and

312
01:08:28,779 --> 01:08:39,380
the PC. Got it. This has been an injury. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, there's another one over

313
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:49,300
here. So they didn't stop doing that. Oh, wait, I am in prison. Did you say prison break or no,

314
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:55,399
it's the bullpen. Uh, there's a mission after and like another 30, 40 minutes from where you are.

315
01:08:55,399 --> 01:09:06,300
That's just, um, it's a little, it's a little wild. Okay. Let me try to do this again and not

316
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:18,170
mess this whole thing up. This seems kind of hard. No, you don't. Cause you're the downed officer.

317
01:09:20,619 --> 01:09:21,420
I'll meet myself.

318
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:30,260
Is he seeing me? I don't think, I think he thinks of a statue.

319
01:09:30,899 --> 01:09:53,829
That's awesome. Why does he got Fortnite dancing? That's a literal Fortnite dance.

320
01:09:53,829 --> 01:10:01,029
He's hanging with a pretty rough. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good.

321
01:10:06,899 --> 01:10:14,699
All right. This mission is kind of hard. Oh shit.

322
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:20,340
Are the freaks gentrifying?

323
01:10:25,140 --> 01:11:08,739
Robin trouble. I'm not failing this the second time.

324
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:20,100
Thank you. There we go.

325
01:11:28,199 --> 01:11:31,960
Have you heard any reports of the freaks actively recruiting suburban types like

326
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:34,359
soccer moms or guys really into their public bites?

327
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:40,199
I wish. So wait, why are they?

328
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:47,369
So some of these people are, they're not, I don't know.

329
01:11:53,210 --> 01:11:58,739
All right, cool. So that I prevented a crime there. Good. Oh shit. I am not muted. I'm just

330
01:11:58,739 --> 01:12:03,380
talking through Hassan's stream right now. I think. Oh my God. I'm sorry. Let me fix that.

331
01:12:05,819 --> 01:12:27,060
I'm just like streaming at Hassan's stream. Get me out of here. So something going on right here.

332
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:36,199
It's okay. Jeremiah, you're making the stream, but the wrong call,

333
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:51,579
you're the wrong discord bit. I'm not going to do the wrong discord routine.

334
01:12:53,029 --> 01:12:55,909
It's not possible. And this is more than two or three people in a call together.

335
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:08,359
It just being me and Hassan on a call, my indicator is just going to light up.

336
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:20,619
Oh shit. What's going on? What are they chasing? What are they doing? Where are they going? I'm

337
01:13:20,619 --> 01:13:51,770
very, I need to see, I need to investigate this. Okay. Ooh, new move. Oh, that was good.

338
01:13:54,039 --> 01:13:57,079
I feel like a bowstaff would be fun to just like, that would be a good weapon. Right.

339
01:14:08,630 --> 01:14:19,430
So what's going on here? What's the actual crime? What? Somebody's trimming hedges

340
01:14:20,470 --> 01:14:36,069
where they shouldn't be. What is that song? Okay. So I, did I do it?

341
01:14:45,510 --> 01:14:49,319
I think it was those two people that I was chasing. I think that's what it was.

342
01:14:51,560 --> 01:15:14,279
Well, I'll take whatever that is. How do I get that? There it is. Cool. All right. There's a,

343
01:15:14,279 --> 01:15:19,800
there's an Omega crime going on over here. I'll try to do the, the red Omega crime.

344
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:27,939
It's actually going to, you know, it's going to be probably kind of funny watching the song,

345
01:15:27,939 --> 01:15:32,100
like try to do this because he's, he's just trying to get to the co-op part, right?

346
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:53,739
Doesn't have the kind of experience that we have here. So what is the issue? What's happening?

347
01:15:53,739 --> 01:16:07,619
What does it say on the map? You see PD report. Uh, okay. So we'll have to go report to

348
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:33,100
stolen goods being moved. Robin is silent. All right. So I got to scan the, what is all that?

349
01:16:33,659 --> 01:16:42,539
Okay. Camera control panel. All right. Disable those cameras. This is a Batgirl mission.

350
01:16:49,960 --> 01:17:22,069
Oh, come on. He's bugging out. Oh, wait. Where's it? Where's the organ? Where's the organ?

351
01:17:45,500 --> 01:18:14,039
Yes. Get out of the way. All right. What do I deliver this to? Right there. All right. Turn

352
01:18:14,039 --> 01:18:24,460
around. Where's the song? Uh, he's currently, uh, getting to the point where he can play the

353
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:46,729
multiplayer. What are you doing over here? Wait, what? This is bad. I got to turn it in to here.

354
01:18:46,729 --> 01:19:04,390
I have 17 seconds. Make it count. Robin, don't do a flourish. Oh my God.

355
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:24,760
Had to do the flourish. You got an expiring organ in your pocket and you got to do the,

356
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:43,989
the spin jump swing. Oh, I may have gotten stuck under the, the, uh, sign. How did I do this to

357
01:19:43,989 --> 01:20:08,260
myself? I must've gotten into the perfect. Okay. I can just fast travel. Well, I hook what I'm

358
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:25,720
playing is Robin. Yeah. Gotham Knights. There was more to that sense. Oh, we have a cut scene.

359
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:34,789
This is a Robin cut scene. Let's check it out. I was surprised. There's no way the penguin does

360
01:20:34,789 --> 01:20:42,520
not double cross. Like, I mean, zero percent chance. All right. Let's see what this, uh,

361
01:20:42,520 --> 01:21:01,079
cut scene is. Playing with a ghost, Alfred. You might say that I'm finishing my last game with

362
01:21:01,079 --> 01:21:09,340
Bruce. This is kind of sad. I couldn't save our board from the manor, but I do have our notes.

363
01:21:11,539 --> 01:21:18,520
We tracked each move. All right. I think I'm in, I'm in, uh, Belfry tutorial ending patrol.

364
01:21:19,399 --> 01:21:27,000
I think night one crime stop zero citizens rescue too. I feel like that's more important. You know

365
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:31,399
what I mean? What good is stopping crime if you're not saving citizens? Oh, there's another mini,

366
01:21:32,279 --> 01:21:52,409
another cut scene. Yeah. Uh, watch that cut scene and we'll, we'll, okay. Are you winning playing

367
01:21:52,409 --> 01:22:03,720
as Bruce? I can't see how he loses. Bruce is dead. Maybe he wins your game, but without him,

368
01:22:04,359 --> 01:22:18,500
I'm not so sure about that. Not so sure he's dead. Not so sure we've lost. Bruce played an important

369
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:32,949
role, but he never saw himself as the only piece in play. I mean, take a little bit of credit,

370
01:22:32,949 --> 01:22:43,739
Robin. Like you, you are, you are just as good. You are a good superhero and you got your own

371
01:22:43,739 --> 01:22:47,420
shit going on. And let's, you know, let's watch another cut scene because this is another one

372
01:22:47,420 --> 01:23:42,819
here. This is bike one. That green slime hurt Jason. When I fell from heaven, when you came

373
01:23:42,819 --> 01:23:52,250
back to life, he just screwed that in with his bare hands. He didn't even need a wrench. It changed

374
01:23:52,250 --> 01:24:04,840
me. Hey, Lazarus isn't going to bring Bruce back to who's to say he doesn't want us to try.

375
01:24:07,479 --> 01:24:25,449
Oh, he wants to break. Okay. I see what's happening here. Okay. Bruce isn't this bike. You

376
01:24:25,449 --> 01:24:29,210
can't just change everything out and expect things to work like they did.

377
01:24:30,170 --> 01:25:15,899
Then what am I supposed to do? Try grieving. What? He's locked. I want that one. I want this one.

378
01:25:15,899 --> 01:25:27,590
I want this one bad. I want this one. I want this one bad. I want this one real bad. I want this one.

379
01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:50,710
How do I buy these? I want this one. Oh my God. I want this one so bad. They're all locked. All

380
01:25:50,710 --> 01:26:02,180
right. Do I? What's next? What's the main story mission that I have? I have this. The Penguin.

381
01:26:02,180 --> 01:26:11,050
Penguin is available. This Court of Owls thing is available. Dr. Jada Tompkins is available.

382
01:26:11,609 --> 01:26:22,779
I wonder how close the sound is. I want to start something major. Hey, what's your,

383
01:26:22,779 --> 01:26:28,489
what do you got for an ETA? You think you're pretty close? Yeah. I'm talking, I'm having a

384
01:26:28,489 --> 01:26:33,529
moment with Alfred right now. Okay. I'll shut up. He's crying about Bruce dying. Did you know Bruce

385
01:26:33,529 --> 01:26:41,770
Wayne is Batman? I mean, I heard that. Did I spoil? Did I spoil everything? I'm sorry.

386
01:26:41,770 --> 01:26:47,640
I don't know. Do you mean like the billionaire of Bruce Wayne? What? Yeah. Billionaire Bruce

387
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:57,430
Wayne is Batman. Oh, okay. Oh no. Chat's saying major spoilers, dude. Damn it. I thought,

388
01:27:03,380 --> 01:27:09,979
it's time to craft. Okay. I need to complete, prepare for patrol and complete interrogation

389
01:27:09,979 --> 01:27:19,109
training. And I think after that, I suspect I will be able to, I guess like I have to complete

390
01:27:19,109 --> 01:27:24,579
interrogation training. And then after that, maybe. I think that's it. I think that's the one.

391
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:37,939
Dude, I'm making a legendary slingshot. I'm trying to upgrade my guns, man. Yeah. You get a crap.

392
01:27:37,939 --> 01:27:40,659
You can go to the workbench when you have a chance. You might have something you can make.

393
01:27:41,779 --> 01:27:45,220
Yeah. It's just gun level one though. Oh, you can switch right here.

394
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:59,100
I think it's time to switch to Nightwing. Pick somebody else. Pick a different character.

395
01:28:00,619 --> 01:28:05,899
Okay. Yeah. Nightwing's like dumb. That's not even like a fun. It's like, I play as Nightwing

396
01:28:05,899 --> 01:28:11,159
sometimes, but like, usually I'm the Nightwing guy. I'm like the Nightwing streamer. Oh, you're

397
01:28:11,159 --> 01:28:15,720
the Nightwing guy. Okay. I'll just keep, I'll stay with Red Hood. It's fine. No, you don't,

398
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:19,479
you don't have to. No, no, no. It's cool, man. No, you don't do, you don't have to. It's my

399
01:28:19,479 --> 01:28:26,520
first time playing the game. I guess. No, I don't know. Okay. No. Yeah. All right. Yeah. If you

400
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:31,800
insist, I'll just stay with the Jarhead haircut. It's fine. Okay. This is advanced training,

401
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:35,079
ability training and basic training. It says learn interrogation training, but I don't know where

402
01:28:35,079 --> 01:28:40,619
that would be. Is that in advanced? Okay. And I had, okay, let me show you. So if you go over

403
01:28:40,619 --> 01:28:46,699
to the training dummy, go to the training dummy. I found it. There it is. It takes about two minutes

404
01:28:46,699 --> 01:28:52,659
and be ready because it's cool. Here it comes. You're going to go. Holy shit. Physical and mental

405
01:28:52,659 --> 01:28:58,020
preservation go hand in hand. Oh, Batman's alive. As a young child, I didn't want to say it. They

406
01:28:58,020 --> 01:29:06,380
were behind his parents. Okay. It must not be Bruce Wayne then because Bruce Wayne is dead.

407
01:29:06,380 --> 01:29:25,000
Spoilers. I think this on is very close. I think I have enough time to do one more small crime.

408
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:37,619
I mean, prevent one more small crime. It's better. Wait, that's it. I just said,

409
01:29:37,619 --> 01:29:41,939
tell me what I want to know. And he said, cat don't got this tongue. I'll tell you what you

410
01:29:41,939 --> 01:29:45,220
want to know. Then we'll be free to fly to and from this neighborhood as much as we want.

411
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:50,920
That's a surveillance drone. Scan each one in the sector and send me the data.

412
01:29:52,199 --> 01:29:55,000
Then we'll be free to fly to and from this neighborhood as much as we want.

413
01:29:55,960 --> 01:30:06,489
Once I reprogram them to look the other way. Yes. In the drone. Where's this drone that he's

414
01:30:06,489 --> 01:30:21,880
talking about? Oh my God. Batman said I've come so far. Okay. So when I exit, oh no,

415
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:28,550
now I can play multiplayer. Let's go. Hold on. Let's switch over to multiplayer. Oh,

416
01:30:28,550 --> 01:30:36,149
is this quick math? Main story, heroic assault, main story, right? I would assume. Yeah.

417
01:30:36,789 --> 01:30:43,189
I think that's a waiting to join. Are you just joining me? I don't know. Are you? Did you host

418
01:30:43,189 --> 01:30:52,359
me? No. It said joining host. Did you just join a random game? I don't know. Who, man? Wait, what?

419
01:30:53,399 --> 01:30:59,670
I've joined a random person. Random person's game. I don't know how that happened. Oh,

420
01:30:59,670 --> 01:31:05,880
because I think you did quick play. Did I? I think. Hold on. Let me, let me investigate this.

421
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:16,060
Let me do some investigation here. Oh, I should go to social, game invites, friends. There it is.

422
01:31:17,260 --> 01:31:27,180
Theme friends. There it is. And then you. Yes, can. Wait, did I actually accept your friend

423
01:31:27,180 --> 01:31:35,159
request? I thought I did. Did you not? Awkward. But you didn't accept my friend request. I just,

424
01:31:35,159 --> 01:31:41,590
I just accepted it. Yeah, because you were forced to on stream. Oh, that's awkward, man. That's

425
01:31:41,670 --> 01:31:49,289
kind of whatever. I guess I'll just join you right now. I might as well. Sorry about that.

426
01:31:52,779 --> 01:32:03,750
Oh, there you are. Oh, hold on. Hold up. Did it not work? Oh, I'm here. There you are.

427
01:32:03,750 --> 01:32:10,819
Gas can has joined the chat. OK, I got to come find you. Yeah, you are really far away.

428
01:32:11,699 --> 01:32:16,340
Wait, really? We can look, look at, look at how far away we can be. I don't think it's going to

429
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:27,319
ever. No, I'm Robin. Oh, OK, that is way drippier. You look like Legend of Zelda, Robin. I look cool.

430
01:32:28,359 --> 01:32:33,260
You hold on. The other Robin looked so, you know, about the other character in the game.

431
01:32:33,260 --> 01:32:35,739
This is like there's a bunch of characters here. I'll show you one.

432
01:32:36,539 --> 01:32:43,699
Um, is, uh, what's his name? Watch out. Who's that? What's his name? Um,

433
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:50,489
bald boy. Right. I forgot. Wait, what? What is this? It's bald boy. It's another Batman.

434
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:56,859
How did you change your character so swiftly? You would, you know, you don't know bald boy is.

435
01:32:58,659 --> 01:33:05,720
No, you wait. You, you know who Batman is, but you don't know who bald boy is.

436
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:10,520
Oh, who's bald? That's all right. You're trolling. Does the train ever come?

437
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:13,560
Like, I feel like we'd get cooked if a train just decided to.

438
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:19,939
Wait, where are you going? All right. We don't. Whose mission are we on? Are we on mine or yours?

439
01:33:20,739 --> 01:33:24,500
No, it would be yours, I think. All right. So let's go. Let's let me mark something.

440
01:33:26,180 --> 01:33:34,550
Let's do. Wait, I can change my suits, uh, dial in in many. No, I can't. I think I'm about to spoil

441
01:33:34,550 --> 01:33:39,590
like the first third of the game for you, by the way. It's OK. Because we're about to go talk to

442
01:33:39,590 --> 01:33:45,210
a certain character. I'm down to do the mission with you. All right, let's go. Let's do we both

443
01:33:45,289 --> 01:33:52,090
have like, it seems like you need the help. Oh, or wait, do I get on your back? I don't know.

444
01:33:52,090 --> 01:33:57,939
Let's find out. It won't let me. Do you have to have your own? Oh, you have your own bike.

445
01:33:57,939 --> 01:34:01,619
I wish I could just like, yeah, I wish I could mount your bike with you.

446
01:34:03,060 --> 01:34:09,909
All right, let's go. You got to ride a wheelie the whole time. That's part of it.

447
01:34:10,630 --> 01:34:24,420
OK, we're like the. Whoa. This is the reason why Eric Adams said no more motorbikes in New York

448
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:27,779
City, by the way, because of this kind of behavior that we're engaging in.

449
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:34,409
You're doing pretty good. The little political joke, a little political.

450
01:34:34,409 --> 01:34:39,939
Was that a political joke? Yeah. One of the.

451
01:34:42,659 --> 01:34:46,659
I don't know where you're going. Oh, excuse me.

452
01:34:48,420 --> 01:34:52,569
You just used me as a jump. That was pretty cool. I did that on purpose.

453
01:34:52,569 --> 01:34:54,409
Actually, that was sick. All right. Let's get on.

454
01:34:55,210 --> 01:35:00,970
You might have thought that I was actually scared, but really, I was just doing it as a joke.

455
01:35:02,329 --> 01:35:07,289
I love how you're in character. Oh, yeah. Wait, hold on, hold on.

456
01:35:08,250 --> 01:35:10,970
I think I'm going to turn you up. Let me I'm going to go to gear.

457
01:35:10,970 --> 01:35:13,369
I'm going to go to gear. Oh, my God, I can change my suit.

458
01:35:15,939 --> 01:35:18,020
You got a better suit. Beyond.

459
01:35:19,430 --> 01:35:22,229
We both look like henchmen of.

460
01:35:23,189 --> 01:35:26,180
What is the red hood beyond suit look like?

461
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:34,279
Pretty cool. I think I've seen it.

462
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:38,739
All right, so we're going to go over here, so hop off the bikes.

463
01:35:38,739 --> 01:35:45,270
We're going up there and we're going to visit a particular character.

464
01:35:52,939 --> 01:35:55,659
I don't know what I did. Where are you?

465
01:35:55,659 --> 01:36:00,149
We got to go in the ceiling. Oh, God.

466
01:36:08,939 --> 01:36:11,899
What? I can't get to you. I don't know why.

467
01:36:11,899 --> 01:36:13,020
No, you're right here. You're right here.

468
01:36:13,819 --> 01:36:16,460
I know, but won't let me jump up there for some reason.

469
01:36:18,550 --> 01:36:21,350
So yeah, jump right down here. There you are.

470
01:36:23,109 --> 01:36:25,750
All right. Just duck and roll, baby.

471
01:36:26,869 --> 01:36:28,710
Oh, he's just right here. Get him.

472
01:36:28,710 --> 01:36:31,029
Oh, what? Dude, spoilers.

473
01:36:31,029 --> 01:36:33,350
Watch out. He's got grenades and shit. Watch out.

474
01:36:34,149 --> 01:36:35,829
Wait, really? No.

475
01:36:39,510 --> 01:36:40,470
Are you seeing this cut scene?

476
01:36:42,220 --> 01:36:43,899
No, I'm just hearing him talk to you.

477
01:36:45,659 --> 01:36:47,100
Can you walk behind me? Like, get behind me.

478
01:36:47,739 --> 01:36:50,920
What do you want? Straight to the point.

479
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:53,000
Like, will you just appear in the cut scene?

480
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:56,199
So how's about a little part? I'm behind you.

481
01:36:57,300 --> 01:36:58,979
I'm too young to run about. No, you're not there.

482
01:36:58,979 --> 01:37:00,979
And I don't have a fake ID either.

483
01:37:00,979 --> 01:37:06,899
You misunderstand me, friend. As the owner of a respected establishment,

484
01:37:06,899 --> 01:37:09,220
I have an interest in keeping the streets safe.

485
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:13,369
You could help. What's your angle?

486
01:37:14,090 --> 01:37:16,010
Are you hoping I'll take out some of your competitors?

487
01:37:16,010 --> 01:37:18,250
Speaking of angles, you should probably angle the umbrella up.

488
01:37:18,489 --> 01:37:20,970
I'm not in the crime business anymore. So you don't get rained on.

489
01:37:20,970 --> 01:37:26,810
So if I can't cross any unusual gear, I'd be obliged to turn it over.

490
01:37:26,810 --> 01:37:28,489
Upstanding citizen that I am.

491
01:37:29,850 --> 01:37:33,770
You're lucky they're criminals, or I wouldn't even consider it.

492
01:37:34,789 --> 01:37:37,909
Well, that's the spirit. You're working with crimers?

493
01:37:38,949 --> 01:37:42,869
Sometimes you have to work with information.

494
01:37:42,869 --> 01:37:44,789
That's my response to you. You see that?

495
01:37:44,789 --> 01:37:49,399
What about my response? Wait, do you see my emotes?

496
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:54,789
Wait, I don't... What are you, rock, paper, scissoring?

497
01:37:54,789 --> 01:37:55,430
I don't get it.

498
01:37:55,430 --> 01:37:56,710
Yeah. All right. Let's rock, paper, scissors.

499
01:37:57,350 --> 01:37:59,319
So if you select the emotes and then do...

500
01:37:59,319 --> 01:38:00,439
Good job. Good job.

501
01:38:01,159 --> 01:38:02,279
Wait, I can't do another emote?

502
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:06,439
I don't think I have rock, paper, scissors.

503
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:11,220
No. All right. So now we have to go from here.

504
01:38:13,060 --> 01:38:16,069
And... Okay.

505
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:20,619
They're kind of rude of Mr. Penguin not to even acknowledge my existence,

506
01:38:20,619 --> 01:38:21,659
but that's okay, I guess.

507
01:38:22,619 --> 01:38:24,539
Oh, his name is Mr. Penguin.

508
01:38:25,930 --> 01:38:28,170
That actually makes him way less intimidating to me.

509
01:38:29,930 --> 01:38:33,609
Oh, Mr. Penguin. Mr. Penguin to me is like an actual penguin

510
01:38:33,609 --> 01:38:36,569
that's like the animal with the stripe on his stomach and stuff.

511
01:38:36,569 --> 01:38:39,770
Mr. Penguin. That's not the penguin. Penguin is scary.

512
01:38:41,479 --> 01:38:43,479
Wait, this guy's not the penguin?

513
01:38:43,479 --> 01:38:45,800
No, he is. But like, you called him Mr. Penguin.

514
01:38:46,859 --> 01:38:49,420
Yeah. Mr. Penguin was my father's name.

515
01:38:50,939 --> 01:38:52,939
I'm just the regular old penguin.

516
01:38:52,939 --> 01:38:54,060
All right. Where are we going?

517
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:56,060
We're going to go this way. We're going to do the owl stuff.

518
01:38:56,779 --> 01:39:00,300
I'm not going to lie. This is giving Spider-Man a little bit.

519
01:39:01,739 --> 01:39:04,779
With our suits. I don't know if I'm allowed to say that.

520
01:39:04,779 --> 01:39:06,460
That's a different franchise entirely.

521
01:39:06,460 --> 01:39:09,739
This is Gotham Knights. This is the DC Universe's Gotham Knights

522
01:39:10,300 --> 01:39:15,659
starring Batman, Robin, Batgirl, and of course, who could forget Red Hood?

523
01:39:16,619 --> 01:39:17,979
All right. We should get on a bike.

524
01:39:18,779 --> 01:39:20,939
All right. Get on a bike.

525
01:39:21,819 --> 01:39:23,420
So we're going to go through here.

526
01:39:26,579 --> 01:39:28,100
I'm curious how the gameplay is.

527
01:39:28,899 --> 01:39:35,130
So what difficulty are you playing?

528
01:39:35,770 --> 01:39:39,369
I was on hard, but I was kind of getting my ass kicked, so I put it to normal.

529
01:39:40,180 --> 01:39:41,539
Oh, yeah. I'm on medium.

530
01:39:41,539 --> 01:39:43,060
The big enemies are horrible.

531
01:39:43,779 --> 01:39:50,470
If you play the game on hard, the huge enemies, they're just so tanky.

532
01:39:51,350 --> 01:39:52,390
They're really difficult to kill.

533
01:39:53,189 --> 01:39:55,340
All right. We're going right in this building up here.

534
01:39:58,630 --> 01:40:01,460
So we're going to find a secret door.

535
01:40:01,460 --> 01:40:02,180
Do you have this on the map?

536
01:40:03,380 --> 01:40:05,850
I think I found the secret door.

537
01:40:09,289 --> 01:40:10,090
Hammer right here.

538
01:40:11,689 --> 01:40:13,449
Oh my God. I think you actually found it.

539
01:40:14,170 --> 01:40:17,220
We can just take out the cameras.

540
01:40:18,329 --> 01:40:19,130
How do you take them out?

541
01:40:19,850 --> 01:40:24,250
If you hold left trigger, you can aim and then you can use right trigger to shoot.

542
01:40:28,659 --> 01:40:29,220
Good to know.

543
01:40:30,020 --> 01:40:30,979
All right. I'm turning this off.

544
01:40:33,050 --> 01:40:35,529
Wait, crime resolved, secret identity compromised?

545
01:40:36,970 --> 01:40:37,609
What?

546
01:40:37,609 --> 01:40:38,890
That might have been a side mission.

547
01:40:40,020 --> 01:40:42,260
Thanks for helping me complete my side mission, Hasan.

548
01:40:42,899 --> 01:40:43,779
That's crazy.

549
01:40:43,779 --> 01:40:45,460
I just compromised someone's secret identity.

550
01:40:45,460 --> 01:40:46,260
He's kind of messed up.

551
01:40:47,609 --> 01:40:48,329
He just doxxed.

552
01:40:49,930 --> 01:40:51,770
I think we have to go down the front door.

553
01:40:52,970 --> 01:40:54,090
Wait, no way.

554
01:40:54,090 --> 01:40:54,409
Hey.

555
01:40:54,409 --> 01:40:55,449
Oh, no, I'm falling.

556
01:40:56,170 --> 01:40:56,810
Look what I found.

557
01:40:57,529 --> 01:40:59,750
This looks pretty secret, doesn't it?

558
01:40:59,750 --> 01:41:01,109
This is a secret door, I think.

559
01:41:01,109 --> 01:41:01,670
Open this.

560
01:41:02,310 --> 01:41:05,100
I suggest it to you, the host.

561
01:41:05,739 --> 01:41:07,430
I mean, I am Robin.

562
01:41:07,430 --> 01:41:08,390
I'm an engineer.

563
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:15,159
Wait, who did you say that to?

564
01:41:15,159 --> 01:41:17,319
Why are you speaking to yourself in the third person?

565
01:41:17,319 --> 01:41:18,119
Whoa, chill.

566
01:41:18,119 --> 01:41:18,840
PvP, let's go.

567
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:21,109
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

568
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:24,979
Fucking double agent for the owls.

569
01:41:24,979 --> 01:41:27,779
I mean, I'm shooting the heck out of you right now.

570
01:41:27,779 --> 01:41:30,659
So all right, let's go.

571
01:41:34,659 --> 01:41:36,340
You have other suits in the styles tab.

572
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:37,220
Wait, hold on.

573
01:41:37,220 --> 01:41:38,659
But let me look at it real quick.

574
01:41:39,380 --> 01:41:42,899
Oh, there's different colorways.

575
01:41:42,899 --> 01:41:44,579
Stop playing with me.

576
01:41:48,359 --> 01:41:49,399
You have points to put in, too.

577
01:41:49,399 --> 01:41:50,359
If you look through the skill tree.

578
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:54,439
Nice.

579
01:41:54,439 --> 01:41:56,119
Oh, the shinobi one.

580
01:41:56,119 --> 01:41:58,119
But transmog suit is locked.

581
01:41:59,350 --> 01:42:00,789
Strange location for it.

582
01:42:00,789 --> 01:42:06,010
I'll see what I can find.

583
01:42:06,010 --> 01:42:08,569
Okay, these suits are sick, but it won't let me.

584
01:42:10,699 --> 01:42:13,979
I can only get I can only apply a transmog

585
01:42:13,979 --> 01:42:15,020
to the new guard.

586
01:42:15,020 --> 01:42:17,659
I don't know what that means, but I can't get

587
01:42:20,170 --> 01:42:22,090
I can't get night ops or shinobi.

588
01:42:23,899 --> 01:42:25,420
I think I need to craft different gear.

589
01:42:26,220 --> 01:42:32,710
This one's fine.

590
01:42:32,710 --> 01:42:33,270
All right, you're good.

591
01:42:34,710 --> 01:42:35,109
All right.

592
01:42:37,380 --> 01:42:38,420
I'm good, gas can.

593
01:42:39,140 --> 01:42:41,800
I think we have to solve there's probably a puzzle in here.

594
01:42:42,779 --> 01:42:45,500
Oh, this isn't this isn't the mission.

595
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:46,000
Yeah.

596
01:42:47,159 --> 01:42:48,119
Oh, it is the mission.

597
01:42:48,119 --> 01:42:49,319
Okay, letter box.

598
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:52,119
We should probably look for to scan some documents here.

599
01:42:53,340 --> 01:42:53,899
Moreno.

600
01:42:54,779 --> 01:42:56,460
I feel like I know that name.

601
01:42:56,460 --> 01:42:57,100
Me too.

602
01:42:57,100 --> 01:43:00,140
Belfry, we have an open case file on the Moreno murder.

603
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:00,859
Can you look it up?

604
01:43:01,899 --> 01:43:02,939
Case files.

605
01:43:02,939 --> 01:43:06,380
The brother of Elena Moreno, a local judge.

606
01:43:06,380 --> 01:43:08,539
She took a leave of absence from the bench

607
01:43:08,539 --> 01:43:11,420
directly afterward for family reasons.

608
01:43:11,420 --> 01:43:13,739
That's what would happen if you gave a camera to a monkey.

609
01:43:16,199 --> 01:43:18,520
I actually think a monkey would probably turn the camera

610
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:20,279
and just be like taking pictures in its face.

611
01:43:21,670 --> 01:43:23,189
I'm investigating this.

612
01:43:23,189 --> 01:43:23,909
The West End.

613
01:43:23,909 --> 01:43:26,310
This peg points east towards the hospital.

614
01:43:26,869 --> 01:43:27,430
Okay.

615
01:43:27,430 --> 01:43:28,949
This peg points northeast.

616
01:43:30,779 --> 01:43:31,180
Interesting.

617
01:43:31,180 --> 01:43:33,340
There's a card.

618
01:43:33,340 --> 01:43:35,180
This takes me to be in old English.

619
01:43:35,180 --> 01:43:39,340
AR scan analysis indicates means purge.

620
01:43:39,899 --> 01:43:43,100
The rest of the text says kill all those who trespass.

621
01:43:43,100 --> 01:43:46,949
This image matches the one on the second order.

622
01:43:46,949 --> 01:43:47,189
All right.

623
01:43:47,189 --> 01:43:49,109
So what means threatened?

624
01:43:49,109 --> 01:43:51,590
The rest of the text says, make them fear us.

625
01:43:51,590 --> 01:43:52,710
Well, we need to figure out.

626
01:43:52,789 --> 01:43:56,010
So we need to figure out where the target is

627
01:43:56,010 --> 01:43:57,529
and what the instructions are.

628
01:43:57,529 --> 01:43:59,289
And you have to piece two pieces of evidence together.

629
01:43:59,289 --> 01:44:01,750
Do you think we can handle that?

630
01:44:01,750 --> 01:44:02,250
Okay.

631
01:44:03,430 --> 01:44:06,710
There's another one that says kill the target.

632
01:44:06,710 --> 01:44:08,789
And then there's one that says near way,

633
01:44:08,789 --> 01:44:10,229
which means constrained or confined.

634
01:44:10,229 --> 01:44:12,390
The rest of the text says, take them prisoner.

635
01:44:12,390 --> 01:44:12,630
Okay.

636
01:44:12,630 --> 01:44:15,289
So we're going to try kill the target.

637
01:44:15,289 --> 01:44:18,199
And what do we know so far?

638
01:44:18,199 --> 01:44:20,199
I have no idea what this mission is.

639
01:44:20,199 --> 01:44:21,079
I'm supposed to be the brains.

640
01:44:21,079 --> 01:44:21,960
I'm supposed to be the brains.

641
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:22,520
That's my bad.

642
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:23,399
You're supposed to be the brains.

643
01:44:23,399 --> 01:44:24,119
What's going on?

644
01:44:24,119 --> 01:44:25,319
There's an owl dagger here.

645
01:44:25,319 --> 01:44:27,380
Maybe we use that to kill the target.

646
01:44:27,380 --> 01:44:30,439
I think they're going to use the order to kill.

647
01:44:33,210 --> 01:44:35,560
They want to kill somebody at Gotham River.

648
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:36,840
I messed up.

649
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:37,640
I spilled coffee.

650
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:38,840
I love my controller for a second.

651
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:41,210
I didn't mean to do that.

652
01:44:41,210 --> 01:44:44,819
The order is to kill.

653
01:44:44,819 --> 01:44:47,670
Let's see.

654
01:44:47,670 --> 01:44:49,750
Symbols are different from the previous document,

655
01:44:49,750 --> 01:44:52,149
but it seemed to indicate a command and a location.

656
01:44:52,149 --> 01:44:53,020
Okay.

657
01:44:53,020 --> 01:44:55,699
It looks like there is a kill there.

658
01:44:55,699 --> 01:44:58,260
And it looks like that location is possibly.

659
01:44:59,319 --> 01:45:00,840
I would have deduced this.

660
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:05,699
The order is to purge because the swords line up there.

661
01:45:05,699 --> 01:45:08,659
Purge the river.

662
01:45:08,659 --> 01:45:09,779
Thank you very much.

663
01:45:09,779 --> 01:45:17,210
Brains of the operation.

664
01:45:17,210 --> 01:45:17,529
Okay.

665
01:45:17,529 --> 01:45:18,489
What happened?

666
01:45:18,489 --> 01:45:21,850
Looks like the court gave a purge order to the Chelsea tunnel.

667
01:45:22,649 --> 01:45:24,890
So by the way, I'm not going to fight any enemies.

668
01:45:24,890 --> 01:45:25,689
That's for you to do.

669
01:45:25,689 --> 01:45:27,369
Was declared unsafe.

670
01:45:27,930 --> 01:45:29,979
That seems convenient.

671
01:45:29,979 --> 01:45:32,819
The court of owls must have something hidden down there.

672
01:45:33,859 --> 01:45:34,739
Heading that way now.

673
01:45:36,020 --> 01:45:36,420
It's so funny.

674
01:45:36,420 --> 01:45:39,159
You could have just like walked.

675
01:45:39,159 --> 01:45:41,399
No, I rule in style.

676
01:45:42,039 --> 01:45:44,649
What's your favorite Batman?

677
01:45:45,529 --> 01:45:47,750
Dude, I don't know.

678
01:45:50,779 --> 01:45:52,859
I mean, obviously the dark knight is, you know,

679
01:45:52,859 --> 01:45:53,899
that's got to be up there, right?

680
01:45:55,369 --> 01:45:57,289
I know that I didn't like the last one.

681
01:45:58,649 --> 01:45:59,930
I didn't even see the last one.

682
01:46:00,819 --> 01:46:01,699
That's crazy.

683
01:46:01,699 --> 01:46:03,140
I really probably wanted to.

684
01:46:03,140 --> 01:46:04,180
It's very angsty.

685
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:07,079
I think the original Batman cartoon.

686
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:09,479
Bro, you are cooking right now.

687
01:46:09,479 --> 01:46:12,439
I don't know how I'm not able to go as fast as you.

688
01:46:12,439 --> 01:46:12,920
Oh, all right.

689
01:46:12,920 --> 01:46:15,479
So right before you land, it's going to say,

690
01:46:15,479 --> 01:46:16,439
oh, jump.

691
01:46:16,439 --> 01:46:17,640
You essentially want to time it.

692
01:46:17,640 --> 01:46:20,039
So maybe like a half second before you land.

693
01:46:20,039 --> 01:46:20,920
No, I got it.

694
01:46:20,920 --> 01:46:21,159
Yeah.

695
01:46:21,880 --> 01:46:23,659
All right.

696
01:46:23,659 --> 01:46:24,539
So what is down here?

697
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:26,220
We got something here.

698
01:46:27,100 --> 01:46:30,810
Lower level, maybe.

699
01:46:31,369 --> 01:46:36,180
What are we looking for?

700
01:46:36,739 --> 01:46:42,520
The court went to great lengths to halt construction at the Chelsea tunnel.

701
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:44,600
Investigate the construction site to uncover what they...

702
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:45,479
This is like level.

703
01:46:46,199 --> 01:46:48,439
We're kind of under level for this, but whatever we can do it.

704
01:46:49,079 --> 01:46:51,800
Dude, you got me on your side.

705
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:52,840
I'm the greatest carry.

706
01:46:53,399 --> 01:46:54,600
Don't worry about a thing.

707
01:46:56,149 --> 01:46:57,270
We have to find the entrance in here.

708
01:47:00,630 --> 01:47:01,189
Maybe lower.

709
01:47:03,670 --> 01:47:04,949
I'm going one step further.

710
01:47:05,670 --> 01:47:06,390
Oh, it's a tunnel.

711
01:47:06,390 --> 01:47:06,710
Okay.

712
01:47:07,270 --> 01:47:11,500
I think it's the tunnel.

713
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:11,739
Yeah.

714
01:47:15,899 --> 01:47:17,420
I want to see your combat prowess.

715
01:47:17,420 --> 01:47:18,779
I want to see how good you are at this.

716
01:47:18,779 --> 01:47:19,420
Oh, no.

717
01:47:21,539 --> 01:47:22,180
Secret entrance?

718
01:47:28,659 --> 01:47:28,899
Easy.

719
01:47:28,899 --> 01:47:32,600
Looks accurate, right?

720
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:33,479
Here we go.

721
01:47:33,479 --> 01:47:34,199
That was pretty sick.

722
01:47:34,199 --> 01:47:34,439
All right.

723
01:47:34,439 --> 01:47:35,800
Oh, they say we miss you, buddy.

724
01:47:36,439 --> 01:47:43,050
We did?

725
01:47:43,050 --> 01:47:43,609
Oh, here it is.

726
01:47:46,979 --> 01:47:49,380
I've suggested it to you, the host.

727
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:50,100
I think we...

728
01:47:50,100 --> 01:47:51,140
Yeah, we can teleport in.

729
01:47:59,369 --> 01:48:01,609
Between the two of us, we can figure this out.

730
01:48:02,250 --> 01:48:03,289
I'm in the tunnel.

731
01:48:03,289 --> 01:48:07,050
Looks like they hit some kind of chasm during construction.

732
01:48:07,050 --> 01:48:08,569
Maybe we're going to fight like aliens or something.

733
01:48:08,569 --> 01:48:09,930
Chances are we'll lose comms down there.

734
01:48:09,930 --> 01:48:10,489
I'll check in as soon as I can.

735
01:48:10,489 --> 01:48:13,850
Jerma, they want me to ask if you're the sus guy.

736
01:48:14,409 --> 01:48:15,369
You already knew that.

737
01:48:16,420 --> 01:48:17,539
You're the sus guy, right?

738
01:48:17,539 --> 01:48:18,180
Yeah, you knew that.

739
01:48:22,819 --> 01:48:23,140
All right.

740
01:48:23,140 --> 01:48:26,310
So I think we're probably going to end up fighting a bunch of stuff down here.

741
01:48:27,420 --> 01:48:29,369
Oh, okay.

742
01:48:29,369 --> 01:48:29,930
I'm ready.

743
01:48:30,899 --> 01:48:33,380
I got the Glock and the Rari.

744
01:48:34,100 --> 01:48:35,060
1738.

745
01:48:35,779 --> 01:48:36,659
It's stalking me.

746
01:48:36,659 --> 01:48:37,539
I don't think it's human.

747
01:48:37,539 --> 01:48:39,539
It's the last message this phone received.

748
01:48:39,539 --> 01:48:40,500
Okay, I'm going in.

749
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:41,779
You stay out there.

750
01:48:41,779 --> 01:48:42,899
You stay safe, soldier.

751
01:48:44,659 --> 01:48:48,260
I hate tight spaces because I'm such a big muscly guy.

752
01:48:55,239 --> 01:48:57,560
I have no idea if I'm going in the right direction.

753
01:48:57,560 --> 01:48:58,039
You are.

754
01:48:58,039 --> 01:48:58,520
I think so.

755
01:48:59,159 --> 01:49:01,609
You're the brains of this operation.

756
01:49:01,609 --> 01:49:02,409
I'm just the brawn.

757
01:49:08,729 --> 01:49:10,489
Okay, cutscene unlocked.

758
01:49:10,489 --> 01:49:12,329
Do you have a cutscene too or is that just me?

759
01:49:12,329 --> 01:49:13,609
Yeah, I'm watching you.

760
01:49:13,609 --> 01:49:15,050
I just saw that weird alien person.

761
01:49:16,550 --> 01:49:17,189
Okay.

762
01:49:17,189 --> 01:49:17,750
Where are you?

763
01:49:20,199 --> 01:49:20,600
Whoa.

764
01:49:21,560 --> 01:49:22,649
Watch out.

765
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:26,380
You're ugly.

766
01:49:27,020 --> 01:49:32,899
I just got a bloodborne villain.

767
01:49:32,899 --> 01:49:33,539
I thought you were good.

768
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:37,960
You just got knocked down by a random putty.

769
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:39,560
That was a cutscene, okay?

770
01:49:39,560 --> 01:49:42,039
You just got knocked down by a putty from the Power Rangers, dude.

771
01:49:42,039 --> 01:49:42,520
Come on, man.

772
01:49:47,300 --> 01:49:47,779
Oh, God.

773
01:49:50,340 --> 01:49:52,020
Okay, I can't even land a hit on him.

774
01:49:52,020 --> 01:49:52,579
Come on, get him.

775
01:49:53,140 --> 01:49:53,539
You got it.

776
01:49:55,539 --> 01:49:55,859
What?

777
01:49:56,579 --> 01:49:58,020
He's dodging everything, Jerma.

778
01:49:58,020 --> 01:49:59,779
I mean, are you pressing X?

779
01:50:02,119 --> 01:50:04,520
Press X and you got to string X together.

780
01:50:05,319 --> 01:50:07,140
Wait, press X?

781
01:50:07,140 --> 01:50:07,539
Yeah, X.

782
01:50:07,539 --> 01:50:08,340
What does X do?

783
01:50:08,340 --> 01:50:09,300
X, X, X, X.

784
01:50:10,180 --> 01:50:12,619
What does X do?

785
01:50:12,619 --> 01:50:13,340
It's just a punch.

786
01:50:14,140 --> 01:50:15,180
No, X on the swing.

787
01:50:15,180 --> 01:50:15,659
Oh, no.

788
01:50:15,659 --> 01:50:16,779
I'm not on a controller.

789
01:50:18,140 --> 01:50:18,699
You almost got him.

790
01:50:18,699 --> 01:50:19,180
You almost got him.

791
01:50:19,979 --> 01:50:22,619
Why is he hitting me?

792
01:50:24,619 --> 01:50:27,180
I'm just trying to find an opportunity when I should come in.

793
01:50:27,180 --> 01:50:28,060
I was going to let you fight the first enemy.

794
01:50:28,060 --> 01:50:29,500
I can't get a single hit on him.

795
01:50:33,430 --> 01:50:35,109
It's because I'm on a keyboard, I think.

796
01:50:35,109 --> 01:50:35,430
That's why.

797
01:50:35,430 --> 01:50:36,710
You probably need to plug a controller.

798
01:50:36,710 --> 01:50:37,109
Let me try.

799
01:50:37,109 --> 01:50:37,750
Let me try to hit him.

800
01:50:42,439 --> 01:50:44,520
Okay, so I don't know what was wrong with him, but my game was fine.

801
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:44,760
I mean...

802
01:50:48,859 --> 01:50:49,340
See?

803
01:50:49,340 --> 01:50:49,899
I'm ranged.

804
01:50:49,899 --> 01:50:50,300
I'm ranged.

805
01:50:50,300 --> 01:50:51,819
That's just what we were supposed to be doing.

806
01:50:51,819 --> 01:50:53,500
I mean, my game seems to be working fine.

807
01:50:54,380 --> 01:50:54,699
Yeah, yeah.

808
01:50:54,699 --> 01:50:55,180
No, no, no.

809
01:50:55,180 --> 01:50:55,899
It's just what we were...

810
01:50:55,899 --> 01:50:56,140
See?

811
01:50:56,140 --> 01:50:56,939
We did it together.

812
01:50:56,939 --> 01:50:59,979
Like, I just hit ranged attacks and that's how we were supposed to do it.

813
01:51:00,859 --> 01:51:03,500
Yeah, the guns probably are better.

814
01:51:05,189 --> 01:51:06,229
Yeah, yeah.

815
01:51:06,229 --> 01:51:06,949
That's what it was.

816
01:51:06,949 --> 01:51:07,829
That's what we were doing.

817
01:51:08,470 --> 01:51:12,069
We're probably going to have to fight a lot of those.

818
01:51:21,060 --> 01:51:22,979
Wait, that was just a regular creep?

819
01:51:22,979 --> 01:51:23,779
That wasn't the boss?

820
01:51:25,060 --> 01:51:25,859
I don't think so.

821
01:51:26,659 --> 01:51:27,060
Uh-oh.

822
01:51:27,779 --> 01:51:28,420
What, are you behind us?

823
01:51:29,380 --> 01:51:34,420
I look so much less intimidating next to you.

824
01:51:34,420 --> 01:51:35,939
Well, you have guns and I have a slingshot.

825
01:51:35,939 --> 01:51:37,699
Yeah, you have a slingshot, dude.

826
01:51:37,699 --> 01:51:38,260
What is that?

827
01:51:38,260 --> 01:51:39,539
Hey, watch this, you know?

828
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:43,079
All right, we got to get on the other side somehow.

829
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:45,510
Is there a way to go up?

830
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:54,920
Yeah.

831
01:51:55,720 --> 01:51:57,500
In parkour?

832
01:51:58,140 --> 01:51:59,699
Parkour.

833
01:52:02,329 --> 01:52:02,729
Nice.

834
01:52:03,289 --> 01:52:10,039
Okay, we should be able to...

835
01:52:11,399 --> 01:52:11,800
Very nice.

836
01:52:12,439 --> 01:52:20,840
All right, be careful.

837
01:52:22,649 --> 01:52:23,930
I'm never careful.

838
01:52:23,930 --> 01:52:26,010
Oh, also, you're playing keyboard and mouse, right?

839
01:52:26,649 --> 01:52:27,289
Yeah.

840
01:52:27,289 --> 01:52:29,529
In the lower left, you probably already know this,

841
01:52:29,529 --> 01:52:32,329
but there's a button to just do an instant, like 30% heal.

842
01:52:33,449 --> 01:52:34,329
Yeah, Z.

843
01:52:34,329 --> 01:52:34,810
Okay, yeah.

844
01:52:34,810 --> 01:52:35,449
Just want to make sure you...

845
01:52:36,090 --> 01:52:37,289
Oh, no, I've been abusing it.

846
01:52:37,289 --> 01:52:38,810
That's why I'm still alive, even though I...

847
01:52:39,770 --> 01:53:00,939
Are you going to play this again tomorrow?

848
01:53:00,939 --> 01:53:02,060
How many of you are there?

849
01:53:02,060 --> 01:53:03,260
I am not.

850
01:53:03,260 --> 01:53:04,619
I will not be playing this tomorrow.

851
01:53:04,619 --> 01:53:05,180
Oh, no.

852
01:53:05,180 --> 01:53:06,939
Who's going to carry me tomorrow, then?

853
01:53:06,939 --> 01:53:07,340
Oh, no.

854
01:53:08,859 --> 01:53:11,739
Bro, I can't even hit him.

855
01:53:11,739 --> 01:53:12,539
I'm not even kidding.

856
01:53:12,539 --> 01:53:13,659
I don't think I can hit him.

857
01:53:15,819 --> 01:53:17,579
I think I might be too low.

858
01:53:17,579 --> 01:53:19,020
Yeah, I'm doing like 22 damage.

859
01:53:19,020 --> 01:53:21,340
Yeah, try holding the heavy attack button.

860
01:53:23,350 --> 01:53:25,670
That should stun them, and then you can hit them.

861
01:53:25,670 --> 01:53:27,850
I wonder if they're combo...

862
01:53:27,850 --> 01:53:28,569
Are they combo moves?

863
01:53:29,289 --> 01:53:33,829
I want to see if I'm cool.

864
01:53:34,470 --> 01:53:35,859
Check this out.

865
01:53:43,420 --> 01:53:46,140
They're very good at dodging my projectiles.

866
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:47,819
Yeah, the best...

867
01:53:47,819 --> 01:53:49,100
These characters, you got to...

868
01:53:49,100 --> 01:53:50,380
You hold the heavy attack button.

869
01:53:50,380 --> 01:53:52,460
Whatever your range attack button is, hold it.

870
01:53:52,460 --> 01:53:53,260
Oh, God, I'm dead.

871
01:53:53,819 --> 01:53:54,859
I got you, don't worry.

872
01:53:54,859 --> 01:53:55,979
I'm respawning at two.

873
01:53:57,100 --> 01:53:57,420
One.

874
01:53:58,380 --> 01:53:59,659
I can't pick you up.

875
01:53:59,659 --> 01:53:59,899
Why?

876
01:53:59,899 --> 01:54:01,100
No, I have to do it myself.

877
01:54:05,430 --> 01:54:06,149
Wait, what?

878
01:54:06,149 --> 01:54:06,789
Where does I...

879
01:54:06,789 --> 01:54:07,670
Where do I respawn?

880
01:54:07,670 --> 01:54:07,989
Okay.

881
01:54:08,710 --> 01:54:19,180
Come on, we can't lose to the putties.

882
01:54:24,539 --> 01:54:25,420
Oh, I killed one.

883
01:54:25,420 --> 01:54:25,979
Nice job.

884
01:54:25,979 --> 01:54:26,380
Let's go.

885
01:54:27,020 --> 01:54:27,899
All right, so what's your...

886
01:54:27,899 --> 01:54:29,899
Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

887
01:54:35,130 --> 01:54:35,850
That's for me.

888
01:54:35,850 --> 01:54:36,250
All right, let's do...

889
01:54:36,250 --> 01:54:37,369
Can we do a pose?

890
01:54:37,369 --> 01:54:38,250
Let's do a pose together.

891
01:54:38,970 --> 01:54:41,449
On the count of three, let's do your favorite emote on the count of three

892
01:54:41,449 --> 01:54:42,170
because I want a picture.

893
01:54:43,130 --> 01:54:45,369
Okay, let's do it.

894
01:54:45,369 --> 01:54:46,090
I'm ready.

895
01:54:46,090 --> 01:54:47,529
One, two, three.

896
01:54:52,100 --> 01:54:53,060
That's fucking cool.

897
01:54:53,060 --> 01:54:53,859
Hold on, wait, wait, wait.

898
01:54:55,460 --> 01:54:57,739
I actually look so cool right now.

899
01:54:57,739 --> 01:54:58,859
You do look very cool.

900
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:04,020
I want a better frame.

901
01:55:04,420 --> 01:55:08,630
There we go.

902
01:55:08,630 --> 01:55:09,029
Perfect.

903
01:55:10,300 --> 01:55:10,539
Nice.

904
01:55:11,180 --> 01:55:11,659
Nice.

905
01:55:12,380 --> 01:55:14,489
All right, but what's your range attack button?

906
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:18,680
Right click and then left click

907
01:55:18,680 --> 01:55:22,659
or Q for range attacks or...

908
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:23,699
That one.

909
01:55:26,180 --> 01:55:27,779
Hold Q for heavy attack.

910
01:55:27,779 --> 01:55:29,060
So that one, you want to...

911
01:55:29,060 --> 01:55:30,659
That's the only way you can hurt these guys.

912
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:32,020
Oh, really?

913
01:55:32,020 --> 01:55:34,100
Yeah, so you have to hold it, hit somebody with it,

914
01:55:34,100 --> 01:55:36,420
and then they stunned enough for you to do the melee damage to them.

915
01:55:38,100 --> 01:55:38,899
Okay, got it.

916
01:55:39,539 --> 01:55:41,939
They are also level nine and I'm level three.

917
01:55:41,939 --> 01:55:42,979
That's also true.

918
01:55:42,979 --> 01:55:44,899
Yeah, you are kind of under levels for this.

919
01:55:44,899 --> 01:55:45,300
So am I.

920
01:55:46,100 --> 01:55:47,220
What am I, seven, six?

921
01:55:47,859 --> 01:55:52,920
People are yelling at me saying it was on my screen.

922
01:55:53,640 --> 01:55:57,590
Need my attention.

923
01:55:57,590 --> 01:56:01,260
All right, almost up there.

924
01:56:05,640 --> 01:56:07,319
These guys got nothing on us.

925
01:56:13,989 --> 01:56:15,590
That's actually not a bad impression.

926
01:56:15,590 --> 01:56:16,550
That actually sounds pretty good.

927
01:56:17,430 --> 01:56:20,260
All right, we're going to find research items.

928
01:56:20,899 --> 01:56:23,500
It's my job.

929
01:56:24,869 --> 01:56:27,029
Very good at finding research items.

930
01:56:27,829 --> 01:56:28,149
Sample.

931
01:56:28,789 --> 01:56:30,630
I think these are the research items.

932
01:56:31,270 --> 01:56:34,180
This is some giant slim gyms.

933
01:56:34,979 --> 01:56:38,180
This is a spectrographic analyzer.

934
01:56:38,180 --> 01:56:40,659
Spectrographic analyzer.

935
01:56:42,279 --> 01:56:43,319
I got a chest over here.

936
01:56:45,130 --> 01:56:46,729
I've never even seen a chest yet.

937
01:56:48,630 --> 01:56:49,350
Did you get the item?

938
01:56:49,350 --> 01:56:54,500
Ooh, I think I got some green stuff.

939
01:56:56,039 --> 01:56:57,560
Yeah, it's crafting material.

940
01:56:57,560 --> 01:57:01,720
So eventually you have enough to make new weapons and suits and stuff.

941
01:57:02,439 --> 01:57:05,800
Seems like we need to open up this extraction room.

942
01:57:05,800 --> 01:57:08,359
I think we have to find two more pieces of research.

943
01:57:09,079 --> 01:57:12,380
Which it looks like over here.

944
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:15,340
Oh, no, it's back here.

945
01:57:15,340 --> 01:57:16,539
What's this stuff?

946
01:57:17,979 --> 01:57:21,899
More x-ray analyzer and more ore samples.

947
01:57:21,899 --> 01:57:23,260
Is this going to be an insanely hard?

948
01:57:23,260 --> 01:57:24,539
This looks like a difficult puzzle.

949
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:29,560
Where'd you go?

950
01:57:29,560 --> 01:57:30,199
What are you doing?

951
01:57:30,199 --> 01:57:30,920
We opened it.

952
01:57:30,920 --> 01:57:31,800
That's it.

953
01:57:31,800 --> 01:57:32,760
Oh, it's down a level.

954
01:57:32,760 --> 01:57:35,079
There was a thing down there.

955
01:57:35,079 --> 01:57:38,390
It's a rock climbing wall.

956
01:57:38,390 --> 01:57:39,350
Oh, whoops.

957
01:57:43,609 --> 01:57:44,890
Rookie mistake.

958
01:57:44,890 --> 01:57:45,850
It's not a big deal.

959
01:57:47,670 --> 01:57:49,270
I'll keep us grounded.

960
01:57:49,909 --> 01:57:50,869
Oh, I fell.

961
01:57:52,229 --> 01:57:55,109
By grounded, I mean literally in the ground.

962
01:57:55,109 --> 01:57:56,069
Rookie mistake.

963
01:57:57,560 --> 01:57:57,960
What?

964
01:57:57,960 --> 01:57:59,399
I will do Red Hood now.

965
01:57:59,399 --> 01:58:00,520
Where are you off to?

966
01:58:01,560 --> 01:58:01,880
What?

967
01:58:02,600 --> 01:58:03,449
Oh, you're back.

968
01:58:04,250 --> 01:58:05,689
That was pretty sus.

969
01:58:09,350 --> 01:58:10,310
Oh, my God.

970
01:58:10,310 --> 01:58:11,189
I fell again.

971
01:58:16,250 --> 01:58:17,050
All right.

972
01:58:17,609 --> 01:58:18,090
You made it.

973
01:58:19,859 --> 01:58:20,579
You made it.

974
01:58:24,199 --> 01:58:26,439
I think the game got sick of you falling.

975
01:58:26,439 --> 01:58:27,079
Just put you there.

976
01:58:29,819 --> 01:58:32,380
Computer from a crown to all.

977
01:58:32,380 --> 01:58:35,819
I did some tinkering and went back to some older composite samples.

978
01:58:35,819 --> 01:58:39,819
Turns out what we thought was waste ore just needed a different extraction treatment.

979
01:58:39,819 --> 01:58:41,180
The carbonic acid.

980
01:58:41,180 --> 01:58:43,180
They're just making words up now.

981
01:58:43,180 --> 01:58:44,539
Carbonic acid.

982
01:58:44,539 --> 01:58:45,039
Carbonic.

983
01:58:46,060 --> 01:58:47,670
It's nerd stuff.

984
01:58:47,670 --> 01:58:48,630
Don't worry about it.

985
01:58:48,630 --> 01:58:50,390
Hey, I'm a nerd here.

986
01:58:50,390 --> 01:58:51,109
I've come on.

987
01:58:51,670 --> 01:58:52,920
All right.

988
01:58:52,920 --> 01:58:55,720
So this is samples have got to tell me something about what's going on.

989
01:58:55,720 --> 01:58:56,840
Oh, it's another piece together.

990
01:58:56,840 --> 01:58:57,399
The mystery.

991
01:58:59,750 --> 01:59:00,069
All right.

992
01:59:00,069 --> 01:59:01,109
I'll leave this up to you.

993
01:59:01,109 --> 01:59:02,710
The brains of the operation.

994
01:59:02,710 --> 01:59:04,949
Which sample should be placed in the extractor?

995
01:59:04,949 --> 01:59:07,750
Which chemical will extract material from the sample?

996
01:59:07,750 --> 01:59:08,229
Interesting.

997
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:15,159
Well, this is composite ore, which the holes in it would indicate that it's already been

998
01:59:15,159 --> 01:59:16,119
extracted.

999
01:59:16,119 --> 01:59:17,239
So I don't think it's this one.

1000
01:59:18,939 --> 01:59:19,899
Hmm.

1001
01:59:19,899 --> 01:59:24,439
A note on the sample reads reacts poorly to all previous extraction methods.

1002
01:59:24,439 --> 01:59:24,840
No sample.

1003
01:59:24,840 --> 01:59:28,899
I think it's marble 1063.

1004
01:59:28,899 --> 01:59:30,100
Um, what?

1005
01:59:30,100 --> 01:59:32,140
I don't know.

1006
01:59:32,140 --> 01:59:33,020
I just wanted to say.

1007
01:59:33,020 --> 01:59:34,460
Oh, you clicked on this one already.

1008
01:59:34,460 --> 01:59:37,430
All right.

1009
01:59:37,430 --> 01:59:39,270
So we need to actually figure this out.

1010
01:59:39,270 --> 01:59:41,350
So which sample should be placed in the extractor?

1011
01:59:41,350 --> 01:59:41,829
This one?

1012
01:59:41,829 --> 01:59:42,470
No.

1013
01:59:42,470 --> 01:59:43,350
It's already been used.

1014
01:59:44,409 --> 01:59:45,850
I hate science.

1015
01:59:48,779 --> 01:59:50,859
And can you back away Red Hood a little bit?

1016
01:59:50,859 --> 01:59:53,399
Your breath is fucking awful.

1017
01:59:53,399 --> 01:59:57,720
Listen, didn't have time to brush my teeth before we ran outside today.

1018
01:59:58,600 --> 01:59:59,720
No sample extracted.

1019
02:00:00,779 --> 02:00:02,380
Hasn't hasn't been extracted yet.

1020
02:00:02,939 --> 02:00:05,270
This one here.

1021
02:00:05,270 --> 02:00:07,829
Which chemical will extract material from the sample?

1022
02:00:09,770 --> 02:00:19,140
I didn't think you'd be able to smell my breath from under the mask.

1023
02:00:19,140 --> 02:00:32,500
How do I find out what the element is?

1024
02:00:33,619 --> 02:00:34,340
Which chemical?

1025
02:00:34,899 --> 02:00:39,130
Which chemical would it be?

1026
02:00:39,130 --> 02:00:44,619
How do I select it?

1027
02:00:44,619 --> 02:00:47,220
Okay.

1028
02:00:47,220 --> 02:00:49,779
If you can't figure it out, then there was no shot.

1029
02:00:49,779 --> 02:00:50,739
I was going to figure it out.

1030
02:00:50,739 --> 02:00:52,420
You're the nerd on this team.

1031
02:00:52,420 --> 02:00:53,460
Stop, stop, stop it.

1032
02:00:54,840 --> 02:00:58,220
Uh, where's the I'm trying to work Red Hood.

1033
02:00:59,369 --> 02:01:01,130
Which chemical will extract material from the sample?

1034
02:01:01,130 --> 02:01:02,569
Is that a mechanical keyboard?

1035
02:01:02,569 --> 02:01:03,770
Seems like a real gamer.

1036
02:01:03,770 --> 02:01:06,170
WASD keys are actually highlighted.

1037
02:01:06,170 --> 02:01:07,449
I wish Batgirl was here.

1038
02:01:07,449 --> 02:01:08,729
I wish Batgirl was here instead of you.

1039
02:01:11,430 --> 02:01:12,630
How can't I put any chemicals here?

1040
02:01:17,369 --> 02:01:18,489
Is there a list of the chemicals?

1041
02:01:18,489 --> 02:01:19,850
I don't see them anywhere.

1042
02:01:19,850 --> 02:01:20,890
I think that was a bit mean.

1043
02:01:21,689 --> 02:01:22,729
You just said right there.

1044
02:01:23,979 --> 02:01:28,329
I mean the breathing is fine, but you know how I feel about Batgirl.

1045
02:01:31,930 --> 02:01:33,289
Where's the list of chemicals?

1046
02:01:34,279 --> 02:01:35,640
Maybe the email?

1047
02:01:35,640 --> 02:01:38,279
Yeah, I can't click the email.

1048
02:01:38,279 --> 02:01:39,960
Sulfuric acid worked perfectly.

1049
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:41,159
So where's sulfuric acid?

1050
02:01:41,159 --> 02:01:42,680
Is sulfuric acid here somewhere?

1051
02:01:42,680 --> 02:01:43,560
Oh, Jesus.

1052
02:01:44,359 --> 02:01:46,489
It's all right, Red Hood.

1053
02:01:46,489 --> 02:01:46,970
I got this.

1054
02:01:47,770 --> 02:01:49,930
We just didn't look one inch to our left.

1055
02:01:50,649 --> 02:01:51,130
That's my bad.

1056
02:01:51,130 --> 02:01:51,850
I'm supposed to be the brains.

1057
02:01:53,130 --> 02:01:53,630
Yeah.

1058
02:01:54,649 --> 02:01:58,010
I apologize for everything I just said about telling you to get away from me and everything.

1059
02:01:58,010 --> 02:02:01,050
Are you loving this as much as I am?

1060
02:02:01,050 --> 02:02:02,970
No, I'm not.

1061
02:02:06,229 --> 02:02:06,630
I got it.

1062
02:02:06,630 --> 02:02:07,430
Okay, we're good.

1063
02:02:08,899 --> 02:02:10,979
I was just about to shoot this nerd thing.

1064
02:02:17,260 --> 02:02:18,619
That sounds made up.

1065
02:02:18,619 --> 02:02:22,520
I'm not the only one who hasn't heard of it.

1066
02:02:22,520 --> 02:02:25,449
We should get another photo.

1067
02:02:25,449 --> 02:02:26,729
Everyone wants me to say this.

1068
02:02:26,729 --> 02:02:27,689
I don't know why.

1069
02:02:27,689 --> 02:02:28,189
Scorn.

1070
02:02:29,270 --> 02:02:30,149
You shouldn't have said that.

1071
02:02:30,869 --> 02:02:31,369
Why?

1072
02:02:32,460 --> 02:02:34,460
Just saying you've infected your channel now.

1073
02:02:36,340 --> 02:02:36,899
Wait, what?

1074
02:02:36,899 --> 02:02:37,779
With what?

1075
02:02:37,779 --> 02:02:38,279
Scorn.

1076
02:02:39,380 --> 02:02:41,619
Guys, there's a new Scorn streamer here.

1077
02:02:42,500 --> 02:02:43,380
He's in the call right now.

1078
02:02:45,699 --> 02:02:46,819
I've never played that.

1079
02:02:48,359 --> 02:02:49,159
Well, now you have to.

1080
02:02:49,960 --> 02:02:55,239
I'm actually playing Gotham Knights.

1081
02:02:58,890 --> 02:03:04,170
A brand new open world third person or action RPG featuring the Batman family.

1082
02:03:04,170 --> 02:03:07,689
You can step into the roles of Batgirl, Nightwing, Red Hood, and Robin

1083
02:03:07,689 --> 02:03:11,770
and rise up as the new protectors of Gotham City in the wake of Batman's death.

1084
02:03:12,329 --> 02:03:15,930
You can also customize your night with new gear and looks as you play through all the

1085
02:03:15,930 --> 02:03:21,529
new original story solo or an online co-op with a friend like Jerma.

1086
02:03:21,529 --> 02:03:22,250
Like we're doing right now.

1087
02:03:22,810 --> 02:03:26,569
Like we're doing right now and come face to face with some of the most infamous

1088
02:03:26,569 --> 02:03:31,529
villains in DC's Batman universe such as Mr. Freeze, Harley Quinn,

1089
02:03:31,529 --> 02:03:34,890
Spoiler Alert, Clayface, and Mysterious Court of Owls.

1090
02:03:35,449 --> 02:03:39,770
Gotham Knights is now available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S, X, and the PC.

1091
02:03:40,489 --> 02:03:43,210
It really looks like your character is sitting there talking into a camera.

1092
02:03:45,319 --> 02:03:45,800
Yeah.

1093
02:03:45,800 --> 02:03:46,279
Right there.

1094
02:03:46,279 --> 02:03:47,159
Because he is.

1095
02:03:48,119 --> 02:03:51,189
But everything you just said was true.

1096
02:03:51,750 --> 02:03:52,630
Is there a co-op experience?

1097
02:03:52,630 --> 02:03:54,949
Batman is dead and also he's Bruce Wayne.

1098
02:03:57,079 --> 02:04:00,520
Uh, there's an absolutely amazing part.

1099
02:04:00,520 --> 02:04:03,479
I don't know if you'll see it or whatever, but I forget how far into it it is.

1100
02:04:03,479 --> 02:04:04,199
It's absolutely hilarious.

1101
02:04:04,199 --> 02:04:05,560
It's probably the best part of the entire game.

1102
02:04:06,439 --> 02:04:08,600
So, um, Batman sends an email.

1103
02:04:09,319 --> 02:04:11,319
This is a spoiler, by the way, but it's hilarious.

1104
02:04:11,319 --> 02:04:14,279
So Batman sends an email out to like all the Gotham Knights.

1105
02:04:14,840 --> 02:04:17,560
He's like, oh, hey, I just want to make sure everyone's aware of this.

1106
02:04:17,560 --> 02:04:23,079
Um, it seems to me that Bruce Wayne and Batman are Google trending right now.

1107
02:04:23,079 --> 02:04:25,000
So I feel like people know who I am.

1108
02:04:25,560 --> 02:04:29,960
He actually says that search trending like he's trending as Bruce Wayne and Batman.

1109
02:04:30,760 --> 02:04:31,800
He's a bit of a boomer.

1110
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,880
Yeah, but that was like my favorite part of the entire game so far.

1111
02:04:35,880 --> 02:04:38,119
There's nothing wrong with being a boomer.

1112
02:04:38,119 --> 02:04:39,479
All right, let's go.

1113
02:04:39,479 --> 02:04:44,279
He looks up his name and Batman and sees that like the trend line for searches has gone up.

1114
02:04:44,279 --> 02:04:46,680
So he's like, oh shit, I've been compromised.

1115
02:04:46,680 --> 02:04:47,399
That's how he knows.

1116
02:04:49,619 --> 02:04:50,819
Suggesting that the ho.

1117
02:05:04,680 --> 02:05:06,840
There is everything wrong with being a boomer.

1118
02:05:07,930 --> 02:05:08,649
Wait, what do you mean?

1119
02:05:08,649 --> 02:05:09,449
Oh, are you saying that?

1120
02:05:09,449 --> 02:05:11,689
Wow, they're being ages.

1121
02:05:11,689 --> 02:05:12,489
They're being ages.

1122
02:05:15,590 --> 02:05:22,899
Oh, it's clear you don't understand your place.

1123
02:05:25,369 --> 02:05:30,329
Dog, you're a dude in an owl head.

1124
02:05:32,600 --> 02:05:34,520
We are the protectors, not you.

1125
02:05:34,520 --> 02:05:34,680
What?

1126
02:05:37,720 --> 02:05:38,680
Well, that's a load of shit.

1127
02:05:39,640 --> 02:05:49,260
Don't you think you'd want to press that when you leave?

1128
02:05:51,539 --> 02:05:54,180
Yeah, doesn't that hurt his own owl guys?

1129
02:05:54,180 --> 02:05:57,319
Yeah, and I think I want to be in the cut scene.

1130
02:05:57,319 --> 02:05:58,359
I'm not in the cut scene.

1131
02:05:59,399 --> 02:06:01,670
I pressed it.

1132
02:06:01,670 --> 02:06:03,909
So we're going to get the fuck out of here now.

1133
02:06:03,909 --> 02:06:04,390
Are you ready?

1134
02:06:05,659 --> 02:06:06,939
Yeah, I'm going to do the cute thing now.

1135
02:06:07,659 --> 02:06:15,590
All right, we got to do superhero talking to each other like in every movie.

1136
02:06:16,819 --> 02:06:19,460
Okay, I'm not able to use the ocean.

1137
02:06:19,460 --> 02:06:19,859
Oh, God.

1138
02:06:19,859 --> 02:06:20,739
Red Hood 6 o'clock.

1139
02:06:22,840 --> 02:06:23,399
Bullseye.

1140
02:06:24,279 --> 02:06:27,720
Oh, that was mine, man.

1141
02:06:27,720 --> 02:06:28,279
I died.

1142
02:06:28,840 --> 02:06:34,840
I can't help you up.

1143
02:06:34,840 --> 02:06:36,039
Wait, I can respawn.

1144
02:06:36,039 --> 02:06:38,680
I don't know why it just it wouldn't let me know.

1145
02:06:39,399 --> 02:06:40,119
Oh, I'm good.

1146
02:06:40,119 --> 02:06:40,840
I'm good again.

1147
02:06:40,840 --> 02:06:41,479
I respawn.

1148
02:06:42,600 --> 02:06:43,319
Oh, God.

1149
02:06:43,319 --> 02:06:44,840
Okay, they're spawn camping.

1150
02:06:45,560 --> 02:06:51,880
Oh, my God.

1151
02:06:51,880 --> 02:06:53,000
These guys are kind of tough, actually.

1152
02:06:53,560 --> 02:06:55,289
Oh, God.

1153
02:06:55,289 --> 02:06:55,770
I'm going to fall.

1154
02:06:56,489 --> 02:07:00,300
There's a button prompt and I don't know what button it is.

1155
02:07:00,300 --> 02:07:02,220
It just flashes way too quickly.

1156
02:07:03,100 --> 02:07:03,579
It's dodge.

1157
02:07:04,220 --> 02:07:07,420
So you see like when their hands kind of light up with a circle around it.

1158
02:07:07,420 --> 02:07:09,899
When the circle lights up, that means you can do a perfect evade.

1159
02:07:10,300 --> 02:07:11,500
I don't think you can put a point in it.

1160
02:07:11,500 --> 02:07:24,699
No, it's not it.

1161
02:07:24,699 --> 02:07:25,260
Here we go.

1162
02:07:25,899 --> 02:07:28,779
Okay, I have to actually right click because it doesn't auto aim.

1163
02:07:29,500 --> 02:07:31,260
Possibly because of the PC.

1164
02:07:31,260 --> 02:07:31,739
Probably.

1165
02:07:31,739 --> 02:07:32,619
What was that?

1166
02:07:32,619 --> 02:07:33,020
What is that?

1167
02:07:33,020 --> 02:07:34,220
The Ghost of Nightwing?

1168
02:07:34,220 --> 02:07:34,779
What the hell?

1169
02:07:40,039 --> 02:07:40,439
What do you got?

1170
02:07:40,439 --> 02:07:41,560
A spirit bomb?

1171
02:07:41,560 --> 02:07:42,199
What is that?

1172
02:07:42,199 --> 02:07:43,880
The Ghost of Nightwing.

1173
02:07:47,100 --> 02:07:47,659
Nice job.

1174
02:07:47,659 --> 02:07:48,859
Oh, you killed him.

1175
02:07:48,859 --> 02:07:50,140
I killed him, actually.

1176
02:07:50,140 --> 02:07:50,699
That was me.

1177
02:07:50,699 --> 02:07:56,779
Oh, we're going down, man.

1178
02:07:56,779 --> 02:07:57,420
We're going down.

1179
02:08:00,949 --> 02:08:02,069
We're going down, Goku.

1180
02:08:03,899 --> 02:08:06,060
Well, I guess they're going down with us.

1181
02:08:07,020 --> 02:08:12,619
No, we're good.

1182
02:08:21,350 --> 02:08:22,710
Not in the cutscene, Sag.

1183
02:08:23,590 --> 02:08:29,609
I think I'm just about done with Talons, thank you.

1184
02:08:32,460 --> 02:08:33,659
The mines are collapsing.

1185
02:08:33,659 --> 02:08:34,460
Oh, it is collapsing.

1186
02:08:37,579 --> 02:08:40,140
This is not what I was expecting to be for our Saturday afternoon.

1187
02:08:41,100 --> 02:08:41,899
Are we running?

1188
02:08:41,899 --> 02:08:42,460
I'm running.

1189
02:08:43,500 --> 02:08:44,460
I'm not fighting.

1190
02:08:44,460 --> 02:08:45,180
I'm running.

1191
02:08:46,539 --> 02:08:49,180
Hey, when we get back, promise me you'll do the cooking.

1192
02:08:50,439 --> 02:08:52,439
Is that you talking or is that Robin?

1193
02:08:52,439 --> 02:08:52,680
What?

1194
02:08:54,550 --> 02:08:57,590
I've been saying hi to the chat for a minute or two.

1195
02:08:58,229 --> 02:09:01,430
Wait, it just says, when we get back, promise you'll do the cooking.

1196
02:09:02,649 --> 02:09:05,020
I was muted.

1197
02:09:05,819 --> 02:09:11,500
Wait, is that actually him?

1198
02:09:13,750 --> 02:09:13,989
Yeah.

1199
02:09:14,789 --> 02:09:21,819
Am I being ghastly right now?

1200
02:09:21,819 --> 02:09:23,180
That is pretty sus of you, dude.

1201
02:09:23,899 --> 02:09:26,460
Yeah, I was being kind of sus.

1202
02:09:27,500 --> 02:09:28,779
Damn, you were sussy.

1203
02:09:32,659 --> 02:09:34,180
Wait, can you do that again for real?

1204
02:09:35,989 --> 02:09:37,590
Uh, it has to be in the moment.

1205
02:09:37,590 --> 02:09:38,390
I'm a method actor.

1206
02:09:44,899 --> 02:09:46,020
I hate cave-ins.

1207
02:09:46,819 --> 02:09:52,260
Guess we got to go up now.

1208
02:09:53,939 --> 02:09:54,340
Okay.

1209
02:09:55,140 --> 02:09:57,479
That was a bad line, I'm sorry.

1210
02:09:59,640 --> 02:10:00,680
And I didn't even do it.

1211
02:10:00,680 --> 02:10:01,079
Okay.

1212
02:10:02,119 --> 02:10:03,319
Okay, okay.

1213
02:10:04,359 --> 02:10:07,500
All right, let's switch roles now.

1214
02:10:07,500 --> 02:10:09,020
You do Robin and I'll do Red Hood.

1215
02:10:09,420 --> 02:10:10,539
I can't do Robin.

1216
02:10:12,680 --> 02:10:15,979
I think I can probably do a pretty good Red Hood.

1217
02:10:15,979 --> 02:10:17,500
I sure hope so.

1218
02:10:17,500 --> 02:10:20,460
Okay, that sounds very scorn-like.

1219
02:10:21,500 --> 02:10:22,220
Maybe a little.

1220
02:10:25,609 --> 02:10:26,810
Why do you sound hungry?

1221
02:10:29,050 --> 02:10:31,909
Oh, up here.

1222
02:10:31,909 --> 02:10:32,630
I'm up here.

1223
02:10:32,630 --> 02:10:35,270
I'm looking forward to chopping those carrots later on.

1224
02:10:35,270 --> 02:10:36,550
It's a long ride up.

1225
02:10:38,409 --> 02:10:40,329
Shut up, Robin, you fucking idiot.

1226
02:10:43,939 --> 02:10:46,979
Listen, Red Hood, just because you're so sexy and muscular

1227
02:10:46,979 --> 02:10:49,960
doesn't mean you can bully me like that.

1228
02:10:50,760 --> 02:10:51,560
Oh, well, I have to see.

1229
02:10:51,560 --> 02:10:53,079
But I like it.

1230
02:10:53,079 --> 02:10:55,079
We did a really good job together.

1231
02:10:56,119 --> 02:10:56,680
You and I.

1232
02:10:56,680 --> 02:10:59,880
You sound a lot like that conspiracy guy, Alex Jones.

1233
02:10:59,880 --> 02:11:00,920
I just want to tell you, look,

1234
02:11:01,720 --> 02:11:02,920
what you need to understand,

1235
02:11:02,920 --> 02:11:05,079
it's not, I'm not, it's not, don't listen to me.

1236
02:11:05,079 --> 02:11:08,949
Belfry, can you hear me?

1237
02:11:08,949 --> 02:11:11,590
When we get back, when we get back to the Belfry,

1238
02:11:11,590 --> 02:11:13,510
I'm going to eat as much meat as I can.

1239
02:11:13,510 --> 02:11:15,829
I'm going to eat, and I'm going to have children.

1240
02:11:15,829 --> 02:11:18,550
The court is mining the strange element I've never heard of.

1241
02:11:18,630 --> 02:11:20,310
Here we are, we have you.

1242
02:11:23,979 --> 02:11:24,779
Are you still there?

1243
02:11:25,739 --> 02:11:26,619
Belfry.

1244
02:11:26,619 --> 02:11:27,899
Oh, no, where's Belfry?

1245
02:11:29,739 --> 02:11:30,460
How are we going to go back?

1246
02:11:35,020 --> 02:11:37,020
Whatever you do, do not punch this person.

1247
02:11:37,020 --> 02:11:37,579
Don't do it.

1248
02:11:37,579 --> 02:11:39,100
I'm telling you right now, you better not.

1249
02:11:39,899 --> 02:11:40,399
Where?

1250
02:11:42,020 --> 02:11:43,060
This guy?

1251
02:11:43,060 --> 02:11:44,100
You better not.

1252
02:11:44,100 --> 02:11:44,579
Don't do it.

1253
02:11:45,380 --> 02:11:46,100
You're under arrest.

1254
02:11:46,739 --> 02:11:48,500
All right, stop.

1255
02:11:48,500 --> 02:11:49,939
Actually, stop it.

1256
02:11:49,939 --> 02:11:50,899
Stop it.

1257
02:11:50,899 --> 02:11:51,300
Stop.

1258
02:11:51,300 --> 02:11:52,340
I'm getting out of here.

1259
02:11:52,340 --> 02:11:52,979
I'm getting out of here.

1260
02:11:52,979 --> 02:11:53,939
This is not on my stream.

1261
02:11:53,939 --> 02:11:54,420
I'm out of here.

1262
02:11:55,460 --> 02:11:57,380
I thought you told me to punch the person.

1263
02:11:58,020 --> 02:11:58,739
I said, don't.

1264
02:12:01,979 --> 02:12:03,100
I misunderstood.

1265
02:12:05,670 --> 02:12:07,590
You tell me to punch, I say, how hard?

1266
02:12:08,229 --> 02:12:13,180
All right, we're going to go talk to Talia Al Ghul.

1267
02:12:13,899 --> 02:12:18,229
I'm a bit of a anti-hero.

1268
02:12:18,229 --> 02:12:18,550
You know what?

1269
02:12:18,550 --> 02:12:21,579
Let's do, oh, my game's just turned off.

1270
02:12:21,579 --> 02:12:27,210
Oops.

1271
02:12:27,210 --> 02:12:27,449
What?

1272
02:12:27,449 --> 02:12:30,149
Are we still on the call?

1273
02:12:30,149 --> 02:12:30,649
Yeah.

1274
02:12:32,310 --> 02:12:32,869
What?

1275
02:12:32,869 --> 02:12:33,670
I'm going up.

1276
02:12:34,390 --> 02:12:35,829
I think I'm going to have to join you.

1277
02:12:35,829 --> 02:12:38,409
Wait, are you still in my game?

1278
02:12:38,409 --> 02:12:41,659
Wait, I just lost.

1279
02:12:41,739 --> 02:12:44,409
Connection to the game session.

1280
02:12:44,409 --> 02:12:48,649
Yeah, I think it just booted us, I think.

1281
02:12:48,649 --> 02:12:49,609
Wait, why did that happen?

1282
02:12:52,569 --> 02:12:52,970
Internet.

1283
02:12:52,970 --> 02:12:56,409
OK, well, on that note, I think, I mean, wait, hold on.

1284
02:12:57,979 --> 02:12:59,100
When did you start playing?

1285
02:13:01,819 --> 02:13:02,859
I don't know, like a couple hours ago.

1286
02:13:03,420 --> 02:13:03,899
Oh, OK.

1287
02:13:04,939 --> 02:13:05,819
Do you want to keep going?

1288
02:13:05,819 --> 02:13:11,159
Because I was just going to end it here.

1289
02:13:11,159 --> 02:13:12,789
Oh, OK.

1290
02:13:12,789 --> 02:13:17,590
Yeah, I'm going to play for like another 20 minutes, 30 minutes.

1291
02:13:18,149 --> 02:13:21,109
If you want, I'll play more with you.

1292
02:13:21,109 --> 02:13:23,670
Do you want to keep playing?

1293
02:13:23,670 --> 02:13:25,510
Yeah, I'll play 20 more minutes.

1294
02:13:25,510 --> 02:13:28,550
Let's do at least a couple of crimes on the street.

1295
02:13:28,550 --> 02:13:32,010
Wait, I wonder if it's because I shot the civilians.

1296
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:32,729
No.

1297
02:13:32,729 --> 02:13:38,699
Let's do a little bit more.

1298
02:13:38,699 --> 02:13:39,819
You come with me this time.

1299
02:13:39,819 --> 02:13:40,859
You come with me on a mission.

1300
02:13:40,859 --> 02:13:43,260
All right, yeah, that's probably better because then I can actually carry

1301
02:13:43,260 --> 02:13:47,689
because I'm going to be like four or five levels higher than you.

1302
02:13:47,689 --> 02:13:48,010
OK.

1303
02:13:48,649 --> 02:13:49,689
So let me go to social.

1304
02:13:50,250 --> 02:13:52,010
Wait, why isn't it showing up on recent?

1305
02:13:52,010 --> 02:13:52,489
Oh.

1306
02:13:52,489 --> 02:13:52,970
Friends.

1307
02:13:53,960 --> 02:13:55,319
In-game friends, it doesn't say.

1308
02:13:55,319 --> 02:13:57,050
Are you offline?

1309
02:13:57,050 --> 02:13:57,550
No.

1310
02:13:58,340 --> 02:13:58,739
Hold on.

1311
02:13:58,739 --> 02:14:02,949
I'm just are you offline?

1312
02:14:02,949 --> 02:14:05,800
No.

1313
02:14:05,800 --> 02:14:06,520
Can you invite me?

1314
02:14:06,520 --> 02:14:09,800
You're not you're not showing up on my list.

1315
02:14:12,619 --> 02:14:15,899
Oh, no, it says, OK, invite player.

1316
02:14:15,899 --> 02:14:18,229
Oh, there you go.

1317
02:14:18,229 --> 02:14:20,310
Invite casket to your game.

1318
02:14:20,310 --> 02:14:20,869
Let's go.

1319
02:14:21,430 --> 02:14:22,390
Did it work?

1320
02:14:22,390 --> 02:14:23,850
Can you hear me?

1321
02:14:25,260 --> 02:14:26,220
I mean, I invited you.

1322
02:14:27,020 --> 02:14:28,060
I wonder if it was it through.

1323
02:14:28,060 --> 02:14:28,539
Oh, it's through.

1324
02:14:28,539 --> 02:14:30,359
OK, it was through steam.

1325
02:14:30,359 --> 02:14:30,760
I see.

1326
02:14:30,760 --> 02:14:31,880
Yeah, it's through steam friends.

1327
02:14:32,439 --> 02:14:33,399
OK, coming in.

1328
02:14:33,399 --> 02:14:41,619
So let's play for like another 25, 30 minutes or so, 20 minutes.

1329
02:14:41,619 --> 02:14:46,630
I mean, you know, Warner Brothers is obviously sponsoring the stream.

1330
02:14:46,630 --> 02:14:48,229
So let's showcase what we can.

1331
02:14:48,229 --> 02:14:49,579
You know what I'm saying?

1332
02:14:49,579 --> 02:14:51,020
Hey, there you are.

1333
02:14:51,020 --> 02:14:53,420
God, you look like such a freaking nerd.

1334
02:14:59,899 --> 02:15:00,460
Little guy.

1335
02:15:02,520 --> 02:15:04,119
Wait, can you change your casual gear?

1336
02:15:04,680 --> 02:15:06,199
I don't think you can change the casual gear.

1337
02:15:09,880 --> 02:15:11,319
So this is your game.

1338
02:15:11,319 --> 02:15:12,439
So am I still level?

1339
02:15:13,079 --> 02:15:15,819
I'm still level eight.

1340
02:15:15,819 --> 02:15:16,460
So.

1341
02:15:16,460 --> 02:15:23,560
Oh, my God, the talent gear is soon.

1342
02:15:23,560 --> 02:15:25,239
Wait, I have different demon.

1343
02:15:25,239 --> 02:15:26,439
I have different ones here.

1344
02:15:27,239 --> 02:15:27,479
Yeah.

1345
02:15:27,479 --> 02:15:28,119
No, I don't.

1346
02:15:28,119 --> 02:15:28,760
Shinobi.

1347
02:15:28,760 --> 02:15:29,239
No, no, no.

1348
02:15:29,239 --> 02:15:30,119
It's the same ones.

1349
02:15:30,119 --> 02:15:32,359
As you level up, you unlock more suits and stuff.

1350
02:15:32,359 --> 02:15:38,619
Well, how do I get to this one?

1351
02:15:38,619 --> 02:15:39,579
I actually like that.

1352
02:15:39,579 --> 02:15:41,659
When I do the decoy, the elemental residue.

1353
02:15:41,659 --> 02:15:42,619
That's pretty cool to me.

1354
02:15:43,260 --> 02:15:48,149
I'm going to take a look at the workbench here.

1355
02:15:49,699 --> 02:15:50,020
You should.

1356
02:15:50,020 --> 02:15:51,220
I don't have a suit.

1357
02:15:52,710 --> 02:15:54,229
I don't have anything for suit.

1358
02:15:54,229 --> 02:15:56,069
I only have stuff for melee.

1359
02:15:56,789 --> 02:16:02,789
Like I can craft a stealth pistol and I'm doing all that,

1360
02:16:02,789 --> 02:16:05,670
but I want to do it so I can like actually change my suit.

1361
02:16:05,670 --> 02:16:06,630
But I can't.

1362
02:16:06,630 --> 02:16:08,470
It only says apply transmog.

1363
02:16:08,470 --> 02:16:10,789
Does that mean it's unlockable?

1364
02:16:12,039 --> 02:16:12,439
All right.

1365
02:16:12,439 --> 02:16:16,039
So does it say crafting ready underneath it?

1366
02:16:16,039 --> 02:16:16,760
Oh, no.

1367
02:16:16,760 --> 02:16:18,680
So you don't have enough materials.

1368
02:16:18,680 --> 02:16:23,699
Joe, why are you guys saying you have other gear to equip?

1369
02:16:24,340 --> 02:16:30,260
If you get out of this and just go hold down whatever to get to that menu.

1370
02:16:30,260 --> 02:16:35,459
Like one and go to gear just like out of the workbench and then go to suit

1371
02:16:36,280 --> 02:16:37,319
and then go to melee.

1372
02:16:37,719 --> 02:16:39,879
It's the same thing, but you probably have a couple things to switch out.

1373
02:16:43,780 --> 02:16:44,579
Okay, suit.

1374
02:16:45,219 --> 02:16:46,659
I have the beyond suit on.

1375
02:16:48,540 --> 02:16:49,899
You might have other guns too.

1376
02:16:54,059 --> 02:16:54,620
Last hurrah.

1377
02:16:54,620 --> 02:16:56,459
Yeah, I'll do nightwing last hurrah.

1378
02:16:56,459 --> 02:16:58,840
It's my favorite character.

1379
02:16:58,840 --> 02:17:02,500
I want to play more bad girl though.

1380
02:17:02,500 --> 02:17:03,139
Bad girl is cool.

1381
02:17:06,950 --> 02:17:09,510
Oh, your stats are being decreased to match the hose.

1382
02:17:09,510 --> 02:17:10,629
They are.

1383
02:17:10,629 --> 02:17:11,350
Oh, shit.

1384
02:17:11,350 --> 02:17:11,670
Okay.

1385
02:17:12,389 --> 02:17:14,549
Well, I mean, that makes sense.

1386
02:17:14,549 --> 02:17:17,639
But yeah, that makes sense.

1387
02:17:18,600 --> 02:17:20,600
Okay, I have a stock suit and a beyond suit.

1388
02:17:20,600 --> 02:17:23,319
That's it on gear.

1389
02:17:23,319 --> 02:17:24,920
That's the only two things I have.

1390
02:17:25,559 --> 02:17:28,940
And I guess I can try this.

1391
02:17:28,940 --> 02:17:30,139
Yeah, with different styles.

1392
02:17:30,700 --> 02:17:33,850
I've been waiting to do this ability.

1393
02:17:33,850 --> 02:17:34,649
This is gonna be awesome.

1394
02:17:45,530 --> 02:17:46,090
Hold on.

1395
02:17:47,479 --> 02:17:50,440
Okay, Batman's last case, weird science.

1396
02:17:50,440 --> 02:17:51,239
Should we do that one?

1397
02:17:51,239 --> 02:17:52,840
Is that what you want to do?

1398
02:17:52,840 --> 02:17:54,280
Yeah, or we could even just walk around the city

1399
02:17:54,280 --> 02:17:56,760
and just do like the kind of random events.

1400
02:17:57,399 --> 02:18:00,500
I feel like that would take about 20 minutes or so,

1401
02:18:00,500 --> 02:18:01,860
not like 30, 40 minutes.

1402
02:18:03,299 --> 02:18:03,799
Okay.

1403
02:18:04,979 --> 02:18:06,100
Wait, hold on.

1404
02:18:06,100 --> 02:18:06,600
Melee.

1405
02:18:07,690 --> 02:18:10,489
We might actually have to be out for you to put new stuff on.

1406
02:18:10,489 --> 02:18:13,620
I wonder if I can craft something.

1407
02:18:20,200 --> 02:18:21,639
I cannot.

1408
02:18:21,639 --> 02:18:25,719
I guess I can't.

1409
02:18:31,959 --> 02:18:36,120
Oh, I have the beyond suit now.

1410
02:18:36,120 --> 02:18:38,120
I think you were in that before, were you?

1411
02:18:38,920 --> 02:18:41,319
Yeah, but it just like it changed it.

1412
02:18:44,760 --> 02:18:47,159
Oh, styles.

1413
02:18:51,020 --> 02:18:54,700
I can do new guard on the beyond suit.

1414
02:18:54,700 --> 02:18:55,340
That's it.

1415
02:18:58,149 --> 02:18:59,909
I can do night watch.

1416
02:18:59,909 --> 02:19:01,110
I mean, I like night watch.

1417
02:19:01,110 --> 02:19:02,379
It's fine.

1418
02:19:02,379 --> 02:19:04,059
I want shinobi, but it won't let me.

1419
02:19:04,059 --> 02:19:05,100
And night ops, I can't.

1420
02:19:09,770 --> 02:19:12,809
Metal is sick, privateer, demon, neon, nor.

1421
02:19:13,930 --> 02:19:17,049
Batgirl, he's talking to himself again.

1422
02:19:17,049 --> 02:19:20,180
No, I'm talking to you as well, but...

1423
02:19:20,739 --> 02:19:23,350
Batgirl, I don't mean...

1424
02:19:23,989 --> 02:19:29,850
Who is he talking to?

1425
02:19:30,729 --> 02:19:31,850
I'm just talking to you.

1426
02:19:31,850 --> 02:19:33,129
Do people say that in your chat?

1427
02:19:34,469 --> 02:19:35,190
All the time.

1428
02:19:35,190 --> 02:19:37,510
After you go on, like you talk for like 10 straight minutes,

1429
02:19:37,510 --> 02:19:39,430
people just go like, who is he talking to?

1430
02:19:39,430 --> 02:19:40,229
Who are you talking to?

1431
02:19:47,510 --> 02:19:50,489
All right, let's try to do a crime.

1432
02:19:50,489 --> 02:19:52,600
You know what I mean?

1433
02:19:52,600 --> 02:19:53,399
Shopping again.

1434
02:19:53,399 --> 02:19:54,200
That's what he's doing.

1435
02:19:54,200 --> 02:19:54,680
That's true.

1436
02:19:54,680 --> 02:19:55,799
I am shopping.

1437
02:19:55,799 --> 02:19:57,719
I do be shopping a lot.

1438
02:19:57,719 --> 02:20:03,479
Did you say let's do a crime?

1439
02:20:03,479 --> 02:20:05,000
I meant, yeah, you know what I mean?

1440
02:20:05,639 --> 02:20:07,719
You meant let's stop a crime.

1441
02:20:07,719 --> 02:20:09,159
Okay, Batman's last case.

1442
02:20:12,280 --> 02:20:13,000
You don't want to do that.

1443
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:14,680
You want to do just regular, huh?

1444
02:20:14,680 --> 02:20:16,280
Um, I'm down for it.

1445
02:20:16,280 --> 02:20:17,399
I think it'd probably be easier.

1446
02:20:17,399 --> 02:20:19,319
It'd be less time if we did just the stuff on the street.

1447
02:20:20,180 --> 02:20:22,420
Okay, you lead the way then.

1448
02:20:22,420 --> 02:20:23,940
Or do I have to lead the way?

1449
02:20:23,940 --> 02:20:25,059
I think because you're the host,

1450
02:20:25,059 --> 02:20:26,020
I think you might have to lead the way.

1451
02:20:27,049 --> 02:20:29,209
Okay, there's a difficulty low.

1452
02:20:29,209 --> 02:20:31,049
Let's do a higher difficulty one.

1453
02:20:31,049 --> 02:20:31,930
There's only one.

1454
02:20:31,930 --> 02:20:33,290
There's only two crimes here.

1455
02:20:33,290 --> 02:20:34,170
Difficulty normal.

1456
02:20:34,889 --> 02:20:35,690
Faction mob.

1457
02:20:36,569 --> 02:20:38,649
Yeah, I like awesome.

1458
02:20:38,649 --> 02:20:41,610
And then there's another low difficulty kidnapping and process.

1459
02:20:44,120 --> 02:20:46,040
Okay, that's 473 meters.

1460
02:20:46,040 --> 02:20:48,120
Maybe we should take our...

1461
02:20:48,120 --> 02:20:48,760
Is that that way?

1462
02:20:49,639 --> 02:21:06,489
All right.

1463
02:21:06,489 --> 02:21:14,250
Okay, never mind.

1464
02:21:14,250 --> 02:21:17,049
This was a very easy way to traverse long distances.

1465
02:21:17,770 --> 02:21:20,180
There's a shootout happening downstairs.

1466
02:21:22,540 --> 02:21:23,979
I think we should cover it.

1467
02:21:23,979 --> 02:21:24,479
Coming.

1468
02:21:25,100 --> 02:21:33,180
All right, so where's it at?

1469
02:21:33,180 --> 02:21:33,680
Right here?

1470
02:21:34,299 --> 02:21:34,940
Underneath us?

1471
02:21:35,579 --> 02:21:36,379
Yeah, it's down here.

1472
02:21:36,379 --> 02:21:38,299
I'm going to engage in an aerial attack.

1473
02:21:38,299 --> 02:21:38,860
Let's go for it.

1474
02:21:40,420 --> 02:21:41,059
Wait, what?

1475
02:21:41,059 --> 02:21:42,100
Oh, these are cops.

1476
02:21:43,270 --> 02:21:43,909
What?

1477
02:21:43,909 --> 02:21:45,899
I'm beating up cops.

1478
02:21:45,899 --> 02:21:46,540
I don't know why.

1479
02:21:46,540 --> 02:21:46,940
Wait, wait, wait.

1480
02:21:46,940 --> 02:21:47,500
What happened?

1481
02:21:47,500 --> 02:21:49,260
Wait, this is not the robbery.

1482
02:21:49,260 --> 02:21:49,979
This is a robbery?

1483
02:21:52,139 --> 02:21:53,340
Why are we beating up cops?

1484
02:21:53,340 --> 02:21:54,059
I don't know.

1485
02:21:54,059 --> 02:21:55,180
You came down here.

1486
02:21:56,219 --> 02:21:57,100
What's the mission?

1487
02:21:57,100 --> 02:21:58,379
They're so strong.

1488
02:21:59,100 --> 02:21:59,500
Hold on.

1489
02:22:00,700 --> 02:22:01,739
They have stuff over here.

1490
02:22:04,379 --> 02:22:05,420
I'm shooting the wrong thing.

1491
02:22:06,700 --> 02:22:16,040
Dude, I have ice moves.

1492
02:22:16,680 --> 02:22:25,639
Why are we doing this?

1493
02:22:25,639 --> 02:22:26,120
I don't know.

1494
02:22:26,840 --> 02:22:28,100
Just go with it, I guess.

1495
02:22:35,110 --> 02:22:37,430
It's the next street over, Hassan.

1496
02:22:38,069 --> 02:22:40,540
Oh, God.

1497
02:22:46,309 --> 02:22:47,270
Oh, you killed him.

1498
02:22:48,229 --> 02:22:50,809
All right, it's the next street over.

1499
02:22:51,450 --> 02:22:52,969
I think we helped the cops out.

1500
02:22:52,969 --> 02:22:54,969
I mean, I think we helped the crimers out.

1501
02:22:54,969 --> 02:22:56,889
I think that's what may have just happened.

1502
02:22:56,889 --> 02:22:57,530
It's possible.

1503
02:22:58,950 --> 02:23:01,190
All right, this one is right over here.

1504
02:23:07,190 --> 02:23:10,389
Sorry, but when I go to an address,

1505
02:23:10,389 --> 02:23:11,829
asses need to be whooped.

1506
02:23:12,469 --> 02:23:13,750
All right, so take a look down here.

1507
02:23:14,469 --> 02:23:17,829
We've got to get spotted.

1508
02:23:18,629 --> 02:23:24,899
Okay, I'm hiding currently behind the mailbox.

1509
02:23:25,700 --> 02:23:26,680
Where are you at?

1510
02:23:30,569 --> 02:23:32,329
Are we doing an aerial attack?

1511
02:23:32,329 --> 02:23:33,209
I'm going to wait for you to go in

1512
02:23:33,209 --> 02:23:33,930
and then I'll go into.

1513
02:23:33,930 --> 02:23:35,530
And it's, by the way, silent takedowns

1514
02:23:36,579 --> 02:23:37,700
and try to be undetected.

1515
02:23:38,260 --> 02:23:40,020
Be a little hard.

1516
02:23:43,540 --> 02:23:46,500
Okay, you get the mob brawler on the other side

1517
02:23:47,219 --> 02:23:49,620
and I'll get the mob brawler down right underneath me.

1518
02:23:50,500 --> 02:23:52,899
That way, we'll be able to eliminate both of those.

1519
02:23:52,899 --> 02:23:54,659
Wait, there's another mob brawler over here.

1520
02:23:55,379 --> 02:23:56,899
I'm thinking you jump in and I, yeah.

1521
02:23:56,899 --> 02:23:58,180
Well, because there's only four of them.

1522
02:23:58,180 --> 02:24:01,059
So we're not going to be able to do it silently, I'm saying.

1523
02:24:01,059 --> 02:24:03,219
Unless you also do an aerial attack.

1524
02:24:03,219 --> 02:24:04,180
All right, I feel what you mean.

1525
02:24:04,180 --> 02:24:05,219
Coming up there.

1526
02:24:05,219 --> 02:24:07,780
All right, so I'm going to do an aerial attack silent kill.

1527
02:24:08,979 --> 02:24:09,620
Can I get up here?

1528
02:24:10,889 --> 02:24:11,450
They can't see me.

1529
02:24:11,450 --> 02:24:12,569
All right, see the one I'm right above?

1530
02:24:13,799 --> 02:24:16,600
Okay, that's the one I was going to do, but hold on.

1531
02:24:16,600 --> 02:24:18,840
There's one right next to that one.

1532
02:24:18,840 --> 02:24:21,479
I'm trying to get to, I'm trying to get to that right now.

1533
02:24:22,200 --> 02:24:24,360
Trying to get to a better position, a better perch,

1534
02:24:24,360 --> 02:24:26,200
so I can do an aerial attack on the other one.

1535
02:24:26,920 --> 02:24:29,399
Just drove by, something just flew by the screen.

1536
02:24:29,399 --> 02:24:31,000
Okay, I got a silent takedown.

1537
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,079
All right, three, two, one, go.

1538
02:24:38,010 --> 02:24:39,370
Good, all right.

1539
02:24:40,250 --> 02:24:41,770
Watch out, let's wrap around this way.

1540
02:24:42,489 --> 02:24:43,940
Wait, I'm going to get this guy now.

1541
02:24:44,500 --> 02:24:46,389
Oh wait, he's not.

1542
02:24:46,389 --> 02:24:48,950
Dude, there is a car just driving by.

1543
02:24:49,750 --> 02:24:50,870
I swear to God, that's a car.

1544
02:24:50,870 --> 02:24:51,430
Slow that down.

1545
02:24:54,790 --> 02:24:55,989
There's cops right there,

1546
02:24:55,989 --> 02:24:57,510
and they're not even doing anything about it.

1547
02:24:57,510 --> 02:24:58,229
That's crazy.

1548
02:25:01,110 --> 02:25:01,989
All right, there are three.

1549
02:25:04,100 --> 02:25:05,700
All right, they've been beating the shit out of this person

1550
02:25:05,700 --> 02:25:06,819
for like five straight minutes.

1551
02:25:06,819 --> 02:25:08,340
We need to like act.

1552
02:25:08,340 --> 02:25:10,389
Okay, I'm going to get this other back.

1553
02:25:10,389 --> 02:25:10,870
Oh, shit.

1554
02:25:15,399 --> 02:25:15,879
Oops.

1555
02:25:15,879 --> 02:25:16,200
Uh-oh.

1556
02:25:17,940 --> 02:25:20,020
Defeat enemies undetected is done.

1557
02:25:20,020 --> 02:25:20,659
Not quite.

1558
02:25:20,659 --> 02:25:21,700
I haven't been detected yet.

1559
02:25:22,340 --> 02:25:27,940
Just keep them distracted.

1560
02:25:27,940 --> 02:25:28,340
We'll get it.

1561
02:25:31,159 --> 02:25:34,790
It doesn't count.

1562
02:25:39,399 --> 02:25:39,799
Nice.

1563
02:25:41,020 --> 02:25:41,659
There's one more.

1564
02:25:42,299 --> 02:25:43,370
All right, we got it.

1565
02:25:43,370 --> 02:25:44,569
Crime solved.

1566
02:25:44,569 --> 02:25:45,129
We got it.

1567
02:25:45,129 --> 02:25:46,329
Let's make a check on this person.

1568
02:25:46,329 --> 02:25:46,969
Make sure they're okay.

1569
02:25:47,530 --> 02:25:48,329
Are you all right, sir?

1570
02:25:49,049 --> 02:25:50,170
Thanks, Ero.

1571
02:25:50,170 --> 02:25:52,969
Might be a good idea to head home.

1572
02:25:52,969 --> 02:25:54,010
Yeah, get out of here.

1573
02:25:55,129 --> 02:25:56,649
I'm shooting it in his vicinity,

1574
02:25:56,649 --> 02:25:58,329
so he's like afraid, you know what I mean?

1575
02:25:59,420 --> 02:26:01,340
Wait, yeah, give him a swift kick in the ass.

1576
02:26:01,979 --> 02:26:03,180
That's right.

1577
02:26:03,180 --> 02:26:04,059
Get out of here.

1578
02:26:04,860 --> 02:26:06,969
Teach you something about

1579
02:26:07,930 --> 02:26:13,239
trying to meddle in criminal affairs.

1580
02:26:14,520 --> 02:26:15,159
All right, I'm ready.

1581
02:26:17,719 --> 02:26:19,000
Okay, we solved that crime.

1582
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:19,959
That was pretty easy.

1583
02:26:19,959 --> 02:26:20,760
I mean, God damn.

1584
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:21,879
That was pretty soft crime.

1585
02:26:22,920 --> 02:26:25,159
Yeah, felt pretty good.

1586
02:26:26,969 --> 02:26:29,930
So there's one, 212.

1587
02:26:30,569 --> 02:26:31,610
Let's do this hard one.

1588
02:26:31,610 --> 02:26:32,889
This one's leaving 263.

1589
02:26:32,889 --> 02:26:34,409
How do you, where is it?

1590
02:26:34,409 --> 02:26:35,610
So I don't know what it is on yours,

1591
02:26:35,610 --> 02:26:37,290
but okay, on the bottom left of your screen,

1592
02:26:37,930 --> 02:26:40,170
whatever the rightmost ability is,

1593
02:26:40,170 --> 02:26:42,010
is to see what's around you,

1594
02:26:42,010 --> 02:26:42,889
like the AR mode.

1595
02:26:46,120 --> 02:26:47,559
No, it's not.

1596
02:26:50,760 --> 02:26:52,760
If you add, so for me, it's down on the D-pad.

1597
02:26:52,760 --> 02:26:54,600
It's on the lower left of your abilities.

1598
02:26:54,600 --> 02:26:56,760
We heal and call the bike and emote.

1599
02:26:57,479 --> 02:26:58,520
On the map, you mean?

1600
02:26:59,159 --> 02:27:01,000
Oh, no, just like the lower left of your screen,

1601
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:02,040
like whatever that button is,

1602
02:27:02,040 --> 02:27:03,559
all the way to the right above your health bar.

1603
02:27:04,520 --> 02:27:07,399
Oh, I see it 160 meters away.

1604
02:27:07,399 --> 02:27:08,520
Purple, is that the one?

1605
02:27:08,520 --> 02:27:14,979
Yep.

1606
02:27:14,979 --> 02:27:16,809
Oh, well, is it 100?

1607
02:27:19,260 --> 02:27:20,219
Where is it?

1608
02:27:20,219 --> 02:27:21,340
It's this, I think.

1609
02:27:21,340 --> 02:27:22,780
I think I just way pointed it.

1610
02:27:22,780 --> 02:27:23,420
Hold on.

1611
02:27:23,420 --> 02:27:24,379
It's whatever the one is red.

1612
02:27:24,379 --> 02:27:25,340
It's a red one.

1613
02:27:25,340 --> 02:27:27,420
Oh, it's a red one, not a purple one.

1614
02:27:27,420 --> 02:27:30,219
Okay, I did the wrong thing.

1615
02:27:30,219 --> 02:27:31,340
Wonder what the purple one even means.

1616
02:27:32,139 --> 02:27:34,299
Red one is 256 meters away.

1617
02:27:34,540 --> 02:27:35,739
Does that mean it's hard?

1618
02:27:35,739 --> 02:27:37,180
I think that's a difficult one.

1619
02:27:38,940 --> 02:27:40,459
Wait, let me look at it real quick

1620
02:27:40,459 --> 02:27:42,219
and then try to pinpoint it on the map.

1621
02:27:43,610 --> 02:27:44,090
Oh, yeah.

1622
02:27:45,479 --> 02:27:47,000
That is his difficulty very low.

1623
02:27:47,719 --> 02:27:48,280
Very low.

1624
02:27:49,319 --> 02:27:53,510
Yeah, let's go to the purple one.

1625
02:27:53,510 --> 02:27:54,389
I know what it means.

1626
02:27:54,389 --> 02:27:55,590
We'll do the purple one.

1627
02:27:55,590 --> 02:27:57,030
I don't know what that means, though.

1628
02:27:57,750 --> 02:28:02,340
But again, thank you, Warner Brothers,

1629
02:28:02,340 --> 02:28:04,100
again, for sponsoring this segment of the stream.

1630
02:28:05,299 --> 02:28:05,860
It's out now.

1631
02:28:06,739 --> 02:28:08,180
Both of our panels down below

1632
02:28:08,180 --> 02:28:09,860
should have a image of the link.

1633
02:28:10,819 --> 02:28:13,139
The game is currently on PlayStation 5,

1634
02:28:13,780 --> 02:28:17,299
Xbox Series S, Series X, PC.

1635
02:28:17,299 --> 02:28:17,940
It's out now.

1636
02:28:17,940 --> 02:28:18,819
It came out yesterday.

1637
02:28:19,620 --> 02:28:20,500
Wait, it's down here?

1638
02:28:21,700 --> 02:28:24,280
There is co-op, as you can see.

1639
02:28:24,280 --> 02:28:25,979
Oh, my God.

1640
02:28:28,600 --> 02:28:29,399
Are these criminals

1641
02:28:29,399 --> 02:28:30,600
or are they just trying to get in their car?

1642
02:28:32,069 --> 02:28:32,469
I don't know.

1643
02:28:32,469 --> 02:28:33,510
But you're having a hard time

1644
02:28:33,510 --> 02:28:34,950
whipping that ass, I see.

1645
02:28:36,860 --> 02:28:37,420
I did all right.

1646
02:28:37,420 --> 02:28:39,180
They were going to break into a car, I think.

1647
02:28:40,739 --> 02:28:42,979
Good thing we were here to solve that crime.

1648
02:28:43,620 --> 02:28:45,159
I feel like that was kind of overkill.

1649
02:28:47,270 --> 02:28:49,430
It's like, oh, they're breaking into a car

1650
02:28:49,430 --> 02:28:50,950
and all of a sudden it's like you got us two here

1651
02:28:50,950 --> 02:28:52,309
with like our superpowers.

1652
02:28:53,110 --> 02:28:54,870
Like just throwing ice at people and shit.

1653
02:28:55,670 --> 02:28:58,069
I don't think that was the purple one.

1654
02:28:58,069 --> 02:28:58,389
Oh, no.

1655
02:28:58,389 --> 02:28:59,030
Yeah, it wasn't.

1656
02:28:59,030 --> 02:29:00,069
I was going to say that was not...

1657
02:29:00,709 --> 02:29:02,549
There's one over here.

1658
02:29:02,549 --> 02:29:03,190
There's one over here.

1659
02:29:03,190 --> 02:29:04,469
I thought it was.

1660
02:29:08,360 --> 02:29:08,680
Right here.

1661
02:29:12,200 --> 02:29:12,760
Oh, wait.

1662
02:29:12,760 --> 02:29:13,239
It's not.

1663
02:29:13,959 --> 02:29:14,760
I'm still going.

1664
02:29:17,559 --> 02:29:18,920
We can do this really quickly.

1665
02:29:19,799 --> 02:29:20,920
I'll go for a stealth kill

1666
02:29:20,920 --> 02:29:22,760
and you go for a silent take down from above.

1667
02:29:22,760 --> 02:29:35,780
You just like Mario jumped on his head.

1668
02:29:39,780 --> 02:29:40,340
That's right.

1669
02:29:42,139 --> 02:29:43,739
That was not a purple one, was it?

1670
02:29:43,739 --> 02:29:44,700
That was the purple one.

1671
02:29:44,700 --> 02:29:46,620
No, no, I think there's...

1672
02:29:46,620 --> 02:29:49,590
No, there's another purple marker on mine.

1673
02:29:53,500 --> 02:29:54,139
Difficulty low.

1674
02:29:54,139 --> 02:29:54,940
Let's do a hard one.

1675
02:29:55,989 --> 02:29:56,549
I don't...

1676
02:29:56,549 --> 02:29:57,590
There isn't any...

1677
02:29:57,590 --> 02:29:58,549
Like it's not...

1678
02:29:58,549 --> 02:29:59,670
I have no hard ones.

1679
02:29:59,670 --> 02:30:00,149
Oh, I think...

1680
02:30:00,149 --> 02:30:00,950
Yeah, because we're low.

1681
02:30:01,670 --> 02:30:03,190
Let's do the one that is bright.

1682
02:30:03,829 --> 02:30:05,190
Let's just do this one then.

1683
02:30:05,190 --> 02:30:06,790
This is called the Freaks.

1684
02:30:06,790 --> 02:30:07,590
I have it marked.

1685
02:30:08,309 --> 02:30:09,350
We can call it for this if you want.

1686
02:30:10,069 --> 02:30:10,309
Okay.

1687
02:30:11,590 --> 02:30:12,149
Lead the way.

1688
02:30:13,030 --> 02:30:14,149
A lot of fun playing with you, dude.

1689
02:30:19,739 --> 02:30:20,860
Absolutely.

1690
02:30:20,860 --> 02:30:21,659
Anytime.

1691
02:30:28,739 --> 02:30:29,059
All right.

1692
02:30:29,059 --> 02:30:32,340
So I don't know what exactly this is, but we'll find out.

1693
02:30:32,340 --> 02:30:33,620
We're about to find out.

1694
02:30:41,639 --> 02:30:42,760
I did say it back.

1695
02:30:42,760 --> 02:30:43,639
Why is Chad saying it?

1696
02:30:43,639 --> 02:30:44,600
Wait, did you not hear me?

1697
02:30:45,159 --> 02:30:45,639
No, I did.

1698
02:30:45,639 --> 02:30:45,879
Yeah.

1699
02:30:46,600 --> 02:30:48,120
I said, absolutely.

1700
02:30:48,120 --> 02:30:49,000
Anytime.

1701
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:49,479
I heard it.

1702
02:30:50,790 --> 02:30:52,229
I had a lot of fun, too.

1703
02:30:54,709 --> 02:30:55,110
All right.

1704
02:30:55,110 --> 02:30:56,950
So there's a lot of...

1705
02:30:56,950 --> 02:30:57,989
That's why I was begging him.

1706
02:30:59,670 --> 02:31:00,389
Literally.

1707
02:31:00,389 --> 02:31:00,790
Whoa.

1708
02:31:00,790 --> 02:31:01,430
Two stars.

1709
02:31:01,430 --> 02:31:03,510
I mean, you can tell that story if you want.

1710
02:31:04,149 --> 02:31:07,770
I was like, no, I don't want to play with you.

1711
02:31:07,770 --> 02:31:08,409
You suck.

1712
02:31:08,409 --> 02:31:09,370
You're bad at the game.

1713
02:31:10,899 --> 02:31:12,260
And I was like, please, Yerma.

1714
02:31:13,139 --> 02:31:13,780
I need you.

1715
02:31:14,340 --> 02:31:15,620
Aerial attack time.

1716
02:31:16,500 --> 02:31:18,979
Aerial attack doesn't kill people, which is weird.

1717
02:31:19,940 --> 02:31:22,420
Wait, why are cops shooting at me now?

1718
02:31:25,350 --> 02:31:25,909
All right.

1719
02:31:25,909 --> 02:31:26,309
Let's get them.

1720
02:31:28,139 --> 02:31:28,860
Is that...

1721
02:31:28,860 --> 02:31:31,500
Did cops shoot you in your game, too?

1722
02:31:31,500 --> 02:31:33,659
They did, but I ran somebody over with my car.

1723
02:31:33,659 --> 02:31:35,340
So, I mean, it made sense.

1724
02:31:36,379 --> 02:31:38,940
Like, I was like running people over.

1725
02:31:38,940 --> 02:31:40,780
I was attacking people.

1726
02:31:40,780 --> 02:31:43,579
Now I'm hitting these cops and they're not actually doing anything.

1727
02:31:44,700 --> 02:31:47,260
I was driving into people and shooting at them.

1728
02:31:47,260 --> 02:31:49,500
It was a disaster the first 10 minutes of the stream.

1729
02:31:50,299 --> 02:31:51,340
I played it for the first time.

1730
02:31:57,379 --> 02:31:57,780
Damn.

1731
02:32:00,860 --> 02:32:01,979
Whoa, chill, bro.

1732
02:32:01,979 --> 02:32:03,180
Cops are shooting me, too.

1733
02:32:03,979 --> 02:32:08,620
Are they still mad at you?

1734
02:32:09,579 --> 02:32:09,819
No.

1735
02:32:10,540 --> 02:32:12,700
I think they were accidentally shooting me.

1736
02:32:13,899 --> 02:32:14,620
Hey, oh, no.

1737
02:32:15,659 --> 02:32:17,459
Wait, they're running away.

1738
02:32:17,459 --> 02:32:18,100
Run away.

1739
02:32:18,100 --> 02:32:19,059
Get out of here.

1740
02:32:19,059 --> 02:32:19,559
Get.

1741
02:32:22,069 --> 02:32:23,430
That's how I clear an area, though.

1742
02:32:23,430 --> 02:32:24,950
That's just like my signature move.

1743
02:32:28,489 --> 02:32:29,049
Okay.

1744
02:32:29,049 --> 02:32:29,450
All right.

1745
02:32:29,450 --> 02:32:30,729
You want to do one more or are you good?

1746
02:32:31,290 --> 02:32:32,090
It's up to you.

1747
02:32:32,090 --> 02:32:33,770
I'll do one more if you want to do one more.

1748
02:32:33,770 --> 02:32:34,969
You need for the guns down.

1749
02:32:35,940 --> 02:32:37,620
I will never put my guns down.

1750
02:32:38,180 --> 02:32:39,059
America, damn it.

1751
02:32:39,059 --> 02:32:39,780
It's Gotham.

1752
02:32:40,680 --> 02:32:43,239
I mean, I don't know what this one is, but we can go to it.

1753
02:32:43,239 --> 02:32:43,739
Let's do it.

1754
02:32:44,360 --> 02:32:46,579
Somebody just called you out.

1755
02:32:48,329 --> 02:32:49,129
Yeah, she did.

1756
02:32:55,299 --> 02:32:55,799
What?

1757
02:32:56,520 --> 02:33:07,260
So this one looks like the previous one that we just did.

1758
02:33:07,260 --> 02:33:09,420
I think maybe we didn't get rid of them all.

1759
02:33:11,790 --> 02:33:13,469
No, it cleared it for me.

1760
02:33:14,190 --> 02:33:28,989
Oh, she's an AK.

1761
02:33:28,989 --> 02:33:29,950
Let's go.

1762
02:33:29,950 --> 02:33:31,790
This one's a little bit more challenging.

1763
02:33:31,790 --> 02:33:32,350
Just kidding.

1764
02:33:33,149 --> 02:33:33,629
Whoa.

1765
02:33:33,629 --> 02:33:34,030
Watch out.

1766
02:33:34,030 --> 02:33:34,909
She's aiming for you.

1767
02:33:40,600 --> 02:33:41,239
Yeah.

1768
02:33:41,239 --> 02:33:43,000
Look, team attack, team attack, team attack.

1769
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:43,479
Come over here.

1770
02:33:44,280 --> 02:33:44,840
Team attack.

1771
02:33:45,979 --> 02:33:50,780
Oh, oh, that was sick.

1772
02:33:50,780 --> 02:33:51,979
Yeah, that was so again.

1773
02:33:53,530 --> 02:33:55,530
Oh, I'm just getting warmed up.

1774
02:33:56,920 --> 02:33:57,420
Damn it.

1775
02:33:59,469 --> 02:34:00,190
That's pretty cool.

1776
02:34:05,549 --> 02:34:05,950
All right.

1777
02:34:05,950 --> 02:34:06,590
How are you doing?

1778
02:34:06,590 --> 02:34:07,549
Is that you good?

1779
02:34:08,350 --> 02:34:08,909
I'm good.

1780
02:34:08,909 --> 02:34:09,409
Yeah.

1781
02:34:10,379 --> 02:34:11,020
All right, German.

1782
02:34:11,020 --> 02:34:11,659
Thank you so much.

1783
02:34:14,059 --> 02:34:19,709
Thank you to Warner Brothers for allowing us to play this wonderful game.

1784
02:34:20,270 --> 02:34:26,829
Gotham Knights, which is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox XS, and the PC.

1785
02:34:27,790 --> 02:34:28,190
That's right.

1786
02:34:28,190 --> 02:34:32,190
Get it by clicking on our respective tabs underneath.

1787
02:34:34,479 --> 02:34:34,799
Great.

1788
02:34:35,950 --> 02:34:36,270
All right.

1789
02:34:36,270 --> 02:34:36,670
Bye.

1790
02:34:36,670 --> 02:34:36,829
Yeah.

1791
02:34:36,829 --> 02:34:37,629
Thanks for playing, dude.

1792
02:34:37,629 --> 02:34:38,829
Well, I'll talk to you soon.

1793
02:34:42,440 --> 02:34:43,799
Cool.

1794
02:34:43,799 --> 02:34:44,120
Okay.

1795
02:34:45,850 --> 02:34:47,610
So that was Gotham Knights.

1796
02:34:47,610 --> 02:34:49,040
Oh, I got kicked.

1797
02:34:49,040 --> 02:34:50,920
That was Gotham Knights.

1798
02:34:51,559 --> 02:34:54,809
That's going to conclude the sponsor segment

1799
02:34:54,809 --> 02:34:57,209
and that's going to conclude the sponsored streams for Gotham Knights.

1800
02:34:58,809 --> 02:35:00,729
Huge, huge thank you to Warner Brothers.

1801
02:35:03,159 --> 02:35:04,360
Like I said before,

1802
02:35:04,360 --> 02:35:09,719
WB has been an unbelievable supporter of the stream, so I'm happy to play.

1803
02:35:11,440 --> 02:35:12,239
Hope you guys enjoyed it.

1804
02:35:12,239 --> 02:35:13,280
Hope it was fun to watch.

1805
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:15,840
The game is available right now.

1806
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:17,129
You like what you saw?

1807
02:35:17,129 --> 02:35:18,010
It's available right now.

1808
02:35:20,780 --> 02:35:27,549
With that, I'm going to end the stream.

1809
02:35:27,549 --> 02:35:28,989
Thanks to Hassan Tupac for playing.

1810
02:35:28,989 --> 02:35:31,790
I mean, he was just, you know, check out the co-op.

1811
02:35:31,790 --> 02:35:33,389
Why not?

1812
02:35:33,389 --> 02:35:35,790
And I will see you guys in a few days.

1813
02:35:35,790 --> 02:35:37,950
See you on the 25th.

1814
02:35:37,950 --> 02:35:42,139
25th at probably around 4 Pacific, I want to say.

1815
02:35:42,139 --> 02:35:45,360
I'm going to start doing Halloween stuff.

1816
02:35:45,360 --> 02:35:47,840
I might play, I don't know, I'll figure it out.

1817
02:35:47,840 --> 02:35:54,959
I'll be in pre-stream on the 25th.

1818
02:35:54,959 --> 02:35:57,760
Maybe a little bit early, maybe like 3 Pacific.

1819
02:35:57,760 --> 02:36:02,479
But yeah, thanks for watching.

1820
02:36:02,479 --> 02:36:03,959
See you guys later.

1821
02:36:04,680 --> 02:36:14,299
We'll just kind of play it out here.

1822
02:36:14,299 --> 02:36:14,860
Very cool.

1823
02:36:15,500 --> 02:36:18,840
Can we get one scorn?

1824
02:36:18,840 --> 02:36:23,420
You want one scorn?

1825
02:36:23,420 --> 02:36:25,870
You guys have been good.

1826
02:36:25,870 --> 02:36:26,750
You guys have been good.

1827
02:36:26,750 --> 02:36:43,209
I'll give you a scorn.

1828
02:36:43,209 --> 02:36:44,250
No, we haven't.

1829
02:36:44,250 --> 02:36:45,129
We've been good.

1830
02:36:45,129 --> 02:36:50,750
Probably you guys have not been good.

1831
02:36:50,750 --> 02:36:52,989
You guys have been, you behaved pretty well today.

1832
02:36:52,989 --> 02:37:00,030
Yeah, I'll give you, okay, here it comes.

1833
02:37:00,030 --> 02:37:01,079
Prepare yourself.

1834
02:37:01,079 --> 02:37:07,770
It's on its way right now in three, two, scorn.

1835
02:37:07,770 --> 02:37:15,440
That's so funny that he scorned.

1836
02:37:15,440 --> 02:37:23,100
Yeah, good night guys.

1837
02:37:23,100 --> 02:37:23,819
See you soon.

1838
02:37:23,819 --> 02:37:25,100
Take care of yourselves.

1839
02:37:25,100 --> 02:37:25,899
Goodbye.

1840
02:37:25,899 --> 02:37:28,940
See you on the 25th around 3 Pacific.

1841
02:37:28,940 --> 02:37:29,899
We'll figure it out.

1842
02:37:29,899 --> 02:38:30,299
See you soon.
