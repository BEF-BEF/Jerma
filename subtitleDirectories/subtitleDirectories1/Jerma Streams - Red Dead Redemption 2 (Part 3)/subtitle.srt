1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:07,910
Let's open it up. There it is. Let me just make this different.

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,189
So I have a confession to make here, and I'm sorry to all the people that were

3
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:19,300
expecting it. Zero playing off stream. I played a little bit off stream. I did

4
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,339
some side stuff, because it was just, I just couldn't stream with my internet,

5
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:25,780
obviously. And I'm not sure how much longer we're going to get of being

6
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,739
green. So by the way, just want to make sure I say this.

7
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:32,899
See you soon. Thanks for watching everybody. It's been

8
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:36,899
pretty fun stream so far, but this might just go to zero because it just does

9
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:42,869
that at like seven o'clock. So I did do some stuff off the

10
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:48,149
camera here. Let's go ahead and get it on the screen. There it is.

11
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:57,179
And I can go like this. All right, so where were we? I did one

12
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:03,820
mission where I unlocked the fence. I'm an idiot. Let me just update

13
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:12,180
this. RdRd2. RdR2. I can't, what do I think? A title for this.

14
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:18,870
What should I title? It takes me like the amount of time to create a

15
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,290
character in a game. To make a title in a game. Just do the boring

16
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,930
stuff off stream. That was kind of the idea.

17
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:29,769
Was to make a little bit of money, do some hunting, and trade some stuff,

18
00:01:29,769 --> 00:01:36,390
make some money, pay off my bounties, and now here we are ready to play.

19
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:44,549
Okay, how about RdRd, how about just Red Dead Redemption gameplay?

20
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:50,780
Red Dead Redemption 2 gameplay only. 480p. Am I trying to get people to

21
00:01:50,780 --> 00:02:03,939
not come here? I don't understand. Am I trying to just lose everybody?

22
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:13,800
How about Red Dead, how about RdR2? No gameplay. Only commentary.

23
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:34,120
That's worse. How about, I'm just doing RdRd2 continue. Done.

24
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,620
Horseball stream. Oh Red Dead Redemption, okay.

25
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:45,319
I got it. Boring title. Whatever. Don't you guys know, don't ever judge a

26
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:51,080
book by its cover. Open up the first chapter and read it.

27
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,659
The Reddit Redemption. Alright, so here we go. Let's uh,

28
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:59,139
let's open her up. Wait, hold on a minute. My microphone is

29
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:03,379
synced up. Okay. Just making sure I was synced.

30
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:06,500
Make sure the audio here is telling me. Make sure we do this now.

31
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,020
You should be hearing Lethal League ball hit every time I go

32
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:25,699
duh duh duh. Okay, I'm ready. I did get another horse too by the way.

33
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:30,740
Just go, just go. I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

34
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,860
Those of you that were here for Lethal League and you are, don't want to be

35
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,780
spoiled, you don't want to see anymore. Every streamer plays Red Dead

36
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,500
Redemption 2, every single one, I understand.

37
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:51,449
Thanks for coming. See you soon. Uh, where's my horse over here?

38
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:56,069
Toy Story Woody's Adventure. Oh, I can't.

39
00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:00,060
I can't take him to camp, that's right. Let me figure out what I want to do.

40
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:05,740
Let's go. There's a loan shark mission over here.

41
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:10,180
This looks like a, let's go to Maryland. That sounds like a plan. Oh

42
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:18,220
no. Hmm. Don't ask that you get Micah out of

43
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,379
the gym. Yeah, we've been on this one. Let's go to this one.

44
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:31,899
Just do it. We were, that was a story mission

45
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:41,029
like six hours ago. I think it's time to do it.

46
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:43,350
This is a different horse. Yes, it's because I stabled the other one because

47
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,430
I didn't want to get too fatigued. Those of you that can see what

48
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,870
happened when a gamer or a horse, it doesn't matter if you're a

49
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:54,389
human, everybody gets gamer fatigue. It happens.

50
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:59,350
What's this horse's name? The horse's name is Thunder.

51
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,639
I don't know, I was eating. I had fucking like a bowl of spaghetti in one

52
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:08,060
hand. I just did the easiest thing I can think of.

53
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,660
Whisper's still fine, yeah. Whisper's around still.

54
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:25,610
Just stabled. Oh my god, we got an event over here.

55
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:34,680
Please, anyone. Okay, what's what's up? You all right?

56
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:47,660
Medicine or a siphon? Suck out the venom.

57
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,720
That's an option. Then you know what? This doesn't work. This doesn't work.

58
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,379
No, it doesn't. I saw I saw like a clickbait YouTube video that said it

59
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:11,930
didn't work. You saved my life. You're gonna give me

60
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:21,899
money or something? All right, money. Treasure map. Family

61
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:35,379
platinum jewel. That's it. Keep your eyes on the ground.

62
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:41,379
Let's go. That's it. All right, fine.

63
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:47,459
Fine. I saved, yeah I know I saved him, but doesn't he like give me

64
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:50,620
something in return? You gotta have like something in your

65
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:56,069
pocket, man. All right, yeah, he'll show up later.

66
00:06:56,069 --> 00:07:06,579
We're good. Greedy streamer wants... oh wait wait wait wait wait wait wait

67
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:09,959
we got a loan shark mission right here.

68
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:15,509
I gotta collect the debt from somebody. First of all,

69
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:23,050
put the bow away? Give me like the shotgun. No no no no no no no no no

70
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:26,759
listen. Okay, give me the double-barred

71
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:30,819
shotgun. Don't bark. Don't bark. Don't bark.

72
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:35,980
These loan sharking missions you have to go collect. What why would you

73
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,589
put... what are you doing? What the hell was that?

74
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:46,970
I didn't do that. Okay, let's find him. Usually they've run.

75
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:53,300
I'm here to collect. Hey, looking for someone?

76
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:59,689
I am actually. Ah, who's this then? These cards is the only world team

77
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:05,160
we're likely to meet. You're asking the wrong feller.

78
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:11,399
Okay, the outside? They're just playing poker. Where's the

79
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:17,850
actual dude? Let's explore the area. Eventually we'll find him.

80
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:26,199
There you are. Do you smoke sir? This is not a loan shark.

81
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:29,639
Not as much as you. Oh no no don't worry about these. Actually

82
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:32,759
let me take some. Smoking and other hobbies. Oh thank you.

83
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:36,360
What are all the cigarettes for? Were you heading on a long journey or

84
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,519
something? No no no nothing like that at all.

85
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,960
I'm just interested in the cards. Okay. Cigarette cards.

86
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,399
Oh you got me? Yeah. Oh this is okay. Let me take a look. Come on. I actually have

87
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,120
quite a few of these, don't I? Yeah, I'll pay a good price.

88
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,080
Okay. Ah, nothing I haven't got. Oh bullshit. The value isn't

89
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,919
completing the debt. Sometimes I'll smoke up to 200 cigarettes in one day

90
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:59,639
just so I can keep opening the packs. I wish I could explain to you the

91
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,519
pleasure and the pain I get out of collecting these babies.

92
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:07,559
Sure, well it sounds thrilling. Yeah it is. Not to mention the vast

93
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:10,519
amounts of life-reaffirming cigarettes I get to smoke.

94
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:13,879
Oh. Sucking poison doesn't work. You get it on your mouth and it goes in

95
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:16,840
your bloodstream, see?

96
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,840
Meow meows.

97
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:49,960
There's so much side content in this game.

98
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:58,200
It's insane. There's so much to do.

99
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:04,740
All this stuff just, you don't even have to do any of this.

100
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,710
It's wild. Collect all the cigarette cards and mail the completed sets to

101
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:13,080
Phineas. Well, so we're out of this way.

102
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,330
We're still, yeah, yeah, yeah. 12 cards, that's that.

103
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:29,480
Still on the trek to go to see Micah. Good, good, good, good. Don't run into the

104
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:36,250
train. That would be bad. It's nothing

105
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:46,009
impressive. It's still fun though. You've been

106
00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:48,570
hunting in Red Dead Redemption 2 for the past week and hardly done any

107
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:53,139
story stuff. Yeah, it's a wild west is such a

108
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:56,500
great setting. There's so much cool shit in this

109
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,580
time period that like it's surprising that not more

110
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:08,889
people try to do it. I definitely have to try to like

111
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:12,200
road rage somewhere. Well, we actually have to go this

112
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,700
way. We could use a BAP too. The horse is

113
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:34,899
kind of dirty. Wild West VR game. That actually

114
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:39,269
might get my attention. You would actually probably sit me

115
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:44,629
down for 45 minutes straight. What the fuck are you doing?

116
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:52,490
These pigs? These dogs? Oh boy!

117
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:10,259
Oh dogs everywhere!

118
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:32,220
Is there another one? There's another one! Oh, what the fuck was that for?

119
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:44,200
Okay, one hit and I was dead there. Damn. Leave him alone. Rip horse.

120
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:54,299
Horses. The horse is fine. Poor. Well, these are going to be worth nothing.

121
00:12:54,299 --> 00:13:01,269
It's because I ran into a rock. Oh, I have the pelt on me. Come here.

122
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:09,960
The car is dead. Stop running into shit and come over here.

123
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:15,659
It's definitely not even worth taking these. I've shot so many holes in them.

124
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:20,679
No, forget it. I mean, maybe it's worth it for the meat.

125
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:34,940
Okay, I can cook the meat. I'll take it. Why did I kill the wild autos?

126
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:38,620
Because the wild auto is all ganged up on me

127
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:49,460
and tried to kill me at the same time. The game meat.

128
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:58,009
I can sell that. I use it. What's this guy's problem?

129
00:13:58,009 --> 00:14:03,700
Oh, is he mad about the wolves?

130
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:10,470
Where the hell is this? Is this the same road, man? What, I'm not allowed to

131
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:32,600
take the same highway as you? Good morning. All right, let's go.

132
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:40,070
Let me first want to drop and gets the gold. Why?

133
00:14:40,070 --> 00:15:05,509
Why is this happening? It's an ambush. Okay, are these guys in the wolves

134
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:11,860
working together? Seriously, do they send their like

135
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:22,679
World of Warcraft fucking pets at me first? I don't understand.

136
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:25,879
Everybody wants to be dead. I paid off on my bounties too. What's up with

137
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:35,669
this? You're good. Let's get some free stuff.

138
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,710
Probably old Drew. That guy had five dollars. Damn.

139
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:52,840
Okay, this is a witness, right? He doesn't care. Good.

140
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,440
Sometimes they stop and they get very upset at you.

141
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,039
These guys have a decent amount of money. Gold wedding ring.

142
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:16,580
Where's this dead horse? These are random dudes. Five bucks.

143
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:25,019
Where's the dead horse? The horse is back there.

144
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:38,889
Let me feed mine. Up on the hill here.

145
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:53,269
I don't see it on the minimap. Where are you horse?

146
00:16:53,269 --> 00:17:12,779
Where the hell feed your house? Well, oh well.

147
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:22,220
It's back where you parked it. No, I didn't go. Did I go that far?

148
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,549
Let's just take a look back here because they were chasing me from like

149
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:30,700
over here. Okay, there they are. Are these the wolves?

150
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:38,700
Are these the wolves? Are you a horse? No, you're a wolf.

151
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,940
Well, well, let's go. I ain't gonna search around for it.

152
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:50,740
It's up on the hill where the horse was standing.

153
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:59,430
Wouldn't have to show up on the minimap. So many random things.

154
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:16,859
So many random things. Come on, man. Hey, what's up?

155
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:21,740
You scared me. Boiled Satan? Yeah, I get that a lot.

156
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,779
What? What do you mean? What's that you got there?

157
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:28,460
You ain't interested in no scrap paper. It's nothing.

158
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:33,019
Just something for wiping. He'll freak out. He doesn't know where I am.

159
00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:51,700
Well, I guess to go now. What? Hey, why the hurry?

160
00:18:51,700 --> 00:19:02,230
Animal cruelty? What? This guy's an animal?

161
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:08,490
What? Hold on. I got his map. Animal cruelty. You've acquired a map

162
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:11,609
leading to a treasure that is rumored to be cursed. Many have died looking

163
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:30,089
for it. Who's the witness to animal cruelty?

164
00:19:30,089 --> 00:19:35,430
Crime reported. Oh, hold on a minute. Wait, wait, wait.

165
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:40,089
They don't know the whole story there. That's absolute bullshit.

166
00:19:40,089 --> 00:19:45,609
I was wildly, rabidly attacked by animals and I had to save myself.

167
00:19:45,609 --> 00:19:49,609
I was going to be killed. This is actually a pretty good horse.

168
00:19:49,609 --> 00:20:17,769
He's okay, right? Okay. New horse. I'm gonna get out of here now.

169
00:20:17,769 --> 00:20:22,940
How far away are they? They're not gonna find me. I'm 50 miles ahead of you.

170
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:30,619
I shot a horse during a fight with bandits? Well, what am I supposed to

171
00:20:30,619 --> 00:20:39,339
do about that? I'm getting bombarded by all sides.

172
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:46,759
Thunder's fine. Thunder's coming behind us. I need to claim this is my own, though.

173
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:53,859
I'm gonna go to Stables. Is there a stable down here?

174
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:57,140
Cruelty. Well, at least I got the map here.

175
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:01,299
I tried to be nice to him. He just didn't even have any of it.

176
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:13,460
Sometimes not just changing the mask. Gotta change clothes, too.

177
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:23,579
That would make sense. Another random encounter.

178
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:26,700
These guys don't care. I'm in bad sorts here. I took

179
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,299
a little jolt and have managed to get myself hopelessly lost.

180
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:34,779
I am staying in strawberry. If you could just guide me back.

181
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:40,869
You need to ride to strawberry. Okay. I think of a good reason to say no.

182
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:44,230
Lead the man to strawberry. Oh, thank you. Thank you, sir. You need a horse?

183
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:49,910
Well, after you. What possessed me to come out here, I'll never know.

184
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:55,450
Wait, I have to lead him? So this guy is just a guy following me now.

185
00:21:55,769 --> 00:22:02,359
I have a horse he can get on. Natural. I'm just visiting.

186
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:05,640
He can borrow it. I'm from New York City, actually.

187
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:10,519
You don't say? Oh, yes. There was some talk at the country club about this

188
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:12,920
burgeoning little resort town called strawberry.

189
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,480
So I thought it might be quite the trip to see what all the fuss was.

190
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,559
Just an escort mission. I have to make a few investments while it was still undervalued.

191
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:27,130
Turns out I was made the fool. It's a town of splinters.

192
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:30,809
If you could call it much of a town at all, I'd hardly stepped off the carriage

193
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:34,730
and I'd taken an old place. Should I get off the horse?

194
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:38,970
I suppose some might call it charming. Let me tell you,

195
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:42,569
charm is not worth much these days. You show me a timber frame, Jack,

196
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:48,549
and I'll show you Broadway. Meanwhile, you have this mayor, a

197
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:53,990
quite intolerable blowhard. He doesn't usually do that.

198
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:58,150
The man's completely deluded. Well, I should give him some credit.

199
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:01,509
He must be quite the salesman. He didn't get me out here after all.

200
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:04,710
More fool me. Now I'm tromping through the leaves and the muck was up.

201
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:10,180
This horse likes me. Cowboy. No offense.

202
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:14,410
This horse bonded me faster than anybody else.

203
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:17,930
Please kill this guy. Why? I have no reason to kill this guy yet.

204
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:22,549
For what reason? Look, I'm not just a maniac.

205
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:26,069
I don't kill people for no reason. There has to be a reason behind it

206
00:23:26,069 --> 00:23:36,359
every time. A lot of people coming out of here. I had no reason to kill the

207
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:41,750
map that he didn't give me when I asked it for.

208
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:47,109
What do you mean there wasn't a reason? I want your map. Give it to me.

209
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:51,450
I don't have anything. This guy's not going to hold out on me.

210
00:23:51,450 --> 00:24:03,019
He has a nice hat. I don't like that hat. I don't think it would look good on me.

211
00:24:03,019 --> 00:24:12,259
I don't think that hat would look good. He's got nice shoes.

212
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:16,980
Not nice enough. Why couldn't he just walk here by

213
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,539
himself? You seem quite the resourceful

214
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:22,660
sort, sir. I don't get it. If for some reason you couldn't just walk half a

215
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,460
mile. You may want to look into that

216
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:31,559
gabbing mayor. Something is definitely off with him.

217
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:35,779
Ask? Talk to the mayor. All right. Keep that in mind.

218
00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:43,000
Got some intel on the mayor. Maybe stay in town for now.

219
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,299
I've been to Hard Place. Thanks anyway. This looks like a Skyrim town. This

220
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:57,269
looks like the first Skyrim town. Is that all we done? I think that's

221
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:12,220
Yeah, this is the very first Skyrim town. I don't need to follow him still, but I'm

222
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:17,099
kind of... I just kind of want to hear his

223
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:23,720
whole story. Hey, this is the whole town. It's probably stable here.

224
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:30,900
It actually is. Press O. No. Somebody already got me with that. I do have

225
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,380
stuff to sell with Butcher. This guy's done.

226
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:43,180
Congratulations. You win. Let me sell some of this shit.

227
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:52,440
All right, we got, we got... Not bad. Big game meat. I'll sell it all. Maybe not

228
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,799
all of it, because I can cook this. Get rid of the shitty

229
00:25:55,799 --> 00:26:04,009
bird meat. Shitty rabbit pelt. Turkey feather. I'll keep the turkey

230
00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:11,349
feather. I'll keep like five turkey feathers.

231
00:26:11,349 --> 00:26:21,640
Big game meat. I need a stable. Is there a stable in this town?

232
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:34,789
There is no stable here. Well, that's just not good, is it?

233
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:42,099
Dammit. No stable? Well, here's one. A little outside of town. I was looking

234
00:26:42,099 --> 00:26:49,430
in the town. I was just looking. I'm sorry. I was

235
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:53,349
paying attention to this.

236
00:26:53,589 --> 00:27:02,460
Don't run him over, boys. What are you doing? Don't get up here.

237
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:07,369
I gotta talk to him like the freaks and geeks. Freak and weirdo.

238
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:32,359
To bring you the great news. The great news that you are saved today.

239
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:35,880
This even happens in that first level in Skyrim.

240
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:42,920
You guys are in the same spot. So we can spend eternity together.

241
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:50,859
They did. Hello, sir. Do you want to be saved?

242
00:27:50,859 --> 00:27:55,799
Sure. Yes, desperately. Well, that's

243
00:27:55,799 --> 00:28:04,440
wonderful news. You are. Come on. That's really all there is to it.

244
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,759
Just do more good things and less bad ones

245
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:13,160
and we can be together for all of eternity. What's wrong with this guy?

246
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:20,279
You and me. Am I gonna get married to these guys?

247
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:37,259
What? Great. Okay. I think that's all I can do with this guy.

248
00:28:37,339 --> 00:28:46,839
Married now. Appreciate a little more room here. Rejoice. Push him. No,

249
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:50,920
I can't. I just cleared all my bounties. It was so expensive.

250
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:56,940
Together we shall light up paradise with a whole

251
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:00,059
Wait, that's not the horse I want. That's a great light

252
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:07,819
that shines from within about the great glories of life. Yes,

253
00:29:07,819 --> 00:29:15,420
glories that I embody. You all thought I was gonna run right into him.

254
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:20,259
You thought I was gonna ram right into that guy, didn't you?

255
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:23,700
There's a time for living and there's a time

256
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:42,299
for dying and your time has come. Hey, I want a new horse. This one.

257
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:50,680
I'll stable you. Need a new name though, right?

258
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:55,400
All right, let's saddle this one up and I want to

259
00:29:55,400 --> 00:30:03,849
change the name. Horse care package. Let's rename the horse.

260
00:30:03,849 --> 00:30:07,769
What does the horse look like? We got like kind of navy blue.

261
00:30:07,769 --> 00:30:24,279
Could be old navy. Old navy. What the fuck are these suggestions?

262
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:27,960
Bean bag sonic? It can't be bean bag sonic. That's to be like a horse

263
00:30:27,960 --> 00:31:01,079
bag sonic. Why would it be bean bag? There. Okay. Upgrade. I got 320 bucks.

264
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:07,529
Let's see what's big. Saddles. What's on the back of sonic the hedgehog?

265
00:31:07,529 --> 00:31:14,700
Is it red? Red spikes? What? White? It's white, right? It's blue. It's just, is it

266
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:33,589
blue? All blue. That's pretty close. Okay.

267
00:31:33,589 --> 00:31:42,569
Got it on. I already own it. You have this item equipped already. Okay.

268
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:51,559
Saddle bags. Upgraded. Here's blue. 40 fucking dollars, man.

269
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:58,460
It's worth it. I know. That's what I just said.

270
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:06,740
Stirrups. Try to give them red shoes. I'll, I don't know if you can.

271
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:16,569
Corge rain rate. Bell stirrup. Any of these any better?

272
00:32:16,569 --> 00:32:20,619
I mean, I already have. The bell stirrup does a better job. Yeah, just put the bell one on.

273
00:32:20,619 --> 00:32:24,619
It's already equipped. Corge rain rate. It's higher, but

274
00:32:24,619 --> 00:32:34,980
that's fine. Horns. This is the, this is the joystick.

275
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:43,079
Sock puppet? I think I want the sock puppet.

276
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:51,539
Diablo. Hmm. Yeah. We're going with sock puppet.

277
00:32:51,539 --> 00:33:03,380
Blankets. I don't even need any of these. It's the one that I already have.

278
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:09,529
It's fine. Bedrolls. I don't think, can you do shoes?

279
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:15,240
No, this one's fine. All right. Grooming.

280
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:25,539
Main. We need long spikes. I mean, that's not even close. I get, that's

281
00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:33,690
as close as it's gonna be though. Yeah, it has to be the white ones.

282
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:50,230
What? You guys don't have mobile? Why are you saying that?

283
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:54,980
Does he, the Sonic doesn't have a tail. No, he just, he's just blue.

284
00:33:54,980 --> 00:34:00,460
That's fine. Okay, anything else that we can do?

285
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:03,420
No, I can't do anything with the shoes, right? Grooming. No.

286
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:08,550
Services. You could just do a care package.

287
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:15,289
Yeah, let's just like, let's care package to the horse. What's with the

288
00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:22,150
blue mohawk? Then it's like, what? Yeah, what's

289
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:28,170
up with that? That's weird. Okay. All right, here's

290
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:33,110
Horsebag Sonic. A little bit slower than, uh,

291
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:37,880
no, at the moment it's a little faster than Thunder. I mean, Whisper's just too

292
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,960
good, but that's, that's like kind of cheating.

293
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:46,900
This is the, this is the you spent $20 horse. No.

294
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:56,280
All right, let's go. That's not even a white main.

295
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:05,369
Oh, it's the wrong lighting. All right, let's see how fast you can go.

296
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:09,050
Pretty fast, actually. Pretty fast. Back to, okay,

297
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:20,900
Micah. We were trying to get to Micah. Come on. Micah.

298
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:34,309
Hold down P. What do you mean P? Crazy fool. See, that was pretty cool.

299
00:35:34,309 --> 00:35:47,260
All right, Micah. Time for a mission. Break Micah out of this prison, right?

300
00:35:47,260 --> 00:36:00,420
Micah. In here? Horse hybrid. Hello, sir. I've, uh, I've come from

301
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:05,139
Blackwater. I'm on the trail of a dangerous gang,

302
00:36:05,139 --> 00:36:08,659
Tomo Drisco. Heard you had some sort of incident.

303
00:36:08,659 --> 00:36:12,980
No deal with bounty hunters around here, son. I was just wondering if I could

304
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:17,559
get a description. Well, they weren't friends. They got

305
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:20,840
in a fight, two men got killed. Now one of them's an idiot, the other's

306
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:24,119
some kind of dumb mix, so maybe them's your boys.

307
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:28,519
Can I get my bounty back? I already paid for it.

308
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:37,059
Thank you, Sheriff. I do need another outfit. I've been doing this same

309
00:36:37,139 --> 00:36:46,360
outfit's been here for a while. Okay, locate and speak to Micah.

310
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:57,610
Do I have to sneak? Am I allowed back here? Arthur, Arthur.

311
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:01,769
Hello, old friend. Had a good time. Tagged on.

312
00:37:01,769 --> 00:37:06,380
You going to get me out of here? I ain't decided yet.

313
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:13,579
Real fucking- Am I clean shaded? I've lost her out of your mouth these

314
00:37:13,579 --> 00:37:18,630
last six months, and now the opportunity to watch you be

315
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:25,079
silent. Well, you gotta do something. I always looked up to you, Arthur.

316
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:31,860
You can pull this card. Listen, there's one little problem.

317
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:35,619
A town full of people wanting to see you swing.

318
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:47,400
You got to do something, Arthur. I do. So we have to find a way to free

319
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,739
Micah. Do I have to blow this building?

320
00:37:51,739 --> 00:38:07,130
All right, hold on. Stand back. This wall just needs some good force.

321
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:10,329
Might want to step back.

322
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,420
I did it. Let's get out of here. Come on.

323
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:23,719
What the fuck is this guy? He wasn't O'Driscoll. What?

324
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:31,900
It worked. I'm just standing right here.

325
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:54,219
Out. Just driving around. What am I doing, man? I just used them.

326
00:38:54,219 --> 00:39:01,320
Right? What the fuck would I do that for? There wasn't anybody- I just lit

327
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:08,969
another one. Throw it. Get it out of here quick. Get it out of here.

328
00:39:08,969 --> 00:39:20,969
Wait, no. Wrong button. Okay, those of you that need to know,

329
00:39:20,969 --> 00:39:27,690
if you press L2, it lights it. It lights it when you press L2.

330
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:37,269
Oh, fuck. Easy.

331
00:39:37,269 --> 00:39:51,349
I didn't know that when you press L2, it just lights it up.

332
00:39:51,349 --> 00:40:02,409
I got some deadeye here. Should I use it? Might as well. Was that just random

333
00:40:02,409 --> 00:40:09,050
person? That might have been just random.

334
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:12,570
I want to loot all these people so bad.

335
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:25,940
All right, back to the shotgun here.

336
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,639
I got that- wait, I got this guy? How did I get that guy?

337
00:40:35,639 --> 00:41:06,090
I think that camcorder fell down. I got cocaine?

338
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:30,199
All right, we don't need to clear this room. Do we need to clear the room?

339
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:34,579
Wanted. Slice. What the fuck is happening?

340
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:40,329
Oh my god, he just killed somebody in there.

341
00:41:40,969 --> 00:41:44,860
We're wanted right now, we gotta go.

342
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:13,940
Oh, on the top? Nope, we're good. Hold on, just wait, wait, wait, wait.

343
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:27,500
I want to pick it- just wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm gonna get at least like two

344
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:36,139
cigarettes off this guy. These are our horses. Nice. All right,

345
00:42:36,139 --> 00:42:46,619
let's go. Watch out, watch out, watch out.

346
00:42:46,619 --> 00:43:03,300
Okay, we're good. I can't shoot this guy. And I got off

347
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:06,820
the fucking horse. That's just wonderful, that wasn't it.

348
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:18,489
The horse is fucked up. The horse is injured. The horse is-

349
00:43:18,489 --> 00:43:22,809
I'm on a fucking bonko. I'm on a fucking bronco.

350
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:28,579
Oh Jesus. Wait, wait, the horse- my horse is hurt.

351
00:43:28,579 --> 00:43:42,710
I need to feed the horse. Drink this. Drink it. Drink. Have some.

352
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:58,300
Okay, you're good. That's a gun. Drink it.

353
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:03,579
No, I need something that's gonna refill your core here.

354
00:44:03,579 --> 00:44:09,579
More stamina, of course health. I need some cores here.

355
00:44:09,579 --> 00:44:25,139
There we go. Just eat it. There we go.

356
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,900
All right, we're good.

357
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:37,139
We have some gifted subs here from Kazzy, thank you Kazzy101.

358
00:44:37,139 --> 00:44:42,900
For your five gifted subs. Thanks a lot man.

359
00:44:43,219 --> 00:44:46,099
Thanks for your generosity.

360
00:44:47,849 --> 00:44:51,099
Lightning.

361
00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:04,920
I like the storm skyshift, it's pretty cool.

362
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:14,679
Kinda need to do this, right? With that stormy sky, looks good.

363
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,920
I think we finally lost them. I hope so.

364
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,760
I'm giving you a holster. My way of saying thank you.

365
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:28,519
And thank you. A holster? There I was having a dull day only for you.

366
00:45:28,519 --> 00:45:32,280
To liven it up by letting me help you shoot up half a town.

367
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,719
You're a funny fella, Arthur. Real funny.

368
00:45:35,719 --> 00:45:39,800
Why you act all sour all the time. Yeah well, you ain't funny at all. So why

369
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,440
you gotta act like the court jester? Right, listen.

370
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,360
I'm sorry, but we're family now. Arthur,

371
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:53,480
you and me. Son of a... I don't know about this guy. Makes us brothers.

372
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:59,239
Sometimes, brothers make mistakes. Now I'm heading back to my little camp

373
00:45:59,239 --> 00:46:02,760
where I'm back a strawberry. Come see me. Can you get struck by

374
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,679
lightning in Red Dead Redemption 2? You ain't heading back to Dutch? No.

375
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:10,199
That would be hysterical. I ain't seeing Dutch

376
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:16,010
till I can bring him a peace offering. No, you cannot.

377
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:25,619
Are you kidding me? I mean, are they trying to make this the best game ever?

378
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:29,639
You can now own the offhand holster. This allows you to carry two sidearms at

379
00:46:29,639 --> 00:46:35,699
once and dual wield them. Okay.

380
00:46:35,699 --> 00:46:40,280
How are we doing? Sawed-off shotgun. So this is

381
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:46,739
dual wield. Oh man, that's cool. What does aiming do then? Is it both

382
00:46:46,739 --> 00:46:54,340
of them at the same time? Committing serious crimes will cause

383
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:57,699
towns to go into lockdowns. This is shown by a red area in the pause

384
00:46:57,699 --> 00:47:04,760
map. So we killed everybody in this town so

385
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:10,550
we can no longer use this town. Hold on, wait, wait, wait. I have a

386
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:16,969
bounty in here? $85. Well, that wasn't even my fault.

387
00:47:16,969 --> 00:47:27,030
That's bullshit. Let's go. You dual wield.

388
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:44,119
Oh right, I forgot. I'm aiming the gun at people.

389
00:47:44,119 --> 00:47:51,139
That guy doesn't have a face anymore. You can't just do that. Well, I was

390
00:47:51,699 --> 00:47:56,579
checking the dual wield. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

391
00:47:56,579 --> 00:48:03,690
Stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop. You didn't see shit.

392
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:32,090
My aim is so bad. It kicked him off. Okay,

393
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:36,280
I gotta get out of here. I have to leave right now.

394
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:45,219
Horse revival. It's my horse now. Okay, you're fine. You're good.

395
00:48:45,219 --> 00:49:09,639
What kind of horse is it? Ooh, nice. Not bad.

396
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:47,320
Everyone told me the horse sucked. I looked over. I revived it and was like,

397
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:54,099
horse sucks, bad horse, shitty speed. I just, I was trying to get off of

398
00:49:54,099 --> 00:50:05,769
him. Sort of dealt by decision making. I

399
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:09,050
didn't, hey, he ran. I didn't. I just, I just got off of him.

400
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:21,940
All right. I just got off. That made me sad.

401
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:32,389
I'm sorry. No, you're not. I'm not gonna jump off.

402
00:50:32,389 --> 00:50:38,309
Just, I got a telephone pole. Can I get down there from here? No, I

403
00:50:38,309 --> 00:50:43,130
probably can't. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.

404
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:48,420
Hold on a second here. I think we may have found a little campsite.

405
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:59,099
Let's hitch the horse. Put some backpacks and everything. There's

406
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:02,949
probably something over here. This is why this game's so cool,

407
00:51:02,949 --> 00:51:05,269
because this is just random shit everywhere.

408
00:51:05,269 --> 00:51:11,530
It's gotta be something, right? All this stuff over here and there's not anything

409
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:19,849
here for me to take. This is really cool. Nothing? Yeah,

410
00:51:19,849 --> 00:51:22,730
there's a box right here. So I didn't show up when I walked into it

411
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:31,500
before. Apparently, I can't do anything with

412
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:57,750
this. No, I don't. I opened it up. All right. What's in it?

413
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:02,260
Stand on the other side. That doesn't matter. There's nothing in here.

414
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:22,730
There's clearly a fucking apple in here though, guys. I mean, for real.

415
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:35,079
No, crouch. I'm doing it. I broke somebody's lunchbox. Well, you

416
00:52:35,079 --> 00:52:40,699
shouldn't have left it there if you cared about it.

417
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:48,389
There's something over here. In the well. Let's go.

418
00:52:48,389 --> 00:52:51,349
Too blurry. Wait, I could actually go down this way, can I?

419
00:52:51,349 --> 00:52:57,980
Yeah, I can go down here. Why is this GPS telling me to go

420
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:10,099
this way? I definitely cannot make it down here.

421
00:53:10,099 --> 00:53:16,070
Thanks a lot, fucking Google Maps. We're both over here.

422
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:24,360
I think I can get down here. We made it. We're good.

423
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:29,559
It's all right. You're fine. You're fine. You're good. You're good.

424
00:53:29,559 --> 00:53:33,800
It's fine. Come on. How deep is this?

425
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:49,380
I gotta test the depth. It's pretty deep.

426
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:52,579
That's really deep. I don't know if it's gonna make it.

427
00:53:52,579 --> 00:54:13,449
See, look at how deep this is. You become blunted if you're seen in this area.

428
00:54:13,449 --> 00:54:20,170
I'm not going back there, am I? I mean, how...

429
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:23,449
This whole area is on lockdown. I can't even go over here.

430
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:32,920
Be careful. I gotta sneak around. The entire side of the map over here is

431
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:37,880
on lockdown. Holy shit. I just don't be seen by anybody

432
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:43,159
in the law. Dead Eye Core is empty.

433
00:54:43,159 --> 00:54:52,789
Oh, let's see. I can eat something, right? Let's drink some brandy.

434
00:54:52,789 --> 00:55:05,030
And let's also drink another one. Why not? Just gin. Yeah, drink some gin too.

435
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:10,460
All right, we're good. So I just need to sneak over here.

436
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:16,070
The person I need to talk to is right here.

437
00:55:22,139 --> 00:55:26,300
Oh, we're supposed to be over here. Look, I'm here, guys.

438
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:32,440
I made it. Sorry it took me so long. I was busy.

439
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:39,159
I ghost-rid a horse off a cliff. I killed a whole town worth of people.

440
00:55:45,239 --> 00:55:54,070
And that's where it's going to remain for now. I think he's bait.

441
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:57,590
Well, I want to trial him publicly. Gentlemen,

442
00:55:57,590 --> 00:56:01,670
Sean is being moved up the up. You're going to hear too. I started this

443
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:05,909
mission as well. I was drinking at a bar and

444
00:56:05,909 --> 00:56:10,469
punching people. Sorry. We need to rescue him now.

445
00:56:10,469 --> 00:56:17,349
Moose? Of course not. Ike's Skeletons, boys.

446
00:56:17,349 --> 00:56:21,800
I'm moving him to a camp nearby before handing him over to them.

447
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:27,880
One person thought that was me. So I guess we need to stop them before they

448
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:32,059
get to camp. Charles, why don't you head up on the

449
00:56:32,059 --> 00:56:35,659
north side and we'll head up on the other side of the valley and meet you.

450
00:56:35,659 --> 00:56:38,219
That way we have them in either direction.

451
00:56:38,219 --> 00:56:41,980
Javier, Josiah, come on. Let's go see.

452
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:51,460
Come on. You know, Ike. I was gonna throw dynamite down there, but that's too easy.

453
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:58,650
Angry. Sure. Rescue Sean and then we'll get ourselves lost good and proper.

454
00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:09,880
It's a big country. I hope so. Okay, get on your horse. So we got

455
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:16,789
Sonic, Tails, and Shadow.

456
00:57:16,789 --> 00:57:24,739
Find the boat. Let's do it. Let's see if we can track down this boat.

457
00:57:24,739 --> 00:57:30,019
Keep your eyes open. Knuckles is red. They got patrols out all over this area.

458
00:57:30,019 --> 00:57:35,860
Yes, south of the river West Elizabeth isn't a very welcoming place right now.

459
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:39,619
It's definitely as bad as we feared over here.

460
00:57:39,619 --> 00:57:43,539
I keep hearing about this woman, Heidi McCourt.

461
00:57:43,539 --> 00:57:48,889
Hold up here. Hold up. Reckon those might be our boys.

462
00:57:48,889 --> 00:57:52,949
All right gentlemen. Gotta intercept the boat.

463
00:57:52,949 --> 00:58:01,079
Nice and easy. Let's make sure it's him first before you go starting

464
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:05,340
another war. They're already looking at us.

465
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:09,980
Do you think they can see us? If they can, we're just three fellas out on

466
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:13,579
the trail. Act natural. We'll be fine.

467
00:58:13,579 --> 00:58:19,349
So, you've been gone for a while. Much as I love charging the law and

468
00:58:19,349 --> 00:58:24,070
sleeping in the dirt with you derelicts, I do have a lot of business to attend to.

469
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:32,760
This is never a straight road anywhere. Especially with you.

470
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,719
Nice guy. He's coming out of an old record player.

471
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:38,119
People to rob.

472
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:47,190
He hasn't stopped talking since we left you in Valentine.

473
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:50,949
Fog is riding my life. Cute, dear boy.

474
00:58:50,949 --> 00:58:58,090
Hey, cute. Have you ever heard of radio?

475
00:58:58,090 --> 00:59:03,750
No, I don't think so. Pick up the pace a bit.

476
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:06,150
Well, you're leading. All right, you want me to lead? Fine. Get out of the

477
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:07,989
way then. Apparently there's a camp somewhere

478
00:59:07,989 --> 00:59:14,460
around. bounty hunters and transfer before continuing out West.

479
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:17,820
He's turning back yelling at me to go faster.

480
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:34,260
You're the guy in the lead. I'm just kind of following the boat.

481
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:38,230
Cinematic mode. Let's just keep it in sight, right?

482
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:48,570
I don't really have any control here. Well, do I?

483
00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:53,130
They've stopped. All right, let's take a closer look.

484
00:59:53,130 --> 01:00:02,340
All right, the boat's stopped. This gentleman. So who are these bounty hunters?

485
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:06,659
There he is. I don't know too much about arch-skeletons, boys.

486
01:00:06,659 --> 01:00:12,300
They're a big crew, wild, built some reputation in the last year or two.

487
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:16,699
That looks like Sean to me. Certainly kicking up enough of a fuss.

488
01:00:16,699 --> 01:00:21,099
So they execute him out here? Yep, that's definitely Sean.

489
01:00:21,099 --> 01:00:26,219
Oh, they're giving him a decent kicking. Well, you can only imagine the

490
01:00:26,219 --> 01:00:30,889
shit he's been giving them. Oh yes, they're taking him up the

491
01:00:30,889 --> 01:00:36,150
canyon. Is it gallows up here or something?

492
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:42,230
Why am I... I thought that was somebody else that we didn't know.

493
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:45,829
That wasn't connected to us doing the same thing.

494
01:00:45,829 --> 01:01:10,070
Just waving at us. We're just tourists on either side of the attraction.

495
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:14,420
This is gonna be stealth mission, right? Turn up the volume?

496
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:21,590
How's that? Better? We should do this quietly if we can.

497
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:25,769
Leave it to me, gentlemen. I'll go around and create a distraction.

498
01:01:25,769 --> 01:01:29,449
Then you two sneak across and do the dirty on them.

499
01:01:29,449 --> 01:01:32,650
Okay? Distraction. Crouch down out of...

500
01:01:32,650 --> 01:01:36,630
All right, so give me my knife. Take out your knife.

501
01:01:36,630 --> 01:02:05,699
Wait. Okay, I have the knife out. It's TMS.

502
01:02:05,699 --> 01:02:16,119
You take the one and keep down. Slow down, slow up a little bit, man.

503
01:02:16,119 --> 01:02:19,880
Slow up a little bit. You're gonna do it before I get there. Dude, come on.

504
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:37,829
Let's get up there.

505
01:02:42,489 --> 01:02:46,710
Wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Cattleman revolver. I have one of those.

506
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:59,849
Never mind. I don't want that. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

507
01:02:59,849 --> 01:03:07,400
I don't have a horse. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Where'd they go?

508
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:14,869
Oh, wait. I'm in the water. I gotta go up this way. Hurry, hurry.

509
01:03:14,869 --> 01:03:21,139
I was too busy fucking looking at this loot.

510
01:03:21,139 --> 01:03:24,119
Halfway up the canyon to deal with.

511
01:03:24,119 --> 01:03:51,139
To clean this gun. Looks good, right? Come on. Take out the bounty hunters.

512
01:03:51,139 --> 01:03:53,860
Stealthy. No sound.

513
01:03:53,860 --> 01:04:05,110
To get back home again. Me neither. I get. Just travel.

514
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:07,929
What?

515
01:04:07,929 --> 01:04:08,730
There! Look out!

516
01:04:08,730 --> 01:05:15,980
They turned around like that. I have a plan, R.

517
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:24,619
Oh, man. He's dead. Oh, no. This guy.

518
01:05:24,619 --> 01:05:27,860
I see Charles up there.

519
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:54,409
Which one's Charles? I don't know which one's the bad guy. He's using the Lux.

520
01:05:59,849 --> 01:06:00,809
I just aimed at him and he died.

521
01:06:01,610 --> 01:06:07,980
Oh, good. Wouldn't go that far.

522
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:09,980
The camp's up this way. Come on.

523
01:06:11,579 --> 01:06:12,780
Truck guns. I have a bow.

524
01:06:13,579 --> 01:06:16,300
I'll take the left side, Charles. You go right, okay?

525
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:16,780
I guess.

526
01:06:18,489 --> 01:06:19,050
Follow him, boy.

527
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:20,969
Let's take these easy we putas.

528
01:06:20,969 --> 01:06:22,170
God damn army.

529
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:50,739
Oh, right in the throat. Oh, I only have one shot left.

530
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:52,420
This is fun to use, though.

531
01:06:53,219 --> 01:07:04,380
What the hell was that? Oh, I'm gonna die.

532
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:14,789
All right. Is that happening or am I crazy?

533
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:18,550
During the middle of a fight, does this happen automatically once I actually drink it?

534
01:07:20,789 --> 01:07:40,969
Let's get Sean.

535
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:43,210
I got my arrow back.

536
01:07:45,639 --> 01:07:47,559
Rescue Sean. What do you got down here?

537
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:51,880
Is this the button for healing items?

538
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:52,679
What are you doing?

539
01:07:52,679 --> 01:07:55,110
I'm trying to. There's so much stuff.

540
01:07:55,829 --> 01:07:58,309
Are you gonna get me down from here?

541
01:07:58,309 --> 01:07:59,110
Oh, right. Okay.

542
01:08:04,090 --> 01:08:04,650
Shoot, bro.

543
01:08:05,769 --> 01:08:07,530
No, I ain't doing that all over again.

544
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:15,739
You know, you're a lot less ugly from that other angle, Arthur.

545
01:08:15,739 --> 01:08:16,380
Come on.

546
01:08:17,989 --> 01:08:23,829
Do we get a hug, Arthur? A warm embrace for a lost brother now found.

547
01:08:24,630 --> 01:08:25,270
New character.

548
01:08:25,909 --> 01:08:29,829
You know, nothing means more to me than this gang, the bond we share.

549
01:08:29,829 --> 01:08:31,590
It's the most real thing to me.

550
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:34,149
I would kill for it, I would happily die for it.

551
01:08:34,149 --> 01:08:35,670
But in spite of all of that,

552
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:38,789
I would have easily left you here to rot if Charles hadn't stopped me.

553
01:08:38,789 --> 01:08:40,310
I don't believe a word of that, Arthur.

554
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:42,310
Get him out of here.

555
01:08:42,310 --> 01:08:44,069
You're a great man, Arthur Morgan.

556
01:08:44,069 --> 01:08:46,710
The kind of young whipper snapper I can really admire.

557
01:08:46,710 --> 01:08:48,310
Oh, shut up.

558
01:08:48,310 --> 01:08:49,909
Right. We should split up.

559
01:08:49,909 --> 01:08:51,829
Javier, will you escort Mr. McGuire back to camp?

560
01:08:51,829 --> 01:08:53,109
That was a trailer moment.

561
01:08:53,109 --> 01:08:55,029
Charles, best you ride separately.

562
01:08:55,029 --> 01:08:57,590
Be careful. There's patrols everywhere.

563
01:08:58,710 --> 01:08:59,829
What about you?

564
01:08:59,829 --> 01:09:01,430
I'm gonna see what's worth taking here.

565
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:03,590
I'll meet you back there as soon as I can.

566
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:04,090
All right.

567
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:06,060
Okay, come on.

568
01:09:06,859 --> 01:09:08,300
Have I got stories for you?

569
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:09,659
Yeah. I can't wait.

570
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:12,300
Well, imagine y'all missed me a lot.

571
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:13,340
But fear not.

572
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:15,260
The joy's back in your lives now.

573
01:09:20,550 --> 01:09:21,050
Bronze.

574
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:29,479
I'm getting hungry.

575
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:34,899
Actually, in human world hungry.

576
01:09:34,899 --> 01:09:35,939
Not in video game world.

577
01:09:41,739 --> 01:09:44,300
Again, let me, I want to make sure I reiterate this again.

578
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:47,979
Tonight, this is the, the suggestions of the,

579
01:09:47,979 --> 01:09:52,859
the green screen suggestion channel is going to be locked tonight.

580
01:09:53,659 --> 01:09:57,939
So if you have some, something great that you'd like me to see,

581
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:03,060
you got to get it there before like four hours from now.

582
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:08,100
How long?

583
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:08,819
Chest up here, maybe?

584
01:10:09,859 --> 01:10:10,500
What?

585
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:11,539
Crime reported.

586
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:17,819
What? Did somebody call the police?

587
01:10:17,819 --> 01:10:18,779
I don't understand.

588
01:10:18,779 --> 01:10:21,880
Where? Who reported the crime?

589
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:30,729
Nothing up here.

590
01:10:30,729 --> 01:10:31,770
Somebody's investigating.

591
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:32,729
I gotta go now.

592
01:10:33,529 --> 01:10:34,029
Get off.

593
01:10:34,489 --> 01:10:41,909
I ain't going that way.

594
01:10:42,630 --> 01:10:45,399
Is there a date for the green screen?

595
01:10:45,399 --> 01:10:46,520
There is not a date yet.

596
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:51,270
Are they gonna hit a bird in mid-air?

597
01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:51,909
That was weird.

598
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:57,000
The date is probably going to be this coming next weekend.

599
01:11:03,539 --> 01:11:04,979
All right, let's see.

600
01:11:04,979 --> 01:11:06,260
What do I want to do now?

601
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:10,039
What's this?

602
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:12,380
Trapper.

603
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,189
Okay.

604
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,239
This whole side of the map is in lockdown.

605
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:18,199
I have to go back over here.

606
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:21,130
I don't really have anything I can do.

607
01:11:21,130 --> 01:11:22,090
I gotta like go to bed.

608
01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:23,449
I'm gonna go back to my town here.

609
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:25,939
I'm gonna go to sleep.

610
01:11:31,819 --> 01:11:33,899
But yeah, I'm gonna hope for this coming weekend.

611
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:37,420
That should be, it should give me enough time to

612
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:41,020
to buy all the props, have the props all get shipped

613
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:43,960
to the necessary.

614
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:45,960
I think I need to, hold on.

615
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:52,939
I think I have an achievement or something I can do

616
01:11:52,939 --> 01:11:54,460
to shoot rabbits on horseback.

617
01:11:56,890 --> 01:11:58,409
I kind of lost my opportunity there, didn't I?

618
01:12:00,329 --> 01:12:01,050
Easy now.

619
01:12:02,739 --> 01:12:03,460
Maybe not.

620
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:10,100
I'm very smelly.

621
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:10,600
Yeah, I know.

622
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:21,510
Okay, doesn't, I don't think this is rabbits.

623
01:12:23,109 --> 01:12:23,989
What the hell were those?

624
01:12:29,619 --> 01:12:30,260
What is that?

625
01:12:32,819 --> 01:12:33,619
I'm dying.

626
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:35,770
No.

627
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:51,399
Yuck.

628
01:12:51,399 --> 01:12:56,630
He did the voice.

629
01:12:58,899 --> 01:12:59,399
And yeah.

630
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:05,000
Wait, what?

631
01:13:05,619 --> 01:13:09,659
One of those is a raccoon?

632
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:14,539
Oh wait, how is one of those?

633
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:20,520
Okay.

634
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:22,220
I guess.

635
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:26,060
Any more?

636
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:27,560
I need rabbits.

637
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:30,279
Oh well.

638
01:13:30,279 --> 01:13:31,609
Let's take a look.

639
01:13:31,609 --> 01:13:32,010
What do I got?

640
01:13:32,970 --> 01:13:35,770
Challenges.

641
01:13:35,770 --> 01:13:36,489
Find a treasure.

642
01:13:37,289 --> 01:13:38,649
Win blackjack five times.

643
01:13:40,569 --> 01:13:41,289
Eat.

644
01:13:41,289 --> 01:13:42,329
Throw different berries.

645
01:13:42,329 --> 01:13:42,890
Yeah.

646
01:13:42,890 --> 01:13:44,810
If I could just kill two more rabbits on horseback.

647
01:13:45,449 --> 01:13:49,880
Good luck finding a rabbit.

648
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:56,420
Rabbits in this game are just everywhere.

649
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:58,899
But never when you want them to be around.

650
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,000
What is that down there?

651
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:08,520
What is that?

652
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:13,060
There's something up here.

653
01:14:14,579 --> 01:14:26,619
What is that?

654
01:14:26,619 --> 01:14:36,039
Oh, it's a skunk.

655
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:40,539
Hold on, wait, wait, wait.

656
01:14:40,539 --> 01:14:41,819
Can you just spray my skunk?

657
01:14:42,619 --> 01:14:48,199
This is a, it's poor.

658
01:14:49,079 --> 01:14:53,460
All right, let's track the skunk.

659
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:58,789
Can I get sprayed?

660
01:14:59,430 --> 01:15:00,869
I kind of want to just get sprayed.

661
01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:08,350
Come here.

662
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:10,649
Come here, spray me.

663
01:15:11,289 --> 01:15:15,380
Why are you so, you're so slow.

664
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:17,500
Come here.

665
01:15:18,199 --> 01:15:26,550
I don't know.

666
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:27,750
I'm not going to kick a skunk.

667
01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:28,550
They're so cute.

668
01:15:32,329 --> 01:15:32,970
I'm not, no.

669
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:34,409
It's not going to spray me.

670
01:15:34,409 --> 01:15:35,130
It doesn't spray me.

671
01:15:38,010 --> 01:15:39,289
I can't do that to a skunk.

672
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:42,939
Go live a very healthy life.

673
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:47,060
For at least the next like 11 months.

674
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:48,180
Because that's how long you live.

675
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:49,380
And that's just sad.

676
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:52,250
All right, come back here.

677
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:55,670
Corner it.

678
01:15:56,649 --> 01:15:57,609
I don't think I can.

679
01:15:57,609 --> 01:15:58,569
It's open field.

680
01:16:02,149 --> 01:16:03,350
I can't, what is it going to do?

681
01:16:10,039 --> 01:16:10,920
Throw a punch at it.

682
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:12,039
Well, what if I just go like this?

683
01:16:22,810 --> 01:16:23,310
Spray me.

684
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:25,380
Spray me in the face.

685
01:16:27,369 --> 01:16:27,869
Do it.

686
01:16:28,409 --> 01:16:33,939
I don't think it's going to happen.

687
01:16:33,939 --> 01:16:36,789
I need to get a skunk fact?

688
01:16:37,350 --> 01:16:42,189
Oh well.

689
01:16:42,649 --> 01:16:43,149
I tried.

690
01:16:47,539 --> 01:16:48,340
All right, back to camp.

691
01:16:51,270 --> 01:16:52,229
Run a little over the car.

692
01:16:55,939 --> 01:16:56,439
Turkeys.

693
01:16:57,220 --> 01:16:57,720
Turkeys.

694
01:17:08,550 --> 01:17:09,189
Did he just die?

695
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:10,619
Where is he?

696
01:17:10,619 --> 01:17:11,500
Is he hiding in the bush?

697
01:17:18,539 --> 01:17:20,300
All right, so let's see if the turkey will spray me in the face.

698
01:17:24,579 --> 01:17:25,779
He just face planted.

699
01:17:29,210 --> 01:17:31,050
No, I don't, I don't want to hole in that one.

700
01:17:31,050 --> 01:17:31,550
Let's go.

701
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:37,500
Can you lasso a turkey?

702
01:17:44,699 --> 01:17:45,819
That's not going to work, right?

703
01:17:51,369 --> 01:17:52,250
Where the hell did he go?

704
01:18:16,149 --> 01:18:17,989
He's just in circles.

705
01:18:17,989 --> 01:18:18,710
Where did he go?

706
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:23,579
Where the fuck is he?

707
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:28,550
I don't see a turkey.

708
01:18:33,619 --> 01:18:34,119
Whatever.

709
01:18:34,739 --> 01:18:35,300
I'm going to go.

710
01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:39,750
That was full-on.

711
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:41,430
It's like mouth into tree.

712
01:18:47,930 --> 01:18:49,979
This got outspotted by a turkey.

713
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:53,260
Hold on, wait, wait, wait.

714
01:18:53,260 --> 01:18:54,060
Speaking of animals.

715
01:18:54,699 --> 01:18:59,939
We got hay.

716
01:19:13,239 --> 01:19:13,880
Pet the horse.

717
01:19:17,159 --> 01:19:18,199
Okay, civilization.

718
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,460
Hey, partner.

719
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:24,220
Head still rolling from the road.

720
01:19:41,939 --> 01:19:42,979
Oh, wait, wait.

721
01:19:42,979 --> 01:19:43,939
He doesn't have any weapons.

722
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:45,619
I'm just kidding.

723
01:19:45,619 --> 01:19:46,100
It was a joke.

724
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:46,979
Here, take your horse back.

725
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:51,420
Stop.

726
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:52,060
Take the horse back.

727
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:52,619
I was kidding.

728
01:19:53,779 --> 01:19:54,500
Hey, come here.

729
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:56,279
Come here.

730
01:19:58,090 --> 01:19:59,850
It was, I was making a joke.

731
01:20:01,779 --> 01:20:02,279
Whoa.

732
01:20:35,060 --> 01:20:38,010
Where's his hat?

733
01:20:40,869 --> 01:20:41,670
No, no, no, no, no.

734
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:42,170
Give me that back.

735
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:57,050
Psycho laugh.

736
01:21:06,579 --> 01:21:07,140
Good joke.

737
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:09,220
I wasn't, I wasn't really trying to make a joke in his

738
01:21:10,970 --> 01:21:11,770
jump to his horse.

739
01:21:12,569 --> 01:21:14,310
And then he got mad.

740
01:21:14,310 --> 01:21:15,270
Bro, why, why would he?

741
01:21:24,390 --> 01:21:25,029
Hey, nice hat.

742
01:21:25,029 --> 01:21:25,590
Where'd you get it?

743
01:21:26,310 --> 01:21:26,869
I found it.

744
01:21:39,989 --> 01:21:40,630
Who got Bill?

745
01:21:48,310 --> 01:21:49,109
I'm coming with you, man.

746
01:21:49,909 --> 01:21:50,789
Let's take care of this.

747
01:21:51,989 --> 01:21:53,189
Let me maintain this gun, though.

748
01:21:53,829 --> 01:21:54,390
How is it?

749
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:55,189
You coming?

750
01:21:55,189 --> 01:21:56,149
No, I don't need to do that.

751
01:21:57,350 --> 01:21:57,829
Yeah, I'm coming.

752
01:21:57,829 --> 01:21:58,390
Let's go.

753
01:21:58,390 --> 01:21:59,189
All right.

754
01:21:59,189 --> 01:21:59,989
Lead the way.

755
01:21:59,989 --> 01:22:01,189
Is it going to be a devil cross?

756
01:22:01,189 --> 01:22:02,229
It better not be.

757
01:22:02,229 --> 01:22:03,750
So how'd you find him?

758
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:05,189
He said he was going hunting.

759
01:22:05,989 --> 01:22:06,789
Never returned.

760
01:22:07,430 --> 01:22:11,239
Was able to track him pretty easily.

761
01:22:12,649 --> 01:22:15,850
Only a matter of time before they decide to pick up camp.

762
01:22:15,850 --> 01:22:16,649
Ahead for town.

763
01:22:16,649 --> 01:22:17,529
That's really cool.

764
01:22:17,529 --> 01:22:18,569
The mission can come to you.

765
01:22:19,850 --> 01:22:20,649
That's pretty interesting.

766
01:22:21,850 --> 01:22:22,569
Fair point.

767
01:22:23,689 --> 01:22:25,100
Is this random?

768
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:26,300
It might, it might be.

769
01:22:27,020 --> 01:22:28,300
I thought he was just going to run to the tree.

770
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:33,100
He's a problem.

771
01:22:33,739 --> 01:22:34,539
We all know it.

772
01:22:36,149 --> 01:22:37,510
I need some cores here.

773
01:22:37,510 --> 01:22:39,210
Hold on.

774
01:22:39,210 --> 01:22:40,649
I need health and deadeye.

775
01:22:41,609 --> 01:22:51,109
If I have anything, they can do that for me.

776
01:22:51,109 --> 01:22:51,350
I think it is.

777
01:22:58,569 --> 01:23:07,180
That's okay.

778
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:07,659
That's good enough.

779
01:23:07,659 --> 01:23:11,260
I really probably should just refill the deadeye, but whatever.

780
01:23:12,140 --> 01:23:17,560
Okay.

781
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:19,159
Okay, we're getting close.

782
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:21,659
A rescue Bill.

783
01:23:23,109 --> 01:23:24,149
There they are.

784
01:23:24,149 --> 01:23:25,590
On foot from here.

785
01:23:25,590 --> 01:23:29,140
Any more arrows?

786
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:32,020
Um, sawed off shotgun.

787
01:23:35,380 --> 01:23:36,899
Double barreled pump action.

788
01:23:37,939 --> 01:23:39,539
I think I'm going to use the repeater here.

789
01:23:39,539 --> 01:23:40,979
Let's take out your position.

790
01:23:41,939 --> 01:23:43,050
How does this thing look?

791
01:23:44,090 --> 01:23:46,500
We could use a cleaning.

792
01:23:47,539 --> 01:23:54,170
All right, we're good.

793
01:23:54,729 --> 01:23:55,850
It's in pretty decent condition.

794
01:23:56,729 --> 01:24:00,779
So we're going to stake this out.

795
01:24:00,779 --> 01:24:02,619
So Bill is over here capturing.

796
01:24:02,619 --> 01:24:03,579
Anyone you are, Arthur?

797
01:24:04,949 --> 01:24:10,729
I don't know where he is.

798
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:19,720
Actually, I might be able to get him.

799
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:22,039
All with one deadeye here.

800
01:24:22,039 --> 01:24:22,359
Let's see.

801
01:24:22,359 --> 01:24:22,680
Hold on.

802
01:24:28,539 --> 01:24:29,100
Is that Dutch?

803
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:48,359
None of you guys are the guy I'm supposed to be expecting.

804
01:24:49,829 --> 01:24:50,470
Look at that horse.

805
01:24:50,470 --> 01:24:51,750
Look at that horse.

806
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:52,310
Look at that horse.

807
01:24:53,189 --> 01:24:54,550
Look at that fucking horse.

808
01:24:54,550 --> 01:24:55,189
Come here, you.

809
01:24:55,189 --> 01:24:56,390
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

810
01:24:56,390 --> 01:24:56,869
Come here.

811
01:24:56,869 --> 01:24:57,670
Look at you.

812
01:24:57,670 --> 01:24:58,149
You're huge.

813
01:24:58,710 --> 01:24:59,430
No, get out of the way.

814
01:25:02,619 --> 01:25:03,260
The horse.

815
01:25:03,260 --> 01:25:05,899
Hey, I need to...

816
01:25:06,619 --> 01:25:07,989
Whose horse?

817
01:25:08,710 --> 01:25:09,909
Oh, it's Bill's horse.

818
01:25:11,029 --> 01:25:17,109
I was going to say, damn, man.

819
01:25:17,109 --> 01:25:17,909
Can I have that?

820
01:25:24,710 --> 01:25:25,590
Take Bill's shit.

821
01:25:39,050 --> 01:25:42,810
Arthur, when are they going to learn?

822
01:25:44,329 --> 01:25:46,170
I can't make him have an accident.

823
01:25:47,770 --> 01:25:48,250
All right.

824
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:49,770
Well, I should be getting on.

825
01:25:50,489 --> 01:25:51,609
All right, Morgan.

826
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:52,890
That's it.

827
01:25:52,890 --> 01:25:54,010
That horse is crazy.

828
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:56,439
Well, whatever.

829
01:25:56,439 --> 01:25:57,399
That was cool.

830
01:25:57,399 --> 01:25:58,520
A little random encounter.

831
01:25:59,239 --> 01:26:01,479
I think I've looted everybody except for these guys over here.

832
01:26:05,539 --> 01:26:06,420
Don't leave just yet.

833
01:26:06,979 --> 01:26:08,899
What about crates and shit?

834
01:26:08,899 --> 01:26:11,140
Boxes hanging up here?

835
01:26:11,939 --> 01:26:13,539
I don't think so.

836
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:22,619
I don't see anything.

837
01:26:25,449 --> 01:26:26,090
There's a hat.

838
01:26:26,649 --> 01:26:27,529
Ah, ah, ah.

839
01:26:27,529 --> 01:26:28,329
There it is.

840
01:26:29,850 --> 01:26:30,329
Right here.

841
01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:33,579
What?

842
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:42,140
There is a lot of stuff.

843
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:44,939
No, I can't take any more brandy or biscuits.

844
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:51,479
What am I going to do?

845
01:26:51,479 --> 01:26:52,119
Get out of here.

846
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:53,800
I'm finally blocked in.

847
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:03,539
Money?

848
01:27:03,539 --> 01:27:04,500
There is money in here.

849
01:27:05,140 --> 01:27:08,409
That's a dollar.

850
01:27:09,369 --> 01:27:16,460
One dollar in your chest of stuff.

851
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:21,979
Might as well use it to cook.

852
01:27:22,619 --> 01:27:28,340
So big game.

853
01:27:28,899 --> 01:27:29,699
Playing big game.

854
01:27:30,659 --> 01:27:32,260
That's really good.

855
01:27:33,539 --> 01:27:37,140
Cook one, eat it, and then store three of them.

856
01:27:37,140 --> 01:27:47,670
We're full on all the cores.

857
01:27:47,670 --> 01:27:48,310
Make another one.

858
01:27:48,949 --> 01:27:54,680
Cook the baked beans?

859
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:56,279
Can you do that?

860
01:27:57,159 --> 01:28:04,260
I'm getting hungry.

861
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:05,380
I'm getting really hungry.

862
01:28:12,789 --> 01:28:14,069
Something more important, though.

863
01:28:17,109 --> 01:28:19,930
The internet's been fine, right?

864
01:28:20,729 --> 01:28:26,060
This is pretty promising stuff.

865
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:30,779
6,000 up the whole time.

866
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:36,939
I have 23 drop frames in four hours and 30 minutes before that.

867
01:28:36,939 --> 01:28:39,260
How long is the first stream before I accidentally was an idiot?

868
01:28:42,180 --> 01:28:43,380
An hour and 10 minutes or something?

869
01:28:49,220 --> 01:28:51,300
When will I do 1080p streams?

870
01:28:52,489 --> 01:28:55,850
Now that is going to take probably a little bit longer

871
01:28:56,489 --> 01:29:00,199
because I'm going to need a full streaming PC to do that.

872
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:08,710
1080p 60 FPS is, I guess, obviously the grand of all potential streams.

873
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:17,930
The only thing with that, though, is did they ever fix the whole thing with...

874
01:29:18,890 --> 01:29:25,130
I remember hearing about how, oh, yeah, if you have like an 8,000 up 1080p stream,

875
01:29:25,130 --> 01:29:28,010
a shitload of people can't even watch it because it'll buffer out the whole time.

876
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:30,569
Does that still happen?

877
01:29:30,569 --> 01:29:31,930
Is that a problem that's been fixed?

878
01:29:34,779 --> 01:29:35,739
That was a problem before.

879
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:41,800
Even putting the stream on low, it brings it down to a point where you still can't even see it.

880
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:52,890
1080p 30?

881
01:29:52,890 --> 01:29:53,369
Yeah, you can do that.

882
01:29:53,369 --> 01:29:53,930
I can do that, too.

883
01:29:55,130 --> 01:29:56,310
I just don't...

884
01:29:56,310 --> 01:29:57,510
I'm not sure because I have...

885
01:29:58,630 --> 01:30:00,890
I'd have to do a little bit of research on 1080p,

886
01:30:02,170 --> 01:30:03,289
mainly because it's a...

887
01:30:04,979 --> 01:30:05,939
This computer is...

888
01:30:05,939 --> 01:30:07,859
I got a six-core processor.

889
01:30:08,739 --> 01:30:10,409
Here we go.

890
01:30:10,409 --> 01:30:11,050
Let's go right here.

891
01:30:11,770 --> 01:30:16,539
I have a six-core processor, so I could probably handle it,

892
01:30:16,539 --> 01:30:18,380
but I don't know if I could do it on every game.

893
01:30:28,649 --> 01:30:29,149
Great.

894
01:30:35,239 --> 01:30:36,550
Another psycho.

895
01:30:44,039 --> 01:30:45,399
You care about this girl?

896
01:30:46,119 --> 01:30:47,720
Stand up for yourself.

897
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:48,600
She'll come around.

898
01:30:49,319 --> 01:30:51,319
Yeah, I've been waiting.

899
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:02,060
Trust me, kid.

900
01:31:02,859 --> 01:31:05,260
There ain't so many good men out there.

901
01:31:05,899 --> 01:31:07,979
Make yourself one of the good ones.

902
01:31:08,779 --> 01:31:09,579
Thanks, mister.

903
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:11,260
I hope you're right.

904
01:31:11,260 --> 01:31:12,619
I got points.

905
01:31:17,779 --> 01:31:18,819
You have a great day.

906
01:31:18,819 --> 01:31:19,699
I hope you're doing all right.

907
01:31:21,539 --> 01:31:22,500
Bullet to his head.

908
01:31:27,319 --> 01:31:27,960
Wait, don't move.

909
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:36,619
Can he hit me in the head with a rock?

910
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:41,500
Are you scared of what?

911
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:42,300
I was going to hunt those.

912
01:31:44,939 --> 01:31:45,819
He's still talking.

913
01:31:45,819 --> 01:31:47,180
He still has a bullet on the radar.

914
01:32:05,939 --> 01:32:08,739
Waste away like some fallen leaf.

915
01:32:08,739 --> 01:32:10,659
I kind of want to listen to this guy's whole dialogue.

916
01:32:10,659 --> 01:32:11,539
Wouldn't that be nice?

917
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:21,560
Come on.

918
01:32:23,020 --> 01:32:24,619
Can't move around here all day.

919
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:32,180
Come on.

920
01:32:32,180 --> 01:32:32,739
Where does he go?

921
01:32:48,569 --> 01:32:49,449
He looks so odd.

922
01:33:01,939 --> 01:33:02,739
I was trying to talk to him.

923
01:33:11,689 --> 01:33:13,289
Just Superman punch him?

924
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:15,560
I can't.

925
01:33:16,739 --> 01:33:18,100
Guys, we're evil.

926
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:21,300
We're only evil when it's a random act of evil.

927
01:33:21,859 --> 01:33:23,140
You know, if somebody stops in the road

928
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:24,180
and they're like, who the fuck are you?

929
01:33:24,180 --> 01:33:25,140
And I'm like, who the fuck are you?

930
01:33:25,220 --> 01:33:25,699
You're not.

931
01:33:28,539 --> 01:33:30,060
I'm not just going to murder this guy.

932
01:33:33,180 --> 01:33:33,659
Wait, I can't.

933
01:33:33,659 --> 01:33:34,619
I have to like...

934
01:33:34,619 --> 01:33:35,420
Okay.

935
01:33:35,420 --> 01:33:35,899
See you.

936
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:37,579
There we go.

937
01:33:38,869 --> 01:33:40,229
I can't be in cinematic cam, dude.

938
01:33:40,229 --> 01:33:41,189
Like, say hello to the guy.

939
01:33:54,489 --> 01:33:54,970
Not much.

940
01:33:55,529 --> 01:33:56,010
Let me be.

941
01:33:58,859 --> 01:34:00,380
This guy's not happy with me right now.

942
01:34:00,380 --> 01:34:01,020
I got to stay back.

943
01:34:01,899 --> 01:34:11,750
I got to keep a distance where I'm not following him.

944
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:15,560
Tay, it's right here.

945
01:34:16,279 --> 01:34:18,520
This is the distance that I'm legally allowed to be behind him.

946
01:34:19,239 --> 01:34:22,119
Before he gets upset about it.

947
01:34:35,939 --> 01:34:36,899
Restraining order?

948
01:34:36,899 --> 01:34:37,380
No, no.

949
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:39,380
I'm just saying like in the video game world.

950
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:41,739
Rabbits!

951
01:34:41,739 --> 01:34:42,140
Rabbits!

952
01:34:42,699 --> 01:34:55,029
Who's just screaming?

953
01:34:55,670 --> 01:34:57,939
Did you hear that?

954
01:35:05,420 --> 01:35:06,619
He just fucking screamed.

955
01:35:11,819 --> 01:35:13,819
Is this guy going to walk all the way back to my camp?

956
01:35:17,020 --> 01:35:17,579
Just go?

957
01:35:17,579 --> 01:35:17,979
I know.

958
01:35:17,979 --> 01:35:19,739
I need to know where this guy's going.

959
01:35:21,930 --> 01:35:22,810
Here are your choices.

960
01:35:23,619 --> 01:35:23,939
Okay.

961
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:25,859
Follow this guy and see where he goes.

962
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:28,100
Or shotgun to his head.

963
01:35:28,659 --> 01:35:29,619
That's like...

964
01:35:29,619 --> 01:35:30,659
Those are the two options.

965
01:35:37,510 --> 01:35:38,229
See?

966
01:35:38,229 --> 01:35:38,630
Follow.

967
01:35:39,189 --> 01:35:42,619
I don't have an off switch.

968
01:35:42,619 --> 01:35:43,500
I don't have an in-between.

969
01:35:45,829 --> 01:35:48,390
It's one or one hundred.

970
01:35:49,029 --> 01:35:57,029
What if he leads me to something?

971
01:35:57,029 --> 01:36:01,899
But not zero.

972
01:36:01,899 --> 01:36:02,539
No, never zero.

973
01:36:02,539 --> 01:36:03,739
Why would you ever give zero percent?

974
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:09,930
That's a good thing.

975
01:36:10,569 --> 01:36:11,289
Who is this?

976
01:36:11,289 --> 01:36:12,649
Horsebag Sonic.

977
01:36:12,649 --> 01:36:13,689
Right, that's what your name is.

978
01:36:16,489 --> 01:36:17,289
Partner?

979
01:36:17,289 --> 01:36:17,689
Hello?

980
01:36:20,489 --> 01:36:22,810
Might as well be friendly, I say.

981
01:36:24,250 --> 01:36:26,899
I've been following him for so long.

982
01:36:27,859 --> 01:36:28,579
All the best.

983
01:36:30,359 --> 01:36:38,250
This is a nice walk, though.

984
01:36:38,250 --> 01:36:39,289
Nice and misty up here.

985
01:36:40,090 --> 01:36:42,779
Look at this.

986
01:36:42,779 --> 01:36:43,420
This is great.

987
01:36:44,220 --> 01:36:48,630
I mean, technically I am going in the right direction, so...

988
01:36:55,909 --> 01:37:03,079
It's getting kind of bad out right now.

989
01:37:03,079 --> 01:37:04,119
This is not getting good.

990
01:37:04,119 --> 01:37:04,680
This is...

991
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:06,199
The weather's getting a little treacherous.

992
01:37:14,279 --> 01:37:14,680
Hey.

993
01:37:14,680 --> 01:37:15,399
Hey, mister.

994
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:24,100
Walking home in the rain.

995
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:24,340
Yep.

996
01:37:24,979 --> 01:37:32,970
I feel like we're playing an old Recess game.

997
01:37:33,689 --> 01:37:34,970
It's like Red Light Green Light.

998
01:37:43,369 --> 01:37:44,329
This feels illegal.

999
01:37:44,329 --> 01:37:45,130
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1000
01:37:45,130 --> 01:37:45,449
I'm sorry.

1001
01:37:45,449 --> 01:37:45,850
I'm sorry.

1002
01:37:47,829 --> 01:37:48,390
No.

1003
01:37:48,390 --> 01:37:48,789
No, okay.

1004
01:37:50,569 --> 01:37:54,899
What?

1005
01:37:54,899 --> 01:37:56,579
Oh no, another random person!

1006
01:37:57,140 --> 01:37:57,380
No!

1007
01:37:59,270 --> 01:38:00,149
No, no, no!

1008
01:38:00,149 --> 01:38:01,270
Don't do this to me now!

1009
01:38:01,270 --> 01:38:01,770
Please!

1010
01:38:05,050 --> 01:38:05,550
No!

1011
01:38:06,649 --> 01:38:08,329
If you could help me with these shackles,

1012
01:38:08,329 --> 01:38:11,289
I just might have a chance.

1013
01:38:11,289 --> 01:38:11,789
Oh!

1014
01:38:12,569 --> 01:38:13,609
Okay, quickly, quickly, quickly.

1015
01:38:13,609 --> 01:38:14,810
How did you end up like this?

1016
01:38:14,810 --> 01:38:15,289
Quickly, quickly.

1017
01:38:15,289 --> 01:38:16,970
Just shoot the damn chains already.

1018
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:19,699
Come on!

1019
01:38:19,699 --> 01:38:22,380
All right.

1020
01:38:22,380 --> 01:38:23,020
Oh.

1021
01:38:23,020 --> 01:38:23,899
Oh, yes.

1022
01:38:23,899 --> 01:38:24,619
He's running!

1023
01:38:24,619 --> 01:38:25,119
Yes.

1024
01:38:25,739 --> 01:38:26,300
Perfect.

1025
01:38:39,159 --> 01:38:40,119
He's still talking.

1026
01:38:40,119 --> 01:38:47,270
Don't let him get away.

1027
01:38:47,270 --> 01:38:47,989
Robbery tip?

1028
01:38:53,909 --> 01:38:54,229
Horse?

1029
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:56,140
What is that?

1030
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:00,939
Is that the same guy?

1031
01:39:01,579 --> 01:39:03,100
I don't even think that's the same guy.

1032
01:39:03,739 --> 01:39:05,100
I think this is a different person.

1033
01:39:05,739 --> 01:39:17,739
I'm gonna run out of juice here.

1034
01:39:18,380 --> 01:39:24,899
Where do you go?

1035
01:39:24,899 --> 01:39:25,699
Where, where, where, where, where?

1036
01:39:26,260 --> 01:39:27,640
What is this?

1037
01:39:28,779 --> 01:39:29,260
What happened?

1038
01:39:29,899 --> 01:39:31,029
Somebody find him.

1039
01:39:31,029 --> 01:39:31,670
Somebody point him out.

1040
01:39:31,670 --> 01:39:32,149
Point him out!

1041
01:39:45,340 --> 01:39:45,739
Where is he?

1042
01:39:45,739 --> 01:39:46,539
Where'd he go?

1043
01:39:46,539 --> 01:39:50,520
Give me the fucking horse.

1044
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:51,159
Get on the horse.

1045
01:39:51,159 --> 01:39:51,960
Where the fuck were you?

1046
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:54,869
Where the fuck were you, buddy?

1047
01:39:55,510 --> 01:39:57,609
Took you long enough.

1048
01:39:58,810 --> 01:39:59,289
Where is he?

1049
01:40:21,369 --> 01:40:21,850
Found him.

1050
01:40:21,850 --> 01:40:22,090
No.

1051
01:40:22,090 --> 01:40:27,420
That's not him.

1052
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:28,060
God damn it.

1053
01:40:28,859 --> 01:40:45,510
Oh well.

1054
01:40:45,510 --> 01:40:48,039
Congrats on a waste of time.

1055
01:40:48,039 --> 01:40:48,359
I know.

1056
01:40:50,489 --> 01:40:51,130
Honest to God.

1057
01:40:51,770 --> 01:40:57,399
Who are you?

1058
01:40:57,399 --> 01:41:01,750
Hey.

1059
01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:03,189
Hey, Wallace.

1060
01:41:03,189 --> 01:41:05,590
This here's the kind soul I was telling you about.

1061
01:41:05,590 --> 01:41:08,310
The one that got the venom out of your leg.

1062
01:41:08,310 --> 01:41:10,470
Oh, it's the, it's the venom guy.

1063
01:41:10,470 --> 01:41:16,489
I know I can never repay you, but you head over to gunsmith

1064
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:21,850
and pick out your choice of item on my tab.

1065
01:41:23,939 --> 01:41:24,500
Thanks.

1066
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:26,420
Yeah, it seemed like the least I could do

1067
01:41:27,060 --> 01:41:30,659
with him being sent straight from the almighty to save my life.

1068
01:41:30,659 --> 01:41:33,060
Yeah, the almighty.

1069
01:41:33,060 --> 01:41:34,420
Always a doubter you are.

1070
01:41:35,060 --> 01:41:36,420
I'm a man of this world.

1071
01:41:36,420 --> 01:41:38,100
You guys told me to shoot him in the head.

1072
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:38,500
Anyway.

1073
01:41:39,619 --> 01:41:40,420
Free item.

1074
01:41:40,420 --> 01:41:40,979
Anything?

1075
01:41:40,979 --> 01:41:42,100
I could take any gun for free.

1076
01:41:44,329 --> 01:41:45,689
What can I do for you?

1077
01:41:45,689 --> 01:41:49,689
Fitter outside told me I could grab something on his tab.

1078
01:41:49,689 --> 01:41:51,609
One with the bite in his leg.

1079
01:41:51,609 --> 01:41:55,180
Oh, he's good for it.

1080
01:41:55,180 --> 01:41:57,739
But all he's good for between the two of us.

1081
01:41:57,739 --> 01:41:59,100
Well, take a look around.

1082
01:41:59,100 --> 01:42:00,060
Find something you like.

1083
01:42:00,060 --> 01:42:01,340
Now put it on his tab.

1084
01:42:01,340 --> 01:42:01,739
What?

1085
01:42:01,739 --> 01:42:02,939
Any gun in the whole game?

1086
01:42:02,939 --> 01:42:03,819
In the whole catalog?

1087
01:42:04,859 --> 01:42:07,770
Hold on a second here.

1088
01:42:07,770 --> 01:42:08,250
Rifles.

1089
01:42:12,649 --> 01:42:13,609
72 bucks.

1090
01:42:13,609 --> 01:42:14,890
145 bucks.

1091
01:42:17,350 --> 01:42:18,310
180 bucks.

1092
01:42:18,310 --> 01:42:19,189
120 bucks.

1093
01:42:19,909 --> 01:42:24,359
These are locked though, unfortunately.

1094
01:42:25,609 --> 01:42:29,159
85, 95, 148.

1095
01:42:32,180 --> 01:42:33,619
One free gun.

1096
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:35,140
Oh, dude.

1097
01:42:37,050 --> 01:42:38,250
I got a pistol cartridge.

1098
01:42:38,250 --> 01:42:39,210
It was $1.50.

1099
01:42:41,449 --> 01:42:42,090
Now it's zero.

1100
01:42:45,060 --> 01:42:47,479
All right.

1101
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:50,760
I gotta calm down here.

1102
01:42:51,319 --> 01:42:53,720
Just give me the most expensive gun in the whole catalog that I can buy.

1103
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:59,529
Do I get to save this or do I have to do it right now?

1104
01:43:07,579 --> 01:43:09,100
This pump action, I already own it.

1105
01:43:10,329 --> 01:43:11,289
I already own this one.

1106
01:43:15,720 --> 01:43:17,159
I can't even buy these because they're locked.

1107
01:43:18,409 --> 01:43:21,130
Well, this Springfield rifle is 120 bucks.

1108
01:43:21,130 --> 01:43:21,770
I don't have this.

1109
01:43:22,489 --> 01:43:27,560
Varmint rifle 72.

1110
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:29,880
I need one of these to get clean kills on it and some animals.

1111
01:43:35,699 --> 01:43:38,579
Master Mauser pistol 250.

1112
01:43:38,579 --> 01:43:39,140
210.

1113
01:43:41,510 --> 01:43:44,229
150 bucks for the Volcanic pistol.

1114
01:43:47,109 --> 01:43:50,840
Schofield 84.

1115
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:51,319
Volcanic.

1116
01:43:51,319 --> 01:43:52,680
Why is Volcanic so much more expensive?

1117
01:43:53,399 --> 01:43:58,420
I think I'm going for Volcanic.

1118
01:43:58,420 --> 01:43:58,659
Yeah.

1119
01:43:59,619 --> 01:44:08,039
The most explosive pistol ever.

1120
01:44:09,899 --> 01:44:10,539
Schofield?

1121
01:44:14,869 --> 01:44:15,430
Volcanic.

1122
01:44:15,430 --> 01:44:15,829
Shit.

1123
01:44:15,829 --> 01:44:16,869
Springfield.

1124
01:44:16,869 --> 01:44:17,590
Not Volcanic.

1125
01:44:22,710 --> 01:44:25,590
I mean, it's either Schofield.

1126
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:29,239
Or the Springfield rifle.

1127
01:44:31,300 --> 01:44:32,819
120 versus 84.

1128
01:44:32,819 --> 01:44:33,539
I'm probably going to get it.

1129
01:44:33,539 --> 01:44:34,500
I need a good rifle.

1130
01:44:35,060 --> 01:44:39,270
Modern Firefire, these Firefields.

1131
01:44:39,270 --> 01:44:40,310
Is it single shot or what?

1132
01:44:40,949 --> 01:44:49,319
Yeah, the rifle that I have is kind of junk.

1133
01:44:50,119 --> 01:44:51,159
Yeah, I'm going to get it.

1134
01:44:51,159 --> 01:44:51,800
Single shot.

1135
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:52,520
Okay, that's fine.

1136
01:44:53,939 --> 01:44:54,899
You can't aim.

1137
01:44:54,899 --> 01:44:55,380
I'll learn.

1138
01:44:56,260 --> 01:45:02,170
You get Volcanic for free anyways.

1139
01:45:02,170 --> 01:45:03,850
Well, this one's 120 bucks.

1140
01:45:03,850 --> 01:45:05,130
The other one's 80.

1141
01:45:05,130 --> 01:45:06,170
But more bang for buck.

1142
01:45:06,890 --> 01:45:08,380
I'm getting it.

1143
01:45:08,380 --> 01:45:09,500
Fine choice.

1144
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:10,779
I'll let them know.

1145
01:45:10,939 --> 01:45:12,220
And then we're going to deck it out.

1146
01:45:14,569 --> 01:45:15,130
Components.

1147
01:45:15,850 --> 01:45:16,890
Hey, the thing was for free.

1148
01:45:16,890 --> 01:45:17,850
Might as well deck it out.

1149
01:45:19,340 --> 01:45:19,739
Rifling.

1150
01:45:19,739 --> 01:45:21,819
Customize groove to improve stability.

1151
01:45:22,619 --> 01:45:23,739
More range on it.

1152
01:45:24,779 --> 01:45:25,020
Yeah.

1153
01:45:26,060 --> 01:45:28,859
Okay.

1154
01:45:31,189 --> 01:45:31,909
Iron sights.

1155
01:45:32,710 --> 01:45:33,510
Improved sights.

1156
01:45:34,310 --> 01:45:35,739
This shit's $5.

1157
01:45:35,739 --> 01:45:36,460
I got it for free.

1158
01:45:37,659 --> 01:45:42,149
You can put a scope on it.

1159
01:45:42,149 --> 01:45:42,949
Medium scope.

1160
01:45:43,590 --> 01:45:45,670
Well, that kind of defeats the iron sights then, doesn't it?

1161
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:48,199
Let's put a fucking scope on it.

1162
01:45:50,739 --> 01:45:51,460
Screw it, man.

1163
01:45:51,460 --> 01:45:52,020
Let's do it.

1164
01:45:52,659 --> 01:45:57,399
Straight grain.

1165
01:45:58,119 --> 01:45:59,239
Wide grain.

1166
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:01,640
Basic grain.

1167
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:03,640
I like the straight grain.

1168
01:46:04,199 --> 01:46:09,399
And let's get a wrap here.

1169
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:11,609
I do not know.

1170
01:46:12,970 --> 01:46:13,930
It helps from wear and tear.

1171
01:46:16,010 --> 01:46:17,430
I got a trophy.

1172
01:46:18,069 --> 01:46:19,659
Okay.

1173
01:46:20,300 --> 01:46:23,609
All right.

1174
01:46:23,609 --> 01:46:24,170
Styles.

1175
01:46:25,350 --> 01:46:25,750
Metals.

1176
01:46:26,470 --> 01:46:28,680
This is the barrel.

1177
01:46:32,939 --> 01:46:33,260
Gold?

1178
01:46:35,260 --> 01:46:35,579
Blue?

1179
01:46:40,699 --> 01:46:44,020
Frame.

1180
01:46:44,659 --> 01:46:45,380
To the whole thing.

1181
01:46:45,380 --> 01:46:46,659
Oh, that looks nice.

1182
01:46:47,859 --> 01:46:49,619
I kind of like the muted gold here.

1183
01:46:49,619 --> 01:46:50,100
I don't...

1184
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:50,260
Yeah.

1185
01:46:50,260 --> 01:46:51,220
We're going with...

1186
01:46:51,220 --> 01:46:52,100
We're going with brass.

1187
01:46:53,779 --> 01:46:57,180
What's about the hammer here?

1188
01:47:02,039 --> 01:47:02,439
Brass.

1189
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:07,880
The sight can be...

1190
01:47:12,149 --> 01:47:12,630
Brass.

1191
01:47:13,510 --> 01:47:14,869
It's just a brass.

1192
01:47:15,670 --> 01:47:16,229
Okay.

1193
01:47:16,229 --> 01:47:19,430
At what point am I just making like a fucking tuba?

1194
01:47:19,430 --> 01:47:20,149
You know what I'm saying?

1195
01:47:20,149 --> 01:47:22,550
Like, I'm turning this into a French horn.

1196
01:47:24,149 --> 01:47:27,909
If I blow in the end of this, it's going to make fucking musical sounds.

1197
01:47:27,909 --> 01:47:32,979
All right.

1198
01:47:32,979 --> 01:47:34,579
We're going to go just straight up steel here.

1199
01:47:37,689 --> 01:47:41,180
Ooh, baby.

1200
01:47:42,180 --> 01:47:42,979
Full engraving.

1201
01:47:43,539 --> 01:47:46,039
Can't really even see that.

1202
01:47:51,380 --> 01:47:52,979
That's 28 bucks.

1203
01:47:53,539 --> 01:47:55,510
Engrave the barrel?

1204
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:57,079
No.

1205
01:47:57,079 --> 01:47:58,680
Engrave the frame, though.

1206
01:47:58,680 --> 01:47:59,079
No.

1207
01:47:59,079 --> 01:47:59,720
Trap door.

1208
01:48:00,520 --> 01:48:01,640
You can't even see this shit.

1209
01:48:04,310 --> 01:48:05,029
Carvings.

1210
01:48:05,029 --> 01:48:05,350
Grip.

1211
01:48:07,109 --> 01:48:08,229
Oh, man.

1212
01:48:08,229 --> 01:48:09,829
This thing is going to be nice.

1213
01:48:09,829 --> 01:48:10,630
I like the eagle.

1214
01:48:13,140 --> 01:48:13,380
Hmm.

1215
01:48:14,420 --> 01:48:15,859
Now, the question is which eagle?

1216
01:48:15,859 --> 01:48:19,939
Are we talking just straight up like back of the coin eagle?

1217
01:48:19,939 --> 01:48:21,380
Are we talking mid-flight eagle?

1218
01:48:22,020 --> 01:48:27,579
I think I like the commemorative gold coin eagle that's on the infomercial.

1219
01:48:34,949 --> 01:48:36,869
Ah, it's ruined.

1220
01:48:38,020 --> 01:48:40,020
It's being covered up by the thing to protect it.

1221
01:48:42,729 --> 01:48:43,369
Leather.

1222
01:48:43,369 --> 01:48:48,539
I like that.

1223
01:48:49,340 --> 01:48:50,300
I like the chocolate.

1224
01:48:52,020 --> 01:48:52,979
Chocolate looks pretty good.

1225
01:48:55,189 --> 01:48:55,989
Olive, maybe?

1226
01:48:57,430 --> 01:49:01,180
Tobacco.

1227
01:49:01,739 --> 01:49:11,659
Let's get a good varnish on it.

1228
01:49:12,220 --> 01:49:15,300
Oh, this is the piece that sells it.

1229
01:49:15,300 --> 01:49:15,779
You know what I'm saying?

1230
01:49:16,579 --> 01:49:20,840
That looks kind of good.

1231
01:49:21,779 --> 01:49:22,739
Dark walnut.

1232
01:49:25,260 --> 01:49:25,899
There it is.

1233
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:30,100
That's the fucking desk I have right now.

1234
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:33,960
Dark walnut.

1235
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:36,890
Can I see a better image of this?

1236
01:49:37,529 --> 01:49:42,630
Yeah, I have to do it.

1237
01:49:42,630 --> 01:49:43,270
This is my desk.

1238
01:49:43,909 --> 01:49:45,560
Did that just say desk?

1239
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:47,079
Oh, desk walnut.

1240
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:53,619
Dark walnut.

1241
01:49:53,619 --> 01:49:54,420
Look at that.

1242
01:49:54,420 --> 01:49:56,420
Look at that desk that shoots bullets.

1243
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:01,529
Ammunition.

1244
01:50:01,529 --> 01:50:02,810
What kind of ammunition?

1245
01:50:02,810 --> 01:50:03,289
Rifle.

1246
01:50:03,289 --> 01:50:04,329
Express 30.

1247
01:50:05,130 --> 01:50:07,930
Regular express or high velocity.

1248
01:50:08,489 --> 01:50:10,500
This one's more damage.

1249
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:11,380
This one's more range.

1250
01:50:20,470 --> 01:50:21,750
Range or damage?

1251
01:50:23,260 --> 01:50:24,859
The never-ending conundrum.

1252
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:30,140
There's already a lot of damage range.

1253
01:50:31,420 --> 01:50:36,090
I guess I can get them both, huh?

1254
01:50:36,090 --> 01:50:38,460
Well, that was a lot of money.

1255
01:50:39,100 --> 01:50:39,899
Three.

1256
01:50:39,899 --> 01:50:47,510
How much did I just spend?

1257
01:50:47,510 --> 01:50:48,550
What?

1258
01:50:48,550 --> 01:50:49,270
I'm a moron?

1259
01:50:49,270 --> 01:50:49,510
Why?

1260
01:50:50,069 --> 01:50:52,869
I just bought high velocity.

1261
01:50:53,670 --> 01:50:55,420
That's $12.

1262
01:50:55,420 --> 01:50:55,979
That's nothing.

1263
01:50:55,979 --> 01:50:56,460
That's fine.

1264
01:50:58,840 --> 01:51:00,920
So I can switch between ammos, right?

1265
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:02,119
I can just get them both.

1266
01:51:11,529 --> 01:51:13,930
I'm going to use the shitty ammo to learn.

1267
01:51:20,819 --> 01:51:22,340
I have every fucking ammo now.

1268
01:51:27,670 --> 01:51:28,550
Take off the scope.

1269
01:51:29,350 --> 01:51:30,229
Why would I do that?

1270
01:51:31,510 --> 01:51:34,229
Why would I get rid of my tuba horn gun desk?

1271
01:51:34,229 --> 01:51:34,869
Are you serious?

1272
01:51:35,750 --> 01:51:36,470
No.

1273
01:51:36,470 --> 01:51:45,850
This thing's ready to go.

1274
01:51:46,729 --> 01:51:49,380
Let's take a look.

1275
01:51:49,380 --> 01:51:50,100
Let's check it out.

1276
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:54,979
Look at that.

1277
01:51:56,140 --> 01:51:56,779
Oh, man.

1278
01:51:56,779 --> 01:51:57,500
Does that look good?

1279
01:51:58,220 --> 01:52:02,810
So what is it?

1280
01:52:02,810 --> 01:52:03,609
Let's go to the...

1281
01:52:03,609 --> 01:52:05,479
I can't even open it.

1282
01:52:05,479 --> 01:52:06,760
Nice free gun.

1283
01:52:06,760 --> 01:52:08,119
Yeah, don't you just stand there until they get you.

1284
01:52:09,380 --> 01:52:12,420
The gun is free and then you spend $400 on components.

1285
01:52:13,300 --> 01:52:17,159
This gun is just a mobile game.

1286
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:20,470
How's it treating you?

1287
01:52:20,470 --> 01:52:21,100
All right.

1288
01:52:21,100 --> 01:52:23,180
I need to get to like a little range here to aim it.

1289
01:52:25,050 --> 01:52:25,930
Go show the guy.

1290
01:52:26,649 --> 01:52:27,529
That's not a bad idea.

1291
01:52:28,409 --> 01:52:34,460
Where is he?

1292
01:52:34,460 --> 01:52:35,180
Is he still here?

1293
01:52:35,180 --> 01:52:35,819
There he is.

1294
01:52:35,819 --> 01:52:36,220
Hey, man.

1295
01:52:37,260 --> 01:52:37,739
What do you think?

1296
01:52:38,300 --> 01:52:39,899
I'll let the clerk know.

1297
01:52:39,899 --> 01:52:40,619
Thanks again.

1298
01:52:41,260 --> 01:52:41,579
Sure.

1299
01:52:42,300 --> 01:52:47,260
This is the best stranger in the game.

1300
01:52:48,060 --> 01:52:49,640
Can I sit next to him?

1301
01:52:50,279 --> 01:52:57,930
Yeah.

1302
01:52:57,930 --> 01:52:59,850
You think you can fuck with the desk trombone?

1303
01:53:00,569 --> 01:53:01,289
Thanks a lot, dude.

1304
01:53:10,020 --> 01:53:11,859
I want to test it out, but I can't open...

1305
01:53:11,859 --> 01:53:13,699
I can't take the gun out right now.

1306
01:53:13,699 --> 01:53:14,979
I have to go somewhere safe.

1307
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:21,720
Snipe him from a distance.

1308
01:53:25,720 --> 01:53:26,840
Thanks for the new gun.

1309
01:53:26,840 --> 01:53:27,880
Let me try it out.

1310
01:53:34,979 --> 01:53:35,300
No.

1311
01:53:36,100 --> 01:53:36,819
I can't.

1312
01:53:37,380 --> 01:53:38,100
I can't.

1313
01:53:39,619 --> 01:53:40,819
That's too awful.

1314
01:53:41,859 --> 01:53:42,340
Where is it?

1315
01:53:42,340 --> 01:53:43,699
Where's the gun store from here?

1316
01:53:44,180 --> 01:53:46,180
I'm aiming.

1317
01:53:46,180 --> 01:53:46,659
It's right.

1318
01:53:46,659 --> 01:53:47,619
I got to go around.

1319
01:53:48,420 --> 01:53:51,340
Let me line him up.

1320
01:53:51,340 --> 01:53:52,300
God damn it.

1321
01:53:53,020 --> 01:53:59,210
He's right there.

1322
01:53:59,210 --> 01:53:59,689
Okay.

1323
01:53:59,689 --> 01:54:01,369
Let me get this straight.

1324
01:54:01,369 --> 01:54:04,699
I'm going to go up here.

1325
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:08,710
He's the best...

1326
01:54:08,710 --> 01:54:10,310
I just want to see if I can do it.

1327
01:54:11,029 --> 01:54:12,710
I just want to see how long the scope is.

1328
01:54:13,590 --> 01:54:26,970
How do I change the bullet?

1329
01:54:26,970 --> 01:54:29,960
High velocity.

1330
01:54:29,960 --> 01:54:31,020
Okay.

1331
01:54:31,020 --> 01:54:31,659
Here we go.

1332
01:54:31,659 --> 01:54:34,920
How do I go into scope mode?

1333
01:54:34,920 --> 01:54:35,319
There we go.

1334
01:54:35,960 --> 01:54:45,930
That's not very far.

1335
01:54:53,260 --> 01:54:53,899
I can't.

1336
01:54:54,699 --> 01:54:56,060
I can't do it, guys.

1337
01:54:56,859 --> 01:54:57,899
I can't do it.

1338
01:54:57,899 --> 01:54:59,100
That's not nice.

1339
01:54:59,100 --> 01:55:00,380
You gave me a free gun.

1340
01:55:00,380 --> 01:55:00,619
What?

1341
01:55:00,619 --> 01:55:01,899
Do you think I'm going to shoot him?

1342
01:55:05,210 --> 01:55:06,250
I can't do this.

1343
01:55:06,970 --> 01:55:11,500
What if he gives me another free gun in like an hour?

1344
01:55:11,500 --> 01:55:14,489
And there's no saving.

1345
01:55:14,489 --> 01:55:15,609
I can't just save it.

1346
01:55:16,250 --> 01:55:24,779
Look, this guy didn't give me a gun.

1347
01:55:24,779 --> 01:55:25,819
We can test it on him.

1348
01:55:39,619 --> 01:55:40,180
I missed him.

1349
01:55:47,510 --> 01:55:49,449
Just imagine that guy.

1350
01:55:56,489 --> 01:55:56,890
Okay.

1351
01:55:56,890 --> 01:55:59,449
The guy that gave me the gun, right?

1352
01:55:59,449 --> 01:56:00,090
I go out and I'm like,

1353
01:56:00,090 --> 01:56:01,289
Hey, what do you think?

1354
01:56:01,289 --> 01:56:02,090
Oh, that's great.

1355
01:56:02,090 --> 01:56:02,329
Yeah.

1356
01:56:02,329 --> 01:56:03,210
Put it on my tab.

1357
01:56:04,260 --> 01:56:05,779
Like four minutes later.

1358
01:56:05,779 --> 01:56:06,579
It's just quiet.

1359
01:56:06,579 --> 01:56:07,380
All of a sudden.

1360
01:56:07,380 --> 01:56:11,220
Oh, a long scope shot dings off the back of somebody's carriage.

1361
01:56:11,220 --> 01:56:12,500
You're standing right there.

1362
01:56:14,869 --> 01:56:16,149
No crime committed.

1363
01:56:16,149 --> 01:56:20,229
I'm fine.

1364
01:56:20,229 --> 01:56:22,390
Oh, that's so fucking stupid.

1365
01:56:23,670 --> 01:56:24,630
Nobody's looking for me.

1366
01:56:24,630 --> 01:56:25,590
Oh, sorry, man.

1367
01:56:25,590 --> 01:56:26,149
I shot.

1368
01:56:26,149 --> 01:56:28,630
I shot a gun into a guy's fucking carriage.

1369
01:56:35,579 --> 01:56:37,100
You see me just like,

1370
01:56:37,100 --> 01:56:37,500
Oh, shit.

1371
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:38,699
I got to get out of here.

1372
01:56:38,779 --> 01:56:39,979
Run off in the distance.

1373
01:56:44,100 --> 01:56:45,619
I fucking missed.

1374
01:56:45,619 --> 01:56:45,859
All right.

1375
01:56:45,859 --> 01:56:46,659
Let's go to church.

1376
01:56:55,100 --> 01:56:55,739
The same guy.

1377
01:56:55,739 --> 01:56:56,300
You turn around.

1378
01:56:56,300 --> 01:56:57,020
He looks to his right.

1379
01:56:57,020 --> 01:56:58,539
He sees a guy going to church now.

1380
01:57:00,140 --> 01:57:00,859
Oh, man.

1381
01:57:02,539 --> 01:57:04,760
God, somebody needs help.

1382
01:57:04,760 --> 01:57:05,079
Hold on.

1383
01:57:08,649 --> 01:57:09,369
Who?

1384
01:57:09,369 --> 01:57:13,060
Who needs help?

1385
01:57:13,699 --> 01:57:15,819
I don't.

1386
01:57:15,819 --> 01:57:16,060
Who?

1387
01:57:16,060 --> 01:57:16,380
I don't.

1388
01:57:16,380 --> 01:57:17,420
Who needs help?

1389
01:57:17,420 --> 01:57:21,800
I don't see anybody.

1390
01:57:21,800 --> 01:57:25,430
Okay.

1391
01:57:28,220 --> 01:57:31,399
Um, I don't see anybody.

1392
01:57:31,399 --> 01:57:32,199
So let's go to church.

1393
01:57:35,029 --> 01:57:35,270
Whoa.

1394
01:57:37,859 --> 01:57:38,180
Okay.

1395
01:57:39,859 --> 01:57:47,140
Where is this guy?

1396
01:57:51,289 --> 01:57:52,939
Oh, it's you.

1397
01:57:52,939 --> 01:57:53,180
Okay.

1398
01:58:08,420 --> 01:58:08,979
Yeah, whatever.

1399
01:58:08,979 --> 01:58:09,460
That's fine.

1400
01:58:15,300 --> 01:58:16,739
Just going to pretend to be a guy's friend.

1401
01:58:21,369 --> 01:58:21,930
Honor money.

1402
01:58:22,569 --> 01:58:23,770
Last friend died.

1403
01:58:24,890 --> 01:58:25,689
It weren't my fault.

1404
01:58:26,569 --> 01:58:27,449
They said it was,

1405
01:58:28,090 --> 01:58:29,449
but they was wrong.

1406
01:58:31,239 --> 01:58:32,680
It's fun being with you, Mister.

1407
01:58:34,119 --> 01:58:35,560
Can I hold you a second, Mister?

1408
01:58:36,729 --> 01:58:37,130
Can I?

1409
01:58:39,079 --> 01:58:39,880
Yeah, sure.

1410
01:58:39,880 --> 01:58:40,920
How goes things with you?

1411
01:58:43,779 --> 01:58:44,739
Okay, just...

1412
01:58:44,739 --> 01:58:45,539
I'm so dirty.

1413
01:58:48,789 --> 01:58:51,079
That felt...

1414
01:58:51,079 --> 01:58:52,680
It's nice to be held sometimes.

1415
01:58:52,680 --> 01:58:53,479
Honor money.

1416
01:58:53,479 --> 01:58:55,319
Oh, we used to hold each other in the war.

1417
01:58:56,539 --> 01:58:58,060
You got sad eyes, Mister.

1418
01:58:58,060 --> 01:58:59,100
You look like a ghoul.

1419
01:58:59,100 --> 01:58:59,819
Like you've seen.

1420
01:59:00,539 --> 01:59:01,579
Sad things.

1421
01:59:02,779 --> 01:59:05,880
Remember with kindness.

1422
01:59:05,880 --> 01:59:09,670
This guy's going to come back at some point.

1423
01:59:10,710 --> 01:59:19,369
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1424
01:59:19,369 --> 01:59:20,729
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1425
01:59:20,729 --> 01:59:21,449
Hey, whoa!

1426
01:59:21,449 --> 01:59:22,649
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1427
01:59:23,529 --> 01:59:26,010
Hey, excuse me.

1428
01:59:26,649 --> 01:59:27,289
Where's my gun?

1429
01:59:27,289 --> 01:59:27,770
Where's my gun?

1430
01:59:27,770 --> 01:59:28,329
Where's my gun?

1431
01:59:29,050 --> 01:59:30,390
Where's my gun?

1432
01:59:32,090 --> 01:59:32,810
Where's my gun?

1433
01:59:38,630 --> 01:59:39,670
Give me my gun back.

1434
01:59:39,670 --> 01:59:41,750
I spent so much time getting it.

1435
01:59:41,750 --> 01:59:42,470
Give me the gun.

1436
01:59:43,350 --> 01:59:44,859
Give me my gun, please.

1437
01:59:45,500 --> 01:59:47,180
I spent so much time getting that gun.

1438
01:59:49,579 --> 01:59:50,460
Give me my gun back.

1439
01:59:51,180 --> 01:59:52,710
Give me my gun.

1440
01:59:53,430 --> 01:59:55,130
Where's my gun?

1441
01:59:59,159 --> 02:00:03,539
Where's my gun?

1442
02:00:05,180 --> 02:00:05,819
Wait, what?

1443
02:00:06,779 --> 02:00:07,100
What?

1444
02:00:07,899 --> 02:00:08,380
What?

1445
02:00:08,939 --> 02:00:09,659
What?

1446
02:00:09,659 --> 02:00:09,979
What?

1447
02:00:11,500 --> 02:00:11,819
What?

1448
02:00:12,460 --> 02:00:14,060
No, what?

1449
02:00:14,060 --> 02:00:15,979
It's all the same.

1450
02:00:15,979 --> 02:00:17,899
Oh, oh boy.

1451
02:00:17,899 --> 02:00:19,819
Oh, oh boy.

1452
02:00:24,630 --> 02:00:25,909
Get me out of here.

1453
02:00:25,909 --> 02:00:27,270
Get me out of here.

1454
02:00:27,270 --> 02:00:28,569
Don't even want me.

1455
02:00:29,449 --> 02:00:32,840
This is in pain.

1456
02:00:33,800 --> 02:00:35,399
I thought everyone told me he robbed me.

1457
02:00:35,399 --> 02:00:36,279
I thought he robbed me.

1458
02:00:36,279 --> 02:00:37,399
I didn't have the gun on me.

1459
02:00:37,399 --> 02:00:38,600
I thought I had the gun on me.

1460
02:00:39,399 --> 02:00:45,609
I thought he stole my rifle.

1461
02:00:45,609 --> 02:00:46,649
I thought he stole it.

1462
02:00:48,890 --> 02:00:49,770
Easy, girl.

1463
02:00:49,770 --> 02:00:50,329
Easy.

1464
02:00:51,130 --> 02:00:57,659
Okay, I got it.

1465
02:00:57,659 --> 02:00:59,979
I got it.

1466
02:01:23,260 --> 02:01:29,000
I gotta get out of here, dude.

1467
02:01:32,260 --> 02:01:33,699
I have to leave now.

1468
02:01:33,699 --> 02:01:34,420
I gotta get out of here.

1469
02:01:34,420 --> 02:01:35,060
I'm gonna die.

1470
02:01:40,329 --> 02:01:42,729
I can't.

1471
02:01:46,600 --> 02:01:47,079
Get up.

1472
02:01:47,079 --> 02:01:47,479
Get up.

1473
02:01:48,039 --> 02:01:48,520
Get up.

1474
02:01:49,670 --> 02:01:50,229
Get up.

1475
02:01:54,180 --> 02:01:54,819
Ow.

1476
02:01:54,819 --> 02:01:55,539
Ow.

1477
02:01:55,539 --> 02:01:56,819
Oh my god.

1478
02:01:56,819 --> 02:01:57,779
Oh, my stomach.

1479
02:01:59,779 --> 02:02:01,300
No, get me out of here.

1480
02:02:02,579 --> 02:02:04,579
Please get me out of here.

1481
02:02:04,579 --> 02:02:10,890
This game is fucking so much fun.

1482
02:02:13,859 --> 02:02:17,189
Nice sniper role.

1483
02:02:20,149 --> 02:02:20,630
Reload.

1484
02:02:21,270 --> 02:02:25,930
I'll be so far behind.

1485
02:02:27,579 --> 02:02:39,050
Open this.

1486
02:02:40,250 --> 02:02:45,770
I just like, come on.

1487
02:02:46,489 --> 02:02:47,529
Give me some slack here.

1488
02:02:47,529 --> 02:02:49,689
Give me at least a little bit of slack here.

1489
02:02:49,689 --> 02:02:52,649
That was like a random, oh, hey, give me a hug.

1490
02:02:52,649 --> 02:02:55,050
And then like, I'm missing my expensive rifle.

1491
02:02:55,609 --> 02:02:58,090
I had to put two and two together.

1492
02:02:58,090 --> 02:02:58,970
I didn't want to lose it.

1493
02:02:58,970 --> 02:03:00,090
That was expensive.

1494
02:03:04,630 --> 02:03:06,550
And then I looked over at chat and everyone's just like,

1495
02:03:07,109 --> 02:03:08,229
dude, no, he took it.

1496
02:03:08,229 --> 02:03:09,350
He fucking stole it, man.

1497
02:03:09,350 --> 02:03:10,470
That NPC steals it.

1498
02:03:10,470 --> 02:03:11,270
I'm just like, god.

1499
02:03:13,029 --> 02:03:13,590
Oh, god.

1500
02:03:14,470 --> 02:03:15,189
I was like, god.

1501
02:03:15,189 --> 02:03:16,069
And you guys were like, whoa.

1502
02:03:16,069 --> 02:03:16,869
And I was like, god.

1503
02:03:17,829 --> 02:03:18,710
Nice explanation.

1504
02:03:23,689 --> 02:03:25,770
I punched him in the head with the gun and I shot him in the head.

1505
02:03:30,869 --> 02:03:32,789
That was not supposed to happen.

1506
02:03:32,789 --> 02:03:34,729
It wasn't supposed to be like that.

1507
02:03:35,689 --> 02:03:42,020
So I got one arm.

1508
02:03:43,619 --> 02:03:48,920
All right.

1509
02:03:48,920 --> 02:03:50,819
I don't want to work my horse here.

1510
02:03:53,350 --> 02:03:53,750
Slow down.

1511
02:03:53,750 --> 02:03:54,229
Let's eat.

1512
02:03:56,680 --> 02:03:57,399
Reload this.

1513
02:03:57,399 --> 02:03:58,359
I can't.

1514
02:03:58,359 --> 02:03:59,560
I got to sleep in this bed.

1515
02:04:01,399 --> 02:04:02,199
I made the bed.

1516
02:04:02,199 --> 02:04:03,079
I got to sleep in it.

1517
02:04:04,649 --> 02:04:06,170
You can't shoot a rifle.

1518
02:04:06,170 --> 02:04:07,529
And look, this thing's like dirty.

1519
02:04:07,529 --> 02:04:09,210
I'm going to be so compulsive with this.

1520
02:04:10,250 --> 02:04:10,890
Is it clean?

1521
02:04:10,890 --> 02:04:11,609
I got to clean it.

1522
02:04:12,569 --> 02:04:17,829
Why is it damaged?

1523
02:04:17,829 --> 02:04:18,069
OK.

1524
02:04:21,609 --> 02:04:22,569
Reload it.

1525
02:04:23,130 --> 02:04:26,470
How do you reload?

1526
02:04:37,659 --> 02:04:39,340
It's circle is reload.

1527
02:04:39,340 --> 02:04:39,979
Ha!

1528
02:04:39,979 --> 02:04:40,939
Get me out of here.

1529
02:04:44,890 --> 02:04:53,510
This town hates me.

1530
02:04:53,510 --> 02:04:53,750
What?

1531
02:04:53,750 --> 02:04:55,590
Did I just go back in the same town I just left?

1532
02:04:57,079 --> 02:04:57,800
Get me out of this.

1533
02:04:58,520 --> 02:05:00,260
It's a never ending nightmare.

1534
02:05:05,720 --> 02:05:06,199
Please no.

1535
02:05:06,199 --> 02:05:07,079
Who said that?

1536
02:05:07,079 --> 02:05:09,539
They're probably talking about me.

1537
02:05:10,340 --> 02:05:15,060
I haven't even had an opportunity to cool off from that.

1538
02:05:17,050 --> 02:05:17,850
OK.

1539
02:05:17,850 --> 02:05:22,899
So the rifle, it's circle to reload.

1540
02:05:23,699 --> 02:05:24,500
Isn't it?

1541
02:05:24,500 --> 02:05:30,039
Well, you're holding setting story load game.

1542
02:05:30,039 --> 02:05:31,079
No, I can't.

1543
02:05:31,079 --> 02:05:32,600
That's no Ikea.

1544
02:05:32,600 --> 02:05:33,640
I got to sleep in this bed.

1545
02:05:37,020 --> 02:05:40,300
There are no rewinds in the Wild West, guys.

1546
02:05:41,260 --> 02:05:50,739
This guy only holds one bullet.

1547
02:05:50,739 --> 02:05:52,899
It doesn't have a hundred.

1548
02:05:56,359 --> 02:06:02,840
I bet that snakebite guy is feeling very good about himself.

1549
02:06:02,840 --> 02:06:04,119
Now he gave that to you.

1550
02:06:04,119 --> 02:06:14,380
I don't want to watch this stream anymore.

1551
02:06:16,329 --> 02:06:17,770
No, you sleep in bed.

1552
02:06:18,409 --> 02:06:18,729
OK.

1553
02:06:19,609 --> 02:06:20,569
What's happening here?

1554
02:06:21,210 --> 02:06:25,640
The farmer?

1555
02:06:25,640 --> 02:06:26,199
Where am I?

1556
02:06:33,420 --> 02:06:34,939
Mr. Thomas Downs?

1557
02:06:34,939 --> 02:06:35,899
No, it's the guy who owes money.

1558
02:06:38,229 --> 02:06:38,949
Oh, no, no.

1559
02:06:42,489 --> 02:06:44,649
We ain't a charity, Mr. Downs.

1560
02:06:45,289 --> 02:06:49,050
Why is he standing still?

1561
02:06:50,470 --> 02:06:51,270
Really?

1562
02:06:51,270 --> 02:06:52,229
Threaten me, would you?

1563
02:06:53,590 --> 02:06:54,310
Please.

1564
02:06:54,310 --> 02:06:55,510
I have a family, sir.

1565
02:06:55,510 --> 02:06:55,909
Please.

1566
02:06:56,550 --> 02:07:00,199
I don't care about your family.

1567
02:07:01,399 --> 02:07:04,220
Why did have to come to this, huh?

1568
02:07:07,050 --> 02:07:08,170
Tell me, sir.

1569
02:07:08,170 --> 02:07:09,369
I didn't want this either.

1570
02:07:09,369 --> 02:07:10,090
Just tell me.

1571
02:07:11,050 --> 02:07:11,770
Just tell me.

1572
02:07:11,770 --> 02:07:12,329
Tell me.

1573
02:07:12,329 --> 02:07:13,770
I don't want to hurt you, man.

1574
02:07:13,770 --> 02:07:14,970
I've done too much damage.

1575
02:07:15,930 --> 02:07:17,369
If you're running out on debt.

1576
02:07:17,369 --> 02:07:18,810
I don't want to hurt anybody anymore.

1577
02:07:18,810 --> 02:07:20,010
I'm not running anywhere.

1578
02:07:21,859 --> 02:07:23,220
I'm doing my best for you.

1579
02:07:24,020 --> 02:07:27,800
Or a slippery little bastard.

1580
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:29,159
But I got you now.

1581
02:07:30,039 --> 02:07:30,439
Please.

1582
02:07:31,079 --> 02:07:31,399
Please.

1583
02:07:32,199 --> 02:07:33,079
Oh, fuck.

1584
02:07:33,079 --> 02:07:34,279
Be reasonable.

1585
02:07:35,880 --> 02:07:41,350
Okay, he's mine.

1586
02:07:41,350 --> 02:07:42,949
You borrowed money from my business partner,

1587
02:07:42,949 --> 02:07:43,989
Herr Strauss.

1588
02:07:43,989 --> 02:07:44,949
You owe him.

1589
02:07:44,949 --> 02:07:46,149
You took the money.

1590
02:07:46,149 --> 02:07:48,710
He wants it back what's not to understand.

1591
02:07:51,270 --> 02:07:52,859
Where's our money?

1592
02:07:52,859 --> 02:07:53,579
I don't have it.

1593
02:07:55,340 --> 02:07:56,220
Sell your place.

1594
02:07:56,220 --> 02:07:57,819
We already owe more than it's worth.

1595
02:07:58,460 --> 02:08:02,380
Then sell your wife or your family or something.

1596
02:08:02,460 --> 02:08:04,939
We ain't your idea of charity.

1597
02:08:04,939 --> 02:08:05,500
Is that clear?

1598
02:08:08,600 --> 02:08:09,079
Thomas.

1599
02:08:09,800 --> 02:08:11,000
What are you looking at?

1600
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:11,560
Thomas.

1601
02:08:12,119 --> 02:08:13,479
I said what you looking at, woman?

1602
02:08:13,479 --> 02:08:14,680
My husband isn't well.

1603
02:08:15,640 --> 02:08:16,840
If we could just have more.

1604
02:08:16,840 --> 02:08:19,880
Like I said, we ain't nobody's idea of charity.

1605
02:08:19,880 --> 02:08:20,760
Get us the money.

1606
02:08:33,180 --> 02:08:34,300
Yeah, I didn't get it.

1607
02:08:38,899 --> 02:08:40,420
What if we're the bad guys?

1608
02:08:41,460 --> 02:08:42,020
I don't know.

1609
02:08:42,979 --> 02:08:51,529
I think he may have stolen your rifle.

1610
02:09:02,380 --> 02:09:03,739
Yeah, he's sick.

1611
02:09:04,140 --> 02:09:05,340
He like spit in my mouth.

1612
02:09:06,220 --> 02:09:07,180
I'm going to get the flu.

1613
02:09:08,060 --> 02:09:09,430
I'm going to get the death flu.

1614
02:09:20,329 --> 02:09:22,039
Back to camp.

1615
02:09:22,840 --> 02:09:30,899
So what's next?

1616
02:09:34,920 --> 02:09:36,119
Now they're running out of money here.

1617
02:09:36,840 --> 02:09:41,609
I'm going to donate this to the copper today.

1618
02:09:55,130 --> 02:09:56,010
I stole my gun.

1619
02:10:00,470 --> 02:10:02,310
Ah, how did you get on?

1620
02:10:02,310 --> 02:10:03,350
Not so good.

1621
02:10:03,909 --> 02:10:05,029
He's almost dead.

1622
02:10:05,670 --> 02:10:07,270
And they seem more or less destitute.

1623
02:10:07,270 --> 02:10:09,430
You were a fool for lending them the money.

1624
02:10:09,430 --> 02:10:11,189
Then people who aren't desperate

1625
02:10:11,189 --> 02:10:13,750
don't seem so interested in my propositions.

1626
02:10:13,750 --> 02:10:14,229
Of course.

1627
02:10:15,909 --> 02:10:25,960
Mission complete.

1628
02:10:25,960 --> 02:10:26,439
Bronze.

1629
02:10:27,640 --> 02:10:30,899
Arthur attempts to reclaim the debt from Thomas Downs

1630
02:10:30,899 --> 02:10:33,060
but finds him to be destitute.

1631
02:10:33,779 --> 02:10:34,979
Complete within two minutes.

1632
02:10:36,100 --> 02:10:37,539
Oh, that's because I wouldn't beat him up.

1633
02:10:38,970 --> 02:10:40,250
That's why I got bronze.

1634
02:10:42,600 --> 02:10:46,789
All right, let's go to the medic wagon here.

1635
02:10:49,979 --> 02:10:50,460
What we got?

1636
02:10:51,340 --> 02:10:52,060
Health cure.

1637
02:10:53,420 --> 02:10:54,220
I can't take any more.

1638
02:10:57,979 --> 02:10:59,739
How do I bathe at the camp, can I?

1639
02:10:59,739 --> 02:11:01,420
Oh, wait, actually, I have meat, don't I?

1640
02:11:02,899 --> 02:11:05,859
Oh, I bought that thing to do upgrades here.

1641
02:11:07,859 --> 02:11:08,659
Kit satchel.

1642
02:11:08,659 --> 02:11:09,300
Okay, I need...

1643
02:11:10,180 --> 02:11:11,300
Increase the carrying capacity

1644
02:11:11,300 --> 02:11:12,659
for all types of kit equipment

1645
02:11:12,659 --> 02:11:13,939
that will be used regularly.

1646
02:11:15,060 --> 02:11:17,220
This one is increase the carrying capacity

1647
02:11:17,220 --> 02:11:18,260
for all types of valuables

1648
02:11:18,260 --> 02:11:19,699
that can be sold for cash.

1649
02:11:20,899 --> 02:11:23,060
Perfect beaver, perfect beaver, perfect rabbit.

1650
02:11:23,060 --> 02:11:24,420
Something like this anywhere else.

1651
02:11:25,539 --> 02:11:28,569
I'll keep my eye out for some good food.

1652
02:11:28,569 --> 02:11:29,529
I'm gonna donate these, though.

1653
02:11:29,529 --> 02:11:31,609
I could really use some good meat for this stew.

1654
02:11:31,609 --> 02:11:33,770
Go to opossum, donate for funds,

1655
02:11:33,770 --> 02:11:35,529
donate for any provisions.

1656
02:11:37,590 --> 02:11:39,029
Oh, this shitty raccoon pal is good.

1657
02:11:39,029 --> 02:11:41,670
Sure, might as well make some money off it.

1658
02:11:43,369 --> 02:11:44,250
Get rid of the opossum.

1659
02:11:47,779 --> 02:11:49,720
Okay, let's go eat the stew

1660
02:11:49,720 --> 02:11:50,439
because it's available.

1661
02:11:56,329 --> 02:12:00,739
I'm trying to get over it.

1662
02:12:00,739 --> 02:12:01,140
I can't.

1663
02:12:02,020 --> 02:12:02,979
I'm trying, guys.

1664
02:12:11,609 --> 02:12:12,090
Let's eat.

1665
02:12:15,850 --> 02:12:16,729
Now slurp it up.

1666
02:12:16,970 --> 02:12:18,090
I want this right now.

1667
02:12:22,579 --> 02:12:26,260
What's with the same joke 100 times?

1668
02:12:26,260 --> 02:12:26,739
Which one?

1669
02:12:30,060 --> 02:12:30,779
Me?

1670
02:12:30,779 --> 02:12:31,579
Did I say something?

1671
02:12:37,960 --> 02:12:39,079
Oh, you're talking about chat.

1672
02:12:39,079 --> 02:12:39,479
Oh, okay.

1673
02:12:39,479 --> 02:12:45,340
Increase total supplies including tonics

1674
02:12:46,140 --> 02:12:50,380
to refill all stats as well as higher quality liquors.

1675
02:12:53,510 --> 02:12:57,930
Total provisions adds fresh fruit and basic canned goods.

1676
02:12:57,930 --> 02:12:58,649
Yeah, let's get this.

1677
02:13:00,409 --> 02:13:01,850
Quality and quantity of food available

1678
02:13:01,850 --> 02:13:02,970
in the pantry has increased.

1679
02:13:02,970 --> 02:13:03,369
That's good.

1680
02:13:04,010 --> 02:13:07,989
It's not a joke.

1681
02:13:07,989 --> 02:13:09,670
It's cold hard reality.

1682
02:13:10,470 --> 02:13:14,340
Whatever.

1683
02:13:14,340 --> 02:13:15,300
Real variety.

1684
02:13:15,300 --> 02:13:16,100
How much money do we have?

1685
02:13:16,979 --> 02:13:20,659
Proof of repeater ammo and arrows.

1686
02:13:20,659 --> 02:13:22,340
Actually, I like using the arrows.

1687
02:13:23,140 --> 02:13:26,869
48 bucks.

1688
02:13:27,670 --> 02:13:28,310
Yeah, let's do it.

1689
02:13:29,189 --> 02:13:31,430
Quality and quantity of ammunition available

1690
02:13:31,430 --> 02:13:32,390
at office 10 does increase.

1691
02:13:32,390 --> 02:13:35,109
You can pay to resupply munitions when stocks are low.

1692
02:13:37,399 --> 02:13:38,840
And then we're pretty much out of money.

1693
02:13:43,270 --> 02:13:45,510
I mean, we're broke, but I'm not broke.

1694
02:13:46,310 --> 02:13:47,029
So don't worry.

1695
02:13:47,750 --> 02:13:49,510
I'll take care of this.

1696
02:13:50,229 --> 02:13:55,140
Let's give some items here.

1697
02:13:56,489 --> 02:13:57,130
Eight bucks.

1698
02:13:57,930 --> 02:14:01,350
Put this one in there.

1699
02:14:02,869 --> 02:14:06,170
Gold pocket watch.

1700
02:14:06,170 --> 02:14:07,449
A couple of red wedding rings.

1701
02:14:08,250 --> 02:14:13,109
What's that face in chat?

1702
02:14:15,060 --> 02:14:16,260
We'll give like two of these.

1703
02:14:18,550 --> 02:14:19,109
That's enough.

1704
02:14:19,670 --> 02:14:20,550
How much money do they have?

1705
02:14:21,750 --> 02:14:22,149
$18.

1706
02:14:23,350 --> 02:14:25,220
That's fine.

1707
02:14:25,779 --> 02:14:26,710
That's enough.

1708
02:14:27,270 --> 02:14:32,899
Let's go to the ammo cart.

1709
02:14:35,939 --> 02:14:37,659
I need arrows.

1710
02:14:37,659 --> 02:14:38,859
Let's take these cartridges.

1711
02:14:38,859 --> 02:14:39,739
Arrows and everything.

1712
02:14:40,380 --> 02:14:43,989
All right.

1713
02:14:43,989 --> 02:14:46,250
I need, I didn't say arrows.

1714
02:14:46,970 --> 02:14:50,010
I need a bunch of these actually

1715
02:14:50,010 --> 02:14:50,649
because I used them all.

1716
02:14:51,369 --> 02:14:57,989
All right, we good.

1717
02:14:58,630 --> 02:14:59,430
Let's go to sleep.

1718
02:15:00,390 --> 02:15:02,550
And what time?

1719
02:15:02,550 --> 02:15:03,829
We've got five hours here.

1720
02:15:03,829 --> 02:15:05,109
Six and a half hours of streaming.

1721
02:15:06,899 --> 02:15:07,220
I'm good.

1722
02:15:08,020 --> 02:15:09,859
I think I'm going to get another water though.

1723
02:15:09,859 --> 02:15:10,899
So give me a second.

1724
02:15:10,899 --> 02:15:11,779
Let me go sleep.

1725
02:15:11,779 --> 02:15:13,060
Then I'm going to go BRB.

1726
02:15:13,060 --> 02:15:14,739
Grab another water and we'll keep going.

1727
02:15:22,090 --> 02:15:25,180
Sleep to morning.

1728
02:15:26,779 --> 02:15:30,020
Uh, I don't know how much I think is,

1729
02:15:30,020 --> 02:15:31,060
I need to be able to eat.

1730
02:15:31,699 --> 02:15:32,500
I haven't really eaten.

1731
02:15:33,750 --> 02:15:35,430
I had a smoothie this morning and that's it.

1732
02:15:35,989 --> 02:15:39,189
So eventually here, fairly soon,

1733
02:15:39,189 --> 02:15:41,750
I'm probably going to have to call it night.

1734
02:15:41,750 --> 02:15:43,819
It's including me.

1735
02:15:43,819 --> 02:15:47,529
I had a smoothie.

1736
02:15:47,529 --> 02:15:51,529
It was a pineapple, strawberry, and peach smoothie.

1737
02:15:51,529 --> 02:15:52,090
And it was good.

1738
02:15:54,869 --> 02:15:55,189
All right.

1739
02:15:56,069 --> 02:15:58,710
I'll probably give myself another 45 minutes

1740
02:15:58,710 --> 02:16:00,149
before it's time to end.

1741
02:16:00,149 --> 02:16:02,699
So with that, give me two seconds.

1742
02:16:02,699 --> 02:16:05,739
I'll see you guys in like a minute or two.

1743
02:18:55,379 --> 02:18:55,780
All right.

1744
02:18:57,690 --> 02:18:58,170
Yeah.

1745
02:18:58,170 --> 02:19:01,850
Probably because I got to take out Otto

1746
02:19:03,899 --> 02:19:06,979
and get some food and everything.

1747
02:19:06,979 --> 02:19:10,549
So we will do, let's do like another mission.

1748
02:19:12,040 --> 02:19:14,469
And then after that, close it up.

1749
02:19:17,850 --> 02:19:19,370
Somebody said, tired boy.

1750
02:19:20,389 --> 02:19:24,659
Yeah, I mean that, that, that my whole body,

1751
02:19:24,659 --> 02:19:25,459
it was taken out of me.

1752
02:19:28,379 --> 02:19:29,899
That last encounter just killed me.

1753
02:19:30,139 --> 02:19:32,379
Oh, okay.

1754
02:19:32,379 --> 02:19:33,500
So let's take a look.

1755
02:19:33,500 --> 02:19:34,620
This is morning now.

1756
02:19:34,620 --> 02:19:35,100
Let's see.

1757
02:19:37,909 --> 02:19:39,030
There are rabbits here though.

1758
02:19:39,989 --> 02:19:43,799
Let me try to get this challenge thing first

1759
02:19:43,799 --> 02:19:44,520
before we do anything.

1760
02:19:50,090 --> 02:19:50,809
Vroom, Vroom.

1761
02:19:55,420 --> 02:19:56,059
Vegas, baby.

1762
02:19:57,530 --> 02:19:59,670
All right.

1763
02:19:59,670 --> 02:20:01,030
I was supposed to just grab one of these.

1764
02:20:01,030 --> 02:20:01,510
Wait a minute.

1765
02:20:02,149 --> 02:20:05,350
At least let me see what it is.

1766
02:20:08,950 --> 02:20:09,989
Brown Jack.

1767
02:20:11,030 --> 02:20:12,309
Brown Broan.

1768
02:20:14,280 --> 02:20:15,399
Speednik said this thing's,

1769
02:20:15,399 --> 02:20:16,520
this thing's not even like good.

1770
02:20:18,819 --> 02:20:19,459
It's just big.

1771
02:20:25,909 --> 02:20:27,350
Hey, I'm trying to just let me pet you.

1772
02:20:29,270 --> 02:20:38,149
I feel like that Taima is a little bit better.

1773
02:20:38,950 --> 02:20:40,459
My horse is so much better.

1774
02:20:41,180 --> 02:20:43,739
I'm not that much better than Arthur's horses.

1775
02:20:44,379 --> 02:20:45,659
Okay, girl.

1776
02:20:47,020 --> 02:20:48,180
All right.

1777
02:20:48,180 --> 02:20:48,739
Now let's go.

1778
02:20:48,739 --> 02:20:50,100
I'm going to put my bow and arrow.

1779
02:20:51,139 --> 02:20:53,000
I'm going to get out of town first.

1780
02:20:56,659 --> 02:21:00,489
Okay.

1781
02:21:00,489 --> 02:21:01,129
Bow.

1782
02:21:01,129 --> 02:21:05,420
I need to be able to, I need to craft better arrows.

1783
02:21:05,420 --> 02:21:05,579
All right.

1784
02:21:05,579 --> 02:21:07,420
I need to, on horseback, I got to kill two rabbits.

1785
02:21:07,420 --> 02:21:08,459
The rabbits are over this way.

1786
02:21:14,920 --> 02:21:15,639
What was that blip?

1787
02:21:18,329 --> 02:21:18,889
Oh shit.

1788
02:21:18,889 --> 02:21:19,610
It's a snake.

1789
02:21:19,610 --> 02:21:20,250
It's a snake.

1790
02:21:21,450 --> 02:21:22,729
Study, study, study, study it.

1791
02:21:24,870 --> 02:21:26,629
Southern Copperhead Snake.

1792
02:21:27,350 --> 02:21:31,209
Where is it?

1793
02:21:31,770 --> 02:21:34,700
I don't know where it is.

1794
02:21:34,700 --> 02:21:35,100
Where is it?

1795
02:21:35,739 --> 02:21:38,979
There it is.

1796
02:21:38,979 --> 02:21:53,909
What?

1797
02:21:53,909 --> 02:21:57,129
Did the snake just die of old age?

1798
02:21:58,489 --> 02:21:59,610
How did it, wouldn't it die?

1799
02:21:59,610 --> 02:22:00,889
It hit his head on a rock.

1800
02:22:07,940 --> 02:22:08,340
Okay.

1801
02:22:08,899 --> 02:22:12,420
He just smashed his head into a fucking rock.

1802
02:22:12,420 --> 02:22:12,899
All right.

1803
02:22:12,899 --> 02:22:14,659
Well, look at the quality.

1804
02:22:15,379 --> 02:22:17,340
Look at the quality of the meat.

1805
02:22:17,340 --> 02:22:18,540
It's so, it's perfect.

1806
02:22:18,860 --> 02:22:19,340
It's perfect.

1807
02:22:19,340 --> 02:22:20,299
I'm going to bring it back to town.

1808
02:22:22,120 --> 02:22:22,360
No.

1809
02:22:22,360 --> 02:22:23,159
What do I do with this?

1810
02:22:23,159 --> 02:22:24,200
It's perfect.

1811
02:22:24,200 --> 02:22:25,239
Look at the three stars.

1812
02:22:25,959 --> 02:22:29,750
What do I do with this?

1813
02:22:29,750 --> 02:22:40,020
It's, it's, skin it?

1814
02:22:40,020 --> 02:22:41,379
Is it, will it be perfect skin?

1815
02:22:41,379 --> 02:22:42,579
Or should I just keep the whole thing?

1816
02:22:48,659 --> 02:22:51,139
Sell the butcher, cargo it, release it back into the wild.

1817
02:22:52,180 --> 02:22:53,940
Just hold it like this for the rest of the game.

1818
02:22:54,659 --> 02:22:58,020
It'll be a perfect skin.

1819
02:22:58,899 --> 02:23:01,239
All right.

1820
02:23:01,239 --> 02:23:01,559
Here we go.

1821
02:23:01,559 --> 02:23:02,200
I'm going to skin it.

1822
02:23:19,190 --> 02:23:20,069
Oh man.

1823
02:23:20,069 --> 02:23:20,389
Nice.

1824
02:23:20,389 --> 02:23:21,590
I can make perfect.

1825
02:23:21,590 --> 02:23:21,909
Okay.

1826
02:23:22,870 --> 02:23:25,510
I'm so glad he just smashed his head into a rock.

1827
02:23:25,510 --> 02:23:26,709
I didn't have to shoot it and ruin it.

1828
02:23:27,510 --> 02:23:30,180
Let's put it on the back.

1829
02:23:30,819 --> 02:23:33,850
Do I put it in a?

1830
02:23:34,809 --> 02:23:36,489
This thing's going to get all fucked up if I do,

1831
02:23:36,489 --> 02:23:37,770
if I drive stupid though, right?

1832
02:23:43,420 --> 02:23:44,139
Okay.

1833
02:23:44,139 --> 02:23:45,500
This is going to be rough.

1834
02:23:45,500 --> 02:23:46,540
I need to get rid of this somehow.

1835
02:23:46,540 --> 02:23:47,819
Should I go back to the camp?

1836
02:23:48,860 --> 02:23:56,780
Where's like a butcher?

1837
02:23:58,489 --> 02:23:59,450
Not my butcher.

1838
02:24:00,250 --> 02:24:02,170
A butcher that I can actually sell to.

1839
02:24:02,889 --> 02:24:06,950
Put it in the stew pot.

1840
02:24:11,370 --> 02:24:11,850
No, no.

1841
02:24:11,850 --> 02:24:12,729
I, let's go up here.

1842
02:24:13,450 --> 02:24:14,709
I'm going to go up.

1843
02:24:14,709 --> 02:24:15,190
But do that.

1844
02:24:15,190 --> 02:24:16,229
We're going to go up here.

1845
02:24:16,229 --> 02:24:18,709
I'm going to do this merry linden quest

1846
02:24:18,709 --> 02:24:20,069
and then I'm going to come back and get a rabbit.

1847
02:24:21,110 --> 02:24:23,770
All right.

1848
02:24:23,770 --> 02:24:24,090
Let's go.

1849
02:24:24,969 --> 02:24:30,010
I want to sell it at the butcher.

1850
02:24:30,010 --> 02:24:32,649
If it's perfect, then I kind of would want to get some money from it.

1851
02:24:33,290 --> 02:24:50,250
It's right on the road.

1852
02:24:50,250 --> 02:24:57,459
What the fuck are you doing, man?

1853
02:24:59,899 --> 02:25:01,739
What the fuck are you?

1854
02:25:01,739 --> 02:25:07,350
Oh, there's people.

1855
02:25:07,350 --> 02:25:07,989
Lots of them.

1856
02:25:53,049 --> 02:25:54,329
Everyone disliked that.

1857
02:25:55,049 --> 02:25:58,579
Maybe I get some money.

1858
02:25:58,579 --> 02:25:59,620
Oh, they're all Driscolls.

1859
02:26:00,500 --> 02:26:03,719
I mean, is there a point in this?

1860
02:26:04,520 --> 02:26:06,440
Where I get to get rid of all the Odoyles?

1861
02:26:07,319 --> 02:26:09,340
Can I throw them all off a cliff?

1862
02:26:13,379 --> 02:26:14,180
Edison?

1863
02:26:14,180 --> 02:26:14,500
Okay.

1864
02:26:14,500 --> 02:26:23,639
Not bad.

1865
02:26:23,639 --> 02:26:24,760
The Driscolls rule.

1866
02:26:26,520 --> 02:26:27,159
Seriously.

1867
02:26:27,719 --> 02:26:28,840
That's what I feel like they're doing.

1868
02:26:35,899 --> 02:26:37,260
I don't think I've had the same hat on

1869
02:26:38,309 --> 02:26:39,350
for more than five minutes.

1870
02:26:42,500 --> 02:26:43,700
They shot my snake?

1871
02:26:43,700 --> 02:26:44,340
I better not have.

1872
02:26:45,219 --> 02:26:45,860
No, it's still there.

1873
02:26:45,860 --> 02:26:46,180
It's fine.

1874
02:26:46,899 --> 02:26:50,090
It's still fine.

1875
02:27:01,129 --> 02:27:10,889
Holy shit.

1876
02:27:15,770 --> 02:27:17,049
Speaking of guns, what is that?

1877
02:27:17,770 --> 02:27:24,809
This is a Warren-Kattelman revolver.

1878
02:27:24,809 --> 02:27:25,370
No.

1879
02:27:25,370 --> 02:27:26,090
That thing sucks.

1880
02:27:26,809 --> 02:27:28,409
Oh, does it bounce?

1881
02:27:28,409 --> 02:27:30,010
So it was Driscolls,

1882
02:27:30,010 --> 02:27:31,049
and then it was bounties.

1883
02:27:33,159 --> 02:27:35,290
When are they going to realize

1884
02:27:35,290 --> 02:27:36,409
that they're not going to take me down?

1885
02:27:36,409 --> 02:27:38,010
They may as well just make me the president.

1886
02:27:38,889 --> 02:27:42,149
You know?

1887
02:27:42,149 --> 02:27:43,190
At what point is it just like,

1888
02:27:43,190 --> 02:27:44,229
fine, you can be emperor.

1889
02:27:51,020 --> 02:27:51,819
All right.

1890
02:27:51,819 --> 02:27:52,940
You're unstoppable.

1891
02:27:52,940 --> 02:27:54,459
You now, like that's what...

1892
02:27:59,049 --> 02:28:00,569
Sorry, I just ran into Tony Hawk

1893
02:28:00,569 --> 02:28:01,690
and show you how cool I was.

1894
02:28:02,489 --> 02:28:22,709
Pay off your bounties.

1895
02:28:22,709 --> 02:28:23,590
I'll do that here.

1896
02:28:23,590 --> 02:28:24,629
Do I have enough money to do that?

1897
02:28:25,989 --> 02:28:28,790
I didn't realize the United States was a monarchy.

1898
02:28:29,510 --> 02:28:31,750
No, but see, you make me the emperor

1899
02:28:32,469 --> 02:28:35,030
and then 10 of the most loyal,

1900
02:28:35,030 --> 02:28:36,149
most dedicated generals

1901
02:28:36,149 --> 02:28:37,829
then work to have me removed.

1902
02:28:38,950 --> 02:28:39,909
And then, you know,

1903
02:28:39,909 --> 02:28:41,430
while I'm sitting there eating grapes

1904
02:28:42,709 --> 02:28:44,549
and sleeping on like salted beef,

1905
02:28:45,350 --> 02:28:47,989
you just like throw a fucking dart in my face.

1906
02:28:47,989 --> 02:28:48,790
And that's it.

1907
02:28:48,790 --> 02:28:49,510
I'll get fat.

1908
02:28:50,229 --> 02:28:51,270
I'll get overconfident.

1909
02:28:54,549 --> 02:28:55,989
If you think your little spell away...

1910
02:29:01,879 --> 02:29:02,760
Look at that.

1911
02:29:02,760 --> 02:29:04,379
I'm not selling that though.

1912
02:29:04,379 --> 02:29:05,340
Perfect carcass.

1913
02:29:12,889 --> 02:29:13,850
What are you talking about?

1914
02:29:14,489 --> 02:29:16,379
Just read between the lines.

1915
02:29:21,819 --> 02:29:24,379
1.6, 1.7.

1916
02:29:25,979 --> 02:29:27,180
I can't do anything else with this.

1917
02:29:27,180 --> 02:29:28,459
So just take it.

1918
02:29:29,020 --> 02:29:30,059
I'm going to keep this though.

1919
02:29:30,059 --> 02:29:31,180
Does this spoil at all?

1920
02:29:33,979 --> 02:29:35,340
Or is it always going to be perfect?

1921
02:29:42,260 --> 02:29:43,940
Yeah, I'm not going to sell this to this guy.

1922
02:29:43,940 --> 02:29:46,260
No, I can use it anytime it says using crafting.

1923
02:29:46,260 --> 02:29:47,139
I'm not going to sell it.

1924
02:29:48,809 --> 02:29:50,069
Really have anything else for you.

1925
02:29:57,610 --> 02:29:58,250
What the hell?

1926
02:30:01,610 --> 02:30:02,489
Sell to the trapper?

1927
02:30:02,489 --> 02:30:03,049
Not this guy?

1928
02:30:03,049 --> 02:30:04,729
No, that's the skin though.

1929
02:30:04,729 --> 02:30:06,250
The carcass skin to use for anything.

1930
02:30:06,969 --> 02:30:11,190
Let's go to this one.

1931
02:30:11,989 --> 02:30:12,389
Actually, you know what?

1932
02:30:12,389 --> 02:30:13,989
I'm going to store this guy.

1933
02:30:13,989 --> 02:30:14,709
Actually, hold on a minute.

1934
02:30:14,709 --> 02:30:16,069
Let me like at least clean this.

1935
02:30:16,870 --> 02:30:18,069
I'm going to go bring Whisper up.

1936
02:30:20,440 --> 02:30:21,319
You are dirty.

1937
02:30:24,680 --> 02:30:39,260
Should I be holding this or tapping it?

1938
02:30:54,469 --> 02:30:56,069
Don't pay your bounty whatever you do.

1939
02:30:58,469 --> 02:30:59,350
Okay, nice and clean.

1940
02:31:03,290 --> 02:31:06,969
Let's get you in storage and bring out Whisper.

1941
02:31:11,319 --> 02:31:12,360
Good looking horse there.

1942
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:14,600
If you want me to keep that overnight,

1943
02:31:14,600 --> 02:31:16,200
there's room in the stable.

1944
02:31:16,200 --> 02:31:17,239
Okay, here's Whisper.

1945
02:31:18,440 --> 02:31:19,000
Saddle up.

1946
02:31:20,870 --> 02:31:21,829
So here's Whisper.

1947
02:31:23,129 --> 02:31:26,860
I think I hate how I'm saying horse care package.

1948
02:31:28,020 --> 02:31:30,180
Wish more folks took care of their horses like you.

1949
02:31:30,899 --> 02:31:31,459
All right, that's good.

1950
02:31:35,159 --> 02:31:36,440
You have to stable your horses.

1951
02:31:36,440 --> 02:31:37,559
You can't just overuse them.

1952
02:31:37,559 --> 02:31:39,079
They'll get tired and fucked up.

1953
02:31:42,569 --> 02:31:48,440
I just want him to knock the board out of his hands.

1954
02:31:48,440 --> 02:31:49,319
I'm not trying to be dick.

1955
02:31:52,520 --> 02:31:54,440
Just trying to get the board knocked out of his hands.

1956
02:31:56,920 --> 02:31:57,719
Change the braided tail.

1957
02:31:57,719 --> 02:31:58,920
No, that's how I know it's my horse.

1958
02:32:03,450 --> 02:32:04,569
Your edgy horse.

1959
02:32:06,500 --> 02:32:08,659
Okay, let's go talk to Mary.

1960
02:32:09,780 --> 02:32:21,180
Hello.

1961
02:32:21,180 --> 02:32:22,950
We loved once in true.

1962
02:32:24,229 --> 02:32:25,590
Now, this is the love interest.

1963
02:32:26,469 --> 02:32:27,670
Oh shit, I forgot to take a bath.

1964
02:32:30,139 --> 02:32:30,459
Yes.

1965
02:32:31,180 --> 02:32:31,899
Oh, I'm sorry.

1966
02:32:31,899 --> 02:32:33,579
I didn't mean to disturb you, ma'am.

1967
02:32:35,110 --> 02:32:36,950
Is Mrs. Linton in?

1968
02:32:37,670 --> 02:32:38,309
I'll go see.

1969
02:32:41,690 --> 02:32:44,809
Mrs. Linton, a caller for you.

1970
02:32:44,809 --> 02:32:46,329
The braided hair won't get tangled, I know.

1971
02:32:48,020 --> 02:32:48,420
I know.

1972
02:32:49,139 --> 02:32:53,590
Hello, Arthur.

1973
02:32:54,389 --> 02:32:56,840
Oh, you look like shit.

1974
02:32:57,559 --> 02:32:57,959
Mary.

1975
02:32:58,680 --> 02:32:59,559
I know, I know.

1976
02:33:01,209 --> 02:33:03,610
I heard you and your friends was around.

1977
02:33:03,610 --> 02:33:03,770
I...

1978
02:33:04,729 --> 02:33:05,049
Okay.

1979
02:33:06,549 --> 02:33:07,110
Where's, um...

1980
02:33:07,829 --> 02:33:09,290
Where's what's his name?

1981
02:33:10,459 --> 02:33:11,340
Died.

1982
02:33:11,340 --> 02:33:13,780
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

1983
02:33:13,780 --> 02:33:14,819
Yeah, me too.

1984
02:33:15,860 --> 02:33:16,340
Me too.

1985
02:33:17,719 --> 02:33:18,840
Happened a while ago.

1986
02:33:20,280 --> 02:33:21,000
Pneumonia.

1987
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:22,200
Bad business.

1988
02:33:22,200 --> 02:33:22,520
Sure.

1989
02:33:24,600 --> 02:33:27,239
So, uh, you've been...

1990
02:33:28,659 --> 02:33:32,250
You've been made a widow and come here looking for me?

1991
02:33:32,250 --> 02:33:32,969
Is that it?

1992
02:33:32,969 --> 02:33:35,129
No, ain't like that, Arthur.

1993
02:33:36,329 --> 02:33:36,729
Okay.

1994
02:33:39,020 --> 02:33:41,100
Listen, Arthur, I...

1995
02:33:42,420 --> 02:33:42,739
I'm...

1996
02:33:44,860 --> 02:33:45,500
My family.

1997
02:33:46,920 --> 02:33:48,280
I need your help.

1998
02:33:48,280 --> 02:33:51,239
You mean the family that always looked down on me?

1999
02:33:51,879 --> 02:33:53,159
You want me to help them?

2000
02:33:53,159 --> 02:33:54,840
It's my little brother, Jamie.

2001
02:33:55,639 --> 02:33:58,229
I always liked Jamie.

2002
02:33:58,870 --> 02:34:00,549
At least compared to the rest of them.

2003
02:34:01,270 --> 02:34:07,299
He's broken daddy's heart.

2004
02:34:08,100 --> 02:34:08,899
Daddy has a heart?

2005
02:34:08,899 --> 02:34:10,819
Don't make me beg you, Arthur.

2006
02:34:10,819 --> 02:34:13,190
My money, my life, me.

2007
02:34:14,069 --> 02:34:15,510
I wasn't good enough.

2008
02:34:15,510 --> 02:34:16,149
I'm sorry.

2009
02:34:16,149 --> 02:34:17,270
This looks like it's deliberate.

2010
02:34:17,270 --> 02:34:18,870
We need your help real bad.

2011
02:34:19,430 --> 02:34:22,549
Little Jamie's joined the Chilonians.

2012
02:34:22,549 --> 02:34:24,389
That strange religious order.

2013
02:34:24,389 --> 02:34:26,629
I've rolled around in mud before I walked to the door.

2014
02:34:26,629 --> 02:34:27,590
That's like how fresh that is.

2015
02:34:27,590 --> 02:34:28,709
They'll kill him.

2016
02:34:28,709 --> 02:34:31,270
You're the only person he'd listen to.

2017
02:34:31,270 --> 02:34:35,750
So, I'm too rough to marry into your family.

2018
02:34:35,750 --> 02:34:38,709
But it's okay to ask me to help in saving your family.

2019
02:34:38,709 --> 02:34:39,510
I'm sorry.

2020
02:34:40,069 --> 02:34:42,309
I understand if you don't want to help me, but...

2021
02:34:43,030 --> 02:34:45,270
But I think of you often.

2022
02:34:46,069 --> 02:34:48,219
No time will go now.

2023
02:34:48,219 --> 02:34:49,739
I'm begging you, Arthur.

2024
02:34:50,299 --> 02:34:52,540
I say let Jamie live Jamie's life

2025
02:34:52,540 --> 02:34:55,579
and not the nightmare that his daddy dreamed up for him.

2026
02:34:55,579 --> 02:34:57,739
Jamie's so innocent, Arthur.

2027
02:34:59,340 --> 02:35:01,670
Please, Arthur.

2028
02:35:04,659 --> 02:35:05,540
Will you help me?

2029
02:35:10,389 --> 02:35:14,500
I think I got to help her, right?

2030
02:35:16,790 --> 02:35:17,590
I don't know.

2031
02:35:17,590 --> 02:35:18,389
I got to...

2032
02:35:18,389 --> 02:35:19,510
Oh, it's don't help her.

2033
02:35:19,510 --> 02:35:20,629
It's the first coming up here.

2034
02:35:20,629 --> 02:35:21,829
Please, Arthur.

2035
02:35:22,889 --> 02:35:23,850
Oh, shit.

2036
02:35:23,850 --> 02:35:24,809
Time's running out.

2037
02:35:24,809 --> 02:35:25,209
I'm helping.

2038
02:35:25,209 --> 02:35:25,709
Where is he?

2039
02:35:27,059 --> 02:35:29,700
Somewhere out near Carmody Dell, I think.

2040
02:35:29,700 --> 02:35:32,500
The rancher there said he'd seen him around the Cumberland forest.

2041
02:35:32,500 --> 02:35:34,100
I mean, good boy points, guys.

2042
02:35:34,100 --> 02:35:35,059
Don't you understand?

2043
02:35:35,059 --> 02:35:38,899
Arthur, if you find him, bring him to me at the station.

2044
02:35:38,899 --> 02:35:40,100
I'll see what I can do.

2045
02:35:40,100 --> 02:35:41,219
I can't just do everything bad.

2046
02:35:41,219 --> 02:35:41,620
I need to...

2047
02:35:41,620 --> 02:35:42,899
I've done so many bad things.

2048
02:35:45,219 --> 02:35:46,260
You already owe me.

2049
02:35:49,819 --> 02:35:50,780
Good boy points.

2050
02:35:53,100 --> 02:35:53,819
Come on.

2051
02:35:53,819 --> 02:35:55,129
Look, don't you understand?

2052
02:35:55,129 --> 02:35:59,129
For every time that we run over a fucking town of people in our car,

2053
02:36:00,090 --> 02:36:04,280
for every time I shoot my tuba desk at somebody, like on the street,

2054
02:36:04,920 --> 02:36:06,200
we have to balance it out.

2055
02:36:07,319 --> 02:36:14,170
I have to do a good deed every once in a while.

2056
02:36:14,170 --> 02:36:16,010
And this is far away, Mary.

2057
02:36:23,719 --> 02:36:24,760
Okay, Thanos.

2058
02:36:26,440 --> 02:36:32,420
You can't just do all bad things.

2059
02:36:32,979 --> 02:36:43,500
Good idea.

2060
02:36:43,500 --> 02:36:44,139
No.

2061
02:36:44,139 --> 02:36:52,250
He's got to be occasionally good so he doesn't stand for anything.

2062
02:36:53,209 --> 02:37:02,549
Rated tails messing with your head.

2063
02:37:03,430 --> 02:37:04,489
Why?

2064
02:37:04,950 --> 02:37:12,780
He was thinking about blasting the lady on the porch.

2065
02:37:12,780 --> 02:37:13,340
I could see it.

2066
02:37:14,459 --> 02:37:16,260
And I didn't do it.

2067
02:37:21,049 --> 02:37:22,889
That's not part of my bad guy allowance.

2068
02:37:36,569 --> 02:37:37,629
Okay.

2069
02:37:39,850 --> 02:37:40,350
I tried.

2070
02:37:42,250 --> 02:37:43,049
I tried to kill her.

2071
02:37:48,899 --> 02:37:49,399
Okay.

2072
02:37:51,860 --> 02:37:52,420
God damn it.

2073
02:37:52,420 --> 02:37:53,299
I was in the middle of something.

2074
02:38:00,979 --> 02:38:05,690
Awful evil?

2075
02:38:05,690 --> 02:38:07,690
I don't know if that's the kind of character I'm playing.

2076
02:38:07,690 --> 02:38:08,809
That horse did right by me.

2077
02:38:09,770 --> 02:38:11,690
Better than my husband, truth be told.

2078
02:38:12,409 --> 02:38:14,409
That fool always complaining.

2079
02:38:14,409 --> 02:38:16,329
But does he do something about it?

2080
02:38:16,329 --> 02:38:16,809
Whatever.

2081
02:38:16,809 --> 02:38:17,530
It don't matter.

2082
02:38:17,530 --> 02:38:19,690
Barely lifts his hand to wave the flies away.

2083
02:38:19,690 --> 02:38:21,450
Actually, I am kind of playing like evil.

2084
02:38:22,809 --> 02:38:24,329
Marriage for me has been nothing but trouble.

2085
02:38:24,329 --> 02:38:25,690
He did a lot of dangerous shit.

2086
02:38:26,409 --> 02:38:27,129
But Biscuit?

2087
02:38:27,930 --> 02:38:29,370
He was a fine animal.

2088
02:38:30,250 --> 02:38:31,049
Jumping over stuff.

2089
02:38:32,329 --> 02:38:33,370
Flying over cars.

2090
02:38:33,370 --> 02:38:34,969
Flying over, you know, jumping over ranches.

2091
02:38:34,969 --> 02:38:35,690
And stuff like that.

2092
02:38:35,690 --> 02:38:39,610
No one had one of them mountain boys pull a gun on me once.

2093
02:38:45,500 --> 02:38:48,299
Koda and it stopped by a nice warm patch.

2094
02:38:49,100 --> 02:38:49,979
What the fuck is that rabbit?

2095
02:38:54,940 --> 02:38:57,180
I mean, if you want to be like lawful evil, evil enable.

2096
02:38:57,180 --> 02:38:58,860
I wake up and find some nasty piece of work

2097
02:38:58,860 --> 02:39:01,260
pointing a rusty shotgun straight at me.

2098
02:39:02,059 --> 02:39:05,420
Well, he gets wheezing on and I must have made some sort of noise.

2099
02:39:05,500 --> 02:39:08,620
Because, well, you quit it already.

2100
02:39:08,620 --> 02:39:10,139
Think you might have got 20.

2101
02:39:10,139 --> 02:39:11,420
What is wrong with you?

2102
02:39:17,350 --> 02:39:17,909
Oh, yeah.

2103
02:39:19,270 --> 02:39:20,870
Jump over three obstacles in 15 seconds.

2104
02:39:22,149 --> 02:39:24,889
I tell the husband, what does he do?

2105
02:39:24,889 --> 02:39:25,610
What does the time start?

2106
02:39:25,610 --> 02:39:27,940
You've never gone over there.

2107
02:39:27,940 --> 02:39:28,500
Over the tree.

2108
02:39:28,500 --> 02:39:29,799
Thanks.

2109
02:39:29,799 --> 02:39:30,920
Over the rock.

2110
02:39:30,920 --> 02:39:32,360
You aiming and knocked me off.

2111
02:39:32,360 --> 02:39:32,860
One.

2112
02:39:35,340 --> 02:39:36,940
Emerald ranches the other way.

2113
02:39:37,579 --> 02:39:38,079
Anyways.

2114
02:39:38,700 --> 02:39:39,200
Right.

2115
02:39:39,659 --> 02:39:41,989
For the time being.

2116
02:39:41,989 --> 02:39:42,489
Again.

2117
02:40:09,590 --> 02:40:11,670
Jump over three obstacles in 15 seconds.

2118
02:40:21,819 --> 02:40:22,940
That's not part of the balance.

2119
02:40:32,059 --> 02:40:36,299
How do you jump over the three objects in 15 seconds?

2120
02:40:36,299 --> 02:40:39,260
I have to go to like a stable for that.

2121
02:40:43,139 --> 02:40:44,180
Jesus Christ.

2122
02:40:46,180 --> 02:40:48,569
Just jump over a fence three times.

2123
02:40:48,569 --> 02:40:49,450
I panicked.

2124
02:40:49,450 --> 02:40:51,049
I saw the fucking text on the screen.

2125
02:40:51,049 --> 02:40:52,409
I thought it was like a GT.

2126
02:40:52,409 --> 02:40:54,569
Remember in Grand Theft Auto when they would do the random like,

2127
02:40:54,569 --> 02:40:58,250
hey, by the way, pass four people in 10 seconds.

2128
02:40:58,250 --> 02:40:59,450
And you're like, oh shit, oh nice.

2129
02:41:01,450 --> 02:41:10,170
That happens all the time in GTA 5.

2130
02:41:10,729 --> 02:41:12,579
Especially, well, GTA Online, right?

2131
02:41:22,059 --> 02:41:22,860
Yeah, I'm sorry here.

2132
02:41:25,879 --> 02:41:27,079
GTA, yeah, GTA Online.

2133
02:41:27,959 --> 02:41:34,459
I bet I'm going to meet all the people I've helped in the afterlife.

2134
02:41:47,750 --> 02:41:54,090
Well, the shell of safety.

2135
02:41:55,049 --> 02:41:56,010
What am I supposed to do?

2136
02:41:56,010 --> 02:41:57,209
Shell of safety.

2137
02:41:57,209 --> 02:41:59,100
Shell of safety.

2138
02:41:59,100 --> 02:42:00,139
Can I speak to the boy?

2139
02:42:00,860 --> 02:42:01,579
Arthur?

2140
02:42:01,579 --> 02:42:02,299
Hello, son.

2141
02:42:03,100 --> 02:42:05,049
Your sister is very worried.

2142
02:42:05,770 --> 02:42:08,709
The boy has chosen a path, sir.

2143
02:42:08,709 --> 02:42:09,430
Cultist shield.

2144
02:42:10,469 --> 02:42:11,030
Okay, let's see.

2145
02:42:11,030 --> 02:42:11,670
Guy on the left.

2146
02:42:13,370 --> 02:42:14,809
Guy in the back is the most intimidating back left.

2147
02:42:14,809 --> 02:42:16,250
His sister just wants to speak with him.

2148
02:42:16,969 --> 02:42:19,879
Arthur, I've chosen a path.

2149
02:42:20,520 --> 02:42:21,959
Yeah, that's the big, the big group.

2150
02:42:21,959 --> 02:42:24,280
The boy has chosen a path.

2151
02:42:24,280 --> 02:42:26,040
He's chosen safety.

2152
02:42:27,079 --> 02:42:29,559
What path have you chosen, sir?

2153
02:42:30,600 --> 02:42:33,049
Oh, browns.

2154
02:42:33,850 --> 02:42:38,840
No, about this nonsense.

2155
02:42:38,840 --> 02:42:40,120
Let me speak to the boy.

2156
02:42:41,879 --> 02:42:45,239
Are you always this negative and antagonistic, sir?

2157
02:42:46,440 --> 02:42:49,079
I'm sorry.

2158
02:42:50,600 --> 02:42:53,209
Don't you, ma'am.

2159
02:42:53,209 --> 02:42:54,840
Forgive me, please.

2160
02:42:56,680 --> 02:43:00,950
I am a fool for my god and a happy one, sir.

2161
02:43:01,750 --> 02:43:02,860
Bless you.

2162
02:43:02,860 --> 02:43:03,500
Use God.

2163
02:43:03,500 --> 02:43:04,219
No.

2164
02:43:04,219 --> 02:43:05,899
What do I dream about?

2165
02:43:06,540 --> 02:43:08,700
Who are my heroes?

2166
02:43:09,739 --> 02:43:11,739
Uh, Spider-Man.

2167
02:43:14,569 --> 02:43:14,969
Fools.

2168
02:43:15,610 --> 02:43:18,250
You're a fool for everyone's god.

2169
02:43:18,250 --> 02:43:19,370
You're a maniac.

2170
02:43:19,370 --> 02:43:21,930
Now let me talk to the god damn boy.

2171
02:43:22,889 --> 02:43:28,379
Move out of my way.

2172
02:43:28,379 --> 02:43:29,700
Fool?

2173
02:43:29,700 --> 02:43:32,389
What does throttle mean?

2174
02:43:33,270 --> 02:43:34,709
God damn lunatic.

2175
02:43:36,170 --> 02:43:36,889
Kill him.

2176
02:43:37,770 --> 02:43:41,770
That's enough, Arthur.

2177
02:43:42,569 --> 02:43:43,530
Kid, come on.

2178
02:43:43,530 --> 02:43:44,170
Did I kill him?

2179
02:43:44,170 --> 02:43:44,809
This is crap.

2180
02:43:44,809 --> 02:43:45,850
You're better than this.

2181
02:43:45,850 --> 02:43:46,649
Better than what?

2182
02:43:47,290 --> 02:43:49,049
Better than one in paradise?

2183
02:43:49,049 --> 02:43:52,649
Better than thinking these fools know a damn thing about paradise.

2184
02:43:52,649 --> 02:43:53,370
Now he's done.

2185
02:43:53,370 --> 02:43:54,409
Now let me take you home.

2186
02:43:54,409 --> 02:43:56,250
You're a sad man, Arthur.

2187
02:43:56,250 --> 02:43:57,530
You're a real sad man.

2188
02:43:58,250 --> 02:43:59,850
Sure, but come home.

2189
02:43:59,850 --> 02:44:00,809
Not a chance.

2190
02:44:02,409 --> 02:44:05,209
Leave me alone, Arthur.

2191
02:44:05,209 --> 02:44:07,459
I didn't ask for your help.

2192
02:44:07,459 --> 02:44:07,959
Yah!

2193
02:44:08,659 --> 02:44:13,879
I'll get him.

2194
02:44:13,879 --> 02:44:14,379
Yah!

2195
02:44:15,700 --> 02:44:17,139
He ain't gonna outrun Whisper.

2196
02:44:19,059 --> 02:44:22,729
My horse is way fucking faster than yours, ain't it?

2197
02:44:23,690 --> 02:44:26,870
Oh.

2198
02:44:26,870 --> 02:44:27,370
Hey!

2199
02:44:28,069 --> 02:44:34,489
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!

2200
02:44:35,049 --> 02:44:39,059
You're just using it.

2201
02:44:39,059 --> 02:44:40,649
Tell you what you want to hear.

2202
02:44:40,649 --> 02:44:43,030
Why did they throw all these obstacles in my way?

2203
02:44:43,030 --> 02:44:44,229
Get out of the fucking way.

2204
02:45:00,729 --> 02:45:16,659
I wasn't gonna kill him.

2205
02:45:16,659 --> 02:45:17,159
I'm kidding.

2206
02:45:20,420 --> 02:45:21,780
Obviously have to lasso him.

2207
02:45:21,780 --> 02:45:22,579
Just gotta get close enough.

2208
02:45:22,579 --> 02:45:23,700
Sorry I didn't understand.

2209
02:45:24,260 --> 02:45:26,579
There's gonna be a lookout for the obstacle on the road.

2210
02:45:27,379 --> 02:45:28,420
Of course he gets by it.

2211
02:45:30,840 --> 02:45:32,840
You're just using it.

2212
02:45:32,840 --> 02:45:34,840
Tell you what you want to hear.

2213
02:45:34,840 --> 02:45:43,670
Why do your sisters worry about you?

2214
02:45:43,670 --> 02:45:45,420
This is none of your damn business.

2215
02:45:45,420 --> 02:45:46,459
Oh!

2216
02:45:46,459 --> 02:45:49,700
I tried to run him over.

2217
02:45:49,700 --> 02:45:51,459
Just get old, get on with it.

2218
02:46:05,670 --> 02:46:07,770
This is crazy.

2219
02:46:07,770 --> 02:46:08,270
I can't get it.

2220
02:46:08,270 --> 02:46:08,809
Come on, Yates.

2221
02:46:08,809 --> 02:46:11,770
Stupid, you can see this is crazy.

2222
02:46:11,770 --> 02:46:13,049
You're the crazy one.

2223
02:46:13,930 --> 02:46:14,430
Yah!

2224
02:46:17,239 --> 02:46:19,319
Dammit, we gotta do this the hard way.

2225
02:46:19,959 --> 02:46:21,559
I don't have to answer to you.

2226
02:46:21,559 --> 02:46:26,569
The fastest horse in the game.

2227
02:46:26,569 --> 02:46:38,700
The horse is gonna die.

2228
02:47:06,299 --> 02:47:07,819
Not a good idea, not a good idea.

2229
02:47:26,489 --> 02:47:28,889
Oh, what did he say?

2230
02:47:32,889 --> 02:47:35,610
Now you're fucked.

2231
02:47:42,459 --> 02:47:48,219
What are we doing?

2232
02:47:50,090 --> 02:47:50,729
What are we doing?

2233
02:47:53,799 --> 02:47:56,860
Slowly press R2 to fill the meter.

2234
02:47:56,860 --> 02:47:58,059
The more full the meter the...

2235
02:47:58,700 --> 02:47:59,340
What?

2236
02:47:59,340 --> 02:47:59,840
Slowly.

2237
02:48:15,799 --> 02:48:16,760
Let me read this again.

2238
02:48:16,760 --> 02:48:17,639
Hold on, I freaked out.

2239
02:48:17,639 --> 02:48:18,680
What is he telling me?

2240
02:48:18,680 --> 02:48:19,180
Load?

2241
02:48:22,440 --> 02:48:27,139
Slowly press R2 to fill the meter.

2242
02:48:27,139 --> 02:48:28,100
The more the meter...

2243
02:48:39,940 --> 02:48:41,219
Okay, I need to like do that again.

2244
02:48:41,219 --> 02:48:42,739
I don't even know what he's trying to tell me to do.

2245
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:56,120
You can't, you can't, you can't do it.

2246
02:48:56,120 --> 02:48:56,920
I'm gonna do it.

2247
02:49:02,489 --> 02:49:02,989
Jesus.

2248
02:49:03,870 --> 02:49:06,030
The one thing I do know.

2249
02:49:06,030 --> 02:49:08,379
Is he gonna give him the gun back?

2250
02:49:10,219 --> 02:49:11,739
I'll miss you Arthur.

2251
02:49:11,739 --> 02:49:13,340
I don't know if I would give that back to him.

2252
02:49:13,340 --> 02:49:13,979
Are you and Marys sweet on another again?

2253
02:49:17,530 --> 02:49:19,530
That's all a long time ago son.

2254
02:49:21,309 --> 02:49:21,870
Let's go.

2255
02:49:22,670 --> 02:49:24,110
We're on my horse, right?

2256
02:49:24,110 --> 02:49:27,389
Well, this wasn't how I thought today would turn out.

2257
02:49:27,950 --> 02:49:30,510
It's been a long time, Jamie Gillis.

2258
02:49:31,309 --> 02:49:33,309
You were a kid last time I saw you.

2259
02:49:34,190 --> 02:49:36,190
Didn't try to change something.

2260
02:49:36,270 --> 02:49:39,309
You know, you taught me how to ride a horse.

2261
02:49:40,030 --> 02:49:43,629
To uh, lonier though?

2262
02:49:44,270 --> 02:49:44,770
Really?

2263
02:49:45,309 --> 02:49:46,350
You'd fall for that?

2264
02:49:46,909 --> 02:49:48,590
They were very nice to me.

2265
02:49:49,629 --> 02:49:50,350
They're decent.

2266
02:49:50,909 --> 02:49:51,629
I'm sure.

2267
02:49:52,510 --> 02:49:54,590
Please tell me you didn't give them any money.

2268
02:49:55,549 --> 02:49:56,989
Desk tube is not gone.

2269
02:49:57,709 --> 02:49:59,159
It's right here.

2270
02:49:59,159 --> 02:50:00,120
Of course I did.

2271
02:50:00,920 --> 02:50:02,920
They rely on charitable donations.

2272
02:50:03,479 --> 02:50:05,159
Jesus, Jamie.

2273
02:50:05,159 --> 02:50:05,659
Come on.

2274
02:50:06,360 --> 02:50:08,680
I just wanted to believe that there might be something good

2275
02:50:08,680 --> 02:50:09,879
come on my way one day.

2276
02:50:10,440 --> 02:50:11,959
Yes, that's dead in the water.

2277
02:50:12,680 --> 02:50:14,120
It's the turtle.

2278
02:50:14,120 --> 02:50:14,600
Shut up.

2279
02:50:15,639 --> 02:50:19,819
Father kept telling me was you won't amount to anything.

2280
02:50:19,819 --> 02:50:21,340
You're not enough of a man.

2281
02:50:21,340 --> 02:50:22,620
I had to get away.

2282
02:50:22,620 --> 02:50:24,829
I couldn't take you anymore.

2283
02:50:24,829 --> 02:50:28,760
Forgive me, but your father's a bully and a coward.

2284
02:50:28,760 --> 02:50:30,200
Don't listen to him.

2285
02:50:30,200 --> 02:50:31,719
Hey, don't talk about him like that.

2286
02:50:32,440 --> 02:50:34,680
What do you want me to say, Jamie?

2287
02:50:34,680 --> 02:50:35,799
He's a good father.

2288
02:50:36,440 --> 02:50:37,799
Nice man.

2289
02:50:37,799 --> 02:50:39,239
He won't be happy I saw you.

2290
02:50:40,120 --> 02:50:42,760
Please send him my worst regards.

2291
02:50:42,760 --> 02:50:44,040
Jump three obstacles.

2292
02:50:44,040 --> 02:50:45,959
I'm not going to do that right now.

2293
02:50:45,959 --> 02:50:47,319
I'm not good at anything.

2294
02:50:48,120 --> 02:50:50,280
I'm going to get to a fence and then get it done.

2295
02:50:50,280 --> 02:50:51,399
Tell me something you like.

2296
02:50:52,360 --> 02:50:55,530
Don't think too hard.

2297
02:50:55,530 --> 02:50:56,489
Don't fall here.

2298
02:50:56,489 --> 02:50:58,010
Apples, I guess.

2299
02:50:58,010 --> 02:50:59,370
You like apples?

2300
02:50:59,370 --> 02:51:00,569
Yeah, I love apples.

2301
02:51:01,450 --> 02:51:01,950
Okay.

2302
02:51:02,649 --> 02:51:04,489
Well, I was thinking more along the lines of

2303
02:51:04,489 --> 02:51:05,610
Somebody's got to love apples.

2304
02:51:05,610 --> 02:51:07,209
You know, people that own apple farms.

2305
02:51:07,209 --> 02:51:08,090
You got to really love them.

2306
02:51:08,090 --> 02:51:08,809
All right, go work in the office.

2307
02:51:08,809 --> 02:51:09,930
Where do you think your apples come from?

2308
02:51:09,930 --> 02:51:10,969
That's respectable.

2309
02:51:11,129 --> 02:51:13,610
You must really like shooting and robbing people.

2310
02:51:14,250 --> 02:51:17,450
I only like shooting young idiots who run away from me

2311
02:51:17,450 --> 02:51:19,129
when I'm trying to help them.

2312
02:51:19,129 --> 02:51:20,649
You told me what you do.

2313
02:51:21,370 --> 02:51:23,129
I'm sure he did.

2314
02:51:23,129 --> 02:51:26,510
Are you still with Dutch and what was his name?

2315
02:51:26,510 --> 02:51:27,389
Hester?

2316
02:51:27,389 --> 02:51:28,350
Jose.

2317
02:51:28,350 --> 02:51:30,989
Yep, still the same sort of.

2318
02:51:30,989 --> 02:51:32,510
And Annabelle and Bessie?

2319
02:51:33,229 --> 02:51:34,670
I'm afraid they're dead.

2320
02:51:35,469 --> 02:51:35,870
Shit.

2321
02:51:35,870 --> 02:51:36,909
Doesn't count.

2322
02:51:36,909 --> 02:51:38,989
Maybe Mary did make the right choice.

2323
02:51:40,030 --> 02:51:40,909
No doubt.

2324
02:51:42,799 --> 02:51:46,479
It is anything like the nonsense you read in the newspapers.

2325
02:51:47,200 --> 02:51:49,200
So, are you two getting back together?

2326
02:51:49,760 --> 02:51:50,959
I told you no.

2327
02:51:52,159 --> 02:51:53,520
Just ask me for a favor.

2328
02:51:53,520 --> 02:51:56,159
I had from valentine's words in less than five minutes.

2329
02:51:56,799 --> 02:51:57,520
Pneumonia.

2330
02:51:58,239 --> 02:51:59,440
You told me.

2331
02:51:59,440 --> 02:52:02,000
So the door is open, so to speak.

2332
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:03,520
Okay, well, I got a really fast horse.

2333
02:52:03,520 --> 02:52:04,639
Might be able to do that.

2334
02:52:04,639 --> 02:52:05,760
Different people now.

2335
02:52:06,479 --> 02:52:07,600
She's not.

2336
02:52:07,600 --> 02:52:09,120
And you seem just the same.

2337
02:52:09,680 --> 02:52:12,799
Well, maybe that right there's the problem.

2338
02:52:12,799 --> 02:52:14,479
She was always too good for me.

2339
02:52:15,120 --> 02:52:16,879
Let's just get you back to your sister.

2340
02:52:16,879 --> 02:52:18,639
She's waiting at the station for us.

2341
02:52:20,350 --> 02:52:21,549
Meet Mary at the station.

2342
02:52:21,549 --> 02:52:23,149
She must be waiting inside.

2343
02:52:27,200 --> 02:52:32,649
Hello.

2344
02:52:32,649 --> 02:52:34,569
Mary, I brought your son.

2345
02:52:35,530 --> 02:52:36,799
What are you going, the long way?

2346
02:52:37,440 --> 02:52:39,639
About seeing her, aren't you?

2347
02:52:39,639 --> 02:52:43,000
He's going the long way here.

2348
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:44,940
You're right.

2349
02:52:44,940 --> 02:52:46,059
Why is he limping around?

2350
02:52:46,780 --> 02:52:51,680
I seem to recall hearing mention of that myself.

2351
02:52:51,680 --> 02:52:52,239
Okay, come on.

2352
02:52:54,090 --> 02:52:55,530
All right, here's your rotten kid.

2353
02:53:04,940 --> 02:53:05,739
Because he shot his hand.

2354
02:53:05,739 --> 02:53:06,860
I didn't just shoot his hand.

2355
02:53:06,860 --> 02:53:07,819
I didn't even touch his hand.

2356
02:53:07,819 --> 02:53:08,379
It hit the gun.

2357
02:53:09,100 --> 02:53:11,020
Jamie, Jamie.

2358
02:53:11,659 --> 02:53:12,459
All right.

2359
02:53:12,459 --> 02:53:14,299
Finally, mother and son reunited.

2360
02:53:14,299 --> 02:53:15,020
Please.

2361
02:53:15,020 --> 02:53:18,139
You've father's been very sad.

2362
02:53:18,139 --> 02:53:20,780
Father wouldn't know sadness if it died in his bed.

2363
02:53:20,780 --> 02:53:21,500
He's not happy.

2364
02:53:22,299 --> 02:53:24,299
But I'll come home for you.

2365
02:53:24,299 --> 02:53:26,780
My boy, my sweet boy.

2366
02:53:27,979 --> 02:53:28,459
Come on.

2367
02:53:30,510 --> 02:53:31,309
Oh, Arthur.

2368
02:53:32,829 --> 02:53:33,309
Thank you.

2369
02:53:34,430 --> 02:53:34,989
Thank you.

2370
02:53:35,790 --> 02:53:38,139
It's good to see you, Mary.

2371
02:53:38,139 --> 02:53:39,260
And you, Arthur.

2372
02:53:39,979 --> 02:53:40,700
And you.

2373
02:53:41,659 --> 02:53:44,969
Have a good one.

2374
02:53:46,489 --> 02:53:47,209
No, don't skip.

2375
02:54:02,059 --> 02:54:02,940
Oh, you don't have to say anything.

2376
02:54:02,940 --> 02:54:06,219
I'm going to long scope you from like a half mile away when you get on the train.

2377
02:54:06,219 --> 02:54:06,860
Don't worry about it.

2378
02:54:07,739 --> 02:54:36,110
I feel like the luckiest man alive and I feel like a fool.

2379
02:54:37,389 --> 02:54:42,590
That woman confuses me and plays me for a fiddle like no one else alive.

2380
02:54:43,229 --> 02:54:47,280
I trust I will not make a god-awful fool of myself once more.

2381
02:54:47,280 --> 02:54:51,959
But somehow I imagine I shall.

2382
02:54:53,579 --> 02:54:53,979
Somehow.

2383
02:54:57,309 --> 02:54:58,270
There we go.

2384
02:54:58,270 --> 02:54:58,750
Bronze.

2385
02:54:59,629 --> 02:55:05,559
There.

2386
02:55:08,409 --> 02:55:08,649
Okay.

2387
02:55:09,690 --> 02:55:13,530
So ladies and gentlemen, I need to go take out Otto.

2388
02:55:13,530 --> 02:55:14,409
I got to get some food.

2389
02:55:15,770 --> 02:55:18,969
We've got we've been going for seven plus hours here.

2390
02:55:18,969 --> 02:55:20,329
I think it's a good stopping point.

2391
02:55:21,370 --> 02:55:23,049
Internet has held up very well.

2392
02:55:23,049 --> 02:55:24,010
What's your problem?

2393
02:55:24,010 --> 02:55:29,399
So I I'm probably just going to go tomorrow.

2394
02:55:30,120 --> 02:55:30,680
You know what I'm saying?

2395
02:55:34,040 --> 02:55:43,290
Try to keep this going because we've got.

2396
02:55:43,290 --> 02:55:46,809
Yeah, it was before I turned the stream up before I made Starplane Leap League.

2397
02:55:50,200 --> 02:55:54,190
But yeah, this looks pretty promising so far.

2398
02:55:54,989 --> 02:55:57,659
It's been very solid tonight.

2399
02:55:58,219 --> 02:56:01,899
I think it's only dropped 100 frames over six, seven hours.

2400
02:56:01,899 --> 02:56:03,020
That's pretty great, actually.

2401
02:56:04,379 --> 02:56:05,100
Show Otto.

2402
02:56:06,299 --> 02:56:06,860
I mean, hold on.

2403
02:56:06,860 --> 02:56:08,219
He's downstairs.

2404
02:56:08,219 --> 02:56:09,180
He's downstairs.

2405
02:56:09,180 --> 02:56:10,459
He's like asleep downstairs.

2406
02:56:10,459 --> 02:56:11,579
I really don't know.

2407
02:56:11,579 --> 02:56:12,940
I'm going to let him just hang out down there.

2408
02:56:13,739 --> 02:56:16,379
I don't want to like wake him up, bring him up here, and then bring him all the way.

2409
02:56:16,379 --> 02:56:21,879
No, I'll show him tomorrow with this.

2410
02:56:21,879 --> 02:56:26,920
If we still have a solid internet connection here, then tomorrow I'm just going to stream.

2411
02:56:26,920 --> 02:56:30,280
I'm going to get up, eat some food, grab coffee, and I'm just going to get going.

2412
02:56:30,280 --> 02:56:30,840
We'll just start.

2413
02:56:34,590 --> 02:56:37,069
Hopefully it's our problems are in the past.

2414
02:56:40,319 --> 02:56:42,239
Same lame excuse in Boston.

2415
02:56:42,239 --> 02:56:42,399
What?

2416
02:56:42,399 --> 02:56:43,760
Like I want to let my dog sleep.

2417
02:56:43,760 --> 02:56:46,399
I don't want to like drag him up here and like put him in front of a camera.

2418
02:56:48,329 --> 02:56:48,649
What?

2419
02:56:49,770 --> 02:56:50,010
What?

2420
02:56:52,170 --> 02:56:53,610
He's just like sleeping.

2421
02:56:53,610 --> 02:56:54,969
He's being like a good boy.

2422
02:56:57,340 --> 02:56:58,299
Excuses.

2423
02:56:58,299 --> 02:57:03,690
All right, let me, I'm going to switch off here.

2424
02:57:04,569 --> 02:57:06,010
If you're taking off, take care.

2425
02:57:06,649 --> 02:57:07,930
Hopefully we see you tomorrow.

2426
02:57:09,450 --> 02:57:10,729
I'm going to try to stream again.

2427
02:57:12,040 --> 02:57:17,549
And with that, let's run the, let's run.

2428
02:57:18,520 --> 02:57:19,239
The bits here.

2429
02:57:22,120 --> 02:57:22,680
Let's see.

2430
02:57:22,680 --> 02:57:24,120
We've got to turn this off.

2431
02:57:24,120 --> 02:57:24,760
Hey, look at that.

2432
02:57:24,760 --> 02:57:25,719
There's an outro, right?

2433
02:57:25,719 --> 02:57:26,360
That's an intro.

2434
02:57:26,360 --> 02:57:27,079
That's the wrong thing.

2435
02:57:27,079 --> 02:57:27,799
That's an outro.

2436
02:57:28,520 --> 02:57:31,069
And turn that off.

2437
02:57:31,709 --> 02:57:32,030
Okay.

2438
02:57:33,479 --> 02:57:34,680
So thanks everybody.

2439
02:57:36,270 --> 02:57:37,309
See you soon.

2440
02:57:37,309 --> 02:57:41,020
And let's get to these bits.

2441
02:57:41,020 --> 02:57:42,540
But first I need to text Kim.

2442
02:57:44,010 --> 02:57:45,370
She is asking me a question.

2443
02:57:48,889 --> 02:57:49,530
Okay.

2444
02:57:49,530 --> 02:57:50,409
Answered question.

2445
02:57:51,629 --> 02:57:54,110
So let's go back down to a long time ago here.

2446
02:57:54,110 --> 02:57:55,629
We've got this is seven hours ago.

2447
02:57:56,510 --> 02:57:57,149
DivUSP.

2448
02:57:57,149 --> 02:57:58,030
Thanks for three bucks.

2449
02:57:58,030 --> 02:57:58,670
Whoa.

2450
02:57:58,670 --> 02:57:59,549
Excuse you.

2451
02:57:59,549 --> 02:58:00,350
What the hell was that?

2452
02:58:01,309 --> 02:58:02,590
Oh, okay, that's fine.

2453
02:58:03,709 --> 02:58:04,350
DivUSP.

2454
02:58:04,350 --> 02:58:05,709
Thank you so much for the three dollars here.

2455
02:58:06,680 --> 02:58:07,239
No message.

2456
02:58:07,959 --> 02:58:09,319
Fire of unknown origin.

2457
02:58:09,319 --> 02:58:10,680
Thank you for the one dollar.

2458
02:58:10,680 --> 02:58:11,399
Jerma sucks.

2459
02:58:13,069 --> 02:58:13,950
Jext Jerma.

2460
02:58:15,600 --> 02:58:18,319
I don't, why, I did all right.

2461
02:58:18,319 --> 02:58:18,959
I did okay.

2462
02:58:21,069 --> 02:58:21,709
Tumsup.

2463
02:58:21,709 --> 02:58:22,909
Thank you Tumsup for the one dollar.

2464
02:58:22,909 --> 02:58:26,909
34 year old Kelly eats nothing but cheesy potatoes.

2465
02:58:26,909 --> 02:58:28,030
Morning, noon, and night.

2466
02:58:30,780 --> 02:58:31,899
That show is wild.

2467
02:58:31,899 --> 02:58:32,860
I can't believe it's real.

2468
02:58:33,760 --> 02:58:39,069
Sometimes I feel like they've given them like not like fake real food or something.

2469
02:58:39,709 --> 02:58:42,620
Like some people eat glass on that fucking show.

2470
02:58:42,620 --> 02:58:44,459
Like there's no way.

2471
02:58:44,459 --> 02:58:46,139
There's a guy that just eats glass.

2472
02:58:46,139 --> 02:58:46,379
What?

2473
02:58:49,340 --> 02:58:50,379
That has to be like sugar.

2474
02:58:50,379 --> 02:58:51,100
It's a joke, right?

2475
02:58:52,110 --> 02:58:52,590
No way.

2476
02:58:54,540 --> 02:58:55,340
Freaky Eaters.

2477
02:58:55,979 --> 02:58:57,479
It's on TLC.

2478
02:58:58,120 --> 02:59:01,920
A lady eats rocks in my strange addiction.

2479
02:59:01,920 --> 02:59:03,600
Lady eats rocks.

2480
02:59:04,590 --> 02:59:07,149
You watch her like bite into them and eat them.

2481
02:59:09,899 --> 02:59:10,700
It's, I don't know.

2482
02:59:10,700 --> 02:59:11,739
How is that even possible?

2483
02:59:12,700 --> 02:59:14,219
Don't you die if you eat a rock?

2484
02:59:16,639 --> 02:59:18,239
It's wild.

2485
02:59:18,239 --> 02:59:19,440
It's worth a watch though for sure.

2486
02:59:20,940 --> 02:59:23,739
Thank you Shin Pete for the one dollar.

2487
02:59:23,739 --> 02:59:24,940
Finally get to catch a Jerma stream.

2488
02:59:24,940 --> 02:59:25,500
Feels good man.

2489
02:59:25,500 --> 02:59:26,059
Hey, thank you.

2490
02:59:26,879 --> 02:59:27,440
Welcome.

2491
02:59:27,440 --> 02:59:28,079
Glad you're here.

2492
02:59:29,899 --> 02:59:31,659
Thank you Garfy of the Monday Killer for the one dollar.

2493
02:59:31,659 --> 02:59:34,059
Hey Jerma, in celebration of the hundredth Garf Buck.

2494
02:59:34,700 --> 02:59:36,940
Is it okay if Garf sings you a victory song?

2495
02:59:37,579 --> 02:59:38,219
Yeah, that's fine.

2496
02:59:39,420 --> 02:59:40,620
He lives in my scarf.

2497
02:59:40,620 --> 02:59:41,899
The twinkle in my barf.

2498
02:59:41,899 --> 02:59:43,340
He gives me what a perfect Garf.

2499
02:59:43,899 --> 02:59:46,139
At any point in time or history, Odie's done.

2500
02:59:46,139 --> 02:59:46,780
John is done.

2501
02:59:47,659 --> 02:59:48,299
Garf's the cat.

2502
02:59:48,299 --> 02:59:48,940
He's so cool.

2503
02:59:48,940 --> 02:59:49,659
He's so nice.

2504
02:59:49,659 --> 02:59:51,500
Everything about him is great.

2505
02:59:51,500 --> 02:59:52,620
Who's that flying in the sky?

2506
02:59:52,620 --> 02:59:53,340
It's GoFont.

2507
02:59:53,340 --> 02:59:55,420
It's GoFont motorcycle in the sky.

2508
02:59:55,420 --> 02:59:57,260
There he goes gorfing around in front of your face.

2509
02:59:57,260 --> 02:59:58,459
Home on a journey to outer space.

2510
02:59:58,459 --> 02:59:59,340
Oh, I get it.

2511
03:00:05,840 --> 03:00:08,159
Thank you Garfy for the Monday dollar.

2512
03:00:08,159 --> 03:00:08,719
Is it Monday?

2513
03:00:09,659 --> 03:00:10,620
No, not yet.

2514
03:00:10,620 --> 03:00:11,979
It'll be Monday in like,

2515
03:00:11,979 --> 03:00:13,659
well actually it's probably Monday for a lot of people here.

2516
03:00:13,659 --> 03:00:15,979
We're on Pacific time.

2517
03:00:16,940 --> 03:00:17,739
Thank you Garfield.

2518
03:00:19,370 --> 03:00:21,930
Thank you also to Hydra.

2519
03:00:21,930 --> 03:00:23,690
Thank you Hydra725 for the one dollar.

2520
03:00:23,690 --> 03:00:25,610
Lego Island for Evo Comedy Hour.

2521
03:00:27,129 --> 03:00:27,690
Thanks dude.

2522
03:00:28,409 --> 03:00:30,409
Tuskor13, thanks for the one dollar.

2523
03:00:31,209 --> 03:00:32,809
Honestly, I missed you two being friends.

2524
03:00:32,809 --> 03:00:34,649
These streams always make me forget my troubles.

2525
03:00:34,649 --> 03:00:35,530
Lots of love to you both.

2526
03:00:36,090 --> 03:00:36,889
That was a great time.

2527
03:00:38,010 --> 03:00:39,209
That was a lot of fun.

2528
03:00:39,209 --> 03:00:42,329
There's a couple other games that him and I both would like to play.

2529
03:00:42,969 --> 03:00:45,520
Just need to figure out how to do them.

2530
03:00:45,520 --> 03:00:46,559
Should be fun.

2531
03:00:46,559 --> 03:00:49,020
Pacific time is three hours behind.

2532
03:00:49,020 --> 03:00:49,739
Well, yeah, that's what I mean.

2533
03:00:49,739 --> 03:00:50,860
8, 9, 10, 11.

2534
03:00:50,860 --> 03:00:52,139
It's 1130 Eastern.

2535
03:00:53,180 --> 03:00:55,500
So in 30 minutes it'll be Monday.

2536
03:00:55,500 --> 03:00:56,379
Not over here though.

2537
03:00:58,510 --> 03:00:59,389
But thanks a lot Tusk.

2538
03:01:01,100 --> 03:01:03,020
Tar Alacrin, thanks for the two dollars here.

2539
03:01:03,579 --> 03:01:04,620
Dermot, you can drop the act.

2540
03:01:04,620 --> 03:01:06,459
No one believes you actually moved to Vegas.

2541
03:01:06,459 --> 03:01:09,100
It's pretty obvious you just moved your setup to a different room.

2542
03:01:09,100 --> 03:01:10,459
Closer to the Wi-Fi router.

2543
03:01:11,100 --> 03:01:15,549
Man, wouldn't that be weird?

2544
03:01:16,989 --> 03:01:18,750
Closer to the Wi-Fi router.

2545
03:01:22,120 --> 03:01:22,520
Thank you.

2546
03:01:24,360 --> 03:01:26,440
Thank you Optimus for the one dollar.

2547
03:01:26,440 --> 03:01:27,479
Optimus 27,000.

2548
03:01:28,120 --> 03:01:31,600
This stream really makes you feel like it's 2014.

2549
03:01:31,600 --> 03:01:33,360
The days of Jerma versus Star.

2550
03:01:33,360 --> 03:01:36,719
Bets, pirate spies, and demonic chefs.

2551
03:01:36,719 --> 03:01:37,659
Good to be back.

2552
03:01:39,760 --> 03:01:40,399
We never left.

2553
03:01:40,959 --> 03:01:42,280
Never left, man.

2554
03:01:42,280 --> 03:01:43,319
We're here.

2555
03:01:43,319 --> 03:01:46,399
I didn't go anywhere.

2556
03:01:46,399 --> 03:01:47,520
He didn't go anywhere.

2557
03:01:47,520 --> 03:01:49,020
It's all good.

2558
03:01:51,959 --> 03:01:54,120
Thank you 4th consecutive lion for the five dollars.

2559
03:01:55,239 --> 03:01:57,079
Damn, this stream reminded me of the good old days.

2560
03:01:57,079 --> 03:01:59,159
Hope you stream with Stirr more often.

2561
03:01:59,159 --> 03:02:01,200
I'm sure we will.

2562
03:02:01,200 --> 03:02:02,409
There's no reason not to.

2563
03:02:03,129 --> 03:02:05,209
Just need to find the right game, the right time, the right moment.

2564
03:02:05,209 --> 03:02:06,649
Organically, like I told you before.

2565
03:02:07,290 --> 03:02:10,680
There's no rhyme or reason to when I play with somebody else.

2566
03:02:10,680 --> 03:02:11,719
It just kind of happens.

2567
03:02:11,719 --> 03:02:12,840
But thanks for the five dollars, man.

2568
03:02:12,840 --> 03:02:13,239
Appreciate it.

2569
03:02:14,670 --> 03:02:15,229
Hexbred.

2570
03:02:15,229 --> 03:02:16,030
Thanks for the three dollars.

2571
03:02:16,030 --> 03:02:16,590
Hexbred.

2572
03:02:16,590 --> 03:02:17,469
It just says neat.

2573
03:02:18,110 --> 03:02:19,440
Hey, thanks.

2574
03:02:19,440 --> 03:02:22,000
Thank you Hexbred for your three bucks.

2575
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:22,639
And you're neat.

2576
03:02:23,280 --> 03:02:25,760
Moseloss.

2577
03:02:25,760 --> 03:02:27,360
Thank you Moseloss for the one dollar.

2578
03:02:27,360 --> 03:02:28,079
Great stream, Jeremy.

2579
03:02:28,079 --> 03:02:30,239
Always fun watching you and Star play Lethal League.

2580
03:02:30,239 --> 03:02:33,520
Now go watch the Patriots beat Aaron Rodgers.

2581
03:02:34,239 --> 03:02:36,219
I think I may have missed that game.

2582
03:02:36,780 --> 03:02:39,180
Yeah, that was more than three hours ago.

2583
03:02:39,180 --> 03:02:39,739
Did they win?

2584
03:02:40,459 --> 03:02:41,180
I don't know.

2585
03:02:41,739 --> 03:02:44,799
Did they win?

2586
03:02:44,799 --> 03:02:47,950
I don't really follow football.

2587
03:02:47,950 --> 03:02:49,389
I follow baseball sometimes.

2588
03:02:52,760 --> 03:02:53,399
Spoiler.

2589
03:02:53,399 --> 03:02:55,319
Oh yeah, I don't want to give spoilers.

2590
03:02:56,360 --> 03:02:57,000
Thanks a lot, man.

2591
03:02:58,200 --> 03:02:59,159
Thank you Felix.

2592
03:02:59,159 --> 03:03:00,120
Felis for the five dollars.

2593
03:03:00,120 --> 03:03:01,879
Sorry that five cents is all I can give you.

2594
03:03:02,520 --> 03:03:04,520
But I need to eat dinner tonight, Jerma.

2595
03:03:04,520 --> 03:03:05,319
Jerma Hart, buddy.

2596
03:03:06,909 --> 03:03:08,270
This is not five cents.

2597
03:03:08,270 --> 03:03:09,790
This is five dollars.

2598
03:03:11,260 --> 03:03:11,579
I don't know.

2599
03:03:11,579 --> 03:03:13,659
You may have messed up the denomination there.

2600
03:03:13,659 --> 03:03:14,219
Sorry about that.

2601
03:03:14,219 --> 03:03:16,700
But thank you for the five bucks, man.

2602
03:03:16,700 --> 03:03:17,200
Appreciate it.

2603
03:03:20,639 --> 03:03:21,200
Zalinky.

2604
03:03:21,200 --> 03:03:22,639
Thank you, Zalinky, for the one dollar.

2605
03:03:23,280 --> 03:03:23,840
No message.

2606
03:03:23,840 --> 03:03:24,319
Thank you, though.

2607
03:03:25,469 --> 03:03:26,190
Angry Ork.

2608
03:03:26,190 --> 03:03:27,549
Thanks for four bucks.

2609
03:03:27,549 --> 03:03:28,190
No message.

2610
03:03:28,190 --> 03:03:28,989
Thank you so much.

2611
03:03:30,750 --> 03:03:31,790
Rip that guy's dinner.

2612
03:03:32,959 --> 03:03:33,920
A Blue Comet.

2613
03:03:33,920 --> 03:03:36,079
Thanks for the ten dollars here, Blue Comet.

2614
03:03:36,079 --> 03:03:38,969
Ten bucks from Blue Comet.

2615
03:03:38,969 --> 03:03:40,250
Chat stole your gun.

2616
03:03:43,500 --> 03:03:49,760
You know, I like those moments where you like you.

2617
03:03:50,399 --> 03:03:52,879
I just know I'll never live it down ever again.

2618
03:03:53,600 --> 03:03:55,100
And it's live.

2619
03:03:55,979 --> 03:03:58,459
I can't like go back and fix that.

2620
03:03:58,459 --> 03:03:58,940
You know what I mean?

2621
03:04:01,399 --> 03:04:02,520
If this was YouTube, I'd be like,

2622
03:04:02,520 --> 03:04:04,440
oh, shit, that was really fucking bad.

2623
03:04:04,440 --> 03:04:06,040
That was really fucked up and stupid.

2624
03:04:06,040 --> 03:04:07,319
Oh, I was going to go delete it.

2625
03:04:08,120 --> 03:04:08,440
Nope.

2626
03:04:10,459 --> 03:04:12,940
Well, that's going to take me like a month

2627
03:04:12,940 --> 03:04:13,819
to live that one down.

2628
03:04:17,200 --> 03:04:19,040
But thank you, Blue Comet, for the ten bucks.

2629
03:04:19,040 --> 03:04:19,600
Appreciate it.

2630
03:04:20,809 --> 03:04:23,450
Little Money Larry gave fifteen dollars here.

2631
03:04:23,450 --> 03:04:24,969
Thank you so much for fifteen bucks, man.

2632
03:04:27,399 --> 03:04:28,280
You look like shit.

2633
03:04:28,280 --> 03:04:29,079
Perfect timing.

2634
03:04:29,079 --> 03:04:29,719
I snotted.

2635
03:04:29,719 --> 03:04:30,760
That was great.

2636
03:04:30,760 --> 03:04:33,559
And then they say blood for blood.

2637
03:04:34,280 --> 03:04:34,600
God.

2638
03:04:36,459 --> 03:04:36,959
What?

2639
03:04:37,180 --> 03:04:39,290
But thank you, though.

2640
03:04:41,450 --> 03:04:41,930
A month.

2641
03:04:41,930 --> 03:04:42,409
Keep dreaming.

2642
03:04:42,409 --> 03:04:43,690
It's going to take five years.

2643
03:04:46,239 --> 03:04:46,959
God.

2644
03:04:46,959 --> 03:04:50,700
He just wanted a hug.

2645
03:04:50,700 --> 03:04:51,260
I know.

2646
03:04:51,260 --> 03:04:53,180
But like the way that he reached around

2647
03:04:53,180 --> 03:04:56,139
and then like it wasn't on my back anymore.

2648
03:04:56,139 --> 03:04:56,620
And who knows?

2649
03:04:56,620 --> 03:04:58,379
There's all kinds of weird characters

2650
03:04:58,379 --> 03:04:59,979
and weird fucked up scenarios.

2651
03:04:59,979 --> 03:05:00,780
It could have happened.

2652
03:05:03,899 --> 03:05:05,899
Chat is still on Coffee Cheetos Chicken.

2653
03:05:05,899 --> 03:05:06,940
What are you on about?

2654
03:05:07,739 --> 03:05:08,459
Oh, that's right.

2655
03:05:10,440 --> 03:05:12,520
Okay, so that one, if Coffee Cheetos Chicken,

2656
03:05:12,520 --> 03:05:15,559
like finally like like at the end of its life,

2657
03:05:15,719 --> 03:05:16,920
two years from now is done,

2658
03:05:16,920 --> 03:05:18,120
then this one's going to be ten years.

2659
03:05:19,549 --> 03:05:20,190
I just said it.

2660
03:05:20,989 --> 03:05:22,270
Now it just resets the time.

2661
03:05:22,270 --> 03:05:24,110
So like I just gave it another five years.

2662
03:05:24,909 --> 03:05:27,280
Every time it's mentioned, the clock resets.

2663
03:05:31,360 --> 03:05:34,319
And then at the end here, thank you Snatchy for the one dollar.

2664
03:05:35,040 --> 03:05:36,479
I bet she's going to meet all the other people

2665
03:05:36,479 --> 03:05:37,840
you've helped in the afterlife.

2666
03:05:37,840 --> 03:05:38,639
Mentioned that before.

2667
03:05:38,639 --> 03:05:40,000
That's a funny, that was a funny comment.

2668
03:05:40,799 --> 03:05:43,200
And in the very end, thank you E Cookie for the one dollar.

2669
03:05:44,829 --> 03:05:48,030
Can you watch and react to your 500 subscriber special?

2670
03:05:48,989 --> 03:05:51,549
No, I've done, I've done it like three times.

2671
03:05:52,809 --> 03:05:53,370
I can't.

2672
03:05:54,170 --> 03:05:56,569
You want it?

2673
03:05:56,569 --> 03:05:57,450
No, I'm not.

2674
03:05:57,450 --> 03:05:58,729
I'm not going to give any ideas.

2675
03:05:59,450 --> 03:06:02,680
I'm going to close my mouth on that one.

2676
03:06:05,040 --> 03:06:05,520
You want it?

2677
03:06:05,520 --> 03:06:06,319
You wanted me to watch?

2678
03:06:06,319 --> 03:06:07,120
You want me to watch that?

2679
03:06:09,879 --> 03:06:10,440
Hmm.

2680
03:06:10,440 --> 03:06:11,799
I wonder how that would be possible.

2681
03:06:12,440 --> 03:06:18,430
Oh, I'm not, I don't know.

2682
03:06:20,360 --> 03:06:22,920
Guys, the old shitty annotations about

2683
03:06:22,920 --> 03:06:24,840
me correcting the amount of pounds it is.

2684
03:06:25,559 --> 03:06:27,000
These are 35 pound dumbbells.

2685
03:06:27,000 --> 03:06:27,639
It's 30 actually.

2686
03:06:27,639 --> 03:06:28,520
I'm sorry, I lied.

2687
03:06:29,959 --> 03:06:34,909
Those annotations are still there.

2688
03:06:34,909 --> 03:06:36,270
But that's it for the bits.

2689
03:06:36,270 --> 03:06:42,719
Thank you everybody for your monetary contributions.

2690
03:06:42,719 --> 03:06:43,680
Thanks to the bits, everybody.

2691
03:06:44,239 --> 03:06:44,959
You guys all rock.

2692
03:06:45,920 --> 03:06:48,079
And let's go ahead and throw the credits up on the screen.

2693
03:06:48,879 --> 03:06:50,399
I got a feeling it's going to be a lot.

2694
03:06:50,399 --> 03:06:51,920
It's going to probably be going real fast.

2695
03:06:53,280 --> 03:06:56,000
But thank you regardless to everybody that subscribes to the channel.

2696
03:06:56,000 --> 03:06:56,879
You guys are all amazing.

2697
03:06:57,959 --> 03:06:58,680
And here it comes.

2698
03:07:01,870 --> 03:07:03,389
Thank you for supporting the stream.

2699
03:07:03,389 --> 03:07:04,030
All you guys.

2700
03:07:04,829 --> 03:07:09,149
I just, I locked up when I looked at it.

2701
03:07:09,149 --> 03:07:10,030
Fucking god damn it, man.

2702
03:07:11,149 --> 03:07:12,030
It's been a long time.

2703
03:07:12,989 --> 03:07:13,549
Thank you.

2704
03:07:14,350 --> 03:07:15,950
I just was staring at the webcam.

2705
03:07:15,950 --> 03:07:16,989
That's why I don't do webcam.

2706
03:07:17,959 --> 03:07:24,719
If the webcam was on, thank you everybody.

2707
03:07:26,959 --> 03:07:27,840
I went like this.

2708
03:07:27,840 --> 03:07:28,799
No, I'm not going to turn it on yet.

2709
03:07:28,799 --> 03:07:30,479
I want to see everybody.

2710
03:07:32,299 --> 03:07:33,180
You guys are all amazing.

2711
03:07:33,739 --> 03:07:35,879
Hello tall streamer.

2712
03:07:35,879 --> 03:07:36,360
Thanks, man.

2713
03:07:41,799 --> 03:07:43,239
Why is my music not on?

2714
03:07:43,239 --> 03:07:45,850
What the fuck?

2715
03:07:45,850 --> 03:07:47,049
So what was the green screen update?

2716
03:07:47,049 --> 03:07:47,530
I missed it.

2717
03:07:49,040 --> 03:07:51,040
After we, I will reiterate it one more time.

2718
03:07:53,600 --> 03:07:59,770
But don't want to give the subs some time to go by here.

2719
03:08:04,829 --> 03:08:05,309
All of you.

2720
03:08:08,299 --> 03:08:18,889
When I came back actually streaming three days or so, it was later like 300 or 400 subs.

2721
03:08:19,690 --> 03:08:26,360
Were a lot of you guys just like saving it to when I actually came back?

2722
03:08:26,360 --> 03:08:29,799
At what point were you like, okay, I'm going to wait until he comes back.

2723
03:08:30,360 --> 03:08:31,639
He ain't, he ain't back.

2724
03:08:32,440 --> 03:08:33,639
What the fuck is he doing?

2725
03:08:38,649 --> 03:08:42,090
People remember like October, like all of October.

2726
03:08:42,090 --> 03:08:45,290
I barely stream just because of all this, you know, moving and everything.

2727
03:08:45,290 --> 03:08:48,329
And I, people still paid for that whole month of subscriptions.

2728
03:08:49,680 --> 03:08:50,319
Tons of you guys.

2729
03:08:50,879 --> 03:08:54,780
So then I didn't really do very much.

2730
03:08:54,780 --> 03:08:57,149
So thank you for your patience.

2731
03:09:00,239 --> 03:09:05,020
Thanks for continuing to support the stream, even when the stream and even turned on.

2732
03:09:05,020 --> 03:09:19,760
So that means a lot, but it seems like we are back in the saddle.

2733
03:09:20,940 --> 03:09:24,059
Judging by all the testing that we did yesterday and then today,

2734
03:09:25,979 --> 03:09:27,579
let's hope that it's a done deal.

2735
03:09:28,620 --> 03:09:34,239
I can't afford it every month.

2736
03:09:35,360 --> 03:09:36,399
You don't have to be subbed, man.

2737
03:09:37,200 --> 03:09:39,079
Make sure you take care of yourself first.

2738
03:09:39,079 --> 03:09:44,760
Make sure that anything that you give to me is something that you can afford.

2739
03:09:44,760 --> 03:09:47,399
Something that it's, you are completely comfortable doing.

2740
03:09:48,280 --> 03:09:51,530
Oh shit, it auto subbed.

2741
03:09:51,530 --> 03:09:52,809
Can I get a free fund?

2742
03:09:56,620 --> 03:09:57,500
That was a lot of people.

2743
03:10:00,000 --> 03:10:00,719
Thank you so much.

2744
03:10:01,280 --> 03:10:06,520
I'm a poor university student.

2745
03:10:06,520 --> 03:10:10,280
I can't afford something, which is why I look forward to survey bits to show my support.

2746
03:10:11,239 --> 03:10:12,680
That's perfectly fine, man.

2747
03:10:12,680 --> 03:10:13,719
Thank you for even doing that.

2748
03:10:18,959 --> 03:10:23,280
There's no obligation for you to continuously give me money.

2749
03:10:24,920 --> 03:10:26,920
I appreciate anything that you would even say.

2750
03:10:28,799 --> 03:10:29,440
So thank you.

2751
03:10:31,260 --> 03:10:32,059
Triple Jupiter.

2752
03:10:32,059 --> 03:10:32,540
Holy shit.

2753
03:10:34,840 --> 03:10:35,559
That likes it, man.

2754
03:10:35,559 --> 03:10:36,040
You got it.

2755
03:10:36,760 --> 03:10:38,459
What's all this facing here though?

2756
03:10:38,459 --> 03:10:40,299
Is that an emote problem?

2757
03:10:41,260 --> 03:10:42,219
Oh no, is it dash?

2758
03:10:42,219 --> 03:10:42,719
Okay.

2759
03:10:43,920 --> 03:10:45,680
Only a few days until Hitman 2.

2760
03:10:45,680 --> 03:10:46,479
Well, I'd better.

2761
03:10:47,920 --> 03:10:49,440
Oh, so many things to do.

2762
03:10:49,440 --> 03:10:50,879
There's so much to do.

2763
03:10:50,879 --> 03:10:52,879
This is what happens when you don't stream for a month.

2764
03:10:53,600 --> 03:10:54,799
So many fucking things come out.

2765
03:10:54,799 --> 03:10:57,280
So many things that I have been backlogged.

2766
03:11:00,110 --> 03:11:01,549
The end of the year here will be a lot of fun.

2767
03:11:02,110 --> 03:11:03,209
There's a lot to do.

2768
03:11:04,159 --> 03:11:06,159
But I am going to take off.

2769
03:11:06,159 --> 03:11:08,079
Right at the very end, mostly loss came in with the dollar.

2770
03:11:08,079 --> 03:11:09,920
Oops, this was the last dollar in my bank account.

2771
03:11:09,920 --> 03:11:10,879
Whoa, that's not good.

2772
03:11:11,840 --> 03:11:12,959
Whoa, thank you though.

2773
03:11:14,479 --> 03:11:16,079
Timmy Tim Tam, thanks for the one dollar.

2774
03:11:17,319 --> 03:11:19,079
Your special stream, return my heart.

2775
03:11:20,729 --> 03:11:22,250
And this is an image of me.

2776
03:11:24,239 --> 03:11:25,440
Oh, what?

2777
03:11:27,930 --> 03:11:28,329
Why is...

2778
03:11:30,989 --> 03:11:32,110
I was supposed to be eating the microphone.

2779
03:11:32,110 --> 03:11:32,430
Okay.

2780
03:11:33,309 --> 03:11:34,670
Why does it just link that?

2781
03:11:34,670 --> 03:11:35,469
I just linked that.

2782
03:11:35,469 --> 03:11:36,190
Why did I do that?

2783
03:11:38,040 --> 03:11:38,680
I...

2784
03:11:38,680 --> 03:11:39,639
Whatever.

2785
03:11:39,639 --> 03:11:41,319
Thank you E-Cookie for the one dollar at the end here.

2786
03:11:41,319 --> 03:11:43,079
Do 4,000 subs special.

2787
03:11:44,510 --> 03:11:45,790
A fourth like on Twitch?

2788
03:11:46,590 --> 03:11:49,290
I don't have 4,000 subs on Twitch.

2789
03:11:49,370 --> 03:11:51,370
If that's what you're referring to.

2790
03:11:54,639 --> 03:11:55,680
But thank you.

2791
03:11:55,680 --> 03:11:57,500
It came pretty close.

2792
03:11:57,500 --> 03:12:00,540
There was like a month or two ago.

2793
03:12:00,540 --> 03:12:01,739
Like before I moved.

2794
03:12:02,540 --> 03:12:03,340
Holy shit.

2795
03:12:04,379 --> 03:12:06,059
I think we got real close to it.

2796
03:12:06,059 --> 03:12:07,659
Maybe we went over for one day or something.

2797
03:12:11,819 --> 03:12:15,200
But and that's just fucking out of this world.

2798
03:12:15,200 --> 03:12:16,079
I can't even imagine that.

2799
03:12:16,959 --> 03:12:18,719
But how do you check my subs?

2800
03:12:19,520 --> 03:12:23,790
I think it has 3,900.

2801
03:12:23,790 --> 03:12:25,709
I did not have 3,900.

2802
03:12:25,709 --> 03:12:30,879
That was during the spicy move.

2803
03:12:32,719 --> 03:12:33,840
Hey, why are you ending the stream?

2804
03:12:33,840 --> 03:12:34,879
I just got here asshole.

2805
03:12:34,879 --> 03:12:35,920
Hey, whoa, man.

2806
03:12:36,959 --> 03:12:38,719
Oh my goodness.

2807
03:12:39,520 --> 03:12:40,319
What the hell is it?

2808
03:12:40,319 --> 03:12:42,719
Hey, you got like an eight hour VOD that's ready to go.

2809
03:12:43,520 --> 03:12:45,920
And hey, that was two full different games here.

2810
03:12:45,920 --> 03:12:48,159
It was me and Stirr playing Lethal League.

2811
03:12:48,159 --> 03:12:48,959
Which was a lot of fun.

2812
03:12:48,959 --> 03:12:50,479
And then some Red Dead Redemption 2.

2813
03:12:50,479 --> 03:12:52,399
Man, you got like eight hours here, man.

2814
03:12:54,079 --> 03:12:55,040
Permaband, no.

2815
03:12:56,079 --> 03:12:56,399
All right.

2816
03:12:56,399 --> 03:12:57,360
I will see you guys tomorrow.

2817
03:12:57,360 --> 03:12:58,319
Oh, Garfield here.

2818
03:12:58,319 --> 03:12:59,120
Garfield the Monday Kill.

2819
03:12:59,120 --> 03:13:00,239
Thanks for the one dollar Garfield.

2820
03:13:01,200 --> 03:13:03,280
I made a comic for you and for Holymac.

2821
03:13:03,760 --> 03:13:04,479
Let's see what it is.

2822
03:13:08,600 --> 03:13:09,799
Good morning, Holymac.

2823
03:13:09,799 --> 03:13:10,360
All right.

2824
03:13:11,079 --> 03:13:12,040
Good morning to you.

2825
03:13:13,209 --> 03:13:14,329
Pushito.

2826
03:13:14,329 --> 03:13:15,290
Who the fuck is this?

2827
03:13:15,290 --> 03:13:16,889
Love me, love my mask.

2828
03:13:16,889 --> 03:13:17,370
What is this?

2829
03:13:21,930 --> 03:13:24,329
I saw a guy call you bad earlier and you banned him.

2830
03:13:25,290 --> 03:13:27,049
Well, I mean, for those of you that are new to the channel,

2831
03:13:29,450 --> 03:13:32,010
the permanent ban, a life ban.

2832
03:13:32,889 --> 03:13:36,170
If I denominate a permanent life ban, it's 15 seconds.

2833
03:13:37,049 --> 03:13:38,809
That's a life sentence.

2834
03:13:38,809 --> 03:13:41,290
So if you're new to the channel, that's what happens.

2835
03:13:42,010 --> 03:13:47,790
Trevor doesn't know how to read.

2836
03:13:54,969 --> 03:13:56,489
Find some treasure next time.

2837
03:13:56,489 --> 03:13:58,010
Yeah, we'll do some side content tomorrow.

2838
03:14:01,100 --> 03:14:02,459
I will try to find some treasures.

2839
03:14:02,459 --> 03:14:03,500
We'll do some hunting.

2840
03:14:04,219 --> 03:14:07,440
I'll try to start at some point in the afternoon.

2841
03:14:07,440 --> 03:14:10,479
Again, like I've said before, the schedule is just throw it out the window for now.

2842
03:14:11,760 --> 03:14:20,000
Until I have the 100% all clear that the internet is 100% fixed and ready to go,

2843
03:14:20,719 --> 03:14:22,000
I still don't have that information.

2844
03:14:22,639 --> 03:14:27,040
The Cox tech guy that I've been talking to has been all over it and on top of it.

2845
03:14:27,040 --> 03:14:30,959
Well, there's no confirmation here yet that, oh, hey, by the way, it's actually done.

2846
03:14:31,920 --> 03:14:34,719
Once that's done and once that's completely, we're in the complete clear,

2847
03:14:35,520 --> 03:14:36,479
I'm going to have a new schedule.

2848
03:14:36,479 --> 03:14:38,670
So we'll figure it out.

2849
03:14:40,120 --> 03:14:41,159
Have a great rest of your night, guys.

2850
03:14:41,159 --> 03:14:41,559
Take care.

2851
03:14:42,200 --> 03:14:45,959
I'm going to go eat food, let my dog out and say hello to my girlfriend.

2852
03:14:46,760 --> 03:14:48,360
I think she's downstairs.

2853
03:14:49,319 --> 03:14:50,569
Take care, guys.

2854
03:14:50,569 --> 03:14:51,370
Have a great rest of your night.

2855
03:15:10,649 --> 03:15:11,049
Bye.
