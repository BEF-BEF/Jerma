1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:07,459
Alright, this one we're playing is Stay Out of the House, which I'm saving this one for probably

2
00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:24,920
the last one I do today, because this is probably going to send me into another dimension.

3
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:56,280
Alright, volume. What am I doing about the volume here? How low should I make it?

4
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:04,709
Is it one of those scenarios where this should be like 20%, like 10%? I currently have it at like

5
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:20,599
30% right now. We'll see. 7%. Alright, should I keep? What should I do here? Keep it at

6
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:52,260
turn it off? VHS? CRT off? VHS on? Or everything off? Alright, let's get a poll actually. I feel

7
00:01:52,260 --> 00:02:11,419
like people are... Alright, am I doing filters on or filters off? On or off? Let's see. Alright,

8
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:20,620
poll. It seems to be on or off. Is it to turn all these filters on or turn at least one or two of

9
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:38,699
them on? It's literally a two minute poll. Just yes or no. 1999 is kind of scary. Off is winning by

10
00:02:38,699 --> 00:03:02,150
a lot. Okay. Well, not a lot, but keep the CRT on. Off is winning by a pretty large margin now.

11
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:07,689
Okay, you guys ready? Let's go. Part one, the night shift. Medium. You might not make it out

12
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:20,949
alive. That's fine. Take the night shift. Yes. Volume is down. Here we go. By the way, I have

13
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:25,030
not been looking forward to this at all. When I knew this came out, I was pissed because I knew

14
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:31,750
I was going to have to play it eventually. I'm pissed off for doing this game up. I need to

15
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:48,069
change the game. Stay out of the house. Here we go. Okay. Want me to pick you up? Yeah, it's too

16
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:57,050
far to walk. Yeah, pick me up. Yeah, it's too far to walk. As if. I'll be conked out by then.

17
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:35,500
I'll have a beer for you later. Have fun. Just in time. Hurry up and punch in. I've got a hot day

18
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:51,939
tonight. Can I play this? Bullshit. You wish. I played this, didn't I? Come on, I've got to go.

19
00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:01,699
Did you sweep the floor at least? It's a different game. Oh, okay. Sorry, dude. I was too busy. Hey,

20
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:08,060
Rick left Alyssa's side work to do on your shift. Now I've got to get out of here. Oh yeah, one more

21
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:15,160
thing. I can't find the keys anywhere. The bathrooms are locked up. So go behind the dumpster, I guess.

22
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,800
Have a good date. First part is the same. If my calculations are correct, I'll be running

23
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:35,610
third base of one hour and 16.32 seconds. Yeah, I played this. The prologue is the same. Oh,

24
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:43,079
all right. I remember. Yeah, I remember what happens here. This was the worst scare I've ever

25
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:48,730
had in my entire life, I believe. I remember it. It's the prologue. Should I just skip it then?

26
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:54,490
Should I just go to the second part? Or just do it and get it over with? Yeah, this was the worst

27
00:05:54,490 --> 00:06:03,110
scare in my entire life. Just do it again. Oh, all right. Fine. All right. Well, you have to do like

28
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:42,939
tasks, right? Oh my god. I gotta turn the FOV down, I think. I gotta clock in. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

29
00:06:42,939 --> 00:07:35,189
This tasks, right? I have to like sweep the floor and take out the trash. Turn the CRT off. Nice.

30
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:59,160
Okay, that's fun. All right. Where's the, where's my stuff I gotta do? Don't have to like mop shit

31
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:09,029
the dumpster out back. Yeah. Do I have to, I can't, how do I get out of here? Is there a key I can't

32
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:18,600
on the wall or something, right? I just don't remember. Okay. Um, yeah, here it is. Okay.

33
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:25,290
Do better job on the side work. Make sure to be finished when I come back. Okay. Sweep the floors,

34
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:28,970
place items that weren't purchased back where they belong and clean the bathrooms. Yeah. Okay.

35
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:35,620
So the items I have to replace which are not supposed to be in the right and different spot,

36
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:49,100
right? To move them on the wrong shelf. Let's see what it looks like with this off. That's way better.

37
00:08:49,100 --> 00:09:01,669
I can actually look at this now. Okay. It's the broom. Thank you. Finally, finally, finally. All

38
00:09:01,669 --> 00:09:10,940
right. All right. Uh, the broom is back here somewhere. There it is. All right. Sweep the

39
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:31,580
floors. They make you do all this because the game just makes you do a bunch of boring stuff

40
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:48,899
and then it just fucking screams in your face. We've seen this before. Don't spoil the whole

41
00:09:48,899 --> 00:10:28,970
collection. I've already streamed this exact game though. There's a customer come. Hello. Hi. Can you

42
00:10:28,970 --> 00:11:15,529
give me $10 on pump five? Yeah. Thanks. What's it? Can I help you? Can you turn the goddamn pump on?

43
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:48,009
Sorry, sir. Okay. Sweeping is done. Now I got to put these items back where they belong. So this is

44
00:11:48,009 --> 00:12:01,460
a beer motor oil and chips. Okay. So chips go in the chips aisle, which is, there's a chip here.

45
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:22,740
Is this chips? Well, this is, it goes in here. Where's the gas go? Oh, okay. Here we go. Yeah.

46
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:52,980
Extra cases of, yeah. How do I put it in? All right. Put this down. Okay. I'll put it back.

47
00:12:52,980 --> 00:13:07,129
It looks like this is where it goes. Oh, there we go. Okay. Um, so where do I put the beer or the

48
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:21,259
drink? I would think like right here. Yeah. And then this, this is oil now and motor oil.

49
00:13:25,450 --> 00:14:06,500
Right here somewhere. Yeah. Yeah. Clean the bathrooms. All right. Okay. Here we go. It's

50
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:31,669
time. Everybody knows what's coming. Here it comes. Here we go. Where's the, it's happening.

51
00:14:31,669 --> 00:14:52,470
Where is it? How do I get out of here? Where's the key? He's going to get scared again. I mean,

52
00:14:52,470 --> 00:15:09,259
probably. I remember. I remember what happens, but I need to just be able to go to the,

53
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:46,970
to do the dumpster. Where's the key? There's a customer. Hi. Can I help you? Yeah. I just

54
00:15:46,970 --> 00:16:00,139
need some cigarette. Okay. Okay. Which brand? Banshee red with filters. There you go. Thanks.

55
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:14,059
Oh, Hey, can I use the bathroom? I can't open it. Well, that's weird. Good luck. Thanks for the

56
00:16:14,059 --> 00:17:11,430
money. Okay. Now, what if I get the key? Can't leave the store. I'm going to try so hard to not

57
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:18,700
have the jumpscare do anything. I'm going to try as hard as I can for all the people that are

58
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,900
trickling in. They're going to be like, what is wrong with this guy? Is he on like drugs? Like,

59
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:44,920
why did he not even react? I'm going to try to just be like this, try to, no, not going to happen.

60
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,779
All right. Do a poll. When the jumpscare happens, will I do a, any reaction at all? Yes or no?

61
00:17:54,470 --> 00:18:01,900
Let's bet. I'm going to, I'm seriously going to try. I know when the jumpscare happens,

62
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:22,980
I'm going to desperately try, uh, do a bet. Will I show any emotion during the jumpscare? Yes or no?

63
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:36,069
That's easy money. Well, let's see, put your money where your mouth is then. I know precisely when

64
00:18:36,069 --> 00:19:39,259
it happens to all in, this is going to be close 20 million versus 12 million points.

65
00:19:39,259 --> 00:20:03,640
Please don't react. I will try. Okay. It's locked in. Um, how do I proceed the game?

66
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:13,019
It has to be absolutely no reaction. I'm talking about this like that. I'm just going to go like

67
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:40,150
this. All right. Okay. Like this. Am I missing something here? Am I, am I not pressing a button

68
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:57,450
to keep this going? I think I have to play the arcade game. All right. It's coming soon.

69
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:16,710
Yeah, I did play this before. This apparently is the prologue to the new one. So that doesn't

70
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,829
count. That's not, that does not count. That's not what we're talking about. Don't do not pay

71
00:21:19,829 --> 00:21:26,680
anybody up. Don't pay anybody. Nobody gets paid at all. We're not doing that because that's not

72
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:43,049
what I was talking about. That does not count. That's not the jumpscare. Nope. I didn't say

73
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:54,490
a jumpscare. I said the jumpscare. No, it doesn't count. That does not count. Dude, I'm dead now.

74
00:21:54,490 --> 00:22:40,940
All right. Where's this key? Here it is. Please pretend like you've never played before. Yeah,

75
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:52,599
I will. Somebody's coming in. There's a customer. Okay. Hi, you're here all alone. No, no, my

76
00:22:52,599 --> 00:24:16,009
coworkers in the back. What are you getting? Oh, could you help me? I don't remember where the

77
00:24:16,009 --> 00:24:21,140
sodas are. This whole thing looks the same. Every aisle is the same with items on it.

78
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,259
It's hard for me to understand where I am. You ever played a level with cement on it?

79
00:24:25,940 --> 00:25:04,680
I get you, man. I do. Thank you. So what even happens in this game? Wait, oops. Don't tell

80
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:43,849
them. Nobody tell them. Okay. How do I open this? Read the note. I've already done everything.

81
00:25:43,849 --> 00:25:47,690
I swept the floors. I placed the items where in the end and I just need to clean the bathroom.

82
00:25:47,690 --> 00:26:02,119
But you need the key to do that. Where's the key? Put the volume up. Volume up? It's going to be

83
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:06,200
probably really loud. I don't know if I want to do that. Volume up. Are you sure about that? Be

84
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:14,119
aware. This could get loud. What was that sound? Something's here. Okay. That was weird sound.

85
00:26:14,119 --> 00:27:09,160
Okay. I need to find cleaner. Okay. Nothing special. I did not react. That was zero reaction.

86
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:23,259
Zero. I win. He blinked. Okay. Here we go. Now we're in the game.

87
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:50,069
You died so someone else could live. That's crucifixion now. Amen. Amen.

88
00:27:50,069 --> 00:28:35,430
You've reacted. Wait, are we playing the game? Turn it up or turn it down? Just be aware of

89
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:54,839
these games are loud and like adjust your volume accordingly. Seriously. How long have I been out?

90
00:28:54,839 --> 00:29:46,440
Was he not back yet? You in there? You're good. Having some trouble with the door. Hold on.

91
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:42,869
Oh, I can turn this down. Don't. Coward. I'm just saying the game is loud as fuck and I'm telling

92
00:30:42,869 --> 00:31:04,259
you I'm warning you for real. Lower your volume. Okay. It's a point where it hurts your ears.

93
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:10,170
I'm going to. Okay. I'm saving everybody. I'm bringing the jumpscares down to like

94
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:37,000
60% 50%. I'm just telling you. Let me see how loud that is. I'll turn the master volume up.

95
00:31:37,000 --> 00:32:23,619
Actually, I don't want to do. Don't play the game. Seems like someone lost this. What is that doing?

96
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:43,140
Beginning of this upcoming month, all work and productions conducted at the Crawford mill will

97
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:48,220
cease to continue due to a lack of business over the past year. The owners unfortunately cannot

98
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:53,849
afford to keep the mill open and running. Therefore will be condemned and sold to the state. They'll

99
00:32:53,849 --> 00:33:03,130
repurpose the building or demolish it. Okay. His wife will be moving away from Cedarville in hopes

100
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:06,890
to find a better treatment center close to the city. He sends his deepest apologies to all

101
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:10,650
employees who have dedicated their time and efforts toward the betterment of the company.

102
00:33:10,650 --> 00:34:22,599
Okay. Creepy dog. Hi dog. What's up? Wow. That's a lot. Something bad is going to happen to the dog.

103
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:28,260
I already know it and it's going to be so sad and it's going to be, I'm going to be pissed.

104
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:58,780
Yep. Something bad is going to happen to the dog. Lala. I can't get through this. Okay. So let's

105
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:48,230
just go and go this way. Is a child a teddy bear glasses? Whose dog is this? This is a briefcase.

106
00:35:48,230 --> 00:36:10,699
God plug it. Hey, hey, hey. Okay. You're not going to give me a goddamn cornfield to go through.

107
00:36:10,699 --> 00:36:55,820
Are you? Dead end. Yeah. God damn it. All right. I can remember that's there. Okay. I just got to

108
00:36:55,820 --> 00:38:13,400
go through it. All right, dog. You and me into the cornfield. Oh, it hurts to do this too. Oh,

109
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,349
what's dog going? Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Where are you going?

110
00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:24,519
Where are you going? What are you eating? Don't eat. Don't eat stuff you find on the ground.

111
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:39,179
What are you doing? Don't eat stuff on the ground. We're all parishioners. Okay. Assembly of God of

112
00:38:39,179 --> 00:38:44,070
some unfortunately sudden and upcoming changes to our standards of curriculum. Being sad with a

113
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:52,599
heavy heart, our family of religious followers have turned elsewhere. There are a few who, okay.

114
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:56,679
They're not following the Bible and it is my understanding that their syllabus is full of

115
00:38:56,679 --> 00:39:01,099
nonsensical gibberish. I don't know who of what they are worshiping, but friends and colleagues

116
00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:12,739
of mine have started to treat me as a stranger. Holy shit. Last night while eating with my family,

117
00:39:12,739 --> 00:39:17,980
a bullet was fired through my kitchen window. It barely missed my head. It has completely

118
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:26,570
obliterated one of my favorite paintings given to me by one of my choir members. I'll be leaving

119
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:31,849
town. I do not wish to leave, but feel as if I have no choice. And I'd advise anyone who still

120
00:39:31,849 --> 00:39:36,789
comes to our church to join me towards our new place of hope and prosperity. Thank you for your

121
00:39:36,789 --> 00:40:01,460
kindness and understanding. Stop. Don't, don't eat that. Don't eat that. Where's the dog? Where's

122
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:25,460
the dog? Come over here. Don't waste it. Keep staying with me, please. This way. I don't think

123
00:40:25,460 --> 00:41:16,699
he wants to come with me. Where's the dog? What should I do? Is there another way to go?

124
00:41:20,059 --> 00:41:34,889
Through the cornfield? There has to be another way to go. Okay. Thank God that was you.

125
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:41,610
Uh, I'm going this way. Uh, uh, huh? What? Okay. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. Oh shit. Okay.

126
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:58,340
Good find. What have we? Shirt? What is this? An ID? Weird. What happened here? ID? Our mission,

129

yourself and the Lord, either at one of our many days of worship in person or via weekly tapes,

130
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:19,670
which will be delivered to your doorstep. We seek to spread the message of God across the

131
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:24,389

waiting for us all. Our pastor, Dr. James F. Buu, is an authentic server of God since early

140
00:44:32,809 --> 00:45:24,179
towards righteousness. Anything else I can grab here? A dress? Check under the car? Did I touch

141
00:45:24,179 --> 00:46:07,480
everything? I think I see everything, right? What are you looking at? I'm just going to leave. I

142
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:50,070
don't know what way to go. I think I'm going the other way that I just came. I think I came from

143
00:46:50,070 --> 00:47:05,210
this way. Dog check. Yeah, this is the church. Is there any other way I can go? Shit, this is

144
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:49,110
where the church is. This is nothing here. Is there a direction down here I didn't go? Cement game,

145
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:56,630
but it's made out of corn instead. True. All right. I don't think I went this way.

146
00:48:23,420 --> 00:49:03,480
I don't like it. The name of this game is stay out of the house.

147
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:30,710
Why would I go in the house? Where's the dog? I don't know what to do. No, no, no, no, no, no,

148
00:49:30,710 --> 00:50:14,889
don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. No. Where am I? I'm trying to find you. Where is he?

149
00:50:14,889 --> 00:50:58,179
What kind of weird house is this? Why is it? No. Upstairs? Where is he? He is down here. Where?

150
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:17,849
No. Are you okay? How do I help? Please, please, please, please. How do I help? I need to help.

151
00:51:17,849 --> 00:51:28,099
You okay? No, no. Bad idea. Bad idea. Really bad idea. Bad idea. Bad idea. What?

152
00:51:28,099 --> 00:52:49,780
What? It was a bait. It was bait. It was literally bait. I'm taking these up. That was the soap.

153
00:52:49,780 --> 00:53:09,099
It was bait. It was a Halloween decoration. Should have stayed out of the house, dude.

154
00:53:09,099 --> 00:53:49,559
This is going to suck. My stomach. What did he do? What's this for? This is going to be a granny

155
00:53:49,559 --> 00:54:04,570
game. This is a grandma game. Otherwise I can't do these ones. I can't do grandma games. I pitched

156
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:45,380
sounds. Is it better? Be quiet. All right. Get me out of here. I think this is like a lamp with

157
00:54:45,380 --> 00:56:28,409
skin. How do I get the fuck out of here? Heal the cage back. Upper back corner. What do I just do?

158
00:56:28,409 --> 00:56:51,480
Turn light on. Fuck you. Oh, fuck you. Don't even. Hold on. Can I do anything over here?

159
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:55,019
I just filled that with gas? What the fuck is in here? It's a clock. Dude, where should I put it?

160
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:16,360
Light meter? It's set to nine o'clock. Should I remember that? Okay. Nine o'clock. Toolbox is

161
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:41,079
locked. Where should I bring this? I don't know. Just turn all the lights on maybe first. There's

162
00:58:41,079 --> 00:59:08,119
another way to go. I'm going to bring that into here. The clock. He hates. What'd you say? I'm

163
00:59:08,119 --> 00:59:23,639
really not. Honestly, I'm really not good at granny likes. Oh, fuck you. Night shift abductors

164
00:59:23,639 --> 00:59:35,989
strikes again. Granny likes. Yeah. So what a granny like is a game where you is a game where

165
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:42,230
you have to pick up like rope. Bring the rope downstairs to grab that thing. When you grab that

166
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:46,070
thing, there's bubble gum in it. You take the bubble gum up to the room upstairs and put it

167
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:50,710
under the sink to plug the hole. Then you can get the water with the cup that you have to find down

168
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:55,190
in the basement, which you can only get there if you open the door with the key that you find

169
00:59:55,190 --> 01:00:09,610
underneath the bed. I'm not good at granny likes. 34 year old Deborah is the latest victim of the

170
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:18,300
notorious night shift abductor relocation show video evidence of the same abductor

171
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:21,099
at multiple locations between Custer County and its surrounding areas.

172
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:26,380
All six abductions have had very similar circumstances. He was alone in the shift

173
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:30,139
in the dead of night was confronted by the assailant after a period of observation

174
01:00:30,139 --> 01:00:44,360
when the venue was at a period of little to no business. Okay. Okay. He's mid to late 30s

175
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:49,400
standing at roughly six four and assumed 250 pounds. Very few other details of the assailant

176
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:54,119
are known. His identity as well as concealed during the assault via a makeshift burlap mask

177
01:00:54,119 --> 01:01:09,500
and thick seasonal clothing. Okay. Okay. These incidents do not appear to be slowing down

178
01:01:10,219 --> 01:01:14,219
much longer. Are we to expect this to the slow unproductive case to continue?

179
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:35,860
You better not start. You're going to start moving. Aren't you paperclip? Thank you. Valley

180
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:41,059
cover versus brand new lock has a preset code, which cannot be changed. We would advise storing

181
01:01:41,059 --> 01:01:53,610
this paper. So, okay. Combination is four question mark 62 or something six two. All right. That's

182
01:01:53,610 --> 01:02:31,269
for the padlock that was in the other room or something. Oh my God. No, or something six two.

183
01:02:31,269 --> 01:02:47,269
Let's brute force it. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. What do I do? What? How do I turn it off?

184
01:02:47,269 --> 01:02:51,510
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up. Quiet. Shut up. Shut the fuck up. Shut up.

185
01:02:51,510 --> 01:03:18,780
Shut the fuck up. Where do I go? How do I hide from this guy? Oh my God. Under the bed. He's

186
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:58,619
not here. Screwdriver. Got it. Okay. Screwdriver. Undo the, uh, undo. Okay. This is the thing with

187
01:03:58,619 --> 01:04:31,000
the gas. Where's the room with the gas in it? Fuck you. I hate granny likes. So unscrew it. Um, excuse

188
01:04:31,000 --> 01:05:50,539
me. I have a screwdriver in my hand. Is there, can I save the game? Wood, water, water, as well as

189
01:05:50,539 --> 01:06:16,469
medical tools and treatments. Oh, oh, okay. That's very, very appreciated. I can only save the game

190
01:06:16,469 --> 01:06:35,639
like three times. Yeah, that was loud too, wasn't it? Dude, it's fucking loud. I'm bringing like this

191
01:06:35,639 --> 01:08:27,270
down just like to 90. You know what I mean? It's loud. What? Okay. So I just keep going. The camera?

192
01:08:32,949 --> 01:08:42,420
Blind. What? Blind? What do you mean blind? I missed something. What'd I miss? It's intense.

193
01:08:42,420 --> 01:09:11,380
I'm terrified. What'd I miss? I miss something. Miss something. Oh, it feels like I've been locked

194
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:15,689
in this house for weeks, but it's only been a few days. I'm losing track of time. I hear wailing

195
01:09:15,689 --> 01:09:21,979
coming from under the house. What is he doing down there? I can't thinking about that. There were

196
01:09:21,979 --> 01:09:27,220
tunnels down there. It looked like they went on forever. I tried to escape, but he caught me with

197
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:34,779
that damn radar. He locked me back upstairs, but I saw where he keeps the radar. Locked it in the

198
01:09:34,779 --> 01:10:03,210
closet. The combination was five, two, nine, one. Don't forget that number. Jesus. What did it say?

199
01:10:25,779 --> 01:10:46,260
Locked? Do I have a key for this? Yeah. Fucking granny. Can I sneak it? Right. Are they even alive?

200
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:09,739
What door? Where am I? No, not the fucking house.

201
01:11:13,819 --> 01:11:17,100
Quick, take everything I can. Take the hand. Take the hand. Take the hand. I can't.

202
01:11:22,619 --> 01:11:35,340
Oh, I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. Fuck. Two days remain. I'm not going to be able to be a granny

203
01:11:35,340 --> 01:12:12,100
like it. I don't. I will. I've never completed a granny like it's never happened. Where am I now?

204
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:58,619
Dude, what is going on right now? What the fuck? Do I have to stare at this? What's going on? Look

205
01:12:58,619 --> 01:13:25,399
at me. I keep doing this. Ow. I'm so glad I turned it down. Sacrifice. And that's at like 50%. Where

206
01:13:25,399 --> 01:13:48,600
am I now? I'm turning it down even more. Turn it down. Turn it down. Turn it down. Turn it down.

207
01:13:53,819 --> 01:14:22,649
I'm dead. Take the door hinges off. These games are so fucked up. I'm not turning it up. Is it?

208
01:14:22,649 --> 01:14:57,180
Is that actually it? Or is there more? I think I lost the house. So there's a part four. You lost.

209
01:14:57,180 --> 01:15:03,529
Yeah. I got the bad ending. All right. Should I try this one more time? I feel like I'm never

210
01:15:03,529 --> 01:15:23,180
going to beat this. Okay. I'm going to try it again. Turn it back up a little bit. I try one

211
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:45,579
more time. I usually don't play granny likes. I really don't. Granny likes are cool, but there's

212
01:15:45,579 --> 01:15:50,140
so much intense shit going on that my brain only can focus on the scary parts and I can't figure

213
01:15:50,140 --> 01:16:09,579
out where the bubble gum goes. Yeah. This part. There was another place I could go down too,

214
01:16:09,579 --> 01:16:21,609
wasn't there? Just say survival horror. Well, not every survival horror is a granny like.

215
01:16:21,609 --> 01:16:51,140
I'm going to go back down to where that place where I was before. This way, right? There were

216
01:16:51,140 --> 01:17:04,819
two places to go down. I kind of feel like I want to. No, not this way. All right. I got to stop

217
01:17:04,819 --> 01:17:15,510
looking at chat. I got to pay attention to where the fuck I'm going. All right. This way. Okay.

218
01:17:15,510 --> 01:17:28,229
This time don't wake the grandma. What? What's happening? Why did I? I just, I just moved.

219
01:17:28,229 --> 01:17:59,079
My body just moved all over the place. What am I looking at here? Huh? What? Bandages. That's it,

220
01:17:59,079 --> 01:18:31,220
right? Locked. How do I get the fuck out of here? Am I stuck in here? Can't reach. Grab climbing.

221
01:18:35,060 --> 01:19:04,500
Oh my God, dude. Go for, go forward. Go. So that was what was on the other side. Okay. Don't

222
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:35,270
go near granny. It's all locked. It's in here. Toilet. Toilet lid. Paperclip. Can I use it? I

223
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:49,579
think I could use this on locked doors, right? It shows a crowd draining a man's blood. Is it

224
01:19:49,579 --> 01:20:28,409
like a little remote controlled car going around the halls? I think I can hide in here. All right.

225
01:20:28,409 --> 01:20:49,579
I got a hammer. Titanium lock. Okay. I have a couple of, uh, I can pick some locks, right?

226
01:20:49,579 --> 01:21:33,930
Let's try picking a lock. I can't pick this. Okay. We saw this already. You got to use the

227
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:46,149
paperclip. Okay. I remember doing. Yep. This is, did I do the? Yeah. I already got it. Okay. So now

228
01:21:46,149 --> 01:24:04,390
how do I use the paper clips? Okay. So I can't do anything else up here. What is that? Hit him in

229
01:24:04,390 --> 01:24:23,479
the back of the head with a hammer. I don't know. I can't see him. No, no, no. Don't come in here.

230
01:24:23,479 --> 01:25:18,420
Where is he? I don't know. Is he left or right? Oh, please. I'm going to set it up right here.

231
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:36,500
Ding dong. Come and fucking get me right here. Come and get me. Come and get me. Hammer. You need

232
01:25:36,500 --> 01:26:20,789
to R1, R1, R1 granny. Am I going to touch this? Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. Oh my God. Oh,

233
01:26:20,789 --> 01:26:33,479
no. He turned the gas on. I don't think I can swing. This game is so fucking horrible. I just,

234
01:26:34,039 --> 01:26:46,739
I'm too like, I'm too like erratic to play these. And I had, I had, I tried to hit him with the

235
01:26:46,739 --> 01:27:01,909
hammer. I couldn't hit. You need to calm down. All right. I'm going to try to reload the game.

236
01:27:01,909 --> 01:27:06,739
I'm going to try it one more time and I'm going to calm down. I'm going to calm down. Here we go.

237
01:27:06,739 --> 01:27:15,829
I'm going to do it very calmly. I don't do, I can't play granny legs. I told you I installed

238
01:27:16,729 --> 01:27:24,920
granny too. And when I found out that I had to go up the stairs, pick up the hammer or pick up the

239
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:30,420
wood and go down the stairs, I was like, I held my finger on the button on the iPad and then

240
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:43,989
press the X button. I can't play granny legs. I can't do it. Rock. Hold on. Wait, can I throw,

241
01:27:43,989 --> 01:28:18,250
I'm going to try to throw a rock at granny's head. Will this work? Did I hit her? How did I drop the

242
01:28:18,250 --> 01:28:46,310
rock on the ground? Oh, I think I, I don't think I can do it. I'm too fucked up. End of the stream

243
01:28:46,310 --> 01:29:09,029
voice. Um, no, no, not yet. I love, okay. I like, I like these games. I like watching people play

244
01:29:09,029 --> 01:29:16,010
these games and know what they're doing. See me. I, I just like walk up to granny and she screams at

245
01:29:16,010 --> 01:29:39,270
me. And then I sprint around in a circle and try to hide under the bed and die. True. Was there

246
01:29:39,270 --> 01:29:50,279
anything even in here? I don't think so. It was a bandage, but like that's going to help. Yeah,

247
01:29:50,279 --> 01:30:05,720
there's nothing, there's nothing here. I remember getting stuck here though. Okay. All right. Oh,

248
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:13,539
come on. Not even a hard game. What do you have here? What do you, what's this? What do I do? Can

249
01:30:13,539 --> 01:30:21,319
I touch something? Lock? Um, nothing on the ground in here. This is locked. I need to, I can't open

250
01:30:21,319 --> 01:31:03,800
it. She's coming back now. Um, I gotta turn this off somehow. Shit. Cardboard box. Nothing, nothing.

251
01:31:03,800 --> 01:32:00,039
Oh, another vent. Okay. Unscrew it please. Unscrew it. Hot steam. I could die. What the fuck was that?

252
01:32:00,039 --> 01:32:27,130
What? I just, what did I just do? I can't take it off. This is a way to escape. I see this. I'm too

253
01:32:27,130 --> 01:32:36,100
s- I'm, I don't get this part. Can I turn this off with anything? Probably. I gotta go upstairs and

254
01:32:36,100 --> 01:33:00,460
in the bathroom and pick up the gum and bring the gum down here and plug it. Um, I don't, I don't

255
01:33:00,460 --> 01:33:12,460
know. I don't have anything to open this with. What about this? Wait, this is where I just was,

256
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:25,399
right? Yeah. What did I just hear? Can I just go through this room? Stop. Who's coming? I don't,

257
01:33:25,399 --> 01:33:36,470
I can't go through there. All right. I do have to go upstairs. It was, there was a code that I had,

258
01:33:36,470 --> 01:34:02,840
right? In the closet. Five two something. I just don't know where that is. You stupid motherfucker.

259
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:18,979
I hate your guts. You suck. I'm done. I can't do it. I'm done. I'm done. I can't do it. I can't do

260
01:34:18,979 --> 01:34:25,050
the granny likes. I can't like run up and down the stairs. I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't do

261
01:34:25,050 --> 01:34:30,649
it. It's, I, I, I have to, I can't do it. I can't do it. All right. So we're going to, all right.
