00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:19,719
Hi, welcome back to another day, another stream. Today, as you know, we're gonna be playing Tiny

2
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:29,289
Toons Wacky Sports, one of my favorite Super Nintendo games. I probably have as many hours

3
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:36,469
in Tiny Toons Wacky Sports for the course of my life as I do in Team Fortress. We're talking

4
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:49,909
thousands of hours from the ages of like 13 to 17. This is like one of the only games I own

5
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:58,600
for the Super Nintendo, owned when I was younger. Oh no, he referenced it again.

6
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:12,969
Tiny. Oh, funny. What about the Mickey game? Yeah, the Mickey game's good too. I'm sorry,

7
00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:21,700
excuse me. The magical quest starring Mickey Mouse. He's just in that game. It's the magical quest

8
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:30,629
starring Mickey Mouse. He better be so fucking good at this game. Oh, I'm gonna be real good

9
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:38,120
at this game because it's about hitting a button as fast as you can. And we all know I've come

10
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:48,409
close to that record. And when I beat that guy live on stream, that guy was like number 10 in

11
00:01:48,409 --> 00:02:01,189
the world. I became number nine. Is this where it all began? No, maybe not. Here's some personal

12
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:08,180
lore for you guys. Friends of mine used to hand me the controller when you needed to press a button

13
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:14,969
really fast. In Metal Gear Solid 1, there's a point in the game where you have to press the

14
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:22,710
button as fast as possible. And it is insanely difficult. And in fact, I mean, spoilers,

15
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:29,530
you have to press a button real fast. That could mean anything. But I used to get handed the

16
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:35,189
controller. Dude, I need you to do this. And I'd be like, hold on, don't worry, I got this. And I

17
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:43,900
crack my knuckles and just go. And then I would give it back. Because I'm a one trick pony.

18
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:50,840
I don't have any I don't have any other tricks. I have one if I was like a MOBA character,

19
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:58,379
I'd have one move. It would be unload entire clip in three seconds. And it would just do like 6000

20
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:01,659
damage. And then it would be like a two hour cooldown. You'd only be able to use it once a

21
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:14,889
game. That's just tracer. I wouldn't even have an auto attack. Oh, you just have to I just have to

22
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:20,409
walk around. And that one team fight that is really, really important. Just get me in there

23
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:24,300
and give me the controller and I'll just spam that button. But then I need like a fucking two

24
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:32,229
hour break, dude. I'm going to bed. I can't walk. That's a second move. What movement is not a move.

25
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:43,020
Anyways, let's play. This is a game about it's a mini game game. And say this is going to be a

26
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:49,349
long stream. I'm going to adhere to what we're supposed to be doing. Not eight hour streams

27
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:59,849
like last night. Play this for a little while. See what happens. This game fucking sucks. You

28
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:09,460
can't just use that when you want to. You can't just say this game sucks. All right, here we go.

29
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:15,460
I'm looking forward to this. Hopefully I have my button spam capabilities ready because you have

30
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:22,949
there are so many cases where you have to spam the button. I'm probably going to get exhausted

31
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:31,129
in the first 40 minutes. I'm not going to lie to you. Here we go. Is everybody ready? Oh,

32
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:52,569
I hear the music. Oh my God. We're tiny. We're toony. We're all a little loony. And in this

33
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:58,089
cartoony, we're invading your TV. We've got all the questions, the questions and expectations

34
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:04,329
and tiny tune adventures. It's invading your TV. So here at me acres, we're enjoying your TV.

35
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:11,129
We've been learning farts since 1933. Expect the unexpected. Expect the unexpected. It's tiny

36
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:26,949
tune adventures. Please enjoy the fun. And now let's keep going. You guys ready? God damn it.

37
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:38,420
We're tiny. We're toony. I'm not going to fucking do that. Ladies and gentlemen, Montana Max's

38
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:43,220
sports festival opens grand prize of $1 million. I told you, remember I said Montana Max.

39
00:05:49,769 --> 00:06:01,420
I'm gonna prove that I'm the best athlete in Acme Acres. I'm going to build my own

40
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:13,100
theater with this prize money with $1 million. I can become a presidential candidate.

41
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:28,310
What? I can party every day with lots of food. All right. I gotta be Flucky. Flucky's my guy.

42
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:44,139
That's just a million dollars. No, that's not Taz. That's Dizzy Devil. These are all their kids.

43
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,500
Buster. These are all their children. Flucky Duck. This is Daffy Duck's son. Dizzy Devil. This is

44
00:06:53,500 --> 00:07:04,149
Tasmanian Devil's son. Babs Bunny. No, they're not. They were supposed to be the new generation

45
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:09,029
of... Here's what happened. Let me explain. Looney Tunes came out and then they said, fuck,

46
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:15,189
we need a new generation of cartoon Looney Tunes. It's been like 75 years. Let's have like young...

47
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:19,430
Oh, here's like the new generation. Flucky Duck instead of Daffy Duck. Dizzy Devil.

48
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:24,230
And then they did it again, which you don't know in the last probably five years with the Teen

49
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:28,870
Titans. Teen Titans are now the Looney Tunes of the current generation.

50
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:49,670
That's Robin is Flucky Duck's son. That is Mike. The games are about to begin. Let's go. I'm ready

51
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:56,970
to spam. I'm ready to fucking spam. The first event is Ice Cream Throw at Wacky Land. Wait,

52
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:07,129
this is not a spam one. Instant loss. Throw the ice cream at the targets as they come out. If you hit

53
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:18,360
them in a row without missing, you'll get the big points. Okay. Throw, throw ice cream, move.

54
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:25,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm ready. I got to get 250 points to qualify. I'm ready. And then it goes...

55
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,679
The best song. Where's the OST for this shit? Not this one. I mean,

56
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:43,639
how many of the X's? I just have to beat these fucking losers. That's all that matters. See,

57
00:08:43,639 --> 00:09:02,600
what an idiot. Hit all the irons. 20 points. No! Sorry. That's why I screamed.

58
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:07,500
Oh my god. Okay, this is fucking hard. I forgot how hard this was.

59
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:23,059
I need 250, right? All right. I smoked them all. I'm good. There we go. I just had to get... Look

60
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:31,639
at this. Are you kidding me? This is like what happens when like... I'm like a 16-year-old

61
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:39,080
playing in the Little League. Like my parents lied about my age. Oh, he has 60 home runs this year?

62
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:48,120
Yeah, he's 12. Oh, are you sure he's not like 15? No, that's my son. He's good.

63
00:09:53,720 --> 00:10:05,980
Wow. Zero points. Bad. Come on. Usually I'm the one over there in that next ranking.

64
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:11,340
You know what I mean? Usually I have to look at the guy next to me that has a thousand points.

65
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:23,419
Not this time. I think this is... If I remember, this is like a Mario Party where they give out

66
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:28,840
points at the end for like how many times you got hit in the head or something. Chicken Race

67
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:40,299
at Acne Canyon. Good luck. Use the power gauge to set the strength of the rubber band and run

68
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:44,700
towards the cliff. Try to stop as close to the edge of the cliff as you possibly can.

69
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:54,940
You can only use your brakes once. Be careful. You fall to fouls. Imagine a game where they

70
00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:29,850
launched you at a cliff and you had to stop. Here we go. All right. Stop. Okay. Be cautious

71
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:48,100
this time. Second try. Okay. It's 250 to qualify. I have to get 250. I'm not going to go that fast.

72
00:11:48,100 --> 00:12:13,990
That was the problem. I went into red. How did I take that? 290. I'm good. Chicken Dash. 290.

73
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:24,649
Speed bonus. Boopy prize. Okay. Wait. Buster's getting up kind of close. I don't like where he

74
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:32,019
is. Third event is weightlifting at the TV station. Good luck. All right. I got to listen up to this

75
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:39,370
one. It's all about saving that power gauge. You lift the barrel before the others. You make three

76
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:45,419
lifts. You get the top points. If you're too slow, you're out of the competition. Save up a lot of

77
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:58,549
strength or you'll drop the barbell. Yeah. You just have to power. Just lift. It's not about

78
00:12:58,549 --> 00:13:28,200
getting the little ones. It's about getting one huge one. Fuck. Out of here. I went. Oh, hand me

79
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:40,200
the controller, Jeremy. Look at how fucking huge. That's how huge I am. He's just the Hulk. 110.

80
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:59,269
Oh, wow. Buster failed. Buster couldn't even do it. 750 subs. Wait. What? We have to do it twice?

81
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:02,629
Okay. Well, it doesn't even matter. I destroyed it. Let me see if I can get it in one go.

82
00:14:03,669 --> 00:14:42,139
Shit. It doesn't matter. You got to get it right on that needle. Buster didn't even try. Can we do

83
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:48,149
it again? Should I just not even pick it up? I've already qualified for the playoffs. Oh,

84
00:14:48,149 --> 00:15:08,570
it's just me and her. Wait a minute. I went. One try. First fucking try. I just threw that

85
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:18,889
thing into the ceiling. That's guaranteed that I win. Oh, no. Just challenge. What do you mean

86
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:26,090
challenge? My arms are already tired. How did I do this when I was a kid for like fucking six

87
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:51,059
straight hours? How did I do this when I was a kid? How? My arms. I already need to be relieved

88
00:15:51,059 --> 00:16:09,659
already. Stretch it out. Okay. I've won. I did so well in the first few competitions that

89
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,710
saucer throw. Okay. Then I can just literally throw this one in the ground and I just still win.

90
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:23,080
Power gauge and go around the circle. Decide the angle and let it go.

91
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:33,460
Don't throw it out of bounds. Go to the bathroom. I'm good. All right. They have all 321.

92
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:42,409
Here we go. How much time do I have?

93
00:16:53,860 --> 00:17:02,970
There we go. That's not coming back. That thing's going to get picked up by gravity.

94
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:23,420
Okay. I don't want it. Second try. Oh my God. Why did I think I still had a 14-year-old body?

95
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:28,599
I was like growing up. I was growing. My bones were strong. I was drinking milk every day.

96
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:54,839
I was like 15. I was strong. 16. I could pick up a fucking car. Midlife crisis.

97
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:11,819
No, there's no such thing as a midlife crisis for me. All right. This is...

98
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:19,269
I win. Fifth event is obstacle course at Acme Acres. Good luck, everyone.

99
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:26,220
Thing is though, I have to destroy this because it keeps getting up. It keeps ramping up in

100
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:34,099
difficulty and the events change to be way harder. Run collect as many items as you can.

101
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:41,799
Pump your opponents. Avoid Elmyra and hit by jumping. Oh, how do you jump? Wait, how do I

102
00:18:41,799 --> 00:19:07,160
control it? How do you control? Just run? I don't understand. I don't know how you run.

103
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:30,920
Why do I keep falling back? Is it A? Why do I keep just falling backwards? What do I have to press?

104
00:19:31,880 --> 00:20:05,299
It's X. It's fucking X. Okay. No. Come back at the sentry right here. Give me this shit.

105
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:14,359
I just have to beat the fat guy. That's all I care about. I have to beat this fat guy.

106
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:31,400
Did I win? Oh, I can't brawl. Whatever. It's okay. It don't matter. I can cure it.

107
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:45,660
If I didn't get a jump bonus, trip bonus. Oh, I fell down the most time. Okay, boss. So you

108
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:56,700
can't even sniff my score. That's how far away I am. Last competition. Birdman contest

109
00:20:57,579 --> 00:21:08,140
in the tropics. Good luck. Fly as fast as you can. If you get a certain number of targets,

110
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:18,329
you can climb a wire and then aim for Montana Max's mansion. Speed, brake. Okay. It's just speed

111
00:21:18,329 --> 00:21:35,670
and brake. That's it. There's only two things. Do I have to spam first? No. Okay. Just apply.

112
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:59,240
Okay. How does any other character fly in this game? Take the brakes. Oh, it's time. I have a

113
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:22,809
time limit. Wait, can I do it? I'm trying to land it up. Cut it. Cut it. Cut the wheel.

114
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:41,319
Why didn't I take the parachute off? Why wouldn't I take the... Wait, was I just going to...

115
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:55,210
I would just die. What was I expecting to happen there? Smash into his ceiling and instantly die?

116
00:22:56,170 --> 00:23:12,539
I got to figure... I mean, I don't... What would have happened? It's not like you lost because you

117
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:26,579
lived. All right. Number one. Maybe. Because he doesn't even get a place on the board. Password.

118
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:37,369
Okay. Somebody remember that. Write that down. It's Wile E. Coyote Jr., Road Runner Jr., and

119
00:23:37,369 --> 00:23:48,680
Montana Max. All right. Somebody remember that. Next, try the normal course. Do your best.

120
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:59,849
We keep upgrading. The first event is Ski Race. Let's do our best. Ski down the hill and grab as

121
00:23:59,849 --> 00:24:03,849
many point flags as you can. You can jump and land on the others to slow them down.

122
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:10,309
If you turn into a snowball, you'll be out of control. It's just move and jump. That's it.

123
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:36,230
No, it's just move around and collect the flags. Get out of here. Don't fall off the edge.

124
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:46,730
That's 30 points, but what? All right. Now just be conservative with this.

125
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:57,059
Destroying them. Dude, I'm fucking liking this song. Put your hand down. I can't.

126
00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:19,160
I put your fucking... I can't fucking put my hand down. This is a generic face sign. Yeah.

127
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:27,349
I mean, it's... It is because you can always tell when there's a really generic face line

128
00:25:27,349 --> 00:25:34,859
when the bass guitar is just counting to seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. One,

129
00:25:34,859 --> 00:25:40,220
two, three, four, five, six, seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. One, two, three,

130
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:54,460
four, five, six, seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Well, this is... I'm doing...

131
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:58,299
I need the points because you know I'm going to fuck something up eventually. Eventually,

132
00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:06,299
it can't be this good the whole time. I remember the log cutting one. There's a wood cutting

133
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:18,650
composition eventually in it. It always fucked me up and I always get so angry. Give me like a

134
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:28,900
thousand points. What the fuck? I want 500 points. 500 points or I'm going to uninstall the game.

135
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:44,660
It's not like on Steam. I'm going to get a Steam refund. Come on, speed it up a little bit. Let's

136
00:26:44,660 --> 00:27:05,509
get that bass line. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. You can count to eight. Am I?

137
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:23,319
What does the booby bonus mean? Booby prize. No one gets it. What is it? Chicken race. Oh, no.

138
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:38,980
Okay, so it's 300 to qualify. This is the run killer. This is the run killer. I need 300.

139
00:27:38,980 --> 00:28:13,109
Yeah, we got it. Max is 400. Hey, super frog. Thank you Burnout for that. I don't know why I

140
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:18,380
even said that. I'm so used to just doing that. Thanks for the five community subs, Burnout.

141
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:37,720
I don't know why I did that. Thank you Burnout for the five subs. 350, good. That's not super

142
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:56,869
good. Zero and zero for Dizzy. I feel bad for Dizzy. All right, still in the lead by a lot.

143
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:05,750
I can really easily lose this if I fuck up a whole entire event. Ice cream throw. Uh-oh.

144
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:26,019
Okay, just be good. 350 to qualify for this ice cream throw. It's not all there. He's fine.

145
00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:58,759
Did they give me a head start? That's a risky move over there. Fuck, I was going for that one.

146
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:23,269
Nice. They all fucked up. I got it. I qualified. The fuck? Hey. Hey, don't have a fuck with the

147
00:30:23,269 --> 00:30:29,430
guy whose main weapon in Team Fortress was the Huntsman. Bleeding targets. Blue plate special.

148
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:42,039
Oh, and there he is. Super frog. Thank you Super Bruce for the five community subs.

149
00:30:45,779 --> 00:31:01,259
Super Bruce five subs. Use the Luxman. What? You guys want to give me shit for being the guy that

150
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:09,900
every time that cough nucleus showed up. I just played Huntsman the whole time and just aimed at

151
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:14,779
that area where you could shoot down that long winding hallway into where the people spawned out

152
00:31:14,779 --> 00:31:21,029
the door. Just get a headshot every eight seconds. But am I the bad, am I a bad guy for that?

153
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:34,009
Apparently. Bull vault. Gather your speed by hitting the buttons and plant the pole and decide the

154
00:31:34,089 --> 00:31:39,960
angle and you're off. Try to catch as many stars as you can. If you miss a jump, it's a foul. Hold on.

155
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:46,940
I wear one, power two. Do I have to alternate? Shit. I don't know what to do.

156
00:31:49,430 --> 00:32:18,619
To alternate or do I just spam? Whoa! I missed. Oh shit. I didn't go for the pole.

157
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:35,779
Does it matter? I can't move over this way. I landed. Oh shit, don't even matter. I went under

158
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:48,059
the pole. I got to land on the squishy thing. All right, it's fine. I can lose this. I don't care.

159
00:32:48,059 --> 00:33:14,099
Wait, what's the qualify? 300? Holy shit. Wait, get these pink ones. Get a pink one. Yes. 410.

160
00:33:14,099 --> 00:33:27,180
All right, just land on the thing. Where's the thing? Where's the thing? I don't know what the

161
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:56,180
thing is. I win. I like this song. Landing bonus. Boobie prize. Hey, Duke. Thanks for the five

162
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:07,720
community subs. You're good. Thank you. Five subs. Rolling in. Fifth event is weightlifting.

163
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:13,139
Do our best. All right. I'm usually really good at this shit. I want to blow this thing.

164
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:28,010
Do weightlifting. Got to get three lifts. Not on easy mode. It's on normal mode.

165
00:34:28,010 --> 00:35:04,840
Oh, lost her pretty good. I want to see Dizzy's evolution. We never get to see it. We just get

166
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:42,519
to see the germ of Pluto face. I did this three times. Wait. Oh, he's out forever. I feel bad.

167
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:49,670
All right. I have to win. How did I get gifted if I'm not watching? How does that work?

168
00:35:51,269 --> 00:36:06,440
What are you trying to prove by playing this game? Do I have to be in a constant state of proving

169
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:13,769
myself? What? Why? Don't you know every single second of every day is a constant?

170
00:36:13,769 --> 00:36:31,880
You need to prove something to someone else. I can't let him fucking beat me. Oh, that was bad.

171
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:51,210
Oh. Okay. He's trying to prove. What would I want to prove with this? Hey, guys, you know,

172
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:54,889
I just want to tell you this. Super Nintendo, I can hit the button real fast. I mean,

173
00:36:54,889 --> 00:36:59,449
I've already proved that. You already know that. What else do I have to prove? You're seeing it.

174
00:37:00,329 --> 00:37:26,280
Literally ban that person. I said that. Look at that. Am I trying to prove that?

175
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:57,300
What are you trying to prove? That's so funny. Here we go. Saucer throw. I really got to you, huh?

176
00:37:58,179 --> 00:38:08,630
What do you want? What? We will just be like, oh, I'm trying to do that. I want everyone to like me.

177
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:15,369
Can everybody like me now? Look at how fast I can press the button. Do you like me?

178
00:38:24,329 --> 00:38:47,449
Oh, fuck. Tasmanian Devil Spinner. Go home. No. No. You don't as a 35 year old man,

179
00:38:47,449 --> 00:38:54,070
try to gain respect by playing Tiny Toon Adventures for the Super Nintendo. What are

180
00:38:54,070 --> 00:39:17,300
you talking about? Shit. Don't go out of bounds. Don't go out of bounds. Don't go out of bounds.

181
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:22,550
Right on the line. Oh, what are you talking about? It's not a foul ball that's in the poll. That's

182
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:41,480
inside. I lost. What was it? 250. Oh shit. What happened? Oh, you can't. I got to continue. I'm

183
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:54,019
fine. I'm good. All right. Saucer throw. Let's go. You get three chances. I'm losing respect.

184
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:22,710
I get that respect back, please. When I cross 400 points,

185
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:46,039
I'm about to. That's got to be a little bit right in the middle.

186
00:40:46,039 --> 00:41:22,980
Right there. Right there. Wine drive. Inbound. Yeah. More respect. Give it to me. Oh yeah.

187
00:41:26,389 --> 00:41:38,119
Hot box my room with respect. Feed off of it. I live off of it. I need it. Obstacle course.

188
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:48,760
This is the one I fucked up last time. Run. Collect the items. Don't get grabbed by Elmira.

189
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:58,440
Move. Yeah. Run. Jump. Okay. I'm like, what do I need to qualify? 300.

190
00:42:20,489 --> 00:42:46,059
I can't even fucking see where I am. Give me that coin. What the fuck keeps happening?

191
00:42:46,699 --> 00:43:27,940
How am I losing points? Dude, this competition is a fucking mess. Don't let Elmira touch you.

192
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:35,880
Die if she touches you. Whatever it is. Come on. Give me another piece of meat.

193
00:43:36,969 --> 00:43:53,610
Come on. One more. All right. Just don't. I did it. Just barely. Holy shit. None of them qualified.

194
00:43:53,610 --> 00:44:08,039
That's not even fair. Look at how badly tuned that qualification is. Half your participants

195
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:18,469
don't qualify. Come on. Here we go. Last is bungee jump at Montana Max's mansion.

196
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:28,119
Do our best. Okay. I need 550 points to qualify. Wrap a bungee rope around your body.

197
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:35,800
Aim for the targets in Geronimo. How many bonus panels can you touch? The time limit.

198
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:43,829
Elmira or Montana Max grab you. They'll slow you down. Be careful. Power and run. Power and jump.

199
00:44:44,630 --> 00:45:00,440
I remember this shit. Hey, you gotta... I'm gonna go right here.

203
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:45,980
Don't go too fast. Don't touch that. Double speed. Don't touch it. Oh, shit. Okay. I guess

255
00:59:06,489 --> 00:59:12,809
be honest with you uh the blue numbers that's like air water that's not a point number yellow

256
00:59:13,610 --> 00:59:19,289
red orange point number like that's an oxygen number you know what i mean like the the that's

257
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:33,590
a the blue is an that's an oxygen number for me just right thank you one person that apparently

258
00:59:33,590 --> 00:59:39,190
doesn't think i'm insane for saying that thank you one person for agreeing that the color blue

259
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:42,869
is synonymous with water just thank you for agreeing with that apparently we have

260
00:59:42,869 --> 00:59:59,099
a bunch of people to think water is orange all right saucer throw it's a power gauge okay 350

261
00:59:59,099 --> 01:00:03,239
it's got to be good this is going to be real good do a taz impression now no

262
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:12,329
what is the color that i say it is water wait what hold on i gotta pay attention

263
01:00:12,329 --> 01:00:29,110
so that's going to be damn good it's right on target straight ahead good angle too

264
01:00:32,059 --> 01:00:46,730
couldn't have been much better 350 i don't care if i have second place overall not one event

265
01:00:47,530 --> 01:01:00,039
so

266
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:10,710
look at that high angle too tons of power a little bit higher angle last time it's going to be over

267
