1
00:00:02,299 --> 00:00:07,589
I just want to read. No chat. Hold on. No chat.

2
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:14,070
Jerma doesn't hate streaming. He just delays every single stream and talks about retirement every week.

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:25,640
That's not fair. No. Hold on a second. The last, the last like five streams, I have reverse delayed.

4
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:30,519
I have started a day or two early. The last, besides this one.

5
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:37,000
Excuse me. There have been at least three or four straight reverse delays as of the last two weeks.

6
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:41,829
Hey, just because you didn't see it doesn't mean it didn't happen, right? Just because you weren't

7
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:48,329
here doesn't mean I didn't do it. So anyways, after today, I'll see you in like 12 days.

8
00:00:51,479 --> 00:01:02,979
Why do you have to be, why is it? No. You knew about that October break for a while. That's

9
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:17,829
not a delay. Well, I just pretended it's fine. It's my birthday. What are you doing? I'm crying

10
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:24,549
right now. Dude, he hates streaming. I love streaming. It's like one of my favorite things ever.

11
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:41,980
Anyways, welcome to the promised, promised breath of the wild Sunday stream. I told you I was going

12
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:47,109
to do it and here I am. Well, let's warm up with a little bit of platoon. What do you think?

13
00:01:48,859 --> 00:02:13,620
I'm kidding. Relax. I'm kidding. Today's the last day of Overwatch one. Um, oh, but all right. Um,

14
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:19,319
when was the last time I even played Overwatch one? It's been a long time.

15
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:30,069
He doesn't even care. I mean, I don't, I don't really play Overwatch. Should I play Overwatch

16
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:37,240
too? I mean, I'm sure I'll play it. I don't know if I'll stream it. Should I stream it? Take for a

17
00:02:37,240 --> 00:03:09,430
day? No, you won't. That's a lot of no's. That's a lot of no's. Adding PVE. I mean, is it as good as

18
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:35,699
the Splatoon PVE? That's my question. No, thanks. We're good. You know what? I really hope Diablo

19
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:42,569
four is good. You know what I mean? Like I, I hope like I've been there. I look, I'm a Diablo Andy.

20
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:51,110
I really like Diablo is like, okay. Cause I hated Diablo immortal. It was like, I fucking despised

21
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:56,900
it. I hated every second of it. It's, it might, it might be all right, right? It looks Diablo four

22
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:16,120
looks okay from the things I've seen about it. I hope so. I hope so for your sake. No,

23
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:26,069
it's all right. I will remember my fondness in Diablo two and Reaper Diablo three Reaper was,

24
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:32,310
was good. They made a lot of good changes. It's okay. Diablo three Reaper launch like the first

25
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:37,350
three or four months of that game. I thought were great, but then I didn't really like the subsequent

26
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:43,100
patches. I think they did a pretty good job trying to get it back to, uh, back to life.

27
00:04:50,149 --> 00:04:54,459
Didn't all right, correct me if I'm wrong. So I want to be corrected if I'm wrong,

28
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:57,019
cause I, if I'm incorrect, I want people to say that's not correct.

29
00:04:58,149 --> 00:05:10,470
The, did the game director for Reaper of souls end up leaving Blizzard because that's, is that

30
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:15,990
incorrect? That's not correct. That's correct. That's not correct. Great. Thanks for the help.

31
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:38,009
I love how somebody wrote probably. Let me, I'm just going to look it up because you guys

32
00:05:38,009 --> 00:06:01,540
aren't helpful. Let me see. Reaper of souls director. Hold on. Hold on. All right. Yeah,

33
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:14,389
he's gone. He left Blizzard, uh, in July of 2016. Well, I mean, isn't that one of the reasons why

34
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:26,230
that was the game was better? I don't know. It was my fault. What did I do? Well, okay. My point is

35
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:33,029
in my opinion, the, the, the guy that made Diablo through Diablo through the guy that made Diablo

36
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:36,790
three, a better game. And obviously there's tons of other people that worked on it, right?

37
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:43,350
But I would have liked to see that person come back to D four. I don't know. I don't know the

38
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:53,860
story. I have no idea, but I hope it's good. Look, I was overwatch one fun. I thought it was kind of

39
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,420
fun for the first like six months. I just didn't care as much as I did about like something like

40
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:03,930
TF2. It just didn't have the staying power that TF2 had. And obviously, very obviously, I mean,

41
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:10,120
you go back to my old YouTube channel that it was like a, wow, here we go. Lizards making like a,

42
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:18,019
a potential kind of FPS arcade TF2 like game. It was a big deal at the time, but it just,

43
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:25,449
it didn't keep me. It just didn't. I did have fun with it though. I, I'm not going to lie. The

44
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:34,490
first six months of that were really fun. It was pretty fog before all the balancing. I thought

45
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:48,790
it was fun. We'll see. Anyways, somebody said, stop stalling. Um, ban that person for life.

46
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:14,100
Hide that guy. Hide him. Wait, I'm sick. I don't want to. What? All right. Well, you get to stay.

47
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:30,259
Please eat sushi. Why? That's a weird request. Do I like sushi? Yeah. I think it's good.

48
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:41,850
Why do you want me to eat it? Why do you want me to eat sushi? Why do a sushi tier list?

49
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:46,740
Okay. I'll do it right now. I don't even need it on the screen. Uh, spicy tuna roll S tier

50
00:08:48,620 --> 00:09:00,059
salmon roll B, A, everything else F spicy tuna roll S tier, pretty much everything else F.

51
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:15,639
I'm not a huge sushi fan. Okay. I'm one of those people that will eat sushi and pretend like,

52
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:21,299
I think you made a good idea ordering that. What do you want to try it? Oh, it's, um,

53
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,460
it's like a yellow fin or whatever, or yellow tail or something, whatever it is.

54
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:30,980
She's like, Oh yeah. And then you eat it and you're like, Oh, all right. Hmm. Okay. Oh,

55
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:37,419
you never want somebody to do. Oh, wow. This is gross. No, I'm not going to say that

56
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:47,720
because it's not, it's just kind of not my thing. I love spicy tuna. I like, uh, what's maybe people

57
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:54,419
might think I'm insane for saying this. This is going to make people probably gag when I say this.

58
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:59,320
Uh, no, it's good though. It's, is it weird for me to say this?

59
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:06,259
I, okay. I like a Philadelphia roll. If you don't know what a Philadelphia roll is,

60
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:17,590
it's salmon, cream cheese, and avocado. I feel like people would think I was gross for saying that,

61
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:27,269
but a lot of you are saying based and wow, good, good, good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's basic. Hold on.

62
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:35,720
Isn't the very nature of like true sushi basic? It's raw fish on rice. Oh, that's the very

63
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:56,419
definition of a base of basic. Basic doesn't mean bad. It's just very, Hey, you got a little bit of

64
00:10:56,419 --> 00:11:05,779
raw fish laid on top of some rice. That's it. I'm actually, I'd rather eat that. I'm not into the,

65
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:12,659
um, like Omega volcano roll where the thing comes out and it's like stacked four feet tall.

66
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,659
Like, well, you know what I mean? I don't, it's like, Oh yeah, well, this is it. We'll see it's

67
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:24,820
eel. And then there's a, there's like a Szechuan sauce on top of that. And then on top of that is

68
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:30,580
tuna. And then on top, it's like a kebab. I don't, I don't like those. You can't eat them in one bite.

69
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:41,269
Those are sushi kebabs. Those are, I don't, I don't really like, I like eating it in one bite

70
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:47,669
as a Rick and Morty reference. I don't, okay. If that's from this season, I haven't seen it.

71
00:11:47,669 --> 00:11:54,250
So it's, it's just, we both thought the same thing was funny. Anyways, let's play.

72
00:11:54,809 --> 00:12:07,960
Could you please consider streaming another shitty, I don't want to say the company.

73
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,600
I could just say the name of the company, right? Like I'm not, Hey, can you please play the,

74
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,039
this game from this shitty company? Like I, I'm like, I don't want to say that out loud.

75
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:32,200
No, no, stop, stop it. Anyways, welcome to the stream. Hope you're having a good Sunday.

76
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:45,860
Yes, this is going to be, I will not be live. I will, I will not be live until I return from

77
00:12:45,860 --> 00:13:03,830
my October break. I will not be live. Okay. Okay. I will not be live. Okay. I'll be back.

78
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:17,210
Do a baseball stream rerun. Now I'm going to spend some time with friends, spend some time

79
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:28,779
with some family. I feel like it's pretty overdue, but it's time to play breath of the wild. I've

80
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:35,899
stalled for about, it's been two hours and 45 minutes on the orbit in soon screen. So that

81
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:39,500
person was right. I'm sorry about that. And kind of just chilling for like two hours and two hour,

82
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:57,669
42 minutes to 41. Yeah. I thought we were your family. You guys are my family guy,

83
00:13:57,669 --> 00:14:17,019
not my family. Make sure you get it right. Where, where your POG champs. What's that mean?

84
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:33,210
How long is the break going to be? Um, it's probably going to be maybe like eight days.

85
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:46,019
Okay. It will be eight to 10 days after the, um, okay. I'll be back in about eight to 10 days

86
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:55,580
after the last time you see me on, on camera. Okay. Cool. All right. You understand.

87
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:05,429
You're basically dead. I mean, no, like, I mean, like not the last time, whatever.

88
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:15,620
Everybody just be quiet. Breath of the wild. We're going to continue our play through.

89
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:24,230
Uh, I believe it's just this one right here. I just beat the divine, uh, beast, the elephant one.

90
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:30,230
You're wearing the shaggy shirt again. I am clean though. Don't worry. It's just so easy to wear.

91
00:15:30,549 --> 00:15:35,500
Like I don't, okay. Just solid colors are just so easy. I don't have to be like, what is this? Oh,

92
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:45,100
it's just green. Green. Easy. Like gray. Blue. Easy. Done. Can you eat a comedy sandwich? What

93
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:53,690
is the comedy sandwich? Oh, right. Okay. I just got, what did I just get? I got this thing.

94
00:15:53,690 --> 00:16:07,220
All right. Everyone said, don't use this. The comedy sandwiches is like, I don't know,

95
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:15,240
cream cheese, onions, Tabasco sauce, and like a turkey leg or something, right? It's like,

96
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:29,769
oh ha, it's like a funny sandwich you made. That sounds pretty good. A knuckle sandwich,

97
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:36,970
maybe. Are you going to punch me in the face? Hey, I got a funny sandwich for you. It's right here.

98
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:50,740
All right. So where do I want to go? I just, I beat this divine beast. I could go, hold on. Let me

99
00:16:51,299 --> 00:17:01,509
take a look. What we got? Destroy Ganon. Where's the other, this, this four, right? What area should

100
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:14,819
I go to? I mean, the easy, the easy thing is just to kind of go up and over, right? If I went over

101
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:19,660
here, then why not just kind of wrap around here? I have this marked for some reason,

102
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:25,480
so I'm going to go see why. We'll go to this pin. I think it's a shrine and cool.

103
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:50,500
Make a car tier list now. I don't know anything about cars. I mean, like what, like car types

104
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:58,740
or car like makers, like Chevy, Ford, Chrysler. What do you mean? Like, oh, truck hatchback. What

105
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:11,019
do you mean? All right. How do I get out of here? I think I have to go this way. Yeah. Okay. I'm

106
00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:22,599
going to go, I've got to go this way. What are these? All right. Wait, why do I have somebody

107
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:32,279
stamps on the map? Car companies. I don't know anything about car companies. I don't know

108
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:43,859
anything about them. Wait, I have to turn this in, don't I? Here's the picture. This is the one I got.

109
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:56,420
What do you think? Yeah, that's pretty damn good. My apologies. That sound was not very dignified,

110
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:02,900
was it? Pardon me. I'm all better now. That Lionel. How terrifying. Well, look at this and I

111
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:07,849
doubt anyone would get any reckless ideas about visiting Plymouth mountain. Well,

112
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:23,509
here's a follow-up to that. He's dead. Send as many people up there as you want. I killed him. Oh,

113
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:41,079
shit. Okay. This is part of the Zora set for now. Cool. East Reservoir Lake was created in a

114
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:45,480
collaboration between Hylians and the Zora. After East Reservoir Lake was finished, we made Zora

115
00:19:45,480 --> 00:20:00,339
Greaves as a token of our friendship. Thanks. Cool. You can swim fast. Cool. You think they'll ever

116
00:20:00,339 --> 00:20:03,779
make like, you know how it's like, oh, we have to have game difficulties. Do you think they'll

117
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:10,359
have a game in patient modes where we just kind of use like fallout to zero intelligence dialogue,

118
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:14,099
like get through the story and stuff, or just like take these. They're good. Make you swim fast.

119
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:24,980
Oh, cool. Thanks. Appreciate it. Like swim fast. You get equip if want. Oh, I get it. I understand

120
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:35,769
it. I know what you what you're asking and telling me. I hope not. Do put on caveman communication

121
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:43,900
mode. I don't know. Sometimes you're just looking for, did a bubble just come out of my mouth?

122
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:52,789
Sometimes you're just looking for you do this by it's kind of I know I'm going to make a wild

123
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:58,059
reference, but it kind of reminds me of you just run around the town and wow, pick up every single

124
00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:03,259
exclamation point, skip everything and just hit M and look where you need to walk to like to the

125
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:09,240
quest. That's it. You don't read anything. Guys, I don't even I didn't even know what half of the

126
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,880
quests were until I got to the point of the map where it was like a circle and said kill that

127
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:21,960
thing. I was like, oh, that's what I'm supposed to do here. All right. So I'm I don't think I

128
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:35,220
can climb this mountain. Well, it's not raining anymore. I get up here. I'm going to try it like

129
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:42,710
I can stand up there. Doesn't everyone do that with every MMO? I mean, probably it's the most

130
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:53,740
efficient way to level up. I shouldn't have done that. What an idiot. OK, I definitely can get up

131
00:21:53,740 --> 00:22:17,690
there. I'm just so I know I can get up there. Start here. God damn it. Hold on. OK, I'm going

132
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:28,650
to skip like 30 minutes of walking by doing this. You can go up the waterfall. Oh, wait. Oh, yeah.

133
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:34,359
It is right there. It's been like a week. I haven't played in a week. It's been a while. I

134
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:46,619
haven't played. Let me see if I can even do this. No, no, no, no, no, no. We're just going to go up

135
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:53,130
the waterfall. Watch your skip. No, if you skip, you made a mistake because look, now you skipped

136
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:56,170
like 10 minutes and you're like, where am I? What the fuck? I thought he was climbing a wall.

137
00:22:56,170 --> 00:23:20,519
Don't tell people to do that. OK, where's that waterfall right here? Vod Watchers skip four

138
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:26,740
minutes. If you if you're going to skip less than five minutes in this stream, come on. Are

139
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:34,630
what are you skipping? Really? Though those of you that are saying Vod Watchers skip two minutes

140
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:40,789
are caveman communication difficulty. Andy's like me. I don't want to hear it ever again.

141
00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:47,779
What I just said, I got question marked and now people are saying skip two minutes,

142
00:23:47,779 --> 00:23:53,940
skip five minutes, skip 10 minutes. Isn't that what I just was talking about? I wanted to.

143
00:23:53,940 --> 00:24:06,329
Where's my mode where I just get to get to the parts where I want to see? I'm not going to die,

144
00:24:06,329 --> 00:24:14,579
right? I have stamina food, don't I? Oh, fuck. Hold on. Hold on. Eat the stamina food.

145
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:49,339
Because I'm going to die if I don't skip to the next sorcery stream. There we are.

146
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,519
You know, I just thought of a funny thing. What if? All right. Now it's over.

147
00:25:03,829 --> 00:25:08,309
All the Vod Watchers skip all the Vod Watchers skip. What if I opened up sorcery

148
00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:14,630
and just played it for two minutes? So people that skipped got just absolutely just screwed over,

149
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:20,710
right? Like, wait, what? He's playing sorcery. What happened? Whatever. I'm out of here.

150
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:33,559
And then that's that's what happens when you skip. And in that two minute stretch of this stream,

151
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:40,970
I talk about how Breath of the Wild is like, not for me. Now, I'm not a fan. I'm not a big fan.

152
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:43,690
I'm just gonna play sorcery. You know what I mean? So that'll do, you know, that'll teach you to skip

153
00:25:43,690 --> 00:26:02,700
five minutes and then you just don't watch the rest. Mm hmm. Camera was weird. All right. One,

154
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:17,589
two, three, four, five. Moblin guts. Can we just play the game? LOL. Yeah. All right. No,

155
00:26:17,589 --> 00:26:22,410
I did say that I was today was guaranteed to not be a crack stream. I did say that.

156
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:32,170
You are right. That's very accurate. I did say that. Where are my pins? All right. Well,

157
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:50,390
I'm going to take this off. Wait, no, I'm not. Why is this pinned? Who did that? OK, so we got one

158
00:26:50,390 --> 00:27:15,480
here. There is where else you stole that? You stole his organs. OK, any others? Yeah, over there.

159
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:39,880
OK, and one over here. Nice shrines. My favorite part. What is that thing? Oh, shit. Look at that

160
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:48,779
one. All right. I got to delete the other pins. I don't know what this was, but maybe someone

161
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:59,220
will remember. So which one should I go to first? I'm going to say start on the left side, right?

162
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:21,509
I don't know. I'm going over there. Go to the tower first. That one. That's the tower right

163
00:28:21,509 --> 00:28:31,990
there, right? Is there another one? Oh, all right. Bro, I didn't see it. Look, I was looking like

164
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:40,009
this. My field of view was this. I'm going like this down. I see I don't. It's not there on my.

165
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:46,259
My eyes don't see it. It's no, it's not. It's not blind. Look, do you see a tower? I don't.

166
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:52,259
There's no tower on my screen. I'm going left. I'm looking for a shrine going right. I mean,

167
00:28:52,259 --> 00:29:01,430
like it was like this. Now that I go like that, I can see it. It wasn't in frame. No, it wasn't.

168
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:08,519
You went up. No, I didn't. But I wasn't looking. All right. I'm going to go get the tower.

169
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:26,440
Can I make it from here? What is that? I'm falling off the cliff because I thought I was

170
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:48,220
zooming in. It's up on the D pad. OK, Guardian Skywatcher. What the hell is that? All right.

171
00:29:48,220 --> 00:30:11,099
I'm going for it. Let's go. I just don't go in that light. I'm sick. I'm just going up there.

172
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,289
Oh, don't go over there. It's going to go.

173
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,690
But that's sort of way for that sort of way for that sort of way for that sort of way.

174
00:30:27,769 --> 00:30:34,680
I'm going to start my fucking lightning. All right. OK, put how do I put the weapons out?

175
00:30:34,680 --> 00:31:07,240
How do I unequip these? All right. Thought I got hit. Geez. Oh, you know what? Hold on.

176
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:31,990
Let me put my climbing gear back on. What the fuck? All right. Whatever.

177
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:49,210
Well, very obviously, I'm going in the wrong direction. I can still I think I can at least

178
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:59,240
get on the lip up there or something. Right. Come on, get up and stand. Come on and just stand up.

179
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,799
Come on, everybody. Just get up. Come on. Put your hands up. Everybody. Just stand up.

180
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:11,930
Come on. Put your hands up. Everybody. Just stand up. I forgot about that. That's like my

181
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:19,849
favorite song. Everybody put your hands up. Everybody. Just stand up. Everybody. Put your

182
00:32:19,849 --> 00:32:32,119
hands up. Everybody. Just stand up. That's like so fucking funny. It really is. I it's genuinely

183
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:59,180
funny. Everybody put your hands up. Well, I need to hear it now. Right. Like I have to listen to

184
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:17,019
it now. There's no world where I don't put that on. Was it called the American Bible Challenge?

185
00:33:17,019 --> 00:33:45,720
That's what it is. This is it. Right. OK. American Bible Challenge theme song. I want to be able

186
00:33:45,720 --> 00:34:17,369
to hear it because I have my headphones plugged in a different spot. It's that this is I love

187
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:40,809
this so much. You have you have no idea. One more time. Then I think that's him singing it.

188
00:34:41,369 --> 00:34:49,449
Right. Right. I think that's Jeff Fox really singing that. Is it? And then that makes it

189
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:59,239
so much better. No, not one more time. We're done. No shot. I am not kidding. I genuinely

190
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:05,820
like that. I love that song. It's so funny. It's it's perfect. I just love every second of it.

191
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:14,360
All right. I got to plug this back in. Hold on. Put your hands up. Everybody put your hands up

192
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:20,340
and stand up, too. And your hands up yet. Stand up and you better put your hands up.

193
00:35:20,340 --> 00:36:07,429
Everybody stand up. This is not a crack stream. I can get up and stand up,

194
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:26,309
but I actually can, though. I actually can. I can. Damn it. I felt I'm doing this the wrong.

195
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:50,409
Oh, can I get up here this way? This probably one path. I can't do it. I don't think I can do it.

196
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:54,570
All right. Please tell me if I'm. Can I actually can I actually get up there and can I actually

197
00:36:54,570 --> 00:37:03,179
stand up and put my hands up and climb up that? Can I do that? Or am I just wasting time here?

198
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:09,820
Yes. OK. Oh, just the weather is in the corner. Oh, all right. So it's going to be rainy for like

199
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:33,460
another few hours. Can I pass time? All right. It's almost gone. This guy's going to clear up

200
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:57,780
a little bit. All right. We got clear skies. Let's go. What? You piece of shit. Really? All right.

201
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:19,530
This guy's going to clear up actually in a minute. You have climbing clothes. They're on. What about

202
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:31,349
season's tier list? You got it. Well, where? What region? Where I am right now in Las Vegas

203
00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:37,719
or what region? Because it depends in Boston, New England. All right. My favorite New England

204
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:45,179
season is not summer. It's like hot. It's kind of gross, sweaty, humid mosquitoes, bugs, ticks.

205
00:38:45,179 --> 00:38:55,780
No, thank you. Spring. That's all right. It's cool. I'm a fall guy. I'm a fall guy from New England

206
00:38:55,780 --> 00:39:05,079
and has nothing to do with the trees all change colors. No, I like that fall air. The fall air

207
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:12,090
is even over here in Vegas. It hits different, doesn't it? There is a different smell. Did I

208
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:20,630
wait too long and miss the fact that there was no rain? Whatever. Fall air, that like 60 degree fall

209
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:29,530
air has a certain sense to it. It's like that fall, slightly chilled, but like room temperature

210
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:36,780
on a kind of earthy sense. Do you know what I'm talking about? Fall has a certain smell.

211
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:45,400
It's not a smell. It's like a sense. It's like a crispy. Yes. It's a crispy sense in your like

212
00:39:45,400 --> 00:40:01,780
face. Fall is the best. Winter is cool too. I like winter. Winter out in Vegas is actually really

213
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:10,039
cool because it's so cold, but there's no snow. It's just free. It's really cold, but no snow,

214
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:16,820
no precipitation. It's really interesting. So you can go. The air is so still and chilly,

215
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:22,969
but there's never any snow. This is an NPC conversation. Like you mean like a GTA NPC

216
00:40:22,969 --> 00:40:32,250
or what do you mean by that? What? I can't talk about the weather. Why would it be like an NPC

217
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:54,260
conversation like in a game? This is a Morrowind NPC talking. A Morrowind NPC does not know. A

218
00:40:54,260 --> 00:41:10,599
Morrowind NPC is like this. Hello afternoon. Hello. They don't do that. Watch it. They don't say

219
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:29,300
anything. The Morrowind NPC is not going to give a weather tier list. What are you talking about?

220
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:33,909
What the fuck? It's not raining. It's cloudy. It's supposed to be cloudy.

221
00:41:33,909 --> 00:42:05,530
Oh my goodness. I don't have a weapon. All right. See ya. No.

222
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:40,630
It stopped. I found the place to go. Oh my God. I annihilated that guy. Oh shit. What do I do?

223
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:44,409
What do I do? What do I do? What do I do about that? What do I do? So I hide? How do you hide?

224
00:43:31,219 --> 00:43:54,170
Man will always be smarter than machines. I'm going to try to stand right up here.

225
00:43:54,170 --> 00:44:04,409
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

226
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:36,840
I got it. I made it. You're doing a lot of Switch stuff, huh? Yeah, I am. I'll get away from the

227
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:43,690
Switch eventually here. But to be fair, let's be fair, there was a long period where I did not

228
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:50,940
turn this thing on for like eight months or something, right? So come on. It's only fair.

229
00:44:50,940 --> 00:45:04,440
Are you going to finish the game on stream? I don't know. I can tell you all that I know.

230
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:10,949
And what I know is I'm very much enjoying playing it on stream and hanging out until that stops

231
00:45:10,949 --> 00:45:14,550
being the case or until I want to be able to finish it off stream. I don't know. I'm still here.

232
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:24,039
What did that even do? I thought that was going to clear all the all the goo.

233
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:30,659
Oh my god. Get out of that. Get out of it. You better. All right. You're not going to tell me

234
00:45:30,659 --> 00:45:46,219
what I should and should not do. Okay. You understand me? There's probably a few of them

235
00:45:46,219 --> 00:46:08,170
that I have to get rid of, right? See any more eyes? Oh, I thought that was a chest. We got sword,

236
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:18,500
rusty sword, rusty shield. I'll take it. I can cook, but I don't. I don't. Ah, I'm not going to

237
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:27,260
take it actually. Never mind. I have tons of food. I don't need to cook. Oh, it's emote only mode.

238
00:46:27,260 --> 00:47:02,679
That means it's a puzzle. It's a puzzle of foot. Okay. Can you shoot these? I'm going to blow these

239
00:47:02,679 --> 00:47:24,389
up though. Wasn't that nothing? Nothing. All right. I'm just going to turn it on. I got four shrine.

240
00:47:24,389 --> 00:47:42,679
This is going to be a shrine stream. Okay. So why does he keep over fucking reacting? It's like

241
00:47:42,679 --> 00:48:01,219
annoying. Time the person out. Oh, you can't even write. Never mind. I can't gaslight you guys.

242
00:48:01,219 --> 00:48:29,139
It's emote only. Never. I didn't even look. This thing's been low. Never mind. It's going to break

243
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:49,210
broken. All right. Let's use the club. Ooh. Can I sneak in there? Wow. That thing's actually

244
00:48:49,210 --> 00:49:09,019
really powerful. 24. That's better than the Lionel sword. Okay. So let me go over here.

245
00:49:09,019 --> 00:49:41,820
I can sneak in here. I found it. Did you hear the sound? I'm exploring. Don't tell me to hurry up.

246
00:49:41,820 --> 00:50:02,980
I never would have found this chest if I did. Nice. Nice. 100 rupees. Now why is it on emote

247
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:12,949
only by the way? This seems pretty self-explanatory, doesn't it? I mean, now it does. I can't hit that

248
00:50:12,949 --> 00:50:21,670
like piece of sinew, whatever it is. There's definitely another eyeball somewhere hiding.

249
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:55,510
All right. Maybe not. There's definitely an eyeball attached to this sinew. See you later.

250
00:50:55,510 --> 00:51:17,369
Where is this? There's an eye somewhere. It has to be. It's definitely. It's going to be definitely

251
00:51:17,369 --> 00:52:11,210
attached to the sinew. Um, can I break that? Where's this eye? Well, I'll go over here. All right.

252
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:27,559
Now what? I need some more weapons. I'm out of like shitty weapons to use. Wait a minute. Can I

253
00:52:27,559 --> 00:52:54,150
burn it? I can burn it. I think I can burn it. Can I burn the sinew or can I? Where is this thing?

254
00:52:54,150 --> 00:53:12,699
The inside of my, my brain is itching. The inside of my ear all the way in is itching.

255
00:53:12,699 --> 00:53:36,889
There's an eyeball just sitting hidden somewhere and I got to find this stupid eye in here.

256
00:53:36,889 --> 00:54:14,260
Shit. No, no, no, no, no. Oh my God. I almost died. I'm all right. I really hope there's no

257
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:44,539
goo up here. I can't climb that. Why? Oh shit. Hold on. I tried to jump, but he jumped up and

258
00:54:44,539 --> 00:54:50,920
not back. How do you jump backwards? I wanted to, I wanted to jump backwards.

259
00:54:50,920 --> 00:55:13,400
I don't want to jump. How do you jump out? I didn't want to jump up. How do you jump out?

260
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:27,610
Where is this thing? Oh, there's a chest over there. It has to be something with the fire.

261
00:55:27,610 --> 00:55:32,619
It has to be with the fire. Don't not like this me. Bomb arrow. All right. It's got to be like a

262
00:55:32,619 --> 00:56:34,539
explode something. I don't know. I, there's no eye. I'm looking for another eye or fish.

263
00:56:34,539 --> 00:57:35,849
Should I release them? No, not yet. I don't understand what's happening. I don't get it.

264
00:57:35,849 --> 00:57:59,139
Can I do, can I do this right now? Do I have to come back here later? Grab. I'm going to try.

265
00:57:59,139 --> 00:58:02,659
Okay. Can I, can I even hurt this stuff or do I have to hit? I was under the impression you

266
00:58:02,659 --> 00:58:11,079
couldn't hurt this shit. Like you have to destroy the eyeball. That's the only way. But can I,

267
00:58:11,079 --> 00:58:46,039
can I bomb the sinew? I'll try it. I mean, I'm lost. I'm going to bomb that sinew right there.

268
00:58:46,039 --> 00:59:03,219
Wait. Soccer ball kick. Catch. Kapow. Referee. Touchdown. What's that? Shoot the cannons at it.

269
00:59:03,219 --> 00:59:10,820
Shoot the cannons at the, all right. Shoot the cannons. Shoot. Turn the cannons around

270
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:25,670
and fire the cannons at that. Shoot the bomb through the touchdown. Shoot ball. Ball goes

271
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:48,139
touchdown. Fly torch. Ball goes touchdown. Santa Claus. There's no Santa Claus here.

272
00:59:48,139 --> 01:00:07,110
Catch. Catch football. Throw football. Touchdown. I don't know. What? What are you talking about?

273
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:21,849
Cold. Chill. Throw. Touchdown. Where, is there a place where I can put a bomb?

274
01:00:21,849 --> 01:01:17,849
That's something over here, right? Oh my God. What the? What? Hold on. Oh shit. My cover. Oh no.

275
01:01:17,849 --> 01:02:12,309
Um, dude, you fucking idiot. Let him out. Let him out. Let him out. Let him out. I don't care. Let

276
01:02:12,309 --> 01:02:14,869
him out. Let him out. Let him out. Let him out. Let him out. Tell me. Just give me the,

277
01:02:14,869 --> 01:02:18,809
give me the solution right now. Just tell me, just tell me the answer. I'm going to get kicked

278
01:02:18,809 --> 01:02:21,289
out of class. I'm going to get detention. I'm going to stand up right now in the middle of the

279
01:02:21,289 --> 01:02:41,000
test. I want the, give me the answer. Climb to just climb. What? I thought it was a puzzle.

280
01:02:42,099 --> 01:02:51,000
Just climb. Just climb is the answer. No, it can't be. Just climb. It's not a puzzle or like,

281
01:02:51,000 --> 01:03:06,659
oh, I'm going to get like a puzzle shit. Just climb it. There's a magnetized platform. There

282
01:03:06,659 --> 01:03:37,190
it is. But what was the football thing with the hands up? Climbing is the puzzle. I pressed B.

283
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:54,780
Why did it not register? Hold on. Let me just heal. Okay. So just climb up, but there's a

284
01:03:54,780 --> 01:04:04,099
magnetized thing, dude. Okay. I'm getting sick and gosh, darn tired of that happening. It just

285
01:04:04,099 --> 01:04:09,989
doesn't register the jump. It's not, it's not the controller. It's the game's input engine. Okay.

286
01:04:09,989 --> 01:04:44,059
Okay. So what the heck? There's a magnetized platform. I tried climbing up that side. Use

287
01:04:44,059 --> 01:05:05,960
the stasis. Oh, oh my God. Link stop just gluing to every single surface. All right. Down by the

288
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:24,710
eye that you killed, there's a magnetized thing. What the fuck was that? I, what is happening?

289
01:05:24,710 --> 01:05:30,309
Why is that not? I'm pissing off. I'm getting pissed off actually. How come I can't activate

290
01:05:30,309 --> 01:06:35,480
it? This is where the eye was killed. You just passed it. Huh? It's outside. What? This is the,

291
01:06:35,480 --> 01:07:11,099
this was the solution. I'm not going to die to the sludge. This, this little metallic door buried in

292
01:07:11,099 --> 01:07:47,380
the goo is the solution of the puzzle. Get out of here. This guy takes a lot of hits. Yeah. So

293
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:54,730
what now? What did you mean by it's the uprights? That's a good shield. All right. So now I can put

294
01:07:54,730 --> 01:08:08,039
this over here, bro. You talking about do this and then it'll fall like that. Oh, come on, dude.

295
01:08:08,039 --> 01:08:20,680
What the fuck? What? I'm sitting here looking for eyeballs to kill because I thought it was going

296
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:34,180
to get rid of whatever. That's, how is that a touchdown? That's not a touchdown. Well, that was

297
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:49,100
fun. Let me throw this away because this thing is 40. So people are saying you can actually just

298
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:55,079
climb it up it. Can you though? I feel like every, I tried to climb that. It wouldn't let me do it.

299
01:08:56,229 --> 01:09:06,100
Do I, do you like damage just hurt? Just, just go. You can't though. You can. It's on the,

300
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:19,909
it's the pillar. Okay. What's wrong with my character? You can jump off the half arch.

301
01:09:19,909 --> 01:09:40,500
That took so long. I have, oh, I'm cold. Okay. Is there a, does this make me warmer? I don't think

302
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:52,520
so. That literally took an hour. No, it didn't. It took like 25 minutes. I had like a 30 minute

303
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:58,199
opening of the stream and then I was walking around for a little bit and it's been 20 minutes.

304
01:09:58,199 --> 01:10:26,020
Do not add an hour just because it makes it funnier. It was 20 minutes. Eat something.

305
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:58,020
You're going to die. I'll be all right. All right. Look. Hey, we made it. We made it. How is that

306
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:04,899
kicking a football? Somebody give me a full sentence. Hey, I want a complete sentence on how

307
01:11:04,899 --> 01:11:31,689
throwing a football through the uprights is what I had to do there. The hands he makes was gas

308
01:11:31,689 --> 01:11:42,420
lighting. Throw down the path bridge to go up. At the arch you have to touch down the plank.

309
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:55,449
The hands point up. You can climb up. It's the shape of the magnet. Oh my God. What?

310
01:11:56,090 --> 01:12:03,239
It is the shape of a magnet. And you were saying I needed to pick. Okay. Well, I would never have

311
01:12:03,239 --> 01:12:20,229
gotten that. That's so funny. All right. Cold resistance. This one here. All right. Look,

312
01:12:20,229 --> 01:12:23,350
I got it. All right. Now let me do what I want to do with the thing that I like doing the most.

313
01:12:23,350 --> 01:12:37,989
And that's go to the shrines. Should I go to this one first? Which one should I do first?

314
01:12:37,989 --> 01:13:20,979
I'm just going to go to this one first. Whatever. This one. All right. Yes. Let's play. Let's go.

315
01:13:20,979 --> 01:13:35,770
Yes. That's right. Okay. Bye for like another 30 minutes. I'm going to do this in 15 minutes.

316
01:13:35,770 --> 01:13:49,029
Goodbye. See you in 15 minutes when it's done. See you in 15 minutes tops when it's done. What

317
01:13:49,029 --> 01:14:06,659
time is it right now? It is 4 11 right now. PM Pacific at 4 21 at 4 20 at 4 26. You'll be let

318
01:14:06,659 --> 01:15:14,550
out. All right. Here we go. Got it. Times it for 12. It's been one minute. I'm almost done.

319
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:57,960
Do not bet against me. Just saying. Don't bet against me. And a surprise. A few people here,

320
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:19,510
I think. Hmm. Okay. Very cool. What's next? All right. Cool. All right. Just checking out some

321
01:16:19,510 --> 01:17:36,649
stuff. Very nice. All right. What's this? Okay. Let's go. I'm going to scream so bad to get the

322
01:17:36,649 --> 01:17:56,170
energy out. You know what I mean? Just like reset it. Oh, look at that. Let's bet against them.

323
01:17:56,170 --> 01:18:04,310
Let's bet against them. Times it. Oh, wait. How much time do I have? Oh, look at that. Who

324
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:13,050
bet against me? Which one? Which one of you bet against me? Who did? It's 4 15 right now. I'm

325
01:18:13,050 --> 01:18:36,699
11 minutes early. Just saying. I'm 11 minutes early. Literally the easiest shrine. Well, why

326
01:18:36,699 --> 01:18:49,529
did you bet against me then? That's your fault. How do I get the? I have two, by the way. I'm

327
01:18:49,529 --> 01:19:01,479
covering the screen, you know. I lost a million points. Ooh. I did say don't bet against me.

328
01:19:01,479 --> 01:19:10,600
I made it very clear. You didn't get the chest. Well, I completed the shrine. I'll go back in.

329
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:32,819
Well, could I pick something up? The rules for completion are getting the orb. Yeah,

330
01:19:32,819 --> 01:20:03,130
come on. Nice. All right. So how do I get this? That was interesting.

331
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:31,350
All right. So now I mean, I think I have to walk on this. Can I hit it with a bow?

332
01:20:31,350 --> 01:20:55,260
Oops, a daisy. Okay. What? Where is it? I do I jump on that? I don't get it. How do I stop it?

333
01:20:55,260 --> 01:21:38,500
Good luck. I'm imagining I have to stop that. I'm going to run out of arrows. Oh, come on. All

334
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:54,470
right. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. You got to get the lip. It is stuck on the lip.

335
01:21:54,470 --> 01:22:06,180
Yeah. I stuck on the lip Andy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Whatever. God. Just do it.

336
01:22:06,180 --> 01:22:17,380
Just do it and stop. There's going to be an apple in this chest. It's not going to be worth doing.

337
01:22:17,380 --> 01:22:36,500
Oh my God. Don't jump. Why am I jumping? Just crouch. I'm going to have no arrows. It's so

338
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:51,210
stupid. If there are. All right. If there are five arrows in this chest, I'm going to uninstall the

339
01:22:51,210 --> 01:23:44,550
game. Damn it. Hold on. Oh, thank God. Don't screw this up. All right. I'm glad it's not five

340
01:23:44,550 --> 01:24:04,729
arrows because I didn't want to uninstall the game. How do I get out of here? Pick up your arrows.

341
01:24:04,729 --> 01:24:16,899
Oh my God. I forgot you could do that. All right. I'm going to pee. Never back. Pee time. That's

342
01:24:16,899 --> 01:24:21,859
where I deserve peeing. By the way, it's 421. Even if I did that, it still wouldn't be 426.

343
01:24:21,859 --> 01:26:30,619
I still whoever bet against me still lose. One sec. Why did I die? Oh, it's cold. Right.

344
01:26:32,869 --> 01:26:45,460
I froze. Okay. That was cool. That was a fun one. Let's do another one. Where's the other one?

345
01:26:45,460 --> 01:26:49,020
There's a couple other here. There's that one. Is that I'm going to go to that one down there.

346
01:26:49,020 --> 01:27:00,250
Get a big hole. My favorite part about this game is that there's atmosphere.

347
01:27:00,250 --> 01:27:38,970
So when you go higher in the atmosphere, it gets colder. Yeah, I think. Holy. Oh,

348
01:27:38,970 --> 01:27:54,699
this one right there. All right. I'm going to go to this one and that one. Should we

349
01:27:54,699 --> 01:28:19,609
place bets again? This way, that way, this way, that way. What if a middle hair part?

350
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:26,710
I don't know. My hair naturally just parts that way. I think. Yeah. I mean, I can do this,

351
01:28:26,710 --> 01:28:41,289
but show Otto. I showed Otto like a week ago. He's fine. He's just chilling. He's chilling,

352
01:28:41,289 --> 01:28:46,899
chilling out in his bed, chewing on a bone. He's having fun. I don't want to disturb him.

353
01:28:46,899 --> 01:29:09,109
All right. Let's do 15 minutes. Let's go. It's 426 right now. That's 36 at 441. I will have this

354
01:29:09,109 --> 01:29:17,399
completed 441. Let's go. Done. Easy. This would be the easiest one all night. That was on purpose.

355
01:29:17,399 --> 01:29:21,319
If you didn't know, I did that on purpose to make a funny thing. So everyone would go, oh my God,

356
01:29:21,319 --> 01:29:27,590
he got hit by the rock rolling. Actually true. I actually did that on purpose. And if you,

357
01:29:27,590 --> 01:29:31,270
people are like, oh, he's like pretending that he did it on purpose and like pretending that

358
01:29:31,270 --> 01:29:34,949
it wasn't on purpose. Right? No, I did that on purpose. I want to make that really clear

359
01:29:34,949 --> 01:29:42,619
and transparent with everybody here. I'm not kidding. Okay. All right. So let's obviously,

360
01:29:42,619 --> 01:30:11,460
we have to freeze that. Okay. Good. All right. I shut this one off. I broke this one. Okay.

361
01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:16,020
That one's magical. Why is that one magical? Oh, they're all, they're all okay. Nevermind.

362
01:30:45,109 --> 01:31:07,800
Game's fucking easy. Shit. Yeah. I know. I know. I know. Skip. I just can't die. Just don't die.

363
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:18,460
I'll be fine. I can pick those ones up. Weird. Oh, what weird. I can pick those up.

364
01:31:19,340 --> 01:32:03,979
Strange. What is that for? Weird. Interesting. Kind of weird. Okay. Weird. That's good. I'll take it.

365
01:32:03,979 --> 01:32:38,680
Thank God. All right. There's only one of these, right? All right. I got a plan. Imagine voting

366
01:32:38,680 --> 01:32:47,289
against me. Imagine voting against me. Right. So many of you guys just probably just lost twice

367
01:32:47,289 --> 01:33:10,489
in a row. That's three spirit orbs. I got the chest too. It's 11 minutes early. I should drop

368
01:33:10,489 --> 01:33:26,840
it to 10 minutes. The game is quiet. I'll take care of that. That's one of the easiest in the

369
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:34,010
game. So vote accordingly then. All right. Where's the other one? I want to do all these

370
01:33:34,010 --> 01:33:40,649
shrines. I love them. A lot of people say that their favorite part of this game is when Link

371
01:33:40,649 --> 01:34:17,340
goes, but mine is the shrines. I would say. You're wrong. All right. Let's do, I'm going to,

372
01:34:17,340 --> 01:34:21,189
I'm just going to keep teleporting back here and just fly to them. So much easier than walking.

373
01:34:21,189 --> 01:34:44,979
Where was that other one? Oh, right here. This is a bad idea. Wasn't there another one down here?

374
01:34:48,279 --> 01:35:36,060
If I land over here, I think I should be fine. So watch out for this butt head. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah.

375
01:35:36,060 --> 01:35:47,590
I, my language is pretty, it's pretty bad. I'm sorry. Where are you? Is this water too cold

376
01:35:47,590 --> 01:36:15,460
or something? Am I going to get hurt in here? I made it. Wait, what's this? Ooh, radishes.

377
01:36:15,460 --> 01:36:19,819
I should have taken a picture of it. I'm an idiot. These things are one of the most high quality

378
01:36:19,819 --> 01:36:43,369
foods in the game. And what? In real life. Looking for one of those little seed guys, whatever.

379
01:36:52,119 --> 01:37:05,529
Walk off the cliff. Oh, all right. Where is it? It's right there. Drop it. Then take a picture.

380
01:37:07,189 --> 01:37:23,640
Oh, so it, it still works that way. Oh, it does still work. You're right. You're right. I like

381
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:47,050
this area. Uh-oh. Bandits. Uh-oh. Bandits. Let's go. All right. 10 minutes. When I press the button,

382
01:37:47,050 --> 01:37:50,489
I'm, I'm giving, I'm making it easier for you if you want to bet against me. 10 minutes.

383
01:37:51,050 --> 01:38:09,060
The time is at 435. Wait till I get in. This doesn't count yet. I have to get actually into

384
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:29,989
the shrine. You have to get the chest too? No, it's just for the shrine. If you're reading this,

385
01:38:29,989 --> 01:38:36,380
I hope you're having a good day. Hey, you too. Thank you. All right. I got 10 minutes to complete

386
01:38:36,380 --> 01:38:43,590
the shrine. Let's go. Minor test of strength. Oh, you guys are whoever batted against me.

387
01:38:44,789 --> 01:38:59,020
You've got, I don't know. You've got some time here. Uh, um, seriously? I think this is free

388
01:38:59,020 --> 01:39:03,100
money for anybody that's going to bet for me. This is free money. You're literally watching

389
01:39:03,100 --> 01:39:09,140
it right now. You can still bet it's free money. This is free money. I'm just telling you right

390
01:39:09,140 --> 01:39:24,789
now, you're going to get channel points for free. It's free money. It's, I mean, it's free money.

391
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:38,579
I forgot that. I forgot the move set, but it's free money. It's actually free money. Watch.

392
01:40:00,619 --> 01:40:09,100
It's free money. It's literally, it's free money. You just, I'm not understanding that.

393
01:40:09,100 --> 01:40:21,270
It wasn't even, the timer wasn't even over yet. Oh hell yeah. Ancient battleaxe. Dude,

394
01:40:21,270 --> 01:40:31,939
the timer wasn't even over and you still could have got it. You cheated. You eat it. What? This

395
01:40:31,939 --> 01:40:48,779
isn't Dark Souls PVP. Cheated. He eat it. Cheated. He eat it. Oh, please. Giant ancient core.

396
01:40:48,779 --> 01:41:14,600
Extremely rare find. Ooh. Ancient armor. Ooh. Don't sit. Please save those. Don't make anything.

397
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:22,199
Okay. I got four. I'm going to do stamina, but I'm not doing it until I have at least a double

398
01:41:22,199 --> 01:41:37,699
turn in. That's how it works. What was it? It was 90% voted that you were going to do it. It's so

399
01:41:37,699 --> 01:41:43,369
funny. I think the, the like 4% of you that voted that I was not going to do that. I think we're

400
01:41:43,369 --> 01:41:48,970
banking on, uh, like my house getting struck by lightning and the power going out, right? Like

401
01:41:48,970 --> 01:41:57,340
it's like, it could happen. It could, and you'd get a huge return, but it's not probable. It's

402
01:41:57,340 --> 01:42:03,579
like, man, it's possible that like his internet just goes out now, right? It's possible, but not

403
01:42:03,579 --> 01:42:08,710
completely, not probable. It's possible. All right. Where was that last one?

404
01:42:16,649 --> 01:42:35,369
You were too overconfident. That's why I doubt it. Oh, 75 million versus 3.5 million. Damn. Wait,

405
01:42:35,369 --> 01:42:40,170
does that mean that the people that bet 3.5 million, it goes to the people that bet their

406
01:42:40,170 --> 01:42:48,250
points? That's how that works, right? So would you guys get like 50 points each? That was what,

407
01:42:48,250 --> 01:42:50,970
that probably wasn't, I mean, that's a safe return, but it's not a big return.

408
01:42:54,140 --> 01:42:59,340
We've basically gotten nothing. The three and a half million got split to everyone. That's so

409
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:08,680
funny. I got 10 K. I got two K. I got a, I got 150 points. I got six K. I bet six K and I got

410
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:23,609
6.9 K back. Okay. Safe return. That was a safe investment you made. Where the hell am I? Wait,

411
01:43:23,609 --> 01:43:37,529
what? Oh, I went to the wrong place. The people that were betting no had a 22.5 time return.

412
01:43:37,529 --> 01:44:03,699
If they won a lot, bring back, you need channel point rewards. I know the thing is I need to find

413
01:44:03,699 --> 01:44:07,859
a way to make something for channel points. That's not going to just like destroy every stream.

414
01:44:07,859 --> 01:44:12,039
Those of you that remember when channel points first came out and it was like, oh, what do I do

415
01:44:12,039 --> 01:44:16,300
with these? I had a thing where you could redeem a certain amount of, was it a hundred thousand or

416
01:44:16,300 --> 01:44:22,100
75,000 to make me wink on camera. And it's like, oh, that's funny. It's like a hundred thousand

417
01:44:22,100 --> 01:44:27,420
points. That's a lot of points. And people were redeeming them every 15 to 25 seconds at one

418
01:44:27,420 --> 01:44:33,909
point. It's just like, I can't do that. I'm not going to wink every fucking 30 seconds. It's weird.

419
01:44:33,909 --> 01:44:36,949
And then eventually I just stopped doing it. And then I did one where I just

420
01:44:37,590 --> 01:44:44,409
caught up and did it like 5,000 times or something. Right. All right. So where was it? There was one

421
01:44:44,409 --> 01:45:02,579
more. What was it? I swear there was one more. Am I crazy? There was definitely one more. What was it?

422
01:45:02,579 --> 01:45:12,460
Check the pins. Well, the problem with the pins is I never removed them. There's a pin right there.

423
01:45:12,460 --> 01:45:30,840
What's that pin for? What did I pin? What did I pin? I think it was this one down here.

424
01:45:31,699 --> 01:45:44,979
Did I do them all? It's in a canyon down here. I just don't, I don't, down, down, down.

425
01:45:44,979 --> 01:45:59,609
Where? Look down. Where is it? Between these two. Where? Where is it? Down there. All right. Down

426
01:45:59,609 --> 01:46:28,229
here. It's like down here, right? Yeah. Yeah. Mini map. No, I, yeah, I know. I was just making sure

427
01:46:28,229 --> 01:46:35,430
I had it in the right place. Hey, sunglasses Andy. Look at the mini map. I know I'm going,

428
01:46:35,430 --> 01:46:41,180
look where I'm going. I'm going in the right direction. Why are my sunglasses Andy? What does

429
01:46:41,180 --> 01:47:08,949
that mean? Smarten up fuck face. I like that comment. That's funny. Smarten up. All right.

430
01:47:08,949 --> 01:47:20,539
10 minutes. It is 4 44. The second that I go in here, the timer begins. I would start to bet now

431
01:47:20,539 --> 01:47:27,909
because we don't want to give anybody. No, you know what? Forget that. It starts. I'm not going

432
01:47:27,909 --> 01:47:34,090
in here yet. We're waiting until people bet because I don't want people to get an advantage.

433
01:47:36,539 --> 01:47:41,420
It's the timer starts not 4 50, not 4 55. It starts when I go in here because I don't want

434
01:47:41,420 --> 01:47:46,899
people to get an advantage because they're going to see, Oh, it's a, it's a minor combat test. I'm

435
01:47:46,899 --> 01:47:56,229
going to bet this way, right? So it's not 4 55. It's like 4 56 or something, right? Yeah. So you

436
01:47:56,229 --> 01:48:07,479
don't get, no, you, you have to bet now without knowing what it is. Oh, wait, we were fun. One

437
01:48:07,479 --> 01:48:14,600
wink a year. I just burnt my eye when I did that. I hope you all know. There you go. Yeah. Well,

438
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:24,390
I beat this in 10 minutes. The thing is, a lot of you guys have played this game. Why am I acting

439
01:48:24,390 --> 01:48:29,539
like the game came out a week ago? This game's been off for like four and a half years. So a

440
01:48:29,539 --> 01:48:34,920
lot of you guys know what is in here. So those of you that don't know what's in here, I mean,

441
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:54,550
you can just Google it and find out and decide whatever. That's all right. Well, I beat this

442
01:48:54,550 --> 01:49:29,180
shrine in 10 minutes starting now. What's the ratio? Power of fire. Oh shit. It's not a minor

443
01:49:29,180 --> 01:49:53,529
combat shrine. Oh, okay. Power of fire. That's easy. I don't have any arrows. Oh,

444
01:49:58,489 --> 01:50:26,359
don't need arrows. I don't know why I thought that just said, let's go. Like, let's go. All right.

445
01:50:26,359 --> 01:50:55,979
Now I got to knock that down. I don't have any arrows. Shit. I'm good. Why is that here? Why is

446
01:50:55,979 --> 01:51:17,640
that? There's a little lip there. Why? All right. So now I got, okay. All right. Okay. Can't knock

447
01:51:17,640 --> 01:51:53,979
this down. I got the treasure chest. Knight's bow. All right. Get rid of this fucking thing. 83

448
01:51:53,979 --> 01:52:08,220
to 17. Yes. Goodness. All right. So I can't let you guys down. How am I going to break the ones

449
01:52:08,220 --> 01:52:34,819
higher though? Isn't that impossible? If I don't have arrows, how can I shoot it? All right. I'm

450
01:52:34,819 --> 01:52:46,310
going to time a bit here. I'm on a timer here. Hold on. You break this one. Excuse me. Wait,

451
01:52:46,310 --> 01:53:23,880
what? Oh, oh, we're good. I got five minutes. Oh, I win. I got the chest too. That's everything.

452
01:53:23,880 --> 01:53:46,489
So that's all the shrines. Good. Very cool. Very cool. Very cool. Easiest points of my life.

453
01:53:46,489 --> 01:54:04,069
Yeah. I had some time to spare. I had at least four or five minutes to spare. How come you're

454
01:54:04,069 --> 01:54:19,699
only good when we bet? When I stop pretending. All right. So now, interesting. I got the shrines.

455
01:54:19,699 --> 01:54:25,739
I could over here, I guess, right? I guess I'm just going to try to find a road and just go up

456
01:54:25,739 --> 01:54:42,550
this way. See what I find. No, you know what? Let's go back to the tower. Is that, let me

457
01:54:43,449 --> 01:55:08,489
get a good kind of bird's eye view of this whole place. Don't listen to the haters.

458
01:55:08,489 --> 01:55:16,170
OK, so this is where I want to go, is over here. I'm going to put a pin right here because I want

459
01:55:16,170 --> 01:55:24,359
to see how far away it is. I can't even see it anyways. All right. So it's past the volcano.

460
01:55:24,359 --> 01:55:29,420
So the volcano is the next major thing that I have to do. So why don't I go over here

461
01:55:30,310 --> 01:55:38,180
that way and then up? Wait, around the volcano? I'm going to go to that tower over there.

462
01:55:38,180 --> 01:55:45,560
Wait, what's that? There's something right here. And then I'm going to go here and I'm going to go

463
01:55:45,560 --> 01:56:06,140
this way and then bang a right over there, I guess. OK, is this a oh, this is a stable. Cool.

464
01:56:07,100 --> 01:56:17,659
I'm a traveler. You must be a man who sets his mind on something and then gets it done.

465
01:56:17,659 --> 01:56:24,779
I'm the best. OK, I was really into sword fighting, but I'm a bit of a rut with it.

466
01:56:24,779 --> 01:56:29,579
Doesn't help that the sword I'm using right now is way too blunt. That's why I thought

467
01:56:29,579 --> 01:56:33,579
if I can get that legendary sword, maybe a new path will open for me. What do you think?

468
01:56:35,800 --> 01:56:40,039
Finally figured out that it's near Death Mountain. However, it doesn't seem to be

469
01:56:40,039 --> 01:56:47,140
in this direction. Maybe it's on the opposite side, closer to the Woodland Stable. Maybe I'll just

470
01:56:47,140 --> 01:57:20,420
mosey over to the Woodland Stable. What are you doing over there? What?

471
01:57:20,420 --> 01:57:24,100
Oh, wait. No, Highland Stable. Where's the Woodlands? Oh, I haven't found it. OK.

472
01:57:26,310 --> 01:57:58,859
OK, let's get Frank II over here. I've got to buy some stuff. Thank you. Let's get some.

473
01:58:00,329 --> 01:58:07,619
I actually think I have some food to make, don't I? All right. Very hydrating liquid. Heat

474
01:58:07,619 --> 01:58:12,100
resistance. I mean, I'm going to the Fire Mountain right now. Let's let's do that.

475
01:58:20,340 --> 01:58:41,100
Heat resistance. Yep. Heat resistance. I mean, it means it's a volcano.

476
01:58:41,100 --> 01:59:08,539
See what I get from this. All right. Six and a half minutes of low level heat resistance. Good.

477
01:59:08,539 --> 01:59:23,210
Individual radish. Wait, movement speed. All right. I'm going to do movement speed and radish.

478
01:59:23,210 --> 01:59:47,369
It's going to be pretty sick, right? But then I work. That didn't work. Boost your movement

479
01:59:47,369 --> 01:59:53,909
speed when the seeds are cooked into a dish. What happened? Oh, god damn it. All right.

480
01:59:53,909 --> 02:00:05,130
Whatever. I forgot. I thought this was just yummy. Well, that was a waste, but whatever.

481
02:00:12,279 --> 02:00:37,340
OK. All right. What about any lixir? I don't think I have anything, right? I don't think

482
02:00:37,340 --> 02:00:55,210
I have anything. Wood in your food. Here we go. All right. Three and a half minutes of movement

483
02:00:55,210 --> 02:01:34,810
speed. Do it again. A dash of salt. Good. Now. Do I have any, like, hot heat clothings? I don't

484
02:01:34,810 --> 02:01:48,390
think so. I'm going to wear the heavy armor. I feel like it's better for now. All right. Hi.

485
02:01:48,390 --> 02:02:05,300
Hello, Frank, too. There is a general story around here. You have a store, right? No, I don't.

486
02:02:05,300 --> 02:02:33,079
Beetle. Beetle. Oh, is this Beetle? Thanks. A guardian in the eye. To find him, go way

487
02:02:33,079 --> 02:02:40,119
north past Zora's domain all the way to Kala Ancient Tech Lab. All right. Somebody remember

488
02:02:40,119 --> 02:02:56,300
that. Write that down. What do you got? OK. Yep. Arrows times ten. Give that to me. How many of

489
02:02:56,300 --> 02:03:07,079
these do you have? What a waste of money. I'm not buying that. Oh, speed boost. Fire elixir. Let's

490
02:03:07,079 --> 02:03:19,579
go. OK. Let's just. You know what? Just buy it. Buy the whole store. Take the whole thing. That's

491
02:03:19,579 --> 02:03:28,390
a lot of money. Whoa. Hold on a minute. That's a lot. That's too much money. Is that too much money

492
02:03:28,390 --> 02:03:40,680
or should I just buy it? Let's do it. Whatever. Speed boost. Yeah. I mean, I have a lot of materials

493
02:03:40,680 --> 02:03:52,119
to make elixirs. Let's do it. And because I'm a piece of shit, you know, how much is that? No,

494
02:03:52,119 --> 02:04:07,539
way too much. All right. Let's go make some heat elixirs. Wait, look what I got. I need some

495
02:04:07,539 --> 02:04:15,020
backseat Andes to help me. Should I just sell all these? OK. If I keep selling all of my ore,

496
02:04:15,020 --> 02:04:26,500
I'm not going to have any ore to do anything in the rest of the game. Keep the luminous ones.

497
02:04:26,500 --> 02:04:34,229
Keep three of each. You barely need them. Keep like three of each. They're easy to get. OK. Well,

498
02:04:34,229 --> 02:04:59,289
or do I use to upgrade armor? Oh, that's right. I'll sell two of each. OK. I'm not going to sell

499
02:04:59,289 --> 02:05:08,039
the luminous ones. What about these? Two hundred and sixty bucks. Really? Is this bad if I sell?

500
02:05:09,770 --> 02:05:13,770
It doesn't. I don't think I use them in anything. Sell the gems. These are just money, right?

501
02:05:13,770 --> 02:05:32,489
That's a lot. All right. Now I actually have some cash. Oh, no. All right. Now I'm going to make a

502
02:05:32,489 --> 02:05:49,979
bunch of elixirs. Goodbye. It's a pretty good Mario impression. OK. So if I do two lizards,

503
02:05:49,979 --> 02:06:00,090
if I go boom, boom, double heat lizard. And then what's what's a rare ingredient? Just do one,

504
02:06:00,090 --> 02:06:17,350
not two. Just one. What's the highest quality monster part that I have? Does that matter?

505
02:06:17,989 --> 02:06:31,449
The guts? Does it actually matter? Oh, do what about the lionel horn? This would be like a this

506
02:06:31,449 --> 02:06:42,149
would be like an hour of heat resistance. No, no, no. Don't do that. Keep the keep this for later.

507
02:06:42,149 --> 02:06:50,260
OK. What about like the horn? Like these? These look like they're high quality. Keep Lionel. OK.

508
02:06:50,260 --> 02:07:04,140
All right. All right. Let's go. Let's see what this does. High level fireproof effect,

509
02:07:04,140 --> 02:07:07,770
which prevents your body from catching fire. Be sure to pack this when venturing to explore

510
02:07:07,770 --> 02:07:11,850
the Death Mountain, which is where you're going. OK. Yes. All right. Ten minutes. Let's do another

511
02:07:11,850 --> 02:07:31,640
one. Oh, that wasn't a good one. Why was that one worse? All right. Well, whatever.

512
02:07:31,640 --> 02:07:53,739
Why was that one worse? All right. Lizard. Temporary hearts. Oh, no guts. OK. Oh,

513
02:07:53,739 --> 02:08:04,550
oh, it's just a full heel. That's pretty sick. Oops. That's OK. Fuck. I ruined everything.

514
02:08:04,550 --> 02:08:11,880
Can I reload the game? Where's my last save? Sixteen fifty three. When was that?

515
02:08:11,880 --> 02:08:44,500
It's good. It's OK. No, no, no, it's fine. All right. All right. Don't sell the Lionel hoof.

516
02:08:44,500 --> 02:09:20,220
Why does that sound like I'm saying that word wrong? Mid level haste. Nice. You can't really

517
02:09:20,220 --> 02:09:44,550
softlock yourself. You'll find pretty much more of everything. All right. Five arrows. I already did.

518
02:09:44,550 --> 02:09:54,550
All right. I'm ready to do Mount Doom. Where is it? I got tons of food. I'm ready. Look at all this.

519
02:09:54,550 --> 02:09:59,189
Look at it. I've got more food. I'm a goddamn catering service. I've got plenty of food. Let's

520
02:09:59,189 --> 02:10:40,390
go. All right, Frank. Let's go. So where do I want to go? I got to go this way. So I'm thinking maybe

521
02:10:40,390 --> 02:10:58,199
just wrap around. I don't know. Let's find out. I go down and then right. Let's see where I go.

522
02:10:58,199 --> 02:11:12,359
Oh, my God. I just fucking ran that over. I don't know you could do that.

523
02:11:12,359 --> 02:11:45,829
Oh, pretty. Stay right here. Oh, it's a bomb. Good. Why did it? It's a bomb. Why did it explode?

524
02:11:45,829 --> 02:12:26,300
OK, we're good. Flurry rush. Oh, my God. He killed me in one hit. Hey, that's not going to be on

525
02:12:26,300 --> 02:12:38,340
cooldown, right? Did I just get absolutely decimated there? What happened? I died twice.

526
02:12:38,340 --> 02:12:46,329
OK, we're good. Let's do this the right way this time, please.

527
02:12:47,050 --> 02:13:32,630
How do you miss that? It's so easy. I'm going to scream. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. He overhand

528
02:13:32,630 --> 02:13:59,109
swung me in the head. Whatever that is. Let me. Whatever that is. A huge sword just dropped. His

529
02:13:59,109 --> 02:14:18,279
big sword dropped. Oh, yeah. All right. Who's left? Nice. Very good. No more melee weapons.

530
02:14:18,279 --> 02:14:31,720
Excuse me. Oh, those guts are worth a lot, right? There was a huge sword that dropped over here.

531
02:14:31,720 --> 02:14:41,880
What is that? Knights Claymore. Oh, yep. OK, what should I get rid of? I feel like this thing's

532
02:14:41,880 --> 02:14:57,659
cool, but should I just get rid of it? It's cool. It's good. Just take a picture of it. Oh, hold on.

533
02:14:57,659 --> 02:15:26,680
You're right. Good idea. OK, ice rod. All right. Oh, damn, this thing's cool looking. Oh, all right.

534
02:15:26,680 --> 02:15:38,310
I think I'm good. I don't have any more room. Keep the rod. Stop it. What should I get rid of?

535
02:15:40,300 --> 02:15:47,979
Get rid of the twelve spear away. But look at it. It's shining. This thing's got to go.

536
02:15:47,979 --> 02:16:13,659
Didn't I? This was in a chest. One of the guardian swords. I like it. I like that. What are you doing?

537
02:16:13,659 --> 02:16:20,119
All right. I'm getting people. People are doing the. OK, whatever. Drop the spear. It's blue.

538
02:16:20,119 --> 02:16:49,879
It's my favorite color. I'm not dropping it. I replaced the five bomb arrows I shot into nothing.

539
02:16:49,879 --> 02:17:07,450
OK, here we go. We're going to keep going up the road, right? Yep. A is not there. I need some more

540
02:17:07,450 --> 02:17:20,280
seeds. Yeah, I need some more seeds to upgrade that inventory. I forgot to blink. All right. So

541
02:17:20,280 --> 02:17:44,840
I'm going to keep going this way. Hopefully this eventually leads to the mountain. I'm going away

542
02:17:44,840 --> 02:18:13,579
from the mountain. Let go of the stick. Trust me. Huh? Are you serious? The horse will steer itself.

543
02:18:13,579 --> 02:18:24,090
I did. Why would I have ever thought that was a thing? Are you serious? Wait, what's over here?

544
02:18:26,819 --> 02:19:25,829
Yep. Stay right there. Stop. Red Choo Choo Jelly. Cool. I do that strategy, man. It doesn't work.

545
02:19:25,829 --> 02:19:33,139
It's my first stream here. I had fun playing this. It's the first game I ever bought. Is that what

546
02:19:33,139 --> 02:19:50,680
you said? I hope so. Yeah, that's great. It's really, really fun. OK, what's in the chest?

547
02:19:50,680 --> 02:20:04,200
It's a hundred bucks. I'll take it. I mean, I'm not going to say no to a hundred dollars, right?

548
02:20:04,200 --> 02:20:17,059
Cool. What else is down here? Some weird down here. Some weird shit down here. I'm getting the

549
02:20:18,389 --> 02:20:49,270
ding ding. I'm getting dings here. Do the new viewer song. I can't do the new viewer song anymore.

550
02:20:49,270 --> 02:20:54,549
Oh, it didn't hit. It hit somebody in there. Oh my God. That's so frustrating. I'm in trouble now.

551
02:20:59,659 --> 02:21:36,969
I can't do the new viewer song anymore. My God. Get out of here. You got a big sword. Where's he

552
02:21:36,969 --> 02:22:46,020
going? Stop. Stop swinging. I cannot even hurt these guys. What the fuck? No, I don't want to

553
02:22:46,020 --> 02:23:08,020
eat any of this food. You know what I mean? I don't want to eat any of the food. It all seems

554
02:23:08,020 --> 02:23:31,670
too important. I don't want to eat this. I'll eat this. OK. All right. Well, that could have gone

555
02:23:31,670 --> 02:23:59,620
way better. That was a good shot. Are you guys trying to punch me in the face? Very good. All

556
02:23:59,620 --> 02:24:07,670
right. Cool. Now let's do it. My God. My goodness. The big sword dropped. Yeah, I'll go get it.

557
02:24:07,670 --> 02:24:30,020
Where did that guy die? All right. Cobble crusher. I think kind of sucks. This thing's almost broken

558
02:24:30,020 --> 02:24:47,299
though. So whatever. Fuck it. I'll use it. What's in the chest? Oh, it can be used as a pickaxe.

559
02:24:48,549 --> 02:25:13,719
Really? Oh, hell yeah. All right. Remind me not to use this for anything besides this. Very cool.

560
02:25:13,719 --> 02:25:26,120
So where should I give it to me? Why are you so short? Because when God made me, he was like,

561
02:25:26,120 --> 02:25:33,319
nah, this guy would be way too powerful. He'd be far too powerful if he was like six one.

562
02:25:33,319 --> 02:25:37,239
Got to think of five, seven. Otherwise, it'd be like, you know, how can you stop this person?

563
02:25:37,239 --> 02:25:44,780
Be unbeatable, unstoppable, you know, whatever. All right. What was in here? I wasn't paying

564
02:25:44,780 --> 02:26:09,290
attention. That's OK. People said not to get rid of the phrenic bow. Oh, this thing's kind of

565
02:26:09,290 --> 02:26:27,670
dumpy, right? Now I've got to find this shrine, wherever it is. Five fire arrows. All right.

566
02:26:27,670 --> 02:26:43,000
I'll take it. That's 10 fire arrows. All right. Nice. It's the only ball that zooms in when you

567
02:26:43,000 --> 02:27:37,049
use it. I think it's in here. I did it. Oh, nice. I've got four of them now. You can do that better.

568
02:27:37,049 --> 02:27:47,180
I probably could, but I don't really feel like it. Where's Frank? Oh, he's up there.

569
02:27:47,739 --> 02:28:16,299
It's definitely in here. It has to be right. Yeah, it's right there. All right. How are we?

570
02:28:16,299 --> 02:28:24,379
Are we just not doing a vote here? Probably not. I don't think we're going to do it every time,

571
02:28:24,379 --> 02:28:35,799
do we? You want to bet? You guys do? Why not? All right. Ten minutes. Ten minutes including

572
02:28:35,799 --> 02:28:43,000
chest. Fine. Ten minutes including chest. From the moment that I skip and I'm able to move.

573
02:28:47,540 --> 02:28:54,459
Five, five, seven. All right. Seven minutes including chest. I'm going to put my headphones

574
02:28:54,459 --> 02:29:02,120
in and just shut the fuck up and do it as best as I can. Seven minutes including the chest.

575
02:29:02,120 --> 02:29:20,729
What do you think? Is that a good time? Make it six? No, it's seven. Seven minutes. Oh,

576
02:29:20,729 --> 02:29:26,629
I can do it. Hold on. I can run it. No, why am I running a poll? I don't know. How do I do it?

577
02:29:26,629 --> 02:29:32,040
How do you do a prediction slash prediction? I actually don't. I like don't know how to do it.

578
02:29:32,040 --> 02:29:38,170
I did it once. Flash prediction. Oh, okay. You're doing it. All right.

579
02:29:38,170 --> 02:29:47,959
I've actually only done it one time. Oh, there we go. Okay. Somebody said they're going all in.

580
02:29:47,959 --> 02:30:16,899
Oh, yeah. I'd be betting if I were you. Lock it in. Locked in. Locked in. That was fast. Yeah.

581
02:30:16,899 --> 02:30:34,809
You got to be fast. Locked in. Let's go. I was too slow. Here we go. All right. It starts.

582
02:30:34,809 --> 02:31:51,930
Not right. Hold on. Not yet. Not yet. Time begins. No, it's I got it. I got it.

583
02:31:52,170 --> 02:33:15,500
I got this. Wait, there's like five chests in here. Oh, burn it. Burn it. Burn it. Burn it.

584
02:33:15,500 --> 02:33:30,180
Burn it. Burn it. Quick. Quick. Quick. Burn it. Burn it. Burn it. Burn it. Burn it. How do I get

585
02:33:30,180 --> 02:33:47,370
in there? I need a key to get in there. Where's the key? Where's the key? Where's the key? Where's

586
02:33:47,370 --> 02:33:53,979
the key? I need a key to get in here. Where's the key? It's going to be one of the boxes.

587
02:35:07,270 --> 02:35:32,329
That's it. I got it right. All of them. That's it. I win. Sorry, guys. Sorry. I had two minutes

588
02:35:32,329 --> 02:35:43,209
to spare. I didn't miss a chest. I don't think. I got them all. Chest in the wall. Chest over there.

589
02:35:43,209 --> 02:35:57,879
I got them all. Chat cheated. They showed you it was a magnet. No, that's not accurate.

590
02:35:57,879 --> 02:36:14,700
Thought about that. It's not rigged. All right. Cool. So let me get back out on the road. What's

591
02:36:14,700 --> 02:36:33,180
that? The mineral? Spam the magnet emote. There is no magnet emote. You. This is the referee.

592
02:36:33,180 --> 02:37:04,979
Ooh. All right. Diamond. I got a diamond. I've got diamonds. Hmm. Okay. Back out to the road,

593
02:37:04,979 --> 02:37:26,780
I think. Right. Back to kind of out here. Reality. Hmm. Frank too. Can't hear you. Why

594
02:37:26,780 --> 02:38:11,370
not? Oh, you're far away. It's going to get back on the road. It's very good. I got to get back up.

595
02:38:11,370 --> 02:38:36,840
Wait a minute. I forget this. Copas and salt. I keep hearing the reverse music. That means

596
02:38:36,840 --> 02:39:01,110
it's going to be a moon, right? All right. Where are you, Frank? Go. Who are you? What's that word?

597
02:39:01,110 --> 02:39:05,540
It's on the tip of my tongue, but I just can't think of it. Starts with L ends in K. What is

598
02:39:05,540 --> 02:39:17,770
it though? Lurk, lick, leak or link? Uh, me? Oh, right. Yes. The Hylian champion. Or so I've heard

599
02:39:17,770 --> 02:39:22,790
somewhere. That's you, right? Your link. You just pretend to not know who I was. That's kind of

600
02:39:22,790 --> 02:39:59,299
weird. Wait. Nice. Stop fucking disappearing. Annoying. Frank, watch out. Frank, get out of

601
02:39:59,299 --> 02:40:34,299
the way. I was going to say that was weird. All right. Now we want to go this way. Yep. Okay.

602
02:40:34,299 --> 02:40:38,709
Keep going down the road. I see anything interesting. I'll stop.

603
02:41:06,620 --> 02:41:47,750
That's interesting enough for me to stop. Nah. Hang a right. Yeah. I'm just going to go down

604
02:41:47,750 --> 02:42:17,030
this road here. Bones. Cause then now I'm going to go yoink that way. Why is it playing this music?

605
02:42:17,030 --> 02:42:26,649
This is definitely one of the- this is a bad guy right here, right? I just set a check.

606
02:42:26,649 --> 02:42:34,010
Looking to buy bananas? You can. Just take a look at these fine bananas. Sure. I'll buy.

607
02:42:42,090 --> 02:42:47,989
I did check. I- okay. I was right. I was literally right. I was right. I knew it. Oh,

608
02:42:47,989 --> 02:43:13,059
whatever. Oh, you piece of shit. Ooh, that's pretty- wow. All right.

609
02:43:24,409 --> 02:43:30,040
I mean, whatever. I'll just use this for now. He sounds like Eric Cartman.

610
02:43:30,680 --> 02:43:42,329
But they're like, nah, nah, nah, these are my cheesy foods. It kind of does. Well,

611
02:43:43,049 --> 02:44:04,579
I don't know what you think about that guy. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Cause if I go up this way,

612
02:44:04,579 --> 02:44:31,819
I'm sure. Yeah. Surely I'll end up in the right spot, right? He's proud of himself. Yeah.

613
02:44:31,819 --> 02:44:59,930
I got to get some of the lingo sometimes. What's this? Oh, I bet he's slacking off.

614
02:44:59,930 --> 02:45:04,149
I mean, what's that? You're dying for some shield surfing action.

615
02:45:05,909 --> 02:45:10,969
Chill out, my man. You don't need to worry about the details.

616
02:45:10,969 --> 02:45:16,790
My best bud is standing over there beneath that tree. He can show you the ropes.

617
02:45:16,790 --> 02:45:37,719
You're going to go up there? Yeah, why not? Finally, shield surfing gang. The shield breakers.

618
02:45:37,719 --> 02:46:00,899
Yeah, this is a chat member. We're shield gang. Shield gang here. Live the experience. Okay.

619
02:46:00,899 --> 02:46:06,819
The night shield is perfect for shredding. I already have one. Isn't that what I have right

620
02:46:06,819 --> 02:46:20,469
now? This is perfect for shredding. Do I have to buy one? Or am I just going to just leave?

621
02:46:29,860 --> 02:47:00,809
Should I just buy it? Just shred. I have to buy one? Well, I have no room. Stop talking.

622
02:47:00,809 --> 02:47:09,540
You keep standing in the same spot. What? I talked to him. I just, I'm, he's saying buy a shield.

623
02:47:09,540 --> 02:47:48,469
Oh, lie down the west of here. All right, let's go. Let's shred it up. How do I do it? ZL jump A.

624
02:47:48,469 --> 02:48:24,280
That's B. Right. Jump. Cool. That it? Thanks for the tip.

625
02:48:24,280 --> 02:48:50,149
There's nothing better than the generic rock song. I love the generic rock song.

626
02:48:50,149 --> 02:48:54,549
That didn't, it's a, and usually it's, when it's on, it's on the piano or regular piano,

627
02:48:54,549 --> 02:48:59,020
not a keyboard. They're like, done, done, done, done, done, done, done, done, done, done, done.

628
02:48:59,020 --> 02:49:06,040
Aren't you 40? No, not yet, but soon. I don't know what you want me to say.

629
02:49:06,920 --> 02:49:27,780
All right, let's go. So we get the tower. Wait, that's a weird rock.

630
02:49:27,780 --> 02:49:50,819
Oh my God. Don't scare me like that. I know I did the red dead joke already,

631
02:49:50,819 --> 02:49:57,559
but I want to just look at him and go. Oh, you're ugly. Hey, I'm just kidding with you.

632
02:49:59,690 --> 02:50:06,489
You know, you look like a dumb son of a gun. I'm just playing around with you.

633
02:50:07,690 --> 02:50:13,479
Why are you being so serious? I do it every time. Wait, what's that?

634
02:50:14,440 --> 02:50:33,110
A stick. You don't like the water, do you? All right. You're good. Very nice job. You're,

635
02:50:33,110 --> 02:50:58,010
look out. I thought he was going to get hit right in the head. He's going to drown. No, he's not.

636
02:50:58,010 --> 02:51:14,860
He's fine. He's not being attacked by a wild animal, right? No, he's, Frank's fine. There's

637
02:51:14,860 --> 02:51:34,489
a weirdo over there though. I'm kind of concerned about that. All right. He's, he's fine. Ooh,

638
02:51:34,489 --> 02:51:44,840
this is stable. Cool. All right. Place your bets. Seven minutes to get the chest as well. I mean,

639
02:51:44,920 --> 02:52:33,020
I can't win every time, right? Wait, what is that? What's the point of this? What does it do? What

640
02:52:33,020 --> 02:52:58,409
should I do with it? Why can I pick this up? It's weird. What purpose? What is the charge?

641
02:52:58,409 --> 02:53:18,040
I don't know. Does it matter? Do I have to do anything with this? I don't get it.

642
02:53:18,760 --> 02:53:32,420
I don't get it. I'll come back later. It's all right. Come back later. All right. Are we betting

643
02:53:32,420 --> 02:53:41,750
or what? Seven minutes and chest. That's locked in. All right. That's pretty 50, 50, really.

644
02:53:41,750 --> 02:53:54,309
Seven minutes with the chest. That's a locked in. Let's go. There's nothing in there. I had to

645
02:53:54,309 --> 02:54:37,290
replace it. All right. So that time begins. Not yet. Okay. All right. All right. All right. Chest,

646
02:54:37,290 --> 02:54:56,920
sledgehammer. Okay. What do we got? What do we got? What do we got? What do we got? What do we got?

647
02:54:56,920 --> 02:55:06,389
What's that do? All right. It goes. What did that do? Okay. It didn't, I don't know. It didn't do

648
02:55:06,389 --> 02:55:13,139
anything. What did that do? What's that sound? I hear like ding. What's that mean? Okay. Let's

649
02:55:13,139 --> 02:55:20,069
throw this and see what happens. Okay. Now what? Okay. It makes, it makes a new one. I got it. Okay.

650
02:55:20,069 --> 02:55:29,350
So what do we do now? We need to, we need, we, but we're all in this. All of us. We, I say we.

651
02:55:29,350 --> 02:55:43,479
What are we going to do? Okay. We are going to, um, what do you mean? No, no, it's we. Oh, I say we.

652
02:55:44,120 --> 02:56:14,170
I'm going to, I don't know. Ice. I'm going to do ice. Um, that you actually do football. You

653
02:56:14,170 --> 02:56:16,889
actually do have to do the football. All right. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

654
02:56:35,059 --> 02:57:14,899
Shit. Okay. Um, yeah. Is that it? Is that not it? This is another one. Or is it another one?

655
02:57:14,899 --> 02:57:23,620
I don't know. Um, wait. Okay. All right. All right. I get it. I know what to do. I know what to do.

656
02:57:23,620 --> 02:57:40,299
Watch this. I get it. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. Ready? Oh, I know too. All right.

657
02:57:40,299 --> 02:57:43,100
That would have killed me. I would have just died. I thought you had to ride on it. I thought you

658
02:57:43,100 --> 02:58:00,069
had to ride on top of it. Okay. We're good. Oops. I just, ow, my fingernail. Okay. I win.

659
02:58:00,069 --> 02:58:04,299
Imagine if I rode on top of that and just got splatted against the wall. That actually

660
02:58:04,299 --> 02:58:08,819
would have been really funny. You didn't get the chest? What do you mean? What? What? What do you

661
02:58:08,819 --> 02:58:24,420
mean not yet? What? What is the chest in here? I didn't get it. Wait. So I gotta get back in.

662
02:58:24,420 --> 02:58:32,569
Where is it? Don't tell me. Okay. Hold on. I'll get it. All right. Four minutes. Three minutes.

663
02:58:32,569 --> 02:58:40,469
All right. Speedrun strategy. Loading screens don't count, right? They like speed runs pause

664
02:58:40,469 --> 02:58:51,719
the timer pauses until you get control of the character back, right? There's a chest in here

665
02:58:51,719 --> 02:59:58,469
that I didn't get. What? Where did that go? Are you fucking kidding me? Oh, good. Fast. That was

666
02:59:58,469 --> 03:00:08,120
fast. That was super. That was fast as fuck. All right. Where's the chest? Where is it? Where's the

667
03:00:08,120 --> 03:00:24,489
chest? Where's the chest? Where's the chest? I don't see anything. I don't see a chest anywhere.

668
03:00:24,489 --> 03:01:44,870
I don't know. I don't know where it is. This shit's hidden in a fucking wall somewhere.

669
03:01:44,870 --> 03:02:10,090
Oh, I don't understand. Is that one there? Then wait a minute. What if I do this? Hold on. I got

670
03:02:10,090 --> 03:02:20,389
an idea. It's probably inside. It's inside of this. Is it? I don't know. Is it inside? It's inside of

671
03:02:20,389 --> 03:02:36,860
this thing. I have to smash it against the wall. It's inside. That's all right. I lose. Where is it?

672
03:02:36,860 --> 03:02:47,159
Where is this chest that's apparently here somewhere? Magnet. Magnet. Yeah, but magnet. What?

673
03:02:47,719 --> 03:03:11,110
Magnet? I don't see anything here. Hold on. Wait. Can I have... Can I hit... Wait a minute. This is

674
03:03:11,110 --> 03:03:39,899
gonna move now. Okay. Then you move it down and that unlocks the next thing. Wait. What? What is

675
03:03:39,899 --> 03:04:22,250
it? Where is this? Well, I got it. All right. Let him out. No. Look at the direction I'm facing. Why

676
03:04:22,250 --> 03:05:31,670
would it do that? Dude. No. You idiot. You idiot. Oh my God. It's gonna be faster than that. This

677
03:05:31,670 --> 03:06:41,829
thing's gonna break. Oh my God. It's so close. It's the one right below the maximum. This thing's

678
03:06:41,829 --> 03:07:41,909
gonna break and then I'll be left with nothing. Oh, what the fuck? How many times? One, two,

679
03:07:42,469 --> 03:09:03,370
three, four, five, six. Five times? Shoot it with an arrow? Stupid asshole. Oh my God.

680
03:09:03,370 --> 03:10:22,469
Oh my God. Just look forward. All right. Here we go. Ready? What the fuck? I'm gonna break all my

681
03:10:22,469 --> 03:10:52,309
weapons, man. All my weapons are gonna break. I'm gonna break every weapon. Hold Y? Yeah. When I

682
03:10:52,309 --> 03:11:09,399
hold Y, I do this barbarian spin and I can't get the right angle. Dude. Hold Y? What are you talking

683
03:11:09,399 --> 03:11:23,739
about, man? Stand still? You can't stand still. Look. Oh, you can stand still. You can stand still.

684
03:11:23,739 --> 03:11:27,620
All right. Time that person up for an hour. I don't want to be looked... I don't want to time

685
03:11:27,620 --> 03:11:49,370
the person up for five minutes. I don't, I don't, I don't get it. How many, how many hits should I

686
03:11:49,370 --> 03:12:18,790
do with the spin? Seven? Seven. Do all of them. I'm out of weapons. I don't want to, I don't want to

687
03:12:18,790 --> 03:12:54,040
break my weapons. Everything's... I broke another one. Oh yeah. It's gotta be good. I thought I was

688
03:12:54,040 --> 03:12:58,440
gonna get like a light sword, like a lightsaber, like a light sword. What the fuck? That was,

689
03:12:58,440 --> 03:13:19,260
what is that word? Not even worth it. It is good. Those are rare. Okay. Well, that was fun. It's

690
03:13:19,260 --> 03:13:38,489
actually a good item. Giant ancient corp hog. If it actually is worth it, then that's cool.

691
03:13:38,489 --> 03:14:14,219
Just warp to the shrine. Teleport. Wait. Oh, I can just leave. Where's he going? What does he look

692
03:14:14,219 --> 03:14:31,739
like this? Why do people ask that every day? People ask that question every single day.

693
03:14:31,739 --> 03:14:34,860
Hey, why does he look like this, man? I don't know. Why do you look like you?

694
03:14:35,899 --> 03:14:56,389
Why do you look like that? Okay. So let's get back on the road. I'll figure that puzzle out later.

695
03:15:01,829 --> 03:15:14,010
I have my elephant recovery. Do that now. Do the puzzle now. I don't even know what to do.

696
03:15:14,010 --> 03:15:23,850
How can I do a puzzle now? Oh, okay. I'm good. I can't, how am I supposed to do it now? Figure

697
03:15:23,850 --> 03:15:29,940
it out. I don't know what it wants me to do. Do what now? All right. Fine. I'll do it now.

698
03:15:37,610 --> 03:15:45,180
Nice tuber reaction. Figure it. I'm gonna drown because somebody was calling me a name in chat

699
03:15:45,180 --> 03:15:55,899
and I looked at it. All right. I have stamina, right? I just don't want to drown. I don't think

700
03:15:55,899 --> 03:16:11,420
I have any stamina food. I think it's over. It's over. I'm gonna drown here. All right. So

701
03:16:11,420 --> 03:16:29,639
what do you want me to do now? So this is a puzzle. Figure it out. It's a puzzle. I mean,

702
03:16:29,639 --> 03:16:36,600
I think I understand what it wants me to do. Let's see if it's as simple as I think it is.

703
03:16:45,719 --> 03:17:21,750
Like a better camera angle, please. You don't just connect it. I figured it was like one,

704
03:17:21,750 --> 03:17:28,700
two, three, four, right? You connect it, connect them all. That has to be what you do. What the

705
03:17:28,700 --> 03:17:43,180
hell is with this before? Can I push it? Okay. That's not what you do. So I guess it's a little

706
03:17:43,180 --> 03:18:05,659
more complicated. Are there any instructions on it? Yes. I know it's a magnet. I understand it's a

707
03:18:05,659 --> 03:18:41,819
magnet. Yes. I currently am using a magnet. I put it through it. I didn't work. I put it through.

708
03:18:41,819 --> 03:18:49,780
I did a field goal and it didn't work. What even is that? I don't even know what that is.

709
03:18:49,780 --> 03:19:13,399
Do I have to swim through it? Wait, there's another one over here.

710
03:20:22,100 --> 03:20:36,739
Was it a typewriter? What is that? What email is this? Copy this. Copy this. Copy this. I don't

711
03:20:36,739 --> 03:20:50,409
know what I copy. Like I have to copy it. Copy this. Copy this. I don't know how do I copy it?

712
03:20:50,969 --> 03:21:09,750
There's no such thing as copy. Should we free them? Yeah, let them out. Let them out. I don't

713
03:21:09,750 --> 03:21:19,110
know. I can't do it. I don't understand it. I don't get it. Copy this. It's a really good hint.

714
03:21:19,110 --> 03:21:35,989
Copy. Copy. Copy this. Do I have to match the other one? But the other one already is. Looks

715
03:21:35,989 --> 03:21:47,530
like that. Where did it go? Yeah, the one already. Oh, wait a minute. That doesn't.

716
03:21:47,530 --> 03:22:02,489
Oh, wait. Hold on. Oh, okay. Oh, okay. Uh huh. I dropped that fucking cube on the ground 30

717
03:22:02,489 --> 03:22:22,870
times over here and it didn't land in that spot. I desperately tried to put it down like five times.

718
03:22:22,870 --> 03:22:31,190
You're stupid. Yeah. Oh, you got to copy the one under there. How would you know that? You didn't

719
03:22:31,190 --> 03:22:42,569
know that. You went to, you went to, uh, you, you went to the extra life dot breath of the wild dot

720
03:22:42,569 --> 03:22:56,540
whatever. And you had to look it up. This is the single most infuriating thing I've ever watched in

721
03:22:56,540 --> 03:23:04,010
my entire life. How is Jerma a functioning human? Cause I didn't see, I didn't see the puzzle

722
03:23:04,010 --> 03:23:23,479
underground. Okay. If, if a live streamer not doing a puzzle correct is the most worst thing

723
03:23:23,479 --> 03:23:38,250
you've ever seen in your life. Whoa. Whoa. That's the worst thing ever you've ever seen.

724
03:23:40,979 --> 03:23:53,959
Holy shit. It started raining. I, it's raining. I can't see shit. It's the second worst thing I've

725
03:23:53,959 --> 03:24:03,719
ever seen. You didn't know where to put the, you didn't know how to take the cube from that place

726
03:24:03,719 --> 03:24:09,799
and put it where the cube goes. How do you put your pants on every day? It's impossible. You know

727
03:24:09,799 --> 03:24:14,040
what? Look, they're on, they're on and they're tied correctly. I know how to tie my shoes too.

728
03:24:14,600 --> 03:24:33,940
To be fair, they didn't have 21,000 chat chimpanzees throwing coffee machines at them.

729
03:24:33,940 --> 03:25:13,350
All right. So let me upgrade my gear. All right. Shields, definitely shields. I don't know how to

730
03:25:13,350 --> 03:25:57,290
tie my pants. It's not hard. Hmm. Again, I think again, two shields. Weapon is three or four. Hey

731
03:25:57,290 --> 03:26:00,819
Jerma, if you're getting stressed by these comments, it's a cigarette joke. Nevermind. All

732
03:26:00,819 --> 03:26:11,719
right. What do we got? We keep going. A weapon is three or four. Okay. I'm going to save it

733
03:26:11,719 --> 03:26:35,020
because I want to do weapon again. Or should it bow? We love you Jerma. We have to guide you to

734
03:26:35,020 --> 03:27:10,729
victory. I'm going to figure it out. Give me a minute. All the route. Hope you enjoy the game.

735
03:27:10,729 --> 03:27:19,430
Take it slow. Okay. For every, for every one person that says enjoy the game and take it slow. Don't

736
03:27:19,430 --> 03:27:25,510
rush. Just take it at your pace. So it's like a one to one to how did he not finish this puzzle

737
03:27:25,510 --> 03:27:52,020
in 10 seconds? Push him, push him to his limits. I don't mind you struggling with a toddler puzzle

738
03:27:52,020 --> 03:27:58,420
as long as you can prove you can dodge a battle act. I just fucked that guy up. How was that? Huh?

739
03:28:00,340 --> 03:28:13,450
How's that for a gamer? Put that in your, in your textbook and go and go learn. All right. Where am

740
03:28:13,450 --> 03:28:37,829
I going? Wrong way. It's weird that all the CEOs of major cigarette companies hang out in Twitch

741
03:28:37,829 --> 03:28:57,260
chats all day. That's so stupid. Does the road split? Should I go this way? Bad marketing.

742
03:29:00,629 --> 03:29:04,440
Just imagine like a cigarette company CEO just sitting there just

743
03:29:05,879 --> 03:29:10,979
like a tank top and his underwear just lying in bed. Just like, Hey, you should, um,

744
03:29:11,700 --> 03:29:43,659
have you ever smoked a cigarette? Cigarette comedians. I'm just, I don't know. I'm tower,

745
03:29:43,659 --> 03:29:52,069
tower, tower. All right. I'm ready. This is going to be sick. And when you couldn't read a clock.

746
03:29:52,069 --> 03:30:00,329
Yeah. Cause I was wicked high. Okay. I'm sorry. What we get, you get where you want me to defend

747
03:30:00,329 --> 03:30:08,180
every bonehead move in a game I've done. I happen to be a little bit on the side. I was a little bit

748
03:30:08,180 --> 03:30:45,909
high at the time. I wasn't even trying to target that guy. Don't die. Holy shit. This weapon is

749
03:30:45,909 --> 03:30:53,180
amazing. I don't want to break it. I will dodge your fucking acts in real life. I will. I swear

750
03:30:53,180 --> 03:30:59,260
to God, I will contact some like martial artist group. And if you get, go to go into like a

751
03:30:59,260 --> 03:31:02,700
martial artist studio and fucking dodge a bunch of weapons on screen. I swear to God,

752
03:31:09,479 --> 03:31:14,600
I will do a, like, I, this is what would happen if I was ever like attacked by an act stream.

753
03:31:23,129 --> 03:31:33,450
Wow. Oh no, that's not that don't do not spoil what the joke would be though.

754
03:31:33,450 --> 03:31:41,450
Come on. Don't do that. Don't spoil the joke. Don't spoil. Do not spoil the joke.

755
03:31:41,450 --> 03:31:57,340
Come on. Biting my lip. Don't spoil the joke. Please. Just wait. Just wait. Just wait.

756
03:32:00,979 --> 03:32:04,180
I okay. I'm going to do this soon. I'm going to do this really soon.

757
03:32:04,819 --> 03:32:12,229
This is not going to take that much time to do. So I'm going to do it very soon.

758
03:32:12,790 --> 03:32:29,930
Was there a chest? Okay. I'm like, this stream is going to be, this stream is going to be funny.

759
03:32:30,729 --> 03:32:33,610
No spoilers. I'm going to do it. I'm going to try to do this like this month.

760
03:32:35,290 --> 03:32:44,840
It's not going to take a whole lot of time to get ready, bro. The tower. All right. Yeah.

761
03:33:07,930 --> 03:33:13,290
Why did I think that it ended right there? All I saw was this and I thought it was the clip

762
03:33:15,190 --> 03:33:29,750
red sky. I'll be fine. And the title of that scream is going to literally be the dodge.

763
03:33:29,750 --> 03:33:37,909
The battle act scream. Okay. I don't, it doesn't need a fancy title. I don't even,

764
03:33:37,909 --> 03:33:40,950
I don't need to, I need to sponsor that stream. It doesn't, I don't have to do that.

765
03:33:41,750 --> 03:33:47,270
I mean, maybe it'd be kind of funny. I don't know. I'm into this now. I swear to God, I'm going to

766
03:33:47,270 --> 03:34:01,829
make it. I'm going to scheme. It's going to be such a fucking scheme. I can't wait. All right.

767
03:34:01,829 --> 03:34:09,700
That's literally, I'm not going to say anything else. All right. I got to just wait because the

768
03:34:09,700 --> 03:34:23,610
blood moon is going to happen, right? And they're going to respond anyways. They're going to respond

769
03:34:23,610 --> 03:35:08,120
anyways. Just whatever. I'll, I'll tell the mods. I was typing. I was typing to the whatever. Okay.

770
03:35:08,120 --> 03:35:26,200
I just, what, what just happened? Is it, I'm very confused. Why is it raining meteors? Is this water

771
03:35:26,200 --> 03:35:42,280
boiling? Who is doing this? Okay. Where, this guy's annoying. This guy's really annoying.

772
03:35:42,280 --> 03:36:03,350
This guy's fucking annoying. Okay. Hold on. Can you be in a spot where I can actually fucking hit you

773
03:36:03,350 --> 03:36:36,200
with a weapon? Oh my God. Give me that thing. Fuck away from me. Ooh. I'll take the fire rod.

774
03:36:36,200 --> 03:36:53,700
Annoying dick. Okay. So is this thing boiling? I think this is burning hot. That's why, right?

775
03:36:57,770 --> 03:37:07,219
Oh, it's quicksand. Okay. You just die if you're going. All right. So now I get it. So I can't go

776
03:37:07,219 --> 03:37:52,549
that way. How do I not have a weapon equipped? See you later. Goodbye. See you later. Hmm.

777
03:37:52,549 --> 03:38:05,379
Would ice actually work here? Is this technically water? Okay. I thought it was sludge or something.

778
03:38:51,610 --> 03:39:28,059
One regular arrow. I don't think I can make this jump. Don't you fucking dare. Oh my God. I panicked

779
03:39:28,059 --> 03:39:53,000
so much from that guy shooting at me. I'm going to just electrify the fucking whole thing. Just

780
03:39:53,000 --> 03:40:00,440
get out of here. Little shit head. No, don't, don't. If you fire at me, I will be very upset.

781
03:40:00,440 --> 03:40:51,879
Don't even think about it. Okay. Now I can do this in peace. Chest over there. Remember the

782
03:40:51,879 --> 03:40:57,159
cigarette CEOs are winning. Don't let them win. Every time you see somebody write about a cigarette

783
03:40:57,159 --> 03:41:03,079
in the chat, I want you to write extra lettuce or something. No. What's like a healthy thing? I don't

784
03:41:03,079 --> 03:41:19,020
know. Exercise regularly. Yeah. All right. So I need to go over that. Is there anything else over

785
03:41:19,020 --> 03:41:32,409
here? What is, what's that for? That'd be a reason, right? What's this here? This is a weird thing.

786
03:41:32,409 --> 03:42:04,840
Just be sitting right here. Ooh. I'll take that. Sleeping. This thing's broken anyways. So just

787
03:42:04,840 --> 03:42:33,219
drop it. Wasn't it a Knight's bow in there? Okay. I'm going to head back there. Ooh. Can I even break

788
03:42:33,219 --> 03:43:26,840
this though? Oh wait, I have bombs. Hell yeah. Power time. Woodland power. Okay. Can I just climb

789
03:43:26,840 --> 03:44:07,340
it? I think so. All right. Find out something up there too. I can't wait for this stream. It's all

790
03:44:07,340 --> 03:44:37,899
I can think about right now. Am I going to make it? I don't think so. Dude. What? That's impossible.

791
03:44:37,899 --> 03:44:56,659
I fell in the pixel perfect place to die. This has got to be a different hold on. I have to just

792
03:44:56,659 --> 03:45:11,540
climb this. I don't think I can even make it. I don't have stamina. Wait, drink a climb potion.

793
03:45:11,540 --> 03:45:16,020
You wouldn't have been able to do that if you tried to do that. You genuinely would not have

794
03:45:16,020 --> 03:45:19,540
been able to do what I just did if you tried to like a hundred times over and over again. It's

795
03:45:21,049 --> 03:45:39,299
honest to God. I don't think you'd be able to do that. You can't throw shit, right? You can.

796
03:45:45,129 --> 03:45:50,729
What? I thought the rock boomerang didn't hit me. I thought the rock boomerang didn't hit me.

797
03:45:51,530 --> 03:46:02,760
It's you. Oh my God. No. Oh my God. I just got the full heal thing. I'm okay. I'm fucking done.

798
03:47:26,709 --> 03:48:05,379
Jerma's not here anymore. My name is extra lettuce. He's smoking a cigarette under the shirt.

799
03:49:03,690 --> 03:49:52,500
Did I get? Did I do it? I hear the music. Nice. Nice. New area unlocked. I don't know. I don't

800
03:49:52,500 --> 03:50:24,760
know about. I can see stinks in there. I had to come out. Okay. So we're that's cool. I'm kidding.

801
03:50:24,760 --> 03:50:31,610
I smell fine. All right. So this is a great Hyrule forest. Weird. Let me actually take a quick look.

802
03:50:41,850 --> 03:51:00,120
You want to know what I actually smell like? Let's see. Uh, cigarettes. Oh yeah. I'm sorry.

803
03:51:00,120 --> 03:51:11,479
Lettuce. Don't smoke cigarettes. Seriously. Don't smoke cigarettes. Don't. Don't do it. Eat. Get

804
03:51:11,479 --> 03:51:16,920
healthy and exercise and eat radishes and shit and like drink water and you know, whatever,

805
03:51:16,920 --> 03:51:21,319
but don't, don't smoke cigarettes. It's really not good, but you know, you're going to do what

806
03:51:21,319 --> 03:51:27,819
you're going to do. I can't stop you, but don't if you can, but you try to quit, you know, or reduce.

807
03:51:32,649 --> 03:51:49,350
What the fuck is that? What is this? What the fuck is this? This is an AI image.

808
03:51:49,350 --> 03:51:56,040
They just, okay, I need to show this. They extended that image with AI. That's insane.

809
03:52:05,180 --> 03:52:36,200
Why is this a thing? What does this mean? What does this mean? What does this mean? What?

810
03:52:38,809 --> 03:52:58,120
That's what I'm holding down here. Is it a Nintendo Wii back there? It's a fortune teller.

811
03:52:59,270 --> 03:53:23,000
It looks like you're about to do an alt. Oh my God. Are those my legs? Are these my legs on the

812
03:53:23,000 --> 03:53:52,780
right? Am I sitting with like jeans on? No, no, no, no. I'm in like a beanbag chair. Oh my God.

813
03:53:52,780 --> 03:54:03,420
Post-apocalyptic human lettuce mutant. You're bigger than the chair. I didn't even look. What?

814
03:54:11,989 --> 03:54:23,239
What the shit? I don't understand. I think I'm sitting in a beanbag chair.

815
03:54:23,239 --> 03:54:29,420
Why is there a Wii? I mean, there is, there is a Wii. There is a Wii. So that's actually there.

816
03:54:29,420 --> 03:54:53,989
Okay. Let me take a look. There's some shrines probably out here. I don't see any shrines

817
03:54:53,989 --> 03:55:17,590
actually. Hello? Are we good? I hope so. I don't see anything. I don't think there's any shrines

818
03:55:17,590 --> 03:55:32,459
that way. Go back here. Hard to tell. Okay. Cool. I can go up that way. Can I get up there that way?

819
03:55:35,219 --> 03:55:57,940
Okay. Climb up one. Climb the skull. Climb the skull. Climb the skull. I missed it.

820
03:56:03,290 --> 03:56:25,209
I just want to see what's over here. I can always teleport. Oh wow. That's cool. Go to the woods. I

821
03:56:25,209 --> 03:56:37,340
will. I just want to see what's over here. Stop rushing me in my playthrough. Derma, you're not

822
03:56:37,340 --> 03:56:48,250
doing puzzles fast enough. Derma, climb the skull. This is my playthrough. I'm going to go where I

823
03:56:48,250 --> 03:57:08,729
want to go. You got your playthrough. I get my, it's my playthrough and I want macaroni and cheese

824
03:57:08,729 --> 03:57:33,819
for dinner and an egg. Just one cooked. No, I want McDonald's. My playthrough. I get to decide what

825
03:57:33,819 --> 03:58:07,670
food I have to. Baby. Spoiled. Ow. What happened? Oh, it's heat. Put it out. Okay. So this is made

826
03:58:07,670 --> 03:58:23,510
out of wood. So get rid of it. Ooh. Go fight already. Am I just going to get burned if I walk

827
03:58:23,510 --> 03:58:32,569
over here though? Does this hurt? Okay. The air hurts. So hold on. I specifically made food for

828
03:58:32,569 --> 03:58:55,700
this exact purpose. Although my brain's itching. Okay. So this is 10 minutes of fire proof. Is

829
03:58:55,700 --> 03:59:18,040
this a good idea? Yeah. You can swim in the lava. Yeah. All right. What else is on fire? Something's

830
03:59:18,040 --> 03:59:27,299
burning. Oh, it's me. Oh, yikes. It's me. Right? Come on. I've seen this episode a million times.

831
03:59:29,299 --> 03:59:37,860
How do I, does it matter? I'm just going to try to get over there or whatever.

832
03:59:43,770 --> 04:00:19,700
Ooh. Crunchies. Put the bow away. I switched the bow. What? Ice rod. Now I'm decked out. Okay.

833
04:00:19,700 --> 04:00:33,239
I'm here. Cool. Should I grab anything? I think I have to just get up here, right? You're in the

834
04:00:33,239 --> 04:00:38,860
volcano for fuck's sake. I know. Dude, I'm trying to figure out how to get in here. I'm on a time

835
04:00:38,860 --> 04:00:51,850
limit. I can't really stick around. Yeah. What's that? Water. I hear water. Oh Lord. Okay. I don't

836
04:00:51,850 --> 04:01:10,440
have much time. Um, I wonder if there's a place where I'm safe from the fire or something. Whoa.

837
04:01:10,440 --> 04:01:28,819
What is this? Yep. Hold on. I don't have time to explore that. How do I go? Um, where should I go?

838
04:01:28,819 --> 04:02:08,100
I don't know. I'm just going to keep going this way. Where's your flame guard?

839
04:02:08,100 --> 04:03:12,920
Unk. Oh, really? Where? Where is it? Oh, it's a chameleon. How am I going to actually be able

840
04:03:12,920 --> 04:03:32,120
to get up there in 10 minutes? That's a good question. Oh, hey, what's up? What's going on

841
04:03:32,120 --> 04:03:40,120
city? All right. Cool. Well, looky here. Welcome master link. How did you know? What do you mean?

842
04:03:40,120 --> 04:03:45,190
More importantly, I hope you made it past all those magma bombs without injury. To be honest,

843
04:03:45,190 --> 04:03:48,069
we haven't had many visitors here since those magma bombs started falling from the sky.

844
04:03:49,209 --> 04:03:54,090
I'd be bored to tears if I didn't pass the time pretending to greet the long lost Hylian champion.

845
04:03:54,090 --> 04:04:00,549
Heh. Oh, in case you didn't know, uh, link is the little Hylian who fought alongside the

846
04:04:00,549 --> 04:04:05,540
Goron champion Daruk. You want to hear more? Talk to the boss. He lives further in town.

847
04:04:06,180 --> 04:04:13,719
Am I safe in here? No, it's like a million degrees. I didn't mean, did I hit you with that?

848
04:04:14,440 --> 04:04:27,989
Am I actually, uh, well, I die in six minutes. Maybe I can buy like a flame suit from town here.

849
04:04:27,989 --> 04:04:50,809
I bet you I can. I'd be shocked if you couldn't. Who sells this armor? That blasted Rudania.

850
04:04:50,809 --> 04:04:55,829
With Rudania running wild recently, Death Mountain's eruptions have gotten real bad.

851
04:04:56,549 --> 04:05:03,049
Do you see Rudania stomping around up there on the mountain? They say that a hundred years ago,

852
04:05:03,049 --> 04:05:08,020
it actually used to protect our people from harm. But that was then and this is now. Now all it does

853
04:05:08,020 --> 04:05:12,020
is mess up our mining operations. We're all suffering because it's stopping us from doing

854
04:05:12,020 --> 04:05:19,899
business. Can't tell you how many times we've used the cannon to chase off that fiend. But it

855
04:05:19,899 --> 04:05:30,709
always comes back. Oh. Ouch. Ow. Just some back pain. Wait, who are you? I see. So then you came

856
04:05:30,709 --> 04:05:36,010
all this way to pay your respects to me. I like you already, brother. Well, my name's Bluto.

857
04:05:37,020 --> 04:05:43,020
I'm the great Goron boss who's fearsome enough to silence a crying child or to make a silent child

858
04:05:43,020 --> 04:05:50,920
cry either way. Yes, it's none other than I, Bluto. I was planning on a drive off Rudania,

859
04:05:50,920 --> 04:05:58,389
like I always do. But then this blasted pain in my back flared up out of nowhere. Blasted

860
04:05:58,389 --> 04:06:05,110
Yunovo. When will he return? Yunovo is a young Goron who helps me drive off

861
04:06:05,110 --> 04:06:13,020
Rudania. He went to grab some painkillers from my back room out of the abandoned North Mine.

862
04:06:13,579 --> 04:06:24,329
Really hasn't come back yet. Slacker. I bet. Hey, I'm gonna see Yunovo. Let him know I'm looking for

863
04:06:25,690 --> 04:06:44,840
Goku. Ah, oh ouch. Okay. I need to buy armor. He said the thing. Oh, yay. He said it.

864
04:06:50,840 --> 04:07:03,030
That's the one thing I have not retired, right? I keep doing the Mr. Satan. I just won't stop it.

865
04:07:04,709 --> 04:07:24,200
Okay, there is, okay, right here. I got a lot of money. Should be good, right? Okay.

866
04:07:32,100 --> 04:07:41,530
Oh, right. Here we go. All right. Flame Breaker Armor. It's made fire-resistant rocks to protect

867
04:07:41,530 --> 04:07:55,340
the wear. How much is it? 600? I need it. Cool. Now, what about the other stuff? Flame Guard sits

868
04:07:55,340 --> 04:08:04,920
700. If I just have one piece, is that okay? Would you need the whole set? I need the whole set. No

869
04:08:04,920 --> 04:08:24,170
way. I have a lot of gems. I should probably go upgrade it too though, right? I need at least two.

870
04:08:24,809 --> 04:08:32,409
Two out of three will protect you. Okay. What's the cheapest one? I probably should get the pants

871
04:08:33,049 --> 04:09:03,020
and upgrade it. The one piece is real. Okay. This is 2000. What? Why is that so expensive?

872
04:09:05,129 --> 04:09:23,020
Excuse me? I need to go to the forest area and upgrade this. This is a three armor. Are you

873
04:09:23,020 --> 04:09:34,260
kidding me? That's terrible. Yeah, I'm getting out of here. I do need to get to a shrine first,

874
04:09:35,059 --> 04:09:42,139
which I think is probably one here. I'm not staying. I need to find the shrine so I can

875
04:09:42,139 --> 04:10:05,420
teleport back here. You need the helmet. Where's the shrine? Above? I need a place to teleport to

876
04:10:06,059 --> 04:11:00,629
because I can't teleport to over here yet. The shrine. You don't need the helmet. You only need

877
04:11:00,629 --> 04:11:28,620
one piece. The one piece is real, I suppose. What's this? God damn it. Don't just get rid of it.

878
04:11:28,940 --> 04:11:51,000
Look at that up there. I'm trying to find the shrine. I'm going up here. It's definitely up.

879
04:11:51,000 --> 04:13:07,260
Has to be. You stupid Mega Man enemy. I hate those things. Where is it? Can I move this?

880
04:13:07,260 --> 04:13:55,799
Let's go. That was fun. There it is. Yes. Shrine time. What do we think? Seven minutes with the

881
04:13:55,799 --> 04:14:11,370
chest. Hello? What was that? Oh, it's you. Seven minutes with the chest. I think that sounds pretty

882
04:14:11,370 --> 04:14:40,700
good. So to me, I didn't touch anything. I was resting my leg. I got the armor. It's on right

883
04:14:40,700 --> 04:15:00,280
now. Look. He's looking right at me. I didn't like that. That was weird. All right. Get it in.

884
04:15:00,280 --> 04:15:11,770
Let's go. You know the deal. Right when I get control of the character. One second. Go. Get

885
04:15:11,770 --> 04:15:22,979
those bets in. I'm going to concentrate. I'm not going to talk. Here we go. Get them in. What is

886
04:15:22,979 --> 04:16:16,809
it? Here we... I need fire. I need fire. Make our own. Okay. All right. Chest. Stone. Holy shit. Is

887
04:16:16,809 --> 04:16:52,780
that 42 damage? Goodness. This thing is insane. Okay. I got that. Now we need to burn something.

888
04:16:52,780 --> 04:17:45,370
All right. I don't know why I did that, but I did it. Guardian sword. Chest. Okay. That's two chests

889
04:17:45,370 --> 04:18:27,209
down. Take a look over here. I know what to do about this. I think. Uh huh. Nevermind. Go this

890
04:18:27,209 --> 04:18:46,940
way. Key. I need a key. This place is huge. How am I ever going to do this in seven minutes?

891
04:18:46,940 --> 04:19:08,979
This place is enormous, guys. How was I supposed to ever do this? Why did I just do that?

892
04:19:08,979 --> 04:19:20,780
Whatever. This place is enormous. It's enormous. There's no way I was going to get this done.

893
04:19:20,780 --> 04:19:41,190
Not a chance in hell. Don't. Congratulations to everybody. This is the longest dungeon I've done

894
04:19:41,190 --> 04:20:06,090
so far. Don't roll off. What is stopping? Stay here. Don't fucking move. I didn't know you could

895
04:20:06,090 --> 04:21:08,870
even do that. Okay. Now. All right. I got the right idea. Whatever. Fuck it. I got the right

896
04:21:08,870 --> 04:21:20,469
idea. You might as well pay out the people that bet against it because there's no way I'm going

897
04:21:20,469 --> 04:22:04,100
to do this. Wait. I don't even need to do that anymore. Hold on. Oops. Okay. Cool. Key. Wait a

898
04:22:04,100 --> 04:22:12,149
minute. How much time? What do I have? Time? What's my time? What's my time? What's my time?

899
04:22:12,149 --> 04:23:17,399
What's my time? Not even close. Congratulations. You won. What does this do? Okay. I can't grab

900
04:23:17,399 --> 04:23:57,350
that. No. What? Why did it want me to come down? What was it for? What was that even for? Okay.

901
04:23:57,350 --> 04:24:05,850
Do I need to do anything else over there? I mean I need to get the barrel. I'm just going to burn

902
04:24:05,850 --> 04:24:21,610
it but I can't like yank it. I mean technically I could. Does this work? Can I just break it?

903
04:24:21,610 --> 04:24:35,479
I could hit it with a sword or something. Arrows? I could just shoot it with a fire arrow. I don't

904
04:24:35,479 --> 04:24:41,930
have any arrows. I mean I'm just going to. Will the bomb work? Does the bomb cause fire? I don't

905
04:24:41,930 --> 04:25:05,829
think I've ever tested this. Okay that worked. Oh my god. It was literally right here. So many

906
04:25:05,829 --> 04:25:12,389
people are probably just going like just shoot it. Shoot it with a fucking arrow. Just screaming

907
04:25:12,389 --> 04:25:20,950
and they lost all their points. I'm sitting here like oh puzzle. Okay so like oh oh yeah put that

908
04:25:20,950 --> 04:25:48,309
over there. Oh yeah then move that and no that's I just shoot with an arrow. Dude you suck. Hey

909
04:25:49,399 --> 04:25:58,360
close it. Close this. Close this. I don't want to hear it. I don't want to. I don't even want to

910
04:25:58,360 --> 04:26:14,219
hear it. Pay him up. Pay him up. Pay him up. You over thought that so much. Yep I don't know. I

911
04:26:14,219 --> 04:26:17,420
think it's like oh it's a puzzle. I gotta be careful. What if I get it wrong and chat goes oh

912
04:26:19,020 --> 04:26:22,780
I'm just I don't know. I'm thinking about people thinking I'm stupid and then I just don't shoot

913
04:26:22,780 --> 04:26:39,739
it with an arrow. Did I get the chest? I got all the chests right? So I have a teleport now. Wait

914
04:26:39,739 --> 04:26:47,719
let me let me check over here. You just killed those birds. I didn't. You are a monster.

915
04:26:48,360 --> 04:27:04,149
All right I promise I wouldn't scream today. Hello. So many people out and about. You should

916
04:27:04,149 --> 04:27:13,219
know it gets much harder past here. There are also lots of monsters. It's dangerous. This is

917
04:27:13,219 --> 04:27:21,510
the abandoned north mine. Oh and this is the little ditty we all used to sing as we worked.

918
04:27:21,510 --> 04:27:29,270
Ammo goes boom till ore fills the room. Gather said ore for rupees galore. Dig all day to get

919
04:27:29,270 --> 04:27:52,469
the good pay. That's a pretty good song. Oh there's more. You get the idea. You gotta put your

920
04:27:52,469 --> 04:28:04,579
stand up. You gotta put your hands up. What stranger like you asking about Unobo? The boss

921
04:28:04,579 --> 04:28:13,659
wants to know. What? Okay. I went to the vault to fetch some painkillers but now that you mentioned

922
04:28:13,659 --> 04:28:25,659
it I suppose he never came back. It's dangerous. Don't go looking for him. Okay. Vine beast va

923
04:28:25,659 --> 04:28:33,129
Rudania. All right. Cool cool cool cool cool cool cool. All right I need to get the heck out of

924
04:28:33,129 --> 04:28:50,809
here because I want to upgrade the the gear. That was where? Down here right? No no no no no.

925
04:28:50,809 --> 04:29:21,959
Over here? Right here right? Pagariko yep. Did you already add germa turtle? That was quick. Oh from

926
04:29:21,959 --> 04:29:28,680
when I started singing to when the singing stopped I lost 400 sub. I'm just kidding I made

927
04:29:28,680 --> 04:29:56,180
that up. I made it up. I'm kidding. So what does it take to upgrade this gear? I wonder. What am I

928
04:29:56,180 --> 04:30:25,000
going to be for Halloween? Um a turtle. Shit. All right I need fireproof lizards. What do I get

929
04:30:25,000 --> 04:30:35,639
those? Did I ever take a picture of those? Aren't they kind of just running around outside? You said

930
04:30:35,639 --> 04:30:50,329
you're going to be a pineapple. They're all okay so I gotta go back there. Buy more from beetle?

931
04:30:50,329 --> 04:31:09,510
Okay. I've seen them run around as they catch them. How much longer are you going to stream for?

932
04:31:10,309 --> 04:31:16,760
Um I don't know. Maybe like an hour or two. I definitely will at the very least get inside of

933
04:31:16,760 --> 04:31:24,100
the divine beast area right? Okay looking for lizards. If I see a lizard I want to take a

934
04:31:24,100 --> 04:32:03,670
picture of it. Get the camera ready. Lizards. I'm just looking. I'm just scanning the ground.

935
04:32:03,670 --> 04:33:48,700
I'm just trying to see if I can see any. See any? That didn't count. There we go. Nice. Okay. What

936
04:33:48,700 --> 04:34:32,490
the fuck? All right. How many do I need? I need 12. That's a lot. Oh I don't want to watch that.

937
04:34:32,490 --> 04:35:12,900
Uh okay down here. I don't okay. I can't go there. You're gonna scare the fish. Get out of here. I

938
04:35:12,900 --> 04:37:38,459
don't see one. Oh wait right here? No. How many do I need? Two or three or four? Just two? I need

939
04:37:38,459 --> 04:37:48,810
nine more. I don't have the materials to even make it. You only need two with your current

940
04:37:48,810 --> 04:38:14,119
upgrade kit. All right so I'm good then. Let's do two. Okay that makes sense. Do you have the

941
04:38:14,119 --> 04:38:32,869
strategy guide open on another monitor? Uh dude shut up. Um shut up. Shut the fuck up. All right

942
04:38:32,869 --> 04:39:21,209
so let's go do this. Omega lull. It's such a classic song. All right this will go to five.

943
04:39:23,340 --> 04:39:51,509
It's not that much. Better than nothing. Better than nothing. Could I do this again?

944
04:39:51,830 --> 04:40:04,419
Mm-hmm. Oh wait. I am so dumb. I okay. Do you know why? Because it was in the same slot. So I was

945
04:40:04,419 --> 04:40:21,340
like wait I can't. No because it was literally the same spot and it moved. If you got all the

946
04:40:21,340 --> 04:40:26,779
chests in a shrine there should be a chest icon near or on the shrine's map. Oh all right. That's

947
04:40:26,779 --> 04:40:35,209
good to know. Do I have anything? Can I do anything else? I guess I could do this. Am I going to

948
04:40:35,209 --> 04:40:43,990
utilize this again? Try to just do it while I'm here. Yeah probably. Not worth it. Oh because I

949
04:40:44,069 --> 04:41:05,400
already. I mean not really. Just kind of a swimming. All right cool. Let's. I have plenty of healing.

950
04:41:05,400 --> 04:41:16,259
I got tons of food and shit. So I think I'll be all right. So let me head to uh the divine beast.

951
04:41:16,259 --> 04:41:25,700
See how it goes. Post the tweet draft. You know what? I think I still copy and pasted it. Let me

952
04:41:25,700 --> 04:41:37,349
see. Yeah no it's yeah literally still copy. It's still on my clipboard. We were talking about the

953
04:41:37,349 --> 04:41:41,509
adult happy meal that I was like wait how is that. There's an adult happy meal coming out or

954
04:41:41,509 --> 04:41:44,069
something. And I was like what does that even mean? It's just a regular meal. That's what an

955
04:41:44,069 --> 04:41:50,549
adult happy meal is. And we were talking about like what the hell would even be in it. And I

956
04:41:50,549 --> 04:41:57,659
was going to write a tweet that said uh the adult happy meal colon one single can of Bud Light,

957
04:41:57,659 --> 04:42:03,979
two cigarettes, a 10-piece nugget, and three business cards. One for a landscaping company,

958
04:42:03,979 --> 04:42:20,919
one for a CPA, and one for a real estate agent. I'm gonna put it in the draft. I thought I put it

959
04:42:20,919 --> 04:42:38,569
in the draft. You know I'll launder it for a while. Honestly though what is what what is in

960
04:42:38,569 --> 04:42:48,200
the adult happy meal? I'm imagining a bunch of businessmen in suits going to McDonald's and

961
04:42:48,200 --> 04:43:09,610
getting happy meals rather than going out for drinks. What's in it? It's so funny how this is

962
04:43:09,610 --> 04:43:14,330
rated E for everyone but Mario Odyssey technically isn't because it has a tank. What? Is that real?

963
04:43:15,130 --> 04:43:26,950
Dude it's just a solid gold bar. That's I don't even know that's like a funny joke I guess. But

964
04:43:26,950 --> 04:43:30,310
like what are you that's like so outrageous I don't even I can't even laugh at that. Like

965
04:43:30,310 --> 04:43:46,979
what is that what are you talking about? Why would there be a solid gold bar in a fucking happy meal?

966
04:43:46,979 --> 04:44:19,349
Oh is there a better way to go here? Oh wait oh no no no I turn this off this is just for the

967
04:44:19,349 --> 04:44:40,889
lizards right yeah okay is there a oh I can't do ice over here right I got that I didn't even

1039
05:16:51,430 --> 05:16:59,880
I can't make it from there okay I honestly did not think I could make it that far I was like this

1040
05:16:59,880 --> 05:17:05,990
there was no chance in my brain that that was gonna make it I didn't even want to attempt it

1041
05:17:05,990 --> 05:17:11,939
because it was like it's not possible like there's no way you can go that far that was just a that

1042
05:17:11,939 --> 05:17:18,169
was a complete thought oh throw the torch that was the first thing I thought of and it's like oh

1043
05:17:18,169 --> 05:17:23,369
okay no no way no chance in hell it's not possible it just physically isn't possible

1044
05:17:24,090 --> 05:17:50,810

1064
05:24:56,840 --> 05:25:13,819
like this you know the one the very end either the very end of the right side or the very end

1065
05:25:13,819 --> 05:25:21,669
of the left side because you just press it hard ones on the left and it's a scary noise and then

1066
05:25:21,669 --> 05:25:28,970
you go to the right and you do the last two notes into just one two one two one two one two and it

1067
05:25:28,970 --> 05:26:32,459
could be something magical or somebody sneaking along like this you know or just do the shrine

1068
05:26:32,459 --> 05:26:57,849
all right if I stand up am I dead I can't stand up I can't stand up I couldn't even hear what that

1069
05:26:57,849 --> 05:27:06,599
sounded like because I'm plugged in I'm listening to the switch audio not the desktop audio drop

1070
05:27:06,599 --> 05:27:10,759
the frames I know it's because I don't know for some reason every time I try to stream at eight

1071
05:27:10,759 --> 05:27:43,369
o'clock to nine p.m. I have issues I don't care it's fine all right we're good I am gonna eat

1072
05:27:43,369 --> 05:28:11,319
though very cool so let's do this imagine that's the thing to do bye and imagine if I had arrows I

1073
05:28:11,319 --> 05:28:53,930
would have just beat it 60 that thing is so so good uh okay two chests up here oh all right

1074
05:28:53,930 --> 05:29:11,220
that's cool big flame sword these are really really good items for just kind of walking up here

1075
05:29:14,360 --> 05:29:37,400
okay I don't have the torch anymore rate this game out of 10 I know you people keep asking me

1076
05:29:37,400 --> 05:30:38,779
to do that but wait oh this water spraying oh shit okay um hold on um wait hold on a second okay

1077
05:30:38,779 --> 05:32:10,310
all right uh well I have an idea then at the same time oh wait okay okay um okay okay

1078
05:32:10,310 --> 05:32:30,360
I'm gonna be streaming for windows 94 computer what does that mean we're good oh wait a minute

1079
05:32:30,360 --> 05:32:38,409
there's a lot of chests in this one I was never gonna do this in seven minutes

1080
05:32:38,409 --> 05:33:00,630
horse dweller sword I think it's time to get rid of this 22 damage it's good I'm running out of

1081
05:33:00,630 --> 05:33:34,810
shitty weapons to care about do not care about oh burn all right cool guardian spirit oh my

1082
05:33:34,810 --> 05:33:45,939
goodness I can't pick any of these up um shit I don't know what to do I guess I could get rid

1083
05:33:45,939 --> 05:33:54,580
of this what's better you're lagging I know it doesn't matter I I guess I'll get rid of the

1084
05:33:54,580 --> 05:33:59,529
get rid of the fire rod yeah it's cool but

1085
05:33:59,610 --> 05:34:22,779
what guardian spear ancient battleaxe 30 versus okay now this is probably it's 30 damage

1086
05:34:23,419 --> 05:34:33,659
everything else is good maybe get rid of the cobble crusher and pick up the

1087
05:34:33,659 --> 05:34:48,700
sword guardian sword is 20 versus yeah no heavy weapons suck keep whatever you like I like the

1088
05:34:48,700 --> 05:34:54,139
fast weapons the might you but what about mining oh you're right yeah I forgot about the mining

1089
05:34:54,139 --> 05:35:22,459
that's true that's true what on earth hmm this is interesting how am I gonna do this

1090
05:35:22,459 --> 05:36:04,700
oh shit I'm in trouble here I don't think I can make it use the sword the wooden sword I just

1091
05:36:04,700 --> 05:36:11,479
got it though this thing's cool this thing I'm burning this thing this thing's awesome

1092
05:36:51,560 --> 05:37:11,779
got it frames are dropping frames are dropping you honestly I wonder why between eight and nine

1093
05:37:11,779 --> 05:37:19,060
pm sometimes specific and then it's fine it's fine all day fine after I wonder what's going on

1094
05:37:21,270 --> 05:37:26,549
well I mean uh all the eu fans will tell me this is the great idea to just stream an hour or two

1095
05:37:26,549 --> 05:37:35,610
earlier that's the thing higher traffic shouldn't matter I have I have fiber I have a gigabit line

1096
05:37:35,610 --> 05:37:42,790
that I don't share a connection with anybody else so it shouldn't matter I don't have I don't

1097
05:37:42,790 --> 05:37:55,369
share like a node with a neighborhood or anything I do not share a node sorry it's me chewing on

1098
05:37:55,369 --> 05:38:16,950
your internet wire oh well stop a giga line yeah I'd say I have a giga chad line all right let

1099
05:38:16,950 --> 05:39:24,409
me move this is that correct up there that's fun I'm gonna go um turn in that main quest

1100
05:39:24,970 --> 05:39:35,049
yeah but it's super strange I really don't really have an answer because um technically speaking

1101
05:39:35,049 --> 05:39:41,240
in a technical sense it's not like oh it's peak hours you should that's it happens it shouldn't

1102
05:39:41,240 --> 05:39:48,520
be I like I said gigabit to I have a gigabit to the street so I don't there's no sharing of

1103
05:39:48,520 --> 05:39:56,580
the internet with the node or whatever um and it's perfect it's bad for like 40 minutes between like

1104
05:39:56,580 --> 05:40:09,020
8 20 and like 9 it's weird something with the way the traffic is hopping from like 8 pm to 9 pm

1105
05:40:09,580 --> 05:40:17,189
it just hates it I don't know well I don't want to get upset about it I know that I always go on

1106
05:40:17,189 --> 05:40:20,950
these are kind of tangents where it's like I don't know I don't know I let me I let me talk

1107
05:40:20,950 --> 05:40:24,470
let's talk about it again let me go over like 40 straight minutes of why the internet's not

1108
05:40:24,470 --> 05:40:43,590
um it's gonna play it's all right it's what it is it is what it is it'll get better okay here's

1109
05:40:43,590 --> 05:41:12,630
the reward that's a pretty good reward see that statue um I can't uh we can we move out of the

1110
05:41:12,630 --> 05:41:32,409
way oh all right back when I was in high school we literally had squirrels munch on our lines

1111
05:41:33,849 --> 05:41:37,450
that's so that sucks but that's like so funny for some reason

1112
05:41:55,450 --> 05:42:00,009
let those other champions know they better eat their gravel and want to keep up with the roof

1113
05:42:01,049 --> 05:42:09,099
speaking of which can you believe this you just look at all those delectable rocks sprinkled on

1114
05:42:09,099 --> 05:42:16,950
those mountains mighty tasty I may not know a whole lot about this calamity cannon thing

1115
05:42:17,830 --> 05:42:24,150
but mark my words I'll protect this land of ours to the death right little guys

1116
05:42:25,750 --> 05:42:33,509
they could have killed me hey by the way congrats on becoming the princess's appointed knight

1117
05:42:33,509 --> 05:42:43,110
that's a really big deal protecting the king's daughter no pressure seriously though the

1118
05:42:43,110 --> 05:42:49,430
princess is a strong personality so strong she can't quite see the range for the peaks

1119
05:42:49,430 --> 05:43:20,709
remember that and you'll be fine so what was I saying that was a little strange as far as I

1120
05:43:20,709 --> 05:43:29,459
know death mountain has been quiet for decades but if the mountain is shivering enough to send

1121
05:43:29,459 --> 05:43:33,939
down a bunch of boulders that size then never mind forget I said anything

1122
05:43:51,369 --> 05:44:07,209
it's gotten into you highly ensure our strange anyway you know but he's actually descendant of

1123
05:44:07,209 --> 05:44:16,009
the great Daruk okay that's why that slacker can even use Daruk's protection he's to protect

1124
05:44:16,009 --> 05:44:21,610
himself when we fire at rudania that's the only way we can chase that blasted beast away

1125
05:44:21,610 --> 05:44:31,000
we have no choice because normal cannonballs are no good against him all right that's enough

1126
05:44:31,000 --> 05:44:46,229
out of me time to go drive off rudania oh gosh are you okay yeah just peachy dumb traveler of

1127
05:44:46,229 --> 05:44:53,880
course I'm not okay oh wow I'm afraid I won't be going anywhere today I hate to put you on the

1128
05:44:53,880 --> 05:44:58,119
spot but can you please go tell it you know both that I'm gonna have to cancel for today

1141
05:48:00,939 --> 05:48:24,299
I just go full on stamina I'm doing it it's probably a mistake but whatever he's gonna be

05:48:24,299 --> 05:49:08,729
gone for 12 days what's this you look like Minecraft Steve he has a blue shirt what are

06:51:10,340 --> 06:51:15,619
because i look over a chat and i make up a scenario that is not even close like oh dorito

1283
06:51:15,619 --> 06:51:20,259
dorito tornado all right so that means like this guy there's a piece of cheese on the ground

I started the Doritos spam and it did not mean cheese dust particles

1367
07:09:58,700 --> 07:10:01,029

All right. Good night guys. See you soon
