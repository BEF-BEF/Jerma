1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:11,740
Hey, sorry, I just like accidentally slammed. Sorry for slamming. Hi. Hey, how are you?

2
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:19,399
You're late, I know. Yeah, I may have uh, I may have really, really overshot the hole. I'm gonna

3
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:26,600
fix my sleep schedule in 12 hours thing, but I got close. I got really close. You know I got close

4
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,600
because there's absolutely no way there'd be a stream at like 12 30 specific if I didn't get

5
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:44,259
close. So I got close. We're not starting, it's not four. Another reason why we're starting um,

6
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:52,899
three to four hours early and typically about the 4 p.m plus time period is because today is going

7
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:59,820
to be a double header. We're going to play Mario Golf for a little while to pretend that I don't

8
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:07,819
just play Elden Ring. It's a way for people to scroll by and see German985 currently live

9
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:14,620
playing Mario Golf. Okay, all right. He's cool. He's variety, right? Like it's, I don't, I mean,

10
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:22,140
I'm not going to click on that, but I know he's doing it. We're in EU. Is EU? Yeah, is that what

11
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:29,909
I mean? It's for people to understand that I don't just play Elden Ring and then we're going to play

12
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:35,590
Elden Ring. So this is just for the scrollers, the first like four or five hours of the stream.

13
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:43,049
I'm going to take a break, a real break, one that I don't, I don't think I've ever done on this channel.

14
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:50,500
I have never done what I'm going to do today. So I'm very, very, I'm very intrigued to see how this

15
00:01:50,500 --> 00:02:04,180
works. Somewhere in the next four or five hours, I'm going to put up the BRB screen with some text

16
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:13,960
on it saying that I'll be back in like 20 to 30 minutes. We're going to do a legit 20 minute break

17
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:22,729
halfway through here. We're going to come back somewhere around that, whatever that is,

18
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:35,460
and do Elden Ring for the rest of the night. Your views are going to plummet. I mean, yeah,

19
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:40,229
they are. Of course they are. But this will be a good, this is a nice little science experiment,

20
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:54,340
don't you think? I'm very curious how this works. Intermission Andy. Yeah. So we're going to do about

21
00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:00,020
four or five hours now and then four or five hours later, bringing us to an Omega time period

22
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:07,620
of about 10 hours or so today. Maybe less, maybe more, depending. I also have to get ready for the

23
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:13,800
streamer awards because I haven't even prepared at all. So this will be the last stream you see

24
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:20,469
on this channel for a little while. I will be at the streamer awards. You can watch it. I'm sure

25
00:03:20,469 --> 00:03:29,159
you'll be able to pick me out of the crowd at some point. I will be there. So as of today,

26
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:45,110
I will see you on this channel after today, next week. Oh, fucking Poggies. Yeah. Poggies. Poggies.

27
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:51,259
All right. I'm going to have no cam on because this is the first time in like three weeks that

28
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:57,020
I've been able to have no shirt on when I stream. So I'm going to, I'm doing that. I'll have a cam

29
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:01,180
on Elden Ring. When I take my break, I'll put a shirt on. So you're going to deal with no cam for

30
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,659
like, I don't know, however long I pretend to play Mario golf. Oh, also somebody bet me something in

31
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:12,060
chat. The person that said, Hey dude, play Mario golf is the same person that also said, if you

32
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:18,620
don't give this game at least a seven out of 10, ban me for a month. What I said is, I mean,

33
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:24,620
you're kind of already going up against some pretty intense odds considering that all the Mario sports

34
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:34,709
games are like five or sixes. I mean, like I think I'm going to give this a seven. I don't know if

35
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:41,220
you're going to get a seven out of this. That's a bad take. Well, at least in the last 10 years,

36
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,100
Mario Sonic and Olympic games, was that a six? What was it? Let's be real. Let's go. Come on.

37
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,779
Let's be honest. What, what would, what would you give a score to Mario and Sonic at the Olympic

38
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:58,779
games? What is it? Is it a six or a seven? It's a five, seven for nostalgia. Okay. But that doesn't

39
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:09,980
count. It'd be probably a six. It was a six for the Wii. Okay. All right. What's, what's the last

40
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:24,259
Mario sports game? Mario tennis for the Switch. That's like a six. That was like a 6.5. I'm seeing

41
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:30,180
a lot of sevens. I'm seeing a lot of sixes and sevens. So how is that a bad take when it's

42
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:38,819
everybody's take in the chat? Besides like, at least like, ow. No, you can't put stuff in the Wii.

43
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:43,220
You guys keep forgetting the Wii is more than, the Wii is like fucking 15 years old now.

44
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:50,889
I'm talking about like current gen and a little bit of last gen, like the last five to 10 years.

45
00:05:50,889 --> 00:06:02,740
You give me a Mario sports game that was like a nine. Not gonna happen. They're fun. They're not

46
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:16,139
bad games. What about Mario Strikers? Yeah, that game's fantastic. I'm looking forward to the next

47
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:21,579
one. That might, that actually might be the first like Mario sports game in five to 10 years.

48
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:29,269
That actually is like a nine for me. It could be. That game was absolutely unbelievable.

49
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:40,620
Mario Strikers charged. Honestly, I think my opinion just soured just based on

50
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:48,389
my Mario tennis. Like right now on my screen, I just see Mario with a tennis racket.

51
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:59,480
That's fucking infuriating me. That's a tennis racket and I'm pissed off about it.

52
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:05,480
Anytime Mario wears regular clothes, just like that aren't his overalls and his shirt,

53
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,879
like when he wears like just like pants, like suit pants, it pisses, I get mad because I know

54
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:18,379
it's either a tennis game or a golf game. I'm already mad. All right, maybe I should stop.

55
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:35,399
Jesus Christ. All right, what should I do? I don't want to like do all this. I want to like

56
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:44,860
play golf. I'm just gonna play golf. I know there's like an RPG mode in this game, right?

57
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:59,129
Do I really want to do that? I'll go do golf adventure. I'm not playing ranked. Golf adventure.

58
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:06,660
Okay, so I have to make a me. Is that how this works? There I am. I'm already made.

59
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:17,980
Dominant hand is set to right. Yeah, that's fine. How do you blonde hair? I don't know. I made it

60
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:45,850
in 10 seconds. The scan lines. Why the scan line? Oh, it's on TV. Hey, you turn it off at the worst

61
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:55,639
possible time. Erdo. Oh, it looked like Mario just won. Isn't that the end of the tourney?

62
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:02,759
Did you see how he won? That was ridiculous. I need to see a replay, some slow mo. Don't I

63
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:10,039
beat the shit out of these people on a daily basis? Why would they be? Why are they like fans of mine?

64
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:19,750
Okay. Oh, sorry, Chuck. But remember the welcome ceremony tomorrow is more important than watching

65
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:26,169
TV. He he he Berto is right. We should all get some good sleep tonight. I feel like we're going

66
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:30,919
to need it. Thank you. How wonderful to have at least one sensible rookie in the house.

67
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:35,539
Oh, these are players. Okay, I thought they were just like people watching.

68
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:42,490
I'll sleep just fine. What about you? I didn't even know ghosts could sleep. You don't just

69
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:48,740
fall through the bed. Chuck, I feel like that's a rude question to ask a ghost. Anyway, I guess

70
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,980
I'll go to bed too. I want to make a good impression at the welcome ceremony tomorrow.

71
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:00,299
That's a good idea, dear. I know you're hoping to be one of the standouts in this rookie class.

72
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:04,059
Gosh, you can't out drive me. Sorry, Toadette, but you're always going to be playing catch up

73
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:09,259
to the real heavy hitters. Ha ha ha. Excuse me. You can't always win with power alone. You know,

74
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:13,610
you've got to keep a level head and no one to lay up. Happy Gilmore would say otherwise.

75
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:20,100
You've got both in wrong. Finesse is the name of the game.

76
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:34,470
Who's this guy? Oh, it's me. It feels weird. I feel like I'm in a sims house. Right. Oh,

77
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:41,080
it's you. We've been waiting for you. Come join us, please. Everyone, please allow me to introduce

78
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:48,889
the final rookie in your group. Jeremy. Who's that? You're a rookie too? How much did you

79
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:56,009
over here? I mean, nice to meet you. It's the golf association called to let us know that one more

80
00:10:56,009 --> 00:11:01,610
rookie would be arriving late. Now they're here. All right. All right. So how far can you drive it,

81
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:07,049
Rook? You want to tee it up and see? Don't mind Chuck. He's got an oversized driver for a brain.

82
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:11,159
Come on, everyone. You'll be all learning together. You guys wanted me to play the fucking

83
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:18,059
RPG mode. It's gonna take like four hours to get started. I could have already driven the ball

84
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:25,799
400 yards by now. The name's charging Chuck. I hit the long ball. Boom. Don't matter where it goes.

85
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:31,669
As long as it goes far giddy up. I'm Toadette. It's great to meet another student of the game.

86
00:11:31,669 --> 00:11:38,809
I hope we can all learn from each other. I'm boo. Boo. He he. Edit any other characters that

87
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:43,129
every human on earth has seen more than a thousand times that we need introductions for.

88
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:48,250
I'm being really like rude to this game. All right. Yeah, I'm out of here. I got a lift anyway.

89
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:53,159
If you want to hit up the green, your biceps got to be mean. While I was on my way to bed,

90
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:57,080
the most important thing for strong muscles is recovery. Wait, we do like exercises?

91
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:02,070
I don't understand the obsession with muscles that seems to plague those of you with physical

92
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:10,730
bodies. Anyway, off to bed. He he he. It's quite a crew we have. What am I thinking? You must be

93
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:18,379
exhausted. Why don't you head to your room and get some rest? I'm Birdo, the camphouse mama.

94
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:25,909
You can even call me mama if you want. I wanted to go. Okay. Now your room is the one in the back.

95
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:39,259
We've got the we've got a big welcome ceremony tomorrow. Go get rest. R1, R1, R1, R1. Oh, this

96
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:48,620
is Charging Chuck's room. What's in there? I'm just going to bed. You know what? All right. I

97
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:53,379
got to be very honest with everybody here. Maybe incredibly honest. I don't care about any of this

98
00:12:53,379 --> 00:13:00,230
lore. I don't care at all. Zero. I don't want to knock on everybody's door and see what like what

99
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:06,299
they're doing. I don't I don't care. I just don't. I'm sorry. Does that make me like a bad person

100
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:13,820
for not caring about the storyline in Mario Golf? I just want to drive a ball hard. Meet

101
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:19,399
the manager in the front of the clubhouse. They're your friends? They're not my friends. I just moved

102
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:27,240
in. I just moved in five seconds ago. These people don't know who I am. I'm in Boo's room.

103
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:47,370
Let's Charging Chuck up too. You know what? I do I will commend companies like Nintendo and other

104
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:56,360
companies that have tried to make just hey let's play golf a better more interesting kind of fun

105
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:02,759
experience rather than just what you know just turning around at the tee and driving the ball

106
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:08,070
out of bounds like a thousand yards the wrong way and then literally turning the game off because

107
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:16,889
that's what I've done at every golf game I've ever played. Hope you're feeling rested. Did you get a

108
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:22,980
good night's sleep? I did. Oh good. I didn't wake you because you seemed like you really needed the

109
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:27,659
rest but now you're running late for the welcome ceremony. Head outside and straight down the road.

110
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:43,139
Hurry! Why is it pointing there? Okay wait. R1. R1. R1. Just one more thing. Everyone in town knows

111
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:48,980
that we have a new class of rookies starting out so you'll have a lot of eyes on you and expect some

112
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:57,100
pretty high expectations. Let's put your best foot forward. All right. I better not turn all the way

113
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:14,779
100 180 degrees in the wrong direction and drive. I shouldn't do that. Bonnie Greens. It's ugly.

114
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:27,720
This place is filled with talented rookies but let's pump the brakes a bit. Not everyone can be

115
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:33,899
a star on day one. Let's give these. What's wrong with this? Something's wrong. It's something

116
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:38,460
a bit like the aliasing. This is this is looks off. Why does it look so wrong? Is it like the

117
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:46,419
anti-aliasing? Dude the rookie everyone's talking about right? Bonnie Green says world-class

118
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:55,159
practicing courses. Okay. I honestly like I this is a difference than the other Nintendo games.

119
00:15:56,299 --> 00:16:06,730
Usually the aliasing doesn't look this bad. Nice to meet you. I'm the head coach. All right. Let's

120
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:16,549
do the ceremony. A 3090. I'm not I'm on a switch right now dude. Come on. Okay. Everyone's here

121
00:16:16,549 --> 00:16:25,460
coach. Welcome rookies. Clearly all you know the story history but a minor never hurts. Bonnie

122
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:34,179
Green's golf village is the birthplace of countless legendary golfers. Yeah. Hope you all realize how

123
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:40,570
lucky you are to get a chance to write your own chapter in the Bonnie Green story. I'm the clubhouse

124
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:45,450
manager here and it's my pleasure to welcome you to this rookie class. Now you just met our head

125
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:49,860
coach. He has a lot to offer so I hope you all take his lessons. After all he's launched the careers of

126
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:58,090
several top players. Hey thanks for that. Now you're all here for a reason. You've got the raw

127
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:02,330
talent to make it in life. That doesn't mean it can be easy. I'll help you make sure you make it all.

128
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:11,160
Very well then I'll go ahead and pass these out. This is a golf watch. Rookies it'll track your

129
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:18,200
stats, record your scores, and a whole lot more. Come on get one. George and Chuck. That's me with

130
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:23,539
my watch. I hear you drive the ball a little bit. Let's see if we can't teach you some control. I

131
00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:29,269
feel like I'm an AI reading this. Control? That gonna help me hit it farther? I want to play as

132
00:17:29,269 --> 00:17:42,460
that guy. Just smash the A button. I don't care. I don't care about these guys getting their watches.

133
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:51,319
I just want my watch. I hear you're a real prodigy but rough around the edges. Just like the fairway

134
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:58,650
I guess. Just made that up. All right that's enough for intros. Go ahead and slap those new golf

135
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:04,970
watches on your wrists. Can I get the golf watch on? Your data is already in there. Like magic,

136
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:11,180
just press on and make sure it looks right. The first screen that comes up should be pretty basic.

137
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:15,420
It shows the different aliens you can turn into. This one's a small alien and can get in small

138
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:19,740
places and has a high pitched voice. This one is a big strong alien but sometimes it's hard to tell

139
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:25,589
which one you're going to get. Just smash it and just be a good tv show. Don't worry about all the

140
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:31,690
advanced functions right now okay. Now I'm going to go over the badge system. No no badge system.

141
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:37,849
Okay this is actually kind of cool. You see where it says steel badge? One day when you reach the

142
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:46,230
top it might say platinum instead. Okay I can go 160 yards. All right so you play tournaments,

143
00:18:46,230 --> 00:19:00,380
this training, this is leveling up. Yeah that's cool. New member of the team. It's Toad. Hey

144
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:06,059
everyone I'm Toad. I've been looking forward to this for quite a long time. Golf is more popular

145
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:12,460
than ever in the Mushroom Kingdom. Wasn't that tourney yesterday incredible? But if we want to

146
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:19,109
keep the sport interesting we need some green players you see. And I just don't need folks who

147
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:24,950
can hit the green. Oh whoa wait. This is crazy. That's all I had to do was like just clear my

148
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:29,349
throat. We need some fresh faces on the leaderboards. That's where you all come in. We've scouted each

149
00:19:29,349 --> 00:19:41,210
of you for your special talents. Maybe you're a big star. That wasn't even a bad impression.

150
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:56,660
You know how bad all Toad impressions are? Never mind. Who's my caddy? Have you guys noticed

151
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:01,750
that all the Mario characters have gotten regular voices except for that guy?

152
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:10,470
All the Mario characters are like whoa hey. And now but this guy's still

153
00:20:13,609 --> 00:20:29,940
they've never changed it. It's always been that. Oh nice. All right time to play.

154
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,750
I went up the golf watch. I don't need the golf watch. All right let's go meet the caddy.

155
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:47,670
Hi yes I'm Jeremy. I've been waiting for you. All right so you're my caddy so just tell me what

156
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:54,059
clubs to use. Okay I'm here for the package. Yes you don't have any idea what I'm talking about

157
00:20:54,059 --> 00:21:03,079
do you? I'm here to give you your first set of clubs. They're already customized perfectly. Okay

158
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:06,839
now when you're playing around here you'll be chasing after your ball and your own two legs

159
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:11,059
no carts. I did see that from the trailer. That's probably going to be the fun part of the game.

160
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:21,880
We won't load you up with a full set of 14 clubs. I only need three. I never understood all the

161
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:27,259
multiple clubs thing in golf. Give me the driver, the putter, and the pitching wedge. That's all I

162
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:33,460
need. That's all you're going to see me play with. All right that's enough for me. Go ahead and strap

163
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:45,740
on the bag. You got a set of golf clubs. Okay cool. All right I want I need a huge driver.

164
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:56,759
Do you guys remember the commercials? Those big huge like titanium rod in the middle drivers.

165
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:02,099
They were it was an infomercial for them all the time and that shit was illegal to play within

166
00:22:02,099 --> 00:22:10,950
tournaments. As the driver master 400 El Diablo driver or something right? And these things they

167
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:14,950
were you couldn't use them in tournaments. You couldn't use them like and play with them in a

168
00:22:15,509 --> 00:22:23,400
actual setting. The thing was like it was almost a foot long and it had this huge piece of titanium

169
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:28,150
in the middle and it was like guaranteed to like it was like a corked bat. I used to see that

170
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:33,299
commercial all the fucking time. You physically couldn't even play with it unless you like were

171
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:44,779
just driving with like you know the funny somebody dickhead friends in the driving range. Satan

172
00:22:44,779 --> 00:22:51,720
driver. I swear to god it was something like that. All right so I'm just gonna go this way.

173
00:22:51,720 --> 00:23:11,740
Take some lessons. All right here we go. I'm ready. Let's go. You want to review the basics

174
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:16,900
of hitting a shot. I mean I kind of need to know what I'm doing. All right that aims. That aims.

175
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:24,039
Yep yep yep. That shows the overhead view. Very cool. The inner circle shows where the ball will

176
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:33,299
Okay and then the translucent outside border shows where it will roll. Okay some of the shots carry

177
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:37,930
and run equals its total distance. Distance is also affected by shot power wind speed and direction

178
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:48,420
and elevation changes. Okay there's a gauge. Press it. Bing bing. There it is. Okay by the way you'll

179
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:53,930
need 60 points to pass this lesson. All right I got it. I got it. This is gonna be easy. Easy.

180
00:23:53,930 --> 00:24:03,400
It's simple. Let's go. I got a pro controller in my hand right now. All right you want to get

181
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:10,700
precise. The blue section of the target will score you the most points. Okay of course that

182
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:15,180
isn't always the best spot to be. That will depend on where the wind is. Okay. Aim for the blue area.

183
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:25,589
Okay cool. Let's take a look. There it is. So that's 160 yards. We're gonna go right here.

184
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:51,240
What was wrong with that? All right 10 points. I did it. Okay nice. Yeah I want it to roll. I don't

185
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:57,500
want to do it. You know if it's 160 yards away you don't hit the ball 160 yards. Well that was

186
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:09,269
bullshit. That was actually bullshit. Why have you not turned around yet? Because this is the

187
00:25:09,269 --> 00:25:17,460
fucking practice area dude. I'm not gonna do that in the practice zone. I'm not gonna turn around.

188
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:35,930
The point is to hit it exactly 160 yards. The point is to get it into the 10. That's not gonna

189
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:50,660
be enough. I'm undershooting it a little. How did that feel? Were you able to hit the shots where

190
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:56,599
you wanted? Yeah. Next we'll hit five more shots but now we're going to get more aggressive and

191
00:25:56,599 --> 00:26:03,779
set up for a birdie. Okay let's get more aggressive. All right sure. So I need to

192
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:21,960
smash this as hard as I can. Are you playing the golf tutorial? I was gonna jump into golf

193
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:28,789
but people said do the adventure mode because they wanted to hear a toad yell at them for

194
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:47,910
fucking an hour. All right that was good. I can shape the shot too. This is fast forward.

195
00:26:47,910 --> 00:27:07,460
Oh there is. Okay yeah let's go. How can I shape? Let's see. Oh you can curve it. Oh shit. I can't

196
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:19,900
wait to try to curve a ball around the entire forest. All right that's 60 points. Nice. Do I

197
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:36,940
level up? Okay power has leveled up. Cool. Oh yeah yeah yeah I wanted to be power. Well you crushed

198
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:40,519
it. You got to play it safe too. Not to take anything away from this performance but you've

199
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:45,079
always got to improve. Good job Jeremy. Keep improving the accuracy of your shots and you

200
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:58,279
need to pay attention to both carry and run. I don't care. Take some lessons. From who? Power

201
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:05,769
only. That's what I'm doing. I'm going to put every single point into distance and just have

202
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:17,339
the giant infomercial driver. That's illegal and I'm just gonna win every tournament. 30 yard

203
00:28:17,339 --> 00:28:25,500
approach. A flat ground using your wedge. Okay. Get the ball into the green. I know how it works.

204
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:45,099
Me strong. All right I got my pitching wedge so you want to pretty much just pitch it on there.

205
00:28:46,059 --> 00:29:06,069
Almost a hole in one. Nice. Yeah this is simple. We need a me strong golf swing.

206
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:28,299
Nice. All right approach shots are key to scoring well. We're on pretty level ground it seems. Okay

207
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:40,470
with 30 yards of elevation to gain at count four. Got to carry a little farther. No I just get the

208
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:53,269
ball into the hole. That's all I need to know. Nothing else matters. Just get it in. Don't tell

209
00:29:53,269 --> 00:30:16,839
me well you see this elevation in it. No just put ball into hole. All right. Nice.

210
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:33,660
Why are you still here? All right we're uphill now. Hole is one yard downhill and 98 feet away.

211
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:46,460
Okay all right all right all right get out of my way. Easy. Right in. That was good. That was good.

212
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:57,670
He's gonna say okay every time. Okay that's the streamer curse. Don't you

213
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:02,390
understand? That's the- I don't want more than three or four seconds to go by without any sound

214
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:12,279
effects. Think about that. Five seconds of no talking is like it's like streamer dog years.

215
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:15,480
It's like it might as well be 30 minutes. It's like five straight minutes.

216
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:38,099
Fuck. Okay you want to do the- all right I'll do- I gotta just do the- let me just do this.

217
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:52,890
Well the goal is to get the ball into the thing. Kitboga! Kitboga! Coming in for a raid.

218
00:31:53,450 --> 00:32:05,079
What's up Kit? Welcome everybody. We're currently playing Mario Golf. Uh it's- this is just breaking

219
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:13,380
it up a little bit because I'm going to play an Elden Ring later but thanks Kit. Hope you had a

220
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:25,130
good stream. Hope it was eventful. More Elden Ring? That's a nerd game. Well just watch this

221
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:35,750
stream then. This is gonna be two today. Just playing this as the meme. No actually this is-

222
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:40,150
I'm genuinely- when I saw the trailer for this I genuinely thought it was uh interesting looking.

223
00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:50,329
All right so I gotta be careful. So this is- we're going up. I gotta hit it a little bit harder. Just

224
00:32:50,329 --> 00:33:11,589
a little bit. Not very much. Okay. Okay. So this is not just gonna be golf. This is gonna be um

225
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:19,049
what are those? What are those guys called? The Stompers? What are they called? They're gonna be

226
00:33:19,049 --> 00:33:30,170
all over the green and stuff right? This one's downhill all the way. All right but that was not

227
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:49,690
enough at all. That's fine. Nice on. Derma hates video games. I don't hate video games.

228
00:33:50,329 --> 00:34:04,339
This is to change it up a little. All right. Ride the rookie course. Let's go. It's time to go.

229
00:34:04,339 --> 00:34:08,619
Let's go for it. All right was- was the person said if this- if you don't think this game is

230
00:34:08,619 --> 00:34:14,039
at least a seven out of ten then you should ban me for a month? Um you're about to find out if I

231
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:29,269
actually like this game. Okay this is the rookie course. This is cute though. It actually is cute.

232
00:34:29,269 --> 00:34:43,500
I actually like this. I don't know how a shift can affect- no. Oh fuck off. Stop calling me. Three

233
00:34:43,500 --> 00:35:00,760
holes. Finishing five over par or better to pass. That's a pass? It's like a super bogey. All right

234
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:06,119
11 mile per hour wind downhill downhill slope 7.3 yards. We don't care about any of those. We're

235
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:31,260
just gonna drive over them. All right. I think I got a pretty good idea. Yeah it's funny. He did

236
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:53,690
the funny thing right? I love somebody in the chat just wrote. Oh my god he's so funny. That

237
00:35:53,690 --> 00:36:09,179
was not bad. All right now how far here? 120 yards downhill? The driver. Can I use the driver on the

238
00:36:09,179 --> 00:36:25,460
green? If you can that's really funny. Yeah you can. Can you fucking imagine somebody doing this?

239
00:36:33,829 --> 00:36:41,590
All right that's- I got one more stroke and I'm good. I got it.

240
00:36:43,429 --> 00:37:05,320
Oh no. I think I can get this in one go. Ready? No not quite. I'm gonna go this way though.

241
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:17,320
Play seriously. I'm gonna- I'm doing it right now. He's gonna fail the rookie course. I'm not gonna

242
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:26,969
fail the rookie course. Watch. I can hit the tree. I feel like that's gonna hit the tree.

243
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:42,300
Find out. That's too far. Way too far. Way too far. I thought I was gonna go through the leaves and

244
00:37:42,300 --> 00:38:05,380
get all fucked up. All right I- I gotta chip this real lightly here. It's not bad. Fuck you.

245
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:16,710
I'm at plus four? Oh shit. Okay I can't be plus five so I actually have to do- okay no fucking

246
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:28,840
around. I actually have to do this well. This is perfect for me. It's 143 yards. I gotta go

247
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:46,679
like kind of somewhere like here. Like right here. Get on the green. Oh fuck off. All right this is

248
00:38:46,679 --> 00:39:16,230
uphill. This'll do it. Right in. Yes! I'm good. Nice. Plus three. Level up twice? Ooh. I want to

249
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:30,940
get that to at least 200 yards or 180. That was just kind of fun. Three holes in a time limit

250
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:35,260
and score well too. You have 10 minutes to finish par three, par four, and a par five.

251
00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:47,980
It's called speed golf. Speed golf? Well you have to- I have to run around now. All right how does

252
00:39:47,980 --> 00:40:09,829
this work? Huh? Dash? You can push people out of the way. There's a special dash. This seems kind

253
00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:26,420
of chaotic. Okay so this is a time limit. Finish three holes at plus three or better in 10 minutes

254
00:40:26,420 --> 00:41:04,630
or less. So I'm actually playing against other players? Oh fuck I have to run. Okay. All right

255
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:13,909
birdie putt. What does it look like? All right so this is um blue means it's going up and the red

256
00:41:13,909 --> 00:41:23,860
means it's going down. Right? What do we got for wind? Wind is down a lot. Okay I'm just gonna-

257
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:34,699
I think it was too hard. Oh we got it. I mean he got it. I did it. I did it. He got it. I got it.

258
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:50,570
Okay cool. Oh shit. All right we're gonna go- I'm going this way. Is that stupid? Yeah it is pretty

259
00:41:50,570 --> 00:42:07,320
stupid. Let's drive it as far as I can. What's the problem? We only have eight and a half minutes.

260
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:21,300
That's so funny that you can actually punch people and push people. Go faster?

261
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:30,219
Like this is as fast as the character can move. All right 148. We're gonna go- this is curving

262
00:42:30,219 --> 00:42:39,449
a little. Where's the wind? All right wind's not bad. Let's go. It's gonna be on the green.

263
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:57,110
Green? Tell me. Green. Fringe. What's fringe mean? Oh right at the end. Right at the lip.

264
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:08,789
All right wind's coming down to the left a little. So it's a hundred foot. We're going

265
00:43:08,789 --> 00:43:13,190
probably like 30 feet. We're going up. I'm gonna go tighten it up a little bit this way. We're gonna

266
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:34,550
go for it. All right. Fringe. Cringe. Oh come on. What the fuck? What happened? Wait what?

267
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:53,670
I have no idea what just happened. All right well I got it. Whatever. We're going here and I'm gonna

268
00:43:53,670 --> 00:44:14,710
go over the sand trap. You can't get a golf cart. I mean this is kind of cool but isn't this the

269
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:28,059
exact reason why people play golf video games? Because this is the worst part of golf. Actually

270
00:44:28,059 --> 00:44:34,949
needing to go to get the ball is like the- is the worst part of the whole sport. All right so the

271
00:44:34,949 --> 00:44:39,110
wind is going cutting this way a little bit. We're gonna drive it over here. That should give us a

272
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:49,750
little bit of leeway I think. It's more fun with people. That makes sense. That makes sense.

273
00:44:50,469 --> 00:44:58,360
Although is it though? I kind of feel like after you push your friend for the first time

274
00:44:59,159 --> 00:45:04,659
and then you all laugh eventually you all just start to be like so can we like skip this part?

275
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:10,900
It gets to a part where everybody holds down start and it's like oh player four wants to skip

276
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:19,380
and everyone else just presses start. It's like yeah yeah yeah. All right so I want to go like

277
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:38,250
here. That was way too far. What was it? Oh that was a good approach. All right this is a birdie putt.

278
00:45:38,250 --> 00:46:00,440
Don't fuck it up. Don't look at wind for putt. Stop acting like you know anything about golf.

279
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:15,420
Guys I went to golf camp one day and I left. That's a real story. In fact I would think that

280
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:27,429
some of you did the same thing. How many of you guys went to golf camp for like a day or two and

281
00:46:27,429 --> 00:46:32,920
then we're like eh never mind this isn't for me. I kind of feel like that's happened to more than

282
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:45,480
a few of us. It may have been like uh uh maybe I don't know you know when like your kids are

283
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:49,639
getting to the age where they're old enough to like hold a baseball bat or like hold a golf club

284
00:46:50,199 --> 00:46:57,670
and it's like oh maybe hey hey son what do you think about golf um I don't know well we'll get

285
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:02,230
you into golf camp and see how it works let's see how it is for you hey hop we'll get you to baseball

286
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:13,619
camp and then it's like oh that sounds kind of fun oh it does it sounds fun doesn't it young son

287
00:47:13,619 --> 00:47:18,710
of course it does that kind of sounds fun I hit the ball with the thing yeah you hit the ball

288
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:39,019
the thing oh my boys are gonna grow up and we're gonna be on the back nine together sorry dad yeah

289
00:47:39,019 --> 00:47:44,699
well yeah yeah yeah it's not I didn't go like to a camp where I like slept over or something for

290
00:47:44,699 --> 00:47:52,150
like a summer it's not like oh yeah I went to I went to camp and it was like it was like a four

291
00:47:52,150 --> 00:48:08,869
week golf camp where I stayed over somewhere no can I go over here it sounds like a crappy 90s

292
00:48:08,869 --> 00:48:22,150
movie let's go qualifying round it'll be golfing with two other players and there's a time limit

293
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:42,469
wait am I actually playing with people I'm gonna play all nine holes okay oh shit all right I'm

294
00:48:42,469 --> 00:48:53,590
ready it finished we're doing nine holes that's so long you know how I would actually enjoy golf

295
00:48:56,219 --> 00:49:02,539
if an entire game wasn't 18 holes people complain about how long it takes to play a game of baseball

296
00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:09,820
playing an entire 18 nine holes whatever golf takes like an entire it takes like two days

297
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:31,719
oh shit oh how do I punch I'm going for Tony's the weakest come here why am I so slower

298
00:49:36,949 --> 00:49:42,940
and I like stand in front of it wait this is actually really dangerous uh Yoshi don't swing

299
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:51,380
Jesus oh my god that doesn't teach kids anything good that's teaching kids terrible golf etiquette

300
00:49:51,380 --> 00:50:19,860
what these hearts what are the hearts for where's my ball over here we only have a minute to do this

301
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:39,289
oh I'm gonna drain this check this out oh get out of the way you're breathing on me all right

302
00:50:39,289 --> 00:50:54,539
pink Yoshi fucked up big time cool all right that was fun ready you gotta be the first to drive

303
00:50:55,099 --> 00:51:19,380
170 yards perfect hold on are they with his animals get away from me oh I needed that

304
00:51:28,699 --> 00:51:37,429
can I block it holy shit told you awfully okay how far is it it's a 30 feet

305
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:41,590
this we're a little bit up the hill here we're gonna curve it I'm gonna smash it this way let's

306
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:53,849
go it's in that's in that's in that's in get out of the way what that's all right I did better

307
00:51:53,849 --> 00:52:18,409
than them that's a bad idea oh I thought I could just clothesline both of them right there

308
00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:38,300
what are the coins for wait did I just drift what was that okay they're not even close to

309
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:46,869
as powerful as I am they're not even close to as powerful as I am oh you guys are going that way

310
00:52:46,869 --> 00:53:05,539
huh oh actually yeah good idea you need to attack them kill them I can't hurt them still better

311
00:53:05,539 --> 00:53:17,219
you can exchange the coins does speed even matter I don't know I don't why do I have to

312
00:53:17,219 --> 00:53:32,619
go so fast I have a minute that's not a ton of time but 130 yards through the tree that's good

313
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:53,340
all right I'm gonna probably chip this in we got this 33 yards going okay then they curve in there

314
00:53:53,340 --> 00:54:05,420
come on all right how's this looking I got a minute and a half to do this all right I want to go like

315
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:12,869
here it's a little hard but I think it'll go yep nice you need to grab him by the neck

316
00:54:17,289 --> 00:54:23,690
be running sprinting behind him grab the caddy of clubs and just pull it as hard as you can so

317
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:34,500
they go down imagine they added like a melee attack with just a golf club just left right left

318
00:54:34,579 --> 00:55:25,239
right left right swinging want the coins come on go oh yeah Gabby J

319
00:55:32,679 --> 00:55:48,699
did I just knock his ball away wait I think I just did holy shit he almost got it in

320
00:55:49,699 --> 00:56:00,579
this is going downhill right oh what is Yoshi taking a shit in the hole what was that

321
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:19,289
Yoshi was just squatting down in front of the hole come on Toad you can do it it's so depressing

322
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:38,139
depressing okay no I can't for the joke I can't I'm like I'm in the lead right now leave me alone

323
00:56:52,260 --> 00:57:02,179
stop no I wanted that okay do you know how this would actually be fun if it was like

324
00:57:02,179 --> 00:57:19,510
50 person multiplayer and you could there was collision on all balls I should have

325
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:35,460
picked up the driver it's eight that's still kind of a lot yeah I'm drifting behind Toad

326
00:57:36,099 --> 00:57:41,480
that's why that just happened all right this is gonna be a difficult approach here we go

327
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:47,159
we're we're we're on an incline I gotta tilt it a little bit this way and I'm gonna curve it a

328
00:57:47,159 --> 00:57:57,269
little bit that way that's in the hole that's in the fucking hole oh my god it's not in the

329
00:57:57,269 --> 00:58:23,800
hole it was almost in the hole oh no Toad Toad just looks like a little kid don't worry Toad

330
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:37,099
you're only in the last place I'm in the lead let's get to keep it up mom said you have to

331
00:58:37,099 --> 00:58:43,369
bring Toad all right where's the wind wind is going nime up I'm not let these idiots

332
00:58:43,369 --> 00:58:48,730
fucking swing immediately I'm gonna hold them on okay so wind is going that way I'm gonna drive

333
00:58:48,730 --> 00:59:02,389
it into the wind a little bit like this way it's not too much women it's enough here we go that's

334
00:59:02,389 --> 00:59:19,099
going in thank you oh fuck I gotta run I'm on the green these guys have a full stroke if I sink this

335
00:59:19,099 --> 00:59:28,179
putt I win the game this is this is to solidify the game putt this is one of those putts where

336
00:59:28,179 --> 00:59:37,610
the guy walks around for 40 minutes all right so this is uphill okay it's we're going this way

337
00:59:38,489 --> 00:59:50,659
it's hard to tell where the hill is okay how strong is that pole going this way I wonder

338
00:59:51,380 --> 01:00:10,489
this is 100 feet I think this is good let's try it oh more it was more even more to the right

339
01:00:21,579 --> 01:00:29,449
out they had way more strokes I'm just slowly chipping away Toad wants to play angry birds on

340
01:00:29,449 --> 01:00:36,579
your iPad make sure it doesn't get the screen all sticky again I will tell you that was one of the

341
01:00:36,579 --> 01:00:44,309
most that was one of the worst things ever because of being an uncle right I have lots of nieces and

342
01:00:44,309 --> 01:00:53,820
nephews and anytime it's like oh like can I play with your phone no you're gonna touch it

343
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:58,460
and you're gonna like touch it and put your fingers all over it and like you're gonna open

344
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:05,750
up like an app I haven't opened in like a year you're going to apple up you're gonna open up

346
01:01:12,389 --> 01:01:32,980

347
01:01:33,619 --> 01:02:03,019
bunker I got hit into a bunker still closer than they are oh shit um nice get out of the way

348
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:15,210

349
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:31,130
person wait hates kids has an iphone and plays golf this one's kind of scary I have a huge

350
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:48,179
advantage here because this is just straight drives forward oh you don't like it that I'm

351
01:02:48,179 --> 01:03:06,699
drifting over there yeah it's mine where's my ball oh there's right there oh I want the driver

355
01:03:45,059 --> 01:04:05,289
oh be careful toad it's a tricky course it didn't lick your finger and hold it up

356
01:04:05,289 --> 01:04:17,820
all right now I'm really ahead okay drive drive I don't want to put take the three wood out

357
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:34,119
why does he hate toad so much I mean don't blame me why are you blaming me for this blame nintendo

358
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:41,159
putting him in last place in every game if he's an ai controlled character I didn't do that

359
01:04:41,800 --> 01:05:08,039
we're gonna go dry give me the driving wedge there it is bang oh let that go it's all right

360
01:05:08,039 --> 01:05:16,579
I'm in a good position to drive it over the lake all right I gotta this is gonna slice isn't it

361
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:30,699
oh shit it's gonna slice oh fuck that's really slicing where's it going where is it is it on

362
01:05:30,699 --> 01:05:44,900
green can I go in this what happened is that a stroke oh you dick I'm gonna remember that

363
01:05:45,619 --> 01:05:57,349
all right we see I'm gonna go they're plus three already these guys how are you plus three already

364
01:05:58,070 --> 01:06:24,949
it's still like how many holes left dipping it again what's happened I just hit his ball in

365
01:06:27,639 --> 01:06:52,900
green is wet oh level up level up level up level up I did it great work and just in time

366
01:06:57,940 --> 01:07:02,019
bonnie greens open tees off tomorrow and after that result you're all eligible to enter

367
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:09,179
now it's a two-day tourney the first day is an elimination round if you're still in the next day

368
01:07:09,179 --> 01:07:17,480
you'll have a chance to earn a chrome badge but only if you finish in the top three oh yeah this

369
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:22,900
one's in the bag just hand the trophy over well it may not hit shots like chuck but I'm confident in

370
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:31,670
my strategy old words but you're both looking past me as if I'm not even here I suppose I'm a

371
01:07:31,670 --> 01:07:45,860
ghost yeah this is only four players four player tournament I'm gonna laugh if I'm more powerful

372
01:07:45,860 --> 01:08:01,639
than um charging chuck whatever his name is if this won a chance you might be in for a surprise

373
01:08:01,639 --> 01:08:06,280
tomorrow and besides who says you're the favorites I heard some top players might be making an

374
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:20,920
appearance like uh potentially super mario super mario could be there okay uh hammer brother I

375
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:28,699
have a question why are you allowing smurfs mario and luigi being allowed in this tournament is

376
01:08:28,699 --> 01:08:40,550
not fair okay let's go we do things differently here the higher your rank the fewer clubs you

377
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:46,939
can carry trust me it works out I only need one club but that sounds tough for folks who don't

378
01:08:46,939 --> 01:09:17,020
crush the driver like I do we you and me are gonna get along everybody go to bed a lot of

379
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:22,500
townspeople to talk to but I'm not going to talk to any of them you know that jump that I had in

380
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:40,060
the game they took it from me no no no no I don't want to leave me alone this is a cute little town

381
01:09:40,699 --> 01:09:59,020
it's golf camp there's sprint mario slaughters these people this is like isn't this kind of

382
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:09,529
weird like oh we're at the fun golf camp golf town with all the koopas and goombas and like mario

383
01:10:09,529 --> 01:10:24,939
kills these people on a regular basis all the time mario's just an actor they all just actors

384
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:40,260
movies and tv shows aren't real what he's playing he's an actor he's playing golf with other actors

385
01:10:40,819 --> 01:10:52,020
they're actors in the story are they actually actors wait what how have I not known this

386
01:10:52,659 --> 01:11:03,689
the world of super mario is actors pretending to play fight each other they do that in mario 3

387
01:11:06,630 --> 01:11:11,579
but I mean that's mario 3 was one game is that how it's supposed to be the whole

388
01:11:11,579 --> 01:11:31,930
entire franchise that's why there are curtains in the beginning of three

389
01:11:32,729 --> 01:11:57,619
platforms in three are props I mean I understand that one game can be but is it like mario odyssey

390
01:11:57,619 --> 01:12:08,300
for instance is all just supposed to be like a movie like they're actors it's just in one game

391
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:29,750
yeah it's like the truman show mario doesn't know that would be really weird what a shot from

392
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:33,510
koopa troopa I think we're in for some great scores today with the way the course is playing

393
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:42,420
wait a minute the key to following mario around with the camera makes a hell of a lot more sense

394
01:12:42,420 --> 01:13:00,260
now he's just filming him for the fucking tv show what it's kind of ruining everything

395
01:13:04,789 --> 01:13:26,619
all right here we go hole one drive the ball 200 yards every time how did you get that special

396
01:13:26,619 --> 01:13:49,720
move oh yeah how is toad announcing and playing all right 166 this is uphill we're gonna have to

397
01:13:49,720 --> 01:14:06,600
go wind is a little bit rough this way here we go it's on the green now you gotta hit it one more

398
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:21,430
time I don't this is a different toad you asshole are okay everybody shut up for a second because

399
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:29,369
this is gonna be hard this one goes downhill then uphill and it looks like it's pulling this way

400
01:14:30,890 --> 01:14:43,180
tad so I gotta hit it actually pretty hard we're gonna hit it hard that's in that's in that's in

401
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:57,510
that's in that's in that's in that's in that's in oh fuck it oh come on are you serious that

402
01:14:57,510 --> 01:15:07,510
would have been awesome and I was curbed in you address the scandal well because I said that I

403
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:11,350
thought toad was playing uh look I wasn't paying attention I just see him with a headset on

404
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:39,510
holy shit wait a minute that might go in what what happened oh no no okay okay it rolled it

405
01:15:39,510 --> 01:15:50,180
rolled all right I gotta drain this I actually have to sink this slightly there's a little bit

406
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:57,670
of give here not very much but there is 15 feet away there's a little bit of give not that much

407
01:16:02,739 --> 01:16:14,359
oh there's more there was more give that was blue it wasn't blue though it's all right I'm

408
01:16:14,359 --> 01:16:22,470
still in third place but the top of that toad had like a blue hat on and the toad announcing had a

409
01:16:22,470 --> 01:16:29,909
blue hat on okay well not in the ass of he's gonna suit on but you know but he had a fucking

410
01:16:29,909 --> 01:16:52,020
blue hat on I swear to god what is that bullshit he's doing working two jobs to support his one

411
01:16:52,020 --> 01:17:21,960
million kids why are you implying that toads kind of just dump eggs out somewhere don't be

412
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:26,119
mad at me because I thought that was the same toad be mad at the guy that said toads lay a million

413
01:17:26,119 --> 01:17:31,159
eggs all right that's I'm the guy you're coming after that's me you're coming after why why are

414
01:17:31,159 --> 01:17:50,310
you coming after me all right 109 you said that though what I didn't say I was talking about what

415
01:17:50,310 --> 01:18:11,029
that guy said a million kids it's from it's spores well how do you get to a million kids

416
01:18:11,029 --> 01:18:16,390
if you're not laying like fucking 10,000 eggs every spring or whatever the fuck happens in

417
01:18:16,390 --> 01:18:23,750
like the world like the animal kingdom I'm not saying toads an animal I'm just saying I'm just

418
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:30,300
saying like you how do you have a million kids he needs to support his million kids that's like

419
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:47,829
you're dropping 50,000 eggs every spring mushrooms are fungi ready how how fast does fungi spread a

420
01:18:47,829 --> 01:19:26,739
year you don't understand toad fucks I wasn't looking I wasn't looking I heard a golf swing

421
01:19:26,739 --> 01:19:39,270
and then I heard my character go oh all right where's the wind this way you guys are fucking

422
01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:51,380
crazy everyone's calling me crazy when I'm simply reacting to the person that said that toad has a

423
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:58,739
million kids and I'm asking I was just simply asking how that would be possible even if he

424
01:19:58,739 --> 01:20:07,689
was a mushroom all right this is heavy heavy heavy I gotta go this way hard is this too much

425
01:20:08,409 --> 01:20:33,819
this is very heavy downhill right fuck you that was the one two I'm sorry I'm in second

426
01:20:40,819 --> 01:20:46,729
toad spreads his spores in a forest and that's where the babies come from okay so he lays eggs

427
01:20:46,729 --> 01:21:16,859
in the forest I got it okay got it like really my stomach hurts the amount of people right now that

428
01:21:16,859 --> 01:21:21,739
are freaking out about me talking about toad laying eggs is like it's killing me right now

429
01:21:25,109 --> 01:21:43,590
all right way too far imagine fighting with somebody over them saying that toad lays eggs

430
01:21:46,550 --> 01:21:57,130
oh this whole conversation is fucking hilarious to me you I know I am I know it's fucking funny

431
01:21:57,689 --> 01:22:24,739
this is gonna curve there it is oh get in come on I'm just imagining two people

432
01:22:25,699 --> 01:22:28,949
sitting on a couch passing a blunt back and forth

433
01:22:30,699 --> 01:22:37,829
oh but I don't know I don't understand man how is it possible he has to lay eggs no I know he it's

434
01:22:37,829 --> 01:22:44,949
spores it he goes to the forest and squats down and spores come out of his ass I don't know man

435
01:22:44,949 --> 01:22:50,069
I don't know how how much spore juice does he have in his in his glands that's too much I think it's

436
01:22:50,069 --> 01:23:08,100
eggs you're saying this is not the idiocy of the conversation we're having all right 166

437
01:23:10,199 --> 01:23:13,880
gonna go right here that's a good on right there actually gonna be good

438
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:32,170
while eating taco bell at 2 a.m. all right this is a good opportunity to get first place

439
01:23:32,170 --> 01:23:40,149
I have to get this putt though all right what we got 50 foot putt

440
01:23:41,289 --> 01:23:55,180
lots of pull this way I'm going here I think it's even more than that I think it's right here drain

441
01:23:55,180 --> 01:24:14,949
it drain it oh it's close minus one all right I have to do well here I can't let charge and chuck

442
01:24:14,949 --> 01:24:34,119
win a short game moron that was actually pretty good that's elder to your special

443
01:24:35,079 --> 01:24:47,130
I think my specials just run I don't have one yet that's hope is that chuck fucks it up yeah how

444
01:24:47,130 --> 01:25:01,739
come um what I'm not with chuck right now I'm not on his uh squad whatever this is this is going

445
01:25:01,739 --> 01:25:12,060
right to the green what's the wind like we're gonna cut it this way a little bit and go I think that's

446
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:24,149
good that looks real good actually that's gonna be close how close though enough to

447
01:25:24,149 --> 01:25:38,329
sink this oh yeah this is doable so I always have so much trouble in these golf games on

448
01:25:38,329 --> 01:25:48,039
how much this actually means that's steep I think right here I think right here wind is pushing it

449
01:25:48,039 --> 01:26:03,369
this way though how much does the wind really affect putt when it's downhill like this wind

450
01:26:03,369 --> 01:26:11,380
does affect putt it's because it's gonna pull me this way then levels out a little I'm thinking

451
01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:26,579
right here I'm going for it there it is all right we're in first place I had for first with chuck

452
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:39,880
not bad watch out for that tree I don't want to hit that tree

453
01:26:40,520 --> 01:27:00,819
you're gonna play call of duty four no no I'm not playing call of duty four

454
01:27:07,909 --> 01:27:17,739
get out of the way all right this is where's the wind it's gonna I gotta oh I have to overshoot

455
01:27:17,739 --> 01:27:44,060
this a little bit because the wind I'm gonna be on the green good spot right yeah all right this

456
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:52,520
is this is flat so I should nice putt all right this is literally just flat there's nothing here

457
01:27:52,520 --> 01:28:06,220
it's literally just straight 15 feet right to the hole this is it got it there's no way that he got

458
01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:15,140
a birdie on that hole as well no he didn't okay good first place all right I just I have to get

459
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:33,899
a par here this is it I can't fuck around I actually have to try hard here the time doesn't

460
01:28:33,899 --> 01:28:49,369
matter just click the coins Jeremy doesn't get golf Jeremy's in first place speaking in third

461
01:28:49,369 --> 01:29:04,970
person Jeremy you're not going to get the ice cream later why do you get to decide when I get

462
01:29:04,970 --> 01:29:10,539
to eat ice cream or not all right we're going for something hard here here we go this is gonna be

463
01:29:10,539 --> 01:29:25,020
this is this is ballsy this is ballsy oh don't go in the water all right it's good it's good it's

464
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:39,590
good it's good it's good it's good I bet you like pistachio ice cream yeah I do actually it's

465
01:29:39,590 --> 01:29:46,819
phenomenal all right all right all right we're gonna go a little bit overshoot it gonna curve

466
01:29:46,819 --> 01:29:58,579
a little bit right here get it on the green that was solid could have been better this is flat

467
01:30:00,869 --> 01:30:09,460
all right this is it I will win the tournament okay so this is very gently downhill or uphill

468
01:30:12,489 --> 01:30:20,470
wind is going this way a little bit I'm thinking right here but look it's the hill goes to the

469
01:30:20,470 --> 01:30:29,500
right all right wait this might not work out the way I want shit it wasn't even that strong

470
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:51,859
whatever I still win yep I win I got first place I'm good how many levels you got I gotta

471
01:30:51,859 --> 01:31:01,579
get at least four or five levels in the first place all right hold on stamina speed control

472
01:31:01,579 --> 01:31:13,539
spin I mean I'm thinking this right I honestly don't give a shit how fast I can run who cares

473
01:31:23,659 --> 01:31:30,550
control and power that means I can always my drives will always be right on the mark

474
01:31:30,550 --> 01:31:37,739
and then later on I can worry about how fast I'm running it doesn't really matter

475
01:31:47,420 --> 01:31:50,460
by the way why is it weird to like pistachio ice cream what's why is it so weird

476
01:31:51,180 --> 01:32:05,130
I thought that was pretty popular disgusting it is not I have a bad take for you pistachio ice

477
01:32:05,130 --> 01:32:18,550
cream is delicious pistachios are gross that's my bad take of the evening for you yeah I don't like

478
01:32:18,550 --> 01:32:33,430
pistachios but I like pistachio ice cream I think it's the added sugar that makes that pistachio

479
01:32:33,430 --> 01:32:47,720
flavor become very very good for me pistachio is the most amazing thing ever somebody told me

480
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:54,460
something about pistachios one time and it freaked me out and I forget what it was and it would turn

481
01:32:54,460 --> 01:32:58,939
me off from eating them forever and I what was it there's something weird about pistachios right

482
01:32:58,939 --> 01:33:11,270
isn't there something weird is it bugs I don't it's something about like them being like actually

483
01:33:11,270 --> 01:33:27,159
kind of gross you mean figs oh it's something weird something about like I'm gonna let me look

484
01:33:27,159 --> 01:33:31,960
this up before I like give you a total complete misinformation campaign here like let me get this

485
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:59,500
right what is it is it was it isn't a conspiracy I don't think so why are pistachios like bad

486
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:04,859
right like I'm just I don't I don't remember it was something weird that I was like no I don't

487
01:34:04,859 --> 01:34:11,699
want to eat those and it was something it was something like odd and I looked at it was like

488
01:34:11,699 --> 01:34:25,880
that's kind of weird not figs no figs is the wasp shit I know that was a clickbait was it

489
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:32,520
a fake news clickbait title no no no no it was I maybe it was like a I want to say I don't want

490
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:51,260
to say what I thought it was let me see oh I guess they were recalled pistachios at some point

491
01:34:55,050 --> 01:35:05,109
is that what this is this is like from a few years ago it caused farts and bloating

492
01:35:09,210 --> 01:35:16,460
that's not what this says you probably heard no I don't know what that is yeah

493
01:35:16,779 --> 01:35:20,779
there was like something weird like four or five years ago with like salmon whatever it is

494
01:35:28,220 --> 01:35:35,640
cashews are the ones that the fruit is poisonous no it wasn't cashews it was start the final round

495
01:35:35,640 --> 01:35:41,720
oh fuck I gotta pay attention ashes are covered in a strong maybe that is what it was

496
01:35:42,439 --> 01:35:53,340
maybe is that what it is does somebody get it aflatoxins is that what it was what it was

497
01:35:58,949 --> 01:36:04,470
aflatoxin a chemical in which can cause cancerous mold has been found in some mistreated pistachios

498
01:36:04,470 --> 01:36:09,590
and alleged breakouts of diseases that's all right so I wasn't crazy is that a legit article

499
01:36:09,590 --> 01:36:41,479
though pistachios contained toad spores source dude I told you me you trust me right it gives

500
01:36:41,479 --> 01:36:55,109
a yee-haw to prove your American citizenship what I don't think I could even do a good yee-haw

501
01:36:55,109 --> 01:37:02,470
it would probably be embarrassing you would think I would not pass your test that you have here

502
01:37:03,109 --> 01:37:27,239
all right this is the finals I don't know like eat like yee-haw like that but I feel like to do

503
01:37:27,239 --> 01:37:42,420
that you have to like lean back put your fist up and go like I get in this sand oh shit I did

504
01:37:42,420 --> 01:37:50,949
get in the sand this is bad all right I gotta pay attention what if I just drive it out of here can

505
01:37:50,949 --> 01:38:15,079
I do it no that's too that's too that's too risky too risky stay on the fairway please okay okay

506
01:38:15,079 --> 01:38:22,500
where's the wind going put it on the green right here it's safe it should get there

507
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:36,250
oh my god it went in it went oh it didn't go in that was close too damn all right that was

508
01:38:36,250 --> 01:38:56,010
really close what a recovery that was the only first place but no I pistachio flavor I think

509
01:38:56,010 --> 01:39:15,260
it's okay they kind of work go I like pistachio ice cream you know I'm kind of a weirdo I think

510
01:39:15,260 --> 01:39:26,569
I like it because it's green have you handed me vanilla ice cream and you handed me vanilla

511
01:39:26,569 --> 01:39:33,100
ice cream that was tinted a sky blue or like robin's egg blue I would like it more I would

512
01:39:33,100 --> 01:39:45,560
go oh wow this is awesome my imagination fills in the blanks all right where's the wind is going

513
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:58,250
a little bit this way we gotta go we're in 66 a little bit pull it up a little robin's egg blue

514
01:39:58,329 --> 01:40:09,319
oh it's on you like spinach I need to know I spinach is actually my favorite green vegetable

515
01:40:11,479 --> 01:40:29,449
yes I do very much so okay I got a minute and a half I'm fine so this has got a I think that's

516
01:40:29,449 --> 01:40:42,979
good till a little bit more I said so I don't know how to do it spinach is based spinach is the best

517
01:40:42,979 --> 01:40:56,119
green vegetable you can do tons of stuff with it you can saute it you can like mix it up it turns

518
01:40:56,119 --> 01:41:00,920
into a different thing you can eat spinach raw and if you cook it it turns into this weird like

519
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:06,760
kind of wilty soft delicious kind of juicy thing or you can eat it like salad like normal

520
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:17,130
it's very versatile so I know I don't I like spinach more than kale the scale kale is kind

521
01:41:17,130 --> 01:41:23,720
of weird it's got a weird texture you have to chew through it more it's a little stringy spinach

522
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:38,970
is way better I mean I think kale is probably better for you pound for pound nutrient density

523
01:41:38,970 --> 01:41:48,779
whatever but is that really that big of a deal he just turned it up I understand there's like

524
01:41:48,779 --> 01:41:54,569
tackling and pushing in this game but that was like a red card you know like where's the referee

525
01:41:55,210 --> 01:42:07,609
it was good in smoothies yeah kale is good when it's used I can't go through that tree yeah I can

526
01:42:07,609 --> 01:42:32,470
get through the tree yes yes it's actually up there it's actually all the way up there

527
01:42:33,109 --> 01:42:46,739
I'm on top of this hill too this actually is not a bad place to be

528
01:42:47,539 --> 01:43:10,279
this is gonna curve curved in that's pretty good all right I saved some time there I think

529
01:43:11,159 --> 01:43:24,779
what's the skybox for a second I see tearing I think I just go I it's not gonna be enough to

530
01:43:24,779 --> 01:43:32,979
affect the movement all the way down there's a little bit of pull this way I think this is

531
01:43:32,979 --> 01:43:45,020
gonna be fine it's not gonna hit her hard enough exactly what I was thinking was gonna happen

532
01:43:45,020 --> 01:43:48,539
that's exactly what I that's why I didn't want to do that hard I didn't want to go that far

533
01:43:49,180 --> 01:43:58,550
I just have to get pars that's all that matters I'm two strokes ahead of Chuck

534
01:43:59,109 --> 01:44:28,140
this way why not getting that this game sucks but you said sucks in all capitals

535
01:44:28,779 --> 01:44:39,640
remember this game sucks that was you were very upset about this I think it's fun

536
01:44:45,689 --> 01:44:50,729
what's your problem with it okay how about you tell me what you think about how bad that you

537
01:44:50,729 --> 01:45:13,619
don't like it and I'll tell you how bad I think it is okay it's not actually just messing around

538
01:45:13,619 --> 01:45:19,350
the side it's really not a bad game it's really fun I could see how you could just sit here and

539
01:45:19,350 --> 01:45:29,100
chill and play golf I get it it's fun this is the awful game to watch well golf is awful to watch

540
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:37,619
in general and what is this hill it's going right and left at the same time what am I supposed to

541
01:45:37,619 --> 01:46:06,710
do about this um I don't know nothing all right nice yeah way ahead ready golf really is one of

542
01:46:06,710 --> 01:46:14,119
those weird games at least in a video game sense I actually really don't mind playing golf in a

543
01:46:14,119 --> 01:46:29,079
video game but I really despise it playing it in real life it's truly do but it's kind of the

544
01:46:29,079 --> 01:46:35,590
opposite for baseball for me I would rather play a game of baseball in real life than play a video

545
01:46:35,590 --> 01:46:40,550
game of it I don't know about just getting the bat and getting up there and swinging

546
01:46:42,229 --> 01:47:09,739
on the reverse that's good get it well get out of the way it's not gonna make it I ran away with

547
01:47:09,739 --> 01:47:15,739
it though there's no way he comes back I would have to be a moron and get I'd have to do it

548
01:47:15,739 --> 01:47:55,140
intentionally bad as a joke somebody said Omega Lul he has negative points I got a p too Mario

549
01:47:55,140 --> 01:48:15,579
sluggers that was actually really good before I think this is a crazy idea this I want to get on

550
01:48:15,579 --> 01:48:28,069
green you to play Mario strikers I probably will play Mario strikers I was a huge fan of the uh

551
01:48:28,069 --> 01:48:59,140
one for the Wii let's chip this shit in play this all day no Elden Ring please that's probably not

552
01:48:59,140 --> 01:49:06,539
gonna happen I'm obsessed with Elden Ring right now somewhere at the halfway point I'm gonna take

553
01:49:06,539 --> 01:49:12,470
a little bit I'm gonna take like 15-20 minutes this could be a hole in one if I can get it

554
01:49:12,470 --> 01:49:41,210
it's gonna be close that's actually gonna be close you do a knitting scream I don't think

555
01:49:41,210 --> 01:49:59,130
that would be enjoyable I think you would all hate that ax out speed and you can tackle them

556
01:49:59,130 --> 01:50:11,850
all right only two holes left and I completed my first tournament are there many games I want to

557
01:50:11,850 --> 01:50:33,579
play mini games I'm so far ahead I can just literally relax just get the coins and the hearts

558
01:50:33,579 --> 01:50:38,949
and stuff what's what's wrong with the music I don't understand people don't like the music

559
01:50:39,829 --> 01:50:47,100
what's the problem with the music everyone's like music turn it off please

560
01:50:48,739 --> 01:51:23,500
okay it's because it's on a five second loop it kind of is I would have had that

561
01:51:39,750 --> 01:51:45,859
it is the same song I haven't paid any attention oh my god Yoshi you're plus 10

562
01:51:53,189 --> 01:51:57,989
is Yoshi doing the thing at mini golf where you're infuriated and you're not having a good time

563
01:51:59,289 --> 01:52:03,130
so you just drag the ball three or four times when you get it close enough and you don't care

564
01:52:07,289 --> 01:52:12,010
you mess up and you just drag drag drag in and it counts as like four strokes

565
01:52:12,979 --> 01:52:32,949
is that what you're doing right now Yoshi just drive it that's where my skills are

566
01:52:32,949 --> 01:52:43,750
uh

567
01:52:43,750 --> 01:53:01,210
it actually has been this for an hour how do I go in the sand what I'm so far ahead who

568
01:53:01,210 --> 01:53:34,680
fucking cares just drive it there it is oh shit I don't want to hit anybody with this

569
01:53:38,149 --> 01:53:45,800
wait do I have to go get it I don't have to go get it right it's out of bounds it's out of bounds

570
01:53:45,800 --> 01:54:17,979
I I can't get that okay close I win plus 12 I got my first medal the star cup

571
01:54:19,350 --> 01:54:27,479
there's not two other pedestals only one for first place thousand coins and probably leveled up like

572
01:54:27,479 --> 01:54:44,520
five times oh yeah your special dash improved all right so control is fine spin I don't really care

573
01:54:44,520 --> 01:55:08,500
about that I'll do stamina head to ridge rock lake this dude's doing an endurance build

574
01:55:09,300 --> 01:55:38,579

575
01:55:38,579 --> 01:55:43,829

576
01:55:44,760 --> 01:55:51,770

577
01:55:51,770 --> 02:00:43,539
for two hours all right I'll be right back I'm gonna pee give me two seconds yeah what's that

579
02:00:51,579 --> 02:00:58,569
it's like it's probably like a four it's in though yeah if I just keep pretending to like it

580
02:00:59,770 --> 02:01:08,380
fans will you know so yeah so to keep pretending to like it even though I can fucking hate it

581
02:01:09,020 --> 02:01:17,689
that's just pretty yeah I see look oh my god I just got caught oh my god I got caught

582
02:01:20,810 --> 02:01:47,159
no no no no no all right let's go this is kind of cool there's a map I love the hot mic joke it's

583
02:01:47,159 --> 02:02:01,619
it's the worst fucking joke it really is it's not it's not it's the worst one oh new area

584
02:02:02,340 --> 02:02:18,470
is that putting practice congrats on the chrome badge x is bronze you check to see if your mic

585
02:02:18,470 --> 02:02:24,390
is off I mean I have a little thing where I turn it off and on like a little button I press

586
02:02:25,189 --> 02:02:27,989
sometimes I don't press it sometimes I'm just like what oh I don't really care

587
02:02:35,659 --> 02:02:49,050
big storm won't be any tournaments for a while what we can't hear anything yeah you can have

588
02:02:49,050 --> 02:02:57,590
you ever heard of cross-country golf xc golf for short believe it or not xc golf goes way back it's

589
02:02:57,590 --> 02:03:03,479
a form of the game that many of the top players have mastered some of the really high level

590
02:03:03,479 --> 02:03:09,500
players can still play our course even in this state it's remarkable to see them in action of

591
02:03:09,500 --> 02:03:16,920
course they can use special shots so it's not exactly fair maybe you saw mario in that televised

592
02:03:16,920 --> 02:03:22,170
I was I thought he's gonna say commercial you've already seen a special shot some of them are so

593
02:03:22,170 --> 02:03:25,369
powerful that they can affect other players and blast their golf balls out of the way

594
02:03:29,109 --> 02:03:43,319
okay interesting so everybody has a special move I get it so should I just play the regular game

595
02:03:43,319 --> 02:03:58,039
mode and just pick a character and just go play that sounds like something interesting

596
02:04:03,510 --> 02:04:08,699
pick seven clubs there's a lot of elevation change the nine iron look I don't know okay

597
02:04:09,500 --> 02:04:26,489
let me tell you what I need I need the driver I need six iron pitching wedge this is changing

598
02:04:26,489 --> 02:04:41,020
golf attire okay yeah I don't even want that maybe I'll take it I'll take a six iron I'll take the

599
02:04:41,020 --> 02:04:52,060
six hybrid sounds good successfully downloaded data for pick cross he really just fucking expose

600
02:04:52,060 --> 02:05:10,819
me like that all right let's try it no I don't want to change gear you find yourself in a really

601
02:05:10,819 --> 02:05:17,659
tricky spot and we all do from time to time you're not totally out of luck all right I'll be fine

602
02:05:17,659 --> 02:05:30,619
play a practice round of xc golf verifying badge confirmed registration for xc golf practice round

603
02:05:30,619 --> 02:05:37,819
complete complete three holes and 30 strokes or fewer to advance okay may encounter tornadoes on

604
02:05:37,819 --> 02:05:47,880
the course this is normal this they may be used to edit okay be careful there are hazards sure

605
02:05:49,909 --> 02:05:57,220
drops from flat lies will fly straight yeah lots of uphill will curve downhill will curve

606
02:05:57,220 --> 02:06:03,560
yeah yeah yeah the moral yeah yeah yeah all right I'm not gonna play pick cross right now I'm okay

607
02:06:03,560 --> 02:06:17,930
stop tornadoes on the course will blow both golfers and golf balls into the sky okay

608
02:06:18,569 --> 02:06:37,819
did I do that wait there are two different holes so you have to okay all right I got an idea

609
02:06:38,920 --> 02:06:57,140
is this stupid will this go into that wind and go up that didn't do anything I thought it was

610
02:06:57,140 --> 02:07:06,970
gonna go in the tornado and go up I guess not oh well okay never mind all right I gotta be

611
02:07:06,970 --> 02:07:19,899
careful huge wind pushing this way so I'm gonna sit right here big curve as well I'll go too far

612
02:07:24,250 --> 02:07:29,300
pretty good said watch out for them don't go directly into them but I thought it was

613
02:07:29,300 --> 02:07:38,149
gonna make the ball bounce up that's a that's steep I think that's the one right there

614
02:07:41,770 --> 02:07:47,130
ah again I keep messing that up it's the worst dream it's not pick cross I'm not playing pick

615
02:07:47,130 --> 02:07:57,939
cross stop asking for it or I'm gonna be very upset with you so now we go again oh okay this is

616
02:07:57,939 --> 02:08:12,340
kind of I this is actually cool I do genuinely like this it's gonna hit the wall oh it does work

617
02:08:12,340 --> 02:08:34,140
so why didn't it work last time I said this is downhill a little bit big wind I'm not playing

618
02:08:34,140 --> 02:08:46,619
pick I'm not playing pick Ross no no I'll play pick Ross later this is gonna be like a 10 hour

619
02:08:46,619 --> 02:09:01,939
stream will you guys just just buckle up oh no I did this completely wrong there's the wind

620
02:09:01,939 --> 02:09:16,819
okay tornado this way I should go into that tornado and go up please make it I'm fine

621
02:09:19,239 --> 02:09:27,079
I'm not gonna play pick Ross for like four hours oh I gotta go across the whole fucking game again

622
02:09:27,079 --> 02:09:48,170
god damn it I'll play a few rounds of pick Ross no later than at least 45 minutes from right now

623
02:09:48,729 --> 02:10:00,220
okay will that actually go up will that travel up in the tornado I hope so as if I'm doing it

624
02:10:00,779 --> 02:10:15,739
watch out we were kidding don't that's what I'm saying I know you guys are such fucking

625
02:10:15,739 --> 02:10:43,140
jokers not even gonna get on the green what an idiot 17 strokes left oh no nice

626
02:10:44,180 --> 02:10:50,279
I knew this was gonna happen I knew it was gonna happen

627
02:10:57,319 --> 02:11:08,550
44 minutes until pick Ross maybe all right let's do it for real I was tracking my every move

628
02:11:09,109 --> 02:11:19,670
let's do it let's register for a standard xc golf tournament that was actually pretty cool

629
02:11:20,569 --> 02:11:41,930
you can approach that a bunch of different ways let's go use your coins how do I use my coins

630
02:11:45,270 --> 02:11:57,560
how to play no who sells shit here somebody sells something who is the shop keeper over here

631
02:11:59,939 --> 02:12:18,600
okay welcome anything you want to buy bullet bill for a hybrid where's the where is it

632
02:12:36,020 --> 02:12:52,020
is this it let me just see if this is it no where is this commercial for this fucking driver

633
02:12:53,380 --> 02:13:19,510
I don't know boomerang oh these are good I want those okay so then rana plant makes it easier

634
02:13:19,510 --> 02:13:31,369
to control shots out of deep ruffin mud I kind of want the bullet bill hybrid I mean why wouldn't

635
02:13:31,369 --> 02:13:51,979
I use that elevation finder yeah okay what do you sell food all right let me put those uh let me

636
02:13:51,979 --> 02:14:19,319
put that stuff on okay all right I think we're good I thought there were no golf cards you were

637
02:14:19,319 --> 02:14:23,960
clear for three holes of standard xc golf progress in any order complete the required

638
02:14:23,960 --> 02:14:36,149
holes in 30 strokes mm-hmm wait there's a shot clock now I know how a spin shot works

639
02:14:45,369 --> 02:14:55,819
can you die in this I'm no you can't you have two minutes to hit and reach your ball before

640
02:14:55,819 --> 02:15:04,899
you be assessed a stroke penalty buddy okay that doesn't seem that big of a deal at least not yet

641
02:15:05,800 --> 02:15:26,500
not initially this game is a unity asset swap I think it's a little better I that's better than

642
02:15:26,500 --> 02:15:38,810
that what do the coins do I just purchased a few things you can buy uh upgrades and that the guy

643
02:15:38,810 --> 02:16:02,390
that guy's gonna hit me isn't he what all right watch it we got high wind oh I thought that was

644
02:16:02,390 --> 02:16:15,779
the pitching wedge I didn't think I I didn't think that was a putter I thought I had the pitching

645
02:16:15,779 --> 02:16:25,020
wedge on why do I sound like that I've been going straight on I'm just gonna hit it as hard as I can

646
02:16:31,739 --> 02:16:46,149
shit sorry that'll go in how do I get up there what is it doing what what are you talking about

647
02:16:52,540 --> 02:17:05,209
didn't go in the uh didn't go in the thing here um how am I supposed to handle this

648
02:17:23,590 --> 02:17:38,680
all right I made it up there where is it all right I made it yep now I use it good

649
02:17:42,120 --> 02:18:14,020
now this is downhill heavy winds I'm so bad at putting it's fine I have 19 strokes left

650
02:18:18,819 --> 02:18:43,829
oh my god I went the wrong way again ah now I understand where the stamina comes from

651
02:18:43,829 --> 02:18:57,030
I didn't think it was gonna be this important is this game open world it is not this is just kind

652
02:18:57,030 --> 02:19:05,670
of a cool game mode where you have to sink in three different holes in a certain amount of strokes

653
02:19:05,750 --> 02:19:10,069
which I'll give him credit it's time to give uh the super nintendo developer some credit

654
02:19:11,450 --> 02:19:17,770
that's cool that's a cool spin on golf it just increased the letter grid but here's the problem

655
02:19:18,329 --> 02:19:31,610
how do I all right I'm gonna go nine can I do nine iron six iron might do it nine iron might

656
02:19:31,610 --> 02:20:08,700
just barely get over the hill I'm going for it fuck I gotta get it up there uh shit um okay

657
02:20:12,379 --> 02:20:17,819
wait it did go up wait what what happened am I I'm I've lost my mind I don't know what's going on

658
02:20:18,540 --> 02:20:45,829
is it bad wait how hard did I just hit that it's right here we're good I did this completely

659
02:20:45,829 --> 02:21:00,020
wrong but whatever whoa I can break those this case pretty good this is gonna this is gonna

660
02:21:00,020 --> 02:21:15,659
slice like crazy so I'm gonna hit it this way why was that not even a slice the game just told me

661
02:21:15,659 --> 02:21:31,020
oh my god dude you're fucked think it in you should please do the let's freaking go voice

662
02:21:33,620 --> 02:21:46,819
nice maybe I will in a minute that was fun I like this I'm not moving yet please do it

663
02:21:52,469 --> 02:21:59,030
that was solid seems like you're figuring out xc golf I think you'd do well in a competition

664
02:21:59,030 --> 02:22:02,790
making good progress on course repairs so we should be ready to host some kind of a competition soon

665
02:22:03,510 --> 02:22:16,200
play a standard round of xc golf all right let's do it the next stream should be you going golfing

666
02:22:16,200 --> 02:22:22,860
the next big stream I would just slice the ball we do a big thing where I elaborately oh I'm

667
02:22:22,860 --> 02:22:27,579
gonna do nine holes of golf I get up there I tee up and I would slice the ball so bad that we I'd

668
02:22:27,579 --> 02:22:43,219
lose the ball and get frustrated and probably stop streaming off infuriates me I need to do

669
02:22:43,219 --> 02:22:49,000
six holes in 35 strokes all right I gotta be careful this actually is where the game begins

670
02:22:56,409 --> 02:23:03,700
ready all right there are six go we gotta go this way first go that was like in my ear that was

671
02:23:03,700 --> 02:23:17,879
weird all right we're gonna go this way this is gonna make it well this is gonna bounce right off

672
02:23:17,879 --> 02:23:33,530
the edge isn't it might not it's gonna bounce right off it why would I don't be more concerned

673
02:23:33,530 --> 02:23:49,479
about the tree that's there and not the rock now I have to sand wedge it up there can I can I sand

674
02:23:49,479 --> 02:24:16,469
wedge it up please come on sand wedge yes all right how do I get up there okay we're good

675
02:24:16,469 --> 02:24:27,590
it's up on another ledge all right another sandwich I'm not far enough

676
02:24:31,420 --> 02:24:42,549
wait where was that gonna end up okay so if I do six iron at about 50% I'm gonna say 50% speed

677
02:24:43,270 --> 02:24:49,690
it's gonna slice a little I'm gonna do nine iron we're doing nine iron straight on

678
02:24:57,639 --> 02:25:10,059
yep yep all right nice were you thinking of the hammer driver infomercial I don't know it's like

679
02:25:10,059 --> 02:25:18,790
from like 1998 or something I don't know what it is but that's you can't that's just illegal

680
02:25:21,020 --> 02:25:30,059
okay where is this thing over here all right we're almost there I'm gonna drive it here it's

681
02:25:30,059 --> 02:25:45,219
gonna curve a little this next part shouldn't be too bad god damn it this one sucks to get to I

682
02:25:45,219 --> 02:26:05,979
have 30 strokes left I'm okay okay right before the putt why is he talking like he's fighting an

683
02:26:05,979 --> 02:26:18,649
Elden Ring boss because that's the only thing I've done for two straight weeks get the putter

684
02:26:18,649 --> 02:26:33,739
out can't tell I had to hit it way harder because it was in the fucking rough whatever

685
02:26:34,299 --> 02:26:46,090
all right 28 strokes we need five more holes they're all over there um I'm gonna say we're

686
02:26:46,090 --> 02:27:00,100
gonna go the one all the way to the right look how far apart these are these things are so far away

687
02:27:00,739 --> 02:27:34,700
what all right move straight again oh my god is this gonna can I actually make that I wonder

688
02:27:38,680 --> 02:27:57,479
oh that's what those fucking idiots get over here all right change plan I gotta go this one

689
02:27:57,479 --> 02:28:12,250
what the heck is this dude I'm playing Mario Golf this is just a game my twitch analytics

690
02:28:17,030 --> 02:28:32,649
so I'm so my whole directory is not Elden Ring there's got to be at least three hours of Mario

691
02:28:32,649 --> 02:28:37,290
Golf so it will fit into the algorithm of like other games that I've played in the last month

692
02:28:37,930 --> 02:28:55,989
that's good and oh yeah and Picross will be there too that's right

693
02:28:56,790 --> 02:29:12,459
you got a good point okay this is still very possible because I need I have to go this way

694
02:29:12,459 --> 02:29:15,500
now we're gonna go this way we're gonna go over to the right and then I'm gonna come down into

695
02:29:15,500 --> 02:29:21,100
the middle again should be all right what's the wind like all right wind is blowing a lot this way

696
02:29:21,979 --> 02:29:44,020
I'm gonna go a little bit short right there watch out for the tree oh 30 more minutes to meet the

697
02:29:44,020 --> 02:29:51,530
Mario Golf quota I mean it's not this isn't a bounty or anything

698
02:30:04,219 --> 02:30:20,659
wait did I do that did I fuck up the tree oh this is gonna slice like crazy okay 38 yards

699
02:30:30,069 --> 02:30:39,979
oh there was a lot of wind too though don't mess this up it's very very very steep and I have to

700
02:30:39,979 --> 02:30:52,920
hit it not that hard right there right here perfect god fucking damn it I'll never get it

701
02:31:00,889 --> 02:31:05,129
what the fuck what I was trying to skip through where is it going

702
02:31:08,709 --> 02:31:19,100
well that's not good I was trying to skip the dialogue sequence this is really uphill though

703
02:31:19,659 --> 02:32:04,379
will this make it oh I did I got it okay same thing here uh it's not gonna work oh this is bad

704
02:32:05,020 --> 02:32:17,719
I have to tornado it but I can't I have 16 strokes left I'm not gonna be able to do this

705
02:32:18,360 --> 02:32:45,270
I need to how am I gonna do this a hundred feet I gotta go like that didn't do anything

706
02:32:52,940 --> 02:33:01,719
okay all right all right that's it I got it now it's over this is ruined how are you supposed

707
02:33:01,719 --> 02:33:09,459
to reliably get up there yeah this is this is ruined I have to it's gotta go like over here

708
02:33:14,100 --> 02:33:31,959
wait all right that's good that's not what I wanted to do I mean I'm screwed either way honestly so

709
02:33:32,680 --> 02:33:37,940
does it really matter let's keep zooming out so far like what are you doing

710
02:33:39,379 --> 02:33:56,280
what's with this shit view what is with this terrible fucking camera will this get picked

711
02:33:56,280 --> 02:34:04,069
up by the thing I hope so yep there it is okay I don't think I'm gonna have enough strokes to do it

712
02:34:04,790 --> 02:34:36,219
oh my god it's still not even close wait what where's the ball what's going on why does it say

713
02:34:36,219 --> 02:34:54,840
it's down why is the ball down here did you go out of bounds I'm very confused what happened

714
02:34:54,840 --> 02:35:19,379
there's a penalty it's got to go right through the middle it's grayed out over there all right

715
02:35:19,379 --> 02:35:22,979
well this is obviously just restart the whole fucking thing restart restart this is stupid

716
02:35:23,540 --> 02:35:35,610
restart I forgot Nintendo does the thing where it's remember I told you I I want a fucking I

717
02:35:35,610 --> 02:35:44,940
want a I want Congress to pass a law a is b and b is a across all these different consoles

718
02:35:44,940 --> 02:35:50,620
Nintendo wants you to press the right button to accept stuff xbox says no bro hit the bottom

719
02:35:50,620 --> 02:36:23,559
button I'm gonna get congress involved all right straight ahead this dude's high on wallpaper glue

720
02:36:24,440 --> 02:36:38,899
hey you don't understand we gotta get the president has to get involved a is b and b is a

721
02:36:38,899 --> 02:36:56,940
across Nintendo and xbox you don't understand it's really pissing me off don't okay they should have

722
02:36:56,940 --> 02:37:03,940
all come to an agreement a long time ago okay is it wrong for me to say that if your controller

723
02:37:03,940 --> 02:37:13,260
is xyba and the competitor's controller is xyba just just come to a fucking agreement and shake

724
02:37:13,260 --> 02:37:16,219
hands in an office somewhere and be like look we're gonna have the same button with commands

725
02:37:16,219 --> 02:37:22,940
right like we're going to see playstation gets to fuck around because they're symbols well it's not

726
02:37:22,940 --> 02:37:29,020
we have square and triangle all right whatever fuck you go you go live in your own world xyba

727
02:37:29,020 --> 02:37:37,059
should be the same across the platforms that have xyba this is literally who cares

728
02:37:37,860 --> 02:38:07,719
I do is all downhill is he about to start crying I've I've been really trying to hold it this whole

729
02:38:07,719 --> 02:38:15,370
time okay so don't go that way honest to god don't go that way what's the route what's the

730
02:38:15,370 --> 02:38:26,500
right route it's probably to the left over here it has to be as I go across this gap there it is

731
02:38:26,500 --> 02:38:35,989
downhill don't go so hard we're gonna do six iron at about 140 yards I'm thinking a bit of strong

732
02:38:35,989 --> 02:38:58,500
wind we'll handle it all right nice okay time for pick cross it's not time for pick cross it's time

733
02:38:58,500 --> 02:39:09,620
for pick cross when I say I'm gonna play pick cross that's not right now I need to hit it a

734
02:39:09,620 --> 02:39:31,959
little bit harder than I want to that's in come on that's such bullshit now we go this way which

735
02:39:31,959 --> 02:39:41,620
will take us oh there's that one over there shit I'm gonna have to get that one later

736
02:39:44,760 --> 02:39:48,040
all right if I go as hard as I can I can get this at least to the sand trap

737
02:39:48,680 --> 02:39:54,969
I'm going right there wind is blowing a little bit too we're gonna be going full blast into the

738
02:39:54,969 --> 02:40:11,159
wind the tornado wind don't fucking screw me here the tornado what happened to the tornado

739
02:40:14,680 --> 02:40:28,549
now it's I'm in big trouble in Japan the a button is on the bottom on the west Xbox has patents for

740
02:40:28,549 --> 02:40:42,840
button bottom button on a that can't be real if it is that's fucking insane now I'm so screwed

741
02:40:42,840 --> 02:40:50,340
what do I do now I can't just keep whacking into the wall I guess this way I'll have to come back

742
02:40:54,379 --> 02:41:15,020
that'll make it over that hill I hope everyone ps1 games had confirm on circle well that's the

743
02:41:15,020 --> 02:41:24,379
thing confirm is where circle is on this way on just Nintendo circle is the rightmost button

744
02:41:26,149 --> 02:41:35,940
a is the rightmost button and that's confirmed on Nintendo it was like that on SNES too yeah and

745
02:41:35,940 --> 02:41:44,360
then Xbox came along put a on the bottom and made that confirm what are they thinking how am I going

746
02:41:44,360 --> 02:41:54,420
to lie I can't just run up here I don't think am I going I don't think I can walk up here

747
02:41:55,059 --> 02:42:12,250
I have 30 seconds to do this but 25 strokes I think I need to level up before I go here

748
02:42:12,969 --> 02:42:27,750
look at this this is horrible 38 yards all right I'm gonna go like here all right not bad nice

749
02:42:32,520 --> 02:42:47,190
straight on nothing fancy because you're under leveled

750
02:42:49,190 --> 02:42:58,549
I probably am 22 strokes I have three holes left this is gonna be a monumental pain in the ass

751
02:42:59,190 --> 02:43:03,479
to get to the one down there but I have to take what I can take and it's this here

752
02:43:16,280 --> 02:43:20,200
once that countdown for Picross ends you're gonna be very upset when I don't play the game

753
02:43:31,959 --> 02:43:45,750
are these worth one coin now I'll play a couple of rounds of Picross I will

754
02:43:46,469 --> 02:44:01,799
it's gonna be weird with the controller though gonna curve a little bit this wind a lot of wind

755
02:44:02,520 --> 02:44:25,540
I'm not sure what hurts more just gonna go like this another broken pixel finally okay 19 strokes

756
02:44:25,540 --> 02:44:31,209
to get two holes this is the hard one this is the one that I'm I have trouble understanding

757
02:44:31,770 --> 02:44:40,790
I think I have to hit it really hard just smash it so it flies up or I don't know how hard do I

758
02:44:40,790 --> 02:44:51,930
have to hit this with a six uh six iron I don't know I think I just have to smash it full power

759
02:44:51,930 --> 02:45:23,430
with the six iron yeah did it go what no it came all the way back uh I have to put this back over

760
02:45:23,430 --> 02:45:34,780
here there's no hit it with the driver and do backspin I gotta get it back over there

761
02:45:35,500 --> 02:45:47,260
I have to get this back in a different a better spot no not into the sand thing god damn it I

762
02:45:47,260 --> 02:45:57,530
didn't want to hit it that hard thank god okay all right drive it and then put how do I do backspin

763
02:45:58,329 --> 02:46:03,399
standard shot oops no no no no no no I did I wanted to choose I didn't get to choose

764
02:46:05,350 --> 02:46:09,030
fucking come on I didn't want to do that I was trying to choose a different like spin

765
02:46:11,959 --> 02:46:32,629
it actually got up there how did that happen I think I can do this spin doesn't matter for

766
02:46:32,629 --> 02:46:51,860
what you're trying to do okay this is the hard one this is the one that sucks okay this is going

767
02:46:51,860 --> 02:47:02,739
to curve a lot and there's a lot of wind so I'm going to run into it here all right 15 strokes

768
02:47:02,739 --> 02:47:18,950
to get one hole there's one more across the whole game I just have to drive it over and over again

769
02:47:18,950 --> 02:47:28,040
until I get there right oh I should approach from here right because how is that how uphill is that

770
02:47:28,280 --> 02:47:42,409
I wonder I'm gonna approach from this way god I hope I make this how am I gonna get there

771
02:47:44,500 --> 02:48:08,459
I only have two minutes it didn't make it yes it did I was looking way too far this is cool though

772
02:48:16,250 --> 02:48:24,069
I do have to get up there though I don't know how that's gonna happen I don't know I just have to

773
02:48:24,069 --> 02:48:36,420
guess I gotta go over that dude there's no way um I have to get it on there first I have I have 13

774
02:48:36,420 --> 02:48:55,110
strokes I'm gonna be all right I gotta go from here to there there's wait um I don't know I could

775
02:48:55,110 --> 02:49:00,709
hit it that way but I don't think it'll get over there that thing's downhill all right I'm just

776
02:49:00,709 --> 02:49:07,059
gonna I'm just fucking sending it who cares it's gotta go in this general direction I don't care

777
02:49:07,059 --> 02:49:38,340
where we're good okay hey I'm actually gonna complete it so this is down I'll just send it

778
02:49:38,340 --> 02:50:01,579
again I think it'll cross over it should make it across it did all right nice sims music is

779
02:50:01,579 --> 02:50:12,659
better than this where's the Mario music all right 11 strokes this would be hard to mess up

780
02:50:23,100 --> 02:50:44,420
Mario's not in this game I think it okay that was good you got it this isn't a Mario game

781
02:50:45,459 --> 02:51:08,139
he's in the title I have to put I have to whoa why are you doing that what's going on with this

782
02:51:08,139 --> 02:51:34,139
bullshit I lose points in the other one oh this is bad I don't want to do the qualifier

783
02:51:34,139 --> 02:51:46,420
I have a pick cross this is fun though I like this all right I have to give it a rating so far

784
02:51:46,420 --> 02:51:52,180
the person said that if this was not at least a 7.0 and I that person gets banned for a month

785
02:51:52,180 --> 02:52:12,739
they're in pre-stream chat hmm do what hmm this is not a seven don't kid yourself

786
02:52:13,299 --> 02:52:26,549
the thing is though it could be it actually could be it's gonna take me actually another

787
02:52:26,549 --> 02:52:33,780
few minutes to figure this out let me try some of the mini games first doesn't that can really

03:00:04,200 --> 03:00:11,379
this is so this is champ difficulty which just means they're gonna get it in the middle every time

816
03:00:20,760 --> 03:00:29,399
yeah it's gonna be a perfect shot every time Mario is gonna mess it up he's like a comedian

817
03:00:29,399 --> 03:00:46,629
right where's Picross you'll see it in a minute okay ball one ball change what's this

818
03:00:48,629 --> 03:01:04,309
egg ball key change what's the ball do what's the egg ball do just further away with more points

819
03:01:04,950 --> 03:01:27,180
and does that mean that the middle's already been claimed play it safe okay no win play it safe

820
03:01:27,819 --> 03:01:43,340
it's downhill I need like one like right like here that's what it does it bounces around

821
03:01:43,340 --> 03:01:49,639
roll back all right whatever you're having a great day uh I'm having a pretty good day yeah

822
03:01:49,639 --> 03:02:03,530
hope you're having a good day what was that oh get out of here with this bullshit yeah okay

823
03:02:03,530 --> 03:02:36,440
I was gonna say that shuts points off nothing come on hurry up what I'm in type of third place

824
03:02:37,239 --> 03:02:55,930
all right I have one opportunity here I gotta go with this middle ring here it should land

825
03:02:55,930 --> 03:03:08,969
and bounce right into it how are you this bad at Mario Golf I'm about to potentially tie for first

826
03:03:08,969 --> 03:03:16,899
place on champion difficulty Bowser is does get can't get enough points to save him here

827
03:03:17,459 --> 03:03:22,579
as you just saw I'm literally tied for first place and I literally might be tied for first

828
03:03:22,579 --> 03:03:35,690
place at the literal end of this game that what does Rosalina do bad keep going whatever

829
03:03:35,690 --> 03:03:48,170
I come in second place he's literally uh there's not even enough points to get enough to win yeah

830
03:03:48,170 --> 03:04:00,180
I'm second place I'll take second place that's fine 60 I don't understand why they give him extra

831
03:04:00,180 --> 03:04:28,709
points without literally next game uh it's not over yet that's too bouncy all right I'm gonna

832
03:04:28,709 --> 03:04:44,659
play Picross that was kind of fun that was that was fun that was fun I gotta give you a rating

833
03:04:44,659 --> 03:04:57,659
though and I think you're gonna have to ban that guy for a month but hear me out let's figure it

834
03:04:57,659 --> 03:05:05,139
out I think it's a solid experience like it's fun it needs to be a seven out of ten or that person

835
03:05:05,139 --> 03:05:14,090
is banned for one full month what makes it bad though bad's a wrong word what makes it not over

836
03:05:14,090 --> 03:05:22,870
a seven for me I feel like this game is a game that you it's like on the tv in the college dorm

837
03:05:22,870 --> 03:05:30,489
room and that makes it an eight you know what I mean like this is a college dorm room game

838
03:05:30,489 --> 03:05:39,420
which makes it a solid eight as a uh as a 36 year old in his office alone I wouldn't say that

839
03:05:50,120 --> 03:05:55,100
you know I'm gonna be fair I actually okay with that in mind this is like a really good

840
03:05:55,100 --> 03:05:59,180
piece down like you're in like a college dorm room with friends everyone's like you know

841
03:05:59,180 --> 03:06:04,969
it's like talking shit and like oh my god you fucked up my shot that's an eight but it's a

842
03:06:04,969 --> 03:06:09,290
six for me sitting here playing it by myself so therefore the average is probably somewhere around

843
03:06:09,290 --> 03:06:27,139
7.0 7.1 I'm gonna give this game a 7.2 but they can stay I think this actually could be really

844
03:06:27,139 --> 03:06:35,739
fun with a group of people more than three or four people all hanging out in a call playing this

845
03:06:36,459 --> 03:06:50,010
yep that's an 8.0 game for sure maybe more 7.2 it's good and there's like a story mode too it's

846
03:06:50,010 --> 03:06:54,569
not just like all right that's good it's good I don't I didn't hate it all right let's play

847
03:06:54,569 --> 03:07:04,840
pick ross and then we're gonna play elden ring this is the worst game ever made it's not

848
03:07:09,799 --> 03:07:18,409
you gave monster wrencher a 4.2 no idea when did I give monster I gave monster

849
03:07:18,409 --> 03:07:24,709
wrencher like a nine what are you talking about all right I need is pick ross is just on my

850
03:07:24,709 --> 03:07:24,950
pump
