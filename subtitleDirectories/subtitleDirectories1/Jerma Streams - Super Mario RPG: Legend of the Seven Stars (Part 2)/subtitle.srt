1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:22,039
Hello? Can anybody hear me? Hello? What's up? Who is this? Who's this? You called me. Oh, okay. Yeah.

2
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:32,570
Yeah, yes, my number is one number off of your number. Okay, cool. That's really great. Um,

3
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:42,020
that makes me happy. Okay, please never call me again. Goodbye. Great. That was fun. It's

4
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:58,520
seven o'clock in the fucking morning. You guys never heard of that? I know it's not. I was doing

5
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:06,569
a bit. I was doing a routine. There was a big spotlight on me and I had the mic in my hand

6
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:13,829
and the house lights are down. Spotlight, bang. I go into my bit, my performance. No clapping.

7
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:21,540
Don't, no clapping. House lights come down. Bang, spotlight. Here we go. I'm going. Oh,

8
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:33,930
let's clap. I can't. We're not clapping. No, he's just going. Okay. See what I mean? Let's go.

9
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:39,879
All right. Get it back on. Get it back on. I'm not ready yet. You can clap.

10
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:50,709
You can clap. So today we're going to do Mario RPG again. We're going to do Terraria

11
00:01:51,799 --> 00:02:03,819
tonight, but Star and I could not sync up good. We had our days mixed up, apparently. I thought

12
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:08,780
we were doing it Monday. Apparently we had that wrong, I guess. I thought I thought I said Monday,

13
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:15,830
but whatever. It's all right. It's all good. So we're going to do that probably a different day

14
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:22,069
or Terraria is kind of just cursed. So it seems like every time something happens,

15
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:29,370
like Star's computer breaks like three weeks ago and then two weeks ago, my internet like doesn't

16
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:40,659
work at all. And then we mix our days up this time. Let's just pretend we beat the moon boss.

17
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:49,460
There he is. Is he here? I thought it was a different day. No, it's fine. It don't matter.

18
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:55,860
I mean, I did, I mean, I, you know, I did clearly if you scroll up in the PMs,

19
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,490
I did clearly say Monday. And if you scroll up in those PMs,

20
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:11,800
he's fucking so mad. No, it's all good. Terraria is just like a relaxing, fun game to play. Anyways,

21
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:28,729
here comes another year long joke. Release the email. It's all good. But so what we're going to

22
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:36,379
do is just because we couldn't, I wanted to start around like 334. So I didn't want to have another

23
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:41,419
scenario where it's like, oh, let's set a 30 minute, 40 minute setup time because Terraria

24
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:52,500
multiplayer fucking doesn't work half the time. But we love Star. We do. But we also love Super

25
00:03:52,500 --> 00:04:00,099
Mario as well. We'll do something someday. Maybe tomorrow. No, not tomorrow. Maybe like

26
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:08,340
next weekend. No, we should start. No, we should actually do. We should just get to the end

27
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:15,750
of Terraria and just turn the stream on and have the last base game boss have one HP left.

28
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,500
And then just be like, like fucking screaming and stuff that we did it. And then just move

29
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:33,000
on to our own game and then end the streams. Oh God. Anyways, I'm going to pick up what we

30
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,240
left off yesterday on Super Mario RPG legend of the seven stars. I got voices.

31
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:45,879
The throat is voiced. My throat is lubricated. It's well rested. He's starting his tuber voice.

32
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:51,769
That's how you know it's ready to start the let's play continuation. We have five of them.

33
00:04:52,730 --> 00:05:15,670
And they're distinct. I'll prove it to you. Oh, that's four. Hold on. This one. This one. This one.

34
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:26,339
This one. And this one. There you go. You got five distinct voices. Told you.

35
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:41,620
All right. So we left off. We got the princess. Princess join the party.

36
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:55,370
We now have to go unravel the mysteries of, uh, I don't know. I've played this game a thousand

37
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,930
times. I don't fucking remember what happens next. All right. We go through to marry more.

38
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:08,300
We go to booster's pass. First of all, because something happened here last time. You can't do

39
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:14,259
the Malo voice because you don't use Malo. Yes, I can. I didn't say five distinct currently on

40
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:32,620
camera voices. I just said just five distinct voices. Oops. I fell down. We want Malo. Well,

41
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:41,019
Malo is not in the, you know what, for the first time ever, I may replace genome. It's possible.

42
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:50,500
I don't know. I haven't decided yet. Here we go. Come on. Let's bring out a sixth. Golly,

43
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:56,490
you're that famous Mario. Nope. Golly, you're that famous Mario guy. If I beat you,

44
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:06,709
they'll make me sniff at number four. If I'm lucky. Here we go. You ain't going to be sniffed at

45
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:24,410
number four. You're going to be sniffed at number six feet under. Well, now they'll make me take

46
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:48,100
the training course over again. Slow down. Okay. Flower tab. Broad coin. Kero Kero Cola. Got it.

47
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:55,449
I got the secret. I got the secret. Oh, Mario just fell off the base of the earth. All right,

48
00:07:55,449 --> 00:08:03,449
let's go. I think there's something else you can do here. There's something else on booster's

49
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:07,610
path that I don't want to miss. It is like a training course, but is it over here? Where is

50
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:21,560
it? This is that way, but I can't keep going that way. I forget where it is. You have to

51
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:27,879
scale a mountain. Let me check that over here one more time. I think, let me follow up the other

52
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:46,500
side. Like this. Nope. Hey Jerm, I was watching your last stream. Could you maybe cut back on

53
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:54,179
the ha ha entertainer joke? Please laugh. Jokes, please. Then you what? Ha ha entertainer jokes?

54
00:08:54,179 --> 00:09:07,000
Laugh, please laugh jokes? What the fuck does that mean? I don't even know what that means.

55
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:19,820
The laugh, please laugh jokes. I don't know what the fuck that means. All right. What was

56
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:33,529
the last thing I just did? Let me try to remember. We got the princess. Oh, we got to talk to the

57
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:50,700
frog fusions. Okay. Oh, let me check from frog coins. May I help you? Uh, no. Where's the frog

58
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:56,299
coin guy? Welcome to the frog coin emporium. I got 15 frog coins. I'm not going to use any of these

59
00:09:57,419 --> 00:10:00,940
because you can get accessories later that are really, really good. Hold on. Let's see if

60
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:12,279
Todofsky has anything. My favorite song is the Bolville Miner's song. Oh, me do so. I have a

61
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:25,740
picture. This is my phone. I'm going to get the next layer of card. Me do so do re la ti do.

62
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:39,259
All right, let's get that up. Where is it? Remind chat of September. What is that? What the hell is

63
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:52,809
September? I think I have to take a photo of this. Me do so do. Whatever that is. To me,

64
00:10:52,809 --> 00:11:01,450
this is the me do so do re la ti do is more important. Hold on. Me do so do re la ti do.

65
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:09,960
When are you ever going to do an experimental no talking stream?

66
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:16,600
A hundred of you would watch that. I'm not going to do that. All right. Me do so do re la ti do.

67
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:24,279
Got it? And then I have the image there. Let's do it. Okay, September. It's half off of all subs.

68
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:39,340
Really? Oh, all right. Okay. What do you mean half off? How does it make sense? What the

69
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:48,299
fuck was that? What the hell is that? My phone just like did a different noise. It's never done

70
00:11:48,299 --> 00:12:04,809
this noise. All right. No, that's good. All right. So you want a music lesson from me? No, I don't.

71
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:10,629
All right. I got it. Oh no, I'm supposed to keep my phone open. Did my phone overheat because I had

72
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:16,230
the image on for too long? This is the third year it's happened. How do you not know this?

73
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:20,870
I don't know because it's only like one month out of a year three times. This only happened three

74
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:33,110
times. Look. Me do so do re la ti do is more important. Please laugh at that. All right.

75
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:42,820
Do re mi. This is the last one. Okay. Me do which is right in the middle.

76
00:12:43,539 --> 00:13:19,220
Me do so. So it's do do ti la so fa do re la so that's do ti la so fa do ti la do do ti

77
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:26,820
do. All right. This is it. What do you think, Todofsky? I did a pretty good job. I think.

78
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,830
Hey man, did you have a mental breakdown? A long time ago you said you'd only play this on stream

79
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:52,870
if you had a mental breakdown. Did I actually say that? I got a tenner card. Wait, why did I

80
00:13:52,870 --> 00:14:07,830
say that? I said I would only play this game if I had a mental breakdown on stream? Well,

81
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:14,649
yeah, you can count Simpsons hit and run. That makes sense. Yeah, nothing wrong with that.

82
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:21,769
All right. I got my card. We have the next level of stolen music from this guy.

83
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:34,820
All right. Mario tennis counts. No, I'm okay with that. A tenner card holder, huh? What'll it be?

84
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:43,350
Oh, we get mega elixirs now. The whole party recovers 150. That's a lot of money.

85
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:54,500
All right. Let's go talk to Frogfuture so I'm ready for one of my distinct voices.

86
00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:13,289
I have the latest news, children. A large star has been sighted on Star Hill. In other news,

87
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:44,220
the sky is fucking blue. Why are you coming to me? Sorry, Grandpa. Here we go. Star Hill.

88
00:15:45,019 --> 00:16:00,440
This place is cool. I get a lot of claymation vibes from this place. To marry more and then

89
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,840
talk to the flower and the flower, if you talk to the flower, a gate will open. This one is to Star

90
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:21,210
Hill. Here we go. I still haven't figured out how I want him to sound. I have to figure it out now

91
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:31,509
because we're getting to the top of the roller coaster here. This is Star Hill. No. Watch out

92
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:40,230
for the lizard behind you. Behind you. This is Star Hill. No, that sounds terrible. This is Star

93
00:16:40,230 --> 00:17:01,860
Hill. No, this is Star Hill. No, this is Star Hill. No, this, this, this, this, this is Star Hill.

94
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:09,670
Wishes which were transformed at the Star Road fall from here, but some wishes that haven't

95
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:17,980
been granted yet are falling because Smitty destroyed the Star Road. I have to do the anime

96
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:34,140
voice. What else am I supposed to do? I'm combining them all for that character. You're

97
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:51,079
getting all five in that character alone. Oh, it's Otto. No, I don't want to hurt Otto. Just these

98
00:17:51,079 --> 00:18:13,349
things. Migraine. I think Migraine is an instant kill. Just do text to speech. That's, all right,

99
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:27,670
why do we have to, that did one damage and I didn't even block it. That's not very nice. These little

100
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:30,789
guys though, I do want to attack because I think they give you stuff. They drop stuff.

101
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:39,430
Say the same thing twice. I think I actually kind of like this Virginia. Yeah, I'm going to stick

102
00:18:39,430 --> 00:19:06,420
with this one. No, don't let them run. Don't let them get away. These guys drop items. 30 bucks.

103
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:19,880
That's what I'm talking about. Go all the way around, touch this one.

104
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:29,029
What about the little star? Look at that emote. That is such a cute little emote, isn't it?

105
00:19:29,829 --> 00:19:40,789
If I could just get that melody. If you could just get the melody.

106
00:19:44,250 --> 00:20:01,849
The hunger. Oh, for some food. Not creepy. What do stars eat? I want to be evolved class Baker.

107
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:08,980
Have you figured it out yet? Have you figured it out yet, class?

108
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:25,430
I want to be the best treasure hunter in the world. Yes, these are wishes from the people down below.

109
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:51,750
Did it really take? Come on. Figured it out. I got it. I want to be the best treasure. Who's the

110
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:59,779
best? Who is that? I'm not even sure who that's supposed to be. I wonder what character that is.

111
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:13,109
The hunger. That's probably, that's, uh, Valom. What's my wish? Um, I can't tell you because then

112
00:21:13,109 --> 00:21:27,910
it won't come true. Where's this other stupid flower? Please let Malo find his way home.

113
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:40,490
Why, this wish is, wait, wait, this wish is, it's from my mom and dad. They're wishing for me to come

114
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:56,759
home. This is not the time to be crying. They're waiting for me to come home. Come on, Mario. We've

115
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:07,220
got a busy schedule. I'll make you eat dust if you don't hurry. What? Is that what he said? What did

116
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:31,980
he say? Did I say that wrong? Is dust like dirt? Like berry? I'm going to make you eat dust. Who's

117
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:59,609
this one? Wish I could run faster. I hope I become famous. It's mine. Shh, don't tell anybody. So

118
00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:05,049
the one problem with Mario, this is the only issue that most people have with this game, is this is

119
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:13,910
just a free star. You don't have to do anything. This is kind of the padding. This is the filler

120
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:29,640
episode of this game. It is a cool stage though. Yeah, it is. Hey, look at that. Only three more

121
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:46,460
to go. And one could say this is the end of the, yeah, the merry more arc. You've come a long way,

122
00:23:46,460 --> 00:24:00,779
but your journey is not over. There are three more star pieces. We're good. I want to be a great

123
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:18,119
plumber like my brother Mario. Luigi, I'm sorry, but you'll never be as good as me. You'll always

124
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:35,750
be second best. I'm just being realistic. You know, come on. Luigi, how many games have you had?

125
00:24:36,869 --> 00:24:46,250
One, two. I've had like 38. You need to have 36 more games under your belt before you're going

126
00:24:46,250 --> 00:25:01,980
to be able to fix his toilets like I can. What's going on here? Apologize. I'm sorry, Luigi. There.

127
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:29,690
That's a family guy joke? How is that a family guy joke? I'm just a customer. Don't tell me

128
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:44,259
you want supplies. I know. Wait, I made fun of Luigi, therefore I was a family guy joke?

129
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:52,539
No, I didn't know how the rules were. I'm sorry. All right, bad mush poisons an enemy,

130
00:25:53,750 --> 00:26:05,690
a Muku cookie, Fright Bomb, Fire Bomb, and Ice Bomb. These are really good, but they're way too

131
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:20,940
expensive. Ice Bomb is crazy. I think it does like over two or three hundred damage. I don't know

132
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:41,480
what this does. You owe us a Peter. No, I don't. At all, actually. So thank you very much. In the

133
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:53,259
middle of the ocean is a pirate ship. You'll find, I mean, there's a pirate lives there. His name

134
00:26:53,900 --> 00:27:08,059
is Jonathan Jones. He isn't very nice. A star has fallen into the sea. The pirate, probably.

135
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:37,140
I mean, that man, Jonathan Jones, probably has it. He's nasty. This is the inn. You may stay for free.

136
00:27:39,779 --> 00:28:30,309
Thanks. Okay. I'm scared. Check your money. You may stay for free. Outpass. Okay. Wait,

137
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:48,710
this one already. It's like a cat. Kavir, you're collecting stars, right? Only three more to go.

138
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:12,009
If you want to enter the ocean, jump into the whirlpools. You will find the village elder

139
00:29:12,009 --> 00:30:05,609
in his house. He is the most respected person here. I'm spinning. I'm spinning. Finally, it took you

140
00:30:05,609 --> 00:30:12,740
long enough. I am the elder of this village. I got to my exalted station in life by

141
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:22,150
pleasing my superiors, which is something I do well. A star has fallen into the ocean. I need it

142
00:30:23,099 --> 00:30:36,470
for a certain purpose. You must find it for me. You'll find the star in Jonathan Jones' territory.

143
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:44,259
Don't worry. You can beat him. At least I think you can. Hurry and bring back the star.

144
00:30:55,609 --> 00:31:02,490
Hello there. You're Mario, right? You remember me? We met at Tadpole Pond, but I'm still at Tadpole.

145
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:07,380
I've graduated from Frogfusious's school, and now I'm searching for the meaning of life.

146
00:31:08,259 --> 00:31:16,950
It's been so quiet around here. It's almost eerie. Is something going on? It probably doesn't

147
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:34,950
concern me. Well, if you got any frog coins, I've got some neat items to sell you. There we go.

148
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:41,930
Doubles experience when equipped, doubles the coins you win in battle, and cuts FP use in half

149
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:49,180
during a fight. This also is you can use this to start a fight over or allows you to always run

150
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:57,450
away from a battle. This one is awesome. This one is probably this is the probably best ring in the

151
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:10,500
game, but it's 50 frog coins. Realistically, I could probably get one of these. I definitely

152
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:19,220
don't want to do this, though. Go farm the Midas River. I could, but I don't think I'm gonna do

153
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:28,660
that. It's a cool character, though. Be careful up here, by the way. Do you have like a stick or

154
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:40,259
something? Can I give you like a symbol? These people here are dangerous. Look at them. Oops.

155
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:53,509
I think I can get in there eventually. All right, I think I'm good. I have the latest equipment. What

156
00:32:53,509 --> 00:33:02,789
do I have for items? I have too many honey syrups. All right, I'm gonna use these as well. All

157
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:07,750
right, I gotta do some, I gotta, I gotta, I have to get rid of this shit. I need some mushrooms.

158
00:33:08,549 --> 00:33:13,849
How many mushrooms do I have? I need more stuff. Hold on. I'm gonna have to go to the town and get

159
00:33:13,849 --> 00:33:26,890
some stuff because these guys won't sell me shit. I do have so much stuff, but I just need to get

160
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:39,640
rid of it. No, who sells you? No, who sells? You sell. Bad mushroom? No, I have to go to a different

161
00:33:39,640 --> 00:34:00,170
town. There was a Super Mario manga for a bit. Was there really? That seems weird. All right,

162
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:08,809
let's get some stuff. Uh, Wart Club, we already have everything that's the best. I need some mid

163
00:34:08,809 --> 00:34:14,329
mushrooms, though. And I'm gonna sell, I have to sell them. They're taking up so much stupid space.

164
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:22,570
Honey syrups are just dog shit now. I could get, I could, look at how much you could get for that.

165
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:40,699
Bucky Jewel, I know I could use that and I could, uh, I had to. These, these are, oh shit, panic

166
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:46,949
buttons. I still have a Yoshi cookie. All right, I'm gonna get another, I'm gonna get a maple syrup.

167
00:34:47,750 --> 00:35:02,199
Yeah, two maple syrups. That sounds good to me. Whatever happens happens. I should be fine. Let's

168
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:15,369
go to the sea. This is time to go find the star that's apparently down here. Oh, there he is.

169
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:30,550
It's been a while since people came around here. Oh fuck, look at all this. I don't have any money.

170
00:35:33,429 --> 00:35:47,289
Super hammer, pearly gloves, handgun I already have. Oh no, how much can I get if I take off?

171
00:35:47,289 --> 00:36:03,130
Hold on. All right, if I, if I get rid of the happy shirt, get rid of the happy cape, keep the

172
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:10,679
amulet. The work pants are always good. What if I get rid of the jump shoes? All right, I'm gonna

173
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:14,739
sell those two and see if I can afford any of them. I'll be able to come back and afford it later.

174
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:26,860
Happy shirt, happy cape, buy sailor shirt, sailor cape. All right, we can get Mario's shirt.

175
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:40,940
I'm not gonna have to come back for Gino's shirt. The ship sank into the briny sea because a giant

176
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:53,179
squid attacked it. Some people went in to survey it, but they never came back. Weird. Sailor shirt.

177
00:36:53,739 --> 00:37:08,969
All right, you'll be fine. Giant octopus. Never came back. I'll come back. This is,

178
00:37:08,969 --> 00:37:12,969
I believe there is a star right here, so I've got to be ready for this.

179
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:36,980
More, more, more, more, more. Oh, Mario's level nine. You know what to do. This is in your hands.

180
00:37:43,460 --> 00:38:01,909
Please click on the screen where you'd like me to put the points in. Have fun with it. Power,

181
00:38:01,909 --> 00:38:28,010
power, power, power, power. Okay, I think that's all I need to see. Power it is. 55 to 57 and then

182
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:39,750
27 to 28 defense. What am I gonna do? We got another one. Gino. Gino got a good HP increase.

183
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:56,809
Yeah, very good. Pretty much crossed the board, everything. Choose wisely. A continuous speedrun

184
00:38:56,809 --> 00:39:04,019
the next day is against the rules. All right, guys, that's it for tonight. I'll see you tomorrow

185
00:39:04,019 --> 00:39:18,760
where I pick up at 42 minutes and 12 seconds. That's funny. All right, uh, we're going with

186
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:32,309
Magic. 40, 41, 24, 25. Anybody else? Wow, I think the whole, uh, the whole entire group leveled up,

187
00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:42,650
I believe. Malo's creeping up on Gino, but look at his HP. It's terrible. He'll get one hit killed

188
00:39:42,650 --> 00:40:06,730
and half the encounters late game. Potentially a decent choice. I do love the dancing flowers,

189
00:40:10,969 --> 00:40:22,659
though. What's the actual meta for this game? I have no idea. Not a single group. Guys, I just

190
00:40:22,659 --> 00:40:26,739
press buttons. I don't know what they do. I'm actually surprised I've been able to do this with

191
00:40:26,739 --> 00:40:45,239
my eyes closed for this long. Toadstool has reached level 10. Look at that magic. Gino, Toadstool,

192
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:53,480
and Malo, I believe, have the highest damage for Magic. Why am I not playing Classic? Wow,

193
00:40:53,480 --> 00:41:00,469
I have Warf- I have Warf- I have reference, not Warference. I have reference Warcraft every stream.

194
00:41:10,329 --> 00:41:18,230
Because I- I don't know. I'm not playing it. Maybe I will. Guys, you never go

195
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:26,739
to the new attraction the day it opens. I don't want to wait in line for four hours

196
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:33,369
to ride the new Galaxy's Edge ride. I'm gonna go when everybody doesn't give a shit anymore,

197
00:41:33,369 --> 00:41:38,090
and I can stay in the hotel for fucking three nights for the same price as one night right now.

198
00:41:38,730 --> 00:42:03,510
Thank you for voting. 45 and 31. You're gonna stay in the hotel when it's not cool anymore.

199
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:07,670
Yeah, it's- what do you mean it's not cool anymore? It's cool to like me, my two sons,

200
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:15,590
my wife, and our gran- and my grandfather. Well, I don't care. I don't give a shit how- how cool

201
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:29,300
it is. It's cool to us. Found the secret room, by the way. I- hold on. Important. I'm about to get

202
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:39,579
destroyed. I do. Oh no no no no no no no no no what did I do? What did I do? What did I do?

203
00:42:41,289 --> 00:42:52,119
No shit. No I got baited. I got baited. I wasn't supposed to do this. No. And I just saved it

204
00:42:52,119 --> 00:43:15,619
right here. It's the only save I have. Did I get- how much money did I make? Not enough. Thank you,

205
00:43:15,619 --> 00:43:23,989
drop by again. All right, I'm- that wasn't as bad as I thought it was gonna be. In fact, that was

206
00:43:23,989 --> 00:43:29,909
not a big deal at all. I just overreacted. I reacted harder for you, okay? That was a lot of

207
00:43:29,909 --> 00:43:37,510
reactions. The reason why I did that is because over here, there is one of these things that-

208
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:43,829
never mind. I had it incorrect. I was wrong, and I will stand by my correction that I did- I thought

209
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:59,289
it was a different part of the game. It was just some free stuff, and that's it. But I want to get

210
00:43:59,289 --> 00:44:08,980
up there. Oh, I get there. I know you can like get sucked up there somehow. I didn't want to do that

211
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:25,449
either. Yes I did. I want to come up. Got a max mushroom. Let's get rid of one of our honey syrups

212
00:44:26,489 --> 00:44:40,260
because these things are stupid. Should I fight it? Hold on. I think there's stuff over here.

213
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:50,730
Isn't there something here? I always thought there was something over here. This- I- I remember this

214
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:56,179
part. This part sucks because you can only breathe- you can only be underwater for 30 seconds before

215
00:44:56,179 --> 00:44:59,460
you start to drown. So you have to keep- there's like oxygen pockets and shit.

216
00:45:01,659 --> 00:45:06,300
I'm just kidding. There's a page from the travelogue. Let's take a look. It looks boring.

217
00:45:07,989 --> 00:45:16,469
Here's the thing. I know the password already. I've known the password for 15 years. So there's a

218
00:45:16,469 --> 00:45:22,630
password. I don't even need to know any of these things. We've managed to trap the giant squid in

219
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:27,429
the treasure cellar. The treasure will sink with the ship, but so it goes. There's a big password

220
00:45:27,429 --> 00:45:31,349
you have to figure out. I already know what it is. So I'm sorry to all the people that are like

221
00:45:31,349 --> 00:45:35,750
waiting for me to deduce this password. It took me a while to figure this out when I was 12,

222
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:41,900
but ever since then it's been burned in my brain. I don't need to do anything else. I'm more- well

223
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:45,579
we'll just- we'll just- I'll just pretend, right? We'll do- I'm gonna do like a YouTube let's play

224
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:55,659
here. What are you done for? A giant squid's got a hold of us. The ship's going down fast.

225
00:45:57,719 --> 00:46:00,199
No, I gotta save that one. I gotta save that voice for the actual pirate.

226
00:46:00,679 --> 00:46:11,190
The door to the cellar is locked with a password consisting of six letters. In order to proceed,

227
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:19,179
you'll have to decipher the password using the six hints. By the way, the password is pearls.

228
00:46:19,179 --> 00:46:32,409
I win. Oh fuck, this must be a YouTube let's play. Sorry guys. Uncover the secret of the six hints,

229
00:46:32,409 --> 00:46:37,449
of course, since they're provided by different people. That'd be pretty tough to solve. Maybe

230
00:46:37,449 --> 00:46:54,340
even impossible. Mm-hmm, little secret. He's bad at tubing. I don't think he can be good at tubing.

231
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:04,739
You just lie down on it and jump into the snow and then you scream and just pray. Okay, um,

232
00:47:05,619 --> 00:47:37,460
let's go. They're scared. Willy wisp. 40 fucking damage. See, Malo would be dead.

233
00:47:38,260 --> 00:48:03,050
He would really only take one of those and then be gone. Damn, he was dead. This guy sucks.

234
00:48:08,789 --> 00:48:19,349
Ooh, Bowser level 10. Pretty good increases all around. Oh, Gino doesn't have any armor on. Oh yeah,

235
00:48:19,349 --> 00:48:24,630
that's right. Oh right, you're right. You are right. Completely correct on that. Gino is not wearing

236
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:31,860
armor. Um, I have to go back and buy the sailor cape. Thank you for reminding me, but I can't

237
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:58,650
afford it yet. Who gives the most money? Wow, 76% of you guys. Really? That's, I mean, yeah, I guess.

238
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:05,449
He is really strong. There's a problem here though. Um, two of the people in this current party,

239
00:49:06,329 --> 00:49:16,250
you're only giving power to. Mario and Bowser have not great HP and not good magic damage or defense.

240
00:49:16,809 --> 00:49:25,099
Only Gino does. So, and Gino is not wearing armor. You guys might have screwed this all up. I'm just

241
00:49:25,099 --> 00:49:44,199
saying. Here we go. Coins. How much money do I have now? 136. I need like 200, 300.

242
00:49:44,760 --> 00:50:16,090
Ah, let's just get this over with. Didn't kill them. How? Shit. Come on. How are you doing less

243
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:27,159
damage than Gino? This motherfucker is naked. Here's a Gino again. Bye. He's dead. He has one health.

244
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:46,010
He'll be fine. Look, 110 damage. These guys have a lot of armor too. Once again, that's fine. Run

245
00:50:46,010 --> 00:51:11,849
away. I'm looking for about 200 coins. That's three. That's not 200. Shit. Oh, shit. Oh, okay.

246
00:51:11,849 --> 00:51:46,570
I gotta actually stop fucking around. Got it. No. Oh, don't do it again. Not on Mario. No.

247
00:51:49,349 --> 00:51:56,869
Mario sucks. Laughing my ass off. No, Mario did this very good. Done. Good. Once again,

248
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:01,500
I'll take Lucky because that might be coins and you guys will pick. I promise.

249
00:52:01,659 --> 00:52:20,500
16 damage on a block. What the hell are you talking about? What the fuck just happened?

250
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:30,309
He's got no armor. He doesn't have any fucking clothes on. Oh, everything's fine. Don't run.

251
00:52:30,309 --> 00:52:53,610
100. There we go. Okay. So we've got six coins. Chance to double your coins. Let's do it. You're

252
00:52:53,610 --> 00:53:01,750
ready? Give it all you got. Follow it. Okay. Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me.

253
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:07,670
Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me. Why am I not using the scan line filters? Because they make

254
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:33,000
me throw up. That's a pretty big amount. That's a 47% think it's over here. I really hope the

255
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:39,320
14% of you that clicked on G-Node actually that you didn't know where it was because that's a lot

256
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:46,440
of percentages. So here we go. Let's do it. You guys say the left and you are correct.

257
00:53:47,239 --> 00:53:54,679
That is 12 coins. 15 EXP. No, I wanted to get away so I could heal. Okay. This is bad.

258
00:53:55,559 --> 00:54:03,800
This is really bad. Give me a chance. Gino has no fucking armor on. Okay. Basu, you have to stay

259
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:49,699
alive. Run. Actually run away. You got away. Good. Oh my shit. That was fucking lucky. Okay.

260
00:54:49,699 --> 00:55:06,139
All right. Now let's go back and get Gino's outfit. It's going to be 300 something damage.

261
00:55:07,019 --> 00:55:18,230
No. These guys take a lot of damage. But they obviously are very hard to kill. Time that wrong.

262
00:55:29,429 --> 00:55:32,949
No, I forgot. You have to kill them with magic. I remember now.

263
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:49,420
I remember. Yep. They only die from magic. Go on Mario. Go ahead. Gino sucks.

264
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:53,980
No, he doesn't have any. He's not wearing any armor. That's why he's not very good.

265
00:55:54,860 --> 00:56:07,480
Okay. Let's go back to the merchant and let's get what we need to get.

266
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:24,340
This is who you guys want in Smash. Yes. And I turned my head slightly over my shoulder a little

267
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:31,860
and my face is bright red. Yes. Like I am embarrassed that he's being he's doing not doing so well.

268
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:51,619
Okay. Sailor cape. I have the sailor shirt. I now want the hurly gloves. This is for Bowser.

269
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:57,099
I already got the handgun. Super hammer is the super hammer. Hurly gloves are better.

270
00:56:57,739 --> 00:57:06,170
Are they than the chomp? I don't remember. I think they are. We'll find out. Hurly gloves. Oh yeah.

271
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:22,309
They are sailor cape. Finally Gino won't die instantly. Okay. So I'm going to sell the chomp

272
00:57:22,309 --> 00:57:29,030
and I'm going to get the how much is this? 107. You guys are going to love the hurly gloves.

273
00:57:29,829 --> 00:57:41,699
Oh nice. Is the super hammer as good as the masher or worse? I don't remember.

274
00:57:47,829 --> 00:58:09,030
I'm going to find out. Damn it. It is worse than the masher. Okay. All right. Now I'm going to

275
00:58:09,909 --> 00:58:16,230
pick me ups. Get another one. Get another one. Sell items. In fact, you know what? No, no, no,

276
00:58:16,469 --> 00:58:22,630
take it. Take it. Use the flower jar like for the love of God. What are you? That stupid, stupid

277
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:35,769
idiot. Jeremy, what are you? Dumb person. I need to use this during a boss fight. If I use this

278
00:58:35,769 --> 00:58:40,730
during a boss fight, it guarantees a luck. It guarantees one of those, uh, the three eggs of

279
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:45,849
Yoshi. It's going to be a lot on the line. So if I use this at a boss fight, I hope you guys are

280
00:58:45,849 --> 00:58:55,510
ready to really truly try and pick the right one. That leaves me room to do a couple more mid mushrooms.

281
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:11,429
I have to trust you guys. I do. Let's do two more mid mushrooms. I'm going to pick Gino.

282
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:44,780
All right. I can leave. No, I can't leave. I just know I can. I didn't ban anybody. I just sucked

283
00:59:44,780 --> 01:00:00,070
up all their messages in a vacuum cleaner. They're still here. All right. Check this out.

284
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:26,219
Want something funny? I love freaking out my new guests with that one. Those of you guys that are

285
01:00:26,219 --> 01:00:30,300
new to the stream, ah, you probably were like, what the fuck? Man, this stream is awesome.

286
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:50,280
I love freaking out new guests. Actually. Okay. Lucky. There it is. I'm going to do this one.

287
01:00:51,000 --> 01:01:07,019
Is that what we are? We're guests. Could be. I wasn't prepared for it. Okay. That can kill

288
01:01:07,019 --> 01:01:16,440
you. Is that the variety? And now he throws out the little, the action figure. 19 and eight,

289
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:29,110
double the coins. I can handle this one. I'll get this one, but I do need to heal.

290
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:52,820
Oh, I don't need to do it to Bowser. He'll be fine. Bowser can handle it. Okay. So let's go.

291
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:57,190
Everybody has their gear. I got there. All this stuff that they need.

292
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:10,420
Damn it. I tried to jump the whole thing. I need this though, because otherwise I'm going to get

293
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:16,980
slammed dunked on. This is going to be interesting. What happens here?

294
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:22,809
Yeah. Aren't you glad that Mario has no magic defense? Cause he's almost dead.

295
01:02:23,449 --> 01:02:40,420
Are you guys glad you clicked on power? 12 times? 10 times? That was the plan.

296
01:02:41,619 --> 01:03:13,320
How did I miss everybody? Oh, come on. Go to the back. If we didn't click health once,

297
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:33,320
you'd have the strength to do this. I'm good. I'm lucky. Do the spee voice. I don't remember how.

298
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:45,940
Experience. This is important. I have no idea. Help me. This is for like 30 EXP. That's pretty

299
01:03:45,940 --> 01:04:35,349
good. One versus 100. All right. So, uh, how do I get this one? Like that. Memo left by Magellan.

300
01:04:35,349 --> 01:04:41,349
There's an S in the word. I can skip this whole thing by the way. I already, I know.

301
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:59,369
I know though. I know the whole thing. That's not cheating. Okay. If you study for your math test

302
01:04:59,369 --> 01:05:10,679
and you know the math problems, are you cheating on your math test? I'm sorry. I didn't know.

303
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:26,619
Second try. I am going to do this for the flower tabs though.

304
01:05:28,019 --> 01:05:31,539
It is found on the bed of the ocean and it has an S. It is a Pearls.

305
01:05:32,659 --> 01:05:38,380
Now let's just, you know, let's level up a little. It's going to be a tough fight.

306
01:05:38,380 --> 01:06:00,280
Those are the most dangerous. Probably the Grim Reaper. Not messing around.

307
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:34,250
Fuck. And I wish I had a Lucky right here. That was, that's pretty good actually.

308
01:06:35,210 --> 01:06:39,820
All right. I want the flower tabs. This is a three-dimensional maze.

309
01:06:40,900 --> 01:07:06,579
Press X if you give up. I'm just feeling on the walls.

310
01:07:12,010 --> 01:08:10,380
What? No, go back over here. Over that. Up on this. Come out this door. I can't, I don't know

311
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:55,430
how to do it. I can't move anywhere. I got nowhere to go. Am I even up a level? I'm stuck. I think

312
01:08:55,430 --> 01:09:24,090
I'm actually stuck up here. I'm pressing up, down. I'm trying to move. Am I there? Where am I?

313
01:09:37,989 --> 01:09:44,729
I can get like up here somewhere. Okay. I can't go up left. I can go left,

314
01:09:45,369 --> 01:09:52,140
but that brings me all the way down here. Can I go right from here? Okay. Can I go up from here?

315
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:57,479
Can I go down from here? Can I go left from here? Can I go up from here? Can I go,

316
01:09:57,479 --> 01:10:22,470
can I go down from here? Okay. Up. Left. Right. Jump. Okay. Right. Up. Jump. Right. Jump.

317
01:10:23,529 --> 01:10:32,649
Down. Jump. Right. Jump. Down. Jump. Right. Jump. Down. Jump. Right. Jump. Up. Jump.

318
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:48,199
Left. Jump. Up. Jump. Down. Right. Up. There's like something blocking me here.

319
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:54,649
Okay. Oh, fuck. Up. Fuck am I? Come on, Mario. Get over here. Ooh. Ooh. All right.

320
01:11:54,649 --> 01:12:05,779
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for viewing. There's two vowels. This is royal syrup. I will

321
01:12:05,779 --> 01:12:29,609
place a honey syrup. I'm out. Got it. Can't jump down. That's fine. Oh, there's the uh,

322
01:12:29,609 --> 01:12:38,300
this is the guy that sells stuff. Hey, it's good to see you. If only I had known that. I forgot

323
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:45,829
that you were here. I want. I got pretty much everything I need. I'll give you a hint. The

324
01:12:45,829 --> 01:12:53,260
password has something to do with the sea. Even if you don't get through all six of the obstacles,

325
01:12:53,260 --> 01:13:07,449
you would try to deduce your way through. Good luck. Can I jump over you? I think I can. No,

326
01:13:07,449 --> 01:13:23,189
I can't. Just fight him. Uh, let's do. This is actually kind of a big fight. Come on, Mario.

327
01:13:23,189 --> 01:14:20,810
Got them all. Boom. Boom. Yes. That was a big hit. Lucky. You can't stay awake. I can help. This

328
01:14:20,810 --> 01:14:37,739
is only for that person. So everybody else mute. I'm gonna give you three seconds. I just have a

329
01:14:37,739 --> 01:15:01,800
chalkboard back here and I just scraped. Okay. Tell everybody they can unmute. Yeah, you can

330
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:21,050
unmute. All right. Pick. No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Not yet. Can you do that but

331
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:27,850
louder? No. It's as loud as you're ever gonna get. That was just enough of a weird sound to

332
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:59,579
have somebody go, what the fuck was that? All right. Now pick please. Super lame. Going for power

333
01:15:59,579 --> 01:16:10,659
again. He's screaming. I'm just sitting here going like, I don't, I wouldn't want to miss that, to

334
01:16:10,659 --> 01:16:23,670
be honest. I just blow up my vocal cords screaming as loud as I can. I can't do that. If I were to

335
01:16:23,670 --> 01:16:28,380
do that, if I were to scream as loud as I fucking can, I would have to stop screaming. It would be

336
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:41,050
over. I would sound like this for the rest of the entire day and it would hurt. I don't know how

337
01:16:41,050 --> 01:17:06,140
people scream because they're angry. I guess that's true. Wait a minute. Are you guys actually

338
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:27,220
clicking on HP? I'm very interested in this. Okay. Thank you. 89. Mallow didn't even have to do

339
01:17:27,220 --> 01:18:09,720
anything in these level. Mallow learns shocker. Super. End of career. End of career voice.

340
01:18:10,439 --> 01:18:25,300
Playing Sekiro. What? Hold on. I need to hear this. This is important. I need to know what the fuck

341
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:47,289
this is. End of career? What did I do? I just want to hear it. Um, I don't know. I can't think of

342
01:18:47,289 --> 01:18:59,640
anybody. Mark Simpson. Homer. No, that's going to fix it. Homer. Holy shit. It's Joan Rivers.

343
01:19:00,359 --> 01:19:05,399
Oh, Joan Rivers. Absolutely. It's unbelievable. Oh darling, you look so beautiful right now on

344
01:19:05,399 --> 01:19:10,760
the runway. Let me tell you something about just how I forgot about the fuck. I forgot. Fuck it.

345
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:15,880
Let's go. I can't fix it. I think I have this voice forever. I have this voice forever. I fucked

346
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:21,270
it up. I coughed too much and now it's over. I actually have this voice forever. This is it.

347
01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:34,680
My career is over. Oh my God. My career is over. I have to turn it to Larry the cable guy. Oh no.

348
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:44,729
Hold on. I'll be back. I actually remember this because I remember I started doing like Bernie

349
01:19:44,729 --> 01:19:50,819
Sanders and Larry David and shit. That was crazy though. Damn. Good thing I recovered.

350
01:19:54,819 --> 01:20:08,300
What did you guys pick? You picked this one. Crazy. Haha. Damn. It's a good thing that you...

351
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:20,260
No, I don't smoke. I don't smoke. Quit spreading rumors about me. 49. Does he have the highest?

352
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:43,079
He might. Fuck. Oh, it's a bunch of coins. Damn it. Okay. Crystal. And how do you have

353
01:20:43,079 --> 01:21:07,590
that clip just ready to go? Daryl slaps himself. That is the worst clip ever. That's seriously the

354
01:21:07,590 --> 01:21:31,180
worst clip that's ever been recorded on this stream. It has to be. It has to be. How do you

355
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:54,439
slap yourself? I... very carefully. Bone gutted. What the fuck? All right. Peach is level 11.

356
01:21:55,239 --> 01:22:03,340
She will have the highest magic attack of the whole group, I believe. And she learns sleepy time.

357
01:22:06,359 --> 01:22:18,149
Give me something to work with here. We're gonna have to make a pretty

358
01:22:19,109 --> 01:22:26,229
major decision soon as to what we want to make our final party look like.

359
01:22:27,029 --> 01:22:34,619
Is it gonna be Peach, Mario, and Bowser? Is it gonna be Peach, Mario, and Mallow? Is it gonna be

360
01:22:34,619 --> 01:22:48,060
Geno, Mario, and Mallow? Is it gonna be Geno, Toadstool, and Bowser? Come on. I can see something

361
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:53,659
with the extension not installed and you're not clicking. This is... we're at 43, 42. Come on.

362
01:22:54,460 --> 01:23:14,359
Thank you. I'm so sorry. All right. It's gonna be HP. Thank you for voting. Three, two, one.

363
01:23:14,359 --> 01:23:21,670
But that actually helps a lot. All right. Now do I have enough money to pay for something?

364
01:23:22,229 --> 01:23:29,770
Let's see. Let me see. We got six. Pick me up seven maple syrups. That's a lot of maple

365
01:23:29,770 --> 01:23:54,279
syrups I probably don't need. Okay. Just chop up. I want the stuff that's in here. There's a screw

366
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:59,560
that's getting really loose on my chair. And I could probably really easily screw it in.

367
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:06,520
And I think it's one of those scenarios where it's a very major, like, construction part of

368
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:17,060
this chair. And if it goes, the whole chair might just break underneath me. I'll be fine.

369
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:43,819
Floating coins? It's a load-bearing screw. I can farm coins here though, can't I?

370
01:24:46,489 --> 01:25:33,029
No. Ah. No. What the fuck? No. What? I'm actually mad about this. How am I not touching this one?

371
01:25:33,029 --> 01:26:17,449
What the hell are you doing? I thought I was gonna turn to something else.

372
01:26:17,449 --> 01:26:44,329
You guys realize I never did these because I knew it was pearls. Why is that so hard? No,

373
01:26:44,329 --> 01:26:48,890
but I thought I had to keep up with it. I never did that one. Half of these I didn't do because

374
01:26:48,890 --> 01:26:51,930
I knew it was pearls. So I didn't do them. I've never walked in these fucking rooms.

375
01:26:58,149 --> 01:27:15,109
That's the first time I've ever been in that room. I knew someone was gonna say it. I was

376
01:27:15,109 --> 01:27:20,869
waiting for someone to say sans. Every time this character pops up, I look over the chat and I

377
01:27:20,869 --> 01:27:28,069
don't see it. And I'm like, really? No one has said it yet. I knew it was gonna happen. I was

378
01:27:28,069 --> 01:27:42,300
waiting. Okay, those are the really big fans of Undertale and Sans. If Sans was in Smash Brothers,

379
01:27:43,020 --> 01:28:03,529
Sans from Undertale was in Smash Brothers, but he was $150. Would you buy it? I'd be tempted.

380
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:21,079
He's not in a pass. He's $149. Finally crossed 100 HP with some character. That's good.

381
01:28:36,739 --> 01:28:58,970
Nothing is too much for Sans. Would you pay that much for Gino in Smash? No, I would not. Now

382
01:28:58,970 --> 01:29:06,729
there is my public persona where I say no and there's my private in the dark in my bedroom

383
01:29:07,449 --> 01:29:12,890
when nobody can see what I'm doing. And I've got my credit card and I'm punching in the numbers

384
01:29:13,770 --> 01:29:27,050
and make sure nobody's around. And then I have Gino. You know, is that? And then who's gonna even

385
01:29:27,050 --> 01:29:43,050
know? I'll just always disconnect my switch from online. You guys pick the up. All right. Boom. I

386
01:29:43,050 --> 01:30:01,720
think I have to jump on them. I'm telling you, I've never been in these rooms. I've never been

387
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:30,890
inside of these rooms in 20 years. I think I have to move it? Yep. Ah, mushroom and it's worthless.

388
01:30:30,890 --> 01:30:41,130
At last, two consonants are side by side. At least two consonants are side by side. Oh,

389
01:30:42,010 --> 01:31:00,869
that's a stumper. Save it. And what? What? Oh, do I do this puzzle?

390
01:31:02,869 --> 01:31:09,850
Maybe I can do it from high up. Oh, it's not working.

391
01:31:20,420 --> 01:31:59,430
Mario's password is motes. The R comes before the one. Just like Portal. Yeah. All right. It's

392
01:31:59,430 --> 01:32:06,149
Pearls. Those of you guys that is your first time watching. Letter number one is P.

393
01:32:07,899 --> 01:32:23,159
Letter number two is E. A. R. L. S. The password is pearls.

394
01:32:26,220 --> 01:32:32,380
Good job. I'll let you through. If you can get past me, then we believe first, that is.

395
01:32:33,260 --> 01:33:09,180
Secret octopus battle. Whack. Oh, that hurts. Damn. Bob, so you do a ton of damage.

396
01:33:09,899 --> 01:33:33,380
Am I playing? I'm playing on an SNES. I'm playing on an SNES classic. The little mini thing.

397
01:33:43,739 --> 01:34:04,460
And if memory serves me correct, after this, there is. This is the part of the controversy that

398
01:34:05,420 --> 01:34:11,739
Nintendo had to face was that character's gone. And a lot of the reviewers were really upset

399
01:34:11,739 --> 01:34:14,300
about it. They're like, wait, what happened to my character? They never explained it.

400
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:20,970
Bowser's just gone. He's just dead. I don't know if people got upset about it and didn't

401
01:34:20,970 --> 01:34:28,569
make me stop playing here. Same joke for you. I mean, come on. I have to make every time I

402
01:34:28,569 --> 01:34:36,869
have to make that joke. I have to. It's not old material if it was less than 24 hours ago.

403
01:34:38,979 --> 01:35:00,119
This is not my, like, comedy special from 2006. This was 12 hours ago. All right, I gotta heal.

404
01:35:00,119 --> 01:35:15,800
Let's heal Gino. All right, I like to go right for the legs. So we're gonna go left leg and then

405
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:19,079
right leg and then face because these things are annoying. They do like 10 damage every hit.

406
01:35:20,260 --> 01:35:36,819
I'm not a fan of it, so I want to get rid of them. Let's, in fact, let's do super flame. 96.

407
01:35:37,619 --> 01:35:47,460
How we doing? Venom drool. Didn't really do much now, did it? Okay, let's get another...

408
01:35:47,460 --> 01:36:04,680
No, no, no, no. I need to save these. Let's do a Gino beam. Remember when you did that stand-up

409
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:14,550
set for Comedy Central in 2005? That was great. Yeah, and remember I made that joke about how...

410
01:36:14,550 --> 01:36:20,470
fuck. Remember I made that funny joke about how Super Mario RPG when Bowser gets thrown up in

411
01:36:20,470 --> 01:36:24,710
the air? How much controversy. Imagine going on stage and saying that, like, telling that.

412
01:36:24,710 --> 01:36:34,180
No one ever had any idea what you're talking about. Do I use to pick me up here or do I just

413
01:36:34,180 --> 01:37:03,500
do this without Mario? Throwing undead Mario, yeah. 132. Pretty good. Shit, I didn't get that.

414
01:37:10,340 --> 01:37:37,000
You know what? Just boost Bowser. Drain beam on all of them. Mario, your defense is so bad

415
01:37:37,079 --> 01:38:09,420
against magic. Can I replace Mario? No, no, no. That's it. I'm free. Mario might be dead here

416
01:38:09,420 --> 01:38:17,579
again. I'm doing it without Mario. He's not... he's just... he's starting into, like, some...

417
01:38:17,579 --> 01:38:26,699
he's a liability at this point. Got it. I'm so glad I did not use that pick-me-up because I'm

418
01:38:26,699 --> 01:38:43,350
gonna need it. 100 coins, 34 experience. That's pretty good. All right, let's heal up. Everybody

419
01:38:43,350 --> 01:39:02,899
is all right. Oh, everybody is. Hello? Right, go in here. Should I attack one of these? How close

420
01:39:02,899 --> 01:39:14,069
is everybody leveling up? 70, 170. All right, we're gonna... we're pretty much there. Another

421
01:39:14,069 --> 01:39:29,060
two or three battles should do it. Never mind. I'm gonna climb up here. Why did I show those stats?

422
01:39:29,060 --> 01:39:45,159
They're terrible. They're not terrible. They're fine. They're just fine. I don't like this.

423
01:40:00,630 --> 01:40:05,510
I didn't know that... that you just did so many fake outs. I don't even know which one of those is

424
01:40:05,510 --> 01:40:43,899
real. Holy shit, that's a lot of damage. Once again. Damn it. Mario. Mario. Mario, your defense is so

425
01:40:43,899 --> 01:41:10,600
bad. I should just do a two-person team at this point. 20 experience. All right, on this next

426
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:18,060
level up, we really got to figure this out. Mario is starting to become extreme weight. In fact,

427
01:41:18,060 --> 01:41:40,890
I'm gonna do this now because Mario's just not good at all. How about more power? I gotta get

428
01:41:40,890 --> 01:41:52,420
him a better item. The masher is good, but almost there. Another, like, two fights or so should do

429
01:41:52,420 --> 01:42:19,670
it. Oh, come on. Really? What are you doing back here? Once again. 57 damage. Why do I feel like

430
01:42:19,670 --> 01:42:26,840
there's something wrong with his character? Look at how much Bowser's gonna do right here. To the

431
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:56,140
mouse. 150? What's wrong with Mario? Is he all right? Ow, my face. All right, here comes the

432
01:42:56,140 --> 01:43:22,899
opportunity. It's a lot of coins. What the fuck? Which one's me? I don't know which one I am.

433
01:43:39,399 --> 01:43:54,420
Easy as fight of the night right here. Is the Spider-Man pointing at Spider-Man?

434
01:43:58,090 --> 01:44:05,050
Fuck, I fell off. There's something in here. I think there is something in here, actually.

435
01:44:05,050 --> 01:44:43,819
All right, which one am I? Karo-Karo-Kola. All right, I'm jumping out of the fucking map of

436
01:44:43,819 --> 01:45:09,510
the game. I'm going to, like, the developer. That's all, folks. Karo-Karo-Kola is amazing,

437
01:45:09,510 --> 01:45:38,539
though. Not Mario. Whatever. All right, don't. This is bad, potentially. Not quite. I'm not

438
01:45:38,539 --> 01:45:50,789
gonna use it. I can do it. We can do this together. The only threat is this thing back here.

439
01:45:51,350 --> 01:46:05,420
I'm gonna heal up with Mallow, and I'll be good to go. Actually, I'll heal from the level up.

440
01:46:05,420 --> 01:46:27,029
That's about to happen. There we go. Mario has reached level 11. Magic defense increases to 23.

441
01:46:27,750 --> 01:47:32,840
That's better. Gino Whirl. There it is. Gino Whirl can do 999 damage, if you do it right.

442
01:47:48,310 --> 01:48:11,159
This is closer, but... Hold on. Hold on. All right. That's it. That's it.

443
01:48:12,170 --> 01:48:31,340
Thank you. That's it. 52 magic attack. And there's Mallow. Magic is so strong sometimes,

444
01:48:31,340 --> 01:48:44,729
but he's so weak. His defense is 30. And when your HP is that low and your defense is that low,

445
01:48:44,729 --> 01:49:04,840
you just get hit by one thing and you immediately need to eat a whole mushroom. Not good. Right

446
01:49:04,840 --> 01:49:31,350
flower gang. Right flower. Wait, I gotta get over there. All right, everyone's been healed.

447
01:49:32,069 --> 01:49:43,989
Except for Bowser, right? No. Bowser's still... Ah! Oh, okay. I actually have to take one of these,

448
01:49:43,989 --> 01:50:09,000
so otherwise I'm gonna be in deep shit. But I have to do the magic. Oops. Bowser, come on.

449
01:50:19,420 --> 01:50:35,140
Mario did something. A little bit. Ah! That's so annoying. Because now I have to... Let's just do...

450
01:50:35,140 --> 01:50:51,460
No, Gino Whirl is 8. Gino Beam on dry bones. New weapon. New weapon. Need a new weapon for

451
01:50:51,460 --> 01:51:42,279
Mario. Bad. I need to accessorize as well. Give Mario the amulet. Yeah. He's gonna have such a

452
01:51:42,279 --> 01:51:58,220
terrible power though. Then what about, what about, what about Gino? Come on! I'm trying to get rid

453
01:51:58,220 --> 01:52:18,359
of the two in the back there and now I have to Gino Beam this dry bones. Irritating. I have to

454
01:52:18,359 --> 01:52:26,060
do something here. Like, we have to get rid of... Bump somebody. This is gonna kill it, right? Yeah.

455
01:52:26,060 --> 01:52:38,659
I mean, come on. Shit. That's not good. Uh, Mario's dead. And Bowser. This is cutting it close. This

456
01:52:38,659 --> 01:52:44,979
is cutting way too close. This is a really, really stupid idea. In fact, it's so dumb, in fact,

457
01:52:44,979 --> 01:53:01,609
that I, I have, I have to heal. I'm gonna heal Bowser. See? This is the no healer team. Yeah,

458
01:53:01,609 --> 01:53:28,840
this is straight offense. This is offense to the max. Nice throw. Pure water. I could sell that

459
01:53:28,840 --> 01:53:34,039
for a lot. All right. Now there's something back here. Something back here. Nope. Nothing back

460
01:53:34,039 --> 01:54:03,020
here. Nothing back there. All right. I just had to check. Full health. Let's see. Oh, it's, this is

461
01:54:03,020 --> 01:54:21,340
where it is. Okay. You got it. I got him. All right. This is another mimic. Ow. Gino Waro. Let's go,

462
01:54:21,340 --> 01:54:30,920
baby. Damn it. I didn't get it. It's right after it hits, right? It's like right after it goes off

463
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:45,130
screen or is it right when he winks to the camera? Holy shit. That was a lot of damage.

464
01:54:56,010 --> 01:55:29,510
That was so much. Let's get it. Ah. Oh my God. I just, I destroyed this thing. I love the little

465
01:55:29,510 --> 01:55:53,239
itchy goombas. They like the little, like itchies. Ow. 22 fucking damage, Mario. Are you for real?

466
01:55:53,239 --> 01:55:59,060
Are we sure that Mario has armor on? I didn't take Mario's armor off, right?

467
01:55:59,060 --> 01:56:27,000
100 coins, 17 experience and got a safety badge. Very cool. Let's actually, let's do some

468
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:36,710
reorganizing here. Safety badge. Prevents mute and poison attacks. The amulet on Mario

469
01:56:39,270 --> 01:56:51,220
is not as good as the amulet on, actually the amulet on Gino is also bad. 125 wakeup pin.

470
01:56:51,859 --> 01:56:56,340
No. Jump shoes. Jump shoes are better than the amulet? How the fuck is that possible?

471
01:57:00,739 --> 01:57:08,600
No. I am really, really stupid. I read it backwards for no reason. All right. Safety badge

472
01:57:08,600 --> 01:57:18,970
is better than the, yeah. That prevents mute and poison. What does this next? I think that's

473
01:57:18,970 --> 01:57:29,460
better because now Mario's got 74, 45, 62, 45. So Gino now is going to be pretty, pretty shitty.

474
01:57:30,260 --> 01:57:43,100
It's all right though. I think we're good. Let's take mushroom. Max mushroom. I need some

475
01:57:43,100 --> 01:57:58,380
mushrooms. I have all these like caro caro colas. Too much maple syrup. Pick me up, pick me up.

476
01:57:59,020 --> 01:58:12,060
Mushroom, mid mushroom, mid mushroom, max mushroom, max mushroom. Jupiter storm coming in.

477
01:58:14,939 --> 01:58:31,270
Whatever. No, no, no, no, no. All right, here we go. It's what? Why is this back? Oh.

478
01:58:35,260 --> 01:58:43,859
Go to the door. Was there, was there a door here? Is it a door? Holy shit. It's a frog coin.

479
01:58:44,500 --> 01:58:57,260
We're going to jump immediately. Nope. Jump one, two. Oh, you idiot. Wait, I can,

480
01:59:04,380 --> 01:59:23,500
I gotta run. I don't want to fight this. No, I'll just fight it. No, I want to run. Good. All right.

481
01:59:23,500 --> 01:59:40,979
Frog coin down there. I wonder if I can go in a little whirlpool or something.

482
01:59:41,619 --> 01:59:49,380
There's a lot of frog coins down here. Three. Keep your eye on those. I'm going to check this

483
01:59:49,460 --> 02:00:11,819
out later. Oh, it's Christmas morning. Wow. Nice. When's the carnival stream? September 21st.

484
02:00:14,470 --> 02:00:55,859
Anything else up here? No, the door, right? No. Yeah. Now we're underwater. See you in 19 days.

485
02:00:55,859 --> 02:01:25,930
That's true. I will be here in 19 days. I'm running away. Ow. Coward. I'm telling my mom on you.

486
02:01:39,800 --> 02:01:46,500
Indecisive today. I feel like all of Toadstools have been completely split.

487
02:01:48,500 --> 02:02:18,619
At least 20 to 30 percent on each one. I wonder why that is. 75. Aye yai yai. I think they have

488
02:02:18,619 --> 02:02:51,100
a hundred health. Mr. Kipper. 36. What is that bullshit? You want to bring, you want to bring,

489
02:02:51,100 --> 02:03:16,020
you want to bring Peach out? Who do I replace? 75, 97. So I do the original, the original Nintendo

490
02:03:16,020 --> 02:03:26,119
Dream Team. Bowser's too good. Bowser's the best of the three so far. I'll do it for a little bit.

491
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:35,060
Uh, hold on. Does she have any weapons? She has slap glove, polka dress, and she's about to have

492
02:03:35,060 --> 02:03:49,220
a wake-up pin. Now get the thing off of, uh, Gino. What does Gino have for a safety badge, right?

493
02:03:54,260 --> 02:04:04,390
Get Mario out of here? I would. I can't. 62 wake-up pin jumpshoes. All right, let's, let's,

494
02:04:04,390 --> 02:04:27,319
let's see what, let's see what she can do. Point to point. All the stuff is outdated.

495
02:04:28,739 --> 02:04:40,229
Oh shit, that's right. Uh oh. What's going on here? Who are you? What are you looking for? A star?

496
02:04:40,949 --> 02:04:49,180
I'll let you see stars. Anyway, you're out of luck. You see, whenever falls into the sea becomes

497
02:04:49,180 --> 02:04:57,659
Johnny's property. Got that, matey? Oh, and one last thing. Read my lips. We ain't letting you

498
02:04:57,659 --> 02:05:33,770
through. Read my lips. No new taxes. Therapy. Group hug. Sleepy time. It didn't do anything.

499
02:05:34,729 --> 02:05:57,289
Oh, oh my chest. Oh, 210. You guys want me to replace Bowser?

500
02:06:00,819 --> 02:06:18,819
That's a great, that's a great attack. Whack, whack, whack. Terma sucks. Terma sucks. What the

501
02:06:18,819 --> 02:06:29,699
hell is this? Bowser at level 12. Breached 100 attack. Magic attack and magic defense is so bad,

502
02:06:29,699 --> 02:06:38,149
though. Terrible. Just awful. I have to put Gino back in because she doesn't have any of her armor

503
02:06:38,149 --> 02:06:54,460
or any new weapon or anything, so we're gonna do it after this. She's a healer. Okay, all right.

504
02:06:54,460 --> 02:07:20,010
No, I'll stick with it. Power. More power. More power. 105. Are you stronger than you look?

505
02:07:21,289 --> 02:07:36,500
Better warm me up her dick. Come on, mates. All right, where's the intruder? I don't see him.

506
02:07:37,880 --> 02:07:52,359
Did he get away? There he is. Get him, boys. Here, this is on us. Oh, what the, how dare you dodge

507
02:07:52,359 --> 02:08:06,619
the barrel? Are you guys all right? Are you guys okay? Hey, how'd you get up here so fast? Well,

508
02:08:06,619 --> 02:08:15,060
your luck has run out. We don't take kindly to strangers here. That's a lot. Okay, this is a lot.

509
02:08:15,619 --> 02:08:45,340
Poison gas time. Oh, that's pretty good. Are they poison? Oh, they are poison. Eight damage a tick.

510
02:08:46,300 --> 02:09:04,420
That's not good. Let's do it again. I wonder if I'll do it. There, nice. I think I can kill them

511
02:09:04,420 --> 02:09:27,659
all with just regular attacks now. Dealing 70 damage is pretty good regardless of no magic.

512
02:09:27,659 --> 02:09:39,380
Yeah, that is really good. You're pretty tough, mate. All right, I'll let you through to the

513
02:09:39,380 --> 02:09:56,699
Johnny's place. You're pretty tough. You're pretty tough. Yeah, so you're the Mario. Yeah,

514
02:09:58,220 --> 02:10:04,409
not much to look at. Well, this store fell into my sea, so it's mine. If you want it,

515
02:10:04,409 --> 02:10:23,539
you'll have to fight for it. Here's a boss fight. I probably could have done that a little,

516
02:10:24,500 --> 02:10:41,739
a little more of the promotion in there. Got them all except the one over here. All right,

517
02:10:41,739 --> 02:10:59,350
I'm thinking a super jump on Johnny. 58, 70. Whoa, that's really, really fucking good.

518
02:11:00,069 --> 02:11:03,989
That's, all right Bowser, you've solidified yourself as the best character.

519
02:11:04,710 --> 02:11:25,460
Now, the strategy here is you want to get rid of the minions, but you want to leave a minion,

520
02:11:25,460 --> 02:11:30,260
because if you don't, oh, and guys, I just got a lucky. You know what that means? I'm going to be

521
02:11:30,260 --> 02:11:42,250
relying on you to double whatever happens here. This is going to be a huge deal. I do not want to

522
02:11:42,250 --> 02:12:04,069
kill Lucky again. Double. I'm going to heal myself. It's a pretty good heal. That's so good.

523
02:12:04,630 --> 02:12:22,579
It's almost worth doing the poison gas and killing this thing again. 102. Yeah, tough. I wonder,

524
02:12:22,579 --> 02:12:39,340
can I put him to sleep? I wonder if I can mess him up. Yeah, it takes less damage now.

525
02:12:49,800 --> 02:12:59,420
Hmm, we're good. Putting a status, you're doing a status effect on a boss in an RPG.

526
02:13:00,539 --> 02:13:24,810
Well, he said, I know, right. It's a bad idea. They're all immune. That was terrible. Don't

527
02:13:24,810 --> 02:13:43,350
kill him. It's a shiny. Well, that's just too bad. If it truly was a shiny, he'd have sprinkles

528
02:13:43,350 --> 02:14:12,890
flying around him. Let's try 26. Come on. Stop it. Who does he heal? Try to top off somebody.

529
02:14:13,770 --> 02:14:26,170
Let's just group hug. Good. Well, Peach is actually pretty damn good. See you later. See

530
02:14:26,170 --> 02:14:42,300
you later, Tony. All right, guys, double your coins. We'll lose them all. I probably should

531
02:14:42,300 --> 02:14:52,020
have given you just a second. I didn't even give you guys a second. People might not have even

532
02:14:52,020 --> 02:14:58,970
looking at the monitor. Oops, I'm sorry. Oh, no, this is bad. I don't know which one. It could be

533
02:14:58,970 --> 02:15:05,659
any one of these then. I don't know why I did that. I'm sorry. I just, I don't know.

534
02:15:08,899 --> 02:15:17,539
Is it the middle one? Holy shit, you guys did it. I can't fucking believe it. Nice. And Malos

535
02:15:17,539 --> 02:15:35,930
leveled up. Well, thank you, Benedict Cumberbatch, for being right. They said I was right. Good.

536
02:15:36,010 --> 02:15:56,300
Thank you. Thanks for the help. Okay, more magic. I should just honestly replace. I mean,

537
02:15:57,340 --> 02:16:06,199
no, I can't do that. Okay, I'm, I'm impressed. Mighty. You've earned the star.

538
02:16:07,350 --> 02:16:23,130
Think of it as a souvenir of our fight. Funnily enough, Johnny's voice was voted the worst voice

539
02:16:23,130 --> 02:16:31,420
of the whole playthrough by a majority of Jerma985 subscribers. When interviewed about it, Jerma

540
02:16:32,139 --> 02:16:41,430
very clearly said, I just wanted to do Mad Eye Moody again. And it was an excuse to do it.

541
02:16:41,430 --> 02:16:58,469
End quote. He must have really wanted that star. Now go on and get out of here before I change my

542
02:16:58,469 --> 02:17:09,719
mind. Johnny's our main man. He even fights in his sleep. We'd follow him anywhere. Hop on the

543
02:17:09,719 --> 02:17:19,819
trampoline in the next room. It'll take you outside. Go on now. Give it a try. Okay. Thanks, guys.

544
02:17:20,379 --> 02:17:42,780
Hmm. 50 bucks. Oh, shit. Mr. Purple, thanks for the $50. 5000 bits, they say. When are you pursuing

545
02:17:42,780 --> 02:17:54,229
a career in voice acting? Never. Right now, actually. You found the star. Well done.

546
02:17:55,110 --> 02:18:03,750
My dear Johnny, end here. You are so gullible. Don't you know who I am? I'm Yardage,

547
02:18:03,750 --> 02:18:11,030
a member of Smithy's gang. Chalked. It's no wonder my impersonation of an ordinary person was

548
02:18:11,030 --> 02:18:18,500
flawless. Your search for the stars has worried Smithy. So if I take the star back to him,

549
02:18:18,500 --> 02:18:25,940
I'll earn a brownie points. This is the way to get ahead. It's futile to try and fight me,

550
02:18:25,940 --> 02:18:45,989
just hand it off nice and easy. And to think I got the star without even soiling my pants.

551
02:18:46,790 --> 02:18:53,899
I'm such a genius, it scares me sometimes. No wonder I'm so important. All right, everyone,

552
02:18:53,899 --> 02:19:02,069
listen up. We're returning to the castle. All right, should be here about now. Wait, come back.

553
02:19:02,790 --> 02:19:44,940
I didn't mean to give it to you. I can't get a free night. It's locked. Hey, someone's in there.

554
02:19:56,250 --> 02:20:04,340
Blade's late. What's taking him so long? We need to get out of here. I gotta get out of here.

555
02:20:04,340 --> 02:20:11,930
This is just great. Mario got up with us. Only one thing we can do now, and although we may

556
02:20:11,930 --> 02:20:21,930
be a little rusty, we'll have to swim for it. Not so fast there. That star is a gift to me,

557
02:20:21,930 --> 02:20:27,829
mate. Mario, you spineless dogs have no code of honor. We'll make you a walk the plank.

558
02:20:30,180 --> 02:20:34,579
Joy! Maybe we should have leave the Mario the pleasure of wrapping things up here.

559
02:20:39,670 --> 02:21:10,600
Eh. I guess we'll take our disguises off now. Group formation! No rest. Three bosses in a row.

560
02:21:10,600 --> 02:21:20,739
No rest. Oh, fuck. This actually is bad. This is actually a hard fight, and he does a lot of damage,

561
02:21:20,739 --> 02:21:25,379
as you'll see in a second. Oh, yeah, this is bad. I'm gonna lose. When was the last time I saved

562
02:21:25,379 --> 02:21:44,969
the game? Okay. Oh, good. Good. Yeah, you're right. Right. Oh, boy, this is bad. Okay. Bowser,

563
02:21:44,969 --> 02:22:17,799
it's off, too. Oof. What, super jump, maybe? No. Mario, you are not very good. Are you good,

564
02:22:17,799 --> 02:22:40,260
Jerma? You're forgetting things that happened seconds ago. You're telling me that, that...

565
02:22:40,260 --> 02:22:46,340
Okay, he must have a high magic damage blocker. Can't eat a group hug right now, or everyone

566
02:22:46,340 --> 02:22:57,500
dies. Good. Uh, if Peach was not part of this party, I would lose. So, good party swap before

567
02:22:57,500 --> 02:23:11,190
this encounter. Which one's the real Yardavich? That's not the real Yardavich. This is the real

568
02:23:11,190 --> 02:23:37,420
Yardavich. Yep. I have plenty of FP. Good thing I blocked that. Nice block, Peach. Come back

569
02:23:37,420 --> 02:23:47,209
together again. Uh, I need to keep Peach alive, so we're just gonna keep the heal up. Yeah.

570
02:23:58,520 --> 02:24:22,250
I'm all right. I'm gonna just heal Mario. Thank you. All right, they're back together again.

571
02:24:36,889 --> 02:24:50,659
Three. I need another group hug. This would have been hell without Peach. I would have used every

572
02:24:50,659 --> 02:25:01,049
poke. Somebody would have just had been on total item duty, and that actually, that also may have

573
02:25:01,049 --> 02:25:14,889
killed Peach as well. Oh, not good. Um, I actually, I'm gonna just, I was gonna use a mushroom on

574
02:25:14,889 --> 02:25:26,790
Peach, but no. Should be all right. No, she won't. All right, she would have been fine.

575
02:25:27,350 --> 02:25:46,629
Ow. God damn it. Stop targeting Peach. Well, I guess you're doing the right thing. Just defend

576
02:25:46,629 --> 02:25:55,020
with Peach. Yeah, that's not a, no, no, I don't even have to. Counter's over. I win. That could

577
02:25:55,020 --> 02:26:08,760
have been way worse. Mario has reached level 12. Almost 100 health on Mario. Uh, let's get,

578
02:26:09,959 --> 02:26:45,780
my click maps is currently disconnected. What? Uh, that's weird. All right, go for it. 31 to 30.

579
02:26:45,780 --> 02:26:53,180
Oh, it's a fight. It's a chat fight. Who's gonna prevail? The thing that we click on every single

580
02:26:53,180 --> 02:27:01,959
time or something new. By the way, that is 30. That is over 30%. That's 34%, guys, because Mario,

581
02:27:01,959 --> 02:27:22,100
they're overlapping. Pride flowers at 20%. Uh oh. Oh no, it's, oh, it's bullshit because there's 10,000

582
02:27:22,100 --> 02:27:27,270
clicks. Sorry, guys. I didn't have the thing where you can't click a thousand times.

583
02:27:28,149 --> 02:28:04,309
Choose wisely. Oh my God. How about just pick one? Wow. It's time to close it in 10,

584
02:28:05,030 --> 02:28:32,629
nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero. Fuck. Nice work, everybody.

585
02:28:36,229 --> 02:28:57,159
Try again. This is flower. Oh, right. Flower. Oh, you know, actually kind of, I like, I like the

586
02:28:57,159 --> 02:29:03,819
whole like right flower. Everyone click right flower because that, that's just a place for

587
02:29:03,819 --> 02:29:09,579
people who's vote. They, you know, we got like a nice clean, like 60% of our audience here voting

588
02:29:09,579 --> 02:29:14,899
here. We've distracted the, the people that are just messing around. So this is a really good

589
02:29:14,899 --> 02:29:38,469
thing to do, I think. It doesn't really matter, could still magic. 57, 35. Got it. Smithy is now

590
02:29:38,469 --> 02:29:44,040
in the hurries for the star pieces. What horrible surprises might he have in store for Mario?

591
02:29:44,680 --> 02:29:49,350
It's the last chance I'm going to be able to have. I'm not going to be able to do that anymore. So

592
02:29:52,389 --> 02:29:59,530
nope. To Mario. To Mario. No one knew it must have been a breeze knocking out Yardovich.

593
02:30:00,090 --> 02:30:03,879
Ah, by the way, my pirates say they saw a huge axe flying across the sky.

594
02:30:04,440 --> 02:30:10,180
Hey, it's probably one of the Smithy's nasty friends. Go get him, pal. Well, my girls have

595
02:30:10,180 --> 02:30:18,790
hailed on me. So I'll be heading back down now. Drop him. I couldn't read the rest. It was shitty

596
02:30:18,790 --> 02:30:38,940
handwriting. Here we go. Let's get in here. Hey, everybody. I've come to rescue you. Thank you so

597
02:30:38,940 --> 02:30:44,620
much. I've had enough cramped dirty old places like this. Hey, fellow, you got outside of a blind

598
02:30:44,700 --> 02:30:51,579
piece. It was mighty unpleasant in here. Thanks for helping us. Thank you. Yeah, thanks. Be sure

599
02:30:51,579 --> 02:30:58,260
to stop by our shop. Well, thank you for freeing us. I've got to get back to work now but stop by

600
02:30:58,260 --> 02:31:09,739
at the end. See you there. Hey, Mario. Thank you for saving our little town of Seaside.

601
02:31:10,709 --> 02:31:17,510
You exposed the fake townspeople and gave up your star to save us. Please take this with our thanks.

602
02:31:17,590 --> 02:31:32,409
Got a flower box. This townspeople all sound like fucking goofy. Five distinct voices.

603
02:31:32,409 --> 02:31:50,540
Count them. Weapon and armor. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes. Yes. I got 999

604
02:31:50,540 --> 02:32:02,329
Geno World coins. Yes. Okay, hold on. Wait, wait, wait. This is important. This is an overwhelming

605
02:32:02,329 --> 02:32:08,379
amount of cool items, equipable items. Let's go with... This is a Mario weapon. This is the

606
02:32:08,379 --> 02:32:15,479
Trooper Shell. I think this is better. This is the Parasol. This is for Toadstool. We want that.

607
02:32:16,280 --> 02:32:29,079
Double Punch for Geno. Yep. Ribbit stick for Mallow. Okay. Please come in and browse. I'm running an

608
02:32:29,079 --> 02:32:37,110
armor shop. Here we go. Sailor shirt. Sailor pants. Sailor cape. Nautica dress. Get... No.

609
02:32:37,989 --> 02:32:47,530
We're about to go... No. We're gonna go to a new town. Nope. All right, I'll get one. Trooper Shell.

610
02:32:47,530 --> 02:32:55,510
Masher is currently at 132. Oh, but I'm sick of looking at this shit. It's different.

611
02:32:55,510 --> 02:32:58,629
It's the same damn thing. It's different though. It's... I don't want to see that same animation.

612
02:32:58,629 --> 02:33:10,870
Get that thing out of here. Parasol. 96. That's much better. Double Punch is for Geno. Better than

613
02:33:10,870 --> 02:33:20,360
the handgun. Double Punch. 125. Without an accessory. Holy shit, Geno. Ribbit stick. 100.

614
02:33:20,360 --> 02:33:35,459
Better than symbols. Of course it is. Polka dress. Nautica dress. Much better. All right. So now we've

615
02:33:35,459 --> 02:33:46,250
got... That's all right. I'm gonna stick with Peach for a little while. Let's sell this stuff.

616
02:33:48,149 --> 02:34:03,370
Symbols. Masher. Handgun. Slap glove. Polka dress. Good. I got a lot of money. All right. Now,

617
02:34:03,370 --> 02:34:12,389
let's go up here. Mario, if it's a star that you're looking for, I may be able to help you.

618
02:34:13,030 --> 02:34:19,430
At the far side of Land's End is a town made up of reformed monsters. A mouse came by the other day,

619
02:34:19,430 --> 02:34:24,469
and I overheard him boasting about a star of theirs. I don't know exactly where this town

620
02:34:24,469 --> 02:34:35,590
is located, but if you follow the road, you'll get there. Good to see you again. Do you have a

621
02:34:35,590 --> 02:34:42,709
chance to accumulate many frown coins? Yeah, I got plenty. No, that's what I wanted. Dumb. I need

622
02:34:42,709 --> 02:35:05,430
one more. Hi, Mario. We've got a lot of health foods at our store. You gotta treat your body right.

623
02:35:10,260 --> 02:35:17,180
This is a terrible store. Where are the mid mushrooms? I thought I could have a mid mushroom.

624
02:35:23,370 --> 02:35:28,329
Hey, hey, hey. I'm the mushroom boy. Did you know that hidden amongst the regular mushrooms

625
02:35:28,329 --> 02:35:34,329
are some special ones? Unreal, huh? I'll give you items in return for those special mushrooms,

626
02:35:34,329 --> 02:35:40,629
but you've got to taste them to find out what kind they are. So I'll take a nibble first. I'm

627
02:35:40,629 --> 02:35:44,549
hoping for a special mushroom, but even if it isn't, at least I'll get a meal out of it.

628
02:35:45,190 --> 02:35:51,959
You have any mushrooms? Far out. Munch, munch, munch. That was just a regular mushroom. Thanks

629
02:35:51,959 --> 02:36:06,649
for the snack. Is this the way for this guy to just get free food? I don't remember you.

630
02:36:09,819 --> 02:36:18,120
Accessories. Oh, hello there. You were so brave to rescue us, and I'm so thankful. But listen,

631
02:36:18,120 --> 02:36:20,600
maybe it's time you thought a little more about what you wear.

632
02:36:21,700 --> 02:36:25,780
Accessorizing is a big business these days. Say anything you like here.

633
02:36:28,680 --> 02:36:43,430
Antidote is pretty good. I already have fearless. True form Zoom shoes. You don't really...

634
02:36:47,719 --> 02:36:52,600
Pitch shifted goofy is actually a pretty good voice. What do you mean pitch shifted goofy?

635
02:36:53,159 --> 02:37:26,790
Pitched up or pitched down? It's pitched down? No, it's not. Five stars. All right, on our way.

636
02:37:27,590 --> 02:37:40,360
Let's continue. I've got my items to land's end. Can you do the Trump voice for a character,

637
02:37:40,360 --> 02:38:02,139
please? Yeah, sure. The next character that shows up will be Trump. Jumped it.

638
02:38:19,219 --> 02:38:55,290
I want to get up there. Oh, how do I get this? Oh, look out. I sound like an alternate universe

639
02:38:55,290 --> 02:39:05,700
Ray Romano. I 100% do not sound like Ray Romano. I don't... I don't know where you're getting that

640
02:39:05,700 --> 02:39:15,639
from. What? We're talking... We're thinking of the same person, right? We're thinking of...

641
02:39:15,639 --> 02:39:22,010
We're thinking of Ray Romano, right? Well, you know, it's me, Ray Romano. That's who you think...

642
02:39:22,010 --> 02:39:47,059
You think I sound like that? Right now? You think I sound like Ray Romano? This guy's a no joke.

643
02:39:54,979 --> 02:39:58,659
Pitch is dead. All right, I need to stop paying attention to the fact that like somebody thinks

644
02:39:58,659 --> 02:40:04,100
I sound like Ray Romano because everyone's going to die here. Like Mario's about to die.

645
02:40:04,100 --> 02:40:10,069
Bowser's about to be dead. They're both asleep. This is the first death incoming. Not quite.

646
02:40:10,790 --> 02:40:40,459
You idiot. I want to go down because I want to check out this over here. There's some things I

647
02:40:40,459 --> 02:40:50,250
think that are possible. Oh, I need this. I thought that was something. I'm just wrong all the time.

648
02:40:51,209 --> 02:41:28,540
Ow. I do like the parasol. You just open it on him. I guess there's no... There's no way to get at it.

649
02:41:29,180 --> 02:41:49,319
This is bad. Again, very bad. I need Peach to do group hug or I lose. Don't kill Peach.

650
02:41:51,750 --> 02:42:18,709
Miss. I'm not going to revive. Why would I do that? Peach does not have a very good

651
02:42:19,750 --> 02:42:35,510
physical power right now, unfortunately. Although someone's going to level up soon.

652
02:42:35,590 --> 02:42:46,299
Get up. I'm trying to dodge so bad. I don't want to fight these guys. I don't... I need to get

653
02:42:46,299 --> 02:43:09,020
a lick to an HP station. Save. Let's check it out. Wait a minute. Hold on. Oh. Uh-huh.

654
02:43:10,069 --> 02:43:15,979
This is the obstacle course. I remember this. And there's our friendly friend up there.

655
02:43:17,530 --> 02:43:43,659
I'm happy for this. Not a secret. Not a secret. I forgot. I forgot. I forgot. I'm just going to

656
02:43:43,659 --> 02:43:47,819
revive them. I got plenty of these things. I just did a bunch of bosses in a row. What am I going to

657
02:43:47,819 --> 02:44:03,239
use these for? Oh, sleep sauce. All right. Here's a game you can play right now in your room.

658
02:44:03,239 --> 02:44:13,340
Try... Say sleep sauce with as much syllabus as you can. Sleep suss. Oh, sleep suss. It's pretty

659
02:44:13,340 --> 02:45:02,940
funny. That's right. You've run. There we go. Peach level 13. Did you learn any new moves?

660
02:45:03,799 --> 02:45:43,780
Come back. That is the revive. Nice. What am I supposed to say about this? Thank you for voting.

661
02:45:50,969 --> 02:46:08,250
58. Oh, come on. I actually do need... No, I don't. Come back. Oh my god. I'm really,

662
02:46:08,250 --> 02:46:55,379
really impatient. I tried to get away from the fucking bee. Stop fucking this up. All right.

663
02:46:55,379 --> 02:47:03,559
So here this is... Welcome to the sky bridge. It's a big tourist attraction here. Yeah.

664
02:47:04,200 --> 02:47:23,450
You want to challenge it? Sure. I'll need five coins. Wait, am I getting minus two

665
02:47:23,450 --> 02:47:28,659
because it's not... I didn't do Trump. This guy already existed in the universe. You can't do that.

666
02:47:29,379 --> 02:47:32,819
This guy already had a voice. He existed in the universe. I'm trying to say the next new character.

667
02:47:33,540 --> 02:47:47,579
It was the Yahoo. No, was it? I thought that was pretty good. You can cross the sky bridge in one

668
02:47:47,579 --> 02:47:52,709
of three ways. However, if you fall at any time, you lose. On the normal course, you'll make it

669
02:47:52,709 --> 02:47:58,549
across just by jumping. You'll get five coins for that. On the special course, the blocks will fall

670
02:47:58,549 --> 02:48:04,229
if your time runs out. You'll get eight coins there. On the expert course, the blocks will fall and

671
02:48:04,229 --> 02:48:09,610
the jumps are harder. You'll get a frog coin. On all the courses, you'll have to jump and avoid

672
02:48:09,610 --> 02:48:16,489
the bullet guides. Which course do you want? Normal first. We're going to go one, two, three.

673
02:48:17,209 --> 02:48:34,379
All right. I got my investment back. Yahoo. You want to double your winnings. Get double the coins

674
02:48:34,379 --> 02:48:37,979
you make it across in the same course in one attempt. The course is harder and if you fall,

675
02:48:37,979 --> 02:48:56,649
you won't get any coins. Still want to try? Yeah, let's do it again. Thank you. You want to double

676
02:48:56,649 --> 02:48:59,129
your winnings. Get double the coins. You make it across in the same course in one attempt.

677
02:49:01,129 --> 02:49:24,219
Yeah, that was great. Here you go. 20 coins. I want to do it again. I want to do the harder one.

678
02:49:24,940 --> 02:49:46,600
Okay, let's challenge it. I'll need five coins. Let's do special. Thank you.

679
02:49:47,239 --> 02:49:49,639
Want to double your winnings. Get double the coins. You make it across the same course in one

680
02:49:49,639 --> 02:49:52,200
attempt. The course is harder. If you fall, you're going to lose your coins. Let's try it again.

681
02:49:53,079 --> 02:49:58,950
The audio is half a second behind the video. Why does this keep happening?

682
02:50:00,409 --> 02:50:13,530
No, I need to pay attention. I swear to god this happens. Like half the time. It's either that or

683
02:50:13,530 --> 02:50:28,780
I'm being lied to half the time. I panicked. Sorry. Let's do it again. I'll get it this time.

684
02:50:31,829 --> 02:50:34,229
And then I'm going for the frog coins. I'm going for three frog coins next.

685
02:50:34,950 --> 02:51:06,229
Give me my frog coin. Two frog coins.

686
02:51:33,909 --> 02:51:58,469
Oh, what the fuck? That's so infuriating. That's so annoying. I had it too. Do it again. Come on.

687
02:51:58,469 --> 02:52:19,530
I know I can do this. Three points. No, that's four coins. All right, let's go.

688
02:52:20,250 --> 02:52:35,450
This is the one. Let's go. This is four frog coins. I need these. Thanks a lot. I'll take it all.

689
02:52:37,100 --> 02:52:37,899
Four frog coins.

690
02:52:38,379 --> 02:52:49,270
Ah, haven't been here in a while. I've been busy traveling around.

691
02:52:50,069 --> 02:52:59,190
Where are you headed? Is it Monstro Town by any chance? Yeah. Okay, listen up. Look for the

692
02:52:59,190 --> 02:53:04,709
world where the ant pops up and proceed after it. Keep following it and you'll find your way around

693
02:53:04,709 --> 02:53:12,149
underground. Once there, Monstro Town's just around the corner. I'll see you there.

694
02:53:12,790 --> 02:53:45,690
I forgot and I get the end. I remembered. Oh shit. I think I poison gassed this.

695
02:54:13,700 --> 02:54:20,069
I need how much? 2159. That's all right. Let's do a super flame.

696
02:54:24,549 --> 02:55:03,180
That's not good. 130. There it is. What is it called? About a what? 104 fucking damage. 52.

697
02:55:04,139 --> 02:55:23,479
Um, just keep the hills up. I can take a maple syrup if I need to. Damn it. Uh oh.

698
02:55:24,040 --> 02:56:09,020
Staticky is not that bad. 30 exp and a Bowser level up. 120, 109. Not bad. Hey, what is that?

699
02:56:09,979 --> 02:56:33,750
Hey chat, who's bored? Let's talk. I have a discussion. Talk. Talk to each other. Communicate

700
02:56:33,750 --> 02:56:53,850
with each other. You should be talking to each other. What was over here? Look, I'll give you a

701
02:56:53,930 --> 02:57:04,260
discussion, okay? Over easy, over medium, over hard. Why would you choose any of those? Which

702
02:57:04,260 --> 02:57:27,180
one do you prefer? Now, I need a syrup. Me, I prefer over medium and the reason why I do I like

703
02:57:27,180 --> 02:57:32,299
over medium is because I don't, when a yolk gets really runny, it just kind of gets all over the

704
02:57:32,299 --> 02:57:37,829
place. You bite into it and it turns into water on your plate. It's just, you don't, it's kind of,

705
02:57:37,829 --> 02:57:44,469
I don't like it. Over medium gives a soft yolk, but still it's like almost like a gel. But it's

706
02:57:44,469 --> 02:57:48,389
hot and it's able to be spread on stuff. You can put it on your toast. You can dip stuff in it.

707
02:57:52,840 --> 02:58:16,790
Over hard is just too much. Too solid. Poison gas. Only one person got hit by that. I don't believe

708
02:58:16,790 --> 02:58:31,100
it. I refuse to believe it. I forgot the ants were annoying. They do a ton of damage and they're hard

709
02:58:31,100 --> 02:59:06,739
to kill. Once again. Ow. Pick me up. Let's do this while we're here. Good. I don't even remember

710
02:59:06,739 --> 02:59:12,340
which one it was because I had to go to the menu. God. Shit. They just spun around like crazy.

711
02:59:13,139 --> 02:59:24,950
Oh, another one of these. Come here. Get over here. Come here. Patrick. Patrick, help me.

712
02:59:25,590 --> 02:59:44,950
It's supposed to be a jellyfish. That's like half of your guy's favorite fucking show.

713
02:59:45,510 --> 03:00:46,219
It's not mine. It's a pre-30 experience every time. Come on. I gotta hit them all with this.

714
03:00:53,799 --> 03:01:22,299
Finally. They should die from the poison. At least I hope they do. It's not enough.

715
03:01:22,299 --> 03:01:55,350
Somebody else is gonna level up here. Going in. What the hell was that? I really wish I had,

716
03:01:57,000 --> 03:02:04,059
I might switch Malabar for Bowser for this part because I really want to get like 100 damage on

717
03:02:04,059 --> 03:02:42,090
each one. I think that'll kill them, right? It's 90. 30. No, I think they have 150 each. Sneak us

718
03:02:42,090 --> 03:02:52,540
through to Monstro Town. Hey, look. Mario's level 13. Look at that magic defense. That's the worst

719
03:02:52,540 --> 03:02:58,840
out of everybody and that I have in the whole game. Fly far. Do the right thing here. Come on.

720
03:03:31,290 --> 03:03:39,399
Well, I may as well just press power every time, I think. Can I ask a question? This is a very

721
03:03:39,399 --> 03:04:03,579
serious question. Is it because the POW symbol is the coolest looking? Is that why? HP is for babies

722
03:04:06,489 --> 03:04:13,959
because I want you to suffer. Well, we've got a pretty interesting combination here.

723
03:04:22,139 --> 03:04:57,579
Five seconds. I'm bringing Malo in. Malo for, Malo for Bowser for, just for now. Why'd you do that?

724
03:04:57,579 --> 03:05:14,520
Really? That's so irritating. All right, let's see if we can get a couple of kills here. I don't have

725
03:05:14,520 --> 03:05:23,620
enough for Shocker, but how much will Thunderbolt do? Not a lot. I could do it again.

726
03:05:26,280 --> 03:05:53,899
Did Shocker hit more than one person? I don't remember. Big froggy stick. Too bad it sucks.

727
03:05:54,540 --> 03:06:18,950
Somebody else. There we go. Gino. Gino's kind of balanced. Magic defense is not great, but that's

728
03:06:18,950 --> 03:06:30,709
just the nature of the character. Am I gonna play Earthbound? I don't think so. I'm not sure I would

729
03:06:30,709 --> 03:06:58,059
do Earthbound. Jerma will let you choose one for a Sans impression. I don't, it's fine. You can pick

730
03:07:07,159 --> 03:07:44,889
only one point. Come on. Stop baiting me. Stop it. Hello again. Isn't this just incredible? It really

731
03:07:44,889 --> 03:07:49,979
does look like the edge of the world, doesn't it? It's too spooky for me. I'm too scared. I don't

732
03:07:49,979 --> 03:08:08,979
want to do it. I'm heading back to Monstro Town. It's safe. See ya. This comes into play later.

733
03:08:20,149 --> 03:08:30,020
Now this time I'm gonna do Maple Syrup because I want to do Shocker on one of you. What's the

734
03:08:30,020 --> 03:08:41,049
timing on this? I don't know if I got it. I mean, I kind of, you can kind of just drop the Gatorade

735
03:08:41,049 --> 03:09:03,219
symbol on him. So I don't know when I'm supposed to do that. Watch, ready? All right, it's not really

736
03:09:03,219 --> 03:09:10,819
the Gatorade symbol. I thought it looked like it for a second. It's not. It's not even close.

737
03:09:21,930 --> 03:09:52,790
Let's read a mind. I want to see what the ants are thinking. Do as you like. Okay. Pick me up.

738
03:09:52,790 --> 03:10:12,299
And another level up. No. Oh, I think that's a star down there. I'm super excited. Here we go.

739
03:10:23,639 --> 03:10:56,389
Oh, I got them all. Yeah. 14. Why would I do a Sans impression? There's no reason to do that.

740
03:11:05,030 --> 03:11:20,840
Sans. Do Sans. Sans. Please. Please. Please. What? Why does everybody want the Sans voice today?

741
03:11:20,840 --> 03:11:25,000
I've never seen that. Even when I was playing Undertale, people didn't say do the Sans voice.

742
03:11:25,000 --> 03:11:50,819
Do the Sans voice. Maybe if you're good. And you guys actually picked the HP. Smart. Let's see if

743
03:11:50,819 --> 03:12:20,819
you continue to be smart. Yeah, you have to be good for the rest of the stream. And then maybe

744
03:12:20,819 --> 03:12:34,059
I'll do it at the end. Yeah. Hey, Santa comes on December 24th, not January 2nd. I've been good

745
03:12:34,059 --> 03:12:44,329
for one day. No, you got to be good all year before he figures it out. You're looking for a star? I'll

746
03:12:44,329 --> 03:12:53,610
sell you one for 400 coins. Hold on. Let me see. No, no, no, no, no, no. Come back. No, no, no. Wait.

747
03:12:53,610 --> 03:13:00,020
Did I fuck that up? He's back, right? Yeah. I got, I got plenty of money. I got a ton of money. He's

748
03:13:00,020 --> 03:13:09,399
still there, right? He's there, right? Oh, fuck me. Come on. Really? I'm going to leave and come back.

749
03:13:09,399 --> 03:14:09,879
How long ago is that safe? I don't remember how long ago that was. Is it right here? It was right

750
03:14:09,879 --> 03:14:44,149
here, right? It's literally right here. It was minutes ago. Okay. Thank you. All right. We're

751
03:14:44,149 --> 03:15:01,139
finally go. All right. I remember what you guys picked. You guys, it was uh, Peach was HP. I

752
03:15:01,139 --> 03:15:19,129
remember Bowser was power. Here we go. 400 coins. Looking for a star. Yes. Thank you for the star

753
03:15:19,129 --> 03:15:32,979
and thank you for the like two levels. Let's go. What the hell? Why did I just freeze? I need to

754
03:15:32,979 --> 03:15:44,489
get them all. I have to kill the thing. All right. Ultra jump has been learned.

755
03:15:50,420 --> 03:16:26,950
Hey, you happy? Let's go. Like he was so pumped up. Let's go. Yo, let's go. Oh, yeah, dude. Fucking

756
03:16:26,950 --> 03:16:45,639
hype. Oh, wait, hold on a second. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I get to pick one now.

757
03:16:45,639 --> 03:17:17,000
Excuse me. You know, blast caution confused monster himself. He just tried to hit himself

758
03:17:17,000 --> 03:17:24,149
in the face. I'm sorry. I want you to like to go home and go to bed. 70 fucking three.

759
03:17:27,110 --> 03:17:40,219
Malo, you fucking toad wannabe. Hey, Malo, you're a fucking toad hat with legs.

760
03:17:45,299 --> 03:18:08,250
You have to plus two it now. I'm gonna pee. I'll be right back. Dude, let's go. Let's go, dude.

761
03:18:08,250 --> 03:20:52,090
Dude, let's fucking go, dude. I was testing you guys. I had to see if I did like a

762
03:20:52,889 --> 03:20:58,170
laugh out loud like boomer joke. Ha ha. And then I ended it with the sands. I did. I needed to see

763
03:20:58,170 --> 03:21:16,940
what was going to happen. My hypothesis was correct. By the way, let's fucking go, dude.

764
03:21:17,979 --> 03:21:56,870
Valom temple. For 100 coins, this shortcut will get you back to the surface. Okay. Should I take

765
03:21:56,870 --> 03:22:16,180
that? I think. Where does it go? To the surface. But is it still available? I'm going to see if

766
03:22:16,180 --> 03:22:38,969
it's still available. Like, can I? I'm good. What are you guys saying? Vinny is a big Chrono

767
03:22:38,969 --> 03:22:46,569
Trigger fan and he loves Earthknot. Yeah, well, I love peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

768
03:22:48,100 --> 03:22:54,489
My brother loves peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but I cannot fucking believe I

769
03:22:54,489 --> 03:23:08,979
can buy another star. Okay, what I was gonna say, so I can come back later. What I was saying is I

770
03:23:08,979 --> 03:23:12,340
love peanut butter and jelly. My brother loves peanut butter and jelly, but my brother hates

771
03:23:13,989 --> 03:23:18,950
mozzarella sticks and I love mozzarella sticks. No, wait, hold on. That's different. I love

772
03:23:18,950 --> 03:23:25,909
peanut butter and fluff. My brother hates peanut butter and fluff. Just because you like peanut

773
03:23:25,909 --> 03:23:29,670
butter doesn't mean you'd like peanut butter. Like the peanut butter is like this just because

774
03:23:29,670 --> 03:23:42,229
you like sandwiches. You know, relax. It's in there somewhere. You'll find it. Do you want your

775
03:23:42,229 --> 03:23:52,280
fortune told? It'll cost 50 coins. Oh shit. Oh, what do I do? Hold on. Let's go. Let's go.

776
03:23:55,719 --> 03:24:02,940
I can't even do it.

777
03:24:06,950 --> 03:24:19,129
That's so funny to me. The three faces on the wall,

778
03:24:19,129 --> 03:24:20,969
hit them in any order and you'll receive your fortune.

779
03:24:22,329 --> 03:24:37,860
All right, I'm gonna say middle, middle, left, right. You want to, no, we're not voting on this

780
03:24:37,860 --> 03:25:00,600
shit. It's easy. Fine. Oh, I don't know why that's doing it for me. Like a guaranteed minus two

781
03:25:00,600 --> 03:25:07,579
moment and I can just instantly switch it around. Even if it's a bad sans and it doesn't matter.

782
03:25:07,579 --> 03:25:23,940
I just say the word eight, eight, eight. I just say eight and it's over. I win. You guys are

783
03:25:23,940 --> 03:25:52,229
programmed to like that. Okay, let's go. Isn't this what I just said I was gonna do? I can't

784
03:25:52,229 --> 03:26:16,069
do middle again, so we're going right. If you proceed through the pipe next door, you'll have

785
03:26:16,069 --> 03:27:07,319
plenty of good things to look forward to. Isn't there a treasure room here if you do it right?

786
03:27:07,959 --> 03:27:35,399
I just thought there was. Snowy. Let's do snowy. Holy shit, that's cool. Very cute.

787
03:27:35,959 --> 03:27:47,829
You think they're putting fishes and Doritos in your comments? They're gonna make me read them?

788
03:27:47,829 --> 03:28:17,899
No. That's a lot of coins. Double the coins. Okay, guys, I'll get this one.

789
03:28:19,739 --> 03:28:41,059
I'm just gonna fucking guess. I don't care. Got them all back. Don't worry.

790
03:28:41,059 --> 03:28:49,739
Nice. I haven't, by the way, I have enough frog coins to get the experience one, which is probably

791
03:28:49,739 --> 03:28:54,420
the best one to get. The yellow tile will get you to the next room. Your fortune determines which

792
03:28:54,420 --> 03:28:59,450
room you'll arrive at. If you're lucky, you'll run into Baylum and Monstro Town will be just beyond

793
03:28:59,450 --> 03:29:23,959
him. I'm so hungry. Wish I had some days. If you're lucky. Get it. Oh, well, I don't have Bowser.

794
03:29:24,680 --> 03:29:41,020
I don't have Bowser. I don't think I can reveal this thing. Can I? Psychopath. I have a secret.

795
03:29:41,500 --> 03:29:55,399
You have a secret. I don't think I can do this. I have to run. It's the gas. There's no way I can

796
03:29:55,399 --> 03:30:04,889
reveal this. Unless... than to bolt. Let's try something. Let's just... let's just not go.

797
03:30:07,979 --> 03:30:40,489
No. No, there it is. And just beyond Baylum will be Monstro Town. That was almost... uh-oh.

798
03:30:41,129 --> 03:30:55,879
Bowser's coming back for the Baylum fight. All right, so I need to put some Scarecrow

799
03:30:55,879 --> 03:31:25,899
repellent on. All right, uh, let's just... let's do this now. Let's get Mallow out of here

800
03:31:26,700 --> 03:31:35,239
for Bowser. Let's make sure somebody has a true form pin on. Mutant Poison. I don't have a true

801
03:31:35,239 --> 03:31:45,100
form. Who has the true form pin? Do you know? Let's give the true form pin to the person

802
03:31:45,100 --> 03:31:53,340
that needs it the most. The person that needs to be able to stay alive and heal everybody.

803
03:31:53,340 --> 03:32:13,430
Wait. You look so tasty. I think I'll have just a snack.

804
03:32:14,309 --> 03:32:38,219
Mm-hmm. Just keep it going. I'll never forget a taste. In fact, I can clone someone

805
03:32:38,219 --> 03:32:45,370
after just one slurp. Take a look. You all look so delicious. Well, how do you taste?

806
03:32:48,649 --> 03:33:10,979
Tastes peachy. There we are. No, I ain't gonna do it again.

807
03:33:12,500 --> 03:33:22,309
You all look so delicious. But how do you taste? See, the developers... there's a lot of controversy

808
03:33:22,309 --> 03:33:38,389
on when this happened. I didn't even do it. Come on, give me some slack. I ironically did it. I

809
03:33:38,389 --> 03:33:47,290
ironically did it. All right, I need to stop farming minus two. So this is going to be the

810
03:33:47,290 --> 03:34:21,579
lowest rated string of the year. They all sleep? Holy fuck, that was a lot. How do you taste?

811
03:34:22,299 --> 03:34:52,500
Always get rid of the clone first. How are we doing on health? Snap out of it. Somebody... okay,

812
03:34:52,579 --> 03:34:58,309
uh, we're fine. I have an able juice. I might as well just use it

813
03:34:58,309 --> 03:35:33,110
because I need you. Let's just do group hug. Do the ultra jump again. 240. God, keep eating

814
03:35:33,670 --> 03:35:53,370
peach. That's fine. How is it gonna kill peach in one hit? Do it again, Mario. You know what to do.

815
03:35:53,370 --> 03:36:13,829
One, two, three, six, seven, fifteen. No, not again. I'm starving. Time to go home for dinner.

816
03:36:14,709 --> 03:36:42,420
Goodbye, boys and girls. What am I... what is going on here? Trash loot. Yeah, yeah.

817
03:36:48,969 --> 03:36:58,069
Oh, hey. Hello again. That pipe is a shortcut to my house. Beautiful house. Monstro Town.

818
03:36:59,079 --> 03:37:13,420
I'll see you there. Monstro Town. I love Monstro Town. It's great.

819
03:37:13,420 --> 03:37:32,520
Weapon and armor shop. Just a minute. I'll be there in a second. Oh, my.

820
03:37:34,840 --> 03:37:41,590
Goomba, what are you doing here? Well, Bowser, it's been ages, hasn't it?

821
03:37:42,739 --> 03:37:47,700
Sorry about going haywire on you. I ran away because I was scared to fight Smitty.

822
03:37:48,760 --> 03:37:55,620
A lot has happened since then, but look how far I've come. I'm managing this store now. And look,

823
03:37:56,260 --> 03:38:07,430
here are my little ones. Come on, show your manners and greet Uncle Bowser. Although I can't

824
03:38:07,430 --> 03:38:13,030
fight for you, I still have some items we could use. Maybe you'd fight it in your heart to forgive

825
03:38:13,030 --> 03:38:25,079
me if I could help you get equipped. Don't worry. I'm not angry with you. I've got new troops now,

826
03:38:25,079 --> 03:38:30,440
and we're going to reclaim my castle. You can go on with your life here. I wish you the best.

827
03:38:31,319 --> 03:38:43,500
Well, I really appreciate that. What can I get you? Oh, you know what I'm getting here.

828
03:38:49,670 --> 03:39:18,549
Spiked Link Courage Shell. 155. Let's go. Courage Shell is... Magic Defense Down. What is it here?

829
03:39:19,350 --> 03:39:26,629
53. That's just... that's just not very good, but I kind of...

830
03:39:31,180 --> 03:39:37,819
How does Mario have 100 and fucking 50? No. He's 144 attack. Why does he suck?

831
03:39:38,780 --> 03:40:09,610
Give the amulet to Bowser. No, don't do that. I need some more of these. How many do I have?

832
03:40:10,329 --> 03:40:12,649
I have a lot of pick-me-ups. I'm never going to buy any more of these again.

833
03:40:13,610 --> 03:40:32,520
Okay. Nice to see you. Goodbye. Feel free to rest here. The Three Musty Fears. I remember this.

834
03:40:33,319 --> 03:40:53,770
Nice to meet you. I'm Grieper. I'm the Big Boo. And I'm Dry Bones. We are the Three Musty Fears.

835
03:40:57,420 --> 03:41:05,639
He's sleeping. Boy, he sure is. Check those bubbles coming out of his nose.

836
03:41:06,360 --> 03:41:16,389
Maybe he can still hear us while he's asleep. Hey, you. We want to play around and find the

837
03:41:16,469 --> 03:41:25,420
flag. Right. We'll each hide a flag somewhere around the world. Find all three flags,

838
03:41:26,219 --> 03:41:36,040
and you'll get an awesome prize. We'll go and hide the flag. See you when we get back. Dumbledore.

839
03:41:42,620 --> 03:41:47,340
I looked over and saw Dumbledore. I just... it was one comment that said Dumbledore,

840
03:41:47,340 --> 03:41:58,280
and I fucking lost my mind. They'll be back. Our first year students. They will show us

841
03:41:59,579 --> 03:42:08,420
very wonderful things. I'm back. I hid my flag behind a wooden flower. I know what that is.

842
03:42:08,420 --> 03:42:17,959
I'm home. My flag's under a green bed. I'm back. You'll never guess my spot. It's between

843
03:42:17,959 --> 03:42:25,059
O and an A. Ladies and gentlemen, the first flag is behind the wooden rose in Rosedown. The second

844
03:42:25,059 --> 03:42:30,579
flag is on Yoshi's Island between the O and the A of Goll, and the green bed, if you believe it

845
03:42:30,579 --> 03:42:49,219
or not, happens to be Super Mario's own green bed in his house. Did you know? Our flags are

846
03:42:49,219 --> 03:42:56,680
invisible, so search very carefully when you think you've found the spot, Harry. Don't forget what we

847
03:42:56,680 --> 03:43:18,920
told you. Go. Time it. Time right now. Start the time. No, wait. Start the time when I... wait.

848
03:43:20,069 --> 03:43:25,590
I'm not... why am I going this way? I'm going the wrong way. Hold on. Don't start that timer yet.

849
03:43:26,309 --> 03:44:10,790
Hold on. Where's the door? It's this door right here. Go. Reaper flag. Big Boo flag.

850
03:44:23,819 --> 03:44:38,280
What is that? It's not his name? His name's not Reaper? Dry Bones flag. All the flags got.

851
03:44:38,280 --> 03:45:21,290
Call it when I get back in the bed. And... time. Good job. You found all three flags. Hey, you're

852
03:45:21,290 --> 03:45:30,069
not half bad. You did pretty well. We had a great time, too. Thanks for playing our game. In fact,

853
03:45:30,149 --> 03:45:36,309
we just got off lunch and you did it. Not even. We were on our way to lunch and my phone buzzed.

854
03:45:36,309 --> 03:45:57,450
Who fucking helped you? The grand prize giveaway. Don't forget what we told you. What did I get?

855
03:46:01,540 --> 03:46:29,979
I got a great item bad smell. Where is it? Oh, there it is. Ghost medal. Raise his defense

856
03:46:29,979 --> 03:46:59,100
while attacking. Yup, yup, yup. Yup, yup, yup. Yup, yup. Yup. Yup. It's been sealed.

857
03:47:04,780 --> 03:47:10,469
So the super jump is your specialty, right? Those multiple jumps of yours are pretty amazing.

858
03:47:10,469 --> 03:47:16,729
I heard that your record for consecutive jumps stands at 12. How do you do it? Jump

859
03:47:16,729 --> 03:47:26,329
more than 30 times in a row and I'll give you a prize. You're a terrible. Rumor has it that you

860
03:47:26,329 --> 03:47:31,219
You're a quiet and accomplished jumper.

861
03:47:31,219 --> 03:47:33,739
I may be out-jumped, but you're totally out-pumped.

862
03:47:36,209 --> 03:47:38,069
A strong, silent type, eh?

863
03:47:40,409 --> 03:47:42,049
Don't you dig these vibes?

864
03:47:43,969 --> 03:47:47,250
Don't you dig these vibes?

865
03:47:47,250 --> 03:47:50,709
It's really weird sometimes I hear the guy next door.

866
03:47:50,709 --> 03:47:54,799
He's always mumbling about a crystal in evil.

867
03:47:54,799 --> 03:47:58,079
Isn't a crystal some kind of shiny rock or something?

868
03:47:58,079 --> 03:48:18,829
I know I've seen those somewhere.

869
03:48:18,829 --> 03:48:22,930
Oh my, a traveler from afar.

870
03:48:22,969 --> 03:48:26,049
Welcome to Monstro Town, where many of our kind mingle.

871
03:48:26,049 --> 03:48:32,389
I'm the landlady, you monster, I'm a,

872
03:48:32,389 --> 03:48:34,469
a star, you say?

873
03:48:34,469 --> 03:48:37,739
Oh, you're here to see our star.

874
03:48:37,739 --> 03:48:39,399
She's upstairs.

875
03:48:39,399 --> 03:48:51,680
So feel free to go and take a look for yourself.

876
03:48:51,680 --> 03:48:54,719
Sometimes if you jump in the right places,

877
03:48:54,719 --> 03:48:58,620
a treasure box will pop out of thin air.

878
03:48:58,620 --> 03:49:01,069
Anything like this ever happen to you?

879
03:49:01,069 --> 03:49:04,190
These treasure boxes are known as surprise boxes

880
03:49:04,190 --> 03:49:07,180
because they appear out of nowhere.

881
03:49:08,020 --> 03:49:14,799
They didn't get found of all, but there are still 32 left.

882
03:49:14,799 --> 03:49:19,229
I've been all around the world, almost every country,

883
03:49:19,229 --> 03:49:21,399
but the strangest person I met

884
03:49:21,399 --> 03:49:24,139
is this old geezer in Rosedown.

885
03:49:24,139 --> 03:49:40,200
He's really weird, but definitely worth meeting.

886
03:49:40,200 --> 03:49:48,000
That's the song, that's the Todofsky song.

887
03:49:48,000 --> 03:50:06,829
Dun, dun, dun, dun, somebody screenshot that, okay.

888
03:50:06,829 --> 03:50:07,670
So what do you think?

889
03:50:07,670 --> 03:50:09,670
Our star is adorable.

890
03:50:09,670 --> 03:50:11,590
She's so talented too.

891
03:50:11,590 --> 03:50:14,639
Folks come to see her from afar.

892
03:50:15,399 --> 03:50:18,760
Geez, starbees?

893
03:50:18,760 --> 03:50:22,420
Oh, starpiece, I'm not familiar with it.

894
03:50:22,420 --> 03:50:25,579
So you came all the way out here to search for a starpiece.

895
03:50:25,579 --> 03:50:27,620
Must be really important.

896
03:50:27,620 --> 03:50:29,620
This is the last place on the land.

897
03:50:29,620 --> 03:50:33,649
If you can't find it here, then the only place left is up.

898
03:50:33,649 --> 03:50:35,629
What?

899
03:50:35,629 --> 03:50:37,590
So you wanna go up there?

900
03:50:37,590 --> 03:50:39,489
Oh, you're an open book.

901
03:50:39,489 --> 03:50:41,030
Okay, here's what you need to do.

902
03:50:41,030 --> 03:50:44,190
There's a secret passage to the sky had been valid,

903
03:50:44,190 --> 03:50:46,510
but first you must scale the cliff beyond the desert

904
03:50:46,510 --> 03:50:47,790
to get there.

905
03:50:47,790 --> 03:50:49,350
Since you're such a nice guy,

906
03:50:49,350 --> 03:50:54,319
I clearly introduce you to someone that can help you.

907
03:50:54,319 --> 03:51:05,819
Sky troopers, I need you.

908
03:51:05,819 --> 03:51:08,799
What was our flying time, troops?

909
03:51:08,799 --> 03:51:14,090
8.52 seconds, Sergeant.

910
03:51:14,090 --> 03:51:16,440
Sky troopers reporting for duty.

911
03:51:16,440 --> 03:51:19,239
Ask me anything.

912
03:51:19,239 --> 03:51:22,200
We are 0.52 seconds late.

913
03:51:22,200 --> 03:51:28,540
I hold myself personally accountable for the delay, ma'am.

914
03:51:28,540 --> 03:51:31,780
Still as rigid as ever about your rules and regulations.

915
03:51:31,780 --> 03:51:35,180
No need to bother with the protocol around me, Sergeant.

916
03:51:35,180 --> 03:51:38,620
I've got a favor to ask of you.

917
03:51:38,620 --> 03:51:39,459
Yes, ma'am.

918
03:51:39,459 --> 03:51:42,180
Anything we can do for a civilian.

919
03:51:42,180 --> 03:51:43,540
This fellow here really wants to,

920
03:51:43,540 --> 03:51:46,629
really wants to get to Bean Valley.

921
03:51:46,629 --> 03:51:50,379
Could you help him scale the cliff?

922
03:51:50,379 --> 03:51:51,459
Understood, ma'am.

923
03:51:51,459 --> 03:51:54,100
The orders are get mustache over the cliff.

924
03:51:54,100 --> 03:51:56,649
We will succeed.

925
03:51:56,649 --> 03:51:59,530
We will now deploy ourselves to the cliff it lands in.

926
03:51:59,530 --> 03:52:05,149
Troopers, keep a tight formation.

927
03:52:05,149 --> 03:52:10,000
We have liftoff.

928
03:52:10,000 --> 03:52:12,440
They're odd, but trustworthy.

929
03:52:12,440 --> 03:52:15,959
Good luck with your search.

930
03:52:15,959 --> 03:52:17,579
Hope you find your star.

931
03:52:25,409 --> 03:52:29,750
No, no, react harder.

932
03:52:29,750 --> 03:52:32,829
React harder.

933
03:52:32,829 --> 03:52:50,100
Turn him off.

934
03:52:50,100 --> 03:52:51,100
No, it's not down yet.

935
03:52:54,799 --> 03:52:58,639
Don't you dig these vibes.

936
03:52:58,639 --> 03:52:59,760
Don't you dig these vibes.

937
03:52:59,760 --> 03:53:01,040
Is it down?

938
03:53:01,040 --> 03:53:02,000
Another little tip for you.

939
03:53:02,000 --> 03:53:02,879
That's how you get the key.

940
03:53:02,879 --> 03:53:04,100
Got the temple key.

941
03:53:05,000 --> 03:53:06,040
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

942
03:53:06,040 --> 03:53:06,879
I did.

943
03:53:06,879 --> 03:53:08,159
I have it.

944
03:53:08,159 --> 03:53:09,000
I do.

945
03:53:10,770 --> 03:53:13,190
What the fuck am I doing?

946
03:53:13,190 --> 03:53:14,659
Okay.

947
03:53:14,659 --> 03:53:18,299
Now I'm going to go up here

948
03:53:18,299 --> 03:53:21,959
to meet the best character in the game.

949
03:53:21,959 --> 03:53:24,180
Not this guy.

950
03:53:24,180 --> 03:53:25,979
Who is it?

951
03:53:26,020 --> 03:53:29,450
Sorry, but the Sensei's not in.

952
03:53:29,450 --> 03:53:31,690
Oh my God.

953
03:53:31,690 --> 03:53:35,350
Ha ha, oh my God.

954
03:53:35,350 --> 03:53:39,420
Jagger?

955
03:53:39,420 --> 03:53:43,059
Bowser, I haven't seen you for so long.

956
03:53:43,059 --> 03:53:44,399
I've been studying here at the Dojo

957
03:53:44,399 --> 03:53:47,010
under the Sensei jinx because,

958
03:53:47,010 --> 03:53:48,049
to tell you the truth,

959
03:53:48,049 --> 03:53:50,719
I knew I couldn't beat Smitty.

960
03:53:50,719 --> 03:53:52,219
That's why I'm here now.

961
03:53:52,219 --> 03:53:58,219
Someday I'm going to return and make you proud.

962
03:53:58,219 --> 03:54:00,120
Don't worry about me.

963
03:54:00,120 --> 03:54:02,389
I've got two new troopers now

964
03:54:02,389 --> 03:54:04,649
and we're going to take back my castle.

965
03:54:04,649 --> 03:54:05,989
You stick to your guns.

966
03:54:06,829 --> 03:54:11,680
Train like there's no tomorrow.

967
03:54:11,680 --> 03:54:14,600
My Sensei's out right now, but he'll be back shortly.

968
03:54:14,600 --> 03:54:19,200
In the meantime, will you accept a challenge from me?

969
03:54:19,200 --> 03:54:20,399
Sure.

970
03:54:20,399 --> 03:54:21,239
Okay, great.

971
03:54:21,239 --> 03:54:22,059
Nice.

972
03:54:22,059 --> 03:54:23,719
You know that I'm not going to make it easy for you though,

973
03:54:23,719 --> 03:54:36,719
right?

974
03:54:36,719 --> 03:54:38,120
Bang, bang, bang.

975
03:54:38,120 --> 03:54:42,250
Oh, that hurts my eyes.

976
03:54:42,250 --> 03:54:56,180
Every time I attack with Bowser now.

977
03:54:56,180 --> 03:55:06,840
Oh, no, that sucks.

978
03:55:06,840 --> 03:55:09,149
Terror punch.

979
03:55:09,149 --> 03:55:14,989
Dead.

980
03:55:14,989 --> 03:55:16,959
I found the solution.

981
03:55:16,959 --> 03:55:19,079
Every time it goes,

982
03:55:19,120 --> 03:55:20,040
just close your eyes,

983
03:55:20,040 --> 03:55:22,520
just hard blink and you won't see it.

984
03:55:22,520 --> 03:55:24,360
So just go blink, blink, blink,

985
03:55:24,360 --> 03:55:25,940
and you won't see at all.

986
03:55:25,940 --> 03:55:33,930
That's what I'm going to do.

987
03:55:33,930 --> 03:55:34,969
Yikes.

988
03:55:34,969 --> 03:55:37,500
I guess that was to be expected.

989
03:55:37,500 --> 03:55:42,659
Mario, you're a top-notch fighter.

990
03:55:42,659 --> 03:55:49,479
You did well for your inexperience, Jago.

991
03:55:49,479 --> 03:55:53,559
Sensei, have you been here all along?

992
03:55:53,559 --> 03:55:55,100
Hmm.

993
03:55:55,100 --> 03:55:57,659
You felt my ki, didn't you?

994
03:55:57,659 --> 03:55:59,100
Not bad for a novice.

995
03:56:04,590 --> 03:56:05,799
No.

996
03:56:05,799 --> 03:56:09,360
Your fighting style isn't as foolproof as you think.

997
03:56:11,069 --> 03:56:24,950
I'll accept a challenge any day.

998
03:56:24,950 --> 03:56:31,719
You wish to challenge me?

999
03:56:31,719 --> 03:56:41,239
All right, let's see what you're capable of.

1000
03:56:41,239 --> 03:56:42,079
All right, here's the strategy.

1001
03:56:42,079 --> 03:56:45,329
Ready?

1002
03:56:45,329 --> 03:56:46,149
Block now.

1003
03:56:46,149 --> 03:56:46,989
Yep.

1004
03:56:46,989 --> 03:56:47,829
That does a lot of damage.

1005
03:56:47,829 --> 03:56:50,360
You have to block right when you can hit the ground.

1006
03:56:50,360 --> 03:56:52,079
Got it.

1007
03:56:52,079 --> 03:56:52,899
All right, ready?

1008
03:56:52,899 --> 03:57:20,329
So blink, blink, blink.

1009
03:57:20,329 --> 03:57:22,420
Triple kick.

1010
03:57:22,420 --> 03:57:23,260
Block.

1011
03:57:23,260 --> 03:57:24,899
I remember these timings.

1012
03:57:25,219 --> 03:57:31,719
They were really annoying to get used to.

1013
03:57:31,719 --> 03:57:33,079
Shit does so much damage though.

1014
03:57:33,079 --> 03:57:34,000
I have to keep using it.

1015
03:57:34,000 --> 03:57:35,040
I'm sorry.

1016
03:57:35,040 --> 03:57:38,000
Actual real, like no jokes at all.

1017
03:57:38,000 --> 03:57:39,840
Like if you're sensitive to flashes of light and stuff,

1018
03:57:39,840 --> 03:57:41,879
like that's going to happen for a while.

1019
03:57:41,879 --> 03:57:56,770
So seriously though, like take care of yourself, right?

1020
03:57:56,770 --> 03:58:00,600
Battle her up.

1021
03:58:00,600 --> 03:58:03,670
Oh shit.

1022
03:58:03,670 --> 03:58:14,479
I need her.

1023
03:58:14,479 --> 03:58:20,079
Six.

1024
03:58:20,079 --> 03:58:22,639
Again.

1025
03:58:22,639 --> 03:58:24,319
You don't get to go twice.

1026
03:58:24,319 --> 03:58:37,680
That's not fair.

1027
03:58:37,680 --> 03:58:38,520
Group hug.

1028
03:58:45,180 --> 03:58:52,959
Woo hoo.

1029
03:58:52,959 --> 03:59:00,479
Simply amazing.

1030
03:59:00,479 --> 03:59:02,520
I guess I underestimated you.

1031
03:59:02,520 --> 03:59:04,479
You packed quite a punch,

1032
03:59:04,479 --> 03:59:06,479
but don't let it go to your head

1033
03:59:06,479 --> 03:59:09,680
because I had let you have that round.

1034
03:59:09,680 --> 03:59:15,379
Let's have a rematch.

1035
03:59:15,379 --> 03:59:24,940
This becomes very, very, very hard.

1036
03:59:24,940 --> 03:59:27,899
All right, you asked for it and no crying if you get hurt.

1037
03:59:27,899 --> 03:59:38,600
Quick silver.

1038
03:59:38,600 --> 03:59:48,719
He missed.

1039
03:59:48,719 --> 03:59:49,559
Good block.

1040
03:59:49,559 --> 03:59:52,739
And even if that would have been a one hit kill.

1041
03:59:52,739 --> 04:00:03,479
You see, you see what I'm up against here?

1042
04:00:03,520 --> 04:00:06,120
That was a gamer Jupiter?

1043
04:00:06,120 --> 04:00:07,520
What the heck are you talking about?

1044
04:00:07,520 --> 04:00:08,520
Oh my fucking God.

1045
04:00:08,520 --> 04:00:15,649
I looked at, let me re-chat and take a hundred damage.

1046
04:00:15,649 --> 04:00:21,020
Yeah, I'm a little under level for this part.

1047
04:00:21,020 --> 04:00:27,860
I still might be able to do it though.

1048
04:00:27,860 --> 04:00:30,780
There's a third phase that you actually need to be

1049
04:00:30,780 --> 04:00:33,379
like at least level 15 to 20 to do it.

1050
04:00:33,379 --> 04:00:49,219
Cause he will just kill you.

1051
04:00:49,219 --> 04:00:51,440
Zero.

1052
04:00:51,440 --> 04:00:59,899
Well, well.

1053
04:00:59,899 --> 04:01:02,469
Just perfect block every time.

1054
04:01:02,469 --> 04:01:04,590
I mean, that's true, but you still take damage.

1055
04:01:04,590 --> 04:01:12,129
And yeah, he has a move that instantly kills somebody.

1056
04:01:12,129 --> 04:01:15,290
That move quick silver, I believe is a guaranteed kill.

1057
04:01:15,290 --> 04:01:24,850
Or it brings you down to one.

1058
04:01:24,850 --> 04:01:26,569
You can see me through a telescope.

1059
04:01:28,579 --> 04:01:34,940
Well, I hope you're enjoying fucking space.

1060
04:01:34,940 --> 04:01:47,350
I missed it.

1061
04:01:47,350 --> 04:01:50,340
Didn't even need to do that, but I did it anyways.

1062
04:01:50,340 --> 04:01:51,899
All right, here we go, phase two.

1063
04:01:51,899 --> 04:02:05,780
I'm gonna do like 10 damage to him now.

1064
04:02:05,780 --> 04:02:10,760
Fuck man, that is actually bothering me.

1065
04:02:10,760 --> 04:02:15,989
Blocked it.

1066
04:02:15,989 --> 04:02:19,110
I really am trying to time the blinks and it's working,

1067
04:02:19,110 --> 04:02:25,469
but I might have to get rid of Bowser for a little while.

1068
04:02:25,469 --> 04:02:48,389
You know what I'm saying?

1069
04:02:48,389 --> 04:03:10,549
We're gonna have to use him as parts.

1070
04:03:10,549 --> 04:03:22,170
31.

1071
04:03:22,170 --> 04:03:26,520
Miss.

1072
04:03:26,520 --> 04:03:27,959
64 damage.

1073
04:03:27,959 --> 04:03:32,399
What the fuck?

1074
04:03:32,399 --> 04:03:35,670
That really angers me.

1075
04:03:35,670 --> 04:03:47,260
That really makes me upset about that.

1076
04:03:47,260 --> 04:04:00,159
Oh, this simply amazing.

1077
04:04:00,159 --> 04:04:03,399
I simply just can't believe.

1078
04:04:03,399 --> 04:04:05,440
Still haven't had enough.

1079
04:04:05,440 --> 04:04:09,360
It isn't often that I have someone this competitive to spar with.

1080
04:04:09,360 --> 04:04:10,520
All right.

1081
04:04:10,520 --> 04:04:12,799
This match will be the one that counts.

1082
04:04:12,799 --> 04:04:23,299
Since I'm placing my reputation on the line.

1083
04:04:23,299 --> 04:04:26,239
I'll go for it.

1084
04:04:26,239 --> 04:04:30,680
I need a better team though.

1085
04:04:30,680 --> 04:04:32,079
Sorry Bowser, you gotta go.

1086
04:04:32,079 --> 04:04:40,020
Like I just can't look at that anymore.

1087
04:04:40,020 --> 04:04:41,739
I need a, no, no, no, no.

1088
04:04:41,739 --> 04:04:43,819
I can't, I'm not ready.

1089
04:04:43,819 --> 04:04:45,299
I'm not ready.

1090
04:04:45,299 --> 04:04:46,139
I'll be back.

1091
04:04:46,139 --> 04:04:58,870
I'm not ready.

1092
04:04:58,870 --> 04:05:13,180
Where the hell am I going?

1093
04:05:13,180 --> 04:05:15,719
Lands in.

1094
04:05:15,719 --> 04:05:16,559
I'm gonna go back.

1095
04:05:16,559 --> 04:05:19,799
Oh wait, just, I need a few more levels.

1096
04:05:19,799 --> 04:05:32,809
I need a few more levels.

1097
04:05:32,809 --> 04:05:35,920
And I did say I was gonna remove Bowser.

1098
04:05:35,920 --> 04:05:37,940
And I did.

1099
04:05:37,940 --> 04:05:43,719
I'm pretty smart.

1100
04:05:43,719 --> 04:05:48,069
Now go to the equip section.

1101
04:05:48,069 --> 04:05:52,190
We need the work pants and the ghost medal from you Bowser.

1102
04:05:52,190 --> 04:05:55,399
Thanks.

1103
04:05:55,399 --> 04:05:58,129
We've got the double punch on.

1104
04:05:58,129 --> 04:06:01,290
Work pants and the ghost medal.

1105
04:06:13,879 --> 04:06:27,579
Out there.

1106
04:06:27,579 --> 04:06:29,379
Do I need a break?

1107
04:06:29,379 --> 04:06:32,680
Um, I'm good.

1108
04:06:32,680 --> 04:06:36,139
I'm good guys.

1109
04:06:36,139 --> 04:06:39,819
I ate a piece of salmon earlier.

1110
04:06:39,819 --> 04:06:40,819
I could literally,

1111
04:06:40,819 --> 04:07:01,049
I could literally lift up a car right now.

1112
04:07:01,049 --> 04:07:02,969
There's gotta be, I don't remember.

1113
04:07:35,319 --> 04:07:38,040
Caution, confused monster.

1114
04:07:39,579 --> 04:07:40,420
The yellow one.

1115
04:07:40,420 --> 04:07:58,159
Don't hit me.

1116
04:07:58,159 --> 04:07:59,000
What does it mean?

1117
04:07:59,000 --> 04:07:59,819
What does it mean no balls?

1118
04:07:59,819 --> 04:08:01,000
What are we talking about?

1119
04:08:01,000 --> 04:08:07,229
What's going on with you guys?

1120
04:08:07,229 --> 04:08:10,110
That was an incredible room.

1121
04:08:11,399 --> 04:08:12,600
I don't want to fight that.

1122
04:08:12,600 --> 04:08:29,659
Get out of the way.

1123
04:08:29,659 --> 04:08:41,569
I hate this.

1124
04:08:41,690 --> 04:08:45,500
Ah.

1125
04:08:45,500 --> 04:08:46,340
Gino Blast.

1126
04:08:46,340 --> 04:08:56,959
Here we go.

1127
04:08:56,959 --> 04:08:57,799
And that, ladies and gentlemen,

1128
04:08:57,799 --> 04:09:06,659
is why Gino is best character in the game.

1129
04:09:06,659 --> 04:09:13,840
Toaster learns mute.

1130
04:09:13,840 --> 04:09:15,760
And he still has one more move for Gino Flash.

1131
04:09:15,760 --> 04:09:20,280
Gino Blast, Gino World, Gino Boost.

1132
04:09:20,280 --> 04:09:25,040
We're talking about standard B, side B, down B, up B,

1133
04:09:25,040 --> 04:09:26,479
final smash.

1134
04:09:26,479 --> 04:09:28,200
Get on it, Nintendo.

1135
04:09:28,200 --> 04:09:29,680
He's made for that game.

1136
04:09:29,680 --> 04:10:00,049
That's the only reason why he made this long ago.

1137
04:10:00,049 --> 04:10:09,360
67.

1138
04:10:09,399 --> 04:10:10,239
More frog coins?

1139
04:10:10,239 --> 04:10:33,229
Can I accumulate more frog coins?

1140
04:10:33,229 --> 04:10:52,620
Yeah, let's double it up.

1141
04:10:52,620 --> 04:10:56,770
Double it up.

1142
04:10:56,770 --> 04:10:58,290
Four more frog coins.

1143
04:10:58,290 --> 04:11:00,979
You can farm frog coins here.

1144
04:11:00,979 --> 04:11:13,549
That'd be pretty sick.

1145
04:11:13,549 --> 04:11:18,299
Four frog coins.

1146
04:11:18,299 --> 04:11:19,620
Here we go.

1147
04:11:19,620 --> 04:11:21,620
Let's climb the mountain.

1148
04:11:28,079 --> 04:11:31,600
Which way is it again?

1149
04:11:31,600 --> 04:11:37,950
Which way is it again?

1150
04:11:37,950 --> 04:11:39,469
Over this way.

1151
04:11:39,469 --> 04:11:44,530
I think it is.

1152
04:11:44,530 --> 04:11:49,260
Over this way, I think.

1153
04:11:49,260 --> 04:11:50,100
There it is.

1154
04:11:50,100 --> 04:11:57,360
Okay.

1155
04:11:57,360 --> 04:11:58,180
Ten Hut.

1156
04:11:58,180 --> 04:12:00,100
All troops in positions.

1157
04:12:00,100 --> 04:12:01,860
Mario, your mission is to scale the cliff

1158
04:12:01,860 --> 04:12:21,379
by jumping shell to shell.

1159
04:12:21,379 --> 04:12:22,219
Don't give up.

1160
04:12:22,219 --> 04:12:23,059
Sure and steady does it.

1161
04:12:23,059 --> 04:12:24,969
Try it again.

1162
04:12:24,969 --> 04:12:25,809
It's timed, by the way.

1163
04:12:25,809 --> 04:12:43,850
That's why I'm doing this.

1164
04:12:43,850 --> 04:12:45,129
I can't get on that one.

1165
04:12:45,129 --> 04:12:57,579
I know I can.

1166
04:12:57,579 --> 04:12:58,420
I know you can skip one.

1167
04:12:58,420 --> 04:13:05,979
Maybe you can't.

1168
04:13:05,979 --> 04:13:36,950
Oh my God.

1169
04:13:36,950 --> 04:13:37,770
That's a pretty good time.

1170
04:13:37,770 --> 04:13:38,610
Mission accomplished.

1171
04:13:38,610 --> 04:13:52,129
Last time, 13.9 seconds.

1172
04:13:52,129 --> 04:13:53,090
Let me do 12 seconds.

1173
04:13:53,090 --> 04:14:03,959
Shit.

1174
04:14:03,959 --> 04:14:04,780
Ah, that was close.

1175
04:14:04,780 --> 04:14:08,299
Again.

1176
04:14:08,299 --> 04:14:19,649
That could have been probably 10 seconds.

1177
04:14:19,649 --> 04:14:21,049
I'm hitting the shell over there.

1178
04:14:21,049 --> 04:14:35,719
Get out of here.

1179
04:14:35,719 --> 04:14:36,559
I don't care.

1180
04:14:36,559 --> 04:14:37,379
I got the frog coin.

1181
04:14:37,379 --> 04:15:05,590
Who gives a shit?

1182
04:15:05,590 --> 04:15:06,430
Let's go.

1183
04:15:06,430 --> 04:15:07,409
Ooh.

1184
04:15:07,409 --> 04:15:09,559
That's gonna be good.

1185
04:15:09,559 --> 04:15:11,280
Distinguishing work, soldier.

1186
04:15:11,280 --> 04:15:12,260
Here's the next best thing.

1187
04:15:12,260 --> 04:15:17,149
A Troopa pin.

1188
04:15:17,149 --> 04:15:20,600
Got it.

1189
04:15:20,600 --> 04:15:24,389
Grants Troopa confidence.

1190
04:15:24,389 --> 04:15:33,399
Sure does.

1191
04:15:33,399 --> 04:15:40,360
But what does that mean?

1192
04:15:40,360 --> 04:15:54,719
What does that mean?

1193
04:15:54,719 --> 04:16:04,799
Beanvale.

1194
04:16:04,799 --> 04:16:07,629
It's 20 speed, is it?

1195
04:16:07,629 --> 04:16:09,270
What is the speed stat even for?

1196
04:16:09,270 --> 04:16:21,760
Missing when somebody misses you?

1197
04:16:21,760 --> 04:16:22,680
You hate this song.

1198
04:16:22,680 --> 04:16:23,520
Why?

1199
04:16:23,520 --> 04:16:27,370
This is a great song.

1200
04:16:27,370 --> 04:16:31,200
Wait.

1201
04:16:31,200 --> 04:16:53,700
Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.

1202
04:16:53,700 --> 04:16:54,540
Time for a nap.

1203
04:17:01,750 --> 04:17:02,750
Aim sucks.

1204
04:17:02,750 --> 04:17:04,950
Am I actually seeing game sucks?

1205
04:17:04,950 --> 04:17:06,510
I don't believe it.

1206
04:17:06,510 --> 04:17:08,229
No, you're not actually doing that.

1207
04:17:17,540 --> 04:17:23,989
That this is, this is the Michael Jordan of video games.

1208
04:17:23,989 --> 04:17:27,430
What, really?

1209
04:17:27,430 --> 04:17:41,620
Crusher.

1210
04:17:41,620 --> 04:17:42,719
So overrated.

1211
04:17:47,040 --> 04:17:49,760
You're actually talking about one of the best NBA players

1212
04:17:49,760 --> 04:17:55,049
to ever live.

1213
04:17:55,049 --> 04:18:08,979
Overrated.

1214
04:18:08,979 --> 04:18:16,110
I'd be more invested if you did playthroughs of Paper Mario.

1215
04:18:16,110 --> 04:18:22,440
This is, this is, this is, this is Paper Mario.

1216
04:18:22,799 --> 04:18:25,319
The only difference is it's like real game

1217
04:18:25,319 --> 04:18:27,079
that came out before Paper Mario.

1218
04:18:27,079 --> 04:18:32,120
You are playing Paper Mario's father.

1219
04:18:32,120 --> 04:18:36,709
Paper Mario's dad.

1220
04:18:36,709 --> 04:18:39,229
Everything that Paper Mario learned from dad,

1221
04:18:39,229 --> 04:18:46,690
he learned from his dad.

1222
04:18:46,690 --> 04:19:14,180
In fact, some would argue that dad was a little quicker.

1223
04:19:14,180 --> 04:19:17,100
Fighting over what is better.

1224
04:19:17,100 --> 04:19:22,409
They're all on the same team.

1225
04:19:22,409 --> 04:19:23,850
You're on the same team.

1226
04:19:31,649 --> 04:19:34,969
Otter Fiend, thanks for the five community subs, Otter.

1227
04:19:34,969 --> 04:19:37,450
Dropping five subs here, thank you.

1228
04:19:37,450 --> 04:19:40,680
Appreciate it.

1229
04:19:40,680 --> 04:19:45,680
Five community subs.

1230
04:19:45,680 --> 04:19:48,280
I remember something about this.

1231
04:19:48,280 --> 04:19:49,860
This is important.

1232
04:19:49,860 --> 04:19:50,700
This is important.

1233
04:19:50,700 --> 04:19:52,700
Something important here.

1234
04:19:52,700 --> 04:19:57,260
With either the, something here.

1235
04:19:57,260 --> 04:19:59,059
Something here, there's something here.

1236
04:19:59,059 --> 04:20:02,870
It's very important for something.

1237
04:20:02,870 --> 04:20:19,860
The seed, something.

1238
04:20:19,860 --> 04:20:23,020
There's an item that I need to pick up here.

1239
04:20:23,020 --> 04:20:25,959
I just forget what it is.

1240
04:20:25,959 --> 04:20:28,600
And it's the most important thing in the whole game.

1241
04:20:28,600 --> 04:20:30,000
That is a 200 fucking name.

1242
04:20:40,120 --> 04:20:41,579
Damn it.

1243
04:20:41,579 --> 04:20:42,399
Damn it.

1244
04:20:42,399 --> 04:20:48,739
I can't ever get that again.

1245
04:20:48,739 --> 04:20:51,290
It's in one of these.

1246
04:20:51,290 --> 04:21:20,069
I can't screw this up.

1247
04:21:20,069 --> 04:21:25,579
Mods to the rescue, what was going on?

1248
04:21:25,579 --> 04:21:26,659
Everybody just chill.

1249
04:21:38,040 --> 04:21:54,299
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

1250
04:21:54,299 --> 04:21:58,260
Now I'm not gonna do the Sans voice.

1251
04:21:58,260 --> 04:22:02,299
I'm sorry, but I'm not doing the Sans voice anymore

1252
04:22:02,299 --> 04:22:03,579
because of this.

1253
04:22:03,579 --> 04:22:08,579
I saw some, we apparently had an issue in the chat room

1254
04:22:08,620 --> 04:22:30,760
here and I told you guys to behave.

1255
04:22:30,760 --> 04:22:34,729
Punish us all.

1256
04:22:34,729 --> 04:22:36,790
All right, is this the, this is it, this is it.

1257
04:22:36,790 --> 04:22:41,059
All right, something happens here.

1258
04:22:41,059 --> 04:22:43,729
That's what happens here.

1259
04:22:43,729 --> 04:22:55,360
Shouldn't have known.

1260
04:22:55,360 --> 04:23:01,159
That's a lot of damage.

1261
04:23:01,159 --> 04:23:02,000
Are we on health?

1262
04:23:02,000 --> 04:23:03,889
We're okay.

1263
04:23:03,889 --> 04:23:05,250
Mute.

1264
04:23:05,250 --> 04:23:06,209
What is that?

1265
04:23:06,209 --> 04:23:07,090
What can I do with that?

1266
04:23:07,090 --> 04:23:11,690
Mute.

1267
04:23:11,690 --> 04:23:31,879
Will this work?

1268
04:23:31,879 --> 04:23:54,469
420, Jesus.

1269
04:23:54,510 --> 04:24:20,780
Mute that motherfucker right now.

1270
04:24:20,780 --> 04:24:23,430
There it is.

1271
04:24:23,430 --> 04:24:29,549
Ooh, that's it.

1272
04:24:29,549 --> 04:24:33,139
Group hug time.

1273
04:24:33,139 --> 04:24:34,899
Mario's a god now.

1274
04:24:34,899 --> 04:24:49,940
Yeah, Mario's a god now.

1275
04:24:49,940 --> 04:24:54,110
150, goodbye.

1276
04:24:54,110 --> 04:24:59,030
150 coins and you got a nothing.

1277
04:25:00,659 --> 04:25:02,680
You got nothing.

1278
04:25:02,680 --> 04:25:06,200
There's something, frog coin, there's something in here.

1279
04:25:06,200 --> 04:25:08,319
I think this is some, there's a secret in here.

1280
04:25:08,319 --> 04:25:10,719
I know there's something going on in this one.

1281
04:25:15,739 --> 04:25:16,579
That's not it.

1282
04:25:27,899 --> 04:25:29,379
Maybe I'll see it soon.

1283
04:25:38,719 --> 04:25:39,959
Free Wonka bar?

1284
04:25:43,149 --> 04:25:44,790
You can't get Wonka bars anymore.

1285
04:25:46,389 --> 04:25:48,829
I don't know why they ever decided that that was a good idea.

1286
04:25:48,829 --> 04:26:06,930
Cause they're awesome.

1287
04:26:06,930 --> 04:26:09,329
Yeah, some company bought them up and liquidated them.

1288
04:26:09,329 --> 04:26:13,190
All right, here's Mario.

1289
04:26:13,190 --> 04:26:15,399
Pretty good.

1290
04:26:15,399 --> 04:26:29,049
What do you guys think?

1291
04:26:29,049 --> 04:26:33,899
Why even do it?

1292
04:26:33,899 --> 04:26:46,209
Gino's attack is actually getting really, really good.

1293
04:26:46,209 --> 04:26:49,459
50% clicking on the right flower.

1294
04:26:49,459 --> 04:26:59,299
Nice.

1295
04:26:59,340 --> 04:27:02,340
Power on Gino.

1296
04:27:02,340 --> 04:27:03,420
All right.

1297
04:27:03,420 --> 04:27:05,979
I'm so happy that 31% of you clicked the flower

1298
04:27:05,979 --> 04:27:20,670
cause that's a good choice.

1299
04:27:20,670 --> 04:27:39,180
Let's go.

1300
04:27:39,180 --> 04:27:53,190
100%, you're morphing together.

1301
04:27:53,190 --> 04:27:54,309
This is it, this is it, this is it.

1302
04:27:54,309 --> 04:27:55,149
What do I do?

1303
04:27:55,149 --> 04:27:58,100
Okay, so you do something, that's the golden,

1304
04:27:58,100 --> 04:28:01,020
that's the golden, that's the golden thing.

1305
04:28:01,899 --> 04:28:02,860
I found it.

1306
04:28:02,860 --> 04:28:04,100
Now I forget what you do with this.

1307
04:28:04,100 --> 04:28:06,399
I think, you don't kill it.

1308
04:28:06,399 --> 04:28:07,239
What do you do to this?

1309
04:28:07,239 --> 04:28:23,549
This is the casino.

1310
04:28:23,549 --> 04:28:36,440
I forget what you do.

1311
04:28:36,440 --> 04:28:54,479
Uh oh, forget to kill these.

1312
04:28:54,479 --> 04:28:59,709
I think you do.

1313
04:28:59,709 --> 04:29:01,870
Whatever, I think you do.

1314
04:29:01,870 --> 04:29:11,950
And they drop something.

1315
04:29:11,950 --> 04:29:23,049
Hold on, I forget.

1316
04:29:23,049 --> 04:29:48,739
I actually am cheating right now, but that's fine.

1317
04:29:48,739 --> 04:29:50,100
I know, I know how you do it now.

1318
04:29:50,100 --> 04:29:53,129
I know how you do it.

1319
04:29:53,129 --> 04:29:54,610
I gotta go back to Booster's Tower.

1320
04:29:54,610 --> 04:29:55,610
Yeah, I remember this part.

1321
04:29:55,610 --> 04:29:58,290
I'm gonna, you guys are gonna laugh at me for this.

1322
04:29:58,290 --> 04:30:20,579
I'm gonna fuck this up a million times.

1323
04:30:20,579 --> 04:30:22,379
Remember, it's this one up here.

1324
04:30:22,379 --> 04:30:46,940
Oh, you idiot.

1325
04:30:46,940 --> 04:30:55,899
Hello.

1326
04:30:55,899 --> 04:30:58,500
Once again, nope, attack up.

1327
04:30:58,500 --> 04:30:59,500
They're vote kicking me.

1328
04:30:59,500 --> 04:31:00,780
They're vote kicking me.

1329
04:31:02,940 --> 04:31:03,780
What do I do?

1330
04:31:03,780 --> 04:31:05,579
What am I supposed to do?

1331
04:31:05,579 --> 04:31:08,620
I can't get kicked out of my own stream.

1332
04:31:08,620 --> 04:31:25,489
This is my stream.

1333
04:31:25,489 --> 04:31:31,000
What did that do?

1334
04:31:31,000 --> 04:31:38,129
Did I not get it?

1335
04:31:38,129 --> 04:31:40,700
All right, it is time.

1336
04:31:40,700 --> 04:32:05,370
Let's just attack you.

1337
04:32:05,370 --> 04:32:11,719
Vote kick, vote kick, vote kick.

1338
04:32:11,719 --> 04:32:14,840
Last time I was vote kicked from a server,

1339
04:32:14,840 --> 04:32:19,840
I think it was when Grandpa played CSGO jailbreak.

1340
04:32:22,569 --> 04:32:26,739
I think this is the last time it's ever happened.

1341
04:32:26,739 --> 04:32:30,340
I made everybody sing, and I didn't like how they sung.

1342
04:32:30,340 --> 04:32:35,059
So I just dropped everybody.

1343
04:32:35,059 --> 04:32:36,340
Pay attention, pay attention, everybody watch.

1344
04:32:36,340 --> 04:32:37,540
Look, if you're looking on a different monitor,

1345
04:32:37,540 --> 04:32:50,010
look right now.

1346
04:32:50,010 --> 04:32:52,489
War, it's a free day, free day.

1347
04:32:52,489 --> 04:32:55,409
I remember that.

1348
04:32:55,409 --> 04:33:05,819
Free day.

1349
04:33:05,819 --> 04:33:07,340
Nice work, guys.

1350
04:33:07,340 --> 04:33:08,659
I can always count on you.

1351
04:33:10,540 --> 04:33:13,990
I'm probably at 999 coins.

1352
04:33:13,990 --> 04:33:15,470
Nope, almost.

1353
04:33:26,150 --> 04:33:31,150
Oh, time to grow.

1354
04:33:38,250 --> 04:33:40,009
You know what?

1355
04:33:40,009 --> 04:33:43,540
What do you say we put on a table throw?

1356
04:34:00,009 --> 04:34:01,330
I'm so hungry.

1357
04:34:01,330 --> 04:34:04,180
I wish I had a carbo cookie.

1358
04:34:04,180 --> 04:34:08,130
I wish I had a carbo cookie.

1359
04:34:08,130 --> 04:34:10,220
La dee da.

1360
04:34:10,220 --> 04:34:12,779
It's shower time.

1361
04:34:12,779 --> 04:34:16,250
There there, my pretties.

1362
04:34:16,250 --> 04:34:51,619
Hi ho dee da.

1363
04:34:51,619 --> 04:34:56,209
I'm gonna take it down.

1364
04:34:56,209 --> 04:34:58,529
That broom made my desk vibrate.

1365
04:35:05,459 --> 04:35:07,569
La dee da.

1366
04:35:07,569 --> 04:35:10,069
It's recycled water.

1367
04:35:10,069 --> 04:35:14,060
There there, my pretties.

1368
04:35:14,060 --> 04:35:37,330
Hi ho dee da.

1369
04:35:37,330 --> 04:35:38,930
It's you bliss.

1370
04:35:38,930 --> 04:35:45,659
No, I want an able juice, and I want a geno blast.

1371
04:35:45,659 --> 04:35:49,939
Come on.

1372
04:35:49,939 --> 04:35:51,060
Oh that, you guys are like,

1373
04:35:51,060 --> 04:35:52,459
oh wow, I like that character.

1374
04:35:52,459 --> 04:35:53,580
That sounds like really creepy.

1375
04:35:53,580 --> 04:35:56,220
Yeah, that's what the character's supposed to be.

1376
04:35:56,220 --> 04:36:01,509
The fucking creepy ass motherfucker.

1377
04:36:02,349 --> 04:36:16,580
I'm doing my job right.

1378
04:36:16,580 --> 04:36:18,939
Triple.

1379
04:36:18,939 --> 04:36:19,779
La dee da.

1380
04:36:19,779 --> 04:36:22,900
Oh, I added some nutrients to this one.

1381
04:36:22,900 --> 04:36:23,740
Whoopsie.

1382
04:36:23,740 --> 04:36:25,669
Oh, there there, my pretties.

1383
04:36:25,669 --> 04:36:26,990
Grow up big and strong.

1384
04:36:26,990 --> 04:36:28,549
Hi ho dee da.

1385
04:36:28,549 --> 04:36:29,389
Better?

1386
04:36:29,389 --> 04:36:31,349
You like that better?

1387
04:36:31,349 --> 04:36:49,770
Okay.

1388
04:36:49,770 --> 04:36:55,599
That was bad Mario, come on.

1389
04:36:55,599 --> 04:37:01,259
I haven't been paying attention to anybody's health.

1390
04:37:01,259 --> 04:37:02,099
I probably should be.

1391
04:37:02,099 --> 04:37:05,259
Who has health?

1392
04:37:05,259 --> 04:37:07,389
Oh no.

1393
04:37:07,389 --> 04:37:08,389
First death incoming.

1394
04:37:11,470 --> 04:37:13,029
I have able juice, right?

1395
04:37:13,029 --> 04:37:15,819
Yeah, we're gonna do able juice here.

1396
04:37:15,819 --> 04:37:16,659
I have one more, don't I?

1397
04:37:16,659 --> 04:37:18,779
I do.

1398
04:37:18,779 --> 04:37:20,580
Okay, give this to princess Toadstool

1399
04:37:20,580 --> 04:37:22,020
and Toadstool has to do group hug

1400
04:37:22,020 --> 04:37:28,500
and then group hug and then geno.

1401
04:37:28,500 --> 04:37:30,900
Come on Toadstool, do something.

1402
04:37:30,900 --> 04:37:33,580
Don't do the Mario.

1403
04:37:33,580 --> 04:37:34,700
Do it to Mario.

1404
04:37:34,700 --> 04:37:38,470
That's fine too.

1405
04:37:38,470 --> 04:37:41,310
Okay, can Toadstool get a turn?

1406
04:37:41,310 --> 04:37:42,869
That would be nice.

1407
04:37:42,869 --> 04:37:55,119
Come back.

1408
04:37:55,119 --> 04:37:57,439
For a second I thought it didn't work.

1409
04:37:57,439 --> 04:38:12,810
Like is that possible?

1410
04:38:12,810 --> 04:38:14,720
All right.

1411
04:38:14,720 --> 04:38:18,419
Bring him back again.

1412
04:38:18,419 --> 04:38:26,200
When do I time this?

1413
04:38:26,200 --> 04:38:40,500
Right when at the end or when it comes out?

1414
04:38:40,500 --> 04:38:43,419
Am I gonna play battle for Bikini Bottom remastered?

1415
04:38:43,419 --> 04:38:45,459
Well, after I lose in Mario RPG

1416
04:38:45,459 --> 04:38:47,099
for the first time in 15 years.

1417
04:39:32,979 --> 04:39:33,900
Next game.

1418
04:39:33,900 --> 04:39:37,240
That's no, that's not how this works.

1419
04:39:37,240 --> 04:39:38,799
Oh, I get to do the voice again.

1420
04:39:57,470 --> 04:40:00,880
This is the guy that died to Piranha Plant.

1421
04:40:00,880 --> 04:40:04,029
Yeah, it's a tough fight.

1422
04:40:04,029 --> 04:40:09,419
They change it into all kinds of shrooms.

1423
04:40:09,419 --> 04:40:13,319
I would have Bowser here, but Bowser hurts my eyes.

1424
04:40:13,319 --> 04:40:30,659
So I can't have Bowser here right now.

1425
04:40:30,659 --> 04:40:32,759
When is Piranha Plant gonna get on Smash?

1426
04:40:34,080 --> 04:40:37,639
Um, did you pre-order the game?

1427
04:40:37,639 --> 04:40:38,799
I've got great news for you.

1428
04:40:38,799 --> 04:40:40,319
If you didn't pre-order the game, then I'm sorry,

1429
04:40:40,319 --> 04:41:02,180
but I have some pretty decent news if you did.

1430
04:41:02,180 --> 04:41:03,700
Give me turn.

1431
04:41:03,700 --> 04:41:07,860
Gino has like 40 speed right now.

1432
04:41:07,860 --> 04:41:17,799
I'm just fucking shocked.

1433
04:41:17,799 --> 04:41:20,119
You can buy the plant?

1434
04:41:20,119 --> 04:41:22,740
I'm not, I promise you, I did not know that.

1435
04:41:22,740 --> 04:41:24,400
I thought you had to pre-order that.

1436
04:41:24,400 --> 04:41:25,400
I didn't know you had to buy it.

1437
04:41:25,400 --> 04:41:27,159
I wasn't aware of that.

1438
04:41:27,159 --> 04:41:47,369
I stand corrected.

1439
04:41:47,369 --> 04:41:50,430
Lock.

1440
04:41:50,430 --> 04:41:54,659
No.

1441
04:41:54,659 --> 04:41:55,659
Oh, miss.

1442
04:41:55,819 --> 04:41:58,840
Oh, no.

1443
04:41:58,840 --> 04:42:01,720
I have to get shroom defense.

1444
04:42:01,720 --> 04:42:04,000
I'm gonna die again.

1445
04:42:04,000 --> 04:42:04,959
I have to get like shroom.

1446
04:42:04,959 --> 04:42:08,599
I gotta go back to town and get anti-shroom.

1447
04:42:26,419 --> 04:42:29,619
Somebody might live.

1448
04:42:29,619 --> 04:42:31,099
No, not anymore.

1449
04:42:31,099 --> 04:42:34,959
That's gonna be a triple kill right here.

1450
04:42:34,959 --> 04:42:35,799
Nope, it's not.

1451
04:42:35,799 --> 04:42:36,639
Somebody get out.

1452
04:42:36,639 --> 04:42:37,479
Somebody get out.

1453
04:42:37,479 --> 04:42:39,110
Somebody get out.

1454
04:42:39,110 --> 04:42:39,950
Somebody get out.

1455
04:42:39,950 --> 04:42:40,970
It's been like four turns.

1456
04:42:40,970 --> 04:42:41,810
He's out?

1457
04:42:41,810 --> 04:42:50,419
No.

1458
04:42:50,419 --> 04:42:52,020
Get out.

1459
04:42:52,020 --> 04:42:53,720
Get out.

1460
04:42:53,720 --> 04:42:56,349
He did it again.

1461
04:42:57,189 --> 04:42:58,470
All right, I'm just gonna give Peach the shroom for him.

1462
04:42:58,470 --> 04:43:00,069
Okay, I missed Mario, but that don't matter.

1463
04:43:00,069 --> 04:43:16,970
Mario's, okay, Mario, he's out, he's out, okay, okay, okay.

1464
04:43:16,970 --> 04:43:18,169
Good, I'm glad you did some Mario

1465
04:43:18,169 --> 04:43:28,279
because he's not gonna revive him.

1466
04:43:28,279 --> 04:43:30,040
This is important, I'm going for it.

1467
04:43:30,040 --> 04:43:41,759
I have to, good.

1468
04:43:41,759 --> 04:43:42,799
I have a chance here.

1469
04:43:42,799 --> 04:44:04,310
Now we do a, I'm gonna heal up Mario.

1470
04:44:04,310 --> 04:44:19,459
I got it unlocked now.

1471
04:44:19,459 --> 04:44:24,500
As long as he doesn't do the mushroom thing again.

1472
04:44:24,500 --> 04:44:39,979
Because then Peach can come out and do a group heal.

1473
04:44:39,979 --> 04:44:47,750
Hey, look at that, group hug, let's go.

1474
04:44:47,750 --> 04:44:49,549
All is good.

1475
04:44:56,959 --> 04:45:40,169
Oh, for fuck's sake.

1476
04:45:40,169 --> 04:45:51,889
Fuck off.

1477
04:45:51,889 --> 04:45:54,450
Everybody three times in a row.

1478
04:45:54,450 --> 04:46:00,180
Oh, come on, that is actual stupid bullshit.

1479
04:46:00,180 --> 04:46:03,750
Peach is gonna die.

1480
04:46:03,750 --> 04:46:06,029
Usually he's going for Peach every time.

1481
04:46:06,029 --> 04:46:13,900
Okay, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right.

1482
04:46:13,900 --> 04:46:18,970
I have to keep Peach alive.

1483
04:46:18,970 --> 04:46:20,689
She's all right, she's pretty much near full health.

1484
04:46:20,689 --> 04:46:25,689
Okay, now I'm gonna do, we're gonna do this again.

1485
04:46:27,580 --> 04:46:31,580
Mario's out, game over.

1486
04:46:32,419 --> 04:46:57,110
He can't have that much health, let's do it again.

1487
04:46:57,110 --> 04:46:59,009
We're going in a circle.

1488
04:46:59,009 --> 04:47:19,330
Okay, I've had enough, goodbye.

1489
04:47:19,330 --> 04:47:20,689
Oh, look what you did.

1490
04:47:20,689 --> 04:47:23,459
Smilax has been whacked.

1491
04:47:23,459 --> 04:47:25,180
Oh, I'm gonna get it.

1492
04:47:25,180 --> 04:47:28,779
Queen Valentina told me to keep everyone out of Nimbus land.

1493
04:47:28,779 --> 04:47:29,619
What should I do?

1494
04:47:32,619 --> 04:47:34,220
I know how to run away.

1495
04:47:37,159 --> 04:47:38,500
I dropped something.

1496
04:47:40,520 --> 04:47:41,779
What's this?

1497
04:47:41,779 --> 04:47:43,580
It's a seed.

1498
04:47:44,939 --> 04:47:46,580
Picked up a seed.

1499
04:47:46,580 --> 04:48:03,580
There's the seed, I found it, and boing.

1500
04:48:03,580 --> 04:48:05,380
And yes, you don't need to tell me.

1501
04:48:05,380 --> 04:48:11,009
I know where the, I know where the other insane thing is.

1502
04:48:12,060 --> 04:48:15,650
I know where it is.

1503
04:48:15,650 --> 04:48:19,139
Wow, did you see that?

1504
04:48:19,139 --> 04:48:21,979
It's a magical beanstalk.

1505
04:48:21,979 --> 04:48:26,180
Big, huge, all the way up into the sky.

1506
04:48:26,180 --> 04:48:29,659
It's the biggest beanstalk I've ever seen.

1507
04:48:29,659 --> 04:48:31,459
Hit the block once more and you'll get on it.

1508
04:48:31,459 --> 04:48:36,470
I promise.

1509
04:48:36,470 --> 04:48:38,430
Sorry, the mouse had the blue dialogue,

1510
04:48:38,430 --> 04:48:53,540
so I'm just kind of keeping with the cannon here.

1511
04:48:53,540 --> 04:48:56,590
I need, okay, I'm all right with health.

1512
04:48:59,380 --> 04:49:00,580
How to climb the vines.

1513
04:49:00,580 --> 04:49:01,900
The vines are positioned from the bottom

1514
04:49:01,900 --> 04:49:03,340
to the left to the top of the right.

1515
04:49:03,340 --> 04:49:05,939
When you jump, you will be able to disengage yourself

1516
04:49:05,939 --> 04:49:11,599
in the vine, Nimbus Department of Transportation.

1517
04:49:11,599 --> 04:49:16,520
And it goes like that, it goes, doot, doot, doot, doot.

1518
04:49:16,520 --> 04:49:21,360
I wanna see what that one is.

1519
04:49:21,360 --> 04:49:30,479
I'm curious about that one.

1520
04:49:30,479 --> 04:49:36,020
Really?

1521
04:49:36,020 --> 04:49:37,700
All right, guys, fine.

1522
04:49:37,700 --> 04:49:40,819
I love this area because it has the cool background.

1523
04:49:54,860 --> 04:49:57,819
Oh yeah, the fat Koopa.

1524
04:49:57,819 --> 04:50:03,810
If you let them launch, I think they kill everybody.

1525
04:50:03,810 --> 04:50:12,389
Oh shit.

1526
04:50:12,389 --> 04:50:16,340
All right, let's keep moving.

1527
04:50:16,340 --> 04:50:23,779
Flower tab.

1528
04:50:23,779 --> 04:50:36,119
Coins, I'm gonna get all these.

1529
04:50:36,119 --> 04:50:43,819
I was gonna say, does this thing not exist?

1530
04:50:43,819 --> 04:50:45,259
Ooh, caught it right at the end

1531
04:50:45,259 --> 04:50:47,020
and this one's on the other side.

1532
04:50:47,020 --> 04:50:58,529
Oh, you idiot.

1533
04:50:58,529 --> 04:51:00,819
How do I get this one?

1534
04:51:00,819 --> 04:51:05,819
Because you have to come on it from a different angle.

1535
04:51:05,860 --> 04:51:20,689
Can't come in from the front, can I?

1536
04:51:20,689 --> 04:51:22,169
Those clouds.

1537
04:51:22,169 --> 04:51:41,860
This is just you guys in chat right now.

1538
04:51:41,860 --> 04:51:46,270
I'm trying to come around the edge, but I can't grab.

1539
04:51:46,270 --> 04:51:47,110
Look at the shadow.

1540
04:51:47,110 --> 04:51:48,110
No, I know it's on this.

1541
04:51:48,110 --> 04:51:50,229
It's on the front, right?

1542
04:51:50,229 --> 04:51:58,119
Can I just, no.

1543
04:51:58,119 --> 04:52:00,319
Because if I can't jump and get it,

1544
04:52:00,319 --> 04:52:02,880
I'm on the other side and it's in front of me

1545
04:52:02,880 --> 04:52:08,709
and I can't get to the front.

1546
04:52:08,709 --> 04:52:16,700
Oh, oh my God.

1547
04:52:16,700 --> 04:52:26,580
This is gonna drive me fucking crazy.

1548
04:52:26,580 --> 04:52:27,419
Holy shit.

1549
04:52:27,419 --> 04:52:28,580
Okay, let's go right here.

1550
04:52:28,580 --> 04:53:22,520
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

1551
04:53:22,520 --> 04:53:23,360
It's finicky.

1552
04:53:33,419 --> 04:53:34,259
I have to get them.

1553
04:53:34,259 --> 04:53:43,270
They're so easy, but they're not.

1554
04:53:43,270 --> 04:53:44,430
What plane are they on?

1555
04:53:47,099 --> 04:53:48,340
This forward plane right here.

1556
04:53:48,340 --> 04:53:50,540
Okay, got it.

1557
04:53:50,540 --> 04:53:53,979
Good.

1558
04:53:53,979 --> 04:53:57,250
Here we are.

1559
04:53:57,250 --> 04:54:08,860
This is a very good song, by the way.

1560
04:54:08,860 --> 04:54:10,619
All right, everybody, listen up.

1561
04:54:27,380 --> 04:54:28,220
Shut.

1562
04:54:34,290 --> 04:54:35,369
Shut up.

1563
04:54:35,369 --> 04:54:36,209
Shut up.

1564
04:54:36,209 --> 04:54:37,650
Shut up.

1565
04:54:37,650 --> 04:54:40,400
Shut up.

1566
04:54:40,400 --> 04:54:43,779
Shut up.

1567
04:54:43,779 --> 04:54:46,700
King Nimbus's condition is growing worse.

1568
04:54:47,419 --> 04:54:52,770
This means we'll be losing our magnificent ruler.

1569
04:54:52,770 --> 04:54:57,509
But it just so happens that I have found the missing prince.

1570
04:54:57,509 --> 04:55:02,439
Prince Melo, that is.

1571
04:55:02,439 --> 04:55:03,880
Prince Melo?

1572
04:55:03,880 --> 04:55:06,200
Please, sir, prince.

1573
04:55:10,299 --> 04:55:16,909
Get over here.

1574
04:55:16,909 --> 04:55:18,459
Well, well.

1575
04:55:18,459 --> 04:55:20,900
It seems that our little prince

1576
04:55:20,900 --> 04:55:23,419
has a mild case of stage fright.

1577
04:55:23,419 --> 04:55:24,380
Excuse me.

1578
04:55:28,310 --> 04:55:29,349
Where it's gonna happen.

1579
04:55:29,349 --> 04:55:31,459
I don't, wait.

1580
04:55:31,459 --> 04:55:36,889
Make it snappy.

1581
04:55:37,689 --> 04:55:39,659
You can't get through.

1582
04:55:39,659 --> 04:55:47,819
Just look at you, tubby.

1583
04:55:47,819 --> 04:55:52,610
Introducing Prince Melo.

1584
04:55:52,610 --> 04:55:55,830
Look at that, Prince Melo.

1585
04:55:55,830 --> 04:55:58,349
My, you've filled out a bit, Prince Melo.

1586
04:56:00,810 --> 04:56:06,020
You're looking fit, prince.

1587
04:56:06,020 --> 04:56:09,939
Yes, what is it, dear?

1588
04:56:09,939 --> 04:56:10,939
What?

1589
04:56:10,939 --> 04:56:13,330
You're asking me to?

1590
04:56:13,330 --> 04:56:15,020
Gracious.

1591
04:56:15,020 --> 04:56:16,819
You're serious, aren't you?

1592
04:56:16,819 --> 04:56:19,180
Why, I don't know what to say.

1593
04:56:19,180 --> 04:56:23,340
Dear me, I've made my decision.

1594
04:56:23,340 --> 04:56:25,860
At the request of prince, of the prince,

1595
04:56:25,860 --> 04:56:29,659
I agree to become his queen.

1596
04:56:29,659 --> 04:56:31,340
Here it comes.

1597
04:56:31,340 --> 04:56:36,880
Queen Valentina, oh, it just makes me shiver.

1598
04:56:36,880 --> 04:56:39,799
Fucking do it.

1599
04:56:39,799 --> 04:56:40,639
Well, that's that.

1600
04:56:40,639 --> 04:56:44,099
Back to your business, everyone.

1601
04:56:44,099 --> 04:56:52,939
Hurry it up, William.

1602
04:56:52,939 --> 04:56:54,900
It's been a while since we've heard him.

1603
04:56:56,459 --> 04:56:57,860
Can you believe it?

1604
04:56:57,860 --> 04:56:59,099
What a coincidence.

1605
04:56:59,099 --> 04:57:02,540
There's a prince with the same name as me.

1606
04:57:02,540 --> 04:57:05,540
Don't we have anything better to do than hang around here?

1607
04:57:05,540 --> 04:57:18,540
Come on, let's go and find the rest of the star pieces.

1608
04:57:18,540 --> 04:57:21,419
Say, you have that, I'm looking for something,

1609
04:57:21,419 --> 04:57:22,860
look in your eyes.

1610
04:57:22,860 --> 04:57:28,959
What can I do for you?

1611
04:57:28,959 --> 04:57:36,299
Mega glove, war fan, and cannon, sticky glove,

1612
04:57:38,419 --> 04:57:40,939
fuzzy shirt, fuzzy cape, fuzzy dress.

1613
04:57:46,220 --> 04:57:47,180
All right, this is gonna take it.

1614
04:57:47,180 --> 04:57:48,299
I have a lot of stuff in here.

1615
04:57:48,299 --> 04:57:50,189
Okay, wait.

1616
04:57:50,189 --> 04:57:53,790
Pearly gloves are for mega gloves.

1617
04:57:56,259 --> 04:57:59,200
These are kind of jokey.

1618
04:57:59,200 --> 04:58:02,529
War fan for princess Peach.

1619
04:58:02,569 --> 04:58:06,619
Hand cannon for Gino.

1620
04:58:06,619 --> 04:58:12,330
Sticky glove for Mello.

1621
04:58:12,330 --> 04:58:14,409
Now we have courage, should we just keep that on?

1622
04:58:14,409 --> 04:58:21,060
No, just sell it.

1623
04:58:21,060 --> 04:58:30,000
Fuzzy shirt, fuzzy shirt, fuzzy cape is better than...

1624
04:58:32,970 --> 04:58:36,130
80 versus what?

1625
04:58:36,130 --> 04:58:39,130
71, that's pretty bad.

1626
04:58:39,130 --> 04:58:42,490
I think work pants have kind of outgrown them.

1627
04:58:50,819 --> 04:58:59,389
I think it's not worth keeping them on because of the defense.

1628
04:58:59,430 --> 04:59:01,830
I also should give the ghost medal to somebody here.

1629
04:59:05,470 --> 04:59:06,389
What does the ghost medal do?

1630
04:59:06,389 --> 04:59:11,119
Raises defense while attacking, what does that even mean?

1631
04:59:11,119 --> 04:59:14,119
Okay, so we have, we'll keep all the accessories.

1632
04:59:14,119 --> 04:59:17,340
Fuzzy dress, put that on.

1633
04:59:17,340 --> 04:59:19,180
Sailor cape, these can all, I can sell all of this.

1634
04:59:19,180 --> 04:59:21,459
Ribbit stick, double punch is not good.

1635
04:59:21,459 --> 04:59:25,450
Hurly gloves, not as good, right?

1636
04:59:25,450 --> 04:59:26,970
No.

1637
04:59:26,970 --> 04:59:31,250
Yeah, trust this can be sold.

1638
04:59:31,250 --> 04:59:34,729
Trooper shell, parasol, hurly gloves,

1639
04:59:34,729 --> 04:59:37,090
double stick, ribbit stick.

1640
04:59:37,090 --> 04:59:40,169
Sailor shirt, sailor cape, not a good dress.

1641
04:59:40,169 --> 04:59:44,939
I'm gonna hold on to the work pants just in case.

1642
04:59:44,939 --> 04:59:46,900
Rest of the stuff, jump shoes,

1643
04:59:46,900 --> 04:59:49,950
I'm just kind of keeping them for no reason.

1644
04:59:49,950 --> 04:59:51,979
Okay, let's buy.

1645
04:59:57,490 --> 04:59:59,490
How many, I have no more mid mushrooms.

1646
05:00:01,819 --> 05:00:03,700
Five pick me ups.

1647
05:00:03,700 --> 05:00:05,659
I probably should get a couple of these.

1648
05:00:08,560 --> 05:00:09,599
You know what, I feel like I haven't had

1649
05:00:09,599 --> 05:00:11,639
a flower box in a while.

1650
05:00:11,639 --> 05:00:13,599
Here we go, a flower jar, finally, okay.

1651
05:00:14,599 --> 05:00:21,459
Hmm, get rid of this mushroom.

1652
05:00:21,459 --> 05:00:30,840
Use the flower box right now.

1653
05:00:30,840 --> 05:00:33,080
Still want these pure waters, I can sell the pure water,

1654
05:00:33,080 --> 05:00:33,919
what do I care?

1655
05:00:45,400 --> 05:00:46,319
It's worth a lot.

1656
05:00:48,040 --> 05:00:50,400
Rock candy is really good.

1657
05:00:50,400 --> 05:00:54,700
Still have the seed, I'm not getting rid of that.

1658
05:00:54,700 --> 05:01:02,110
This looks all right, maybe a couple more maple syrups.

1659
05:01:02,110 --> 05:01:13,810
Five of them, all right, I'm ready.

1660
05:01:13,810 --> 05:01:15,529
I used to work for King Nimbus,

1661
05:01:15,529 --> 05:01:16,889
but all of a sudden one day,

1662
05:01:16,889 --> 05:01:19,209
Valentina told me I was fired.

1663
05:01:19,209 --> 05:01:20,369
I just don't get it.

1664
05:01:20,369 --> 05:01:28,669
He needs help, he's sick.

1665
05:01:28,669 --> 05:01:30,750
We used to be able to walk through the castle freely,

1666
05:01:30,750 --> 05:01:34,419
but I guess we shouldn't disturb the king now.

1667
05:01:34,419 --> 05:01:36,810
Have you seen the volcano?

1668
05:01:36,810 --> 05:01:38,020
Not yet.

1669
05:01:38,020 --> 05:01:39,900
Ooh, the volcano's to the east.

1670
05:01:39,900 --> 05:01:47,639
Sure wish I could take a dip in the springs.

1671
05:01:47,639 --> 05:01:49,720
I'm watching that volcano over there, what?

1672
05:01:49,720 --> 05:01:55,939
Star pieces, huh, never heard of them.

1673
05:01:55,939 --> 05:01:58,060
Why did Prince Malo make Valentina his queen?

1674
05:01:58,060 --> 05:02:03,569
I guess it's because she found him.

1675
05:02:03,569 --> 05:02:05,209
You know about the royal bus?

1676
05:02:05,209 --> 05:02:06,810
What's the royal bus?

1677
05:02:06,810 --> 05:02:09,009
It's a regal vehicle used only by the king.

1678
05:02:09,009 --> 05:02:11,290
It's parked now due to the fact that he's ill.

1679
05:02:17,700 --> 05:02:27,759
I'm going, before we do this, I'll be right back.

1680
05:02:27,759 --> 05:02:28,799
Hot springs are up ahead,

1681
05:02:28,799 --> 05:02:30,240
but only royalty can bathe in there,

1682
05:02:30,240 --> 05:02:37,450
and you don't look so royal.

1683
05:02:37,450 --> 05:02:40,369
I wanna go give the seed to the elder guy.

1684
05:02:58,020 --> 05:03:04,099
I think it's over here, right?

1685
05:03:04,099 --> 05:03:05,060
Where is the elder?

1686
05:03:05,060 --> 05:03:05,900
Up here.

1687
05:03:12,369 --> 05:03:15,000
See this pot over here?

1688
05:03:15,000 --> 05:03:16,720
This is the elder of the town.

1689
05:03:16,720 --> 05:03:18,319
Oh, it's the gardener.

1690
05:03:18,319 --> 05:03:19,599
Hi, I'm the gardener.

1691
05:03:19,639 --> 05:03:21,439
See that huge planter?

1692
05:03:21,439 --> 05:03:23,840
I spent many years seeking the legendary seed

1693
05:03:23,840 --> 05:03:25,840
and fertilizer to fill it with,

1694
05:03:25,840 --> 05:03:26,919
but I've had no luck.

1695
05:03:27,880 --> 05:03:30,139
If only I could find them.

1696
05:03:30,139 --> 05:03:31,259
Oh, incredible, I can't believe it.

1697
05:03:31,259 --> 05:03:32,099
It's a legendary seed.

1698
05:03:32,099 --> 05:03:33,500
I've been reading about it in the average garden text.

1699
05:03:33,500 --> 05:03:34,340
These are so rare.

1700
05:03:34,340 --> 05:03:35,819
Can you even begin to comprehend what a huge discovery this is?

1701
05:03:35,819 --> 05:03:39,270
I spent my whole life.

1702
05:03:39,270 --> 05:03:42,549
Hey, I haven't finished yet.

1703
05:03:42,549 --> 05:03:44,110
Well, that's my story.

1704
05:03:44,110 --> 05:03:50,240
Will you give me that seed?

1705
05:03:50,240 --> 05:03:51,880
I finally have it.

1706
05:03:51,880 --> 05:04:00,740
This is extraordinary.

1707
05:04:00,740 --> 05:04:09,080
He has the seed, I need to bring the fertilizer.

1708
05:04:09,240 --> 05:04:10,439
I need to get the fertilizer.

1709
05:04:10,439 --> 05:04:12,080
Something special might happen.

1710
05:04:12,080 --> 05:04:17,080
Now, I'm going to go fight Jinx again.

1711
05:04:17,919 --> 05:04:19,880
Those of you who remember who Jinx is,

1712
05:04:21,040 --> 05:04:23,479
he's the guy back here in monster town.

1713
05:04:25,520 --> 05:04:44,389
We're doing a cleanup loose ends here.

1714
05:04:44,389 --> 05:04:49,650
I wonder if I can beat him.

1715
05:04:49,650 --> 05:04:52,049
I also have the temple key, which I haven't used.

1716
05:04:53,689 --> 05:05:01,909
All right, let me save it first.

1717
05:05:01,909 --> 05:05:02,750
Where is there a save point in here?

1718
05:05:02,750 --> 05:05:08,979
Isn't there someone in here somewhere?

1719
05:05:08,979 --> 05:05:34,020
I also didn't do the 30 jumps either.

1720
05:05:34,020 --> 05:05:43,580
Who the hell is the save point here?

1721
05:05:43,580 --> 05:05:44,419
I'll be fine.

1722
05:05:50,159 --> 05:05:52,319
Hole, hole, hole, hole, hole.

1723
05:05:52,319 --> 05:05:53,840
I don't remember.

1724
05:05:53,840 --> 05:05:56,400
You don't actually die though, if you lose to Jinx.

1725
05:06:02,659 --> 05:06:03,500
You want a challenge?

1726
05:06:03,500 --> 05:06:08,110
Let's go.

1727
05:06:08,110 --> 05:06:10,509
Here we go.

1728
05:06:10,509 --> 05:06:11,909
Let's see if I can beat him.

1729
05:06:17,299 --> 05:06:18,779
Ooh, I don't think so.

1730
05:06:22,000 --> 05:06:23,680
Quick, run away.

1731
05:06:23,680 --> 05:06:25,130
Run.

1732
05:06:25,130 --> 05:06:32,680
Just get up, just get up.

1733
05:06:32,720 --> 05:06:34,880
How disappointing, running during the middle of a match.

1734
05:06:34,880 --> 05:06:36,479
Come back when you've leveled up sufficiently

1735
05:06:36,479 --> 05:06:37,560
and we'll try again.

1736
05:06:42,250 --> 05:06:44,119
Instant death.

1737
05:06:44,119 --> 05:06:46,240
Mario instant death.

1738
05:06:50,709 --> 05:06:56,790
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1739
05:06:56,790 --> 05:06:58,750
That's what happens when chat chooses levels up.

1740
05:06:58,750 --> 05:07:01,229
I want to go back to the temple.

1741
05:07:01,229 --> 05:07:03,229
I have a temple key.

1742
05:07:03,229 --> 05:07:05,470
I'm fairly certain I can do something in here.

1743
05:07:12,930 --> 05:07:17,060
I go up here, I have to get my fortune again.

1744
05:07:26,939 --> 05:07:29,939
Where is it?

1745
05:07:29,939 --> 05:07:31,939
I'm not accepting visitors, it's past my bedtime.

1746
05:07:31,979 --> 05:07:32,819
Okay, there we go.

1747
05:07:39,619 --> 05:07:41,569
There he is.

1748
05:07:41,569 --> 05:07:45,069
That key you have there looks pretty tasty.

1749
05:07:45,069 --> 05:07:49,840
You can have the key.

1750
05:07:49,840 --> 05:07:55,060
It's poison.

1751
05:07:55,060 --> 05:08:00,680
Absolute jackpot.

1752
05:08:00,680 --> 05:08:03,290
Royal syrup.

1753
05:08:03,290 --> 05:08:06,919
Max mushroom.

1754
05:08:06,919 --> 05:08:09,849
Fire bomb.

1755
05:08:09,849 --> 05:08:11,889
No, it's the worst, probably picked me up.

1756
05:08:11,889 --> 05:08:17,740
Or mushroom maybe, yeah.

1757
05:08:20,770 --> 05:08:28,220
And then one, two, three, four flower tabs.

1758
05:08:28,220 --> 05:08:32,380
Now, I think it's time that I try to do the casino.

1759
05:08:32,380 --> 05:08:36,180
We have to go back to Booster's Tower.

1760
05:08:36,180 --> 05:08:37,959
Wait, what am I doing?

1761
05:08:37,959 --> 05:08:38,799
I just leave, can't I?

1762
05:08:38,799 --> 05:08:47,619
No.

1763
05:08:47,619 --> 05:08:55,939
I just want to go in there.

1764
05:08:55,939 --> 05:08:57,580
Just keep and smell the cards.

1765
05:09:06,360 --> 05:09:09,880
I have to go win a other casino game.

1766
05:09:11,240 --> 05:09:13,720
A shitload of times, I think, if I remember this

1767
05:09:13,720 --> 05:09:14,799
from what I Googled.

1768
05:09:29,220 --> 05:09:42,049
Back to Booster's Tower.

1769
05:09:42,049 --> 05:09:49,880
All right, we have to make it back up to the top

1770
05:09:49,880 --> 05:09:54,729
to go to the secret casino.

1771
05:09:54,770 --> 05:10:18,049
And then it includes that chain chomp.

1772
05:10:18,049 --> 05:10:20,209
Come on, I'm telling you, I'm way higher than these guys.

1773
05:10:20,209 --> 05:10:23,259
I can run.

1774
05:10:23,259 --> 05:10:25,450
Jeremy.

1775
05:10:25,450 --> 05:10:26,290
Look, just get her.

1776
05:10:26,290 --> 05:10:32,130
Just.

1777
05:10:32,130 --> 05:10:33,250
Am I gonna fight the secret boss?

1778
05:10:33,250 --> 05:10:34,330
Yes.

1779
05:10:34,330 --> 05:10:38,250
I will defeat, probably first try,

1780
05:10:38,250 --> 05:10:45,659
the hardest secret, almost impossible boss in the game.

1781
05:10:45,659 --> 05:10:55,729
In fact, I probably guarantee it.

1782
05:10:55,729 --> 05:10:57,529
Because I'm going to have certain items

1783
05:10:57,529 --> 05:11:01,119
that will make me very, very strong.

1784
05:11:01,119 --> 05:11:03,849
There he is.

1785
05:11:04,689 --> 05:11:07,330
I'm really, really sorry about before.

1786
05:11:07,330 --> 05:11:09,290
Here, I'll make it up to ya.

1787
05:11:09,290 --> 05:11:11,119
Yeehaw.

1788
05:11:11,119 --> 05:11:12,680
Are you having fun yet?

1789
05:11:12,680 --> 05:11:14,259
Hee hee.

1790
05:11:14,259 --> 05:11:15,500
Ah, that was just practice.

1791
05:11:15,500 --> 05:11:16,580
This time for real.

1792
05:11:16,580 --> 05:11:20,349
Yep, do it.

1793
05:11:20,349 --> 05:11:22,470
Guess which hand the yellow ball is in.

1794
05:11:22,470 --> 05:11:29,119
If you can, watch carefully.

1795
05:11:29,119 --> 05:11:30,159
Which hand is it in?

1796
05:11:31,689 --> 05:11:39,200
Very good, it's a prize.

1797
05:11:39,200 --> 05:11:40,040
You want to play?

1798
05:11:40,040 --> 05:11:41,869
I do.

1799
05:11:41,869 --> 05:11:47,740
Which hand is the yellow ball in?

1800
05:11:47,740 --> 05:11:49,939
Again.

1801
05:11:49,939 --> 05:11:51,099
The wilt shroom.

1802
05:11:51,099 --> 05:11:55,869
Ooh, doesn't that, this is for the weirdo, right?

1803
05:11:55,869 --> 05:11:59,970
The weirdo wants one of these.

1804
05:11:59,970 --> 05:12:06,630
What's cheaper, pick me up or mid-mushroom?

1805
05:12:06,630 --> 05:12:09,659
Want to play?

1806
05:12:09,659 --> 05:12:12,979
There we go.

1807
05:12:12,979 --> 05:12:16,180
Left again.

1808
05:12:16,180 --> 05:12:18,860
Wilt shroom, more wilt shrooms.

1809
05:12:18,860 --> 05:12:24,130
I don't think I want more than one of these.

1810
05:12:24,130 --> 05:12:32,209
It's wilted.

1811
05:12:32,209 --> 05:12:38,819
Let's go.

1812
05:12:38,819 --> 05:12:44,419
Right, another wilt shroom.

1813
05:12:49,099 --> 05:12:53,880
I have to do it again.

1814
05:12:53,880 --> 05:12:57,369
Left hand.

1815
05:12:57,369 --> 05:13:02,479
Another wilted shroom.

1816
05:13:02,479 --> 05:13:03,639
Want to play again?

1817
05:13:03,639 --> 05:13:09,220
I do.

1818
05:13:09,220 --> 05:13:27,270
Right, rotten mush.

1819
05:13:27,270 --> 05:13:32,380
Right, mid-mushroom.

1820
05:13:32,380 --> 05:13:43,209
Hey, cool, throw it away.

1821
05:13:43,209 --> 05:13:47,459
Left hand.

1822
05:13:47,459 --> 05:13:48,459
More rotten mush.

1823
05:13:48,459 --> 05:13:51,459
I don't want it, because I already have one.

1824
05:13:51,459 --> 05:13:53,099
What's the text on this?

1825
05:13:53,099 --> 05:13:54,060
Ew, it's rotten.

1826
05:13:58,889 --> 05:14:01,889
Again, what the fuck is happening?

1827
05:14:01,889 --> 05:14:22,939
I have to do this.

1828
05:14:22,939 --> 05:14:24,540
Come on, how many more do I need to do?

1829
05:14:24,540 --> 05:14:33,810
Like two, three?

1830
05:14:33,810 --> 05:14:43,909
Left, moldy mush.

1831
05:14:43,909 --> 05:14:53,000
All right, right hand.

1832
05:14:53,000 --> 05:14:55,000
Congratulations, you deserve this.

1833
05:14:55,000 --> 05:14:59,310
You got a bright card.

1834
05:14:59,310 --> 05:15:02,830
All right, throw away, pick me up.

1835
05:15:02,830 --> 05:15:05,590
I'll let you get into my brother's casino.

1836
05:15:05,590 --> 05:15:19,720
Wherever that is.

1837
05:15:19,720 --> 05:15:27,639
Member's card for the casino.

1838
05:15:27,639 --> 05:15:34,419
Come on, let's go save it.

1839
05:15:34,419 --> 05:15:39,180
Now we go back to Bean Valley.

1840
05:15:39,180 --> 05:15:43,040
Can I do anything else up here?

1841
05:15:43,040 --> 05:15:44,639
Trying to remember if there's anything else to do

1842
05:15:44,639 --> 05:15:45,680
in the booster tower.

1843
05:16:09,380 --> 05:16:11,099
Oh, come on, this is still active?

1844
05:16:11,099 --> 05:16:26,159
Get out of here.

1845
05:16:26,159 --> 05:16:27,119
It's nonsense.

1846
05:16:28,810 --> 05:16:29,650
Oops.

1847
05:16:29,650 --> 05:16:31,250
Oh yeah, they have new weapons.

1848
05:16:31,250 --> 05:16:41,459
Let's get the big hamburger gloves.

1849
05:16:41,819 --> 05:16:45,900
Oh my God, I just don't want.

1850
05:16:45,900 --> 05:16:53,860
Just do it, I don't care.

1851
05:16:53,860 --> 05:17:12,099
I don't even want to do any more attacks.

1852
05:17:12,099 --> 05:17:15,849
Mari.

1853
05:17:15,849 --> 05:17:16,689
Do you want to play a casino?

1854
05:17:16,689 --> 05:17:18,250
Just play the new NBA game.

1855
05:17:18,250 --> 05:17:24,540
It has an actual slot machine for real money.

1856
05:17:24,540 --> 05:17:26,060
You know what, just do it.

1857
05:17:29,389 --> 05:17:43,720
Wait, why does an NBA game have slot machines in it?

1858
05:17:43,720 --> 05:17:55,860
I didn't even touch it.

1859
05:17:55,860 --> 05:18:14,189
That doesn't make any sense.

1860
05:18:14,189 --> 05:18:26,930
I want to win my next bribe and fall from the sky.

1861
05:18:26,930 --> 05:18:36,750
Well, that wasn't worth coming all the way up here.

1862
05:18:36,750 --> 05:18:38,990
How dry his mouth must be.

1863
05:18:40,029 --> 05:19:04,069
Pretty dry.

1864
05:19:04,069 --> 05:19:07,029
So let's get to the casino.

1865
05:19:07,029 --> 05:19:07,990
Now I have to go back to Bean Valley.

1866
05:19:07,990 --> 05:19:09,389
Oh my God.

1867
05:19:09,389 --> 05:19:12,909
I just, I can't even run away.

1868
05:19:26,419 --> 05:19:28,970
Oof, I like that.

1869
05:19:28,970 --> 05:19:30,409
That's got a good sound to it.

1870
05:19:45,590 --> 05:19:47,459
Okay.

1871
05:19:47,459 --> 05:19:50,740
Let's go back to Bean Valley.

1872
05:19:50,740 --> 05:20:00,639
Go in there and do the thing we need to do

1873
05:20:00,639 --> 05:20:13,700
go in the secret casino.

1874
05:20:13,700 --> 05:20:23,619
I'm excited.

1875
05:20:23,619 --> 05:20:30,779
Bean Valley.

1876
05:20:30,779 --> 05:20:37,139
Pretty good dodges right there.

1877
05:20:37,139 --> 05:20:40,259
It doesn't sound very excited.

1878
05:20:40,259 --> 05:20:48,310
Well, I can assure you, I am very excited.

1879
05:20:48,310 --> 05:20:50,029
Did Jerma play Mario 64?

1880
05:20:50,029 --> 05:20:52,430
That's all I did when I was younger.

1881
05:20:52,430 --> 05:20:58,950
It's the only game I played.

1882
05:20:58,950 --> 05:21:02,659
What about this one up here?

1883
05:21:02,659 --> 05:21:03,619
Let's go, dude.

1884
05:21:03,619 --> 05:21:05,099
Let's go.

1885
05:21:05,099 --> 05:21:14,419
Let's go.

1886
05:21:14,419 --> 05:21:16,180
Would I ever try to speed run this game?

1887
05:21:16,180 --> 05:21:24,430
No, I never tried to speed run any game,

1888
05:21:24,430 --> 05:21:35,619
let alone this one.

1889
05:21:35,659 --> 05:21:36,580
I told you this joke before,

1890
05:21:36,580 --> 05:21:41,970
I was actually gonna try to memorize the first 12,

1891
05:21:41,970 --> 05:21:44,450
probably five to 10 minutes, maybe 10 minutes total

1892
05:21:44,450 --> 05:21:52,639
of the Dark Souls one speed run.

1893
05:21:52,639 --> 05:21:54,959
I was gonna try and learn the first

1894
05:21:54,959 --> 05:21:59,580
at least few minutes of the Dark Souls one speed run

1895
05:21:59,580 --> 05:22:00,419
and just do it on stream

1896
05:22:00,419 --> 05:22:09,779
and just pretend like I was gonna actually do it.

1897
05:22:09,779 --> 05:22:16,590
Here we go.

1898
05:22:16,590 --> 05:22:28,090
Great guys casino.

1899
05:22:28,090 --> 05:22:34,569
It's inside of somebody's house.

1900
05:22:34,569 --> 05:22:38,000
It's a really, really high and plain site here, huh?

1901
05:22:38,000 --> 05:22:45,139
Great guy.

1902
05:22:45,139 --> 05:22:56,540
Please enjoy yourself.

1903
05:22:56,540 --> 05:22:58,159
Hello, Mario.

1904
05:22:58,159 --> 05:22:59,900
I run this casino.

1905
05:22:59,900 --> 05:23:03,139
Feel free to enjoy yourself.

1906
05:23:03,139 --> 05:23:05,099
Business is slow.

1907
05:23:05,099 --> 05:23:08,869
Hey Mario, wanna play look the other way with me?

1908
05:23:08,869 --> 05:23:10,389
Ready and look the other,

1909
05:23:10,389 --> 05:23:13,990
hit left or right on the control pad.

1910
05:23:13,990 --> 05:23:19,209
Wait, gotcha, I win.

1911
05:23:19,209 --> 05:23:28,080
What a shitty casino.

1912
05:23:28,080 --> 05:23:29,779
Let's do it again.

1913
05:23:29,779 --> 05:23:31,349
Look the other way.

1914
05:23:31,349 --> 05:23:34,290
Got it.

1915
05:23:34,290 --> 05:23:35,290
Oh, you didn't get caught.

1916
05:23:35,290 --> 05:23:37,130
I lost this round.

1917
05:23:37,130 --> 05:23:38,900
You can have this.

1918
05:23:38,900 --> 05:23:49,810
Multi mush and guess what we have to do.

1919
05:23:49,810 --> 05:23:57,060
Look the other way.

1920
05:23:57,060 --> 05:23:58,909
You can have this.

1921
05:23:58,909 --> 05:23:59,909
A mushroom.

1922
05:23:59,909 --> 05:24:06,619
Ooh.

1923
05:24:06,619 --> 05:24:08,930
I'm not gonna say he's gonna go right.

1924
05:24:08,930 --> 05:24:10,389
That's what he wants me to think.

1925
05:24:10,389 --> 05:24:15,990
Yep.

1926
05:24:15,990 --> 05:24:23,580
Rotten mush.

1927
05:24:23,580 --> 05:24:24,819
He's gone left a few times.

1928
05:24:24,819 --> 05:24:27,619
He's gonna go left.

1929
05:24:27,619 --> 05:24:34,580
Damn it.

1930
05:24:34,580 --> 05:24:39,060
God damn it.

1931
05:24:39,060 --> 05:24:40,900
Same way.

1932
05:24:40,900 --> 05:24:42,299
What?

1933
05:24:42,299 --> 05:24:47,639
You did three times to the right?

1934
05:24:47,639 --> 05:24:48,720
Oh my God.

1935
05:24:48,720 --> 05:24:53,669
He's playing me like a film.

1936
05:25:01,770 --> 05:25:08,709
What the fuck?

1937
05:25:08,709 --> 05:25:16,200
Oh my God.

1938
05:25:16,200 --> 05:25:42,500
This is almost statistically not possible.

1939
05:25:42,500 --> 05:25:44,919
I did it.

1940
05:25:44,919 --> 05:25:59,740
That's unfucking believable.

1941
05:25:59,740 --> 05:26:04,380
When do I get the item?

1942
05:26:04,380 --> 05:26:06,540
I know you didn't do this a bunch of times

1943
05:26:06,540 --> 05:26:08,900
like the other one.

1944
05:26:08,900 --> 05:26:23,669
Oh, why?

1945
05:26:23,669 --> 05:26:24,509
I win.

1946
05:26:24,509 --> 05:26:26,990
I have to win a hundred times?

1947
05:26:26,990 --> 05:26:36,790
No, I don't.

1948
05:26:36,790 --> 05:26:39,509
You have to win up 100 fucking times?

1949
05:26:49,680 --> 05:26:51,240
Welcome to the great guy casino.

1950
05:26:51,240 --> 05:26:52,360
Wanna play the slot machine?

1951
05:26:52,360 --> 05:26:53,200
Absolutely.

1952
05:26:54,580 --> 05:26:55,419
How do I use that?

1953
05:26:55,419 --> 05:26:56,880
How do I do it?

1954
05:26:56,880 --> 05:26:58,479
Costs 10 coins per game.

1955
05:26:58,479 --> 05:26:59,720
Hit it once to start the game.

1956
05:26:59,720 --> 05:27:01,880
Each consecutive hit will freeze one of the pictures.

1957
05:27:01,880 --> 05:27:45,819
Match all three and you might win a frog coin.

1958
05:27:45,819 --> 05:27:50,639
Mushroom, star, star, star, star, star, star, star, star.

1959
05:27:51,479 --> 05:27:52,799
Star, star, star, star, star.

1960
05:27:52,799 --> 05:28:11,340
Oh, you have to jump when you see.

1961
05:28:11,340 --> 05:28:14,020
So now it's, there's no way I can do this one.

1962
05:28:25,360 --> 05:28:27,069
This is it.

1963
05:28:27,069 --> 05:28:28,709
It's rigged.

1964
05:28:28,709 --> 05:28:31,790
So I have to jump when I see the star, right?

1965
05:28:31,790 --> 05:28:35,869
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump.

1966
05:28:35,869 --> 05:28:53,380
Oh my fucking God.

1967
05:28:53,380 --> 05:28:54,220
It's rigged.

1968
05:28:54,220 --> 05:29:03,099
See, okay.

1969
05:29:03,099 --> 05:29:10,229
I thought I timed that pretty well.

1970
05:29:10,229 --> 05:29:12,349
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

1971
05:29:38,610 --> 05:29:39,450
I did it.

1972
05:29:39,450 --> 05:29:40,290
I did it.

1973
05:29:41,330 --> 05:29:51,270
I'll do one more.

1974
05:29:51,270 --> 05:29:52,470
Welcome to Blackjack.

1975
05:29:52,470 --> 05:29:55,340
Let's play around, let's go.

1976
05:29:55,340 --> 05:29:57,099
I don't know, I know how to play Blackjack.

1977
05:29:57,099 --> 05:29:59,020
Don't even tell me.

1978
05:29:59,020 --> 05:30:00,709
Two cards.

1979
05:30:00,709 --> 05:30:04,779
Your first two card, your first card.

1980
05:30:04,779 --> 05:30:06,610
What is it Mario?

1981
05:30:06,610 --> 05:30:09,650
You got a 10.

1982
05:30:09,650 --> 05:30:17,000
Okay, his second card.

1983
05:30:17,000 --> 05:30:20,520
Six, is he gonna get a 16?

1984
05:30:20,520 --> 05:30:23,849
I will draw one card.

1985
05:30:23,849 --> 05:30:27,860
Draw or stay.

1986
05:30:27,860 --> 05:30:31,709
Well, what do you have?

1987
05:30:31,709 --> 05:30:34,450
I can't see what the dealer has for the first,

1988
05:30:34,450 --> 05:30:38,380
I can't see?

1989
05:30:38,419 --> 05:30:43,819
What if you have, what?

1990
05:30:43,819 --> 05:30:51,759
I will draw a card.

1991
05:30:51,759 --> 05:30:54,220
I have 26.

1992
05:30:54,220 --> 05:30:55,619
I broke 21, you won.

1993
05:30:55,619 --> 05:30:56,819
Here's your frog coin.

1994
05:30:57,779 --> 05:31:03,310
Let's go, I'm gonna get a hundred fucking frog coins.

1995
05:31:03,310 --> 05:31:06,080
I have to just take his word for it.

1996
05:31:06,080 --> 05:31:18,040
All right, seven, two.

1997
05:31:18,040 --> 05:31:22,049
I would like to draw.

1998
05:31:22,049 --> 05:31:24,259
I got a seven.

1999
05:31:24,259 --> 05:31:26,299
I'll play with this hand.

2000
05:31:26,299 --> 05:31:28,229
Draw or stay Mario.

2001
05:31:28,229 --> 05:31:29,490
16 again.

2002
05:31:30,490 --> 05:31:32,729
Well, I don't know what he has.

2003
05:31:32,729 --> 05:31:35,419
How am I supposed to know?

2004
05:31:35,860 --> 05:31:40,659
You hit on 16 if you're showing like an eight or a nine,

2005
05:31:40,659 --> 05:31:42,340
seven, eight, nine, 10.

2006
05:31:42,340 --> 05:31:49,119
I don't know what he has.

2007
05:31:49,119 --> 05:31:50,840
All right, I win.

2008
05:31:55,020 --> 05:31:56,759
Just kidding.

2009
05:31:56,759 --> 05:32:06,930
I'll take a frog coin.

2010
05:32:06,930 --> 05:32:11,599
This is the shittiest blackjack ever.

2011
05:32:11,599 --> 05:32:13,200
I thought I had 15 for some dumb reason.

2012
05:32:13,200 --> 05:32:19,099
All right, I got a two.

2013
05:32:19,099 --> 05:32:22,209
I think I should, I'll draw please.

2014
05:32:22,209 --> 05:32:27,389
16 again, against who has any idea.

2015
05:32:27,389 --> 05:32:55,770
I'm gonna stay, of course you do.

2016
05:32:55,810 --> 05:33:00,200
17, I have to stay on 17.

2017
05:33:01,319 --> 05:33:05,220
I don't know what your cards are.

2018
05:33:05,220 --> 05:33:14,319
I don't even like this game.

2019
05:33:14,319 --> 05:33:18,860
Where's my frog coin back?

2020
05:33:18,860 --> 05:33:20,740
Stay on 17 or more?

2021
05:33:20,740 --> 05:33:21,580
That's true.

2022
05:33:23,279 --> 05:33:24,599
But if I could see his card,

2023
05:33:24,599 --> 05:33:26,479
if he had a 10 facing up,

2024
05:33:26,479 --> 05:33:31,270
then you pretty much assume you're gonna lose again.

2025
05:33:31,270 --> 05:33:39,240
That gives him a chance to win.

2026
05:33:39,240 --> 05:33:42,060
Give me another 10.

2027
05:33:42,060 --> 05:33:58,200
Thank you, split.

2028
05:33:58,200 --> 05:34:07,490
All right, am I back to positive again?

2029
05:34:07,529 --> 05:34:10,470
Seven.

2030
05:34:10,470 --> 05:34:16,759
I am at plus one.

2031
05:34:16,759 --> 05:34:18,240
All right, give me another card and make it a 10,

2032
05:34:18,240 --> 05:34:23,139
make it 21, see you later.

2033
05:34:23,139 --> 05:34:25,490
Three, that's great.

2034
05:34:25,490 --> 05:34:29,979
Fantastic.

2035
05:34:29,979 --> 05:34:37,490
I'll stay.

2036
05:34:37,490 --> 05:34:39,569
I have 24, I have plus two, here's your frog coin.

2037
05:34:39,569 --> 05:34:48,520
All right, plus two, right?

2038
05:34:48,520 --> 05:34:51,290
Where's my frog coin?

2039
05:34:51,290 --> 05:34:58,840
46, I was at 50 frog coins.

2040
05:34:58,840 --> 05:35:03,139
Oh, I can't just use it for free.

2041
05:35:03,139 --> 05:35:04,819
I'm actually in my plus two.

2042
05:35:21,669 --> 05:35:23,970
I'm good.

2043
05:35:24,490 --> 05:35:28,490
I want to go look at, I think I want to go,

2044
05:35:28,490 --> 05:35:31,049
I think I want to get the XP ring.

2045
05:35:31,049 --> 05:35:33,060
It's a big purchase.

2046
05:35:33,060 --> 05:35:43,180
Oh, also the Turovsky.

2047
05:35:43,180 --> 05:35:44,659
Doubles experience when equipped.

2048
05:35:44,659 --> 05:35:59,900
That's so, that's amazing.

2049
05:36:01,099 --> 05:36:02,220
Coins is not a big deal,

2050
05:36:02,220 --> 05:36:04,540
but I will just stomp on everything late game

2051
05:36:04,540 --> 05:36:06,459
and it'll just be like, let's go.

2052
05:36:07,979 --> 05:36:10,299
Or I cut FP in half.

2053
05:36:10,299 --> 05:36:13,220
Yeah, I also have to do the fireworks and get the stone.

2054
05:36:16,380 --> 05:36:20,810
Yeah, I also have to do the fireworks and get the stone.

2055
05:36:20,810 --> 05:36:22,169
I'm going for the XP boost.

2056
05:36:22,169 --> 05:36:26,509
It's done, it's too late.

2057
05:36:26,509 --> 05:36:27,709
Who's going to wear it?

2058
05:36:27,709 --> 05:36:48,939
Probably Toadstool.

2059
05:36:48,939 --> 05:36:53,130
All right, that's done.

2060
05:36:53,130 --> 05:36:55,889
I'm going to need to have a ton of boosted up levels

2061
05:36:55,889 --> 05:36:58,970
for the real final boss of the game.

2062
05:37:00,919 --> 05:37:01,840
I need to go get fireworks.

2063
05:37:01,840 --> 05:37:04,439
Now wait, fireworks gives you the stone.

2064
05:37:04,439 --> 05:37:05,520
Stone then is you.

2065
05:37:05,520 --> 05:37:10,240
Okay, so where do I get the fireworks?

2066
05:37:10,240 --> 05:37:21,700
I think it's from mole town, right?

2067
05:37:21,700 --> 05:37:23,020
Who's selling fireworks?

2068
05:37:24,020 --> 05:37:29,279
Oh, there's mushroom guy too.

2069
05:37:29,279 --> 05:37:31,279
A mystery egg, I have no idea what it does.

2070
05:37:31,279 --> 05:37:32,759
It sort of grows on you, huh?

2071
05:37:32,759 --> 05:37:46,939
It's yours for 200 coins, I'll take it.

2072
05:37:46,939 --> 05:37:48,540
You can't get inside Bruce's tower really easily.

2073
05:37:48,540 --> 05:37:51,540
You need a strong person.

2074
05:37:51,540 --> 05:37:52,380
What can I get?

2075
05:37:52,380 --> 05:37:57,970
Who's selling fireworks?

2076
05:37:57,970 --> 05:37:58,810
You're a hero, Mario.

2077
05:37:58,810 --> 05:37:59,650
If it weren't for you,

2078
05:37:59,650 --> 05:38:04,529
Dinah would still be inside that mountain.

2079
05:38:04,529 --> 05:38:12,669
Oh, I wish I had a card about cookie.

2080
05:38:12,669 --> 05:38:13,750
Go to my pretend store.

2081
05:38:13,750 --> 05:38:14,869
Would you like a shiny stone?

2082
05:38:14,869 --> 05:38:16,139
Yes.

2083
05:38:16,139 --> 05:38:17,299
I have you bring me a fireworks

2084
05:38:17,299 --> 05:38:18,819
as you get your shiny stone.

2085
05:38:18,819 --> 05:38:25,349
Who's selling fireworks?

2086
05:38:25,349 --> 05:38:28,099
You?

2087
05:38:28,139 --> 05:38:30,220
Pa fixed the roof up.

2088
05:38:30,220 --> 05:38:31,659
He's singing mobile blues

2089
05:38:31,659 --> 05:38:47,360
and putting in a hard day's work.

2090
05:38:47,360 --> 05:38:52,349
Who's selling fireworks?

2091
05:38:52,349 --> 05:38:53,709
Oh, I think it's you.

2092
05:38:53,709 --> 05:38:54,549
You like fireworks

2093
05:38:54,549 --> 05:38:55,950
and working on my very own invention right now.

2094
05:38:55,950 --> 05:38:57,509
I've only got the sparkles down, but I ain't giving up.

2095
05:38:57,509 --> 05:39:00,389
Want to buy one for 500 coins.

2096
05:39:00,389 --> 05:39:03,669
Well, don't think I'm going to the casino

2097
05:39:03,669 --> 05:39:05,830
for like fucking 30 minutes.

2098
05:39:05,830 --> 05:39:06,990
I can sell some shit.

2099
05:39:30,319 --> 05:39:32,340
I mean, that's the easiest way

2100
05:39:32,340 --> 05:39:50,779
to keep myself out of the casino.

2101
05:39:50,779 --> 05:39:58,419
I don't think I need it for anything.

2102
05:39:58,419 --> 05:39:59,819
I, yeah, there's still an item.

2103
05:39:59,819 --> 05:40:00,900
I'm not gonna beat,

2104
05:40:00,939 --> 05:40:18,509
I'm not going to do that a hundred times.

2105
05:40:18,509 --> 05:40:19,990
Damn, that's a lot of money.

2106
05:40:35,540 --> 05:40:36,819
I'm keeping these moldy mushrooms

2107
05:40:36,819 --> 05:40:44,349
for the guy, the mushroom dude.

2108
05:40:44,349 --> 05:40:45,189
What the hell am I gonna,

2109
05:40:45,189 --> 05:40:56,779
should I just sell a Carol, Carol, Cola?

2110
05:40:56,779 --> 05:40:58,020
I mean, it's a full recovery.

2111
05:40:58,020 --> 05:41:00,919
That's not a good idea.

2112
05:41:00,919 --> 05:41:05,459
Remember, this is just like Resident Evil 2.

2113
05:41:05,459 --> 05:41:08,419
I'm going to hold onto these Carol, Carol, Colas

2114
05:41:08,419 --> 05:41:09,900
until the credits roll.

2115
05:41:09,900 --> 05:41:23,340
I will never use them.

2116
05:41:23,340 --> 05:41:37,389
I can, I can get that money.

2117
05:41:37,389 --> 05:41:53,060
It's over.

2118
05:41:53,060 --> 05:41:54,139
$500.

2119
05:41:54,139 --> 05:41:57,279
Thank you.

2120
05:41:57,279 --> 05:41:59,400
Fireworks for the shiny stone.

2121
05:41:59,400 --> 05:42:01,279
And then you guys are going to get a sneak peek

2122
05:42:01,279 --> 05:42:05,299
for those of you who have never seen it before.

2123
05:42:05,299 --> 05:42:06,500
Welcome to my pretend store.

2124
05:42:06,500 --> 05:42:07,619
Would you like a shiny stone?

2125
05:42:07,619 --> 05:42:09,060
Yes.

2126
05:42:09,060 --> 05:42:10,259
You'll trade your fireworks?

2127
05:42:10,259 --> 05:42:11,419
Yes.

2128
05:42:11,419 --> 05:42:12,259
Thank you.

2129
05:42:12,259 --> 05:42:14,569
Please come again.

2130
05:42:14,569 --> 05:42:22,340
Shiny stone.

2131
05:42:22,340 --> 05:42:23,560
I got it.

2132
05:42:23,560 --> 05:42:24,599
Let's go see.

2133
05:42:24,599 --> 05:42:25,439
I'm going to save the game

2134
05:42:25,439 --> 05:42:26,599
so you can see what's happening here,

2135
05:42:26,599 --> 05:42:28,639
but you don't even need to, it's cool.

2136
05:42:28,639 --> 05:42:29,479
It's all cool.

2137
05:42:37,419 --> 05:42:39,720
Here we go.

2138
05:42:39,720 --> 05:42:42,400
A sneak peek preview of the hardest boss in the game.

2139
05:42:43,240 --> 05:42:54,099
Giving fireworks to little kids.

2140
05:42:54,099 --> 05:42:55,060
I didn't even think about that.

2141
05:42:55,060 --> 05:42:56,590
All right, here we go.

2142
05:42:56,590 --> 05:42:59,750
You ready?

2143
05:42:59,750 --> 05:43:01,540
It's been sealed.

2144
05:43:01,540 --> 05:43:04,419
Look, the shiny stone is reacting.

2145
05:43:04,419 --> 05:43:18,259
The seal has been broken.

2146
05:43:18,259 --> 05:43:20,180
Greetings.

2147
05:43:20,180 --> 05:43:24,419
I am Kuulix, dark knight of thunder.

2148
05:43:25,880 --> 05:43:27,599
I have crossed into this dimension

2149
05:43:27,599 --> 05:43:29,279
to fight for the dark mage,

2150
05:43:31,299 --> 05:43:34,180
but this world is uninhabitable for me and my kind.

2151
05:43:35,360 --> 05:43:41,580
I must return to my own world before I go though.

2152
05:43:41,580 --> 05:43:45,569
I would like to challenge your strongest knight.

2153
05:43:45,569 --> 05:43:49,299
Will you accept my challenge?

2154
05:43:49,299 --> 05:43:53,389
Will you enter combat against me?

2155
05:43:53,389 --> 05:43:55,389
Sure, what can go wrong?

2156
05:43:55,389 --> 05:43:56,229
Unguard.

2157
05:44:00,040 --> 05:44:02,159
I am matter.

2158
05:44:02,159 --> 05:44:03,720
I am anti-matter.

2159
05:44:03,720 --> 05:44:07,040
I can see your past and I can see your future.

2160
05:44:07,040 --> 05:44:12,040
I consume time and I will consume you.

2161
05:44:41,349 --> 05:44:46,209
That hurts.

2162
05:44:46,209 --> 05:44:49,459
Goodbye, Jano.

2163
05:44:49,459 --> 05:44:50,779
Mario's dead here, too.

2164
05:44:50,779 --> 05:44:52,250
Goodbye.

2165
05:44:52,250 --> 05:44:55,509
That was a one hit kill from pretty much full health.

2166
05:44:55,509 --> 05:44:58,430
And that peach is still alive.

2167
05:44:58,430 --> 05:45:19,659
No.

2168
05:45:19,659 --> 05:45:27,970
Dead.

2169
05:45:27,970 --> 05:45:29,770
I didn't beat him first try as promised.

2170
05:45:29,770 --> 05:45:32,770
No, no, but that's not, that wasn't a real first try.

2171
05:45:34,090 --> 05:45:37,340
I wanted you to see the character.

2172
05:45:37,340 --> 05:45:40,630
That didn't count, I wanted you to see it.

2173
05:45:40,630 --> 05:45:44,790
That's a sneak peek.

2174
05:45:44,790 --> 05:45:47,229
No, I just walked in there with no armor on

2175
05:45:47,750 --> 05:45:50,029
and just took my helmet off and said,

2176
05:45:50,029 --> 05:45:52,110
shoot a bolt of lightning at my face.

2177
05:45:52,110 --> 05:45:52,950
I'll be back.

2178
05:45:52,950 --> 05:45:54,150
I didn't even try to fight.

2179
05:46:05,090 --> 05:46:08,090
Cause that's not even the party I would go in with.

2180
05:46:08,090 --> 05:46:11,709
That is, but yes, that's the hardest boss in the game.

2181
05:46:11,709 --> 05:46:14,310
Even the actual true final encounter

2182
05:46:14,310 --> 05:46:15,709
to get the credits to roll is,

2183
05:46:15,709 --> 05:46:18,229
that is probably 10 times harder than that.

2184
05:46:18,229 --> 05:46:19,590
Like that fight right there.

2185
05:46:25,259 --> 05:46:28,069
Let's head back here.

2186
05:46:28,069 --> 05:46:30,150
So that leaves us with, let me see,

2187
05:46:30,150 --> 05:46:31,990
we got a Nimbus land, what do we got left?

2188
05:46:31,990 --> 05:46:33,750
Let me get a look at the whole map.

2189
05:46:34,709 --> 05:46:36,549
I think I can, how do I get out?

2190
05:46:36,549 --> 05:46:42,060
I don't know, get back up.

2191
05:46:42,060 --> 05:46:43,139
Isn't it like a L and R?

2192
05:46:43,139 --> 05:46:44,580
How do I get like a full view?

2193
05:46:51,180 --> 05:46:54,240
I don't know there's a way to do it.

2194
05:46:54,240 --> 05:46:56,720
Up, down, left, how do I get out of this?

2195
05:46:56,720 --> 05:47:12,299
I want to see what's left.

2196
05:47:12,299 --> 05:47:14,979
Oh, there we go.

2197
05:47:14,979 --> 05:47:19,060
All right, so we have, from here,

2198
05:47:19,060 --> 05:47:21,340
we've gone through all this.

2199
05:47:21,340 --> 05:47:24,669
We're currently about right here in Nimbus land.

2200
05:47:24,669 --> 05:47:26,630
Nimbus land, we've probably got,

2201
05:47:26,630 --> 05:47:28,310
we've probably got about,

2202
05:47:28,310 --> 05:47:30,349
yeah, like probably like another four or five hours,

2203
05:47:30,349 --> 05:47:31,189
I would say.

2204
05:47:33,000 --> 05:47:33,840
So what I'm going to do,

2205
05:47:33,840 --> 05:47:40,060
I think that's probably going to be it for tonight.

2206
05:47:40,060 --> 05:47:41,459
No, I want to clean up a couple other things,

2207
05:47:41,459 --> 05:47:49,400
but that's it for like game progression.

2208
05:47:49,400 --> 05:47:50,759
I'm going to clean up a couple of the other

2209
05:47:50,759 --> 05:47:56,799
small little things that I want to do.

2210
05:47:56,799 --> 05:47:58,000
We're about 10 p.m. Pacific,

2211
05:47:58,000 --> 05:47:59,759
we're getting about 1 a.m. Eastern.

2212
05:48:03,020 --> 05:48:07,060
Did Phylactery Lich just get 49 more subs?

2213
05:48:07,060 --> 05:48:10,770
You madman.

2214
05:48:10,770 --> 05:48:12,409
You've lost your mind.

2215
05:48:12,409 --> 05:48:16,090
Another 50 subs from Phylactery Lich.

2216
05:48:16,090 --> 05:48:17,090
Holy shit.

2217
05:48:21,099 --> 05:48:22,380
Thank you so much Phylactery

2218
05:48:22,380 --> 05:48:27,299
in your insane contributions.

2219
05:48:27,299 --> 05:48:29,659
This over here is the most,

2220
05:48:29,659 --> 05:48:33,459
probably most fun of the whole game.

2221
05:48:33,459 --> 05:48:37,299
There is this interesting,

2222
05:48:37,299 --> 05:48:39,900
there's an interesting puzzle mechanic in here,

2223
05:48:39,900 --> 05:48:43,459
where you pick a series of rooms and a series of doors,

2224
05:48:43,459 --> 05:48:44,860
and it's very, very odd,

2225
05:48:44,860 --> 05:48:48,180
very interesting, cool things to do.

2226
05:48:48,180 --> 05:48:54,900
Just this part in here is probably about an hour or two.

2227
05:48:54,900 --> 05:48:56,220
This is probably about two hours,

2228
05:48:56,220 --> 05:48:57,659
maybe like an hour and a half, two hours,

2229
05:48:57,659 --> 05:49:03,959
and then like probably two hours here, two and a half.

2230
05:49:03,959 --> 05:49:10,159
So I think I'd want to do this on another stream,

2231
05:49:11,080 --> 05:49:12,290
but I'm not done yet,

2232
05:49:12,290 --> 05:49:16,259
because I'm going to go do the Game Boy thing.

2233
05:49:16,259 --> 05:49:17,099
And that's all right.

2234
05:49:17,099 --> 05:49:20,180
And then Kool-X as well, which that might take a while.

2235
05:49:20,180 --> 05:49:30,700
I might die a few times depending on how I approach it.

2236
05:49:30,700 --> 05:49:33,950
Where's the little, where's the game kid?

2237
05:49:33,950 --> 05:49:36,189
Merrymore?

2238
05:49:36,189 --> 05:49:39,360
Rosetown, where's the little kid?

2239
05:49:39,360 --> 05:49:45,360
Merrymore, right?

2240
05:49:45,360 --> 05:49:53,400
No, it's all the way in the beginning.

2241
05:49:53,400 --> 05:49:55,080
And the mushroom guy, that's right.

2242
05:49:55,080 --> 05:50:07,130
I got to go back to mushroom guy.

2243
05:50:07,130 --> 05:50:10,029
Where is he? In the corner over here?

2244
05:50:10,029 --> 05:50:11,990
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2245
05:50:11,990 --> 05:50:13,389
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2246
05:50:13,389 --> 05:50:15,029
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2247
05:50:15,029 --> 05:50:17,349
All right, yes, I'm done.

2248
05:50:18,270 --> 05:50:20,349
You want this for 500 coins.

2249
05:50:23,470 --> 05:50:25,619
Suit yourself.

2250
05:50:25,619 --> 05:50:38,450
God damn it, I need to sell more stuff.

2251
05:50:38,450 --> 05:50:47,369
I need 500 coins.

2252
05:50:47,369 --> 05:50:51,950
About to do it.

2253
05:50:51,950 --> 05:51:00,520
Quickest way you can get money.

2254
05:51:00,520 --> 05:51:03,400
Safety badge is 250, but it's really,

2255
05:51:03,400 --> 05:51:07,360
the ghost medal is really useful too.

2256
05:51:07,360 --> 05:51:09,720
I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm selling the card.

2257
05:51:09,720 --> 05:51:11,650
It's gone.

2258
05:51:11,650 --> 05:51:12,689
Say goodbye to the card.

2259
05:51:12,689 --> 05:51:25,700
I'm not going to that casino anymore.

2260
05:51:25,700 --> 05:51:29,959
Ah, I can't do it.

2261
05:51:29,959 --> 05:51:33,220
I just need to go make some cash.

2262
05:51:33,220 --> 05:51:39,450
Who cares?

2263
05:51:39,450 --> 05:51:41,259
I'm selling.

2264
05:51:41,259 --> 05:51:43,790
Like, I'm not going to use these.

2265
05:51:43,790 --> 05:52:21,900
I'm not, I know it because I've got peach.

2266
05:52:21,900 --> 05:52:24,159
I'm back.

2267
05:52:24,159 --> 05:52:26,400
I'll take it, 500 coins.

2268
05:52:26,400 --> 05:52:27,319
Want me to teach you?

2269
05:52:27,319 --> 05:52:28,880
Yes.

2270
05:52:28,880 --> 05:52:31,080
High score if you hit the shells with the stars

2271
05:52:31,080 --> 05:52:35,900
fired from the beetle.

2272
05:52:35,900 --> 05:52:38,139
If you get hit, recover by firing consecutively.

2273
05:52:38,139 --> 05:52:45,970
Just do it.

2274
05:52:46,009 --> 05:52:49,049
Select game on the menu and you can play beetle mania,

2275
05:52:49,049 --> 05:52:54,479
but please be sure not to cheat with the turbo type controller.

2276
05:52:54,479 --> 05:53:00,080
I'll try.

2277
05:53:00,080 --> 05:53:10,310
What happened?

2278
05:53:10,310 --> 05:53:23,279
Why am I getting hit by it?

2279
05:53:23,279 --> 05:53:24,119
What's going on?

2280
05:53:26,580 --> 05:53:35,099
Oh, the red stars are hitting me.

2281
05:53:35,099 --> 05:53:49,049
You want to hit them when they're highest.

2282
05:53:49,049 --> 05:53:51,889
Am I actually going to do this to 5,000 points?

2283
05:53:56,860 --> 05:53:58,349
I should just wait.

2284
05:53:58,349 --> 05:54:01,060
Wait till there's a bunch on the screen.

2285
05:54:01,060 --> 05:54:07,569
Start a chain reaction.

2286
05:54:07,569 --> 05:54:08,770
I got to beat this kid's high score.

2287
05:54:08,770 --> 05:54:09,610
I have to.

2288
05:54:20,740 --> 05:54:27,490
All right, you got to get the combo.

2289
05:54:27,490 --> 05:54:30,090
Oh, my screen just, I guess lagged.

2290
05:54:40,900 --> 05:54:42,979
Holy shit, I just got so many.

2291
05:54:42,979 --> 05:54:48,569
How many points did I just get?

2292
05:54:48,569 --> 05:54:56,900
What just happened?

2293
05:54:56,900 --> 05:55:02,360
I think I broke the game.

2294
05:55:02,360 --> 05:55:09,310
I just got 146,000 points.

2295
05:55:09,310 --> 05:55:11,150
Can I, now can I like turn it over to the kid

2296
05:55:11,150 --> 05:55:14,189
and be like, I did this in 10 minutes.

2297
05:55:14,189 --> 05:55:29,569
You've been here for weeks, kid.

2298
05:55:29,569 --> 05:55:35,919
I'm going to stay in the corner.

2299
05:55:35,919 --> 05:55:45,380
Oh shit.

2300
05:55:45,380 --> 05:55:47,819
Nice.

2301
05:55:47,860 --> 05:55:52,869
I got to get as many on the screen as I can.

2302
05:55:52,869 --> 05:56:01,540
No, no, no, no.

2303
05:56:01,540 --> 05:56:15,750
Damn it.

2304
05:56:15,750 --> 05:56:18,229
Okay, how many presses does it take?

2305
05:56:18,229 --> 05:56:19,909
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

2306
05:56:19,909 --> 05:56:21,150
Okay, seven.

2307
05:56:21,150 --> 05:56:22,270
Let's just test that theory.

2308
05:56:22,270 --> 05:56:24,189
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

2309
05:56:24,189 --> 05:56:28,950
Okay.

2310
05:56:28,950 --> 05:56:36,590
Three, four, five, six, seven.

2311
05:56:36,590 --> 05:56:45,479
Why did that not work?

2312
05:56:45,479 --> 05:57:02,970
How did I get so many multipliers last time?

2313
05:57:02,970 --> 05:57:09,330
I have no idea how I did that.

2314
05:57:09,330 --> 05:57:10,490
I'm not sure there's an amount of things

2315
05:57:10,490 --> 05:57:12,430
that can be on the screen.

2316
05:57:12,430 --> 05:57:13,250
All right, here we go.

2317
05:57:13,250 --> 05:57:21,819
Let me try it again.

2318
05:57:21,819 --> 05:57:25,490
Last try.

2319
05:57:25,490 --> 05:57:42,630
I mean, I can't really beat 146,000.

2320
05:57:42,630 --> 05:57:45,310
More.

2321
05:57:45,310 --> 05:57:46,389
More.

2322
05:57:46,389 --> 05:57:56,060
More on the screen.

2323
05:57:56,060 --> 05:57:56,900
Shit.

2324
05:58:12,919 --> 05:58:16,720
This music's driving me crazy.

2325
05:58:16,720 --> 05:58:17,799
Come on.

2326
05:58:17,799 --> 05:58:19,439
All right, that was 12,000.

2327
05:58:19,439 --> 05:58:20,279
What's that?

2328
05:58:21,909 --> 05:58:22,750
I didn't even see that.

2329
05:58:22,750 --> 05:58:33,110
What's a heart do?

2330
05:58:33,110 --> 05:58:35,340
Oh, what?

2331
05:58:35,340 --> 05:58:36,180
Come on.

2332
05:58:36,180 --> 05:59:04,340
That wasn't anything.

2333
05:59:04,340 --> 05:59:09,689
String, string, string.

2334
05:59:09,689 --> 05:59:13,180
String.

2335
05:59:13,180 --> 05:59:17,000
Oh, I ran out.

2336
05:59:17,000 --> 05:59:21,340
Last, last, last, last one.

2337
05:59:21,340 --> 05:59:24,220
What the fuck?

2338
05:59:24,220 --> 05:59:25,060
I don't think I'll just,

2339
05:59:25,060 --> 05:59:47,080
the length of this time have anything to do with it.

2340
05:59:47,080 --> 05:59:50,090
You gotta get lucky with the chain.

2341
05:59:50,090 --> 05:59:50,930
We need a bunch on this.

2342
05:59:50,930 --> 05:59:55,819
So you need to get a shitload on the screen without firing.

2343
05:59:55,819 --> 05:59:57,779
More, more, more, more, more, more.

2344
05:59:57,779 --> 06:00:00,900
One, two.

2345
06:00:00,900 --> 06:00:01,740
I kinda did it.

2346
06:00:01,740 --> 06:00:12,930
Okay.

2347
06:00:12,930 --> 06:00:13,750
More.

2348
06:00:13,750 --> 06:00:15,790
All right, that's it.

2349
06:00:15,790 --> 06:00:27,220
Oh.

2350
06:00:27,220 --> 06:00:39,720
All right, not bad.

2351
06:00:39,720 --> 06:00:40,560
Why are they here?

2352
06:00:40,560 --> 06:00:48,610
Did they run into each other?

2353
06:00:48,610 --> 06:00:49,450
Close.

2354
06:00:49,450 --> 06:01:03,779
We're getting there.

2355
06:01:03,779 --> 06:01:04,619
All right, I'm starting to run out.

2356
06:01:04,619 --> 06:01:11,709
I'm running out of juice here.

2357
06:01:11,709 --> 06:01:16,700
Oh.

2358
06:01:16,700 --> 06:01:19,700
Come on.

2359
06:01:19,700 --> 06:01:22,450
No.

2360
06:01:22,450 --> 06:01:23,270
Come on.

2361
06:01:23,270 --> 06:01:24,110
67,000.

2362
06:01:24,110 --> 06:01:27,430
What are you gonna give me?

2363
06:01:27,430 --> 06:01:41,580
Oh, I'm obsessed with this.

2364
06:01:41,580 --> 06:01:43,380
You gotta maximize the beginning.

2365
06:01:43,380 --> 06:01:45,099
So it's seven presses.

2366
06:01:45,099 --> 06:01:46,419
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

2367
06:01:46,419 --> 06:01:47,400
No, it's six.

2368
06:01:50,000 --> 06:01:52,700
Now it's seven.

2369
06:01:52,700 --> 06:01:55,540
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

2370
06:01:55,540 --> 06:02:09,959
Come on.

2371
06:02:09,959 --> 06:02:11,720
Why is 146,000 not enough?

2372
06:02:11,720 --> 06:02:17,599
Cause it's not 150,000.

2373
06:02:17,599 --> 06:02:34,229
That's a huge problem for my brain.

2374
06:02:34,229 --> 06:02:36,330
No, it needs to be clean.

2375
06:02:36,330 --> 06:02:37,810
It needs to be clean.

2376
06:02:37,810 --> 06:02:58,319
This is the actual final try.

2377
06:02:58,319 --> 06:02:59,919
Changes based on who's in the middle of the party.

2378
06:02:59,959 --> 06:03:00,799
I just read that.

2379
06:03:00,799 --> 06:03:13,000
That's pretty damn cool.

2380
06:03:13,000 --> 06:03:25,130
Come on.

2381
06:03:25,130 --> 06:03:36,560
Good one.

2382
06:03:36,560 --> 06:03:38,880
What?

2383
06:03:38,880 --> 06:03:40,479
How did that not get anything?

2384
06:04:02,740 --> 06:04:03,580
Do it.

2385
06:04:12,159 --> 06:04:13,400
Try shooting the corners.

2386
06:04:21,110 --> 06:04:22,310
Oh baby.

2387
06:04:22,310 --> 06:04:32,799
That was fucking pretty good.

2388
06:04:32,799 --> 06:04:41,619
I'm running out of steam.

2389
06:04:41,619 --> 06:04:42,439
This is the one.

2390
06:04:42,439 --> 06:04:43,279
This is the one.

2391
06:04:43,279 --> 06:04:56,580
Give me the heart.

2392
06:04:56,580 --> 06:04:58,880
Oh.

2393
06:04:58,880 --> 06:04:59,720
No, I got it.

2394
06:04:59,720 --> 06:05:00,560
I get it.

2395
06:05:00,560 --> 06:05:01,380
I actually get it.

2396
06:05:01,380 --> 06:05:02,220
I get it now.

2397
06:05:02,220 --> 06:05:09,659
You gotta try to spread it up all the way from the corner.

2398
06:05:09,659 --> 06:05:10,500
Thank you.

2399
06:05:10,500 --> 06:05:18,299
Come on.

2400
06:05:18,299 --> 06:05:19,139
Dammit.

2401
06:05:19,139 --> 06:05:19,979
Switch the background.

2402
06:05:19,979 --> 06:05:20,819
Hold on.

2403
06:05:20,819 --> 06:05:28,680
Not yet.

2404
06:05:28,680 --> 06:05:42,400
Oh, it's never gonna happen again.

2405
06:05:42,400 --> 06:05:43,240
All right.

2406
06:05:43,240 --> 06:05:48,779
I need some more to fill up.

2407
06:05:48,779 --> 06:05:51,110
That's it.

2408
06:05:51,110 --> 06:05:52,229
Oh, you mother.

2409
06:05:52,229 --> 06:05:53,069
What?

2410
06:06:14,479 --> 06:06:16,599
How could you not hit something?

2411
06:06:16,599 --> 06:06:20,639
It's impossible.

2412
06:06:20,639 --> 06:06:24,319
Statistically, you gotta run into somebody.

2413
06:06:24,319 --> 06:06:25,159
Do it.

2414
06:06:26,119 --> 06:06:27,080
You assholes.

2415
06:06:29,819 --> 06:06:54,919
I have to start over.

2416
06:06:54,919 --> 06:06:55,759
All right.

2417
06:06:55,759 --> 06:07:07,459
I'll change the background.

2418
06:07:07,459 --> 06:07:28,200
Actually easier to see this.

2419
06:07:28,200 --> 06:07:29,400
Come on.

2420
06:07:29,400 --> 06:07:43,770
That was a lot.

2421
06:07:43,770 --> 06:07:45,090
Come on.

2422
06:07:45,090 --> 06:07:46,290
It's so hard to breach.

2423
06:07:46,290 --> 06:07:53,110
It's not fair.

2424
06:07:53,110 --> 06:07:53,950
Just don't shoot.

2425
06:07:53,950 --> 06:07:55,869
Well, it's almost impossible not to

2426
06:07:55,869 --> 06:07:59,069
because every button shoots

2427
06:07:59,069 --> 06:08:00,590
and the only way you don't die.

2428
06:08:00,590 --> 06:08:01,549
So when I get hit, right,

2429
06:08:01,549 --> 06:08:05,110
I have to tap shoot to spawn.

2430
06:08:05,110 --> 06:08:06,630
And every time I get hit,

2431
06:08:06,630 --> 06:08:08,110
I have to tap it one more time.

2432
06:08:08,110 --> 06:08:10,830
So one, two, three, four, five, six, right?

2433
06:08:10,830 --> 06:08:13,130
Don't hit it again.

2434
06:08:13,130 --> 06:08:16,529
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

2435
06:08:16,529 --> 06:08:18,169
And eventually you kind of just can't.

2436
06:08:18,169 --> 06:08:23,319
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

2437
06:08:23,319 --> 06:08:57,659
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

2438
06:08:57,659 --> 06:08:58,500
You've got to be.

2439
06:09:01,000 --> 06:09:28,680
You're gonna be kidding me.

2440
06:09:28,680 --> 06:09:30,759
This is so dramatic.

2441
06:09:30,759 --> 06:10:09,189
Is this the one?

2442
06:10:09,189 --> 06:10:10,029
Oh, don't.

2443
06:10:55,040 --> 06:10:57,360
This is more difficult than a casino.

2444
06:10:57,360 --> 06:11:18,240
Yes, it is.

2445
06:11:18,240 --> 06:11:34,750
Shit.

2446
06:11:34,750 --> 06:11:35,590
It's possible.

2447
06:11:35,590 --> 06:11:36,409
You can't dodge it.

2448
06:11:36,409 --> 06:11:53,419
It's impossible.

2449
06:11:53,419 --> 06:11:59,619
Good start.

2450
06:11:59,619 --> 06:12:19,909
Good start.

2451
06:12:19,909 --> 06:12:38,610
Just need two more big ones.

2452
06:12:38,610 --> 06:12:39,849
I'm pressing this shit so fast.

2453
06:12:39,849 --> 06:12:46,279
You have no idea.

2454
06:12:46,279 --> 06:12:51,720
I'm the fucking master.

2455
06:12:51,720 --> 06:13:09,560
Let's get to a goddamn million.

2456
06:13:09,560 --> 06:13:11,240
250, 250, get over there.

2457
06:13:11,240 --> 06:13:12,080
I can get it.

2458
06:13:12,080 --> 06:13:38,849
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

2459
06:13:38,849 --> 06:14:01,810
Give me the heart.

2460
06:14:01,810 --> 06:14:03,180
I did it.

2461
06:14:03,180 --> 06:14:05,060
I got you a fucking million.

2462
06:14:05,060 --> 06:14:22,360
I got you a million.

2463
06:14:22,360 --> 06:14:26,509
Two million.

2464
06:14:26,509 --> 06:14:50,630
My arm hurts so much.

2465
06:14:50,630 --> 06:14:51,470
No.

2466
06:14:51,470 --> 06:15:09,729
That's a two million fucking books.

2467
06:15:09,729 --> 06:15:10,569
Give me two million.

2468
06:15:10,569 --> 06:15:23,740
Give me 10 million.

2469
06:15:23,740 --> 06:15:45,680
Oh.

2470
06:15:51,419 --> 06:15:53,380
He's gone insane.

2471
06:15:53,380 --> 06:15:54,580
I lost my mind.

2472
06:15:55,419 --> 06:16:17,450
We're gonna have two million points.

2473
06:16:17,450 --> 06:16:21,400
It's not gonna end.

2474
06:16:21,400 --> 06:16:22,680
I've reached the point of like no return

2475
06:16:22,680 --> 06:16:23,639
where it's impossible for me to lose

2476
06:16:23,639 --> 06:16:45,560
and I'm gonna get like a hundred million points.

2477
06:16:45,560 --> 06:16:47,200
No, that's not a good strategy.

2478
06:16:47,200 --> 06:16:51,740
You gotta get them when they're bouncing around.

2479
06:16:51,740 --> 06:17:07,729
Like that.

2480
06:17:07,729 --> 06:17:11,430
I'm doing this in front of the high score kid.

2481
06:17:11,430 --> 06:17:12,630
I'm just cackling.

2482
06:17:12,630 --> 06:17:14,430
He got 5,000 points.

2483
06:17:14,430 --> 06:17:32,380
Get on my level, you little bastard.

2484
06:17:32,380 --> 06:17:33,220
All right, five million

2485
06:17:33,220 --> 06:17:38,069
and I've ripped the fucking ethernet code out of my computer.

2486
06:17:38,069 --> 06:17:49,790
I have to stop.

2487
06:17:49,790 --> 06:17:50,630
You know what I'm saying?

2488
06:17:50,630 --> 06:17:56,360
Like at some point you gotta just call it a day.

2489
06:17:56,360 --> 06:17:57,360
Holy shit.

2490
06:17:58,200 --> 06:17:59,680
It's 999.

2491
06:17:59,680 --> 06:18:03,369
It can't even go any higher.

2492
06:18:03,369 --> 06:18:05,090
That was max combo right there.

2493
06:18:25,090 --> 06:18:29,360
And I thought 5,000 was hard.

2494
06:18:29,360 --> 06:18:31,240
Once you get to this point,

2495
06:18:31,240 --> 06:18:32,840
it's just impossible to lose.

2496
06:18:44,430 --> 06:18:47,000
Five million, that's it.

2497
06:18:47,000 --> 06:18:50,319
I think five million is a number that is just perfect.

2498
06:18:50,319 --> 06:18:51,159
You know what I'm saying?

2499
06:18:51,159 --> 06:19:10,950
It's a perfect number.

2500
06:19:10,950 --> 06:19:13,400
Get exactly five million.

2501
06:19:13,400 --> 06:19:15,560
That's impossible.

2502
06:19:15,560 --> 06:19:18,919
Actually, it might not be.

2503
06:19:18,919 --> 06:19:20,840
No, that is actually possible.

2504
06:19:20,840 --> 06:19:22,240
I'm gonna go for it.

2505
06:19:22,240 --> 06:19:43,939
Good idea.

2506
06:19:43,939 --> 06:19:45,139
Why is it slowing down?

2507
06:19:45,139 --> 06:19:46,700
Am I just getting slow?

2508
06:19:46,700 --> 06:19:48,639
Am I getting tired?

2509
06:19:48,639 --> 06:19:57,459
I can't tell.

2510
06:19:57,459 --> 06:20:15,689
I didn't chain these over 99999.

2511
06:20:15,689 --> 06:20:16,930
Five million, exactly.

2512
06:20:16,930 --> 06:20:18,250
Five million points.

2513
06:20:28,330 --> 06:20:31,319
3.8 million, almost there.

2514
06:20:31,319 --> 06:20:45,430
This all wasn't for nothing, I promise.

2515
06:20:45,430 --> 06:20:53,810
Get to four, come on.

2516
06:20:53,810 --> 06:20:54,650
I just love that.

2517
06:20:54,650 --> 06:20:56,169
I like the sound that it makes.

2518
06:20:57,909 --> 06:21:07,049
I'm a bug to a light bulb.

2519
06:21:07,049 --> 06:21:08,729
All right, here we go.

2520
06:21:08,729 --> 06:21:10,799
I gotta be careful here.

2521
06:21:10,799 --> 06:21:13,080
Five, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.

2522
06:21:21,619 --> 06:21:22,659
Easy.

2523
06:21:22,659 --> 06:21:35,099
Don't do too good.

2524
06:21:35,099 --> 06:21:43,849
That's pretty damn good.

2525
06:21:43,849 --> 06:21:45,400
How much is one?

2526
06:21:45,400 --> 06:21:48,119
How much is one?

2527
06:21:48,119 --> 06:21:49,400
I have to start shooting them, right?

2528
06:21:49,400 --> 06:21:51,080
Let's see, it's like 70.

2529
06:21:51,080 --> 06:22:00,599
I can do it.

2530
06:22:00,599 --> 06:22:04,740
I almost blew it there.

2531
06:22:04,740 --> 06:22:06,139
Holy fuck, okay.

2532
06:22:06,139 --> 06:22:11,830
It's still going.

2533
06:22:11,830 --> 06:22:13,310
4.8, we're almost there.

2534
06:22:13,310 --> 06:22:15,709
It's almost time.

2535
06:22:15,709 --> 06:22:18,779
Okay, 4.8.

2536
06:22:18,779 --> 06:22:22,060
I gotta start to shoot them on my own now.

2537
06:22:22,060 --> 06:22:30,240
No, not yet.

2538
06:22:30,240 --> 06:22:47,970
Oh, shit.

2539
06:22:48,130 --> 06:22:51,040
Okay, I understand if you have to leave.

2540
06:22:51,040 --> 06:22:52,959
If you wanna leave, I get it.

2541
06:22:52,959 --> 06:22:53,799
I really do.

2542
06:22:53,799 --> 06:22:54,720
I get it.

2543
06:22:54,720 --> 06:22:56,689
Trust me, I do.

2544
06:22:56,689 --> 06:23:00,689
But I'm going for 10 million.

2545
06:23:00,689 --> 06:23:11,869
Keep away from my internet cord.

2546
06:23:11,869 --> 06:23:15,169
I wanna see if it goes to 10 million.

2547
06:23:15,169 --> 06:23:16,610
It might not even go to 10 million.

2548
06:23:16,610 --> 06:23:25,849
It might break at 999,999,000.

2549
06:23:25,849 --> 06:23:26,810
We're fine.

2550
06:23:26,810 --> 06:23:32,250
I'm gonna do it very good.

2551
06:23:32,250 --> 06:23:51,200
There we go, it's gonna be like six million right there.

2552
06:23:51,200 --> 06:23:52,040
Five and a half million.

2553
06:23:52,040 --> 06:23:54,540
What if I do five, five, five, five, five?

2554
06:23:54,540 --> 06:24:20,099
I'm gonna go five, five, five, five, five, five, five.

2555
06:24:20,139 --> 06:24:23,209
What the fuck happened?

2556
06:24:23,209 --> 06:24:26,740
I like blacked out.

2557
06:24:26,740 --> 06:24:28,419
Okay, I like kind of blacked out there.

2558
06:24:28,419 --> 06:24:33,330
I like, my brain just, I turned off.

2559
06:24:33,330 --> 06:24:35,049
Five, 55 million.

2560
06:24:35,049 --> 06:24:35,889
5.5.

2561
06:24:37,270 --> 06:24:38,270
All right, one more.

2562
06:24:46,919 --> 06:24:49,380
I'm kidding.

2563
06:24:49,380 --> 06:24:50,220
That's 10.

2564
06:24:50,220 --> 06:24:58,259
That's five and a half million, come on.

2565
06:24:58,259 --> 06:25:10,080
See you around, kid.

2566
06:25:10,080 --> 06:25:13,740
I'm gonna teach you.

2567
06:25:13,740 --> 06:25:22,750
Trust me, kid, I already know.

2568
06:25:22,750 --> 06:25:25,639
I don't get anything from doing the high score?

2569
06:25:25,639 --> 06:25:27,529
No, well.

2570
06:25:27,529 --> 06:25:28,849
Well, that's it.

2571
06:25:30,490 --> 06:25:32,290
You ruined his life.

2572
06:25:32,290 --> 06:25:34,040
No, I didn't.

2573
06:25:34,040 --> 06:25:34,880
There are plenty of games.

2574
06:25:34,880 --> 06:25:36,799
He's probably way better than me at Fortnite.

2575
06:25:36,799 --> 06:25:37,639
I guarantee it.

2576
06:25:50,060 --> 06:25:51,099
He still has the Game Boy.

2577
06:25:51,099 --> 06:25:53,319
Yeah, I handed it back to him.

2578
06:25:53,319 --> 06:25:56,000
I was like, take it, egg-o-kid.

2579
06:25:56,000 --> 06:25:57,240
Try to beat that.

2580
06:25:57,240 --> 06:25:59,439
And it's just the both handles

2581
06:25:59,439 --> 06:26:01,939
are just covered in greasy fingerprints.

2582
06:26:01,939 --> 06:26:04,779
His screen just has fingerprints all over it.

2583
06:26:04,779 --> 06:26:07,180
Potato chip fucking hands all over his A button.

2584
06:26:08,099 --> 06:26:09,900
His B button is smushed in

2585
06:26:09,900 --> 06:26:11,380
and you have to mirror over it

2586
06:26:11,380 --> 06:26:13,979
and press down hard to even have it register.

2587
06:26:26,560 --> 06:26:30,450
I'll see you later.

2588
06:26:30,450 --> 06:26:32,360
That's the end of the stream.

2589
06:26:32,360 --> 06:26:34,360
Well, not technically the complete end,

2590
06:26:34,360 --> 06:26:39,529
but the end of this portion.

2591
06:26:39,529 --> 06:26:40,569
I do have to take my headphone out

2592
06:26:40,569 --> 06:26:41,409
because that's all I can,

2593
06:26:41,409 --> 06:26:44,009
I can't hear any of the sounds besides that now.

2594
06:26:44,130 --> 06:26:47,130
Oh, next up is Terraria now.

2595
06:26:47,130 --> 06:26:50,130
So I'll see you guys, what's today?

2596
06:26:50,130 --> 06:26:55,500
I'll see you guys probably on Thursday.

2597
06:26:55,500 --> 06:27:00,090
Thursday, we'll go again.

2598
06:27:00,090 --> 06:27:00,930
End of the stream, beatbox.

2599
06:27:00,930 --> 06:27:03,889
I don't think I can.

2600
06:27:03,889 --> 06:27:08,939
Time for the Terraria.

2601
06:27:08,939 --> 06:27:10,580
No Jerma all week.

2602
06:27:10,580 --> 06:27:18,430
Hey, it's Monday.

2603
06:27:18,430 --> 06:27:26,709
Today's Monday and Thursday is still this week

2604
06:27:26,709 --> 06:27:29,409
and Friday is still this week, too.

2605
06:27:29,409 --> 06:27:31,990
But I'll see you guys on Thursday.

2606
06:27:31,990 --> 06:27:33,830
I'll see you guys on Thursday.

2607
06:27:33,869 --> 06:27:38,380
And Friday is still this week, too.

2608
06:27:38,380 --> 06:27:40,220
But I love these Mario RPG streams.

2609
06:27:40,220 --> 06:27:42,619
They are just fun to relax and just play a game

2610
06:27:42,619 --> 06:27:44,099
I know everything about.

2611
06:27:44,099 --> 06:27:51,279
Well, like 90% of everything.

2612
06:27:51,279 --> 06:27:52,439
Thanks for sticking around, guys.

2613
06:27:52,439 --> 06:27:57,459
We will complete Mario RPG on the next stream.

2614
06:27:58,340 --> 06:27:59,659
But because it's probably only gonna be

2615
06:27:59,659 --> 06:28:00,939
another three or four hours,

2616
06:28:00,939 --> 06:28:02,979
I'm gonna do something else, too.

2617
06:28:02,979 --> 06:28:04,220
We might open with something

2618
06:28:04,220 --> 06:28:11,270
or we might open with this and close with something else

2619
06:28:11,270 --> 06:28:12,349
because it's not gonna be more,

2620
06:28:12,349 --> 06:28:17,360
because this is, the game's only about 15 to 18 plus.

2621
06:28:17,360 --> 06:28:22,430
So it's only about three or four more hours left.

2622
06:28:22,430 --> 06:28:25,509
Unless, yeah, unless Kool-X is an insanely hard thing

2623
06:28:25,509 --> 06:28:31,189
that I can't do, which I think I should be able to.

2624
06:28:31,189 --> 06:28:32,709
So this is Thursday,

2625
06:28:32,709 --> 06:28:40,040
the same time around three to four o'clock Pacific.

2626
06:28:40,040 --> 06:28:43,479
We will be doing potentially two things on Thursday,

2627
06:28:43,479 --> 06:28:45,990
finishing this up and something else.

2628
06:28:45,990 --> 06:28:46,830
Thank you for joining me.

2629
06:28:46,830 --> 06:28:47,909
See you guys later.

2630
06:28:47,909 --> 06:28:51,369
Have a good next couple of days.

2631
06:28:51,369 --> 06:28:55,180
Let's rewind back to earlier this evening.

2632
06:28:55,180 --> 06:28:57,779
We had some subs and some bits and all that stuff.

2633
06:29:01,049 --> 06:29:03,130
Sergelbutt gave 250.

2634
06:29:03,130 --> 06:29:06,990
They say, please clap.

2635
06:29:06,990 --> 06:29:13,250
I did.

2636
06:29:13,250 --> 06:29:16,029
Thank you, whole of one zombie for the 250.

2637
06:29:16,029 --> 06:29:18,630
My team understands the German mug pitched to you

2638
06:29:18,630 --> 06:29:20,860
wasn't up to scratch.

2639
06:29:20,860 --> 06:29:23,919
Here's at It's a Bitcrap.

2640
06:29:23,919 --> 06:29:26,560
We pride ourselves on groundbreaking designs.

2641
06:29:26,560 --> 06:29:28,439
We hope this new batch suits your requirements.

2642
06:29:28,439 --> 06:29:30,360
Look forward to working with you.

2643
06:29:30,360 --> 06:29:50,340
Out of my ass.

2644
06:29:50,340 --> 06:29:51,540
No one would buy this.

2645
06:29:52,540 --> 06:29:57,520
I was like, you know, I thought about a while back.

2646
06:29:57,520 --> 06:30:03,450
I was gonna do the German old emote as an iPhone case,

2647
06:30:03,450 --> 06:30:18,020
but then I realized no one would buy it.

2648
06:30:18,020 --> 06:30:20,459
And I know that people will say, no, I would.

2649
06:30:20,459 --> 06:30:23,340
That would be so funny.

2650
06:30:23,340 --> 06:30:25,099
I would open up like my Teespring account.

2651
06:30:25,099 --> 06:30:27,700
It'd be like 11 purchases over like five weeks.

2652
06:30:33,639 --> 06:30:34,479
So I was like, yeah,

2653
06:30:34,479 --> 06:30:42,400
maybe it's not worth like the cost to do it.

2654
06:30:42,400 --> 06:30:44,520
I'm not sure what the top one is.

2655
06:30:45,040 --> 06:30:45,959
That's a wallet down there.

2656
06:30:45,959 --> 06:30:46,799
Those are sneakers.

2657
06:30:46,799 --> 06:30:47,639
But what is the top one?

2658
06:30:47,639 --> 06:30:49,709
Is it a t-shirt?

2659
06:30:49,709 --> 06:30:52,110
Just a really, really shitty t-shirt.

2660
06:30:55,340 --> 06:30:58,930
It's not even the right way.

2661
06:30:58,930 --> 06:31:00,290
That's a tie?

2662
06:31:00,290 --> 06:31:02,529
Oh, I thought the guy,

2663
06:31:02,529 --> 06:31:06,130
I thought it was an open shirt with a white t-shirt.

2664
06:31:06,130 --> 06:31:07,569
And that was at the bottom.

2665
06:31:07,569 --> 06:31:14,930
Like that gross old man's stomach fanny pack.

2666
06:31:14,930 --> 06:31:24,970
I was like, why that t-shirt sucks?

2667
06:31:24,970 --> 06:31:27,009
Thank you though for this.

2668
06:31:27,009 --> 06:31:32,349
I will not be using any of them.

2669
06:31:32,590 --> 06:31:33,549
Did I save the game?

2670
06:31:33,549 --> 06:31:34,389
I did, right?

2671
06:31:34,389 --> 06:31:38,419
Let me make sure I did.

2672
06:31:38,419 --> 06:31:44,869
But thank you, Whole of One Zombie, appreciate it.

2673
06:31:44,869 --> 06:31:47,840
And power down.

2674
06:31:47,840 --> 06:31:51,119
Also, thank you to SirK9 for the $5.

2675
06:31:51,119 --> 06:31:52,959
Hey Jerma, it's Kevin's mom again.

2676
06:31:52,959 --> 06:31:54,479
I don't appreciate you trying to censor me

2677
06:31:54,479 --> 06:31:56,000
from your audience about how you caused

2678
06:31:56,000 --> 06:31:58,080
serious injuries to my son.

2679
06:31:58,080 --> 06:31:59,639
It's gotten worse.

2680
06:31:59,639 --> 06:32:02,200
And now all he does is he sings and plays

2681
06:32:02,200 --> 06:32:04,639
and dances to the Han Solo song from Star Wars.

2682
06:32:04,639 --> 06:32:10,909
I hope you're happy.

2683
06:32:10,909 --> 06:32:14,860
Kevin, listen to your mother.

2684
06:32:14,860 --> 06:32:15,700
Listen to your mother, Kevin.

2685
06:32:15,700 --> 06:32:19,029
I know you're watching.

2686
06:32:19,029 --> 06:32:22,319
Listen to your mother, see?

2687
06:32:22,319 --> 06:32:24,740
I helped.

2688
06:32:24,740 --> 06:32:29,740
Thank you to Allie, Allie Titian with the $10, Allie.

2689
06:32:31,200 --> 06:32:33,869
$10 and 15 cents.

2690
06:32:33,869 --> 06:32:38,709
Thank you, appreciate it.

2691
06:32:38,709 --> 06:32:41,830
No message, just thousand bits.

2692
06:32:41,830 --> 06:32:44,450
Thank you.

2693
06:32:44,450 --> 06:32:50,139
Thank you Drumajor, or Drumage Door, for the $2.50.

2694
06:32:51,360 --> 06:32:52,360
I had a dream a couple days ago

2695
06:32:52,360 --> 06:32:53,479
in which I was making music

2696
06:32:53,479 --> 06:32:55,439
and you were commentating to it

2697
06:32:55,439 --> 06:32:59,000
with the LOL epic YouTuber style

2698
06:32:59,000 --> 06:33:00,959
that made me remember what the heck happened to that.

2699
06:33:00,959 --> 06:33:03,200
I'm gonna make my own music stream

2700
06:33:03,200 --> 06:33:04,840
as we're looking forward to it.

2701
06:33:04,840 --> 06:33:08,240
The carnival stream happened.

2702
06:33:08,240 --> 06:33:11,500
I had to pick something to focus on.

2703
06:33:12,619 --> 06:33:14,580
And I thought that that was more interesting to me

2704
06:33:14,580 --> 06:33:19,619
at the time.

2705
06:33:19,619 --> 06:33:21,650
What happened to your book?

2706
06:33:21,650 --> 06:33:22,970
You know, I've gone over what happened to my book

2707
06:33:22,970 --> 06:33:26,189
like probably a thousand times.

2708
06:33:26,189 --> 06:33:28,349
I ripped it in half, I put it in a shredder.

2709
06:33:28,349 --> 06:33:35,799
I wrote like 17 pages.

2710
06:33:35,799 --> 06:33:39,319
I copy and pasted just random parts of the book

2711
06:33:39,319 --> 06:33:45,319
into the chat like two years ago.

2712
06:33:46,240 --> 06:33:49,490
I wasn't cut out for it.

2713
06:33:49,490 --> 06:33:58,810
I'm not cut out for it.

2714
06:33:58,810 --> 06:33:59,650
I'm writing a thesis.

2715
06:33:59,650 --> 06:34:00,970
I'm at 130 pages.

2716
06:34:00,970 --> 06:34:02,729
I couldn't even get to like 16.

2717
06:34:05,169 --> 06:34:06,729
But I also was making,

2718
06:34:06,729 --> 06:34:09,450
I was trying to like do way more elaborate stuff

2719
06:34:09,450 --> 06:34:12,700
with Choose Your Own Adventure stuff.

2720
06:34:12,700 --> 06:34:13,900
Writing a Choose Your Own Adventure book,

2721
06:34:13,900 --> 06:34:18,919
you have to write like 15 books.

2722
06:34:18,919 --> 06:34:24,189
That's the amount of data that's inside of one of these.

2723
06:34:24,189 --> 06:34:25,349
And I got overwhelmed and I was like,

2724
06:34:25,349 --> 06:34:32,259
this is probably not gonna work.

2725
06:34:32,259 --> 06:34:36,919
I wish I could.

2726
06:34:36,919 --> 06:34:39,360
But that is what happened to the music stream

2727
06:34:39,360 --> 06:34:44,069
that got eaten both financially

2728
06:34:44,069 --> 06:34:49,069
and kind of mentally by the carnival stream.

2729
06:34:50,700 --> 06:34:54,779
All things off stream that I would be potentially working on

2730
06:34:54,779 --> 06:35:00,849
is carnival stream until the 22nd of September essentially.

2731
06:35:00,849 --> 06:35:05,840
And then I'll be kind of wanting to do something else.

2732
06:35:05,840 --> 06:35:12,540
But hope that answers your question.

2733
06:35:12,540 --> 06:35:16,310
Thank you Nukable for the $10.

2734
06:35:16,310 --> 06:35:17,830
Hey Jerem, long time viewer, first time donator.

2735
06:35:17,830 --> 06:35:20,029
I've been watching since your TF2 days.

2736
06:35:20,029 --> 06:35:29,029
Jerma Hart, PS, please play Metal Gear Solid 3.

2737
06:35:29,029 --> 06:35:31,159
That's a great game.

2738
06:35:31,159 --> 06:35:32,479
In fact, I would probably put it up there

2739
06:35:32,479 --> 06:35:36,229
with in the top two, I think.

2740
06:35:36,229 --> 06:35:40,799
I think that's probably one of the best ones.

2741
06:35:40,799 --> 06:35:46,369
May even be the best one.

2742
06:35:46,369 --> 06:35:49,639
But thank you Nukable for the 10 bucks.

2743
06:35:49,639 --> 06:35:53,040
Glad you stuck around.

2744
06:35:53,040 --> 06:36:01,369
But I have no immediate plans to play any Metal Gear stuff.

2745
06:36:01,369 --> 06:36:04,049
But thank you.

2746
06:36:04,049 --> 06:36:06,450
Thank you Blue Crew for the $5.

2747
06:36:06,450 --> 06:36:08,330
Hi Jerma, I just turned 22 today.

2748
06:36:09,169 --> 06:36:11,409
Happy birthday, first of all.

2749
06:36:11,409 --> 06:36:12,689
And I want to share the celebration

2750
06:36:12,689 --> 06:36:14,689
with one of my favorite people on the internet.

2751
06:36:14,689 --> 06:36:17,209
Been watching since your grandpa Call of Duty videos

2752
06:36:17,209 --> 06:36:19,450
and you've helped me through some tough times.

2753
06:36:19,450 --> 06:36:21,009
Was wondering if you'd be interested in streaming

2754
06:36:21,009 --> 06:36:23,369
one of my favorite games, Lisa.

2755
06:36:23,369 --> 06:36:25,529
Cool Earthbound inspired indie game.

2756
06:36:25,529 --> 06:36:27,009
Anyways, thanks for everything, man.

2757
06:36:27,009 --> 06:36:31,000
Thank you for the $5.

2758
06:36:31,000 --> 06:36:33,080
I have actually touched upon Lisa before.

2759
06:36:33,080 --> 06:36:35,479
I have said I'm not going to play it on stream.

2760
06:36:37,150 --> 06:36:39,709
Unfortunately, I will not be playing Lisa on stream.

2761
06:36:49,319 --> 06:36:50,840
Play Celeste.

2762
06:36:50,840 --> 06:36:51,680
I did play Celeste.

2763
06:36:51,680 --> 06:36:54,000
I beat Celeste on stream.

2764
06:36:54,000 --> 06:36:54,840
That wasn't that long ago.

2765
06:36:54,840 --> 06:36:58,970
That was only like, what, four or five months ago?

2766
06:36:58,970 --> 06:37:00,290
I've done that.

2767
06:37:00,290 --> 06:37:04,599
It was fun.

2768
06:37:04,599 --> 06:37:05,959
It was a really good game.

2769
06:37:09,509 --> 06:37:12,790
But happy birthday.

2770
06:37:12,790 --> 06:37:14,680
Happy 22nd birthday.

2771
06:37:14,680 --> 06:37:15,919
Have a good one.

2772
06:37:15,919 --> 06:37:16,880
Eat cake if you like it.

2773
06:37:16,880 --> 06:37:20,919
If you don't like cake, substitute that for ice cream.

2774
06:37:20,919 --> 06:37:22,849
That's what I do.

2775
06:37:23,689 --> 06:37:24,529
Who wants cake?

2776
06:37:24,529 --> 06:37:25,369
We got cake here.

2777
06:37:25,369 --> 06:37:27,569
And I'm like, can I, can I just ice cream?

2778
06:37:27,569 --> 06:37:30,409
And you get that fucking squinting stare.

2779
06:37:30,409 --> 06:37:31,409
Like, really?

2780
06:37:33,360 --> 06:37:35,319
No, that's okay.

2781
06:37:35,319 --> 06:37:42,860
Thank you.

2782
06:37:42,860 --> 06:37:43,700
Thank you though.

2783
06:37:43,700 --> 06:37:50,799
Happy birthday.

2784
06:37:50,799 --> 06:37:53,500
Thank you Apple shit for the 250.

2785
06:37:53,500 --> 06:37:55,180
Hey man, do you listen to Taylor Swift?

2786
06:37:55,180 --> 06:37:56,540
She's my fave.

2787
06:37:56,540 --> 06:37:58,099
And she just put out a new album.

2788
06:37:58,099 --> 06:37:59,900
So I've got to ask, have a great day.

2789
06:38:04,000 --> 06:38:07,799
Let me try to come up with one song from Taylor Swift

2790
06:38:07,799 --> 06:38:12,459
that I could reliably say is Taylor Swift's song.

2791
06:38:12,459 --> 06:38:13,299
Let me try it.

2792
06:38:13,299 --> 06:38:16,880
Hold on.

2793
06:38:17,720 --> 06:38:21,060
She wears sneaker.

2794
06:38:21,060 --> 06:38:23,580
I wear sneakers.

2795
06:38:23,580 --> 06:38:25,459
I'm in the bleachers.

2796
06:38:27,000 --> 06:38:28,200
Right?

2797
06:38:28,200 --> 06:38:33,819
Is that one?

2798
06:38:33,819 --> 06:38:39,200
That's Taylor Swift, right?

2799
06:38:39,200 --> 06:38:41,200
I don't know the name of that song.

2800
06:38:41,200 --> 06:38:47,200
All I know is that that is Taylor Swift singing that song.

2801
06:38:47,200 --> 06:38:54,909
And you, and you, and you belong with me.

2802
06:38:55,110 --> 06:38:57,099
Eee.

2803
06:38:57,099 --> 06:38:58,380
I had to just decide if I was going to be able

2804
06:38:58,380 --> 06:39:14,240
to hit her or not and I could.

2805
06:39:14,240 --> 06:39:16,520
I don't, I'm glad you like Taylor Swift.

2806
06:39:16,520 --> 06:39:20,490
That's the only song I've ever heard on the radio.

2807
06:39:20,490 --> 06:39:21,450
I don't even listen to the radio.

2808
06:39:21,450 --> 06:39:23,529
Guys, I silently sit in the car.

2809
06:39:23,529 --> 06:39:26,479
Does anybody else do that?

2810
06:39:26,479 --> 06:39:27,959
I don't listen to music or anything.

2811
06:39:27,959 --> 06:39:31,040
I just sit there quietly in the car and just drive.

2812
06:39:36,959 --> 06:39:41,200
Does that make me a psycho?

2813
06:39:41,200 --> 06:39:46,639
But I need to be, no, I can't.

2814
06:39:46,639 --> 06:39:48,919
It's the sounds of the road and the tires

2815
06:39:48,919 --> 06:39:58,340
and the vibrating of the dashboard and stuff.

2816
06:39:58,340 --> 06:40:01,860
Guys, I make my own and I talk to myself in the car.

2817
06:40:01,860 --> 06:40:03,860
How would I ever be able to play music

2818
06:40:03,860 --> 06:40:06,419
when I'm having incredibly detailed conversations

2819
06:40:06,419 --> 06:40:21,319
out loud with myself?

2820
06:40:21,319 --> 06:40:22,479
He's Patrick Bateman.

2821
06:40:22,479 --> 06:40:26,229
No, no, people, everybody does that.

2822
06:40:26,229 --> 06:40:28,909
You even pull up at a red light and you look over

2823
06:40:28,909 --> 06:40:31,229
at the car next to you and this,

2824
06:40:31,229 --> 06:40:33,909
and somebody is just talking away.

2825
06:40:33,909 --> 06:40:36,470
Just their mouth is moving up and down and all kinds of,

2826
06:40:36,470 --> 06:40:38,229
they're like really distinctively,

2827
06:40:38,229 --> 06:40:40,310
and there's nobody in the car.

2828
06:40:40,310 --> 06:40:41,549
And then you understand there's no music,

2829
06:40:41,549 --> 06:40:44,669
so they're not lip syncing or singing along with anything.

2830
06:40:44,669 --> 06:40:48,049
And they don't, there's no call.

2831
06:40:48,049 --> 06:40:48,889
They're not on the phone.

2832
06:40:48,889 --> 06:40:53,459
No, they're not.

2833
06:40:53,459 --> 06:40:55,020
They're not on a cell phone.

2834
06:40:55,020 --> 06:40:55,860
No, they're not.

2835
06:40:55,860 --> 06:40:56,700
They're looking straight,

2836
06:40:56,700 --> 06:40:58,380
they don't have their hands are both on the wheel.

2837
06:40:58,380 --> 06:41:01,950
No, no audio coming out of that car.

2838
06:41:01,950 --> 06:41:17,310
No hands-free phone.

2839
06:41:17,310 --> 06:41:24,000
Why are you staring at this person?

2840
06:41:24,200 --> 06:41:32,919
It's free phone calls.

2841
06:41:32,919 --> 06:41:33,759
Well, good.

2842
06:41:33,759 --> 06:41:34,959
I'm glad you all think that.

2843
06:41:34,959 --> 06:41:37,439
I'm glad that's all what you guys have in your brain

2844
06:41:37,439 --> 06:41:39,040
whenever you see anybody doing that.

2845
06:41:39,040 --> 06:41:41,279
Because when you pull up next to me,

2846
06:41:41,279 --> 06:41:42,840
I'm not on the phone,

2847
06:41:43,680 --> 06:41:45,599
but that means everybody thinks I am.

2848
06:41:45,599 --> 06:41:46,680
So that's good.

2849
06:41:46,680 --> 06:41:47,500
I'm glad.

2850
06:41:47,500 --> 06:41:49,040
That makes me really happy in knowing that people

2851
06:41:49,040 --> 06:41:50,959
will just be like, oh, that guy's on the telephone.

2852
06:41:50,959 --> 06:42:12,919
No, I'm not.

2853
06:42:12,919 --> 06:42:14,400
You don't do it while walking down the street.

2854
06:42:14,400 --> 06:42:16,040
No, because the car,

2855
06:42:16,040 --> 06:42:21,500
an automobile is a completely enclosed space.

2856
06:42:21,500 --> 06:42:23,020
It's like, it's almost like your own,

2857
06:42:23,020 --> 06:42:24,540
it's like being in the bathroom.

2858
06:42:24,540 --> 06:42:27,259
It's like your own personal little bathroom space.

2859
06:42:27,259 --> 06:42:28,099
Nobody's there.

2860
06:42:28,099 --> 06:42:29,860
If you're, if it's nobody in there,

2861
06:42:29,860 --> 06:42:32,779
you can, you can talk, you can just relax.

2862
06:42:32,779 --> 06:42:35,060
You drive, you obviously pay attention to the road,

2863
06:42:35,060 --> 06:42:38,619
but it's like your own little space.

2864
06:42:38,619 --> 06:42:43,299
You're enclosed.

2865
06:42:43,299 --> 06:42:55,279
No, you don't go to the bathroom in your car.

2866
06:42:55,279 --> 06:42:58,680
It's the only place where you can truly scream.

2867
06:42:58,680 --> 06:43:00,560
This person gets it.

2868
06:43:00,599 --> 06:43:03,540
You get it.

2869
06:43:03,540 --> 06:43:10,240
In the car is the only place where you can scream.

2870
06:43:10,240 --> 06:43:15,330
You can be like, woohoo!

2871
06:43:15,330 --> 06:43:16,290
And it's just, it's fine.

2872
06:43:16,290 --> 06:43:18,040
It's just you.

2873
06:43:18,040 --> 06:43:33,000
If I do that here, I'm gonna wake somebody up.

2874
06:43:33,000 --> 06:43:34,200
Just do that on your Twitch streams.

2875
06:43:34,200 --> 06:43:35,639
You do that in the bathroom.

2876
06:43:39,450 --> 06:43:45,369
No, I don't do that in the bathroom.

2877
06:43:45,369 --> 06:43:47,610
The car is the safest place to make weird noises.

2878
06:43:47,610 --> 06:43:49,509
Yeah, you can just be in the car and be like,

2879
06:43:49,509 --> 06:43:53,650
boop, boop, boop, boop, ooo, ho, ho, ho, ho.

2880
06:43:53,650 --> 06:43:56,090
Ain't anybody ever gonna fucking know you did that.

2881
06:43:56,090 --> 06:43:56,970
I just did that right now.

2882
06:43:56,970 --> 06:44:02,959
I bet you Kim heard what I just did.

2883
06:44:02,959 --> 06:44:04,439
She's, I mean, after the stream's over,

2884
06:44:04,439 --> 06:44:05,279
she's probably gonna come up and be like,

2885
06:44:05,279 --> 06:44:07,840
why'd you make those weird noises?

2886
06:44:07,840 --> 06:44:28,509
And I'm gonna be like, god, wish I was in my fucking car.

2887
06:44:28,509 --> 06:44:36,099
What kind of car does Jeremy Albertson drive?

2888
06:44:36,099 --> 06:44:36,939
We already went over this.

2889
06:44:36,939 --> 06:44:41,189
You guys are gonna have to guess.

2890
06:44:41,189 --> 06:44:44,069
You'll never get it.

2891
06:44:44,069 --> 06:44:49,770
It's so cool.

2892
06:44:49,770 --> 06:44:52,569
No, it's not a 2009.

2893
06:44:52,569 --> 06:44:53,569
Yeah, it is.

2894
06:44:53,569 --> 06:44:56,119
Did I talk about this already?

2895
06:44:56,119 --> 06:44:56,959
Did you guys already get it?

2896
06:44:56,959 --> 06:44:57,779
Did I already?

2897
06:44:57,779 --> 06:44:59,520
Oh, yeah, you guys already got it, nevermind.

2898
06:44:59,520 --> 06:45:05,040
The mystery is solved.

2899
06:45:05,040 --> 06:45:07,709
Nevermind.

2900
06:45:07,709 --> 06:45:10,790
But, enough of that, we'll move on.

2901
06:45:10,790 --> 06:45:13,659
Thank you to Gnarly for the 250.

2902
06:45:13,659 --> 06:45:15,139
Today I learned that some of the voices

2903
06:45:15,139 --> 06:45:16,959
from Undertale characters are sampled sound clips

2904
06:45:16,959 --> 06:45:17,860
from other media.

2905
06:45:19,909 --> 06:45:22,430
Flowey's voices are from Ronald McDonald

2906
06:45:22,430 --> 06:45:30,479
and Sans is Patrick from Sponged Bob.

2907
06:45:30,479 --> 06:45:35,400
Hold on, wait, Flowey's voice is Ronald McDonald?

2908
06:45:35,400 --> 06:45:49,080
What clip of Ronald McDonald sounds like that?

2909
06:45:49,080 --> 06:45:49,919
That's insane.

2910
06:45:57,479 --> 06:45:59,040
Flowey.

2911
06:45:59,880 --> 06:46:01,630
That game was really fun.

2912
06:46:01,630 --> 06:46:03,830
That game was really just interesting to play.

2913
06:46:11,400 --> 06:46:14,479
Hold on, I wanna listen to this.

2914
06:46:14,479 --> 06:46:15,880
Sans voice is sample of Patrick going,

2915
06:46:15,880 --> 06:46:17,720
maybe it's the way you're dressed,

2916
06:46:17,720 --> 06:46:19,680
but the A part is trimmed out and looped.

2917
06:46:22,090 --> 06:46:31,669
Oh shit, huh?

2918
06:46:31,669 --> 06:46:48,500
The way you're dressed, maybe it, maybe, maybe, maybe.

2919
06:46:48,500 --> 06:46:58,950
Wow, interesting, that's cool.

2920
06:46:58,950 --> 06:47:00,509
That's, yeah, that's cool.

2921
06:47:00,509 --> 06:47:01,950
Did they have the Flowey one?

2922
06:47:01,950 --> 06:47:14,159
What's the Ronald McDonald one?

2923
06:47:14,159 --> 06:47:19,509
If anyone's got that one, I'm interested in that one too.

2924
06:47:19,509 --> 06:47:24,009
This one.

2925
06:47:24,049 --> 06:47:30,340
If this is a gnome, this stream's a gnome.

2926
06:47:30,340 --> 06:47:31,180
Just make sure where I go,

2927
06:47:31,180 --> 06:47:33,099
so you're, maybe you're aware of that.

2928
06:47:44,569 --> 06:47:46,450
So you guys really, really, really

2929
06:47:46,450 --> 06:47:48,689
are having a good time here.

2930
06:47:48,689 --> 06:47:51,409
There's a Rick Roll link and there's a gnome link.

2931
06:47:57,000 --> 06:47:59,360
Thanks, thanks to this person that saved the stream.

2932
06:47:59,360 --> 06:48:16,779
I'm here.

2933
06:48:16,779 --> 06:48:23,909
It packs the right, let's see.

2934
06:48:23,909 --> 06:48:43,740
And try shake.

2935
06:48:43,740 --> 06:48:47,580
What in the name of, what the fuck?

2936
06:48:47,580 --> 06:48:48,619
Make good use of that.

2937
06:48:48,619 --> 06:48:49,939
Ah, here they are.

2938
06:48:50,020 --> 06:48:54,500
Triple thick McDonald shakes.

2939
06:48:54,500 --> 06:48:55,619
Well, they're empty.

2940
06:48:58,849 --> 06:49:02,049
You sure can get a lot in these bags, can't you?

2941
06:49:04,049 --> 06:49:05,810
You always make good use of that.

2942
06:49:05,810 --> 06:49:06,810
Ah, here they are.

2943
06:49:07,770 --> 06:49:16,270
Oh.

2944
06:49:16,270 --> 06:49:19,340
Damn.

2945
06:49:20,900 --> 06:49:21,740
Oh.

2946
06:49:24,500 --> 06:49:28,080
I did that last stream.

2947
06:49:28,080 --> 06:49:31,729
It's pretty weird.

2948
06:49:31,729 --> 06:49:34,130
But thank you to Gunther.

2949
06:49:34,130 --> 06:49:35,729
Thank you Gunther Riddle for the 250.

2950
06:49:35,729 --> 06:49:38,049
What is Yardovich's favorite flavor of gum?

2951
06:49:40,060 --> 06:49:42,939
Blueberry, I don't know.

2952
06:49:42,939 --> 06:49:46,900
Thank you though.

2953
06:49:46,900 --> 06:49:51,180
Thank you Gnarly for the 250.

2954
06:49:51,180 --> 06:49:53,740
These RPG streams are fun.

2955
06:49:53,740 --> 06:49:54,740
Hope you do more in the future.

2956
06:49:54,740 --> 06:49:56,340
Preferably Bowser's Inside Story.

2957
06:49:56,340 --> 06:49:58,220
But I think we're driven,

2958
06:49:58,220 --> 06:50:00,740
we've driven that point home already.

2959
06:50:03,200 --> 06:50:09,229
I guess that is the one that everybody likes the most, huh?

2960
06:50:09,229 --> 06:50:12,419
But thank you Gnarly.

2961
06:50:12,419 --> 06:50:15,220
I thank you Gunther for the 250

2962
06:50:15,220 --> 06:50:17,819
and it's the second part of the

2963
06:50:17,819 --> 06:50:22,029
what is Yardovich's favorite flavor of gum?

2964
06:50:22,189 --> 06:50:25,069
And the answer is Spear?

2965
06:50:25,069 --> 06:50:26,790
Spearmint?

2966
06:50:26,790 --> 06:50:27,630
Spearmint.

2967
06:50:30,529 --> 06:50:33,840
Because of the spear?

2968
06:50:33,840 --> 06:50:34,840
That's pretty good.

2969
06:50:50,779 --> 06:50:55,259
Thank you BitSlave for the five dollars.

2970
06:50:55,259 --> 06:50:56,659
Hey Jeremy, a few streams ago I told you about

2971
06:50:56,659 --> 06:50:58,700
how I was stuck in the base, in this base.

2972
06:50:58,700 --> 06:51:00,020
You said you hoped I got orders soon

2973
06:51:00,020 --> 06:51:04,349
and the very next day I was given orders

2974
06:51:04,349 --> 06:51:06,909
to out process.

2975
06:51:06,909 --> 06:51:09,029
I'll be attending Survival Evasion,

2976
06:51:09,029 --> 06:51:16,810
Resistance, and Escape training.

2977
06:51:16,810 --> 06:51:18,689
Well, I'm glad you got actual orders

2978
06:51:18,689 --> 06:51:20,409
but you were talking about that.

2979
06:51:20,409 --> 06:51:27,979
So I wonder how intensive that is.

2980
06:51:27,979 --> 06:51:29,459
Survival Evasion, Resistance, Escape.

2981
06:51:29,459 --> 06:51:33,349
Well, good luck with it, whatever it is.

2982
06:51:33,349 --> 06:51:34,189
And then they say,

2983
06:51:34,189 --> 06:51:36,349
by the way, will you please play League of Legends?

2984
06:51:36,349 --> 06:51:42,310
No.

2985
06:51:42,310 --> 06:51:44,750
Somebody could knock on this back door here

2986
06:51:44,750 --> 06:51:47,430
with like a briefcase full of like 50 grand in it.

2987
06:51:48,349 --> 06:51:52,060
And all I had to do was play League of Legends

2988
06:51:52,060 --> 06:51:54,299
and understand the whole game

2989
06:51:54,299 --> 06:51:57,599
and understand all the champions

2990
06:51:57,639 --> 06:52:01,599
and play at a level that I was at least competent

2991
06:52:01,599 --> 06:52:04,689
in knowing how to do everything.

2992
06:52:04,689 --> 06:52:07,419
I would slowly close the door

2993
06:52:07,419 --> 06:52:09,180
and come back and sit up.

2994
06:52:09,180 --> 06:52:11,180
I wouldn't do it.

2995
06:52:11,180 --> 06:52:12,939
That would take me, you know,

2996
06:52:12,939 --> 06:52:14,900
if I had to put in like a hundred hours

2997
06:52:14,900 --> 06:52:18,040
to like know everything about every champion,

2998
06:52:18,040 --> 06:52:19,400
I wouldn't do it.

2999
06:52:19,400 --> 06:52:21,360
I wouldn't do that for fucking 50 grand.

3000
06:52:31,860 --> 06:52:34,659
That sounds like, that sounds really, really,

3001
06:52:34,659 --> 06:52:36,500
really like entitled.

3002
06:52:37,259 --> 06:52:45,919
I wouldn't play a game for 50 grand.

3003
06:52:45,919 --> 06:52:48,200
I have no interest at all.

3004
06:52:48,200 --> 06:52:49,720
But I don't know, here's another thing though.

3005
06:52:49,720 --> 06:52:53,220
I have no interest in like farming either.

3006
06:52:53,220 --> 06:52:54,060
If somebody was like,

3007
06:52:54,060 --> 06:52:55,139
hey, I'll give you 50 grand

3008
06:52:55,139 --> 06:52:58,659
if you'd learn how to plant all these carrots

3009
06:52:58,659 --> 06:53:00,459
and corn and shit and like learn to milk cows

3010
06:53:00,459 --> 06:53:01,299
and run my farm.

3011
06:53:01,299 --> 06:53:03,180
I'm gonna be like, dude, I don't wanna do that.

3012
06:53:03,180 --> 06:53:04,020
I don't even know, I don't know,

3013
06:53:04,020 --> 06:53:12,069
where am I gonna start?

3014
06:53:12,069 --> 06:53:16,069
It would take as long to learn

3015
06:53:16,069 --> 06:53:18,549
every recommended perfect meta build

3016
06:53:18,549 --> 06:53:20,189
for every champion.

3017
06:53:20,189 --> 06:53:21,069
It would take the same amount of time

3018
06:53:21,069 --> 06:53:29,619
to learn how to run a farm.

3019
06:53:29,619 --> 06:53:30,459
That would be, that would be,

3020
06:53:30,459 --> 06:53:31,740
I could probably learn how to run a farm

3021
06:53:31,740 --> 06:53:39,299
in three to 500 hours.

3022
06:53:39,299 --> 06:53:41,459
I could probably learn how to,

3023
06:53:41,459 --> 06:53:45,060
I could, you know, think about like class.

3024
06:53:45,060 --> 06:53:47,580
If somebody would teach me how to plant every crop,

3025
06:53:47,580 --> 06:53:49,099
it would probably be about 500 hours

3026
06:53:49,099 --> 06:53:54,540
of me knowing how to do it.

3027
06:53:54,540 --> 06:53:55,740
Would I be any good at it?

3028
06:53:55,740 --> 06:53:59,700
No, still takes an extensive amount of knowledge

3029
06:53:59,700 --> 06:54:05,340
and skill to be able to run a farm.

3030
06:54:05,340 --> 06:54:12,060
It takes, you know, become an outdoor IRL farmer.

3031
06:54:12,060 --> 06:54:15,619
I don't think I'm good.

3032
06:54:15,619 --> 06:54:24,110
Every crop.

3033
06:54:24,110 --> 06:54:25,869
Farming is way more useful.

3034
06:54:25,869 --> 06:54:27,069
You know what, now that I think about it,

3035
06:54:27,069 --> 06:54:28,790
I would take that,

3036
06:54:28,790 --> 06:54:30,830
I would take 50 grand to go be a farmer

3037
06:54:30,830 --> 06:54:35,659
because that's, yeah, that is incredibly useful.

3038
06:54:35,659 --> 06:54:37,740
I would tell the guy trying to offer me 50 grand

3039
06:54:37,740 --> 06:54:38,560
to play League of Legends,

3040
06:54:38,560 --> 06:54:39,900
I'd be like, can you just go make a farm?

3041
06:54:39,900 --> 06:54:43,110
Pay somebody to make a farm.

3042
06:54:43,110 --> 06:54:56,349
Go grow some almonds somewhere.

3043
06:54:56,349 --> 06:54:58,270
What is the cutoff for the magazine submissions?

3044
06:54:58,270 --> 06:54:59,990
And okay, so let me, I gotta go over this.

3045
06:54:59,990 --> 06:55:03,169
This is very, actually really important.

3046
06:55:03,169 --> 06:55:08,369
There is no cutoff yet.

3047
06:55:08,369 --> 06:55:11,250
There is no cutoff for those submissions at the moment

3048
06:55:11,250 --> 06:55:13,450
because I need to place that somewhere.

3049
06:55:13,450 --> 06:55:16,209
So there is not a cutoff yet that's not tomorrow.

3050
06:55:17,939 --> 06:55:19,080
Because remember I told you last week

3051
06:55:19,080 --> 06:55:20,040
that I was gonna have to move it again

3052
06:55:20,040 --> 06:55:22,060
because of all this other stuff.

3053
06:55:22,060 --> 06:55:26,849
So that is not accurate.

3054
06:55:26,849 --> 06:55:30,970
We're just gonna keep those submissions open for now

3055
06:55:30,970 --> 06:55:39,000
until I can get a real date.

3056
06:55:39,040 --> 06:55:41,040
Somebody said, wait, when is this?

3057
06:55:41,040 --> 06:55:43,279
We don't have a date yet.

3058
06:55:43,279 --> 06:55:44,599
It was going to be,

3059
06:55:44,599 --> 06:55:47,080
the submissions deadline is gonna be tomorrow,

3060
06:55:47,080 --> 06:55:49,279
but it's just gonna be open for a little bit.

3061
06:55:49,279 --> 06:55:50,900
So take your time.

3062
06:55:50,900 --> 06:55:52,919
It's not gonna be closing on like tomorrow

3063
06:55:52,919 --> 06:55:54,599
or the next day or something.

3064
06:55:54,599 --> 06:55:56,560
This, it'll probably end up closing at some point

3065
06:55:56,560 --> 06:55:58,680
like next week and we'll do it like the week after.

3066
06:55:58,680 --> 06:56:02,349
It's gonna happen before the carnival stream,

3067
06:56:02,349 --> 06:56:07,080
but I kind of haven't been able to focus on it.

3068
06:56:07,080 --> 06:56:07,919
What am I talking about?

3069
06:56:07,919 --> 06:56:10,939
I'm talking about the activity book stream.

3070
06:56:10,939 --> 06:56:11,900
In the discord right now,

3071
06:56:11,900 --> 06:56:16,040
there are a series of channels under activity book,

3072
06:56:16,040 --> 06:56:21,040
dot to dot, where's Waldo, brain teasers, jokes and the like.

3073
06:56:25,560 --> 06:56:28,919
What you can do is you can go there

3074
06:56:28,919 --> 06:56:33,919
and submit a community themed image

3075
06:56:34,880 --> 06:56:38,490
in one of those categories.

3076
06:56:38,490 --> 06:56:46,919
I'm gonna compile a bunch of them to have about,

3077
06:56:47,880 --> 06:56:51,279
five to 10, maybe 10 plus dot to dots,

3078
06:56:51,279 --> 06:56:53,279
where's Waldo images and we're going to do

3079
06:56:53,279 --> 06:56:55,959
a community themed activity book on stream.

3080
06:56:55,959 --> 06:56:57,259
I'm gonna do it on stream.

3081
06:56:58,200 --> 06:57:00,279
There'll be coloring book pages

3082
06:57:00,279 --> 06:57:01,119
that are gonna be in there.

3083
06:57:01,119 --> 06:57:07,959
It's just gonna be a neat little thing that we're gonna do.

3084
06:57:07,959 --> 06:57:10,759
How am I gonna be picking the ones to use on the stream?

3085
06:57:10,759 --> 06:57:14,869
We are going to just kind of pick by our discretion.

3086
06:57:14,869 --> 06:57:17,630
So we're gonna try to find the ones that are,

3087
06:57:17,669 --> 06:57:21,069
obviously they could, let's say we do 10 to 20 dot to dots

3088
06:57:21,069 --> 06:57:24,189
or like 10 to 20, where's Waldo images

3089
06:57:24,189 --> 06:57:25,509
and where's Waldo by the way, if you don't know,

3090
06:57:25,509 --> 06:57:29,189
it's where you have an incredibly detailed potential image

3091
06:57:29,189 --> 06:57:31,790
where you have to hide me in it and I have to find it.

3092
06:57:36,990 --> 06:57:38,709
So that's still up in the air.

3093
06:57:38,709 --> 06:57:40,669
Just if you're working on something for it,

3094
06:57:40,669 --> 06:57:42,389
if you wanna have something for it,

3095
06:57:42,389 --> 06:57:45,430
I will have a real actual hard day here soon.

3096
06:57:45,430 --> 06:57:51,750
I just have not been able to put any real time into it.

3097
06:57:51,750 --> 06:57:56,040
He does scream in the car.

3098
06:57:56,880 --> 06:57:58,080
Yeah, like this one time we were going out

3099
06:57:58,080 --> 06:58:01,389
and I was so excited.

3100
06:58:01,389 --> 06:58:03,229
We got to a red light and I waited for the summer

3101
06:58:03,229 --> 06:58:05,029
to pull up next to me and I was like,

3102
06:58:05,029 --> 06:58:14,240
Yabba Dabba Doo, he's screaming in the bathroom.

3103
06:58:15,610 --> 06:58:18,250
I do not scream in the bathroom, okay?

3104
06:58:22,099 --> 06:58:30,900
Unless it's a Yabba Dabba Doo scenario.

3105
06:58:30,900 --> 06:58:35,080
Anyway, we're gonna move on.

3106
06:58:35,080 --> 06:58:40,529
Thank you to BBBBBBB Bird for the five dollars.

3107
06:58:40,529 --> 06:58:42,290
Hey German, much love from Australia.

3108
06:58:42,330 --> 06:58:44,490
Unfortunately, the Sans voice is,

3109
06:58:47,349 --> 06:58:50,680
right, thanks for the five dollars, appreciate it.

3110
06:58:54,290 --> 06:59:00,979
Yabba Dabba Doo scenario equals pee pants moment.

3111
06:59:00,979 --> 06:59:11,290
Lots of pee pants moments.

3112
06:59:11,290 --> 06:59:12,330
You've been live for seven hours.

3113
06:59:12,330 --> 06:59:14,770
You should have consumed six gallons of water by now.

3114
06:59:14,770 --> 06:59:15,610
Did you do it?

3115
06:59:26,439 --> 06:59:30,049
Hey, Demons V, thanks for the three bucks.

3116
06:59:30,049 --> 06:59:32,409
I like Mario RPG out of two.

3117
06:59:32,409 --> 06:59:34,409
I think they're very, very good games.

3118
06:59:34,409 --> 06:59:47,150
This one is a very good game, singular.

3119
06:59:47,150 --> 06:59:49,029
Just don't drink it from the Berkey.

3120
06:59:51,490 --> 06:59:53,970
That device is actually pretty good.

3121
06:59:53,970 --> 06:59:56,930
I really don't want to have to say this again.

3122
06:59:56,930 --> 07:00:01,369
It's not bad.

3123
07:00:01,369 --> 07:00:03,930
This next one is Noodle is bad at gaming for three dollars.

3124
07:00:03,930 --> 07:00:04,770
Thank you, Noodle.

3125
07:00:04,770 --> 07:00:06,049
And they say, I made a funny meme.

3126
07:00:06,049 --> 07:00:07,970
What do you mean you made a funny meme, what's that?

3127
07:00:18,000 --> 07:00:21,319
It's a me as Sans, do you eat ass?

3128
07:00:33,860 --> 07:00:36,099
It's a second long, just click it.

3129
07:01:00,229 --> 07:01:02,790
Show us how it would look if we saw you screaming in the car.

3130
07:01:02,790 --> 07:01:04,750
No, I'm not doing it.

3131
07:01:13,040 --> 07:01:14,680
Smelly boy, thanks to the 250.

3132
07:01:14,680 --> 07:01:16,680
Here, here, just the first minute,

3133
07:01:16,680 --> 07:01:17,639
you don't have to play this whole,

3134
07:01:17,639 --> 07:01:19,360
you don't have to play this on stream.

3135
07:01:19,360 --> 07:01:20,840
This is the best Trump impression I've ever heard.

3136
07:01:20,840 --> 07:01:26,930
I really can't stand your Stephen Colbert Trump.

3137
07:01:26,930 --> 07:01:29,270
My Trump is not Stephen Colbert Trump.

3138
07:01:29,270 --> 07:01:30,470
His boy better than that.

3139
07:01:37,349 --> 07:01:38,950
Trying to make some middle of the tiny.

3140
07:01:38,950 --> 07:01:40,990
He says, he says, hey, it's me, Donald.

3141
07:01:40,990 --> 07:01:48,709
I'm just trying to listen and let me tell you something.

3142
07:01:48,709 --> 07:01:53,450
I was, I was trying to find.

3143
07:01:53,450 --> 07:01:54,330
That, that's the same.

3144
07:01:54,689 --> 07:02:00,360
I heard the same thing.

3145
07:02:00,360 --> 07:02:01,520
In fact, I said it at the same time

3146
07:02:01,520 --> 07:02:10,810
and it was in both of my ears and I heard the same voice.

3147
07:02:10,810 --> 07:02:18,439
I don't know what you're talking about.

3148
07:02:18,439 --> 07:02:19,599
Hey, been loving Mario RPG,

3149
07:02:19,599 --> 07:02:21,279
you should play more comfy games like this.

3150
07:02:21,279 --> 07:02:31,560
I probably will.

3151
07:02:31,560 --> 07:02:36,479
No, Stephen Colbert, Stephen Colbert Trump is like this.

3152
07:02:36,479 --> 07:02:39,150
He goes like this.

3153
07:02:39,150 --> 07:02:44,150
It's me, Stephen Colbert doing the Stephen Colbert Trump.

3154
07:02:45,069 --> 07:02:53,229
I'm sorry, mine's a lot more nuanced than that.

3155
07:02:53,229 --> 07:02:56,029
My Trump is a little like this.

3156
07:02:56,029 --> 07:03:01,229
He said, I, hey, hold on.

3157
07:03:01,229 --> 07:03:04,330
Don't, I don't put my hands in the air

3158
07:03:04,330 --> 07:03:07,770
and wave them around like this.

3159
07:03:07,770 --> 07:03:09,090
Well, you can't see.

3160
07:03:14,740 --> 07:03:17,419
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3161
07:03:17,419 --> 07:03:41,119
Hold on, we're gonna put this to rest right now.

3162
07:03:41,119 --> 07:03:41,959
Oh, that's a good Trump.

3163
07:03:41,959 --> 07:03:44,900
That's a good Trump.

3164
07:03:44,900 --> 07:03:48,830
And his eyes are rolling back in his head.

3165
07:03:48,830 --> 07:03:50,930
What is it?

3166
07:03:50,930 --> 07:03:52,369
That's a good Trump.

3167
07:03:52,369 --> 07:03:54,400
That's not Trump.

3168
07:03:54,400 --> 07:04:00,900
Hold on.

3169
07:04:00,900 --> 07:04:08,090
If you think that's even close to what I did.

3170
07:04:08,090 --> 07:04:14,049
Get to the part with the rapping and the music.

3171
07:04:14,049 --> 07:04:15,810
Get to the part with the rap.

3172
07:04:15,810 --> 07:04:18,930
Get to the part with the rapping and the music, okay?

3173
07:04:18,930 --> 07:04:22,360
I don't have time to do this.

3174
07:04:22,360 --> 07:04:25,750
I can't believe this thing won a Tony.

3175
07:04:25,750 --> 07:04:27,349
I can't believe this thing won a Tony.

3176
07:04:27,349 --> 07:04:29,830
No, I can't believe this thing won a Tony.

3177
07:04:29,830 --> 07:04:43,740
That's unbelievable, not even close.

3178
07:04:43,740 --> 07:04:46,580
Your Stephen Colbert doing a Trump impression

3179
07:04:46,580 --> 07:04:49,459
is better than the actual impression.

3180
07:04:59,139 --> 07:05:00,939
No, it's not.

3181
07:05:00,939 --> 07:05:01,779
No way.

3182
07:05:06,930 --> 07:05:08,729
My fucking ego.

3183
07:05:08,729 --> 07:05:11,330
Shit, that was 20 damage.

3184
07:05:11,330 --> 07:05:23,250
It's all right.

3185
07:05:23,250 --> 07:05:28,979
God damn it.

3186
07:05:28,979 --> 07:05:30,939
Let me tell you, believe me.

3187
07:05:35,409 --> 07:05:37,409
Hey, I never claimed to be an impressionist.

3188
07:05:37,409 --> 07:05:39,169
I just claimed to be incredibly gifted

3189
07:05:39,169 --> 07:05:41,709
at doing other people's voices.

3190
07:05:41,709 --> 07:05:53,090
Oh, fuck.

3191
07:05:53,090 --> 07:05:54,049
Have I seen the tongs?

3192
07:05:54,049 --> 07:05:54,889
I don't know what the tongs are.

3193
07:05:54,889 --> 07:05:55,930
That's a good question.

3194
07:05:55,930 --> 07:06:00,430
I will come down and help you look in a minute.

3195
07:06:00,590 --> 07:06:03,029
If I liked your lich also gave an insane amount of subs,

3196
07:06:03,029 --> 07:06:05,759
let's go ahead and put them on screen.

3197
07:06:05,759 --> 07:06:10,979
Cause I mean, it was 49 gifted subs.

3198
07:06:10,979 --> 07:06:12,020
They're gonna fly by.

3199
07:06:12,020 --> 07:06:13,500
Here they are.

3200
07:06:13,500 --> 07:06:24,169
Thank you everybody for the subs.

3201
07:06:24,169 --> 07:06:28,049
Thanks for new subs, old subs, community subs.

3202
07:06:28,049 --> 07:06:31,490
If you stuck with this channel for the last four years

3203
07:06:31,490 --> 07:06:34,770
or if you just found the channel literally last night.

3204
07:06:34,770 --> 07:06:40,250
Thank you.

3205
07:06:40,250 --> 07:06:42,639
Have a great next couple of days.

3206
07:06:42,639 --> 07:06:49,959
See you guys on Thursday.

3207
07:06:49,959 --> 07:06:52,950
We have two more bits to go through.

3208
07:06:52,950 --> 07:06:53,790
Much love to all of you.

3209
07:06:53,790 --> 07:06:56,720
Thank you.

3210
07:06:56,720 --> 07:06:59,889
Gondor Lane, thanks for the 250.

3211
07:06:59,889 --> 07:07:01,849
Have you heard of Limbo of the Lost?

3212
07:07:01,849 --> 07:07:03,290
It's a really horrible point and click

3213
07:07:03,290 --> 07:07:07,049
that's infamous for using stolen assets from a dozen games.

3214
07:07:07,049 --> 07:07:09,290
Yet it has its charm of being so bad, it's good.

3215
07:07:09,290 --> 07:07:12,880
It's free to download because it's also been abandoned,

3216
07:07:12,880 --> 07:07:14,720
but it still has the reputation of the worst point

3217
07:07:14,720 --> 07:07:16,680
and click game that has ever existed.

3218
07:07:16,680 --> 07:07:18,400
Please play it.

3219
07:07:18,400 --> 07:07:19,959
You'll do us all a good favor.

3220
07:07:25,319 --> 07:07:27,310
Maybe.

3221
07:07:27,310 --> 07:07:29,310
I do wanna do another FMV night

3222
07:07:29,310 --> 07:07:31,349
because there's at least a handful of FMV games

3223
07:07:31,349 --> 07:07:38,000
that I have not played that I would like to play.

3224
07:07:38,000 --> 07:07:40,919
So you will absolutely see me play a bunch of FMV games,

3225
07:07:40,919 --> 07:07:48,610
although I don't know if that's also an FMV game.

3226
07:07:48,610 --> 07:07:54,319
I do wanna play Ripper.

3227
07:07:54,319 --> 07:07:57,799
That should be fun.

3228
07:07:57,799 --> 07:08:03,159
Also at the very end, thank you to Flugboy for the $5.

3229
07:08:03,159 --> 07:08:04,000
Hey, hope you're doing well.

3230
07:08:04,000 --> 07:08:07,909
Jeremy was waiting to ask you, wanted to ask you something.

3231
07:08:07,909 --> 07:08:10,069
Now I know you like newer shit like the Gorillaz,

3232
07:08:10,069 --> 07:08:11,549
but you like any old school music

3233
07:08:11,549 --> 07:08:13,909
like The Beatles, Deep Purple Prince, et cetera.

3234
07:08:22,159 --> 07:08:25,139
Yeah, I do.

3235
07:08:25,139 --> 07:08:30,799
But I kinda just, I don't have any Beatles albums,

3236
07:08:30,799 --> 07:08:33,040
but if The Beatles are on the radio,

3237
07:08:33,040 --> 07:08:38,040
when I'm not fucking talking and doing a monologue in the car,

3238
07:08:38,599 --> 07:08:41,360
if The Beatles are on somewhere, I'll point up and go,

3239
07:08:41,360 --> 07:08:44,200
oh, The Beatles are on here.

3240
07:08:44,200 --> 07:08:50,630
Guys, I get most of my music media consumption

3241
07:08:50,630 --> 07:08:53,729
from the inside of a grocery store

3242
07:08:54,909 --> 07:08:58,000
or whatever is playing in the mall.

3243
07:08:58,000 --> 07:08:59,880
And if you're walking around

3244
07:08:59,880 --> 07:09:01,639
and you're buying some jeans at Old Navy

3245
07:09:01,639 --> 07:09:08,389
and you hear like fucking Prince on the radio,

3246
07:09:08,830 --> 07:09:12,430
you look up and you go, oh, all right, Prince, nice.

3247
07:09:13,970 --> 07:09:18,990
And then I go back to buying jeans.

3248
07:09:18,990 --> 07:09:20,909
But I mean, I like music,

3249
07:09:20,909 --> 07:09:32,490
I just don't really listen to a lot of music.

3250
07:09:32,490 --> 07:09:35,770
Jeremy is confirmed an NPC.

3251
07:09:35,770 --> 07:09:38,689
I'm not an, what do you mean NPC?

3252
07:09:38,729 --> 07:09:46,819
I'm a playable character, all right?

3253
07:09:46,819 --> 07:09:50,340
What do you mean, what does that mean, true?

3254
07:09:50,340 --> 07:09:52,799
True, he's an NPC.

3255
07:09:52,799 --> 07:09:54,279
Why, because I walk around the mall

3256
07:09:54,279 --> 07:09:56,919
and go into Old Navy and buy jeans

3257
07:09:56,919 --> 07:09:59,479
because I don't listen to The Beatles?

3258
07:09:59,479 --> 07:10:03,919
That makes me like a non-playable character?

3259
07:10:03,919 --> 07:10:04,919
Guess what, guys?

3260
07:10:04,919 --> 07:10:08,919
When I play GTA, I turn the damn radio off.

3261
07:10:08,919 --> 07:10:12,479
I'm driving around as like Franklin in that car

3262
07:10:12,479 --> 07:10:15,799
or as Jared, what's his name?

3263
07:10:15,799 --> 07:10:29,770
The other guy, Michael, and I turn it off.

3264
07:10:29,770 --> 07:10:31,430
What's his name?

3265
07:10:31,430 --> 07:10:43,880
Trevor, Trevor, did I say Jared?

3266
07:10:43,880 --> 07:10:45,279
And that might be because I don't wanna get

3267
07:10:45,279 --> 07:10:47,599
my channel copyright striked,

3268
07:10:47,599 --> 07:10:49,560
but it's also because I'm the playable character

3269
07:10:49,560 --> 07:11:03,709
and I don't wanna hear it.

3270
07:11:03,709 --> 07:11:06,790
But no, I do not really listen to that much music.

3271
07:11:06,790 --> 07:11:08,430
I listen to it when it's available,

3272
07:11:08,430 --> 07:11:13,479
but I don't listen to it kind of on purpose.

3273
07:11:13,479 --> 07:11:16,200
I'll be like in a club or a bar,

3274
07:11:16,919 --> 07:11:18,599
that's the lie, this doesn't happen.

3275
07:11:18,599 --> 07:11:23,900
It only happens when for some, I don't go to clubs.

3276
07:11:23,900 --> 07:11:29,490
But if I was there, I would hear the music in the club.

3277
07:11:29,490 --> 07:11:31,049
I can't even tell, I don't even remember

3278
07:11:31,049 --> 07:11:34,560
the last time I walked into a club.

3279
07:11:34,560 --> 07:11:38,840
It has to have been when I was like, I don't know, like 22?

3280
07:11:38,840 --> 07:11:40,919
I have not walked inside of a club

3281
07:11:40,919 --> 07:11:44,000
in probably 10 fucking years.

3282
07:11:44,000 --> 07:11:48,529
I don't even know what they play in clubs anymore.

3283
07:11:48,529 --> 07:11:51,950
The guy with the marshmallow head, right?

3284
07:11:51,990 --> 07:11:55,200
And they play Fortnite music.

3285
07:11:55,200 --> 07:12:07,970
That's what I heard.

3286
07:12:07,970 --> 07:12:09,169
All right, I'm leaving.

3287
07:12:12,950 --> 07:12:14,630
I'm actually seething.

3288
07:12:14,630 --> 07:12:18,130
I'm kidding, it's a joke.

3289
07:12:18,130 --> 07:12:20,009
I'll see you guys on Thursday.

3290
07:12:20,009 --> 07:12:22,290
Bye, good night, goodbye.

3291
07:12:22,290 --> 07:12:23,849
See you Thursday.

3292
07:12:23,849 --> 07:12:24,849
Take care of yourselves.

3293
07:12:24,849 --> 07:12:25,849
Have a good night.
