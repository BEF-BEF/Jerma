00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,580
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:19,379
Not exactly sure what's gonna be in the background. It could be Team Fortress 2, it could be anything really at all.

3
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:25,879
But I'm not gonna really talk about the gameplay. It's gonna be probably a fairly quick video, but I just wanted to make sure that I talked about this.

4
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:34,990
Because it's something I've been waiting for, for years. It's something I've been waiting for since I was probably 15 years old, and it's finally happening.

5
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:41,490
And I want to give it as much attention as I possibly can, and give you the backstory on it, and give you the reasons why.

6
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,299
And let's just get right into it here.

7
00:00:43,299 --> 00:00:52,799
A lot of you guys know I am a huge fan of The Neverhood, and of Doug Tenable, the guy that made Earthworm Jim. He's the original creator of Earthworm Jim.

8
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:59,799
I'm gonna put a couple links in the description here, and one of them is going to be of my Enlighten video on The Neverhood.

9
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:06,299
And it's a very, very good game. It's probably one of the best games I've ever played, in regards to style, in regards to storytelling.

10
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,299
And just, it's bleeding with style, we'll just say that.

11
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:17,299
So if you never had a chance to play it, it's hard to get. I mentioned this in the video, I think you can't really buy it anywhere.

12
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:22,299
You're gonna have to go find it somewhere online. But we'll step away from that.

13
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:26,040
The guy that made The Neverhood is making a new game.

14
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,030
The game is called Army Krog, and it has a Kickstarter right now.

15
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,030
That's gonna be in the description as well.

16
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:41,640
And the reason why I'm making this video is because this guy, Doug Tenable, this game, The Neverhood, and his new game even,

17
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:48,140
these are the reasons why I got into stuff like voice acting, why I got into film and TV and video production.

18
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,879
Seriously, all of this stuff is the direct result of Doug Tenable.

19
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:57,379
And if he's watching this video right now, Doug, you're a fantastic guy, I love all your work.

20
00:01:57,379 --> 00:02:01,879
And I want to try to support this project as much as I possibly can.

21
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:09,659
And to transition into this next part of the video, it's the things you love, you never lose sight of them.

22
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:15,159
We all have that thing that we really, really liked when we were younger, or that thing that somebody said,

23
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:19,969
or that somebody did an old friend, or an old thing, an old piece of work, that you never lose.

24
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:21,469
And I'll never lose it.

25
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:27,469
The scenes in The Neverhood and the stuff and some of the things that I've taken as a younger kid will never leave me.

26
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:32,879
This new project that he's working on is just bringing it all back.

27
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:39,379
And I really hope they get as much money as they possibly need to push this project as far as it can possibly go.

28
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:42,379
It's all gonna be in claymation, it's just gonna be just like The Neverhood.

29
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:46,879
I would even say it's a spiritual successor to The Neverhood.

30
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,379
The characters are very similar, the art style is very similar.

31
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:55,379
And I can't say enough about this game and how much I can't wait for it to be released.

32
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:58,379
I can't wait to see developments on this game.

33
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:01,879
And that's why I'm backing this game by $1,000.

34
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:05,379
I'm giving $1,000 to the Kickstarter of this game.

35
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:08,919
And I want to give more money than that.

36
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:17,099
If I had the funds, guys, if I was able to donate $5,000, $10,000 to this project, I would do it today.

37
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,599
And I just can't though.

38
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,599
And that's like the sad thing.

39
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:29,080
I wish I could do more because I'm just so heavily emotionally invested in this game at this point.

40
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,080
So if you liked what you saw when you clicked on the link in the description, there's gonna be a bunch of links there.

41
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,080
I heavily encourage you check them out.

42
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,080
If you liked it, spread this video around, tell your friends about the project.

43
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,080
Maybe back it by a couple dollars.

44
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,080
I mean, whatever you want to do.

45
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:50,580
And even if you don't, even if you have no interest in this project at all, that's cool too.

46
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,580
This is not me telling you, hey, you gotta go back this project now.

47
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,580
But as much as I would like to say that, it's just to try to get the word out there about it.

48
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:02,580
Because I'm such a huge fan of everything this guy produces.

49
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,580
And maybe it piqued your interest a little bit.

50
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,580
That's the goal with this video.

51
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,580
But with that, I'm probably gonna wrap it up here, guys.

52
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,080
Actually, I completely forgot about this.

53
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,080
I wanted to talk about this as well.

54
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,079
I passed 100,000 subscribers a few days ago.

55
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,319
And I love y'all.

56
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:21,319
You're all amazing.

57
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:23,319
I wish there was more I could say, but there's just not.

58
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:25,319
Everything that you guys have done is incredible.

59
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:27,319
You guys all rock.

60
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:32,319
And I'm going to be doing a very long stream probably this coming weekend.

61
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:34,319
So I want to get some time to prepare for it.

62
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:36,319
Probably gonna be streaming some of my old favorite games.

63
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:41,319
I'm gonna try to play through the entire game of Super Mario RPG.

64
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:43,319
That's probably what's gonna happen.

65
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:45,319
It's tentative to change.

66
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,319
But that will happen probably on Saturday.

67
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:49,319
I'm probably gonna start Saturday morning.

68
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:51,319
And go till Saturday night.

69
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:53,319
We'll see how that happens.

70
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:55,319
But I'll make another formal announcement.

71
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:57,319
Just keep a lookout on the Twitter and on the Facebook page.

72
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:59,319
God, I need to start updating my Facebook page.

73
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:01,319
But whatever.

74
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:03,319
We're gonna end the video here, guys.

75
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:05,319
Moral of the story is this.

76
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:07,819
When you love something, you love it.

77
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:09,819
And support it as much as you can.

78
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:11,819
Whether it's a person, a thing, it doesn't matter.

79
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:13,819
Verb or noun.

80
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:15,819
Make sure you love the things you love.

81
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:17,819
And make sure they know that you do.

82
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:19,819
So go give your mother a hug right now.

83
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,819
Mommy, come give me a hug.

84
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:23,819
No, you guys understand.

85
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:25,819
But again, that's gonna wrap it up.

86
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:27,819
I'll see you guys all next time.

87
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:29,819
Take care, everybody.
