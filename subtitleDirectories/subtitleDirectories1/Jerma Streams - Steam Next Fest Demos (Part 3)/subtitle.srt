1
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,969
Let me just very briefly go over this because a lot of people are going to be very unhappy.

2
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:30,390
I know I usually don't say anything for at least a minute or two, but I'm here right- I'm here immediately.

3
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,250
All right, have I even start saying this?

4
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:40,340
All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm very, very

5
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:44,899
not happy to announce that there will be no BLT eating on this stream.

6
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:47,450
Uh, I know what's up.

7
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,729
We have lettuce and tomato chunks.

8
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:03,909
I didn't go get any bacon or anything, and we have hot dog buns.

9
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:07,530
I was thinking about like, okay, can I like fake this?

10
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,450
Can I go- can I take a hot dog bun, just put mayo in it,

11
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,650
lettuce, and some tomato chunks, and let's pretend there's bacon in it,

12
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:17,209
and take a couple bites and be like, whoa, BLT!

13
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,769
But then people- you guys would tell me to prove I'm eating a BLT.

14
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:28,810
So I'd have to show it to the camera and really examine it to a point where there's no way

15
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,170
it's a BLT, so sorry about that.

16
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:37,239
Anyways, I'll eat a BLT like at some point.

17
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,040
Who cares?

18
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,840
I was laughing about this before starting because it's just like,

19
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:45,989
oh, hey, sorry guys, I'm not eating the BLT on stream today.

20
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:53,099
It's like, I- that's a- that's a sentence that is hard to understand as a real sentence.

21
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:56,140
You know what I mean?

22
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,980
More broken promises, it's alright.

23
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,420
Hey, speaking of broken promises, those of you- excuse me,

24
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,180
we're playing Sorcery today.

25
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,719
Sorcery is today.

26
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:19,939
So, broken promises, excuse me, didn't watch the Smurfs- the Smurfs movie, no.

27
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,710
No.

28
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,509
I've been pretty busy.

29
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,189
I haven't had- haven't had time to watch the Smurfs movie.

30
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,759
I'll watch the Smurfs movie.

31
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:36,330
No BLT is worse than no Sorcery.

32
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:38,520
What?

33
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,560
Yeah, sorry, I'm like 15 minutes late.

34
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,520
Well, I mean, it's gonna happen, whatever.

35
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,319
Stomach is being annoying.

36
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,930
Don't have to get into it, but it is.

37
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,300
As a new job, it is great.

38
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,360
I'm on a couple of projects right now.

39
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,560
You'll probably see them- I don't want to give you a time

40
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,759
because as it stood, when I joined the company,

41
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:05,819
they were kind of already in the middle of a few things

42
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,379
and I wasn't really a part of the process on them.

43
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,879
But later on, a lot of the stuff you'll see in the middle of this year

44
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:18,360
and into, you know, you know, the content plan into, you know,

45
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,550
next quarter or two, I'm on a couple of things

46
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,830
and I'm really, really excited for you to see them, especially one of them.

47
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:31,830
Oh, excitement, Andy.

48
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,150
You owe us 110 gifted subs.

49
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:43,830
Yeah, it's a lot- I'm happy- I'm really happy so far.

50
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,270
And I think I'm getting a pretty good idea of the workflow.

51
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,430
Because a couple weeks ago when this was announced,

52
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,430
it was almost like how- what's the strategy to do this?

53
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,310
So I can, you know, I want to stream still,

54
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,229
I want to do this still, I want to do writing,

55
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:59,830
I want to do, you know, get into meetings,

56
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,590
get into meetings, you know, executive meetings,

57
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,229
you know, executive meetings, you know, executive meetings,

58
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:08,710
you know, executive meetings, you know, executive meetings,

59
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,189
you know, executive meetings, you know, executive meetings

60
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:11,830
and all that stuff.

61
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:16,550
Are you all right?

62
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,709
I just sat down weird.

63
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:28,439
I sat down weird and kind of did my voice get weird,

64
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:29,720
kind of sounded a little weird for a second.

65
00:04:35,769 --> 00:04:36,810
Executive Andy.

66
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,449
Now, I think I've got a good idea of how it's going to work.

67
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:44,569
Yeah, I like it a lot.

68
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:46,889
It's real- I think I'm contributing.

69
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,480
You know, my role in the company,

70
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,040
and contrary to some of the popular belief here,

71
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,319
is not to just show up at the office

72
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:02,839
and see how far I can slide down the hallway with socks on.

73
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:06,519
And that's- everyone just kind of looks out their office

74
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:07,480
and be like, oh, what's he doing?

75
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,199
Okay.

76
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,160
Chief Creative Officer.

77
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:11,610
So, you know.

78
00:05:17,589 --> 00:05:17,990
All right.

79
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,310
Today, we're going to play Steam NextVest Games.

80
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:23,620
I was supposed to do this a long time ago,

81
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,430
but I'm glad it's back.

82
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,350
And then Sorcery.

83
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,189
So I downloaded a bunch of these games already.

84
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,740
Because last time I did this, I kind of scrolled

85
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,220
and then installed and had to install them live.

86
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:42,870
And I just got like 15 to 16 of them

87
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,550
that looked interesting to me.

88
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,379
And we're just going to go.

89
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:50,360
It's on the docket.

90
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,360
That's a good question.

91
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,920
First, I'm just going to pick a random one.

92
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,750
Because I don't want to say what I have.

93
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,230
And then people say, no, no, no, dude, just play that only.

94
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:11,129
So let's do- I mean, how long is the Lies of P demo?

95
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:12,490
Because I want to play it.

96
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,129
I just want to see.

97
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,129
Is it long or should I-

98
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,180
We've got to give it like 10 to 20 minutes to each of these.

99
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:19,980
It's like 30 minutes.

100
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:21,740
Like three hours.

101
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:23,110
No way.

102
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:25,740
Like 20 minutes.

103
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,750
Five hours?

104
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:30,149
What?

105
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:30,389
All right.

106
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:31,509
Well, let me just check it out.

107
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:33,670
We're going to jump around every 10, 20 minutes or so.

108
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,110
I just want to get a taste.

109
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,759
So let's do it now.

110
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:39,000
Okay.

111
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,379
Yeah, we'll do this for a couple of hours.

112
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:42,100
Maybe two, three hours.

113
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,459
And then we'll move to sorcery.

114
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:44,420
Going to be chill today.

115
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:46,339
No cam.

116
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,939
So okay.

117
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:49,220
Everybody that's annoyed about that.

118
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:49,459
Sorry.

119
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,790
Shaders are compiling, really.

120
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,850
Do you lick your fingers after eating Doritos?

121
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:04,089
No.

122
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,990
Well, hold on.

123
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,990
Let me tell the truth.

124
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:12,629
Anytime I eat something like Takis or Doritos or Cheetos,

125
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:13,350
doesn't matter what it is.

126
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:17,750
If it leaves a residue on your fingers is what I do.

127
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:20,949
I go with the one single lick on the thumb.

128
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,689
Just one single lick.

129
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,129
And then I wash my hands.

130
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:32,250
All right.

131
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:32,569
Let me-

132
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:38,199
You guys can't see this, but now you can.

133
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,569
And you hear it though is a better question.

134
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:43,050
Now you can.

135
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:44,230
All right.

136
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,029
I got a controller.

137
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:46,149
So it's a controller game, right?

138
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:50,939
Do up to the first boss.

139
00:07:51,829 --> 00:07:52,790
Let's see.

140
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:55,910
Because I don't want to spend like three hours in one demo.

141
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:57,319
Check it out.

142
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:59,240
The next best demos.

143
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,199
I'm going to play Lies of P for four hours

144
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,720
and then not even play sorcery.

145
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:07,290
This is my word.

146
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:07,850
Is it right here?

147
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:11,899
Warning.

148
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:16,490
This icon will appear when the game is saving.

149
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,129
Yeah.

150
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,689
The functions and text in the demo version of Lies of P that you-

151
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:23,620
How's the audio?

152
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,339
Should I turn it up?

153
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:28,019
Or it could be a little louder.

154
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:33,529
And use a license agreement.

155
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:34,330
Oh, shit.

156
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:35,929
I got to agree to this.

157
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:43,940
Let's go.

158
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:52,120
Is it loud now?

159
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,840
You didn't read it?

160
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,120
I did.

161
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,269
You just couldn't see.

162
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,879
Now Lying.

163
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:00,840
This is a good game for me.

164
00:09:04,659 --> 00:09:07,700
In honor of the great writer, Carlo Colodi.

165
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,500
I can't actually.

166
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,860
I did not hear that if anybody talked.

167
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:23,129
Was I supposed to hear that?

168
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,210
I can't hear this.

169
00:09:26,409 --> 00:09:33,940
It's a lie?

170
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,659
No, it actually isn't.

171
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:35,700
I didn't hear any of that.

172
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,019
Why?

173
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:39,850
My audios.

174
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:40,490
Oh no, sorry.

175
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,210
I didn't have this plugged in.

176
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:42,899
All right, cool.

177
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,340
Move, rotate camera.

178
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:48,070
Now I can hear.

179
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:48,309
Good.

180
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:49,610
Liar.

181
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:54,700
Okay.

182
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,600
So what was this game?

183
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,840
What would you guys compare this to?

184
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,639
Does this game have like a certain comparison of a certain franchise?

185
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:05,159
Or a certain like style of games that I would potentially like?

186
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:10,470
Jiminy.

187
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,500
Okay.

188
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:19,399
Kind of looks like Tetris.

189
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:24,870
Jiminy, please escort him to the hotel.

190
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,269
This is Jiminy?

191
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:29,639
Do not be afraid.

192
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:33,000
Even if you get lost in the fog, the cricket guide will be with you.

193
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:41,659
Okay.

194
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:45,899
Okay, cool.

195
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:46,299
Vod.

196
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:46,940
Hi chat.

197
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,139
Hey, can we please get everybody take a quick second, please.

198
00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:51,580
And say hello to the Vod Watchers.

199
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,220
We don't.

200
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,950
I think they feel a little left out.

201
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:55,669
Don't you think so?

202
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,700
Everybody on the count of three say.

203
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,980
Hey, Vod Watchers.

204
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,779
Enjoy the show.

205
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,460
Hey, Vod Watchers.

206
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:07,899
Enjoy the show.

207
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,340
Now I'm going to put on a bunch of DMCA music so they can't hear anything for the rest of

208
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:16,409
the entire fucking stream.

209
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:17,929
I'm just kidding, Vod Watchers.

210
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:18,409
Stay here.

211
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:25,139
Can I move faster than this?

212
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:27,539
But the streets are not safe.

213
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,799
Arm yourself with one of the weapons over there.

214
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:35,720
Somebody said, is he, somebody said this a while ago, but they said, is he sober?

215
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,399
And it stuck with me because I was like, why did you say that?

216
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:44,440
Combat style.

217
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:47,509
Balance.

218
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:48,950
Dexterity.

219
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,679
Strength.

220
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:52,519
Path of the Cricket.

221
00:11:52,519 --> 00:12:00,379
The Bastard or the Sweeper.

222
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:05,750
Oh, it's going to, it's, I imagine it's going to be just like the other souls like games.

223
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,740
This doesn't really necessarily matter that much.

224
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:10,139
And this doesn't, it doesn't matter at all because it's a demo.

225
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:11,179
So I'm just going to go with this one.

226
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:23,830
All right.

227
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:24,309
Dodge roll.

228
00:12:24,309 --> 00:12:24,789
Feels good.

229
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,759
Okay.

230
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:27,480
Can you two hand?

231
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,549
Was a lawnmower inside of my ears.

232
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,860
Centrist Andy.

233
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:46,139
Rat central station.

234
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:46,700
Rainy night.

235
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:53,059
Special attack.

236
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:54,500
Hold down to do a charge attack.

237
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:54,659
Yeah.

238
00:12:56,259 --> 00:12:59,049
Okay.

239
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:01,769
It is a little, I'm going to turn it down.

240
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:02,570
It is a little loud.

241
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,899
You're going to die to the first enemy.

242
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,860
I play these games a lot.

243
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,940
I'm not going to die to the first enemy.

244
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:32,649
Uh, let's get it to like, uh, that's all right.

245
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:33,129
Is that better?

246
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:35,559
That's better.

247
00:13:38,169 --> 00:13:40,570
I am so glad I just turned it down right there.

248
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:57,500
The maximum number of pulse cells.

249
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,019
Use a pulse cell to recover HP.

250
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:03,580
There is a maximum number of times pulse cells can be used just like all the other games

251
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:06,299
that are in this category.

252
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:07,769
Okay.

253
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:09,610
If you attack enemies while the cell is discharged,

254
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,289
pulse cell will be gradually charged.

255
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:11,529
Okay.

256
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:13,220
So let's go.

257
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:24,519
We're checking out steam next best.

258
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:32,169
I'm not playing sorcery and I'm not playing another single other game today.

259
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:44,580
Because there's no way I'm going to get through this in 10 minutes.

260
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,860
It's already been 10 minutes.

261
00:14:46,500 --> 00:15:01,110
Light up your, who is that?

262
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:01,350
Okay.

263
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,029
That's, is that Jiminy talking?

264
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,029
I mean, it's not dark in here.

265
00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:09,929
Lies of Jay.

266
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:15,529
Yep.

267
00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:16,409
Okay.

268
00:15:16,409 --> 00:15:21,450
I feel like lies of P is going to be some really major consequences of the lies of P.

269
00:15:23,419 --> 00:15:27,740
Lies of Jay is like, I was going to eat a BLT today and I didn't.

270
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:29,159
Okay.

271
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:39,539
Like, whoa, what happened?

272
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:46,940
Bright bumper behind, right?

273
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:59,830
Oh, it has, there's an indicator.

274
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:00,309
Hold on.

275
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:08,059
Ah, lie.

276
00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:10,860
Like you said, you're going to play the great ace attorney Chronicles.

277
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,179
Sad.

278
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,289
Well, I didn't lie.

279
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,210
I just didn't do it.

280
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:24,600
Fable catalyst.

281
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:26,149
Okay.

282
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:27,830
Activate upper belt slot, lower belt slot.

283
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:28,950
I think I figured this out already.

284
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:29,269
I did.

285
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,860
That is lying.

286
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,570
Isn't there, okay.

287
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:37,210
But isn't there like intent when it comes to lying?

288
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:41,769
Like if I tell you, oh man, I really, really, I really, I want to go on that.

289
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:44,169
Uh, I want to go on that water slide.

290
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:47,399
Oh, I'm going to, you know, I'm going to try to go on that water slide on Thursday.

291
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,120
Okay.

292
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,320
If I don't go on the water slide on Thursday, isn't that just me expressing the thing that

293
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,799
I would like to do or thing I want to do?

294
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:59,129
Doesn't a lie technically have to have some kind of intent behind it?

295
00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:01,690
Like I am not telling you I'm going to go on the water slide.

296
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:04,089
So you like just to make it up.

297
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:07,140
Is that, don't you need to have like intent when it comes to lying?

298
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:15,769
It was like, oh man, I've, I love, I love water slides.

299
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:19,910
But then if I don't go to the water park, am I a liar?

300
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:24,039
Just me liking water slides no longer.

301
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:25,319
Am I not allowed to say that anymore?

302
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,099
False equivalency.

303
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:39,769
Okay.

304
00:17:39,769 --> 00:17:46,089
To me, to me, a lie of real live would be if somebody said, Hey dude, do you want to

305
00:17:46,089 --> 00:17:47,849
go to the water park today?

306
00:17:47,849 --> 00:17:54,390
And I said, no, no, I, uh, I'm getting nighted today.

307
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:55,509
Sorry.

308
00:17:56,539 --> 00:17:57,259
Oh, really?

309
00:17:57,259 --> 00:17:57,579
Yeah.

310
00:17:57,579 --> 00:17:59,400
I'm getting nighted today.

311
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,759
Oh, weird.

312
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:01,000
All right.

313
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,970
We'll hit us up next week.

314
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:05,930
That's like a lie.

315
00:18:07,339 --> 00:18:08,940
Is an actor a professional liar?

316
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:10,299
Interesting question.

317
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:20,809
Me, me expressing desires and things that I would like to do and want to do is not, I

318
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:21,849
mean, is that a lie?

319
00:18:21,849 --> 00:18:25,289
If you don't actually do the thing that you say you like to do or want to do.

320
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:26,890
Yeah.

321
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:30,250
I said, I want to go camping the fucking three years ago and I didn't go camping.

322
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,700
Is that a lie?

323
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,259
Or is it like, I just didn't fucking want to do, I just didn't want to go camping.

324
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:40,279
All right.

325
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:41,319
This is a harder enemy.

326
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:49,289
Okay.

327
00:18:49,289 --> 00:18:53,480
Just, I'm going to die to the first real enemy of the game.

328
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:55,289
Is there a parry?

329
00:18:56,009 --> 00:19:02,299
All right.

330
00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:04,059
This guy feels harder than everybody else.

331
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,099
Can I, I want to parry this guy.

332
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:13,859
He usually would be right here, but what does this do?

333
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:14,980
Left arm of steel.

334
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,460
What is that?

335
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,099
I'm dead.

336
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:24,740
I'm dead here.

337
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:32,539
Why does this guy have so much more health and shit?

338
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:32,779
Okay.

339
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:34,299
Every enemy has died in three hits.

340
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:37,259
This guy is like impossible.

341
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:44,279
Who the fuck is this guy in the tutorial that is unkillable?

342
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:53,509
Tap.

343
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:55,190
What does the left arm even do?

344
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:55,750
Oh, okay.

345
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,710
Thanks for telling me.

346
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,349
Video game.

347
00:19:58,329 --> 00:20:01,210
Guard against, defend against enemy attacks by guarding.

348
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,930
If your guard is successful, it will reduce the,

349
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,859
they wait for you to die before they tell you there's a block.

350
00:20:06,859 --> 00:20:09,740
It will reduce the damage, but will cause stamina

351
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,779
and the damage will be transferred to guard regain.

352
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,700
Okay.

353
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,140
Guard regain will be turned into HP recovery if you attack enemies.

354
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,819
Guard regain accumulates, but gradually reduces after a certain time has passed.

355
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,259
If your guard is successful.

356
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:26,339
Okay.

357
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:27,380
So it's just a block.

358
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,789
Is it, can, is it like a, all right, let's go.

359
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:38,140
Okay.

360
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,339
Well, whatever.

361
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:40,599
Just don't get hit.

362
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:50,309
Okay.

363
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:51,269
Sawtooth wheel.

364
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,490
We're at the 20 minute mark.

365
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,609
I think it's time to move to a new game.

366
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,940
Let me, let me beat this guy though.

367
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:19,339
This game's like two to three hours for the demo.

368
00:21:19,339 --> 00:21:19,839
Yeah.

369
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:22,809
Run a poll.

370
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:34,250
Um, we want a time extension poll.

371
00:21:35,049 --> 00:21:39,960
Let me get, let me get past this first enemy.

372
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:49,099
How do I, it was already on.

373
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:53,349
So it's, you have to go up and down and then scroll.

374
00:21:53,349 --> 00:21:53,990
Okay. I get it.

375
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,309
Let me at least get to the first area.

376
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:05,430
Like, let me beat this first guy.

377
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,619
They just lost a customer.

378
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,160
Wait, you mean for the game?

379
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,380
What?

380
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:28,329
Are you talking about me or are you talking about you saying that?

381
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:37,599
Yeah, I'm not, this is, this is fun.

382
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:38,799
No, I'm, I didn't say that.

383
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,650
They just lost a customer.

384
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:51,950
Press the button.

385
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,509
This is, that's a shortcut.

386
00:23:02,509 --> 00:23:03,789
I didn't even look over here.

387
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:04,349
God damn it.

388
00:23:06,349 --> 00:23:07,150
I was worried.

389
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,589
Right behind me was the shortcut.

390
00:23:08,589 --> 00:23:09,390
Really?

391
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:09,890
All right.

392
00:23:10,829 --> 00:23:12,480
All right, let's go.

393
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:35,180
Are you even supposed to kill this guy?

394
00:23:35,740 --> 00:24:02,809
Okay. I'm not, this has Sekiro like block parries?

395
00:24:03,529 --> 00:24:04,029
Like this?

396
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:17,930
I don't, was that person lying?

397
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:20,559
This enemy is groggy?

398
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,299
All right.

399
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:28,940
There's other systems in this game that I do not know exist.

400
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,859
Groggy?

401
00:24:30,859 --> 00:24:32,059
What does groggy mean?

402
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:33,019
Groggy Gary.

403
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:39,079
Okay. Well, that was pretty sloppy, but whatever.

404
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,180
That was a fun spin.

405
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,880
You know, it means stagger.

406
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:59,720
Did I actually even have to do that?

407
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:13,500
Okay. Well, I'm going back up here.

408
00:25:25,579 --> 00:25:28,640
Wait, did I get, did it pick anything up?

409
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,359
What did that guy have?

410
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,170
Did he have anything on him?

411
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:42,170
Should we extend the time for lies of P?

412
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,880
Oh, not extended, but hold on.

413
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,319
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

414
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:49,369
I'm, I'm not done with it yet.

415
00:25:49,369 --> 00:26:00,839
Sorry, I'm lying.

416
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:05,849
He's lying.

417
00:26:05,849 --> 00:26:18,170
Am I missing something or?

418
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:21,210
And okay, seems correct.

419
00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:28,380
Is this a case where I killed that guy,

420
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,619
looked at chat and missed the item that the guy dropped?

421
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:33,640
Is that, is that what happened?

422
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:43,049
Yes. Oh, okay.

423
00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:52,910
Good. Okay.

424
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:55,579
Crat.

425
00:26:59,069 --> 00:27:00,910
Crat central station, rainy night.

426
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,339
Prepare the stargazer.

427
00:27:07,549 --> 00:27:08,910
At least get to the first boss.

428
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,140
Yeah. I can't leave the demo without.

429
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,980
Don't worry. We got plenty of time.

430
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,140
I'm not in a time limit.

431
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:21,359
All right. So this is a bonfire clearly.

432
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,599
It runs really well, plays really well.

433
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:28,599
I'm into it.

434
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:42,519
The lies just keep adding up.

435
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:45,960
What did this person say?

436
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,599
This is kind of funny.

437
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:49,960
They said you are on a time limit, dude.

438
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,880
Like not, nobody lives forever or something.

439
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,720
Like this technically is a time limit.

440
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,279
Clever one.

441
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,400
This stargazer will make you stronger,

442
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:03,240
but the stargazer strength doesn't last forever.

443
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:03,799
It's true.

444
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:04,920
So be careful with it.

445
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,200
Yeah.

446
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,519
Hurry up and come to hotel Crat.

447
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:13,630
Okay. Level up.

448
00:28:17,259 --> 00:28:20,619
So this is HP guard regain.

449
00:28:20,619 --> 00:28:24,269
So it is like Sekiro with a guard system.

450
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:29,180
Just go all stamina capacity.

451
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,470
Motivity technique.

452
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:33,710
All right.

453
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,549
Which one of these is strength index?

454
00:28:36,269 --> 00:28:39,079
This one looks like strength index.

455
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:45,079
I'm just play this game forever.

456
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:48,200
Hey, we, you hate this game and we all know it.

457
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:48,759
Hey, listen.

458
00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:51,259
God damn it.

459
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,000
No, I, I'm doing health and I'm doing this.

460
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,519
Yeah. What's about this projection?

461
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:05,799
Okay. Perfect guard.

462
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:08,430
Right before getting hit.

463
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,789
So this, this is a parry, I'm assuming.

464
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:25,420
Is that good?

465
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,059
Did I do it?

466
00:29:26,619 --> 00:29:35,079
So what's the benefit of actually doing a perfect parry?

467
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:36,519
It doesn't seem to stagger them or anything.

468
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,000
They don't have their own bar like Sekiro.

469
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:47,180
Do you like this game?

470
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:53,930
I bet you at least 70% of people say yes.

471
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,809
It builds stagger and you take no damage.

472
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:06,200
What am I fighting right now?

473
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:06,839
Is this oil?

474
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:17,240
This oil.

475
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:24,250
All right.

476
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,210
Well, hold on a second here.

477
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:26,890
You've got me in two different directions.

478
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:29,369
People are saying this is like, kind of like Bloodborne.

479
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,769
But then people say in Sekiro, they play very differently.

480
00:30:31,769 --> 00:30:32,970
I'm a dodge Andy.

481
00:30:33,529 --> 00:30:35,769
Bloodborne was all about dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge.

482
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:37,849
Sekiro is parry, parry, parry, parry, parry.

483
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:38,410
Which one is it?

484
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:38,970
I don't know.

485
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:39,609
It's interesting.

486
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,380
I frame Andy.

487
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:54,140
It's a mix of the two.

488
00:30:55,769 --> 00:30:59,130
Okay. Well, now I'm, I'm a lot more interested now

489
00:30:59,849 --> 00:31:02,329
because Bloodborne is one of my favorite games of all time.

490
00:31:03,049 --> 00:31:05,210
And I despise Sekiro.

491
00:31:05,289 --> 00:31:08,650
So, I mean, this is going to be a very interesting game for me.

492
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,599
I don't despise Sekiro.

493
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:24,279
I just don't like it at all.

494
00:31:32,589 --> 00:31:34,430
Pratt times issue 183.

495
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:38,039
No, it would be perfect.

496
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:44,000
Is if I somehow get a mechanism to have like a fake nose.

497
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:47,710
I haven't even said it.

498
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:48,509
It makes me laugh.

499
00:31:48,509 --> 00:31:48,910
Whatever.

500
00:31:49,869 --> 00:31:52,509
Have a fake nose and just say a bunch of lies on stream

501
00:31:52,509 --> 00:31:54,109
and just keep growing every time.

502
00:31:55,069 --> 00:32:08,960
Nevermind, plus two.

503
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,400
Yeah, you got to give me a chance.

504
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:16,920
You can't just, some of you guys really jump to conclusions.

505
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,480
Jump the gun.

506
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:19,849
You got to wait for the whole thing.

507
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,839
Okay. Um, it's just you.

508
00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:35,420
Dim ergo fragment.

509
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:48,720
Will he switch before the horse race is over?

510
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:50,240
What a horse race.

511
00:32:51,039 --> 00:33:01,849
Is a horse race?

512
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:17,980
I like it.

513
00:33:19,309 --> 00:33:20,109
Fable arts.

514
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:24,670
Use blade fable arts while guarding use handle fable arts.

515
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:29,079
Weapons have distinct blades and handles that each have their own fable art.

516
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:32,920
Fable arts use a fable slots and fable, different fable arts

517
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,160
use a different fable number of slots.

518
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,160
Charge fable slots by attack.

519
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:37,480
All right.

520
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:43,950
So I just used all of it and the big scary enemies running down the hallway now.

521
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:57,839
That's not perfect.

522
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:59,339
I'm surprised.

523
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:08,989
All right.

524
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:10,269
Hold for a charge attack.

525
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:14,110
So if they get groggy, I can probably kill them pretty quickly like that.

526
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,559
Oh, you guys.

527
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,039
You picked the turtle.

528
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:23,639
The turtle will never be the horses.

529
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,000
The horses are much faster.

530
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,119
They have more muscular definition than the turtle.

531
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:37,280
There's no way the turtle will win.

532
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,829
Now watch.

533
00:34:42,829 --> 00:34:45,070
I'm going to sprint as fast as I can then run out of energy.

534
00:34:45,869 --> 00:35:01,530
So what does this one do?

535
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,929
Oh, does that make attack power more?

536
00:35:06,809 --> 00:35:07,929
That's what the rabbit said, German.

537
00:35:07,929 --> 00:35:22,860
Look what happened to him when he raced the turtle grinder.

538
00:35:24,059 --> 00:35:25,179
Use the what is it?

539
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,889
All right.

540
00:35:26,889 --> 00:35:27,210
Hold on.

541
00:35:27,769 --> 00:35:28,090
Wait, wait.

542
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:28,730
I don't want to die here.

543
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:39,960
This is actually just do use the grinder.

544
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,440
This thing.

545
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:46,360
Hold on a second.

546
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,679
Oh, you have to grind the weapon for durability.

547
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,360
Okay.

548
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,199
Did the turtle win?

549
00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:13,239
Oh, my goodness.

550
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:16,039
You know how horrible that's going to be when you fight a boss in this game?

551
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:21,000
It's a hard boss and the boss needs like three hits and you have to grind your weapon.

552
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:23,480
That's going to be so sad.

553
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,559
I know it's going to happen at least a half dozen times.

554
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:46,880
Hey, anything to make it so you can't just press B to dodge everything, right?

555
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:52,800
He hates democracy.

556
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,079
I'm almost done.

557
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:56,280
This was one of the big ones.

558
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,079
This was one of the big ones.

559
00:36:57,079 --> 00:36:58,039
I really wanted to try this.

560
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:03,340
This is very obviously like one of the big ones of the next best.

561
00:37:04,059 --> 00:37:14,000
This is a okay.

562
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,719
Cool.

563
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:20,190
Let me just get eyes on where this is because this is a shortcut.

564
00:37:22,269 --> 00:37:23,070
Let him vibe.

565
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:23,389
Damn it.

566
00:37:23,389 --> 00:37:24,110
Yeah, let me vibe.

567
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:24,750
I'm just vibing.

568
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:33,840
Let me get eyes on this because I okay.

569
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:49,820
I'm just trying to figure out how to where the shortcut actually is going to.

570
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:53,289
You don't know what vibe means.

571
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,239
Not really.

572
00:38:00,989 --> 00:38:01,949
I am going to do this though.

573
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,880
I'm imagining.

574
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,599
Yep.

575
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,039
These are definitely crunchies, right?

576
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:08,750
Yes, they are.

577
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:21,760
Technique.

578
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,400
Advance.

579
00:38:26,619 --> 00:38:32,059
It's just stamina and that's good.

580
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,980
I think this is dexterity.

581
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,619
This might be strength, although it's hard to tell.

582
00:38:39,579 --> 00:38:41,900
I think this is strength.

583
00:38:42,539 --> 00:38:45,869
All right.

584
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,030
I'm absolutely good.

585
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:48,670
I'm going to run.

586
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,349
I kind of forget where I'm going, but it's all right.

587
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:54,460
Where was it?

588
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:57,099
It was this way up here.

589
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,849
This way, right?

590
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:04,059
Oh, that was so completely wrong.

591
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:12,190
Where did I even come from?

592
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:16,159
Down here?

593
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,440
No, no, it was up this way.

594
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:25,320
The entire.

595
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:25,639
Okay.

596
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:30,539
I should just reset it this way, right?

597
00:39:31,179 --> 00:39:32,750
Okay.

598
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:33,630
Yeah, let me reset it.

599
00:39:34,269 --> 00:39:44,909
This is going to be a 24 hour stream at this rate, dude.

600
00:39:44,909 --> 00:39:45,469
It's not.

601
00:39:45,469 --> 00:39:46,349
It's going to be fine.

602
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:53,760
I need to get to the first boss of the demo.

603
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,659
There's going to be a boss that you beat.

604
00:39:59,659 --> 00:40:02,539
And then it says, thank you so much.

605
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,139
Next player.

606
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,730
Thank you for playing the demo.

607
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,619
Is this guy just trying to punch me in the face?

608
00:40:24,219 --> 00:40:24,539
Really?

609
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:29,119
This is the first boss.

610
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,159
First boss, first boss.

611
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:30,880
All right.

612
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,280
This really wants to teach me how to do this.

613
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:54,489
Okay.

614
00:40:54,489 --> 00:40:55,849
I think I'm understanding it.

615
00:40:56,489 --> 00:40:59,690
The red one is easier for me for some reason.

616
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:00,250
I don't know why.

617
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:04,429
All right.

618
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:07,309
Cool.

619
00:41:07,309 --> 00:41:08,349
Hello there.

620
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:09,949
Welcome to Krot, visitor.

621
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,159
Hi.

622
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:14,119
I didn't think there were any stalkers left to fight the puppets.

623
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,039
You didn't hear?

624
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:17,639
Figures.

625
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,679
The whole organization fell apart.

626
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,559
All that's left are wannabes and amateurs who think they can fight on their own.

627
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,039
R1, R1, R1, R1, can you?

628
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:37,920
You can't buy something.

629
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,239
Okay.

630
00:41:39,949 --> 00:41:40,829
Rowing cell.

631
00:41:42,699 --> 00:41:45,340
Electric blitz damage at the area of impact.

632
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,909
Electric blitz aggressive.

633
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:57,949
I mean, this is, these are different weapons and everything.

634
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:00,460
Cool.

635
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,420
Looks pretty cool.

636
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:06,159
But I'm in demo mode and I'm just trying to get to the end of the demo.

637
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,710
Philip, let's go.

638
00:42:12,349 --> 00:42:12,750
All right.

639
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:15,230
Now what happens if you have two turtles though?

640
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,590
Mods make it happen.

641
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:20,190
I want to, I want to race with two turtles.

642
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,420
Which one will win?

643
00:42:25,469 --> 00:42:25,710
All right.

644
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,110
Here we go.

645
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,510
Time to prove that I know how to play video games again.

646
00:42:29,309 --> 00:42:31,389
This might be loud, so be aware of that.

647
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:51,210
Jesus.

648
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:53,949
Okay.

649
00:42:57,690 --> 00:42:58,809
Parade master.

650
00:42:59,449 --> 00:43:17,900
Let's go.

651
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,960
Somebody learned how to play the game.

652
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,250
Everybody in chat is seething right now.

653
00:43:38,969 --> 00:43:49,440
Shit, that hurt.

654
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,079
Groggy attack.

655
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,610
Do the swing.

656
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:02,010
Swing.

657
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:02,650
Do the big swing.

658
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:03,530
How do I do the swing?

659
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:03,769
What?

660
00:44:04,329 --> 00:44:05,449
I thought it was Y.

661
00:44:05,449 --> 00:44:06,650
It's not Y?

662
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:07,449
I pressed Y.

663
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:11,769
What is that?

664
00:44:11,769 --> 00:44:12,409
Oh my God.

665
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:18,429
All right.

666
00:44:18,429 --> 00:44:20,030
Your moveset just got way weirder.

667
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:49,659
What the fuck?

668
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,539
I didn't block it.

669
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:04,059
What does L2 do?

670
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:10,010
I'm in trouble.

671
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:18,679
I don't even know what L2 does.

672
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:22,010
Advisor sidearm.

673
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:32,030
I swear to God, if it tells me what L2 does when I revive, I'm gonna be very upset.

674
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,480
You die in a boss battle.

675
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,320
Death ergo is created at the entrance.

676
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,960
That's actually really awesome.

677
00:45:53,019 --> 00:45:56,380
That's such an unbelievably good change for these games.

678
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:01,119
It's outside the boss door.

679
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,920
So if you don't feel like if you go in there and you lose a shitload of souls.

680
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:09,480
I'm going the wrong way.

681
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,599
I'm going the wrong way.

682
00:46:12,489 --> 00:46:14,329
Glad to see this is still a thing.

683
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,780
Oh my God.

684
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:19,579
What the fuck?

685
00:46:39,849 --> 00:46:40,969
What did they all even come from?

686
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:44,440
All right.

687
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:45,639
Here we go.

688
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:47,639
I'm going to go beat this demo boss.

689
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:49,719
Don't worry.

690
00:46:49,719 --> 00:46:52,039
I'm not just going to play one demo.

691
00:46:57,199 --> 00:46:57,519
Cool.

692
00:46:57,519 --> 00:46:58,239
Okay.

693
00:46:58,239 --> 00:46:59,920
That's actually really cool.

694
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:10,559
I really like the sort of quality of life differences.

695
00:47:13,949 --> 00:47:15,309
I don't have anything.

696
00:47:15,309 --> 00:47:15,869
Whatever.

697
00:47:15,869 --> 00:47:16,590
It's the demo.

698
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:17,309
I don't care.

699
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:29,519
This is going to hit an hour before we change.

700
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:30,159
That's all right.

701
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:30,880
I'll add time.

702
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:46,010
I have to beat the parade master.

703
00:47:46,730 --> 00:48:03,239
Ow.

704
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:09,199
I'm already.

705
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,199
I already fucked the whole thing up.

706
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:18,670
I did so much better on the first try.

707
00:48:19,469 --> 00:48:27,869
Oh, come on.

708
00:48:27,869 --> 00:48:28,190
Really?

709
00:48:30,969 --> 00:48:42,239
I already have all.

710
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:42,880
Dude, I got him.

711
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:46,619
I wish I could just hold like right bumper and just reset.

712
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:48,730
Just kill me.

713
00:48:49,369 --> 00:48:59,530
I got to retry.

714
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:06,840
This took me five tries.

715
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,360
I don't even count that one.

716
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:13,210
Why'd you give up?

717
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:16,860
Because I had zero heals and he's not even at 10% health.

718
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:20,250
If I get him down to 10% health and I lose,

719
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:22,090
that'd be very sad.

720
00:49:25,789 --> 00:49:27,070
Okay, throwing objects.

721
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:28,670
I want to know what LT does.

722
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:32,360
Like, what does this do?

723
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:34,650
It's like a super punch.

724
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,019
I don't know.

725
00:49:37,019 --> 00:49:41,340
Go read the guide.

726
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:42,920
Where's the guide?

727
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:48,719
How do I get to the guide?

728
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:54,489
You'll get different abilities later.

729
00:49:55,369 --> 00:49:57,039
It's a super punch right now.

730
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,900
I'm going to try this two more times.

731
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,420
And even if I lose, it doesn't matter.

732
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:04,780
I'm moving on to the next demo.

733
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:07,340
This was a cool, good first look at lies of P.

734
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:10,809
We're moving on after two more attempts.

735
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:21,480
Two times.

736
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,199
Don't lie.

737
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:31,369
Okay, let's go.

738
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:36,320
Okay, I have to dodge backwards, not to the left.

739
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,559
Because they hit me with that every time.

740
00:50:58,199 --> 00:51:07,039
I feel like I'm not even hurting this guy.

741
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:22,559
Oh, come on.

742
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:33,559
I will say, the second that I'm allowed to change weapons,

743
00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:34,599
I'm going to immediately.

744
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:58,960
All right, groggy.

745
00:51:58,960 --> 00:51:59,360
Let's go.

746
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:29,900
Whoa, what the fuck is he doing?

747
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,099
Oh, I didn't get the groggy.

748
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:44,780
Do it.

749
00:52:46,599 --> 00:52:47,099
Yes.

750
00:53:07,469 --> 00:53:16,219
Oh, God, that double crow hop is annoying.

751
00:53:32,139 --> 00:53:34,139
Whoa, I thought I dodged it.

752
00:53:34,139 --> 00:53:35,019
Oh, my God.

753
00:53:35,019 --> 00:53:35,659
He's going to kill me.

754
00:53:35,659 --> 00:53:36,059
No, he's not.

755
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:36,559
I'm fine.

756
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:17,820
Damn it.

757
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:25,739
This game is fucking hard.

758
00:54:25,739 --> 00:54:27,000
God damn it.

759
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,420
L plus Y is parry.

760
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:34,090
Huh?

761
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:35,130
All right, one more time.

762
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:35,630
That's it.

763
00:54:43,019 --> 00:54:44,460
I don't think that's a parry.

764
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:45,340
I think that's like a buff.

765
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:53,690
Does it say?

766
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:56,039
I don't think it says anything about it.

767
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:00,920
Over leveled.

768
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:03,320
What am I doing?

769
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,639
I've had a chance to level one time.

770
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:08,920
All right, time that person up for at least 10 minutes.

771
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:14,750
All right, last attempt before I move on.

772
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:17,309
I'm not sitting here for two hours playing lies of P.

773
00:55:17,309 --> 00:55:17,809
Okay.

774
00:55:18,429 --> 00:55:33,440
I got so close.

775
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,000
All right, I'm going to use patience and I'm going to go for it.

776
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:37,460
Let's go.

777
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:54,590
Need stamina.

778
00:55:55,389 --> 00:56:13,039
Oh, that wasn't a perfect.

779
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:38,079
I feel like you got to be really close to hit them.

780
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,150
I think it's just I don't like the weapon.

781
00:56:41,789 --> 00:57:06,250
He's still not, is he groggy anymore?

782
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:07,210
Oh, that's sad.

783
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:12,519
Horrible place to be.

784
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:54,429
I didn't dodge it.

785
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,599
My brain is conflicted playing this game.

786
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:10,079
I'm playing secure.

787
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:27,260
But then I'm like, no dodge on.

788
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:30,760
Oh, my God.

789
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:31,239
I'm dead.

790
00:58:31,239 --> 00:58:32,679
All right, we're playing next game.

791
00:58:32,679 --> 00:58:37,460
Let's kill me.

792
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:46,190
All right, last one.

793
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:46,590
One more.

794
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:47,230
That's it.

795
00:58:47,230 --> 00:59:02,650
So should I be going more secure or more blood born?

796
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:07,039
I feel like my brain is trying to say play secure.

797
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:10,000
And then in a different move is like play blood born instead.

798
00:59:15,199 --> 00:59:17,119
You should play it more secure.

799
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,000
More secure, secure.

800
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,219
OK, so I should be trying to parry everything.

801
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:25,980
Not like you like this.

802
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:40,489
OK, this is the one right here.

803
00:59:40,489 --> 00:59:40,989
Guaranteed.

804
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:43,199
Holy shit, that did a lot of damage.

805
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:54,360
He broke my sword.

806
01:00:59,659 --> 01:01:00,380
What the fuck?

807
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:03,929
Oh, my God, dude.

808
01:01:04,489 --> 01:01:06,170
He's got so many different moves.

809
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:25,900
What?

810
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:51,739
Let's go groggy Gary.

811
01:01:53,579 --> 01:01:54,619
All right, good.

812
01:01:54,619 --> 01:01:57,019
I beat the tutorial boss one of probably five.

813
01:01:57,739 --> 01:02:00,510
That's fun.

814
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:05,070
I like it.

815
01:02:05,070 --> 01:02:06,679
I think it's very fun.

816
01:02:09,719 --> 01:02:10,760
Dodge less.

817
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:11,239
Well, what?

818
01:02:11,239 --> 01:02:12,039
OK, that's what I mean.

819
01:02:12,039 --> 01:02:14,440
Like I was saying, my brain is trying to play secure.

820
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:18,360
But my brain is also like you need to dodge left every attack.

821
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:23,869
Now that it's like, OK, more more secure style.

822
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:26,750
Try to go for those perfect parries.

823
01:02:28,190 --> 01:02:28,829
Pretty sick.

824
01:02:29,389 --> 01:02:30,670
Dodge more, not less.

825
01:02:30,670 --> 01:02:31,070
Wait, what?

826
01:02:34,809 --> 01:02:35,449
Wrong info.

827
01:02:36,409 --> 01:02:37,050
All right, that's fun.

828
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:42,780
I just want to see what's up here.

829
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:48,969
And that's it.

830
01:02:48,969 --> 01:02:49,449
Next game.

831
01:02:49,449 --> 01:02:50,250
I know, I just want to see.

832
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:51,769
I just want to see what's over here.

833
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:58,460
Look, there's like a notice that I need to look at.

834
01:02:59,099 --> 01:03:02,239
All right, I'm going to sprint to the next boss.

835
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:06,780
My L2 does.

836
01:03:22,539 --> 01:03:24,460
All right, I don't know what I just did.

837
01:03:25,099 --> 01:03:33,980
They told me to be the lie.

838
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:35,019
I said I was a human.

839
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:35,659
That's a lie.

840
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:41,800
All right, OK, all right, all right.

841
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,960
I'm going to get like obsessed with this game.

842
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:44,280
I'm done.

843
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:49,289
We're going to move on to House Flipper 2.

844
01:03:50,010 --> 01:03:52,159
Perfect opportunity to change.

845
01:03:52,159 --> 01:03:59,150
Look, I'm into it.

846
01:03:59,150 --> 01:04:00,590
When does it come out?

847
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:05,550
Does it release soon?

848
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:06,750
Like September, right?

849
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:10,909
I'm into it.

850
01:04:10,909 --> 01:04:23,280
Let's just see what happens in this cutscene.

851
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:30,170
I know I've spent like 45 minutes playing this game, but don't worry.

852
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:30,730
We're going to be fine.

853
01:04:32,090 --> 01:04:36,079
We're going to play Sorcery.

854
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:36,639
We're going to play.

855
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:39,519
House Flipper 2.

856
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,360
That's prune.

857
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:46,400
I'll use my power.

858
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:50,909
You can't.

859
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:52,429
All right, goodbye.

860
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:54,760
That was a good one.

861
01:04:54,760 --> 01:05:00,480
All right, the next one we're going to do House Flipper 2.

862
01:05:05,559 --> 01:05:06,920
This looks really fun.

863
01:05:07,559 --> 01:05:15,440
Those of you that don't know, House Flipper is one of my number one games on stream.

864
01:05:18,139 --> 01:05:21,179
I have streamed House Flipper more than any other game, I think.

865
01:05:21,179 --> 01:05:24,300
Besides, maybe if you combine all the From Software games.

866
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:28,360
So let's give it a try.

867
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:37,260
And you should see it in one.

868
01:05:39,449 --> 01:05:44,400
So what did they add in House Flipper 2?

869
01:05:46,199 --> 01:05:50,170
I wonder how long the stream is going to be.

870
01:05:50,170 --> 01:06:06,650
I don't know, maybe like six hours.

871
01:06:06,650 --> 01:06:07,289
Oh, shit.

872
01:06:07,289 --> 01:06:09,050
Okay, my capture is messed up.

873
01:06:09,050 --> 01:06:09,690
Hold on.

874
01:06:09,690 --> 01:06:12,039
I need to go to the settings here.

875
01:06:16,119 --> 01:06:17,800
You can probably hear the music, though.

876
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:18,440
It's very nice.

877
01:06:19,469 --> 01:06:20,909
I didn't even tweet that I was streaming.

878
01:06:20,909 --> 01:06:21,309
Hold on.

879
01:06:24,889 --> 01:06:32,989
There we go.

880
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:33,630
Screen's black.

881
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:34,030
Yeah, I know.

882
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:40,940
I'm just getting this situated.

883
01:06:42,219 --> 01:06:42,619
I didn't.

884
01:06:42,619 --> 01:06:43,900
I got to tweet, man.

885
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:48,059
Okay, that's fine.

886
01:06:53,559 --> 01:06:54,360
Okay, let's go.

887
01:06:58,159 --> 01:06:58,559
Settings.

888
01:06:58,559 --> 01:06:59,039
Here we go.

889
01:07:00,119 --> 01:07:00,679
Graphics.

890
01:07:01,239 --> 01:07:11,400
Okay, you should be able to see it now.

891
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:14,349
Please yell at me if you can't.

892
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:17,199
Yeah, why does it look like that?

893
01:07:28,730 --> 01:07:29,929
Okay, does that work?

894
01:07:29,929 --> 01:07:34,679
Hey, there we go.

895
01:07:34,679 --> 01:07:35,320
All right.

896
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:36,880
I'm ready.

897
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,840
New game.

898
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:46,010
I hope there's cleaning.

899
01:07:46,010 --> 01:07:48,829
I hope there's mopping.

900
01:07:48,829 --> 01:07:50,349
I hope there's clean the windows.

901
01:07:50,349 --> 01:07:52,670
I have a wish list for House Flipper 2.

902
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:58,510
You're about to play the House Flipper 2 demo.

903
01:07:58,510 --> 01:08:03,230
Follow the quest list to transform a rundown shack into a beautiful house.

904
01:08:03,869 --> 01:08:06,940
When you're done, you can keep playing and add some personal touches to it.

905
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,119
Look up for books placed around the house.

906
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:10,639
They'll tell you how to use your tools.

907
01:08:10,639 --> 01:08:10,880
Okay.

908
01:08:11,519 --> 01:08:23,159
Is there a problem with the reception on the island?

909
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:24,600
I just tried to.

910
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:25,880
I have to leave a message then.

911
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:28,460
Oh, my dearest friend.

912
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:29,020
I buttoned them.

913
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:32,460
You may be wondering where you got here.

914
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:33,260
Don't worry.

915
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:34,619
I'm here to explain.

916
01:08:34,619 --> 01:08:37,899
You said you want to try your handed house flipping, right?

917
01:08:37,899 --> 01:08:41,020
I found a perfect house for you to work on.

918
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:41,979
You can throw now.

919
01:08:41,979 --> 01:08:43,420
And not to waste any time.

920
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:48,060
I took the liberty of organizing your transport and everything else.

921
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:49,420
You're welcome.

922
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:52,779
So there's nothing more to do but to get to work.

923
01:08:52,779 --> 01:08:53,579
Do your best.

924
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:57,100
I hope to turn a large profit selling this house.

925
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:59,819
Who wouldn't like to live in such a wonderful neighborhood?

926
01:08:59,819 --> 01:09:01,819
Take care and happy flipping.

927
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:03,659
Thanks.

928
01:09:04,619 --> 01:09:05,609
Get to work.

929
01:09:06,409 --> 01:09:09,229
Flipper tool collecting trash.

930
01:09:09,949 --> 01:09:12,170
What do I do with the trash?

931
01:09:12,810 --> 01:09:16,829
Flipper sense.

932
01:09:17,550 --> 01:09:19,770
Okay.

933
01:09:21,739 --> 01:09:22,140
Tasks.

934
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:24,560
Stains.

935
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:25,279
Trash.

936
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:25,840
Okay.

937
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:33,069
What do I do with it?

938
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:39,680
Open?

939
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:40,880
Wait, I can open the trash?

940
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:43,949
All right.

941
01:09:43,949 --> 01:09:46,829
So in the first game, it just disappears.

942
01:09:46,829 --> 01:09:49,149
Do I actually have to clean it up and move it?

943
01:09:49,789 --> 01:09:50,109
Let's see.

944
01:09:50,109 --> 01:09:50,670
What does it say?

945
01:09:53,609 --> 01:09:57,850
Paint sticks to a wall on its own, but you can't say the same for panels, wallpaper, or tiles.

946
01:09:57,850 --> 01:09:59,770
Lay down some surface glue first.

947
01:09:59,770 --> 01:10:04,439
Okay.

948
01:10:04,439 --> 01:10:06,520
Left mouse to apply glue anywhere you want.

949
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:07,800
Don't want to go over the line.

950
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:09,720
Set the area for your glue first.

951
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:10,760
Actually, let's go back.

952
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:12,039
There's a couple of books I didn't look at.

953
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:15,899
This feels like it's not.

954
01:10:15,899 --> 01:10:17,579
I got to make the FOV bigger.

955
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,000
I don't think I can do it.

956
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:30,880
It'll be in the...

957
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,239
It'll be in the full game, I imagine.

958
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:38,399
Okay.

959
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:44,380
Collect all the trash in your range with the most durable trash bags known to man.

960
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:45,979
Choose the collecting trash tool.

961
01:10:46,539 --> 01:10:48,859
Find some garbage and press left click.

962
01:10:48,859 --> 01:10:51,279
It's gone from the ground, but your job is far from over.

963
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,159
When the bag fills up, throw it in the bin.

964
01:10:55,789 --> 01:10:59,390
So they went more like viscera clean-up detail style,

965
01:11:00,439 --> 01:11:05,279
where I actually have to carry this around and put trash in it.

966
01:11:05,279 --> 01:11:06,079
But where's the bin?

967
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:08,039
Is this a bin?

968
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:18,779
Okay, I'm collecting trash right now.

969
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,510
Okay.

970
01:11:29,659 --> 01:11:31,689
Okay.

971
01:11:32,409 --> 01:11:41,479
How much can I carry?

972
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:53,880
Okay, that's way more involved than it used to be.

973
01:11:54,680 --> 01:12:03,520
Clean.

974
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:10,350
So are the leaves and stuff considered trash?

975
01:12:11,159 --> 01:12:24,170
I can't pick this up anymore, right?

976
01:12:24,170 --> 01:12:24,890
Yep.

977
01:12:24,890 --> 01:12:31,130
Okay, close the bag.

978
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:33,840
Toss it.

979
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:37,739
Ooh, is there a map?

980
01:12:37,739 --> 01:12:50,409
Before I do anything, do you know what I'm saying?

981
01:12:50,409 --> 01:12:53,130
Like I remember this from the first game and I'm not fucking around.

982
01:12:53,130 --> 01:13:03,130
How do I swing it?

983
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:14,800
Okay, I don't think I can swing.

984
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:22,539
Okay, we're good.

985
01:13:26,829 --> 01:13:27,069
Q?

986
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:29,310
I think Q just changes how hard you're going to swing at it.

987
01:13:29,310 --> 01:13:33,119
Isn't there usually a map too?

988
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:56,510
So how come this is not considered trash right here?

989
01:13:56,510 --> 01:13:57,390
This is not trash?

990
01:13:57,390 --> 01:13:59,149
This thing is fucking gross.

991
01:13:59,149 --> 01:14:03,279
What do I do with it?

992
01:14:03,279 --> 01:14:08,199
Is the bag full?

993
01:14:08,199 --> 01:14:11,710
Can I wash this in the sink?

994
01:14:11,710 --> 01:14:12,430
Bag's not full.

995
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:15,340
Now the bag is full.

996
01:14:17,930 --> 01:14:18,890
I really actually like the...

997
01:14:19,609 --> 01:14:36,159
Because you can have multiple trash bags.

998
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:37,279
All this has to go.

999
01:14:37,279 --> 01:14:52,760
What is this one?

1000
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:53,800
Okay, hold on.

1001
01:14:53,800 --> 01:15:00,670
Okay, this still stains.

1002
01:15:01,390 --> 01:15:02,189
Sell everything.

1003
01:15:02,590 --> 01:15:11,819
Um, hold on.

1004
01:15:11,819 --> 01:15:17,199
Broken glass?

1005
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:18,239
I can't pick it up.

1006
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:19,039
Maybe there's a vacuum?

1007
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:23,439
All the trash is going out here for now.

1008
01:15:23,439 --> 01:15:30,880
All right, I'm pressing R.

1009
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,460
I don't...

1010
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:33,739
It doesn't seem to do anything.

1011
01:15:33,739 --> 01:15:38,800
Can I take this down with this?

1012
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:50,189
How do I get in here?

1013
01:15:59,869 --> 01:16:02,189
Seeing that just fly out of somebody's house.

1014
01:16:02,189 --> 01:16:08,350
How do I move?

1015
01:16:08,350 --> 01:16:20,460
I want to get rid of the board.

1016
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:21,659
Okay, yeah.

1017
01:16:21,659 --> 01:16:22,989
Sell all this.

1018
01:16:22,989 --> 01:16:23,630
So they've...

1019
01:16:23,630 --> 01:16:27,920
Okay, you no longer can just throw things like this in the trash.

1020
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,279
You have to sell it.

1021
01:16:29,279 --> 01:16:44,539
Maybe they thought it was too easy to just go around and go like...

1022
01:16:44,539 --> 01:16:54,220
Just pick up everything.

1023
01:16:54,539 --> 01:16:55,979
There's a lot of stains.

1024
01:16:55,979 --> 01:16:59,880
I wonder, how does the cleaning work?

1025
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:00,600
I wonder.

1026
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:08,960
Um, maybe read a book on it.

1027
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:11,260
Love open spaces so does your hammer.

1028
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:15,869
The longer you hold the stronger will be released to see the damage.

1029
01:17:15,869 --> 01:17:21,979
Okay, so you actually have to be aiming at a wall.

1030
01:17:21,979 --> 01:17:26,189
What about just cleaning?

1031
01:17:26,189 --> 01:17:26,590
Building?

1032
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:30,119
All right.

1033
01:17:30,119 --> 01:17:33,180
Yeah, that's just like the first one.

1034
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:34,300
What about cleaning though?

1035
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:35,739
Because I have like a spray bottle.

1036
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:37,449
How does this work?

1037
01:17:38,989 --> 01:17:39,550
It's Q.

1038
01:17:40,270 --> 01:17:51,689
Is there anything in the bottle?

1039
01:17:56,989 --> 01:18:08,909
Ooh, just spray everything and then wipe it.

1040
01:18:09,470 --> 01:18:13,449
It's getting better.

1041
01:18:14,010 --> 01:18:24,000
Okay.

1042
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,439
Now, how do I mop this up?

1043
01:18:25,439 --> 01:18:26,640
Is there a vacuum or something?

1044
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:35,960
I've never seen anybody so excited to clean.

1045
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:39,359
And this game is my game.

1046
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:52,109
Painting, surface finish, smart home, building, demolish.

1047
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:53,789
So they're different now.

1048
01:18:54,510 --> 01:19:02,859
Yeah, so they've split up the tools.

1049
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:07,550
This is actually particles you have to vacuum up.

1050
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:10,319
Huge.

1051
01:19:12,090 --> 01:19:13,210
Huge addition.

1052
01:19:13,210 --> 01:19:22,329
Why is it giving me Xbox?

1053
01:19:22,329 --> 01:19:22,890
Wait.

1054
01:19:22,890 --> 01:19:38,970
Painting.

1055
01:19:38,970 --> 01:19:41,640
Paint a wall, you must buy some paint.

1056
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:43,640
Open the store by pressing tab to get to the paint.

1057
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:45,399
Paint roller.

1058
01:19:45,399 --> 01:19:46,039
Aim the bucket in.

1059
01:19:46,039 --> 01:19:46,539
Okay.

1060
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,880
Now pick your painting style and then hold it just like in the first one.

1061
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:56,699
All right.

1062
01:19:56,699 --> 01:19:57,979
So I need to go to the store.

1063
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:03,470
And I wonder how much they've actually added here.

1064
01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:07,439
So I need paint.

1065
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:15,310
I guess I can just type it, right?

1066
01:20:16,029 --> 01:20:17,840
They've added bread.

1067
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:19,199
Nice.

1068
01:20:19,199 --> 01:20:19,760
They have, yeah.

1069
01:20:20,319 --> 01:20:20,800
Look at this.

1070
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:21,359
This looks good.

1071
01:20:22,079 --> 01:20:24,670
Have a loads of bread.

1072
01:20:25,310 --> 01:20:31,199
Hey, carve me off a slice of that crusty bread.

1073
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:38,460
Let me just take a look.

1074
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:40,460
Oh, you can actually keep things.

1075
01:20:41,020 --> 01:20:42,539
I like that.

1076
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:49,819
I like that.

1077
01:20:49,819 --> 01:20:51,020
You can do plants now.

1078
01:20:51,899 --> 01:20:53,260
Building outside.

1079
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:54,539
You can tag things.

1080
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:56,489
Okay.

1081
01:20:56,489 --> 01:20:57,850
I need paint.

1082
01:20:57,850 --> 01:21:03,100
What should I do the walls?

1083
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:12,960
How about orange and red vibrant paint?

1084
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:16,159
So change size.

1085
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:19,920
Huge addition.

1086
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:32,800
Massive addition.

1087
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:33,359
Okay.

1088
01:21:33,359 --> 01:21:35,520
So you actually have to do this now.

1089
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:41,869
I feel like there's a lot more paint.

1090
01:21:41,869 --> 01:21:50,750
A big complaint for the last game was how much paint you actually had to put on the brush.

1091
01:22:04,619 --> 01:22:05,579
The noise is gross.

1092
01:22:05,579 --> 01:22:06,619
The noise is the best part.

1093
01:22:06,619 --> 01:22:07,659
What are you talking about?

1094
01:22:07,659 --> 01:22:11,560
I don't like this paint though.

1095
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:17,119
How about this one?

1096
01:22:17,119 --> 01:22:26,729
That's better.

1097
01:22:26,729 --> 01:22:31,520
It's a really, really awesome gray.

1098
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,760
Boring, boring, boring.

1099
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:44,430
No, you don't understand.

1100
01:22:44,430 --> 01:22:51,079
It's a neutral color and then you have accent pieces.

1101
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:53,979
Shut up.

1102
01:22:53,979 --> 01:22:57,949
Oops.

1103
01:22:57,949 --> 01:23:07,020
The music is really nice too.

1104
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:21,920
They really stepped it up with the soundtrack.

1105
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:24,920
That's fine.

1106
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:28,800
Turn the volume down because we need to actually make sure this is not.

1107
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:32,010
This is usually loud.

1108
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:34,239
Very, very, very loud.

1109
01:23:34,239 --> 01:23:36,590
I'm going to do it here too because I'm not.

1110
01:23:36,590 --> 01:23:37,789
Usually it's really bad.

1111
01:23:37,789 --> 01:23:39,390
Let's see.

1112
01:23:39,390 --> 01:23:46,560
It's actually not bad.

1113
01:23:46,560 --> 01:24:03,600
Is this structural?

1114
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:17,659
Watch the whole house collapses.

1115
01:24:17,659 --> 01:24:19,100
I'm opening this up a little.

1116
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:28,239
I want to be able to open up this kitchen area.

1117
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:29,680
It's a load-bearing wall.

1118
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:30,159
It's all right.

1119
01:24:30,159 --> 01:24:33,689
It's a video game.

1120
01:24:33,689 --> 01:24:34,489
We'll be all right.

1121
01:24:34,489 --> 01:24:40,569
See?

1122
01:24:40,569 --> 01:24:41,770
Look, that's much nicer.

1123
01:24:41,770 --> 01:24:50,600
All right.

1124
01:24:50,600 --> 01:25:00,960
Now get rid of all this.

1125
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:08,189
Any more trash in here?

1126
01:25:08,189 --> 01:25:13,289
This is too much work.

1127
01:25:13,289 --> 01:25:16,890
Paint the whole house one color and including all the furniture too.

1128
01:25:17,130 --> 01:25:29,100
Have everything be the same color?

1129
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:30,060
That would give me.

1130
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:33,000
I feel like that would give me anxiety being in that room

1131
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,810
because I would have a lot of questions.

1132
01:25:34,810 --> 01:25:36,250
First of all, be like, why?

1133
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:38,189
Why did you do this?

1134
01:25:38,189 --> 01:25:40,270
The second question would not even be like, why did you do this?

1135
01:25:40,270 --> 01:25:41,229
Interesting question.

1136
01:25:42,119 --> 01:25:43,239
Where did you get all this?

1137
01:25:43,239 --> 01:25:46,039
It must have taken you years to collect all this furniture.

1138
01:25:46,039 --> 01:25:47,560
That was the exact same color.

1139
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:59,789
I don't need these.

1140
01:26:01,949 --> 01:26:02,750
Damn it.

1141
01:26:02,750 --> 01:26:04,329
All right.

1142
01:26:04,329 --> 01:26:12,430
How about still two pieces of trash that I did not get?

1143
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:16,960
And where exactly are those?

1144
01:26:31,149 --> 01:26:32,029
Is it upstairs?

1145
01:26:32,670 --> 01:26:36,699
What the fuck?

1146
01:26:36,699 --> 01:26:38,159
Is it a doorbell?

1147
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:42,970
There's way more than two pieces of trash left.

1148
01:27:02,329 --> 01:27:02,810
Jesus.

1149
01:27:02,810 --> 01:27:03,289
All right.

1150
01:27:03,289 --> 01:27:12,199
Why can I not activate those things?

1151
01:27:12,199 --> 01:27:12,680
All right.

1152
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:14,760
Stains, vacuum, dirt.

1153
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:18,199
There's tons of stuff to vacuum up here.

1154
01:27:18,199 --> 01:27:19,640
You definitely can level this up too.

1155
01:27:20,279 --> 01:27:27,260
Why is there a fish in the closet?

1156
01:27:27,260 --> 01:27:28,220
I don't know.

1157
01:27:28,220 --> 01:27:31,500
It's very strange.

1158
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:52,539
I can reach really far.

1159
01:27:52,539 --> 01:28:03,210
Sell everything.

1160
01:28:03,210 --> 01:28:12,439
Need to make room so you can see where you need to clean.

1161
01:28:12,439 --> 01:28:24,729
Collecting trash.

1162
01:28:24,729 --> 01:28:25,050
Yep.

1163
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:27,689
How to do that at this point?

1164
01:28:29,609 --> 01:28:46,670
I have an idea.

1165
01:28:46,670 --> 01:28:48,189
Get out the fucking window.

1166
01:28:48,189 --> 01:28:52,250
All right.

1167
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:53,050
You can't do that.

1168
01:28:53,050 --> 01:28:55,560
I was trying to save some time.

1169
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:56,520
And what am I doing?

1170
01:28:56,520 --> 01:29:00,279
You can do it right here.

1171
01:29:00,279 --> 01:29:02,800
Damn it.

1172
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:04,079
Oh, that's too bad.

1173
01:29:04,079 --> 01:29:10,640
I'm keeping that.

1174
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:30,800
Okay.

1175
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:35,520
Buy 28.

1176
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:37,119
Oh, we need these.

1177
01:29:37,119 --> 01:29:37,359
All right.

1178
01:29:37,359 --> 01:29:37,680
Well, hold on.

1179
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:38,640
Let me sell.

1180
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:47,659
Well, I need to sell more stuff.

1181
01:29:47,659 --> 01:29:49,720
You're very precise with this.

1182
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:50,279
I tend to be.

1183
01:29:58,460 --> 01:29:59,420
This is a mess.

1184
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:10,859
Okay.

1185
01:30:10,859 --> 01:30:26,300
I think that's all the trash.

1186
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:26,779
Sell it.

1187
01:30:26,779 --> 01:30:27,180
Sell it.

1188
01:30:27,180 --> 01:30:27,819
Sell it.

1189
01:30:27,819 --> 01:30:41,850
I need to mop the walls too.

1190
01:30:41,850 --> 01:30:42,489
Can I clean this?

1191
01:30:42,489 --> 01:30:43,289
I'll try to clean it first.

1192
01:30:43,289 --> 01:30:45,819
I'm not going to sell everything.

1193
01:30:46,220 --> 01:30:53,760
Some of the junkier stuff like that and like that.

1194
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:54,399
So we can...

1195
01:30:54,399 --> 01:30:55,760
Oh, you can duplicate.

1196
01:30:55,760 --> 01:31:01,239
That's cool.

1197
01:31:01,239 --> 01:31:02,600
Sold the plunger.

1198
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:03,079
Yeah.

1199
01:31:03,079 --> 01:31:04,840
Do not ever sell your plunger.

1200
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:05,800
I saw actually a comment.

1201
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:08,539
Somebody said, what a rookie mistake.

1202
01:31:08,539 --> 01:31:10,140
You sold your plunger.

1203
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:12,619
I mean, I didn't sell my plunger,

1204
01:31:12,619 --> 01:31:13,899
but I got rid of my plunger

1205
01:31:13,899 --> 01:31:15,920
before making sure I had another one.

1206
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:17,439
That's a very big deal.

1207
01:31:17,439 --> 01:31:19,789
I will never make that mistake ever again.

1208
01:31:23,359 --> 01:31:24,880
You buy the new plunger

1209
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:40,140
before you get rid of the old one.

1210
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:43,800
You sold your used plunger.

1211
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:46,359
We're talking about in the context of this game.

1212
01:31:46,359 --> 01:31:52,029
This makes or breaks my rating for the demo so far.

1213
01:31:52,029 --> 01:32:06,380
There's an A.

1214
01:32:06,380 --> 01:32:08,189
That was an A.

1215
01:32:08,189 --> 01:32:20,680
That's an A.

1216
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:32,029
Because this one you really...

1217
01:32:32,029 --> 01:32:34,779
It's a whole lot more control here.

1218
01:32:34,779 --> 01:32:43,159
I would say it's a B minus.

1219
01:32:55,899 --> 01:32:57,520
You missed a bit.

1220
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:58,479
I got it.

1221
01:32:58,479 --> 01:33:01,789
Okay.

1222
01:33:01,789 --> 01:33:04,029
I'm going to start in this room.

1223
01:33:04,029 --> 01:33:09,470
I wonder if we're going to get anybody upset

1224
01:33:09,470 --> 01:33:10,989
that I'm in this for more than 30 minutes.

1225
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:16,680
I doubt it.

1226
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:31,550
Put all the books outside.

1227
01:33:31,550 --> 01:33:32,590
Can stack objects?

1228
01:33:33,149 --> 01:33:34,460
Could you do that before?

1229
01:33:35,020 --> 01:33:43,529
I'm not sure you could even do that before.

1230
01:33:43,529 --> 01:33:44,539
Okay.

1231
01:33:44,539 --> 01:33:47,659
I need to buy all this new shit.

1232
01:33:47,659 --> 01:33:51,720
Is that what it's telling me to do?

1233
01:33:51,720 --> 01:34:14,649
Not yet.

1234
01:34:14,649 --> 01:34:15,050
Whoa.

1235
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:32,250
Cool.

1236
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:46,760
I like that sound too.

1237
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:48,279
You couldn't do that before.

1238
01:34:48,279 --> 01:35:01,449
I could make a Super Mario level.

1239
01:35:01,449 --> 01:35:02,090
Oh my God.

1240
01:35:02,090 --> 01:35:09,199
I can make a Super Mario level.

1241
01:35:09,199 --> 01:35:10,000
No way.

1242
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:13,760
Okay.

1243
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:19,609
That's when the game comes up.

1244
01:35:19,609 --> 01:35:21,529
You can take out individual cubes now.

1245
01:35:23,609 --> 01:35:24,409
Didn't I say?

1246
01:35:24,409 --> 01:35:26,350
Didn't I say?

1247
01:35:26,350 --> 01:35:27,470
A couple of years ago.

1248
01:35:27,470 --> 01:35:32,350
Man, I wish I could place and delete individual cubes.

1249
01:35:32,430 --> 01:35:33,960
I said that.

1250
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:44,590
Didn't I say that?

1251
01:35:44,590 --> 01:35:44,989
True.

1252
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:45,229
True.

1253
01:35:45,229 --> 01:35:52,000
Yeah, I did.

1254
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:59,680
You famously said that.

1255
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:00,000
All right.

1256
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:00,479
Let's paint.

1257
01:36:01,579 --> 01:36:03,100
Are we going with just the gray?

1258
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:04,539
I like that color.

1259
01:36:04,539 --> 01:36:07,789
You can call me a normie all you want.

1260
01:36:07,789 --> 01:36:09,689
That's fine.

1261
01:36:09,689 --> 01:36:12,090
I like the like blue gray wall.

1262
01:36:13,079 --> 01:36:14,039
That's fine.

1263
01:36:14,039 --> 01:36:14,840
Go ahead.

1264
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:33,260
Blues and grays are nice.

1265
01:36:33,260 --> 01:36:33,659
I know.

1266
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:37,279
What color?

1267
01:36:37,279 --> 01:36:37,600
All right.

1268
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:38,960
Let me ask you guys this question.

1269
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:46,399
What color wall would you say is the, you know, what's your wall?

1270
01:36:46,399 --> 01:36:55,640
What is your ideal living room wall color?

1271
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:56,039
Beige?

1272
01:36:57,550 --> 01:37:05,449
If it isn't beige, just like kind of the same type of neutral that gray, light gray, light blue is.

1273
01:37:05,449 --> 01:37:06,890
Egg shell white, white, white.

1274
01:37:06,890 --> 01:37:08,890
How is white is also neutral?

1275
01:37:08,890 --> 01:37:10,329
How is that different than gray?

1276
01:37:10,329 --> 01:37:20,560
It's light blue, light green.

1277
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:22,159
I can see light green.

1278
01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:24,319
Light green would be pretty nice.

1279
01:37:24,319 --> 01:37:24,960
They're all nice.

1280
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:39,079
I can change the color if I want in a minute.

1281
01:37:39,079 --> 01:37:48,380
We have to get a base here first.

1282
01:37:48,380 --> 01:37:50,460
He's painting without paint liners.

1283
01:37:54,840 --> 01:37:55,079
Yeah.

1284
01:38:02,409 --> 01:38:03,050
Sorry.

1285
01:38:03,050 --> 01:38:06,010
I bowl without the bumpers on the sides.

1286
01:38:26,510 --> 01:38:28,750
Somebody says landlord special.

1287
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:32,279
All right.

1288
01:38:32,279 --> 01:38:33,319
I'm coming in.

1289
01:38:33,319 --> 01:38:33,800
That's right.

1290
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:34,920
We're getting, I'm going to be in there.

1291
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:36,439
We're going to do all new painting.

1292
01:38:36,439 --> 01:38:37,239
That's right.

1293
01:38:37,239 --> 01:38:39,960
Just make sure you're out of the apartment for a little while.

1294
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:42,840
Hope you like gray and I hope you're like a really shit job.

1295
01:38:44,060 --> 01:38:47,439
That's exactly where you're getting a dome depot.

1296
01:38:47,439 --> 01:38:50,560
And I just want as much of the cheapest gray paint as I could.

1297
01:38:51,199 --> 01:38:53,520
I don't need wall liners or whatever.

1298
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:56,640
I ain't living here.

1299
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:58,399
The landlord special.

1300
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:23,770
Stop painting over outlets and light switches.

1301
01:39:35,550 --> 01:39:36,270
That's funny.

1302
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,600
Painting over the tile.

1303
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:45,039
Wait, I can make the ground too.

1304
01:39:46,399 --> 01:39:47,760
You can paint the ground.

1305
01:39:49,050 --> 01:39:49,289
Yep.

1306
01:39:49,289 --> 01:39:51,609
Just coming in with the landlord special real quick.

1307
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:55,079
All right.

1308
01:39:55,640 --> 01:40:01,789
Not a problem.

1309
01:40:01,789 --> 01:40:05,470
Just trying to drop my property value by as much as I possibly can.

1310
01:40:09,390 --> 01:40:09,789
Whatever.

1311
01:40:21,529 --> 01:40:23,369
If I came in and somebody was doing this to the ground,

1312
01:40:24,779 --> 01:40:25,899
I'd be like, all right.

1313
01:40:25,899 --> 01:40:27,579
What kind of special paint is that?

1314
01:40:27,579 --> 01:40:31,500
Because you obviously you're doing that because you're trying to block

1315
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:33,659
like radiation or something, right?

1316
01:40:33,659 --> 01:40:34,539
Like why?

1317
01:40:34,539 --> 01:40:35,899
What are you painting the ground for?

1318
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:42,159
Well, you know, I heard that there was a radiation could come through the floor.

1319
01:40:42,159 --> 01:40:46,800
So I want to make sure I have the code of this anti radiation paint.

1320
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:54,119
All right.

1321
01:40:54,119 --> 01:40:58,779
I was just my grandmother's favorite color was, you know, dark gray.

1322
01:40:59,340 --> 01:41:02,380
I figured I had to see my entire fucking house around it.

1323
01:41:02,939 --> 01:41:11,529
What is that?

1324
01:41:11,529 --> 01:41:12,170
What is that?

1325
01:41:12,170 --> 01:41:12,729
What is that?

1326
01:41:16,489 --> 01:41:18,220
Get rid of that.

1327
01:41:18,779 --> 01:41:20,810
Oops.

1328
01:41:22,510 --> 01:41:24,430
Wait, did I throw trash into the ocean?

1329
01:41:25,399 --> 01:41:26,039
Wait a minute.

1330
01:41:26,039 --> 01:41:26,680
No, you can't.

1331
01:41:27,399 --> 01:41:29,819
No, that's fucked up.

1332
01:41:29,819 --> 01:41:30,539
That's not all right.

1333
01:41:31,100 --> 01:41:32,140
Did it work?

1334
01:41:45,149 --> 01:41:53,710
Uh, I mean, it is a perfectly good bin outside, but you know,

1335
01:41:53,710 --> 01:41:59,039
I'll just throw it in the ocean.

1336
01:41:59,039 --> 01:41:59,520
Wait, hold on.

1337
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:02,399
Wait, wait, is there plastic in here and glass?

1338
01:42:03,199 --> 01:42:04,699
Yeah, whatever.

1339
01:42:06,810 --> 01:42:07,930
I don't want to separate that.

1340
01:42:07,930 --> 01:42:09,050
It's too much work for me.

1341
01:42:09,770 --> 01:42:29,550
See, I will reform the evil landlord villain.

1342
01:42:31,640 --> 01:42:32,520
Recycling now.

1343
01:42:36,159 --> 01:42:48,520
See, okay.

1344
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:50,359
You can't paint the sand.

1345
01:42:50,359 --> 01:43:01,880
Okay, cool.

1346
01:43:02,890 --> 01:43:09,770
Well, it definitely feels like there's a lot more control.

1347
01:43:09,770 --> 01:43:12,489
I think you can build houses in this too.

1348
01:43:12,489 --> 01:43:14,489
Maybe not the demo, but I'm pretty sure that's what they're going to do.

1349
01:43:15,050 --> 01:43:17,659
I need something out.

1350
01:43:17,659 --> 01:43:19,500
This actually is making me annoyed to look at.

1351
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:24,479
Um, let's go over the ground.

1352
01:43:24,479 --> 01:43:26,079
I don't know, like wood tile.

1353
01:43:29,529 --> 01:43:30,250
Wood panels.

1354
01:43:36,079 --> 01:43:36,880
Carpet.

1355
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:38,569
What about tile?

1356
01:43:38,569 --> 01:43:39,369
What do they have tile?

1357
01:43:41,310 --> 01:43:42,430
Ooh, look at that.

1358
01:43:43,069 --> 01:43:43,630
I like this.

1359
01:43:44,189 --> 01:44:16,250
Oh, there's a picture of a tile.

1360
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:17,850
Oh, I have to surface.

1361
01:44:17,850 --> 01:44:21,560
I, right.

1362
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:28,159
Oh, let's do a test.

1363
01:44:28,159 --> 01:44:33,390
Cool.

1364
01:44:33,390 --> 01:44:34,829
That's way better than it used to be.

1365
01:44:45,529 --> 01:45:05,560
Wow.

1366
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:10,090
Look at how cool that looks.

1367
01:45:10,090 --> 01:45:18,060
How do I put this down though?

1368
01:45:18,060 --> 01:45:19,180
And go back to the tools.

1369
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:23,960
Hold right mouse button.

1370
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:25,869
It was weird.

1371
01:45:25,869 --> 01:45:30,770
Oops.

1372
01:45:31,250 --> 01:45:36,140
It's like the ocean next to the ocean.

1373
01:45:36,140 --> 01:45:37,840
That's what I was going for.

1374
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:49,279
That's what I want to be.

1375
01:45:49,279 --> 01:45:53,119
I want to go to like a beach and just lie there and just breathe in the air.

1376
01:45:53,920 --> 01:46:00,720
How come the grid is here still?

1377
01:46:01,439 --> 01:46:09,460
Okay.

1378
01:46:09,460 --> 01:46:10,659
Oh, there we go.

1379
01:46:10,659 --> 01:46:11,460
Nice.

1380
01:46:11,460 --> 01:46:19,810
I'm telling you right now, I'm going to give you a little bit of creative input here.

1381
01:46:19,810 --> 01:46:26,859
This has like a streamer room back wall that slowly has the lights kind of move and pulsate

1382
01:46:26,859 --> 01:46:28,930
through here.

1383
01:46:28,930 --> 01:46:31,810
Wow.

1384
01:46:31,810 --> 01:46:38,699
If this was just kind of like, and this kind of was a was a glowing soft green.

1385
01:46:39,710 --> 01:46:40,029
Whoa.

1386
01:46:40,750 --> 01:46:51,229
I'll give you a little bit of creative input.

1387
01:46:51,229 --> 01:46:52,350
Are you the streamer?

1388
01:46:52,350 --> 01:46:52,909
No.

1389
01:46:52,909 --> 01:46:53,630
Oh, God.

1390
01:46:53,630 --> 01:46:54,829
No, I wouldn't have that.

1391
01:46:54,829 --> 01:47:06,319
Oh, God.

1392
01:47:06,319 --> 01:47:07,840
No, that would be fucking tacky.

1393
01:47:09,949 --> 01:47:11,710
You don't catch me fucking doing that.

1394
01:47:12,350 --> 01:47:21,630
Having like a back wall that's like water next to and you're in like your beach house

1395
01:47:21,630 --> 01:47:22,430
and pulses.

1396
01:47:24,100 --> 01:47:28,100
And this kind of goes, no, would never catch me doing that.

1397
01:47:28,659 --> 01:47:35,310
I want to do it so bad.

1398
01:47:56,430 --> 01:48:02,899
Let's go with like a, what should I do here?

1399
01:48:02,899 --> 01:48:04,579
Smart home options.

1400
01:48:04,579 --> 01:48:08,859
Okay.

1401
01:48:08,859 --> 01:48:15,710
Wait, can I have this connected to the stove?

1402
01:48:15,710 --> 01:48:16,350
All right.

1403
01:48:16,350 --> 01:48:19,390
Can the light switch turn the stove on?

1404
01:48:19,390 --> 01:48:26,510
That's a very important question.

1405
01:48:26,510 --> 01:48:40,140
We're going to find out.

1406
01:48:40,140 --> 01:48:41,659
Magic beans.

1407
01:48:41,659 --> 01:48:48,140
Oh, I can see it already.

1408
01:48:48,140 --> 01:48:58,029
All right.

1409
01:48:58,029 --> 01:48:58,750
Let's get rid of this.

1410
01:48:59,310 --> 01:49:07,859
You missed a spot.

1411
01:49:07,859 --> 01:49:09,300
I need to clear everything out.

1412
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:15,810
I don't like.

1413
01:49:17,010 --> 01:49:32,289
TV goes right here.

1414
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:37,680
Where's the kitchen?

1415
01:49:37,680 --> 01:49:38,159
I don't know.

1416
01:49:40,689 --> 01:49:42,210
Now you like it all of a sudden.

1417
01:49:42,210 --> 01:49:42,930
Okay.

1418
01:49:42,930 --> 01:49:43,489
Yeah.

1419
01:49:43,489 --> 01:49:50,819
So how does, how do I clean this?

1420
01:49:50,819 --> 01:49:56,180
Do I have to mop it or vacuum it?

1421
01:49:56,180 --> 01:49:56,420
Okay.

1422
01:49:56,420 --> 01:50:09,939
Yeah.

1423
01:50:09,939 --> 01:50:13,789
No, I'm throwing this upside down.

1424
01:50:13,789 --> 01:50:20,079
Every kitchen usually is that kind of like beige, sand, brown, yellows.

1425
01:50:20,079 --> 01:50:25,140
That's a lot of kitchens, especially that I'm going different.

1426
01:50:25,140 --> 01:50:27,060
I'm doing like a green kitchen.

1427
01:50:27,060 --> 01:50:44,189
Okay.

1428
01:50:44,189 --> 01:50:47,039
I need floor, floor.

1429
01:50:47,039 --> 01:50:53,470
I need something for the floor, floor board.

1430
01:50:53,470 --> 01:51:07,420
Is there a way to quickly get to just like, there we go.

1431
01:51:07,420 --> 01:51:07,920
Okay.

1432
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:12,520
Um, just, I want like floor stuff.

1433
01:51:12,520 --> 01:51:24,840
Construction, surface finishes, particle board, cool green paint.

1434
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:25,560
Let's try it.

1435
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:28,600
I feel like this is going to look all right.

1436
01:51:28,600 --> 01:51:45,380
How do I use the paint tape?

1437
01:51:45,380 --> 01:52:13,359
The paint tape.

1438
01:52:13,359 --> 01:52:14,720
Paint tape.

1439
01:52:14,720 --> 01:52:21,039
When does this come out?

1440
01:52:21,039 --> 01:52:23,760
When does the house number two come out?

1441
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:24,479
I like it.

1442
01:52:24,479 --> 01:52:43,350
It's not bad.

1443
01:52:43,350 --> 01:52:54,399
I need to go outside and sell all these.

1444
01:52:54,399 --> 01:52:56,239
Nice infected armpit green.

1445
01:52:56,239 --> 01:52:57,760
Why do you know what that is?

1446
01:52:57,760 --> 01:52:59,960
That's what?

1447
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:01,859
Infected armpit.

1448
01:53:01,859 --> 01:53:07,890
This looks nice.

1449
01:53:07,890 --> 01:53:18,520
Let's get to clean the windows up and we're good.

1450
01:53:37,439 --> 01:53:41,539
I hope your stomach is doing better.

1451
01:53:41,539 --> 01:53:42,869
Yeah, I'll be all right.

1452
01:53:42,869 --> 01:53:45,329
I'm good.

1453
01:53:45,329 --> 01:53:51,920
I just had to take care of that before the stream started.

1454
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:53,279
I'm good though.

1455
01:53:53,279 --> 01:53:56,039
Make it bluer.

1456
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:06,279
Uh, I mean, we've got cyan and gray.

1457
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:09,220
We all know how much I like that one.

1458
01:54:15,720 --> 01:54:16,680
Blue paint.

1459
01:54:16,680 --> 01:54:22,470
Maybe, should I try the blue?

1460
01:54:22,470 --> 01:54:23,430
Cyan and gray.

1461
01:54:23,430 --> 01:54:25,109
Cyan and gray vibrant.

1462
01:54:25,109 --> 01:54:25,829
Faded.

1463
01:54:25,829 --> 01:54:26,949
Let's try this one.

1464
01:54:26,949 --> 01:54:31,920
This apparently is vibrant.

1465
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:36,659
I wouldn't call that vibrant.

1466
01:54:36,659 --> 01:54:41,409
This is almost too blue.

1467
01:54:41,409 --> 01:54:45,039
No, no, no, no.

1468
01:54:45,039 --> 01:54:46,479
That's way too blue.

1469
01:54:46,479 --> 01:54:47,199
Way too much.

1470
01:54:47,199 --> 01:54:48,319
The green is better.

1471
01:54:48,319 --> 01:55:03,329
Green is better.

1472
01:55:03,329 --> 01:55:04,770
Landlord special.

1473
01:55:04,770 --> 01:55:06,979
What are you doing?

1474
01:55:06,979 --> 01:55:11,779
Oh, I'm just putting all these buckets of paint under one giant bucket.

1475
01:55:11,779 --> 01:55:13,920
Oh, what are you going to do with it?

1476
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:16,560
I plan on throwing it as hard as I can against the wall.

1477
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:17,439
Right in the middle.

1478
01:55:17,439 --> 01:55:21,239
Combining four or five buckets of paint.

1479
01:55:21,239 --> 01:55:27,619
Hey, while you're here, can you look at the sink?

1480
01:55:28,260 --> 01:55:28,979
No, no.

1481
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:32,770
No, I don't think so.

1482
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:35,960
Rents do, by the way.

1483
01:55:48,020 --> 01:55:48,899
I like it.

1484
01:55:48,899 --> 01:55:49,300
All right.

1485
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:51,460
Now, this is going to stay...

1486
01:55:51,460 --> 01:56:03,640
Where did all this come from?

1487
01:56:03,640 --> 01:56:04,119
It's trash.

1488
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:11,909
Did I break a window?

1489
01:56:11,909 --> 01:56:12,390
Why?

1490
01:56:12,390 --> 01:56:13,510
I thought I cleaned this already.

1491
01:56:14,149 --> 01:56:17,109
What's up with this?

1492
01:56:17,109 --> 01:56:17,670
What is that?

1493
01:56:18,550 --> 01:56:21,189
This one thing that didn't get painted right?

1494
01:56:21,189 --> 01:56:25,109
Get a girl out.

1495
01:56:29,319 --> 01:56:30,199
What about the ground?

1496
01:56:45,359 --> 01:56:46,899
I'll try this.

1497
01:56:46,899 --> 01:56:48,600
I just want to see what it looks like.

1498
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:49,399
That's it.

1499
01:56:49,399 --> 01:57:02,449
We're going to do a small test to see how it is.

1500
01:57:02,449 --> 01:57:20,930
I need to pick it up.

1501
01:57:20,930 --> 01:57:22,289
Hold to start finishing.

1502
01:57:23,989 --> 01:57:25,859
I want to...

1503
01:57:25,859 --> 01:57:26,819
Wait, is it...

1504
01:57:26,819 --> 01:57:29,000
What's happening?

1505
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,970
Well, I want to pick these up.

1506
01:57:31,970 --> 01:57:43,520
Can I not press E?

1507
01:57:44,399 --> 01:57:46,439
Oh, this is weird.

1508
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:50,979
How high are you right now?

1509
01:57:50,979 --> 01:57:52,260
No, it's just I'm not used to it.

1510
01:57:52,260 --> 01:57:54,960
Because you have to do this part first

1511
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:57,359
and then you put this away

1512
01:57:57,359 --> 01:57:58,880
and then pick up the tiles

1513
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:03,729
and then press E here.

1514
01:58:03,729 --> 01:58:04,050
Okay.

1515
01:58:06,210 --> 01:58:07,010
I'm not a...

1516
01:58:07,010 --> 01:58:08,210
I'm a big fan of it, actually.

1517
01:58:12,979 --> 01:58:14,579
It reflects everything.

1518
01:58:14,579 --> 01:58:17,090
I'm going to do it.

1519
01:58:17,090 --> 01:58:17,810
Yeah, I'm going to do it.

1520
01:58:17,810 --> 01:58:18,210
That's cool.

1521
01:58:22,289 --> 01:58:23,010
That's how you do it.

1522
01:58:23,010 --> 01:58:23,649
Okay.

1523
01:58:23,649 --> 01:58:27,010
Now, I can't technically go out of here.

1524
01:58:27,010 --> 01:58:32,319
I like it.

1525
01:58:32,319 --> 01:58:33,039
You did good.

1526
01:58:33,039 --> 01:58:48,470
Hey, thanks.

1527
01:58:48,470 --> 01:58:49,270
Cool.

1528
01:58:49,270 --> 01:59:01,909
You're making a Hilton hotel.

1529
01:59:01,909 --> 01:59:07,810
This place is pretty nice.

1530
01:59:07,810 --> 01:59:19,350
I like it.

1531
01:59:19,350 --> 01:59:21,560
I just need a stove and a fridge.

1532
01:59:21,560 --> 01:59:23,329
I'm going to see if I can make this stove

1533
01:59:23,329 --> 01:59:25,810
turn on with this switch right here.

1534
01:59:25,810 --> 01:59:27,539
We'll get...

1535
01:59:27,539 --> 01:59:28,899
Hold on.

1536
01:59:28,899 --> 01:59:32,609
We're getting to about an hour in this game.

1537
01:59:32,609 --> 01:59:34,050
We're like 40 minutes into this game.

1538
01:59:36,449 --> 01:59:37,810
There's other demos to play.

1539
01:59:37,810 --> 01:59:43,279
I'm going to give this another 10 to 15 minutes

1540
01:59:43,279 --> 01:59:49,510
and we'll move on to the next one.

1541
01:59:49,510 --> 01:59:52,199
I saved the first two to do first

1542
01:59:52,199 --> 01:59:52,920
because I knew it was going to take

1543
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:53,560
the most amount of time.

1544
01:59:54,119 --> 01:59:57,600
Lies of P and House Lipper 2.

1545
02:00:03,539 --> 02:00:03,939
Don't worry.

1546
02:00:03,939 --> 02:00:05,140
If you don't think I'm going to play this

1547
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:07,880
until I puke when it comes out,

1548
02:00:08,819 --> 02:00:09,859
you're dreaming.

1549
02:00:09,859 --> 02:00:10,500
All right.

1550
02:00:10,500 --> 02:00:18,069
What do I want to do?

1551
02:00:18,069 --> 02:00:18,949
Fridge.

1552
02:00:18,949 --> 02:00:20,550
Let's go.

1553
02:00:20,550 --> 02:00:21,510
Fridge.

1554
02:00:21,510 --> 02:00:30,279
It's like a...

1555
02:00:35,329 --> 02:00:36,130
It's a beach house.

1556
02:00:36,689 --> 02:00:42,050
I can't open it.

1557
02:00:42,689 --> 02:00:43,909
Oops.

1558
02:00:56,039 --> 02:00:57,479
No, I want a real fridge.

1559
02:00:57,479 --> 02:01:04,000
I mean, it is a real fridge, but this one matches.

1560
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,710
That matches what I'm going for.

1561
02:01:06,710 --> 02:01:20,960
Are you going for ugly?

1562
02:01:20,960 --> 02:01:22,399
I'm going for swanky.

1563
02:01:22,399 --> 02:01:34,640
I can't paint it.

1564
02:01:34,640 --> 02:01:56,399
Okay.

1565
02:01:56,399 --> 02:02:00,180
Nice.

1566
02:02:00,180 --> 02:02:05,970
I like how the Twitch has the warning

1567
02:02:05,970 --> 02:02:07,409
that this says the stream is content

1568
02:02:07,409 --> 02:02:08,529
for mature audiences,

1569
02:02:08,529 --> 02:02:09,810
but you're playing House Flipper.

1570
02:02:09,810 --> 02:02:11,489
I'm assuming that's what you said after that.

1571
02:02:11,489 --> 02:02:19,590
I mean, that's on every stream.

1572
02:02:19,590 --> 02:02:20,710
I've never turned that off.

1573
02:02:25,090 --> 02:02:27,010
I think they changed it

1574
02:02:27,010 --> 02:02:29,109
to now it's more elaborate system,

1575
02:02:29,109 --> 02:02:43,619
but that's been on forever because he swears.

1576
02:02:46,550 --> 02:02:49,239
I mean, I would consider this stream

1577
02:02:49,239 --> 02:02:50,600
to be a mature audience stream.

1578
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:02,960
He's M-rated.

1579
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:04,000
I think so.

1580
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:10,600
Guys, a running joke on the channel

1581
02:03:10,600 --> 02:03:12,920
was about me shoving a baseball up my ass.

1582
02:03:12,920 --> 02:03:15,920
Yeah, I'm going to keep the mature audience filter on.

1583
02:03:18,789 --> 02:03:19,750
I think it should stay.

1584
02:03:39,140 --> 02:03:40,739
I'm getting really comfy right now

1585
02:03:40,739 --> 02:03:42,960
and I'll stay here all day.

1586
02:03:45,670 --> 02:03:47,109
Okay, we're moving on.

1587
02:03:47,109 --> 02:03:47,829
I got to move on.

1588
02:03:47,829 --> 02:03:49,279
I'll stay here all day.

1589
02:03:49,279 --> 02:03:51,119
I love these games so much.

1590
02:03:51,119 --> 02:03:55,560
I'm ready to play this when it releases.

1591
02:03:55,560 --> 02:03:57,079
I like the new features.

1592
02:03:57,079 --> 02:04:01,680
I think there's a lot more control now.

1593
02:04:01,680 --> 02:04:03,039
It seems like it's going to be fun.

1594
02:04:08,310 --> 02:04:09,750
Think of how much content there'll be

1595
02:04:09,750 --> 02:04:10,310
when this releases.

1596
02:04:10,310 --> 02:04:10,949
When does this come up?

1597
02:04:12,609 --> 02:04:13,170
Test the stove.

1598
02:04:13,170 --> 02:04:14,210
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1599
02:04:14,210 --> 02:04:37,399
I don't think you can do it.

1600
02:04:37,399 --> 02:04:39,319
Should do another House Flipper thing with Ludwig.

1601
02:04:40,210 --> 02:04:43,170
I think that when this game comes out,

1602
02:04:43,170 --> 02:04:45,409
I have a very fun idea

1603
02:04:45,409 --> 02:04:46,850
and it's kind of like the thing

1604
02:04:46,850 --> 02:04:50,130
that we did on the stream I did with Ludwig.

1605
02:04:50,949 --> 02:04:52,149
Imagine a stream.

1606
02:04:52,149 --> 02:04:53,029
Don't steal this.

1607
02:04:53,029 --> 02:04:53,989
It's mine.

1608
02:04:53,989 --> 02:04:55,109
I'm the House Flipper guy.

1609
02:04:55,750 --> 02:04:58,239
You know what?

1610
02:04:58,239 --> 02:04:59,600
Never mind.

1611
02:04:59,600 --> 02:05:00,159
You'll steal it.

1612
02:05:00,159 --> 02:05:00,880
Somebody will steal it.

1613
02:05:07,350 --> 02:05:11,199
No, you're going to steal it.

1614
02:05:11,199 --> 02:05:14,579
Bro, no, you're going to steal it.

1615
02:05:14,579 --> 02:05:16,659
And then you'll get 100 billion views and I won't.

1616
02:05:17,220 --> 02:05:21,000
All right, this is cool.

1617
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:21,720
I like it a lot.

1618
02:05:21,720 --> 02:05:23,079
I'm looking forward when it comes out.

1619
02:05:23,079 --> 02:05:23,640
Wishlist.

1620
02:05:26,659 --> 02:05:29,779
Dude, HGTV did this 19 years ago.

1621
02:05:33,539 --> 02:05:34,180
I'm kidding around.

1622
02:05:34,180 --> 02:05:39,779
I want to get streamers to make houses in this game and judge them.

1623
02:05:39,779 --> 02:05:41,779
So at the same time, everybody makes a house.

1624
02:05:41,779 --> 02:05:44,659
You know, you got like six, seven, eight potential streamers.

1625
02:05:44,659 --> 02:05:45,619
They all make a house.

1626
02:05:45,619 --> 02:05:48,319
They all have the same amount of time.

1627
02:05:48,319 --> 02:05:51,399
And I go through and have to grade them.

1628
02:05:53,479 --> 02:05:56,039
I think that's fun.

1629
02:05:56,039 --> 02:05:56,920
You literally did that.

1630
02:05:56,920 --> 02:06:01,560
Yeah, but I'm talking about much more elaborate.

1631
02:06:01,560 --> 02:06:01,960
Stolen.

1632
02:06:01,960 --> 02:06:02,439
Here it comes.

1633
02:06:02,439 --> 02:06:06,289
That's fine.

1634
02:06:06,289 --> 02:06:10,840
I walk around with a clipboard and it's me judging it.

1635
02:06:10,840 --> 02:06:12,119
You have terrible taste.

1636
02:06:12,119 --> 02:06:13,960
I think that's why I want to do it.

1637
02:06:13,960 --> 02:06:23,409
Community house building.

1638
02:06:26,439 --> 02:06:27,960
No one could steal this.

1639
02:06:29,510 --> 02:06:34,050
I know that elaborate idea of play house flipper and I grade your house.

1640
02:06:34,930 --> 02:06:38,289
Whoa, we're talking fucking gold.

1641
02:06:38,289 --> 02:06:41,960
All right, let's keep going.

1642
02:06:41,960 --> 02:06:42,439
That was fun.

1643
02:06:42,439 --> 02:06:43,159
I really like it.

1644
02:06:43,159 --> 02:06:49,720
What am I going to play next?

1645
02:06:49,720 --> 02:07:06,340
How about I could do we do a bunch in a row now

1646
02:07:06,340 --> 02:07:09,539
because those are the ones I knew I wanted to at least hang out in for like a few minutes.

1647
02:07:09,539 --> 02:07:10,600
What?

1648
02:07:10,600 --> 02:07:11,800
Where did my steam go?

1649
02:07:11,800 --> 02:07:16,720
I think my steam crashed.

1650
02:07:16,720 --> 02:07:23,079
Yeah.

1651
02:07:23,079 --> 02:07:25,560
Oh, shit.

1652
02:07:25,560 --> 02:07:30,529
That was my steam.

1653
02:07:34,399 --> 02:07:35,920
Well, let's try this again.

1654
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:45,520
Well, my steam is messed up.

1655
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:49,000
I can't even open steam anymore.

1656
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:50,050
This is weird.

1657
02:07:56,289 --> 02:07:56,850
Hold on.

1658
02:07:58,229 --> 02:07:58,949
Take a break anyways.

1659
02:07:58,949 --> 02:07:59,750
I'll be right back.

1660
02:07:59,750 --> 02:08:04,199
I'll take a quick break.

1661
02:08:04,199 --> 02:08:07,560
Get this fixed and use the bathroom.

1662
02:08:07,560 --> 02:10:36,000
See you in a minute.

1663
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,560
Okay, I'm back.

1664
02:10:38,560 --> 02:10:39,279
I fixed it.

1665
02:10:39,279 --> 02:10:40,319
I had to restart steam.

1666
02:10:44,640 --> 02:10:51,840
The next demo we're going to check out is called pull stay.

1667
02:10:51,840 --> 02:10:53,039
Pull stay.

1668
02:10:54,819 --> 02:10:56,640
Beat him up.

1669
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:58,560
Tower defense mechanics?

1670
02:10:58,560 --> 02:11:02,289
I don't know.

1671
02:11:02,289 --> 02:11:03,170
Looked interesting.

1672
02:11:03,170 --> 02:11:04,600
Let's try it.

1673
02:11:14,390 --> 02:11:14,949
Controller.

1674
02:11:15,989 --> 02:11:16,550
Let me try it.

1675
02:11:22,850 --> 02:11:36,819
That's a weird resolution.

1676
02:11:36,819 --> 02:11:37,300
Pull stay.

1677
02:11:37,300 --> 02:11:37,939
Here it is.

1678
02:11:37,939 --> 02:11:45,399
I don't know if it's too loud.

1679
02:11:45,960 --> 02:11:53,829
Play.

1680
02:11:53,829 --> 02:11:54,470
Move, run.

1681
02:11:55,189 --> 02:11:59,140
Okay.

1682
02:12:00,180 --> 02:12:01,189
Attack, jump.

1683
02:12:01,189 --> 02:12:01,510
There we go.

1684
02:12:01,510 --> 02:12:01,989
All right.

1685
02:12:01,989 --> 02:12:07,939
Attack, jump.

1686
02:12:07,939 --> 02:12:08,340
All right.

1687
02:12:08,340 --> 02:12:09,300
Plus one ore.

1688
02:12:11,250 --> 02:12:13,880
Grab an enemy to throw.

1689
02:12:13,880 --> 02:12:18,819
How do you grab an enemy?

1690
02:12:18,819 --> 02:12:25,729
You can run over enemies.

1691
02:12:26,369 --> 02:12:27,319
Oh, you run.

1692
02:12:27,319 --> 02:12:28,039
You walk into them.

1693
02:12:28,039 --> 02:12:36,739
I see.

1694
02:12:36,739 --> 02:12:38,739
Run over enemies on the ground.

1695
02:12:38,739 --> 02:12:39,939
Interact objects.

1696
02:12:39,939 --> 02:12:43,960
Okay.

1697
02:12:46,050 --> 02:12:46,930
They are coming.

1698
02:12:47,489 --> 02:12:49,960
How do I use the chair?

1699
02:12:50,520 --> 02:12:51,800
Please help me, Robo.

1700
02:12:51,800 --> 02:12:53,479
I'm here on the second floor.

1701
02:12:53,479 --> 02:12:54,760
Make sure nobody comes into my room.

1702
02:13:03,380 --> 02:13:03,779
Oh, shit.

1703
02:13:03,779 --> 02:13:05,539
I got to go to the second floor like right now.

1704
02:13:05,539 --> 02:13:16,739
Can I run faster?

1705
02:13:16,739 --> 02:13:17,640
Choose an item.

1706
02:13:18,630 --> 02:13:19,430
Lower damage.

1707
02:13:19,989 --> 02:13:20,869
Increase attack power.

1708
02:13:25,119 --> 02:13:26,159
Where is this dude's room?

1709
02:13:28,210 --> 02:13:29,569
I'm up on the second floor, right?

1710
02:13:30,369 --> 02:13:33,539
Oh, here we go.

1711
02:13:35,119 --> 02:13:35,359
All right.

1712
02:13:35,359 --> 02:13:36,319
I'm here to protect you.

1713
02:13:47,010 --> 02:13:47,649
Help me.

1714
02:13:47,649 --> 02:13:48,050
Soon.

1715
02:13:49,640 --> 02:13:51,319
Someone came upstairs.

1716
02:13:51,319 --> 02:13:53,460
I can hear footsteps almost here.

1717
02:13:54,180 --> 02:13:54,739
Hey, Robo.

1718
02:13:54,739 --> 02:13:55,460
Don't forget that.

1719
02:13:55,779 --> 02:13:58,100
You can teleport toward me when I am cornered.

1720
02:13:58,659 --> 02:14:00,420
Press attack and jump at the same time.

1721
02:14:00,979 --> 02:14:03,060
It will unleash rising tackle.

1722
02:14:03,920 --> 02:14:05,840
You would lose your health accordingly, though.

1723
02:14:06,479 --> 02:14:12,979
All right.

1724
02:14:12,979 --> 02:14:13,380
Watch out.

1725
02:14:13,380 --> 02:14:14,100
I got to get out there.

1726
02:14:14,659 --> 02:14:22,800
Don't worry.

1727
02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:23,359
They won't get in.

1728
02:14:34,739 --> 02:14:35,829
Good.

1729
02:14:35,829 --> 02:14:39,510
You learned Goran Nappa while running.

1730
02:14:40,229 --> 02:14:42,130
How do you run?

1731
02:14:42,770 --> 02:14:49,439
I feel like they will be back soon.

1732
02:14:49,439 --> 02:14:49,680
Okay.

1733
02:14:50,319 --> 02:14:54,000
Let's prepare for that while open homework menu.

1734
02:14:56,800 --> 02:14:59,670
Uh, attack bar.

1735
02:15:00,310 --> 02:15:02,960
You can sit.

1736
02:15:03,520 --> 02:15:03,760
Hold on.

1737
02:15:03,760 --> 02:15:04,319
What does it say?

1738
02:15:04,319 --> 02:15:04,640
Dang.

1739
02:15:04,640 --> 02:15:06,560
They're coming back with their friend.

1740
02:15:07,199 --> 02:15:10,130
I felt this would happen.

1741
02:15:11,010 --> 02:15:11,649
Oh, no.

1742
02:15:12,449 --> 02:15:18,210
So I should go downstairs.

1743
02:15:18,770 --> 02:15:23,970
Can I go back downstairs?

1744
02:15:25,909 --> 02:15:30,050
Tap when the stairs room or second floor.

1745
02:15:33,989 --> 02:15:34,710
Almost done.

1746
02:15:35,430 --> 02:15:37,319
Oh, he's making my upgrade.

1747
02:15:38,039 --> 02:15:47,989
I want to use that sword more.

1748
02:15:56,739 --> 02:15:57,060
All right.

1749
02:15:58,439 --> 02:15:58,760
Get him.

1750
02:15:58,760 --> 02:15:59,000
All right.

1751
02:15:59,000 --> 02:15:59,239
We're good.

1752
02:15:59,239 --> 02:15:59,560
We're good.

1753
02:16:00,119 --> 02:16:01,810
Only one more enemy.

1754
02:16:07,569 --> 02:16:08,289
Thank you, Robo.

1755
02:16:10,369 --> 02:16:12,850
Now we have a time to prepare for the next wave.

1756
02:16:13,409 --> 02:16:14,710
All right.

1757
02:16:14,710 --> 02:16:21,970
Give it to me.

1758
02:16:21,970 --> 02:16:22,689
Change weapon.

1759
02:16:25,600 --> 02:16:26,800
What should I use?

1760
02:16:26,800 --> 02:16:28,319
The flute?

1761
02:16:29,119 --> 02:16:31,010
What is that?

1762
02:16:31,010 --> 02:16:33,079
I'm using the triangle.

1763
02:16:33,079 --> 02:16:39,159
Yeah.

1764
02:16:39,159 --> 02:16:40,440
What is going on?

1765
02:16:46,079 --> 02:16:46,479
Why?

1766
02:16:46,479 --> 02:16:47,440
Why am I doing this?

1767
02:16:48,239 --> 02:17:01,379
How do I do this?

1768
02:17:02,020 --> 02:17:11,040
How do I hit the ball?

1769
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:17,239
Oh, okay.

1770
02:17:17,239 --> 02:17:19,510
I did it.

1771
02:17:19,510 --> 02:17:20,149
Motivated.

1772
02:17:23,569 --> 02:17:24,770
What is going on?

1773
02:17:25,489 --> 02:17:29,959
Is somebody breaking into our neighbor's house?

1774
02:17:30,520 --> 02:17:37,440
It's time for some free time.

1775
02:17:38,920 --> 02:17:40,440
Oh, all right.

1776
02:17:40,440 --> 02:17:41,239
I got my upgrade.

1777
02:17:45,860 --> 02:18:01,239
Make another one.

1778
02:18:01,239 --> 02:18:01,959
I love this.

1779
02:18:03,799 --> 02:18:05,159
It's got a charm to it.

1780
02:18:06,870 --> 02:18:14,790
I'm interested in what you do with the actual stuff on the top.

1781
02:18:15,670 --> 02:18:16,950
You've ore and crystals.

1782
02:18:19,680 --> 02:18:25,139
I have no idea what's going on, but I'm curious.

1783
02:18:27,110 --> 02:18:27,590
Press B.

1784
02:18:29,250 --> 02:18:29,969
He's not done making it.

1785
02:18:33,969 --> 02:18:34,129
All right.

1786
02:18:34,129 --> 02:18:34,530
Here they come.

1787
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:42,799
Where do they actually come in from?

1788
02:18:43,360 --> 02:18:45,000
Is this the dollhouse?

1789
02:18:48,120 --> 02:18:48,840
It kind of is.

1790
02:18:49,479 --> 02:18:54,709
Am I dead?

1791
02:18:54,709 --> 02:18:54,950
No.

1792
02:18:58,500 --> 02:18:59,139
All right.

1793
02:18:59,139 --> 02:19:04,870
I'm going to die.

1794
02:19:05,430 --> 02:19:10,899
How do I get away from that?

1795
02:19:17,280 --> 02:19:18,719
You learned knee kick.

1796
02:19:27,879 --> 02:19:28,680
They tricked us.

1797
02:19:29,239 --> 02:19:32,639
They're breaking into our backyard.

1798
02:19:33,280 --> 02:19:37,299
Buddy, go cover the west side.

1799
02:19:37,860 --> 02:19:44,610
Do I have any heals?

1800
02:19:44,610 --> 02:19:51,909
Fuck out of here.

1801
02:20:02,850 --> 02:20:04,290
I'm dead if I get hit once.

1802
02:20:04,290 --> 02:20:17,329
Holy shit.

1803
02:20:17,329 --> 02:20:18,530
What just happened?

1804
02:20:18,530 --> 02:20:24,000
All right.

1805
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:25,280
Beat the first level.

1806
02:20:25,280 --> 02:20:34,309
They are coming.

1807
02:20:34,309 --> 02:20:36,610
Are you almost done with that upgrade?

1808
02:20:36,610 --> 02:20:37,090
Come on.

1809
02:20:37,090 --> 02:20:37,889
Hurry up.

1810
02:20:37,889 --> 02:20:41,989
Make sure nobody comes in my room.

1811
02:20:41,989 --> 02:20:42,229
All right.

1812
02:20:42,229 --> 02:20:42,629
I got you.

1813
02:20:43,270 --> 02:20:52,719
You learned karate kick.

1814
02:20:52,719 --> 02:21:00,579
What is this guy eating?

1815
02:21:04,950 --> 02:21:05,889
Attack power up.

1816
02:21:05,889 --> 02:21:06,690
We're good.

1817
02:21:06,690 --> 02:21:12,159
I don't know where that guy came from.

1818
02:21:12,159 --> 02:21:14,959
Who's running?

1819
02:21:17,379 --> 02:21:18,340
Whose shadow is that?

1820
02:21:20,129 --> 02:21:20,290
Wait.

1821
02:21:20,290 --> 02:21:21,409
Are they almost in the room?

1822
02:21:21,409 --> 02:21:21,969
They're almost in the room.

1823
02:21:21,969 --> 02:21:24,500
They're almost in the room.

1824
02:21:24,500 --> 02:21:25,299
Oh, my God.

1825
02:21:29,670 --> 02:21:29,989
Help me.

1826
02:21:29,989 --> 02:21:30,229
Help me.

1827
02:21:30,229 --> 02:21:30,469
Help me.

1828
02:21:30,469 --> 02:21:30,950
I'm coming.

1829
02:21:30,950 --> 02:21:31,750
I'm here.

1830
02:21:31,750 --> 02:21:43,809
How do I?

1831
02:21:43,809 --> 02:21:43,969
Okay.

1832
02:21:43,969 --> 02:21:44,610
There we go.

1833
02:21:44,610 --> 02:21:45,489
I can get them on the ground.

1834
02:21:45,489 --> 02:21:45,969
Free time.

1835
02:21:45,969 --> 02:21:46,530
Nice.

1836
02:21:46,530 --> 02:21:50,659
Next wave.

1837
02:21:52,959 --> 02:21:54,790
Should I do health or defense?

1838
02:21:54,790 --> 02:21:55,510
Let's do defense.

1839
02:21:56,069 --> 02:22:01,299
Don't get hit.

1840
02:22:01,299 --> 02:22:01,780
Awesome.

1841
02:22:09,909 --> 02:22:11,670
Defense equals health.

1842
02:22:12,739 --> 02:22:13,299
Five head.

1843
02:22:16,770 --> 02:22:17,409
Task completed.

1844
02:22:17,409 --> 02:22:17,649
All right.

1845
02:22:17,649 --> 02:22:18,290
Where is it out here?

1846
02:22:18,930 --> 02:22:22,760
Say hello to delinquent.

1847
02:22:23,319 --> 02:22:25,840
Lovely day, isn't it?

1848
02:22:30,899 --> 02:22:31,459
I...

1849
02:22:31,459 --> 02:22:31,860
Yeah.

1850
02:22:31,860 --> 02:22:32,260
All right.

1851
02:22:32,899 --> 02:22:34,069
What do I do?

1852
02:22:42,340 --> 02:22:42,739
God.

1853
02:22:44,180 --> 02:22:45,059
Can I do this?

1854
02:22:45,860 --> 02:22:49,540
I can't.

1855
02:22:50,340 --> 02:22:56,850
I'm getting so many materials.

1856
02:22:56,850 --> 02:22:57,809
Holy shit.

1857
02:22:57,809 --> 02:22:58,610
Give me all of it.

1858
02:22:59,250 --> 02:23:05,170
How do you sprint?

1859
02:23:07,010 --> 02:23:07,649
They're in his room.

1860
02:23:07,649 --> 02:23:08,209
They're in his room.

1861
02:23:08,209 --> 02:23:08,610
I gotta go.

1862
02:23:13,879 --> 02:23:14,200
I got it.

1863
02:23:14,200 --> 02:23:14,520
I got it.

1864
02:23:14,520 --> 02:23:14,920
I got it.

1865
02:23:14,920 --> 02:23:15,159
I'm fine.

1866
02:23:15,159 --> 02:23:15,559
I'm fine.

1867
02:23:15,559 --> 02:23:15,799
I'm fine.

1868
02:23:15,799 --> 02:23:19,079
I'm fine.

1869
02:23:19,079 --> 02:23:19,479
Stop.

1870
02:23:20,120 --> 02:23:38,850
Okay.

1871
02:23:40,290 --> 02:23:41,250
Can you make any more?

1872
02:23:41,250 --> 02:23:41,889
Don't do that.

1873
02:23:47,120 --> 02:23:47,360
Dude.

1874
02:23:48,079 --> 02:23:49,969
What is this guy doing?

1875
02:23:50,770 --> 02:23:55,250
You learned pile driver.

1876
02:23:55,250 --> 02:23:57,170
Grab an enemy jump and then press X.

1877
02:23:57,729 --> 02:23:59,750
All right.

1878
02:23:59,750 --> 02:24:00,149
Free time.

1879
02:24:00,149 --> 02:24:02,790
I need you to make health.

1880
02:24:02,790 --> 02:24:10,709
I want to go explore the world though.

1881
02:24:14,500 --> 02:24:15,459
Interact with the clock.

1882
02:24:17,350 --> 02:24:19,110
Oh, you can have the next wave come immediately.

1883
02:24:19,110 --> 02:24:19,909
Hold on.

1884
02:24:19,909 --> 02:24:25,620
What is this?

1885
02:24:26,420 --> 02:24:34,309
What do I do that for?

1886
02:24:34,309 --> 02:24:43,350
Does that mean it's all the way over here?

1887
02:24:43,350 --> 02:24:44,389
Where's this health?

1888
02:24:44,389 --> 02:24:51,159
That's a huge...

1889
02:24:51,159 --> 02:24:51,479
Uh-oh.

1890
02:24:52,370 --> 02:24:52,930
Oh, no.

1891
02:24:52,930 --> 02:24:53,649
I might...

1892
02:24:53,649 --> 02:24:54,209
No, I'm good.

1893
02:24:54,930 --> 02:24:55,569
Where's the health?

1894
02:25:04,770 --> 02:25:05,569
That was...

1895
02:25:06,370 --> 02:25:07,319
All right.

1896
02:25:07,319 --> 02:25:08,440
This game is fucking great.

1897
02:25:08,440 --> 02:25:09,479
I don't care what anybody says.

1898
02:25:10,659 --> 02:25:11,299
Why did it...

1899
02:25:11,299 --> 02:25:12,340
Where is my health?

1900
02:25:31,809 --> 02:25:34,450
You learned stamp, stamp.

1901
02:25:34,450 --> 02:25:36,290
In front of a lying enemy, it's down, down.

1902
02:25:36,290 --> 02:25:40,549
Give me that.

1903
02:25:40,549 --> 02:25:41,510
Down, down.

1904
02:25:41,510 --> 02:26:00,370
What's that sound?

1905
02:26:00,930 --> 02:26:01,430
All right.

1906
02:26:01,430 --> 02:26:03,829
Make a defense coding.

1907
02:26:03,829 --> 02:26:14,159
Something else I can do back here.

1908
02:26:14,159 --> 02:26:16,120
Did I actually just ruin everything?

1909
02:26:16,120 --> 02:26:23,299
But wait, what can I do about this?

1910
02:26:23,940 --> 02:26:27,750
Oh, all right.

1911
02:26:27,750 --> 02:26:28,549
Make a...

1912
02:26:28,549 --> 02:26:29,350
Make another one of those.

1913
02:26:34,049 --> 02:26:35,170
Build an extra room.

1914
02:26:37,440 --> 02:26:41,889
Kitchen, bathroom, living room, living room.

1915
02:26:47,010 --> 02:26:48,209
And then a bathroom.

1916
02:26:48,209 --> 02:26:50,659
And then a bathroom.

1917
02:26:50,659 --> 02:26:55,430
All right.

1918
02:26:55,430 --> 02:26:55,829
We're good.

1919
02:26:55,829 --> 02:27:19,909
Does the damage increase depending on how high you go?

1920
02:27:19,909 --> 02:27:22,579
They're in the room.

1921
02:27:26,239 --> 02:27:26,879
How do I do the move?

1922
02:27:27,600 --> 02:27:28,629
I got to get over there.

1923
02:27:30,739 --> 02:27:30,979
Go!

1924
02:27:36,159 --> 02:27:36,879
Get over there!

1925
02:27:37,520 --> 02:27:47,989
This dude's embedded into the wall.

1926
02:27:53,000 --> 02:28:05,809
Jump, dive kick, back downstairs.

1927
02:28:05,809 --> 02:28:07,729
Can you make some more items, please?

1928
02:28:07,729 --> 02:28:31,829
What's that?

1929
02:28:31,829 --> 02:28:37,510
What's in your head?

1930
02:28:37,510 --> 02:28:38,469
Yeah, what is that?

1931
02:28:38,469 --> 02:28:46,600
Short of resources?

1932
02:28:47,719 --> 02:28:48,760
Oh, I need crystals.

1933
02:28:48,760 --> 02:28:50,200
Where do I get resources?

1934
02:28:50,200 --> 02:28:59,239
I did it.

1935
02:28:59,239 --> 02:29:05,590
Sundown.

1936
02:29:05,590 --> 02:29:08,469
They are coming.

1937
02:29:08,469 --> 02:29:13,459
I think I have to break stuff on either side, right?

1938
02:29:13,459 --> 02:29:15,299
That scared the shit out of me.

1939
02:29:15,299 --> 02:29:23,760
Get up.

1940
02:29:23,760 --> 02:29:39,620
All right.

1941
02:29:39,620 --> 02:29:41,940
This move was good, but not really because it takes too much time.

1942
02:29:41,940 --> 02:29:49,120
The animation takes too long.

1943
02:29:49,120 --> 02:29:50,799
It's not DPS efficient.

1944
02:29:50,799 --> 02:30:08,129
I need health.

1945
02:30:08,129 --> 02:30:09,090
Really bad.

1946
02:30:09,090 --> 02:30:20,600
I'm all right.

1947
02:30:20,600 --> 02:30:26,280
I have two lives, I think.

1948
02:30:26,280 --> 02:30:27,780
Okay.

1949
02:30:27,780 --> 02:30:33,010
Actually, let me take the health and then I want to go break this stuff over here to

1950
02:30:33,010 --> 02:30:36,770
get materials, right?

1951
02:30:36,770 --> 02:30:37,809
That makes sense, doesn't it?

1952
02:30:39,120 --> 02:30:40,239
There's nothing else over here, right?

1953
02:30:54,479 --> 02:30:56,000
I didn't finish the one on the other side.

1954
02:30:56,639 --> 02:30:58,709
That was a mistake.

1955
02:31:10,129 --> 02:31:11,010
These guys are the worst.

1956
02:31:19,920 --> 02:31:33,559
There's so many people on this other side.

1957
02:31:33,559 --> 02:31:34,600
It's ridiculous.

1958
02:31:43,040 --> 02:31:46,920
What is this?

1959
02:31:47,909 --> 02:31:51,620
A booby pie?

1960
02:31:51,620 --> 02:31:52,340
What did I just do?

1961
02:31:57,780 --> 02:31:59,940
Oh, it automatically attacks.

1962
02:31:59,940 --> 02:32:10,180
Does it heal?

1963
02:32:10,180 --> 02:32:11,379
Help me soon.

1964
02:32:11,379 --> 02:32:14,790
Did they actually get in?

1965
02:32:22,520 --> 02:32:30,930
Damage.

1966
02:32:30,930 --> 02:32:31,569
Yes.

1967
02:32:31,569 --> 02:32:31,969
Okay.

1968
02:32:31,969 --> 02:32:33,989
It's not ready yet.

1969
02:32:33,989 --> 02:32:36,680
It's not ready yet.

1970
02:32:36,680 --> 02:32:36,920
All right.

1971
02:32:36,920 --> 02:32:38,600
I need to make some defense here.

1972
02:32:38,600 --> 02:32:47,860
How do I do it?

1973
02:32:47,860 --> 02:32:48,739
Body pillow?

1974
02:32:49,219 --> 02:32:52,629
Toothpaste tube.

1975
02:32:52,629 --> 02:32:54,840
What is body pillow?

1976
02:32:54,840 --> 02:32:59,760
What the fuck is this for?

1977
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:10,399
Ultra glove.

1978
02:33:10,399 --> 02:33:19,010
Wait, can I put it on?

1979
02:33:19,010 --> 02:33:20,799
Oh my God.

1980
02:33:20,799 --> 02:33:21,040
Okay.

1981
02:33:21,040 --> 02:33:22,079
Hold on a second.

1982
02:33:22,079 --> 02:33:23,750
Where are they coming from?

1983
02:33:29,219 --> 02:33:29,860
I see them.

1984
02:33:30,500 --> 02:33:32,739
I see you pieces of shit.

1985
02:33:32,739 --> 02:33:37,360
Handle this.

1986
02:33:37,360 --> 02:33:48,239
I have to look down.

1987
02:34:00,979 --> 02:34:02,739
What the fuck just happened?

1988
02:34:02,739 --> 02:34:06,159
I'm dead.

1989
02:34:13,590 --> 02:34:15,190
How do I get back there?

1990
02:34:15,190 --> 02:34:21,889
Okay.

1991
02:34:21,889 --> 02:34:24,209
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1992
02:34:24,209 --> 02:34:34,020
Are they killing them?

1993
02:34:34,020 --> 02:34:52,319
They're going to get in.

1994
02:34:52,319 --> 02:34:59,219
I got to pile drive this guy out of the sky box.

1995
02:34:59,219 --> 02:35:05,829
One more.

1996
02:35:07,639 --> 02:35:20,610
What's going on?

1997
02:35:20,610 --> 02:35:33,639
Is there a train coming?

1998
02:35:33,639 --> 02:35:35,000
Why is there a train coming?

1999
02:35:47,729 --> 02:35:49,569
Citroen grill?

2000
02:35:49,569 --> 02:35:51,010
I need resources.

2001
02:35:51,010 --> 02:36:11,030
Okay.

2002
02:36:11,030 --> 02:36:16,530
This is hurting my eyes.

2003
02:36:16,530 --> 02:36:17,329
Get out.

2004
02:36:17,329 --> 02:36:18,290
I need a pile driver.

2005
02:36:22,319 --> 02:36:35,030
Can we do demos all night in sorcery tomorrow?

2006
02:36:35,030 --> 02:36:38,120
I, you know, I would say yes,

2007
02:36:38,120 --> 02:36:43,190
but the council of sorcery

2008
02:36:43,190 --> 02:36:49,620
would be very, very upset with me if I said yes.

2009
02:36:49,620 --> 02:36:51,379
Time field collapse detected.

2010
02:36:51,379 --> 02:36:59,409
High energy phenomenon is approaching to us.

2011
02:36:59,409 --> 02:37:02,450
If we are waiting here, our neighbors might be harmed badly.

2012
02:37:02,450 --> 02:37:04,440
Let's counter him on the way.

2013
02:37:10,239 --> 02:37:10,799
Jesus.

2014
02:37:11,360 --> 02:37:18,629
All right.

2015
02:37:18,629 --> 02:37:19,670
It's too red.

2016
02:37:20,309 --> 02:37:21,190
All right.

2017
02:37:21,190 --> 02:37:21,989
This is loud.

2018
02:37:30,260 --> 02:37:30,819
Get in there.

2019
02:37:31,459 --> 02:37:39,360
Give me that.

2020
02:37:39,360 --> 02:37:40,239
Where is it?

2021
02:37:40,239 --> 02:37:40,479
What?

2022
02:37:41,510 --> 02:37:42,069
Pick it up.

2023
02:37:42,790 --> 02:37:47,139
Give me that.

2024
02:37:47,139 --> 02:37:47,379
All right.

2025
02:37:47,379 --> 02:37:48,260
I got it.

2026
02:37:48,260 --> 02:37:54,840
That just killed me.

2027
02:37:54,840 --> 02:38:02,049
Let's get a virtual boy on.

2028
02:38:02,049 --> 02:38:02,850
Yeah.

2029
02:38:02,850 --> 02:38:14,719
All right.

2030
02:38:14,719 --> 02:38:16,079
Just, just bully.

2031
02:38:16,079 --> 02:38:18,500
Don't, do not let him even do anything.

2032
02:38:19,909 --> 02:38:20,790
Just chain grab.

2033
02:38:20,790 --> 02:38:21,510
Be obnoxious.

2034
02:38:22,229 --> 02:38:39,280
All right.

2035
02:38:39,280 --> 02:38:39,520
Got him.

2036
02:38:39,520 --> 02:38:39,760
Got him.

2037
02:38:39,760 --> 02:38:50,239
I got him.

2038
02:38:50,239 --> 02:38:51,760
Hey, thank you for playing.

2039
02:38:51,760 --> 02:38:59,360
So that was, that was called pole stay.

2040
02:38:59,360 --> 02:39:01,010
The name of that one.

2041
02:39:01,010 --> 02:39:05,489
That was a wild ride.

2042
02:39:05,489 --> 02:39:06,049
Pole stay.

2043
02:39:13,350 --> 02:39:13,590
All right.

2044
02:39:13,590 --> 02:39:13,989
Next one.

2045
02:39:16,879 --> 02:39:17,680
That one was quick.

2046
02:39:17,680 --> 02:39:18,719
That was snappy.

2047
02:39:18,719 --> 02:39:28,000
I don't know when that one comes on.

2048
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,479
How about pizza possum?

2049
02:39:30,479 --> 02:39:32,149
That was pretty pog to me.

2050
02:39:32,149 --> 02:39:47,299
Let's try pizza possum.

2051
02:39:47,299 --> 02:39:51,379
And it's, it's going to be bright when I press this button.

2052
02:39:51,379 --> 02:39:52,819
Just to give you a warning.

2053
02:39:52,819 --> 02:39:53,620
Very bright.

2054
02:39:53,620 --> 02:39:58,229
You ready?

2055
02:39:58,229 --> 02:40:01,329
Pizza possum.

2056
02:40:01,329 --> 02:40:02,290
Let's go.

2057
02:40:02,290 --> 02:40:04,559
Okay.

2058
02:40:04,559 --> 02:40:05,360
You eat food.

2059
02:40:11,350 --> 02:40:12,950
Oh, I have to eat food and then I get a key.

2060
02:40:12,950 --> 02:40:14,149
Do I have to not get spotted?

2061
02:40:14,790 --> 02:40:19,649
That was pizza possum.

2062
02:40:19,649 --> 02:40:20,610
That was fun.

2063
02:40:20,610 --> 02:40:27,190
Okay.

2064
02:40:27,190 --> 02:40:29,559
You have to eat and not get spotted.

2065
02:40:29,559 --> 02:40:29,879
I get it.

2066
02:40:32,040 --> 02:40:33,079
Oh, shit.

2067
02:40:33,079 --> 02:40:33,559
Can you jump?

2068
02:40:41,940 --> 02:40:42,340
Shit.

2069
02:40:42,340 --> 02:40:42,899
All right.

2070
02:40:42,899 --> 02:40:43,459
This is fun.

2071
02:40:43,459 --> 02:40:43,860
Hold on.

2072
02:40:43,860 --> 02:40:53,200
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2073
02:40:53,200 --> 02:40:56,319
So if I press, I can eat the food if I press a button.

2074
02:40:56,319 --> 02:40:56,879
No, I can't.

2075
02:40:56,879 --> 02:40:57,360
All right.

2076
02:40:57,360 --> 02:40:58,399
I guess let's slow down.

2077
02:41:11,680 --> 02:41:12,239
Got it.

2078
02:41:12,239 --> 02:41:24,659
How long can I do this for?

2079
02:41:24,659 --> 02:41:25,459
Oh, you can hide.

2080
02:41:31,479 --> 02:41:32,360
Now I want a pizza.

2081
02:41:35,520 --> 02:41:35,920
Wait a minute.

2082
02:41:35,920 --> 02:41:36,479
I'm too fat.

2083
02:41:37,600 --> 02:41:41,430
I think if you eat too much, you get big.

2084
02:41:42,069 --> 02:41:50,899
How come I'm eating so many of them?

2085
02:41:50,899 --> 02:41:55,799
Wait, nobody's hostile here.

2086
02:42:00,959 --> 02:42:02,079
Drop all your tomatoes.

2087
02:42:11,270 --> 02:42:12,469
I think things respawn too.

2088
02:42:18,899 --> 02:42:19,219
All right.

2089
02:42:19,219 --> 02:42:19,940
I can't.

2090
02:42:19,940 --> 02:42:20,579
Wait.

2091
02:42:20,579 --> 02:42:20,899
Okay.

2092
02:42:21,459 --> 02:42:21,940
Checkpoint.

2093
02:42:25,879 --> 02:42:26,360
This is the...

2094
02:42:26,360 --> 02:42:26,840
Wait a minute.

2095
02:42:27,399 --> 02:42:28,600
It might be a problem here.

2096
02:42:28,600 --> 02:42:29,219
Excuse me.

2097
02:42:29,219 --> 02:42:31,379
This is the sorcery enjoyers high council.

2098
02:42:31,379 --> 02:42:38,479
We would allow you to play the game tomorrow if you promise to play at least for four or more hours.

2099
02:42:38,479 --> 02:42:41,520
If this is not met, know that flanker is already on standby.

2100
02:42:41,840 --> 02:42:45,750
There is a curse placed upon you that will go into effect as well.

2101
02:42:45,750 --> 02:42:46,469
Hmm.

2102
02:42:46,469 --> 02:42:49,159
No, we'll do it today.

2103
02:42:49,159 --> 02:43:00,450
Energy drink for a quick boost.

2104
02:43:00,450 --> 02:43:04,610
So if there's no jump, how would I...

2105
02:43:04,610 --> 02:43:11,120
I'm just kind of a nuisance.

2106
02:43:14,709 --> 02:43:14,870
Okay.

2107
02:43:14,870 --> 02:43:16,790
So the dogs are security guards.

2108
02:43:17,350 --> 02:43:21,569
Holy shit.

2109
02:43:21,569 --> 02:43:22,370
There's a lot of ice cream.

2110
02:43:24,159 --> 02:43:24,399
No.

2111
02:43:25,360 --> 02:43:25,680
All right.

2112
02:43:25,680 --> 02:43:26,000
All right.

2113
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:26,239
All right.

2114
02:43:26,239 --> 02:43:29,280
All right.

2115
02:43:29,280 --> 02:43:30,559
Dogs love chasing bones.

2116
02:43:31,280 --> 02:43:34,069
This game is very cute.

2117
02:43:34,069 --> 02:43:34,469
I like it.

2118
02:43:35,030 --> 02:43:36,709
Try one more time.

2119
02:43:36,709 --> 02:43:45,750
Just outrun the dog and you're good.

2120
02:43:46,309 --> 02:43:48,450
Can you turn around?

2121
02:43:49,090 --> 02:43:50,399
What game is this?

2122
02:43:50,399 --> 02:43:52,000
This game is called pizza possum.

2123
02:43:57,319 --> 02:43:57,879
Get that bone.

2124
02:43:58,520 --> 02:44:15,959
Give me all the ice cream.

2125
02:44:15,959 --> 02:44:16,280
All right.

2126
02:44:16,280 --> 02:44:17,000
I almost have enough.

2127
02:44:17,989 --> 02:44:18,709
Zeppola?

2128
02:44:22,180 --> 02:44:24,260
He's going to start sorcery and then he's going to end the stream.

2129
02:44:25,829 --> 02:44:36,069
No, that's not going to happen.

2130
02:44:36,069 --> 02:44:36,309
All right.

2131
02:44:36,309 --> 02:44:39,270
So it's about getting the best route because everything respawns.

2132
02:44:39,270 --> 02:44:42,549
So you're really going to just kind of go fast and eat, eat, eat, eat, and then open the door.

2133
02:44:43,190 --> 02:44:52,180
No, we're going to play sorcery.

2134
02:44:52,180 --> 02:44:53,059
Don't worry.

2135
02:44:53,059 --> 02:44:56,579
We're going to play sorcery for at least two to three hours.

2136
02:44:56,579 --> 02:44:57,540
At least.

2137
02:44:57,540 --> 02:44:57,780
Okay.

2138
02:45:00,440 --> 02:45:01,239
Don't worry.

2139
02:45:01,239 --> 02:45:04,020
I got you.

2140
02:45:04,020 --> 02:45:04,500
I got you.

2141
02:45:16,600 --> 02:45:17,639
Council is displeased.

2142
02:45:17,639 --> 02:45:24,629
We'll just wait till the council here is flanker talk again for the first time in like a year.

2143
02:45:37,680 --> 02:45:38,239
Hmm.

2144
02:45:38,239 --> 02:45:39,540
I think it's going to go.

2145
02:45:39,540 --> 02:45:39,780
Go.

2146
02:45:40,420 --> 02:45:44,180
All right.

2147
02:45:44,180 --> 02:45:48,020
If you do too much too quick, you that's what slows you down.

2148
02:45:48,020 --> 02:45:48,659
I get it.

2149
02:45:48,659 --> 02:46:03,760
I like the soundtrack plays kind of while you're doing things.

2150
02:46:05,969 --> 02:46:06,770
Turn around.

2151
02:46:06,770 --> 02:46:25,059
Ah, I got a key.

2152
02:46:25,059 --> 02:46:27,989
I got a key.

2153
02:46:27,989 --> 02:46:30,229
Wait, that was illegal.

2154
02:46:30,950 --> 02:46:32,610
All right.

2155
02:46:33,920 --> 02:46:34,399
One more time.

2156
02:46:34,399 --> 02:46:35,200
One more time.

2157
02:46:35,200 --> 02:46:35,680
And I'm done.

2158
02:46:36,239 --> 02:46:52,180
I'm going to throw a bone.

2159
02:46:52,180 --> 02:46:57,750
How long does the bone last?

2160
02:46:59,200 --> 02:47:00,079
Not that long.

2161
02:47:00,719 --> 02:47:01,510
Okay.

2162
02:47:01,510 --> 02:47:02,389
And I'm not going to screw up.

2163
02:47:10,290 --> 02:47:10,930
All right.

2164
02:47:10,930 --> 02:47:26,600
All right.

2165
02:47:26,600 --> 02:47:27,559
We're almost there.

2166
02:47:27,559 --> 02:47:32,399
Give me.

2167
02:47:32,399 --> 02:47:35,760
All right.

2168
02:47:35,760 --> 02:47:38,690
I can open this door.

2169
02:47:38,690 --> 02:47:48,530
Looks so real.

2170
02:47:48,530 --> 02:47:49,569
Dogs won't be able to tell the difference.

2171
02:47:49,569 --> 02:47:50,770
It's a dog mask.

2172
02:47:50,770 --> 02:47:57,879
Oh, I'm going to put it on and run right through.

2173
02:48:03,440 --> 02:48:04,159
That's silly.

2174
02:48:05,280 --> 02:48:06,079
This is silly.

2175
02:48:16,520 --> 02:48:16,840
Okay.

2176
02:48:17,639 --> 02:48:20,979
I'm going down.

2177
02:48:21,620 --> 02:48:23,620
So you slowly unlock the level.

2178
02:48:23,620 --> 02:48:32,520
This is silly.

2179
02:48:33,079 --> 02:48:38,450
Look at that over there.

2180
02:48:38,450 --> 02:48:40,129
Look at that huge feast over there.

2181
02:48:40,129 --> 02:48:48,159
This is going to be insane.

2182
02:48:48,719 --> 02:48:59,200
All right.

2183
02:48:59,200 --> 02:48:59,520
Hide.

2184
02:49:08,520 --> 02:49:09,719
I need the whole thing.

2185
02:49:09,719 --> 02:49:12,479
I think I got it all.

2186
02:49:13,360 --> 02:49:14,799
It's awesome.

2187
02:49:14,799 --> 02:49:15,440
Thank you.

2188
02:49:15,440 --> 02:49:17,120
Hungry wish list.

2189
02:49:18,340 --> 02:49:20,200
Oh, okay.

2190
02:49:20,200 --> 02:49:20,920
It was timed.

2191
02:49:27,639 --> 02:49:28,360
I liked it.

2192
02:49:28,360 --> 02:49:29,000
That was cute.

2193
02:49:31,479 --> 02:49:32,040
I liked it.

2194
02:49:32,680 --> 02:49:38,440
You know, this is a game that I could see myself

2195
02:49:38,440 --> 02:49:42,180
just kind of relaxing in bed and playing it.

2196
02:49:42,180 --> 02:49:43,809
I liked it.

2197
02:49:45,729 --> 02:49:46,610
Nice job.

2198
02:49:46,610 --> 02:49:50,420
All right.

2199
02:49:50,420 --> 02:49:51,139
We're going to do.

2200
02:49:51,139 --> 02:49:54,049
This is another kind of more chilled out relaxing one.

2201
02:49:54,049 --> 02:49:56,370
This is called Station to Station.

2202
02:49:56,370 --> 02:50:07,729
Looks like you build a train station.

2203
02:50:08,129 --> 02:50:15,239
I know.

2204
02:50:15,239 --> 02:50:28,520
I think this is not a controller game.

2205
02:50:29,399 --> 02:50:30,610
You guys ready to chill out?

2206
02:50:31,170 --> 02:50:36,159
Level one.

2207
02:50:36,159 --> 02:50:41,350
You can play Poly Bridge.

2208
02:50:41,989 --> 02:50:42,850
I've heard of it.

2209
02:50:42,850 --> 02:50:43,250
I've seen it.

2210
02:50:43,889 --> 02:50:45,090
Okay.

2211
02:50:45,090 --> 02:50:46,530
Complete all 12 buildings.

2212
02:50:51,569 --> 02:50:52,530
W A S D.

2213
02:50:54,549 --> 02:50:55,190
Click.

2214
02:50:55,190 --> 02:50:59,139
Click.

2215
02:50:59,139 --> 02:51:01,090
Zoom.

2216
02:51:01,090 --> 02:51:01,489
Zoom.

2217
02:51:02,739 --> 02:51:03,620
Hover over the building.

2218
02:51:03,620 --> 02:51:04,260
See what it does.

2219
02:51:05,649 --> 02:51:06,290
Wheat farm.

2220
02:51:07,540 --> 02:51:09,379
Buildings need to be connected to a station.

2221
02:51:09,379 --> 02:51:14,049
Press space bar or the station button to play stations.

2222
02:51:14,049 --> 02:51:15,809
Rotate the station with the scroll wheel.

2223
02:51:15,809 --> 02:51:16,049
Okay.

2224
02:51:16,610 --> 02:51:23,159
So what I want kind of put it like right here.

2225
02:51:26,719 --> 02:51:27,360
Start moving.

2226
02:51:32,959 --> 02:51:33,600
All right.

2227
02:51:33,600 --> 02:51:46,639
What does it want it?

2228
02:51:46,639 --> 02:51:48,319
The mill requires wheat.

2229
02:51:48,319 --> 02:52:00,440
Click on the station connector to build a railroad.

2230
02:52:00,440 --> 02:52:00,940
Oh.

2231
02:52:04,690 --> 02:52:05,190
Oh.

2232
02:52:13,520 --> 02:52:14,239
Ooh.

2233
02:52:14,239 --> 02:52:16,239
And it makes the world look pretty.

2234
02:52:20,899 --> 02:52:22,549
All right.

2235
02:52:22,549 --> 02:52:23,270
You got money.

2236
02:52:23,270 --> 02:52:25,270
Receiving money also unlocks new buildings.

2237
02:52:25,270 --> 02:52:34,440
Hover over the building again to see what it has completed.

2238
02:52:34,440 --> 02:52:37,239
Each wheat farm can supply only one mill.

2239
02:52:37,239 --> 02:52:41,159
So the new wheat farm needs to be connected to a different mill than the one you already used.

2240
02:52:41,159 --> 02:52:43,379
Okay.

2241
02:52:44,020 --> 02:52:57,430
All right.

2242
02:52:57,430 --> 02:52:57,829
Let's go.

2243
02:52:58,389 --> 02:52:59,940
Check this.

2244
02:53:00,739 --> 02:53:06,340
Check it out.

2245
02:53:06,340 --> 02:53:18,309
Wait did it mean oh I needed to connect these two.

2246
02:53:19,459 --> 02:53:20,819
Uh it's fine.

2247
02:53:20,819 --> 02:53:51,120
I'm just seeing what you could do.

2248
02:53:51,120 --> 02:53:52,479
Waste of government funds.

2249
02:53:53,200 --> 02:54:01,059
I did it for fun.

2250
02:54:01,860 --> 02:54:03,059
What are you talking about?

2251
02:54:03,059 --> 02:54:17,190
Start building from this station.

2252
02:54:17,190 --> 02:54:17,829
Okay.

2253
02:54:17,829 --> 02:54:20,149
Tricky terrain ahead.

2254
02:54:20,149 --> 02:54:23,319
Click the highlighted area.

2255
02:54:23,319 --> 02:54:25,280
Yep.

2256
02:54:25,280 --> 02:54:33,940
Not that tricky.

2257
02:54:33,940 --> 02:54:40,530
Please somebody saying please develop this for the switch.

2258
02:54:40,530 --> 02:54:47,270
Yeah this has huge potential to be just fun to make railroads.

2259
02:54:47,270 --> 02:54:47,909
All right.

2260
02:54:47,909 --> 02:54:49,840
The building.

2261
02:54:49,840 --> 02:54:56,870
Check the supply and demand of the new building.

2262
02:54:56,870 --> 02:54:59,010
Needs produces.

2263
02:54:59,010 --> 02:55:00,370
It produces milk.

2264
02:55:00,370 --> 02:55:01,559
What does it need though?

2265
02:55:01,559 --> 02:55:03,860
Nothing.

2266
02:55:03,860 --> 02:55:07,139
This needs milk.

2267
02:55:07,139 --> 02:55:08,739
This needs milk.

2268
02:55:08,739 --> 02:55:09,940
The cheesery.

2269
02:55:09,940 --> 02:55:10,500
Okay.

2270
02:55:10,500 --> 02:55:12,260
So this produces milk.

2271
02:55:12,260 --> 02:55:13,540
This needs milk.

2272
02:55:13,540 --> 02:55:15,700
So let's go for this.

2273
02:55:15,700 --> 02:55:16,420
Ready?

2274
02:55:16,420 --> 02:55:18,069
Is this gonna work?

2275
02:55:18,069 --> 02:55:42,819
So this needs milk.

2276
02:55:42,819 --> 02:56:00,790
Got it.

2277
02:56:00,790 --> 02:56:03,360
Oh shit it just got way harder.

2278
02:56:03,360 --> 02:56:08,399
Buildings can be indirectly connected instead of directly connecting this cheeseery to the

2279
02:56:08,399 --> 02:56:10,479
dairy farm on the other side of the map.

2280
02:56:10,479 --> 02:56:13,520
Or I connected them both to a nearby station on the network.

2281
02:56:13,520 --> 02:56:38,120
Does this count?

2282
02:56:38,120 --> 02:56:39,680
Like can I go like this?

2283
02:56:39,680 --> 02:57:03,600
Does that count?

2284
02:57:03,600 --> 02:57:06,000
Like can I stop here and then go?

2285
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:06,879
Yeah it works.

2286
02:57:06,879 --> 02:57:07,840
I mean you can do it.

2287
02:57:07,840 --> 02:57:12,069
You can do it.

2288
02:57:12,069 --> 02:57:12,549
Stop.

2289
02:57:14,950 --> 02:57:16,309
I don't even know how the game works.

2290
02:57:16,309 --> 02:57:18,309
I'm just it's literally tutorial.

2291
02:57:19,040 --> 02:57:20,319
Mobile game ad.

2292
02:57:20,319 --> 02:57:21,440
Mobile game ad.

2293
02:57:21,440 --> 02:57:24,069
It's the tutorial.

2294
02:57:24,069 --> 02:57:28,549
It is gonna be a mobile game ad when you're in the tutorial for the game.

2295
02:57:28,549 --> 02:57:45,889
Look at that.

2296
02:57:45,889 --> 02:57:46,450
Cool.

2297
02:57:46,450 --> 02:57:46,690
All right.

2298
02:57:46,690 --> 02:57:47,809
Let's do the next level.

2299
02:57:47,809 --> 02:57:49,090
I like this one a lot.

2300
02:57:49,090 --> 02:58:00,879
Look at that.

2301
02:58:00,879 --> 02:58:02,450
Next level.

2302
02:58:02,450 --> 02:58:02,850
Let's go.

2303
02:58:02,850 --> 02:58:03,010
All right.

2304
02:58:03,010 --> 02:58:04,129
I get it now and it's gonna be fun.

2305
02:58:04,129 --> 02:58:19,079
That's the goal.

2306
02:58:19,079 --> 02:58:19,639
Cheap rails.

2307
02:58:19,639 --> 02:58:23,010
The rails cost half the regular price.

2308
02:58:23,010 --> 02:58:24,530
Bridge price is unchanged.

2309
02:58:31,350 --> 02:58:32,629
I don't think I want to do this right now.

2310
02:58:33,360 --> 02:58:33,520
All right.

2311
02:58:33,520 --> 02:58:35,280
What's the goal?

2312
02:58:35,280 --> 02:58:37,649
I need milk.

2313
02:58:37,649 --> 02:58:39,329
So I got milk milk.

2314
02:58:39,329 --> 02:58:39,569
All right.

2315
02:58:39,569 --> 02:58:40,930
We got two cheeseries.

2316
02:58:40,930 --> 02:58:43,110
Is that what they're called?

2317
02:58:43,110 --> 02:58:49,059
So we got double cheese.

2318
02:58:52,450 --> 02:58:57,729
I'm gonna put this one here in case I need to go bridge up this way.

2319
02:58:57,729 --> 02:58:58,930
So let's go like this.

2320
02:59:00,920 --> 02:59:02,120
Aim it like that.

2321
02:59:02,120 --> 02:59:05,059
Like that.

2322
02:59:05,059 --> 02:59:05,299
Okay.

2323
02:59:05,940 --> 02:59:08,340
So then we need a connection from here to here.

2324
02:59:08,340 --> 02:59:12,440
And then a connection from here to here.

2325
02:59:13,239 --> 02:59:15,399
Let's make it smooth and not like shit.

2326
02:59:15,959 --> 02:59:23,750
I might have to come down here with the other track.

2327
02:59:24,389 --> 02:59:32,159
Here we go.

2328
02:59:32,159 --> 02:59:32,799
Done.

2329
02:59:32,799 --> 02:59:35,719
Give us some new stuff.

2330
02:59:35,719 --> 02:59:39,909
New cards.

2331
02:59:39,909 --> 02:59:41,110
I click to draw cards.

2332
02:59:41,829 --> 02:59:43,969
You get a hand.

2333
02:59:44,530 --> 02:59:51,510
When are you gonna play Fortnite creative mode?

2334
02:59:52,629 --> 02:59:59,010
The only time I've ever played Fortnite for real was during the tournament that Ludwig did.

2335
02:59:59,569 --> 03:00:02,049
And then I said I'll never play it ever again after that.

2336
03:00:02,049 --> 03:00:02,690
Ever.

2337
03:00:02,690 --> 03:00:09,760
Yeah.

2338
03:00:09,760 --> 03:00:10,559
I saw the clip.

2339
03:00:10,559 --> 03:00:15,520
I saw the clip of Myth and Ludwig just laughing their asses off at my game flight.

2340
03:00:15,520 --> 03:00:17,920
They got like 60 million views, by the way.

2341
03:00:17,920 --> 03:00:21,809
I can never return to that game.

2342
03:00:25,329 --> 03:00:29,329
All right.

2343
03:00:29,329 --> 03:00:29,809
What is this?

2344
03:00:31,889 --> 03:00:32,370
Flour.

2345
03:00:33,299 --> 03:00:34,020
This makes bread.

2346
03:00:34,020 --> 03:00:34,739
So I need flour.

2347
03:00:34,739 --> 03:00:36,340
Where's the flour production facility?

2348
03:00:36,979 --> 03:00:39,239
This makes flour.

2349
03:00:39,879 --> 03:00:42,790
So starting here.

2350
03:00:42,790 --> 03:00:46,000
I'm gonna go up bridge mode this way.

2351
03:00:46,639 --> 03:00:48,520
Because this needs wheat.

2352
03:00:49,239 --> 03:00:50,840
So we need to go this way.

2353
03:00:51,559 --> 03:00:51,959
Bridge.

2354
03:00:52,600 --> 03:00:53,159
Expensive.

2355
03:00:53,159 --> 03:00:54,680
But, you know, I think it's worth it.

2356
03:00:55,239 --> 03:00:57,079
And then that could connect to here.

2357
03:00:57,799 --> 03:01:00,600
Because then the flour can come back through here and make the bread.

2358
03:01:00,600 --> 03:01:01,459
What are you?

2359
03:01:01,459 --> 03:01:01,700
Dumb?

2360
03:01:11,680 --> 03:01:12,719
All right.

2361
03:01:12,719 --> 03:01:17,190
Now we need to go from producers wheat to flour.

2362
03:01:24,420 --> 03:01:24,979
Looks good.

2363
03:01:25,940 --> 03:01:27,299
And then we come back this way.

2364
03:01:29,489 --> 03:01:29,729
Right?

2365
03:01:30,530 --> 03:01:34,420
Through here.

2366
03:01:37,559 --> 03:01:37,959
Bingo.

2367
03:01:38,600 --> 03:01:52,760
And then press tab or hover over the complete level button to highlight.

2368
03:01:53,399 --> 03:01:54,040
Wait, what is it?

2369
03:01:54,040 --> 03:01:54,600
Highlight.

2370
03:01:54,600 --> 03:01:55,719
Oh, incomplete buildings.

2371
03:01:56,280 --> 03:01:59,250
Wait, what's wrong here?

2372
03:02:01,110 --> 03:02:02,469
Oh, this is making cheese.

2373
03:02:04,069 --> 03:02:06,469
This is probably like a cheese steak factory or something, right?

2374
03:02:07,200 --> 03:02:07,440
All right.

2375
03:02:07,440 --> 03:02:08,319
They want cheese.

2376
03:02:08,319 --> 03:02:24,659
They want everything.

2377
03:02:24,659 --> 03:02:25,219
Okay.

2378
03:02:25,219 --> 03:02:28,659
So the city needs bread, milk, and cheese.

2379
03:02:28,659 --> 03:02:30,709
The bread is here.

2380
03:02:30,709 --> 03:02:33,799
So this is making bread.

2381
03:02:33,799 --> 03:02:35,559
I'm going to have it come back this way.

2382
03:02:35,559 --> 03:02:36,440
Let's just double it up.

2383
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:41,620
This is going to connect.

2384
03:02:42,180 --> 03:02:42,819
Double it up.

2385
03:02:44,069 --> 03:02:51,889
No, this is getting bread.

2386
03:02:54,959 --> 03:02:55,760
So this is making.

2387
03:02:55,760 --> 03:02:56,639
We need to make milk.

2388
03:02:59,889 --> 03:03:04,340
Double it up.

2389
03:03:04,340 --> 03:03:06,260
Does anybody need more milk?

2390
03:03:06,260 --> 03:03:07,540
I mean, they do.

2391
03:03:08,180 --> 03:03:09,299
I don't think anybody else needs it.

2392
03:03:10,760 --> 03:03:12,200
No other like cheese building.

2393
03:03:12,840 --> 03:03:15,860
This one's pretty easy.

2394
03:03:19,909 --> 03:03:22,610
Wait, how do I get the cheese over here?

2395
03:03:23,170 --> 03:03:24,959
Oh, like this.

2396
03:03:24,959 --> 03:03:35,360
I didn't even spend any of these yet.

2397
03:03:35,360 --> 03:03:38,360
What about city skylines too?

2398
03:03:38,360 --> 03:03:45,540
Oh, you better believe it.

2399
03:03:45,540 --> 03:03:47,780
He is not going to play sorcery.

2400
03:03:47,780 --> 03:03:48,579
Yes, I am.

2401
03:03:48,579 --> 03:03:49,889
What time is it?

2402
03:03:49,889 --> 03:04:01,639
Oh, shit.

2403
03:04:01,639 --> 03:04:02,770
Okay.

2404
03:04:02,770 --> 03:04:11,299
This needs everything.

2405
03:04:11,299 --> 03:04:12,340
Milk can come up here.

2406
03:04:12,340 --> 03:04:12,579
All right.

2407
03:04:12,579 --> 03:04:14,020
We're going to do cheap bridges.

2408
03:04:14,020 --> 03:04:18,799
How do I activate it?

2409
03:04:18,799 --> 03:04:36,950
Do I even wait?

2410
03:04:36,950 --> 03:04:41,280
Milk coming up here.

2411
03:04:41,280 --> 03:04:42,370
Cheap bridges.

2412
03:04:42,370 --> 03:04:43,969
Yeah, I want a cheap bridge.

2413
03:04:43,969 --> 03:04:48,239
Look at that.

2414
03:04:48,239 --> 03:04:52,239
Cheese is going up here.

2415
03:04:52,239 --> 03:04:53,120
Milk heading this way.

2416
03:04:53,120 --> 03:04:53,520
Cheese.

2417
03:04:53,520 --> 03:04:57,360
And now I need to make bread connection.

2418
03:04:57,360 --> 03:05:01,399
Bakery is making bread.

2419
03:05:01,399 --> 03:05:10,850
Cheap bridges.

2420
03:05:10,850 --> 03:05:11,409
Oh, shit.

2421
03:05:11,409 --> 03:05:11,889
Wait.

2422
03:05:11,889 --> 03:05:22,850
Well, it looks nicer.

2423
03:05:22,850 --> 03:05:23,329
It's fine.

2424
03:05:23,329 --> 03:05:24,950
I mean, lies of J.

2425
03:05:24,950 --> 03:05:25,430
Lies of J.

2426
03:05:25,430 --> 03:05:26,149
What do you mean?

2427
03:05:26,149 --> 03:05:28,959
I'm going to play sorcery.

2428
03:05:28,959 --> 03:05:30,639
I'm still having fun in the demos.

2429
03:05:30,639 --> 03:05:32,739
I've been live for three hours.

2430
03:05:32,739 --> 03:05:33,379
It's not.

2431
03:05:33,379 --> 03:05:33,940
It's not.

2432
03:05:33,940 --> 03:05:35,700
I've been having my life for like eight hours.

2433
03:05:35,700 --> 03:05:57,829
This still needs bread.

2434
03:05:57,829 --> 03:06:00,319
Wait.

2435
03:06:00,319 --> 03:06:01,840
Oh, I have to go here.

2436
03:06:01,840 --> 03:06:02,399
Okay.

2437
03:06:02,399 --> 03:06:21,799
I don't need money.

2438
03:06:21,799 --> 03:06:28,209
I did it.

2439
03:06:28,209 --> 03:06:28,530
Yeah.

2440
03:06:29,170 --> 03:06:42,020
I almost had it.

2441
03:06:42,020 --> 03:06:42,579
All right.

2442
03:06:42,579 --> 03:06:47,350
Let's do another one.

2443
03:06:47,350 --> 03:06:52,020
This was called station to say station.

2444
03:06:52,020 --> 03:06:55,969
Station to station.

2445
03:06:55,969 --> 03:06:57,090
I liked it.

2446
03:06:57,090 --> 03:07:00,309
Let's do another one.

2447
03:07:00,309 --> 03:07:07,909
How about legendary hoplite?

2448
03:07:07,909 --> 03:07:11,430
And then we'll move to sorcery after this.

2449
03:07:11,430 --> 03:07:25,010
Play viewfinder.

2450
03:07:25,010 --> 03:07:26,370
I actually have that one up here too.

2451
03:07:26,370 --> 03:07:33,059
That was a good one.

2452
03:07:33,059 --> 03:07:39,520
All right.

2453
03:07:39,520 --> 03:07:41,360
Viewfinder or legendary hoplite?

2454
03:07:41,360 --> 03:07:43,989
Which one?

2455
03:07:43,989 --> 03:07:44,790
Viewfinder.

2456
03:07:44,790 --> 03:07:50,899
Try viewfinder.

2457
03:07:50,899 --> 03:08:07,360
Graphics.

2458
03:08:07,360 --> 03:08:11,700
Okay.

2459
03:08:14,079 --> 03:08:16,370
A little bit.

2460
03:08:16,370 --> 03:08:29,600
Start demo.

2461
03:08:29,600 --> 03:08:30,399
Great.

2462
03:08:30,399 --> 03:08:31,569
We're in.

2463
03:08:31,569 --> 03:08:32,930
Time to explore.

2464
03:08:32,930 --> 03:08:34,229
Okay.

2465
03:08:34,229 --> 03:08:34,790
Wait.

2466
03:08:34,790 --> 03:08:42,129
Way too high.

2467
03:08:42,129 --> 03:08:42,850
Time to explore.

2468
03:08:42,850 --> 03:08:43,569
What we got?

2469
03:08:43,569 --> 03:08:44,770
Coffee can.

2470
03:08:44,770 --> 03:09:00,799
It's a very pretty game.

2471
03:09:00,799 --> 03:09:01,440
Coding.

2472
03:09:01,440 --> 03:09:04,840
There's no time to talk like the present.

2473
03:09:04,840 --> 03:09:06,129
You can build anything.

2474
03:09:06,129 --> 03:09:07,649
Yet you start to build a lab.

2475
03:09:08,959 --> 03:09:12,239
I'm afraid the butter flavor is a work in progress.

2476
03:09:12,239 --> 03:09:17,670
We're coding pillows to watch the footage popcorn next.

2477
03:09:17,670 --> 03:09:21,270
To think all the wonders of the world can be doubled with

2478
03:09:21,270 --> 03:09:23,829
as long as you build the right space.

2479
03:09:24,709 --> 03:09:27,670
Whether Hiraya wants to admit it or not,

2480
03:09:27,670 --> 03:09:30,149
Mirren is truly brilliant.

2481
03:09:30,870 --> 03:09:32,629
Now how do I get out of here?

2482
03:09:32,790 --> 03:09:33,290
Hmm.

2483
03:09:35,430 --> 03:09:36,709
What is this place?

2484
03:09:37,430 --> 03:09:37,930
Ooh.

2485
03:09:38,549 --> 03:09:41,670
I've never seen this much overgrowth before.

2486
03:09:42,629 --> 03:09:43,129
It's...

2487
03:09:44,389 --> 03:09:44,889
Sky!

2488
03:09:45,350 --> 03:09:46,309
Whoa, you okay?

2489
03:09:47,829 --> 03:09:49,190
Uh, your vials look good.

2490
03:09:50,639 --> 03:09:53,760
I guess we know now that falling doesn't hurt.

2491
03:09:54,639 --> 03:09:56,079
That's some good news at least.

2492
03:10:07,540 --> 03:10:09,780
There must be a way to get back up there.

2493
03:10:09,780 --> 03:10:10,280
What?

2494
03:10:14,440 --> 03:10:16,040
I took way too long.

2495
03:10:16,040 --> 03:10:17,000
Did I run out of time?

2496
03:10:18,290 --> 03:10:19,409
You're what? That's sick!

2497
03:10:34,200 --> 03:10:35,959
I didn't want to do the whole demo again.

2498
03:10:43,860 --> 03:10:47,459
To think all the wonders of the world can be doubled with

2499
03:10:47,459 --> 03:10:50,180
as long as you build the right space.

2500
03:10:50,180 --> 03:10:50,680
Okay.

2501
03:10:50,899 --> 03:10:53,540
Whether Hiraya wants to admit it or not,

2502
03:10:53,540 --> 03:10:54,979
Mirren is truly brilliant.

2503
03:10:54,979 --> 03:10:55,479
I'm fine.

2504
03:11:00,079 --> 03:11:01,360
What's an old photograph doing here?

2505
03:11:01,360 --> 03:11:03,120
Do not double tap R.

2506
03:11:04,000 --> 03:11:05,860
I'm telling you, it takes you to the very beginning.

2507
03:11:10,739 --> 03:11:12,020
What the fuck just happened?

2508
03:11:12,020 --> 03:11:13,540
Whoa, okay, that's kind of cool.

2509
03:11:15,170 --> 03:11:18,450
Did, hang on, did you just shift reality?

2510
03:11:19,170 --> 03:11:20,870
A teleporter!

2511
03:11:21,590 --> 03:11:26,549
Glad you made it in one piece.

2512
03:11:28,159 --> 03:11:30,879
Hmm, interesting.

2513
03:11:57,969 --> 03:11:58,770
Gonna power it!

2514
03:12:01,569 --> 03:12:02,450
How do I power this?

2515
03:12:07,409 --> 03:12:09,809
Is this technically traditional?

2516
03:12:09,809 --> 03:12:10,530
It's two batteries.

2517
03:12:10,530 --> 03:12:12,370
Have you charged one?

2518
03:12:12,370 --> 03:12:13,409
Enough questions.

2519
03:12:13,409 --> 03:12:14,450
Stop moving.

2520
03:12:14,450 --> 03:12:14,950
Smile.

2521
03:12:15,809 --> 03:12:26,549
That was pretty cool.

2522
03:12:28,100 --> 03:12:29,700
I thought outside the box big time.

2523
03:12:41,110 --> 03:12:42,309
It's almost working.

2524
03:12:43,030 --> 03:12:44,389
Looks like we need one more.

2525
03:12:45,190 --> 03:12:48,290
Yeah, just hold the thing upside down.

2526
03:12:48,290 --> 03:12:49,569
Just let all the shit fall out.

2527
03:12:53,909 --> 03:13:03,329
I wasn't smart, it was just lazy.

2528
03:13:05,760 --> 03:13:06,399
I feel like it's...

2529
03:13:21,780 --> 03:13:24,100
Oh shit, maybe that was not a good idea.

2530
03:13:24,819 --> 03:13:37,090
What direction am I falling?

2531
03:13:51,680 --> 03:13:53,040
This is really, really neat.

2532
03:13:57,680 --> 03:13:59,120
Uh, looks fine like that.

2533
03:14:07,510 --> 03:14:08,389
Just one?

2534
03:14:08,389 --> 03:14:10,930
I should just put it upside down.

2535
03:14:10,930 --> 03:14:14,639
How do they even do this?

2536
03:14:16,819 --> 03:14:23,350
There is a, there's a coder who probably has spent a very long time

2537
03:14:23,350 --> 03:14:24,950
tediously making this possible.

2538
03:14:25,670 --> 03:14:42,760
They just made that up.

2539
03:14:43,319 --> 03:14:45,590
Made it up.

2540
03:14:48,709 --> 03:14:50,770
Wait, it wants me to make a bridge.

2541
03:14:57,030 --> 03:14:59,329
I was just curious what happened.

2542
03:15:04,530 --> 03:15:05,409
Made it up.

2543
03:15:05,409 --> 03:15:09,219
Close enough.

2544
03:15:09,219 --> 03:15:17,879
Uh, there's some programmer right now that's sitting there saying

2545
03:15:17,879 --> 03:15:23,559
you chat motherfuckers have no idea how difficult this was to do.

2546
03:15:35,030 --> 03:15:35,909
Actually, cool.

2547
03:15:35,909 --> 03:15:45,860
Okay.

2548
03:15:45,860 --> 03:15:46,420
Chill, bro.

2549
03:15:48,500 --> 03:15:49,219
Well, I'm...

2550
03:15:49,219 --> 03:15:49,780
That's what I would be saying.

2551
03:15:49,780 --> 03:15:51,540
Maybe there's a surface you can use to climb up there.

2552
03:15:58,690 --> 03:16:01,959
I need, I need to understand.

2553
03:16:01,959 --> 03:16:03,319
Climb the surface?

2554
03:16:03,319 --> 03:16:04,600
Beautiful as it is.

2555
03:16:04,600 --> 03:16:05,159
Whoa.

2556
03:16:05,159 --> 03:16:07,079
Carries so much weight.

2557
03:16:07,959 --> 03:16:09,559
There is promise here.

2558
03:16:09,639 --> 03:16:13,000
Promise of a future we can surely achieve.

2559
03:16:13,799 --> 03:16:18,200
Even now, I'm striving to reach heights I never thought possible.

2560
03:16:19,239 --> 03:16:23,719
All that I hope is that, that everything we do here continues...

2561
03:16:23,719 --> 03:16:25,479
Ah, it shows you where the other ones are too.

2562
03:16:25,479 --> 03:16:26,600
...up there as well.

2563
03:16:26,600 --> 03:16:27,780
For our sake.

2564
03:16:28,500 --> 03:16:29,540
For Miren's sake.

2565
03:16:30,180 --> 03:16:32,450
Climb this?

2566
03:16:32,450 --> 03:16:33,329
Wait, I'm confused.

2567
03:16:34,209 --> 03:16:43,319
There we go.

2568
03:16:43,319 --> 03:16:54,450
Is this game out?

2569
03:16:55,090 --> 03:16:56,149
When does this one come out?

2570
03:16:56,149 --> 03:16:56,950
Because this one's really fun.

2571
03:17:04,079 --> 03:17:04,559
July?

2572
03:17:05,200 --> 03:17:06,639
Three weeks?

2573
03:17:07,120 --> 03:17:08,159
Okay, remind me to play this.

2574
03:17:28,260 --> 03:17:28,899
What's happening?

2575
03:17:33,000 --> 03:17:48,000
All right, I need to go back.

2576
03:17:48,000 --> 03:17:49,360
How do I get back to where I was?

2577
03:17:49,360 --> 03:18:01,079
Oh, shit.

2578
03:18:02,040 --> 03:18:18,950
I'm back.

2579
03:18:18,950 --> 03:18:19,430
I'm fine.

2580
03:18:20,069 --> 03:18:22,180
But your nose...

2581
03:18:23,379 --> 03:18:24,559
I'm bleeding nose.

2582
03:18:24,559 --> 03:18:25,120
News bleeding.

2583
03:18:26,469 --> 03:18:26,950
I'm fine.

2584
03:18:26,950 --> 03:18:27,350
I'm fine.

2585
03:18:45,030 --> 03:18:45,670
Oh, hold on.

2586
03:18:45,670 --> 03:18:48,149
Let me put my middle finger up and put it under my nose.

2587
03:18:49,430 --> 03:18:49,989
My god.

2588
03:18:50,469 --> 03:18:54,360
This is a way better way to reveal that.

2589
03:18:54,920 --> 03:18:56,040
Have the blood come out of their eyes.

2590
03:18:56,600 --> 03:18:58,870
Nobody does that though.

2591
03:18:58,870 --> 03:19:22,020
Plus two, that changed my mind.

2592
03:19:22,020 --> 03:19:22,520
Good.

2593
03:19:22,899 --> 03:19:26,520
This one's a little different.

2594
03:19:51,000 --> 03:19:52,120
Can I actually go into this one?

2595
03:19:52,920 --> 03:20:02,600
Sorry, the edible hit right when I saw this one.

2596
03:20:10,149 --> 03:20:11,670
That's pretty magical though, I'll say.

2597
03:20:20,469 --> 03:20:20,969
What?

2598
03:20:23,350 --> 03:20:27,739
Cool.

2599
03:20:45,030 --> 03:20:50,840
I like how each one has a backdrop.

2600
03:20:51,399 --> 03:20:56,979
It's a nice touch.

2601
03:20:57,700 --> 03:20:59,590
Can I go in?

2602
03:21:00,389 --> 03:21:06,610
Like a dungeon?

2603
03:21:30,309 --> 03:21:31,670
My mouth is open.

2604
03:21:31,670 --> 03:21:32,950
I just want to make sure you know that.

2605
03:21:46,360 --> 03:21:46,860
Cool.

2606
03:21:47,799 --> 03:21:49,110
Did I miss a picture?

2607
03:21:49,829 --> 03:21:52,489
Wait.

2608
03:22:06,850 --> 03:22:07,350
Ah.

2609
03:22:07,969 --> 03:22:10,069
All right, let's fuck this whole thing up.

2610
03:22:14,579 --> 03:22:15,540
That wasn't gonna...

2611
03:22:16,180 --> 03:22:16,680
Okay.

2612
03:22:28,520 --> 03:22:29,020
Shit.

2613
03:22:37,459 --> 03:22:38,100
Hey, good one.

2614
03:22:38,659 --> 03:22:39,969
It was all right.

2615
03:22:43,729 --> 03:22:44,690
Wait, the demo's over?

2616
03:22:47,780 --> 03:22:48,659
Take a photo?

2617
03:22:49,219 --> 03:22:51,860
I gotta get this lined up.

2618
03:22:58,840 --> 03:23:00,440
That's how you take a photo right there.

2619
03:23:00,440 --> 03:23:02,680
That's how you take a pristine photo.

2620
03:23:03,319 --> 03:23:03,819
All right.

2621
03:23:12,680 --> 03:23:13,719
This is fucked.

2622
03:23:23,159 --> 03:23:23,659
Oh.

2623
03:23:23,959 --> 03:23:28,219
I'm all right.

2624
03:23:28,760 --> 03:23:55,190
All right, I gotta go all the way back.

2625
03:23:55,190 --> 03:23:56,549
I really like this one.

2626
03:23:56,549 --> 03:23:58,149
All right, this is a cool game.

2627
03:23:58,149 --> 03:23:59,989
I'm playing it on launch day.

2628
03:24:19,459 --> 03:24:21,059
You get five charges on the camera.

2629
03:24:21,700 --> 03:24:24,420
All right, so this is what they want me to do.

2630
03:24:24,420 --> 03:24:25,780
They want you to take a picture like this.

2631
03:24:27,139 --> 03:24:28,260
And then flip it around.

2632
03:24:28,979 --> 03:24:29,479
Like that.

2633
03:24:38,899 --> 03:24:39,700
Very nice.

2634
03:24:42,579 --> 03:24:43,079
Ah.

2635
03:24:44,020 --> 03:24:44,659
I get it.

2636
03:24:46,719 --> 03:24:48,159
And then I gotta go over here.

2637
03:24:48,959 --> 03:25:00,950
Some of these are gonna get way too big brained for me.

2638
03:25:00,950 --> 03:25:03,170
But it's cool nonetheless.

2639
03:25:03,729 --> 03:25:11,440
All right, so let's go.

2640
03:25:12,239 --> 03:25:18,079
Upside down strat works pretty well here.

2641
03:25:18,639 --> 03:25:35,639
How many do I need?

2642
03:25:35,639 --> 03:25:46,950
Probably three?

2643
03:25:46,950 --> 03:25:47,450
Let's see.

2644
03:25:47,909 --> 03:25:54,500
I might need a screwdriver.

2645
03:25:54,500 --> 03:26:06,629
Hey dude, we need...

2646
03:26:06,629 --> 03:26:07,270
Oh, it's only two.

2647
03:26:07,270 --> 03:26:07,770
Okay.

2648
03:26:18,200 --> 03:26:19,000
Oh, wait a minute.

2649
03:26:19,000 --> 03:26:19,959
Go back and spin it.

2650
03:26:19,959 --> 03:26:21,479
Wait, can I flip it around?

2651
03:26:21,479 --> 03:26:25,959
Wait, hold on.

2652
03:26:25,959 --> 03:26:29,969
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2653
03:26:29,969 --> 03:26:31,010
What if I go like this?

2654
03:26:31,010 --> 03:26:36,600
Does this fucking do anything?

2655
03:26:36,600 --> 03:26:38,680
It does.

2656
03:26:38,680 --> 03:26:40,360
All right, it does, it does, it does.

2657
03:26:40,360 --> 03:26:41,239
We're good now.

2658
03:26:41,239 --> 03:26:47,250
Is that an account?

2659
03:26:48,680 --> 03:27:06,399
Oh, wait.

2660
03:27:06,399 --> 03:27:07,520
Oh, it's over.

2661
03:27:11,139 --> 03:27:14,319
Oh, it's over.

2662
03:27:14,319 --> 03:27:21,829
Yeah, I'm playing this day one.

2663
03:27:21,829 --> 03:27:22,770
This is great.

2664
03:27:23,329 --> 03:27:29,459
That might be the highlight of the whole day so far.

2665
03:27:30,100 --> 03:27:31,379
And they've all been good.

2666
03:27:31,379 --> 03:27:35,780
I've enjoyed each one of them.

2667
03:27:35,780 --> 03:27:39,250
All right, I think it's time to take a break.

2668
03:27:39,250 --> 03:27:40,450
Come back, play some Sorcery.

2669
03:27:42,100 --> 03:27:43,620
Those of you that don't know what Sorcery is,

2670
03:27:44,920 --> 03:27:46,440
we have a lot of catching up to do.

2671
03:27:46,440 --> 03:27:48,920
I'm going to do my best to spend 10 seconds telling you what it is.

2672
03:27:49,559 --> 03:27:53,270
I'll do some more NexFest.

2673
03:27:53,270 --> 03:27:55,110
Well, wait, when is it done?

2674
03:27:55,110 --> 03:27:56,239
When's it done, done?

2675
03:27:56,239 --> 03:28:04,870
A couple of days, right?

2676
03:28:04,870 --> 03:28:12,280
Oh, because I want to play Final Fantasy 16 and just kind of hang out.

2677
03:28:12,280 --> 03:28:18,100
Maybe we'll shoot for Monday?

2678
03:28:18,100 --> 03:28:22,899
Is it over Monday or is it Monday all day and over technically on the 27th?

2679
03:28:22,899 --> 03:28:30,389
Yeah, we'll do Sorcery now.

2680
03:28:30,389 --> 03:28:34,690
Excited for House Flipper 2.

2681
03:28:35,010 --> 03:28:46,920
I'm going to lower the volume so it's not horrible.
