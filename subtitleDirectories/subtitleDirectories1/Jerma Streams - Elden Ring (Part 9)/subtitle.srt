1
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:14,519
Oh, hey, how are you? How's it going? How have you been? It's been a little while since we've

2
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:32,070
last seen each other's faces. I'm here. Good. Well, relatively good. Relatively good. Did I,

3
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:42,840
did I just send a tweet and like reply to somebody? I hope not. Did I in my speed reply to somebody's,

4
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:50,329
like on my timeline to say that I was streaming? That'd be so fucked up. Ah, we're good.

5
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:55,240
Yes. Hello. You haven't seen me in over a week. There's a few reasons for that.

6
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:03,799
One, if you didn't catch the streamer awards, I was there. It was a really good time. I got to meet

7
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:08,549
and network Andy with a bunch of people. Some people that I have already met and already knew,

8
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:11,989
but some people I'd never met before and that was the first time I've ever really

9
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:25,079
said hello. It was a very, very good time. This is the guy that won two awards. Yeah, I, I get,

10
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:29,799
hey, you know what? I guess so. I guess that, I guess I am, I am that person, aren't I?

11
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:39,060
It's time to flex a little, okay? 2022, no more like humble. No, I'm, I'm putting on a fucking

12
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:53,959
muscle shirt and I'm flexing now. See what I'm talking about? I'm not, I'm not ready. I'm not

13
00:01:53,959 --> 00:02:02,579
ready yet. Hold on. No, in all seriousness, I, there's a really, really tough category in both

14
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:09,379
categories. I, it was a really great time. It was really fun to be there. Anybody could have won

15
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:16,979
those two categories. Seriously. And they're all cool people. I've met pretty much all of them

16
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:25,610
besides the ones that weren't there. You need to explain Peppa Pig. They handed out coloring books

17
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:34,789
so I started coloring. I didn't bring a Peppa Pig coloring book to the streamer awards. They

18
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:48,360
handed them out. Why am I good at public speaking? I don't, I don't know. Okay. You want to know how

19
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,930
to actually public speak. You just have to pretend that everybody in the audience is your friend

20
00:02:54,650 --> 00:03:00,439
and they're all there to let, you're just hanging out with your friends. That's one of the best ways

21
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:05,770
to do it. You just literally pretend that everybody in the audience is like, oh yeah, I'm talking to

22
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:12,250
like, I'm talking to Burger Boy. Yeah, he's just, it's all Burger Boys. It's just, it's just a

23
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:18,300
audience full of Burger Boy, which I would definitely not recommend. I would definitely,

24
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,949
I would probably not attend that event. I would, I would hope that event would be like streamed so

25
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:31,900
I could watch from a distance. I would not want to go to that event. But no, honest to God, I don't

26
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:37,669
know. I don't think I'm really that good at public speaking. Just have something that you think you

27
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:41,990
really want to say and just say it and be, and confidently say the things that you want to say,

28
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:49,639
I guess. I was kind of nervous. It was, it's kind of nerve wracking, you know, going up there and

29
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:56,069
it's just a sea of people that you know are, these people are, there's a lot of people in

30
00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:02,539
this audience right now and a lot of them are like big streamers and people from the press.

31
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:05,659
It's like, I don't want to like, I don't want to have like a booger come out of my nose and go into

32
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:13,259
my mouth in the middle of that like speech because then that's it. The second that astray booger goes

33
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:20,439
out into mouth and I go, it's like, okay, I gotta, it's time to quit. So like every time before you,

34
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:25,000
before public speaking is, I mean, maybe I'm a weirdo. Like I always like make sure there's

35
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,230
nothing in my nose. I always make sure my teeth, my like teeth are okay. There's no like, there's

36
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:36,790
no like boogers in my nose because I don't know, it's possible. Even if it's a 0.01% chance,

37
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,740
that will be your legacy. Eating a booger accidentally on camera during a speech.

38
00:04:43,379 --> 00:05:03,699
You're taking notes. What? No, I'm just fucking kidding. I'm like, God, relax. Thick nose,

39
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:08,500
Andy. I do that before coming on here too. You guys don't think that I make sure that I look

40
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:18,459
clean? Anyways, I've been so, so ready to play Elden Ring. You have no idea. I'm gonna tell you

41
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:25,779
just how accurate that statement is. Um, so I've been, last week I've had digestive problems.

42
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:30,899
Those of you that don't know, I got diagnosed with like colitis and then proctitis and they thought

43
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:35,860
it was Crohn's originally, right? Like I've, I've had IBD bullshit for the last like 15, 20 years

44
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:41,300
almost. Uh, I, I got a flare up. I don't know why. Sometimes every, maybe once every like,

45
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:46,439
maybe once twice a year it ends up happening. Stomach. Well, it's not really stomach. I don't

46
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:53,480
want to pretend like it's a stomach thing. Uh, I have problems with my digestive track. So, um,

47
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:59,720
how long are we going tonight? As long as I can without needing to run away. Uh, I think I should

48
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,600
be good. If I need to take a break somewhere in a few hours, uh, see I'll do what kind of like we

49
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:11,050
did last time, which is actually a pretty good idea. Uh, but I have also in the meantime,

50
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,959
because if you see where we are right now, I have not moved on this character.

51
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:23,829
I've probably played through Limgrave like eight times because I just want to play so bad. I've

52
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:31,209
seen, I have seen every last detail of Limgrave. Everyone. I could tell you if you open a book,

53
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:35,829
have you opened up just a naked map of Limgrave? Nothing there. I could tell you where every

54
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:39,670
grace is. I could tell you where every dungeon is. I could tell you where every, wherever every NPC

55
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:45,660
is. I just want to play so bad. So I was like, I don't want to see too much though, but uh,

56
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,230
I guess I'll make a new character and go through Limgrave again. And it's like, Jesus, man,

57
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:54,579
I'm just glad to see something that's not like the tree sentinel. You know what I mean? You need

58
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:58,649
to prove it. I don't have to prove anything. No, cause then like I'll miss something and people

59
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:04,730
will be mad. All right. Anyways, here's what we're doing. You remember this guy, baby rattle?

60
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:12,089
It's, it's the, it's, you need to play with me strong. I'm not going to play with me strong.

61
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:22,470
No, no audio. Fuck. There you go. How come the characters are furry? The characters.

62
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,670
No, it's a stick of furry statue mask. Fine. I'll give you that.

63
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:32,089
You promised me strong. I did not promise anything.

64
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:38,490
We laughed about a scenario where, because me strong is supposed to be just a naked guy with

65
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:44,709
a club. And I want to try to just put every single point in strength and get the huge club

66
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:50,040
and just be a caveman running around. And everyone was like, oh, that's really funny. And it's like,

67
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:55,899
well, what if you were inebriated? I guess that makes it funnier that I'm just this guy with no

68
00:07:55,899 --> 00:08:05,899
health and like 80 strength and try to kill the bosses in like four hits and die. Like a fucking

69
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:12,170
caveman just running around. That's like the thing that people need to be concerned about.

70
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:23,639
Oh, tarnished. It's just a naked guy with a club. All right. Hit the thing. Me mad. Yeah.

71
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:30,170
All right. So I have to remember kind of what, what I did last. And what I remember is I remember

72
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,129
I was in a, I was, I was, I was in a state of a little bit of delirious.

73
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:40,649
I remember you guys were like, it was like hour number 12 or something. And I was exhausted. And

74
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:45,690
I couldn't, I couldn't even like read and you guys are like, oh, keep going, keep going. And I was

75
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:51,049
like, all right, fine. I'll keep going. And I killed a boss. And then I, it was like, no,

76
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:56,259
keep running up the tree. And I like ran up the tree and I killed another boss. Well, I didn't.

77
00:08:56,259 --> 00:09:03,610
The mimic tier did. Then they nerfed it. So that's not happening anymore. Ludwig wants to play

78
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:12,230
Fortnite with you. We're doing a thing in a week or so. Hey, you want, you want to see my games

79
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:21,210
that I might be picking for this little event? I wonder what I might be. I'm wait, is Ludwig picking

80
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:33,860
Fortnite? That's not one of the games Ludwig is doing, right? It's not Fortnite. Oh God. Okay.

81
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:42,820
Well, I got, I got a few picks myself. Okay. So I, that'll be interesting though. All right. I need

82
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:48,899
to figure out it's, it's been a while. Okay. So my entire experience so far, the last like nine days

83
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:57,860
has been this area and maybe like a little bit of here, but I, I kind of like have a ton of time

84
00:09:58,419 --> 00:10:03,620
that I like, my hard drive got overwritten because I just, all I know is Limgrave.

85
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:11,509
Everything else got deleted. So I believe the last thing that I did, I killed Morgoth and then I like

86
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:17,450
turned the stream off. So let's just, let me just, let me just go here, right? Yeah. I couldn't get

87
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:22,820
into the urn tree. And then that lady sat down and she was like, Oh, we can get in there eventually.

88
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:28,820
I guess if you go here, right? Oh, wait, no, no, no. It was marked. Okay. So this is where I need to

89
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:39,049
go, but is that where I'm going to go? This is a Limgrave expert. I would say so, but this is where

90
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:47,769
I have to go. But is that where necessarily I'm going? What is this? The rolled route. I'm going

91
00:10:47,769 --> 00:10:52,250
to be very honest. There was a bunch of shit in this Capitol that I did not see and I really want

92
00:10:52,250 --> 00:11:04,490
to see it. I'm level 98. Oh, I'm almost, do I have any crunchies? Oh shit. I have this. Oh, wait,

93
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:12,570
I did just like fucking turn the stream off. Didn't I? I did. I didn't even go back to the,

94
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:22,970
to the round table. Okay. Go explore the Capitol. Yeah, I was going to go do that first.

95
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:29,850
This is also going to be a long one. And I'll tell you why, because I'm not sure if I'm going

96
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:35,379
to be able to scream tomorrow. The idea was to stream tomorrow, do like more Elden Ring,

97
00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:41,779
because I'm an Elden Ring streamer. It's the only thing I play. So, you know, you go to the

98
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:50,259
volcano. Okay. So I might, we might do a super stream today, at least like eight to 10 hours.

99
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:56,759
I want to play Elden Ring. You know what I mean? Like I don't, I am, my body is going to have to

100
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:03,049
backseat here. I want to play Elden Ring and I want to play it on stream. So if I have to diarrhea,

101
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:12,230
PMI. How did I just say that? It's been like nine days since I've streamed. I forgot. Like,

102
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:18,870
I can't say everything on stream. I forgot. Like sometimes I forget that like there's a camera on

103
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,909
me and there's like a bunch of people here. But you know what I mean? Like if I have to go and

104
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:27,190
get like a drink, if I have to like go like take a quick PRB, then I, then maybe I will, whatever.

105
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:47,179
Who cares? I'm going to be fine. What did he just say? It's you. Pay me any mind. It's not him.

106
00:12:47,179 --> 00:13:01,269
Just lay out your arms. Oh shit. Oh, we got something to talk about here. They buffed the

107
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:10,700
fuck out of Sorcery. Sorcery got a massive buff. Almost every spell. So if you don't know,

108
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:16,779
Patch 1.03 came out. They nerfed a few things. By the way, this, this is not one of the things

109
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:23,509
that they nerfed. I saw a lot of people that were very upset about this. Where is it? Where is it?

110
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:29,509
Come on. I know everyone's going to revile back when they see it on screen. They didn't nerf the

111
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:36,460
Moonveil. The Moonveil is still great, isn't it? They did nerf the Mimic tier and a few other things,

112
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:43,019
right? A few other like combos, spell combos or whatever. But Sorcery got a big buff. Almost

113
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:48,539
every spell got its mana reduced and some of its damage increased. So maybe we have to lean into

114
00:13:48,539 --> 00:14:00,470
Sorcery. They nerfed, wait, the Moonveil got a stealth nerf. Really? Really? What is it? What's

115
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:06,100
the stealth nerf? All right, let's, let's get into this. I don't want to overwhelm myself with a

116
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:11,460
bunch of like bullshit. Like I just, I'm using the baby rattle. I, I, I'm almost a plus 10 baby

117
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:18,179
rattle, which is max. I'm here for, whoa, that was a weird. All right. I'm definitely, we're

118
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:21,139
going to have to get the boys up because I definitely utilize them a little more.

119
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:31,529
Okay. Because if the Mimic tier is not going to be a thing anymore, if this got nerfed,

120
00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:36,090
which I put all of my shit into, and it's not that good anymore, then we're going to have,

121
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:44,820
we got a pivot here. We're going to have to get the boys up. The Mimic tier is still good.

122
00:14:44,820 --> 00:15:04,389
Well, it's a different currency, so it's fine. All right. So what's new? Oh yeah. This guy over

123
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:20,870
here. Oh yeah. That guy died. Sombra Miner's Bell Bearing. When did I get this? Oh, I can buy

124
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:27,669
somber smithing stones up to four. That's a big deal. And I can buy this, uh, gloveboard as well.

125
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:33,639
Very cool. All right. Let's, let's just go. Let's just go. Let's go. Mimic's still good.

126
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:44,120
Pleased to know that Radan was nerfed. What did they do to Radan? Oh, talk to the finger reader.

127
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:53,529
Yeah. Why did he look like he had his head hanging out of a car window in the wind? I don't know, dude.

128
00:15:54,090 --> 00:16:06,039
Okay.

129
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,100
The urge tree has spurned you.

130
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,980
They went into standby mode?

131
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:46,220
No matter for me, but you. How will you ever manage to wait?

132
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:54,070
You know what I never understand about these grand overarching video games and stuff? It's always

133
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:59,480
the most powerful deities, the most powerful beings, the most intelligent

134
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:06,460
god sage-like beings apparently don't fucking know that there's a door in front of the urge tree.

135
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:14,440
How can you fuck that? How do you fuck that up so badly? This all-knowing entity that

136
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:18,680
converses with the greater will doesn't know that there, there is a thing in front of the urge tree.

137
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:24,200
You think that you would have known that already like 10,000 years ago.

138
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:33,500
Oh, what a turn of events. I can't believe you can't get through the front door.

139
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,700
Let me spend 10,000 years up here trying to figure out how to get you in the front door.

140
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:47,509
I want to burn the, oh, that's right. This didn't, she sat down, right? And she's like,

141
00:17:47,509 --> 00:17:59,130
oh, I want to burn the tree or something. It's been a while. That's his magical sword.

142
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:13,990
Regal Omen Barn. That's it. Int and Faith. I... Int and Faith. B for both?

143
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:29,420
This sword is arcane and dex. I can't use it. I need an int. It's a CSGO knife. Yeah,

144
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:36,630
this is a usable item, but is it, how is it any good? I'm not getting the good scaling,

145
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:47,859
right? Because I don't have any faith. CSGO knife. I don't know. I don't think all the usable items

146
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:53,940
that are, I feel like they have some utility, but it's more of a look at this cool, okay.

147
00:18:53,940 --> 00:19:01,779
This is the kind of item that you do PVP with and you just use it to be different. And people go,

148
00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:06,019
whoa, wow, you're using, that's a cool thing to use. I mean, I'm going to R1 you four times

149
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:10,740
and you're dead, but that was cool what you did there. That was a nice, I know, but I haven't

150
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:18,009
seen anybody use that yet. So I, I'm just going to get the runes. This is really cool though.

151
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:28,170
This makes me want to make a like dex arcane character. I do that. Stop shitting on me.

152
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:34,380
I do it too. I'm just saying that we know what we're doing. I want to burn the impenetrable

153
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:55,829
thorn. Burn the tree. That's so fucking weird.

154
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:17,849
Would be unthinkable. This thing's just like stuck in standby mode. So why didn't you guys

155
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:32,500
figure this out before I got here? I've been walking around the whole world and not trying

156
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:53,109
to help you. I don't know who's good and who's evil in these games. Wait, we're talking,

157
00:20:53,829 --> 00:21:02,950
of course, this would be a toilet flush like in the background and then the fingers start moving.

158
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:07,640
I'm back from my 10,000 years of conversion with the greater will.

159
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:21,880
Okay. How do I burn it? You're a dog barking in the background, like a zoom call.

160
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:43,000
Okay. What am I? Like there are like 30 endings in this game. Okay. I couldn't get in the front

161
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:50,839
door. Fingers are pissed about it and I'm going to burn the tree down. I guess. So we're going to

162
00:21:50,839 --> 00:22:05,319
crush that thing. Interesting though. Okay. How many souls am I going to get for this? 100,000.

163
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:21,019
30. That guy was not very strong apparently. All right. Well, how's my character look?

164
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:29,140
Maybe more into mind endurance. I got 50 intelligence, 25 decks, 40 vigor.

165
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:44,490
I don't know. Endurance maybe. Maybe some more mana. I have 15 endurance omega low. Yeah. Yeah.

166
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:54,519
I mean, yeah, that's pretty bad. That's like really bad. Yeah. I mean, that's like really bad.

167
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:05,579
Okay. I am ready to move. I'm in a position where I think I'm good. I'm ready to move. All right.

168
00:23:05,579 --> 00:23:08,539
That took a little longer, but I needed to kind of figure out what the hell was going on and where

169
00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:13,339
I was. And when, I mean, the last time I played it was like 10 days ago, unless you're talking

170
00:23:13,339 --> 00:23:22,309
about limb grave. All right. I remember here, here, there was a place to go down and there

171
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:26,470
was a big dragon hand. And I remember saying to you guys, I want to do that when I come back.

172
00:23:27,269 --> 00:23:42,299
Here we are. All right. Let me head down here. I think this is where I need to be. No. Where is it?

173
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:54,700
I got to get this stuff burnt back into memory of like where I am. Is it not this one? Oh,

174
00:23:54,700 --> 00:24:00,579
this is right. Is it right? I thought it was. Oh my God. I thought that was a fucking enemy.

175
00:24:00,579 --> 00:24:07,430
I was like, why does I have to fight that thing? Uh, I think I'm gonna go down and see.

176
00:24:08,069 --> 00:24:12,230
It's really hard to navigate the Capitol. Um, I thought I kind of knew what I was doing,

177
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:28,390
but it's just been a while. I'll check down here. Oh shit. Wait. Okay. Hold on. I see an item over

178
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:36,009
there. Okay. I got, I got wicked bad glare on my screen right now. It's fucking me up.

179
00:24:47,029 --> 00:25:10,950
These guys suck. This is the best item. Everyone that we were talking a lot of shit about the

180
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:15,990
baby rattle, but it's very good. Are the awards on the shelf? They are not. I actually,

181
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:24,569
actually forgot them, but it's okay. You know, the Jake is on the case. I'm going to get them.

182
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:39,269
I know I, they, I had them and had them and then two or three cocktails later. I didn't.

183
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:51,269
Oh, that's right. I climbed up this shit. All right. Easy, easy, easy. So if I go,

184
00:25:51,269 --> 00:25:57,910
can I go down from here? And is this the right way? I don't think so. What about the other side?

185
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:10,220
Is this where I wanted to go? This is, it has to be right. I think that's where I needed to go.

186
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:14,460
Yeah. Cause there was a big arm on the ground and it was like cool looking. Okay. Let's go.

187
00:26:15,099 --> 00:26:37,099
I got this fucking glare on the screen. Is he supposed to be hiding? What the fuck? Should I

188
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:41,529
go down here? All right. I'm going down here. We're fighting this thing. I got this,

189
00:26:41,529 --> 00:26:47,180
I got this glare that I got to take care of. Give me one second. It's a, it's a goal. This

190
00:26:47,180 --> 00:27:13,240
room is glaring. I think that's, that's better. Yeah. Uh, there we go. Address losing the awards.

191
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:19,160
I didn't lose them. They just were put in a box and then I left the box and I forgot to take

192
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:24,200
the box. So we're good. We're good. Community Jake is on the case and he has confirmed that

193
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:33,029
I got him. We're good. We're good. We're fine. All right. Um, let's go. I fuck it. I'm going down.

194
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:42,200
Wait, you don't come down. Oh, that's not what I would. That's not what I anticipated.

195
00:27:42,759 --> 00:28:00,819
We're fine. Fine. You do melt them down. I wouldn't want to melt them down. They're

196
00:28:00,819 --> 00:28:05,829
not made out of a material that would be safe to do that. I feel like I wouldn't want to breathe

197
00:28:05,829 --> 00:28:11,109
the air in the room that I did that in. All right. Where's he at? Can he fire up here?

198
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:37,799
He can fire up here. All right. Whatever. Stop. Oh, they made comet better. I don't know why it

199
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:51,480
sounded like that. It sounded like a weird like talk show host, like a radio host. Why am I doing

200
00:28:51,480 --> 00:29:00,150
it like this by the way? Just go down there and fucking attack him. Go. I don't even man up.

201
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:10,230
All right. That was so simple. I don't know why I made that way too complicated.

202
00:29:15,609 --> 00:29:20,299
All right. So there's nothing down here. Maybe that block. He's blocking the path.

203
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:26,680
I don't know. Intriguing. Are you going to use the guide for the remaining quests?

204
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:36,220
No, I don't think so. Look, this game, this game is so unbelievably ridiculous that playing through

205
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:42,309
the game again, look, I have like four characters that are ready to get out of limb grip. Um, so

206
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:48,420
playing the game another two or three times and experiencing more stuff, I kind of want to leave

207
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:56,059
it. I kind of want to leave it. I'd like to experience more stuff with other characters.

208
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:08,099
Okay. So that's, I can't go there, but let's try over here. So people that are saying, oh dude,

209
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:11,460
you're going to go back and do like every single secret boss and secret thing and you're going to

210
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:20,779
go clear out. Probably not. No, I don't think so. I think that's fun to be able to experience it.

211
00:30:21,579 --> 00:30:24,900
Um, again, with another character and just do different stuff that I didn't do.

212
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:50,299
That's good. He hates Elden ring. I can go up here. I, there are noises coming from over here.

213
00:30:50,859 --> 00:31:17,180
I get to, wait, was I was already down here, wasn't I? Wasn't I already down here? There's

214
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:31,400
like a, one of those killers, the Omen killer people were here. Are you going to do a retch

215
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:37,849
playthrough? Uh, I don't know. Retch playthroughs are awesome, but you end up like hating the game

216
00:31:37,849 --> 00:31:42,650
in the first hour or two. And every time I've ever tried to do retch or whatever they call it

217
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:47,130
in the other games, I go, oh, this is awesome. And I get started base level 10 with everything.

218
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:52,009
That's perfect. And then I get, I start playing the game and I get killed in like two hits by

219
00:31:52,009 --> 00:31:56,809
something or I can't hurt something. And I go, this is stupid. Why did I ever do this? Like,

220
00:31:56,809 --> 00:31:59,849
what a dumb thing to do. Just pick one of the normal characters and I like flip out.

221
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:21,259
I didn't go down here. Isn't me strong a retch? Yeah, but that was only because I had to do me

222
00:32:21,259 --> 00:32:28,490
strong as a retch because they start with the club. That's a different scenario. All right,

223
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:41,690
let's go this way. Retch is enjoyable in this game. Is it? I don't think so. Fuck you.

224
00:32:42,809 --> 00:32:55,660
Poison bone dot. How come you don't know how to put a suit on? I know how to put. All right. First

225
00:32:55,660 --> 00:33:05,779
of all, I, okay. I know how to put it. I don't know. I know how to put a suit on. I just don't

226
00:33:05,779 --> 00:33:15,589
wear them that often and hate these enemies. I have not had a reason to put a suit on in a long

227
00:33:15,589 --> 00:33:56,569
time. Don't you understand? What? Why did that happen? No, no. Oh my God. I fucking,

228
00:33:56,569 --> 00:34:11,159
I actually hate this enemy. I'm out of fucking juice. Riding the guys in this hallway is so bad,

229
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:19,659
by the way. You can't go anywhere. And I need my lantern or like starlight or something. I can't,

230
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:35,510
I can't see anything. Yeah. I don't know. You, you hold on. Skin's coming out of my mouth.

231
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:52,869
I still haven't done anything with those either. No. Okay. Did I get the lantern? I feel like I

232
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:57,739
didn't buy it. And every time I don't buy it, you guys remind me to buy it. And I go,

233
00:34:57,739 --> 00:35:01,900
nah, it's all right, dude. I got fucking starlight and, and then I don't put it on.

234
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:10,380
And I'm just walking around in darkness. What's your favorite lunchable? The original,

235
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:16,940
I believe was ham, cheese and crackers. That's it. None of this. I don't, there's all this new

236
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:26,920
bullshit. Oh, like pizza in like a fucking tube or whatever the hell it is. No, excuse me. Ham,

237
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:31,320
cheese or turkey and cheese. The little circles, nothing else. Please don't give me any of that.

238
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:48,550
Oh, like tacos. What the fuck are you talking about? That's zoomer food. I mean, it's food

239
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:58,090
for kids. I don't know if it's necessarily zoomer food. Zoomer food. I mean, I ate that when I was

240
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:23,849
young and I'm not a zoomer. All right. I gotta get back there. What the fuck? Oh, I am so strong.

241
00:36:25,659 --> 00:36:28,460
Although I'm probably going to, that confidence is probably going to disappear very soon.

242
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:38,570
Oh, this is where he was. All right. So what, is there anything else down here?

243
00:36:41,219 --> 00:36:52,739
What else is down here? You're outleveled for this area. Yeah. But I did a lot of

244
00:36:52,739 --> 00:37:01,989
exploring early in the game. That's fine though. I don't care. Level 98, 99. All right. How do I

245
00:37:01,989 --> 00:37:21,480
get that? How do I get that item? Oh shit. Okay. So I don't think I can do anything else down here.

246
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:28,519
I'm just going to go up unless, did I build this? Yeah, I did. No, I didn't. Okay.

247
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:39,880
My thoughts on the game so far? It's, I, I don't need, I don't really don't even know what to say

248
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:44,820
anymore. It's not like nothing compares. Have you guys found it like funny? Okay. You know,

249
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:48,739
isn't there like still like 400 plus thousand concurrent players playing this game right now?

250
00:37:51,289 --> 00:37:57,449
I think like everybody's just been sort of waiting for a game like this for like a fucking decade.

251
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:03,829
Even Dark Souls three, right? Was like good. It was cool. That was fucking fun, but

252
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:11,110
Sekiro was good. It was fun. It was challenging. It was hard. I mean, I, I don't know. I feel like

253
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:21,719
I haven't played a game like this in a decade. Guilty hood? First hood to cloak of olive brown.

254
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:37,780
It doesn't really do anything. What does it look like? That's cool. I mean, I need, I want the,

255
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:48,090
what's the intelligence, right? Uh, I mean, the, the issue I think is that so many people have

256
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:53,530
been waiting for, I think what a lot of people can say, let me, let me say, I think, let me say,

257
00:38:53,530 --> 00:39:00,900
I think like 10 times more times in a row. So open world games have become sort of a form you,

258
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:11,940
form your Lamatic thing, right? I think this made the open world concept a lot cooler because

259
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:17,139
it's sort of, it's not the way that normal open world games play. You kind of just have to go

260
00:39:17,139 --> 00:39:22,730
explore. You have to go figure it out on your own. And something about that is, is so overwhelming,

261
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:29,139
but so welcoming at the same time, because nobody is telling me where I have to go. And it's like

262
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:33,940
terrifying because you'll accidentally walk into some places you might not, maybe it shouldn't be.

263
00:39:35,059 --> 00:39:41,860
And it's this horrifying, but equally like interesting experience where you kind of did

264
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:51,159
that to yourself. Even if you, it's not that different. Sorry. Sorry. I thought you, I thought

265
00:39:51,159 --> 00:40:00,090
you, I thought that we were on Reddit. I thought you replied to me on Reddit. I'm all right. I'm

266
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:12,599
okay. I did this. I remember this Reddit brain, but it, it, okay. It's not that different,

267
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:18,280
but everything feels like it's in its place. Okay. Everything feels like it was hand placed,

268
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:25,099
like everything does from the starter area to the later areas, to walking around, everything feels

269
00:40:25,099 --> 00:40:33,699
hand placed, handmade, like this was crafted in a fucking clay and everyone's saying breath of the

270
00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:37,699
wild. I haven't played breath of the wild yet. So let me experience that and I'll give you my,

271
00:40:37,699 --> 00:40:43,289
no, because then people are going to be pissed. All right. That was not, did I fucking miss

272
00:40:43,289 --> 00:40:57,880
anything down here? I think I cleared it. Play it, play it, play it. But what if I play breath of

273
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:04,119
the wild and I stream it and I'm sitting there as Mr. Streamer mode, trying to desperately say,

274
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:20,360
fuck, I don't like this. And then I'm going to have to be like, it's okay. It's pretty good.

275
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:25,369
I like it. And then they're going to go, he's lying. He hates it. And then I'm going to like,

276
00:41:25,369 --> 00:41:33,320
stop playing it in two days and I'm going to lose 50,000 fucking do it. That's what I'm scared of.

277
00:41:36,889 --> 00:41:48,300
Um, I probably would actually really like it. What's this? Do I have this? Oh shit. Is this

278
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:59,269
down or up? Do I have this? Oh fuck. It's just literally this. It's just, I could have climbed

279
00:41:59,269 --> 00:42:05,340
up there with my fingernails. Why do you think you'll hate it so much? I know I don't think,

280
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:15,429
I really don't think I will. I think I would probably love it a lot. All right. Um, I need

281
00:42:15,429 --> 00:42:21,829
to get to that area with the arm. I gotta go. It's been so, it's been too long. I gotta,

282
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:28,860
I don't remember. I gotta go like that. Where's the dragon? Dragon has like an arm on the ground,

283
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:38,219
but it has to be this way. It has to be up in that area over there by the boss, right? This

284
00:42:38,219 --> 00:42:52,280
dragon has an arm that's on the ground. I don't know where it is. Let me go over here. Let me go

285
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:57,400
backwards from here. It's just like, I can't remember. Where are you trying to go? I'm trying,

286
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:02,360
there was a place like kind of down the bottom where the dra- like a big long dragon arm is on

287
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:08,780
the ground. And I remember looking down there and thinking it was important. I feel like it's out

288
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:21,980
here. Like this way, maybe? What'd you find? Top, top, top, what? Okay. I remember running,

289
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:33,210
yep. I ran by this. Go down the well. There's a site of grace near the main road. You need to

290
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:41,449
go down the well. Okay. Hold on. Let me, let me go backwards from here. Cause I, you know,

291
00:43:41,449 --> 00:43:45,050
the reason why I didn't put this into memory at all is because I actually just sprinted

292
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:50,090
through this whole area to fight the two bosses. I like deliriously tired. So I think I just need

293
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:58,179
to go backwards and just play from here. There's a well under the dragon. Oh shit. All right.

294
00:43:58,179 --> 00:44:16,469
How'd I get that? Sons out, guns out. That's right. Okay. I fought Godfrey in this room.

295
00:44:16,469 --> 00:44:26,780
I remember that. And this went around here. Let me go down this way. Cause all these dead

296
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:36,469
um, finger ladies, don't listen to them about the well they're trolling you. I mean, I, I, I,

297
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:47,019
I'll find it. Holy grease. Okay. Times six. Jesus. Okay. Now from here, how do I go down from here?

298
00:44:47,579 --> 00:45:03,780
This is smoke. Grace in here. What's out here? Ah, this is where the roots go. And this is how

299
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:13,590
I went up the first time. Yeah. Okay. I remember this. That led all the way up there. So let me

300
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:19,380
rock down here. Did I play the demon souls remake? No. Cause getting a PlayStation five

301
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:27,460
is impossible. So no, I, I unfortunately have not played it. I have, I have absolutely no idea how

302
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:39,320
good it is. I'd love to maybe experience it one day. All right. I think I'm close. I just don't

303
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:51,110
want to miss anything. Super important, right? I get up there. Oh my God. What have I done?

304
00:45:52,070 --> 00:46:12,070
What happened? What? They, who killed him? Oh, this move is so good. This move is so good.

305
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:19,190
This baby rattle is fucking unbelievable. It really is. I got the damage on it, the scaling.

306
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:31,909
Oh, I, oh, wait, have I been here? Didn't I, did I kill that? I didn't. All right. So this is new.

307
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:35,909
This is new. This is new info. All right. I got new info. I haven't been here yet.

308
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:49,429
Let me fight this. Please show. No. Oh, the seeds over there. All right. Nice. This is why I didn't

309
00:46:49,429 --> 00:47:03,929
want to just run. I didn't want to just disappear from here. Is it aggro everybody? I had to get

310
00:47:03,929 --> 00:47:47,030
rid of these guys quick. Get out of here. Jump your fucking party horns up. Jesus Christ. Stupid

311
00:47:47,030 --> 00:48:40,230
idiot. Is he healing? Why do I feel like he's healing? I hit him with a 1500. Gargoyles halberd,

312
00:48:49,269 --> 00:48:58,860
C and E scaling. Oh, bronze halberd wielded by valiant gargoyle. Just like the wielder,

313
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:03,420
the missing parts have been mended with the corp, with corpse wax, a patchwork of champions.

314
00:49:05,929 --> 00:49:10,090
Spin. Is that that? I don't think that's, is that unique? I don't think that's a unique move.

315
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:26,940
This is the guy that growled at Chad and turned purple. Yes, it is. I fucking can't believe that's

316
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:33,429
got to be one of the, I don't even know what to say about that. All right. I definitely have not

317
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:37,269
been here, so we're just going to keep going whatever way we're going here. There it is. There

318
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:42,219
it is right there, right? Is that what I was looking for? That's definitely, yep, that's

319
00:49:42,219 --> 00:49:47,719
definitely what I was looking for. I don't even know what category you put that in, but that was

320
00:49:47,719 --> 00:49:51,719
the worst of something. That was the worst something. I don't know why, but it was bad.

321
00:49:51,719 --> 00:50:03,940
It was very bad. Do you ever need another move? I don't think so. This, this thing almost got

322
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:14,250
voted off the island too. Yep. This is absolutely where I want to be. This is exactly what I was

323
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:33,449
looking for. Does that need to go down there? There's the hand. All right. Yeah. I didn't go

324
00:50:33,449 --> 00:50:49,940
over there though. That was survivor reference. Where'd he go? Nine golden rune. Pretty sick.

325
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:55,699
So do we, do we celebrate getting to level 100? Cause that's going to happen in probably like

326
00:50:55,699 --> 00:51:02,469
10 to 20 minutes. I kicked that guy's ass by the way. Like that, I fired, I kicked that, that

327
00:51:02,469 --> 00:51:07,590
garbill's ass. Can we be, you see like those perfect dodges? Let me jump over his sword and

328
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:13,960
shit. I don't, I don't, I don't think I saw an appraise for that one. I looked over and I

329
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:20,780
saw like a couple of pogs, but like I didn't see like a wave of them. I thought that was quite

330
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:29,849
impressive. All right. Yeah. I remember, no, I sprinted through here too. It's such a fucking

331
00:51:29,849 --> 00:51:36,500
blur. This is the round table hold, right? And I sprinted through here and I was like, wow,

332
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:40,659
what is this? This is a round table. And you guys are like, go to bed, go to bed. And I was like,

333
00:51:40,659 --> 00:51:45,269
no, I don't need to go to bed. I'm just going to keep running. I, I, yeah, this is round table

334
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:52,570
hold. This is the round table hold. So let me explore this a little bit more than just

335
00:51:52,570 --> 00:52:00,730
running through it and picking up random items by my sword. Are we like all dead or something?

336
00:52:01,289 --> 00:52:09,980
Cause this is where the lady sits. Are we dead? Like, and this is, we've been dead in the real

337
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:19,960
world or something. Cause this is the round table hold and there's a bunch of dead people here.

338
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:39,059
Nobody's alive in here. Yeah. Fucking what the heck we're going to find our body.

339
00:52:41,179 --> 00:52:45,820
Aren't we? Our body is going to be lying on the fucking ground and the music is going to

340
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:51,559
kick up. The violin is going to kick in hard and it's going to be a fucking item on me.

341
00:52:55,739 --> 00:53:10,760
It's going to be a single rune fragment. So what the hell, what's okay. So what is actually

342
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:19,380
going on here? Why this has got like kind of Hunter's dream vibes to it. Is that the guy?

343
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:31,980
It's a different area. But yeah, but how we're going to find that guy and he's going to be like,

344
00:53:32,219 --> 00:54:04,179
charnished seems you found the truth. See seed bed curse. I need one more of those.

345
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:17,449
First grown on a body defiled by the dung eater, tenderpox afflicted with omen horns.

346
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:23,849
The dung eater cultivates the seed bed curse on corpses. By doing so, he prevents dead souls

347
00:54:23,849 --> 00:54:30,170
returning to the herd tree, leaving them forever cursed. One of the most loathsome things found in

348
00:54:30,170 --> 00:55:04,119
all of the lands between. I know, I know where that is. Oh no, damn it. Come on.

349
00:55:08,219 --> 00:55:15,420
All right. So I've, I'm very curious about something, but I don't want to teleport yet,

350
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:23,659
but I, let me just look through this fully completely. Yeah. Where's the, uh, where's

351
00:55:23,659 --> 00:55:43,900
the Smith usually anything else here? No, not in here. Okay. He's so high. I'm not, I'm fine.

352
00:55:48,969 --> 00:55:54,170
Wait, I don't want to miss anything. I know I'm walking around and sit. Okay. This is where the

353
00:55:54,170 --> 00:56:16,329
Smith usually is. Hmm. This is not usually open. Okay. All right. All right. Outside. What about

354
00:56:16,329 --> 00:56:24,389
the finger lady room? Yeah. I don't want to, you know, there's no, there's no rushing through Elden

355
00:56:24,389 --> 00:56:33,909
ring. This is like the best game to come out in the last 60 fucking years. Okay. You understand

356
00:56:33,909 --> 00:56:38,710
how sad you're going to be if you rush through this and then like 20 years from now, you're

357
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:47,559
going to be like, God, I wish I, I wish I'd slowed down. I wish I had slowed down and, you know,

358
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:57,960
enjoyed life more and paid more attention to the Southern side of Limgrave. I feel like I

359
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:04,300
didn't explore it completely. Chat was really odd. My case about hurrying through the game.

360
00:57:05,019 --> 00:57:20,420
Oh, grandpa, it's okay. No, it's not. This is closed. It's not what's in here. All right. That's

361
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:34,139
what, all right. That's where the, that's where the fingers are. Let me guess. Coded sword. What is

362
00:57:34,139 --> 00:57:44,500
that? And how badly do I want to look at it? Hey, fuck. Okay. What? Oh my God. This is cool.

363
00:57:48,579 --> 00:57:57,670
It only, it starts at B faith scaling, by the way, nothing else in sword. Once granted to the

364
00:57:57,670 --> 00:58:04,860
tarnished of the round table by the two fingers, a formless cipher comprises its blade, which does

365
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:11,670
holy damage. No shield can repel. Champions would gather at the round table hold and days long past

366
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:18,300
when the two fingers were masters of operation, their flesh yet full of vigor. And it has the

367
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:39,780
unblockable blade spell. Holy shit. Thanks for the bug wing from software. Why is a faith gets all

368
00:58:39,780 --> 00:59:10,039
the faith gets all the cool shit. Okay. Like really? That's so fucking awesome. Bro. It literally

369
00:59:10,039 --> 00:59:13,960
gets everything in this game. Not the cool stuff. It gets everything except the cool things.

370
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:28,250
Look at how cool that is. That's cooler than the bug wing. I know what that's like such like a straw

371
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:34,099
man, right? Like, oh yeah. Like we get the bug wing. It's like, you also get the baby rattle.

372
00:59:34,099 --> 00:59:39,380
I guarantee you there's people that have like 50 points in faith that saw this item and they went

373
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:47,610
fucking God damn it. Faith sucks. You mean to tell me I could have a solar system flail

374
00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:53,610
that does a crazy magic damage and these end fucking pieces of shit get the best stuff in

375
00:59:53,610 --> 01:00:03,110
the game. All right. So I think I got everything. That's cool. That's an amazing item. I want to,

376
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:07,860
I don't want to go that way because I'm scared to go that way. I want to go out where the

377
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:15,800
arm was. What is the scale with this scales with int at decks and at strength, but not really.

378
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:21,110
All right, let's go. That was cool. This is cool. All right. Now that I spent the first

379
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:25,349
hour walking around in a circle and just talking, uh, if we can actually do some progress here,

380
01:00:25,349 --> 01:00:29,849
which I count that fucking gargoyle. This progress. All right, let me get out of here.

381
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:41,400
Zero on fire here somewhere. I feel like they probably is. I have to go back and I want to

382
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:50,219
talk to that guy down the hall. I always, I always get like stuck in the round table hold already.

383
01:00:50,219 --> 01:00:58,119
All right. You know, I'm just jumping over the balcony. I came in here. I remember this,

384
01:00:58,119 --> 01:01:11,059
but did I explore in here? I don't think so. Not fully up yawning. There is. All right. Thank

385
01:01:11,059 --> 01:01:26,519
goodness. What? I didn't, I already had it. Think not. I shall see to that. I ask of you

386
01:01:27,159 --> 01:01:33,960
is to make the journey to the snowy mountain tops of the giants far above the clouds.

387
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:41,639
So you can burn the urge for you to commit a cardinal sin, but it must be done to reach the

388
01:01:41,639 --> 01:01:49,400
path. Do I have to do that though? Is the path I wish to travel. Well, uh, you, you wish to travel

389
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:57,610
that way, but what if I wish to travel a different way? I think we might be at ends here because like,

390
01:01:57,610 --> 01:02:03,909
Oh, this is what I want. This is what I, what about, and what about what I want? How about this?

391
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:11,820
All right. I'll burn the Erd tree, but I want you to give me 50 faith right now, right now.

392
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:27,750
Give it to me. We both get what we want. Maidenless. I'm not maidenless. Look. Okay.

393
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:33,500
So now I know where I need to go. So let's do this. This is, what's this bonfire called?

394
01:02:34,139 --> 01:02:41,610
The round table hold two or something, fortified manner, first floor. Okay. Let's go see what's

395
01:02:41,610 --> 01:03:07,860
going on here because I have a feeling he's by the usk people, which is okay. This is where that was.

396
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:08,980
So let's see what he has to say.

397
01:03:30,730 --> 01:03:39,260
All your flesh trapped in the sewer jail below the Capitol and kill you

398
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:52,710
and defile your corpse. Then the pox will truly be your own. What is the key?

399
01:03:57,130 --> 01:04:03,260
What if he, what if he kills me? I have to be careful because what if he kills me? Do I,

400
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:09,750
do I like, does it fuck a bunch of stuff up? Unlock sewer jail door said to lie beneath

401
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:23,829
Lindell, the Royal Capitol. So that's down in the sewer. Okay. Oh, okay. This guy's at.

402
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:27,380
There's a well under the dragon's wing.

403
01:04:31,219 --> 01:04:31,780
I'm going to kick his ass.

404
01:04:37,050 --> 01:04:41,820
Yeah, we'll see. Oh, you talk a lot of shit from behind that fucking computer screen. Don't you?

405
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:47,980
Mm hmm. Sure. Oh, you talk a lot of shit. I'm about to see you in fucking real life.

406
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:17,480
This guy's a literal shit eater. Oh, this is the, uh, desperate Roger.

407
01:05:20,539 --> 01:05:25,539
Yeah. He's a, he's a very close friend.

408
01:05:37,219 --> 01:05:38,019
He's a very close friend.

409
01:05:42,889 --> 01:05:43,849
This is like one of my best friends.

410
01:05:43,849 --> 01:06:12,920
I went to his wedding. I was in his wedding. So, hey, okay. Fuck. You got anything else to say?

411
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:32,739
No, I was in the wedding party. I look blown out right now. I think the light's too bright.

412
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:59,500
What the fuck is going on with this guy? Is this two people? That's his right arm

413
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:11,400
and his left arm is there. That's another person's arm. Oh, wait, it's, wait, is this one of those

414
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:15,559
costumes that you can get at the party store where it's like, oh, look, I'm riding on a dinosaur.

415
01:07:15,559 --> 01:07:23,269
And it's like, my legs are the, are the dinosaur's legs. And like, I'm, I'm like inflatable legs are

416
01:07:23,269 --> 01:07:32,619
riding the horse or whatever. Are you sure? This looks like it's two people. Wait, why,

417
01:07:32,619 --> 01:07:39,820
why is it going like this? If this was just armor, why, why are you going like this? Why are you

418
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:48,309
covering the face of the armor? That's his right arm is holding that. That's somebody else going

419
01:07:48,309 --> 01:08:00,889
like this. No, you guys got it all wrong. This is two people. This is actually two people.

420
01:08:01,530 --> 01:08:20,600
Does he have four arms? That's arm one. His, that shoulder is arm. Oh, wait, is that shoulder fake?

421
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:31,989
Is the armor like posed like this? So then why is he holding underneath? No, you guys got,

422
01:08:31,989 --> 01:08:36,949
this is two people. I can't, I can't wait till this guy stands up and like, in like another 12 hours

423
01:08:36,949 --> 01:08:43,270
and he has like four fucking blades, like general grievous style. And the other, the other head

424
01:08:43,270 --> 01:08:54,819
starts talking. Thank you. All right. So let me, I guess go to the sewer. That's interesting. Let's

425
01:08:54,819 --> 01:09:16,119
do that right now. So underneath the sewer and he's in a cell. Apparently this is under the dragon's

426
01:09:16,119 --> 01:09:33,829
wing. I'm not done exploring yet. Hold on. See exactly. This is why you can't just, this is,

427
01:09:33,829 --> 01:09:37,189
I'm telling you, this is once in a generation. Am I going to get to walk up those stairs

428
01:09:37,189 --> 01:10:06,840
and get that item for the first time? Those NPCs are friendly and you triple jump. You cannot,

429
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:19,159
you can double jump on the horse. I don't know how to get it. Oh, what is it? It's just, it's

430
01:10:19,159 --> 01:10:26,710
all right. It's, it's not purple or legendary. Those guys had dialogue. We didn't hear it.

431
01:10:29,189 --> 01:10:39,289
All right. I'm going to say the area that I wanted to go was this way, right? That way. Yes.

432
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:49,430
Progress. It's fucking cool, man. There it is. There it is. There it is. There it is. Finally.

433
01:10:49,430 --> 01:11:09,369
I found it. I found it. It's pretty fucking cool. I have to do better than that. Lightning is like

434
01:11:09,369 --> 01:11:18,420
one. You don't do it when he puts it up. It's a second after it's like, boom, dodge, boom, dodge.

435
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:40,069
I have, that was 50,000 souls. I don't want to lose those. And let's also be able to be a magician

436
01:11:40,069 --> 01:11:44,550
here. It's the guy that beat dark souls three on stream. I actually replaced that with secure

437
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:52,199
because less people did that, right? We have to like move it up. So less people beat the last

438
01:11:52,199 --> 01:11:55,399
boss in secure. Oh, then beat the last boss in dark souls three. We're going to use that from now

439
01:11:55,399 --> 01:12:13,909
on. You know what? Yep. First, that's going to take a lot longer. You don't come over here.

440
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:34,680
Oh, that hurts a lot. Please don't kill me. Please don't kill me. Don't do lightning. Don't

441
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:54,630
do that. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Damn it. Stop fucking shooting me with a bow and

442
01:12:54,630 --> 01:13:05,829
arrow for a second. These guys don't get any hit recovery Diablo two reference, but you know what

443
01:13:05,829 --> 01:14:04,630
I mean? They're like, what was that? Okay. Jeez. Ooh, that was so loud. And I'm so glad that my

444
01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:15,100
eye have a noise gate because holy shit. All right, dude, you know what? I've got, I've got

445
01:14:15,819 --> 01:14:27,449
some items. This is ridiculous. Okay. I need to craft some items. I'm going to make some of these,

446
01:14:27,449 --> 01:14:42,380
I think. All right. Some of these scale anything scale with intelligence doesn't look like it

447
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:54,649
arcane. All right. I'm just going to make, I can make 11 of these. I'm just going to make

448
01:14:54,649 --> 01:15:05,779
11 fire things. Um, I don't, I guess I'm going to make, um, some of these sure. I'm going to make

449
01:15:05,779 --> 01:15:14,100
this impede healing actually kind of cool. That's kind of cool. I think for invasions,

450
01:15:16,819 --> 01:15:26,100
I heard it. I didn't hear anything. Fire bombs alleviates blood loss. Okay. I'm going to make

451
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:30,979
some of these alleviates frost. Look, just make shit. What's the point of keeping it forever?

452
01:15:32,039 --> 01:15:37,050
Just make stuff. It's the first time I've been this long in the crafting menu and almost a

453
01:15:37,050 --> 01:15:58,869
hundred hours in the game. Okay. All right. I think I've made some stuff. Okay. So now let's

454
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:17,020
over here. Now the items here. So creepy. This is it right here. Yep. It's going to be right here.

455
01:16:17,819 --> 01:16:27,899
How would you build that? All right. What's going on? Apples stone.

456
01:16:28,539 --> 01:16:51,939
This is not it. Oh, wait. It's not it, man. It's not it. Fam. I feel like I can get up there,

457
01:16:51,939 --> 01:17:20,149
but wait, I make that good. Very good. So this is not it. Is this not as under? So it's under the

458
01:17:20,149 --> 01:17:26,229
other wing. I did want to come check this out though. Anything else I can do? I could go up

459
01:17:26,229 --> 01:17:46,199
there next game. No, I'm an Elden ring streamer. I've solidified my place as Elden ring content

460
01:17:46,199 --> 01:17:55,050
creator. Yeah. I'm not a smite streamer anymore. I'm an Elden ring streamer. All right. Well,

461
01:17:55,050 --> 01:18:14,500
this is not it, but I kind of feel like I can get up here. Maybe. What about over here? No,

462
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:20,869
it doesn't look like it. All right. Well, I'll go the other way. What about Mario golf? Yeah,

463
01:18:20,869 --> 01:18:28,460
I did play Mario golf for about two or three hours. It was fine. It was fine. It was fine.

464
01:18:29,020 --> 01:18:36,310
Okay. Those of you that want to get like a big hot take from Mr. German to tell us about how much he

465
01:18:36,310 --> 01:18:41,270
gave Mario golf for seven. It was fine. It was fun. It was interesting. The game was fun.

466
01:18:42,149 --> 01:18:50,380
I haven't watched you in 10 years. Who is the TF2 content? Um, there's 10 years worth of it

467
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:59,739
on video on demand right now. Did you guys understand that like you have the amount of

468
01:18:59,739 --> 01:19:05,579
content for every season of Seinfeld and every season of friends and every season of game of

469
01:19:05,579 --> 01:19:12,619
Thrones as team fortress to video content. Just go, go to the, go to the, my Netflix fucking page,

470
01:19:12,619 --> 01:19:19,270
whatever. Go to my YouTube page. It's like, there's like, there's like 700 days of TF2 videos.

471
01:19:21,289 --> 01:19:36,100
Probably way less than that, but you, you, you understand. Okay. So let me go over this way now.

472
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:41,619
Not net. No, I'm not, uh, don't get me in trouble. I just said like, it was like a Netflix esque

473
01:19:41,619 --> 01:19:45,220
platform of YouTube content, video on demand. All right. I'm going that way.

474
01:19:46,100 --> 01:20:08,760
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm going this way. This is new. Oh, fuck. Oh, yeah. Oh shit. That's two.

475
01:20:09,640 --> 01:21:02,579
Fuck your timings. Fucking what? Where can you even fall there? That's, I don't even understand

476
01:21:02,579 --> 01:21:10,949
where you fall there. Oh, God damn it. Am I seriously here? Whatever. Well, you just, yeah,

477
01:21:12,890 --> 01:21:21,220
I don't get it. I need to look at that. Is the baseball stream definitely happening in March?

478
01:21:21,220 --> 01:21:35,220
No, the baseball stream I can tell you right now is 100% confirmed to be the next stream that is

479
01:21:35,779 --> 01:21:47,239
like an event stream, which I mean, I really wanted it to be in March, but it's a lot of moving parts

480
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:54,680
and trying to get all those moving parts to work. It's a lot of people to have to get together,

481
01:21:55,319 --> 01:22:02,100
but I will stop at nothing. That's for him to happen over the next few months.

482
01:22:02,819 --> 01:22:13,750
Okay, let's get this guy. So when did I fall down? I didn't even know this. Okay. I like knew this.

483
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:19,880
I thought there was a railing. Where did I even fall? I thought, okay, that was weird. I thought

484
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:39,529
this was like a railing. I almost did it again. Oh, dude. Fucking dungeon down here. Oh, yeah,

485
01:22:39,529 --> 01:22:57,140
this is fucking dungeon down here. Am I, is this safe? Oh, yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. This is

486
01:22:57,140 --> 01:23:18,250
definitely something down here. Wish I could get on the horse. I saw an item and I freaked out and

487
01:23:18,250 --> 01:23:40,600
I was like, I need to go get it. All right. So where does this go? Nice. I actually really need

488
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:55,020
these. Oh shit. What's over there? I need to, I want to just keep that marked because this like

489
01:23:55,020 --> 01:24:03,430
somebody lying down over there is an invisible bridge. If this is a lie, I'm turning my stream

490
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:22,819
off. Do I? Infirm it. Otherwise it's going off. All right. Well, I can't go that way. That was

491
01:24:22,819 --> 01:24:31,579
cool. I just like this. All right, let's go back up. I want to go into this Coliseum. There are no

492
01:24:31,579 --> 01:24:35,500
invisible bridges. From Software did it once and everybody thought it was the worst thing they've

493
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:45,819
ever made. So they were like, we should probably not do that again. Actually, no, this is the

494
01:24:45,819 --> 01:24:58,579
right way. I remember playing that area in Dark Souls 3. It was in Dark Souls 2. I remember. It's

495
01:24:58,579 --> 01:25:03,689
like the weird crystal area. And I did say out loud, this is the worst thing that they've ever

496
01:25:03,689 --> 01:25:11,289
made. Didn't I? I say that all the time though. Does that not hold any more weight at all? Because

497
01:25:11,289 --> 01:25:21,510
I keep saying that it just holds no weight. This is the worst thing I think that they've made.

498
01:25:22,310 --> 01:25:28,390
All right. Well, you've said that like 15 times. Do you even like this game? Do you even like these

499
01:25:28,390 --> 01:25:32,760
fucking games? This is probably the worst fucking area they've ever made. This is the worst boss.

500
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:38,680
I think they've ever made. Jeremy, there are only two other areas that are in the game.

501
01:25:39,779 --> 01:25:49,899
Yeah, whatever. Talking in third person. He's a fucking ego weirdo. All right, pay attention.

502
01:25:49,899 --> 01:26:28,739
Eat shit. So good when you get it. That was a little cocky allegory. Oh, what do you got?

503
01:26:31,590 --> 01:26:44,409
Duelist helm. A duelist helm. What is that? Bronze helm decorated with innumerable snakes

504
01:26:45,289 --> 01:26:49,850
worn by gladiators who were driven from the Coliseum. The wearer becomes a slightly easier

505
01:26:49,850 --> 01:27:00,140
target for foes. What? You have a bigger hitbox with this on? The snake is viewed as a traitor

506
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:08,890
to the urn tree. And the audience delighted in seeing these bronze effigies beaten and battered.

507
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:27,939
Snake, tree. Is there an apple in this game? There are apples? Put it on. I mean, I look like

508
01:27:27,939 --> 01:27:44,649
a weirdo. I don't have to have a bigger hitbox for his mind. Ooh, what am I wearing right now?

509
01:27:45,770 --> 01:27:52,060
Okay, it's too intellect. Do I give a shit about intellect still? Because I have so much of it. I

510
01:27:52,060 --> 01:28:01,560
have like 60 something. Does armor even do anything in the game? Um, you know, it's funny. I've played

511
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:08,279
every single From Software game essentially since like 2010 or whatever. I still don't know what

512
01:28:08,279 --> 01:28:14,199
armor does. I just know it has blue numbers and red numbers and the blue number is better, I guess.

513
01:28:15,079 --> 01:28:21,819
I still don't even know what it does. It's just one number is 12 and the other number is like

514
01:28:21,819 --> 01:28:34,329
8. So I guess that's, it reduces it by 8%. Is that 5.8% physical damage negation?

515
01:28:40,380 --> 01:28:53,220
No. So you understand how I don't get it then. Like a 5.8. Those numbers on the right are even

516
01:28:53,220 --> 01:29:13,430
more confusing. Anyways, let's go. Nobody else is here, right? It's just this guy. All right,

517
01:29:13,430 --> 01:29:34,119
let's go. Ready? Oh, that day definitely made that better. Without a doubt. Oh, fuck you got me.

518
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:44,300
Shit. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. I got this in the

519
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:56,520
bag. Just fucking don't do an idiot move. Choke slam off the top rope. Battle hammer. All right,

520
01:29:56,520 --> 01:30:00,439
cool. That's, I know. Do I even need to look at it? Because I'm not going to use it.

521
01:30:05,060 --> 01:30:09,539
Ladditorial combat used by duelists who were exiled from the Colosseum. Why are they all

522
01:30:09,539 --> 01:30:16,579
getting kicked out of the Colosseum? These guys have all been booted from the Colosseum. What,

523
01:30:16,579 --> 01:30:35,130
what'd you do? Why? They drank, they chugged mid duel. Ritual shield talisman. They got kicked

524
01:30:35,130 --> 01:30:47,989
out of like the PvP. Raises defense when HP is at maximum. Okay. I feel like that's kind of hard to

525
01:30:47,989 --> 01:30:54,300
do though in this game. Being at 100% HP, especially in a boss fight or in mid fight, is really hard

526
01:30:54,300 --> 01:31:02,100
to be there. Maximum, right? Like see, you're always kind of hanging out around here. That

527
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:13,989
helps reduce a one-shot kill. Yeah, but you have to be at full max health. All right, cool. So I'm

528
01:31:13,989 --> 01:31:16,869
imagining there's something scary in there. Is there a bonfire I can get over something?

529
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:46,359
There's gotta be like a bonfire right here, right? Go in there. Seems wild. Dude, can I? No,

530
01:31:46,359 --> 01:31:54,970
I definitely could. I thought I could make that jump. No, you cannot. Wild. That's crazy. Nuts.

531
01:31:56,869 --> 01:32:03,720
That's reminds me of like when a game company puts like a YouTuber or like a streamer's quote

532
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:11,369
on their like Steam store page or something. German985 says, wild. Oh, craziest game. I think

533
01:32:11,369 --> 01:32:24,470
okay. Dude, that was intense. That doesn't mean they didn't say the game was good.

534
01:32:27,859 --> 01:32:34,819
Oh, German985 says, oh, that encounter was intense. He later went on to give the game a three out of

535
01:32:34,819 --> 01:32:53,779
ten. They don't say that part. Ooh, what's going on here? This is free fucking free soul, baby.

536
01:32:54,739 --> 01:33:11,750
I'm so sad. I took his shoes. That's like so fucked up. That's so fucked up. Look at the gear

537
01:33:11,750 --> 01:33:19,260
I have right now. Okay, my outfit is probably worth like 50 to 60 thousand dollars and like

538
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:25,020
I'm going to take this guy's shoes is like just regular like Skechers or something. What? Like,

539
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:31,189
do I need this? I have like 150 thousand dollars worth of stuff on me right now.

540
01:33:31,829 --> 01:33:36,149
Why would I need to take that guy's just sneakers? Why would I need to take his

541
01:33:36,149 --> 01:33:44,500
like little loafers? That's so that's so awful. Yeah, I might need these later.

542
01:33:45,140 --> 01:34:01,539
There's tons of items up here. Star fist. Oh, I got one of these too. Is this what I got?

543
01:34:05,510 --> 01:34:17,960
Oh, it's a faith thing. Okay, that's bloodlust. Yeah, it's a it's spiked hands. I gotta see these.

544
01:34:21,609 --> 01:34:38,470
Oh, I got under a sea creature. That's cool. All right, those are actually really cool.

545
01:34:39,109 --> 01:34:42,149
Strength. Really? I would think would be um, well, I guess it makes sense.

546
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:57,819
So many fucking items. Okay, that's cool. You can be Meta Knight. You can become Knuckles.

547
01:34:58,859 --> 01:35:05,159
All right, it's time to fight whatever's in here because there's absolutely somebody in here.

548
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:11,460
There's no way you have a huge Coliseum and but there's no bonfire which I'm concerned about.

549
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:26,180
And then we're going to the dragon. We're going to the sewer. No bonfire. Is there a statue at

550
01:35:26,180 --> 01:35:42,359
least? I don't think so. Maybe there's a statue. I guess I could come down from there, right?

551
01:35:44,680 --> 01:35:57,529
Wait, hold that thought. Can I go up there? Lindell is so I am just so overwhelmed. Like I

552
01:35:57,529 --> 01:36:01,529
keep seeing other I keep getting halfway to my destination and stopping going the other way.

553
01:36:03,720 --> 01:36:09,000
This is okay. This is okay. That's the sanctuary so I can come out there and go this way. All right.

554
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:25,560
Let's open this door. ADHD. That but I mean, to be honest, this is like one of the most

555
01:36:27,529 --> 01:36:31,930
so many ways to go you could just walk in a direction and then there's like five ways to go.

556
01:36:32,810 --> 01:36:37,989
And you might go one direction and then give up halfway through because you see something more

557
01:36:37,989 --> 01:36:44,340
interesting that's a mile behind you and then you don't ever get anything done. It's remarkable

558
01:36:44,340 --> 01:36:49,539
that I've gotten here so far because I just I'll always go halfway and then something else gets my

559
01:36:49,539 --> 01:37:05,930
attention and I just go the other way. Here we go. Really? Where were we going? We're going

560
01:37:05,930 --> 01:37:19,140
underneath the wing right of the dragon. Okay, let's go. I want to go over there. Shit. I want

561
01:37:19,140 --> 01:37:30,840
to go over this so bad. All right, we're going to the wing. Let me check and see if there's anything

562
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:35,210
else I didn't get here. So that I should probably just go like this, right? Because if I need to go

563
01:37:35,210 --> 01:37:57,510
to the wing and it's under here, the wing would be out this way, right? Do you see the wall? You

564
01:37:57,510 --> 01:38:02,069
have to hit like 35 times. Yeah, I heard about it. I think that's a bug. I don't think that's

565
01:38:02,069 --> 01:38:15,460
actually supposed to be in the video game. All right. That's where I need to go, right? I'm

566
01:38:15,460 --> 01:38:26,470
really far away from this fucking thing. That's a bug. So I'm way too far away. I need to go

567
01:38:27,270 --> 01:38:38,920
like over here. Yeah, I'll go closer. I think I have to go under the wing and then I need to go

568
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:50,149
way further in here. All right, here we go. I gotta go there. Under which wing? Under the big wing

569
01:38:50,149 --> 01:39:12,390
there? Like over there? Under here? All right, let's go. Wasn't I already over here? I was already

570
01:39:12,390 --> 01:40:03,260
over here. Is it right here? Oh, it's right here. All right. Okay, let's do it. I found it. Oh,

571
01:40:03,260 --> 01:40:10,680
fuck. I don't open this. This is the- I gotta use the key here. Is there something to- I- but what

572
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:23,590
if I get killed? What if he kills me? He said he was gonna- he said he was gonna like do weird- he

573
01:40:23,590 --> 01:40:44,869
was gonna do something horrible to me. There's definitely a bonfire down here. Hopefully that's

574
01:40:44,869 --> 01:41:13,420
not- I fucking need starlight or just buy the lantern. It's like a hundred runes.

575
01:41:17,140 --> 01:41:21,829
Oh my god, I need it. I didn't- I never bought the lantern. I didn't buy the binoculars either.

576
01:41:22,729 --> 01:41:29,189
Okay, I gotta come back. Gotta buy a fucking lantern. Do I have a torch?

577
01:41:35,449 --> 01:41:39,050
How do I not even have the torch? How do I not have any of these items?

578
01:41:39,689 --> 01:42:00,409
There'll be a bonfire down here, right? And I can just put on starlight. Oh, fuck. I don't

579
01:42:00,409 --> 01:42:25,060
open that. Get the lantern. Okay. But there might be a bonfire down here. I can just put

580
01:42:25,060 --> 01:42:32,579
starlight on and it's easy. I'm gonna terrify- it's so dark down here. Okay, that's not the cell.

581
01:42:38,020 --> 01:42:55,579
All right. Subterranean shunning grounds? What? Oh lord. Is there a bonfire down here? That has to

582
01:42:55,579 --> 01:43:24,819
be. All right, I gotta be careful. I'm gonna be a total dickhead here. Dude. Boy. Nice damage. Yeah.

583
01:43:24,819 --> 01:43:52,489
Yeah. I'm not looking to- I'm looking to win. All right. One, two, three. Oh my god, there's so

584
01:43:52,489 --> 01:44:17,619
many. It's just a regular enemy. I'm so fucked. I hear- I hear, uh, sprinkles. All right, let's go.

585
01:44:18,630 --> 01:45:25,079
One at a time, I should be all right. Don't go this way! No backstab! Oh! What the fuck? Jesus,

586
01:45:25,079 --> 01:45:33,369
these guys are fucking crazy. There's only one more. I just gotta kill one more.

587
01:45:33,369 --> 01:45:50,489
Minus two joke? What? What'd I do? What'd I say? I didn't even say anything. I didn't do anything.

588
01:45:50,489 --> 01:46:16,069
Oh, I've never been so relieved. Okay, I can level up. Do I get endurance to 20? Is it level 100?

589
01:46:16,069 --> 01:46:22,300
You had dead air? I am dodging for my life here, okay? I'm sorry that I'm not, like,

590
01:46:22,300 --> 01:46:27,420
iframe, iframe, iframe, dodge, attack, dodge. Sorry, I went to Dunkin' Donuts today. No,

591
01:46:27,420 --> 01:46:31,500
I'm fucking concentrating. I can't just, like, tell you about the Dunkin' Donuts drive-through

592
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:43,300
story. Not when I'm doing that. All right, I need- okay, so let me tell you. I was on an airplane

593
01:46:43,300 --> 01:46:49,510
recently. I would get hit every- I would- I can't speak when I play these games. I'm doing endurance.

594
01:46:49,510 --> 01:46:57,670
I feel like it's gonna really bite me in the ass if I don't. Now, let's take one second. Okay,

595
01:46:57,670 --> 01:47:07,300
this is- thank god. Underground roadside. This- this motherfucker has the lantern in the first

596
01:47:07,380 --> 01:47:24,630
10 minutes of the game, right? No, just buy the binoculars, too. Who cares? I don't have any of

597
01:47:24,630 --> 01:47:40,819
this stuff. Who has it? It's in Lunera, okay. All right, talk to that guy. All right, wait, where is

598
01:47:40,819 --> 01:47:57,239
it? I'm so glad they put the NPCs on the map. You don't have him on your map. You know what?

599
01:47:57,239 --> 01:48:02,439
Fucking don't care. All right, I'm- whatever, I don't care. I don't care. Here's what we're gonna

600
01:48:02,439 --> 01:48:11,189
do. I'm gonna use my spells because I'm a fucking wizard, okay? I haven't used- okay, I treat spells

601
01:48:11,189 --> 01:48:18,199
in this game the same way that I treat apps on my iPad. If I haven't opened them in over two weeks,

602
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:24,279
I delete them. It doesn't matter what was on them. So, I have not used eternal darkness in

603
01:48:25,079 --> 01:48:30,199
two in-game days. Two in-game weeks. It's getting deleted. I'm obviously not going to use it ever

604
01:48:30,199 --> 01:48:48,380
again. So, where's starlight? Buy a torch, you one percenter. What do you mean? Why are you saying

605
01:48:48,380 --> 01:48:59,029
that? Why are you saying that? One- why are you calling me a one percenter? Do you mean like I

606
01:48:59,029 --> 01:49:10,649
have a lot of runes? What do you mean? It's not- okay, let's go. I- so much shit that I don't even

607
01:49:10,649 --> 01:49:19,689
have explored. This game is fucking crazy. I can't believe this game is real. It's like so much.

608
01:49:20,329 --> 01:49:37,960
Buy a torch? I have starlight. Starlight's better than a torch. It fills the whole room. It's better

609
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:47,189
than the torch. I mean, I do get like kind of pool eyes, like chlorine eyes, but whatever.

610
01:49:47,189 --> 01:50:14,569
Is there anything else in this room? All right, get him. Wait. Okay, let's go. He didn't like that.

611
01:50:15,210 --> 01:51:00,170
Oh, you are not even mad for me. Oh my god. Oh, I am unstoppable. Could be the best weapon art in

612
01:51:00,170 --> 01:51:10,680
the game. I never would have thought it was moon build. Nope. And everyone- oh wow. So, I watched

613
01:51:10,680 --> 01:51:18,470
blood-soaked mask. Jesus. I watched this guy trip on 9.85 and he- the bastard stars turned out to be

614
01:51:18,470 --> 01:51:21,989
like one of the better items, especially in BPP. You know, I didn't think that they were going to

615
01:51:21,989 --> 01:51:45,029
be that good. Turns out that's a lot of runes. What an ego. There's a lot of those guys. There's

616
01:51:45,029 --> 01:51:48,470
like two in that room. All right, so I can go down, but let me see. There's another room I can go in,

617
01:51:48,470 --> 01:52:00,600
right? I'm not quite ready to go down. Maybe I am. I'll go this way. Uh, I'm gonna go this way.

618
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:12,090
Why not? Remind me that that exists up there, because I'll forget. The boys on, uh, on call?

619
01:52:12,090 --> 01:52:39,699
Yeah, there. I did just upgrade them. Freezing grease. God fucking damn it. Thankfully, it's not

620
01:52:39,699 --> 01:52:55,449
far. I did not think it went down that far. That goes down an eternity. I thought it was maybe a-

621
01:52:56,090 --> 01:53:28,359
maybe 50 feet, maybe tops. Okay, so I thought it was- yeah, whatever. So I- I hear the sprinkles!

622
01:53:28,359 --> 01:53:42,279
I hear sprinkles and I- I want it! Oh, hi there. Blankum. Hey, buffed comet. Comet is so much

623
01:53:42,279 --> 01:53:50,520
better. Comet is a million times better. I would say a hundred million. Before, it was- you can

624
01:53:50,520 --> 01:54:01,819
only cast it like once or twice. You can cast it like four times now. Yeah, maybe I need more mine,

625
01:54:01,819 --> 01:54:18,680
but you know. Where is the sprinkles? I hear it. Probably below me. Fuck out of here.

626
01:54:26,340 --> 01:54:42,890
Right. Right! This baby rattle does not seem safe for children. It's because it's an adult baby

627
01:54:42,890 --> 01:55:04,069
rattle. It's an adult rattle. Why do I have such low mana? Uh, because I didn't put many points into

628
01:55:04,069 --> 01:55:10,220
mind. This casting was not supposed to be number one for me. I don't know, a lot of people have

629
01:55:10,220 --> 01:55:15,579
been very upset with me because I haven't been using my spells that frequently. And let me tell

630
01:55:15,579 --> 01:55:25,720
you. First of all, fuck up. Second of all, uh, C1. And number three, I wanted to make a character

631
01:55:25,720 --> 01:55:47,930
that scaled on intelligence with weapons. Sorry. Oh, that was based. Because I want a two-handed

632
01:55:47,930 --> 01:55:56,600
intelligence weapon. I wanted a two-handed intelligence weapon. Fucked up. All right,

633
01:55:56,600 --> 01:56:01,939
pay attention because I just like forgot where I was. Wait. Oh, this- this is like- this is what

634
01:56:01,939 --> 01:56:09,060
I'm talking about. I can go like three different directions. I don't know which one- I don't know

635
01:56:09,060 --> 01:56:16,550
which one to do. There's so many places to go. I feel like I'm in like the McDonald's play place.

636
01:56:16,550 --> 01:56:20,310
It's just like a- do I go down the slide? Do I go in the ball pit? Do I go and climb through the

637
01:56:20,310 --> 01:56:24,869
tunnels up there? There's too many choices. The McDonald's play pit is the Dark Souls, uh,

638
01:56:24,869 --> 01:56:37,590
of like kids entertainment, by the way. Some of the- there's shortcuts? Don't you guys want to see,

639
01:56:37,590 --> 01:56:41,350
uh, don't you guys want to see Miyazaki make a fucking McDonald's play place?

640
01:56:42,939 --> 01:56:45,420
God, that would be so cool. Can you imagine how crazy that would be?

641
01:56:51,859 --> 01:56:54,819
I'm telling you, there's a cross promotion there somewhere. I think that it's-

642
01:56:55,380 --> 01:57:04,949
it could be huge. I couldn't get out of this area without a guide. Wait, you physically didn't know

643
01:57:04,949 --> 01:57:12,619
how to leave? Like you- can you not teleport out? Oh. Oh, I thought you meant like you physically

644
01:57:12,619 --> 01:57:16,539
couldn't physically leave. Like you didn't know where to go and you didn't- you couldn't teleport.

645
01:57:17,020 --> 01:57:27,560
That's funny. If that- if that actually happens. All right, pay attention. Um, I came from this way.

646
01:57:28,520 --> 01:57:33,159
Did I? All of a sudden you're gonna hear like- you're gonna hear-

647
01:57:38,310 --> 01:57:45,220
fucking kids are just going through these tubes. You're just gonna hear like,

648
01:57:45,779 --> 01:58:05,100
ow! Stop! Do you hear like a slide down here? All right, stop getting overwhelmed and stop

649
01:58:05,100 --> 01:58:09,720
being weird. Let's go. I'm gonna go this way. I've chosen to go this way.

650
01:58:11,859 --> 01:58:18,729
This is the entrance. Turn around and go the other way. There we go. This is the way. I'm

651
01:58:18,729 --> 01:58:35,210
gonna go this way. I'm gonna go over here and I'm gonna head this way and I'm gonna jump down

652
01:58:35,770 --> 01:58:43,130
onto this pipe. That is what I've decided. That's what I've chosen. And lobsters down here.

653
01:58:53,109 --> 01:59:13,909
Oh, that hurt. Did I do that wrong? Oh, sick! You see? He would be unnatural at making a play place.

654
01:59:24,279 --> 01:59:41,140
Or a dog park. Oh, shit. That's bad.

655
01:59:52,329 --> 02:00:15,050
What are you doing? Run. Run. My eye- my eyeball is itching. He's like stuck in his ass.

656
02:00:18,970 --> 02:00:37,399
What the fuck? Did he just spit at me? What the hell? What was that? What? What? Oh my god.

657
02:00:38,439 --> 02:00:48,699
I can't even fucking react to it. It's gonna kill me. Stop being so confident. But this is

658
02:00:49,100 --> 02:01:16,380
how this has to work. Oh my god. Just fuck you. Your friend over there needs to-

659
02:01:17,500 --> 02:01:30,840
The thing's just a spinning stump. Don't! Oh, I'm dead. All right, I got the spinning stump.

660
02:01:31,560 --> 02:01:59,079
These guys have a ton of health. He died to lobsters omega low. Dead. Just don't do any damage,

661
02:01:59,079 --> 02:02:09,659
actually. I got a plus nine bastard stars, man. And I got like 57 intelligence. I'm doing

662
02:02:09,659 --> 02:02:15,180
damage. This is just- these guys are hard. This is a hard area. This is an area that is very,

663
02:02:15,180 --> 02:02:20,460
very tricky. It's very- it's a late game. A moment to late game, you know? Later game.

664
02:02:21,979 --> 02:02:27,020
I'm not fighting. These guys are just gonna fall off and die. See who cares. Oh, that's bad.

665
02:02:28,409 --> 02:02:36,460
Is there- okay, right there. Let's see. That's a quick way to do it.

666
02:02:37,180 --> 02:02:45,140
Don't miss. All right, I'm good. He'll die if he lands here. All right, we're good. So, where are

667
02:02:45,140 --> 02:02:51,770
my souls? It wasn't really that many, but you know. All right, I'm just gonna get items and run.

668
02:02:52,489 --> 02:03:11,289
Really? You're gonna- that was bullshit. You waited till I- Why are lobsters the hardest enemy in the

669
02:03:11,289 --> 02:03:21,590
game? That's a lot. I gotta get all these things. This is- this is smithing- smithing stone seven.

670
02:03:23,819 --> 02:03:44,949
No way I don't get all these. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Over here. I think it's on seven.

671
02:03:44,949 --> 02:03:54,760
Holy shit. This is the place to go to get these. I couldn't do anything. I couldn't- I couldn't

672
02:03:54,760 --> 02:04:02,229
move. I didn't have- I couldn't move. What the fuck? I want that. Whatever it is. I actually

673
02:04:02,229 --> 02:04:21,210
couldn't move. No roll? No, it was- I was- the animation wasn't done. Okay, well, I don't need-

674
02:04:21,210 --> 02:04:36,329
I don't have to climb down that. Just fall. All right. So, whatever it is, get it, and then I gotta

675
02:04:36,329 --> 02:04:53,260
figure out where I am. Okay, there's one more. Get the fuck away from me! It's right behind me.

676
02:04:55,180 --> 02:05:11,930
Mog's Shackle? Oh, I can go that way. Mog's Shackle. Ooh, whoa. You can't get in here,

677
02:05:11,930 --> 02:05:25,210
right? Oh shit, bonfire. Nice. Hell yeah. Okay, so what did I- he's got something.

678
02:05:26,010 --> 02:05:45,029
Mog's Shackle. It's a key. Was it a key? It wasn't a key? Was it a talisman? It wasn't a weapon,

679
02:05:45,029 --> 02:06:10,470
was it? Where is it? Am I just stupid? Did I just pass over it? There it is. Mog briefly binds Mog

680
02:06:11,430 --> 02:06:20,649
once imprisoned to Earth. Pettish bathes in golden magic. Shackles were used to bind the accursed

681
02:06:20,649 --> 02:06:26,090
people called the Omen, and these ones were made to keep a particular Omen under strictest confinement.

682
02:06:26,810 --> 02:06:32,810
Though faint, the shackles still retained vestiges of power, enough to trap the once-bound

683
02:06:32,810 --> 02:06:41,579
Mog on Earth, if only for a short time. Binds Mog. Wait, if I just use this, what happens?

684
02:06:43,930 --> 02:06:53,000
Do I, like, converse with Mog? If I- can I- do I- do I spawn Mog right here? If I use it right here?

685
02:06:59,720 --> 02:07:08,579
All right, I gotta go up this way. You use it when you fight Mog. Who the fuck is Mog?

686
02:07:09,300 --> 02:07:20,149
Am I supposed to know who that is? Wait! I'll get it. Wait! I'll get it. Jesus, this- look at how

687
02:07:20,149 --> 02:07:26,069
confused- this- I don't even know- there's so many ways. Is there too many ways to go?

688
02:07:33,609 --> 02:07:50,920
This was up. This is up. I can- I can go down still from that bonfire. I gotta remember that.

689
02:07:51,800 --> 02:08:06,659
What? Where did you come from? I think these guys just spawned. You've killed Mog twice. What are

690
02:08:06,659 --> 02:08:14,420
you talking about? Who did I- I didn't kill anybody. Who's Mog? I have not killed Mog?

691
02:08:15,220 --> 02:08:34,970
Who the fuck is Mog? Mo- wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait

692
02:08:34,970 --> 02:08:52,359
a minute. Mo- I thought Margit and Mor- Mor- aren't they the same person? They're the- they're the

693
02:08:52,359 --> 02:08:58,869
same person. What do you mean I've killed Mog? I've killed, like, three versions of the other guy.

694
02:08:59,829 --> 02:09:21,640
I have no idea. You haven't killed Mog. Oh, Mog, Mog, Mog, Moggy. How many- whoa! Shut up.

695
02:09:22,199 --> 02:09:35,430
You fucking idiot. You should have drank way before. I try- I try to dodge. I didn't do it.

696
02:09:35,430 --> 02:10:03,579
I'm gonna die. Relax. I'm fine. I'm fine. Shut up. Shit. Did I have souls somewhere buried here?

697
02:10:04,220 --> 02:10:19,689
What happened to them? What did you do with them? Oh shit, this is- okay. This is the

698
02:10:19,850 --> 02:10:41,659
bad first area, right? Yes. Yes. Is it- bonfire is over there. Yes. Yes. Let's keep going. I, my lord.

699
02:11:01,079 --> 02:11:10,920
Wait, I've already- I've already been here. Haven't I been over here? I already did this.

700
02:11:15,340 --> 02:11:30,569
Uh, yeah, I did this already. This just goes back up. So then I have to go from here instead of going

701
02:11:30,569 --> 02:11:34,010
this way. I go- yeah, because that's where the elevator is, so I can keep going down.

702
02:11:34,890 --> 02:11:50,090
Okay. Didn't I pull the lever? Walk by- I pulled the lever, didn't I? I thought I pulled it. No?

703
02:11:50,090 --> 02:12:11,670
What the fuck did I pull then? Wrong lever. What? You guys have a fucking million health.

704
02:12:21,430 --> 02:12:46,020
Ugh. That was a backstab and you all know it. Don't get poisoned. All right. There was another

705
02:12:46,020 --> 02:13:12,359
contraption to pull? I know you- I knew you were right there. Thought I was going over there,

706
02:13:12,439 --> 02:13:24,619
didn't you? Shit, I'm dead. I feel like I need to- under the flask thing. You know what I mean?

707
02:13:24,619 --> 02:13:28,390
Under the sacred tier. I feel like I'm not healing as much as I should be.

708
02:13:37,460 --> 02:13:54,340
Well, a hundred damage. Ghost glove ward. Nice. Very nice. Always check the ceilings. You want

709
02:13:54,340 --> 02:13:57,220
a tip for FromSoftware games? Every time you go in a corridor, just go like this.

710
02:13:58,020 --> 02:14:40,710
How do you not kill the other guy? I didn't even get fucking hit. Not going- let me go over here

711
02:14:40,710 --> 02:14:54,140
first. He's still in the toilet. It'd be weird if I was, wouldn't it? Okay. I know I can do this,

712
02:14:54,140 --> 02:15:14,390
right? Yeah. Bring me up. Bring me up. I want to go up here. Bring me up. All right. I think it's

713
02:15:14,390 --> 02:15:50,579
just a- it's just one of these things. Oh shit. It's Mog. That was really dumb. Fuck you. Let me

714
02:15:50,579 --> 02:16:49,909
get it off. Get out of here. Fucking Mog down. Mog down. That guy's kind of crazy. That's Mog

715
02:16:49,909 --> 02:17:04,780
down. Incrucible scale talisman. Holy shit. What is this? Raises damage taken from critical hits.

716
02:17:04,780 --> 02:17:11,100
What? A talisman fashioned from a scale that embodies the aspects of various creatures.

717
02:17:11,100 --> 02:17:17,819
Said to have grown on the human body long ago. It's a heart. Reduces damage taken from critical

718
02:17:17,819 --> 02:17:31,350
hits. I mean, that's kind of cool. Good for PvP. Yeah. What level are you? I'm level 100. Exactly.

719
02:17:33,510 --> 02:17:35,829
You guys talked all this shit about Mog. That was not even a problem.

720
02:17:36,549 --> 02:17:54,739
That's kind of cool. It's bad in PvP as well. All right. So now we're going to keep heading this way.

721
02:17:56,540 --> 02:18:08,360
That was pretty fucking cool, dude. All right. Up here. That guy was harder than-

722
02:18:08,920 --> 02:18:12,040
well, actually that's not true considering I just beat him with the first try.

723
02:18:12,920 --> 02:18:17,459
That was a really interesting move set. What do you got?

724
02:18:19,850 --> 02:18:34,469
Didn't think I was in reach. Holy shit, man. God. Oh my goodness. I got too cocky fighting fucking

725
02:18:35,670 --> 02:18:57,850
Mag. You're on the fucking stairs, bullshit. I got plenty of mana. Fucking cast it.

726
02:19:05,260 --> 02:19:22,069
Oh shit. Why didn't I cast it the first time? How come I didn't cast it the first time? I had

727
02:19:22,069 --> 02:19:29,829
mana. Oh, now I'm all the way over. Whatever. I don't have to go fight that other guy. I got

728
02:19:31,909 --> 02:19:44,170
dog shit. That was what we like to call in the industry. Dog shit. Just got Mogged.

729
02:19:51,059 --> 02:19:57,559
No, what happened was that guy, I had an intense battle with his brother or his other teammate.

730
02:19:58,729 --> 02:20:05,299
He was way stronger than him in every way. And then he got the last hit on me because we

731
02:20:05,299 --> 02:20:09,829
happened to have to fight again. Like this guy did not beat me. Let's be really honest.

732
02:20:10,549 --> 02:20:15,670
That's like if I sit there and try to open the jar that's really tight over and over again,

733
02:20:15,670 --> 02:20:20,629
I'm using all my strength. Then you open it and look and see how strong you are. No, I did that.

734
02:20:20,629 --> 02:20:28,120
You just came in and kill stole my fucking jar. That's what happened. Why can I not fucking fight

735
02:20:28,120 --> 02:20:54,860
this guy? I've fought like 10 of them so far. How do you stay and not get staggered by that?

736
02:21:14,309 --> 02:21:21,829
Fuck you. Why am I so tilted fighting this guy? I've killed 10 of your fucking siblings by now.

737
02:21:21,829 --> 02:21:29,190
With no problem at all. These guys fucking drive me crazy. I've killed like 10 of this person's

738
02:21:29,190 --> 02:21:34,389
siblings without an issue. And I'm just getting hit by every fucking one of his goddamn moves.

739
02:21:43,670 --> 02:21:53,850
What? Oh shit, I had the physics thing on. Dude, I beat Magic Mog first try and get hit twice.

740
02:21:55,049 --> 02:22:00,170
Regular ass Mog comes at me and fucking kills me over and over and over again.

741
02:22:03,959 --> 02:22:11,239
I'm too confident fighting regular Mog. I got too much confidence because Magic Mog was

742
02:22:11,239 --> 02:22:19,540
fucking decimated and it was very tough. Jesus Christ. Come on, man. Here we go.

743
02:23:02,840 --> 02:23:13,079
Why is it not staggering? It staggers everybody else. My God, you regular ass Mog. I swear to God

744
02:23:13,079 --> 02:23:31,299
if you kill me again. Don't fucking die to regular ass Mog. Okay, we're good. Oh, Omen cleaver.

745
02:23:37,049 --> 02:23:43,540
It's just strength, like a quality weapon. Heavy bladed curved sword of colossal size

746
02:23:43,540 --> 02:23:48,739
awarded to Omen as a tool of war. This weapon is made to take advantage of brute strength.

747
02:23:49,299 --> 02:23:55,659
It's de-scaling with strength and it requires 19 to put it on. That's not brute strength to me.

748
02:23:58,299 --> 02:24:13,209
Kind of cool, I guess. It's cool. Oh, that swinging pattern is actually really good.

749
02:24:18,100 --> 02:24:21,620
I don't really like those though. I don't like the slam. It's too close.

750
02:24:22,260 --> 02:24:33,260
That R1 is really good though. Curved greatswords are POG. They seem like it.

751
02:24:34,059 --> 02:24:41,510
Okay, well, let's keep going. Brave Glovewart 9. That's probably almost the max, right?

752
02:24:42,389 --> 02:25:04,579
Is Glovewart 10 the max? Just checking. I know. Wait a minute. I haven't been down here.

753
02:25:08,180 --> 02:25:20,889
It looks like I was down there. Wasn't I down here? Was I not down here? Okay, what's over here?

754
02:25:21,450 --> 02:25:46,360
What's over here? Wait, why is this open? Wait, what? What? When did I open that? Oh, shit.

755
02:25:47,399 --> 02:26:07,610
That's, um, the first one that I pulled? Oh, fuck. It's a MOG. It's MOG. It's a regular MOG.

756
02:26:11,799 --> 02:26:22,299
Yeah? Oh, is that what you're gonna try to do? Fucking MOG Jr.? Dude, fight this guy back here.

757
02:26:22,299 --> 02:26:50,149
Fight this guy back here. Okay, we just have to fight one more regular ass MOG and that's it.

758
02:26:50,870 --> 02:26:55,590
And then I can keep progressing. It's just one MOG and he's got the sword. It's the one that I

759
02:26:55,590 --> 02:27:27,030
don't like to fight. Thank God. Golden Rune 11. All right, the MOG room has been defeated.

760
02:27:27,030 --> 02:27:37,059
Why does it look like I can go back here? That looks like I can go back there, right?

761
02:27:37,620 --> 02:27:48,600
Kind of weird. Yeah, man, you beat MOG. Yeah, I know. So that was the first one that I pulled

762
02:27:49,159 --> 02:28:00,950
because I pulled a lever already. So there's another one. Okay, so I need to pull the second

763
02:28:00,950 --> 02:28:17,659
lever, which I guess I'm gonna go over here. Oh, I went down there already. Is there a place I

764
02:28:17,659 --> 02:28:55,340
didn't go? Uh, this way. Uh, wait. I was already here. I think I left. Um, didn't I- I don't know

765
02:28:55,340 --> 02:29:20,979
what kind of fucking MOG trickery this is, but I didn't- okay, I didn't go this way. Wait. Wait,

766
02:29:20,979 --> 02:29:46,309
what? Why is he back? I'm not fighting him. This is weird. What's going on? Where's the- he revived.

767
02:29:46,709 --> 02:30:23,690
Holy shit, he kicked over my fucking head. Stun him! All right. All right, there's two MOGs

768
02:30:23,690 --> 02:30:46,229
dead here. Am I gonna come back and there's gonna be a third one? What's up there? I did this, but

769
02:30:46,229 --> 02:30:56,920
is it- is this different now? This brings me back up to that room with this guy in it, and then-

770
02:30:57,639 --> 02:31:14,600
wait, this is different. Dude, weren't- weren't we doing something? You know what I mean? Like,

771
02:31:14,600 --> 02:31:20,680
we- we were doing something. I'm in this dungeon now. What happened? How did I even get here?

772
02:31:21,639 --> 02:31:28,729
I actually don't even know how I got here. I was like looking for the dung guy, and then all of

773
02:31:28,729 --> 02:31:47,979
a sudden I'm in one of these dungeons? I don't know how this happened. Okay, so this is- I go down this

774
02:31:47,979 --> 02:32:15,190
ladder? Where does this go? Oh shit, there it is. But don't get killed. Wait, somebody's gonna jump

775
02:32:15,190 --> 02:32:23,959
me here. Somebody's gonna push me off the edge. Okay, so that's to the- now I can go back to the

776
02:32:23,959 --> 02:32:34,969
entrance, right? That should be the- the- that should be it. There's a bonfire right there.

777
02:32:37,700 --> 02:32:56,040
Help is right. Now if I go this way it should be right here, right? Dude, how do I get out of here?

778
02:32:56,040 --> 02:33:06,040
This is all so new. You weren't here before, were you? How do I get the fuck out of here?

779
02:33:06,040 --> 02:33:22,819
You're going the wrong way? Uh, so back this way and then through the other door? There's no way out.

780
02:33:23,829 --> 02:33:33,340
Sorry, you were actually- you were going the right way, was I? As long as I considered a bonfire and

781
02:33:33,340 --> 02:33:37,020
then it's- it's the door right next to here. Okay, this is it right here. And there's the bonfire.

782
02:33:37,659 --> 02:33:44,059
All right, nice. That was kind of weird. I have to pee real bad. So we're gonna walk in here,

783
02:33:44,059 --> 02:34:02,180
probably die, and then I'm gonna go pee. Five golden seeds, really? And then two spine. I- I

784
02:34:02,180 --> 02:34:08,739
kind of- I might- I'm gonna lose all these runes probably, but I want to see what it is. Let's find

785
02:34:08,739 --> 02:34:14,229
out. See if I can do it first try. Both headphones going in. Let's see if I can get it. If this is

786
02:34:14,229 --> 02:34:26,299
three mobs, I'm gonna be very mad. Ezgar, Priest of Blood. Come right up on me, huh?

787
02:34:27,930 --> 02:35:06,819
Can do that. Yo! What are these fucking bugs? Get out of here.

788
02:35:33,530 --> 02:36:07,219
Did I die? Oh, he did. Okay, let's go. Lord of Blood's ex- exultation. That was kind of scary.

789
02:36:07,219 --> 02:36:15,129
Blood loss in vicinity increases attack power. Where's the attack power when blood loss occurs in-

790
02:36:15,129 --> 02:36:24,170
okay, I don't understand this. What does this mean? When blood loss occurs, does that- okay,

791
02:36:24,170 --> 02:36:28,780
I don't understand this. Does that mean if I get blood loss, my attack power goes up?

792
02:36:29,340 --> 02:36:35,530
Or does that mean if somebody has attack power, blood power, then it goes up if I'm in the area?

793
02:36:35,530 --> 02:36:43,159
I have to be bled for- like, I have to be bled. When blood loss occurs in the vicinity,

794
02:36:47,159 --> 02:36:55,719
any- any enemy or you. Oh, okay, that's cool. This is really good. That was kind of a cool dungeon.

795
02:36:55,719 --> 02:37:10,059
I- I guess we did it. It's either you or the enemy. Okay, cool. So, I don't even- we were-

796
02:37:10,620 --> 02:37:15,739
yeah, we were like all the way back here. All right, I gotta remember- I gotta pee.

797
02:37:16,379 --> 02:37:21,430
Let's pee. I'll be right back. Give me like, I don't know, two minutes? Three minutes?

798
02:37:22,229 --> 02:43:36,729
Kirby, you know something? For the first time in a long time, my room is not like 80 degrees.

799
02:43:36,729 --> 02:43:44,520
It's actually kind of nice in here. I wonder what happened. Have you played Cuphead? I-

800
02:43:45,159 --> 02:43:52,309
I streamed Cuphead and I beat the game. That's uh, available to watch as a video on demand.

801
02:43:52,309 --> 02:43:54,709
I did- I did play it. I'm gonna play the DLC when it comes out.

802
02:44:01,219 --> 02:44:14,809
Real fans. You beat Cuphead? Yeah, I'm looking forward to the DLC. Turn the audio back up. All

803
02:44:14,809 --> 02:44:22,340
right, I really needed to pee apparently. That was kind of ridiculous. Am I too blown out? Maybe.

804
02:44:25,159 --> 02:44:36,920
All right, so I need to figure out how much is- I can definitely do it. Did I tell you

805
02:44:37,399 --> 02:44:43,079
I want to do a run where I don't break any of these for the entire playthrough until like the

806
02:44:43,079 --> 02:44:49,270
last third of the game? So just save up like 200 of these and then get like a million souls in

807
02:44:49,270 --> 02:44:57,340
one minute and then level up like 30 times. I feel like that'd be like kind of fun. All right,

808
02:44:57,340 --> 02:45:08,620
I need a lot more than that. You'll only level up twice. Not with this many. There are a lot of

809
02:45:08,620 --> 02:45:18,090
these in the game. There are a ton. How's my camera moving? How's the mouse moving my camera?

810
02:45:18,649 --> 02:45:28,600
I need 60 something thousand. Maybe one of these will do it. Okay, I'm still gonna go with endurance.

811
02:45:28,600 --> 02:45:37,659
I feel like that's important. Get it to 20. Once endurance is 20, then and only then will I start

812
02:45:37,659 --> 02:45:40,860
putting points into mind and that's pretty much where I'm gonna end. I'll probably end up doing

813
02:45:40,860 --> 02:45:50,889
that till the end. Maybe a little bit more in intelligence. Okay, so where the hell was I going?

814
02:45:51,610 --> 02:46:00,500
It was this little cave here and then there's an elevator that went back up. So I want to stay down

815
02:46:00,500 --> 02:46:10,200
here, right? Why? Is it where the lobsters are? Is there another way to go from the lobsters?

816
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:35,260
What are the roadside graces? I'm already underground. I think it is back up. This

817
02:46:35,260 --> 02:46:41,219
doesn't count as an underground map, does it? Interesting. Okay, there's a hole in the floor

818
02:46:41,219 --> 02:47:02,809
near the grace. Well, let me just go up. Okay. Yeah, so then this takes me back out of here,

819
02:47:03,610 --> 02:47:26,389
which leads out to where all those imps were, right? Okay. Fuck you. What? Where am I?

820
02:47:27,110 --> 02:47:35,590
Oh, right, right, right. Okay, okay, okay. Now I can go up. Do I want to go up? Do I want to climb

821
02:47:35,590 --> 02:48:01,670
this? Fuck you, Mog3. As soon as he moves. Oh, I made it. What are you gonna do? You can't climb

822
02:48:01,670 --> 02:48:15,079
this. Good. All right. Interesting. Very interesting. Is the rest of the grace nearby?

823
02:48:15,719 --> 02:48:32,649
Is that the hole you were talking about? No, they can climb. This guy is not climbing this

824
02:48:32,649 --> 02:48:43,639
ladder. I am assuring you of this. There's not a chance in hell. This is where I came from. Oh,

825
02:48:43,639 --> 02:48:47,959
fuck. You're right. Okay, well, let's go. Let me go rest of the bonfire and get my bearings here.

826
02:48:48,600 --> 02:49:09,620
Okay, so that door is locked. Was there another way I could go from here? We go down there again.

827
02:49:10,180 --> 02:49:13,299
We like the imps were. I don't think there's anything else over there.

828
02:49:14,020 --> 02:49:25,590
I feel like this probably somewhere. Okay, so I got to get up there. How do I get up there?

829
02:49:26,229 --> 02:49:43,829
They went all the way down. All right, so from here,

830
02:49:44,790 --> 02:50:03,940
can't really really get out of here. All right, I can go that way.

831
02:50:05,620 --> 02:50:12,309
Get the fuck out of here. There's too many of you. We're going to go this way. Oh my god. No,

832
02:50:12,309 --> 02:50:19,799
we're not. There's 200 of you. Where are they coming from? Why is there like a Minecraft

833
02:50:19,799 --> 02:50:25,319
monster spawner right here? Oh, fall. Go back up hole in floor. Go back, go back, go back,

834
02:50:25,799 --> 02:50:32,250
go back to grace. Go back, go back. What? What? What? Go back, go back, go back, go back,

835
02:50:32,250 --> 02:50:34,729
go back, go back, go back, go back, go back, go back, go back, go back, go back. Go back,

836
02:50:34,729 --> 02:50:43,510
go back, go back. What? Go back. All right, I'm going back. Relax. This is not even the right one.

837
02:50:51,379 --> 02:51:03,659
He fell for it. That was too many people saying go back. There's a hole in the floor.

838
02:51:04,459 --> 02:51:13,319
I don't see a hole in the floor right here. Is this a hole in the floor?

839
02:51:13,319 --> 02:51:37,829
Hole in the floor? Hey dude, yo, there's a hole in the floor. What? What? There's a hole in the

840
02:51:37,829 --> 02:51:50,260
floor? You need to go north. Is there a hole over here? Oh, a hole in the floor. I found a hole in

841
02:51:50,260 --> 02:52:14,500
the floor. Oh shit. Hole in the floor. Thank you. We did it. You guys did do it. Thank you.

842
02:52:15,219 --> 02:52:32,940
I would have just completely glossed over this. Were you in one of the boxes?

843
02:52:33,500 --> 02:52:45,959
If a rat kills me. If a rat kills me, seriously, like I have to eat a ghost pepper.

844
02:52:46,600 --> 02:53:03,450
Like, honest to god. What happened to the Paper Mario stream? Uh, yeah, I kind of just like didn't

845
02:53:03,450 --> 02:53:11,639
do it. I just like didn't really feel like it. It's so funny because, yeah guys, I'm not going

846
02:53:11,639 --> 02:53:18,280
to be streaming that often anymore. Games that are games that are more than like 30 to 40 hours,

847
02:53:18,280 --> 02:53:21,159
I'm definitely not going to be able to do them. I'm not going to really get into them.

848
02:53:22,120 --> 02:53:27,879
And now I've streamed like a hundred fucking hours of Dark of Elden Ring. So yeah, I've,

849
02:53:28,840 --> 02:53:35,959
yeah, I get it. But I'm not as passionate about Paper Mario than I am as Elden Ring. Okay.

850
02:53:37,079 --> 02:53:43,610
I don't have the real passion for Paper Mario. I think it's cool. I think it looks fun.

851
02:53:44,889 --> 02:54:07,020
Cool. It looks fun. Did it make this better? Not really. Takes way too much mana.

852
02:54:07,020 --> 02:54:17,030
Just one comet. Yeah. Why would you ever use that? I guess maybe the...

853
02:54:17,989 --> 02:54:45,620
Why is it so dark in here? I got starlight. What do I keep getting points? Oh fuck.

854
02:55:17,079 --> 02:55:42,280
Fuck you. Get that shit away. The stone sword key. Ooh. Any more of these I can open?

855
02:55:42,280 --> 02:55:54,979
I don't believe so. Damn, this guy's good. Oh fuck. I don't know. I can't cast this. I don't

856
02:55:54,979 --> 02:56:07,059
have enough mana. Wait. Yeah, I do. I can eat one of these. Use to gradually recover FP. Use.

857
02:56:07,780 --> 02:56:32,700
We're good. Oh my god. Oh. Guys, I had one hit. I'm not going to use mana.

858
02:56:33,979 --> 02:57:03,909
I can't even reach this one. There's so many here. They're not that dangerous, but I mean,

859
02:57:04,469 --> 02:57:07,430
what if I need to run down here? Someone's going to chase me down this fucking tunnel.

860
02:57:25,559 --> 02:57:38,840
Ugh. What the fuck? Not an illusion? Okay. I'm like unclogging the drain.

861
02:57:40,920 --> 02:57:51,110
I'm going to come out and there's going to be running water in the capital.

862
02:57:51,110 --> 02:58:05,239
They're going to be all clapping for me. Okay. I could go the other way too.

863
02:58:05,799 --> 02:58:40,489
What was that? Hole right there. I don't want to fall through that shit. Rainbow arrow? Wait. Dude,

864
02:58:40,489 --> 02:58:52,500
this is so... Where am I? I'm just going... I'm not even going to attack these things anymore.

865
02:58:52,500 --> 02:59:15,770
What's the point? Fuck. I need to clean up the sewers. I hope there's a on fire or something

866
02:59:15,770 --> 02:59:35,379
down here. That cast speed on that is so good now. God. Oh god. I don't like this. I don't like this

867
02:59:35,379 --> 02:59:49,530
at all. I actually don't like this at all. I got to keep starlight on call here because

868
02:59:50,899 --> 03:00:09,209
something's going to come out here. Oh no, no, no, no. Not one of these guys. Not one of these guys.

869
03:00:09,930 --> 03:00:13,209
Not one of these things. What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? Just kill it.

870
03:00:52,979 --> 03:00:55,940
Fuck you, man. I don't know how to fight you without a horse.

871
03:01:06,709 --> 03:01:08,870
Dude, why the fuck are you supposed to fight this guy?

872
03:01:23,260 --> 03:01:35,799
Shit. Oh my god. That guy's so horrible. It was like, I do even have the same... There aren't

873
03:01:35,799 --> 03:01:47,559
even enough frames to attack him before he attacks you again. I can't even call the boys.

874
03:01:47,559 --> 03:01:58,649
I can't call them. They're not available. I'm like, I don't know how to get down there again.

875
03:01:58,649 --> 03:02:15,340
It's gonna be a nightmare. Okay, so wait. There's like two ways to go. Fuck that way. That guy's

876
03:02:15,340 --> 03:02:24,680
almost impossible on foot. All right, there's two ways I could go. We're going this way.

877
03:02:25,399 --> 03:02:45,530
Remember, I baked cookies. Oh, that sounds awesome. It actually sounds incredible.

878
03:02:46,090 --> 03:02:54,760
What kind of cookies? And by the way, soft or chewy cookies. Very important.

879
03:02:55,399 --> 03:03:13,129
They just put every awful enemy in the game down here. Like, these guys are fucking worse, too.

880
03:03:20,920 --> 03:03:39,299
There goes 23 cows... cows and roos. What the fuck? I hate the hands. That was a big hand,

881
03:03:39,299 --> 03:03:42,020
too. That was just a huge hand. Do I have to kill that thing?

882
03:03:43,209 --> 03:03:48,170
Chat. Chat. Tell... Hey, chat. Tell me now. Do I have to kill that thing? Chat. Tell me now.

883
03:03:55,030 --> 03:03:58,059
I'm going that way. That guy with the crown, that goes...

884
03:03:59,020 --> 03:04:05,959
...and dashes around and teleports and does like 12 frames of attack animation when you have two

885
03:04:05,959 --> 03:04:11,559
frames that you can move. I don't want to fight that guy. I want to go down there later and kill

886
03:04:11,559 --> 03:05:04,489
him. Okay. Fucking starlight. Stay on. What? Why did he not... That's so confusing to me.

887
03:05:05,450 --> 03:05:15,479
Who's screaming? Somebody's yelling. What was that? Who's making that noise?

888
03:05:24,309 --> 03:05:33,620
I don't know. I feel like someone was just mocking me. Oh, fucking thing. Fucking

889
03:05:33,620 --> 03:05:44,940
starlight kid. Okay. So, I'm just going to go buy a lantern because I fucking don't want to keep

890
03:05:44,940 --> 03:05:58,260
casting this stupid fucking move. I mean, is it brighter? And by the way, this hand is dying now.

891
03:05:59,059 --> 03:06:05,780
I hate these enemies. It's the worst enemy in the whole game. It is the worst enemy in the game.

892
03:06:06,340 --> 03:06:11,860
I hate them. I think it's awful. I don't like the design choices around them. I think they're too

893
03:06:11,860 --> 03:06:20,260
big. I think they have too wide of an arc. Their damage hitbox is like a 250 degrees in front of

894
03:06:20,260 --> 03:06:25,579
them. They're too fast. They have way too much stamina. They're too... You know what? I don't

895
03:06:25,579 --> 03:06:28,940
just... I go to the whole fucking room. I don't even care. It's not going to happen again, is it?

896
03:06:29,899 --> 03:06:40,969
It is. Get up! Oh my god, dude. All right. All right. Is it going to kill me?

897
03:06:47,500 --> 03:07:50,059
Then, you know, if I can... Yeah, you know. What's that? I'm going to be alive. It's fine.

898
03:07:52,969 --> 03:07:57,379
Wait until I'm down to the flowers. They're blocking the fucking ladder now.

899
03:07:58,649 --> 03:08:11,219
You can't get out of the fucking way. He's got like a million health. Oh my... Why is he here?

900
03:08:12,100 --> 03:08:46,469
Stagger. I can't even hit it. I'm facing the wrong way. I knew he was going to do it.

901
03:08:48,170 --> 03:09:06,629
All right. I'm poisoned, but it's okay. I'm just going to chill for a second.

902
03:09:07,350 --> 03:09:14,069
This guy's almost dead. Like actually pretty much dead. I need to do one more cast on him.

903
03:09:14,069 --> 03:09:35,719
Worst enemy in the game, by the way. Without a question in my mind. Hey, hey! He's supposed to be

904
03:09:35,719 --> 03:10:06,729
dead. No, don't cast starlight. Get out of here. Jesus, kill it. Dude, these enemies are the hardest

905
03:10:06,729 --> 03:10:15,909
enemy for me in the game. Oh, okay. These are... Whatever. I don't care. This enemy is the bane of

906
03:10:15,909 --> 03:10:23,899
my entire existence. Use fire? I have magical spells. I don't have fire spells. I guess I could

907
03:10:23,899 --> 03:10:43,379
throw a canister at him. Okay, we're good. Jesus. Look, somebody was screaming back here. Oh,

908
03:10:43,379 --> 03:11:45,930
that's him. Throw some shit at him. Kill him. Do not kill. Don't kill him. Do not kill. Kill him.

909
03:11:47,299 --> 03:11:54,059
I am killing this motherfucker. This guy told me he was going to kill me, eat me, defile my corpse.

910
03:11:54,940 --> 03:12:03,620
This guy's dead. Don't. I'm going in there and I'm just going to fuck this. I just are wanting as

911
03:12:03,620 --> 03:12:26,739
hard as I can. Oh, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do.

912
03:12:26,739 --> 03:12:43,260
This guy's fucking weird. I don't like this guy. Leave your jail? I don't know. Should I let this

913
03:12:43,260 --> 03:13:13,579
guy out? This guy's a psycho. No, we're being bad. This is evil. I'm about to start R1ing.

914
03:13:18,920 --> 03:13:23,159
I'm about to start R1ing right now. This guy's a fucking evil maniac.

915
03:13:26,309 --> 03:13:50,180
Don't kill. Kill him. I don't want to live to live. He's going to kill somebody

916
03:13:50,819 --> 03:13:58,440
and it's going to be somebody I like. I don't like this guy. Okay. I don't like this guy,

917
03:14:02,299 --> 03:14:05,579
but I feel like it's an interesting thing that can happen. I don't know.

918
03:14:09,639 --> 03:14:13,399
I'm very curious what happens if you let this guy live. I have no idea,

919
03:14:14,360 --> 03:14:27,639
but it's terrifying. I'm having such a conflict right now, but I want to see the interesting

920
03:14:27,639 --> 03:14:35,399
thing play out or do I want to save potentially the lives of the people at the round table hold

921
03:14:35,399 --> 03:14:37,719
because he's probably going to go there and he's going to kill like three people.

922
03:14:49,850 --> 03:14:53,610
All right. I'm sticking with, we're going with pure evil route.

923
03:14:54,489 --> 03:15:02,649
Pure evil. Let's go. I did it. Pure evil route. I'm very curious what happens.

924
03:15:15,270 --> 03:15:15,670
Are you good?

925
03:15:15,909 --> 03:15:22,469
I've decided to leave the round table. I'm off in search of a noble scholar known as the gold mask

926
03:15:22,469 --> 03:15:28,950
evil to beg his instruction. We need again for some time. If there's any incantation,

927
03:15:31,750 --> 03:15:37,399
it's a work of heresy. It's incantations. There are no lineage from the tree.

928
03:15:39,180 --> 03:15:41,899
Can you stick around and help me kill this guy that's about to like rampage us here?

929
03:15:44,569 --> 03:15:47,770
Like we need to, we need to do this stick together because I let a guy out of,

930
03:15:47,770 --> 03:15:52,180
I let this guy out of prison and he's, he's going to come and kill us all. So like we,

931
03:15:52,180 --> 03:16:07,479
we should all work together. So what can I do? What were those incantations? Flame for increases

932
03:16:07,479 --> 03:16:33,829
fire damage park flame from this is, this is so old. Oh no. I'll defile you next. Come to the

933
03:16:33,829 --> 03:16:49,879
outer moat. I'm getting challenged. I'm getting challenged. Meet him out at the outer moat.

934
03:16:50,600 --> 03:17:05,530
Here's the moat outer wall, outer wall, capital. I mean, hit the moats right here. I'm going to

935
03:17:05,530 --> 03:17:41,340
assume it's this one here. I'm kind of terrified. He's not coming to get me Lake below the tree on

936
03:17:41,340 --> 03:17:55,260
the map. All right. I'm actually terrified right now below. Yep. You should really explore the top

937
03:17:55,260 --> 03:18:06,520
lift area. This is consequences. I'm actually scared. I don't know what's going to happen here.

938
03:18:07,239 --> 03:18:27,659
I thought that was him for a second. I was like, why is it coming out of the ground?

939
03:18:30,229 --> 03:18:35,979
I don't want him to kill me. No, I'm not. I'm, I'm going to try as hard as I can to not die.

940
03:18:35,979 --> 03:18:40,059
He said he was going to like defile. He's going to curse me and shit. I got to kill this guy

941
03:18:40,059 --> 03:19:51,559
first try. Is he actually going to fight me or is that bullshit? Oh no. I thought that was him for

942
03:19:51,559 --> 03:20:15,930
a second at him. Oh fuck. Oh my God. I'm off the horse. Oh my God. Get away from me. Bugs. I don't

943
03:20:15,930 --> 03:20:43,860
want to deal with a fucking bug right now. Did you say bless you? That's not fair. Wait, what?

944
03:20:43,860 --> 03:20:55,299
Why does he get a friend? Can he kill him too? Please attack him. Bless you. Oh my God. He could

945
03:20:55,299 --> 03:21:13,030
kill him. Come on. Crap friend. Kill him. Oh shit. Don't kill me. No, I can't get defiled. Oh fuck.

946
03:21:13,030 --> 03:21:33,110
Please get over here and help me. I got him. Oh, he's not dead. He's fucking dead. He's dead.

947
03:21:34,139 --> 03:21:59,719
Did I beat him? Did I get him? He was fucking easy. Sword of Milos. What happened? Don't defile me.

948
03:21:59,719 --> 03:22:12,549
Is he going to defile me? That doesn't count, right? That doesn't count. Like if I died in the

949
03:22:12,549 --> 03:22:25,590
fight, he's dead, right? I'm not going to get like a bad ending. He said if he killed me,

950
03:22:25,590 --> 03:22:36,069
that he was going to defile me and like give me a curse. I don't think that happened though,

951
03:22:36,069 --> 03:22:55,610
right? No, I'm good. All right, so I got Sword of Milos. What was that? I think it's crazy looking.

952
03:22:55,610 --> 03:23:09,299
There it is. Sword of Milos. D and D. Strength and dex. The great sword. Wow. From a giant's

953
03:23:09,299 --> 03:23:17,909
backbone. Milos was undersized for a giant and was viewed as sullied and terribly grotesque.

954
03:23:18,709 --> 03:23:42,760
The scream. Oh, that's what he was doing. I think it's cool. It's cool. This is cool.

955
03:23:43,479 --> 03:23:53,909
Wow. This is a three hit combo or R2. That's actually really good.

956
03:24:02,659 --> 03:24:08,280
Fuck over here. All right, well that was cool. So now I'm going to go.

957
03:24:09,159 --> 03:24:21,299
Can I go back to the sewer? Because that was an invader. That wasn't even him. Back to the

958
03:24:21,299 --> 03:24:45,860
round table. That sword's really cool though. All right, so what happens now? Is there something

959
03:24:45,860 --> 03:25:07,819
there? He didn't do the shrimp guy quest. I didn't. He's back. So what's the problem? What

960
03:25:07,819 --> 03:25:37,979
the fuck? I kicked the shit out of you. What?

961
03:25:42,299 --> 03:26:09,500
Wait, we're like friends now?

962
03:26:22,040 --> 03:26:25,079
Jeremy Elbertson. The dung guzzle.

963
03:26:39,290 --> 03:26:42,969
So. Yeah.

964
03:26:42,969 --> 03:27:07,780
Where is it? I have it. I own it. Where is it? First grown on a body defiled by the dung eater.

965
03:27:08,500 --> 03:27:20,329
This is one out of 99. Okay. Oh, it was nice to meet you. What is this gigantic patch on my chest?

966
03:27:21,049 --> 03:27:28,329
I haven't even looked. This is like a paper. This is like a cardboard shield that you would

967
03:27:28,329 --> 03:27:35,399
give to like a 10 year old to go dress up as a knight for Halloween. What is that? All right.

968
03:27:35,399 --> 03:27:44,620
Well anyways, that was kind of cool. There's like a bunch in the game that you've totally

969
03:27:44,620 --> 03:27:53,139
permanently missed by now. Oh, oh well. I did get some more stones. I wonder if I got enough to do

970
03:27:53,139 --> 03:28:04,549
the staff. That was cool. That was really nerve-racking. I have to go back to the sewer

971
03:28:04,549 --> 03:28:14,360
though. Or should I hold off on that and go actual game progress now? Talk to the spirit girl.

972
03:28:18,149 --> 03:28:19,239
Please take care.

973
03:28:42,420 --> 03:28:42,819
Learning.

974
03:28:47,219 --> 03:28:48,020
That's you.

975
03:28:48,020 --> 03:28:58,090
I can understand that you said it himself, actually, that I'm no mere apprentice any longer.

976
03:28:58,090 --> 03:29:05,370
Once again, I'm pleased to make your acquaintance, Moderica, the certified spirit tuner.

977
03:29:05,370 --> 03:29:11,959
Great. You did it. Nice job. Heresy. Oh, that's cool.

978
03:29:18,780 --> 03:29:24,729
All right. I can do, um, I need a somber ancient dragon smithing stone,

979
03:29:25,290 --> 03:29:33,159
but I can get this up, which is what I want to do. My, this is, it goes to s scaling with int.

980
03:29:34,200 --> 03:29:45,079
There we go. Now I'm in business. This thing is now the real deal.

981
03:29:45,719 --> 03:29:59,020
We'll talk to via via the ugly lady. Oh, I see you've had presence of the two fingers.

982
03:30:01,700 --> 03:30:17,530
Oh, yes. Seems you've talked to the two fingers. Where should I go? That's progress.

983
03:30:17,530 --> 03:30:28,889
If you would say no heat, no sin, unlocated demigods.

984
03:30:28,889 --> 03:30:30,409
There are four more demigods.

985
03:30:30,409 --> 03:30:30,909
Four?

986
03:30:36,920 --> 03:30:44,360
The undefeated swordswoman, Princess Rani, brought her to renown.

987
03:30:44,360 --> 03:30:44,860
Wait.

988
03:30:51,110 --> 03:30:52,629
Three. Because I did her quest.

989
03:30:57,319 --> 03:31:00,360
You already did Rani's quest. Yep.

990
03:31:04,340 --> 03:31:04,840
Okay.

991
03:31:09,370 --> 03:31:11,690
Hello, final boss of the game. It's you.

992
03:31:12,969 --> 03:31:16,010
I'm going to do all this work. I'm going to get all the great ruins and he's going to be like,

993
03:31:16,010 --> 03:31:20,729
oh, tarnished. Excellent work. He's going to like do like the villain walk on clap.

994
03:31:21,530 --> 03:31:25,370
And he's going to stand in front of the fucking Elden tree thing.

995
03:31:25,370 --> 03:31:28,170
And he's going to, he's the final boss. It's going to be this guy.

996
03:31:29,209 --> 03:31:31,659
Like he's going to steal my thunder because it was going to be me.

997
03:31:32,819 --> 03:31:37,940
And turns out, turns out you don't want to fucking be the Elden Lord because it's,

998
03:31:37,940 --> 03:31:42,520
it's horrible, right? And he's going to be like, what's, what's happening to me?

999
03:31:43,719 --> 03:31:46,440
And it's going to be like this horrible, horrible thing. And it's going to be like,

1000
03:31:46,440 --> 03:31:53,540
I'm glad it didn't happen to me. That's what I, that's what I think is going to happen.

1001
03:31:53,540 --> 03:31:58,780
That's my way this is going for me. That's a Disney ending.

1002
03:31:59,420 --> 03:32:10,780
Okay. Let me talk to the, uh, hug lady and then I'm going to go that way. I'm going to go,

1003
03:32:13,430 --> 03:32:19,030
I could, I could go this way or I could go over here or I didn't explore that much over here

1004
03:32:19,030 --> 03:32:25,540
either. So many places to fucking go. I haven't seen any, look at this road. This goes this way.

1005
03:32:27,930 --> 03:32:38,389
So that's interesting. Then is this way. Close the guide, please do top left. I mean, top left

1006
03:32:38,389 --> 03:32:46,860
to me, this is like the end of the game, right? Oh, go, go, go to the grand lift of rolled and

1007
03:32:46,860 --> 03:32:55,379
go, I set the tree a flame, right? That's end game stuff. I imagine. So in the meantime,

1008
03:32:55,379 --> 03:33:09,739
let me just see what else is over here and let me talk to the hug lady. This guy's pretty good.

1009
03:33:10,379 --> 03:33:33,899
Where's the hug lady? Please, would you like me to? No. Good day to you. Okay. Do I have any death

1010
03:33:33,899 --> 03:34:03,159
root? This guy. Did you need something? Idiot. Why? What? Let her hug you. No, I'll get to talk to

1011
03:34:03,159 --> 03:34:11,879
her. I don't want it. I don't want to hug her so I can get the fucking Baldi's basic blessing,

1012
03:34:11,879 --> 03:34:25,559
whatever it is. I don't, whatever. I don't know. I don't want it. You had a lantern.

1013
03:34:38,409 --> 03:34:39,530
May I ask a favor?

1014
03:34:50,170 --> 03:34:55,350
Weather dagger. What was her name?

1015
03:34:55,350 --> 03:35:01,530
It's a very precious thing. It must have a special place in the owner's heart.

1016
03:35:01,530 --> 03:35:07,610
Thanks. So I would like for the original owner to have it back if you wouldn't mind.

1017
03:35:09,129 --> 03:35:15,209
I'd like you to find the owner of the dagger. Very precious. Thanks for telling me anything.

1018
03:35:16,090 --> 03:35:19,450
You know, the most annoying part about this is instead of her just telling me what the person's

1019
03:35:19,450 --> 03:35:27,030
name is, she engraved it on the weapon and like, I have to read it. This belonged to Godric,

1020
03:35:27,270 --> 03:35:33,190
Godric the Brave. Okay. Yeah. And he resides in Castle Fortnite. Like you, she just can't tell

1021
03:35:33,190 --> 03:35:38,700
me that. Like just tell, why do I have to read the engraving? To a certain someone.

1022
03:35:39,500 --> 03:35:45,819
He wishes for it to return to his rightful owner. It was once a special weapon of gold and silver

1023
03:35:45,819 --> 03:35:51,819
intertwined but is now worn down and marred. Okay, it doesn't say it on it. I don't know

1024
03:35:51,819 --> 03:36:08,040
who this belongs to. I thought it said Fortnite grave. Oh, I have this poison, right? Small flask

1025
03:36:08,040 --> 03:36:14,040
from syllabus containing a cloudy tonic. It's going to, it's poison. Find Nepheli and ensure

1026
03:36:14,040 --> 03:36:20,469
that she, no, you have, didn't we come across this person? I feel like I know who that person is,

1027
03:36:20,469 --> 03:36:37,860
but I don't know where they are now. The person's dead. Wait, they are? Wait, it's this person's

1028
03:36:37,860 --> 03:36:48,459
dagger? Why can't you just walk in the other room? Why not just, okay, it's like somebody's car keys.

1029
03:36:49,260 --> 03:36:53,819
I found a pair of car keys. Does this belong to anybody? Oh shit, yeah, yeah, that's mine. Is

1030
03:36:53,819 --> 03:37:33,700
that for Subaru? Like how come I have to do this? Okay, now what? Rest. This motherfucker's gone.

1031
03:37:35,049 --> 03:37:37,370
It's gone. Okay, so did you see where he went?

1032
03:37:50,069 --> 03:38:14,700
I'm missing some context. What happened? You all right? Why are you telling me this?

1033
03:38:15,340 --> 03:38:21,020
It's on Mount Gilmere off the old leads west from the town of windmills.

1034
03:38:21,020 --> 03:38:31,930
That is the contact. They killed his friend. Just you wait. Oh, okay. So where's, um,

1035
03:38:32,889 --> 03:38:44,629
where's this, where's this guy? All right, um, eat this blessing. I don't want it on me anymore.

1036
03:38:45,350 --> 03:39:07,049
So now it's time. I have the options now. He's still here. Is it? Oh, you would use

1037
03:39:07,049 --> 03:39:16,680
he was talking a lot of shit about you. Oh, no, I like this guy. This guy gave me my first weapon.

1038
03:39:16,680 --> 03:39:25,209
Remember he gave me the plus eight rip here. I like this guy. That's sad. He's like one of

1039
03:39:25,209 --> 03:39:31,700
my favorite NPCs. He helped us so early. Remember how excited I was to get that weapon?

1040
03:39:41,819 --> 03:39:53,850
Where? Okay, so you say he's still here down here. Maybe it's all the same. He's saying he's still

1041
03:39:53,850 --> 03:40:35,079
here. Blind one prayer assassin's prayer book got faith faith faith faith faith.

1042
03:40:35,879 --> 03:40:43,670
You know what I mean? So where is he? He said, I can't see the blind blind blind.

1043
03:40:44,229 --> 03:41:08,229
What the fuck happened? What happened? Why is he dead? What? Finally, it is returned to its

1044
03:41:08,309 --> 03:41:20,139
rightful place of the exalted noble. I must bid you goodbye as well. Though I ask you deliver

03:44:47,979 --> 03:44:55,879
voices of the tormented spirits are silent again but it isn't my last time most certain

1059
03:44:57,049 --> 03:45:03,700

1070
03:47:01,399 --> 03:47:08,409
herma only reads every other sentence in the item descriptions i also take every other step up a

1071
03:47:08,409 --> 03:47:27,430
staircase as well so i mean i i kind of do that i do every other step i go two steps at a time

1074
03:48:02,459 --> 03:48:20,260

1076
03:48:31,260 --> 03:48:45,559
need to get up here around here all right i no longer give a shit about uh about one because

1077
03:48:45,559 --> 03:48:50,120
that's gonna be like a memory stone i don't care right that's gonna be like a turtle puzzle

1078
03:48:50,440 --> 03:48:57,559
with a memory stone in it i don't want that i don't care about that we can go ahead and take

1079
03:48:57,559 --> 03:49:08,620
that off the list it was four i don't care yeah i'm not even using all the memory stone slots

1080
03:49:08,620 --> 03:49:13,750
in the first place all right now that's somewhere that i want to go we're going there first

1081
03:49:14,469 --> 03:49:51,430
this looks like a church probably sacred tier probably please don't die definitely nice sacred

1082
03:49:51,430 --> 03:50:03,030
tier yeah that's exactly what i wanted i really needed it mog related enemy monk s

1083
03:50:07,049 --> 03:50:38,540
haha mog related the extended mog family what's going on down there uh i do i do want to go here

1084
03:50:39,739 --> 03:51:06,120
basically any blood enemy is mog like i guess so what's that what's going on what was that do

1085
03:51:06,120 --> 03:51:25,690
you see that it was weird what was that weird like sprinklies what's going on here what was

1086
03:51:25,690 --> 03:51:36,680
it you see you saw that i don't know what was that for it was like a tube of uh of sparklies

1087
03:51:36,680 --> 03:52:27,819
what's up what's up what's up what's going on here okay what is going on right now

1088
03:52:32,969 --> 03:52:47,959
uh okay i think i just did something yeah i got him i got him i don't know what that was for

1089
03:52:47,959 --> 03:52:56,500
necessarily but it's it's okay it's you have to break the three seals and then the memory it's

1090
03:52:56,500 --> 03:53:27,700

1102
03:56:35,700 --> 03:56:40,739
to do okay me strong is not gonna get very many quests so we're gonna give him some of these

1103
03:56:40,739 --> 03:56:54,229
things that he would be interested in doing now there's one right in front of the tower

1104
03:56:54,229 --> 03:57:05,579
it's one right here right in front of it no right here i already got the tower one i did

1105
03:57:05,579 --> 03:57:20,260
so there's one by the bridge okay so that's the one by the crumbling bridge okay okay it's over

1106
03:57:20,260 --> 03:57:34,840
here it's like right here somewhere all right you got that one you already got that one so

1107
03:57:35,559 --> 03:58:17,139
it's not going away don't worry let's do this this thing hostile i guess probably there's probably

1108
03:58:17,139 --> 03:58:22,469
a dungeon here that's pretty cool all right looking for a dungeon i'm not gonna kill all

1109
03:58:22,469 --> 03:58:34,600
these things what about this way that was the horror actually kind of looked like it yeah

1110
03:58:37,690 --> 03:58:40,729
all right there's that but hold on let me see if there's anything around the corner

1111
03:58:40,729 --> 03:59:11,450
i'm a big fan of the dungeons i love them okay all right uh i don't see anything else the blood

1112
03:59:11,450 --> 03:59:18,540
dogs oh okay we're just going for this we're just we're just going for it all right let's

1113
03:59:18,540 --> 03:59:39,690
go for it we're going for it whatever's in here let's do it sanguine noble oh wow you're gonna die

1114
03:59:39,690 --> 04:00:18,010
very quickly that was not a mog type enemy bloody helus there's some really cool weapons in this

1115
04:00:18,010 --> 04:00:30,309
area arcane and dex and it's a thrusting sword oh that's what he was using designed to bore into

1116
04:00:30,309 --> 04:00:36,809
flesh causing severe blood loss at the wound the extracted blood trickles gracefully down the length

1117
04:00:36,809 --> 04:00:43,860
of the blade nimbly avoid an attack securing some distance from foes follow up with a strong attack

1118
04:00:43,860 --> 04:00:52,760
before we start to lunge and press strong attack again do it again this thing's really cool all

1119
04:00:52,760 --> 04:00:57,909
right this is the only uh rip here that i would actually use in the game this is actually really

1120
04:00:57,909 --> 04:01:21,979
cool does that have eye frames damn that's really cool all right so that's arcane and dex which

1121
04:01:21,979 --> 04:01:28,010
i mean still got baby rattle but you know it's good to say to see the other stuff that's cool

1122
04:01:28,010 --> 04:01:41,260
that's fun that weapon is being used for speed running you know after i finish this game i

1123
04:01:41,260 --> 04:01:46,540
definitely want to check out the speed runs because i'm really curious how you do it because you can

1124
04:01:46,540 --> 04:01:52,950
go pretty much anywhere you want in the open world right you just get on the horses go but do they

1125
04:01:52,950 --> 04:02:04,069
just ride to the final boss somehow there's a lot of warp skips 28 minutes currently they use

1126
04:02:04,069 --> 04:02:10,229
warps and then just run to the final boss i wonder that's i'm so curious eventually

1127
04:02:10,950 --> 04:02:23,819
okay that was cool i can go this way there's an all remembrance run that's probably cool too all

1128
04:02:23,819 --> 04:02:38,579
right so here we go we're on the road here that's nothing nothing in here really all right so there

1129
04:02:38,579 --> 04:02:44,899
was somebody here right there's a a remembrance soul or something right isn't that guy talking

1130
04:02:44,899 --> 04:03:02,729
about it wow you got a funny story let me tell you something i don't not right now mount gelmere

1131
04:03:03,690 --> 04:03:24,389
very cool one of these what do i add plus um plus eight i'm imagining this probably plus 10

1132
04:03:25,190 --> 04:03:34,709
plus 15 all right let's take it in let's see what we got man this is a whole nother area this is

1133
04:03:34,709 --> 04:03:44,569
an entire another zone isn't it what the fuck have you ever attempted a soul level one run no

1134
04:03:45,530 --> 04:03:55,979
oh i don't have the skill to be able to do that one of those what's it fighting

1135
04:03:58,600 --> 04:04:33,209
get advantage point hi these guys kind of suck but i will help you fight it

1136
04:04:46,229 --> 04:05:13,299
yo 777 all right that's dead okay what's been your favorite boss so far you know weirdly enough i

1137
04:05:13,299 --> 04:05:20,100
complained about him a lot but it's probably gaudric you see he had the most personality i

1138
04:05:20,100 --> 04:05:38,219
think he the best music and the best personality so far all right is that why do you have the dunce

1139
04:05:38,219 --> 04:05:41,340
cap on because it gives me extra intelligence and it doesn't make me look like a weirdo like

1140
04:05:41,340 --> 04:05:55,799
the other one does progress i don't i don't have to kill these guys or anything but worth at least

1141
04:05:55,799 --> 04:06:09,270
looking around anything else on the edges check always check the edges it might be a dungeon

1142
04:06:09,270 --> 04:06:22,200
awesome radan lore is pretty cool so you guys saying they patched him what happened

1143
04:06:30,360 --> 04:06:43,559
oh go go go go go go go go oh my god oh i'm in trouble holy shit why is it five people here

1144
04:06:43,559 --> 04:07:08,059
three of them so what do they do it does way less damage now okay i wonder how much less is way less

1145
04:07:08,700 --> 04:07:20,020
what was that ladder over here oh my soul's on the ground so i can't use that as a marker

1146
04:07:20,739 --> 04:07:38,040
it's like right here right hurry up allegedly 40 less range on his swings holy shit

1147
04:07:39,000 --> 04:07:46,889
that's actually a huge deal that's a big deal you beat him before the patch you get bragging rights

1148
04:07:47,530 --> 04:07:56,139
i mean i'll be honest i i kind of don't care about the bragging rights i fucking hated that fight

1149
04:07:56,860 --> 04:08:04,340
like i almost wish i didn't fight it until post patch so i didn't like lose two years off of my

1150
04:08:04,340 --> 04:08:24,280
life he's a cool fight he is a cool fight but fuck that fight just wait i yeah i know there's like

1151
04:08:24,280 --> 04:08:35,979
another fight later or soon that's like good luck but i think i'm gonna go i'm gonna go i'm

1152
04:08:35,979 --> 04:08:44,700
at level 100 right that's a pretty good place to be but most of the um somewhere around like 120 to

1153
04:08:44,700 --> 04:08:57,420
130 140 is like kind of the end of the video game in quotes something like that right 150

1154
04:08:59,659 --> 04:09:17,719
wait till 150 150 120 what's going on are you hostile what are you doing stop don't do that

1155
04:09:18,440 --> 04:09:34,170
okay i'm sorry it was like lying with your friend i felt bad for that i beat it around 135 135

1156
04:09:40,280 --> 04:09:43,959
i think most people are in like the 110 to 140 range from what i've

1157
04:09:44,680 --> 04:09:59,719
heard i don't want to go too too far over level though right that's why i mean i there's tons of

1158
04:09:59,719 --> 04:10:13,100
stuff i could probably do and explore but i i'm kind of afraid of just leveling up a ton 140 to

1159
04:10:13,100 --> 04:10:24,459
150 is average for late game okay so i'm not i'm not concerned about it then there's a whole

1160
04:10:24,459 --> 04:10:44,540
other way to go down there those birds are gonna come down aren't they yeah they are yes they are

1161
04:10:45,340 --> 04:10:52,260

1162
04:10:52,260 --> 04:11:02,149

04:43:37,979 --> 04:43:45,540
talkies are amazing to me trader joe's makes an unbelievable talkies rip off and they're way better

04:43:47,130 --> 04:43:51,450
honestly i like the doritos ones the doritos ones that just a straight up copy of talkies

1282
04:43:51,450 --> 04:43:56,779
i think are better but i'm serious like the trader joe's ones are the way that they should be

1283
04:44:07,580 --> 04:44:11,180
that's usually true yeah i'm saying i'm telling you if you like love talkies

1365
05:16:13,740 --> 05:16:22,599
is up there right yeah that's what i would assume all right so i got this map now which is this is

1366
05:16:22,599 --> 05:16:30,250
crazy that there's even another area too all right look at all this shit to do look at all this look

1367
05:16:30,250 --> 05:16:36,700
at all this stuff you can't know what you can't even do in one lifetime that's where i died this

1368
05:16:36,700 --> 05:16:42,680
is where i am now all right so look this is like shit over here to explore ruins and all right

1369
05:16:45,580 --> 05:17:12,139
horse in pouch bro huh i'm actually kind of surprised that it took me this long to do that

1370
05:17:13,099 --> 05:17:22,549
i think that's all i need look at all these ruins too i'm not crushing any of them all right

1371
05:17:24,060 --> 05:17:31,529
oh finally it only took 80 in-game hours now let's start the process i went this way i want to go

1372
05:17:32,490 --> 05:17:36,250
there's like a probably a side door let's do side entrance we're gonna do side entrance

1373
05:17:36,810 --> 05:17:59,659
probably side entrance i don't even need to fight these guys fuck them oh yikes

1374
05:18:02,040 --> 05:18:18,069
no side entrance what's down here this guy is huge oh man he's like a giant one of these things

1375
05:18:26,900 --> 05:18:43,930
oh don't you know what we're gonna go ahead and do this oh that was weird he just went so fast

1376
05:18:44,729 --> 05:19:21,619
all right that was pretty fun a larval tier oh oh this is the burnt urn tree this is really

1377
05:19:21,619 --> 05:19:38,180
interesting i wonder why this is like this what the heck i'm getting immersed one of these guys is

1378
05:19:38,180 --> 05:20:49,110
down here oh fuck you oh what don't get cocky you idiot

1379
05:21:02,090 --> 05:21:38,889
fuck you i hit him what is going on what did he just do why did he do that oh shit in my fucking

1380
05:21:38,889 --> 05:21:58,979
pants fine i'm fine i'm fine i got plenty of health get out of here i have enough experience

1381
05:21:58,979 --> 05:22:10,630
fighting those guys that's like the fourth one i thought oh leaden and what do those do

1382
05:22:11,189 --> 05:22:32,150
eliminates all fp consumption what i drink that and just spam spells um i kind of feel like i need

1383
05:22:32,150 --> 05:22:49,270
that it seems unbelievably that that seems like game breaking how good that is that's god tier

1384
05:22:49,990 --> 05:23:10,790
you can summon any spirit for free jesus okay that's cool anything behind the urn tree

1385
05:23:17,750 --> 05:23:27,830
oh that was pretty cool though i will say i the i fought that worm spirit ulcerated free sap

1386
05:23:27,830 --> 05:23:36,099
thing like five times though i have lots of experience and where are we going i'm heading

1387
05:23:36,099 --> 05:23:50,380
this way now i don't know what this is what happened here is that the manner i think i would

1388
05:23:50,380 --> 05:24:03,290
say this is the volcano manner i'm gonna yeah i want to do the manner you saw the front door

1389
05:24:03,290 --> 05:24:12,500
yeah yeah okay so i'll go back up i want to put that on too the manners right here

1390
05:24:12,500 --> 05:24:24,950
yeah getting lost is the best part of the game yeah i know absolutely it is oh this is wrong

1391
05:24:24,950 --> 05:24:36,259
but whatever i want to put that flask on okay the the you don't take damage for one hit is huge

1392
05:24:36,259 --> 05:24:52,180
so i feel like this is going to be insane very interested it only lasts for 10 seconds so

1393
05:24:52,819 --> 05:25:00,650
you drink it and just spam a move just spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam and then be done

1394
05:25:00,650 --> 05:25:13,450
with it lord ryckhard this putrid field of death is what your blasphemy would bring

1395
05:25:13,450 --> 05:25:31,939
then i can no longer abide no one can what happened this way where's bugleberry these things

1396
05:25:31,939 --> 05:25:42,389
i'm just going to the front door i actually despise that enemy uh where is the wait where's the front

1397
05:25:42,389 --> 05:25:56,599
door am i going the wrong way up and around right yeah there's a big guy standing in front of the

1398
05:25:56,599 --> 05:26:05,529
front door i don't remember where that was we don't wait is it right there i can't make that jump

1399
05:26:05,529 --> 05:26:22,540

1403
05:27:35,110 --> 05:28:02,040
stream go any lower please stop these guys are so much easier with magic i can imagine

1404
05:28:03,369 --> 05:28:12,250
being a strict melee character here uh it's probably hell and potentially like five to

1405
05:28:12,250 --> 05:28:32,900
ten levels ago right yes five to ten what is the all right what would you guys say the like the

1406
05:28:32,900 --> 05:28:47,959
sole level of this area is 90 85 90 a little higher maybe 80 80 to 90 okay so i mean i'm not

1407
05:28:48,680 --> 05:28:55,740
i'm a little over leveled for this area but not like egregiously more around 90

1408
05:28:59,060 --> 05:29:09,830
i thought this is a mountain of fire but i hardly feel a thing i'll then what you're fine pretty

1409
05:29:09,830 --> 05:29:41,139
much level wise yeah it feels that way oh lots of buds okay that's interesting all right let's

1410
05:29:41,139 --> 05:29:54,790
head in the manor oh oh this place is cool looks like resident evil oh good thing i got starlight

05:30:09,909 --> 05:30:14,380
a secret wall if it's a secret wall and you don't know where it is i'm probably gonna miss it

05:30:15,099 --> 05:30:42,939
volcano manor i like this place a lot this place is so this place is cool it's kind of like a

1449
05:39:42,729 --> 05:39:52,569
to your doubts i wonder is blasphemy and leads only to a miserable death before you consider

1450
05:39:52,569 --> 05:40:01,340
hunting any of your own kind think on that this blasphemous path leads only to a pitiful death

1451
05:40:02,060 --> 05:40:08,380
before you consider hunting any of your own kind think on all right well i i know you

1454
05:40:30,169 --> 05:40:36,330
you're wondering about lania well you see i after much internal debate i've come to realize

1455
05:40:36,970 --> 05:40:43,450
revenge is not the answer according to lady tannith i've got the stuff of champions oh and

1456
05:40:43,450 --> 05:40:49,529
champions ironic as it is are oft forced to walk okay let me tell you man it hit me like a bolt

1457
05:40:49,529 --> 05:40:55,369
from the blue we should just bolt my former thoughts were simple naivety of course my heart

1458
05:40:55,369 --> 05:41:00,169
weeps for lania we should get out of here incident was a cruel twist of fate indeed

1459
05:41:01,049 --> 05:41:04,889
you're starting to believe your own bullshit here cause won't make me a champion will it

1460
05:41:05,450 --> 05:41:12,090
lania knows this i'm certain fate has laid hard roads for us both you're starting to believe

1461
05:41:12,090 --> 05:41:18,490
your own bullshit and that's not good trod by champions all right man i always resented these

1462
05:41:18,490 --> 05:41:25,689
hands their pale complexion a far cry from any warriors the shame of house hoslow but that won't

1463
05:41:25,689 --> 05:41:31,209

1555
06:00:16,250 --> 06:00:25,900
all right now recusant just like you recusants have particular battle arts styled to our methods

1556
06:00:25,900 --> 06:00:45,400
of slaughter why not add some to your repertoire oh very interesting sassin's gambit grants grants

1557
06:00:45,400 --> 06:00:56,139
near invisibility and silent footsteps eruption storm blade this is no skill very cool you've

1558
06:00:56,139 --> 06:01:02,299
come to understand now to take power and make it his own the recusant must hunt his own kind

1559
06:01:02,299 --> 06:01:07,900
to raise the flag of revolt against this sanctified pillaging we recusants must become the most

1560
06:01:07,900 --> 06:01:15,430
wretched of predators all you can do is laugh all right so you sell those what about you have you

1561
06:01:15,430 --> 06:01:21,029
killed anybody i always resented these had a pale complexion but that won't be there'll be darker

1562
06:01:22,229 --> 06:01:30,180
any more notes any more letters i can pick up what about you strange sounds here at the manor

1563
06:01:30,180 --> 06:01:40,169
yeah there's snakes in the walls like breathing slithering scales oh it just is impossible

1564
06:01:40,810 --> 06:01:48,419
okay so yeah that's how you find out like breathing all right that sounds cool what

1565
06:01:48,419 --> 06:01:57,900
about the uh talk to the yeah the lady over here did you read the letter left for you that is the

1566
06:01:57,900 --> 06:02:03,580
task the volcano manor desires you and i did it you will be compensated once the deed is done

1567
06:02:04,540 --> 06:02:10,540
amy if you are loathed to hunt your own kin so be it but you must leave this house at once

1568
06:02:10,540 --> 06:02:16,700
this is a war against the earth tree we have no place for the meek nor the luxury of keeping

1569
06:02:16,700 --> 06:02:24,180
clean ham amy i did it you've completed your tire am pleased now you are a recusant true

1570
06:02:24,979 --> 06:02:30,900
and a full-fledged member of the volcano manor this is your reward as promised

1571
06:02:32,819 --> 06:02:43,779
you got faith bullshit never forget that the recusant fights to tread the path of the champion

1572
06:02:44,419 --> 06:02:54,549
the way is tainted but for this very reason it is the true path to valor give me more faith

1573
06:02:54,549 --> 06:03:04,869
cool faith stuff rounded in my face yeah it is faith it's any 10 faith why is a lump of magma

1574
06:03:09,130 --> 06:03:16,340
sorceries i need to put a guys i have to put four points in faith that's not happening

1575
06:03:19,299 --> 06:03:26,709
or that's gonna cost like 400 000 souls you put a talisman on to do it yeah but i don't want to do

1576
06:03:26,709 --> 06:03:36,700
that i'll test it out maybe okay so now all right so you're gonna give me another task when i

1577
06:03:36,700 --> 06:03:56,970
reload the area looking forward to fighting that guy because you know i am please kill him

1578
06:03:58,439 --> 06:04:15,340
that horrendous serpent greater ryker you're tarnished here to put the demigods to the sword

1579
06:04:15,340 --> 06:04:21,819
why is he like this then please just spoiled it is it

1580
06:04:30,709 --> 06:04:39,619
the tarnished brandish the spear and run him through the great serpent all right so where is it

1581
06:04:40,580 --> 06:04:42,150
in the lord's chamber

1582
06:04:45,270 --> 06:04:48,709
have you killed someone i haven't heard an enemy in probably 30 minutes

1583
06:04:54,099 --> 06:05:03,990
that's that one guy once he gave himself to the serpent whatever that thing is it is no longer

1584
06:05:03,990 --> 06:05:13,580
praetor right someone must kill him to spare him okay so the big snake ate this guy and he

1585
06:05:13,580 --> 06:05:21,900
is now like in the lord's chamber is a spear where's the lord's chamber

1586
06:05:22,619 --> 06:05:32,360
how do i get in it the lord's chamber it is the all right where's the lord's chamber

1587
06:05:33,240 --> 06:05:45,159
is it this door over here okay well i'm going to imagine and imagine here that

1588
06:05:45,959 --> 06:05:52,009
i'm going to imagine that that's something that i get after doing all the assassin requests

1589
06:05:53,220 --> 06:06:08,950
it's a guess but i don't know we're just gonna go that way and i'm gonna walk on the rooftops

1590
06:06:08,950 --> 06:06:14,970
it was a letter i'll go i'll do it later i want to i want to i want to walk around

1591
06:06:15,610 --> 06:06:36,380
i'm very i want to explore this don't even think about poisoning me

1592
06:06:36,380 --> 06:06:54,380
okay you can't you can't do the boss before the assassinations that's what i figured but

1593
06:06:54,380 --> 06:06:58,619
you know i'm sure there's gonna be bonfires all over the place and i can teleport to other bonfires

1594
06:06:58,619 --> 06:07:22,250
and finish up i just this area is so cool i want to see it i was way too late on that

1595
06:07:26,099 --> 06:08:02,229
shit these guys don't even do it again and you almost just got grabbed again no such a

1596
06:08:02,229 --> 06:08:04,869
fighting this guy up on this ledge sucks because like i don't want to fall off the edge

1597
06:08:13,369 --> 06:08:55,419
oh i thought he was gonna get back pain in the ass very cool i could go around the rooftops

1598
06:08:55,419 --> 06:09:20,790
and you know what that's exactly what i'm gonna do good fuck i'm overwhelmed um that way that way

1599
06:09:20,790 --> 06:09:26,250
that way that way that way okay there's like four ways to go let's just go i'm gonna just

1600
06:09:26,250 --> 06:09:53,430
walk around the perimeter i think he loves this game i do it's just it's so good but it's

1601
06:09:54,389 --> 06:10:11,979
no i want that i don't care i'm going down now who the fuck are you it looks like we're going

1602
06:10:11,979 --> 06:10:28,709
down great omen killer cleaver so many weapons how do you even pick one to play with you know

1603
06:10:28,709 --> 06:10:46,569
what i mean how are you supposed to pick one of these oh there it is blood loss strengthen decks

1604
06:10:47,209 --> 06:10:57,689
hideous horns cause blood loss adding vibrant colors to the ongoing mayhem all right well

1605
06:10:57,689 --> 06:11:13,110
it looks like we're gonna do ground level first you have 58 int why don't you have any good

1606
06:11:13,110 --> 06:11:20,970
sorcery uh because this character is kind of a little bit of sorcery a little bit sprinkled in

1607
06:11:21,529 --> 06:11:26,250
it's mostly int weapon scaling damage i wanted i wanted to swing an int weapon

1608
06:11:27,049 --> 06:11:36,840
grocery spine i use it sometimes i have a lot of cool spells free uh pre-pump or pre-patch

1609
06:11:37,400 --> 06:11:42,680
i didn't really want to use it too often like a lot of the spells i was finding were uh was it was

1610
06:11:43,000 --> 06:11:51,369
that were dog shit um there's like three moves that i actually like to use uh so i'm sure there's

1611
06:11:51,369 --> 06:12:07,819
others build is fine yeah i mean i i wanted okay here's the thing when i first played uh from

1612
06:12:07,819 --> 06:12:16,939
software games for the most part my first playthrough is fucking my god i'm gonna fucking shit my pants

1613
06:12:18,650 --> 06:12:26,680
these dogs seriously um what was i saying i okay i usually like to do a melee build

1614
06:12:27,479 --> 06:12:34,200
at least like a not 80 to 90 percent melee um i feel like it's helps me learn the game a little

1615
06:12:34,200 --> 06:12:50,090
better oh make no mistake about it i will absolutely this is cool though i will absolutely make

1616
06:12:50,090 --> 06:13:02,490
characters that are just 100 faith or 100 sorcery and just don't even fucking swing a weapon okay

1617
06:13:02,490 --> 06:13:15,979
what about up here because i don't fucking use those i am bird tree seal what is that by the way

1618
06:13:15,979 --> 06:13:21,959

1619
06:13:21,959 --> 06:13:31,259
not understanding why that's happening but i'm just it's it is for some reason where is it what i

1622

1636
06:18:42,310 --> 06:18:53,880

1637
06:18:54,919 --> 06:19:05,779
that's a sorcery move that actually scales off of intelligence so like i'm i am casting a spell

1638

like 50 and really good at the game don't get caught up in this all right what was in here

1654
06:23:42,970 --> 06:24:01,689
this is a stone sword key all right plus one greatly increases maximum stamina i mean health

1655

1656
06:24:34,729 --> 06:24:57,819
all right where did i want to go i'm just running by this after this you guys are horrible

1657
06:24:57,819 --> 06:25:02,860
hell didn't ring hell didn't ring i bought this game and i'm starting to regret it let me help you

1658
06:25:02,860 --> 06:25:14,650
here um you should you got okay these guys here you got these summoning spirits use them all the

1659
06:25:14,650 --> 06:25:22,709
time whenever you can don't stop saying refund the game come on uh you got summoning to help

1660
06:25:23,669 --> 06:25:29,029
don't feel like okay let's say you're let's say you're reliably getting a boss down to like

1661
06:25:29,669 --> 06:25:34,869
30 health after using all your flasks so you okay let's say you have like four or five six

1662
06:25:34,869 --> 06:25:40,150
glass right you drink drink you're trying so hard after like 20 30 attempts you're getting

1663
06:25:40,150 --> 06:25:46,310
the boss down to like 30 i mean like so he has 70 help remaining what i would advise you to do

1664
06:25:47,270 --> 06:25:56,490
is don't worry about the boss forget about the boss turn around and go here don't go i mean i'm

1665
06:25:56,490 --> 06:25:59,849
assuming maybe you're here maybe you're like doing this shit here maybe you're fighting market or

1666
06:25:59,849 --> 06:26:06,729
something right turn around and like go over here and go fight this stuff go over here explore

1667
06:26:06,729 --> 06:26:15,860
fort hey west check out the urn trees go level up five to ten times and then you'll come back here

1668
06:26:15,860 --> 06:26:19,299
and after like you know sometimes it takes like three or four plus five plus hours right

1669
06:26:19,939 --> 06:26:24,979
i wouldn't i wouldn't say grind i don't think grind is the right word i think the right word is

1670
06:26:26,229 --> 06:26:33,020
go play the game and if you're getting stuck on something there's no reason to continue to suffer

1671
06:26:34,360 --> 06:26:41,400
go play go find a go find a dungeon and just go clear it they're much easier than the actual

1672
06:26:41,400 --> 06:26:53,080
all right so for instance like murk water cave is 100 times easier than fighting market 100 times

1673
06:26:53,080 --> 06:27:02,569
easier another thing i'll give you for a tip because i mean i'm an elden ring streamer right

1674
06:27:02,569 --> 06:27:06,090
i mean i'm an elden ring streamer this is this is what i i'm going to give you advice

1675
06:27:07,720 --> 06:27:13,639
another thing you should take into consideration is you need to start to understand never mind what

1676
06:27:13,639 --> 06:27:23,349
am i going to say you need to understand iframes so what that means is i feel like i'm making the

1677
06:27:23,349 --> 06:27:29,959
spy fucking like ambassador video again and like years later people were like wow dude this is like

1678
06:27:29,959 --> 06:27:39,619
dogshit advice i hope nobody listened to you and i'm like okay that's right you need to learn iframes

1679
06:27:39,619 --> 06:27:42,819
what that means is you are completely invincible your character cannot get hurt

1680
06:27:43,619 --> 06:27:50,659
even a centimeter of your health right now now now some people have these swings where you you're

1681
06:27:50,659 --> 06:27:56,759
you're trying to get hit when you're invincible don't think about getting away i gotta get away

1682
06:27:56,759 --> 06:28:03,880
from this guy no you want to get near that guy you want to when he's swinging you want to get hit

1683
06:28:03,880 --> 06:28:15,020
by the sword when you are invincible get it it's not about getting away it's about getting hit

1684
06:28:15,020 --> 06:28:22,680
when you are invincible and now watch me not do that over and over again but it's this theory

1685
06:28:23,319 --> 06:28:33,939
there's a lot of hairs okay i know that like oh man we're all like man we're all from software

1686
06:28:33,939 --> 06:28:39,380
buds we're all from software fucking chums we i got like 6 000 hours there's a lot of people

1687
06:28:39,380 --> 06:28:43,779
that they literally just got this game for the first time and they have never played a from

1688
06:28:43,779 --> 06:28:52,139
software game ever you know we how about the new players we okay don't you guys understand

1689
06:28:52,779 --> 06:29:00,009
that the more people care about this stuff the more like money that comes in the more that from

1690
06:29:00,009 --> 06:29:06,619
software gets to keep making cool stuff like this think about it right more more companies will make

1691
06:29:06,619 --> 06:29:14,060
games like this it won't just be 5 000 markers on a fucking goddamn open world minimap that is just

1692
06:29:14,060 --> 06:29:19,259
go touch this thing in the world and that's literally it if we get more shit like this the

1693
06:29:19,259 --> 06:29:26,330
more people care about it there's still 500 000 people still playing this except these new players

1694
06:29:26,330 --> 06:29:32,169
they're they'll they let them and it's gonna be hard and the game sucks you're gonna be pissed but

1695
06:29:32,169 --> 06:29:42,729
you'll get it you'll get it eventually you will and you'll feel happy about it where am i okay i

1696
06:29:42,729 --> 06:29:50,500
got it so now let me go in here kind of it kind of changes the design though since they can't afford

1697
06:29:50,500 --> 06:29:57,930
to take as many risks um i i don't know i mean that's what people have been saying i remember

1698
06:29:57,930 --> 06:30:03,209
when dark souls 3 came out and everybody was like oh fuck here we go uh here come the normies

1699
06:30:03,209 --> 06:30:07,770
they're gonna start playing it because it's like a popular thing now and that game kicked my fucking

1700
06:30:07,770 --> 06:30:14,599
ass that was one of the hardest games ever played and then they made sekiro and the same thing oh

1701
06:30:14,599 --> 06:30:21,880
god i saw the trailer here come the normies now it's gonna be ruined sekiro is gonna be fucking

1702
06:30:21,880 --> 06:30:26,439
easy it's gonna be the simplest game ever activision's publishing it it's gonna be

1703
06:30:26,680 --> 06:30:28,919
you're gonna have like you're gonna have like 10 extra lives

1704
06:30:29,639 --> 06:30:34,569
securito was one of the hardest things i've ever done my whole life that was actually the hardest

1705
06:30:34,569 --> 06:30:40,250
game i've ever played it was un-fucking- believably difficult it was unbearable unbearable at times

1706
06:30:41,369 --> 06:30:48,380
and then this came out and now let me before i say anything do i think that this game is harder

1707
06:30:48,380 --> 06:30:56,939
than sekiro no i don't i think this game is as hard as you want it to be because of the open

1708
06:30:57,020 --> 06:31:04,060
world nature of it because you are allowed to go wherever you want sekiro will go down for me as

1709
06:31:04,060 --> 06:31:11,580
probably this i'm talking sekiro will go down that's probably the hardest thing i've ever done

1710
06:31:12,650 --> 06:31:21,049
truly um but this game is i would say you can say it's accessible right but it's only as hard as

1711
06:31:21,049 --> 06:31:27,740
it's only as easy as you're going to make it you can there's no like easy mode right just

1712
06:31:27,740 --> 06:31:33,419
you don't start the game and go oh yeah i'm gonna play on a normal casual experience where you know

1713
06:31:33,419 --> 06:31:38,779
you have a good time and uh the story plays out and no you have to learn how to make the game

1714
06:31:38,779 --> 06:31:45,099
easier the game's not gonna tell you how to make it easier but you can um and if you need to level

1715
06:31:45,099 --> 06:31:52,220
up a few more times and whatever who cares that's not a big deal if you get enjoyment out of you

1716
06:31:52,220 --> 06:31:57,020
know coming here at soul level like 60 or 70 damn that's gonna be fucking hard why are you still

1717
06:31:57,020 --> 06:32:09,430
talking you're stun locked i've been just rambling but what i'm a streamer well i'm literally live

1718
06:32:09,430 --> 06:32:17,909
streaming right now you what i'm not supposed to talk you are i'm literally live streaming right

1719
06:32:21,880 --> 06:32:28,889
fucking style i'd get um but do i think this game could be the hardest one it could be i think the

1720
06:32:28,889 --> 06:32:34,650
bosses though so far have been some of the hardest when you fight them at the you know current like

1721
06:32:34,650 --> 06:32:41,580
on a level that you're supposed to be in quotes but i think this is this is probably the most

1722
06:32:41,580 --> 06:32:50,060
enjoyable of the from software games i truly believe that if you want to play a game that's

1723
06:32:50,060 --> 06:32:57,259
going to literally beat the ever-living fucking shit out of you without any remorse and it's it's

1724
06:32:57,259 --> 06:33:06,619
secure um this game can be that but it doesn't have to be and i know that there's bosses coming

1725
06:33:06,619 --> 06:33:12,220
up here in the next like six to ten hours in the game that people have said oh my god i wanted to

1726
06:33:12,220 --> 06:33:22,970
fucking uninstall the game right we'll see dark souls 2 is the most enjoyable but you get to decide

1727
06:33:22,970 --> 06:33:37,509
that depending on how you play these games secure is still more than 60 is it is it really still

1728
06:33:37,509 --> 06:33:45,939
full price i mean but my long-winded point with this was a lot of people were concerned when these

1729
06:33:45,939 --> 06:33:54,540
games started to become popular and i mean pre-patch for dan should should prove to you

1730
06:33:54,540 --> 06:33:59,990
that that kind of didn't matter and some of the bosses that are in the end of this game that

1731
06:33:59,990 --> 06:34:06,869
i've heard are un-fucking bearable so i still think it has the same charm i still think it

1732
06:34:06,869 --> 06:34:13,590
has the same uh pull i still think it's a very very difficult fun enjoyable interesting experience

1733
06:34:14,549 --> 06:34:26,119
need more balancing in the game i'm concerned about the spirit summons changing the balance for

1734
06:34:26,119 --> 06:34:37,220
non-users yeah but that is kind of hard mode isn't it if you don't use a summon and you're

1735
06:34:37,220 --> 06:34:43,060
you are the game is designed for you to be utilizing that stuff you can make this game

1736
06:34:43,060 --> 06:34:58,020
this game is hard or as easy as you want which is cool okay margit and um and godric back to back

1737
06:34:58,020 --> 06:35:01,540
after having no experience in the game and having not played a from software game in a while

1738
06:35:02,259 --> 06:35:09,369
what is that noise they were really really really hard for me they were very hard they

1739
06:35:09,369 --> 06:35:16,869
were very difficult um but i don't know from there there were summoning signs outside the

1740
06:35:16,869 --> 06:35:22,310
door in the other from software games as well you could summon a person to come help you

1741
06:35:22,310 --> 06:35:27,349
not just co-op like there would be a summoning sign and a lot of bosses in all the other from

1742
06:35:27,349 --> 06:35:38,549
software games so that's kind of the same thing isn't it margit is harder than 90 percent of the

1743
06:35:38,549 --> 06:35:44,860
bosses in this game i kind of think of who i besides radan which radan i thought was insane

1744
06:35:46,310 --> 06:35:56,840
godric was difficult but godric felt fair who hasn't felt i mean renala was all right once you

1745
06:35:56,840 --> 06:36:06,520
okay renala was bad until you figured out like kind of the gimmick behind it summons are way

1746
06:36:06,520 --> 06:36:12,900
tankier than some players ry card is pretty hard well we're about to find that out probably very

1747
06:36:12,900 --> 06:36:22,840
soon people will unironically say these things and still have stacked bugged buffs in the

1748
06:36:22,840 --> 06:36:28,900
fucking game and complain about bosses i mean there's a lot of crazy shit in it but that and

1749
06:36:28,900 --> 06:36:32,819
the point of all these games is they're unbelievably difficult until they're not

1750
06:36:33,939 --> 06:36:40,740
i was tearing my fucking hair out playing against margit and if you put me against margit right now

1751
06:36:40,740 --> 06:36:46,860
i would probably beat him in one or two tries like it's just it's just like i don't understand

1752
06:36:46,860 --> 06:36:51,580
what's happening i keep dying to this this is un-fucking-bearable this game sucks it's too hard

1753
06:36:52,299 --> 06:36:56,860
i would probably beat him first try maybe second try because i just know everything that he does

1754
06:36:57,819 --> 06:37:09,979
that's quite yeah that it's quite a comment your forehead looks sweaty it's because it is very

1755
06:37:10,700 --> 06:37:25,180
very much so wash your face it's it's because there's a piece of hair falling down it makes

1756
06:37:25,180 --> 06:37:50,060
me look like greasy there i fixed it but let me tell you i this game has so much content

1757
06:37:51,779 --> 06:38:04,180
that even okay what are you using as a weapon what even is this thing i get that this game has the

1758
06:38:04,180 --> 06:38:08,419
same amount of content i think is like all the dark souls games in the series have together

1759
06:38:08,419 --> 06:38:18,439
combined in all their dlc it's a little ridiculous all right these travel where does this go

1760
06:38:19,639 --> 06:38:26,330
what's your point my what do you mean what's my point you've i've been making it the whole time

1761
06:38:26,330 --> 06:38:32,139
game somebody said that they're they were they're afraid that this game is too easy or that with

1762
06:38:32,139 --> 06:38:38,299
the popularity comes a uh the game is going to be too easy and so from software is going to keep

1763
06:38:38,299 --> 06:38:43,020
making games and they're going to be simple and my point is that they've proven that that's not the

1764
06:38:43,020 --> 06:38:49,849
case 45 minute explanation it's a goddamn pod just title it podcast about from software okay

1765
06:38:50,810 --> 06:39:06,549
you have pointed ahead that last boss in securo though oh man that was the one of the most

1766
06:39:06,549 --> 06:39:13,319
unbearable experiences i think that took i took it took me like i think 50 to 60 attempts to beat

1767
06:39:13,319 --> 06:39:21,900
that guy and it was pain and suffering that was one of the hardest things i've ever had to do

1768
06:39:22,619 --> 06:39:38,790
he's easier than margit no no not a chance at help not in 100 million years you don't have to

1769
06:39:38,790 --> 06:39:51,830
parry every single move margit does to you you do with that other one all right there was a hold on

1770
06:39:51,830 --> 06:39:59,880
what is up here i had a lot of trouble with the ape yeah that was a that was bad too

1771
06:40:10,099 --> 06:40:17,290
oh what's that some of these bosses are harder than the last boss

1772
06:40:20,180 --> 06:40:37,340
imagine right i'm imagining that's probably the case what also do i think this game is nearly

1773
06:40:37,340 --> 06:40:42,090
as good as what everyone's saying no i think like dark souls 2 is probably better

1774
06:40:42,810 --> 06:40:51,220
dark souls one is probably better mario sunshine is probably better i think this probably sits at

1775
06:40:51,220 --> 06:41:07,189
like um i think the dark souls prepare to die edition on pc i think is a little bit more

1776
06:41:07,189 --> 06:41:28,860
polished than this game is all right i don't want to go that way yet no it's okay trying to take

1777
06:41:28,860 --> 06:41:44,380
my special baby bloodborne away from the number one spot it's gonna be really hard oh i fought

1778
06:41:44,380 --> 06:42:43,590
you on that bridge before i know what you do always the lock on i got it oh i still got it

1779
06:42:52,680 --> 06:44:46,659
oh panic stop panicking stop oh sorry shit what the fuck no i don't have any piano fuck damn it

1780
06:44:47,459 --> 06:45:00,380

1781
06:45:00,380 --> 06:45:14,020

1782
06:45:14,840 --> 06:45:31,590
fuck all right where where was that oh damn it i'm so mad oh i had it too oh i'm so frustrated

1783

1784

bonfire this one here right first try oh the church oh you know now you know what really

1787
06:46:31,880 --> 06:46:38,009
fucked it up it was me doing the weapon art without any mana i just that that was that was

1788
06:46:38,009 --> 06:46:42,169
the big mistake because if i had known that i didn't have any mana if i'd even looked

1789
06:46:42,729 --> 06:46:56,069
i wouldn't have done it and i wouldn't have gotten hit that like third time all right let's do it

1794
06:51:37,049 --> 06:51:43,319
bore unintended offspring it will never dry out remaining damp indefinitely that's kind of

1795
06:51:43,319 --> 06:52:06,250
disgusting okay just like your forehead shut up leave me alone that was the mcridler all right

1796
06:52:06,250 --> 06:52:15,340
what do we got for time uh all right it's getting late i think i'm gonna call it here about seven

1797
06:52:15,340 --> 06:52:35,159
hours oh i got this too where is it x and strength oh it's that thing okay this is a good time stop

1798
06:52:36,599 --> 06:52:49,500
so i am going to tentatively tell you and handle a full shift um i mean i my elden ring streams have

1799
06:52:49,500 --> 06:52:55,860
been like 10 hours nine to 12 some it's just i haven't been feeling that great so i kind of

1800
06:52:55,860 --> 06:52:59,619
don't want to push it more than like eight plus nine plus hours because i know i will

1801
06:53:00,580 --> 06:53:07,659
so i'm not gonna i've had stomach did you guys know colitis proctitis that shit it's back

1802
06:53:08,380 --> 06:53:12,779
it's flared up and i'm trying to take care of it i have medicine for it it usually takes like a

1803
06:53:12,779 --> 06:53:18,540
week or two sometimes to get rid of it uh to put it back into i guess you'd call it remission

1804
06:53:20,709 --> 06:53:28,580
uh let me i'm not let me clean some stuff up first uh let me see but let me let me see i don't

1805
06:53:29,540 --> 06:53:35,900
it's been pretty much tentative like if i can stream sitting here is really like not great i

1806
06:53:35,900 --> 06:53:44,020
really need to go do stuff with my body uh more than a few times so let me tentatively say

1807
06:53:44,659 --> 06:53:51,020
that the next stream will be on tuesday if i if i get up tomorrow and i'm fine i might just

1808
06:53:51,020 --> 06:54:00,200
stream tomorrow but let me tentatively just say tuesday um there's so much more left in the game

1809
06:54:00,200 --> 06:54:11,380
i can't wait so tuesday so 22nd if i'm filling up to it tomorrow then maybe but let's just say tuesday

1810
06:54:11,380 --> 06:54:19,560
same time around four yeah it's it's annoying but you know sometimes it has to be a thing that's

1811
06:54:19,560 --> 06:54:35,060
dealt with and it usually is dealt with very quickly let me level up first though all right

1812
06:54:35,060 --> 06:54:39,540
endurance is now at 20 that is exactly where i wanted it i don't need to do any more than that

1813
06:54:39,540 --> 06:54:53,500
that's perfect we still have a lot to do here and then there's even more to do here this is this

1814
06:54:53,500 --> 06:55:01,299
game's i just don't even know what to say is there more up here yeah have a great night thanks for

1815
06:55:01,540 --> 06:55:08,650
sticking around i don't these have been going late i know i start late and i go late so i apologize

1816
06:55:08,650 --> 06:55:13,860
if it's like three o'clock two o'clock in the morning for you right now uh but we will continue

1817
06:55:13,860 --> 06:55:18,819
we'll pick it up on tuesday right from here i'm assuming that i gotta go this way and maybe even

1818
06:55:18,819 --> 06:55:26,459
this way and then we're probably gonna get towards like the final finale of the game i would say

1819
06:55:27,180 --> 06:55:33,849
other two or three streams maybe total are you gonna do corn holio on tuesday well it depends

1820
06:55:33,849 --> 06:55:43,500
on if i die like 40 times in the same boss i'm gonna rest here call it there's still a ton more

1821
06:55:43,500 --> 06:55:51,459
left yeah there is there's a lot i'm really looking forward to it are gonna be like four

1822
06:55:51,459 --> 06:56:04,729
streams that's awesome that means i get to play more much love to you thanks for sticking around

1823
06:56:06,259 --> 06:56:15,450
keep an eye on the sus tuesday tentative tuesday the 22nd at four o'clock pacific more elden ring

1824
06:56:21,509 --> 06:56:26,709
we are going to be changing it up a little bit soon because uh ludwig and i are going to be doing

1825
06:56:27,270 --> 06:56:33,779
a stream together on the 29th that should be a fun time it's going to be kind of mayhem but

1826
06:56:33,779 --> 06:56:41,880
it'll be fun i'll probably break up elden ring again this week so if i stream elden ring on tuesday

1827
06:56:41,880 --> 06:56:49,000
then probably you know maybe on wednesday or thursday we'll do something else break it up

1828
06:56:49,000 --> 06:56:53,849
break it up a little bit go back to elden ring on the weekend and then the uh stream with me

1829
06:56:53,849 --> 06:57:10,939
and ludwig house flipper has new dlc well i mean that's i gotta play it right did you do a dos

1830
06:57:10,939 --> 06:57:19,029
night you know that actually is not a bad idea it sounds kind of fun we'll break it up because

1831
06:57:19,029 --> 06:57:23,220
i don't i don't want just every single stream to be elden ring because even for me i gotta break

1832
06:57:23,220 --> 06:57:45,860
it up too it's a no it's not till may oh okay avoid the adult dos games yeah it's been a week

1833
06:57:45,860 --> 06:57:51,590
since you put yeah but i mean the next i'm playing elden ring for at least another seven to eight

1834
06:57:51,590 --> 06:58:01,590
hours on tuesday so there'll be plenty more and i i have essentially committed to completing the

1835
06:58:01,590 --> 06:58:07,130
game on stream so i don't think that's going to be a scenario where that doesn't happen

1836
06:58:07,130 --> 06:58:23,830
eventually can we see auto next time yeah yeah i'll put auto on camera next time

1837
06:58:24,630 --> 06:58:33,799
the progress wise we kind of explored a lot i got through a little bit of the manner here

1838
06:58:34,520 --> 06:58:45,220
it's just so easy to sync just days into this game it's just ridiculous all progress

1839
06:58:45,220 --> 06:58:54,680
is good progress that's right yeah new map too i also want to go back out here i want to do the

1840
06:58:54,680 --> 06:59:02,139
assassination missions and i want to look around that the manner a little more i feel like i kind

1841
06:59:02,139 --> 06:59:16,009
of ran by it all right see you guys on tuesday keep an eye on sus make it to do list yeah i did that

1842
06:59:16,009 --> 06:59:23,830
a few streams ago and it was way way i was way more calculated i knew i knew the three or four

1843
06:59:23,830 --> 06:59:32,490
areas i was going to go on stream and i went there well i'll do that all right good night guys see

1844
06:59:32,490 --> 06:59:35,529
you tuesday take care yourselves bye
