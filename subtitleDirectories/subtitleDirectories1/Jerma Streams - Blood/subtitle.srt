1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:13,800
Uh, Glove Buddies lost that one. We're gonna do... It's so dark in here. Time for blood.

2
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:24,199
Change the title to Blood, with an exclamation point.

3
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:30,949
This, this game actually looks really cool. I think I'm gonna be really into this.

4
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:44,520
I think I very much would be into this game. Make sure that it's not too loud.

5
00:00:44,520 --> 00:01:20,599
Yeah, it's called Blood Fresh Supply. This is a boomer shooter?

6
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:23,799
Yeah, it actually is, but apparently it's really fucking good. I'm into it.

7
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:38,019
Blood, this is based. It's really hard. Okay, well, let's fucking go. You don't think I'm ready?

8
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,340
Gameplay setup. All right, full 3D aim. I think this is all fine. Auto crouch, auto aim.

9
00:01:47,459 --> 00:02:01,930
Put that on? Uh, what do I do? No dodge roll? Hey, I'm nine and saw you were playing Glover.

10
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:05,900
I don't think you're even allowed to be on Twitch, by the way. I'm just out of curiosity.

11
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:15,849
Okay, I think we're good. New game. The Way of All Flesh. These, okay, these are difficulties, right?

12
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:21,129
The Way of All Flesh. Even death may die. Farewell to arms. Dead reckoning. Post-mortem. So this is,

13
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:25,590
like, difficulty. I need to be in the middle. This is how they named shit back in, like,

14
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:33,000
boomer shooter days. All these are maps. Oh, episodes, okay. The Way of All Flesh.

15
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:40,680
Here, okay. Still kicking. Think on the inside. Lightly broiled. Well done. Extra crispy. Okay,

16
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:51,080
here we go. So let's do, uh, what should I do for these? I'm not doing extra crispy, no way.

17
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,419
I'm not doing still kicking and I'm not doing extra crispy. Gotta be somewhere in the middle.

18
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:05,580
I would get my burgers somewhere in here. Like, lightly broiled. Well, lightly broiled to well

19
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:45,750
done. I made my choice. Bugleberry. Was it Darth Vader? What?

20
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:36,759
Game's quiet. Okay, I have a pitchfork. Okay, I have no other weapons. All right, let's go.

21
00:04:36,759 --> 00:05:00,980
I have 82 fucking health already. What happened? Oh, this is one of those, this is one of those

22
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:22,139
insanely hard boomer shooters. I'm ready. Yo, I'm already fucking dead.

23
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:41,500
I'm already dead, guys. I'm already dead. What the fuck? Are you supposed to, uh, lightly broiled?

24
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:53,300
No way. We're going down a difficulty. This is too hard. No, no, no. I don't want to light this yet.

25
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:21,660
I have 18 health. Open for business. Jesus Christ. These sound effects are fucking crazy.

26
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:36,730
I can't, I'm, I'm not gonna be able to go in here. What the fuck? How am I supposed to do this?

27
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:47,779
Oh, you have a gun? No, I don't. It's too dark in here too. Hold on. I don't even have a gun.

28
00:06:48,579 --> 00:07:09,910
Dude, I don't, I don't have a gun. Why did I just go? I'm gray. Why am I so gray? What happened to

29
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:47,980
my camera? Okay, that's better. All right. So what the fuck? New game? All right. Turn 3D aim on.

30
00:07:47,980 --> 00:08:03,819
Pink on the inside. Try this one. There's a shotgun outside the cemetery. Really?

31
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:35,529
Okay. Those guys die in one hit now. Not like 10. This looks sick. I'm, I, I'm into this. Jesus.

32
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:44,740
This is still fucking hard. Oh, skull key. Glover difficulty. Where's the shotgun you guys talking

33
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:52,419
about? Where is it? I got the flare gun. Yeah. I only have like four shots in it though. Don't waste

34
00:08:52,419 --> 00:09:04,460
the flares. All right. It's in the, it's in the tomb. Oh shit. Okay. It's stuck. It's stuck.

35
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:46,330
Did I blow it up? You fucking lied. It's stuck. Open for business. You liars. What the fuck? How

36
00:09:46,330 --> 00:10:17,610
do I open it? Press and hold the mouse to throw TNT further. All right. Cool. All right. So where's,

37
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:24,250
how do I, can I actually get in there or are you guys lying? Is that a chipmunk?

38
00:10:25,210 --> 00:11:02,279
Why is there a chipmunk? Case of TNT. They can't get up here, right? What does that do? Oh,

39
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:13,210
shortcut. All right. What the fuck? What do I crouch? See a bunch of flares. Eight shots. All

40
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:29,799
right. F5 is saved. Oh my God. I'm sorry. I just like punched you. F5. Okay. Nice. What the fuck?

41
00:11:38,950 --> 00:12:01,419
What the fuck is happening? What's quick load? What's quick load? F6. F7. Please. I beg you.

42
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:22,120
3D aim. F0. Full 3D aim look. Okay. Input setup. All right. Configure findings. Use. Next weapon.

43
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:30,330
Weapon. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mines. Bombs. Jump boots. Diving suit. Beast vision. Med kit.

44
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:49,429
Maybe I have med kits. Chat. Chase cam. Okay. F3. Quick load is empty. What are you talking about?

45
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:57,580
I screenshot. God damn it. Are you kidding me? No, you're not, right? I didn't. I screenshot.

46
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:21,129
You piece of fucking shit. Let's go. I live again. Screenshot. All right. So it's F2.

47
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:50,740
You motherfucker. You're so ridiculous. That's so much damage. That's so damaged. That's so

48
00:13:50,740 --> 00:14:08,009
much damage. It's ridiculous how much damage that is. How are you? Open for business.

49
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:16,860
That's just Rorschach from The Weathermen. No, The Watchmen.

50
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:55,769
Fuck you. Nice. Okay. I got it. I'm getting it. Local temperature. 85 degrees.

51
00:14:58,059 --> 00:15:19,379
Chance of precipitation. 40%. Fuck. What the fuck? Oh my God. Fuck it. I don't even care. I didn't

52
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:55,500
kill everything. Get away from me. TNT. Got it. What the? Oh my fucking God. You spawn out of nowhere.

53
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:17,179
Reload. There's another motherfucker right here. What the fuck are you talking about?

54
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:50,419
What are you talking about? What are you talking about? Are they still alive? Can I pick this up?

55
00:16:50,419 --> 00:17:15,500
Whoa. What's in here? Got it. Okay. Fire. Can I pick this shit up? Employees must wash hands.

56
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:27,930
That like is inside of my head when he says things. Can I open any of this?

57
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:58,970
Doctor's bag. All right. Health is H, right? It's M. Okay. Is it a full heal? H is holster.

58
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:16,309
Why was he holster in this game? That makes no sense. Oh shit. How do I get that?

59
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:38,390
Hell, yeah. I got double flares. 77. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

60
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,910
Save it? What's going on? 76? . .

61
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:41,109
. .

62
00:18:41,109 --> 00:18:41,190
. . .

63
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:46,730
. . gate. . complement. What's happening? What's happening? What's going on? Why is this doing this?

64
00:18:46,730 --> 00:19:08,119
It's a power up? What am I supposed to use it with? Dude, I don't know.

65
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:30,390
Got it. Can I go down? Hit the switch to end the level.

66
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:36,339
We only need a lot more of these. We only need a lot more of these.

67
00:19:36,339 --> 00:20:30,019
Alright, turn the FOV up higher. What are we talking about? Yeah, that's not a thing.

68
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:39,819
Get the fuck out of here.

69
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:43,250
There we go, okay. So what's in here?

70
00:20:47,259 --> 00:20:51,329
Your tax dollars at work. Department of Transportation Track Replacement Program.

71
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,720
It's a DOS game remake?

72
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,720
Fresh victims for the ever-growing army of the undead.

73
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,819
Dead.

74
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:06,819
Oh, there's people in here.

75
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:10,730
Shotgun.

76
00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:14,029
I'm not using any weapons until I have to, right? There's probably bosses and shit.

77
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:34,380
I need health.

78
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,710
Quick save Andy, how would you play this game?

79
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:43,500
How would you play it?

80
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,500
Alternate fire, is it right click?

81
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,130
How much ammo do I have? Nine, that's it.

82
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:55,250
Quick save Andy.

83
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,230
Shotgun shells.

84
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:18,359
What happened? I turned?

85
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:33,779
Okay, I'm alright, I'm fine.

86
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:36,240
Quick save Andy.

87
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,099
I don't want to waste that, seriously.

88
00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:42,099
Die.

89
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,079
FOV is a display if you scroll down.

90
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:05,079
Is it actually?

91
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:10,559
Oh my goodness, you're actually not a liar.

92
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:13,630
Holy shit.

93
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:18,559
Wow.

94
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:38,910
Sounds like Adam Sandler.

95
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:57,779
What?

96
00:23:58,779 --> 00:24:02,190
Oh my god.

97
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,420
What? How did I miss everybody?

98
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,420
That doesn't make any sense.

99
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:15,329
What did that school announcement say?

100
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,329
Yeah, I have no idea, man.

101
00:24:20,869 --> 00:24:26,400
Wait, is this person bad?

102
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,410
No, okay.

103
00:24:49,269 --> 00:25:23,140
Let's go.

104
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,819
Alright, let me explore for a minute.

105
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:33,170
Aim for the head.

106
00:25:39,589 --> 00:25:40,589
That's the idea.

107
00:25:41,589 --> 00:25:45,839
I hate how loud that is.

108
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:48,140
Nothing else in here, right?

109
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,140
I don't like that.

110
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:59,740
That was close to the electrical thing.

111
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,900
I think we're good.

112
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,250
Did I get him?

113
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:50,779
Which phone is ringing?

114
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,130
Rare books and maps.

115
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:03,420
Did I open up all these?

116
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,720
And we're outside going here?

117
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:11,400
No, I didn't do this one.

118
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,400
No, okay, we're good.

119
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:30,359
I need to save ammo.

120
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,359
How much of these do I have?

121
00:27:51,329 --> 00:27:52,329
I have 12 of these.

122
00:27:53,329 --> 00:27:57,900
I can start using them.

123
00:28:00,029 --> 00:28:01,029
No, no, no, no, no, I refuse.

124
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:14,200
This is cheating.

125
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,200
This is not cheating.

126
00:28:21,789 --> 00:28:26,099
Come on.

127
00:28:27,099 --> 00:28:28,099
Eel with H?

128
00:28:29,099 --> 00:28:45,640
H is a holster, right?

129
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,170
Where?

130
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:05,140
Jesus.

131
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,410
Oh my God.

132
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:14,230
I want to reload.

133
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:23,829
You got the key, man?

134
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:55,819
Where's the key?

135
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:03,220
Alright, open that back up.

136
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:10,009
I can't open it again?

137
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:35,210
Why won't this open?

138
00:30:41,819 --> 00:30:42,819
What's going on?

139
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,240
How come I can't open it?

140
00:30:53,789 --> 00:30:57,210
I pressed the button.

141
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:04,119
Okay, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

142
00:31:14,769 --> 00:31:15,769
So I still need a key.

143
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:19,799
What if I get a key to go up here?

144
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:31,240
Press M?

145
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,019
Holy shit.

146
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:37,450
That was very weird.

147
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:39,750
Okay, so what?

148
00:31:46,819 --> 00:31:47,819
That one reloads so bad.

149
00:31:50,980 --> 00:32:04,500
You have no idea.

150
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,500
It was pretty interesting.

151
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,500
They just need farting and it'd be perfect.

152
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,500
Oh, I thought it was going to be a new melee weapon.

153
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,900
I like my hands, bloody.

154
00:32:24,339 --> 00:32:25,339
Leftovers.

155
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:29,690
Nothing in here?

156
00:32:32,769 --> 00:32:39,259
Whoa.

157
00:32:43,819 --> 00:32:44,819
What does that do?

158
00:32:52,339 --> 00:32:57,799
What's going on?

159
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,509
Wait, let me out of here.

160
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,660
What's up?

161
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:23,509
Is that opening a door?

162
00:33:24,509 --> 00:33:25,509
What's that doing?

163
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,750
Don't tell me to do that if it's not going to do anything.

164
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,039
Leftovers.

165
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,039
That's me saying that?

166
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,039
I have the same dialogue?

167
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:01,170
No, it burns, it burns.

168
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:08,030
Okay, I've got shotgun shells and more TNT.

169
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,030
I have fucking 21 of these.

170
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,030
So what is this doing?

171
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,269
I press this button and it...

172
00:34:15,269 --> 00:34:16,269
Ooh, what'd I get?

173
00:34:16,269 --> 00:34:19,300
What'd I get?

174
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,300
Limited invisibility.

175
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:23,739
Okay, what do I do?

176
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,679
What do I go with this?

177
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:37,099
I don't know what to do.

178
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:47,900
Oh my God, I did it.

179
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:54,920
I think that guy was hard.

180
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:05,019
Why is that on the screen?

181
00:35:16,429 --> 00:35:17,429
Okay, I got the key and now I can go back in that room.

182
00:35:18,429 --> 00:35:21,590
That just got intense.

183
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:29,460
That was fucking terrifying.

184
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,730
172 health, holy crap.

185
00:35:35,059 --> 00:35:36,059
Should I go down here?

186
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:41,750
No, this is just right outside.

187
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:43,750
This game still holds up?

188
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,630
I'm very much enjoying this.

189
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:49,579
It's quiet.

190
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:58,599
Where was the way to go to get out?

191
00:36:05,219 --> 00:36:06,219
Over here and then up this way, right?

192
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:14,539
The bookstore or something?

193
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:19,139
It was like up here.

194
00:36:20,769 --> 00:36:21,769
Where was it?

195
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,940
I don't remember where to go.

196
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:38,179
I think it's over here.

197
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:48,920
Yeah, it's right here.

198
00:36:55,219 --> 00:36:56,219
Oh!

199
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:05,079
Got it.

200
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,079
Unironically, I picked this up a few years back and it was super enjoyable.

201
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,079
Definitely more than a lot of the other classic ones.

202
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,449
Yeah, this is fun.

203
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:24,900
Is this Glover?

204
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:26,900
I mean, no.

205
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,329
Does it have to be?

206
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:35,599
Okay, it's nothing connected here.

207
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,320
Do you know why I like this?

208
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,320
Because it reminds me of Dusk.

209
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,500
We just played the other Dusk dev game and I'm playing Dusk again.

210
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,630
God, what a fucking fun game.

211
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,630
That game was so fucking good.

212
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,630
It's so good.

213
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,630
I just wish I could delete my memory and play it again.

214
00:38:02,059 --> 00:38:03,059
Oh my goodness.

215
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,380
I feel like I'm watching a stream with TTS on.

216
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:30,260
Okay, so I'm on the train.

217
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:42,760
I have so much ammo.

218
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,760
I need a key.

219
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,760
All right, I need a key.

220
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,969
So let's back here.

221
00:38:53,969 --> 00:38:54,969
Oh my God.

222
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:09,420
Who's laughing?

223
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,420
Get off my train.

224
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,420
That was Bart Simpson.

225
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,420
That was a Bart Simpson.

226
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:44,579
It was absolutely Bart Simpson.

227
00:39:45,579 --> 00:39:46,579
Is he dead?

228
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:50,039
So much TNT.

229
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:54,760
It's insane.

230
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,690
I need a key.

231
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:12,039
So many locked doors.

232
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,460
Oh fuck.

233
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:33,139
Oh fuck.

234
00:40:34,139 --> 00:40:49,960
Who turned the lights off?

235
00:40:54,019 --> 00:40:55,900
He's still alive.

236
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,710
Is that a chest?

237
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,460
Beast Vision?

238
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,460
What's that do?

239
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:06,539
Why are you good at this?

240
00:41:08,989 --> 00:41:16,440
I'm telling you right now.

241
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,960
You give me three buttons and I'll be proud.

242
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:22,710
That's all folks.

243
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:24,710
All right.

244
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:31,420
I'm just going to use the shotgun.

245
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,489
What is Beast Vision?

246
00:41:35,489 --> 00:41:37,880
Life Seed?

247
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:53,099
That doesn't count.

248
00:42:02,849 --> 00:42:03,849
What the fuck are you talking about?

249
00:42:04,849 --> 00:42:05,849
Do it again, do it again, do it again, do it again.

250
00:42:07,219 --> 00:42:44,809
I'm just going to go shoot.

251
00:42:45,809 --> 00:42:46,809
I don't know.

252
00:42:47,809 --> 00:42:58,650
I thought maybe there's like a ledge or something I could jump.

253
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:09,059
Why would this be here?

254
00:43:10,059 --> 00:43:11,059
What happened?

255
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:13,059
Something out there?

256
00:43:16,539 --> 00:43:17,539
Why would I be able to do this?

257
00:43:18,539 --> 00:43:23,820
Why can I open up all these?

258
00:43:26,019 --> 00:43:27,019
I don't get it.

259
00:43:29,019 --> 00:43:30,019
What's that for?

260
00:43:31,019 --> 00:43:32,840
Is there a double jump?

261
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,500
Secret windows?

262
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:42,250
Dude, I'm not even using it.

263
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,320
You're overthinking it?

264
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,320
Do a TNT jump.

265
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:53,340
Wait, no.

266
00:43:54,769 --> 00:44:02,980
I'm going the wrong way.

267
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:04,980
What's that?

268
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:07,860
Super armor.

269
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:09,860
Holy shit.

270
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,300
Okay, cool.

271
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,480
Fuck you.

272
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:22,409
This is the end of the train.

273
00:44:30,179 --> 00:44:31,179
Did I get a key?

274
00:44:32,179 --> 00:45:00,099
I don't think I got a key.

275
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:06,250
Oh, I did get a skull key.

276
00:45:10,179 --> 00:45:15,510
All right.

277
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:25,530
No.

278
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:46,570
What the fuck?

279
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:50,019
So much shotgun ammo.

280
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:57,239
Oh, it's a toilet.

281
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:00,570
Okay.

282
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:02,869
I've got a hundred ammo here.

283
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:14,309
Did I get them all?

284
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:24,550
Oh, this shit's locked.

285
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:34,409
Right, okay.

286
00:46:35,409 --> 00:46:46,059
These are all locked doors.

287
00:46:47,059 --> 00:46:52,710
How did I kill the one in the room?

288
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:54,710
What?

289
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:59,380
Right click on the zombies.

290
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:08,389
Auto aim might be on.

291
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:11,210
You're playing on easy?

292
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:18,340
Oh, look at how good I am at this game.

293
00:47:19,639 --> 00:47:20,639
It's shot quiet.

294
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:22,639
No, I ain't going to hear that.

295
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:26,670
I ain't going to hear that.

296
00:47:28,489 --> 00:47:32,030
All right.

297
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:38,989
Where was I going?

298
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:45,380
Okay, down.

299
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:49,650
And then I can go this way.

300
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:57,599
Blastovers.

301
00:48:02,869 --> 00:48:03,869
Am I doing anything in here?

302
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Cheater exposed.

303
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:19,039
I'm not cheating.

304
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:27,940
What?

305
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:34,300
You can play like this?

306
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:49,269
Oh, he's got auto aim on, doesn't he?

307
00:48:50,269 --> 00:48:51,269
He's got auto aim.

308
00:48:52,269 --> 00:48:53,269
That's why he's doing all this.

309
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:18,039
I keep trying to reload and I don't need to do that.

310
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:29,860
Did I do it?

311
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:32,420
Oh shit, I did it.

312
00:49:47,869 --> 00:49:48,869
Oh fuck.

313
00:49:49,869 --> 00:50:27,780
Oh my God, what's happening?

314
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:43,579
What?

315
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:45,579
Please use your med kits, press M.

316
00:50:46,579 --> 00:51:00,679
I got 113 health, I don't even use a med kit.

317
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:08,619
I must stop this train.

318
00:51:09,619 --> 00:51:14,630
Can I stop it?

319
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:17,190
Internal engine heat is critical.

320
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:21,800
I'm on the train.

321
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:25,190
Aren't I on the train?

322
00:51:30,659 --> 00:51:45,139
Oh, I did it, okay.

323
00:51:46,139 --> 00:51:47,639
What happened to Glover?

324
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:55,260
Well, the Glove buddies couldn't keep it afloat, unfortunately.

325
00:52:11,469 --> 00:52:13,860
What's over here?

326
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:15,860
Can I like power through this?

327
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:26,730
What is this?

328
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:39,619
That it?

329
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:43,849
That's scary, that sound.

330
00:52:44,849 --> 00:52:48,710
I think there's nothing else I can do here.

331
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:55,030
How do I get out of here?

332
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:58,099
That was a Glover reference.

333
00:53:01,579 --> 00:53:11,210
Step right up.

334
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,710
This promises to be fun.

335
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:23,420
Did I get it?

336
00:53:25,739 --> 00:53:33,449
Yep, okay.

337
00:53:37,179 --> 00:53:38,179
Get the fuck out of here.

338
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,500
Oh my God.

339
00:53:50,789 --> 00:53:51,789
That was way too much.

340
00:53:54,949 --> 00:54:08,800
Got it, okay.

341
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:13,019
I'm not going in there yet.

342
00:54:14,019 --> 00:54:19,280
There's a secret in the water.

343
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:35,539
What the fuck?

344
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:44,559
I'm drowning.

345
00:54:45,559 --> 00:54:46,559
What's even down here?

346
00:54:47,559 --> 00:54:51,679
Oh my goodness.

347
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:54,300
There's nobody for me to even shoot at.

348
00:54:54,300 --> 00:55:05,980
Let's go.

349
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:08,539
I hate mimes.

350
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:22,000
All right, there's games I can play.

351
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:32,300
Okay, how about this?

352
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:58,460
This is like a ball game?

353
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:28,800
Why is it shooting it out?

354
00:56:51,159 --> 00:56:52,159
Fuck you game.

355
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:57,980
There's another one, where is it?

356
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:10,190
What's this one?

357
00:57:13,099 --> 00:57:14,099
I want that.

358
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:25,340
How am I supposed to shoot with the shotgun?

359
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:30,719
What am I supposed to shoot them with?

360
00:57:32,329 --> 00:57:34,329
This is better than cruel aid.

361
00:57:35,329 --> 00:57:41,239
Does he talk?

362
00:57:49,969 --> 00:57:51,969
Jojo the idiot circus boy.

363
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:55,550
Jumping boots?

364
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:06,030
Can't go in there.

365
00:58:12,329 --> 00:58:16,059
And they had rat dogs.

366
00:58:18,969 --> 00:58:21,940
Who's shooting?

367
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:31,860
Can I eat these?

368
00:58:35,079 --> 00:58:36,079
I don't think so.

369
00:58:40,139 --> 00:58:47,840
Okay, so I have to shoot it with a shotgun?

370
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:55,260
I want it.

371
00:59:09,539 --> 00:59:10,539
No one wants to play with me.

372
00:59:11,539 --> 00:59:13,539
This microphone is fucking freaking me out.

373
00:59:16,059 --> 00:59:17,059
All right, so I did that.

374
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:25,179
What's this one?

375
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:52,300
Okay, throw a grenade.

376
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:02,380
I threw two grenades in here, dude.

377
01:00:04,199 --> 01:00:10,860
Did he already say eat my shorts?

378
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:18,219
Picked up a few bullets.

379
01:00:19,969 --> 01:00:28,630
All right, nice.

380
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:37,019
Old drum of bullets.

381
01:00:38,019 --> 01:00:42,519
All right, let's do Jojo the idiot circus boy.

382
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:56,920
Really?

383
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:06,500
This doesn't open from this side, okay.

384
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:15,260
Shit.

385
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:22,360
Keep out.

386
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:25,110
Reflective shots?

387
01:01:26,739 --> 01:01:30,409
Got it.

388
01:01:31,409 --> 01:01:33,099
Test your strength.

389
01:01:34,099 --> 01:01:35,099
Who is talking by the way?

390
01:01:50,670 --> 01:01:51,670
I guess I can go this way, right?

391
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:57,500
Is it going to kill me?

392
01:01:58,860 --> 01:01:59,860
Wait, what?

393
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:06,460
What am I seeing?

394
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:11,449
I need a key.

395
01:02:12,449 --> 01:02:13,690
Jumping boots?

396
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:23,349
Oh right, J for jumping boots?

397
01:02:25,739 --> 01:02:26,739
Okay, so hold on.

398
01:02:27,739 --> 01:02:38,840
Where is it going to get me to though?

399
01:02:43,539 --> 01:02:46,820
Did I turn them off?

400
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:52,500
Did they have like a, okay.

401
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:57,750
Now where do I go?

402
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,510
Where's the key?

403
01:03:05,059 --> 01:03:13,909
I missed an area?

404
01:03:14,909 --> 01:03:16,150
I turned it off, yeah.

405
01:03:17,579 --> 01:03:35,579
This is locked.

406
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:39,739
I could go up here.

407
01:03:40,739 --> 01:03:41,739
I don't have a key yet though.

408
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:46,340
I don't know where I'm supposed to go because I've been up there already.

409
01:03:48,289 --> 01:04:00,219
I need a key.

410
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:02,460
This is locked.

411
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:10,380
I don't know.

412
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:20,340
By the water, the ticket booth?

413
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:26,170
I missed an area?

414
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:29,750
Where?

415
01:04:39,179 --> 01:04:42,019
What are you talking about?

416
01:04:43,019 --> 01:04:44,019
That's the key?

417
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:46,840
Oh my goodness.

418
01:04:49,739 --> 01:04:50,739
Okay, but how do I get in here?

419
01:04:51,739 --> 01:04:53,750
Can I jump?

420
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:00,920
Underneath maybe?

421
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:11,530
Not underneath?

422
01:05:22,429 --> 01:05:27,059
What do I do?

423
01:05:28,059 --> 01:05:29,369
It looks like right there.

424
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:33,530
Should I try the jumping boots?

425
01:05:45,389 --> 01:05:50,340
TNT?

426
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:52,340
Oh fuck off.

427
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:55,159
I need a key.

428
01:06:01,199 --> 01:06:10,250
I can't get in here.

429
01:06:17,949 --> 01:06:18,949
The wall behind the mime.

430
01:06:19,949 --> 01:06:26,889
Behind the mime?

431
01:06:28,639 --> 01:06:31,159
That didn't work.

432
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:34,360
I don't know.

433
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:39,159
What about the freak area?

434
01:06:40,159 --> 01:06:41,590
Was there a freak area somewhere here?

435
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,280
I didn't even see this part.

436
01:06:45,280 --> 01:07:03,289
Oh my god, open the door!

437
01:07:04,289 --> 01:07:07,059
What the fuck was that?

438
01:07:08,059 --> 01:07:27,480
This is terrifying.

439
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:32,409
Fucking Glover.

440
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:11,409
That didn't get me anything though, did it?

441
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:15,820
Can I blow up one of these walls?

442
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:21,760
Oh my goodness, dude.

443
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:35,949
What?

444
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:41,390
I don't know what to do right now.

445
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:03,220
I want Jojo.

446
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:05,840
I want Jojo.

447
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:14,800
Where is it?

448
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:20,220
No!

449
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:21,220
Start with the flashing.

450
01:09:27,899 --> 01:09:32,600
What?

451
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:39,060
I got a key.

452
01:09:43,699 --> 01:09:44,699
Is it fall damage?

453
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:12,520
Jump and find out.

454
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:17,239
I got the key.

455
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:19,420
I can get out of here now.

456
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:24,409
I need a key.

457
01:10:25,409 --> 01:10:28,699
Locked.

458
01:10:29,869 --> 01:10:33,539
What are you talking about?

459
01:10:34,539 --> 01:10:45,300
I used the key?

460
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:47,300
You got the dagger key.

461
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:49,300
Sounds like Resident Evil.

462
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:06,500
I get it.

463
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,770
I have the eye.

464
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:56,060
Is it a new weapon?

465
01:11:57,060 --> 01:12:01,500
Yep.

466
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:03,500
Don't use this.

467
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:11,550
That doesn't work.

468
01:12:13,689 --> 01:12:14,930
Right click.

469
01:12:15,930 --> 01:12:18,899
I can do the double shot.

470
01:12:19,899 --> 01:12:20,899
Maybe I should make it harder.

471
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,500
I'm getting too strong.

472
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:47,170
Where do I go from here?

473
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:54,960
I think that's it.

474
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:59,630
Inside the train?

475
01:13:01,189 --> 01:13:02,189
There's a door in here.

476
01:13:08,039 --> 01:13:16,750
Where?

477
01:13:20,489 --> 01:13:21,489
I got pranked.

478
01:13:21,489 --> 01:13:32,970
Inside the train?

479
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:38,020
In here?

480
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:43,260
I think you guys are lying.

481
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:45,260
Eye door?

482
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:53,829
There's a window in the train.

483
01:14:00,260 --> 01:14:01,500
You guys are making stuff.

484
01:14:05,939 --> 01:14:06,939
You're making it up.

485
01:14:07,939 --> 01:14:09,939
Now we're going to go to the eye door.

486
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:14,789
Where was that door?

487
01:14:18,590 --> 01:14:19,590
I don't remember.

488
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:22,340
I think it was further out.

489
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:31,539
Like this way.

490
01:14:32,850 --> 01:14:36,260
That's the dagger.

491
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:46,619
Where was that?

492
01:14:50,289 --> 01:14:51,289
Down that hallway?

493
01:14:52,289 --> 01:14:59,100
Moon key?

494
01:15:03,789 --> 01:15:04,789
I'm not down in here.

495
01:15:06,609 --> 01:15:08,609
That 80's scary sound effect.

496
01:15:09,609 --> 01:15:10,609
It's so horrible.

497
01:15:11,850 --> 01:15:14,180
It's actually terrifying.

498
01:15:20,470 --> 01:15:21,470
Where is it?

499
01:15:39,930 --> 01:15:40,930
I'm going in the water I guess.

500
01:15:45,050 --> 01:15:46,050
Oh shit.

501
01:15:47,050 --> 01:15:48,050
Oh my.

502
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:50,050
Really?

503
01:15:52,569 --> 01:15:53,569
I don't even need to kill this thing.

504
01:15:56,149 --> 01:16:05,500
Just go.

505
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:07,500
I'm going to drown down here if I don't hurry up and get out of here.

506
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:23,939
My nose is so itchy.

507
01:16:23,939 --> 01:16:28,819
I got it.

508
01:16:29,819 --> 01:16:30,819
60 out of 73.

509
01:16:49,979 --> 01:17:24,890
6 out of 12.

510
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:32,380
Key.

511
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:34,380
I can go lower.

512
01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:49,220
This dude is literally evil.

513
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:13,079
I'm going to get up.

514
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:21,100
I need a key.

515
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:23,100
I need a key.

516
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:25,100
I need a key.

517
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:31,180
I can't open that?

518
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:37,899
Oh my god.

519
01:18:38,899 --> 01:18:39,899
Open?

520
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:03,630
How do I get up there?

521
01:19:09,770 --> 01:19:10,770
Alright skull key.

522
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:16,720
Oh my god.

523
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:47,229
Alright.

524
01:19:48,229 --> 01:20:05,409
I need a key.

525
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:09,760
It's here in my mouth.

526
01:20:15,989 --> 01:20:32,529
We're good.

527
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:44,300
Moon key.

528
01:20:54,119 --> 01:20:55,119
Where is that moon door?

529
01:20:55,119 --> 01:20:57,640
Ah.

530
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:28,420
Moon key.

531
01:21:31,329 --> 01:21:39,479
You idiot.

532
01:21:46,289 --> 01:21:47,289
Why is the music off?

533
01:21:52,939 --> 01:21:58,090
It's not off.

534
01:22:21,859 --> 01:22:23,100
CD music.

535
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:28,220
I don't have CD music.

536
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:31,800
Don't use CD music.

537
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:33,800
What are you talking about?

538
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,939
I'm trying to get it to work.

539
01:22:37,939 --> 01:22:38,939
Is this supposed to be like a...

540
01:22:39,939 --> 01:22:40,939
Am I missing like the...

541
01:22:41,939 --> 01:22:42,939
Am I missing that?

542
01:22:43,939 --> 01:22:57,850
Alright don't go anywhere yet.

543
01:23:09,069 --> 01:23:16,649
Hold on.

544
01:23:17,649 --> 01:23:18,649
Die.

545
01:23:26,479 --> 01:23:27,479
This level doesn't play any music.

546
01:23:36,779 --> 01:23:37,779
Oh what the fuck dude?

547
01:23:39,729 --> 01:23:45,260
Okay I'm good.

548
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:46,260
Oh my goodness.

549
01:23:46,260 --> 01:24:10,649
Ow.

550
01:24:10,649 --> 01:24:11,649
Alright I'm looking for a door right?

551
01:24:12,649 --> 01:24:16,189
What am I looking for?

552
01:24:16,189 --> 01:24:17,189
I'm looking for like the moon door or something.

553
01:24:19,390 --> 01:24:20,390
What door am I looking for?

554
01:24:20,390 --> 01:24:23,039
I don't know where that guy came from.

555
01:24:28,699 --> 01:24:29,699
No I already got this one.

556
01:24:29,699 --> 01:24:30,699
It's something else.

557
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:37,979
Spider door?

558
01:24:43,569 --> 01:24:44,569
I want to go through here.

559
01:24:44,569 --> 01:24:47,449
Oh I got to activate that thing don't I?

560
01:24:48,449 --> 01:24:53,340
Hold on.

561
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:54,340
This?

562
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:55,510
No.

563
01:24:55,510 --> 01:24:59,310
Spider door?

564
01:25:02,979 --> 01:25:03,979
I don't remember where the spider door is.

565
01:25:05,859 --> 01:25:06,859
Does it show up on the map?

566
01:25:06,859 --> 01:25:16,739
That's awful.

567
01:25:18,050 --> 01:25:19,050
I just say that like...

568
01:25:20,050 --> 01:25:21,050
Oh my god.

569
01:25:21,050 --> 01:25:22,050
I fucking god damn it.

570
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:23,050
How far back was I?

571
01:25:24,670 --> 01:25:25,670
I don't remember where this is.

572
01:25:25,670 --> 01:25:28,189
It's right here.

573
01:25:28,189 --> 01:25:33,460
I'm fine.

574
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:34,460
I forget where I just was.

575
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:39,420
Shit.

576
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:40,420
I don't...

577
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:45,500
I forget where that is.

578
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:46,500
I fucking freaked out too.

579
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:51,550
I don't remember where that is.

580
01:25:51,550 --> 01:25:52,550
This way...

581
01:25:52,550 --> 01:25:57,060
I don't remember.

582
01:25:58,060 --> 01:26:15,619
Okay.

583
01:26:15,619 --> 01:26:16,619
I think it's...

584
01:26:16,619 --> 01:26:17,619
Yep.

585
01:26:17,619 --> 01:26:25,899
TF2 sound effects?

586
01:26:26,899 --> 01:26:35,539
New gun.

587
01:26:36,539 --> 01:26:37,779
Ooh napalm.

588
01:26:37,779 --> 01:26:38,779
That was loud.

589
01:26:41,369 --> 01:26:42,369
I just spit all over my mouth.

590
01:26:43,609 --> 01:26:44,609
Go to the spider door?

591
01:26:44,609 --> 01:26:47,449
Hold on.

592
01:26:47,449 --> 01:26:48,449
I got some shit going on here.

593
01:26:48,449 --> 01:26:50,010
Hold on.

594
01:26:51,250 --> 01:26:58,739
What did that do?

595
01:26:58,739 --> 01:26:59,739
Oh my goodness.

596
01:26:59,739 --> 01:27:05,079
What did that do?

597
01:27:06,079 --> 01:27:10,899
Gas can?

598
01:27:11,899 --> 01:27:17,640
You'll know what to do when the time comes.

599
01:27:19,329 --> 01:27:20,329
Whoa!

600
01:27:20,329 --> 01:27:21,329
Okay.

601
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:24,460
Waste of fucking...

602
01:27:24,460 --> 01:27:46,060
Where do I go?

603
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:51,140
Use the spider door?

604
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:53,140
I don't remember where the spider door is guys.

605
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:59,239
Is the spider door on the map?

606
01:27:59,239 --> 01:28:02,300
Where's the spider door?

607
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:03,300
Use beast vision?

608
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:11,409
Use the spider door on the map.

609
01:28:11,409 --> 01:28:12,409
Moon door again?

610
01:28:12,409 --> 01:28:14,409
Gotta go through the CD door.

611
01:28:14,409 --> 01:28:16,409
Spider door is in the spider room.

612
01:28:16,409 --> 01:28:20,949
As I was saying, go to the moon door.

613
01:28:20,949 --> 01:28:23,920
Okay.

614
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:25,609
And then...

615
01:28:25,609 --> 01:28:27,609
Use the among us vision?

616
01:28:27,609 --> 01:28:34,689
Two portals lead to certain death.

617
01:28:34,689 --> 01:28:37,119
Choose wisely.

618
01:28:37,119 --> 01:28:43,250
Oh fog.

619
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:44,250
Okay.

620
01:28:44,250 --> 01:28:46,060
Teeth door?

621
01:28:46,060 --> 01:28:48,060
Regular door or like mud door.

622
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:52,380
Teeth door.

623
01:28:52,380 --> 01:29:16,399
Did I get it?

624
01:29:16,399 --> 01:29:21,670
I did it.

625
01:29:21,670 --> 01:29:26,020
This is a secret if you drop down.

626
01:29:26,020 --> 01:29:30,909
Okay.

627
01:29:30,909 --> 01:29:31,909
Ban that guy for 10 minutes.

628
01:29:31,909 --> 01:29:36,539
What's in the other doors?

629
01:29:36,539 --> 01:29:37,539
I'm curious.

630
01:29:37,539 --> 01:29:38,779
Whoa!

631
01:29:38,779 --> 01:29:43,739
Wrong door.

632
01:29:43,739 --> 01:30:10,770
What about this one?

633
01:30:10,770 --> 01:30:11,770
Only one secret?

634
01:30:11,770 --> 01:30:24,140
That's it?

635
01:30:24,140 --> 01:30:25,140
I'm almost out of ammo.

636
01:30:25,140 --> 01:30:26,579
This is bad.

637
01:30:26,579 --> 01:30:27,579
I gotta start using the flares.

638
01:30:27,579 --> 01:30:29,579
I have 75 fucking flares.

639
01:30:29,579 --> 01:30:38,239
I could probably jump that.

640
01:30:38,239 --> 01:30:39,239
Let's see what's down here.

641
01:30:40,239 --> 01:30:42,310
Let me try.

642
01:30:42,310 --> 01:30:43,310
Let me jump that.

643
01:30:43,310 --> 01:30:45,319
Oh fuck.

644
01:30:45,319 --> 01:30:47,970
Whatever.

645
01:30:47,970 --> 01:31:02,840
I can jump this.

646
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:10,199
Oh my god!

647
01:31:44,289 --> 01:31:45,289
Dude!

648
01:31:51,460 --> 01:31:56,340
Thank you.

649
01:31:56,340 --> 01:32:00,340
Don't kill me here.

650
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:14,890
Oh you motherfucker.

651
01:32:14,890 --> 01:32:15,890
I swear to god.

652
01:32:15,890 --> 01:32:18,579
Isn't there full nudity in this game?

653
01:32:18,579 --> 01:32:19,579
Is there?

654
01:32:19,579 --> 01:32:20,939
I don't think...

655
01:32:20,939 --> 01:32:21,939
I don't know.

656
01:32:21,939 --> 01:32:38,199
A secret is revealed, huh?

657
01:32:38,199 --> 01:32:40,439
Already got it, didn't I?

658
01:32:40,439 --> 01:32:57,359
None of these blow up.

659
01:32:57,359 --> 01:33:01,500
You lost 4k viewers because you stopped playing Glover.

660
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:05,100
Oh well.

661
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:06,100
Oh!

662
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:10,689
And where the fuck did they come from?

663
01:33:18,579 --> 01:33:19,579
Glover.

664
01:33:19,579 --> 01:33:22,140
I miss Glover.

665
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:25,920
I'm not getting hit by that.

666
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:34,260
Ground, please.

667
01:33:38,619 --> 01:33:45,100
I only have two bullets left.

668
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:47,369
Whatever.

669
01:33:47,369 --> 01:33:48,369
Can we go back to Glover?

670
01:33:48,369 --> 01:33:50,310
No.

671
01:33:50,310 --> 01:33:51,310
Let me finish this.

672
01:33:54,189 --> 01:33:56,579
Let me finish this.

673
01:33:56,579 --> 01:34:08,960
Where do I go?

674
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:14,039
Where do I go?

675
01:34:14,039 --> 01:34:16,939
Blood is better?

676
01:34:16,939 --> 01:34:19,119
I'm just playing a game, man.

677
01:34:19,119 --> 01:34:22,340
How do I get out of here?

678
01:34:22,340 --> 01:34:30,470
Little old fashioned Glover pull?

679
01:34:30,470 --> 01:34:31,470
No.

680
01:34:31,470 --> 01:34:33,470
I'm not doing a Glover pull.

681
01:34:34,470 --> 01:34:39,039
Do you have your chance?

682
01:34:39,039 --> 01:34:44,500
Backwards here?

683
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:51,029
I don't know where to go.

684
01:34:51,029 --> 01:34:53,300
It's on the other side.

685
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:54,300
Oh shit.

686
01:34:54,300 --> 01:35:05,140
Hold on.

687
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:08,779
Fuck you.

688
01:35:08,779 --> 01:35:09,779
Come on.

689
01:35:09,779 --> 01:35:12,180
Really?

690
01:35:12,180 --> 01:35:28,390
I'm out of juice.

691
01:35:28,390 --> 01:35:30,020
I'm out of juice.

692
01:35:30,020 --> 01:35:34,779
I'm out of juice.

693
01:35:34,779 --> 01:35:43,630
Where do I go?

694
01:35:43,630 --> 01:35:52,460
Glover across the bridge?

695
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:53,460
Oh my goodness.

696
01:35:54,460 --> 01:36:09,210
Ooh.

697
01:36:09,210 --> 01:36:18,260
Go back to Glover?

698
01:36:18,260 --> 01:36:20,199
No.

699
01:36:20,199 --> 01:36:21,199
You guys had a chance.

700
01:36:21,199 --> 01:36:23,199
You guys had your chance.

701
01:36:23,199 --> 01:36:27,949
You threw Glover away because you didn't want to see...

702
01:36:27,949 --> 01:36:37,510
Not you guys.

703
01:36:37,510 --> 01:36:46,689
Not you guys.

704
01:36:46,689 --> 01:36:53,050
Oh gracious.

705
01:36:53,050 --> 01:36:54,050
Who voted for blood?

706
01:36:54,050 --> 01:36:55,220
I did.

707
01:36:55,220 --> 01:36:56,220
I voted for it.

708
01:36:56,220 --> 01:37:16,229
Oh, dad's playing his boomer shooters.

709
01:37:16,229 --> 01:37:21,010
Glover, boomer, blood, boomer.

710
01:37:21,010 --> 01:37:29,390
Is that Dr. Andy?

711
01:37:29,390 --> 01:37:33,359
How am I a doctor?

712
01:37:33,359 --> 01:37:48,020
Oh, there he is.

713
01:37:48,020 --> 01:37:49,020
Dr. Andy.

714
01:37:49,020 --> 01:37:52,020
I need a key.

715
01:37:52,020 --> 01:37:53,020
Shit.

716
01:37:53,020 --> 01:37:55,029
Come on.

717
01:37:55,029 --> 01:37:58,829
I'm out of ammo.

718
01:37:58,829 --> 01:38:01,840
I've been streaming for four hours.

719
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:02,840
Holy shit.

720
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:04,079
Oops.

721
01:38:04,079 --> 01:38:05,079
Why is that an oops?

722
01:38:05,079 --> 01:38:06,079
Oh my God.

723
01:38:06,079 --> 01:38:07,079
Four hours.

724
01:38:07,079 --> 01:38:14,529
Oops.

725
01:38:14,529 --> 01:38:20,100
Paging Dr. Andy.

726
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:21,100
Paging Dr. Andy.

727
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:23,100
Is Dr. Andy in the building, please?

728
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:27,090
Paging Dr. Andy.

729
01:38:27,090 --> 01:38:33,800
We've got a handful of zoomers that don't want to see this old shit.

730
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:38,000
And by handful, I mean like 15,000.

731
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:44,779
Oh, don't.

732
01:38:44,779 --> 01:38:50,100
I'm so fucking far away.

733
01:38:50,100 --> 01:39:03,600
I'm about to delete it.

734
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:15,119
Blow up already.

735
01:39:15,119 --> 01:39:23,529
Blood rocks?

736
01:39:23,529 --> 01:39:24,529
No, I'm having fun.

737
01:39:24,529 --> 01:39:25,529
This game is good.

738
01:39:25,529 --> 01:39:27,960
It's fun just to shoot stuff.

739
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:29,260
With my mouth open.

740
01:39:29,260 --> 01:39:35,060
These same fucking people behind me.

741
01:39:35,060 --> 01:39:41,550
Fuck.

742
01:39:41,550 --> 01:39:51,939
Blood buddies?

743
01:39:51,939 --> 01:39:53,939
No, don't even start this shit.

744
01:39:53,939 --> 01:40:05,939
Who are the blood buddies?

745
01:40:05,939 --> 01:40:17,050
Get the fuck.

746
01:40:17,050 --> 01:40:39,750
Boring buddies?

747
01:40:39,750 --> 01:40:47,050
The boring buddies.

748
01:40:47,050 --> 01:40:49,050
I knew you were right there too, you piece of shit.

749
01:40:49,050 --> 01:40:51,050
This room sucks.

750
01:40:51,050 --> 01:41:12,130
Should I go in there?

751
01:41:12,130 --> 01:41:18,739
Oh, that's nothing.

752
01:41:18,739 --> 01:41:20,939
What did I get?

753
01:41:20,939 --> 01:41:22,949
I can't go in there.

754
01:41:22,949 --> 01:41:27,989
Looks like I can go in there, but I can't.

755
01:41:27,989 --> 01:41:28,989
Play strawberry magic?

756
01:41:28,989 --> 01:41:41,699
Alright, blood buddies, strawberry buds, TF2, titanium, IQ, brain, friends.

757
01:41:41,699 --> 01:41:42,699
Whatever you want to call it.

758
01:41:42,699 --> 01:41:43,699
Whatever.

759
01:41:43,699 --> 01:41:53,069
I don't know.

760
01:41:53,069 --> 01:41:54,069
Did I get a key?

761
01:41:54,069 --> 01:42:04,399
I don't even remember.

762
01:42:04,399 --> 01:42:06,399
Drew, crew, banana bros.

763
01:42:06,399 --> 01:42:09,279
I need a key.

764
01:42:09,279 --> 01:42:21,420
How many factions do we have here?

765
01:42:21,420 --> 01:42:24,420
How come Glover doesn't need keys, you know?

766
01:42:24,420 --> 01:42:31,060
What do you want to do after this?

767
01:42:31,060 --> 01:42:32,060
I'm open to suggestions.

768
01:42:32,060 --> 01:42:33,939
Not Glover.

769
01:42:33,939 --> 01:42:34,939
We're not going back to that.

770
01:42:34,939 --> 01:42:35,939
Everyone will leave.

771
01:42:35,939 --> 01:42:42,430
I'm not playing Among Us.

772
01:42:42,430 --> 01:42:43,430
Thriving?

773
01:42:43,430 --> 01:42:47,359
Whoa.

774
01:42:47,359 --> 01:42:58,949
Theme, NG, drive?

775
01:42:58,949 --> 01:42:59,949
Go back to Wobble Dogs?

776
01:42:59,949 --> 01:43:02,729
We'll see.

777
01:43:02,729 --> 01:43:16,800
I need some blood buddies to tell me where to go here, because I'm kind of lost.

778
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:21,560
I need a key.

779
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:22,560
I don't know.

780
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:30,710
Am I left?

781
01:43:30,710 --> 01:43:33,170
Finish Thrillville.

782
01:43:33,170 --> 01:43:36,899
No.

783
01:43:36,899 --> 01:43:42,699
You should go to the shut the fuck up room.

784
01:43:42,699 --> 01:43:49,380
Go into the fire.

785
01:43:49,380 --> 01:43:50,380
I can't walk in.

786
01:43:50,380 --> 01:43:51,380
I can't.

787
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:52,380
Unless there's something I'm doing wrong.

788
01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:53,380
Anybody know what to do?

789
01:43:53,380 --> 01:44:00,189
Go up the stairs.

790
01:44:00,189 --> 01:44:03,479
There's a new open passage away.

791
01:44:03,479 --> 01:44:04,479
One of these?

792
01:44:04,479 --> 01:44:05,479
Oh, dude, you were right.

793
01:44:05,479 --> 01:44:06,850
You got it.

794
01:44:06,850 --> 01:44:08,539
Fucking open.

795
01:44:08,539 --> 01:44:09,539
Nice.

796
01:44:09,539 --> 01:44:22,810
Oh.

797
01:44:22,810 --> 01:44:23,810
Oh.

798
01:44:23,810 --> 01:44:29,340
Stop throwing it so far.

799
01:44:29,340 --> 01:44:35,500
Got it.

800
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:36,500
Shit.

801
01:44:36,500 --> 01:44:37,500
No, don't die, please.

802
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:46,869
All right.

803
01:44:46,869 --> 01:44:47,869
Go back up that way.

804
01:44:47,869 --> 01:44:48,869
You're getting drop-shooted.

805
01:44:48,869 --> 01:44:54,529
How do I get up there without the jump?

806
01:44:54,529 --> 01:44:58,140
I wasted all my jump fluid.

807
01:44:58,140 --> 01:45:03,920
I got to go back to the door.

808
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:11,689
How many more levels do I have of this campaign?

809
01:45:16,699 --> 01:45:17,699
Save the game.

810
01:45:17,699 --> 01:45:21,310
I did.

811
01:45:21,310 --> 01:45:22,310
I'm almost at the end.

812
01:45:22,310 --> 01:45:23,310
Yeah.

813
01:45:23,310 --> 01:45:24,310
Let me complete this.

814
01:45:24,310 --> 01:45:26,770
Right?

815
01:45:26,770 --> 01:45:29,350
I just want to be at one level in blood.

816
01:45:29,350 --> 01:45:30,350
Come on.

817
01:45:30,350 --> 01:45:31,350
I need to be at one level in blood.

818
01:45:31,350 --> 01:45:34,640
Oh, fuck.

819
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:35,640
Mom.

820
01:45:35,640 --> 01:45:36,640
Just one more level.

821
01:45:36,640 --> 01:45:42,739
I mean, if I'm almost done.

822
01:45:42,739 --> 01:45:44,239
Come on.

823
01:45:44,239 --> 01:45:45,239
Come on.

824
01:45:45,239 --> 01:45:46,239
Come on.

825
01:45:46,239 --> 01:45:47,239
Come on.

826
01:45:47,239 --> 01:45:48,239
Come on.

827
01:45:48,239 --> 01:45:49,239
Come on.

828
01:45:49,239 --> 01:45:50,239
Come on.

829
01:45:50,239 --> 01:45:52,699
Come on.

830
01:45:52,699 --> 01:46:09,100
Come on.

831
01:46:09,100 --> 01:46:10,100
Come on.

832
01:46:10,100 --> 01:46:18,899
Come on.

833
01:46:18,899 --> 01:46:19,899
Come on.

834
01:46:19,899 --> 01:46:27,090
Come on.

835
01:46:27,090 --> 01:46:28,090
Come on.

836
01:46:28,090 --> 01:46:29,579
Come on.

837
01:46:29,579 --> 01:46:30,579
I mean, if I'm almost done.

838
01:46:30,579 --> 01:46:31,579
Right?

839
01:46:31,579 --> 01:46:37,100
I can't just give up and just leave before completing one campaign.

840
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:41,260
I need a key.

841
01:46:41,260 --> 01:46:42,260
Just one level.

842
01:46:42,260 --> 01:46:43,260
Yeah.

843
01:46:43,260 --> 01:46:44,260
Just one more.

844
01:46:44,260 --> 01:46:45,260
I just want to play one level.

845
01:46:45,260 --> 01:46:56,489
Ooh.

846
01:46:56,489 --> 01:46:57,489
I got the fire key.

847
01:46:57,489 --> 01:47:08,539
You're on five out of seven, and seven is really short.

848
01:47:08,539 --> 01:47:09,539
Yeah.

849
01:47:09,539 --> 01:47:10,539
Let me down.

850
01:47:10,539 --> 01:47:20,800
I'm just...

851
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:21,800
What's going on here?

852
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:33,329
Oh, my God.

853
01:47:33,329 --> 01:47:42,760
Lord.

854
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:43,760
Seven is really short.

855
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:44,760
Yeah.

856
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:54,899
Let's go.

857
01:47:54,899 --> 01:47:55,899
Son of a bitch wants pain.

858
01:47:55,899 --> 01:48:05,460
Get in.

859
01:48:05,460 --> 01:48:06,460
Get in.

860
01:48:06,460 --> 01:48:07,460
What's happening here?

861
01:48:07,460 --> 01:48:08,460
JermaWalk, WobbleDogs, JermaWalk.

862
01:48:08,460 --> 01:48:10,979
Hold on.

863
01:48:10,979 --> 01:48:11,979
I'm playing this.

864
01:48:11,979 --> 01:48:13,279
I don't even know what the fuck just happened.

865
01:48:13,279 --> 01:48:21,560
Oh, my God.

866
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:22,560
Everybody quiet.

867
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:23,560
You can't even be fucking si...

868
01:48:23,560 --> 01:48:24,560
Oh.

869
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:25,560
I missed so many of those.

870
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:28,659
That was so bad.

871
01:48:28,659 --> 01:48:29,659
I didn't even run out of bullets.

872
01:48:29,659 --> 01:48:30,659
Auto-aim.

873
01:48:30,659 --> 01:48:31,659
No, it's not.

874
01:48:31,659 --> 01:48:35,899
I'm fine.

875
01:48:36,060 --> 01:48:37,060
Spider key.

876
01:48:37,060 --> 01:48:48,479
Let's go.

877
01:48:48,479 --> 01:48:49,560
What the fuck is happening?

878
01:48:49,560 --> 01:49:33,890
I don't care about that.

879
01:49:33,890 --> 01:49:41,489
I just want to get out.

880
01:49:41,489 --> 01:49:51,180
Let's go.

881
01:49:51,180 --> 01:49:58,949
You have a doctor bag?

882
01:49:58,949 --> 01:49:59,949
Moon key.

883
01:49:59,949 --> 01:50:00,949
I am tearing it up right now.

884
01:50:00,949 --> 01:50:04,939
I'm being honest with you.

885
01:50:04,939 --> 01:50:20,840
Is this preparing me for something?

886
01:50:20,840 --> 01:50:21,840
Let's go.

887
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:44,960
I have the...

888
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:45,960
I'm not ready.

889
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:46,960
I'm ready.

890
01:50:46,960 --> 01:51:00,359
I'm ready.

891
01:51:00,359 --> 01:51:08,449
I'm ready.

892
01:51:08,449 --> 01:51:09,449
I'm ready.

893
01:51:09,449 --> 01:51:10,449
I'm ready.

894
01:51:10,449 --> 01:51:11,449
I'm ready.

895
01:51:11,449 --> 01:51:18,960
I'm ready.

896
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:23,340
I'm ready.

897
01:51:23,340 --> 01:51:24,340
I'm ready.

898
01:51:24,340 --> 01:51:25,340
I'm ready.

899
01:51:25,340 --> 01:51:33,300
I'm ready.

900
01:51:33,300 --> 01:51:44,010
I'm ready.

901
01:51:44,010 --> 01:52:04,279
I have a maximum amount, can I do double handed?

902
01:52:04,279 --> 01:52:05,119
Oops.

903
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:08,560
What does that do?

904
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:09,939
Where am I?

905
01:52:09,939 --> 01:52:10,779
No, get out of here.

906
01:52:14,930 --> 01:52:20,210
Shit!

907
01:52:20,210 --> 01:52:22,170
Dude, you kicking butt right now, dude.

908
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:25,600
I can't even.

909
01:53:29,829 --> 01:53:33,079
Wobble Warriors!

910
01:53:33,079 --> 01:53:37,079
Oh, Wobble Warriors!

911
01:53:37,079 --> 01:53:39,329
All right, this is it, guys, we're ready to go.

912
01:53:39,329 --> 01:53:53,039
Check this out, we're at the fucking final level.

913
01:53:53,039 --> 01:53:54,039
Six out of seven.

914
01:53:54,039 --> 01:53:55,720
All right, well, whatever, it's probably not that long.

915
01:53:55,720 --> 01:54:00,890
I'm fine.

916
01:54:00,890 --> 01:54:02,760
Hell yeah, look at this.

917
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:04,880
Wobble Warriors.

918
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:08,789
Wobble Warriors, you're gonna have to wait

919
01:54:08,789 --> 01:54:10,350
until next weekend.

920
01:54:10,350 --> 01:54:16,869
No.

921
01:54:16,869 --> 01:54:27,310
Let me beat this first thing.

922
01:54:27,310 --> 01:54:28,149
Ophelia.

923
01:54:28,149 --> 01:54:32,300
No!

924
01:54:32,300 --> 01:54:34,319
Show yourself.

925
01:54:34,319 --> 01:54:37,199
Show yourself!

926
01:54:37,199 --> 01:54:51,779
Oh no, it's Satan!

927
01:54:51,779 --> 01:55:12,970
God damn it.

928
01:55:12,970 --> 01:55:14,369
Goodbye.

929
01:55:14,369 --> 01:55:18,050
Sleep, Ophelia.

930
01:55:18,050 --> 01:55:20,850
I'm so getting it off me.

931
01:55:20,850 --> 01:55:36,060
Oh no!

932
01:55:36,060 --> 01:55:47,550
I thought, he said there was another one.

933
01:55:47,550 --> 01:56:04,640
Why am I burning this lady?

934
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:19,569
He's shooting, he's shooting in the head?

935
01:56:26,619 --> 01:56:31,649
I feel like that was kind of like made as like a machinima.

936
01:56:31,649 --> 01:56:35,039
I got it.

937
01:56:35,039 --> 01:56:36,949
I beat it.

938
01:56:36,949 --> 01:56:40,840
All right, that was fun.

939
01:56:40,840 --> 01:56:42,239
So what are we gonna do next?

940
01:56:42,239 --> 01:56:46,350
This is just like, we're just doing whatever.

941
01:56:46,350 --> 01:56:47,430
I can't believe you made me watch this.

942
01:56:47,430 --> 01:56:48,470
That was fun, what are you talking about?

943
01:56:48,470 --> 01:56:52,159
That was actually fun.

944
01:56:52,159 --> 01:56:54,079
I very much enjoyed that.

945
01:56:54,079 --> 01:56:55,840
I mean, I played, I didn't play on hard mode.

946
01:56:55,840 --> 01:57:00,810
I played on like decent mode, which is fine.

947
01:57:00,810 --> 01:57:02,340
That's cool.

948
01:57:02,340 --> 01:57:07,109
Yeah, that was fun, what was it all about?

949
01:57:07,109 --> 01:57:09,710
That holds up really well considering it came out on DOS.

950
01:57:09,710 --> 01:57:14,380
This is a DOS game.

951
01:57:14,380 --> 01:57:16,979
That's a DOS game.

952
01:57:16,979 --> 01:57:19,100
I'm gonna go pee, I'll be right back.

953
01:57:19,140 --> 01:57:22,109
And then we'll do something else for like an hour or so.

954
01:57:22,109 --> 01:57:24,250
Something we can just play, just hang out.

955
01:57:24,250 --> 01:57:26,079
I'll be right back, let's figure it out.

956
01:57:26,079 --> 01:57:57,880
Put a poll in chat when I get back, I'll be right back.

957
01:57:57,880 --> 01:58:01,720
Sorry about that, I just probably scared the shit out of you.

958
01:58:01,720 --> 01:58:34,670
It was like, dude.

959
01:58:34,670 --> 01:58:36,149
Oh God, I know what we're doing when I get back.

960
01:58:36,149 --> 01:58:36,989
Are you kidding me?

961
01:58:36,989 --> 01:58:38,640
I know exactly what I'm doing.

962
01:58:38,640 --> 01:58:40,239
I don't even have to question this.

963
01:58:40,239 --> 01:58:44,359
I'm playing the vampire survivors update without a doubt.

964
01:58:44,359 --> 01:58:45,560
Yeah, I'll be right back.
