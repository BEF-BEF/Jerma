1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:13,220
I am I am not late at all. I am precisely on time precisely with a really fucked up voice as per usual

2
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:22,550
Hi, how are you? That was the first part of your week then hopefully it's been pretty good. How was your Monday?

3
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,609
How was your Tuesday? How was your weh? Ah?

4
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:30,109
Wait, it's not Wednesday that whole joke got ruined Wow

5
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:32,630
um I

6
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,700
Was gonna hold on. Let's try that again. How was your?

7
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:37,380
I

8
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:43,100
Already saw you on Wednesday. So let's do this again. How was your Thursday? How was your Friday? How was your Saturday?

9
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,340
How was you set up? We don't know yet. We'll find out soon enough

10
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:52,539
Hopefully we can have a good Sunday together. I actually thought it was Wednesday. Hello

11
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,520
That's the streamer mindset. I wasn't even a joke. It was me

12
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,439
Just got doing a little thing I did that you should be laughing because I don't know what day it is and

13
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:04,599
Not only do I not know what day it is. I was way off

14
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:08,719
Way off like not even remotely close

15
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:14,680
That's what you should be yellowing in the chat about not you know anything else. It's my voice sucks

16
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:20,459
I couldn't even do yellow well correctly. Do you hear this? I don't know what's wrong with me. I don't get it

17
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,900
There are any doctors in here

18
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:30,739
I went to the doctor about like having like junkie voice and like a junkie like painful kind of nose and I was getting

19
00:01:30,739 --> 00:01:34,859
Dizzy and shit. I go to the doctor. They put that camera tube up my nose

20
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:36,939
They do an MRI of my head in the brain and shit and they go

21
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:42,819
Oh, no, you just have like cysts all over inside of your mucus cavities. I mean they can cause those problems, but no

22
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:44,180
That's not what's happening

23
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:48,790
Take get it. Take them out. Take them out now get rid of them. I don't want them anymore

24
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:55,439
anyway

25
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:05,090
We're doing fine. We're doing just fine. Oh, they like it in there

26
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:15,639
You can't just take them out. No, I mean I can get them I can get surgery. It's so stupid like I

27
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,860
Almost look forward to when we're all just machines

28
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:26,610
Like I could keep our brains and keep our hearts because that's important, but honestly, ah

29
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:30,419
Mr. Elbertson, you've got a hernia

30
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:33,580
we're gonna have to fuck cut into you and cut all the flesh and shit and

31
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:39,020
Mucus membranes and then like pull it out cuz it's stuck there and then you know, that could be why your whole body hurts

32
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:46,740
Okay. Mr. Elbertson you have cysts in your nose and they're growing and they're huge and ugly and we need to cut them out with scissors

33
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:49,099
Whatever the hell they do

34
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:53,919
We need to be made out of steel and platinum and gold

35
00:02:54,439 --> 00:03:05,419
None of this flesh bullshit. It's stupid and it gets in the way. That was a big true. Somebody said that right now

36
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:17,389
Are you I'm just kidding my god, I can't I can I not go off on these as comedy rants anymore

37
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:25,139
But honest to God, yeah, I don't know why that you probably noticed it every so often the last six twelve months

38
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:28,340
I gotta figure out what I want to do about it

39
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:32,569
My vocal cords are fine. They've looked at those

40
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:37,330
It's just something going on up in where those cysts are that I'm just gonna have to get them taken out

41
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:41,000
but from

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,349
Wait, I'm not gonna announce it yet. Hold on. Hold on. We gotta wait for people to trickle in. What did you say?

43
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:52,909
Would you let raccoons do surgery on you?

44
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,449
Does the raccoon have his degree in surgery?

45
00:03:56,129 --> 00:03:58,219
Because yes, if that's the case

46
00:03:58,219 --> 00:04:08,840
If a raccoon can get through med school and get a degree in surgery, then why wouldn't you I mean they let rocket raccoon build

47
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,240
A bunch of spaceships. You don't think that he could if he wanted to become a doctor or something

48
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:26,470
What about a frog? Would you let a frog do surgery again?

49
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:31,189
If the frog went through med school, what what do I care?

50
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:43,139
Your hands are too slippery, but they somehow got through med school and got through surgery school

51
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:51,560
They get with gloves. Would you do would you do surgery on yourself?

52
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,300
No, because you're looking down. You can't really see that

53
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,899
Well, I wouldn't would be somebody we need to be doing it like on top of me right like like cut in the middle

54
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:06,500
You can't look down and like do that. It's not gonna happen

55
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,439
He's a mirror

56
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:16,100
at cameras exist, but

57
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:24,110
You're at you're referencing a ludicrous statement. I need another coffee

58
00:05:24,269 --> 00:05:28,829
It's like a two or three coffee day because I'll tell you got a major announcement for you

59
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:34,910
And I'm gonna pull back the jokiness because I'm actually gonna talk about a lot of serious things here

60
00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:43,170
But should I wait until there's like a ton of people here? Should I do this in the intro?

61
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,660
Maybe I'll wait

62
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:51,220
Let's wait for a little bit cuz if I feel like it's it's important enough to talk about it not like put on the

63
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,939
Jokey YouTube voice

64
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:55,939
I'll talk to you as me my real voice

65
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,040
That's how you know that we're getting serious

66
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:06,860
When I start talking like this, so no more Jokey voice. This is my real voice. That's how I actually talk

67
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:15,220
You're at 10k now. It's not enough. I'm in a weird mood today

68
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:33,060
I'm sorry, I just screamed at you. It's not an it's alright. Just hold on. I'm really excited today. Okay, I'm sorry

69
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:39,610
Compressor just fought with you. Wait, did it like screw that up?

70
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:47,990
Do AI dungeon what we're gonna do a house builder first cuz it popped up

71
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:53,540
I had a plan to play AI dungeon and novel AI today and

72
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:56,319
That's what I told everybody I was gonna do

73
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,639
Everybody was aware of that

74
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,839
Last second I saw a pop-up for house builder

75
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,480
So I changed every single one of my plans. That's what we're doing

76
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,420
It's still available though. We could still play it. It's ready to go

77
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:16,120
People were saying that I shouldn't play AI dungeon. I should play novel AI

78
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:23,759
It's AI dungeon got I got like nerfed or something like they they got it out some of the AI or something like that

79
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:34,560
I don't know but AI dungeon has kind of the quest thing, right? I'll try I'll do them both. Don't matter

80
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:43,339
Why is your mouse squeaking?

81
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:47,110
Wait, what do you mean my mouse squeaking? What do you mean?

82
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:55,680
Who's getting too expensive to run so they have yeah, I mean, I mean look Geo guesser is you have to pay for it now

83
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,480
too

84
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,689
right this

85
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:01,850
It's not that expensive. It's look if

86
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,009
It's like Geo guesser like a few dollars or something to play it

87
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:12,970
It's gonna support the people that make the game and support it and keep it running. Whatever that that's that's that's cool. That's fine

88
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:22,029
As long as it doesn't ever become like actually pay to

89
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:24,810
like win

90
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:32,190
Geo guesser is cheaper than subbing here. Yes, it is

91
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:41,940
Yeah, I got them both a to win Google Maps

92
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:47,659
All right. All right. It's time to mute the music

93
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,320
Time for the music to stop. I

94
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:53,000
Need to say something gonna talk about something

95
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,919
I gotta get this like other music out of my ear because I want to talk to you guys very much

96
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,289
to you

97
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:03,669
This has nothing to do by the way with the discord changes

98
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:06,190
This is a completely separate thing that I'm announcing

99
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,690
So it's not like I didn't plan on having like a bunch of huge discord

100
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:14,250
Changes and then like and by the way, here we go. That just kind of happened this way

101
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:20,649
Tell a fart joke. I'll tell a fart joke in the middle of this announcement to ruin it. How does that sound?

102
00:09:21,049 --> 00:09:34,759
How does that sound I can't win with this record? All right, my go XLR won't record it. So never mind

103
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,580
Alright, here we go. No more stalling. No more delaying. This is what I want to tell you

104
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:43,100
And then we're gonna talk about it for a little bit

105
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,539
So if you if you thought you were gonna go right into house builder, I got some news for you

106
00:09:47,539 --> 00:09:52,639
You got about five to ten minutes sitting here looking at this starting suing screen. Maybe not maybe a little bit less

107
00:09:52,919 --> 00:10:00,759
We just sit in the menu too. That's fine. Yeah, that's fine. So

108
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:09,120
What is the in five minutes is okay. So as you know, those of you that have been on this channel for a long time

109
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,710
Some of you for more than a decade, which is crazy

110
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:19,139
You know that sometimes I do very large streams whether that's the dollhouse whether that's

111
00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:24,820
The Halloween stream Bugleberry shows up sometimes. He's a good friend of mine, by the way, good friend of mine

112
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:32,840
baseball other stuff that I really want to do it's starting the bills are starting to add up and

113
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:40,360
Over the next kind of arc of my career here, which I'll be honest

114
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:47,759
I kind of want to make this like the like the big one what is happening now

115
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:53,419
As I've decided going back and forth and talking with various people and various things

116
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:59,320
I am now signed with evolved. I'm now under the evolved umbrella

117
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:08,519
Evolved is the company that represents XQC in a talent agency way

118
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:19,860
Also, cutie Cinderella, I think Austin show and a shitload of eSports players, right? So why why why are you doing this?

119
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:24,299
Whoa, whoa. Whoa. Oh, wait a minute. This dude's now all of a sudden. He's like signed with a talent agency

120
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:30,299
He blew up his discord and like now what the fuck what corporate Andy is taking over. Is that what's happening?

121
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:38,480
No, just wait everybody. Hold everybody settle down settle down. I need I want to make this really clear

122
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:45,039
He's becoming a CS go pro. What if that was the announcement?

123
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:55,169
What if no, that would be so dumb

124
00:11:55,409 --> 00:12:00,809
That would be so that would be such a bad dumb move for me because I don't play CS go and I'm not very good

125
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:14,500
It what's below bronze is there a wood like I would be wood rank in League of Legends or whatever it is plastic

126
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,419
so

127
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:26,019
essentially what this means is that there's now a lot there's gonna be a lot of opportunities now to tap into potential sponsorships and

128
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,830
brands and

129
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,870
money and

130
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,649
Making money from these different avenues and stuff, right?

131
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:41,389
But I gotta be really clear about this the big shows cost a lot of money and we struggled

132
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:43,389
I was I was actually thinking about having Jake

133
00:12:43,669 --> 00:12:48,870
Community Jake come on here and talk about this with me because he's a lot more well-spoken than I am and a lot of things

134
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:51,889
but I

135
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:57,879
I'll be very transparent with you guys the streams that you see from time to time

136
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:05,149
They rack up and have racked up hundreds of thousands of dollars in bills over the last few years

137
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,870
dollhouse alone was an

138
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:18,789
Unbelievable amount of money and I have to start to think about as I go into this kind of this arc of my online

139
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:22,149
Entertainment life for whatever you want to call it e clown world

140
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:27,480
I have to start to be able to pay for these things and I could I maybe pay for them

141
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,120
Oh, I probably could it would be pretty bad though

142
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,950
I think over another few years of doing this it might actually not be a good thing

143
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:41,360
So I'm opening the idea of being able to have a bigger dialogue with sponsors

144
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,600
Be signed with a talent agency so they can handle this shit. They come to me. They say hey, dude

145
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
You want to do for instance?

146
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:54,440
You guys are I've talked about it a thousand times. So I'm just gonna talk about it again

147
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:03,139
I want to do Jerma rumble live on twitch, right? I want to do Jerma rumble live live and

148
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:11,850
That show is going to be an absolute metric fucking huge amount of money to be able to do stuff like that

149
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:19,740
I need to have the capital to be able to do it and I'm going to only take sponsorships and only take money from places

150
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:22,179
That I know that I'll have control

151
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:26,899
Streams are not gonna change. It's I'm not gonna do like fucking like

152
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:34,549
Laundry detergent tweets once a week that's not happening as I tweet like five times a fucking year

153
00:14:34,549 --> 00:14:37,549
Anyways, you think I'm really who wants me to do tweets for their business

154
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:43,769
But I have to start to think about this stuff and I have to really start to take into consideration

155
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:49,039
That there are companies that their whole goal is to make you

156
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:51,519
money for stuff and

157
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:58,960
Sponsorships and bring brands in we it was a painful experience to get the dollhouse paid for a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff

158
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:05,879
You guys don't know about that show that was very very very difficult to have happen. I want to try to eliminate that

159
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:11,940
I want to make it easier on

160
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:17,059
production on people that are showing up on myself to not have to kind of

161
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:24,700
Drag their heels into the ground trying to figure out how we're gonna pay for a show and some of you might be saying

162
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:29,600
right, maybe not maybe not something maybe I'm just making you up, but that's fine. I want to say this anyways is

163
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:35,850
Well, then what just don't do the shows like don't just don't do the big shows if they're this much of a

164
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:39,529
Financial kind of burden in a lot of ways don't do them. Just don't do them

165
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,240
We don't need them. I have to be very honest with you

166
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:50,740
If I wasn't doing the big shows, I would have quit two or three years ago

167
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:57,779
I would have retired years ago and I made a very very important statement over the last three or four years

168
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:08,000
The if I'm not interested, I'm not gonna stay and yeah the the the replacement stream joke

169
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:10,139
That was that was a joke

170
00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:11,759
but you know

171
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:19,629
I have to really think about how I'm gonna stay interested and that is what interests me doing like German rumble live is

172
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:26,379
What I am interested in doing doing baseball is what keeps me interested

173
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:35,009
And if these things weren't here and I wasn't actively on a daily weekly basis trying to you know

174
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:42,269
Get these shows off the ground. I probably would have stopped. He actually hates streaming

175
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:49,200
He actually hates no, that's not what I'm saying. No, I love streaming

176
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,919
I what are you talking about?

177
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:54,879
You would have seen the shows the the projects the events

178
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:57,080
That's what I'd live for right now, right?

179
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:05,210
But this stuff has to get paid for and if that especially if I want to do them as more often like you've been seeing

180
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:07,579
It's been pretty much

181
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:11,450
Every what like three or four months every like few months

182
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:15,700
There's like something that's not like just like kind of sitting in a like a desk stream, right?

183
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:23,509
So what evolved is gonna do is they're gonna come in and they're gonna connect me to brands and to people that hey

184
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:28,130
You know what? Uh, yeah that stream that you want to do sounds like really fun and really cool

185
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:34,960
We'll give you money for it. That's the whole purpose of this and I know I said it was gonna be five minutes

186
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,480
And I know it's been like 15. Ah

187
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:49,539
Also, let me make I'm gonna give you some hard lines here for you to understand if I will not have

188
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,880
complete direct control over

189
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:59,460
Everything I will not take a sponsor a lot of people wouldn't when they saw the coinbase sponsor

190
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:04,779
They thought that it was like holy shit. Oh my god. The stream is ruined

191
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:10,779
He's gonna be shilling coins and NFTs. That's not gonna happen. That is not going to happen

192
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:15,940
Let me be very clear with everybody that is not ever going to happen

193
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:21,950
If I do not have exact direct control of everything, it's not happening

194
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,380
I'll say no, thank you

195
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:33,299
But that's where that stands if you see a sponsor on this channel over the coming months

196
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,410
It's because of a few reasons reason number one

197
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:40,029
fucking

198
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:43,069
Reason number two

199
00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:50,299
What was it? Oh, I'm paying for shows. No, I mean, I'm just fucking around but seriously

200
00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:59,849
Reason number one and pretty much the only reason is to make money to pay for the big stuff and the big stuff is

201
00:19:00,009 --> 00:19:07,839
Very expensive. I'm not trying to make a shitload of money from sponsors to take and put in my personal bank account

202
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:10,089
I want to pay for shows

203
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:14,180
I want to be able to pay the people on the shows and be able to do them without

204
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:20,279
stressing myself out financially or sitting there in the middle of like our dollhouse production going

205
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,319
Okay, we fucking need money or this isn't happening. I want that to not happen ever again

206
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:33,569
So I I think that it's a good fit

207
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:38,559
Yeah, and we'll see going forward. It's gonna be

208
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,640
It's gonna see how much I like it

209
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:49,349
I'm very very happy with what they've said so far and I hopefully the relationship like in a business wise can flourish and

210
00:19:50,069 --> 00:20:00,079
Evolved can come in and help out this channel and you guys will see what they do also

211
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:04,849
I know five minutes. I know another important thing to understand is

212
00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:12,630
I if I'm gonna do a huge show that's gonna cost tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars

213
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:18,609
I don't want that to be a financial burden on the community, right?

214
00:20:18,609 --> 00:20:21,519
Like I don't want to have to be like oh shit

215
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:26,160
Well, I really should like really need some more subs this month. Otherwise, it's gonna be hard to do

216
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:32,079
It's gonna be hard to do that the playground stream and we get a bunch of playground equipment and we do like

217
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,799
Olympic level playground equipment

218
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:38,759
Competitions like right that's not happening that I just made that up

219
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,740
But that's my you know

220
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,059
I mean like I don't want to have to I would rather it be a sponsor comes in

221
00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:50,180
Drops a bunch of money and it's I don't have it's not like the burden is not put on either me or me needing to kind

222
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,180
Of tell everybody

223
00:20:54,579 --> 00:20:56,059
20k

224
00:20:56,059 --> 00:21:02,400
Cuz I don't want to do that

225
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,400
And I've never ever this is five minute Andy

226
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,779
The only time that a stream or a YouTube video really has ever been sponsored

227
00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:17,440
It has been dollhouse that I never really have ever done a sponsorship. Maybe one

228
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:21,140
Back in like the YouTube days. I don't even like remember it's been so long

229
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:26,029
but all the major streams that you see all the major videos guys, I

230
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:33,369
Liquidated my 401k to make the German rumble video

231
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:36,210
That's a that's a story you've heard many times

232
00:21:36,569 --> 00:21:39,880
So it's not I

233
00:21:41,069 --> 00:21:45,500
Need to start to think about who is gonna pay for these things and if it's gonna be me

234
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,569
You know who knows maybe I'm like maybe I'm not brand friendly

235
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,369
What I will will find the right brands, right?

236
00:21:52,470 --> 00:22:01,289
This plunge of companies that I've talked really highly of we won't know who who is going to

237
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,990
He says fuck all the time

238
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:15,279
But you know, there's there's a lot of opportunity I just want don't want people to think that this is now

239
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:23,039
Oh, he's cash it out. He's getting kind of the end of his like career. So he's putting all the chips on the table

240
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,559
Hey, fuck this whole thing. I'm pulling out all this money. No, that's not happening. I

241
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,529
just want to be able to pay for shows and

242
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:34,910
However, we can do that if I need to do some sponsorships if you see it here in there

243
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:38,930
That's what's gonna happen. It's gonna be I'm gonna make sure it's stuff that I really want to do though

244
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:47,049
Which makes hey, excuse me all all advertisers. Excuse me all advertisers, please pay attention

245
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:53,819
Don't you think that makes this this channel way more fucking valuable? Wait, he's only had wait

246
00:22:53,819 --> 00:22:56,539
He's only had one sponsor ever. Oh

247
00:22:57,529 --> 00:23:03,430
Like we can get on there. Give him 10 million. Give him 20 million. Give him 30 million, right?

248
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,430
Like that's pretty valuable

249
00:23:09,579 --> 00:23:12,339
He expects 20 million dollars. No

250
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:19,849
He's so fucked up, but I'm only gonna start today

251
00:23:19,849 --> 00:23:24,009
I'm gonna take sponsors from things that I really want to take sponsors from and I'm gonna have control and

252
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:32,559
Evolved has been very very upfront. They said dude. We get it this music. This has been the music that's been on the whole time

253
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:41,539
What is this like church music? Oh my god, turn that off. It's I'm in a boy. It's not bad

254
00:23:41,539 --> 00:23:48,180
It's like nights like it's nice music, but I feel like okay. He says he's gonna use it for big shows

255
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:52,259
He's gonna use it to pay. No, this is

256
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:54,779
televangelist inspirational bullshit

257
00:23:57,799 --> 00:23:59,799
It

258
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:01,960
Really does feel like I'm a televangelist

259
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:08,640
I am asking you I am set talking about money and where money is gonna come from to the to the church to the congregation

260
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:14,700
You know, I'm sorry everybody what I have to start to think about here is

261
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:21,069
How we're gonna make the church grow even bigger than it is now and we do that

262
00:24:21,589 --> 00:24:24,309
By talking about this company here as you see I

263
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,960
Can't I don't want to make a joke about a sponsor because like I'm like sponsor Andy now, right?

264
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:35,579
Oh, that's off-limits. Can't talk about that. I can't bring up this company. Okay, just in case they ever were interested

265
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:41,099
People like okay, but if all it doesn't know just don't tell them

266
00:24:42,579 --> 00:24:46,859
What they don't know is like they're gonna come to me with sponsor people

267
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:50,500
Hey, we've got this deal for you. Maybe it'll make you a really good amount of money

268
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:55,099
You can take this and then like all that show in fucking June is gonna be awesome. Okay, sure

269
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,700
What was the company again? Oh

270
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,140
Let me let me give you a list of all the companies that are interested

271
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:06,759
Okay. Well, I told that company that they suck. I told that company to fuck off. I said fuck that company

272
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:11,599
I said this company makes disgusting dogshit products. Um, I can't use any of these

273
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:19,910
Wait what? Yeah, unless you come in at me with like hamburger helper

274
00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:28,640
Or like McDonald's is the only two companies have ever spoken highly of you said to know other companies have ever talked highly of

275
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,369
If you like jet blue

276
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:33,529
Well, there you go. This is your criteria

277
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,569
And for your helper he'll and

278
00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:39,849
Chuck E cheese

279
00:25:39,849 --> 00:25:49,940
Please don't do NFT guys. I okay turn the funny music off. Let me just be really clear. Yes

280
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,240
You guys know that I've had I had the coinbase sponsor. Yes. I've been involved in crypto over the years

281
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,369
You understand that right? But I'm not going to do that

282
00:25:59,369 --> 00:26:04,569
I'm not gonna I don't I'm not gonna jump into like the NFT game now that I have a sponsorship

283
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:10,789
That's not gonna happen. I'm not gonna do that. I have no interest in NFTs. I have I don't care about them

284
00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:13,430
I don't I don't focus on them at all. It's nothing that I care about

285
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:22,799
I have no interest at all. So I gotta make that because people people are probably gonna think that like if I tell he's gonna start

286
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:27,059
Taking sponsorships. He's gonna he wants to take big money sponsorships. He took a coinbase sponsorship

287
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:33,640
No, I am in control of what I want to do and I have no interest in that space at all

288
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:38,410
I just don't so

289
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:50,480
I've seen that pop up in chat a little bit and I want to make sure that that's people understand that is it true

290
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,900
What about subway? I mean I have I talked bet. Okay, you guys have to do me a favor here

291
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:59,349
Well, I mean we need to kind of come up with all the companies that I've spoken highly of right

292
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:06,890
imagine being like a brand person for one of these companies and you go to this you pay a bunch of money to have this like

293
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:09,319
streamer do this shit and

294
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:16,759
Somebody links you a clip of them like taking a bite of your of your most famous sandwich and saying this is dogshit into the camera

295
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:23,890
All right. All right. I know I know I've been sitting for like 20 minutes

296
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:29,769
it's important though to write and I want to touch upon the discord stuff as well because I've seen a lot of people kind of

297
00:27:30,329 --> 00:27:38,369
Talk about what the fuck is happening on the discord. I I need to start to get some of these places more manageable for me and

298
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:41,490
Over the last few months

299
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:47,029
I've been trying to figure out how to do that how to make the discord the cleaner experience for me better for the mods

300
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,829
Better for me to manage because at the end of the day

301
00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:54,170
It's it's the German 985 official discord

302
00:27:54,170 --> 00:28:00,130
Which the buck stops at my desk and I kind of have to see how things go there. We've seen problems there

303
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:03,130
We've seen great incredible things come from that space, right?

304
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:08,200
I have to try to get it to where I can pay attention to it to where I can manage it

305
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:14,960
Have a group of mods that can think it can manage it with me. You're gonna get TV burning

306
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:22,230
Look, there's a few important things going on and no, I'm sorry. There's like little sparkles going on over here

307
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,470
So it's gonna be fine

308
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:32,650
It's not gonna burn into my monitor as this channel kind of changes and as this channel

309
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:38,240
Evolves you're gonna there'll be some things you'll see that are changing and

310
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,960
Like I said, I'm trying to keep myself interested

311
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,480
I'm trying to keep myself connected to the space as best as I can

312
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,119
You can't minus to the new agency that has signed to me. That's not how it works

313
00:28:52,089 --> 00:28:53,569
But as we go forward here

314
00:28:53,569 --> 00:29:00,470
I need to find ways to make it so I can disconnect because you guys have known this for the last

315
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:08,650
Most almost 11 plus years of being around I disconnect I don't interact that much and that's very much by design

316
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:13,200
I need to disconnect. Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to do it for this long

317
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:19,240
The constant kind of stress and the constant awareness of having a community this big is

318
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,529
my way of handling it is

319
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:31,069
To not to really disconnect from it a lot of times and I mean, like I said, I don't tweet that much

320
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:32,349
I'm not on social media that much

321
00:29:32,349 --> 00:29:38,599
So in the spaces that I'm you know, officially a part of that I officially own going forward here, too

322
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:44,200
Not just on discord on twitch on you know, the YouTube space on like the sponsor space

323
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:52,589
I gotta get it under control because I'm not really that much of a participant. Please play dude. The edibles are kicking in

324
00:29:52,589 --> 00:29:56,579
Oh shit that guy that do art that one guy

325
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:04,779
Was like ready for house builder and it's pissed because we've been sitting here for 25 plus minutes

326
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:09,980
Talking about like the state of the channel in the community and shit and this guy is sitting here

327
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:15,140
sinking into his couch and like starting to the world is zoning out and

328
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:20,019
He's sitting there going to please pick up the fucking cement truck and just dump the cement dude

329
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:25,809
This is too much for my fucking brain. What do you got son? What do you mean Italian? He's evolving

330
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:31,019
No, I don't want an evolved version of this fucking weirdo. No. No, I'm leaving the community

331
00:30:31,019 --> 00:30:37,539
I just that person just left the community that person thinks I'm like turning into like a new Pokemon or something

332
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:40,869
Like I just fucked it very TLDR

333
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,559
Sponsorships are gonna become a thing now. I want to pay for big streams some of the biggest streams I've ever done

334
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:55,849
Even more large in scale than the dollhouse are currently underway. I'm gotta I've got I gotta believe

335
00:30:56,130 --> 00:31:11,200
All right, let's go. All the things that I'm doing are trying to make my life a little easier. That's it. Okay, you fucking criticize me

336
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:23,890
You're gone. I will ban you fucking permanently with the click of one of my fucking fingers. So watch it. Okay

337
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:31,880
All right house builder, this is not like house flipper. It's different

338
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:35,200
You build the houses rather than flip them this game

339
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:38,440
Might be dog. You know what?

340
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:45,200
We're turning over a new leaf because at some point, you know, you got a can't just say that about anything that I come across

341
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:55,670
Corporate Andy, let's go. All right, we're gonna start. I think you start small. You can't say anything bad about anyone anymore

342
00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:06,009
Hey evolved. I'll give you a list. Okay, I'll give you a nice list. This is an igloo house. It's easy

343
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:17,490
This is a mud house and it's easy it's the only two I can do and now let's put on that youtuber voice

344
00:32:17,829 --> 00:32:24,390
Should have a face cam. No, maybe in a minute. Maybe if you're good the igloo

345
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:34,890
We're gonna learn to play about instead of a house. We build a home. I'm that person up for 30 minutes

346
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,039
Good to see you builder. I hope the weather won't scare you off. Let's be honest

347
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,099
That's a tough job as you probably know we build all around the world

348
00:32:51,099 --> 00:32:55,240
You might expect bigger buildings more mechanics and construction challenges in the future

349
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,559
But for now, let's see how you handle it. Have fun a

350
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:07,369
Little loud for me, but it's probably not loud for you. Is it? Oh, we have a dog. Can we pet the dog?

351
00:33:07,369 --> 00:33:15,589
I mean kind of start building the igloo. You must first cut out ice blocks

352
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:24,839
What to do this grab the highlighted bone knife and come near the ice quarry and while holding the left mouse button draw a

353
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,259
Contour along the scratch on the ice

354
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:33,440
What it just jump scared me?

355
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,000
Okay, snow bricks

356
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,759
What? Okay, so pick up the ice block. Oh

357
00:33:48,000 --> 00:34:00,250
Pick up the knife. Oh, there's a knife. It's like a melee weapon get closer to the source of ice

358
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:12,190
This is the source of ice. I mean isn't ice just literally surrounding us. It's so bright. It's so bright

359
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:17,320
I think I'm gonna need to put on some HD glasses some brightness reducing glasses

360
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:25,309
Thankfully, I'm open to sponsorships now. I wonder what kind I would put on. I wonder what brand I would be using

361
00:34:25,809 --> 00:34:29,190
God really need them now own

362
00:34:29,809 --> 00:34:34,929
Igloo knife before you start you'll have to find an igloo bone knife press e to grab it. Okay

363
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:40,250
You already have a knife in your hands draw a contour along visible track on the ice

364
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:52,130
While holding left when you see there's no more ice on the hole. You have to look for another source. What we're here

365
00:34:52,550 --> 00:35:09,309
Whoa. Oh shit. Okay, cool new skill available. Oh my god

366
00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:14,400
It's like the path of exile skill tree

367
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:21,489
This is bigger than path of exile. Let me see. This isn't accurate at all

368
00:35:21,809 --> 00:35:26,570
You know what else isn't accurate at all not well, I was gonna say not I thought I didn't have I thought I didn't have

369
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:28,570
The love zone never mind joke ruined

370
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:38,099
With this skill you will cut two times more snow blocks at the same time. Okay, I got it two times more snow blocks

371
00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:45,000
Cut ice for the new snow blocks. All right, let's go

372
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:53,179
Doesn't matter how sloppy it is. Oh

373
00:35:53,579 --> 00:36:03,739
Dude, it's I got two. Ooh

374
00:36:03,739 --> 00:36:07,820
The bonfire is dying you have to throw more sticks into the fire or you will freeze

375
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,789
Wait, we can I can die

376
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:21,809
Get more sticks in there. How much to show to use? Wait, am I using way too much? Oh shit

377
00:36:21,809 --> 00:36:28,510
I'm like, I'm the guy that you don't want to survive with the better. All right more ice

378
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:41,039
Yo, man, I got if we burn a hundred sticks. We'll get a huge fire. It'll be really warm

379
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:54,449
Eat that guy first, okay skill tree. Yeah to start building the igloo. You must first cut I already did this

380
00:36:57,139 --> 00:37:06,440
Okay, I'm just gonna cut ice for a little while. All right. Why would I go back and forth? This one's empty

381
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:13,039
What they're telling you because you're doing an awful job

382
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:17,780
Well, I'm gonna get awful job this one square meter that I can cut ice out

383
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:29,989
This game is fucking sick. By the way, I thought I was gonna be building houses in like a

384
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:33,789
Good neighborhood or something. This is actually cool. You have to like

385
00:37:34,429 --> 00:37:45,579
Make your way build your way up to that. How much can I carry? This is an IRL scream

386
00:37:45,579 --> 00:37:50,119
I hope nobody ever does an IRL scream like this. I feel like I'd be terrified the whole time

387
00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:58,210
Okay, so now

388
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,809
with my blocks

389
00:37:59,809 --> 00:38:04,309
Whoo? I got a new skill

390
00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:12,889
It's kind of a cereal box game, but I actually really like it. I'm gonna be honest

391
00:38:12,889 --> 00:38:21,519
I got new skills with this skill. You will cut six times more blocks

392
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:33,610
Yeah, this is this is this is definitely like I like a cereal box game

393
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:38,849
This is like the CD that comes in the cereal box, but you know what some of those games are actually really good

394
00:38:39,409 --> 00:38:51,800
Whoa, I love it. It's so easy. It's a simple

395
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:58,480
By the way, please make sure you join me for my Elden Ring launch party

396
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:06,869
Probably like four or five o'clock like maybe 16 hours into the launch

397
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:11,769
Be one of the last streamers, you know playing it. I would probably assure you of that

398
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:27,090
All right, what about this? Oh, I can sprint 30% faster. Okay, cool. What's wrong?

399
00:39:27,929 --> 00:39:31,199
What is the dog doing?

400
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:39,559
It's not trying to add oxygen to the fire. Good boy. I have to hurry up

401
00:39:39,559 --> 00:39:55,139
Oh go go go go. I gotta get this done before nightfall

402
00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:08,880
Shit, how is it at 0%? How is it at 0%?

403
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:23,460
Wait, wait, wait sprint away igloo. Okay, 15 times more blocks. Nice. How far can I go?

404
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:31,150
We've got some sections here. Oh

405
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:34,309
That was so satisfying. It's like a little marshmallows. I

406
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:48,699
Just gotta collect blocks already 40. How many should I get?

407
00:40:50,750 --> 00:41:02,119
Come on stop this game actually runs really well

408
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:12,039
Don't you think this is one of those games that should run at like eight frames a second all these games run like shit

409
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:26,179
So it's actually kind of surprising almost done. I get the roof. It's games from tooth. Yeah

410
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:35,679
Just give him 2011 no, it's not it came out like it last year or something. I don't build the roof

411
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:43,940
Not building the igloo. You must first cut ice blocks. I know that's right. How do I jump up here? Can I go in?

412
00:41:46,170 --> 00:42:01,039
Scratch, okay. This is a really really funny igloo. I don't know how to twitch chat integration. That's funny. I'm killing it right now. I

413
00:42:03,269 --> 00:42:04,869
Got it. I got it. I got it

414
00:42:04,869 --> 00:42:16,900
Well, can't you go like get us a rabbit or something like go go get us like some food. What do you come on?

415
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:33,719
You're wasting wood. It's fine. We're gonna be surviving in there. Anyways, we'll find a rascally rabbit. I

416
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:50,579
Don't even know if there's another one. Nice. I think the wood respawns. Oh, okay. That's good

417
00:42:51,219 --> 00:42:54,039
Thanks for quelling my fears. I

418
00:42:54,159 --> 00:43:00,739
Think that should be good 50. Yeah, that's good

419
00:43:01,019 --> 00:43:12,110
The new Samsung smart fridge has switch integration and Skyrim integration talk to the fans about that

420
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:16,440
Yeah, I just said that without you paying me to say that

421
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,599
How dare you?

422
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:21,840
Please reach out to my evolved representative, please

423
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:24,360
for a

424
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:33,449
retroactive payment I

425
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:41,719
Gotta get inside. I thought it was 365 degrees in here

426
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:52,929
I was like what how many ice blocks does it take to do this?

427
00:43:53,489 --> 00:44:07,159
Goodness, okay. I need more your characters arm is identical to a character in the Incredibles

428
00:44:07,159 --> 00:44:21,920
I I've never seen the Incredibles. No, I haven't I know I know that's like saying I've never seen Star Wars, right?

429
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:30,579
The last what was the I think the last Disney Pixar movie that I saw was Meet the Robinsons

430
00:44:31,059 --> 00:44:37,449
The only reason why I watched that movie is because I thought the bowler hat guy was funny and cool and like I wanted

431
00:44:37,449 --> 00:44:42,159
To see his scenes only in fact now that I'm remembering this

432
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:45,880
I think I just went to like YouTube and typed in all the bowler hat guys scenes

433
00:44:46,320 --> 00:45:01,250
And didn't even watch the movie. Oh, no, I think I saw it. I think I watched it. I got it. Don't worry

434
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:17,250
All right, we're almost done. No, it was a nice movie. I especially like the trailer when the dinosaur goes

435
00:45:18,659 --> 00:45:25,699
Big hand new arms. I did

436
00:45:26,539 --> 00:45:35,710
We have to driveway press O to open the shop. Whoa

437
00:45:36,469 --> 00:45:49,769
Wooden barricade, where should I put this? Am I supposed to be doing this?

438
00:45:58,619 --> 00:46:02,300
To build an entrance to the igloo you can build one in the same way you built it

439
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:13,559
I can move it, but where does it want me to put it nice?

440
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:15,400
more

441
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:21,190
Where am I supposed to put this? I can't move it anywhere else. Do you mean it's like I can't

442
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:25,840
Okay, it was stuck on there. That was weird

443
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:40,480
Can only build one to go. All right. All right. Look arc

444
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:47,360
You're playing arc survival evolved. I like that name

445
00:46:53,090 --> 00:47:00,360
I'm sorry. It's so bad. It's so bad

446
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:10,190
It's a jump to how about destiny to that was hard. That was a really hard game

447
00:47:10,789 --> 00:47:28,079
This doesn't have really good feng shui. Sorry, the igloo doesn't have

448
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:34,429
Like what do you want? How do you want me to feng shui this?

449
00:47:34,989 --> 00:47:47,280
Looks like the igloo got punched in the face and lost a few teeth. That's it. Oh

450
00:47:48,739 --> 00:47:53,539
Cool. I did it. I got five stars. I did in 13 minutes. I ran

451
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:56,840
986 miles. Oh

452
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:18,699
Wait, stay here. Nice. This is a pizza oven. Okay, what's next? There are gunshots

453
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:22,210
All right, so let's go

454
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:25,820
Report a bug. No, no, no. How do I leave here?

455
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:32,980
exit save

456
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:39,280
Go to the main menu. Yeah

457
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:48,349
Okay, play I did this one. Nice. So what is any other things open up or do I have to go to the other one?

458
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:56,829
This is a mud house and it's a level medium. Looks like we're gonna start to include some wood

459
00:48:57,389 --> 00:49:08,579
Here comes primitive technology German

460
00:49:09,099 --> 00:49:12,429
Fun fact, you don't give up easily. Do you?

461
00:49:12,869 --> 00:49:18,869
Do you I thought I said it twice like do you good as another challenge awaits you hope you brought an insect spray

462
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:23,550
You may need it. We heard some stories about a hungry lion around here. Let's get the job done quickly

463
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:25,269
So we don't have to face him

464
00:49:25,269 --> 00:49:27,619
What?

465
00:49:27,619 --> 00:49:29,699
We still have a dog

466
00:49:29,699 --> 00:49:34,500
Okay, the first step is to lay stone foundations

467
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:39,860
Look around for stones in appropriate size collect the required amount and put them in the right places. Alright, so here's a stone

468
00:49:40,699 --> 00:49:43,579
Okay, so let's get rocks

469
00:49:46,179 --> 00:49:48,179
using a player sense

470
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:52,960
Wait, I oh

471
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,960
I have like I

472
00:49:55,079 --> 00:49:57,079
Have like hitman vision

473
00:49:57,079 --> 00:50:01,440
Jim the skill increase your strength by 50%

474
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:07,900
You can carry more materials with you in the tray without having to throw them away. Oh, that's a big deal. No

475
00:50:08,519 --> 00:50:12,659
Alright, so we're gonna find rocks. Let's go look around collecting rocks

476
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:25,150
My gamer vision this game's awesome. Is it can I actually get attacked by a lion?

477
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:34,750
Okay, this is just MMO quest without the quest givers

478
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:39,730
I just have to go get like a hundred rocks and just go bring a hundred rocks here. I

479
00:50:42,099 --> 00:50:55,750
Actually kind of like it. It's just arc. I mean, it's not really arc

480
00:50:56,170 --> 00:51:11,659
This is probably more like lost arc than it is arc. This is a baby sensory game. It kind of feels like it

481
00:51:12,019 --> 00:51:19,659
Good one. Thanks. I know that game is very relevant right now. It's my relevant game relevant gamer Andy

482
00:51:24,309 --> 00:51:27,769
I'm just gonna do this for a little while. I

483
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:34,780
Kind of hope you can actually get attacked by a lion that would make the game a full letter grade higher for me

484
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,119
14

485
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:44,000
What if I can't do it? I don't have enough

486
00:51:44,719 --> 00:51:48,599
Games really relaxing. Yeah, this game's good

487
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:51,400
This is it actually

488
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:57,710
all told our judgments, but I mean this is I like this just

489
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:14,769
Collect thing and bring thing here. It's so easy for me to understand one more. All right level up

490
00:52:17,219 --> 00:52:18,780
Pick up the axe

491
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:26,050
What get closer to a palm tree with the axe equipped this melee attacks in this game?

492
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:37,559
Cut the palm tree down. Wow. Oh it falls into pieces

493
00:52:38,199 --> 00:52:43,639
Pick up the log with E

494
00:52:43,639 --> 00:52:45,619
Okay, cool

495
00:52:45,619 --> 00:52:49,269
Um pick up a log. Wait, did I not?

496
00:52:49,789 --> 00:53:11,000
There's no way to go. There's no way to do. I need to use my gamer sense. Thank you. Let it go

497
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:21,489
What oh I got to cut it. Are you serious?

498
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:33,210
Whoa, why am I talking like this is some huge innovation? Okay now

499
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:40,130
Some of these sticks up. I need more trees. Ah

500
00:53:42,139 --> 00:53:54,480
You sound like you're experiencing life for the first time. It's kind of interesting

501
00:53:55,079 --> 00:54:04,739
As go look at the steam store page for this. It's like cement trucks and shit

502
00:54:04,739 --> 00:54:06,880
We are this is we're just scratching the surface

503
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:19,070
skill up

504
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:21,369
Faster tree cutting I'm gonna say oh

505
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,320
60% faster run speed

506
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,880
We're in a 30-second loop

507
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:51,559
Yeah, but it's a fun 30-second loop gameplay loops are okay if they're fun. They cut the music really didn't it still here

508
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:55,369
Alright, here we go. One two

509
00:54:56,170 --> 00:54:57,409
There it is

510
00:54:57,409 --> 00:55:00,159
New skill now, what do I do? Wait, there's more

511
00:55:00,719 --> 00:55:10,469
The skill allow you to chop palms faster. Yep, where you do the same thing over and over again. Yeah, that's kind of it's relaxing

512
00:55:10,469 --> 00:55:11,630
I like it

513
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:21,480
There are more trees

514
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:24,550
DMCA one turn on the furnace

515
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:37,710
What is there a free demo version of this game? I I don't know. What is this? I've like logs already here

516
00:55:38,409 --> 00:55:50,679
Living in the 21st century doing something mean to it. What are you saying?

517
00:55:53,849 --> 00:55:58,210
Living in the 21st century doing something mean to it better than anybody you ever seen screams from the haters

518
00:55:58,929 --> 00:56:03,590
those are the lyrics I

519
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,960
Don't listen to any music

520
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:15,920
Because I think the last piece of music I listened to was like one of the attack on Titan intro songs

521
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:23,539
That's it that's it and then before that I think it was a radio on the radio I

522
00:56:24,019 --> 00:56:38,039
Have a lot of these Twines

523
00:56:38,199 --> 00:56:49,909
It's actually it's pretty helpful because it's kind of how it works, right? This is how you build a house

524
00:56:57,579 --> 00:57:01,420
There there ain't no more trees I've cut them all down

525
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:11,610
Music's annoying me

526
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:15,409
Relax, it's you know, if you want to listen to like another 10 minutes

527
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:18,469
What's right? I like it. I think it's good

528
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:37,139
All right. Here we go. I think that should be in a good spot. Now we have to get those

529
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:40,940
Keep the construction from falling apart

530
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:46,659
You need to you need to tie logs together using rope made of tropical tree bark as you cut down trees

531
00:57:46,659 --> 00:57:51,300
You may all have also found some tropical rope to collect the required amount and put it in the correct place

532
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:53,460
All right

533
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:56,920
Let's go

534
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:09,139
Build. Oh, there it is. Hey that tied it together. I

535
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:13,599
Did it?

536
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:19,260
Support for roof tiles in this stage. You also need palm logs collect them by cutting down trees as before

537
00:58:19,679 --> 00:58:21,119
Do I have any?

538
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:26,659
Still have a few shit. I need more trees

539
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:34,199
That voice sounds like Joel

540
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:48,440
It does hold on. It sounds like Joel. I need to hear it. Let me just cut down a shit load of trees

541
00:58:49,119 --> 00:59:02,840
Somebody just said fuck SNL and the whole cast what what are you talking about? What are you? Why saying that?

542
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,360
This is German. I need five

543
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:11,159
This is German stream. What what are you? Why are you saying that what happened? What are you doing? What happened?

544
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:21,889
Why are you saying that about I what does that do that? What does it do with me? I?

545
00:59:28,119 --> 00:59:31,880
Keep thinking you guys are talking. All right. I'm so out of the loop with everything

546
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:35,650
completely out of the loop

547
00:59:35,849 --> 00:59:40,679
100% I thought there's some guys coming in here going like hey, by the way, dude

548
00:59:40,679 --> 00:59:44,920
Like fuck SNL and like fuck the whole bell cast just like all right, man, like what?

549
00:59:45,699 --> 00:59:48,389
What do you want me to do about it? Why are you saying that to me?

550
00:59:48,989 --> 01:00:07,840
I think there's enough trees rip the SNL sponsorship. I got it. You know what?

551
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:16,019
What are some sponsorships that I really would actually want? What should I say? What what should I get? What should I try to get?

552
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:18,250
biggest thing

553
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:21,789
Something that makes sense to me something that it makes sense to me

554
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:38,480
Donald's I would do that. Yeah, I would we I literally did that last stream and this is before

555
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:44,280
Doing anything with like a sponsorship or anything. I literally did a big a full like 10-minute McDonald's ad

556
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,599
I would do it. Yeah, that's a good one

557
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:57,380
Smarties guys if you think that smarties is going to pay some random dickhead streamer like me to do anything like you're out

558
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:59,380
Of your out of your mind

559
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:02,710
Skill increases your strength by a hundred percent

560
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:12,829
Got a shop now fence of logs

561
01:01:13,550 --> 01:01:15,719
Or decoration. How about a fence of logs?

562
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:35,369
Should I put this? Okay. I got I got that twine. I can do this. I got a lot of it

563
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:51,099
Like the sounds all the sounds kind of make you remind you like you're collecting gems or something

564
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:55,599
I've got to do it like a bunch in a row

565
01:01:55,840 --> 01:02:00,519
So it's like I walk in and I open up the crate and a bunch of gems fall out and I touch them all

566
01:02:00,519 --> 01:02:02,480
In like one second, right?

567
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,420
That's good. That was good

568
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:11,389
That's good

569
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:15,500
All right time for some walls mix making mud

570
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:20,989
What do I have to do put mud in here and then fill it with water?

571
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:33,289
Pick up a shovel. It's some clay. Okay, put the clay into the basket

572
01:02:34,610 --> 01:02:46,780
Got the wooden bowl scoop some scoop some water into bowl from scream

573
01:02:47,460 --> 01:03:03,039
Or water in the basket. Whoa, I thought that said stuttering help like if the game is having a problem. Whoa, what is that?

574
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,000
fake reactions

575
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,760
Okay, so I can make clay

576
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:13,469
Mud shaper you have a basket full of clay and there's a block from near the stove

577
01:03:13,469 --> 01:03:16,309
Take the clay out of the basket and put it into the form

578
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:33,449
What? Okay, cool. Now what? That's it. How much do I have to do? Oh my god. This is just like tasks the game. All right

579
01:03:34,030 --> 01:03:53,639
There's gotta be a skill point I can do for this. Yeah, it's more mud blocks, please. I was really sus, but you just said

580
01:03:56,159 --> 01:04:08,599
This way got it I went to school for bricking

581
01:04:12,159 --> 01:04:15,929
You did

582
01:04:15,929 --> 01:04:19,849
Did I just read another like like song lyric or something, what are you talking about?

583
01:04:19,849 --> 01:04:32,739
I feel like I'm reading stuff that I don't I have no context of what's going on. Oh, hell. Yeah

584
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:34,760
Yeah

585
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:50,139
This is gonna take forever, but I'm obsessed. I'm studying right now. Can you please shut up for once? Yeah

586
01:04:50,659 --> 01:04:56,519
I'll be quiet. You gotta here's thing though. If you're gonna you're gonna tell me to be quiet on my stream

587
01:04:58,539 --> 01:05:12,380
You better get at least to see on that whatever it is. Oh, I need mud and now I need water

588
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:21,800
So you better get at least I didn't say be quiet. I said to get a see

589
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:44,250
Nice, that's so much better. Yeah mother nature. Yeah

590
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:50,780
HDTV presents the saw stream

591
01:05:57,670 --> 01:06:07,059
You know what's funny though, I mean don't be surprised

592
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:14,400
Not necessarily that exact company, but that's kind of funny to me in its own way

593
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:23,559
How Franksburgers presents the diaper stream?

594
01:06:24,159 --> 01:06:48,809
Like um, you know, you do you know you're signing up for you. That was always the plan cool

595
01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:59,530
That's one wall done. I still have a lot. I gotta do that on all sides. Okay, and I hold the button

596
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:11,920
No, I mean for a cereal box game. This has great sound effects, which makes me want to continue to place the bricks

597
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:16,840
But under and by any means necessary

598
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:27,280
Right

599
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:35,429
Point you will form unimaginable more mud blocks at the same time and allows you to build brick after brick all the time

600
01:07:36,030 --> 01:07:37,389
There it is

601
01:07:37,389 --> 01:07:47,179
You're gonna play the new Goblin game

602
01:07:47,699 --> 01:07:58,139
I don't know that is probably shouldn't be doing it like that. But that's what the tutorial did

603
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:00,820
Let's see what ungodly amounts look like

604
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:19,960
It's not that much. It ain't that much doesn't know you've not played the new goblin game

605
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:24,630
I can easily imagine that many bricks

606
01:08:25,229 --> 01:08:42,649
I know like the fuck false advertising and shit. Are you gonna have?

607
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:53,619
Everyone what the fuck is going on? It's a game where you

608
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:56,539
You build houses. What do you?

609
01:08:57,100 --> 01:09:07,739
What do you want me to tell you all games and all movies and all TV shows?

610
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:10,460
You could just say like what the fuck is going on

611
01:09:13,609 --> 01:09:18,649
Something otherworldly or something that like well, this is not otherworldly but look you could say that about the Muppets

612
01:09:21,239 --> 01:09:27,880
Okay, do you go do you turn the channel and you get on like Muppets take Manhattan and go what the fuck is going on?

613
01:09:28,279 --> 01:09:31,000
With these like little weirdos. Who's that little green guy?

614
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:38,119
It's like a piece of media. You just you're gonna you could you'll figure it out. Somebody will help you you can enjoy it

615
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:44,119
Wait, wait, what the fuck's going on here that bear that bear can talk

616
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:51,279
Why does he sound like Yoda?

617
01:09:51,960 --> 01:10:02,779
To voice Andy. I have a hundred and seventy four of these. Oh

618
01:10:02,859 --> 01:10:17,479
Oh

619
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:31,109
Did not think I was gonna like that as much as I do. Holy shit. That was cool

620
01:10:31,109 --> 01:10:39,560
All right, I gotta know was this you can form more mud blocks than you really need. That's fine. Just get it

621
01:10:40,359 --> 01:10:51,979
Remember, what is your IRL house made out of and I think pretty much the same thing that everybody's IRL house is made out of

622
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:55,439
kitty litter and

623
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:59,250
That's it kitty litter and water

624
01:10:59,689 --> 01:11:10,500
That's cement. All right. That's what it is. I'm like that

625
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:21,739
Wow, okay. Now that is actually a lot

626
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:40,539
That's a pretty decent amount zero. Can I make a ladder? How many clay balls do you think you could fit in a subway sandwich?

627
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:49,779
One I would assume maybe one

628
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:53,329
But that would just be the sandwich

629
01:11:53,369 --> 01:12:06,989
It would just be two pieces of bread and a thing of clay, but you don't eat clay

630
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:12,289
I remember during the Halloween stream when bugleberry was

631
01:12:12,890 --> 01:12:18,300
Eating spiders off of the table, which I'm not sure you could even see on the stream

632
01:12:18,699 --> 01:12:22,260
But there was little spiders that were being pulled with string

633
01:12:22,859 --> 01:12:25,340
Across the table and I was eating them with my hands

634
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:32,409
I mean I was back I was backstage like mimicking bugleberry like oh, that's what I want you to do like directing

635
01:12:33,819 --> 01:12:38,460
But that's what I was supposed to be and I got a lot of comments

636
01:12:38,979 --> 01:12:43,220
Saying bugleberry bugleberry. Don't put clay like that in your mouth. I

637
01:12:45,779 --> 01:12:52,060
Remember I remember like, you know if if that were to be a mask, right which it's not that's somebody's skin

638
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:58,100
But if that was a mask that somebody was wearing which absolutely not the case

639
01:12:58,819 --> 01:13:00,989
But if there was a mask

640
01:13:02,229 --> 01:13:10,029
The clay that caked around their mouth like a little kid eating a chocolate bar that stayed there

641
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:17,510
For the whole BRB

642
01:13:18,069 --> 01:13:19,590
Desperately wipe off

643
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:35,550
You know, it'd be kind of interesting. Don't eat clay by the way, like honestly

644
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:38,989
I think it actually people were saying it's like don't put any it's like actually fucking horrible

645
01:13:38,989 --> 01:13:43,720
I don't remember why but I know it's just like don't fucking do that. Don't put it in your mouth

646
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:55,859
What's the actual like reason why something it's something like that plays just dust

647
01:13:56,380 --> 01:14:04,199
Has a certain disease really? Yeah, I don't fuck around with that shit. Seriously don't

648
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:13,090
Really? I need one more

649
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:23,140
There we can pull that back that's minerals

650
01:14:23,659 --> 01:14:33,500
Play from Minecraft. Yeah, that's where my that's where clay is from

651
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:47,729
Do we have a whole generation of kids that think that clay is from Minecraft? We don't right? What do I need?

652
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:51,149
Shape the tiles in the same way blocks

653
01:14:51,890 --> 01:15:12,779
Using the mold on the other side of the basket where oh here. Okay, that's it

654
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:18,939
Wait shape the tiles in the same way to the blocks

655
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:21,560
But using the mold on the other side of the basket

656
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:27,600
Light up the furnace by putting some wood into the hole at its base. Finally put raw tiles through the chimney. Oh

657
01:15:28,539 --> 01:15:30,220
That's what this is for

658
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:38,159
What would be what would be funnier?

659
01:15:38,319 --> 01:15:43,319
What would even be funnier if is if kids hold on that went too fast

660
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:48,409
If it's the kids thought redstone was from Minecraft

661
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:56,340
You know, what's funny? I'm one of those kids. I thought I thought that that redstone was like a jokey thing that was made

662
01:15:57,020 --> 01:15:59,199
Just made up for the game

663
01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:06,729
It's not it is wait. It is

664
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:10,380
So what are you doing to me? Why are you making me look like an idiot?

665
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:29,979
I put this in put wood, right? How I do this earn on it cries wood to light a fire. So where is it?

666
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:33,869
Just hit right click. What is happening? Is it working? Oh

667
01:16:35,880 --> 01:17:07,560
Where do they come out turn off the furnace? Where are they? I don't where are they skill points? I don't have any skills

668
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:11,250
You have to fill the whole thing up. Oh

669
01:17:12,449 --> 01:17:14,090
Shit, okay. I see

670
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:28,270
Okay, little thing unit lost unit lost

671
01:17:28,989 --> 01:17:32,350
unit lost

672
01:17:32,350 --> 01:17:37,470
Destruction complete. Ooh

673
01:17:38,430 --> 01:17:52,970
Can I reach all the way up there? I'm a girl mustache. I did I looked disgusting and I shaved it and I said never again

674
01:17:53,489 --> 01:18:08,090
I'm just gonna do this for a little while because it's just kind of get that started. Yeah

675
01:18:08,670 --> 01:18:14,670
grow a better mustache I

676
01:18:14,670 --> 01:18:19,909
Can't really grow facial hair. I know that everybody says everybody I know. Yeah. Yeah

677
01:18:20,029 --> 01:18:24,909
Dude, you're not doing it for long enough. You keep getting to like the

678
01:18:25,789 --> 01:18:32,109
You just went through puberty and decided not to shave your face because maybe a you don't know how or

679
01:18:33,109 --> 01:18:38,789
B you think it looks good. I know I'm at that I hit that stage, right and that's all it looks like

680
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:45,649
That's all it looks like for me. It never goes over that stage. I

681
01:18:46,170 --> 01:18:53,939
Will go a month without shaving and it still looks like that. I need more

682
01:18:54,779 --> 01:18:56,779
I need more this

683
01:19:23,949 --> 01:19:47,050
Anybody else relaxed right now like wicked bad. I want some more coffee. Oh, what how much did you take?

684
01:19:48,810 --> 01:20:06,569
We mean how much of what did I take coffee? I said one cup of coffee one. That's it

685
01:20:06,569 --> 01:20:20,329
I saw all right. I want do we get to like the actual homes like houses like with concrete and

686
01:20:21,329 --> 01:20:23,729
Floorboards and shit. I feel like that's gonna happen soon

687
01:20:24,329 --> 01:20:37,239
All right, I can do this. I got 72. That should be enough. Ooh, look at this

688
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:51,939
Why are you changing the subject? What subject were we on? Are we on a subject? I don't remember the subject

689
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:11,300
Read a clock there guys. There are no clocks where I am. It's not it. There's no electricity

690
01:21:11,899 --> 01:21:42,520
So I get up there. I stand on something. I can't stand on this. He's a look up. Oh, I can go inside right right right

691
01:21:43,119 --> 01:21:54,819
Clock debacle. Yeah, I have not really taken any

692
01:21:55,739 --> 01:22:02,170
THC since that I remember okay. I remember very specifically

693
01:22:03,170 --> 01:22:09,039
So when I it's true. Well, actually New Year's Eve last year, right?

694
01:22:11,689 --> 01:22:21,359
So when I did that and I looked back and I watched the clip and I knew how desperate I was to try to just like

695
01:22:21,359 --> 01:22:22,600
Get the right time

696
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:25,479
So this is what I did. I

697
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,520
watched that footage back in my

698
01:22:29,119 --> 01:22:33,239
I did the thing that you go like this, but you just can't believe it and you're so pissed because you look so stupid

699
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:39,770
Did one of these I went like this watching it I went

700
01:22:40,289 --> 01:22:48,350
You know, you would wipe your fucking face because you keep like you just can't believe it

701
01:22:49,010 --> 01:23:00,789
Just sitting there going that's what I was doing and I didn't want to have that reaction again

702
01:23:00,789 --> 01:23:09,439
I was just rubbing my mouth going like God

703
01:23:10,739 --> 01:23:22,640
And because I was looking at the chat and here's the thing everybody in the chat saying this has to be bullshit

704
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:25,260
This has to be made up

705
01:23:25,260 --> 01:23:30,439
Right, like there's no way you are doing this not on purpose, right?

706
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:33,779
It's like fuck. I just look so stupid

707
01:23:34,699 --> 01:23:40,239
but then I also had this same kind of

708
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:45,619
Epiphany a little bit here. I thought about this the other day. This is really interesting topic. I

709
01:23:47,189 --> 01:23:53,270
Haven't been now this again. You're gonna say what does this have to do with reading a clock? That's like basic human knowledge

710
01:23:53,270 --> 01:23:54,680
I

711
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:57,039
haven't been in a classroom

712
01:23:57,680 --> 01:24:00,050
In almost 20 years

713
01:24:00,729 --> 01:24:02,460
And I think about that a lot

714
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:07,300
I remember being in class and like the memory is so fleeting to me

715
01:24:07,859 --> 01:24:10,840
it's such a distant memory of

716
01:24:12,439 --> 01:24:14,439
doing essays and

717
01:24:15,319 --> 01:24:17,319
problems and tests and

718
01:24:18,670 --> 01:24:23,189
It's I it's a it's a fleeting memory and that's weird to think about

719
01:24:23,869 --> 01:24:28,069
Because I remember like being up all night like fuck. I got a cram for this test

720
01:24:28,670 --> 01:24:43,369
That's so long ago. What am I doing? It's a it's kind of a foreign concept, right?

721
01:24:44,010 --> 01:24:47,770
What the fuck just happened? What are these done?

722
01:24:48,409 --> 01:25:01,199
He's got he's actually finished. Um, I don't I don't think he's done. They are done. What have I been doing?

723
01:25:01,859 --> 01:25:23,210
Muscle man. I mean, let's just get this one. Oh, I can jump but memory is a weird thing because that those memories from like

724
01:25:23,609 --> 01:25:30,069
15 20 plus years ago. They're like they're like stopping existing

725
01:25:30,630 --> 01:25:32,579
They're being

726
01:25:32,579 --> 01:25:37,350
Like my hard drive is writing over that information in a way

727
01:25:37,829 --> 01:25:44,289
Which is really bizarre to think about trust me when I tell you as somebody that's turning 37 this year

728
01:25:45,130 --> 01:25:50,659
Once your hard drive starts to write over information from 20 years ago is when you're gonna start to look around and be like what?

729
01:25:51,180 --> 01:26:12,229
Wow, I do this with this. He's right. Yeah

730
01:26:12,229 --> 01:26:17,109
No, it's a weird feeling because I didn't have this feeling back in my let's say mid 20s, right?

731
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:27,359
In my mid to late 20s, it was kind of that was still not necessarily fresh in my mind, but it was still close

732
01:26:28,119 --> 01:26:33,640
I'm approaching that period where being in school is a distant memory

733
01:26:34,319 --> 01:26:49,689
Most on there. How many childhood memories do you think your brain deleted to replace with shitty internet memes?

734
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:57,460
You know, that's like kind of unfortunate if you really think about it, that's really kind of unfortunate

735
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:28,279
Okay, now I get it now I understand what you're talking about somebody is firing a gun at me I want to get a look at

736
01:27:28,279 --> 01:27:33,449
It. Oh

737
01:27:33,449 --> 01:27:44,939
Trapper house anymore. Ooh a half timbered house. Ooh

738
01:27:45,140 --> 01:28:03,970
Any others that's the trapper house. I'm gonna do the half timber house watch movie

739
01:28:04,409 --> 01:28:24,529
What wait, what do you mean watch movie? What I now watch the movie?

740
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:28,500
Okay, let's watch the movie

741
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:39,300
What is this a movie of

742
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:48,109
Wait, I don't watch somebody else's stream

743
01:28:48,789 --> 01:28:54,310
Hey, by the way, you gotta up your bitrate man

744
01:28:54,869 --> 01:28:57,109
You scream it up like fucking 500k

745
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:36,670
Trailer it's not out. I think this is early access or something. We just spoiling the whole thing. I don't want to see the whole thing

746
01:29:37,470 --> 01:29:49,520
Showing me the whole house. I want to see the whole house

747
01:29:50,079 --> 01:30:27,539
All you down I got a can all right. I need to know we just saw the whole thing get built

748
01:30:27,939 --> 01:30:39,439
Okay. Well, that's not available

749
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:50,220
The other one is all right. Let's go to that one. This one's available sell

750
01:30:50,659 --> 01:30:57,500
Wait, I bought it now. I sell it. Oh, I was gonna say what sledgehammer

751
01:30:58,140 --> 01:31:07,100
Okay, unfortunately, you're on your own this time. There are no shops or any civilization here

752
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:09,460
You managed to bring the tools on a pickup truck

753
01:31:09,939 --> 01:31:13,409
But you have to arrange the rest of the things you need for the construction of this house yourself

754
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:17,670
Hey Karen watch out for the bears. Good luck. Stop saying that there's no animals in this game

755
01:31:18,470 --> 01:31:24,470
Stopper building a trappers house from the foundations. I thought they weren't gonna help me

756
01:31:25,069 --> 01:31:28,479
Yeah, okay. That's like if dark souls

757
01:31:29,239 --> 01:31:31,239
Would it be like

758
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:38,960
Here we are fire link shrine you're on your own motherfucker. Good luck. It's dark souls. It's hard as shit

759
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:44,520
And we don't help you and then I walk up to the first enemy and I take a swing and the game

760
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:54,640
pauses and this three one two three on the screen images with different paragraphs under each image

761
01:31:56,069 --> 01:32:01,149
Explaining how to swing the weapon. That's what they're doing here. I leave me alone

762
01:32:01,829 --> 01:32:08,619
Which look I gotta be honest. I said this the other day. I said if I'm not playing the VR stuff, too

763
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:12,489
like the video game tutorial

764
01:32:12,810 --> 01:32:19,430
Just tell me how to just do I do you do I really need to be told how to swing the weapon?

765
01:32:19,829 --> 01:32:24,439
It's left click in every single video game

766
01:32:25,180 --> 01:32:31,020
Like can you just give me like a cheat sheet with all the buttons on it?

767
01:32:31,020 --> 01:32:36,710
I don't know why we still have to go and remember right click is aim

768
01:32:37,270 --> 01:32:46,649
You don't have to tell me that like just show it to me. What is the first game ever? It's not it's

769
01:32:47,369 --> 01:32:52,529
This should be we need to have like a I don't know. Why would that be your first game ever? It's not

770
01:32:53,250 --> 01:33:11,449
Left click is a do thing every game. All right. Let me see what this says. There should be a tutorial game

771
01:33:11,729 --> 01:33:15,609
Yeah, there should be like steam should come up with an app that you can download

772
01:33:15,609 --> 01:33:22,890
That's just like getting started with gaming and you put just have every game follow the same fucking basic rules

773
01:33:22,890 --> 01:33:25,170
And you can open up this like steam

774
01:33:25,729 --> 01:33:27,289
how to

775
01:33:27,289 --> 01:33:32,260
remember most games have left click as their means of

776
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:35,140
attacking and or shooting and

777
01:33:36,199 --> 01:33:39,960
Then the game can come up. It could be like here we go. Here's the tutorial. Here we go

778
01:33:40,479 --> 01:33:46,920
Instead of spending like six plus hours tutorialing me just please refer to the steam workshop app

779
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:50,359
tutorial if you don't know how to use a computer and

780
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:56,539
Then we can shave the first six fucking hours of just stretching to add

781
01:33:56,779 --> 01:34:01,100
Cutscenes to tutorials to make it worth showing so the developers don't feel like

782
01:34:01,659 --> 01:34:04,420
We're gonna have we have to spend two hours telling people how to play the game

783
01:34:04,979 --> 01:34:09,380
We have to make up like a fucking story that they can play through in the tutorial. They don't have to do that anymore

784
01:34:09,979 --> 01:34:19,859
Just get to the good stuff get to the meat. Can we watch the new five nights at Freddy's video?

785
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:24,779
No, we're not watching five nights at Freddy's you're watching Jerma

786
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:29,260
This place sucks. So you picked a good one

787
01:34:29,779 --> 01:34:36,079
Alright, we'll start building a Trappers house from the foundations. These are logs that are well embedded in the soil, right?

788
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:39,729
You can get the logs by cutting these trees. Oh

789
01:34:41,090 --> 01:34:43,420
It's a deer

790
01:34:43,420 --> 01:34:59,949
You move fast. There's pigs. Wait. Why did you develop pigs? Why have pigs and like animals?

791
01:35:00,470 --> 01:35:16,250
Okay, let's go back to what I was saying. Oh shit, it's just like minecraft. I don't know where my house is. There it is

792
01:35:16,710 --> 01:35:18,800
Can I get in the car?

793
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:24,560
Please tell me I can drive the truck. Can I please it's okay

794
01:35:25,079 --> 01:35:30,119
All right. What the fuck am I doing? I need to read this

795
01:35:32,260 --> 01:35:38,840
Please refer to the steam tutorial app gaming for beginners. I would probably flip out right now

796
01:35:39,479 --> 01:35:42,239
Yeah, imagine if that's what it told me

797
01:35:45,260 --> 01:35:46,819
Suck so much

798
01:35:46,819 --> 01:35:53,069
Okay, you can get the logs by cutting trees nearby. Remember that you have to cut logs by chainsaw

799
01:35:53,710 --> 01:36:00,390
Okay, yes to blueprint size and of course debark each log with draw shave

800
01:36:01,229 --> 01:36:11,489
Good, I'm gonna cut down logs

801
01:36:12,170 --> 01:36:24,079
these down

802
01:36:24,079 --> 01:36:25,840
script scree

803
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:28,520
Scree, what is that to change just a scroll scroll?

804
01:36:31,140 --> 01:36:35,699
I thought it was spacebar. No, I thought it was spray spray

805
01:36:36,260 --> 01:36:37,539
scrape bar

806
01:36:37,539 --> 01:36:45,010
Am I doing this wrong? Oh

807
01:36:45,329 --> 01:36:53,449
What do I do? He's a one point one five in length

808
01:36:54,579 --> 01:37:18,720
What that's way bigger than that and that's huge. What is going on? Oh

809
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:25,199
Thank you. Thank you so much. Here it is

810
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:36,880
This is it right here. I'll need a chainsaw. Here it is. All right, here's my best chainsaw impression

811
01:37:41,359 --> 01:37:43,359
I

812
01:37:50,850 --> 01:38:14,289
Just picked up the whole tree. Oh fuck. Now what do I do? I'm a forester and I'm impressed. Hey, thanks

813
01:38:14,289 --> 01:38:22,800
Oh shit. Okay, this may

814
01:38:23,199 --> 01:38:33,399
Know that's too big. These look like it looks like dog sausages

815
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:39,210
No, if you guys have ever had combos, okay, it needs to be that tall

816
01:38:39,729 --> 01:38:46,899
How tall is this?

817
01:38:46,899 --> 01:39:10,859
1.5. That's not even right. Why is it doing this? It's like 0.65. Okay right there. All right, got it

818
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:37,979
That right. What am I supposed to do with this shit? Oh, I have to debark it. How do I do that?

819
01:39:38,180 --> 01:40:16,170
How do I debark it like that? Oh, I actually have to move my hand. I was gonna say what's going on

820
01:40:16,449 --> 01:40:21,109
All right. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it

821
01:40:21,630 --> 01:40:42,920
He's learning you said everything is left-click. No, okay. There's a difference between adding a game mechanic later

822
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:44,920
right

823
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:47,600
But even adding the game mechanics

824
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:54,920
We spend so much time telling you how to play rather than letting you play Dark Souls greatest game franchise of all time

825
01:40:55,279 --> 01:41:15,569
It's already done. It's too big. No, these are perfect. No tutorial Andy. That one was not even the right size

826
01:41:16,130 --> 01:41:18,439
Guys actually doesn't even matter

827
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:41,600
No, it doesn't a couple more of these logs

828
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:48,909
Yeah, that's five says it's a whatever guy. That's not that tall says size doesn't matter

829
01:41:49,670 --> 01:42:01,199
You're wicked funny. You're wicked funny. You're gonna ever do the wink redemption thing again

830
01:42:01,720 --> 01:42:06,840
Let me ask you a question. So back when I had the wink redemption channel points

831
01:42:07,319 --> 01:42:11,930
There were probably three thousand concurrent four thousand concurrent people here like a year or two ago

832
01:42:12,529 --> 01:42:17,279
There are almost 19,000 people watching the stream

833
01:42:18,359 --> 01:42:20,359
Turning winks back on would

834
01:42:20,479 --> 01:42:27,140
That would be the broadcast would be over. It would be only wink redemptions the entire stream. It would never

835
01:42:27,659 --> 01:42:35,380
Be anything else ever because it already was all I was doing back when I had a third of the audience

836
01:42:36,020 --> 01:42:51,720
There would be unbearable. That was a flex. It's not a flex. I'm just whatever just make them really expensive

837
01:42:52,319 --> 01:43:03,710
Do one please fine. Okay. I will do one wink into the I will wink into the camera

838
01:43:04,090 --> 01:43:07,569
If you guys without any like mod help

839
01:43:08,149 --> 01:43:14,319
Right now like oh we can clear the chat. I don't want to see a chat message of

840
01:43:15,319 --> 01:43:21,020
Ten whole seconds. I want the chat to stop and I don't want it to move. I

841
01:43:21,699 --> 01:43:25,399
Want no one to write anything for a full ten seconds and I'll do it

842
01:43:30,439 --> 01:43:39,949
No, not dot dot dots just nothing in the chat it's just frozen and that's not moving

843
01:43:40,390 --> 01:43:51,460
This game has animals that are more detailed than Red Dead Redemption 2

844
01:43:52,060 --> 01:44:11,289
That's actually a really well-made elk. There's a Fox to shut up. Yeah, I see how easy it is to get you to keep talking

845
01:44:11,949 --> 01:44:26,180
Wait, it's doing it for me. I fucked that up. So bad. The game was like, you know what don't worry about it

846
01:44:26,180 --> 01:44:31,619
I'm gonna do it for you

847
01:44:32,260 --> 01:44:36,060
Scared me. All right, use a chainsaw. Uh-huh

848
01:44:36,659 --> 01:44:44,569
All right. We're not playing that game anymore. You also prepare the next logs in the same way

849
01:44:44,569 --> 01:44:48,890
You're cutting another tree you bark them from the bark with a special tool and then you cover the chainsaw

850
01:44:49,449 --> 01:44:58,010
Okay, this is cool. Do I need this?

851
01:44:58,609 --> 01:45:04,600
We have to debark this you bark it

852
01:45:05,199 --> 01:45:16,199
Well, that's way better than what I was doing. I did that in the probably dumbest possible way, but guys size doesn't even matter

853
01:45:16,199 --> 01:45:24,789
What?

854
01:45:24,789 --> 01:45:43,930
Alright now I'm making it bread. I can make wood salami

855
01:45:45,250 --> 01:46:04,600
Make it thinner. Can you make it thinner, please? I love

856
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:07,119
In slices of deli meat

857
01:46:08,079 --> 01:46:14,279
Let's be honest when the person behind the counter holds it up and goes, is this all right?

858
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:20,420
You just say yes, you know what I mean? Like what does it really matter that much?

859
01:46:21,300 --> 01:46:31,390
Like honestly if you for a lot of the people that go to the deli and they go

860
01:46:31,390 --> 01:46:36,689
Um, can you make it super super thin for me and they do it and they show it up and they go

861
01:46:36,689 --> 01:46:39,890
Mmm, I think a little bit thinner than that, please and they go. Okay

862
01:46:40,369 --> 01:46:44,770
They could probably just put the same piece of salami up and they would think it was fine

863
01:46:45,569 --> 01:47:01,310
Like oh, yeah. Yeah, I'll do it. How's this? Oh, that's much better. All right. What am I stop doing this?

864
01:47:01,310 --> 01:47:03,550
I need to like actually cut this correctly. How far is this?

865
01:47:04,109 --> 01:47:09,800
two point two point nine meters

866
01:47:10,319 --> 01:47:13,720
Alright, I gotta get this is all trash now. I gotta get rid of this

867
01:47:14,199 --> 01:47:19,819
Like when the person at the deli counter just kind of goes, hey, is that alright? I

868
01:47:20,380 --> 01:47:25,979
Mean if it's way too thick you just be like, oh, can you like a little bit thinner like I or before they even start

869
01:47:25,979 --> 01:47:27,819
Cutting it you go. Can you make it thin?

870
01:47:27,819 --> 01:47:55,390
That's it face came on. We've been good. Mm-hmm. It's my house. Oh, there it is. Okay. Oh

871
01:47:58,359 --> 01:48:10,119
Cute Fox is getting nighttime. Alright, stop. I need to cut trees down

872
01:48:13,250 --> 01:48:19,270
Now I need two point eight meters

873
01:48:19,829 --> 01:48:29,220
Starting here. How many can I get out of this this two point nine right there? I can get probably three

874
01:48:29,979 --> 01:48:32,220
All right, two point nine got it

875
01:48:32,500 --> 01:48:36,000
It's gonna take forever. I'm not giving up

876
01:48:40,439 --> 01:48:53,220
That close enough for this two point nine. I can do it twice two point nine. There it is

877
01:48:55,770 --> 01:49:11,500
So it's three equal pieces, I don't need to measure anymore just do three equal pieces

878
01:49:11,939 --> 01:49:25,180
Hey, pick it up. What? Oh god. Damn it. It's that that didn't okay

879
01:49:25,859 --> 01:49:40,689
Then that's outer edge. Well, that's a whole tree. That's the whole thing. All right, cut another one down. I got it now

880
01:49:41,409 --> 01:49:43,010
Oh

881
01:49:43,010 --> 01:49:50,039
Three equal parts. Wait

882
01:49:51,239 --> 01:49:55,050
Skin this thing. That's way better. Okay, so much faster

883
01:49:55,810 --> 01:49:57,520
one

884
01:49:57,520 --> 01:49:59,520
two three

885
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:28,579
That's enough. I wasn't even the right piece. It's actually too short

886
01:50:40,609 --> 01:50:43,050
2.9. All right, fine. Let me just do this

887
01:50:43,810 --> 01:50:54,390
Okay, just scaled all this

888
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:17,079
2.9

889
01:51:17,079 --> 01:51:20,470
Thank God a skill

890
01:51:21,720 --> 01:51:23,520
automatic log measurement

891
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:27,539
Thank goodness. Oh

892
01:51:27,539 --> 01:51:28,939
Thank God

893
01:51:28,939 --> 01:51:30,939
What a disaster this would have been

894
01:51:31,020 --> 01:51:50,489
Perfect. Okay, two point nine nice log, bro. I you know, I hate that people are called shit a log

895
01:51:51,090 --> 01:51:56,279
That's I hate it. It just seems so

896
01:51:56,920 --> 01:51:59,880
So dumb and gross. It's just so awful

897
01:52:00,640 --> 01:52:28,109
Alright, the rest of these are big for this one. No. Oh, is this too short? It's not this is big

898
01:52:28,829 --> 01:52:37,520
Too short. It's not too short. I got to measure this again because like what the heck

899
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:46,829
4.7 easy or

900
01:52:49,069 --> 01:52:53,449
7

901
01:52:53,449 --> 01:53:07,390
There it is. We're seven

902
01:53:07,989 --> 01:53:24,689
Okay, this one should fit too. What's that song from a Red Dead? Oh

903
01:53:25,289 --> 01:53:28,569
We're having a little fun. They will have a little how we're building

904
01:53:29,289 --> 01:53:37,569
Build all things and we have a little happen. Whatever it is. I love that song

905
01:53:38,010 --> 01:53:53,180
Keep picking up the same piece of wood. In fact, just start over. Give me another one

906
01:53:55,590 --> 01:53:59,289
Need

907
01:53:59,289 --> 01:54:14,449
Two that are how long stop stop stop

908
01:54:14,970 --> 01:54:19,279
Or for whatever for or something

909
01:54:28,050 --> 01:54:35,270
That should do it. Oh

910
01:54:35,470 --> 01:54:37,739
you

911
01:54:37,739 --> 01:54:57,170
When are you going to ancient Egypt? I don't know

912
01:54:57,689 --> 01:55:03,409
You also prefer the next logs in the same way. You're cutting another tree you debark them more of this

913
01:55:04,250 --> 01:55:08,920
Automatic laser measurement. Ooh

914
01:55:10,909 --> 01:55:17,289
How long is this? These are all art. Thank you five

915
01:55:18,930 --> 01:55:23,300
All right, four point six four point six four point six four point six

916
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:33,859
I need for this will fit here one of these will already got all this scrap. I will use it

917
01:55:34,420 --> 01:55:49,789
Thank you. Thanks for the help. Thanks Luigi. Okay. Now this is all right four point six four point six four point six

918
01:55:50,310 --> 01:55:59,020
Is a bear staring at me?

919
01:56:04,399 --> 01:56:15,770
That's a cat or there's just pigs

920
01:56:16,409 --> 01:56:35,479
There's no bear. No, that's a pig guys. This is like a warthog

921
01:56:39,779 --> 01:56:45,779
Can't do it

922
01:56:45,819 --> 01:56:54,020
Shaving them automatically. Oh

923
01:57:01,689 --> 01:57:14,340
You can fuck up by 30% perfect. Yep. We're good. Oh hell. Yeah, he doesn't even matter Luigi's gonna help me

924
01:57:21,539 --> 01:57:41,140
That's so incorrect. You sure? All right, what about over here? If it's too long, they just end up cutting it and helping you

925
01:57:41,140 --> 01:58:03,489
So it's fine. Watch out. There's a hair. There's a herobrine. Oh, no one more

926
01:58:11,430 --> 01:58:13,229
Herobrine

927
01:58:13,229 --> 01:58:21,539
What does herobrine even do he doesn't need to stare at you with red eyes or something and he's like kills you

928
01:58:21,939 --> 01:58:25,899
He's a huge. Okay more of this

929
01:58:28,039 --> 01:58:37,390
I did not put that there. It's weird

930
01:58:46,210 --> 01:59:06,750
There's not a bear

931
01:59:06,750 --> 01:59:20,579
I'm actually glad there's doing this because I can just put these two here. Be sure not this one

932
01:59:21,140 --> 01:59:25,560
All right, one more and I'm gonna have to start making actual planks

933
01:59:36,390 --> 01:59:41,949
There's even more that does sound like you'll like a lot

934
01:59:42,489 --> 01:59:55,210
Okay, I gotta put some more logs down here. I think it's honestly I think it's time to do this

935
01:59:55,210 --> 01:59:58,609
I have to cut down just like ten trees and stack them over here

936
02:00:00,329 --> 02:00:05,539
You can play cruelty squad, I don't know I don't have like a plan to but

937
02:00:06,180 --> 02:00:15,399
I

938
02:00:16,399 --> 02:00:25,590
Appreciate the sport. Thank you. So also keep in mind. We also have AI dungeon

939
02:00:26,149 --> 02:00:32,989
And that I'm gonna be playing probably soon here. I have novel AI and AI dungeon both ready to go

940
02:00:33,750 --> 02:00:41,619
Like I said before I kind of like this

941
02:00:41,779 --> 02:00:45,020
Play something for a few hours move to something else for like an hour or two play something for an hour

942
02:00:45,020 --> 02:00:52,319
I kind of kind of like it now, obviously some games would not you can't do that. I kind of like this. It's fun

943
02:00:52,359 --> 02:01:11,739
It's fun to jump around I'm gonna say two more. I still need another coffee. Well, the squad has stocks

944
02:01:12,659 --> 02:01:13,939
Really?

945
02:01:13,939 --> 02:01:37,229
You mean I could trade I think that's good be three more too short. Oh my goodness

946
02:01:37,789 --> 02:01:56,329
This is next level. All right, still need the big ones. Yep. That's too short. There we go

947
02:01:56,750 --> 02:02:03,789
How many can I carry I can carry this many? I didn't know that

948
02:02:04,470 --> 02:02:07,220
Graphics are all that matter in video games

949
02:02:07,539 --> 02:02:10,300
Um, not really I

950
02:02:11,060 --> 02:02:17,010
Would disagree with you on that and the most fun I've ever had was a game

951
02:02:17,689 --> 02:02:21,850
That looked like it was from like 2004 like 2006

952
02:02:22,489 --> 02:02:27,949
Some games are like 2d pixel graphics and I found them amazing

953
02:02:28,789 --> 02:02:33,460
Companies care way too much about graphics

954
02:02:33,939 --> 02:02:39,020
Way too much if the driving factor for the huge amount of things that you play

955
02:02:39,859 --> 02:02:51,640
About Mario Superstar Baseball

956
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:56,600
Mario strikers is I'm looking forward to that that game was amazing

957
02:02:57,279 --> 02:03:09,819
Especially that what they had a sequel, right? It was really good. What are some of the things I'm looking forward to?

958
02:03:11,250 --> 02:03:13,010
Elden Ring, obviously

959
02:03:13,010 --> 02:03:33,579
When does Elden Ring come out? When is the actual launch on Steam? Yeah, but what time who knows?

960
02:03:33,579 --> 02:03:37,699
I wonder if it's gonna be like 1 p.m. Or something or it's opening at midnight

961
02:03:37,699 --> 02:03:39,420
The day before

962
02:03:39,420 --> 02:04:02,010
Supposed to be on the 24th. I'll be Thursday at 9. I'm definitely I'm not doing a midnight launch release thingy

963
02:04:02,010 --> 02:04:20,859
You know, I got these really good sections here. It's a fair type of craft beer. I don't really drink craft beer

964
02:04:20,859 --> 02:04:23,229
I don't drink really beer at all

965
02:04:23,789 --> 02:04:30,060
Every time I drink beer. I take two or three sips out of it when it's really cold

966
02:04:30,699 --> 02:04:32,899
And I go. Oh

967
02:04:32,899 --> 02:04:38,859
Mmm. Oh, that's good. Oh man guys. Oh mine's good. What'd you get? Oh, mine's the mine's the

968
02:04:38,899 --> 02:04:42,579
Orange peel the orange peel. What's it? I I don't have any fucking idea. Just picked one. Oh

969
02:04:43,260 --> 02:04:45,340
It's the orange peel IPA from

970
02:04:45,819 --> 02:04:51,819
From Germany. Yeah, and then it gets kind of a little warmer and I I don't like to drink it

971
02:04:51,819 --> 02:04:57,260
But I have to because it's like you don't you can't like order a full beer in like the nice glass

972
02:04:57,779 --> 02:05:02,380
Take two sips of it and just stare at it. Like I don't yeah, you have to get at least halfway done

973
02:05:03,100 --> 02:05:07,060
right, so

974
02:05:07,619 --> 02:05:10,300
Also, well, I don't know why everyone's so weird. Why are we so weird?

975
02:05:11,060 --> 02:05:13,869
Humans are a weird group of animals

976
02:05:16,420 --> 02:05:21,619
I know we like want other people to enjoy the things we enjoy

977
02:05:22,460 --> 02:05:27,989
But but do we really have to say that they that you think the ketchup is house made?

978
02:05:28,590 --> 02:05:29,670
right

979
02:05:29,670 --> 02:05:31,970
Like hmm. Oh, dude. No, this ketchup's house made

980
02:05:32,529 --> 02:05:34,949
It's no stop. It never is

981
02:05:35,869 --> 02:05:45,510
Ever probably maybe in a few places like dude that honey mustard. Oh, man. Oh

982
02:05:46,390 --> 02:05:49,390
Yep, oh man, that's it. That's it. They made they make that here. They make that in house

983
02:05:49,390 --> 02:05:55,850
I wonder how many times like a restaurateur has heard that come from somebody and they just open up the fridge

984
02:05:56,010 --> 02:05:58,569
There's just bottles of like Heinz ketchup in there

985
02:05:59,130 --> 02:06:14,920
Yeah, it sure is. I've never heard that. What are you talking about? Everybody says that like oh this beer. Oh, mm-hmm

986
02:06:14,920 --> 02:06:16,920
I this is so good

987
02:06:17,800 --> 02:06:21,079
Do you see where it's from? It's from this from Italy

988
02:06:21,659 --> 02:06:25,699
Yeah, it is

989
02:06:32,270 --> 02:06:34,420
Italian beer

990
02:06:34,420 --> 02:06:39,100
Ranch restaurant ranch. Oh my god. It's so good. Oh, by the way ranch Andy's in chat

991
02:06:39,100 --> 02:06:41,979
I got a bone to pick with you. I got a bone to pick with you guys

992
02:06:42,779 --> 02:06:48,939
So a few days ago on this stream. We talked about how oh mayonnaise. Eww yuck mayo

993
02:06:49,500 --> 02:06:52,180
all you ranch enjoyers I

994
02:06:53,140 --> 02:06:55,140
think need to take a step back and

995
02:06:55,579 --> 02:06:57,659
Evaluate how you feel about mayonnaise

996
02:06:58,500 --> 02:07:04,399
Because if I if you think that mayonnaise is gross you better think that ranch is gross, too

997
02:07:05,199 --> 02:07:09,979
Because that shit is like kind of disgusting if you think about it. Just like if you think about mayonnaise

998
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:18,239
unseasoned ranch

999
02:07:18,239 --> 02:07:26,329
Uh-huh

1000
02:07:26,329 --> 02:07:32,170
Unseasoned ranch that's so funny. Excuse me, sir. Would you like some unseasoned ranch, please or fucking mayonnaise?

1001
02:07:32,890 --> 02:07:47,159
Don't care omega. Well don't care

1002
02:07:47,600 --> 02:07:53,220
Ranch actually tastes good. No ranch tastes like ranch

1003
02:07:53,859 --> 02:07:57,279
Mayo makes everything else taste better

1004
02:07:57,979 --> 02:08:05,869
Mayo brings out flavors ranch is ranch

1005
02:08:06,630 --> 02:08:15,880
Not that I'm saying I don't just I dislike ranch, but I mean I can't say I'm like I love it

1006
02:08:16,880 --> 02:08:23,470
I'm actually one of those

1007
02:08:23,789 --> 02:08:28,550
Giga Chad blue cheese enjoyers instead of ranch. I choose blue cheese every time

1008
02:08:29,109 --> 02:08:40,569
If there's a choice between blue cheese or ranch for like a dipping sauce for something I'm gonna choose blue cheese

1009
02:08:40,569 --> 02:08:46,260
I don't know that's kind of I can understand why people think blue cheese is gross, but it doesn't matter

1010
02:08:46,899 --> 02:08:48,899
To me. I just I know

1011
02:08:49,140 --> 02:08:51,140
Don't stop saying giga Chad

1012
02:08:51,779 --> 02:08:58,199
You guys say it all the time. You don't think I'm gonna like at least absorb some of that. Of course I am

1013
02:09:00,420 --> 02:09:07,670
Aoli, yeah, isn't that taste so good that mayonnaise that has like other shit in it like this like a it's like they

1014
02:09:08,050 --> 02:09:14,560
They ground up some garlic and put it in mayonnaise and you love it now. That's garlic mayonnaise

1015
02:09:14,739 --> 02:09:21,819
And holy smokes is that good? Oh

1016
02:09:23,850 --> 02:09:28,819
Eat I could eat garlic mayo out of the jar. I probably could

1017
02:09:29,340 --> 02:09:35,270
Like oh, just put it on bread. I think blue cheese is better than ranch

1018
02:09:35,789 --> 02:09:38,029
There's stuff that I would put ranch on instead of blue cheese

1019
02:09:38,510 --> 02:09:46,100
Should I like do an eating stream where I like eat stuff and write it for you?

1020
02:09:46,619 --> 02:09:55,210
I've seen people do this before you want my real dog shit takes on everything

1021
02:09:55,210 --> 02:10:10,060
Oh, what's like a one that you'd want to see your TV dinners?

1022
02:10:10,579 --> 02:10:27,670
Hmm you want to do a TV dinner stream get a bunch of them you dog sausages dog treats

1023
02:10:28,630 --> 02:10:41,649
That's so stupid dog treat tier list live so many people do like the

1024
02:10:42,210 --> 02:10:44,850
taste test stuff imagine if I had like

1025
02:10:45,489 --> 02:10:47,489
milk bones and

1026
02:10:47,649 --> 02:10:50,010
like dog sausages and like

1027
02:10:50,569 --> 02:10:53,010
Canned dog food and shit and I sat there and I did that

1028
02:10:53,569 --> 02:11:00,699
With special guess at all. I don't have to give his tier list

1029
02:11:01,279 --> 02:11:05,239
And how we do that is I take a few dog treats. I break them up

1030
02:11:05,239 --> 02:11:10,239
So they're really small right so he doesn't get like too much so break them up to the little small taste pieces

1031
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:15,399
Put them out in a row far enough away from each other said so he has to decide I

1032
02:11:17,470 --> 02:11:21,430
Hold him back as like the other end of the room and go okay

1033
02:11:21,430 --> 02:11:27,819
Go watch out and see what he goes for first that is now elevated on the tier list, right?

1034
02:11:28,180 --> 02:11:33,600
So then that's like up at like s tier we put that next to another one, right?

1035
02:11:34,119 --> 02:11:38,159
That he also likes and we make a dog treat tier list

1036
02:11:38,720 --> 02:11:44,810
One thing I'd want to make sure of though is that whatever it was

1037
02:11:45,430 --> 02:11:47,819
It was gonna be

1038
02:11:47,819 --> 02:11:55,449
Very very small amounts like tiny little little pieces because I don't want to sit there and just like feed him bags of treats

1039
02:11:56,170 --> 02:12:04,260
He's saying this, but he's never gonna do it. No. Don't you understand?

1040
02:12:05,079 --> 02:12:09,699
Always remember the things I say because two years from now. I'm gonna spend

1041
02:12:10,600 --> 02:12:12,600
$40,000 on this as a project

1042
02:12:13,210 --> 02:12:16,069
You know what I mean? Like just wait a year or two. There'll be like a

1043
02:12:16,770 --> 02:12:18,949
$70,000 stream where this happens

1044
02:12:21,579 --> 02:12:23,579
Just wait a few years

1045
02:12:29,649 --> 02:12:36,300
That would be actually kind of fun as long as that was done right and it wasn't I wasn't overfeeding him and overdoing it

1046
02:12:36,300 --> 02:12:37,739
I think that'd be funny

1047
02:12:37,739 --> 02:12:48,109
Make a dog treat tier list. No, but the thing is I wouldn't just do the dogs like food tier list

1048
02:12:48,569 --> 02:12:52,090
Like in the middle of that stream

1049
02:12:52,449 --> 02:12:57,090
Macho man Randy Savage has to show up and like eat out of the can with his hands

1050
02:12:57,369 --> 02:13:02,930
And go like whoo. Yeah, and then leave and like I just have to blow money on that stream, right?

1051
02:13:02,930 --> 02:13:04,930
Like I have somebody has to come in and do something weird

1052
02:13:05,449 --> 02:13:12,939
Well, like I have to like be like come here I talk and I have to like fall out of my window

1053
02:13:13,380 --> 02:13:31,220
Like it can't just be a stream where we just do something like basic like that. I'll think about it. I'll think about it

1054
02:13:31,220 --> 02:13:32,579
That's not kind of like a fun idea

1055
02:13:32,579 --> 02:13:35,970
Then we'll find out once and for all

1056
02:13:36,470 --> 02:13:47,729
No, I know not my I'm not saying macho man

1057
02:13:47,729 --> 02:13:51,729
I'm saying like a like celebrity or like a somebody or a thing needs to happen

1058
02:13:51,890 --> 02:14:15,069
That's not just Otto eating dog treats this is coming along Otto is a celebrity, you know, that's true

1059
02:14:32,159 --> 02:14:38,560
I have to start to get it. I gotta use the ladder

1060
02:14:38,800 --> 02:14:48,689
But okay for me, what would you guys want to see me eat? I would do one of these

1061
02:14:49,130 --> 02:15:04,630
There's an endless amount of content here. It's a mess in here roots. Okay, I'm not gonna eat dog food. No

1062
02:15:05,310 --> 02:15:27,100
Okay, you okay. I see a few decent ones. I see a few good ones

1063
02:15:38,149 --> 02:15:42,899
Is this long enough? I need a full tree for that one

1064
02:15:43,600 --> 02:15:51,869
There we go. Good dipping sauce tier list

1065
02:15:51,869 --> 02:15:58,159
I mean I'll do I'll start with one if you guys like it and I maybe I'll do another one

1066
02:15:58,640 --> 02:16:07,710
Canned soups. That's not that's actually a really good one because that's really easy to make

1067
02:16:08,270 --> 02:16:14,819
That's legitimately just heating up soup. So I don't have to do a bunch of bullshit where

1068
02:16:15,460 --> 02:16:23,720
I'm actually kind of into that one. You're gonna have too much sodium

1069
02:16:24,279 --> 02:16:32,459
Well, no, I'm not gonna eat like 40 cans of soup. I'm gonna portion it out

1070
02:16:32,459 --> 02:16:34,459
So it's little taste test versions

1071
02:16:34,620 --> 02:16:41,079
Cover them up put them in the fridge and then be able to eat them over the course of like a week or like a month

1072
02:16:41,579 --> 02:16:43,819
How long I can keep it in the fridge for?

1073
02:16:45,319 --> 02:16:52,299
As when they do the coca-cola versus Pepsi taste test you don't drain a 2-liter to make that decision

1074
02:16:54,549 --> 02:16:57,829
Contrary to what the commercials of a lot of those products would like you to believe

1075
02:16:58,309 --> 02:17:04,030
How many soda commercials do you see where they just tip the thing up and fucking slam it?

1076
02:17:04,750 --> 02:17:07,120
Every time I see that happen. I go. Ow

1077
02:17:07,879 --> 02:17:09,479
that hurts

1078
02:17:09,479 --> 02:17:22,590
Always like in the middle of a jingle, right? It's like cool refreshing taste and they

1079
02:17:23,590 --> 02:17:25,350
It's like a guy on a beach

1080
02:17:25,350 --> 02:17:28,030
tips it back his head slams back and he is like

1081
02:17:29,030 --> 02:17:52,989
an ocean water tier list like the Atlantic versus the Pacific

1082
02:17:53,549 --> 02:18:01,379
You're gonna go go to like the Red Sea and be on camera. All right, here we are. Let's find out where this fits it. Oh

1083
02:18:05,420 --> 02:18:08,540
This one's kind of this one tastes a little bit different. This one's a little nutty

1084
02:18:09,059 --> 02:18:22,780
Let me tell you that's a way for a youtuber to write off a huge vacation. Okay, so just be aware of that

1085
02:18:22,780 --> 02:18:27,510
Oh where I got how I'm gonna travel the whole world

1086
02:18:28,510 --> 02:18:36,879
To take sips out of different bodies of water, isn't that crazy? I have to go to 30 countries

1087
02:18:39,819 --> 02:18:42,479
It's for the video man

1088
02:18:56,590 --> 02:19:14,219
Deductions oh, yeah, this house just looks like uncooked hot dogs. Oh breadsticks

1089
02:19:15,540 --> 02:19:24,299
This house is making me hungry. It just looks like breadsticks. I want to dump some fucking ranch on these things here. You know, I mean

1090
02:19:24,940 --> 02:19:30,190
What about a cereal tier list?

1091
02:19:30,510 --> 02:19:45,049
Yeah, but I already know where I stand on that. I know it completely where I stand. I already did that

1092
02:19:45,049 --> 02:19:47,049
Yeah, but I mean I didn't eat the cereal on stream

1093
02:19:52,379 --> 02:19:59,079
What about like a Yankee candle tier list or like a bed bath and beyond candle tier list?

1094
02:19:59,079 --> 02:20:01,079
I just sit there and I'm like, oh

1095
02:20:01,399 --> 02:20:11,260
This one's alright

1096
02:20:11,260 --> 02:20:15,940
That would suck you would never get the smell out of that room

1097
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:20,399
Okay

1098
02:20:20,399 --> 02:20:22,559
Crayon you just made me spit on my monitor

1099
02:20:23,239 --> 02:20:26,120
Crayon flavor tier list like I think they're flavors

1100
02:20:26,120 --> 02:20:35,540
I don't think that they're just like fun names for colors and actually talk make them out of something that's edible

1101
02:20:36,100 --> 02:20:40,780
like have a fake box of like 500 crayons made lay them all out and eat them and

1102
02:20:41,299 --> 02:20:44,299
But they're actually made out of like an edible material that I can eat

1103
02:20:44,899 --> 02:20:50,770
That would freak out a ton. A lot of people would be fucking freaked out by that big time. I

1104
02:20:51,370 --> 02:20:55,979
Actually might get like a message from twitch like hey

1105
02:20:56,719 --> 02:20:58,719
What are you doing? Stop doing this?

1106
02:20:58,920 --> 02:21:23,159
He's all too short. Hey, it looks good. How often do you get those messages? Um

1107
02:21:24,319 --> 02:21:33,860
Okay, but this is a cool idea and I don't want to just ruin it and leak it in case I ever do it

1108
02:21:33,860 --> 02:21:41,059
I don't want to like leak it and talk about the whole entire thing because I think it's really funny and

1109
02:21:41,180 --> 02:21:44,840
One day I might actually be able to do it right it's possible

1110
02:21:45,239 --> 02:21:50,079
So I don't want to like leak it what it is and maybe I've talked about a little bit before but I'm

1111
02:21:50,959 --> 02:21:55,829
Just in case that this stream actually happens ever

1112
02:21:56,409 --> 02:22:02,600
I'm gonna hold on to it. But yeah, there was there was there was something that I wanted to do

1113
02:22:03,280 --> 02:22:05,280
but it was just like

1114
02:22:05,639 --> 02:22:07,319
Not a big fan

1115
02:22:07,319 --> 02:22:12,170
But I think we could have done it. I think we might have had to tweak it a little bit

1116
02:22:12,809 --> 02:22:19,750
It's nothing like nothing bad. It's nothing not bad. Nothing like like

1117
02:22:20,629 --> 02:22:23,299
Like violent or off learn. No, nothing like that

1118
02:22:24,260 --> 02:22:32,120
Nothing like like sexual or no, no, no, no. No, it was just something that was not didn't sit completely. Well

1119
02:22:32,879 --> 02:22:48,389
Which I mean for very obvious reasons, right? But they're not obvious to us

1120
02:22:50,719 --> 02:22:53,319
But this is such an I love this idea

1121
02:22:53,319 --> 02:23:00,260
I can't I don't it's nothing bad and there's not like oh my god, you can't do this

1122
02:23:00,260 --> 02:23:05,280
No, it's just we had to be like kind of careful with it because we didn't want to make it seem like it was really happening

1123
02:23:05,760 --> 02:23:07,760
That's what it came down to

1124
02:23:07,840 --> 02:23:23,840
No, no leaks. You already know the baseball stream is coming up in like a couple months. So no no leaks

1125
02:23:24,479 --> 02:23:27,229
I've already leaked way too much of that stream

1126
02:23:29,790 --> 02:23:34,950
Like I was gonna be I'm good. I don't care how what people say about that stream is gonna be one of my favorites ever

1127
02:23:34,950 --> 02:23:41,399
I can't wait to do that stream. You have no idea. It's gonna I can't wait

1128
02:23:41,760 --> 02:23:45,600
Yes for me that that streams for me. Okay. No, it's for you, too

1129
02:23:46,120 --> 02:23:59,280
This is coming along

1130
02:23:59,280 --> 02:24:10,479
No for is no leaks. No person someone in chat said it. Yes

1131
02:24:11,120 --> 02:24:15,760
Someone in chat has talked about it because I I have talked about it before

1132
02:24:16,399 --> 02:24:22,690
Very briefly. I didn't get on going to details of what it meant, but I don't know it was gonna be fine

1133
02:24:24,370 --> 02:24:36,879
But I didn't do that stream not because I didn't have like permission to it was just that

1134
02:24:38,440 --> 02:24:42,200
Other stuff really became way more important to take care of and do

1135
02:24:43,559 --> 02:24:48,760
And it became one of those streams that just fell through the cracks maybe temporarily until some of the other stuff get done

1136
02:24:49,319 --> 02:24:55,780
No, it wasn't a car accident thing

1137
02:24:58,729 --> 02:25:00,729
fortnight vape stream I

1138
02:25:03,959 --> 02:25:08,159
Will do that stream one day before I retire for real

1139
02:25:08,159 --> 02:25:13,280
I'm gonna do the vape guy playing fortnight joke. I'm gonna I

1140
02:25:13,840 --> 02:25:18,000
Don't know when I don't know how but I'm gonna do that stream

1141
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:25,200
the daycare stream

1142
02:25:25,479 --> 02:25:36,280
Okay, I'll talk okay, I'm gonna talk about it because it's stupid

1143
02:25:38,649 --> 02:25:43,290
Community Jake told me also that this is probably a bad idea. Let's not do it and I was like, okay fine

1144
02:25:44,010 --> 02:25:48,909
there was a stream idea a while back where I

1145
02:25:49,629 --> 02:25:55,040
Announced to the stream that I was operating at daycare and that guys, you know

1146
02:25:55,040 --> 02:25:58,520
I'm just trying to make some extra money on the side here. I'm operating a daycare and

1147
02:25:59,280 --> 02:26:02,200
I'm gonna be operating it in we got some of these children here

1148
02:26:02,239 --> 02:26:04,239
I'm gonna be taking care of them and

1149
02:26:04,239 --> 02:26:06,239
it was gonna be like

1150
02:26:06,479 --> 02:26:15,290
like a half dozen like babies in like baby things back here and I was gonna periodically get them gonna be those babies that like

1151
02:26:15,770 --> 02:26:19,889
Made the sounds and stuff and like I had to go feed them and it was gonna be like a look

1152
02:26:19,889 --> 02:26:21,489
I'm feeding the babies thing

1153
02:26:21,489 --> 02:26:24,610
Where it went off the rails is some crazy stuff was gonna happen

1154
02:26:24,770 --> 02:26:31,489
We're like a bear was gonna fucking attack my office and I was gonna have to like defend the babies from a bear and shit

1155
02:26:31,530 --> 02:26:35,170
And like crazy stuff was gonna happen. I was gonna have to like fight for them and fight again

1156
02:26:35,170 --> 02:26:38,489
There's gonna be they were gonna like be able to vote for what I was gonna play next on stream

1157
02:26:38,530 --> 02:26:43,190
I'm not real babies like bait like dolls

1158
02:26:43,350 --> 02:26:44,670
What are you talking about?

1159
02:26:44,670 --> 02:27:02,600
like small infant baby dolls that just sit back here and I'm like running a daycare and I have to like defend them from like a

1160
02:27:03,520 --> 02:27:09,280
Bear is coming in and I fight the bear and like and maybe one of the babies like gets up and like attacks the bear and shit

1161
02:27:09,799 --> 02:27:12,930
That sounds awesome though

1162
02:27:13,129 --> 02:27:24,190
But it got to a point where I was like, you know what this probably isn't this probably isn't a great idea and

1163
02:27:24,850 --> 02:27:26,170
Community Jake is just like yeah

1164
02:27:26,170 --> 02:27:30,250
Let's like leave this one on the cutting room floor because like I don't think that this is gonna work and I'm like, yeah

1165
02:27:30,250 --> 02:27:32,250
You know what? This probably is gonna be hard to make work

1166
02:27:32,770 --> 02:27:46,690
Who would possibly worry about it being real? Well, not that it was real, but I don't know

1167
02:27:47,209 --> 02:27:54,819
Especially if like the babies we're gonna be back here like making noises while I was sitting here like talking and like streaming

1168
02:27:54,819 --> 02:27:58,040
I mean, look, let me be honest

1169
02:27:58,079 --> 02:28:03,079
Is that as bad as me wanting to do another one that got shut down another one that got shut down

1170
02:28:03,639 --> 02:28:09,440
Is I wanted to second cat boy stream and I wanted to shit in the litter box that was in the corner of the room

1171
02:28:09,799 --> 02:28:12,120
Is that is that the same? Is that just as bad?

1172
02:28:12,920 --> 02:28:19,200
That one got shut down too

1173
02:28:36,190 --> 02:28:38,190
You guys don't know

1174
02:28:38,190 --> 02:28:42,040
There's a lot of ideas that pass through like a small treatment

1175
02:28:42,440 --> 02:28:49,930
That me and community Jake will sit to call for like an hour and we'll be like, yeah, I mean, okay

1176
02:28:49,930 --> 02:28:51,489
So the for the second cat boy stream

1177
02:28:51,489 --> 02:28:55,170
What if there was like just cat toys around the room and I'm like running around chasing them

1178
02:28:55,370 --> 02:28:58,370
Maybe like chat can pick on like what toy I play with

1179
02:28:58,610 --> 02:29:03,329
Like that will there be a big cat tree that I climb up and like sleep on and just sit there for like 10 straight minutes

1180
02:29:03,329 --> 02:29:06,959
Oh, and they'll be like a litter box, too

1181
02:29:06,959 --> 02:29:09,680
and like maybe I'll go over to the litter box and maybe I'll shit in the litter box and

1182
02:29:10,239 --> 02:29:14,739
It's just like whoa. Well, hold on a minute Jeremy back back up for a second. What do you want to do?

1183
02:29:15,219 --> 02:29:18,780
And I'm like, well, no, I'm just saying like I'm just trying to think of like things that like funny shit to do

1184
02:29:19,299 --> 02:29:26,979
But I wouldn't actually guys. I wouldn't have actually shit in a litter box on stream

1185
02:29:27,299 --> 02:29:30,540
it would be like I would just go be a cat in the litter box and

1186
02:29:30,940 --> 02:29:35,729
Like that would be and like that would be like you're like, oh, okay. We're gonna go to BRB

1187
02:29:35,729 --> 02:29:53,010
He's like using the litter box. I can't reach this you need to fire community Jake

1188
02:29:53,569 --> 02:29:56,000
No, I'm sorry

1189
02:29:56,200 --> 02:30:07,209
I'm trying to think of all this stuff that I kind of thought of would be like kind of funny for a second

1190
02:30:07,209 --> 02:30:13,559
Then I'm like, no, actually, maybe I don't think I wanted really want to do that one. What else stop cutting logs. Oh

1191
02:30:14,840 --> 02:30:16,600
Fuck I am you're right

1192
02:30:16,600 --> 02:30:25,209
Hey, what about the AS? Yeah, the ASMR stream too. That's another one. That's gone

1193
02:30:25,530 --> 02:30:31,440
That was the one where I wanted to have a marching band come in in the middle of the stream and like while I'm still talking

1194
02:30:32,319 --> 02:30:40,270
That was another one where I wanted to I wanted to like shit like shave

1195
02:30:41,069 --> 02:30:43,590
Do like a oh, it's you're at the barber getting shaved

1196
02:30:44,469 --> 02:30:51,959
Stop giving up on these good ideas

1197
02:30:53,840 --> 02:31:00,500
I mean, here's the doll look a lot of stuff hits the cutting room floor for various reasons

1198
02:31:00,819 --> 02:31:14,600
I'm gonna have full creative control in quotes lol guys

1199
02:31:14,600 --> 02:31:18,659
I think that backtracking on the I'm gonna shit in a litter box on stream joke

1200
02:31:19,180 --> 02:31:22,780
It's not what you are describing right there with what you just said. I

1201
02:31:27,280 --> 02:31:32,860
Think that is very reasonable that I would maybe be like maybe not maybe not that one

1202
02:31:39,159 --> 02:31:51,780
He's not he's brand friendly you came up with the idea I

1203
02:31:54,120 --> 02:32:01,360
Have a notebook that I I have a notebook that I just write shit in

1204
02:32:01,879 --> 02:32:24,319
It's I fill it with shit. This is way too tall. That's gonna be it, right? There we go

1205
02:32:24,639 --> 02:32:33,129
What do you say you say what?

1206
02:32:33,809 --> 02:32:40,739
Few years ago you talked on on the on criticals podcast about the courtroom thing. What was that?

1207
02:32:41,420 --> 02:32:43,100
All right, I can talk about that

1208
02:32:43,139 --> 02:32:49,780
I was gonna go on trial for killing Santa Claus and we were gonna have a courtroom and I was gonna be on trial for it

1209
02:32:50,299 --> 02:32:53,860
but it wasn't gonna be like a normal court is gonna be like kind of like a magical court and

1210
02:32:54,819 --> 02:33:00,500
Santa's lawyer was gonna be like sing his prosecution at the jury and shit and I was gonna get pissed off and

1211
02:33:01,020 --> 02:33:07,340
it's gonna be like a magical Christmas stream where I'm just this evil fucking awful person and

1212
02:33:09,819 --> 02:33:13,129
The problem there was a lot of stuff that was gonna happen on that stream

1213
02:33:15,270 --> 02:33:16,629
Unfortunately

1214
02:33:16,629 --> 02:33:19,120
kind of ran out of time because

1215
02:33:19,639 --> 02:33:26,040
That was also right in the period where I was gonna start to move. I was right before moving to Vegas and

1216
02:33:26,840 --> 02:33:29,120
the you killed Santa routine

1217
02:33:29,760 --> 02:33:35,719
Wasn't really relevant anymore. And like a year goes by two years go by and I think in the chat

1218
02:33:35,719 --> 02:33:41,760
I made jokes about oh, you know, the legal system sure does take a long time or something, but it never ended up happening

1219
02:33:42,399 --> 02:33:55,440
What's happening? What am I doing?

1220
02:33:56,399 --> 02:34:19,170
Did I pick up how many logs do I have? This is what I need, right? Oh shit

1221
02:34:23,209 --> 02:34:29,040
What do I have? Oh

1222
02:34:29,959 --> 02:34:36,420
Yeah stuff hits the cutting room floor

1223
02:34:37,180 --> 02:34:41,520
One of the other things I could probably think of what if it's another one that like I was like, yeah, probably not

1224
02:34:41,959 --> 02:34:48,819
There is one that I actually still want to do and it's not it's the one we originally brought up

1225
02:34:53,750 --> 02:34:59,610
The one that I that was originally brought up is not the one you haven't I haven't said it yet

1226
02:35:00,090 --> 02:35:06,959
Because I think that one actually might still happen it's possible

1227
02:35:07,520 --> 02:35:19,729
So I'm not gonna spoil that one. I'll spoil the ones that you are guaranteed to not happen like the German daycare stream

1228
02:35:19,729 --> 02:35:37,850
Oh, yeah, there's the chocolate factory stream where I was gonna go and pretend like I had a chocolate factory and do this whole

1229
02:35:37,850 --> 02:35:44,010
Willy Wonka routine where we had to eliminate people or something. I don't know what that I don't know what fucks wrong with me sometimes

1230
02:35:44,809 --> 02:36:03,959
Hey, looks good

1231
02:36:03,959 --> 02:36:13,200
More planks. Give me what about your book? Yeah, I know

1232
02:36:13,760 --> 02:36:17,959
I'm aware

1233
02:36:17,959 --> 02:36:38,520
Eliminate people like you get eliminated from like the like Willy Wonka need more these planks 30 webcam stream

1234
02:36:38,520 --> 02:36:59,969
That was another one. Yeah, who will replace me stuff should have been streamers. Well, the reason why I wanted it to be

1235
02:37:01,129 --> 02:37:03,569
actors and not like other streamers

1236
02:37:04,090 --> 02:37:05,610
it's because

1237
02:37:05,610 --> 02:37:09,219
It I don't know having to be other streamers almost feels

1238
02:37:10,020 --> 02:37:12,659
Like it's too

1239
02:37:12,659 --> 02:37:19,940
Having actors is almost more real to me because like I wouldn't have another streamer to take like they're they're already a streamer

1240
02:37:20,340 --> 02:37:29,510
Like if I go let's get a bunch of like streamers together to do this. It'd be like these are just streamers that you know

1241
02:37:30,110 --> 02:37:33,659
You don't know any of those actors. Maybe you did

1242
02:37:34,360 --> 02:37:50,200
What do you mean actors? I mean the actors that came in to try to take my role from me. So I mean

1243
02:37:53,479 --> 02:37:55,479
Thankfully they were actors. Yeah

1244
02:37:55,879 --> 02:38:04,709
What are you talking about I got a bunch of actors together

1245
02:38:05,389 --> 02:38:13,639
To see like who could do me the best it came down to if we didn't really need them

1246
02:38:14,159 --> 02:38:16,159
because I wasn't ready and

1247
02:38:20,120 --> 02:38:30,639
we had a little bullshit happen at the end of that stream and thankfully I was able to you know

1248
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:35,420
Do what I needed to do and prove my case to whoever I needed to prove it to of course like dr

1249
02:38:35,420 --> 02:38:37,959
Schmolikson and Ludwig and those guys and they took care of that fucking weird guy

1250
02:38:38,440 --> 02:38:40,440
one of those weird actor

1251
02:38:40,440 --> 02:38:53,500
Yeah, they're like as I was a good actor

1252
02:38:53,700 --> 02:39:01,120
They got rid of the actor and I get to continue to do what I want to do and I'm not gone yet

1253
02:39:01,120 --> 02:39:22,239
I don't have to stop like I'm fine. Yeah, somebody was shot. What I mean, we figured it out. We got the right person

1254
02:39:22,239 --> 02:39:29,819
It's easy. You are the everybody already knows that you could see through it was clear as day

1255
02:39:30,260 --> 02:39:34,229
I'm trying to put forth like the illusion

1256
02:39:34,790 --> 02:39:41,059
You know of you know, obviously don't want people to think I'm like retiring

1257
02:39:41,819 --> 02:39:54,719
Not I'm just still going stir shot you on purpose

1258
02:39:56,139 --> 02:39:58,139
Nobody shot me. Okay, I

1259
02:40:00,389 --> 02:40:02,389
Did nobody shot me? I?

1260
02:40:02,750 --> 02:40:06,149
watched as somebody was being a little ridiculous and

1261
02:40:06,670 --> 02:40:26,639
Game was rigged from the start. You're not the real German then. Who am I then?

1262
02:40:27,079 --> 02:40:28,200
Huh?

1263
02:40:28,200 --> 02:40:32,579
I'm not the real German of a hot cup of cider hot cup of coffee

1264
02:40:33,260 --> 02:40:34,709
What?

1265
02:40:34,709 --> 02:40:36,799
hot cup of cider

1266
02:40:36,799 --> 02:40:43,450
How much more do I need to prove that I'm real?

1267
02:40:44,090 --> 02:40:54,719
This is long, huh?

1268
02:40:54,719 --> 02:40:56,000
Aaron

1269
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,319
Aaron

1270
02:40:58,319 --> 02:41:00,760
Let me tell you something really important though

1271
02:41:00,879 --> 02:41:08,319
If that was to be a show where that would happen, right my favorite part of that show

1272
02:41:09,809 --> 02:41:15,659
100% besides obviously like the errand stuff is the fact that some you know

1273
02:41:16,040 --> 02:41:21,750
People were given material to potentially look at and see kind of you know

1274
02:41:21,750 --> 02:41:25,110
Who that person could be and what's that person like on camera?

1275
02:41:25,670 --> 02:41:31,479
They may have had a whole package made for them, right if that were if that were the case and the fact that

1276
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,040
Oh

1277
02:41:34,040 --> 02:41:41,379
Got cider hot cup of coffee hot cup of cocoa is the thing like the aspect the AI

1278
02:41:42,020 --> 02:41:49,930
Was given one thing and then wrote a book about it, right? I that's my favorite part is oh, yeah hot cup of cider

1279
02:41:50,389 --> 02:41:52,629
That's what I do. That's me

1280
02:41:53,590 --> 02:41:56,209
I

1281
02:41:56,250 --> 02:41:58,819
Love it so much. Oh

1282
02:41:58,819 --> 02:42:04,139
So welcome. How are you? Oh, yeah hot cup of cocoa. Oh, yeah, that's me. That's what I do. That's my thing

1283
02:42:04,139 --> 02:42:06,700
That's all I do. Oh

1284
02:42:07,020 --> 02:42:12,389
So I loved it. Oh, can I get a look at me, please?

1285
02:42:15,530 --> 02:42:19,309
The best part is how everybody wanted to play Dark Souls and

1286
02:42:22,090 --> 02:42:28,639
Here okay, so here's some lore on that stream a lot of those guys didn't know anything about Dark Souls

1287
02:42:28,680 --> 02:42:34,450
They didn't even know what it was. So watching them struggle with like the mouse and like trying to

1288
02:42:34,809 --> 02:42:42,969
Swing and like take one after one by one by one. They would come in. Oh, I'm gonna play in Dark Souls like oh

1289
02:42:43,450 --> 02:42:46,020
Okay, I don't think you want to do that

1290
02:42:46,659 --> 02:43:01,319
Getting into like the tutorial room and then Octo pimp comes in and just like beats it first try that was so goddamn funny

1291
02:43:01,600 --> 02:43:07,909
No, I loved that. That was so much fun again

1292
02:43:07,909 --> 02:43:10,930
If you if you don't know we're talking about or if you do

1293
02:43:11,129 --> 02:43:15,040
All those audio problems and all like the stream lagging problems

1294
02:43:15,809 --> 02:43:20,770
We have like twitch server issues as well as like kind of issues with our connection like at the venue

1295
02:43:20,850 --> 02:43:25,969
so a lot of those random audio issues that would like

1296
02:43:28,170 --> 02:43:31,520
Most of those are gone in the VOD that's on the archive channel

1297
02:43:31,520 --> 02:43:40,540
So it still pops up a little bit but not even remotely close as much as it did before

1298
02:43:40,819 --> 02:43:51,600
Okay, I gotta stop like walking up and down the ladder and actually do this. I need them to be thin like that

1299
02:43:51,719 --> 02:44:10,799
Okay, we just need to cut down a bunch of trees got it. They gotta be long. Okay speedrun

1300
02:44:25,040 --> 02:44:31,030
Is there any behind-the-scenes stuff from that show? Oh, there might be I think there's a few things

1301
02:44:31,030 --> 02:44:36,409
Yeah, I know that um, I know Holly had some behind-the-scenes stuff

1302
02:44:36,409 --> 02:44:40,950
I think there's a few videos some pictures and stuff that she had maybe we'll see

1303
02:44:41,309 --> 02:44:46,809
You know what? I also have which I just realized the other day I have

1304
02:44:47,409 --> 02:44:55,280
You know, I don't want you to do that stuff. I have a bunch of cut

1305
02:44:55,680 --> 02:45:02,559
Bugleberry hot tub for hot tub footage of stuff that was not in there. It's not on that stream

1306
02:45:03,079 --> 02:45:11,959
Maybe I'll like cut that up and just show it

1307
02:45:12,520 --> 02:45:32,270
Here release the bugleberry footage. No, stop doing this. There's so many of these planks now

1308
02:45:32,790 --> 02:45:54,579
The Elbertson cut how many do I need? One, two, three, four five like one more

1309
02:45:54,579 --> 02:46:12,899
I don't do it and then I think this is pretty close. I just put on the top layer

1310
02:46:13,420 --> 02:46:17,930
These are these planks. Okay. I actually have a lot of planks already

1311
02:46:25,440 --> 02:46:39,520
Good thing. I had these cut. This is a chill game. Even though it's very very simple. It's I don't know. It's cool. I like it

1312
02:46:40,040 --> 02:46:56,559
This is what actually a house looks like. How come it's so engaging. I just is it's just I don't know something about it

1313
02:46:56,559 --> 02:47:00,670
Just like it's really nice. I love playing games like these on stream

1314
02:47:01,069 --> 02:47:02,989
It'll it allows

1315
02:47:02,989 --> 02:47:05,309
It allows for some just we can just talk about whatever

1316
02:47:05,829 --> 02:47:13,079
It's fun. We can just it just can just sit in the background while we just talk. It's fun

1317
02:47:18,360 --> 02:47:25,719
Over here. Oh, I need one more. There we go

1318
02:47:27,559 --> 02:47:34,549
It's time for the roof. These are planks as well. Oh shit. It's a lot of planks. All right

1319
02:47:35,209 --> 02:47:37,049
Start the process

1320
02:47:37,049 --> 02:47:57,280
Got it. My favorite was the one that did the Yoda impression

1321
02:47:58,459 --> 02:48:04,659
Yeah, he's great. They were all great though. They were they were all so cool about everything. They're all so fun

1322
02:48:08,360 --> 02:48:10,399
They're incredibly talented, too

1323
02:48:10,959 --> 02:48:21,209
It just it's so it's cool to because a lot of those guys were just gonna we just had a casting company help us find all

1324
02:48:21,209 --> 02:48:23,409
those actors and

1325
02:48:23,409 --> 02:48:25,510
It's crazy to see just how

1326
02:48:26,250 --> 02:48:28,290
People have so many interesting things that they can do

1327
02:48:29,129 --> 02:48:31,569
Talents things that they think are funny things that they can do. I

1328
02:48:32,170 --> 02:48:36,709
Love that shit. I think it's it's really cool. I love doing that

1329
02:48:37,190 --> 02:48:42,879
So another reason why like okay like for a lot of these things could I just have like a few streamers do it

1330
02:48:42,879 --> 02:48:46,319
I mean, yeah, but I think it's more fun to like see

1331
02:48:46,959 --> 02:48:52,700
Like other what other people are doing and have some like kind of actors that you don't really know people that you don't see on

1332
02:48:52,700 --> 02:48:54,340
stream be able to show

1333
02:48:54,379 --> 02:49:01,799
I'm doing stuff. I that's a huge reason why like I mean obviously dr. Spokes and

1334
02:49:04,989 --> 02:49:09,149
dr. Smokin is awesome, and he's

1335
02:49:10,489 --> 02:49:12,690
incredibly nice wonderful person and

1336
02:49:14,680 --> 02:49:17,649
years ago just kind of like just

1337
02:49:19,020 --> 02:49:28,250
Roped him into the channel and he's just been kind of here ever since it was awesome

1338
02:49:28,250 --> 02:49:31,559
When I knew that I was gonna do that show it's like, okay any judges

1339
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:38,219
What do I want to judge that and then the very obvious choices are like okay who like streamer friends and

1340
02:49:39,500 --> 02:49:45,809
Like obviously like stir right stir obviously has been around for a very long time if somebody knows in quotes, Jerma

1341
02:49:45,969 --> 02:49:53,920
It's gonna be stir. It's be people like stir italics and like Ludwig Ludwig is like kind of

1342
02:49:54,940 --> 02:49:58,659
Like at the last few years. I kind of really started to talk to him and get to know him a little better

1343
02:49:59,459 --> 02:50:01,459
so it's kind of like old

1344
02:50:01,620 --> 02:50:09,020
German 985 new German 985 and then like dr. Schmeichsen it was it was just fun. It was really cool

1345
02:50:09,020 --> 02:50:12,370
I loved it. I told you that that was gonna be one of my favorite streams

1346
02:50:12,409 --> 02:50:18,040
And it was I had so much fun doing that show that I'm like sad

1347
02:50:18,040 --> 02:50:32,850
It's gone, and I want to do it like I want to do it again. Who is dr. Schmeichsen? I mean

1348
02:50:33,370 --> 02:50:35,370
It's dr. Schmeichsen, you know

1349
02:50:35,850 --> 02:50:48,590
Doc the doctor, but that's a whole we talked about evolved earlier in the stream and how I'm signed with evolved

1350
02:50:48,969 --> 02:50:55,819
It's to be able to do more stuff like that and have shows paid for have brands be able to come in and help

1351
02:50:55,819 --> 02:50:56,840
I

1352
02:50:56,840 --> 02:51:03,549
Want to do that stuff that stuff means more to me than anything else. I think you guys are you guys know that?

1353
02:51:03,549 --> 02:51:14,450
I don't think I have to explain that I love what I'm doing right now because this is its own different kind of beast

1354
02:51:14,930 --> 02:51:20,229
Right sitting here streaming a game chillin talking just made fucking around making jokes, whatever

1355
02:51:20,989 --> 02:51:30,209
But like I will always remember all those shows and you're probably noticing behind me on the reddit shelf I put

1356
02:51:30,610 --> 02:51:32,610
once the show is done I

1357
02:51:32,649 --> 02:51:39,299
Put it up there. I put like a little token on the shelf just enough not enough for any reason just cuz like oh

1358
02:51:39,299 --> 02:51:43,540
Yeah, I like it. It's like it's a fun kind of memory of like remembering that. Oh, yeah, I remember doing that

1359
02:51:43,540 --> 02:51:51,190
That was cool. What about the dagger? I mean that was not supposed to be on there. It was just there temporarily

1360
02:51:52,030 --> 02:51:56,239
So I know people probably like why is there like a fucking dagger?

1361
02:51:56,360 --> 02:52:09,040
What is what is the dagger for and I mean maybe it is like a little cheesy is like a little corny whatever

1362
02:52:09,200 --> 02:52:14,159
Well, I don't it's not it's nice to walk in the room and be like oh, yeah, that was fun

1363
02:52:14,559 --> 02:52:27,729
Let us see it. Sure. I mean there's a there's a new addition

1364
02:52:27,770 --> 02:52:41,229
There's a couple of there that I think I would want to put something up there for but I haven't as you see

1365
02:52:41,510 --> 02:52:44,850
You notice something up there

1366
02:52:44,850 --> 02:52:52,770
Yeah, like you got and it's like but streams that I think really had a great time with if you notice on that

1367
02:52:52,770 --> 02:52:56,889
I don't think I've really talked about this. It's kind of interesting because I don't think I've ever said this

1368
02:52:57,290 --> 02:53:05,290
Look at the games that are up there too. All right, the thing is on there. The movies is on there. See man is up there

1369
02:53:05,450 --> 02:53:12,440
Yeah, the the the Funko pops are kind of being pushed out

1370
02:53:12,479 --> 02:53:15,350
Oh, yeah, it's that most of that stuff is like

1371
02:53:15,350 --> 02:53:17,190
Oh, this is stuff that I stream that I thought was cool

1372
02:53:17,190 --> 02:53:27,200
I thought was fun one of the rocks from archaeology, of course Pac-Man the Wii I think what's down there?

1373
02:53:27,200 --> 02:53:42,979
I'm gonna remember where's the fedora up there. I think there's a couple other things I should put up there from the New Year's stream

1374
02:53:42,979 --> 02:53:50,379
Oh, yeah, the goats from the carnival. The book in the potion is from the hot tub

1375
02:53:50,659 --> 02:53:53,940
Hats from the last one the replacement stream

1376
02:53:54,959 --> 02:53:58,520
985 is dollhouse obviously grotto beast is right next to it. See man is right there

1377
02:53:58,760 --> 02:54:06,569
The archaeology thing is right there the big geode I'm surprised nobody's noticed this one

1378
02:54:06,729 --> 02:54:09,989
You see what's all the way in the left on the one two three on the third shelf

1379
02:54:10,129 --> 02:54:17,600
You guys see what that is. It's a rat

1380
02:54:18,040 --> 02:54:33,059
It's a rat with a Christmas hat on and the Bluetooth is a Bluetooth brush sitting on them. Yeah, I mean it's a little

1381
02:54:33,059 --> 02:54:38,399
Is it a little corny? Maybe it's a little corny. Well, I don't know

1382
02:54:38,440 --> 02:54:44,219
You know, it's gonna be sad if like I kind of taking that down, right? Oh

1383
02:54:48,950 --> 02:54:50,149
Oh

1384
02:54:50,149 --> 02:54:55,399
Time to get existential at times to get time to get real again. Oh, I mean a lot of you guys know

1385
02:54:55,879 --> 02:55:01,889
that I mean, I'm not gonna do this forever and how I

1386
02:55:02,590 --> 02:55:10,159
Decide on when and how that I'm gonna do something else from here. I don't know what that looks like yet, but

1387
02:55:11,799 --> 02:55:13,079
eventually

1388
02:55:13,079 --> 02:55:18,340
Eventually, I need to start to figure that out and I'm starting to piece together

1389
02:55:18,860 --> 02:55:41,559
What I would want to do after this let's let him on the roof. Okay on the other way

1390
02:55:41,719 --> 02:55:50,059
All right, whatever. I just need planks. Yeah, like what what do I want to do?

1391
02:55:50,200 --> 02:55:52,360
What do I do? I want what do I want to continue to do?

1392
02:55:52,360 --> 02:55:57,440
I have a few ideas things that I'd like to do where I wouldn't just like disappear completely, right?

1393
02:55:57,440 --> 02:56:06,200
I don't know. I don't know what that looks like yet, but I've I made the reference and I made the kind of I

1394
02:56:07,649 --> 02:56:14,770
Teased this in a way when I talked about like how I've been like my 10-year anniversary, which was last year, you know

1395
02:56:14,770 --> 02:56:16,770
It's like I don't know how much longer

1396
02:56:17,209 --> 02:56:21,610
I'm going to do this, but I'm just gonna keep doing it until I'm done whenever that is

1397
02:56:22,250 --> 02:56:45,290
Should run for president. No, I don't want to do that, but it's it's tricky because

1398
02:56:46,170 --> 02:56:52,540
You spend so much time doing something right and it's something that you care about cuz think I there hasn't been

1399
02:56:53,260 --> 02:57:00,459
Talk about like channel changes and trying to keep myself interested and keep myself going and I

1400
02:57:00,819 --> 02:57:05,100
Want to like want to fucking be here in the chair and not like feel like I have to be here in the chair

1401
02:57:05,100 --> 02:57:11,729
right, I think that kind of just goes to the reason why like the whole sponsorship stuff and

1402
02:57:12,250 --> 02:57:14,620
trying to make things easier from on myself and

1403
02:57:15,139 --> 02:57:21,379
There's been a long time to join the circus. Oh

1404
02:57:22,459 --> 02:57:33,899
These are too long. No, they're too short. Come on. Well now I fucked this whole thing up. Come here

1405
02:57:34,059 --> 02:57:50,420
You're gonna make me cry. No, that's not the whole that's not the intention. This house looks good. This guy can't stop talking about retiring

1406
02:57:51,979 --> 02:57:56,840
It's all he talks about

1407
02:57:57,000 --> 02:58:04,079
Well, I know you maybe we talked about the reddit shelf and all like the things that are on it and then

1408
02:58:04,479 --> 02:58:11,040
Thinking about like the future and then I put some more shows up there and then but but I I'm going anywhere

1409
02:58:11,399 --> 02:58:23,760
Like a door. Oh, but realistically speaking

1410
02:58:24,930 --> 02:58:32,440
TM I have to start to think about that stuff. I'm not 25 anymore

1411
02:58:32,680 --> 02:58:34,149
All right

1412
02:58:34,149 --> 02:58:44,190
I gotta start to think about what it means in the future and if I say the word retirement one more time

1413
02:58:44,229 --> 02:58:48,819
I will gift

1414
02:58:48,860 --> 02:59:00,629
