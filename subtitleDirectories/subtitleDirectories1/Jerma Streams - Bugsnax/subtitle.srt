1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:12,650
Odd watchers, go back and watch Die Dallas encounter. I didn't say it, you did. Somebody did. Someone. Someone is.

2
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:15,779
You're gonna die over a handful of chickens.

3
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:17,910
Someone is.

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:27,129
Hi guys. Say Die Dallas the right way, please.

5
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:34,500
Um, Daedalus? Daedalus?

6
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:38,740
Spell it out phonetically for me. Daedalus?

7
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:42,299
Bugsnax?

8
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:44,299
Did I say it right?

9
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,649
Bugsnax.

10
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:54,229
Daedalus. That wasn't Mr. Satan.

11
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,240
No, it wasn't Mr. Satan. That was supposed to be like a half goofy.

12
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,700
Daed- Daed- Hold on, somebody has it here. Daedalus.

13
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:09,099
Daedalus.

14
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:10,780
The Daedalus encounter.

15
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,370
Now the Die Dallas is way better.

16
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:19,049
You guys ever get a word in your head that you pronounce wrong and you know it's not correct?

17
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:23,290
But you don't care because it's in your your own headcanon and that's how you pronounce it.

18
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:29,620
That happens frequently with me.

19
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,659
This game is just putting ketchup on ants. Stop.

20
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:38,150
That's kind of weird.

21
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,859
Ketchup on ants.

22
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:42,859
Fantasy book characters? Yeah.

23
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:48,379
Please eat my yummy bugs.

24
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:53,939
Yuck.

25
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:58,739
There's hot sauce. Wait, do you actually eat bugs in this game? Is this an actual bug eating video game?

26
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,939
I thought that was just the name.

27
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:03,939
Yes, you do. You eat insects.

28
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,980
I guess the game is called Bug Snacks.

29
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,360
It's not called like Bug Trapper.

30
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,490
Or Bug Farm. It's called Bug Snacks.

31
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:21,180
This game is dumb.

32
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,300
All right.

33
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:26,539
People, this was really requested. And plus it came out like what, last week?

34
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:33,460
And?

35
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,770
Ten million dollars

36
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,770
off the debt if he eats a real bug.

37
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:42,490
No, we're in pre-streamed chat. We're talking about this.

38
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,490
I'm not into the whole like eat bugs on camera and scream and cry and stuff when you're eating them.

39
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,569
Why do we think that's cool?

40
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:52,810
That's so strange. That's like bizarre and terrible.

41
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:58,729
For this challenge, you need to eat 12 scorpions in 15 seconds.

42
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:02,219
Why?

43
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:06,729
It's not like it's horrible. That sucks. It probably hurts.

44
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:12,379
And the person's just going like, no, I can't.

45
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:20,379
And then you're sitting on the couch going, yeah, cry. Cry, bitch.

46
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,289
What's wrong with people?

47
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:27,300
Why do we think that's interesting? That's like horrible.

48
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,300
Why would, why do people think that's cool?

49
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,400
I don't know, man. I don't think I could eat another cockroach.

50
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:42,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You'll choke on that fucking cockroach, you piece of shit.

51
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:46,340
Where's the entertainment?

52
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,939
What's the value there?

53
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:59,979
Dude, stop. I'm not trying to get.

54
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,699
Jesus Christ.

55
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,539
Eating bugs is, all right. Oh, let's go.

56
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:14,439
We just got 50 bucks from, well, I say we, but I mean me.

57
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:17,160
We got, why is everything we? You know what I mean?

58
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,240
Okay. Are we going to, what are we going to do here?

59
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:24,040
We just got 50 bucks come in. No, that doesn't work like that, Jeremy.

60
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:30,550
Okay. So what are we going to do? You notice how a lot of streamers and YouTubers, we do that.

61
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,670
Well, it doesn't work. It doesn't work with the money part.

62
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,680
Split it.

63
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:44,790
No, no, that was 5,000 bits from Lucas, the unknown. Thank you, Lucas.

64
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:49,699
And Lucas says my first ever donation to any streamer. Thanks for being here.

65
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:52,389
And then I will always support you.

66
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:54,470
First ever donation. And it's a huge one.

67
00:04:54,949 --> 00:05:00,439
Thanks, dude. For the massive bit drop.

68
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:10,279
First ever donation.

69
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:14,329
Give me my penny.

70
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:19,899
Your bit rate, what?

71
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:23,500
One bit per, all right. Can I talk about something for just a quick second?

72
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,480
You just reminded me of something.

73
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,439
Okay.

74
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:31,480
So there are, there are class action lawsuits, right?

75
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,480
Where some company, I got something in the mail.

76
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:38,600
Like, I don't know, like maybe a year ago.

77
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,319
And it's like, oh, I just want to let you know that you're the class action lawsuit for this you've been a part of.

78
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,319
Yeah, they won. They won. And you can claim your four or five dollars

79
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,660
from the lawsuit.

80
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,860
I'm just sitting there being like, you're gonna send me a check for like five bucks?

81
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,610
What?

82
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,050
Why don't, why don't we just have these guys like rebuild a bunch of schools?

83
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:11,399
Instead of sending everybody that was part of the class action lawsuit, like a few dollars in a check.

84
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,319
Just like fucking take like the 400 million dollars and like redo a whole city block.

85
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:21,220
I don't want the six dollars.

86
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:31,050
We should be able to vote on what happens to that money. I don't want the five dollars.

87
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:33,449
I want you to, I want you to redo a school.

88
00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:42,329
Lawyer Jerma Sanders.

89
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:45,769
That's not, that's not that. No, it's not.

90
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,370
That's communist garbage.

91
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:58,410
It's not, no, it all, look, it already is doing that. They're giving all of us five dollars.

92
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:03,370
I'm just saying utilize that money in a better way. Instead of giving everybody five bucks,

93
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:07,689
let's redo the fucking like a city in, in a state and just pick one.

94
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:15,350
How do you even, would you, you cash a check for five dollars?

95
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:26,470
I'm going to go in there and be like, ah, yeah, here's, here's my check that I got for three dollars and 12 cents.

96
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,790
Uh, I'd like that in ones, please.

97
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:33,379
I'd like that, I'd like that in coins.

98
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:39,670
I'd like that in pennies.

99
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:43,189
And the person behind the counter is like, oh, you want that in ones? Oh shit.

100
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,750
Okay.

101
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,189
One,

102
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:48,550
two,

103
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,550
three. Oh, my fingers are

104
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:52,629
ow, kind of getting tight.

105
00:07:56,649 --> 00:08:00,970
I almost want to like, I almost want to like mail it back and just write like fuck you on the back.

106
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:06,259
Right, fuck you, redo a school.

107
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:18,870
I'm waiting for, get on with it. All right. Yeah, I'm just telling you like we're talking, we're talking here.

108
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,189
That's lawful evil.

109
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:23,819
That's not.

110
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:28,459
Lawful evil would be I would try to find a way to get everybody else's check legally.

111
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:41,419
That's lawful evil.

112
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:43,320
Neutral evil.

113
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,039
Chaotic based hypers. All right, let's go.

114
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:53,610
Long story short, when a class session lawsuit pays out like four dollars a person, no, just like,

115
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:59,539
I'd rather you make like a game show and invite on like 25 people that were part of this lawsuit.

116
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:09,990
And make it like a 10 million dollar game show and put it on tv. Start the game, I'm about to.

117
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,850
Cole's lawsuit. All right, does this game suck?

118
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:29,129
Anybody know? It's based cringe. I don't know that that's an oxymoron. That doesn't make any sense.

119
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,259
Yeah, it's good. All right. This is called bugs.

120
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,120
That was a lot of, you hear that like,

121
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:48,950
uh, it's bug snacks. Ready? I'm ready. It's such a good game. It sucks, but it's cute.

122
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:54,970
I feel like a lot of you say that about me. So should be all right.

123
00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:04,200
Okay, this is us. Is our map.

124
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:13,820
What?

125
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:16,309
Snacks.

126
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:17,269
Move.

127
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:19,429
The sir. Oh, that's that's gotta come down.

128
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,980
That's gotta come down. That's way too crazy.

129
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:30,899
30.

130
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:32,419
Uh, even more.

131
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:36,019
This is made in dreams.

132
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:39,480
It'd be kind of cool if it was actually.

133
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,889
All right, let's go with uh, 18. 18 feels all right.

134
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,889
Keep a little lower.

135
00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:56,490
Still too high. 14. That's good. All right, here we go.

136
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,730
Get a raid.

137
00:10:58,730 --> 00:10:59,769
We raided.

138
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:02,629
What's up?

139
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:08,309
Raid from...

140
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:10,710
Slime. It actually is a slime raid.

141
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,820
Slime sickle.

142
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:17,370
Slime sickle just raided the real slime.

143
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:20,059
This is a real slime raid.

144
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,669
Oh, spider.

145
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,080
Let's pick that up.

146
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,120
But thanks. Welcome everybody. We just, we literally just, I just turned the stream on.

147
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,879
So welcome. You do. You're in for a treat.

148
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:35,320
Thank you. Slime sickle.

149
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,629
Hope you had a good stream.

150
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:42,230
When are you going to be a slime tuber?

151
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:48,259
I don't know.

152
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:49,220
Okay.

153
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,509
I feel like I'm overusing that. Am I overusing like the monkey ass? I feel like I am.

154
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,139
I, I am. I feel like I am.

155
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:01,720
That's a crutch. That's like a comedy crutch and I'm not going to use it anymore.

156
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:07,700
Thought I was going to fall. First fall joke of the evening. Not going to get it here.

157
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,820
This game is, I don't even know.

158
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,139
I was going to say good, but I don't, I haven't played it yet.

159
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:23,940
That was a pizza.

160
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,940
That was a flying pizza.

161
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:31,769
Is it supposed to do something?

162
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:35,210
Two weeks earlier.

163
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:39,620
It's voice acted.

164
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
That's what happens when you mix a walrus and a dachshund.

165
00:12:48,139 --> 00:13:05,929
These are Muffet characters.

166
00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:07,610
Snack tooth island.

167
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:13,879
Oh, how many followers do you have?

168
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,190
I don't even get out of bed for anything less than a thousand.

169
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:27,590
That was rude.

170
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:31,100
Was it? Yeah.

171
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,580
That was wicked rude. You're right. Yeah, that was incredibly rude.

172
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:43,529
Half bug, half snacks.

173
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:44,409
No!

174
00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:52,710
He missed!

175
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,669
Peace.

176
00:13:53,669 --> 00:13:58,500
Boiling grump.

177
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:08,919
Are those weapons around the belt?

178
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:11,720
Soy.

179
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,720
Soy. Yeah, of course.

180
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:21,320
The three-letter word that creates immediate hilarious reaction.

181
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:29,450
Press on somebody to talk.

182
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,450
Oh, how about you? How about Clumby Clumbernut?

183
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:38,620
That's Justin Roiland name for a character if I've ever seen one.

184
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:46,940
I thought that was a cross around her neck.

185
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,940
I was like, oh shit.

186
00:14:56,019 --> 00:14:58,019
Diplomacy only.

187
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:04,019
Reader repulsa.

188
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:06,019
You're already at a second chances.

189
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:08,460
Kinda sounds like her, yeah.

190
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:15,179
After 10,000 years, I'm free.

191
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:17,779
Remember that horse with grumplantis?

192
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:21,779
It's time to conquer Earth.

193
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:24,090
You know the best part about that song,

194
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,090
not that song, that intro,

195
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:30,090
was it pumped you up because that's when the big buildup started to happen.

196
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,090
That like...

197
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:36,090
I got so hyped up when I was a kid.

198
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,090
When she got out and she starts talking

199
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:40,090
and that fucking riff starts playing.

200
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,090
Oh, man. Nothing could wake you up on a Saturday morning

201
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,090
more than that riff.

202
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:50,679
You guys know the Simon from American Idol made that song up?

203
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:54,120
That's his legacy.

204
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,490
He wrote that song.

205
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,490
Yes, it's true.

206
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,490
Simon from fucking American Idol.

207
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,490
Simon, yeah, you look terrible.

208
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:04,659
That guy. He like made that song.

209
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:07,799
Go look it up, I swear to God.

210
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:09,799
Why don't you believe... I'm going.

211
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:11,799
Simon Cowell. Yes, he did.

212
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:15,899
Yes, he did.

213
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:17,899
Go, go Power Rangers.

214
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:19,899
Simon Cowell had a ton to do with it.

215
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:28,259
You know, nobody did the research.

216
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:32,259
Imagine auditioning for American Idol

217
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:34,259
and you do go, go Power Rangers

218
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,259
while just staring at Simon Cowell.

219
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:38,259
Like, you know you're going to lose.

220
00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:40,259
You're going to be one of the joke contestants.

221
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:44,039
Not many people will get it, but you'll get it.

222
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:46,039
You'll be like, go, go Power Rangers

223
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:48,039
while staring right at Simon.

224
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:50,919
And then like when it's all done, you're like,

225
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:52,919
oh, I love that song. I really wish I could

226
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,919
give gratitude to the person that had like

227
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:57,539
produced it and created it.

228
00:16:57,539 --> 00:16:59,539
And he would just be embarrassed and pretend like, snack!

229
00:16:59,539 --> 00:17:11,259
DOV. Outer Wilds.

230
00:17:11,259 --> 00:17:15,609
Yeah, we missed a ton of information.

231
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:18,920
But it's okay.

232
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,920
I feel like the FO... Is the FOV too small?

233
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,380
What is it at 90 right now? 90?

234
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:29,109
It's at 90. What about 95?

235
00:17:29,109 --> 00:17:39,220
Did that even change? It's not doing anything.

236
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:51,430
Uh, there's no FOV difference.

237
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:54,759
That's weird. Is it broken?

238
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:56,759
I feel like it's not 90. This doesn't look like

239
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:58,940
90, does it? Doesn't look like 90 to me.

240
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,750
Do we have to restart the game?

241
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,549
Turn the game up. You got it.

242
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:08,839
I say you got it.

243
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,460
No.

244
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,460
Oh, this is way too fucking loud.

245
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,460
Let's stop listening to you guys.

246
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,369
Alright, who are you?

247
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:23,670
What are you doing here?

248
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,619
What happened?

249
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:36,980
Okay, where's Lizbert?

250
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,980
Mercy killed this guy?

251
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:44,539
You're gonna have to put him down.

252
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:51,099
Well, looks like you're not gonna make it, Filbert.

253
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:53,099
Ah, see you later.

254
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:55,460
See you in hell. Okay.

255
00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:01,220
There's a bug snack right over there.

256
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,220
Did you get a good look at it?

257
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,779
There's a snack over here.

258
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:07,779
Scan the bug snack. Alright, new assignment started.

259
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:09,779
Press F to open the snack scope.

260
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:11,779
Oh, cool.

261
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:13,960
Strabby, a very simple snack.

262
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,960
Watch its walking pattern.

263
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,779
They're a little shy, but that's okay.

264
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:21,400
They just need some space.

265
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,400
Loves, um, coconuts or something.

266
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,400
Okay.

267
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,640
Report to Filbo.

268
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,640
I scanned it.

269
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,640
That one's pretty easy to catch.

270
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,460
Well, me anyway.

271
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:38,460
Simon Cowell had nothing to do with Power Rangers, you goon.

272
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,759
What?

273
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:43,829
Yes, he did. Yes, he did.

274
00:19:43,829 --> 00:19:45,829
He, like, produced it.

275
00:19:45,829 --> 00:19:48,259
Its tracks come out of this bush.

276
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:50,819
The snack trap down there.

277
00:19:50,819 --> 00:19:53,450
He bought the rights.

278
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:55,450
Yes, he did. He had something to do with it.

279
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:57,450
He actually did.

280
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,450
Okay, you don't have your snack trap selected.

281
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,450
Hold Q to open the wheel. Snack trap.

282
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,750
Deploy snack trap.

283
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,750
Catch the bug snack.

284
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,250
Alright, deployed.

285
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,740
Oh, I scared him. Get out here and get eaten.

286
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:32,230
Filbo, what are we doing wrong?

287
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,230
Alright, put that down and hide.

288
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:40,569
Where is he?

289
00:20:40,569 --> 00:20:43,259
Oh shit, I gotta get it before he gets out.

290
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:46,650
I got a Strabby.

291
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:51,900
I'm gonna do all these.

292
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,900
You know I'm gonna do all these voices.

293
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,900
I'm gonna do them. You know I am.

294
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,900
I can't help it.

295
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,900
It made noise. I have to.

296
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,900
Here, have a...

297
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,900
Wait, let me talk to you first.

298
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,339
I kinda wanna just push you in the river now.

299
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:18,339
What the fuck?

300
00:21:18,339 --> 00:21:22,170
Don't eat those.

301
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,579
Poison.

302
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:34,579
Alright.

303
00:21:34,579 --> 00:21:36,579
But I wanna do it

304
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:38,579
as if you were birds.

305
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:40,579
You're my baby bird. I'm gonna chew it up

306
00:21:40,579 --> 00:21:42,579
and I'm gonna spit it into your mouth.

307
00:21:42,579 --> 00:21:44,579
Are you into that? You okay with that?

308
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:46,579
You don't have your snack trap selected.

309
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:50,420
Alright, we need to get three bug snacks.

310
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:54,329
You're a monster.

311
00:21:54,329 --> 00:21:57,210
Okay, let's get three bug snacks.

312
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:01,049
There's definitely gonna be some in here.

313
00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:03,049
You see any strawberries? Alright, I see a peach snake.

314
00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:07,660
What is that?

315
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:16,339
Alright, now go in there.

316
00:22:16,339 --> 00:22:22,359
Got it. It's a Ruto.

317
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:25,049
Scan it. Oh shit.

318
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:27,049
Alright, now we have to get another...

319
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:37,609
Two more.

320
00:22:37,609 --> 00:22:39,609
Didn't scan. You soft-locked it.

321
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:41,609
There's no such thing as a soft-lock

322
00:22:41,609 --> 00:22:44,740
in a bug snack game.

323
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,740
Oh, up there. Scan it.

324
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,519
It's a green lollipop

325
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:52,519
that latches onto snacks and traps

326
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:54,519
with its unsettling long tongue.

327
00:22:54,519 --> 00:23:00,599
Alright, how do I get that? Is there a way I can get that?

328
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:06,680
I need two more.

329
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:12,180
How do I get them?

330
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,180
I need a tool I don't have. Oh, alright, cool.

331
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:18,390
I'm into it.

332
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,390
Wait, there's another one. Alright, hold on.

333
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,819
I can scan it. Scan this carrot now.

334
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:24,819
It's a carrot. Burrows into the soil

335
00:23:24,819 --> 00:23:28,539
when it's scared. Alright.

336
00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:31,609
Put this down. Put this in your

337
00:23:31,609 --> 00:23:33,609
field of view right there.

338
00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:39,859
And hide. What?

339
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:42,230
What are you doing? Give me that back.

340
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:47,029
How do I get that?

341
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:49,029
Give me this back. Why did you do that?

342
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:51,029
What? What does it say?

343
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:53,849
Press E to get it back?

344
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:57,750
E, retrieve. E.

345
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:02,599
E. You're lucky I don't have

346
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:04,599
a fucking gun. Alright.

347
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:15,210
Get out of here.

348
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,579
Got two Roodles. Let's get one more.

349
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:20,460
Does this guy like Roodles?

350
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,680
What kind of food does this guy like?

351
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,500
You see anything? I don't see anything.

352
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,869
Oh, he hates them. Well, I'm sorry.

353
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:32,869
Beggars can't be choosers. If you tell me,

354
00:24:32,869 --> 00:24:34,869
go get me food, but tell me what you don't want.

355
00:24:34,869 --> 00:24:36,869
You don't give me the specifics, like your dietary

356
00:24:36,869 --> 00:24:40,069
restrictions. Like if you say,

357
00:24:40,069 --> 00:24:42,069
hey, go pick up a bunch of food for me. Alright, man.

358
00:24:42,069 --> 00:24:44,069
You into, like,

359
00:24:44,069 --> 00:24:46,309
you into peanuts?

360
00:24:46,309 --> 00:24:49,619
Yeah, sure. Wait, no.

361
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:51,619
Let me redo that. Reset.

362
00:24:51,619 --> 00:24:53,619
Three, two, one.

363
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:55,619
It's like if you got, like, hold on. Reset that again.

364
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,619
In three,

365
00:24:57,619 --> 00:24:59,619
two, one. Okay.

366
00:24:59,619 --> 00:25:01,619
So, like, if you were to order food for somebody,

367
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:03,619
and they said, get whatever, I don't care,

368
00:25:03,619 --> 00:25:05,619
and then you come back with, like, a bag of peanuts, and they go,

369
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:07,619
dude, I'm allergic to peanuts. What the fuck's wrong with you?

370
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:09,619
It's like, dude, you should have told me what you were allergic to

371
00:25:09,619 --> 00:25:11,990
before I went and got food.

372
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,990
Sign it. Ship that. Close it.

373
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:16,940
Cut point right there.

374
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:28,460
Thank you. Where's the joke? No, it wasn't a joke.

375
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,460
It was just, like, a cool reference to, like, cut to.

376
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,660
Alright.

377
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,660
I'm gonna feed this guy.

378
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:41,079
Mmm, carrots.

379
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:43,079
Oh, he's gonna have carrot legs.

380
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:46,019
That's a family guy.

381
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:48,019
No, it's not a family guy.

382
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:55,450
Why would that be awesome?

383
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,450
That would be terrible. That would suck.

384
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:59,450
Alright, well, is there any more rootles or strudels?

385
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:03,099
Ah!

386
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:05,900
Alright, that's the path.

387
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,900
Go ahead. Alright, place that. Hide.

388
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:13,829
Come on out.

389
00:26:13,829 --> 00:26:19,779
Alright, let's move.

390
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:22,789
Is he gonna have a strawberry leg? He is.

391
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:28,869
Why'd I get that close?

392
00:26:33,109 --> 00:26:35,109
Isn't one of the gremlins in Gremlins 2 like this?

393
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:39,480
The vegetable gremlin?

394
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,730
Oh, I'm here to investigate the bug snack.

395
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:53,029
Stop playing this fetish game.

396
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,720
Get out of here.

397
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,619
Alright.

398
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:13,619
Let's put this away.

399
00:27:13,619 --> 00:27:16,700
You're running pretty damn fast, dude.

400
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,829
Alright, what's the right hook button?

401
00:27:28,869 --> 00:27:31,940
Why not?

402
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:38,539
Who knows?

403
00:27:38,539 --> 00:27:40,539
Maybe she will be there when we get back.

404
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:42,539
Is this the actual mayor?

405
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:46,539
Or is this a terrible

406
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:48,539
Halloween costume?

407
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:50,539
Like you're the mayor of Flavortown

408
00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:52,539
and you're just in a white t-shirt and shit.

409
00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:54,539
But you get to make the Guy Fieri joke

410
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,539
every night and people laugh at it

411
00:27:56,539 --> 00:27:58,539
because they're like, oh, that's funny.

412
00:27:58,539 --> 00:28:00,539
Okay, I get it, right?

413
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:02,710
Alright, through here.

414
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:10,710
Yeah.

415
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:16,150
Hahaha.

416
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:18,150
Why are you playing terrible games two days in a row?

417
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:20,150
This is, um, excuse me.

418
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:22,150
People love this game.

419
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,150
This is like a really popular game that people love.

420
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:26,150
Look, I accepted

421
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:28,150
yesterday, but not today.

422
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:36,200
Is that Chris Metzen?

423
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:52,859
It is. That's Chris Metzen.

424
00:28:56,859 --> 00:28:59,160
That's Chris Metzen.

425
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,160
He's like, he gave his voice to the game.

426
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,160
He's a blizzard.

427
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,160
He clearly says

428
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,160
Wumfest.

429
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,180
That was weird.

430
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,180
Ketchup?

431
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,180
There's a hamburger bug.

432
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:32,829
Wait, there's hamburger bugs.

433
00:29:42,829 --> 00:29:48,450
Bunger.

434
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,450
Alright, press on a nearby sauce farm.

435
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:52,819
Alright, let's get some sauce.

436
00:29:52,819 --> 00:29:55,380
Ketchup.

437
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,380
Alright, fill it up. I have, how much ketchup do I need?

438
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,380
Might as well fill the whole thing.

439
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,549
Alright, now lower the

440
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,549
Bunger into the pen.

441
00:30:03,549 --> 00:30:09,440
Come on over here, Bunger.

442
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:19,279
Bunger! Get in there.

443
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:23,950
We get to split this, right?

444
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,950
Bunger, Bunger, Bunger, Bunger.

445
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,950
Bunger, Bunger, Bunger, Bunger.

446
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:36,849
I love this cheeseburger guy.

447
00:30:36,849 --> 00:30:40,240
Alright.

448
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,309
Alright, check on Philbo.

449
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:46,700
Like fell down here, right?

450
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,609
They're like Pokemon.

451
00:30:50,609 --> 00:30:52,609
Can they fall down here? Where is he?

452
00:30:52,609 --> 00:30:56,829
Wait, scan that thing. Yeah, scan these.

453
00:30:56,829 --> 00:30:58,829
Alright, it's a french fry bug.

454
00:30:58,829 --> 00:31:01,329
Climbs onto high walls out of reach, but will come down

455
00:31:01,329 --> 00:31:03,329
if it smells ketchup.

456
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:27,950
Hold on, let me do this right.

457
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:34,019
Got a fryer.

458
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:36,700
Alright, what about this thing? Something in here.

459
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:43,549
Wait, what was this one? Scan it first

460
00:31:43,549 --> 00:31:47,200
before I catch it. It was a bush.

461
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,430
Alright, get out.

462
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:55,700
Tasty enemy fryer.

463
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:59,470
Alright, there's a burger snack.

464
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:01,470
Knocks away traps. It also tackles anything

465
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,470
covered in ketchup. Wait a minute.

466
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:08,269
Does it now? Does it now?

467
00:32:08,269 --> 00:32:12,240
Come tackle this and

468
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,500
break this guy out of here.

469
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,559
Bunger. Hey.

470
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:24,380
Get over here. Check that out.

471
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:30,339
What's that? No!

472
00:32:30,339 --> 00:32:41,339
We went the wrong way. I can't catch him?

473
00:32:41,339 --> 00:32:47,150
Wait, give me this back.

474
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:49,710
Alright, cover that in ketchup.

475
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,710
Oh my fucking god, you idiot.

476
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,710
Alright, hold on. I'm gonna get this.

477
00:32:53,710 --> 00:33:00,990
Alright, Bunger, this way.

478
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:05,710
Bunger, look.

479
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:08,079
Check that out. No, no, no, no.

480
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:11,730
Wrong way. Come back here.

481
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,730
This game is fucking dope.

482
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:25,869
Get back here.

483
00:33:25,869 --> 00:33:28,299
Yes, yes.

484
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:31,359
Now go crash into that.

485
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:36,859
Here we go.

486
00:33:36,859 --> 00:33:38,859
Oh, snipe.

487
00:33:38,859 --> 00:33:43,539
I didn't scan him. Oops.

488
00:33:43,539 --> 00:33:45,539
Shishkebug. Wait, there's a shishkebug over here.

489
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:47,839
Once this pest hides,

490
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:49,839
it won't come out of hiding until it's forced.

491
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:52,079
Yep, alright, cool.

492
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:54,079
Let's get this guy again.

493
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:57,599
Wait, he's pretty stupid. He might just walk into it.

494
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:04,180
Oh, stupid.

495
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:12,239
Break him out. Why can't I pick up

496
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:18,059
the burger bugs?

497
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:20,239
You're a stupid. Why am I stupid?

498
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,610
Alright, where's Philbo?

499
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:24,610
He fell off this bridge.

500
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:26,780
Hey. Oh, very nice.

501
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,920
Wait, there he is.

502
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:34,380
Do you want some food?

503
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,820
Need a different trap. Okay.

504
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,820
Okay.

505
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,300
I already got two of them.

506
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,300
You want some?

507
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,300
Got it already.

508
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,300
Oh man, your food has already arrived.

509
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,690
Your food already arrived.

510
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,099
I gave him a weapon.

511
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,750
I got those too.

512
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,690
Oh, he wants two of these?

513
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:57,570
Are these tomatoes?

514
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,570
They have tomato, garlic, butts, and beef bums?

515
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,570
Beef? I don't know.

516
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:03,570
They look like they're garlic and beef and mushrooms and bums.

517
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,590
How do I get them?

518
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,590
Okay. You got the bug net.

519
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,590
Now you can pick up bug snacks when they're stunned.

520
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:29,179
Really?

521
00:36:29,179 --> 00:36:31,940
Oh, shit. Let me go.

522
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,369
Catch this thing with the net.

523
00:36:34,369 --> 00:36:37,889
Where's the net?

524
00:36:37,889 --> 00:36:39,889
Oh, you don't have to even equip it.

525
00:36:39,889 --> 00:36:42,190
Alright, so how do I stun you?

526
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:45,070
How do you get stunned?

527
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:48,659
Get out of here.

528
00:36:48,659 --> 00:36:50,659
What else? I had to set him up scarecrows

529
00:36:50,659 --> 00:36:53,340
to give him something else to tackle.

530
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,480
Now look at this net that you just found.

531
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,130
Oh, alright.

532
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:02,130
Look at this net that I just found.

533
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:06,349
Okay, I get it.

534
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,590
Hey, how do I catch him?

535
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:13,579
Not on me!

536
00:37:13,579 --> 00:37:16,019
Idiots!

537
00:37:18,019 --> 00:37:23,710
Have you ever tried to catch

538
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,710
a real life superhero?

539
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,340
Have you ever used a disguise?

540
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,510
How do I catch this?

541
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:40,800
He didn't tell me how to like stun him.

542
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,829
I just rammed him to him.

543
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:47,579
Did I not put his head?

544
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:53,329
Hit him.

545
00:37:53,329 --> 00:37:55,760
Wait, it rammed into like a pole.

546
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,510
Oh, that didn't work.

547
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:03,119
Alright, Bunger.

548
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,900
Into the wall. It didn't work.

549
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,420
Ram another Bunger.

550
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,590
Bunger versus Bunger.

551
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:16,820
Bunger.

552
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,440
Sounds like a shitty law firm.

553
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,000
Had Bunger and Bunger.

554
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,260
We take your case dead serious.

555
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:28,980
Alright, hit him.

556
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:35,250
Come over here. PvP time.

557
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:44,130
Go get that. Bunger.

558
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:49,360
Bunger! Bunger!

559
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:55,380
I don't think this is going to work.

560
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:58,320
Over there. Into a tree.

561
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,980
Smash into that tree.

562
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:06,179
Alright, Bunger.

563
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:10,510
Bunger? Okay.

564
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:22,460
Bunger! No!

565
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:32,429
Out of Bunger.

566
00:39:32,429 --> 00:39:34,429
Here you go. I got it just for you, man.

567
00:39:34,429 --> 00:39:40,639
What? You should get a hamburger head.

568
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:42,639
Justice is served.

569
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:45,780
How come when they get

570
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,780
bit down on, they don't go like...

571
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,780
Oh!

572
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,780
Well like...

573
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,780
More realistic that way.

574
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:57,420
Let's get moving right away.

575
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,619
You're a pretty good hunter.

576
00:40:00,619 --> 00:40:02,619
Like Philbo said.

577
00:40:02,619 --> 00:40:04,619
This is a kid's game.

578
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:06,619
Yeah, but I mean...

579
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:10,909
Is it?

580
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,909
It is.

581
00:40:12,909 --> 00:40:15,730
Well, it's an E for everyone.

582
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,730
Is Mario a kid's game?

583
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:19,730
I disagree. I played those cube

584
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:21,730
levels in Mario Sunshine. I disagree.

585
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:32,219
Wait.

586
00:40:32,219 --> 00:40:34,219
Will he get Bungered in the face?

587
00:40:34,219 --> 00:40:38,380
Okay, follow Philbo

588
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:41,199
to Snackburg.

589
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,440
What's a squeeve?

590
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,440
Gold camera.

591
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,809
That thing's worth a lot of money.

592
00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:05,119
Is it like a dweeb? Like you're a dweeb.

593
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:15,250
That's my friend you're talking about.

594
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:17,809
Don't worry. We'll get our revenge.

595
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,809
Slow and meticulous.

596
00:41:19,809 --> 00:41:25,059
What do you know?

597
00:41:25,059 --> 00:41:27,300
Here. Eat this. No!

598
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,659
You don't get any. I'm not giving you any food.

599
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:33,659
I haven't seen a new face in like forever.

600
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:35,659
I'm Bethica Winkle Snoot.

601
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,659
And I know everything about everybody.

602
00:41:37,659 --> 00:41:39,659
It's pretty cool toupee hair.

603
00:41:39,659 --> 00:41:42,289
Uncombed toupee.

604
00:41:42,289 --> 00:41:44,289
Alright, can I help you?

605
00:41:44,289 --> 00:41:46,289
I love your snack scope.

606
00:41:46,289 --> 00:41:48,289
You and me are totes twinsies.

607
00:41:48,289 --> 00:41:50,289
I bet you've seen lots of great stuff.

608
00:41:50,289 --> 00:41:52,289
Let me take a peek at your journal.

609
00:41:52,289 --> 00:41:55,360
No, it's mine.

610
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,360
You lost your journal?

611
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,360
No big deal. You can borrow

612
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,360
one of mine. I keep them in my

613
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,360
cave. Bring it here.

614
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,360
I'll show you how it's done.

615
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,050
Pick up the journal.

616
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:21,550
I got the journal.

617
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:23,550
Are we playing solitaire?

618
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:25,920
Wait. You're playing solitaire

619
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,920
by yourself in your house?

620
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,159
What filbert is the squeep?

621
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:35,659
Wait, you're gonna call somebody like a

622
00:42:35,659 --> 00:42:37,659
squeeb and talk a bunch of shit and you're playing solitaire

623
00:42:37,659 --> 00:42:40,349
on the ground in your house?

624
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:46,559
That's not okay.

625
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:52,190
Let's get a photo of this. She's projecting.

626
00:42:52,190 --> 00:43:03,579
Hi, I've got the

627
00:43:03,579 --> 00:43:05,579
diary and whatever it is.

628
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:10,380
You're a belly?

629
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,750
Oh, it tells you what you've caught so far.

630
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,750
This is cool. This is your Bugapedia.

631
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,750
You can scroll

632
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:18,750
through all the bug stacks you've scanned

633
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,750
with your snack scope.

634
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,750
You can also check on their likes, dislikes,

635
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:24,750
and hints on how to catch them.

636
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:27,570
Now check out the other pages to see what

637
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:30,059
they're all about. Loves

638
00:43:30,059 --> 00:43:32,239
beating human hearts and

639
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:34,239
is afraid of bumper bug.

640
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:39,789
Ooh, what's this?

641
00:43:39,789 --> 00:43:41,789
Loves apple juice.

642
00:43:41,789 --> 00:43:43,789
Loves, that's like tequila.

643
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:45,969
Whatever that is. 4900

644
00:43:45,969 --> 00:43:47,969
calories. Why are these so many calories?

645
00:43:47,969 --> 00:43:50,269
30,000

646
00:43:50,269 --> 00:43:54,500
calories? You'd be shitting

647
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:59,420
for days. 36,000

648
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,420
calories. The human body

649
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,420
doesn't even have like 2,000 calories.

650
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:06,110
You take in 2,000 calories

651
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,110
a day. That's like your total calorie count in your

652
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:12,079
body. What is this?

653
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:15,280
This is your grumpedia. It's like a

654
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,280
Bugapedia but for grumpises.

655
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,159
This blank space will fill up with your notes

656
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:22,159
once you get to know each grumpis better.

657
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:26,059
The self-appointed mayor, he seems to be

658
00:44:26,059 --> 00:44:28,059
trying his best. Right, he loves

659
00:44:28,059 --> 00:44:31,710
this person.

660
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,710
He hates you. Why do you hate her?

661
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:35,710
Who do you hate?

662
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:38,510
You hate everybody.

663
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:40,510
A sharp-tongued socialite snoop,

664
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:42,510
my bestie apparently, likes gossip,

665
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:44,510
photography, and breaking and entering.

666
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:50,030
Why do you hate him

667
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:52,849
so much? Have I met

668
00:44:52,849 --> 00:44:54,849
this person? Oh, Lizbert. Okay.

669
00:44:54,849 --> 00:44:58,429
This is your clues page. It's where you'll keep

670
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:00,429
all your progress in finding Lizbert. I don't give

671
00:45:00,429 --> 00:45:02,429
a shit about that. I want to get interesting

672
00:45:02,429 --> 00:45:05,440
bugs. There's clues here.

673
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,809
A report on Lizbert's

674
00:45:07,809 --> 00:45:11,519
discovery of bug snacks.

675
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:14,079
What's this? This is your quest list.

676
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,079
You can get in-depth info on all

677
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,449
your ongoing quests. You can also

678
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:20,449
pin a quest to keep it visible while you're walking

679
00:45:20,449 --> 00:45:22,449
around.

680
00:45:22,449 --> 00:45:26,099
This is your snack pack. It's where you

681
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:28,269
keep the bug snacks you've caught.

682
00:45:28,269 --> 00:45:32,050
This is your map of Snark-

683
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:34,050
Snarktooth. It's a map.

684
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:37,440
This is your list of

685
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,440
tools. Just a way to keep

686
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,440
track of all your snack-catching gear.

687
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:48,159
You thought it was gonna be another one.

688
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:51,300
Oh, alright. Now what?

689
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:54,940
Everything you scan with the

690
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:56,940
snack scope winds up in the journal.

691
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:58,940
I have more for you to do,

692
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,940
but Wambus is scaring all the snacks

693
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,940
away. You'll have to come back

694
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:04,940
later. Until then,

695
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,940
you should get Bilbo out of here.

696
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:11,789
Okay. Bilbo!

697
00:46:11,789 --> 00:46:13,789
I'm ready to follow you.

698
00:46:13,789 --> 00:46:15,789
Let's get this over with, buddy.

699
00:46:15,789 --> 00:46:22,130
Ding! Crit sound.

700
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:35,679
Why was he bent over like that?

701
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:37,679
How come there was never a

702
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:39,679
slingshot added to TF2? Don't you feel like

703
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:41,679
that could be like a scout primary that they just

704
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:46,159
didn't capitalize on?

705
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,659
Not primary.

706
00:46:58,659 --> 00:47:01,599
I think it could work.

707
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:06,030
That's the huntsman. No, no, no, no, different.

708
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:13,070
Different. Alright, so do

709
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:15,070
we live in Snackburg?

710
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:17,070
When do the side effects of eating those bug drugs

711
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:19,070
wear off? Cause he still has those

712
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:21,380
body parts. Does it ever wear off?

713
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,380
Or is that just who you are now?

714
00:47:42,849 --> 00:47:44,849
Why don't I interview you?

715
00:47:53,019 --> 00:47:57,760
This is where I say

716
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,760
here we go, we're recording.

717
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,760
I turn it off, and we just have a little conversation

718
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,760
and I say yeah, maybe I'll

719
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:08,500
use that somewhere.

720
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,500
Uh, hey, who are you?

721
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,480
Big quotes.

722
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:25,539
Deputy Mayor.

723
00:48:25,539 --> 00:48:27,539
What else? Why did you come to Snack through the Island?

724
00:48:35,139 --> 00:48:37,139
Simon Cowell? What?

725
00:48:37,139 --> 00:48:39,139
Hey, how do you feel about bug

726
00:48:39,139 --> 00:48:41,139
snacks?

727
00:48:41,139 --> 00:48:43,139
Great. I mean, they taste good

728
00:48:43,139 --> 00:48:45,139
and they make everybody happy

729
00:48:45,139 --> 00:48:47,139
so what's not to love?

730
00:48:47,139 --> 00:48:50,139
Until you come down.

731
00:48:50,139 --> 00:48:57,619
What do you think about that?

732
00:48:57,619 --> 00:48:59,619
Lizbert and me go way back. Lizbert was

733
00:48:59,619 --> 00:49:01,619
is awesome.

734
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:03,619
She always knew what

735
00:49:03,619 --> 00:49:05,920
to do and she brought out the best

736
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,920
in all of us.

737
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,920
Ooh, Mitch McConnell. Oh, what?

738
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,920
Why? Does that make any sense

739
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,139
right now? Okay.

740
00:49:16,139 --> 00:49:18,139
So that's how you became mayor?

741
00:49:18,139 --> 00:49:23,010
You're a deadly side effect.

742
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,500
His eyes are like all purple

743
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:32,050
and red.

744
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:48,980
Okay, why didn't it last long?

745
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:56,980
Isn't that how the dinosaurs died?

746
00:50:01,969 --> 00:50:05,039
I think we're done.

747
00:50:14,989 --> 00:50:16,989
I feel like that thing's gonna pop off and shoot me in the face.

748
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,920
Okay.

749
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,940
Okay.

750
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:01,179
Alright.

751
00:51:03,869 --> 00:51:06,429
I just turned his leg into

752
00:51:06,429 --> 00:51:09,309
a piece of meat.

753
00:51:09,309 --> 00:51:11,309
This is just fucking terrible

754
00:51:11,309 --> 00:51:13,309
experiments I'm doing to these people.

755
00:51:13,309 --> 00:51:18,880
Okay, we're gonna find Grimble

756
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,880
or go back to Becca.

757
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,059
No, Becca sucks.

758
00:51:23,059 --> 00:51:25,059
I want Grimble.

759
00:51:25,059 --> 00:51:28,190
Let's remove one of those letters.

760
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:30,190
Big fan.

761
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:35,739
This is locked.

762
00:51:35,739 --> 00:51:37,739
All this stuff is locked. How do I break into people's things?

763
00:51:37,739 --> 00:51:43,699
Stop right there!

764
00:51:43,699 --> 00:51:47,090
You violated the law!

765
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:57,519
I go to the beach?

766
00:51:57,519 --> 00:51:59,519
That's not the beach.

767
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:07,179
Is it? You didn't say criminal scum.

768
00:52:07,179 --> 00:52:09,179
Minus two. Yeah, I'm just trying to keep you on your toes.

769
00:52:09,179 --> 00:52:12,000
Alright, is this Grimble?

770
00:52:23,699 --> 00:52:25,699
You're not Grimble.

771
00:52:25,699 --> 00:52:27,699
Who are you?

772
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:40,260
What's that dog

773
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:42,260
with the big teeth that does that?

774
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:47,309
Who is Eggabelle?

775
00:52:53,309 --> 00:52:55,619
Bulldog, yes.

776
00:53:11,619 --> 00:53:13,619
I understand the internal mechanism behind

777
00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:15,619
the molecular dissemination of snack

778
00:53:15,619 --> 00:53:17,619
particles.

779
00:53:17,619 --> 00:53:20,820
This is the Snack-tivator.

780
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:22,820
Info-ification.

781
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:24,820
What?

782
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:26,820
Foot turns into

783
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:28,820
Strabby. Understand?

784
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:30,820
Why did you...

785
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:32,820
Look at these arms.

786
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:35,420
Don't say...

787
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,420
What am I supposed to do?

788
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,420
Left foot? What I can choose?

789
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,420
What kind of weird experiments to do?

790
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:44,880
I don't even know what that is.

791
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:51,250
I don't know what that is.

792
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:53,250
I just read things. I'm a reader.

793
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:56,190
Where did you go? Where did you just go?

794
00:53:58,619 --> 00:54:02,059
Oh, this is chocolate.

795
00:54:02,059 --> 00:54:08,269
You have more than one kind of sauce.

796
00:54:08,269 --> 00:54:11,469
What's that thing? It's a longnose.

797
00:54:11,469 --> 00:54:13,840
A quibble. It follows things that it

798
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,840
likes. And it nudges them with

799
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:18,719
its spoon.

800
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:21,730
Let's take it.

801
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:45,139
Got it.

802
00:54:45,139 --> 00:54:47,440
You have more than one kind of sauce.

803
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,440
Select your sauce slinger and then

804
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,260
select the sauce you want.

805
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:55,949
Chocolate sauce.

806
00:54:55,949 --> 00:54:57,949
What does that weird lady want me to do?

807
00:54:57,949 --> 00:55:00,320
I'm going to do something.

808
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,320
Look at all these...

809
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,559
strawberries.

810
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:12,559
There's a lot of strawberries here.

811
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:16,019
Scan. I already scanned the strawberries.

812
00:55:16,019 --> 00:55:18,019
There's a floating macarito.

813
00:55:18,019 --> 00:55:26,449
Oh, shit. Catch it.

814
00:55:26,449 --> 00:55:28,449
This is their nest. I'll get like ten here.

815
00:55:28,449 --> 00:55:37,969
Oh, crab.

816
00:55:37,969 --> 00:55:40,340
It's a crapple.

817
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:42,340
This curious snack likes to dig things out

818
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:44,340
of the sand and bring them to its lair.

819
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:47,219
Oh, it's an apple crab.

820
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:52,380
Okay, so

821
00:55:52,380 --> 00:56:00,320
can I catch you with this?

822
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,320
Get the crab? I mean, I'm going to try.

823
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:07,250
Maybe I have to net him.

824
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:12,110
I kind of want one of the dancing margaritas.

825
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:14,110
Seashell. No, no, no, no.

826
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:23,820
Wait. Get in there.

827
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:28,050
Does it like chocolate? Who likes chocolate?

828
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:37,380
Anybody like chocolate?

829
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:42,239
He loves chocolate. Hey, put that down.

830
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:46,780
Wait. Okay. I can get him.

831
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:48,780
Chocolate and then

832
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:56,260
crapple. You pick up seashells?

833
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:58,260
Oh, wait. I can. What can I do with

834
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:02,929
the seashell? All right. Get the

835
00:57:02,929 --> 00:57:07,280
wevo.

836
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,860
Can I have six? She sells

837
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:12,860
seashells by the seashore. She sells

838
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:14,860
seashells by the seashore. She sells

839
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:16,860
seashells by the seashore. She sells

840
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:18,860
seashells by the seashore. She sells seashells

841
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:22,059
by the seashore. Almost.

842
00:57:22,059 --> 00:57:24,559
Sometimes I can get it. What's that?

843
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:26,800
Put a ball in there.

844
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:34,739
Find grahamble on the beach.

845
00:57:34,739 --> 00:57:37,809
Wait, wait, wait. There we go.

846
00:57:37,809 --> 00:57:39,809
A snackery leaps in and out of the ocean

847
00:57:39,809 --> 00:57:41,809
and needs to be caught in mid-leap. I don't

848
00:57:41,809 --> 00:57:43,809
have a way to get that.

849
00:57:43,809 --> 00:57:46,369
Wait. Can I like frisbee this

850
00:57:46,369 --> 00:57:50,019
and hit it in the head? I probably can.

851
00:57:50,019 --> 00:58:09,780
Damn it. All right.

852
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:14,380
Where's grahamble by the beach?

853
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:17,010
Wait. Do you like

854
00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:20,340
chocolate? What's that thing?

855
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:22,340
It's a pineatella

856
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:24,340
that burrows into the sand to

857
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:26,340
hide. Perhaps another bug snack could dig

858
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:28,579
it out. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait,

859
00:58:28,579 --> 00:58:30,579
wait. Okay. So the crab digs that out and I can

860
00:58:30,579 --> 00:58:34,269
catch them both. No.

861
00:58:34,269 --> 00:58:38,820
What do you like? Loves

862
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:40,989
chocolate. Okay.

863
00:58:40,989 --> 00:58:42,989
Here we go. I'm going to use you for

864
00:58:42,989 --> 00:58:45,230
my own benefit. I'm going to coat

865
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:51,699
this with chocolate. No. Get away.

866
00:58:51,699 --> 00:58:57,570
Get away.

867
00:58:57,570 --> 00:59:04,800
Dig him out. Dig him out.

868
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:09,780
No. No.

869
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,780
All right. Well, whatever. I got you.

870
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:14,340
Oh, and my inventory's

871
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:16,340
full. Can I eat them myself?

872
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:18,699
Shit. I got to feed somebody. What do I do with

873
00:59:18,699 --> 00:59:20,699
the bugs? What do I do with them?

874
00:59:20,699 --> 00:59:33,039
Can I eat them? You have to find

875
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:37,389
grahamble. Find grahamble near

876
00:59:37,389 --> 00:59:40,340
the beach. Who the fuck is

877
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:48,590
this person? Near the

878
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:50,590
founder. There's grahamble

879
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:52,590
and then there's somebody else.

880
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:55,469
Wiggle. This is KK

881
00:59:55,469 --> 00:59:58,030
Slider. I can't wait for like the

882
00:59:58,030 --> 01:00:17,170
quack, quack, quack, quack.

883
01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:22,219
I'm sorry to interrupt,

884
01:00:22,219 --> 01:00:28,559
but...

885
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:33,309
You're going to eat those?

886
01:00:33,309 --> 01:00:35,309
Inspiration

887
01:00:35,309 --> 01:00:37,309
is so hard to find.

888
01:00:37,309 --> 01:00:39,550
I just have to sing

889
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:41,550
wherever it strikes me.

890
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:43,550
I feel that way too. I like this character.

891
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:45,550
Maybe it could strike you

892
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:48,929
over there. Oh, I'd hate

893
01:00:48,929 --> 01:00:50,929
to go alone.

894
01:00:50,929 --> 01:00:53,230
Won't you join me for a

895
01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:55,230
long walk on the beach?

896
01:00:55,230 --> 01:00:58,050
Like date?

897
01:00:58,050 --> 01:01:00,050
Of course, darling.

898
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:02,050
It would just be you,

899
01:01:02,050 --> 01:01:04,050
me, and

900
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:06,050
your delectable Strabby.

901
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:08,050
Singing the night away until

902
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:10,050
we drift off to sleep.

903
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:12,050
SpongeBob and Mrs. Puff.

904
01:01:12,050 --> 01:01:14,219
Sorry.

905
01:01:14,219 --> 01:01:16,219
Every time I go to sleep... Like artist depiction of

906
01:01:16,219 --> 01:01:18,219
a new...

907
01:01:18,219 --> 01:01:20,400
So no to all that.

908
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,400
But the date's still a maybe.

909
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,639
Very well.

910
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:26,940
I will go and

911
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:28,940
take my inspiration

912
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:32,849
home.

913
01:01:32,849 --> 01:01:35,469
Mmm...

914
01:01:35,469 --> 01:01:37,469
Tom, my dear.

915
01:01:37,469 --> 01:01:39,469
Calm down, little ones.

916
01:01:39,469 --> 01:01:41,469
Wiggle means well.

917
01:01:41,469 --> 01:01:43,469
She just don't understand what I do.

918
01:01:56,079 --> 01:02:02,420
Who are you?

919
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:04,420
You best turn back. These little ones

920
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:07,039
are my kin.

921
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:09,039
Well, that's a relief.

922
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:11,039
Sorry I'm short with that.

923
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:15,039
I'm Graham Wiggle. I'm an aspiring

924
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:18,429
Bugsnax breeder. Not too keen

925
01:02:18,429 --> 01:02:20,429
on going to town, but I'm running

926
01:02:20,429 --> 01:02:24,190
out of room back to my barn.

927
01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:26,190
Trouble is, some of my snacks went

928
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:28,190
missing. I'm not going back

929
01:02:28,190 --> 01:02:30,190
till they're all home. If you want

930
01:02:30,190 --> 01:02:32,190
to help me, then I got a friend

931
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:34,190
to introduce you to. Follow me!

932
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:36,190
Bugsnax. Make him eat one.

933
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:54,610
Oh, shit. I can't

934
01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:56,610
carry anymore.

935
01:02:56,610 --> 01:02:58,610
See that, Strabby? That there's

936
01:02:58,610 --> 01:03:00,849
Sprout. I've been training him to follow my

937
01:03:00,849 --> 01:03:03,840
pointer in his buggy ball. Monkey ball!

938
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,840
We were in the middle of training. See if you can

939
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:07,840
guide Sprout back here to us.

940
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:10,460
Have a ball. Alright. Guide the

941
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:12,460
buggy ball through the course.

942
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:14,460
You got the buggy ball. Switch to it with

943
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:17,280
Q. Buggy ball?

944
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:22,079
Guide it. This is so cool.

945
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:28,929
Keep going. You can do it.

946
01:03:28,929 --> 01:03:31,869
You can do it. Oh, that's

947
01:03:31,869 --> 01:03:33,869
the worst part of the Wario level in

948
01:03:33,869 --> 01:03:35,869
the N64 Wario Kart. I know.

949
01:03:35,869 --> 01:03:37,869
Nice work, though. Keep going.

950
01:03:37,869 --> 01:03:41,329
Nice. Keep going. You're almost there.

951
01:03:41,329 --> 01:03:44,780
Up there.

952
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:47,539
You did it. Come on. Yes.

953
01:03:47,539 --> 01:03:51,760
Bug, I did it.

954
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,400
Peel bugs.

955
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,400
Eat him. Wait, and pick up

956
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,699
this guy and eat him?

957
01:04:18,699 --> 01:04:22,030
But I have...

958
01:04:22,030 --> 01:04:24,030
I have too much stuff in my inventory.

959
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:26,530
Do I have a storage unit or

960
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:28,530
something? How do I...

961
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:31,730
How would I...

962
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:34,030
Wow. I want that one.

963
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:36,030
Release them. Release them. No.

964
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:44,349
They're mine. Feed the dude in

965
01:04:44,349 --> 01:04:51,380
town.

966
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:53,380
Alright, I'll release...

967
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:55,380
Okay. I will release

968
01:04:55,380 --> 01:05:04,400
one of each. We're doing it

969
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,400
fair. I'm picking them at random.

970
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:15,219
There. Okay, now I need to get

971
01:05:15,219 --> 01:05:17,219
three of these guys as his peel bugs.

972
01:05:17,219 --> 01:05:19,219
He said that this is randomly... They're in holes

973
01:05:19,219 --> 01:05:24,340
on the beach. Holes on the beach.

974
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:29,199
Peel bug.

975
01:05:29,199 --> 01:05:32,139
You eat them. I don't know how.

976
01:05:32,139 --> 01:05:34,699
I didn't learn how to do that.

977
01:05:34,699 --> 01:05:37,260
Is that a peel bug? No.

978
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:41,809
That's a pinata.

979
01:05:41,809 --> 01:05:50,130
Holes on the ground.

980
01:05:50,130 --> 01:05:52,130
Gigantic bits. Oh, shit.

981
01:05:52,130 --> 01:05:54,130
Gigantic bits did come in. And also,

982
01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:56,369
let's start with

983
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:58,369
Red Lemonade gave five community subs,

984
01:05:58,369 --> 01:06:00,739
but they were Tier 2.

985
01:06:00,739 --> 01:06:02,739
That's Tier 2 community subs from Red Lemonade.

986
01:06:02,739 --> 01:06:04,739
That's nuts.

987
01:06:04,739 --> 01:06:06,739
Thank you for those. And then

988
01:06:06,739 --> 01:06:08,739
ten thousand bits.

989
01:06:08,739 --> 01:06:10,739
A hundred bucks in bits from

990
01:06:10,739 --> 01:06:12,739
I'm...

991
01:06:12,739 --> 01:06:15,420
I'm Omo89.

992
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:18,619
Thank you, Omo. Thanks for the hundred fucking dollars.

993
01:06:18,619 --> 01:06:22,980
Jeremy, thanks for all the constant entertainment

994
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:24,980
throughout all these years. It's impossible to quantify

995
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:26,980
how much happiness you've provided.

996
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:28,980
So consider this a small token of my appreciation.

997
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:33,519
I...

998
01:06:33,519 --> 01:06:35,519
You're never under any obligation to give me

999
01:06:35,519 --> 01:06:39,230
a cent. So

1000
01:06:39,230 --> 01:06:44,159
you just hanging out here is enough for me.

1001
01:06:44,159 --> 01:06:46,159
Thank you nonetheless and happy to have you.

1002
01:06:46,159 --> 01:06:50,579
Now let's kill some bugs.

1003
01:06:50,579 --> 01:06:55,059
Thanks for the hundred bucks.

1004
01:06:55,059 --> 01:07:02,989
That's a lot of money. I don't see any holes on the

1005
01:07:02,989 --> 01:07:05,230
beach, do you? Wait.

1006
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:07,230
Like, is that a peel bug?

1007
01:07:07,230 --> 01:07:10,369
Catch lost peal...

1008
01:07:10,369 --> 01:07:12,369
It's definitely there. It's like the basketball bug.

1009
01:07:12,369 --> 01:07:15,949
That's a peel bug. It rolls up

1010
01:07:15,949 --> 01:07:17,949
and hides inside holes or logs. They'll have to

1011
01:07:17,949 --> 01:07:19,949
be pushed out somehow. Oh, I know

1012
01:07:19,949 --> 01:07:23,280
what to do. Wait.

1013
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:28,460
Oh, shit. All right. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait,

1014
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:31,469
wait, wait. All right. Push him out.

1015
01:07:31,469 --> 01:07:40,420
Come here. Oh, wait.

1016
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:42,420
Is there a way I can quickly activate this

1017
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:45,940
instead of switching? Or do I have

1018
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:48,179
to switch to it? All right. This one.

1019
01:07:48,179 --> 01:07:55,469
Get away from me.

1020
01:07:55,469 --> 01:08:00,269
For another peel bug. I like the orange peel bugs.

1021
01:08:00,269 --> 01:08:07,500
They look delicious.

1022
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,500
Is there a peel bug in there? Nope. Just a squidward.

1023
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:13,730
Number keys are tools.

1024
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:17,760
Oh, okay. Come on over here.

1025
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:27,170
I need you. Come here.

1026
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:35,149
Two. Come on over here.

1027
01:08:35,149 --> 01:08:40,340
Outside of memes, how is...

1028
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:42,340
How good is this game?

1029
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:44,510
It's kind of good.

1030
01:08:44,510 --> 01:08:46,510
It's just relaxing and

1031
01:08:46,510 --> 01:08:49,010
fun. This is a chill game.

1032
01:08:49,010 --> 01:08:55,149
I like it. What about Elden Ring?

1033
01:08:55,149 --> 01:08:58,029
What about Elden Ring?

1034
01:08:58,029 --> 01:09:00,850
I haven't played... I'm not

1035
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:04,750
currently playing Elden Ring. Come on.

1036
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:09,039
I need one more. True. True.

1037
01:09:09,039 --> 01:09:16,399
True. What do you mean true?

1038
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:18,640
Do I have to reload the area? I don't see

1039
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:27,149
any more orange bugs. Where are they?

1040
01:09:27,149 --> 01:09:35,390
Hello? You only needed

1041
01:09:35,390 --> 01:09:43,520
two? No, I need one more.

1042
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,520
Look around more, you dingus.

1043
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:48,270
I'm, you know, on the beach. What are you talking about?

1044
01:09:48,270 --> 01:10:01,380
Clefairy.

1045
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:03,380
Every time I say a mean comment, I'm going to do

1046
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:09,460
Clefairy. In here?

1047
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:14,819
There's definitely one in here. Fuck off.

1048
01:10:14,819 --> 01:10:16,819
Oh, yeah? Clefairy. How does

1049
01:10:16,819 --> 01:10:18,819
that sound? Oh, another one. Clefairy.

1050
01:10:18,819 --> 01:10:20,989
Oh, another one. I know. You call me

1051
01:10:20,989 --> 01:10:22,989
a dickhead? Clefairy.

1052
01:10:22,989 --> 01:10:33,340
I can go all day, man.

1053
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:36,029
Elemo Cleary. I've got

1054
01:10:36,029 --> 01:10:40,960
your snacks. You got my

1055
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:42,960
snacks. I have the embodiment of the Stinky

1056
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,960
Cheese emote. No.

1057
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:46,960
What? How? Explain.

1058
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:49,649
Why do I get that

1059
01:10:49,649 --> 01:10:51,649
but I don't get it?

1060
01:10:51,649 --> 01:10:53,649
Get out of here. That's bullshit.

1061
01:10:59,649 --> 01:11:01,649
I thought this guy didn't like eating these things.

1062
01:11:01,649 --> 01:11:04,529
Sauce

1063
01:11:04,529 --> 01:11:06,529
Buggy Ball with Chocolate lead to

1064
01:11:06,529 --> 01:11:08,529
quibbles to grumble without trapping them.

1065
01:11:08,529 --> 01:11:10,960
That's fun.

1066
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:13,500
All right. Come on.

1067
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:19,010
Come on, quibble.

1068
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:22,640
Get over here. Chocolate.

1069
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:31,649
All right. Come get it.

1070
01:11:31,649 --> 01:11:36,000
Where are the quibbles?

1071
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,029
Quibble. He loves it.

1072
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:42,340
Bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon.

1073
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:44,340
It's bacon.

1074
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:48,109
It's bacon.

1075
01:11:48,109 --> 01:11:51,380
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

1076
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:55,729
Bacon, bacon, bacon.

1077
01:11:55,729 --> 01:11:57,729
Dogs don't know it's not bacon. It's

1078
01:11:57,729 --> 01:12:02,590
bacon. Get in there.

1079
01:12:02,590 --> 01:12:05,859
I used to

1080
01:12:05,859 --> 01:12:07,859
love that commercial when I was younger.

1081
01:12:07,859 --> 01:12:09,859
I thought it was the funniest goddamn thing in the world.

1082
01:12:09,859 --> 01:12:12,670
It was like the GoPro

1083
01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:14,670
POV of the dog nose running around going

1084
01:12:14,670 --> 01:12:16,850
bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon.

1085
01:12:16,850 --> 01:12:23,949
It's such a great commercial.

1086
01:12:23,949 --> 01:12:28,500
Began Strips. Yeah.

1087
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:31,550
Show it? Hold on.

1088
01:12:31,550 --> 01:12:33,550
Dogs don't know

1089
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:35,550
it's not bacon. It's bacon.

1090
01:12:35,550 --> 01:12:38,369
Began Strips

1091
01:12:38,369 --> 01:12:48,350
commercial.

1092
01:12:48,350 --> 01:12:53,659
What's the right one?

1093
01:12:53,659 --> 01:12:59,039
It's definitely this one.

1094
01:12:59,039 --> 01:13:26,029
Bacon.

1095
01:13:26,029 --> 01:13:28,029
Here you go. It's Began Strips.

1096
01:13:28,029 --> 01:13:30,029
Brand dog snack from Purina.

1097
01:13:30,029 --> 01:13:32,029
Began Strips. Dogs don't know it's not bacon.

1098
01:13:32,029 --> 01:13:34,029
It's bacon.

1099
01:13:34,029 --> 01:13:36,029
Wait.

1100
01:13:36,029 --> 01:13:38,029
There's a 20. They redid it.

1101
01:13:38,029 --> 01:13:40,029
All right. We're going to see if the remake is any better.

1102
01:13:40,029 --> 01:13:45,729
Hold on. Let's see if the remake is any better.

1103
01:13:53,329 --> 01:14:01,970
Nope. Not as good.

1104
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:04,340
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum. It's done.

1105
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:09,010
No, not even close.

1106
01:14:09,010 --> 01:14:11,010
No, no, no, no. I'm sorry.

1107
01:14:11,010 --> 01:14:13,250
I'm sorry. Wait, there's another one?

1108
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:27,149
No, it's not as good.

1109
01:14:27,149 --> 01:14:29,149
No, it's not as good.

1110
01:14:29,149 --> 01:14:31,899
Is there another one?

1111
01:14:31,899 --> 01:14:33,899
Where's the original one? No, fuck these new ones.

1112
01:14:33,899 --> 01:14:35,899
I want the old voice.

1113
01:14:35,899 --> 01:14:44,220
Do it.

1114
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:49,970
What the hell? It's frozen.

1115
01:14:49,970 --> 01:14:57,199
There we go. Okay.

1116
01:14:57,199 --> 01:14:59,199
Let's compare the voices. It's much better.

1117
01:15:14,739 --> 01:15:16,739
It's bacon.

1118
01:15:16,739 --> 01:15:20,899
There you go.

1119
01:15:20,899 --> 01:15:22,899
No, it's Began Strips. Brand dog snack from Purina.

1120
01:15:22,899 --> 01:15:24,899
Began Strips.

1121
01:15:24,899 --> 01:15:26,899
Dogs don't know it's not bacon.

1122
01:15:26,899 --> 01:15:28,899
It's bacon.

1123
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:34,979
It's way better.

1124
01:15:34,979 --> 01:15:40,029
Is it John Madden?

1125
01:15:40,029 --> 01:15:42,029
It actually does sound like John Madden.

1126
01:15:42,029 --> 01:15:46,000
What if it was him?

1127
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:54,260
It's John Madden. Get away from my ball.

1128
01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:56,260
That's not for you.

1129
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:58,260
That's for the other dogs.

1130
01:15:58,260 --> 01:16:00,260
All right. Where, where, where, where, where?

1131
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:02,260
I need another nose guy.

1132
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:07,500
Excuse me.

1133
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,939
Excuse me.

1134
01:16:09,939 --> 01:16:11,939
I can't whistles. You know the one that goes

1135
01:16:11,939 --> 01:16:15,390
I can't do it.

1136
01:16:15,390 --> 01:16:17,390
But like, you know exactly what I'm trying to do.

1137
01:16:17,390 --> 01:16:19,819
Like that.

1138
01:16:19,819 --> 01:16:23,020
Come here.

1139
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:25,020
There you are.

1140
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:27,020
Like what I got. A tasty snack.

1141
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:34,430
Let me go first.

1142
01:16:34,430 --> 01:16:36,430
I gotta have that bacon. Bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon.

1143
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:38,430
Smoky bacon.

1144
01:16:38,430 --> 01:16:50,210
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

1145
01:16:50,210 --> 01:16:56,420
Doesn't it stink? You love things that stink.

1146
01:16:56,420 --> 01:16:58,420
Go in there.

1147
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:00,420
Ashley, you're back.

1148
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:02,420
Don't you ever leave me again.

1149
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:05,100
All right.

1150
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:07,100
Where's my money?

1151
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:09,659
You did it.

1152
01:17:09,659 --> 01:17:11,659
My kin are all together again.

1153
01:17:11,659 --> 01:17:13,659
I'm so happy I could cry.

1154
01:17:13,659 --> 01:17:15,659
Here goes.

1155
01:17:17,659 --> 01:17:22,659
Ew.

1156
01:17:22,659 --> 01:17:24,659
I'm ready to head back to the ranch.

1157
01:17:24,659 --> 01:17:26,659
Thanks for all your help.

1158
01:17:26,659 --> 01:17:28,659
Sprout.

1159
01:17:28,659 --> 01:17:30,659
Is this the ball?

1160
01:17:38,189 --> 01:17:40,189
It's really loud now because I turned it up.

1161
01:17:40,189 --> 01:17:42,560
Yeah, we're good now.

1162
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:45,680
A little bit lower. We're good.

1163
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:49,680
Is there oxygen in there?

1164
01:18:03,489 --> 01:18:05,979
Okay.

1165
01:18:05,979 --> 01:18:07,979
Go see what Befika wants.

1166
01:18:07,979 --> 01:18:11,250
Look at this.

1167
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:13,550
Cool.

1168
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:17,260
Look at this little happy family.

1169
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:25,840
All right. We'll go talk to Befika.

1170
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:32,689
Throw the sprout in the ocean and never come back.

1171
01:18:42,979 --> 01:18:44,979
This guy here.

1172
01:18:44,979 --> 01:18:50,460
That guy. There he is.

1173
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:52,460
That's the one.

1174
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:54,460
I'm going good.

1175
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:56,460
And I've got something for you.

1176
01:18:56,460 --> 01:18:58,460
I've got a crab apple

1177
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:00,460
for you. You're going to love it.

1178
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:05,899
Oh, wow. That looks uncomfortable.

1179
01:19:05,899 --> 01:19:11,409
Hey, come here.

1180
01:19:11,409 --> 01:19:13,409
Let's make you even more of a monster.

1181
01:19:13,409 --> 01:19:26,380
We have huge teeth.

1182
01:19:26,380 --> 01:19:28,380
So is this like the way to show your wealth

1183
01:19:28,380 --> 01:19:31,010
in this society?

1184
01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:33,010
There's a guy with a bunch of fruits all over him

1185
01:19:33,010 --> 01:19:35,010
and vegetable noses and stuff.

1186
01:19:35,010 --> 01:19:37,010
Is that kind of like the top hat of this society?

1187
01:19:37,010 --> 01:19:39,949
The people that are walking around

1188
01:19:39,949 --> 01:19:41,949
with just regular clothes and no fruits.

1189
01:19:41,949 --> 01:19:44,189
They're like lower on society.

1190
01:19:50,270 --> 01:19:57,380
Wait.

1191
01:19:57,380 --> 01:19:59,380
We've got some drama.

1192
01:20:02,510 --> 01:20:05,140
You made that man an elite.

1193
01:20:09,140 --> 01:20:11,140
Not really.

1194
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:13,140
I had that guy win

1195
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:15,140
a car on a game show.

1196
01:20:15,140 --> 01:20:17,140
But he didn't realize

1197
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:19,140
that you have to pay taxes on the car.

1198
01:20:22,659 --> 01:20:24,659
Don't ever take the car

1199
01:20:24,659 --> 01:20:26,659
on a game show if you're ever on one.

1200
01:20:26,659 --> 01:20:30,689
Take the money.

1201
01:20:30,689 --> 01:20:32,689
You guys have a problem. What is it?

1202
01:20:32,689 --> 01:20:35,819
Let's interview this guy.

1203
01:20:45,039 --> 01:20:47,039
Who are you?

1204
01:20:49,409 --> 01:20:51,409
Why did you come to Snark Tooth Island?

1205
01:20:53,409 --> 01:20:55,409
Why did you not do a farm back home?

1206
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:04,260
I didn't take the house on the game show

1207
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:06,260
like you did.

1208
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:12,590
Thoughts on bug snacks?

1209
01:21:15,539 --> 01:21:18,800
What's so confusing about them?

1210
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:25,420
It's Arthur Morgan.

1211
01:21:33,659 --> 01:21:35,659
Well eat them raw or

1212
01:21:35,659 --> 01:21:37,659
that's the really nice way to say eat them alive.

1213
01:21:49,890 --> 01:21:51,890
So we would have been fine on

1214
01:21:51,890 --> 01:21:53,890
bug snacks if it weren't for Gramble.

1215
01:21:57,890 --> 01:21:59,890
That weepy little

1216
01:21:59,890 --> 01:22:01,890
rancher thinks all

1217
01:22:01,890 --> 01:22:03,890
bug snacks are his pets.

1218
01:22:35,090 --> 01:22:37,090
That's good.

1219
01:22:37,090 --> 01:22:39,090
Thank god that's not recorded.

1220
01:22:39,090 --> 01:22:41,090
We're good.

1221
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:47,460
Thank god.

1222
01:22:50,020 --> 01:22:54,180
I'm so happy

1223
01:22:54,180 --> 01:22:56,180
that it didn't get recorded.

1224
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:02,180
What did you do?

1225
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:06,180
You must know.

1226
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:08,180
After that sound happened

1227
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:10,180
I waited about like a half a second

1228
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:17,409
and I went

1229
01:23:17,409 --> 01:23:19,409
It was disgusting.

1230
01:23:33,260 --> 01:23:35,260
Worse?

1231
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:37,260
Well that's why I'm glad it didn't get picked up.

1232
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:39,260
It's fun to talk about it

1233
01:23:39,260 --> 01:23:41,569
but it's not fun to live it.

1234
01:23:41,569 --> 01:23:43,569
Okay

1235
01:23:43,569 --> 01:23:46,449
snooze boring.

1236
01:23:46,449 --> 01:23:48,449
Thanks for your time.

1237
01:23:58,619 --> 01:24:02,140
What is this?

1238
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:05,470
Wambus gave you notes about

1239
01:24:05,470 --> 01:24:07,470
a strange device.

1240
01:24:07,470 --> 01:24:10,479
Strange device

1241
01:24:10,479 --> 01:24:12,479
now we're getting intriguing.

1242
01:24:12,479 --> 01:24:15,039
What the heck?

1243
01:24:15,039 --> 01:24:20,340
What is this?

1244
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:22,640
Let me see.

1245
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:25,140
An activator.

1246
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:29,149
I have this?

1247
01:24:29,149 --> 01:24:31,579
Where is it?

1248
01:24:31,579 --> 01:24:33,579
Okay.

1249
01:24:33,579 --> 01:24:35,579
The door is attached to some ancient mechanisms.

1250
01:24:35,579 --> 01:24:37,579
It looks like

1251
01:24:37,579 --> 01:24:39,579
it might take at least three grumpuses

1252
01:24:39,579 --> 01:24:42,140
to activate these.

1253
01:24:42,140 --> 01:24:46,819
Okay.

1254
01:24:46,819 --> 01:24:49,760
You know what's funny?

1255
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:51,760
It doesn't matter what game I'm playing.

1256
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,760
I always think it's funny to look over here

1257
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,760
and say

1258
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:59,539
why are you playing this?

1259
01:24:59,539 --> 01:25:01,539
I don't know. Why do anything?

1260
01:25:01,539 --> 01:25:08,829
At least a few times

1261
01:25:08,829 --> 01:25:10,829
I'll look over here and just see

1262
01:25:10,829 --> 01:25:14,479
why are you playing this?

1263
01:25:14,479 --> 01:25:16,479
I want to make this video games release

1264
01:25:16,479 --> 01:25:18,479
and I play them when they come out sometimes

1265
01:25:18,479 --> 01:25:20,479
and I just play games.

1266
01:25:20,479 --> 01:25:23,550
I don't know.

1267
01:25:23,550 --> 01:25:25,550
Why are you still playing this?

1268
01:25:25,550 --> 01:25:29,970
This is another good one.

1269
01:25:29,970 --> 01:25:31,970
I came back from a shower

1270
01:25:31,970 --> 01:25:33,970
and went out with my friends

1271
01:25:33,970 --> 01:25:35,970
and said why are you still playing this?

1272
01:25:35,970 --> 01:25:38,529
I don't know man. It would be nice to go out

1273
01:25:38,529 --> 01:25:41,020
with your friends, huh?

1274
01:25:41,020 --> 01:25:43,020
I'm trapped here.

1275
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:47,310
You need help.

1276
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:51,310
Go outside.

1277
01:25:59,310 --> 01:26:01,310
That was everyone last stream.

1278
01:26:01,310 --> 01:26:03,310
Yeah, that had to have been the most

1279
01:26:03,310 --> 01:26:06,239
ever.

1280
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:08,239
Of the like why are you still here?

1281
01:26:08,239 --> 01:26:10,239
You're torturing us. We don't talk about

1282
01:26:10,239 --> 01:26:12,239
yesterday's stream.

1283
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:14,239
Yesterday's stream.

1284
01:26:14,239 --> 01:26:17,359
What's the

1285
01:26:17,359 --> 01:26:19,359
not breaking

1286
01:26:19,359 --> 01:26:21,359
bad

1287
01:26:21,359 --> 01:26:23,359
what's it called?

1288
01:26:23,359 --> 01:26:27,390
Big Bang Theory.

1289
01:26:27,390 --> 01:26:29,390
Math, science, history. It's all of the history.

1290
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:31,390
It all started. That doesn't make any sense.

1291
01:26:31,390 --> 01:26:35,300
What am I trying to say to you guys?

1292
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:37,300
Isn't there a line in the

1293
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:39,300
Big Bang Theory that's like

1294
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:41,300
oh history but

1295
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:45,520
Ford is a mystery or something?

1296
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:51,409
It's like a song. What we have here

1297
01:26:51,409 --> 01:26:53,409
is history like Ford is a mystery.

1298
01:26:53,409 --> 01:26:57,500
What is it from?

1299
01:26:57,500 --> 01:27:08,380
That's from Kung Fu Panda. That's from

1300
01:27:08,380 --> 01:27:16,619
Karazhan. What is it?

1301
01:27:16,619 --> 01:27:18,619
Math, science, history unraveling the mystery.

1302
01:27:18,619 --> 01:27:20,619
No no but there's another one.

1303
01:27:24,619 --> 01:27:26,619
I made it up. No I didn't.

1304
01:27:26,619 --> 01:27:28,619
Yesterday was history. Tomorrow is a

1305
01:27:28,619 --> 01:27:30,619
mystery. Yeah what is it? Who said that?

1306
01:27:30,619 --> 01:27:32,619
Like Mark Twain? Who said that?

1307
01:27:32,619 --> 01:27:34,619
Seems promising to me.

1308
01:27:34,619 --> 01:27:36,619
All I need to start off is a root

1309
01:27:36,619 --> 01:27:38,619
and a fruit.

1310
01:27:38,619 --> 01:27:40,619
It's Kung Fu Panda.

1311
01:27:40,619 --> 01:27:42,619
Another fine day behind us.

1312
01:27:42,619 --> 01:27:44,619
Okay from Kung Fu Panda when

1313
01:27:44,619 --> 01:27:46,619
whatever the snake says that.

1314
01:27:46,619 --> 01:27:57,359
Fine day behind us.

1315
01:27:57,359 --> 01:27:59,359
That was a second video. The second

1316
01:27:59,359 --> 01:28:01,359
Jerma video title. Wait what?

1317
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:03,359
Is that where his memory is coming from?

1318
01:28:03,359 --> 01:28:05,359
That's a video title.

1319
01:28:05,359 --> 01:28:09,199
And I thought it was

1320
01:28:09,199 --> 01:28:11,199
the intro to the Big Bang Theory.

1321
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:17,789
These memories are

1322
01:28:17,789 --> 01:28:19,789
insane. Okay so wait that was just

1323
01:28:19,789 --> 01:28:21,789
a second Jerma title?

1324
01:28:21,789 --> 01:28:23,789
It's from a thumbnail.

1325
01:28:23,789 --> 01:28:32,369
Wait it's from this one.

1326
01:28:32,369 --> 01:28:34,369
Wait wait wait wait wait wait.

1327
01:28:34,369 --> 01:28:36,369
I need to see.

1328
01:28:36,369 --> 01:28:38,859
This video is called

1329
01:28:38,859 --> 01:28:40,859
Yesterday is history. Tomorrow

1330
01:28:40,859 --> 01:28:42,859
is a mystery.

1331
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:44,859
It all started with a Big Bang.

1332
01:28:44,859 --> 01:29:00,670
Oh boy

1333
01:29:00,670 --> 01:29:02,670
oh boy. It's not from Kung

1334
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:04,670
Fu Panda. What are you talking about?

1335
01:29:04,670 --> 01:29:06,670
It's a title of one of my videos.

1336
01:29:06,670 --> 01:29:16,659
Okay plant a root

1337
01:29:16,659 --> 01:29:19,859
bug snack in the garden.

1338
01:29:19,859 --> 01:29:21,859
I missed all that because I was like having

1339
01:29:21,859 --> 01:29:23,859
trouble. Alright what am I doing?

1340
01:29:23,859 --> 01:29:28,529
Plant a fruit bug snack

1341
01:29:28,529 --> 01:29:30,529
in the garden. Okay I gotta plant fruits

1342
01:29:30,529 --> 01:29:32,529
in the garden. Where's the garden?

1343
01:29:32,529 --> 01:29:34,529
Another fine day behind us. Quiet.

1344
01:29:34,529 --> 01:29:37,659
Where's the garden?

1345
01:29:37,659 --> 01:29:39,899
Is all going well?

1346
01:29:39,899 --> 01:29:48,979
Where's the garden? Garden?

1347
01:29:48,979 --> 01:29:50,979
Alright garden. Garden Grove.

1348
01:29:50,979 --> 01:29:52,979
Alright I gotta go to Garden Grove.

1349
01:29:52,979 --> 01:30:03,409
Snackberg. This is Garden Grove coming up here?

1350
01:30:03,409 --> 01:30:08,829
Nope. What's this?

1351
01:30:08,829 --> 01:30:10,829
Garden Grove? Garden Grove.

1352
01:30:10,829 --> 01:30:19,409
You went right past it.

1353
01:30:19,409 --> 01:30:21,409
Wait the garden. Not this.

1354
01:30:21,409 --> 01:30:24,539
We gotta talk to you anyways.

1355
01:30:24,539 --> 01:30:28,750
Okay.

1356
01:30:41,119 --> 01:30:43,119
Jerma the fucking link. Jerma the fucking link.

1357
01:30:43,119 --> 01:30:45,680
You guys need to calm down

1358
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:48,369
before you get me angry. Link.

1359
01:30:48,369 --> 01:30:51,760
This is from

1360
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:53,760
Kung Fu Panda.

1361
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:02,640
Yesterday

1362
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:04,640
is history.

1363
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:06,640
Tomorrow is a mystery.

1364
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:08,640
But today is a gift.

1365
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:10,640
That is why it is called

1366
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:13,069
the present.

1367
01:31:13,069 --> 01:31:15,069
Oh I didn't do the second half.

1368
01:31:15,069 --> 01:31:24,930
I stole that from

1369
01:31:24,930 --> 01:31:26,930
Kung Fu Panda. No I didn't.

1370
01:31:26,930 --> 01:31:28,930
I remembered it from the Big Bang

1371
01:31:28,930 --> 01:31:30,930
theory but I actually remembered

1372
01:31:30,930 --> 01:31:32,930
it from the title of one of my videos.

1373
01:31:32,930 --> 01:31:34,930
But it's truly

1374
01:31:34,930 --> 01:31:37,100
from Kung Fu Panda.

1375
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:44,529
You understand? Scan six

1376
01:31:44,529 --> 01:31:46,529
types of bug snacks in Garden Grove.

1377
01:31:46,529 --> 01:31:49,279
Got it.

1378
01:31:49,279 --> 01:31:51,279
I already got that one.

1379
01:31:51,279 --> 01:31:53,460
Who am I missing? What's this?

1380
01:31:53,460 --> 01:31:55,949
Candy Patch?

1381
01:31:55,949 --> 01:31:58,130
Apologize. Why?

1382
01:31:58,130 --> 01:32:05,939
Some bugs only come out at night.

1383
01:32:05,939 --> 01:32:07,939
So it's kind of like Stardew Valley fishing.

1384
01:32:07,939 --> 01:32:10,479
That's cool. I'm gonna

1385
01:32:10,479 --> 01:32:13,039
do this. What about in the cave?

1386
01:32:13,039 --> 01:32:15,039
I already got the fries.

1387
01:32:15,039 --> 01:32:28,529
I already got the burger.

1388
01:32:28,529 --> 01:32:30,529
Oh and that's you. Okay.

1389
01:32:30,529 --> 01:32:32,529
Um how do I get any other

1390
01:32:32,529 --> 01:32:38,289
bugs to come out?

1391
01:32:38,289 --> 01:32:40,289
Wait hold on. Oh that's a different one.

1392
01:32:40,289 --> 01:32:42,289
That's a white strappy.

1393
01:32:42,289 --> 01:32:47,659
That's a scare snack.

1394
01:32:47,659 --> 01:32:50,739
Okay so it scares away the snacks.

1395
01:32:50,739 --> 01:32:52,739
It's a poop pile.

1396
01:32:52,739 --> 01:32:54,739
Buried bug snack. These bug snacks have been

1397
01:32:54,739 --> 01:32:59,340
planted in the ground like crops.

1398
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:01,840
Is that a hot dog? Oh my god.

1399
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:06,260
It's a hot dog.

1400
01:33:06,260 --> 01:33:08,260
I need one more. But wait I want to get a hot dog.

1401
01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:15,539
I love him.

1402
01:33:15,539 --> 01:33:18,609
I love him. What's wrong with him?

1403
01:33:18,609 --> 01:33:20,850
He loves ketchup.

1404
01:33:20,850 --> 01:33:22,850
Okay. You love ketchup so much. We'll go over there.

1405
01:33:22,850 --> 01:33:35,649
Get the glissy.

1406
01:33:35,649 --> 01:33:41,020
Glissy. What's a glissy?

1407
01:33:41,020 --> 01:33:43,579
What's a glissy? Glissy?

1408
01:33:43,579 --> 01:33:47,229
I want this thing though.

1409
01:33:47,229 --> 01:33:54,829
What do you like? What are your interests?

1410
01:33:54,829 --> 01:34:00,659
You like chocolate? You love

1411
01:34:00,659 --> 01:34:02,659
chocolate. Well I don't think I even need to get

1412
01:34:02,659 --> 01:34:05,899
that. It's ketchup.

1413
01:34:05,899 --> 01:34:10,579
Hey a white strappy.

1414
01:34:10,579 --> 01:34:13,199
Where do I go?

1415
01:34:13,199 --> 01:34:15,949
Okay over here.

1416
01:34:15,949 --> 01:34:17,949
Do I pick up one of the poop guys?

1417
01:34:17,949 --> 01:34:22,050
It's a pickle.

1418
01:34:22,050 --> 01:34:24,350
Hinkle. Oh let's dig him up.

1419
01:34:24,350 --> 01:34:34,079
Is he dead? No I don't want to go to

1420
01:34:34,079 --> 01:34:36,079
Flavor Falls. That's a killer.

1421
01:34:36,079 --> 01:34:38,449
Oh man. He knocked it out of the

1422
01:34:38,449 --> 01:34:40,449
park man. We're at a joint.

1423
01:34:40,449 --> 01:34:43,380
Oh that's a killer.

1424
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:50,739
Hey you guys know that

1425
01:34:50,739 --> 01:34:52,739
I've watched a few diners drive-ins

1426
01:34:52,739 --> 01:34:54,739
and dives recently.

1427
01:34:54,739 --> 01:34:56,739
And he's really trying to get his son to take over.

1428
01:34:56,739 --> 01:34:58,739
I don't want to fucking do that anymore.

1429
01:34:58,739 --> 01:35:00,739
He keeps like putting his kind of older

1430
01:35:00,739 --> 01:35:02,739
son into the camera and stuff. It's like

1431
01:35:02,739 --> 01:35:04,739
oh this is my son Hunter.

1432
01:35:04,739 --> 01:35:07,229
And Hunter's like oh man that's delicious.

1433
01:35:07,229 --> 01:35:09,229
Flavor Town. He's like training his son

1434
01:35:09,229 --> 01:35:11,229
to take over the business so he can stop doing diners

1435
01:35:11,229 --> 01:35:14,819
drive-ins and dives. It's actually

1436
01:35:14,819 --> 01:35:16,819
kind of funny. It's like kind of wholesome in a way.

1437
01:35:16,819 --> 01:35:18,819
Because his son is

1438
01:35:18,819 --> 01:35:20,819
old enough now where he's kind of getting more

1439
01:35:20,819 --> 01:35:22,819
comfortable on camera and they both have like similar

1440
01:35:22,819 --> 01:35:24,819
catch phrases. You can tell he's like kind of

1441
01:35:24,819 --> 01:35:27,500
doing the catch phrases.

1442
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:29,500
Oh man, you totally killed it.

1443
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:31,500
You knocked it out of the park man.

1444
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:33,500
Yeah you knocked it out of the park. Right Hunter?

1445
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:35,500
And then eventually like he'll

1446
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:37,500
he's gonna, but is he gonna have the hair?

1447
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:39,500
I really hope

1448
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:41,500
that they do a full, a full complete

1449
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:43,500
transition from like father to son.

1450
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:45,500
And he gets the hair and he gets

1451
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:47,500
the blonde hair and the blonde goatee.

1452
01:35:47,500 --> 01:35:49,739
That would be unbelievable.

1453
01:35:49,739 --> 01:35:51,739
I would watch every episode.

1454
01:35:51,739 --> 01:35:55,520
They must always be a lich

1455
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:57,520
king. Yes, they must always

1456
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:59,520
be a lich king.

1457
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:01,520
Otherwise the whole society collapses.

1458
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:06,770
Without a

1459
01:36:06,770 --> 01:36:08,770
Guy Fieri

1460
01:36:08,770 --> 01:36:11,069
the whole thing comes down.

1461
01:36:11,069 --> 01:36:13,069
They must, oh I love that.

1462
01:36:13,069 --> 01:36:17,359
Fucking mod that guy for an hour.

1463
01:36:17,359 --> 01:36:22,670
Flavor King.

1464
01:36:22,670 --> 01:36:27,779
Where is this other bug?

1465
01:36:27,779 --> 01:36:33,539
I don't know where this other bug is.

1466
01:36:33,539 --> 01:36:35,539
Dude, don't put it past him man. World of

1467
01:36:35,539 --> 01:36:37,539
Warcraft's running out of shit to talk about.

1468
01:36:37,539 --> 01:36:40,859
Do not be surprised

1469
01:36:40,859 --> 01:36:42,859
if in ten years when World of Warcraft

1470
01:36:42,859 --> 01:36:44,859
is on its 30th expansion.

1471
01:36:44,859 --> 01:36:46,859
It's like, well, I guess like we

1472
01:36:46,859 --> 01:36:48,859
went to the place where everybody was dead.

1473
01:36:48,859 --> 01:36:51,229
We went to space.

1474
01:36:51,229 --> 01:36:53,229
We went to the center

1475
01:36:53,229 --> 01:36:55,729
of the fucking earth. We went

1476
01:36:55,729 --> 01:36:57,729
to hell. We went to heaven. I guess we're

1477
01:36:57,729 --> 01:37:00,609
gonna go to Flavortown. That's

1478
01:37:00,609 --> 01:37:02,779
what's left. And like Disney.

1479
01:37:02,779 --> 01:37:13,279
Like Disney World. Now should

1480
01:37:13,279 --> 01:37:15,279
I dig this up? Where this last

1481
01:37:15,279 --> 01:37:17,279
is one more bug? Where's this pickle bug?

1482
01:37:17,279 --> 01:37:22,579
Something in there.

1483
01:37:22,579 --> 01:37:24,579
I would play that expansion. That

1484
01:37:24,579 --> 01:37:26,579
would be the only thing that would bring me back to well.

1485
01:37:26,579 --> 01:37:29,069
And I'm talking about a fully

1486
01:37:29,069 --> 01:37:31,069
voice acted, but still in

1487
01:37:31,069 --> 01:37:33,069
kind of like the shitty World of Warcraft

1488
01:37:33,069 --> 01:37:35,069
engine Guy Fieri. And it's just

1489
01:37:35,069 --> 01:37:37,069
a human model. Just the standard

1490
01:37:37,069 --> 01:37:39,069
human model that they just gave a

1491
01:37:39,069 --> 01:37:41,069
blonde goatee and spiky blonde

1492
01:37:41,069 --> 01:37:43,699
hair to. Cause that's what they're

1493
01:37:43,699 --> 01:37:55,600
capable of doing. I got a pee.

1494
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:57,600
I'll be right back. It's pee time.

1495
01:37:57,600 --> 01:42:02,210
You know, I don't understand how it gets so hot

1496
01:42:02,210 --> 01:42:05,859
in here. When I'm sitting in

1497
01:42:05,859 --> 01:42:08,159
this room, do I just

1498
01:42:08,159 --> 01:42:10,779
eliminate heat?

1499
01:42:10,779 --> 01:42:12,779
Inside of this room, it has

1500
01:42:12,779 --> 01:42:14,960
to be 10 degrees hotter

1501
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:16,960
than the next room out of this

1502
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:21,489
door. Wow.

1503
01:42:21,489 --> 01:42:25,199
It's cold. Let's go.

1504
01:42:25,199 --> 01:42:29,100
World of Warcraft.

1505
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:31,600
Can you imagine? Sorry.

1506
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:34,930
Where was I? I need to get six bugs.

1507
01:42:34,930 --> 01:42:40,369
It's cold in Nevada. Oh yeah.

1508
01:42:40,369 --> 01:42:42,369
It gets really cold in Nevada.

1509
01:42:42,369 --> 01:42:45,760
That's a sweetie fly.

1510
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:48,960
It eventually sits down to

1511
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:51,840
rest. Where? Up in the

1512
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:56,899
sky. Remember, Nevada's the desert.

1513
01:42:56,899 --> 01:42:58,899
So it gets really, really, really

1514
01:42:58,899 --> 01:43:00,899
hot and really, really, really cold.

1515
01:43:00,899 --> 01:43:07,170
There's really no in-between in Nevada.

1516
01:43:07,170 --> 01:43:10,430
I scanned all the things.

1517
01:43:19,250 --> 01:43:21,250
Click the link, please.

1518
01:43:21,250 --> 01:43:23,250
Here's the- but I don't understand.

1519
01:43:23,250 --> 01:43:25,250
Why is he not like a dwarf

1520
01:43:25,250 --> 01:43:27,250
or a human?

1521
01:43:27,250 --> 01:43:29,250
I don't think- I wouldn't consider Guy

1522
01:43:29,250 --> 01:43:31,250
Fieri to be a- like a blood elf.

1523
01:43:35,250 --> 01:43:37,250
Would you?

1524
01:43:37,250 --> 01:43:39,250
Hold on, what can I- where is this?

1525
01:43:39,250 --> 01:43:41,250
Oh, there we go. Yeah, I don't think-

1526
01:43:41,250 --> 01:43:43,250
I don't see this to be actually

1527
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:45,250
an actual bug.

1528
01:43:45,250 --> 01:43:54,079
I don't see this to be an actual

1529
01:43:54,079 --> 01:43:57,520
bug.

1530
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:59,520
I don't think- I don't see

1531
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:02,020
this to be accurate.

1532
01:44:02,020 --> 01:44:04,020
That's Guy Fieri.

1533
01:44:04,020 --> 01:44:07,920
Guy Fireeye.

1534
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:15,470
No, no, that's all wrong.

1535
01:44:15,470 --> 01:44:17,470
This needs to be a dwarf.

1536
01:44:17,470 --> 01:44:19,470
No, but they need to take the dwarf and

1537
01:44:19,470 --> 01:44:21,470
stretch the dwarf out longer.

1538
01:44:21,470 --> 01:44:23,470
Have it be the only model in the game

1539
01:44:23,470 --> 01:44:25,470
that has a Gumby body.

1540
01:44:25,470 --> 01:44:27,470
Just stretch out the legs and the torso

1541
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:34,510
and give him the goatee and the hair.

1542
01:44:34,510 --> 01:44:36,510
Oh, by the way,

1543
01:44:36,510 --> 01:44:38,510
see you guys in like probably a couple

1544
01:44:38,510 --> 01:44:40,510
times back. We're gonna get

1545
01:44:40,510 --> 01:44:42,510
new 2021-2022

1546
01:44:42,510 --> 01:44:44,510
Gumby. They're gonna bring it back.

1547
01:44:44,510 --> 01:44:47,899
You know that's up next.

1548
01:44:47,899 --> 01:44:49,899
I'll just stamp this.

1549
01:44:49,899 --> 01:44:51,899
It's definitely coming up next for the things

1550
01:44:51,899 --> 01:44:53,899
we're bringing back as a group.

1551
01:44:53,899 --> 01:44:58,899
Not me and you, but them.

1552
01:44:58,899 --> 01:45:00,899
Alright, what's your favorite?

1553
01:45:04,899 --> 01:45:09,699
The establishment, yep.

1554
01:45:09,699 --> 01:45:12,699
The establishment.

1555
01:45:12,699 --> 01:45:14,699
The Illuminati.

1556
01:45:14,699 --> 01:45:18,220
The TV Illuminati.

1557
01:45:18,220 --> 01:45:20,220
What do we bring back next?

1558
01:45:20,220 --> 01:45:22,220
How about...

1559
01:45:22,220 --> 01:45:24,220
Elmo. Wait, no, he's already here.

1560
01:45:24,220 --> 01:45:26,220
He's already here permanently.

1561
01:45:26,220 --> 01:45:29,420
Maybe...

1562
01:45:29,420 --> 01:45:34,800
What was that little bald kid's name?

1563
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:40,369
Bring him back too.

1564
01:45:40,369 --> 01:45:45,939
Caillou.

1565
01:45:45,939 --> 01:45:52,720
Doesn't everybody hate Caillou?

1566
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:54,960
I was under the assumption that Caillou was horrible.

1567
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:56,960
And kids were like being

1568
01:45:56,960 --> 01:45:59,260
naughty and stuff after they watched Caillou.

1569
01:45:59,260 --> 01:46:02,340
Am I making that up?

1570
01:46:02,340 --> 01:46:04,340
Feed her favorite

1571
01:46:04,340 --> 01:46:06,340
bug snack. I hope it's hot dogs.

1572
01:46:06,340 --> 01:46:12,479
I didn't pay attention.

1573
01:46:25,039 --> 01:46:27,039
Is that a hot dog arm?

1574
01:46:27,039 --> 01:46:29,039
Totally mysterious before he goes to bed

1575
01:46:29,039 --> 01:46:31,039
around 10 every night.

1576
01:46:31,039 --> 01:46:33,039
I want you to find out

1577
01:46:33,039 --> 01:46:35,039
what he's up to. And tell me.

1578
01:46:35,039 --> 01:46:37,039
If you don't want to wait around

1579
01:46:37,039 --> 01:46:39,039
you can always just take a nap until it's time.

1580
01:46:39,039 --> 01:46:41,039
Wait, you can sleep?

1581
01:46:41,039 --> 01:46:43,220
Okay, find out what Wampus does between

1582
01:46:43,220 --> 01:46:45,220
10 PM and 1 AM.

1583
01:46:45,220 --> 01:46:48,289
I didn't know you could sleep. Alright.

1584
01:46:48,289 --> 01:46:50,289
Between 10 PM and 1 AM we're gonna

1585
01:46:50,289 --> 01:46:52,979
find out what Wampus is doing.

1586
01:46:52,979 --> 01:46:54,979
Okay, sleep until

1587
01:46:54,979 --> 01:46:59,439
5 PM.

1588
01:46:59,439 --> 01:47:01,439
Watch? Oh, it's down the lower left. Okay. Between

1589
01:47:01,439 --> 01:47:03,439
10 and 1. We're gonna go find

1590
01:47:03,439 --> 01:47:13,039
Wampus. Zerking off

1591
01:47:13,039 --> 01:47:20,979
for 3 hours.

1592
01:47:20,979 --> 01:47:22,979
I love how you guys have found this great

1593
01:47:22,979 --> 01:47:24,979
way. And I'll be honest, me too.

1594
01:47:24,979 --> 01:47:26,979
Of like getting around the sensors.

1595
01:47:26,979 --> 01:47:28,979
I didn't say

1596
01:47:28,979 --> 01:47:30,979
that. I said zerking off. It's

1597
01:47:30,979 --> 01:47:33,600
different.

1598
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:40,159
Dude, you look like a clown.

1599
01:47:40,159 --> 01:47:42,159
Alright, what do you want me to do?

1600
01:47:44,159 --> 01:47:46,159
Well, buddy.

1601
01:47:46,159 --> 01:47:48,159
Well, if you don't mind,

1602
01:47:48,159 --> 01:47:50,159
I'd love to fly it someday.

1603
01:47:50,159 --> 01:47:54,699
Okay, sure. Maybe one day

1604
01:47:54,699 --> 01:47:58,029
you'll fly this. Should we tell

1605
01:47:58,029 --> 01:48:00,029
him? Should we tell him?

1606
01:48:00,029 --> 01:48:02,029
That's not ever gonna happen. Alright, I got another thing

1607
01:48:02,029 --> 01:48:04,529
for you to eat. Look, I've got a

1608
01:48:04,529 --> 01:48:06,529
strawberry and I'm gonna put it on your

1609
01:48:06,529 --> 01:48:08,529
eye. Oh.

1610
01:48:08,529 --> 01:48:13,779
We're only gonna feed this guy

1611
01:48:13,779 --> 01:48:15,779
and make him like the top dog.

1612
01:48:15,779 --> 01:48:18,210
We're gonna make this guy the alpha.

1613
01:48:18,210 --> 01:48:23,569
Ooh, plant!

1614
01:48:23,569 --> 01:48:25,569
Okay. Pick a bug snack

1615
01:48:25,569 --> 01:48:27,569
to plant. Oh, shit.

1616
01:48:27,569 --> 01:48:30,260
We shouldn't have. Alright.

1617
01:48:30,260 --> 01:48:32,560
I mean, I'll remember where this is.

1618
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:38,260
But I need to spy on this guy between, alright.

1619
01:48:38,260 --> 01:48:43,819
We need to wait till 10 PM.

1620
01:48:43,819 --> 01:48:45,819
Okay, he loves

1621
01:48:45,819 --> 01:48:51,710
the green guy. How much is it?

1622
01:48:51,710 --> 01:48:53,710
Six. Shit, I got here really early.

1623
01:48:53,710 --> 01:48:59,390
Just sleep.

1624
01:48:59,390 --> 01:49:04,829
No, I can't. How long would it take

1625
01:49:04,829 --> 01:49:06,829
for you to read the entire Bible?

1626
01:49:06,829 --> 01:49:09,760
Um, that's probably a pretty long

1627
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:12,899
time. Probably

1628
01:49:12,899 --> 01:49:15,069
a few, at least a few days.

1629
01:49:15,069 --> 01:49:18,909
I can't, I have trouble

1630
01:49:18,909 --> 01:49:20,909
I can't read the Bible. It's just, the way

1631
01:49:20,909 --> 01:49:22,909
that it's worded and the way that it's

1632
01:49:22,909 --> 01:49:24,909
spread out and the paragraphing and

1633
01:49:24,909 --> 01:49:26,909
I can't follow it. It just feels like somebody's

1634
01:49:26,909 --> 01:49:28,909
speaking at me while I

1635
01:49:28,909 --> 01:49:30,909
have my ears covered. You know what I mean? It's like I'm kind of

1636
01:49:30,909 --> 01:49:32,909
hearing what you're saying but I don't get it. I can't comprehend

1637
01:49:32,909 --> 01:49:43,899
it. I'm gonna read a

1638
01:49:43,899 --> 01:49:47,939
kid's Bible. No, of that

1639
01:49:47,939 --> 01:49:50,670
kids edition?

1640
01:49:50,670 --> 01:49:59,180
Kids edition.

1641
01:49:59,180 --> 01:50:01,739
Read the Bible

1642
01:50:01,739 --> 01:50:08,909
Manga. Bible picture

1643
01:50:08,909 --> 01:50:13,520
book. Why are you guys on the Bible

1644
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:15,890
right now? What about you here?

1645
01:50:15,890 --> 01:50:24,000
Alright, it's 8pm. I'm

1646
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:30,140
gonna follow this guy. Read the

1647
01:50:30,140 --> 01:50:32,140
Minecraft Bible. Is this a Minecraft

1648
01:50:32,140 --> 01:50:41,229
Bible? Lego

1649
01:50:41,229 --> 01:50:44,609
Bible. Who's

1650
01:50:44,609 --> 01:50:51,010
that?

1651
01:50:51,010 --> 01:50:58,369
Fortnite Bible. Holy shit, I saw

1652
01:50:58,369 --> 01:51:00,369
the Lego Bible at Costco one time.

1653
01:51:00,369 --> 01:51:02,369
You made that up. That's a glory,

1654
01:51:02,369 --> 01:51:04,369
the best part about the internet. You can just write

1655
01:51:04,369 --> 01:51:06,369
anything and just say it's real.

1656
01:51:06,369 --> 01:51:21,579
8.30. It's not real.

1657
01:51:21,579 --> 01:51:23,579
It's not real. There's no Lego Bible.

1658
01:51:23,579 --> 01:51:26,590
It wouldn't surprise me though because it's

1659
01:51:26,590 --> 01:51:35,420
Lego everything. Brick

1660
01:51:35,420 --> 01:51:37,420
Testament. Yeah, but I think

1661
01:51:37,420 --> 01:51:55,470
that- shh, quiet.

1662
01:51:55,470 --> 01:52:11,279
What you doing? It's 9.30.

1663
01:52:11,279 --> 01:52:16,340
It's too early. Don't go

1664
01:52:16,340 --> 01:52:22,029
in. Oh shit, okay. 9.45.

1665
01:52:22,029 --> 01:52:24,029
9.50.

1666
01:52:24,029 --> 01:52:27,229
He's getting ready to do

1667
01:52:27,229 --> 01:52:29,859
something. He's getting ready

1668
01:52:29,859 --> 01:52:31,859
to do something. I'm not gonna look at him anymore.

1669
01:52:31,859 --> 01:52:34,100
I'm not gonna look at him anymore.

1670
01:52:34,100 --> 01:52:36,100
I'm not gonna look at him anymore through the window until 10.

1671
01:52:36,100 --> 01:52:38,270
Okay, it's 10. What does it do?

1672
01:52:38,270 --> 01:52:40,270
I can't look through this window from this

1673
01:52:40,270 --> 01:52:42,270
perspective. I can't.

1674
01:52:42,270 --> 01:52:44,270
I just can't do it. What is he doing?

1675
01:52:44,270 --> 01:52:52,699
What are you doing?

1676
01:52:52,699 --> 01:52:55,899
What is he doing?

1677
01:53:14,539 --> 01:53:18,449
Alright, we got it.

1678
01:53:18,449 --> 01:53:21,890
Hey.

1679
01:53:25,890 --> 01:53:27,890
Talk to him through his window that I've been spying

1680
01:53:27,890 --> 01:53:30,449
on him through.

1681
01:53:30,449 --> 01:53:37,229
Alright, let's go report back.

1682
01:53:37,229 --> 01:53:47,090
I need a root and a fruit. Why are you doing

1683
01:53:47,090 --> 01:53:49,710
all this shit for her?

1684
01:53:49,710 --> 01:53:51,710
Because it's a quest and you get experience.

1685
01:53:51,710 --> 01:53:56,260
Plus, we're gonna double cross this lady.

1686
01:54:07,060 --> 01:54:09,060
Ugh,

1687
01:54:09,060 --> 01:54:11,060
Snaxburg sounds way more fun than sitting around

1688
01:54:11,060 --> 01:54:13,060
in this cave. I thought it

1689
01:54:13,060 --> 01:54:15,060
would be relaxing, but it's totes boring.

1690
01:54:15,060 --> 01:54:17,060
Like boring like playing

1691
01:54:17,060 --> 01:54:19,060
solitaire by yourself and you've been

1692
01:54:19,060 --> 01:54:21,060
on the floor? Oh, sorry. I've got a little bit

1693
01:54:21,060 --> 01:54:23,060
my chest is a little itchy.

1694
01:54:25,060 --> 01:54:33,760
Okay. I have to plant a root.

1695
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:35,939
Alright, we gotta get some bugs.

1696
01:54:35,939 --> 01:54:37,939
Plant a root and plant a fruit.

1697
01:54:37,939 --> 01:54:39,939
What is that? That's a diet

1698
01:54:39,939 --> 01:54:41,939
coke. That's a floating diet coke.

1699
01:54:41,939 --> 01:54:44,109
That's a Dr. Sody.

1700
01:54:44,109 --> 01:54:46,109
Okay, I have to have Dr. Sody.

1701
01:54:46,109 --> 01:54:48,109
There's no way I don't get Dr.

1702
01:54:48,109 --> 01:54:50,109
Sody. Are you kidding me?

1703
01:54:50,109 --> 01:54:56,380
Aww, Dr. Sody!

1704
01:54:56,380 --> 01:55:02,060
Yes!

1705
01:55:02,060 --> 01:55:05,779
Awesome. Alright, who gets

1706
01:55:05,779 --> 01:55:09,359
to drink Dr. Sody?

1707
01:55:09,359 --> 01:55:11,359
We need a fruit though. Alright, I need a

1708
01:55:11,359 --> 01:55:13,359
strawberry and what's a root?

1709
01:55:13,359 --> 01:55:16,109
This is all fast food. This is the fast food

1710
01:55:16,109 --> 01:55:18,539
section. I need a

1711
01:55:18,539 --> 01:55:21,300
carrot. Carrot and a

1712
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:23,300
Alright, we gotta go back to the other area. This is the fast food

1713
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:32,770
area. French fries are not a root.

1714
01:55:32,770 --> 01:55:40,829
It's a potato.

1715
01:55:40,829 --> 01:55:43,140
That's like saying pizza is tomato.

1716
01:55:43,140 --> 01:55:47,300
No, that's not a tomato.

1717
01:55:47,300 --> 01:55:51,970
Tomato is part of it.

1718
01:55:51,970 --> 01:55:53,970
Pizza's not a vegetable because there's tomato on it.

1719
01:55:53,970 --> 01:55:55,970
They tried that like ten years ago. I remember.

1720
01:55:55,970 --> 01:56:07,550
Who should we give this to?

1721
01:56:07,550 --> 01:56:13,229
Who are you to decide?

1722
01:56:13,229 --> 01:56:17,819
Um, I don't know. I just did.

1723
01:56:17,819 --> 01:56:19,819
Alright, soda. You want the soda?

1724
01:56:19,819 --> 01:56:21,819
You. Ramble.

1725
01:56:21,819 --> 01:56:23,819
Wake up.

1726
01:56:23,819 --> 01:56:25,819
Let's turn this guy into a Dr. Pepper.

1727
01:56:25,819 --> 01:56:27,819
No, get over here. Eat.

1728
01:56:27,819 --> 01:56:30,319
Okay. Oh, wait. No, no, no. You don't

1729
01:56:30,319 --> 01:56:32,319
eat these animals, right? Or these bugs.

1730
01:56:32,319 --> 01:56:34,319
Never done an interview before.

1731
01:56:34,319 --> 01:56:37,579
How's it work?

1732
01:56:37,579 --> 01:56:39,579
Is it soda? I guess it has

1733
01:56:39,579 --> 01:56:41,579
eyes. Does it make it alive?

1734
01:56:41,579 --> 01:56:46,130
Okay. Who are you?

1735
01:56:46,130 --> 01:56:50,800
Heard Lizbert was gathering up some grumps

1736
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:54,260
to be part of her new family. Use one

1737
01:56:54,260 --> 01:56:56,260
of those. Swimming and crawling. Alright, yeah.

1738
01:56:56,260 --> 01:56:58,260
Who are you though?

1739
01:56:58,260 --> 01:57:00,260
Ramble? Giggle funny. I look after

1740
01:57:00,260 --> 01:57:02,260
all the bugsnacks in town and make sure they don't

1741
01:57:02,260 --> 01:57:06,100
wander off. You don't have a family?

1742
01:57:06,100 --> 01:57:08,529
I did. When they

1743
01:57:08,529 --> 01:57:12,560
we talk about something else.

1744
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:16,210
Well, they're just the cutest little

1745
01:57:16,210 --> 01:57:18,210
things, aren't they? I don't

1746
01:57:18,210 --> 01:57:20,210
understand how anybody could look into their

1747
01:57:20,210 --> 01:57:22,210
googly little eyes and want to eat them.

1748
01:57:22,210 --> 01:57:25,600
But, yeah,

1749
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:28,159
everybody does eat them though.

1750
01:57:28,159 --> 01:57:30,590
Well, they don't eat none and that's what counts.

1751
01:57:30,590 --> 01:57:33,600
Why did you leave?

1752
01:57:33,600 --> 01:57:35,899
Liz, to bring in snacks, everybody got

1753
01:57:35,899 --> 01:57:38,909
mighty hunted. Untreated my barn

1754
01:57:38,909 --> 01:57:40,909
like a grocery store.

1755
01:57:40,909 --> 01:57:42,909
I held him off for a while,

1756
01:57:42,909 --> 01:57:45,340
but I should have known Wambus never quits.

1757
01:57:45,340 --> 01:57:49,359
Next

1758
01:57:49,359 --> 01:57:51,359
night I woke up to him throwing my snacks into a sack.

1759
01:57:51,359 --> 01:57:55,069
And I let the rest go free.

1760
01:57:55,069 --> 01:57:57,069
Broke my heart,

1761
01:57:57,069 --> 01:57:59,069
but it's better than them getting eaten.

1762
01:57:59,069 --> 01:58:01,069
I left that night for the beach

1763
01:58:01,069 --> 01:58:03,069
and started rebuilding my family.

1764
01:58:03,069 --> 01:58:05,069
The Siege of the Barn.

1765
01:58:05,069 --> 01:58:10,510
The eagle's a lot,

1766
01:58:10,510 --> 01:58:13,069
but she's got a good heart.

1767
01:58:13,069 --> 01:58:15,069
If she really likes me, she'll learn to love

1768
01:58:15,069 --> 01:58:17,069
bugsnacks the way I do.

1769
01:58:17,069 --> 01:58:19,819
Alright, what about Lizbert?

1770
01:58:19,819 --> 01:58:22,449
Where did she go?

1771
01:58:32,689 --> 01:58:35,119
Aww.

1772
01:58:35,119 --> 01:58:37,119
Bugtacks?

1773
01:58:37,119 --> 01:58:39,119
Alright, but what happened to Lizbert?

1774
01:59:00,239 --> 01:59:02,239
Did you sleepwalk kill Lizbert?

1775
01:59:02,239 --> 01:59:04,239
You're getting really defensive when we bring up Lizbert.

1776
01:59:04,239 --> 01:59:06,859
You don't eat bugsnacks,

1777
01:59:06,859 --> 01:59:08,859
but that doesn't mean you don't eat

1778
01:59:08,859 --> 01:59:11,810
puppet humans.

1779
01:59:11,810 --> 01:59:13,810
Oh, a key.

1780
01:59:13,810 --> 01:59:22,380
Oh, what?

1781
01:59:22,380 --> 01:59:28,720
Oh.

1782
01:59:28,720 --> 01:59:30,720
Okay, I got it. Oh.

1783
01:59:30,720 --> 01:59:34,560
Oh, I got it.

1784
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:36,859
What happened?

1785
01:59:36,859 --> 01:59:42,300
Philbo wants to talk to you.

1786
01:59:42,300 --> 01:59:45,500
I'm here.

1787
01:59:45,500 --> 01:59:47,500
What can I do for you, Philbert?

1788
01:59:47,500 --> 01:59:49,810
Oh, you have something to tell me.

1789
01:59:49,810 --> 01:59:54,539
Among us stream when?

1790
01:59:54,539 --> 01:59:57,680
I've never.

1791
01:59:57,680 --> 01:59:59,680
I will never play that game on stream.

1792
01:59:59,680 --> 02:00:01,680
Not one time.

1793
02:00:03,680 --> 02:00:05,680
I plan on trying it tomorrow.

1794
02:00:05,680 --> 02:00:07,680
Alright, donate six bugsnacks

1795
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:09,680
to the ranch.

1796
02:00:09,680 --> 02:00:11,680
I already have a soda snack.

1797
02:00:11,680 --> 02:00:13,680
Wait, do you want this? Here, drink this.

1798
02:00:13,680 --> 02:00:15,680
Okay.

1799
02:00:15,680 --> 02:00:17,979
Okay.

1800
02:00:17,979 --> 02:00:19,979
Okay.

1801
02:00:19,979 --> 02:00:21,979
Okay.

1802
02:00:21,979 --> 02:00:23,979
Wait, do you want this? Here, drink this.

1803
02:00:23,979 --> 02:00:27,489
Look what I got.

1804
02:00:27,489 --> 02:00:32,289
Try that.

1805
02:00:32,289 --> 02:00:34,529
A straw mustache.

1806
02:00:34,529 --> 02:00:41,439
Cool.

1807
02:00:41,439 --> 02:00:43,939
Practice your lying.

1808
02:00:43,939 --> 02:00:45,939
Do I really need to do that?

1809
02:00:45,939 --> 02:00:48,239
I lie to you guys literally every single day.

1810
02:00:48,239 --> 02:00:51,439
Do I need to practice?

1811
02:00:57,439 --> 02:00:59,439
Guys,

1812
02:00:59,439 --> 02:01:01,869
my first name is Dan.

1813
02:01:01,869 --> 02:01:03,869
I'm like, can we be real about this?

1814
02:01:03,869 --> 02:01:10,460
Okay, let's go.

1815
02:01:10,460 --> 02:01:20,050
Dance party.

1816
02:01:22,050 --> 02:01:24,050
Somebody go over there and start talking to him.

1817
02:01:24,050 --> 02:01:26,050
Somebody go over there and start talking to him so he stops.

1818
02:01:26,050 --> 02:01:28,050
Somebody just go talk to him so he stops.

1819
02:01:28,050 --> 02:01:30,050
Hey, man, what's up?

1820
02:01:30,050 --> 02:01:32,050
Come over here, I gotta talk to you.

1821
02:01:34,050 --> 02:01:38,850
Wait, I only made like two friends.

1822
02:01:38,850 --> 02:01:43,890
The farmer,

1823
02:01:43,890 --> 02:01:46,319
the serial killer,

1824
02:01:46,319 --> 02:01:48,689
the weirdo, and the mean girl.

1825
02:01:48,689 --> 02:01:51,250
This is quite the Wizard of Oz group.

1826
02:01:51,250 --> 02:01:58,979
Oh, this is disgusting.

1827
02:01:58,979 --> 02:02:02,619
I don't know why, I just felt like I was in VR.

1828
02:02:02,619 --> 02:02:04,930
Oh, look, I picked up this cup.

1829
02:02:04,930 --> 02:02:06,930
Shake it around, throw it. Ooh, VR.

1830
02:02:09,170 --> 02:02:11,789
Okay, what are we doing?

1831
02:02:13,789 --> 02:02:15,789
Some kind of suicide squad.

1832
02:02:17,789 --> 02:02:19,789
Yeah, we all die in the first two minutes of the movie.

1833
02:02:29,220 --> 02:02:31,460
How's the butt juice?

1834
02:02:31,460 --> 02:02:33,460
Isn't this just water?

1835
02:02:33,460 --> 02:02:35,460
Well, uh, it's bug

1836
02:02:35,460 --> 02:02:37,460
infused.

1837
02:02:37,460 --> 02:02:39,460
Why do I feel like we're gonna get a South Park Stan

1838
02:02:39,460 --> 02:02:41,460
and Wendy puking his mouth scenario?

1839
02:02:41,460 --> 02:02:46,939
Remember they used to do that?

1840
02:02:46,939 --> 02:02:48,939
Every time Stan talked to Wendy,

1841
02:02:48,939 --> 02:02:50,939
he puked in her

1842
02:02:50,939 --> 02:02:56,060
fucking face.

1843
02:02:56,060 --> 02:02:58,060
They did it for so long, too.

1844
02:02:58,060 --> 02:03:02,350
Did they give up doing that?

1845
02:03:02,350 --> 02:03:04,350
That was a thing they did for 10 to 15 straight years.

1846
02:03:04,350 --> 02:03:06,350
Do they still do that?

1847
02:03:06,350 --> 02:03:11,579
Yes, they stopped.

1848
02:03:11,579 --> 02:03:13,579
They stopped doing it when they started dating.

1849
02:03:13,579 --> 02:03:20,880
Oh, that show is

1850
02:03:20,880 --> 02:03:27,920
insane.

1851
02:03:35,819 --> 02:03:37,819
They stopped it in like 2004.

1852
02:03:46,319 --> 02:03:48,319
South Park games?

1853
02:03:48,319 --> 02:03:50,319
It was on the website,

1854
02:03:50,319 --> 02:03:52,319
those little flash games, right?

1855
02:03:55,069 --> 02:04:00,699
Who else should I talk to?

1856
02:04:00,699 --> 02:04:02,699
Alright, I didn't talk to the farmer.

1857
02:04:02,699 --> 02:04:16,590
Can I change the radio? This party sucks.

1858
02:04:16,590 --> 02:04:23,569
This is the kind of party that you show up to

1859
02:04:23,569 --> 02:04:25,569
and you realize what's going on

1860
02:04:25,569 --> 02:04:29,340
and you

1861
02:04:29,340 --> 02:04:31,710
grab like a water

1862
02:04:31,710 --> 02:04:33,710
and you're like, yeah, I'll take a water.

1863
02:04:33,710 --> 02:04:38,699
This is a water party.

1864
02:04:38,699 --> 02:04:40,699
I'll be dipping out in probably 40 minutes.

1865
02:04:40,699 --> 02:04:47,300
Maybe an hour.

1866
02:04:47,300 --> 02:04:49,729
Yeah, I've already mingled.

1867
02:04:49,729 --> 02:04:52,800
Now what?

1868
02:05:07,420 --> 02:05:10,609
Oh, that's unfortunate.

1869
02:05:18,739 --> 02:05:20,739
Hey, bro.

1870
02:05:20,739 --> 02:05:22,739
You've been drinking water, right?

1871
02:05:22,739 --> 02:05:24,739
Yeah, yeah, I've been drinking water.

1872
02:05:24,739 --> 02:05:26,739
Yeah, I'm just

1873
02:05:26,739 --> 02:05:28,739
checking to see if we're on the same page.

1874
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:53,760
Is somebody

1875
02:05:53,760 --> 02:05:55,760
reacting to my ass? I don't know.

1876
02:05:55,760 --> 02:06:00,109
Wrong link.

1877
02:06:00,109 --> 02:06:02,289
It was the wrong link.

1878
02:06:02,289 --> 02:06:08,689
I feel like it wasn't.

1879
02:06:08,689 --> 02:06:20,510
This one, right?

1880
02:06:20,510 --> 02:06:26,659
Links are getting obliterated.

1881
02:06:26,659 --> 02:06:29,789
No, not that one.

1882
02:06:29,789 --> 02:06:31,789
How is it wrong?

1883
02:06:31,789 --> 02:06:34,289
It's like being spammed.

1884
02:06:34,289 --> 02:06:39,279
There's no such thing as a wrong link.

1885
02:06:39,279 --> 02:06:41,279
Okay, this is scary.

1886
02:06:41,279 --> 02:06:53,039
Is this the one?

1887
02:06:53,039 --> 02:06:56,050
Alright, I'm going to do an experiment.

1888
02:06:56,050 --> 02:06:58,800
Everybody quiet. Don't type.

1889
02:06:58,800 --> 02:07:07,250
I'm serious, like do not, just don't type at all.

1890
02:07:07,250 --> 02:07:09,250
Don't even do like the dot dot dots.

1891
02:07:09,250 --> 02:07:14,720
Nobody chat. Quiet.

1892
02:07:14,720 --> 02:07:38,020
Sit here. I want some new people to come in.

1893
02:07:38,020 --> 02:07:40,020
This is a 10k concurrent stream.

1894
02:07:40,020 --> 02:07:42,020
People are going to think this is

1895
02:07:42,020 --> 02:07:44,020
going to come, people are going to think this is like a

1896
02:07:44,020 --> 02:07:47,470
botted channel. This channel is going to get like reported.

1897
02:07:47,470 --> 02:07:50,420
Yeah, Twitch, this is like a botted channel

1898
02:07:50,420 --> 02:07:52,420
just with this like weird scary imposter

1899
02:07:52,420 --> 02:07:54,420
thing on this botted viewbot channel.

1900
02:07:54,420 --> 02:07:57,979
Shut it down.

1901
02:07:57,979 --> 02:08:04,960
I don't know who the fuck this guy is.

1902
02:08:06,960 --> 02:08:09,199
That joke is a month old.

1903
02:08:11,890 --> 02:08:13,890
Wait, somebody made that a month ago and I didn't see it?

1904
02:08:17,890 --> 02:08:19,890
Yo, bro.

1905
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:31,819
You drinking water?

1906
02:08:33,819 --> 02:08:35,819
Okay, dude, just making sure we're on the same fucking page.

1907
02:08:35,819 --> 02:08:38,130
Don't act like you're in charge.

1908
02:08:38,130 --> 02:08:40,130
If you had the spine to lead us,

1909
02:08:40,130 --> 02:08:42,130
everybody would still be here.

1910
02:08:42,130 --> 02:08:44,130
Don't you mean, Trippany

1911
02:08:44,130 --> 02:08:46,130
would still be here?

1912
02:08:46,130 --> 02:08:48,130
Fine, all y'all gang up on me.

1913
02:08:48,130 --> 02:08:50,130
Don't make me wrong.

1914
02:08:50,130 --> 02:08:52,130
You all want Trippany back so bad?

1915
02:08:52,130 --> 02:08:54,130
Go find her yourself.

1916
02:08:54,130 --> 02:08:58,800
Yo, bro, you want to get out of here?

1917
02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:00,979
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1918
02:09:00,979 --> 02:09:02,979
This party, I knew it, it was a bad party.

1919
02:09:13,119 --> 02:09:15,119
Yeah, skimmy.

1920
02:09:15,119 --> 02:09:17,119
You sure have had quite a few though.

1921
02:09:17,119 --> 02:09:19,300
Wow.

1922
02:09:21,300 --> 02:09:23,300
A whole strabby.

1923
02:09:25,300 --> 02:09:27,300
It is drugs.

1924
02:09:29,300 --> 02:09:31,300
Wait, food poisoning?

1925
02:09:51,229 --> 02:09:53,659
Poisoned.

1926
02:09:53,659 --> 02:09:58,270
Get away from me, give me some space.

1927
02:10:00,270 --> 02:10:07,039
What the hell?

1928
02:10:07,039 --> 02:10:10,880
Philbo, what the heck?

1929
02:10:12,880 --> 02:10:14,880
Alright, I need to donate six snacks.

1930
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:16,880
It's Jeff from American Dead.

1931
02:10:32,989 --> 02:10:34,989
It's Jeff.

1932
02:10:34,989 --> 02:10:36,989
Have it, Jeff.

1933
02:10:36,989 --> 02:10:40,510
Shut up.

1934
02:10:40,510 --> 02:10:42,510
Mr. S.

1935
02:10:42,510 --> 02:10:44,510
Jeff, you're an idiot, and you're a complete embarrassment to this family.

1936
02:10:49,630 --> 02:10:55,970
Look down.

1937
02:10:55,970 --> 02:10:59,039
Roger, do Roger.

1938
02:10:59,039 --> 02:11:01,039
Stan, I'm having some trouble with this, Stan.

1939
02:11:03,039 --> 02:11:05,039
Yeah, I'm gonna have to need you to get out of here, Stan.

1940
02:11:07,039 --> 02:11:10,500
Give me another one.

1941
02:11:10,500 --> 02:11:12,500
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1942
02:11:12,500 --> 02:11:19,979
Alright, alright.

1943
02:11:19,979 --> 02:11:21,979
Go, go, go.

1944
02:11:21,979 --> 02:11:24,350
The fish?

1945
02:11:24,350 --> 02:11:26,590
My name is Klaus, and I'm stuck in a bowl.

1946
02:11:26,590 --> 02:11:28,590
Patrick Stewart.

1947
02:11:28,590 --> 02:11:30,590
I'm Patrick Stewart, and I think that you deserve to be fired.

1948
02:11:30,590 --> 02:11:32,590
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

1949
02:11:32,590 --> 02:11:38,859
Barney.

1950
02:11:38,859 --> 02:11:40,859
I don't know, Barney from what?

1951
02:11:40,859 --> 02:11:42,859
Barney the dinosaur?

1952
02:11:42,859 --> 02:11:44,859
It's me, Barney.

1953
02:11:44,859 --> 02:11:46,859
Go, go, go, go.

1954
02:11:46,859 --> 02:11:54,079
Obama.

1955
02:11:54,079 --> 02:11:56,079
I think that we all need to come together.

1956
02:11:56,079 --> 02:11:58,079
To take care of this.

1957
02:11:58,079 --> 02:12:00,079
I will take care of that.

1958
02:12:00,079 --> 02:12:02,079
Don't worry about that.

1959
02:12:02,079 --> 02:12:10,260
Go, go, anymore.

1960
02:12:10,260 --> 02:12:12,260
Framer.

1961
02:12:12,260 --> 02:12:14,689
I'm gonna spell that.

1962
02:12:14,689 --> 02:12:18,460
Squidward.

1963
02:12:18,460 --> 02:12:20,460
Luigi.

1964
02:12:20,460 --> 02:12:24,220
Joe Biden.

1965
02:12:24,220 --> 02:12:26,829
Now look, here's the deal.

1966
02:12:26,829 --> 02:12:28,829
We are going to solve America.

1967
02:12:28,829 --> 02:12:30,829
Give me another one.

1968
02:12:30,829 --> 02:12:32,829
Not that one, not that one.

1969
02:12:32,829 --> 02:12:36,220
Tingle.

1970
02:12:36,220 --> 02:12:38,220
I've never played Zelda, I don't know what he sounds like.

1971
02:12:38,220 --> 02:12:40,220
Next one.

1972
02:12:40,220 --> 02:12:42,220
Marge.

1973
02:12:42,220 --> 02:12:45,739
Hercules.

1974
02:12:45,739 --> 02:12:47,739
Costanza.

1975
02:12:47,739 --> 02:12:49,739
Jerry.

1976
02:12:49,739 --> 02:12:52,939
Get going crazy here.

1977
02:12:52,939 --> 02:12:55,119
Meatwad.

1978
02:12:55,119 --> 02:12:57,119
I don't want to know, I just got away from it.

1979
02:12:57,119 --> 02:12:59,119
Homer.

1980
02:12:59,119 --> 02:13:01,119
It's me, Homer.

1981
02:13:01,119 --> 02:13:03,359
Shrek.

1982
02:13:03,359 --> 02:13:05,359
It's me, Shrek.

1983
02:13:05,359 --> 02:13:07,659
Cosmo and Wanda.

1984
02:13:07,659 --> 02:13:09,659
Okay, here's Cosmo.

1985
02:13:09,659 --> 02:13:11,899
Wanda.

1986
02:13:11,899 --> 02:13:14,340
Sans.

1987
02:13:14,340 --> 02:13:16,770
Donkey Kong.

1988
02:13:16,770 --> 02:13:22,529
Snake.

1989
02:13:22,529 --> 02:13:25,149
Al Gore.

1990
02:13:25,149 --> 02:13:27,149
The planet is under attack.

1991
02:13:27,149 --> 02:13:30,930
Kirby.

1992
02:13:30,930 --> 02:13:36,420
Trump.

1993
02:13:36,420 --> 02:13:38,420
Okay.

1994
02:13:38,420 --> 02:13:40,420
I didn't do anything wrong.

1995
02:13:40,420 --> 02:13:42,720
It's a fake media.

1996
02:13:42,720 --> 02:13:44,720
Megamind.

1997
02:13:44,720 --> 02:13:48,880
I don't know.

1998
02:13:48,880 --> 02:13:57,970
Dana White?

1999
02:13:57,970 --> 02:13:59,970
Like from UFC?

2000
02:13:59,970 --> 02:14:03,489
It's the tale of the tape.

2001
02:14:03,489 --> 02:14:05,489
We've got these two fighters.

2002
02:14:05,489 --> 02:14:07,489
Why do you want me to do a Dana White impression?

2003
02:14:07,489 --> 02:14:10,050
I don't get it, that doesn't make any sense.

2004
02:14:10,050 --> 02:14:17,859
It's just a normal guy talking.

2005
02:14:17,859 --> 02:14:20,350
Macho Man, got it.

2006
02:14:20,350 --> 02:14:22,350
I just want to...

2007
02:14:22,350 --> 02:14:24,779
Hold on, I'll get it.

2008
02:14:24,779 --> 02:14:26,779
Can you hear anything we're talking about, Minji?

2009
02:14:28,779 --> 02:14:30,779
I just want to say the cream of the crop.

2010
02:14:30,779 --> 02:14:32,779
Next.

2011
02:14:32,779 --> 02:14:34,779
Dr. Evil.

2012
02:14:36,779 --> 02:14:40,619
Alex Jones.

2013
02:14:44,619 --> 02:14:47,869
Mr. Krabs.

2014
02:14:49,869 --> 02:14:52,369
Kanye.

2015
02:14:52,369 --> 02:14:54,369
Hey!

2016
02:14:54,369 --> 02:14:56,369
I'm moving, I'm moving, I'm moving.

2017
02:14:58,369 --> 02:15:02,340
Joe Rogan.

2018
02:15:02,340 --> 02:15:06,420
Yeah.

2019
02:15:06,420 --> 02:15:10,109
Right, man.

2020
02:15:10,109 --> 02:15:13,310
Yeah.

2021
02:15:13,310 --> 02:15:15,310
Eric Cartman.

2022
02:15:15,310 --> 02:15:17,310
My name's Eric Cartman, I don't like you.

2023
02:15:17,310 --> 02:15:19,310
And hey, Kenny.

2024
02:15:19,310 --> 02:15:22,130
No, Kenny.

2025
02:15:22,130 --> 02:15:25,260
Wombus.

2026
02:15:25,260 --> 02:15:27,260
I only came here for Triffy.

2027
02:15:27,260 --> 02:15:29,260
Sometimes I wonder if she'd do the same for me.

2028
02:15:35,979 --> 02:15:38,670
Popeye.

2029
02:15:38,670 --> 02:15:40,670
Well, I am a cellular man.

2030
02:15:40,670 --> 02:15:42,670
I'm a cellular man.

2031
02:15:45,229 --> 02:15:47,229
The Medic.

2032
02:15:47,229 --> 02:15:49,539
Okay, people are going to leave, I have to stop.

2033
02:15:49,539 --> 02:15:56,770
Let's play the game.

2034
02:15:56,770 --> 02:15:59,970
This dude's going off.

2035
02:15:59,970 --> 02:16:04,579
You're dropping viewers.

2036
02:16:04,579 --> 02:16:06,579
Hey, we'll see you next week.

2037
02:16:06,579 --> 02:16:08,579
When they decide to come back after they're...

2038
02:16:08,579 --> 02:16:10,819
The ultimate small doses streamer.

2039
02:16:10,819 --> 02:16:14,909
Yeah, I peek in from time to time.

2040
02:16:14,909 --> 02:16:16,909
I have small doses, I can handle them.

2041
02:16:16,909 --> 02:16:22,539
All right, I gotta go find things to plant here.

2042
02:16:22,539 --> 02:16:29,010
Do Mr. Satan.

2043
02:16:29,010 --> 02:16:31,010
You guys already know my Mr. Satan.

2044
02:16:31,010 --> 02:16:33,010
I don't have to do it again.

2045
02:16:33,010 --> 02:16:35,010
Okay, excuse me.

2046
02:16:35,010 --> 02:16:37,010
You think you're not the strongest man in the world?

2047
02:16:37,010 --> 02:16:39,010
I'm the strongest man in the world, Goku.

2048
02:16:39,010 --> 02:16:41,010
And I'll take you on in a fight one on one.

2049
02:16:41,010 --> 02:16:43,010
You want to fight me one on one, Goku?

2050
02:16:43,010 --> 02:16:45,010
Come on at me.

2051
02:16:45,010 --> 02:16:47,010
Send him to hell.

2052
02:16:47,010 --> 02:16:56,290
Send who to hell?

2053
02:16:56,290 --> 02:16:59,680
I am not even playing the game.

2054
02:16:59,680 --> 02:17:01,680
I'm just stuck in the mirror.

2055
02:17:01,680 --> 02:17:03,680
This is what I do in the mirror.

2056
02:17:03,680 --> 02:17:05,680
I already get stuck like this

2057
02:17:05,680 --> 02:17:07,680
two or three times a day.

2058
02:17:07,680 --> 02:17:10,750
You put me in front of a mirror, I'm going to see myself

2059
02:17:10,750 --> 02:17:12,750
and go, oh, it's a person. Who's that?

2060
02:17:12,750 --> 02:17:14,750
Goku.

2061
02:17:14,750 --> 02:17:16,750
Don't put me in front of a mirror. I get trapped.

2062
02:17:16,750 --> 02:17:26,670
What do I do?

2063
02:17:26,670 --> 02:17:40,540
I need vegetables.

2064
02:17:40,540 --> 02:17:42,540
Wait, I can just get bugs. Let's get bugs.

2065
02:17:42,540 --> 02:17:44,540
All right, check this out.

2066
02:17:44,540 --> 02:17:50,930
I'm going to have you.

2067
02:17:50,930 --> 02:17:52,930
Hey, don't do that shit.

2068
02:17:52,930 --> 02:18:06,049
I'm going to donate six bugs to the ranch.

2069
02:18:06,049 --> 02:18:08,049
I'll just get them from here.

2070
02:18:08,049 --> 02:18:10,930
Do I not have a tool

2071
02:18:10,930 --> 02:18:12,930
that I can go in the air with?

2072
02:18:12,930 --> 02:18:15,620
I feel like it's been a while.

2073
02:18:15,620 --> 02:18:17,920
All right, let's get this bug. Ketchup bug.

2074
02:18:17,920 --> 02:18:21,229
I'll put that down there.

2075
02:18:21,229 --> 02:18:23,229
Get some ketchup, please. Thank you.

2076
02:18:23,229 --> 02:18:29,620
Let's get them. Do G-men and I'll...

2077
02:18:29,620 --> 02:18:31,620
Wait, do G-men and I'll give 100,000 subs.

2078
02:18:31,620 --> 02:18:34,049
Uh...

2079
02:18:34,049 --> 02:18:36,049
Mr. Freeman.

2080
02:18:36,049 --> 02:18:38,049
That's not right. That's the scientist.

2081
02:18:38,049 --> 02:18:40,049
Let me do it again.

2082
02:18:40,049 --> 02:18:42,049
The thing about that, Gordon,

2083
02:18:42,049 --> 02:18:44,049
you abandoned

2084
02:18:44,049 --> 02:18:46,049
the wrong place at the right time.

2085
02:18:46,049 --> 02:18:48,049
You could make all

2086
02:18:48,049 --> 02:18:50,049
the difference.

2087
02:18:50,049 --> 02:18:52,930
Open the briefcase, Gordon.

2088
02:18:52,930 --> 02:18:56,059
100,000 subs. Thank you.

2089
02:18:56,059 --> 02:19:07,709
You know, this is just

2090
02:19:07,709 --> 02:19:09,709
what I think would happen

2091
02:19:09,709 --> 02:19:11,709
when the really, really hyperactive

2092
02:19:11,709 --> 02:19:13,709
kid in Show and Tell didn't bring

2093
02:19:13,709 --> 02:19:15,709
anything to Show and Tell, and the teacher

2094
02:19:15,709 --> 02:19:17,709
just knows he's fucking out of

2095
02:19:17,709 --> 02:19:19,709
his mind. So they just go, you know

2096
02:19:19,709 --> 02:19:21,709
what? Okay, go ahead.

2097
02:19:21,709 --> 02:19:23,709
And I brought my impressions today.

2098
02:19:23,709 --> 02:19:26,209
And everyone just has to put up

2099
02:19:26,209 --> 02:19:28,209
with this for the five to ten

2100
02:19:28,209 --> 02:19:34,479
minutes that happens. What do you

2101
02:19:34,479 --> 02:19:36,479
like? Maybe I can lure you over with some

2102
02:19:36,479 --> 02:19:39,040
candy. Right?

2103
02:19:39,040 --> 02:19:41,340
Because it's a candy fly, and there's candy

2104
02:19:41,340 --> 02:19:43,520
here. Does the

2105
02:19:43,520 --> 02:19:45,520
candy fly like candy?

2106
02:19:45,520 --> 02:19:52,670
That would make sense, right?

2107
02:19:52,670 --> 02:19:54,979
What do you like, though? Don't be a

2108
02:19:54,979 --> 02:19:57,860
sucker. What do you like? You don't have

2109
02:19:57,860 --> 02:20:00,610
any likes or dislikes.

2110
02:20:00,610 --> 02:20:04,899
Come on. Hey, Phallus extends to the five

2111
02:20:04,899 --> 02:20:06,899
community subs. A little short of 100,000,

2112
02:20:06,899 --> 02:20:08,899
but, you know, we make bets here that we don't go through

2113
02:20:08,899 --> 02:20:11,459
with. Like me?

2114
02:20:11,459 --> 02:20:14,340
Like you? I need two hamburgers

2115
02:20:14,340 --> 02:20:17,219
to fight each other. I can do that.

2116
02:20:17,219 --> 02:20:19,389
Come here.

2117
02:20:19,389 --> 02:20:22,260
Hamburger. You.

2118
02:20:22,260 --> 02:20:31,459
Follow. Oh, alright, come on.

2119
02:20:31,459 --> 02:20:33,889
Come on, Bunger.

2120
02:20:33,889 --> 02:20:36,260
Bunger! Nice sick, nice sick,

2121
02:20:36,260 --> 02:20:39,459
sick, sick, nice sick.

2122
02:20:39,459 --> 02:20:46,239
Any more Bungers? You owe us the dump

2123
02:20:46,239 --> 02:20:51,420
truck emote. I don't know, I don't.

2124
02:20:51,420 --> 02:20:53,659
Maybe eventually you'll get it if you behave.

2125
02:20:53,659 --> 02:20:59,940
Well, I have four. Let me just go

2126
02:20:59,940 --> 02:21:08,260
back and donate these.

2127
02:21:08,260 --> 02:21:10,690
You told us three new emotes.

2128
02:21:10,690 --> 02:21:12,690
Yeah, like within the next seven to ten days,

2129
02:21:12,690 --> 02:21:15,379
it's been like five. I got plenty

2130
02:21:15,379 --> 02:21:31,059
of time. Meanyworm.

2131
02:21:31,059 --> 02:21:33,360
Oh, wait, here's a fruit.

2132
02:21:33,360 --> 02:21:36,159
Get back there, because then I can plant

2133
02:21:36,159 --> 02:21:38,159
the fruit and then I need a carrot.

2134
02:21:38,159 --> 02:21:40,459
Can I actually

2135
02:21:40,459 --> 02:21:45,329
plant the french fries? Does that not work?

2136
02:21:45,329 --> 02:21:49,040
Four part dump truck ass

2137
02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:51,790
emote. I'm gonna get kicked off

2138
02:21:51,790 --> 02:21:58,190
a twitch. Baku tail, thanks

2139
02:21:58,190 --> 02:22:00,190
to the five. No, six community subs, actually.

2140
02:22:00,190 --> 02:22:06,209
I read that wrong.

2141
02:22:06,209 --> 02:22:08,209
I don't think I've even been to Flavor Falls.

2142
02:22:08,209 --> 02:22:11,790
Got that. Yeah, that's a good olive.

2143
02:22:11,790 --> 02:22:16,399
Holy shit. What

2144
02:22:16,399 --> 02:22:18,399
the hell is that? It's a sub sandwich?

2145
02:22:18,399 --> 02:22:23,780
That's my favorite.

2146
02:22:23,780 --> 02:22:26,079
I love them. How do

2147
02:22:26,079 --> 02:22:28,079
I get a sandwich bug thing?

2148
02:22:28,079 --> 02:22:30,510
How do I get the Super Bowl party

2149
02:22:30,510 --> 02:22:34,219
sandwich? What is that?

2150
02:22:34,219 --> 02:22:38,500
A veggie bit. No,

2151
02:22:38,500 --> 02:22:40,500
you. A white rootle. Oh,

2152
02:22:40,500 --> 02:22:42,989
shit. Alright, hold on. I have to

2153
02:22:42,989 --> 02:22:47,469
release some of these. I have too many

2154
02:22:47,469 --> 02:22:51,569
french fries. Release. Hey.

2155
02:22:51,569 --> 02:22:57,379
Release you. Go to the farm.

2156
02:22:57,379 --> 02:22:59,809
Yeah, I want to catch this

2157
02:22:59,809 --> 02:23:01,809
one, because that's a veggie.

2158
02:23:01,809 --> 02:23:13,250
This game is really cute.

2159
02:23:13,250 --> 02:23:15,250
There's my vegetable. There's my

2160
02:23:15,250 --> 02:23:18,829
loves.

2161
02:23:18,829 --> 02:23:22,030
Speeds along crashing into things.

2162
02:23:22,030 --> 02:23:24,030
It won't slow down until it's broken up.

2163
02:23:24,030 --> 02:23:27,739
What is it? Love? Orange

2164
02:23:27,739 --> 02:23:34,139
juice? I'll come back for you.

2165
02:23:34,139 --> 02:23:39,569
Is that a pretzel?

2166
02:23:39,569 --> 02:23:41,569
What is it? Tasty, twisty snack

2167
02:23:41,569 --> 02:23:43,569
pod? What?

2168
02:23:43,569 --> 02:23:47,260
Alright, get rid of the french fries.

2169
02:23:47,260 --> 02:23:49,260
Another ten community subs.

2170
02:23:49,260 --> 02:23:53,360
It's just a bag of chips, but it's

2171
02:23:53,360 --> 02:23:56,299
alive. What?

2172
02:23:56,299 --> 02:24:00,579
Uh, Flutter.

2173
02:24:00,579 --> 02:24:03,520
Looter, thanks for the ten community subs.

2174
02:24:03,520 --> 02:24:05,889
Alright, I gotta deliver these. I missed other subs,

2175
02:24:05,889 --> 02:24:12,860
did I? Oh, shit, we had a lot.

2176
02:24:12,860 --> 02:24:14,860
Ah, we did, right. Felsix gave five.

2177
02:24:14,860 --> 02:24:18,700
Jubelube

2178
02:24:18,700 --> 02:24:20,700
Tube gave five.

2179
02:24:20,700 --> 02:24:23,649
And then Captain Nemo gave a hundred bucks.

2180
02:24:23,649 --> 02:24:25,649
Thanks for the ten thousand bits.

2181
02:24:25,649 --> 02:24:27,649
This is huge money today. There's been like

2182
02:24:27,649 --> 02:24:29,649
three or four of these.

2183
02:24:29,649 --> 02:24:32,850
Too much money. And Captain Nemo

2184
02:24:32,850 --> 02:24:34,850
says dump truck emote tomorrow,

2185
02:24:34,850 --> 02:24:36,850
or I will freeze this card before it goes

2186
02:24:36,850 --> 02:24:38,850
through. Uh, well, I don't...

2187
02:24:38,850 --> 02:24:42,299
Well, you're gonna be getting...

2188
02:24:42,299 --> 02:24:45,309
You're gonna be hearing from your bank. Cause I don't think

2189
02:24:45,309 --> 02:24:57,729
it's gonna be here tomorrow.

2190
02:24:57,729 --> 02:25:00,420
I'm gonna freeze my card.

2191
02:25:00,420 --> 02:25:02,420
Yes, this is uh, this is bank.

2192
02:25:02,420 --> 02:25:04,909
I'm gonna help you. I'd like to

2193
02:25:04,909 --> 02:25:06,909
freeze my credit card. I'd like to report a

2194
02:25:06,909 --> 02:25:08,909
freeze of the purchase that just happened.

2195
02:25:08,909 --> 02:25:11,149
And what purchase would that be?

2196
02:25:11,149 --> 02:25:13,329
A hundred dollars to an e-clown.

2197
02:25:13,329 --> 02:25:15,950
Oh, you didn't make that purchase?

2198
02:25:15,950 --> 02:25:18,770
No. You didn't, cause you confirmed it

2199
02:25:18,770 --> 02:25:20,940
twice. No, um,

2200
02:25:20,940 --> 02:25:23,309
I did, but he

2201
02:25:23,309 --> 02:25:25,309
said he wasn't gonna make a German ass

2202
02:25:25,309 --> 02:25:27,309
dump truck emote, so

2203
02:25:27,309 --> 02:25:31,600
I have to refund it. Okay.

2204
02:25:31,600 --> 02:25:33,600
Um, no.

2205
02:25:33,600 --> 02:25:36,989
I'm switching banks. I'm switching

2206
02:25:36,989 --> 02:25:38,989
banks. Bullshit, I'm switching banks.

2207
02:25:38,989 --> 02:25:49,409
Cool.

2208
02:25:49,409 --> 02:25:53,629
I planted the snacks.

2209
02:25:59,139 --> 02:26:01,139
He's destroying... No, I'm not.

2210
02:26:01,139 --> 02:26:04,590
Wait, I have some more stuff.

2211
02:26:04,590 --> 02:26:06,590
Alright, you eat. What about this pretzel snack pod?

2212
02:26:10,180 --> 02:26:13,950
I did this stuff in the lunchroom

2213
02:26:13,950 --> 02:26:16,190
in like the fourth grade.

2214
02:26:16,190 --> 02:26:18,190
You put the pretzel sticks in your mouth and you go

2215
02:26:18,190 --> 02:26:20,940
Alright, what about burger?

2216
02:26:20,940 --> 02:26:24,000
Nice.

2217
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:30,209
Donate. Oh, right, you're right, right, right, right, right.

2218
02:26:30,209 --> 02:26:36,030
Donate you.

2219
02:26:36,030 --> 02:26:38,590
Donate Dr. Soda.

2220
02:26:38,590 --> 02:26:40,590
Oh, look! They actually come out and

2221
02:26:40,590 --> 02:26:45,840
play. I love this

2222
02:26:45,840 --> 02:26:50,190
guy. Is it weird that

2223
02:26:50,190 --> 02:26:52,190
this part of my brain sees this as

2224
02:26:52,190 --> 02:26:54,190
some weird post-apocalyptic

2225
02:26:54,190 --> 02:27:03,920
polluted earth shit?

2226
02:27:03,920 --> 02:27:11,020
This is gonna be real.

2227
02:27:11,020 --> 02:27:13,020
I don't like looking at that anymore. Alright.

2228
02:27:13,020 --> 02:27:15,020
I need four more snacks.

2229
02:27:15,020 --> 02:27:18,799
Hey, don't annoy me.

2230
02:27:23,920 --> 02:27:25,920
And we're voting you off the island.

2231
02:27:25,920 --> 02:27:27,920
What do you mean personal issues?

2232
02:27:39,100 --> 02:27:41,100
What do you mean personal issues?

2233
02:27:45,579 --> 02:27:50,700
Aren't I doing that already?

2234
02:27:50,700 --> 02:27:52,700
I was gonna just try to do a millhouse from

2235
02:27:52,700 --> 02:27:54,700
Simpson's voice, but that would be way too hard.

2236
02:27:54,700 --> 02:28:07,549
Following me?

2237
02:28:07,549 --> 02:28:09,549
I still gotta get some more.

2238
02:28:09,549 --> 02:28:11,549
You have something that's... Wait, interview.

2239
02:28:13,549 --> 02:28:15,549
Bilbo gave you...

2240
02:28:15,549 --> 02:28:20,219
That's the fucking bugs.

2241
02:28:20,219 --> 02:28:22,219
Holy shit. I don't know if you could even...

2242
02:28:22,219 --> 02:28:24,219
Hold on.

2243
02:28:26,219 --> 02:28:30,059
What do you do professionally though?

2244
02:28:42,219 --> 02:28:44,219
Is this a spy?

2245
02:28:44,219 --> 02:28:47,360
Is that fun fact unrelated?

2246
02:28:51,360 --> 02:28:53,360
Oh.

2247
02:29:01,010 --> 02:29:03,010
Oh shit, I ain't even recording.

2248
02:29:03,010 --> 02:29:05,569
Oh well, she won't even fucking notice.

2249
02:29:05,569 --> 02:29:07,569
I'm not even recording.

2250
02:29:16,540 --> 02:29:18,540
Drama? Oh my god.

2251
02:29:18,540 --> 02:29:20,540
Feed me.

2252
02:29:32,100 --> 02:29:34,100
So you're an international criminal

2253
02:29:34,100 --> 02:29:36,100
and you steal from the farmer.

2254
02:29:36,100 --> 02:29:40,770
That's a grade A awful.

2255
02:29:52,770 --> 02:29:56,350
Where's Lizbert?

2256
02:29:56,350 --> 02:29:58,350
Tell me.

2257
02:30:01,420 --> 02:30:05,069
You wanna go to jail?

2258
02:30:09,069 --> 02:30:11,069
What is it?

2259
02:30:17,379 --> 02:30:19,940
What is it?

2260
02:30:19,940 --> 02:30:22,750
Hamburger bug snacks.

2261
02:30:27,379 --> 02:30:29,379
That's everybody's weakness though.

2262
02:30:29,379 --> 02:30:31,379
I don't buy that.

2263
02:30:31,379 --> 02:30:33,379
Uh oh.

2264
02:30:44,670 --> 02:30:46,670
Egobel, suspicious.

2265
02:30:46,670 --> 02:30:48,670
Egobel,

2266
02:30:48,670 --> 02:30:50,670
you could shorten that a little

2267
02:30:50,670 --> 02:30:52,670
and say something about how suspicious

2268
02:30:52,670 --> 02:30:54,670
Egobel is.

2269
02:31:01,260 --> 02:31:03,260
Oh, I have a key.

2270
02:31:03,260 --> 02:31:05,260
I have two keys.

2271
02:31:08,979 --> 02:31:11,280
Alright, so I have two.

2272
02:31:11,280 --> 02:31:13,280
Let me try to open that door.

2273
02:31:13,280 --> 02:31:19,469
Walking my way out.

2274
02:31:19,469 --> 02:31:23,309
Fine, I'll just barrel through.

2275
02:31:23,309 --> 02:31:25,309
Where's this little cabin somewhere?

2276
02:31:25,309 --> 02:31:31,840
Wait, what's this way? This is like a desert.

2277
02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:36,110
We're gonna get some desert bugs?

2278
02:31:36,110 --> 02:31:43,340
Wrong way?

2279
02:31:43,340 --> 02:31:45,340
Yeah, I haven't seen anything over here.

2280
02:31:45,340 --> 02:31:55,389
Scorched gorge.

2281
02:31:55,389 --> 02:31:57,389
Oh, it's a chili pepper, a scorpeno.

2282
02:31:57,389 --> 02:32:02,379
The snack wabs fiery peppers

2283
02:32:02,379 --> 02:32:04,379
at anything that catches its attention.

2284
02:32:04,379 --> 02:32:09,569
I like that one.

2285
02:32:09,569 --> 02:32:11,569
What's that thing?

2286
02:32:11,569 --> 02:32:13,569
Weird.

2287
02:32:13,569 --> 02:32:15,569
A pop tick. They are too small to catch in a trap

2288
02:32:15,569 --> 02:32:18,190
but maybe some heat will puff them up.

2289
02:32:18,190 --> 02:32:20,190
Alright, hold on. What about you?

2290
02:32:20,190 --> 02:32:22,559
What does a scorpeno like?

2291
02:32:22,559 --> 02:32:24,989
Loves? What's the orange thing?

2292
02:32:24,989 --> 02:32:29,469
So I can have them kind of pop the popcorns.

2293
02:32:29,469 --> 02:32:32,989
It's mustard?

2294
02:32:32,989 --> 02:32:41,360
Why do you get mustard?

2295
02:32:41,360 --> 02:32:43,360
What's that? A spuddy.

2296
02:32:43,360 --> 02:32:45,360
It protects its territory by charging intruders

2297
02:32:45,360 --> 02:32:47,360
with its powerful jaws.

2298
02:32:47,360 --> 02:32:49,360
It loves ketchup.

2299
02:32:49,360 --> 02:32:51,540
Let's catch this motherfucker.

2300
02:32:51,540 --> 02:33:00,479
Is it too big?

2301
02:33:00,479 --> 02:33:04,319
We got a good link. Hold on.

2302
02:33:04,319 --> 02:33:08,459
It's too big.

2303
02:33:08,459 --> 02:33:10,770
He just smashed into the wall.

2304
02:33:10,770 --> 02:33:18,690
Do that again.

2305
02:33:18,690 --> 02:33:24,579
Whoa, whoa! There's a secret in here!

2306
02:33:24,579 --> 02:33:27,709
What the hell is this?

2307
02:33:27,709 --> 02:33:35,899
A mural depicts grumpuses opening a section

2308
02:33:35,899 --> 02:33:37,899
of wall near the river there carrying

2309
02:33:37,899 --> 02:33:41,870
some sort of parcel.

2310
02:33:41,870 --> 02:33:45,969
That's the pizza demon that we saw earlier.

2311
02:33:45,969 --> 02:33:52,049
It's Laura. Secret Laura.

2312
02:33:52,049 --> 02:33:57,620
We got a quest over here.

2313
02:33:57,620 --> 02:34:01,840
Oh my god, it's like a rib.

2314
02:34:01,840 --> 02:34:08,540
Ribble.

2315
02:34:08,540 --> 02:34:11,680
Ribble-pede.

2316
02:34:11,680 --> 02:34:13,680
It likes to hide and sit still. Maybe some sauce

2317
02:34:13,680 --> 02:34:16,110
could get it to move.

2318
02:34:16,110 --> 02:34:18,420
Like barbecue sauce?

2319
02:34:18,420 --> 02:34:26,989
Will you fucking leave me alone?

2320
02:34:26,989 --> 02:34:34,420
You like ketchup?

2321
02:34:34,420 --> 02:34:40,690
Oh, I covered him in ketchup and he hated it.

2322
02:34:40,690 --> 02:34:43,889
I got a ribble-pede.

2323
02:34:43,889 --> 02:34:46,260
How do I stop you from doing this?

2324
02:34:46,260 --> 02:34:56,299
What am I supposed to do with you?

2325
02:34:56,299 --> 02:35:02,000
He's covered in ketchup. Does it make him mad?

2326
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,940
There's a butterfly up there. Hold on.

2327
02:35:04,940 --> 02:35:08,139
Oh, it's Tiffany. Everyone talks shit about you.

2328
02:35:14,139 --> 02:35:16,139
Hit the bug. Wait, wait, hold on.

2329
02:35:22,579 --> 02:35:30,899
Hold on. Somebody got a link.

2330
02:35:30,899 --> 02:35:35,180
That's a good one. This one's not bad.

2331
02:35:35,180 --> 02:35:44,079
It's not bad. It's pretty good.

2332
02:35:44,079 --> 02:35:49,139
I don't know if I love chocolate though.

2333
02:35:49,139 --> 02:35:51,629
I like chocolate. I don't know if I love chocolate.

2334
02:36:13,629 --> 02:36:15,629
Ooh, I got one of those.

2335
02:36:19,629 --> 02:36:21,629
Ooh, how many do you want? Three?

2336
02:36:21,629 --> 02:36:23,629
I can do that.

2337
02:36:23,629 --> 02:36:25,629
Let's go.

2338
02:36:25,629 --> 02:36:27,629
I wanted to get people to come back to town.

2339
02:36:27,629 --> 02:36:29,629
Alright, ribble-pedes.

2340
02:36:29,629 --> 02:36:33,409
There's one right there. What's your trajectory?

2341
02:36:33,409 --> 02:36:35,409
Alright, that's the trajectory.

2342
02:36:35,409 --> 02:36:38,340
Get that shit down. Let's go.

2343
02:36:38,340 --> 02:36:40,340
Toss him up.

2344
02:36:40,340 --> 02:36:42,639
Where'd you go?

2345
02:36:42,639 --> 02:36:51,780
Oh wait, you went all the way around.

2346
02:36:51,780 --> 02:36:55,680
Really strange path you have.

2347
02:36:55,680 --> 02:36:57,680
Alright, one more.

2348
02:36:57,680 --> 02:37:02,209
I like the voice.

2349
02:37:02,209 --> 02:37:04,700
I like the voice.

2350
02:37:04,700 --> 02:37:08,930
I can't wait for the one that's like

2351
02:37:08,930 --> 02:37:10,930
ribble-peded.

2352
02:37:10,930 --> 02:37:17,260
That will be my favorite.

2353
02:37:24,860 --> 02:37:26,860
Okay, every goblin from

2354
02:37:26,860 --> 02:37:28,860
Warcraft and Hearthstone.

2355
02:37:28,860 --> 02:37:32,829
Where do you want me to go? Who is this talking?

2356
02:37:32,829 --> 02:37:43,889
Oh, it's you.

2357
02:37:43,889 --> 02:37:46,700
Wait, a white cheepoof.

2358
02:37:46,700 --> 02:37:48,700
It's a cheese puff.

2359
02:37:48,700 --> 02:37:52,100
You're annoying. Stop doing that.

2360
02:37:52,100 --> 02:37:56,319
Danny DeVito? That would be great.

2361
02:37:56,319 --> 02:37:59,649
Wait, my ball.

2362
02:37:59,649 --> 02:38:01,649
Oh man, I left the ball all the way back there.

2363
02:38:01,649 --> 02:38:03,649
I'm a bad father.

2364
02:38:03,649 --> 02:38:05,649
Come on, I'm back. Wait, he loves this.

2365
02:38:05,649 --> 02:38:10,180
He loves that.

2366
02:38:10,180 --> 02:38:16,379
What do I do with that information?

2367
02:38:16,379 --> 02:38:18,379
Hmm, what does it say?

2368
02:38:18,379 --> 02:38:20,940
Some assembly required. Buy at your own risk.

2369
02:38:20,940 --> 02:38:24,270
All sales are final.

2370
02:38:24,270 --> 02:38:26,270
Offer void where prohibited. Shirt and shoes optional.

2371
02:38:26,270 --> 02:38:28,270
May contain nuts or shellfish. Guarantees not guaranteed.

2372
02:38:28,270 --> 02:38:30,270
Bridge for sale.

2373
02:38:30,270 --> 02:38:35,379
Did you make it up?

2374
02:38:35,379 --> 02:38:38,190
I thought he was covered in blood for a second.

2375
02:38:38,190 --> 02:38:41,329
Oh, what a journey you were on.

2376
02:38:41,329 --> 02:38:45,489
Get away from me. Actually, you know what?

2377
02:38:45,489 --> 02:38:48,180
Come over here. Get over here.

2378
02:38:48,180 --> 02:38:52,399
Come light me up.

2379
02:38:52,399 --> 02:38:54,899
Do that over here.

2380
02:38:54,899 --> 02:38:58,670
Okay, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.

2381
02:38:58,670 --> 02:39:02,260
Pop over here. Pop over here.

2382
02:39:02,260 --> 02:39:04,260
Oh, it's a popcorn! Go, go, go, over here.

2383
02:39:04,260 --> 02:39:06,260
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2384
02:39:06,260 --> 02:39:08,260
Wait, okay, that's awesome. It's a live popcorn.

2385
02:39:08,260 --> 02:39:10,500
I love it. Give me this back.

2386
02:39:10,500 --> 02:39:20,780
Yes. A pop tick.

2387
02:39:20,780 --> 02:39:27,489
Nice.

2388
02:39:27,489 --> 02:39:30,299
Alright, hold on. I gotta pee again.

2389
02:39:30,299 --> 02:39:31,620
Piss day, for some reason.

2390
02:39:31,620 --> 02:42:39,059
I'll be right back.

2391
02:42:39,059 --> 02:42:40,459
Who's ready to snack?

2392
02:42:46,389 --> 02:42:48,270
Okay.

2393
02:42:48,270 --> 02:42:49,870
Oh, did I not even put it on the VRB screen?

2394
02:42:49,870 --> 02:42:51,510
I just walked away.

2395
02:42:51,510 --> 02:42:53,260
Shit.

2396
02:42:53,260 --> 02:42:55,250
I thought I did.

2397
02:42:55,250 --> 02:42:57,799
I didn't even switch it.

2398
02:42:57,799 --> 02:42:59,110
Whoops.

2399
02:42:59,110 --> 02:43:03,260
All right, we need one more Ribble pea.

2400
02:43:03,260 --> 02:43:04,680
I got the popcorn one, so that's good.

2401
02:43:04,680 --> 02:43:07,340
I'm happy about that.

2402
02:43:07,340 --> 02:43:10,360
All right, they're in the ruins, the ancient ruins.

2403
02:43:14,069 --> 02:43:15,979
We got the one in here.

2404
02:43:15,979 --> 02:43:17,690
What about the one over here?

2405
02:43:17,729 --> 02:43:19,209
Is there more than one in here?

2406
02:43:19,209 --> 02:43:24,059
Yep.

2407
02:43:24,059 --> 02:43:25,020
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey.

2408
02:43:25,020 --> 02:43:26,700
What was the name of that game

2409
02:43:26,700 --> 02:43:28,340
that everybody told me to play?

2410
02:43:28,340 --> 02:43:30,940
That was the photography game.

2411
02:43:30,940 --> 02:43:33,450
Have we played that game, Africa?

2412
02:43:33,450 --> 02:43:38,260
I completely forgot the name of the game.

2413
02:43:38,260 --> 02:43:42,659
No, no, no, it's, it's, it's, it's some, it's a,

2414
02:43:42,659 --> 02:43:43,940
it's like, oh, he loves taking pictures.

2415
02:43:43,940 --> 02:43:46,420
It's a picture of a take photos game.

2416
02:43:46,420 --> 02:43:50,260
No, not Dragon Rampa, something else.

2417
02:43:50,260 --> 02:43:54,000
It's like, no, not Pokemon Snap.

2418
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:58,760
No, no, no, no.

2419
02:43:58,760 --> 02:44:00,200
No, no, no, no, no, not horror.

2420
02:44:00,200 --> 02:44:02,239
It's, it's like a,

2421
02:44:02,280 --> 02:44:03,399
the color scheme is like this.

2422
02:44:03,399 --> 02:44:04,239
It looks like this.

2423
02:44:04,239 --> 02:44:07,200
The color scheme is like pink, teal, and electrified.

2424
02:44:07,200 --> 02:44:11,610
And it has a Uru, Uru Gami Generation.

2425
02:44:11,610 --> 02:44:12,450
That's the one, right?

2426
02:44:12,450 --> 02:44:15,579
That's it.

2427
02:44:15,579 --> 02:44:18,579
Uru Ga, or Uru Gami Generation.

2428
02:44:18,579 --> 02:44:21,430
All right, is that game any good?

2429
02:44:21,430 --> 02:44:22,709
Did I play that game?

2430
02:44:22,709 --> 02:44:23,549
People kept telling me it was like the,

2431
02:44:23,549 --> 02:44:31,020
it was a photo game.

2432
02:44:31,020 --> 02:44:32,860
You have to play Dragon Rampa.

2433
02:44:32,860 --> 02:44:36,030
I probably won't.

2434
02:44:36,030 --> 02:44:41,549
All right, let's go back and deliver.

2435
02:44:41,549 --> 02:44:43,829
Uh, wait, do you want to eat these?

2436
02:44:43,829 --> 02:44:45,739
Have a good one.

2437
02:44:45,739 --> 02:44:49,030
You want, you want to eat these?

2438
02:44:49,030 --> 02:44:50,629
I thought you wanted to study them.

2439
02:44:55,579 --> 02:44:57,340
This just looks like you,

2440
02:44:57,340 --> 02:45:04,850
you got your arms and legs cut off.

2441
02:45:04,850 --> 02:45:08,889
Yes, Rivelpedes only look like they have bones.

2442
02:45:08,889 --> 02:45:12,040
They're squishy all the way through.

2443
02:45:12,040 --> 02:45:15,399
So what did these fellas eat then?

2444
02:45:15,399 --> 02:45:18,280
Well, like grandma always said,

2445
02:45:18,280 --> 02:45:21,280
if you want answers, dig through their sock drawer.

2446
02:45:21,280 --> 02:45:23,719
I want to get into that dwelling over there,

2447
02:45:23,719 --> 02:45:25,079
but the door's blocked up.

2448
02:45:25,079 --> 02:45:25,920
I already opened it.

2449
02:45:25,920 --> 02:45:28,319
If you could do something to get that door open.

2450
02:45:28,360 --> 02:45:29,200
I'll go in.

2451
02:45:29,200 --> 02:45:31,000
I opened it accidentally.

2452
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,520
I'm like Mr. Magood into the ruins.

2453
02:45:33,520 --> 02:45:34,479
So go ahead.

2454
02:45:44,180 --> 02:45:47,100
What the fuck are you going to do about it?

2455
02:45:47,100 --> 02:45:48,379
Oh, look at me, I can charge.

2456
02:45:48,379 --> 02:45:50,139
Look at me, I'm so fast.

2457
02:45:50,139 --> 02:45:52,020
Yeah, what are you going to do?

2458
02:45:52,020 --> 02:45:52,860
Ha ha ha.

2459
02:45:52,860 --> 02:45:53,700
Ha ha ha.

2460
02:45:59,139 --> 02:46:00,500
Get out.

2461
02:46:00,500 --> 02:46:03,260
These murals are still preserved.

2462
02:46:03,260 --> 02:46:04,659
As far as I know,

2463
02:46:04,659 --> 02:46:07,579
we were the first grumps to settle this island.

2464
02:46:07,579 --> 02:46:10,219
But here we got a thousand years of history

2465
02:46:10,219 --> 02:46:11,059
and accounted for.

2466
02:46:11,059 --> 02:46:12,459
There were a thousand grumps before us.

2467
02:46:12,459 --> 02:46:16,340
Generations of grumpuses who hunted and ate bug snacks.

2468
02:46:16,340 --> 02:46:19,979
Just a cosmic reminder that nothing really lasts, eh?

2469
02:46:19,979 --> 02:46:20,819
Bug snacks.

2470
02:46:20,819 --> 02:46:21,659
What's this?

2471
02:46:21,659 --> 02:46:25,020
Looks like there's a hidden chamber somewhere in the canyon.

2472
02:46:25,020 --> 02:46:27,940
Could that be where they stored bug snacks?

2473
02:46:27,940 --> 02:46:30,299
Would you mind finding that chamber?

2474
02:46:30,299 --> 02:46:32,459
And if there's bug snacks there,

2475
02:46:32,459 --> 02:46:34,059
please bring them to me.

2476
02:46:34,059 --> 02:46:35,379
Bye bye.

2477
02:46:35,379 --> 02:46:36,860
Find and enter the hidden ruins.

2478
02:46:36,860 --> 02:46:38,459
How am I supposed to do that?

2479
02:46:41,420 --> 02:46:45,329
That's not a whole lot of info.

2480
02:46:45,329 --> 02:46:47,969
Opening a section of wall near the river.

2481
02:46:47,969 --> 02:46:49,049
They're carrying a parcel.

2482
02:46:49,049 --> 02:46:50,649
Section of wall near the river.

2483
02:46:51,569 --> 02:46:59,540
Okay, let's go find it.

2484
02:46:59,540 --> 02:47:04,219
Find a river.

2485
02:47:04,219 --> 02:47:07,190
Scan the moth painting.

2486
02:47:07,190 --> 02:47:09,629
Oh, I'm so, I'm so sorry.

2487
02:47:09,629 --> 02:47:17,819
I'm so sorry.

2488
02:47:17,860 --> 02:47:26,340
I already did.

2489
02:47:26,340 --> 02:47:27,180
Donate the popcorn?

2490
02:47:27,180 --> 02:47:28,739
I will once I find the hidden ruins

2491
02:47:28,739 --> 02:47:32,459
and do this for Green Grover.

2492
02:47:32,459 --> 02:47:35,680
All right, hidden, here's the river.

2493
02:47:35,680 --> 02:47:37,959
Is the arrow pointing me to where the, no.

2494
02:47:37,959 --> 02:47:39,760
All right, there's a section of this wall

2495
02:47:39,760 --> 02:47:41,239
somewhere over here.

2496
02:47:41,239 --> 02:47:44,899
It needs to be, it's probably right there.

2497
02:47:44,899 --> 02:47:54,270
You, I need you to run at me really fast.

2498
02:47:54,270 --> 02:47:57,270
Come over here.

2499
02:47:57,270 --> 02:47:58,829
Hey, don't you like sauce?

2500
02:47:58,829 --> 02:47:59,670
I got lots of sauce.

2501
02:47:59,670 --> 02:48:08,120
I got lots of red sauce inside of my body.

2502
02:48:08,120 --> 02:48:09,299
What's wrong?

2503
02:48:09,299 --> 02:48:13,229
Wait, let me just double check.

2504
02:48:14,729 --> 02:48:15,569
Near the river.

2505
02:48:15,569 --> 02:48:20,120
Ah, I found it.

2506
02:48:20,120 --> 02:48:23,600
Right here.

2507
02:48:23,600 --> 02:48:24,440
Look at me.

2508
02:48:24,440 --> 02:48:27,840
I'm covered in sauce.

2509
02:48:27,840 --> 02:48:32,280
Oh, whoa, whoa.

2510
02:48:32,280 --> 02:48:45,940
Okay, no, nobody, I can't get the door open now.

2511
02:48:45,940 --> 02:48:47,860
I'll get, hold on, I'll get another one.

2512
02:48:47,860 --> 02:48:56,010
There's one back here, right?

2513
02:48:56,010 --> 02:49:00,559
Just cover the ball in sauce and it'll follow me around.

2514
02:49:00,559 --> 02:49:08,239
There you go, okay, cover this ball in sauce.

2515
02:49:08,239 --> 02:49:14,379
Follow me.

2516
02:49:14,379 --> 02:49:15,459
Wait, there's another popcorn.

2517
02:49:15,459 --> 02:49:20,520
Am I gonna die?

2518
02:49:20,520 --> 02:49:25,379
You shithead.

2519
02:49:25,379 --> 02:49:26,420
Come over here.

2520
02:49:26,420 --> 02:49:28,579
No.

2521
02:49:28,579 --> 02:49:30,979
Whatever, I don't need another popcorn, I don't care.

2522
02:49:30,979 --> 02:49:34,819
Give me this back.

2523
02:49:34,819 --> 02:49:36,350
Where'd he go?

2524
02:49:36,350 --> 02:49:38,229
Where's my, where is he, where is he?

2525
02:49:40,850 --> 02:49:43,559
Where'd he go?

2526
02:49:43,559 --> 02:49:45,360
Crying, Jerma, I'm sorry that you're crying.

2527
02:49:45,360 --> 02:49:47,180
What happened?

2528
02:49:47,180 --> 02:49:52,549
Where did that guy go?

2529
02:49:52,549 --> 02:50:00,770
Where did he go?

2530
02:50:00,770 --> 02:50:01,770
Am I insane?

2531
02:50:01,770 --> 02:50:04,309
Where did he go?

2532
02:50:04,309 --> 02:50:11,360
Oh, you went all the way down here, perfect, okay.

2533
02:50:11,360 --> 02:50:16,170
Keep going.

2534
02:50:16,170 --> 02:50:20,450
No, no, no, no, no, no, follow me.

2535
02:50:20,450 --> 02:50:34,709
No, no, no, no, please.

2536
02:50:34,709 --> 02:50:36,049
Break it.

2537
02:50:36,049 --> 02:50:40,389
Yeah, now get out of here.

2538
02:50:40,950 --> 02:50:42,430
Is that extra dogs?

2539
02:50:42,430 --> 02:50:43,629
What are those?

2540
02:50:43,629 --> 02:50:44,549
Now you're in here with me

2541
02:50:44,549 --> 02:50:48,930
and I don't want you in here with me.

2542
02:50:48,930 --> 02:50:53,510
Catch one weenie worm.

2543
02:50:53,510 --> 02:50:54,709
What do you like?

2544
02:50:54,709 --> 02:50:58,170
Oh, you're very dirty.

2545
02:50:58,170 --> 02:51:01,459
It's only motivated by its hatred of ketchup.

2546
02:51:01,459 --> 02:51:03,659
Okay, well, you don't like ketchup, then I'm sorry,

2547
02:51:03,659 --> 02:51:08,760
but why don't you get away from that?

2548
02:51:08,760 --> 02:51:09,840
Oh, you don't like ketchup.

2549
02:51:09,840 --> 02:51:11,280
Oh, shit.

2550
02:51:11,280 --> 02:51:14,520
Wait a minute, I just covered him with,

2551
02:51:14,520 --> 02:51:19,329
why did he just get big and red?

2552
02:51:19,329 --> 02:51:31,250
He got big and red.

2553
02:51:31,250 --> 02:51:33,959
Holy shit, okay, I got him.

2554
02:51:33,959 --> 02:51:36,739
Okay, catch one weenie worm, feed.

2555
02:51:36,739 --> 02:51:54,989
Oh, eat what?

2556
02:51:54,989 --> 02:52:00,139
Let me look at my book.

2557
02:52:00,139 --> 02:52:02,690
What's with you?

2558
02:52:02,690 --> 02:52:11,159
Weenie worm loves mustard, hates ketchup.

2559
02:52:11,159 --> 02:52:13,639
It's only motivated by its hatred of ketchup.

2560
02:52:13,639 --> 02:52:19,760
What does it eat?

2561
02:52:19,760 --> 02:52:22,469
Eat it to her.

2562
02:52:22,469 --> 02:52:36,659
Oh, right, okay.

2563
02:52:36,659 --> 02:52:38,879
I think I want another Steak'em's.

2564
02:52:38,879 --> 02:52:40,479
I wanna give somebody a Steak'em's

2565
02:52:40,479 --> 02:52:42,559
and have it be like their Steak'em's brain.

2566
02:52:42,559 --> 02:52:44,649
Give it in their head.

2567
02:52:44,649 --> 02:52:47,459
It's your trajectory, right?

2568
02:52:47,780 --> 02:52:49,139
Here, look at that.

2569
02:52:49,139 --> 02:52:51,260
Okay, get ready.

2570
02:52:51,260 --> 02:52:54,500
And shoot you, and I'll take one, please.

2571
02:52:54,500 --> 02:52:56,299
Now we have full inventory, let's go.

2572
02:52:59,639 --> 02:53:03,270
Oh, wait, there's this weird guy up here.

2573
02:53:03,270 --> 02:53:06,500
What's his problem?

2574
02:53:06,500 --> 02:53:11,409
Pacing you?

2575
02:53:11,409 --> 02:53:14,010
Oh, it's anger from inside out.

2576
02:53:14,010 --> 02:53:17,379
Hello, friend, welcome, but take a look.

2577
02:53:17,379 --> 02:53:20,219
I assure you, you won't be disappointed.

2578
02:53:21,420 --> 02:53:23,500
The name's Cromdo Face,

2579
02:53:23,500 --> 02:53:26,020
the one and only salesman in paradise.

2580
02:53:26,739 --> 02:53:28,299
Let's eat.

2581
02:53:28,299 --> 02:53:30,899
Okay, what do you like to eat?

2582
02:53:30,899 --> 02:53:33,940
Friend, have I got a bridge to sell you.

2583
02:53:33,940 --> 02:53:35,819
Beautiful, isn't it?

2584
02:53:35,819 --> 02:53:37,100
Did I weenie dog him?

2585
02:53:37,100 --> 02:53:39,219
New construction, huh?

2586
02:53:39,219 --> 02:53:42,100
Oh, baby, what a bridge.

2587
02:53:42,100 --> 02:53:45,500
All yours for just 100 bucks next.

2588
02:53:45,500 --> 02:53:46,500
What do you say?

2589
02:53:48,100 --> 02:53:49,540
I can't even carry that much.

2590
02:53:51,059 --> 02:53:53,180
Can't afford it, no problem.

2591
02:53:53,180 --> 02:53:55,620
I got a specialty item just for you.

2592
02:53:55,659 --> 02:53:58,020
Cheap as free, follow me, pal.

2593
02:54:00,850 --> 02:54:02,409
I think I wanna follow you.

2594
02:54:02,409 --> 02:54:06,290
Feast your eyes on this beautiful lunch pad.

2595
02:54:06,290 --> 02:54:08,489
Totally for sale and not at all stolen.

2596
02:54:09,530 --> 02:54:11,290
You're itching to try it out, I can tell.

2597
02:54:11,290 --> 02:54:13,010
Does it bounce, pal?

2598
02:54:13,010 --> 02:54:15,409
My windmills over there got stuck.

2599
02:54:15,409 --> 02:54:17,690
Why don't you take it for a spin

2600
02:54:17,690 --> 02:54:19,250
and knock him into shape?

2601
02:54:19,250 --> 02:54:20,809
Yeah, will you go back to town?

2602
02:54:22,559 --> 02:54:24,479
Switch to it with Q.

2603
02:54:24,479 --> 02:54:35,229
Wait, aim.

2604
02:54:35,270 --> 02:54:39,399
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, what?

2605
02:54:39,399 --> 02:54:52,799
Why was that not ready?

2606
02:54:52,799 --> 02:54:57,559
God damn it, wait, I'll be back.

2607
02:54:57,559 --> 02:55:00,200
I feel like I'm playing 007, GoldenEye.

2608
02:55:00,200 --> 02:55:10,299
Isn't there a watch that you can laser people?

2609
02:55:10,299 --> 02:55:15,190
All right, aim, launch.

2610
02:55:15,190 --> 02:55:18,020
You understand what the fuck just happened?

2611
02:55:18,020 --> 02:55:19,260
Why is it changing?

2612
02:55:19,260 --> 02:55:26,829
I'm aiming and then I'm just, I'm launching.

2613
02:55:26,829 --> 02:55:29,850
Too heavy, okay.

2614
02:55:29,850 --> 02:55:37,299
Aim, what?

2615
02:55:37,299 --> 02:55:39,760
Why can I not do this?

2616
02:55:39,760 --> 02:55:49,569
See ya.

2617
02:55:49,569 --> 02:55:50,969
No, deploy.

2618
02:55:50,969 --> 02:55:53,889
No, you don't.

2619
02:55:53,889 --> 02:56:12,940
Pick this up.

2620
02:56:12,940 --> 02:56:24,860
Bingo.

2621
02:56:24,860 --> 02:56:26,260
And one more.

2622
02:56:26,260 --> 02:56:29,489
I thought it wanted me to launch myself at it.

2623
02:56:29,489 --> 02:56:33,850
Sorry, I don't have one of those fancy science degrees.

2624
02:56:33,850 --> 02:56:36,129
I just hurt my throat doing that, I don't know why.

2625
02:56:36,129 --> 02:56:40,979
Oh, I feel that hot, sweaty breeze.

2626
02:56:40,979 --> 02:56:42,540
Now it's time to pay up.

2627
02:56:42,540 --> 02:56:44,500
What, you used it, you bought it.

2628
02:56:44,500 --> 02:56:47,299
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

2629
02:56:47,299 --> 02:56:50,620
Hey, hey, you can pay me three of those cheap hoops.

2630
02:56:50,620 --> 02:56:51,459
Cheap hoops?

2631
02:56:51,459 --> 02:56:53,899
Oh, great, fly it around.

2632
02:56:53,899 --> 02:56:57,379
Let's see how they like flying into my mouth.

2633
02:56:57,379 --> 02:56:59,579
Do I have to catch the cheap hoops?

2634
02:56:59,579 --> 02:57:05,579
Five, four, three, two, one.

2635
02:57:05,579 --> 02:57:14,350
No, what happened?

2636
02:57:14,350 --> 02:57:15,510
Oh, okay.

2637
02:57:15,510 --> 02:57:16,350
I can't do this yet.

2638
02:57:16,350 --> 02:57:22,079
I have to deliver this stuff.

2639
02:57:22,079 --> 02:57:27,260
I'll come back into this later.

2640
02:57:27,260 --> 02:57:29,639
Yeah, I got priorities.

2641
02:57:29,639 --> 02:57:32,329
Where is she?

2642
02:57:32,329 --> 02:57:39,649
Digging over here.

2643
02:57:39,649 --> 02:57:40,770
His eyes may as well be closed.

2644
02:57:40,770 --> 02:57:41,770
He has no idea what he's doing.

2645
02:57:41,770 --> 02:57:43,010
What are you talking about?

2646
02:57:44,309 --> 02:57:46,270
I have a weenie dog right here.

2647
02:58:04,489 --> 02:58:06,850
I found a lot of corpses.

2648
02:58:09,489 --> 02:58:10,969
Spender Otto, I did not.

2649
02:58:20,940 --> 02:58:23,260
Well, I gotta solve this mystery.

2650
02:58:23,260 --> 02:58:25,780
Sorry, but I won't be going back to Snaxburg.

2651
02:58:25,780 --> 02:58:26,819
You will, eventually.

2652
02:58:27,739 --> 02:58:29,459
If Wambus wants me back,

2653
02:58:29,459 --> 02:58:32,459
well, he can come out here and tell me himself.

2654
02:58:33,500 --> 02:58:36,219
You might have heard things haven't been too good

2655
02:58:36,219 --> 02:58:37,979
between us.

2656
02:58:37,979 --> 02:58:41,540
I keep telling myself I'll get around to C&M,

2657
02:58:41,540 --> 02:58:46,540
but it's just easier to stay out here with the bone.

2658
02:58:47,379 --> 02:58:51,100
Weird lady, weird lady, weird lady, weird lady,

2659
02:58:51,100 --> 02:58:52,139
weird lady, weird lady.

2660
02:58:52,139 --> 02:58:52,979
Get out.

2661
02:58:57,579 --> 02:58:58,659
What?

2662
02:58:58,659 --> 02:58:59,500
She's going back, I did it.

2663
02:58:59,500 --> 02:59:03,120
I win.

2664
02:59:03,120 --> 02:59:14,350
I did it.

2665
02:59:14,350 --> 02:59:15,909
I thought she said she wasn't gonna be going back

2666
02:59:15,909 --> 02:59:20,420
to Snaxburg.

2667
02:59:20,420 --> 02:59:22,420
Your mind changed immediately.

2668
02:59:22,420 --> 02:59:32,079
All right, I gotta donate these.

2669
02:59:32,079 --> 02:59:35,780
We told her about the cactus wipe, I did.

2670
02:59:35,780 --> 02:59:39,379
I did good.

2671
02:59:39,379 --> 02:59:44,450
She would be good at Among Us, unlike you.

2672
02:59:44,489 --> 02:59:46,090
Is that supposed to be an insult?

2673
02:59:46,090 --> 02:59:47,329
It doesn't insult me.

2674
02:59:50,250 --> 02:59:51,090
I don't care.

2675
02:59:57,760 --> 03:00:00,079
If I played Among Us and I got imposter,

2676
03:00:00,079 --> 03:00:01,920
I would just immediately just start killing everybody

2677
03:00:01,920 --> 03:00:03,959
at the spawn while cackling like,

2678
03:00:03,959 --> 03:00:07,920
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, until I was removed from the lobby

2679
03:00:07,920 --> 03:00:09,479
and then I would end my stream.

2680
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:19,879
And then I would write on Twitter.

2681
03:00:21,200 --> 03:00:23,200
Kind of pissed off that people don't wanna play with me

2682
03:00:23,200 --> 03:00:24,680
and it's annoying.

2683
03:00:24,680 --> 03:00:25,639
What the fuck?

2684
03:00:25,639 --> 03:00:26,479
What did I do?

2685
03:00:30,020 --> 03:00:31,379
You're like, that's bullshit.

2686
03:00:31,379 --> 03:00:32,659
I wanna, why?

2687
03:00:32,659 --> 03:00:33,500
Why'd they kick me out?

2688
03:00:33,500 --> 03:00:35,100
I would just start a ton of problems.

2689
03:00:41,329 --> 03:00:42,409
Teenage girl.

2690
03:00:55,780 --> 03:00:57,059
Oh, look, we did good.

2691
03:00:57,059 --> 03:00:58,180
Time for the interview.

2692
03:00:59,059 --> 03:01:01,680
Sounds like a real hoot.

2693
03:01:01,680 --> 03:01:03,799
He's been fucking a cactus?

2694
03:01:03,799 --> 03:01:07,170
Ow.

2695
03:01:07,170 --> 03:01:09,170
All right, who are you?

2696
03:01:09,170 --> 03:01:11,409
Oh, I go digging up bits of history

2697
03:01:11,409 --> 03:01:13,729
and try to piece them back together.

2698
03:01:13,729 --> 03:01:15,649
It's usually not so dramatic.

2699
03:01:15,649 --> 03:01:19,290
Just an old coin or a severed toe under a rock.

2700
03:01:19,290 --> 03:01:24,379
But this island's chock full of fines.

2701
03:01:24,379 --> 03:01:25,659
What was your name?

2702
03:01:25,659 --> 03:01:27,379
Oh, goodness, my name.

2703
03:01:27,379 --> 03:01:29,659
I'm Trifoni Lottoblog.

2704
03:01:29,659 --> 03:01:31,700
That's just, it's just Steve Bruhl.

2705
03:01:32,579 --> 03:01:34,520
Hey, Trifoni.

2706
03:01:34,520 --> 03:01:35,360
Trifoni Lottoblog.

2707
03:01:49,040 --> 03:01:50,360
All right, who's grandma?

2708
03:01:50,360 --> 03:01:51,200
Lisbur.

2709
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:56,440
Sounds like Sarah Palin.

2710
03:02:03,440 --> 03:02:07,530
Pfft.

2711
03:02:12,530 --> 03:02:15,290
It's just, yeah, it's just like generic mid-western.

2712
03:02:18,649 --> 03:02:19,610
It's not Norwegian.

2713
03:02:19,610 --> 03:02:21,290
What do you mean Norwegian accent?

2714
03:02:37,700 --> 03:02:44,860
I want this accent to tell me nursery rhymes.

2715
03:03:03,579 --> 03:03:05,100
Oh, fuck that, this is my accent.

2716
03:03:05,100 --> 03:03:08,700
We'll go on, start reading us some Hansel and Gretel

2717
03:03:08,700 --> 03:03:09,540
or whatever.

2718
03:03:12,020 --> 03:03:16,829
Our grizzliest scars.

2719
03:03:16,829 --> 03:03:19,350
Adventuring is a dangerous business.

2720
03:03:19,350 --> 03:03:23,590
Archaeology less so, but the Lottoblog method

2721
03:03:23,590 --> 03:03:26,389
can be unconventional.

2722
03:03:26,389 --> 03:03:28,350
Bug the heck out of Agabelle.

2723
03:03:28,350 --> 03:03:31,110
She never liked to see anyone hurt.

2724
03:03:31,110 --> 03:03:33,149
Least of all, Liz.

2725
03:03:33,149 --> 03:03:35,149
What the fuck are you talking about?

2726
03:03:36,790 --> 03:03:39,190
I hope that she doesn't die in a QTE.

2727
03:03:39,190 --> 03:03:40,030
Ha ha ha.

2728
03:03:40,030 --> 03:03:40,870
Ha ha ha.

2729
03:03:47,829 --> 03:03:49,309
That's very, very specific.

2730
03:03:49,309 --> 03:03:53,030
Ha, I think it's still funny.

2731
03:03:53,030 --> 03:03:55,270
That's very specific, but I really do think

2732
03:03:55,270 --> 03:03:58,209
that what you just said is funny.

2733
03:03:58,209 --> 03:03:59,850
Thanks, Tiffany, I learned a lot.

2734
03:03:59,850 --> 03:04:02,049
Have fun, have an easy one, bye.

2735
03:04:11,770 --> 03:04:13,530
You might have better luck with it.

2736
03:04:14,409 --> 03:04:17,329
Anywho, I've nearly talked your ear off.

2737
03:04:17,329 --> 03:04:18,170
This is shit load of subs.

2738
03:04:18,170 --> 03:04:21,270
Better get back to work, eh?

2739
03:04:21,270 --> 03:04:28,190
WTR6K4DA, these are the 20 community subs.

2740
03:04:28,190 --> 03:04:32,340
20 subs, thank you.

2741
03:04:32,340 --> 03:04:39,700
WTR6K4DA, thank you.

2742
03:04:39,700 --> 03:04:41,659
Pick a diary, Liz's cabinet key.

2743
03:04:41,659 --> 03:04:43,819
Oh, how about the diary?

2744
03:04:43,819 --> 03:04:46,319
Oh, what's in there?

2745
03:04:46,319 --> 03:04:50,450
You picked up Liz's notes on a secret code.

2746
03:04:50,489 --> 03:04:58,450
Holy crap.

2747
03:04:58,450 --> 03:05:00,489
Looks like I need to weigh down the pressure plates

2748
03:05:00,489 --> 03:05:06,319
in order, first left, and then we don't know.

2749
03:05:06,319 --> 03:05:07,159
Holy crapple.

2750
03:05:07,159 --> 03:05:11,000
Here, why don't you eat, here, have some,

2751
03:05:11,000 --> 03:05:13,280
have some baked potato in the tinfoil.

2752
03:05:20,819 --> 03:05:23,020
Oh, God.

2753
03:05:23,020 --> 03:05:27,120
Ah, those of you guys with fillings,

2754
03:05:27,120 --> 03:05:29,000
putting tinfoil in your mouth is just,

2755
03:05:29,000 --> 03:05:31,120
get it out and get it away.

2756
03:05:31,120 --> 03:05:36,020
Oh my God, that's horrible.

2757
03:05:36,020 --> 03:05:39,409
Ah, I hate it.

2758
03:05:39,409 --> 03:05:41,190
Why would they do that?

2759
03:05:42,149 --> 03:05:45,989
Okay, let's donate a Ripplepeed.

2760
03:05:45,989 --> 03:05:47,750
A, we have to do them all.

2761
03:05:47,750 --> 03:05:50,829
Shy, Weenie, Worm, Spuddy, and a Poptick.

2762
03:05:51,670 --> 03:05:53,870
Size of your heart has grown and so has your inventory.

2763
03:05:53,870 --> 03:05:56,020
Oh, there we go.

2764
03:05:56,020 --> 03:05:57,180
By how much?

2765
03:05:57,180 --> 03:05:59,649
By two?

2766
03:05:59,649 --> 03:06:01,729
12 donations now.

2767
03:06:01,729 --> 03:06:06,809
Look, we can see they're all friends.

2768
03:06:06,809 --> 03:06:11,200
Look at them.

2769
03:06:11,200 --> 03:06:13,420
That's my favorite.

2770
03:06:13,420 --> 03:06:14,739
Move.

2771
03:06:14,739 --> 03:06:17,219
Move, streamer, I wanna see Otto.

2772
03:06:17,219 --> 03:06:20,430
Move.

2773
03:06:20,430 --> 03:06:28,219
They're gonna, we're having so much fun.

2774
03:06:29,059 --> 03:06:34,979
They're having so much fun in here.

2775
03:06:34,979 --> 03:06:46,190
All right, now, what do I actually have for quests?

2776
03:06:46,190 --> 03:06:49,000
There's a lot of world here.

2777
03:06:49,000 --> 03:06:50,620
Okay, quests.

2778
03:06:50,620 --> 03:06:54,319
I can do the cheesy poofs.

2779
03:06:54,319 --> 03:06:55,760
Wiggle would like to talk to you about something

2780
03:06:55,760 --> 03:07:00,180
at the beach.

2781
03:07:00,180 --> 03:07:02,639
Turn the grumps to snackberg.

2782
03:07:02,639 --> 03:07:04,120
Okay, so I have to get everyone to come back

2783
03:07:04,120 --> 03:07:04,959
and then interview everyone.

2784
03:07:04,959 --> 03:07:06,399
That's the main quest.

2785
03:07:06,399 --> 03:07:07,799
What about this one?

2786
03:07:07,799 --> 03:07:08,840
Do I enjoy this game so far?

2787
03:07:08,840 --> 03:07:10,500
Yeah, it's good.

2788
03:07:10,500 --> 03:07:11,579
Well, I'm gonna, let's go to this one.

2789
03:07:11,579 --> 03:07:13,260
Let's track that one.

2790
03:07:13,260 --> 03:07:20,370
Let's go to the beach.

2791
03:07:20,409 --> 03:07:25,670
Why are you playing this?

2792
03:07:25,670 --> 03:07:26,590
It's very cute.

2793
03:07:26,590 --> 03:07:34,219
I could see how this would be relaxing and fun to play.

2794
03:07:34,219 --> 03:07:39,790
All right, we're looking for the guitar player.

2795
03:07:39,790 --> 03:07:42,069
Sweetie fly zips around fast to evade traps

2796
03:07:42,069 --> 03:07:45,260
but eventually it sets down to rest.

2797
03:07:45,260 --> 03:07:46,100
I kinda wanna catch it.

2798
03:07:46,100 --> 03:07:48,620
Where do you land?

2799
03:07:48,620 --> 03:07:50,899
Land over on that rock there.

2800
03:07:50,899 --> 03:07:59,899
All right, let me get your ass.

2801
03:07:59,899 --> 03:08:03,180
What do you like?

2802
03:08:03,180 --> 03:08:04,309
Catch up?

2803
03:08:04,309 --> 03:08:06,430
No, all right, you'll come down here and land.

2804
03:08:06,430 --> 03:08:21,799
I'll be ready.

2805
03:08:21,799 --> 03:08:26,200
Aha, we got a lovely sweetie fly.

2806
03:08:26,200 --> 03:08:27,239
Are there legendaries in this game

2807
03:08:27,239 --> 03:08:32,500
where shiny is like Pokemon?

2808
03:08:32,500 --> 03:08:33,700
Oh, hi darling.

2809
03:08:33,700 --> 03:08:37,899
Welcome to wiggle, wiggle bottom steamy walking tour.

2810
03:08:37,899 --> 03:08:38,739
Lucky you.

2811
03:08:38,739 --> 03:08:40,819
It's an ooey gooey sweetie fly.

2812
03:08:40,819 --> 03:08:44,100
Oh, I can see you're utterly starstruck.

2813
03:08:44,100 --> 03:08:45,340
Don't fret, darling.

2814
03:08:45,340 --> 03:08:48,139
I always have time for my fans.

2815
03:08:51,729 --> 03:08:54,049
Go back to, uh, Sackberg.

2816
03:08:55,049 --> 03:08:57,250
Darling, it will have to wait.

2817
03:08:57,250 --> 03:09:01,209
I simply cannot rest until I find my muse.

2818
03:09:01,209 --> 03:09:02,850
And by muse, I mean butt snacks.

2819
03:09:02,850 --> 03:09:03,690
What's your favorite?

2820
03:09:03,690 --> 03:09:04,530
I might have it.

2821
03:09:04,530 --> 03:09:07,329
Change starts from the outside in, darling.

2822
03:09:07,329 --> 03:09:11,569
If I want new ideas, I need a new look.

2823
03:09:11,569 --> 03:09:13,850
How about a wild new hairdo?

2824
03:09:13,850 --> 03:09:14,690
A pine-a-tula.

2825
03:09:14,690 --> 03:09:18,319
Get me a pine-a-tula and we'll see what we can do.

2826
03:09:18,319 --> 03:09:20,200
Okay, you want pine-a-tula hair.

2827
03:09:21,200 --> 03:09:28,500
What about a sweetie fly beard?

2828
03:09:28,500 --> 03:09:29,579
Oh, cool.

2829
03:09:33,129 --> 03:09:37,420
But how can you ever play the guitar again?

2830
03:09:37,420 --> 03:09:46,260
All right, let's dig one up.

2831
03:09:46,299 --> 03:09:49,940
Ruined her career, kind of.

2832
03:09:49,940 --> 03:09:52,299
Your trajectory is here.

2833
03:09:52,299 --> 03:09:53,940
Get dug out of the ground.

2834
03:09:53,940 --> 03:09:58,059
Cover you in, I believe it's chocolate.

2835
03:09:58,059 --> 03:09:59,579
Ow.

2836
03:09:59,579 --> 03:10:06,909
All right, somebody dig that up.

2837
03:10:06,909 --> 03:10:13,870
Chocolate.

2838
03:10:13,870 --> 03:10:14,709
Right there.

2839
03:10:15,870 --> 03:10:20,829
You think I'm gonna both?

2840
03:10:20,829 --> 03:10:22,780
Oh, I doubled it up.

2841
03:10:22,780 --> 03:10:23,620
I didn't know you could do that.

2842
03:10:23,620 --> 03:10:29,239
I thought only one could fit in there.

2843
03:10:29,239 --> 03:10:31,659
That's cool to know.

2844
03:10:31,659 --> 03:10:34,500
All right, here you go.

2845
03:10:34,500 --> 03:10:35,379
Pineapple head.

2846
03:10:41,959 --> 03:10:43,360
Struck a chord.

2847
03:10:43,360 --> 03:10:46,739
With a new head, I can think no thoughts.

2848
03:10:46,739 --> 03:10:49,219
That's the magic of bug snacks.

2849
03:10:49,219 --> 03:10:53,180
Now my creative juices can flow.

2850
03:10:53,180 --> 03:10:54,819
This is my favorite character.

2851
03:10:54,819 --> 03:10:57,579
Hmm, I know I'm flowing, I'm flowing.

2852
03:10:57,579 --> 03:11:03,020
Hmm, hmm, hmm, ooh, ooh, ooh.

2853
03:11:03,020 --> 03:11:04,620
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

2854
03:11:04,620 --> 03:11:06,700
You and me are gonna be really, really good friends.

2855
03:11:06,700 --> 03:11:07,540
I can already tell.

2856
03:11:07,540 --> 03:11:10,329
This flow is more of a dribble.

2857
03:11:10,329 --> 03:11:12,790
Need you to turn it up, darling.

2858
03:11:12,790 --> 03:11:14,469
Buy me a grape skeeter.

2859
03:11:14,469 --> 03:11:16,629
They're too fast for Granville or I to catch,

2860
03:11:16,629 --> 03:11:18,229
but maybe you can find a way to slow them down.

2861
03:11:18,229 --> 03:11:21,850
Grape skeeto?

2862
03:11:21,850 --> 03:11:23,610
Some bug snacks are only around at certain times.

2863
03:11:23,610 --> 03:11:25,250
You can scan evidence in the environment

2864
03:11:25,250 --> 03:11:27,729
to get a clue about when to find them.

2865
03:11:27,729 --> 03:11:29,770
Bug, okay, a grape skeeto.

2866
03:11:31,379 --> 03:11:39,590
I gotta find like grape juice on the ground?

2867
03:11:39,590 --> 03:11:41,860
Evidence.

2868
03:11:41,860 --> 03:11:42,700
Fruity goop.

2869
03:11:42,700 --> 03:11:45,299
This fruity, leafy glob is evidence of a bug snack.

2870
03:11:45,299 --> 03:11:47,579
This bug snack seems to appear at night,

2871
03:11:47,579 --> 03:11:50,379
but not when it's raining.

2872
03:11:50,379 --> 03:11:56,059
Hmm, all right, let's sleep with that grape skeeto.

2873
03:11:56,059 --> 03:12:01,379
Do you have a bed in your house?

2874
03:12:01,379 --> 03:12:02,219
Where's the bed?

2875
03:12:02,219 --> 03:12:12,159
Is there a bed in here?

2876
03:12:12,159 --> 03:12:18,250
All right, sleep until midnight.

2877
03:12:18,250 --> 03:12:19,090
I just heard it.

2878
03:12:19,090 --> 03:12:23,059
Somebody just said their name.

2879
03:12:26,110 --> 03:12:26,950
It's for free.

2880
03:12:26,950 --> 03:12:28,270
That's free.

2881
03:12:28,270 --> 03:12:32,280
All right, grape skeeto.

2882
03:12:32,280 --> 03:12:36,219
Just heard it.

2883
03:12:36,219 --> 03:12:39,190
That would be a grape skeeto.

2884
03:12:39,190 --> 03:12:40,790
This one plumps up and slows down

2885
03:12:40,790 --> 03:12:43,750
if it eats another bug snack and it loves chocolate.

2886
03:12:43,750 --> 03:12:48,100
So let's cover this in chocolate.

2887
03:12:48,100 --> 03:12:50,180
Go eat it.

2888
03:12:50,180 --> 03:12:52,700
Let's get him.

2889
03:12:52,700 --> 03:12:57,020
There you go, there's your grape skeeto.

2890
03:12:57,020 --> 03:12:58,180
Why is the cap a gold?

2891
03:12:58,180 --> 03:12:59,020
I don't know.

2892
03:12:59,059 --> 03:13:04,870
Haven't figured that out yet.

2893
03:13:04,870 --> 03:13:06,469
Okay, here's your grape skeeto.

2894
03:13:09,219 --> 03:13:13,520
What did you want it?

2895
03:13:13,520 --> 03:13:17,389
Did you want it on your hand?

2896
03:13:17,389 --> 03:13:19,229
You never played the guitar again.

2897
03:13:19,229 --> 03:13:21,989
I bandaged up both of your hands.

2898
03:13:21,989 --> 03:13:26,809
And now the ideas will flow.

2899
03:13:26,809 --> 03:13:29,129
Mm-hmm, they gon' flow.

2900
03:13:29,129 --> 03:13:32,290
Ooh, any second now, come on now.

2901
03:13:32,290 --> 03:13:33,450
I assure you.

2902
03:13:35,309 --> 03:13:37,389
You're my favorite political streamer.

2903
03:13:37,389 --> 03:13:38,229
I have nothing.

2904
03:13:38,229 --> 03:13:39,069
Thanks, man.

2905
03:13:39,069 --> 03:13:40,389
You go over the issues here.

2906
03:13:40,389 --> 03:13:43,190
Back on this beach that can give me the inspiration

2907
03:13:43,190 --> 03:13:48,190
that I need, which is why you should look in the desert.

2908
03:13:48,590 --> 03:13:51,590
I need a look that pops, a look that's hot.

2909
03:13:51,590 --> 03:13:54,030
That's why you're here.

2910
03:13:54,030 --> 03:13:55,989
Listen to me talk about the issues.

2911
03:13:55,989 --> 03:13:58,270
If you could go to the Scorched Gorge

2912
03:13:58,270 --> 03:14:00,430
and catch two Pop Sticks.

2913
03:14:06,040 --> 03:14:11,489
Ooh, catch two Pop Sticks.

2914
03:14:11,489 --> 03:14:18,409
From a fix America.

2915
03:14:18,409 --> 03:14:23,250
I'm just a clown.

2916
03:14:23,250 --> 03:14:24,530
I'm just a clown, man.

2917
03:14:25,489 --> 03:14:32,579
I can't fix anything.

2918
03:14:32,579 --> 03:14:35,899
Like Bozo the Clown, like fucking Richard Nixon

2919
03:14:35,899 --> 03:14:37,659
didn't pull Bozo the Clown in and go,

2920
03:14:37,659 --> 03:14:40,219
we need to fight, excuse me, Bozo.

2921
03:14:40,219 --> 03:14:43,020
Well, how do you feel about foreign policy?

2922
03:14:43,020 --> 03:14:46,860
No, I just entertain children.

2923
03:14:46,860 --> 03:14:47,940
Perfect, you get on the board.

2924
03:14:47,940 --> 03:14:53,540
You're perfect for us.

2925
03:14:53,540 --> 03:14:55,100
Not implying that you guys are children.

2926
03:14:55,100 --> 03:14:56,180
I'm implying that you're children.

2927
03:14:56,180 --> 03:14:57,940
None of you guys, maybe some of you are.

2928
03:14:57,940 --> 03:14:59,979
But you had to click that 18 plus logo

2929
03:14:59,979 --> 03:15:01,659
when you got to the stream first.

2930
03:15:01,659 --> 03:15:03,260
So you might be lying.

2931
03:15:03,299 --> 03:15:05,870
Don't lie, that's not good.

2932
03:15:05,870 --> 03:15:08,620
Pop Sticks.

2933
03:15:08,620 --> 03:15:14,700
Wait, is that the popcorn?

2934
03:15:14,700 --> 03:15:24,350
All right, I gotta get two Pop Sticks.

2935
03:15:24,350 --> 03:15:29,909
I'm out.

2936
03:15:29,909 --> 03:15:32,459
I gotta go to the Fire Land.

2937
03:15:32,459 --> 03:15:36,260
Does this game ever get interesting?

2938
03:15:36,260 --> 03:15:39,260
I mean, that depends on what you think is interesting.

2939
03:15:39,260 --> 03:15:40,299
You think collecting bugs

2940
03:15:40,299 --> 03:15:42,100
and taking pictures is interesting?

2941
03:15:42,100 --> 03:15:47,180
Then you're gonna love it.

2942
03:15:47,180 --> 03:15:51,389
You think this is dumb?

2943
03:15:51,389 --> 03:15:53,110
I think you probably wouldn't wanna play it

2944
03:15:53,110 --> 03:15:57,100
if you don't think that like picking up food bugs is cool.

2945
03:15:57,100 --> 03:16:01,799
This is not the game for you.

2946
03:16:02,440 --> 03:16:03,440
Let's just complete this now

2947
03:16:03,440 --> 03:16:04,760
because I know that it's available.

2948
03:16:04,760 --> 03:16:07,479
So let's go to Burning Gorge.

2949
03:16:07,479 --> 03:16:24,639
And yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery.

2950
03:16:27,989 --> 03:16:29,229
I can't even.

2951
03:16:29,229 --> 03:16:33,379
All right, let's get these two.

2952
03:16:33,379 --> 03:16:39,430
Fire, fire!

2953
03:16:39,430 --> 03:16:44,350
No, you burnt my thing.

2954
03:16:44,350 --> 03:16:49,020
All right, you'll come out eventually.

2955
03:16:49,020 --> 03:16:53,020
Did you just torch my shit?

2956
03:16:53,020 --> 03:16:54,260
No!

2957
03:16:54,260 --> 03:16:56,340
Is he gonna burn?

2958
03:16:56,340 --> 03:16:57,780
Why are you doing this, dude?

2959
03:17:06,010 --> 03:17:08,129
The bush is on fire.

2960
03:17:08,129 --> 03:17:09,530
Oh no, it's okay.

2961
03:17:09,530 --> 03:17:20,969
Just burn all the bushes so they can't run away.

2962
03:17:20,969 --> 03:17:32,399
Stop!

2963
03:17:32,399 --> 03:17:36,260
What the fuck?

2964
03:17:36,260 --> 03:17:37,219
Stop burning them.

2965
03:17:37,219 --> 03:17:47,319
Stop lighting them on fire.

2966
03:17:47,319 --> 03:17:50,540
I put them out?

2967
03:17:50,540 --> 03:17:55,340
I can't put them out.

2968
03:17:55,340 --> 03:18:02,370
Hey, you, fuck off.

2969
03:18:02,370 --> 03:18:07,299
Lead them to the river.

2970
03:18:07,299 --> 03:18:08,180
Oh, there we go.

2971
03:18:08,180 --> 03:18:20,510
Oh my God, stop.

2972
03:18:20,510 --> 03:18:21,350
Kill the scorpion?

2973
03:18:21,350 --> 03:18:29,079
I can't.

2974
03:18:29,079 --> 03:18:29,920
How am I supposed to kill it?

2975
03:18:29,920 --> 03:18:40,690
Throw poop.

2976
03:18:40,690 --> 03:18:41,969
Launch pad.

2977
03:18:41,969 --> 03:18:43,770
Okay, I'm gonna throw a rock at this motherfucker.

2978
03:18:43,770 --> 03:18:55,799
I swear to God.

2979
03:18:56,799 --> 03:18:59,379
What do you hate?

2980
03:18:59,379 --> 03:19:03,260
You hate spicy food, but you love mustard food.

2981
03:19:03,260 --> 03:19:05,260
I don't have any of that stuff.

2982
03:19:05,260 --> 03:19:13,879
He's distracted.

2983
03:19:13,879 --> 03:19:17,969
No!

2984
03:19:17,969 --> 03:19:19,969
Sauce near Danny.

2985
03:19:19,969 --> 03:19:24,559
Who the fuck is Danny?

2986
03:19:24,559 --> 03:19:25,639
How do I lure these guys away?

2987
03:19:25,639 --> 03:19:27,780
What do you guys hate?

2988
03:19:27,780 --> 03:19:38,500
They love chocolate.

2989
03:19:38,500 --> 03:19:39,620
Fuck, what am I doing?

2990
03:19:50,620 --> 03:20:01,649
No, do you not see the sauce right here, man?

2991
03:20:01,649 --> 03:20:03,229
Where's the other one?

2992
03:20:03,229 --> 03:20:15,110
I think the other one burnt to death.

2993
03:20:15,110 --> 03:20:21,030
Don't worry, there's more.

2994
03:20:21,030 --> 03:20:21,870
There's one right here.

2995
03:20:21,909 --> 03:20:25,190
All right, pop this guy.

2996
03:20:25,190 --> 03:20:27,399
And actually, pop them both.

2997
03:20:27,399 --> 03:20:28,719
No, don't shoot me with that fire.

2998
03:20:28,719 --> 03:20:29,559
No, don't.

2999
03:20:29,559 --> 03:20:33,309
Oh, you got me with the fire.

3000
03:20:33,309 --> 03:20:36,510
Oh, you got me.

3001
03:20:36,510 --> 03:20:41,940
He actually is getting me and not these.

3002
03:20:41,940 --> 03:20:51,780
Dude, aim at this.

3003
03:20:51,780 --> 03:20:53,750
Pop.

3004
03:20:53,750 --> 03:20:54,670
There's water here.

3005
03:20:54,670 --> 03:20:56,829
I can't pop this.

3006
03:20:56,829 --> 03:21:03,450
Go eat the chocolate.

3007
03:21:03,450 --> 03:21:11,059
Chocolate.

3008
03:21:11,059 --> 03:21:11,899
Can I get them un-popped?

3009
03:21:11,899 --> 03:21:14,479
No, they gotta be popped.

3010
03:21:14,479 --> 03:21:16,079
This is a really shitty place to do this.

3011
03:21:16,079 --> 03:21:20,610
How about over here?

3012
03:21:20,610 --> 03:21:24,459
Build a sentry.

3013
03:21:24,459 --> 03:21:26,180
Go get mustard from the store.

3014
03:21:26,219 --> 03:21:29,139
I feel like I can get one of these.

3015
03:21:29,139 --> 03:21:30,780
How can you be bad at bug snacks?

3016
03:21:30,780 --> 03:21:33,659
I'm not bad at bug snacks.

3017
03:21:33,659 --> 03:21:38,020
This is weird and I'm not bad at bug snacks.

3018
03:21:38,020 --> 03:21:43,090
Bad, you can't be bad at everything, okay?

3019
03:21:43,090 --> 03:21:43,930
There it is.

3020
03:21:43,930 --> 03:21:46,870
All right, he's gonna turn into a popcorn.

3021
03:21:46,870 --> 03:21:48,069
Don't let him, don't let him.

3022
03:21:48,069 --> 03:21:49,110
All right, good, good, good, good, good.

3023
03:21:49,110 --> 03:21:49,950
Okay, now put him in.

3024
03:21:49,950 --> 03:21:53,190
Go, okay, now chocolate over here.

3025
03:21:53,190 --> 03:21:56,760
Follow me.

3026
03:21:56,760 --> 03:21:59,659
No, give me that back.

3027
03:21:59,659 --> 03:22:01,420
Don't touch that, it's not yours.

3028
03:22:01,420 --> 03:22:02,459
All right, watch this, ready?

3029
03:22:02,459 --> 03:22:04,020
Okay.

3030
03:22:04,020 --> 03:22:05,340
Chocolate.

3031
03:22:05,340 --> 03:22:08,920
Get him.

3032
03:22:09,920 --> 03:22:18,719
Fucking piece of shit, I swear to God.

3033
03:22:18,719 --> 03:22:25,340
I have no more sauce.

3034
03:22:25,340 --> 03:22:31,530
Did I eat the bullet?

3035
03:22:31,530 --> 03:22:34,090
Yeah, can I just grab him with a net?

3036
03:22:34,090 --> 03:22:44,120
Yes, okay, okay, we're good, we're good.

3037
03:22:44,120 --> 03:22:47,200
Deliver.

3038
03:22:47,200 --> 03:22:50,110
I am to make a delivery.

3039
03:22:50,110 --> 03:22:53,030
Mad because bad, mad because bad, mad because bad,

3040
03:22:53,030 --> 03:22:55,920
mad because bad, mad because bad.

3041
03:22:55,920 --> 03:22:58,719
Wait, that's a Cheeto puff.

3042
03:22:58,719 --> 03:23:01,290
I need three of these.

3043
03:23:01,290 --> 03:23:02,129
What does it say?

3044
03:23:02,129 --> 03:23:02,969
These things never land

3045
03:23:02,969 --> 03:23:05,409
if only there was a way to catch them midair.

3046
03:23:05,450 --> 03:23:09,059
It's called throw rock at them.

3047
03:23:09,059 --> 03:23:15,739
Hear me out on this one.

3048
03:23:15,739 --> 03:23:17,459
Give me this.

3049
03:23:17,459 --> 03:23:20,290
Give this to me.

3050
03:23:20,290 --> 03:23:22,799
Can't pick up his rock?

3051
03:23:22,799 --> 03:23:23,959
No, I can't even pick the rock up.

3052
03:23:23,959 --> 03:23:29,299
Whatever, I'll be back.

3053
03:23:29,299 --> 03:23:41,049
We gotta feed the Pop Ticks to a guitar person.

3054
03:23:41,049 --> 03:23:48,290
I might be able to bounce myself.

3055
03:23:48,290 --> 03:23:51,709
I'm gonna donate the other ones

3056
03:23:51,709 --> 03:23:54,110
and I'll bring the two Pop Ticks to the lady.

3057
03:23:54,110 --> 03:23:59,579
So donate, donate, donate.

3058
03:23:59,579 --> 03:24:00,700
And we gotta go to the beach.

3059
03:24:00,700 --> 03:24:02,020
Get away from me.

3060
03:24:02,020 --> 03:24:02,860
Oh, yeah.

3061
03:24:03,299 --> 03:24:05,700
They're all so cute.

3062
03:24:05,700 --> 03:24:07,739
Thank you so much.

3063
03:24:07,739 --> 03:24:10,260
Hopefully my little ones will settle down.

3064
03:24:10,260 --> 03:24:12,739
Maybe I can even start training them again.

3065
03:24:16,610 --> 03:24:19,040
Quest complete.

3066
03:24:19,040 --> 03:24:24,920
Now to the beach.

3067
03:24:24,920 --> 03:24:30,129
Maybe this will be enough for her to go back to town.

3068
03:24:30,129 --> 03:24:32,450
Everybody in this game is creepy.

3069
03:24:32,450 --> 03:24:48,219
Yeah, a little.

3070
03:24:48,219 --> 03:24:53,100
Where'd you go?

3071
03:24:53,100 --> 03:24:54,750
Where is she?

3072
03:24:54,750 --> 03:25:00,120
She's in her house like right here.

3073
03:25:00,120 --> 03:25:01,200
She's dead.

3074
03:25:01,200 --> 03:25:06,040
No, she's not right here.

3075
03:25:06,040 --> 03:25:07,799
Okay, two Pop Ticks.

3076
03:25:07,799 --> 03:25:10,360
I guess you're gonna have popcorn feet.

3077
03:25:10,360 --> 03:25:24,059
That's the only thing that's available, right?

3078
03:25:24,059 --> 03:25:25,260
All these feet.

3079
03:25:25,260 --> 03:25:26,100
Ridiculous.

3080
03:25:26,100 --> 03:25:31,020
And I don't have a single new tune in my head.

3081
03:25:31,020 --> 03:25:34,819
Oh, full journey I've taken.

3082
03:25:36,500 --> 03:25:41,500
Darling, I apologize for putting you through such an ordeal.

3083
03:25:42,860 --> 03:25:44,459
It was all for the sake of art.

3084
03:25:44,459 --> 03:25:45,659
What do we think of the theme song?

3085
03:25:45,659 --> 03:25:48,059
And art is priceless.

3086
03:25:49,100 --> 03:25:50,420
Is there a theme song to this game?

3087
03:25:50,659 --> 03:25:51,819
Has she heard it?

3088
03:25:59,790 --> 03:26:01,510

hero hero bonito it's bug snacks see you in three days when you get banned how would i get banned

3105
03:28:09,770 --> 03:28:28,969

3106
03:28:28,969 --> 03:28:39,579
that song in this game so what's the difference if i if the song is in this game versus i play it on

3107
03:28:39,579 --> 03:28:46,700
youtube is it no all right that wasn't in game i have was all kind of computers that's determined

3108
03:28:52,280 --> 03:28:55,559
hey guys we just listened to the caro caro bonito song it's bug snacks

3109
03:28:56,120 --> 03:29:03,290
yeah none of you will ever buy music ever again that's right that makes sense to you doesn't it

3110
03:29:03,930 --> 03:29:14,420
hey i just listened to um i just listened to this the song that i really like i'm canceling my

3111
03:29:14,420 --> 03:29:19,219
spotify i'm never paying for music ever again because of that because i listened to that song

3112
03:29:22,700 --> 03:29:33,799
what what's the logic behind this i don't understand snacksburg is looking pretty

3113
03:29:33,799 --> 03:29:40,840
busy tonight seems like a great time to gather everybody around the old campfire it's exactly

3114
03:29:41,399 --> 03:29:49,670
that's exactly it it's really weird because i feel like they're just throwing out a gigantic net to

3115
03:29:49,670 --> 03:29:56,229
hopefully make like pennies on every dollar you know what i mean and if you do that enough times

3116
03:29:56,229 --> 03:30:02,969
if you just throw out a gigantic net when you when you make potentially like a quarter of a

3117
03:30:02,969 --> 03:30:18,569
penny from like 600 million things is worth it apparently wait we're doing a party and by the way

3118
03:30:19,209 --> 03:30:25,530
why put this shit on youtube feet sitting in the dark i'll tell you there's some spooky stuff out

3119
03:30:25,530 --> 03:30:34,090
there there ain't nothing out there just why upload these songs to youtube are we never are

3120
03:30:34,090 --> 03:30:38,569

03:30:38,569 --> 03:30:41,209
all the lights are all off and our windows are all closed

3122
03:30:41,209 --> 03:30:48,409

03:50:17,940 --> 03:50:26,860
nova inside my creative energy like i've never felt before i love the wiggles whatever price

3240

the toilet you go to the bathroom and wiggle she and eggy bell were big fans of mine you know i

3246
03:51:21,579 --> 03:51:28,090
met them backstage at my first farewell tour they didn't have passes mind you liz climbed in

3247
03:51:28,090 --> 03:51:35,479
through the air ducts he wiggle during surgery but if somebody breaks the law out of who am i to

3248
03:51:35,479 --> 03:51:44,489
turn them away we said shut up in all capitals all right all right all right so what happened

3249
03:51:44,489 --> 03:51:50,969
to her let's get more info that night when liz went missing i ran into the woods looking for her

3250
03:51:50,969 --> 03:51:57,690
but instead i found something terrifying towering over the trees would you guys think

3251
03:51:57,690 --> 03:52:02,489
it was funny if i did a stream where every single person in chat was modded her screech

3252
03:52:02,489 --> 03:52:12,180
what definitely and i just had the webcam full cam screaming with like the flight of the bumblebee

3253
03:52:12,180 --> 03:52:29,899
in the background i can't be sure anything said that thing that would be the last stream well

3254
03:52:29,899 --> 03:52:35,500
could be part of the retirement stream whenever that is i feel the warm glow whenever the

3255
03:52:35,500 --> 03:52:45,690
retirement stream is however long that is away we'll do it then in 40 years it's true if you

3256
03:52:45,690 --> 03:52:55,340
don't believe me go and see for yourself now if you'll excuse me i've got music to make

i want this character in smash brothers all right wiggle gave you a map to liz's last location

3258
03:53:03,559 --> 03:53:18,629
that's intriguing all right we found that we're gonna go back to becca and then wiggle would like

3259
03:53:18,629 --> 03:53:25,620
to talk to you about something she would what the hell are you lying on the bed frame like the

3260
03:53:25,620 --> 03:53:41,459

3261
03:53:41,459 --> 03:53:48,899
like your run-of-the-mill bug snacks aren't getting my creative juices flowing i need something oh

3262

3657
05:22:09,529 --> 05:22:16,180
the bridge is yours some assembly required the pretzel burger is good but if you burp after you

3658
05:22:16,180 --> 05:22:23,029
will fucking die and so you know it makes me not want to eat it for any loss or injury something

3659
05:22:23,509 --> 05:22:29,430
of the use of it i i know what you mean by that and that scares me anything at all please please

3660
05:22:29,430 --> 05:22:41,400
please call your friend what does that mean that i am when in my mind i assume that you didn't

3661
05:22:41,400 --> 05:22:56,630
even fix the bridge you didn't do anything what i feel okay if after you eat like a bunch of

3662
05:22:56,630 --> 05:23:03,270
cheese and pretzel and bacon and pub cheese i can imagine the burps would come up and it would be

3663
05:23:03,590 --> 05:23:07,830
number one they would stink right like don't let's be real but be realistic with ourselves

3664
05:23:07,830 --> 05:23:12,150
they probably smell horrible and it would probably burn too like a little like painful and like

3665
05:23:12,150 --> 05:23:27,939
acidity hurt your throat too yeah probably what the fuck is pub cheese you know i don't know what

3666
05:23:27,939 --> 05:23:38,040
it is it's this orange spreadable cream cheese shit that has this odd taste to it what is pub

3667
05:23:38,119 --> 05:24:00,630
cheese it's cheese and alcohol he's from beer no no i don't think it is pub cheese is human vomit

3668
05:24:00,630 --> 05:24:08,279
that's gross it's beer cheese hold on wait wait wait i need to look at this i'm gonna wrap it up

3669
05:24:08,279 --> 05:24:22,580
here by the way pub cheese i'm just curious what this is okay what is pub cheese pub cheese is a

3670
05:24:22,580 --> 05:24:27,380
type of soft cheese spread and dip prepared using cheese as a primary ingredient and usually with

3671
05:24:27,380 --> 05:24:35,099
some type of beer or ale so you were right okay it's beer cheese but it's not i've had pub cheese

3672
05:24:35,099 --> 05:24:40,220
a bunch of times before it i've had specifically beer cheese before and beer cheese to me is way

3673
05:24:40,220 --> 05:24:52,299
better pub cheese doesn't taste like beer cheese to me for some reason now i don't i know everything

3674
05:24:52,299 --> 05:25:00,700
