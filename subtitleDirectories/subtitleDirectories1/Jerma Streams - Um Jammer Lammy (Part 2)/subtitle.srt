1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:21,379
This is gonna be fun. Uh, find the video game. No, what are you doing? My PS, my PS is fucked.

2
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:36,630
I don't know where it is. This is not, this is bad. Where is, I'm never liking. There it is.

3
00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:46,380
Where'd the cam go? I turned it off. Boo boo boo, Jeremy you stink, Jeremy you stink.

4
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:54,710
So those of you that don't know, uh, as of tomorrow, tomorrow after tomorrow's stream,

5
00:00:54,710 --> 00:01:00,070
I'm gonna be gone for a few days. Because the Halloween stream is fairly elaborate.

6
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:12,760
And it's, I'm gonna be across the world setting it up. There will be three activities

7
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:24,950
on that stream. Not just the slime stuff. A couple others as well. Yeah, 31st exactly.

8
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:38,659
Dude, he's doing Siren one, two, and three in a row. No. What time is the stream gonna start?

9
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:46,780
Um, probably somewhere in the afternoon Eastern. I would say, this just screamed in my ear.

10
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:57,989
Uh, probably at some point, two, three, four o'clock. I'm gonna lock it down once I know

11
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:03,349
exactly what's going on. Probably around three o'clock Eastern. Between three and four I think.

12
00:02:05,349 --> 00:02:07,290
Oh wait, my money, my money card.

13
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:21,430
It's probably gonna be around four, yeah, it's maybe even a little later than four depending on

14
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,949
how difficult it is to get this whole thing set up over a couple days.

15
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:43,479
Load. Think we're good, right? Oh this, wait, what's stage, stage five?

16
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,439
Which is the airplane one?

17
00:02:48,680 --> 00:03:04,919
Oh no, this one breaks, this one breaks. People actually like this game? Yeah.

18
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:16,949
I like this game. So it's four.

19
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,069
I just, I just wanted to play this song. I don't know, I don't know why. It's a little

20
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:35,189
bit about just hitting triangle over and over again. He's doing it for me. Let's go.

21
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:53,719
Oh, this is in Siren. Yeah, I gotta update that. I've been out of practice.

22
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:02,279
This is crazy Siren gameplay. That makes me laugh. Sorry.

23
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,980
I got the skills to beat you and knock you out.

24
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,319
From cool to bad.

25
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:57,319
That was the info, but look at me, I'm learning just how to fly.

26
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:07,319
I'm still wondering when we get to quest. I'm hungry, I'm sleepy, don't wanna die.

27
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,399
Thought I got cool. The very end, damn it.

28
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:21,610
That was gooder than good. Patience. Thank you. I'm in a hurry. Need to move on.

29
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:28,629
This game is so fun. Let me change it to that. What was another good one?

30
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,259
There's another one that I really liked.

31
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:38,980
Stage two. Yeah, that was it.

32
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,620
Wait, there are more. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

33
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:23,290
there. Stage two, Lamy Parappa team. Manual controller auto. Let's go. I broke something.

34
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:38,360
Wow. Look two. I got two controllers here. See?

35
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:04,139
Carry the equipment, buy snacks, and give us foot massage.

36
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:13,139
Put the PlayStation upside down. No, I don't have to do that yet. So this is, it's dual?

37
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:25,259
This one is hard. Okay, so Lamy controller one. Oh, this song is awesome. Okay, here we go.

38
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:35,659
Let's get on, let's get on. Who's doing this? This has been my long desire. This has been my long

39
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:45,419
desire. Baby, you gotta pull it out quick. Bring it down without a doubt. Bring it down without a doubt.

40
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:49,580
Oh,

41
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:09,210
yeah.

42
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:57,820
Are we stealing points?

43
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:06,070
Mike, you better not go down too tight and get ready for the fire.

44
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:23,059
Push the button and just pull the chain and I'm comfortable.

45
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:25,059
I'm gonna get stuck.

46
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:27,059
You can tell Catherine I am.

47
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:34,490
What the fuck?

48
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,490
This is, uh, Lamy Parappa.

49
00:10:36,490 --> 00:11:02,259
This is the last.

50
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:04,259
Forever?

51
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:07,269
I'm not a liar.

52
00:11:07,429 --> 00:11:15,740
Who won?

53
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:19,129
Okay, that was pretty through now.

54
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:21,129
Okay. Oh, yeah.

55
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:23,929
Is there any more Parappa levels? Like that I can just do? Parappa levels?

56
00:11:25,929 --> 00:11:27,929
Is it just one?

57
00:11:32,409 --> 00:11:47,159
Oh, I remember I got, uh, the game fucked up here.

58
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,700
Stage two Lamy Ramy battle.

59
00:11:55,509 --> 00:12:06,679
Auto level. I need to do this so I want to do the other Parappa levels.

60
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:12,169
Holy shit, what is going on here? Auto assemble player.

61
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:20,149
I remember this broke. Let's do auto.

62
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:25,110
All right, let's do stage, I don't know, stage two, stage four versus, uh, AI.

63
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:29,029
Let's go.

64
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:34,009
It won't break in two player.

65
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,730
But then I have to, like, switch controls and that's annoying.

66
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,490
Oh, right, it's this awesome, cool song.

67
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,570
I just did this one, but I like this one.

68
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,110
Oh, that's my first, that's my alter ego.

69
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,230
Never give it up, soldier.

70
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,230
Take this one, put it on the track, show what you got, soldier.

71
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,230
That was awful.

72
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:23,860
How do you do that?

73
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,860
That was dumb.

74
00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:37,259
I'm good.

75
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:39,259
It's always my brain.

76
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:42,250
Take this one, put it on the track, show what you got, soldier.

77
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,600
Still ahead.

78
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,500
I got a few notes there.

79
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,500
Take this one, put it on the track, show what you got, soldier.

80
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,830
That's gonna be cool. What if I get cool as a twin?

81
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,830
Now it's time to move on.

82
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,830
It only gets much harder, so carry on.

83
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:15,129
Think I'm bold now.

84
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:17,129
I got the skills to beat you and knock you out.

85
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:25,779
He's a sparrows.

86
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:27,779
It's always my brain.

87
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:29,779
Roll rock, clap and scream it.

88
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:38,759
I want my sheets.

89
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:43,129
We got to zero points.

90
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:45,129
You lose.

91
00:14:45,129 --> 00:14:49,799
I just got super insane.

92
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:51,799
Insane.

93
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:53,799
Like, I've heard that exact voice.

94
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:55,799
Then Lemmy just said

95
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,799
Total Distortion.

96
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,799
Total Distortion is one of the people you sell videos to.

97
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:07,799
Yep.

98
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:10,230
That was weird.

99
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,860
I want to do the Parappa shit.

100
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,860
I want to do the Parappa levels that I haven't done.

101
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,610
Lemmy and Parappa team.

102
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,610
I'll just do auto. No, but I want to do that.

103
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:28,139
You think I can get through this without it breaking?

104
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:31,340
Let's see what happens.

105
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,340
It's had like four days to rest.

106
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,340
I've got to get in a different category.

107
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:01,899
I've got to get cool on this and stay on cool.

108
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:03,899
Sound of the alarm work.

109
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:11,769
Alright, let's try to get this thing.

110
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:22,460
That was good.

111
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,909
That was good.

112
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:50,279
That wasn't even bad.

113
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:52,279
I could hardly hear him.

114
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,279
He's like speaking through a wall.

115
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,220
I'm getting some crazy here.

116
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,500
Tool.

117
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,849
Boy, break the game.

118
00:18:11,720 --> 00:19:04,710
I can actually do the other Parappa levels that we didn't see because the disc would break.

119
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,710
Don't ask me how this got fixed.

120
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,140
I have no idea.

121
00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:15,539
He was just splitting the screen the whole time.

122
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:19,539
So now, what's level two?

123
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:21,539
I don't know.

124
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:24,619
I have no idea.

125
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:28,839
He was just splitting the screen the whole time.

126
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:37,160
So now,

127
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,160
what's level two?

128
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,160
I don't know how this got fixed.

129
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,450
I changed the disc speed.

130
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,140
Don't hold your breath though.

131
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,140
It might happen right now.

132
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:17,079
You played an entire whole game about how you want to eat wheat.

133
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:19,079
The whole noodles thing.

134
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:22,730
I thought I got stuck.

135
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:43,099
Shit.

136
00:20:43,099 --> 00:20:47,960
It's the baby level, isn't it?

137
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:57,299
Why is it always the baby?

138
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,480
It's just above the disc.

139
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,190
I'm not putting the PlayStation upside down.

140
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,190
It's in the PS2 right now.

141
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:09,539
That'll break it.

142
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:16,970
I'm going to try to skip the cutscene.

143
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:27,769
That shit again.

144
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:29,769
Put it on its side.

145
00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:32,650
I'll do that.

146
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,650
See if that fixes it.

147
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,650
It's on its side.

148
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:43,619
Toothpaste on disc.

149
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:45,930
No, I'm looking forward to

150
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,170
Jackbox tomorrow, to be honest.

151
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:50,170
That should be a lot of fun before I leave.

152
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:52,170
Because it's all new stuff, right?

153
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:59,660
I haven't used the toothpaste trick in forever.

154
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,660
I actually brought up the toothpaste thing

155
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,660
and everybody yelled at me.

156
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,660
They said, don't do that. That's a bad idea.

157
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,660
I was like, what's going on?

158
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,660
I thought it worked.

159
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,220
It actually works.

160
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,220
Fixed my melee disc.

161
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,579
Yeah, you told me I was wrong.

162
00:22:20,579 --> 00:22:28,460
Okay, here we go.

163
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,460
Let's see if I can do this.

164
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:34,039
Skip the loading

165
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:36,039
and just see if we can get to the game.

166
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:51,140
Shit.

167
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:55,180
That's a rest.

168
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,180
That's a rip. That is a rest in peace here.

169
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,569
Damn it.

170
00:23:00,569 --> 00:23:03,000
It's all good.

171
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:17,140
At least I get to play the airplane level one more time.

172
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:21,500
TS1's got the better laser.

173
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,799
Do I really want to do that?

174
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:29,299
I don't know. Do I really want to?

175
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:49,450
Alright, hold on.

176
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:53,029
Yes.

177
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:56,809
He's motivated.

178
00:23:56,809 --> 00:24:00,460
I don't want to see

179
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:04,420
what's there.

180
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,420
I'm interested to see what

181
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,789
the actual other Parappa levels are.

182
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:12,789
When am I going to go back to do this again?

183
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:15,099
Probably never.

184
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:20,730
This is probably the last time.

185
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,730
One of the last times you're going to see

186
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,730
the PlayStation 1

187
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,730
even turned on.

188
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:29,480
There's still a few

189
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,849
things that I want to do.

190
00:24:31,849 --> 00:24:34,089
But we've done a lot.

191
00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:37,609
There's a lot that I'm forgetting.

192
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:39,609
But for the most part,

193
00:24:39,609 --> 00:24:41,609
maybe this might be one of the last times

194
00:24:41,609 --> 00:24:44,869
you see it.

195
00:24:44,869 --> 00:24:52,359
Never say never. We'll see.

196
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:57,220
Alright, let's see if we can get through this.

197
00:25:13,289 --> 00:25:17,000
That's a great sound.

198
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:25,059
What happened to the startup sound?

199
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:28,970
PS4 doesn't really have one.

200
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:31,779
I mean, kind of.

201
00:25:31,779 --> 00:25:33,779
It's more of like a...

202
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:35,779
What is it?

203
00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:43,980
You know you don't know what...

204
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,980
This is bright as...

205
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,980
Why does this brighten up?

206
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,599
This is really bright.

207
00:25:50,599 --> 00:26:00,779
Alright, I'm just going to skip the cutscene.

208
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:18,740
New content.

209
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:42,869
Let's go.

210
00:26:42,869 --> 00:26:44,869
I win?

211
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,220
I think I'm wet.

212
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,220
I think you're wet.

213
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,220
I think you're neck.

214
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,220
I think I'm neck.

215
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,220
I need to go, you know.

216
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,220
I need to go, you know.

217
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,220
Can't hold much longer, you know.

218
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,220
Are you the person who's never ever ever ever?

219
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,220
Are you the person who's never ever ever ever?

220
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,220
Mama, mama, mama.

221
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,220
Mama, mama, mama, mama.

222
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,220
Now put these kids to sleep, will ya?

223
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,220
Now put these kids to sleep, will ya?

224
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,220
Hey, hey, papa, don't you think I'm good?

225
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,220
Hey, hey, papa, don't you think I'm good?

226
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,220
Now, can I please have my chicken?

227
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,660
Now, can I please have my food?

228
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,660
Now, can I please have my food?

229
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:58,660
How do you get cool on this one?

230
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:04,170
These kids to sleep, will ya?

231
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:06,170
Papa makes a sound, can...

232
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:14,680
Mama, can I have the food?

233
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:21,269
This is freaking me out because...

234
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:23,269
This is freaking me out because...

235
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:25,269
This is that Papa song.

236
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:29,619
This is that Papa song.

237
00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:31,619
What is it? I'll get it this time.

238
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:34,119
I'm going to get cool right now.

239
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:36,119
What is it? I'll get it this time.

240
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:41,430
Mama, mama, mama.

241
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:48,329
Mama, mama, mama.

242
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:50,329
Mama, mama, mama.

243
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:55,500
Mama, mama, mama.

244
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,440
Mama, mama, mama.

245
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,440
Mama, mama, mama.

246
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,440
Mama, mama, mama.

247
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,440
Mama, mama, mama.

248
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,440
Mama, mama, mama.

249
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,440
Mama, mama, mama.

250
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:19,059
Papa, papa, papa, papa...

251
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:20,180
Mama!

252
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:26,200
Mama, can I have the food?

253
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,079
Mama, mama, mama.

254
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:34,440
Chicken, no, chicken, no, no, no.

255
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,440
I'm for a Women'seled chicken, ba-ba-ba-ba.

256
00:29:36,440 --> 00:30:06,440
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa

257
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,039
Mama can I have a body toy? Mama can I have a body toy?

258
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,539
Mama can I have a body toy? Mama can I have a body toy?

259
00:30:11,539 --> 00:31:02,579
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa

260
00:31:02,579 --> 00:31:03,279
Next level!

261
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:06,420
This is extra sacred fucking content.

262
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,880
This is secret.

263
00:31:08,019 --> 00:31:08,440
...

264
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:18,930
Rapa, please don't hold the baby like that.

265
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,309
Skip it!

266
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:21,089
...

267
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:22,049
Skip it! I don't care.

268
00:31:22,509 --> 00:31:23,650
I'm sorry, we have to skip it.

269
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:24,910
I don't, I'm not getting locked out here.

270
00:31:25,829 --> 00:31:26,829
It's the airplane one.

271
00:31:28,849 --> 00:31:35,309
Come on!

272
00:31:35,329 --> 00:31:58,069
Same as last time, yeah.

273
00:31:58,769 --> 00:32:00,769
The Playstation 2 plays the airplane level.

274
00:32:02,309 --> 00:32:20,230
Switch back and forth, that's what we did last time.

275
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:21,849
And it was a pain in the ass.

276
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:46,910
Although, they're both right here now, so...

277
00:32:46,910 --> 00:33:01,240
Pokemon doesn't understand technology. He doesn't get it. He doesn't know what he's doing.

278
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:10,630
What does this plug into?

279
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,930
We'll plug this in, without the laptop.

280
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:13,930
Who did this?

281
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:14,930
Why is this here?

282
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:16,930
Why is there a printer on the floor?

283
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:18,930
These are all very important questions.

284
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,930
Why is there a printer on the floor?

285
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:25,599
I did this.

286
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:32,220
Oops.

287
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,220
That was a full drink. Fuck it. Who cares?

288
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:43,759
Here we go!

289
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:50,480
Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba.

290
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,779
Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba.

291
00:33:53,779 --> 00:33:57,000
Ba ba!

292
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:08,969
Use a coaster?

293
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:11,340
Oh, I use a coaster. Absolutely.

294
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,340
This is actually a pretty nice desk.

295
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:23,809
Use burrito blade 2 as a coaster.

296
00:34:23,809 --> 00:34:27,400
That's not gonna happen.

297
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:36,289
Why would you want me to do that?

298
00:34:36,289 --> 00:34:39,289
All the games that you've seen tonight have been worth playing.

299
00:34:39,289 --> 00:34:44,539
You know what I'm saying?

300
00:34:44,539 --> 00:34:47,119
Don't skip it this time.

301
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,119
Oh, I'm gonna skip it.

302
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,710
I'm gonna skip it as fast as I can.

303
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:59,510
Something bright this time.

304
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:13,329
Nice.

305
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:30,079
Just like it normally does.

306
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,079
Different kind of song, too.

307
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:34,079
Not as fast.

308
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:39,159
I dig it.

309
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:41,340
Set up the lights, turn on the lights.

310
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,340
Fasten the seatbelts for the fight.

311
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,340
Set up the lights, turn on the lights.

312
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,340
Fasten your seatbelts for the fight.

313
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,340
Get up in the morning, run on the track.

314
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,340
Show me what you got, soldier.

315
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,340
Get up for the morning, get up, run on the track.

316
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,340
For the morning, get up for the morning.

317
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,340
Get up for the morning, get up for the morning.

318
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,340
Get up for the morning, get up for the morning.

319
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,340
Get up for the morning, get up for the morning.

320
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,340
Get up for the morning, get up for the morning.

321
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,340
Get up for the morning, get up for the morning.

322
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,340
Get up for the morning, get up for the morning.

323
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,340
Get up for the morning, get up for the morning.

324
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,340
Get up for the morning, get up for the morning.

325
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,340
Get up for the morning, get up for the morning.

326
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,340
Get up for the morning, get up for the morning.

327
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,340
Get up for the morning, get up for the morning.

328
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,340
Get up for the morning, get up for the morning.

329
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,340
All right, Mom.

330
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,710
Fine.

331
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,710
Run on the track, run on the track.

332
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:06,710
Show me what you got, soldier.

333
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:07,710
Get up for the morning, get up for the morning.

334
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:14,190
Get up for the morning, get up for the morning.

335
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:23,130
Get up for the morning, get up for the morning.

336
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:33,840
Get up for the morning, you must be bored.

337
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,579
Me?

338
00:36:37,579 --> 00:36:40,179
Run run on the track.

339
00:36:40,179 --> 00:36:42,179
get up for the morning, show me what you got, get up for the morning

340
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:01,050
what's happened the last time?

341
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:03,230
he just got hit in the head

342
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:20,480
I thought that milk was shit

343
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,480
this plane is going down

344
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,420
Come on

345
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:32,090
Thanks for watching the stream everybody, it was fun. Let's see if I can do this blindfold

346
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:38,269
No, that's not I'm gonna hit loads the first part is it?

347
00:38:38,269 --> 00:38:43,860
Upside down

348
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:21,059
Oh

349
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:37,389
Hit me with it what hit me with it hit me with it

350
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:21,260
Came up

351
00:40:36,449 --> 00:40:43,570
Yeah, thanks put the disk in upside down and then I break my

352
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:51,940
$44 PlayStation 2 you can get a digital version of dumbjammer. Lamy. How?

353
00:40:52,579 --> 00:40:57,960
Is it it's not on PSN. Is it on like the PlayStation 3 PSN?

354
00:40:58,519 --> 00:41:08,579
Well, I know I can emulate it, but I bought the disk thinking it was gonna fucking run in the system

355
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:26,960
Just play the thing for 15 seconds and you can buy a new one. Well, I like playing on original hardware

356
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,429
All right, that's gonna be it for tonight

357
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:39,150
If you bought the actual game already, you shouldn't worry about emulating it. No, but I have to get the control. I feel like alright

358
00:41:40,269 --> 00:41:46,070
Let me show you why that this is something that I have to like plug in a ps4 controller

359
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:52,590
Right. So if I emulate this game, I have to like emulate the controller which is like ps4

360
00:41:53,389 --> 00:41:58,670
Which is dual shock, you know what I mean? Like it's just it's annoying. I already have all the original hardware

361
00:41:59,869 --> 00:42:01,550
I have a

362
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:06,510
Capture device to pull in old hardware. I have all the old hardware. I have all the controls and everyone. I just do it

363
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:08,110
I have it

364
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:12,829
I have like a capture card that's designed for old consoles

365
00:42:15,739 --> 00:42:21,179
Why am I afraid of technology? You see the fucking goddamn technology that's down here capturing the goddamn game

366
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:33,500
Dude, I got cords

367
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:41,619
I got a whole capture device down here

368
00:42:42,579 --> 00:42:44,980
Who needs a fancy phone when the landline works?

369
00:43:02,659 --> 00:43:07,469
Thank you streamer

370
00:43:07,469 --> 00:43:09,469
Thanks streamer

371
00:43:17,889 --> 00:43:20,460
The landline does work

372
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:28,559
Come on. That was that was the only disc that has done that. It's the only one that's done it. We've had

373
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:35,630
we've played like

374
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,500
Honestly, we've probably played like

375
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,019
100

376
00:43:40,019 --> 00:43:43,809
PlayStation 1 and playstation 2 games as the only one that was scratched

377
00:43:44,369 --> 00:44:02,739
Somehow come on. Can we just enjoy the waves of the ps2? Yeah, actually I gotta pee really bad

378
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:06,190
Uh, I haven't gone to pee this whole time

379
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:09,230
In over five hours, so i'm gonna pee we'll come back we'll do the bits

380
00:44:09,949 --> 00:44:11,389
And we will hang up

381
00:44:11,389 --> 00:44:14,019
I will see you guys in

382
00:44:15,739 --> 00:44:17,260
Five minutes maybe

383
00:44:17,260 --> 00:47:48,349
See you soon. Hello. I have returned

384
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:17,550
Put the ps2 sound back on really well. We're about to do the little outro now. We got the cool music, man

385
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:27,440
Hey, thank you phylactery lich

386
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,440
for your 270 subs

387
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:46,289
Because this shit won't ever update I even tried to go in here and fix this too and it wouldn't work

388
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:55,179
What a piece of crap. What a piece of fucking

389
00:48:56,039 --> 00:49:01,710
Crap

390
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:05,739
No, yeah, that'll be it for tonight. We kind of jumped around all over the place

391
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:08,460
We played four games tonight. Can you believe that?

392
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:18,539
And we beat two of them. So for the next

393
00:49:19,969 --> 00:49:21,730
Week or so, let's go over this

394
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:28,510
So tomorrow we're gonna do jackbox

395
00:49:30,139 --> 00:49:32,449
And then I have to get ready to leave

396
00:49:32,449 --> 00:49:35,409
So after tomorrow's stream you'll see me again on 31st

397
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:38,369
for halloween

398
00:49:38,369 --> 00:49:43,730
The special halloween stream that's gonna happen and then I will be back a few days later

399
00:49:44,369 --> 00:49:45,730
obviously have to

400
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:50,320
Clean up and i'm probably gonna visit some family while i'm down there. So

401
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:54,159
I'll be back a couple days. Maybe three days after that four days after that

402
00:50:00,179 --> 00:50:01,780
and then

403
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:05,710
after all that

404
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:07,710
once the halloween stream is

405
00:50:07,789 --> 00:50:09,440
Gone

406
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,760
I kind of wanna i'm either gonna start dead rising

407
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,030
or

408
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:15,550
Uh outer worlds

409
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:21,329
I'm not sure which one

410
00:50:21,329 --> 00:50:23,570
One of them will be started

411
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:32,429
I probably will start with outer worlds just because

412
00:50:33,309 --> 00:50:35,900
it's new

413
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:36,860
and

414
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:38,940
I kind of want to play it just see how it is

415
00:50:39,739 --> 00:50:50,130
And then somewhere in that somewhere in that week, there'll be the other community content night

416
00:50:53,389 --> 00:50:57,070
So yeah, there'll be community content night dead rising and outer worlds

417
00:50:57,969 --> 00:51:00,289
After the halloween stream is what you can expect

418
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:03,500
And that sounds like a good plan to me, but

419
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,420
for right now

420
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:09,219
Let's go over the bits and the community subs

421
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:13,650
Thank you for watching everybody

422
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:19,119
See you tomorrow as always and let's go back

423
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:24,639
Back back back back back back back back back back to sad vega. Thanks for the 250

424
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,340
It happened again and it's your fault. Why is everything gonna be my fault?

425
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,300
I had a dream about streamers last night

426
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:39,179
I was on jeopardy and I was getting my ass kicked by some five-year-old zoomer rapping baby

427
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:40,530
what

428
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:43,250
Until double jeopardy came and it was vine sauce question

429
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:48,800
And it was a vine sauce. Wait, where'd that just go? Here it is

430
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:53,599
It was a vine sauce question and a final jeopardy question, which the answer was germa 985

431
00:51:54,239 --> 00:52:08,849
Well, did you win?

432
00:52:08,849 --> 00:52:10,690
Did you win the game?

433
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:16,699
I did. Well, there you go

434
00:52:17,889 --> 00:52:19,409
As long as you've won

435
00:52:19,409 --> 00:52:23,599
That sounds pretty good

436
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,199
Thanks for the dream

437
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:26,960
the 250

438
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,239
Gnarly, thanks for the 250. I had a dream last night. Oh my fucking god

439
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,119
We're gonna start to get fake ones here now

440
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:36,320
This is gonna become a thing. I can already predict it. I had a dream last night

441
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,599
Don't worry. Not about you. Here we go where I ate a high high

442
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:44,880
Class restaurant with my family in the menus. They gave us were screenshots of twitch chat

443
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:49,780
Like one user wrote spaghetti and meatballs 899

444
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,440
Chicken alfredo

445
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:56,239
I

446
00:52:58,659 --> 00:53:02,579
The funny thing is that they wrote the menu in someone else's twitch chat

447
00:53:03,139 --> 00:53:06,500
So they were just pogchamps and lul's woven between

448
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:09,940
Should I stop watching streams before bed?

449
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:13,280
That is so

450
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,119
Dream, you know

451
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:17,440
That is such a dream thing to happen

452
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:24,030
That's hilarious

453
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:30,429
Um, you don't have to stop watching streams before bed. Just stop having streams play while you are sleeping

454
00:53:33,579 --> 00:53:40,380
I know a lot of you guys have your phones or your ipads in bed and you just fall asleep and there's just it's still going

455
00:53:41,179 --> 00:53:49,219
Put like a sleep timer on your phone. So after like an hour of no activity, the thing will just turn off

456
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:59,579
They used to make tvs like this back in the day

457
00:54:01,489 --> 00:54:05,090
You could set it so to make sure the tv would turn off after like 40 minutes or something

458
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:10,210
Now I know the hardware I got all this hardware, you don't think I got hardware under here

459
00:54:12,139 --> 00:54:15,179
I know it's a boo. I know boomer, but you see have you seen my hardware, dude?

460
00:54:18,219 --> 00:54:22,619
It's a tangled mess of cables that my vr is still plugged in and I haven't used it

461
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:27,019
It's still tangled up in there, but there's a bunch of fucking wires of technology. You don't think I know technology

462
00:54:36,699 --> 00:54:42,059
Vr never again. No i'm waiting for this i'm waiting for them when there's too much vr to ignore it

463
00:54:43,019 --> 00:54:46,190
You know what i'm saying? So like let's do like 20 games

464
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:58,800
I'm waiting for wireless high quality vr

465
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:01,809
um

466
00:55:01,809 --> 00:55:04,190
It's possible

467
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:07,869
But thank you gnarly for the dream. I think i'm thanking people for their dreams

468
00:55:14,989 --> 00:55:17,250
Thank you for the 250

469
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:20,769
Uh rogue of mv. Thanks for the 2000 bits earlier

470
00:55:21,329 --> 00:55:23,329
20 bucks from rogue of mv

471
00:55:23,409 --> 00:55:25,730
Here's the ransom chat has to set you free now

472
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,829
Thank you. Appreciate it. Thanks for the $20 ransom

473
00:55:31,469 --> 00:55:35,360
Appreciate that. It's 2000 bits. It's a lot. Thank you

474
00:55:36,659 --> 00:55:43,380
Mostly lost. Thanks for the 250 the year are only two paper marios and anyone who says differently is kidding themselves

475
00:55:44,099 --> 00:55:55,840
What's the third one three?

476
00:55:55,840 --> 00:56:02,059
What's the third one?

477
00:56:02,059 --> 00:56:04,059
super paper mario

478
00:56:04,139 --> 00:56:07,460
Yeah, because it's super this this paper mario and this paper mario

479
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:12,579
Like the thousand year old door or something, right? What is it the 10,000 year old door?

480
00:56:13,619 --> 00:56:31,820
What was it called? Yeah, that was right. All right. We have another one. Here's an image. It's uh, this is from airless

481
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:33,900
Thanks for 500 bits airless

482
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,300
And they say gerbas smirk

483
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:50,260
Why is this so small? Oh, I just look odd

484
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:56,739
Anthony bantony became relevant again is what some of what he said

485
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:04,829
I did that. I just look strange that doesn't that looks like i'm missing the lego hair. No, I do have the lego hair

486
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:08,880
But that's the mouth mouth is too big and the nose is too long. The eyes are too big

487
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:14,130
Something weird about that photo

488
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:27,940
Uh, thank you airless though for the 500 bits need a lego stream

489
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:41,460
Uh, anyways dark soul. Thanks for the 500 bits really enjoying the streams and thanks for doing them

490
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:48,179
Thank you for watching was awesome meeting you at the supermarket today. What and really like what you did with your hair

491
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:53,070
Right. Okay. I see what you're doing here

492
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,539
uh

493
00:57:55,539 --> 00:57:57,539
You even let me get a great picture with you

494
00:57:58,639 --> 00:58:01,809
Thanks a lot

495
00:58:01,809 --> 00:58:17,170
You motherfucker

496
00:58:24,289 --> 00:58:35,500
God damn it. I'm shaving my head. I'm gonna actually be bald

497
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:41,090
You won't I know I want it's a lie. I would never do that

498
00:58:41,969 --> 00:58:44,820
I would look like a fucking serial killer if I ever shaved my head

499
00:58:49,039 --> 00:58:52,800
Smelly boy. Thanks for the 250. Hey germ. I'm still loving the content. You're such an amazing streamer

500
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:56,480
So what are your honest opinions on sherbert as opposed to ice cream?

501
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,639
I think it's great

502
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:04,880
I think there's a time to have sherbert and it's time to have ice cream. I think they have both incredibly talented ice creams

503
00:59:06,099 --> 00:59:07,940
desserts

504
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:09,699
They both deserve

505
00:59:09,699 --> 00:59:11,300
your time

506
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:23,329
I do love sherbert, especially arren sherbert. He's a centrist

507
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:27,940
Sherbert tastes good and ice cream tastes good

508
00:59:30,619 --> 00:59:32,780
What what what do you want me to say here?

509
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:39,070
What have you have you seen the hardware on my desk? Do you know what's under there? There's a capture card

510
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:42,860
There's another device that feeds

511
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:51,059
Into another capture card that is specifically for old video games and then that splits the connection

512
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:54,170
forty eight percent goes

513
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:57,869
This way and forty eight percent goes the other way

514
00:59:59,579 --> 01:00:01,579
And then it uh shit

515
01:00:05,739 --> 01:00:17,300
Into both monitors and they all come they come together for the middle monitor four percent goes into the back of my neck

516
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,440
Only two monitors in 2019

517
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:30,500
I got three

518
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,150
I got hardware here

519
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:37,630
And I don't I don't know. Hey, here's like oh look at what I look at my desk and here's all my equipment

520
01:00:37,710 --> 01:00:40,559
I don't even do that

521
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:43,599
I got three monitors in a connect on top

522
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:50,260
Do I have 144 hertz monitors? No, it's a scam

523
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:55,980
Human eye can't see over fucking 120 hertz

524
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:10,190
That's a fucking scam

525
01:01:13,969 --> 01:01:15,170
I'll tell you though

526
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:20,610
Uh, here's the real answer to that question. So do I don't have any hundred 144 hertz monitors

527
01:01:21,489 --> 01:01:25,170
And the reason for that is because all of my monitors are 120 hertz

528
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:29,199
so justifying buying three new monitors

529
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,199
for

530
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:33,199
24 hertz on each of them

531
01:01:34,269 --> 01:01:36,510
Is I can't justify that it's not enough

532
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:39,789
Now if I was going to go to like 244 maybe

533
01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:42,510
But I have the opinion that 120 hertz

534
01:01:43,309 --> 01:01:44,269
is

535
01:01:44,269 --> 01:01:45,389
I don't

536
01:01:45,389 --> 01:01:50,670
Okay. Look, I know that like oh, yeah, you're talking about like the analog watch before it. Okay, that's fine

537
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:58,239
Right now I don't think anybody needs more than 120 hertz right now right this second

538
01:02:02,619 --> 01:02:04,989
some people maybe

539
01:02:04,989 --> 01:02:10,349
If you're really really if you have a 4k monitor and you give it you blasted huge frames

540
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:18,980
What am I talking about? I'm talking about

541
01:02:19,619 --> 01:02:22,820
that 120 hertz versus 144 hertz is not worth spending like

542
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:26,659
15 to 2 500 to 2 000 dollars to get three new monitors

543
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:30,849
Not enough to do that. I do guys. I'm just playing parapa the rapper today

544
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:34,130
Do I need a 244 hertz monitor right now?

545
01:02:35,170 --> 01:02:46,690
I need all the I need to the power that I could get

546
01:02:47,809 --> 01:02:54,659
csgo players

547
01:02:54,659 --> 01:02:55,920
right

548
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,880
Uh, I haven't opened csgo in probably two and a half years

549
01:03:07,630 --> 01:03:08,849
cs

550
01:03:08,849 --> 01:03:16,179
Omega low

551
01:03:16,179 --> 01:03:19,940
I don't know why that makes me laugh every time. All right, but there but no fucking no bullshit like no kidding around

552
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:24,820
Um, yeah, I already have 120 hertz and as much as it'd be cool to have them

553
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:28,849
Uh, I don't have a this not necessary maybe eventually

554
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:40,940
But not now thanks for the picture dark soul and thank you smelly boy for the 250. Uh, great sherbert is delicious

555
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:44,610
And well, though, thanks for the 300 bits

556
01:03:44,769 --> 01:03:58,769

Oh, you wrote p ee. I get it. We did the whole alphabet. How'd you do that?

562
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:34,190
This is what I see right now. I'm just gonna show you guys what I see

563
01:04:37,199 --> 01:04:39,199
This is it's a log from the channel

564
01:04:47,170 --> 01:04:49,170
They said this is an epic gamer moment

565
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:58,500
It's just the alphabet. I don't even know when you did this and then you said german nose wipe like 40 times

566
01:04:59,219 --> 01:05:01,900
Did you do this at like two in the morning?

567
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:14,829
That's pretty cool. Nice work

568
01:05:14,829 --> 01:05:18,909
Let's get the credits on the screen. Why not? Thanks everybody for watching. Thanks for supporting the stream

Thanks for the ridiculous amount of subs and bits as always seriously

We're gonna do jackbox for a few hours tomorrow

571
01:05:27,329 --> 01:05:29,650
It's gonna be a chill stream before I have to get ready to leave

572
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:34,300
Get ready and do another one

573
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:43,099
Because just like the carnival stream, I think some people might not realize that this is a lot more intricate than

574
01:05:44,059 --> 01:05:47,340
Uh, i've been maybe coming on over the last week or two

575
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:51,789

576

589
01:07:05,139 --> 01:07:09,059
Thank you hippo rider for the 500 bits throughout the last year. I've been dealing with some very

590
01:07:09,539 --> 01:07:13,219
Uh some very affecting family issues and I know it's cliche

591
01:07:13,219 --> 01:07:17,300
But watching your videos and content has really helped me and I know I haven't been

592
01:07:17,699 --> 01:07:21,219
With the channel throughout all of its years, but i'm going to continue to watch and support it. Thank you

i'm sorry to hear that

594
01:07:25,699 --> 01:07:32,750
Hopefully they result and whether you've been watching for two months or 10 years

595
01:07:34,530 --> 01:07:42,349
Glad to have you. Thanks a lot hippo. I really appreciate it

Gnarly, thanks for the 250

598
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:52,190
You know what before I go to bed when the stream ends

599
01:07:52,190 --> 01:07:56,429
Can you just come up with my dream for me so that I don't have to donate about it tomorrow?

600
01:07:57,809 --> 01:07:59,809
Yeah, sure. Okay. Here's what you can dream about

601
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:01,889
you're going to

602
01:08:01,889 --> 01:08:03,650
Boom eyes open

603
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:05,969
Where am I? Wait a minute to get completely pitch black

604
01:08:06,610 --> 01:08:08,849
What's going on here? If you're gonna be breath you can start breathing

605
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:14,369
This is fucked up. I know you this dead silent. You can't hear anything you do hear

606
01:08:15,010 --> 01:08:18,930
Over you're a little disoriented somehow you look over here in this you keep you

607
01:08:19,329 --> 01:08:23,970
You're making it almost these figures and there's noises little like click like clacks and

608
01:08:24,449 --> 01:08:29,170
You just like what the fuck is going on here. You hear a little cough somebody coughed over there from the left-hand side

609
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:33,890
There's like a five or dozen different silhouettes all staring at you

610
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:39,890
Finally, but right before you wake the fuck up light turns on and it's happy birthday surprise

611
01:08:40,609 --> 01:08:43,569
And it's like all your family and your friends and they they're all there and they love you

612
01:08:44,369 --> 01:08:54,689
And it's a you eat a new cake that you have pizza and it's a really really fun day. It's a great time

613
01:08:59,979 --> 01:09:01,979
Somebody said I hate my family. We'll

01:09:02,619 --> 01:09:04,779
Replace them with all your favorite marvel characters

615
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:15,550
