1
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:23,670
Somebody said,

2
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,670
Hey, I want to talk to your manager.

3
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,670
You're three minutes late.

4
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,510
I am the manager.

5
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:41,280
What do you got to say?

6
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,280
Wait, the title is... Oh, the first...

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,479
I liked my title. It was

8
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,719
having fun farming.

9
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,719
Alright. That's all I need to say.

10
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,609
I got the tweet out already. I was prepared.

11
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:04,420
Hi, how are you?

12
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,239
How's it going?

13
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:10,439
Tonight's going to be a comfy night.

14
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,799
And you can tell that

15
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,799
because I've got a raspberry tea right here

16
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,680
and it's hot.

17
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,879
If I'm drinking hot tea,

18
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:22,879
it's guaranteed to be a comfortable night.

19
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:25,120
It's just the way it is.

20
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:31,010
Raspberry tea?

21
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:34,719
This bro's farming L's.

22
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,680
Yeah. It's alright though.

23
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:44,819
Is it hibiscus?

24
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:46,819
It's raspberry zinger.

25
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:49,319
It's the celestial brand.

26
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:51,620
It's good.

27
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,620
I think it's hibiscus, rose,

28
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,269
petals,

29
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:02,769
some other stuff.

30
00:02:02,769 --> 00:02:04,769
It's good. It doesn't need anything.

31
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:06,769
Don't put sugar in it. Don't put anything in it.

32
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:08,770
It's just good. It just tastes good.

33
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:15,669
Raspberry zinger.

34
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:18,479
House Flipper came out

35
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,069
with an update, as you know.

36
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:24,069
Anytime House Flipper gets

37
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:26,069
a major, major update.

38
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:28,370
I am there day one

39
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,800
playing it. Hour number one.

40
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,680
This DLC released

41
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,680
two or three weeks ago.

42
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,949
So I missed it by a little bit.

43
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:43,039
But it's alright. We're good.

44
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:47,330
Are you going to make a Family Guy house again?

45
00:02:52,199 --> 00:03:01,199
Well, build your own farm.

46
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,340
Fake fan.

47
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:09,409
Every time I restart

48
00:03:09,409 --> 00:03:11,409
House Flipper,

49
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:13,780
I have to go through and get all

50
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,780
the tools and get money again.

51
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,780
Because I just delete everything.

52
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,780
I don't even sync it with the Steam Cloud.

53
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,599
I always say, make sure I do that.

54
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:24,599
And then something goes wrong and I just have to redo everything.

55
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:28,120
Yeah, the farming DLC

56
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,120
came out. Also, not just farming.

57
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,120
Apparently, you can

58
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,120
build your own house

59
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,469
from scratch now.

60
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:40,469
Before, that was a big,

61
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:42,469
one of the only cons

62
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:44,469
of House Flipper

63
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:47,090
was I thought that, oh,

64
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,090
I can't make a house

65
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,090
and put stuff in it.

66
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,909
Now apparently you can.

67
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:55,909
I know, it's called House Flipper.

68
00:03:55,909 --> 00:03:57,909
That's not flipping houses. That's not flipping a house.

69
00:03:57,909 --> 00:04:01,110
But still, I like,

70
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,110
I guess there's some more freedom now.

71
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,110
I don't know exactly how much, we'll find out.

72
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:11,120
It's just a fun time.

73
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,120
Yeah, that's the goal.

74
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,939
You guys ready?

75
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:18,689
You guys ready to hang out?

76
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:20,689
In this gigantic collective chat window?

77
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:23,959
While a 37-year-old

78
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,959
moron tries to

79
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,959
fucking build a house?

80
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,959
Alright, let's go!

81
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:33,410
I gotta give myself a little bit of credit.

82
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,410
I have like 120 IQ.

83
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,410
My performance IQ is like zero.

84
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,410
So, I'm not stupid.

85
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:48,870
Anyways, he's a genius.

86
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,870
I mean,

87
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,870
I mean, you said that. I didn't.

88
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,870
You said that.

89
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,389
But, blinking?

90
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:00,389
I guess so.

91
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:10,629
Thank you.

92
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:14,600
Alright, let's go. Yeah, you're gonna see.

93
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,839
I know, I start every single

94
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:19,329
time. I just want to check the audio.

95
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:21,329
This is not the color that I would want.

96
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:24,319
I just was testing

97
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:32,560
painting and everything again.

98
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,560
The DLC came out three days ago.

99
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,120
Alright, so we're good. I got time.

100
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,800
Why did you make the back rooms?

101
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,620
I just picked the first paint that I saw.

102
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,620
Alright, we're doing farming.

103
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:53,620
This is it right here. We did this one.

104
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,990
We did this one. I don't remember doing this

105
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,610
one, but I think we did. I don't know how eventful

106
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,600
this one was. Well, let's go.

107
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,920
Farm Flipper. It's a new map. Seems kinda

108
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:12,529
big. Alright, that's the one that's available.

109
00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:16,560
Let's do that one. Where is Molly?

110
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,319
If you're looking for the perfect couple,

111
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:21,319
visit our Joe and Lily

112
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,750
Inseparable since childhood, happily married and

113
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,750
good ranchers too. And yes,

114
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,750
Sury, they're doing so

115
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,949
good, yet the locals don't know what this

116
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:33,949
morning Joe and Lily found.

117
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:35,949
Their barn damaged

118
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:37,949
and their favorite cow Molly was gone.

119
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:40,379
The couple might be able to handle one of these

120
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:42,379
issues, but two at once

121
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:45,899
is too much. Let's go. What do we have to go

122
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:50,439
find the cow? This is huge

123
00:06:50,439 --> 00:07:03,420
drama. So what do I need to do?

124
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:09,310
Alright, let's go. There we are.

125
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:19,740
I'll take care of that.

126
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,980
That's easy.

127
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,480
The roof is gone.

128
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,980
Plane?

129
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,850
I got it. Don't worry. Where is

130
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,410
Molly?

131
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:48,250
This is just a Nancy Drew.

132
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,000
The Nancy Drew plot. Alright.

133
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,870
They got two. Wait.

134
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:11,100
There's a lot of stuff here. Could always just go on the

135
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,100
front door. Wait, I can't go in here.

136
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:21,230
Why am I not allowed in the house?

137
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,230
Oh, should I remove the drain pipe?

138
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:26,490
What are you doing over there

139
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,990
with the drain pipe?

140
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,550
I don't know. Just figured I would move

141
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:34,240
it. It's kind of an eyesore.

142
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,399
Oh look, I found a cow.

143
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,210
The game volume is a little low. I'll turn it

144
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:46,649
up. Keep it as a souvenir.

145
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:50,169
Alright, let me

146
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:56,429
go. Hold on.

147
00:08:56,429 --> 00:09:03,340
Where is it? I don't think the music has to be that loud.

148
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:10,700
How's this? Better?

149
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,580
The problem with House Flipper is some

150
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,580
sounds just explode.

151
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:21,340
Just be careful. We have to test

152
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:24,730
something. Some of this stuff is

153
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,730
so loud. So I'd just

154
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,730
be aware that it's the mixing

155
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,730
on this game was one of those things that was always kind of

156
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,970
off. I'll take out the sledgehammer

157
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,340
and it'll just be

158
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,340
I'll hit a wall and an explosion

159
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:40,159
happens. Oh, also too.

160
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:42,159
The limited

161
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:44,159
items in the Grotto Beast store are

162
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:46,159
leaving tonight.

163
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:51,279
Just to make sure everyone's aware of that.

164
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,769
Tonight at 12

165
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:55,769
at 11.59 PM Pacific

166
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:58,139
tonight, the posters

167
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,960
the

168
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,960
yeah, all three posters are

169
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,960
leaving the store.

170
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,960
The glow in the dark ghost shirt

171
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,580
and hoodie.

172
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,460
The glow in the dark one. The

173
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,639
original 40 shirt also

174
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,090
is going to be gone.

175
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,090
Is that what he just said?

176
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:23,919
I thought he said

177
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,139
there's a store. Yeah.

178
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:30,139
Yes, there is.

179
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:39,929
But anyways, yes, Grotto

180
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:48,059
Beasts dot net. I feel so

181
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:50,429
bad. Like, wait, what do

182
00:10:50,429 --> 00:10:52,429
you mean store? It's like, oh, shit, you don't know.

183
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:54,730
Well, it'll be there.

184
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:58,830
Yeah, you can keep that there for a little bit.

185
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:07,639
Okay, so let me let's clean

186
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:11,480
the fly noise. It was kind

187
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,620
of weird. This is one of my favorite parts

188
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,620
of the game. This is going to determine how loud it is, by the way.

189
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,100
That's not bad. Usually this

190
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:30,059
is pretty loud. It is loud.

191
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:33,120
Oh, well, it didn't look that loud.

192
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,080
All right, we're going to clean all this up.

193
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,259
But that's the task.

194
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:51,549
It doesn't need to look filled with water.

195
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:55,580
Where did I get that from?

196
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:59,039
Wait, you can have like farm

197
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:07,419
animals and stuff? What's your favorite?

198
00:12:07,419 --> 00:12:12,919
Vinny just used your likeness

199
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:14,919
on the screen. That's all right.

200
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:20,240
Vinny has expressed written permission.

201
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:28,090
Don't worry.

202
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:30,090
Yeah, Vinny has expressed

203
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:32,090
written permission to use my likeness.

204
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:46,039
Play the Home Depot

205
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:52,000
song. No.

206
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,840
Some of this still looks...

207
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,679
Is that shit?

208
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,679
Why would I use this? Like use as in...

209
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:03,679
What do you mean use? Oh,

210
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:05,679
I... All right. What?

211
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:08,559
Am I eating it?

212
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:11,629
Where is it going?

213
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:14,059
I probably shouldn't do that.

214
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:26,539
All right. Place a fence and gate. Remove

215
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:30,000
trash. Milk container.

216
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,840
Okay. Still dirt everywhere.

217
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,700
How is this still dirt?

218
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:43,049
Are all the windows down here clean? All right.

219
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:45,049
I think it's clean now.

220
00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:54,970
Wait, window. Looks pretty good.

221
00:13:54,970 --> 00:14:05,769
All right. I need a fence

222
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:11,600
and gate. So this

223
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,600
is in this room. So clean the dirt. Clean

224
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,600
the window is the way. There's one more window.

225
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,600
Oh, there's still tons of shit over there.

226
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:31,149
All right. That's three.

227
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:34,990
Oh, it's dirty up here. What's

228
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,990
the best way to find Mithril in Terraria?

229
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,870
Just take what you just wrote

230
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:46,799
and paste it

231
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:48,799
into a

232
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:50,799
search engine.

233
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:53,419
Wait, what?

234
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:57,639
How's the performing DLC?

235
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:01,740
What are you doing? What?

236
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,429
Germa, you haven't tweeted about GrottoBeast

237
00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:06,990
once. I've retweeted the GrottoBeast

238
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:15,440
account, though. That counts, isn't it?

239
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:22,799
That you're a fake fan.

240
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:30,539
This dude's farming L's.

241
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:32,539
Can I put this up? How do I make this...

242
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:34,539
Oh, rotate. There we go. Shift

243
00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:38,639
and what? I don't think I can move this.

244
00:15:38,639 --> 00:16:01,019
Oh, right here. I thought

245
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:03,960
my game crashed. Yeah. I mean, the thing

246
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,960
is, I don't really use

247
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,379
any social media, like, ever.

248
00:16:10,379 --> 00:16:12,379
Besides here and sometimes in

249
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:15,070
the Discord, I just

250
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,070
log off, dude. I just log

251
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,879
off. I just log

252
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:22,759
the fuck off. All right. That's good.

253
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:25,580
Wait. This is

254
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:37,929
still dirty. All right. Milk container.

255
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:40,679
All right. This is an enclosure.

256
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:43,309
How does this work?

257
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:58,519
Like this? There's a gate.

258
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:09,319
All right. Cool. Zero

259
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:16,109
percent. You just put a baby

260
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:22,250
gate there. Wait a minute. Hold on.

261
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:28,519
It wants me to put second floor

262
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:31,079
and then in this room here.

263
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:33,839
All right. Well, it wants me to replace the tiles

264
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:36,460
here. I can handle that.

265
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:46,509
Oh, he's farming L's.

266
00:17:46,509 --> 00:17:50,730
Weren't we going to start banning people that said that?

267
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:58,519
I always had the impression that we were going to start

268
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:00,519
banning people.

269
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:08,079
That's what it says in the title. Okay. Almost done.

270
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:17,660
Just the first person? Oh, well,

271
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,349
we can make this kind of funny, though.

272
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,349
So let's wait for someone

273
00:18:22,349 --> 00:18:24,349
to say it. And I'm talking like

274
00:18:24,349 --> 00:18:26,349
half hour from now when everyone isn't doing it

275
00:18:26,349 --> 00:18:30,380
anymore.

276
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:33,900
Just like ban somebody and just talk about, hey,

277
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,900
I've been live for like 13,

278
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,140
14 hours. And you

279
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,140
just ruined the streak. Nobody

280
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,140
said it. And we were talking about how nobody said it.

281
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:48,599
Like, wait, what? No, wait, nobody.

282
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:50,599
Not everybody said that?

283
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:52,839
No, I've been streaming for like 14 hours.

284
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:55,980
Sorry, but you get

285
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,119
banned. Place a fence and a

286
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:03,720
gate. How did I not do

287
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:33,920
that? Didn't I do it?

288
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,920
You have to build on the...

289
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,049
Dude, I thought this was

290
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:41,049
already here. I thought this was

291
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:43,049
way too filled in. All right?

292
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:45,049
I'm sorry. This is

293
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:47,049
filled in. It needs to be

294
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:49,049
way more transparent than that.

295
00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:51,049
This is a white fence.

296
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:53,049
I thought this was a white fence, guys.

297
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:56,380
I did...

298
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,710
All right. Whatever. I was like, this shit's

299
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:08,410
almost done. All right. Now he

300
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:23,200
is farming elves. Okay.

301
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,200
Someone needs to fill this dude's noggin.

302
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:34,160
That's so stupid.

303
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:43,559
I wanted to make a big gate.

304
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:58,650
All right, cool. That's done.

305
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:01,769
There's still dirt somewhere. That's

306
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:04,400
done. Okay, here we go.

307
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:10,539
Garage door. I want

308
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:12,539
to put it here so bad. I want to put

309
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:15,799
it right there. It's the poop,

310
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:44,400
dude. What the heck?

311
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
Dude, this... All right.

312
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,400
Isn't this supposed to be here?

313
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,569
No, that's supposed to be there.

314
00:21:50,569 --> 00:21:56,890
Okay. I need six fluorescent

315
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:03,420
lights. Guys, I'm not trying to make

316
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,420
this that wonderful looking.

317
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,420
I'm just trying to do the mission so we can unlock

318
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:44,670
the farming stuff. Crumb of a retweet

319
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:47,160
would be cool. It's only sponsors.

320
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,579
I just don't

321
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,579
use Twitter.

322
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:57,720
Like, for anything.

323
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,720
When I open up Twitter to... I didn't even take

324
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:09,000
a sip out of my tea yet. No, I'll tweet

325
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
out a Grotto Beast thing. You know, one of the things, once

326
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,180
the commercial was out, that was sort of

327
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,480
like the, all right, let's go.

328
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,359
There will be a Grotto Beast

329
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:26,410
tweet tonight. There will be.

330
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:42,970
Maybe back here? How many do we need? One or two?

331
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:47,000
Two? Ooh, cool.

332
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,259
Walk through that gate?

333
00:23:53,259 --> 00:24:00,170
I'm fine. I got it.

334
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:04,170
This is the kind of gate that hurts your hips

335
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:06,410
when you walk through it. This thing

336
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:08,410
scrapes bone when you walk

337
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:11,160
through this. You get wedged in

338
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,160
and... Ow! Okay.

339
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:22,700
My hips hurt. All right.

340
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:27,240
Some water?

341
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:36,970
Probably in here, right? How is a cow going to fit

342
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:38,970
through? We'll see. I'll fix it if I need to.

343
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:49,470
If I need to.

344
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,470
Somebody also...

345
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:54,460
In offline,

346
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,460
like free stream chat, offline chat

347
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,210
here, there'll be like, oh,

348
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:01,210
exclamation point, tweet.

349
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:03,950
And since, since

350
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,950
like the end of February, whatever

351
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,950
it was, it's been that Wild Hearts tweet.

352
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:10,759
It's been like two

353
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,759
straight months of Wild Hearts ad.

354
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:15,519
It's just been two months of an advertisement.

355
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:17,519
It's been there every single day.

356
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:19,519
Every single day

357
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:21,519
it's been there for like two or three

358
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:32,009
straight months. They're getting their

359
00:25:32,009 --> 00:25:40,779
money's worth? Yeah.

360
00:25:40,779 --> 00:25:43,339
That's so stupid. Fucking Twitter.

361
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:50,319
Every time I open up the Twitter app, I like

362
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:52,319
just blow the

363
00:25:52,319 --> 00:26:02,359
dust off. I need milk containers.

364
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:09,019
Oh, sell

365
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:11,019
the milk container.

366
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:15,630
Where are they? Oh, is this a milk container?

367
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:22,839
No? What is

368
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:33,079
a milk container? Oh, okay. That's

369
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:36,859
what I wanted to get rid of. So there's a

370
00:26:36,859 --> 00:26:38,859
milk container somewhere in here?

371
00:26:38,859 --> 00:26:42,299
It's not these, is it?

372
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:44,539
No, I like placed these.

373
00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:46,539
Where's these? What is two milk containers?

374
00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:48,839
Oh, it's these.

375
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:50,839
I thought I was looking. Okay. I was like, what the hell

376
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:54,170
does it want me to look for? Next to the door.

377
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:57,559
Oh,

378
00:26:57,559 --> 00:26:59,559
boy. We just got a raid

379
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:01,559
from Squeaks.

380
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:05,259
What's up, Squeaks? And what's up?

381
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:07,259
What do you call your

382
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:10,079
audience? The Squeak

383
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:13,660
Maniacs.

384
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:16,160
Thanks for the raid. We just started

385
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,700
playing some house flipper. Those of you that are

386
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,700
in this community that have not

387
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:26,279
followed Squeaks, stupid

388
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:28,720
behavior. No, Squeaks is

389
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:36,009
awesome. What do I have to do out here?

390
00:27:36,009 --> 00:27:41,579
Oh, oh my

391
00:27:41,579 --> 00:27:43,579
look, there's chickens.

392
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:49,880
What? What?

393
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,880
Follow me.

394
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,880
What? Hold on.

395
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,880
Can I have like just a bunch of chickens follow me

396
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,880
around and help me? How many can I have

397
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:15,339
at one time? Cool.

398
00:28:15,339 --> 00:28:23,150
Did you see the coffee bit Squeaks

399
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,150
did on stream a few days? Yes, I did.

400
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:28,089
It's classic. Pour

401
00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:30,089
something out as if you're pouring it

402
00:28:30,089 --> 00:28:32,089
onto your desk, but it goes into another container.

403
00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:34,089
And then you pour that container out.

404
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:36,089
Oh, unbelievably classic.

405
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:44,029
You left it open? Oh, shit, I did.

406
00:28:44,029 --> 00:28:50,170
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Everybody follow

407
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:54,839
No, no, I'll lose them. I'm not

408
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:56,839
ready for this, but I am ready for like in a couple hours

409
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:58,839
to have like 300. Like, I'm just

410
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:00,839
gonna have like a chicken army walk around with me.

411
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:12,480
I'm back in here. Okay.

412
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,289
Stop following me.

413
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:17,289
Can I give a treat? What is this?

414
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:20,559
Really? What could I do?

415
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,559
Minus one sunflower. Is it bad?

416
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:27,930
Grass is kind of tall in here.

417
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:44,039
You guys hungry? Okay, I gotta

418
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:46,039
make sure no one's following me. I don't want them to be stuck.

419
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:49,180
There were three following me. It was

420
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,869
these three, right? Alright, we're good.

421
00:29:51,869 --> 00:30:04,279
That's cool. I'm gonna

422
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:17,660
blame that on somebody else. They want a

423
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:20,410
different window up here.

424
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:31,359
Can I break this? What did I just

425
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:33,660
do?

426
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,660
This might be loud. I'm warning you.

427
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,029
This is actually, this is probably gonna be loud. We need to test

428
00:30:38,029 --> 00:30:40,029
and see. This is the loudest object in the whole game. Just be

429
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:48,220
aware of this. Is there, do I have a ladder?

430
00:30:48,220 --> 00:31:02,220
Wait a minute.

431
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,569
Use tool grappling hook? Where's

432
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:17,000
a grappling hook? Grappling hook?

433
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:34,349
Flashlight, jump,

434
00:31:34,349 --> 00:31:36,349
crouch, run. Grapple,

435
00:31:36,349 --> 00:31:44,990
it's in the wheel? Oh, wait.

436
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:46,990
Wait a minute. Whoa, drone.

437
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:50,380
Oh my god. Okay.

438
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:57,359
Hold on. That's pretty cool. That's

439
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:59,359
new. That wasn't in the game before.

440
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:13,099
Alright, I'm warning you. This is loud.

441
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:15,099
I'm warning you. Please turn your volume down.

442
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:18,880
We need to test and see how loud it is.

443
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,309
And I knew it. I knew it was gonna be loud.

444
00:32:21,309 --> 00:32:30,910
Okay, I need to upgrade

445
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:34,089
to

446
00:32:34,089 --> 00:32:36,779
more faster demolition. I don't have any

447
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:39,789
of my old points, but it's alright.

448
00:32:39,789 --> 00:32:41,789
Okay, so we need beds.

449
00:32:41,789 --> 00:32:47,099
Get a couple of these.

450
00:32:49,339 --> 00:32:51,339
Buckets, whatever.

451
00:32:51,339 --> 00:33:27,279
Maybe these are dirty. Okay.

452
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:45,000
How am I gonna fit three of these?

453
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Dude, get rid of the huge

454
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,039
pile of shit.

455
00:33:51,039 --> 00:34:04,920
That's not just poop, isn't this?

456
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,920
I don't know why I was thinking of that. I didn't

457
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,099
finish my thought. There's another squeaks bit that was

458
00:34:09,099 --> 00:34:11,400
really funny for all the

459
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,039
squeak maniacs that are here.

460
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:17,400
When he had the thing

461
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,400
transcribing him talking

462
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,030
and he muted his mic and just started

463
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:24,030
talking shit. And he was just

464
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:26,030
transcribing everything he said.

465
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:31,789
Pretty good. They're already gone.

466
00:34:31,789 --> 00:34:35,949
Oh, well, whatever.

467
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:38,570
So why can't I place this?

468
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:40,570
Do I have to break all this first?

469
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:52,599
Yeah, see, it's like, oh, it needs to be bigger.

470
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:56,250
How do I replace this?

471
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:59,389
Sell it? Yes.

472
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:06,940
Loud. Incoming.

473
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:11,849
Oh, cool.

474
00:35:11,849 --> 00:35:16,519
That's good. Look at this.

475
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:18,519
Look at how clean it is and look at how nice

476
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:47,519
it is.

477
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:49,519
Dude, it's 3am and we shouldn't be mowing.

478
00:35:49,519 --> 00:36:07,739
Alright, I did it. Look at that.

479
00:36:07,739 --> 00:36:10,110
So much cleaner.

480
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,800
All the lights are on the ground.

481
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,800
Oh, I

482
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,480
didn't do shit on the ceiling.

483
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,480
Uh, whoops, forgot that

484
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:27,039
was the thing I had to do.

485
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:41,309
Back home. You've received the

486
00:36:41,309 --> 00:36:43,309
architect tool. Congratulations.

487
00:36:43,309 --> 00:36:45,309
You've unlocked a new tool. From now on

488
00:36:45,309 --> 00:36:47,309
you can build structures.

489
00:36:47,309 --> 00:36:51,530
I've been playing this game for six, seven,

490
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:55,050
eight years. It's been a long time coming

491
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:58,829
for this. From now on you can build structures. Use

492
00:36:58,829 --> 00:37:00,829
the architect tool and place the foundation

493
00:37:00,829 --> 00:37:02,829
on the ground, then select its borders

494
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:05,639
and give it a desired shape. Okay.

495
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:07,639
Finally press the E key to erect the building.

496
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:11,659
New tool. To plot a field

497
00:37:11,659 --> 00:37:13,659
select a hoe from the tools menu.

498
00:37:13,659 --> 00:37:15,659
Choose a field with Q plus

499
00:37:15,659 --> 00:37:18,409
that middle mouse button

500
00:37:18,409 --> 00:37:44,010
and click on the ground. Okay.

501
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:48,809
House building. Paint

502
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:50,809
gun. What's the paint gun?

503
00:37:50,809 --> 00:37:54,460
What? Okay.

504
00:37:54,460 --> 00:38:00,159
Most of these tools are new.

505
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:14,429
Just go back here. Okay. Paint gun.

506
00:38:14,429 --> 00:38:21,710
Alright. Change size.

507
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:32,139
Well, this is way faster.

508
00:38:32,139 --> 00:38:44,800
That's so much faster.

509
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,739
Okay, cool. What about the drone?

510
00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:57,400
Alright, where am I? Am I the drone?

511
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:13,920
Can I fly the drone in the house?

512
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,800
You can. Okay, that's weird.

513
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:27,679
What happened? What the fuck?

514
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:29,679
That thing's a cheap piece of shit.

515
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:39,769
That thing's a piece of shit. Alright, what's the next

516
00:39:39,769 --> 00:39:44,440
mission? 89 missions

517
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,519
to do on Happy Ranch.

518
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:53,210
Huh? Wait, I can just buy one?

519
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:55,210
Wait, what do you mean I can buy a

520
00:39:55,210 --> 00:40:24,960
cow? Why?

521
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,320
I'm just looking out and there

522
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:32,380
is a cow here. Okay.

523
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,380
Well, follow me because you should probably be in the...

524
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:39,440
Oh, this is a bad idea. Can I make a

525
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,440
bed? I need to make a cow bed.

526
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:53,000
Can you fit in here? Wait, goats?

527
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,559
Pigs? Horses? Sheep?

528
00:40:55,559 --> 00:41:05,480
They have different personalities.

529
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:13,039
Alright, if I have like

530
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:15,039
three alpacas, four cows,

531
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,599
and like two goats,

532
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,599
the neighborhood is going to...

533
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:25,929
Oh my god. Okay, we're good.

534
00:41:25,929 --> 00:41:28,300
Okay, we need a spot for you.

535
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,909
This is not big enough. You need a way

536
00:41:30,909 --> 00:41:33,849
bigger space than this. No, fuck my

537
00:41:33,849 --> 00:41:35,849
bed. I don't care. We'll get...

538
00:41:35,849 --> 00:41:38,599
You need more room. No, fuck this.

539
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:44,730
Loud incoming. Oh, I can't...

540
00:41:44,730 --> 00:42:12,239
Hold on. 500 bucks?

541
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:19,719
How do I... It's $3,000.

542
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:21,719
I'm working on it. I'm trying.

543
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:31,369
Hold on, you gotta get out of the way.

544
00:42:31,369 --> 00:42:39,309
You can't go this way. You have to wait.

545
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:41,309
This is like wet concrete. Watch out.

546
00:42:56,889 --> 00:43:01,630
I got a new skill. Design interior

547
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:04,760
walls, yes. Okay.

548
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:09,099
Building modification.

549
00:43:09,099 --> 00:43:11,280
Oh, that is so cute.

550
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,010
Alright, come on out. Edit inner...

551
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,570
Select two... Press and select

552
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:20,570
two points to edit inner walls.

553
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:30,349
Points? I guess that...

554
00:43:30,349 --> 00:43:35,150
How do I... Because I can move the edges,

555
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:37,579
but how do I carve off internal...

556
00:43:37,579 --> 00:43:46,010
I guess. Alright, well we're both in here now.

557
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:55,099
Click and drag. I tried that. It didn't work.

558
00:43:55,099 --> 00:44:05,840
I can't break it. Okay. Building

559
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:11,789
modification. Okay, now...

560
00:44:11,789 --> 00:44:14,219
So I want to do this. Ah, alright.

561
00:44:14,219 --> 00:44:16,219
There we go. Okay, okay. I get it.

562
00:44:16,219 --> 00:44:21,449
This is the... This is where you can come in.

563
00:44:21,449 --> 00:44:24,519
And you'll have a little spot.

564
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:29,630
Alright, good. Let's make a door.

565
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:38,519
Alright, this is going to be...

566
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:42,489
I need a door. Yeah, like a garage door.

567
00:44:42,489 --> 00:45:02,119
Got to be big enough. You're okay?

568
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:08,840
It's like a car

569
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,840
garage. I know, but it'll...

570
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,789
You put a cow

571
00:45:13,789 --> 00:45:15,789
in your garage. Dude, just wait.

572
00:45:15,789 --> 00:45:18,349
Rome wasn't built in a day.

573
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:31,449
Took Rome at least a few months.

574
00:45:31,449 --> 00:45:35,480
Alright, what else do you need as an animal?

575
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,980
Pantry? Animal products.

576
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:43,230
Everything. Okay, what do

577
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:47,369
cows eat? Hey, right?

578
00:45:47,369 --> 00:46:08,559
Cows eat carrots? Cows eat carrots?

579
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:20,960
It is Otto.

580
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,960
In case you get hungry, there's a carrot snack

581
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,590
right there. This needs to be much bigger.

582
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:28,590
It's going to be way more comfortable than this.

583
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:30,590
Yeah, this is not... I don't like it

584
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:55,679
either. Uh-uh. Alright,

585
00:46:55,679 --> 00:47:04,239
that's better. Okay, E.

586
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:11,210
E. I need like barn outdoor.

587
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:18,619
Okay, walls.

588
00:47:18,619 --> 00:47:21,949
Wall panels, right?

589
00:47:21,949 --> 00:47:24,119
It needs to be kind of like

590
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:40,360
like a barn. Like this?

591
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:47,199
Like wood? Like one of these? These

592
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:51,920
look okay. That'll be nice. Like red.

593
00:47:51,920 --> 00:48:02,599
It's going to take a lot to do this because

594
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:17,000
my skill point is literally zero. Change

595
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:23,079
size? Oh, I can't. You need

596
00:48:23,079 --> 00:48:40,170
one acre per cow.

597
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:58,599
I want to open windows and stuff. No,

598
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:00,599
it's not going to be a concrete room.

599
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:02,599
I have to finish the inside

600
00:49:02,599 --> 00:49:06,570
first. No, you know what? I need to do my

601
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:12,650
missions, first of all. I've...

602
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:20,059
What? How?

603
00:49:20,059 --> 00:49:26,079
What? Oh my goodness. This milk?

604
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:40,349
Alright, I... Hey.

605
00:49:40,349 --> 00:49:42,349
Um, I wasn't ready.

606
00:49:42,349 --> 00:49:47,449
Needs. No needs right now.

607
00:49:47,449 --> 00:49:58,079
Alright, I need to put like hay down or something.

608
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:07,480
No shot the HOA will allow this.

609
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:13,230
Is this shit? There's no way.

610
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:33,630
Alright. Okay, I need to...

611
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:35,630
I'm going to move you to the animal hotel.

612
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:40,489
I can't take care of a cow right now.

613
00:50:40,489 --> 00:50:47,530
Look, I got all this shit to do.

614
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:49,530
Are you going to go to a farm where you can be

615
00:50:49,530 --> 00:51:02,440
taking care of properly? Horses?

616
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,940
You sell? I didn't sell. I did not sell.

617
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:06,940
The cow went to the

618
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,940
um, like the animal, like

619
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:14,639
farm hotel thing. I think I can go back

620
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:17,389
and get that cow later.

621
00:51:48,199 --> 00:51:54,539
Do I have to actually

622
00:51:54,539 --> 00:51:58,380
get horses here?

623
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:00,380
How does this work?

624
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:21,000
How does this work?

625
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:44,670
Oh, okay.

626
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:46,670
Oh shit, it's going to roll into the...

627
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:48,670
Somebody's... Whoa! There it goes.

628
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:52,059
I actually just took out... That would have been bad.

629
00:52:52,059 --> 00:53:00,489
Just...

630
00:53:00,489 --> 00:53:04,519
Okay, wait. How many do you want me to take down?

631
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:06,519
Cut down tree... Oh, these...

632
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:16,760
Wait. Where are the... Where are the ones

633
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:20,989
you must cut down? Oh,

634
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:38,269
oops. Sorry about that. I want to try to use

635
00:53:38,269 --> 00:53:45,369
the axe too. How does the axe work?

636
00:53:45,369 --> 00:53:47,369
No, we just only use chainsaw.

637
00:53:47,369 --> 00:53:52,750
Alright, put this down. Alright, lay foundation.

638
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:54,750
So you want me to put down a foundation

639
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:57,559
here. I need to build

640
00:53:57,559 --> 00:54:01,150
a stable. Okay.

641
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:25,710
Let's go.

642
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:34,539
Alright, done? Cool. So now...

643
00:54:34,539 --> 00:54:40,110
Oh, I'm so glad there's a guide.

644
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,119
Alright, so now we need to make a stable.

645
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:46,760
Knee, knee horse

646
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:54,250
box gate. You want the gray

647
00:54:54,250 --> 00:55:01,420
tile? Okay. Do this first.

648
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:15,099
You should do this IRL.

649
00:55:15,099 --> 00:55:19,900
I just want to make sure you understand that.

650
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:25,519
Like, I don't...

651
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:29,159
I would probably get seriously injured.

652
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,789
You want me to build a house?

653
00:55:31,789 --> 00:55:34,030
Like, build this?

654
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:43,099
Huh? Yeah.

655
00:55:43,099 --> 00:55:58,380
Okay, that looks good.

656
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:00,380
Somebody said caveman. I could make some caveman

657
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:02,380
level stuff, but not like this.

658
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:04,380
You need skill training

659
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:10,679
and safety.

660
00:56:10,679 --> 00:56:12,679
Okay, so I need to get this.

661
00:56:12,679 --> 00:56:15,239
This interior has got to be way better

662
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:26,960
than this. Three of these?

663
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:41,210
Is that not counting it? Why is it only counting

664
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:59,199
one? I don't think I can make it perfect.

665
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:15,960
Zero out of four?

666
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:18,199
Wait, why did it...what?

667
00:57:18,199 --> 00:57:24,460
Alright, this is not

668
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:35,280
a me problem. I can't

669
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:40,010
get it perfect. Put the pillars first.

670
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:56,510
Try that.

671
00:57:56,510 --> 00:58:08,920
Alright, that counted.

672
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,920
Jeremy, your problem solving skills suck.

673
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:17,710
This was one out of four.

674
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:20,269
I picked it up and put it down in the same spot

675
00:58:20,269 --> 00:58:22,889
and it went to zero out of four.

676
00:58:22,889 --> 00:58:25,199
The instructions were incorrect.

677
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:47,769
There we go. That's a dad excuse.

678
00:58:47,769 --> 00:58:50,909
The instructions

679
00:58:50,909 --> 00:58:59,929
were not correct. It's really not

680
00:58:59,929 --> 00:59:01,929
hard. No, it's not.

681
00:59:01,929 --> 00:59:07,420
I just did it. It's

682
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:11,449
kind of finicky. How come I wasn't doing this

683
00:59:11,449 --> 00:59:13,449
too...okay, so the pillars definitely had to be

684
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:15,449
here. Because it would not let me go

685
00:59:15,449 --> 00:59:17,449
in this exact spot before.

686
00:59:17,449 --> 00:59:19,449
Before it was like I could only place it like here.

687
00:59:19,449 --> 00:59:32,760
Am I missing tiles somewhere?

688
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:46,889
Oh, come on. Okay.

689
00:59:46,889 --> 00:59:53,550
So this thing is

690
00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:59,289
for here.

691
00:59:59,289 --> 01:00:01,719
Oh, that was a lag spike. Wait, what does it want this?

692
01:00:01,719 --> 01:00:04,599
Half box wall.

693
01:00:04,599 --> 01:00:27,949
Wait, let me do that first.

694
01:00:27,949 --> 01:01:00,960
Oh, please. Change

695
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,960
the music. This is the music in the game.

696
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:07,630
And this thing goes hard.

697
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:15,119
I'm keeping it on. No, we can't replace

698
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:17,119
every soundtrack with Doom

699
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:37,340
OST. Alright, so these are the

700
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:42,079
windows. Horse mats.

701
01:01:42,079 --> 01:02:11,360
Okay. Four of these, right? Okay.

702
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:18,519
So what now?

703
01:02:18,519 --> 01:02:23,519
Two of these go here. No.

704
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:34,250
Smash. I'm starting to understand

705
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:42,559
it. I think I can make my own farm.

706
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:53,039
Looks pretty clean. Where's

707
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:57,000
the door? I'll worry about that later.

708
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:03,320
Look, there's a door. Oh, that's

709
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:05,320
not a door. That's a giant

710
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,320
window. Where is the door?

711
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:29,530
Wait, where's the door? I need a

712
01:03:29,530 --> 01:03:33,690
door. Sliding gate.

713
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:45,900
Hey, we're good.

714
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:48,909
Now, ceiling lamp.

715
01:03:48,909 --> 01:03:53,960
Empty shelf with horse care equipment.

716
01:03:53,960 --> 01:04:03,230
I don't know, put it like right here. How many

717
01:04:03,230 --> 01:04:20,250
horse feeders for? This looks like

718
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:25,050
my high school?

719
01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:29,280
What?

720
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:36,570
What are you talking about? Are you

721
01:04:36,570 --> 01:04:42,269
a horse?

722
01:04:42,269 --> 01:04:44,269
This looks just like my high

723
01:04:44,269 --> 01:04:56,039
school. Alright, that looks good.

724
01:04:56,039 --> 01:05:06,780
I'm starting to get it. So

725
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:08,780
it's a Minecraft house. Somebody

726
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:10,780
came into this universe with the Minecraft tools.

727
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:17,239
My game got

728
01:05:17,239 --> 01:05:19,800
hacked by some like Minecraft player.

729
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:21,800
And they're just building in my game.

730
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:35,360
Okay. So now

731
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:41,050
I want us to see the

732
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:43,050
just in case we get introduced into the

733
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:51,480
gameplay mechanic.

734
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,849
Um, I think I'm going to buy it.

735
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:58,010
I got money. Let's buy the new house.

736
01:05:58,010 --> 01:06:01,199
Cabin in the woods.

737
01:06:01,199 --> 01:06:03,199
A remote getaway in the heart of the mountains.

738
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:05,369
An easy sell. Just needs a little love to

739
01:06:05,369 --> 01:06:07,369
become the site of a joyful family gathering

740
01:06:07,369 --> 01:06:09,369
once again. Or anything else you'd like it to be.

741
01:06:09,369 --> 01:06:19,019
I'm buying it. Let's check it out.

742
01:06:19,019 --> 01:06:23,309
This is the new house in the update.

743
01:06:23,309 --> 01:06:40,760
This place is very dirty. Garden

744
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:43,199
con- oh, that's right. Alright.

745
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:47,530
It's time for the game to begin. What do I

746
01:06:47,530 --> 01:06:50,409
got for- ooh. What do I got for

747
01:06:50,409 --> 01:06:54,570
space in this lot? First thing is first.

748
01:06:54,570 --> 01:07:01,789
Yeah, we'll change the music. Yeah.

749
01:07:01,789 --> 01:07:04,860
I didn't want to hear it another time. Uh.

750
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:06,860
Hey, how's Doom

751
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:13,119
OST sound?

752
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:22,519
No, something else. Something else.

753
01:07:22,519 --> 01:07:31,659
Something else. Ooh, it's raining.

754
01:07:31,659 --> 01:07:33,659
Ooh, this is going to be so fucking

755
01:07:33,659 --> 01:07:38,909
relaxing. I can't wait.

756
01:07:38,909 --> 01:07:41,849
Stardew Valley music? That's not a bad

757
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:46,719
thing to put on. Stardew

758
01:07:46,719 --> 01:07:51,000
OST. Yeah, it's like just

759
01:07:51,000 --> 01:08:01,119
so, it's just so nice.

760
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:08,989
How's that? Good? I want to be

761
01:08:08,989 --> 01:08:19,420
nice and in the background.

762
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:27,039
Okay. I'm going to plant my own trees,

763
01:08:27,039 --> 01:08:31,710
I think. Can you?

764
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:34,460
Alright. Well, that's fine. First,

765
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:36,460
most important thing, we've

766
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:38,460
got to clean this up. This

767
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:40,460
yaw has got to be a grass

768
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:53,130
cut.

769
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:55,500
Stardew music

770
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,500
in the background.

771
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:02,939
I feel like I'm going to mess something up if I do it that

772
01:09:02,939 --> 01:09:16,699
way. I'm going to turn these sounds down

773
01:09:16,699 --> 01:09:27,960
just a little bit. Lawn mowing

774
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,960
simulator. Oh, I still want to change the auto

775
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:35,000
saving. How do I do that?

776
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Click save. Three minutes. Yeah.

777
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Like 30, 15

778
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,460
is good. Every three minutes

779
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:51,279
is a lot. Okay, here we go.

780
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:53,279
Ah, this is what I'm talking about.

781
01:09:53,279 --> 01:10:00,000
This way we can get

782
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,899
rid of all the weeds. I should get some upgrades

783
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:11,710
for doing this. You like firehouse

784
01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:15,399
subs? Yeah. Firehouse

785
01:10:15,399 --> 01:10:17,399
is good. I've had it a few times before.

786
01:10:17,399 --> 01:10:33,770
Let me move this back here.

787
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:36,520
I got a big lot. It's going to take me a minute.

788
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:43,159
Look at those mountains. It already looks

789
01:10:43,159 --> 01:10:57,949
10 times better. Okay.

790
01:10:57,949 --> 01:11:14,510
It's burnt? It is burnt.

791
01:11:14,510 --> 01:11:17,710
Oh, no.

792
01:11:17,710 --> 01:11:22,510
Yeah, it is burnt. Can I restart?

793
01:11:22,510 --> 01:11:30,380
Yeah, it's all burnt up. Will that get

794
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:32,380
fixed, I think? I can plant some stuff there.

795
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:36,140
I'll make that. We'll turn

796
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:38,140
that into like some kind of pen or something.

797
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:49,579
Yeah, what does it replant? It's fine.

798
01:11:49,579 --> 01:11:51,579
Can you make a koi pond?

799
01:11:51,579 --> 01:12:01,760
Try. Where are the pigs? Hurry up and

800
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:06,159
spawn them in. Patience.

801
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:09,420
Yeah, usually I'm the one without the patience.

802
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:11,420
We need to prepare our pen.

803
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:14,430
We can make sure our animals are taken very good

804
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:23,260
care of. All right, that's good enough

805
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:25,949
enough. I want to see the- what's the damage

806
01:12:25,949 --> 01:12:34,460
in the interior?

807
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:51,399
Oof. Oh, dear.

808
01:12:51,399 --> 01:13:00,989
Oh, boy. All right, we're working

809
01:13:00,989 --> 01:13:03,289
from top- we're working

810
01:13:03,289 --> 01:13:21,720
top down. Looks good.

811
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:23,720
What is all this? Oh, no. Get rid of this.

812
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:36,649
Now, what if all the animals

813
01:13:36,649 --> 01:13:38,649
lived in the house and I lived in the barn?

814
01:13:38,649 --> 01:13:54,569
Like, they live in the house.

815
01:13:54,569 --> 01:13:56,569
That's just an 80s comedy.

816
01:13:56,569 --> 01:14:04,039
Yeah, that's all right. Yeah, I want

817
01:14:04,039 --> 01:14:06,039
I want the pig to have an office.

818
01:14:06,039 --> 01:14:18,119
What's going on with this thing?

819
01:14:18,119 --> 01:14:23,289
Junk. Get rid of it. Junk. Junk.

820
01:14:23,289 --> 01:14:33,899
This one's pretty good. It's kind

821
01:14:33,899 --> 01:14:41,579
of dreary in here. Whose room is this

822
01:14:41,579 --> 01:14:46,119
going to be? By the way, we can get

823
01:14:46,119 --> 01:14:50,409
Whose room is this going to be? Should be the pig's

824
01:14:50,409 --> 01:14:52,840
room? Who would want a good view like this?

825
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:58,649
A goat? All right, so this is going to be a goat

826
01:14:58,649 --> 01:15:11,180
room. What do you think we'll paint?

827
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:16,939
Let's start from the bottom. Floor. Carpet?

828
01:15:16,939 --> 01:15:32,989
Can we put grass up here? It kind of looks like

829
01:15:32,989 --> 01:15:41,479
grass. Nah.

830
01:15:41,479 --> 01:15:45,760
Farming. Whoa!

831
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:58,279
It really is Stardew.

832
01:15:58,279 --> 01:16:00,279
All right, where do I want my, what am I growing?

833
01:16:00,279 --> 01:16:04,619
Right here. All right, I want to make

834
01:16:04,619 --> 01:16:06,800
a bunch of sunflowers.

835
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,680
So I need to, what was it? It was a

836
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:20,600
certain tool, right? Yep, here it is.

837
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:23,159
Corn's going to go here. No, sunflower will go

838
01:16:23,159 --> 01:16:50,489
here. Make a corn maze.

839
01:16:50,489 --> 01:16:54,649
All right, I'll do that in the backyard.

840
01:16:54,649 --> 01:17:03,930
That's a good idea. I like that. Yeah,

841
01:17:03,930 --> 01:17:05,930
I'll make like a tower defense

842
01:17:05,930 --> 01:17:07,930
pathing thing over there.

843
01:17:07,930 --> 01:17:11,520
You have to walk through and then go

844
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,520
this way and then there's a huge tower defense maze.

845
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:20,539
But first of all, sunflower seeds.

846
01:17:20,539 --> 01:17:23,229
So where do I put them?

847
01:17:23,229 --> 01:17:26,920
Is that it? Do I have to water them too?

848
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:38,699
Plants versus zombies map?

849
01:17:38,699 --> 01:17:41,640
Yeah, I could do two rows of sunflowers

850
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:44,649
and then just, that's a good idea too.

851
01:17:44,649 --> 01:17:56,109
All right, so if that's the sunflowers

852
01:17:56,109 --> 01:17:58,800
then what would go right in front of it?

853
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:03,720
Pumpkins, carrots.

854
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:07,819
I think this is it. We've got tomatoes,

855
01:18:07,819 --> 01:18:10,430
pumpkins, potatoes, corn

856
01:18:10,430 --> 01:18:17,079
and carrots. Tomatoes, right?

857
01:18:17,079 --> 01:18:20,800
Corn makes, we're doing a plants versus zombies

858
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:28,159
thing. This is in the game. What just happened?

859
01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:45,550
Did I just plant corn here? Okay.

860
01:18:45,550 --> 01:18:52,119
Let's have it come out a little bit further.

861
01:18:52,119 --> 01:18:54,119
I also have to put a bunch of bad placement

862
01:18:54,119 --> 01:18:56,119
because when I played plants versus zombies it was terrible

863
01:18:56,119 --> 01:18:58,619
placement so we're going to have like two or three

864
01:18:58,619 --> 01:19:00,619
pumpkins and then two or three corns and then

865
01:19:00,619 --> 01:19:14,250
yeah, we'll make sure it's accurate. What happens

866
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:16,680
if you torch it all? Then it all goes away?

867
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:25,520
I don't want to do that. Got one row corn,

868
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:28,010
two rows sunflowers.

869
01:19:28,010 --> 01:19:31,210
Does anything look like a walnut? Probably

870
01:19:31,210 --> 01:19:37,869
the pumpkin I would imagine.

871
01:19:37,869 --> 01:19:39,869
There's a zombie

872
01:19:39,869 --> 01:19:41,869
in my lawn.

873
01:19:41,869 --> 01:19:43,869
There's a zombie.

874
01:19:43,869 --> 01:20:08,430
Walnut, walnut down here

875
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:12,079
and then we'll put

876
01:20:12,079 --> 01:20:15,279
a couple more

877
01:20:15,279 --> 01:20:19,949
we'll do a couple more corns like just kind of scattered

878
01:20:19,949 --> 01:20:21,949
in a row like right here.

879
01:20:21,949 --> 01:20:47,979
We'll see how that turns out. I just want

880
01:20:47,979 --> 01:20:55,149
to see what it did.

881
01:20:55,149 --> 01:20:57,149
We're thinking way too, hold on

882
01:20:57,149 --> 01:21:17,949
I need to water this stuff. Maybe you don't.

883
01:21:17,949 --> 01:21:23,000
Hey, it's a process.

884
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,590
We didn't get right to the

885
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:28,590
Best Buy. We didn't get right to

886
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:31,079
the mall a few years

887
01:21:31,079 --> 01:21:35,050
ago. The process is we get

888
01:21:35,050 --> 01:21:37,050
we will

889
01:21:37,050 --> 01:21:39,050
we, we, we

890
01:21:39,050 --> 01:21:52,430
I want all new stuff.

891
01:21:52,430 --> 01:21:57,159
Now you bet your ass there's going to be a

892
01:21:57,159 --> 01:21:59,159
like four by foot

893
01:21:59,159 --> 01:22:01,159
four by five whatever foot

894
01:22:01,159 --> 01:22:04,170
square footed, square pool.

895
01:22:04,170 --> 01:22:15,560
I want a square pool.

896
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:17,560
I don't know is it five by five? Is it

897
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:25,310
eight by eight? How big is it?

898
01:22:25,310 --> 01:22:41,239
Wait, getting ahead of myself. Four by five

899
01:22:41,239 --> 01:22:45,920
is fine for you. Permanently ban that

900
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,350
person for an hour and then reduce

901
01:22:48,350 --> 01:22:52,060
their sentence by 55 minutes and leave

902
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:57,439
them a stern message. All right, let's start

903
01:22:57,439 --> 01:22:59,439
with doing one room at a time and

904
01:22:59,439 --> 01:23:02,250
let me tell you I don't like that at all.

905
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:05,130
I don't like that at all and I don't like that

906
01:23:05,130 --> 01:23:08,399
light. So if this was if I'm coming up the

907
01:23:08,399 --> 01:23:11,210
stairs here I would probably say this

908
01:23:11,210 --> 01:23:14,090
is a

909
01:23:14,090 --> 01:23:16,649
could be like an office or something or could be

910
01:23:16,649 --> 01:23:25,039
a bedroom. Floor is important. What do I want

911
01:23:25,039 --> 01:23:30,409
on the floor up here? There are beehives.

912
01:23:30,409 --> 01:23:55,100
Do I have to do anything with them?

913
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:57,100
Is there any like special interactions?

914
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:59,659
This might just be aesthetic.

915
01:23:59,659 --> 01:24:01,659
I don't think it actually does anything.

916
01:24:01,659 --> 01:24:20,520
Okay, one thing at a time. Let's go

917
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:22,520
to floors.

918
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:27,770
We'll just do wood. Doesn't matter.

919
01:24:27,770 --> 01:24:35,069
I don't like wood floors though.

920
01:24:35,069 --> 01:24:41,000
I really don't. Too much to upkeep.

921
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,689
You can fuck them up. You can scratch them up.

922
01:24:43,689 --> 01:24:58,479
I don't like it. Green tiles are fine.

923
01:24:58,479 --> 01:25:04,239
I don't mind this.

924
01:25:04,239 --> 01:25:15,470
What does this look like? It's not a farmhouse

925
01:25:15,470 --> 01:25:18,090
without wood. That's true.

926
01:25:18,090 --> 01:25:32,800
I need some light in here. Something really basic.

927
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:44,409
Eater. There it is.

928
01:25:44,409 --> 01:25:48,250
No, there it is. That's the exact

929
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:52,090
one that I want. Yeah, that is

930
01:25:52,090 --> 01:25:55,100
exactly the one.

931
01:25:55,100 --> 01:26:01,439
And I want this shit to be teal.

932
01:26:01,439 --> 01:26:07,880
Yup. There it is.

933
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:17,149
Oh my goodness. Yes.

934
01:26:17,149 --> 01:26:23,800
Where can I put this? I don't care

935
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:25,800
if my whole house looks like this.

936
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:27,800
As long as I got my square pool.

937
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:32,729
That's all I care about. Does it have to be

938
01:26:32,729 --> 01:26:42,140
in the yard? I think it has to be outside.

939
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:52,880
Not enough room. It's not enough

940
01:26:52,880 --> 01:27:02,029
room. Yeah, it said it. How come I can't

941
01:27:02,029 --> 01:27:07,979
put it in there? There's plenty of room.

942
01:27:07,979 --> 01:27:14,939
Look at all the room right here. How come I can't

943
01:27:14,939 --> 01:27:19,800
It doesn't have to go up against a wall.

944
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:25,180
There's plenty of space here. Because it's on

945
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:27,180
the second floor. So, what? I can't

946
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:30,960
have a second floor square pool? Bullshit.

947
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:56,600
Let's pick all this up. I might just

948
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:59,420
put it in the kitchen. Wait a minute. This is not even my house.

949
01:27:59,420 --> 01:28:06,270
We're doing the

950
01:28:06,270 --> 01:28:08,270
switching. We're switching around here. The animals

951
01:28:08,270 --> 01:28:29,130
are gonna live in here. We just gotta clear everything first.

952
01:28:29,130 --> 01:28:31,819
Get a good look at exactly how

953
01:28:31,819 --> 01:28:46,590
the whole thing is set up. Okay.

954
01:28:46,590 --> 01:29:00,270
Clean up. I do work at a hotel

955
01:29:00,270 --> 01:29:04,939
and the pool is on the 10th floor.

956
01:29:04,939 --> 01:29:10,119
Yeah, that's also a hotel though. Alright.

957
01:29:10,119 --> 01:29:13,130
Now, just clean up first.

958
01:29:13,130 --> 01:29:15,949
I keep getting distracted and that's

959
01:29:15,949 --> 01:29:27,840
gonna stop. Just clean up. I can't wait to see the

960
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:30,460
before and after after this one. It's gonna be so awesome.

961
01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:49,180
Open. What's in there? This place

962
01:29:49,180 --> 01:29:56,159
is kind of like gross.

963
01:29:56,159 --> 01:30:07,869
I aired out a little. I want some more cleaning points.

964
01:30:07,869 --> 01:30:11,819
This map is kind of low

965
01:30:11,819 --> 01:30:23,000
on the list here. Where's this

966
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:31,180
dirt? See the minimap? Oh, right there.

967
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:42,159
Clean. On to the next room.

968
01:30:42,159 --> 01:30:44,159
Beetle update? I have not gotten them yet.

969
01:30:44,159 --> 01:30:52,520
I do want to get them. That's probably

970
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:55,600
a summer thing. I don't

971
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:58,720
think death feigning

972
01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:01,600
blue death feigning beetles, I believe.

973
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:05,979
That's more soon

974
01:31:05,979 --> 01:31:23,199
than it is the cold months. You think you'd still be

975
01:31:23,199 --> 01:31:25,199
the house flipper guy if you weren't

976
01:31:25,199 --> 01:31:28,590
me? Well, I don't know. I

977
01:31:28,590 --> 01:31:32,350
wouldn't be me. So, I don't know.

978
01:31:32,350 --> 01:31:46,430
Probably not. Have you seen the new Zelda trailer?

979
01:31:46,430 --> 01:31:48,430
No, I'm not allowed to see the new Zelda

980
01:31:48,430 --> 01:32:10,319
trailer until I finish my homework. Yeah, I need to finish

981
01:32:10,319 --> 01:32:15,689
Breath of the Wild. There might be spoilers in there.

982
01:32:15,689 --> 01:32:22,670
Alright, have we done all the interior rooms besides

983
01:32:22,670 --> 01:32:34,960
the hallway? On the bottom floor at least.

984
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:38,989
You are never gonna finish Breath of

985
01:32:38,989 --> 01:32:45,630
the Wild. How can you be so sure? I gotta pick up

986
01:32:45,630 --> 01:32:47,630
individual playing cards.

987
01:32:47,630 --> 01:33:02,010
Ugh. Take out the flame? You can't use a

988
01:33:02,010 --> 01:33:14,619
flamethrower. Oh, wait, you can. Well,

989
01:33:14,619 --> 01:33:29,720
I feel like the guy in the neighborhood that is going

990
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:34,079
way too far on Halloween. No, no.

991
01:33:34,079 --> 01:33:36,079
You don't understand. Every window has to

992
01:33:36,079 --> 01:33:38,079
have demon fire come out of it.

993
01:33:38,079 --> 01:33:49,149
Every ten minutes. It's gotta

994
01:33:49,149 --> 01:33:55,609
be on a fifteen minute timer. Well,

995
01:33:55,609 --> 01:34:02,840
that was much easier. I kinda feel

996
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:06,619
bad that I can... I feel like this is

997
01:34:06,619 --> 01:34:11,720
cheating. I'm cheating right now. This is

998
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:38,270
cheating. Where is this spot? How

999
01:34:38,270 --> 01:34:49,979
have I not cleaned it yet? Where is it? I have

1000
01:34:49,979 --> 01:34:54,720
no idea where this is. It's apparently in here.

1001
01:34:54,720 --> 01:35:22,079
I don't think it's outside. Where is it?

1002
01:35:22,079 --> 01:35:24,079
It's a mug on the floor.

1003
01:35:24,079 --> 01:35:33,479
I think that's plumbing. Yeah, that's just plumbing

1004
01:35:33,479 --> 01:35:37,319
for the toilet. But I don't know if this is gonna be the bathroom

1005
01:35:37,319 --> 01:35:42,829
so I don't know. Maybe it's not. Maybe it's

1006
01:35:42,829 --> 01:35:56,960
over here. Really? Upstairs?

1007
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:17,050
Where do you hide your weed stash?

1008
01:36:17,050 --> 01:36:22,409
Um, well, if you're

1009
01:36:22,409 --> 01:36:24,409
over twenty-one, marijuana is

1010
01:36:24,409 --> 01:36:28,000
illegal in Las Vegas. I mean,

1011
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:43,609
hide it. Aren't you nineteen?

1012
01:36:43,609 --> 01:37:21,039
Get out of here. I'm gonna gas.

1013
01:37:21,039 --> 01:37:43,930
Alright, let's start taking some walls down.

1014
01:37:43,930 --> 01:37:53,069
Fix the fuse box. Fixed.

1015
01:37:53,069 --> 01:37:55,069
I have points to put in. What am I doing? Alright.

1016
01:37:55,069 --> 01:38:00,430
Faster. Let's do that.

1017
01:38:00,430 --> 01:38:03,760
More demolition. More strength.

1018
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:05,760
And job requirements. Sound pretty good.

1019
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:26,479
Ooh! Look!

1020
01:38:26,479 --> 01:38:41,369
It's going to start. Cleanup's going pretty

1021
01:38:41,369 --> 01:38:47,840
well. There's one issue there.

1022
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:53,149
This is clean. This is clean.

1023
01:38:53,149 --> 01:39:06,140
Yeah, I got the Stardew Valley soundtrack playing in the

1024
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:16,489
background to make it extra comfortable.

1025
01:39:16,489 --> 01:39:21,529
I think this is permanent. Yeah, it is.

1026
01:39:21,529 --> 01:39:23,529
Who puked up that high on the wall?

1027
01:39:23,529 --> 01:39:28,079
You have to stand up here

1028
01:39:28,079 --> 01:39:30,319
and aim this way to

1029
01:39:30,319 --> 01:39:43,050
puke up at the ceiling. We're going to get all new bathroom

1030
01:39:43,050 --> 01:39:46,119
stuff anyways. Yeah, we're

1031
01:39:46,119 --> 01:40:06,270
going to do that. Remove the whole

1032
01:40:06,270 --> 01:40:09,279
bathroom? I might once everything's clean.

1033
01:40:09,279 --> 01:40:12,090
Design does not happen until everything is

1034
01:40:12,090 --> 01:40:18,109
clean. So all the HGTV

1035
01:40:18,109 --> 01:40:20,109
Andes can hold on

1036
01:40:20,109 --> 01:40:50,359
a second. There's dirt up here. Okay,

1037
01:40:50,359 --> 01:40:58,479
this is kind of cool. Where is it?

1038
01:40:58,479 --> 01:41:14,409
I got it. Okay, thank goodness.

1039
01:41:14,409 --> 01:41:44,619
Where? Okay, it's the

1040
01:41:44,619 --> 01:42:04,970
painting frames. One more? Where

1041
01:42:04,970 --> 01:42:20,010
is it? Yes, thank goodness. All right,

1042
01:42:20,010 --> 01:42:34,350
we're good. Yeah, the grappling hook was added

1043
01:42:34,350 --> 01:42:43,500
three days ago. Changing this.

1044
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:49,880
I might just remove this and we'll put something

1045
01:42:49,880 --> 01:42:56,539
else in. Yeah, I want a different staircase than that.

1046
01:42:56,539 --> 01:43:32,560
Okay, we build our

1047
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:51,100
own rooms. Hey, my birthday

1048
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:53,100
is 420. Can you get faded

1049
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:55,100
and play back rooms on Roblox?

1050
01:43:55,100 --> 01:44:02,760
Uh, I don't

1051
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:17,920
think so. There we go.

1052
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:26,300
Much better. I might even take this wall down

1053
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:31,210
too and just have a bathroom.

1054
01:44:31,210 --> 01:44:46,489
We'll see. You promised.

1055
01:44:46,489 --> 01:45:03,579
I didn't promise a 420 stream. No,

1056
01:45:03,579 --> 01:45:05,579
on 420, I'm going to be sitting

1057
01:45:05,579 --> 01:45:08,460
on my own couch watching old

1058
01:45:08,460 --> 01:45:11,720
Fraggle Rock episodes. I'm

1059
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:19,149
going to be very busy. I'm going to be incredibly

1060
01:45:19,149 --> 01:45:29,199
busy. You're going to do that without us?

1061
01:45:29,199 --> 01:45:40,649
All right, stairs.

1062
01:45:40,649 --> 01:45:50,239
I want it so bad right now.

1063
01:45:50,239 --> 01:45:52,239
We need a way to go up and down.

1064
01:45:52,239 --> 01:45:59,640
Hmm. How are animals

1065
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:05,899
going to use this? They're just not

1066
01:46:05,899 --> 01:46:08,590
on pivoting. The bottom floor is where

1067
01:46:08,590 --> 01:46:10,590
the animals live and the top floor is where

1068
01:46:10,590 --> 01:46:25,119
I live. And it's just going to be made out of gold

1069
01:46:25,119 --> 01:46:39,760
ladder. Yeah, I want there to be as much

1070
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:41,760
real estate as possible to put other stuff.

1071
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:46,750
Stairwell takes actually a very

1072
01:46:46,750 --> 01:47:04,729
large amount of space. That's the worst

1073
01:47:04,729 --> 01:47:07,359
possible place. Wait, where's the front door?

1074
01:47:07,359 --> 01:47:09,359
Where's the door? How do I get out of here?

1075
01:47:09,359 --> 01:47:13,819
How do I get out of this house?

1076
01:47:13,819 --> 01:47:15,819
Oh, okay. Uh-uh. I don't like this.

1077
01:47:15,819 --> 01:47:19,279
No, front door is right here. Yeah,

1078
01:47:19,279 --> 01:47:52,989
front door is right here. There. Because the bottom

1079
01:47:52,989 --> 01:48:13,659
floor is going to be the barn. Yeah, the upstairs

1080
01:48:13,659 --> 01:48:16,090
is going to be where I live. But there's going

1081
01:48:16,090 --> 01:48:19,550
to be, I'm sorry, but dad gets

1082
01:48:19,550 --> 01:48:21,850
to have one room down here. And I'll make,

1083
01:48:21,850 --> 01:48:27,680
I'll section it off right now. Garage?

1084
01:48:27,680 --> 01:48:34,140
I think that's fair. I had a dad room

1085
01:48:34,140 --> 01:48:49,560
before though. This needs to go over here.

1086
01:48:49,560 --> 01:49:15,869
This is, I'm claiming this is mine.

1087
01:49:15,869 --> 01:49:23,149
Either this one or this one. I like this one.

1088
01:49:23,149 --> 01:49:44,319
Get the color, right? Yeah.

1089
01:49:52,250 --> 01:49:55,130
I have no idea how to fucking swim.

1090
01:49:55,130 --> 01:50:05,420
I probably should remove this. I can

1091
01:50:05,420 --> 01:50:17,239
stand in here.

1092
01:50:17,239 --> 01:50:19,239
I'm happy. I don't even need to play the game anymore. I'm done.

1093
01:50:19,239 --> 01:50:22,319
This room is going to be immaculate.

1094
01:50:22,319 --> 01:50:24,680
Just wait. Check this out.

1095
01:50:24,680 --> 01:50:27,760
I'm going to get pool lights all over

1096
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:42,460
here. Hmm. All right.

1097
01:50:42,460 --> 01:50:44,460
What should I, I want like lighting, like

1098
01:50:44,460 --> 01:50:51,630
really nice lighting. What do you think?

1099
01:50:51,630 --> 01:50:58,479
Tile? That nice kind of

1100
01:50:58,479 --> 01:51:11,789
clean tile look on the walls? Of course.

1101
01:51:11,789 --> 01:51:15,180
Oh yeah, of course. Roulette table?

1102
01:51:15,180 --> 01:51:19,960
Okay. Oh yeah, this is perfect. I'll put

1103
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:25,149
that somewhere else in a minute. Wait,

1104
01:51:25,149 --> 01:51:33,210
I gotta make a casino? All right. This is

1105
01:51:33,210 --> 01:51:42,810
going to be a farm and a casino at the same time.

1106
01:51:42,810 --> 01:51:45,760
That's so stupid. All right. Don't

1107
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:50,109
get distracted. So bathroom.

1108
01:51:50,109 --> 01:52:08,350
What should it be? What should the colors be?

1109
01:52:08,350 --> 01:52:14,279
Just like a light blue? Green?

1110
01:52:14,279 --> 01:52:34,939
These are pretty default, but they look

1111
01:52:34,939 --> 01:52:40,170
good. Marble? Marble sounds good.

1112
01:52:40,170 --> 01:52:42,409
This looks kind of good. Wait a minute.

1113
01:52:42,409 --> 01:52:55,710
Look at this. Let me see what it looks like. That's

1114
01:52:55,710 --> 01:53:33,000
pretty sharp. What about the floor?

1115
01:53:33,000 --> 01:54:04,539
That's a good floor. Make the floor?

1116
01:54:04,539 --> 01:54:06,539
That's a great comment. Bro, you just

1117
01:54:06,539 --> 01:54:12,619
made a baptism room.

1118
01:54:12,619 --> 01:54:15,739
No. This is

1119
01:54:15,739 --> 01:54:29,310
my personal sanctuary.

1120
01:54:29,310 --> 01:54:31,310
It's a barn, a church,

1121
01:54:31,310 --> 01:54:36,239
and a casino. Oh man.

1122
01:54:36,239 --> 01:54:42,430
I don't think

1123
01:54:42,430 --> 01:54:44,430
I don't think you can get permits to have a casino

1124
01:54:44,430 --> 01:54:47,949
and a church in the same space.

1125
01:54:47,949 --> 01:54:49,949
I don't think that's how it works.

1126
01:54:49,949 --> 01:54:54,489
I think there'd be quite a few people that would have things to say about that.

1127
01:54:54,489 --> 01:54:57,560
I would imagine.

1128
01:54:57,560 --> 01:55:07,470
Baptism chamber.

1129
01:55:07,470 --> 01:55:09,470
Everyone's saying fix the tub.

1130
01:55:09,470 --> 01:55:16,000
Hold on. I can't.

1131
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,920
I think it's like this permanently. Unless I sell

1132
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:30,510
it. Well, that's definitely the walls for sure.

1133
01:55:30,510 --> 01:55:41,630
I actually really like it. The outlet?

1134
01:55:41,630 --> 01:55:48,409
Yeah, this is a little

1135
01:55:48,409 --> 01:55:50,649
fucked up, but it's all right. Everything's going to be fine.

1136
01:55:50,649 --> 01:56:13,159
Nice. This is a saw death trap.

1137
01:56:13,159 --> 01:56:18,010
It's not done. If

1138
01:56:18,010 --> 01:56:20,010
you were constructing a house and somebody walked over and saw

1139
01:56:20,010 --> 01:56:22,510
the frame and went,

1140
01:56:22,510 --> 01:56:24,510
Hey, are you making a saw death trap?

1141
01:56:24,510 --> 01:56:28,350
The house is not done.

1142
01:56:28,350 --> 01:56:36,409
How are the sunflowers doing? Good

1143
01:56:36,409 --> 01:56:41,449
question. Ooh, pretty nicely

1144
01:56:41,449 --> 01:56:57,119
it seems. Pumpkins are not done.

1145
01:56:57,119 --> 01:56:59,609
I just got a bunch of corn. Oh.

1146
01:56:59,609 --> 01:57:03,710
I wonder, do I feed this to animals?

1147
01:57:03,710 --> 01:57:11,310
I would imagine. Plus six corn.

1148
01:57:11,310 --> 01:57:22,939
That's kind of cool.

1149
01:57:22,939 --> 01:57:25,630
Animals provide 50% more produce.

1150
01:57:25,630 --> 01:57:27,630
50% increased growth rate of crops.

1151
01:57:27,630 --> 01:57:37,420
Which one of these is better? Probably this one.

1152
01:57:37,420 --> 01:57:40,170
No, I probably won't do it.

1153
01:57:40,170 --> 01:57:44,569
Oh, it's done. Pumpkin?

1154
01:57:44,569 --> 01:57:53,279
Maybe animals provide more produce?

1155
01:57:53,279 --> 01:57:59,470
Whoa. I'm

1156
01:57:59,470 --> 01:58:06,829
harvesting all the sunflowers. I probably

1157
01:58:06,829 --> 01:58:23,979
make animal food. Seems pretty good.

1158
01:58:23,979 --> 01:58:35,479
All right. Back to what we were doing. It'd be so

1159
01:58:35,479 --> 01:58:43,420
funny if you could play. We gotta get a better door than

1160
01:58:43,420 --> 01:58:50,270
this. This thing sucks. All right.

1161
01:58:50,270 --> 01:58:52,699
I'm walking in. I want misters.

1162
01:58:52,699 --> 01:58:56,140
I want kind of scented

1163
01:58:56,140 --> 01:58:58,319
misters to be spraying

1164
01:58:58,319 --> 01:59:00,489
at an angle here and here.

1165
01:59:00,489 --> 01:59:04,510
Right at the door. I want to get coated

1166
01:59:04,510 --> 01:59:06,750
by like a nice gentle mist.

1167
01:59:06,750 --> 01:59:14,220
Some kind of fragrance.

1168
01:59:14,220 --> 01:59:16,399
Then I want to be able to sit down here and just

1169
01:59:16,399 --> 01:59:31,229
sit, inhale and exhale.

1170
01:59:31,229 --> 01:59:43,840
Let me do this. Carbon monoxide.

1171
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:52,800
And by the way, I don't

1172
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:56,569
want a window in here. This is for

1173
01:59:56,569 --> 01:59:59,199
me to come in, sit down

1174
01:59:59,199 --> 02:00:05,260
with some nice lights.

1175
02:00:05,260 --> 02:00:07,260
You're gonna get CO2?

1176
02:00:07,260 --> 02:00:09,260
I'm gonna be, what? I'll put a vent.

1177
02:00:09,260 --> 02:00:36,250
See?

1178
02:00:36,250 --> 02:00:40,479
That's not enough.

1179
02:00:40,479 --> 02:00:42,479
See? I'll be fine. I've got a vent.

1180
02:00:42,479 --> 02:00:52,720
It's not an interrogation room.

1181
02:00:52,720 --> 02:00:57,640
What interrogation room has

1182
02:00:57,640 --> 02:01:00,010
marbled blue

1183
02:01:00,010 --> 02:01:02,010
like pool walls?

1184
02:01:02,010 --> 02:01:05,279
What are you talking about?

1185
02:01:05,279 --> 02:01:07,279
I've never seen an interrogation room

1186
02:01:07,279 --> 02:01:09,279
on any television shows or any movie

1187
02:01:09,279 --> 02:01:11,279
that took place inside of an indoor

1188
02:01:11,279 --> 02:01:19,920
pool facility. All right. Move this.

1189
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:32,829
Gotta get my towel in the right spot. See?

1190
02:01:32,829 --> 02:01:38,460
We're safe. I don't hate that

1191
02:01:38,460 --> 02:01:53,159
light. There. Are you happy?

1192
02:01:53,159 --> 02:02:09,979
There. Are you happy now?

1193
02:02:09,979 --> 02:02:11,979
No. I am not making

1194
02:02:11,979 --> 02:02:13,979
the SpongeBob kitchen.

1195
02:02:13,979 --> 02:02:16,600
It might look identical

1196
02:02:16,600 --> 02:02:18,600
right now, but I can assure

1197
02:02:18,600 --> 02:02:20,600
you this is not the SpongeBob kitchen.

1198
02:02:20,600 --> 02:02:22,600
But now I feel like it kind of has to be.

1199
02:02:22,600 --> 02:02:29,710
But what about my sanctuary?

1200
02:02:29,710 --> 02:02:35,720
But what about my

1201
02:02:35,720 --> 02:02:54,350
sanctuary? Oh my

1202
02:02:54,350 --> 02:02:56,350
god. Damn it.

1203
02:02:56,350 --> 02:02:59,420
Okay. Fine. Fine.

1204
02:02:59,420 --> 02:03:01,420
I'm making a second room where my

1205
02:03:01,420 --> 02:03:09,039
sanctuary is going. There's like two barrels.

1206
02:03:09,039 --> 02:03:19,979
Where's the door? So the door

1207
02:03:19,979 --> 02:03:22,800
needs to be here, right?

1208
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:24,800
So let's say the window is here.

1209
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:35,279
So the door would need to be here. That's

1210
02:03:35,279 --> 02:03:37,710
fine. Let's operate on the door being right

1211
02:03:37,710 --> 02:03:52,619
here. So the door is there. The fridge.

1212
02:03:52,619 --> 02:03:56,569
Where's the wall? No, the

1213
02:03:56,569 --> 02:03:58,569
door would need to be right here, but I can't do it like

1214
02:03:58,569 --> 02:04:05,159
that. Because if this was the window,

1215
02:04:05,159 --> 02:04:09,579
I guess that would make sense.

1216
02:04:09,579 --> 02:04:13,159
Then I need a little table right here.

1217
02:04:13,159 --> 02:04:25,640
It's blue, right? Everything,

1218
02:04:25,640 --> 02:04:27,640
almost everything in this room is blue. Does this

1219
02:04:27,640 --> 02:04:43,949
work? It's white. Put on

1220
02:04:43,949 --> 02:05:03,470
SpongeBob music? Okay, the oven is

1221
02:05:03,470 --> 02:05:05,470
blue. It's like a flat top.

1222
02:05:05,470 --> 02:05:12,810
I wonder if they have them in this game. Oh,

1223
02:05:12,810 --> 02:05:15,880
no. I can make this blue

1224
02:05:15,880 --> 02:05:20,680
though. I think this is close enough.

1225
02:05:20,680 --> 02:05:31,239
Is it a flat top or is it a

1226
02:05:31,239 --> 02:05:38,159
stove, right? Would it be like oven?

1227
02:05:38,159 --> 02:05:41,739
Like grill? Yeah, all they have are these.

1228
02:05:41,739 --> 02:05:46,199
This might do it.

1229
02:05:46,199 --> 02:05:51,579
Not quite. I think

1230
02:05:51,579 --> 02:05:57,720
it's honestly this one. Or one of the ovens.

1231
02:05:57,720 --> 02:06:04,699
I mean, it's this.

1232
02:06:04,699 --> 02:06:06,699
It just needs to be. Okay, we can't make it blue.

1233
02:06:06,699 --> 02:06:10,090
This is perfect. Top is like

1234
02:06:10,090 --> 02:06:15,279
a dark blue. How do I

1235
02:06:15,279 --> 02:06:17,579
do the top? Okay. Top

1236
02:06:17,579 --> 02:06:25,449
is like that. And then it's kind

1237
02:06:25,449 --> 02:06:36,380
of gray. Not that gray. I

1238
02:06:36,380 --> 02:06:48,350
think it's good like this. So where's the fridge?

1239
02:06:48,350 --> 02:06:50,520
Alright, now we need the hole here.

1240
02:06:50,520 --> 02:07:05,689
It's just kind of an open square.

1241
02:07:05,689 --> 02:07:07,689
Oh my god. They actually have

1242
02:07:07,689 --> 02:07:30,720
it. Not enough space on the wall.

1243
02:07:30,720 --> 02:07:33,470
Oh, it has to be exterior.

1244
02:07:33,470 --> 02:07:45,819
Shit. They might all have to be exterior.

1245
02:07:45,819 --> 02:07:52,279
Might be able to get away with it with something else.

1246
02:07:52,279 --> 02:07:57,850
Hold on. I don't know, like opening

1247
02:07:57,850 --> 02:08:01,050
or... It might be something weird.

1248
02:08:01,050 --> 02:08:03,979
Walls. Now it would be

1249
02:08:03,979 --> 02:08:16,640
glass walls?

1250
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:26,560
Damn it. It has to be exterior. Yeah,

1251
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:32,569
it's got to be exterior.

1252
02:08:32,569 --> 02:08:37,180
We might be out of luck here.

1253
02:08:37,180 --> 02:08:53,039
Half wall is okay. Just

1254
02:08:53,039 --> 02:08:59,439
do a drive-through episode.

1255
02:08:59,439 --> 02:09:01,439
As long as we don't touch anything, that

1256
02:09:01,439 --> 02:09:13,279
is accurate. So I need

1257
02:09:13,279 --> 02:09:15,279
to put a... Hold on, let me fix this.

1258
02:09:15,279 --> 02:09:22,760
Do half walls. Yeah.

1259
02:09:22,760 --> 02:09:31,920
Squidward would hate this.

1260
02:09:31,920 --> 02:10:00,569
Yes, he would.

1261
02:10:11,640 --> 02:10:14,520
What kind of... It's like a submarine

1262
02:10:14,520 --> 02:10:24,760
door, right? I'll put on SpongeBob

1263
02:10:24,760 --> 02:10:27,069
music. That sounds fun. SpongeBob

1264
02:10:27,069 --> 02:10:34,279
OST. An hour

1265
02:10:34,279 --> 02:10:47,149
of relaxing SpongeBob music.

1266
02:10:47,149 --> 02:10:59,739
Sounds perfect. Alright, the door

1267
02:10:59,739 --> 02:11:01,739
is... It's an open doorway,

1268
02:11:01,739 --> 02:11:07,229
right? Does it close? It's kind of like

1269
02:11:07,229 --> 02:11:29,560
a big arch.

1270
02:11:29,560 --> 02:11:32,189
I mean, if that was a little

1271
02:11:32,189 --> 02:11:34,430
lower tech, it would be perfect.

1272
02:11:34,430 --> 02:11:50,090
This one looks good. Turn the music up.

1273
02:11:50,090 --> 02:12:06,010
There you go. Do the vault door?

1274
02:12:06,010 --> 02:12:14,119
That might be something better. Hold on.

1275
02:12:14,119 --> 02:12:26,220
That actually might be the closest thing.

1276
02:12:26,220 --> 02:12:29,420
Yeah, whatever. Sounds good.

1277
02:12:29,420 --> 02:12:49,949
Maybe we can stick with the blue. Ah, Squidward!

1278
02:12:49,949 --> 02:13:03,260
So where's the fridge?

1279
02:13:03,260 --> 02:13:29,039
We're gonna fix this. Okay,

1280
02:13:29,039 --> 02:13:50,729
I can't hear anything. My building is

1281
02:13:50,729 --> 02:13:58,600
so slow. Your SpongeBob

1282
02:13:58,600 --> 02:14:00,600
impression sounds like Squidward trying

1283
02:14:00,600 --> 02:14:07,640
to do a SpongeBob impression. Thanks

1284
02:14:07,640 --> 02:14:11,039
for the compliment. Alright, we're gonna retile.

1285
02:14:11,039 --> 02:14:14,560
The floor is already done, but it needs to

1286
02:14:14,560 --> 02:14:28,439
be a little bit lighter wood. I like that bubble

1287
02:14:28,439 --> 02:14:36,060
sound. It looks like this one

1288
02:14:36,060 --> 02:15:06,319
here. Other way. Okay.

1289
02:15:06,319 --> 02:15:10,090
Thank God he's making

1290
02:15:10,090 --> 02:15:13,609
the crusty crab. Well, this is just

1291
02:15:13,609 --> 02:15:29,869
one room of the house.

1292
02:15:29,869 --> 02:15:32,560
What were the tiles they called?

1293
02:15:32,560 --> 02:15:42,090
Where were they?

1294
02:15:42,090 --> 02:15:54,760
There. Beautiful.

1295
02:15:54,760 --> 02:16:14,460
This stream is a vibe right now. Yeah.

1296
02:16:14,460 --> 02:16:18,859
I'm glad. I'm just

1297
02:16:18,859 --> 02:16:22,380
chilling out.

1298
02:16:22,380 --> 02:16:30,510
I feel pretty good. Alright.

1299
02:16:30,510 --> 02:16:32,510
So I need my sanctuary row.

1300
02:16:32,510 --> 02:16:34,510
I can't even say that word. Sanctuary.

1301
02:16:34,510 --> 02:16:39,370
Sanctuary.

1302
02:16:39,370 --> 02:16:41,370
Kind of ugly, but I can't fix it.

1303
02:16:41,370 --> 02:16:51,739
Alright. Can I get another picture

1304
02:16:51,739 --> 02:17:02,110
of the room? So the fridge.

1305
02:17:02,110 --> 02:17:07,799
Okay, so there's a door.

1306
02:17:07,799 --> 02:17:13,879
Alright, so if that's where the door is.

1307
02:17:13,879 --> 02:17:15,879
There's another door

1308
02:17:15,879 --> 02:17:17,879
here. Are there two doors?

1309
02:17:17,879 --> 02:17:20,700
There's a gas. There's another range

1310
02:17:20,700 --> 02:17:22,700
right here. There's another gas stove.

1311
02:17:22,700 --> 02:17:34,600
This one is beige.

1312
02:17:34,600 --> 02:17:48,219
It's like beige.

1313
02:17:48,219 --> 02:17:54,750
It's a little too bright.

1314
02:17:54,750 --> 02:18:10,430
So there's the window.

1315
02:18:10,430 --> 02:18:12,430
Okay, the fridge is right here.

1316
02:18:12,430 --> 02:18:15,180
It's one of those double door fridges.

1317
02:18:15,180 --> 02:18:21,389
And it's all blue.

1318
02:18:21,389 --> 02:18:28,170
It's kind of like this.

1319
02:18:28,170 --> 02:18:38,139
What? Two of these. Is it wider?

1320
02:18:38,139 --> 02:18:48,639
I can't make this blue.

1321
02:18:48,639 --> 02:19:14,200
Here we go. Kind of purple.

1322
02:19:14,200 --> 02:19:23,209
Okay.

1323
02:19:23,209 --> 02:19:25,209
And there's a bunch of, there's like a condiments table.

1324
02:19:25,209 --> 02:19:28,989
It almost, it looks like a little

1325
02:19:28,989 --> 02:19:30,989
wardrobe. Like a little bureau.

1326
02:19:30,989 --> 02:19:46,139
Whoa, this is way better.

1327
02:19:46,139 --> 02:20:14,879
This is a thousand times better. The fridge.

1328
02:20:14,879 --> 02:20:22,040
Okay. I need a low,

1329
02:20:22,040 --> 02:20:24,409
like one of these. This might be fine.

1330
02:20:24,409 --> 02:20:33,290
It's probably a lower one. Pretty good.

1331
02:20:33,290 --> 02:20:54,989
I'd like it to be wider.

1332
02:20:54,989 --> 02:21:08,920
Almost there.

1333
02:21:08,920 --> 02:21:10,920
It was lower. It needed to be lower, lower, lower.

1334
02:21:10,920 --> 02:21:14,809
I think that's fine.

1335
02:21:14,809 --> 02:21:22,489
This works. Can't make it blue though.

1336
02:21:22,489 --> 02:21:39,709
And there's condiments all over this.

1337
02:21:39,709 --> 02:21:53,579
Ooh.

1338
02:21:53,579 --> 02:22:27,680
What was that thing?

1339
02:22:27,680 --> 02:22:53,600
You can actually do a koi pond.

1340
02:22:53,600 --> 02:22:56,219
It was a thing that was hanging on the wall.

1341
02:22:56,219 --> 02:23:00,379
And it looks just like this image here.

1342
02:23:00,379 --> 02:23:02,379
It was a bunch of utensils and tools.

1343
02:23:02,379 --> 02:23:04,379
And they just look just like this thing.

1344
02:23:04,379 --> 02:23:08,479
I can't find it.

1345
02:23:08,479 --> 02:23:17,610
Here it is. Where?

1346
02:23:17,610 --> 02:23:20,110
Oh, yep. Here it is. Okay, cool.

1347
02:23:20,110 --> 02:23:22,110
This doesn't match, but it looks good enough.

1348
02:23:22,110 --> 02:23:48,840
Good enough.

1349
02:23:48,840 --> 02:23:50,840
It's kind of coming together. What's in this corner?

1350
02:23:50,840 --> 02:23:56,729
These are all horse tools.

1351
02:23:56,729 --> 02:23:59,930
Yeah, but it looks fine.

1352
02:23:59,930 --> 02:24:04,860
You need the door to Mr.

1353
02:24:04,860 --> 02:24:12,729
Crab's office.

1354
02:24:12,729 --> 02:24:17,020
So this is going to have to be Mr. Crab's office.

1355
02:24:17,020 --> 02:24:22,270
No, I'm not making the whole

1356
02:24:22,270 --> 02:24:24,639
Krusty Krab.

1357
02:24:24,639 --> 02:24:26,639
I'm not making the entire...

1358
02:24:26,639 --> 02:24:28,639
What about my farm church casino?

1359
02:24:28,639 --> 02:24:35,739
I have to make the whole

1360
02:24:35,739 --> 02:24:41,950
Krusty Krab restaurant?

1361
02:24:41,950 --> 02:24:48,219
It would take me two weeks to do that.

1362
02:24:48,219 --> 02:24:50,219
What about my pool?

1363
02:24:50,219 --> 02:25:01,020
Alright, so let me...

1364
02:25:01,020 --> 02:25:03,260
Okay, okay, okay. So this is to the kitchen.

1365
02:25:03,260 --> 02:25:07,209
The other door

1366
02:25:07,209 --> 02:25:09,709
is here.

1367
02:25:09,709 --> 02:25:11,709
It's not though. It's different in every

1368
02:25:11,709 --> 02:25:14,399
episode. I feel like the doors

1369
02:25:14,399 --> 02:25:16,399
in this room are different in every

1370
02:25:16,399 --> 02:25:30,670
other season. Alright, I'll make the whole

1371
02:25:30,670 --> 02:25:34,700
Krusty Krab. Fine. Fine.

1372
02:25:34,700 --> 02:25:36,879
You don't think I will?

1373
02:25:36,879 --> 02:25:38,879
You don't think I'll make the whole entire Krusty Krab?

1374
02:25:38,879 --> 02:25:41,180
Down to the last...

1375
02:25:41,180 --> 02:25:43,360
Down to the last...

1376
02:25:43,360 --> 02:25:45,360
Touch. Down to the last...

1377
02:25:45,360 --> 02:25:47,360
Like buffing out the last scratch.

1378
02:25:47,360 --> 02:26:10,319
No, I'm not doing that.

1379
02:26:10,319 --> 02:26:13,770
Let me at least finish this room. Why is it so

1380
02:26:13,770 --> 02:26:21,129
loud? Okay.

1381
02:26:21,129 --> 02:26:23,309
Door here.

1382
02:26:23,309 --> 02:26:25,739
Door over here.

1383
02:26:25,739 --> 02:26:28,620
So this stuff is actually a little bit more

1384
02:26:28,620 --> 02:26:31,629
to the right. Is the door

1385
02:26:31,629 --> 02:26:34,120
here? Where does this door go?

1386
02:26:34,120 --> 02:26:44,299
So this is Mr. Crab's office

1387
02:26:44,299 --> 02:26:52,430
over here. Is he enough?

1388
02:26:52,430 --> 02:27:05,100
How big is Mr. Crab's office?

1389
02:27:05,100 --> 02:27:19,690
It's pretty small, right?

1390
02:27:19,690 --> 02:27:24,799
Isn't it just a desk?

1391
02:27:24,799 --> 02:27:35,360
There's a desk right there. It kind of is

1392
02:27:35,360 --> 02:27:39,579
this size. Turn the light on.

1393
02:27:39,579 --> 02:27:46,600
Okay. This is a

1394
02:27:46,600 --> 02:27:48,600
load-bearing wall so I can't get rid of it.

1395
02:27:48,600 --> 02:28:00,889
Here's a Krusty Krab map

1396
02:28:00,889 --> 02:28:07,159
you can look at. No, I can't play

1397
02:28:07,159 --> 02:28:10,110
that. I'm just going to look up

1398
02:28:10,110 --> 02:28:12,110
Krusty Krab office.

1399
02:28:12,110 --> 02:28:19,719
Oh, this is a good... Okay, here we go.

1400
02:28:19,719 --> 02:28:37,629
I can do this. So it really

1401
02:28:37,629 --> 02:28:39,629
is just a big desk.

1402
02:28:39,629 --> 02:28:41,629
It's kind of like a big... Is it like a treasure chest?

1403
02:28:41,629 --> 02:28:48,799
Like a suitcase? I think like a

1404
02:28:48,799 --> 02:28:50,799
toy chest will work.

1405
02:28:50,799 --> 02:29:01,020
A toy box. What about just like a box?

1406
02:29:01,020 --> 02:29:13,739
Huh? This dude's 40?

1407
02:29:13,739 --> 02:29:30,750
Not yet. Trunk?

1408
02:29:30,750 --> 02:29:43,709
Oh. Hmm.

1409
02:29:43,709 --> 02:29:50,040
Chest. I'm surprised I don't have one.

1410
02:29:50,040 --> 02:30:04,110
Turn this up. SpongeBob is only

1411
02:30:04,110 --> 02:30:06,479
four adults. I want some water.

1412
02:30:06,479 --> 02:30:19,069
I'll come back and we'll continue.

1413
02:30:19,069 --> 02:33:27,100
I'll be right back. See?

1414
02:33:27,100 --> 02:33:32,030
I'm back. Christmas music?

1415
02:33:32,030 --> 02:33:39,389
Yeah, you should probably change the title to

1416
02:33:39,389 --> 02:33:41,389
Making the Krusty... Yeah, somebody said it. Making the Krusty Krab

1417
02:33:41,389 --> 02:33:43,389
because chat pressured me to do it.

1418
02:33:43,389 --> 02:33:49,530
And then... And then dash?

1419
02:33:49,530 --> 02:33:53,479
I want out. Yeah, there's got to be like

1420
02:33:53,479 --> 02:34:03,790
a dash. I want out.

1421
02:34:03,790 --> 02:34:18,639
Alright, let's go. Well, let me get the stuff that I know.

1422
02:34:18,639 --> 02:34:21,260
I don't think I'll be able to find the exact

1423
02:34:21,260 --> 02:34:23,260
thing, but a wardrobe should

1424
02:34:23,260 --> 02:34:28,379
do it. One of the short,

1425
02:34:28,379 --> 02:34:32,780
wide... They definitely have it.

1426
02:34:32,780 --> 02:34:39,420
Really? It might just

1427
02:34:39,420 --> 02:34:41,420
have to be this big wooden box.

1428
02:34:41,420 --> 02:35:01,049
Okay.

1429
02:35:01,049 --> 02:35:03,049
Now, it's like a big throne, isn't it?

1430
02:35:03,049 --> 02:35:06,639
It's a very large

1431
02:35:06,639 --> 02:35:08,639
chair. Where is it? They definitely have a

1432
02:35:08,639 --> 02:35:18,299
version of it. That's pretty good.

1433
02:35:18,299 --> 02:35:39,290
Oh, and make sure you stay to the end of the stream

1434
02:35:39,290 --> 02:35:41,600
because I'm going to do a full

1435
02:35:41,600 --> 02:35:44,159
all-in SpongeBob SquarePants

1436
02:35:44,159 --> 02:35:46,780
laugh. You're not going to want to miss it.

1437
02:35:46,780 --> 02:36:06,780
Stay tuned. Yeah, that one's fine.

1438
02:36:06,780 --> 02:36:17,399
Gold, right? You can't see it.

1439
02:36:17,399 --> 02:36:19,639
Well, it's going to have to

1440
02:36:19,639 --> 02:36:26,110
do for now. These other two chairs are going to

1441
02:36:26,110 --> 02:36:36,799
have to be these. I saw them earlier. They're

1442
02:36:36,799 --> 02:36:40,190
kind of thicker here.

1443
02:36:40,190 --> 02:36:42,559
Because they're kind of hollowed out

1444
02:36:42,559 --> 02:36:48,959
barrels. I wish I could just go back.

1445
02:36:48,959 --> 02:36:51,959
Can I just go back? I'm missing that button or something.

1446
02:36:51,959 --> 02:37:17,100
There's no window.

1447
02:37:17,100 --> 02:37:20,489
There's another door? Where's the other door go?

1448
02:37:20,489 --> 02:37:32,010
It's wood on the walls.

1449
02:37:32,010 --> 02:37:40,889
We've got to get the aesthetic right.

1450
02:37:40,889 --> 02:37:42,889
Are they horizontal or vertical lines? Looks like they're

1451
02:37:42,889 --> 02:38:04,639
vertical. Kind of like this.

1452
02:38:04,639 --> 02:38:12,489
Yeah, I like that. The lines are vertical.

1453
02:38:12,489 --> 02:38:18,250
I'm looking at a reference image right now.

1454
02:38:18,250 --> 02:38:25,719
Wrong way. Fake fan.

1455
02:38:25,719 --> 02:38:27,719
Oh, this is the door

1456
02:38:27,719 --> 02:38:30,280
that we're seeing here.

1457
02:38:30,280 --> 02:38:32,280
Which means this has to be turned this way.

1458
02:38:32,280 --> 02:38:34,520
Alright, I'll do that in a second. What does that even mean?

1459
02:38:34,520 --> 02:38:50,590
So that back wall is metal.

1460
02:38:50,590 --> 02:39:08,489
Such a fake fan.

1461
02:39:08,489 --> 02:39:10,489
No, I'm sorry guys. I don't remember the

1462
02:39:10,489 --> 02:39:12,729
blueprints of the Krusty

1463
02:39:12,729 --> 02:39:28,479
Krab. Literally L.

1464
02:39:28,479 --> 02:39:30,479
What? Why? I don't know the

1465
02:39:30,479 --> 02:39:33,040
blueprints of the Krusty Krab.

1466
02:39:33,040 --> 02:39:39,479
Now I need a metal.

1467
02:39:39,479 --> 02:39:54,120
Like a steel. Okay.

1468
02:39:54,120 --> 02:39:57,500
Close. You are killing

1469
02:39:57,500 --> 02:39:59,500
my childhood right now. It's not even close.

1470
02:39:59,500 --> 02:40:12,280
I've seen a few things that

1471
02:40:12,280 --> 02:40:35,879
could work.

1472
02:40:35,879 --> 02:40:37,879
I'll try the one I was going to do. It's this one

1473
02:40:37,879 --> 02:40:43,959
down here. Oh shit, it's a double.

1474
02:40:43,959 --> 02:40:58,809
Shit, this is a double too. I don't want a double.

1475
02:40:58,809 --> 02:41:09,629
I need to see what it looks like.

1476
02:41:09,629 --> 02:41:11,629
This is not my final decision here.

1477
02:41:11,629 --> 02:41:59,040
That's better, right? I think that's

1478
02:41:59,040 --> 02:42:05,370
accurate. So this is Mr. Krab's office.

1479
02:42:05,370 --> 02:42:07,370
We can go and mess around with this

1480
02:42:07,370 --> 02:42:15,159
later. Very important.

1481
02:42:15,159 --> 02:42:17,790
How the hell does this

1482
02:42:17,790 --> 02:42:20,520
work?

1483
02:42:20,520 --> 02:42:24,430
Because this comes out to the restaurant.

1484
02:42:24,430 --> 02:42:27,180
And then Squidward's

1485
02:42:27,180 --> 02:42:29,180
station is right here.

1486
02:42:29,180 --> 02:42:35,690
And it's a big boat. I doubt we'll be able

1487
02:42:35,690 --> 02:42:40,489
to do that though.

1488
02:42:40,489 --> 02:42:46,190
It looks like a boat.

1489
02:42:46,190 --> 02:42:48,879
Can you do a Squidward laugh?

1490
02:42:48,879 --> 02:43:05,260
Why are there so many weapons?

1491
02:43:05,260 --> 02:43:12,680
Wait a minute.

1492
02:43:12,680 --> 02:43:44,520
Yeah.

1493
02:43:44,520 --> 02:43:47,149
How am I going to make Squidward's

1494
02:43:47,149 --> 02:43:54,639
cashier station?

1495
02:43:54,639 --> 02:43:57,639
It's a boat. How am I going to make a boat?

1496
02:43:57,639 --> 02:44:02,319
It's going to be some type of

1497
02:44:02,319 --> 02:44:05,200
furniture. Wait, what about a big pet bed?

1498
02:44:05,200 --> 02:44:09,719
That might work.

1499
02:44:09,719 --> 02:44:32,379
Sort of boat-like.

1500
02:44:32,379 --> 02:44:36,989
The race car bed could work.

1501
02:44:36,989 --> 02:44:42,360
Wait a minute. This is pretty damn

1502
02:44:42,360 --> 02:44:51,200
close. I wish I could change the color.

1503
02:44:51,200 --> 02:45:00,350
I wish I could make it bigger. Oh, I could do a bathtub.

1504
02:45:00,350 --> 02:45:08,219
Yeah, that's true. What color is it?

1505
02:45:08,219 --> 02:45:21,149
I need a fixture

1506
02:45:21,149 --> 02:45:24,540
first. Alright, let me get the back wall.

1507
02:45:24,540 --> 02:45:27,159
The back wall is kind of like a blue

1508
02:45:27,159 --> 02:45:29,899
and green and pink

1509
02:45:29,899 --> 02:45:31,899
and it's kind of a lot of different colors, but I don't think

1510
02:45:31,899 --> 02:45:34,200
I can do it. So we're going to have to just do

1511
02:45:34,200 --> 02:45:36,200
the best I can here. Just make it

1512
02:45:36,200 --> 02:45:41,450
kind of industrial. I could

1513
02:45:41,450 --> 02:45:46,059
paint it. Oh, it's a boat.

1514
02:45:46,059 --> 02:46:02,879
I think the bathtub will be fine.

1515
02:46:02,879 --> 02:46:08,959
Should we just use the ones we were using before?

1516
02:46:08,959 --> 02:46:16,829
These kind of work. I think this is actually

1517
02:46:16,829 --> 02:46:20,479
perfect. Alright, let's spend like

1518
02:46:20,479 --> 02:46:22,479
a hundred thousand dollars on this

1519
02:46:22,479 --> 02:46:24,479
because it's going to be almost the entire floor here.

1520
02:46:24,479 --> 02:46:29,920
Alright, before we do anything,

1521
02:46:29,920 --> 02:46:33,370
this is all open.

1522
02:46:33,370 --> 02:46:37,149
And there's a bunch of tables.

1523
02:46:37,149 --> 02:46:43,100
What happened to the farm animals?

1524
02:46:43,100 --> 02:46:45,979
I got bullied into

1525
02:46:45,979 --> 02:46:47,979
making Krusty Krab.

1526
02:46:47,979 --> 02:47:00,010
No, I wanted to make it.

1527
02:47:00,010 --> 02:47:10,760
I'm kidding. That's the nature

1528
02:47:10,760 --> 02:47:13,450
of House Flipper. You go in with a

1529
02:47:13,450 --> 02:47:15,450
design and then you do

1530
02:47:15,450 --> 02:47:17,450
something completely different and you don't

1531
02:47:17,450 --> 02:47:19,450
even start on the thing that you wanted to do.

1532
02:47:19,450 --> 02:47:26,040
I might get halfway

1533
02:47:26,040 --> 02:47:28,040
through the Krusty Krab and this might turn into a different

1534
02:47:28,040 --> 02:47:40,909
place. Alright, so this

1535
02:47:40,909 --> 02:47:51,319
is...

1536
02:47:51,319 --> 02:47:54,840
I'm thinking about pulling this whole

1537
02:47:54,840 --> 02:48:02,520
wall forward, having it be across

1538
02:48:02,520 --> 02:48:20,000
this way. Yeah, the whole thing has to come forward

1539
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:29,340
because that will give a lot more room for the

1540
02:48:29,340 --> 02:48:31,639
other... Yeah, this place

1541
02:48:31,639 --> 02:48:55,840
can really breathe. Can you upgrade

1542
02:48:55,840 --> 02:48:57,840
swing speed? I can upgrade

1543
02:48:57,840 --> 02:48:59,840
the hammer, which I'll do that now.

1544
02:48:59,840 --> 02:49:09,159
So the hammer's better. Yeah, that's much better.

1545
02:49:09,159 --> 02:49:15,049
Can we get a plankton voice?

1546
02:49:15,049 --> 02:49:17,049
You want me to do plankton?

1547
02:49:17,049 --> 02:49:19,049
SpongeBob?

1548
02:49:19,049 --> 02:49:21,049
I don't know if...

1549
02:49:21,049 --> 02:49:23,049
That was a little deeper maybe.

1550
02:49:23,049 --> 02:49:44,040
Don't crash my

1551
02:49:44,040 --> 02:49:46,280
stream's joke economy right now.

1552
02:49:46,280 --> 02:49:48,459
That wasn't that bad?

1553
02:49:48,459 --> 02:50:08,879
Why was that that bad?

1554
02:50:08,879 --> 02:50:10,879
That was Mitch McConnell's voice?

1555
02:50:15,610 --> 02:50:17,610
SpongeBob?

1556
02:50:17,610 --> 02:50:29,500
You're right. Yep, that's true.

1557
02:50:29,500 --> 02:50:37,049
Pull this forward. I don't need to get into there

1558
02:50:37,049 --> 02:50:40,379
from here. No, I don't. I'll seal it up later.

1559
02:50:40,379 --> 02:51:00,479
You went from 2100

1560
02:51:00,479 --> 02:51:03,159
to 1790 with that one. That's

1561
02:51:03,159 --> 02:51:05,530
not fair. That's not fair.

1562
02:51:05,530 --> 02:51:12,110
That's not fair.

1563
02:51:12,110 --> 02:51:45,629
Why can't I move this? Alright,

1564
02:51:45,629 --> 02:51:47,629
so the door to get in is

1565
02:51:47,629 --> 02:51:51,450
here. No, where

1566
02:51:51,450 --> 02:51:57,790
is it? It's right here. Right there.

1567
02:51:57,790 --> 02:52:26,120
One more.

1568
02:52:26,120 --> 02:52:29,450
Your stock just went down. That's

1569
02:52:29,450 --> 02:52:38,159
fine. Hey, I pay out

1570
02:52:38,159 --> 02:52:53,959
comedy dividends. That means every

1571
02:52:53,959 --> 02:52:55,959
every few months I read you out

1572
02:52:55,959 --> 02:52:58,459
my draft tweets and there are always

1573
02:52:58,459 --> 02:53:02,489
bangers.

1574
02:53:02,489 --> 02:53:24,379
You find me a draft tweet that you didn't like

1575
02:53:24,379 --> 02:53:26,680
and I will

1576
02:53:26,680 --> 02:53:28,680
agree or disagree with you.

1577
02:53:28,680 --> 02:53:44,879
It's really that big? Why is this

1578
02:53:44,879 --> 02:53:50,959
so huge? This is

1579
02:53:50,959 --> 02:54:10,989
massive. Am I

1580
02:54:10,989 --> 02:54:13,549
crazy or something? Why is this still

1581
02:54:13,549 --> 02:54:15,549
not big enough?

1582
02:54:15,549 --> 02:54:23,680
Come on, dude. Really?

1583
02:54:23,680 --> 02:54:49,280
Which is better? This or Papa's freezer

1584
02:54:49,280 --> 02:54:51,959
ria? This is much better. I love

1585
02:54:51,959 --> 02:54:53,959
Papa's freezer ria

1586
02:54:53,959 --> 02:54:56,639
but how slippery is it in my top

1587
02:54:56,639 --> 02:55:10,270
25 games of all time?

1588
02:55:10,270 --> 02:55:13,920
Alright, do a little bit

1589
02:55:13,920 --> 02:55:19,549
more cleaning up. I need a wall.

1590
02:55:19,549 --> 02:55:21,549
Oh, damn it.

1591
02:55:21,549 --> 02:55:23,549
What is it? What is it?

1592
02:55:23,549 --> 02:55:26,680
What is this? What is going on here?

1593
02:55:26,680 --> 02:55:33,639
What is this? What the hell is this?

1594
02:55:33,639 --> 02:55:58,540
What is this weird paneling

1595
02:55:58,540 --> 02:56:13,319
behind this? Okay.

1596
02:56:13,319 --> 02:56:15,819
I can stay there for now.

1597
02:56:15,819 --> 02:56:22,670
Still, okay, that's much better.

1598
02:56:22,670 --> 02:56:26,700
I might want to move this over a little bit.

1599
02:56:26,700 --> 02:56:34,120
It's not quite all the way flush.

1600
02:56:34,120 --> 02:56:37,440
Say my leg. My leg.

1601
02:56:37,440 --> 02:56:57,209
My leg. Ow.

1602
02:56:57,209 --> 02:57:18,120
Did I get the part?

1603
02:57:18,120 --> 02:57:20,120
Now I can bring this wall forward.

1604
02:57:20,120 --> 02:57:31,120
I'd love to pick this up. I can't pick it up

1605
02:57:31,120 --> 02:57:34,889
anymore. That's a problem for like

1606
02:57:34,889 --> 02:57:37,260
this problem next weekend.

1607
02:57:37,260 --> 02:57:59,020
I want, yeah, speed for sure.

1608
02:57:59,020 --> 02:58:09,950
Alright, I just keep making adjustments.

1609
02:58:09,950 --> 02:58:28,360
Okay.

1610
02:58:28,360 --> 02:58:38,920
Go like this. Much better.

1611
02:58:38,920 --> 02:58:46,840
Okay, let's just get

1612
02:58:46,840 --> 02:58:51,129
this over with. Front door of the

1613
02:58:51,129 --> 02:58:55,159
Krusty Krab is

1614
02:58:55,159 --> 02:58:57,159
right in, it's right here.

1615
02:58:57,159 --> 02:59:01,629
Right in the front. The whole

1616
02:59:01,629 --> 02:59:29,020
floor is green.

1617
02:59:29,020 --> 02:59:31,020
I'm not going to read that. You're fucking

1618
02:59:31,020 --> 02:59:34,670
crazy. Why did you write that?

1619
02:59:34,670 --> 02:59:40,040
All the things to write down

1620
02:59:40,040 --> 02:59:42,040
into a chat room and press enter.

1621
02:59:42,040 --> 02:59:58,620
It's just an immediate response.

1622
02:59:58,620 --> 03:00:01,370
Immediate response. You didn't

1623
03:00:01,370 --> 03:00:04,250
even take one second.

1624
03:00:04,250 --> 03:00:06,250
It was like, oh, yeah.

1625
03:00:06,250 --> 03:00:08,250
The floor of the Krusty Krab is green.

1626
03:00:08,250 --> 03:00:11,129
I look over three seconds, not even, you didn't even take

1627
03:00:11,129 --> 03:00:13,690
not even two seconds.

1628
03:00:13,690 --> 03:00:17,920
My shit is green sometimes.

1629
03:00:17,920 --> 03:00:21,440
Alright. Really?

1630
03:00:21,440 --> 03:00:23,440
Okay. Not even a

1631
03:00:23,440 --> 03:00:27,979
second.

1632
03:00:27,979 --> 03:00:29,979
Why would you share that with the glass?

1633
03:00:29,979 --> 03:00:51,739
Does the Krusty Krab have a bathroom?

1634
03:00:51,739 --> 03:01:01,790
Alright, well this has to be sealed off.

1635
03:01:01,790 --> 03:01:03,790
Because I want people to come through

1636
03:01:03,790 --> 03:01:05,790
this, which is the front door.

1637
03:01:05,790 --> 03:01:08,409
This is all glass,

1638
03:01:08,409 --> 03:01:10,409
isn't it? Big glass panels.

1639
03:01:10,409 --> 03:01:12,780
Can I get a

1640
03:01:12,780 --> 03:01:14,780
exterior of the Krusty Krab, please?

1641
03:01:14,780 --> 03:01:33,399
Would it be under door?

1642
03:01:33,399 --> 03:01:46,969
Or like glass, right?

1643
03:01:46,969 --> 03:01:56,239
Do it again. Okay.

1644
03:01:56,239 --> 03:01:59,180
Same thing on the other side. Two big

1645
03:01:59,180 --> 03:02:14,030
glass doors to get in. It might have to be

1646
03:02:14,030 --> 03:02:48,200
these side by side. Why is this so fucked up?

1647
03:02:48,200 --> 03:03:23,280
Is there a double door?

1648
03:03:23,280 --> 03:03:25,280
It has to be at the last double door.

1649
03:03:25,280 --> 03:03:35,180
Oh, right here. That's

1650
03:03:35,180 --> 03:03:38,379
much better. Oh, it's way too big

1651
03:03:38,379 --> 03:03:45,159
though. It's way too big.

1652
03:03:45,159 --> 03:04:00,510
This could work. Jesus.

1653
03:04:00,510 --> 03:04:13,309
Something like this is on the other side over here.

1654
03:04:13,309 --> 03:04:30,959
This is what's over here. Shit.

1655
03:04:30,959 --> 03:04:44,590
The entire front is glass. I don't think

1656
03:04:44,590 --> 03:05:04,620
I can do that though. It's a place

1657
03:05:04,620 --> 03:05:17,850
holder for now. That's gotta be glass.

1658
03:05:17,850 --> 03:05:31,290
That's gotta be glass. Okay. I'm gonna sneeze.

1659
03:05:31,290 --> 03:05:52,909
I actually caught it this time.

1660
03:05:52,909 --> 03:05:57,840
Okay. Now the

1661
03:05:57,840 --> 03:05:59,840
foundation is almost here. Now the work will speed

1662
03:05:59,840 --> 03:06:01,840
up very, very much intensely.

1663
03:06:01,840 --> 03:06:24,280
Here we go. This is a vibe

1664
03:06:24,280 --> 03:06:28,829
tonight. I'm glad. That makes me happy.

1665
03:06:28,829 --> 03:06:41,120
This will start to look more and more like

1666
03:06:41,120 --> 03:06:43,120
your beloved Krusty Krab

1667
03:06:43,120 --> 03:06:51,930
very shortly. This is

1668
03:06:51,930 --> 03:06:55,450
a good street to fall asleep to. Yeah, that's

1669
03:06:55,450 --> 03:06:59,739
cool. I don't mind that.

1670
03:06:59,739 --> 03:07:19,559
Big problem. I

1671
03:07:19,559 --> 03:07:22,250
cannot put anything

1672
03:07:22,250 --> 03:07:24,250
on the top or bottom here.

1673
03:07:24,250 --> 03:07:26,250
This has to be blocked with the bathtub.

1674
03:07:26,250 --> 03:07:29,520
This is actually a pretty major

1675
03:07:29,520 --> 03:07:39,120
problem. Can I do the half wall on

1676
03:07:39,120 --> 03:07:46,350
the ground? I don't know if I

1677
03:07:46,350 --> 03:07:48,840
can do a half wall on the ground.

1678
03:07:48,840 --> 03:08:01,559
I cannot. A window theoretically

1679
03:08:01,559 --> 03:08:03,559
is a great idea, but I

1680
03:08:03,559 --> 03:08:05,559
don't know if there are very many windows that

1681
03:08:05,559 --> 03:08:07,739
can be interior windows.

1682
03:08:07,739 --> 03:08:17,340
I need a fixture though.

1683
03:08:17,340 --> 03:08:30,780
Mountable bathtub. Where's the actual

1684
03:08:30,780 --> 03:08:33,979
bathtub?

1685
03:08:33,979 --> 03:08:45,420
This one here, right? I need the actual

1686
03:08:45,420 --> 03:08:47,420
thing. Where do you buy those?

1687
03:08:47,420 --> 03:08:53,229
Baths and showers.

1688
03:08:53,229 --> 03:08:58,350
Where is it? It's the

1689
03:08:58,350 --> 03:09:00,350
little thing that has to go into the wall.

1690
03:09:00,350 --> 03:09:20,559
Call something else

1691
03:09:20,559 --> 03:09:26,700
installations instead of this.

1692
03:09:26,700 --> 03:09:31,950
Okay, here we go. Yeah. Shower.

1693
03:09:31,950 --> 03:09:36,680
All right. Bathtub. But it's on the wall.

1694
03:09:36,680 --> 03:09:41,479
I need a wall.

1695
03:09:41,479 --> 03:09:51,899
This could hide it. I wonder how well

1696
03:09:51,899 --> 03:10:14,860
this hides it. Let's find out. I think this might

1697
03:10:14,860 --> 03:10:16,860
hide it. Yeah, this one will hide it much better.

1698
03:10:16,860 --> 03:10:46,920
I wonder what the biggest one is. Installation.

1699
03:10:46,920 --> 03:10:49,290
Oh. Where's just like

1700
03:10:49,290 --> 03:10:51,290
bathtub? Bathroom.

1701
03:10:51,290 --> 03:10:54,170
Okay, fixtures. Oh, I wish they would

1702
03:10:54,170 --> 03:10:56,170
I wish I could see how big they were without

1703
03:10:56,170 --> 03:11:16,399
having to buy it first. That's

1704
03:11:16,399 --> 03:11:19,020
pretty good. I don't know

1705
03:11:19,020 --> 03:11:31,239
if I'm going to do better than that. Maybe

1706
03:11:31,239 --> 03:11:33,870
I could. I doubt it though.

1707
03:11:33,870 --> 03:12:04,000
Wait a minute. Guys.

1708
03:12:04,000 --> 03:12:08,540
Guys, I could have just

1709
03:12:08,540 --> 03:12:10,540
made my own fucking

1710
03:12:10,540 --> 03:12:17,000
building. Why have I

1711
03:12:17,000 --> 03:12:19,000
decided to turn this

1712
03:12:19,000 --> 03:12:21,000
residential house

1713
03:12:21,000 --> 03:12:23,440
into the Krusty Krab? I could have just made the

1714
03:12:23,440 --> 03:12:25,440
Krusty Krab from scratch.

1715
03:12:25,440 --> 03:12:28,120
Well, now it's too late.

1716
03:12:28,120 --> 03:12:31,260
But are there any empty

1717
03:12:31,260 --> 03:12:33,260
lots? I didn't see an empty lot.

1718
03:12:33,260 --> 03:12:49,579
I'm going to see this through.

1719
03:12:49,579 --> 03:12:53,100
I think this is going to be good. Trust in

1720
03:12:53,100 --> 03:12:55,100
this process I have here.

1721
03:12:55,100 --> 03:13:01,309
Trust in this process.

1722
03:13:01,309 --> 03:13:35,530
The price is broken. Portal 3?

1723
03:13:35,530 --> 03:13:38,159
Hold

1724
03:13:38,159 --> 03:13:42,760
on. Just wait till the tables get in here.

1725
03:13:42,760 --> 03:13:47,120
Wait till the floor is done.

1726
03:13:47,120 --> 03:13:49,120
Wait till the decorations are up.

1727
03:13:49,120 --> 03:14:09,719
How long has this been playing for? I thought

1728
03:14:09,719 --> 03:14:22,639
this was still Spongebob.

1729
03:14:22,639 --> 03:14:29,479
Leave this on.

1730
03:14:29,479 --> 03:14:31,479
This was pretty good.

1731
03:14:31,479 --> 03:14:54,000
This is nice. We're making progress.

1732
03:14:54,000 --> 03:15:26,239
Here we go. One, when

1733
03:15:26,239 --> 03:15:28,799
the floor is installed, you're

1734
03:15:28,799 --> 03:15:31,930
all going to be...oh my

1735
03:15:31,930 --> 03:15:37,479
god. That's the

1736
03:15:37,479 --> 03:15:42,600
Krusty Krab. Now that's

1737
03:15:42,600 --> 03:16:04,620
the Krusty Krab I know.

1738
03:16:04,620 --> 03:16:06,620
Me doing that accent is like

1739
03:16:06,620 --> 03:16:12,059
Cilantro for a lot of you. You either really liked

1740
03:16:12,059 --> 03:16:14,059
what I just did or you hated it so

1741
03:16:14,059 --> 03:16:16,059
much that you just, you just

1742
03:16:16,059 --> 03:16:38,510
want me to turn my stream off. Alright.

1743
03:16:38,510 --> 03:16:47,079
Floor going in. It is a green

1744
03:16:47,079 --> 03:16:54,620
floor. This looks pretty good.

1745
03:16:54,620 --> 03:17:04,799
Let's try it.

1746
03:17:04,799 --> 03:17:28,729
I need lights in here. It's a green wood.

1747
03:17:28,729 --> 03:17:38,510
I don't know if I can do that. Green

1748
03:17:38,510 --> 03:17:43,500
wood. I don't think so.

1749
03:17:43,500 --> 03:17:46,360
This is close. Tile though.

1750
03:17:46,360 --> 03:18:01,690
Alright. Better. I think that's

1751
03:18:01,690 --> 03:18:06,040
better. It's got some more texture on it.

1752
03:18:06,040 --> 03:18:15,579
Can you change the color of the wood? You can, but you can

1753
03:18:15,579 --> 03:18:17,579
only really change it to other wood

1754
03:18:17,579 --> 03:18:24,090
likes. You can't make it like purple

1755
03:18:24,090 --> 03:18:46,879
or green or...so does this

1756
03:18:46,879 --> 03:18:49,309
door go anywhere in the Krusty Krab?

1757
03:18:49,309 --> 03:18:53,790
No. This is the Krusty Krab right

1758
03:18:53,790 --> 03:18:55,790
here. I'm making my

1759
03:18:55,790 --> 03:19:00,829
sanctuary. No. That's my

1760
03:19:00,829 --> 03:19:06,780
room. Alright. Where are the lights in the Krusty Krab?

1761
03:19:06,780 --> 03:19:20,969
Do they hang from the ceiling?

1762
03:19:20,969 --> 03:19:26,219
Alright. Krusty Krab

1763
03:19:26,219 --> 03:19:35,239
restaurant floor. Yeah.

1764
03:19:35,239 --> 03:19:40,040
This is as close as it's going to be though.

1765
03:19:40,040 --> 03:19:45,799
What do we got for lights? It kind of looks like

1766
03:19:45,799 --> 03:19:55,399
I can't really tell. There's glass

1767
03:19:55,399 --> 03:19:58,969
back here though. I was going to have

1768
03:19:58,969 --> 03:20:09,079
ceiling lights. These are kind of

1769
03:20:09,079 --> 03:20:22,959
interesting. Nice untextured

1770
03:20:22,959 --> 03:20:24,959
source map.

1771
03:20:24,959 --> 03:20:35,629
It looks fine. Where should I even put these?

1772
03:20:35,629 --> 03:20:41,770
There are no lights in the Krusty Krab

1773
03:20:41,770 --> 03:20:46,000
guys. There are no lights.

1774
03:20:46,000 --> 03:21:04,600
Oh! It's a jump

1775
03:21:04,600 --> 03:21:13,739
map. It's not done. Yeah

1776
03:21:13,739 --> 03:21:15,739
it does look like a dev room doesn't it? Because I'm

1777
03:21:15,739 --> 03:21:17,920
currently developing it right

1778
03:21:17,920 --> 03:21:42,219
now. It's not done. I'll do that

1779
03:21:42,219 --> 03:22:04,489
later. Aren't the walls wood in the dining

1780
03:22:04,489 --> 03:22:08,969
area? I don't know.

1781
03:22:08,969 --> 03:22:12,559
No. The glass. There's

1782
03:22:12,559 --> 03:22:16,969
wooden trim down here.

1783
03:22:16,969 --> 03:22:18,969
This is all this metal.

1784
03:22:18,969 --> 03:22:22,280
And then it's glass?

1785
03:22:22,280 --> 03:22:28,809
Glass. So this is a bunch of glass

1786
03:22:28,809 --> 03:22:31,629
glass glass. Glass and wood.

1787
03:22:31,629 --> 03:22:46,799
Why are these lights so high up?

1788
03:22:46,799 --> 03:22:52,809
Okay. I need to do, fix this

1789
03:22:52,809 --> 03:22:54,809
wood here. Ground.

1790
03:22:54,809 --> 03:23:02,559
This one I believe right here.

1791
03:23:02,559 --> 03:23:20,329
It is. What is casting a shadow over

1792
03:23:20,329 --> 03:23:29,799
here?

1793
03:23:29,799 --> 03:23:42,030
This is supposed to be Mr. Krab's

1794
03:23:42,030 --> 03:23:57,709
office.

1795
03:23:57,709 --> 03:23:59,709
Does Mr. Krab have the green on his floor too?

1796
03:23:59,709 --> 03:24:18,200
I'm sorry.

1797
03:24:18,200 --> 03:24:21,920
This looks like

1798
03:24:21,920 --> 03:24:24,799
you know those game makers

1799
03:24:24,799 --> 03:24:26,799
that are on you know

1800
03:24:26,799 --> 03:24:28,799
you can just get it like oh download this

1801
03:24:28,799 --> 03:24:34,360
game making studio.

1802
03:24:34,360 --> 03:24:36,360
This is, you just downloaded

1803
03:24:36,360 --> 03:24:38,670
a game maker studio. But you just opened

1804
03:24:38,670 --> 03:24:41,799
up Unity for the first time. And this

1805
03:24:41,799 --> 03:24:43,799
is what you came up with for the first, and you have no

1806
03:24:43,799 --> 03:24:48,159
experience at all. Zero. And

1807
03:24:48,159 --> 03:24:51,100
and you're twelve.

1808
03:24:51,100 --> 03:25:01,920
Just like oh look at my room that I made.

1809
03:25:01,920 --> 03:25:04,479
Yeah. There's chairs.

1810
03:25:04,479 --> 03:25:08,809
And there's a chair. But hey.

1811
03:25:08,809 --> 03:25:12,590
You gotta start somewhere. And when you first

1812
03:25:12,590 --> 03:25:14,590
make this room and you get really into it

1813
03:25:14,590 --> 03:25:16,889
and you go wow that was actually really cool. That was really

1814
03:25:16,889 --> 03:25:20,989
fun. And you end up making something like this.

1815
03:25:20,989 --> 03:25:24,959
Which is a level up from that.

1816
03:25:24,959 --> 03:25:28,600
And then you end up making a room like this.

1817
03:25:28,600 --> 03:25:40,750
Which isn't done yet. L plus

1818
03:25:40,750 --> 03:25:46,000
ratio plus your twelve. I

1819
03:25:46,000 --> 03:25:48,000
think it looks pretty good. I'm going

1820
03:25:48,000 --> 03:26:07,129
on the fucking lawn.

1821
03:26:07,129 --> 03:26:11,930
You need to hold your applause

1822
03:26:11,930 --> 03:26:19,930
until the end of the stream. We're going to see

1823
03:26:19,930 --> 03:26:26,840
all the before and after pictures.

1824
03:26:26,840 --> 03:26:40,280
Oh nice rain. This has been

1825
03:26:40,280 --> 03:26:42,280
a disastrous one guy.

1826
03:26:42,280 --> 03:26:47,079
I don't think so. No.

1827
03:26:47,079 --> 03:26:52,329
It's not done yet.

1828
03:26:52,329 --> 03:26:54,329
I don't want you looking over my shoulder while I'm doing

1829
03:26:54,329 --> 03:26:58,040
game development. This is not

1830
03:26:58,040 --> 03:27:00,040
even in a technical alpha right now.

1831
03:27:00,040 --> 03:27:03,690
This is in a Unity free

1832
03:27:03,690 --> 03:27:05,690
trial mode right now. This is not

1833
03:27:05,690 --> 03:27:21,819
a technical alpha. So

1834
03:27:21,819 --> 03:27:23,819
I see tables and they look pretty

1835
03:27:23,819 --> 03:27:29,709
cool and I know exactly where I'm putting them.

1836
03:27:29,709 --> 03:27:31,709
They are they have yellow in the middle and red

1837
03:27:31,709 --> 03:27:33,709
on the outside and they are wheels.

1838
03:27:33,709 --> 03:27:36,329
They are boat steering

1839
03:27:36,329 --> 03:27:40,360
wheels. That's not awful.

1840
03:27:40,360 --> 03:27:56,540
Not awful.

1841
03:27:56,540 --> 03:28:01,719
I could say dining table couldn't I? This one's

1842
03:28:01,719 --> 03:28:08,190
pretty good. Look at a picture of the Krusty. I got

1843
03:28:08,190 --> 03:28:10,190
a picture of the Krusty Krab right here. I'm looking at it right

1844
03:28:10,190 --> 03:28:31,479
now. Tables. This place

1845
03:28:31,479 --> 03:28:33,479
looks nothing like the Krusty Krab period.

1846
03:28:33,479 --> 03:28:36,170
Fuck you. Hey

1847
03:28:36,170 --> 03:28:38,170
come on dude.

1848
03:28:38,170 --> 03:28:40,860
I'm trying. I'm trying.

1849
03:28:40,860 --> 03:28:45,079
Oh that's pretty good.

1850
03:28:45,079 --> 03:28:58,840
They have the one kind

1851
03:28:58,840 --> 03:29:01,079
of pole in the middle.

1852
03:29:01,079 --> 03:29:03,079
It's on a stand. I don't think there's

1853
03:29:03,079 --> 03:29:14,799
any of those here though. They're red

1854
03:29:14,799 --> 03:29:27,399
on the outside. Close enough?

1855
03:29:27,399 --> 03:29:34,680
Yeah it's close enough. And

1856
03:29:34,680 --> 03:29:37,629
there is one here. There's

1857
03:29:37,629 --> 03:29:40,959
one here. There's one here.

1858
03:29:40,959 --> 03:29:42,959
There's one here. There's one here.

1859
03:29:42,959 --> 03:29:59,920
And they sit on little

1860
03:29:59,920 --> 03:30:17,879
barrels. Is it too big? They have little

1861
03:30:17,879 --> 03:30:23,200
any mini barrels?

1862
03:30:23,200 --> 03:30:31,840
Maybe a stool will look like it.

1863
03:30:31,840 --> 03:30:34,590
Pretty good if I could make it beige. Pretty good.

1864
03:30:34,590 --> 03:31:01,389
Right here. There we go.

1865
03:31:01,389 --> 03:31:20,200
They all have two or three. I can move all these

1866
03:31:20,200 --> 03:31:34,600
later. Guys, contrary to popular

1867
03:31:34,600 --> 03:31:38,700
belief, the finishings

1868
03:31:38,700 --> 03:31:44,270
is what ties everything together.

1869
03:31:44,270 --> 03:31:46,270
It's all about

1870
03:31:46,270 --> 03:31:48,270
the decorations and the finishings.

1871
03:31:48,270 --> 03:31:51,129
Already right now

1872
03:31:51,129 --> 03:31:53,129
it has already started to look more like

1873
03:31:53,129 --> 03:31:55,440
the Krusty Krab. Just simply by adding

1874
03:31:55,440 --> 03:31:58,760
the tables. We're going to do a bunch of stuff

1875
03:31:58,760 --> 03:32:09,959
here to hide this. Where's

1876
03:32:09,959 --> 03:32:12,329
Mr. Krab's door? It's coming.

1877
03:32:12,329 --> 03:32:17,579
It's going to be over here. It's going to be right

1878
03:32:17,579 --> 03:32:19,579
here. And you don't...

1879
03:32:19,579 --> 03:32:21,579
I'll show you the finishing touches

1880
03:32:21,579 --> 03:32:34,190
in a second. Where are the bathrooms?

1881
03:32:34,190 --> 03:32:42,920
That's a good question. The bathrooms

1882
03:32:42,920 --> 03:32:46,569
are on the right side.

1883
03:32:46,569 --> 03:32:48,569
So the bathrooms

1884
03:32:48,569 --> 03:32:53,799
need to be over here.

1885
03:32:53,799 --> 03:33:14,219
Bathrooms are over here. How do I move this?

1886
03:33:14,219 --> 03:33:21,579
I cannot take down

1887
03:33:21,579 --> 03:33:23,579
these walls, so I'm just going to have to

1888
03:33:23,579 --> 03:33:27,229
improvise a little. We're going to extend this

1889
03:33:27,229 --> 03:33:34,969
a little bit further. The bathroom doesn't

1890
03:33:34,969 --> 03:33:36,969
exist. No, it's not going to work.

1891
03:33:36,969 --> 03:33:42,350
It might work if I do this.

1892
03:33:42,350 --> 03:33:52,829
Can I build

1893
03:33:52,829 --> 03:34:00,319
off of the house? I don't think

1894
03:34:00,319 --> 03:34:02,319
I can build off of the house that

1895
03:34:02,319 --> 03:34:09,680
exists already. Can I?

1896
03:34:09,680 --> 03:34:14,090
I can't. Wait, is that actually

1897
03:34:14,090 --> 03:34:18,059
doing that? Wait, I can

1898
03:34:18,059 --> 03:34:22,729
do that. Alright. That's a big deal. Hold on.

1899
03:34:22,729 --> 03:34:49,469
So, if

1900
03:34:49,469 --> 03:34:51,469
I extend this wall

1901
03:34:51,469 --> 03:34:54,670
out, then I can make the bathrooms

1902
03:34:54,670 --> 03:35:05,159
right here. So that wall here

1903
03:35:05,159 --> 03:35:07,159
has to come out and match the wall over on

1904
03:35:07,159 --> 03:35:17,920
the other side. So if I can extend this

1905
03:35:17,920 --> 03:35:27,260
wall, that would be great. Because

1906
03:35:27,260 --> 03:35:29,879
this is the back. Let's see.

1907
03:35:29,879 --> 03:35:52,719
Yes! Let me

1908
03:35:52,719 --> 03:36:23,950
get rid of all this shit here. I just needed some space.

1909
03:36:23,950 --> 03:36:27,639
Alright. And now

1910
03:36:27,639 --> 03:36:32,000
can I bring this wall out?

1911
03:36:32,000 --> 03:36:34,000
What is this weird, what is this wacky

1912
03:36:34,000 --> 03:37:18,600
wall right here? No!

1913
03:37:18,600 --> 03:37:20,600
I can't get rid of this exterior

1914
03:37:20,600 --> 03:37:28,030
wall. No!

1915
03:37:28,030 --> 03:37:33,709
I can't, really?

1916
03:37:33,709 --> 03:37:35,709
Oh, oh well. Well, this is

1917
03:37:35,709 --> 03:37:39,979
the bathroom. Okay.

1918
03:37:39,979 --> 03:37:44,329
I gotta clean it. Put a door there?

1919
03:37:44,329 --> 03:37:48,299
I don't know if it'll work, though.

1920
03:37:48,299 --> 03:38:07,180
Because this wall can't be manipulated.

1921
03:38:07,180 --> 03:38:09,610
Oh! Oh!

1922
03:38:09,610 --> 03:38:14,159
I actually can. Alright. Where is

1923
03:38:14,159 --> 03:38:16,159
it? It's like right here.

1924
03:38:16,159 --> 03:38:19,469
Hell yeah. Nice!

1925
03:38:19,469 --> 03:38:24,520
It's a little messed up because

1926
03:38:24,520 --> 03:38:29,129
it's alright, though. Bathroom.

1927
03:38:29,129 --> 03:38:32,520
Beautiful. Perfect. Okay.

1928
03:38:32,520 --> 03:38:35,469
Bathroom.

1929
03:38:35,469 --> 03:38:42,879
Get a few images. A bunch of

1930
03:38:42,879 --> 03:38:57,209
wooden stalls, isn't it? Krusty

1931
03:38:57,209 --> 03:39:07,709
Krab bathroom. Okay.

1932
03:39:07,709 --> 03:39:16,799
So it's still green. Honestly,

1933
03:39:16,799 --> 03:39:18,799
the farm update will probably make this a lot easier.

1934
03:39:18,799 --> 03:39:28,520
So it's the same green, same blue.

1935
03:39:28,520 --> 03:40:03,840
Which I didn't delete at all.

1936
03:40:03,840 --> 03:40:05,840
Somebody doing the

1937
03:40:05,840 --> 03:40:07,840
chimpanzee jumping thing.

1938
03:40:07,840 --> 03:40:18,840
SpongeBob music! It kind of looks like

1939
03:40:18,840 --> 03:40:20,840
you guys are dancing to this song.

1940
03:40:20,840 --> 03:40:22,840
So I don't even see the anger in the chimpanzee.

1941
03:40:22,840 --> 03:40:25,469
I just see, I see you guys

1942
03:40:25,469 --> 03:40:35,200
rocking out to this music.

1943
03:40:35,200 --> 03:41:01,049
It's lining up with the music. Okay.

1944
03:41:01,049 --> 03:41:21,149
You just came back after two hours, what'd you miss?

1945
03:41:21,149 --> 03:41:24,719
Um, well, I think

1946
03:41:24,719 --> 03:41:26,719
it was just about an hour or two ago that I decided to make

1947
03:41:26,719 --> 03:41:38,680
this a SpongeBob house. Alright.

1948
03:41:38,680 --> 03:41:42,590
Good, almost done. There aren't

1949
03:41:42,590 --> 03:41:44,590
any more rooms after this, so it's all detail.

1950
03:41:44,590 --> 03:42:01,229
Damn it, it's not enough. It's fine.

1951
03:42:01,229 --> 03:42:03,229
Okay, so now we need the green. The green is easy.

1952
03:42:03,229 --> 03:42:12,120
Was these ones, no?

1953
03:42:12,120 --> 03:42:14,120
It was the... this one looks kind of better.

1954
03:42:14,120 --> 03:42:16,940
Oh, this is wall.

1955
03:42:16,940 --> 03:42:40,540
Damn it. Wait a minute.

1956
03:42:40,540 --> 03:42:44,059
These are way better. Isn't that kind of way better?

1957
03:42:44,059 --> 03:43:00,190
Nice. That's actually

1958
03:43:00,190 --> 03:43:04,090
perfect, yeah. I

1959
03:43:04,090 --> 03:43:06,329
don't know, you shouldn't be able to bump into stuff

1960
03:43:06,329 --> 03:43:31,100
when you're doing this. It's going the wrong

1961
03:43:31,100 --> 03:43:38,969
direction. Shit, it's got to

1962
03:43:38,969 --> 03:43:41,280
go vertical. You're right, damn it.

1963
03:43:41,280 --> 03:44:08,600
There is a vertical one, isn't there? It's actually

1964
03:44:08,600 --> 03:44:36,379
kind of getting there. Why is there got to be grass

1965
03:44:36,379 --> 03:44:39,389
sticking out? Alright, stalls.

1966
03:44:39,389 --> 03:44:41,389
They are made out of wood.

1967
03:44:41,389 --> 03:44:43,389
There are three or four toilets.

1968
03:44:43,389 --> 03:44:49,600
They're mounted into the wall.

1969
03:44:49,600 --> 03:44:53,120
They're the little mounted toilet, and they have

1970
03:44:53,120 --> 03:45:06,680
a life preserver. It's pretty close, but

1971
03:45:06,680 --> 03:45:12,250
it doesn't have the life preserver. That's close enough.

1972
03:45:12,250 --> 03:45:26,250
We're good. Alright, so it's one,

1973
03:45:26,250 --> 03:45:28,250
two, three. So I need three of those

1974
03:45:28,250 --> 03:45:39,049
things. Suspended toilet.

1975
03:45:39,049 --> 03:45:47,799
Alright, so we'll go one, two,

1976
03:45:47,799 --> 03:46:43,659
three. Alright, now I need to make

1977
03:46:43,659 --> 03:46:47,870
wooden stalls.

1978
03:46:47,870 --> 03:46:51,129
Do they make them anyways?

1979
03:46:51,129 --> 03:46:53,129
They do not, but

1980
03:46:53,129 --> 03:46:55,950
the farming update

1981
03:46:55,950 --> 03:46:59,840
gave us the ability

1982
03:46:59,840 --> 03:47:01,840
to make opening

1983
03:47:01,840 --> 03:47:06,569
kind of stall-like doors.

1984
03:47:06,569 --> 03:47:13,870
Greenhouse wooden segment. Oh,

1985
03:47:13,870 --> 03:47:36,590
here we go. This can't be inside.

1986
03:47:36,590 --> 03:47:49,959
Can none of this be?

1987
03:47:49,959 --> 03:48:18,959
So what do I do? Wooden roof side

1988
03:48:18,959 --> 03:48:22,219
segment. Where would the

1989
03:48:22,219 --> 03:48:24,889
I have no idea where they would put them. Like the

1990
03:48:24,889 --> 03:48:29,239
horse stable thing. There we

1991
03:48:29,239 --> 03:49:01,290
go. Yep, this should do it.

1992
03:49:01,290 --> 03:49:04,940
Are you going to play House Flipper 2? Better believe it.

1993
03:49:04,940 --> 03:49:15,239
Let me make these better.

1994
03:49:15,239 --> 03:49:26,879
I can't move these. But they have

1995
03:49:26,879 --> 03:49:29,819
What is hanging? There's like a cloth

1996
03:49:29,819 --> 03:49:37,180
or something. Hold on. So it's the wooden

1997
03:49:37,180 --> 03:49:39,360
doors, and then

1998
03:49:39,360 --> 03:49:41,360
it's two pieces of cloth that hang

1999
03:49:41,360 --> 03:49:43,360
from side to side. So these

2000
03:49:43,360 --> 03:49:47,260
technically would be the doors. I could always

2001
03:49:47,260 --> 03:49:53,850
add more toilets here. What's better?

2002
03:49:53,850 --> 03:49:55,850
House Flipper or Buffalo Chicken Sub? Buffalo

2003
03:49:55,850 --> 03:50:01,420
Chicken Sub all day. I'm sorry. Buffalo

2004
03:50:01,420 --> 03:50:03,420
Chicken Sub takes the place. It's like number

2005
03:50:03,420 --> 03:50:05,420
it's like number six on my

2006
03:50:05,420 --> 03:50:07,420
most favorite games of all time.

2007
03:50:07,420 --> 03:50:12,159
We were talking about like you got like Diablo 2

2008
03:50:12,159 --> 03:50:14,159
Team Fortress 2

2009
03:50:14,159 --> 03:50:16,159
Neverhood

2010
03:50:16,159 --> 03:50:18,520
Buffalo Chicken Sub

2011
03:50:18,520 --> 03:50:20,520
with blue cheese on it

2012
03:50:20,520 --> 03:50:22,520
obviously. And then probably Resident Evil

2013
03:50:22,520 --> 03:50:24,520
4 is probably up there.

2014
03:50:24,520 --> 03:50:26,520
Vampire Survivors is probably there too.

2015
03:50:26,520 --> 03:50:42,760
I need more toilets. Installation.

2016
03:50:42,760 --> 03:51:17,120
Good. Nothing over

2017
03:51:17,120 --> 03:51:21,340
there. That's fine. Blue cheese is so good. Yeah.

2018
03:51:21,340 --> 03:51:23,520
If I could

2019
03:51:23,520 --> 03:51:25,520
not get weird looks, I would

2020
03:51:25,520 --> 03:51:27,520
put blue cheese on almost every single meal.

2021
03:51:27,520 --> 03:51:43,959
Look at how nice and

2022
03:51:43,959 --> 03:51:45,959
colorful. Oh, look. SpongeBob.

2023
03:51:45,959 --> 03:51:58,569
Wow. Why are you not

2024
03:51:58,569 --> 03:52:01,840
at Coachella? I don't think I could name

2025
03:52:01,840 --> 03:52:03,840
you one band that's currently playing

2026
03:52:03,840 --> 03:52:06,200
at Coachella right now. I just don't think I could.

2027
03:52:06,200 --> 03:52:16,239
Okay. I need

2028
03:52:16,239 --> 03:52:23,149
What are they? What do they got? Decorations.

2029
03:52:23,149 --> 03:52:29,290
I need some nautical stuff.

2030
03:52:29,290 --> 03:52:50,829
Hmm. Let's see. There's

2031
03:52:50,829 --> 03:52:52,829
a hand dryer. There's a nautical.

2032
03:52:52,829 --> 03:53:02,239
There's a barrel. Oh, no. I thought I planted

2033
03:53:02,239 --> 03:53:10,430
other stuff. The gorillas are at Coachella

2034
03:53:10,430 --> 03:53:19,000
right now? Are you serious? Oh, shit.

2035
03:53:19,000 --> 03:53:21,000
Okay. Krusty Krab. Let's focus on one room

2036
03:53:21,000 --> 03:53:26,250
at a time, please.

2037
03:53:26,250 --> 03:53:29,129
I just typed in Krusty Krab

2038
03:53:29,129 --> 03:53:33,360
Coachella. Krusty Krab

2039
03:53:33,360 --> 03:53:48,840
restaurant floor. I mean,

2040
03:53:48,840 --> 03:53:54,479
there's not much else in here. There's a menu

2041
03:53:54,479 --> 03:53:57,290
that's up here. There's the door over there.

2042
03:53:57,290 --> 03:54:00,430
Okay. There's the door to

2043
03:54:00,430 --> 03:54:02,430
Mr. Krab's office, which let me go in there.

2044
03:54:02,430 --> 03:54:22,270
I can't even look at this because it's such a placeholder.

2045
03:54:22,270 --> 03:54:52,090
I can't even look at it. How about Minecraft

2046
03:54:52,090 --> 03:55:03,799
Cherry Blossom Forest?

2047
03:55:03,799 --> 03:55:19,290
It needs to be a little bit wider. I gotta

2048
03:55:19,290 --> 03:55:21,290
type this door. What is this? It's called

2049
03:55:21,290 --> 03:55:23,290
like something. Sounds like a C, right?

2050
03:55:23,290 --> 03:55:27,899
So I don't have to scroll down the never-ending

2051
03:55:27,899 --> 03:55:31,479
where is it? What the hell is it called?

2052
03:55:31,479 --> 03:55:36,219
It's called KY.

2053
03:55:36,219 --> 03:56:02,909
Okay. I guess I can only do

2054
03:56:02,909 --> 03:56:20,120
singles. I need a painting.

2055
03:56:20,120 --> 03:56:28,059
Something that looks like a menu.

2056
03:56:28,059 --> 03:57:01,639
Could be a menu. Oh, I can also import

2057
03:57:01,639 --> 03:57:10,219
images. That's true. Okay. Krusty

2058
03:57:10,219 --> 03:57:14,059
Krab

2059
03:57:14,059 --> 03:57:27,680
signs? Krusty Krab

2060
03:57:27,680 --> 03:57:38,239
Krusty Krab menu sign. It's kind of hard

2061
03:57:38,239 --> 03:57:42,889
to get a clean image of this.

2062
03:57:42,889 --> 03:57:44,889
I can get the big thing that's

2063
03:57:44,889 --> 03:57:48,670
outside. We'll do that later.

2064
03:57:48,670 --> 03:57:52,559
We're not done with our

2065
03:57:52,559 --> 03:58:18,799
internals here. Ugly, ugly, ugly,

2066
03:58:18,799 --> 03:58:21,479
ugly. We need these

2067
03:58:21,479 --> 03:58:23,659
glass panels

2068
03:58:23,659 --> 03:58:42,600
all over here. It sits on there weird.

2069
03:58:42,600 --> 03:59:05,870
Okay. Not bad. Not

2070
03:59:05,870 --> 03:59:14,000
bad. I want to put another one here, but

2071
03:59:14,000 --> 03:59:19,559
I don't think I have enough room for it. What happened to the music?

2072
03:59:19,559 --> 03:59:27,739
Oh, I closed the window.

2073
03:59:27,739 --> 03:59:30,299
What should I put on? Terraria? Terraria?

2074
03:59:30,299 --> 03:59:33,049
Okay. We've done that before. We did a little bit of Startup Valley.

2075
03:59:33,049 --> 03:59:42,569
Morrowind? RuneScape?

2076
03:59:42,569 --> 03:59:49,040
Pizza Tower is a little too intense

2077
03:59:49,040 --> 03:59:57,549
right now. Morrowind sounds pretty good.

2078
03:59:57,549 --> 04:00:15,840
There it is.

2079
04:00:15,840 --> 04:00:17,840
The Elder Scrolls III Morrowind.

2080
04:00:28,540 --> 04:00:30,540
I'm kidding. I know everyone's going to freak out.

2081
04:00:30,540 --> 04:00:46,090
So this is just more of the restaurant,

2082
04:00:46,090 --> 04:00:48,090
but this is way too big.

2083
04:00:48,090 --> 04:00:50,090
This is the Krusty Krab. This is how

2084
04:00:50,090 --> 04:00:55,209
big it is. There's no way

2085
04:00:55,209 --> 04:00:58,090
that I...

2086
04:00:58,090 --> 04:01:01,479
Here's my plan.

2087
04:01:01,479 --> 04:01:03,479
I'm getting my fucking zone that I want.

2088
04:01:03,479 --> 04:01:06,750
I'm getting my zone.

2089
04:01:06,750 --> 04:01:32,719
It's going to be a secret entrance.

2090
04:01:32,719 --> 04:01:36,680
I'm making my sanctuary.

2091
04:01:36,680 --> 04:01:41,610
You can go to the Krusty Krab all you want.

2092
04:01:41,610 --> 04:01:46,540
Me. I'll be in this room.

2093
04:01:46,540 --> 04:02:20,360
Crack shed.

2094
04:02:20,360 --> 04:02:22,360
This is the room he goes into to escape us.

2095
04:02:22,360 --> 04:02:53,850
One more piece.

2096
04:02:53,850 --> 04:03:12,600
I want my tub.

2097
04:03:12,600 --> 04:03:31,280
Thank you. I want a different

2098
04:03:31,280 --> 04:03:47,979
trim. Yeah.

2099
04:03:47,979 --> 04:04:04,479
We need a wall.

2100
04:04:04,479 --> 04:04:15,600
Wall tile. I'm clean.

2101
04:04:15,600 --> 04:04:28,139
How about these? I need to see the whole

2102
04:04:28,139 --> 04:04:37,549
thing. It's too bright. Well, we can

2103
04:04:37,549 --> 04:04:42,219
change the lighting. A little too

2104
04:04:42,219 --> 04:04:51,049
much going on. A little too loud.

2105
04:04:51,049 --> 04:05:01,739
Yeah, it's a little too loud.

2106
04:05:01,739 --> 04:05:07,440
This might be pretty good.

2107
04:05:07,440 --> 04:05:18,700
Put it down.

2108
04:05:18,700 --> 04:05:32,440
Pick it up. That is smoky.

2109
04:05:32,440 --> 04:05:35,069
I like it. Look at how smoky

2110
04:05:35,069 --> 04:06:10,329
this is. Can't stand in the pool.

2111
04:06:10,329 --> 04:06:20,879
Nice.

2112
04:06:20,879 --> 04:06:23,760
Just wait till I get the ambient lighting

2113
04:06:23,760 --> 04:06:25,930
in here. You are going to shit your

2114
04:06:25,930 --> 04:07:02,280
pants. This room is kind of freaking me out.

2115
04:07:02,280 --> 04:07:04,280
I don't like it. It's like too much going on.

2116
04:07:04,280 --> 04:07:07,420
I need ambient lighting in here. Quick.

2117
04:07:07,420 --> 04:07:18,219
I need really cool

2118
04:07:18,219 --> 04:07:20,219
ambient lighting in here.

2119
04:07:20,219 --> 04:07:27,709
As soon as humanly possible.

2120
04:07:27,709 --> 04:07:46,700
Yeah. Yeah.

2121
04:07:46,700 --> 04:07:48,700
Dude, that's real subtle. I know.

2122
04:07:48,700 --> 04:07:54,010
I need, hold on. Star Wars?

2123
04:07:54,010 --> 04:08:18,969
I'm not comfortable in here

2124
04:08:18,969 --> 04:08:25,690
yet. This feels like

2125
04:08:25,690 --> 04:08:27,690
a fake

2126
04:08:27,690 --> 04:08:29,930
room for a prank show.

2127
04:08:29,930 --> 04:08:32,879
Oh, yes. Come right this way, Mr.

2128
04:08:32,879 --> 04:08:34,879
Hudson. Come over here. Come to our beautiful spa.

2129
04:08:34,879 --> 04:08:37,309
It's like, oh, okay.

2130
04:08:37,309 --> 04:08:41,020
Someone's going to do something.

2131
04:08:41,020 --> 04:08:44,729
Someone's going to fuck with me here. The walls are going to collapse

2132
04:08:44,729 --> 04:08:46,729
and a bunch of gorillas are going to

2133
04:08:46,729 --> 04:08:50,829
attack me in here.

2134
04:08:50,829 --> 04:08:57,799
This is a prank room. But it's not done yet.

2135
04:08:57,799 --> 04:09:11,930
Let me finish it.

2136
04:09:11,930 --> 04:09:15,579
I need pool lights.

2137
04:09:15,579 --> 04:09:19,159
Do they have pool lights?

2138
04:09:19,159 --> 04:09:27,930
I don't think so. Well, that's going up.

2139
04:09:27,930 --> 04:09:31,840
That's a Krusty Krab thing.

2140
04:09:31,840 --> 04:09:47,389
What color is this? I don't want it too bright.

2141
04:09:47,389 --> 04:09:51,290
This seems pretty relaxing.

2142
04:09:51,290 --> 04:10:13,120
It's too many.

2143
04:10:13,120 --> 04:10:18,559
Well, it says they were small.

2144
04:10:18,559 --> 04:10:33,129
Why is it so bright?

2145
04:10:33,129 --> 04:10:35,440
Put up fairy lights? Do they have them?

2146
04:10:35,440 --> 04:10:41,069
I don't think they have stuff like that.

2147
04:10:41,069 --> 04:11:01,610
Stop putting it away.

2148
04:11:01,610 --> 04:11:47,739
There's no water even in there.

2149
04:11:47,739 --> 04:12:17,950
Neons. I got to get this brick out of here.

2150
04:12:17,950 --> 04:12:34,909
It's pissing me off. I'm going to

2151
04:12:34,909 --> 04:12:36,909
buy like 5,000 of these.

2152
04:12:36,909 --> 04:12:39,340
So I just never have to buy them again.

2153
04:12:39,340 --> 04:12:41,840
I don't care if I store them in a fucking shed in the backyard.

2154
04:12:41,840 --> 04:13:13,819
Jesus.

2155
04:13:13,819 --> 04:13:15,819
If I touch the water,

2156
04:13:15,819 --> 04:13:17,819
everything goes away.

2157
04:13:17,819 --> 04:13:34,139
Hey, could you go this song?

2158
04:13:34,139 --> 04:13:42,059
Let me listen to it again.

2159
04:13:42,059 --> 04:13:51,659
What does it go?

2160
04:14:03,290 --> 04:14:17,879
It's so old.

2161
04:14:17,879 --> 04:14:20,379
That's a very old meme.

2162
04:14:20,379 --> 04:14:30,940
I am not trapped. I'll be okay.

2163
04:14:30,940 --> 04:14:33,629
Because I'm going to make an opening

2164
04:14:33,629 --> 04:14:36,639
over here.

2165
04:14:36,639 --> 04:15:23,719
The door will probably be right here.

2166
04:15:23,719 --> 04:15:25,719
Now, there's a door right here, isn't there?

2167
04:15:25,719 --> 04:15:29,930
Or am I making that up? Isn't there a door right here?

2168
04:15:29,930 --> 04:15:35,500
No, it's not.

2169
04:15:35,500 --> 04:15:49,559
Really? Okay.

2170
04:15:49,559 --> 04:15:52,059
House Slipper 2 comes out this year,

2171
04:15:52,059 --> 04:15:54,239
doesn't it? In like a few months.

2172
04:15:54,239 --> 04:15:56,670
I think that's when it's

2173
04:15:56,670 --> 04:16:12,409
planning on coming out.

2174
04:16:12,409 --> 04:16:16,379
4 to 3? Cool.

2175
04:16:16,379 --> 04:16:31,680
100% we're playing it.

2176
04:16:31,680 --> 04:16:34,489
So now, I've got to fix that.

2177
04:16:34,489 --> 04:16:37,049
I've got to add the green

2178
04:16:37,049 --> 04:16:39,049
here and then the walls.

2179
04:16:39,049 --> 04:16:41,479
So let's buy a shitload of the walls.

2180
04:16:41,479 --> 04:16:49,799
I wish the recently purchased was bigger than this.

2181
04:16:49,799 --> 04:16:53,319
Instead of having to go to

2182
04:16:53,319 --> 04:16:56,139
walls and then all the way down.

2183
04:16:56,139 --> 04:16:59,709
Because I know what I want.

2184
04:16:59,709 --> 04:17:01,709
Or I could just remember how to type it into the search bar.

2185
04:17:01,709 --> 04:17:04,969
Instead of just glazing over

2186
04:17:04,969 --> 04:17:06,969
what it's called every single time.

2187
04:17:06,969 --> 04:17:18,670
You guys like this one?

2188
04:17:18,670 --> 04:17:30,120
Floors.

2189
04:17:30,120 --> 04:17:33,200
It was the green.

2190
04:17:33,200 --> 04:17:35,500
Was it a tile or was it a panel?

2191
04:17:35,500 --> 04:17:38,059
It was pretty far down.

2192
04:17:38,059 --> 04:17:50,159
Crusty Crab.

2193
04:17:50,159 --> 04:17:57,389
Now,

2194
04:17:57,389 --> 04:17:59,389
that's it for the floors of the Crusty Crab.

2195
04:17:59,389 --> 04:18:01,389
We're getting close to being done with this.

2196
04:18:01,389 --> 04:18:03,389
Then I just have to finish the upstairs.

2197
04:18:03,389 --> 04:18:09,719
Do I want any weird lights in here?

2198
04:18:09,719 --> 04:18:23,399
Hmm.

2199
04:18:23,399 --> 04:18:25,399
I don't think I want any lights in here.

2200
04:18:25,399 --> 04:18:40,319
Besides the ones that are already there.

2201
04:18:40,319 --> 04:18:42,319
I'm going to put, uh, this should be it though.

2202
04:18:42,319 --> 04:18:44,319
Yeah. Alright. So I need like

2203
04:18:44,319 --> 04:18:56,270
probably enough.

2204
04:18:56,270 --> 04:18:58,270
Why do I always have to do that?

2205
04:18:58,270 --> 04:19:00,889
Change the roof? Yeah, well, I'll mess around with the

2206
04:19:00,889 --> 04:19:09,399
exterior in a minute. Alright, so the next time

2207
04:19:09,399 --> 04:19:11,399
I play this, which will be at some point

2208
04:19:11,399 --> 04:19:13,399
soon. I'm not, the stream's not over by the way.

2209
04:19:13,399 --> 04:19:15,399
Um, but we will actually

2210
04:19:15,399 --> 04:19:20,190
cows and horses into stuff.

2211
04:19:20,190 --> 04:19:22,190
He got me on this Crusty Crab thing and I'm

2212
04:19:22,190 --> 04:19:42,969
stuck on it.

2213
04:19:42,969 --> 04:19:44,969
Favorite childhood snack. That's a good one.

2214
04:19:44,969 --> 04:19:49,129
Uh, PB Crisps.

2215
04:19:49,129 --> 04:19:52,440
They don't make them anymore.

2216
04:19:52,440 --> 04:19:54,440
I don't know what was in them. I don't know

2217
04:19:54,440 --> 04:19:57,069
why they won't bring them back.

2218
04:19:57,069 --> 04:19:59,069
Those were my favorite snack. Probably ever.

2219
04:19:59,069 --> 04:20:03,280
They're gone forever.

2220
04:20:03,280 --> 04:20:18,120
Actually gone forever.

2221
04:20:18,120 --> 04:20:20,120
Mr. Crab's office is so bad.

2222
04:20:20,120 --> 04:20:24,860
Okay. Can I put wood on the ceiling?

2223
04:20:24,860 --> 04:20:40,139
Let me see.

2224
04:20:40,139 --> 04:20:42,139
As it said, panels, right?

2225
04:20:42,139 --> 04:20:44,139
Floor and ceiling? Floor and ceiling panels.

2226
04:20:44,139 --> 04:20:53,420
I can.

2227
04:20:53,420 --> 04:20:57,129
What kind of, what is it? It's a little darker than this.

2228
04:20:57,129 --> 04:21:04,729
This? Mmm, that's kind of

2229
04:21:04,729 --> 04:21:06,909
alright. Is that good enough?

2230
04:21:06,909 --> 04:21:29,040
I think it's fine.

2231
04:21:29,040 --> 04:21:33,200
Can you play less sad music?

2232
04:21:33,200 --> 04:21:35,200
This is a little somber, isn't it? Okay.

2233
04:21:35,200 --> 04:22:00,719
Um, how about, what's something we can put on?

2234
04:22:00,719 --> 04:22:03,659
Sims buy mode? I like that one.

2235
04:22:03,659 --> 04:22:28,280
Cool.

2236
04:22:28,280 --> 04:22:31,290
Alright. We need to make this area cool looking.

2237
04:22:31,290 --> 04:22:34,299
Relaxing Gran Turismo

2238
04:22:34,299 --> 04:22:36,299
music to help you relax.

2239
04:22:36,299 --> 04:22:50,940
Really? I dig it. I'm into it.

2240
04:22:50,940 --> 04:23:27,920
Let's see if it helps. What's the outside of the Krusty

2241
04:23:27,920 --> 04:23:37,629
Crab look like? Let's see.

2242
04:23:37,629 --> 04:23:39,629
Krusty Crab. It's really good. It's kind of

2243
04:23:39,629 --> 04:23:42,760
green. It's like

2244
04:23:42,760 --> 04:23:52,299
olive. It's kind of like olive

2245
04:23:52,299 --> 04:24:05,079
wood. It's brown?

2246
04:24:05,079 --> 04:24:11,340
This looks kind of green.

2247
04:24:11,340 --> 04:24:13,340
It's wood covered with algae.

2248
04:24:13,340 --> 04:24:15,340
Oh. I mean, it's still green looking.

2249
04:24:15,340 --> 04:24:28,649
Dude, this shit is green.

2250
04:24:28,649 --> 04:24:30,959
This shit is literally green.

2251
04:24:30,959 --> 04:24:33,260
This is not

2252
04:24:33,260 --> 04:24:35,260
brown.

2253
04:24:35,260 --> 04:24:37,260
This is green. This is a green

2254
04:24:37,260 --> 04:24:50,059
tinted brown. Show us.

2255
04:24:50,059 --> 04:25:03,950
Show us.

2256
04:25:03,950 --> 04:25:06,889
All these Krusty Crabs.

2257
04:25:06,889 --> 04:25:13,930
Krusty Crab exterior.

2258
04:25:13,930 --> 04:25:17,069
This shit is green.

2259
04:25:17,069 --> 04:25:44,520
This shit's green. That's green.

2260
04:25:44,520 --> 04:25:47,719
That's brown and green.

2261
04:25:47,719 --> 04:25:58,590
Look at all that green.

2262
04:25:58,590 --> 04:26:00,590
It's wood with moss.

2263
04:26:00,590 --> 04:26:02,590
Yeah, but I mean, it's still like, how am I

2264
04:26:02,590 --> 04:26:04,590
how do I get that to look like that?

2265
04:26:04,590 --> 04:26:06,760
This is going to have to be just brown.

2266
04:26:06,760 --> 04:26:18,159
What is brown? Shit's green.

2267
04:26:18,159 --> 04:26:23,659
I thought my game crashed. I was

2268
04:26:23,659 --> 04:26:27,309
supposed to be really sad.

2269
04:26:27,309 --> 04:26:29,309
That's brown with green on it.

2270
04:26:29,309 --> 04:26:31,739
I don't know why I think that's so funny.

2271
04:26:31,739 --> 04:26:41,399
I'm moving on.

2272
04:26:41,399 --> 04:26:48,569
All right.

2273
04:26:48,569 --> 04:26:50,569
All right.

2274
04:26:50,569 --> 04:27:02,799
All right. Windows jump

2275
04:27:02,799 --> 04:27:04,799
scare. Oh shit. Sorry. I didn't realize it was

2276
04:27:04,799 --> 04:27:10,750
turned up. Well, just do

2277
04:27:10,750 --> 04:27:14,520
this. I

2278
04:27:14,520 --> 04:27:16,520
need it. No, I'm not doing the exterior.

2279
04:27:16,520 --> 04:27:21,319
I do want to pull in that

2280
04:27:21,319 --> 04:27:23,319
sign though. The menu.

2281
04:27:23,319 --> 04:27:25,819
Mod linked it here.

2282
04:27:25,819 --> 04:27:31,239
Galley Grub.

2283
04:27:31,239 --> 04:27:33,239
How do I add this?

2284
04:27:33,239 --> 04:27:38,670
I think I have to pull it in.

2285
04:27:38,670 --> 04:27:50,250
Save this link.

2286
04:27:50,250 --> 04:27:58,889
So much shit on my desktop.

2287
04:27:58,889 --> 04:28:11,180
Windows sound incoming. Let me turn it down.

2288
04:28:11,180 --> 04:28:20,909
So here is what the I'm going to try to get the

2289
04:28:20,909 --> 04:28:22,909
menu into the game. And this is what I'm trying

2290
04:28:22,909 --> 04:28:28,219
to put in here. So then I go.

2291
04:28:28,219 --> 04:28:33,979
I think it's like a camera gallery.

2292
04:28:33,979 --> 04:28:35,979
I got a lot of shit on my desktop.

2293
04:28:35,979 --> 04:28:54,329
So I'm going to do this.

2294
04:28:54,329 --> 04:29:00,030
All right. Let's go. How big should it be?

2295
04:29:00,030 --> 04:29:17,399
Where does it go? I'm right there, right?

2296
04:29:17,399 --> 04:29:20,989
Is it bigger? A little bit bigger.

2297
04:29:20,989 --> 04:29:39,790
Is that too big? That's not bad.

2298
04:29:39,790 --> 04:29:47,850
Can it hang from the ceiling? I don't think

2299
04:29:47,850 --> 04:29:55,979
so, unfortunately. Yeah. And everybody

2300
04:29:55,979 --> 04:29:57,979
was telling me that this was not going to

2301
04:29:57,979 --> 04:29:59,979
even look remotely like the Krusty

2302
04:29:59,979 --> 04:30:02,729
Krab. And we're not even done.

2303
04:30:02,729 --> 04:30:04,969
Finishing touches is all that

2304
04:30:04,969 --> 04:30:09,260
matter. The bathroom is way too big.

2305
04:30:09,260 --> 04:30:13,610
I have to

2306
04:30:13,610 --> 04:30:15,610
do this room. This room is just a placeholder.

2307
04:30:15,610 --> 04:30:20,600
I got to get this a little bit

2308
04:30:20,600 --> 04:30:25,850
nicer looking. Playing with this is to

2309
04:30:25,850 --> 04:30:30,889
go like this.

2310
04:30:30,889 --> 04:30:43,950
All right. One thing at a time. What do I want to add?

2311
04:30:43,950 --> 04:30:45,950
Is there anything down the hallway in the Krusty Krab

2312
04:30:45,950 --> 04:30:58,620
here? It is hanging. Oh, there's an order

2313
04:30:58,620 --> 04:31:02,969
here assigned to. I want to see

2314
04:31:02,969 --> 04:31:04,969
if I can get some nautical stuff here because there's

2315
04:31:04,969 --> 04:31:14,299
let me see. What

2316
04:31:14,299 --> 04:31:16,799
do you like? Anchor? Like a ship

2317
04:31:16,799 --> 04:31:20,170
anchor. Like ship.

2318
04:31:20,170 --> 04:31:22,170
Oh, OK.

2319
04:31:22,170 --> 04:31:24,729
I know I can put one of these

2320
04:31:24,729 --> 04:31:30,920
somewhere. Bingo.

2321
04:31:30,920 --> 04:31:33,549
And where should this go?

2322
04:31:33,549 --> 04:31:40,719
In the office?

2323
04:31:40,719 --> 04:31:44,680
This needs a total complete

2324
04:31:44,680 --> 04:31:48,969
reimagining. I could go to the steam workshop

2325
04:31:48,969 --> 04:31:51,209
too. I could do the steam workshop.

2326
04:31:51,209 --> 04:32:02,600
Nice Gmod office. I

2327
04:32:02,600 --> 04:32:07,659
know. Is a mini safe. All right.

2328
04:32:07,659 --> 04:32:09,659
So is there anything else in this main

2329
04:32:09,659 --> 04:32:12,280
room that is not here that

2330
04:32:12,280 --> 04:32:27,370
needs to be here? The sinks?

2331
04:32:27,370 --> 04:32:29,370
I can't really put glass over here because it won't.

2332
04:32:29,370 --> 04:32:34,219
You need wooden pillars.

2333
04:32:34,219 --> 04:32:36,219
Hmm. Wooden pillars.

2334
04:32:36,219 --> 04:32:39,340
All right. Fix the hole

2335
04:32:39,340 --> 04:32:44,459
where the pillar is. Let me look.

2336
04:32:44,459 --> 04:32:59,049
OK, they I don't think I can put those

2337
04:32:59,049 --> 04:33:01,049
in. They go across the ceiling, right?

2338
04:33:01,049 --> 04:33:05,849
Well, look, there's a couple that are on the ground.

2339
04:33:05,849 --> 04:33:07,849
Looks like to the left and right of the door

2340
04:33:07,849 --> 04:33:10,540
the entrance. If I go like

2341
04:33:10,540 --> 04:33:14,060
this, they're kind of like

2342
04:33:14,060 --> 04:33:16,299
here and here.

2343
04:33:16,299 --> 04:33:29,290
It's got to be

2344
04:33:29,290 --> 04:33:36,779
the same on both sides. It's a little bit tighter.

2345
04:33:36,779 --> 04:33:39,209
It's like here. But for aesthetic reasons

2346
04:33:39,209 --> 04:34:18,509
I'm putting it here. Are you still going to add goats?

2347
04:34:18,509 --> 04:34:20,680
Yeah, I kind of

2348
04:34:20,680 --> 04:34:22,680
threw away the whole farming DLC

2349
04:34:22,680 --> 04:34:25,180
and yeah, that's

2350
04:34:25,180 --> 04:34:37,080
unfortunate. We'll do it again.

2351
04:34:37,080 --> 04:34:41,240
This is just wood, but I don't want to build that yet. All right.

2352
04:34:41,240 --> 04:34:51,599
So this needs to be like here, right

2353
04:34:51,599 --> 04:35:00,090
here. Should be thicker. Really

2354
04:35:00,090 --> 04:35:34,459
sell what it is. It's wood walls.

2355
04:35:34,459 --> 04:35:40,139
These are pretty good. They're kind of

2356
04:35:40,139 --> 04:35:43,979
selling. These are a little dusty.

2357
04:35:43,979 --> 04:36:01,709
Let's try these. Use farm animals

2358
04:36:01,709 --> 04:36:03,709
for customers. That's actually a

2359
04:36:03,709 --> 04:36:35,959
pretty funny idea. This in the corner.

2360
04:36:35,959 --> 04:37:14,479
Pretty good.

2361
04:37:14,479 --> 04:37:28,360
Is it going to sit a little bit tighter in here?

2362
04:37:28,360 --> 04:37:42,880
Together. You missed a spot.

2363
04:37:42,880 --> 04:37:44,880
Doesn't match, but I don't think it really needs to.

2364
04:37:44,880 --> 04:37:51,979
Bathroom is the way it is. This is

2365
04:37:51,979 --> 04:37:59,529
my sanctuary over here. That'll have to

2366
04:37:59,529 --> 04:38:04,720
do. This is the room I want to tackle now.

2367
04:38:04,720 --> 04:38:09,259
The door to Mr. Krabs office

2368
04:38:09,259 --> 04:38:16,139
is left or right?

2369
04:38:16,139 --> 04:38:18,139
Is it closer to the wall or is it more in the middle?

2370
04:38:18,139 --> 04:38:33,680
It's the one in the middle, right? Yeah. Build this up.

2371
04:38:33,680 --> 04:38:48,759
What about the barrels? We'll do some touch up.

2372
04:38:48,759 --> 04:38:56,700
And the door. I'm going to have to keep using

2373
04:38:56,700 --> 04:38:58,700
these weird sci-fi doors, unfortunately.

2374
04:38:58,700 --> 04:39:39,069
Hmm. These look quiet.

2375
04:39:39,069 --> 04:39:58,509
Oops.

2376
04:39:58,509 --> 04:40:00,509
I like it. It's cool.

2377
04:40:00,509 --> 04:40:04,220
Here's the fridge. But we keep that closed

2378
04:40:04,220 --> 04:40:06,830
because I don't want anyone to see.

2379
04:40:06,830 --> 04:40:10,479
Oh, we've got more logos. Hold on. I've got to put these

2380
04:40:10,479 --> 04:40:34,080
in. Okay.

2381
04:40:34,080 --> 04:40:55,950
It's one too. Okay.

2382
04:40:55,950 --> 04:40:58,950
You can't see anything?

2383
04:40:58,950 --> 04:41:00,950
Yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip.

2384
04:41:00,950 --> 04:41:03,889
Yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip.

2385
04:41:03,889 --> 04:41:14,279
Yip. Yip.

2386
04:41:14,279 --> 04:41:19,080
I might as well. Oh, there's a raid!

2387
04:41:19,080 --> 04:41:21,080
Oh my god, I got to turn this rain back on.

2388
04:41:21,080 --> 04:41:23,080
But I don't want you guys to see this yet. Hold on.

2389
04:41:23,080 --> 04:41:25,080
I don't want you to see this. This is very important.

2390
04:41:25,080 --> 04:41:31,990
This is where my sanctuary is.

2391
04:41:31,990 --> 04:41:35,150
I'm okay if you see it just didn't want you to see this because it's a surprise

2392
04:41:35,830 --> 04:41:45,209
Hello, welcome. Welcome vine sauce viewers. Thanks a lot, Vinny. Welcome

2393
04:41:46,270 --> 04:41:52,819
This is a surprise for chat. So I'm sorry. I took a little bit longer playing house flipper. Thanks for the raid. Welcome

2394
04:41:52,840 --> 04:41:55,939
We are currently

2395
04:41:55,939 --> 04:42:01,439
Doing something very important. We are recreating one to one

2396
04:42:01,759 --> 04:42:12,569
Not a single detail missed of the Krusty Krab and house flipper doing my best. I think it's going pretty good so far

2397
04:42:13,130 --> 04:42:21,619
We're working on it. And then I've also of course besides the Krusty Krab. I also have my sanctuary over here

2398
04:42:21,900 --> 04:42:52,500
Which has been recently updated. I'm leaving this house. Please. Don't mind the poop chairs. They're temporary

2399
04:42:54,299 --> 04:43:05,740
Alright, hold on. I got some other things to put in here. This is much smaller. All right. Yeah, like right there

2400
04:43:06,259 --> 04:43:25,709
How am I gonna do this? I don't think that works. Can I put it on a tree?

2401
04:43:36,610 --> 04:43:39,290
Why do I feel like I'm walking through?

2402
04:43:39,849 --> 04:43:41,849
One of those like Disney

2403
04:43:42,049 --> 04:43:49,569
Experiences where it's the Krusty Krab. Oh, whoa, I can actually walk around the Krusty Krab. This is so cool

2404
04:43:49,569 --> 04:43:56,340
And then it's just a store in here. This is a huge gift shop with tons of toys and

2405
04:43:57,930 --> 04:43:59,729
plushes and

2406
04:43:59,729 --> 04:44:05,970
Stickers and and you can eat here. You can sit here and eat here

2407
04:44:06,490 --> 04:44:14,389
but hey, but those of you that just joined us and some of you that have been here or

2408
04:44:14,389 --> 04:44:21,459
Some of you that have been here for a while have not seen all of it. So of course, this is we're not done

2409
04:44:21,979 --> 04:44:24,150
This is obviously

2410
04:44:24,970 --> 04:44:29,470
Spongebob's office Spongebob's work area. He's the cook. We got the window here meet a little bit of cleaning up here

2411
04:44:29,889 --> 04:44:33,810
There's a lot to do here. But wait till you see mr. Krabs office

2412
04:44:34,250 --> 04:44:39,750
I'm telling you right now. You are about to be floored with how accurate this is

2413
04:44:40,290 --> 04:44:52,580
But here's the bathroom though a little bit of extra space

2414
04:44:53,220 --> 04:45:07,409
All the toilets work dude, the floor is really carrying it really is without this floor. It was awful

2415
04:45:07,909 --> 04:45:15,599
All right. I'm happy with this so far. I think this isn't going pretty well

2416
04:45:16,119 --> 04:45:30,099
Let's tackle this room because this I just I don't I don't love it. I don't love it. Okay

2417
04:45:30,419 --> 04:45:45,250
What was Vinnie playing tonight? What's Vinnie doing 90s stuff? Oh

2418
04:45:48,860 --> 04:45:50,860
Obscure 90s websites. Ooh

2419
04:45:51,220 --> 04:45:54,029
Sounds pretty good. Okay

2420
04:45:54,549 --> 04:45:56,549
We need a shelf over here

2421
04:45:57,650 --> 04:46:02,049
There's another grill that's there's a second grill right old virtual world

2422
04:46:02,650 --> 04:46:46,729
There's another oven right here. It's too big. It's too big. I can't put it anywhere

2423
04:46:46,729 --> 04:47:13,290
I would pay thirty five thousand dollars for that. I wouldn't so I need an oven or a stove

2424
04:47:13,450 --> 04:47:18,139
There's a second one. What color is it? It's like, um, there's a couple of barrels

2425
04:47:18,340 --> 04:47:21,869
Let me put the barrels in first because I think those those go against back wall

2426
04:47:24,779 --> 04:47:43,610
Yeah, these go like here this I think it's too good how the ceiling needs to be wood

2427
04:47:44,290 --> 04:47:47,490
Shit. All right. Well, I gotta do that right now

2428
04:47:48,090 --> 04:47:54,750
Don't forget the Krabby Patty poster

2429
04:47:55,810 --> 04:48:20,229
Can I get it? Can a mod link me the Krabby Patty poster? You know, the craziest part about this house is

2430
04:48:20,709 --> 04:48:30,159
There's an entire upstairs that has bedrooms and bathrooms in it and it's sealed off forever

2431
04:48:31,180 --> 04:48:43,930
Never to be opened. I think that's pretty clear

2432
04:48:44,450 --> 04:48:46,450
All right, I need to fix the walls over there

2433
04:48:46,970 --> 04:49:05,069
Plenty of these good make sure you add a secret ladder to the upstairs crack addict

2434
04:49:05,150 --> 04:49:13,479
Yeah, I'm gonna hide that though because I don't want anybody to see it. So I'm gonna hide it like over here

2435
04:49:13,720 --> 04:49:22,830
I'm not even sure I can get upstairs ever again. I'm serious. I don't think I can get up there

2436
04:49:23,389 --> 04:49:40,540
What where am I?

2437
04:49:40,540 --> 04:50:00,689
What the hell? Uh, oh cool. You can change the roof, huh?

2438
04:50:06,380 --> 04:50:12,540
Wait, I didn't process that at all. How do I get to the roof tool? Oh

2439
04:50:25,279 --> 04:50:54,630
Cool. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What's the what's the top of the Krusty Krab? What? Yeah, no one's gonna look at the roof

2440
04:50:54,630 --> 04:50:57,349
All right. Well, this isn't the wrong spot. So where am I gonna put this?

2441
04:50:57,349 --> 04:51:06,459
I mean that can stay but so I need to it's gonna be like away from my sanctuary

2442
04:51:06,459 --> 04:51:49,009
Right, that makes sense. The hell is the rest of the house put it above the pool

2443
04:51:49,009 --> 04:51:59,880
Yeah, I was just trying to but I don't think I can get up there. It doesn't like that. The pool is there

2444
04:52:15,729 --> 04:52:24,330
The bathtub up there I think it has to just be maybe wait, okay, wait, wait, wait, maybe in the corner

2445
04:52:24,330 --> 04:53:00,119
I can do it right. Okay, I can do it right here. I want this be hidden though. All right

2446
04:53:00,119 --> 04:53:23,770
What is did I do it again? I don't care. Nice. Grab your fatty only at the Krusty Krab. Oh, I'll take that one

2447
04:53:23,790 --> 04:53:32,090
Wait a minute. What is that? I'm taking this downstairs

2448
04:53:32,290 --> 04:53:55,240
What a mirror be better here a mirror on this side and a mirror on that side. That would be kind of fine, right?

2449
04:53:55,279 --> 04:54:14,709
That might be actually pretty good. All right. There are some boxes in here. I got the food over there

2450
04:54:14,709 --> 04:54:34,610
I got the two barrels. There is a window. I actually think this is pretty good so far. Oh, wait, hold on

2451
04:54:34,610 --> 04:54:40,229
Yep. All right, Krusty Krab only a crab fatty only the Krusty Krab. All right. Come on. I don't want to spoil

2452
04:54:40,310 --> 04:55:18,639
Okay, any more any more I should put in I think that'll do it. Yeah, that should be fine

2453
04:55:18,720 --> 04:56:02,069
That should tie the whole room together now. You can look it's not that big. It's a little smaller. Yes, not bad

2454
04:56:02,069 --> 04:56:21,479
This is kind of ugly, but the vampire picture of you behind. No, this is it. That's for my sanctuary

2455
04:56:21,479 --> 04:56:27,430
I need some lights in here that I need a nice light and I'll be happy

2456
04:56:27,810 --> 04:57:04,430
Something very basic. Yep mood lighting exactly string light. I think they do unfortunately. It's okay. We like the chandelier. Ah

2457
04:57:10,099 --> 04:57:19,500
Hey, I hate this picture. It's so stupid. It's too well lit for that photo to be in here

2458
04:57:19,659 --> 04:57:48,549
What about like candles candles make more sense? Oh, I'm gonna make I'm gonna make a blood-borne room

2459
04:57:48,549 --> 04:58:21,369
I'm gonna make a dark souls. I'm gonna pick a from software room pretty good

2460
04:58:21,389 --> 04:58:36,139
I'll put a bonfire in the middle now. I'm sorry. There's not enough candles in this room

2461
04:58:36,180 --> 04:59:10,479
Okay, now it's officially a from software room

2462
04:59:19,569 --> 04:59:21,569
Is this your grave?

2463
04:59:21,729 --> 04:59:28,959
Vampire German grave, how did it get darker? How did I get darker?

2464
04:59:33,750 --> 04:59:42,000
This shit's on your walls. Wait, is there like a coffin? Hold on. Is there like a vampire coffin?

2465
04:59:42,000 --> 04:59:46,220
Why would there be what I'm looking? Oh my goodness. There is

2466
05:00:05,659 --> 05:00:07,659
the crusty crab

2467
05:00:11,599 --> 05:00:56,299
I think the candles are going out. I think that's the problem. He's be bigger than this. I think that's a good size

2468
05:01:04,000 --> 05:01:31,430
Fucked up. Yeah, he wanted to be he wanted to be put into a casket in his sanctuary room. He's not in there

2469
05:01:31,590 --> 05:01:53,500
He just really liked this place. He's in there don't open that open have it have the casket open

2470
05:01:53,500 --> 05:02:03,669
I don't think I can I love it. All right, I need a door there or should there not even be a door

2471
05:02:03,990 --> 05:02:05,990
Just just waltz into this

2472
05:02:13,680 --> 05:02:18,709
Okay. Um, I need like a shitty door. It's like a rickety door

2473
05:02:18,869 --> 05:02:43,439
This might be nice to get the shit out of somebody too. It's an outhouse. Yeah, please wash your oh, hold on

2474
05:02:43,439 --> 05:03:03,849
I got another image. This is a good one. This is a weird question

2475
05:03:03,849 --> 05:03:08,450
Does anybody have any more vampire pictures of me? Like that's a weird question to ask

2476
05:03:08,889 --> 05:03:35,759
Okay, hold on. Do you want safe? All right. Okay. Look at this ready

2477
05:03:38,849 --> 05:04:01,250
Yeah, turn the stream off dude, but we're probably getting close once we start doing shit like this

2478
05:04:06,470 --> 05:04:10,150
God all right that one hat that's going it. I don't this this is

2479
05:04:10,709 --> 05:04:15,959
Why would why do you have this? Why do you have this already? Like why do you own this?

2480
05:04:15,959 --> 05:04:18,080
I don't know. I can't understand why you would own this image

2481
05:04:18,439 --> 05:04:34,369
The question is does is this what goes on top of the door or is this go in the room, too?

2482
05:04:34,689 --> 05:04:57,119
I'll let you see in a second. Is this this is like an advertisement for like who's in here

2483
05:04:57,119 --> 05:05:12,950
I want to put like a big floodlight on that. Oh, jeez. Hold on

2484
05:05:12,950 --> 05:05:16,349
All right. Let me add one more and this is not turning into the saw house again

2485
05:05:16,349 --> 05:05:22,889
But like this is just too much. How is this? I can't believe this is a real person's face

2486
05:05:22,889 --> 05:05:38,029
I honestly don't understand. This is a real human being no spoilers

2487
05:05:48,360 --> 05:05:57,560
You know, honestly though, I'll be honest I've come to terms over the years with

2488
05:05:58,240 --> 05:06:04,700
Just how truly fucking strange my face can look sometimes and it's I just it's funny

2489
05:06:04,700 --> 05:06:36,500
I don't even care. The question is where does this one go that it's not even if it's not even me. Yeah

2490
05:06:39,389 --> 05:06:44,669
Alright, I think I'm done. I think I'm done. I think we've gone. We've gone a little bit too far

2491
05:06:44,669 --> 05:06:50,369
Uh, I think I'm done and that was really I don't know. I wanted I want the before-and-after pictures

2492
05:06:50,369 --> 05:07:07,720
Oh shit, I forgot about this. Hold on. I want the before-and-after photos. We'll make sure to move your office here

2493
05:07:10,240 --> 05:07:15,869
Do one final tour. Okay, welcome and we maybe we're not done

2494
05:07:16,229 --> 05:07:29,330
I'll make sure I'll move my office here. Wait, don't forget about the garden. Don't forget about the full send spongebob laugh. Okay

2495
05:07:34,180 --> 05:08:07,159
It's I can't do it. Should these be in the room here? I didn't like that at all

2496
05:08:07,159 --> 05:08:24,889
I find me somebody that did what about the animal customers? Alright, let's get some animal customers in here

2497
05:08:39,159 --> 05:08:57,840
Where are they? Where are they?

2498
05:08:57,840 --> 05:09:02,000
Arming well, how did I find it before? Oh, wait, wait, wait. I think it's actually from a different menu

2499
05:09:02,000 --> 05:09:13,330
I think I have to do it from the laptop. Yeah. All right. I gotta move my office

2500
05:09:13,330 --> 05:09:20,299
Let me save this and we're gonna go back to my office. So back to the office save the progress

2501
05:09:20,380 --> 05:09:38,009
Could I've done from that menu? Oh shit. I thought I had to use I thought I had to pick up the laptop and move it

2502
05:09:38,009 --> 05:10:02,419
There so could I have actually just gone there? Oh shit. I own this the option was immediately beneath what you clicked

2503
05:10:02,419 --> 05:10:33,330
Yeah, but when you have tunnel vision like I do sometimes it's burning. All right. Well, let's see how that's going

2504
05:10:33,330 --> 05:10:48,909
Mr. Grabs room in development by the way, so we just have

2505
05:10:49,430 --> 05:12:12,000
Animal customers. I just want to see what I'm just curious. Okay. I don't even know if I can do this. What?

2506
05:12:13,080 --> 05:12:54,240
Why can't I move? Oh, look at the little pig you guys want to see? All right, follow me. Take a look at this place

2507
05:12:54,360 --> 05:13:56,959
All right. I'm ready. Here's a carrot. No, these are spongebob characters. That's Squidward. Oh, wait, hold on. What about the pig?

2508
05:13:57,040 --> 05:14:26,340
This is cute. I like this. What's wrong? Are you okay? Are you good?

2509
05:14:26,380 --> 05:14:43,580
Doesn't need anything and there are other there's other animals out here. Oh, hi. Hello. What is that?

2510
05:14:43,580 --> 05:14:58,270
What what animals making that sound by the way? No one's gonna eat here

2511
05:15:03,150 --> 05:15:05,150
You okay?

2512
05:15:05,389 --> 05:15:18,459
Be in this room the health department is gonna be pissed. Oh, can I put like feeding troughs in here?

2513
05:15:18,619 --> 05:15:33,200
Don't go in the vampire room though. It's not safe in there. Okay, I need

2514
05:15:35,020 --> 05:15:44,220
Where do I buy food? Oh, no animal care. It's right here. Okay

2515
05:15:44,380 --> 05:15:49,979
Okay

2516
05:15:49,979 --> 05:15:56,330
Imagine going to a place to like a restaurant and there was just like cow and pig feeding troughs inside

2517
05:15:57,169 --> 05:16:11,569
It's a salad bar. Yeah, that's true. I need water

2518
05:16:13,900 --> 05:16:50,939
Hmm. Oh, okay. They're eating. Okay. They're eating. They're eating. You just ate the whole thing. What? Oh, no, the secret formula

2519
05:16:51,419 --> 05:17:18,060
It's pig slough. Oh, wait, the big ones coming in. I only need some water like a watering thing

2520
05:17:18,139 --> 05:17:48,900
Here we go. All right, things are going good. Why are they farm animals in this? I'm so lost

2521
05:17:48,900 --> 05:17:55,990
Um, this is a new update and we're just literally playing it for the first time right now not the last like five and a half hours

2522
05:18:05,880 --> 05:18:35,090
What is that animal? Is it you I'll pack is really do just look like spore characters. Is it good? Oh you eat grass

2523
05:18:35,090 --> 05:19:00,200
Oh

2524
05:19:00,200 --> 05:19:10,299
Where'd it go? Okay. All right, that's it

2525
05:19:10,299 --> 05:19:23,560
I could get some more animals, but I don't think I I think I'm gonna call it you get a bunch of spiders

2526
05:19:23,560 --> 05:19:53,659
Oh my god, I can sleep here you

2527
05:20:02,400 --> 05:20:03,720
the way

2528
05:20:03,720 --> 05:20:18,919
Okay. Well, um, how do I get the before-and-after photos?

2529
05:20:18,919 --> 05:20:26,299
I think I have to sell the house, but I don't know if I want to sell this one

2530
05:20:26,299 --> 05:20:53,299
This one's too special to me. All right, follow me, please and you buy a duplicate. Um, you actually might be able to

2531
05:20:53,819 --> 05:21:14,520
Alright, it is my office now. Oh my god. There's a move button. Alright, I think that's it. That was a lot of fun

2532
05:21:14,599 --> 05:21:17,919
I'll probably play this again, but we'll actually make a farm next time

2533
05:21:18,419 --> 05:21:32,099
And not crusty crab just gonna hang out and play for a little while make the chum bucket next

2534
05:21:39,650 --> 05:21:52,189
Now thanks for hanging out I'll give one final tour those that didn't get to see every room we're gonna start

2535
05:21:53,189 --> 05:22:04,139
All right. It's time. How do I move move? What? Oh, this is not right

2536
05:22:06,779 --> 05:22:42,130
Something's not right. What are the horse? Where's the horse? Huh? Where's my horse upstairs? Maybe. All right, let's do the tour

2537
05:22:42,409 --> 05:22:46,819
Welcome to the Krusty Krab. I have we make our own fresh ingredients here

2538
05:22:49,700 --> 05:22:54,099
Apparently we don't because there's nothing's been planted in months. I guess but never mind

2539
05:22:54,619 --> 05:23:05,200
Here's the front door. I got a nice glass over here a nice. Well, there was supposed to be glass over there

2540
05:23:05,740 --> 05:23:21,619
Yeah, I don't don't mind the pigs and the cows and the animals and stuff. They're just hanging out. You can come in

2541
05:23:22,139 --> 05:23:24,659
Alright, so here's the Krusty Krab

2542
05:23:24,659 --> 05:23:27,150
Pretty good. I added some

2543
05:23:27,669 --> 05:23:34,740
Extra stuff and take it right here. See please wash your fins

2544
05:23:39,060 --> 05:23:43,310
bathroom

2545
05:23:43,310 --> 05:23:48,840
This is a secret exit which goes to the roof just in case you need to use it

2546
05:23:49,200 --> 05:24:02,319
He's the bathroom. There are no sinks in the bathroom. That's unfortunate. I'll fix that next time

2547
05:24:02,919 --> 05:24:20,779
Here is spongebob's room a shot-for-shot remake and put some stuff here in there. This is mr. Krabs office

2548
05:24:21,180 --> 05:24:35,299
The work in progress. Oh and of course the the vampire room

2549
05:24:36,020 --> 05:24:38,380
Or the from software room, whatever one you want to call it

2550
05:24:39,099 --> 05:25:24,619
Beautiful square pool pretty nice. What was that? That's shit. What is that animal? I swear

2551
05:25:24,900 --> 05:25:35,939
Okay, so there's that and then there's the upstairs which is the living quarters. Very cool

2552
05:25:36,340 --> 05:25:42,680
This still needs to be moved into I'm thinking of a big flat-screen television right here

2553
05:25:43,119 --> 05:25:48,659
Nice bath, maybe a little maybe upgrade the bath a little

2554
05:25:49,180 --> 05:25:54,490
Could be a little

2555
05:25:54,729 --> 05:26:24,459
Yoga studio, but you're very well behaved. You're very nice. You want some dress the horse

2556
05:26:24,459 --> 05:26:36,919
I don't know where the horse is horse is fine

2557
05:26:37,720 --> 05:27:07,689
Horse is not fine. Oh, no, you're good. All right, everybody's doing good. I'm gonna save it and I'm gonna call it

2558
05:27:08,909 --> 05:27:11,340
so I mentioned that I

2559
05:27:11,380 --> 05:27:19,360
Was probably gonna take a little bit of a break but not really

2560
05:27:20,930 --> 05:27:27,540
Wednesday this coming week stir and I are gonna play some games but besides Wednesday, I don't really have a plan

2561
05:27:28,020 --> 05:27:37,729
So Wednesday, we're gonna play hanging out stir and I and then maybe another stream later this coming week

2562
05:27:38,209 --> 05:27:40,939
but I

2563
05:27:40,939 --> 05:27:43,180
Only and I are gonna take a little bit of a break

2564
05:27:43,380 --> 05:27:49,479
Been doing a lot of grotto be stuff and we're

2565
05:27:50,040 --> 05:27:52,720
Incredibly happy that a lot of people have been getting their stuff

2566
05:27:52,720 --> 05:28:03,290
But a lot of work to do still up until I want to say a day or two ago

2567
05:28:03,450 --> 05:28:07,069
That's really kind of where I was for four or five straight days of off stream

2568
05:28:07,590 --> 05:28:16,229
When all the grotto be stuff, but I think I think we need to take a little bit of time together

2569
05:28:16,869 --> 05:28:28,720
But I'll see you Wednesday after Wednesday, maybe this weekend. It scares me every it actually scares me every time

2570
05:28:29,060 --> 05:28:36,959
But break as in there's only gonna be like one or two streams over the next week or so

2571
05:28:37,439 --> 05:28:47,220
Yeah, thanks for watching. This was fun. Pretty great update. I'm glad you can actually finally build a house

2572
05:28:50,340 --> 05:28:53,259
Adding additions to houses was always something I begged for

2573
05:28:54,180 --> 05:28:59,529
Five years ago, but you can finally build a house from the bottom up

2574
05:29:00,009 --> 05:29:06,849
But that's a huge deal. Can you please pet the baby pig? Yes

2575
05:29:07,369 --> 05:29:13,049
Come here find truffles

2576
05:29:13,490 --> 05:29:48,490
Did you find one? It's kind of looks like Otto with no hair. Have a tomato

2577
05:29:56,759 --> 05:30:07,319
You don't have to find any truffles. You can just relax. I love I can why you want to go in there so bad

2578
05:30:07,580 --> 05:30:22,009
What if what's in there? What are the wait aren't the ingredients to a Krabby Patty?

2579
05:30:22,169 --> 05:30:43,220
It's not meat right then it's something else. This is just fish crab. That's crab meat. It's a secret

2580
05:30:43,220 --> 05:30:56,060
Oh, it's human meat. It's veggie meat. I don't think anybody knows. All right. I'll see you guys on Wednesday

2581
05:30:56,099 --> 05:31:02,790
I'm gonna I'll hit up stir and see um exactly what we want to do

2582
05:31:03,189 --> 05:31:06,029
He mentioned he wanted to play orks must die free

2583
05:31:06,470 --> 05:31:14,919
So it might be a gamer stream on Wednesday. We also need to watch him play five nights at Freddy's

2584
05:31:17,520 --> 05:31:26,240
Imagining that will probably be part of that stream too. We'll see

2585
05:31:31,659 --> 05:31:34,200
This music was actually pretty relaxing. It was this is Gran Turismo

2586
05:31:34,979 --> 05:31:42,159
Gran Turismo

2587
05:31:42,159 --> 05:31:46,200
Okay, wait, let me make sure I save this

2588
05:31:50,080 --> 05:32:07,689
Yeah, it's safe. All right, and the music I did not forget the music

2589
05:32:21,389 --> 05:32:22,869
There it is

2590
05:32:22,869 --> 05:32:37,319
Yeah, also by the way, just to remind everybody one more time the limited items are about to leave the store in

2591
05:32:40,669 --> 05:32:48,069
15 20 minutes for grotto beasts. Yeah in about 10 minutes 10 20 at 11 59

2592
05:32:48,069 --> 05:32:56,150
The limited stuff is going off the store specific. That is the glow-in-the-dark

2593
05:32:56,869 --> 05:32:58,110
apparel

2594
05:32:58,110 --> 05:33:01,630
That's the original 40 grotto beasts and all the posters

2595
05:33:02,229 --> 05:33:03,509
jiggleberry

2596
05:33:03,509 --> 05:33:12,360
thoraxos and glue man those are all going off and I think the hats are going off too

2597
05:33:12,360 --> 05:33:16,959
the cards are still there though and we uh

2598
05:33:17,720 --> 05:33:25,860
For those of you that are still waiting for shipping updates, we are working on that right now for those of you that don't know

2599
05:33:27,020 --> 05:33:33,250
some of the early orders had some kind of issue a ton of orders have already gone out a

2600
05:33:34,810 --> 05:33:39,250
Massive amount of orders have been shipped and people have got it and we've seen a lot of really cool

2601
05:33:40,009 --> 05:33:42,889
Openings and unboxings and we're just really happy that people like it

2602
05:33:43,049 --> 05:33:48,189
But we want to make sure that the people that are still waiting for a shipping update

2603
05:33:48,650 --> 05:33:53,049
That they actually get as of tomorrow morning. We're meeting with represent

2604
05:33:53,169 --> 05:33:58,680
So we're gonna be talking about it trying to figure out a game plan, but it looks like it looks like they're gonna be

2605
05:34:00,000 --> 05:34:04,599
Starting to really go back and take a look at all those so we're working on it

2606
05:34:04,599 --> 05:34:08,000
We are those of you that are still waiting

2607
05:34:08,000 --> 05:34:15,779
The regular grotto be shirts are still up and they are staying there

2608
05:34:16,040 --> 05:34:21,619
Yes, like the logo shirt logo hoodie and obviously the cards

2609
05:34:21,880 --> 05:34:27,639
Yeah, the starter kit and the cards are all gonna be there

2610
05:34:27,680 --> 05:34:32,099
I will tell you the starter kits are not going to see a reprint

2611
05:34:32,299 --> 05:34:42,580
The plan is not to do a second print of the starter kit and it's still inventory

2612
05:34:43,020 --> 05:34:52,310
But that's something that is not going to see a reprint and we likely depending on how it all goes

2613
05:34:52,750 --> 05:34:55,430
We did a second print of the boosters already

2614
05:34:55,990 --> 05:35:00,240
So we'll see how that goes. We'll see how much inventory we have and

2615
05:35:00,959 --> 05:35:07,930
Make some decisions as that goes forward. Yeah, just want to give you some updates

2616
05:35:08,529 --> 05:35:13,930
What about a second edition?

2617
05:35:13,930 --> 05:35:23,520
What about the uncrusty grotto beast ad? Yep. I would expect that in the next few days

2618
05:35:23,900 --> 05:35:32,029
Yeah, just know that if you are still waiting if you had a March estimated ship

2619
05:35:33,880 --> 05:35:35,880
We are actively actively working on it

2620
05:35:36,159 --> 05:35:40,540
And thankfully it's it doesn't seem like it's a very large amount of people

2621
05:35:40,900 --> 05:35:44,939
But it's still even if it's a smaller percentage of all the orders or whatever it is

2622
05:35:45,500 --> 05:35:50,599
Wait, I don't we don't want that right? So we're trying to actively figure out how to fix it

2623
05:35:51,240 --> 05:36:09,459
Yes, the non glow-in-the-dark stuff is staying but the art prints are about to go away. Yes, Holly

2624
05:36:09,459 --> 05:36:12,209
Do I have that right? Is the non glow-in-the-dark?

2625
05:36:12,610 --> 05:36:25,279
What are you staying or both of those going? Okay, so it the non glow-in-the-dark is staying

2626
05:36:25,400 --> 05:36:27,319
so the one with the

2627
05:36:27,319 --> 05:36:34,790
With the ghost on it. Yeah regular ink is staying logo staying and the cards everything else is going

2628
05:36:34,790 --> 05:36:49,759
Is the glow-in-the-dark gonna be gone forever? We don't have a plan to bring it back, but I don't know

2629
05:36:50,080 --> 05:36:55,909
I don't we're just trying to get through this first period to make sure everybody gets their cards. Everybody's happy

2630
05:36:56,209 --> 05:37:15,860
That's priority number one right now. And with that we'll see you Wednesday

2631
05:37:16,259 --> 05:37:20,639
We probably won't bring it back because with the as limited as some of the stuff is

2632
05:37:21,520 --> 05:37:25,919
the cards we have inventory and

2633
05:37:26,680 --> 05:37:28,680
one inventories gone, that's

2634
05:37:29,360 --> 05:37:33,209
It's especially the starter kits. We're not doing a second print on those

2635
05:37:33,770 --> 05:37:36,779
Well, the music didn't get looped

2636
05:37:37,880 --> 05:37:45,520
Stupid and idiot loop the music next time people are counting on you to play it

2637
05:37:46,319 --> 05:37:55,310
What's my favorite color? My favorite color was the color of the pool

2638
05:37:56,470 --> 05:38:10,520
That I built and house flipper. Alright, see you guys later. See you Wednesday. Take care of yourselves. Have a great night. Call your mother

2639
05:38:11,040 --> 05:38:13,040
season
