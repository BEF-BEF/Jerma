1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:12,099
Just made it. Just barely made it. I got that window. Between 3 and 4 p.m. Pacific.

2
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:29,050
340. Last stream. 350. Stream before that. 315. 359. I'm here to do the work. Uh, back to VR.

3
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:40,950
Welcome everybody. Hope you had a good few days here. This last few days. Proud of you. Hey.

4
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:51,399
Thanks. Everybody was talking about politics and I said don't do that.

5
00:00:54,259 --> 00:01:02,179
They're right. Don't do that. Some of you may be noticing. Hold on. We'll wait. Hold on a second.

6
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:44,200
Give me a second. Hold on. You find yourself unable to cast sus because the stream is live.

7
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:58,040
But yes. Back to VR. Sure you're noticing, like I said before, uh, did somebody install

8
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:07,819
a certain add-on for Twitch? It might be something here. Let's take a look.

9
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:29,349
BTTV. I got it. And I added a peepo dance. Uh, Sticks Renegade. Thanks for the 50 bucks. And

10
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:41,460
they say hey, tax return stream. Tax return stream. Hold on. Let me see. I can't even

11
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,860
hear this. Hold on. I'm not going to be able to play this because I have my Vive audio

12
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:51,580
going through the Vive. Hold on. Can I hear it like through the Vive? Let me see if I can

13
00:02:51,580 --> 00:03:00,939
hear this through the Vive. Oh, I can. That's really low though. What the hell? That's so

14
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:16,259
strange. Yeah, let's try it again. You want to see my tax returns? All right. Remind me,

15
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:21,139
in 2019, we'll take a look at my tax returns and we'll see how much money I get paid.

16
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:31,689
It's zero. See? That's because everyone was giving me shit. I'm not going to show you

17
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:38,419
guys my fucking tax returns. That was like a jokey, funny little jokey thing about how

18
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:45,060
you're playing Octogeddon too much. Therefore, somebody had to pay you to do it. That wasn't

19
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:59,259
even true. Okay, remind me in like 2021 that I'll show you a receipt. I'll show you like a

20
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:05,590
business receipt. You can clip that if you want. All right, here we go. We're going to

21
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:13,270
start with Duck Season. I don't know what this is. I know this is like a scary game.

22
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:18,389
That's what I've been told. Why don't we like get on camera? Get that out of here.

23
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:25,189
Hey, would you look at that? There he is. He's back and he's got his workout gear. Yep.

24
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:36,060
The shirt's back. It actually feels pretty good when you have it on. We got a full 3D

25
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,750
motion here, right? Make sure you can see more than you could. Don't touch that thing,

26
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:47,269
though. Don't touch that. The whole thing will probably explode if I put my hands on that.

27
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,899
So, I'm going to get in. Hold on. Is my shit all together here?

28
00:04:53,899 --> 00:05:02,790
I think it is. Can you guys hear this? Is this sound? No. Does this have sound?

29
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:15,339
That got sound, right? Okay, yeah. Good. All right, I got the chat too. I'm ready to go in.

30
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:26,439
Just give me a minute. My head in frame. Wait a minute. Hold on. Activate the clap

31
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:32,519
emote. And then they called me the B word. Well, that should help a little bit with

32
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:46,860
the helmet. All right, let's go. I didn't even get a sip of coffee. Don't you? Okay.

33
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,699
I know I stall when I play VR, but you have to remember something. Once I go in here,

34
00:05:53,980 --> 00:06:02,920
I can't even breathe until I come out. You can't take a sip of a drink.

35
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:11,350
You can't eat anything. You can barely move. Here we go. Duck season is what we're starting

36
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:21,939
with. It's a real boomer game. I remember Duck Hunt. Yeah, I used to flash the screen.

37
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:28,060
It was fucking crazy. All right. Hold on. Where's my headset? Why does this feel tighter?

38
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:47,420
Oh shit. Oh shit. It's because Kim was playing this. I got to adjust. Not yet. Hold on.

39
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:59,290
Yes. Yes. The question. I'll answer that question for you. Sure. Yes. Me and my

40
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:05,050
girlfriend had a VR date night. I took her on a date in virtual reality. It's very expensive

41
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:13,160
to go places. It's called dinner date. You get to order the most expensive wine. You get to have

42
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,860
the most expensive food and I could just sit in the corner over there and just be like this.

43
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:25,339
Like, yeah, it's nice. And she's like, wow, hold on. Wait, you took me. You took me here.

44
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:28,220
She's looking around with like on vacation and shit. It's best bucket program you could ever

45
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:39,220
have. This is the nicest restaurant in the city. Yeah. Yes, it is. Okay. Hold on. Hey,

46
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:44,180
what do you think about that? Boyfriend of the year, right? And then I go in like for a kiss

47
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:56,379
and it's like, cause she can't see me. So it's like, oh yeah, thanks honey. I need to put these.

48
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:12,620
I can't see. I can't see anything. Come on. Is this left or right? I got to ask you guys.

49
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:28,069
I might have to put this into the camera. What a stalling asshole. I can't. I feel like

50
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:39,320
I'm looking through a microscope. Which one is this? Come on. That's left. This one's left.

51
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:54,169
This one's right. All right. I'm ready. This text is red now. Yeah. What about it? All right.

52
00:08:54,169 --> 00:09:09,779
Let's take a look at volume. That sounds a little low to me. Hold on. Where's my mouse?

53
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:27,580
I see it. I see it. I see it. I see it. I see it. Hold on. There we go. That's what

54
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:33,299
I'm talking about. That's much better. How's that sound? It's probably a little too loud.

55
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:45,500
All right. Now let's test that out. Loud. Hold on. Do you tell me better? That's probably

56
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:54,409
fine, right? That's good. That's fine. All right. Difficulty medium. Uh,

57
00:09:58,059 --> 00:10:02,649
dominant hand is the right hand. I was going to say Dalmatian. Well, light gun,

58
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:09,850
peripheral disabled, adaptive quality on. I don't know what this any of this means.

59
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:18,840
Just go new game medium. Uh, normal hunter here for the game. Okay.

60
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:29,379
Anyway, I'd have to stay in somewhere specific. Stress level zero. Life is strange.

61
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:37,289
Dibs make this game the kid that wants to be a superhero. Mom? They carry in these groceries.

62
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:51,049
Oh, you got duck season. One day rental. So make the most of it. Oh, I will.

63
00:10:51,370 --> 00:11:06,539
Well, it's kind of loud. It's loud as fuck. All right. Hold on. It's loud as fuck.

64
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:29,769
I'll take care of it. All right. Hey hunters, it's duck season. So that means we got a lot

65
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:35,210
of first time hunters out there. How to use your shotgun today. All our shotguns come

66
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:40,860
preloaded. So to start shooting, all you gotta do is aim it and pull the trigger.

67
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:45,259
Now to keep shooting. All you gotta do is place your hand on the pump of the shotgun

68
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,659
now you got another round in the chamber and you're ready to shoot.

69
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:57,960
Just like that. Now reloading your shotgun is easy. All you gotta do is put your hand up,

70
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:04,519
summon a shell from your box and put that baby into the chamber underneath the shotgun.

71
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,600
And pump it one more time and you're ready to go again.

72
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,799
Now professional hunters, they like to keep their shotgun topped off. So each time you fire

73
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:20,360
up a round and you have a second, you know, put a baby in there. Keep yourself prepared for

74
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,799
the amount of ducks that we flying at you. They'll be coming from everywhere from the left

75
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,799
to the right. They're everywhere, man. So I hope you guys learn something. And remember,

76
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:35,320
first rule of gun safety is have fun. Cause remember it's duck season.

77
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:04,539
Hey hunters, it's duck season. So that means we got a lot of first time hunters out there.

78
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:08,539
I'm going to teach you how to use your shotgun today. All our shotguns come preloaded.

79
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:16,059
All you gotta do is aim it and pull the trigger. Now to keep shooting. All you gotta do is place

80
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:21,100
your hand on the pump of the shotgun and rack that baby. Now you got another round

81
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:30,600
in the chamber and you're ready to shoot. Whoa, a banana. It's huge. What kind of

82
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:41,429
mutant world are we living in? Why are these so big? I used to have a cup like this.

83
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:59,639
All right. Stop. Okay. Just play. How do I play level one? Oh, I got a level one.

84
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:28,360
It's lagging. Is it Cox? It's not doing that on my end. Oh, it's just, really? Oh,

85
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:43,909
it's a drop of frames. Fuck. The line controllers pulled trigger. I'm not getting any like

86
00:14:43,909 --> 00:14:50,340
hardware lag. Let me just check and see how many frames I've dropped. It's never easy,

87
00:14:50,340 --> 00:15:10,460
is it? It's never easy. Okay, just play a goddamn game. Oh, shit. No, it is. Like,

88
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:24,860
what the fuck is going on here? Hold on. My CPU is going like nuts. Why? I didn't change

89
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:45,210
anything from last time. I got nothing else going on in the background here. Let

90
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:51,220
me just do one thing real quick here. No, I got like, yeah, I got like an encoding issue.

91
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:59,240
What the fuck? It's BTTV. Better twitch.tv. I'm going to have to, I might have to restart

92
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:12,409
three. Why? No, OBS had a fucking major update today. There was a major OBS update today

93
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:23,990
that I think may have caused me a problem. Fuck. Oh, I'm going to change to the other

94
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:28,360
codec. Streams going to turn off. Tell me how this works. I'll be right back.

95
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:59,269
I'll be right back. Hello? How's it look? My CPU has dropped by an insane amount.

96
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:09,420
Yeah, OBS had a pretty major update today and I just changed it to like hardware codec.

97
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:16,500
That's the first time I've had to do that in like three years. Okay, well, sorry about that.

98
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:21,799
That was weird. Didn't expect an update to do that, but let me know if it keeps going or

99
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:29,849
anything else happens. Wait, I got an opportunity to drink an iced coffee. Yeah,

100
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:43,339
I was, OBS was at like 60% CPU. Now it's at 11%. Okey dokey. Let's go. Let's actually

101
00:17:43,339 --> 00:18:16,759
play. All right. Duck season. All right. Put your hand here and then pump. Okay, just make

102
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:29,180
sure. Grab a shell. Force grab a shell. How many do I have in there? It's wicked loud.

103
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:41,319
Fucking Vive, man. I need like a tech director to play Vive. All right. Round one. Ready?

104
00:18:41,319 --> 00:19:29,529
Just lower your volume for like five minutes. This is actually really fun.

105
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:44,980
So they're gonna get, does Nintendo like get angry with them for them?

106
00:19:44,980 --> 00:20:02,970
I can see Nintendo getting angry with them. Okay, come on. I'm pretty good at these kind

107
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:29,940
of games. Throw like more than one at me. Got it. All right. Round two. Ready?

108
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,500
Actually, Nintendo's about to shut the screen down.

109
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:47,640
Lower the volume. All right. Hold on a minute here. Let me lower the fucking volume. This

110
00:20:47,720 --> 00:21:09,529
is probably like unbearable. There you go. All right. Round two. I think I'm getting

111
00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:16,390
the hang of this. See now it's horrible. Let me load the shotgun up a little bit here.

112
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:37,240
How many can fit in there? One, two, three, four, five. Okay. Bring it on. Fuck!

113
00:21:42,119 --> 00:22:05,029
It's all right. I feel like I'm playing Diner Dash. Didn't even need to look, did I?

114
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:18,170
Oh, this is fucking fun. Can I like not even do the horror movie part? Can I just do this?

115
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:34,069
A little bit. Okay. Those are the ducks that I... I thought I was getting like creepered over

116
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:48,869
here. All right. Is it loaded? I don't need to reach. You know. Make it louder. Turn around.

117
00:22:52,789 --> 00:23:31,980
What? Oh, look at me! Oh, nope. I ain't gonna do that. I ain't gonna do that one.

118
00:23:32,539 --> 00:24:11,880
Look out. Oh, look at me! I don't have to do that. I have to though. It's VR.

119
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:31,670
Two more. What do I get for ranking? That's gotta be at least like a D. Is that at least a D?

120
00:24:43,450 --> 00:25:17,059
Quickly! Quick! God damn it! Come on. Where's my mouse? Like around the back. Now I have to do

121
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:25,509
that, right? Okay. If you shot a shotgun that close to somebody's head, their hearing would be

122
00:25:25,509 --> 00:25:31,529
gone for the rest of their life. That would be like a bang. Like the whole... Everybody would

123
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:51,589
be like going like this. How's that? Turn up the volume. Turn down the volume. Turn up the

124
00:25:51,589 --> 00:26:10,869
volume. Turn down the volume. Turn up the volume. Look at me! Hey, Mom! Okay. I am against a wall.

125
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:16,150
This is fucking weird. I'm actually like sitting here like this. What wall is this?

126
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:30,180
Mom, can I have soda? Uh, duck season loading level two. Let's go.

127
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:41,140
Now it's as fucking loud as shit. Okay. Turn it up. Turn it down. Turn it up. Turn it down.

128
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:48,859
Turn it up. Turn it down. I've already watched this. Oh! That was perfect, isn't it?

129
00:26:52,420 --> 00:27:00,230
Jeremy, I think you might need to adjust the game volume. Just a little. It's so loud.

130
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:08,069
I gotta get... I can't. Alright, I'm gonna go to like the steep... No, I'm gonna go back out and...

131
00:27:16,859 --> 00:27:23,019
It's hard. Just turn your volume slider down. I usually have really quiet streams.

132
00:27:23,019 --> 00:28:01,670
Just like turn the slider down for one. The fire? Use language. Use steam menu for volume.

133
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:16,839
Everybody use hand signals to communicate with him. Oh, no. He's... Oh, no. He's wearing

134
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:29,220
iPods. He can't hear us. Right? Let's keep the stream going.

135
00:28:46,200 --> 00:29:14,809
Let me get times 10. I'll be happy. I can sense it. I can feel ultra instinct.

136
00:29:15,210 --> 00:30:01,299
Round three. Is it gonna get three ducks at the same time? Gotta keep a rhythm going.

137
00:30:02,019 --> 00:30:25,220
It's alright. It's okay. It's alright. I got it. What an absolute turret. Time's at 2 a.m.

138
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:39,720
Only 1995. Duck food? I'm not killing ducks, am I? This is just supposed to be a computer

139
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:44,170
game. This is not supposed to be real. What else we got here? Oh, thanks!

140
00:30:52,950 --> 00:31:16,710
Thanks, Mom! Did she get angry? What the fuck? I've got a frisbee. Oh, who hasn't done this yet?

141
00:31:18,019 --> 00:31:22,500
Dude, I watched a guy play duck season and I swear to God he started throwing stuff at the

142
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:56,410
mom. What? But did they hit her in the head? Spoilers. I spoiled it for myself. It's okay.

143
00:32:01,059 --> 00:32:12,710
Advanced level. Oh, fuck. He went far. Come on, give me a...

144
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:45,460
Here we go. Round one. Oh, what a bad joke. Like, I snorted the bullet and I just broke my vibe.

145
00:32:46,500 --> 00:33:19,420
Fucking idiot. Perfect. That's fine with me.

146
00:33:22,789 --> 00:34:14,730
3,333 viewers. It's a sign. That means, right? I gotta pay attention. The sun is bright.

147
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:28,139
Ah, shut up, Jeremy. Make the shots. Bad. Bad. He's bad. I'm not in the right place.

148
00:34:28,860 --> 00:35:24,619
Sign, R. Get a letter. Damn. Pretty good. Eat the shells. No, I already almost hurt myself.

149
00:35:27,619 --> 00:36:14,179
Did Jeremy already do the shoot the dog joke? Yes. What the fuck? That was pretty good.

150
00:36:15,059 --> 00:36:28,570
That's pretty good. What? I got it. What for, huh? Oh, I got it! Look!

151
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:49,929
How does it work? What? No, I want to shoot the thing. Come on, man. Oh, I can do it again.

152
00:36:49,929 --> 00:37:14,780
I can't let go of it. How do I let go? You've seen anybody do that before?

153
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:27,929
That's pretty good fan physics. Would you like this when you were a kid?

154
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:36,340
I don't know. Probably. I did it with a beat.

155
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:43,699
All right, it's going to be probably harder. I'm ready.

156
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,400
Okay, by the way, this shirt stinks like a dirty laundry basket.

157
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:23,030
I can't. It's fucking me up. It was in the laundry, I think, for too long,

158
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:28,550
and it has that dirty inside of a gym bag smell. Oh, it's fucking with me.

159
00:38:39,769 --> 00:38:46,280
Just fucking put one in. I swear to God, I'm ripping this shirt in half.

160
00:38:46,280 --> 00:39:02,539
It stinks in here. It's not me. It's the shirt. It's not me. It's not me. It's like

161
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:07,900
it was in the laundry for too long, and it didn't get dried fast enough,

162
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:12,760
and now it has that smelly. I thought somebody just like fucking hacked me.

163
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:31,960
It's filling my nostrils every time I breathe in. It's not me.

164
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:38,280
It's because I started to get some moisture going through the shirt.

165
00:39:39,079 --> 00:40:21,639
Everybody relax. Change shirt. Not yet. I deserve this. That's a pretty good tactic right there.

166
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:51,320
Let's go. Ain't going to go through the fucking tree on me. Did he? Good to go.

167
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:56,539
I'm watching in spell-o-vision, and this is unbearable. Please change shirt.

168
00:41:05,019 --> 00:41:08,780
Yeah, just go get like a piece of dirty laundry and just put it in your face.

169
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:14,230
What the hell is going on now? All right. Okay. I'm going to close my eyes,

170
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:17,510
and wherever this lands, that's exactly where I'm going to take my next vacation. Ready?

171
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:54,489
One, two, three. Can you stop? Does it stop? I don't think it stops. It doesn't stop.

172
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:09,480
That's nowhere. All right. Where am I going? That's a huge piece of pizza.

173
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:14,789
No, don't do this to me. This looks like really good. I know this is like actually

174
00:42:14,789 --> 00:42:17,590
it's kind of like a dirty laundry pizza, but I still think it looks good.

175
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:22,940
I, you can actually take a bite out of it. Fucking game of the year. What's that?

176
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:35,980
Can I like, you want to bite the whole thing? Some dogs go to hell. Where is the gra- that's

177
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:44,809
fucking creepy. This says, uh, radical racers. Look, I just got to stand still like this,

178
00:42:44,809 --> 00:42:47,690
and then I'll be able to know what direction that I, like, where the gravity is.

179
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:51,690
Okay, so gravity's going this way, so I'm standing on the wall this way.

180
00:42:51,769 --> 00:43:15,000
So I'm like, like that. Okay. Can I wake myself up? I'm in a dream.

181
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:42,280
Holy shit, he's coming to get me. Where's the wall? What do you want, the knife?

182
00:43:42,840 --> 00:44:04,039
A knife? Oh, ma. Shit, knife, right? But the throw. Don't make fun of my throw.

183
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:15,349
She's going to be like the- I'm going to have to like hide somewhere. She's

184
00:44:15,349 --> 00:44:23,130
going to turn into a fucking monster. I guarantee it. Watch some dogs go to hell.

185
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:40,010
Go. That was your warning shot. I'm going to get a perfect. I'm going to get a perfect

186
00:44:40,010 --> 00:45:06,940
or I'll shit my pants on spring. What an immature fucking thing to say. Give me a break.

187
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:26,309
Where'd you go? Oh, they disappear quickly.

188
00:45:40,519 --> 00:45:50,630
Multiple shits. Every time. Next time, we'll do it next dream, guys. I'll just drink coffee

189
00:45:50,630 --> 00:46:08,340
and eat soft cheeses. That's not appropriate for work. I can't do that. A lot of people

190
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:22,440
watch my stranger at work. Damn it. My boss heard you. That's what I'm saying. I got to

191
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:30,039
be more careful. Not applicable for work. One would say it's not safe to watch this dream

192
00:46:30,039 --> 00:46:36,969
if you're at jobs. All right, now I got to come. I got to shut up. I was doing so good.

193
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:57,769
Do it. What the fuck are you doing? I'm trying to pump the damn thing.

194
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:20,949
I'm going to cry. I'm going to cry. I'm a teacher. Please don't swear in front of my

195
00:47:20,949 --> 00:47:30,360
class. Why did you wheel a TV into the room and put my stream on? What are you teaching them

196
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:47,900
about? I guess so. I wrote this song a long time ago, but I guess they just realized

197
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,780
what it's all about. Mom just kind of walks back and forth, huh?

198
00:47:50,780 --> 00:48:27,059
Beatsaber. There's no I in Iowa. We'll be right back.

199
00:48:31,829 --> 00:48:41,559
What's that? Kazoo Kid. I kind of want to see what the Kazoo Kid is.

200
00:48:45,539 --> 00:49:21,159
Do you see what your child is watching over here? Get involved. That's about enough of

201
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:40,889
that I can take. King bit game system level six. Dogs go to hell. Oh, right. Dogs go to

202
00:49:40,889 --> 00:50:00,469
hell. I forgot about dogs go to hell. Just how many levels are in this game? I mean,

203
00:50:00,469 --> 00:50:15,369
do I have to keep showing like my extreme skill set with the light gun? Don't pay attention

204
00:50:15,369 --> 00:51:15,559
to that one. I'm not fucking around anymore. Watch this one. I just shit my pants on stream.

205
00:51:16,199 --> 00:52:05,050
What just happened? I just think this control is broken. Here we go. I'm ready. Now you

206
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:10,980
motherfucker. I gotta like move. I think I'm not getting picked up by the sensor.

207
00:52:11,539 --> 00:52:41,530
I should have got a triple right there too. I know like the kids right there. Check your

208
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:53,420
six. Tonight channels. All right. Where's uh, where's dogs go to hell? Watch that one next.

209
00:52:54,139 --> 00:53:21,260
I mean, that's unbelievable. This is an ode to G mod. I don't want to watch that.

210
00:53:23,079 --> 00:53:32,150
Time buddies. No, where's dogs go to hell? Treasure hunters. I don't know which one is

211
00:53:32,150 --> 00:54:04,579
this? Right? Right? Right? Everybody funny, right? It's gonna take off. It's gonna fly away.

212
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:20,300
I just realized the Travelocity gnome just started to tap into like the young millennial

213
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:29,739
audience, right? Didn't even need to do anything. The Travelocity gnome just has to exist

214
00:54:29,739 --> 00:54:48,360
and he'll be like hip still. They make a Travelocity commercial where he like pops up

215
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:52,889
on the screen and just goes like, Oh, all of you guys would fucking buy that insurance.

216
00:54:53,530 --> 00:55:04,940
Right. Wait. No, you'd whatever it is. No, that's kind of okay. What about these other games here?

217
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:19,349
Hold on. This is duck season. What's this one? Whaling 1842. Do I have to play this?

218
00:55:24,760 --> 00:56:02,550
Jesus. Oh my God. I think I lost. What are the other games? The whales win.

219
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:36,420
Triple Tiger. Triple Tiger. This is a shooting game. Okay. Um, I don't know. That's not

220
00:56:36,739 --> 00:56:58,309
like a Pokemon scenario there. Remember your training. I have a gun. You go for a punch.

221
00:56:58,309 --> 00:57:09,019
Oops. Go for a high kick. Gotta go for a punch. Low kick. Gotta go for a high punch.

222
00:57:09,019 --> 00:57:30,949
I don't understand. It's like rock, paper, scissors. Battle. Oh, the Super Mario Brothers.

223
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:50,679
That's like Tropical Fruit Mario Brothers. It's just Flappy Bird. All right. Hold on.

224
00:57:50,679 --> 00:58:33,510
Let me try this one again. It's just Flappy Bird. No. There's a lot of random games here, huh?

225
00:58:38,039 --> 00:59:01,239
Desert Boss. Behind you. What? Mom, Mom, are you eating a pizza sandwich? That's a slice of

226
00:59:01,239 --> 00:59:14,579
pizza on top of face down on a slice of pizza. What's wrong with you? I gotta wait. Where's

227
00:59:14,579 --> 00:59:22,059
my, where'd it go? It just went into the machine. It just sucked in. See, look, Mom

228
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:26,059
took one of these, flipped it this way and put another one underneath that is eating that.

229
00:59:27,659 --> 00:59:36,780
I've never, I actually want to do that. I'm going to try that. Okay. Uh, what happened to,

230
00:59:38,329 --> 00:59:42,730
no, I don't want to play that stupid game. Okay. Somebody says blowing it.

231
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:59,190
I didn't do anything. There's a microphone up here. I don't know if it's like,

232
00:59:59,190 --> 01:00:15,110
could have thought I was doing something. Get that out. Try harder. It's not going to,

233
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:27,820
no, I'm not fucking humoring you guys. That's not real. Pizza Boy. Wasn't there,

234
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:39,510
I was supposed to play another game. Hold on. How do you play Pizza Boy? How do you throw a

235
01:00:39,510 --> 01:01:01,289
pizza? Is it like throw pizza? Oops. I don't know how to throw a pizza. Oh, I just like

236
01:01:01,289 --> 01:01:18,170
killed that guy. Oopsie daisy. Just pulling a guy over. Sir, you know, I pulled you over.

237
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:23,960
I don't know. Is it, is it the 15 to 20 pizzas I've thrown up my driver's side window?

238
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:36,090
All right. That's it. What's that one? Hover junkers. What's this one? I gotta play Sinatra first.

239
01:01:36,889 --> 01:02:00,219
Fucking weird lady. I don't get it. This one's actually kind of fun. Oops.

240
01:02:06,099 --> 01:02:09,849
What's this one? You know what's really funny about this? This is like,

241
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:15,769
this is what we did three days ago. This is just me with like a dream cast or like a

242
01:02:15,769 --> 01:02:20,570
PlayStation 2 or the PlayStation 1. What's the next one? What's up? I died once.

243
01:02:27,320 --> 01:03:13,139
Yeah, guys, this was like $485. Did I lose? How do I reload? That was pretty good, man.

244
01:03:13,139 --> 01:03:19,909
That was like 48 bucks. All right, let's go back to the real game. No, dogs go to hell.

245
01:03:19,909 --> 01:03:35,940
Let's see what this one is like. That one's not safe for work. What's wrong with it?

246
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:56,420
I tried. I have no idea. All right. Back in the game. Let's get back into it.

247
01:04:02,739 --> 01:04:10,380
Hey, dog. I haven't played in so long. I think I lost my muscle memory of how to play this game.

248
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:30,789
I gotta get the better spot. Yeah, it's the spot. It's doing it like this right there.

249
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:57,239
Got four coming out at the same time now. I got an issue here. I got like a wardrobe

250
01:04:57,239 --> 01:05:01,719
malfunction here. This like is going to come down and like rip off all my clothes.

251
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:55,579
Reloaded. Last round.

252
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:45,980
Got wiggly at the end there. I should be looking behind me. Shoot the sun.

253
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:51,110
Am I like stuck in an infinite loop? No, it's like six months. That's my bedtime.

254
01:07:12,329 --> 01:07:30,570
How much are the wiggles? What the? Oh, it's that guy.

255
01:07:36,539 --> 01:07:49,420
Wow, there's a guy over there. He was stalling because he was scared.

256
01:07:49,420 --> 01:08:00,250
You can call it whatever the heck you want. Check this in training. What's that? What's that?

257
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:04,730
An intruder onto my right. That kid is going to play calm. I'm dancing to the fucking wiggles.

258
01:08:05,449 --> 01:08:13,300
They all get different colored shirts on. Bang. That would just hit him right in the

259
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:22,199
fucking nose. I would break his nose up into his head. I'll show you again. Bang.

260
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:32,539
He'd fucking puke and that would sprint over in fucking one, two, three uppercut.

261
01:08:32,779 --> 01:08:49,460
What would fucking happen? What a gamer. I gotta get like the hand. I gotta keep the hand down.

262
01:08:50,579 --> 01:09:32,140
That works too, doesn't it? Beautiful. All right. Not bad. Not terrible. Not good,

263
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:48,859
but not bad. But pretty good. I thought he was going to be quicker than that. Slow than that,

264
01:09:48,859 --> 01:10:21,109
I mean. Come on, man. I had it. Sometimes you just, you see how my hand comes down?

265
01:10:50,069 --> 01:11:28,229
Come on, do it. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Whoa. You're in the room. What happened? What happened?

266
01:11:28,229 --> 01:11:40,859
Oh shit. Oh no. Now that's, now that's, that's something bad happened there.

267
01:12:02,539 --> 01:12:33,689
Well, mom's, mom's seen better days. Come on. Got it. Okay. Oh, pizza. Double pizza.

268
01:12:33,689 --> 01:12:56,380
See? What a, that's a genius fucking thing. Last meal. All right. Come face me. Anything else

269
01:12:56,380 --> 01:13:15,850
I should be looking at here? Don't let the TV break. Well, what do you mean don't let the

270
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:28,810
TV break? That TV? I'm not ready. I'm not ready. I'm not ready. Ready? Shoot the moon.

271
01:13:28,810 --> 01:14:06,250
Oh, he's throwing fucking bombs. Fuck. How did I miss? All right. That was just bullshit.

272
01:14:06,250 --> 01:15:05,500
You saw that. Cock the gun. Cock the gun. Why does it not do it? What do I shoot him? In the

273
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:57,989
fucking eyes? My god. Oh my. Oh, it's making me mad. Oh, let me shoot the gun. Look at

274
01:15:58,229 --> 01:16:36,489
it. Like, no, I want to fight him again. Give me like a fucking shock and then they're like

275
01:16:36,489 --> 01:17:18,310
screws in it. Seven endings in this game. Stuck forever. I'm you. That was fun. Whoa,

276
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:26,020
don't do that to me. That was fucking weird. Uh, what does continue do? Can I start? Could I

277
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:33,479
do it again? I'm going to kill this guy. That will make me throw up though. All right.

278
01:17:33,479 --> 01:17:38,140
Yeah. Let's go. Let's go. Let's do it again. I'm ready. Come face me. Let's go.

279
01:17:38,619 --> 01:18:09,659
Let's get the good end. Ah, fuck you. Freddy Fazbear asshole. Let's go. All right. Let's

280
01:18:09,659 --> 01:19:23,350
like do it. Well, that was bullshit. Play with the trombone to reload this shotgun.

281
01:19:23,350 --> 01:20:44,359
Yay. Just wait a minute. Hold on. That ain't going to be it. Ow. Did I escape the video

282
01:20:44,359 --> 01:21:02,260
game? Midnight. Is there more? Oh god. Mom's still dead back there. What? I thought I

283
01:21:02,260 --> 01:21:13,159
would correct it though. Oh my god. He's here. Where is he? Where is this motherfucker?

284
01:21:27,819 --> 01:21:48,789
Does anybody know where he is? He was right there and like right here. What the fuck?

285
01:21:54,489 --> 01:22:25,779
Stay in there. We're good. I think I did it. Midnight. Oh, like stomped on the game.

286
01:22:28,899 --> 01:22:29,779
I called the police.

287
01:22:29,779 --> 01:22:51,479
Hello? It's my, it's my mom. Why is mom dead? Why would mom be dead here? We're going

288
01:22:51,479 --> 01:23:16,250
to bury mom? What the fuck? Uh, okay. This is not just a good ending. This is a bad

289
01:23:16,329 --> 01:23:43,300
ending too. What? Duck season. So is there an ending where mom lives? That was a little

290
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:51,529
out of control. It was a fun game though. Nice job, Alex. Nice job, Brandon. Nice job,

291
01:23:51,529 --> 01:23:59,060
Cameron. Nice job, Kevin. Nice job, Jeremy. Tiffany. Nate. Nate. Chris. Michael. Spencer.

292
01:23:59,060 --> 01:24:05,800
Spencer again. Two different Spencers in this company. Chapman. Tyler. Heldine. And of course,

293
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:09,800
we could forget Jake Watson. He's the one that kept it all together. He's the fucking lawyer.

294
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:27,699
Oh, I'm so glad that the Nickelodeon snick couch is behind me. That's, that's only 90s

295
01:24:27,699 --> 01:24:38,039
boomers will know what that is. Well, there we go. All right. That's cool. That was fun.

296
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:44,390
That was a nice little experience. Shooting was fun. Let me come out for a second.

297
01:24:44,470 --> 01:25:03,340
Oh yeah. Save mom. I, no, I can't. I'm not going to do that. There's five more endings

298
01:25:03,979 --> 01:25:10,069
and you can get them when you play for the vibe in Oculus Rift. Do a pee break. Yeah,

299
01:25:10,069 --> 01:25:12,949
I'm going to take a break for a minute. It's going to take a piss and just kind of throw

300
01:25:12,949 --> 01:25:18,760
some water in my face. And then we come back. I got all this flot. Uh, there is,

301
01:25:20,229 --> 01:25:23,270
like I could, I could start. I don't think I want to start a mind show yet

302
01:25:23,270 --> 01:25:28,409
because if I start mine show, then I'm probably not going to get out of that for a while.

303
01:25:29,130 --> 01:25:37,819
So, uh, there is, I'm not playing that right now. I'll come back. We'll figure it out.

304
01:25:37,819 --> 01:25:46,390
I have like the Creed boxing game. I've got disassembly VR. I've got a horror game. I've got

305
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:50,439
jet Island. I've got another Island. I'm going to, I think it might come back and

306
01:25:50,439 --> 01:25:58,539
do the dinosaur Island one. We'll find out. I got lots to do. I'll be right back.

307
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:03,340
Hold on. Let me just slowly put this down. Okay. See you guys. And did you just hear that like,

308
01:26:03,899 --> 01:26:08,630
I made like a weird like cat noise at my throat. Uh, I'll be back in like two,

309
01:26:08,630 --> 01:29:00,649
three minutes. Just going to take a quick little break. All right.

310
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:04,569
So I think I'm going to play the dinosaur Island game.

311
01:29:05,770 --> 01:29:16,090
This is Island three 59. It's a game where you land on an Island and have to fight

312
01:29:16,090 --> 01:29:34,260
dinosaurs. It's kind of right up my alley. Move this. All right. Uh, dinosaur four 20. No,

313
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:44,619
I need to change the game title. I don't think this is Island three. I don't know. This ain't

314
01:29:44,619 --> 01:29:55,590
even on Twitch directory. No, yes, there it is. All right, let's go. Thank you for your

315
01:29:55,590 --> 01:30:24,869
patience. Let's open Island three 59. I got to move. All right. We tangled. No, this

316
01:30:24,869 --> 01:30:28,630
actually is not tangled tonight. I really have to move around too much in the last one. So

317
01:30:30,069 --> 01:30:54,569
let's go ahead and bring this back. Instruction stand upright. Okay. I got to like do my height.

318
01:30:55,770 --> 01:31:02,890
Get it out of your system. Now. All right. Get it out of your system. I will allow at least

319
01:31:03,529 --> 01:31:15,479
25 seconds of height joke spam and then that's it. You got 20 seconds.

320
01:31:21,899 --> 01:31:35,399
Virtual self. Where is this one? This is lying to me where this control is not over here.

321
01:31:35,399 --> 01:31:45,670
It's over here. Okay. Stand upright. Make sure a floor height is accurate.

322
01:31:46,550 --> 01:31:56,119
Okay. Using virtual self. Virtual self is in beta. Step into boots. Step into boots.

323
01:31:57,420 --> 01:32:07,420
Click create new profile and then use the sliders. I fucked it up again. I'm going to

324
01:32:07,420 --> 01:32:16,920
put like tape on this shit. So I know. All right. So we can step into the boots.

325
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:38,460
Am I in the boots? Does this count? Okay. Arm length. I got to make me shoulders forward

326
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:49,159
and back. This looks really strange. No, my chest is kind of like that does not look

327
01:32:49,159 --> 01:33:06,090
correct. Like an earthworm person. No, that's not, I'm not even on the ground.

328
01:33:08,569 --> 01:33:19,779
I have to at least be like on the ground. All right. That looks okay.

329
01:33:21,079 --> 01:33:33,510
Characters. There's different characters. I'm just going to read this guy. Warning

330
01:33:33,510 --> 01:33:45,300
impacts. Add spectator camera. What the name of God is that? What is that?

331
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:59,930
So I can add like my own president evil camera. Can you guys even,

332
01:34:00,970 --> 01:34:14,630
how do you let anybody see that? Can you guys see this? No, why am I doing that? You're

333
01:34:14,630 --> 01:34:27,020
in my arm. Yeah, but like that doesn't, this is not going to do anything.

334
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:43,020
Use the window capture instead of open VR. Yeah, that's going to run like shit though.

335
01:34:43,020 --> 01:35:04,899
Now we're going without it. Jesus. Ready to start? You betcha. Let's talk about you

336
01:35:05,539 --> 01:35:13,430
and your life. He's got a gamer in there.

337
01:35:22,810 --> 01:35:29,800
Pick up that bucket. Oh, it is like a pew, right?

338
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:45,319
Both buckets of face. Oh, just look at the ground. The basics. It was a comfortable

339
01:35:45,319 --> 01:35:48,310
movement method.

340
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:21,960
Oh, I'm going to say teleport track pad. How would you choose how you'd like to aim?

341
01:36:24,180 --> 01:36:43,739
Look, look, get to the wave. No, go back. Go back. Go back. Did I?

342
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:59,420
Hold on. Didn't I turn off? How do I open the menu for this game?

343
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:27,779
The in-game menu. Yeah. Sorry guys. Movement mode. Teleport. Okay. Thank you.

344
01:37:30,409 --> 01:37:33,529
Yo, that's so much easier. I'm not going to die now.

345
01:37:48,390 --> 01:37:50,710
So press menu to drop on the X.

346
01:37:59,739 --> 01:38:03,109
Hold the grip. Let's pick a backpack up.

347
01:38:12,729 --> 01:38:18,779
Okay. All right.

348
01:38:25,859 --> 01:38:40,420
It's not going to kill us, right? Wait, give him a knife. Yeah.

349
01:38:40,979 --> 01:38:57,109
What the fuck?

350
01:39:01,779 --> 01:39:15,899
Climb up the ladder. You got it. There. Wait, what is that? Why is there a secret like

351
01:39:15,899 --> 01:39:35,750
Alice in Wonderland door? Oh, this is from the helicopter. Reach out and grab a run.

352
01:39:35,750 --> 01:40:00,939
Oh, that's not even you sprint to enter tower.

353
01:40:10,180 --> 01:40:28,470
Bucking for you. Lucky for you. Double agent.

354
01:40:33,109 --> 01:40:35,670
You should be in the clear. I can't shoot the sky.

355
01:40:39,939 --> 01:40:44,180
That's a good idea. This is the absolute worst way we could be having this conversation.

356
01:40:45,479 --> 01:40:56,569
Oh, the kids, the kids doing good. All right. It doesn't, it's fine. It doesn't work.

357
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:17,109
Aim movement at ladder to exit. All right. Fall like a nose.

358
01:41:20,229 --> 01:41:26,810
Restricted area warning. All right. We're looking for what? We're looking for dinosaurs.

359
01:41:27,689 --> 01:42:09,930
I didn't mean to do that. Get to the thing. What? One, two, three. All right. Oh, you're too close.

360
01:42:11,529 --> 01:42:19,220
What's in here? Oh, more of this.

361
01:42:24,699 --> 01:42:27,659
Hold down grip with gun hand until ammo selector appears.

362
01:42:40,409 --> 01:42:50,649
All right. That's odd, but fine. Thanks a lot. I don't know what this guy's name is.

363
01:42:52,630 --> 01:43:31,239
Kill the raptors. When did they attack? Thank you. That was kind of lame. It's all right though.

364
01:43:44,550 --> 01:43:54,649
All right. You got a leopardette. Pills? What is this leopardette?

365
01:44:00,470 --> 01:44:03,510
That was scary. I thought that was a tree.

366
01:44:03,510 --> 01:44:29,100
I thought it was a tree and it started moving. Grab everything. That's cool. Up into the house.

367
01:44:35,829 --> 01:45:06,659
What kind of door? It's a push door. Really? Move upgrade to highlighted area on guns. Laser

368
01:45:06,659 --> 01:45:23,189
sight. What was that? How do I get to the gate? Can I sneak out this way? Yep. Come on. I

369
01:45:23,189 --> 01:45:47,979
can't do that. Shit. Where? Kill the stegosaur. Where's there a stegosaur?

370
01:46:04,439 --> 01:46:27,529
Where? Okay. I want to see a clip of that. I want to see how stupid I actually am. There's

371
01:46:27,529 --> 01:46:55,939
no stegosaur. I'm a fucking idiot. I could hear him, but he wasn't on the screen.

372
01:46:56,500 --> 01:47:23,159
All right. T-Rex is going to show up right here. All right. Let's go. Island 359.

373
01:47:24,039 --> 01:47:35,270
So what do you do? What are you supposed to do in this game? Update 1.0. Survival mode exists now.

374
01:47:35,270 --> 01:47:43,529
What is over here? Mercenary store. Cash in merc credits for gear. Sell found gear for credits.

375
01:47:47,939 --> 01:47:58,439
Okay. That's pretty cool. Let me get this shit on. All right. See you later. Good luck.

376
01:48:02,819 --> 01:48:08,090
Survival mode? Which one? What do you want me to do? Sell your knife and gum.

377
01:48:13,819 --> 01:48:19,260
Survival. A carefully paced survival experience. Traverse the open island.

378
01:48:19,260 --> 01:48:24,300
Discover survivor stories. Explore camp, scrounge, loot, kill, and survive. Okay.

379
01:48:25,420 --> 01:48:40,819
I'll give it a try. I'm going to throw up for this. Do I get a different gun? Same gun?

380
01:48:50,949 --> 01:49:01,579
Yeah. Yeah. Give me that. I'm not doing that again. I'm going to wear the bucket. I just

381
01:49:01,579 --> 01:49:19,079
want to land. Oh, that kind of hurts. That's a great feature. I don't even know what I'm looking

382
01:49:19,079 --> 01:49:33,510
at. Am I crazy? Does that look strange? My hand is fucked up. That's all right.

383
01:49:34,310 --> 01:49:42,619
I feel like I'm looking at the world through some strange filter.

384
01:49:43,340 --> 01:49:46,489
What do I have to do? Eat berries or something? Eat weeds?

385
01:49:49,100 --> 01:49:58,550
All right. I hear something. I don't have any bullets in this guy. Get out of here.

386
01:50:18,020 --> 01:50:27,909
Stick it back on like a kebab. Is there an alarm on you? What the? Oh, this is on my hunger meter?

387
01:50:28,710 --> 01:50:43,500
Okay. I'm just going to find the bed. That's just a JPEG. That's not going to do anything

388
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:52,279
for me. What about over here? Up in the top? No, there's a building right here.

389
01:50:53,079 --> 01:51:07,050
There we go. Health. What about food? Do I need anything? What's this? Potato chips?

390
01:51:10,939 --> 01:51:25,590
Okay. No. Give me the knife back. There's something in here. There's a crate here.

391
01:51:29,829 --> 01:51:32,520
I don't think I can do anything with it. Can I not do something with this?

392
01:51:33,159 --> 01:51:49,369
This is like a weapon crate. Should I go in the outhouse? This is just an open world.

393
01:51:49,930 --> 01:52:12,939
Let's climb up. Pretty good vantage point though. A crowbar? I don't think I can pick

394
01:52:12,939 --> 01:52:28,659
that up. Yeah, I can. Nice. I'm bashing. Somebody's heading with this thing. Okay.

395
01:52:30,729 --> 01:52:38,810
Check the yellow one. This is not a rhinoceros. What are those things? Triceratops.

396
01:52:40,779 --> 01:53:04,600
Are Triceratops friendly? Will he run after me? I don't even know where he is.

397
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:17,029
Oh my God. He's freaking out. He's like a dog with the zoomies. He's a dog that just had a

398
01:53:17,029 --> 01:53:44,659
bath. What is it? Shit. That was so mean. Did he tire himself out? He killed that dog. I

399
01:53:44,659 --> 01:54:32,359
didn't kill anything. Come here you motherfucker. Oh, he hit me. He's hitting me. All right. I

400
01:54:32,359 --> 01:54:43,109
have to get out of this. I'm gonna die. Have fun. Goodbye. I'm getting killed over this.

401
01:54:43,109 --> 01:55:01,109
I'm already like dead. He's just stuck down there in that ditch. He's still there? That's

402
01:55:01,109 --> 01:55:04,550
so terrifying that they move so erratically like that. If you come across a huge...

403
01:55:06,619 --> 01:55:15,539
Where was it? Where did I want to go? Is that him? I'm just gonna go this way.

404
01:55:27,079 --> 01:55:47,659
How do I eat? Oh shit. I'm almost dead. What's up there? Okay. Fizz. I don't know

405
01:55:47,659 --> 01:55:55,140
what that thing is. Do I have to eat the dinosaurs? Is that how this works?

406
01:55:56,569 --> 01:56:01,140
He's not threatening, right? They're not that threatening. That's one of the

407
01:56:01,140 --> 01:56:18,100
velociraptors. That's like some of the weird dinosaur. It looks kind of mean though. I'm

408
01:56:18,100 --> 01:56:45,189
not gonna fuck with that. It's an elephant. It's an elephant. Run. Why is it an elephant?

409
01:56:46,229 --> 01:57:05,340
Run away. Oh, that's unbelievable. Is that what that dinosaur actually sounded like?

410
01:57:06,140 --> 01:57:28,010
Get out of here. Hey, you want something? Here. I think I ate it. He's running again.

411
01:57:34,840 --> 01:57:52,779
I don't know. He's still chasing me with his tuba. Oh, come on. Why is he still here?

412
01:57:53,739 --> 01:58:09,020
I don't know how to get away from him. I got dirt in the head. I was so called for.

413
01:58:11,930 --> 01:58:29,779
I just spit on myself. He's still chasing me. Why? Aren't you out of breath at this point?

414
01:58:32,180 --> 01:58:43,819
He's gonna kill over and die from exhaustion. There's a car. Can I get in the car?

415
01:58:48,420 --> 01:58:50,899
Get on top of the car. All right. I'm on top of the car. He can't get me.

416
01:59:09,939 --> 01:59:15,500
You bastard. Get away from me. Leave. Leave me alone.

417
01:59:15,500 --> 01:59:31,640
This is the stupidest thing. He followed me for like 12 blocks.

418
01:59:43,699 --> 01:59:49,539
That was too much. I swear to God, if I get off this and he's right there,

419
01:59:49,539 --> 01:59:55,859
I'm gonna fucking pee my pants. Okay. Are we good? I'm gonna open this door.

420
02:00:03,180 --> 02:00:04,699
How do I open this?

421
02:00:04,699 --> 02:00:23,430
There's nothing even in here. There's just mold. I can't get over that. That was stupid.

422
02:00:24,069 --> 02:00:32,920
Okay. Let's keep going. I need to... I'm gonna die. The whole world is red right now because

423
02:00:32,920 --> 02:01:01,430
I'm one head away from death. Oh shit. Does he have a camera? He's videotaping like a

424
02:01:01,430 --> 02:01:08,170
skateboard video. Look at that. Watch. A fucking velociraptor is gonna do like an

425
02:01:08,170 --> 02:01:27,899
ollie right here and go over him. I think he's too far away. Yeah. He's recovering.

426
02:01:27,899 --> 02:01:44,739
He's thinking about what he did. Is that like a base I can ransack or something?

427
02:01:56,760 --> 02:02:00,359
I don't like how open this looks. This is a big open field. I don't like it at all.

428
02:02:01,079 --> 02:02:09,699
I also don't like what's going on here on the skyline. It hurts my head.

429
02:02:10,500 --> 02:02:30,920
Am I at the edge of the world? I'm so lost.

430
02:02:37,100 --> 02:02:38,619
Is it that? I would have...

431
02:02:49,109 --> 02:02:55,960
There's something right here. What is it? It's a stegosaurus.

432
02:02:59,979 --> 02:03:17,260
Don't like run around in a circle like a dog. I can't get on top of this rock, can I?

433
02:03:17,260 --> 02:03:34,779
Okay. I'm on the rock. I think I'm safe. Base. How do I get by you to get down there?

434
02:03:34,779 --> 02:03:49,479
Wrap all the way around. He's just waiting for me to move. He's just got his eyes on me.

435
02:03:50,119 --> 02:03:54,840
I didn't know stegosaurus was that fast. I thought they were slow lumbering animals.

436
02:04:08,140 --> 02:04:21,779
Okay, we're good. Ammo. Give me something. The base is right down here.

437
02:04:21,779 --> 02:04:29,079
There's air conditioning here. That's electricity.

438
02:04:35,829 --> 02:04:55,130
What is that? Punch it? It's not gonna work. Is there like a front door? Here it is.

439
02:04:55,130 --> 02:05:07,449
How do I open this? There's a big on button. That would work, wouldn't it?

440
02:05:08,090 --> 02:05:22,729
Eureka! Give me something to eat or scavenge or something. I got AC over here.

441
02:05:23,369 --> 02:05:37,079
Let's go in the building. Find story note to unlock. What is this? Slenderman?

442
02:05:37,880 --> 02:05:57,989
Let me find story note. Bullets know nothing? Oh god damn it. Come on. What? Tent? It's getting

443
02:05:57,989 --> 02:06:05,100
dark out. I can't even go in this tent. Anything in the dumpster?

444
02:06:26,090 --> 02:06:30,810
Uh, okay. I'm supposed to be picking up sticks. I gotta get another note.

445
02:06:31,850 --> 02:06:45,210
It's getting too dark. Resident sleeper. Crafting game. Look, let me just...

446
02:06:52,060 --> 02:07:03,829
Next game. Hold on. Give me one second. It showed its true nature. It's a crafting game.

447
02:07:10,810 --> 02:07:28,060
Huh, okay. Just play mercenary mode. That's true. We should probably... Wow, that's

448
02:07:28,060 --> 02:07:35,350
main menu. Let's do mercenary mode. Let's see how it is. That's like putting sticks

449
02:07:35,350 --> 02:07:51,289
together and making fires. I don't wanna do that. Mercenary mode. Move freely,

450
02:07:51,289 --> 02:07:57,210
explore, hunt, kill, or be killed. We'll go to the beach. Loot drop. Big hunt. Loot drops.

451
02:07:57,210 --> 02:08:09,640
Big hunt. Big hunt. Difficulty normal. Let's go. We'll move on after this.

452
02:08:12,779 --> 02:08:29,529
I'm not even gonna give it a second. Wait, wait. No, no. No, no. Give me that.

453
02:08:29,609 --> 02:08:53,340
Ah, come on. What was that? What was that? Go to the waypoint. Okay.

454
02:08:59,029 --> 02:09:16,260
How do I give it a gun? Can't grab arrow with gun. Well, how do I let go of this? Okay,

455
02:09:16,260 --> 02:09:24,710
arrows. Where are the arrows? Where are the arrows? What the fuck is this?

456
02:09:28,619 --> 02:09:46,819
What is that? What is this? Where are the arrows? It says can't grab arrows with gun. Why not?

457
02:10:02,579 --> 02:10:31,859
Oh, no. I want the backpack. I want the backpack. That's pretty fucking sick. All right,

458
02:10:31,859 --> 02:10:50,069
let's go. I think I have infinity of these. Let's go. I don't put the knife away. All right,

459
02:10:50,069 --> 02:12:09,159
hide. Wait, we point right in the neck, right? Wait! One more time. One more time.

460
02:12:09,159 --> 02:12:27,420
One more time. Okay, let's go. No, I don't want that. Let's just, I'm gonna kill this thing.

461
02:12:28,859 --> 02:12:37,640
I don't even need, I don't give a shit about anything else. Let's go. I'd like some radio

462
02:12:37,640 --> 02:13:32,970
metal. What? Jesus Christ. Please just let me do it. Ah! Okay, moving on. This game's

463
02:13:32,970 --> 02:13:41,100
actually pretty cool. This game's pretty cool. It is. It's a pretty cool game. I'll tell you.

464
02:13:44,010 --> 02:13:56,180
All right, next up is Apollo Creed, the boxing game. This game makes me angry. Wait, why?

465
02:13:57,220 --> 02:14:22,789
How the fuck did I end up over here? Give me one sec. I'm the bad guy. You look sad.

466
02:14:24,470 --> 02:14:41,300
Sad? All right, you want to do horror? I do have a horror game. All right, we'll try this

467
02:14:41,300 --> 02:15:00,100
horror game that I got. Let me close out of this. All right, how do I get out of this? Quick. Okay.

468
02:15:03,819 --> 02:15:09,260
The game I have is called Dreadhalls. It looked like people thought it was fun. It looked like

469
02:15:09,260 --> 02:15:30,100
it was pretty highly rated. Let's give it a try. Yeah, Dreadhalls. Not that one. What's

470
02:15:30,100 --> 02:15:48,300
wrong with that one? Okay, launch Dreadhalls in Steam VR mode. That's the one I want to do.

471
02:15:48,300 --> 02:16:09,420
All right, let's just do it. All right, I need to change the game to Dreadhalls.

472
02:16:09,420 --> 02:16:29,430
Is this game going to actually cause me a problem? Well, as long as I don't throw up, I don't care.

473
02:16:30,979 --> 02:16:40,739
And turn the lights off. Why does that matter? Turn the lights off? I'm in here. Why do I

474
02:16:40,739 --> 02:17:01,430
need to turn the lights off? Turn the lights off. Hold on. Why would you want me to do this?

475
02:17:02,309 --> 02:17:15,770
I can't even, why can I not control my lights? I'm not connected? Unable to connect

476
02:17:17,690 --> 02:17:39,739
to my Phillips Hue? Why? There we go. Is that better? All right, see you guys on there.

477
02:17:42,139 --> 02:17:49,850
By the way, if you want to know the plan on Saturday, I'm pretty sure me and Star are

478
02:17:49,850 --> 02:18:00,899
going to do some co-op VR games. So that should be a lot of fun. We're going to try

479
02:18:00,899 --> 02:18:13,780
like Wreck Room, a couple of the multiplayer games, see how they are. Ow, my hair. I got

480
02:18:13,780 --> 02:18:20,020
to prepare for this. I hate this shit. God damn, like horror games and I got to put both headphones

481
02:18:20,020 --> 02:18:43,079
in. Hey, get ready for some fake reactions. Yeah, that's right. It's tuber time. Let me

482
02:18:43,079 --> 02:18:58,709
give you a good thumbnail first though. Let me get you a good thumbnail. Is that good? Both

483
02:18:58,709 --> 02:19:11,540
these have to go in. God damn it. I'm doing both. I'm doing both. It's a horror game. I'm

484
02:19:11,540 --> 02:19:32,420
going to do both. All right. Here we go. Just don't ever have hair. Just get rid of it.

485
02:19:33,239 --> 02:19:40,459
It just gets in the way. It's just dead. Why even have it? It's just fingernails. You

486
02:19:40,459 --> 02:19:44,920
know that your hair is just your fingernails, but finer. We cut our fingernails. Just get

487
02:19:44,920 --> 02:19:51,799
rid of them. We're going to evil off our fingernails off anyways. All right. I'm ready.

488
02:19:53,290 --> 02:20:01,700
No, I'm not. I am. Okay. That was, I was just puked. I was just like refluxed.

489
02:20:02,340 --> 02:20:19,000
Fucking stalling. I know I'm stalling. All right. Options. Audio setting. Five hands.

490
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:31,799
Right-handed. Keep the tutorial on. How are we doing on audio? We good? How's that?

491
02:20:32,680 --> 02:20:39,510
Pretty good. Video settings should be fine. Quality good. Anti-aliasing. That's whatever.

492
02:20:40,469 --> 02:20:46,870
Moving settings. Rotation speed. Snap comfort. Move in looking direction. Press trackpad to

493
02:20:46,870 --> 02:20:57,959
move. I think that's fine. Well, here you go, motherfuckers. This is what you wanted.

494
02:20:59,319 --> 02:21:02,920
Content warning. This game is an intense horror experience featuring scenes of disturbing

495
02:21:02,920 --> 02:21:17,860
nature. Player discretion is advised. Inventory move light. Interactive open sprint map look.

496
02:21:18,100 --> 02:21:25,299
So I move around with this. I look with this. That's inventory. This is map. Interactive light

497
02:21:25,299 --> 02:21:47,579
and sprint. Point with your right hand and press trigger to pick up. A bottle of oil.

498
02:21:47,579 --> 02:21:56,100
You can use it to fuel your lamp. Right trigger to collect. Oh, I have a lamp. This

499
02:21:56,100 --> 02:22:11,139
is just VR amnesia. You actually have to walk around. What the fuck is this thing?

500
02:22:11,139 --> 02:22:16,790
What the fuck is this thing? Handwritten note. I can't wait for you. Not anymore. Not here.

501
02:22:16,790 --> 02:22:22,709
There's an exit. The stone face told me. I'll be there. I'll wait for you there.

502
02:22:22,709 --> 02:22:33,799
Follow my trail. Find the eyes. Find the exit. Hold right hand. Trigger and turn hand

503
02:22:33,799 --> 02:23:25,379
left and right. Okay. So does that drive a weapon? Two coins? You can always brute force

504
02:23:25,379 --> 02:23:29,459
locks. But using these lock picks should be faster. Right trigger to collect them.

505
02:23:29,459 --> 02:23:33,450
What about these coins? A coin from the past. Right trigger to collect it.

506
02:23:34,569 --> 02:23:56,600
What do you do with the coins though? Haunted house games.

507
02:24:11,850 --> 02:24:23,899
Try to close this behind me. Close. Get this thing closed. How can I tell

508
02:24:23,899 --> 02:24:28,459
how much oil is in the tank here? Use the oil in your inventory to fuel your lamp.

509
02:24:29,260 --> 02:24:38,819
So that's the inventory. What the hell was that noise? Grab the lamp oil.

510
02:24:38,819 --> 02:24:56,139
Okay. That makes it brighter. I have a couple more lock picks. When do I get machete?

511
02:24:56,139 --> 02:25:23,940
Open the inventory and grab a lock pick. Place the lock pick here and then release.

512
02:25:23,940 --> 02:25:35,190
So it opens it instantly. Coins. No! That was important information. How do I look at that

513
02:25:35,190 --> 02:25:38,549
again? Where's that? How do I look at that again? That was probably like how to stop the

514
02:25:38,549 --> 02:25:57,299
monster. No, that was just like geolocation. Is this like a dress? Oh. Cheeto location.

515
02:25:58,020 --> 02:26:47,129
I need to be able to hear shit. Sir! Straight through here. Oh my god. Should I turn around

516
02:26:47,129 --> 02:27:34,459
and run the other way? Looks like a receptacle or something. Hear this! What do I do? I hear

517
02:27:34,540 --> 02:27:37,739
something moving over here behind me. I need to fill this up with oil.

518
02:27:48,139 --> 02:27:54,059
I didn't change the game. Away from Dino D-Day. Whatever it's called. What's it called? Island

519
02:27:54,059 --> 02:27:59,659
Dino? Is there a mod with power? Can you change it? No, I did change it. I'm just

520
02:27:59,659 --> 02:28:41,909
panicking right now. Give me this. Give me these. Give me those. Give me this.

521
02:28:48,469 --> 02:28:57,940
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! What is this? What is this? What is that for?

522
02:28:58,739 --> 02:29:16,700
A human eye. Find the eyes. Oh no, that's gonna activate her. I just activated her.

523
02:29:16,700 --> 02:29:38,709
I just activated her! All right, I'm gonna have to- I'm gonna- I'm going with the

524
02:29:38,709 --> 02:29:49,110
Burger Boy technique. You ready? Burger Boy technique. What would Burger Boy do? He would

525
02:29:49,110 --> 02:30:17,139
do this. All right, I'm ready to breath from here. All right, I can go that way. One of

526
02:30:17,139 --> 02:30:32,120
these is gonna open. That's the good witch of the west, right? The good witch of the east.

527
02:30:35,139 --> 02:30:49,239
That did it. It must be another eye. The snake?

528
02:31:24,709 --> 02:31:33,979
Where is that person coming from? Where is that person coming from? There's a room

529
02:31:34,620 --> 02:31:54,010
to the left. Monoculars. Walking along the corridor, I can hear my footsteps,

530
02:31:54,010 --> 02:31:58,870
my breathing, but also something else. A scraping sound coming from the darkness behind me.

531
02:31:59,510 --> 02:32:02,870
It ceased when I stopped to look around me, but now I can hear it again.

532
02:32:03,989 --> 02:32:09,829
Is that supposed to be a tutorial? That's a tutorial, right? What tutorial does that mean?

533
02:32:09,829 --> 02:32:21,319
Just don't look behind me. I wanna make something very clear here. I am bumping into

534
02:32:21,319 --> 02:32:34,920
something right here. I cannot go back. I'm bumping into an object. She's literally right on me.

535
02:32:34,920 --> 02:32:40,440
I'm bumping into her back. I'm in like a fucking line at Disney World bumping into her.

536
02:32:41,079 --> 02:33:20,620
She's right there. You can go ahead and just stay in there if you'd like.

537
02:33:20,620 --> 02:33:25,700
I'm trying to close the door. Just stay in there. You don't have to worry about me.

538
02:33:28,340 --> 02:33:43,620
I'm just gonna walk. I have an itchy eyeball.

539
02:33:48,219 --> 02:33:53,159
She's gonna be behind me and she's just gonna jump in and scare me.

540
02:33:55,379 --> 02:34:22,520
It's a big room. I'm like a shuffling old man.

541
02:34:55,739 --> 02:35:32,459
She's right fucking there. I'm not looking. She might be in one of the... I got an itchy

542
02:35:32,459 --> 02:35:50,229
ass. Hold on. Is this thing gonna stand up? Why did I wake up alone and I have no answer?

543
02:35:50,229 --> 02:35:53,590
My head still hurts so perhaps I stayed unconscious for too long but

544
02:35:53,590 --> 02:35:56,309
they wouldn't have waited for me. That is unless they couldn't stay here.

545
02:35:57,030 --> 02:36:10,200
Oh fuck off lady. That's fine. I'll just stay over here. Can I see like a shadow behind me?

546
02:36:10,200 --> 02:36:44,090
I can't. I can't move. Can I? Be gone!

547
02:36:50,120 --> 02:36:53,479
Ah shit. Okay. What's the... Okay. You can go down here.

548
02:37:29,180 --> 02:37:36,729
What? This creature moves when you look away. Don't turn your back to it. I thought I was

549
02:37:36,729 --> 02:37:47,620
supposed to like put my back towards the creature. What? So the thing was just glued to me the whole

550
02:37:47,620 --> 02:38:00,729
time? So I have to stare at that lady. I'm sitting there like backing up. She's just like

551
02:38:00,729 --> 02:38:15,559
dancing behind me. Oh man that was... Oh god. There's more than one. Oh that's unbelievable.

552
02:38:15,559 --> 02:38:23,290
The whole thing is computer generated right? The whole thing is just computer generated.

553
02:38:23,290 --> 02:38:36,260
Alright where are you guys? I want to make sure I'm in the right spot. God damn it.

554
02:38:38,840 --> 02:38:51,379
So I did find the other eyes. I was done. God. Alright let's go. I knew she was in the room too.

555
02:38:52,340 --> 02:39:01,399
Oh I hurt my whole body. There's got to be another eye. Alright I gotta stare right at the lady.

556
02:39:04,229 --> 02:39:09,459
I hate that mechanic. I hate this mechanic. I don't like this mechanic.

557
02:39:10,100 --> 02:39:18,600
Okay stare at her. Right stare right at her face. Come here lady. I don't want any trouble

558
02:39:18,600 --> 02:40:00,020
with you. Where the fuck is she? It's just pillows. Oh dude no no no. Humans weren't supposed to be

559
02:40:00,020 --> 02:40:18,459
doing this shit. Where are you? Where are you? Where are you? Hello? Yep you're over here

560
02:40:18,459 --> 02:40:48,840
somewhere. Humans weren't supposed to be doing this. I looked at you. I'm looking at you right

561
02:40:48,840 --> 02:41:01,110
now. I'm looking at you right now. Food just came up out of my mouth. Like old food.

562
02:41:01,110 --> 02:41:31,590
I just like puked. I just tasted tobacco. How? Was I eating cigarettes in my sleep?

563
02:41:31,590 --> 02:41:48,540
It's not that even back here. I gotta go down that hall.

564
02:41:48,540 --> 02:41:58,149
Oh shit. In my pants. I think she's behind me. I gotta look at her. Hey hey hey hey hey hey

565
02:41:58,149 --> 02:42:09,079
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey there! Hey there! Hey boy! Hey! Hi!

566
02:42:09,079 --> 02:42:13,850
Don't you dare get out of that! You! That hurt you!

567
02:42:13,850 --> 02:42:21,520
I'm looking at you! I'm looking at you! I'm looking at you! Huh?

568
02:42:21,520 --> 02:42:38,420
This is wrong monster. You shouldn't have looked at her.

569
02:42:38,420 --> 02:42:57,659
Don't look at the lady. Look at the other one. I thought they were both ladies.

570
02:42:57,659 --> 02:43:03,540
I don't do well in this environment, man. I got both the headphones in.

571
02:43:05,979 --> 02:43:30,350
I'm fucking... I'm eating cigarettes in my sleep.

572
02:43:30,350 --> 02:43:41,690
Alright, I'm gonna just do it. It's like sweat all over my mouth.

573
02:43:41,690 --> 02:43:46,319
Are you gonna give me a weapon?

574
02:43:46,319 --> 02:43:49,139
Come on, am I getting Luigi?

575
02:43:49,139 --> 02:43:53,819
Sid, he was the one who told me about the god and this place.

576
02:43:53,819 --> 02:43:56,420
He didn't want to come, not at first, but I convinced him.

577
02:43:56,420 --> 02:44:01,219
I wanted to see it. I needed to.

578
02:44:01,219 --> 02:44:04,170
Points.

579
02:44:05,659 --> 02:44:14,780
I'm thinking how big this map is.

580
02:44:14,780 --> 02:44:20,149
Ugh. So this... Don't look at lady.

581
02:44:20,149 --> 02:44:24,389
Look at the... the smoke monster?

582
02:44:24,389 --> 02:44:34,739
So, the cloud of dust. Look at the dust cloud. Don't look at lady.

583
02:44:34,739 --> 02:44:39,809
Is there any other monsters that I need to have tutorials on?

584
02:44:39,809 --> 02:44:43,430
But they both look like they could be made out of the dust.

585
02:44:43,430 --> 02:44:51,409
Ugh. Standing around and...

586
02:44:51,409 --> 02:44:54,409
Okay, is that the duster or is that her? It's a duster.

587
02:44:54,409 --> 02:45:12,049
Magic staff. What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it do?

588
02:45:21,629 --> 02:45:42,459
Take me. I have no idea what that does.

589
02:45:46,870 --> 02:45:53,120
I feel like this is important.

590
02:45:53,120 --> 02:46:14,930
Should I do something with that?

591
02:46:14,930 --> 02:46:19,149
What is the point?

592
02:46:19,149 --> 02:46:43,829
Alright, bye. Is this a safe room? Can I come back here and...

593
02:46:43,829 --> 02:46:45,829
I have no clothes.

594
02:46:51,489 --> 02:47:02,260
Don't look at lady. Look at the dust cloud.

595
02:47:02,260 --> 02:47:04,260
And do I have to run from lady?

596
02:47:04,260 --> 02:47:23,780
The hallways connect and it just causes me so much fucking stress.

597
02:47:23,780 --> 02:47:27,870
Is it? I don't know. Is that it? I don't know what that is.

598
02:47:27,870 --> 02:47:29,870
I don't know what that is. Someone's crawling.

599
02:47:29,870 --> 02:47:35,940
I don't know what that is.

600
02:47:35,940 --> 02:47:38,940
Somebody's like crawling on the ceiling?

601
02:47:38,940 --> 02:47:40,940
Somebody crawling on the ceiling? I don't know.

602
02:47:40,940 --> 02:47:49,239
This is horrible.

603
02:47:49,239 --> 02:47:54,809
Ugh. Damn it.

604
02:47:54,809 --> 02:47:57,180
God damn it. I don't know what I'm doing.

605
02:47:57,180 --> 02:47:59,180
God damn it. It's lady. Don't look at the lady.

606
02:47:59,180 --> 02:48:01,850
God damn it.

607
02:48:01,850 --> 02:48:04,219
God damn it.

608
02:48:04,219 --> 02:48:07,420
God damn it.

609
02:48:07,420 --> 02:48:10,420
God damn it.

610
02:48:10,420 --> 02:48:13,110
God! Is that a boss? Is that a guy? Is that a boss?

611
02:48:13,110 --> 02:48:15,110
Is it a boss?

612
02:48:15,110 --> 02:48:17,110
Is it a skeleton or a boss?

613
02:48:17,110 --> 02:48:19,350
I don't know. I don't know.

614
02:48:19,350 --> 02:48:21,350
No, I'm not. I gotta move. Where am I gonna go?

615
02:48:21,350 --> 02:48:23,350
Is it a dust cloud? Is it a dust cloud behind me?

616
02:48:23,350 --> 02:48:27,129
This is unbearable.

617
02:48:27,129 --> 02:48:29,819
Holy shit. Come on, give me the eye.

618
02:48:29,819 --> 02:48:31,819
No, another dead end.

619
02:48:31,819 --> 02:48:36,549
Shit.

620
02:48:36,549 --> 02:48:39,620
Is that the lady or is that the...

621
02:48:39,620 --> 02:48:41,620
It's a smoke man.

622
02:48:41,620 --> 02:48:44,309
That's a smoke guy, right?

623
02:48:44,309 --> 02:48:50,629
Stare at the smoke.

624
02:48:50,629 --> 02:48:52,629
Down, down, down, down, down, down,

625
02:48:52,629 --> 02:48:54,629
out, out, out, out, out.

626
02:48:54,629 --> 02:49:04,860
Okay. Do you go away?

627
02:49:04,860 --> 02:49:12,069
Mission accomplished.

628
02:49:12,069 --> 02:49:20,969
No, how dare you come out now.

629
02:49:20,969 --> 02:49:22,969
How dare you come out now.

630
02:49:26,489 --> 02:49:36,219
Is that a person? I don't know.

631
02:49:36,219 --> 02:49:41,719
Wait a minute. Is that a thing? What is that thing?

632
02:49:41,719 --> 02:49:47,290
Yeah, yeah.

633
02:49:47,290 --> 02:49:49,530
I was never scared of small places

634
02:49:49,530 --> 02:49:51,530
but the walls of these narrow corridors seem to be

635
02:49:51,530 --> 02:49:53,530
suffering from a lot of attempts to feel like I can't breathe. Yeah, fine.

636
02:49:53,530 --> 02:49:59,540
Oh, fuck.

637
02:49:59,540 --> 02:50:07,350
I don't know if it's the lady or if it's the smoke.

638
02:50:07,350 --> 02:50:14,139
It's not the smoke.

639
02:50:14,139 --> 02:50:16,139
It's not the smoke. It's smoke, I think, right?

640
02:50:16,139 --> 02:50:18,139
It's not smoke. It's not smoke.

641
02:50:18,139 --> 02:50:20,139
It's not smoke. It's not smoke.

642
02:50:20,139 --> 02:50:33,940
It's smoke!

643
02:50:33,940 --> 02:50:39,899
No, no, no, no, no, no.

644
02:50:39,899 --> 02:50:43,479
No, no, no, no, no.

645
02:50:43,479 --> 02:50:51,350
Okay, straight ahead.

646
02:50:51,350 --> 02:50:53,350
I don't care about shit about money.

647
02:50:53,350 --> 02:50:55,350
I don't care about money.

648
02:50:55,350 --> 02:50:57,350
Can I turn that? Can I please pull this?

649
02:50:57,350 --> 02:50:59,350
Sir?

650
02:50:59,350 --> 02:51:01,350
I hear him again.

651
02:51:01,350 --> 02:51:03,909
Don't you dare.

652
02:51:03,909 --> 02:51:09,860
Get down. Back to hell.

653
02:51:09,860 --> 02:51:23,180
Why can I not pull that?

654
02:51:23,180 --> 02:51:29,770
I have to go to the doctor after this.

655
02:51:29,770 --> 02:51:31,770
So why can I not pull this?

656
02:51:31,770 --> 02:51:46,020
Where is this damn thing?

657
02:51:46,020 --> 02:51:48,020
Left and then down this hole.

658
02:51:48,020 --> 02:51:56,219
Okay, here's what I need you guys to do for me.

659
02:51:56,219 --> 02:51:58,219
I need you guys to scream in the chat

660
02:51:58,219 --> 02:52:00,219
Is that lady or smoke? My brain, I can't do it.

661
02:52:00,219 --> 02:52:09,370
You understand?

662
02:52:09,370 --> 02:52:12,250
Is that lady or smoke? Which one is it?

663
02:52:12,250 --> 02:52:15,319
Is that lady or smoke?

664
02:52:15,319 --> 02:52:19,799
Which one is that one?

665
02:52:19,799 --> 02:52:27,350
Lady?

666
02:52:27,350 --> 02:52:30,809
Is it smoke?

667
02:52:30,809 --> 02:52:33,879
I hear something.

668
02:52:33,879 --> 02:52:35,879
Is it smoke?

669
02:52:35,879 --> 02:52:40,870
I'm fucking panicking right now.

670
02:52:40,870 --> 02:52:45,989
This is so bad.

671
02:52:45,989 --> 02:52:53,739
I don't know.

672
02:52:53,739 --> 02:52:56,620
Don't listen to chat.

673
02:52:56,620 --> 02:53:00,709
Sweat is fogging up these mirrors.

674
02:53:00,709 --> 02:53:19,459
Almost there.

675
02:53:19,459 --> 02:53:21,459
Almost there.

676
02:53:21,459 --> 02:53:34,459
I'm there.

677
02:53:34,459 --> 02:53:48,600
Hey!

678
02:53:48,600 --> 02:53:50,600
It's a smoke person. I think it's a smoke person.

679
02:53:50,600 --> 02:53:54,379
I'm not cut out for these games.

680
02:53:54,379 --> 02:54:03,260
There it is.

681
02:54:03,260 --> 02:54:05,260
I tapped something. What did I tap?

682
02:54:05,260 --> 02:54:08,899
What happened?

683
02:54:08,899 --> 02:54:10,899
Is this what I wanted when I decided to come here?

684
02:54:10,899 --> 02:54:13,270
This is a horrible place. I always knew what it would be.

685
02:54:13,270 --> 02:54:16,340
Why am I here?

686
02:54:16,340 --> 02:54:21,190
An exit.

687
02:54:21,190 --> 02:54:32,520
Am I out? Is this wind?

688
02:54:32,520 --> 02:54:34,520
I missed oil. It's alright.

689
02:54:34,520 --> 02:54:38,170
I've been missing some fucking brain cells after this one.

690
02:54:38,170 --> 02:54:40,170
I've been missing some fucking brain cells after this one.

691
02:54:40,170 --> 02:54:43,500
I'm too neurotic of a person to play these games.

692
02:54:43,500 --> 02:54:45,500
I'm too neurotic of a person to play these games.

693
02:54:45,500 --> 02:54:47,500
This is too more to do.

694
02:54:47,500 --> 02:55:00,340
This is too more to do.

695
02:55:00,340 --> 02:55:02,340
I think I'm just gonna go, like I said before,

696
02:55:02,340 --> 02:55:04,340
with the original tactic

697
02:55:04,340 --> 02:55:06,340
of just run as fast as I can to the exit.

698
02:55:06,340 --> 02:55:08,340
of just run as fast as I can to the exit.

699
02:55:08,340 --> 02:55:12,569
I feel like that's gonna be a good idea.

700
02:55:12,569 --> 02:55:22,020
Good luck.

701
02:55:22,020 --> 02:55:24,020
My back hurts right now.

702
02:55:24,020 --> 02:55:26,020
This is just like tense.

703
02:55:26,020 --> 02:55:29,610
I'm gonna have to go get like a massage.

704
02:55:29,610 --> 02:55:31,610
Oh, you have a lot of tension.

705
02:55:31,610 --> 02:55:33,610
Wow, is this from work?

706
02:55:33,610 --> 02:55:35,780
Uh, I mean, maybe.

707
02:55:35,780 --> 02:55:37,780
Oh, wow.

708
02:55:37,780 --> 02:55:39,780
Do you like construction?

709
02:55:39,780 --> 02:55:41,780
Do you sit down for a long time?

710
02:55:41,780 --> 02:55:43,780
I was playing a VR game on Twitch.

711
02:55:43,780 --> 02:55:45,780
I was playing a horror game.

712
02:55:45,780 --> 02:55:47,780
I was playing a horror game.

713
02:55:47,780 --> 02:55:50,090
Oh, yeah, that's what I did for work.

714
02:55:50,090 --> 02:55:53,610
That's fucking kind of weird, but okay.

715
02:55:53,610 --> 02:55:57,319
That's fucking kind of weird, but okay.

716
02:55:57,319 --> 02:55:59,319
Do a narrow-toed run into the entrance. Sure.

717
02:55:59,319 --> 02:56:27,340
No, it's the other thing. Hold on.

718
02:56:27,340 --> 02:56:40,569
There you go. It's time to go.

719
02:56:40,569 --> 02:56:42,569
I'm not gonna waste any time. Get it open.

720
02:56:42,569 --> 02:57:19,430
Go.

721
02:57:19,430 --> 02:57:23,829
Fuck you! Fuck you!

722
02:57:23,829 --> 02:57:49,430
It's a lady. It's a lady.

723
02:57:49,430 --> 02:57:52,440
I need to not look at the lady. Look at the statue.

724
02:57:52,440 --> 02:57:54,440
I need to look at the statue. Don't tell me

725
02:57:54,440 --> 02:57:56,440
to look at the statue that's right here.

726
02:57:56,440 --> 02:57:58,440
The statue... Oh, would you look at the

727
02:57:58,440 --> 02:58:00,440
statue that's right there. You know,

728
02:58:00,440 --> 02:58:02,440
the fucking monster that's gonna jump

729
02:58:02,440 --> 02:58:04,440
in your face because you looked at the statue.

730
02:58:04,440 --> 02:58:37,979
Oh, man, that thing.

731
02:58:37,979 --> 02:58:40,979
He got off the pedestal, right?

732
02:58:40,979 --> 02:58:46,489
That's what this is.

733
02:58:58,520 --> 02:59:02,360
Punch it.

734
02:59:02,360 --> 02:59:05,110
Who's doing that one?

735
02:59:05,110 --> 02:59:07,110
Am I gonna get crowded by monsters?

736
02:59:07,110 --> 02:59:09,110
I have to move. I gotta move.

737
02:59:09,110 --> 02:59:11,110
But I don't know what that means. If I turn around, is he gonna follow me?

738
02:59:11,110 --> 02:59:13,110
I don't know.

739
02:59:13,110 --> 02:59:15,110
I don't understand. If I leave this room, is he gonna follow me behind me?

740
02:59:15,110 --> 02:59:17,110
I don't know what to do here.

741
02:59:17,110 --> 02:59:19,110
I'm so fucking... I don't know.

742
02:59:19,110 --> 02:59:44,579
The door's open here.

743
02:59:44,579 --> 02:59:51,819
Okay, I'm gonna say left.

744
02:59:51,819 --> 02:59:55,850
Okay, fuck you. Bye.

745
02:59:55,850 --> 03:00:03,590
Don't look at the lady. Look at the smoke

746
03:00:03,590 --> 03:00:07,299
and look at the statue guy. Is he behind me?

747
03:00:07,299 --> 03:00:09,299
Fucking crawling.

748
03:00:09,299 --> 03:00:12,760
Oh, God.

749
03:00:14,760 --> 03:00:16,760
Go, go, go, go. Out, out, out, out.

750
03:00:16,760 --> 03:00:19,770
Oil, oil, oil, oil in the can.

751
03:00:19,770 --> 03:00:24,700
Go, go, go.

752
03:00:24,700 --> 03:00:26,700
Oh, you bitch. No.

753
03:00:26,700 --> 03:00:31,430
It's the same room?

754
03:00:31,430 --> 03:00:51,379
Oh!

755
03:00:51,379 --> 03:00:54,579
Only one more and I get a prize.

756
03:00:54,579 --> 03:01:03,930
Um, what the hell is that?

757
03:01:05,930 --> 03:01:22,180
This is it. One more.

758
03:01:22,180 --> 03:01:32,299
This game's crazy. Look in that door.

759
03:01:32,299 --> 03:01:40,040
What?

760
03:01:40,040 --> 03:01:46,819
I've already been down there. Don't, don't.

761
03:01:46,819 --> 03:01:48,819
Your fly is down. I don't have a fly right now.

762
03:01:48,819 --> 03:01:51,639
I'm wearing workout pants.

763
03:01:51,639 --> 03:01:53,639
Alright, let's go.

764
03:01:53,639 --> 03:02:09,260
Am I getting a shield?

765
03:02:09,260 --> 03:02:13,799
Do I get to have a shield?

766
03:02:13,799 --> 03:02:21,610
That's a huge shield.

767
03:02:21,610 --> 03:02:23,610
So let me just clarify this one more time.

768
03:02:23,610 --> 03:02:27,879
The statue,

769
03:02:27,879 --> 03:02:29,879
I've got to look at that statue. You guys are not just fucking with me.

770
03:02:29,879 --> 03:02:31,879
That's a real monster.

771
03:02:31,879 --> 03:02:41,670
I just want to make sure.

772
03:02:41,670 --> 03:02:43,670
So I've got to burn smoke guy,

773
03:02:43,670 --> 03:02:45,670
don't look at lady, look at statue.

774
03:02:45,670 --> 03:02:55,340
I'm going to have to like,

775
03:02:55,340 --> 03:02:57,340
I'm going to have to wipe down this visor.

776
03:02:57,340 --> 03:02:59,700
It's so dirty from my sweat.

777
03:02:59,700 --> 03:03:13,850
Give me like a lucky break right here.

778
03:03:13,850 --> 03:03:15,850
And it's right here. I don't even care about that.

779
03:03:15,850 --> 03:03:17,850
This is a difficult lock. Let's just get it open.

780
03:03:17,850 --> 03:03:19,850
I hear somebody.

781
03:03:19,850 --> 03:03:27,129
I hear something.

782
03:03:27,129 --> 03:03:33,530
Is that the gargoyle?

783
03:03:33,530 --> 03:03:40,309
What the fuck is that?

784
03:03:40,309 --> 03:03:44,469
What did I do about the giant dog?

785
03:03:46,469 --> 03:04:09,110
This has been like a YouTuber scream stream.

786
03:04:09,110 --> 03:04:11,110
This has been just like,

787
03:04:11,110 --> 03:04:18,280
welcome to my YouTube channel.

788
03:04:18,280 --> 03:04:20,280
I scream at horror games.

789
03:04:20,280 --> 03:04:23,540
Thankfully, thank God I'm standing up in a position

790
03:04:23,540 --> 03:04:25,540
where I'm away from the microphone.

791
03:04:25,540 --> 03:04:27,540
The mic would have peaked like 16 times tonight.

792
03:04:27,540 --> 03:04:29,540
Thank God it's bouncing off the walls.

793
03:04:29,540 --> 03:04:31,780
That guy was huge.

794
03:04:31,780 --> 03:04:36,329
Oh, that sucks.

795
03:04:36,329 --> 03:04:38,329
Oh,

796
03:04:38,329 --> 03:04:40,329
that thing's ridiculous.

797
03:04:40,329 --> 03:04:42,950
Where's the right way to look?

798
03:04:42,950 --> 03:04:46,090
I think it's so scary.

799
03:04:46,090 --> 03:04:52,860
It's so much bigger than everything, too.

800
03:04:52,860 --> 03:04:55,420
And this is all procedurally generated.

801
03:04:55,420 --> 03:04:57,420
Now that I know he exists,

802
03:04:57,420 --> 03:05:04,579
I don't want to play anymore.

803
03:05:04,579 --> 03:05:06,579
Is he

804
03:05:06,579 --> 03:05:38,700
coming down this hall?

805
03:05:38,700 --> 03:05:40,700
I think he's behind me.

806
03:05:40,700 --> 03:05:45,370
Hello?

807
03:05:45,370 --> 03:05:51,940
Somebody's opened a door.

808
03:05:51,940 --> 03:05:54,500
Can he open doors?

809
03:05:54,500 --> 03:05:56,500
Can he open doors?

810
03:05:56,500 --> 03:06:12,680
Shh, calm down. I'm gonna hate these little rooms.

811
03:06:12,680 --> 03:06:18,549
I'm gonna come out here and bang him right.

812
03:06:18,549 --> 03:06:32,170
Can he open doors?

813
03:06:32,170 --> 03:06:46,889
Do you hear something?

814
03:06:46,889 --> 03:07:15,500
Shit! Shit, man!

815
03:07:15,500 --> 03:07:25,219
Okay, it's gonna be right here to the left.

816
03:07:25,219 --> 03:07:31,610
It's gonna be in this room.

817
03:07:31,610 --> 03:07:34,090
Damn it! It's not in there.

818
03:07:34,090 --> 03:07:38,889
I don't even want to go in there.

819
03:07:38,889 --> 03:07:48,809
It's gonna be right in here, right to the left, and right in this room.

820
03:07:48,809 --> 03:07:51,239
Oh, thank God it's one of those sanctuary rooms.

821
03:07:51,239 --> 03:07:53,479
Oh, yes.

822
03:07:53,479 --> 03:08:04,280
I'm safe in here, right?

823
03:08:04,280 --> 03:08:09,399
Thank God. I just heard a person.

824
03:08:09,399 --> 03:08:12,840
I just heard a person.

825
03:08:12,840 --> 03:08:21,989
Are we certain of this?

826
03:08:21,989 --> 03:08:39,780
Why did I hear somebody's voice?

827
03:08:39,780 --> 03:08:42,090
It's right in here, right?

828
03:08:42,090 --> 03:08:49,510
Don't do me like this.

829
03:08:49,510 --> 03:08:58,219
Don't do me like this.

830
03:08:58,219 --> 03:09:17,209
Don't do me like this.

831
03:09:17,209 --> 03:09:19,700
I hear something.

832
03:09:19,700 --> 03:09:29,290
Bullshit! That's a lady, right?

833
03:09:29,290 --> 03:09:32,040
No, what does that mean?

834
03:09:32,040 --> 03:09:34,040
I don't know what that thing means.

835
03:09:34,040 --> 03:09:36,790
I think that attracts people.

836
03:09:36,790 --> 03:09:40,309
No, that attracts a bad person.

837
03:09:40,309 --> 03:09:42,620
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Is it the smoke?

838
03:09:42,620 --> 03:09:49,530
Is it smoke?

839
03:09:49,530 --> 03:09:52,149
I think the smoke guy is literally right behind me.

840
03:09:52,149 --> 03:09:54,149
I think it's smoke.

841
03:09:54,149 --> 03:09:56,840
I don't know what to do. I'm scared.

842
03:09:56,840 --> 03:09:58,840
I'm not gonna answer it. Just give me the keys.

843
03:09:58,840 --> 03:10:01,399
Just give me the keys.

844
03:10:01,399 --> 03:10:03,399
Just give me the fucking keys. Where are the keys?

845
03:10:03,399 --> 03:10:05,399
Just give me the keys.

846
03:10:05,399 --> 03:10:07,399
I looked everywhere. Where are the goddamn keys?

847
03:10:07,399 --> 03:10:09,399
Where are the goddamn keys? I don't even know what I'm looking at here.

848
03:10:09,399 --> 03:10:18,229
What the fuck is this?

849
03:10:18,229 --> 03:10:22,260
Motherfucker. Come on.

850
03:10:22,260 --> 03:10:35,620
It's gonna be in this room.

851
03:10:35,620 --> 03:10:38,569
You son of a bitch.

852
03:10:38,569 --> 03:10:40,569
Smoke guy.

853
03:10:40,569 --> 03:10:42,569
How dare you?

854
03:10:42,569 --> 03:10:48,899
What? Look at him!

855
03:10:48,899 --> 03:10:50,899
What the fuck?

856
03:10:50,899 --> 03:11:03,620
What happened?

857
03:11:03,620 --> 03:11:11,370
I was holding the lantern in his face.

858
03:11:11,370 --> 03:11:20,200
Was there no oil in the lamp?

859
03:11:20,200 --> 03:11:22,200
Not enough oil?

860
03:11:22,200 --> 03:11:34,229
Didn't I just fill it?

861
03:11:36,229 --> 03:11:43,719
Shadows don't care.

862
03:11:43,719 --> 03:11:46,860
It needs to be refilled immediately.

863
03:11:46,860 --> 03:11:51,340
I checked so many places too.

864
03:11:51,340 --> 03:11:53,340
I checked so many places too.

865
03:11:53,340 --> 03:11:55,639
That whole map was uncovered.

866
03:11:55,639 --> 03:11:57,639
And I only had the two places I didn't go.

867
03:11:57,639 --> 03:11:59,639
And I only had the two places I didn't go.

868
03:11:59,639 --> 03:12:02,260
I got destroyed.

869
03:12:02,260 --> 03:12:07,129
Gonna talk to the face on the wall.

870
03:12:07,129 --> 03:12:15,959
This thing.

871
03:12:15,959 --> 03:12:19,030
Why did you wake us?

872
03:12:19,030 --> 03:12:21,030
Paid two coins. But what?

873
03:12:21,030 --> 03:12:23,659
What am I paying for?

874
03:12:23,659 --> 03:12:25,659
You have 21 old coins. You wish to pay the price?

875
03:12:25,659 --> 03:12:38,700
Ask.

876
03:12:38,700 --> 03:12:40,700
You were drawn here by the shadows.

877
03:12:40,700 --> 03:12:42,700
Enthralled by them.

878
03:12:42,700 --> 03:12:44,700
It was you who stepped into the darkness.

879
03:12:44,700 --> 03:12:46,700
It was you who chose to be bound by it.

880
03:12:46,700 --> 03:12:48,700
It was you who chose to be bound by it.

881
03:12:48,700 --> 03:12:50,700
You are nothing but their pawn.

882
03:12:50,700 --> 03:12:53,000
Did this cost me two dollars for that?

883
03:12:53,000 --> 03:12:59,340
Did this cost me two dollars for that?

884
03:12:59,340 --> 03:13:03,180
Now you're gonna go in a shell?

885
03:13:03,180 --> 03:13:05,180
There's two bucks.

886
03:13:05,180 --> 03:13:18,409
Okay.

887
03:13:18,409 --> 03:13:21,540
I'm so close too.

888
03:13:21,540 --> 03:13:23,540
Damn. I had it.

889
03:13:23,540 --> 03:13:25,540
It was so much stress but I almost did it.

890
03:13:25,540 --> 03:13:27,540
I was almost ready. I was almost out of there.

891
03:13:27,540 --> 03:13:32,600
I gotta make sure I'm in the right spot here.

892
03:13:32,600 --> 03:13:39,379
I thought it was dark in this room.

893
03:13:39,379 --> 03:13:42,579
Alright. Let's just start here.

894
03:13:42,579 --> 03:13:45,659
I'm gonna try again.

895
03:13:45,659 --> 03:13:47,659
I felt something just on my neck but it's my sweat.

896
03:13:47,659 --> 03:13:50,280
A sweat bead just went down the back of my neck.

897
03:13:50,280 --> 03:13:52,280
And I thought it was a bug.

898
03:13:52,280 --> 03:13:56,950
Jesus.

899
03:13:56,950 --> 03:13:58,950
Can I talk to this thing?

900
03:13:58,950 --> 03:14:05,799
This thing doesn't want to speak to me.

901
03:14:05,799 --> 03:14:10,540
Alright.

902
03:14:10,540 --> 03:14:19,930
I was so close.

903
03:14:19,930 --> 03:14:28,250
Just let me get lucky here.

904
03:14:28,250 --> 03:14:51,159
What if I just hold my fist?

905
03:14:51,159 --> 03:14:53,159
Oh my fucking Jesus! My God!

906
03:14:53,159 --> 03:14:58,469
You can't get in here!

907
03:15:26,819 --> 03:15:32,840
Come on. Just give me the key.

908
03:15:32,840 --> 03:15:35,340
Let me get out of this fucking place.

909
03:15:35,340 --> 03:15:47,620
Where's that dog again?

910
03:15:47,620 --> 03:15:52,040
Where's that darn dog?

911
03:15:52,040 --> 03:15:57,290
The lady's in here with me.

912
03:15:57,290 --> 03:15:59,290
Close the door.

913
03:15:59,290 --> 03:16:06,899
Just leave me the fuck alone.

914
03:16:06,899 --> 03:16:08,899
I can't believe it.

915
03:16:08,899 --> 03:16:14,790
Can't believe it that she's in here.

916
03:16:14,790 --> 03:16:23,049
And is there a smoke monster?

917
03:16:23,049 --> 03:16:25,049
Can you spawn in here as well?

918
03:16:25,049 --> 03:16:27,049
You've got to be fucking shitting me, sir.

919
03:16:29,420 --> 03:16:33,319
Okay, well that was fun at the party.

920
03:16:33,319 --> 03:16:35,319
The fucking scary people.

921
03:16:38,120 --> 03:16:40,120
The scary people party. That was fun of us to go out and hang out here.

922
03:17:01,110 --> 03:17:03,110
A full squad just landed on me.

923
03:17:03,110 --> 03:17:06,819
I have to go that way.

924
03:17:06,819 --> 03:17:11,370
I have to go this way.

925
03:17:11,370 --> 03:17:14,440
Get me out of the doorway, please.

926
03:17:19,030 --> 03:17:22,790
Sanctuary room.

927
03:17:22,790 --> 03:17:24,790
Ah.

928
03:17:24,790 --> 03:17:26,790
Show me with light in the

929
03:17:26,790 --> 03:17:28,790
sanctuary room of our father.

930
03:17:28,790 --> 03:17:35,299
Thank God.

931
03:17:35,299 --> 03:17:37,299
What the hell do you want to tell me, lady?

932
03:17:37,299 --> 03:17:43,379
What is your question?

933
03:17:43,379 --> 03:17:47,030
About the coins.

934
03:17:47,030 --> 03:17:49,030
Token of devotion.

935
03:17:49,030 --> 03:17:51,030
What? What?

936
03:17:51,030 --> 03:17:53,030
What? What?

937
03:17:53,030 --> 03:17:55,030
What? What?

938
03:17:55,030 --> 03:17:58,809
What is it?

939
03:17:58,809 --> 03:18:00,809
What is it? Something in my

940
03:18:00,809 --> 03:18:02,809
sanctuary room? Something in my

941
03:18:02,809 --> 03:18:05,690
sanctuary room?

942
03:18:05,690 --> 03:18:08,500
Is it the lady?

943
03:18:08,500 --> 03:18:12,020
What are you doing in my fucking room?

944
03:18:12,020 --> 03:18:19,959
Guys?

945
03:18:29,579 --> 03:18:32,709
Let's go over here.

946
03:18:40,709 --> 03:18:42,709
This is horrible.

947
03:18:42,709 --> 03:18:44,709
This is the most stressed I've ever been on a stream.

948
03:18:44,709 --> 03:18:47,399
Am I? Ever.

949
03:18:47,399 --> 03:18:49,639
This is the most stressed I've ever been.

950
03:18:49,639 --> 03:18:51,639
It's the fucking lady again. They're just like dumping on me.

951
03:18:51,639 --> 03:18:53,639
They're collapsing on me.

952
03:18:53,639 --> 03:18:56,010
Light in the lantern. I don't have any more light.

953
03:18:56,010 --> 03:18:58,760
Left trigger. Turn the light back on.

954
03:18:58,760 --> 03:19:00,760
What the fuck is happening?

955
03:19:00,760 --> 03:19:04,149
Why is this happening to me?

956
03:19:04,149 --> 03:19:06,649
They're relentless.

957
03:19:06,649 --> 03:19:08,819
They are relentless.

958
03:19:08,819 --> 03:19:14,379
I think I've had enough fun.

959
03:19:14,379 --> 03:19:16,379
I think it's time for me to

960
03:19:16,379 --> 03:19:18,379
do something else.

961
03:19:18,379 --> 03:19:21,059
I'm going to go take a bath.

962
03:19:21,059 --> 03:19:23,059
God damn it.

963
03:19:23,059 --> 03:19:29,979
I hear the dog now.

964
03:19:29,979 --> 03:19:31,979
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

965
03:19:31,979 --> 03:19:33,979
Give it to me. Come on.

966
03:19:33,979 --> 03:19:35,979
Give me the key. It's got to be right in here.

967
03:19:35,979 --> 03:19:43,190
I don't have any more lantern oil.

968
03:19:43,190 --> 03:19:45,190
Do I? Nope.

969
03:19:45,190 --> 03:19:48,569
Right here. Key.

970
03:19:48,569 --> 03:19:50,569
Do it. Key.

971
03:19:52,569 --> 03:19:54,940
Yeah.

972
03:19:54,940 --> 03:20:03,319
Thank God.

973
03:20:03,319 --> 03:20:11,000
Man, this is unbelievable.

974
03:20:11,000 --> 03:20:13,000
Now I see why people wanted me to play this.

975
03:20:13,000 --> 03:20:15,819
This is like one of the nerve wracking.

976
03:20:15,819 --> 03:20:17,819
There's so many people surrounding you that have different

977
03:20:17,819 --> 03:20:21,270
traits.

978
03:20:21,270 --> 03:20:24,219
Wait. Should I learn some more info?

979
03:20:24,219 --> 03:20:26,219
I'm going to summon a demon right now.

980
03:20:26,219 --> 03:20:29,780
Is it too late?

981
03:20:29,780 --> 03:20:32,020
No.

982
03:20:32,020 --> 03:20:41,110
There it is. There's another level.

983
03:20:41,110 --> 03:20:43,420
Yes. I'd like to talk.

984
03:20:43,420 --> 03:20:45,420
Oh, man.

985
03:20:45,420 --> 03:20:49,450
We demand payment.

986
03:20:49,450 --> 03:20:51,450
Ask why only one...

987
03:20:51,450 --> 03:20:53,450
Where were you before?

988
03:20:53,450 --> 03:20:55,450
Another wanderer.

989
03:20:55,450 --> 03:20:57,450
From beyond the walls of this world.

990
03:21:03,899 --> 03:21:05,899
I'd rather just sell these tokens

991
03:21:05,899 --> 03:21:14,469
on eBay.

992
03:21:14,469 --> 03:21:16,469
You can probably get like a hundred bucks

993
03:21:16,469 --> 03:21:18,469
per token. Some ancient artifact?

994
03:21:18,469 --> 03:21:20,469
Are you kidding me?

995
03:21:20,469 --> 03:21:22,469
Alright, well, let's see what's in store here.

996
03:21:22,469 --> 03:21:25,350
Make sure I'm facing the right way.

997
03:21:25,350 --> 03:21:30,010
I am.

998
03:21:30,010 --> 03:21:34,549
There's more.

999
03:21:34,549 --> 03:21:36,549
I actually have to do more of this shit.

1000
03:21:36,549 --> 03:21:45,059
This looks different.

1001
03:21:45,059 --> 03:21:50,819
Is this different?

1002
03:21:50,819 --> 03:22:02,520
What is this for?

1003
03:22:02,520 --> 03:22:15,319
Hey, I need some...

1004
03:22:15,319 --> 03:22:17,620
We demand payment.

1005
03:22:17,620 --> 03:22:19,620
Ask about the corpses. Ask about...

1006
03:22:19,620 --> 03:22:21,620
All the wanderers just like you

1007
03:22:21,620 --> 03:22:23,620
judged unworthy,

1008
03:22:23,620 --> 03:22:25,620
devoured by the shadows.

1009
03:22:25,620 --> 03:22:27,620
Okay.

1010
03:22:27,620 --> 03:22:32,620
Now it's three coins.

1011
03:22:32,620 --> 03:22:34,620
Your price went up.

1012
03:22:34,620 --> 03:22:37,620
What the hell? I can die from that thing?

1013
03:22:37,620 --> 03:22:40,889
I only have...

1014
03:22:40,889 --> 03:22:48,629
oil.

1015
03:22:48,629 --> 03:22:50,629
Fuck off with this.

1016
03:22:50,629 --> 03:23:03,159
What the hell is this?

1017
03:23:03,159 --> 03:23:11,799
What the hell is this?

1018
03:23:11,799 --> 03:23:13,799
Oh, you're going to make me do like a gauntlet here?

1019
03:23:13,799 --> 03:23:15,799
Well, this is fun, guys.

1020
03:23:15,799 --> 03:23:17,799
Thanks for playing. Thanks for hanging out.

1021
03:23:17,799 --> 03:23:19,799
The stone here is colder, sharper. I think I'm getting

1022
03:23:19,799 --> 03:23:21,799
closer to the pillars. I can hear their call.

1023
03:23:21,799 --> 03:23:25,959
This was Blast.

1024
03:23:25,959 --> 03:23:29,219
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

1025
03:23:42,520 --> 03:23:44,819
Give me some oil or something.

1026
03:23:44,819 --> 03:23:51,930
I mean, this is like a new hub world.

1027
03:23:51,930 --> 03:23:58,969
This is not going to be a new hub world,

1028
03:23:58,969 --> 03:24:04,600
right? It doesn't look like it.

1029
03:24:04,600 --> 03:24:09,850
It is a new hub world.

1030
03:24:09,850 --> 03:24:17,700
This game is

1031
03:24:17,700 --> 03:24:19,700
ten hours.

1032
03:24:19,700 --> 03:24:21,700
What?

1033
03:24:21,700 --> 03:24:23,700
This is like a 30 minute

1034
03:24:23,700 --> 03:24:25,700
stream experience.

1035
03:24:25,700 --> 03:24:38,420
It only takes so much of this in one sitting.

1036
03:24:38,420 --> 03:24:55,639
Ridiculous, though. Look at how much bigger

1037
03:24:55,639 --> 03:24:58,520
the areas are.

1038
03:24:58,520 --> 03:25:02,100
This is times two.

1039
03:25:02,100 --> 03:25:05,559
The amount of stress.

1040
03:25:05,559 --> 03:25:23,290
I can't even speak.

1041
03:25:23,290 --> 03:25:25,290
See you later. That's enough.

1042
03:25:25,290 --> 03:25:27,459
That's enough.

1043
03:25:27,459 --> 03:25:29,459
Yeah, that's enough.

1044
03:25:29,459 --> 03:25:37,530
I'm just going to walk over here and turn it off.

1045
03:25:37,530 --> 03:25:45,909
That's enough.

1046
03:25:45,909 --> 03:26:05,690
See you later. Bye.

1047
03:26:05,690 --> 03:26:13,110
Coward.

1048
03:26:13,110 --> 03:26:15,110
No, I can't.

1049
03:26:15,110 --> 03:26:21,000
I'll take beating the first area.

1050
03:26:21,000 --> 03:26:25,989
Finish it. Finish it.

1051
03:26:25,989 --> 03:26:27,989
I'm going to go ahead and go for...

1052
03:26:27,989 --> 03:26:29,989
We're going to play the boxing game.

1053
03:26:29,989 --> 03:26:33,000
I have not left the game.

1054
03:26:33,000 --> 03:26:35,000
That's right. I think there's a monster about to come over to me.

1055
03:26:35,000 --> 03:26:40,700
I'm going to play it with the OBS preview.

1056
03:26:40,700 --> 03:26:54,059
Ugh.

1057
03:26:54,059 --> 03:27:03,659
Copy the Wii.

1058
03:27:03,659 --> 03:27:05,659
You were almost done. You were one guide super hard.

1059
03:27:05,659 --> 03:27:09,620
Really? You got one

1060
03:27:09,620 --> 03:27:14,809
guide. Where's this lady?

1061
03:27:14,809 --> 03:27:34,760
She's not even here.

1062
03:27:34,760 --> 03:27:40,069
At least see the monster.

1063
03:27:40,069 --> 03:27:42,069
I'll at least see what the monster is.

1064
03:27:42,069 --> 03:27:44,440
And then I'm going to take another quick break.

1065
03:27:44,440 --> 03:27:46,440
Come back and we'll do the boxing game for a little while.

1066
03:27:46,440 --> 03:27:49,450
Alright, let's go see the monster.

1067
03:27:49,450 --> 03:28:35,079
No, I'll look it up on YouTube.

1068
03:28:35,079 --> 03:28:37,079
I'm going to YouTube it.

1069
03:28:37,079 --> 03:28:45,530
It's so quiet. I'll look it up on YouTube.

1070
03:28:45,530 --> 03:29:23,780
No, I'll look it up on YouTube.

1071
03:29:23,780 --> 03:29:25,780
Right around this corner.

1072
03:29:25,780 --> 03:29:27,780
Pretend I'm on a YouTube video.

1073
03:29:27,780 --> 03:29:32,709
I'm on a YouTube VR video.

1074
03:29:32,709 --> 03:29:34,709
I don't know what it is. Is it in here?

1075
03:29:55,239 --> 03:29:58,379
I got

1076
03:29:58,379 --> 03:30:00,739
this

1077
03:30:00,739 --> 03:30:02,739
I can't

1078
03:30:02,739 --> 03:30:05,110
I can't

1079
03:30:05,110 --> 03:30:07,110
I can't do it.

1080
03:30:07,110 --> 03:30:09,110
I can't

1081
03:30:09,110 --> 03:30:24,469
I can't do it.

1082
03:30:24,469 --> 03:30:29,979
It's so big.

1083
03:30:29,979 --> 03:30:31,979
Why did you wake us?

1084
03:30:31,979 --> 03:30:35,239
We must speak

1085
03:30:35,239 --> 03:30:37,239
when you bring payment.

1086
03:30:37,239 --> 03:30:39,239
Those are the rules, and we will follow them.

1087
03:30:39,239 --> 03:30:41,239
But we are not here for your

1088
03:30:41,239 --> 03:30:43,239
amusement, Wanderer.

1089
03:30:43,239 --> 03:30:47,340
It's fucking fantastic.

1090
03:30:47,340 --> 03:30:49,829
Here we go.

1091
03:30:49,829 --> 03:30:52,200
I'm ready. Let's go. Come on.

1092
03:30:52,200 --> 03:31:08,489
One more.

1093
03:31:08,489 --> 03:31:10,489
What's the gimmick for this new guy?

1094
03:31:10,489 --> 03:31:19,559
What's the gimmick for the new guy?

1095
03:31:19,559 --> 03:31:21,739
What's the gimmick for the new guy?

1096
03:31:21,739 --> 03:31:27,940
That's how I see red.

1097
03:31:27,940 --> 03:31:30,309
What does that mean?

1098
03:31:30,309 --> 03:31:36,500
Oh shit.

1099
03:31:36,500 --> 03:31:38,500
He's attracted to light. Why did you just tell me to do that?

1100
03:31:38,500 --> 03:31:43,180
What the hell is that guy?

1101
03:31:43,180 --> 03:31:45,180
How do I blow it out?

1102
03:31:45,180 --> 03:32:01,420
Do I have to stand still?

1103
03:32:01,420 --> 03:32:03,420
Jesus Christ.

1104
03:32:03,420 --> 03:32:07,579
Dog.

1105
03:32:07,579 --> 03:32:09,579
Is it a dog?

1106
03:32:09,579 --> 03:32:11,579
It's the dog, isn't it?

1107
03:32:11,579 --> 03:32:14,069
Is it the dog?

1108
03:32:14,069 --> 03:32:19,260
Yeah, it is. What?

1109
03:32:19,260 --> 03:32:21,260
Be in here.

1110
03:32:21,260 --> 03:32:24,500
Be in here.

1111
03:32:29,059 --> 03:32:36,040
I'm regressing.

1112
03:32:36,040 --> 03:32:40,889
I'm regressing.

1113
03:32:40,889 --> 03:32:43,579
I don't even know what it said.

1114
03:32:43,579 --> 03:32:47,100
I have no idea. We gotta go.

1115
03:32:47,100 --> 03:32:49,100
I'm just regressing to noises and shit.

1116
03:32:49,100 --> 03:32:53,510
I'm gone forever.

1117
03:32:53,510 --> 03:32:55,510
Right through this door. You gotta be in here.

1118
03:33:10,149 --> 03:33:16,489
Let's see what this lady has to say.

1119
03:33:16,489 --> 03:33:18,489
Oh no. Oh no.

1120
03:33:18,489 --> 03:33:20,489
Shut. What?

1121
03:33:20,489 --> 03:33:22,979
Don't leave me alone.

1122
03:33:22,979 --> 03:33:24,979
What's this say?

1123
03:33:24,979 --> 03:33:26,979
An ear piercing scream suddenly filled the dungeon without us sleeping.

1124
03:33:26,979 --> 03:33:28,979
It took me a few seconds to realize it was mine.

1125
03:33:28,979 --> 03:33:30,979
Get off the screen.

1126
03:33:30,979 --> 03:33:34,819
Look at how far away this took me. I don't care.

1127
03:33:34,819 --> 03:33:36,819
Son of a bitch.

1128
03:33:36,819 --> 03:33:39,190
Procedurally random generated.

1129
03:33:39,190 --> 03:33:57,620
Do these things attack?

1130
03:33:57,620 --> 03:34:02,680
One, two, three, go.

1131
03:34:02,680 --> 03:34:15,610
I woke up. Who cares?

1132
03:34:15,610 --> 03:34:28,920
Give me the eye.

1133
03:34:28,920 --> 03:34:30,920
I've gone so far around this whole damn thing.

1134
03:34:32,920 --> 03:34:45,270
Oh no, it's the dog.

1135
03:34:45,270 --> 03:34:51,350
But where is it?

1136
03:34:51,350 --> 03:34:54,489
Which way is the dog?

1137
03:35:24,700 --> 03:35:29,479
You stupid lady.

1138
03:35:29,479 --> 03:35:44,389
Fucking close.

1139
03:35:44,389 --> 03:35:56,870
I gotta be close.

1140
03:35:56,870 --> 03:36:01,610
It's the lady.

1141
03:36:01,610 --> 03:36:06,149
Come on, look at this shit.

1142
03:36:06,149 --> 03:36:09,350
Oh no.

1143
03:36:09,350 --> 03:36:13,450
I gotta go to the left,

1144
03:36:13,450 --> 03:36:16,520
and then out, and then right.

1145
03:36:16,520 --> 03:36:33,379
Is she here? The lady.

1146
03:36:33,379 --> 03:36:35,879
How did he get in there?

1147
03:36:35,879 --> 03:36:38,569
He can go down there? Not even possible.

1148
03:36:38,569 --> 03:36:40,569
Oh my god.

1149
03:36:40,569 --> 03:36:42,569
It's not the dog, it's that guy.

1150
03:36:42,569 --> 03:36:44,569
It's that bad guy. He looks like a fucking goat.

1151
03:36:44,569 --> 03:36:46,569
Okay.

1152
03:36:46,569 --> 03:36:51,110
End this.

1153
03:36:51,110 --> 03:36:53,110
End this.

1154
03:36:53,110 --> 03:37:04,700
Oh shit.

1155
03:37:04,700 --> 03:37:08,149
It's up there.

1156
03:37:08,149 --> 03:37:10,149
Oh fuck off, will ya?

1157
03:37:10,149 --> 03:37:12,149
Look at how much of this. I beat it, I win.

1158
03:37:12,149 --> 03:37:16,700
Hello?

1159
03:37:16,700 --> 03:37:20,020
Should I not have done that?

1160
03:37:20,020 --> 03:37:24,120
I maybe should not have done that.

1161
03:37:24,120 --> 03:37:28,280
What's the fastest way for me to get there?

1162
03:37:28,280 --> 03:37:30,780
Bang up right, and then bang up right.

1163
03:37:30,780 --> 03:37:37,459
Straighten.

1164
03:37:37,459 --> 03:37:39,459
Motherfucker, just pretend I beat it.

1165
03:37:39,459 --> 03:37:43,930
I don't know what it is.

1166
03:37:43,930 --> 03:37:45,930
That's a thing!

1167
03:37:45,930 --> 03:37:49,639
What is that thing? I don't know!

1168
03:37:49,639 --> 03:37:51,819
Should I stop moving?

1169
03:37:51,819 --> 03:38:01,780
I don't know what it is, I'm just gonna die.

1170
03:38:01,780 --> 03:38:10,100
Go!

1171
03:38:10,100 --> 03:38:12,100
Fuck you!

1172
03:38:12,100 --> 03:38:14,100
You can't do this to me.

1173
03:38:14,100 --> 03:38:16,100
You can't do this to me.

1174
03:38:16,100 --> 03:38:23,129
How close I am.

1175
03:38:23,129 --> 03:38:25,430
One little bit, right here.

1176
03:38:25,430 --> 03:38:31,000
Oh my god, I win. I beat the game.

1177
03:38:31,000 --> 03:38:33,430
Open!

1178
03:38:33,430 --> 03:38:39,510
Open?

1179
03:38:39,510 --> 03:38:49,860
Jesus.

1180
03:38:49,860 --> 03:38:57,799
I stuck it through when I did it.

1181
03:38:57,799 --> 03:38:59,799
That's the end.

1182
03:38:59,799 --> 03:39:01,799
I'll see the ending cutscene, please.

1183
03:39:01,799 --> 03:39:03,799
Hey, the ending cutscene.

1184
03:39:03,799 --> 03:39:21,139
Give it to me.

1185
03:39:21,139 --> 03:39:37,639
I hope this is the end.

1186
03:39:37,639 --> 03:39:45,000
Is this not it?

1187
03:39:45,000 --> 03:39:48,579
I thought this was it.

1188
03:39:48,579 --> 03:40:16,940
Is it an eyeball?

1189
03:40:16,940 --> 03:40:24,809
I thought you guessed it was the end of the game.

1190
03:40:24,809 --> 03:40:44,200
Is this supposed to be like a cutscene?

1191
03:40:44,200 --> 03:40:46,200
Like the ending cutscene?

1192
03:40:46,200 --> 03:40:48,760
I don't know.

1193
03:40:48,760 --> 03:40:59,000
I mean, it looks pretty linear.

1194
03:41:01,010 --> 03:41:06,639
Only two more.

1195
03:41:06,639 --> 03:41:08,639
New hub, two more, two more.

1196
03:41:08,639 --> 03:41:18,610
No, I gotta get out of that.

1197
03:41:18,610 --> 03:41:22,510
That game is a ton of fun and it's so stressful.

1198
03:41:22,510 --> 03:41:24,510
But, I can't do that anymore.

1199
03:41:24,510 --> 03:41:29,870
It's gonna actually kill me.

1200
03:41:29,870 --> 03:41:36,209
So we're gonna move on.

1201
03:41:36,209 --> 03:41:38,209
We're probably gonna end on...

1202
03:41:38,209 --> 03:41:40,209
I was gonna play Mind Show, but I don't know if I'm gonna have enough time to do it.

1203
03:41:40,209 --> 03:41:44,280
I feel like I'm gonna have to start with Mind Show.

1204
03:41:44,280 --> 03:41:47,219
Because I've exhausted myself.

1205
03:41:47,219 --> 03:41:52,170
I'm gonna have to start with Mind Show another day.

1206
03:41:53,659 --> 03:41:58,079
No, Mind Show, not Minecraft.

1207
03:41:58,079 --> 03:42:03,520
Let me take another break.

1208
03:42:03,520 --> 03:42:05,520
I'm just gonna get some more water thrown in my face.

1209
03:42:05,520 --> 03:42:11,100
And we'll come back and we might just play the boxing game for like a little while.

1210
03:42:11,100 --> 03:42:16,350
I'll be right back.

1211
03:42:16,350 --> 03:42:21,600
What? Is something in here?

1212
03:42:21,600 --> 03:42:41,299
I don't see anything.

1213
03:42:41,299 --> 03:42:46,989
Alright, I'll see you guys in a minute.

1214
03:42:46,989 --> 03:42:48,989
I can't leave up track to the game.

1215
03:42:48,989 --> 03:46:42,319
Okay. Hello again.

1216
03:46:42,319 --> 03:46:48,659
We are now gonna jump into...

1217
03:46:48,659 --> 03:46:52,049
Oh, let's see.

1218
03:46:52,049 --> 03:46:57,209
Something like easy and relaxing.

1219
03:46:57,209 --> 03:47:05,120
Although I'm not entirely sure that the boxing game will be very relaxing.

1220
03:47:05,120 --> 03:47:12,659
Let's do it.

1221
03:47:12,659 --> 03:47:18,670
What the hell is it there? It's Creed.

1222
03:47:18,670 --> 03:47:33,520
This looks really fun, actually.

1223
03:47:33,520 --> 03:47:39,170
I can't even remember what I was even saying during that stream.

1224
03:47:39,170 --> 03:47:42,170
Hopefully that was an interesting experience for all of you.

1225
03:47:42,170 --> 03:47:49,209
Have I done Superhot? Yeah, I did a Superhot VR last week.

1226
03:47:49,209 --> 03:47:54,649
Let's try Creed.

1227
03:47:54,649 --> 03:48:04,420
Alright, going back in.

1228
03:48:06,879 --> 03:48:09,180
What's the battery life on these things?

1229
03:48:09,180 --> 03:48:18,659
Should I turn the lights back up?

1230
03:48:18,659 --> 03:48:22,940
I probably should.

1231
03:48:22,940 --> 03:48:26,340
Let me turn the lights on.

1232
03:48:26,340 --> 03:48:39,059
A bit higher than they are now. That's better.

1233
03:48:39,059 --> 03:48:48,979
That looks good.

1234
03:48:48,979 --> 03:48:51,979
So I heard this game is pretty realistic.

1235
03:48:51,979 --> 03:48:53,979
It really feels like you're fighting.

1236
03:48:53,979 --> 03:49:00,760
Press any button to calibrate.

1237
03:49:00,760 --> 03:49:23,270
So press any button to calibrate.

1238
03:49:23,270 --> 03:49:25,270
What the fuck?

1239
03:49:25,270 --> 03:49:28,149
That's not correct.

1240
03:49:28,149 --> 03:49:31,799
That doesn't look right.

1241
03:49:31,799 --> 03:49:36,459
Hold on. What happened there?

1242
03:49:36,459 --> 03:49:43,659
Stop stream. End of the stream.

1243
03:49:43,659 --> 03:49:48,270
I think that's better.

1244
03:49:48,270 --> 03:49:52,500
Hey, look. There we go.

1245
03:49:52,500 --> 03:49:59,200
This is also pretty wild.

1246
03:49:59,200 --> 03:50:02,659
Ok. Alright.

1247
03:50:02,659 --> 03:50:04,659
Career. Free play. Options.

1248
03:50:04,659 --> 03:50:06,659
Am I standing in a good spot?

1249
03:50:06,659 --> 03:50:10,479
Ok.

1250
03:50:10,479 --> 03:50:12,479
Gameplay. Graphics. Gameplay. Comfort mode.

1251
03:50:12,479 --> 03:50:14,479
On. Reset profile. Advanced.

1252
03:50:14,479 --> 03:50:17,420
Local motion. What does that mean?

1253
03:50:17,420 --> 03:50:29,010
Yeah, I know it's times two. Don't worry.

1254
03:50:29,010 --> 03:50:42,559
Gameplay. Let's just go through it.

1255
03:50:42,559 --> 03:50:47,040
Career. Pro.

1256
03:50:47,040 --> 03:50:56,180
I probably should change the title too. I didn't.

1257
03:50:56,180 --> 03:50:58,610
Delta Gym.

1258
03:50:58,610 --> 03:51:00,610
Seven months before underground championship.

1259
03:51:00,610 --> 03:51:03,299
Oh, this is cool.

1260
03:51:03,299 --> 03:51:05,299
I thought that was me.

1261
03:51:05,299 --> 03:51:08,049
Actually me.

1262
03:51:08,049 --> 03:51:10,049
Hold the trackpad while swinging your arms.

1263
03:51:10,049 --> 03:51:17,790
Ok.

1264
03:51:17,790 --> 03:51:22,979
Anything else you'd like to tell me?

1265
03:51:22,979 --> 03:51:28,420
Oh. Punch.

1266
03:51:28,420 --> 03:51:36,479
Punch harder for more damage.

1267
03:51:36,479 --> 03:51:49,280
Harder than that.

1268
03:51:51,280 --> 03:51:53,280
These are going to fly off.

1269
03:51:55,709 --> 03:51:57,889
This is kind of cutting off circulation.

1270
03:51:57,889 --> 03:51:59,889
How am I using a cell phone with these on?

1271
03:51:59,889 --> 03:52:01,889
Come on in.

1272
03:52:01,889 --> 03:52:03,889
Teach me.

1273
03:52:03,889 --> 03:52:13,469
Hey, there he is.

1274
03:52:13,469 --> 03:52:16,100
Let me show you what I can do.

1275
03:52:16,100 --> 03:52:18,340
Huh?

1276
03:52:18,340 --> 03:52:20,829
I just used all my energy.

1277
03:52:20,829 --> 03:52:23,200
I don't think I can even make it over there.

1278
03:52:23,200 --> 03:52:25,200
What? Oh.

1279
03:52:25,200 --> 03:52:32,620
Ok. Hold on.

1280
03:52:32,620 --> 03:52:34,620
Whoa.

1281
03:52:34,620 --> 03:52:45,809
Let's go. Train me.

1282
03:52:45,809 --> 03:52:48,500
Hey, Bonham.

1283
03:52:48,500 --> 03:52:50,500
Hey, Bonham.

1284
03:52:50,500 --> 03:52:52,500
I got to tie this.

1285
03:52:52,500 --> 03:52:54,799
This is going to be tighter.

1286
03:52:54,799 --> 03:52:58,959
I'm going to move around so much this is going to be bad.

1287
03:52:58,959 --> 03:53:10,930
This is going to fly off my head.

1288
03:53:10,930 --> 03:53:13,360
Ok. Defend with gloves.

1289
03:53:13,360 --> 03:53:15,360
Sounds easy enough.

1290
03:53:15,360 --> 03:53:22,399
Dodge punches to trigger slow-mo.

1291
03:53:22,399 --> 03:53:24,399
I'm going to see you guys every time.

1292
03:53:24,399 --> 03:53:27,469
Dodge punches to trigger slow-mo.

1293
03:53:32,219 --> 03:53:34,219
Do I have enough room?

1294
03:53:34,219 --> 03:53:36,219
I will break something here.

1295
03:53:38,219 --> 03:53:40,979
Finish exercise as quick as possible.

1296
03:53:40,979 --> 03:53:42,979
Ok.

1297
03:53:42,979 --> 03:53:45,540
Stand in the center of your play space.

1298
03:53:45,540 --> 03:53:50,909
While counting down.

1299
03:53:50,909 --> 03:53:54,819
Rapidly hit the target.

1300
03:53:54,819 --> 03:54:03,819
Swing.

1301
03:54:03,819 --> 03:54:09,200
This is like happening too fast.

1302
03:54:09,200 --> 03:54:36,260
Did I do good?

1303
03:54:36,260 --> 03:54:41,819
Come on. Bring it on.

1304
03:54:41,819 --> 03:54:43,819
I wanted a relaxing game.

1305
03:54:43,819 --> 03:54:54,379
Ten exceptions to training.

1306
03:54:54,379 --> 03:54:56,379
Training determines stamina.

1307
03:54:58,379 --> 03:55:00,379
Hands are slower and weaker while tired.

1308
03:55:00,379 --> 03:55:02,379
Punching consumes stamina.

1309
03:55:04,379 --> 03:55:07,579
Keep hands still to recover stamina.

1310
03:55:07,579 --> 03:55:11,870
Not enough oxygen is going into his brain.

1311
03:55:11,870 --> 03:55:16,739
I'm fine. Don't worry.

1312
03:55:16,739 --> 03:55:26,850
First combatant.

1313
03:55:26,850 --> 03:55:30,860
Do you think you're going to take on me?

1314
03:55:30,860 --> 03:55:33,549
He's 0-12.

1315
03:55:33,549 --> 03:55:36,690
Well, what do you got?

1316
03:55:36,690 --> 03:55:41,739
Huh?

1317
03:55:41,739 --> 03:55:46,139
You're going to rip that off the bottom of your chin.

1318
03:55:49,020 --> 03:55:51,020
Keep this above the belt and inside the ring.

1319
03:55:51,020 --> 03:55:53,020
The fight starts as soon as you touch gloves.

1320
03:55:53,020 --> 03:55:55,520
Ok.

1321
03:55:55,520 --> 03:55:58,530
As soon as we touch gloves.

1322
03:56:35,360 --> 03:56:40,219
I didn't even let him count.

1323
03:56:40,219 --> 03:56:56,739
That's not how you box.

1324
03:56:56,739 --> 03:56:58,739
That's not how you box.

1325
03:57:00,739 --> 03:57:02,739
I would get thrown out of the gym.

1326
03:57:02,739 --> 03:57:04,979
I'm trying to get him in the stomach.

1327
03:57:06,979 --> 03:57:11,329
That's not how I would get tossed.

1328
03:57:11,329 --> 03:57:32,690
Dammit.

1329
03:57:32,690 --> 03:57:38,239
He's done.

1330
03:57:38,239 --> 03:57:41,059
He's out.

1331
03:58:10,750 --> 03:58:14,139
How is he going to go out?

1332
03:58:14,139 --> 03:58:32,579
What?

1333
03:58:32,579 --> 03:58:40,579
Whoa, what did I hit?

1334
03:58:42,579 --> 03:58:45,329
I'm going to go for the legs.

1335
03:59:04,139 --> 03:59:14,579
Where am I going?

1336
03:59:14,579 --> 03:59:16,579
I just beat the shit out of his head.

1337
03:59:16,579 --> 03:59:39,409
5.

1338
03:59:39,409 --> 03:59:47,020
Fuck you.

1339
03:59:47,020 --> 03:59:49,579
You want to come fuck with me?

1340
03:59:49,579 --> 03:59:57,059
Don't wake that up.

1341
03:59:57,059 --> 04:00:07,020
Label.

1342
04:00:07,020 --> 04:00:15,149
I did it.

1343
04:00:15,149 --> 04:00:18,100
This trip is tired.

1344
04:00:18,100 --> 04:00:21,489
I am.

1345
04:00:21,489 --> 04:00:25,459
Come on, I need this exercise though.

1346
04:00:25,459 --> 04:00:27,629
That was fucking funny.

1347
04:00:27,629 --> 04:00:29,629
I showed that motherfucker who's boss.

1348
04:00:29,629 --> 04:00:34,620
Yeah.

1349
04:00:34,620 --> 04:00:43,010
Where?

1350
04:00:58,690 --> 04:01:00,690
Okay.

1351
04:01:00,690 --> 04:01:02,690
Dodge, punch the bag without missing.

1352
04:01:02,690 --> 04:01:04,690
Dodge when ball glows red.

1353
04:01:04,690 --> 04:01:15,760
Okay.

1354
04:01:15,760 --> 04:01:35,139
I win.

1355
04:01:35,139 --> 04:01:40,510
Hey.

1356
04:01:40,510 --> 04:01:50,620
Alright, let's go.

1357
04:01:50,620 --> 04:01:52,620
You and me in the ring.

1358
04:01:52,620 --> 04:01:55,889
Why is it counting?

1359
04:01:55,889 --> 04:01:59,020
What are you doing?

1360
04:01:59,020 --> 04:02:09,520
This has been the longest 3 seconds ever.

1361
04:02:09,520 --> 04:02:16,420
What the fuck?

1362
04:02:16,420 --> 04:02:46,799
Alright, come on.

1363
04:02:46,799 --> 04:02:48,799
I've done training. Let me fight the next guy.

1364
04:02:48,799 --> 04:03:01,780
Alright, go.

1365
04:03:01,780 --> 04:03:03,780
I don't care. I'll take 3 out of 5.

1366
04:03:06,270 --> 04:03:08,270
I will take the same rating as a pizza hut.

1367
04:03:08,270 --> 04:03:12,879
That's alright with me.

1368
04:03:12,879 --> 04:03:17,940
Yeah, begin fight. Let's go.

1369
04:03:17,940 --> 04:03:29,059
Who's next?

1370
04:03:29,059 --> 04:03:36,540
Come on. You're next.

1371
04:03:36,540 --> 04:03:39,299
In fact, you know what? Fuck this.

1372
04:03:39,299 --> 04:03:50,819
Oh, that's a guy I gotta fight.

1373
04:03:50,819 --> 04:03:53,500
This is not a thesis guy that has knockouts.

1374
04:03:53,500 --> 04:03:55,500
That's me.

1375
04:03:55,500 --> 04:04:09,760
Give me that fucking mic.

1376
04:04:09,760 --> 04:04:11,760
I got something to say.

1377
04:04:29,139 --> 04:04:49,489
Why would I do that?

1378
04:04:49,489 --> 04:04:51,489
Ooh, right in the face.

1379
04:04:51,489 --> 04:05:08,819
Get down.

1380
04:05:08,819 --> 04:05:23,389
Uh oh, easy.

1381
04:05:23,389 --> 04:05:26,020
Oh shit. What do I do?

1382
04:05:38,430 --> 04:05:40,430
I keep on getting knocked out.

1383
04:05:40,430 --> 04:05:42,430
Over and over again.

1384
04:05:42,430 --> 04:05:48,260
I get knocked out like 6 times.

1385
04:05:48,260 --> 04:06:20,500
What's wrong with my leg?

1386
04:06:42,940 --> 04:06:50,299
Oh, right in the fucking head.

1387
04:06:54,139 --> 04:06:58,500
Shit, I'm losing audio.

1388
04:07:02,079 --> 04:07:14,989
Hold on, I gotta put my head back.

1389
04:07:14,989 --> 04:07:16,989
Put my head back.

1390
04:07:16,989 --> 04:07:19,229
Put my head back.

1391
04:07:21,600 --> 04:07:23,899
It's time to play defensively.

1392
04:07:23,899 --> 04:07:44,430
I got him.

1393
04:07:44,430 --> 04:08:03,420
You're dead motherfucker.

1394
04:08:07,200 --> 04:08:09,200
Ah, I shattered my leg.

1395
04:08:15,709 --> 04:08:30,879
I was being a dick and I broke my leg in half.

1396
04:08:30,879 --> 04:08:35,920
Oh man.

1397
04:08:35,920 --> 04:08:37,920
I'm gonna be so sloppy in the next fight.

1398
04:08:37,920 --> 04:08:39,920
This is not fair.

1399
04:08:39,920 --> 04:08:42,610
Typical.

1400
04:08:42,610 --> 04:08:44,610
Typically you should fight in a boxing match.

1401
04:08:44,610 --> 04:08:46,610
You don't fight again 10 minutes later.

1402
04:08:46,610 --> 04:08:48,979
It takes like 6 months to recover.

1403
04:08:48,979 --> 04:09:04,639
Whatever.

1404
04:09:04,639 --> 04:09:07,520
What do you got for me?

1405
04:09:10,399 --> 04:09:12,399
More training?

1406
04:09:12,399 --> 04:09:14,399
Oh god.

1407
04:09:14,399 --> 04:09:16,700
Okay, I gotta...

1408
04:09:16,700 --> 04:09:19,010
Alright.

1409
04:09:19,010 --> 04:09:27,250
Alright, scan him.

1410
04:09:27,250 --> 04:09:40,030
You can't do it.

1411
04:09:40,030 --> 04:09:42,270
Hang on.

1412
04:09:42,270 --> 04:09:49,739
You're gonna kill me.

1413
04:09:49,739 --> 04:09:51,739
Don't have like a McDonald's rating.

1414
04:09:51,739 --> 04:09:54,049
That's all I care about.

1415
04:09:54,049 --> 04:09:56,049
No McDonald's rating and I'll be fine.

1416
04:10:03,629 --> 04:10:05,629
I have to have a better fucking local McDonald's.

1417
04:10:21,299 --> 04:10:27,569
Ah, shit.

1418
04:10:27,569 --> 04:10:29,569
I gotta do a new tactic on this next fight.

1419
04:10:32,299 --> 04:10:34,299
Here's the new tactic, you'll see.

1420
04:10:34,299 --> 04:10:38,530
Guaranteed victory.

1421
04:10:38,530 --> 04:10:40,530
I'm gonna Toy Story this fucking guy coming up.

1422
04:10:40,530 --> 04:10:51,280
Oh no, this is like a championship fight.

1423
04:10:51,280 --> 04:10:59,020
Oh shit.

1424
04:10:59,020 --> 04:11:01,649
This guy's huge.

1425
04:11:01,649 --> 04:11:10,979
Dwayne Reynolds.

1426
04:11:10,979 --> 04:11:12,979
He's 29 and 0.

1427
04:11:12,979 --> 04:11:20,510
Okay.

1428
04:11:20,510 --> 04:11:24,159
Here we go.

1429
04:11:24,159 --> 04:11:26,590
Oh boy.

1430
04:11:26,590 --> 04:11:31,579
Okay.

1431
04:11:31,579 --> 04:11:33,579
We got it.

1432
04:11:35,579 --> 04:11:39,280
Good luck.

1433
04:11:39,280 --> 04:11:42,159
Just wanna say, I respect you.

1434
04:11:42,159 --> 04:11:44,159
And I think you're a very good fighter.

1435
04:11:44,159 --> 04:11:46,159
And I've been looking up to you for a long time.

1436
04:12:20,590 --> 04:12:22,590
This would be the worst fight you could ever go to.

1437
04:12:22,590 --> 04:12:24,590
This would be embarrassing.

1438
04:12:24,590 --> 04:13:05,729
Work on the body.

1439
04:13:05,729 --> 04:13:14,989
Whoa, what?

1440
04:13:14,989 --> 04:13:19,409
I knocked him out.

1441
04:13:19,409 --> 04:13:25,340

Where the hell have you been?

1444
04:14:18,829 --> 04:14:32,000
I don't know how to dodge that.

1445
04:15:18,979 --> 04:15:23,709
No, come here.

1446
04:15:23,709 --> 04:15:30,030
No.

1447
04:15:45,489 --> 04:16:10,620
He's gonna get up.

1448
04:16:10,620 --> 04:16:15,659
He's gonna get up.

1449
04:16:15,659 --> 04:16:22,430
I'll get you this time.

1450
04:16:22,430 --> 04:16:25,120
Starting the fight on your back.

1451
04:16:25,120 --> 04:16:30,860
Starting the fight on your back.

1452
04:16:30,860 --> 04:16:32,860
No, I'll be fine.

1453
04:16:32,860 --> 04:16:35,870
I'll be fine.

1454
04:16:35,870 --> 04:16:37,870
Just give me a second.

1455
04:16:57,299 --> 04:16:59,659
Yes, that's me.

1456
04:17:09,149 --> 04:17:19,649
Alright.

1457
04:17:19,649 --> 04:17:21,649

04:17:21,649 --> 04:17:23,649

1459
04:17:23,649 --> 04:17:27,360
You and me.

1460
04:17:27,360 --> 04:17:55,969
There's this guy.

1461
04:17:55,969 --> 04:17:57,969
I'm gonna puke.

1462
04:17:57,969 --> 04:17:59,969
How do I grab? Can I grab him?

1463
04:17:59,969 --> 04:18:07,379
Come here.

1464
04:18:07,379 --> 04:18:11,790
Whoa, what?

1465
04:18:11,790 --> 04:18:16,139
Oh, am I supposed to be at my desk?

1466
04:18:16,139 --> 04:18:27,520
You know, it's too tired.

1467
04:18:27,520 --> 04:18:29,520
I can't.

1468
04:18:29,520 --> 04:18:33,280
He's been beaten up too many times.

1469
04:18:33,280 --> 04:18:38,659
He's been punched too many times in the face.

1470
04:18:40,659 --> 04:18:44,620
And so that's what I told him.

1471
04:18:44,620 --> 04:18:46,620
Like, oh, you're gonna go to the grocery store without me?

1472
04:18:46,620 --> 04:18:48,620
Make sure you pick up some Pringles.

1473
04:18:48,620 --> 04:18:50,620
You know what I'm saying?

1474
04:18:50,620 --> 04:18:55,149
God.

1475
04:18:55,149 --> 04:19:02,129
There's gotta be a strategy I can do here.

1476
04:19:19,899 --> 04:19:24,770
Check's activated!

1477
04:20:06,739 --> 04:20:15,299
Get out!

1478
04:20:15,299 --> 04:20:58,399

1479
04:20:58,399 --> 04:21:07,409

04:21:58,989 --> 04:22:38,780
Alright.

1482
04:22:38,780 --> 04:22:43,760
Get back to the gym.

1483
04:22:43,760 --> 04:22:54,239
Maybe I'll put this over here for a

1484
04:22:54,239 --> 04:22:57,440
just a moment.

1485
04:22:57,440 --> 04:23:10,100
Put this over here.

1486
04:23:10,100 --> 04:23:12,100
One sip of soda is not hydration.

1487
04:23:12,100 --> 04:23:14,100
I'm alright.

1488
04:23:14,100 --> 04:23:18,620
I'll get some water.

1489
04:23:18,620 --> 04:23:20,620
I'll get some real water.

1490
04:23:24,399 --> 04:23:27,790
Let's go, hey, let's go play a

1491
04:23:27,790 --> 04:23:29,790
