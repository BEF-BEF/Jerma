1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,849
Split. Well, um, I mean, yeah, I could have done that. You're right. You are. You are correct. I could have absolutely could have done that.

2
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:50,289
I can't tell if this is the beginning of the game or if this is I don't know. Is this the beginning of the game?

3
00:00:53,950 --> 00:01:06,260
Does anybody know where's the oh, there it is. This is where I left off. All right, good

4
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:08,500
We did it

5
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,939
We did a little pivot to hit man and threw some grenades at people and I went back to the quiet man

6
00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:25,680
I just backed up into that guy and I heard him. Is the audio yeah

7
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,719
We have to explain to everybody again that the audio is like all fucked up

8
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:38,500
Yeah, see we had two hours of quiet man and then two hours of hitman and then like now two hours of quiet man

9
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,500
No, this this sucked. You should play hitman again

10
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,900
YouTube auto

11
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,659
No

12
00:01:55,659 --> 00:02:06,099
No, let's just get through this game. I can't believe i'm still watching this

13
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:09,039
Don't you want to see how it ends?

14
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,879
We need to see how this ends

15
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:19,580
I feel like I was just in like a time warp

16
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,830
I just had like a hitman dream for an hour and 40 minutes

17
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,710
Still says i'm playing hitman. Oh fuck. I got a chance. This guy's not even functioning

18
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:45,389
I should get the quiet man's haircut. I already had it. It was great

19
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:52,530
God damn it. Don't do this to me. No

20
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:57,300
Not now don't do this to me now. Don't do this to me now

21
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:09,819
Okay, I fixed him. They can't be more than like 30 minutes in this game, right? They can't be

22
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,479
Golden this did not win a golden joystick award. No way

23
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:28,590
It did not

24
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,599
It did not it did not

25
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:50,080
What do I have to do? Please consider using youtube autoplay

26
00:03:54,509 --> 00:03:56,509
uh

27
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:24,019
No, I can't get up 18 percent liked this game

28
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,709
All right. Here's the question. Do you think the viewer is going to go up or down?

29
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:39,439
What do you think?

30
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:41,439
Your viewers are going to triple

31
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:44,529
Well, it's been going down

32
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,370
Uh

33
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:55,350
Hey, well, by the way, germany is this weekend if anyone was curious. Hope you have a happy thanksgiving

34
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:08,620
It still says hitman 2. Oh, hold on. Let me let me just change that real quick to the quiet man

35
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,990
All right, and then the I changed the title title that makes more sense now, too

36
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:37,199
What is this pause screen? It's it's absolute dog shit. I have no idea why it's like that

37
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:43,779
Yeah, we went back. Yeah, I we we did the we I need to see how the sense we have to be close to the end

38
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,240
Blow up this stuff

39
00:05:50,240 --> 00:06:06,449
Is this shit?

40
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,699
We're almost there

41
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:11,620
There's quite a bit left

42
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:37,620
And they can't be don't worry the fact that here's the crazy part about this the fact that there's no

43
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,540
Not even any any audio besides these muffle punches

44
00:06:43,329 --> 00:06:45,329
And they keep doing this overlay

45
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:50,910
Covering the whole screen superimposing images. We've seen a thousand times already

46
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:55,889
Why do you keep showing us this?

47
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,449
Why do you keep doing that?

48
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:15,709
No, it's gonna explode

49
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:18,110
It's deep you wouldn't you just wouldn't understand

50
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:25,310
Play vacuum cleaner noises

51
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:30,379
Um, am I about to turn on that? No

52
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:48,060
I already did this

53
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,480
How about we just like learn how to speak a different language? How does that sound?

54
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,360
Let's get like rosetta stone

55
00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:03,839
Rosetta stone. Uh, what language do I want to learn? I'm gonna I'll have a

We can't put like, uh, what's the one from lord of the rings? What's the one from lord of the

74
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:49,009
This is making me laugh so hard

75
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:00,350
Okay

76
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,350

00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:05,889
121 to 132

82
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,190
People are gonna get so confused

83
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:15,470
They're gonna come to the stream. They're gonna be like, why is he doing this? Just

84
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:24,019
Is there any reason why he's learning a language and playing this shitty game? All right, we got

85
00:11:28,049 --> 00:11:31,730
All right, it's you got you got you get 60 seconds here

86
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:47,340
Now I think it's getting closed

87
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,340
Oh, man. All right

88
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:56,509
I think that's it

89
00:11:56,509 --> 00:11:59,230
Yeah, it looks like it looks like we're gonna learn elvish

90
00:11:59,789 --> 00:12:10,850
Uh, we can learn both

91
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,850
Let's learn elvish and then english

92
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:22,159
Okay, how thank you for voting polls close we're gonna do elvish in english how to speak elvish

93
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,990
Oh my god. Okay

94
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,740
Basic vowels learn to speak basic elvish

95
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:38,220
All right. This one is this video is basic

96
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:48,990
These are vowels

97
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:55,500
Let's see

98
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,250
Okay, let's give it a try i'm willing to learn

99
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:05,679
Okay, here we go

100
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:12,460
I thought that in my channel, you know, i've been using some elvish words and

101
00:13:13,179 --> 00:13:19,019
Perhaps it's time that I actually tell you what they mean and teach you a little bit so that you understand

102
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:26,139
What I am saying when I do my videos, I guess I jumped right in thinking that most people who would find my channel

103
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,820
Would already know

104
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,580
But if you haven't

105
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:34,539
Discovered elvish language then I will teach you a little bit. That's what we're here for

106
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,860
So let's start at the very beginning

107
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:43,580
So what you have to know is that the vowel sounds

108
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:50,299
Um sound so the a e i o u and then that will allow you to be able to pronounce words

109
00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:56,220
So for a's it's always a long a so it has the sound of

110
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,460
Ah

111
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:06,620
So whenever you see a word that has a in it you can sound it out by using ah

112
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:09,980
So a is a

113
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,340
Next vowel we have is e and it's always a short e

114
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,820
and the word

115
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,620
The word that you can think of to get that sound is

116
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:23,259
Elephant or so l e is l so it's that

117
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,700
L

118
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:30,539
And if you don't know what a long and short vowel is, um, the long makes that long face. Ah

119
00:14:31,419 --> 00:14:33,019
short is

120
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:36,860
And you can tell the difference in the way that you position your mouth. Okay, so

121
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,019
So everything is a and ah so far

122
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:47,740
And then the next vowel is i and that is a short i so it has that so it has

123
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:49,899
In

124
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,220
So i is

125
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:59,019
The i sound like that so if you find a word

126
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:08,139
Like mean mean lots of different, uh words actually have i's in them and so you're always going to have that short i

127
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,379
sound

128
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:12,379
Then the next vowel is o

129
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:20,139
Octopus

130
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:23,019
And then we have

131
00:15:23,419 --> 00:15:26,860
You i'm not the birds. I don't have a bird here

132
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,980
Unicorn and glue glue

133
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,340
So it's always like a kind of sound you you you

134
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:47,100
So hopefully that will that's actually very informative

135
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,259
Announcing some of the elvish words and names

136
00:15:52,059 --> 00:15:56,860
Okay, so let's start out with the very first thing that I always say in my videos, which is

137
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,860
My

138
00:16:04,299 --> 00:16:07,419
Which means well met my friend sometimes I just say my

139
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:15,259
Friend but if you put that wait, I missed a reveal. This is a big reveal. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait

140
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:16,539
I missed it

141
00:16:16,539 --> 00:16:18,610
My my

142
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:22,529
It's that ah sound so you always want to end that word with an ah, so

143
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:31,250
But it's that e so together it's my my

144
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:40,450
So just let it flow from your mouth, okay very very

145
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,610
Is that octopus sound and then

146
00:16:46,929 --> 00:16:48,929
Try it with me

147
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:52,850
Very fast

148
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:57,570
Why is the game teaching us elvish and this is all third age

149
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:04,609
Elvish language. This is uh cinderella. So this is all of the walk in a corner, uh type of

150
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:09,490
Uh pronunciations that you would listen to in the lord of the rings

151
00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:14,210
So this is all last stage lord of the rings all of the trilogy

152
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:20,690
This is this is the language that they use because there's a lot of different types of languages quinnia and there's uh,

153
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:27,809
The um cinderan can you believe that there's entire languages based on this game languages, but not this game

154
00:17:28,529 --> 00:17:32,690
It's easier to research the ones that you find in the movie

155
00:17:33,089 --> 00:17:37,569
But it's just really beautiful when you speak it. It's really fun when you start to do it

156
00:17:37,569 --> 00:17:40,049
So just let that flow really easily

157
00:17:40,849 --> 00:17:42,849
Okay

158
00:17:42,849 --> 00:17:49,089
The next one one that I use a lot is hello or hi this quick reading is

159
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:53,009
Then do then do let's say say hello then do

160
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,710
Uniform that then do

161
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,609
Then do then do

162
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,690
very simple

163
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,410
The eh is that short e so that do

164
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,210
then do

165
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,930
And that just means hello

166
00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:12,049
Use some times is

167
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:17,490
And it's just like that you pronounce the unicorn so

168
00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:23,890
Ah that open a like father that's reading

169
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,180
Is another way that you can greet

170
00:18:39,339 --> 00:18:42,140
I greet you. So this is another way to greet. Oh my fucking god

171
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:45,259
We sweet then I greet you

172
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,579

335
00:55:56,369 --> 00:56:00,849
don't care about in the end and they double crossed me for somehow through the beginning

336
00:56:00,849 --> 00:56:04,619
of the game i don't remember what they double crossed me on it or they did it though somebody

337
00:56:04,619 --> 00:56:16,079
was talking like baby talk it was an english uh tutorial that's all i remember because this is

338
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:43,139
one of the main characters here all right come on you can two drunk guys fighting

339
00:56:43,139 --> 00:56:54,110
that's why did i go through him am i even connecting shots on this guy i don't think i

343
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:49,539

344
00:57:51,619 --> 00:57:59,409
there he is

345
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:18,989
it worked

346
00:58:18,989 --> 00:58:21,710
this match is officially underway i never heard the bell ring

347
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:32,530
they never got the door locked and cain why did i just lose that quickly this is like playing a

348
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:36,130
game on a school night and having the sound muted so your parents don't know you're still up yes

349
00:58:36,929 --> 00:58:51,889
okay now the door is locked finally back into the cell and it's cain who goes on the offense

350
00:58:51,889 --> 00:58:57,730
early and perhaps this is no accident understanding what the

351
00:58:58,530 --> 00:59:07,059
lockers maneuvers like that 20 years of destruction for the undertaker looking to

352
00:59:07,059 --> 00:59:14,099
continue it tonight and locking the door now these two oh the door is locked caged inside

353
00:59:14,099 --> 00:59:20,590
hell in a cell and let's not forget cain did to the undertaker back and that just started

354
00:59:21,550 --> 00:59:22,909
oh come on no

355
00:59:26,989 --> 00:59:28,190
here's some destruction

356
00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:37,869
a weakness in his brother the undertaker when the

357
00:59:37,869 --> 00:59:41,389
undertaker showed some type of compassion to sean michaels at wrestlemania

358
00:59:48,739 --> 00:59:51,699
and again this is a different undertaker that we've witnessed

359
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:58,980
there's a couple of weeks ago snake eyes vintage undertaker as he takes cain down

360
01:00:02,659 --> 01:00:10,210
vintage under day oh there's down in a kick out a quick backstory paul bearer had

361
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:16,989
an affair with a woman in the bowels of the funeral home wait what was the dvc oh right cain

362
01:00:17,789 --> 01:00:22,239
they're takering yeah knocked down to his knees after that punch

363
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:30,239
1990 look at cain now with the chair look at the chair oh i don't have a chair don't lose

364
01:00:30,239 --> 01:00:34,639
here but let's humanize this for a moment i mean if the undertaker has ever come to

365
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:40,210
really fitting in a being of the flesh i may attempt that that humanity was revealed to be

366
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:47,039
a lie undertaker and he can't humanize under one of these individuals

367
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:54,699
demon a monster admittedly so cain has lived in his better more celebrated brother's shadow

368
01:00:54,699 --> 01:01:03,420
for years that's what this is all about the father of destruction looking on man who please

369
01:01:11,699 --> 01:01:12,579
what the fuck

370
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:21,309
gravitate back to paul bearer where the fuck am i the fact that the world's heavyweight

371
01:01:21,309 --> 01:01:25,789
championship an accolade that transcends time the same way these two once in a lifetime

372
01:01:25,789 --> 01:01:34,449
superstars will do is hanging in the balance tonight somebody just threw something at the door

373
01:01:35,170 --> 01:01:46,050
under punishing a champion came in the early going got it placing cain's skull hanging over

374
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:50,369
the steel steps that are going to the poop by the undertaker the undertaker will use these

375
01:01:50,369 --> 01:01:55,090
tools of destruction like no one else has ever been able to utilize such carnage

376
01:02:02,769 --> 01:02:03,969
which one is the undertaker

377
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:15,780
it's now 20 feet high and this in perspective this is the 11th time

378
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:20,900
undertakers participated in this matchup the closest individual to him triple h

379
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:27,940
he's been involved in he broke him through the cell he wins my hallway

380

404
01:13:45,810 --> 01:13:56,859
every single time nobody looked at it and said hey maybe we shouldn't just have the same

405
01:13:56,939 --> 01:14:04,720
room and same combo you took out that center divider so now you have 25 more cooking area

406
01:14:08,770 --> 01:14:12,210
so you can cook a lot of different things exactly right like how about pizza

407
01:14:16,430 --> 01:14:27,970
it makes the best pizza i've ever had now this is my almost instant pizza dough and the

408
01:14:28,609 --> 01:14:32,579
recipe comes with it all you have to just pop it in there and then put whatever toppings

409
01:14:32,579 --> 01:14:37,380
you like it's a personal pizza so you don't have to wait for the delivery man pay extra

410
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:42,020
for all the toppings no tip for the driver either exactly now this is that reduced fat

411
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:45,859

01:34:47,920 --> 01:35:18,130
why wear it do i have to play as did you really just do like the rock

466
01:35:57,739 --> 01:36:02,289
give him the people's elbow i'll try but i'm he's the rock i'm not the rock

467
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:25,949
all right i got it i got the people's elbow oh dad you suck oh that was a nice slide

468
01:36:26,670 --> 01:36:50,699
does anyone want to watch all the dialogue of the game at like times 20 speed so we can just

469
01:36:50,699 --> 01:37:06,939
figure out what happened just like yeah sure we could figure out what happened i'm not i don't

470
01:37:06,939 --> 01:37:14,689
think it's impossible got it with a drop kick yeah that was pretty good oh we're in the hell

471
01:37:14,689 --> 01:37:32,449
in a cell right here oh right up against the cage new game plus has dialogue but why would

472
01:37:32,449 --> 01:37:40,590
you want to play through this whole thing again like the video game itself is just is just awful

473
01:37:40,590 --> 01:37:46,479
right if the story was good you don't really you don't want to play through this again

474
01:37:49,279 --> 01:37:53,439
if the game was a little bit more fun maybe but okay you could you could have a really

475
01:37:53,439 --> 01:37:56,479
interesting story well though you have to play through the whole game and then play through it

476
01:37:56,479 --> 01:38:02,369
again to be able to hear everything but like the the fighting has just been the same two

477
01:38:02,369 --> 01:38:10,989
combos why are we doing like the dragon ball z we both fought for five minutes now we're

478
01:38:10,989 --> 01:38:20,609
gonna have dialogue sequence they really are doing that it's like a smash brothers trailer

479
01:38:20,609 --> 01:38:50,659
what the hell was that oh the double knockout the double knockout who is this they're not

480
01:38:50,659 --> 01:38:54,659
she's not going to come over and put the mask on right is that like a who is this is that

481
01:38:54,659 --> 01:39:04,449
the girl that was just standing there if she puts the mask on and i have to fight this girl

482
01:39:05,010 --> 01:39:25,789
she's gonna be naked don't be naked don't go all the way here and just and be naked

483
01:39:25,789 --> 01:39:55,779
or something don't do that i'm gonna do my best i'm gonna do my best to lip sync it

484
01:39:56,819 --> 01:39:57,619
to the lip match

485
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:35,340
no you're ruining my immersion i don't want to hear it i've been so used to not hearing it i

486
01:40:35,340 --> 01:41:09,039
don't want to hear it we're here for the ending credits we have to see it sing it

487
01:41:36,430 --> 01:41:39,010
stars

488
01:41:43,170 --> 01:41:48,770
this is one of those movies that you go see with a group of people

489
01:41:50,210 --> 01:41:56,659
and you spend the money on it and then the car rider you walk out you know the movie ends

490
01:41:56,659 --> 01:42:02,739
the credit okay everyone gets up silent on the way out you get in the car doors close close

491
01:42:02,739 --> 01:42:10,060
close that's like four of you nobody talks it's dead silent and finally somebody's just like

492
01:42:10,939 --> 01:42:20,050
so was the was the son the bad guy or was the mom and it was i don't i don't know man that was

493
01:42:20,050 --> 01:42:30,779
whatever like nobody has any fucking idea it's in it's quiet for like 15 to 20 minutes until

494
01:42:30,779 --> 01:42:38,689
somebody decides to bring it up because you all paid for it and you and you spent time there

495
01:42:38,689 --> 01:42:42,449
you know what i mean yeah it was like a two or three hour movie nobody wants to admit that

496
01:42:42,449 --> 01:42:50,420
that was a bad idea oh wow we all just wasted our evening no nobody what no so let me like

497
01:42:50,420 --> 01:43:15,869
let me get this straight dude get rid of the whole beginning part and give me the

498
01:43:15,869 --> 01:43:20,939
give me like the electric bird man stuff with all those cool moves

499
01:43:20,939 --> 01:44:00,930

502
01:44:31,859 --> 01:44:49,600
working out yes you will not a bad song see what's it called in the time that it takes

503
01:44:49,600 --> 01:45:14,560
to show the twins on screen is that what it's called after you always stay for the after

504
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:24,130
infinity war credits push her off and this would be of two letter grades higher oh well here

529
01:51:02,989 --> 01:51:08,430
guy this is what this game makes no sense this guy we heard him in the beginning we heard this

530
01:51:08,430 --> 01:51:16,859
shit before he see he talks why did halfway through the game we just we couldn't hear

531
01:51:16,859 --> 01:51:34,590
anymore see why were we able to hear him do that but then 30 40 minutes later it's just

532
01:51:34,590 --> 01:51:50,659
muffled sounds all right where's the scene that we need context you know what i mean

533
01:51:52,130 --> 01:52:06,460
oh i can't i can't just skip all of them this is no sound though all right let's just

534
01:52:06,460 --> 01:52:25,739
press let's get it over with yeah i couldn't use the top one separate progress yeah okay hold on

535
01:52:26,300 --> 01:52:35,359
too late for a refund yeah that's all right i had a good time listening to music and putting

536
01:52:35,359 --> 01:52:42,380
fucking weird sound effects over my stream we were all just sitting in a room and i was

537
01:52:42,380 --> 01:52:50,640
pressing buttons and loud sounds and music was coming out i may as well just had a black

538
01:52:50,640 --> 01:52:59,920
screen you know it gets to a point when you start to play the ed ed and eddie theme song

539
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:06,640
and then put and then a portion of an entire episode yeah it's you've lost control completely

540
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:13,180
and it's like the stream's off the rails i suppose keep the screen here

541
01:53:21,630 --> 01:53:26,670
and it was that was a weird stream we started on this and then it got voted off the island

542
01:53:27,390 --> 01:53:36,380
i got angry at my computer i i blew up a guy in hitman and then we went back and finished

543
01:53:42,029 --> 01:53:49,149
that was this was very odd but uh i am not streaming tomorrow it's thanksgiving tomorrow

556

583
01:59:21,069 --> 01:59:25,550
he would have to do is plug his ears and blow out as hard as he could and steam would come

out of his nose and melt the bars and he would walk out it's the cartoon comedy land you can

and there was no sound i gotta figure out what the hell is going on with my cpu i might like

603
02:02:19,500 --> 02:02:23,739
flash my bios or something because that made no sense because it wasn't just the fact that

604
02:02:23,739 --> 02:02:28,859
the game was slowing down i was getting encoding errors on obs and i haven't had one of those

605
02:02:28,859 --> 02:02:38,800
in at least two three years in my reading chat yeah i reach out all the time in fact probably

02:16:25,939 --> 02:16:29,619
game looks pretty interesting but it made my brain shit itself. i'll have to ask my

696
02:16:30,340 --> 02:16:35,219
tutor to give me a double lobotomy and suck a fart out of my ass to feel normal again.

697
02:16:40,180 --> 02:16:44,020
thank you extra cheesy for the two dollars. you should have played this song during the fight

02:17:26,239 --> 02:17:30,239

02:17:49,579 --> 02:18:05,760
to business. business. weird. uh thank you jess. thank you jess for the one dollar. the fact that

706
02:18:05,760 --> 02:18:09,360
playing epic music in the back was the only thing that makes this game engaging and entertaining

707
02:18:09,360 --> 02:18:13,440
really proves that it was stupid to take the audio out in the first place especially when it

708
02:18:13,440 --> 02:18:17,469
doesn't have a real purpose for the story. i think it's just they want you to play the

709
02:18:17,469 --> 02:18:26,750
whole game again. but yes i don't i don't understand either. uh valuki thanks for the

710
02:18:26,750 --> 02:18:30,989
one dollar. you should have used acid bass for that final fight but acid bass didn't make it

oh thank you errorless. thank you dr clay for the five dollars. hey man this is a great stream.

734
02:22:19,069 --> 02:22:23,149

735
02:22:23,149 --> 02:22:26,670
of a lot of people. i honestly have no idea what the story was or anything. i feel like

736
02:22:26,670 --> 02:22:30,750
i saw the last episode of some anime without watching any of the previous episodes.

737
02:22:30,750 --> 02:22:35,149
but with all the funny bits you really kept the ball rolling. i'm honestly glad this game exists

738
02:22:35,149 --> 02:22:38,909
because if it didn't then this stream wouldn't have happened. have a wonderful thanksgiving

739
02:22:38,909 --> 02:22:47,920
take care. thank you. thank you so much you as well. i'm glad we could turn it a cinnamon dog

742
02:23:06,350 --> 02:23:09,229

743
02:23:09,229 --> 02:23:12,110
but i've been watching you for at least six years now and you're easily my favorite

744
02:23:12,110 --> 02:23:15,469
content creator on the internet. i love everything you've done and you never cease to

745
02:23:15,469 --> 02:23:19,149
amaze me with the things that you come up with. you've done so much for me mentally i

746
02:23:19,149 --> 02:23:22,909
can't even begin on it. i even think you're too good to be true because of how many

747
02:23:22,909 --> 02:23:29,549
idiots are out there. so hope you don't accidentally say something very bad one day or something.

748
02:23:33,440 --> 02:23:48,100
no. no. i'm a what you see is what you get kind of person and i mean i'm just me.

749
02:23:58,620 --> 02:24:03,020
bass is the worst instrument. but that was just an 85% cinnamon dog piss joke.

750
02:24:03,579 --> 02:24:23,020
i just do this because i don't have any like ulterior motives or anything. i don't want to

751
02:24:24,190 --> 02:24:30,209
you know sell you guys something or try to do something that i'm not capable of or

752
02:24:31,170 --> 02:24:36,129
put on some kind of persona that's not real. i mean i'm like i'm like this in fucking real

753
02:24:36,129 --> 02:24:45,840
life. ask anybody that i know that you know i'm i this is just i don't i it's exhausting

754
02:24:45,840 --> 02:24:53,340
to put on like a personality or pretend to be somebody it is it is absolutely exhausting and

755
02:24:53,340 --> 02:25:00,780
i do not envy people that do that because you end up having to put on a face and pretend so

756
02:25:00,780 --> 02:25:07,809
often and so long that you have to it's it's it's step one to everything you do and say

757
02:25:11,889 --> 02:25:18,219
he randomly uses his tuber voice it's kind of but like also remember i mean i am speaking

758
02:25:18,219 --> 02:25:28,180
into a microphone right so i i wanted to so i guess it's impossible to 100% be the exact same

759
02:25:28,180 --> 02:25:32,180
person that you are in reality because i have a microphone here and i want to make sure you can

760
02:25:32,180 --> 02:25:37,059
hear it and and i'm i have audio set up and is being recorded you know obviously i'm

761
02:25:38,020 --> 02:25:52,100
try to be as real as i can but no i don't i don't think you have to worry about me

762
02:25:53,809 --> 02:26:05,170
trying to like put on a face or act in a different way i just hope that you still

763
02:26:05,170 --> 02:26:11,250

802
02:31:31,870 --> 02:31:36,030
you lost from restarting your computer but if you don't want to if you were in the new super

803
02:31:36,030 --> 02:31:44,700
spash brothers game what would be your special moves um i mean it would just be every single

804
02:31:44,700 --> 02:31:50,540
direction like my let my side be my up be down be would just be the power of the sun

805
02:31:50,540 --> 02:31:57,659
in a 600 foot long beam in every direction you just press side b and it would do like 40

806
02:31:57,659 --> 02:32:04,190
damaged uh per tick you can just fill the whole screen and no one would ever touch me and i'd

807
02:32:04,190 --> 02:32:22,209
win every time that's op yeah it is you think they're gonna patch it nope so guys bayonetta

808
02:32:22,930 --> 02:32:29,760
was was impossible to play and play against bayonetta for the wii u version just beat

809
02:32:29,840 --> 02:32:37,549
everybody and she was like an s plus plus plus plus tier you know the guy you know the guy read

810
02:32:37,549 --> 02:32:50,739
the papers they're like i pay attention to the papers i wonder what they are gonna do though

811
02:32:50,739 --> 02:32:55,299
because nintendo does not really at all like to patch games and fighting games in general

812
02:32:55,299 --> 02:33:05,440
they kind of require balance updates don't they i wonder if they're gonna do that did they

813
02:33:05,440 --> 02:33:15,629
actually patch uh smash wii u and do balance updates and everything they did have a patch

814
02:33:15,629 --> 02:33:28,739
cycle no they patched it twice well ah there's almost 100 characters this time i'm sure there'll

815
02:33:28,739 --> 02:33:33,219
be those i'm sure they'll be like the five to ten characters because when you make that

816
02:33:33,219 --> 02:33:39,090
many characters it's like a moba you know all right welcome to league of legends there are

817
02:33:39,090 --> 02:33:46,209
180 characters in this game but only play four of them five of them that are really worth

818
02:33:46,290 --> 02:33:56,350
your time maybe seven of them out of the almost 200 characters in league how many of them are

819
02:33:56,350 --> 02:34:01,549
actually worth going into lane with is it am i wrong saying that's like probably 20 characters

820
02:34:01,549 --> 02:34:27,600
out of like a hundred and thousand about 50 about 30 how many are in the game 15 unless

821
02:34:27,600 --> 02:34:39,440
you can one trick certain ones they're like 200 characters in league most of them are

822
02:34:39,440 --> 02:34:49,170
actually played now really i remember hearing about people talk about uh it was there was i

823
02:34:49,170 --> 02:34:56,129
mean maybe it's the game has changed or the better i don't know if you're bad at it like

824
02:34:56,129 --> 02:35:04,020
me you can play whatever you want yeah you've even games like overwatch and that game had far

825
02:35:04,020 --> 02:35:09,139
less characters a while ago wasn't there was the same two teams facing each other

826
02:35:18,290 --> 02:35:25,360
overwatch meta l u l i haven't played it in a long time so i'm obviously speaking from

827
02:35:25,360 --> 02:35:53,340
total ignorance but just play tanks i've seen a lot of people upset at that game but it's all

828
02:35:53,340 --> 02:35:59,180
good as long as you're having fun playing a game then i'm glad you're having fun i'm not going

829
02:35:59,180 --> 02:36:02,860

830
02:36:02,860 --> 02:36:07,180

872
02:41:22,799 --> 02:41:30,500
father no it's not illegal it's just it's it makes it room for some other songs you know

02:41:30,500 --> 02:41:38,379
what i mean still a great song hey lawn two thanks for the one dollar here hey germa some

874
02:41:38,379 --> 02:41:41,899
of the thrives in front of a camera do you have any advice for someone who has never been on

875
02:41:41,899 --> 02:41:46,620
camera i'll be attending a big dota 2 tournament and i'm nervous that i'll make a fool of myself

876
02:41:46,620 --> 02:41:54,989
on camera i have loved the stream keep it up um yeah i mean i here's the the best advice

877
02:41:54,989 --> 02:42:02,129
i could give you but be in front of a camera you treat the camera like uh it's somebody you

878
02:42:02,129 --> 02:42:10,940
want to talk to because you do you know the camera is an extension of of people's eyes

879
02:42:12,319 --> 02:42:17,659
and i've always just kind of treated the camera like a friend you know somebody that i want to

880
02:42:17,659 --> 02:42:21,659
talk to because i do want to talk and i do want to talk to it so you can kind of imagine

881
02:42:21,659 --> 02:42:26,579
that the camera is actually a person that you're hanging out with and it's not that far

882
02:42:26,579 --> 02:42:43,840
from the truth give it a try camera's a friend except cameras don't want to talk to you

883
02:42:44,159 --> 02:42:55,069
yeah but the the camera is not a doesn't have a mouth that has eyes but hopefully the good that

884
02:42:55,069 --> 02:43:02,030
helps you out good luck in the good luck in the tournament hopefully you do well don't know

885
02:43:02,030 --> 02:43:08,290
much about dota 2 but hope you uh hope you knock it out of the park uh thank you so much

886
02:43:08,290 --> 02:43:15,950
you know for the one dollar not a virus okay it's a youtube link so it can't be a virus

887
02:43:16,590 --> 02:43:27,739
virus here's the chat bot thing to talk to a woman for a change so you don't talk with women often

888
02:43:28,780 --> 02:43:33,260
that's right but there should be limits i don't know but it's the twitter people

889
02:43:33,260 --> 02:43:41,420
