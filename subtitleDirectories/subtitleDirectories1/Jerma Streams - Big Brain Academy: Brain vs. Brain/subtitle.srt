00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:27,160
Hello. Big Brain Academy is installed. We're not gonna play it yet. Not yet. That was fast. It was.

2
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:33,340
Jump scared you? I'm sorry. I'm just ready to get back into- I'm gonna play one more

3
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:41,619
Picross level and then we're gonna open Big Brain Academy, okay? One final Picross level.

4
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:52,420
Agrabas. Oh shit. I cli- all right, never mind. We're playing Big Brain Academy now, apparently.

5
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:56,659
I- I clicked that button. I did the- I closed it. All right.

6
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:17,609
Big Brain Academy. Brain versus brain. Here we go. Let's go. Big Brain Academy is not brain age.

7
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:25,640
What? What are you talking about? This is not brain age? Wait, how many brain games are there?

8
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:34,650
What do you mean wrong game? I bought the wrong game. Big Brain? Big Brain! What? What are you

9
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:46,379
talking about? There's another one? Brain age is not available on the Switch in North America.

10
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:58,500
This is the one we're playing. Yeah, me. Me. Johnny 500. Okay.

11
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:05,109
Do you feel as if your brain has been a bit more stiff than usual? Well, here at the academy we

12
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:09,370
offer a variety of activities to help you stretch and flex that brain of yours. This game is good,

13
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:16,120
don't worry. Okay. So without further ado, let's get started stretching your brain. To begin,

14
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,520
we'll enroll you in the academy. So if you would, tell us about yourself. How old are you?

15
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:35,159
Did I have to fucking ask that question? No, I'm not that old. I'm- I'm like fucking 32,

16
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:48,699
man. I'm like 34. I'm too old. Yeah, I was- I was going on January 1st, 1988. 1987. 1986. 1985.

17
00:02:48,699 --> 00:03:08,629
Who cares? Tell us your style. Your occupation. Choose something close to your real occupation.

18
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:15,719
Um, okay. Preschooler, grade schooler, middle schooler, high schooler, college student,

19
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:27,099
student of life. I'm a- I'm a business owner. Self-employed, free agent. I'm a business owner.

20
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:38,360
I'm a business owner, free agent, self-employed office worker. Just combine them. Self-employed.

21
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,139
Next up, your catchphrase. You can change this later, so just pick anything that strikes you.

22
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:56,650
Uh, buried in homework. Send help. But you forgot like the crying emoji. Can't say no to candy.

23
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:05,080
I have only one speed and it's easy, does it? That's kind of accurate. Gotta finish strong.

24
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:15,219
I'll do it to- or that. I only have one speed and it's easy, does it? I'll do it tomorrow.

25
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:20,819
How do grown-ups get to have all the fun? It's- it's funny how the ages- the different age groups.

26
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:26,339
This is like for a kid to say this. Is it a lounge day? Why do grown-ups get out of fun?

27
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:34,500
Like a grown-up's not supposed to pick that. Comfort is key. Can't be too careful.

28
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:43,769
It's simple. Be sincere. I like to be liked. Why- we- why make only one mistake? I'm a big-

29
00:04:43,769 --> 00:04:48,009
I'm a fan of being a fan. My grandkids are the cutest. Horses are better than people.

30
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:57,269
I like the appearance you prefer while attending our academy. You can change this later as well,

31
00:04:57,269 --> 00:05:18,949
so don't fret. Okay. Okay. Gotta- hold on. That's pretty close. Close.

32
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:48,889
That's not bad either. Which one? It's this one. It has to be. Okay, facial hair. No, I don't have

33
00:05:48,889 --> 00:06:10,569
facial hair. German, I hate 5 green. All right, I'm done. Also, allow me to introduce our online

34
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:17,660
features. You can compete with others in Ghost Clash. I don't want to do that. Are you comfortable

35
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:27,350
with photographs of bugs? This option prevents photographs of some creepy critters from appearing.

36
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:39,910
But they were- what do you mean bugs? Okay, practice. Let's go. Let's begin by stretching

37
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:47,430
and flexing your brain in practice. Tada! Welcome to practice. It's our specialty here at the academy.

38
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:54,550
If I may, I suggest you start by trying an activity in the identify category. Why not

39
00:06:54,550 --> 00:07:02,310
give whack match a try? You can play with either button or touch. I'm gonna play with buttons.

40
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:19,459
Whack the mole with the matching picture. That's kind of depressing. Okay, just click the things.

41
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:45,750
All right. It's easy. All right. I need a face cam for this, don't I? Yeah. No, no, no. I got it.

42
00:07:47,290 --> 00:08:12,870
I got- I need- I distracted myself. Fuck. All right. All right. All right. All right. Right.

43
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:17,129
I need a face cam. I gotta put clothes on. Hold on. You guys need to be able to see my face for this.

44
00:08:17,129 --> 00:09:59,750
One sec. I just need a shirt. Okay. I'm back. Let me just make sure this looks- all right.

45
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:27,100
Should. How's it look? Do I look all right? Too dark. Why is it so dark? Oh, shit. Hold on.

46
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:37,240
I gotta change the setting here. Hold on. I wasn't planning on this. Put the light on? I do have a

47
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:49,509
light on. Every webcam that's been created is- has some of the worst light controls ever. That's

48
00:10:49,509 --> 00:11:12,970
better. All right. Let's go. You ready? This is gonna stay on for Elden Ring anyways. It's a delay.

49
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:22,220
Oh, shit. That's right. Hold on. I gotta fix that. I didn't even check to make sure that that was

50
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:36,710
actually working, by the way. There we go. All right. We actually have to test this to make sure

51
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:43,269
that everything's synced up correctly. Because when you pull a console through a capture card,

52
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:57,370
it just delays it. That's good, right? One, two, three. I did pretty good. All right. One gold

53
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:18,460
lobe medal. All right. This is actually kind of- this is gonna be fun. No. Try to collect all the

54
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:25,289
gold lobe medals. All right. So that was just one- all right. That was a cool thing. Your journey

55
00:12:25,289 --> 00:12:31,450
towards impressive big brain bronze scores just began. All right. I'll just keep doing it.

56
00:12:33,049 --> 00:12:41,450
Memorize, analyze, compute. Oh, wait. We need to test this. One, two, three, four, five, six,

57
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:58,580
seven, eight, nine, ten. Is it in sync? One, two, three, four, five. No? Videos later? Is it close

58
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:29,419
enough? Game is late. I'm going- all right. Let me try this. One, two, three. One, two, three.

59
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:41,940
Better? All right. Flash memory. Let's try this one. Use the buttons. What were the numbers and

60
00:13:41,940 --> 00:14:37,240
symbols? Five, six, six. They're just showing it to me. Six. Oh, okay. I get it. What the fuck? I

61
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:46,539
didn't- what? What? I didn't want to go forward that other way. Dude, I didn't want to go- the

62
00:14:46,539 --> 00:15:04,500
button- I pressed the button accidentally one more time. All right. That was fun. Focus up. I'm

63
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:10,360
focusing. I just pressed the- I- by the way, would you like to see the perfect controller?

64
00:15:14,299 --> 00:15:27,940
This is perfect in every way. And placement, analog placement, the face buttons. I thought

65
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:32,259
you just got mad at it. Yeah, but I got mad at me because I pressed the button accidentally

66
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:39,769
one more time. I actually think this is- the one thing I would change on this is the triggers

67
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:44,250
I think should have a little bit more give. But placement wise and hand placement, I like it the

68
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:51,940
most. The pro controller. The PS5 controller is the best one, right? I mean, that's simple.

69
00:15:52,500 --> 00:16:51,659
All right. Which one is heavier? I don't know. There's too many things, too many colors.

70
00:16:51,659 --> 00:17:03,750
There's too many colors. Literally. I can't do this. It's too many different things are on the

71
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:29,589
screen. I saw a Mega Mart shirt. Oh, you noticed. That was really cool. I got three medals. Wow.

72
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:34,890
There's more? Choose two cards that add up to the number shown at the top.

73
00:17:35,450 --> 00:18:27,299
So it's just addition. It doesn't matter what animal it is. Oh, that was a nine?

74
00:18:39,099 --> 00:18:56,579
Um, ah! I can't. Too many colors. Oh my god, he's stupid. No, I'm a visual learner.

75
00:18:56,579 --> 00:19:00,500
Okay, you- I'm gonna destroy- here's the thing. People are gonna talk all this shit.

76
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:07,619
I am going to destroy one of these. And you people are gonna think there's something wrong with me.

77
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:11,640
You're gonna think I'm cheating. There's, like, one learning category that I'm gonna do really

78
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,200
good in and I'm gonna get, like, ultra advanced. Ultra advanced. The rest of these are gonna be,

79
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:24,099
like, at a fourth grade level. This is not one of them. This is not one of them. I know this.

80
00:19:24,099 --> 00:20:31,450
I've had- I've taken this test before. Wait, oh. What? Little one. But that was every single piece.

81
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:43,130
Being a visual learner was proven to be bullshit. Only, uh, people made it up.

82
00:20:43,769 --> 00:20:59,529
Only intermediate. I'm not good at this kind of stuff. Just wait till they get to the fucking

83
00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:02,250
numbers and I'm gonna destroy it and I'm gonna make you all look foolish.

84
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:07,559
How would it look if you looked at it from the direction of the arrow?

85
00:21:07,559 --> 00:22:29,500
The fuck are you talking about? That one hurts my head. Slow down? Uh, isn't there a timer?

86
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:39,059
The timer. Isn't it, like, tick. Tick. Tick. I hear, like, a clock ticking.

87
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:47,430
There is a timer. Yeah, there is. Add the missing tracks. All right, let's fucking look-

88
00:22:47,430 --> 00:23:53,819
let's look like an idiot. What do you mean, add the track? Oh. Oh, I didn't want to press that one.

89
00:23:53,819 --> 00:23:58,599
I- seriously, it's really sensitive. Um, sometimes I- it's like, I go- it goes, like,

90
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:04,140
double or it doesn't go at all. Like, I was trying to move and sometimes it would go, like,

91
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:09,619
tick, tick, and tick twice. This D-pad sucks. This controller sucks. It's just got good placement,

92
00:24:09,619 --> 00:24:31,190
that's all. Oh my god, it's perfect. Uh, yeah, I'll put on sunglasses. Cool. All right, nice.

93
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:46,299
So that was memorized. This is analyze. I'm gonna look really bad to a lot of people.

94
00:24:46,299 --> 00:24:59,059
People are gonna think, like, I'm on drugs or something. Speed sorting. Which picture

95
00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:11,910
fits the description? Plant. Living. Plant. Fish. Doesn't swim with fins? Wait, what does that mean?

96
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:16,140
I don't get it. I don't- what does it mean? Doesn't swim with fins. What does that mean?

97
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:34,549
No, I wanted to do the car. What the fuck? The fucking ladybug is not- I could start using the

98
00:25:34,549 --> 00:26:03,259
analog. That's worse somehow. What was that? Was that a mall screw? It was an eggplant.

99
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:21,079
I thought it was a muscle. I want to do that one again. I want to do this one again.

100
00:26:22,779 --> 00:26:44,339
Ah, okay. I thought that was like a celestial body. What was it? Fins. No! I didn't want to press that.

101
00:26:44,900 --> 00:27:08,220
For some reason, I didn't think pig was a mammal. I thought it was a trick question for some reason.

102
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:15,859
I was like, what is it then? What's- um, I don't know. What else is cold-blooded? A bug's cold-blooded?

103
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:42,359
I can't even relax. A bug's cold-blooded? I'm serious. I don't- I don't know. You only hear

104
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:48,279
that for like lizards and shit. I don't fucking know. The bugs don't even have blood. They have

105
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:54,410
like fucking- they have like cerebral fluid and that's it. Bugs don't have blood? They have like

106
00:27:54,410 --> 00:28:18,859
a little bit of like juice in their head. Shark is not a fish, I thought. I thought that was a big

107
00:28:18,859 --> 00:28:45,700
debate. These eat things? No! I thought it said move with legs. What do you mean? A tricycle is-

108
00:28:45,700 --> 00:29:11,049
What do you mean slower than a bug? Fourth slowest? No! The fucking d-pad sucks!

109
00:29:16,579 --> 00:29:20,740
I want to go like this way and I go like up left, up left, up left, up left. It's like up left,

110
00:29:20,740 --> 00:30:21,190
up left, up left. I'm just trying to go right, man. One more try, that's it. Okay, I don't know,

111
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:48,490
the octopus laid eggs. Oh, I got it. All right, that was super elite. All right, cool, cool, cool,

112
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:57,910
cool, cool. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. All right, match blast.

113
00:30:57,910 --> 00:32:11,539
This is fun, damn. Break blocks to copy the top shape. I get it. All right, that was too hard.

114
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:20,970
That was too hard. That was too- that was way too much. Oh yeah, I fucking guarantee if he tried

115
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:24,730
to hit me with a sword I could dodge- I could dodge it. I fucking guarantee it. If you had a

116
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:28,170
fucking battle axe and you were gonna try to get me with it, you're not gonna get me with it.

117
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:33,130
You won't- I'm too fast for you. Way too fast. I would- I would- I would- no way.

118
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:39,049
Okay, I am fast as fuck and I have- I have lightning-like reflexes in real life.

119
00:32:39,609 --> 00:32:44,170
I don't care what some little fucking grasshopper says about how stupid I am.

120
00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:50,039
You got- you got swing of the axe? I'm fucking gone. Not happening.

121
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:12,470
Why- I've been playing too many video games. Like, why is that the first thing I go to? I've been

122
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:18,460
playing too much Elden Ring, I really have. I've been playing too many video games. All right,

123
00:33:18,460 --> 00:34:16,780
how many cubes are there? Three. What the 16 of those? I can't concentrate.

124
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:27,269
18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. I can't concentrate. I can't concentrate. I don't like this one.

125
00:34:27,269 --> 00:34:34,599
I actually can't concentrate. I'm fine. I'm okay. I just can't concentrate. I'm-

126
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:37,800
I have huge concentration problems ever since I was a little child.

127
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:43,130
I'm telling you, you got me with an axe! And I'm fucking gonna dodge it.

128
00:34:43,690 --> 00:35:03,289
Compute. There's more on to memorize. Memo random. Memorize the picture on the car before it flips.

129
00:35:03,289 --> 00:35:14,840
Which one was it? I should be- I'm gonna do- I'm gonna get super little on this one. Wait, oh,

130
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:33,699
it's the one it flips over. Okay, I didn't understand the rules. Oh, fucking come on. I didn't-

131
00:35:34,420 --> 00:36:12,150
I didn't even fucking look at what it was. Slow down. All right, and I understand- I didn't

132
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:31,139
understand the rules at the first few rounds for this. All right, reverse retention. Remember

133
00:36:31,139 --> 00:37:51,420
the order and answer in reverse. Shit! Did you see the face you're making? I don't care.

134
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:57,690
This game is fun and everything, but what would happen if somebody came at this guy with an axe?

135
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:04,489
I'll tell you what would happen. They wouldn't hit me. I would be on the other side of the room.

136
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:09,849
It would be like Dark Souls in real life. They'd be like, oh, I'm coming this way. And I'd fucking

137
00:38:10,809 --> 00:38:20,940
dodge it with perfect frame rate. Perfect frame invulnerability. Covered cages. Where are the

138
00:38:20,940 --> 00:39:33,500
birds? Make the cages go faster if you're up for it. I get it, okay. Already gone. I didn't get to

139
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:53,480
super elite? Ooh, he was happy about that one. Legit based elite brain. Thank you. All right,

140
00:39:53,480 --> 00:40:01,800
okay. All right, so what do I do now? Oh, okay. Practice. Test. Wait, I haven't seen all these.

141
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:09,800
All right, here we go. Species. Which animal is there more of? Look around with the spotlight.

142
00:40:10,440 --> 00:41:31,530
I don't need them. They're the same. Not even super elite. I wonder if this guy could definitely

143
00:41:31,530 --> 00:42:08,329
dodge battle axe. I could. Which piece belongs in the box? Pay attention. Oh, I didn't want to pick

144
00:42:08,329 --> 00:42:47,210
that one. I'm getting frustrated. It gives me a fucking headache. I like know it too. I can see

145
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:55,510
it, but my brain just can't do it. I can see it. It's just like, it's like mushing it all together.

146
00:42:56,070 --> 00:43:02,150
I can't. I just can't do it, man. It's just like, it just mushes in my brain.

147
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:09,480
It's like I start looking at all of them at the same time. My brain sees all of them and yo,

148
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:22,469
I'm dodging that. He's peeking. I'm fine. Fast focus. What is the picture of? How fast can you

149
00:43:22,469 --> 00:44:13,269
figure it out? It's a rabbit. It's a hippo. Owl. Snail. What? What is it? Is it a dog? It's a dog.

150
00:44:16,389 --> 00:44:31,340
House. I don't know. A butterfly? What the fuck is that? What is that? Snake. I'll try it again.

151
00:44:31,340 --> 00:45:08,500
I like that one. That one's fun. Again, I like that one. It's the concrete that fucked me up.

152
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:40,840
No, I didn't want to press it. I wanted to press panda. I guess it's a cat. It could have been a

153
00:45:40,840 --> 00:46:08,219
snail. How the fuck are you supposed to do that? One more. This whole game could be contained in

154
00:46:08,219 --> 00:46:13,929
a 10 megabyte flash website from 2008. I mean, that's kind of funny what you just said, but

155
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:57,500
oh, it's probably seal or fish. Probably seal. Seal. Cow. Giraffe. Ostrich? I don't know what this is.

156
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:27,139
I don't think you can blur it any harder. What is that? Fucking panda. I wasn't pretending. I was

157
00:47:27,139 --> 00:47:31,059
looking at the middle because the panda was facing the other way. It was like the back. It was like

158
00:47:31,059 --> 00:47:44,809
the back of a panda. I haven't seen a panda very much in my life either. No. All right. That was

159
00:47:44,809 --> 00:47:50,809
cool. So now we do. There's a couple we didn't do in visualize. I'm going to do this one. Shadow

160
00:47:50,809 --> 00:48:37,800
shift. Find the pictures that match the shadows. No, I didn't want to click it. The round head.

161
00:48:37,800 --> 00:49:08,840
Well, it's in there. You got something on the top right of your screen. What is it? Tell me what it

162
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:21,239
is so I can be aware of what it is. Okay. I have, I have to read it analog clock. Mallet math. What

163
00:49:21,239 --> 00:49:25,400
is that? Oh, mallet math. Whack the blocks. You don't need to leave behind the correct total.

164
00:49:26,199 --> 00:49:58,010
I need four. I'm going to be ugly. Three, six, nine, 12, five, 10, 14, 21.

165
00:49:58,010 --> 00:50:16,679
Oh, seven, 14, 21, six, six, seven, eight, five, six, seven, five, eight, nine, 10, nine, 10.

166
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:23,099
No, I didn't want to do that. Why did it fucking move? I wanted to get rid of the other one.

167
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:36,969
21, 21, 21. No, I didn't. I seriously, sometimes it just like goes. I don't not try to press the

168
00:50:36,969 --> 00:51:02,070
button. You dodged into it. Rotate the clock hands to match the time. Bring forward an hour.

169
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:29,829
Fall back 15 minutes. Uh oh. Fall back 30 minutes. Fall back 240 minutes.

170
00:51:29,829 --> 00:51:54,840
Go forward 120 minutes. Where did I start? Bring forward 245 minutes. Five, 10, 15, 20.

171
00:51:54,840 --> 00:52:00,389
It's weird on the controller. Look, let me show you what happens. Let me show you what happens

172
00:52:00,389 --> 00:52:05,190
when I use the, it's weird on the controller. You're supposed to fucking touch that. Like,

173
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:12,730
it's weird. Like, I can't. It's really weird on the controller. I swear to God.

174
00:52:14,059 --> 00:53:17,130
Hop from lowest to highest. Fuck you. Fuck! Negative 80. What? Dude, I fucking hate this

175
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:23,739
controls. I'm trying to fucking. I can't start over. Start over. Start over. Start over. Start

176
00:53:23,739 --> 00:53:30,570
over. This, this D-pad sucks asshole. It's fucking the worst D-pad I've had in any controller.

177
00:53:40,980 --> 00:54:55,460
Use the analog stick. Analog stick is awful here. Negative 71. Fuck you. I give up. I don't care.

178
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:59,460
I, who gives a shit? Who fucking, what does this even matter? Brain. Oh, brain training.

179
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:04,340
Who gives a shit? What does this matter? Why does this even matter? Like, this whole thing is,

180
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:10,179
doesn't make, who cares? What specific case does it matter if I can pop balloons in a certain order

181
00:55:10,179 --> 00:55:15,139
if they, like, are tricked to make you look bigger and smaller? You know what is practical?

182
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:20,730
I'll tell you what's practical. A guy running at you with an axe and you got nowhere to go.

183
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:26,699
That's what I call practical fucking things to know. I'm telling you, dodging, dashing,

184
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:32,619
and shit. Like that, oh no. Here comes the fucking battle axe. Open up. One, two, three, four,

185
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:38,460
no, you're gone. Sorry buddy. I know practical shit. I don't care about impractical shit like

186
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:50,949
counting balloons in a room of various shapes and colors. Let's take the test. Let's measure

187
00:55:50,949 --> 00:55:58,809
your big brain brawn by having you compete activities in five categories. I'm going double

188
00:55:58,809 --> 00:57:17,610
headphones. Memorize the numbers and symbols. Repeat them before you forget. All right, identify.

189
00:57:18,489 --> 00:57:44,019
No. Which piece belongs in the box? Pay attention to the movement. I'm going to,

190
00:57:44,019 --> 00:59:51,800
shut up. I'm losing points. Number of cubes. The number of cubes. I think I did pretty good.

191
00:59:51,800 --> 01:00:41,190
All right, let's go with the train one. I was good at this one too. Oops. Oops. I'm fucking,

192
01:00:41,750 --> 01:01:09,610
I'm flopping here. I had it. I got to move with it. That's how I do everything. All right,

193
01:01:09,610 --> 01:01:41,380
computing time. All right, that's going to be bad. Put it, sorry. No, I didn't want to go up again.

194
01:01:41,380 --> 01:02:28,010
Fucking controller. What are you doing? Well done. How'd I do? How was your first test?

195
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:36,599
Your test results are reflected in your big brain score. All right, my big brain score is 3,300.

196
01:02:36,599 --> 01:02:45,400
An average person who hasn't spent time in practice will score about 1,500. So I practiced. So I

197
01:02:45,400 --> 01:03:04,389
should be somewhere around two or three thousand. 2886. This is a very good score. I'm going to

198
01:03:04,389 --> 01:03:15,590
give your brain a grade. A plus plus dude. You're getting started. Let's aim for even higher.

199
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:32,579
I can't get higher than A plus plus. I told you I was a visual learner. I'm very, my analytics are

200
01:03:32,579 --> 01:03:43,639
terrible, but I can visualize, compute and identify and attack. I'm going to lay into this.

201
01:03:46,809 --> 01:03:54,280
I don't need to memorize anything. I don't need to analyze anything. Visualize. It is important

202
01:03:54,280 --> 01:04:00,360
to accurately perceive that what you see with your eyes. Furthermore, there's room for improvement

203
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:07,590
in analyze. I recommend flexing and stretching there. What is analyze? If you can answer a little

204
01:04:07,590 --> 01:04:13,610
faster, you'll be better. Tell me, have you been collecting gold low metals? I have no doubt you're

205
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:20,920
capable of buying more. Well then, it's time to announce your big brain type. This is your brain

206
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:33,110
type. Visualizing and computing. See it, compute it, and I can attack it. Visualization and

207
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:58,420
computation. Battleaxe brain Andy. That's fun. So I can do more? What is this? I wonder what that

208
01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:09,159
button does. Try to earn gold medals in every practice activity. Do a ghost clash. I don't think

209
01:05:09,159 --> 01:05:16,920
I pay for the switch online. I don't think I have it. I'm pretty sure I don't have like, I think I

210
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:30,949
stopped it. So wait, this is apparently what I'm bad at. That makes sense. Is it though? I crushed

211
01:05:30,949 --> 01:05:43,559
this. You had it from Mario Tennis. Didn't I crush this in the actual exam? This was bad. So was this.

212
01:05:44,119 --> 01:05:51,639
I nailed it. I got to like, super elite. When are you going to play Elden Ring? Well, I'll tell you.

213
01:05:52,519 --> 01:05:58,090
In literally like, five minutes, ten minutes, I'm going to take a break. It's going to be a long

214
01:05:58,090 --> 01:06:03,690
break. It's going to be somewhere over 15 to 20 minutes. I'm going to eat. I'm going to chill.

215
01:06:05,690 --> 01:06:11,159
And come back in about 15 plus 20, just probably about 20 minutes. And we're going to come back

216
01:06:11,159 --> 01:06:14,920
and play Elden Ring for the rest of the night. So there's going to be an intermission for food.

217
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:22,469
Because I started at like one and I want to be able to go till like, you know, 11, 12, 1 a.m.

218
01:06:22,469 --> 01:06:26,150
I have like a 10 to 12 hour stream, but I want to eat in the middle and go, you know, if I need to

219
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:33,989
do things I can. So I'll be playing it in like 25 minutes, 30 minutes. It's going to be a long one.

220
01:06:33,989 --> 01:06:43,050
Well, the reason, the reason why I did a long stream today specifically, specifically so

221
01:06:44,409 --> 01:06:47,210
is because I'm not going to be around for the next like week.

222
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:53,139
Uh, and I really want to play Elden Ring. So the idea was to break it up a little bit and

223
01:06:53,139 --> 01:06:56,659
play something else that's not Elden Ring, but I still wanted to play Elden Ring because I'm

224
01:06:56,659 --> 01:07:01,059
obsessed with it. And I don't want to not play Elden Ring for like the next five straight days.

225
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:07,260
You know what I mean? Like I was like, I could have just played this and then like done the

226
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:12,539
streamer award stuff because that's this weekend. So that's why I'm not going to be around. So I

227
01:07:12,539 --> 01:07:19,880
will be, and when we come back, a good question of what I'm going to do after that. I'll be on

228
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:26,519
the streamer awards on Saturday. So I'll be hosting it. You'll probably be able to

229
01:07:26,519 --> 01:07:33,800
pick me out in the crowd. I'm sure you'll see me there at some point walking around.

230
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:44,300
I'm also presenting. So I think I'm not hosting it. No, no, but I am. I'm going to be one of the

231
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:51,820
presenters. What about baseball stream? Yeah. I got to get, I got to get a good suit and everything.

232
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:55,260
Yeah. It's going to take, I need to spend the next day or two getting really ready for this.

233
01:07:56,219 --> 01:08:02,250
All right. Let me try this again. But yeah, in about 15, 20 minutes, I'm going to take a break.

234
01:08:02,969 --> 01:08:38,539
It'll be a long one and we'll come back with Elden Ring. No, 16. Why is the controller so bad?

235
01:08:38,539 --> 01:09:07,020
I just, I, who cares about how many blocks you can count? Who cares? I'm going to do that test.

236
01:09:07,020 --> 01:10:21,210
I want, I want to do a different one. I don't want to do the block one again. You idiot.

237
01:10:21,210 --> 01:11:36,380
Got it. Oh, it's too much things. I don't care. No, I want to do the monkey. Yeah.

238
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:44,569
Oh, my analytical brain. Oh no. Okay. I can't analyze things. You can't get all,

239
01:11:44,569 --> 01:12:58,970
you can't have all the infinity stones. Sorry. No, this game. I just, okay. I can't play this

240
01:12:58,970 --> 01:13:09,060
anymore. Can you guys hear? It's coming out of my speakers. It's literally coming out of like my

241
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:19,140
monitor. I, I think I fucked up the whole sound thing. My sound is fucked up permanently. I have

242
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:28,899
to play like this until I do, I take the break. I'm going to turn this off because like you can

243
01:13:28,899 --> 01:14:40,489
hear it here. Do you hear? So whatever. I don't care. I fucked everything up. Almost had it.

244
01:14:40,489 --> 01:14:45,670
Almost had it. It's too awkward. It's coming through my speakers and I can't fix it.

245
01:14:45,670 --> 01:14:53,640
I'll turn it up. Can you hear it now? You guys should be able to hear it now.

246
01:14:55,720 --> 01:15:11,369
At the train to the exit. I think my noise gate is making it so you can't hear it.

247
01:15:11,369 --> 01:16:10,600
No, wrong controls. Whoa. I thought I was starting on the other side. All right. Let's see if I,

248
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:15,739
my brain age went down because obviously, obviously I got fucked up and I was

249
01:16:15,739 --> 01:16:24,220
under extenuating circumstances with this unplugged. I got a higher score than last time.

250
01:16:26,649 --> 01:16:39,979
How? A S minus. I got to S. I don't care. I win. Let's take a closer look at the test results.

251
01:16:39,979 --> 01:16:49,369
I can't stand this, but it has to stay that way. Oh my God. It's a whole chunk of my brain missing.

252
01:16:53,189 --> 01:17:02,970
What the fuck? I'm not going to improve in analytics. It's not going to happen.

253
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:17,510
That sounds so weird coming through here. All right. We're about to take our break

254
01:17:18,069 --> 01:17:38,390
in just a moment. In just a moment. That's fun. I can't get the weight thing down. L ratio brain.

255
01:17:39,029 --> 01:17:46,359
Whatever. I have such trouble with this. I always have. You want to talk about,

256
01:17:46,359 --> 01:17:51,239
okay, wow, dude, your spatial awareness. This is exactly what you should be talking about.

257
01:17:51,239 --> 01:18:17,430
I have trouble with like, like orientation of stuff. Okay. I'm being analytical about this.

258
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:35,350
I'm not, I'm just trying to, I'm not going fast. Okay. Okay. That's better than last time.

259
01:18:35,350 --> 01:18:45,029
I don't know, dude. I don't fucking know. I don't know. It sounds like you're making

260
01:18:45,029 --> 01:18:51,319
pop. When is this bit going to end? I'm, I can't plug this back in. This, this took like five

261
01:18:51,319 --> 01:18:56,649
minutes to get in the right spot behind the monitor so I could hear it. It's not going back

262
01:18:56,649 --> 01:19:11,609
in. I can't do it. Sounds like somebody's breaking tiles in another room. I'm not going to be able

263
01:19:11,609 --> 01:19:22,250
to get gold on any of these. Hold on. Let me try to plug it back in. It's such a weird spot.

264
01:19:22,890 --> 01:19:30,439
I don't think I, do you want to help me plug it in? All right. Here. Go back and play. I just can't

265
01:19:30,439 --> 01:19:48,840
see. Oh yeah. She got it first try. This is so loud. I got to turn this down. She's like sneaking

266
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:59,930
back here. I'll see it a bit. She's like sneaking around. I'll be really honest. I got to be really

267
01:19:59,930 --> 01:20:08,149
honest. Holy shit. I don't even know how she just did that. I don't think you guys understand.

268
01:20:08,149 --> 01:20:15,770
There's like, there's like six inches of space behind the desk and she just was like, boom,

269
01:20:15,770 --> 01:20:22,279
bam, in, gone. That was unfucking believable. It took me like, it took me 15 minutes to get

270
01:20:22,279 --> 01:20:35,640
this plugged in. She's just fucking there. Isn't she great? That was cute. I love that. All right.

271
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:47,689
Just without even being seen either, she's just like gone. Sneak queen. All right. Two, four,

272
01:20:47,770 --> 01:21:08,260
six, seven. I'm about to throw it into the ground. Oh, she knows how to analyze shit.

273
01:21:12,119 --> 01:21:17,319
I just can't, I'm sitting there like, I'm sitting there with a plug just going like,

274
01:21:17,319 --> 01:21:25,300
I don't understand how this goes in there. I just, I can't analyze how it plugs in. I see it's small

275
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:33,899
enough to fit in that hole, but where's that hole? It comes in here with an axe. I'm dodging it.

276
01:21:33,899 --> 01:22:47,909
All right. Start over again. Game's muted. It has to be worth a gold medal. That's a gold medal.

277
01:22:47,909 --> 01:23:15,029
It has to be, right? Yes. Much better. Yeah. Okay. How about identify? I'll get, okay.

278
01:23:15,829 --> 01:24:28,300
All gold medals give you something, right? Fuck you. That's gotta be gold, right? That has to be a

279
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:43,960
gold medal. That's better than what I had before. Come on. Gold. Are you doing the stream? Yeah,

280
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:53,369
I'll be at the stream rewards. Seven, planning on it. Compute. This one's just add up the numbers

281
01:24:53,369 --> 01:26:08,069
and that's it. Don't do anything else. I fucking can't do this one. I can't. No, I need gold. Do

282
01:26:08,069 --> 01:27:34,170
it again. Come on. I need 300. Bingo. That's going to be huge. That's the, that's a triple gold

283
01:27:34,170 --> 01:27:46,869
medal. All right. Come on. This one's weird with the analog. This would be way easier with a finger

284
01:27:46,869 --> 01:28:12,390
or a stylus. It's time to 12. It's weird. 180 minutes, six, 12. So it's backwards. 80 minutes,

285
01:28:12,390 --> 01:28:30,329
six. Okay. Backwards, forward, six, 12, 18. So that's three hours ahead. One, two, three, five,

286
01:28:30,409 --> 01:28:47,560
six, 12. So one, two, 35 minutes, five, 10, 15, 20, 20, 30. All back. Six, 12, one, two, right there.

287
01:28:47,560 --> 01:29:02,659
Do it. I don't think that's gold. I don't think it's gold. I need to be, I need to do a little

288
01:29:02,659 --> 01:29:44,470
bit better than that. Come on, man. No, controller. I fucking hate this thing. It's such a shit.

289
01:29:44,470 --> 01:30:36,619
There's a weird reverb on the mic. It's probably the fan. The fan's blowing into the mic. Is that

290
01:30:36,619 --> 01:30:48,600
the fan on? All right. That's all golds. I could definitely get gold on this one. I only did it

291
01:30:48,600 --> 01:32:23,180
once. Yeah. All right. Only two more and I'm good. Okay. I got to focus on this one. Don't be an

292
01:32:23,180 --> 01:33:56,619
idiot. Fuck you. Do it again. I'm never going to get it. No. Huh? Dude, I don't think I'll ever get

293
01:33:56,619 --> 01:34:49,539
that one past silver. I need 400. I got to do, I almost had it. I just got to get it quick. Shit.

294
01:34:49,539 --> 01:35:13,939
No, you kidding me? You got to be fucking kidding me. The fuck, dude? How are you supposed to do

295
01:35:13,939 --> 01:35:22,010
that? How is it, how is that possible for you to get that in? I don't get it. 100? Oh, wait,

296
01:35:22,010 --> 01:35:32,600
then the four. This shit is just, I can't do it. My brain just can't process it. I don't think I'm

297
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:54,819
ever going to get 400. Dude, it's like the, it's the segmentation that my brain just goes,

298
01:35:55,539 --> 01:36:01,909
you can't fucking do it. It's the segmented pieces down here that it's like, look, it's done up there,

299
01:36:01,909 --> 01:36:52,069
mom. It's like, no, I can't, my brain just can't do it. Oh, bro. I don't, I can't, I can't, dude.

300
01:36:52,229 --> 01:37:03,859
I can't. This is the one thing that I will never be able to do, ever. The segmented pieces become

301
01:37:03,859 --> 01:37:13,210
one piece in my brain and it's physically not possible for me to do it. Come on, dude. Try

302
01:37:13,210 --> 01:37:29,430
playing it drunk. That would actually probably help. They're all one piece. They're all one piece.

303
01:37:29,430 --> 01:37:36,539
My brain is mushing them all together. It's like, I think they're all connected because they're all

304
01:37:36,539 --> 01:37:41,800
connected. Okay. You know what I wish they would do? I don't want to see the top one. The top one

305
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:46,729
is fucking with my head. It's, it's making them connected down here too. Like I'm just going to

306
01:37:46,729 --> 01:38:56,310
not, I'm going to literally block the top of the screen up. Fuck. It's happening again. Fuck. Did

307
01:38:56,310 --> 01:39:37,880
I get 400? Let go, let go of me, let go, let go of me, let go of me, let go of me. Okay. Fuck.

308
01:40:22,439 --> 01:40:34,390
I got how far did I get? Oh my God. I thought I was up really low on that scale. Minus 300. I got it.

309
01:40:34,949 --> 01:40:49,909
Okay. I got gold on everything. Super practice. In this harder practice, every activity starts

310
01:40:49,909 --> 01:42:36,899
in the advanced class. This is not happening. No, fuck. Jesus. Bet you can't do that. I'm fucking

311
01:42:36,899 --> 01:42:51,960
at it. I will see you guys in exactly, exactly, um, like 20 minutes. We're going to take a long

312
01:42:51,960 --> 01:43:00,359
break. I'm going to come back with Elden Ring. That was fun. This is the end of the first segment

313
01:43:00,359 --> 01:43:07,079
of this stream. I'm going to eat. I'm going to pee again. I'm going to refill my drink, get a water,

314
01:43:07,079 --> 01:43:13,850
and I'll be back for Elden Ring. I'm going to play Elden Ring until I'm done.

315
01:43:15,770 --> 01:43:20,010
So see you in about 20 minutes. I'm going to put text on the screen too, just because

316
01:43:20,890 --> 01:43:33,699
I want to make sure people know that I'm not coming right back. So let's solve that now.

317
01:43:33,699 --> 01:43:41,399
That's where it needs to be. Okay. I'm going to add some text on the screen. This is the intermission.

318
01:43:41,960 --> 01:44:08,949
There you go. I'll see you guys in about 15, 20 minutes. It might even be shorter than that.

319
01:44:08,949 --> 01:44:19,340
Include where you left. Oh, that's a good part. That's a good idea. I don't know. Yeah. I'll write

320
01:44:19,340 --> 01:44:33,930
this 15, 20 minute break. I'll say back at six 40 specific. There you go. That makes more sense.

321
01:44:33,930 --> 01:44:48,460
Let's see how this plays out. So I'll be right back. I'm not going to have any music because

322
01:44:48,460 --> 01:44:53,960
I don't think it'll, it'll just be looping for like 20 minutes. Let's make this really easy to see.

323
01:44:54,600 --> 01:45:05,050
All right. I'll be right back. I'll see you guys at six 40 ish. See how this plays out.

324
01:45:05,050 --> 01:45:12,680
I'm really curious how this works. No, no music. Do random music. Um, I feel like it's going to loop

325
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:19,510
the same thing. Yeah, this is, this is, this is all right. All right. I'll be right back. 20 minutes tops, probably less.
