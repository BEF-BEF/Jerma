00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,820
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here, and Ster, and I don't see Steph. What the hell was that?

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,820
Hi.

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,820
That was like a Chewbacca growl.

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,019
I wanted to announce my presence.

5
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:25,320
That's a great way to do it. I approve of that.

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:32,939
But we're playing the Wave 666 for the Man vs. Machine thing. Probably going to get stomped right now.

7
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:35,939
But you know what? It's only good fun. We'll see how far we can get, baby.

8
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:38,890
So let's ready up. Who are we waiting on?

9
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:39,890
I'm not ready.

10
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,750
Where are you?

11
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:48,869
I'm Chewbacca-ing in spawn. I've never played Engineer before. I need to figure out what the Engi do.

12
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:51,560
What does the Engineer even do? How do you play?

13
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,990
I don't know. I think he builds Sentries and they just shoot at everything.

14
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,990
I've never played this class.

15
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:04,109
Well we have 20 seconds before. Oh goodness. We lost a player.

16
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:08,290
Oh yay! That sucks.

17
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:12,959
Well here we go. Here we go. We lost a guy.

18
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:14,959
I'm coming. I'm coming.

19
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,959
Oh stop. You gotta get over it.

20
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,959
I haven't even made it. Oh this is...

21
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:21,329
Hold on. I'm wiggling.

22
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:24,329
The first few are pretty easy. You can kill them while I pretend I'm sitting.

23
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:26,329
Is this only one wave or are there 600 waves?

24
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:29,329
No, there's one wave. 600 waves?

25
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:38,260
Oh my goodness. Why are they holding down the flamethrower? Is there a reason for that?

26
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,019
Hey Star!

27
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:43,640
Say that you die.

28
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,219
I'm lagging so bad but there's so many crits everywhere.

29
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:49,219
Oh wow.

30
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:51,219
Oh are they coming up the stairs?

31
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:53,659
Look how tall these guys are.

32
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:56,659
Get out of my face. Beggars bazooka baby.

33
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:59,730
So how bad did we lose? Oh!

34
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,969
I have a Sentry.

35
00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:07,730
Give me the money. How come I can't see you guys on my screen?

36
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:14,979
My HUD exploded.

37
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:16,979
This is super lag.

38
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:18,979
We're winning.

39
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:21,979
This round is almost over. Look at the top.

40
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:24,349
Yeah, the round is almost over.

41
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:27,099
And there's 600 more.

42
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:30,099
You better collect all the gold. The monies.

43
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:32,099
I can't even see these bears.

44
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:38,550
What do you do when you run out of ammo?

45
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,550
Am I a dispenser?

46
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,550
Oh no, I gotta get... Oh no.

47
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:46,550
Go, go, go, go. I'm not gonna let go of this until I get some ammo.

48
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,569
There it is.

49
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:52,569
All these demo men are dead right now.

50
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:54,569
I don't know what a Wrangler is or what it do.

51
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:57,569
What it do, what it do.

52
00:02:57,569 --> 00:02:59,740
Look how good we're winning.

53
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,979
We're actually not doing that bad.

54
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:04,979
But of course, this is the first 30 seconds.

55
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:06,979
Well, I didn't think we'd get past 30 seconds.

56
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:08,979
Oh no, they have the bomb.

57
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:10,979
I got enough money to buy some.

58
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,530
Should I not be doing that?

59
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,530
If you buy anything, it should be crit boosts.

60
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,409
Oh, a Sentry Buster. Cool.

61
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:25,409
Right here, here we go.

62
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:27,409
I've never seen a Sentry Buster before.

63
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:29,409
But what it do, what it do.

64
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,900
Look at these guys.

65
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,900
Oh no, Sentry Buster did it.

66
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,900
Oh, that Sentry Buster has health, doesn't it?

67
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,900
Holy cow. Quite a bit of that health too.

68
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,900
I'm sorry about you, Buster.

69
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,900
Oh, my Sentry's fine.

70
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,900
So many crits.

71
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,900
That hurt so much.

72
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:54,080
I mean, man, the problem with this thing is you need so much ammo.

73
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,080
I'm not even 10%, not even 5% done with this wave.

74
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,080
Oh dear.

75
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,020
Holy crap.

76
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,020
All right, we're good.

77
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:07,699
Wait till they drop, wait till they drop.

78
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:11,449
And look at this, look at this flare gun.

79
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:13,449
Crits, crits, oh my god.

80
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:15,689
You should reflect those.

81
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:19,689
With your gun, your primary action slot item.

82
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:21,689
This is ridiculous.

83
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:24,439
Right click on it.

84
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:27,060
This is ridiculous.

85
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,060
I just respawned and came down the aisle and saw all this.

86
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,060
Oh my god, I'm dead.

87
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,060
We're so dead.

88
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,120
Watch out for those things trying to backstab you.

89
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,120
I'm scared now.

90
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,120
Just god, I need to get back.

91
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,120
Oh no.

92
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,420
Delete this.

93
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,750
I don't even know, let's go.

94
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,750
Come on, crit boost, crit boost.

95
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,459
Wow, they have so much health.

96
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:00,459
They're never ever ever ever dying.

97
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:02,459
Oh no.

98
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:05,980
If you shoot with your gun, maybe they'll die.

99
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,180
Oh no, no, no.

100
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,620
I'm dead.

101
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,620
Spam, spam the crits.

102
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,620
I hope you guys enjoyed the video.

103
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,620
No, we haven't lost yet.

104
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,860
You gotta have a good mindset.

105
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,019
There are so many dudes up there.

106
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:27,019
This is ridiculous.

107
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:29,019
I'm not even allowed to walk out of spawn.

108
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:31,019
I don't think they're dudes.

109
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:39,569
This is impossible.

110
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:42,600
They have so much health.

111
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,600
That's basically infinite.

112
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,029
We're alright.

113
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:49,490
We're okay.

114
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,490
The bomb will reset.

115
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,490
You can see it's in the intelligence in this one.

116
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,490
It's on the ground for a while, it goes back.

117
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,709
Damn.

118
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:01,889
Why can I not...there we go.

119
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:02,889
Moving my sentry up.

120
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:05,959
Did we win yet?

121
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:08,959
Judging by the wave indicator.

122
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:12,649
Now, we're getting doodled.

123
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:20,519
We would kindly protect my sentry for like two seconds.

124
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,519
Oh, I have one dude, Renbender.

125
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:24,519
He's just hanging out in spawn, just looking around.

126
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,519
Oh, cool.

127
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,269
I don't even know what's happening.

128
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:32,839
Now he's not.

129
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:33,839
Yes, he is.

130
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:36,740
Oh, they're so tall.

131
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,899
That's how they get their power.

132
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:41,899
Oh, that heavy.

133
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:43,899
Oh my gosh, he killed me instantly.

134
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:45,899
So much damage.

135
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:47,899
Sorry.

136
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:50,079
I'm so scared.

137
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:53,600
I love how they're all zombies, it's so funny.

138
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,100
Oh, are they?

139
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,170
Yeah, they are.

140
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,170
I'm too stupid and I didn't pay attention.

141
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:04,370
If you look at them with your eyes, they actually are zombies.

142
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:09,370
Oh, you see, that's what I forgot to do.

143
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:15,949
Dude, it's all about buying those crit canteens and just spamming around the corner.

144
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:19,540
I don't even care if I die.

145
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,839
What?

146
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,839
That is a really bad mentality.

147
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:24,839
You gotta care a little bit if you die.

148
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:28,100
Dude, you just gotta go hard.

149
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,009
Live fast.

150
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:36,680
So the intelligence reset, right?

151
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,680
Yeah, it's right there.

152
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,110
Yeah, but he's fat.

153
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,110
You can kill him.

154
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,990
Let's just push him over.

155
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,990
We need an equally fat guy to just push him.

156
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,990
Sentry buster, buster coming in.

157
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,230
Oh, star.

158
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:52,230
Oh, they sent my sentry right as the buster came up.

159
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:55,480
I'm so sorry.

160
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,480
But it's okay, I got an achievement.

161
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,480
Hey, achievements are good.

162
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,720
They like help you beat the wave better.

163
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,370
Oh wait, no they don't.

164
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,060
Wow, this is long.

165
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,019
Yeah, yeah.

166
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:12,019
That's what she said.

167
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:13,019
Yeah.

168
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:16,459
That is indeed what she said.

169
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:18,939
Live proof.

170
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:22,939
Oh, whoops, I accidentally bought ammo refill canteens.

171
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:24,939
This isn't helping me.

172
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:26,939
You're an engineer.

173
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:33,370
Probably the person that's the least useful in the entire game.

174
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,370
I love how this guy's just like taunting in the corner.

175
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:42,980
I'm gonna go back to the base and be useful.

176
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,980
Get useful things.

177
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,169
Back to the base.

178
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:51,370
Oh, look at that kill feed.

179
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,370
Here we go.

180
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,370
Who's ever put Mad Milk on is actually a super help right now.

181
00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:02,600
Dude, I'm going up top.

182
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,600
I'm getting bird's eye view of this whole thing.

183
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,600
Oh, we got a tank.

184
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,899
Oh, I'm out of ammo.

185
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:08,899
There's ammo at the top, right?

186
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:10,899
You gotta spin something.

187
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:15,190
Mom's going back.

188
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:18,190
Does the tank have the normal amount of tank health?

189
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,190
I'm not sure.

190
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,190
Oh, those scouts are so accurate.

191
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,820
Oh no.

192
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,570
Out of ammo.

193
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:29,570
Oh, there's ammo in here.

194
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,570
This is so intense.

195
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,570
I'm writing like a whole thing in my diary about this afterwards.

196
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:41,820
Sentry buster.

197
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,820
Get rid of that tank.

198
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:51,710
Too intense.

199
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:56,559
Another tank?

200
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:58,559
Holy crap.

201
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:01,340
Oh, I got no ammo.

202
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,340
Give me, give me, give me.

203
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,340
Well, this first tank's almost down.

204
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,340
There's a scout on the side with the bomb.

205
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,340
You can't let him bomb it because if he bombs it, I think that's what makes us lose.

206
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,340
Is when people use a bomb.

207
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,769
Oh boy, yeah, he's got it.

208
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:15,769
Yep, they have scouts about to score him.

209
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:19,909
No.

210
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:20,909
Wow.

211
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:22,909
While I'm happy for that scout, kill him.

212
00:10:22,909 --> 00:10:24,909
Well, that was very close.

213
00:10:24,909 --> 00:10:29,340
I'm glad Star Fidget out that they were about to score it.

214
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,340
Yeah, I always keep track of who's scoring and who's not scoring.

215
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,100
Yeah, that's good.

216
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,100
There again.

217
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,100
These guys got crits.

218
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,659
Wow.

219
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:43,659
I warn you, you should actually really, really get crit resistance for this wave as soon as you can.

220
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:45,659
Because it reduces damage on like everything.

221
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:47,659
By the way, they have two tanks that have zero damage done to them.

222
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:48,659
Hey, watch it, scout, scout, scout.

223
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:50,830
I got an ammo scout on the point.

224
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:51,830
Wow, that was good.

225
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:58,320
Good pyro.

226
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,320
Oh, that's fine.

227
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,320
Wow.

228
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,320
There's a tank right here that has like almost full health.

229
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,820
I still got time.

230
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,580
I got to go get crit booster to kill this thing.

231
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:25,100
Bomb him.

232
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,100
Out of ammo again.

233
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,100
We're missing money.

234
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,299
Worry about that instead.

235
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:33,480
I need the money.

236
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,480
I'm out of ammo.

237
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,230
My children.

238
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,559
Yeah, that money back there.

239
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:42,629
Yeah, we got this tank stuff.

240
00:11:42,629 --> 00:11:44,629
Got another one literally right around the corner though.

241
00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:50,149
We're doing a lot better than I thought we would.

242
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:53,649
I did like the outro for the video already.

243
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:56,080
Wait, what?

244
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,080
I told everyone that I hope they enjoyed the video.

245
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,519
I exploded.

246
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:05,519
Oh, no.

247
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,519
Damn it.

248
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:08,700
Oh, you taunting scout.

249
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:20,220
Oh, wow.

250
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,220
Smoke him.

251
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:26,330
Yeah, that's not strong.

252
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:31,429
Nice job.

253
00:12:31,429 --> 00:12:32,429
Give me that ammo.

254
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:33,740
Okay, bombs going back soon too.

255
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,740
So I'm going to try and move my sentry up as soon as that goes right.

256
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,490
Diddle.

257
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:43,789
Oh, a lot of these scouts.

258
00:12:43,789 --> 00:12:47,019
Give me the health.

259
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:48,019
Give me the health.

260
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:49,190
Give me the health.

261
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,190
Did you just say these scouts are super good?

262
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,190
Wait, what?

263
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,190
Oh, my God.

264
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,190
These bots are just.

265
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,190
Dude, these scouts are good.

266
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:01,620
They've got probably got a lot of playing time.

267
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,620
All right, we got like a second or two.

268
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,620
All right.

269
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,059
Yeah.

270
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:08,059
You got a second or two.

271
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:11,679
Bunch of big demos.

272
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:12,679
Did I get spies?

273
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:14,820
No.

274
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,570
Get those crits.

275
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,570
Oh, look at that barrage of death coming towards us.

276
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,570
So much spam, I know.

277
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:25,000
Oh, oh, oh.

278
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Oh, you should name it Sandy.

279
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Goodness.

280
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Oh, too soon.

281
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Actually, not soon enough.

282
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It hasn't happened yet.

283
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Great damage.

284
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
There we go.

285
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I know, but I thought about it ahead of time.

286
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,539
Another tank.

287
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:43,549
Oh, these these guys are.

288
00:13:43,549 --> 00:13:45,919
Oh, my God.

289
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:46,919
Danny bots too good.

290
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:48,669
Oh, that's not good.

291
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:49,669
That's not good.

292
00:13:49,669 --> 00:13:53,019
That's not good.

293
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:54,019
Got to get rid of this guy.

294
00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:57,860
Oh, there's another tank in here.

295
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,860
Oh, they're about to like score kind of.

296
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,860
Well, you should kill them.

297
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,860
Oh, we got it.

298
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,860
I'm trying.

299
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,860
They're killing me.

300
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,860
Oh, there's a lot of demos here.

301
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:12,929
Oh, oh, get up.

302
00:14:12,929 --> 00:14:16,169
Oh, I thought he died.

303
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:18,169
Well, not your friends anymore.

304
00:14:18,169 --> 00:14:20,169
Oh, dude, he died.

305
00:14:20,169 --> 00:14:21,169
He like exploded.

306
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:24,559
Oh, well, poop.

307
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:27,179
It was a good attempt, though.

308
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:31,620
I mean, we only got to like 30 or 40 percent down, but that's intense.

309
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,620
That is crazy.

310
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,559
So that is going to wrap up the video, guys.

311
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:37,559
Thank you all so much for watching.

312
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:38,559
I really do appreciate it.

313
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:41,559
And wave 666 is no joke.

314
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:46,559
So while you have the time, while the event is still going, I'm not sure if they are going to end it or not.

315
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:48,559
They probably will still have it able to be selected.

316
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,559
But go try it out for yourselves.

317
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:53,559
If you complete it, congratulations to you because it is pretty difficult.

318
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,559
So, again, thank you so much for watching.

319
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:56,559
And I'll see you guys all next time.

320
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:59,559
And, of course, take care, everybody.
