1
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:26,100
Time for balloons. Hmm. Smash Brothers? Flave Worms. Alright, that sounds kind of fun to me.

2
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:35,270
What do they got for balloons here? They have balloons too. We're gonna get like the good,

3
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:59,240
the fun one. GeoGuessr? Have you guys played GeoGuessr? BTD5. Alright, let's get it open.

4
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:11,500
You guys can play this one. You guys can play one level of this one. Me versus you guys,

5
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:23,829
tic-tac-toe. Now this guy's got a black bar on the side of his stream, which sucks. Alright,

6
00:01:23,829 --> 00:01:30,890
so I have a... I think I know how to play this game, kind of. So I'm gonna let you guys decide

7
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:49,659
what the hell to do. Let me get this on the screen. I don't need to see that down there.

8
00:01:49,659 --> 00:02:02,599
Make sure it's big enough. Let's turn off the BRB screen, get the audio on here. Actually,

9
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:13,770
I need to... Speaking of audio, because this is extraordinarily loud. That's better. Now

10
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:27,689
we can actually hear what's going on. Okay, so where are we going? Did we just play him?

11
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:45,289
Td6. No, we're on td5. We're gonna play. That's what everybody wants.

12
00:02:46,099 --> 00:03:07,939
Play. New game. Okay, good luck. Here we go. This actually matters. Well, beginner,

13
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:14,280
we got... This is very evenly split here. It looks like we're going this way.

14
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:44,360
I'll give you a minute. Alright, it's time to close this. Whoa! No, it's Jesus!

15
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,360
What is... Oh, it's because I have the fucking click thing wrong. Hold on.

16
00:03:51,419 --> 00:04:07,500
Alright, do it again. People were just spam clicking. Surprising that this is... This

17
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:18,470
is the hardest decision of the whole night, apparently. Alright, that's it. Let's go to

18
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:40,569
space. I can't even select Apocalypse, guys. Please do easy. I don't even... It's

19
00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:54,920
gonna take so long for you guys to figure this out. Alright, we're going hard. On hard,

20
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:04,040
your towers cost more than normal. Alright, just... Alright, well, how long do we have

21
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:10,389
to the waves? They're gonna come from this way. Alright, so we're gonna do Dark

22
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:28,519
Monkey. Dark Monkey. Where? I can't put him... I can't put him right in the middle.

23
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:51,910
Right there? Alright, he's going right there. Now what? Yo, what is the solar system,

24
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:57,850
by the way? This is very crowded. Alright, where's it going?

25
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:18,149
Okay, I love and hate everything about what we're doing right now.

26
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:43,860
Okay, clear it. Is it time to go? Looks like it's time to go. Alright, clear it. Here comes wave

27
00:06:43,860 --> 00:07:14,199
one. Speed it up. Okay, we gotta rank up. We unlocked a new tower. Share it on Facebook.

28
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:42,040
No, I'm not fucking doing that. What? No, this... You can't... Okay, level up,

29
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:56,470
Dark Monkey leveled up. Now what? I fucking love this so much. Are we adding a tower

30
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:11,290
or are we upgrading? I don't know. I don't know. Looks like people want to go over here.

31
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:42,120
Alright, we're doing the tac shooter. Where's it going? I can't put it here. Okay. Like,

32
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:57,690
right here? This is where... I can't get it on top of him. Alright, now what? Which one of

33
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:14,070
these am I upgrading? This one? Okay, no, no, no, no. People want to start. Let's go. Speed

34
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:23,659
it up already. Some of them are gonna get through. Zoom for better selection. Alright, hold on.

35
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:34,090
Let me see if I can get this in a better spot. We could... I guess we could cut off the bottom

36
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:51,059
here. Like this, right? Technically. You guys need that information for anything?

37
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:09,139
No, no, no. You need the information. Alright, well... Son of a fuck. Alright,

38
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:23,340
that... You can see that, right? Alright, let's go. A hundred percent. Every single person is

39
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:30,710
clicking here. Alright, upgrade. Long dart range. Makes the dart monkey shoot further than normal.

40
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:42,809
Got it. Now what? Have I ever played Bloons? Oh yeah, I know, but I'm not playing Bloons

41
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:53,940
right now. I am just a vessel for you guys to decide what you're gonna do. Here we go.

42
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:12,870
Everyone just clicks on that. Like, come on, let's go! Okay, dart monkey level up.

43
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:20,740
Rank up for sniper monkey. Let's go ahead. I'm not sharing it on Facebook.

44
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:46,019
Hmm, it could be any one of these. Okay. I'm selecting this one. Now what?

45
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:12,039
No, that's not the right one. The other one. Okay, I got the other one. Hold on,

46
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:32,440
hold on, everyone. Don't click yet. Okay, now click. Alright, looks like we're upgrading

47
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:46,490
this guy. Good choice. Alright, why would you make me upgrade and then sell it?

48
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:21,639
Uh, okay. If you want to vote, just click the screen. This can only go for so much longer.

49
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:40,700
Alright, enough people came in. Upgrade. Closing the poll in 10 seconds. Alright,

50
00:13:40,700 --> 00:14:14,340
that's it. Alright, let's go. And more speed. Okay, the first green Bloons are coming next.

51
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:53,129
Alright, looks like sell, attack, or go. Looks like it's gonna be go. Yeah, let's go.

52
00:14:53,129 --> 00:15:05,980
Alright, you got a boomerang thrower. Reset it here. I think, I think that's the, yeah,

53
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:12,570
the attack. Tack shooter. What are you, I can't do anything. We can't do anything with the tack

54
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:30,700
shooter. What are you talking about? Sell. Sell it? Damn. Alright, this is a unanimous.

55
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:49,860
Refreshing. Three, two, one. Oh, dear. This is, this is too close. I don't know

56
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:56,090
which one these people are clicking on. I don't, I have no idea. I have to zoom in for

57
00:15:56,090 --> 00:16:32,059
this. Hold on. Hey, welcome to the 12 hour fucking Bloons tower defense stream. Alright,

58
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:47,289
looks like we've got a boomerang, boomerang thrower. Nice choice. The tack, the tack is

59
00:16:47,289 --> 00:17:19,299
stealing votes. Why? Are you, what are you guys talking about? Use the windows zoom tool?

60
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:27,240
Well, I don't think that's gonna work. Wait, does magnifying glass even in Windows 10?

61
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,609
I wonder if that'll work. Alright, boomerang thrower. Let me get that out here,

62
00:17:37,609 --> 00:17:51,420
because this is a huge pain in the ass. Yeah, this is actually, that's a great idea,

63
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:59,430
because then I could just put the, it doesn't go much smoother. Yeah, check this. Okay.

64
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:10,539
Magnifying glass. Magnifier. Is that gonna show up? Oh, my God. No, no, no, no, no. Back.

65
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:26,140
What the fuck is that? Lens. There we go. I don't think this is gonna work. Okay,

66
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:41,029
let's see. Ready? Uh, this isn't doing anything. Yeah, you guys can't see it.

67
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:57,240
This map is hard. Oh, wait a minute. Can you see this? Oh, shit, you can't see it. That's

68
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:05,190
unfortunate because it's zoomed in right now. Damn it. That's unfortunate. Capture the

69
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:14,859
magnifier window in OBS. This is like lagging the computer too. Fuck. Oh, well.

70
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:26,019
I wonder if I can do this. I have an idea. Yeah, here's an idea. I'm gonna screenshot

71
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:29,140
this and then I'm gonna make a huge image and I'm gonna cut to it.

72
00:19:32,869 --> 00:19:36,150
Please turn off the music. Um, that's, that has to come to a vote.

73
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:53,289
All right, let me get the screenshot in the right place. Uh, can you guys even,

74
00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:56,089
you can't even click it. All right, well, you guys are clicking it.

75
00:19:56,089 --> 00:19:59,210
All right, give me one second while I get this image. This will actually work.

76
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:15,779
This will actually work. So let's do a print screen and okay, crop this out.

77
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:20,730
So then you can actually select it and I can make it huge.

78
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:49,619
Yeah, that's much better. Much, much better. Okay, side panel, add image, side panel.

79
00:20:52,180 --> 00:21:26,700
There it is. How am I going to make it? Okay, somehow this is worse. All right.

80
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,619
So whenever we want to do this, I'm going to put that on screen. Look at that.

81
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:41,259
Better. All right. You ready to play? Where would you like me to go?

82
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:46,089
Oh, if you want a tower, then here's what you have to do. If you want a new tower,

83
00:21:46,089 --> 00:21:59,319
you guys have to click here, like over here, and then I'll bring up the new, the window.

84
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:04,279
All right. Looks like people want a tower. All right. Let's clear that.

85
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:22,009
Do it again. Where would you like it? This is all right.

86
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:27,420
I can only do this for so much longer before I have to stop.

87
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:31,589
All right. You got the, just making sure it works. So we're going to do boomerang.

88
00:22:31,589 --> 00:22:53,779
Where would you like the boomerang to go? This is the worst stream ever.

89
00:22:53,779 --> 00:23:01,529
I actually like, think this is, I've actually have like a good time.

90
00:23:01,529 --> 00:23:17,640
Reset it. Do it again. All right. It looks like you want them down here.

91
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,500
Can I, I can't even fit them here. Can I? Okay. That's where it's going.

92
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:37,619
And you click here. I can't do anything else with him. What am I supposed to do?

93
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:47,380
Somebody said I'm too drunk for this. All right. Here it comes.

94
00:23:47,380 --> 00:24:08,980
Good placement, guys. Good placement. We did it. We did it.

95
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:43,099
Congratulations. We did it. Really? You brought him in for one turn.

96
00:24:43,099 --> 00:25:10,059
Now my fucking God. All right. Now you want a new tower.

97
00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:14,970
No, a new tower now is what I want. Give me a new tower.

98
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:25,799
I'll take one, please. What could you possibly,

99
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:34,410
you're not going to buy the boomerang again. You guys are out of your fucking minds.

100
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:44,150
Why? Where would you like me to put them?

101
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:10,170
Well, this is turning out to be a fucking huge waste of time.

102
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:15,140
Anything else? Three, two, one.

103
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:37,160
Why would you do this? This is not even, this is not even interesting.

104
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:57,099
Okay. Hmm. Let's buy another tower. That sounds like fun.

105
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:05,000
Sniper attack? No, boomerang again. Boomerang? Nice.

106
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,150
All right. So, I mean, where should I put them?

107
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:13,670
That's, you know, important. The placement of the character.

108
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:28,069
Where should you go? Okay. Pretty good spot for him, I think.

109
00:27:28,069 --> 00:27:34,500
Are we going to play? Or are you going to keep, we're going to keep this up?

110
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,009
We're going to play the round?

111
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:54,579
There's an equal amount of people that are like sick of this.

112
00:27:54,579 --> 00:28:02,259
Yep. There it is. Donezo. Let's play.

113
00:28:02,259 --> 00:28:13,690
Oh, I can't, let's skip. That's my favorite part about this whole thing.

114
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:20,460
That's how quickly everybody goes right to the fast forward button.

115
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:27,339
All right, rank up. We got road spikes. There's a new, a new thing over here.

116
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:37,369
Here we go. Road spikes looks pretty popular.

117
00:28:37,369 --> 00:28:57,480
No, I'm not going to share it. You guys already bought Pikachu socks

118
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,160
and a giant, like 25 inch whale.

119
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:17,539
All right. So where, you want whale spikes? Where are they going?

120
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:20,819
You want them here. Where do you want these?

121
00:29:20,819 --> 00:29:36,309
You don't want them. Why is everybody clicking here?

122
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:49,690
Spikes are on go. That didn't do, no. What?

123
00:29:50,329 --> 00:29:54,579
Where do you want me to put these spikes?

124
00:29:54,579 --> 00:30:08,819
Okay. I'm going to clear this because I don't think you get this is correct.

125
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:14,309
Where do you want this to be? Here.

126
00:30:14,309 --> 00:30:30,250
Okay. They're there. Now what?

127
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:39,289
More. More road spikes in the same place.

128
00:30:39,289 --> 00:30:45,849
You sure? Doesn't look like it.

129
00:30:45,849 --> 00:31:01,880
Looks like I'm just clicking the go button. 10 seconds.

130
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:06,490
And that's, that's it. I'm, I'm go. Go.

131
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:20,410
I had to close it right there.

132
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:25,000
All right. Look at the round is over.

133
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,809
That's a lot of balloons. You sure you guys are,

134
00:31:30,809 --> 00:31:32,490
I don't know if you guys are correct about this.

135
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:35,450
We've got a lot. What about the money?

136
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:38,700
Okay. Level up. Dart monkey level up.

137
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:49,960
Unlocked access to enhanced eyesight and access to multi-target.

138
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:58,279
All right. Click on boomerang.

139
00:31:58,279 --> 00:32:04,420
Sure thing. All right.

140
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,660
In three, two, one, we come back.

141
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:17,109
Looks like most people wanted this to be upgraded.

142
00:32:17,109 --> 00:32:21,109
Some of you guys there are funny jokesters, pranksters.

143
00:32:21,109 --> 00:32:26,460
That's fine. All right.

144
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:29,240
We're going to do a multi-target with the boomerang.

145
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:44,019
Anything else? Why am I playing a game I used to play in school

146
00:32:44,019 --> 00:32:54,579
back in the fifth grade? No, I'm resetting this shit.

147
00:32:54,660 --> 00:33:00,359
No. And I did, I somehow made it worse. Why?

148
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:10,700
I'm waiting until at least a thousand votes for this one.

149
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:30,170
700 votes. There we go.

150
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:36,740
Can people double vote? It's one vote per viewer.

151
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:51,109
New tower. Yeah, that's good. New tower.

152
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:52,549
Can we move our vote around?

153
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:54,789
You just click on the screen and it counts as a vote.

154
00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:59,349
Can you click somewhere else to change your vote?

155
00:33:59,349 --> 00:34:08,010
I don't, I don't think so.

156
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:10,170
All right. We're going to take the sniper.

157
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:17,829
Good choice. Pretty good choice, I would say.

158
00:34:17,829 --> 00:34:29,820
Where's it gone? Hmm.

159
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:40,900
Doesn't fit here. It can't go there.

160
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,059
Right here? Why can this not fit here?

161
00:34:43,059 --> 00:34:48,760
Is there a reason why this can't go right here?

162
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:54,099
This is the only place I can put it is right here.

163
00:34:54,099 --> 00:35:01,860
It's got to be on land. Oh, I see. Okay.

164
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,860
Well, this seems like it's the best place to put it.

165
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:08,329
Somewhere like in here. Like right here.

166
00:35:10,869 --> 00:35:12,630
Zoom in? I can't zoom in.

167
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:24,409
All right, right there. Very good.

168
00:35:24,409 --> 00:35:47,190
What's next? Nice try, everybody.

169
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:49,429
4k viewers for a children's game.

170
00:35:49,429 --> 00:36:00,380
All right, here we go. Again.

171
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:04,840
We're just going to go again. Pretty good call.

172
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:16,679
Let's play this game on cool math games.

173
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:18,820
Where we are right now, man.

174
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:22,469
Oh, no, we're not. We're on the actual website.

175
00:36:22,469 --> 00:36:24,789
We're on the Ninja Kiwi website.

176
00:36:24,789 --> 00:36:34,199
What's next? New tower.

177
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:35,800
Unfortunately, I don't have my screenshot.

178
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,000
It doesn't have...

179
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,159
You kind of need to remember where your things are

180
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:41,880
because that... Remember the spot that that's in.

181
00:36:54,780 --> 00:37:00,550
Wow. Not one person has decided to click anywhere else.

182
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,510
That's actually pretty...

183
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,269
Nobody they clicked on the guy's nose over here.

184
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,559
That's crazy.

185
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:09,019
There was almost 600 votes at the same place.

186
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:16,710
Okay, let's put them down.

187
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:32,039
Where is it going?

188
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:33,880
I guess in this general vicinity.

189
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,760
That sounds fine.

190
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:48,010
Like right here.

191
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:52,139
All right, I'm gonna try to get right in the middle.

192
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:55,619
If I even can.

193
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:57,219
Right here. Right there.

194
00:37:57,219 --> 00:38:03,400
It won't hit anything if it's in the middle.

195
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,519
Yeah, right there.

196
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:21,699
All right, let's go.

197
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:23,780
I can't believe this is still going.

198
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,579
Now neither can I.

199
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:44,179
For some reason, I'm still interested in this.

200
00:38:44,179 --> 00:38:46,179
All right, dart monkey leveled up.

201
00:38:46,179 --> 00:38:54,619
What would you like me to do with them?

202
00:38:54,619 --> 00:39:09,909
Okay, I don't understand.

203
00:39:09,909 --> 00:39:11,030
Wrong one.

204
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:17,260
Wait, get... Do it again.

205
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:17,980
This one.

206
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:18,480
Okay.

207
00:39:33,429 --> 00:39:33,929
15%.

208
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:35,289
13%.

209
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,079
36% say they want razor sharp.

210
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:45,530
Could pop two balloons at the same time.

211
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:55,860
All right, again.

212
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,710
Okay, double upgrade it seems.

213
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:10,869
Where are we going from here?

214
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:13,099
All right, speed it up.

215
00:40:13,099 --> 00:40:14,820
Let's see if it was the right call.

216
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,079
Rank seven.

217
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:29,510
Another new tower here.

218
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:35,500
But we don't have any money.

219
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,179
I don't have enough money for that.

220
00:40:38,179 --> 00:40:41,219
Why am I saying me?

221
00:40:41,219 --> 00:40:42,420
This is you guys.

222
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,860
You don't have enough money for this.

223
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:56,039
So what round do you think you guys are going to lose on?

224
00:40:56,519 --> 00:41:03,719
Again.

225
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:06,949
Oh, no, no, this is the...

226
00:41:06,949 --> 00:41:07,909
Hold on a minute here.

227
00:41:07,909 --> 00:41:15,110
Hold on a minute here.

228
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:15,909
A lot of money.

229
00:41:15,909 --> 00:41:18,230
A lot of subs came in too that I missed.

230
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:23,079
I'll make sure I touch upon them when we're done.

231
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:24,360
But thank you so much.

232
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:26,199
M.H. Harmless.

233
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:27,159
Thanks for the $50.

234
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:28,980
Now you have money for it.

235
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,260
Thanks for 50 bucks.

236
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:35,369
That's a huge amount of money, man.

237
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:40,420
Thank you.

238
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,519
It's funny, I don't even have to say anything anymore.

239
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:59,400
I just... Really?

240
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,119
Okay.

241
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:07,670
I don't know why...

242
00:42:08,619 --> 00:42:12,659
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

243
00:42:12,659 --> 00:42:18,619
Not sell strong because you can't click down here.

244
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:21,909
Why not?

245
00:42:21,909 --> 00:42:23,110
You should be able to click down there.

246
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,230
That's kind of stupid.

247
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:26,550
So you want it strong.

248
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:29,300
All right.

249
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:38,280
Strong.

250
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:38,840
Okay.

251
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,309
We got it.

252
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:40,869
We got... We're good.

253
00:42:40,869 --> 00:42:41,110
We're good.

254
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:51,960
Everything's fine.

255
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,800
You guys are doing a really good job.

256
00:42:53,800 --> 00:43:03,289
Start it again.

257
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:05,130
How much longer am I going to do this?

258
00:43:05,989 --> 00:43:06,869
I don't know.

259
00:43:06,869 --> 00:43:11,909
Tonight was real weird.

260
00:43:11,909 --> 00:43:16,250
But whatever.

261
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:16,730
Okay.

262
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:17,849
Let's open that up.

263
00:43:17,849 --> 00:43:23,480
Make sure you know what you're clicking on here.

264
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:36,469
All right.

265
00:43:36,469 --> 00:43:41,940
Looks like we want Cannon.

266
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:54,260
Cannon, where is it going?

267
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:55,139
Losing viewers?

268
00:43:55,139 --> 00:43:56,099
It's all right.

269
00:43:56,099 --> 00:44:02,650
We're just hanging out having fun.

270
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:03,449
Hmm.

271
00:44:03,449 --> 00:44:12,519
Over here or over here?

272
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:16,760
There's a lot of different opinions apparently right now on balloons tower defense.

273
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:22,679
The general consensus for the majority is...

274
00:44:22,679 --> 00:44:23,960
Well, that's not even a...

275
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,219
Yeah.

276
00:44:25,219 --> 00:44:26,380
Right here?

277
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:26,780
All right.

278
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:37,539
Let's go.

279
00:44:37,539 --> 00:44:39,059
Chat is min maxing.

280
00:44:39,059 --> 00:44:44,969
The balloons have a powerful new advancement regrowth.

281
00:44:44,969 --> 00:44:46,969
These balloons are distinguished by their heart shape.

282
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:51,380
If not popped quickly, they will grow layers back to their original size.

283
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,980
Make sure you guys are aware of that.

284
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:57,079
Is that it?

285
00:44:57,079 --> 00:44:58,679
That was the whole round.

286
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:04,460
Okay.

287
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:18,230
Put on some music.

288
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:19,750
Okay.

289
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:20,550
I'll put on some music.

290
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:21,510
That sounds like a good idea.

291
00:45:23,539 --> 00:45:24,340
Rank up.

292
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:24,579
All right.

293
00:45:24,579 --> 00:45:25,300
Let's put music on.

294
00:45:36,699 --> 00:45:37,980
See, this is where it breaks up.

295
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,019
We're on round 20.

296
00:45:39,579 --> 00:45:41,590
Coming up around 19.

297
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:42,949
Look at all these different opinions.

298
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:51,579
This is wild.

299
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:56,789
All right.

300
00:45:56,789 --> 00:45:57,750
Looks like we're going to...

301
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:00,309
Got to go by what the highest percentage is here.

302
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:11,130
I got to reset it.

303
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:12,489
I've already selected this thing.

304
00:46:12,489 --> 00:46:13,449
I've already selected the Cannon.

305
00:46:13,449 --> 00:46:14,010
We're going to reset.

306
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,199
Ready?

307
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,179
Here we go.

308
00:46:21,909 --> 00:46:22,309
Sell it.

309
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:24,920
No, no, no.

310
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:25,159
Okay.

311
00:46:25,159 --> 00:46:25,559
It's not...

312
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:26,280
It's strong.

313
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,400
Is it strong or sell?

314
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:27,960
I can't tell.

315
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:30,469
All right.

316
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:32,710
Selected.

317
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:35,300
Ready?

318
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:36,900
Three, two, one.

319
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:37,619
Here it comes again.

320
00:46:39,159 --> 00:46:40,360
What do you want me to click?

321
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,760
Okay.

322
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:43,639
We got the ninja.

323
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:46,340
All right.

324
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:49,340
Three, two, one.

325
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:49,900
What do I click?

326
00:46:53,139 --> 00:46:56,019
Upgrade discipline, increase attack range, and attack speed.

327
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,780
All right.

328
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:01,860
Three, two, one.

329
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:02,500
Where are we going?

330
00:47:03,139 --> 00:47:06,420
That's all you want to do?

331
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:07,820
Okay.

332
00:47:17,269 --> 00:47:18,469
You guys are good at this game.

333
00:47:18,469 --> 00:47:19,670
You guys are good at this game.

334
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:20,469
This is never going to end.

335
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:27,960
Are we going again?

336
00:47:28,519 --> 00:47:31,059
We're going again.

337
00:47:33,019 --> 00:47:33,579
All right.

338
00:47:33,579 --> 00:47:36,940
Black balloons and white balloons are small but contain two pink balloons when popped.

339
00:47:37,739 --> 00:47:40,300
They're immune to explosions and immune to freezing.

340
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:41,739
Okay.

341
00:47:41,739 --> 00:47:42,699
Got to be careful here.

342
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:50,780
All right.

343
00:47:59,639 --> 00:48:01,719
For 75 IQ, you guys are doing a real good job.

344
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:14,550
All right.

345
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:15,030
New tower.

346
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:28,679
Whatever it was, this is the ice tower down here.

347
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,460
People are still clicking on the tack tower.

348
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:36,340
That's my favorite thing.

349
00:48:37,059 --> 00:48:40,679
All right.

350
00:48:40,679 --> 00:48:41,239
Let's get the ice.

351
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:52,659
Where is he going?

352
00:48:52,659 --> 00:48:57,460
I need to take a new screenshot.

353
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:04,360
Okay.

354
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,800
People are like, save it.

355
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:06,440
Save the game.

356
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,860
We're over here.

357
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:16,460
Right in there is where I can fit it.

358
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:17,820
I can only fit it right here.

359
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:23,099
All right.

360
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:23,500
That's it.

361
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,260
Three, two, one.

362
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:34,820
Waste of money.

363
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:36,460
Sell.

364
00:49:37,179 --> 00:49:41,739
No, we're going, right?

365
00:49:41,739 --> 00:49:42,139
Let's go.

366
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:50,760
Okay.

367
00:49:54,309 --> 00:49:54,789
Save.

368
00:49:54,789 --> 00:49:55,269
Save the game.

369
00:49:56,889 --> 00:49:58,090
Log in to save your game.

370
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:00,570
I don't have an account here so I can't do that.

371
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:03,219
And I click on the ice tower.

372
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:04,820
Ice tower has been clicked.

373
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:14,760
And now what?

374
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,960
You guys just put it down.

375
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,079
It was just put down.

376
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:25,269
Wrong.

377
00:50:25,269 --> 00:50:26,949
This is what you wanted to select.

378
00:50:26,949 --> 00:50:30,579
No range.

379
00:50:30,579 --> 00:50:30,739
No.

380
00:50:30,739 --> 00:50:31,219
This is...

381
00:50:31,219 --> 00:50:31,460
Wait.

382
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:32,500
We can do it again.

383
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,460
What do you want me to select?

384
00:50:34,969 --> 00:50:35,769
Make it really clear.

385
00:50:35,769 --> 00:50:37,449
Make accuracy here.

386
00:50:37,449 --> 00:50:38,010
Accuracy.

387
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:45,900
Fuck.

388
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,260
They're right on top of each other.

389
00:50:52,969 --> 00:50:53,210
That's...

390
00:50:53,769 --> 00:50:54,010
Okay.

391
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:56,329
If it was this one, all the circle would be up here.

392
00:50:59,099 --> 00:50:59,420
Okay.

393
00:50:59,420 --> 00:50:59,900
Now what?

394
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,019
Now it was just put down here.

395
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:12,250
Didn't you guys just put it down?

396
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:20,059
I have to listen.

397
00:51:20,059 --> 00:51:20,300
Okay.

398
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:26,980
What would you like to do now?

399
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:28,099
I placed it wrong.

400
00:51:28,099 --> 00:51:29,300
How did I place it wrong?

401
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,300
I'm going to be going back over here.

402
00:51:32,019 --> 00:51:33,829
Hold on.

403
00:51:33,829 --> 00:51:37,269
Are you guys trying to correct me putting it in the wrong place?

404
00:51:47,159 --> 00:51:47,719
No way.

405
00:51:53,449 --> 00:51:53,929
Really?

406
00:51:59,269 --> 00:51:59,750
Okay.

407
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,750
I'm buying the ice tower right now.

408
00:52:02,309 --> 00:52:04,099
Ice tower.

409
00:52:04,099 --> 00:52:04,980
Let's lower this.

410
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:16,760
And where do you want it?

411
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:20,570
You got to be accurate.

412
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,889
Why do you want it back up here in the same spot?

413
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:25,269
Like here?

414
00:52:25,269 --> 00:52:26,070
Right here.

415
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:39,800
This is...

416
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,500
That's where it's going.

417
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:42,539
Right in the center.

418
00:52:42,539 --> 00:52:43,579
Set like here.

419
00:52:43,579 --> 00:52:50,230
That's not going to hit anything.

420
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:50,869
Need zoom?

421
00:52:50,869 --> 00:52:51,269
All right.

422
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:53,030
We do need zoom for this one apparently.

423
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:54,949
Hold on.

424
00:52:54,949 --> 00:52:59,380
I'm going to zoom the fuck in.

425
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:09,269
Because this is important.

426
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,710
If you guys are making me sell...

427
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:14,940
Okay.

428
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:24,460
Where do you want it?

429
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:25,420
Jesus.

430
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:32,340
It can't even go over here.

431
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:44,840
Okay.

432
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:52,300
I love this.

433
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:54,699
This is so much fun.

434
00:53:54,699 --> 00:53:55,340
I don't know why.

435
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:55,900
Just knowing...

436
00:53:57,719 --> 00:53:58,039
It's...

437
00:53:58,039 --> 00:53:58,599
This is one...

438
00:53:58,599 --> 00:53:59,400
I love this.

439
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:02,010
Okay.

440
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:02,889
Now I have to fix this.

441
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,760
It's just in a worse spot.

442
00:54:21,829 --> 00:54:23,429
You guys have to come to a determination

443
00:54:23,429 --> 00:54:27,769
of where you want me to put the towers, guys.

444
00:54:27,769 --> 00:54:28,650
Okay.

445
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:36,869
Are we ready?

446
00:54:36,869 --> 00:54:37,110
No.

447
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:47,099
You got to be fucking kidding me, guys.

448
00:54:47,099 --> 00:54:53,269
I'm waiting for more participation than this.

449
00:54:53,269 --> 00:54:53,670
Come on.

450
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:53,829
Okay.

451
00:54:53,829 --> 00:54:56,599
There we go.

452
00:54:56,599 --> 00:54:57,079
All right.

453
00:54:57,079 --> 00:54:57,400
With that...

454
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:57,639
Yeah.

455
00:54:57,639 --> 00:54:59,400
We're about over 3,000 now.

456
00:54:59,400 --> 00:54:59,880
Go.

457
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:09,739
Okay.

458
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:14,659
Did the ice even do anything?

459
00:55:14,659 --> 00:55:19,480
I don't think the ice did anything.

460
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:19,719
All right.

461
00:55:19,719 --> 00:55:23,480
Well, we're at 23 of 85.

462
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:24,519
You guys are almost...

463
00:55:24,519 --> 00:55:27,000
We're getting close to being in a place.

464
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,670
A good spot.

465
00:55:33,050 --> 00:55:33,690
All right.

466
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:34,809
I need some clarification.

467
00:55:34,809 --> 00:55:37,210
Are you trying to click on the dart or the ice?

468
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:38,090
I think you're trying to click...

469
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:39,050
I don't know.

470
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:40,329
Am I going to have to zoom in again?

471
00:55:40,329 --> 00:55:53,050
I feel like it's 50-50.

472
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:53,449
All right.

473
00:55:53,449 --> 00:55:53,849
If you...

474
00:55:53,849 --> 00:55:54,010
Okay.

475
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:55,369
Here's how it's going to work.

476
00:55:55,369 --> 00:55:56,329
I'm going to refresh it.

477
00:55:56,329 --> 00:55:58,489
If you want the ice tower to be selected,

478
00:55:58,489 --> 00:56:00,730
you got to click over by the sun.

479
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:01,690
If you want the dart,

480
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:02,809
you got to click like up here.

481
00:56:02,809 --> 00:56:05,079
Like over here.

482
00:56:05,079 --> 00:56:08,739
All right.

483
00:56:08,739 --> 00:56:09,139
Reset...

484
00:56:09,139 --> 00:56:17,449
Resetting it.

485
00:56:17,449 --> 00:56:18,250
Ice it looks like.

486
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:18,489
Okay.

487
00:56:22,969 --> 00:56:23,289
All right.

488
00:56:23,289 --> 00:56:23,929
Selecting ice.

489
00:56:24,489 --> 00:56:29,269
I'm assuming we're going to do an upgrade for this.

490
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:35,420
Guys.

491
00:56:47,349 --> 00:56:48,070
It's...

492
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:48,789
Sell it.

493
00:56:48,789 --> 00:56:52,539
It's trash.

494
00:56:52,539 --> 00:56:53,579
It's not a joke.

495
00:56:53,579 --> 00:56:54,219
It's bad.

496
00:56:54,219 --> 00:57:00,420
Well, how is it voted for in the first place?

497
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:01,699
I've sold this before.

498
00:57:01,699 --> 00:57:04,119
And then you guys bought it again

499
00:57:04,119 --> 00:57:06,280
and made sure it was in the correct placement.

500
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:20,809
And now 70% of you want to sell it.

501
00:57:20,809 --> 00:57:21,130
Okay?

502
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:29,929
Stop asking questions, vessel.

503
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:34,789
Okay.

504
00:57:34,789 --> 00:57:43,159
Another tower.

505
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:45,639
So this looks like it's going to be...

506
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:49,260
Is that...

507
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:50,139
That's a ninja?

508
00:57:50,139 --> 00:57:57,579
I think that's a ninja.

509
00:57:57,579 --> 00:57:57,980
Yeah.

510
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:07,420
That's very clearly over the ninja.

511
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:08,059
Okay.

512
00:58:08,059 --> 00:58:21,980
Where's it going?

513
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:22,539
Over here.

514
00:58:27,449 --> 00:58:31,460
I'm going to try to get it as close in the circle as I can.

515
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:32,980
Wherever the center of this circle is,

516
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:36,099
is where it's going.

517
00:58:36,099 --> 00:58:42,940
Right there.

518
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:43,579
Enhance.

519
00:58:43,579 --> 00:58:45,780
Enhance.

520
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:46,820
How do you vote?

521
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:48,099
You just have to enable the extension

522
00:58:48,099 --> 00:58:49,219
and you just click on the screen.

523
00:58:49,219 --> 00:58:53,590
That looks good.

524
00:58:53,590 --> 00:58:59,800
We almost time...

525
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:00,760
It's almost time for round...

526
00:59:01,639 --> 00:59:03,800
Round like 30.

527
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,320
Round 20, whatever it is.

528
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:11,079
Oh damn.

529
00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:11,480
All right.

530
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:12,760
Looks like I know what people want to do.

531
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:17,269
All right.

532
00:59:17,269 --> 00:59:21,690
What's next?

533
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:23,130
Round 23 of 85.

534
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:23,690
Incoming.

535
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:39,940
Fucking easy.

536
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:40,420
Again?

537
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:42,409
Okay.

538
00:59:42,409 --> 00:59:44,090
Camo balloons are very dangerous

539
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:45,690
since most towers cannot hit them.

540
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:48,550
Any balloon types can also be camo balloon

541
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:50,710
and so will all the balloons that come out of that one.

542
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:53,849
They can only be hit by towers that can detect camo.

543
00:59:53,849 --> 00:59:55,050
All other attacks will miss.

544
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:57,530
If you do not have any towers that can detect camo,

545
00:59:57,530 --> 01:00:08,940
use road spikes.

546
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:10,360
Nice.

547
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:12,389
Bomb tower level up.

548
01:00:12,389 --> 01:00:13,429
Access to extra range.

549
01:00:15,559 --> 01:00:18,920
And a glue gunner has been unlocked.

550
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,260
All right.

551
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:23,019
Any changes that you guys would like to make?

552
01:00:30,489 --> 01:00:31,289
We're not sharing.

553
01:00:31,289 --> 01:00:32,250
We're never going to share it.

554
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:37,960
All right.

555
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:38,920
New tower.

556
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:43,860
So make sure you remember where those slots are.

557
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:47,449
You see?

558
01:00:47,449 --> 01:00:47,769
Got it?

559
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:48,409
You see where they are?

560
01:00:58,230 --> 01:01:05,510
Glue is being 100%ed right here.

561
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:06,710
Move the picture to the left.

562
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:08,920
Okay.

563
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,519
So it's easier to click on.

564
01:01:10,519 --> 01:01:15,340
So the glue was selected.

565
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:24,599
I don't think I've ever played this game this long

566
01:01:24,599 --> 01:01:28,099
to see what this even does.

567
01:01:28,099 --> 01:01:30,019
But you've got glue now.

568
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:40,440
Where would you like to put it?

569
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:41,000
Up here.

570
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:41,480
Up here.

571
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:42,519
Oof.

572
01:01:42,519 --> 01:01:43,480
Over here.

573
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:48,570
What's the extension called?

574
01:01:50,389 --> 01:01:51,269
Smart map.

575
01:01:52,329 --> 01:01:53,050
Smart map.

576
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:54,570
Smart click maps is what it's called.

577
01:01:55,769 --> 01:02:01,000
You should be able to just activate it from your...

578
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,579
You just have to click a button, don't you?

579
01:02:03,579 --> 01:02:04,139
I don't know.

580
01:02:04,139 --> 01:02:04,619
This is too...

581
01:02:04,619 --> 01:02:05,179
I got to go in.

582
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:05,980
We got to zoom in here.

583
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:11,099
In fact, you know, I'm going to take a screenshot of this too.

584
01:02:11,099 --> 01:02:12,219
And so we can zoom into it.

585
01:02:12,219 --> 01:02:13,739
Because it's been so conflicted.

586
01:02:14,789 --> 01:02:15,349
Print screen.

587
01:02:15,989 --> 01:02:16,789
Give me a second.

588
01:02:28,469 --> 01:02:32,710
Let's just get the area here so I can zoom way in.

589
01:02:32,710 --> 01:02:39,500
Okay.

590
01:02:40,219 --> 01:02:41,260
Let's get it on there.

591
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:49,050
All right.

592
01:02:49,050 --> 01:02:50,409
So we're going to do it like this.

593
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:54,010
So it's easier for you guys to select fine...

594
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:56,780
Finite details.

595
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:57,179
Okay.

596
01:02:57,179 --> 01:03:06,340
So where do you want it to go?

597
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:12,699
Sorry.

598
01:03:12,699 --> 01:03:13,659
Right in the middle there.

599
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:18,889
All right.

600
01:03:18,889 --> 01:03:19,369
I...

601
01:03:19,369 --> 01:03:20,170
Right there.

602
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:22,420
Right in the middle.

603
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:26,619
You got it.

604
01:03:26,619 --> 01:03:29,510
All right.

605
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:35,880
So you wanted it right here.

606
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:38,119
Right there.

607
01:03:38,119 --> 01:03:39,400
That's as close as I can get it.

608
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:46,250
That's actually the worst spot.

609
01:03:47,579 --> 01:03:47,980
Why?

610
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:48,380
What?

611
01:03:48,380 --> 01:04:07,289
Surprisingly, I haven't even lost one life yet.

612
01:04:07,289 --> 01:04:08,969
How have you guys not lost one life?

613
01:04:08,969 --> 01:04:12,340
That's kind of ridiculous.

614
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:18,059
Indecisive.

615
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:24,090
It's going again.

616
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:30,739
Uh oh.

617
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:39,300
All right.

618
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:46,260
Ninja Monkey leveled up.

619
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:46,739
Now what?

620
01:04:48,329 --> 01:04:49,449
We're going to have to enhance this.

621
01:04:49,449 --> 01:04:51,449
I have no idea what you guys want me to do.

622
01:04:51,449 --> 01:05:06,969
It's restarting in three, two, one.

623
01:05:06,969 --> 01:05:13,659
I think that's click on the ninja, right?

624
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:14,139
Yep.

625
01:05:14,139 --> 01:05:19,369
It's the middle one right there.

626
01:05:19,369 --> 01:05:19,769
Yep.

627
01:05:19,769 --> 01:05:30,139
Okay.

628
01:05:30,139 --> 01:05:30,780
Upgrade.

629
01:05:31,909 --> 01:05:32,710
Yep.

630
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:33,800
Sounds good to me.

631
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:46,409
Okay.

632
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:59,480
I got the other ninja selected.

633
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:00,199
All right.

634
01:06:00,199 --> 01:06:03,530
Upgrade this one to Seeking.

635
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:06,380
Oh, Selen!

636
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:16,010
There's a small percentage of you guys

637
01:06:16,010 --> 01:06:23,960
that really want that sniper upgrade.

638
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:28,179
But I'm going to have to refresh here.

639
01:06:28,179 --> 01:06:37,110
I don't know what's going on.

640
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:37,829
Sniper.

641
01:06:37,829 --> 01:06:47,260
Sniper selected.

642
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:55,030
Three, two, one.

643
01:06:55,030 --> 01:06:55,750
All right.

644
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:57,429
Shoots can pop through four layers of blue

645
01:06:57,429 --> 01:06:59,429
and it can pop lead and frozen blue.

646
01:06:59,429 --> 01:07:03,900
All right.

647
01:07:10,619 --> 01:07:12,219
Now it's time for the cannon.

648
01:07:12,219 --> 01:07:14,650
Cannon unlockables?

649
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:14,969
Shoots?

650
01:07:14,969 --> 01:07:15,449
What do you mean?

651
01:07:15,449 --> 01:07:21,210
Shoots.

652
01:07:21,210 --> 01:07:21,449
Okay.

653
01:07:21,449 --> 01:07:22,250
I got the cannon on.

654
01:07:33,219 --> 01:07:34,019
Okay.

655
01:07:34,019 --> 01:07:37,510
Preparing yourselves for the next round.

656
01:07:37,510 --> 01:07:38,469
You puny vessel.

657
01:07:38,469 --> 01:07:40,309
You're no match for the hive mind.

658
01:07:40,309 --> 01:07:42,760
We'll take over your computer.

659
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:45,480
Like those people in the unfriended horror movie.

660
01:07:50,019 --> 01:07:50,820
Lead bloons are slow,

661
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:52,099
but they're immune to anything sharp.

662
01:07:52,099 --> 01:07:54,739
They contain two black bloons when popped.

663
01:07:54,739 --> 01:08:01,510
That was fucking easy.

664
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:13,480
How have you guys done this so well?

665
01:08:15,590 --> 01:08:17,270
Seriously, how is this possible?

666
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:28,460
More?

667
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:29,500
We're going to go again.

668
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:38,390
Am I going to stream World of Light?

669
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:38,710
Yeah.

670
01:08:38,710 --> 01:08:42,310
I'm probably going to play Smash Brothers tomorrow.

671
01:08:42,310 --> 01:08:43,829
Next round, many zebra bloons.

672
01:08:43,829 --> 01:08:44,710
Are we prepared for this?

673
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:55,369
People want to go.

674
01:08:55,369 --> 01:08:59,930
Got some nervous people in the chat though.

675
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:00,649
Nervous?

676
01:09:00,649 --> 01:09:13,319
Why are you so nervous?

677
01:09:13,319 --> 01:09:20,890
All right.

678
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:21,369
I did it.

679
01:09:21,369 --> 01:09:22,250
It had to do it.

680
01:09:30,619 --> 01:09:32,140
Everybody's clicking on tacks.

681
01:09:37,659 --> 01:09:38,699
Glue gunner leveled up.

682
01:09:38,699 --> 01:09:41,210
Glue soaks through all layers of blue.

683
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:50,840
And exploding pineapples.

684
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:51,880
This guy.

685
01:09:51,880 --> 01:10:01,590
What would you like me to do with this guy?

686
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:02,470
We want the upgrade.

687
01:10:02,470 --> 01:10:03,109
Okay.

688
01:10:03,109 --> 01:10:05,420
12%.

689
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:18,420
Always sell.

690
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:20,100
Strong, strong, strong.

691
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:25,609
Okay.

692
01:10:25,609 --> 01:10:27,850
Selected strong.

693
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:40,539
Boomerang upgrades.

694
01:10:40,539 --> 01:10:41,340
Sniper guys.

695
01:10:43,079 --> 01:10:44,600
I have no say in this.

696
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:49,159
I'm only here to click buttons on the screen.

697
01:10:49,159 --> 01:10:52,920
That's the only reason why I'm here.

698
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:54,090
Okay.

699
01:10:54,090 --> 01:10:56,899
Make sure you see where you want these towers.

700
01:10:56,899 --> 01:10:57,460
Because they're...

701
01:10:57,460 --> 01:10:58,100
Here we go.

702
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:12,539
It's a good reference to see where they are.

703
01:11:12,539 --> 01:11:13,579
Sniper tower.

704
01:11:13,579 --> 01:11:27,539
It's currently destroying.

705
01:11:27,539 --> 01:11:28,819
Okay.

706
01:11:28,819 --> 01:11:36,439
Selected.

707
01:11:36,439 --> 01:11:38,119
You want to know a funny tidbit of information?

708
01:11:40,119 --> 01:11:47,430
This would be the only time I would ever have beaten anything on this game.

709
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:50,100
We might need an enhance here.

710
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:51,699
You guys are beating this while I'm clicking...

711
01:11:51,699 --> 01:11:53,539
It's on my computer so it's technically mine.

712
01:11:53,539 --> 01:11:55,130
Right, it's on my console.

713
01:11:55,130 --> 01:11:59,899
So it's mine.

714
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:02,920
Technically.

715
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:07,560
Well, yeah, I got to enhance this.

716
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:19,159
Do it again.

717
01:12:19,159 --> 01:12:20,119
Right in the middle there.

718
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:23,979
68%.

719
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:26,380
Yeah, just about 70%.

720
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:31,270
It's going to go right in the middle there.

721
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:37,930
I'm the host for the hive mine.

722
01:12:37,930 --> 01:12:45,060
All right, it's going to go right there.

723
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:47,289
Right here.

724
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:50,520
Right here.

725
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:51,560
Close enough, right?

726
01:12:51,560 --> 01:13:05,460
Looks like right there.

727
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:06,100
Click them again.

728
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:08,180
And then upgrade.

729
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:09,539
I see what you guys are doing.

730
01:13:09,539 --> 01:13:10,579
I see the...

731
01:13:10,579 --> 01:13:12,500
I see.

732
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:16,699
Okay.

733
01:13:16,699 --> 01:13:19,020
I'm just coming to this crazy realization.

734
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:28,920
Any one of you guys could open this up right now and play it.

735
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:34,859
And then put it on strong.

736
01:13:34,859 --> 01:13:37,859
Anybody could just open this.

737
01:13:37,859 --> 01:13:43,640
Why are we all sitting here doing this?

738
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:44,520
We are playing.

739
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:44,920
That's right.

740
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:45,560
That's true.

741
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:59,479
All right, good luck.

742
01:13:59,479 --> 01:14:00,279
More dangerous.

743
01:14:00,279 --> 01:14:00,779
Uh-oh.

744
01:14:01,319 --> 01:14:14,869
Jesus.

745
01:14:14,869 --> 01:14:16,069
Give me a fucking break.

746
01:14:16,069 --> 01:14:17,750
Okay, so we're upgrading.

747
01:14:19,189 --> 01:14:22,199
The collective is clicking here.

748
01:14:22,199 --> 01:14:22,840
Oh, wait a minute.

749
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:33,479
Hold on.

750
01:14:33,479 --> 01:14:34,279
All right.

751
01:14:34,279 --> 01:14:39,609
All right, I got them selected.

752
01:14:39,609 --> 01:14:40,409
Upgrade.

753
01:14:40,409 --> 01:14:54,810
I can talk to my mother on the phone later.

754
01:14:54,810 --> 01:14:56,779
Oh, what did you do today?

755
01:14:56,779 --> 01:15:05,210
I sat in a chair and 4,000 people yelled at me and clicked on a screen for me to

756
01:15:06,170 --> 01:15:09,939
monkeys down for a tower defense game.

757
01:15:09,939 --> 01:15:16,810
Oh.

758
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:18,010
And then we're upgrading this?

759
01:15:25,210 --> 01:15:32,090
I guess so.

760
01:15:32,090 --> 01:15:34,329
What else would you like to do with your turn chat?

761
01:15:34,329 --> 01:15:39,510
I'm seeing a lot of just goes.

762
01:15:39,510 --> 01:15:44,970
Okay.

763
01:15:44,970 --> 01:15:46,859
Let's hope you were right.

764
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:05,270
That looks like it's up here.

765
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:19,720
We got 74% going to the tax.

766
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:20,439
All right.

767
01:16:20,439 --> 01:16:33,880
Where would you like me to put them?

768
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:34,600
I need to refresh.

769
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:41,579
Refresh.

770
01:16:41,579 --> 01:16:43,180
Looks like all down here.

771
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:44,140
I think I'm going to go...

772
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:44,859
How many should I do?

773
01:16:44,859 --> 01:16:45,420
One?

774
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:55,159
Do a whole line?

775
01:16:55,159 --> 01:16:57,239
All right, I'm going to put down one right in the middle.

776
01:16:57,239 --> 01:16:58,680
There's one down there.

777
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:06,329
Is that all you need?

778
01:17:06,329 --> 01:17:12,899
You want another one?

779
01:17:12,899 --> 01:17:18,970
Okay.

780
01:17:18,970 --> 01:17:21,399
More.

781
01:17:21,399 --> 01:17:27,000
55% of you still want me to put them here.

782
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:27,319
Okay.

783
01:17:27,319 --> 01:17:33,430
Refreshing again.

784
01:17:33,430 --> 01:17:37,430
Every time it's refreshed, more and more people are like,

785
01:17:37,430 --> 01:17:38,789
you know, I think that's enough tax.

786
01:17:38,789 --> 01:17:41,000
That looks good.

787
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,199
It really is a collective.

788
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:00,659
You guys are at 34.

789
01:18:01,659 --> 01:18:06,010
Around 34 of 85.

790
01:18:06,010 --> 01:18:06,649
New tower.

791
01:18:06,649 --> 01:18:20,630
It's a good thing we bought those tax.

792
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:20,869
Okay.

793
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:22,390
New tower.

794
01:18:22,390 --> 01:18:29,640
Make sure you see where it is on the screen there.

795
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:34,199
You know, some people pay $15 on consoles to play this.

796
01:18:34,199 --> 01:18:39,180
Yeah, but you're playing it right now for free.

797
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:47,909
It's pretty unanimous.

798
01:18:47,909 --> 01:18:49,590
You guys want the buccaneer.

799
01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:57,289
I don't need to see anything else.

800
01:18:57,289 --> 01:18:58,949
Oops.

801
01:18:58,949 --> 01:19:01,130
Move that away.

802
01:19:01,130 --> 01:19:01,529
All right.

803
01:19:01,529 --> 01:19:02,409
What do you want it?

804
01:19:02,409 --> 01:19:08,069
This might be an enhanced scenario.

805
01:19:08,069 --> 01:19:08,630
It is.

806
01:19:08,630 --> 01:19:12,090
It's going to be an enhanced scenario.

807
01:19:12,090 --> 01:19:14,329
Please just wait till I refresh.

808
01:19:14,329 --> 01:19:38,199
This is where the buccaneer is going.

809
01:19:38,199 --> 01:19:42,819
You can't put them there.

810
01:19:42,819 --> 01:19:43,859
He can fit there.

811
01:19:43,859 --> 01:19:47,699
Yeah, he's going right there.

812
01:19:47,699 --> 01:19:49,449
Thank you for voting.

813
01:19:49,449 --> 01:19:51,449
He's going right in this little channel here.

814
01:19:51,449 --> 01:19:55,060
Right there.

815
01:19:55,060 --> 01:19:56,659
Right there.

816
01:19:56,659 --> 01:19:57,300
All right.

817
01:19:57,300 --> 01:20:04,039
What next?

818
01:20:04,039 --> 01:20:11,350
Didn't this game have music?

819
01:20:11,350 --> 01:20:12,069
Oh, yeah, sure.

820
01:20:12,069 --> 01:20:26,569
All right, here we go.

821
01:20:26,569 --> 01:20:29,260
Which one of these upgrades?

822
01:20:29,260 --> 01:20:30,460
That's the important thing.

823
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:33,109
No, I can't.

824
01:20:33,109 --> 01:20:34,069
No, I can't do that one.

825
01:20:34,069 --> 01:20:40,949
Is that all you want to do?

826
01:20:40,949 --> 01:20:49,029
I can't tell if everyone is trying to get tips, save,

827
01:20:49,029 --> 01:20:51,369
or if they're trying to turn the music off.

828
01:20:51,369 --> 01:21:07,539
Okay.

829
01:21:07,539 --> 01:21:25,850
Do you want to put it back on?

830
01:21:25,850 --> 01:21:27,159
Tips.

831
01:21:27,159 --> 01:21:27,560
Okay.

832
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:33,939
Tips are no longer on.

833
01:21:33,939 --> 01:21:34,500
All right.

834
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:34,979
It...

835
01:21:34,979 --> 01:21:35,609
Hold on.

836
01:21:35,609 --> 01:21:36,489
Wait, wait, wait.

837
01:21:36,489 --> 01:21:41,220
If you want the music to come back, click on the boomerang.

838
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:43,300
If you want me to put the tips back on,

839
01:21:43,689 --> 01:21:46,300
click up here.

840
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:58,390
Okay?

841
01:21:58,390 --> 01:22:00,229
Put on the doom OST.

842
01:22:00,229 --> 01:22:01,109
Oh, my God.

843
01:22:01,109 --> 01:22:01,909
Hold on.

844
01:22:01,909 --> 01:22:24,470
Okay.

845
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:26,520
Now what do you want me to do?

846
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:33,500
Time to go?

847
01:22:56,470 --> 01:22:57,029
What now?

848
01:22:57,029 --> 01:22:58,229
No, I'm not doing it louder.

849
01:23:05,899 --> 01:23:06,060
All right.

850
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:07,020
We're selecting the monkey.

851
01:23:08,229 --> 01:23:08,630
This one?

852
01:23:08,630 --> 01:23:09,350
I think it's this one.

853
01:23:09,989 --> 01:23:10,630
What would you like?

854
01:23:16,569 --> 01:23:23,899
Sharp.

855
01:23:23,899 --> 01:23:24,220
Okay.

856
01:23:26,489 --> 01:23:28,010
Three, two, one.

857
01:23:28,729 --> 01:23:29,050
Select.

858
01:23:31,670 --> 01:23:32,789
And the other one too, huh?

859
01:23:33,510 --> 01:23:46,090
Well, what did you do?

860
01:23:46,090 --> 01:23:47,449
What did you do last night, honey?

861
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:53,239
Oh, well, I had 4,000 people in a chat room.

862
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:54,439
All...

863
01:23:54,439 --> 01:24:00,149
We were playing a Balloons Tower Defense 5 that I wasn't playing it.

864
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:14,939
They were telling me what to do and I was blasting the doom soundtrack.

865
01:24:14,939 --> 01:24:16,859
Kind of split here on what people want to do.

866
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:19,859
Turn it up.

867
01:24:39,449 --> 01:24:40,819
Now what?

868
01:24:40,819 --> 01:24:41,380
Go again.

869
01:24:42,020 --> 01:24:42,260
No.

870
01:24:43,859 --> 01:24:45,300
You want to select this guy.

871
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:46,020
Now what do you want to do?

872
01:24:58,060 --> 01:24:59,420
My left ear.

873
01:25:01,899 --> 01:25:09,880
Is it loud in the left ear?

874
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:11,079
So we're buying this one.

875
01:25:13,539 --> 01:25:14,420
Thanks for playing, guys.

876
01:25:14,420 --> 01:25:14,899
Anything else?

877
01:25:19,859 --> 01:25:22,020
Again, this one too.

878
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:22,819
Both of them.

879
01:25:22,819 --> 01:25:23,539
Sonic Boom.

880
01:25:34,470 --> 01:25:36,390
Here's the wild thing about this stream.

881
01:25:37,109 --> 01:25:39,510
Remember the first like 10 minutes when we were doing this?

882
01:25:39,510 --> 01:25:41,989
I was like, oh, I don't know how to click this and then you vote.

883
01:25:41,989 --> 01:25:43,909
Look at how streamlined this has become.

884
01:25:43,909 --> 01:25:45,029
This is almost like scary.

885
01:25:45,029 --> 01:25:46,069
This is almost terrifying.

886
01:25:46,710 --> 01:26:00,979
Uh-oh.

887
01:26:06,579 --> 01:26:07,699
Ooh, that was close.

888
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:09,579
All right, hold on.

889
01:26:09,579 --> 01:26:10,619
I got to change the volumes here.

890
01:26:11,260 --> 01:26:12,409
Hold on.

891
01:26:12,409 --> 01:26:13,050
Wait.

892
01:26:13,050 --> 01:26:29,510
Now I have to stop for a second.

893
01:26:29,510 --> 01:26:31,479
I'm gonna turn this down.

894
01:26:34,329 --> 01:26:35,930
The chess game is done.

895
01:26:35,930 --> 01:26:36,569
Wait, what?

896
01:26:36,569 --> 01:26:38,329
Okay, I thought I just X'd out of the fucking window.

897
01:26:38,329 --> 01:26:40,729
I thought I just closed Balloon's Tower Defense 5.

898
01:26:40,729 --> 01:26:42,090
And there's no saving.

899
01:26:42,090 --> 01:26:44,010
Oh, that would have been so bad.

900
01:26:44,010 --> 01:26:45,960
I would have just gone.

901
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:49,539
I would have gone crying in the shower.

902
01:26:49,539 --> 01:26:50,100
Okay.

903
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:54,260
Uh, I need to put this in a different window so I can control how loud that is.

904
01:26:54,260 --> 01:26:59,029
So give me one second, guys.

905
01:27:05,350 --> 01:27:05,750
What?

906
01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:09,609
Why am I just loading up a random web page right now?

907
01:27:13,050 --> 01:27:14,170
What the fuck was that?

908
01:27:21,210 --> 01:27:22,010
Was that an ad?

909
01:27:28,710 --> 01:27:29,989
I have no idea what that was.

910
01:27:32,409 --> 01:27:36,600
I opened up another tab and it went to like...

911
01:27:37,319 --> 01:27:38,979
I don't have any fucking idea.

912
01:27:44,539 --> 01:27:45,420
This is correct, right?

913
01:27:49,689 --> 01:27:50,810
That was fucking weird.

914
01:27:51,609 --> 01:28:02,600
I can do that.

915
01:28:10,979 --> 01:28:13,619
And then that should be open now.

916
01:28:14,180 --> 01:28:17,060
I'm spending a lot of time trying to get this to work.

917
01:28:19,029 --> 01:28:19,670
There we go.

918
01:28:19,670 --> 01:28:20,069
Okay.

919
01:28:20,069 --> 01:28:24,789
So now drop this and then put this higher than that.

920
01:28:24,789 --> 01:28:25,670
Now that should be good.

921
01:28:25,670 --> 01:28:26,310
I'm ready to go.

922
01:28:36,729 --> 01:28:37,369
Okay.

923
01:28:37,369 --> 01:28:38,090
Here we go.

924
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:46,500
Tax.

925
01:28:53,609 --> 01:28:58,149
I think we're just going to go.

926
01:28:58,149 --> 01:28:59,270
I think we're just going to go.

927
01:29:00,069 --> 01:29:07,289
I think you're going to lose.

928
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:08,960
Oh!

929
01:29:11,479 --> 01:29:11,979
Oh!

930
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:17,819
Now what, guys?

931
01:29:18,619 --> 01:29:19,340
That's not good.

932
01:29:24,550 --> 01:29:25,050
50.

933
01:29:25,590 --> 01:29:30,630
All right.

934
01:29:30,630 --> 01:29:31,109
What do you want?

935
01:29:36,149 --> 01:29:36,710
Which one?

936
01:29:36,710 --> 01:29:37,750
Does it matter?

937
01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:39,350
Look at everybody panicking right now.

938
01:29:39,350 --> 01:29:40,069
People are panicking.

939
01:29:40,789 --> 01:29:41,750
I think we need tax.

940
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:42,949
Oh shit, let's close the game.

941
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:44,949
Get the ice monster.

942
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:54,310
Now what?

943
01:29:54,310 --> 01:30:03,220
Oh, I got to refresh it.

944
01:30:03,220 --> 01:30:08,890
I think people are panicking.

945
01:30:08,890 --> 01:30:09,930
This is 23.

946
01:30:10,010 --> 01:30:10,970
This is almost $2,400.

947
01:30:10,970 --> 01:30:11,850
Are you guys sure about this?

948
01:30:13,289 --> 01:30:14,329
Let me let the votes come through.

949
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:29,739
All right.

950
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:35,899
Anything else?

951
01:30:40,229 --> 01:30:40,869
Are you clicking up here?

952
01:30:42,149 --> 01:30:43,029
You guys want more health?

953
01:30:51,609 --> 01:30:52,109
Yes.

954
01:30:54,380 --> 01:30:54,939
All right.

955
01:30:54,939 --> 01:30:55,439
Okay.

956
01:31:04,390 --> 01:31:05,109
You can't do that.

957
01:31:05,109 --> 01:31:05,609
Something else.

958
01:31:13,770 --> 01:31:14,329
All right.

959
01:31:14,329 --> 01:31:24,119
It looks like you're selecting the buccaneer.

960
01:31:24,119 --> 01:31:26,420
Faster shooting.

961
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:27,220
You got it.

962
01:31:27,220 --> 01:31:30,489
Come on, guys.

963
01:31:30,489 --> 01:31:30,890
You can't.

964
01:31:30,890 --> 01:31:31,449
We got it.

965
01:31:31,449 --> 01:31:32,329
Come on.

966
01:31:32,329 --> 01:31:34,180
We've got to beat this.

967
01:31:34,180 --> 01:31:39,689
Is this tax or go?

968
01:31:40,329 --> 01:31:41,449
This looks like tax to me.

969
01:31:42,010 --> 01:31:46,710
All right.

970
01:31:46,710 --> 01:31:50,199
Where are they going?

971
01:31:50,199 --> 01:31:51,479
Where are the tax going?

972
01:31:51,479 --> 01:31:54,489
At the end, we did three last time.

973
01:31:54,489 --> 01:31:54,729
Okay.

974
01:31:54,729 --> 01:31:55,609
We'll do one, two.

975
01:31:55,609 --> 01:31:56,010
How many?

976
01:31:56,010 --> 01:31:56,810
Let's make sure we get.

977
01:31:56,810 --> 01:31:57,210
Hold on.

978
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:01,479
One, two, three.

979
01:32:02,039 --> 01:32:03,000
That's what we did last time.

980
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:06,760
If you want more than three,

981
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:08,039
you got to click on that spot again.

982
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:09,159
You ready?

983
01:32:13,239 --> 01:32:14,039
Oh, damn.

984
01:32:14,039 --> 01:32:14,439
More.

985
01:32:14,439 --> 01:32:14,840
Another.

986
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:15,079
Okay.

987
01:32:15,079 --> 01:32:16,039
Here's one, two.

988
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:18,119
I did two more.

989
01:32:21,909 --> 01:32:22,310
More.

990
01:32:22,310 --> 01:32:23,510
You guys want more tax?

991
01:32:24,310 --> 01:32:33,779
All right.

992
01:32:33,779 --> 01:32:34,420
I'm closing it.

993
01:32:34,979 --> 01:32:38,409
Do you want more tax?

994
01:32:44,250 --> 01:32:44,890
All right.

995
01:32:44,890 --> 01:32:45,130
Okay.

996
01:32:45,130 --> 01:32:45,850
That's enough.

997
01:32:45,850 --> 01:32:46,329
Apparently.

998
01:32:52,220 --> 01:32:52,460
All right.

999
01:32:52,460 --> 01:32:53,100
Let's go.

1000
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:53,579
Are you ready?

1001
01:32:54,140 --> 01:32:56,739
Hold on to your asses.

1002
01:32:56,739 --> 01:33:02,899
Here it comes.

1003
01:33:10,250 --> 01:33:10,489
What?

1004
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:18,579
No.

1005
01:33:19,779 --> 01:33:20,340
I think we're good.

1006
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:28,729
I think we're safe.

1007
01:33:29,619 --> 01:33:30,500
Uh-oh.

1008
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:37,239
You did it.

1009
01:33:38,310 --> 01:33:40,340
You guys did it.

1010
01:33:40,340 --> 01:33:41,460
You actually did it.

1011
01:33:42,699 --> 01:33:43,659
We're halfway through.

1012
01:33:45,460 --> 01:33:45,859
Let's go.

1013
01:33:46,579 --> 01:33:55,420
You want this one?

1014
01:34:01,859 --> 01:34:02,420
Which one is it?

1015
01:34:02,420 --> 01:34:03,619
I'm going to have to zoom in for this.

1016
01:34:04,340 --> 01:34:10,279
Okay.

1017
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:11,720
Got them selected.

1018
01:34:17,289 --> 01:34:18,250
Enhance eyesight.

1019
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:19,050
Increase attack range.

1020
01:34:19,050 --> 01:34:24,970
Even further allows dart monkey to shoot camo balloons.

1021
01:34:24,970 --> 01:34:25,529
Sounds good.

1022
01:34:26,250 --> 01:34:26,810
What's next?

1023
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:36,739
More upgrades on this guy.

1024
01:34:36,739 --> 01:34:51,689
You want the spike-a-pult.

1025
01:34:51,689 --> 01:34:56,409
All right.

1026
01:34:56,409 --> 01:34:58,420
Three, two, one.

1027
01:34:58,420 --> 01:34:59,300
Refreshing.

1028
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:00,260
Here we go again.

1029
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:07,319
I'm going to let this one play for a second because

1030
01:35:07,319 --> 01:35:11,800
it looks like there's some uncertainty amongst us.

1031
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:29,380
Everybody's panicking.

1032
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:31,579
This is the one.

1033
01:35:31,579 --> 01:35:33,500
There's 4,500 votes here.

1034
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:34,789
How is that possible?

1035
01:35:34,789 --> 01:35:35,909
There's more votes than people.

1036
01:35:35,909 --> 01:35:36,149
What?

1037
01:35:36,710 --> 01:35:37,829
All right.

1038
01:35:37,829 --> 01:35:38,390
I'm going to-

1039
01:35:38,390 --> 01:35:38,550
Hold on.

1040
01:35:38,550 --> 01:35:39,350
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1041
01:35:41,750 --> 01:35:42,069
Again.

1042
01:36:02,279 --> 01:36:02,600
Okay.

1043
01:36:03,539 --> 01:36:04,579
That's what the people want.

1044
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:11,239
Again.

1045
01:36:11,239 --> 01:36:19,739
This is split here between buying this and putting it on last.

1046
01:36:26,380 --> 01:36:26,779
All right.

1047
01:36:26,779 --> 01:36:29,479
Last.

1048
01:36:29,479 --> 01:36:35,689
Now what?

1049
01:36:35,689 --> 01:36:36,569
This again.

1050
01:36:36,569 --> 01:36:37,130
Buy it again.

1051
01:36:38,010 --> 01:36:38,489
All right.

1052
01:36:38,489 --> 01:36:40,890
This is on Razor Sharp.

1053
01:36:42,979 --> 01:36:44,500
You guys have the confidence to win, do you think?

1054
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:50,840
No, you want more?

1055
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:51,159
Okay.

1056
01:36:51,960 --> 01:37:00,569
Take a look and see where you want it.

1057
01:37:08,020 --> 01:37:08,899
Oh, fuck.

1058
01:37:08,899 --> 01:37:09,460
Look at this.

1059
01:37:12,899 --> 01:37:15,460
There are some arguments going to be happening right now

1060
01:37:15,460 --> 01:37:21,989
between the ace and a cannon.

1061
01:37:21,989 --> 01:37:25,380
Looks like it's going to be an ace.

1062
01:37:25,939 --> 01:37:35,539
Let's go.

1063
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:37,350
Where's it going?

1064
01:37:49,510 --> 01:37:51,109
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1065
01:37:51,109 --> 01:37:51,829
Look at this.

1066
01:37:51,829 --> 01:37:52,390
Cancel.

1067
01:37:53,109 --> 01:37:58,500
Cancel.

1068
01:37:59,220 --> 01:37:59,779
Cancel.

1069
01:38:02,810 --> 01:38:04,170
You guys really are panicking.

1070
01:38:05,050 --> 01:38:05,369
Okay.

1071
01:38:06,170 --> 01:38:06,409
All right.

1072
01:38:06,409 --> 01:38:07,210
I have to cancel.

1073
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:08,859
Cancel.

1074
01:38:09,579 --> 01:38:17,430
All right.

1075
01:38:17,430 --> 01:38:19,029
What do you want in place of it?

1076
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:31,430
I'm scared.

1077
01:38:36,359 --> 01:38:36,760
Flank out.

1078
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:39,399
I'm going to refresh it one more time just to make sure chat gets this right

1079
01:38:39,399 --> 01:38:41,800
because we're at the point where if you make a mistake, it's over.

1080
01:38:54,069 --> 01:38:55,109
Can it is?

1081
01:38:55,109 --> 01:39:00,439
Let's hope you get good placement.

1082
01:39:10,180 --> 01:39:10,899
Oh dear.

1083
01:39:10,899 --> 01:39:12,420
We have to enhance this one.

1084
01:39:12,420 --> 01:39:13,699
How am I even going to get it over there?

1085
01:39:16,180 --> 01:39:17,220
It doesn't fit over here.

1086
01:39:23,430 --> 01:39:30,300
Guys, it can't go over here.

1087
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:35,539
It has to go on land.

1088
01:39:35,539 --> 01:39:36,979
I can't squeeze it anywhere.

1089
01:39:36,979 --> 01:39:39,770
Refresh it.

1090
01:39:46,220 --> 01:39:47,899
This is an enhanced scenario, I think.

1091
01:39:47,899 --> 01:39:48,460
Yeah, it is.

1092
01:39:49,699 --> 01:39:50,500
Refresh it again.

1093
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:53,670
Enhance.

1094
01:39:53,670 --> 01:39:55,800
Ready?

1095
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:56,680
Be certain about this.

1096
01:40:08,199 --> 01:40:11,319
Looks like you want it right up there on Earth.

1097
01:40:11,319 --> 01:40:14,409
Kind of right in the middle of those clouds.

1098
01:40:14,970 --> 01:40:18,170
Okay.

1099
01:40:18,170 --> 01:40:26,119
Pull it back right here.

1100
01:40:39,159 --> 01:40:41,640
Now we see the fight between what upgrades to do.

1101
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:47,000
How much money?

1102
01:40:47,720 --> 01:40:49,899
535 bucks.

1103
01:40:49,899 --> 01:40:50,939
We can only do one of these.

1104
01:40:59,539 --> 01:41:00,260
Holy shit.

1105
01:41:01,779 --> 01:41:07,060
I'm going to refresh it again because a lot of people clicked up there still.

1106
01:41:07,060 --> 01:41:07,300
All right.

1107
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:07,539
Ready?

1108
01:41:09,430 --> 01:41:11,750
Three, two, one.

1109
01:41:11,750 --> 01:41:12,229
Go for it.

1110
01:41:22,420 --> 01:41:23,460
Everyone's freaking out.

1111
01:41:39,100 --> 01:41:39,500
All right.

1112
01:41:40,140 --> 01:41:40,699
Let's do it.

1113
01:41:41,340 --> 01:41:45,529
Is it time for the round to begin?

1114
01:41:46,090 --> 01:41:50,069
Oh boy.

1115
01:41:50,710 --> 01:41:54,739
All right, guys.

1116
01:41:54,739 --> 01:41:55,220
It's time.

1117
01:41:55,939 --> 01:41:59,770
Good luck.

1118
01:41:59,770 --> 01:42:28,760
Ceramic balloons are made out of clay and they take 10 hits to destroy.

1119
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:29,399
There you go.

1120
01:42:29,399 --> 01:42:29,960
41.

1121
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:33,609
You did it.

1122
01:42:33,609 --> 01:42:34,729
That was really easy.

1123
01:42:42,060 --> 01:42:45,739
Enhance this because I don't know what the hell this is.

1124
01:42:45,739 --> 01:42:48,939
This is where the glue guy is right below that.

1125
01:42:48,939 --> 01:42:50,779
So click where you need to click.

1126
01:42:58,140 --> 01:42:59,819
Do I need to double enhancement?

1127
01:42:59,819 --> 01:43:03,260
Holy shit.

1128
01:43:05,300 --> 01:43:06,180
I'm going to refresh it again.

1129
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:09,140
If you want the glue, you got to click a little bit further down.

1130
01:43:09,140 --> 01:43:11,619
You got to click almost near the bottom of that page.

1131
01:43:12,180 --> 01:43:14,199
Click on the cannon if you want the cannon.

1132
01:43:14,199 --> 01:43:15,510
You ready?

1133
01:43:15,510 --> 01:43:33,050
What the fuck is happening?

1134
01:43:33,050 --> 01:43:35,369
Chat is playing Bloons Tower Defense 5.

1135
01:43:36,010 --> 01:43:40,300
They've made it to nearly just about the halfway point and it's on hard.

1136
01:43:43,060 --> 01:43:43,380
All right.

1137
01:43:43,380 --> 01:43:44,260
Looks like it's going to be glue.

1138
01:43:51,189 --> 01:43:51,510
Okay.

1139
01:43:52,149 --> 01:43:53,189
What would you have me do with this?

1140
01:44:00,970 --> 01:44:01,850
Stickier glue.

1141
01:44:02,939 --> 01:44:03,260
Okay.

1142
01:44:04,220 --> 01:44:07,960
I don't know if there's any more money to do anything else.

1143
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:08,680
900 bucks.

1144
01:44:17,239 --> 01:44:18,359
Now and the cannon.

1145
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:21,319
All right.

1146
01:44:21,319 --> 01:44:22,199
Cannon is selected.

1147
01:44:30,010 --> 01:44:31,050
Frag bombs.

1148
01:44:33,060 --> 01:44:33,380
Okay.

1149
01:44:42,869 --> 01:44:44,149
That is 600.

1150
01:44:44,149 --> 01:44:45,270
There's another 100 bucks, I think.

1151
01:44:45,270 --> 01:44:46,229
Couple hundred bucks.

1152
01:44:46,229 --> 01:44:50,579
Now the cannon.

1153
01:44:51,300 --> 01:45:10,600
Same thing to the other cannon it looks like, right?

1154
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:11,399
Okay.

1155
01:45:11,399 --> 01:45:14,710
Is that all you'd like to do?

1156
01:45:19,300 --> 01:45:19,699
Strong.

1157
01:45:20,340 --> 01:45:21,960
So I'm going to...

1158
01:45:21,960 --> 01:45:22,279
Okay.

1159
01:45:22,279 --> 01:45:23,159
This is 50-50.

1160
01:45:23,159 --> 01:45:24,600
We're going to do this again and we're going to do strong.

1161
01:45:38,090 --> 01:45:38,409
All right.

1162
01:45:38,409 --> 01:45:39,210
I'll go.

1163
01:45:39,210 --> 01:45:48,550
Do we need tacks too?

1164
01:45:48,550 --> 01:45:49,989
Are you sure about that?

1165
01:45:49,989 --> 01:45:51,529
Hold on.

1166
01:45:51,529 --> 01:45:54,819
I'm going to refresh.

1167
01:45:54,819 --> 01:45:57,899
Okay.

1168
01:45:57,899 --> 01:46:00,060
I'm seeing a lot less people clicking on that.

1169
01:46:00,060 --> 01:46:08,630
It's definitely down here.

1170
01:46:08,630 --> 01:46:09,510
I don't know.

1171
01:46:09,510 --> 01:46:12,229
That's evening out.

1172
01:46:21,050 --> 01:46:21,930
I'm going to refresh it again.

1173
01:46:21,930 --> 01:46:27,989
If you want tacks, please click over here if you want tacks.

1174
01:46:27,989 --> 01:46:29,500
Go can stay over here.

1175
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:42,039
Ready?

1176
01:46:42,039 --> 01:46:44,520
Not as extreme as I thought it was going to be.

1177
01:46:49,300 --> 01:46:49,939
Okay.

1178
01:46:49,939 --> 01:46:52,039
Good luck.

1179
01:46:52,039 --> 01:47:13,109
I guess it's doing pretty well.

1180
01:47:19,750 --> 01:47:21,270
Nothing's even getting remotely by.

1181
01:47:29,340 --> 01:47:31,659
The cannons are syncing with the song.

1182
01:47:31,659 --> 01:47:32,779
Are they really?

1183
01:47:32,779 --> 01:47:47,260
Pretty stellar job.

1184
01:47:47,260 --> 01:47:51,770
I'm not going to lie.

1185
01:47:51,770 --> 01:48:01,130
Super monkey.

1186
01:48:01,130 --> 01:48:02,090
More towers.

1187
01:48:02,090 --> 01:48:07,220
More towers.

1188
01:48:07,220 --> 01:48:08,020
All right.

1189
01:48:08,020 --> 01:48:11,340
More towers.

1190
01:48:11,340 --> 01:48:12,060
Oops.

1191
01:48:12,060 --> 01:48:15,079
It's this one.

1192
01:48:15,079 --> 01:48:19,590
Make your selection.

1193
01:48:19,590 --> 01:48:20,229
Which one?

1194
01:48:20,229 --> 01:48:28,489
I can't afford the super monkey.

1195
01:48:28,489 --> 01:48:30,869
He's too much money.

1196
01:48:30,869 --> 01:48:31,989
He's $37.80.

1197
01:48:31,989 --> 01:48:42,090
We have $22.79.

1198
01:48:42,090 --> 01:48:42,569
Yeah, guys.

1199
01:48:44,939 --> 01:48:49,659
That's not going to happen.

1200
01:48:49,659 --> 01:48:59,060
I'm going to have to pull this back and see what else your other options are here.

1201
01:48:59,060 --> 01:49:01,539
Just go, go, go, go, go, go.

1202
01:49:03,380 --> 01:49:03,859
All right.

1203
01:49:04,420 --> 01:49:10,579
I hope that wasn't a mistake.

1204
01:49:11,140 --> 01:49:30,010
Uh-oh.

1205
01:49:30,010 --> 01:49:32,699
Are they going to make it around?

1206
01:49:32,699 --> 01:49:36,859
Oh, you guys are golden.

1207
01:49:37,500 --> 01:49:39,939
Fucking air level up.

1208
01:49:45,510 --> 01:49:45,909
Save.

1209
01:49:45,909 --> 01:49:47,270
I can't save the game.

1210
01:49:47,270 --> 01:49:49,659
I need to make like an account.

1211
01:49:49,659 --> 01:49:50,779
This is one and done, guys.

1212
01:49:51,739 --> 01:49:52,939
If you lose, it's over.

1213
01:49:52,939 --> 01:49:57,140
All right.

1214
01:49:57,140 --> 01:50:03,189
Buck an air.

1215
01:50:03,189 --> 01:50:07,289
Now what?

1216
01:50:07,289 --> 01:50:19,510
Grape shot.

1217
01:50:19,510 --> 01:50:20,149
Okay.

1218
01:50:20,149 --> 01:50:23,989
$2400.

1219
01:50:26,630 --> 01:50:27,510
What else is your plan?

1220
01:50:31,319 --> 01:50:33,079
I'm going to have to enhance with this one.

1221
01:50:33,079 --> 01:50:35,159
Or is it just...

1222
01:50:35,159 --> 01:50:35,720
Okay.

1223
01:50:35,720 --> 01:50:38,810
Do you want this one or this one?

1224
01:50:38,810 --> 01:50:39,930
That's the thing here.

1225
01:50:39,930 --> 01:50:41,050
How much money is it?

1226
01:50:41,050 --> 01:50:46,970
I got to enhance on this one.

1227
01:50:46,970 --> 01:50:48,010
Oh, fuck.

1228
01:50:48,010 --> 01:50:49,369
I got to take a new picture.

1229
01:50:49,369 --> 01:50:52,260
Hold on.

1230
01:50:52,260 --> 01:51:10,300
Hold on to your seats for a second.

1231
01:51:10,300 --> 01:51:10,619
Right.

1232
01:51:14,819 --> 01:51:32,279
New picture incoming.

1233
01:51:32,279 --> 01:51:32,920
All right.

1234
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:43,100
There we go.

1235
01:51:43,100 --> 01:51:43,659
Which one?

1236
01:51:56,359 --> 01:51:57,000
Top one's winning.

1237
01:52:01,479 --> 01:52:04,310
It looks like it could be done with both.

1238
01:52:04,310 --> 01:52:05,829
Bottom one's winning first so far.

1239
01:52:05,829 --> 01:52:14,659
So that one is selected.

1240
01:52:14,659 --> 01:52:15,220
Pretty close.

1241
01:52:15,220 --> 01:52:26,260
But which one?

1242
01:52:26,260 --> 01:52:28,119
Doesn't even seem like a contest.

1243
01:52:28,119 --> 01:52:28,840
Night vision goggles.

1244
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:31,479
Allow snipers to detect and shoot camo balloons.

1245
01:52:31,479 --> 01:52:35,829
All right.

1246
01:52:45,350 --> 01:52:46,949
Looks like people want to do that again.

1247
01:52:51,140 --> 01:52:52,500
Same thing on the other one, I think,

1248
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:54,500
is what the consensus will be.

1249
01:52:54,500 --> 01:52:58,170
And it is.

1250
01:52:58,729 --> 01:53:04,380
They can see the camouflage balloons now.

1251
01:53:05,020 --> 01:53:09,079
$1700.

1252
01:53:09,079 --> 01:53:15,399
I think that's it.

1253
01:53:19,659 --> 01:53:20,060
Good luck.

1254
01:53:33,720 --> 01:53:34,760
Yeah, it's on hard.

1255
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,699
This is on hard right now.

1256
01:53:37,699 --> 01:53:38,500
It's not on easy.

1257
01:53:39,380 --> 01:53:41,779
So a couple of mistakes could end the whole thing.

1258
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:47,699
All right.

1259
01:53:47,699 --> 01:53:48,180
What now?

1260
01:53:54,649 --> 01:53:55,050
Again?

1261
01:53:57,319 --> 01:53:58,119
Again, it seems.

1262
01:54:04,970 --> 01:54:05,609
All right.

1263
01:54:05,609 --> 01:54:06,729
Holy shit.

1264
01:54:06,729 --> 01:54:09,739
I'm not fucking around here on this one.

1265
01:54:10,380 --> 01:54:18,710
What round is this?

1266
01:54:19,270 --> 01:54:22,920
It's getting up there.

1267
01:54:30,899 --> 01:54:32,699
Bomb tower.

1268
01:54:32,699 --> 01:54:34,539
Unlocked access to the missile launcher.

1269
01:54:37,130 --> 01:54:37,529
What now?

1270
01:54:39,939 --> 01:54:40,439
Ooh.

1271
01:54:41,609 --> 01:54:42,729
Get the super monkey!

1272
01:54:42,729 --> 01:54:45,819
Get the super monkey!

1273
01:54:45,819 --> 01:54:47,579
I don't even need to pull the thing up.

1274
01:54:47,579 --> 01:54:47,979
Look at this.

1275
01:54:47,979 --> 01:54:48,539
It's so perfect.

1276
01:54:48,539 --> 01:54:49,659
You guys are all over here.

1277
01:54:51,510 --> 01:54:52,949
Now here's the really important thing.

1278
01:54:52,949 --> 01:54:55,850
I'm going to put the image on the screen.

1279
01:54:55,850 --> 01:54:56,170
Where?

1280
01:55:08,819 --> 01:55:09,460
Look at that.

1281
01:55:11,029 --> 01:55:14,649
And not one person thought otherwise.

1282
01:55:14,649 --> 01:55:20,260
That is 100%.

1283
01:55:20,260 --> 01:55:22,260
Look at you guys working together.

1284
01:55:22,260 --> 01:55:22,739
It's great.

1285
01:55:22,739 --> 01:55:23,300
I love it.

1286
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:27,369
So right in the middle there.

1287
01:55:27,369 --> 01:55:28,890
Right kind of on the edge.

1288
01:55:30,979 --> 01:55:32,180
I see what you're doing here.

1289
01:55:32,180 --> 01:55:34,250
All right.

1290
01:55:34,250 --> 01:55:41,850
And there he is.

1291
01:55:41,850 --> 01:55:52,149
Now what?

1292
01:55:52,149 --> 01:55:53,029
$584.

1293
01:55:53,029 --> 01:55:53,829
Looks like we're just going to go.

1294
01:55:54,390 --> 01:56:02,949
Looks like we're just going to go.

1295
01:56:06,260 --> 01:56:07,060
Yes.

1296
01:56:07,060 --> 01:56:08,739
Shit load of boats coming in here.

1297
01:56:08,739 --> 01:56:09,140
Let's go.

1298
01:56:09,859 --> 01:56:16,170
Now the super monkey goes 100 miles per hour.

1299
01:56:23,420 --> 01:56:23,899
Damn.

1300
01:56:28,810 --> 01:56:30,170
45 of 85.

1301
01:56:31,939 --> 01:56:34,420
40 more rounds to go to beat the whole thing.

1302
01:56:34,979 --> 01:56:42,859
I don't think anything's getting by this for a while.

1303
01:56:43,420 --> 01:56:50,359
Somebody said I've never seen a super monkey before.

1304
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:54,409
You guys are playing really actually very well.

1305
01:56:57,939 --> 01:56:58,659
Long round.

1306
01:56:58,659 --> 01:56:58,899
All right.

1307
01:56:58,899 --> 01:56:59,859
Glue gunner level up.

1308
01:56:59,859 --> 01:57:00,739
Corrosive glue.

1309
01:57:03,350 --> 01:57:05,529
Monkey apprentice unlocked.

1310
01:57:06,170 --> 01:57:07,689
That's all towers are unlocked.

1311
01:57:07,689 --> 01:57:08,090
Oh no.

1312
01:57:08,090 --> 01:57:08,890
That's not even true.

1313
01:57:12,779 --> 01:57:18,310
All right.

1314
01:57:18,310 --> 01:57:20,229
We have $3,000 to spend.

1315
01:57:23,829 --> 01:57:24,310
Enhance.

1316
01:57:27,300 --> 01:57:28,020
Go again please.

1317
01:57:28,020 --> 01:57:37,779
Thank you.

1318
01:57:37,779 --> 01:57:44,250
Seems to be the cannon.

1319
01:57:44,250 --> 01:57:45,850
Because super monkey is down there,

1320
01:57:45,850 --> 01:57:47,689
but cannon is over here.

1321
01:57:47,689 --> 01:57:53,020
Although I can't.

1322
01:57:53,020 --> 01:57:53,340
Yeah.

1323
01:57:53,340 --> 01:57:54,619
49, 23.

1324
01:57:54,619 --> 01:57:57,399
Cannon it is.

1325
01:57:57,399 --> 01:58:05,960
All right.

1326
01:58:05,960 --> 01:58:10,840
There's really only one thing to do with the cannon.

1327
01:58:10,840 --> 01:58:12,199
And that's missile launcher.

1328
01:58:12,199 --> 01:58:16,939
Which is what you guys are clicking on.

1329
01:58:16,939 --> 01:58:25,029
Missile launcher complete.

1330
01:58:25,029 --> 01:58:31,079
I'm just the RTS narrator in a video game.

1331
01:58:31,079 --> 01:58:33,239
Construction complete.

1332
01:58:33,239 --> 01:58:34,039
Selecting.

1333
01:58:34,039 --> 01:58:40,819
Super monkey upgrade.

1334
01:58:40,819 --> 01:58:41,939
Building constructed.

1335
01:58:48,090 --> 01:58:49,609
This is pretty split here.

1336
01:58:49,609 --> 01:58:51,449
2,600.

1337
01:58:51,449 --> 01:58:57,590
Another cannon.

1338
01:58:57,590 --> 01:58:58,470
I guess so.

1339
01:58:58,470 --> 01:59:00,569
Yeah.

1340
01:59:00,569 --> 01:59:01,369
52%.

1341
01:59:01,369 --> 01:59:09,689
I think we're doing it again.

1342
01:59:09,689 --> 01:59:10,329
Yeah.

1343
01:59:10,329 --> 01:59:14,630
Two missile launchers ready to go.

1344
01:59:14,630 --> 01:59:15,430
Locked and loaded.

1345
01:59:28,680 --> 01:59:29,880
Is this an enhanced scenario?

1346
01:59:34,539 --> 01:59:35,020
It can't be.

1347
01:59:35,020 --> 01:59:35,979
It has to be this.

1348
01:59:35,979 --> 01:59:37,340
Because there's no...

1349
01:59:37,340 --> 01:59:38,300
Nothing can be upgraded here.

1350
01:59:38,300 --> 01:59:41,899
So it has to be this one.

1351
01:59:41,899 --> 01:59:43,979
Put on the red alert OST.

1352
01:59:43,979 --> 01:59:49,899
All right.

1353
01:59:49,899 --> 01:59:51,180
I'll put on red alert.

1354
01:59:51,180 --> 01:59:51,979
OST.

1355
01:59:51,979 --> 02:00:00,460
Red alert.

1356
02:00:12,890 --> 02:00:13,449
Sniper.

1357
02:00:15,420 --> 02:00:15,899
Sour.

1358
02:00:17,020 --> 02:00:17,180
What?

1359
02:00:17,420 --> 02:00:24,439
How do you pronounce that?

1360
02:00:24,439 --> 02:00:25,319
How am I...

1361
02:00:25,319 --> 02:00:26,279
Is it sour please?

1362
02:00:26,840 --> 02:00:30,359
How are we still playing this?

1363
02:00:30,359 --> 02:00:35,909
Because you guys haven't lost.

1364
02:00:35,909 --> 02:00:36,310
Louder.

1365
02:00:36,310 --> 02:00:37,109
Louder.

1366
02:00:37,109 --> 02:00:40,539
All right.

1367
02:00:40,539 --> 02:00:40,939
You ready?

1368
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:57,979
Is that all we can do?

1369
02:00:57,979 --> 02:00:59,100
Seems we're pretty conflicted.

1370
02:01:00,569 --> 02:01:02,970
50% want to buy something else.

1371
02:01:02,970 --> 02:01:16,600
All right.

1372
02:01:16,600 --> 02:01:21,210
I think I know what you guys are going to pick here.

1373
02:01:21,930 --> 02:01:27,399
A wizard.

1374
02:01:28,039 --> 02:01:38,680
All right.

1375
02:01:38,680 --> 02:01:39,319
Wizard it is.

1376
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:47,850
But where does it go?

1377
02:01:50,550 --> 02:01:51,829
Please let me know.

1378
02:01:51,829 --> 02:01:52,789
Where you'd like to put it.

1379
02:02:01,350 --> 02:02:02,390
Looks like right...

1380
02:02:03,500 --> 02:02:06,619
Right behind the glue gunner.

1381
02:02:09,449 --> 02:02:10,090
Zoom it out.

1382
02:02:10,810 --> 02:02:15,260
You want it right behind the glue gunner

1383
02:02:15,260 --> 02:02:15,979
or do you want it somewhere else?

1384
02:02:15,979 --> 02:02:16,859
Here we go.

1385
02:02:16,859 --> 02:02:18,300
If you want it right behind the glue gunner there

1386
02:02:18,300 --> 02:02:19,819
then keep it there.

1387
02:02:30,680 --> 02:02:32,199
Looks like you want it right there.

1388
02:02:32,199 --> 02:02:32,920
Like right here.

1389
02:02:35,180 --> 02:02:37,500
The thing is here or here.

1390
02:02:43,100 --> 02:02:43,500
What's with...

1391
02:02:43,500 --> 02:02:44,220
Why down here?

1392
02:02:50,010 --> 02:02:50,569
Lower.

1393
02:02:50,569 --> 02:02:51,050
Lower.

1394
02:02:51,050 --> 02:02:51,369
Lower.

1395
02:02:51,369 --> 02:02:51,609
All right.

1396
02:02:51,609 --> 02:02:52,010
Hold on.

1397
02:02:53,560 --> 02:02:54,439
Let's be more...

1398
02:02:54,439 --> 02:02:56,359
Can we be more precise on it from here?

1399
02:03:03,699 --> 02:03:04,659
Even lower than that.

1400
02:03:04,659 --> 02:03:05,300
Like down there.

1401
02:03:05,859 --> 02:03:07,689
Move the image up.

1402
02:03:08,329 --> 02:03:12,779
So you guys want it here.

1403
02:03:13,420 --> 02:03:15,720
Like right there.

1404
02:03:26,199 --> 02:03:26,520
All right.

1405
02:03:26,520 --> 02:03:26,920
Here we go.

1406
02:03:30,170 --> 02:03:30,569
Sure.

1407
02:03:30,569 --> 02:03:31,050
Why not?

1408
02:03:31,689 --> 02:03:33,529
All right.

1409
02:03:33,529 --> 02:03:37,529
I can't take the red alert OST anymore.

1410
02:03:37,529 --> 02:03:39,210
We need something calming.

1411
02:03:39,210 --> 02:03:47,939
How about...

1412
02:03:47,939 --> 02:03:51,539
How about 11 hours of ocean sounds?

1413
02:03:51,539 --> 02:04:04,500
All right.

1414
02:04:04,500 --> 02:04:05,140
That sounds good.

1415
02:04:12,279 --> 02:04:12,680
All right.

1416
02:04:12,680 --> 02:04:13,079
Now what?

1417
02:04:23,130 --> 02:04:25,130
Vessel stop.

1418
02:04:25,130 --> 02:04:26,409
Vessel stop.

1419
02:04:26,409 --> 02:04:28,810
All right.

1420
02:04:28,810 --> 02:04:30,869
Let's go.

1421
02:04:30,869 --> 02:04:34,630
Moab class balloons like Moabs and even larger

1422
02:04:34,630 --> 02:04:36,149
require hundreds of hits to pop.

1423
02:04:36,149 --> 02:04:38,390
Luckily for you, they tend to move more quickly.

1424
02:04:38,390 --> 02:04:39,350
So this is a Moab round.

1425
02:04:39,989 --> 02:04:45,369
They gonna get it?

1426
02:04:50,659 --> 02:04:51,619
Not even a problem.

1427
02:04:52,340 --> 02:04:53,619
Everyone was so concerned about that.

1428
02:04:53,619 --> 02:04:55,140
That was not even remotely an issue.

1429
02:04:55,859 --> 02:04:58,659
Destroyed.

1430
02:04:58,659 --> 02:05:00,659
Super Monkey has now laser blast eyes.

1431
02:05:04,949 --> 02:05:05,189
What?

1432
02:05:05,189 --> 02:05:05,670
What do you want?

1433
02:05:08,789 --> 02:05:09,590
Super Monkey.

1434
02:05:10,970 --> 02:05:12,090
Nah, there's not enough money.

1435
02:05:22,359 --> 02:05:23,479
Not enough money.

1436
02:05:23,479 --> 02:05:27,380
Gonna have to pick something else.

1437
02:05:31,960 --> 02:05:32,600
Go again.

1438
02:05:32,600 --> 02:05:32,840
Okay.

1439
02:05:43,140 --> 02:05:43,699
Oh boy.

1440
02:05:50,340 --> 02:05:52,340
No, it's still under control somewhat.

1441
02:05:52,340 --> 02:06:07,590
It's still somewhat under control.

1442
02:06:07,590 --> 02:06:09,699
Okay.

1443
02:06:10,659 --> 02:06:11,460
Is there enough money?

1444
02:06:11,460 --> 02:06:14,039
Now everyone's like, all right, I'll do it.

1445
02:06:14,039 --> 02:06:14,680
Uh-oh.

1446
02:06:14,680 --> 02:06:16,890
Split decision.

1447
02:06:16,890 --> 02:06:23,350
There are a lot of people that want to save money.

1448
02:06:23,350 --> 02:06:25,960
There's also a lot of people that want to upgrade

1449
02:06:25,960 --> 02:06:27,529
the Super Monkey right now.

1450
02:06:35,909 --> 02:06:43,619
You still can't do it.

1451
02:06:43,619 --> 02:06:45,140
Super Monkey cannot be selected.

1452
02:06:45,140 --> 02:06:46,180
It can't be upgraded.

1453
02:06:46,180 --> 02:06:49,800
Would you like to try again?

1454
02:06:49,800 --> 02:07:06,840
Well, you found a new Monkey.

1455
02:07:06,840 --> 02:07:08,199
Buy it during the round?

1456
02:07:08,199 --> 02:07:08,840
Well, all right.

1457
02:07:08,840 --> 02:07:09,640
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

1458
02:07:09,640 --> 02:07:11,340
Okay.

1459
02:07:11,340 --> 02:07:13,979
If you want me to buy the...

1460
02:07:13,979 --> 02:07:14,380
Which one?

1461
02:07:14,380 --> 02:07:14,779
This one?

1462
02:07:14,779 --> 02:07:18,170
If you want me to buy this during the round,

1463
02:07:18,170 --> 02:07:19,130
click up here.

1464
02:07:19,130 --> 02:07:20,779
Do it up here.

1465
02:07:20,779 --> 02:07:22,699
If you do not want me to do that,

1466
02:07:24,329 --> 02:07:29,079
then pick a different thing.

1467
02:07:29,079 --> 02:07:32,100
You ready?

1468
02:07:32,100 --> 02:07:33,539
So click up here if you want me to do it

1469
02:07:33,539 --> 02:07:40,329
in the middle of the round or something else.

1470
02:07:40,329 --> 02:07:40,729
Damn.

1471
02:07:44,600 --> 02:07:45,239
All righty then.

1472
02:07:49,260 --> 02:07:49,819
All right.

1473
02:07:49,819 --> 02:07:52,060
Middle of the round we go.

1474
02:07:52,060 --> 02:08:03,829
Would you like for me to proceed?

1475
02:08:03,829 --> 02:08:04,949
Just was making sure.

1476
02:08:04,949 --> 02:08:12,760
Let's go.

1477
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:13,560
Need 37.

1478
02:08:17,180 --> 02:08:17,979
Strong, strong.

1479
02:08:17,979 --> 02:08:18,460
I'm sorry.

1480
02:08:18,460 --> 02:08:21,260
That was not selected.

1481
02:08:21,260 --> 02:08:22,699
That wasn't the highest percentage.

1482
02:08:22,699 --> 02:08:32,859
That's the one I clicked.

1483
02:08:32,859 --> 02:08:33,659
All right.

1484
02:08:33,659 --> 02:08:34,220
Laser eyes.

1485
02:08:44,359 --> 02:08:45,479
I think you guys are going to beat it.

1486
02:08:47,260 --> 02:08:48,460
I really think so.

1487
02:08:54,779 --> 02:08:55,500
Look at those...

1488
02:08:55,500 --> 02:08:56,619
That's the coolest thing ever.

1489
02:08:57,340 --> 02:09:06,039
Well, there you go.

1490
02:09:06,039 --> 02:09:07,319
Spike a bullet level up.

1491
02:09:07,319 --> 02:09:09,079
Triple darts is now available.

1492
02:09:09,640 --> 02:09:10,680
2,700 bucks.

1493
02:09:15,659 --> 02:09:16,539
Oh, boy.

1494
02:09:16,539 --> 02:09:17,020
It is...

1495
02:09:17,579 --> 02:09:19,560
There's a lot of...

1496
02:09:21,380 --> 02:09:22,100
I don't know.

1497
02:09:22,100 --> 02:09:25,670
We're going to have to go in here.

1498
02:09:25,670 --> 02:09:27,109
But is there enough?

1499
02:09:27,109 --> 02:09:27,750
All right.

1500
02:09:27,750 --> 02:09:28,550
You know where they are.

1501
02:09:29,430 --> 02:09:33,939
I got to move the image.

1502
02:09:33,939 --> 02:09:34,340
All right.

1503
02:09:34,340 --> 02:09:38,020
Try to make it precise.

1504
02:09:38,020 --> 02:09:39,460
It's got to be fairly precise

1505
02:09:39,460 --> 02:09:51,930
wherever you're going to click.

1506
02:09:51,930 --> 02:09:57,500
This image is not accurate.

1507
02:09:57,500 --> 02:10:03,829
Well, okay.

1508
02:10:04,630 --> 02:10:05,829
You definitely want to...

1509
02:10:05,829 --> 02:10:08,409
It looks like you're clicking on the catapult.

1510
02:10:08,409 --> 02:10:12,229
The spike a bullet.

1511
02:10:12,229 --> 02:10:14,710
That's what is being clicked on absolutely.

1512
02:10:14,710 --> 02:10:16,550
And I'm sorry to burst your bubble here, guys,

1513
02:10:16,550 --> 02:10:21,909
but you cannot buy anything.

1514
02:10:21,909 --> 02:10:23,270
No upgrades available.

1515
02:10:23,270 --> 02:10:41,560
Oh, what would you like?

1516
02:10:41,560 --> 02:10:42,279
Don't sell.

1517
02:10:45,260 --> 02:10:46,460
Well, that's currently not was...

1518
02:10:46,460 --> 02:10:46,859
Okay.

1519
02:10:46,859 --> 02:10:48,949
So it looks like you're selecting...

1520
02:10:48,949 --> 02:10:50,229
Are you selecting this one?

1521
02:10:50,229 --> 02:11:04,699
Get in there and tell me.

1522
02:11:04,699 --> 02:11:05,180
All right.

1523
02:11:05,180 --> 02:11:09,079
Yes, that is the one.

1524
02:11:09,079 --> 02:11:11,609
It is selected.

1525
02:11:11,609 --> 02:11:20,140
Well, what do you want me to do with it?

1526
02:11:20,140 --> 02:11:20,859
Triple darts.

1527
02:11:23,850 --> 02:11:24,729
Spike a bolt.

1528
02:11:24,729 --> 02:11:30,329
Could have two spike a bolts at that point.

1529
02:11:30,329 --> 02:11:31,449
Did I sell the super monkey?

1530
02:11:31,449 --> 02:11:32,329
No, he's right here.

1531
02:11:32,329 --> 02:11:34,090
All right.

1532
02:11:34,090 --> 02:11:35,050
We're going to do triple darts.

1533
02:11:39,689 --> 02:11:43,159
Almost at round 50, right?

1534
02:11:43,720 --> 02:11:51,109
More than that.

1535
02:11:51,109 --> 02:11:56,470
Are we going?

1536
02:11:56,470 --> 02:11:56,710
All right.

1537
02:11:56,710 --> 02:12:01,720
This is moved.

1538
02:12:01,720 --> 02:12:02,520
I got to fix this.

1539
02:12:02,520 --> 02:12:02,920
Hold on.

1540
02:12:08,899 --> 02:12:09,619
That was not...

1541
02:12:09,619 --> 02:12:10,100
There we go.

1542
02:12:10,100 --> 02:12:10,659
Okay.

1543
02:12:10,659 --> 02:12:11,850
Here we go.

1544
02:12:11,850 --> 02:12:19,479
This is round...

1545
02:12:20,199 --> 02:12:22,810
What does it say to run?

1546
02:12:35,880 --> 02:12:43,510
Getting overwhelming here.

1547
02:12:44,149 --> 02:12:45,430
We only have 50 lives.

1548
02:12:45,430 --> 02:12:50,119
Keep that in mind.

1549
02:12:50,119 --> 02:12:50,920
Here comes one.

1550
02:12:50,920 --> 02:12:51,640
It's going to get through.

1551
02:12:51,640 --> 02:12:52,359
It's going to get through.

1552
02:12:52,359 --> 02:12:52,680
It's going to...

1553
02:12:52,680 --> 02:12:53,399
No, it's not.

1554
02:12:53,399 --> 02:12:53,960
Lucky.

1555
02:12:53,960 --> 02:13:00,619
Here comes the next wave.

1556
02:13:00,619 --> 02:13:12,550
I'm sorry.

1557
02:13:12,550 --> 02:13:13,109
I doubted you.

1558
02:13:13,109 --> 02:13:15,479
I really had a concern there.

1559
02:13:15,479 --> 02:13:23,689
Don't doubt us, vessel.

1560
02:13:23,689 --> 02:13:24,810
Longer cannons.

1561
02:13:24,810 --> 02:13:28,119
All right.

1562
02:13:28,119 --> 02:13:29,159
Lots of up...

1563
02:13:29,159 --> 02:13:30,680
A lot of upgrades at round 50.

1564
02:13:31,720 --> 02:13:32,520
Monkey village.

1565
02:13:32,520 --> 02:13:34,119
Monkey village does not attack balloons,

1566
02:13:34,119 --> 02:13:37,079
but instead lowers cost of all towers and upgrades by 10%.

1567
02:13:38,039 --> 02:13:40,439
It's many useful upgrades that help nearby towers.

1568
02:13:40,439 --> 02:13:40,680
Okay.

1569
02:13:41,399 --> 02:13:47,689
But that's down even further.

1570
02:13:47,689 --> 02:13:47,930
All right.

1571
02:13:47,930 --> 02:13:49,130
So if you want me to go down,

1572
02:13:50,010 --> 02:13:50,810
we're going to think of another...

1573
02:13:50,810 --> 02:13:51,689
Of a solution here.

1574
02:13:55,510 --> 02:13:56,310
If you...

1575
02:13:56,310 --> 02:13:57,430
Once I open up the list,

1576
02:13:57,989 --> 02:13:59,109
if you want me to go down,

1577
02:13:59,109 --> 02:13:59,909
you have to...

1578
02:13:59,909 --> 02:14:00,550
Let's see here.

1579
02:14:04,260 --> 02:14:04,819
Yeah.

1580
02:14:04,819 --> 02:14:06,260
If you want me to go down,

1581
02:14:06,260 --> 02:14:09,859
you got to click like over...

1582
02:14:10,659 --> 02:14:11,300
Like here.

1583
02:14:13,720 --> 02:14:18,489
If you want me to click on the down arrow.

1584
02:14:18,489 --> 02:14:18,810
All right.

1585
02:14:25,060 --> 02:14:25,779
Round 50.

1586
02:14:29,260 --> 02:14:30,939
Everyone's clicking over there.

1587
02:14:32,390 --> 02:14:33,189
Take another picture.

1588
02:14:33,189 --> 02:14:34,149
That's bothering me.

1589
02:14:34,149 --> 02:14:34,630
All right.

1590
02:14:34,630 --> 02:14:36,149
Let me get another screenshot.

1591
02:14:36,149 --> 02:14:36,550
Let me get...

1592
02:14:36,550 --> 02:14:37,590
Let me clean this up.

1593
02:14:39,930 --> 02:14:46,390
So give me one second.

1594
02:14:46,390 --> 02:14:49,670
Enjoy the ocean waves while I clean these images up.

1595
02:14:58,539 --> 02:14:59,100
Okay.

1596
02:14:59,100 --> 02:14:59,659
There's that.

1597
02:15:08,250 --> 02:15:08,729
All right.

1598
02:15:08,729 --> 02:15:11,449
Let me get one more for the other ones.

1599
02:15:12,840 --> 02:15:14,520
So it doesn't look as terrible.

1600
02:15:15,159 --> 02:15:16,439
You know what I'm saying.

1601
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:28,020
What's that?

1602
02:15:28,579 --> 02:15:30,409
Let's delete this one.

1603
02:15:31,899 --> 02:15:33,100
And delete this one.

1604
02:15:38,970 --> 02:15:39,930
Just a moment.

1605
02:15:40,569 --> 02:15:51,750
Okay.

1606
02:15:52,310 --> 02:16:00,949
Get rid of that.

1607
02:16:00,949 --> 02:16:01,989
And this one.

1608
02:16:02,550 --> 02:16:05,750
So now this whole thing's up to date.

1609
02:16:05,750 --> 02:16:11,989
If it needs to be moved,

1610
02:16:11,989 --> 02:16:12,710
it needs to be moved.

1611
02:16:12,710 --> 02:16:15,770
You know what I'm saying?

1612
02:16:15,770 --> 02:16:16,170
Back to it.

1613
02:16:19,020 --> 02:16:20,300
Lord of the Rings soundtrack.

1614
02:16:26,710 --> 02:16:29,020
Hold on.

1615
02:16:29,020 --> 02:16:31,960
Lord of the Rings soundtrack.

1616
02:16:31,960 --> 02:16:33,399
This whole stream is going down.

1617
02:16:33,399 --> 02:16:38,379
Play what?

1618
02:16:38,379 --> 02:16:42,489
Airport music?

1619
02:16:42,489 --> 02:16:46,950
Some Minecraft OST.

1620
02:16:46,950 --> 02:16:48,950
Minecraft has an OST.

1621
02:16:48,950 --> 02:17:07,180
All right.

1622
02:17:07,180 --> 02:17:07,819
Back to it.

1623
02:17:07,819 --> 02:17:16,219
What do you want to do?

1624
02:17:16,219 --> 02:17:29,750
We do want a tower.

1625
02:17:29,750 --> 02:17:30,709
We did it.

1626
02:17:30,709 --> 02:17:37,180
I'm going to put everybody to sleep.

1627
02:17:37,180 --> 02:17:37,819
Oops.

1628
02:17:37,819 --> 02:17:39,129
All right.

1629
02:17:39,129 --> 02:17:39,530
Which one?

1630
02:17:57,739 --> 02:17:58,299
Oh, fuck.

1631
02:17:58,299 --> 02:18:01,559
Whoops.

1632
02:18:01,559 --> 02:18:02,040
Sorry.

1633
02:18:03,510 --> 02:18:04,549
Looks like another super monkey.

1634
02:18:10,870 --> 02:18:12,069
And where will it go?

1635
02:18:12,069 --> 02:18:12,790
I wonder.

1636
02:18:12,790 --> 02:18:18,870
Should I bring up the...

1637
02:18:19,670 --> 02:18:21,510
I wonder if I should...

1638
02:18:21,510 --> 02:18:22,709
I think I'm going to have to bring up the zoom.

1639
02:18:23,850 --> 02:18:24,409
Yeah.

1640
02:18:24,409 --> 02:18:25,370
I got to bring the zoom up.

1641
02:18:25,370 --> 02:18:26,010
Hold on.

1642
02:18:26,010 --> 02:18:33,829
Ow.

1643
02:18:33,829 --> 02:18:40,620
You're side by side.

1644
02:18:40,620 --> 02:18:53,139
You want both super monkeys right next to each other?

1645
02:18:53,139 --> 02:18:54,500
Is the vessel okay?

1646
02:18:54,500 --> 02:18:57,909
I've been better, I think.

1647
02:18:57,909 --> 02:19:00,069
All right.

1648
02:19:00,069 --> 02:19:01,030
Good placement.

1649
02:19:01,030 --> 02:19:01,909
Let's get it there.

1650
02:19:01,909 --> 02:19:06,870
Make sure it's correct.

1651
02:19:06,870 --> 02:19:08,069
Got to get it right for me.

1652
02:19:08,069 --> 02:19:13,700
It's looking like it's right below.

1653
02:19:20,340 --> 02:19:21,139
Right in the...

1654
02:19:21,139 --> 02:19:21,379
Okay.

1655
02:19:21,379 --> 02:19:21,940
I see.

1656
02:19:21,940 --> 02:19:25,700
Let me make sure I get this right.

1657
02:19:25,700 --> 02:19:38,809
How did I do, chat?

1658
02:19:38,809 --> 02:19:39,370
What's next?

1659
02:19:44,139 --> 02:19:44,459
Oof.

1660
02:19:44,459 --> 02:19:45,260
What do you mean, oof?

1661
02:19:45,260 --> 02:19:46,059
That's in a good spot.

1662
02:19:46,059 --> 02:19:47,100
What are you talking about?

1663
02:19:47,100 --> 02:19:55,690
Do you want me to click on them and upgrade them?

1664
02:19:55,690 --> 02:20:02,219
All right.

1665
02:20:02,219 --> 02:20:03,180
Super range.

1666
02:20:03,180 --> 02:20:12,090
Let's go.

1667
02:20:14,729 --> 02:20:15,690
Even more than that.

1668
02:20:15,690 --> 02:20:16,250
All right.

1669
02:20:16,250 --> 02:20:17,530
Well, hold on a second here.

1670
02:20:17,530 --> 02:20:20,489
Okay.

1671
02:20:20,489 --> 02:20:21,850
Other super monkey.

1672
02:20:21,850 --> 02:20:23,129
Other super range.

1673
02:20:23,129 --> 02:20:25,340
Is that what I'm understanding here?

1674
02:20:25,340 --> 02:20:31,219
How have you not lost yet?

1675
02:20:31,219 --> 02:20:34,409
I'm going to be real honest.

1676
02:20:34,409 --> 02:20:37,610
I thought this was going to be like a 12-minute joke.

1677
02:20:37,610 --> 02:20:56,600
We've been playing balloons for more than an hour and a half now.

1678
02:20:56,600 --> 02:21:05,270
Vessels shall remain silent.

1679
02:21:05,270 --> 02:21:05,750
All right.

1680
02:21:05,750 --> 02:21:06,309
Fine.

1681
02:21:06,309 --> 02:21:06,790
You ready?

1682
02:21:14,120 --> 02:21:14,520
Uh-oh.

1683
02:21:23,819 --> 02:21:25,260
Nothing's getting by here.

1684
02:21:25,260 --> 02:21:32,139
You guys are going to beat this level on hard.

1685
02:21:32,860 --> 02:21:39,260
Another Moab coming in.

1686
02:21:40,059 --> 02:21:41,979
It does move slow.

1687
02:21:42,860 --> 02:21:49,180
Too slow.

1688
02:21:54,709 --> 02:21:56,389
Glue splatter is unlocked.

1689
02:21:56,389 --> 02:22:04,069
Round 51.

1690
02:22:04,069 --> 02:22:08,069
Where to?

1691
02:22:08,069 --> 02:22:20,120
All right.

1692
02:22:20,120 --> 02:22:21,239
Glue gunner is selected.

1693
02:22:26,139 --> 02:22:27,420
You guys will like this now.

1694
02:22:27,420 --> 02:22:28,459
It's crazy.

1695
02:22:28,459 --> 02:22:39,129
Only $18.99 left.

1696
02:22:39,129 --> 02:22:40,649
We are unity.

1697
02:22:45,930 --> 02:22:49,139
Just as we start talking about unity.

1698
02:22:49,139 --> 02:22:51,879
Uh-oh.

1699
02:22:51,879 --> 02:22:54,549
Is this where it all falls apart?

1700
02:22:54,549 --> 02:23:01,110
I'm going to refresh it.

1701
02:23:01,110 --> 02:23:18,729
So much for the unity.

1702
02:23:18,729 --> 02:23:21,129
It seems like we need to go over here.

1703
02:23:21,129 --> 02:23:24,780
They're both the same, so I guess it doesn't matter.

1704
02:23:24,780 --> 02:23:26,459
This one looks like it has more clicks.

1705
02:23:26,459 --> 02:23:28,940
Okay.

1706
02:23:28,940 --> 02:23:39,129
The stream title is still Nickelodeon Flash Games.

1707
02:23:39,129 --> 02:23:42,379
Actually, let me change that while you guys vote for this.

1708
02:23:42,379 --> 02:23:52,760
This is Twitch Plays Bloons TD5.

1709
02:23:55,899 --> 02:23:57,340
No, like Chat Plays.

1710
02:23:57,340 --> 02:23:58,379
What do we even call this?

1711
02:23:58,379 --> 02:24:12,489
Chat Plays Bloons TD5.

1712
02:24:12,489 --> 02:24:12,969
Oh yeah.

1713
02:24:12,969 --> 02:24:16,790
Chat Clicks Bloons TD5.

1714
02:24:16,790 --> 02:24:22,579
That's a good one.

1715
02:24:22,579 --> 02:24:23,829
All right.

1716
02:24:23,829 --> 02:24:26,469
We're going to get the double shot.

1717
02:24:26,469 --> 02:24:34,229
Clicks isn't capitalized.

1718
02:24:34,549 --> 02:24:35,110
Whatever.

1719
02:24:35,110 --> 02:24:37,879
Let's do it again.

1720
02:24:37,879 --> 02:24:40,600
You want them both?

1721
02:24:40,600 --> 02:24:41,239
Sure.

1722
02:24:41,239 --> 02:24:54,420
Striever is outsourcing entertainment.

1723
02:24:54,420 --> 02:24:55,659
All right.

1724
02:24:55,659 --> 02:25:02,889
That's that.

1725
02:25:02,889 --> 02:25:03,690
51.

1726
02:25:03,690 --> 02:25:09,799
I'm going to refresh this again because I want to make sure you guys get this correctly.

1727
02:25:09,799 --> 02:25:10,360
Hold on.

1728
02:25:10,360 --> 02:25:18,469
You only got $599.

1729
02:25:18,469 --> 02:25:23,979
What are you going to do with it?

1730
02:25:23,979 --> 02:25:24,700
Oh, okay.

1731
02:25:24,700 --> 02:25:27,979
So you want to go over here and click this.

1732
02:25:32,329 --> 02:25:35,379
Okay.

1733
02:25:41,829 --> 02:25:44,420
This is so dumb.

1734
02:25:44,420 --> 02:25:44,739
Okay.

1735
02:25:44,739 --> 02:25:46,420
Are we ready for round 51?

1736
02:25:46,420 --> 02:25:49,780
Seems that way.

1737
02:25:49,780 --> 02:25:55,540
Here we go.

1738
02:25:55,540 --> 02:26:27,079
So many clicks.

1739
02:26:27,079 --> 02:26:27,799
More level up.

1740
02:26:27,799 --> 02:26:29,000
Cluster bombs are accessed.

1741
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:34,489
You got 3,500 bucks.

1742
02:26:34,489 --> 02:26:34,889
Music?

1743
02:26:34,889 --> 02:26:35,610
I muted it.

1744
02:26:35,610 --> 02:26:37,500
All right.

1745
02:26:37,500 --> 02:26:38,700
I'm done with Minecraft.

1746
02:26:38,700 --> 02:26:40,860
I don't want to hit the Minecraft OST anymore.

1747
02:26:40,860 --> 02:26:41,340
How about...

1748
02:26:41,340 --> 02:26:54,100
Hold on.

1749
02:26:54,100 --> 02:27:10,340
Okay.

1750
02:27:10,899 --> 02:27:14,860
A lot of indecision here but mostly we're going over to here.

1751
02:27:14,860 --> 02:27:16,780
Can't even upgrade them.

1752
02:27:16,780 --> 02:27:18,620
You don't have enough money.

1753
02:27:18,620 --> 02:27:35,270
It's better for you to sleep a little more.

1754
02:27:35,270 --> 02:27:36,940
Thanks.

1755
02:27:36,940 --> 02:27:39,500
I'll do it.

1756
02:27:39,500 --> 02:27:42,090
John, I'm sorry.

1757
02:27:42,090 --> 02:27:43,370
I didn't catch your name.

1758
02:27:43,370 --> 02:27:44,760
Okay.

1759
02:27:44,760 --> 02:27:45,799
Where are you from?

1760
02:27:45,799 --> 02:27:48,100
I'm from the U.S.

1761
02:27:49,139 --> 02:27:50,100
What do you want me to do here?

1762
02:27:50,100 --> 02:27:51,780
I can't do anything with this.

1763
02:27:51,780 --> 02:27:53,350
I'm on holiday.

1764
02:27:53,430 --> 02:27:54,149
I have it selected.

1765
02:27:54,149 --> 02:27:54,629
What do you want to know?

1766
02:27:54,629 --> 02:27:55,750
What's your phone number?

1767
02:27:55,750 --> 02:27:59,819
Could I take your phone number?

1768
02:27:59,819 --> 02:28:01,020
May I have your address?

1769
02:28:02,569 --> 02:28:03,530
Are you on Facebook?

1770
02:28:05,190 --> 02:28:06,069
Who do you live with?

1771
02:28:07,610 --> 02:28:08,569
I live on my own.

1772
02:28:08,569 --> 02:28:10,010
This is a real creepy lady.

1773
02:28:10,010 --> 02:28:12,540
I live with my friends.

1774
02:28:12,540 --> 02:28:13,340
How old are you?

1775
02:28:14,899 --> 02:28:15,540
I'm 30.

1776
02:28:16,340 --> 02:28:17,219
What the fuck?

1777
02:28:17,219 --> 02:28:18,100
When's your birthday?

1778
02:28:19,719 --> 02:28:20,920
It's June 16th.

1779
02:28:25,530 --> 02:28:26,329
Excuse me.

1780
02:28:26,329 --> 02:28:28,170
Do you know where the bookstore is?

1781
02:28:28,170 --> 02:28:28,729
No, I don't.

1782
02:28:28,729 --> 02:28:29,530
I'm sorry.

1783
02:28:29,530 --> 02:28:31,850
How can I get to the train station from here?

1784
02:28:31,850 --> 02:28:32,350
Walk.

1785
02:28:33,209 --> 02:28:33,930
Excuse me.

1786
02:28:33,930 --> 02:28:35,850
Could you tell me how to get to the bus station?

1787
02:28:36,649 --> 02:28:37,370
Ride your bike.

1788
02:28:37,370 --> 02:28:39,370
Can you show me the way to the post office?

1789
02:28:39,930 --> 02:28:40,489
Take a right.

1790
02:28:41,129 --> 02:28:41,930
Excuse me.

1791
02:28:41,930 --> 02:28:43,370
Where is the hospital?

1792
02:28:43,370 --> 02:28:43,930
In front of you.

1793
02:28:44,569 --> 02:28:45,770
Can you show me on the map?

1794
02:28:46,329 --> 02:28:47,049
Right here.

1795
02:28:47,049 --> 02:28:47,530
Look.

1796
02:28:47,530 --> 02:28:49,450
What's the best way to get to the airport?

1797
02:28:50,409 --> 02:28:51,049
Take an Uber.

1798
02:28:51,049 --> 02:28:53,129
What's the fastest way to the airport?

1799
02:28:53,129 --> 02:28:53,690
Get an Uber.

1800
02:28:54,329 --> 02:28:54,969
And it's quick.

1801
02:28:54,969 --> 02:28:56,250
How far is it to the stadium from here?

1802
02:28:57,290 --> 02:28:57,850
15 miles.

1803
02:28:57,850 --> 02:28:59,290
What street is this?

1804
02:28:59,290 --> 02:28:59,690
This is...

1805
02:29:00,489 --> 02:29:02,250
Is this the way to the police station?

1806
02:29:02,250 --> 02:29:02,889
No.

1807
02:29:02,889 --> 02:29:03,770
You're on your way to the...

1808
02:29:04,250 --> 02:29:05,610
Is there a supermarket near here?

1809
02:29:05,610 --> 02:29:06,010
There are.

1810
02:29:06,979 --> 02:29:09,540
Can you give me directions to the gas station?

1811
02:29:09,540 --> 02:29:09,780
Yes.

1812
02:29:09,780 --> 02:29:11,780
If you take a left at the end of this road and you go straight...

1813
02:29:11,780 --> 02:29:11,860
Go straight on.

1814
02:29:11,860 --> 02:29:12,500
Yes, go straight ahead.

1815
02:29:12,500 --> 02:29:13,219
That's right.

1816
02:29:13,219 --> 02:29:15,059
Turn right at the crossroads.

1817
02:29:15,059 --> 02:29:15,540
Yeah.

1818
02:29:15,540 --> 02:29:16,420
Well, no, that's not correct.

1819
02:29:16,420 --> 02:29:19,219
Keep going straight ahead for about 500 meters.

1820
02:29:19,219 --> 02:29:20,579
No, I don't know why you're doing this.

1821
02:29:20,579 --> 02:29:21,540
You asked me for directions.

1822
02:29:21,540 --> 02:29:22,819
The bus station will be on your left.

1823
02:29:22,819 --> 02:29:23,940
Well, that's where you should go, then.

1824
02:29:23,940 --> 02:29:24,979
You should go to the bus station and get on the bus.

1825
02:29:24,979 --> 02:29:25,940
You're going the wrong way.

1826
02:29:25,940 --> 02:29:27,379
I'm not driving a car.

1827
02:29:27,379 --> 02:29:28,500
It's about one mile...

1828
02:29:28,500 --> 02:29:30,180
We are not in a car together.

1829
02:29:30,180 --> 02:29:34,860
What do you do?

1830
02:29:35,819 --> 02:29:37,639
What do you do for a living?

1831
02:29:38,200 --> 02:29:39,159
Online video.

1832
02:29:39,159 --> 02:29:40,760
I've got a part-time job.

1833
02:29:40,760 --> 02:29:42,090
Nice.

1834
02:29:42,090 --> 02:29:42,889
Where do you work?

1835
02:29:44,409 --> 02:29:45,690
I work from home.

1836
02:29:45,690 --> 02:29:46,329
Me too.

1837
02:29:46,329 --> 02:29:47,209
Hey, we got that in common.

1838
02:29:47,209 --> 02:29:48,329
I work in a factory.

1839
02:29:48,329 --> 02:29:50,329
How do you work from home in a factory?

1840
02:29:50,329 --> 02:29:52,149
What is your occupation?

1841
02:29:52,149 --> 02:29:53,270
I work as a doctor.

1842
02:29:53,270 --> 02:29:55,829
I'm looking for a job.

1843
02:29:57,219 --> 02:29:58,020
I'm a teacher.

1844
02:29:59,610 --> 02:30:01,049
I'm not working at the moment.

1845
02:30:01,049 --> 02:30:02,489
Oh, you've lost your mind, Lynn.

1846
02:30:02,489 --> 02:30:03,370
I'm unemployed.

1847
02:30:04,329 --> 02:30:05,850
I do the paperwork.

1848
02:30:06,409 --> 02:30:08,549
I have my own business.

1849
02:30:10,229 --> 02:30:11,190
Do you like your job?

1850
02:30:11,909 --> 02:30:15,899
Yes, it's great.

1851
02:30:15,899 --> 02:30:17,260
I completely agree.

1852
02:30:18,620 --> 02:30:19,260
I agree, too.

1853
02:30:19,260 --> 02:30:20,620
You're absolutely right.

1854
02:30:20,620 --> 02:30:23,639
I agree with you entirely.

1855
02:30:23,639 --> 02:30:24,520
Do what you like.

1856
02:30:24,520 --> 02:30:25,079
Have fun doing it.

1857
02:30:25,079 --> 02:30:26,280
I totally agree with you.

1858
02:30:26,280 --> 02:30:27,799
And, you know, if you make some money, make some money.

1859
02:30:27,799 --> 02:30:28,360
You know what I'm saying?

1860
02:30:28,360 --> 02:30:29,079
I agree more.

1861
02:30:29,979 --> 02:30:30,700
Right.

1862
02:30:30,700 --> 02:30:31,659
Exactly.

1863
02:30:31,659 --> 02:30:32,940
I know, right?

1864
02:30:32,940 --> 02:30:33,979
Absolutely.

1865
02:30:33,979 --> 02:30:35,180
That's what I was trying to say.

1866
02:30:35,180 --> 02:30:35,899
You're right.

1867
02:30:35,899 --> 02:30:36,540
You're right.

1868
02:30:37,260 --> 02:30:38,059
Me too.

1869
02:30:38,059 --> 02:30:38,620
I know.

1870
02:30:38,620 --> 02:30:39,500
That's what I just said.

1871
02:30:39,500 --> 02:30:40,379
I agree.

1872
02:30:40,379 --> 02:30:41,100
Me.

1873
02:30:41,739 --> 02:30:43,659
I see exactly what you mean.

1874
02:30:43,659 --> 02:30:43,899
Yes.

1875
02:30:44,940 --> 02:30:46,899
That's exactly what I mean.

1876
02:30:46,899 --> 02:30:47,940
We both think so alike.

1877
02:30:47,940 --> 02:30:49,940
There is no doubt about it.

1878
02:30:49,940 --> 02:30:50,579
No, there isn't.

1879
02:30:50,579 --> 02:30:52,420
I agree up to a point.

1880
02:30:52,420 --> 02:30:52,979
Up to?

1881
02:30:52,979 --> 02:30:53,700
Hold on a second here.

1882
02:30:53,700 --> 02:30:54,420
Hold on.

1883
02:30:54,420 --> 02:30:55,780
That's partly true.

1884
02:30:55,780 --> 02:30:56,420
No, that's...

1885
02:30:56,420 --> 02:30:57,860
I don't know if I agree with you right there.

1886
02:30:57,860 --> 02:31:00,139
That may be true.

1887
02:31:00,139 --> 02:31:01,260
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1888
02:31:01,260 --> 02:31:02,860
I see your point, but...

1889
02:31:03,659 --> 02:31:06,299
Well, I don't know how this turned so poorly,

1890
02:31:06,299 --> 02:31:07,500
but I don't agree with you.

1891
02:31:07,500 --> 02:31:08,620
That seems obvious.

1892
02:31:09,879 --> 02:31:10,920
That's a dumb thing to say.

1893
02:31:10,920 --> 02:31:12,340
I'm not so sure about it.

1894
02:31:12,340 --> 02:31:14,020
Yeah, I'm not entirely sure about this.

1895
02:31:14,020 --> 02:31:14,819
I don't agree.

1896
02:31:14,979 --> 02:31:15,700
No, neither do I.

1897
02:31:16,260 --> 02:31:17,299
I don't agree with you.

1898
02:31:17,299 --> 02:31:18,819
I don't fucking agree with you.

1899
02:31:18,819 --> 02:31:20,260
I totally disagree.

1900
02:31:20,260 --> 02:31:21,540
Yeah, you're an idiot.

1901
02:31:21,540 --> 02:31:22,100
An imbecile.

1902
02:31:22,100 --> 02:31:23,459
I'm sorry, but I disagree.

1903
02:31:23,459 --> 02:31:24,979
No, you should not be trusted ever.

1904
02:31:24,979 --> 02:31:26,020
Absolutely not.

1905
02:31:26,020 --> 02:31:27,059
No, you get out of my house.

1906
02:31:27,059 --> 02:31:27,860
How about that?

1907
02:31:27,860 --> 02:31:29,299
I invited you over here.

1908
02:31:29,299 --> 02:31:31,139
You took the fucking bus here, lady.

1909
02:31:31,139 --> 02:31:32,020
That's not right.

1910
02:31:32,020 --> 02:31:33,059
Yeah, and you asked for directions,

1911
02:31:33,059 --> 02:31:33,860
and I tried to give you directions.

1912
02:31:33,860 --> 02:31:34,899
That's not always true.

1913
02:31:34,899 --> 02:31:35,459
No, yes it is,

1914
02:31:35,459 --> 02:31:36,500
because I gave you directions earlier

1915
02:31:36,500 --> 02:31:37,299
and you didn't care.

1916
02:31:37,299 --> 02:31:38,260
Yes, it was what happened,

1917
02:31:38,260 --> 02:31:39,299
so stop fucking interrupting me.

1918
02:31:39,299 --> 02:31:39,940
That's not true.

1919
02:31:39,940 --> 02:31:40,739
That is what happened,

1920
02:31:40,739 --> 02:31:41,700
so stop fucking interrupting me.

1921
02:31:41,700 --> 02:31:42,500
No way.

1922
02:31:42,500 --> 02:31:43,379
Yes, it is.

1923
02:31:43,379 --> 02:31:45,690
You knocked on my door,

1924
02:31:45,690 --> 02:31:47,049
and you asked for fucking directions

1925
02:31:47,049 --> 02:31:47,450
to a bus-

1926
02:31:47,450 --> 02:31:49,540
Do you understand?

1927
02:31:49,540 --> 02:31:50,819
Are you following me?

1928
02:31:50,819 --> 02:31:53,450
Do you understand what I mean?

1929
02:31:58,200 --> 02:32:01,299
Are we ready for the next-

1930
02:32:01,299 --> 02:32:02,500
Are you ready for the next-

1931
02:32:02,500 --> 02:32:05,270
What are we doing now?

1932
02:32:05,270 --> 02:32:13,719
Is this tax or is this go?

1933
02:32:13,719 --> 02:32:14,280
I'm not sure.

1934
02:32:23,190 --> 02:32:24,389
All right, you want this?

1935
02:32:24,389 --> 02:32:25,430
Looks like we're gonna go.

1936
02:32:25,430 --> 02:32:51,780
Here comes the next round.

1937
02:32:51,780 --> 02:32:52,579
This fits pretty well.

1938
02:32:59,799 --> 02:33:01,399
You guys have made an unstoppable team here.

1939
02:33:01,399 --> 02:33:02,040
They can't do anything.

1940
02:33:02,040 --> 02:33:03,500
We gotta go faster.

1941
02:33:03,500 --> 02:33:04,459
Ooh, what happened?

1942
02:33:04,459 --> 02:33:24,739
Pretty good.

1943
02:33:24,739 --> 02:33:29,610
What are we doing now?

1944
02:33:40,899 --> 02:33:41,540
Super Monkey?

1945
02:33:42,500 --> 02:33:45,020
Are we doing Laser 2.0?

1946
02:33:50,170 --> 02:33:51,129
I can really start to follow

1947
02:33:51,129 --> 02:33:52,409
your guys' mindset here.

1948
02:33:52,409 --> 02:33:52,809
It's great.

1949
02:33:53,450 --> 02:33:59,299
Oh, yeah, of course.

1950
02:34:00,340 --> 02:34:03,049
Wait, wait, wait.

1951
02:34:03,049 --> 02:34:04,090
Have people seen Other Monkey?

1952
02:34:04,090 --> 02:34:04,649
There's-

1953
02:34:04,649 --> 02:34:05,610
I can't do Other Monkey.

1954
02:34:06,409 --> 02:34:07,370
This is the only one we can do.

1955
02:34:13,030 --> 02:34:14,469
Okay, make sure we're sure about this

1956
02:34:15,190 --> 02:34:16,790
because I'm seeing some descent here.

1957
02:34:17,350 --> 02:34:19,420
Here we go.

1958
02:34:20,059 --> 02:34:28,149
I completely disagree with you.

1959
02:34:28,790 --> 02:34:31,739
I'm not so sure about that.

1960
02:34:31,739 --> 02:34:35,129
The vessel is starting to turn into a leader.

1961
02:34:35,129 --> 02:34:35,850
It's time to revolt.

1962
02:34:44,629 --> 02:34:45,030
All right.

1963
02:34:45,670 --> 02:34:48,459
You guys got a chance to double check

1964
02:34:48,459 --> 02:34:49,420
to see if you want to do it.

1965
02:34:49,420 --> 02:34:49,899
And here you go.

1966
02:34:51,479 --> 02:34:52,040
Good luck.

1967
02:34:52,040 --> 02:35:09,430
Need to anoint a new vessel.

1968
02:35:23,799 --> 02:35:25,559
This stream keeps getting worse.

1969
02:35:26,360 --> 02:35:26,680
What?

1970
02:35:29,020 --> 02:35:29,340
Why?

1971
02:35:29,899 --> 02:35:35,370
The stream's getting worse.

1972
02:35:36,170 --> 02:35:43,559
I already know what you guys want me to do.

1973
02:35:53,819 --> 02:35:54,459
Plasma.

1974
02:35:55,530 --> 02:35:57,559
Plasma blasts.

1975
02:35:57,559 --> 02:36:00,360
Plasma vaporizes everything it touches.

1976
02:36:00,360 --> 02:36:02,979
That's it.

1977
02:36:02,979 --> 02:36:04,260
I can't afford anything else.

1978
02:36:04,260 --> 02:36:05,059
You guys-

1979
02:36:05,059 --> 02:36:05,459
That's it.

1980
02:36:05,459 --> 02:36:05,860
You're done.

1981
02:36:22,549 --> 02:36:24,870
What is going on over here?

1982
02:36:24,870 --> 02:36:28,790
What is happening over here?

1983
02:36:28,790 --> 02:36:30,389
Why are people losing their minds over here?

1984
02:36:33,270 --> 02:36:33,829
And this-

1985
02:36:34,469 --> 02:36:36,760
37% of you don't agree.

1986
02:36:43,020 --> 02:36:43,420
All right.

1987
02:36:44,739 --> 02:36:45,219
Let's go.

1988
02:36:45,780 --> 02:36:53,879
Look at that plasma ray.

1989
02:36:54,680 --> 02:37:06,860
We've only done five rounds in 30 minutes.

1990
02:37:08,299 --> 02:37:10,379
Because the rounds are getting more difficult.

1991
02:37:10,379 --> 02:37:11,659
They need to have more deliberation.

1992
02:37:27,020 --> 02:37:28,139
Buccaneer, level up.

1993
02:37:28,139 --> 02:37:32,100
Super Monkey, level up.

1994
02:37:32,100 --> 02:37:32,899
56.

1995
02:37:33,860 --> 02:37:36,260
Where to?

1996
02:37:36,260 --> 02:37:39,180
Okay, I can't take this anymore.

1997
02:37:39,739 --> 02:37:50,489
How about epic?

1998
02:37:50,489 --> 02:37:56,729
Put on RuneScape music.

1999
02:38:07,930 --> 02:38:09,770
RuneScape music?

2000
02:38:09,770 --> 02:38:13,260
I've never even played RuneScape.

2001
02:38:13,260 --> 02:38:14,379
It has music.

2002
02:38:14,379 --> 02:38:21,180
All right, here you go.

2003
02:38:21,180 --> 02:38:26,569
All right, looks like Buccaneer.

2004
02:38:27,129 --> 02:38:41,399
I'm gonna refresh it just because everyone was clicking on other stuff.

2005
02:38:41,399 --> 02:38:42,200
Here we go.

2006
02:38:42,200 --> 02:38:52,299
Can we please play RuneScape after this?

2007
02:38:54,969 --> 02:38:56,569
This is it for tonight.

2008
02:38:56,569 --> 02:39:06,459
All right, the people have spoken.

2009
02:39:09,700 --> 02:39:11,620
Three, two, one, bring it up.

2010
02:39:17,239 --> 02:39:18,120
The other one too?

2011
02:39:18,120 --> 02:39:22,360
Longer cannon.

2012
02:39:22,360 --> 02:39:24,280
Three, two, one, here it comes.

2013
02:39:24,680 --> 02:39:33,430
Uh, looks like Super Monkey.

2014
02:39:33,430 --> 02:39:34,389
Which one?

2015
02:39:34,389 --> 02:39:35,450
Could be either.

2016
02:39:35,450 --> 02:39:37,479
I think it's this one though.

2017
02:39:37,479 --> 02:39:38,840
It could be really either one of them.

2018
02:39:48,540 --> 02:39:49,819
Doesn't matter which one.

2019
02:39:49,819 --> 02:39:55,110
This seems to have more votes.

2020
02:39:55,670 --> 02:40:05,700
Are you guys sure?

2021
02:40:05,700 --> 02:40:12,069
Is this Yoshi's story?

2022
02:40:12,069 --> 02:40:22,120
Okay, time to start.

2023
02:40:22,120 --> 02:40:24,889
Let's go.

2024
02:40:24,889 --> 02:40:44,180
Nothing even stands a chance.

2025
02:40:44,180 --> 02:40:46,649
Nothing even stands a chance.

2026
02:40:46,649 --> 02:40:47,530
Did you see that shit?

2027
02:40:47,530 --> 02:40:49,290
Nothing even stands a chance right now.

2028
02:40:49,290 --> 02:40:49,930
It's 57.

2029
02:40:49,930 --> 02:40:51,370
I was at level 60.

2030
02:40:51,370 --> 02:41:02,579
It's just too easy for you guys.

2031
02:41:02,579 --> 02:41:04,340
You guys are making this look simple.

2032
02:41:04,340 --> 02:41:09,850
All right, we're going again.

2033
02:41:35,379 --> 02:41:36,899
Masterfully done, guys.

2034
02:41:39,590 --> 02:41:43,479
Balloon Dissolver for a glue gunner.

2035
02:41:43,479 --> 02:41:44,440
Moab Mauler.

2036
02:41:45,860 --> 02:41:48,420
And rank up Mortar Tower.

2037
02:41:48,420 --> 02:41:49,829
Rank 17.

2038
02:41:49,829 --> 02:41:50,549
There it is.

2039
02:41:50,549 --> 02:41:52,469
So here's the down arrow.

2040
02:41:52,469 --> 02:41:57,049
You get the village, the banana farm, and Mortar Tower.

2041
02:41:57,049 --> 02:41:59,479
Level 58.

2042
02:42:00,040 --> 02:42:02,780
I got faith in you guys.

2043
02:42:03,340 --> 02:42:09,659
Looks like it's split between...

2044
02:42:11,530 --> 02:42:14,649
I feel bad for all the people that want to upgrade the wizard so bad.

2045
02:42:14,649 --> 02:42:16,329
Boy, they have never had an opportunity to.

2046
02:42:19,020 --> 02:42:20,860
All right, we are opening up.

2047
02:42:21,020 --> 02:42:23,739
Ooh, one, two, three, four.

2048
02:42:23,739 --> 02:42:25,819
We got 14, 12, 11, 15.

2049
02:42:25,819 --> 02:42:28,200
Look at all the percentages here.

2050
02:42:28,200 --> 02:42:33,299
Half of the whole entire stream right now does not want to do this.

2051
02:42:33,299 --> 02:42:34,579
But that's what happens, man.

2052
02:42:34,579 --> 02:42:36,260
We got to stick with what we're doing.

2053
02:42:36,819 --> 02:42:44,229
Okay, let's open it up.

2054
02:42:44,229 --> 02:42:48,260
Which tower do you want?

2055
02:42:48,260 --> 02:42:52,020
And again, keep in mind, remember, if you want me to go down,

2056
02:42:52,020 --> 02:42:54,020
you need to select over here.

2057
02:42:56,579 --> 02:42:56,899
Ready?

2058
02:43:06,170 --> 02:43:06,649
Jesus.

2059
02:43:07,959 --> 02:43:08,840
Yeah, over here.

2060
02:43:08,840 --> 02:43:10,360
If you want me to click the down arrow,

2061
02:43:10,840 --> 02:43:13,340
but then we run into another problem where I need this.

2062
02:43:14,649 --> 02:43:16,170
I'm going to have to do this in a different way.

2063
02:43:19,459 --> 02:43:21,059
All right, so it looks like I'm going down.

2064
02:43:21,780 --> 02:43:24,299
But hold on here.

2065
02:43:28,329 --> 02:43:29,370
So let's go down.

2066
02:43:31,979 --> 02:43:36,299
So if you want the village, click up here.

2067
02:43:37,239 --> 02:43:39,959
If you want the banana farm, click up here.

2068
02:43:40,600 --> 02:43:43,000
If you want the Mortar Tower, click down here.

2069
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:43,559
You understand?

2070
02:43:44,569 --> 02:43:45,209
Go.

2071
02:43:45,209 --> 02:44:06,260
Looks like it's going to be the village.

2072
02:44:06,260 --> 02:44:07,459
By a lot, actually.

2073
02:44:07,459 --> 02:44:08,739
So, all right.

2074
02:44:08,739 --> 02:44:14,100
Where do you want it?

2075
02:44:14,100 --> 02:44:15,540
Where do you want the village?

2076
02:44:15,540 --> 02:44:17,139
Let's see, do we need to zoom in for this?

2077
02:44:17,139 --> 02:44:20,540
We might not even need to.

2078
02:44:20,540 --> 02:44:23,100
You guys want it right in here, but I don't think I can fit it here.

2079
02:44:24,139 --> 02:44:24,940
It's too crowded.

2080
02:44:29,450 --> 02:44:30,809
I could get it right there.

2081
02:44:30,809 --> 02:44:31,930
Let's enhance.

2082
02:44:31,930 --> 02:44:40,920
Where do you want it?

2083
02:44:40,920 --> 02:44:43,000
There's a second Super Monkey though.

2084
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:44,579
Just be aware of that.

2085
02:44:44,579 --> 02:44:45,860
Below the first Super Monkey.

2086
02:44:56,090 --> 02:44:57,450
The stream will never end.

2087
02:45:09,270 --> 02:45:17,059
All right, right next to the bottom left of the glue gunner.

2088
02:45:17,059 --> 02:45:24,409
That's close.

2089
02:45:24,409 --> 02:45:25,610
That's so close.

2090
02:45:25,610 --> 02:45:27,209
I'm going to refresh it again.

2091
02:45:27,209 --> 02:45:29,850
All right, you ready?

2092
02:45:29,850 --> 02:45:55,100
Go for it again.

2093
02:45:55,100 --> 02:45:57,979
Well, you've spoken.

2094
02:45:57,979 --> 02:45:59,100
It's going above.

2095
02:45:59,100 --> 02:46:04,840
So, right here.

2096
02:46:05,899 --> 02:46:10,549
That's as close as I can get it.

2097
02:46:10,549 --> 02:46:11,350
There.

2098
02:46:11,350 --> 02:46:24,360
Anything else?

2099
02:46:24,360 --> 02:46:27,879
Why is Runescape 07 music playing?

2100
02:46:27,879 --> 02:46:30,280
That's a great question.

2101
02:46:30,280 --> 02:46:32,120
Somebody wrote it in chat and I clicked on it.

2102
02:46:32,120 --> 02:46:33,239
I think we have to zoom in for this.

2103
02:46:36,149 --> 02:46:37,110
Yeah, try it again.

2104
02:46:52,309 --> 02:46:55,670
So, that's the second Super Monkey, right?

2105
02:46:55,670 --> 02:46:59,290
From my understanding.

2106
02:46:59,290 --> 02:47:07,110
So, you guys are selecting the second Super Monkey.

2107
02:47:07,110 --> 02:47:09,129
Or is it the glue?

2108
02:47:09,690 --> 02:47:24,059
All right, if you want this Super...

2109
02:47:25,100 --> 02:47:26,459
I'm going to have to take another picture.

2110
02:47:27,020 --> 02:47:31,059
This is the slowest stream I'm trying.

2111
02:47:31,059 --> 02:47:31,940
It's hard.

2112
02:47:31,940 --> 02:47:48,489
I'm going to have to go more zoom on this.

2113
02:47:48,489 --> 02:47:49,690
All right, show me.

2114
02:47:49,690 --> 02:47:54,809
Remember the Super Monkey.

2115
02:47:54,809 --> 02:47:56,409
There's another Super Monkey down there, right?

2116
02:47:56,409 --> 02:48:07,299
Yeah, there you go.

2117
02:48:07,299 --> 02:48:10,389
A wizard it is.

2118
02:48:10,389 --> 02:48:13,670
After like 30 rounds of people wanting to upgrade.

2119
02:48:13,670 --> 02:48:16,969
There's only one wizard upgrade.

2120
02:48:16,969 --> 02:48:21,989
I'm pretty sure I know which one it is.

2121
02:48:21,989 --> 02:48:26,219
What the fuck did I do to this?

2122
02:48:26,780 --> 02:48:41,379
All right, there's only one wizard upgrade.

2123
02:48:46,889 --> 02:48:47,930
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2124
02:48:47,930 --> 02:48:48,729
Wait a minute.

2125
02:48:48,729 --> 02:48:49,450
What's going on here?

2126
02:48:55,579 --> 02:48:56,540
Sell the wizard.

2127
02:49:00,200 --> 02:49:01,000
Holy shit.

2128
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:08,760
Okay, I thought that's surprising.

2129
02:49:08,760 --> 02:49:09,639
Might be strong.

2130
02:49:09,639 --> 02:49:11,000
Yeah, you're right, it might be.

2131
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:12,680
But not even going to need to see it.

2132
02:49:12,680 --> 02:49:16,440
2250 bucks.

2133
02:49:16,440 --> 02:49:28,649
Where are we off to?

2134
02:49:28,649 --> 02:49:30,250
This seems like a go scenario.

2135
02:49:30,250 --> 02:49:31,290
Round 58.

2136
02:49:31,290 --> 02:49:53,799
Like the Glover soundtrack?

2137
02:49:53,799 --> 02:49:55,479
How do you even know what that game is?

2138
02:49:55,479 --> 02:50:16,250
Is it a video that I made 10 years ago?

2139
02:50:16,250 --> 02:50:18,420
I never made a video on Glover.

2140
02:50:18,420 --> 02:50:19,219
I don't think I did.

2141
02:50:23,989 --> 02:50:28,170
What the hell is happening?

2142
02:50:28,170 --> 02:50:29,049
What was that?

2143
02:50:29,049 --> 02:50:30,700
Why did they go back?

2144
02:50:30,700 --> 02:50:37,479
That was the wizard power makes them go backwards?

2145
02:50:38,780 --> 02:50:40,540
Now I know why everybody wanted to vote for that.

2146
02:50:44,659 --> 02:50:47,139
I'm going to sneeze and I'm sorry about it.

2147
02:50:47,780 --> 02:50:51,370
I have a mute button, I forgot.

2148
02:50:55,110 --> 02:50:57,430
All right, I'm going to turn off the Castlevania 2 music.

2149
02:51:04,969 --> 02:51:06,010
And let's get...

2150
02:51:08,840 --> 02:51:10,040
There's a lot of...

2151
02:51:10,040 --> 02:51:11,719
I don't know what people want in here.

2152
02:51:19,620 --> 02:51:20,899
FTL soundtrack?

2153
02:51:20,899 --> 02:51:22,420
I've never even played FTL.

2154
02:51:30,010 --> 02:51:32,760
Okay, zooming in.

2155
02:51:36,379 --> 02:51:38,059
There's a lot of people clicking here.

2156
02:51:38,059 --> 02:51:53,930
So try it again.

2157
02:51:53,930 --> 02:51:56,569
Looks like we're going over here to the left.

2158
02:52:01,610 --> 02:52:02,969
Doesn't matter which one.

2159
02:52:02,969 --> 02:52:04,809
I can only upgrade the left one.

2160
02:52:11,399 --> 02:52:14,360
So left one it is because the right one cannot be upgraded.

2161
02:52:14,360 --> 02:52:15,799
So left one, which one do you want?

2162
02:52:24,020 --> 02:52:26,420
Flash bomb or double shot?

2163
02:52:26,420 --> 02:52:29,000
Flash bomb is very expensive.

2164
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:32,120
Sometimes throws a flash bomb that stuns balloons in a large radius.

2165
02:52:32,760 --> 02:52:38,780
Hopefully you spent that money wisely.

2166
02:52:42,250 --> 02:52:46,469
Can't do anything else there.

2167
02:52:46,469 --> 02:52:47,270
Round 59.

2168
02:52:54,229 --> 02:52:54,870
All right, let's go.

2169
02:53:12,010 --> 02:53:13,770
We're going to be here for hours.

2170
02:53:13,770 --> 02:53:19,559
I don't know.

2171
02:53:23,959 --> 02:53:27,559
It could go either way because from 60 and beyond.

2172
02:53:28,040 --> 02:53:30,040
I think is when it's going to start to get actually very difficult.

2173
02:53:33,500 --> 02:53:33,979
We won.

2174
02:53:33,979 --> 02:53:34,860
It's time to stop.

2175
02:53:36,250 --> 02:53:37,690
We can't stop now.

2176
02:53:37,690 --> 02:53:39,209
That would be a huge mistake.

2177
02:53:52,620 --> 02:54:02,340
100% want to go right to the village.

2178
02:54:02,340 --> 02:54:03,219
86%.

2179
02:54:03,219 --> 02:54:05,139
This is probably like 70% right here.

2180
02:54:05,139 --> 02:54:05,540
All right.

2181
02:54:11,909 --> 02:54:14,709
Beacon increased attack range of all towers within the monkey village.

2182
02:54:15,270 --> 02:54:21,510
Okay, where to next?

2183
02:54:28,149 --> 02:54:29,510
Tactical hive mind.

2184
02:54:34,680 --> 02:54:36,040
What is it being clicked on over here?

2185
02:54:44,549 --> 02:54:49,129
My special agent.

2186
02:54:49,450 --> 02:54:53,700
I'm not sure if this is the super monkey or the glue gunner.

2187
02:54:53,700 --> 02:54:56,860
Let me go ahead and zoom it in.

2188
02:54:56,860 --> 02:55:04,149
Which one is this?

2189
02:55:04,149 --> 02:55:05,979
Which one are you clicking on here?

2190
02:55:05,979 --> 02:55:13,239
Glue gunner, okay.

2191
02:55:13,239 --> 02:55:19,770
He is selected.

2192
02:55:19,770 --> 02:55:32,840
What would you like to do with them?

2193
02:55:32,840 --> 02:55:33,479
All right.

2194
02:55:33,479 --> 02:55:34,600
Balloon dissolver.

2195
02:55:35,819 --> 02:55:37,420
$877.

2196
02:55:37,420 --> 02:55:39,180
Don't think this is not about what you guys can do.

2197
02:55:48,170 --> 02:55:48,569
Good luck.

2198
02:55:55,590 --> 02:55:56,790
What is that?

2199
02:55:56,790 --> 02:55:59,620
Okay, that's the super moab.

2200
02:56:00,180 --> 02:56:05,100
The super moab turns into five regular moabs.

2201
02:56:11,100 --> 02:56:12,459
Just decimated.

2202
02:56:12,459 --> 02:56:13,739
Absolutely decimated.

2203
02:56:14,379 --> 02:56:16,540
That could have been really scary, but it wasn't at all.

2204
02:56:16,540 --> 02:56:17,180
Not at all.

2205
02:56:26,020 --> 02:56:26,500
Again?

2206
02:56:26,500 --> 02:56:27,139
Go again?

2207
02:56:27,139 --> 02:56:27,620
Sure thing.

2208
02:56:27,620 --> 02:56:28,100
Let's go.

2209
02:56:28,739 --> 02:56:45,379
This is the coolest tower.

2210
02:56:49,479 --> 02:56:50,840
Getting carried through balloons.

2211
02:56:51,479 --> 02:56:56,500
Hey, look at this shit.

2212
02:56:56,500 --> 02:56:58,020
They can't even do anything.

2213
02:56:58,020 --> 02:57:00,540
Apprentice level up lightning bolt.

2214
02:57:01,260 --> 02:57:02,620
62 of 85.

2215
02:57:05,799 --> 02:57:06,840
4,600 bucks.

2216
02:57:09,139 --> 02:57:10,979
And we are going to...

2217
02:57:10,979 --> 02:57:12,100
Looks like it wants...

2218
02:57:14,340 --> 02:57:15,700
I think this is a living entity.

2219
02:57:15,700 --> 02:57:19,219
Okay, it wants to select the wizard, I think.

2220
02:57:22,780 --> 02:57:24,059
Yeah, this is definitely on the wizard.

2221
02:57:24,459 --> 02:57:32,059
This is probably 70 or 80% of the vote over here.

2222
02:57:32,059 --> 02:57:35,540
And I guarantee it's the zap.

2223
02:57:35,540 --> 02:57:36,260
It is.

2224
02:57:36,260 --> 02:57:36,979
Would you look at that?

2225
02:57:36,979 --> 02:57:39,700
Unleash the power of lightning to zap many balloons at once.

2226
02:57:39,700 --> 02:57:47,639
What else would you like to do?

2227
02:57:47,639 --> 02:57:49,930
Oh, this is getting interesting.

2228
02:57:49,930 --> 02:57:53,209
Okay, now we're buying a special agent.

2229
02:57:54,170 --> 02:57:54,969
Not yet, no.

2230
02:57:56,229 --> 02:57:56,549
Start...

2231
02:57:56,549 --> 02:57:57,510
Looked like it for a second.

2232
02:58:06,899 --> 02:58:07,139
Okay.

2233
02:58:09,049 --> 02:58:09,770
This is...

2234
02:58:09,770 --> 02:58:11,610
Epic range is the only thing to buy here.

2235
02:58:18,700 --> 02:58:19,659
Even bigger range.

2236
02:58:22,540 --> 02:58:23,500
74%.

2237
02:58:25,459 --> 02:58:26,100
73%.

2238
02:58:27,139 --> 02:58:28,600
Okay.

2239
02:58:36,659 --> 02:58:37,219
Anything else?

2240
02:58:42,700 --> 02:58:43,659
Chat sucks.

2241
02:58:43,659 --> 02:58:43,899
What?

2242
02:58:46,020 --> 02:58:47,459
Here's round 62.

2243
02:58:53,559 --> 02:58:54,360
No, I didn't say that.

2244
02:58:54,360 --> 02:58:55,719
I was just quoting what somebody said.

2245
02:59:08,040 --> 02:59:09,799
Music change, I'll do it after this.

2246
02:59:09,799 --> 02:59:24,170
Nothing can even get by.

2247
02:59:24,809 --> 02:59:27,559
This is probably going to go all the way.

2248
02:59:29,180 --> 02:59:30,620
They can't even come down the first lane.

2249
02:59:32,569 --> 02:59:33,770
Excellent placement here, guys.

2250
02:59:35,879 --> 02:59:36,360
For real.

2251
02:59:37,399 --> 02:59:38,040
Nice work.

2252
02:59:39,780 --> 02:59:41,219
Sun god for the super monkey.

2253
02:59:41,219 --> 02:59:43,459
It is said that balloons who doth touch the sun

2254
02:59:44,409 --> 02:59:46,569
shall be cleansed and then there shall be peace.

2255
02:59:46,809 --> 02:59:47,370
Sun god.

2256
02:59:50,120 --> 02:59:50,840
Monkey fort.

2257
02:59:51,739 --> 02:59:53,180
Curses popping power by one.

2258
02:59:54,860 --> 02:59:57,260
And then dartling gun.

2259
02:59:57,260 --> 02:59:58,299
Darts like a machine gun.

2260
02:59:59,659 --> 03:00:05,459
All right, guys.

2261
03:00:06,020 --> 03:00:08,280
What's the plan here?

2262
03:00:14,440 --> 03:00:16,520
66% of you want to go in this area here.

2263
03:00:17,079 --> 03:00:22,020
I'm going to zoom it in.

2264
03:00:22,020 --> 03:00:23,700
Remember the super monkey is down here.

2265
03:00:24,579 --> 03:00:26,579
Click down there if you want to.

2266
03:00:26,579 --> 03:00:30,870
Because I don't know exactly where everyone wants to go.

2267
03:00:34,299 --> 03:00:36,299
And then remember there's a fort up here too.

2268
03:00:36,299 --> 03:00:40,700
You get the missile launch, the fort is up to the top right.

2269
03:00:40,700 --> 03:00:43,260
And then below the first super monkey is the other super monkey.

2270
03:00:43,260 --> 03:00:44,139
Understand?

2271
03:00:44,139 --> 03:00:46,540
All right, make it happen.

2272
03:00:46,540 --> 03:01:02,469
Fort?

2273
03:01:02,469 --> 03:01:03,510
All right, fort it is.

2274
03:01:05,379 --> 03:01:06,420
Fortnite.

2275
03:01:06,420 --> 03:01:09,180
There's only one thing to buy.

2276
03:01:09,180 --> 03:01:10,620
I'm going to assume that's what you guys want.

2277
03:01:11,260 --> 03:01:17,639
It is.

2278
03:01:17,639 --> 03:01:20,360
So this has increased the popping power of all the towers nearby by one.

2279
03:01:22,680 --> 03:01:24,120
1971.

2280
03:01:24,120 --> 03:01:37,670
Okay, pretty good.

2281
03:01:37,670 --> 03:01:39,510
Round 63 incoming.

2282
03:01:39,510 --> 03:01:42,409
Wait, we need new music.

2283
03:01:44,120 --> 03:01:44,840
Okay.

2284
03:01:44,840 --> 03:01:51,540
You guys need to seriously like listen up.

2285
03:01:55,739 --> 03:01:57,659
I want everybody to get up for this one.

2286
03:01:57,979 --> 03:01:59,020
I want you all to stand the fuck up.

2287
03:02:03,399 --> 03:02:04,040
Everyone get up.

2288
03:02:17,829 --> 03:02:18,790
Oh, come on.

2289
03:02:20,489 --> 03:02:21,770
Get it up for me.

2290
03:02:23,770 --> 03:02:28,200
I'll set you down.

2291
03:02:36,920 --> 03:02:38,760
I got four words for you.

2292
03:02:40,139 --> 03:02:42,860
I love this company.

2293
03:02:42,860 --> 03:02:43,360
Yeah.

2294
03:03:00,459 --> 03:03:01,100
Let's go.

2295
03:03:01,659 --> 03:03:04,860
Okay.

2296
03:03:04,860 --> 03:03:07,500
Good work.

2297
03:03:07,500 --> 03:03:08,700
64 out of 85.

2298
03:03:15,659 --> 03:03:17,260
Was that an office joke?

2299
03:03:18,790 --> 03:03:19,430
No.

2300
03:03:19,430 --> 03:04:00,379
You guys have never seen that video?

2301
03:04:00,379 --> 03:04:00,780
Come on.

2302
03:04:00,780 --> 03:04:04,100
It's like original, original meme status.

2303
03:04:04,100 --> 03:04:07,260
Come on, guys.

2304
03:04:07,260 --> 03:04:08,299
And then what?

2305
03:04:08,299 --> 03:04:18,170
I got four words for you.

2306
03:04:18,170 --> 03:04:26,760
Love this company.

2307
03:04:26,760 --> 03:04:27,719
I don't know why I did that.

2308
03:04:27,719 --> 03:04:30,120
I'm not sure what the reason to do that was, but I did it.

2309
03:04:30,120 --> 03:04:31,430
All right.

2310
03:04:31,430 --> 03:04:32,309
Where are we going?

2311
03:04:32,309 --> 03:04:36,629
That is such old shit.

2312
03:04:36,629 --> 03:04:37,110
Whatever.

2313
03:04:43,909 --> 03:04:44,870
Which one are we going to?

2314
03:04:46,889 --> 03:04:48,889
You guys are going to beat this fucking whole thing.

2315
03:04:48,889 --> 03:05:02,120
Looks like we're going right to the glue gunner.

2316
03:05:02,120 --> 03:05:03,959
This is going to take us two hours.

2317
03:05:08,250 --> 03:05:08,489
All right.

2318
03:05:08,489 --> 03:05:10,969
Glue gunner it is, but no, it's not glue gunner.

2319
03:05:10,969 --> 03:05:12,889
That can't, there's no, you can't buy anything.

2320
03:05:13,530 --> 03:05:26,120
Look, glue upgrade is, this path is closed and this one's rank 27.

2321
03:05:26,120 --> 03:05:32,629
I'm sorry, guys, but you can't do that right now.

2322
03:05:32,629 --> 03:05:37,290
Now what?

2323
03:05:37,290 --> 03:05:37,930
Nothing here?

2324
03:05:39,049 --> 03:05:44,790
The only thing that you can possibly do here in this whole area is you got either,

2325
03:05:44,790 --> 03:05:50,260
your options are wizard or super monkey.

2326
03:05:50,260 --> 03:05:52,659
You don't have enough money or enough rank to do anything else.

2327
03:05:54,549 --> 03:06:00,840
If you want wizard on this next refresh, click down here.

2328
03:06:00,840 --> 03:06:01,479
You can do both?

2329
03:06:02,120 --> 03:06:05,559
325, you can do both.

2330
03:06:05,559 --> 03:06:05,959
Okay.

2331
03:06:05,959 --> 03:06:06,440
Okay.

2332
03:06:06,440 --> 03:06:06,920
Okay.

2333
03:06:06,920 --> 03:06:07,719
Okay.

2334
03:06:07,719 --> 03:06:09,059
Okay.

2335
03:06:09,059 --> 03:06:09,459
Okay.

2336
03:06:11,540 --> 03:06:12,260
No, I get you.

2337
03:06:24,010 --> 03:06:24,809
Wizard upgrade.

2338
03:06:24,809 --> 03:06:25,290
There it is.

2339
03:06:26,729 --> 03:06:27,690
And super upgrade.

2340
03:06:27,690 --> 03:06:31,500
But do you guys actually want me to do this?

2341
03:06:31,500 --> 03:06:40,629
You want that second super monkey?

2342
03:06:40,629 --> 03:06:41,590
People are going down here.

2343
03:06:47,909 --> 03:06:50,069
Now that all the people that got their wizard upgrade,

2344
03:06:50,069 --> 03:06:51,510
they're like, no, no, no, no, no, fuck that.

2345
03:06:51,510 --> 03:06:52,790
We're doing an agent.

2346
03:06:52,790 --> 03:06:58,600
That's what happens, man.

2347
03:06:58,600 --> 03:06:58,920
Okay.

2348
03:07:01,350 --> 03:07:05,350
I have no idea what any of this shit is.

2349
03:07:05,350 --> 03:07:06,149
Turtle.

2350
03:07:06,149 --> 03:07:07,739
Bloomsday device.

2351
03:07:08,299 --> 03:07:08,620
Mirror.

2352
03:07:08,620 --> 03:07:08,860
How much?

2353
03:07:16,540 --> 03:07:17,020
Okay.

2354
03:07:17,020 --> 03:07:17,659
Close it.

2355
03:07:17,659 --> 03:07:18,540
Obviously.

2356
03:07:18,540 --> 03:07:19,500
I don't have any money.

2357
03:07:20,459 --> 03:07:21,979
I only have zero dollars.

2358
03:07:21,979 --> 03:07:28,250
You guys found the microtransactions

2359
03:07:28,250 --> 03:07:29,850
and you immediately close the window.

2360
03:07:29,850 --> 03:07:33,559
I love it.

2361
03:07:33,559 --> 03:07:34,840
And that's like, all right.

2362
03:07:34,840 --> 03:07:37,239
You know, I guess we could do the upgrade.

2363
03:07:37,239 --> 03:07:37,879
Okay.

2364
03:07:37,879 --> 03:07:38,200
Fine.

2365
03:07:38,840 --> 03:07:49,879
Round 64.

2366
03:08:00,920 --> 03:08:02,600
Is it just only going to be moabs now?

2367
03:08:03,239 --> 03:08:15,639
Cripple moab.

2368
03:08:15,639 --> 03:08:16,360
Okay.

2369
03:08:16,360 --> 03:08:23,620
That doesn't sound good.

2370
03:08:23,620 --> 03:08:28,579
Let me see the general direction that you guys want to go on this one.

2371
03:08:28,579 --> 03:08:29,219
Let's put on...

2372
03:08:29,860 --> 03:08:32,659
Where's the music?

2373
03:08:33,540 --> 03:08:34,100
I'm going.

2374
03:08:34,100 --> 03:08:40,440
I'm working on it.

2375
03:08:40,440 --> 03:08:41,000
Spore?

2376
03:08:43,110 --> 03:08:44,149
Spyro?

2377
03:08:44,149 --> 03:08:46,940
Katamari?

2378
03:08:46,940 --> 03:08:47,180
I don't know.

2379
03:08:47,180 --> 03:08:51,000
I'm going to play that, by the way.

2380
03:08:51,000 --> 03:08:53,719
Let's get a sneak peek of Katamari Damacy

2381
03:08:53,719 --> 03:08:55,879
because I'm definitely going to play the remade one.

2382
03:09:03,159 --> 03:09:05,639
This has one of the best soundtracks of any video game ever.

2383
03:09:06,360 --> 03:09:11,530
All right.

2384
03:09:11,530 --> 03:09:12,329
Where are we going?

2385
03:09:12,329 --> 03:09:12,729
Over here.

2386
03:09:12,729 --> 03:09:13,930
Right into the...

2387
03:09:13,930 --> 03:09:14,969
We don't have enough money for this.

2388
03:09:16,600 --> 03:09:17,639
Sniper can't be upgraded.

2389
03:09:19,510 --> 03:09:20,870
This can't be upgraded.

2390
03:09:20,870 --> 03:09:22,469
None of this over here can be upgraded, guys.

2391
03:09:24,819 --> 03:09:26,020
You don't have very many choices.

2392
03:09:32,600 --> 03:09:37,819
Your only option to upgrade anything is down the bottom here to the boomerang.

2393
03:09:40,440 --> 03:09:43,299
So try again.

2394
03:09:43,860 --> 03:09:54,379
Here we go.

2395
03:09:58,250 --> 03:09:58,889
65.

2396
03:10:09,270 --> 03:10:11,110
Do not sell the boomerang.

2397
03:10:11,110 --> 03:10:12,629
It's not my decision to make.

2398
03:10:12,629 --> 03:10:13,030
Sorry.

2399
03:10:13,590 --> 03:10:27,540
This is the best song of the whole album.

2400
03:10:28,100 --> 03:10:29,799
This is the best one.

2401
03:11:33,690 --> 03:11:34,090
Did it.

2402
03:11:34,090 --> 03:11:37,540
66 out of 85.

2403
03:11:37,540 --> 03:11:38,659
I am impressed.

2404
03:11:48,680 --> 03:11:54,920
Oh, boy.

2405
03:11:54,920 --> 03:11:55,159
All right.

2406
03:11:55,159 --> 03:11:55,559
We got...

2407
03:12:00,250 --> 03:12:06,870
It's either these people wanting the super monkey upgrade plasma or jungle drums.

2408
03:12:07,670 --> 03:12:09,750
I'm gonna...

2409
03:12:09,750 --> 03:12:11,590
Sorry, all those of you that want to go over here.

2410
03:12:11,590 --> 03:12:13,829
I'm sorry about that, but it's all split over here.

2411
03:12:15,530 --> 03:12:15,930
All right.

2412
03:12:15,930 --> 03:12:18,409
If you want super monkey, put your vote down here.

2413
03:12:19,930 --> 03:12:21,690
Everyone else, do what you were doing before.

2414
03:12:23,290 --> 03:12:25,290
Good luck.

2415
03:12:37,430 --> 03:12:40,709
Looks like we're doing the village.

2416
03:12:49,020 --> 03:12:49,420
All right.

2417
03:12:50,860 --> 03:12:53,459
That's the only up here to do.

2418
03:12:53,459 --> 03:12:54,340
Jungle drums.

2419
03:12:54,340 --> 03:12:56,020
Inspire neighbor Tauzu to attack faster.

2420
03:13:03,399 --> 03:13:03,639
And...

2421
03:13:07,750 --> 03:13:08,389
Oh, shit.

2422
03:13:10,469 --> 03:13:11,270
This is...

2423
03:13:11,270 --> 03:13:11,909
Whoa.

2424
03:13:11,909 --> 03:13:12,629
Hold on here.

2425
03:13:18,280 --> 03:13:18,760
This is...

2426
03:13:20,309 --> 03:13:21,750
I think people want another tower.

2427
03:13:27,059 --> 03:13:27,459
Is that...

2428
03:13:33,399 --> 03:13:34,200
All right.

2429
03:13:35,159 --> 03:13:36,120
Another tower coming up.

2430
03:13:40,180 --> 03:13:43,860
Remember, if you want to scroll down, you got to go over here.

2431
03:13:55,530 --> 03:13:56,090
Holy shit.

2432
03:13:56,090 --> 03:13:57,370
Okay, we're going down.

2433
03:14:01,159 --> 03:14:03,239
So what do you guys want here?

2434
03:14:03,239 --> 03:14:04,760
I need like two screenshots.

2435
03:14:06,700 --> 03:14:07,500
All right.

2436
03:14:07,500 --> 03:14:11,530
If you want monkey village, go over here.

2437
03:14:12,870 --> 03:14:14,389
Monkey village, click up here.

2438
03:14:17,049 --> 03:14:18,969
A banana farm, up here.

2439
03:14:20,899 --> 03:14:22,579
Water tower, down here.

2440
03:14:26,629 --> 03:14:28,069
Dartling gunner, down here.

2441
03:14:28,889 --> 03:14:31,620
And if you want this, then go up here.

2442
03:14:31,620 --> 03:14:32,819
Like actually just put it here.

2443
03:14:35,780 --> 03:14:37,700
So again, just think of it in the corners, right?

2444
03:14:37,700 --> 03:14:38,739
Monkey village, up here.

2445
03:14:39,540 --> 03:14:41,000
Banana farm, up here.

2446
03:14:41,959 --> 03:14:42,840
Water tower, down here.

2447
03:14:44,700 --> 03:14:45,739
Gatling gun, down here.

2448
03:14:46,540 --> 03:14:48,379
And if you want the spike factory, here.

2449
03:14:51,850 --> 03:14:52,809
One, two, three.

2450
03:14:59,479 --> 03:14:59,959
Holy fuck.

2451
03:14:59,959 --> 03:15:01,159
You guys want a spike factory?

2452
03:15:02,569 --> 03:15:03,690
Nobody wants anything else.

2453
03:15:04,250 --> 03:15:07,500
I have 75 IQ.

2454
03:15:07,500 --> 03:15:09,020
These instructions are confusing me.

2455
03:15:11,750 --> 03:15:12,069
All right.

2456
03:15:12,069 --> 03:15:14,629
Looks like we're doing dart spike factory.

2457
03:15:20,680 --> 03:15:21,799
Spike factory it is.

2458
03:15:21,799 --> 03:15:23,639
And where the hell is this even going to go?

2459
03:15:31,299 --> 03:15:31,780
Over here.

2460
03:15:35,579 --> 03:15:37,579
66 of 85, coming up.

2461
03:15:41,479 --> 03:15:42,680
Looks like it's going right here.

2462
03:15:48,360 --> 03:15:49,159
Okay.

2463
03:15:49,159 --> 03:15:54,500
I don't think you have any money for anything else.

2464
03:16:00,309 --> 03:16:00,790
Maybe not.

2465
03:16:00,790 --> 03:16:01,190
Who knows?

2466
03:16:09,370 --> 03:16:09,690
No?

2467
03:16:09,690 --> 03:16:10,170
You ready?

2468
03:16:10,170 --> 03:16:10,969
Okay.

2469
03:16:10,969 --> 03:16:11,850
Pick up 66.

2470
03:16:12,649 --> 03:16:19,219
$2,700.

2471
03:16:20,100 --> 03:16:35,819
You guys really are such gamers.

2472
03:16:35,819 --> 03:16:36,620
I'm shocked.

2473
03:16:42,940 --> 03:16:44,299
Cluster bomb tower, level up.

2474
03:16:44,299 --> 03:16:47,190
67 of 85, you're very close.

2475
03:16:47,909 --> 03:16:48,629
Less than 20.

2476
03:16:56,739 --> 03:16:58,340
Now, some of you want to go,

2477
03:16:58,340 --> 03:16:59,379
and some of you want to upgrade.

2478
03:17:02,059 --> 03:17:07,020
Very conflicted in here of what to upgrade.

2479
03:17:07,020 --> 03:17:10,309
Then I hate to burst everybody's bubble over here,

2480
03:17:10,309 --> 03:17:24,940
but can't afford anything.

2481
03:17:24,940 --> 03:17:31,030
Here we go.

2482
03:17:31,030 --> 03:17:49,190
67, almost at 69.

2483
03:17:49,190 --> 03:17:50,149
Oh, I see what you mean.

2484
03:17:50,149 --> 03:17:50,389
Okay.

2485
03:17:50,389 --> 03:17:51,190
Never mind.

2486
03:17:51,190 --> 03:18:08,729
Attacks super duper fast.

2487
03:18:08,729 --> 03:18:10,010
And super monkey level up.

2488
03:18:10,010 --> 03:18:12,469
Robo monkey.

2489
03:18:12,469 --> 03:18:13,750
Radar scanner.

2490
03:18:13,750 --> 03:18:16,950
These are upgrades that I don't think even half of the people

2491
03:18:16,950 --> 03:18:18,870
that have played this game have ever seen.

2492
03:18:18,870 --> 03:18:24,229
4,800 bucks.

2493
03:18:24,229 --> 03:18:31,420
Should have enough to do a couple things here.

2494
03:18:33,850 --> 03:18:36,170
82% look like they want to go up here.

2495
03:18:36,809 --> 03:18:39,219
That's a large number up here.

2496
03:18:45,559 --> 03:18:48,569
Excuse me, Vessel, please increase volume.

2497
03:18:48,569 --> 03:18:49,370
Increasing volume.

2498
03:18:50,389 --> 03:18:50,870
Job done.

2499
03:18:54,100 --> 03:18:54,340
Okay.

2500
03:18:59,180 --> 03:18:59,819
Yeah.

2501
03:18:59,819 --> 03:19:00,860
Getting the radar.

2502
03:19:00,860 --> 03:19:02,700
Radar scanner allows all towers in this radius

2503
03:19:02,700 --> 03:19:04,700
to be able to detect and target camo bloons.

2504
03:19:05,739 --> 03:19:06,459
Let's hope it's worth it.

2505
03:19:15,290 --> 03:19:15,930
68.

2506
03:19:24,899 --> 03:19:27,299
Oh, big boy, big boy, big boy, big boy, big boy.

2507
03:19:31,879 --> 03:19:34,219
That was nothing.

2508
03:19:34,219 --> 03:19:34,780
69.

2509
03:19:35,340 --> 03:19:38,950
What's the deal?

2510
03:19:45,989 --> 03:19:47,510
Uh, cannon?

2511
03:19:50,180 --> 03:19:51,459
50-50 on the cannon here.

2512
03:19:57,909 --> 03:19:58,389
All right.

2513
03:19:58,389 --> 03:19:59,430
Looks like we're doing the cannon.

2514
03:20:04,659 --> 03:20:06,500
Yeah, that's what people want.

2515
03:20:06,500 --> 03:20:08,020
Attacks super duper fast.

2516
03:20:15,100 --> 03:20:16,620
Excuse me, Vessel, what round are we on?

2517
03:20:16,620 --> 03:20:19,819
We are on round number 69.

2518
03:20:20,540 --> 03:20:32,260
He said it.

2519
03:20:32,260 --> 03:20:34,500
I said the number 69.

2520
03:20:35,219 --> 03:20:35,940
Come on now.

2521
03:20:35,940 --> 03:20:36,840
What the hell is this?

2522
03:20:39,610 --> 03:20:41,290
You're at the final 15, chat.

2523
03:20:41,930 --> 03:20:44,329
Final 15 of Bloons.

2524
03:20:44,969 --> 03:20:48,010
Super hard tower defense map number three in the list.

2525
03:20:52,969 --> 03:20:54,329
Tack shooter upgrade tier four.

2526
03:20:54,329 --> 03:20:55,049
Ring of fire.

2527
03:20:58,569 --> 03:21:00,010
All of the towers have been unlocked.

2528
03:21:00,729 --> 03:21:01,290
You guys are in...

2529
03:21:01,290 --> 03:21:02,090
This is the end game.

2530
03:21:04,329 --> 03:21:05,930
Peter, Peter.

2531
03:21:05,930 --> 03:21:07,129
We're at the end game now, Peter.

2532
03:21:19,530 --> 03:21:21,209
I am actually very, very interested

2533
03:21:22,229 --> 03:21:25,270
in how you guys handle the last 10 rounds.

2534
03:21:27,139 --> 03:21:28,739
There's gonna be a lot of in-fighting.

2535
03:21:31,350 --> 03:21:31,909
New tower.

2536
03:21:35,959 --> 03:21:36,459
Okay.

2537
03:21:42,069 --> 03:21:43,350
Remember, if you want me to go down,

2538
03:21:44,149 --> 03:21:45,959
you know where to click.

2539
03:21:52,020 --> 03:21:52,260
All right.

2540
03:21:52,260 --> 03:21:55,620
For this one, I actually can't say them.

2541
03:21:55,620 --> 03:22:01,049
Tax.

2542
03:22:01,049 --> 03:22:01,290
All right.

2543
03:22:01,290 --> 03:22:02,649
So here's what's gonna happen with this, okay?

2544
03:22:03,290 --> 03:22:04,170
You want me to go down.

2545
03:22:04,170 --> 03:22:05,129
I'm gonna scroll this down.

2546
03:22:06,360 --> 03:22:10,760
But just pretend that this is here.

2547
03:22:12,149 --> 03:22:12,629
You know what I mean?

2548
03:22:13,270 --> 03:22:14,629
Replace all these icons

2549
03:22:14,629 --> 03:22:15,989
with the ones that are in front of you right now.

2550
03:22:21,030 --> 03:22:22,549
So with that being said,

2551
03:22:22,549 --> 03:22:23,829
imagine that it's all scrolled down.

2552
03:22:24,469 --> 03:22:26,149
Just replace the icons on the right

2553
03:22:26,149 --> 03:22:27,510
with the ones that are in the middle.

2554
03:22:27,510 --> 03:22:27,989
Good luck.

2555
03:22:28,549 --> 03:22:38,139
So this is monkey sub.

2556
03:22:38,780 --> 03:22:39,659
It's this one.

2557
03:22:39,659 --> 03:22:50,340
Some of you guys are helping.

2558
03:22:50,340 --> 03:22:50,739
It's great.

2559
03:22:50,739 --> 03:22:51,139
This one.

2560
03:22:51,139 --> 03:22:55,299
Remember, it's this one.

2561
03:22:55,299 --> 03:22:56,020
Okay.

2562
03:22:56,020 --> 03:23:02,540
Monkey's up.

2563
03:23:02,540 --> 03:23:03,100
What do you want it?

2564
03:23:15,290 --> 03:23:15,850
Over here.

2565
03:23:16,489 --> 03:23:17,209
Over here.

2566
03:23:18,489 --> 03:23:22,280
We just need the king of the cosmos

2567
03:23:22,280 --> 03:23:24,120
doing his record scratch talking.

2568
03:23:32,260 --> 03:23:34,020
This is as close as I can get it right here.

2569
03:23:34,739 --> 03:23:36,540
That's right in the middle.

2570
03:23:37,739 --> 03:23:38,700
It can't go on land.

2571
03:23:38,700 --> 03:23:39,579
So it can't go over here.

2572
03:23:39,579 --> 03:23:40,379
It has to go either.

2573
03:23:40,379 --> 03:23:41,659
No, it can't even go over here.

2574
03:23:41,659 --> 03:23:45,829
It has to go here or here.

2575
03:23:45,829 --> 03:23:49,510
Reset it.

2576
03:24:01,370 --> 03:24:03,899
What's going on up here?

2577
03:24:03,899 --> 03:24:05,100
I can't fit it there.

2578
03:24:05,100 --> 03:24:06,299
It's got to be right here.

2579
03:24:06,299 --> 03:24:12,219
The one little spot which is right here.

2580
03:24:12,219 --> 03:24:20,389
This is the only spot it can go.

2581
03:24:20,389 --> 03:24:25,610
I'm putting it down.

2582
03:24:25,610 --> 03:24:27,129
I'm putting it down.

2583
03:24:27,129 --> 03:24:27,850
I'm putting it down.

2584
03:24:33,030 --> 03:24:33,909
God damn it.

2585
03:24:33,909 --> 03:24:39,180
Hold on.

2586
03:24:39,180 --> 03:24:41,020
It's too close.

2587
03:24:41,020 --> 03:24:43,819
Too close to call here.

2588
03:24:43,819 --> 03:24:59,559
Show me.

2589
03:24:59,559 --> 03:25:00,360
All right.

2590
03:25:00,360 --> 03:25:01,079
Right down there.

2591
03:25:01,079 --> 03:25:01,799
You got it.

2592
03:25:01,799 --> 03:25:09,159
It's been placed.

2593
03:25:09,159 --> 03:25:23,450
Thanks for the clarification.

2594
03:25:23,450 --> 03:25:23,770
More.

2595
03:25:23,770 --> 03:25:24,889
What else can we do?

2596
03:25:24,889 --> 03:25:35,180
Can't do anything else.

2597
03:25:35,180 --> 03:25:36,440
All right.

2598
03:25:36,440 --> 03:25:37,159
Final 15.

2599
03:25:37,159 --> 03:25:38,040
Good luck.

2600
03:25:38,040 --> 03:25:59,270
Speed it up.

2601
03:26:01,030 --> 03:26:03,670
I don't even need to see this bullshit.

2602
03:26:03,670 --> 03:26:04,790
This easy mode.

2603
03:26:10,569 --> 03:26:12,649
Super Monkey Fan Club.

2604
03:26:12,649 --> 03:26:15,909
Converts up to 10 nearby dart monkeys into super monkeys.

2605
03:26:15,909 --> 03:26:17,590
If it's an ability, I can't click them.

2606
03:26:18,229 --> 03:26:19,879
Balloon Liquifier.

2607
03:26:19,879 --> 03:26:20,680
Summon Whirlwind.

2608
03:26:22,940 --> 03:26:23,500
71.

2609
03:26:33,860 --> 03:26:34,500
Wizard, huh?

2610
03:26:38,180 --> 03:26:39,459
So many people saw a tornado

2611
03:26:39,459 --> 03:26:40,420
and they're just like,

2612
03:26:40,420 --> 03:26:41,700
give us the tornado.

2613
03:26:44,379 --> 03:26:45,100
You got it.

2614
03:26:45,100 --> 03:26:45,819
Tornado it is.

2615
03:26:46,379 --> 03:26:53,260
Anything else?

2616
03:26:53,819 --> 03:26:57,610
No, I can't do this.

2617
03:26:57,610 --> 03:26:59,049
I don't have the money to do this.

2618
03:26:59,049 --> 03:27:01,370
I don't have the real money currency income thing.

2619
03:27:08,809 --> 03:27:10,250
Bing, bing, bing, bing.

2620
03:27:10,250 --> 03:27:11,370
Lighten up the whole map here.

2621
03:27:11,930 --> 03:27:15,659
Let's go.

2622
03:27:16,219 --> 03:27:26,920
It's a small delay vessel.

2623
03:27:34,809 --> 03:27:36,409
Large piles of spikes per shot.

2624
03:27:37,049 --> 03:27:38,760
72.85.

2625
03:27:38,760 --> 03:27:39,479
Almost in the top 10.

2626
03:27:49,639 --> 03:27:52,120
Vessel music change to Hotline Miami please.

2627
03:27:55,079 --> 03:27:55,559
Sure thing.

2628
03:28:07,340 --> 03:28:09,819
And it seems that we're going to be upgrading the

2629
03:28:10,780 --> 03:28:12,299
spike generator.

2630
03:28:12,299 --> 03:28:12,940
Bigger stacks.

2631
03:28:12,940 --> 03:28:14,620
Generates larger piles of spikes per shot.

2632
03:28:18,280 --> 03:28:20,739
In one, two.

2633
03:28:21,379 --> 03:28:27,579
Okay, 72.

2634
03:28:28,139 --> 03:28:29,180
Wait, hold on.

2635
03:28:29,180 --> 03:28:29,739
No, hold on.

2636
03:28:29,739 --> 03:28:31,020
Just wait a second.

2637
03:28:31,020 --> 03:28:41,540
Okay, let's go to...

2638
03:28:42,979 --> 03:28:43,379
Let's go.

2639
03:28:47,690 --> 03:28:48,250
End game.

2640
03:28:48,250 --> 03:28:50,010
I did not think you guys were going to make it this far.

2641
03:28:51,049 --> 03:28:56,969
I would be visibly impressed

2642
03:28:56,969 --> 03:28:59,129
if you guys actually beat this whole thing on hard.

2643
03:28:59,930 --> 03:29:16,579
All right.

2644
03:29:16,579 --> 03:29:21,370
There's actually quite a few options at the moment.

2645
03:29:21,370 --> 03:29:32,729
He thinks we're incompetent?

2646
03:29:32,729 --> 03:29:33,770
No, I didn't say that.

2647
03:29:33,770 --> 03:29:34,809
I just didn't think this was going to be...

2648
03:29:35,530 --> 03:29:41,290
All of chat is doing this together.

2649
03:29:41,290 --> 03:29:42,329
Absolutely remarkable.

2650
03:29:42,329 --> 03:29:43,770
So you guys want to do plasma.

2651
03:29:45,690 --> 03:29:47,129
Vessel please skip one song.

2652
03:29:49,239 --> 03:29:54,840
Skipping ahead seven minutes.

2653
03:29:54,840 --> 03:29:55,159
All right.

2654
03:29:55,159 --> 03:29:55,559
There it is.

2655
03:29:55,559 --> 03:29:55,959
Plasma.

2656
03:29:59,530 --> 03:30:14,280
No more money.

2657
03:30:14,280 --> 03:30:15,319
Smoothening out here.

2658
03:30:28,379 --> 03:30:28,940
Jesus.

2659
03:30:29,670 --> 03:30:31,190
This is not even hard now.

2660
03:30:31,750 --> 03:30:37,879
You guys have done too good of a job.

2661
03:30:37,879 --> 03:30:39,399
And everybody just wants to go.

2662
03:30:39,399 --> 03:30:41,690
Let's go.

2663
03:30:41,690 --> 03:30:42,090
Fuck it.

2664
03:30:42,090 --> 03:31:04,979
Let's go.

2665
03:31:04,979 --> 03:31:08,969
Final 10 rounds coming up.

2666
03:31:08,969 --> 03:31:12,809
Can you guys beat the Galaxy level on hard?

2667
03:31:23,909 --> 03:31:24,790
Unbelievable.

2668
03:31:24,790 --> 03:31:27,590
Again, they say.

2669
03:31:27,590 --> 03:31:27,829
Again.

2670
03:31:27,829 --> 03:31:28,950
Do it again, they say.

2671
03:31:30,540 --> 03:31:30,940
Again.

2672
03:31:31,860 --> 03:31:32,180
Again.

2673
03:31:35,930 --> 03:31:45,110
Again.

2674
03:31:45,110 --> 03:31:46,149
75.

2675
03:31:46,149 --> 03:32:09,739
Nobody can even match your strength.

2676
03:32:09,739 --> 03:32:10,379
Holy shit.

2677
03:32:10,379 --> 03:32:10,700
Again.

2678
03:32:11,659 --> 03:32:12,059
You sure?

2679
03:32:12,059 --> 03:32:13,100
But we're in the top 10 here.

2680
03:32:13,100 --> 03:32:14,540
You sure that's not a mistake?

2681
03:32:23,030 --> 03:32:25,989
People are starting to feel a little bit of the heat here.

2682
03:32:32,870 --> 03:32:33,590
It's climbing.

2683
03:32:33,590 --> 03:32:34,069
All right.

2684
03:32:34,069 --> 03:32:34,569
Okay.

2685
03:32:37,379 --> 03:32:39,219
That's the sniper you're looking at there.

2686
03:32:39,219 --> 03:32:40,579
So which upgrade do you want for the sniper?

2687
03:32:41,139 --> 03:32:55,239
Semi-automatic or 5-0?

2688
03:33:05,799 --> 03:33:10,069
Look at the percentage of just...

2689
03:33:10,069 --> 03:33:10,389
No!

2690
03:33:10,389 --> 03:33:10,790
Go!

2691
03:33:10,790 --> 03:33:11,430
Save money!

2692
03:33:12,309 --> 03:33:13,190
Got to listen.

2693
03:33:13,909 --> 03:33:15,879
Okay.

2694
03:33:18,409 --> 03:33:19,770
Down to 5200 bucks.

2695
03:33:20,489 --> 03:33:31,219
Again, deadly precision, extreme accuracy, and muzzle velocity

2696
03:33:31,219 --> 03:33:34,739
cause up to 18 layers of bloons to be popped.

2697
03:33:34,739 --> 03:33:45,340
All right.

2698
03:33:45,340 --> 03:33:49,030
Well, here we go.

2699
03:33:49,030 --> 03:33:54,340
That's out of reach at this point.

2700
03:33:54,340 --> 03:34:04,520
Where to now?

2701
03:34:04,520 --> 03:34:09,350
All right.

2702
03:34:09,350 --> 03:34:13,590
You guys are ready.

2703
03:34:13,590 --> 03:34:14,709
Let the games begin.

2704
03:34:22,149 --> 03:34:23,110
That was five seconds.

2705
03:34:27,059 --> 03:34:28,020
77 of 85.

2706
03:34:28,659 --> 03:34:39,819
Again, be careful.

2707
03:34:40,540 --> 03:34:43,340
Wasn't there a video game that came out with the narrator that had a low voice

2708
03:34:43,340 --> 03:34:44,940
and there was a party of four people

2709
03:34:44,940 --> 03:34:47,340
and they went and they trekked through dangerous dungeons

2710
03:34:48,299 --> 03:34:49,780
and there was a big warning.

2711
03:34:49,780 --> 03:34:53,139
They were bowed over confidence being a very slow, slow bleed.

2712
03:34:53,700 --> 03:34:55,379
Be careful here.

2713
03:35:03,110 --> 03:35:03,610
Uh-oh!

2714
03:35:04,309 --> 03:35:05,190
Is this the end?

2715
03:35:05,829 --> 03:35:06,790
Could this be the end?

2716
03:35:08,790 --> 03:35:09,430
No, no, no.

2717
03:35:09,430 --> 03:35:11,030
That was a little shaky there.

2718
03:35:17,100 --> 03:35:17,819
Oh, fuck.

2719
03:35:18,379 --> 03:35:18,860
Uh-oh.

2720
03:35:18,860 --> 03:35:19,360
Uh-oh.

2721
03:35:19,979 --> 03:35:21,899
This is the first time we've seen it go around that far.

2722
03:35:26,280 --> 03:35:27,239
Uh, Monkey Town.

2723
03:35:29,190 --> 03:35:30,870
Faster Production Spike Factory.

2724
03:35:32,139 --> 03:35:34,139
And, uh, Sniper Monkey Tier 4.

2725
03:35:37,319 --> 03:35:38,440
78 of 85.

2726
03:35:38,440 --> 03:35:39,079
What are you gonna do?

2727
03:35:44,469 --> 03:35:44,969
Hmm.

2728
03:35:51,540 --> 03:35:52,579
And just like that.

2729
03:35:57,799 --> 03:35:58,760
Oh, boy.

2730
03:35:58,760 --> 03:35:59,799
The indecision here.

2731
03:36:03,159 --> 03:36:04,920
Well, it looks like it's this one.

2732
03:36:05,639 --> 03:36:06,360
Nope.

2733
03:36:06,360 --> 03:36:07,000
It's this one.

2734
03:36:12,469 --> 03:36:12,790
Yep.

2735
03:36:13,430 --> 03:36:19,450
Please select which one it is.

2736
03:36:19,450 --> 03:36:20,170

hey jerma following up on a recent question uh what games you got obsessed with has there

2972
04:29:46,229 --> 04:29:50,870
ever been a game that you loved and even though you knew it was a bad game much love from Austria

2973
04:29:50,870 --> 04:29:59,079
thanks again for being amazing thank you wild fox one look at look at stream look at whoa

2974
04:30:01,350 --> 04:30:09,930
holy shit that's clean that's very clean wow but here's the real question can you get an

2975
04:30:09,930 --> 04:30:25,079
even percent can you get an even percentage on every single one of those good luck a game

2976
04:30:25,079 --> 04:30:36,309
that I thought was bad that I got obsessed with um no I don't I don't think so a game

2977
04:30:36,309 --> 04:30:47,430
that I knew was bad but I was I mean maybe I don't know Diablo 3 does that count but that counts

2978
04:30:47,430 --> 04:30:54,579
right because there was a point where I just like hated Diablo 3 and like the position that it was

2979
04:30:54,579 --> 04:30:59,139
in especially like a couple months after launch I thought it was like oh wow this is really

2980
04:30:59,139 --> 04:31:05,459
cool the initial six hours of Diablo 3 I mean the initial like 10 hours or 15 hours was

2981
04:31:05,459 --> 04:31:11,610
like oh this is oh cool cool this is actually kind of fun and then after like I put 50 to

2982
04:31:11,610 --> 04:31:16,889
100 hours into the game after like two months three months of the game being live I hated it

2983
04:31:20,360 --> 04:31:25,239
and that was in the middle of the real money auction house the game was a fucking mess

2984
04:31:28,139 --> 04:31:36,340
no close you guys have you had six percent on the m what's going on there but no what the

2985
04:31:36,340 --> 04:31:43,049
exp the the Diablo 3 expansion uh yeah I gave up on it for a while and then Reaper of Souls

2986
04:31:43,049 --> 04:31:48,280
came out made the game 10,000 times better and then the game I don't think the game at

2987
04:31:48,280 --> 04:31:53,399
this point they've just kind of been tacking on so much shit on top of everything that's already

2988
04:31:53,399 --> 04:32:01,500
there that it's just kind of very there's rift rift rift rift rift rift that's really all there

2989
04:32:01,500 --> 04:32:07,959
is in the game at this point now and for me at least but if that answers your question I

2990
04:32:07,959 --> 04:32:14,500
hope so but I did get a lot of play time in Diablo 3 hey thank you uh queso for the one

2997
04:33:02,520 --> 04:33:11,180

2998
04:33:11,180 --> 04:33:24,840
up in a way where that's possible um I'd need to be careful with that one that's interesting

3066
04:42:52,340 --> 04:42:54,580
what's up I was thinking to me and a few others we're actually already talking about

3067
04:42:54,580 --> 04:43:00,340
it in the discord a germa discord smash ultimate tournament would be really fun there

3068
04:43:00,340 --> 04:43:04,979
are a bunch of sites to organize it too we're gonna do one regardless probably are you interested

3069
04:43:08,259 --> 04:43:13,450
uh for stream I don't I don't know I'm not sure if I'm even gonna stream smash brothers I've been

3070
04:43:13,450 --> 04:43:19,459
fighting against it for like I was gonna stream it today but I feel like it's just one of

3071
04:43:19,459 --> 04:43:36,900
those games that's hard to stream everyone is streaming smash I know and I know I know I know

3072
04:43:36,900 --> 04:43:42,709
hard to stream well it's let me put it this way there are games that I like to play on

3073
04:43:42,709 --> 04:43:47,349
stream because I think that a lot of people can enjoy them there are games that I don't like to

3074
04:43:47,349 --> 04:43:51,270
put on stream because I feel like I'm the only one that can enjoy them does that make sense

3075
04:43:51,990 --> 04:44:11,419
sort of because like I'll play through the world of light okay I'm having a great time

3076
04:44:11,419 --> 04:44:18,020
collecting stickers and it can be interesting some of those encounters are have been really

3077
04:44:18,020 --> 04:44:21,700
really interesting and I'm not against streaming a game and playing a game just because

3078
04:44:22,580 --> 04:44:30,020
you know I don't really have any rules for myself on this channel it's just what do I

3079
04:44:30,020 --> 04:44:33,299
feel like doing do I think I can have fun doing it and then do I feel like doing it

3080
04:44:33,299 --> 04:44:37,459
that's been the MO for this channel for like the last three years I mean for instance I'm

3081
04:44:37,459 --> 04:44:41,860
building a bird house probably in like the next couple days I've got building a fucking bird

3082
04:44:41,860 --> 04:44:49,220
house on stream like I what why the fuck do I want to do that one guy said you should build

3083
04:44:49,220 --> 04:44:55,340
stuff build a bird house build this and I'm like okay like that sounds fucking cool am I

3084
04:44:55,340 --> 04:45:04,919
gonna paint it oh you better believe it why did I spoil that well that's all right it's

3085
04:45:04,919 --> 04:45:19,060
not a spoiler you don't know what I'm gonna make but that's my mentality going into streams are

3086
04:45:19,060 --> 04:45:25,299
always what do I feel like doing and do I think it's gonna be fun it's not oh I want to play

3087
04:45:25,299 --> 04:45:31,700
this game or I want to let me do this as like a series no it every single stream except

3088
04:45:31,700 --> 04:45:39,529
obviously the ones that have to be planned months in advance or weeks in advance but

3089
04:45:39,529 --> 04:45:42,810
I don't really have a rhyme or reason to it besides the ones that have a lot of planning

3090
04:45:45,180 --> 04:45:48,540
the game and activity doesn't matter that much if you haven't fun the stream is fun

3091
04:45:49,099 --> 04:46:01,240
yeah that's true that is the mentality who is the fabled one guy uh sberg thanks with three

3261
05:09:48,330 --> 05:09:51,049
just wondering how many subs you have now if you're not comfortable giving a number that's

3262
05:09:51,049 --> 05:09:57,209
cool no i i've told you guys before that there's a fucking insane amount of people here now

3263
05:09:58,970 --> 05:10:06,340
it's not it's not a secret over the last i'll give you some real numbers here that's just

3264
05:10:06,340 --> 05:10:17,669
fucking insane over the last six months this channel has in six months not even six four

3265
05:10:17,669 --> 05:10:24,709
not even six months like five months received over three thousand subs in the last not even

3266
05:10:24,709 --> 05:10:33,380
half a year and that was on top of what i had before that's fucking insane and especially

3267
05:10:35,110 --> 05:10:43,220
you know that means we're over 5k there are more than five thousand fucking subs on this

3268
05:10:43,220 --> 05:11:02,439
channel and a bunch of these happened in the last like 45 days it jumped up like fucking crazy

3269
05:11:03,830 --> 05:11:11,639
i think since moving to since moving to vegas there i think has been more than two and a

3270
05:11:11,639 --> 05:11:25,349
half to three thousand subs maybe even just since moving it's been an insane amount i did

3271
05:11:25,349 --> 05:11:31,500
a hundred of them last stream yeah i'm not i'm not even counting those so you guys see how

3272
05:11:33,259 --> 05:11:38,220
you know it affects me it does i i want this channel to be fun i want you to care i want

3273
05:11:38,220 --> 05:11:41,099
you to think it's worth paying for and if there are over five thousand fucking people

3274
05:11:41,099 --> 05:11:48,009
paying this stream every month i want this shit i want you to be fucking happy being here

3275
05:11:48,009 --> 05:11:53,860
i want you to have fucking fun and if i get that kind of fucking money i'm gonna i'm gonna

3276
05:11:53,860 --> 05:12:06,139
fucking do that shit i'm gonna try as hard as i can he's gonna cry no i'm not gonna cry

3277
05:12:13,299 --> 05:12:18,659
but this channel even in viewers not just subscriptions or bits or just take a look at

3278
05:12:18,659 --> 05:12:23,959
the view numbers that have happened over the last like two or three months the channel

3279
05:12:23,959 --> 05:12:31,479
has almost doubled in size in three months almost sometimes it potentially tripled in size

3280
05:12:32,119 --> 05:12:49,819
so but that i i don't want that to change the way that i do things i don't want

3281
05:12:50,979 --> 05:12:56,740
uh oh yeah you got 12 000 concurrent viewers a few days ago whatever it was like the last

3282
05:12:56,740 --> 05:13:02,919
week oh yeah you know you get 5 000 fucking subs on your channel i don't want to change

3283
05:13:02,919 --> 05:13:13,830
the shit that i like how i approach things if they were if they were 11 000 people here

3284
05:13:13,830 --> 05:13:21,209
versus 500 i'm gonna approach the streams the same exact way and now if there's more people

3285
05:13:21,209 --> 05:13:26,939
and there's more money coming in just get to i'm just gonna do other shit i'm gonna try to do

3286
05:13:26,939 --> 05:13:43,669
more stuff remember the hitman1 message you recorded for us yeah i yes i do i remember

3287
05:13:43,669 --> 05:13:49,750
that night very very vividly hundreds and hundreds of dollars came in that night and

3288
05:13:49,750 --> 05:13:55,720
that was one of the first times i'd ever had like six seven eight thousand fifteen

3289
05:13:55,720 --> 05:14:14,360
hundred dollars given in one stream but that's gonna be the end of tonight i'm probably i don't

3290
05:14:14,360 --> 05:14:20,200
i think at this point because it's getting very late i might take tomorrow off and come back on
