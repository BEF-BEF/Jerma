1
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:39,289
What's up? How's it going? What's happening? I'm at the beach right now. Oh, that sounds actually kind of fun.

2
00:00:41,030 --> 00:01:02,649
At the beach? I'm at the North Pole. What? Where are you guys? No, good to see you. Today we're going to play

3
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:10,420
Halls of Torment. It's a vampire survivor's lake. I've had my eye on it for a little while and

4
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:16,900
unfortunately I'm playing this game one day too early because I believe the beta launches

5
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,700
in like a day or two. So that's my fault. I'm playing it literally like 24 hours too early,

6
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:37,689
but that's too bad because I want to play it bad. So even if it beta comes out the next day or two,

7
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:49,829
whatever, it looks really fun. I'm a huge vampire survivors fan. I'm going to play it. I'm ready.

8
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:58,120
I'm here for five minutes to laugh at how lame this is. All right, we'll see you later.

9
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:14,310
Thanks for stopping by. Bye. Okay. Anyways, let's go. I'm fresh save file. Hey, can you wait?

10
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:23,129
My boyfriend's in the bathroom. Yeah. What do you think? Like another 100 or two? Two minutes?

11
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:37,620
It's, yeah, it's a fresh save file. I love these games with a fresh save file because I'm going to

12
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:44,580
be terrible. I'm going to have no items. I'm going to be dog shit at the game. I love it. I can't wait.

13
00:02:46,219 --> 00:03:00,139
What about Hilux too? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Your dog shit at all games.

14
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:08,199
Clearly think you forgot about the, the one to two headshots in a row. I got with the Huntsman last

15
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:18,949
week. I mean, I, I, I don't know if you knew that. I'm not sure you saw that footage. Yeah,

16
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:26,229
it was gonna chill out, chill stream. And I mean it this time. I just want to play this game and

17
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:35,990
hang out and I'll go on one or two rants. We'll find for all time's sake. Why not? Oh shit. It's

18
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:42,629
a chill stream today. You know what I should start doing? Anytime. I just want to sit,

19
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:46,069
just kind of relax and play and hang out. I'm just going to tell you, it's going to be the most

20
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:50,169
fucked up stream ever. I'm going to tell you, man, it's going to be so exciting. There's going to be

21
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:56,870
all kinds of crazy shit's going to happen today. So then when it's the complete opposite, then we're

22
00:03:56,949 --> 00:04:09,340
good. It's, it's, that's how it's going to be, right? False advertising. That's all right.

23
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:17,290
You're still a streamer? I mean, yeah, I guess. Kind of. Yeah. What, what am I doing right now?

24
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:26,730
Dude, you're still, I streamed like four or five days ago. I haven't been gone for like six months.

25
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:40,009
But all right, you guys ready? Take a look at this. All right. So like I said, this is like

26
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:43,930
vampire survivors. I know nothing about the game. I've been told this is unbelievably fun.

27
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:53,459
I am so ready to play it. All I know is that there's this quest thing and this is chapter one.

28
00:04:54,019 --> 00:05:00,790
I cannot wait to play this. I've been sitting on this for a long time. There are 200 quests.

29
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:07,620
And the game's not even out yet. There's 201 quests. The game's not even out yet.

30
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:15,560
All right. So what do I want to do? Survive until there are only 26 minutes left. So that's easy.

31
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:29,050
Well, no, I mean, it's just an easy mission. Defeat the imp chieftain. Okay. I imagine it's

32
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:36,870
just the gigantic. Okay. It's the gigantic door. All right. Move, aim, attack, toggle,

33
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:53,079
auto attack and toggle auto aim. Ooh. Okay. Should I hold the button down? All right. Level up.

34
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:59,019
All right. So I think you can get items in the game too. The gameplay is it has control support.

35
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:06,579
I'll do just keyboard and mouse for now. I'm into it though. It's he's going to be playing on food

36
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:14,550
mode. Did you know what actually is food mode? Diablo 2 summoning classes. It's that's like the

37
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:20,970
best food mode. I thought about this a lot. Summoning necromancer and summoning druid is

38
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:29,769
the ultimate food mode. You can play with one hand. All right. Hold on. Plus 8% area cone size.

39
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:37,939
That's pretty cool. Diablo is in one. Health regen crit damage and movement speed. Hey chat,

40
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:43,990
which one? Hey chat, which one should I do? Chat's complaining about the graphics. They don't know

41
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:48,870
what the absolute. I almost just said fuck, right? They don't know what the heck they're talking

42
00:06:48,870 --> 00:07:06,779
about. I'm going to say moving speed. All right. There's something down here. Monster crits. I love

43
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:20,949
graphics. Gameplay. I have to pick up the things, but wait, I actually am moving kind of slow,

44
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:30,939
aren't I? You need to get the little guys. I think I'm doing okay. All right. Defense, range,

45
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:41,980
attack speed. I'm going to go with cone size. Is that stupid? We'll find out. Yeah. I love these

46
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:52,250
games. Vampire survivors was my game of the year last year. These are like, I love these. I'm so

47
00:07:52,250 --> 00:08:03,620
glad this is getting the treatment where a ton of people just make these. I will say though,

48
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:10,100
a lot of them, I haven't really thought were that great. I thought they were okay, but I mean,

49
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:19,050
when you're talking about the vampire survivors is the king, but I've heard this one is quite good.

50
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:28,170
Oh, probably this one crit damage. I can't wait just to start absolutely mowing down monsters.

51
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:49,049
Really going to get that feeling of just absolutely mowing down monsters. What's the plot? I don't know.

52
00:08:49,289 --> 00:08:57,779
I just like to click on the skeletons. That's all I care about. I should probably go pick up the

53
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:09,379
items though, make up some lore right now. Okay. You guys ever think that skeleton is like a really

54
00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:14,840
strange thing that we just like, Oh look, Oh yeah, it was skeleton. This is because this is somebody's

55
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:20,539
bones. Isn't like the concept of a skeleton kind of like weird in a way that's like somebody's

56
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:31,690
bones. That's your entire skeleton. Like that is weird. We all just look like that. Pickup range.

57
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:43,529
No, probably this one 10% range, 10% cone. I'm way too high for that. Uh, it's all right. Don't

58
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:52,490
worry. We're not going to, we're not going to stay on it for that long. I don't think about that

59
00:09:52,490 --> 00:10:00,629
shit, dude. I think about taxes, man. You know, what I was really thinking about the other day,

60
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:06,740
man, man, like we all have a skeleton in the inside of us. Like, yeah, dude, you know,

61
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,259
there's way more pressing shit to worry about than like the fact that we all have skeletons

62
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:15,259
in our bodies. Yeah, man. Really think about it, man. There's like, you got, you got like bones in

63
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:26,039
you. New enemy type. That's a huge great, by the way, it was like two or three times.

64
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:44,379
Jeremy, did you see the aliens are real? Yeah. Take me with you. Take me with you. Okay. Uh,

65
00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:48,299
I'm just taking this straight away. Damage or attack speed. Can I get some math? Andy's in here

66
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:59,350
to help is 10% more damage better than more DPS. I'm curious. Attack speed means you will always

67
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:04,710
be doing more damage because you were swinging more often. I'm not so sure.

68
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:13,529
Now tax fees, but I would go for tax fees for sure. Damage, damage, damage. I think I'll go speed.

69
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:24,250
Speed sounds good. How have you guys been? How's it going? What's new? I'm gonna die. Oh, I got,

70
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:43,779
I just realized I have 500 health. I think it is healed. You should talk about aliens. Yeah,

71
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:51,100
I don't know. Guys, if the, if aliens are real, like nothing we say is really like, they might

72
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,419
be pissed off that we like eat each other. You know what I mean? Well, not each other, but like

73
00:11:56,139 --> 00:11:59,100
think about like, what if, what if an alien species was like, wait a minute, you guys like,

74
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:07,610
you guys like kill and eat stuff. What do you mean? You, you eat, you eat things. You don't just take

75
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:15,860
in like energy from the air. I don't know. They might be like annoyed that we like eat stuff.

76
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:26,870
Who knows what the fuck is going to happen. I want the range actually deranged. I'm just,

77
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:30,389
we don't even know what, what it even could be. We don't even know if it's like a carbon based

78
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:41,259
life form. Nobody knows what anything, anything was going on. What is it? What would the alien

79
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:50,860
national anthem be? Ladies and gentlemen, we have landed on earth and we are going to play you

80
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:57,899
our national anthem first of all, to make sure you understand what we are all about. And it's just

81
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:09,750
just a midi version of our national anthem. And then we play them the orchestral version

82
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:26,820
and they give us all their technology area. Ooh, I did it. This is exactly what you did last time.

83
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:32,279
Yeah. Well, if you go to like a comedy show, they're going to tell like the same jokes all

84
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:38,220
year. You understand? Like if you go to like a standup show, they have like a bunch of material

85
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:43,340
that they wrote for like a year or two. And then they come up with more material, like two years

86
00:13:43,340 --> 00:14:00,490
later, you need to be better than that. I'm just hanging out mowing down monsters, man. This is

87
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:13,769
really your material. No, not really. Not really. All right. It's starting to get a little harder.

88
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:35,480
Uh, I think this can't go wrong with crit chance. Oh, how much is in the non beta?

89
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:43,639
I look like there was a pretty good amount of content in this game. Are they unique?

90
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:50,230
That's the only thing I care about in every video game. It's like 20 hours worth of content. Oh my

91
00:14:50,230 --> 00:15:03,750
God. OK, this boss is almost dead. Oh, a squill. All of your jokes are bad. Um, I don't think all

92
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:11,990
of them are. I think like maybe if I were to actually tell you what I really think, I think

93
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:21,350
that probably, probably like 20% of the jokes that I tell are bad. Maybe like 30, maybe,

94
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:32,169
maybe a little more. No, no, no, no. Wait, what is this? 30%? Hey, that means I'm batting 700.

95
00:15:32,169 --> 00:15:38,549
Even if I'm, OK, even if it's 50%, that means I'm batting 500. Do you know that you can hit,

96
00:15:38,549 --> 00:15:45,909
you can strike out seven out of 10 times and be one of the best baseball players ever. You

97
00:15:45,909 --> 00:15:49,669
could literally go up there and swing and miss seven times in a row and then hit three home runs

98
00:15:49,669 --> 00:15:59,639
and you're one of the best players ever. So let's translate that completely to, to, to my life.

99
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:03,720
And, uh, a complete false equivalence that it means absolutely nothing next to each other.

100
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,980
But I'm going to use these two points to tell you why I think that I'm doing just fine.

101
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:16,149
All right, what do I want? Astronomers Orb? Metal orbs that circle around the player and

102
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:21,049
damage enemies. Orbs are indestructible and permanent. All right, so this is build movement

103
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:25,740
speed. Short range projectiles in a vertical spread pattern. Projectiles remain for a short

104
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:36,490
while. That's OK. Lighting's my favorite type of damage. This one seems to be interesting.

105
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:53,480
How do I use it? Oh, it just happens. I always love a good roguelike. What is that? Uh, well,

106
00:16:53,480 --> 00:17:10,329
I'm doing the movement speed because this thing, this guy's fast. Jesus. Ow. Is there a block?

107
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:16,250
All right, I have to, I have to win. This is literally this, this is the tutorial boss.

108
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:39,259
I can't lose to this. Whoa. Oh my goodness. OK. Um, get rid of the adds. I need to level up.

109
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:45,779
Give me that scroll down there. What's up here? Give me the potion potion potion potion. That's

110
00:17:45,779 --> 00:18:10,599
what that is for sure. Is this a damage buff? There it is. All right. Movement speed or just

111
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:25,019
straight up damage? Probably just damage right now. Trying to get him hit by the. Oh, I'm fine.

112
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:38,789
I got him. I got him. I got him. I got him. All right. All right. Things are getting a lot harder

113
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:53,339
to kill. It's in the chest. I need more attack speed. A hundred percent. Give me that shit.

114
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:05,049
Give it to me. I can't. I'm just like swirling a drain right now. Oh, there's items. OK. This

115
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:13,130
just got way fucking cooler. This just got way cooler. 20% attack speed, 10% crit chance,

116
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:31,720
10% health. I mean, it's definitely this. Cool. Oh, I feel the speed bat chest. You can bat

117
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:39,140
chest all you want. You are totally in your right to bat chest whenever you want to bat chest.

118
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:48,599
But I'm going to disagree with your bat chest. Idiot. Sorry. I put that last part in there.

119
00:19:48,599 --> 00:20:12,619
Probably the health. Yeah, just get the orbs up. I'm going to I'm going to go up the scroll.

120
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:24,950
I did two quests already. What the hell is bat chest? It means I don't I think this thing is

121
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:29,690
cringe and it's like lame. So I'm going to that's what that's supposed to mean. Right.

122
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:38,569
It's supposed to be like, oh, my God, I'm so excited for this thing. And like, it's cringy.

123
00:20:38,569 --> 00:20:54,950
How excited I am. Right. Is that how it is? I'm just going to run down here. Oh, my God,

124
00:20:54,950 --> 00:21:11,059
Jerma. Oh, my God, Jerma bat chest. Come on. This is getting crazy right now. I'm going to

125
00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:29,910
try to wrap around this dude. Is this the Jerma stream? Oh, taking the health because I will die

126
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:49,619
if I don't click this. I like the sound effects at the very beginning of the intro, like right

127
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:55,539
when the thing loads up and you press start to play, it should go. Welcome to the halls of

128
00:21:55,859 --> 00:22:06,859
men. They can just use that if they want. No, they can't. Never mind. What am I talking about?

129
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:21,940
Oh, health and movement speed. That helps. I miss that. I miss when games used to just yell their

130
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:34,869
title card. That was cool. Why do we get away from that? We replaced having an interesting

131
00:22:34,869 --> 00:22:41,880
voice acting at the beginning that just yells the title of your game to like, I don't know,

132
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:49,980
climb up the tower and activate the radio as like every game now. Bring back the fucking

133
00:22:49,980 --> 00:23:21,269
yelling the intro speed. Yeah. Dance Dance Revolution. Does it do it? Dragon Ball Z does

134
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:35,180
that too. Well, there's a lot of shit on the ground. I mean, these are all good, but which

135
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:45,940
one is the most good? Does Mario Kart still do it? Yeah. Does he still go Mario Kart? In Mario Kart,

136
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:50,339
they even go a step forward. Like another step beyond that. It's select your player.

137
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:58,359
Choose your character. Street Fighter does it right. Street Fighter six. Yeah. And of course,

138
00:23:58,359 --> 00:24:02,680
you understand why Capcom is just absolutely killing it lately. They just they say all the

139
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:21,619
names of their games in their intro. I know a lot of you didn't think I was going to get this far

140
00:24:21,619 --> 00:24:26,180
on my first run, but you have no idea how much I loved Vampire Survivors. It's like my favorite

141
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:40,789
video game. I'm going to say, well, let's go with the 70 health. Do you get to keep the items?

142
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:51,059
All right. This is the end here for sure. Yeah. Yep. OK. All right. Character level 18. Survival

143
00:24:51,059 --> 00:25:02,309
12 minutes. You suck. You're supposed to die. They don't understand these games. All right.

144
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:09,589
What did I get? I unlocked the Archer. I unlocked under the stage. I got a new ability,

145
00:25:09,589 --> 00:25:16,779
Ring Blades. And then I got a Shrine of Blessings. The next quest is to enter Ember Grounds and

146
00:25:16,779 --> 00:25:24,390
rescue the Wellkeeper. Cool. I got a thousand bucks. I thought you did good. I thought I did

147
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:35,450
good, too. Let's do Archer. What's this? Oh, and there's a shitload of upgrades. OK,

148
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:45,640
this is probably permanent. Yeah, permanent. Probably this one. Attack range, pick up range,

149
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:55,819
movement speed. Oh, yeah. Let's go movement speed twice. Movement speed is just so important.

150
00:25:55,819 --> 00:26:03,299
Register of Halls. Choose your destination in the Halls of Torment. Oh, OK. The next quest was here.

151
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:10,099
I don't think I'm going to do it yet. Let me look at that. Let me look at the missions. OK. Kill

152
00:26:10,099 --> 00:26:15,609
five thousand enemies in one run. Deal seven hundred and fifty thousand damage with the orbs.

153
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:21,940
Deal seven hundred and fifty thousand damage with Phantom Needles. All right. So kill five

154
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:28,569
thousand enemies in one run. Sounds easy. Can you please comment on Quiznos? I like Quiznos.

155
00:26:28,569 --> 00:26:36,150
I haven't had it in a long time, but I love it. I'll do. Yeah, let's go for it. Let's just do it

156
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:57,269
again. Can I have a turn now? No, it's my Xbox. This character seems very, very good. I'm telling

157
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:08,490
You got a PlayStation. I have the Xbox. Go play Demon's Souls or whatever is on that fucking

158
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:22,970
console. I'm on the Xbox. More speed. Is this game even on Xbox? No, it's not. I'm on PC.

159
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:43,740
Is it on Game Pass? I have all three. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Hey, come on. I'm going to go just

160
00:27:43,740 --> 00:28:00,920
all damage on this one. You can probably increase the projectiles. I hope so. I'm going to go pick

161
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:11,960
that parchment up, whatever that is. How do people play this with a mouse? If I was going

162
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:23,259
to play with controller, I would do auto aim. These are all kind of weak block strength. What

163
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:34,660
if you don't have a shield? I'll go defense. Aiming with the mouse is going to be always be

164
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:45,180
a thousand times easier than aiming with an analog. So I will probably play with the mouse

165
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:55,670
forever. All right. Let me go down this way. This is in VR. I'm the character down there.

166
00:28:55,670 --> 00:29:13,140
I just don't know. I don't have the webcam on today. Oh, that's really good. Yeah. I'm just

167
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:19,640
I rented out a warehouse. I have like 50 or 60 thousand square feet here. So it's really

168
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:41,609
roomy here. That's why I can move around this much. I can't decide if I like this joke.

169
00:29:41,609 --> 00:29:49,740
We have an undecided joke voter here. What do we do? What do we do to convince them?

170
00:29:49,740 --> 00:30:10,339
Is there a map? You're doing your make shit up voice. It's so funny. We talked about this before,

171
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:21,289
but this is just the way I normally talk. Dude, why is he doing the bit voice? Oh,

172
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:24,410
it's just like the way the dude actually just like kind of talks normally.

173
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:56,099
Everything is a bit. I don't know if I'd say that. I just like having fun laughing my ass off the

174
00:30:56,099 --> 00:31:00,339
other day. Do you remember when that guy did that zoom call thing where he got like beat up in an

175
00:31:00,339 --> 00:31:10,839
octagon? Oh, yeah. You know, when you you okay, you know, when you see somebody do something and

176
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:23,799
you wish you made that joke. Let's do a text. You guys have never seen that video of the guys

177
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:28,680
that link in a zoom call and he's like a green screen behind him, like attached to a backpack

178
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:35,750
on him. And he's in like an octagon. He's getting like beat up in his zoom meeting.

179
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:44,809
You've never seen this. It's it's fucking insane. Show it. I don't even know how to look for it.

180
00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:52,700
I just I just remember seeing it. Bro picked eight over 20 percent. Oh, shit. Hold on.

181
00:31:54,599 --> 00:32:17,029
This is really good. I do want to get down to the parchment, though. It was during Covid.

182
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:40,470
It's so funny. What is this? Oh, it was a thing to get a quest for this. Fires needles at random

183
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:46,950
nearby enemies in quick succession. Multi hit increases the attack speed. I'll do it. I'm going

184
00:32:46,950 --> 00:33:10,710
to need it right now. OK, multi hit. Go 10 percent damage. I need more piercing movement speed.

185
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:22,259
No, I need more. Yeah, let's keep going. Attack speed. One more level up and I'm going down to get

186
00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:39,829
the ability or chance. You just made me buy this game. I mean, the game is fun. I mean, did you

187
00:33:39,829 --> 00:33:45,430
open the stream and see this thing that may have been speaking to you and your gameplay preferences?

188
00:33:45,430 --> 00:34:03,289
That's what that's what just happened. All right. I'm being stupid, but I want the experience.

189
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:11,880
I'm doing it for a reason. All right. These are all good. I don't know what to do.

190
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:31,619
You're a really good salesman. Um, I don't I do not think so. Uh, 20 percent crit damage seems

191
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:42,860
amazing, but so does attack speed. That's just this game sounds like I'm sorting through a Lego bin.

192
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:59,190
Kind of does. Like, where is that fucking little square with the two pegs on it?

193
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:06,789
And it needs to be green. This is why I keep saying I need to organize these fucking things.

194
00:35:07,429 --> 00:35:14,340
I just throw them in here. How am I ever going to be able to finish the Millennium Falcon now?

195
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:50,199
Um, more health. Pick up range. I know it's lame, but I need it. Uh, give me the crits. Yep.

196
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:58,659
It's day 34. Can you wear a nun cosplay? Uh, this is day 34 of me telling you once on day 34,

197
00:35:58,659 --> 00:36:04,099
the answer is no. So the next 6000 days of you asking this are going to be a waste of your time.

198
00:36:04,099 --> 00:36:22,840
There's so much over here. I don't want to miss it. There's so many little crunchies over here.

199
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:34,440
Guard the middle. There we go. All right. Five percent crit, 20 percent crit damage. That's

200
00:36:34,440 --> 00:37:03,289
amazing. I'm so good on health. This first boss seems really fun and challenging, but fair enough.

201
00:37:03,929 --> 00:37:17,849
I like the first boss. What's this? Is this me reading?

202
00:37:30,889 --> 00:37:36,679
All right. Do I get this or something? Do I have to do anything with that or is it just lore?

203
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:53,380
Somebody said not looking great, bro. What do you mean? Me playing? I'm doing fine.

204
00:37:54,099 --> 00:37:57,380
I haven't gotten hit for three minutes. You're telling me it's not looking good for me?

205
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:01,130
It's been three minutes. I've taken a point of damage. That's got achievement for it.

206
00:38:06,889 --> 00:38:17,510
Yes. All right. Give me that loot crit chance. 80 percent pick up range. It's definitely this one.

207
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:33,110
I mean, 10 percent crit. That's nothing can compare to that. Give me a speed. There we go.

208
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:38,150
One attack per second. One, two, three, four. There's even more than one per second.

209
00:38:38,869 --> 00:38:52,360
All right. I'm getting too cocky. Don't be stupid. Go collect. All right. Now go down.

210
00:38:52,920 --> 00:39:15,619
Wait, there's like trinkets here. Come on, level up. What am I lacking in right now? More attack

211
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:49,210
speed. That actually is kind of getting ugly. You're right. I'm going to turn on auto attack

212
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:56,019
while I collect. That's definitely the time to do it. Oh, wait a minute. It's auto attack, not auto

213
00:39:56,019 --> 00:40:02,139
aim. That I'm really glad I figured that out. So I don't have to hold down left click. Oh,

214
00:40:02,139 --> 00:40:11,820
that's a huge deal. That is a monumental deal. There's so much stuff over here, but

215
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:27,139
whatever. Just go for it. Give me, give me everything. Is it health or is it just more crit?

216
00:40:27,139 --> 00:40:34,570
It's over believers. It might not be. I don't know if it's over yet. I'm going to take the health.

217
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:38,619
I know it's a lame upgrade, but it's effectively drinking a health potion

218
00:40:39,579 --> 00:41:00,099
and it's gone already. I would have been dead. I need damage. I need piercing and I need damage

219
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:31,400
right now. I mean, that's good enough. Damage is damage. All right. I'm now I'm finally going to

220
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:52,860
leave. Uh, more damage. All right. Now I'm running. They're starting to need multiple hits with my

221
00:41:52,860 --> 00:42:10,070
main weapon to die. Oh shit. Okay. Hold on. He never picks up the regen lamp. What's the

222
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:18,659
region lamp? Is that a cool game feature that I haven't been interacting with? Don't tell him

223
00:42:18,659 --> 00:42:25,860
that. What do you mean? Don't tell me that. He doesn't know about the regen lamp stand. Oh,

224
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:40,920
I thought that was a lamp. Walk over the fire. A lot of money. I'm missing out on a lot of

225
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:47,300
experience, but I don't care. I'm getting the other ability. Who knows how far away this is,

226
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:53,539
but whatever. Where's your movement speed to eight, eight milliseconds a second.

227
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:15,639
I'm going to hang on here for just a second. More damage. These guys drop a lot of experience.

228
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:22,119
This dude has an NA education. All right. Cause I'm just doing damage only. What do you mean?

229
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:43,699
This is where I lost last time. Already made more progress. Oh, give me, come on. Come on.

230
00:43:44,679 --> 00:44:08,199
Yeah. Uh, I'm doing movement speed. These things are fast. I'm going to wrap around. There's a lot

231
00:44:08,199 --> 00:44:27,909
of experience here. I don't even care if I die. When are you going to do the auto treat review

232
00:44:27,909 --> 00:44:37,349
stream? Um, I don't know. I don't want to give auto too many treats. These are all kind of bad,

233
00:44:37,349 --> 00:45:05,289
but I think I'll take this one. What's this? Ooh, he wants all the treats to himself.

234
00:45:05,289 --> 00:45:13,559
You ever look at the back of a thing of dog treats or a thing of dog food and you go,

235
00:45:13,559 --> 00:45:19,610
I could survive on this in the apocalypse. I'll be fine. You look at the ingredients list and

236
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:24,219
you're like, damn, okay. These like, these like really good treats for dogs. The,

237
00:45:24,219 --> 00:45:42,889
I could probably eat these in the apocalypse. I'm going to run. Why did you not get damaged?

238
00:45:42,889 --> 00:45:47,500
Cause I want to be running very fast because these things are fast and it's kind of freaking

239
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:58,250
me out. Remember avoiding damage means you can live longer to deal more damage. Defense

240
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:08,199
is directly translated to offense in a lot of these games that are in this genre. If you stay

241
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:22,090
alive for 10 minutes, you'll do more damage than if you stayed alive for eight, thus increasing

242
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:44,550
your score. All right. This big skeleton has to go. All right. 30% more 5% crit. Yep. Are you

243
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:53,750
guys doing the longer the enemy lives, the more damage it does to you. But if you don't get hit

244
00:46:56,119 --> 00:47:10,869
and get good, as they say, all right, there goes the, Oh, that was just his shield.

245
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:16,550
His shield is the only thing I killed. Oh, that's not funny. Uh, this might be the end.

246
00:47:24,059 --> 00:47:28,460
That's at some point I'm going to be at like, I'm pretty much at like 60, 50% crit or something.

247
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:45,659
Aren't I? Something kind of crazy. He needs a better gaming chair. No, I, I actually really

248
00:47:45,659 --> 00:48:02,179
don't. I'm doing just fine. What do you mean? I'm doing fine. I gotta get rid of this thing.

249
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:16,889
Come on. All right. There we go. Can't get it yet. Uh, moving speed and help. What about, yeah, no

250
00:48:17,449 --> 00:48:27,159
moving speed and help. That second boss has to die. Give me the other ability.

251
00:48:28,869 --> 00:48:35,340
Ring blades throws blades left and right and alternation blades act like boomerangs passing

252
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:42,550
the character and then flying off screen. Multi-hit increases the frequency of throwing blades.

253
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:48,920
Lightning strike is random. I imagine it's just like in vampire survivors, stuns enemies for a

254
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:55,320
brief period. Stun enemies can't move, right? Electricity electrified deals damage. 100 each

255
00:48:55,320 --> 00:49:01,320
tick based on the amount of stacks. Ooh, that was a big, that was a bad one. Each stack decreases

256
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:06,659
the tick time. When electrified ticks, it is reduced by one stack. I didn't read that. I

257
00:49:06,659 --> 00:49:21,719
didn't comprehend any of that. I'm going to go with ring blades. No lightning. He's so drunk.

258
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:29,750
Yeah, that was like a, Hey, I just, um, can somebody read this for me?

259
00:49:30,949 --> 00:49:48,699
Like the drunk Looney Tunes character. Uh, I'm getting close to dying and I would have died

260
00:49:48,699 --> 00:50:00,099
right there. If, what is this? It comes with a negative. I mean, we're just going with this.

261
00:50:00,659 --> 00:50:06,179
It's 30% more damage. Are you kidding me? All right. I can stay alive. I'm going to be quiet.

262
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:32,179
I actually don't want to die. All right. I unlocked a new wind crown, piercing wind.

263
00:50:32,739 --> 00:50:45,780
They get 500 bucks. Cool. All right. I, what do I, what do I, let's try sword again.

264
00:50:50,039 --> 00:51:06,420
I got, I killed 3,600 enemies in one run. Not quite there. Now it's just, uh, I'm going to do

265
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:21,019
the other stage. I think that unlocks more stuff. Yeah. Rescue the wellkeeper. All right. Go for it.

266
00:51:21,019 --> 00:51:36,920
Auto aim is toggleable too. That's really cool. All right. Let's go for it. Ooh, this is harder.

267
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:47,340
They have a lot more health. I just break them out. I love this avatar.

268
00:51:52,260 --> 00:52:11,159
See what I can do. You can't die, right? He must be nearby. I have to level up a few times.

269
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:22,360
Everybody does not believe right now. Um, I mean, this is a new level. This is harder than the first

270
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:29,320
one. And this is a rogue like with permanent upgrades. I'm going to say, I don't know if I

271
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:34,340
would be betting on the yes right now, maybe a few runs, but who knows? What if I do really good and

272
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:56,300
you make a huge amount of channel points? I'm going to go tank. Ooh, key. They're manageable.

273
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:32,519
Oh, I didn't upgrade last time. It's all right. Try to hit as many as possible damage. Yeah.

274
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:42,170
You don't have any precision, dude. Um, I don't, you don't need precision in a game like this.

275
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:48,869
It's about surviving waves and mowing down. I don't know why I keep saying that. It's because

276
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:53,750
it's cause that's like the thing that kind of looks like the Diablo thing, like mowing down

277
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:57,750
waves of enemies, mowing down monsters. And I sit here and ask myself, when did I,

278
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:15,670
have I ever cared about that in Diablo? Like I've never have ever. Um, okay. Back speed. Remember,

279
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:25,500
these are people. Well, they're well, we're in hell. So, okay. What do you want to say?

280
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:38,739
Uh, cone size. Yep. It's devil spawn. These are not people. These are devil spawn. What are you

281
00:54:38,739 --> 00:54:50,199
talking about? No, this is the, this is the non completely nondescript bad guy character.

282
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:55,159
So you never have to feel anything about like, oh, what am I killing here? Because they're like,

283
00:54:57,079 --> 00:55:03,079
yes, murder and torture and killing. Like this, you don't feel bad. You can't feel bad about

284
00:55:03,079 --> 00:55:08,199
killing like demon imps. They've, we've specifically been told this for like the last a hundred years

285
00:55:08,199 --> 00:55:13,699
of any like media and video games and anything. It's just, oh, these things are just evil creatures

286
00:55:13,699 --> 00:55:18,650
that hurt stuff. And we're also led to believe that they can just be kind of created, just like

287
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:33,670
snap. Oh, there's like another 2000 of them. I didn't even read that last part. Hey dude,

288
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:49,530
can you find Ben Franklin and that person for an hour? This, I have not hurt this guy yet. Uh,

289
00:55:50,409 --> 00:56:19,590
more cone. You actually ban him. What are your thoughts on POE? I mean, I'm excited to play it.

290
00:56:23,219 --> 00:56:29,820
The, okay. So POE, let me go over this. So I've played a little bit of lost dark. I played a

291
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:35,480
little bit of POE. I've played obviously a lot of Diablo, but my concern with something like POE,

292
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:40,699
and this is what I've talked to stir about this a few times. Uh, my concern was always,

293
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:46,619
it's not that it's overwhelming. It's that there is just such an unbelievable amount of content

294
00:56:46,619 --> 00:56:52,460
that I'm going to accidentally open up one of the menus for said content and have, and gets

295
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:56,699
freaked out. It's kind of like when you open up one of these MMO type games or these like kind of

296
00:56:56,699 --> 00:57:01,739
live service games after a while of not playing. And the game is just like, Hey, you've missed,

297
00:57:01,739 --> 00:57:07,980
um, literally like seven years of patches and updates and changes. Uh, here's like 10 pop-up

298
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:13,420
windows to explain to you every massive, monumental fucking ridiculous change we've made over the last

299
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:26,340
five years. It's just, I don't even know where to start. I want to start. And it's not an excuse

300
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:31,300
because there's plenty of, you know, if you really care, you'll do it. But I think it was just the

301
00:57:32,019 --> 00:57:38,260
prospect of not ever paid paying attention and having to, and even the stuff they were

302
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:43,139
talking about at exile con was like, Holy shit, this is so cool. You can make a rogue like dungeon

303
00:57:43,139 --> 00:57:48,260
and trade it. And wait, this is, they're bringing this back. Oh, by the way, like stir was telling

304
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:53,699
me there's like, there's like 15 different end game, like whole zones to like care about and

305
00:57:53,699 --> 00:57:58,099
like make a character around. Oh, by the way, there's like 7,000 uniques in the game. Oh,

306
00:57:58,099 --> 00:58:00,900
it's like, Holy shit. That sounds like the, that sounds like my favorite game ever made.

307
00:58:01,619 --> 00:58:08,380
My favorite game ever made is D2. It's just a fact. It just is what I liked about D2. That's

308
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:17,369
not in a lot of the ARPGs now is it's incredible simplicity. It was very simple. It was very easy

309
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:26,260
to understand, but like I could be an item fine barbarian if I wanted to. I think that's what I

310
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:31,139
liked the most about it is there's like 30 moves. This character has, do you want to be a Raven

311
00:58:31,139 --> 00:58:36,869
Druid? I mean, is that stupid? Maybe, but who cares? Put 20 points into it and have fun. I'm,

312
00:58:36,869 --> 00:58:45,380
that's what I'm looking for. D2 was the worst Diablo game. I mean, you're literally talking about

313
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:49,619
like my, like my entire identity is based around this game. So like you're, that's a personal

314
00:58:49,619 --> 00:59:03,239
attack, not doom too. That was a, that was a personal, no, not destiny to Diablo too. What

315
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:16,139
D2 Diablo to not destiny to, I played a little bit of destiny too. It was fun. It was all right. I

316
00:59:16,139 --> 00:59:24,969
didn't, I didn't really get into it, but I could understand why people played it. But I thought

317
00:59:24,969 --> 00:59:31,610
about this the other day. What is it about seeing the beige kind of beige golden letters on the

318
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:37,880
ground? It's the fact that I kind of don't even know what it is. And even if it sucks, who cares?

319
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:44,730
It's got like cool artwork and I can give that to like my level three Amazon. It's like a level

320
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:50,699
five unique. And the thing's a piece of shit. The thing sucks, but who cares? It's like a fun

321
00:59:50,699 --> 00:59:56,230
little thing to collect and it's got a custom art for each little piece. I can, I can keep it

322
00:59:56,230 --> 01:00:08,070
in a little inventory. Everything feels like handmade. It all feels handmade. What don't you

323
01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:14,250
like about D4's uniques? First of all, there's like, when I played D, I played a lot of D4 off

324
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:16,889
stream. I really did. I'll give you my real, I'm going to give you the real take cause I know I've

325
01:00:16,889 --> 01:00:24,599
been, you know, I haven't been given you the real one. I just don't like the aspects. I just,

326
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:28,440
I just really don't like that system. I haven't liked the legendary system since D3

327
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:40,139
and they leaned even more heavily into it. I would rather instead of legendaries with legendary

328
01:00:40,139 --> 01:00:45,019
powers, just get rid of that entire system and just have like three fucking hundred uniques in

329
01:00:45,019 --> 01:00:48,619
the game and have them all fun and interesting and have them unique and have them have cool artwork

330
01:00:48,619 --> 01:00:53,500
and let me collect them. That's it. That's what I want. That's what I want. That's all I wanted.

331
01:00:54,139 --> 01:00:59,269
And then somebody would just say, just play D2. Yeah, that's true. D2 got remastered and the

332
01:00:59,269 --> 01:01:07,880
remaster is very, very good. Yeah. You're right. You're right. You're absolutely right. But I've

333
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:13,800
kind of been waiting for a D2 sequel for like 30 years. Do you know what I mean? It's just like,

334
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:21,239
God damn it. I just want, I want D2 more. I want like D2 too. Does that make me an old boomer?

335
01:01:21,239 --> 01:01:32,820
Probably, but that's just how I feel. That's Diablo 3. Diablo 3 is not Diablo 2 too. Diablo 3

336
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:39,670
is the base for Diablo 4, which is why I prefer Diablo 2. The Diablo 2 item system, I think,

337
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:45,289
and plus I think about gems. I like to just collect them and you could make them and it's like,

338
01:01:45,289 --> 01:01:53,079
oh wow, I've got like five perfect topazes. Throw that shit into a five, six socket chest,

339
01:01:53,079 --> 01:01:57,239
give yourself some magic fine and go have a goddamn fucking fun time killing Mephisto

340
01:01:57,239 --> 01:02:06,010
four times in a row. Who cares? POE has gems. I'm going to play POE. I'm going to play it.

341
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:16,599
German, none of those words are in the Bible. No, they're not. Are they? Is the word gem? It

342
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:27,989
might be. In my honest opinion, Diablo 4 kind of, they kind of just made this game where it was

343
01:02:27,989 --> 01:02:32,150
just, it wasn't about the fact that they made the game. It was the fact that they wanted you to just

344
01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:37,670
play it. It wasn't about making the game. It was about making sure you play it. Do you understand

345
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:43,500
what I mean by that? Does anybody get that? Like, do you, does anybody understand what I mean by

346
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:56,949
that? It's not about the game being good. It's about making sure you play it. And let me be very,

347
01:02:56,949 --> 01:03:02,230
very clear. I do think that the Diablo 4 devs really do want to have a good game. I think they

348
01:03:02,230 --> 01:03:06,789
really want to make a great experience. And you know what? Over the next few years, they probably

349
01:03:06,789 --> 01:03:13,829
will. They'll probably make a pretty fleshed out end game system. But the core of Diablo 4, the very

350
01:03:13,829 --> 01:03:23,190
fundamentals of that game, I do not like. So I, I don't, Diablo 2, I don't think I'm, I don't think

351
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:38,019
I'm ever going to get the sequel that I ever really wanted. And that's all right. Oh my God, gone are

352
01:03:38,019 --> 01:03:50,329
the days of centrist Andy. No, but that's just how I feel. That's just the truth of how I feel.

353
01:03:51,130 --> 01:03:57,159
There are a lot of people that really, really liked D4. I'm not going to tell you that you are

354
01:03:57,159 --> 01:04:01,800
stupid or wrong for liking D4 a lot. I'm not going to say that to you because if you like it, then

355
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:07,429
you like it. I'm not going to tell you that you can't like it. I'm just going to tell you that I

356
01:04:07,429 --> 01:04:26,630
don't. Okay. You already said that. That I, wait, when did I say that? I'm going to die. But nothing

357
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:34,070
will ever hit the same as finding, you know, and I want to identify items. I want to identify items.

358
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:41,110
Do you know what I mean? I don't want to just pick up a bunch of shit and just have it be like

359
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:47,110
just a mess in my inventory. And it's just green and red letters. And which one is green letters?

360
01:04:47,110 --> 01:04:51,269
Which has red letters? How many, what, what, how many percent? Everything has a percentage on it.

361
01:04:51,269 --> 01:04:55,590
Everything's a percentage percentage to percentage of a percentage to this percentage. So I don't

362
01:04:55,590 --> 01:04:58,630
want to see, I just, I want real numbers. I don't want percentages. Give me a number.

363
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:10,630
I'm going off. I don't want it like the 20% chance to do 10% more vulnerability damage. If you have

364
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:17,699
10% more, no, I just give me, I want 25 dexterity on that item. And I want the art to look really

365
01:05:17,699 --> 01:05:21,780
cool. Cause there's a lot of talented artists and shit. And I want it to have beige letters. And I

366
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:27,780
want to have a big collection box where I can put these items and I want to trade them. I want to

367
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:32,579
be able to fucking, I want to be able to, I lost, but whatever. He's still going. Okay.

368
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:46,090
Nobody talks shit about Diablo more than somebody that says Diablo is my favorite game. Yeah,

369
01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:52,250
you got, okay. You've got me here. You do got me, but let me tell you, let me just try to make it

370
01:05:52,250 --> 01:06:01,579
as clear as I can. Diablo two was just such a, was such an unbelievable genre defining experience.

371
01:06:01,579 --> 01:06:07,289
Like nothing really was ever really like that. There was a couple things kind of, but it just,

372
01:06:07,289 --> 01:06:15,099
they just paved the whole road for every action RPG that came after it. And it's hard to play

373
01:06:15,099 --> 01:06:20,940
a game that's supposed to be a Diablo sequel, Diablo two, Diablo three, a numbered sequel.

374
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:28,199
And have, in my opinion, they go so far away from what made me like Diablo so much that it's not

375
01:06:28,199 --> 01:06:37,880
really even a numbered sequel for me anymore. PoE is better than D2. I think PoE has had a lot more

376
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:44,500
time of to be developed. Diablo two was, was done by Blizzard North. They just kind of made the game

377
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,539
and it released. There wasn't like a bunch. I mean, they did patches and they added stuff and that

378
01:06:47,539 --> 01:06:53,139
like ladder and everything and D2, the expansion, everything. But PoE has been continuously developed

379
01:06:53,139 --> 01:07:03,460
for about 10 years. Who is he talking to? Um, you. I'm talking to you. How can you call yourself a

380
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:09,539
Diablo fan when you dislike 75% of Diablo games? I don't, I don't dislike Diablo one. I think Diablo

381
01:07:09,539 --> 01:07:15,960
one was almost like an experiment. I think Diablo two was the first like Diablo is a big game that

382
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:23,340
everybody cares about now. I think Diablo one was more of like an awesome experiment. All right,

383
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:27,110
I'm going for it. I want to do the first mission. I feel like I was doing pretty good in that one.

384
01:07:27,110 --> 01:07:37,480
Diablo one's a good time. Yeah. All right. I'm going for it this time. I'm going to go right to

385
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:51,300
the scroll. I like random. I just don't like everything is random and everything is random

386
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:56,900
to an extent. Let me give you an example. I know, I know this is like, finally he like took, he like

387
01:07:56,900 --> 01:08:02,409
is, he's finally giving his Diablo four take. I know, but it's been a while. It's been a long

388
01:08:02,409 --> 01:08:09,579
time coming. Uh, what was I, what was I just going to say? I actually just forgot everything. What

389
01:08:09,579 --> 01:08:15,099
was the last sentence I said? What was the last sentence I said? I'm, I was like looking at reading

390
01:08:15,099 --> 01:08:20,810
the, um, the thing up there. What was the last thing I said? Random. Okay. Random. Yeah. I like

391
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:25,960
random, but I don't like when things are too random, but they're random in a box. Let me give you an

392
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:34,199
example. For instance, in D four, if I wanted to make like a charged bolt, a charged bolt sorcerer

393
01:08:34,199 --> 01:08:42,250
sorceress, right there, there are items in the game that completely change charge bolts, right?

394
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:48,090
There's also, you can get us to charge bolts on a pair of gloves or I think it's legs, whatever it

395
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:54,649
is, but that can only appear on a certain couple pieces of gear. Why can't it roll on everything

396
01:08:54,649 --> 01:09:00,680
else? Why can't plus to charge bolts roll on anything? Why does it have to roll on like one

397
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:11,350
item only in one specific slot? Why? What if I want to try to get like a bunch of points into

398
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:19,350
charge bolts? Why can't I just put it on a bunch of shit? And every item seems to like, I don't know,

399
01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:22,789
just feels like when I do a bunch of runs, like, oh, I'm going to do some nightmare dungeons and

400
01:09:22,789 --> 01:09:28,380
then I'm going to do the hell tide or whatever. All right, cool. I have a full inventory of shit

401
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:32,779
of like a bunch of legendaries and rares and, and now you go, you scroll over to me like,

402
01:09:32,779 --> 01:09:36,140
I don't even know what the fuck half of this shit even is saying to me. Like, what, what,

403
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:41,670
what even is better? I don't just salvage the whole inventory. This is like, I guess, I mean,

404
01:09:41,670 --> 01:09:48,420
I found the distant enemies are stunned like eight times and I guess I'm just going to keep one of

405
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:54,439
them. I had a full inventory. I had a full stash of aspects that I was just like, these are all,

406
01:09:54,439 --> 01:10:00,970
I don't even know what the fuck to do with these. Dude, stop being a nerd. People are leaving. Hey,

407
01:10:00,970 --> 01:10:04,970
I've been pressed to give my Diablo four take for like two months and I haven't given it and I'm

408
01:10:04,970 --> 01:10:19,619
giving it to you now. TLDR in Diablo two, even when a piece of shit unique drops, you just see

409
01:10:19,619 --> 01:10:26,069
the beige letters and you go, Ooh, when like a legendary ring drops in D four, I don't even

410
01:10:26,069 --> 01:10:31,560
fucking care. I just don't, I don't even care. It's just like, Oh, that's just going to be a

411
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:36,819
bunch of random stats and a random aspect. I don't even care. And you pick it up and she's like,

412
01:10:36,819 --> 01:10:41,539
okay, is this like 1% better than the one aspect of this that I already have? I don't know. I guess

413
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:57,989
throw it away. I guess your TLDR is way too long. Is beige really a deal breaker? Yeah,

414
01:10:57,989 --> 01:11:06,949
it kind of is. And because to me asked that it matters a lot to me. I want to be able to like

415
01:11:06,949 --> 01:11:12,789
pick that item up. Like what was that big mall in D two bone snap, right? It was, it was in,

416
01:11:13,590 --> 01:11:18,729
when you identify it, it like, well, there's the artwork, right? Remember that shit. Remember that

417
01:11:18,729 --> 01:11:24,010
shit. Hey, remember that shit. Remember when you, you, you've, you actually identified it

418
01:11:24,010 --> 01:11:29,100
and the artwork showed up. Give me, give me, I want the items to be, have like, wait, I want

419
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:32,939
them to fucking have visuals. I don't want them just to be like a bunch of fucking rolled stats.

420
01:11:32,939 --> 01:11:42,250
I don't give a shit about any of that. I don't care about any of that. Go get the scroll. Oh yeah,

421
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:48,250
I will do the D four ramp, but do it in a quagmire voice now. Hey, so I mean,

422
01:11:48,569 --> 01:11:55,529
Hey, Hey, Peter, so Diablo four. Oh, right. It's, it's actually kind of a, I'm not a big fan of it.

423
01:12:14,149 --> 01:12:22,819
That hurt me physically worse than the Deadpool routine. I, you know, I, I will stand by the

424
01:12:22,819 --> 01:12:27,460
Deadpool routine. I thought that was a good time. I think some of you are hating on the Deadpool

425
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:31,460
routine and you don't even, you don't even, you didn't get it. I don't think you got it. You didn't

426
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:38,329
get it. I just don't think you got it. I, you know what I mean? I really think you just didn't

427
01:12:38,329 --> 01:12:43,689
get it. Yeah. Some of you got it, but a lot of you didn't. And a lot of you like hate my Deadpool.

428
01:12:43,689 --> 01:13:03,289
Let me get it. I was reeling in pain. Yeah, it's all right. All right. I'm going to get the scroll.

429
01:13:03,289 --> 01:13:13,909
I'm not, wait, let's read this. Let us into the darkness. Brines awaited with a sacrifice in

430
01:13:13,909 --> 01:13:24,920
exchange for a fragment of the token trade its old master to finally end his atrocious reign.

431
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:44,760
Go get the scroll, Madge. I'm going, I'll get it. I am 100% going to play POE 2. I will. POE 1,

432
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:48,680
when the new league comes out. I'll definitely check it out. I already played a little bit of

433
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:52,279
Path of Exile just because, you know, obviously stir plays a lot and he's like, this is my

434
01:13:52,279 --> 01:13:57,079
favorite game. Please. I know you like D2. Please for the love of God play it. Why do you keep not

435
01:13:57,079 --> 01:14:01,960
playing this? You keep saying D2 is your favorite game ever. Why won't you play the game that is

436
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:07,479
supposed to be a successor to that game you love so much? Why there's like 70, there's like 10

437
01:14:07,479 --> 01:14:14,550
years worth of content. You'll never get to the end of it. And I go, I'm maybe with a D Diablo 4

438
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:23,899
might patch in and some more uniques. It's not, it's not going to happen. It's not going to happen.

439
01:14:23,899 --> 01:14:30,220
When I heard that Diablo 4 was bringing uniques back, I rejoiced. I was like, we are going back

440
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:38,789
to the old Diablo 2 style. It's going to be uniques. It's going to be so, oh, our aspects are back.

441
01:14:38,789 --> 01:14:44,149
And they just, you can pull them off and you have to stick them on a rare. And then like everything's

442
01:14:44,149 --> 01:14:48,939
kind of like, there's no value on anything. And you can't even trade with somebody in your own

443
01:14:48,939 --> 01:14:53,770
fucking party. And trading doesn't matter anyways, cause you get the same piece of gear over and over

444
01:14:53,770 --> 01:15:07,909
again. Cause it's like the smart loot with the class and then everything's scaled and which is

445
01:15:07,909 --> 01:15:17,180
one of the good ones here. I just want crafted items back. You're always complaining, dude.

446
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:24,779
Enjoy yourself once. I don't think I'm complaining a lot. I'm always, what? No, I'm not. I give a

447
01:15:24,779 --> 01:15:41,579
lot of benefit of the doubt to a lot of games. I'll try. Yeah. I'll do ring blades. All right.

448
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:45,180
Now I actually, I'm going to level up one more time and I'm going to go get the thing down there.

449
01:15:45,819 --> 01:15:59,109
It's so funny because you remember when I played the default beta on stream, I was going into that

450
01:15:59,109 --> 01:16:06,550
with woo. Uh, yeah. I remember saying very, very clearly, it was like, this feels kind of fun.

451
01:16:07,189 --> 01:16:11,109
The first five to 10 levels of D four, I was like, holy shit, this is going to be the best game I've

452
01:16:11,109 --> 01:16:15,210
ever played in my entire life. I didn't want to say it on stream because I don't, I didn't want

453
01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:20,470
to be like, you know, jumping the gun, right? Turns out it was not the case at all. It was

454
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:34,460
almost the complete opposite. And I remember saying on stream, hold on. I love this, but I don't,

455
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:38,779
I got to be really careful. I don't, what if I, let me give it some more time. I'm so glad I said

456
01:16:38,779 --> 01:16:54,859
that. All I remember from that was grip gate. You know, that's like part of that makes me kind of

457
01:16:54,859 --> 01:17:00,140
happy because well, like the weird dumb shit that we talk about on these streams, the fact that the

458
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:04,060
one thing that you remembered from that whole thing was not the fact that of like my opinion

459
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:10,699
of Diablo, it was the fact that we talked about like somebody's grip and nothing else mattered on

460
01:17:10,699 --> 01:17:16,300
that stream. Right? So like, we go over a lot on these streams and it's kind of almost refreshing

461
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:19,739
to know that the only thing that you particularly care about is like me talking about somebody's

462
01:17:19,739 --> 01:17:40,739
grip. You wanted to say Cyclops drip. Yeah. And my compressor cut it off. All right. Now I'm

463
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:48,470
actually officially going to go get the archment. I know people like bring back room words. I don't,

464
01:17:48,470 --> 01:17:52,229
I don't really necessarily care too much about room words. I just want the, I want the socketable

465
01:17:52,229 --> 01:18:01,100
items to feel good. It didn't feel bad putting a shitty ass chipped ass gem in some piece of

466
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:06,390
shit gear that you knew you were going to use for like five levels. That was actually useful.

467
01:18:07,029 --> 01:18:11,670
I almost feel like the whole gem system in D4 is completely fucking meaningless.

468
01:18:11,670 --> 01:18:24,819
It is 100% meaningless. Maybe one of them are like, I'm giving you my D4 take. I feel like your rant

469
01:18:24,819 --> 01:18:32,170
is meaningless. I mean, I guess it kind of is. But don't you think my rant about like what kind

470
01:18:32,170 --> 01:18:38,619
of peanut butter is my favorite is also pretty meaningless? I mean, I guess this has a little

471
01:18:38,619 --> 01:18:56,409
bit of substance. Okay. Definitely the orbs. These things are awesome. That would be more entertaining.

472
01:18:57,609 --> 01:19:13,819
Yeah. I'm telling you how I feel. That's what I'm doing. All right. Give me something good.

473
01:19:17,829 --> 01:19:20,789
1% attack speed for five seconds for each killed enemy.

474
01:19:23,029 --> 01:19:32,840
That feels great. It's that one, right? It has to be. Yeah, that thing's amazing. Every time you

475
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:46,869
kill something for five seconds, up to 50%. Is there an indicator where I can see it? Oh, it's

476
01:19:46,869 --> 01:19:56,380
up here on the right. Oh, I need more damage because I'm not killing things fast enough.

477
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:10,649
Attack speed. Will you ever do a second run of choose your own Diablo in Diablo? Sorry,

478
01:20:10,649 --> 01:20:15,659
hold on. That was pretty fun. Hardcore where you guys pick there at every point I put in

479
01:20:17,579 --> 01:20:44,899
with D2 remastered. That's much, much easier to do now. Boy, this might be bad. Oh, come on.

480
01:20:44,899 --> 01:20:51,510
Damn it. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. I never got the key to that cage. Okay.

481
01:20:52,310 --> 01:21:03,510
I got money. How much do I have? I got, oh my God, I have tons of money. I have 4,300 gold.

482
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:13,689
Maybe defense. Max health defense. Try to get it to last a little longer. Pack range.

483
01:21:14,329 --> 01:21:23,739
I'm going to say this one. Let's do area and projectile speed. That's not what that said.

484
01:21:27,029 --> 01:21:47,899
24% bigger projectile. I think that's pretty good. All right, let's go. All right. I'm going to go

485
01:21:47,899 --> 01:21:58,739
rescue that guy in the cage. Don't skip plus one piercing. Yeah, we were talking about Diablo. That's

486
01:21:58,739 --> 01:22:15,539
my bad. Oh yeah. We were talking about gems. We were talking about gems, gems, gems. Let's talk

487
01:22:15,539 --> 01:22:24,310
about gems. I remember when you start D2, it's just you're going to use your gems. You're going

488
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:30,789
to put the flawed topaz in this busted up piece of shit, one-handed acts you found and you're going

489
01:22:30,789 --> 01:22:38,630
to get a little bit of lightning damage and you're going to notice it. Here we go again.

490
01:22:43,430 --> 01:22:49,350
Oh, okay. All right. Give me another topic. Give me another topic. Give me another topic. Geez,

491
01:22:49,350 --> 01:22:54,600
man. You're still on. It's been like an hour. What do you want to talk about? Talk about Wendy's?

492
01:22:55,239 --> 01:23:13,399
I like their nuggets. What's the best jam for peanut butter? That would be grape jelly or

493
01:23:13,399 --> 01:23:22,260
grape jam. In fact, I haven't had it in a long time, but they make this product

494
01:23:22,819 --> 01:23:31,500
where it's this weird spiral of 50-50 peanut butter and grape jam inside the same container.

495
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:38,199
And there was a point when I was eating that shit out of the jar. I was eating it out of the jar

496
01:23:38,199 --> 01:23:43,579
for like 30 straight minutes and I realized what was going on and I had to stop it.

497
01:23:43,579 --> 01:23:55,020
Goobers. Yeah. N.A. food. N.A. food. All right. Yeah. Well, hey, how can you take your crisps and

498
01:23:55,020 --> 01:24:13,750
get the fuck out of here? All right. I'm going to eat Goobers out of the jar. Okay.

499
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:36,810
He's really patriotic today. Uh, I've ran. I've just we've I've just discussed Diablo

500
01:24:36,810 --> 01:24:41,050
two's item system and I eat peanut butter out of the jar. Does that make me an American?

501
01:24:41,689 --> 01:24:45,930
Is that an American thing? Is that patriotism? Is that patriotic?

502
01:24:49,029 --> 01:24:55,420
Let me tell you something about Diablo. Hey, give me that jar of peanut butter while I go over this.

503
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:30,810
What's some good British food? Beans, right? Nothing. The only thing I think of when I think

504
01:25:30,810 --> 01:25:38,409
of British food is just like two big fucking sausages on a plate with a bunch of plain beans

505
01:25:38,409 --> 01:25:46,300
on it. And like, that's it. That's like what I think of. But I would eat that. That sounds

506
01:25:46,300 --> 01:25:52,739
pretty damn good. Like, that's fine. I would be okay with that. That's this is not an insult to

507
01:25:52,739 --> 01:25:58,260
an entire country of people's food. No, I'm just I'm that's what I think of. I think of like two big

508
01:25:58,260 --> 01:26:09,300
sausages and like plain beans and I think a toast plain toast that that that sounds pretty good to

509
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:22,100
me. Remember the cage. Right. Right. Right. I get it. I get it. I get it. Scones. All right. Who has

510
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:42,760
the best desserts? Who has the best desserts? France. France has the best desserts. I would say

511
01:26:42,760 --> 01:27:08,229
I would say Italy. No, no, no, no. America and Mexico. Yeah. I mean, I I'm trying to think of

512
01:27:08,229 --> 01:27:12,869
what my like really favorite desserts are. And they are kind of American. Unless like where did

513
01:27:13,750 --> 01:27:19,960
like banana cream pie, for instance, who made that up? Where did who made the first banana

514
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:38,859
cream pie? Who did that? Who? What country did it originate from? That's your go to dessert. I love

515
01:27:38,859 --> 01:27:45,909
banana banana cream pie and banana pudding are two of my top desserts ever. And those of you that oh

516
01:27:45,909 --> 01:27:52,390
my god, are you 80? Oh, yeah. Slurp up the banana pudding, right? Oh, man. No, you you've never

517
01:27:52,390 --> 01:27:57,029
eaten it. You've seen a bunch of old people eat it and you laugh at them. But go eat it. Eat it next

518
01:27:57,029 --> 01:28:05,510
time. And then you then you come back and talk. I know I walked by the guy in the cage, but I really

519
01:28:05,510 --> 01:28:13,340
want I want the abilities first. I believe to have originated in the Midwest of the United States.

520
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:23,109
OK, so that's American. It's great, too. Oh, what else? I mean, like ice cream. I love ice cream.

521
01:28:23,909 --> 01:28:32,569
Who doesn't, though? And who even made up ice cream? Anybody even know what ice cream be?

522
01:28:32,569 --> 01:28:50,180
Where was where was ice cream invented? China, ancient Chinese planted the first seeds of

523
01:28:50,180 --> 01:29:07,479
modern day ice cream. OK, 600 A.D. in China. I love ice cream. All right, let's go collect and

524
01:29:07,479 --> 01:29:25,319
then I'll get this archman and then we'll go get I have 28 health. What happened? Ice cream. What

525
01:29:25,319 --> 01:29:37,800
else? What else is like another thing up there in a cream pie? Just like a good chocolate ice cream.

526
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:46,140
All right, I'm going to go this way here. Tiramisu Tiramisu is really good, but I don't know if I

527
01:29:46,140 --> 01:30:00,600
would say Tiramisu is my is my favorite dessert. OK, that's like the thing in vampire survivors.

528
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:12,500
Oh, speed. What is this gigantic pickup range? This is ridiculous. Oh, my God. I want region.

529
01:30:13,220 --> 01:30:37,260
Oh, that sucks. Oh, that sucks. That sucks. That's hard. Oh, I got a blessing. Health. OK,

530
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:42,300
all right. Now I'm going to open. I'll open that cage now. I'm going to go with melee.

531
01:30:42,300 --> 01:31:00,149
You suck at this. That's fine. That's fine. I don't care. Defense. Health regen. Wait, I want

532
01:31:03,739 --> 01:31:19,579
much more of that. All right, let's go. Area size is really good. Yeah, I need to do cone size.

533
01:31:19,579 --> 01:31:23,640
First of all, let me go talk to the guy. Let me do the actual mission.

534
01:31:28,119 --> 01:31:48,140
What instrument is that? The thing that goes. What is that thing? I want more regen. I want to be.

535
01:31:48,140 --> 01:31:52,140
I want to be regening like one health, two health a second.

536
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:54,420
We're going to work on that first while it's easy.

537
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:20,970
OK, let's get this done immediately. Don't free him. Keep him there. What's with you? What's with

538
01:32:20,970 --> 01:32:29,560
you? I think having more than four or five slots for gems in Diablo three and Diablo two is like

539
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:35,500
probably the best part about having the gem system. And I'm kidding. I'm not. I got you.

540
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:48,380
Got you. Got you. Got you. But no, seriously, like I'll seriously the one to two slots per

541
01:32:49,180 --> 01:32:53,180
it's just you've designed it in a way to make it so it can never be interesting.

542
01:32:53,819 --> 01:32:58,779
It has to be this this this calculated thing that you've done where you can have one thing put in

543
01:32:58,779 --> 01:33:05,619
this very specific box of randomness. I want to be able to throw six perfect fucking topazes

544
01:33:05,619 --> 01:33:11,539
into a weapon and waste it and be an idiot. I want six perfect emeralds and a shitty sword

545
01:33:11,539 --> 01:33:15,460
with 600 poison damage over fucking 12 seconds. And I want my friends to make fun of me because

546
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:34,680
I did that. When I got it, I got the six gems in that thing. Rattle, rattle, rattle. No one cares.

547
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:42,199
Yeah, they do. I think a lot of people care. I think a very large amount of people care.

548
01:33:48,810 --> 01:34:00,060
Hey, and it's my stream. So I'm going to talk about Diablo 2 gems. OK, so

549
01:34:02,729 --> 01:34:13,060
will he just be at the town? Dude, will you please read the nice comments? I'm a streamer.

550
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:16,420
I'm immune to those. I only read the ones that say like, hey, dude, like, when are you going to

551
01:34:16,420 --> 01:34:29,930
put a baseball of your ass? God damn it. I had so much help there, too. All right. Cone size.

552
01:34:29,930 --> 01:34:50,069
There it is. Finally. There's a lot. There's like two or three levels right here. Come on.

553
01:34:50,779 --> 01:35:12,649
There we go. I leveled up twice. Range and crit. Yep. Damage and attack speed, probably. Yeah.

554
01:35:12,649 --> 01:35:16,569
Banana ripeness chart. What do you like your banana? All right, hold on. I let me actually

555
01:35:16,569 --> 01:35:20,329
get it like a decent run and then we'll go over the banana ripeness because it's very specific

556
01:35:20,329 --> 01:35:25,300
for me because it depends on what you're doing with it. Is this is this going into a smoothie?

557
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:33,899
Are you eating this? Is this being put on cereal? It's very important that we go over that. I want

558
01:35:33,899 --> 01:35:48,949
more defense and health. What keeps killing me every time? Crit damage. It barely hurt this guy.

559
01:35:49,590 --> 01:36:26,100
We try to burn him. Oh, that was an unbelievable amount of damage. All right. So ripeness or a

560
01:36:26,100 --> 01:36:34,140
smoothie. I want that shit right before it's rotten. I want an overripe banana to be a good

561
01:36:34,140 --> 01:36:40,199
sweetener or a smoothie. How do you think about that? Yeah, I've got hold on. I've currently got

562
01:36:40,199 --> 01:36:53,989
Tom Hanks voice. Let me hold on. If I want it really sweet, I would say like a little bit before

563
01:36:53,989 --> 01:36:57,590
being overripe is the best place to put it in a smoothie. But sometimes you really want it to

564
01:36:57,590 --> 01:37:04,470
have that really like sugary sugariness. That's disgusting. Whatever. You don't have to eat it,

565
01:37:05,029 --> 01:37:10,520
but not okay. Is there peanut butter in it? If it's a peanut butter banana smoothie,

566
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:13,399
then I don't want the bananas to be very ripe because I don't want them to overpower the

567
01:37:13,399 --> 01:37:16,520
peanut butter flavor. But then I don't want to use too much peanut butter because I don't actually

568
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:20,439
want to overpower the banana flavor with the peanut butter. It's a very, very, very hard

569
01:37:20,439 --> 01:37:43,460
balance to get. I'm going all health. That was a really bad idea. I'll be all right. But all

570
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:49,060
seriously though. Yeah. I like a ripe banana for a smoothie. I like a non-ripe, just kind of right

571
01:37:49,060 --> 01:37:55,689
in the middle. I'm just going to eat it. I do like bananas. I don't know what I just got, but I think

572
01:37:55,689 --> 01:38:08,619
I can. Okay. I don't know what I'm, I don't know what's going on. Oh, it's like super speed. I just

573
01:38:08,619 --> 01:38:15,779
can't kill anything. All right. Damage is a damage is immediate. I need it right now.

574
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:54,899
This guy's been walking around for 10 straight minutes. Shit. Shit. Cone size. All right. You

575
01:38:54,899 --> 01:39:00,890
have to die. I have to get at least this one boss down, right? Or can I really say I'm a video game

576
01:39:00,890 --> 01:39:08,069
player? There we go. Okay. I hope I'm not instantly dead, but I'm going to do arcane splinters because

577
01:39:08,069 --> 01:39:23,060
we haven't seen it. What are your thoughts on Twitter being called X? I don't care. I use that

578
01:39:23,060 --> 01:39:39,050
app like once a month. Uh, okay. What about this one here? I don't like the projectile size

579
01:39:39,050 --> 01:39:54,819
reduction. I'll take it. All right. What does it do? They stay. Ooh, they, I think they, yeah,

580
01:39:54,819 --> 01:39:58,979
they're still doing damage when they stay. All right. I don't want to lose this because

581
01:39:58,979 --> 01:40:04,470
this has, I have an opportunity here to do pretty good. Let's regen a little. Don't get hurt.

582
01:40:05,029 --> 01:40:12,279
Go get the other parchment. This is where it always goes to shit. I'd like the, okay. I'm dead.

583
01:40:14,359 --> 01:40:21,739
Oh, that was fun. All right. I got the wellkeeper now. What does he do?

584
01:40:21,739 --> 01:40:32,600
All right. What's up with you? Wellkeeper. You've earned my deepest gratitude for the rescue,

585
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:38,699
of course. And since we've made such a great team down there, I have a proposition for you.

586
01:40:38,699 --> 01:40:46,180
Okay. I had a dream where you made fun of my chat message and literally made chat bully me.

587
01:40:52,199 --> 01:40:57,720
Well, has dried up a long time ago. Now it leads to the very halls. You helped me escape.

588
01:40:57,720 --> 01:41:01,640
Are you waiting to fall breakfast? Make sure you eat a full breakfast in the morning.

589
01:41:04,279 --> 01:41:05,720
All right. I need to pay attention. What does this say?

590
01:41:10,569 --> 01:41:14,739
This well has dried up long time ago. Now it leads to the very halls. You helped me escape.

591
01:41:14,739 --> 01:41:23,430
But if you ever happened to find the other end, you might want to drop a trinket into the bucket.

592
01:41:23,430 --> 01:41:39,300
Oh, whoa. I can just put these on. I have an entire stash of items that I just wasn't wearing.

593
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:54,090
Do I have to buy these? Wait, 10% health, free defense, 15% movement speed, 20% attack speed,

594
01:41:54,090 --> 01:42:06,279
a shitload. Okay. Well, it says you own them. Attack speed, 10% more health and defense.

595
01:42:06,279 --> 01:42:16,520
All right. This is really cool. Are there rarities? Are there uniques in this game?

596
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:37,619
Jeremy, your webcam is on and your balls are out. Whatever. I don't care. You have a ring too. Do I?

597
01:42:37,619 --> 01:42:50,949
Oh, it's actually on the character too. Or am I making that up? I don't think I

598
01:42:50,949 --> 01:42:55,369
got out with it. You can buy new items from the well keep it once you've retrieved them

599
01:42:55,369 --> 01:43:02,260
through the well. So there's something down there where I can put items up there.

600
01:43:02,260 --> 01:43:11,829
There are kids here. What are you doing? They really shouldn't be. It just shouldn't be.

601
01:43:11,829 --> 01:43:28,470
It really shouldn't be at all. Okay. Here we go. I'm going to try to get a full run Haunted Caverns.

602
01:43:28,470 --> 01:43:33,979
Adults only. I mean, you know, I've had the mature audience filter on this stream for like

603
01:43:33,979 --> 01:43:42,779
eight years. I just never turned it off because I mean we talk about kind of weird shit on this

604
01:43:42,779 --> 01:43:57,430
stream. All right. Right off the bat. Huge deal. It's not working clearly. It's not working.

605
01:43:57,430 --> 01:44:08,149
It's not working. Bananas are adult content only. Yeah. You guys missed it. We just talked about.

606
01:44:08,149 --> 01:44:24,119
We just talked about bananas for at least 10 straight minutes. Damage. Damage. Damage. Damage.

607
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:33,140
Damage. I it took me 10 minutes to get to 104 last time. I want to be doing 200 damage before

608
01:44:33,140 --> 01:45:05,479
that first boss shows up. More. Here we go. This is the one. It actually might be because

609
01:45:06,199 --> 01:45:12,170
I've leveled up like three times in 25 seconds. All right. Attack speed. We're going for damage

610
01:45:12,170 --> 01:45:25,770
only. Already at 228 crits. Might as well just might as well just sign the paperwork now.

611
01:45:26,729 --> 01:45:50,010
This is this was this is a done deal. Good. Look at that. Already got a cone with already. But wait

612
01:45:50,010 --> 01:46:19,699
cone or crit? Which one? Cat ages in dog years. Cone omega lol. Everybody said cone. I was going

613
01:46:19,699 --> 01:46:32,409
to pick cone too. So that's what I've decided. I'm getting a lot better at actually physically

614
01:46:32,409 --> 01:46:43,800
clearing, which is what I really should be doing. 10 percent damage. Yep. I have to go. I got to go

615
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:52,409
for it. These guys take two hits and I try to get them down to take like one. I already took

616
01:46:52,409 --> 01:47:08,199
damage. You might as well just fucking uninstall the fucking goddamn game. Dude, chill. I'm fine.

617
01:47:10,199 --> 01:47:16,359
Range or health? Let's go. No, we're going damage. All right, let's get let's kill this guy quick.

618
01:47:16,359 --> 01:47:37,819
Don't let him just walk around for 15 minutes. There's the well. You can tell he's mad. I'm

619
01:47:37,819 --> 01:47:53,210
really not. I'm just messing around already. OK, already got the first item. Phantom needles. Let's

620
01:47:53,210 --> 01:47:58,279
go. That's a good thing for May Lake because it just kind of randomly hits stuff around me.

621
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:18,760
Yeah. All right, give me an item so I can drop it in the well. When are you when are you going to

622
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:30,539
play POE on stream? I don't know. I don't think I might not. I mean, maybe me and stir would play

623
01:48:30,539 --> 01:48:34,140
it just to mess around for like an afternoon or something. But that's an off stream game for me.

624
01:48:34,140 --> 01:48:45,930
I mean, I mean, no, not necessarily. I mean, with the kind of direction that I was telling you guys

625
01:48:45,930 --> 01:48:50,279
about with the channel and everything and more of these streams where I'm just kind of hanging

626
01:48:50,279 --> 01:48:55,899
around, nothing too crazy going on, just chilling. Maybe I would just play POE and just do runs or

627
01:48:55,899 --> 01:49:11,479
something. There it is. Is the cone size thing a joke or doesn't actually kind of doesn't feel

628
01:49:11,479 --> 01:49:32,520
like it because I'm killing things a lot faster now. A slime rancher. No, you silly Billy. You

629
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:40,460
play more roadblocks. I think I'm trying to set up a MVM. I've got five people that are

630
01:49:41,260 --> 01:49:46,920
willing to do MVM. I think that'd be really fun. Also, I want to open some crates too.

631
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:57,829
I just have a bunch of different cases from the last six or seven years just sitting in my backpack

632
01:49:57,829 --> 01:50:06,390
and I just don't really know what to do with them. I don't want to do something like an egregious

633
01:50:06,390 --> 01:50:25,539
amount, right? But I'll be like 20 open up like 10 to 25 cases or something. Open a case after

634
01:50:25,619 --> 01:50:38,810
every death. That would get a little ridiculous, I think. Attack speed or crit or maybe pickup

635
01:50:38,810 --> 01:50:57,500
range. Attack speed. Yeah, I was thinking movement speed, but it's just low. Six percent's not very

636
01:50:57,500 --> 01:51:34,199
much. All right, I'm doing a lot better now. Decision time. That's big. This is also big.

637
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:48,420
They're all big. I really actually don't know. They're all good. Cone width or speed and damage.

638
01:51:48,420 --> 01:52:10,739
Always damage. Yeah, that's true. First boss should be coming any second now. Did you get

639
01:52:10,739 --> 01:52:17,420
the well guy? Yes. I don't have any items to put into the well though. So if I put items into the

640
01:52:17,420 --> 01:52:24,090
well do they go away for this run? I feel like you just immediately deposit any item you find

641
01:52:24,090 --> 01:52:42,010
regardless of if it's better. Yeah, defense and crit damage. I'm killing this guy so much faster

642
01:52:42,010 --> 01:52:56,520
than the last like five attempts. Oh, that's the well. Okay, I just like walked into it.

643
01:52:57,319 --> 01:53:28,300
Well, we might be depositing something right now. Oh, shit. What is it? Ooh. Ooh.

644
01:53:31,909 --> 01:53:46,710
Critical strike damage by 40 percent. We're dropping that into the well. Uh-huh. What is

645
01:53:46,710 --> 01:54:08,340
the thing in the top right? What is that? Is that the kind of attract thing? Cone size. That's my

646
01:54:08,340 --> 01:54:13,430
health. That's a magnet. Should I make my way up there or should I get the... No, I'll get the

647
01:54:13,430 --> 01:54:33,739
parchment first. I have to buy that item from the vendor. My pickup range is so bad. Let's get an

648
01:54:33,739 --> 01:54:50,329
ability. I don't have one yet and it's been like eight minutes plus 10% additional attacks. Oh,

649
01:54:50,329 --> 01:55:18,039
yeah. Double hits. Sing, bro. Bro, sing. I want everyone to just relax for a sec because I've got

650
01:55:18,039 --> 01:55:24,539
something to tell you. We have officially confirmed, officially, that that hit sound,

651
01:55:25,880 --> 01:55:32,680
the needles that are going out. Officially confirmed. That is the plants versus zombies

652
01:55:32,680 --> 01:55:50,229
pellet hitting a zombie that has a bucket on their head. Sound effect. That has been officially not

653
01:55:50,229 --> 01:56:18,760
confirmed by anybody but me. The projectiles are absolutely killer. It's killer. Damage again.

654
01:56:19,720 --> 01:56:43,689
All right. I don't want to get... Hold on. There's so much EXP here. Damage. There's so much EXP. I

655
01:56:43,689 --> 01:56:51,130
have to just leave it. I'll wrap around. Oh, my goodness. I think this is invulnerability.

656
01:56:51,930 --> 01:57:16,180
Give me this. Shit. Shit. Are you an archer or kind of a barbarian kind of guy? I am more of a

657
01:57:16,180 --> 01:57:41,770
ranged damage kind of fan but I do like melee characters. All right. I'm leaving. Another

658
01:57:41,770 --> 01:57:59,770
centrist take. Add it to the list. Another centrist take from German985. Fucking Sag.

659
01:58:02,380 --> 01:58:15,590
Ooh. Is that good? I don't know if that's even good on this character. I mean, I already pierced

660
01:58:15,590 --> 01:58:24,010
with my weapon, right? Or does that work for the ability too? It's only for the ability. Ooh.

661
01:58:24,649 --> 01:58:42,060
Maybe it is good. It is going through them now. Cool. What did this guy do to piss off so many

662
01:58:42,060 --> 01:58:50,659
skeletons? You know, I thought about this the other day. Have we talked about this? The prospect of

663
01:58:51,619 --> 01:58:56,579
the bandits. Look out, adventurer. Make sure to kill the bandits that are surrounding us.

664
01:58:57,380 --> 01:59:02,579
There are like 70,000 fucking bandits in every video game and like 12 people that live in the

665
01:59:02,579 --> 01:59:09,770
town. What's going on here? There are more bandits than people that live in any of these towns like

666
01:59:09,770 --> 01:59:27,939
times a hundred. At some point, are they bandits or is that just the entire human population outside?

667
01:59:27,939 --> 01:59:39,609
Oh, a pack of bandits. It's around our camp. It's me. You. That lady over there. In a healing well.

668
01:59:39,609 --> 01:59:47,670
Adventurer, go out and stop the encroaching bandits. It's about as big as a small country's

669
01:59:47,670 --> 01:59:57,609
worth of people out there. They definitely could have taken that over 100%. Like in D2, if they

670
01:59:57,609 --> 02:00:05,850
just like rushed the rogue encampment, we're all dead. They just they've never tried. Do you wear

671
02:00:05,850 --> 02:00:41,909
a wig? No. Yeah, there's a lot of skeletons too. A lot of demons. I think this is an automatic. I

672
02:00:41,909 --> 02:00:52,300
mean, but this one's good too, though. 10% damage and 10% attack speed is you can't pick anything

673
02:00:52,300 --> 02:01:11,420
else if it's here. You just can't. All right. I think a boss is incoming here. Yep. Remember this

674
02:01:11,420 --> 02:01:31,430
part. Not so tough now, are you? Speed. All right. I don't get cocky because this is the furthest I've

675
02:01:31,430 --> 02:01:55,720
ever gotten. Geez. Lightning strike here. Maybe orbs. I have piercing. I don't think this is. I

676
02:01:55,720 --> 02:02:11,899
should do the blades if I have piercing, right? Always orb. Really? Even with piercing. I'm going

677
02:02:11,899 --> 02:02:28,340
with blades. I think the piercing is going to be good. I need to pick up this shit so bad.

678
02:02:28,979 --> 02:02:57,880
There's so much on the ground. Let me pull everybody over here. OK, health and defense. Whoa.

679
02:02:59,399 --> 02:03:12,010
I'm fine. I need that thing. That thing that sucks everything to me. I would level up like five times.

680
02:03:12,569 --> 02:03:35,909
God damn it. Come on. I was really, really stupid, but I got a bunch of experience. Additional

681
02:03:35,909 --> 02:03:50,819
attacks or health. I had to do it. Point one additional attacks or the movement speed

682
02:03:50,819 --> 02:03:58,340
or health. What the fuck is he doing? I had to go through there because I had to get the item.

683
02:03:59,930 --> 02:04:06,149
Bro, this is boring. Play Persona 4. You're not going to start an account where every day you're

684
02:04:06,149 --> 02:04:10,789
going to say, hey, please, Jerma, please. This is day 50 of Persona 4. Let me help you again.

685
02:04:10,789 --> 02:04:23,050
I probably won't play that ever. So don't make one of those. Persona 4 is good. I know. I'm going

686
02:04:23,050 --> 02:04:32,939
with the health. It might be stupid, but I don't care. I want to live. Did I tell you guys that I

687
02:04:32,939 --> 02:04:38,699
it was like, oh, man, Persona. Persona is such an awesome series. Just try it. And I like I don't

688
02:04:38,699 --> 02:04:43,979
know. I downloaded one of them. It was like Persona 5, but not the actual fucking Persona 5 video game,

689
02:04:43,979 --> 02:04:50,220
I guess. It was like, hey, this is like not Persona 5, but it's like Persona 5, but it's not that game.

690
02:04:50,220 --> 02:05:23,140
I don't know what I did. Additional attacks. You need to focus. Yes, I do. Thank you. There it is.

691
02:05:24,149 --> 02:06:13,779
Yay. There's so much over here. I got it. Low 30 damage. Go on. Let me kill the second boss.

692
02:06:18,489 --> 02:06:33,020
I got him. Block strength, health or probably this one, right? And then deposit this immediately.

693
02:06:34,710 --> 02:06:44,300
Go get the magnet now. I don't have any helmets. He's a terrible. I mean, I don't have any helmets

694
02:06:44,300 --> 02:06:53,779
though, do I? Defense, block strength. Yeah, I'm going with health. I already have this one.

695
02:06:54,020 --> 02:07:04,420
A magnet just dropped nearby. Really? Oh my goodness. It did. You're right. You're right.

696
02:07:04,420 --> 02:07:15,979
Let me go get it. You can only use the well once per run. Oh, all right. Well, let's level up like

697
02:07:15,979 --> 02:07:37,380
15 times more cone size, uh, attack speed, uh, piercing and okay. This is a way. There's a,

698
02:07:37,380 --> 02:07:44,500
there's a lot of shit up here. Hold on. Okay. All right. All right. Now I'm going to give me

699
02:07:44,500 --> 02:08:02,220
the scroll. Oh shit. It's getting hairy. I'm about, I'm hitting the limit here of my character's

700
02:08:02,220 --> 02:08:27,560
strength versus the difficulty of the level. I have a lot of money though. Get the scroll.

701
02:08:27,560 --> 02:08:35,340
I know I'm going, I'm going. Look at all that XP. I'm going to make my way back up to get it all.

702
02:08:35,340 --> 02:08:54,859
I'm going to sneeze. I think I apologize in advance. I cannot hit the mute button because

703
02:08:54,859 --> 02:08:57,930
well, actually I could pause it, but I don't want to lose the rhythm.

704
02:08:57,930 --> 02:09:24,060
Oh, well, geez, there it is. 5,000 in one run. Just do it already. Come on. Damage.

705
02:09:26,470 --> 02:09:36,300
Ooh. I maxed out the strength thing. This would be great if I, if I could win right now,

706
02:09:36,300 --> 02:09:45,819
that'd be awesome. Oh, you're a guardian of the parchment. I can get two of these.

707
02:09:47,529 --> 02:09:53,720
Well, might as well get all three of them. I get the orbs. Oh, this is the end. Yep. Maybe not.

708
02:09:54,439 --> 02:10:16,119
Jesus. Oh, that's yeah. I don't think so. I don't think so, but I'll try.

709
02:10:26,409 --> 02:10:52,090
It's not too bad. I had to tank it for that money. 6K. Can I get to 10K?

710
02:10:57,350 --> 02:11:19,189
Give me the pickup range because I'm definitely going to die soon. Hey, how's the bit rate over

711
02:11:19,189 --> 02:11:24,470
there in a streamer video on demand land? How was it over there guys? How do you feel? How's it going?

712
02:11:24,470 --> 02:11:57,460
It's pretty good. Really? No, no, no. That's it. Let me get one more level. Nice. Okay. Phantom

713
02:11:57,460 --> 02:12:05,880
Rift again. Yeah. Wait, what did that do? Oh, I can't have two. I don't know what I just did.

714
02:12:05,880 --> 02:12:13,979
Why do you hate Persona 4? I don't. It's a really fun game. I just feel like that game takes a long

715
02:12:13,979 --> 02:12:24,140
time to play. Correct choice, but read it next time. Oh, it adds one projectile. Okay, cool.

716
02:12:24,140 --> 02:12:27,899
I'm just going with health and defense now to try to live because I'm actually might be able to do

717
02:12:27,899 --> 02:13:10,869
it. Maybe not. Weird pattern. Okay. Health, right? That's ridiculous. I'm just going to try to get the

718
02:13:13,109 --> 02:13:34,859
magnet thing. If I get health along the way, that's great. No, no, no, no, no. This is bad.

719
02:13:35,899 --> 02:14:00,520
I got a turkey though. That's okay. Come on. Give me another level so I can get health. Health? Shit.

720
02:14:00,520 --> 02:14:15,539
Movement speed. Is there going to be health in here? Good. I only got eight minutes left

721
02:14:15,539 --> 02:14:30,899
and that's a full run done. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Bad. Oh,

722
02:14:30,899 --> 02:14:54,630
boy. Oh, boy. Oh, I made a lot of, look at all this. I unlocked a lot of stuff. I unlocked an

723
02:14:54,630 --> 02:15:12,390
upgrade. Necromancer. Cool. I got to do blessing for. Oh, I'm unlocking things to upgrade.

724
02:15:12,390 --> 02:15:23,140
Interesting. Wait, didn't I have 6,000 gold? Didn't I have 6,000? Where's this 3,000 come from?

725
02:15:24,680 --> 02:15:50,420
That was kills though. 2,500 gold? What? That's my entire bank account. I think I'm going to get

726
02:15:50,420 --> 02:16:00,859
the pickup range. That's pretty good. Completed quest, increase XP gain. I'll try ranged.

727
02:16:00,859 --> 02:16:11,819
Attention streamer, please play Pikmin 4. Um, I don't know. Maybe. Maybe one day. What's the

728
02:16:11,819 --> 02:16:20,460
goal now? What am I trying to do? Defeat the lich. That's probably the last boss that I just saw.

729
02:16:21,880 --> 02:16:39,620
Uh, deal 750,000 damage. This is not in one run, so just total. Kill 50,000 slimes. All right,

730
02:16:39,620 --> 02:16:53,510
so we need to do astronomer's orb. All right, I want to do astronomer's orb. Let's do it. Okay,

731
02:16:53,510 --> 02:17:04,250
cool. Ever considered disco, uh, elcium? I've considered it, but I have not played it. All right,

732
02:17:04,250 --> 02:17:15,719
where's the strength? Did I unlock one of these damage? All right, that's a big deal. That's a

733
02:17:15,719 --> 02:17:31,340
big deal. 10%, 20%. Wait, let me get rid of some of the... I'm not getting diminishing returns for

734
02:17:31,340 --> 02:17:39,260
this, right? Just like vampire sparrers, because give me the 20% damage. Give me the 20% damage in

735
02:17:39,260 --> 02:17:59,180
the health regen. This is going to be fun. Let me take a sip. Max out health regen. That's a good

736
02:17:59,180 --> 02:18:14,170
idea. Actually a good idea. Maybe I'll do that now. Oh, that's some good cider. I came pretty

737
02:18:14,170 --> 02:18:18,170
close with the melee character. Let's see if I can do it with the ranged character, especially

738
02:18:18,170 --> 02:18:23,129
with that 20% damage. Look at that. I'm killing skeletons in one hit. That wasn't happening

739
02:18:23,129 --> 02:18:30,309
before. Well is right here. Already level one. Health regen. Let's go. Let's do it.

740
02:18:30,309 --> 02:18:54,649
Look at this piercing damage. Attack speed already. Good start. Get the scrolls early, man. Yeah,

741
02:18:54,649 --> 02:19:07,700
that's a good call. That's a good call. I'm gonna go get it right now. You always should be making

742
02:19:07,700 --> 02:19:16,600
your way down that way in the first minute or so, right? What are your theories of the lore of the

743
02:19:16,600 --> 02:19:23,540
game? I don't know. There's just a lot of dead people. These skeletons were once a person.

744
02:19:24,180 --> 02:19:46,120
That was 9% movement speed. It's worth it. Probably more than one person died. Yeah,

745
02:19:46,920 --> 02:20:27,770
probably. I need to wash my eyes. You need to wash your eyes. It's apparently estimated that

746
02:20:27,770 --> 02:20:35,110
about 117 billion people have ever been born. So is that why they're all outside the Rogan

747
02:20:35,110 --> 02:21:04,090
cabin? Yep. Shit, I didn't want to knock that over. I want to leave those. Get an item right now.

748
02:21:04,090 --> 02:21:27,159
Oh, I've got 20% more damage to close enemies. You know that more than one person has been born

749
02:21:27,159 --> 02:21:40,899
today. It's kind of wild. All right. I said orbs, but there's no orbs here. So we're gonna have to

750
02:21:40,899 --> 02:21:51,020
go with the needles. I feel like I've written something down that I really wanted to go over

751
02:21:51,020 --> 02:22:10,379
today. I forget what it was. I was like, I have to talk about this someday. What was it? Okay.

752
02:22:10,379 --> 02:22:19,750
All right. All right. So you know, like the fart sound effects sounds, you know, we all know the

753
02:22:19,750 --> 02:22:29,610
ones like that. A fart sound effect. Don't you think it's kind of ridiculous that those may

754
02:22:29,610 --> 02:22:37,350
have been recorded like 20 or 30 years ago? Somebody farted into a mic and it's been used

755
02:22:37,350 --> 02:22:44,920
for 30 fucking years. Imagine being that guy or being that guy's kids. And it's like, yeah,

756
02:22:44,920 --> 02:22:52,389
that's that's me up there. I'm I farted into a mic 25 years ago and it's just it's everywhere.

757
02:22:52,950 --> 02:23:04,489
How would you feel about that? Imagine like you're just like watching a movie or something and you

758
02:23:04,489 --> 02:23:12,620
hear your fart. You farted. Is it embarrassing or is it like, yep, I get a lot of those residuals

759
02:23:12,620 --> 02:23:19,799
for the fart sounds I did. Yeah, I recorded 20 of them and they're all used and they use the same

760
02:23:19,799 --> 02:23:29,430
ones from like the same library for the last 30 years. But how does how does that guy feel

761
02:23:29,510 --> 02:23:49,110
now that he's like 60? I don't know. That's a lot of damage. A thousand people just left.

762
02:23:50,329 --> 02:24:14,440
They're obviously not strong enough. Fart royalties. Yeah, that me and Holly were

763
02:24:14,440 --> 02:24:20,780
just sitting there and it's just like, yeah, like we just heard that fart sound. That guy

764
02:24:20,780 --> 02:24:27,979
did somebody had to have done that. You think that somebody I saw somebody say that they

765
02:24:27,979 --> 02:24:32,700
think it was a mouth somebody could do. I don't think so. Some of those are very, very real.

766
02:24:41,639 --> 02:24:47,100
I don't know why I just picture and I don't know. You can think I'm looking stupid for this. I just

767
02:24:47,500 --> 02:24:52,950
see some guy just like, hey, yeah, Bill, we need like we need a fart sound. I guess

768
02:24:53,590 --> 02:24:56,870
I'm just imagining the guy taking this and it's like a standard microphone,

769
02:24:56,870 --> 02:25:01,909
the type of microphone that it's got a long cable connected long. It's about at least 10 to 15 feet

770
02:25:01,909 --> 02:25:07,639
long and it's plugged in somewhere and it's got that metal top like a stand up routine.

771
02:25:07,639 --> 02:25:11,909
And the guy just puts it like right between his cheeks and just parts right into it.

772
02:25:11,909 --> 02:25:19,340
These things, he like presses it up there. That's what I see. 18 plus stream. It's been there for

773
02:25:19,340 --> 02:25:26,870
seven or eight years. Okay. That warning has been here for no way. Get the kids out of here.

774
02:25:26,870 --> 02:25:29,829
Get the kids out of here. They never should have been here. They shouldn't be here. Get the kids

775
02:25:29,829 --> 02:25:57,379
out of here. Kids. This is no longer a kid friendly discussion. Your viewers are increasing. Carry on.

776
02:26:02,889 --> 02:26:13,540
I'll take that. And don't you think that the audio engineer after bill like

777
02:26:13,540 --> 02:26:18,260
put the mic right up to where his ass is and did it and it ripped it. It was just awful.

778
02:26:18,340 --> 02:26:22,659
Do you think he's like, Hey Bill, that was fucking rancid. We should do another one,

779
02:26:22,659 --> 02:26:26,420
but this time don't put the microphone like up to your asshole. You should probably do it

780
02:26:26,420 --> 02:26:36,969
a little further away because that was fucking disgusting. I imagine just having two headphones

781
02:26:36,969 --> 02:26:40,729
on just sitting there and it's like, yeah, I don't know if we can, I don't think we should

782
02:26:40,729 --> 02:26:57,620
put that one in. You know what I'm talking about though. All you, all that matters is at least 10

783
02:26:57,620 --> 02:27:02,739
of you get it. You know what I mean? There's like, there's like 13, 14,000 people here right now.

784
02:27:02,739 --> 02:27:06,920
As long as 10 of you understand what I mean by this and like, you get it, then I'm good.

785
02:27:06,920 --> 02:27:20,340
Then we're good. I'm okay with getting the question marks from like 10 plus thousand people. As long

786
02:27:20,340 --> 02:27:26,979
as I know, like six of you are like, yup, I see it. I know what he's, I know what's going on here.

787
02:27:26,979 --> 02:27:43,590
I get it. Lower the bar. Yeah. Well, that's how I make myself feel better, right? I don't care what

788
02:27:43,590 --> 02:27:49,350
the 14,000 people said. I care about what five of you have to say. The five of you that I made up

789
02:27:49,350 --> 02:27:53,829
that agree with everything I ever say. And there's nobody ever disagrees. And it's the five of you.

790
02:27:54,790 --> 02:27:58,790
I have Avengers in this chat right now and you think it's you, you know what I mean?

791
02:27:58,790 --> 02:28:07,030
Just sitting there like, yeah, it's me. I'm the one. It's probably a lot. How many of you just did

792
02:28:07,030 --> 02:28:42,809
that? Oh, let's talk about TF2 cases. I'm curious. So they did a thing where damage, yup. What's the

793
02:28:42,809 --> 02:29:00,600
next among us stream? Uh, it was a one night only. Okay. So cases in TF2. I remember the last time I

794
02:29:00,600 --> 02:29:08,520
really played, it was you opened up weapons cases, but those are no longer a thing. It's now paint

795
02:29:08,520 --> 02:29:17,540
cases that you can put on most anything. And the paint has quality. Is that, that's what's,

796
02:29:17,540 --> 02:29:29,110
that's what's going on, right? Uh, or so this, yeah, there's cosmetic cases and then there's

797
02:29:29,110 --> 02:29:35,559
the paint cases and the paint cases are the old weapons cases, but the paint can now go on most

798
02:29:36,360 --> 02:29:46,920
main, um, like number one in your loadout. So what is considered a really rare case or a really good

799
02:29:46,920 --> 02:29:57,559
case? That sounds kind of good. When you do not use your main attack for two seconds, your abilities

800
02:29:57,559 --> 02:30:11,899
become stronger over time up to winter, winter 2017. I'm not sure which one of these to take.

801
02:30:12,459 --> 02:30:27,989
I feel like this, the range character really needs to shoot the bow. 30 or 40 is pretty special.

802
02:30:33,510 --> 02:30:40,790
Yeah. Holly just reminded me. So let's just take a, let's take a little bit of break and go over

803
02:30:40,790 --> 02:30:45,260
this because you got, some of you guys are going to really, really, you're going to like this one.

804
02:30:45,260 --> 02:30:49,100
Okay. Take the ring. All right. Well, take the ring. But I let, while I have a second to give you a

805
02:30:49,100 --> 02:30:55,059
quick little story, if you had any indication at all of what kind of player is playing the game

806
02:30:55,059 --> 02:31:02,520
of team fortress. So in spawn, when you see that flog pyro in spawn and it's like, what the

807
02:31:02,520 --> 02:31:10,100
fuck is that guy doing? It might be AFK. I, uh, got really high and just ate like almost a whole

808
02:31:10,100 --> 02:31:16,569
bag of chocolates and AFK'd in the spawn as a flog pyro for an entire round. If you're wondering

809
02:31:16,569 --> 02:31:24,100
who is behind the flog pyro, that's, that's what we do. That's what we do. And it, it got me thinking

810
02:31:24,100 --> 02:31:32,520
about, holy shit. I just, I just did that. I lost that match because of you. Yeah. I just,

811
02:31:32,520 --> 02:31:40,709
I had the flog out and I was just sitting there just eating chocolate. And I was sitting there

812
02:31:40,709 --> 02:31:45,030
going, ah, I haven't really done anything this round. I think I walked out of the spawn and died

813
02:31:45,030 --> 02:31:50,569
once. And I think I fell asleep too. I think I fell asleep and woke up at the second round.

814
02:31:53,399 --> 02:32:04,040
So that, if you're curious, that you're, you're right. You're correct. I am that flog pyro. I just

815
02:32:04,040 --> 02:32:14,309
wanted to make sure you were aware. It really happened that I, all right. Which one of these

816
02:32:14,309 --> 02:32:28,340
am I taking? Bro, you're like 45. Not quite. Not quite. Take the ring. TF2's greatest soldiers.

817
02:32:28,340 --> 02:32:35,879
Thank you. Yeah. And then I walk out of spawn and I get the, the, the, the flog up the, with the,

818
02:32:35,879 --> 02:32:43,909
the meter, whatever it's called. And then sniper. It's like, dude, you, you, he's way too far away

819
02:32:43,909 --> 02:32:48,840
and just holding down the crit fire. You're not going to make it. You're not going to make it.

820
02:32:48,920 --> 02:32:56,440
Flog pyros, listen to me. I'm telling you, we have to be better. We have to be better. I know

821
02:32:56,440 --> 02:33:22,979
we can be. Okay. I'll take the, uh, I'll take the ring. I really did just eat chocolate for

822
02:33:22,979 --> 02:33:31,370
the whole round. It was fucked. Don't ever use a Liberty launcher again. Hey, I'm going to use

823
02:33:31,370 --> 02:33:47,370
whatever item I feel like using. This one's really good too though. Well, they were little chocolates.

824
02:33:47,370 --> 02:33:52,489
They were the little tiny ones. So I, realistically, I probably ate like a bar and a half of chocolate.

825
02:33:53,030 --> 02:33:59,139
It was just the little, the little Hershey's mini ones, which you're never ready to eat.

826
02:33:59,139 --> 02:34:04,020
Just one of those. I might as well just buy the Hershey's bars, the full bars,

827
02:34:04,020 --> 02:34:07,620
because I always eat a full bar worth of them. Anyways, what's the point of getting the little

828
02:34:07,620 --> 02:34:23,219
ones? I think 10% tax. What about Hershey kisses? Hershey kisses are good. And I know I look,

829
02:34:24,260 --> 02:34:31,299
dude. Hey, wait a minute. Hershey's tastes like puke. Hershey's tastes like somebody puked in your

830
02:34:31,299 --> 02:34:40,889
face. Yeah. It's, I still don't, I like it. Yeah. And if you smell the inside of a bag of M&M's

831
02:34:40,889 --> 02:34:44,409
after there's no M&M's in it, it smells like somebody's shit in your bathroom an hour ago.

832
02:34:44,409 --> 02:35:07,239
We all know this. Uh, it's this one. It's always the damage. Uh, I need to go deposit this ring

833
02:35:07,239 --> 02:35:37,559
because it's really good. German. Nobody knows this. Try it next time. 10% movement speed. Yeah.

834
02:35:38,200 --> 02:35:50,469
Need to get to that well. Hershey's is a terrible chocolate. Yeah, but it's hard to beat taking a

835
02:35:50,469 --> 02:35:57,829
graham cracker, having a graham. I've taken a nice warm marshmallow, squishing it with the two or

836
02:35:57,829 --> 02:36:04,600
three blocks of Hershey's and making a little more. It's just, it hits so different. I don't

837
02:36:04,600 --> 02:36:09,079
care how gross you think Hershey's is. That hits differently. It just does. It's very, very good.

838
02:36:10,040 --> 02:36:21,219
However many fit. It's sometimes it's too, too little squares. Whatever fits on the graham cracker.

839
02:36:21,860 --> 02:36:26,100
After you eat European chocolate, you'll never want American chocolate ever again.

840
02:36:26,100 --> 02:36:32,579
I trust me. I've had a lot of chocolate. I've had it from all over the world. I've had chocolate.

841
02:36:32,579 --> 02:36:40,790
I've had tons of it, but okay. I've had a lot of like Kraft cheeseburgers and like I've had like

842
02:36:40,790 --> 02:36:43,430
a bunch of stakes before. That doesn't mean I'm never going to eat McDonald's ever again.

843
02:36:44,069 --> 02:36:47,420
Sometimes it's just you, you're looking for a different,

844
02:36:48,379 --> 02:36:53,940
you're looking for a different feel today. A McDonald's cheeseburger is arguably not even

845
02:36:53,940 --> 02:37:00,340
remotely close, not even close to a burger you'd get at a nice restaurant, but I'm still going to

846
02:37:00,340 --> 02:37:13,420
get it sometimes. Should I just go full movement speed piercing? Yeah. All right. Where's the well?

847
02:37:15,129 --> 02:37:28,329
All right. I'm at the 10 minute mark. Where's the boss? I need more attack speed.

848
02:37:28,889 --> 02:37:48,899
Grandpa's on the food podcast rant again. I'm telling you, do not be surprised. Don't be

849
02:37:48,899 --> 02:37:56,739
surprised. I'm just saying don't be surprised if when I am retired, there is a food podcast.

850
02:37:56,739 --> 02:38:01,860
That's like once every few weeks. Don't be surprised. I'm just, I'm telling you what is

851
02:38:01,860 --> 02:38:24,709
probably happening. Do not be surprised. This one hopes are skyrocketing for the food podcast.

852
02:38:32,329 --> 02:38:39,030
You better call it food mode enabled. How one gamer saw his love for food turn into a second

853
02:38:39,030 --> 02:38:51,659
hobby. By the way, we don't talk about food at all on this podcast at all. It's an, and when it's

854
02:38:51,659 --> 02:39:03,590
getting, when it gets brought up, I get annoyed at the guest. Oh my God. That's a lot. This actually

855
02:39:03,590 --> 02:39:27,940
could be the one. So I'm going to pay attention now. So let's put the gamer trying hands on damage.

856
02:39:42,100 --> 02:39:45,540
Let me pause it for one second. Somebody has an explanation. There's a reason American chocolate

857
02:39:45,540 --> 02:39:49,459
has that flavor because back in the early days of Hershey's when transporting the milk got timed

858
02:39:49,459 --> 02:40:22,520
out. Nevermind. Uh, I'm not doing so well. I need more health. Yeah, I have to take it and then

859
02:40:22,520 --> 02:40:42,120
hopefully you drop an item. Come on, come on, come on. You did lightning strike. I like splinters.

860
02:40:43,059 --> 02:41:03,739
They seems like pretty good. I like the area denial movement speed again. You might think

861
02:41:03,739 --> 02:41:23,190
that that's not a smart play, but in about one to two minutes it will be. All right. Uh,

862
02:41:24,309 --> 02:41:33,219
this is the one I want to deposit. That kind of nerves me a lot right now though. So I probably

863
02:41:33,219 --> 02:41:45,659
won't beat it. Who's he talking to? My grandma though. She's right here. Hey, thanks. Thanks

864
02:41:45,659 --> 02:42:08,819
grandma. The fuck do you think I was talking to? Damn. That's a lot. Let's try to collect as many

865
02:42:08,819 --> 02:42:26,870
things as possible. Speed or damage? Yeah. Damn it. I need more attack speed. If I see it,

866
02:42:26,870 --> 02:42:38,649
I have to grab it. It doesn't matter what the other options are. What is that? Anybody know what that

867
02:42:38,649 --> 02:43:17,690
is? 100% damage. Nice. Okay. I want the health and the movement speed. Whoa, there's a lot of shit

868
02:43:17,690 --> 02:43:49,239
over here. Big damage. 8% duration projectiles. Yep. I think I got most of it. Nice. More projectiles.

869
02:43:49,239 --> 02:44:02,700
I got three arrows now. That's awesome. Okay. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Damage.

870
02:44:05,180 --> 02:44:48,059
Where's the boss? Here. Kill. Kill. Kill. Okay. I don't have any of these. When you do not use

871
02:44:48,059 --> 02:44:55,700
your main attack for two seconds, your abilities become stronger. All right. Plus 0.07% damage for

872
02:44:55,700 --> 02:45:18,649
each missing health point. So 0.07 times 589. What is that? 10% crit? That's not very much.

873
02:45:18,649 --> 02:45:31,659
Like 14% right now. I mean, I guess it's okay. I'll do it. I'll try it. I'm doing more damage

874
02:45:31,659 --> 02:45:39,350
right now. So I shouldn't want to get any more health. Oh, that's doing actually a lot. That's

875
02:45:39,350 --> 02:45:47,459
a lot more than I thought it was going to be. Attack speed. Where's the boss? All right. Killed

876
02:45:47,459 --> 02:45:55,319
it. Oops. All right. This actually might be the one as long as I can actually do it.

877
02:45:56,340 --> 02:46:19,350
Not talk about it because I am actually mowing down monsters right now. Attack speed is really

878
02:46:19,350 --> 02:47:03,530
killing me though. I need it. Damn it. That's probably just the orb. Cheese. Two hits to the

879
02:47:03,530 --> 02:47:20,649
shields. All right. Now I'm going up to pick up this thing and I'm going to collect everything.

880
02:47:20,649 --> 02:47:29,559
I just, you know what I'm saying? Carrot only three health. What's the point of even picking

881
02:47:29,559 --> 02:48:07,829
it up? That was three health. There it is. Finally get to five health for max damage. Yeah. But

882
02:48:07,829 --> 02:48:17,340
five health means I'm dead. Didn't one hit. If I'm careful, I could probably do it. There's one more

883
02:48:17,340 --> 02:48:24,569
boss. All right. This is where it gets really, really bad, but I should be fine. Carve a path

884
02:48:24,569 --> 02:48:46,139
out. That's all it is. Forget about any of the items. I'll get them all with the magnet. Okay.

885
02:48:46,139 --> 02:48:49,579
Shit. All right. All right. All right. All right. Okay. Okay. All right. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm

886
02:48:49,579 --> 02:49:22,920
fine. Piercing. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Come on. Just give me it. It's right here.

887
02:49:22,920 --> 02:49:28,870
I'm getting so much health. I need this. I'll level up like three times if I pick this up.

888
02:49:28,870 --> 02:49:50,329
Let's go. Okay. More attack speed. Now we walk all the way back down here.

889
02:49:50,329 --> 02:50:37,700
Damage. Damage. Duration. I don't know. It could be bebecrit damage. All right. This is it. Attack

890
02:50:37,700 --> 02:50:50,899
speed is priority if I find it and just try to stay alive. Nice. Electrified orbs. Orbs deal

891
02:50:50,899 --> 02:51:00,659
additional lightning damage based on their movement speed. What's my movement speed right now? I mean,

892
02:51:00,659 --> 02:51:13,690
that sounds kind of amazing. My movement speed is pretty high. All right. There's another magnet

893
02:51:13,690 --> 02:52:10,409
down here. Get down there. Jesus. Okay. 50% crit damage. I can't go anywhere. Don't freak out.

894
02:52:11,049 --> 02:52:16,500
Don't freak out. Just get out of here. Just get out. Get out of this stupid thing I'm in.

895
02:52:17,059 --> 02:53:16,020
Then I'm going to I'm going to heal. Nice. Nice. Attack speed. I need it. I'm going to stay over

896
02:53:16,020 --> 02:53:40,760
here because yeah, this is where it gets. There's the boss. Play it smart. Oh, there's too many.

897
02:54:15,350 --> 02:54:27,819
Shit. Oh, I was so close. Damn it. Spawning behind me. That sucked. I got a lot of stuff,

898
02:54:27,819 --> 02:54:51,219
though. Ability expert. Elven slippers. Arcane splitter. My next main quest. Cool. All right.

899
02:54:51,219 --> 02:55:20,469
How much does it cost for this? Okay. No, never mind. That's that's ludicrous. Equip the ring.

900
02:55:20,469 --> 02:55:32,219
Ah, pick up range or attack speed. I think I need more defense. Should I keep watching or should I

901
02:55:32,219 --> 02:55:39,639
go shit? I'll be back. I'll be here when you get back. Or maybe you do something else today.

902
02:55:39,639 --> 02:55:51,270
Attack speed. Kind of feels mandatory, doesn't it? And the health. Do I need a shield for block

903
02:55:51,270 --> 02:56:31,530
strength? How does that work? Can do defense or pick up range. No, I want movement speed is so

904
02:56:31,530 --> 02:56:47,750
important. Let me refund to all. I got 11,000. What do I damage? 30% more damage. 18% more attack

905
02:56:47,750 --> 02:57:09,780
speed and movement speed and pick up range. And I got my items on. So what's the next quest?

906
02:57:09,780 --> 02:57:15,690
I haven't been here in a while. What's this place? Okay. Kill 15,000 enemies in one visit.

907
02:57:15,690 --> 02:57:26,809
Kill 50,000 imps. Defeat the flame dancer. Survive the ember grounds until there are 12 minutes left.

908
02:57:26,809 --> 02:57:35,739
I can do that. Kill a thousand enemies in one visit. I can do that right now. Let's do it right

909
02:57:35,739 --> 02:57:45,860
now. It's 12 minutes. That's it. Wait, that's actually kind of a long time. I'll try. We have

910
02:57:45,860 --> 02:57:52,579
a stretch break. Um, yeah, it's been like three hours. I'm going to go get some water. I'll be

911
02:57:52,579 --> 02:58:07,739
right back. Hey guys, I just stood up to go get some water and there are orcs outside of my room.

912
02:58:07,739 --> 03:02:27,909
That's the orcs are coming music. Be right back. How is the uh, how's the fight against all the

913
03:02:27,909 --> 03:02:49,139
orcs going in my absence? We are losing. Uh oh. Let me get in here. Hey, let me get in here and

914
03:02:49,139 --> 03:02:57,020
get this all sorted out for you. All right. What I just have to live until there's 12 minutes left.

915
03:02:57,020 --> 03:03:02,569
All right. I got it more. Look at I'm already doing a ton of damage. There's that progression

916
03:03:02,569 --> 03:03:36,389
system. Speed. Speed again if it's there. Crits. I'm building attack speed first as fast as I can

917
03:03:36,389 --> 03:03:41,020
so I don't have to worry about it later because I kind of got all caught up before

918
03:03:41,020 --> 03:04:10,059
because I didn't have, I wasn't doing enough dps. All right. Range. Pick up range. We're going with

919
03:04:10,059 --> 03:04:27,959
a utility build. We're going to go with some utility. Wow. That's great to get right now.

920
03:04:47,500 --> 03:04:54,170
Sometimes I do block. I'm curious how that system works. Is it just straight up a percent to block?

921
03:04:54,170 --> 03:05:28,549
Chance. Get more defense. Read the thing. Kind of good but damage. Don't listen to that person.

922
03:05:28,549 --> 03:05:31,670
Ban them. I don't even know who you're referring to. There's a lot of people here.

923
03:05:31,750 --> 03:05:43,940
Hey ban that. Ban that guy in chat. Don't listen to them. I've actually been at like a stadium

924
03:05:43,940 --> 03:05:52,569
and I just hear from like row eight. Seat number like fucking 400. You're going to ban that guy.

925
03:05:53,129 --> 03:05:58,920
Ban that guy. Ban him. He's a piece of shit. And I'm just looking. I don't know who. Who?

926
03:05:58,920 --> 03:06:02,520
He's like that guy. That guy right there. That guy. He's pointing. It's like dude there's like

927
03:06:02,520 --> 03:06:09,690
600 people where you're pointing. I don't know that this one. This guy here. No you fucking idiot.

928
03:06:09,690 --> 03:06:33,909
No you're so stupid. You're way off. This guy. This guy right here. No. Ban that. Ban that guy.

929
03:06:40,790 --> 03:06:50,899
Always attack speed. Am I at the cap? Why do I feel like I'm at the attack speed cap? It feels

930
03:06:50,899 --> 03:07:28,979
like it. Is there a cap? I don't think there would be. Damage again. I gotta get this to 200

931
03:07:28,979 --> 03:07:47,770
really quickly. More crit chance. Crit damage is great but you actually have to be critting.

932
03:07:47,770 --> 03:07:57,340
So let's get that situated first. Now we can get it. I mean we. Why do you keep saying we? I don't

933
03:07:57,340 --> 03:08:31,559
know. How close am I to? No not even close. Never mind. Wells right here. If he dropped something

934
03:08:31,559 --> 03:08:48,100
good. Get these little shell fucking things out of here. God that just took half my health.

935
03:08:48,100 --> 03:09:26,100
Okay it's not an item but it's archment. I'm already almost dead. Oh thank god it's saving us. Okay

936
03:09:26,100 --> 03:09:39,180
now slow it down and get some health. I can't even get in there. That little shit has like a thousand

937
03:09:39,180 --> 03:09:58,170
health. All right. Uh splinters. Attack speed. Am I at a cap? I feel like I'm not swinging faster

938
03:09:58,170 --> 03:10:25,909
for the last like three times I've done this. You are? No cap. No cap. No cap. Are you sure? 1.8.

939
03:10:25,909 --> 03:10:45,420
No cap. No cap. Um I guess there is no cap. I feel like I haven't seen a 20% increase. I'm

940
03:10:45,420 --> 03:11:15,430
gonna piss people off for that. There it is. 25% critical damage main weapon and then a 10% cone

941
03:11:15,430 --> 03:11:57,399
with with the main weapon. Okay collect the part that sucks. I haven't seen this guy before. Oh

942
03:11:57,399 --> 03:12:12,170
no wait we have. Very briefly. Oh yeah I remember this. It is this guy. And goodbye. I got further

943
03:12:12,170 --> 03:12:25,719
than I did before. That was hard. I did that at least. Character exterminator. I unlocked a new

944
03:12:25,719 --> 03:12:54,120
character. It's the exterminator. Cool. It's a ranged character. Movement speed. Attack speed.

945
03:12:54,120 --> 03:13:04,790
Yeah I'll keep other. I'll keep the rest of this one. This is the worst character. Um let's find out.

946
03:13:04,790 --> 03:13:22,729
I got one of these done. Beat the lich. One run. Geez. All right I'm gonna try to get to the end.

947
03:13:22,729 --> 03:13:49,979
Haunted caverns. It's a flamethrower guy. What do we do? Attack speed. I'm imagining it's probably

948
03:13:49,979 --> 03:14:15,750
just spray. All attack speed. Don't touch that. Not yet. Seems kind of fun. Blog gaming. Oh yeah.

949
03:14:20,139 --> 03:14:48,229
Where are my chocolates? The auto attack is funny because it just holds the button down.

950
03:14:48,229 --> 03:15:04,139
Useful whatever. Getting some kind of shit rolls here. Should I turn on auto aim too? Yeah. All

951
03:15:04,139 --> 03:15:23,430
right I'm playing just with I'm playing with my left hand. 10% burn chance. I guess that's good.

952
03:15:23,430 --> 03:15:38,059
Attack speed and burn chance. This doesn't do very much damage but I guess it stacks. This sounds

953
03:15:38,059 --> 03:15:43,579
like shaking a bunch of colored pencils. It that might even be more accurate than the lego comment.

954
03:15:44,709 --> 03:15:51,739
Yeah it's grabbing a bunch and I mean at least 30 colored pencils and when you do that you get a you

955
03:15:51,739 --> 03:15:58,579
pick up as many as you can and then like six or seven drop on the ground. Yep oh I know. Speed.

956
03:16:02,379 --> 03:16:26,940
Follow the blood. I was gonna say who is that my blood? Whose blood is this? Uh what is that?

957
03:16:27,579 --> 03:16:44,969
Uh oh. 100? 100 what? What does that mean? 199. Why is it counting down? Don't leave the area.

958
03:16:44,969 --> 03:16:56,040
Kill 99 things inside of it. This character. Probably lightning strike because I don't have

959
03:16:56,040 --> 03:17:04,149
to do anything. It just does it automatically. I'm gonna do lightning strike. So kill things inside

960
03:17:04,149 --> 03:17:42,280
of here okay. That hurt a lot. Definitely more range. All right three two one zero. What is that?

961
03:17:42,920 --> 03:17:57,739
Was that a super item? Like a piece of something? Okay I actually want to aim now because it's

962
03:17:57,739 --> 03:18:23,420
aiming erratically in random directions. Oh shit. You know I have area. Rejectile area

963
03:18:24,139 --> 03:18:44,420
is I think what you need to put on with this guy. All right follow the blood back but don't die.

964
03:19:03,049 --> 03:19:29,420
10% is not very much when it's 28. Like one or two damage. Oh wait where's the blood? I forgot

965
03:19:29,420 --> 03:20:00,409
about the blood trail. Where'd it go? Where's that blood trail? There it is. Okay now give me

966
03:20:00,409 --> 03:20:14,180
something else. I kind of like this character. Am I going to keep saying that in another five

967
03:20:14,180 --> 03:20:39,190
minutes when I can't hurt anything? Probably not. I know. Yes safe safe. I'm trying to be safe.

968
03:20:39,190 --> 03:20:50,889
Safe Andy. That's me. I want help. I could. That scared me a lot. I just did not expect

969
03:20:50,889 --> 03:20:58,329
it to be there right there. Sorry I know I'm like kind of chilled out tonight and that was a very

970
03:20:58,329 --> 03:21:21,639
loud sound. I do apologize. It's actually kind of good against bosses though. What do we got?

971
03:21:21,639 --> 03:21:30,979
Base crit, defense and block, spike boots. When hit drop 10 spikes to the ground that deal 100

972
03:21:30,979 --> 03:21:43,079
damage and stun the enemy on contact. Takes four seconds to recharge. I mean just the crit. Yeah

973
03:21:43,079 --> 03:21:52,840
those are cool. What does it say? And so it came to pass that the countess who once bathed into

974
03:21:52,840 --> 03:22:31,350
rejuvenating blood. I think I have that. I have that area. I want to deposit the

975
03:22:47,479 --> 03:23:10,780
item that I got because I'm afraid of my death. Will this work with fire? It does. Oh

976
03:23:10,780 --> 03:23:25,110
then I want it. I'm gonna pick this up first because I think I can collect a lot of things.

977
03:23:25,110 --> 03:23:41,659
What was that? 10,000. I know I didn't forget about the blood. I just want to get this because

978
03:23:41,659 --> 03:23:58,040
I can level up probably two three times. 10% burn chance. Yep that's a 20. Is that it?

979
03:23:58,040 --> 03:24:30,540
There's gotta be more than that. Well stream from a library computer. No range. Yeah.

980
03:25:01,270 --> 03:25:07,540
Okay all the bone rattling. Yeah it just kind of sounds like this colored pencils all over

981
03:25:07,540 --> 03:25:28,870
the ground. They're just a bunch of rats running in circles. Does this mean that they'll come out

982
03:25:28,870 --> 03:25:56,020
faster? I think so. All right where's this other piece? Any more range? I picked it up a couple

983
03:25:56,020 --> 03:26:03,899
times. About the last few times though. All right here it comes. I gotta kill 90 people in here.

984
03:26:04,540 --> 03:26:50,629
That's not too bad actually. As long as there's no time limit that's fine. Area yep. Oh there's so

985
03:26:50,629 --> 03:27:02,729
many in there. All right only one more. I got it. I got the whole thing. So now I go back to that

986
03:27:02,729 --> 03:27:36,469
podium. All right I'm gonna kill this elite. It's gonna give me a bunch of stuff. Fuck I'm gonna die.

987
03:27:37,110 --> 03:27:56,260
How many elites are there? I'll just run. There's so much bullshit everywhere.

988
03:27:59,340 --> 03:28:06,819
I need health. I just did I actually just lose it right when I picked it up? Come on.

989
03:28:06,819 --> 03:28:47,850
That's a big stinker right there. All right orbs. Some health regen and defense. More damage.

990
03:28:48,569 --> 03:29:23,770
So far so good. Ah shit. This one. You're gonna play portal 2 ever? I played through portal 2.

991
03:29:23,770 --> 03:29:29,059
I think like two or three times so I don't think I would ever stream portal 2. I mean

992
03:29:29,059 --> 03:29:32,899
maybe to go back and be like hey remember how good this game was? I guess I'm just gonna play it.

993
03:29:33,700 --> 03:29:50,819
Oh my god. Okay that was just a I was like a blessed more range. Oh yeah okay more attack speed.

994
03:29:53,459 --> 03:30:15,399
All right don't blow this now. I need to get healed. Blood trail up. I'm afraid if I deposit

995
03:30:15,399 --> 03:30:20,139
this thing I'm gonna get killed by whatever comes out of it. Oh whatever. I guess we'll see it.

996
03:30:20,780 --> 03:30:35,159
People are calling you the pirate of twitch because you don't brush your teeth. Is that true?

997
03:30:39,819 --> 03:30:45,719
Yeah that's why they call me that. Ah my teeth are fucking black and gray.

998
03:30:47,430 --> 03:30:54,870
They don't brush me teeth. I never have it. I never will. That's my whole stick. I look

999
03:30:54,870 --> 03:31:01,079
out and doesn't brush his fucking teeth ever. And I look into the camera and I go like ah.

1000
03:31:01,959 --> 03:31:09,719
I do that every every like five minutes. No I don't want to die please. I want to at least

1001
03:31:09,719 --> 03:31:26,659
deposit this thing. No. Where is it? Where is it? Somebody said a stupid pirate joke and now I've

1002
03:31:26,659 --> 03:31:48,500
I forgot where I am. Where is it? It's right there. I'm just gonna kill this fucking guy right now.

1003
03:31:48,500 --> 03:32:32,709
He's gonna keep just messing with me. Hurry up and die. Did that just save my life? It may have.

1004
03:32:32,709 --> 03:32:39,639
Oh my god damn it dude. I don't. All right all right all right all right. I gotta I just got

1005
03:32:40,040 --> 03:32:43,819
the first time I ever played with that character. That's the first time I've ever played with that

1006
03:32:43,819 --> 03:32:53,659
character okay. Fire damage is now a blessing. I got a new ability. A dragon's breath or something.

1007
03:32:53,659 --> 03:33:23,420
Like I had you have to play to unlock stuff. Fire damage. I'm just gonna go all in. Fire damage and

1008
03:33:24,139 --> 03:33:40,469
damage. Bow and attack speed and projectile size. Can you please say please? Go wide not ah that's

1009
03:33:40,469 --> 03:33:57,420
actually true. So this is wide and a shitload of fire damage. I'll try it. I could afford this.

1010
03:33:57,420 --> 03:34:09,700
Let's do it again. This is fun. I like this game. All right so what do we what do we got?

1011
03:34:09,700 --> 03:34:25,860
I have to kill the lich. Kill a bunch of slimes. How do you do 750,000 in one run?

1012
03:34:26,420 --> 03:34:38,440
This is not in one run so I'm gonna try to take lightning strike again. Stop dying.

1013
03:34:38,440 --> 03:34:54,620
Play for 333 minutes. How long has that been? Kill 100,000 enemies. Crit enemies 50,000 times.

1014
03:34:55,100 --> 03:35:06,920
Deal 10 million damage in total. It's almost there. Collect 20,000. Apply damage effects.

1015
03:35:06,920 --> 03:35:21,129
Kill a total of 10 bosses. Almost there. Apply debuffs 50,000 times. Story. Wait there's a story.

1016
03:35:21,129 --> 03:35:37,879
Reach level 60. Ah it's individual character stuff. Destroy objects. All right reach level 30 with

1017
03:35:37,879 --> 03:35:49,430
the exterminator and then burn. Can chat have a lala? Um in like another six or seven hours.

1018
03:35:49,510 --> 03:35:56,950
I like that each class has their own individual trees kind of go through.

1019
03:35:56,950 --> 03:36:22,489
Hold on let me put this up here. Did it work? Did not. No teeth. Hold on. You guys are linking

1020
03:36:22,489 --> 03:36:37,340
like pirate faces. This is just this is the okay this is the weird magician one right where I was

1021
03:36:37,340 --> 03:36:46,899
like I drank the chaos potion. This is the chaos potion one but this one's a little bit different.

1022
03:36:46,899 --> 03:36:56,659
Okay this is I drank the chaos potion but have since kind of learned to to to be okay with the

1023
03:36:56,659 --> 03:37:32,629
chaos potion enabled. Yeah this is 10 years later after I drank the chaos potion. That's

1024
03:37:35,209 --> 03:37:41,290
that's a good one. That's a really good one. Somebody said dude that looks like a heroes of

1025
03:37:41,290 --> 03:37:57,770
might and magic portrait. It yeah that's perfect. That's an actual good one. Yeah we'll we'll let

1026
03:37:57,770 --> 03:38:15,700
them hang out down here for a little while. Okay face cam. Oh yeah face cam. Look face cam tonight.

1027
03:38:15,700 --> 03:38:22,090
All right so I did burn damage. I need to do I just have to kill I just I just have to survive

1028
03:38:22,090 --> 03:38:37,340
to level 30. I should be able to do that simp very simply. Burn damage is way higher. My

1029
03:38:38,219 --> 03:38:47,989
the other stuff that I did should be good. All right I'm going attack speed. Speed and burn.

1030
03:38:47,989 --> 03:38:53,500
Speed and burn. Speed and burn. I need to I don't care about any of the items. I'm not doing

1031
03:38:53,500 --> 03:39:00,489
anything weird. I just want to get to level 30 on this character. Regen. I want I want to get to

1032
03:39:00,489 --> 03:39:59,020
like two to three health a second. Germa nine matey five. Nice uh hold on this is the character

1033
03:39:59,020 --> 03:40:22,870
I'm playing as. That's like my portrait. I feel like that is gonna just start moving around

1034
03:40:24,379 --> 03:40:32,379
like a full motion video game. When I die that guy over there on the screen is gonna just start

1035
03:40:32,379 --> 03:40:38,739
saying things and then he's it's gonna cut and it's gonna be back to the regular place like

1036
03:40:38,739 --> 03:40:44,280
right there. So he's gonna be like oh almost had me that time and then he's gonna just cut back

1037
03:40:44,280 --> 03:40:57,930
to being a static health regen. I'm going for it now. I know I should have gotten the other thing

1038
03:40:57,930 --> 03:41:11,510
but let me try to get to like one health a second. It'd be so fun to make an FMV game.

1039
03:41:13,219 --> 03:41:18,620
You know I've thought about that over the years. It's just I it'd be so fun to make one of those

1040
03:41:18,620 --> 03:41:26,120
like an old like an old shooter. Get the stunt people make a whole thing over. I think it'd be

1041
03:41:26,120 --> 03:41:42,620
so fun to just like do that. Speed. You officially lost your marbles. I don't think so. I think I'm

1042
03:41:42,620 --> 03:41:53,219
okay. I think I'm doing fine. Are you still making that video? That video was put on hiatus and I

1043
03:41:53,219 --> 03:42:03,879
just never opened it up. So yes I still I do still think about it very frequently. It is in my brain

1044
03:42:03,959 --> 03:42:18,840
very frequently. One day you will see. One day you'll see. It's not really a big deal. I I've

1045
03:42:18,840 --> 03:42:26,180
been talking about this video but I'm trying to set expectations to zero. It's literally one thing

1046
03:42:26,180 --> 03:42:41,540
I think is funny for about eight to ten minutes straight. Oh this is new. Dragon's breath. Damage.

1047
03:42:41,540 --> 03:42:49,590
Yeah what does it do? Ah it just shoots it out like a big wave. Sorry so it's just double fire.

1048
03:42:50,389 --> 03:43:11,639
Oh point 15 additional flame walls and 10% area. Yeah just keep this still as your face cam for the

1049
03:43:11,639 --> 03:43:24,709
rest of the streams. If I actually looked like that I would probably have face cam on every day

1050
03:43:26,010 --> 03:43:32,489
and I would just I would move my face around and be like yeah I would be it would be so fun. It'd

1051
03:43:32,489 --> 03:43:37,479
be so fun to have just like a full head of hair and a gigantic beard like that. I would make all

1052
03:43:37,479 --> 03:43:56,520
kinds of face movements. I would be unbearable. I would be unbearable. Do a vtuber thing.

1053
03:43:59,940 --> 03:44:06,100
What happened? Yeah there's all there's lots of things that I've said I wanted to do but just

1054
03:44:06,100 --> 03:44:15,219
never did it. We talked about the idea. I don't know. Yeah we did. I wanted to make a disgusting

1055
03:44:15,219 --> 03:44:20,889
slime avatar and just have a big cigar hanging out of the mouth and just be awful on stream

1056
03:44:20,889 --> 03:44:28,120
and start at zero and don't tell anybody and just be fucking awful and toxic and mean and shit to

1057
03:44:28,120 --> 03:44:39,979
everybody. Just like talk shit to people in chat like if somebody even asks like a very basic

1058
03:44:39,979 --> 03:44:43,899
question just tell them to like to fuck off and just like make fun of them and stuff.

1059
03:44:45,739 --> 03:45:08,729
This character would be unbearable. All right if that account gets banned do I get banned

1060
03:45:08,729 --> 03:45:36,260
or can I go no it wasn't me it was it was the goblin it was the goblin. That's burn damage is

1061
03:45:36,260 --> 03:46:20,739
doing a lot more. 50. I feel a lot stronger in this one. Definitely going to improve even more.

1062
03:46:20,739 --> 03:46:25,989
Ah which one? Burn chance or additional attacks? I feel like burn chance is probably what to do.

1063
03:46:25,989 --> 03:46:54,440
Is multi hit just best in slot for every character? It probably is. WM1. Sometimes it works. I'm going

1064
03:46:54,440 --> 03:47:10,780
to make my way down to that. Level up one more time. I always damage. All right let's get rid

1065
03:47:10,780 --> 03:47:27,530
of this guy quick. Let's try not to get hit once. All right that was that was clean. That was really

1066
03:47:27,530 --> 03:47:46,260
clean. It was very clean. Feels very good. I think it's this it's this one plus 10 to base attack

1067
03:47:46,260 --> 03:47:59,979
damage that just it's definitely the ring. Look at that. That's amazing. All right now don't mess it

1068
03:47:59,979 --> 03:48:12,379
up because this could be the one at least to get to level 30. What am I missing right now? What

1069
03:48:12,379 --> 03:48:23,420
what could I what could I use? What could I really need? What do I need? Besides the scroll more burn

1070
03:48:23,500 --> 03:48:46,600
more attack speed more movement speed more regen. I am very slow that's true. You need a lot of

1071
03:48:46,600 --> 03:49:18,700
really more movement speed than this. Okay I definitely feel very slow so good idea. This

1072
03:49:18,700 --> 03:49:41,659
fucking pirate picture is so weird. Yes 10 million damage total. What do I get for that? I kind of

1073
03:49:41,659 --> 03:49:47,180
look like somebody cosplaying as a pirate that takes it dead seriously and at a convention you

1074
03:49:47,180 --> 03:49:50,620
see the guy that looks like this and you're like holy shit that guy take this guy that guy means

1075
03:49:50,620 --> 03:50:36,149
business. That guy means business. That's huge. You guys are you guys are fucking crazy. All right

1076
03:50:36,149 --> 03:50:55,739
I gotta get this scroll. Are there two of them now? Wait why are there two of these? No though okay

1077
03:50:55,739 --> 03:51:03,559
the one the that one is I leveled up five times and I think I'm the fucking man even though I'm

1078
03:51:03,559 --> 03:51:16,629
essentially the same character. I'm just like level six instead of level one. All right I gotta

1079
03:51:16,870 --> 03:51:36,780
get back to pay attention. This shoe is through people especially the ability power I think is

1080
03:51:36,780 --> 03:51:45,370
great. Um health regen yeah I need it I want it. I can't just do offense only it's the only reason

1081
03:51:45,370 --> 03:52:02,819
why I keep losing. Wow that's so good that was very good holy shit. I just I actually want to

1082
03:52:02,819 --> 03:52:31,559
say this but it is the title but I just mowed down an entire wave. What is this? I hate this.

1083
03:52:32,280 --> 03:52:42,139
I hate this. Okay I'm gonna use it. What is going on in the world man? What is going on in the world?

1084
03:52:42,139 --> 03:53:08,969
Hold on. What is happening in the world? We've gone too far. How come it's not moving? It's not moving.

1085
03:53:08,969 --> 03:53:22,469
This one's supposed to be moving. This is a gif. I can't get it. Can you make it a video source?

1086
03:53:22,469 --> 03:53:31,450
I don't think so. Hold on. How come this is not playing as a gif? He got he got closer.

1087
03:53:34,229 --> 03:54:05,819
Yeah I just I just leaned in like five feet. Save it as a gif. Okay it's very weird. Okay I I have

1088
03:54:05,819 --> 03:54:10,379
like so many of these saved to my desktop now. No that was a wrong one. I didn't want to put

1089
03:54:10,379 --> 03:54:43,000
that one on. I have so many versions of this now. Okay there it is. Did it work? Why not? Why not?

1090
03:54:43,000 --> 03:55:15,899
This is just this is a different guy. This is not even me. All right I'll leave it for five minutes.

1091
03:55:15,899 --> 03:55:45,500
Uh movement speed. I need it. More regen if I can get it. Yep I want it. Okay I'm almost at one

1092
03:55:45,500 --> 03:56:20,010
per second which is a big deal. I think this is the one. This is a great great great great great

1093
03:56:20,010 --> 03:56:36,780
great great start. What should I actually get with this character? Because I really don't know. Orbs?

1094
03:56:36,780 --> 03:56:40,860
I don't know. Orbs kind of feel not I don't know feel like orbs aren't really doing very much.

1095
03:56:40,860 --> 03:57:16,090
This is creeping us out. Needles? Give me another dragon breath. Raid coming in. Vine sauce raid.

1096
03:57:16,090 --> 03:57:27,510
Vinny. What's up Vinny? Welcome raiders. Welcome ein sauce viewers. Oh and my face cam was just

1097
03:57:27,510 --> 03:57:38,540
off. Let me turn it back on. Throwing the beard out a little. Thanks for the raid Vinny. Hope you had

1098
03:57:38,540 --> 03:57:44,299
a good stream. I hope you guys had a good time watching. We're playing halls of torment. Games

1099
03:57:44,299 --> 03:58:05,239
fucking lit. See I can talk. I'm I'm with it. I'm hip. You have to see Austin powers.

1100
03:58:05,239 --> 03:58:27,059
I'm cool. I'm with it. I'm hip. Oh that one. Austin powers is so good. It really is. Yeah.

1101
03:58:28,020 --> 03:58:40,760
All right so I'm gonna turn this off to not scare all of the vine sauce viewers. This thing is

1102
03:58:40,760 --> 03:58:47,770
gonna be disgusting now. Look at that. Look at that wave. Look at that wave of death. Sorry

1103
03:58:47,770 --> 03:58:59,110
I got a little uh a little overzealous there. Which one would you pick? I'm not sure which one.

1104
03:59:03,690 --> 03:59:24,389
I'm leaning towards attack speed or defense. Any of them? Yeah this is like vampire survivors

1105
03:59:25,030 --> 03:59:33,239
but it's a little different and I'll tell you this is very good. I've played a lot of the vampire

1106
03:59:33,239 --> 03:59:43,659
survivor likes. I think this one is probably it's it's definitely not probably the most fun I've had

1107
03:59:43,659 --> 03:59:49,180
in a vampire survivor's like that was not vampire survivors. I think that with time with a ton of

1108
03:59:49,180 --> 03:59:54,379
additions because the game's not even in beta yet uh I think it seems pretty good. This seems

1109
03:59:54,379 --> 04:00:01,829
pretty fun. It's a good baseline. Depends on how much they add. Have you tried bro tato? I have. I

1110
04:00:01,829 --> 04:00:08,440
have played bro tato but this to me feels the most like vampire survivors. The same kind of

1111
04:00:08,440 --> 04:00:22,520
aesthetic. Remember what we said. I'm all about aesthetic. It sucks that I have to choose this

1112
04:00:22,520 --> 04:00:50,969
but I'm going to. Ah yep. I think I'm all right now. I don't think I need movement speed anymore.

1113
04:00:59,700 --> 04:01:14,709
All right go get the parchment. Have you tried to hollow cure? I have not. I have not. I don't know.

1114
04:01:14,709 --> 04:01:19,139
I don't know. Is it good? Is it like a vampire survivor's game?

1115
04:01:37,190 --> 04:01:43,139
I got it level 30. Nice damage with the yeah 20% more damage. I don't get caught up here.

1116
04:01:43,940 --> 04:01:58,920
This is a good one. I got a good run going. I'm melting these things. Remember how horrible these

1117
04:01:58,920 --> 04:02:14,059
were an hour ago? Not even like 40 minutes ago. I just did a million fire damage. Dragon's Breath

1118
04:02:14,059 --> 04:02:45,100
knocks back enemies. Yep. Damage. Nice. Oh I'm gonna unlock the whole tree for the exterminator.

1119
04:02:46,139 --> 04:03:10,819
Crit chance. Health. Um have I haven't deposited an item. Have I take the boots? I think I want

1120
04:03:10,819 --> 04:03:17,850
to take this and deposit this one. This thing is just uh yeah I'll switch the room. I want to

1121
04:03:17,850 --> 04:03:36,520
deposit this. Yeah I'll take the hood and deposit the drink. All right this is where I have to

1122
04:03:36,520 --> 04:03:40,840
snowball big time because even though I'm doing a lot of damage and I'm fine that changes very

1123
04:03:40,840 --> 04:03:52,420
quickly in four and a half minutes. I'm going to go I'm not going to do the well yet but I'm going

1124
04:03:52,420 --> 04:04:06,469
to do the um might as well. I'm going to go grab that magnet because I wonder how far away it is.

1125
04:04:07,850 --> 04:04:32,780
Crit chance now. If it shows up yeah. Pick up range is a big deal too. Yeah I have completely

1126
04:04:32,780 --> 04:04:37,850
completely neglected pick up range. I do kill things very quickly though.

1127
04:04:58,500 --> 04:05:09,219
Oh this is like god mode. No it's not just invincibility but just take the opportunity

1128
04:05:09,219 --> 04:05:30,340
to run fast. Geez that hurt. Pick up range or let's just do it. I'm safe right now. Plus I'm

1129
04:05:30,340 --> 04:05:52,540
going to level up a ton of times in about 10 seconds. Rotato doesn't have a good art style.

1130
04:05:52,540 --> 04:05:59,799
Rotato was very fun. Rotato does this thing where they say hey do you like this game. Oh you do like

1131
04:05:59,799 --> 04:06:03,719
this game. Well okay well now you're going to play it for a thousand hours because there's like 200

1132
04:06:03,719 --> 04:06:16,139
characters and there's seven difficulties. Like oh okay and each character needs to beat each

1133
04:06:16,139 --> 04:06:25,350
difficulty. Have fun. Okay well now that's that's awesome. Yeah I played a lot of Rotato on the

1134
04:06:25,350 --> 04:06:51,370
iPad. I know. I didn't want to tell you. Crit uh more regen whatever. Offense is not a problem

1135
04:06:51,370 --> 04:07:16,440
right now. Always going to be moving forward. That's uh oh. How far away is this thing? There

1136
04:07:16,440 --> 04:07:43,239
it is. Mow it down. Mow it down. All right go. There's your crit damage bonus. Should I just get

1137
04:07:43,239 --> 04:08:08,069
more health? Yeah. Uh more area. Oh yep. Come on. Additional flame wall and more area. This is maxed

1138
04:08:08,069 --> 04:08:41,110
out. 20% more range and more area. That's maxed out. Movement speed. Holy shit. Trans-transfiction?

1139
04:08:41,110 --> 04:08:45,879
Transfiction? Virus projectile is in the direction you're facing. Damage is reduced for every enemy

1140
04:08:45,879 --> 04:09:02,069
hit. What's that? Is this good? Damage is reduced for every enemy hit. Just get orbs instead. Well

1141
04:09:02,069 --> 04:09:15,989
what about lightning? It's archer as an ability. Do not pick it. Pick this. Pick lightning. Orbs.

1142
04:09:15,989 --> 04:09:20,360
Orbs I think is lightning is the safest because I don't have to think about it. It just will hit

1143
04:09:20,360 --> 04:09:58,299
stuff. Uh crit chance. There's so much shit everywhere. Uh piercing? Does that work for fire?

1144
04:09:58,299 --> 04:10:41,930
I think I'm just going crit. Yeah. All right get it all. This pickup range is such dog shit. All

1145
04:10:41,930 --> 04:10:45,370
right. I'm about to fight the boss. I've not I've not killed this yet. Oh wait. This actually

1146
04:10:45,370 --> 04:10:48,329
will be great against these enemies because these things are so annoying. They just like kind of

1147
04:10:48,329 --> 04:11:11,420
cycle on you. Oops. Oh shit. Oh my god. I'm freaking out. I'm freaking out. I'm all right.

1148
04:11:11,420 --> 04:11:37,610
Everything's fine. Everyone relax. Shit. Oh I'm just I'm just barely barely. I'm okay. Everything's

1149
04:11:37,610 --> 04:12:32,069
all right. I am taking a lot more damage than I should be though. Uh god. Well worst thing that

1150
04:12:32,069 --> 04:13:15,420
happens is. All right. All right. Holy shit. Oh my god. It's just too many. Die you piece of shit.

1151
04:13:15,420 --> 04:13:40,360
Yes. Oh elven slippers. I gotta deposit something. Increases block strength while moving. Builds up

1152
04:13:40,360 --> 04:13:45,659
by moved distance. Block strength is limited to 10. Movement speed buffs increase the cap. Standing

1153
04:13:45,659 --> 04:13:54,180
still remove. I I have to read that like five more times. Increases block strength while moving.

1154
04:13:54,739 --> 04:14:04,100
So I can build up to 10 block by moving around. If I have movement speed buffs that goes over 10.

1155
04:14:04,659 --> 04:14:19,159
But if I stop moving it's all gone. Uh how why would I not have take this. 4% additional damage

1156
04:14:19,159 --> 04:14:24,969
for each burning enemy. That's unbelievable. I hope I don't die instantly after taking this.

1157
04:14:25,610 --> 04:14:39,430
Um I guess just put it in my backpack. Okay here we go. I'm already at the cap. No don't lose it

1158
04:14:39,430 --> 04:15:35,940
right now. Come on. I have to go deposit this. Wish me luck. Shit. Okay. Uh range. I'm gonna do

1159
04:15:35,940 --> 04:16:11,989
range. I have to keep that helmet. It's imperative. Oh fuck. Put it in. Okay. All right.

1160
04:16:11,989 --> 04:16:21,020
I'm good. I'm good. This thing is amazing. It's gonna kill the run but it's okay. Don't. I want

1161
04:16:21,020 --> 04:16:46,409
to put this up. No. I want to put this up here. How do I put that up there? Okay. Geez. All right.

1162
04:16:46,409 --> 04:16:55,959
This is gonna be the end here. Got to keep finding spots to move. Five more minutes of this. I don't

1163
04:16:55,959 --> 04:17:03,659
know about that. We'll see. If there's health I'm just gonna take it. I'm going for healing only at

1164
04:17:03,659 --> 04:17:58,889
this point. There we go. Oh this is not good. Health. Block strength right? Quick. Don't think

1165
04:17:58,889 --> 04:18:05,739
of a pink elephant. Why did you do that? There's a magnet right above you. Pick up range. There is

1166
04:18:05,739 --> 04:18:09,340
a magnet right here. All right. Here we go. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

1167
04:18:09,979 --> 04:18:21,610
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Holy shit. Um even more dragon's breath.

1168
04:18:29,379 --> 04:19:39,379
Oh. Uh. I'm dead. I'm dead. Uh. I'm okay. There's cheese right here. I'll give me a healing potion.

1169
04:19:39,379 --> 04:20:23,530
Yikes. Avoid the slimes. They're the worst. They turn into like five enemies. Huge. I thought the

1170
04:20:23,530 --> 04:20:27,700
pirate image was still up doing the animation. I was about to be like oh shit. How do I take that

1171
04:20:27,700 --> 04:20:51,260
off? Healing. Jesus. There's so many. This way. This way. There's a gap. There's a gap. There's a gap.

1172
04:20:51,260 --> 04:22:13,670
This way. How much time is left? Like a minute right? I don't want to look. 20 seconds. All

1173
04:22:13,670 --> 04:22:38,620
right. I got it. I got it. I got it. Just don't get cocky. Yes. Oh shit. It's a real boss.

1174
04:22:46,899 --> 04:23:52,569
Okay. Well you do that. Oh this is hard. This is hard. Oh man. Damn it. I took a lot of damage

1175
04:23:52,569 --> 04:24:09,100
early. Just learning the move set. That was the downfall. I unlocked a lot of stuff. It's a lot.

1176
04:24:09,180 --> 04:24:32,180
Trait. Stance. Proficiency. Four. I got a lot of money. Ring of fire. This character is good.

1177
04:24:32,180 --> 04:24:48,229
Trait type. Flammability and recovery. Firewalker boots. Sparking tips. Cleric. Oh new character.

1178
04:24:48,229 --> 04:24:57,879
Unlocks upgrades stream of fire. All right. I probably have like five or six grand. Ten grand.

1179
04:24:57,879 --> 04:25:30,219
Cleric. That's so much money. It's so good but I think. What's the cleric? Wooden ring is the best.

1180
04:25:31,219 --> 04:25:36,819
It just. Yeah. It's just great. I'll just get. I want to buy upgrades though. I don't want to buy

1181
04:25:36,819 --> 04:25:48,069
all these items. I want the pickup. Attack speed's great but I feel like I'm lacking. End of the

1182
04:25:48,069 --> 04:25:56,170
stream. No. I'll play. I'll do a couple more. It's a chill stream. The whole stream is end of the

1183
04:25:56,170 --> 04:26:23,110
stream voice. I think this is good for now. I want to do some upgrades. Okay. What did I unlock?

1184
04:26:23,110 --> 04:26:37,899
Health capacity. Did I have that? I think I had that before. Turn on auto aim. It's efficient. I

1185
04:26:37,899 --> 04:26:42,739
had it on for like at the end of the boss fight there. Just trying to focus on dodging the circles

1186
04:26:42,739 --> 04:26:53,000
but I got hit too many times. I don't know what this character is so I'm just going to do some

1187
04:26:53,000 --> 04:26:57,959
basic stuff. I think that's. I mean you can't go wrong with damage and you can't go wrong with

1188
04:26:57,959 --> 04:27:05,989
attack speed. So I guess that's what we're doing before we figure out what this character does.

1189
04:27:06,709 --> 04:27:36,260
You feeling beachy today? Yeah. Whoa. Okay. What kind of damage is that?

1190
04:27:50,579 --> 04:28:01,540
Dun dun. That's a lot of 500. All right. This is if you want to do damage on this

1191
04:28:01,540 --> 04:28:18,620
and attack speed. I'll try the auto aim. Should I plug the controller in? Let me try it with

1192
04:28:18,620 --> 04:28:23,909
the controller. I'm curious. How does it work with controller? How fun is it with controller?

1193
04:28:23,909 --> 04:28:51,000
Because I just have auto aim is on and it moves in my d-pad. It's actually recommended. Much better.

1194
04:28:51,000 --> 04:28:55,959
I do prefer analog moving around with a character like this. Auto and use your thumb stick when you

1195
04:28:55,959 --> 04:29:03,139
want to clear in front of you. Whoa. That's a million times better than what I was just

1196
04:29:03,139 --> 04:29:15,819
doing for the last five, four and a half hours. Well, that's for those of you that want to be

1197
04:29:15,819 --> 04:29:22,969
precise. Uh, then no, but you can be precise. I I'm holding the analog and I'm aiming.

1198
04:29:22,969 --> 04:29:42,260
Is it on game pass? Is it like vampire survivors? I would say it is heavily influenced by vampire

1199
04:29:42,260 --> 04:29:52,040
survivors. Heavily. I will tell you this is probably my this is I'm enjoying this a lot.

1200
04:29:54,090 --> 04:30:03,180
This is I played every vampire survivors DLC. I feel like I'm starting vampire survivors over

1201
04:30:03,180 --> 04:30:10,659
at zero again. And that's something that you just can't do. You can. But I mean, after you have

1202
04:30:10,659 --> 04:30:21,860
hundreds of hours in vampire survivors, I get to start over it on a whole new one. Now that's fun.

1203
04:30:21,860 --> 04:30:42,809
So I can just aim here. Wow. Okay. That's disgusting. I wonder if it's good to do it

1204
04:30:42,809 --> 04:30:57,590
with this character. Let me just see what it does. It shoots out. It's pretty frequent.

1205
04:30:58,149 --> 04:31:22,200
I thought it was going to be a lot slower than that. Clerics cannot crit. That's why they are

1206
04:31:22,200 --> 04:31:34,180
doing so much damage. I see. But I just did. And I just crit. I just crit right there. Wait,

1207
04:31:34,180 --> 04:31:39,059
do you mean the the move there, the actual auto attack that I have? Because I have not seen that

1208
04:31:39,059 --> 04:31:46,200
crit. I got one guide. I don't I have not seen my regular attack crit though. I think they're

1209
04:31:46,200 --> 04:31:51,770
correct. I think they got it right. The abilities can create but my this cannot. I don't think.

1210
04:31:53,399 --> 04:32:25,020
Technically they're correct. More projectiles. Yes. You just start with zero crit. Okay, base

1211
04:32:25,020 --> 04:32:35,000
zero percent. But it's improvable. This is the kind of character I really like to play. I like

1212
04:32:35,559 --> 04:32:48,920
massive damage. But first, I think it's fun. 20% more damage and more range. Yeah. Look at that.

1213
04:32:48,920 --> 04:33:05,750
It's doing less damage. Wait, it's doing more damage based on the distance. Is that correct?

1214
04:33:05,750 --> 04:33:16,950
Am I wrong? I'm trying to figure this out. Splits between the AOE. This is a boss killer.

1215
04:33:20,020 --> 04:33:28,950
It's divided on who's hit. That's a boss killer then. It's doing 400 damage. 600.

1216
04:33:29,669 --> 04:33:39,349
Yeah, that's crazy. So then I should start building crit because then now I have five percent.

1217
04:33:40,150 --> 04:33:44,979
A crit with a thousand damage on a boss would be ridiculous.

1218
04:34:02,580 --> 04:34:20,650
Area. Somebody's first time chatter. I think I'm I think I'm turning into mush. I'm gonna help you

1219
04:34:20,650 --> 04:34:32,020
here. Let me help you out here. Get a glass of water. Drink a glass of water. Sit down. Stretch

1220
04:34:32,020 --> 04:34:38,259
for a little bit. Stretch both your arms up in the air. Stretch up. Kind of puff your chest out a

1221
04:34:38,259 --> 04:34:46,340
little. Stand up. Kind of move around. Let that water really just get into your muscles and into

1222
04:34:46,340 --> 04:34:54,040
your muscle fibers. Make sure you're going outside and you're getting at least five minutes of

1223
04:34:54,040 --> 04:34:59,610
sunshine a day. I don't care what you do out there. Just go out there. Let the sun hit you in the face

1224
04:35:02,169 --> 04:35:12,569
for five minutes a day. At least. If it's really really hot where you are. The sun is just beaming.

1225
04:35:12,569 --> 04:35:22,580
Put on a little bit of sunscreen. Put on a little bit of SPF. You'll be all right. You gotta turn

1226
04:35:22,580 --> 04:35:29,029
that vitamin D into you got you have to synthesize the vitamin D in your body. Let that sun just hit

1227
04:35:29,029 --> 04:35:39,029
you right in the face for a few minutes. Synthesize the vitamin D in your bloodstream. But you can

1228
04:35:39,029 --> 04:35:50,389
take a supplement. You cannot. You cannot supplement our mother earth. Well, our son.

1229
04:35:55,880 --> 04:36:01,849
Is that what he goes? Okay dude. Okay dude. This is. Look at how much damage this does.

1230
04:36:02,490 --> 04:36:19,400
Thousand? I gotta get him alone. Wow. Okay this character is filthy. An iron mouse raid.

1231
04:36:19,400 --> 04:36:26,889
What's up? Thank you iron mouse. Welcome everybody. Thanks for the raid. We're just chilling out

1232
04:36:26,889 --> 04:36:38,630
playing some halls of torment. Thank you iron mouse. Hope you had a good stream. Raid song?

1233
04:36:38,630 --> 04:36:52,470
We did get two raids but it's. No. But thank you. Welcome. This game is sick. It's very good. And I

1234
04:36:52,470 --> 04:36:57,509
believe. Tell me if I'm wrong. I believe the beta comes out tomorrow. The beta for this game I think

1235
04:36:57,509 --> 04:37:01,750
is tomorrow. They're adding a bunch of stuff tomorrow. That's pretty. That's pretty cool.

1236
04:37:01,750 --> 04:37:12,340
Iron mouse loves it. It's great. Yeah. Iron mouse you got great taste. Uh it's it's a wind crown.

1237
04:37:13,060 --> 04:37:33,880
Remind me to deposit this because I'll forget. Show your your your vtuber model.

1238
04:37:33,880 --> 04:38:03,529
Oh you mean this. I mean this old thing. This is. Fuck. Stop it. Stop it. It's allowed to be up there

1239
04:38:03,529 --> 04:38:17,990
for 10 to 15 seconds. It's been way longer than that but it's okay. That's what it looked like

1240
04:38:17,990 --> 04:38:33,849
in real life by the way. I just want everyone to know that. Funny sometimes I'll look in the

1241
04:38:33,849 --> 04:38:49,560
mirrors. I've tried to grow a beard before and it's just it's very it's very hard to do. More attacks.

1242
04:38:49,560 --> 04:39:08,860
Yep. Okay. That's all we needed that for. Any tips on growing a mustache. No my facial hair is

1243
04:39:09,419 --> 04:39:16,389
like I'm like the scarecrow. It's it's like straw coming out of my face. I can't do it.

1244
04:39:18,740 --> 04:39:24,500
It's funny the last like couple of months I've tried but a month will go by and then we have a

1245
04:39:24,500 --> 04:39:32,790
string of 110 115 degree days and I go I can't I gotta get this off. It's it's driving me crazy

1246
04:39:32,790 --> 04:39:35,590
and then another month will go by and I'll be like you know I'm gonna try to grow the beard again

1247
04:39:35,590 --> 04:39:56,389
and then and it's another string of 115 degree days and like get this off me. What's the name

1248
04:39:56,389 --> 04:40:03,770
of your pirate vtuber model. Oh that's easy. Arthur. Everybody that came from Iron Mouse's

1249
04:40:03,770 --> 04:40:11,029
channel you can leave now like that. I get it. I get it. If you're you know that was so all I

1250
04:40:11,029 --> 04:40:21,220
yeah I get it. Like if you want to just take off. I get it. I'm really sorry. If you're here for if

1251
04:40:21,220 --> 04:40:25,750
you're in my community that's here now you can you can leave too. You can leave too. That was

1252
04:40:25,750 --> 04:40:31,060
that was that was a that was a lever. That was a lever. You can that was like you're hovering

1253
04:40:31,060 --> 04:40:43,619
over the X. Yeah it's time to go. I got like dinner to eat and shit. No stay stay stay stay please.

1254
04:40:46,900 --> 04:41:00,810
What was Iron Mouse playing? What was Iron Mouse doing? Wrist Drain. That's another one that I

1255
04:41:00,810 --> 04:41:06,740
really want to. I feel like me and Italics played that for a day or two or me at least stir as well.

1256
04:41:07,459 --> 04:41:12,729
I feel like we played that really really really early in the early access years ago and just

1257
04:41:12,729 --> 04:41:34,580
never played it ever again. Early adopter abandoning Andy. I feel like that happens a lot

1258
04:41:34,580 --> 04:41:41,580
whenever I play an early access game. I play it and I go oh whoa this sounds this looks so much fun.

1259
04:41:41,580 --> 04:41:48,700
This is cool. Oh it's not going to be done for like four years. Oh okay I guess I'll come back

1260
04:41:48,700 --> 04:41:54,470
later and then I just don't come back. I don't know if that's entirely true because I feel like

1261
04:41:54,470 --> 04:42:12,740
there's some early access games I really got into and kept playing later. Yeah name ten.

1262
04:42:15,299 --> 04:42:25,139
Coin game. Was that game in early access? It might it may not have ever been. Oh that's one.

1263
04:42:30,840 --> 04:42:36,700
Vampire Survivors. That was another big one. Yeah I played that pretty much all the way through.

1264
04:42:39,669 --> 04:42:53,049
Ultra Kill. I've played pretty much every Ultra Kill update. There's three. I played the Gloomwood

1265
04:42:53,049 --> 04:43:08,540
demo. I didn't play the early access. Technically you went back to Diablo 4. Oh wait is this a

1266
04:43:08,540 --> 04:43:26,540
Diablo 4 is an early access joke? Oh I see. Let me tell you about Jam. You played the beta?

1267
04:43:29,799 --> 04:43:38,459
Yeah I played the beta. Hey how do you how do you guys feel about Diablo 2?

1268
04:43:39,099 --> 04:43:52,200
Crippling cuts add shots in a backwards direction. I mean I want to see it. Plus 166 base damage.

1269
04:43:52,680 --> 04:44:08,360
I'm not sure which one of these is the one to take. Probably the fourth one. What about Dark

1270
04:44:08,360 --> 04:44:12,759
and Darker? Yeah but Dark and Darker sits in a weird place right now. I'm not sure if that

1271
04:44:12,759 --> 04:44:18,540
game is ever going to release. I mean I don't know the story. I kind of caught up on the first part

1272
04:44:18,540 --> 04:44:24,950
when it was kind of came off steam and everything. Which isn't that's unfortunate because I really

1273
04:44:24,950 --> 04:44:34,099
did I really liked that game. So I don't know what the deal is with that but I I mean me and

1274
04:44:34,099 --> 04:44:38,119
Holly were sitting around talking about it. It's like oh man Dark and Darker I think this is going

1275
04:44:38,119 --> 04:44:42,680
to be the game. This is going to be the game that I play a lot and I'm going to put a bunch of time

1276
04:44:42,680 --> 04:44:48,279
into it. I love it and it just gets fucking delisted from steam. The one game that I talk

1277
04:44:48,279 --> 04:44:53,479
about how much like oh man I'm super excited about it has been delisted from steam and there's like a

1278
04:44:53,479 --> 04:45:06,389
lawsuit now. Oh well I was excited about that one. I think you just like the dark fantasy setting.

1279
04:45:06,389 --> 04:45:17,979
Oh yeah absolutely. Dark medieval fantasy is probably my favorite setting. Have we decided

1280
04:45:17,979 --> 04:45:24,490
which one I'm taking? It's supposed to still be coming out. Well I hope whatever happens I hope

1281
04:45:24,490 --> 04:45:34,279
it gets resolved and I hope we get to see a cool product but yeah we'll see. Take one. One is more

1282
04:45:34,279 --> 04:45:51,770
yeah that's I don't know. I was never a big Tarkov fan but the concept of Tarkov was really

1283
04:45:51,770 --> 04:46:00,299
interesting. That you need to take items with you and if you don't take them with you they're gone

1284
04:46:00,380 --> 04:46:05,979
but you do have a stash. That it was a lot of I don't know it's cool that's cool that you just

1285
04:46:05,979 --> 04:46:09,259
kind of I'm gonna put on all my good stuff and really try this time and then you get killed in

1286
04:46:09,259 --> 04:46:13,180
one hit in the head and you throw your hands up and go well congratulations you just opened up a

1287
04:46:13,180 --> 04:46:38,150
fucking loot pinata and then that we make that person's whole week. I never thought I'd hear you

1288
04:46:38,150 --> 04:46:48,360
talk about Tarkov. I just wish and this is just me being a selfish selfish person maybe it's not.

1289
04:46:49,540 --> 04:46:57,689
I just wish they would stop making shooting games and spend more time making games that

1290
04:46:57,689 --> 04:47:05,849
could work in that world in that sort of shooter br kind of world and I just want I wish we got more

1291
04:47:05,849 --> 04:47:12,520
stuff that wasn't a shooter. Dark and Darker was not a shooter but it followed the same rules as

1292
04:47:12,520 --> 04:47:22,729
a lot of those games that are shooters. Does it hurt being so correct? I don't even know if it's

1293
04:47:22,729 --> 04:47:33,319
a correct or incorrect thing it's just what I want. That's why I said it was selfish. That's

1294
04:47:33,319 --> 04:47:42,060
what I want. A lot of shooters have come out that a lot of people play you know like Valorant, Apex,

1295
04:47:42,860 --> 04:47:48,860
Tarkov. What's that other one? There's another like you know Counter-Strike. I don't I don't

1296
04:47:48,860 --> 04:47:54,779
put Counter-Strike in this category because I think Counter-Strike has been around for so long

1297
04:47:55,580 --> 04:48:01,270
that it just is it to me Counter-Strike just is the shooter. It's just the shooter. It's just the

1298
04:48:01,270 --> 04:48:11,799
shooter to me. Everything else is sort of in a weird kind of cloud above it for me. Overwatch?

1299
04:48:11,799 --> 04:48:27,689
Yeah it was a different it was it was different but I liked Overwatch when it came out the first

1300
04:48:27,689 --> 04:48:32,200
like year or two. I played it all I streamed it all the time. Some of the people that are new to

1301
04:48:32,200 --> 04:48:39,779
this channel might not know back in like 2016-2017 I played Overwatch on stream like once a week.

1302
04:48:40,340 --> 04:48:53,349
I played it a lot. That was a game I played. I enjoyed it. It just kind of started to get a

1303
04:48:53,349 --> 04:49:02,709
little out of hand for me and then Overwatch 2 was just like I don't really I don't see a reason

1304
04:49:02,709 --> 04:49:14,200
to play it. I just didn't really I mean I played Overwatch. I missed this pew. Is your favorite

1305
04:49:14,200 --> 04:49:29,189
Overwatch character? I really liked Zenyatta and Lucio. I thought they were great. He's shit faced.

1306
04:49:29,189 --> 04:49:37,959
I'm not. I liked how they did support in Overwatch. It was fun. It was. Zenyatta was fun to play. It

1307
04:49:37,959 --> 04:49:45,880
was a really fun take on a healer in a shooting game. It was really cool putting that orb on

1308
04:49:45,880 --> 04:49:54,540
people. The healing orb. It was a really well designed character. They made support really fun

1309
04:49:54,540 --> 04:50:03,369
to play in Overwatch but the rest of the game I was not like a massive huge fan of after the

1310
04:50:03,369 --> 04:50:23,049
first year or two. 2016-2018 Overwatch was a time to be alive. It was fun. It was very fun. I sort

1311
04:50:23,049 --> 04:50:36,180
of microbalanced it to hell. I'm not sure if this character is just really good or if I just turned

1312
04:50:36,180 --> 04:50:40,659
my brain off and started playing very well. I think it's probably a combination of both.

1313
04:50:53,180 --> 04:50:58,200
All right. We've not seen this yet. Every 15 seconds you summon a skeleton to fight for you.

1314
04:50:58,200 --> 04:51:15,130
They will perish after a set time but their life force can be extended. I don't know if I can take

1315
04:51:15,130 --> 04:51:27,740
this off. Is 50% attack speed worse than having a skeleton walk around? Oh wait it's a ring. I

1316
04:51:27,740 --> 04:51:41,400
thought it was a helmet. I thought that was a mouth and two eyes. It's a ring. Okay. What should I

1317
04:51:41,400 --> 04:51:52,939
I'm probably gonna say. I just froze for a second. This character doesn't do very many crits so let's

1318
04:51:52,939 --> 04:52:03,560
put this away and put this on. All right let's see what the skeletons look like. One of five

1319
04:52:03,560 --> 04:52:12,939
skeletons. All right there he is. Remind me to deposit this because which one should I deposit?

1320
04:52:13,020 --> 04:52:25,540
Duration? The duration abilities and or summonings. Oh yeah you should put throw a wind crown in

1321
04:52:25,540 --> 04:52:32,380
there for sure. But look at how cool this item is. You mean I could have five skeletons at the

1322
04:52:32,380 --> 04:53:01,779
beginning of the game? That's kind of fun. They're kind of doing work. They take aggro. It's hard to

1323
04:53:01,779 --> 04:53:16,360
tell but they're doing almost 90 damage a hit. I think these things are pretty good. They fight

1324
04:53:16,360 --> 04:53:30,060
off screen. Oh that's a big deal. Look at how huge that is. You know what else I think has made me

1325
04:53:30,060 --> 04:53:38,790
improve? The controller. WASD versus the two analogues. Yeah this is just much easier to play

1326
04:53:38,790 --> 04:54:12,919
I think. Wait is that a skeleton mage? That's cool you can spawn those. You might as well go skeleton

1327
04:54:12,919 --> 04:54:30,169
build. I've got like a 13 minutes left. This has been going very well. Uh movement speed. Especially

1328
04:54:30,169 --> 04:54:38,310
if I'm gonna fight the last boss again. There's no way I'll die in three four seconds. I should

1329
04:54:38,310 --> 04:54:53,130
have enough damage. That'll be what like two or three thousand a hit. Uh oh I gotta just power

1330
04:54:53,130 --> 04:55:06,009
through it. Hey dude your hot pocket is ready. Oh that took a while. How long has it been? Five

1331
04:55:06,009 --> 04:55:50,330
hours? I don't think that it's edible anymore. More duration. I just max it out. It's cold in

1332
04:55:50,330 --> 04:55:57,990
the middle. That was always the worst. I remember I haven't had hot pockets in a while. A long time

1333
04:55:57,990 --> 04:56:04,389
but I do remember you'd get one bite that was burning hot that burnt your mouth and then the

1334
04:56:04,389 --> 04:56:22,810
one right after that sometimes would be lukewarm. But when you got it perfect. When it was when it

1335
04:56:22,810 --> 04:56:27,930
heated up just right. We're talking Goldilocks situation. It is perfect. Perfect temperature

1336
04:56:27,930 --> 04:56:37,560
all the way through. The meatball hot pocket was my absolute gem. I probably lived off of those

1337
04:56:37,560 --> 04:56:44,490
for a significant period of time. I could have if I needed to. You know what else I lived off of?

1338
04:56:47,419 --> 04:56:54,709
Corned beef hash out of the can. I used to eat that stuff all the time. It's like one of my

1339
04:56:54,709 --> 04:57:11,139
favorite foods. Oh shit. All right give me that. Dragon's breath is really good but I don't know

1340
04:57:11,139 --> 04:57:18,709
if it's got all the bonuses. You're not supposed to admit that. What? That I like corned beef hash?

1341
04:57:19,430 --> 04:57:28,709
The canned corned beef hash? Yeah you cook. No not raw. All right how come every time I say a food

1342
04:57:28,709 --> 04:57:35,799
I like you guys assume it is raw out of the box. Oh man I'm you know I really just love a nice

1343
04:57:35,799 --> 04:57:44,810
salmon. Why are you eating raw salmon? What? You said out of the can. Yeah corned beef hash out of

1344
04:57:44,810 --> 04:57:49,689
the can. Because you can get corned beef hash from a ton of breakfast places. You can make corned

1345
04:57:49,689 --> 04:57:55,689
beef hash. It's just corned beef and potatoes and onions. I'm talking about like the Hormel

1346
04:57:55,689 --> 04:58:12,549
corned beef hash out of the can. Not straight out of the can with a spoon. Like no. You put

1347
04:58:12,549 --> 04:58:18,220
an over medium egg on top of a serving of corned beef hash Hormel and then you

1348
04:58:20,979 --> 04:58:36,729
with Tabasco. Get out of here. That's like one of the best things to eat. That's some real

1349
04:58:37,450 --> 04:58:44,779
that's some real good eating. That's good eat. One fried egg on a nice portion of corned beef hash.

1350
04:58:46,040 --> 04:58:54,759
A couple of dupe dupes of Tabasco and maybe some you know what let's get fucking freaky.

1351
04:58:55,720 --> 04:59:01,740
How about a couple of heirloom tomatoes on the side from the oven. Like four or five of them.

1352
04:59:01,740 --> 04:59:22,169
Oof. Get the scroll. All right I'm going. And a whole roast beef? No. Get the scroll dude. I'm

1353
04:59:22,169 --> 04:59:34,840
going. I only got 10 minutes. I'm gonna beat this one. Where'd everybody go? Oh that was weird.

1354
04:59:35,479 --> 05:00:11,900
That was kind of weird. But I do think that D4 is gonna be. All right I'll stop. I am unstoppable.

1355
05:00:16,459 --> 05:00:23,770
Great damage. You've been talking about Diablo for four hours. I've talked about Diablo for

1356
05:00:24,810 --> 05:00:33,610
maybe like 38 minutes total across four hours. It's not been four straight hours. It's been across

1357
05:00:34,250 --> 05:00:42,540
trickled in over four hours. Five minutes here. Two minutes there. Seven minutes there. Six minutes

1358
05:00:42,540 --> 05:00:54,090
here. It's not been the whole time. It's been a portion of the time. What's the best salad dressing?

1359
05:00:56,380 --> 05:01:19,529
Olive oil. Any more questions? I'm just reading chat and just walked through a whole group of

1360
05:01:19,529 --> 05:01:35,319
enemies. Look at that health regen. Tick tick tick tick. That's my health going up. Why do you talk

1361
05:01:35,319 --> 05:01:39,959
about food so much? I think food is one of the most important things that humanity has ever

1362
05:01:39,959 --> 05:01:45,319
created. I think that like food and culture around food I think is probably our greatest

1363
05:01:45,319 --> 05:01:53,990
achievement as a species. People think it's going to the moon. People think it's like no no it's

1364
05:01:55,259 --> 05:02:15,959
the guy that made a pizza for the first time. The first person that's like you know what I'm

1365
05:02:15,959 --> 05:02:24,979
the person that invented baklava. That's kind of remarkable. Look at what we've created with food.

1366
05:02:25,619 --> 05:02:35,130
Look what we've created with food. Welcome to episode two of food for thought. Me,

1367
05:02:35,770 --> 05:02:48,970
grandpile which you know I was thinking the other day who made uh wait this is important.

1368
05:02:48,970 --> 05:02:55,819
Firewalker boots? While you move you produce a trail of fire that damages your enemies.

1369
05:02:57,720 --> 05:03:01,880
Uh I have so many items that I want to deposit but I don't know which one is the cool one.

1370
05:03:06,580 --> 05:03:20,470
This seems incredible to put on the fire character. This one is cool. This one is just

1371
05:03:21,110 --> 05:03:37,270
the best one arguably but this one might be really fun. I can't wait until that's your real voice.

1372
05:03:37,270 --> 05:03:43,750
Well you're gonna have to wait about 40 years. Is your favorite Trader Joe's item still the

1373
05:03:44,630 --> 05:03:52,380
the chicken tikka masala? Yes. Butter chicken does fill it in. They have this new bowl. They

1374
05:03:52,380 --> 05:03:57,110
have these bowls there that are really good now. If you try to move something with your mind. Let

1375
05:03:57,110 --> 05:04:03,770
me try the thing on your desk. Let me try the uh the the matchbox. The the box of matches on

1376
05:04:03,770 --> 05:04:22,619
your desk. Let me try to move them right now. The red ones. The red. Ready? Did it work? Did

1377
05:04:22,619 --> 05:04:33,659
somebody just say holy shit dude stop you moved my house. I'm gonna move the matchbox on your desk.

1378
05:04:33,659 --> 05:04:44,619
I've ripped your house's foundation off and just goes into the air. Uh I'm gonna I'm gonna take

1379
05:04:44,619 --> 05:05:03,419
him because it's fun and whatever. Seven more minutes and I'm good. I'm putting them on. Okay

1380
05:05:03,419 --> 05:05:17,319
so the trail does not last very long but it is cool looking. Are you the reason why the earth

1381
05:05:17,319 --> 05:05:37,509
rotates on an axis? Nah. They're okay. You should play Psychonauts. I was never a fan of just action

1382
05:05:37,509 --> 05:05:52,939
platform games like that. I don't know why. Roughness. Games like Ratchet and Clank I put

1383
05:05:52,939 --> 05:06:00,310
in that same category. Is it wrong for me to say that I put Jack and Jackster, Ratchet and Clank,

1384
05:06:00,310 --> 05:06:07,290
and Psychonauts is in that category? Is that accurate? Because that's as a genre I don't

1385
05:06:07,290 --> 05:06:21,479
usually play. I'm weird. The game I play needs to have weird stakes. It has to be stakes with

1386
05:06:21,479 --> 05:06:32,659
whatever game I'm playing. You really break it down. To me Jack and Jack and Dexter does not have

1387
05:06:32,659 --> 05:06:41,639
stakes. It's just like a fun cool game to play which is fine but I want I needed to be stakes.

1388
05:06:42,279 --> 05:07:00,200
What are the stakes in House Flipper? They're there because in House Flipper without cheating

1389
05:07:02,520 --> 05:07:08,840
you're you're trying to make money to buy the better houses to sell to flip to get more money

1390
05:07:08,840 --> 05:07:13,560
to buy the bigger houses to flip there are stakes there you need to like spend the money you need

1391
05:07:13,560 --> 05:07:20,819
to make money and spend it there's like these negotiations yeah what are the stakes in Elden

1392
05:07:20,819 --> 05:07:28,020
Ring you holding on to souls for too long and losing them that is like the stakes game what

1393
05:07:28,020 --> 05:07:47,270
are you come on gwen come on gwen what are you talking about that's a reach how is it okay wait

1394
05:07:47,270 --> 05:07:55,380
Elden Ring you tell me Elden Ring does not have stakes like something you you have to put it up

1395
05:07:55,380 --> 05:08:01,939
right you got to level up you got to hold on to your souls you got to find items you got to get

1396
05:08:01,939 --> 05:08:08,439
good you could lose shit if you don't if you're not careful where's the next bonfire I don't know be

1397
05:08:08,439 --> 05:08:13,799
careful up that cliff yeah and you goofied off the edge motherfucker what are you doing

1398
05:08:14,360 --> 05:08:29,369
what have you done now you lost everything I didn't mean to call you up and a mother effort

1399
05:08:29,369 --> 05:08:52,729
by the way slipped out you were a cartoon no I just act like one on TV I'm kind of this is going

1400
05:08:52,729 --> 05:09:07,220
pretty well defense I feel like the defense play is what's gonna work here because even if I get

1401
05:09:07,299 --> 05:09:20,619
hit it won't kill me see what happens people said you act like one in real life too oh I mean I

1402
05:09:20,619 --> 05:09:28,659
mess around a lot I mean I think everybody you know when you're around like your friends and

1403
05:09:28,659 --> 05:09:53,819
stuff you kind of just you act like goofy and shit just for fun the magnet oh are you comfortable

1404
05:09:53,819 --> 05:10:02,950
here I think that's why I act the way that I act on stream because it is just like I I feel fine

1405
05:10:02,950 --> 05:10:20,889
I'm feeling cool here well the well the well ooh but what do I deposit I'm coming I guys I just

1406
05:10:21,610 --> 05:10:30,659
I you can't shut me up I'm I just keep I'll talk as long as I'm allowed to don't ever give me

1407
05:10:30,659 --> 05:10:35,799
have I ever go to like a parent teacher conference I will just sit up there with the microphone and

1408
05:10:35,799 --> 05:10:48,060
talk about Diablo 2 items as the parent or the teacher I mean just like in general like that as

1409
05:10:48,060 --> 05:10:52,459
like the parent like oh I'm here to just we're here to because uh the school assemblies we're

1410
05:10:52,459 --> 05:10:57,540
going to hear what they're going to be this year and here's here's the conference where we're going

1411
05:10:57,540 --> 05:11:07,270
to go over like what the students have been doing recently and no I'll I'll just I'll I'll I'll fake

1412
05:11:07,270 --> 05:11:22,569
an illness to not go to them you're going to be dead in a minute um I got two minutes whose dad

1413
05:11:22,569 --> 05:11:31,880
is this yeah we're really excited for the next season of the of the school baseball team uh I

1414
05:11:31,880 --> 05:11:38,040
really was curious this year are we going to be able to have uh are the gloves going to be provided

1415
05:11:38,040 --> 05:11:43,750
or we're going to have to get that as parents hey by the way gloves speaking of gloves I think

1416
05:11:43,750 --> 05:11:48,389
that you should be able to put charge bolt on something besides glove I think you should be

1417
05:11:48,389 --> 05:11:55,349
able to put them on uh let's say for instance cleats uh boots I think that would be it would

1418
05:11:55,349 --> 05:12:04,490
be interesting I think where's my kid your kid's not here this is the parent teacher conference

1419
05:12:04,490 --> 05:12:12,180
oh right anyways Diablo 4 is not good Diablo 2 is the real game and then and then you hear somebody

1420
05:12:12,180 --> 05:12:28,569
somebody starts clapping because one person cares about this well oh shit the well okay okay okay

1421
05:12:28,569 --> 05:12:52,380
okay I'm good I'm good I'm sure I have a cartoon character remember oh shit oh shit what am I

1422
05:12:52,380 --> 05:13:09,750
depositing probably the I don't know the boots seems not that great well that was exactly what

1423
05:13:09,750 --> 05:13:30,069
I wanted to get badly how far away is this I'm not even gonna be able to get there oh

1424
05:13:30,069 --> 05:13:51,099
shit I'm in trouble okay what am I putting in wind crown is just useful for a ton of people

1425
05:13:51,099 --> 05:14:52,759
it just is this is really fun but this is useful this is the one those defense points really did

1426
05:14:52,759 --> 05:16:49,430
come in handy damn all right I got uh-oh that's not what I wanted to do what's he doing why is

1427
05:16:49,430 --> 05:17:03,020
he being so weird what's he doing he's like trying to grab he's trying to grab me I got it

1428
05:17:03,020 --> 05:17:10,250
collect a total of 20 000 golds gradually survive the halls of torment and I picked up something

1429
05:17:10,250 --> 05:17:39,099
so what did I get ability radiant aura money money activity and accuracy money painful incision

1430
05:17:39,099 --> 05:17:56,810
upgrade money false blessing trait money revives that's a great thing to unlock money gold gets

1431
05:17:56,810 --> 05:18:10,619
brewed in barrels and then there's the wraith warlord and grand well this character is amazing

1432
05:18:10,619 --> 05:18:34,790
what does it let me see revives yeah five grand cool these are all very expensive that I unlock

1433
05:18:34,790 --> 05:18:47,189
a new zone all right there's a boss here too but I don't know if I'm gonna get there today actually

1434
05:18:47,189 --> 05:18:57,180
buy the wind crown yeah do I buy the wind crown or do I buy this and have the fire character be

1435
05:18:57,180 --> 05:19:15,750
very good this is good for everybody though yeah everybody can use that there's only one character

1436
05:19:15,750 --> 05:19:39,110
that really can use this 500 000 damage with a lightning strike 500 000 in one go a lot of

1437
05:19:39,110 --> 05:19:45,099
unlockables this is I like this game reach level 100 I feel like you have to have pretty much

1438
05:19:45,099 --> 05:19:50,919
everything unlocked we could probably call it here too it's been like five and a half hours I think

1439
05:19:50,919 --> 05:20:00,069
that's a good place to stop this is great the beta is tomorrow I think and they're adding a bunch of

1440
05:20:00,069 --> 05:20:07,720
stuff so maybe I'll do another killout stream in the next couple days I do want to I want to open

1441
05:20:07,720 --> 05:20:21,979
some tf2 crates too probably maybe Wednesday this week middle of the week Wednesday around

1442
05:20:21,979 --> 05:20:26,840
probably on the same time like five or six keep it at six pacific because I can always pull it back

1443
05:20:26,840 --> 05:20:33,849
like 30 40 minutes if I need to on Wednesday might play some more of this might play a little tf2

1444
05:20:33,849 --> 05:20:54,150
open up some tf2 boxes see you on Sunday no no I'll be live on Wednesday I'll see you Wednesday

1445
05:20:54,150 --> 05:21:06,709
more team fortress Wednesday 6 p.m pacific d2 remastered if I play d2 remastered and I start a

1446
05:21:06,709 --> 05:21:14,299
new character and you guys pick the build that's actually going to end up being a like seven to

1447
05:21:14,299 --> 05:21:31,900
eight o'clock pacific we just we turn it down and just hang out and just play show off your characters

1448
05:21:31,900 --> 05:21:47,590
uh we'll look at this exterminator swordsman archer what about yakuza I want to I want to get my fill

1449
05:21:47,590 --> 05:21:53,930
of this especially if they're going to update it tomorrow so we'll probably this sounds so

1450
05:21:54,810 --> 05:22:04,150
outrageous to say but I'm gonna say it we're gonna open tf2 boxes for like a half an hour

1451
05:22:04,150 --> 05:22:08,740
I might play like a round or two maybe I'll hang out and play some tf2 for like an hour

1452
05:22:08,740 --> 05:22:13,209
and then I'm gonna play this so I'm gonna open up boxes for the first part of the stream that

1453
05:22:13,209 --> 05:22:29,340
feels odd to say that sounds outrageous not too many I just have a ton of crates and cases over

1454
05:22:29,340 --> 05:22:36,500
the last 10 years that I never opened and I just kind of want to open them I've given my tf2 backpack

1455
05:22:36,500 --> 05:22:48,840
away like three or four times maybe I'll get something cool probably like 20 boxes maybe like

1456
05:22:48,840 --> 05:22:58,310
15 to 25 I don't want to go overboard but just enough to you know have a little bit of fun 100

1457
05:22:58,950 --> 05:23:12,360
no 250 I don't even know if I have 50 boxes to open I think I have like 30 or 40 and I don't

1458
05:23:12,360 --> 05:23:17,779
think I want to open some of them some of them are some old crates that I don't even know what's

1459
05:23:17,779 --> 05:23:27,779
really in them all right is series 90 91 and 92 crates any good I have a lot of 89 90 and 91

1460
05:23:27,779 --> 05:23:48,810
are those any good don't open crates open cases there are no good tf2 crates not anymore really

1461
05:23:48,810 --> 05:23:53,529
you said you once said that you would rather have every hair on your body removed with tweezers

1462
05:23:53,529 --> 05:24:08,299
rather than open crates on stream I did well no I said that that's not how long ago how long ago

1463
05:24:08,299 --> 05:24:20,279
though more was it more than five years was it like 10 years ago link the clip I've been I've

1464
05:24:20,279 --> 05:24:25,049
been doing this for too long you guys just have every audio every piece of audio I've said for

1465
05:24:25,049 --> 05:24:32,819
13 years you just have it I don't remember what I said 11 years ago all right so I saw so 10

1466
05:24:32,819 --> 05:24:41,400
years ago I said I would remove every hair in my body with tweezers if I did it or I whatever you

1467
05:24:41,400 --> 05:24:48,040
said it an hour ago I don't remember you saying that you can't seriously expect my client to

1468
05:24:48,040 --> 05:24:59,290
perjure himself over a conversation from 12 years ago that's right do it now or we unfollow

1469
05:24:59,290 --> 05:25:14,889
I'm doing it on Wednesday hey relax it was on the streamer simulator stream from about two years ago

1470
05:25:14,889 --> 05:25:25,380
well things have changed I've changed right things have changed a little I've changed

1471
05:25:25,380 --> 05:25:31,990
I'm willing to open up 15 to 20 crates in team fortress without removing all of the hair on my

1472
05:25:31,990 --> 05:25:48,869
body it's changed it's been two years has it really only been two years yeah I okay post 35

1473
05:25:48,869 --> 05:25:55,479
I can't be like ah you know I was yeah I was like 20s I said that I didn't that was literally like

1474
05:25:55,479 --> 05:26:09,830
I was I was over 35 when I said that but we're still doing it so you've massively mellowed out

1475
05:26:09,830 --> 05:26:17,849
I think that's just kind of natural though I told you guys this the beginning of the year

1476
05:26:17,849 --> 05:26:27,259
I mean it's that I've gotten I've when I started doing YouTube videos I was 25 26 that's when I

1477
05:26:27,259 --> 05:26:37,290
started that's like the the team fortress to YouTube videos I've gone through my 20s

1478
05:26:38,250 --> 05:26:46,979
into my late 30s it's just natural you're just going through the uh the natural order of you

1479
05:26:46,979 --> 05:26:54,979
know dialing it back a little that doesn't mean I still can't have a bunch of fun I can still move

1480
05:26:54,979 --> 05:27:07,110
how about that one oh my arm uh-oh oh boy that's uh that's a blown out elbow that's a blown out

1481
05:27:07,110 --> 05:27:17,720
elbow yeah I'll see you guys on Wednesday thanks for watching thanks for hanging out

1482
05:27:17,720 --> 05:27:44,860
you should have played a loud bone cracking sound do it again what about the la la la la there you

1483
05:27:44,860 --> 05:27:53,619
go I'm not doing that ever again unless somebody says it as a one guy and I read it I do it

1484
05:27:53,619 --> 05:28:09,540
immediately following reading it so I'm never doing that again yeah that this is fun I like

1485
05:28:09,540 --> 05:28:16,599
kind of adding to that it is nice to just kind of relax a little bit I know a lot of people are

1486
05:28:16,599 --> 05:28:23,270
really used to this channel being kind of like crazy I think it really is for the best to do more

1487
05:28:23,270 --> 05:28:33,540
of this yeah I definitely don't want to just only have it be just wacky crazy shit that's very

1488
05:28:33,540 --> 05:28:44,380
unsustainable if you want me to be completely realistic this one was still kind of wacky it

1489
05:28:44,380 --> 05:28:57,340
can be wacky but dialed down a few notches you know what I mean do you prefer this or vampire

1490
05:28:57,340 --> 05:29:06,900
survivors they're both very very good uh vampire survivors has way more content we like the chill

1491
05:29:06,900 --> 05:29:20,040
streams I do too I like them both you can eat pizza but then you can also eat steak and cheese

1492
05:29:20,040 --> 05:29:32,680
sandwiches too they both exist what's something that's too wacky um I don't know it's just the

1493
05:29:32,680 --> 05:29:44,200
vibes when the vibes are wacky it's fun it's also nice to kind of just not do that just relax and

1494
05:29:44,200 --> 05:29:47,959
chill and play games and just talk about stuff it's the vibes with the bat chest exactly you know
