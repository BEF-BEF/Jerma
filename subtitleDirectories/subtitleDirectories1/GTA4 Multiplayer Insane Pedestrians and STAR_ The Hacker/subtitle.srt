1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:11,089
Ugh, I'm not gonna lie. This coffee tastes like somebody flouted in my face.

2
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:26,719
I'm currently trying to get this guy to punch this lady in the face accidentally. He's trying to punch me in the face.

3
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:30,519
I'm trying to get him to hit this old lady, and he's going to eventually.

4
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:42,479
Oh, the germa laugh.

5
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:44,479
Come on, do it again. Do it again.

6
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,429
Knock the lady out again.

7
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:51,429
Hold on, this cop, this cop is shooting him.

8
00:00:51,429 --> 00:01:01,539
I'm moving in.

9
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:06,450
There's the guy.

10
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,170
I'll see you later.

11
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:15,519
How did he get up here?

12
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:17,519
Here come more people.

13
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:26,719
Oh, there's stairs.

14
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,719
Here comes another one.

15
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:31,159
Come on, come on down.

16
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:36,579
You can make it.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,560
Did you think you were gonna make that?

18
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,560
Suspect down there.

19
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,560
Don't worry, I'm going in boys.

20
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,560
Cover me. It's only like a 200 foot drop.

21
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,859
Where was it?

22
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:08,150
Come down here.

23
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:11,539
No, no, please. I don't want to get in here.

24
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:13,539
No, shoot like the fence down for me or something useful.

25
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:15,840
What the heck?

26
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:27,240
I'm gonna wait.

27
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:33,300
Again.

28
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,879
What was he accomplishing by doing that?

29
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,879
You called that guy to help protect you.

30
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,879
That guy just gave his life to save yours.

31
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,879
What happened?

32
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,879
You better be grateful.

33
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,509
I was still clueless.

34
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:56,639
Okay, let the headache pass for a second.

35
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,780
Okay, I was...

36
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:07,009
Oh my god, there's a whole bunch of...

37
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:09,009
Oh my god, here they come.

38
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:12,979
Oh my god, that's terrifying.

39
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:15,919
This is the scariest thing ever.

40
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,919
Let's go, let's go.

41
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,919
Where are they shooting at?

42
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,919
Are they shooting at me or you?

43
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,919
They're shooting at me probably.

44
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,919
Why are my bodyguards not helping me?

45
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:32,120
Oh, here we go.

46
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,189
They're probably shooting at me.

47
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:37,189
What are they doing?

48
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:39,879
Why are your bodyguards going crazy?

49
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,879
No, seriously, leave me alone.

50
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,120
Are they chasing me?

51
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,120
Jerma, you better run.

52
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,120
Because I'm coming for you.

53
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,360
No, I was on your side.

54
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,819
I can't go that way either.

55
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:56,819
I cannot go either way.

56
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:01,430
You guys are chasing me down.

57
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,430
I think they stopped.

58
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,430
No, they didn't, they're sprinting.

59
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,430
They stopped, Jerma.

60
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,669
There better be.

61
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:14,919
I don't trust the one in the back that's crouching.

62
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,920
Take a screenshot.

63
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:22,290
We're going to use this for my album cover.

64
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,790
This guy back here, I don't trust him.

65
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,220
The one that's sitting back here.

66
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,220
I don't see one.

67
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,220
He's crouched, he's permanently crouched.

68
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,399
One just fell.

69
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:36,920
Let's go.

70
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,160
I want to go make sure all these guys are dead.

71
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,160
We can't have any more Unsullied on the streets.

72
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:54,370
Get in, quick.

73
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,370
This is too much.

74
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,639
This is too much.

75
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,639
You went too fast, too quick.

76
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,959
I'm going to die.

77
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,459
I'm going to die.

78
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:31,459
I'm going to die.

79
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,759
You were just dragging around a magnet.

80
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,720
Hello bus driver.

81
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,720
How are you?

82
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,720
It's 7th and 24th street, please.

83
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,720
I would appreciate it if you were on the double, by the way.

84
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,660
I have a kid's birthday party I'm going to.

85
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,660
Thank you.

86
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,660
This looks good right here.

87
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,660
I think I'm going to get out right at this moment.

88
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:14,069
The second your character stepped out of the bus,

89
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:16,310
it was all a hell.

90
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,310
Everything was controlled until that moment.

91
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:24,199
Like the very tip?

92
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:26,199
Yes. Enjoy.

93
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:32,519
I'm going to be fine.

94
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:34,519
I'm going to land right in the water and be completely fine.

95
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,519
Wow, that was amazing.

96
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,519
You have to do that again.

97
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:42,279
That was unbelievable.

98
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:45,800
Hey, this is a good boat view.

99
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Look at the birds up there.

100
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:54,839
I'm in the boat holder.

101
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:56,839
It's the perfect size to be a boat holder.

102
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:01,519
Let's put this up on the shelf, Ma.

103
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:03,959
I'm in the boat holder.

104
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,959
I'm in the boat holder.

105
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,959
I'm going to take my boat out today, guys.

106
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,310
This guy's a fat fuck.

107
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,310
Is that the funniest thing you've ever seen?

108
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,310
I've never seen a guy in GTA that was this gross.
