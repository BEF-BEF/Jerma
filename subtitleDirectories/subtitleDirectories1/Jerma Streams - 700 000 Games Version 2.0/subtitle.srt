1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:13,769
Hi guys, welcome. Welcome to a stream that is gonna be a little all over the place, I think.

2
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:24,149
This is gonna be interesting. You probably saw the title already. This is 700,000 games. No,

3
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:29,989
it is not 700,000 games from a couple years back, or a year and a half, or whatever it was.

4
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:40,820
This is the sequel. This is 700,000 games 2. I'm not just playing the old one. They did it

5
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:50,570
again. They did it again. They packed 700,000 more games into this teeny tiny little disc.

6
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:59,450
How do they even get it in there? So they, over the two versions, have 1.4 million games.

7
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:09,700
Oh, that coffee is very hot. I'm gonna let it sit there for a minute. But yeah, this is version

8
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:16,939
2. I've already gone through and looked at a few things and will touch upon them in just a

9
00:01:17,019 --> 00:01:23,019
matter of mere minutes. So give me one second. I want to, I want to grab another

10
00:01:23,019 --> 00:02:13,819
coaster. So give me one second. Be right back. Okay, so if we take a look at the box,

11
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:18,900
I'm going to show the box now because I want to be able to trickle in because this stream

12
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,569
is a fairly special stream. We're not going to be doing this that often, so. And by

13
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:30,680
often, I mean, we're going until this is done. I'm going to play every single one.

14
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:39,419
Like last time, if there's 700,000 games and I play each one for five minutes, that's

15
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:44,379
seven, 1.4 million, two, three, four. I got, that's, you're talking about probably three or

16
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:52,139
four years of the stream is going to be. So this is probably going to be three year, 20,

17
00:02:52,139 --> 00:03:01,159
a 24 hour, three year long stream. So I'll see you guys when I'm like 40

18
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:09,129
and we get to the last one. So without further ado, why don't we go like this

19
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:22,629
and why don't we go like this? Hi. So here it is. 700,000 games version 2.0. One of the things

20
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:27,110
you're probably noticing right off the bat is the fact that the, the price tag has been

21
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:33,319
scratched off. I didn't do that. That came like this. And as we all know, there are only two

22
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:38,439
reasons why you do that. Either one, the gift was so cheap that you desperately don't want

23
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:42,919
the person to know that it was a piece of shit or you're embarrassed because the gift

24
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:53,610
was too expensive. And I wonder which one this is. Scratch off that price tag. It's a gift. I don't

25
00:03:53,610 --> 00:04:01,289
want you to know how much this was. Both. Now, can you, I don't know. Maybe the company is

26
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:09,259
embarrassed that this was like $11 on Amazon, wherever the hell it is. But yeah, here you go.

27
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:15,349
I'll give you a close up. That's, you see pyramid escape up there. Can't wait for that one.

28
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:20,970
Uh, Mini Golf 3D Mania. Something interesting to know about 3D Golf Mini Mania.

29
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:26,569
Uh, there's a thousand and one Mini Golf Mania levels, which is included in a game. So that's

30
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:30,889
a thousand and one different games. They're using a weird semantic literal definition.

31
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:39,319
And oddly enough, that took about 40 minutes to install. Something else that's kind of

32
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:46,379
funny about this, before we get started, is I did open some of these and why don't we just,

33
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:57,589
I'll just show you. Uh, this is the same exact thing as the last one. Here's the difference.

34
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:04,389
Take a look at the, here, here, all of them. So you see those of you that watched the last

35
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:10,329
video that I did on the first version, I had a lot of problems not being able to open

36
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:17,139
a lot of these. So what this actually is, this is not 700,000 games too. This is 700,000

37
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:26,540
games. But this time, a bunch of them work. This is a patch. They patched in the ability to open

38
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:40,439
half the games you couldn't open last time. Sounds pretty good, doesn't it? Take a look.

39
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:47,720
We got hidden objects, arcade games, brickbuster games, time management games, marble popper,

40
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:54,069
card sports, match three, puzzles. Look at all these boring, terrible games that make up

41
00:05:54,709 --> 00:06:06,709
699,990 of everything that's included on the one disc. So yeah, that, that's pretty much the long

42
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:10,230
and short of it. So what we're going to do is we're going to, we're going to do a little system

43
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:19,110
here. So I'm going to change this to this. I thought about turning on smart click. Uh,

44
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:25,639
there is no way smart click is going to work. You guys are going to have to, like,

45
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:31,379
pick a quadrant if I turn on smart click. There's no way. We will never choose a game. So

46
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:41,509
we're just going to start. We'll do smart click for like an encore at the end. Pick a quadrant,

47
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:49,290
then game. Smart click. I'm just curious of how awful this would be. So hold on,

48
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:56,009
give me one second. Let me change to this. I gotta get, where is it right there? It's copy.

49
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:03,769
So I can make sure I have that on over here. I'm, I'm just curious of how awful this would

50
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:16,550
be if I tried this. Okay. So without further ado, if, if we'd like to see how this is

51
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:22,360
going to work, uh, first I have to turn it on. You're going to have to refresh your page,

52
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:33,740
I think. Okay. It is now active and now I just have to go to it and turn it on.

53
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,980
So you're going to have to probably, if your extension is not there,

54
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:47,370
let's just see what happens. All right. That I super frog is where everybody,

55
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:53,029
it's actually working fairly well. This is not working terribly. This works actually pretty

56
00:07:53,029 --> 00:08:00,699
well. I thought it was going to be a disaster. So we're starting with super frog.

57
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:06,899
Is that what this is? I'm surprised this works as well as does well. I'm shocked.

58
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:23,930
So it looks like we're going to start with a classic video game by the name of,

59
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:30,410
by the name of super frog. Thank you for your participation in this,

60
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:36,740
by the way, uh, need to make one more thing very clear. Uh, RIP to the whole stream.

61
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,860
I'll rip the VOD because we're going to be playing landmines.

62
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:46,580
Some of these are going to crash the entire computer and I'm going to have to restart my PC.

63
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,580
So good luck. Please don't, let's not click on the landmine

64
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:56,389
just through opening and closing certain ones. Oh, this is going to be a disaster.

65
00:08:56,389 --> 00:09:04,200
Hope you, uh, welcome to the spring. Here we go. Let's go ahead and open super frog.

66
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,830
Let's get some nostalgia here. So I'm going to, I'm going to go away because I don't want

67
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:18,809
my face on the screen here, but what I do want is super frog. Yes. That's my desktop

68
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:24,580
background. And by the way, I have lowered the volume by like 50% and it's still going to be

69
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,779
awful. And when you might not even be able to see anything super frog here.

70
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:35,240
All right. This is important. I don't think I should do that. That, that, that might,

71
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:40,940
that's a, that's a, that's a risky click. You know what I mean? Whoa,

72
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:57,909
hold on a minute here. Risky click. Oh, come on. Come on. Oh, all right. Here it comes.

73
00:09:57,909 --> 00:10:06,220
Look at how small this is. I have to make this better. Hold on. I knew I was going to

74
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:15,259
have to do this like a shit load of times and it's so loud. How does it know my name?

75
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:21,110
How does it know my name? I didn't click this. I promise. I didn't open this.

76
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:32,470
I want, I fucking promise. I did not open this game. It's a window. Hold on. Can you hear

77
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:40,059
me? All right. Throw bubble up joke. Okay. We're good. I can't wait. I'm so ready for

78
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:50,139
super frog. What a developer Easter egg. Yeah. Okay. Here we go. Time to play super frog.

79
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:57,740
You only got a taste last time of what this game was like. I had to,

80
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:03,320
I had to play through at least 20 minutes. There it is. Version two. Wait,

81
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:15,159
you can't even see this part. Yeah. We're going to have a lot of fun called every game is

82
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:20,620
going to open in a strange window and I'm going to have to resize them because I can't

83
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:29,909
resize them on the desktop. That's, there we go. All right. Collect all the flowers. Use the left

84
00:11:29,909 --> 00:11:33,350
and right arrow keys to move in the appropriate direction to jump. Press the up arrow key to

85
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:37,590
collect the flowers in the middle of the screen. Reach the highest platform and then jump off of

86
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:52,440
it to the lower platforms using the arrow keys. Desktop background. What is that? I got

87
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:59,909
500 candies. Hey, welcome to the reference stream where I'm just going to make a bunch

88
00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:11,320
of fucking references the whole time. Is this a different level? I thought, I thought it was

89
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:24,570
candies, not flowers. What the hell was that thing? This is the best song. You know, people

90
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:32,440
are like, oh put it on OST. This is the one that I want to listen to. I had to get the

91
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:39,080
banana. There's no double jump just in case you're curious. Just in case you're curious.

92
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,399
To enclose a monster in a bubble to trap it and then press the space bar to send it

93
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:55,259
flying. So it's like bubble bubble. How long should I spend on each one of these? There's

94
00:12:55,259 --> 00:13:03,049
700,000 of these guys, remember. What just happened? I thought I put them in the bubble.

95
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:16,899
I have to pop the bubble. Oh, right. What if I only played Super Frogs? Would you guys be mad?

96
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:40,059
No, you guys wouldn't be mad if I only did Super Frog. I did it, right? Oh wait,

97
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:48,500
the flowers regrow. Oh, that's fucking new. Oh, here are the candies. Wait, is that?

98
00:13:49,139 --> 00:14:04,980
Cockroach up. Oh, fuck. I'm beating the whole game. Restart. No, I'll get them again. Don't

99
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:12,179
worry. I'll say the line. Don't worry. You know what, I'm not going to say the line.

100
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:30,950
Say the line. Say the line. Oh, I should probably turn off the desktop background. Just

101
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:39,370
make it like a black screen, right? That's pretty quick. How many more do I have to do?

102
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,129
Hold on, let's see if I can get it how fast I can get this.

103
00:14:42,009 --> 00:15:01,659
Frog tech. Don't you wish this guy had his own Nintendo video game? Well, he already did.

104
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:09,210
It's called Gex. Enter the gecko, right? Am I not doing it fast enough?

105
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:21,720
I want it in Smash. Monster cleaner. What's going on? How do I beat this level?

106
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:30,139
The fucking flowers. Because they're eating the flowers. I get it. That's a mechanic. Guys,

107
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:35,720
I've only played this game for like fucking four minutes. How? I don't know that. Oh,

108
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:41,850
hold on a minute. Quick zoom in. How could you not? I didn't. Hold on. How could you not like

109
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:53,480
it? It's got candy. See? Reference. That's the line that made me famous. That's where all of

110
00:15:53,480 --> 00:16:01,960
my fame comes from. I said that one time. Now I tour college campuses. I've written

111
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:22,460
a couple of books. So what point do I give up on this one? You never finished that book. Yeah,

112
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:33,159
but I still read it. I don't get all these right now. I'm putting a hole in my monitor.

113
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:48,899
What's going on? Okay, I did it. It's the same thing over and over.

114
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:54,120
What are these? Missiles? Why didn't missiles drop?

115
00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:04,680
Okay, that strange reference. This is a reference stream. That's just the

116
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,920
papers please noise that the guy makes when you click on the thing.

117
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:18,970
T for teen. Actually, there's blood in this game. Not this one, but in this package.

118
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:27,750
All right, that's it. I've been on Super Frog for like 10 straight minutes.

119
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:32,309
We have a long way to go. We had to open it up strong. Very strong.

120
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:41,720
More keep going. No, I'm sorry. We're getting out of Super Frog in about 15 minutes.

121
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:56,650
I'll Frog tech these guys one more time. But if you want, okay, hold on. We talk a lot of shit

122
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:03,109
about this game and this product, but I really can't think of anything better. That's more

123
00:18:03,109 --> 00:18:09,349
just completely benign than this game giving it to like a third grader. You know what I'm

124
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:15,480
saying? This is just the same level over and over again, where you just collect candies and you

125
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:28,519
shoot bubbles out of your mouth. This is so, there's no content here. None. So this is the

126
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:36,890
best thing for like a, okay, little Tim, you get 10 minutes on the computer to play Super Frog

127
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:40,009
and they're going to be like, oh, Super Frog. They don't give a shit. They don't even know

128
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:49,180
what they're doing. They can barely talk. That's worth its weight in gold as a parent.

129
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:58,759
You don't even have to, oh wait, if you're a good boy, then you get Captain Crunch. No,

130
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:01,720
no, no. If you're a good boy, you get 10 minutes of Super Frog and then you pretend

131
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:05,640
like it's the greatest thing in the world. Make sure you get him catching you playing it

132
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:11,400
like I am right now. Comes into the room. Dad, yeah, what's up? Hey son,

133
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:20,279
just playing some Super Frog and then they don't even understand. All right,

134
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:26,150
that's enough Super Frog. Oh yeah, there, there are two new emotes by the way.

135
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:29,509
There's Germa Old and then I turned Germa Expensive into Germa One, guys.

136
00:19:31,829 --> 00:19:38,950
There will be a new Germa Expensive emote. Everyone, papers please, papers, papers, papers,

137
00:19:38,950 --> 00:20:04,920
papers please. Ready? Holy shit. He's going to teach her this is F. What a terrible

138
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:10,069
character design, but that makes it so good. I thought my computer just crashed.

139
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:16,309
Let me, okay, let me change the desktop background to black. So this, like I see

140
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:19,589
Game of Thrones shit in the background. This is not a Game of Thrones background,

141
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:24,789
just in case you were curious. It's not. Let's just change it, personalize,

142
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:35,269
change it to just a solid color. Oh, look at that. Can you see? This is going to,

143
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:44,779
everyone, this is going to freak everybody out so much. Check this out. This is live right

144
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:50,920
now. This is happening. All right, we need to cross off. So here, let's go back to that list.

145
00:20:52,069 --> 00:20:57,880
Oh god, we can't do that again. We can't sit there and play Super Frog for 10 minutes.

146
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,900
You know what I mean? This, we got to make this clear. So I need to add,

147
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:20,359
I need to add an X and just put it over that because we are not going back to it.

148
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:40,470
It's done. Super Frog, I almost put it on the wrong thing. Super Frog is done. All right,

149
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:47,589
shall we pick another one? Let's pick another one. If you'd like to click, we're going to,

150
00:21:47,589 --> 00:21:50,230
just we're going to do this for the first little bit here. Click on where you'd like us

151
00:21:50,230 --> 00:22:02,220
to go next. I'm not going to fucking Super Frog again. I am actually really surprised

152
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:14,680
at how well this is working. We're going to go from Super Frog to Super Fox.

153
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:28,519
What did I expect? Yeah, all right. Super Fox, thank you for participating. If you

154
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:39,990
want to participate, all you have to do is click the screen. Super Fox, it is. Good luck.

155
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:48,920
Oh, this is a full screen game. Uh oh, I have no control. This is in the other one too.

156
00:22:50,700 --> 00:23:07,299
Is there any, can you guys even see this? Oh shit. Uh oh, hold on. Let's see if this works.

157
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:22,099
Can you guys see this? Because this, I can't change this. Is it still just,

158
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:39,259
just a black screen? Can you see this? What does it look like? It's small. I can't fix it.

159
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:46,170
This is how it has to be. I can't fix it because there's no, I can't put this into a window.

160
00:23:53,299 --> 00:24:04,660
Zoom it out again. Oh Lord, hold on. Some of these games are just going to open.

161
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,859
Let's see if that helps. Yeah, it's, it's going to be like this. There's nothing I

162
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:18,710
can do about it. Can you see? Just like look real close into your screen because what's

163
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:31,740
happening is it's changing my resolution across every screen. This is great. Close it up.

164
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:36,779
So you can ride the alligator. You're going to get chased by, I thought he had a dick for a

165
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:41,259
second. I really did. It was like, holy shit, what the hell are they thinking? Here we go.

166
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:51,079
Choose if you want to play single or with a friend. We're going to play single. Pick two.

167
00:24:51,640 --> 00:25:03,609
Choose the level pick you'd want to play. Pick two, pick one. Uh, pick seven. You must

168
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:07,210
reach the gate by jumping through the holes. You can run through the edges of the screen

169
00:25:07,849 --> 00:25:13,339
by using to move, escape to in-game pause. All right. But again, I thought,

170
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:25,579
I hope you guys can see this. All right. So where, where am I? I just killed myself.

171
00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:36,299
How? I'm smashing my skull on the bottom. So this one has presents and cheese and gummy

172
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:46,710
bears. Does that click? There's fall damage. Is that killing me? Okay. I'm running out of

173
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:55,190
lives. I just fucking smashed. How would, why would you make a super Mario game

174
00:25:55,990 --> 00:26:08,259
where you can hurt your head? No, I ain't typing that in. It's going to go up to like some server

175
00:26:08,259 --> 00:26:16,819
somewhere and they're going to know me. Okay. That's out. That's it. Thanks for playing.

176
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:30,150
That's it for super Fox. I'm not doing that one again. That's just, that's not going to

177
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:45,190
happen. Where's, where the fuck is it? So many on here. Okay. I'm not, no more super. Oh

178
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:53,289
damn it. Super. We've only done two. Oh God. I'm going to be here. This the first 24 hour stream.

179
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:02,140
Is it going to be this one? No, no, no, it's not. No way. All right. Let's do it again.

180
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:12,900
Where would you like to go? Oh, you fucking pranksters. Super frog to super Fox to super

181
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:25,539
Fox two. Okay. How much I might as well just go through and do all the supers.

182
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:37,640
I just, I'll just do them because they're just going to win every single thing.

183
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:52,309
All right. Let's play super Fox two. Thank you for participating. What the hell even is this?

184
00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:59,240
Which collection is this in? I knew this was going to happen. Okay. I think it's color is

185
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:15,029
collection three. Yeah. Okay. Super Fox two. Tell me if you can see this. Oh God. It's doing

186
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:19,430
it again. It's loading up the it's fucking up the back. It's what, what's the difference?

187
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:43,140
They just made it. They gave him a different shirt. Look at how fucking small this is.

188
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:48,279
This is like one of, I got a lot of them have actually this one is different.

189
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:56,789
I wonder how closely you guys have to look right now. Chess or Trest hot air balloons

190
00:28:57,509 --> 00:29:03,670
because I can't make it window and I can't get out. It's right now my monitor,

191
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:11,690
my actual, all of the monitors are in like 640 by 480. All right. Look closely because

192
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:18,009
I got a fucked up screen too. I thought the deck tiger was really, really happy that he

193
00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:20,809
killed like a bunch of people. I thought these were all like dead bodies lying around. I don't

194
00:29:20,809 --> 00:29:29,059
know why I went to that immediately, right? That's what I thought it was. I thought he was like

195
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:43,430
looking happy. Check the Nvidia control panel settings. Uh, well what's happening is it's,

196
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,230
right? That's the same problem happened last time I played this.

197
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:53,079
Whereas some of them just force. It doesn't matter what you do. The game physically cannot

198
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:58,180
turn on unless the monitor is at 640 by 480. Remember these games are, these games

199
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:07,380
were made in like fucking two hours each. What happened? And there's your case in point.

200
00:30:09,589 --> 00:30:24,460
This game took 42 minutes to make. And after that we're out. Okay. Well that was fun. And

201
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:32,140
I'm just, I'm just gonna get it out of the way because, oh Jesus, it's still on. We're

202
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:45,660
gonna, I'm gonna open up Super Mole right now. Yes, I know, I know, I know, I know. I know

203
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:54,700
that the mole is the next one that you want to see. I'm certain of it. How is this one?

204
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:59,509
Oh God. All the ones that are Super Mole and Super Fox, they all do the same thing.

205
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:32,140
Damn it. You don't have no options to. It's not bad? It's not that bad? What the fuck is this?

206
00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:48,170
What am I supposed to do? What? Mole movement. Use current weapon. Switch weapons.

207
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:52,759
This is not like the other Super games. I don't like this. It's different. I don't like this.

208
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:58,059
The developers decided to go into like a gem hunting spelunky way. I don't like it. I

209
00:31:58,059 --> 00:32:05,930
want the old Super games. All right. It's weapon hotkeys. Get rid of panels. Suicide.

210
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:26,119
Didn't even give himself a chance. Where are you getting those grenades?

211
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:38,859
This game already exists. What's it called? Uh, Dig Dug. Oh, there's a grenade. Smell the,

212
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:46,490
smell it. Wait, wait, wait. They're gonna crush me. Okay. Watch out. Don't get crushed.

213
00:32:47,289 --> 00:33:05,859
Uh-oh. I just check mated myself. Did I? Fucking 900 million IQ. I like this one.

214
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:15,380
I just, what? I just got like a nuke. What the fuck? Oh shit. I have, oh yeah. I have like

215
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:22,869
bombs. TNT. What is this one? Is it a mine? Poison. Drink poison. I just drank poison.

216
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:50,180
Holy shit. I can go. Okay. It's like a Pac-Man power cube. I like this one. This one's actually

217
00:33:50,180 --> 00:34:00,579
kind of fun. Cool. Enemies. There's no enemies left to destroy. It's not exciting, but this

218
00:34:00,579 --> 00:34:07,220
is a good game. Yeah. You don't die from that. Good. Oh, I have a health meter. Sick.

219
00:34:09,059 --> 00:34:30,710
There's actual thought in this one. That was fun. All right. This is where it derails.

220
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:35,269
How long has it been? Because that's the first one that I think is still open in the

221
00:34:35,269 --> 00:34:47,260
task manager. And if I close it, it might kill the whole computer. Why?

222
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:52,599
Why? No, I think we're fine. No, we're good. No, we're good. We're good. We're good. We're

223
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:58,739
good. Everything's fine, right? I can still change scenes. Oh, we're golden. Let's go ahead and

224
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:13,579
get that over Super Mole. And then we had Super Fox 2, right? Super Fox 2 was down here

225
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:25,420
and we've played four games. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. All right. So

226
00:35:26,059 --> 00:35:44,250
where would you like to go next? Oh, wonderful, lovely audience of mine. We're in this together.

227
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:51,670
Oh, yes, we are. I'm seeing a lot of, uh, it's more so now that there's no more

228
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:59,510
Super in the title seem to be pretty evenly split except for fish food, which is the

229
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:06,150
next one we're going to play. So let's go ahead and open up fish food. Hopefully this one

230
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:17,320
has even a full screen graphic option. That would be very nice. Now I get to do the fun

231
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:23,110
task of finding where the fuck that game is. Okay. Found it. Fish food. Let's go.

232
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:28,860
If you think this is going to be even remotely close to insane aquarium, you are,

233
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:42,170
you are so wrong that it's actually making me angry. Let's do it. Yes. Yes. Thank God.

234
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:50,059
What? Why would you have a maximized window if it doesn't do anything?

235
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:59,690
Oh my fucking God. It just increases the window.

236
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,320
When did this come out? I'm, so hold on a minute. Let's be fucking serious for one second.

237
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:15,030
When did this come out? Two. Okay. This is designed for windows seven and windows eight.

238
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:20,550
Okay. Why would you have a six 40 by four 80 window in like 2013?

239
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:30,869
Did you just hit the pinnacle of where you are able to design a video game and you just

240
00:37:30,869 --> 00:37:36,039
don't even attempt to go any further. This game came out probably in like,

241
00:37:37,019 --> 00:37:41,099
did this come up this year? What's the copyright on it? 2014.

242
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:47,909
And you're still making fucking six 40 by four 80 windows. You can't like fix this.

243
00:37:49,030 --> 00:38:00,539
Well, I, I'll try. What the hell is muse on? What's this fucked up weird, like

244
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:18,440
out of the scene in Adobe flash Easter egg affiliate link. All right. Fuck it. Let's go.

245
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:26,250
How to play meet Sonny is small. See that you guys have it, have it easy. I got it hard

246
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:30,650
because I have to look at the fucking screen that is under a microscope.

247
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:36,059
Fast ocean. Use your mouse to help Sonny survive in these dangerous waters. Follow

248
00:38:36,059 --> 00:38:39,579
these rules. Eat the fish smaller than yourself. Avoid the fish bigger than yourself.

249
00:38:39,579 --> 00:38:49,980
Eat enough fish to grow up. That's an overworld. Meet Sonny. Look at this.

250
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:55,000
All right. Fish frenzy has more levels than Donkey Kong country.

251
00:38:55,639 --> 00:39:01,900
Something's wrong there. Did I already eat something? And you get the mouse on the screen

252
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:22,199
too. You got me so far. I can eat these guys. I'm going to get gnomed. No,

253
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:26,440
I'm not going to get gnomed. This was so easy. This is level one though.

254
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:38,300
What I get gnomed in this. The gnome didn't even exist until like 16 months ago. I don't

255
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:45,929
know why I'm referring to the gnome in baby years. Like how old a baby is golden fish.

256
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:55,059
Wow. I just got gnomed. It just happened. You just saw it on the screen. I just got fucking

257
00:39:55,059 --> 00:40:08,409
gnomed. All right. Let's speed run this. I wonder how far I can get before fucking raging.

258
00:40:08,409 --> 00:40:14,099
Oh, he's going to rage. Hey, place your bets guys. What's it going to rage?

259
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:29,699
This is not what I thought the game was going to be like. I kind of need to see.

260
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:38,300
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What's with all this stuff?

261
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:49,940
Uh, toxic waste dump. What's with the, what's with the bomb over here? Am I going to get to choose

262
00:40:49,940 --> 00:41:02,340
two different paths? Going through toxic waste, die by a whale or like nuclear explosion.

263
00:41:06,389 --> 00:41:12,489
This is important. Oh wow. We got big guys. We got big guys. He can, he can grow too.

264
00:41:13,449 --> 00:41:16,170
God, this just reminds me of BBB so much. You know what I mean?

265
00:41:16,489 --> 00:41:25,960
I'm getting some real, like it's itchy. I'm getting those real BBB vibes. Uh-oh.

266
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:43,239
Gnome me. Don't gnome me. We're going with first death. Game over. Hope you guys are aware of

267
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:55,639
that. Can I beat this whole game in one setting in about nine months? This is going to be so

268
00:41:55,639 --> 00:42:03,989
long. I want to see what happens when we get to the nuke, but the difficulty is going

269
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:06,630
to ramp up. They don't want anyone completing the game because guess what?

270
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:10,789
There is no completing the game. After level 16, there's nothing there. It's that's just

271
00:42:10,789 --> 00:42:18,599
there. It'll be a liar. I didn't count. I'm 11. They didn't develop past like level 12.

272
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:30,710
That map is not going to work after 12 levels. I guarantee it. Guaranteed. You see that needle

273
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:46,460
threat right there? Nobody, none of you, nobody in this chat could do that. I'm surprised

274
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:53,619
nobody's made the joke in this chat yet. It's pretty easy. First game that Jeremy's been

275
00:42:53,619 --> 00:43:17,099
able to get S ranking on. Where is that? I haven't seen that yet. Go. You just got,

276
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:34,619
okay, I'm gonna, I'm gonna speed this process up. Come on, I can do this quick.

277
00:43:39,880 --> 00:44:00,630
He ate them all. That's not fair. Get out of here. Ah, GDQ run. Doesn't matter. Yeah,

278
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:06,309
it does. I'm about to escape. This game, this actually, I don't know why that hurt my back,

279
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:21,800
but it did. Just don't touch a whale and I'm good. Oh, what a perfect use of that

280
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:32,309
emo. Yeah, after God. I'm losing growth is what's happening. All right, that's enough. I'm done.

281
00:44:33,269 --> 00:44:42,099
We're gonna be sitting here for so long. Get to the toxic waste or riot. One, two, three,

282
00:44:42,099 --> 00:44:52,940
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. That's 11 more levels. Yeah, that is actually kind of

283
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:59,420
funny. There's two endings to the game. One where I become a gigantic fish and I win and

284
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:10,949
the other one where a nuke goes off. Very interesting stuff. I'm not gonna win. I'm

285
00:45:10,949 --> 00:45:29,769
gonna lose here. That just, that was the button to click to add like two minutes to this game.

286
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:41,340
Thank God, because that music was gonna be the reason to hit escape.

287
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:59,179
No, that's it. I'm done. I can't leave again. How do I leave? I think I have to just click

288
00:45:59,179 --> 00:46:10,219
the X. No escape. This, I probably have to beat the level to go to the menu.

289
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:15,619
It's not even gonna be toxic waste. It's just a thing on the map that somebody drew and put

290
00:46:15,619 --> 00:46:23,929
there. Haven't you ever played a game? Haven't you guys ever played a game before? Haven't

291
00:46:23,929 --> 00:46:38,010
you guys ever played a game with as an overworld? Yeah, it's a phone game. In Candy Crush,

292
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:42,329
you do the same thing over and over and over again and then you walk by the clown with

293
00:46:42,329 --> 00:46:46,489
the funny pink hair and he doesn't, like, there's no clown. There's mines here though.

294
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:59,750
Well, this was fun. This was a fun one. What am I talking about? Look, these are mines.

295
00:47:00,469 --> 00:47:19,960
You're already halfway to the waste. They're the same four enemies. We're not going to

296
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:31,610
even get to see a new enemy type. It's the same spongebob fish. It's over. Say, I was

297
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:41,510
trying to circle that guy and I forgot. It was that one. That was a super fish. What the

298
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:51,369
fuck was that one even called? I don't know. That one was called fish food and it is now over.

299
00:47:51,929 --> 00:48:07,530
Where are we going? See, now it's split. I'm gonna have to sit here for a minute or two

300
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:19,019
because this shit is locked down. All you fucking guys clicking on feeding frenzy

301
00:48:19,579 --> 00:48:26,059
that want to see the same game again, but this time the fish is green instead of yellow.

302
00:48:26,539 --> 00:48:38,949
Spy chaser. This one's probably... I think I remember this one. This one's 3D. We're going

303
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:49,099
spy chaser. Yeah, this is a 3D game which means it's probably gonna fucking crash the computer.

304
00:48:49,099 --> 00:48:54,340
This might be the first landmine of the evening, so I'll be right back if it crashes.

305
00:48:55,500 --> 00:49:07,079
Thanks for voting. And where is it? Spy chasers. It's pack two, I believe. Spy chasers. Okay.

306
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:18,489
Is that not it? No, it is. What the fuck is it? Spy chasers. There it is. All right,

307
00:49:18,489 --> 00:49:31,210
here we go. Good luck. See you. See you maybe in like a minute when my computer blue screens.

308
00:49:31,210 --> 00:50:19,579
Huh? Are we good? Is it open? That was spy chaser. Pretty good. Pretty fun. Where are we going

309
00:50:19,579 --> 00:50:37,130
next? I thought they fixed all these. All right. Somebody keep... Somebody jot it down.

310
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:42,389
Somebody keep a mental note somewhere of the ones that didn't work. I guess I could just do

311
00:50:42,389 --> 00:50:50,460
that. I have a monitor right here. So, because I want to see if I can go into like

312
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:55,500
the fucking game like I and I files or something and try to like force that to open.

313
00:50:55,500 --> 00:51:02,440
Okay, spy chaser was one of them. Just write it on the monitor.

314
00:51:05,579 --> 00:51:12,820
I could just do that, right? Just half like... But no, I like... I can't...

315
00:51:16,789 --> 00:51:21,659
No, there's no reason for that. I can just write it here. All right,

316
00:51:21,659 --> 00:51:31,639
looks like we're going feeding frenzy. Let me click on monster doors. Is it too far over?

317
00:51:33,639 --> 00:51:43,349
Hahaha. Let me click monster doors. What are you doing? What the fuck? Fuck. File Arter.

318
00:51:43,349 --> 00:51:47,030
It's cool. I told you Dutch made that cool again to like be able to like

319
00:51:47,030 --> 00:52:00,760
voice crack. It used to be not cool. All right, we're going to feeding frenzy.

320
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:14,869
You can't wait. Looking forward to it. Yes, I'm sure. I'm sure I want you to open this.

321
00:52:15,429 --> 00:52:23,780
It's like, are you sure you want to open that file? I guess. Here we go. Well, this

322
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:43,050
one opens. That's a Harley Quinn without any makeup on. Options. Wait, what? This is the one

323
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:54,650
this is the fast one, but it's so small in the corner. Wait, wait, wait. I might be able to fix

324
00:52:54,650 --> 00:53:05,539
this a little bit. Let me see if I can fix this. If I go like this and then move it down like

325
00:53:05,539 --> 00:53:09,989
that, you guys are going to tell me if this helps at all because there's no way I'm going

326
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:28,650
to be able to know. It kind of did. It kind of did, right? All right. So game speed. Yeah,

327
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:33,369
it's as fast as possible. And here's the thing that I did this on a different computer that

328
00:53:33,369 --> 00:53:51,139
time. Is this supposed to be ash? All right, here we go. Go fishing. Oh God, it's going to

329
00:53:51,139 --> 00:54:00,010
do it. I know it, but I'm at like probably 3000 frames a second. Oh my God. It just

330
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:22,460
crashed. What the fuck is happening? No, why? Oh my God. What the hell was that for?

331
00:54:24,789 --> 00:54:52,340
There's no reason for that. No, it's doing it. I get Jesus. This collection came out in 2014.

332
00:54:52,340 --> 00:55:31,030
That was not like three decades ago. Oh my God. Why? My head hurts. This is supposed

333
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:45,429
to be version two. How is that version two? Somebody just dragged and dropped a folder into

334
00:55:45,429 --> 00:55:56,630
a new folder and named it two and then sneezed in the thumb drive. My God. Okay.

335
00:55:57,429 --> 00:56:04,199
Um, I'm going to write that one down too. So, uh, feeding frenzy also didn't fucking

336
00:56:04,199 --> 00:56:08,920
do anything. Well, it did do something. It, it turned on a Halloween strobe light

337
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:14,630
into almost 6,000 people's faces. Can you imagine how fucked up that is?

338
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:22,409
What I've just done on the stream. I did, there is a stadium here full of people

339
00:56:23,610 --> 00:56:41,500
that I just flashed and then I walked off the stage. All right. I think, I think people

340
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:45,900
are trying to click down on monster doors, but maybe they can't.

341
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:54,579
Is everybody like, all right, I'm actually concerned about that.

342
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,699
How would I ever know that opening feeding frenzy was going on?

343
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:09,659
What the fuck is this big frenzy from now on here on out, I'm just going to flash myself.

344
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:17,929
Okay. So I'm not going to change over to the game until I'm certain that like it looks all

345
00:57:17,929 --> 00:57:25,190
right. Well, wait a minute. Hold on. Now we've got, okay. Big frenzy. So big frenzy's looks

346
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:35,909
like it's going to be the one that wins 50%. Thank you for voting. Okay. Big frenzy. This

347
00:57:35,909 --> 00:57:43,940
one is in best video game hits four. Big frenzy. I'm not changing this over yet. Well,

348
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:50,789
I am actually for a second because I need to. So hold on. I feel like we, I like the

349
00:57:50,789 --> 00:57:54,070
camera being on like, I feel like takes us into another dimension. Like we're already in

350
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:57,590
like a fucked up dimension and bringing it back to reality for a second. So just hold on.

351
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:05,559
I'm still in pain from that flash. That's the fucking worst thing I've ever seen.

352
00:58:07,579 --> 00:58:12,250
All right. Let's make sure this is actually going to be captured.

353
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:29,159
Okay. Big frenzy. Please, please just spare us. Spare me because I'm the one that's

354
00:58:29,159 --> 00:58:37,219
looking at it right now. All right. Okay. This has, this has video options.

355
00:58:38,019 --> 00:59:17,349
It's, I can't make the screen bigger. Brightness medium. That should make it a little better.

356
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:29,000
Come on back to me. Bug, bug man. What about bug frenzy? It's a little better. Holy shit.

357
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:35,130
This is fucked up. This is not right. This is not right. Oh, I don't know why this

358
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:41,239
happened. I just, it just reached into the fucking computer screen through and like

359
00:59:41,239 --> 00:59:49,059
choked me. It fucking crashed. I just actually got strangled by that game.

360
00:59:49,059 --> 01:00:06,329
Okay. It looks a little better. Could be better though. That's as good as it's going to get.

361
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:18,199
Start. It was nighttime. The firefly flew around the garden collecting glowing eggs.

362
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:28,679
Why is this written in shitty chalk? Okay. Is that what, is that what the bug did?

363
01:00:38,619 --> 01:00:44,300
Am I dead? Oh, that was actually kind of brutal.

364
01:00:46,469 --> 01:01:10,920
Okay. We'll try it again. I'm going to try to get every single crunch berry.

365
01:01:14,179 --> 01:01:16,949
That's a song. What popular song is that?

366
01:01:24,699 --> 01:01:29,019
What is it? Oh my God. It's going to, it's, it just strangled me.

367
01:01:37,179 --> 01:01:49,510
It's tonight's going to be a good night. No, no, this is not the top

368
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:59,780
one most embarrassing spring. I'm so quirky, right?

369
01:02:08,789 --> 01:02:19,829
I did it. So we do it again. I'm not stopping until somebody puts in the chat what this song

370
01:02:19,829 --> 01:02:42,090
is and what interlude this is. No, it's not again and again. It's for you and then you

371
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:47,610
and for you and for you and for you and for, is this wrong? What am I doing? Is that wrong?

372
01:02:48,809 --> 01:03:06,980
I got a feeling that tonight's going to be a good night. No, it's not.

373
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:49,750
What's this thing do? Oh, I have another life. I was going to,

374
01:03:56,519 --> 01:04:02,519
how many more is this? Last one? Only like one more little quadrant up here

375
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:05,000
and then we can finally get this shit going.

376
01:04:11,670 --> 01:04:13,110
All right, get me the fuck out of this.

377
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:26,679
That was, I don't even know what that was. I forget what that was already. That was

378
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:39,590
Bug Frenzy? Where the hell is it? There it is. It's been an hour. That was Bug Fuck?

379
01:04:40,619 --> 01:04:46,900
I don't think the title of that game was Bug Fuck. I'm pretty sure it was Bug Frenzy.

380
01:04:48,869 --> 01:04:53,429
All right. Where are we going now? I know you can't click on the bottom of the screen,

381
01:04:53,429 --> 01:04:57,610
but I'm sorry. There's not much I can do about it. These are like five separate

382
01:04:57,610 --> 01:05:11,800
images that I had to staple together. Never has no one ever. It's never have no one ever by the

383
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:25,320
Smiths. All right. I don't know if this is Gerbil Quest or Monster Doors, so I'm going

384
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:45,929
to say it's Gerbil Quest. Let's open up Gerbil Quest. Again, all these fucking things.

385
01:05:45,929 --> 01:05:51,059
I just wish, here's the worst part. Going through this the first time,

386
01:05:52,739 --> 01:05:56,900
like I could like set up the capture again. I could change the window. I'm going to burp

387
01:05:56,900 --> 01:06:04,010
real loud. No, I'm not. Okay. Here we go. No, I'm going to turn it off because I don't want you

388
01:06:04,010 --> 01:06:15,179
to see this because what if it's a fucking flash? Oh, did Gerbil Quest not open?

389
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:47,000
Trying to. Write it down. Gerbil Quest does not open. So that's why Chaser Feeding Frenzy

390
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:54,550
Gerbil Quest. See if we can get this to open later for the encore part of the stream.

391
01:06:56,409 --> 01:06:59,849
Uh, looks like everyone wants Monster Doors because you can't go any lower.

392
01:07:01,530 --> 01:07:08,570
Monster Doors or we riot. You're going to get your Monster Door or it might be a land mine.

393
01:07:09,909 --> 01:07:28,920
Monster Door. Incoming. Let's try it. Monster Door. We're good. No, we're not. It's a land

394
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:41,860
mine. Fuck. It's a land mine. It's up. No, it's not. Thank goodness. I'm scared to do that.

395
01:07:45,369 --> 01:07:56,539
No, we ain't doing that. No way. Do you think I'm going to full screen that game?

396
01:07:57,500 --> 01:08:02,949
Dad, talk about a door I don't want to open. That one. All right. It's off center. Someone's

397
01:08:02,949 --> 01:08:06,550
going to be like, it's off center-ree. It's off center-ree. Right? Someone's going to do

398
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:10,420
that. I know someone's going to write that. Okay. We're good.

399
01:08:16,489 --> 01:08:26,949
That's an exponential increase. All right. You ready? Monster Doors. Classic original puzzle

400
01:08:26,949 --> 01:08:32,390
with one figure to collect. Two by two. Every fourth level you'll get a new figure to collect.

401
01:08:32,470 --> 01:08:40,010
I don't know what that means. Level one. Points to pass a level 160.

402
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:52,539
Collect figures. Monsters. This jester's bonus figure. I don't understand what's going on.

403
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:16,939
So they come out of the barn floppy disk doors. What's the goal? This is Hotel Mario.

404
01:09:18,939 --> 01:09:29,319
But what the number muncher is monsters. I don't have a score yet. Score yet. So they have

405
01:09:29,319 --> 01:09:37,460
to... that's not a score? Wait. Hold on. I think I get it. That's a four in a row, right?

406
01:09:37,460 --> 01:10:00,810
Jackpot. I need a green down here. Got it. Five in a row. Jackpot. Nope. I need a green right

407
01:10:00,810 --> 01:10:18,659
here. Got it. Watch this shit. Bingo. Oh no. That's not going to happen. Uh. How am I

408
01:10:18,659 --> 01:10:26,010
supposed to set this up? I need one. There's too many greens. Too many green figures.

409
01:10:26,569 --> 01:10:39,159
Just make a square. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. I get it. Okay. But I'm looking at the bonus game.

410
01:10:46,180 --> 01:10:51,699
Oh I get it now. Watch this. I'll fucking run through this shit.

411
01:11:08,899 --> 01:11:22,760
This is fun. I like this one. That's what I was trying to do right there. I get a double.

412
01:11:27,109 --> 01:11:33,590
I did it. I beat the level. I win. All right. Now that I know what's going on. Watch this.

413
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:39,300
Yeah. Oh wait. Look out. Oh shit. It's uh. It's the birdie from Five Nights at Freddy's.

414
01:12:39,300 --> 01:13:18,170
Why is nobody clicking on the screen? That's you.

415
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:41,859
VeggieTales? Where's the VeggieTales one? You want me to play 100,000 Mahjong games.

416
01:13:41,859 --> 01:14:03,770
Okay. That looks like the place we're going. I click. Wait. Am I saying it wrong?

417
01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:10,680
It's. It's Mahjong, right? Mahjong? Mahjong. It's correct, isn't it? Am I doing it wrong?

418
01:14:17,899 --> 01:14:29,659
All right. Let's open it. 100,000 Mahjong games. Let's see what happens here. Let's get it open.

419
01:14:29,659 --> 01:14:41,020
All right. Look at this. Oh wow. So interesting to note about this one in particular. This is

420
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:59,930
very important. This is the Windows 95 logo. It might even be Windows 3.1. They just don't

421
01:14:59,930 --> 01:15:05,420
give a shit, do they? I have no idea how to play this. I don't know what any of this

422
01:15:05,420 --> 01:15:10,060
means. I've never done it before. I think maybe I think one time I watched my brother play it

423
01:15:10,859 --> 01:15:23,829
and you have to match symbols or something, right? Match tiles because and they're layered.

424
01:15:23,829 --> 01:15:45,239
So I gotta find this. I gotta find these two. I'm gonna wait for it

425
01:15:45,239 --> 01:15:51,159
until somebody figures out what I'm doing. Just gonna hang out here for a second.

426
01:16:07,130 --> 01:16:10,329
Oh yeah. I was right. You have to match them. Okay. So get out of here. Get off

427
01:16:10,329 --> 01:16:15,289
the screen. Get out of here. I don't need that. I'll figure it out. It's just here we go.

428
01:16:35,619 --> 01:16:56,819
What on earth are you guys clicking right now? All right. Hold on. I can do it.

429
01:16:56,819 --> 01:18:06,739
No one's on here. I'm just being silent right now. I'm being so quiet. It has to be on the edge.

430
01:18:06,739 --> 01:18:19,100
Got it. Sometimes you just figure out that you're really good at something.

431
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:32,680
What? That's on the edge. It's a nice interesting game. So where are the 100...

432
01:18:33,319 --> 01:18:48,260
Okay. Are there 100,000 pieces? 3D? Wait. What? This is so much easier to see this.

433
01:18:50,939 --> 01:19:07,500
This is 3D. This is 2D apparently. What did I just do? Let me like use my finger.

434
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:17,640
Hold on. I gotta use my finger. Like I sometimes I need to use my hands

435
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:22,310
because I got a top screen here. So I'm gonna make sure you guys can see what I'm doing.

436
01:19:22,949 --> 01:19:47,819
I used to be pretty good at this. One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, five, six.

437
01:19:48,539 --> 01:19:57,659
These two. Those two. These two. Right there. Those two. Those two. These two. Six,

438
01:19:57,739 --> 01:20:03,770
seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen. Okay. I'm kind of stuck here though

439
01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:15,609
because there's a couple of different ways to sit in eight, nine. Okay. Now I can do really

440
01:20:15,609 --> 01:20:26,569
quick math in my head. So green into green and then the red into red and then the black

441
01:20:27,289 --> 01:20:49,159
frame into the green and then... Okay. Okay. That was kind of hard. It was like

442
01:20:49,880 --> 01:21:01,779
touching the screen is like hard to do. But I got it. That was fun. What a god of a game. I mean,

443
01:21:04,090 --> 01:21:08,789
stop. Let's say that. Not really. Kind of. I mean, you know, sometimes. I mean, you know,

444
01:21:08,789 --> 01:21:24,520
whatever. Thanks for the compliment. That was a hundred thousand mahjong games. Computer loadup

445
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:40,470
celery man. What? You lost 300 viewers playing mahjong. Well, let's be honest here.

446
01:21:41,189 --> 01:21:47,859
If you clicked on a live stream and a guy was playing mahjong on it and it was on the screen

447
01:21:47,859 --> 01:21:53,779
for more than 10 seconds, you'd probably be like, ah, I don't know if I want to watch a

448
01:21:53,779 --> 01:22:00,779
guy play mahjong and you'd probably just leave. All right. Where are we going now? What do you

449
01:22:00,779 --> 01:22:13,640
guys think? Oh, are we, are we considering another 3D game that's guaranteed to either

450
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:33,350
not work or crash OBS? I'm looking forward to it. Why does nobody like Adam Ball?

451
01:22:33,590 --> 01:22:43,779
Adam Ball. There's the Pac-Man clone. That one's from the last one, too. One vote is currently

452
01:22:43,779 --> 01:22:54,180
on. One vote is currently on. All right, let's open it. This is, uh, what the heck is this one?

453
01:22:54,819 --> 01:22:59,449
Which one are you clicking on? Mystery World War II aerial dogfight. I remember this one

454
01:22:59,449 --> 01:23:03,609
was in the other one, too. It has really loud music and impossible to control. Welcome

455
01:23:03,609 --> 01:23:20,380
to the reference. Here comes a reference. Thank you for voting. Let's just redo the video.

456
01:23:20,939 --> 01:23:26,600
All right. I'm going to make sure the screen is not, uh, going to be terrible here.

457
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:38,409
What the hell is OBS? Where did OBS go? Oh my, that was kind of scary. All right. Let's,

458
01:23:38,409 --> 01:23:42,250
I'm not going to change it yet just in case it's all fucked up. And we have video

459
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:56,710
options. So resolution, field of view, big. This mic. Okay. You take a look at this and

460
01:23:56,710 --> 01:23:58,789
you tell me if you think this is going to crash the whole fucking game in the whole

461
01:23:59,670 --> 01:24:12,920
stream. Not me, not my face. This. I mean, resolution, scene detail, shadow reflection,

462
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:19,239
cool effect if enabled, if special effects is enabled, 3D sound, hardware sound. This is

463
01:24:19,239 --> 01:24:27,460
just all these boxes are ways to crash my computer. Think of the amount of troubleshooting

464
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:43,449
it would take to potentially have to deal with all these checkboxes. Good luck. I just

465
01:24:43,449 --> 01:24:57,289
clicked it. Oh, it worked. Yeah. This is the same one. I remember this one,

466
01:24:58,010 --> 01:25:12,579
the loud ass music. All right, hold on. I can make it look better. That's as good as

467
01:25:12,579 --> 01:25:20,920
it's going to get. Oh no. No, wait, didn't this happen before? This happened last time.

468
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:25,319
It cracked. This happened in the video. It crashed the computer. I remember. And

469
01:25:25,319 --> 01:25:28,920
I finally got it to work. It's over. It's done. This happened in the last fucking,

470
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:42,250
in the video. No. Oh my God. I can't fucking believe it. That just relived it. Oh, you gotta

471
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:53,689
be kidding me. God damn it. Go pull up that video. Watch this part. This exact same thing

472
01:25:53,689 --> 01:26:11,220
happened. I had to restart the computer. I think. Fuck. Hold on. Oh shit. I think I

473
01:26:11,220 --> 01:26:20,649
can get it. Can I just kill it from here? It might kill OBS. No. Oh no. No. Don't

474
01:26:20,649 --> 01:26:50,340
kill OBS. Good luck. I'll see you guys soon. Hopefully. If it doesn't. Hello? Where's the

475
01:26:50,340 --> 01:27:22,149
webcam? Am I still here? Uh, what? I didn't do that. I didn't do that. What happened

476
01:27:22,149 --> 01:27:46,329
to the camera? Can you see this? Okay. So this time we're going to hold on. Oh,

477
01:27:46,329 --> 01:28:02,869
that was wild. I can't. This, here we go. Ready? Hands up. I clicked it. I'm not touching

478
01:28:02,869 --> 01:28:12,970
anything. Oh, you can feel it. Feel it. Do you see that? Do you feel it? I'm like fucking

479
01:28:12,970 --> 01:28:28,949
melting. I can't do anything about this. Just fucking campaign. Who cares? Yep. This

480
01:28:28,949 --> 01:28:52,739
is the, I remember you can't control the plane. What happened? Oh, end. All right. Let's go.

481
01:28:54,699 --> 01:28:58,460
Leave your left hand on the keyboard. Okay. Is it, is it, is it going to sense it?

482
01:28:59,420 --> 01:29:16,939
You could hit the broad side of a bond. Why am I doing this? Repeat fucking emo face. That

483
01:29:16,939 --> 01:29:39,380
guy's making. Got it. No, no. Exit. Exit the game. Oh shit. Quickly. Hold on. No,

484
01:29:39,380 --> 01:30:06,140
this might be it. Oh, fuck. It's over. I can't. I'm the task manager is on the

485
01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:15,939
other monitor. Oh shit. I did it accidentally. Oh my fucking God.

486
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:59,720
That was a 3d game that I should never open ever again. What are you clicking on now?

487
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:14,819
I'm so upset that this is just the same fucking game. There's almost no differences. It's

488
01:31:14,819 --> 01:31:22,100
probably all DigiPen student games for a shell company. Honest to God though, why is this a

489
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:29,720
second version? I'm going to, okay, at some point here, I want to open up the screenshot that I took

490
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:37,079
of the last one and actually see if they just put two in front of the game and release it again.

491
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:58,090
Looks like we're going to, uh, atom ball, atom ball. What a joke. What an absolute joke.

492
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:08,140
700,000 games to nothing is the same games have the same problems. We just put a two in

493
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:17,689
front. That's it. I'd like to know what the two what it actually is. So we're going atom atom ball.

494
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:25,420
All right. Hold on to your, uh, hold on to your hats because here comes atom ball.

495
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:32,920
Where the hell is it? I actually don't even know where it is. Atom ball. Oh, okay. It's

496
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:45,449
down this one. This one. All right. Here we go. Good luck. I'm going to have to do a full

497
01:32:45,449 --> 01:32:59,109
clean install of windows after this. Let me just make sure it works. Same problems as last

498
01:32:59,109 --> 01:33:08,949
time. I'm just reliving the making of that last video. Does that one didn't open? What is the two

499
01:33:08,949 --> 01:33:22,340
for? What is the two for? You've misread. It's 700,000 games to meaning also means it's just

500
01:33:22,340 --> 01:33:27,140
again. Oh my God. This one doesn't open either. Adam. What's it called?

501
01:33:27,779 --> 01:33:35,289
Adam ball. Put an X on it. We also need to see if the same games didn't open

502
01:33:35,289 --> 01:33:42,279
because I thought some of them did. Holy shit. I can't even fucking believe this.

503
01:33:46,310 --> 01:33:57,819
Well, let's see what else there is to try and attempt. What's the original 700,000 games like?

504
01:33:58,460 --> 01:34:08,760
It's this. It's this. It's the same thing. I think I think we may have actually been baited

505
01:34:09,479 --> 01:34:23,060
on me making the video again. That's what happened. So it looks like we're doing, uh,

506
01:34:23,939 --> 01:34:33,020
the ancient Mayan empire. All those are the same exact game. All right. Just in case anyone's

507
01:34:33,020 --> 01:34:43,420
wondering, there's no difference in those games. There's no differences. They are all the same

508
01:34:43,420 --> 01:34:49,859
game. So we, I can just delete all of these. Oh my God. This is going to take 20,000 hours.

509
01:34:50,420 --> 01:35:03,210
Secret empires of Maya open it. Holy shit. This actually takes up the whole screen.

510
01:35:04,859 --> 01:35:16,420
What a miracle. That's an actual miracle. Is this the first? This is the first one that's actually

511
01:35:16,420 --> 01:35:30,520
1920 by 1080. Why is this all off? Okay. Hey, remember that video? Ow, my ears.

512
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:56,659
Hey, what's this one? Let's try this one. Now I know why they had it all turned down.

513
01:35:58,420 --> 01:36:06,899
Uh, secret empire of the ancient world. Inca. Good. All right. What are we looking for?

514
01:36:06,899 --> 01:36:14,500
Looking for chain crowbar, sunglasses, domino tires, seagull, seagull, Russian doll, maps,

515
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:35,399
sapphire, sapphires. Got it. Oh my God. Why? It just reset. It's the same. There's no difference.

516
01:36:35,399 --> 01:36:40,600
It's the same background. It's just a desktop background with a bunch of random blurry bitmap

517
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:44,199
images. This is the same thing as it was before. There's not one single difference.

518
01:36:44,199 --> 01:36:58,550
We're looking for brooch, wheel, belt, oil can, skull, scrub brush, owl, lunchbox.

519
01:36:59,510 --> 01:37:19,430
That's not, that's not correct. Good work. You found one. Lunchbox. What is this? A piece

520
01:37:19,430 --> 01:37:32,699
of bread? All right. I got that one. I only need the owl and that's it. Where's the owl?

521
01:37:32,699 --> 01:37:41,750
Find it. Found it. I did it. Done. Oh no, I didn't. Brooch, wheel, and belt. Wheel,

522
01:37:42,630 --> 01:37:47,460
with sunglasses. Why are you clicking on the sun? There's the brooch.

523
01:37:48,100 --> 01:37:53,460
And then we need a belt. There's the belt. Congratulations. You have won the game. Thank

524
01:37:53,460 --> 01:38:15,770
you for playing. What the fuck? Why is there a piece of bread on the goat's ass?

525
01:38:16,569 --> 01:38:28,659
All right. Help me out here. Let's speed run this. Everybody clicked right here.

526
01:38:29,619 --> 01:38:36,329
There's no goat. The goat's not here. Thank you. No, it's a cat again. The same like 10 people

527
01:38:36,329 --> 01:38:54,619
clicked on the cat. Okay, that looks good. Are you guys even trying? Somebody is. Come on,

528
01:38:54,619 --> 01:39:11,579
we need to get to the third level. We need to find the brush. Where's the, where's the

529
01:39:11,579 --> 01:39:17,989
toothbrush? Whatever kind of brush that is. Found it. Congratulations. You've done it.

530
01:39:18,710 --> 01:39:34,439
All right, here's it. I gotta, listen. If you guys can get all nine of these

531
01:39:35,319 --> 01:39:49,270
in nine separate circles, you win. Can you do it? You guys will win. Collectively Chat

532
01:39:49,270 --> 01:39:54,729
will win the prize. And the prize is you get to see my face on the face cam and I'll wink.

533
01:39:55,449 --> 01:40:11,979
What a great prize that is. Okay, we got mouse. One, two,

534
01:40:12,619 --> 01:40:40,460
three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. There's no crow on this list.

535
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:59,180
You guys are so close. What's that? That's not even anything either. You guys got that wrong

536
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:14,899
too. Two. Holy shit, you guys got a lot wrong. Wow. Oh no, that is right. That's correct.

537
01:41:14,899 --> 01:41:22,680
Oh, that's correct too. Yeah, you guys didn't, you guys didn't get it. Sorry.

538
01:41:23,479 --> 01:41:37,220
You wanna try it one more time? Think you have what it takes? I'll give you minutes to look.

539
01:41:45,739 --> 01:41:52,140
Okay. I want one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight circles. And they only need

540
01:41:52,140 --> 01:41:59,739
to be on the right thing. And I'm gonna wink at you. Think how cool that reaction gift would

541
01:41:59,739 --> 01:42:03,020
be. You know, like you're talking to somebody on Twitter and it's like, oh yeah, like that's

542
01:42:03,020 --> 01:42:52,920
sure. That's definitely my favorite game. I just did it. Get a minute here. Imagine the audacity

543
01:42:52,920 --> 01:43:00,859
that you would have to put these four in a row on each other. To release it twice.

544
01:43:03,689 --> 01:43:11,909
Secret Empires, Secret Empires, Aztec, Inca, Maya, and you click the send to Amazon

545
01:43:11,909 --> 01:43:28,039
purchasing button. Balls. It's actually almost like, that's like almost commendable at that point.

546
01:43:28,039 --> 01:43:38,539
Okay, here we go. I want nine circles. And if you guys, nine circles, I'll give you a sneeze.

547
01:43:39,180 --> 01:44:18,550
You can get it. It's coming. Did you get it? Let's try. Oh, I wanted to come up so bad.

548
01:44:19,270 --> 01:44:31,770
Did you get it? Let's see. All right, we got one, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

549
01:44:31,770 --> 01:45:12,020
Who fucking did this? It's a wasp. That's why. Let's see if you got it. You didn't say they had

550
01:45:12,020 --> 01:45:22,949
to be correct. What did you think I meant? Just put nine circles? Oh, we have to beat this

551
01:45:22,949 --> 01:45:40,250
one. Did this last time. Goldfish. I'm gonna give you guys one last chance to get a sneeze.

552
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:49,609
I actually don't know where they are. I actually don't know where the fuck they are.

553
01:45:50,649 --> 01:45:59,579
All right, let's see what happens. Let's see what happens first. Can you guys find the remaining

554
01:46:00,899 --> 01:46:05,270
four? No, no, no, no, no, not yet. Not yet. We're gonna do this for next time.

555
01:46:05,270 --> 01:46:23,670
We're gonna have a contest. There's the pipe. Find it. Good work. Where's the moon?

556
01:46:23,670 --> 01:46:38,789
Find it. Where's the moon? That's a cat. Oh, I could have just looked at that. Where's the

557
01:46:38,789 --> 01:46:48,220
moon? Holy shit, that was hidden. All right, you guys ready? The next, the goal here for you

558
01:46:48,220 --> 01:46:58,310
guys is can you find all of these? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight before I

559
01:46:58,310 --> 01:47:39,770
get to negative 100,000 points. Ready? Go. My hand, my hand is fucking killing me. What did

560
01:47:39,770 --> 01:48:10,279
I get to? All right, when I get to negative 10,000 points for that, I clicked it. All right,

561
01:48:10,279 --> 01:48:16,869
did you do it? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. You didn't do it.

562
01:48:18,279 --> 01:48:27,539
Bird. Mouse. What have you guys done? It's not even correct. Candles.

563
01:48:29,380 --> 01:48:32,180
Circle. I don't know if that was, but I already clicked it.

564
01:48:33,689 --> 01:48:41,979
Uh, hook. Water jug. You missed. Uh, I don't know if these are heart and I don't know what that is.

565
01:48:41,979 --> 01:49:02,329
You missed them. Sorry. I win. Yeah, that's not it. That's not correct. All right,

566
01:49:02,329 --> 01:49:13,819
if I can find it before you guys, I win. Ready? Go. Got it. I fucking lose.

567
01:49:14,539 --> 01:49:28,409
All right, that was fun. We're out. This is seriously just dump whatever is in grandma's

568
01:49:28,409 --> 01:49:35,779
closet after she's owned the house for a hundred years into the living room and figure out what

569
01:49:35,779 --> 01:49:41,220
you're going to sell and what you're going to, who's going to take what. Well, you know,

570
01:49:41,220 --> 01:49:45,859
like that, like the four kids, who the fuck is taking the penguin statue? What are we going

571
01:49:45,859 --> 01:50:19,529
to do with that? That's enough of that. I'm not going to click the other one. You already

572
01:50:19,529 --> 01:50:26,390
know what it is. Is this again? It's literally the exact same game. They just put a two on

573
01:50:27,109 --> 01:50:35,270
it. Uh, this game has one review on Amazon. It is a one star review. The person just wrote,

574
01:50:35,270 --> 01:50:42,789
I can't get it to work. That's the only review on the entire website. So got baited pretty hard

575
01:50:42,789 --> 01:50:51,289
here, but you know, you got to commit. All right. Uh, what are you, where are we going now?

576
01:50:59,779 --> 01:51:13,539
No, really? Why do you guys want to do that of all the things to do? Oh my God.

577
01:51:14,100 --> 01:51:25,579
Somebody just gave a lot of money. Hold on while we sit here for a moment. Uh, thank you to just

578
01:51:25,579 --> 01:51:38,329
that guy for the $70, $60 right now. And then $10 a few minutes ago. Holy shit, man. Thank you

579
01:51:38,329 --> 01:51:50,220
for the 70 fucking dollars. Thank you. You say, Jeremy, you legendary shit poster. Of course

580
01:51:50,220 --> 01:51:53,819
you would do this again, but I would recommend if you really want the chat to make bad

581
01:51:53,819 --> 01:52:00,380
decisions, you should send them to cool math games. We tried that before and it was a

582
01:52:00,380 --> 01:52:09,449
disaster. And then you say, try the worst game here and make the chat pay for you to change it.

583
01:52:09,449 --> 01:52:19,109
That's so terrible. Why would I want to do that? Make, make you pay. Um, if I just,

584
01:52:19,109 --> 01:52:24,329
okay, first of all, thank you for the $70, but let's go over this for a second here.

585
01:52:24,329 --> 01:52:32,699
If I sat here like this, right? If I'm sitting here like this and I say, okay guys,

586
01:52:32,859 --> 01:52:40,140
uh, sorry, but, um, for us to play, uh, another game, you're going to have to give me 50 bucks.

587
01:52:41,579 --> 01:52:50,039
You just leave. You'd be like, okay, X, I got some laundry. I could probably fucking do.

588
01:52:50,039 --> 01:52:53,239
I would just sit here and watch the view count drop at like four or 5,000.

589
01:52:53,800 --> 01:53:03,670
Some of you guys would stay just to see like what would happen, but you just leave. I don't

590
01:53:03,670 --> 01:53:09,859
know if I don't know. That's a good idea. What the oh. All right. So we're going, uh,

591
01:53:16,939 --> 01:53:29,180
I can't fucking believe I'm pressing this button, but I am. I just have to press it, right?

592
01:53:31,539 --> 01:53:38,420
Oh my God. The, the, the ball of koala, thanks to the $50.

593
01:53:39,859 --> 01:53:44,789
All right, here you go. So that means I have to get off of this.

594
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:51,340
He, he's get $50 to get off of this one. It actually worked.

595
01:53:52,279 --> 01:53:58,680
No, no, you can't pay. You can't pay. What's going on with the camera? You can't, you can't pay

596
01:53:58,680 --> 01:54:03,560
money to influence what I do on this stream. You understand? If you want to give money,

597
01:54:04,119 --> 01:54:09,880
thanks, but I can't put that as a precedent because we've got super frog two to play

598
01:54:12,659 --> 01:54:23,979
everybody X out of the window. No, stay, stay here. Click on your favorite fucking toy.

599
01:54:27,140 --> 01:54:29,380
Click your favorite toy on here and I'll be able to judge you guys.

600
01:54:34,220 --> 01:54:43,640
Fox. Cool. That's pretty cool toy. Forget about what, uh, the, the onk. That's the onk, right?

601
01:54:44,199 --> 01:54:53,079
Okay. Cool. Uh, bottle of wine. That's pretty nice. Gekko. Nice little pet. Uh, bird crow.

602
01:54:54,630 --> 01:55:02,739
There's a monkey of some sort skull. And I'm surprised no one has clicked on the

603
01:55:02,739 --> 01:55:06,840
cockroach or the spider or the snail. I would have clicked on the snail

604
01:55:11,539 --> 01:55:21,020
or the turtle or the sun. Nice work guys. That's it. That's the end of that one.

605
01:55:21,020 --> 01:55:24,699
So now let's actually get the next one going here because that one was banned,

606
01:55:24,699 --> 01:55:41,380
but I got paid $50 to do it. What's next? Do I have, do I have time to eat like a

607
01:55:41,380 --> 01:55:48,949
bowl of spaghetti? I'm going to eat a bowl of spaghetti really fast. Okay. No.

608
01:55:51,529 --> 01:56:03,859
What's this one? The gorge. What is it? I can't see it. This is, I can't see what this

609
01:56:03,859 --> 01:56:16,899
is. Baby bird care. Sure. Let's try it. Social eating. No, I'm going to eat it as fast as I can

610
01:56:16,899 --> 01:56:24,659
downstairs and like get indigestion. Okay. Here we go. Baby bird care is opening and it's

611
01:56:24,659 --> 01:56:32,600
already having a problem here. I'm not going to switch until I'm certain. Hmm. Maybe. Okay.

612
01:56:33,560 --> 01:56:49,800
It did open. I don't know if you can see this, but here we go. Wait a minute. Hold on.

613
01:56:55,079 --> 01:57:22,550
Is this Diablo 2? Honest to God. 800 by 600 and 640 by 480. What an excellent fucking game.

614
01:57:22,550 --> 01:57:26,630
All right. Here we go. Baby bird care for the baby bird. Change player. Welcome bird.

615
01:57:27,430 --> 01:57:32,500
He thinks I'm a bird. Okay. That's interesting. Help. Wait for a visitor.

616
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:36,659
Drag a baby bird to an empty nest. Release the baby bird to set it down.

617
01:57:36,659 --> 01:57:45,260
Wait for a visitor. The baby bird wants to sleep. Click on it to sing a song. The baby bird will

618
01:57:45,260 --> 01:57:51,420
fall asleep. The baby bird awakens. The baby bird wants its parent. Click on it and take the baby

619
01:57:51,420 --> 01:57:57,960
bird to its parent. The babies have wishes to eat, to drink, to play. To fulfill a wish,

620
01:57:57,960 --> 01:58:04,489
you should take food from table, water, ball, pickup item and take it to the baby bird.

621
01:58:05,449 --> 01:58:11,979
There's a kitchen. To prepare food, click on the kitchen to place an order and a bird in a nest.

622
01:58:12,699 --> 01:58:17,210
The hummingbirds will prepare the food and place it on the table. They have tables.

623
01:58:17,850 --> 01:58:26,220
To place more orders, click on the kitchen several times. Prepare a drink. Musical instrument.

624
01:58:26,859 --> 01:58:31,640
Drop items you don't need in it. You can use a musical instrument to put all the babies to

625
01:58:31,640 --> 01:58:38,310
sleep. And there are bonuses. Mood. Cook. This is the most elaborate one so far.

626
01:58:39,270 --> 01:58:50,659
2007. We're gonna go on medium level 1-1. No, tutorial. Medium tutorial. I need to know

627
01:58:50,659 --> 01:58:55,779
what I'm going on. This is first day working in... Today will be my first day working in

628
01:58:55,779 --> 01:59:00,180
the kindergarten. If I don't do well, I'll be mopping floors the rest of my life.

629
01:59:00,180 --> 01:59:09,930
So I better listen to my boss. Fuck. Ding dong. This is the first visitor drag a baby

630
01:59:09,930 --> 01:59:23,899
bird to an empty nest. Wait for the baby bird's wish to appear. It's a food wish.

631
01:59:23,899 --> 01:59:30,699
You need to arrange some food. Click on the kitchen to place an order. Right. The hummingbirds

632
01:59:30,699 --> 01:59:41,479
are preparing food now. This is just Diner Dash. But with a Warcraft 3 custom map. Okay,

633
01:59:41,479 --> 01:59:49,350
it's ready. Click on the table to pick it up. Take the food of the baby. Give it some time

634
01:59:49,350 --> 02:00:02,810
to eat. Perfect music to do this one. Remember this thing? Remember from Banjo Kazooie? Hold

635
02:00:02,810 --> 02:00:22,250
on. Remember that one? Takes time to sing a baby to fall asleep. I'm done with this one.

636
02:00:25,029 --> 02:00:34,460
My fucking ears. Oh, wait. It's a bird daycare. The happier the bird are, the more points you

637
02:00:34,460 --> 02:00:38,460
earn. Now you're ready for your next visitor. All right. Give me the hardest level in the

638
02:00:38,460 --> 02:00:45,239
game. Place two orders in the kitchen. There's a... Well, I don't know where the

639
02:00:45,239 --> 02:00:52,659
doorbell is here, but that's fine. Wait for the wishes to appear.

640
02:00:53,380 --> 02:01:37,619
Let's fucking go. Eat. Come on. Already got you. Thrash. Are you hungry again? Food? Sleep?

641
02:01:37,619 --> 02:01:49,909
Same? It was so easy. I was right there. Ready to go. Give it up. Good. Where's the...

642
02:01:49,909 --> 02:02:09,930
How do I buy things? Food? Got it. We got two now. Ooh, getting tricky. This is getting

643
02:02:09,930 --> 02:02:13,989
tricky for me. I can't wait to eat that spaghetti. Look, that looks like spaghetti

644
02:02:13,989 --> 02:02:17,350
to me. That looks like, well, looks like somebody chewed up a bunch of spaghetti and

645
02:02:17,350 --> 02:02:22,500
then spit it all out. But it still looks like spaghetti. You know what I'm saying?

646
02:02:24,180 --> 02:02:41,539
Hurry up. Somebody just wrote, why are people not leaving? Why are people not leaving? I mean,

647
02:02:41,539 --> 02:02:52,659
that is a question. Is it a good question? I don't know. Because people want to see all

648
02:02:53,220 --> 02:03:18,920
700,000 of them. I got a silver extra level. That's fun. 700,000 games remastered. All right,

649
02:03:18,920 --> 02:03:29,590
where the hell was that? There's so much more. What happened? Did everybody just change their

650
02:03:29,590 --> 02:03:42,859
mind immediately? Motorbike. I will never give up. Motorbike. I will never give up.

651
02:03:43,739 --> 02:03:51,350
It's going to get interesting here. Let me get a bowl of spaghetti. No, not yet. Chess.

652
02:03:51,350 --> 02:04:10,180
Do you really? Can this be the one that just gets an X? Can you guys vote for the one that

653
02:04:10,180 --> 02:04:23,739
gets the X? Because chess. Okay, now there's a reason to leave if I open up chess. Who the

654
02:04:23,739 --> 02:04:32,890
fuck wants to see chess? Apparently half of the people in this chat. You want a rematch?

655
02:04:33,770 --> 02:04:43,430
Fine. You get your rematch. We're doing this one time. Well, that's all over the place. Well,

656
02:04:43,510 --> 02:05:09,770
okay. Did I even get to? All right, whatever. It's going to just sit like that.

657
02:05:10,729 --> 02:05:12,489
Got to get this off the screen. Here's your rematch.

658
02:05:20,619 --> 02:05:24,859
Okay, so I'm going to, I don't even know what, who am I playing? Are we players?

659
02:05:31,579 --> 02:06:01,340
Oh, whoops. Okay. Setup. Control. File. Okay. No, no, no. All right, all right, all right.

660
02:06:01,340 --> 02:06:07,670
Hold on. Let's make this better. Yeah, we already did this and I destroyed chat. It was

661
02:06:07,670 --> 02:06:24,329
actually really embarrassing. Okay. Here. This is going to take forever.

662
02:06:29,130 --> 02:06:40,069
This guy is selected. Now where? We already did this. All right. Good move. My turn.

663
02:06:40,069 --> 02:07:01,369
Do I have to like clock out or something? Oh, what the hell just happened? It's making

664
02:07:01,369 --> 02:07:46,649
it smaller. What? God. That's not happening. That's not happening. Sorry. I surrender. You

665
02:07:46,649 --> 02:08:11,930
win. I surrender. Mystery, mystery museum. No, hold on. This looks kind of split between

666
02:08:11,930 --> 02:08:20,310
mini golf mania and mystery museum. This is a great stream to trim. I'm not going to read

667
02:08:20,310 --> 02:08:32,569
the rest of that. Now, mystery museum. I just saw it. I think mystery museum is going to

668
02:08:32,569 --> 02:08:41,590
win. People are still clicking on. No, this is another chess game. No, that's not chess.

669
02:08:41,590 --> 02:08:51,079
That's checkers. Yeah, I saw it. It was mystery museum. All right, let's open it.

670
02:08:59,779 --> 02:09:06,329
Mystery museum. Thank you for voting. Let us click on your face. Okay. A little bit later.

671
02:09:06,329 --> 02:09:10,899
Not right now. All right. What's your runner? This that this actually opens.

672
02:09:12,520 --> 02:09:46,699
It did. Wow. Holy shit. That was so painless. Oh, he is just all hidden object games.

673
02:09:46,699 --> 02:10:04,899
That's when you see it. I need to know if okay, if they're all all of them are

674
02:10:04,899 --> 02:10:09,380
fucking hidden object games. I remember this. Watch this. This is the one right next to it.

675
02:10:09,380 --> 02:10:14,659
This is haunted house. Yeah. Oh, scary. It's the same thing with like a mummy this time.

676
02:10:14,659 --> 02:10:27,109
A really small mummy. A mummy that is not even like three feet tall. That's scary.

677
02:10:35,380 --> 02:10:39,539
It sure is. All right. Let's just get this over with. This is the next one. It's cryptic

678
02:10:39,539 --> 02:10:57,159
castle. Oh, I wonder what it's going to be. Yes. Oh, okay. Cool. There's like 15 hidden

679
02:10:57,159 --> 02:11:04,180
object games in the same. Look at that badass up there. Surfing on a broom.

680
02:11:08,869 --> 02:11:18,220
That's a T pose. Surfing on a broomstick. Witch. And it was what we needed to click on.

681
02:11:18,779 --> 02:11:32,619
That's all I needed to see. That was cryptic castle. This is ghostly garden. It's the

682
02:11:32,619 --> 02:11:37,659
same fucking game. There's no difference. In fact, there's the tiny mummy again.

683
02:11:38,619 --> 02:11:48,039
Same music too. See, I wasn't bullshitting. Those of you guys that watched the video on

684
02:11:48,039 --> 02:12:06,119
the first 700,000. This is the second, part two, second game. I wasn't lying. It's the

685
02:12:06,119 --> 02:12:15,779
witch again. Is it weird that I want that as an emote? Is that illegal? It might be illegal,

686
02:12:15,779 --> 02:12:30,630
but I want this. It's probably, honestly, this whole game is probably ripped off from

687
02:12:30,789 --> 02:12:38,869
Google images anyways. I wonder if I can find this image. Some of you guys that use the internet,

688
02:12:38,869 --> 02:12:42,869
that know exactly what the fuck you're doing. See if you can track this down,

689
02:12:42,869 --> 02:12:55,510
see where it's actually from. Okay. So that was, I can't, I cannot believe it's the same

690
02:12:55,510 --> 02:13:19,539
fucking game. That's unfucking believable. Selling a sequel. There's no sequel. Did

691
02:13:19,539 --> 02:13:36,949
somebody already find it? You did not. That's not it. That's not the right one.

692
02:13:39,319 --> 02:13:47,909
I'm not, I'm not clicking until I'm certain, because these are going to be gnomes.

693
02:13:51,930 --> 02:14:02,039
Crazy witch surfing on her broomstick. I'm not clicking on a gnome and I'm not

694
02:14:02,039 --> 02:14:09,859
clicking on porn. All right. Can one of the mods, let me know if any of these are real

695
02:14:09,859 --> 02:14:15,539
before I gnome myself on stream for like the 30th time. By the way, where are we going?

696
02:14:15,539 --> 02:14:42,619
What happened? Checkers. 700,000 games too. I'll never, I can't get over this.

697
02:14:51,380 --> 02:15:02,010
You want to play checkers? All right. It looks like we're playing checkers,

698
02:15:02,010 --> 02:15:17,590
but no, I don't even, why do I want to play checkers? Checkers? Don't worry. Don't worry.

699
02:15:17,590 --> 02:15:30,550
Everyone that's concerned about checkers, it don't even open. It doesn't even open.

700
02:15:30,550 --> 02:15:39,750
No, it don't open. So scratch that off the list. 3D checkers doesn't open. Sorry,

701
02:15:39,750 --> 02:15:53,500
I know everyone's really disappointed. Liar. I'm not a liar. That, I can't open it.

702
02:15:53,500 --> 02:16:08,060
Just restart your computer and try again. Oh my god. It works on my PC. You don't own that

703
02:16:08,060 --> 02:16:14,979
game. Nobody does. Me and the one guy that bought the game that gave it a one-star rating

704
02:16:14,979 --> 02:16:23,510
own this game. All right. Looks like we're going to mania. Golf mania, which is down here.

705
02:16:26,260 --> 02:16:38,899
Mini golf mania 3D. Will you open? So interesting enough, all the games,

706
02:16:38,899 --> 02:16:42,260
look, we'll do this in real time. Any game that has the word 3D in it.

707
02:16:45,180 --> 02:17:08,549
You ready? Here we are. If it has 3D in the title, it does not open. I wonder why that is.

708
02:17:11,190 --> 02:17:17,530
Hmm. Interesting. Update your graphics card.

709
02:17:20,620 --> 02:17:30,120
You clicked on an image. Yeah, I gotta, I'm sorry guys. It's, but I gotta update my graphics card.

710
02:17:30,120 --> 02:17:40,709
Go again, try again. The same issues from the last one. No, I can't click that one. Do it

711
02:17:40,709 --> 02:17:53,209
again. It does, I, that one doesn't work. No, no, the one, this, okay, fine. Back game in 3D.

712
02:17:53,850 --> 02:18:21,540
What do you know? Hey, look backgammon 3D. You see? Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Which has been found?

713
02:18:21,540 --> 02:18:34,569
Is my computer lagging? I don't even know how to play backgammon. No, wait, wait, wait. You

714
02:18:34,569 --> 02:19:03,959
found the image. No fucking way. Oh, unbelievable. I can't fucking believe you found it. Hold on.

715
02:19:10,659 --> 02:19:14,200
How did you find this that quickly?

716
02:19:26,739 --> 02:19:46,200
Unbelievable. But where did that come from? And did they have permission to put it in their game?

717
02:19:50,040 --> 02:20:10,700
No way. Guaranteed no. Guaranteed no. Is it the right witch? Hold on. That, who,

718
02:20:10,780 --> 02:20:20,360
nobody plays backgammon. No one. Who cares about backgammon? It doesn't make any sense.

719
02:20:22,340 --> 02:20:40,420
Bye. See you later. All right. Let's, and this is very important, actually. Let's see.

720
02:20:41,379 --> 02:20:44,659
Okay. For a second, I was like freaking out. Yeah. I saved it to the desktop.

721
02:20:44,659 --> 02:20:58,309
So there it is. This file is 27 kilobytes. All right. Hold on. Hold on. This is important.

722
02:20:58,950 --> 02:21:05,030
I need to open up this way. We need to see if it's the right witch.

723
02:21:05,030 --> 02:21:08,809
That's actually pretty important. That is the right witch. I don't even know why we're doing

724
02:21:08,809 --> 02:21:12,969
this. You know how much time, there's so much that we still have to go through.

725
02:21:12,969 --> 02:21:38,120
And I'm doing this shit right now. She's not here. We have to beat this level. Edit the

726
02:21:38,120 --> 02:22:04,889
snort over her face. Why is that so funny? I got to get rid of the white.

727
02:22:27,719 --> 02:22:38,040
Where's the witch? So we can compare the image. I don't see the witch anywhere.

728
02:22:38,040 --> 02:22:50,819
I just need to like, just skip everything. It's the castle game. Wrong game. Middle left of

729
02:22:50,819 --> 02:22:57,610
screen. I don't see the witch anywhere. What are you talking about? It's there at all. It's

730
02:22:57,610 --> 02:23:03,370
not, guys, everyone that's saying that I'm an idiot. You have to remember these are all the

731
02:23:03,370 --> 02:23:09,049
same fucking video game. The assets are the same across the entire five game catalog.

732
02:23:10,010 --> 02:23:25,850
Just scorpion. Where's this? We're just gonna get to the next level. Scorpion found the bread.

733
02:23:27,290 --> 02:23:32,569
One more. Crossbones and scorpion. Scorpion. Crossbones. Got it. Okay, here we go.

734
02:24:02,569 --> 02:24:16,440
Is it? It's not the same image. This is not the same image. That's impossible. I don't

735
02:24:16,440 --> 02:24:51,770
believe it. No fucking way. It's a different. It's a different witch. Another one. No fucking

736
02:24:51,850 --> 02:25:08,569
way. I refuse to believe there's another one. There's no way. Oh my god. There's another one.

737
02:25:10,340 --> 02:25:19,340
Oh my god. But it's not the right one. That's not correct. Guys, that's not correct.

738
02:25:21,319 --> 02:25:35,940
It's not the right one. Look, it's not correct. You gotta be fucking kidding me.

739
02:25:37,420 --> 02:25:59,420
Hold on a second. Are you guys ready for this shit? It's a different witch.

740
02:26:08,709 --> 02:26:12,250
I need to flip. We need to transform it. It's not the same.

741
02:26:22,729 --> 02:26:41,620
We need to get it out there. Exactly. I need to transform it. Oh, get this out of the way.

742
02:26:42,260 --> 02:26:55,450
Is it the same image? How do I rotate this? How can these be different images though?

743
02:26:55,450 --> 02:27:03,260
That's the thing I don't fucking understand. It has edits on it so they didn't get fucking sued.

744
02:27:05,610 --> 02:27:11,909
Is this the same person? I can't. I don't know if this is even the same. The broom is

745
02:27:11,909 --> 02:27:35,930
a different direction. It's been photoshopped and it's blurry. Hold on. I need to fucking

746
02:27:35,930 --> 02:28:22,579
fix this. No, I can't. I can't do it. The hat is different. It's so fucking pixelated

747
02:28:22,579 --> 02:28:38,420
it's almost impossible to tell. But look at the hat though. I think they just like smeared it

748
02:28:38,420 --> 02:28:51,000
in Photoshop. It's a mix of the two images. Did her mouth just move?

749
02:28:52,440 --> 02:29:03,559
The one on the right's mouth just moved. What the fuck? I'm scared by itself.

750
02:29:04,360 --> 02:29:15,700
Okay, I need to get out of this. Turn these off. That's actually unfucking believable though.

751
02:29:19,459 --> 02:29:32,579
My god. Wait a minute. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. No, don't do this to me. No,

752
02:29:32,579 --> 02:30:24,280
don't do this to me. Somebody just cropped this from this stream. It's a screenshot of

753
02:30:24,280 --> 02:30:43,100
this stream. Where the fuck are we going? We are a fucking ton of money came in. Hold on a

754
02:30:43,100 --> 02:30:59,719
second. Frillity. Frillity. Thanks for the $50. I love this witch game. I don't know how

755
02:30:59,719 --> 02:31:05,350
you guys found that that quickly. Was it as easy as just... Wait, no. Okay, hold on.

756
02:31:05,350 --> 02:31:09,350
Thank you so much for the $50. It's time for slime. Thank you for the $50.

757
02:31:11,180 --> 02:31:15,909
There's another image here. At this point, I don't know which one is fake and which one

758
02:31:15,909 --> 02:31:26,979
is real. Thank you for the $50. It's time for slime and for litty and just that guy gave

759
02:31:26,979 --> 02:31:39,219
$40, $50 on top of like $100 plus $130, $140. Jesus Christ. That's an absolute insane amount

760
02:31:39,219 --> 02:31:44,489
of money. Thank you guys. How do I vote? Just click the screen. This is how you vote.

761
02:31:46,469 --> 02:31:55,110
Yeah, that was fun. Thank you. Thank you so much. Oh, look what we got here. Right.

762
02:31:55,110 --> 02:32:03,239
Probably should take that off. All right. Thank you for the dick that was on the screen.

763
02:32:03,239 --> 02:32:09,370
That's very, very appropriate. So what was that? I don't remember where we even were.

764
02:32:14,149 --> 02:32:18,899
I don't know what that was. What was that? What's the last thing we did?

765
02:32:19,620 --> 02:32:26,340
It was back in 3D. Okay. So are you guys going to behave? Can I turn it back on?

766
02:32:27,059 --> 02:32:44,229
Please. There's another one. I can't tell if this is... I mean, there's another one.

767
02:32:44,229 --> 02:32:53,719
There's another witch image here. There's another one? This is crazy. Hold on. Let me

768
02:32:53,719 --> 02:33:01,079
just like show this on stream for a second. This is like kind of wild here. You know what

769
02:33:01,079 --> 02:33:07,930
I'm saying? Hold on. You guys are still finding these images. It's actually pretty...

770
02:33:08,489 --> 02:33:15,239
This one is pretty shocking. That's kind of ridiculous. I mean, there's so many of these.

771
02:33:15,239 --> 02:33:30,389
Wow. Where did you find that one? There's so many. Is there some website? Is there

772
02:33:30,389 --> 02:33:34,309
gotta be some website that you're going to to be able to create these, to see these?

773
02:33:36,170 --> 02:33:39,850
Witch on broom with scary face. That's the number one result.

774
02:33:44,360 --> 02:34:00,840
Interesting. All right. What are we playing? Amph... Amphric, thanks for the five community subs.

775
02:34:02,020 --> 02:34:05,139
You tried to make another deck and you failed. I don't even know where you guys are going with

776
02:34:05,139 --> 02:34:10,260
this. So I'm going to pick one that's in the middle. I see air ball and mystic demon

777
02:34:10,260 --> 02:34:16,340
between the two nuts is the shaft of the penis. And I'm going to pick one that's in

778
02:34:16,340 --> 02:34:20,389
there because the, you know, you've read what you sell. So we're going to go with,

779
02:34:22,969 --> 02:34:32,200
uh, we're going to go with air ball, air ball. Here we go. Thanks for voting.

780
02:34:32,200 --> 02:34:51,020
Let's see if this one works. It does. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Maybe it doesn't. No,

781
02:34:51,020 --> 02:35:29,110
it does. What is, what is this on the screen? Oh, it's because I can't even turn it off.

782
02:35:29,110 --> 02:35:47,879
I can't even get out of this. All right. Get off. It's because this capture is all

783
02:35:47,879 --> 02:35:56,069
fucked up. Oh my goodness. Reset it. There we go. Okay. Okay. I'm ready.

784
02:35:57,700 --> 02:36:04,809
Why did the music just drastically fucking change? Oh, the music is so bad and loud.

785
02:36:05,770 --> 02:36:22,950
What happened? I'm not even going to attempt to fix the,

786
02:36:24,219 --> 02:36:27,180
I'm not going to even attempt to fix the fucking screen here. I can't even leave the

787
02:36:27,180 --> 02:36:34,739
window. Look at what does that do? Okay. Logan, log in, new game, save game, new game.

788
02:36:34,739 --> 02:36:44,020
Choose your pad. Whoa. One, one. That's my desktop background and it's just a mirror.

789
02:36:44,899 --> 02:36:52,360
How lazy do you have to be? That's the ultimate in laziness. You just mirrored one image to make a

790
02:36:52,360 --> 02:37:03,819
giant screen. Why wouldn't you just get a picture that was big enough to fit? Why? What am I,

791
02:37:03,819 --> 02:37:21,260
I'm a penguin? No, I'm not the penguin. Oh, it's just brick breaker. This one's really fun

792
02:37:21,260 --> 02:37:47,399
actually. Oops. Sorry. It's kind of hard to control though. Ah, I thought I could make it.

793
02:37:48,899 --> 02:38:08,260
Oh, somebody here thought that was funny. I can't even hear anything.

794
02:38:10,899 --> 02:38:18,819
There we go. Kill the penguin. I'm about to. The penguin's about to be dead.

795
02:38:19,620 --> 02:38:34,340
Gotta maximize the shot. Beautiful. What? It's not a real penguin, guys. It's a digital,

796
02:38:34,340 --> 02:38:42,540
it's a digital copy. Well, that's a perfect copy. It's not a real penguin.

797
02:38:43,100 --> 02:38:59,000
This is just, in bowling, this is the worst thing you can possibly do.

798
02:39:10,760 --> 02:39:14,120
Excellent. Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it. I'm the bat.

799
02:39:14,760 --> 02:39:37,989
That one's fucking dumb. It was fun though. It was okay. So that brings us to where, where

800
02:39:37,989 --> 02:39:58,229
the heck was that? Air ball. It was just holding you back. Yeah, I agree. Oh, I'm

801
02:39:58,229 --> 02:40:05,399
gonna get spaghetti. All right, we're almost at the three hour mark and we're, we're, you

802
02:40:05,399 --> 02:40:12,420
know, we're almost like 30% to 40% of the way there. So I'm gonna just, I'm gonna eat

803
02:40:12,420 --> 02:40:19,700
spaghetti. I'll be back in probably 45. I'm just kidding. Motorbike Racing is the one.

804
02:40:21,020 --> 02:40:31,190
Motorbike Racing. Is it the one? Yeah, it looks like it. Extreme Motorbike Racing.

805
02:40:37,180 --> 02:40:41,979
I think this one was also in, all of them were. I'm just, I'm watching one of my

806
02:40:41,979 --> 02:40:48,100
favorite movies that I haven't seen in a long time. That's what's happening right now.

807
02:40:49,899 --> 02:40:57,420
Extreme Motorbike Racing, prepare for the crash. That's inevitable. Let's see what happens.

808
02:41:08,040 --> 02:41:09,799
I can't tell you, I don't know how loud this is.

809
02:41:16,790 --> 02:41:29,110
We're good. Can you see it? By the way, I just came to this realization. Turn the music off.

810
02:41:34,860 --> 02:41:57,739
You just contendo, Nintendo, contendo. Okay. Can you guys, I don't even know if you guys can see.

811
02:41:58,540 --> 02:42:05,159
I have no idea. Every other monitor is black. This is apparently 1920 by 1080.

812
02:42:07,239 --> 02:42:20,579
Okay. I don't think I agree. Okay, here we go. Start game. Yes, I remember this one. Race

813
02:42:20,579 --> 02:42:28,979
two. Race three. Fruising. No entrance fee. Race three. Yeah, I remember this one. This one sucks.

814
02:42:30,260 --> 02:42:43,899
Automatic transmission. Let's go. Holy shit. It is, it is 1920 by 1080.

815
02:42:44,540 --> 02:42:48,709
Yeah, this is one where I just drove into the wall. What? That's my favorite movie.

816
02:42:49,270 --> 02:43:04,579
Look at how you do that though. How do you do that? How do you make that happen?

817
02:43:05,219 --> 02:43:09,219
This is just a taxi driver coming. Yeah, it probably is.

818
02:43:09,219 --> 02:43:33,670
How did I get on one wheel? Oh my god. I, oh no. Space nitro is control. Handbrake is space

819
02:43:33,670 --> 02:43:45,799
nitro control. Horn H toggle lights. Nice desktop. All right, so we're gonna have to do,

820
02:43:45,799 --> 02:44:05,399
we need C L H N control. Control. There it is. Remember this? Remember this part of the video?

821
02:44:06,360 --> 02:44:30,069
I do. Let me actually like, I'm dropping in game currency. I lost. Fruising. He, I, he did

822
02:44:30,069 --> 02:44:42,979
the thing, but from the video? So this is just cruising around. I think I tried to go like

823
02:44:42,979 --> 02:44:56,569
5,000 miles per hour last time. Well, it's still going. Let's try it again. You have nitro,

824
02:44:56,569 --> 02:45:03,020
you can pin a nitro on it, but you can do it straight away. This is not really a good

825
02:45:03,020 --> 02:45:17,190
straight away. It's the mountains. Handbrake. Come on. Then I can do the joke. Yeah. I would

826
02:45:17,190 --> 02:45:25,510
call this one the most complete video game though. Don't you think? That didn't happen.

827
02:45:25,510 --> 02:45:30,709
That, that's patched version two. The one thing that they fixed in the game.

828
02:45:35,700 --> 02:45:52,139
The loudest water sound ever heard. It's turning. I'm going to hit it again.

829
02:45:53,020 --> 02:45:58,260
I need to hit five hundred miles per hour. Oh my fucking god. This is actually starting

830
02:45:58,260 --> 02:46:17,420
to aggravate me. Wheelie on slopes. That's probably a good idea. Straight away? I can't

831
02:46:17,420 --> 02:46:27,030
from this far away. No, no, not yet. Don't punch it yet. I got to get a complete straight away,

832
02:46:27,590 --> 02:46:34,780
which is no, not yet. He's being back seated on 700,000 games.

833
02:46:39,100 --> 02:46:46,889
Punch it. Okay. Stop. Slow down. This hurts my fucking head.

834
02:46:50,329 --> 02:47:07,190
How is second gear 200 miles per hour? It's straight away. I just wish it wouldn't be this

835
02:47:07,190 --> 02:47:25,030
long. Oh shit. It's so hard to control when you're going that fast. Last attempt.

836
02:47:25,829 --> 02:47:37,430
Are they more than two gears? I don't know. They might be straight away.

837
02:47:42,579 --> 02:47:48,260
Really? I don't fucking believe that for a second. How could you not have the gas

838
02:47:48,260 --> 02:48:09,159
station blow up? Still going? Yeah, it's just going down the street. Can I open the map?

839
02:48:09,319 --> 02:48:14,920
I mean, I know I shouldn't care this much about this, but I do. I need to do the joke.

840
02:48:18,100 --> 02:48:35,159
Otherwise this is a different movie. Reverse? I probably, yeah, I can go in reverse. Here we go.

841
02:48:35,159 --> 02:48:56,219
Straight away. This is it. You ready for the joke? That wasn't as good as the first movie.

842
02:48:56,860 --> 02:49:06,840
First movie was better. There's a jump here though. Why would you put a jump there and

843
02:49:06,840 --> 02:49:32,309
not let me go over it? It's the same shot. I know, right? What happened? What? I last drive

844
02:49:32,309 --> 02:49:41,430
into a wall. LOL moment. Nerdy. Here it comes. Whatever. It's done. Stream motorbike racing sucks.

845
02:49:43,239 --> 02:49:49,420
Wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Right back where we left it off.

846
02:49:53,909 --> 02:49:57,829
Wait, this is a new movie. This movie's new. I haven't seen this movie before.

847
02:49:58,629 --> 02:50:30,389
We've got a sequel. What the fuck is overhead right now?

848
02:50:31,350 --> 02:50:49,659
It's a casual zeppelin flying overhead. There you go. That was it. Thanks for playing.

849
02:50:52,760 --> 02:51:04,379
I don't even know what that was. What the fuck is it? I don't know where it is.

850
02:51:08,459 --> 02:51:19,620
Where is it? Extreme motor. There it is. Okay. All right. Well, you guys vote for the next one.

851
02:51:19,620 --> 02:51:24,069
I'm going to go grab some spaghetti. I'll be right back. I'm not doing that one again.

852
02:51:24,069 --> 02:51:30,229
Restart. Sorry. I'll be back in like two minutes. I'm not going to do BRB.

853
02:51:31,030 --> 02:57:00,780
Hey, that's pretty nice caterpillar or car. So it looks like I get it. Hey, it's streamers choice.

854
02:57:04,520 --> 02:57:09,350
You know what that means? I get to go anywhere in there and I think we're going to do

855
02:57:09,350 --> 02:57:24,100
parking lot parking lot maze. Thanks for voting. Parking lot maze. Welcome back.

856
02:57:24,100 --> 02:57:29,540
I'm like, I just ran up the stairs. I ate spaghetti with my hands and then came up and

857
02:57:29,540 --> 02:58:08,649
ran up the stairs. All right. What do we got here? Actually, I can drag the bottom.

858
02:58:09,370 --> 02:58:22,059
It's the first one I've been able to do that with. This music sucks.

859
02:58:22,940 --> 02:58:44,409
Turn it down. I don't know what the point was to do that. I'm sorry. All right. Start here.

860
02:58:44,409 --> 02:58:51,239
Monopoly. It's Fortnite Monopoly. Welcome to parking lot maze. Parking lot maze is a,

861
02:58:51,319 --> 02:59:00,100
come on. That's not even. Did you even try? I would see that and change that and fix that.

862
02:59:01,639 --> 02:59:06,200
Highly addictive puzzle game where your goal is to untangle the vehicles and restore traffic

863
02:59:06,200 --> 02:59:15,049
within the streets of Strestropolis. Strestropolis. Move the vehicles by clicking

864
02:59:15,049 --> 02:59:20,250
on them and clicking on an empty tile. I don't know what that says. However,

865
02:59:20,250 --> 02:59:34,709
you cannot move. I played this. It's just this thing. What? Yeah, I did it. The stress

866
02:59:34,709 --> 02:59:49,290
meter. Don't let stress meter fill up or you will lose a life. That's okay. Don't get stressed

867
02:59:49,290 --> 02:59:57,049
out and lose your life in traffic. Oh my God. That's fucking horrible. Okay. I got out.

868
02:59:57,209 --> 03:00:06,549
Got out of traffic. Solve. If you can't get it, you can just solve. I'm pretty,

869
03:00:06,549 --> 03:00:15,719
I'm pretty good at this shit. Multiple goals. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I get you.

870
03:00:30,579 --> 03:00:31,620
I know what I'm doing here, guys.

871
03:01:03,670 --> 03:01:28,649
Oh, he's so good. He's so fast at everything he does. I like this. This is fun. What a

872
03:01:28,649 --> 03:02:52,940
fucking terrible game. No. Yeah. You guys fucked it up. Hold on. Just my face. That's

873
03:02:52,940 --> 03:03:32,139
got to be bigger so you guys can actually click on it. Where am I? You do, you do a dick on my

874
03:03:32,139 --> 03:03:53,159
face one more time and I'll play chess again for the next six hours. Is that what you want? Holy

875
03:03:53,159 --> 03:03:57,399
shit. Wow. You're actually listening. All right. Let's get one more time. Nice and close.

876
03:04:19,479 --> 03:04:36,739
Yeah. Now you lose privileges for the next 10 years. What? I turned it off. Oh, it's because

877
03:04:36,739 --> 03:04:51,340
it's on the other scene. I get it. Okay. Where are we going? That was a car in the lot.

878
03:04:51,340 --> 03:05:19,370
Bust out 3D world. It's either, well, bust out 3D world or alchemy drop. Okay. Looks like

879
03:05:19,370 --> 03:05:29,319
alchemy drop. Let's play alchemy drop. Sure. Alchemy drop. Why am I, can I say that in a

880
03:05:29,319 --> 03:05:34,739
different tone or is it the same audio clip? Alchemy drop, alchemy drop, alchemy drop,

881
03:05:34,739 --> 03:05:43,979
alchemy drop. I can't do it. Alchemy drop, alchemy drop. There we go. Finally. Jesus.

882
03:05:47,590 --> 03:05:52,780
Alchemy drop. It's going to, I know this is going to be a match three game. We're

883
03:05:52,780 --> 03:05:57,500
going to be quitting it in two seconds. I'm reliving the nightmare I had last time

884
03:05:57,500 --> 03:06:53,219
in real time, live on camera. Fuck. I can't believe I'm doing this shit again.

885
03:06:53,219 --> 03:06:59,239
If you had told me three years ago that fast forward a couple of years and there was going

886
03:06:59,239 --> 03:07:04,040
to be another edition of this game that was supposed to be different and it was the same

887
03:07:04,040 --> 03:07:14,120
thing and I'm doing it again. Bust out world. All right. It's time to, it's time to start

888
03:07:14,120 --> 03:07:21,670
picking on myself for the next couple of rounds. Everybody wants to put a little dinky

889
03:07:21,670 --> 03:07:29,750
on the screen. All right. Let's go. Bust out 3D world. It's a 3D game. That means it's

890
03:07:29,750 --> 03:07:42,840
not going to work. You can try it though. It doesn't work. Hey, at least we're going

891
03:07:42,840 --> 03:07:47,399
through it quicker because the ones that, I wonder if it's the same ones that don't work.

892
03:07:47,399 --> 03:07:50,680
That would be hilarious actually. I need to go watch that video after this.

893
03:08:05,540 --> 03:08:09,219
Farmer crates is 3D and it works and it's from the video.

894
03:08:14,889 --> 03:08:33,610
Let's take us back. Oh, Jerma, you really cashed in on that video you made. All right.

895
03:08:33,610 --> 03:08:42,020
We're going to play Farmer, Farmer crates. Did I get this game for one cent? I got this

896
03:08:42,020 --> 03:08:52,700
game for, I think it was $11. Farmer crates did work in the last timeline. So let's see

897
03:08:52,700 --> 03:09:01,899
if it works in this one. Of course it does because this is the exact same collection

898
03:09:01,899 --> 03:09:08,840
and why is it opening on my other monitor? I am so confused. It's opening on my right

899
03:09:08,840 --> 03:09:16,500
monitor right now. This is not correct. So I'm going to put it into windowed.

900
03:09:23,659 --> 03:09:41,620
There's, there it is. It's another song. I don't know what it is. I don't want to play this again.

901
03:09:42,340 --> 03:09:48,180
Can I skip? Can I veto this one? I've already done it. I already know what this one is.

902
03:09:48,180 --> 03:09:53,829
I've already played this one. Remember? Oh, wow. Look at that face that guy has. It's a

903
03:09:53,829 --> 03:10:00,600
really scary face. He looks like a character from the Dark Crystal. I don't know whatever

904
03:10:00,600 --> 03:10:09,770
I said. Some reference. Joe, that's fine. I've done it. You've played all of them. Not all of

905
03:10:09,770 --> 03:10:14,409
them. Some of these didn't work. Some of these actually did not open. A lot of them didn't.

906
03:10:15,450 --> 03:10:26,809
Deja vu. No, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Good reference. Right.

907
03:10:34,299 --> 03:10:42,180
What is it? Three, two, one. And what is going on with this guy's work outfit? What?

908
03:10:42,180 --> 03:11:02,680
This guy puts on overalls and shoes to go to work and he's naked. Three, two, one. I mean,

909
03:11:03,239 --> 03:11:09,420
three, two, one. I mean, like, this guy belongs in a different video game. You know,

910
03:11:09,420 --> 03:11:27,819
he belongs in, he belongs in the Dark Crystal from the Muppets. I don't have any, I don't

911
03:11:27,819 --> 03:11:48,940
know what else to say. Oh, I fucked that up. Oh, Dobby. Dobby. Harry. Harry Potter.

912
03:11:55,879 --> 03:12:21,299
Did I do that one? Jeez. I thought, I thought this was going to be like a big deal.

913
03:12:21,299 --> 03:12:25,219
It was going to be a different thing, but it's just, no, no, no. It is a big deal. It is a big

914
03:12:25,219 --> 03:12:37,559
deal. And you guys thought that was it. You guys thought that there wasn't more. I thought

915
03:12:37,559 --> 03:12:58,100
there is more. Vegas Slot. This 4500 Vegas Slot. Oh, I'm doing that right now. This is

916
03:12:58,100 --> 03:13:24,229
streamers choice, guys. Sorry. Virtual Vegas Slot. So name guest player, name Bank Robert.

917
03:13:24,229 --> 03:13:29,530
No, not Bank Robber. Bank Roll. Bank Roll. Whatever. Who cares? It's a fucking, this

918
03:13:29,530 --> 03:13:53,700
game isn't stupid. Choose game and almost, it's coming. No, it was going to sneeze.

919
03:13:54,340 --> 03:13:58,819
All right. $100 super bets. I get $5,000. If you go hard, you fucking just go home.

920
03:13:59,459 --> 03:14:04,579
I'm going to go five real and we're going to do, I don't know, Dinosaur Dollars.

921
03:14:04,579 --> 03:14:09,379
Dinosaur Dollars blast him up. $100 bets. Deposit money into the machine.

922
03:14:09,379 --> 03:15:10,889
Where's my bankroll? What happened? All right, let's do it again. Let's do $100. And we're

923
03:15:10,889 --> 03:15:18,700
going to go to Chocolate Lover. Oh, I don't know. Okay. Deposit money. $5,000. Deposit.

924
03:15:19,579 --> 03:15:28,729
Choose how many lines I want. All of, all lines. Every line. All lines. 20 lines.

925
03:15:28,729 --> 03:15:34,520
20 lines. It's $100 per line. That's how much is that for one spin?

926
03:15:38,020 --> 03:15:44,489
That's, how much is that? That's 20. That's $2,000.

927
03:15:52,100 --> 03:15:57,219
I lost like 1400 bucks.

928
03:16:11,450 --> 03:16:48,100
Some Y outs. Give me some Y outs. I got like 10 grand on this credit card. This is it.

929
03:16:52,100 --> 03:18:21,239
Multi-millionaire tower of cash. Super sports. Do it. Those machines are stupid.

930
03:18:21,239 --> 03:18:27,239
Everybody knows the best machine at the casino is Betty White's fairy tales.

931
03:18:27,559 --> 03:18:33,399
Or the Ellen DeGeneres dance machine. Everybody knows that. They don't even fucking have those.

932
03:18:33,399 --> 03:19:06,100
So worst slot machine ever. Cheddar, Cheddar Fool. I don't, uh, looks like everyone wants

933
03:19:06,100 --> 03:19:24,870
me to play Cheddar Fool. Circular Pool. Okay, that's what that says. Right. I've

934
03:19:24,870 --> 03:19:30,309
waited three hours for Circular Pool. Well, I really hate to tell you this,

935
03:19:30,309 --> 03:19:35,190
but there is like a 40% chance that it doesn't work. Let's have some faith.

936
03:19:35,989 --> 03:19:54,360
Oh, you just have to have a little bit of faith. Cheddar Fool. Let's open it. Let's go.

937
03:20:19,700 --> 03:20:53,750
Balls are shmeez. And there's coins. You guys see this shit? Blue surface.

938
03:20:58,280 --> 03:21:02,940
Boxcar Bob. Boxcar Bob is going to break. Move the window. I can't,

939
03:21:03,739 --> 03:21:08,780
I physically can't do it. Yeah. I, if I'm, I'm going to side to side of the screen here

940
03:21:08,780 --> 03:21:36,780
and this is a crash computer game. I'll try it. I'm going to try it. Let me know how this looks.

941
03:21:47,129 --> 03:21:57,110
Better? All right. Boxcar Bob. This is cool. It's like a breakup with pool.

942
03:21:57,909 --> 03:22:05,100
This is really cool. Oh, you just have to like curling. You just got to get it out of

943
03:22:05,100 --> 03:22:12,870
the way. It's like sumo wrestling. All right. So what, what is he? Which one am I?

944
03:22:13,989 --> 03:22:27,750
Does it matter? How do I control the ball? The ball is just stuck on the,

945
03:22:28,469 --> 03:22:37,459
I can't move the ball into the center. It's always going to go off the side of the screen.

946
03:22:41,799 --> 03:22:54,819
Um, arrow keys. No, it's not the arrow keys. I'm moving the mouse.

947
03:23:06,889 --> 03:23:18,500
Okay. There we go. Oh, wait a minute. I get it. So it's up and down and left and right.

948
03:23:19,139 --> 03:23:27,370
The one thing that I really, you know, chat sometimes it's just so

949
03:23:27,370 --> 03:23:52,680
fucking irritating. Oh, you've just hit me. You struck me. Bully. All right. I'm going to get

950
03:23:52,680 --> 03:24:11,930
this one. Watch this one in the corner pocket. Uh, I think this is going to work. We got to

951
03:24:11,930 --> 03:24:32,120
go again, right? This music's making me depressed. Why? What an idiot. That's a free

952
03:24:32,120 --> 03:24:55,909
ball. Nice one, Bob. Is that the AI helping me? That's it. I won the game. He knocked in the,

953
03:24:55,909 --> 03:25:04,840
the eight ball. I win. Get out of here. See you later. Thanks for the free victory.

954
03:25:05,639 --> 03:25:38,649
That's it. It's time for me. Yeah. Oh, I can do that better. Oh, you want to fight?

955
03:25:38,649 --> 03:26:00,309
You want to fuck fight? Don't fuck come at me. Don't. Oh, I went too far. I was,

956
03:26:00,309 --> 03:26:07,290
I was looking at the camera. I actually fucked that one up and that's all right.

957
03:26:07,930 --> 03:26:12,899
Oh no, I need to see that. I have to see that. I was, that was a mistake.

958
03:26:13,620 --> 03:26:20,440
You didn't mean to do that one. My hand went too far and I didn't react fast enough.

959
03:26:20,440 --> 03:26:25,909
Did that actually just- No, that wasn't the right one. Don't fuck come at me.

960
03:26:35,059 --> 03:26:41,850
Holy shit. That, oh my God. That actually just happened. Wow. Oh, you want to fight?

961
03:26:42,790 --> 03:26:52,790
Don't fuck come at me. Holy shit. Yeah, I did not actually mean to do that.

962
03:26:53,430 --> 03:26:58,819
I was trying to time it with the kid. That was me actually doing that. Well, that was fun.

963
03:27:00,940 --> 03:27:15,299
I can't fucking believe that just happened. I was trying to do this joke where my hand

964
03:27:15,299 --> 03:27:26,389
comes all the way across and I turn and I turned it. I didn't turn at the right time.

965
03:27:26,389 --> 03:27:36,709
Well, that was, that was the worst part about that is the noise still happens.

966
03:27:41,670 --> 03:28:01,750
The fake joke noise still plays on top of it. Where the fuck is that? Unbelievable. I haven't

967
03:28:01,750 --> 03:28:10,469
even been drinking. I've had like coffee and food. I'll never live that one down.

968
03:28:11,270 --> 03:28:19,139
That'll be a clip that's posted forever. God damn it. Unbelievable.

969
03:28:19,139 --> 03:28:39,899
What the fuck am I going to do about that one? You want to fight? Don't fuck come at me.

970
03:28:41,479 --> 03:28:51,670
Oh my God. That's this so much regret here right now. I can't fucking believe that that happened.

971
03:28:51,670 --> 03:28:56,139
Oh, no. God.

972
03:29:02,040 --> 03:29:08,329
Of all the things to accidentally do, I would have rather shit my pants on stream

973
03:29:08,329 --> 03:29:26,389
because at least like I got a stomach ache and I shit my pants and there's gonna be so

974
03:29:26,389 --> 03:29:31,260
many people that think that that was on purpose and like how why would you not think

975
03:29:31,260 --> 03:29:35,500
that? But why would I do that? Like there's so many layers to how awful that just was.

976
03:29:41,479 --> 03:29:46,889
Fucking unbelievable. I can imagine the people that are already typing it right now like

977
03:29:46,889 --> 03:29:50,569
he just did that on purpose. What a fucking idiot. Like trying to get views. I know.

978
03:29:50,569 --> 03:29:58,250
I'm just, I'm just stupid. God damn it. What have I done?

979
03:30:02,170 --> 03:30:22,440
All right, vote on the next one. How am I going to explain that one to mom?

980
03:30:30,739 --> 03:30:35,780
Yeah, Jeremy, I was watching a clip on Twitch of you slapping yourself in the face.

981
03:30:36,180 --> 03:30:45,510
Why did you do that? Mom, I, I don't know how it happened but it did.

982
03:30:45,510 --> 03:30:49,430
That's people gonna edit that in places and it's gonna, oh my God. What the fuck.

983
03:30:51,190 --> 03:30:55,829
You can hear the embarrassment in my voice. Where's this going? 3D fucking circle pool.

984
03:31:02,040 --> 03:31:06,920
What did I do? Because I was pretending to miss the person in front of me and go around like

985
03:31:06,920 --> 03:31:12,440
a fucking three stooges video and I actually did the three stooges thing in real life.

986
03:31:22,040 --> 03:31:25,319
So it looks like we're going to classic, classic Pac-Man.

987
03:31:36,069 --> 03:31:43,959
Don't take it seriously. I mean, how can I at this point? All right, here we go.

988
03:31:43,959 --> 03:31:56,629
We're gonna go to classic Pac-Man. Ow, my ears. Okay, this is advertising a website.

989
03:31:58,870 --> 03:32:05,290
Oh yeah, I forgot. Yeah, this is the one with the monsters. Remember I'm like, oh,

990
03:32:05,290 --> 03:32:28,420
there's cars instead of ghosts. It's the same game. Well, I can fix that. Classic.

991
03:32:31,049 --> 03:32:38,229
Watch out for the monster. Yeah, it's the same. It's just Pac-Man and it's,

992
03:32:38,229 --> 03:32:41,350
don't go to that website. There's no reason for you to go to that website.

993
03:32:41,989 --> 03:32:59,219
Although Pac-Man, seriously, the fact that if you remove Pac-Man's eyes,

994
03:32:59,940 --> 03:33:10,659
he really is just fucking terrifying. What a scary fucking monster he really is with no eyes.

995
03:33:21,989 --> 03:33:26,250
Pac-Man didn't have eyes? Didn't have a little, little like eye? Well, that's

996
03:33:26,250 --> 03:33:43,770
like a clay version. Maybe, did he not have eyes? No, he didn't. What was it? Was it 1995

997
03:33:43,770 --> 03:33:50,420
when they gave him eyes? Yeah, don't go to that website. Why, I just told you not to go. Why

998
03:33:50,420 --> 03:33:55,659
would you go? Hey, I just went to that website and I fucked up my computer. Don't do that.

999
03:34:03,459 --> 03:34:11,659
If these games are free, why would they be put in this box? Whatever, game's fucking not even,

1000
03:34:11,659 --> 03:34:23,299
it's pretty good. Get that off the screen. All right, what we got? That was Pac-Man.

1001
03:34:26,120 --> 03:34:35,719
That was, oh sorry, let me rephrase that. That was illegal Pac-Man.

1002
03:34:35,719 --> 03:34:53,139
Illegal Pac-Man is now done. Where are we going now? Are you trying to click, what are you

1003
03:34:53,139 --> 03:34:59,059
trying to click down there? Are you trying to trick a jail runner or strike bowling?

1004
03:34:59,059 --> 03:35:09,559
I'm not sure which one you're trying to click on. That looks like you're trying

1005
03:35:09,559 --> 03:35:20,459
to go to bowling. I'm not sure. It could be anything. Strike bowling? Let's see if it opens.

1006
03:35:40,149 --> 03:35:54,899
Strike bowling it is. And uh, or maybe you click it on jail. It could be anything. Strike. Call you mom,

1007
03:35:54,899 --> 03:36:05,379
she's crying. That's it. Blurry.

1008
03:36:11,899 --> 03:37:36,920
Ali, Ali, haunted Ali. Let's see this. Can you still not hear me? Screams? My game was fucking

1009
03:37:36,920 --> 03:38:00,940
terrible anyways. There's a creepy pasta behind that game. Well, what's left? Actually, we took a

1010
03:38:00,940 --> 03:38:22,780
huge trunk out. Jail? Set this as the desktop background. You want the witch as the desktop

1011
03:38:22,780 --> 03:38:31,459
background? That's actually, I can't, that's too bright. That's horrible. No, that's too

1012
03:38:31,459 --> 03:39:07,450
bright. No. Hey, remember this? No, the witch can't be the background because that's fine.

1013
03:39:07,450 --> 03:39:21,620
Where are we going? Hey, this is your mother. Is everything all right? Mom, everything's fine.

1014
03:39:23,770 --> 03:39:37,059
Jail runner? You got it. Excuse me, did I miss something? Uh, no, you didn't miss anything.

1015
03:39:37,059 --> 03:40:08,329
This is Mac's escape. All right, so we got, uh, volume is fine. Start. Jail runner. Jalil

1016
03:40:08,329 --> 03:40:19,899
runner. All right, how do I start it? Uh, Mac grew up in 1960s when love, peace, freedom

1017
03:40:19,899 --> 03:40:25,819
were the ideals of youth. At school, Mac was abused for everything, even for the love

1018
03:40:26,459 --> 03:40:34,340
to, even for love to teacher Brown's daughter. You're good for nothing. Having finished school,

1019
03:40:34,340 --> 03:40:40,780
Mac became an artist, but no one bought his paintings. In spite of bad luck, Mac decided to

1020
03:40:40,780 --> 03:40:45,420
propose to Mary Brown, the teacher's daughter, if you forgot. And what a proposal without a

1021
03:40:45,420 --> 03:40:57,049
ring, but here we, here were no ways to get money. One day, a man in a Mac offered Mac

1022
03:40:57,850 --> 03:41:07,319
money for making some copies for him, but the stranger sold the Mac's copies as the originals.

1023
03:41:07,879 --> 03:41:16,250
The painter was sent to jail. Mary's parents wanted her to marry another man. So Mac escaped

1024
03:41:16,250 --> 03:41:45,030
from jail. How do I play? All right. All right. So go now. Can I press that?

1025
03:41:45,909 --> 03:41:52,600
What the hell? I can't jump. Oh, I did it. Now I need a key.

1026
03:41:53,479 --> 03:42:01,940
Is that it? Can I get this? I got that key. I have a shovel. Ah, the shovel knocks down. I get it.

1027
03:42:01,940 --> 03:42:11,350
I get it. I get it. I walked over the rat as a bridge somehow. How do I get over there? I have

1028
03:42:11,350 --> 03:42:26,809
to fall down? How the fuck am I supposed to do this? How do I get up there? Top left. Climb on

1029
03:42:26,809 --> 03:42:36,090
the pipe. I thought that was part of the background. I don't think I can climb it.

1030
03:42:36,090 --> 03:43:07,110
Not the big pipe? Like, it's done with this pipe. All right. What is that sound?

1031
03:43:10,069 --> 03:43:46,299
Oh, whoa! Ah! Jail little rat. I'm just gonna go through the middle. X level, you made it.

1032
03:43:46,940 --> 03:43:50,069
Well, that was fun. We got, we saw pretty much everything we needed to see.

1033
03:43:50,069 --> 03:44:00,889
How about that play? How's that for a play? That is a warden now.

1034
03:44:04,409 --> 03:44:12,700
Assuming he just follows you around. Oh, fuck. Okay. Watch out. Why are there ladders in a prison?

1035
03:44:12,700 --> 03:44:24,940
Is that a camera? What happens if I go near it? All right. Okay. Nice work.

1036
03:44:30,309 --> 03:44:38,170
Wait till them to cross. And then there it is. And then I'm going to go out on that one.

1037
03:44:38,170 --> 03:44:46,299
Whoa! All right. That's it. I win. That was a good game. That was another guy.

1038
03:44:47,020 --> 03:45:13,879
What else we got? That was Jail Break. Hidden Object Mania. That's not really what you want.

1039
03:45:26,840 --> 03:46:06,649
Hidden Object Mania. Or Texas Hold'em. I don't know where you guys are going. Looks like we're

1040
03:46:06,649 --> 03:46:17,879
doing Texas Hold'em. It's got 3D in the title. I don't think it's going to work. I will give

1041
03:46:17,879 --> 03:46:28,459
it an attempt. Oh, it is. It's opening. This is the same one as the video. Hey! Hey!

1042
03:46:28,459 --> 03:46:45,530
Another reference! You ready for more references? How do I start? Random people, random all.

1043
03:46:46,170 --> 03:46:56,379
Starting cash. Fucking trillion dollars or 9999999. Me? All right. Whatever.

1044
03:46:58,379 --> 03:47:10,420
Everybody gets that money. I thought that was just me. Fold. Fold. Call. Fold. Call. Fold.

1045
03:47:12,729 --> 03:47:28,680
Raise. Fold. Call. Call. Fold. Call. King seven. Check. Bet. Fold. Raise. Raise. Fold.

1046
03:47:30,280 --> 03:47:40,459

Call. Bet. Raise. Raise. Raise. Raise. Raise. Raise. Raise. Raise. Raise.

1050
03:48:35,620 --> 03:48:41,700
Raise. Raise. Call. What is it? You got a nine? I got a oh.

1051
03:48:46,860 --> 03:48:49,819
How much money did you just win? Eight hundred and forty-seven dollars?

1052
03:48:50,700 --> 03:49:02,040
How can I change the bet? Fold. Ace jack. Fold. Fold. Fold. Fold. Oh no. There goes 0.9%

1053
03:49:02,040 --> 03:49:20,729
of your cash. Fold. Call. Call. Fold. Bet. Raise. Raise. Raise. Raise. Call. Call. Bet.

1054
03:49:26,620 --> 03:49:44,709
Raise. Raise. Raise. I'm gonna have 5,500 people watching this. Raise. Call. Call. Bet.

1055
03:49:46,950 --> 03:50:06,280
I was about to fold. Raise. All right. Come on. I got a pair of jacks. Oh well. Where?

1056
03:50:08,700 --> 03:50:16,579
And I'm still, I'm gonna be real honest with you guys. My mind is still struggling with that

1057
03:50:16,579 --> 03:50:32,229
slap. It is. It's still fighting in my brain. Like the left and right hemispheres of your brain,

1058
03:50:32,229 --> 03:50:40,409
the left one is streaming, the right one is going. Man, that slap. Where are we going?

1059
03:50:49,780 --> 03:51:03,100
Oh, you want to go to hidden object mania? You barely touched yourself, you big baby. No,

1060
03:51:03,100 --> 03:51:11,579
I know I didn't do it that hard, but the fact that it happened is worse than shit in my pants

1061
03:51:11,579 --> 03:51:20,629
on stream. All right. Hidden object mania. Let's open it. I remember this one. This is the same

1062
03:51:20,629 --> 03:51:32,200
one. Same shit. You have to find. Dragon attack. It's just the, it's the, which one is

1063
03:51:32,200 --> 03:51:46,579
the difference? It's find the differences. Start. Is it starting? Why is there another window

1064
03:51:46,579 --> 03:52:04,360
here? I'm so confused. Did they just take screenshots? Hidden object mania bunny play.

1065
03:52:14,340 --> 03:52:29,899
It's not interactive, but it wasn't at all. It was interactive. Here you guys have, you guys

1066
03:52:29,899 --> 03:53:08,329
play. Start. What do you think I'm doing? Click the stuff. Click the X. This is what

1067
03:53:08,329 --> 03:53:12,780
you get for not folding. All right. So did you guys find it? Yeah. Okay. I see the,

1068
03:53:12,780 --> 03:53:19,100
the red cheek here. Again, I thought it was a slap again. They're just, you got,

1069
03:53:19,100 --> 03:53:27,690
it's just, just trying to remind me of things. The starfish is different over here.

1070
03:53:31,030 --> 03:53:40,229
The pens, the eyes are different color. Good work. The pencil is in the middle. Pencil,

1071
03:53:40,229 --> 03:54:01,819
pencil. What about the pencil? This is flash player eight. Enter. You guys did a pretty

1072
03:54:01,819 --> 03:54:37,270
good job. I think you found, you found most of the things. Nice work guys. My God. So

1073
03:54:37,350 --> 03:54:46,739
there are, there are, there are over 1200 clips of this stream. That's like double or triple

1074
03:54:46,739 --> 03:55:16,549
what it normally is. All right. We're going, uh, boker drop or mystery Moscow.

1075
03:55:26,600 --> 03:55:33,000
He didn't play cubic frenzy. Not yet. All right. It looks like it's split between,

1076
03:55:33,000 --> 03:55:44,059
uh, boker drop and mystery Moscow. Let's go ahead and open it. Okay. I'm going to do all

1077
03:55:44,059 --> 03:55:49,579
the mystery cities in a row because they're, they're the same game. Mystery New York,

1078
03:55:49,579 --> 03:55:53,260
mystery Paris, mystery Moscow. They're all the same. So let's just get them over with.

1079
03:55:54,569 --> 03:56:04,469
Here we go. In three, two, one action. Same company, same game, same volume, same thing.

1080
03:56:08,170 --> 03:56:25,479
No witch this time. What's the point of the voting if it's just anarchy?

1081
03:56:26,739 --> 03:56:33,559
Well, I mean, the consensus usually is about 20, 30% every time. Usually toaster. No bat

1082
03:56:34,520 --> 03:56:44,520
tire bunny. This is Moscow, right? I don't know how an apartment building is just Moscow. It's

1083
03:56:44,520 --> 03:57:17,979
just a apartment. Mystery Paris. I really hope we see a witch. That would be so funny.

1084
03:57:30,870 --> 03:57:35,450
Here's New York. We got to get through these quickly.

1085
03:57:39,530 --> 03:57:41,690
I'm looking for a witch. I don't want it so bad.

1086
03:57:42,569 --> 03:58:02,579
Jerma witch and emote and Jerma slap. But what, how would I even make the slap and emote?

1087
03:58:03,299 --> 03:58:23,610
It would have to be right on contact. Well, that was fun. Those, there's a lobster there.

1088
03:58:24,250 --> 03:58:31,639
What are you linking here? See, everything's fine. I'm good.

1089
03:58:32,440 --> 03:58:57,190
Bruise? There's no bruise. Look, my face is just like that. I have like a redder face

1090
03:58:57,190 --> 03:59:04,440
right now because it's hot in here. Got a black eye. I don't have a black eye. I'm just tired.

1091
03:59:08,579 --> 03:59:32,579
Set as wallpaper. Fuck me. Fine. Which one am I going to put as the wallpaper?

1092
03:59:32,579 --> 04:00:30,440
Where we going? Oh, that's right. The mystery, all the mystery cities. I have,

1093
04:00:30,440 --> 04:00:47,079
oh, what have I done? Mystery Paris, mystery, mystery New York, mystery. What the hell is

1094
04:00:47,079 --> 04:01:07,510
the other one here? Mystery Moscow. And then next to that, Poker Drop. Let's give it a try.

1095
04:01:07,510 --> 04:01:57,190
Gamesoft. 2000 Sweet Leaf Studios. Windows NT. This is Tetris? Cards? What the fuck?

1096
04:01:57,190 --> 04:02:12,809
What's, what's happening right now? Oh, I can choose. Wouldn't a pair work if it was poker?

1097
04:02:12,809 --> 04:02:19,319
How does that make any sense? That's three. That's three of a kind.

1098
04:02:19,319 --> 04:02:39,780
Does it mean next to each other? Read them and weep.

1099
04:02:43,959 --> 04:03:03,579
Read them and weep. Well, that was fun. Special thanks. What are you, what are you clicking

1100
04:03:03,579 --> 04:03:28,250
on? What were you clicking? Nothing. Nice background. Thanks. I may as well own it.

1101
04:03:30,600 --> 04:03:38,250
Poker Drop. Tetris with poker, but I don't know. I have no idea what it was.

1102
04:03:38,250 --> 04:03:48,920
He lacks the knowledge of what occurred. Do I though? I looked at you making a triangle.

1103
04:04:04,250 --> 04:04:19,219
We got it. No. Tank Battle is currently winning. Goddamn Tank Battle. Let me see

1104
04:04:19,219 --> 04:04:24,629
what you're doing. Oh, let me see. This is the clip. Holy shit. This is,

1105
04:04:24,870 --> 04:04:30,440
a pair of work. How could you even see anything? It's like,

1106
04:04:35,239 --> 04:05:03,739
this is unwatchable. Oh, unwatchable. We're going to Tank Battle. Let's see if it opens.

1107
04:05:09,190 --> 04:05:19,139
Nope. It doesn't open. No Tank Battle for us. Might as well put the X on it.

1108
04:05:19,139 --> 04:05:38,579
Hey, you got any other ideas? 100%. What the fuck? What is it? The number is being,

1109
04:05:38,579 --> 04:05:52,780
it's covering everything. What is that? Aquarium Shop. Let's give it a go. This one opens.

1110
04:05:52,780 --> 04:05:59,350
That's a good sign. Just kind of is in the corner like all these other dumb games.

1111
04:06:18,889 --> 04:06:29,129
It was London? Well, are you sure? I feel like I'm going to like this one. This one might

1112
04:06:29,129 --> 04:06:40,389
give me at least 10 minutes. All right, options. Let's get the music a little bit lower because

1113
04:06:40,389 --> 04:06:47,180
I mean you can't even hear a damn thing. Star Game. How does it work? Same company

1114
04:06:47,180 --> 04:06:52,760
that made the other one probably. What's she holding? Since my parents worked as lifeguards,

1115
04:06:52,760 --> 04:06:56,840
I spent my childhood by the sea. I discovered the beauty hidden beneath the surface of the

1116
04:06:56,840 --> 04:07:02,040
ocean during my first visit to the aquarium. Enchanted. I decided to work in an aquarium

1117
04:07:02,040 --> 04:07:13,399
when I grew up. Sealand. Now it's time to make my dreams come true to get started. I

1118
04:07:13,399 --> 04:07:19,059
bought an old house by the sea. The previous owner didn't take good care of it, but I plan

1119
04:07:19,059 --> 04:07:25,100
on making some improvements. Is that supposed to be the house? With my help, these baby fish

1120
04:07:25,100 --> 04:07:33,829
will grow to be beautiful adult specimens. This is the house you bought. Hello, Jenny's

1121
04:07:33,829 --> 04:07:39,340
fish shop. At last, my first order. Select a pet to keep you company during the game.

1122
04:07:39,340 --> 04:07:43,020
Sharky will help you take care of fish and Taz will lend you a hand if time is running out.

1123
04:07:46,620 --> 04:08:01,670
Taz. Yeah, I agree. Big fish. Helicopter pad. Play. It's my first day. I'm going to be

1124
04:08:01,670 --> 04:08:04,629
receiving orders to raise fish. I should get familiar with my equipment.

1125
04:08:05,190 --> 04:08:31,530
Now it's another one of these. So they bring fish to my store. Why is he locked in here?

1126
04:08:32,489 --> 04:09:20,200
Oh, okay. All right. Get him out. Box him up. What's that money? 32 bucks sold.

1127
04:09:21,159 --> 04:09:47,989
No, is that right? I think I got it. What's wrong?

1128
04:09:51,979 --> 04:10:11,559
Hold on. I got him. He's fine. Turtle saved everybody. Let me make that money.

1129
04:10:12,280 --> 04:10:34,360
Is this a real game? Yeah. Taz is supposed to be in here. He's not drowning. He's a

1130
04:10:34,360 --> 04:10:47,879
turtle. They live in the ocean. He gives more time. I get it. Pet shop or daycare.

1131
04:10:49,879 --> 04:10:56,420
Yeah, they pretty much come to your place for you to feed. Can't do anything else.

1132
04:10:57,379 --> 04:11:05,860
Turtles can't breathe underwater. We'll blame people that made this game. I didn't make it.

1133
04:11:06,579 --> 04:11:17,500
I had nothing to do with this. You did? Well, then you should have known better.

1134
04:11:22,600 --> 04:11:35,020
$259. Three minutes of work. Pretty sick. Why did it take that long for that to pop up?

1135
04:11:35,979 --> 04:11:56,340
All right. Let's have a little chat. Let's see where we are right now.

1136
04:11:56,340 --> 04:12:15,610
We are at... where is this one? Okay. I'm not opening that one. I don't care. All right. So

1137
04:12:15,610 --> 04:12:28,340
we have... we're pretty much at the 50 to 60. We're at like 60 percentile. No, I'm not doing

1138
04:12:28,340 --> 04:12:40,780
that one. It's already covered. Mystery London is Mystery New York. See? Look, I opened it.

1139
04:12:41,500 --> 04:13:02,069
All right. Now what? Picks up notes. That was a nice speed run.

1140
04:13:04,700 --> 04:13:08,139
Did he already play Farmer Crates? Oh yeah. If it's got an X on it means we already did it.

1141
04:13:16,819 --> 04:13:25,299
We seem to be very split. 16% are clicking on one that has already been shown on screen.

1142
04:13:31,670 --> 04:13:44,409
16% want. Oh, it's close. Taxi? Yeah. Looks... no, hold on. But these are already done. Why

1143
04:13:44,409 --> 04:13:50,090
are you guys clicking over here? Should I even ask that question? Stone Age Taxi. There it is.

1144
04:13:50,090 --> 04:14:08,389
All right. Let's go. That isn't the first pack. Stone Age Taxi. No, it's not the first pack.

1145
04:14:08,389 --> 04:14:24,819
What fucking pack is this in? This one. We've played this one already. No. Got him. Got him.

1146
04:14:32,709 --> 04:15:05,350
Got that guy. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. We in trouble? Not good. Not good. Don't do it to us.

1147
04:15:05,350 --> 04:15:27,559
Wow. Why is it the click? I can't even... no, what is this like doing? Get off! Get...

1148
04:15:27,559 --> 04:15:45,940
what are you doing? It took over my whole computer again. Leaked. Yeah, I leaked out like

1149
04:15:46,579 --> 04:15:58,700
the menu. Oh, there's this... there's nothing there. This might... maybe you might have seen

1150
04:15:58,700 --> 04:16:44,120
my recycling bin. What's going on back here? I hate that I have to do this. What a crock of

1151
04:16:44,120 --> 04:17:04,920
shit. All right. Here we go. Played this one. Kid mode. This one. I do. You can run the

1152
04:17:05,000 --> 04:17:18,620
people over and shit. I remember it. What reference can I make? Oh, in kid mode you can't kill the

1153
04:17:18,620 --> 04:17:56,120
cavemen. You can kill them in the adult mode. You're welcome. How's this for kid mode? Nope.

1154
04:18:02,760 --> 04:18:08,860
Want to see the difference? Here's the difference.

1155
04:18:20,459 --> 04:18:25,610
There's the difference. They were really concerned about kids running people over,

1156
04:18:25,610 --> 04:18:36,950
apparently. Damn it. These all suck so bad. Oh, what about the kids? We have to take care

1157
04:18:36,950 --> 04:19:17,540
of the kids. It's down here. Hmm. Tennis champion. Penguin push. Uh, looks like we're

1158
04:19:17,540 --> 04:19:26,260
going to do... oh, it's kind of... I don't know. Tennis? Is this big head tennis?

1159
04:19:29,260 --> 04:19:44,139
Yeah, this is probably big head tennis, from what I remember. This is what you waited for,

1160
04:19:44,139 --> 04:19:49,659
ladies and gentlemen. That's right. Big head tennis. You guys always try to find a way to

1161
04:19:49,659 --> 04:20:05,700
slip in that thing. All right, let's put it on. Tennis championship. Uh, no. No, I don't know

1162
04:20:05,700 --> 04:20:34,260
what this means, so I'm not going to do that. I don't know. Why does it need that? Direct play.

1163
04:20:34,260 --> 04:20:48,549
It's safe? Skip installation. No, it's going to sit there for fucking 10 minutes and install it.

1164
04:20:48,549 --> 04:21:23,479
Why did I just teleport? Skip. That's just... that's not a monster. Side burns? They're

1165
04:21:23,479 --> 04:21:37,899
fine. They're fine. They're correct. The closet opened on its own. Oh, it did it now. Did the

1166
04:21:37,899 --> 04:21:51,819
closet open on its own? They're not two different lengths. It did. The closet opened on its own.

1167
04:21:52,379 --> 04:22:18,729
Show me a clip. They actually are uneven. Bullshit. No, they're not. That's just the way

1168
04:22:18,729 --> 04:22:25,399
that my face is shaped. See, there's just less hair here. I have to get my haircut. Look.

1169
04:22:25,399 --> 04:22:34,940
Look at the ear. Right here on the ear. Right there. Look at the ear. Right there. See?

1170
04:22:34,940 --> 04:22:57,139
They're even. He's so bald. How could you call this so bald? I mean, it's... I'm receding, but it's not...

1171
04:22:58,020 --> 04:23:05,479
Don't let him get to you. Don't let him get to you. I'll do two hands this time and go around

1172
04:23:05,479 --> 04:23:09,959
and hit both cheeks. I almost did it again. And here's how that happened. I figured it out.

1173
04:23:10,600 --> 04:23:14,760
So I'm looking at the preview right now because... well, I'm looking at the preview.

1174
04:23:14,760 --> 04:23:19,719
I was gauging how far... I almost did it again because I can't gauge the distance by

1175
04:23:19,719 --> 04:23:25,110
looking at the preview on the screen. Can you imagine if I fucking just smashed both

1176
04:23:25,110 --> 04:23:38,540
sides of my face right there? For the love of God. All right. Anyways, uneven bald spots.

1177
04:23:39,100 --> 04:23:49,379
That's fine. Who just gave bits? Who are you? The guy on the tennis championship icon is just

1178
04:23:49,379 --> 04:23:53,879
you when you were doing the green screen walk, but someone has edited a tennis racket into

1179
04:23:53,879 --> 04:24:28,069
your hand. That's fucking funny. Well, tennis doesn't work. Okay, why is it? Because

1180
04:24:28,069 --> 04:24:42,629
the window's 10. And I did all this shit to... whatever. Tennis walk doesn't work. Where are

1181
04:24:42,629 --> 04:25:04,579
we heading? Might be penguin push. Possible. That might be air strike. Maybe the doctor lab.

1182
04:25:05,700 --> 04:25:25,670
It's gonna be penguin push. If it's... oh, when we do jewel wizardry, I'm gonna do the line.

1183
04:25:26,760 --> 04:25:31,479
Oh fuck. Did I just... no, it's gonna... it's penguin push. No, it's not. What the fuck?

1184
04:25:39,180 --> 04:25:46,180
Well, we might as well get it out of the way. I feel like I'm doing stand up. Remember I told

1185
04:25:46,180 --> 04:25:53,379
you how I have a tour of the country with my... my popular video? I just get up on the stage and

1186
04:25:53,379 --> 04:26:07,159
I'm just like, ladies and gentlemen. Yeah, I got the mic in my hand. I'm just like,

1187
04:26:07,959 --> 04:26:15,020
so you know, how are you guys doing? Are you guys doing good? Yeah! Jewel wizardry!

1188
04:26:15,659 --> 04:26:39,510
That's what I'm doing right now. This is like the fifth or sixth town I've been to. I wonder

1189
04:26:39,510 --> 04:26:47,959
if I can get the whole thing correct. In fact, let's see. Let's see if I can get it. Jewel

1190
04:26:49,000 --> 04:27:11,559
wizardry. Give me a moment though. I need to queue this up. All right, where is it?

1191
04:27:19,739 --> 04:27:27,290
See? Look! Remember this part? I can't stop it. See? The same thing happened.

1192
04:27:27,290 --> 04:27:37,559
My computer. So, you know, when I... this is real. We're just doing the video again.

1193
04:27:39,079 --> 04:27:47,379
All right, where... where's jewel wizardry? Where is... there it is. See if I can get this.

1194
04:27:48,500 --> 04:28:00,309
Here we go. Okay, I'm gonna try. Make sure you can hear it. I haven't seen this video in a

1195
04:28:00,309 --> 04:28:35,459
long time. I think I know what I said though. Incoming jewel wizardry. You're gonna do it?

1196
04:28:38,299 --> 04:28:45,899
What the fuck are you doing? You're telling me jewel wizardry is not even gonna open.

1197
04:28:45,899 --> 04:28:53,590
You gotta be kidding me. I... where is it? I don't see it anywhere.

1198
04:29:00,420 --> 04:29:41,020
What is this? What are you linking here? What are you linking? What is this? I'm not gonna

1199
04:29:41,020 --> 04:29:52,680
look at that on camera. I need to make sure you guys can see this. All right, I'm just gonna

1200
04:29:52,680 --> 04:30:06,500
go. Here we go. Can I get it? A classic game. A game of jewel wizardry. If you think you're

1201
04:30:06,500 --> 04:30:15,299
powerful enough to try to challenge a road in a red dress and a Diablo 2 paladin scepter.

1202
04:30:18,469 --> 04:30:22,489
I... I did it kind of good. Oh, I get it. I actually get it. I get it.

1203
04:30:23,209 --> 04:30:48,659
That's close enough. He hasn't changed at all. Not quite. Can I like...

1204
04:30:50,120 --> 04:30:57,209
Hold on. God damn it. Let's try this again. I'll get the whole thing this time.

1205
04:30:57,209 --> 04:31:20,139
I'm gonna wait till it's ready. Okay, let's do it again. No, never mind. We're not doing

1206
04:31:20,139 --> 04:31:31,750
that again. Oh, it's a classic. The classic game of jewel wizardry. ASDF. Was it the same

1207
04:31:31,750 --> 04:32:00,600
in the video? Because that would be very, very strange. Yes, it was. What? No way. Oh,

1208
04:32:00,600 --> 04:32:07,219
that has to be default. Because I'm on a different computer on a different internet.

1209
04:32:08,180 --> 04:32:28,809
In a different state. Oh, okay. Oh, I get it. Ready? Oh, okay. Oh, I get it. Oh,

1210
04:32:28,809 --> 04:32:47,559
it's kind of cool. Nice. Oh, okay. Oh, I get it. Can't do that one. Oh, okay.

1211
04:32:54,459 --> 04:33:17,959
Point. I fucked it up. There's a bonus inside this triangle. I can't get it out.

1212
04:33:20,409 --> 04:33:59,750
Oh, okay. I get it. It's actually kind of fun. Nice. Quick, use the Diablo 2

1213
04:33:59,750 --> 04:35:18,330
Paladin Scepter. What does this do then? This actually might be the most interesting game

1214
04:35:18,330 --> 04:35:24,090
like this whole thing. I think I did say that. Let's just repeat the same video, the same thing.

1215
04:35:25,209 --> 04:35:38,180
Come on, Jeremy. Say it. Bonus. Not easy yet. Aquarium shop was the best? I think I'm out of

1216
04:35:38,180 --> 04:35:43,930
the disability there. I don't like the time management bullshit.

1217
04:35:55,779 --> 04:35:59,860
What about Jail Run? No, that game sucked, too.

1218
04:36:03,430 --> 04:36:10,360
Jewel Wizardry is actually pretty great. You know, for its time, I think it was kind of way

1219
04:36:11,000 --> 04:36:23,459
ahead of its time. See, they took the game Tetris that they didn't make. Changed it a

1220
04:36:23,459 --> 04:36:57,669
little bit. Got it. Come on, hurry up. Hurry up. Nice. Pretty good. Sponsored stream.

1221
04:37:26,790 --> 04:37:51,500
That was good. That was Jewel Wizardry. Just like the, remember the last time we did it? It

1222
04:37:51,500 --> 04:38:10,680
was so much fun. You're too old. That's why you like mom games. Mom games? I don't even

1223
04:38:10,680 --> 04:38:20,700
know what that means. Could have guessed that the next one was going to be Penguin Push.

1224
04:38:26,979 --> 04:38:46,540
What games does your mom play? My mom doesn't play any games. Why? Because, I don't know,

1225
04:38:46,540 --> 04:38:57,130
she doesn't play video games. She's not a gamer. I'm trying to think the last game. You know

1226
04:38:57,130 --> 04:39:03,900
what? The last game that my mother played was Grand Theft Auto 3 because we were like,

1227
04:39:03,900 --> 04:39:08,840
Mom, you try. And she's like, I don't know about this. This seems crazy. And then she

1228
04:39:08,840 --> 04:39:18,819
smashed into a wall and she got scared. So she never did it again. All right, Penguin Push.

1229
04:40:09,049 --> 04:40:32,099
Is direct play safe to enable? Let's see. Is direct play safe now? Is it safe now? What

1230
04:40:32,099 --> 04:40:44,900
do you mean now? Badgers, I don't trust this bullshit. I can't host using sockets

1231
04:40:44,900 --> 04:40:53,299
because I run ICS as well. You mean that disc erasing effect. I think that was fixed ages ago.

1232
04:40:54,889 --> 04:41:18,009
What? Why is that so scary? Is that correct? All right, this is on. Once installed, it won't

1233
04:41:18,009 --> 04:41:26,220
cause a VAC BAM when I play other games, right? And somebody writes, direct play is an API inside

1234
04:41:26,220 --> 04:41:38,069
of DirectX. It shouldn't cause any issues with other games. I'm going to fucking crash my

1235
04:41:38,069 --> 04:41:57,290
goddamn entire PC. Install. It's installing right now. Did it work? Oh, fuck. What

1236
04:41:57,369 --> 04:43:00,020
happened? Are we good? Penguin Popper. It's too much. Playing is easy. You and a friend play

1237
04:43:00,020 --> 04:43:04,580
penguins who have to escape the nasty Eskimos and their pets. You move through the levels by

1238
04:43:04,580 --> 04:43:09,830
squashing all the Eskimos and their pets. You do this by pushing blocks. There are four

1239
04:43:09,830 --> 04:43:23,240
different enemies to watch out for. Pushing the ice blocks. This is just, I'm at a concert

1240
04:43:23,240 --> 04:44:05,340
and the guy on the piano got way too into it. Oh, what happened? Let's delete it. Come on,

1241
04:44:05,340 --> 04:44:57,299
let's see those hands. I think I broke something. Nope, I'm not doing that. That would have been

1242
04:44:57,299 --> 04:45:14,779
really bad. I have shorts on. I am having another slap moment on this stream. End tutorial.

1243
04:45:15,500 --> 04:45:25,000
I was going to go like this with my feet like dun dun dun. No fucking way. Not right

1244
04:45:25,080 --> 04:45:47,500
now. What happened? 80 levels. 80 games in this one. Watch this. Watch this.

1245
04:45:48,619 --> 04:46:10,759
Up! Oh, I get it. It's Kenny himself. I'm trying to get the mouse off the screen.

1246
04:46:18,119 --> 04:47:04,439
Fuck. Wait, I can go through. I'm so glad I didn't just show like my fucking legs.

1247
04:47:05,319 --> 04:47:08,360
Somebody would have freeze framed and it would have been, I would have gotten

1248
04:47:09,240 --> 04:47:16,200
banned from Twitch forever. All it takes is one guy to like, one guy just has to freeze

1249
04:47:16,200 --> 04:47:20,040
frame the exact second that I like turn my legs over with shorts on and all of a sudden you're

1250
04:47:20,040 --> 04:47:35,319
gone. I can't have that. We live in the fucking digital age. Wait, what's this? Yeah, I know,

1251
04:47:35,319 --> 04:47:58,360
one guy. Diner Drop. Uh, I veto that one. It's going to be Diner Dash, but a different name.

1252
04:48:04,220 --> 04:48:22,439
What's this? Oh, okay. We're going to put a penis. Hey, hey, what do you think we should do?

1253
04:48:22,439 --> 04:48:26,119
Hey, hey, hey, chat. Hey, what do you want to do? Hey, shh, don't tell him. Hey,

1254
04:48:26,119 --> 04:48:34,860
don't tell him. We're going to put a penis. Hey, don't tell him. Alright, I'm turning on

1255
04:48:34,860 --> 04:48:51,979
Diner Drop. Wrong and it's free. Refused to say the website.com. That's not it. That's my face.

1256
04:48:53,880 --> 04:49:03,849
There it is. Do you really give a shit if this is not on the right spot? I don't think anybody

1257
04:49:03,849 --> 04:49:22,409
does. Yeah, come on. This is a, you're running a stream here. Well, what? Simple moves. Get three

1258
04:49:22,409 --> 04:49:26,330
or more identical food items in a row and they will disappear. You may swap adjacent elements

1259
04:49:26,330 --> 04:49:29,369
if you swap the elements, but the elements don't appear. They will return back to their

1260
04:49:29,369 --> 04:49:35,209
original place in less surprise. The objective of this game is to clear the entire field of time.

1261
04:49:36,009 --> 04:49:38,889
If you gather four or five identical food items, then you'll be ready with money. Okay,

1262
04:49:38,889 --> 04:49:44,409
he doubled up. That's so much information that I don't, who's going to read this?

1263
04:49:44,409 --> 04:50:03,659
That's so much. It's still going. It's a lot of tutorials here. Cool. It's one of these

1264
04:50:03,659 --> 04:50:11,450
games. So we've got cheese danishes, cheese hot dogs, three ice cream cones. These look,

1265
04:50:12,090 --> 04:50:18,409
it's rotten. That's a rotten bun. There's no such thing as a sesame seed hot dog bun.

1266
04:50:18,409 --> 04:50:24,119
Is there? I don't think there is. Is there a sesame seed hot dog bun?

1267
04:50:31,700 --> 04:50:35,369
There is? I've never seen it in my 38 years of life.

1268
04:50:54,659 --> 04:51:01,380
I'll tell you guys the story of how I spent probably 37 or 38 dollars of my life

1269
04:51:01,380 --> 04:51:20,680
on one of these games. I played one of these and I spent like 38 bucks. I played it for like

1270
04:51:20,680 --> 04:51:31,319
a year. I forget what it's called. It was like mystery gem drop or something and it was this

1271
04:51:31,319 --> 04:51:36,439
fake stupid where you solve mysteries but you don't just a match three game and I

1272
04:51:36,439 --> 04:51:39,689
don't know why I did it. There's no reason to.

1273
04:51:43,849 --> 04:51:54,279
No, it wasn't bejeweled. No, it wasn't. It wasn't. It was not that.

1274
04:52:04,040 --> 04:52:13,639
Got it. Only one more tile to clear. Order and pick up text is outside the box.

1275
04:52:19,990 --> 04:52:23,189
You just don't care at that point. You don't care.

1276
04:52:24,150 --> 04:52:34,490
How could you care? It's just that's just so

1277
04:52:36,330 --> 04:52:39,369
you just don't you don't even mind that that's there.

1278
04:52:43,020 --> 04:53:06,650
Come on. Come on. Oh wow. Why would I play that game? In fact, why am I playing this one?

1279
04:53:11,830 --> 04:53:32,650
That was that was uh commander crunch. Diner drop. Airstrike. I guarantee this one doesn't work.

1280
04:53:32,650 --> 04:53:51,959
I'm gonna I mean it's pretty unanimous right now. I 100% guarantee. I'll try it. I have 699,000

1281
04:53:51,959 --> 04:54:00,779
games left to play. I gotta pick up the pace. Well what needs to happen is I gotta pick up

1282
04:54:00,779 --> 04:54:09,000
the pace. You're right. I'm gonna just close it for now just in case it flashes on the screen.

1283
04:54:10,950 --> 04:54:31,369
No. I'm ready. How to play. The year 19XX. So fill in the blank there.

1284
04:54:32,740 --> 04:54:36,659
Third Reich has cloned thousands of zombie pilots in secret labs to support the plan

1285
04:54:36,659 --> 04:54:46,279
of conquering the world. To bring the world down and to stop the Nazi and the figure and

1286
04:54:46,279 --> 04:54:51,479
to just build an allied commander has called up three pilots in order to destroy the anime

1287
04:54:51,479 --> 04:55:04,409
at any cost. Skyfire. Ray, Annie, or Wolf. I won't speed. How do you play? Not like that.

1288
04:55:05,049 --> 04:55:26,090
It's just it's just Raiden. I'm sorry Raiden 2. Raiden 2. Yeah it's a shmup. Not really

1289
04:55:26,090 --> 04:55:33,799
because it's running at about 22 frames a second. It's hard to have a shmup

1290
04:55:33,799 --> 04:55:52,860
when the game runs like this. This shit in serial anymore. Is there a reason they stop doing that?

1291
04:55:54,220 --> 04:56:01,580
Just contact this company. Fucking Frosted Flakes. And replace this with Tony the Tiger.

1292
04:56:07,029 --> 04:56:09,430
How easy that would be and how cool everyone would think that was.

1293
04:56:10,470 --> 04:56:31,209
How about that be like Snap, Crackle, Pup. There are 25 enemies left. I can get them.

1294
04:56:32,169 --> 04:56:46,020
Let's play well. Tony the Tiger against the Nazis.

1295
04:56:50,500 --> 04:56:55,400
Yeah. Are you telling me you don't think that that would be worth playing?

1296
04:57:10,709 --> 04:57:22,380
It would definitely be. Yeah that's what I'm saying. All right I win. What do I get level?

1297
04:57:22,380 --> 04:57:28,360
How did I get to level three? This isn't worth playing. But it is worth playing if it was

1298
04:57:28,360 --> 04:57:42,700
for free in a cereal box. This can't be worth more money to make than the same Hot Wheels car

1299
04:57:42,700 --> 04:57:49,590
every year. You know how much it was probably to license Frozen from Disney to put in the

1300
04:57:49,590 --> 04:57:58,279
fucking Happy Meals? If they had just, well I was going to say put Elsa in here. But now

1301
04:57:58,279 --> 04:58:02,919
they didn't need Disney licensing. Forget about the licensing. Just put a piece of cereal here.

1302
04:58:03,720 --> 04:58:10,979
You don't have to have a licensed character. If it's cornflakes put the fucking rooster on here.

1303
04:58:10,979 --> 04:58:17,479
Who cares? You don't need a licensed Disney character. Put Ronald McDonald on here.

1304
04:58:18,119 --> 04:58:27,930
Cornflakes are disgusting. Let me just talk about that real quick.

1305
04:58:33,770 --> 04:58:41,990
You know I would rather slap myself in the face than eat cornflakes. They're good. How

1306
04:58:41,990 --> 04:58:49,459
could you say something like that? They're not. They just, they smell. Have you ever

1307
04:58:49,459 --> 04:58:52,819
smelled cornflakes? Pour some milk on a bowl of cornflakes and smell it.

1308
04:58:53,860 --> 04:58:57,060
I guarantee you you're gonna go. That's kind of, that's disgusting. What the hell am I eating?

1309
04:59:07,189 --> 04:59:10,150
So you'd rather shit yourself than cornflakes. That's not what I said.

1310
04:59:11,270 --> 04:59:26,619
Yeah it smells like sour. Like kind of like cheese. Like rotten cheese. Every time I put

1311
04:59:26,619 --> 04:59:55,819
milk on it. I don't know what it is. Something weird. Where we going? Oops. Sorry. Spoiled milk

1312
04:59:55,819 --> 05:00:07,380
joke minus 20. Yeah. Yeah I could see that. All right. Doctor lab or tomb raider? Tomb

1313
05:00:07,380 --> 05:00:22,869
momer. I think we're going to the doctor lab. Don't tell him we're making penis.

1314
05:00:28,659 --> 05:00:32,099
Somebody just leaned in really close. Clicked on the penis button. Went

1315
05:00:35,290 --> 05:00:39,159
right into this screen. All right. Doctor's lab. Let's go.

1316
05:00:45,669 --> 05:01:02,330
Doctor's lab. This is going to be Doctor Mario. Yeah it's Doctor. Even the, that's a total.

1317
05:01:03,130 --> 05:01:17,400
How does Nintendo get away with that? That's very clearly the guy from Doctor Mario. Use

1318
05:01:17,400 --> 05:01:28,020
system memory. Funny story. I don't even know how to play Doctor Mario. I have no idea.

1319
05:01:34,659 --> 05:01:44,439
Doctor Smith. My laboratory got attacked by malicious viruses. I have no idea how to do

1320
05:01:44,439 --> 05:01:52,340
this. Does it sound like we connect the two? We have to connect red to red right? Like jump

1321
05:01:52,340 --> 05:02:03,830
in a car. Dude this is just Doctor Mario. This is Doctor Mario. That's just Mario when he's

1322
05:02:03,830 --> 05:02:10,259
60. 70. Mario is supposed to be like 70 isn't he? Fuck. It's hard to control.

1323
05:02:10,259 --> 05:03:01,049
You gotta give them credit though. They just don't give a shit if they get sued.

1324
05:03:02,069 --> 05:03:10,889
Why would it ever happen? Do you think it would ever happen? I'm not sure it would.

1325
05:03:14,759 --> 05:03:35,580
Oh just put whatever song you. I can't. I'm trying. It's hard to control. Up is the only

1326
05:03:35,580 --> 05:03:45,080
thing that changes it. That's going to be something. There it is. Oh it's so hard. You

1327
05:03:45,080 --> 05:03:55,799
don't understand. It's like this input lag trying to move these. Trust me. Oh my god.

1328
05:03:55,799 --> 05:04:18,360
I pressed it twice. Oh I feel like I'm playing this underwater. Come on queue it up.

1329
05:04:20,900 --> 05:04:54,389
Oh my god it's. There was like a half. There was at least a half second delay when I pressed a

1330
05:04:54,389 --> 05:05:12,360
button. At least. Had to have been. Uh Pharaoh's Challenge. No. People have decided to change

1331
05:05:12,360 --> 05:05:21,159
their minds. The band's gonna sue me. They're not gonna sue me. They're gonna sue.

1332
05:05:21,959 --> 05:05:32,599
I don't even know what company this is. When will we play the 700,000th game?

1333
05:05:33,319 --> 05:05:44,229
Stop. Don't. Stop linking this flap. It reminds me every time and it brings me back there.

1334
05:05:46,709 --> 05:05:53,110
That's the. That's. That's. You know what that is? That's 2019 Snort. That's definitely

1335
05:05:53,110 --> 05:06:03,939
what that is and it's way worse. I am going to click on clips for the next year. It's

1336
05:06:03,939 --> 05:06:07,139
gonna be like hey dude I saw this uh funny clip that you should check out. It's gonna

1337
05:06:07,139 --> 05:06:18,380
be this lap. Just. Just replace it. Snort. Replace it. All right we're going to

1338
05:06:18,459 --> 05:06:31,270
Atom Bomber. Atom Bomber. Thank you for voting. I really appreciate it. Atom Bomber doesn't work.

1339
05:06:31,270 --> 05:06:51,930
Thank you for voting. Appreciate it. It's a good attempt. Sorry guys. Where you want to go now?

1340
05:06:51,930 --> 05:07:01,540
Pharaoh's Challenge. That's what it looks like. Book of Thanos. Don't eat fish. It's toxic.

1341
05:07:06,950 --> 05:07:15,369
What are you talking about? That just. Somebody just bursted through the door and just

1342
05:07:15,369 --> 05:07:42,650
screamed. Don't eat it. Uh Book of Thanos has one. Let's head there. Book Tales. Okay.

1343
05:07:45,020 --> 05:07:53,430
Fun day today. Does it open? Nope. Sorry it doesn't open. Yes it does. Yes it does.

1344
05:07:54,459 --> 05:08:04,659

More eye candies. I guess I'm going to keep them on fairy tale. Modest creators. That's

1364
05:15:13,639 --> 05:15:21,299
question. How do you vote? Just click the screen. As long as you have the extension enabled.

1365
05:15:21,299 --> 05:15:25,220
It should be enabled by default right? Unless you have to press a button. You might have to

1366
05:15:25,220 --> 05:15:36,040
enable the extension. Everybody says play bookworm adventures. Well I already I just did.

1367
05:15:36,040 --> 05:15:48,729
All right. Pharaoh's Challenge. Touch my monitor. Why? Pharaoh's Challenge.

1368
05:15:53,979 --> 05:16:07,419
Now where? Pharaoh's Challenge. We want tennis. I can't get it to work. Tennis Championship

1372
05:17:17,110 --> 05:17:25,240
play tennis. You're right. Classic mode. Let's go. I already did this one. I don't know what

1373
05:17:25,240 --> 05:17:54,150
any of this means. Oh this is fucking fun. Do combos. Let's get a five combo. Check this out.

1374
05:17:55,110 --> 05:18:04,389
All going this way. Oh my god. I'm gonna fucking scream here. This is gonna be insane. It's gonna

1375
05:18:04,389 --> 05:18:43,060
be insane. Pharaoh's Challenge. And let's try tennis one more time because I have direct play

1376
05:18:43,060 --> 05:18:49,430
now. Touch the monitor. What what are you talking about? What are you talking about?

1377
05:18:50,229 --> 05:19:14,220
What are you guys even talking about? I can't. It's gonna. It's another one of these stupid

1378
05:19:14,220 --> 05:19:22,919
things. I'm stuck here. All right. Let's go to career. I need. Can you guys see it?

1379
05:19:23,479 --> 05:19:45,029
I have to make it larger. Somewhere on earth is it go. Why are you going up there?

1380
05:19:45,909 --> 05:19:58,139
Why would it go up there? Let's see if I bring it down. What it does this time.

1381
05:19:59,500 --> 05:20:06,040
This is Hotline Miami 2 music. Oh that's as good. That's as good as it's gonna get.

1382
05:20:10,500 --> 05:20:18,779
Timmy. Male be human. You can be what other species? Gonna be like a dog?

1383
05:20:20,220 --> 05:20:46,119
Why would they be something else besides humans? I don't know how to play. Shift.

1384
05:20:46,119 --> 05:21:04,409
Alt. Control. Z. X. A. C. B. Space. Space. Cursor up. No. What the fuck is going on?

1385
05:21:09,740 --> 05:22:06,419
Oh no. Up. I have to make it random shit. I'm fucking so mad. I don't know what it is about

1386
05:22:06,419 --> 05:22:13,990
tennis. Tennis just fucking enrages me. It makes me so angry. I don't know what it is about

1387
05:22:13,990 --> 05:22:47,580
it. Got it. Look at how long that hair is. I didn't hit that. Oh my god. Fucking tennis.

1388
05:22:48,060 --> 05:23:20,659
Oops. Say the line. Oh I can't do it until I serve. Who coughed? How come she doesn't even need

1389
05:23:20,659 --> 05:23:25,580
to move? This is not fair. Everything I do goes right in the middle. She doesn't have to move.

1390
05:23:26,139 --> 05:23:38,360
I have to move. I keep hitting it to her. How am I supposed to not hit it?

1391
05:23:39,799 --> 05:23:45,500
I'm hitting it straight in the middle. All right listen.

1392
05:23:47,099 --> 05:23:52,380
There is no way that I'm going to be told I'm doing something wrong in a serial box tennis

1393
05:23:52,380 --> 05:24:07,290
game. And here we go. Big. And here we go. Big head tennis. This is what you came for.

1394
05:24:07,290 --> 05:24:17,819
It's not going to work. Big head tennis. This is what you came for ladies and gentlemen.

1395
05:24:17,819 --> 05:24:31,669
Big head tennis. See. I did it. I did the line. You cannot stop booing me. There's only space.

1396
05:24:38,759 --> 05:25:04,090
I can't aim where this even serves to. It just goes right to her. You're so bad.

1397
05:25:05,049 --> 05:25:17,080
You can't. You can't. You can't be bad at tennis championship on 700,000 games.

1398
05:25:17,880 --> 05:25:24,040
It's not possible. There's one action. There's swing and there's walk through mud.

1399
05:25:25,560 --> 05:25:30,919
There's no such thing as being bad at a game like I just splashed liquid on my face.

1400
05:25:32,779 --> 05:25:39,700
You suck at tennis. I'll see me in real tennis. I just fucking kick back

1401
05:25:40,419 --> 05:25:46,380
and smash it as hard as I can. It just goes soaring over everybody.

1402
05:25:46,380 --> 05:25:50,060
You know they properly throw it and it's just fucking I just hit it as hard as I can

1403
05:25:50,060 --> 05:25:56,520
trying to hit it like out of the ballpark. You're gonna be like everybody fucking gasps.

1404
05:25:57,240 --> 05:26:21,979
Touch your screen please. Oh my god. Why did I do that? I get it. Come on do it for me.

1405
05:26:22,619 --> 05:26:29,720
I know you guys are capable of doing this. So are you are you capable of this?

1406
05:26:30,360 --> 05:26:55,419
You guys are not even capable. Really? You're supposed to be touching when I touch so it looks

1407
05:26:55,419 --> 05:27:27,799
cool. I'll give you one more chance. I'm done with it. I'm done with it. This is too much

1408
05:27:27,799 --> 05:27:36,729
of a delay. It's like a four second delay. There was a 55% click on my mouth so you can't

1409
05:27:36,729 --> 05:27:41,419
come on. You can't tell me that I'm bad at tennis when it came from this game.

1410
05:27:54,279 --> 05:28:02,340
We're going to space something. Space crusaders. How long is this stream? This is almost five and

1411
05:28:02,340 --> 05:28:12,950
a half hours. Oh my god. At least we can say we did this. I've been watching all night for this.

1412
05:28:12,950 --> 05:28:19,450
Well I hope it turns on because it might not even work. I hope it works too for your sake.

1413
05:28:19,450 --> 05:29:18,330
I really do. I'm so sorry. What's even left? One two three four five six seven eight nine

1414
05:29:19,159 --> 05:29:22,919
ten eleven twelve. We've got about 30% left. Twenty five. Maybe like another hour or so.

1415
05:29:36,709 --> 05:29:45,779
So it looks as a foosball champ. There's 3D in this one running in compatibility mode.

1416
05:29:45,779 --> 05:29:51,770
The whole thing is set for compatibility mode for Windows 7. That's what is recommended.

1417
05:29:54,650 --> 05:30:04,040
The whole thing is in compatibility mode already and as administrator. All right.

1418
05:30:04,040 --> 05:30:12,360
Foosball 3D. 3D in the title and there is 3D in the title therefore

1419
05:30:14,229 --> 05:30:47,130
Foosball Champion does not open. Wait a goddamn second. Wait a second. I need to find out this

1420
05:30:47,130 --> 05:31:04,180
once and for all. Hold on. So this is this is game pack volume five and six. Five and six.

1421
05:31:05,060 --> 05:31:15,689
And that game was called Foosball Champion 3D. It's in here. So what the hell? I thought

1422
05:31:15,689 --> 05:31:25,240
it was gonna be an empty folder. Dest was making sure it was an empty door. The door is yeah the

1423
05:31:25,240 --> 05:31:41,619
door is moving. No it's not an empty folder. It just doesn't work. Let's not try again. Foosball

1424
05:31:41,619 --> 05:32:00,630
3D. Little Herder will work. The closet. What the fuck? I don't even know what the fuck you

1425
05:32:00,630 --> 05:32:20,490
guys are talking about. It's close. This is actually really close. We'll have to see. 24.

1426
05:32:20,490 --> 05:33:18,360
Wow that's this close. I can't stop it yet. Damn. 31 to 35. Little Herder. All right looks

1427
05:33:18,360 --> 05:33:38,340
like Bob. Bob is the winner. Let's take a look. Thanks for voting everybody. Which one was it?

1428
05:33:38,340 --> 05:33:56,650
Heli Quick Bob. Heli Quick Bob. Let's see. Open. Does it work? We're getting so unlucky

1429
05:33:56,650 --> 05:34:19,689
in a row. It doesn't work. Helicopter Bob doesn't work. How? Why? Look at how cool this

1430
05:34:19,689 --> 05:34:29,080
one looks too. Look it starts to open and then it just damn it. Hold on. Let me go.

1431
05:34:34,740 --> 05:34:41,159
We're getting kind of. We're striking out here. Seriously. Let me try a couple things

1432
05:34:41,159 --> 05:34:53,180
here because I want to see these. A load of bullshit. Volume 8. What was it called?

1433
05:34:53,819 --> 05:35:10,310
Bob? Something with a bob? Heli Quick Bob. Yeah it's in here. Let's try it running it

1434
05:35:10,310 --> 05:35:24,900
directly from in here. Yeah run it. Is it going to work? Sorry guys. I'm running as

1435
05:35:24,900 --> 05:35:33,400
administrator compatibility mode. It just isn't going to work. That's unfortunate.

1436
05:35:33,959 --> 05:35:41,380
Let me get that back on the screen. Try again. We're eliminating a lot of these.

1437
05:35:43,220 --> 05:35:59,099
Where the hell is it? 8 right? It's down here. Heli Quick Bob is dead. Take a guess again.

1438
05:36:10,729 --> 05:36:25,270
Where are you going here? Down lower left. Seems like it. So 4 up. It's just going to be

1439
05:36:25,270 --> 05:36:36,229
Connect 4. You want to play Connect 4? We can play Connect 4. If it opens. And it is. It

1440
05:36:36,229 --> 05:36:53,240
finally fucking opened. 4 up. This one can be changed because that looks fine. Let me zoom

1441
05:36:53,240 --> 05:37:00,700
in a little bit. You haven't played? This won't take very long. Alright let's go. So game.

1442
05:37:02,020 --> 05:37:15,930
New game. Or game settings. View. No. New game. Human versus human. Alright I'll go first.

1443
05:37:16,729 --> 05:37:48,950
Your turn. I think I'm going here. Uh maybe not. 34. Oh it took it over right now. That's

1444
05:37:48,950 --> 05:38:15,479
it. That's it? No? What the fuck? Hold on. Hold on. The vote got skewed. Try it again. Go.

1445
05:38:15,479 --> 05:38:27,270
Enhance. Enhance. Alright hold on let me enhance. Yeah that's enhanced. Let's do it again. Enhanced.

1446
05:38:34,790 --> 05:38:47,770
Come on. My grandmother's faster than you guys. My grandmother's even faster than you. Uh that

1447
05:38:47,770 --> 05:39:01,500
didn't help. That made it worse somehow. Did that? What are you trying to click on over here?

1448
05:39:02,389 --> 05:39:09,299
I need to enhance it more. Well that's where you guys are trying to go I think. Now where?

1449
05:39:09,299 --> 05:39:38,040
Okay. 47% down here. You got it? Alright I think I'm gonna go here. What about you guys?

1450
05:39:38,040 --> 05:40:00,549
Where are you going now? Okay. Right here. Sounds good. Well um sorry I'm gonna have to

1451
05:40:00,549 --> 05:40:13,110
block you there. So you thought I was gonna let you just do that in a row. Right there.

1452
05:40:15,369 --> 05:40:43,459
You got it. Okay. My turn? Where are you guys going? Okay. Here? Here? This one here? 33%?

1453
05:40:43,459 --> 05:41:00,759
Got it. I mean it's a majority. Almost. 35. I'm gonna go over here. Okay. Alright. That works.

1454
05:41:00,759 --> 05:41:15,220
That works for me. Alright. Where are you guys going? Here or here? Which one? Here?

1455
05:41:15,220 --> 05:41:24,090
Or down here? This one? 11%? That's a little bit. That's a lot. Here or down here?

1456
05:41:24,729 --> 05:41:37,180
Well maybe like over here? Some people look like enough here. Okay. Fine. Oh where do I go from

1457
05:41:37,180 --> 05:41:42,779
here? Oh hmm hmm hmm. Right here. Looks good to me. Where are you guys going? Down here?

1458
05:41:45,319 --> 05:41:57,939
Over this way I think. Maybe like down this way or this way. I've never seen

1459
05:41:59,240 --> 05:42:22,139
a consensus like this and it broke. I just had to say it. You guys might have a good play

1460
05:42:22,220 --> 05:42:29,860
down here if you get a couple down here. Because like I'm going diagonal here so you

1461
05:42:29,860 --> 05:42:43,259
can get a block right here. Hmm. Let me see where I'm at here.

1462
05:42:45,419 --> 05:43:12,009
Right into my twap. Where are you guys going? Right here? Oh that's a good play.

1463
05:43:17,110 --> 05:43:44,900
Like oh I get this. I get it. Where you off to? We chat is in trouble. I've got three

1464
05:43:44,900 --> 05:43:51,080
separated plays that nobody knows about except for me. And now it seems like you're

1465
05:43:51,080 --> 05:43:54,680
splendoring a little here. You don't know. Should we go up here? Down here?

1466
05:43:56,040 --> 05:43:59,560
Jebaited! Right? Oh no. The one where he holds his head. Feels like this.

1467
05:43:59,560 --> 05:44:13,720
Feels failfish. Feels bad. No. Not like this. Okay. Really not like to be in the

1468
05:44:13,720 --> 05:44:20,599
position that you guys are in now. No I would not. Because now you have to. You have to

1469
05:44:20,599 --> 05:44:27,180
start to worry about the win that I have here. Now you have to worry about it. And I've got

1470
05:44:27,180 --> 05:44:50,169
three victories. You sure? Three lined up victories. Oh boy is this gonna be bad.

1471
05:44:52,729 --> 05:45:22,220
Seriously. I mean the look on your face. The look on all of our 4500 faces.

1472
05:45:26,259 --> 05:45:35,909
Ah look at how spread out it is over here. Look at all these places I can go.

1473
05:45:36,630 --> 05:45:40,840
I've got so many. Just depends on which one I'd like to go to.

1474
05:45:48,020 --> 05:46:04,099
This way? This way? Right in the middle here. Oof. Oof. Oof. That's an oof. Okay.

1475
05:46:13,900 --> 05:46:24,409
Well. Well. Look at that. You would just love to have that wouldn't you?

1476
05:46:24,409 --> 05:46:27,770
You'd just love to have one of these. One of those. Right here.

1477
05:46:30,580 --> 05:46:34,060
Yeah. You would. You would like that I think.

1478
05:46:34,619 --> 05:47:01,099
I don't know.

1479
05:47:04,549 --> 05:47:24,139
I love this. 17 percent. Traitors. Traitor.

1480
05:47:32,819 --> 05:48:06,680
Okay. This is. This is. There's a decent play over here for you guys if you can come up.

1481
05:48:24,970 --> 05:48:33,209
All right. I wonder. I wonder what I'm gonna do.

1482
05:48:34,630 --> 05:49:17,619
83 percent. Mercy kill. Mercy kill. That's not four in a row guys.

1483
05:49:17,619 --> 05:49:55,419
Do you surrender? No surrender? Never. Okay. Never surrender. All right fine. You sure?

1484
05:49:55,419 --> 05:50:19,209
I mean I could if you wanted to. Eddie you want to go here? Oh boy.

1485
05:50:19,209 --> 05:50:24,229
That's actually a pretty smart play. You should do it. Please go there.

1486
05:50:24,229 --> 05:50:27,540
Absolutely click that. Do not change your mind. Click right there.

1487
05:50:34,569 --> 05:51:35,080
I'm trying to help a little bit. Four up. What are you gonna do? Okay.

1488
05:51:35,080 --> 05:51:54,169
That's it. Congratulations chat. You lost.

1489
05:51:54,169 --> 05:52:08,439
I would play the rest of this out but is it even really worth it? Should I?

1490
05:52:09,319 --> 05:53:20,119
Okay. That was fun to play together.

1491
05:53:20,119 --> 05:53:42,740
This is a draw. Rematch? Okay fine. One rematch and that's it. I'll go first.

1492
05:53:44,759 --> 05:53:52,099
Say how would you save changes to that? Go for it. No. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Stop.

1493
05:53:52,099 --> 05:54:26,340
Okay. In the middle. 62 percent. 49. 40 percent. 49 percent. Okay.

1494
05:54:37,299 --> 05:54:40,979
Is chat getting too caught up drawing a dick on the screen that I'm just gonna win in four

1495
05:54:40,979 --> 05:55:34,860
moves? You can't just click no mercy. Okay. Good luck. Are you gonna draw your dick to

1496
05:55:34,860 --> 05:56:13,639
victory? Is that what this is? That's not even I don't think that's possible. Right here. 47.

1497
05:56:13,639 --> 05:56:21,619
What do you say? Okay. Yeah that works for me. No that's good. Good call.

1498
05:56:33,020 --> 05:56:37,580
No that's not rigged. That's not rigged. I would I was in the middle of saying that's good for me

1499
05:56:37,580 --> 05:56:46,180
and all of a sudden everybody changes their votes. It was 44 to 39 and I was like all right and

1500
05:56:46,180 --> 05:56:56,779
then it was like wait no hold on and everybody clicked on over here. Didn't wait long enough.

1501
05:56:56,779 --> 05:57:13,020
I waited plenty. That was as long as I waited the last 10 turns. That what? Pull it back.

1502
05:57:13,020 --> 05:57:26,500
Let's run it back. Let's see it. Well yeah but you just wanted to win. No it's not the

1503
05:57:26,500 --> 05:57:33,240
case. But let's pick another game because we got to move through this shit. That one isn't

1504
05:57:33,240 --> 05:57:37,880
canon okay. We'll count the first one as canon. We tied. It was a tie game between the two of us.

1505
05:57:38,900 --> 05:57:52,169
Between the one and 4500 of us. What the hell was that game called? Checkers? Connect 4?

1506
05:57:52,169 --> 05:58:02,439
I have no idea what the hell that was. Four up. Right over here right? Right there.

1507
05:58:02,439 --> 05:58:03,240
All right where we going?

1508
05:58:13,029 --> 05:58:16,389
Everyone's linking. Oh why is everyone spam linking this?

1509
05:58:26,040 --> 05:58:32,200
Oh it's the god. It makes it so bad because we need to watch this because this is very

1510
05:58:32,200 --> 05:58:40,650
important. The the slap in the game makes this fucking so brutal. Do you understand?

1511
05:58:43,060 --> 05:58:56,459
The slap in the in the game. I timed it perfectly. Why am I linking this? You've already seen it.

1512
05:58:59,130 --> 05:59:06,279
That that is. Oh my. Yeah it was real. I accidentally did it but this game sound

1513
05:59:07,319 --> 05:59:16,090
made that so much worse. That wasn't as loud as that actually was. That looks like I fucking

1514
05:59:16,090 --> 05:59:31,900
crushed myself. All right where we going? Did it hurt? No because I didn't. I'm not playing.

1515
05:59:32,540 --> 05:59:57,659
Connect up again. I'm not. No. Let's. Okay the clip of me cheating. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

1516
05:59:57,659 --> 06:00:01,099
I want to get this on stream so we can have a documented evidence of what happened.

1517
06:00:02,759 --> 06:00:25,930
Documented proof. One second. We can watch this right now. Look at that. 40. Do you see?

1518
06:00:25,930 --> 06:00:39,209
44. Right when I click it. Look take take a look again. Slow it down. Look at this. 43 to 39.

1519
06:00:40,009 --> 06:00:51,720
You can hear the click. Listen for it. See? I clicked it right here. Right there. Listen.

1520
06:00:51,720 --> 06:01:06,340
Are you listening? See? You guys didn't make up your mind fast enough. There wasn't there was

1521
06:01:06,340 --> 06:01:24,259
not a consensus. Bang. You can't call me out on that one. You weren't quick enough.

1522
06:01:25,060 --> 06:01:44,009
44, 42, 44, 39. Bang. There it is. I mean what more can I say? That's how the cards fell.

1523
06:02:15,529 --> 06:02:25,689
So many games left. And we're getting late too. It's been six hours. All right. If even one

1524
06:02:25,689 --> 06:02:39,740
percent click on something else. I'm gonna count it. You understand? That's unbelievable.

1525
06:02:40,380 --> 06:02:45,819
I'm gonna let. Okay I'm gonna grab uh I'm gonna grab another soda. I'm. Someone's gonna

1526
06:02:45,819 --> 06:02:56,500
click. I know they will. See? See? See? I told you. See? We got like blaster balls in space. We've

1527
06:02:56,500 --> 06:03:07,720
got fun maze traitors. I mean you got a significant portion of traitors it seems.

1528
06:03:13,029 --> 06:03:16,549
All right. I really am gonna grab another drink. I'll be right back. Probably the last

1529
06:03:16,549 --> 06:03:22,900
break of the night. And we will clock out the rest of these. Probably another another couple

1530
06:03:22,900 --> 06:03:27,220
hours maybe. Maybe like an hour hour or two. Who knows? We're just gonna go. I'm having

1531
06:03:27,220 --> 06:03:40,490
fun. You having fun? You having a good time? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. No. Because you cheated. No.

1532
06:03:40,490 --> 06:03:55,590
You cheater. I'll be right back. I'm not. You think I'm gonna leave without turning that off?

1533
06:03:56,150 --> 06:07:04,229
This is the chat that cried wolf. I'll be right back. So I just tried to explain to

1534
06:07:04,229 --> 06:07:08,220
the people downstairs that I hit myself. That I slapped myself in the face.

1535
06:07:09,860 --> 06:07:13,459
And I just got. They couldn't even understand how it was possible.

1536
06:07:14,259 --> 06:07:22,740
Ah. Was I on purpose? No, no, no. Were you drinking? No, I wasn't drinking.

1537
06:07:24,700 --> 06:07:37,900
It ain't AC being green. As Kermit the fucking frog once said. All right. Uh so what have we

1538
06:07:37,900 --> 06:08:32,900
decided to do? Chat. What are we doing? Well. You guys just made like a squished dick.

1539
06:08:33,939 --> 06:08:51,619
Why am I talking? Stop talking. This never would have happened if we didn't have to come

1540
06:08:51,619 --> 06:09:02,200
back into this game. I'll take that vote kick. Kick me. Get me out of here. I'm gonna give a lot

1541
06:09:02,200 --> 06:09:23,099
of time for you guys. More than 10 seconds. It was like 25 seconds. You can't tell me that

1542
06:09:23,099 --> 06:09:41,849
it wasn't. Where are you off to? I'm gonna hold on for like 10. I'm gonna do 10 seconds.

1543
06:09:49,189 --> 06:10:14,970
Okay. That's pretty. That's unanimous. Do a bad impression and the vote kicks increase.

1544
06:10:14,970 --> 06:10:20,340
Look at how torn this chat is now. You can't blame it on time this time guys.

1545
06:10:21,860 --> 06:11:03,700
You gotta blame it on the from the 20th. Blame falls here because eeeeek. Okay. Have a nice day.

1546
06:11:03,700 --> 06:11:39,590
Trying to build up right. I can see right through you. That's unanimous. I've had to sneeze

1547
06:11:39,590 --> 06:11:59,419
for six hours and it just won't fucking happen. This is horrible. Slap yourself. Why? Why does

1548
06:11:59,419 --> 06:12:12,150
this have to be happening? GG idiot. What do you mean GG idiot? You haven't won yet.

1549
06:12:12,150 --> 06:12:40,169
GG. GG idiot. You haven't won. The game still goes. Okay. Uh. Hmm. Can't go this way.

1550
06:12:40,729 --> 06:12:53,799
Can't really go that way. So I guess I'm gonna go this way. You're fucked now. Yellow well.

1551
06:13:02,950 --> 06:13:14,790
Go for the bottom. Go for the top. Go for it. Connect four. All the way over here. Seems

1552
06:13:14,790 --> 06:13:48,380
like that's what's gonna happen. Good luck with that. Good luck. 100%

1553
06:14:08,650 --> 06:14:23,319
GG idiot. GG idiot. Right here. Which which one? I want to get this right so I don't have to

1554
06:14:23,319 --> 06:14:53,340
fucking play connect four again. This looks like it's going over here. Do a recount? What

1555
06:14:53,340 --> 06:15:00,979
do you mean a recount? I don't get a recount. Let's refresh it. Fine. You get you get you

1556
06:15:00,979 --> 06:15:10,549
one phone a friend here. What are you guys doing? Why is it so? What is the consensus

1557
06:15:10,549 --> 06:15:35,400
here? Do I have to zoom in? I think this is 40 40. This is 41%. 41%. I don't know what this is.

1558
06:15:38,069 --> 06:15:47,209
That it's it's right here. No it's definitely this one. This is it's probably like 40

1559
06:15:47,209 --> 06:15:55,900
something 30 something here. All right. Last recount here. If you want it in this slot

1560
06:15:55,900 --> 06:16:01,349
click over here. If you want it in this slot click over here. You understand? Action.

1561
06:16:06,169 --> 06:16:16,220
What is going on? All right. Okay. Hold on. Wait a minute. What? This is correct. This is correct.

1562
06:16:16,220 --> 06:16:43,450
What's going on in the middle? It's definitely left. That's 40%. It's the left one. GG idiot.

1563
06:16:44,009 --> 06:18:21,700
Shit. I'm a dog sleeping. 100. Whoa. Stop stop stop. What? I can't believe there's 100

1564
06:18:21,700 --> 06:19:07,029
going this way. 100. Cut that one off while we can. We have all the winning moves. Idiot.

1565
06:19:07,029 --> 06:20:34,950
Yeah. Oh, what's that? Look at me. All right. I'm going to wait here. I'm going to give you the

1566
06:20:34,950 --> 06:20:55,400
time to figure it out. I am going to put my hands up. That's 10 seconds. That's it. I

1567
06:20:55,400 --> 06:21:11,479
can't let you guys think about it that much. That's it. That's 10%. What are you going to

1568
06:21:11,479 --> 06:21:49,209
do now? You want to go here? Wow. Are you sure? I can't believe you guys want to go there.

1569
06:21:51,450 --> 06:22:41,159
Are you done? Are you done now? Can we move on? No. Why would I do that? Again,

1570
06:22:41,159 --> 06:22:51,299
we already did it. I'm going to pick one at random. Play the Vincent Price laugh for us.

1571
06:22:51,299 --> 06:23:02,419
No. Will you pick something? We've been here for six and a half hours, guys.

1572
06:23:03,799 --> 06:23:11,560
Pick something else. There's not much more. There's only like 15 more video games to try.

1573
06:23:17,770 --> 06:23:27,319
I'm going to do it again. No, I want to win. Well, that's too bad. We're going to play

1574
06:23:27,319 --> 06:23:33,349
the cat in the maze. Good choice. See, there you go. You guys get to have your win.

1575
06:23:34,220 --> 06:23:38,299
I beat you last time. I beat, first of all, beat you guys. The first time we played

1576
06:23:38,299 --> 06:23:43,700
checkers beat you guys in chess, checkmated you guys in about three seconds.

1577
06:23:46,680 --> 06:23:52,360
We're tied right now. Checkers rematch. No, no, no. Why would I do that? You win,

1578
06:23:52,360 --> 06:24:00,549
you go out. All right. So we're going to do a cat maze. What the hell was this thing

1579
06:24:00,549 --> 06:24:14,009
called? Aqua boat maze. Chess rematch or riot. Aqua boat maze does not work. Oh, yes.

1580
06:24:19,509 --> 06:24:30,500
Oh, whoops. Actually, that's kind of good because I can do this. How's the hair?

1581
06:24:30,500 --> 06:24:56,119
Not bad. Aqua boat maze from Parker Brothers. Press any key. Where's any key, March?

1582
06:24:56,759 --> 06:25:45,159
I don't know. A lot of information. Anchor slows monster down. Extra life gives you

1583
06:25:45,159 --> 06:25:50,069
temporary invulnerability. You can eat monsters with the ring, Louis. Collect the dots.

1584
06:25:50,069 --> 06:26:01,240
This is just Pac-Man. Yes, it is. And there's a Lego guy here. Oh, you guys want me to play

1585
06:26:01,240 --> 06:26:16,340
Lego Island? Well, this is kind of it, isn't it? There's no island. I mean, there technically

1586
06:26:16,340 --> 06:26:38,419
is an island. It's me. And objects surrounded by a body of water is an island. We thought

1587
06:26:38,419 --> 06:27:02,009
I was going to lose. God, Legos are so much fun. GG, idiot squids. I got to beat the first

1588
06:27:02,009 --> 06:27:08,340
level. What's this one? This one does something to monsters. Slows them down. Well, good. I'll

1589
06:27:08,340 --> 06:27:15,849
eat them both. Get it. Nice. This game is terrible, but I'm going to complete the first

1590
06:27:15,849 --> 06:27:29,900
level. It's just Pac-Man again. Yeah, that's unfortunate. I ate his bones and he died.

1591
06:27:32,229 --> 06:27:44,360
Odd. Two, three, four. Done. Press any key. That's one. That one's done. No one wants

1592
06:27:44,360 --> 06:27:47,720
to me to sit there and play that for like another five minutes. I don't think one person

1593
06:27:47,720 --> 06:28:20,569
does. One person. You're right. There is always one guy. That's true. Well, the 35% on Connect

1594
06:28:20,569 --> 06:28:24,970
Up is being deleted, so we're going to go with the next highest one. It is books and

1595
06:28:25,930 --> 06:28:44,099
beaks in space. Books lost in space. Where is it? Break ball lost in space. No, I'm

1596
06:28:44,099 --> 06:28:50,520
not going to play checkers for an hour and a half with chat. We've got 700,000 games to

1597
06:28:50,520 --> 06:29:06,580
get through. This one's going to be a disaster. I'm going to do this one really quick. This

1598
06:29:06,580 --> 06:29:43,659
one. Here we go. Okay. Cool. I can't see. I can't see. What do I get? What do I

1599
06:29:43,659 --> 06:31:01,500
get? Can you guys see what's going on? Got it. I think we hard pass the ones that

1600
06:31:01,580 --> 06:31:34,729
cannot be opened correctly. You know what I'm saying? It's 40% of these. Yeah, guess what?

1601
06:31:34,729 --> 06:31:48,979
And 40% of your votes aren't counted because of this. Oh, bowling. I know it says bowling.

1602
06:31:48,979 --> 06:32:00,330
Cosmo Alley Bowling. Let's hope this one works. Undemocratic. Well, come on. Cosmo

1603
06:32:00,330 --> 06:32:51,000
Alley Bowling. I played this one. Did it open on your computer? That's a start. Run

1604
06:32:51,000 --> 06:32:58,819
as admin. I did. I've done it on a bunch of them already. I'll try this one. This whole

1605
06:32:58,819 --> 06:33:04,740
thing right now is open in Windows 7 compatibility, which it's supposed to be and in administrator

1606
06:33:04,740 --> 06:33:08,180
mode. I've tried to open them from their own respective folders in administrative mode

1607
06:33:08,180 --> 06:33:14,700
and it doesn't do anything. I will try this one more time. See if we can get it to work.

1608
06:33:14,700 --> 06:33:26,250
It's just a whole lot of bullshit. If you ask me. That one was called Cosmo Alley Bowling.

1609
06:33:28,709 --> 06:33:34,340
There it is. Properties. We got to make sure it is compatible. Compatibility. Yes.

1610
06:33:35,139 --> 06:33:44,439
And it's as administrator. Try it again. It is, right? Okay. Come on.

1611
06:33:48,259 --> 06:33:55,740
Jerma sounds fed up. I just can't believe they released a second one of these.

1612
06:33:56,299 --> 06:34:12,459
And it didn't work. The arrogance on releasing a second one. The

1613
06:34:12,459 --> 06:34:33,430
insolence. The arrogance of doing a version two. You don't know how scams work. Hold on.

1614
06:34:35,529 --> 06:35:02,819
What company is this? What else have they done? This is Viva Media. Wild Tangent. What? No,

1615
06:35:02,819 --> 06:35:27,669
it's not. What else have they made? Where have I heard this name before? I swear to God,

1616
06:35:27,669 --> 06:35:48,470
I've heard this name somewhere. Oh my God. Stalker. Call of Pripyat. Are you kidding me?

1617
06:35:48,470 --> 06:35:57,909
I knew I heard this name of this company before. No way. Who made it? No, that's not the same

1618
06:35:57,909 --> 06:36:18,040
company. That's GSC Game World. Why would Viva Media be connected to Stalker? Hold on. Viva

1619
06:36:18,040 --> 06:36:26,060
Media Games. Take a look at what pops up in the first thing. Strange. Maybe there's like

1620
06:36:26,060 --> 06:36:39,529
a weird keyword in there. It's a publisher. The conspiracy deepens. What the fuck are you

1621
06:36:39,529 --> 06:36:53,560
guys doing? No, no, no, no. Don't do that. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, I'm not going to condone

1622
06:36:53,560 --> 06:37:02,860
that. I'm not going to condone that kind of behavior. No, I'm not even going to say it

1623
06:37:02,860 --> 06:37:06,700
because I don't even want to give it attention. I don't want to condone that behavior. So I'm

1624
06:37:06,700 --> 06:37:20,470
not going to give it attention. Nope. No. No. Pick the next game. What is this

1625
06:37:20,470 --> 06:37:24,619
coffee pasta here? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I need to fucking, I need to,

1626
06:37:24,619 --> 06:37:27,900
I gotta paste this on the screen because I, hold on, that went by too fast.

1627
06:37:58,299 --> 06:38:01,740
Users have complained that the company's products have an adverse effect on their PC's

1628
06:38:01,740 --> 06:38:07,180
performance or are intrusive to the user's experience. PC Magazine wrote in 2004 that

1629
06:38:07,180 --> 06:38:11,419
although the program is not very evil, some privacy complaints were justified as the

1630
06:38:11,419 --> 06:38:17,020
program's user manual states that it may collect name, address, phone number, email,

1631
06:38:17,020 --> 06:38:21,180
and other contact information and could distribute the collected information with the

1632
06:38:21,180 --> 06:38:37,369
user's consent. Where did you get this from? Did one guy make this up? I think one guy may

1633
06:38:37,369 --> 06:38:50,169
have made this up. No. Did one guy make this fucking story up? And I gave it administrator.

1634
06:39:12,150 --> 06:39:15,479
You know what I think is a great title? I think it's a fun

1635
06:39:16,119 --> 06:39:26,340
series of games. 700,000 games is a fun thing. It's fun. I think I just want to make sure

1636
06:39:27,299 --> 06:39:32,900
that, oh my God, there's no, what do I, okay, time to play fucking, oh well, we're in too

1637
06:39:32,900 --> 06:39:50,919
deep already. Let's fucking keep going. Somebody wrote, it's not fun. Why bother?

1638
06:39:51,720 --> 06:39:57,689
But that may have just been a jokey copy pasta. I don't want to like say that that's,

1639
06:39:57,689 --> 06:40:01,770
I just want to make sure we're clear. That could just be like a gotcha streamer moment

1640
06:40:01,770 --> 06:40:05,610
and whatever. I'm going to just say it is because I don't want to fucking think that

1641
06:40:05,689 --> 06:40:28,169
that happened. What? It's, I'm never going to be able to look at this and knock, oh my God.

1642
06:40:29,909 --> 06:40:34,549
No, but this isn't wild tangent though. This is, the company name was just listed there.

1643
06:40:40,459 --> 06:40:46,299
I'm not going to fucking play. Connect four again. Okay. You have to pick something else.

1644
06:40:48,500 --> 06:40:51,860
That's a wild tangent Wikipedia. That's not even the same company.

1645
06:41:02,900 --> 06:41:16,599
Can one person collect something else? They know your garage door password.

1646
06:41:19,900 --> 06:41:28,060
Is nobody clicking? Am I, is my click fucked up?

1647
06:41:39,770 --> 06:41:42,409
I just was through it because of this. I just saw a hundred percent again.

1648
06:41:46,459 --> 06:42:04,619
Oh, we have to refresh it because that's not going to work. What are you guys doing?

1649
06:42:08,040 --> 06:42:17,799
Oh my God. All right. It looks like we're going to enchanted worlds, enchanted worlds,

1650
06:42:18,680 --> 06:42:26,459
13%. 26% of everybody is throwing their vote into the garbage can into the garage door.

1651
06:42:29,430 --> 06:42:33,270
Enchanted worlds. That sounds like fun to me. I'm glad people are just clicking

1652
06:42:33,270 --> 06:42:49,049
random places on the screen. I genuinely made this. Yeah. It's me slapping myself in the face.

1653
06:42:50,180 --> 06:42:57,659
We're picking games like you asked enchanted world. Does it open? I don't know. We'll

1654
06:42:57,659 --> 06:43:15,130
find out. It's data including phone numbers, addresses, email addresses. Here it comes.

1655
06:43:15,689 --> 06:43:25,159
Are we talking about the face slap? No. Well, all this one did is just made my

1656
06:43:25,159 --> 06:43:33,000
screen look fucked up. This one works. It's not the game. All right. Enchanted worlds.

1657
06:43:52,819 --> 06:43:59,400
How to play. It's divided into cells. Each cell can contain a letter. To guess a word,

1658
06:43:59,400 --> 06:44:03,560
you should select the letters in the order in which they're used by clicking on them and

1659
06:44:03,560 --> 06:44:27,430
then press the submit button. Guess a word. How you can hear me. Gotcha. Half-Life 2?

1660
06:44:28,790 --> 06:44:34,869
Half-Life scores. Music is too quiet. No, it's in a perfect audible level.

1661
06:44:39,930 --> 06:44:46,680
There. All right. Treasure mode. I didn't even start. This removes your previous game.

1662
06:44:47,799 --> 06:44:59,799
Continue. What are you talking about? I've never opened this game. This is actually kind

1663
06:44:59,799 --> 06:45:13,619
of scaring me. Okay. So we got satir. It's already on the list. Okay. Tyrannosaurus.

1664
06:45:14,819 --> 06:45:53,020
The word's already on the list. I just put it there. You have to be connected.

1665
06:46:17,610 --> 06:46:48,340
Irui. It's already there. Well, they gotta be connected. What does this do? Oh, you add

1666
06:46:48,340 --> 06:47:07,639
letters. What? Oh, man. Just get them all up there. Make this easier. Okay. OBS. The

1667
06:47:07,639 --> 06:47:38,259
streaming platform. Ghoul. Ghoul could be one. Nice. That word doesn't exist. The word ghost

1668
06:47:38,259 --> 06:48:24,150
does not exist. Are you sure? Bot? I have no idea. I don't have a single clue. Taste. Tasty.

1669
06:48:25,189 --> 06:49:02,060
Food. A-S-T. They have to be connected. Ta. Tab. Ghost in closet. Run. R-U. There's no U.

1670
06:49:03,020 --> 06:49:14,299
Obo. Why is my acoustic foam on the ground? Because it's falling off the walls for some reason.

1671
06:49:15,500 --> 06:50:10,470
Chanted words is done. Snowball. Snowball in. Oh, boy. This is people have kind of lost their

1672
06:50:10,470 --> 06:50:20,540
minds here. Snowball bust out is the one. This next one. Okay. The whole top row. Yeah,

1673
06:50:20,540 --> 06:50:25,669
we're going. Snowball bust out. We got to pick up the pace. We got to get this done

1674
06:50:25,669 --> 06:50:48,180
in the next 30 minutes. Snowball bust out does not open. So call it. Try again. What's this one?

1675
06:50:48,900 --> 06:51:06,009
Business boardwalk. Seen a lot of clicks. Board. Business boardwalk. Get it open. It opens.

1676
06:51:06,009 --> 06:51:26,200
That's a good sign. You guys can't even fucking see. Speaking of not being able to see.

1677
06:51:26,200 --> 06:51:40,790
Hold on. What happened to OBS? It doesn't exist. It's off my monitor. I don't know

1678
06:51:40,790 --> 06:51:53,830
where OBS is. You guys are going to have to tell me if you can see this because there's

1679
06:51:53,830 --> 06:52:11,209
no way I can. You let me know. You can't even see anything. I'm going to drag the window down.

1680
06:52:11,849 --> 06:52:25,139
Try this again. I have to exit the game. So I have to go from, I have to drag it.

1681
06:52:25,779 --> 06:52:40,490
So I have to take this and drag this down here. Like that. Probably right. I would assume

1682
06:52:40,490 --> 06:52:49,419
something like that. Give it a try. All we can do is try. What the fuck was this game called?

1683
06:52:52,150 --> 06:53:21,659
Boardwalk. Can you see? See it? Come on. Did I do it right? All right. Here we go.

1684
06:53:21,659 --> 06:53:39,049
New game. Select your card. Red, beige, teal. Teal. Add a human player. No, no, no, no.

1685
06:53:39,049 --> 06:53:47,909
Computer player. God damn it. Computer. Add a computer. Add a computer. All right. Start.

1686
06:53:48,950 --> 06:53:54,490
Is this going to be, is this Monopoly? Holy shit. This is Monopoly.

1687
06:53:54,490 --> 06:54:01,049
What are these gems? Racket? They're taunting me here with the tennis bullshit.

1688
06:54:09,720 --> 06:54:15,750
Five. Owning a store entitles you to collect rent from other players.

1689
06:54:30,900 --> 06:54:44,169
It's cereal box Monopoly. Let us play Monopoly. Guys, you understand the,

1690
06:54:45,130 --> 06:54:55,299
what are you going to click on? There's roll the dice. I can just roll the dice for you.

1691
06:54:55,299 --> 06:55:03,860
I got the wheel of death. Place your bet on red and black, high, low. If you win,

1692
06:55:03,860 --> 06:55:08,259
your bet will be multiplied by two. When the outcome is zero, your bet will be multiplied by 13.

1693
06:55:09,299 --> 06:55:54,169
What the hell was that called? All in? Dear idiot. GG. All right, guys. We're at the point

1694
06:55:54,169 --> 06:56:02,419
of the stream where I'm going to start just fucking opening. Maybe one or two more picks

1695
06:56:02,419 --> 06:56:10,520
and then I'm just going to blow through them and we're going to try to find a good one.

1696
06:56:10,520 --> 06:56:17,259
What happened? What's a little Kirby fucker in the left? I'm getting tired.

1697
06:56:18,060 --> 06:56:41,779
That looks like we're doing Kirby. This is called Lil' Herder. It's called head drama.

1698
06:56:43,580 --> 06:56:57,139
This is full screen, but is it actually full screen? We'll find out in a minute.

1699
06:56:57,139 --> 06:57:06,790
It's possible we win. We may have found the best game.

1700
06:57:33,110 --> 06:57:36,709
And it could go in a window. Best game of the night coming up. I know. I know. You

1701
06:57:36,709 --> 06:57:38,869
can't see. I know. You can't see. I know. You can't see. I know. You can't see. I know.

1702
06:57:38,869 --> 06:57:41,509
You can't see. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Now you can.

1703
06:57:51,240 --> 06:57:59,259
All right. Lil' Herder. Welcome, Jeremy. Play. It's like game world and level.

1704
06:58:01,340 --> 06:58:08,979
And we found the next piece of copyright infringement as clear as day.

1705
06:58:08,979 --> 06:58:18,860
As absolutely clear as the sun shining. That is Kirby's face, but just poorly photoshopped.

1706
06:58:18,860 --> 06:58:39,700
Very poorly. I even said little Kirby guy. Look at the circle here. Not even an attempt

1707
06:58:39,700 --> 06:58:46,229
to feather the edge. Nope. Just drag it over in Photoshop and press quick export as PNG.

1708
06:58:54,330 --> 06:58:58,409
We've kind of, like somebody said, we've kind of just transcended to bootleg.

1709
06:59:01,959 --> 06:59:09,700
Let's try it. It's probably going to be really, really fun. Speaking of fun,

1710
06:59:11,750 --> 06:59:32,459
resizing this window again is going to be real fun. Oh my goodness. In 2014,

1711
06:59:34,020 --> 06:59:41,639
just dumping school projects. You know what? There are school, some of you guys that have made

1712
06:59:41,639 --> 06:59:50,659
video games as a school project. Seriously, it's absolutely a thousand times better than this.

1713
06:59:55,720 --> 07:00:06,009
Absolutely. World one. Angry Birds. World one is fine. I don't know what's going on.

1714
07:00:06,729 --> 07:00:11,689
Click here to place an arrow. You have to guide the wandering sheep to its home to win.

1715
07:00:11,689 --> 07:00:35,459
This is fun. It actually is. Who recommended this? Nice.

1716
07:00:38,869 --> 07:00:52,919
I was not expecting Chu Chu Rocket or the Zumbinis. Send the wolf into the hole.

1717
07:00:53,720 --> 07:00:56,040
Don't need this arrow now. Remove it with the right mouse button.

1718
07:01:03,180 --> 07:01:18,119
How you make them run into the... Ah, I get it. They run into each other.

1719
07:01:19,080 --> 07:01:24,619
They're just starving them. Real nice. Hey, real nice.

1720
07:02:09,590 --> 07:02:13,590
Oh man, we're getting... I gotta perk up, man. We're getting low energy here.

1721
07:02:14,549 --> 07:02:22,200
When I was playing the piano, I'm just sitting here like this. Look where I am right now.

1722
07:02:22,759 --> 07:02:30,680
I'm all the way back. I gotta get high energy. I got low energy here.

1723
07:02:30,680 --> 07:02:59,479
I can't fucking believe this shit. You going to sleep? Have a great night.

1724
07:03:00,119 --> 07:03:05,159
I know we're going late. A lot of you guys probably got the fuck out of here a while ago,

1725
07:03:05,159 --> 07:03:13,639
but thanks for coming. Tutorial done. Now it's my turn. What happened to my arm?

1726
07:03:14,439 --> 07:03:19,799
Okay, that was weird. I'm trying to get high energy again. Let me clean this shit off.

1727
07:03:20,520 --> 07:03:41,959
Looks better, right? I just like made my skin... Now don't even mention that because

1728
07:03:41,959 --> 07:03:48,360
that's for the ASMR joke video. I almost just mentioned a stellar joke that is hysterical.

1729
07:03:49,240 --> 07:03:55,740
Don't want to fuck that up until you see that. Almost. What am I doing here? Is that in the

1730
07:03:55,740 --> 07:04:16,630
shape to hell? How many arrows do I get? Oh, well I did it. What? Oh, I lost time.

1731
07:05:25,849 --> 07:05:47,430
Oh, I need to... and spin it. He's getting tired. I really am. I'm dropping energy.

1732
07:05:48,150 --> 07:05:54,020
It's falling. I'm trying to stay with it. I'll get it. I'll stick with it.

1733
07:05:55,060 --> 07:06:18,500
I don't have very many more to go. Don't worry. I only have mahjong. 100,000. I'm going to beat

1734
07:06:18,500 --> 07:06:51,610
this level and this actually was kind of fun. Where is this one? Williams. Oh, I waited that

1735
07:06:51,610 --> 07:07:05,540
one just go. Oh shit, there it is. That was fun. Little Kirby. There's so many left.

1736
07:07:07,580 --> 07:07:12,779
There's too many. There's too many. I didn't... I thought I could get this done in one stream.

1737
07:07:15,770 --> 07:07:22,009
How many more are actually left? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven,

1738
07:07:22,009 --> 07:07:25,930
twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty-one,

1739
07:07:25,930 --> 07:07:28,250
twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six. There's like

1740
07:07:28,250 --> 07:07:40,060
six more hours here. Just... I'm going to start opening them. Jewel mines. Go.

1741
07:07:40,060 --> 07:08:01,540
No more voting. Jewel mines. This is from the video. What did I say here?

1742
07:08:03,060 --> 07:08:07,139
Five community subs. Thank you for the five community subs skill. Really appreciate it.

1743
07:08:07,139 --> 07:08:20,840
Thank you. That was jewel mines. What's left? Jewel mines. We got a monster truck

1744
07:08:20,840 --> 07:08:40,139
stunt rally. Here it comes. Someone took a screenshot of the ghosts. What ghosts?

1745
07:08:47,419 --> 07:09:02,779
Ghosts. What the hell did I just do? I have no idea. Oh, this is the music. I remember this

1746
07:09:02,779 --> 07:09:08,869
one. Oh, great. That's yeah. Good ghost.

1747
07:09:35,479 --> 07:09:47,099
That was playing really poorly as if I was playing it. That's as good as it's going to

1748
07:09:47,099 --> 07:10:04,869
get. Uh, monster truck rally. Go. Do the tree one next? Yeah, I will. I lost.

1749
07:10:04,869 --> 07:10:43,189
I forgot about this. Shit. The same exact thing happened in the video. Remember this

1750
07:10:43,189 --> 07:10:59,349
one? I did a James Bond reference here, right? References. References. Press H. Tree.

1751
07:10:59,349 --> 07:11:11,610
How do I do this? Change? The fuck? Frames jump. Eight. Dry river bullet. Half ring easy.

1752
07:11:12,330 --> 07:11:21,430
Hemispheres. Mixed course. Reverse climb. Simple jump. Spider truck. Spikes. The loop. Bullet.

1753
07:11:24,790 --> 07:11:25,590
Bullet. Let's try.

1754
07:11:34,220 --> 07:11:42,250
Community made workshop maps. That was very deceiving. I thought that was a

1755
07:11:42,250 --> 07:11:54,490
jump that they forgot to put the gray part in. That's not a checkpoint. Where's the

1756
07:11:54,490 --> 07:12:08,950
checkpoint then? That's not a checkpoint either. None of these are checkpoints.

1757
07:12:10,540 --> 07:12:36,419
Why is this called bullet? The game crashed. It did not. Do the loop?

1758
07:12:38,340 --> 07:12:42,279
I definitely did not play this in the video, did I?

1759
07:12:48,580 --> 07:12:54,340
I didn't even know how to change courses. I'm not sure I even attempted.

1760
07:13:02,540 --> 07:13:04,139
That's... why was it that loud?

1761
07:13:11,689 --> 07:13:47,610
Cool. All right, that was those two. Am I going to be able to get this

1762
07:13:47,610 --> 07:13:57,669
through these tonight? I'm not sure I'm gonna. What's left? The ghost in the closet.

1763
07:14:00,020 --> 07:14:12,009
Is it time to go to bed? It might be time to end this. It's been like almost seven and a half

1764
07:14:12,009 --> 07:14:19,659
hours of one of the fucking worst things ever. Do teapot pyre. We're gonna do... here's what

1765
07:14:19,659 --> 07:14:29,580
we're gonna do. We're gonna do... oh my god. I did not think this is gonna be this long.

1766
07:14:30,599 --> 07:14:38,979
We spent way too much time on checkers. Let's go over what these are gonna be.

1767
07:14:39,700 --> 07:14:46,939
And we'll play the ones that are worth playing, okay? Let me see here. So we've got

1768
07:14:48,060 --> 07:14:57,770
star cosmic bust out. Uh, yeah. No. That's gonna be a breakout clone. Star cosmic invaders. Uh,

1769
07:14:57,770 --> 07:15:11,319
yeah. That's a breakout clone. Seek and find collection two. Hey, how about that? Wait,

1770
07:15:11,319 --> 07:15:50,599
wait, wait. I'm gonna mark... We're going straight through part two tomorrow. No,

1771
07:15:50,680 --> 07:15:55,619
I can't. We can't do a part two. Part two is only going to be like an hour and 10 minutes.

1772
07:16:08,840 --> 07:16:15,909
Part two plus kanji. No, we got... We can do it. It's only... What time is it? 11, 12,

1773
07:16:15,909 --> 07:16:23,159
1, 2. It's 2 a.m. Eastern. That's fucking late as hell. All right. All right. All right.

1774
07:16:23,159 --> 07:16:45,580
All right. All right. This is the plan, okay? Tomorrow we are going to do the remaining, uh,

1775
07:16:47,029 --> 07:17:00,490
games. And, and, and, and, because it's only going to probably take like an

1776
07:17:00,490 --> 07:17:13,450
hour or two, I've wanted to play Lucius 3 for quite a long time. So we're gonna do...

1777
07:17:14,569 --> 07:17:26,819
We're gonna do this tomorrow and probably Lucius 3 as well. They made a two. Yeah,

1778
07:17:27,830 --> 07:17:34,090
they made a three. It really flew under the radar like crazy,

1779
07:17:38,119 --> 07:17:42,599
but it is getting really late. I really thought we were going to blow through this,

1780
07:17:42,599 --> 07:17:55,509
but we put a lot of time into checkers. So it's time for bed. Actual end of the stream voice.

1781
07:17:55,509 --> 07:18:00,389
We'll do it tomorrow and then we will, depending on, I mean, it depends on how long

1782
07:18:00,389 --> 07:18:05,319
that takes. I don't think we'll take that long. Look at all these Xs. We really only

1783
07:18:05,319 --> 07:18:12,919
have to probably have like another two, maybe two and a half hours. Take those Xs off. Yeah,

1784
07:18:12,919 --> 07:18:25,299
you know, I need to take, like somebody screen cap this shit. There we go. We have

1785
07:18:25,299 --> 07:18:36,869
quite a few decent ones to go through tomorrow. He plays one game for 11 hours,

1786
07:18:36,869 --> 07:18:46,250
can't play 700,000 for seven hours. Yeah, but that was one. I feel like my brain is

1787
07:18:46,250 --> 07:18:56,200
overstimulated. So we'll pick back up tomorrow the way we left off here. Still gonna do the

1788
07:18:56,200 --> 07:19:14,700
bits in game. Yeah, let me just pee and we'll come back into the bits. Does it feel wrong

1789
07:19:14,700 --> 07:19:19,020
leaving the stream half done? We're more, we are way more than half done. We're like 70%

1790
07:19:19,020 --> 07:19:27,779
done. There'll always be a part two, don't worry. So I'll see you tomorrow for this part

1791
07:19:27,779 --> 07:19:38,200
two. Lucius three. Depends on how quickly we go through these and I'm gonna go pee.

1792
07:19:38,200 --> 07:21:51,319
I'll be right back. See you guys in a second. Did you guys see the ghost? Holy, what the

1793
07:21:51,319 --> 07:22:05,500
heck? So probably like three, three thirty tomorrow. We'll get back into it. But for

1794
07:22:05,500 --> 07:22:14,680
now, let's go back a ways. Thank you binary man for the six dollars. Appreciate it.

1795
07:22:16,200 --> 07:22:22,169
Uh, this is watch the whole thing for the full experience. This file has been scanned

1796
07:22:23,049 --> 07:22:27,849

1800
07:22:54,439 --> 07:23:07,669
brave. I can't fucking believe it. I thought that guy was gone forever. Never have I ever

1801
07:23:07,669 --> 07:23:18,229
experienced something like that where one video there's an audio file and a voice actor that's

1802
07:23:18,229 --> 07:23:33,290
there and the next video he's gone. Here's the link. They replaced him with a bunch of

1803
07:23:33,290 --> 07:23:38,169
other random shit. But thank you binary man for 12 total dollars is another message here.

1804
07:23:39,750 --> 07:23:49,020
Uh, anti gnome scan. There is zero gnomes here. Sometimes more unexpected sound. Drunk

1805
07:23:49,020 --> 07:23:57,000
frog reviews French champagne to grab our attention. French French like this desert

1806
07:23:57,000 --> 07:24:06,040
rain frog champagne squeaking viral sensation. Champagne champagne has always been celebrated.

1807
07:24:06,040 --> 07:24:15,400
11 million hits and counting. It sounds like a dog toy. But actually this is a sonorous war cry.

1808
07:24:16,200 --> 07:24:23,180
Oh my god this is so fucking stupid. Of a very angry frog.

1809
07:24:28,810 --> 07:24:32,659
Thank you binary man for the 12 dollars and two great videos.

1810
07:24:33,819 --> 07:24:37,099

1820
07:25:58,169 --> 07:26:07,049
Super Mario Deluxe is sounds interesting. You could have finished the games if you ignored

1821
07:26:07,049 --> 07:26:16,040
the bits. No but I'm I am like faded right now. I'd rather attack this tomorrow and be able to

1822
07:26:16,040 --> 07:26:21,159
have some more energy and have fun. Because like I was just like that last two games was just I

1823
07:26:21,159 --> 07:26:38,700
was in the back of my chair slumped over. So don't worry it's like not even 12 24 hours

1824
07:26:38,700 --> 07:26:46,500
from now. But thank you for the 15 dollars. Moose cow. Hey Germanists would like to say

07:28:04,759 --> 07:28:12,759
around with. It's called Salmon Max. Save the world. It is it's a comedy point and click.

1837
07:28:13,639 --> 07:28:17,720
It's very charmful and funny with dialogue and puzzles. It's kind of hard to solve but

1838
07:28:17,720 --> 07:28:22,779
you'll enjoy solving them. Game is a bit slow to start. It's well worth getting deep

1839
07:28:22,779 --> 07:28:32,060
into it. Oh it also has rats. Yeah uh Salmon Max has been recommended and talked about before.

1840
07:28:32,619 --> 07:28:38,790
Maybe on one of these days where I'm just kind of hanging out. That'll be fun.

1844
07:28:56,150 --> 07:29:01,669
like an obsessive fan when I say this but you're seriously one of my favorite people on God's

1845

1848
07:29:32,700 --> 07:29:48,040
pack. I'm reliving this shit again but it is fun. It's always fun. Thank you Flank Tank for

1849
07:29:48,040 --> 07:29:51,639

1850
07:29:51,639 --> 07:30:05,430

1851
07:30:05,430 --> 07:30:11,819
Vi would want to change a pace from driving. This is a spoiler. This is gonna be like a

1852
07:30:11,819 --> 07:30:22,310
am I gonna like play a spoiler on screen? No. Like driving food. Does this mean vegetables?

1853
07:30:22,310 --> 07:30:27,830
A balanced diet means vegetables kiddo. Get used to it. Good evening everyone.

1854
07:30:33,930 --> 07:30:37,770
Thank you uh Swiggity Swanky for the one dollar. You wonder why I don't show videos

1855
07:30:37,770 --> 07:30:45,900

07:30:45,900 --> 07:30:58,569
Swanky for the one dollar. Here it is. Here is what? One right after the other really?

1857
07:30:59,959 --> 07:31:05,240
You working together? See the logical thanks for the one dollar. They say capo.

1858
07:31:06,259 --> 07:31:12,919
Capo. Avon Grad thanks for the one dollar streamer. So good at 700,000 games. He

1859
07:31:13,880 --> 07:31:39,500
Integra overflows and becomes bad at every single one. What? DG idiot. What word is that?

1860
07:31:40,060 --> 07:31:47,529
Am I saying that word wrong? Thank you P337R for the five dollars. Hey Jerma.

07:31:59,900 --> 07:32:02,700
It's time for slime. Thanks for the three dollars. Is this the song?

1863
07:32:03,580 --> 07:32:13,619
Is this the song? I don't think so.

1864
07:32:19,860 --> 07:32:37,479
Maybe it is. It might be. Drop that song link.

1865
07:32:38,279 --> 07:32:47,750
There you go. By the way there's a gnome in there. Thank you. It's time for slime. I'm not sure if

1866
07:32:47,750 --> 07:32:54,330
that's what I was thinking of but it might be. Thank you Concerto for the five dollars. Hey

1867
07:32:54,330 --> 07:32:58,740
Jerma you might be thinking of the mob song from Beauty and the Beast. Also the original

1868
07:32:58,740 --> 07:33:02,580
700,000 games is one of my favorite videos of yours. So I'm super happy you're doing

1869
07:33:02,580 --> 07:33:05,860
this. Thank you.

1870
07:33:28,299 --> 07:33:34,650
That's all I know. I don't know anything else in that whole song.

1871
07:33:35,990 --> 07:33:46,599
I don't think that's it though. Alec thanks for the one dollar Alec 4x4. Hey cool guy what kind of

1872
07:33:46,599 --> 07:33:52,759
Timberland Yeezy Supreme Gucci Jordan AirPods you got. If you're rich enough to afford 700,000

1873
07:33:52,759 --> 07:34:02,810
games you have to have all the brands on one product. Where was this during drunk karaoke

1874
07:34:02,810 --> 07:34:19,830
night? Drunk karaoke night? When was I drunk doing karaoke? I have Bo's one earphone. Thank

1875
07:34:19,830 --> 07:34:23,669
you though Alec. Thank you C4G for the three dollars. How can one streamer afford so many games?

1876
07:34:24,389 --> 07:34:33,610
Because they're in a big package. They come in one disc. Now thank you Dr. Clay for the one dollar.

1877
07:34:33,610 --> 07:34:47,430
I got no words. Bug frenzy. Windows game 2004. It says it's Minecraft. Is it because

1878
07:34:47,430 --> 07:34:51,110
of the textures? That's kind of what like cobblestone looks like. Is it like pulling

1879
07:34:51,110 --> 07:35:00,299
the cobblestone algorithm? Might be. FGWGWF thanks for the 30 dollars. Thank you.

1880
07:35:01,020 --> 07:35:07,000
So I guess Twitch isn't gonna refund my bits so I might as well give them to you.

1881
07:35:08,220 --> 07:35:12,619
You've been a huge comedic inspiration to me and since I started watching back in 2011

1882
07:35:13,180 --> 07:35:16,060
you've given me nothing but laughs all these years. Thanks for being yourself no matter what.

1883
07:35:16,779 --> 07:35:23,830
It's all I can be. I really appreciate that. I'm really sorry that you can't. Twitch had a

1884
07:35:23,830 --> 07:35:32,840
bug that had you buy a shitload of bits but I am humbled that you would want to give them

1885
07:35:32,840 --> 07:35:45,959
all to me. So thank you so much and I'm honored to be an inspiration. Thank you. Bezos isn't

1886
07:35:45,959 --> 07:35:51,930
sorry. Hans Beats thanks for the two bucks. Yo Jumbo Dumbo. Have you ever considered playing

1887
07:35:51,930 --> 07:35:58,299
the original Fable from 2004? One of the best games ever. I do enjoy that game. I think it's

1888
07:35:58,299 --> 07:36:03,979
very good. I've played through it probably twice. I played the remastered one and the

1889
07:36:03,979 --> 07:36:09,979
original one and The Lost Tales whatever the hell it was. The Lost Levels. It's a great game.

1890
07:36:12,229 --> 07:36:21,380
Maybe not on stream though. It's great. Jumbo Dumbo. Banana and Banan- Banan- Bananurism thanks for

1891
07:36:21,380 --> 07:36:25,669
the one dollar. I've been super sick the past few days. The stream has been doing a really good

1892
07:36:25,669 --> 07:36:32,919
job of cheering me up. Hope you feel better and thank you for the one dollar. Get well.

1893
07:36:32,919 --> 07:36:41,560
Get well soon. Thank you to Darkstar 700,000 games again for one dollar.

1894
07:36:41,639 --> 07:36:49,209
Germa old. Germa one guy. We got new emotes. This is the best day ever. Yeah there's new emotes.

1895
07:36:49,770 --> 07:37:01,159
Well one of them has been here already but I made it a baseline emote. Germa expensive.

1896
07:37:01,159 --> 07:37:12,419
We'll be changing to something else. Something more appropriate. Didn't I learn my lesson the

1897
07:37:12,419 --> 07:37:19,540
last time that I played this game? Yeah but I thought we were gonna get all new lessons.

1898
07:37:22,810 --> 07:37:26,729
I guess the one good thing about this is you guys can see in real time. This is kind

1899
07:37:26,729 --> 07:37:33,029
of a behind the scenes video three years later. Because even though I got

1900
07:37:33,029 --> 07:37:39,110
baited into thinking this was the second one, you guys get to see in real time how fucking

1901
07:37:39,110 --> 07:37:46,729
ridiculous and horrible this is. So live behind the scenes three years later video.

1902
07:37:48,840 --> 07:37:57,000
It's called version 2 not 700,000 games 2. Well version 2. Why would they need to release

1903
07:37:57,000 --> 07:38:09,560
a whole nother product if not to put different shit in it for money?

1904
07:38:13,529 --> 07:38:20,279
700,000 games exists. 700,000 games version 2. You gotta assume that there has to be

1905
07:38:20,279 --> 07:38:29,700
a reason for that version to exist. Don't want to seem mean but it's kind of sad to think

1906
07:38:29,700 --> 07:38:38,150
about past Germa playing these alone and talking to himself. I mean you're describing

1907
07:38:39,450 --> 07:38:58,299
almost every video I've probably ever made. That's like making a video. Yeah thank you too.

1908
07:38:59,259 --> 07:39:09,959
Again Bala Koala. Just that guy. You guys gave a shitload of money. Thank you both of you.

1909
07:39:10,759 --> 07:39:13,959
Smelly boy thanks for the one dollar. Well if it's for another game,

1910
07:39:14,680 --> 07:39:24,389
here's your money greedy streamer. What do you mean greedy streamer? What did I do? Hey

1911
07:39:24,389 --> 07:39:30,340
flug boy. Thanks for the five dollars. Jesus I think this stream has given me PTSD to the video.

1912
07:39:30,340 --> 07:39:36,520
I just want to say hope you're doing well. Hope your heya is cheering you on all the way

1913
07:39:36,520 --> 07:39:41,819
to the end of this shit show of a race tonight. Also looked at the old pax photos

1914
07:39:41,819 --> 07:39:50,950
of when I met you and low-key got sad. Sad. You should be happy. It was a fun time.

1915
07:39:51,509 --> 07:40:04,979
I hope my donation is on soon. I have to pee so bad. Let me tell you I don't see it

1916
07:40:04,979 --> 07:40:10,069
for a little while. But thank you flug boy. Don't be sad. That's like that was a great

1917
07:40:10,069 --> 07:40:19,369
experience. I had a lot of fun. I always have fun when I do meet and greets. Stop so he can pee.

1918
07:40:20,090 --> 07:40:25,659
Did just that guy give another 20 dollars. How do I join? And don't question my choices on

1919
07:40:25,659 --> 07:40:33,259
getting your attention. How do you vote? I think we may have uh hopefully you have to

1920
07:40:33,259 --> 07:40:39,029
install the extension maybe or refresh the page. Hopefully you got it. Thank you just that

1921
07:40:39,029 --> 07:40:49,419
guy for the huge amount of money. Uh numble or no no it's numb legs not numble. Thanks for the

1922
07:40:49,419 --> 07:40:56,700
ten dollars and two cents. Love you Jeremy. Thank you. Stop so I can pee please. All right

1923
07:40:56,700 --> 07:41:11,319
go go go now. Right now. Quick read his message. No he can pee. Come right back.

1924
07:41:11,319 --> 07:41:21,900
Uh just that guy gave another 40 dollars. This is this is all part of just that guy's

1925
07:41:22,700 --> 07:41:31,450
uh spree of a shitload of money. So thank you just that guy. 40 dollars, 50 dollars,

1926
07:41:31,450 --> 07:41:41,369
50 dollars, 60 you've given an extreme amount. And they say cool witch will burn down your

1927
07:41:41,369 --> 07:41:48,180
village and will still be styling while doing it. I can't fucking believe you guys found that

1928
07:41:48,180 --> 07:42:06,650
so quickly. Thank you so much just that guy. You back? Did you pee? You're back. All right

1929
07:42:06,650 --> 07:42:10,310
welcome back. Hey frody and weapon thanks for the seven dollars. This stream has been

1930
07:42:10,310 --> 07:42:14,630
the highlight of my week. Thanks jerma heart. Which emote should most definitely be a thing?

1931
07:42:16,150 --> 07:42:23,000
Which emote? Well let me I need to see the legality of that. But thank you for the seven

1932
07:42:23,000 --> 07:42:36,619
dollars. It's time for slime. Gave the 50 dollars earlier showing the witch. For litty

1933
07:42:37,419 --> 07:42:42,939
we got you earlier too. 50 fucking dollars. Thank you guys. You guys are unbelievable.

1934
07:42:44,889 --> 07:42:48,090
Uh thank you scribble for the one dollar. This is the hardest I've laughed in a while.

1935
07:42:48,090 --> 07:42:58,439
Thanks jerma. The surfing witch. Yeah and that was that was ridiculous. Great Canadian fuck club.

1936
07:43:00,500 --> 07:43:04,580
Gave 10 community subs. I think I missed it. Amphiric gave five. Thank you both of you.

1937
07:43:06,020 --> 07:43:09,540
Solid milk. Thanks for one dollar. Great stream jerma. I just got a fireman shirt today

1938
07:43:09,540 --> 07:43:13,860
and your stream to give me something to look forward to. Fireman is one of the best

1939
07:43:13,860 --> 07:43:25,619
characters ever created so don't blame you. It's the spy theme from tf2. What's what is

1940
07:43:25,619 --> 07:43:39,799
the spy theme? What are you talking about? I think it actually is.

1941
07:43:45,590 --> 07:43:59,020
Well it was obvious. He's the red spy. Kill me. Yeah you got it I think.

1942
07:43:59,740 --> 07:44:08,259
But thank you solid milk. Thank you clockwork for the one dollar. Jerma our favorite gnome

1943
07:44:08,259 --> 07:44:14,709
has a song for you. I paid real money for you to listen to this. So please listen. This

1944
07:44:14,790 --> 07:44:23,959
is the guy's website. I'm not clicking on this. This is this is just clicking on a gnome

1945
07:44:24,900 --> 07:44:30,200
and knowing that I'm clicking on it. Just pretend I did. I paid money for that.

1946
07:44:31,669 --> 07:44:44,020
He paid real money to have me get gnomed. Yeah I'll do it for you. Look let me click it.

1947
07:44:44,020 --> 07:44:51,340
All right here it is. Clicked it.

1948
07:44:51,340 --> 07:44:56,779
Oh

1949
07:45:00,090 --> 07:45:13,349
Shit. Got me. He stopped the stream for me to pee. Now you have to listen to the song.

1950
07:45:14,069 --> 07:45:24,459
Well you only get to be the one guy at least once. No I mean you only get to be the one guy

1951
07:45:24,459 --> 07:45:36,099
once. You might not be the one guy again. Doesn't mean it won't happen. I stopped the stream

1952
07:45:37,189 --> 07:45:44,740
for you to go to the bathroom. As the one guy you clocked in your one guy ticket there.

1953
07:45:48,119 --> 07:45:52,119
Now you could another day you could. Like tomorrow the next day. But you can only

1954
07:45:52,119 --> 07:46:07,189
exchange one guy ticket once per day. Or maybe once a week. Not a gnome. And do I learn

1955
07:46:07,189 --> 07:46:13,020
anything? Thank you clockwork though. I hope you had a good bathroom break. Thank you

1956
07:46:13,020 --> 07:46:15,900
demonic cucumber for the one dollar. You never find the witch image. Can't you see?

1957
07:46:16,459 --> 07:46:19,099
It was the two images edited together. Chat has failed.

1958
07:46:19,900 --> 07:46:24,979
It really might be those two edited together to fuck with infringement.

1959
07:46:26,389 --> 07:46:39,189
Hey C Clampus thanks for the ten dollars. Tell Andre I say hi. Uh I don't who's what do

1960
07:46:39,189 --> 07:46:56,630
you mean Andre? Andre. All right well hi. Hi. Jess homeboy thanks for the one dollar. You say

1961
07:46:56,630 --> 07:47:00,229
how do they have the balls to be so lazy? But it's because people like you give them

1962
07:47:00,229 --> 07:47:08,150
eleven dollars for these half broken flash games. But no one else is buying this.

1963
07:47:12,330 --> 07:47:16,169
There's not there can't be that many people that purchase this game. They probably make like

1964
07:47:16,889 --> 07:47:29,639
three or four hundred dollars a year on these games. Thousands of moms buy for their kids.

1965
07:47:29,639 --> 07:47:36,340
I don't think that's even possible. Grandma Christmas presents? Maybe.

1966
07:47:38,490 --> 07:47:42,650
Dirtball Drop is a standalone game and it costs about six dollars so it's a great deal

1967
07:47:42,650 --> 07:47:56,139
actually. That's awesome. I love how you know that. That's kind of it is worth it. Maybe it is.

1968
07:48:00,840 --> 07:48:04,040
Thank you uh Sachari for the five dollars. This is the worst.

1969
07:48:05,779 --> 07:48:08,419
All right one okay we're getting to the point where I slapped myself in the face.

1970
07:48:09,380 --> 07:48:17,659
Uh thank you five dollars Sachari. Man-dom-rec-man-dom requiem thanks for the one dollar.

1971
07:48:17,659 --> 07:48:20,459
Captain Worgen thanks for one dollar. While watching this stream I keep having the

1972
07:48:20,459 --> 07:48:24,860
feeling it's going to cut off suddenly and the old Jerma outro is going to play.

1973
07:48:27,020 --> 07:48:36,900
Not tonight. Thank you Resolute Rogue for the ten dollars. No message just thanks for ten dollars.

1974
07:48:36,900 --> 07:48:42,790
Thank you. Means a lot. Tingy thanks for one dollar. After that slap you're going to be on

1975
07:48:42,790 --> 07:48:53,049
live uh mostly lost thanks for the one dollar. It's me slapping myself in face.

1976
07:48:54,580 --> 07:49:01,180
For some reason I don't know why but uh one anime review. Oh yeah that's right I forgot.

1977
07:49:01,180 --> 07:49:12,220
Huge announcement. I watched One Punch Man. It was it was pretty it was pretty great.

1978
07:49:12,779 --> 07:49:19,659
That was my 2019 anime. I'm only allowed to watch one. I thought it was really good.

1979
07:49:20,220 --> 07:49:41,299
I like the characters. Interesting concept. See you in 2020. Season two is coming out too.

1980
07:49:41,299 --> 07:49:45,860
Yeah I like when he punches people and he doesn't want in one time you know what I mean.

1981
07:49:48,009 --> 07:49:52,569
Hey thanks for the emote though. That will maybe one day be an emote. I don't know maybe.

1982
07:49:53,290 --> 07:49:56,569
Hey the wombat from hell thanks for the one dollar. I'm almost done with my senior year

1983
07:49:56,569 --> 07:50:00,569
but I feel worse than I ever have in my life because of what my doctor believes to be IBS

1984
07:50:01,209 --> 07:50:06,659
and OAB. I feel useless vulnerable and like I can't go anywhere without risking pain all the

1985
07:50:06,659 --> 07:50:10,979
time. I know you struggle with something similar in your youth and I was wondering

1986
07:50:10,979 --> 07:50:13,939
if you had any advice for managing getting through embarrassing medical problems at a young

1987
07:50:13,939 --> 07:50:22,409
age. Well first of all sorry that you're going through that because it sucks. Second of

1988
07:50:22,409 --> 07:50:31,130
all it is a it's a never-ending process. Sometimes I've actually I've been I felt pretty

1989
07:50:31,130 --> 07:50:40,630
good in the kind of IBD department but I've been having some issues recently but you just

1990
07:50:40,630 --> 07:50:46,869
got to get a good doctor. Try to get a good doctor that gives a shit and you just got to

1991
07:50:46,869 --> 07:50:55,720
try to manage it with medicine. Sometimes you might have to change your diet. That was a big

1992
07:50:55,720 --> 07:51:08,490
one for me. Try to keep a positive outlook even though it's hard to do. I had a lot of

1993
07:51:08,490 --> 07:51:16,500
fucking problems. I had I missed get togethers, family events. I almost missed my sister's wedding

1994
07:51:17,139 --> 07:51:22,659
because of that shit. I almost couldn't go or participate in my sister's goddamn wedding

1995
07:51:23,459 --> 07:51:32,069
so I know what it's like. I know how that feels. But a couple years later maybe three

1996
07:51:32,069 --> 07:51:39,299
years later four years later I started to feel better. I was on a good program. Started

1997
07:51:39,299 --> 07:51:49,819
doing a different medical procedure and I'm still I'm still going and I feel better than

1998
07:51:49,819 --> 07:52:05,189
I did absolutely six seven eight years ago. Just keep at it. It's tough. It really it sucks

1999
07:52:05,750 --> 07:52:11,270
and I wish there was some magic wand that I could wave to give you the answers and to tell

2000
07:52:11,270 --> 07:52:23,560
you that you know I would get rid of it. I wish I could. I love how somebody just wrote

2001
07:52:23,639 --> 07:52:32,970
Yeah fuck the Patriots. Honestly what conversation are you having? What?

2002
07:52:46,009 --> 07:52:51,779
But yeah that's the best advice I can give. Try to keep it's really easy to be negative

2003
07:52:52,340 --> 07:53:05,240
and to fall into the negative trap. Just try to balance your diet out and listen to your

2004
07:53:05,240 --> 07:53:12,779
doctor and go from there. Jeremy have you ever thought about that urinome because of how

2005
07:53:12,779 --> 07:53:22,470
small that I am? No gnomes are a foot and a half tall. Please please do not put me.

2006
07:53:22,470 --> 07:53:37,450
Excuse me. I'm at least I'm at least a high elf okay. At least give me that. At least.

2007
07:53:47,110 --> 07:53:53,659
I'm at least an elf and I'm not talking about the Christmas pack your presents elf.

2008
07:53:54,380 --> 07:54:05,779
I'm talking about a RPG elf. God I wish that was me. Hey mostly lost thanks for one dollar.

2009
07:54:05,779 --> 07:54:10,500
Those hidden object games were just somebody's sophomore project in computer science 210

2010
07:54:10,500 --> 07:54:18,250
that they tried to make money off of by copying 20 times. Maybe yeah I don't understand how

2011
07:54:19,049 --> 07:54:25,349
I guess you just have to bloat it up. Dark star 700,000 games thanks to the one dollar

2012
07:54:25,349 --> 07:54:30,790
you have to watch that slap clip again at half speed. It makes it infinitely funnier.

2013
07:54:31,509 --> 07:54:56,380
Where is it? How do I do that? Give me fucking break. Oh you want to fight? You want to

2014
07:54:56,380 --> 07:55:24,090
fuck? Fight me? Don't fuck? I don't know if I'm ready for this. Oh you want to fight? You

2015
07:55:24,090 --> 07:55:39,669
want to fuck? Fight me? Don't fuck come at me. Hold on. All right here we go. Let's see what

2016
07:55:39,669 --> 07:55:52,599
it's like. Oh you want to fight? You want to fuck? Fight me? Don't fuck come at me. Don't.

2017
07:55:55,020 --> 07:55:55,520
Oh.

2018
07:56:03,080 --> 07:56:12,500
Trunk. This is stone cold sober. This is on this is on caffeine and spaghetti.

2019
07:56:13,819 --> 07:56:34,979
You want to fight? Don't fuck come at me. Don't. You can see me trying to pull it back too.

2020
07:56:34,979 --> 07:57:06,139
That's the worst part. Fucking moron. It synced so well that it's the game. It is the game

2021
07:57:06,139 --> 07:57:10,779
sound because I was... play the other one. The other sound is the same exact sound.

2022
07:57:10,779 --> 07:57:25,700
Remember when I did it the first time? Can I fart backwards? What does that even mean?

2023
07:57:25,700 --> 07:57:30,860
All right we're almost done. Thank you to mostly lost for the one dollar.

2024
07:57:31,580 --> 07:57:38,549
Garfy the monday killer thanks for one dollar. Hold on this is this it?

2025
07:57:39,110 --> 07:57:53,299
It's just so fucking irritating. Yeah see. Listen to that sound. That's not that's the first

2026
07:57:53,299 --> 07:58:14,709
one. Fucking irritating. Lies. What? Uh but thank you Garfy the swiggity swanky gave me a sub so

2027
07:58:14,709 --> 07:58:18,950
I'm gonna give him a swiggity thanky. All the cats in the chat are nuts about your stream

2028
07:58:18,950 --> 07:58:27,619
Jerma. Make yourselves known cats and chat. Give us some of those poggers in here. The crowd is

2029
07:58:27,619 --> 07:58:37,319
going nuts. Garf is honored to be the honorary feline ambassador to the Jerma brand. Years from

2030
07:58:37,319 --> 07:58:40,520
now people are going to look back on these streams and say that's Garf up there up on the

2031
07:58:40,599 --> 07:58:45,959
stairs. I don't know why I'm up on the stairs. I probably got shipped off to space. Stars.

2032
07:58:50,700 --> 07:58:54,540
GoldenCricket thank you Garfy. Thank you GoldenCricket for the four dollars. Good stream Jerma.

2033
07:58:54,540 --> 07:58:59,020
Here is CeleryMan. Now Tain I can get into. Oh yeah I know what CeleryMan is.

2034
07:59:06,709 --> 07:59:14,200
Could you kick up the uh 43d 3d 3d 3d? Could you kick up the 4d 3d?

2035
07:59:15,240 --> 07:59:20,650
Thank you GoldenCricket. It's a classic. Uh demoniccucumber thanks for one dollar.

2036
07:59:20,650 --> 07:59:28,619
The guy on the tennis championship icon is me doing the the walk in quotes. Maybe. Darkstar

2037
07:59:28,619 --> 07:59:32,459
thanks for the one dollar. The chat draws a phallus on screen joke. Will never not be funny

2038
07:59:32,459 --> 07:59:38,139
because every time you just know that a room of 5,000 people all without words knew what they

2039
07:59:38,139 --> 07:59:46,700
would do. Yeah. Sirdub thanks for the one dollar. I've been watching your streams for

2040
07:59:46,700 --> 07:59:51,259
about a year. I'm hoping this 2019 goes well for the stream. I also suggest a game called

2041
07:59:51,259 --> 07:59:58,900
Infamous. I feel like you might like it. Yeah Infamous. It's cool. It's on the radar.

2042
07:59:58,900 --> 08:00:04,409
I actually was thinking about doing it a couple days ago but PS Now doesn't really work that

2043
08:00:04,409 --> 08:00:09,720
well for me. So I would probably want to figure out a way to do it without PS Now.

2044
08:00:10,439 --> 08:00:17,180
We'll look into it. Thank you Sirdub. Thank you MetalSocks for the ten dollars

2045
08:00:17,180 --> 08:00:22,340
super frog or riot. Played it in the is the first one we played. Thank you for the

2046
08:00:22,340 --> 08:00:28,939
ten dollars. Appreciate it. Thank you CompactViewer for the ten dollars.

2047
08:00:29,659 --> 08:00:33,590
It's been a few years now since my friend introduced me to you. We used to watch your

2048
08:00:33,590 --> 08:00:37,990
videos on the way home from school on the bus. Thanks for all the good memories. A fan.

2049
08:00:40,389 --> 08:00:47,259
Happy to be there on the bus. Thank you so much for watching for as long as you have.

2050
08:00:49,209 --> 08:00:55,560
CompactViewer thanks for the ten dollars. Am I the only one who wants Derma to go

2051
08:00:55,560 --> 08:00:59,799
with his Dreamcast promise? He's just been delaying it for so long it makes me sad.

2052
08:01:10,659 --> 08:01:13,860
It is just sitting back there. That's what the ghost was guys. Take a look.

2053
08:01:14,659 --> 08:01:25,290
The ghost is the Dreamcast. Look. You see? Can you see the Dreamcast? It's right there

2054
08:01:25,290 --> 08:01:38,299
on the right side. Top right next to the door. That's what the ghost was all along.

2055
08:01:38,299 --> 08:01:41,900
Hey PeacefulHaley thanks for the one dollar. I can't believe you lied about not liking

2056
08:01:41,900 --> 08:01:45,900
anime. How can I watch a streamer who watches anime? I'm so disappointed.

2057
08:01:46,619 --> 08:02:02,729
Why? It's a TV show. It's a television show. So he's never going to play Dreamcast because

2058
08:02:02,729 --> 08:02:13,110
it's a ghost. I don't base what genre of TV show or movie I'm going to watch.

2059
08:02:14,549 --> 08:02:21,459
How do people rate it? Is it rated? Has it got like an 89%? 78%? I might watch it.

2060
08:02:26,299 --> 08:02:29,900
It was enjoyable. I'm not going to go get a One Punch Man

2061
08:02:30,860 --> 08:02:39,049
14-inch figurine to put on my desk. I'm not going to dress up as Saitama for Halloween this year.

2062
08:02:42,490 --> 08:02:49,770
I'm not going to order the Blu-rays through Amazon Prime. All of those things are lies and

2063
08:02:49,770 --> 08:03:00,490
they're all on the way. Thank you Bonjor. Thank you Bonjor Tristan for the one dollar.

2064
08:03:00,490 --> 08:03:04,009
Bonjor Tristan again for the one dollar. Dermot please read this out loud.

2065
08:03:16,060 --> 08:03:35,849
What happened to F? It was a sign of respect. I lost two ranks in League. What happened?

2066
08:03:35,849 --> 08:03:46,729
I don't get it. This is how you meme kids are repaying me. Thank you Double D for the one

2067
08:03:46,729 --> 08:03:57,299
dollar. It's a clip. Oh yeah I'm not gonna help. Thank you Smelly Boy for the one dollar. This

2068
08:03:57,299 --> 08:04:03,540
is a fever dream. It sure is. Space Dad thanks for the one dollar. F G W G W F thanks

2069
08:04:03,540 --> 08:04:06,979
for the five dollars. All these games that won't open are all going to open at the same time

2070
08:04:06,979 --> 08:04:18,060
later tonight and nuke your PC. Oh that would be terrifying. Thank you Zaldi for the one dollar.

2071
08:04:18,060 --> 08:04:21,979
Dermot let's be real. The follow through on your pimp hand is godlike.

2072
08:04:25,340 --> 08:04:34,490
Thank you Jax for the five dollars. Jax3636. Thank you for five dollars. Appreciate it.

2073
08:04:35,209 --> 08:04:38,330
Demonic Cucumber thanks for the one dollar. This Connect Four game isn't fair. You could

2074
08:04:38,330 --> 08:04:42,090
literally see the next three moves we were planning from the get-go. If you want it to be

2075
08:04:42,090 --> 08:04:49,020
fair bring in a mediator or let us vote on grid references. No you guys can click the screen.

2076
08:04:49,020 --> 08:04:52,950
You know what you're doing. Hey Ike Turtle thanks for the one dollar. You ever thought

2077
08:04:52,950 --> 08:04:56,229
about doing board games with chat? Like a bunch of stuff. Tonight's stream with the

2078
08:04:56,229 --> 08:05:00,709
Connect Four was pretty fun. I think it would be wicked rad to do other games against it as

2079
08:05:00,709 --> 08:05:09,930
well. Also we can see how you cheat in other games as well. If there was a system

2080
08:05:09,930 --> 08:05:13,130
in place where because it is it's actually really hard to do what we were doing.

2081
08:05:13,849 --> 08:05:21,610
Because I have to activate the extension. Let you guys vote. Turn it off and restart it

2082
08:05:23,209 --> 08:05:27,930
for every single time you guys could click on the screen. So if there was a more streamlined

2083
08:05:27,930 --> 08:05:36,810
way to do that I would love to. It's an interesting idea if there's some extension

2084
08:05:36,810 --> 08:05:44,020
or something in the future might be worth trying. But it was fun. I had a blast.

2085
08:05:45,259 --> 08:05:51,659
Uh three TS Luke thanks for the five dollars. I haven't donated since you were in Anor Londo

2086
08:05:52,299 --> 08:06:00,939
so here's more patronage. Patronage. I just said Patreonage. The internet has destroyed me.

2087
08:06:03,319 --> 08:06:07,959
Thank you Fuzzy Muffins for the ten dollars. Thank you for playing with us Jerma. Gigi

2088
08:06:07,959 --> 08:06:14,580
idiot. You know you love it. Thank you Fuzzy Muffins for the ten bucks. I do. It's always

2089
08:06:16,409 --> 08:06:20,330
Dark Star. 700,000 games thanks for the one dollar. Just thought I'd ruin Connect 4 for you.

2090
08:06:21,700 --> 08:06:25,299
All right if neither player makes a mistake during the game the winner will be determined

2091
08:06:25,299 --> 08:06:31,939
by where the first piece was placed. If the first piece is placed on either end that player

2092
08:06:31,939 --> 08:06:37,299
will lose. If the first piece is placed in the center that player will win. And if the

2093
08:06:37,299 --> 08:06:46,360
first piece is placed that in the in between it will result in a draw. Good to know from

2094
08:06:46,360 --> 08:06:53,060
when I want to beat my friends. I mean and I already did tonight. You know you know you two

2095
08:06:53,700 --> 08:07:00,490
you two beat you guys. You two there. The two of you that were playing. Mostly lost thanks

2096
08:07:00,490 --> 08:07:05,619
for the one dollar. The game probably stole your stream key. Let's hope not. Peaceful Haley

2097
08:07:05,619 --> 08:07:08,659
thanks for the one dollar. Another good stream Jerma. Hope the Wild Tangent Studio doesn't

2098
08:07:08,659 --> 08:07:14,900
have your credit card and charge you 50 times for 50 more 700,000 games. Anyway I

2099
08:07:14,900 --> 08:07:18,500
would recommend playing Fallout 1. I just started playing it and the first thought I had

2100
08:07:18,500 --> 08:07:25,369
was well Jerma would enjoy this. Anyways again have a good night Jerma and chat. You as well

2101
08:07:25,369 --> 08:07:35,580
Peaceful Haley. Fallout 1 is a very very very fun game. It's kind of like Kenshi and I know

2102
08:07:35,580 --> 08:07:45,419
that comparison is very very thin but it's in the same house as Kenshi. They live in different

2103
08:07:45,419 --> 08:07:54,250
rooms. It's a Kenshi but fun. All right I am not gonna let somebody in the chat

2104
08:07:55,130 --> 08:08:00,889
say that Kenshi's not fun okay. Because that I don't believe that that is true. I believe

2105
08:08:00,889 --> 08:08:08,680
that that is not true. Okay I believe that that's not true. Done. And now you triggered

2106
08:08:08,680 --> 08:08:15,220
them. Space Dad thanks for the one dollar. They just have a heart. Thank you. Thank you

2107
08:08:15,220 --> 08:08:22,919
Space Dad. Thank you Tybe? Tib? I'm gonna call you Hovercat because that's the end of your

2108
08:08:22,919 --> 08:08:27,959
name and my brain cannot say the first part. Thank you Hovercat for the ten dollars. Hey

2109
08:08:28,040 --> 08:08:32,279
Jerma love your streams. A lot of folks in chat look up to you and consider you a positive

2110
08:08:32,279 --> 08:08:36,680
role model in their lives. My question to you is who do you look up to and consider to be

2111
08:08:36,680 --> 08:08:40,490
positive role models in your life? Thanks for all that you do. Never stop being you.

2112
08:08:42,540 --> 08:08:53,740
Um I don't know years ago I would have probably told you. George Washington.

2113
08:08:57,319 --> 08:09:09,020
Role models? I don't know about role models. I mean this is I mean this is a young Jeremy

2114
08:09:09,020 --> 08:09:15,110
answer and this is gonna people probably gonna put lul in the chat for this one but

2115
08:09:15,110 --> 08:09:40,409
I'm probably Hulk Hogan. I Hulk Hulk Hogan when I was in my early teens. Oh man I mean not

2116
08:09:40,409 --> 08:09:48,919
anymore. I don't I don't like oh yeah Hulk Hogan. No but in my kind of younger years

2117
08:09:52,330 --> 08:09:59,479
probably was Hulk Hogan. Into my late teens and teens probably 20s probably Jim Carrey.

2118
08:10:01,290 --> 08:10:09,380
I'm literally one of my favorite comedic actors ever. Jim Carrey has influenced so much in

2119
08:10:09,380 --> 08:10:20,919
the world of comedy that it's it's absolutely unbelievable. You go watch that string of Jim

2120
08:10:20,919 --> 08:10:31,939
Carrey 90s movies. Holy shit they are they're unmistakably some of the funniest movies you

2121
08:10:31,939 --> 08:10:42,330
will ever watch. He's changed a lot right recently but remember he's like he's also

2122
08:10:42,330 --> 08:10:48,840
gotten older too. He's gotten old. He's in his like what his 50s almost his 60s now.

2123
08:10:54,090 --> 08:11:02,250
It's hard to be to be Jim Carrey. The funny guy. He actually talks about that in that Jim

2124
08:11:02,250 --> 08:11:15,830
and Andy Netflix original. It's worth a watch. He's 56. Truman Show is one of my

2125
08:11:15,830 --> 08:11:34,979
favorite movies of all time. Oh my god yeah. Truman Show is fantastic. I mean do I agree

2126
08:11:34,979 --> 08:11:55,509
with literally everything he said in the last 10 years? No. Is Jim Carrey your dad?

2127
08:11:55,509 --> 08:12:07,419
Uh no but that's pretty much it. I would say those two. Thank you Space Dad for the five

2128
08:12:07,419 --> 08:12:14,389
dollars. They said uh moi. That's moi with French champagne. Uh chocolate cheese thanks

2129
08:12:14,389 --> 08:12:19,990
for the one dollar. Uh a bit of caution for Lucius 3. There's a really graphic

2130
08:12:20,549 --> 08:12:26,939
graphic scene. Oh dear. There's some really distasteful steam achievements

2131
08:12:26,939 --> 08:12:49,560
that go along with it. Uh well I'm gonna have to check that. The French champagne has always

2132
08:12:49,560 --> 08:12:56,500
been celebrated for its excellence. But thank you for the heads up. Thanks for the warning.

2133
08:13:02,360 --> 08:13:05,880
Thank you Razzle for the one dollar. Hey Jerm sorry to keep you here longer but I don't.

2134
08:13:05,880 --> 08:13:10,439
It's fine we're just hanging out. But I just had a quick question. You are so attentive

2135
08:13:10,439 --> 08:13:15,319
plus concerned about the few that don't enjoy your streams. How do you deal with negative

2136
08:13:15,319 --> 08:13:21,610
comments on your YouTube videos back in the day? Uh there's a YouTube link. Uh are you linking

2137
08:13:21,610 --> 08:13:34,380
to a comment here? Am I gonna feel bad right now? Is this gonna make me sad? Uh it's somebody

2138
08:13:34,380 --> 08:13:48,180
vaping. It was muted but it was a vape gnome. It was a gnome vape joke. It was muted so don't

2139
08:13:48,180 --> 08:13:52,500
worry. Uh how do I how do I I'm concerned about the few people that don't enjoy the

2140
08:13:52,500 --> 08:13:58,939
streams. I mean it's not necessarily. I don't think it's I don't think it's a concern about

2141
08:13:59,900 --> 08:14:08,090
people not enjoying the streams. I think it's a it's more of a concern of people thinking that

2142
08:14:08,729 --> 08:14:11,849
the thing that they're watching is not worth watching. Like boring.

2143
08:14:12,810 --> 08:14:16,490
I mean like enjoying the streams is kind of a hard way to look at it because

2144
08:14:19,400 --> 08:14:26,119
you can still enjoy something if it is boring right. There's plenty of things that I enjoy

2145
08:14:26,119 --> 08:14:36,439
that are boring. So not enjoying the streams. Yeah but like there's plenty of things that

2146
08:14:36,439 --> 08:14:46,840
are boring that you can still enjoy. I'm probably wording this in a in a stupid way but

2147
08:14:47,639 --> 08:14:51,639
negative comments you just have to take the opinion and somebody said it for a reason.

2148
08:14:53,669 --> 08:14:56,790
Somebody said something. Somebody didn't like something for a particular reason.

2149
08:14:57,909 --> 08:15:03,029
I get what you mean kind of. Well good. It's also been eight hours and I I need some

2150
08:15:03,029 --> 08:15:12,729
spaghetti so but you just kind of have to end. My internet is like going through a

2151
08:15:12,810 --> 08:15:20,139
problem right now. No we're good. But yeah you just have to let negative comments if somebody

2152
08:15:20,139 --> 08:15:23,900
wants to be mean or negative actually and not just I know a lot of people joke around we

2153
08:15:23,900 --> 08:15:29,180
go back and forth a lot of times for fun but there's a big there's a big difference between

2154
08:15:29,180 --> 08:15:36,459
mean and fun right. Like actually angry or like hateful and I don't know I can't change

2155
08:15:36,459 --> 08:15:41,430
that person's opinion. I'm not going to be able to. I told you guys this a couple days

2156
08:15:41,430 --> 08:15:47,590
ago or even like a couple weeks ago. I will never say like oh fuck the haters.

2157
08:15:48,549 --> 08:15:54,310
No because that I'm not going to change that person's mind so why antagonize them why why

2158
08:15:54,310 --> 08:15:58,229
why try to tell them that they're wrong. I'm not going to change their mind if they

2159
08:15:58,229 --> 08:16:03,959
don't think I'm funny if they don't think the streams are funny. What that's that's

2160
08:16:03,959 --> 08:16:07,799
their opinion and they're absolutely entitled and have a right to have that opinion.

2161
08:16:09,270 --> 08:16:13,029
I can't tell you that you're that's wrong because I don't know your tastes I don't

2162
08:16:13,029 --> 08:16:17,290
know what you think is interesting. I don't think this is I don't think you're very funny.

2163
08:16:17,290 --> 08:16:24,069
I don't think your streams are good. Uh well uh no you're you're wrong. I mean am I yeah it's

2164
08:16:24,069 --> 08:16:34,330
so subjective so it's I don't want to fight negative opinions because what's the point

2165
08:16:41,349 --> 08:16:44,229
just people are going to have different opinions and just that's it.

2166
08:16:45,029 --> 08:16:51,799
That's pretty much what I got to say. Hey P337R thanks for the three bucks. Hey again

2167
08:16:51,799 --> 08:17:01,880
Jerma will there be a new tier three emote? Yes there will. I want to make it worth

2168
08:17:02,599 --> 08:17:15,799

2169
08:17:15,799 --> 08:17:19,400

2170
08:17:20,459 --> 08:17:29,209

2176
08:17:59,540 --> 08:18:10,259
That's tough I don't know. No Jerma Raptor is more embarrassing. The slap was an accident.

2177
08:18:10,259 --> 08:18:18,680
The Raptor was intentional so absolutely the Raptor is way more embarrassing. Hey Fitty thanks
