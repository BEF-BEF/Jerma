1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:13,910
What's up? What's up? What's up? Hey, how are you? How you doing?

2
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:27,320
Welcome back. Another day, day three. Elden Ring will be your host for the festivities today as we

3
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:47,560
continue to trek through the lands between. Horse? What? You like the title? Yeah. How's my day been?

4
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:55,579
It's been pretty good. I want to play this game so bad. I was talking to Holly last night and I was

5
00:00:55,579 --> 00:01:00,170
like, hey, like, what if I made like another character just like I played like at the same

6
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:08,709
time? But then I realized if I were to play this game off stream, I wouldn't, there would be no

7
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:15,239
time for me to sleep or eat because I stopped the stream last night at what like 10, 11 p.m. 12,

8
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:21,319
something like that. The night before was like two o'clock in the morning. If I would play off stream

9
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:30,739
after that, there's no time for me to go to bed. Like I'm just going to bed, waking up,

10
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:37,560
doing some like morning routine, early afternoon routine stuff, and then like playing this game

11
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:51,659
for 10 straight hours. So I don't have time to make a new character. You're addicted. Yeah,

12
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:57,140
I mean it's a good feeling though. It's a really good feeling. It's hasn't, it's been a long time.

13
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:04,969
If you're going to get three streams that are eight to nine to 10 hours in a row on this channel,

14
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:09,370
you better believe that I'm very, very interested in the thing that I'm streaming.

15
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,460
When was the last time I streamed anything three times in a row?

16
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:26,580
Ever. Besides Dollhouse. It's been a very long time. House Flipper, was House Flipper three

17
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:33,500
streams in a row though? I don't think it was. Sometimes I'll do two and then I'll take like

18
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:38,620
three or four days and then do it again. But this is, it's been a while. How have I been feeling?

19
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:46,580
Um, I don't, I, I don't want to like concern anybody because if I say the wrong thing here

20
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:52,740
and people are going to get concerned. So without doing that, let me just tell you that I've been

21
00:02:52,740 --> 00:03:00,300
fine. I've been monitoring and managing how my body feels. I'm doing all right. I'm doing good.

22
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:09,349
But I would be lying if I told you that it wasn't, um, I didn't feel it.

23
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:20,090
I have been taking a Tylenol pretty much every day here. One dose, uh, kind of right before I

24
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:32,550
start. I'm doing good. And it, it works. It helps enough for it to be like, I'm fine. He's addicted

25
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:37,110
to Tylenol. No, I'm not. It's been, it's literally, I, I've been taking Tylenol. The last time I took

26
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:42,490
Tylenol was probably like, I don't know, maybe like fucking two, a month or two ago, two months

27
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:55,879
ago. No, and we're talking, I, I, look, I, I know, I know that like, you're an idiot. He's gonna,

28
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:02,819
he's gonna take too much Tylenol. Trust me when I say like medical shit, I'm very, very much aware

29
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:07,060
of everything. I'm very much in tune with how like what you should and shouldn't be doing. Trust me.

30
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:13,139
I know the exact amount of milligrams of, uh, acetaminophen that you really can't take in a 24

31
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:25,879
hour period, but trust me, I'm very aware of my body. And I am taking on a daily basis here

32
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:35,079
well below 50% of what is even addressed on the bottle. So don't worry. I'm going to be fine.

33
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:40,519
But I know people might've been concerned about, dude, do you really think you should be doing

34
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:45,879
this? Like 10 hour streams, three days in a row, like 30 hours of streaming in a row. And you have

35
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:49,160
very, you have a right to be concerned, right? Cause obviously like over the years it's been like,

36
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,920
Hey, I have a bunch of medical problems, but I'm good. I'm good. And we'll see how we feel tonight.

37
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,170
It's a very real chance that maybe tonight I'm like, let's go again tomorrow. We'll see.

38
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:08,660
There any updates on the medical stuff? No, not really. And I probably would rather not share it

39
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:15,350
anyways, because I feel like it's kind of, um, it's kind of like a downer. You haven't heard me talk

40
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:21,209
about it too much recently because it's just a downer. It just is. And I would rather like

41
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:24,329
have the mood of these streams be a place where like, I can just have fun and we can just kind of

42
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:29,449
chill and just do whatever and have a good time and have to like, you know, every week or two

43
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:33,290
kind of tell you guys like how I'm feeling and how like my back hurts and my chest hurts.

44
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,649
Cause I did that for a little while. I did, I did that for like, I don't know, there was a period

45
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:43,370
where like a few months in a row, it's like, it felt like that was kind of half the shit that I

46
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,850
talked about. So I would rather just kind of not have to talk about it really, just deal with it

47
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:51,610
on my own. And if there's something significant that I would ever tell you about, obviously I

48
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:56,089
would. Um, especially if it was going to affect the streams and you know, if I was going to need

49
00:05:56,089 --> 00:06:00,579
to take time or something, but it's kind of downer and I don't want to make it a downer

50
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:13,000
because it's something I really don't like to focus on anyways. Uh, that's it guys. Every hour

51
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,500
he's going to actually, I thought about making the title, uh, guaranteed loud sound every 30

52
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:25,259
minutes. Please adjust your volume. Um, but I kind of feel like that would be like a deterrent for

53
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:31,019
people like to not even click on the stream because that means that doesn't mean what you

54
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:35,899
guys think it means, right? Oh, he's going to scream. He's going to yell to me as somebody

55
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:40,459
that's an outside viewer that might not know this channel. That could mean like, I'm going to just

56
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:47,019
do like an ear blast sound every 30 minutes to be funny and yeah, air horns. And I feel like, yeah,

57
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:50,379
I don't think I would want to click on that stream because if you click on that stream and you're in

58
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:57,879
that period where it's like 10 seconds until a noise, what if you're not ready? Yeah, it would

59
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:06,550
be a good bit. Yeah, but good bits are only funny. You know, if everybody can enjoy them, right? Uh,

60
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:13,339
I think that having a bit that's funny and that look, people would come in maybe and they'd be

61
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:26,329
like, okay, this way there's no like going to be like air horns in my ears. Make a loud sound now

62
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:40,970
Bicycle honk every time a runes are lost. Anyways, yeah, there you go. Life update. It's time to uh,

63
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:48,149
play Elden Ring. Ready. Very excitable. And yeah, look what I got right here. I'll show you right

64
00:07:48,149 --> 00:08:09,660
now. Take a quick look. You'll see it. Got, I'm prepared. Very prepared. God, of course. What,

65
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:17,399
what would a 10 hour stream be without my fucking magical macho powder? What would a stream be

66
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:31,019
without my magical macho powder? Green shirt. It's a dollar shirt. These actually fit really

67
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:37,019
well and they're really comfortable. I was just saying that because it's my own merch.

68
00:08:40,090 --> 00:09:04,120
You look uncanny valley today. Respectful. Where have you been hiding? I took you for

69
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:11,669
now. All right. So what were we doing? Your arms then uncanny and handsome way. I'm just fucking

70
00:09:11,669 --> 00:09:19,370
around. Okay. There are some things that I, I, the last thing I did was I beat that, um, that like

71
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:29,129
sewer boss. I need to start focusing on mind because I don't have enough. I beat that boss

72
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:35,289
so early. I don't even have enough mana to summon the guy that you get for a reward for beating that

73
00:09:35,289 --> 00:09:41,929
boss. So, uh, I have to, I want to get mind up because I feel like that could be a huge,

74
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:49,669
huge game changer and you beat the game already. This is pain. Also, please permanently ban me.

75
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:57,610
Hmm. I'm thinking about it. I'm thinking about if you should get permanently banned or not.

76
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:04,389
Probably, but I'm going to do the thing you don't want and that's not do anything. Yeah.

77
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:11,350
You just, yeah. Okay. You just get to sit here and like just chat and chill and have a good time.

78
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:18,679
Fucking idiot. You just get to like hang out and like talk and like enjoy like the like company

79
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:25,740
of the other community members. Hmm. Fucking moron. Can't fucking believe it. Got them.

80
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:42,789
Yeah. Get rid of them. Yeah. Got them. All right. I need to go here. There's a few spots.

81
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:50,600
I like, I don't know what the hell happened over here, but like I ended up over here and I don't,

82
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,289
I like, look at the map. It's cut in half. I'm not supposed to be over here. And like,

83
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:59,769
I was doing shit over here. So I definitely have to be like over here or like here.

84
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:07,580
I'm not supposed to be there. The game's like, what are you doing, dude? It was rejected.

85
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:13,500
Wait, what? What did Holly say? I have to go, I have to wash some shirts. He's been sweating

86
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:24,330
through them all. I've gone through like, I mean, I'll be honest. I've gone through probably like

87
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:35,529
seven t-shirts, like six t-shirts in the last like three days, two days. I can't help it. I'm

88
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:41,879
fucking disgusting. What do you want me to tell you? My room is hot. The shirts are like

89
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:49,639
suffocating. I, this is why I don't have, I don't have the balls to do this, but like imagine if I

90
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:53,960
was just sitting here with no shirt on, just sitting here. I would be doing that right now.

91
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:58,360
I really would be, but like, I don't think I, I can't do that at this point, right? Like I can't.

92
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:05,419
I would be sitting here like this and have like a cigarette just like hanging out of my mouth.

93
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:17,460
Oh shit, man. Fuck. I would do like huge burps and shit. If only I could just be the real me on camera.

94
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:35,159
We're going to go up this way. You can literally, I'm just kidding around. He's unleashed. No,

95
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:40,740
I don't want to have my fucking shirt off on camera. Like, oh yeah, let's just be comfy and

96
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,259
like have like just sit there with no shirt on. I can imagine the amount of people that would just

97
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:48,179
like zoom in on my fucking belly button. Like what? Get the fuck out of here. Like, you know

98
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:57,740
what I mean? Like, like I'm not doing, I don't, that's why. Yeah. Cause guess what? I, I have my

99
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:02,059
shirt off just like chilling comfortable, like on cam, whatever. And like some of you guys are

100
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:09,419
going to zoom into the, my belly button, crop it really close, draw eyes up above the belly button,

101
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:15,259
add some like, like a lip detail, like to the belly button and put a nose on it and be like,

102
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:19,179
oh, new German character, like belly button Andy or something. And it's, and that, that would be,

103
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:22,299
that would be on the front page of fucking every Reddit or something. Like that would be on my

104
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:26,460
Reddit. That would be on, there'd be everywhere. And like you, you would like make that a character

105
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:34,710
and I wouldn't have any control over it. You must've thought about this way too much.

106
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:42,009
Hey, he definitely will. Yeah, of course they will. Like, what do you mean?

107
00:13:50,309 --> 00:14:01,799
He's going to show his belly button. Your character is ugly. Well, I mean, I mean,

108
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:17,320
I based it off of you. I need a glint stone key. I'm like just, I'm just doing burns today.

109
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:28,519
Elden Ring just kind of makes me like mean. Be a tank top streamer. Oh, I'm just going to wear

110
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:38,250
whatever makes me comfortable. He's wicked toxic today. All right, let's go. I want to, I need to

111
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,850
go up here. This is where the academy is, right? Cause this is where I need to go. This is the

112
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:47,289
sorcery place. We're going to go here. It's going to be a shitload of sorcery items because why would

113
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:54,809
he say, oh yes. Oh, the sorcery tower, the sorcery kingdom, all the academy of sorcerers. Like there's

114
00:14:54,809 --> 00:15:05,139
going to be like a cool ass weapon here and I'm going to be able to use it. So this way, let's go

115
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:15,029
apologize right now. Or do the Goku. It's the same effect. Oh, I don't know. I'm really, I'm

116
00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:20,710
really, I am so, you know, I'm really, I need to really, I need to really go through something to

117
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:32,740
you guys. I need to just, I'm very, very, I hope you got that. I hope that came through.

118
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:39,210
I hope it was genuine. Okay. Well, I can't go this way. So how the fuck do I get over there?

119
00:15:39,210 --> 00:16:01,929
All right. There's a path over there. God, I love this game. That path connects. Where? Here.

120
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:06,279
Where is it? Is it like a, is it water in between? No, there's not like a lake or anything. All

121
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:16,409
right. It's like, I think I can drop down and not die. Please everybody pray. Will I die from this?

122
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:38,299
Yep. Okay. I prayed for you to die. Oh, I, this is one funny one guy moment that I saw after the

123
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:43,580
fact, uh, when I was dying over and over again, and I was complaining about all the gravestones,

124
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,500
the graveyard boss member, like all the gravestones, I specifically was really,

125
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,899
really pissed off. And I was saying, what the fuck is this? Why are there so many gravestones here?

126
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:57,179
How many people have died here? This is fucking ridiculous. Somebody in chat said, uh, they're

127
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:02,549
all your gravestones. And it was like, Holy shit. I wish I caught that. That was fucking hilarious.

128
00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:14,329
My audio is delayed. I don't think it is audio like, wait, game audio. Or you mean like me.

129
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:21,500
I have a really weird way of talking. I think people like come to the stream and they, when I

130
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:29,259
have cam on, like my voice has its own mouth that makes like sounds like my down here. I can just

131
00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:33,579
sit here like this. And my vocal cords are just actually, they're, they're, they're talking under

132
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:40,809
there. There's lips down here moving. Like I can actually do that. So when I talk, my blips don't

133
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:49,259
move maybe that much. Maybe as much as you think they should be. I don't know. There's people

134
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:52,460
always go, dude, your audio is like delayed. Like sometimes your mouth doesn't move. And it's like,

135
00:17:52,460 --> 00:18:03,660
well, I don't know, man, I've got like, I've got like a mouth down here. I'm losing my mind.

136
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:09,539
He's, this dude is working. All right. Where do I go? Where do I go? I don't know where to go.

137
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:13,220
Okay. I'm fucking near, I need to settle down because like, I don't know why I act like this

138
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:20,869
when I play these games, like something about from software games, just like open up some weird

139
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:26,230
thing in my brain where like, I'm constantly just not being serious and just constantly just

140
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:31,349
fucking around. It never stops. It only stops when I go into a boss room and then I get like mad

141
00:18:31,349 --> 00:18:47,900
and I hate everybody. We was weird. How the fuck do I get over there? He's having so much fucking

142
00:18:47,900 --> 00:19:00,329
fun. Monka S I think that might be what it is. Wait. Oh, okay. All right. This is it right here.

143
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:05,210
Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good. By the way, the more the less that I move my lips,

144
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:10,089
the less calories that I burn in my like mouth. So it means I can talk way longer

145
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:15,049
because my mouth doesn't get like tired by like talking. So like I can rest my mouth and I can

146
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:23,740
really speak very, very clearly for a long period of time. All right. Finally, let's go.

147
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:45,259
Stream begins now. Okay. Microwave boy. Microwave boy. That sounds like a really,

148
00:19:45,579 --> 00:19:53,900
stupid shitty superhero. Microwave boy to save the day. Oh, how did you get your powers?

149
00:19:54,619 --> 00:20:02,259
I was making popcorn one day and I opened it up midway through and I breathed in too much of the

150
00:20:02,259 --> 00:20:24,710
microwave radiation. Oh, I accidentally microwaved myself. Okay. What? How? He heats up too many hot

151
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:31,190
pockets. Yeah. I don't know how I got all you can like shoot like radio waves through his fingers.

152
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:52,470
And it's like, well, what happened, dude? I ate four hot pockets a day for 10 years. Oh no,

153
00:20:52,470 --> 00:21:07,029
he's slipping into do watch out. Watch out. Get out of here. Whoa. We've got a sauce.

154
00:21:07,829 --> 00:21:37,799
We must be getting close to the academy. Oh, gauntlets. This is going to be a big deal. I

155
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:48,380
actually can't wait to be here. I think that's it up there. The big castle looking thing. Oh,

156
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:58,410
fine. Let's go. Take them on. Oh, fine. Let's go. Take them on. And finally,

157
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:10,900
so I got my flasks refilled because I cleared the camp. Let's go explore. Do doofenshmirtz or riot.

158
00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:16,099
I just, I offhandedly didn't do for it. I don't think I could even do it again if I really even

159
00:22:16,099 --> 00:22:28,890
tried. Oh, I could probably do it. I can't do it. I need to hear it a few times. If I were to listen

160
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:32,650
to it, if I were to watch an episode of Phineas and Ferb, I would probably do a much better job

161
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:51,609
because I need to hear it. So anything else here? I don't think so. I got like that cookbook thing,

162
00:22:51,609 --> 00:22:56,329
which I have to sit down. And I know like stalling stalling, hurry up and play the game.

163
00:22:56,329 --> 00:23:00,569
But I do need to sit down and figure out that all the cooking cookbook crafting stuff.

164
00:23:04,569 --> 00:23:22,549
That's something that needs to be done. This place is pretty narrow. So wait, oh, what's over here?

165
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:28,069
Can we move on to the academy? Or do I go look at the lake and get a dragon to drop on me again?

166
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:42,569
Go in the tent, please. Tent, please, please. The tent. Shut up. Sorry, I can't get it to stop.

167
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:49,750
It's like too much fun to just like pretend to like be mad at people. I don't know. I don't know

168
00:23:49,750 --> 00:24:20,920
what this game is. It's weird to me. What tent? Tent? 139. I don't know what you mean by tent.

169
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:38,539
There's nothing in any of these tents. Oh, I was going to leave. You're pretending. I honestly got

170
00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:45,400
it. I don't. I think you're just fucking with me. What's in one of the tents? Guys, I'm only

171
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:51,240
streaming for like 10 hours today. We don't have time for this. What? Where? In the tent.

172
00:24:55,180 --> 00:25:08,859
How was I supposed to see that? There's nothing even in here. It's just a smoldering butterfly.

173
00:25:08,859 --> 00:25:21,059
You guys are acting like it was a fucking great sword. I don't know how people see that shit.

174
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:33,099
How do you even see that? What? Wow. That looks cool. We're taking a second here. Wow. This is so

175
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:48,900
cool. This looks unbelievable. It does look so good. Oh, I can already see. I can already see

176
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:53,539
the VATI videos on this game, right? Like I can't wait. I can't wait to beat this game,

177
00:25:53,539 --> 00:25:58,099
have no fucking idea what happened, have absolutely no idea who any of the characters' names are,

178
00:25:58,099 --> 00:26:05,559
and then watch like four hours of VATI videos where he gets to tell me everything. He'll just

179
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:17,500
tell me literally everything I need to know. Okay, so what's over here? And then forget it again.

180
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:24,789
And then forget it again and come back a year later and watch the same VATI videos a year later

181
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:31,099
to be like, oh yeah, yeah, that game's great. That story was pretty cool. It's only like a

182
00:26:31,099 --> 00:26:46,150
once a year rotation. Is that a crab or is it a turtle or is that one of those? Oh,

183
00:26:46,150 --> 00:27:10,440
let's just go get it. That was one of those like pus bubbles. Okay, I know they've had a lot of

184
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:17,990
time to see what other like worlds look like and shit, but as much as I talk shit about like some

185
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:22,789
of the stuff that I don't like about, you know, like, oh, the boss is to delay the attack delays.

186
00:27:23,589 --> 00:27:30,390
This is the first time that FromSoftware's made an open world game and it's the actual open world

187
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:39,099
is fucking unbelievable, like un fucking believable. How come companies that have been spending

188
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:53,849
two decades making open world games still can't seem to get it right? I don't get it. It seems

189
00:27:53,849 --> 00:28:00,759
kind of empty. I don't, um, no, I don't think so. I think we see like random camps. We see random

190
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:05,160
shit happen all the time. Um, but just like art, like just artistically, right? Just like the

191
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:10,359
aesthetic of an open world everywhere feels really different and really interesting, but really

192
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:18,140
connected at the same time. It's just, it's, it's just beautiful. It's just amazingly put together,

193
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:28,410
like at least the actual like technical kind of artistic representation. Take a picture.

194
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:48,309
This is a screenshot game. It is. What is this? Glintstone firefly? What is that? Where is it?

195
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:59,690
Material used for crafting items. Glass, now that his tail is a glintstone, it can no longer be

196
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:15,509
eulie potential mates. So it's a, is it crafting material? Dude, whatever. It's a horse. All right,

197
00:29:15,509 --> 00:29:26,259
I'm going to just explore. We're just looking. I know some people said Breath of the Wild. I know

198
00:29:26,259 --> 00:29:33,299
I'm so stupidly just not interested in Zelda. I know, but Breath of the Wild, people are saying

199
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:38,759
like, dude, just please for the love of God, play it. If you think this is good, am I going to be

200
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:42,440
one of those people that plays Breath of the Wild eventually after this and is like, yeah, I'm,

201
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:52,660
that's like one of the best things ever. I don't know why I won't. Yes. Yes. Yes. Nah, nah, nah.

202
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:59,859
Okay. That was like song lyrics. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

203
00:30:01,539 --> 00:30:08,900
Okay. Got another firefly. Anything else here? There's got to be like a little dungeon or

204
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:16,099
something there. That's a fucking lobster. That is a lobster. That's crazy. There's a lobster.

205
00:30:16,819 --> 00:30:21,299
There's always crabs in from software games, but there's never been a lobster.

206
00:30:22,099 --> 00:30:33,990
This is freaking me out a little bit. It's weird. He's got a lot of health. That's crazy.

207
00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:59,589
Oh my God. He's like a pistol sprint. Oh fuck, that hurt. Oh, I thought he was going to be longer

208
00:30:59,589 --> 00:31:12,099
than that. Fuck, he's quick too. He's way faster than the crabs. I think I got to get off the

209
00:31:12,099 --> 00:31:32,579
horse. I think I just got to fight him. Yep. I got to get off the horse. We got to go. You

210
00:31:32,579 --> 00:31:51,880
are fast. Lobsters are not this fast. I'm out of, I'm out of juice. You are as fast as I am on a

211
00:31:51,880 --> 00:32:36,500
horse as a fucking lobster. Get out of here. He's stuck in the ground. All right. We're good. Damn.

212
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:44,259
That was awesome. Oh, probably a fresh lobster claw. Drip of white flesh. Oh, it's actually a

213
00:32:44,259 --> 00:32:56,599
lobster. Cheese lobster. I don't want to have to say this every time I stream this game.

214
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:03,240
Sorcery works until it doesn't. And when it doesn't work, good luck. Cause now you got to

215
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:09,079
fucking use your other weapons like the claw. How many, I would, all the naysayers I'd like to,

216
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:17,589
let's take a minute here. This is Copium. Is it though? I have fought five bosses so far. How

217
00:33:17,589 --> 00:33:24,490
many of them did I use sorcery more than 10% of the time? How many bosses have I fought in this

218
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:31,450
game? And I used melee only and maybe sorcery, maybe like for one or two seconds. Thank you.

219
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:42,900
Thank you, bro. Stop ranting every 30 seconds. Did you see the title of the stream?

220
00:33:43,539 --> 00:33:57,750
What is the title? Oh, right. It doesn't say meltdown every 30 seconds or every 30 minutes,

221
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:10,170
whatever. All right. I need to find a bonfire. Get off the ledge. It's going to fuck with me.

222
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:21,670
Just why did he, that was a weird scream. That was kind of like a goofy scream. Oh, come on. Get

223
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:48,250
out of here. You're going to really piss me off if you kill me. We're just going. Okay. Wait,

224
00:34:48,250 --> 00:35:00,340
wait, wait. We can make them fight each other. Can we? All right. I'm going in a random direction

225
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:10,090
here. I need to take a second. Am I still being chased? Nice. Perfect. Somebody behind me. Perfect.

226
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:17,420
Awesome. All right. Let's get our bearings. There's the academy. And speaking of academies,

227
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:30,440
can we talk about education? So, verified ruins. Ooh, okay. I could probably go down there.

228
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:39,059
I'm going that way. We're going over here. We're going to the ruins. It's definitely like a little

229
00:35:39,059 --> 00:36:06,300
dungeon or something here. Okay. All right. I understand your criticism, right? I get, like,

230
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:12,059
you, I, I get it. I understand. Like the people that are like, oh, you fucking sorcerer. Like,

231
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:16,219
okay. Right here, you can complain, but don't complain during a boss fight because you know how

232
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:43,219
it is. Okay. The ruins are down here. Verified ruins. All right. Let's get this guy out. Where

233
00:36:43,219 --> 00:36:54,780
are you? Why does it sound like he's behind me? Where is he? All right. Let's go, dude. Come on.

234
00:36:55,340 --> 00:37:32,809
Come on. What was that? This thing does crazy great damage. Too slow. Too slow again. Too slow

235
00:37:32,809 --> 00:37:49,980
again, but I didn't get hit by it. I blocked that. I don't know how I blocked that. Is there the

236
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:54,840
backstab technique? Oh, what's the guard one? Maybe I should, should I take a second to figure

237
00:37:54,840 --> 00:38:00,789
out how that works? There's a different parry in this game, right? There's like a guard parry.

238
00:38:00,789 --> 00:38:11,139
How does that work? Yes, there is. Okay. So how does it work? R2 right after guarding.

239
00:38:14,789 --> 00:38:25,510
What? So they gave, they made an easier parry. They made a parry that's like an easy parry.

240
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:35,079
Is that that reliable? Because if that's that reliable, then having a shield and being like

241
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:42,090
heavy armor guy just became like the best way to play this game. Let me try that again.

242
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:55,860
Okay. That's seriously, that's unbelievable. What? Okay. There's somebody behind her.

243
00:38:56,659 --> 00:39:03,369
Why would you ever parry? What's the, why would you ever parry? Does that work on other?

244
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:12,420
Okay. There's no reason to parry in this game. At least normal enemies. If you have a shield.

245
00:39:13,139 --> 00:39:17,849
That's ridiculous. Does it, does it only, wait, does it work on like,

246
00:39:38,389 --> 00:39:53,300
what? I can't, I can't believe it. That's so much stronger than that. Because if you missed this

247
00:39:53,300 --> 00:40:00,539
with the few frames that you can hit it, you're just fucked. It doesn't always break their stance

248
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:14,070
though. So it doesn't work on bosses though, right? There's a huge window for you to be able to do that.

249
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:22,099
What's the downside? There has to be a downside, right? Basic enemies are easy anyways. Yeah,

250
00:40:22,099 --> 00:40:29,579
that's true. I guess that's, you know what? If you wanted kind of to block and be able to parry like

251
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:34,219
that on the kind of normal enemies, I guess that's, it only works really on basic enemies.

252
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:42,309
That's that, you know, that's cool. That's all right. Like maybe some of the harder

253
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:45,269
enemies you can't do it to. Does it take a bunch of stamina? I wasn't really paying attention.

254
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:51,219
Only good in a few circumstances. All right, well, I mean, now that I know that,

255
00:40:51,219 --> 00:40:56,889
why would I ever try to parry a regular enemy ever again? You've seen me do it a bunch of

256
00:40:56,889 --> 00:41:04,039
times in the last three days. There's no point. I'll fight the lobster. I already did. All right,

257
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:14,889
there's, this wouldn't be on the map if I couldn't go down somewhere. Use it on the lobster. You're

258
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:25,349
going to get mocked by everyone if you do it. Okay, so I only do guard parries and the most

259
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:40,090
OP sorcery move. Do I drop to like, do I drop like 80 percent viewership? I'm not going to do that.

260
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:43,369
I'm not going to do that. I'm going to use it if I need to. All right, so where I need to find a

261
00:41:43,369 --> 00:42:02,650
place to go down. This looks promising. There's one of these statues here. What's this? Oh, no.

262
00:42:03,289 --> 00:42:17,110
Come on, there's got to be something to do here. There's 100 million percent of place to go down.

263
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:49,420
What's that? Arry the shrimp or you're a journalist. Come out one and all from the

264
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:58,489
darkness underground and let us offer unto the maiden our eyes. Where are, he's looking for the

265
00:42:58,489 --> 00:43:19,449
underground passage too. It's going to be like a weird spot. I didn't check over here yet. Runes?

266
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:31,619
Tell a joke, funny man. The crowd demands it. Don't demand things from me.

267
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:43,239
Don't, do not demand things from me. Okay, you can highly suggest things.

268
00:43:44,119 --> 00:44:00,920
Do not demand things. Everyone here is allowed one question per year, which I will or will not

269
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:09,190
answer. If any other questions come up during the course of that year, you are using more than your

270
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:28,920
allocated question allowance. It's infuriating. Where is this cave? I'm still technically like in

271
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:34,860
the ruins. Maybe over here. There's got to be a cave. I have to find it. I can't leave without

272
00:44:34,860 --> 00:45:12,969
knowing what's down there. Come on. Where is it? That would kill me, I think. God damn it. It's

273
00:45:12,969 --> 00:45:37,179
right here. Come on. Here, purified ruins. Smashing stone, smithing stone. What are you doing?

274
00:45:37,739 --> 00:45:47,940
I'm looking for it. Oh yeah. Yep, there it is. I just had to fall through the ground.

275
00:45:48,659 --> 00:46:02,340
Hell yeah, let's go. Dangerous looking. What do I touch first?

276
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:08,199
The brewery grape. And this is going to be like a poet. It's going to be like poisonous.

277
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:40,059
Blue fingers heirloom. What is that? What is it? Is it an item? Oh, should I have a golden seed?

278
00:46:40,059 --> 00:46:49,420
Hell yeah. All right, this is the glintstone craftsman expands crafting repertoire.

279
00:46:50,380 --> 00:47:08,809
There it is. Oh, the talisman raises faith. Come on. Everything I've found so far has been for

280
00:47:08,809 --> 00:47:21,690
faith. I'm playing the wrong character. Shit. I keep stumbling upon these ruins and I keep

281
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:37,699
finding items that are awesome and really cool for a different guy. Wait, shit, I need that.

282
00:47:37,699 --> 00:47:48,170
Where is it? Are you being serious? It's literally here. Wait, hold on, dude. I need that item. Where

283
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:58,489
is it? Yeah, let me be your Wikipedia page. It's here. If you go on the loo near a highway

284
00:47:58,489 --> 00:48:07,349
north, it's south, southwest cheater. Oh, come on. Some of you guys that haven't started playing

285
00:48:07,349 --> 00:48:10,949
this game, are you really trying to tell me that after a week or two, you're not going to go find

286
00:48:10,949 --> 00:48:18,070
the item you want to use? I want to make a two handed great sword, a claymore of the depths build.

287
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:24,059
And where is the claymore of the depths? I'd like to go get it right now. Of course you are. Of

288
00:48:24,059 --> 00:48:30,150
course you are. You might, you might do like one or two playthroughs completely blind, right?

289
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:34,949
Right. But like on your second, third and fourth playthrough, you're definitely going to like

290
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:49,130
just look at where the claymore of the depths is. I opened the wiki before I opened the game.

291
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:53,130
There's no shame. No, there really isn't. All right. There's not. If you just want to like

292
00:48:54,090 --> 00:49:00,949
play the game, there's no shame in that. But the wiki doesn't, hell, the wiki doesn't make

293
00:49:00,949 --> 00:49:05,989
you fight the boss better. The wiki just lets you get an item that you know you want.

294
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:16,070
I could tell you where that item is, but I'm not guaranteeing your safety getting it.

295
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:31,739
Okay. We're almost there. Little bit turn around here this way. That's our destination is up there.

296
00:49:33,019 --> 00:49:44,440
Yes, it is. Did you earn it? And did you earn it? I mean, these games are so particular

297
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:48,840
that if you want to build a like faith based character and have like the best,

298
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:52,920
nowhere like the coolest faith based stuff is you're either going to stumble upon it.

299
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,519
Like I just did after at least a handful of playthroughs, right? Or if it's like,

300
00:49:56,519 --> 00:50:00,039
I just want to build a faith character and I want a faith item, where's the nearest faith item?

301
00:50:02,619 --> 00:50:26,780
Shit, these shit, the boys are revolting. I got to get my, where are they? Oh, we just did that.

302
00:50:28,679 --> 00:50:44,630
Oh my God. There's somebody up there with a fucking grenade launcher. Oh, fuck off. I'm

303
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:58,420
getting that guy right now. Get down, get down, get down, get down. They're going to kill you on

304
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:37,659
the ladder. These guys are going to shoot me on the ladder. Watch out for the guy on the top.

305
00:51:37,659 --> 00:51:47,260
All right. We're good. All right. Let's go kill this guy. Maybe this is where I'm going to start

306
00:51:47,260 --> 00:52:18,579
to see. So I forgot him. Ooh, come on, come on. Staff of the deep sea. Shit. Oh, this guy had

307
00:52:18,579 --> 00:52:55,369
like a dragon fruit beard. Look at this guy. Whoa. Is that a, is that a mask or does he actually

308
00:52:55,369 --> 00:53:19,110
have two heads? Oh, we got it. Yay. Oh, I'm so happy. This is fucking awesome. All right.

309
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:25,829
Boost glint blade sorcery staff embedded with a blue glint stone and one of two types of Karen

310
00:53:25,829 --> 00:53:31,110
staff gifted to enchanted nights. It enhances a glint blade sorcery that we are. There's no skill

311
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:38,730
to use this. Oh, that's what I thought. That was making fun of me. Oh, by the way, no skill. If

312
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:50,599
you use this shit loser, I thought that's what that meant. This weapon has no skill, no skill.

313
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:57,429
You use this shit. Okay. All right. Let me see. This is, that's exciting because that's intelligence

314
00:53:57,429 --> 00:54:11,940
C. Let me see what it looks like. We're going to take a look. Ooh, double staff. Hell yeah.

315
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:23,130
What's the difference? So this is, this has been upgraded three times though. So this boosts

316
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:30,219
sorcery. This doesn't, and this is going to start scaling way better. 22 intelligence needed. I'm

317
00:54:30,219 --> 00:54:35,500
just going to take, this is one 26, one 22 for now, just until I go to the blacksmith.

318
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:44,820
We're going to keep using this until I upgrade it. That's really exciting. I'm really happy.

319
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:54,119
Finally, I got like an actual sorcery weapon. Oops, wrong hands. I gotta get rid of some of

320
00:54:54,119 --> 00:55:11,960
this shit. They have too many items. Okay. So that's good. I have too many things in my inventory.

321
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:15,079
All right. For now we're going to keep it because this is still has better scaling because it has

322
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:30,940
upgrades. What is that? What is that down there? Just looking at me. All right. I'm very happy.

323
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:43,159
Let's go. I have to go investigate what that is. Remember you promised you'd never make that sound

324
00:55:43,159 --> 00:55:49,500
ever again. Yeah. And I made it like four times in a row and they were deep and they were excited.

325
00:55:58,119 --> 00:56:00,679
Fall on the horse and jump off. I was kind of scared to do that. I figured it was going to

326
00:56:00,679 --> 00:56:16,230
hurt me. All right. Let me just take one more extra second here. There might be something else here.

327
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:24,860
Highway lookout tower. All right. I know what this is. I'm going to head back. I'm going to

328
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:36,619
upgrade the staff. He's really just embracing himself today, isn't he? Um, I don't know. I'm

329
00:56:36,619 --> 00:56:46,179
just kind of hanging out. Oh, right. We're going to upgrade the hell out of this thing.

330
00:56:57,449 --> 00:57:08,099
You know what else I have that I haven't looked at? I have that painting that I could examine.

331
00:57:08,099 --> 00:57:17,960
Maybe I'll do that too after this. Okay. To the left of the fireplace is where the blacksmith is.

332
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:41,449
Otherwise, I'll forget it every time. Okay. Here we go. Where is it? What's wrong? Can I not?

333
00:57:41,449 --> 00:57:51,909
Additional items required? I only have one smithing stone? Smithing stone one. I only have

334
00:57:51,909 --> 00:58:00,219
one of the- one smithing stone one. Smithing stone two. What's going on? Smithing stone one.

335
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:10,969
I think stone three. Oh, I need more of the little ones. What does that number actually mean?

336
00:58:12,170 --> 00:58:20,300
Smithing stone one. Smithing stone two. Apparently, I have five smithing stone twos, but I have

337
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:32,789
one smithing stone one. It's the level of the stone. Does he sell them? Like one of them or two of them?

338
00:58:32,869 --> 00:58:46,340
No. Well, that's annoying. I'm gonna keep this on balance. Yeah. Okay. Well, oh well.

339
00:58:51,449 --> 00:59:01,480
Sell all your gear. It'll be really funny. Well, we're just gonna keep doing what we're doing.

340
00:59:04,969 --> 00:59:12,469
Different level stones. Do I have enough to level up, by the way? I might have enough of the crunchies.

341
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:21,400
I think I do have enough crunchies to level up. Yeah, I definitely do. It's about 8,000.

342
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:35,739
And I've got to use my flask sieve. That's right. Thanks for the reminder. I would have forgot.

343
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:53,269
I don't get there. I'll be very, very close. 8,000. What does it take? 8,200. Okay. Well,

344
00:59:53,269 --> 01:00:16,150
I'll just go kill like two things. Wait, what? I thought I had one. I need two now? Oh, shit. Okay.

345
01:00:19,019 --> 01:00:31,579
All right. Well, I need to kill like two things. What's going on here? Oh, they're fighting the

346
01:00:31,579 --> 01:00:52,489
ghosts. They're having a fight with the ghosts. Oh, shit. Are they gonna attack me or am I not

347
01:00:52,489 --> 01:01:06,519
priority? Holy shit. This is so, this is absolutely free. I'm such a fucking bad person.

348
01:01:33,059 --> 01:01:45,739
Hell yeah. I got the souls I needed. Just coming in, just unloading. I'll take care of this.

349
01:01:53,079 --> 01:02:05,539
I should have waited. I should have waited until everybody was, uh, oh no. They, oh no. They called

350
01:02:05,539 --> 01:02:14,710
their friend. Hey, help in the barrens, please. There's a level 40 just like killing us. Oh,

351
01:02:14,789 --> 01:02:22,539
all right. I'll handle this. I'm level 50. And then I beat the level 50 as like a 42

352
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:40,440
and it's a fucking huge embarrassment. The guy logs off. What am I doing? Oh, I don't even man

353
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:55,909
off. We're going to go to the bonfire. Where's the fire? Where is it? Oh man. He's got magic.

354
01:02:56,550 --> 01:03:06,389
Okay. He's got magic. Where's the fire? Where's the bonfire? Where's the, where is the fire? I

355
01:03:06,389 --> 01:03:14,409
don't even remember where it is. Person here. Oh, the puppets, the puppets besiege us.

356
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:32,780
There it is. All right. So now I'm not going to mess that up again. I'm going to maybe get health

357
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:47,380
to 18 or dexterity 22. HP probably or mind. What is it? What does it get to? God, to get to 100,

358
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:53,460
it's going to be three, six, nine, 12, 15, 18, 20. It's going to be seven fucking levels

359
01:03:56,260 --> 01:04:07,210
before I can use that guy. You're talking about like 60 plus a thousand souls,

360
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:30,099
all just to summon Oleg to reach a hundred mana at 20. This is going to, I'm going to be so under

361
01:04:31,059 --> 01:04:35,539
my character is going to be so underdeveloped and I'm going to summon this guy and he's going to,

362
01:04:35,539 --> 01:04:39,699
okay, we're going to do this. I'm going to spend the next like 70,000 souls on mind

363
01:04:40,659 --> 01:04:44,659
and Oleg is going to get one hit killed by the next fucking single enemy.

364
01:04:45,699 --> 01:04:57,659
It's going to be such a disaster and it'll be your fault and mine 50 50. We'll split it. Okay.

365
01:04:57,659 --> 01:05:02,380
Let's try this again. It's definitely not magic for that guy because he's a magic. He's made out

366
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:07,820
of the, he's made out of the goo that I shoot out of my staff. So there's no way it's magic. So we

367
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:14,389
have to just kill them with our special moves. I think I'm going to have to get the boys involved.

368
01:05:14,389 --> 01:05:27,139
Let's just, let's just go aggro him because then there'll be a bunch of people here. It'll be an

369
01:05:27,139 --> 01:05:43,849
absolute mess. Okay. It's going to be a mess. Here we go. Like the big guy that's about to

370
01:05:43,849 --> 01:05:54,139
come over here. Dude, do you not see what's over there? Look behind you. Why would you come after

371
01:05:54,139 --> 01:06:00,150
me? There's a guy right there. He's killing everyone. All right. Just follow me. I'm just

372
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:15,500
getting on the voice. All right, come on. Let's go. Is he fighting the other ghosts? He's got a lot

373
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:24,650
of health. What just happened? He's bumped into something. What's wrong with him? What happened?

374
01:06:25,210 --> 01:06:35,079
What? He's just tripped. Oh my God. That was embarrassing. That was really embarrassing.

375
01:06:37,340 --> 01:07:01,510
What happened? Somebody is parrying him. One of them keeps parrying him. No, he's not running

376
01:07:01,510 --> 01:07:08,039
into the wall. He's, one of these guys is parrying his attack. It's this guy. It's this knight with

377
01:07:08,039 --> 01:07:22,090
the shield. Yeah. He's like, come on, do it again. And then I'm going to sneak over there and just

378
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:35,420
hit him in the face. It's definitely a parry. It's absolutely a parry. No, don't kill him. He's

379
01:07:35,420 --> 01:08:24,550
actually very useful. Lock it. Parry. Boys. Let's go. No. Shit. Parry. Come on. Parry him, dude.

380
01:08:24,550 --> 01:09:05,050
Please. Parry him. Parry. Parry. Almost. He didn't parry him. Whoa. I had no stamina.

381
01:09:05,689 --> 01:09:45,979
Fuck. I thought he was done with his moves. Why did he get off the fucking horse?

382
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:57,850
This left stick is bound to crouch, which is a horse left stick. Just

383
01:09:59,050 --> 01:10:04,810
why is there just take the crouch out of the game. It's fucking left stick that I pressed

384
01:10:04,810 --> 01:10:15,210
left stick accidentally. So come on, dude. What the fuck? Do I really have to unbind this shit

385
01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:37,420
every time I start the game? What a pain in the ass. I'm not the only one that's saying this.

386
01:10:37,420 --> 01:11:11,859
I'm not the only one. Oh, okay. Let's go. Stupid ass bullshit. I had it too. It was dumb. All right.

387
01:11:11,859 --> 01:11:21,260
Bring him over here. I have an easy solution. I have an easy solution to the problem.

388
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:27,659
Have crouch be you hold the button for more than one second. Like hold like, okay, crouch, right?

389
01:11:27,659 --> 01:11:32,140
Like that's so easy. Just make it a hold. Make it you make it you hold it for like half a second.

390
01:11:40,890 --> 01:11:54,520
Get him. You'd accidentally press it. Yeah, but you wouldn't hold it. You'd tap it and it wouldn't

391
01:11:54,520 --> 01:13:01,689
do anything. Let's go. Oh my god. He killed me in one fucking hit. I thought he was done with his

392
01:13:01,689 --> 01:13:11,779
moves. I thought he only does one and then two, just three, just a third. This lumbering fuck.

393
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:32,890
First of all, I'm not going to be doing magic on him. So take care of that. First of all,

394
01:13:32,890 --> 01:13:45,319
he jumped into the sword. Well, I jumped in the sword because I didn't know he was doing a third

395
01:13:45,319 --> 01:14:11,989
attack. Spawn this idiot. What was that? Okay, let's go. No more bullshit. Do the strategy.

396
01:14:12,630 --> 01:14:33,060
Did you just kill everybody already? There's so many people to, okay, this is going to be

397
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:38,340
a huge problem. There's so many people to target to lock onto that it's hard to actually get my

398
01:14:38,340 --> 01:15:06,359
targetter on him. Harriet, Harriet. Got him nice. I'm just a seagull at the beach.

399
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:47,720
Any food? Any scraps? I'm just a vulture. Where are my souls? I did the same mistake. I thought he

400
01:15:47,720 --> 01:16:44,729
was going to, okay, here he comes. Good job guys. Go get him. Let's go. Do not get hit by one of

401
01:16:44,729 --> 01:17:06,390
those. Oh, I'm stuck in a rock. I'm on a rock. I'm on a rock. I'm on a rock. I'm on a rock.

402
01:17:07,350 --> 01:17:31,340
This guy is that that boy right there doesn't even know where he is.

403
01:17:32,890 --> 01:18:01,989
That's just Torch Boy. Get out of here. Okay, we get it. You and me. The one survivor.

404
01:18:03,210 --> 01:18:13,380
All right, so what were you protecting down here? He logged out. Obviously, whatever you're protecting

405
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:18,340
in here, there's a reason why you're doing it. What is it? Is it the main road? We're still dark.

406
01:18:18,899 --> 01:18:47,539
Let me take a quick look. Kind of scary. There's definitely going to be a bonfire right here.

407
01:18:48,180 --> 01:19:07,510
All right, where are we? Raya Lucaria, hallowed hall dedicated to the study of magic. Why

408
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:15,590
shut your doors to me? Am I barred from donning the crown of stone? Oh, we're here. This is it.

409
01:19:16,149 --> 01:19:32,409
This is all. This is it. This is the castle of magic is right here. Okay, I could explore,

410
01:19:32,409 --> 01:19:35,770
but not yet. I need to get the bonfire so I don't have to fight that big giant guy again.

411
01:19:51,260 --> 01:20:11,420
Oh, was this place like abandoned? I know. I just walked off the edge, but that doesn't matter.

412
01:20:26,819 --> 01:21:05,159
There's somebody in what appears to be a hot air balloon. What? I don't lock on. It's harder.

413
01:21:09,909 --> 01:21:30,340
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm dead. Oh, that's 5,000 souls. Just got R1 spammed. That's so,

414
01:21:30,979 --> 01:21:39,050
wow, that's so pretty. Where's the big tree? I'm so close to the castle.

415
01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:55,319
It looks like a painting. Are we just going to have to take over?

416
01:21:56,600 --> 01:22:18,579
Well, I don't think so. I think I should be fine. Dude, what the fuck are you doing?

417
01:22:19,939 --> 01:22:26,140
All right. Give me the souls before I die again. All right. So what is it? What the hell is this

418
01:22:26,140 --> 01:22:41,449
thing? Just destroy this? Golden rune. A plus six golden rune. Holy shit. I don't know which way I

419
01:22:41,449 --> 01:23:14,619
should go. There's so many ways to go. Who are these little guys? Who's that? Is that thing alive?

420
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:22,659
Is that thing alive? That thing's alive. Holy shit. They're aiming at me.

421
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:30,859
This guy's face looks like half of every twitch emote I've ever seen.

422
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:53,979
It's like a zoomed in face. God, is that your move? I think I kind of have to take care of this thing,

423
01:23:53,979 --> 01:24:10,710
right? That's the only amount of damage I'm doing to this. I don't think I can really reliably kill

424
01:24:10,710 --> 01:24:37,560
that. This is going to take a long time. They're killing us. What? They're killing us. What? All

425
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:50,539
right. Now I definitely can't get in there. I wonder if they drop anything. Maybe you're really

426
01:24:50,539 --> 01:24:58,810
not supposed to. Maybe you're not supposed to fight it. I don't know. I think that's just kind

427
01:24:58,810 --> 01:25:07,850
of an annoying thing that's here. There's a bunch of them too. Yeah, they're just scattered around.

428
01:25:07,850 --> 01:25:13,210
All right. So I'm going to keep going this way. I'm going to explore over here from the academy

429
01:25:13,210 --> 01:25:45,590
gate town. Is that the academy right there? No. The academy's over here. Lucerne. It's a dex weapon.

430
01:25:47,930 --> 01:26:02,789
Scales mostly with dex. I need 15 strength though. All right. I'm going to go this way

431
01:26:02,789 --> 01:26:12,649
because I'm just going to explore over here for a minute. All right. There's like a little weirdo

432
01:26:12,649 --> 01:26:22,699
guys. All right. I'm going to go over here. I think it's firing the missiles at me right now.

433
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:37,829
Thankfully there's not that much tracking on it. All right. What's over here?

434
01:26:42,260 --> 01:27:15,659
Little hut. What do you got here? I don't know. I got to look at the new armor that I have to.

435
01:27:16,619 --> 01:27:25,670
Silver pickled foul foot. I'm going to keep just going around the perimeter.

436
01:27:28,420 --> 01:27:33,939
And then when I get too far, I'm going to teleport back and level up again because I'm,

437
01:27:33,939 --> 01:28:17,659
I don't want to die here. Garnished golden sunflower. Ooh, alive. No. Wait, what do you,

438
01:28:17,659 --> 01:28:22,140
what's this pot? Why are you guys spamming pot? Is that like a he doesn't know here comes like

439
01:28:22,140 --> 01:28:35,100
the big pot enemy. That's what that is. Yeah. Yeah. It comes up. Oh, he doesn't know. Don't

440
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:41,369
tell him. It comes like the pickles bought. There's going to be like pickled bird feathers

441
01:28:41,369 --> 01:28:46,489
or something, whatever it is that comes out of his spot and it does like poison damage.

442
01:28:47,050 --> 01:29:08,260
It's because you smoke pot. I don't smoke pot slander. Something definitely back here.

443
01:29:54,539 --> 01:30:05,750
Ooh, I got them all. Madam Mano land squirt ashes. Ooh, that's a new, uh, war thing.

444
01:30:08,649 --> 01:30:26,090
I want to just kill all these. Those are new friends. Really? Oh, there's no Mano. Sorry.

445
01:30:27,779 --> 01:30:46,659
It's just free. There might be something else here. I don't care. Nevermind. I lost interest.

446
01:30:53,829 --> 01:30:57,590
What's this potty? It's going to be like the boss or something, right? I'm going to walk over here

447
01:30:57,590 --> 01:31:09,050
and the giant pots going to land up here and nothing. I feel like from software,

448
01:31:09,050 --> 01:31:43,720
put something weird up here, right? It's just cool looking rock or perimeter checking. I'm

449
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:46,840
just checking the perimeter. I'm just going around the edge, just seeing if there's anything here,

450
01:31:46,840 --> 01:32:07,590
any caves, any interesting structures. Okay. There's a new bonfire here all the way in the

451
01:32:07,590 --> 01:32:21,210
edge of this perimeter down here. Okay. I, I'm going to go here in a second, but not right now

452
01:32:21,210 --> 01:32:44,250
because there's so many wolves. You guys are going to get that emo band saying, let's take these

453
01:32:44,250 --> 01:32:50,869
both. He's probably 3000 or a thousand. Hell yeah. All right. So that I might have enough to do it

454
01:32:50,869 --> 01:33:01,180
twice. Oh, this is, I'm going to be so far behind. I'm going to mind. What else does mine do?

455
01:33:01,979 --> 01:33:16,409
What does mine do? It determines FP and affects focus. What does focus do? The resistance to sleep

456
01:33:16,409 --> 01:33:27,029
and bouts of madness. So if I, there's going to be one boss in this game that's a sleep boss and

457
01:33:27,109 --> 01:33:50,699
it's going to be the one that I can actually handle. I don't know. I feel like I kind of need

458
01:33:50,699 --> 01:34:03,210
to level up this after I beat a boss and get like 30,000, 40,000 souls. Imagine the amount of damage

459
01:34:03,210 --> 01:34:08,250
I'm not going to be doing to end up to bosses and enemies though, because I want to have 20 mind.

460
01:34:08,890 --> 01:34:18,470
I think it has to be decks or intelligence at some point as the game starts to snowball in

461
01:34:18,470 --> 01:34:41,939
its difficulty. I can't be like 20 in every stat. Andy do intelligence. I actually might,

462
01:34:41,939 --> 01:35:12,420
let me just go over here. Don't howl. Just come at me and attack me. You got a lot of health.

463
01:35:13,060 --> 01:35:38,250
I don't want to fight any of you. I just want to come over and see if there's any jewels behind

464
01:35:38,250 --> 01:36:02,539
that rock. We back, but what's the, what's the, we're going to figure out what it is and I'm

465
01:36:02,539 --> 01:36:23,590
going to know what it is in like a minute. I don't want to fight you regarding something over here.

466
01:36:23,590 --> 01:36:29,609
What was it? They didn't attack in the pack. I don't know. There's a bunch. All right. I don't

467
01:36:29,609 --> 01:36:34,170
want to, I just want to get through. I don't want to go kill the, all these wolves for no reason.

468
01:36:34,970 --> 01:37:02,920
Anything over here? This is another area. Holy shit. Okay. This is, this game is way bigger than

469
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:19,699
I thought it was. I thought it was like this here. This game is huge. It's huge. All right.

470
01:37:19,699 --> 01:37:35,460
We got to go back. It comes weeks of Elden Ring. Um, I don't know how I'm going to handle this. I

471
01:37:35,460 --> 01:37:46,069
wonder because the game is so massive and there's so much going on. I don't think I have to play

472
01:37:46,069 --> 01:37:57,220
through the entire game in the first six or seven days it comes out. If this truly is a hundred plus

473
01:37:57,220 --> 01:38:21,399
hour experience, I, what's this? I get in here. Well, you just saw as a less than half of the full

474
01:38:21,399 --> 01:38:32,619
map. How did they make this game? How did they do this? This doesn't make any sense. This is

475
01:38:32,619 --> 01:38:57,189
impossible. This is half the map, less than half. What are you talking about? I don't, I can't,

476
01:38:57,189 --> 01:39:11,130
I don't believe it. What you're talking, what you're saying seems almost impossible. What is

477
01:39:11,130 --> 01:39:20,789
this thing? Oh, here it comes guys. Here comes the pot, right? Big open area where nothing is here.

478
01:39:20,869 --> 01:39:36,250
Pots going to land. He's going to put his hand out like, Oh, no, it's just a couple of lobsters.

479
01:39:45,689 --> 01:39:50,310
What are these lights mean? It's just cool looking. Is that actually mean anything?

480
01:39:50,310 --> 01:40:32,600
Where did it go? What? That's not it. That's not the pot. Okay. Well, I don't know where it is.

481
01:40:37,930 --> 01:40:42,890
You guys, it's going to fall on me and it's going to be so anticlimactic now because of your

482
01:40:42,970 --> 01:41:26,199
emote spam. Okay. Boiled prawn shack. This is okay. Cool. Who's this? He's just

483
01:41:26,199 --> 01:41:43,319
boiling a bunch of prawns. What's going on? What are you trying to start something, mate?

484
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:50,630
Just kill him. What the hell is wrong with you? Can I start something?

485
01:41:50,630 --> 01:41:58,810
Piss off before I crack you in half. What the hell is wrong with you? You're trying to start something.

486
01:41:58,810 --> 01:42:22,710
Piss off. Okay. So prawn NPC is, uh, doesn't like me. Maybe I can show up later with something.

487
01:42:23,270 --> 01:43:09,510
Okay. Prawn guy says piss off to me. He's at prawn shack and swamp before academy.

488
01:43:09,510 --> 01:43:35,899
Okay. So what's the point of the bonfire being here? How much further? Okay. This goes this way.

489
01:43:37,029 --> 01:43:40,550
Yeah, that's the academy. I'm kind of going the right way, but why would there be a bonfire

490
01:43:40,550 --> 01:44:00,390
right there? These are alive. This area is so weird. I hate it, but I love it. I hate this.

491
01:44:01,930 --> 01:44:14,409
So fucking weird. So unsettling. Okay. I think I can upgrade staff now. So unsettling to me.

492
01:44:15,670 --> 01:44:21,529
Lobsters and shit. The huge lobsters. Crabs don't really do that to me, but these big lobsters do.

493
01:44:22,489 --> 01:44:56,859
What about over here? Weird little place to go through here. All right. I see something.

494
01:44:57,420 --> 01:45:11,029
Oh, okay. Another one of these. They've been so much better about putting these in places.

495
01:45:14,659 --> 01:45:25,300
They're kind of everywhere. They're everywhere. And the fact that you can just fast travel to

496
01:45:25,300 --> 01:45:37,899
any of them is really actually awesome. All right. More of these crystals.

497
01:45:38,859 --> 01:45:50,460
Maybe I can get some more of these, uh, fireflies. Yeah. This reminds me of fraggled rock. I like it.

498
01:45:51,180 --> 01:45:58,979
Something about shining light, light coming through crystals like this.

499
01:45:59,859 --> 01:46:08,619
I just want to, I just want to eat these. I know what they taste like. It's like blue raspberry,

500
01:46:08,619 --> 01:46:47,739
little crab. There's a lot of this shit over here. There's a huge one. Well, okay. Um,

501
01:46:48,619 --> 01:47:25,640
who's this person? That person's hiding. They not going to stop. Three damage, seven damage.

502
01:47:28,779 --> 01:47:40,090
I don't think I'm supposed to be here unless there's some other way to fight those guys.

503
01:47:40,090 --> 01:47:54,489
Three damage, three damage on a swing, seven damage on sorcery. I want to get a better view.

504
01:47:55,369 --> 01:48:18,380
But what is the purpose of that? Why is that here? That's such a weird thing to be. That's

505
01:48:18,380 --> 01:48:28,439
such a weird thing. Right. That's, this is weird. Why is this here? Two really, really strong enemies

506
01:48:28,439 --> 01:48:32,279
that have a ton of health and a ton of defense. What are they? What's the garden? What are they

507
01:48:32,279 --> 01:49:05,140
guarding? Something here. I don't know. Maybe I'll find out later. Nice. Jesus. Jesus. Where,

508
01:49:05,140 --> 01:49:13,289
where am I going? Geez. Okay. Up here. I don't know what to do. This is ridiculous.

509
01:49:14,329 --> 01:49:18,409
So I don't know what to say. Where do I go? I'm going to go over here. I know I'm not supposed

510
01:49:18,409 --> 01:49:25,399
to be here, but I just want to, what about the, there was a bear. Wasn't there like a bear looking

511
01:49:25,399 --> 01:49:32,100
at me? Where was that? I want to go look at that. I forget what that was. It was near like the

512
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:43,720
watch tower. Let me see. Let me just check a little bit more over here. I'm going to check.

513
01:49:43,720 --> 01:49:51,000
This is a weird building. I'm going to go in there. Wait, I want to look over here first.

514
01:49:52,039 --> 01:50:16,779
This is not poison, right? Items. Here we go. Ice. I think stones. I need these bats. I'm glad I'm

515
01:50:16,779 --> 01:50:25,930
finding them. That's getting angry because he's exploring an open world game. Well, okay. Here's

516
01:50:25,930 --> 01:50:34,279
the thing. It's not just an open world game. It's a from software open world game. That means very

517
01:50:34,279 --> 01:50:41,510
different things. If I was walking around turning on every little like watch tower thing in an

518
01:50:41,510 --> 01:50:46,789
Ubisoft game, then yeah, I'd be like, all right, dude, what are you doing? This is very different

519
01:50:46,789 --> 01:50:53,829
because you can find some pretty crazy shit if you go kind of off the path as we've been at least

520
01:50:53,829 --> 01:50:58,409
proven at least a few times. So if I was walking around picking up like crafting materials and

521
01:50:58,409 --> 01:51:03,239
dying light to be like, all right, like, dude, this is what are you doing? Like we're not going

522
01:51:03,239 --> 01:51:16,569
to find a dungeon to go down and have like an insane encounter. One of the trap chests just sent

523
01:51:16,569 --> 01:51:36,920
me to the final area of the game. Look, I'm just scouting. That's all this is there. And this is

524
01:51:36,920 --> 01:51:43,100
why you scout. This is why you scout. This is going to be an item. It's going to be a weapon or

525
01:51:43,100 --> 01:52:05,670
something. And that's why it's a faith weapon. Nevermind. Fuck this game. Go back here. Okay.

526
01:52:05,670 --> 01:52:15,659
Back here. This is the statue. This is where it was. All right. So let me take a look. This is

527
01:52:15,659 --> 01:52:24,550
where the academy is. That's where I want to go. So I think the play is go on the road,

528
01:52:25,270 --> 01:52:30,949
go straight on the road and head towards the academy. You don't have to justify playing the

529
01:52:30,949 --> 01:52:36,680
game how you want to play it. I mean, look, okay, look, I can understand. Here's the thing.

530
01:52:36,680 --> 01:52:40,199
I can understand if you want to watch like if you want to watch a stream where it's like, all right,

531
01:52:40,199 --> 01:52:43,960
like he's going to go kill the shit and he's going to it's going to be a big intense fight.

532
01:52:43,960 --> 01:52:49,479
He's going to kill everything. Yeah, I know. I mean, the kind of the parts of these games where

533
01:52:49,479 --> 01:52:54,979
you're just kind of like, ooh, a tree. Oh, the sun coming through the tree. What's over here?

534
01:52:56,279 --> 01:53:03,399
Oh, there are weeds here. There are weeds here. Yeah, it's like, all right, dude, I fight somebody.

535
01:53:04,119 --> 01:53:10,039
I get it. Right. But I mean, remember, this is everybody's first time experiencing this stuff.

536
01:53:10,039 --> 01:53:20,649
Right. Obviously, I don't want to run to the next encounter as fast as I can. But I am heading

537
01:53:20,649 --> 01:53:33,979
towards the main objective. Where are these crystals? They're going to have some kind of

538
01:53:33,979 --> 01:53:53,140
significance. Is that OK? I will be really impressed if this actually is in just game space

539
01:53:53,140 --> 01:54:04,119
and that is just there. Is that just kind of a background image or is that actually just

540
01:54:04,119 --> 01:54:10,069
rendered there? And it's there. It's been there the whole time because we've seen that from

541
01:54:10,630 --> 01:54:14,390
very far away. And it just was kind of like a painting. But that's just there.

542
01:54:30,390 --> 01:54:52,420
All right. Finally, I can upgrade my class. Looks like Isaac is one of those statues.

543
01:54:54,970 --> 01:55:38,520
Why is that here? OK, does work so much better. Summon the boys. No, I don't need them right now.

544
01:55:39,159 --> 01:55:54,380
I don't need the boys right now. What's he aiming at? Oh, my God. That's a gun. That's a gun.

545
01:55:54,380 --> 01:56:29,449
I break this so nobody can use it. It's just eating. What are you eating? Just checking. OK.

546
01:56:30,649 --> 01:56:58,039
This is a bad guy up here. That guy looks important. So don't throw that shit at me.

547
01:56:58,039 --> 01:57:09,880
All right, here he comes. Not quite yet. This is the guy. He's waiting for me to get to the top.

548
01:57:09,880 --> 01:57:54,659
He looks dangerous, doesn't he? Let's go. I get that guy way wasn't a big deal. Let's hug the

549
01:57:54,659 --> 01:58:22,810
outside edge here. So this is a main bridge NPC right there. I think that's an NPC. Wait, is that

550
01:58:22,810 --> 01:59:11,659
a lady? I got to clean these notes up. Some of them are not accurate anymore because we

551
01:59:11,659 --> 01:59:35,659
already did them. Snatched it from the big pot. Did you say where it was? Did you say where it was?

552
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:43,399
Nicholas, favor can be yours. Slaughter, slaughter, the all-hearing slaughter.

553
01:59:44,439 --> 01:59:50,600
All you need to do is snatch it from the pot. You didn't say where it is. Where's the pot?

554
01:59:51,239 --> 01:59:59,500
Where's the big pot then? You didn't tell me where it was.

555
02:00:00,380 --> 02:00:09,779
Just said, oh, slaughter pity. I pity you for slaughtering the pot. It's in the pot.

556
02:00:10,500 --> 02:00:41,189
Don't tell me where it is though. It just exists somewhere. Let's hide. Is that it? That's a unit

557
02:00:41,189 --> 02:01:35,109
from Warhammer. That's like Warhammer 40k. That's an Orc mobile. Is that a guy right there? They're

558
02:01:35,189 --> 02:02:09,619
going to see me do this. What? It's got a face. I can't hurt this thing. Okay, never mind. Can I

559
02:02:09,619 --> 02:02:33,380
hit it in the head? Get the boys out here, please. What am I supposed to do about this thing? Jump on

560
02:02:33,380 --> 02:03:17,399
its head? I don't think so. There's a guy right here. God damn, it's a plane jump rope. All right,

561
02:03:17,399 --> 02:03:42,279
die. Can I get in this? Fire blossom. Very cool. All right, let's take a look. That was pretty cool.

562
02:03:42,279 --> 02:03:57,590
You should go get up, Doug. What's up, Doug? They're aiming over here. I'm going to go around.

563
02:04:00,010 --> 02:04:18,470
I'm going to do this very, very carefully because I think there's a couple people back here too.

564
02:04:18,470 --> 02:04:22,710
Yeah, there is. So one by one, I'm going to get these guys from, I'm going to get them from behind.

565
02:04:23,510 --> 02:04:37,579
Nobody else is here. Sneaking through. Wow. Okay, let's do it. Why was that on a backpack?

566
02:04:38,220 --> 02:05:01,180
Fuck. Why? That was, that was clearly right there. That seriously is such a game-changing

567
02:05:01,180 --> 02:05:10,340
thing that you can do. Cool brass shield. Make sure you're not holding forward. Yeah,

568
02:05:10,340 --> 02:05:14,340
I thought I, I thought I was at a complete stop. All right, I'm at, I'm at a complete stop right

569
02:05:14,340 --> 02:05:35,399
here. Maybe the guys that are, if you're holding onto something, maybe you can do it. I have a

570
02:05:35,399 --> 02:05:42,100
talisman that buffs those counters. I actually think I do. Yeah, you're right. Might be worth

571
02:05:42,100 --> 02:06:01,060
putting on probably animation loft. Yeah, that makes sense. Blue white wooden shield. All right.

572
02:06:01,060 --> 02:06:14,659
Let me, I got some new stuff. This is okay. Blue white wooden shield. Small wooden round

573
02:06:14,659 --> 02:06:17,779
shield that has been reinforced with metal. It is light and easy to handle, but cannot offer the

574
02:06:17,779 --> 02:06:25,000
damage negation of a true metal shield. All right. This thing's kind of junk. It's junk.

575
02:06:30,439 --> 02:06:33,880
Brass shield. Although this is better. Oh, I can't hold it. I don't have enough strength.

576
02:06:34,600 --> 02:06:47,000
Wooden gray shield. I can't hold it. This thing has more magic, but I mean, this thing is still

577
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:56,409
good. A hundred percent. Oh, this is blood loss buildup. 50. Maybe I should have that on.

578
02:07:03,289 --> 02:07:12,659
That good? Honestly, this one's still better. Wait, I got some more gear. Okay, let me look at these.

579
02:07:13,779 --> 02:07:17,619
I'm in like magic town, right? So I'm probably going to need to have magic resistance.

580
02:07:19,539 --> 02:07:28,300
What has magic resistance? This does. 10, 11, 12. All right. Let's see this one with this one.

581
02:07:29,020 --> 02:07:42,779
I don't like how that's not, I think this is the one. This one looking for magic resistance,

582
02:07:42,779 --> 02:07:56,420
which this has it. 0.7, 2.7. This one's fine. Look at these. All right. Magic 6.8. These are just

583
02:07:56,420 --> 02:08:03,529
better. I'm going to put these on because this is just kind of better and you lose a little bit of

584
02:08:03,529 --> 02:08:11,100
magic, but it's still pretty good. If you want specific directions to the pot, chat has them,

585
02:08:11,100 --> 02:08:21,579
but it's up to you. Hmm. Let me wander around for another like 10 to 20 minutes and we'll see.

586
02:08:37,109 --> 02:08:59,939
Follow your nose. I think that does it for here. The gate is the front gate. There is a bonfire

587
02:08:59,939 --> 02:09:14,390
here as well. I have a lot of souls. Front door to the academy. Pretty cool. I'm going to level up

588
02:09:21,619 --> 02:09:32,739
this. I finally have a new charge and that's five and two is fine. I want to look at those

589
02:09:32,739 --> 02:09:51,100
new ashes though. Let's go this way. I think I'll have enough. It's going to be close.

590
02:09:52,060 --> 02:10:04,859
What do I need? 9,000. It'll be close. All right. Should I just have chat telling me where it is?

591
02:10:04,859 --> 02:10:24,630
So I don't have to look over here and see this goddamn emote. Okay. Let's check this first.

592
02:10:25,270 --> 02:10:34,229
This looks like it's blocked. Meeting place map. Found a simple map. Check your inventory.

593
02:10:34,869 --> 02:10:55,449
What would it be? Simple map found on a corpse. Seems to point to a meeting place.

594
02:10:57,260 --> 02:11:01,739
Man, it came from surely desired one. The sole means of gaining entry into the academy. A glint

595
02:11:01,739 --> 02:11:15,430
stone key. Bro, where is that? It's in the water somewhere. I can't go in here without a glint

596
02:11:15,430 --> 02:11:27,289
stone key. Shit. All right. I need to find where that is. It looks like it's in a lake or in some

597
02:11:27,289 --> 02:11:41,029
water. I don't have a map of this area. Shit. Wait, let me look at the other thing too. That

598
02:11:41,029 --> 02:11:51,350
painting. Note sold by a merchant imparting knowledge. Someone lurks among the waypoint

599
02:11:51,350 --> 02:11:59,460
ruins on the roads through Limgrave. Work of a wandering artist. Reminiscence of a painting

600
02:11:59,460 --> 02:12:07,369
titled prophecy. Painter is said to have captured the landscapes seen during the last moments of

601
02:12:07,369 --> 02:12:14,170
those welcomed to the death's embrace. So the painter and the vestiges of the dead's last

602
02:12:14,170 --> 02:12:37,420
moments can be discovered by visiting the location depicted. What just ran by the screen? Did you see

603
02:12:37,420 --> 02:12:54,600
that? That wasn't a player's soul. I'm not online. I'm not online. I'm offline. Something just like

604
02:12:54,600 --> 02:13:10,819
went by the screen. Oh man, there's so much stuff. You could spend an eternity. It's like a single

605
02:13:10,819 --> 02:13:18,279
player MMO. Okay. I don't have the map and I don't have the key, but I at least have the spawn point

606
02:13:18,279 --> 02:13:28,340
right there. I have the Lucaria gate, which okay, that's how to get in. I need the key, but I don't

607
02:13:28,340 --> 02:13:32,260
know where the key is because I need to find where the key is. The key is on a map, but I don't have

608
02:13:32,260 --> 02:13:46,500
the map of the area. I'm going to find the map of this area. Interesting stuff. So I'm going to take

609
02:13:46,500 --> 02:13:56,310
a guess that the academy gate town would have a map of the academy gate. I'm just going to guess.

610
02:13:56,869 --> 02:14:07,670
That's where I'm going to go. It was raindrops. Really? I feel like getting like this probably

611
02:14:07,670 --> 02:14:24,329
like a little town here that probably has a map. Let's see if I can find it. I don't think I like

612
02:14:24,329 --> 02:14:32,229
really explored this area here because it's on the map for a reason, right? They wouldn't just

613
02:14:32,229 --> 02:15:01,380
put this here with a marker on the map. Who's that? Is that an enemy? That's an NPC. Oh, it's this guy.

614
02:15:04,229 --> 02:15:04,949
I remember this guy.

615
02:15:23,270 --> 02:15:30,229
The tale of House Hoslo is told in blood. The house here. I, Dielos, swear to deliver the message.

616
02:15:30,869 --> 02:15:38,069
They laid hands upon my servant, Lanya, and I refuse to let the insolent. There's a place to go here.

617
02:15:38,069 --> 02:15:46,149
The tale of House Hoslo is told in blood. I, Dielos. All right, so there's one of these houses

618
02:15:46,149 --> 02:16:01,689
has like a dungeon. Let's find it. Is that, somebody said the map fragments are actually

619
02:16:01,689 --> 02:16:16,729
labeled. Is that, what did that mean? That's the map fragment. Are you serious? So that,

620
02:16:16,729 --> 02:16:24,170
okay, that one's literally right next to the bonfire. That's the map. Yeah. Oh, shit.

621
02:16:24,890 --> 02:17:03,989
They labeled that stone tablets. Where is it? Where is it? Oh, okay. All right. I get it.

622
02:17:04,950 --> 02:17:16,649
A new map. Oh, all right. Okay. I understand that now. Hey, wait, you went to Wikipedia.

623
02:17:17,290 --> 02:17:26,520
I didn't go to Wikipedia. So there's one here too. All right. I'm going to explore this because I

624
02:17:26,520 --> 02:17:41,340
want to see what's here. I've got to find the dungeon in this area because I want to, and I'm

625
02:17:41,340 --> 02:17:53,959
going to. It's going to be a little spot to go. And then he said, make these guys pay for what

626
02:17:54,040 --> 02:18:02,180
they've done. Looking for an entrance of some kind or an underground passage of some kind or

627
02:18:02,180 --> 02:18:12,459
thing of some kind to look at. It's labeled up here. That does not necessarily mean that's where

628
02:18:12,459 --> 02:18:39,030
you go. Or maybe it does. I feel like I'm fairly close. Where are we at? They're underground

629
02:18:39,030 --> 02:19:09,049
somewhere, right? They're under here. Are we here? This looks promising. Shit. Ooh, that's good. Nice.

630
02:19:19,659 --> 02:19:59,639
Hmm. I guess it could be any one of these houses. Drain the lake. What's this? Uh, where's this go?

631
02:20:12,809 --> 02:20:28,100
Holy shit. Okay. Oh, there's a map. Oh my goodness. Okay. So that took me all the way over here.

632
02:20:28,100 --> 02:20:40,360
What is out this? It's a pirate ship. Can I swim? Is there a bonfire over here somewhere?

633
02:20:41,000 --> 02:21:04,440
I want to go to the pirate ship. Wait, this is a bit of this. I feel like somebody made that

634
02:21:04,440 --> 02:21:09,690
in like, I mean, I said a roller coaster tycoon. That's like a roller coaster tycoon setup.

635
02:21:11,159 --> 02:21:15,719
Like, I like made that. Like I had a roller coaster and the roller coaster on top of another

636
02:21:15,719 --> 02:21:21,159
roller coaster and I, I had to make an elevated passage with like a queue going up because like,

637
02:21:21,159 --> 02:21:31,959
that's where the entrance is. That looks so weird. That doesn't look like it should be real. This

638
02:21:31,959 --> 02:21:43,590
dude loves planet coaster. I'm just looking for like the bridge that comes out like this way,

639
02:21:43,590 --> 02:21:47,190
this way, down, down, down, down, that way, that way, that way, down, down, down, that way, that

640
02:21:47,190 --> 02:21:53,780
way, down, down, down. You know what I mean? Like, well, I can't show it to go over to that side.

641
02:21:57,030 --> 02:22:09,370
You're not real. Yes, I am. Okay. So pirate ship. Can I even go over to it? Jesus.

642
02:22:15,510 --> 02:22:35,940
Pirate ship is out here. That's not right. Where am I looking? Okay. Maybe there's a teleport to

643
02:22:35,940 --> 02:22:53,270
it. Well, at least I'll be able to find the, uh, the key now. I don't, I don't care about any,

644
02:22:53,270 --> 02:23:13,719
what is that? What are they pulling a wagon? Are they on the same team? What is that? It's like

645
02:23:13,719 --> 02:23:38,069
the king inside of there. Oh shit. That's so many people. It's fucking terrible. Oh, you hurt. And

646
02:23:38,069 --> 02:23:43,110
of course you jump off the goddamn thing. Of course you do. Yes, of course you do. Why wouldn't,

647
02:23:43,110 --> 02:24:05,739
why wouldn't you accidentally press the left stick? That's cool. I want to, okay. I want to

648
02:24:05,739 --> 02:24:09,909
go back over there because that's actually really cool. I want to see what's going on.

649
02:24:11,700 --> 02:24:28,600
Yeah. This stream is explore stream. Explore until I want to fight a bad guy. I'm not going

650
02:24:28,600 --> 02:24:37,129
to fight him though. I think would probably too low. I want to, I want to see what's going on

651
02:24:37,129 --> 02:24:40,889
inside of that thing. There's probably a weapon or an item or something, right?

652
02:24:41,690 --> 02:24:55,459
I think that has to be. It's so heavily guarded. That's so many people. Okay. Should I just call

653
02:24:55,459 --> 02:25:11,139
the boys and just like run over there and open it? Why can't I call the boys? Why do I feel like the

654
02:25:11,139 --> 02:25:19,770
sheep are part of the crew here? I'm just going to go for it. This is, I feel like I'm playing. Oh

655
02:25:19,770 --> 02:25:23,530
my God. It really is. It really is. There's a chest there. There's actually a chest in the back.

656
02:25:24,170 --> 02:25:33,500
This is worth dying for. Okay. I don't have any souls who gives a shit. I'm just going to jump

657
02:25:33,500 --> 02:25:48,620
on there and open it. I didn't know they were all going to hear it. I thought I had a chance.

658
02:25:52,200 --> 02:26:00,620
I thought I could slowly do the thing that everybody did on dust bowl. Open it. It has to

659
02:26:00,620 --> 02:26:16,809
stop. All right. Stop moving. Come on. I got to rob this fucking thing. Oh my God. I'm going to

660
02:26:16,809 --> 02:26:29,750
get it. Holy shit. It's carrying a night sword. Holy shit. I think that's intelligence. Oh, and

661
02:26:29,750 --> 02:27:07,319
by the way, you thought you could fight me. I'm pretty much a goddamn superhero. Oh, fuck

662
02:27:07,319 --> 02:27:14,840
everybody. Fuck everybody. Get him. Get him. He's hacking. He's a fucking hacker.

663
02:27:16,520 --> 02:27:37,190
Somebody ban him. Ban that guy. Oh, you want to try and ban me? He's a fucking hacker. What the

664
02:27:37,190 --> 02:27:49,180
fuck? He's not even supposed to have that move yet. I had to never have any souls. I don't care.

665
02:27:49,819 --> 02:28:06,600
I got what I came for. Yes. Carrying a night's sword. It's a magic sword. It scales with

666
02:28:06,600 --> 02:28:11,719
intelligence. Scales with intelligence. Say it again. Scales with intelligence.

667
02:28:11,719 --> 02:28:17,239
Do you see that it scales with intelligence? Now I don't have to be Castor Andy anymore.

668
02:28:17,239 --> 02:28:27,370
Well, I will, right? But this is perfect. Dex and int scaling. Keep that in mind. Oh my God. The run

669
02:28:27,370 --> 02:28:47,770
is saved. Oh, look at how pretty it is too. Oh yes. It's actually just a regular ass weapon.

670
02:28:47,770 --> 02:28:54,600
It's a weapon. It has a normal swinging pattern. It's gonna be perfect.

671
02:28:57,139 --> 02:28:59,700
This is the weapon that I have to level up. This is it. This is the one.

672
02:29:02,860 --> 02:29:08,299
Weapon art is that stupid piece of shit, but that's okay. We don't have to be that angry about that

673
02:29:08,299 --> 02:29:27,879
considering. But wait a minute here. What was that? I did it three times. It's a bigger sword and it's

674
02:29:27,879 --> 02:29:42,250
faster. It can block. It's got a big charge. It's just kind of a got a regular swinging pattern

675
02:29:43,209 --> 02:29:49,450
and I can use spells while I use it. I can change it too. Yeah, but actually it might be kind of

676
02:29:49,450 --> 02:29:53,049
good. All right. This is bathroom break time because I actually found the weapon. I'm actually gonna

677
02:29:53,049 --> 02:30:02,790
upgrade. So you gotta make a choice eventually here. This thing looks cool. It's exactly,

678
02:30:02,790 --> 02:30:07,510
exactly what I need for my build. This I'm going to upgrade this weapon to like plus 10.

679
02:30:08,149 --> 02:30:23,780
This is it. Very happy. Finally found one. We would find in faith, faith, faith, fire, faith,

680
02:30:23,780 --> 02:30:29,139
faith, fire, fire, strength, strength, strength, strength, faith, fire, strength, faith. Finally we

681
02:30:29,139 --> 02:30:37,590
run into an int weapon. It's a good one. All right. Key break. I'll be right back. And I'm gonna refill

682
02:30:37,590 --> 02:30:45,049
this. I'll upgrade this sword. Let's go. Please show where that is on the map. For those of you

683
02:30:45,049 --> 02:30:50,170
that actually really want it. It might not be. The databases for the game might not even be there.

684
02:30:50,170 --> 02:31:00,069
So if you really want to know. It was along this road here. I rode down this road. I was looking

685
02:31:00,069 --> 02:31:07,690
for the pirate ship. So here's the pirate ship. So I got, I was up here and I went down this road

686
02:31:07,690 --> 02:31:12,200
here and it was this area here, right? I actually kind of don't remember. Yeah, it was like here,

687
02:31:12,200 --> 02:31:17,340
right here. This is where that is. You want to see it on the bigger map you can.

688
02:31:21,860 --> 02:31:28,870
Right here. This island thing directly left of the island. There's two guys pulling the wagon.

689
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:35,770
Look at how pretty it is. I want to get like a close-up of it. I want it in the light too.

690
02:31:44,459 --> 02:31:52,709
Okay, that would have been so fucking funny. Wait, I gotta get a screenshot for my guild.

691
02:32:03,209 --> 02:32:15,639
No, no, I don't want to rain. Hey, fine. I'll go home. I'll be right back. I'm gonna go upgrade

692
02:32:15,639 --> 02:32:20,899
this thing and I will see you guys in a minute. I won't forget to loop the music this time.

693
02:32:20,899 --> 02:40:05,909
I'll be right back. See, it looped. Looped. All right, let's get back to it. Turn that down. Turn

694
02:40:05,909 --> 02:40:33,690
this up. I want to upgrade. It's time to upgrade. Let's do it. Oh, my drink! Wait, give me a sec.

695
02:40:33,690 --> 02:41:03,799
I left my drink on the counter. Okay, I'm back. I left my drink on the counter. Back to Elden Ring

696
02:41:03,799 --> 02:41:07,159
and I'm gonna take a minute because I want to go upgrade this weapon. If you're just joining us.

697
02:41:07,799 --> 02:41:16,139
Holy goodness, we got some good news. I finally found a weapon called the Carrion Knight Sword.

698
02:41:16,139 --> 02:41:23,030
It scales with strength, dex, and intelligence, which eventually here after a few upgrades could

699
02:41:23,030 --> 02:41:29,590
turn out to be a very big deal. Very cool sword. I wonder how the scaling changes after a few

700
02:41:29,590 --> 02:41:51,190
stone upgrades. Let's go find out. What's on the shirt? It's an Andy Mark shirt. Whatever floats

701
02:41:51,190 --> 02:42:02,979
your goat. Andy Mark. Okay, left in the fireplace. I remember this time. There's actually I think

702
02:42:02,979 --> 02:42:12,040
is there a new NPC here? I swear I just saw one. The decision is final. I have to pick something.

703
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:18,920
I can't just bounce around anymore. Here we go. Upgrade this thing. I can't. Why?

704
02:42:20,360 --> 02:42:34,090
Why not? I have zero dollars. Wait, come on. Why? I have to go sell something to that lady.

705
02:42:34,809 --> 02:42:46,020
Where are you at? You're down here, right? Yeah. I'm gonna call them dollars.

706
02:42:46,579 --> 02:43:11,510
I want to sell. Who can I sell to? Who can I sell to? Who's who can I sell to? Can I sell to the

707
02:43:11,510 --> 02:43:21,129
blacksmith? Forget. I can. I'm an idiot. All right, I need I just need like a few hundred.

708
02:43:21,850 --> 02:43:28,700
I don't know what any of this shit does. Crafting. I gotta learn this. All right,

709
02:43:28,700 --> 02:43:44,760
we're taking a minute. I know this filler episode here. Okay. Field. It's time to get

710
02:43:44,760 --> 02:43:48,840
rid of some of this stuff. I'm not going to use the short sword to sell it. I'm not going to use

711
02:43:48,840 --> 02:43:54,360
the long sword. This thing. No, sell it. Touch that. I'm not going to. I have two daggers.

712
02:43:54,360 --> 02:44:06,709
Just give me one. I'm not going to use the stock. Wait, wait, what? I'm not going to use the axe.

713
02:44:07,590 --> 02:44:15,739
I'm not going to use the loose yarn. I'm not going to use this either. And it's worth a lot.

714
02:44:16,139 --> 02:44:24,540
But I'm scared to delete it. Okay, here we go. So this is going to be 88. Now it's 100.

715
02:44:24,540 --> 02:44:31,159
That's so much better. And go. I need somber smithing stones to keep this going.

716
02:44:37,780 --> 02:44:44,950
Oh, yeah. So if you I gotta make sure I wait. No, I already have them, bro. I already got them.

717
02:44:44,950 --> 02:44:57,000
Let's go. I just need runes. All right. All right. Just kill two people. I'm just gonna go just

718
02:44:57,879 --> 02:45:06,420
lay these people out. It gives us an opportunity to test the sword as well.

719
02:45:06,420 --> 02:45:12,299
See how much damage it does, because it's probably going to do a lot. All right. It's going to find

720
02:45:12,299 --> 02:45:31,700
a group of people to kill. Shouldn't be too hard. Yeah, like this guy. 150 fucking seven

721
02:45:31,700 --> 02:45:44,489
damage. And this shit ain't even upgraded. Over 100 damage. I need like probably two or three

722
02:45:44,489 --> 02:45:53,579
thousand souls. Is that OP? Well, it's not necessarily because I'm build. I'm I'm look at

723
02:45:53,579 --> 02:46:04,069
my build. This is exactly what I was looking for. This item was made for me. All right. How

724
02:46:04,069 --> 02:46:13,510
is it on horseback? Awesome on horseback. Yep. Perfect. What is this thing? I don't know. It's

725
02:46:13,510 --> 02:46:30,899
gonna die. Whatever it is. Feed my rune appetite. I can just doesn't matter. I can just be poisoned.

726
02:46:30,899 --> 02:46:39,079
It's fine. Now I'm going to be a force to actually be reckoned with. Bosses now are not going to be

727
02:46:39,079 --> 02:46:45,159
a weird combination of meeting to dance around and do like 40, 50 damage a swing to everybody.

728
02:46:45,879 --> 02:46:57,500
I don't have this poison. No more meltdowns. Got it. Let's go kill a lobster.

729
02:46:59,100 --> 02:47:04,659
Because once I get this a couple more like plus two plus three plus four,

730
02:47:05,299 --> 02:47:41,020
it's going to be like where I'm supposed to be. Just spit me get that. What are you doing? What's

731
02:47:41,020 --> 02:47:51,260
it? Why is he standing still? I mean, that's cool, but he's a lobster. So it didn't really hurt.

732
02:47:51,819 --> 02:48:19,690
How would you ever fight this guy? Not on a horse.

733
02:48:21,610 --> 02:48:25,340
Literally looking at chat in the middle of riding around on the horse.

734
02:48:26,219 --> 02:49:10,500
Wrong spell. How much is that worth? It's like a thousand. All right. 500. That's it.

735
02:49:19,379 --> 02:49:23,379
So it's 400. Then it's probably going to be like 800. So I need another like 500.

736
02:49:27,850 --> 02:49:37,639
No skill. Oh, you could just go. Yeah. The giant dogs fight again. Yeah. I could go to the,

737
02:49:37,639 --> 02:49:52,170
that's a good, uh, farm spot. I'll do that real quick. Where is it down here? Right. Where was

738
02:49:52,170 --> 02:50:00,979
that? Which one of these was it? Not the crystal tunnel. It's this one down here. Yeah. There's a

739
02:50:00,979 --> 02:50:09,579
map right there as well. I'll get them up. Yeah. All right. This is the farm zone right here.

740
02:50:10,540 --> 02:50:43,319
Map is over here. Let's market and start the battle. Attack. Yes. I am the master of chaos.

741
02:50:43,959 --> 02:51:05,049
I am the master of chaos. Muahaha. Muahaha. I am the master of chaos. Oh, big move.

742
02:51:05,850 --> 02:51:21,750
I've got a question. How many of you guys hate watching me? But you're still here because you

743
02:51:21,750 --> 02:51:42,569
think it's kind of fun to do that. What was that lunge dude? 11,000 hate watchers. Oh, that was

744
02:51:42,569 --> 02:51:47,290
like, I would, I don't know. I don't want anybody to like hate me. That like sucks.

745
02:51:48,090 --> 02:52:23,510
I got his shorts on. This is your prize for getting a nice parry. Damn. All right. That's

746
02:52:23,510 --> 02:52:32,540
definitely enough. I can move. Yeah. That's good. Wait, actually, there's a little bit more over

747
02:52:32,540 --> 02:52:52,729
here. How much health do they have? Yeah, I might as well. This is how I actually felt when I was

748
02:52:52,729 --> 02:52:56,170
playing like MMO PVP, by the way, like I didn't even know what was happening. I didn't know what

749
02:52:56,170 --> 02:53:01,989
I was doing. I would just cast like random moves. I would just attack random people.

750
02:53:02,950 --> 02:53:16,180
I feel like I wasn't doing very much, but I was kind of there helping. I wonder like, okay,

751
02:53:16,180 --> 02:53:20,739
altered Valley. That's because I played well. I think it was actually like five people actually

752
02:53:20,739 --> 02:53:25,860
playing the game and then like 35 other people just, just walking in random directions.

753
02:53:27,799 --> 02:53:32,360
I remember people being lost that just weren't even part of the fight. They were just like

754
02:53:32,360 --> 02:53:38,659
walking around doing stuff. They didn't even know where they were. Odd. I remember. Oh, the map,

755
02:53:38,659 --> 02:53:52,760
right? 40 man raids and wow. What a disaster. I remember there were cases of people showing

756
02:53:52,760 --> 02:53:59,879
the DPS meter be like, um, Hey dude, like it says here on the DPS meter that you're only doing

757
02:53:59,879 --> 02:54:06,459
just auto attacks. You're not even doing any moves like just completely just not even playing.

758
02:54:06,459 --> 02:54:12,819
Like you're just there doing the encounter and just not playing like, Hey man, uh, it says you,

759
02:54:12,819 --> 02:54:19,860
you did like 1400 damage across the whole fight, which is actually impossible unless you have only

760
02:54:19,860 --> 02:54:37,159
been doing auto attacks. All right. I gotta go this way. Oh my God. I got an entire zoo behind me.

761
02:54:37,159 --> 02:54:50,520
What the fuck? Give me the map. Oh my God. Get away from me. Stop guarding the thing. I want

762
02:54:50,520 --> 02:55:04,489
get out of the way. I got it. It looks like a puppet. Looks like there's a hand in there.

763
02:55:12,059 --> 02:55:21,659
Sesame Street. Okay, dude, that's enough. I've had enough. I teleport. No.

764
02:55:44,700 --> 02:55:54,950
A new map has been found. Whoa. Those are my souls right there. Right. Where the fuck are they?

765
02:55:56,149 --> 02:56:04,809
My souls are right there. Upgrade your flask. I already did. I did say goodbye to those souls.

766
02:56:04,809 --> 02:56:12,139
They're not gone. They're right here. We should say goodbye to is that that attitude.

767
02:56:12,860 --> 02:56:21,829
Where is it? I wasn't even an attitude. That was just telling me what was happening.

768
02:56:34,229 --> 02:56:45,930
Get off my stop camping. Fine. You want to play that game? We can play that game. What is this?

769
02:56:46,649 --> 02:57:14,059
I didn't want to give a camping my body. Let's get the hell out of here.

770
02:57:21,209 --> 02:57:36,819
Good. I have enough souls. I can upgrade this probably three times. Maybe twice. Cheesing is

771
02:57:36,819 --> 02:57:52,709
so fun. What is more cheese? Casting spells at somebody or somebody camping. 113. Here we go.

772
02:57:53,750 --> 02:58:05,879
Boom. I can do it again. Boom. I can do it again. Oh, this is it. I've been saving these stones.

773
02:58:06,440 --> 02:58:20,709
I have four. I have one somber smithing stone. Hell yeah. Look at that. This thing is good shit

774
02:58:20,709 --> 02:58:33,180
now. Plus four. Boom. There it is. Boom. That's so funny. Should I start saying that? Should I

775
02:58:33,180 --> 02:58:42,979
start saying that? Boom. There you go. I wonder if maybe does it stay at D? Will it scale D the

776
02:58:42,979 --> 02:58:47,659
whole time? Sometimes they get higher. So maybe one of them will turn to C.

777
02:58:51,030 --> 02:58:54,469
Now, I mean, it's not the stupidest idea now to put some points in strength,

778
02:58:55,030 --> 02:59:01,780
but probably not because just have it scale with intelligence and dexterity.

779
02:59:02,579 --> 02:59:22,139
Because that just makes my casting better too. What about the wand? Where is it? I'm going to

780
02:59:22,139 --> 02:59:36,469
check out the other ashes thing. Okay. So I'm comfortable putting this on now. All right, dude.

781
02:59:37,430 --> 02:59:47,659
And this gets to be scaling when I do this. Here we go. Boom. Have I been saying boom?

782
02:59:53,989 --> 02:59:56,950
Have? I've been saying boom. I've already been doing that.

783
02:59:58,389 --> 03:00:19,059
If I really know I have. I've been saying boom. So that should even out look at my cool stuff.

784
03:00:19,059 --> 03:00:22,739
I still look like an asshole though. I need some better stuff. I need some cooler like

785
03:00:23,540 --> 03:00:33,620
armor. I look like I look like trash. I look awful. I need to match these cool new items

786
03:00:33,620 --> 03:00:38,540
that I have for this cool build. I'm ready to tackle this next part, which is we're going to

787
03:00:38,540 --> 03:00:57,049
find the key, which if I look at the map that I have in my inventory, it's like in the middle

788
03:00:58,420 --> 03:01:02,020
is an island to the left. There's a little island to the right. There's a small little

789
03:01:02,020 --> 03:01:12,260
kind of peninsula that sticks out. It's underneath that. Okay. It's right here.

790
03:01:12,899 --> 03:01:23,290
This is where the glint stone key is. We're going to go get it. What was this marked for?

791
03:01:23,290 --> 03:01:54,469
I don't know. Get rid of it. This is better than Bloodborne. Bloodborne is like my favorite

792
03:01:54,469 --> 03:02:02,629
single player game ever. Bloodborne is my favorite single player game ever. Besides maybe

793
03:02:03,510 --> 03:02:15,510
all that thought. Hold on to it. All that thought because it's tough. I think it's hard to let go

794
03:02:15,510 --> 03:02:28,200
of something that you find so dear, right? But how I about D. You've completed 8% of the game.

795
03:02:28,200 --> 03:02:30,280
You can't rate it yet. That's kind of why I'm saying that.

796
03:02:32,659 --> 03:02:39,370
Afts have since diverged, never again to cross. Though that's hardly an uncommon fate for two

797
03:02:39,370 --> 03:02:47,959
friends. D. was telling me that he discovered the mark of the centipede. The centipede is an ancient

798
03:02:47,959 --> 03:02:53,959
symbol of the curse mark. As long as whoever finds and uses it is not nefarious by nature,

799
03:02:53,959 --> 03:02:59,079
then we may be able to form an alliance. Okay. If only I could speak to them in person and if they

800
03:02:59,079 --> 03:03:06,760
were like you, all the better. I want your outfit. How hard is that? I want this person's outfit.

801
03:03:07,559 --> 03:03:14,950
Okay. I have enough to get both of these, which I'm going to.

802
03:03:16,229 --> 03:03:27,319
Just to have them. Let's take a look. I got to go to the blacksmith and see if I want to

803
03:03:27,319 --> 03:03:42,569
put something else on this sword. Cause this is... All right. It's time for the ultimate

804
03:03:43,610 --> 03:03:47,290
hot take. Well, not really. This is like actually probably not an unpopular opinion right now.

805
03:03:47,850 --> 03:03:56,219
It's kind of feels like every from software game combined into one game. It's every single

806
03:03:56,219 --> 03:04:00,700
from software game. They just mushed them all together and just kind of made it. They've

807
03:04:00,700 --> 03:04:08,780
polished it up. The one thing that's missing that I like from Bloodborne is I like having a ton

808
03:04:09,899 --> 03:04:15,420
of Bloodborne's heels were instant. Being able to just be like wham and you're and you're healed

809
03:04:15,420 --> 03:04:21,340
like 30, 40% was just so I like that system. But I mean, I didn't really love the system of having

810
03:04:21,340 --> 03:04:30,180
to go collect them if you didn't have any, but I like the speed of Bloodborne being able to,

811
03:04:30,180 --> 03:04:34,899
my character being able to move around like crazy was one of my favorite parts of Bloodborne

812
03:04:36,790 --> 03:04:41,590
and the trick weapons. Yeah. The trick trick weapons were probably, I mean, you can't really

813
03:04:41,590 --> 03:04:48,010
do that with the probably a hundred plus items that are in this game. Trick weapons, the actual

814
03:04:48,010 --> 03:04:57,059
theme and the story of Bloodborne and the speed. That's why it's above everything for me. But

815
03:04:58,780 --> 03:05:02,620
I just, it's hard not to like this because it just how much stuff you can actually really do

816
03:05:06,680 --> 03:05:10,120
is that when I play Bloodborne again, I know where I'm exactly where I'm going.

817
03:05:11,500 --> 03:05:17,020
I know what I'm doing. I know I'm going to go to, okay, we're in central Yharnam. We're going to go

818
03:05:17,020 --> 03:05:21,340
to now we're going to go. Okay. We're going to Bergen worth. Okay. Now we're doing the swamp.

819
03:05:21,340 --> 03:05:26,459
Like it's the same exact game pretty much every single time. It's incredible. It's amazing. And

820
03:05:26,459 --> 03:05:32,500
it's a ton of fun, but it's the same experience almost every time. I feel like this is going to

821
03:05:32,500 --> 03:05:43,159
be a completely wildly different experience. No matter how you play this. I mean, I could just,

822
03:05:43,159 --> 03:05:51,110
I mean, it's holy, but it doesn't, I can put it on if I wanted to standard or sacred.

823
03:05:56,069 --> 03:06:03,819
All right. Can I not take it off my weapon? Is this on here permanently?

824
03:06:11,909 --> 03:06:24,090
Can I not put a weapon on this? It's on there permanently. Okay. You can go sit down to change

825
03:06:24,090 --> 03:06:34,629
it. Oh, cause it's like a, but yeah, I mean, it's the, uh, everything of every time. Okay.

826
03:06:34,629 --> 03:06:44,219
Think about this. There are, from what I've been told, an absolutely unbelievable amount of things

827
03:06:44,219 --> 03:06:49,899
to do in this game. There are spoiler alert because I heard this just by kind of browsing

828
03:06:49,899 --> 03:06:54,700
around and seeing stuff. There are apparently, and there's a spoiler for this game, but not,

829
03:06:54,700 --> 03:06:57,899
it's not really a spoiler, but it's just, it's like, it's about like the content of the game.

830
03:06:57,899 --> 03:07:03,290
If you don't want to hear it mute for five seconds, there apparently are almost 100

831
03:07:03,290 --> 03:07:20,459
fucking bosses in this game. A hundred, 100, not 15, not like 30, fucking a hundred. When I heard

832
03:07:20,459 --> 03:07:26,180
that I, and then when people were saying, Oh dude, no, no, no, no, you're not even, this is like,

833
03:07:26,180 --> 03:07:32,680
not even half the map. It's just like, really? Like I, I looked forward so much to like the game,

834
03:07:32,680 --> 03:07:39,959
the DLCs for dark souls three, for bloodborne, they added like 10 to 20 hours of content and

835
03:07:39,959 --> 03:07:44,360
like what, like six or seven bosses. It was like, holy shit. Yeah. Cause the main game had like,

836
03:07:44,920 --> 03:07:55,110
what, 15 to like 20 actual bosses. Thinking about a hundred boss encounters and only like,

837
03:07:55,110 --> 03:07:59,190
I believe only like five to 10 of them are reskins of like enemies are in the game.

838
03:07:59,190 --> 03:08:07,610
They're all like unique encounters. It's 83. Come on, dude. I mean, still, you don't think

839
03:08:07,610 --> 03:08:14,280
they're going to do DLC for this game and bring it to like 100, 110, way more than 10 are reskins.

840
03:08:17,209 --> 03:08:23,370
Only 83. LOL. 83 is still, even if there is like slight reskins and stuff, but that's still,

841
03:08:26,010 --> 03:08:29,930
I read that there's at least 50 unique encounters somewhere. 74 unique ones,

842
03:08:29,930 --> 03:08:34,489
according to a chatter. That's ridiculous. That's more people that are in smash brothers.

843
03:08:35,510 --> 03:08:41,610
That's, that's bigger than the smash brothers roster at this point. So that's, I mean,

844
03:08:41,610 --> 03:08:50,500
that's crazy to think about that there's that much stuff to do. It's almost overwhelming,

845
03:08:50,500 --> 03:08:56,170
which is why I'm trying to, we're taking a little bit of time here on this stream to kind of slow

846
03:08:56,170 --> 03:09:03,209
it down a little because it's, it's very overwhelming being able to kind of go anywhere. And there's so

847
03:09:03,209 --> 03:09:10,139
much stuff to explore that I kind of want to like, let's slow it down a little. Yeah, that's,

848
03:09:10,139 --> 03:09:20,709
that's ridiculous. So anyways, there's my, as it stands right now, this is probably at this point

849
03:09:20,709 --> 03:09:25,110
right now, I have to see some of the more, some more bosses, especially the main story ones.

850
03:09:27,530 --> 03:09:33,399
But this is like, if you talk about the brackets, like Bloodborne is like really like desperately

851
03:09:33,399 --> 03:09:38,360
like reaching to grab at the heels of this game right now, at least in the first like 10 to 20

852
03:09:38,360 --> 03:09:49,180
hours of both experiences. Because I did not feel that way about Sekiro. Let me be really honest.

853
03:09:50,709 --> 03:09:59,350
Sekiro was good, was really cool. But Sekiro was just a lot different. And it was kind of,

854
03:09:59,350 --> 03:10:04,500
it was a little much for me too. I find Sekiro to be like the hardest game I think I've ever played.

855
03:10:06,739 --> 03:10:10,870
Just because of the amount of like the parry, parry, parry, parry, parry, parry, parry, parry.

856
03:10:10,870 --> 03:10:15,350
Like the bosses that had like five phases, it was really, really, really a lot.

857
03:10:16,950 --> 03:10:21,879
So I think this kind of sits in a spot that I like. We'll see.

858
03:10:22,520 --> 03:10:28,950
Are you the kind of person that tries and completes every dungeon and side quest in an area?

859
03:10:29,909 --> 03:10:33,909
Not particularly, but I love the fact that it's there. Because if I play this game again,

860
03:10:33,909 --> 03:10:43,670
which I'm absolutely going to, instead of doing like this, I could do like this, or like this,

861
03:10:44,469 --> 03:10:48,040
or this. I don't have to follow the exact same path. Even if I want to come back here, right?

862
03:10:48,040 --> 03:10:52,520
This stuff I haven't done. The fact that it's available means you can replay it more than a

863
03:10:52,520 --> 03:11:03,000
few times and see stuff you've never seen before. I think it's great, but I'm holding my tongue a

864
03:11:03,000 --> 03:11:07,719
little bit just because I don't want to be one of those people that's like, this is definitely the

865
03:11:07,719 --> 03:11:12,040
best game ever made. It has to be. Nothing can compare. And then like the next three,

866
03:11:12,040 --> 03:11:17,239
four main story bosses I talk about like, these suck. This game sucks. I don't want to like kind

867
03:11:17,239 --> 03:11:24,440
of jump the gun on this a little, but it does kind of feel like it is one of the better single

868
03:11:24,440 --> 03:11:32,700
player experiences I've ever had. Especially in the first like 10 to 20 hours. Because I know

869
03:11:32,700 --> 03:11:37,879
how much there is to do. You do that for every game though. So that's okay. Yeah. Oh, Resident

870
03:11:37,879 --> 03:11:43,159
Evil 8. I just make, I just talk shit about every game I play. It's a coping mechanism. Don't you

871
03:11:43,159 --> 03:11:47,799
get it? You understand by now? Like I don't actually hate these games. It's just for my brain.

872
03:11:47,799 --> 03:11:53,959
My like ego maniac brain is like, it's there's no way it's you're the problem. Tell them. Tell

873
03:11:53,959 --> 03:11:59,959
them it's not you. Tell them to unbind left stick. Yeah, unbind left stick. And also tell them to

874
03:11:59,959 --> 03:12:05,530
eat that broccoli too, because it's got full of vitamin K. Eat broccoli. It's good. And also

875
03:12:05,530 --> 03:12:11,370
tell them that this boss is too slow. Like I, of course it's like, that's like ego, right? Like,

876
03:12:11,370 --> 03:12:15,930
no, it's not me. It's fucking, it's not me. It's the game's fault that I wasn't able to do that.

877
03:12:15,930 --> 03:12:19,610
But like it's, it's cope. You're coping with the fact that you're not doing something as fast as

878
03:12:19,610 --> 03:12:28,520
you want to. Play the game already. I'm giving you, I've played the game for like 20 hours and I'm

879
03:12:28,520 --> 03:12:36,069
giving you how I feel about the game. I'm a reviewer of video games. Play the game so much of you.

880
03:12:36,069 --> 03:12:40,389
Play the game if you like it so much. I'm reviewing this game. People come to me and they look for

881
03:12:40,389 --> 03:12:45,879
their, their, how they feel about games. This is where they come. They come in and they say,

882
03:12:45,879 --> 03:12:52,790
what does he think about it? What does he have to say? How does he feel about this? We need to know.

883
03:12:52,790 --> 03:13:13,799
Where are those ashes? There it is. No, I think that's on there permanently guys.

884
03:13:14,680 --> 03:13:23,399
It is. I cannot take that off. That's the downside to that weapon. That's all right. Here we go.

885
03:13:23,399 --> 03:13:26,760
We're going. We're going. We're going. We're going. Fine. Fine. Play the game. Play the game.

886
03:13:26,760 --> 03:13:40,379
Play the game. Play the game. Play the game. Usually you play something like Fart Simulator

887
03:13:40,379 --> 03:13:51,850
2013. We're not used to your like takes on video games. So let me test this out. What's the, how

888
03:13:51,850 --> 03:13:58,569
do I get to do the weapon art for this? Can I, I can't cause it's in my hand. What about this?

889
03:14:00,280 --> 03:14:04,329
Does it have to be my right hand? Cause that's like the spinning shield thing.

890
03:14:17,370 --> 03:14:30,780
Y and L2. That was stupid. This is a magic trick.

891
03:14:35,350 --> 03:14:39,110
See, there are no strings where I'm attached. There's nothing, no strings on my arms.

892
03:14:39,829 --> 03:14:56,659
Okay. Well that was, that was dumb. It's a pretty cool party trick though. Yeah.

893
03:14:56,659 --> 03:15:01,540
All right. Let's get on the horse. We're going. It's this way. We're going to marker number three,

894
03:15:02,260 --> 03:15:07,780
play the game already. We don't want to hear you talk. We want to see you play and talk.

895
03:15:08,899 --> 03:15:16,069
Do two things at once and hurry up. My food's almost here and I want to be able to eat

896
03:15:16,870 --> 03:15:20,389
my cheese pizza while you're playing this game and you're wasting time.

897
03:15:21,190 --> 03:15:29,049
I've been waiting, sitting with a pizza in front of me and it's getting cold.

898
03:15:29,930 --> 03:15:34,090
I won't eat one bite until you start riding on the horse. Hurry up.

899
03:15:43,139 --> 03:15:49,700
So you said I'm doing that now? Dude, my pizza is cold now.

900
03:15:49,860 --> 03:16:00,299
You slam your fucking hands on your desk. All right. This is weird. What's going on here?

901
03:16:00,299 --> 03:16:24,420
These are those things that give spells and ashes of work. This is actually just kind of like a

902
03:16:24,420 --> 03:16:31,690
jackpot. It is not. Okay. I didn't know. I was thinking maybe this is like a jackpot.

903
03:16:38,020 --> 03:16:50,360
There's something over there. I don't know what that is. Is it a dragon? That's a sleeping dragon.

904
03:16:51,079 --> 03:17:24,409
Oh shit. Did you hear me? I didn't hear me. Smarg. Glintstone dragon smarg.

905
03:17:26,889 --> 03:17:35,079
It's in that kind of like, in that dragon. What? Well, here we go. Another dragon fight. We all

906
03:17:35,079 --> 03:17:50,629
love these ones. Actually, can I do this? Breathe fire. Oh, he breathes glintstone fire.

907
03:17:58,069 --> 03:18:15,670
Holy shit. It's like super missiles. I have no mana. I have no, I have no, I have no run mana.

908
03:18:24,389 --> 03:18:39,500
I can't call, I can't call the boys either. There's a fire right here too.

909
03:18:40,299 --> 03:18:59,579
I think I'm going to try the punch. I'm going to try a right, right trigger attack. Heavy attack.

910
03:19:00,299 --> 03:19:13,059
There he goes with this bullshit and he goes wham. I don't think it's much better. I think

911
03:19:13,059 --> 03:19:46,409
he's going to stick with what I'm doing. Stick with it. You shoot behind him. Don't be greedy.

912
03:19:47,049 --> 03:20:08,870
Wait, that's why I didn't want to do that. Does he have no eyes? Oh, that was an epic scene.

913
03:20:09,430 --> 03:20:42,809
Oh, it's coming. Button press on my keyboard. Button press. Didn't unbind it.

914
03:21:25,579 --> 03:21:35,540
Don't swipe your tail at me. Don't even think about it. Oh, you ugly.

915
03:21:36,180 --> 03:22:26,979
Holy shit. He killed me in one hit. One hit. Well, maybe I need more health.

916
03:22:26,979 --> 03:22:36,549
I don't get one hit killed by that. I'll come back to him. That's really cool. I'll come back to him.

917
03:22:46,790 --> 03:22:58,090
There's the bear. I found the bear. That was such a shitty reveal. I wanted to like actually see the

918
03:22:58,090 --> 03:23:21,399
bear. Is that too far? That's not. All right. Come here. Where are you? That was a cool thing

919
03:23:21,399 --> 03:23:30,219
that we were just doing. There's a gorilla? No, it's a bear. It's like a bear gorilla.

920
03:23:30,219 --> 03:23:48,459
I'm sneaking behind you. What's the point of a sneak in this game? Dude, there's so many

921
03:23:48,459 --> 03:24:27,059
fucking giant creatures. Oh my God. Wait, where's that taking me? What the hell am I? I don't want

922
03:24:27,059 --> 03:24:36,090
to be here. Oh, I was supposed to go get the key. All right. All right. Well, I mean, I literally

923
03:24:36,090 --> 03:24:39,129
can't even hurt these people. So we're going to have to come back later. I need to go get the key

924
03:24:39,129 --> 03:25:12,069
to go in this way. Okay. Very cool. Let's go. Pull the dragon's glint stone dragon.

925
03:25:12,950 --> 03:25:18,389
I have a big feeling that that dragon drops something that I would be very interested in

926
03:25:18,389 --> 03:25:26,120
acquiring. Can't sneak around. I don't really understand the appeal of souls games. We used

927
03:25:26,120 --> 03:25:30,040
to have NSNES games where you had to try multiple strategies to beat a boss that

928
03:25:30,040 --> 03:25:33,879
is still being able to be used today. I don't even know. I'm sorry. I missed it. It was going

929
03:25:33,879 --> 03:25:41,850
too fast. My eyes. Okay. I do not wake the dragon. I'm not doing that right now. I think I have to

930
03:25:41,850 --> 03:25:46,520
have a little bit more health and maybe some more magic resistance because I have a lot of it on

931
03:25:46,520 --> 03:26:06,409
right now. Wait. Oh no. This is the guy that has the key. I have, I have to kill this guy

932
03:26:06,409 --> 03:26:18,819
with the key because he's going to drop the key. Right. Unless it's behind him. He could be sleeping

933
03:26:18,819 --> 03:26:58,760
on it. Maybe, maybe he's sleeping on it or something. There it is. I'm trying to sneak and

934
03:26:58,760 --> 03:27:14,729
he can hear me. Flintstone Key Academy. Goodbye. That's terrifying. Okay. Goodbye. I just wanted

935
03:27:14,729 --> 03:27:28,790
to steal your treasure. Thief. Oh, magnificent smarag. Your presence precedes you. Oh, isn't

936
03:27:28,790 --> 03:27:38,219
that what a thief would say. Oh, terrifying and powerful smarag. The legends truly are

937
03:27:39,180 --> 03:27:49,190
correct when they describe you. I always want you to take it so I could see the look on his face

938
03:27:49,190 --> 03:27:55,510
when he sees them, when he goes into there, into the academy. He's way too underleveled.

939
03:27:56,739 --> 03:28:27,139
Oh, great and powerful smarag. Okay. He's gone. I got it. That's, that was fun. Excuse me. Well,

940
03:28:27,139 --> 03:28:30,340
okay. I'm going to investigate what's going on over here. Cause like, who are these people? And I'm

941
03:28:30,340 --> 03:28:43,209
very curious. Who are you and what are you protecting? I love when I hit somebody with

942
03:28:43,209 --> 03:28:50,280
this weapon. There's like a blue splash because it's magic damage. Hell yeah. What are they doing

943
03:28:50,280 --> 03:29:13,590
over here? I'm curious how much damage this actually does. Let's find out. But I don't think

944
03:29:13,590 --> 03:29:20,920
it's a, it justifies swinging it. It's a really bad ability. Yeah, it is. I could see that. That

945
03:29:20,920 --> 03:29:26,809
would might be kind of cool when there's a huge group of enemies and they're all piled up before

946
03:29:26,809 --> 03:29:38,020
we kill them all in one hit. But besides that kind of jump punish staggers. Ah, that's true.

947
03:29:40,120 --> 03:29:45,159
So, okay. If I stagger someone, right? Let's say I stagger a boss or a boss is like in the middle

948
03:29:45,159 --> 03:29:52,729
of changing to like phase two. Is that worth just charging that up? I wonder you got to find

949
03:29:52,729 --> 03:30:17,319
gob. All right. I'm going to go open the door. I don't know where that is. Open the door. I have

950
03:30:17,319 --> 03:30:46,950
a key. Let me in. That was a certified gob moment. I'm in here. Damn. All right. What was that?

951
03:30:53,770 --> 03:31:00,659
I love how much of a gamer you are when it comes to Souls games, but everything else,

952
03:31:00,659 --> 03:31:13,899
you're a clown man. Well, you have to understand. You can't, I can't, I can't like be clown guy

953
03:31:14,870 --> 03:31:20,489
in the middle of some of these boss fights. It doesn't work. I have to, I have to really try

954
03:31:20,489 --> 03:31:28,040
to play the game and really, I really have to, where am I going? Wait, is this back out?

955
03:31:31,209 --> 03:31:46,250
You saw what happened when I was funny clown guy. What the fuck? Okay. Turn around. I need to be,

956
03:31:46,250 --> 03:31:56,709
I got to go in the academy. Deliver the key to the apprentice now. The one that you bought spells.

957
03:31:56,709 --> 03:31:59,590
Yeah, I was thinking about, I think, is that going to get rid of the key though?

958
03:32:01,700 --> 03:32:05,700
If I give him the key, won't it expel it and I can't come back in here? Like I need to,

959
03:32:05,700 --> 03:32:38,819
I want to do this. I clear this first. I'm going to Academy of Rhea Lucaria.

960
03:33:15,829 --> 03:33:23,899
This is my hometown. This is my like home turf here. Blink your eyes a few times and let's go.

961
03:33:30,649 --> 03:33:35,370
I actually really liked Bergenwerth in Bloodborne and I was sad that it was not that large.

962
03:33:36,649 --> 03:33:43,700
Something about like a academy, like a magic academy, or like a, it is, I think it's really

963
03:33:43,700 --> 03:33:47,940
interesting. Bergenwerth was awesome and this is kind of like Bergenwerth. It's a big, this is

964
03:33:47,940 --> 03:33:55,219
big Bergenwerth because I'm going to love it. Oh, you want to play the casting game, huh?

965
03:33:56,549 --> 03:34:22,469
All right, fellow wizards. Never mind. Never mind. Slice. I don't think, yeah, they probably have a

966
03:34:22,469 --> 03:34:28,729
ton of magic resistance because they're wizards. I might not be as useful here as I think I am.

967
03:34:35,559 --> 03:34:41,579
They're all the burger king. You just ruined this whole area, dude.

968
03:34:43,190 --> 03:34:47,639
You ruined this whole game for me now. Come on.

969
03:35:03,079 --> 03:35:38,920
Holy shit, that sucked. Run. Let's get 50 subs. Brock League, get 50 subs. What are you doing?

970
03:35:38,920 --> 03:35:52,280
That's insane. Holy shit, dude. Thanks for the 50 subs. I love this area. I do. I love it. I'm

971
03:35:52,280 --> 03:36:02,889
gonna, it's gonna be, okay. Here we go. This might be my favorite area of the game. I'm gonna make a

972
03:36:02,889 --> 03:36:20,229
prediction. I'm gonna be sad if I'm wrong. I can upgrade the weapon again. We just got here 30

973
03:36:20,229 --> 03:36:31,540
seconds ago, dude. Yeah, but I mean, come on. You hear like chimes? Burger King wizards? Weird

974
03:36:31,540 --> 03:36:53,399
people that are like freaking out. I'm gonna do less mana potions here because I feel like,

975
03:36:56,700 --> 03:37:00,860
feel like I'm not gonna be casting that often because they're casters and I would probably

976
03:37:00,860 --> 03:37:20,569
rather just get up there and smash them. What's it saying? Burger King paintings? That's so dumb.

977
03:37:21,209 --> 03:37:34,809
That's so dumb. That's so dumb that it makes me laugh. Okay, outside. I'm gonna assume we're

978
03:37:34,809 --> 03:38:17,020
gonna go around. Smithing stone. Looks like a Dark Souls 3 area. Uh, what the? Wow, that's enormous.

979
03:38:17,579 --> 03:38:46,420
These guys have a lot of health. That's not gonna work, is it? What, what? Oy, oy, oy, oy, oy.

980
03:38:46,899 --> 03:38:54,459
How much damage does this do? Not very much at all. They're really slow though. Get off me. What?

981
03:38:55,420 --> 03:39:24,229
Oh, he just sucked all my mana. Not worth doing. Get off of me. Where was he even coming from?

982
03:39:29,420 --> 03:40:01,690
Oh my god, they're fucking everywhere. Get the fuck away from me. They're so fast and they want to

983
03:40:02,329 --> 03:40:09,260
I gotta line them up so I can hit them more. I can do cleave. That cleave is good.

984
03:40:09,500 --> 03:40:46,170
Okay, one more. He doesn't, he double taps. He can do it twice. Stop whining? Am I whining? I'm

985
03:40:46,170 --> 03:40:56,520
like, what are you talking about? These are disgusting creatures. Hey, they're using magic

986
03:40:56,520 --> 03:41:17,500
on magic eaters. Spell proof liver. The bridge now? This thing's going down, right? Like this

987
03:41:17,500 --> 03:41:33,180
thing's, of course it's going down. This bridge is going down. Shit, that dog. I'm gonna accidentally

988
03:41:33,180 --> 03:41:36,700
slice this and the bridge is gonna collapse. I'm just, I think that's what's gonna happen.

989
03:41:38,549 --> 03:41:53,420
Don't dodge on a bridge, you fool. Alright, I can't dodge here. Get off of me. Don't dodge. Get away.

990
03:41:54,219 --> 03:43:00,489
I hate this. Just do it. Do it. They're just so, they're so, they taunt you. They're just like,

991
03:43:00,489 --> 03:43:04,649
I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it in a second and I'm gonna do it a few times in a row. I gotta

992
03:43:04,649 --> 03:43:11,270
just go in now. It's just like, hey, hey, you know it's gonna happen. You know I'm gonna do it.

993
03:43:13,989 --> 03:43:27,510
I'm out of potions. Just seeing what would happen. What the fuck happened? What was that?

994
03:43:27,510 --> 03:43:38,549
Something just sprinted by my face. What was that? What was that? What was that? That was like a dust

995
03:43:38,549 --> 03:44:16,500
ball. It was the Blair Witch. I'm probably gonna die here. These guys, you have to just attack them

996
03:44:16,500 --> 03:44:21,299
over and over again. Do not let them even get one second of time. Not even a second.

997
03:44:22,100 --> 03:44:31,299
There's a guy right behind me. He's over there. He's over here. He's over there. He's over there.

998
03:44:40,579 --> 03:45:22,840
You just gotta, they're probably spawning behind me. What the, no. He was just ready.

999
03:45:23,559 --> 03:45:32,969
I didn't even see him. I'm running by these chumps. The shield, will the shield, wait,

1000
03:45:32,969 --> 03:45:42,489
will the shield block that or is it, technically it's a grab, right? It's kind of far away. Isn't

1001
03:45:42,489 --> 03:45:52,069
that technically, it's a grab. Would that, would that work? Let me try it. Oh, it's a grab.

1002
03:45:53,190 --> 03:45:57,559
I don't want to lose those souls though. I was supposed to just run off the cliff. I was running.

1003
03:46:00,889 --> 03:46:05,450
What about you boys? I can't summon them here for some reason. Do I not have enough mana?

1004
03:46:08,250 --> 03:46:23,719
No, I can't summon them here. They're not allowed here. Yeah, fuck it. Let's just go.

1005
03:46:24,680 --> 03:46:51,399
Magic Grease and, uh, trouble here. He's spawning as I'm stuck here.

1006
03:46:55,719 --> 03:47:09,989
I gotta get in that goddamn building. How can we suck at this? Why do you suck so hard?

1007
03:47:10,790 --> 03:47:18,420
Man, that's a troll comment. I mean, I know that this is the first time I've ever seen this.

1008
03:47:19,139 --> 03:47:55,479
This isn't like my ninth playthrough of Dark Souls 2. What are you talking about? Get in the building.

1009
03:47:55,479 --> 03:48:24,549
Nope. Oh my God. Oh, on fire. Oh my, come on, man. Not like this. Not like this. Some of you

1010
03:48:24,549 --> 03:48:39,750
fucking fall off and die. Okay. So I just got swarmed. Use your shield. Guys, I can't,

1011
03:48:39,750 --> 03:48:44,469
you can't block the grab attack. They just grab you. It's not a thing you can do. I can't block it.

1012
03:48:45,270 --> 03:48:52,760
And how, you want me to hold the shield up where there's five dogs on every single,

1013
03:48:53,799 --> 03:49:22,469
acute angle of my body? Ooh, okay. I don't like this. I, what the fuck? I can't get it. I can't

1014
03:49:22,469 --> 03:49:37,030
reach that. I can't reach that. Whatever that is. Holy fucking smokes, dude. All right. Back up,

1015
03:49:37,030 --> 03:49:45,159
back up, back up, back up. That just like threw me off so hard. You know what? Eat shit. You know

1016
03:49:45,159 --> 03:50:11,850
what? Eat shit again. I know. I said we started up shit a third time. Ooh, what's that? This is

1017
03:50:11,850 --> 03:50:24,489
intelligence. Pulls foes forward towards caster. Pull. That actually might be really useful. Okay,

1018
03:50:24,489 --> 03:50:28,250
we found like the one enemy where that was actually useful to do it on, but how do I get up here?

1019
03:50:28,969 --> 03:50:51,139
The infamous triple decker. It sucks them up. Might be fun to play with. It actually could be,

1020
03:50:51,139 --> 03:50:56,340
actually. You never want to just kind of close gaps in this game, but I wonder if it's a stun.

1021
03:50:57,139 --> 03:51:01,129
I wonder if you pull them and they have like a second or so. Maybe it's like a,

1022
03:51:02,329 --> 03:51:27,379
I wonder if it's a, if it's a stagger. That would be huge if it was. Where's this end? Holy shit.

1023
03:51:27,379 --> 03:51:34,309
I almost just died. I almost just went all the way. I'm so glad I was facing the right way.

1024
03:51:35,110 --> 03:52:00,629
Get up there. 312 damage. That's so good. Those guys are so susceptible to it.

1025
03:52:01,510 --> 03:52:26,260
I saw something over here. What was it? Wait. All right. Hold on. Not doing that yet. Is

1026
03:52:26,260 --> 03:52:36,760
this a secret chest? Shit. Well, let me, there might be a bonfire up here. Yeah, there is. Okay.

1027
03:52:36,760 --> 03:52:56,620
Thank God. Weirdo over there. All right. I cannot level up yet. Let's walk over here first.

1028
03:53:01,500 --> 03:53:19,899
What the hell was that? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Where's my parry? Oh, because I changed the

1029
03:53:19,899 --> 03:53:26,139
weapon art. It's not a parry anymore. It's like a holy thing. Right, right, right. Okay. Because

1030
03:53:26,139 --> 03:53:31,079
the parry is technically a weapon art. Right. Well, I kind of want to, I gotta fix that.

1031
03:53:42,889 --> 03:54:25,450
Where's parry? Parry the platypus? Oh, staggered. I'm going to put the pole on. Let's try. Did I

1032
03:54:25,450 --> 03:54:38,200
fight Godric? I did. What does it look like? It doesn't take too, too long. Let's see what it does.

1033
03:54:41,579 --> 03:54:56,420
It actually is really not bad. It is a stagger. It makes him kind of go like,

1034
03:55:12,629 --> 03:55:26,389
you're alive. It's not a bad move, especially in a one-on-one scenario. If it's a hard enemy,

1035
03:55:26,389 --> 03:55:38,059
you can just kind of stagger him for a second and get away. Oh my Lord. This is going to be fucking

1036
03:55:38,059 --> 03:56:11,989
hell. What the fuck? Hello. Oh, it's a pot guy. Everyone was looking for the pot. There he is.

1037
03:56:12,709 --> 03:56:25,690
All right. Well, I need to come here. It doesn't work on the pot, but magic. Oh my fucking Lord.

1038
03:56:25,690 --> 03:57:18,870
Run away. Magic. Didn't you say it was in the pot? Okay. They've, they've reset. Can I

1039
03:57:18,870 --> 03:57:23,659
get a backstab now? No. Cause he's right there. I got to, I just got to run it and start swinging

1040
03:57:25,299 --> 03:57:29,379
unless you could do magic versus magic. And I think that's the play here.

1041
03:57:30,579 --> 03:58:33,530
I got to get line of sight on that guy. Oh my God. This sucks. God damn it. Damn. Okay.

1042
03:58:34,489 --> 03:58:51,620
I got legendary chest. Ritual pot. What's that? Container required for crafting ritual pot items,

1043
03:58:52,180 --> 03:58:58,469
which I don't know. I got it again. I have to sit down and figure out what the hell crafting even

1044
03:58:58,469 --> 03:59:04,229
is. I've spent the entire game just not doing it at all and not paying any attention to it at all.

1045
03:59:05,590 --> 03:59:43,260
It's locked. Yeah. You think I'm dumb, but you think I'm dumb. It's a boss right here.

1046
03:59:43,260 --> 03:59:58,020
Okay. I was about to hit me with this book. Okay. Fuck. This is like a leader.

1047
04:00:01,590 --> 04:00:06,979
Nope. There's gotta be a bonfire right here, right? There always is. Is there not a bonfire?

1048
04:00:07,620 --> 04:00:21,110
Oh, you gotta be shitting me. It's not a bonfire. There has to be. I'm not done looking around.

1049
04:00:21,909 --> 04:01:15,159
Okay. Is there not actually a bonfire? It's actually really, really bad news. It's not

1050
04:01:15,159 --> 04:01:26,729
because this was a pain in the ass to get up here. It's going to have to run through every time.

1051
04:01:27,959 --> 04:01:41,190
Hmm. Really though, I don't, I don't buy it. I don't buy it. I don't buy it. I like actually

1052
04:01:41,190 --> 04:01:49,270
don't buy it because this is really far away. Yeah. This is like really far away. And this is

1053
04:01:49,270 --> 04:01:55,639
the way to get over here. Remember that spot where I could drop down on the other side of the

1054
04:01:55,639 --> 04:02:01,639
waterfall? I have a feeling that that opens the door back here. I remember the door. It was like,

1055
04:02:01,639 --> 04:02:07,450
Oh, this is shut. That one right there. I have to imagine that I could open that door

1056
04:02:08,090 --> 04:02:13,829
if I go on the other side of the waterfall, which is precisely what I'm going to do.

1057
04:02:15,559 --> 04:02:22,860
We want gob. I don't know what gob is. Yeah. I absolutely have to open that up from the inside.

1058
04:02:26,180 --> 04:02:38,200
Everything is dead here, so I'll be fine. Make sure I didn't miss it somehow.

1059
04:02:40,739 --> 04:03:11,670
Wait, this is not that bad. Is though. Ooh, more spells. Okay. I think I just have to run.

1060
04:03:11,670 --> 04:03:23,049
I think I just have to run. You missed the wall. What? What do you, does that have the wall?

1061
04:03:26,280 --> 04:03:30,010
Wait, so that means there must be more. We're checking every bookcase.

1062
04:03:32,870 --> 04:03:41,450
Illusory walls are confirmed to be in the game. It's been a while. It's actually been a long time.

1063
04:03:42,010 --> 04:04:44,340
Up the stairs right here. Oh, I went through it though. This one up the stairs. Maybe I just,

1064
04:04:44,340 --> 04:04:48,020
that's going to be such a huge pain in the ass to run through those guys because the amount of

1065
04:04:48,020 --> 04:05:02,309
times they cast. Come on. Let me be, let this be right. Really? Come on. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

1066
04:05:02,309 --> 04:05:31,110
Yes. There's no bonfire in here. That's good. What's in the chest? What's that? Comet requires

1067
04:05:31,110 --> 04:05:39,659
52 intelligence to use. Fires a great magical comet. It can be cast repeatedly and while in

1068
04:05:39,659 --> 04:05:46,440
motion, charging enhances the potency. 52 intelligence. Good luck. We're never getting

1069
04:05:46,440 --> 04:06:00,940
there. Oh, there's a ladder. Is it even mathematically possible for me to get to 52?

1070
04:06:02,379 --> 04:06:16,059
All the points I've been spending everywhere else. You don't just put this up for no reason. Why is

1071
04:06:16,059 --> 04:06:25,030
this? This has to be left. There's no way this is not a different reason. It's impossible that

1072
04:06:25,030 --> 04:07:03,350
there would be nothing here. Jump down. Other side. Wait, what the fuck am I? I don't, guys,

1073
04:07:03,350 --> 04:07:29,459
I don't know what's down here. What's down here? Am I dead? What is that? Oh my god. It's a

1074
04:07:29,459 --> 04:07:41,979
gigantic, this could be huge. I hear a person behind me. Stupid little jello containers. All

1075
04:07:41,979 --> 04:07:52,250
right. Don't die here. Don't die. Where am I? That's definitely a sorcery talisman. Absolutely.

1076
04:07:52,250 --> 04:08:42,469
That is a sorcery talisman without a single doubt. They give a lot of souls. Is there anything else

1077
04:08:42,469 --> 04:08:49,850
in here? No bonfire, though. But that, let's take a look. Is this, do we have one now?

1078
04:08:52,329 --> 04:09:08,139
Oh my god. Finally. Finally. Raises the potency of sorceries. I lost max equipment load, though.

1079
04:09:09,340 --> 04:09:11,340
It doesn't seem like it really matters that much in this game.

1080
04:09:12,620 --> 04:09:17,899
Because I'm not mid-rolling. I should be, shouldn't I? How forgiving is mid-rolling and

1081
04:09:17,899 --> 04:09:35,260
fat-rolling now? Because I am well over 50 percent. Fat-roll is 70 percent. You are

1082
04:09:35,260 --> 04:09:40,739
mid-rolling, but mid-rolling was buffed. What does it look like if you're not mid-rolling?

1083
04:09:41,459 --> 04:10:11,700
Interesting, okay. I want the highest magic defense. Four, five, five, eight, six, eight.

1084
04:10:13,059 --> 04:10:20,790
I really don't, I don't really even tell a difference. Maybe, is it, I think the,

1085
04:10:20,950 --> 04:10:34,870
the underneath, the regular naked roll? Maybe you go a little bit further? I don't know. Cool.

1086
04:10:34,870 --> 04:10:43,940
Nonetheless, it's the stamina difference. Oh, all right. Well, I wonder how much more potent

1087
04:10:43,940 --> 04:10:51,780
these sorceries are because I need to go back to the bonfire. It looks, I guess you just have to

1088
04:10:51,780 --> 04:10:56,180
run. I think you just have to run through, which is a huge pain in the ass, but it doesn't seem

1089
04:10:56,180 --> 04:11:22,680
to be that far. Just got to run. Are there more walls? Hit the crystal. Uh, we will in a minute.

1090
04:11:24,459 --> 04:11:34,889
I'm putting a point into intelligence. All right. Well, I got to kill some people anyways.

1091
04:11:35,850 --> 04:11:38,649
Let's see how much more damage my, well, it's hard to tell on these guys, but

1092
04:11:39,610 --> 04:12:02,629
I need like 10,000. Oh, hell yeah. That's a good drop. Mm-hmm. Magic defense.

1093
04:12:06,520 --> 04:12:11,979
There's not a chance in hell that I don't need it here.

1094
04:12:22,870 --> 04:12:38,329
I need like 10,000. Yeah, this room in particular, I use, how am I supposed to run through this room?

1095
04:12:39,129 --> 04:13:24,090
I just sprint by. I forgot about the pot. The pot's still here. I've got huge arms. I forgot.

1096
04:13:34,629 --> 04:13:43,139
All right. Almost to 10,000. I think one more guy and that should do it.

1097
04:13:44,100 --> 04:13:53,559
Somebody said hit the crystal. Let's see what happens if I hit the crystal.

1098
04:13:54,120 --> 04:14:23,590
Nothing happened. Time to level up intelligence. You know that's what we're doing. Then boss time.

1099
04:14:23,590 --> 04:14:30,979
I'm going to give it a try. No, not boss time. Uh, we're going to level up and I'm going to go.

1100
04:14:31,860 --> 04:14:34,260
How much is it to level up? Cause I want to make sure I have enough to upgrade the weapon.

1101
04:14:34,979 --> 04:14:48,760
9,500. Let me see how much it takes to do this. So I'm here. All right. Schoolhouse.

1102
04:14:56,020 --> 04:15:13,190
Uh, cause I have enough stones to do the weapon again. I believe. When is German going to notice

1103
04:15:13,190 --> 04:15:26,979
he has a health debuff? I do. What do you mean? Oh, it's somber smithing stone five.

1104
04:15:28,520 --> 04:15:44,120
Not what I have. Well, nevermind. Health debuff from getting hugged have to use the

1105
04:15:44,120 --> 04:16:22,739
blessing to cure it. What do you mean? This? My health is the same. Go get hugged. Wait, did it work?

1106
04:16:23,620 --> 04:16:38,149
I am pleased. Would you like me? Um, yeah. Okay. Come closer. It was because she hugged me.

1107
04:16:44,139 --> 04:16:59,190
You are so fucking secret. I was known as a deathbed companion after I received the warmth

1108
04:16:59,190 --> 04:17:07,100
and life figure from a number of champions. I lay with the remains of an exalted noble

1109
04:17:07,899 --> 04:17:15,620
to grant him another chance at life. To do so is the purpose of my being.

1110
04:17:18,020 --> 04:17:20,739
Maybe that was the difference from getting instantly killed by the dragon.

1111
04:17:20,739 --> 04:17:29,879
I was awakened by the guidance of grace and chased from my birthplace. Pray, be kind.

1112
04:17:29,879 --> 04:17:39,639
Despite all that, I still wish to be a deathbed companion. So please, let me hold you like this

1113
04:17:40,680 --> 04:17:52,899
as often as it takes and good day to you. Okay. So I'm, I currently have like a little blessing

1114
04:17:52,899 --> 04:17:58,100
curse thingy. Having the blessing in your inventory gives you a 5% debuff. It will wear off once you

1115
04:17:58,100 --> 04:18:28,680
use the blessing. That is weird. Okay. I don't, wait for it to, that's weird. That's weird.

1116
04:18:33,670 --> 04:18:36,950
All right. We're going to, we're going to do intelligence. Then we're going to do, uh,

1117
04:18:36,950 --> 04:18:50,889
vigor and then mind. And I need to get dexterity up to like 25 as well. Okay. I have, for now,

1118
04:18:50,889 --> 04:18:54,809
I'm going to keep my flasks the way they are because in case I need to do any sorceries.

1119
04:18:55,930 --> 04:19:11,270
But, um, let's go. Let's see what happens here. Uh, let me see if I can just run by.

1120
04:19:20,540 --> 04:19:42,389
Hmm. Goodbye. Goodbye. It's not that bad of a run. All right. Let's go. Red wolf of Rattagon.

1121
04:19:43,989 --> 04:20:06,280
Double headphones for this. Oh, he's so susceptible to this weapon.

1122
04:21:02,469 --> 04:21:09,059
Shit. I almost had a first try. Damn it. Okay. All right. All right. All right. I almost had a

1123
04:21:09,059 --> 04:21:23,209
first try. Damn it. Oh well. Uh, this weapon is really good against this guy. I probably would

1124
04:21:23,209 --> 04:21:27,610
have had it. The only problem was when he went to the back and started like putting the like,

1125
04:21:29,290 --> 04:21:42,260
I was kind of like, what does that do? I didn't know what was happening. I actually should probably

1126
04:21:42,260 --> 04:21:46,540
just do health. There's no, I mean, how am I going to cast the spell at this guy? There's no way.

1127
04:21:48,409 --> 04:22:05,879
All right, let's go reposition. Okay. I got to get the timing on that.

1128
04:22:21,479 --> 04:22:25,000
Shit. I didn't mean to press. I'm all right. I mean, like getting the fucking handle.

1129
04:22:26,360 --> 04:22:30,200
Like, you know, when you just like kind of stay there and like your hands are still on B and

1130
04:22:30,200 --> 04:22:41,270
you're just like, get, get off, get off of, get the fuck off of B. Don't get greedy. No, I'll be

1131
04:22:41,270 --> 04:22:51,430
good. Some of the little squirt guys. I don't think I need summons for this one. Again, I forgot to

1132
04:22:51,430 --> 04:22:59,180
fucking put the flasks on. And I also probably shouldn't be wearing, maybe I should cause the

1133
04:22:59,180 --> 04:23:07,850
magic damage. Oh, this guy's not too bad. Unless there's like a phase two after this, which they

1134
04:23:07,850 --> 04:23:23,959
very well might be. Let's just see what happens. All right. Focus. Okay. Delay on those things.

1135
04:23:24,520 --> 04:23:31,770
A lot longer. And I think it takes about three full seconds, puts them down and they sit there

1136
04:23:31,770 --> 04:23:54,620
like one, two, three. Then they go, but the, what does the Fox say on a 10 hour loop while you fight

1137
04:23:54,620 --> 04:24:09,079
this? Okay. I kind of gotten unlucky. He's done that like twice in a row now. All right. I got

1138
04:24:09,079 --> 04:24:37,319
to get in close. Holy shit. I kind of hope I too bad. I didn't beat him first drive. This guy's

1139
04:24:37,319 --> 04:24:51,059
actually kind of difficult. Almost had it. Why is the first try always the best? Cause the first

1140
04:24:51,059 --> 04:24:55,620
try is always the best because you always go in there and you just like, I don't give a shit. I

1141
04:24:55,620 --> 04:25:01,540
have no idea what the fuck is happening. And you just let your body just do it and not your brain.

1142
04:25:02,340 --> 04:25:08,020
Problem is now after being in there a couple of times, my brain has figured out what he's doing

1143
04:25:08,020 --> 04:25:13,059
and my brain is going, Jeremy, he's got that move, you know, and he's going to use it on you. You

1144
04:25:13,059 --> 04:25:18,899
got to be careful. He's got, he's got those moves, you know, you know what they do. I got it. I'm

1145
04:25:18,899 --> 04:25:55,579
all right. I'm turning my brain off. Christ. Especially when he dashes across the room and

1146
04:25:55,579 --> 04:26:03,620
the camera changes. So I can't see them. There's a battle mage set right outside the door.

1147
04:26:04,860 --> 04:26:30,899
Huh? Don't tell him that. I thought I've explored every area. Please for the love of God.

1148
04:26:33,159 --> 04:26:45,719
Relax. I'm fine. There's no way. What do you mean? There's a battle mage set right outside the door.

1149
04:26:46,440 --> 04:26:53,500
I don't need it. I don't need it. I can get it. I just got, you got, I got to die like

1150
04:26:53,500 --> 04:27:31,110
30,000 more times in my pants. Oh my God. He's fast. Okay. I keep. So when, when he, when he,

1151
04:27:31,110 --> 04:27:36,920
okay, he has like two distinct sets here. He has one where he just with his mouth,

1152
04:27:37,639 --> 04:27:42,600
but then sometimes he'll go sword. And it's, it's hard to, I'm trying to figure out when,

1153
04:27:44,010 --> 04:27:47,930
uh, like when he puts his mouth up, he's going to put the sword in his hand and you gotta wait.

1154
04:27:48,889 --> 04:28:02,729
He's got a really, really fast, uh, just like little rare. This weapon is I got,

1155
04:28:02,729 --> 04:28:06,250
I got to keep this weapon on though. It's definitely the best thing that I have against him.

1156
04:28:32,950 --> 04:29:54,379
Damn it, man. Fuck you. Fuck you. I just panicked. Oh fuck. I panicked so hard on that

1157
04:29:54,379 --> 04:30:01,239
last one. I was so scared. The dog, I just held down the dodge button when he did the,

1158
04:30:01,239 --> 04:30:04,440
he casted the fucking blue shit. I was like, fuck man, he's going to come in.

1159
04:30:05,000 --> 04:30:13,209
And I thought there was one more that didn't shoot yet. Sorry. Damn. I'm sorry. I thought

1160
04:30:13,209 --> 04:30:16,809
there was one more that didn't shoot. That's why I was like, when is it going to fucking fire?

1161
04:30:17,610 --> 04:30:22,180
I got too cocky. No, you gotta be cocky. That's how you beat this shit.

1162
04:30:26,420 --> 04:30:33,219
Nobody ever beat a dark souls from software game boss going, I, I'm not so sure. I don't

1163
04:30:33,219 --> 04:30:42,299
know somebody else. No, you gotta, you gotta get in there and I'm, I don't even need it. Let's go.

1164
04:30:42,860 --> 04:31:05,690
You see what I mean? Like what, how come those didn't fire? That's what happened last time.

1165
04:31:06,329 --> 04:32:08,250
Are they stuck in the wall? That move sucks. That move sucks. There's almost no delay on that move.

1166
04:32:08,809 --> 04:32:21,370
I got to dodge the right. Oh man. Damn. Okay. So when he goes like this, when he goes like,

1167
04:32:22,010 --> 04:32:29,670
move is so hard to fucking predict. I got to start dodging to the right because it's, it's so quick.

1168
04:32:29,670 --> 04:32:37,739
It's just like a wham. There's not much any, there's no time. I almost had him too. It's just like,

1169
04:32:37,739 --> 04:32:42,569
sometimes those things don't fire. I think they get like stuck behind a bookcase or something.

1170
04:32:43,719 --> 04:32:47,559
But when you hear him be like, here it comes, it's almost like, why have they not fired yet?

1171
04:32:48,200 --> 04:32:57,719
It's kind of, it fucks you up. Sometimes he'll stagger them out. Oh, this guy, you motherfucker.

1172
04:32:58,360 --> 04:33:14,229
I'll get it. Bad start. I thought he was going to do the other move.

1173
04:33:32,009 --> 04:33:37,369
God damn it. Oh, cause like this, there's such a small amount of time.

1174
04:33:38,169 --> 04:33:44,650
Cause those things are staggered. But if you dodge, you, you're probably going to get hit by the

1175
04:33:45,369 --> 04:33:59,029
magic. Fuck. He kind of attacks in like a half second or like a two tenths of a second, either

1176
04:33:59,029 --> 04:34:06,200
faster or slower than those things come out. So I wonder if you just run. I think you just run.

1177
04:34:06,200 --> 04:34:09,959
I don't think you dodge. I just think you actually just run to like the left or the right.

1178
04:34:09,959 --> 04:34:26,740
Just run away. I don't think you dodge those. I think you just run. Try it. That's not going to

1179
04:34:26,740 --> 04:34:42,580
happen. That's not going to happen. Okay. So it might work sometimes, but that was one of the

1180
04:34:42,580 --> 04:34:46,740
times when he was like, Hey, I know you're across the whole, uh, the whole level here, but I'd like

1181
04:34:46,740 --> 04:34:53,220
to just in, uh, and then a 10th of a second be in your face and bite, bite your throat. That's great.

1182
04:34:53,860 --> 04:35:07,590
Am I getting worse? I am, I am testing out theories, testing out theories. Were you not

1183
04:35:07,590 --> 04:35:11,590
in the room when I just said, I want to try running and that guy for fucking five minutes.

1184
04:35:11,590 --> 04:36:30,700
Oh, you motherfucker. Stop with this. Greedy motherfucker.

1185
04:36:57,110 --> 04:37:17,029
How do I fucking God, that stupid thing. Did you see right before he came in,

1186
04:37:17,029 --> 04:37:33,819
right before I screamed, right before I screamed, he was the greedy one, not me.

1187
04:37:37,880 --> 04:37:41,400
And you know what else I just, I just unbind it. I don't care. I'm not stealthing ever again.

1188
04:37:42,040 --> 04:38:17,400
Like, what the fuck is the point? It doesn't, it doesn't do anything anyways. Let's go on a chance

1189
04:38:17,400 --> 04:38:29,380
in hell, man. Not a chance. No, give me the fuck away from that. We haven't seen that move in five,

1190
04:38:29,380 --> 04:38:57,909
10 attempts. Stupid fucking crouch. You literally killed him the first try. Okay. If I bind crouch

1191
04:38:57,909 --> 04:39:03,930
again, I just leave it unbound the whole game. Like I, there's actually literally not a single

1192
04:39:03,930 --> 04:39:09,290
reason to have it bound. Not one solitary reason to use it in the whole game. I'm never binding

1193
04:39:09,290 --> 04:39:34,470
it again. He would have been dead. Crouch, crouch, crouch. He was dead too. And like,

1194
04:39:34,470 --> 04:39:46,220
I just couldn't fucking move. Just wait, just wait till you get this fucking game or your goddamn

1195
04:39:46,220 --> 04:39:50,220
PlayStation three, whatever the hell it is. Oh, what's it called? What if a console exists?

1196
04:39:50,220 --> 04:39:55,020
Just wait till you crouch accidentally and you get killed. And then I want, I want to see your

1197
04:39:55,020 --> 04:39:58,860
fucking 10 page essay about how much you can't believe it's in the game.

1198
04:41:34,169 --> 04:41:44,900
What the fuck are you talking about? What did he hit? What did he hit me with? The very end of that

1199
04:41:44,900 --> 04:41:53,669
at the very fucking end, right in the tiny little backswing. When he said, Jeremy, you're using an

1200
04:41:53,669 --> 04:42:00,729
Xbox controller. It's not, it's not the game's fault. So you're telling me that like 7 million

1201
04:42:00,729 --> 04:42:08,139
people that have to play this on Xbox should just buy a new console. Now I could have chosen,

1202
04:42:08,139 --> 04:42:15,830
but I like the Xbox controller. I like the Xbox controller cause it's big for my big ass hands.

1203
04:42:17,240 --> 04:42:21,720
I can't use the PlayStation 4 controller cause I can not, my thumbs knock into each other.

1204
04:42:23,610 --> 04:44:03,610
Quiet. He does a third time. Yeah. Unbind that shit and never bind it ever again.

1205
04:44:17,130 --> 04:44:31,930
Sweating. All right. That's fun. Yeah. I don't, I just really shouldn't even bind it.

1206
04:44:32,729 --> 04:44:46,279
Hmm. I have an idea. Here we go. You ready? Here's my idea. My idea. This is my, might not be,

1207
04:44:50,419 --> 04:45:04,040
you can't call the map in combat, right? What if I made select crouch and left stick the map?

1208
04:45:06,259 --> 04:45:13,560
I wonder if that's a good idea. No, that would fuck with me in the regular game. Switch the

1209
04:45:13,560 --> 04:45:18,599
map and crouch. I mean, I'll try it. Maybe let's see. I might just be running away from like enemies

1210
04:45:18,599 --> 04:45:31,990
and like I'll open the map. Select is the alt menu. Yeah. What about like, I wish I could do like

1211
04:45:33,369 --> 04:45:40,459
combo or something. I just wish it was hold. It's the easiest way to fix that problem.

1212
04:45:40,459 --> 04:45:45,180
It's just pressing stick, hold for one second. You crouch. Nobody is crouching during any fights.

1213
04:45:45,180 --> 04:45:57,029
It's like something you do to sneak around. All right. I want to do health and we'll go from there.

1214
04:45:57,029 --> 04:46:06,389
We need more buttons. Well, that's like the red, the red dead way to do it, right? Is to like pick

1215
04:46:06,389 --> 04:46:12,759
up items or there were things tied to the same button, right? And, but you had to hold it.

1216
04:46:13,400 --> 04:46:19,990
And I complained about that too. You're the only one with this problem. I'm not. I've seen at least

1217
04:46:19,990 --> 04:46:26,380
three or four other streamers talk about this exact issue and other players. I've been scouring the

1218
04:46:26,380 --> 04:46:44,709
forums. I've been scouring the forums. Okay. So what do I want to do this again? That is a

1219
04:46:44,709 --> 04:46:52,009
brilliant idea, but I don't know if I don't think I can do it. That's absolutely brilliant. I don't

1220
04:46:52,009 --> 04:47:02,200
think it's going to work. Nope. I can't do keyboard. That's annoying. I cannot do a combo.

1221
04:47:04,819 --> 04:47:11,619
I mean, what, hold on. What is it? It's X and I just press. Hey, it's fucking game. I've got

1222
04:47:11,619 --> 04:47:32,659
damn it. Give me a break. You gotta be kidding me. Problem is officially officially fixed.

1223
04:47:43,580 --> 04:47:49,369
I do want to go back because I want to check out that wheel. This is going into the cringe

1224
04:47:49,369 --> 04:48:01,849
collection. I want to go to the wheel. Where's the wheel of the church? Where is it? Like right

1225
04:48:01,849 --> 04:48:11,020
here? Like right here. Right. How did that fix it? Cause I'm pressing X on the keyboard

1226
04:48:11,900 --> 04:48:19,139
and it's unbound. All right. Attention. All players that have the problem of accidentally

1227
04:48:19,139 --> 04:48:26,119
crouching all the time, a very simple solution X on your keyboard. If you're playing on PC is

1228
04:48:26,119 --> 04:48:33,400
bound to crouch. You can safely unbind left stick crouch and just hit X when you want to

1229
04:48:33,400 --> 04:48:46,630
crouch around. Let this be a public service announcement to you all. All right. Where's the

1230
04:48:46,630 --> 04:49:02,409
wheel? It's outside here. If you weren't dodging around like you're moving away from a moving car,

1231
04:49:02,409 --> 04:49:08,009
you'd be fine. This is one of the most intense video games that's available for you to play.

1232
04:49:10,950 --> 04:49:14,470
Of course people are going to get intense and grip their controllers harder and move around

1233
04:49:14,470 --> 04:49:27,560
faster. Well, I'm not playing Mario paint. Like I said last night. All right. Where's the wheel?

1234
04:49:28,119 --> 04:49:48,970
Oh, this is wrong. I just killed this idiot. Okay. Where I should have marked it. Graveyard.

1235
04:49:48,970 --> 04:50:04,520
Yeah. That was up in there, right? Look, just because I have an intensified gamer grip does

1236
04:50:04,520 --> 04:50:08,360
not mean that I should have to suffer because it's bound to the same button that is walk.

1237
04:50:10,380 --> 04:50:25,610
Where is it here? I should have marked it. I don't remember which one it is.

1238
04:50:25,610 --> 04:50:42,950
It's one of these a parlor right here on gate. I like this intense. No, it's not that one.

1239
04:50:42,950 --> 04:50:49,049
Is it actually the classroom? Just walk out of the classroom. I don't remember.

1240
04:50:51,860 --> 04:50:58,200
What do I do about this very important crouch issue? If I'm playing on a PS4,

1241
04:50:58,919 --> 04:51:18,090
I can't help you there. I'm, what am I doing? This dude's got a gorilla grip. I'm just saying

1242
04:51:18,810 --> 04:51:25,099
like that going from, okay, listen to me. I'm going to, it's time for the guy to spam the

1243
04:51:25,099 --> 04:51:31,459
email. Let's see the email. Spam the email. There is such a huge difference when you're playing a

1244
04:51:31,459 --> 04:51:36,500
game like this, but when you are, when you are moving at a speed that, you know, how many

1245
04:51:36,500 --> 04:51:43,939
nauticals per second, whatever it is, when it changes to this, that slight change is enough for

1246
04:51:43,939 --> 04:52:02,099
you. It's such a drastic change because your muscle memory is wrong. Okay. So where is it?

1247
04:52:02,740 --> 04:52:09,540
Down here or is it over here? It was a way I could drop down. It wasn't over there.

1248
04:52:23,540 --> 04:52:28,979
I'm so glad that that is a complete solution though. That is an absolute 100% solution on PC.

1249
04:52:28,979 --> 04:52:49,619
Perfect. Where was that other? I swear it was like I could drop down. What was it here? Remember I

1250
04:52:49,619 --> 04:52:57,049
was looking at it and I was going, Oh, I can go down there. Or do I just have to ride the

1251
04:52:57,610 --> 04:53:10,229
thing down? I swear. Where was it? Don't tell them. Not only there were platforms on the wheel.

1252
04:53:11,029 --> 04:53:14,729
I know I, yeah, but I mean, like I'm, I thought there was another way to do this.

1253
04:53:15,689 --> 04:53:31,509
I thought there was another, um, thing to drop down. When do I get off?

1254
04:53:32,229 --> 04:53:43,290
When am I supposed to get off? Oh shit. I was supposed to get off right there. Oh no. Can I

1255
04:53:43,290 --> 04:54:08,060
jump on anything? Where's it taking me? Oh, I'm alive. That hurt. Wow.

1256
04:54:17,299 --> 04:54:24,500
There's so many of these little fireflies down here that you got dodged through.

1257
04:54:25,380 --> 04:55:28,360
What is that? What are you doing? It's not that bad. There's a shitload of help.

1258
04:55:29,080 --> 04:55:43,240
All right. Drop anything? No, but I can freely. Oh, wow. This is cool. Okay. Look at all these

1259
04:55:43,240 --> 04:56:04,090
fireflies. Firefly city down here. Is he ever going to use magic? I am. His weapon scales with

1260
04:56:04,090 --> 04:56:35,319
magic. Long tail cat talisman. You're immune to fall damage. That's fucking huge. How much health

1261
04:56:35,319 --> 04:56:44,619
does that give though? Raises max HP. Okay. So this is at the point. I'm going to put it right

1262
04:56:44,619 --> 04:56:49,500
at the tip to the crystal right there. Right at the tip, the tip of that crystal. How much do I

1263
04:56:49,500 --> 04:56:59,639
lose? Hmm. I mean, that's kind of significant. It's not that big of a deal, but all right. No

1264
04:56:59,639 --> 04:57:22,500
more fall jokes. Sad. It's like 7%. It actually is a lot. Okay. So that's what's down here.

1265
04:57:22,500 --> 04:57:39,979
Anything else down here? These are so red. Greedy motherfucker. Greedy motherfucker.

1266
04:57:40,860 --> 04:57:53,000
Let's stick. Let's stick. Let's stick. Let's stick. Maybe that's why I'm so red. I don't think. Wait,

1267
04:57:53,000 --> 04:58:30,919
what's this? Wait, should I, can I test it? Huh? Uh, I think, I believe I just fell off of a clip.

1268
04:58:39,270 --> 04:58:48,659
Excuse me? Stop. That's not funny. Do you see the weapon? The item that I have equipped right now

1269
04:58:49,700 --> 04:58:55,700
renders the wearer immune to fall damage and I jump off to test to see if it works and I'm not

1270
04:58:55,700 --> 04:59:47,509
immune to fall damage. Excuse me. That's, that's a scam. Where are my souls? Maybe if it's too far,

1271
04:59:47,509 --> 04:59:56,619
it doesn't matter. I don't, that's not even worth putting on then. It's down further. Yeah,

1272
04:59:56,619 --> 05:00:02,729
I just think I'm assuming. Um, that's not worth putting on because all the times that you care

1273
05:00:02,729 --> 05:00:09,959
about falling in these games is to, is if you die by falling in these games. Nobody cares about

1274
05:00:09,959 --> 05:00:24,709
falling a little bit and like, Ooh, I took like 30% damage. Where's this magical set that you guys

1275
05:00:24,709 --> 05:00:38,360
told me was down here? Right there. How do I get up there? Oh, the mechanical thing is back.

1276
05:00:39,000 --> 05:00:50,419
Where are my souls? Where are they? Are they up on the, they're up on the goddamn cliff?

1277
05:00:51,139 --> 05:01:04,919
How do I get the fuck out of here? All right. There's a place I can run up. Where is it? Right

1278
05:01:04,919 --> 05:01:33,240
there. That is, that thing is hard. Fine. All right. So, so how do I get over there? I don't

1279
05:01:33,240 --> 05:01:44,009
understand. How do I get over there? Um, but where do I go from here? Where do I go from here?

1280
05:01:47,139 --> 05:01:57,849
Fucking God. Okay. Um, how do I get over there? Like that house is, it's like a weird house in

1281
05:01:57,849 --> 05:02:12,090
the distance. Where was that? I gotta see. Okay. Is there another ledge I can jump to?

1282
05:02:12,889 --> 05:03:00,299
Is it up there? I'm going to sell this to a fucking vendor. I wasn't even that far.

1283
05:03:00,700 --> 05:03:25,159
Okay. So I got to go up all the way. What is up there? Oh dude, check this out. What's this?

1284
05:03:25,880 --> 05:04:13,060
Rune? Hell yeah. I could have just walked up there. Okay. So this is the first wheel. I got to go all

1285
05:04:13,060 --> 05:04:21,319
the way up on the second wheel. Do I have that? Am I understanding that correctly? I'm going to

1286
05:04:21,319 --> 05:04:45,349
get my souls, which are on a ledge over here. Or they're right there, right? Where do I, where,

1287
05:04:45,349 --> 05:04:57,099
where do I go? Is this the right way? That just makes me back up that way. I go all the way up

1288
05:04:57,099 --> 05:05:19,290
that way. I'm going to get all the way up. All right. All right. And then this will go all the

1289
05:05:19,290 --> 05:05:38,869
way up to the top of this. Yeah. Yeah. Gets me here, which no, I'm no, this is back up where this guy

1290
05:05:38,869 --> 05:06:16,650
was. Did he even hire? I think it's even higher. Huh? Wait, I'm back at the top. Where is this

1291
05:06:16,650 --> 05:06:21,349
thing? I've been all the way to the bottom. I've been all the way to the top. You guys said this

1292
05:06:21,349 --> 05:06:29,450
like a super awesome magical item on the wheel. Where am I going? In this foggy ass place.

1293
05:06:30,250 --> 05:06:38,580
Oh, down the wheel. There's a ledge. Yeah. But there's, wait, the ledges I just jumped off onto.

1294
05:06:39,619 --> 05:06:52,459
Isn't that take me back around? Ledge is a ledge. This, you mean this ledge here. You're talking

1295
05:06:52,459 --> 05:06:57,400
about right here. You're talking about right there. You're talking, you're talking about right there.

1296
05:06:57,560 --> 05:07:02,869
I'm a writer and then I've run this way. I, that was so fucking holy shit. Okay. I'm fine.

1297
05:07:02,869 --> 05:07:06,439
And then you talk about this way, but I feel like, isn't this the same place where I just was?

1298
05:07:07,240 --> 05:07:14,500
Oh, God damn it. Okay. I honestly, I've been hit like three times. I didn't realize whatever

1299
05:07:23,500 --> 05:08:01,180
shit you do to those. You're out of your league. No, just can't just kill, just kill, kill, kill,

1300
05:08:01,180 --> 05:08:25,580
kill. What are you doing over here? Are you a Disney channel bully? I dare you. You're out of

1301
05:08:25,580 --> 05:08:46,310
your league or like a Sonic character. Ooh, it's those guys. Okay. That's where that is. So now

1302
05:08:46,310 --> 05:08:56,819
this is not what you were talking about though. There's more. I'm going to jump off the ledge.

1303
05:08:56,819 --> 05:09:32,330
You mean what? You mean there's more down there? I don't think I can make it today. I wonder,

1304
05:09:32,330 --> 05:09:37,689
can I jump from here to there? Maybe not. Maybe it might be possible. I don't think so.

1305
05:09:38,650 --> 05:09:48,220
I forgot about the jump. Jump invisible platform ahead. I'm going to paint crystals to the house

1306
05:09:48,220 --> 05:09:51,099
if we go down there. That's what I mean. Like, I wonder if I can jump from here.

1307
05:09:51,900 --> 05:09:57,720
Is it like something I can jump onto from here? Like with a running jump?

1308
05:09:58,680 --> 05:10:35,159
Try it. That's gotta be another way to get up there. Here we go. Oh hell yeah. Lost ashes of war.

1309
05:10:41,529 --> 05:10:57,669
Nice. What does those do? He used to duplicate an ash of war so I can put it in two different items.

1310
05:11:01,930 --> 05:11:05,849
That's still not what you guys are talking about. All right, let me take a look here.

1311
05:11:06,569 --> 05:11:12,759
You're talking about that ledge right there? It's the only other ledge that I've seen.

1312
05:11:13,560 --> 05:11:21,369
Is that the one? So I gotta get... It's when you're going down. It's that crystal right there.

1313
05:11:22,090 --> 05:11:39,259
I've never played this. I cannot call the whole thing. All the way over here. Congratulations.

1314
05:11:39,819 --> 05:12:04,389
A little bit higher, but I just... I could get on this. I was seeing what was here.

1315
05:12:04,389 --> 05:12:13,450
I was seeing what was here. Relax. I was seeing what was there. There's another one right next to it.

1316
05:12:29,000 --> 05:12:47,590
Dude, what the fuck? Really? What? It's higher than this? I'm getting fucked with this. No,

1317
05:12:47,590 --> 05:12:52,310
there's nothing else here. Where is this magical ledge? You guys, I've been fucking with for like

1318
05:12:52,310 --> 05:13:00,250
30 minutes. I think you guys, have you guys actually just been messing with me? Don't even

1319
05:13:00,250 --> 05:13:12,599
tell me you've actually just been messing with me. You might have been. No way. It's higher?

1320
05:13:13,240 --> 05:13:38,419
Is it on the same side? No, that's not it. That's where... That's what the... I just was

1321
05:13:38,419 --> 05:13:42,340
fighting people there. The school room. Go inside the left room where there's a balcony.

1322
05:13:42,340 --> 05:14:17,849
Jump to the far left side of the balcony. Okay, I don't know... Stop telling me to get on the

1323
05:14:17,849 --> 05:15:23,299
elevator. What the fuck? I have to jump on the ledge off the elevator? It was by the elevator.

1324
05:15:24,470 --> 05:16:18,819
Come on. Oh, I'm gonna look so cool. Let's fucking go. Now I look really cool. I look so... I look

1325
05:16:18,819 --> 05:16:24,950
sick. Look at how cool this looks. All right, for all the haters, I'll take the helmet off.

1326
05:16:24,950 --> 05:16:43,750
Not even a thank you. Thank you for... Now it actually is Captain Hook. Thank you for telling me

1327
05:16:43,750 --> 05:16:48,549
where that was. Although, if you remember, I would like you to rewind when I looked over here and I

1328
05:16:48,549 --> 05:16:53,189
said, there's a ledge down there. I could probably jump onto that. And then a million screaming

1329
05:16:53,189 --> 05:16:58,790
haters were saying, get on the elevator. Dude, up the elevator. Look over at the elevator. Get on

1330
05:16:58,790 --> 05:17:17,669
the elevator. A million screaming haters. How do I get out of here? Is there anything else I can do

1331
05:17:17,669 --> 05:17:26,970
here? What about down there? Oh, look at that. Facts. I think down there is something cool down there.

1332
05:17:27,610 --> 05:17:51,270
Facts. Now let's teleport out. So, uh, uh, so I killed the boss here. Like, what did I get?

1333
05:17:54,950 --> 05:18:08,419
Oh my god, what the fuck just happened? Jesus. My microphone stand just like broke.

1334
05:18:09,220 --> 05:18:35,819
Hold on, I'll mute this. That was weird. I just, yeah, my like thing just popped off.

1335
05:18:38,200 --> 05:18:47,049
Still another boss here. Yeah, let me, I gotta keep going this way. I like it with the helmet on.

1336
05:18:47,049 --> 05:18:54,099
All right. Uh, cool. Did everything I needed to do. We're best here. Go through the door. Cool,

1337
05:18:54,099 --> 05:19:06,540
cool, cool, cool, cool. Although do I have any crunchies? Cause I probably need. I don't,

1338
05:19:06,540 --> 05:19:24,090
so I have to be careful. Is there another boss like right now? I need the souls. I have to go

1339
05:19:24,090 --> 05:19:58,229
kill these crabs. Give me 10,000. 10,000. I'll be happy. I need people here to get souls.

1340
05:19:59,189 --> 05:20:07,750
They hit me in the tail and hit me with that. Another one of these mechanical people.

1341
05:20:08,790 --> 05:20:30,419
Are you susceptible to magic? Probably not, right? Get away from me. Oh, you got me. Oh no.

1342
05:20:31,139 --> 05:21:15,979
Whatever. I'm not going to get mad. That was, that was terrifying. I got two of these now,

1343
05:21:18,409 --> 05:21:29,020
which wasn't there. Okay. After castle skip, foggy door needs a key. Remember that?

1344
05:21:29,580 --> 05:21:32,619
I can remember where that was, but there was a little, uh, dungeon I could go in.

1345
05:21:33,259 --> 05:21:59,020
Oh, you just, he's killing it. Just kill everything. That's fine.

1346
05:22:04,299 --> 05:22:23,430
Shit dude. What in the name of God are you doing? I get a little up. I think I should have enough.

1347
05:22:34,759 --> 05:22:37,720
200 more. And what am I going to put it into? Mind probably.

1348
05:22:40,060 --> 05:22:57,500
No, dexterity. I've not put a point in dexterity in a long time. Hey, one more for good luck.

1349
05:23:12,840 --> 05:23:16,439
Haley message. See if you, if you've gone insane. Uh, I think I'm doing okay.

1350
05:23:16,439 --> 05:23:35,700
What's the damage on this thing now? 39 plus 28 139 plus 26. Okay. Continue. Now I'm not

1351
05:23:35,700 --> 05:23:43,639
terrified of dying anywhere. So let me go up here first. It's quite a few things to see here. I

1352
05:23:43,639 --> 05:24:24,360
think. By the way, another cracked pot, which I haven't used yet. Living Josh odd. Fun to say

1353
05:24:24,360 --> 05:24:41,159
those words. Nothing else, right? Doesn't look like it. Uh, let me kill this guy out here. This

1354
05:24:41,159 --> 05:25:13,849
thing on it. Wait, dude, how it's fucking aim. What is this aim? How are you shooting me through

1355
05:25:13,849 --> 05:25:44,119
that? What a punk. Seriously, what a punk. Flintstone wet blade. Dude, can you stop this

1356
05:25:44,119 --> 05:26:01,130
raining hell for a second? How many people are standing over here? This is like a thousand people.

1357
05:26:01,849 --> 05:26:28,299
Paul is actually pretty good. Rune fragment. Rune fragment. Grab this guy too.

1358
05:26:29,659 --> 05:26:49,740
You guys up here. I live right next to me. Ristocrat garb. All right. There's an aristocrat

1359
05:26:49,740 --> 05:27:00,860
garb for me. You got invaded by a burger king. I don't think this is even what you said out

1360
05:27:00,860 --> 05:27:11,860
magic by the burger king guy. I'm fine. I don't know why that's making me. It's pissing me off.

1361
05:27:11,860 --> 05:27:15,380
Why is that making me so angry? That's funny. I'm like pissed that you said that.

1362
05:27:16,259 --> 05:27:35,580
I wonder if I can cheese this and just sit on the balcony. Probably can.

1363
05:28:01,979 --> 05:28:05,669
Song sounds like it's from Majora's Mask. So far I've really liked the music.

1364
05:28:06,229 --> 05:28:34,229
It's been really good. Doesn't open on this side. Really. That's a good move. I like it.

1365
05:28:35,029 --> 05:28:50,630
It's staying on the bar. I'm not taking it off. Okay. Is this a decent, decent skip?

1366
05:28:50,630 --> 05:29:12,729
To just run in here? Cool. Apologize to Burger King. What? All right. But I don't. Okay. Maybe

1367
05:29:12,729 --> 05:29:23,430
I'll go the other way first. I got to kill this guy. It's time for cheese ball incorporated.

1368
05:29:26,860 --> 05:29:39,860
Hello. Welcome to cheese ball incorporated. Welcome to the first meeting.

1369
05:30:26,470 --> 05:31:01,340
Crab. Okay. Let's explore over here for a minute. I did not get a chance to look over here. I got

1370
05:31:01,340 --> 05:31:14,810
the thing in the fountain. What about this? Illusory wall. Come on. Really?

1371
05:31:15,770 --> 05:31:52,939
You're getting minus karma. Oh, my head doesn't hurt. Um, it kind of does. This does a lot of

1372
05:31:52,939 --> 05:32:29,720
damage to crabs. What is that bar? Is it sleep? Cool move. Crab eggs. What's wrong with this guy?

1373
05:32:31,340 --> 05:32:46,229
What was that? What was wrong with that guy? Why was he doing that? It was infected with sleep.

1374
05:32:46,229 --> 05:33:05,029
Ah, okay. So I get it. I get it. Where did that crab even come from? Nothing this way.

1375
05:33:05,669 --> 05:33:21,369
See an item over on the ledge. Very interested in. There's some scary sounds coming from over here.

1376
05:33:31,130 --> 05:33:51,139
Golden seed. I probably need two at least. How about over here? There's a balcony that goes up

1377
05:33:51,139 --> 05:34:01,369
that way too. Back over here. I don't think you're high enough for this next area. But do you mean

1378
05:34:01,369 --> 05:34:27,209
like, what do you mean by that? I get to be the Burger King now. Increases intelligence? Wait,

1379
05:34:27,209 --> 05:34:41,209
increases intelligence with the detriment of stamina? I have 27 intelligence now. I actually

1380
05:34:41,209 --> 05:34:55,770
am Burger King. So how much did my- so my stamina is 91 now. That's actually kind of bad. Oh,

1381
05:34:55,770 --> 05:35:14,939
do the dance. All right, let's keep going. I'll keep it on for now. If the stamina is too much

1382
05:35:14,939 --> 05:35:45,720
of a problem, I'll pick it up. Why am I sleeping? I have resistance to sleep because I have so much

1383
05:35:45,720 --> 05:36:27,479
intelligence. That was pretty good timing, I will say. Whoa, cool. All right, I can get that in a

1384
05:36:27,479 --> 05:36:35,400
minute. Somebody little trinkets and little things to do. This game is so cool. Where's my

1385
05:36:35,400 --> 05:36:52,330
stuff over here? You two fight each other. All right, time to kill this guy. I'm gonna do a super

1386
05:36:52,330 --> 05:37:28,810
Q. Ready? Oh, I fell asleep. I don't understand what it even does. I woke right up. Go talk to

1387
05:37:28,810 --> 05:37:34,889
the sorcerer about the gate key. Yeah, I am, but I need to make sure I can get back in here. I'm

1388
05:37:34,889 --> 05:37:40,340
afraid of going to talk to that guy because he'll take the key or something and then I can't get

1389
05:37:40,340 --> 05:37:45,700
back in here, which would be a disaster. It'd be horrible. All right, let me try to get this item

1390
05:37:45,700 --> 05:38:10,819
over here. You got me. Really? You just fish-hooked me. All right, let's get it. Oh,

1391
05:38:12,819 --> 05:38:37,860
oh, good thing I decided to get that item. Oh,

1392
05:38:56,169 --> 05:39:13,479
there's an item down there too. Am I safe here?

1393
05:39:43,099 --> 05:40:01,209
Is it fucking me so many times? I was so far away. I was so far away. It didn't hit me the

1394
05:40:01,209 --> 05:40:09,479
other times. It must roll a certain way. Hold on. Let me go look. Shit. I definitely want whatever

1395
05:40:09,479 --> 05:40:28,599
that is, so I'm gonna get it. It must be a different way I can go. The ball looks like

1396
05:40:28,599 --> 05:40:41,450
it has some like a trajectory, right? It like rolls that way and then curves this way. Bounces

1397
05:40:41,450 --> 05:40:47,299
against this wall. Wait, let me see. Where does that bounce? I'm safe like right here.

1398
05:40:50,150 --> 05:40:55,240
Bounce. Okay, I'm safe right here. So from here, how do I get down there?

1399
05:40:56,659 --> 05:41:10,869
How do I go that way? I'm safe right here. I think. I looked like I was safe right here.

1400
05:41:16,169 --> 05:41:26,250
That's the exact one that I need to upgrade this weapon. Yeah, just run up. I just have to

1401
05:41:26,250 --> 05:41:54,950
weave. Wait. Should be able to get in without too much trouble, I hope. A teleporter.

1402
05:41:58,330 --> 05:42:07,130
There's a port here. I don't want to take this. No, I don't want to take that right now.

1403
05:42:10,729 --> 05:42:14,229
It might. Let me see if there's a bonfire here. I want to be able to come back.

1404
05:42:15,259 --> 05:42:47,560
Moon grum carrion night. He just parried me, you fucking weirdo. We've thinking. Are you dumb?

1405
05:42:48,119 --> 05:43:13,139
Wait, why does he parry? I'm alive. Really? It's so. Look at that.

1406
05:43:15,900 --> 05:43:22,919
No, look at how far away I am too. That's such a pain in the absolute dick. I gotta run up

1407
05:43:22,919 --> 05:43:28,200
the stupid thing again. That guy. I'm so pissed. That guy's dead. Yeah, guess what? I can do that

1408
05:43:28,200 --> 05:43:59,290
too, you know. No, I'm going to fucking pull his ass. I need to use it. I will. It's so embarrassing

1409
05:43:59,290 --> 05:44:37,450
when you get parried, especially when it's from a non playable character. Same moves that I do.

1410
05:44:41,619 --> 05:44:53,959
Fucking parried again. It's a fucking what the fuck? I'm doing it. I'm getting up there and I'm

1411
05:44:53,959 --> 05:44:59,560
going to do the same thing to this goddamn asshole. I'm going to parry you now. You're getting parried

1412
05:44:59,560 --> 05:45:18,860
now. It's your turn. Where are my souls? Okay, right. You're just getting outplayed. Yeah,

1413
05:45:18,860 --> 05:45:23,500
I feel like this is what happens when I play online. If I ever go invade anybody, I just get

1414
05:45:23,500 --> 05:45:30,389
embarrassed. I would much rather be the purple guy during an invasion that just kind of runs around

1415
05:45:30,389 --> 05:45:35,349
and just like swings and stuff and hurts somebody once and then just runs off a cliff. That's the

1416
05:45:35,349 --> 05:45:53,080
kind of support invader I am. Purple guy from Dark Souls. You know, you can be a purple phantom.

1417
05:45:56,569 --> 05:46:07,259
All right, dick. Let's go. Look at how predictable your swings are too.

1418
05:46:10,419 --> 05:46:34,470
See how good you handle this shit. Mr. Predictable. Oh look, it's Mr. Predictable. There you are.

1419
05:46:34,470 --> 05:46:53,580
I can do the same move. So this guy, you don't just don't swing your weapon out. Just don't

1420
05:46:53,580 --> 05:47:04,389
swing at him because he's going to parry every single R1. Oh, that hurts big time. I can't. Okay,

1421
05:47:04,389 --> 05:47:12,459
so just do not R1 ever. Uh, I was expecting that, but if I knocked him down when he got up,

1422
05:47:12,459 --> 05:47:16,060
he wasn't going to immediately just parry. Usually you have like a few seconds to swing.

1423
05:47:17,020 --> 05:47:22,900
Just lead him into the ball. No, I want to beat him one on one because I want to embarrass him

1424
05:47:22,900 --> 05:47:31,540
on stream. I want this guy to lose and then go look at the chat. What are they saying about me?

1425
05:47:31,540 --> 05:47:37,560
Like open up, open German 95. Everyone's like, omega low, omega low shit on him. Omega low. Wow.

1426
05:47:37,560 --> 05:47:42,680
Like omega low. Like, you know, that kind of stuff. Like, wow, you lost a German. Holy shit.

1427
05:47:42,680 --> 05:48:10,279
Like fucking delete your fucking save file. Let's go. You can't parry those. Stop trying.

1428
05:48:11,159 --> 05:48:39,099
Oh, my mom. That was definitely a good time to do that. You're not listening to NPC. Quiet.

1429
05:48:40,139 --> 05:49:13,659
Holy shit. That probably was an instant kill. Don't do it. Don't do it. This guy's going to

1430
05:49:13,659 --> 05:50:47,180
get crushed by a fucking bowling ball in five minutes. What the fuck? No, what? What are you

1431
05:50:47,180 --> 05:51:25,509
talking about? You don't have the mana to do that move. I kind of want that move though. It's

1432
05:51:25,509 --> 05:51:35,139
actually really good. He probably drops it. All right. New strategy. It's called stand in this.

1433
05:51:35,139 --> 05:51:39,319
I got it. I know what I'm doing. I'm going to stand in a safe place and just like fucking

1434
05:51:39,319 --> 05:51:42,040
dodge around. And again, he's going to get hit by the bowling ball like three times.

1435
05:51:42,840 --> 05:52:06,259
I'm just going to block. Thankfully, my souls are right here. What was wrong with that? Like I'm so

1436
05:52:06,259 --> 05:52:10,419
tilted that that didn't parry. What happened? What was wrong with that? I don't understand.

1437
05:52:11,139 --> 05:53:16,139
That was like almost perfect. He's spamming now. Crush him. He just taunted me.

1438
05:53:17,500 --> 05:53:43,779
Intelligence scaling. What? Excel's been facing magic or holy attacks. Just who were these knights

1439
05:53:43,779 --> 05:54:06,299
to prepare fight for? I don't get it. What does it mean? It's like a magic shield. Okay.

1440
05:54:09,770 --> 05:54:21,060
Okay, you've lost to Jerma. Is he in chat right now? Dude, like, fuck you, dude.

1441
05:54:25,459 --> 05:54:29,619
Like, I like playing against people and shit, but like taunting like in the middle of a match.

1442
05:54:29,619 --> 05:54:35,130
Like you're a fucking shitty. Like, I don't know. I don't think I need to tell you that.

1443
05:54:40,840 --> 05:54:46,740
Blocks magic. That seems like it's going to be pretty useful. All right. Wait, is this a shortcut?

1444
05:54:50,200 --> 05:55:03,110
Yes, that was an NPC. Yes, it was an NPC. That's not a real person. Is this a shortcut to something?

1445
05:55:03,110 --> 05:55:28,790
Where am I? I'm scared to open this door. I'm kind of afraid to open this. Let me try the other way

1446
05:55:28,790 --> 05:55:40,040
first. Yeah, that feels like a boss door. A big one. So I'm not going there yet. There's another

1447
05:55:40,040 --> 05:55:56,779
way to go this way. I still have enough. I still have plenty of health. I'm not scared. I've got a

1448
05:55:56,779 --> 05:56:03,099
lot of runes too. I'll be able to level up one more time. Probably putting in into endurance.

1449
05:56:05,750 --> 05:56:14,310
Maybe. Or vitality again. I need to get vitality to at least 20. There's also the portal. Yeah.

1450
05:56:14,310 --> 05:56:19,349
Well, if I get a new bonfire, then yeah, obviously. I don't want to get teleported

1451
05:56:19,349 --> 05:56:34,729
across the whole game. Well, I guess it's not that far. Oh, okay. No, get me out of here because

1452
05:56:34,729 --> 05:56:45,000
this is... I know where this is. Wait, I've been here before, right? Have I been here before? Yes,

1453
05:56:45,000 --> 05:56:51,500
I have. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, that's a skip to get back there quickly. All right. I'm

1454
05:56:51,500 --> 05:57:07,139
glad I got that. Cool. Okay. I'm going to put it into vitality or get intelligence to 25. What do

1455
05:57:07,139 --> 05:57:33,430
you think? 25 intelligence. Let's do it. Into mind for OLED. Still don't have enough. Pinball

1456
05:57:33,430 --> 05:57:38,069
route actually might be better. Yeah, it actually might be because this seems very dangerous. Let's

1457
05:57:38,069 --> 05:58:02,389
try it. Yeah, I'll get into 25. Oh my... And then I'll stop intelligent. I'm going to stop putting

1458
05:58:02,389 --> 05:58:08,630
points into intelligence now. Now I'm going to focus on vigor, mind, and maybe a little bit of

1459
05:58:08,630 --> 05:58:19,459
endurance. That's where it goes there. So let's try this skip and see what it looks like. I could

1460
05:58:19,459 --> 05:58:24,900
do the portal, but let me just see what's in that room so I can have the boss revealed maybe.

1461
05:58:25,860 --> 05:58:43,139
See how hard this is to do. This kind of seems like a horrible way to go. I mean, I guess if

1462
05:58:43,139 --> 05:58:48,500
you get through there, it's a little bit, maybe a tiny bit faster. Not really though. Not really

1463
05:58:48,500 --> 05:58:57,799
at all. What are you going to do with this bullshit right here? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

1464
05:58:58,680 --> 05:59:16,939
leave me alone for a second. Uh, I can jump to that. What's this? Interesting.

1465
05:59:34,630 --> 05:59:42,169
Uh, I'm confused. What's the... That brings a bowling ball actually turns out to be faster

1466
05:59:42,169 --> 05:59:56,169
potentially. What if I go up the ladder? Hey, say it's my brother's birthday. My cousin's birthday.

1467
05:59:56,169 --> 06:00:55,750
Your favorite. Say his name. Ball sack. There's no backstab. I gotta get up there. Yeah, this is

1468
06:00:55,750 --> 06:01:13,909
definitely the better way to go. It's just not really that dangerous. Onion head. I would call

1469
06:01:13,909 --> 06:01:34,779
that a clam head. That's definitely a clam head. You gotta hug the crap. Let's try that again.

1470
06:01:35,340 --> 06:01:46,419
Only this time. Not mess it up. I think I'm going to kill one of the sorcerers first.

1471
06:01:46,979 --> 06:01:50,709
You know what I mean? Just like sneak up right here and just go with this.

1472
06:02:23,659 --> 06:02:50,099
Ooh, that's a new staff, but I don't know. Who's casting? Dude, that came out of his penis. What?

1473
06:02:50,099 --> 06:03:02,950
What? Where did this person come from? Where did you come from? Did you climb up the ladder?

1474
06:03:09,799 --> 06:03:12,200
Sanctuary stone. All right, we got some stuff to look at.

1475
06:03:27,110 --> 06:03:42,889
Lintstone scarab. A helmet? Blue green scarab worn directly on the head. Slightly reduced the

1476
06:03:42,889 --> 06:03:48,950
FB cost of sorcery increases damage taken. Oh my God. You're gonna be like a bug head.

1477
06:03:49,750 --> 06:04:02,779
This is weird. Okay, but just take damage taken. I don't know about that.

1478
06:04:03,259 --> 06:04:10,459
I think I like the Burger King helmet better. This is just intelligence. Which helps my weapon

1479
06:04:10,459 --> 06:04:25,740
too, not just my sorceries. I think it's better overall. Any secret rooms? I don't even know

1480
06:04:25,740 --> 06:04:45,880
where the fuck that guy came from. I think that's it. Okay, carrying glint blade staff or academy

1481
06:04:45,880 --> 06:04:53,770
staff. Staff of the academy embedded with a turquoise glint stone. Only a recognized sorcerer

1482
06:04:53,770 --> 06:05:09,900
is permitted to wield this staff. Damage? It's a little heavier. It has B scaling.

1483
06:05:12,790 --> 06:05:22,259
This is plus one and it's 131. This is zero and it's 130. I don't know. Just look at this one

1484
06:05:22,259 --> 06:05:28,889
though. Boost glint blade sorcery? This doesn't do anything. Scaling is all that matters. How

1485
06:05:28,889 --> 06:05:39,930
much does this boost sorcery though? That's a good question. I'll have to do a little bit of testing

1486
06:05:39,930 --> 06:06:06,020
on that. Oh man, I can go down here. Golden rune. Okay, and there's the teleporter. All right,

1487
06:06:06,740 --> 06:06:37,700
I'm going in. Marina of the lakes. This supported me here. Okay. Ooh, all right. Well, I got a new

1488
06:06:37,700 --> 06:06:51,270
school. Rest here. This game is too big. I mean, this game is very large. It's very big. All right,

1489
06:06:51,270 --> 06:07:04,919
what is this? Church of vows. What's this place? Is this an NPC? Is this an NPC? Is this a pope

1490
06:07:04,919 --> 06:07:24,970
turtle? I have no idea.

1491
06:07:41,540 --> 06:07:49,750
That the great houses of the earth tree and the moon by the matrimonial red-haired

1492
06:07:49,750 --> 06:08:01,770
radican and so our church holds in view the monuments of both houses the earth tree of the

1493
06:08:01,770 --> 06:08:14,279
capital and the academy are one are one are one are one are one was there something you yourself

1494
06:08:14,279 --> 06:08:24,759
around would serve as your guide only my legs aren't what used to be free to take it with you

1495
06:08:24,759 --> 06:08:30,759
really unless perhaps you are in search of instruction in which case i will share all

1496
06:08:30,759 --> 06:08:40,040
that i know probably faith you got oh my goodness gracious oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god

1497
06:08:43,580 --> 06:08:58,869
i have scrolls to give you but wait did i magic lint blade creates a sigil that forms a projectile

1498
06:08:58,869 --> 06:09:04,939
i already have that arian greatsword forms a sweeping slash using magical greatsword

1499
06:09:04,939 --> 06:09:20,810
that thing's good 10 000 souls give scroll academy scroll what have we let us both learn

1500
06:09:20,810 --> 06:09:28,169
together heresy is not native to the world it is but a contrivance awesome this guy's a summon

1501
06:09:28,330 --> 06:09:42,229
this can be swift glintstone swiftly fires magic rate glintstone oh we got red flintstone

1502
06:09:58,810 --> 06:10:13,860
jesus our shower i just got chills i'm fucking excited all right hold on

1503
06:10:25,939 --> 06:10:44,540
old sewing needle golden tailoring tools all right anything else here that i can take

1504
06:10:52,740 --> 06:10:59,049
no all right so i gotta remember where this guy is so this over here yeah the church of vows is

1505
06:10:59,049 --> 06:11:09,659
where i gotta go uh because some of those are probably really powerful let me ask about uh

1506
06:11:09,659 --> 06:11:20,139
radigan wish to know more was a great champ possessed of flowing the wolf he came to these

1507
06:11:20,139 --> 06:11:28,380
lands at the head of a great ghost when he met lady ranana in battle he soon repented his

1508
06:11:29,099 --> 06:11:36,869
aggressions there became husband to the car first

1509
06:11:37,590 --> 06:11:52,229
radigan left renala coming queen marika's second husband and king consort taking the title of

1510
06:11:52,229 --> 06:12:00,759
second elden lord mystery endures to this day as to why lord radigan would cast lady renala

1511
06:12:00,759 --> 06:12:05,720
people are turning into animals or something because that was a wolf person this guy's a

1512
06:12:06,279 --> 06:12:22,439
for the seat of dalton she is queen or family the academy of that's definitely the boss

1513
06:12:22,439 --> 06:12:29,500
eight and beautiful full moon which sadly her heart was broken when lord radigan left her

1514
06:12:29,500 --> 06:12:41,259
when the academy rebelled against them yeah that's definitely the door okay all right uh i did buy

1515
06:12:41,259 --> 06:12:45,419
this one so let's go let's go get it put on the bar and let's test it

1516
06:12:46,139 --> 06:13:03,819
right against the brown mushrooms of adult is free alter garments what did i just do

1517
06:13:04,459 --> 06:13:18,549
i don't know do that all right what it takes the cloak off just taking off the cloak and reducing

1518
06:13:18,549 --> 06:13:36,979
the defense why would you do that it seems kind of like a bad idea all right this is i need 52

1519
06:13:36,979 --> 06:13:41,540
intelligence for this and there's no way i'm going to be able to have that now but i can do great

1520
06:13:41,540 --> 06:14:02,169
glint stone shard test it that is big slow but let's how much damage does it do it's short range

1521
06:14:03,450 --> 06:14:31,189
346 fucking damage okay i'll keep it there for now that's a lot of mana so i can also upgrade

1522
06:14:31,189 --> 06:14:38,119
my weapon i believe so here's what we're gonna do i'm just gonna go kill some stuff actually no

this yeah in detailing sewing needle grants choice of affinity upgrade to weapon

1538
06:17:39,400 --> 06:17:47,380
when applying an affinity using physical and magic type ashes of war and infinity

1548

unsure of what i might be able to accomplish spirit tuning if i might be able to help you all

1549
06:20:16,500 --> 06:20:22,299
i'd certainly like to try and if there's any chance to ease the suffering of my dear men who were

1550
06:20:22,299 --> 06:20:29,740
grafted well i certainly must try boderica the spirit tune apprentice pleased to make your

06:29:43,540 --> 06:30:24,389
that just reminded me of the boys wow where is the last one over there this might be phase one

1580
06:30:24,389 --> 06:30:33,689
because this is actually really not a big deal phase one or is that just the deacons yeah of

1581
06:30:33,689 --> 06:31:09,639
course it is

1582
06:31:12,279 --> 06:31:27,479
well not gonna be fun is it upon my name is rani the witch

1583
06:31:31,180 --> 06:31:35,020
mother's rich slumber shall not be disturbed by thee

1584
06:31:35,500 --> 06:31:38,220
of course let's go

1585
06:31:40,860 --> 06:31:47,700
that's gonna be such a pain in the ass i have to do that bullshit run around smack people let's

1586
06:31:47,700 --> 06:31:56,919
just beat her first try which that means magic that means panic dodging of the last queen of karya

1587
06:31:57,959 --> 06:32:07,110
loves the of the night she conjured

1588
06:32:21,180 --> 06:33:13,659
holy shit she's got a power beam oh that's slow as shit bro all right okay i'm sure she's a spammer

1589
06:33:14,299 --> 06:33:29,509
right use the magic shield i wonder how much that eats damage though i was i was i kind of

1590
06:33:29,509 --> 06:33:34,659
want to see what you did well that phase one is gonna be such a pain in the ass to do over and

1591
06:33:34,659 --> 06:33:45,430
over again there's some of the boys for that one okay well i i can do that much quicker though

1592
06:33:45,430 --> 06:33:49,990
because you don't have to kill them just to walk around and break walk around break break break

1593
06:33:49,990 --> 06:34:11,830
break break i feel like once you depending on how much that eats damage those slow ones might i

1594
06:34:11,830 --> 06:34:16,810
might be able to eat them all what about the break oh shit that's right i i'll do it after this

1595
06:34:37,610 --> 06:34:43,290
unless okay if she does not do anything more ridiculous than that this might not be that big

1596
06:34:43,290 --> 06:34:53,740
of a problem let's try this again this time i know exactly what has to happen in the first

1597
06:34:53,740 --> 06:35:00,680
phase just kind of run around i really shouldn't need to get hit that much here let's find out

1598
06:35:01,639 --> 06:36:40,200
greedy where are you where are you where where is it oh my god where are you you piece of crap

1599
06:36:51,139 --> 06:37:04,950

1600
06:37:04,950 --> 06:37:16,979
lock on to her you can't lock on to her when she's down there dumb dumb like i'm thinking r1

1601
06:37:16,979 --> 06:37:37,979
like right stick r1 right it won't work that's so annoying you would have been dead can't lock on

1602
06:37:37,979 --> 06:37:49,130
to the lady in the bubble oh my god stupid god damn deacon bullshit where is the oh yeah i'm

1603
06:37:49,130 --> 06:38:08,250
hiding behind him oh can't see me yeah you can't lock on to her although you can but sorry there's

1604
06:38:08,250 --> 06:38:14,819
like 30 people in the world do you want to walk in lock on or what are the other 40 people that

1605
06:38:17,479 --> 06:38:35,639
all right let's go okay running is good for that what does this do what does this do what does that

1606
06:38:35,639 --> 06:38:51,659
do why is there like a moon here now how much does it defend it's not that great i don't know

1607
06:38:51,659 --> 06:39:15,450
i'm not i'm not a fan i'm not a fan god you're so fucking annoying should i attack that i don't i

1608
06:39:15,450 --> 06:39:47,430
have no idea it's running left the strategy kind of you said get i'm gonna get in close

1609
06:39:47,430 --> 06:40:09,450
i'm gonna get in close she goes oh flasks yeah that's a good call flask and p yeah yep yep yep

1610
06:40:09,450 --> 06:40:23,459
yep absolutely i'll be right back i'm gonna be really quick i'm not gonna be long i'll be right

1611
06:40:23,459 --> 06:42:37,369
back i didn't put any music on oops all right let's do it i told you that was gonna be quick

1612
06:42:37,930 --> 06:43:03,270
i got a refill of water all right can somebody tell me how many runes this is how many do i get

1613
06:43:03,270 --> 06:43:25,669
i don't know this is golden rune seven is it 10k 2200 maybe 2500 you know all right let's do it

1614
06:43:27,909 --> 06:43:35,750
oh it tells you if you sell it a merchant okay so the next strategy that i'm gonna try is i'm

1615
06:43:35,750 --> 06:43:42,700
gonna stay just as close as possible i'm just gonna go i'm just gonna run sprint directly like

1616
06:43:42,700 --> 06:43:48,779
right into her stomach stay there i ain't going anywhere i'm gonna try to just just keep the gap

1617
06:43:48,779 --> 06:43:54,939
closed just kind of just pivot around her dodge around how much longer you're gonna be streaming

1618
06:43:54,939 --> 06:44:06,939
after the last break probably an hour or two maybe somewhere on like the eight hour mark maybe it

1619
06:44:06,939 --> 06:44:12,220
depends it depends on how long this takes it depends on if i can beat this tonight if i beat

1620
06:44:12,220 --> 06:44:24,790
this this will probably be the last thing i do if i win so if whenever this happens uh that's

1621
06:44:24,790 --> 06:44:30,389
probably gonna be the end stream but i mean i spent like an hour and 20 minutes on the first

1622
06:44:30,389 --> 06:44:37,049
boss of the game so we'll see how long that takes stream tomorrow or rest day i'll be live tomorrow

1623
06:44:37,049 --> 06:44:43,450
okay no dumb mistakes let's go

1624
06:46:54,869 --> 06:47:03,979
close the gap i wish it didn't take so long to load you're getting me out of my rhythm

1625
06:47:03,979 --> 06:47:56,299
what is your hitbox are you serious you're like all clothing this i'm i don't know what this is

1626
06:47:56,860 --> 06:48:05,299
i wonder if i should hit it okay all right so now i know what that fucking thing is it's a big bomb

1627
06:48:05,299 --> 06:48:43,700
if you touch it it explodes all right she does okay spins she'll throw it out all right watch out

1628
06:48:43,700 --> 06:49:24,950
for this goddamn thing come on boys what the fuck are you talking about oh fuck you i'm not dealing

1629
06:49:24,950 --> 06:49:54,150
with this bullshit what the fuck come here you're the one doing the incantation what the fuck is

1630
06:49:54,150 --> 06:50:18,740
happening i don't know if i would qualify in this fair fight get her okay that was fucking

1631
06:50:18,740 --> 06:50:30,900
horseshit hit them once they'll go down in one hit if i hit her do they disappear i feel like that

1632
06:50:30,900 --> 06:50:45,849
might be a better idea no okay they're all one hit kills and you have to dodge all of her other

1633
06:50:45,849 --> 06:50:52,950
bullshit that she does because she still casts spells okay well i now i understand what's going

1634
06:50:52,950 --> 06:51:06,520
on here you had the boys you're summoning giants i have a guy i have okay three guys with torches

1635
06:51:06,520 --> 06:51:14,279
and two guys with rusty shovels i don't think is the equivalent of a gigantic 55 foot tall

1636
06:51:14,279 --> 06:51:31,419
monster with a club so that first phase though was that was the absolutely the play

1637
06:51:33,159 --> 06:51:36,919
all that projectile spam as long as you just close the gap and you and you get right

1638
06:51:37,560 --> 06:51:43,560
right up kind of right in her um none of it will hit you the second phase though that's

1639
06:51:43,560 --> 06:51:49,000
a different story because you have to dodge all the other bullshit from the people she summons

1640
06:51:50,520 --> 06:52:27,669
dude i i fucking the lock on is gonna make me shit my pants i can't tell what's better r2

1641
06:52:27,669 --> 06:52:45,990
or just r1 spin it's hard to tell oh my god this this is so fucking annoying why

1642
06:52:46,950 --> 06:53:05,080
does that go through walls the thing that she does watch out

1643
06:53:09,450 --> 06:53:16,169
from software loves these like wicked annoying fights in the game oh i have an idea what's that

1644
06:53:16,169 --> 06:53:22,409
first phase be like just run around in circles while shit spams at you and you break the bubble

1645
06:53:22,409 --> 06:53:26,729
and now the lady comes out and then you fight the real boss then you fight the real fucking

1646
06:53:26,729 --> 06:54:26,459
boss i'm tilted i'm tilted right now i used two flasks already this is a disaster all right you

1647
06:54:26,459 --> 06:54:47,669
can't hit her more than once i'm worth trying oh my god they hit me twice fucker

1648
06:54:51,000 --> 06:55:29,909
hey i'm running fucking through you and she turns i thought she stays in the same spot

1649
06:55:30,549 --> 06:56:18,069
i thought it was one hit i thought it was one hit i don't think that's accurate inaccurate

1650
06:56:18,069 --> 06:56:46,380
inaccurate testing inaccurate testing you just have to avoid it god damn it can't even go near

1651
06:56:46,380 --> 06:57:36,090
this motherfucker it's such a random dog shit where does it there's no scenery on this second

1652
06:57:36,090 --> 06:57:54,439
stage why are you losing god damn it how dare you that's exactly what you wanted oh sorry but um

1653
06:57:55,240 --> 06:58:02,680
she spawns she spawns random ghouls and ghosts that will just attack you and you just have to

1654
06:58:02,680 --> 06:58:11,459
avoid them and attack her she spawned that guy that huge guy came and clubbed me in the back of

1655
06:58:11,459 --> 06:58:29,939
the skull from behind me i didn't even know where he was i gotta keep i gotta send this back down

1656
06:58:29,939 --> 06:58:37,259
hitting them once is true i hit that dragon like four times and he was still there should we go

1657
06:58:37,259 --> 06:58:49,979
casting versus casting it's worth a shot it's probably worth a shot see what happens although

1658
06:58:49,979 --> 06:58:56,020
i gotta stand still for a lot of that which is probably not gonna happen they disappear after a

1659
06:58:56,020 --> 06:59:12,630
moment yeah but they still exist which is like oh my god i can't hear anything sleep tidal lullabies

1660
06:59:12,630 --> 06:59:49,959
are scary lullabies are spooky probably hiding behind a goddamn bench somewhere over here

1661
06:59:50,759 --> 07:00:06,310
where something in my nose and i'm gonna pick it out in a second where is this person

1662
07:00:07,029 --> 07:00:16,939
god that throw dice in the fucking air where is this person where the fuck is this person

1663
07:00:17,659 --> 07:00:38,470
god kill me kill me kill me i can't use a flask here kill me i really okay i really wish i could

1664
07:00:38,470 --> 07:00:44,549
just beat this part like 30 times and then it was just like okay you've done it sir you can just go

1665
07:00:44,549 --> 07:01:07,740
to you can just do the actual fight now we just go right to the fight do you have a crossbow or

1666
07:01:07,740 --> 07:01:13,659
something um i i mean it's it's just orangey right it's like okay you're gonna get a good

1667
07:01:13,659 --> 07:01:20,060
roll here and is is it gonna is one of them gonna be behind a bookshelf with it or is it gonna be

1668
07:01:20,060 --> 07:01:32,630
like one of the thousand and a half people that are in the middle use the big wide range spell

1669
07:01:32,630 --> 07:01:38,380
i'm curious if the big one will hurt a lot because there are moments where i get like a second to

1670
07:01:38,380 --> 07:01:59,580
cast it i'm curious if it would get if it does a lot i would not last one fight in this game

1671
07:01:59,580 --> 07:02:08,150
without crying magic doesn't i would imagine magic probably is not that great considering uh

1672
07:02:08,869 --> 07:02:16,630
her repertoire of abilities now i got what i need i you know the could i probably get this to plus

1673
07:02:16,630 --> 07:03:37,349
five weapon maybe i'm not giving up yet i think our one's better i think our one's better i really

1674
07:03:37,349 --> 07:05:00,360
do all right before she does the move sleep tight you fucking wanker i tried to dodge but he went it

1675
07:05:00,360 --> 07:05:45,880
instead boys i'm like blood wig i'm like blood wig no stop putting my hand up to go i don't have to

1676
07:05:45,880 --> 07:05:53,400
do it i don't have to call them in real life i don't have to go like this stop fucking putting

1677
07:05:53,400 --> 07:05:58,279
my hands up i'm like i can't stop though i don't know why because i here's the thing listen

1678
07:05:59,860 --> 07:06:13,860
ah it takes like one two three anyways so that's like me going like let's go boys

1679
07:06:14,979 --> 07:06:22,580
is the same it doesn't not like i'm actively not playing it it has to cast so it's not like it's a

1680
07:06:22,580 --> 07:06:29,099
problem it's just like i don't know i just have to do it every time you're a clown at heart i was

1681
07:06:29,099 --> 07:06:35,740
doing pretty good that time though but the that's the problem calling out the summons it takes so

1682
07:06:35,740 --> 07:06:50,299
long that you just in a bad position pretty much no matter what i keep calling i keep calling out

1683
07:06:50,299 --> 07:06:56,200
boys like ludwig i swear to god i didn't even realize that's what's been happening this whole

1684
07:06:56,200 --> 07:07:13,319
time okay come on man that was a pretty good run that was not a bad one so i'm gonna right before

1685
07:07:13,319 --> 07:07:44,900
the phase change they'll come really all right that's good to know yeah our one's way better

1686
07:07:51,189 --> 07:08:09,750
people that put the fire on the ground buried behind a fucking wall somewhere where are you

1687
07:08:09,750 --> 07:08:18,299
you piece of shit does this block it does this block it will it actually block does this block

1688
07:08:19,020 --> 07:08:29,419
does this block does this block will it will line of sight block the stupid holy fire thing

1689
07:08:29,419 --> 07:08:59,590
that she's about to do why did i just get steam notifications you got it can't you can't get it

1690
07:08:59,590 --> 07:09:18,709
into past you can't get it into i just tried to get it into nope get out of the way before

1691
07:09:18,709 --> 07:09:52,650
she kills me with that stupid move sleep time sleep time reset mother fucker hold on i got why

1692
07:09:52,650 --> 07:09:58,840
am i in steam why why am i logged into fucking steam i'm not i'm not even logged into steam

1693
07:10:09,029 --> 07:10:25,720
that was a throw i had to why stop because i got i i can't lose a health flask you had seven

1694
07:10:25,720 --> 07:10:30,520
heals yeah but i had a full health bar gone it was gonna take one and a half to get rid of it

1695
07:10:30,520 --> 07:10:43,400
no i cannot use a flask on that phase i can't i can't use flask you're getting bodied by the

1696
07:10:43,400 --> 07:10:52,310
easiest main boss i'll time that person off for 10 minutes because they haven't seen phase two

1697
07:10:55,939 --> 07:11:12,970
how dare you come in here and say that without seeing phase two phase two stupid phase two

1698
07:11:12,970 --> 07:11:18,919
oh i know phase two is doable it's annoying but it's doable i just hate it doesn't matter how much

1699
07:11:18,919 --> 07:11:23,799
i go on on i go on the fucking from software forums and i say hey look i'm just i'm a gamer

1700
07:11:23,799 --> 07:11:29,720
and i'm a big fan i what i would really like to see is is no more of these free boss fight boss

1701
07:11:29,720 --> 07:11:34,759
fights where just random shit happens and then you fight the boss i i would appreciate if that

1702
07:11:34,759 --> 07:11:38,279
would never show up in one of these from software games again otherwise i will withhold my money

1703
07:11:39,159 --> 07:12:08,099
you just got downvoted you have negative they had negative like 400 upvotes i am telling you right

1704
07:12:08,099 --> 07:12:16,180
now i don't know why it has to be the same color i thought that was a person and i turned over here

1705
07:12:16,180 --> 07:12:22,099
immediately and what ended up happening is i got hit by the chandelier because i walked initially

1706
07:12:22,099 --> 07:12:28,970
this way because it's a yellow fucking thing on my screen just reset reset reset reset i'm

1707
07:12:28,970 --> 07:12:38,060
not wasting two fucking potions see what i mean oh you're not going to say i'm a big fan of like

1708
07:12:38,060 --> 07:12:42,700
when like you just throw random shit on every fucking inch of the screen and you know be careful

1709
07:12:42,700 --> 07:12:46,939
though you get up you can't memorize it because it just goes everywhere and then by the way i'd

1710
07:12:46,939 --> 07:12:51,259
love a boss that summons other bosses and other enemies at the same time that you're fighting

1711
07:12:51,979 --> 07:12:55,580
which can she can do in less than a tenth of a second but you take for you to summon the

1712
07:12:55,580 --> 07:12:59,740
the boys uh it's really annoying it takes me four seconds to do that when it should be pretty much

1713
07:12:59,740 --> 07:13:23,740
instant you said you wanted the other story bosses to be different no i know i think it's

1714
07:13:23,740 --> 07:13:32,090
not a bad encounter no i think i think this is actually one of like the you know i love like

1715

1728
07:17:48,459 --> 07:18:03,099

of 10 000 people this is the motherfucker with the books it's the fuckers with the books and i'm

1732
07:18:48,520 --> 07:19:13,340

07:20:18,169 --> 07:20:35,340
i don't hear anything i don't hear any singing i don't hear any i don't hear any singing

1734
07:20:36,060 --> 07:20:53,830

1735
07:20:53,830 --> 07:21:37,799

1736
07:21:38,599 --> 07:22:15,529
bye guys the boys are actually fucking this up i don't the patterns are weird it goes around

1737
07:22:15,529 --> 07:24:24,380
her left side get it right what is it hey i dodged it you fool giant giant giant giant

1738
07:24:25,020 --> 07:25:23,029
get that balloon shit out of here god damn it the fucking it's so stressful that the

1739
07:25:23,110 --> 07:25:29,779
fucking dog's behind me i got it i got it i got it i got it i got it it's just like

1740
07:25:29,779 --> 07:25:34,020
trying to fucking find the right spot to be in when you're just somebody's just running behind

1741
07:25:34,020 --> 07:25:45,830
you i want to fight the boss not the dickheads that she summons to the party all right all right

1742
07:25:45,830 --> 07:26:00,069
let's go let's go let's go let's go let's go use your spells they'll do negative damage

1743
07:26:11,419 --> 07:26:15,659
so okay there's four things that she brings out unless there's something i haven't seen

1744
07:26:16,900 --> 07:26:23,220
there's a giant which spawns right behind you and swings down two or three seconds after she

1745
07:26:23,220 --> 07:26:29,909
spawns it it's always behind you you literally can't see it the dogs are probably the worst one

1746
07:26:29,909 --> 07:26:34,549
or the dragon because the dragons are so huge the dragon flies up in the air making it like a huge

1747
07:26:34,549 --> 07:26:37,909
pain in the ass you have to like just try to dodge that i think the dogs and the dragon are the worst

1748
07:26:37,909 --> 07:26:44,709
ones i don't know if it's rng or not a little like slimy like squirrely guy that is on the

1749
07:26:44,709 --> 07:26:59,189
ground with the blades you just have to run away i could try i could try a different summon yeah

1750
07:26:59,189 --> 07:28:16,139
that one was close how do you already have the bubble on you good rng right there your stupid

1751
07:28:16,700 --> 07:28:53,139
your stupid fucking voice line is talking over the singing behind something what new plan

1752
07:28:53,939 --> 07:29:06,470
the boys are gonna get summoned when she goes into the moon for the first time when she goes

1753
07:29:06,470 --> 07:30:14,119
into the moon boom i do say boom what a dip shit what the fuck was that homing missile it's

1754
07:30:14,119 --> 07:31:16,470
just fucking holding myself get her oh no dragon all right where is he you got come on dude like

1755
07:31:16,470 --> 07:31:24,069
you can't even see where the fucking where he goes it's like you i have to i have to look at

1756
07:31:24,069 --> 07:31:37,540
him i can't just guess that was a good one too i could hear her casting but like it's either she's

1757
07:31:37,540 --> 07:31:42,340
gonna cast a spell and i have to dodge it or i'm gonna dodge the spell and this guy that just goes

1758
07:31:42,340 --> 07:31:55,049
into the fucking skybox is gonna land on me and kill me can you use your horse no unfortunately

1759
07:31:55,049 --> 07:32:01,419
i would love to get on the horse i thought i thought that was gonna be the one i really did

1760
07:32:02,060 --> 07:32:14,630
ignore the dragon when he goes up but if i ignore the dragon when he goes up he's gonna come down

1761
07:32:14,630 --> 07:32:20,779
and land and it's gonna it does like i think 70 or 80 percent of your health bar and then i'm like

1762
07:32:20,779 --> 07:32:32,360
in a bad position she might already have a spell out dragon won't land on her i think it already

1763
07:32:32,360 --> 07:32:41,159
has the wolves are more aggressive i'll try the wolves that same exact strategy is going to apply

1764
07:32:41,159 --> 07:32:56,220
though he goes into the little thing wait till she goes in and then go for it bro just run when the

1765
07:32:56,220 --> 07:33:00,779
dragon crumbs yeah but the dragon the dragon the dragon's like as big as the whole screen

1766
07:33:03,930 --> 07:33:07,689
like it don't really matter where he lands he's gonna land he's probably gonna land on

1767
07:33:08,650 --> 07:33:55,979
you can't see him god you bastard don't do it don't do it don't do it don't do it

1768
07:33:57,099 --> 07:34:02,409
don't do it i want to use the heal but i have to

1769
07:35:29,560 --> 07:35:51,799
aggression get her get her no moves don't let her do any moves call it out what is it why can i hit

1770
07:35:51,799 --> 07:36:35,110
these fucking things he just ate that whole thing get that fucking thing away from me okay i need to

1771
07:36:35,110 --> 07:36:55,529
be able to see both of your asses you don't get two right oh please you can't even do that

1772
07:37:00,790 --> 07:37:40,729
giant dudes just stop do fucking something else god i haven't been able to go even near her

1773
07:37:41,290 --> 07:38:09,529
piece of shit i'm dead like dude like she kept spawning people one after the other after the

1774
07:38:09,529 --> 07:38:14,099
other after the other after the other it's like how am i supposed how you supposed to fight this

1775
07:38:14,099 --> 07:38:36,330
just fucking random dice roll bullshit you can interrupt the summons she does it so fast that

1776
07:38:36,330 --> 07:38:47,380
like it is a knockback on it it's just okay she spawned another thing when the dragon was

1777
07:38:47,380 --> 07:39:01,990
just still there i wonder if that's just a thing that she can just do maybe bleed weapons i mean

1778
07:39:01,990 --> 07:39:10,439
it's too late for that it really is i've already spent all my stones upgrading this thing i am

1779
07:39:10,439 --> 07:39:18,279
she's close okay here's what's gonna have to happen i have to get favorable rng no like dragon

1780
07:39:18,279 --> 07:39:24,439
then giant then dragon then dogs then guy like i need like at least a two or three moves in

1781
07:39:24,439 --> 07:39:37,639
between she did that like stupid beam thing and i couldn't get close to her and you hop over the

1782
07:39:37,639 --> 07:39:42,919
summoning circle you probably can but i she still summons it i wonder if there's maybe there is a

1783
07:39:42,919 --> 07:41:21,740
way to stagger maybe try r2 i'll give it a try that's gonna explode oh come the fuck on with

1784
07:41:21,740 --> 07:41:47,830
your stupid phase one eat my ass i want stamina yeah rolling probably is worse than juking i'll

1785
07:41:47,830 --> 07:41:54,900
stop rolling and this i'm telling you right now like that shit takes you out like that takes too

1786
07:41:54,900 --> 07:43:11,619
long i thought that was the moon holy fucking shit okay you can't but what the fuck am i locking on

1787
07:43:11,619 --> 07:44:09,560
to dude dogs are getting in the fucking way get out of the fucking way the giant where is she

1788

1789
07:44:38,840 --> 07:45:27,930
i was killed really glad for all this uh soundproofing screaming like no no don't

1790
07:45:27,930 --> 07:45:34,569
oh god i'm coming for you this is bad i can't scream it oh that was horrible

1791
07:45:35,529 --> 07:45:55,799
that wasn't even that bad it was okay all right all right okay 40 000 souls by the way

1792
07:46:04,139 --> 07:46:10,060
cheater and i hate you you're a dumb boss and yeah i'll take that orange and fucking you can

1793
07:46:10,060 --> 07:46:15,740
throw that orange in the ocean that like whatever that is a little like cutie orange like the

1794
07:46:15,740 --> 07:46:28,630
clementines you fucking peel it let me make sure i don't die here so what's the pro what's going

1795
07:46:28,630 --> 07:47:00,419
on now let me do this don't don't don't don't don't i'm coming for you bitch my god if that

1796
07:47:00,419 --> 07:47:07,959
killed me can you fucking imagine if that killed me because it doesn't count it doesn't count if

1797
07:47:07,959 --> 07:47:32,740
you die during a boss fight i would have been so awful but look this is what i'm talking about

1798
07:47:32,740 --> 07:47:47,000
ready like okay so hold on let me put it on screen so look when check this shit out i did

1799
07:47:47,000 --> 07:47:56,490
a full heal right before this because i remember i i rose right after the giant came out and i said

1800
07:47:56,490 --> 07:48:04,220
like oh shit i better be at full health for this oh i kill her so i kill her right i get i have

1801
07:48:04,220 --> 07:48:12,299
almost full health i'm coming for you bitch look at this move that's still there can you imagine

1802
07:48:12,299 --> 07:48:42,139
if i did not have that face that's fucking embarrassing it was embarrassing okay so

1803
07:48:42,139 --> 07:48:52,740
there's a chest right here i already sat at that right where did he flee my sweet things i'm right

1804
07:48:52,740 --> 07:48:56,340
here i'm opening up the treasure chest it's locked

1805
07:49:12,520 --> 07:49:20,360
i just kill her reborn of my beloved egg i just realized that her hat is like a snake or a bird

1806
07:49:20,360 --> 07:49:32,259
or something that has eyes rebirth cosmetics okay so i can redo this rebirth should i do that

1807
07:49:33,619 --> 07:49:38,180
i'm kind of afraid to do that because that's probably just part of the story right

1808
07:49:44,150 --> 07:50:05,560
it's a respec they added respecs to really no way it's a stat refresh has there always been

1809
07:50:05,560 --> 07:50:13,770
a respec i don't remember you lose 10 you're great ruins oh right i would imagine i probably

1810
07:50:13,770 --> 07:50:22,200
got something from her take the power we gotta go okay yeah this is gonna be huge

1811
07:50:23,080 --> 07:50:27,990
all right well i don't want to do that let's level up no i'm not gonna level up yet because

1812
07:50:27,990 --> 07:50:34,060
i want to maybe get one of those uh spells okay let's i can teleport here whenever i want this

1813
07:50:34,060 --> 07:50:46,659
is the uh grand library let's go back here there's a jet it's a lock chest i want to see

1814
07:50:46,659 --> 07:50:56,779
what this is i'm gonna go talk to the finger lady this is the creepiest thing in this whole

1815
07:50:56,779 --> 07:51:25,900
game by the way it's so weird you have earned the right to become elder lord have i now seek

1816
07:51:25,900 --> 07:51:36,139
the earth tree and an audience with queen marika to become elder lord and restore the golden order

1817
07:51:36,139 --> 07:51:41,740
i'm not done streaming yet because i want to i think i want to go to that castle skip foggy door

1818
07:51:49,430 --> 07:51:51,319
more talismans

1819
07:51:51,720 --> 07:52:20,599
become okay what is that 60 intelligence full moon sorcery 70 intelligence guys i don't think

1820
07:52:20,599 --> 07:52:30,779
we're getting there 60 and this is uh this is astrologer yeah uh this is definitely for

1821
07:52:30,779 --> 07:52:38,970
astrology because i don't think it's reliable that i'm going with this character with this kind of

1822
07:52:39,209 --> 07:52:46,740
like battle mage i don't think i get to 60 intelligence i don't want to go full

1823
07:52:46,740 --> 07:52:54,619
sorcery it it sucks with bosses full sorcery is really fun to try to like cheese bosses and stuff

1824
07:52:54,619 --> 07:52:59,689
but it for first playthrough it's like it's hard because you really you have to kind of stand

1825
07:52:59,689 --> 07:53:12,069
really still i don't like sorcery for the first time that's so goddamn cool looking though is

1826
07:53:12,069 --> 07:53:28,020
it a sword it's a staff right it's a scepter just i could just consume the soul too this is really

1827
07:53:28,020 --> 07:53:33,819
awesome but i think for the first playthrough i kind of have to stick with what i'm doing here

1828
07:53:34,619 --> 07:53:40,939
and that's spells light spell casting battle mage with like the decks in scaling weapons

1829
07:53:45,319 --> 07:53:51,639
this looks insane though doing like a full complete just astrology or just dumping every

1830
07:53:51,639 --> 07:53:56,619
single point you get into sorcery or intelligence i think probably you probably want to kill bosses

1831
07:53:56,619 --> 07:54:13,880
with this it looks like a sword but it says the staff down i also want to look at this too where

1832
07:54:13,880 --> 07:54:29,979
is it okay this is godric's great rune did i get a great rune okay great rune of the unborn used to

1833
07:54:29,979 --> 07:54:39,939
perfect rebirth oh so you use it okay so this is the great rune so once i respect this is gone

1834
07:54:39,939 --> 07:54:56,360
this is the great rune okay cool go back to the turtle yeah uh i'm gonna break it i know it's sad

1835
07:54:56,360 --> 07:55:00,200
and that those items look so cool but it's just not gonna work with what i'm working with

1836
07:55:00,919 --> 07:55:16,520
so i'm gonna crush it unfortunate but we're gonna be like at 35 40 and

1837
07:55:17,669 --> 07:55:30,569
30 decks yeah 60 and 70 intelligence means i have to redo the whole character

1838
07:55:31,290 --> 07:55:37,049
which i i mean i this thing is awesome never don't forget don't forget what we have equipped right

1839
07:55:37,049 --> 07:55:47,319
now this thing is awesome it scales off of int decks and strength but we're doing pretty much

1840
07:55:47,720 --> 07:56:05,290
int index bring some water got you covered right here you should just do full sorcery

1841
07:56:06,169 --> 07:56:10,650
i would be pretty bad at full sorcery because folks like i said full sorcery requires you to

1842
07:56:11,209 --> 07:56:17,419
essentially stand still which i don't like doing i'm not confident enough to do it maybe like

1843
07:56:17,419 --> 07:56:21,659
another two or three playthroughs and i'll do like yeah i'll do a full just caster caster no melee

1844
07:56:21,659 --> 07:56:36,939
weapon no swinging at all all right let me go to the turtle and this is this will be it uh wait i

1845
07:56:36,939 --> 07:56:42,950
want to look at that i'm gonna go to the castle skip because i want to see what those uh keys do

1846
07:56:43,750 --> 07:56:59,639
the foggy door all right lindstone comet this is in 36 which will get there will definitely star

1847
07:56:59,639 --> 07:57:05,880
shower sounds cool our six shooting stars that pursue foes so that's like the ring and they

1848
07:57:06,840 --> 07:57:14,500
the thing the dog was doing to us there's also this thing i can afford them all but i don't

1849
07:57:14,500 --> 07:57:22,330
know if i really want to buy them all this is probably the best one to get because this is

1850
07:57:22,330 --> 07:57:32,659
melee i believe this is melee so i'm gonna get it this one is kind of cool too i kind of want

1851
07:57:32,659 --> 07:57:54,659
the comet though let me go check and see how this one looks because if this is the one that i think

1852
07:57:54,659 --> 07:58:00,659
it is i can incorporate this into a rotation you know what i mean i can like slash slash with the

1853
07:58:00,659 --> 07:58:06,819
magic uh weapon which is exactly the kind of character that i'm trying to make you look like

1854
07:58:06,819 --> 07:58:30,299
an scp oh i sound like one too is this what i think it is yeah it is so i could be like wham

1855
07:58:31,099 --> 07:58:44,409
wham it's kind of it's a good potential i wonder if it uh it staggers it is really slow but that is

1856
07:58:44,409 --> 07:58:49,619
precisely thank you for bringing that up there's a really good point that's why we're putting

1857
07:58:49,619 --> 07:58:57,529
points into dexterity so if i want dexterity up too because if you don't know let's explanation

1858
07:58:57,529 --> 07:59:05,770
dexterity reduces casting time of spells so eventually this thing could actually be faster

1859
07:59:05,770 --> 07:59:15,689
way faster let's see how much damage it does how was the scale i wonder does it have a three

1860
07:59:15,689 --> 07:59:25,240
swing or is it just two it can just be chained it's got a massive arc too look at that arc

1861
07:59:26,900 --> 07:59:31,299
that's pretty useful now we're going to do decks we have to make sure we can get some decks

1862
07:59:31,299 --> 07:59:44,979
so i don't think i'm going to buy the other shit i'm going to level up 25 25 and then we'll do

1863
07:59:44,979 --> 08:00:03,720
endurance mind maybe i could get this over with but that's i'm just so that's so many points to

1864
08:00:03,720 --> 08:00:25,779
not put into something else i want 25 25 i think it's actually really really important see how fast

1865
08:00:25,779 --> 08:00:46,279
this is now that is way faster that is uh at least 10 to 15 faster than it was before no it

1866
08:00:46,279 --> 08:00:56,389
absolutely it definitely is what about oleg well now i can focus on oleg but i can't just let my

1867
08:00:56,389 --> 08:01:02,520
damage fall off completely i have to like be able to beat stuff in the game too there's no difference

1868
08:01:02,520 --> 08:01:12,069
where there has to be i don't know if this is realistic i think it's all right look i have a

1869
08:01:12,069 --> 08:01:19,610
respect if this doesn't work out let me buy this other one too this is like the little one swift

1870
08:01:20,330 --> 08:01:37,909
this actually could be useful too copium this could be what what it ends up being right because

1871
08:01:37,909 --> 08:01:57,610
i have the pole oh just a lot faster so it could be like when wham dodge wham lightning bolt

1872
08:01:57,610 --> 08:02:20,500
lightning bolt yeah i need mana flasks really cool though really cool let's see how much

1873
08:02:20,500 --> 08:02:26,360
damage this stuff does because i this little swift one this could be a little just pick people off

1874
08:02:26,360 --> 08:02:37,000
and like kind of poke at people let's check the one that i really care about this one here i mean

1875
08:02:37,000 --> 08:02:56,020
that's a lot considering my regular swing is it's got huge range too that one i don't really like

1876
08:02:56,020 --> 08:03:09,080
so much but i think this is a bad indicator because these guys work so hard there's nothing

1877
08:03:09,080 --> 08:03:16,939
in there all right well i'm just done all right well i'm just playing around um i kind of want

1878
08:03:16,939 --> 08:03:33,459
to kill that guy he's that's just like a regular enemy it's kind of bad i don't know if that's

1879
08:03:33,459 --> 08:03:40,020
going to be amazing if there's more than one person right can i hold the button down let's see you

1880
08:03:40,020 --> 08:03:54,939
cannot hold the button down oh they're not here anymore they come out at night i get it all right

1881
08:03:54,939 --> 08:04:12,970
let's fight a group with it all right it's showing its usefulness because that can really make or

1882
08:04:12,970 --> 08:04:18,409
break anything this one's not bad but it's kind of the other one hits a little harder

1883
08:04:19,369 --> 08:04:32,169
it's really good against groups and some of the toughest shit in this game is when three or four

1884
08:04:32,169 --> 08:04:50,819
people are all in front of you i'll leave it on for now so here's an interesting question does

1885
08:04:50,819 --> 08:04:59,799
this scale do my sorcery moves scale with the staff or are they just based off of intelligence

1886
08:04:59,799 --> 08:05:21,750
and that's it i wonder both so i really should be upgrading the step too if i can this is good for

1887
08:05:21,750 --> 08:05:32,500
stutter i'll try it for now all right we're not done almost done i need to go back here and i

1888
08:05:32,500 --> 08:05:44,310
believe it's it's like right here somewhere right here i want to do that castle skip drop down

1889
08:05:45,610 --> 08:06:01,189
and then there it is the misty door for the keys is it this way not this one

1890
08:06:01,189 --> 08:06:11,189
bro please i'm begging you craft man two main bosses down i believe it's three main bosses down

1891
08:06:11,189 --> 08:06:17,189
as of right this moment unless that wasn't a main boss i think it was though because that was the

1892
08:06:17,189 --> 08:06:30,310
academy lady bro please oh it's one of these right main gate left side i think it's main gate

1893
08:06:40,819 --> 08:06:49,689
i just don't remember no it's up there i wrote after castle skip foggy door needs a key

1894
08:06:50,810 --> 08:06:54,250
and i but i don't i should have told myself where the castle skip was

1895
08:06:58,229 --> 08:07:01,750
and i played too many from software games i think you have to travel from the bonfire

1896
08:07:03,619 --> 08:07:29,560
rampart tower does anybody remember this is what i wrote down tower i this is it yep okay

1897
08:07:30,360 --> 08:08:06,860
so we go here i think it's potentially a mcdonald's night time is it oh shit

1898
08:08:15,259 --> 08:08:50,950
it's late my god it's late it's too late shit it's late i did it now it's down here right right here

1899
08:08:54,810 --> 08:09:31,180
i don't i wonder what's in here let's check it out here we go okay what is this

1900
08:09:31,180 --> 08:09:51,220
is iron wet blade and ockcrest wooden shield miss misery miss record me sorry miss record

1901
08:10:01,619 --> 08:10:22,580
oh it's a dagger art and sharpening critical hits especially potent that's cool looking that's

1902
08:10:22,580 --> 08:10:34,700
cool that's insane crit yeah that's cool i got one of those whetstone things too

1903
08:10:34,700 --> 08:10:37,740
not entirely certain of what they are

1904
08:10:44,340 --> 08:10:50,970
ranch wish me a happy birthday my mom forgot about it and i thought you could fill in for her

1905
08:10:52,419 --> 08:10:54,419
happy birthday yes that doesn't sound good

1906
08:11:01,819 --> 08:11:14,470
i remember looking in here from there okay well cool that's what that do i have any more keys

1907
08:11:14,470 --> 08:11:29,669
i think i think it's two to get in there yeah that was one okay um iron grants choice of trinity

1908
08:11:32,060 --> 08:11:44,090
every keen or quality can be chosen so this you can put this on a weapon right and it'll scale it

1909
08:11:44,090 --> 08:11:54,599
for intelligence imagining right or vice versa you can change the scaling of the weapon okay

1910
08:11:55,159 --> 08:12:06,259
i think that's it 12 30 it's late been about eight hours i want to keep playing all right i have a

1911
08:12:06,259 --> 08:12:15,700
proposition for you i have a proposition for everybody here here's my proposition two options

1912
08:12:16,939 --> 08:12:25,130
option one is just keep going i'm gonna eat like i'll just go figure out what i'm gonna eat

1913
08:12:26,790 --> 08:12:30,869
no this is a bad idea because then it'll get too late and i'll fuck up my whole sleep schedule

1914
08:12:30,869 --> 08:12:45,450
no that's it we're done i want to play okay uh that's it that was awesome it was an intense

1915
08:12:45,450 --> 08:12:53,020
session uh we'll be live tomorrow tomorrow starting at the same time about four o'clock

1916
08:12:53,020 --> 08:13:02,520
pacific i cannot guarantee we're gonna do five days in a row but you know i want to play elden

1917
08:13:02,520 --> 08:13:09,669
ring i just want to play it so if i'm not gonna here's the thing i'm not gonna play this game

1918
08:13:09,669 --> 08:13:16,360
off stream realistically until i get to a point where i've seen a lot of the game already

1919
08:13:17,240 --> 08:13:26,700
so i'm just playing it as i stream it which makes sense right so i'll be left tomorrow four o'clock

1920
08:13:29,000 --> 08:13:40,259
aim rating update it's still a 9.4 it has not changed although it actually it went down to

1921
08:13:40,259 --> 08:13:53,139
like a 9.3 and then ticked back up to a 9.4 so it hasn't it hasn't gone anywhere look at how much

1922
08:13:53,139 --> 08:14:13,540
of this shit is this is ridiculous how long have i been playing this total hours 20 30 25 it was

1923
08:14:13,540 --> 08:14:19,939
like 10 hours the first day eight nine hours the second day you know it's been like 27 28

1924
08:14:22,580 --> 08:14:30,709
when i was my first playthrough of bloodborne and dark souls 3 i don't think was more than

1925
08:14:31,509 --> 08:14:46,119
35 to 40 i i beat dark souls 3 in like what four five streams five streams maybe four like five

1926
08:14:46,119 --> 08:14:54,250
yeah i'm not even remotely close to be even touching the surface of this game it was eight

1927
08:14:54,330 --> 08:15:03,319
streams with the plus the dlc okay so what like five or six without it i feel like after 30 hours

1928
08:15:03,319 --> 08:15:14,259
in dark souls 3 you're getting close to like the last arc of the game it's insane all right this

1929
08:15:14,259 --> 08:15:22,259
is uh yeah i will catch you guys tomorrow at four let's get the credits we'll just chill for a

1930
08:15:22,259 --> 08:15:30,630
little bit thanks for watching as always i know that i can be a little much sometimes my um rage

1931
08:15:32,099 --> 08:15:47,509
but no i think the game is fantastic it's just it's it's crazy and i will see you later i gotta

1932
08:15:47,509 --> 08:15:56,490
figure out what i'm gonna do for food though which i'm not sure because it's very very late

1933
08:15:57,049 --> 08:16:32,220
we'll figure something out uh let's see i'm hungry but what what's even available i wonder

1934
08:16:33,139 --> 08:16:46,840
figure it out uh we're gonna raid box box i don't know where box box is in the game they're also

1935
08:16:46,840 --> 08:16:53,619
playing elden ring let's see where he is yeah do you guys do the same thing where it's a get you

1936
08:16:53,619 --> 08:16:57,860
want to see where people are so you almost like open one eye and like you look down at the health

1937
08:16:57,860 --> 08:17:01,060
bar and you kind of just see what the area looks like and you click click on for two seconds look

1938
08:17:01,060 --> 08:17:13,990
away i don't know where box box is in the game but it could be way further ahead than i am or

1939
08:17:13,990 --> 08:17:28,580
it could be way before where i am right now so just be aware there may be spoilers ahead

1940
08:17:28,580 --> 08:18:35,529
be aware good night goodbye go say hi to box box see you soon
