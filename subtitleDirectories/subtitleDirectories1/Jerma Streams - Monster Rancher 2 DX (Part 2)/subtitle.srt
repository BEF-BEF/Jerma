1
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,740
Late, but early. Late, but early. Late, but early. That's what I like to say.

2
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:18,760
Hi, how are you? Supposed to start in like a couple hours, but I changed the plan a little bit.

3
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:30,460
I moved the stream back to 2 30-ish because I want to play more Monster Rancher.

4
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,380
And I'm here. And I don't want to wait till 4 30 to turn my stream on.

5
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:43,159
Because at 4 30 is the game awards. That's going to be a few hours, or at least a couple hours.

6
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:52,840
I want to be able to, I want to play. Also, very, very, very tragic news

7
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,840
that I need to report to everybody watching the stream right now. Unfortunately,

8
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:04,950
because I am not kidding. I was searching. Searching every corner of every room here

9
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:22,599
to try to find Precious Family Heirloom that I don't have anymore. It's just not the same without it.

10
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:43,189
I lost the bathrobe. Bathrobe, the precious plaid bathrobe is no longer here. It's because

11
00:01:45,670 --> 00:02:01,620
I promised that I wouldn't fucking cry when I turn the stream on, but I left it at the dollhouse.

12
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:11,830
It was an accessory on dollhouse and I left it there and it's gone. So I'm sorry that I know

13
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:19,590
everyone's expecting me to be in that outfit. Trust me, I want to be, but I can't. At least

14
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:26,310
it got a good send off. It was on the dollhouse stream for an hour. I think I'll just get another

15
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,569
one. I know it's not going to be the same. It's not going to be the same. I know it's not going

16
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:34,090
to smell the same. It's not going to be the same. It's not going to be the same wear and tear. I

17
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:46,259
didn't wash it once. So it's not going to smell like rotten eggs like it did, which fuck. No robe,

18
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:56,939
no stream. That's not how this works. Let us peep. No, we're not peeping any horror right now.

19
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:02,979
Buy it. But we got a lot to do today. I really want to play Monster Rancher again. I want to try

20
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:10,919
to get to A rank if I can. Probably, maybe, hopefully before the game awards. I'll be streaming

21
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:18,599
the game awards when it goes live. What do you say? I look like a what? You're looking very

22
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:30,330
Fallout NPC today. Did your TikTok go viral yet? Doesn't seem like it. Not yet. Sometimes these

23
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:42,039
things take a while. Horror now. No, I don't, I don't want to, I want people to be alive.

24
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:56,389
Your skin's still red though. You're the orangutan. No, I, I can't replicate greatness. You can. You

25
00:03:56,389 --> 00:04:08,199
can try. I'll always be the original. Oh, like hashtag orangutan dance. Hashtag replica. Hashtag

26
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:19,879
replicating Jeremy. Hashtag replica of Jeremy. I'll always be the original. Freshly shaved.

27
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:30,810
Actually, no, I shaved yesterday. Ecomaniac. Got my water. Are you guys ready? I'm not even going

28
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:34,889
to be, you know what? You're not getting face cam until at least 10 minutes before the game awards.

29
00:04:34,889 --> 00:05:00,250
May have another few minutes. Are you even real? I don't. What? No, no, this whole thing can't be

30
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:22,839
a dream. It's, this is so cool. This is going so well. No, no, no, no. The whole thing can't

31
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:30,120
wake up. Hey, crushed lizard. Thanks for the 20 community zaps. No, thanks though. Seriously.

32
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,310
All right. Let's play. I want to play. I don't want to stall. Okay. Yes, we'll watch the game

33
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:42,019
awards. I'll make, I'll change categories. Don't worry. I've got too many things in the way.

34
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:52,839
I need a monitor that's up here. Like up here. There. I got to get some new monitors because

35
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:58,459
right now I have the monitor that's down here on a stand and then I have another monitor here

36
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:03,259
and you, Chad is right here. Like directly kind of like in this zone that I'm looking at right

37
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:10,980
here. Right. I have the OBS stuff over here. I kind of feel like maybe I should have chat here

38
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:20,009
like right in front of me above. Right. So I can kind of just go like that because for right now,

39
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:25,300
I get so distracted and I always have to look at chat and stuff. So going like this, it seems

40
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:34,730
like way easier than going like this. I mean, I like having it near the camera because I feel like

41
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:42,730
you're looking at us. People don't like that. Every time I do direct eye contact, people go,

42
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:54,180
stop doing that. I hate that. Let's get this on. Look at us. All right. It's turning the webcam off.

43
00:06:54,180 --> 00:07:05,910
Whatever. It's time to play monster ranch or two. We left off. I'm, I'm coming back. Just give me,

44
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:13,750
I want to be, I want to be private for a minute. I like being private for a minute. You need to

45
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:20,060
come back and look at us. I will. I need to be private for a minute. This is exactly where we

46
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:27,959
were last time. Oh, by the way, if you missed yesterday's stream, I'm currently raising

47
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:33,319
apparently the worst monster in the entire game. I did not know that until I was too far ahead.

48
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:43,269
You need to keep the webcam. Otherwise your account will go down. If only German from

49
00:07:43,269 --> 00:08:01,959
10 years ago knew that when it kept the damn thing on. Okay. So I also have figured out,

50
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:07,259
I researched a few things and I figured a few things out. Oh, by the way, I want to ask this.

51
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:13,579
Do you guys like the black bars or do you want the whole image with the little input presses?

52
00:08:13,579 --> 00:08:22,600
Is this better for you guys? Do you like this more? I think we have to do a poll because I

53
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:29,420
feel like it's pretty split. We've got the black bars or kind of all the other random

54
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:37,899
shit on the screen. Let's run a poll. All the shit on the screen are black bars. Whole milk.

55
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:48,779
You're gross. I can't think of the last time I heard of somebody drinking whole milk. Well,

56
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:52,860
you're not, you're not gross. You're not, that was mean. I don't mean that. I mean that like,

57
00:08:53,259 --> 00:09:01,460
I think that I would be gross if that were me doing it. I don't like whole milk. I think it's

58
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:10,919
like, it's like I'm drinking cream. I don't even like regular milk. 2% milk is like what I would

59
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:19,429
be okay with. I know that's skim milk shit, right? Like, okay. Skim milk. No, no, no. Whole milk.

60
00:09:19,429 --> 00:09:27,049
No, no, no. 2% milk. That's such a happy Thanos balance medium. 2% is disgusting. Okay. And what

61
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:34,139
do you drink? Skim? Hey, I got, I got a bunch of bugs that are floating on the top of my pool.

62
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:46,149
You want to skim those out too? 2% is based. All right. What do we got? People want the

63
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:56,950
bars or not? I think I'm too big though. I think it's so the face game is aligned with the bars.

64
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:12,809
Kind of too small. Should I move the game over? Let's be a streamer here, right? Does that suck?

65
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:20,659
I feel like that's, I hate that. I don't like it. The unevenness makes me want to throw up.

66
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:29,509
Yeah, I don't like it. Go back. I thought I just like control Z to a point where I like the stream

67
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:34,220
is going to turn off. Cause that was like the first input, right? Can you do that? If I hit

68
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:41,769
control Z like five times, it will turn the stream off. All right, let's go. You want,

69
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:46,379
fine. I'll leave it on. Whatever. I put a fucking t-shirt on. Just don't make fun of me when like

70
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:53,419
boogers come out of my nose. All right. So last thing that we did, what was the last thing? I

71
00:10:53,419 --> 00:11:01,480
don't know. Oh yeah. I did some research and I found out that I'm doing this shit completely

72
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:09,259
wrong. The, the, I looked up some, some, some tips and some strategies and the training regimen,

73
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:15,289
when they get to be a adult, you don't even really want them to rest unless you do a battle or

74
00:11:15,289 --> 00:11:21,370
unless you do an air entry. So when I'm just doing training, I shouldn't be just resting two

75
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:28,490
or three times, like twice a month. I should be hard training, nut oil, light training,

76
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:34,980
mint, hard training, nut oil. I got to go back and forth. So I think I'm going to try that out

77
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,700
and see how that goes. It's meta gaming. I know, but I, this is the worst monster in the game.

78
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,889
I have to at least try to metagame this guy and no, maybe you should choose another monster.

79
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:57,240
It's too late. I'm getting 400 intelligence. So where, what am I doing? What's the next battle?

80
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:03,559
I want to try to at least get to like B today. Fuck the game awards. I'm going to put the game

81
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:10,570
awards in a cube this big up in the corner. Who cares? What do I care? I don't have my robe. I

82
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:14,330
can't even stream it properly. So I'm annoyed by that. So it's going to be a cube in the corner.

83
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:24,299
All right. So I can train. Let's do it. What, let's see how old, how old are you? All right.

84
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:27,899
Seven months. I think we're at that point now where I can start to do the, the heavy training

85
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:38,840
regimen. Let's go for it. Let's do, I need to go to, okay. Training, grill. We're going to do

86
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:51,980
hard intelligence training. I'm going to do meditate. I need to get to 400 speed and

87
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:59,240
intelligence. Go for it. Your monster sucks. Hold that thought for another few minutes.

88
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:18,309
Go for it. Meditate. Why'd he leave? He just fucking left. Don't do that. You're pretty tired.

89
00:13:18,309 --> 00:13:21,590
Okay, fine. We're going to start the new training regimen at the beginning of next week,

90
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:30,710
next month. Rest, rest, rest up. This wall sucks. I'm getting this to 400 intelligence

91
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:34,330
and I'm going to get the, I'm going to send him on an errand tree. He's going to get the

92
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:39,509
intelligence move and we're going to laser light show every motherfucker that we find

93
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:46,460
that we see in the video game. You understand? I'm sad about the robe. I am unironically sad

94
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:59,240
about that too. Okay. So I'm going to just get him ready. So let's see, which one's the next battle?

95
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:05,620
All right. I'm going to skip this and we're going, we're just doing heavy training for two months.

96
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:13,450
You ready? What do I have? I need to buy items. How many do I have? Okay. I need more than this.

97
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:31,259
I need a bunch of mint leaves and a bunch of the nut oil. These are so expensive. Okay. Mint leaves.

98
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:41,740
I need at least like four. That's a lot. Three. And then I need three of these. All right. This

99
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:45,740
is better work. Otherwise I'd literally soft locked myself and I can't continue playing.

100
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:52,009
What happened to bug Batman? Bug Batman is currently frozen because he is about probably

101
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:56,679
like two or three months, maybe three or four months away from dying. I'm keeping him frozen

102
00:14:56,679 --> 00:15:04,360
so I can combine them later. All right. Here we go. I'm ready. Rest up. You get double rest this

103
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:13,269
time. And then when you get up tomorrow, you better be ready. Rest two rests in a row. Let's go. And

104
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:38,460
we're going to feed. Oh, jelly boiled. Not going to be spoiled anymore. I don't need to worry about

105
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:46,679
that. Okay. You're actually running out of money. Don't worry. I'll be fine. Here we go. It's time

106
00:15:46,759 --> 00:16:05,509
training. Real heavy intelligence training. Heavy intelligence. Begin. Please do it.

107
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:30,250
How does this make you smarter? Now we do a mint leaf light training. We don't rest. This is the

108
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:52,940
non rest strat. We go out. We do light training. So light intelligence. Go for it. Mint light,

109
00:16:52,940 --> 00:17:07,430
nut heavy. Yes. That's precisely what we're trying to do. Now we take a nut. Use. Bingo. Heavy

110
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:40,099
training. I got to get them to at least 330 intelligence. Heavy school mattress. Nice. Good

111
00:17:40,099 --> 00:17:46,779
increases. Okay. I got to do defense though. Okay. Three. It's a combined it's combined speed and

112
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:55,079
intelligence, right? It's a dorm room bed. I swear to God. Dorm room mattresses. Let me tell you

113
00:17:55,079 --> 00:18:02,869
something. Okay. Or as expensive as room and board is at college. This is a shot at every fucking one

114
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:10,440
of these colleges, right? Listen to this. Room and board is so expensive. It's remarkable to me

115
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,900
that they have these like fucking twin air mattresses that are in all these places.

116
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:22,619
If you're going to have college be that expensive, you put, you put, you put Tempur-Pedics in those

117
00:18:22,619 --> 00:18:32,309
fucking dorm rooms. You put, you put like Tempur-Pedic branded mattresses in there. I swear to God,

118
00:18:32,869 --> 00:18:41,029
when I was in college, the bed that I was laying on was actually filled with air. It was like,

119
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:48,789
you know what? It was, it reminded me of a pool toy. It was a pool toy. I actually think a pool

120
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:53,609
toy may have been more comfortable. It was a pool toy with a sheet on. College is going to be that

121
00:18:53,609 --> 00:19:04,839
expensive. There should be a flat screen TV at every one of these fucking dorm rooms. Complaining

122
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:18,259
because of your GPA. I had a 2.6 GPA. It was good enough. Okay. Now, wait, I just messed it up. It

123
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:30,660
was heavy training, mint, light training, nut oil, heavy training, mint, light training. I forget.

124
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:39,589
2.6. What's wrong with that? That's literally like, who cares? It doesn't say what my GPA

125
00:19:39,589 --> 00:19:55,480
is on my degree. But Jerma, you didn't make the Dean's lift. The Dean didn't say my name.

126
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:06,119
I have this, no way I'm going to forget this. To have five, 10 years from now and not give a shit

127
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:18,660
about, I don't even know the Dean's name. Coping, cope, copium. Do your best. Listen to me. This is

128
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,339
important. All of you listen. I'm a lot older than a lot of you guys here. I have a lot more wisdom

129
00:20:22,339 --> 00:20:28,630
and knowledge than you'll ever have until you get to my age. Listen to me. Do your best, but you

130
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:35,880
don't have to be perfect. Just try to do as good as you can. If you get straight F's, you got some

131
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:41,319
stuff to work on. D's, you got some stuff to work on. Don't worry about it. You're going to be

132
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:48,779
all right. C's, B's, B minus, that's good. You did good enough. I don't like the grading system.

133
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:58,309
I think we need to go back. Listen to me. We need to go back to kindergarten grading. It was like S,

134
00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:06,150
which was like you passed. Like S, P, and like F, right? We need to go back to like first grade

135
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:16,180
grading. Did you, like you passed or you did like sufficient, right? What was it? What are they?

136
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:28,630
There really should only be three grades. S means like really good. P means you passed, but like

137
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:34,819
you might need a little bit of work. And then like, oh, you failed the class. Satisfactory. Yeah.

138
00:21:34,819 --> 00:21:39,619
Why do we care? Why does that, oh, well, uh, we have it at a hundred point scale. Why, what's the

139
00:21:39,619 --> 00:21:47,609
point of a hundred point scale if anything under 50 means you fucking lose? That's stupid. What's

140
00:21:47,609 --> 00:21:55,910
the point of a hundred point scale? You're smurfing. Guys, I don't get a hundred point scale.

141
00:21:55,910 --> 00:22:07,529
It's just like why anything under like 60 means you're lost. Under 70 technically. Get a

142
00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:18,900
goddamn flat screen TV in those dorm rooms. Plasma. LED. Backlit. You're based. I don't think this is

143
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:24,309
just regular shit. I don't know why this is based. It should be like normal stuff. I'm saying like

144
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:31,579
normal, popular opinion things, I hope. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

145
00:22:31,579 --> 00:22:41,859
What was it? Oh, popular opinion, Andy. That's me. You're a mad lad. What a popular opinion, Andy.

146
00:22:45,259 --> 00:22:49,180
I just, a hundred point scale. I used to get so mad when it was like, oh, I got like a C minus.

147
00:22:51,500 --> 00:23:02,650
That means you're stupid. What? No, who cares? What are you talking about? And by the way,

148
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:10,710
let me, let me tell you another thing. Retention is more important than memorization. And I think

149
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:16,309
that our current education system is based on memorizing things from a book, not retaining

150
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:21,160
things. I don't remember anything that I did in high school, especially like some of the random

151
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:26,440
shit that I had to memorize temporarily. Cause that's what you want to do. You want to temporarily

152
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:33,579
memorize something so you get a good enough grade. But in the long-term, you don't really actually

153
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:40,460
care to retain that information. You guys, you'll see, look, even, even some basic stuff that I

154
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,309
should probably know, right? If you ask me like basic science questions, I probably would be like,

155
00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:50,519
I don't have any idea what you're talking about. Retention is more important than memorization.

156
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:59,240
So 2.6 GPA actually means 150 IQ. That was my long winded way for me to say that I'm not stupid.

157
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:08,980
I promise I had a 2.6 GPA. All right. Now we're going to take, so training. All right.

158
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:15,740
People help me out here. I think I screwed up. The last thing I did was heavy training.

159
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:38,519
So it's mint leaf, right? And then we do light, not oil, right? This is a Fortnite ball. Okay.

160
00:24:39,609 --> 00:24:49,029
Training, light, intelligence. I'm just trying to stack intelligence, man. I swear to God.

161
00:24:49,029 --> 00:25:10,119
Are you high? No, but I will be in an hour. 10 for light training. All right. I actually am

162
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:16,630
going to run out of money. Uh, I think I got to unfreeze the, I got to unfreeze that guy,

163
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:23,609
bring him out of retirement, have him win one tournament and then put him back in the freezer.

164
00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:47,109
Okay. Now it's oil, heavy oil, then heavy mint, then light. I'm just going to work them. No rest.

165
00:25:47,109 --> 00:26:01,700
Not unless we do an hour entry intelligence. Let's go. What the fuck is this thing?

166
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:13,559
Imagine if I said that about you, if you said that about me as my buddy, Dave, uh,

167
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:22,329
this, uh, just nice to meet him. What the fuck is that thing? That's not rude to you at all.

168
00:26:22,329 --> 00:26:45,690
You know, you know, he has a name. Cosmic calamity. So now that's mint, light training, oil,

169
00:26:45,690 --> 00:27:03,049
heavy training, and then we have to relax. I am determined. Actually he's doing pretty well.

170
00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:11,829
Oh, it's okay. It's all right. It's all right. I am being a little too soft though.

171
00:27:11,829 --> 00:27:19,079
All right. I need some, uh, monster rancher two lore masters. Even if they fail,

172
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:26,710
I still have to stick to the regimen, right? So that's, it doesn't matter. Like it's not like

173
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:35,769
they failed and they didn't, it still counts like to their stress and fatigue. Here's a 2.6 GPA.

174
00:27:35,769 --> 00:27:44,140
The views on education really reflect his face and faith in minerals and rocks. Your views on

175
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:55,480
education really reflect your views on minerals and rocks, like black tourmaline. What's with the

176
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:00,119
black tourmaline thing coming back? I haven't worn that bracelet in probably a year and a half.

177
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:09,589
Why are people talking about it now? It was a mistake I made and I'm burying it. I actually

178
00:28:09,589 --> 00:28:13,589
like that. I like that bracelet. I don't think it has superpowers. I think it's just cool. I like

179
00:28:13,589 --> 00:28:31,700
it. I'd like stones and crystals. Uh, do you see that? And what, you don't think that I like

180
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:37,940
crystals and stones and should have a gigantic stone crystal right behind me. You were there

181
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:43,849
for that. You are on that stream. You are, you participated. I like, I don't know. I think they're

182
00:28:43,849 --> 00:29:00,569
cool. Educational. Nice. Interesting. Loves getting stoned. Not yet. I'm just kidding. Just relax.

183
00:29:00,569 --> 00:29:06,460
All right. Uh, I forgot the last thing I did. I just have to, just, that's why the face cam can't

184
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:13,769
be on. I'm so aware of my face. Um, what's the last thing I just did? Light training and he failed

185
00:29:13,769 --> 00:29:23,859
it. Okay. So we still have to do the oil. Heavy training. After this, we're going to do a battle

186
00:29:23,859 --> 00:29:30,220
because I am going to run out of money. You have Funko's on that shelf and they're worth about 14

187
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:48,599
to 15,000 dollars. Yen. Not USD. Uh, all right. Training. Real. This might actually put us over

188
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:57,299
the edge here. And then I want to send them on an air entry. I want nuts oil. I just gave it to you.

189
00:29:57,299 --> 00:30:04,779
What? You just had one. You just ate one. You can't have two. You can't act like you can't be the dog

190
00:30:04,779 --> 00:30:10,619
that gets the cookie. Right. Oh, I want a cookie. Right. Here's your little, here's the dog cookie.

191
00:30:10,619 --> 00:30:24,569
And then just still waiting for another one. It's like you just had one. No, he wants more oil. He

192
00:30:24,569 --> 00:30:37,190
wants to get high. You guys need to relax. All right. Officially over 400 combined speed and

193
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:48,170
intelligence. Now I can get that intelligence move. Is that a CBD shake? No, I don't. Well,

194
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:53,220
I have enough money to do this one more week, one more month before unfreezing and winning a

195
00:30:53,220 --> 00:31:00,599
tournament because he's right now in the prime of his life. I have to be very careful. I don't

196
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:04,440
have, no, I can't, I don't have any items left. I have enough to do this one more cycle, I think.

197
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:14,650
Right. I have to enter this tournament. I can do this one more cycle. That was heavy. So now we do

198
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:35,619
a stress relief herb spices. I'm going to do heavy drill one more time and then we'll rest them.

199
00:31:35,619 --> 00:31:53,369
Light drill tournament. Don't need the full 400 intelligence speed to get the ability. 400 is

200
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:57,690
just the point where it's a hundred percent chance to get the ability from the pop us air entry.

201
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:04,740
All right. So I just have to do the pop us air entry. That got 350 fucking XP. I'm good to go.

202
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:11,220
This is going to be huge. All the doubters here are going to get floored when I get to a rank.

203
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:24,309
Cup of jelly, do a tournament. I have to, I have to freeze them and then unfreeze. Um, I have to,

204
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:29,589
you're, you're a rank number one. Shit. It's going to be air entry, isn't it?

205
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:38,859
Thousand bucks for entry. Okay. All right. All right. All right. We got to put this guy on ice

206
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:50,259
and I, when's the next tournament? I just need money from, uh, from the old guy. All right.

207
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:56,440
There's a tournament right now today. That's three grand and it's C rank. I think I'm going

208
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:01,220
to just do the, should I, I don't know if he can handle it. Do you think he can handle it?

209
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:12,339
Unfreeze the retired guy. Do C. What if he loses? I need this money. Otherwise the game softlocks

210
00:33:12,339 --> 00:33:28,599
and it's over. Oh, I'll wait till tomorrow. I'm going to put this guy on ice. Batman can do C.

211
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:39,880
I know, but it's not guaranteed. I might get one hit killed by something. This game actually

212
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:44,359
softlocks if you run out of money. Yep. You run out of money. You basically can't play the game

213
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:51,769
anymore. I'm an hour and 40 minutes into the last stream. What happened to Bonnie? Is he okay?

214
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:19,639
Um, just, uh, I would, I would watch. It's pretty sad. All right. Revive Batman. Let's go.

215
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:29,219
D rank. You can do jobs in town. I heard the jobs are really not efficient and they're really bad

216
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:35,400
to do. Let me see what it is. Do the job. Do you know what kind of work we do? No. I want you to

217
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:40,840
help sort out the materials for the industrial products. There is a set of two pieces of material

218
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:46,019
and each piece has its own number. First, the sum of the two numbers equals 10. Put them into

219
00:34:46,019 --> 00:34:52,409
the above container. Second, if the two are equal, put them into the container below.

220
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:58,099
If not, so pick the higher numbered item. The amount of wages will be determined on how many

221
00:34:58,099 --> 00:35:18,010
materials you sort out. 2.6 GPA. I'm not, I'm not doing battle $3,000. Only four entries. All right,

222
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:26,969
go for it. Let's do it. I don't care about how famous he is. He's supposed to die. That sounds

223
00:35:26,969 --> 00:35:49,610
bad, but it's true. There's only four competitors. Bugbat, Sussbane. Uh oh. It's a mirror with a

224
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:58,920
different subtype. I actually can't fuck this up. So I have a higher power. It's just going to come

225
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:06,900
down to a hit percentage. If I can land hit attacks, get in there and start smashing. Bad,

226
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:15,739
bad start. Really bad start. Abysmal start. That's actually probably the worst start ever.

227
00:36:16,539 --> 00:36:25,750
Do the same thing, please. Okay, come on. Again, again, again, again. I got plenty of guts. Go.

228
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:30,869
Again, again, again, again, again. Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick. 86% chance you had a chance

229
00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:45,530
right there. Oh, who cares? What are you? What is this? Gotta win. Why are you into so many

230
00:36:45,530 --> 00:37:04,070
weird creatures? Train a human. Just hair a little bit. Oh shit, we gotta go against this little,

231
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:10,980
the little owl guy. We actually have to go against the League of Legends character,

232
00:37:12,309 --> 00:37:24,760
which is bad because he's really good. The speed is so awful, but I had to hit him a few times.

233
00:37:27,699 --> 00:37:41,670
Get away from the... Get in. I'm holding. Double tap quick. Again, just do it. I have to just,

234
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:51,449
I have to bully. No, this is gonna kill me in one hit if I don't dodge.

235
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:56,019
Fuck you. What, why is this guy, what's this guy doing in C rank? What are you doing down in C

236
00:37:56,019 --> 00:38:02,099
rank? You do 160 damage a hit. Why are you down here? Fuck this goddamn League character.

237
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:16,019
I, as long as I come in second place, I'll get a prize pool. I remember this guy. All right,

238
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:19,940
just give me the prize pool. Just give me second place. I'll get probably a thousand bucks or so,

239
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:27,829
and then that's all I need. I remember this character, this dude was just hard to hit,

240
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:41,510
but was, couldn't hurt anything. So let's just get in there. Same deal. Not yet. Don't waste guts.

241
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:57,130
Just stay in tight. Go for it now. All right. No, I'm gonna, I'm gonna hold it. Hold it, hold it,

242
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:03,610
hold it. Oh fuck. It's actually not that much damage. It's fine. All right, now I got way more

243
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:18,630
guts than him. Go for it. That should be enough. Stay in tight. Just holding right. I'll get the

244
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:53,420
prize money now. Thank God. AO would be great. No softlock. An adult sippy cup? This is a cup with

245
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:59,179
Sussbane actually beat him. I have a chance. All right. This just got, okay. I might get four grand.

246
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:06,599
Okay. I just have to get lucky. That's all it is. It's just flip a coin if I can hit him or not.

247
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:17,739
Rematch. Let's go. His intelligence move is the worst. He, I gotta just stay close. Don't let him

248
00:40:17,739 --> 00:40:31,880
do this shit. Stay in there. Get in there. Please. Don't let him push me away. He wants to do this

249
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:53,590
fucking move so bad. Oh, I almost killed him in one hit. Nice. Oh, thank God. All right. There it is.

250
00:40:53,590 --> 00:41:03,579
More than $4,000. I'm back in it. Now we go back to, uh, Flammity. Do the Arran tree because it's

251
00:41:03,579 --> 00:41:23,670
on sale. Get the intelligence move and laser beam people and get to A rank. Good work. Arran tree?

252
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:40,360
Yes. 3,300 bucks. And I got a star prune. Oh, that gives you fame, right? I'm going to feed that to

253
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:58,619
the wall. Shit. I'll put you on ice. You did a great job. Thanks for the money. Back to the freezer.

254
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:30,019
Dun dun. Bullying lower ranks. I need money. I'm going to buy, I got to keep the training regimen

255
00:42:30,019 --> 00:42:37,219
up after this too, by the way. All right. Back to the ranch. Arran tree time. Hoppus Arran tree.

256
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:42,309
When the game says you must be registered trainer to generate monster, it just means you haven't

257
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:52,570
unlocked that breed and each breed has a different unlock requirement. Oh, okay. Good enough. So I

258
00:42:52,650 --> 00:43:02,900
need to do Arran tree. I'm going to do run out of rest. Arran tree. Yeah. Rest Arran tree.

259
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:25,139
I want you to be perfectly ready. That's your problem. Give me that intelligence one. You

260
00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:32,980
guys saying go to the pop us is where I get tech sharp tech, heavy tech, withering tech,

261
00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:47,099
sharp tech, withering tech, or hit tech. It's actually, are you sure? I said to go to pop us

262
00:43:47,659 --> 00:44:17,510
across the chat, save the game. Let's go for it. Arran tree. Hoppus. This was speed. Actually,

263
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:24,250
I kind of need speed. There's some chance to require a new technique and we'll deal with this

264
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:51,139
loser. You can do it. Nice job. Got it. That better be intelligence or I'm going to be really pissed

265
00:44:54,409 --> 00:45:04,539
and then we've got to get to over 400 intelligence so I can literally just spam that move. Nice.

266
00:45:05,179 --> 00:45:18,500
Get that speed over 100. Why are you so early? Because I didn't want to start streaming. Oh,

267
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:28,059
holy shit. I didn't want to start streaming at 430 again and have the stream be like eight

268
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:32,659
hours and go to like midnight again. So I figured I'd start like a couple hours early,

269
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:39,139
get some time in here, do the game awards and do some time after and not have it be too late.

270
00:45:40,099 --> 00:45:55,610
We'll see though. We'll see what I do. Very good. Polar bears. What the? Oh, I have to try to sneak

271
00:45:55,610 --> 00:46:10,019
through the fight. Why don't we just go around him? This feels so out of place. Did I do it? Oh no,

272
00:46:10,019 --> 00:46:30,969
he got me. Who's bait? Oh, was it bait? Or are you just, what is that smile? Uh oh. Very good.

273
00:46:30,969 --> 00:46:40,099
Keep it going. That's definitely a victory. Nice job. What's that? What's that gigantic

274
00:46:40,099 --> 00:46:57,699
thing? That big Griffin in the back. What is that? What is that? Wait, does he have the new move?

275
00:46:57,699 --> 00:47:11,769
Will he use it? Use the new move. You just got it. Use it. It's probably, it's probably at medium

276
00:47:11,769 --> 00:47:19,719
range. He's going to just keep doing a stupid shoulder tackle move. He's going to just not do

277
00:47:19,719 --> 00:47:31,590
anything but nudge. Let's see if he really is such an idiot. Let me see. Let's see the new move. Do

278
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:53,699
it. Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. That was the move. That was the move. That was like the

279
00:47:53,699 --> 00:47:59,860
galaxy beam. Why are you not hitting him? It's all right. You tried. That move looks sick though.

280
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:21,929
I'll take it. Now we stack intelligence and skill and hope I can like do 150 damage in that laser

281
00:48:21,929 --> 00:48:33,050
cosmic beam. All I'm going for is like a 60 plus percent hit chance to do 200 damage and hope I

282
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:59,210
don't die. Nice work. Now we rest. I want to see that technique. I want, this has to be at least

283
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:13,449
over 400. There it is. Strange light. It's got a terrible. All right. We really need to put. All

284
00:49:13,449 --> 00:49:23,210
right. Hold on. So physical attacks, your hit chances based on your, the hit percentage of the move

285
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:33,050
and your skill, right? Is intelligence also based on skill as well? Should I level up skill

286
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:40,659
to make this better to hit? Skill is hit for both kinds of attacks. Okay.

287
00:49:43,579 --> 00:49:51,099
C scaling on intelligence means sharpness. What the fuck does that mean? All right. We're sticking

288
00:49:51,099 --> 00:50:02,409
to the plan. Now I have enough money and we're going right for D by the way. Not yet. I'm going,

289
00:50:02,409 --> 00:50:12,760
we're going to rest. I'm going to go to the shop. Sharpness is crit rate. Damn cursor. Sorry about

290
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:26,920
that. All right. This is, we're in prime now. This is where we have to really hammer down skills.

291
00:50:27,719 --> 00:50:33,300
We are currently in, we are just, we just went into the prime stage of life. This is where we're

292
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:40,300
going to get like 20 fucking skill points. The training regimen needs to be done now,

293
00:50:40,300 --> 00:51:02,809
at least like three or four mint leaves and at least four, not oil. I can only buy two at a time.

294
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:11,739
I can only buy one at a time. The number of your allowed items has reached its maximum.

295
00:51:14,539 --> 00:51:20,199
Oh, she's given the star firm. Just eat the star firm. Will that be good? Is that a good idea?

296
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:32,469
Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hold on a minute. Yes. We're going to start that now. Star prune

297
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:56,519
become more famous. Now I can buy another one of these. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very good.

298
00:51:56,519 --> 00:52:13,159
Very good. This is now very crucial. So now we're going to do, I think I so train heavy training,

299
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:22,650
right? Not oil and then heavy training or heavy training. Then just by the way,

300
00:52:23,289 --> 00:52:26,250
if you want to unlock the ability, the least of unlocking the strongest intelligence ability

301
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:37,860
in the game, you need to have at least 500 intelligence. All right. Used a star prune

302
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:42,380
today. Oh shit, I did. I think I'll be all right. It won't be like completely ideal,

303
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:50,230
but I think I'll be fine. All right. Intelligence. We're just going for scaling here. Intelligence

304
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:59,829
and skill thankfully is the second one. I need at least 400. I want polish. What does he want?

305
00:52:59,829 --> 00:53:05,639
You want to eat like nail polish? He won't wait. He wants to polish his wall.

306
00:53:09,909 --> 00:53:21,639
Uh, should I give it to him? Sure. What is that? What is it? What did he want that for?

307
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:43,340
Okay. That means you better do a good job. All right. Plus 20 intelligence guys. I'm getting

308
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:59,619
this motherfucker to like 500 in tablets. All right. And now I'm almost broke again,

309
00:53:59,619 --> 00:54:05,050
but it's okay. Stick to the regimen. I will wipe the floor with everybody on a tournament.

310
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:34,650
Okay. Now it's mint, like drill, intelligence, not oil, heavy drill. I'm telling you,

311
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:51,079
I'm putting this guy on the top of the map. Hell yeah. Today is Cosmic Calamity's birthday.

312
00:54:52,619 --> 00:55:03,980
Are we saying something? Yes. Happy birthday Cosmic Calamity. You are my best friend.

313
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:17,019
Bro and be a strong monster. Oh my God. It rained on my birthday. Can we reschedule?

314
00:55:17,659 --> 00:55:33,539
Here's a big cake. I like the sound effects that like

315
00:55:42,809 --> 00:56:12,809
oil and be training. Do it. Where's this? This is a new place. What did he not know where to go?

316
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:20,840
Why was it in a cave? Well, you just screwed the whole thing up now.

317
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:46,760
You reached the next training level. Oh, get in that cave. Well, not in the cave though.

318
00:56:46,760 --> 00:57:08,820
You made him work on his birthday. I know I'm running out of money. I'll be fine. Not oil,

319
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:23,590
heavy drill. Worst birthday ever. So take us over 400, which then it's time to start destroying

320
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:38,869
tournaments. I want to get this right. This is cool. Got it. What, what is this intelligence?

321
00:57:38,949 --> 00:57:54,920
I don't understand. How is this intelligence? We were just in a cave. All right. Time for

322
00:57:54,920 --> 00:58:04,090
tournament meditating. Uh, you have mail. It's going to be air entry again, isn't it?

323
00:58:08,219 --> 00:58:18,440
Oh man. This is big deal. I got to buy a ton of these. It's a battle. All right. We're doing

324
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:34,489
this D cup tomorrow. Rest up. It's time. Mint leaf reduces stress. We're going to give you a nice

325
00:58:34,489 --> 00:58:43,269
full week of rest and then tomorrow we're doing the D cup and I've got over 400 intelligence.

326
00:58:43,989 --> 00:59:01,670
I will kill everything in one hit. Perfect. Go for it. I'll get disc chips. This is where it

327
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:12,780
matters here. This is very important. Incredibly important. This will determine if we can get this

328
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:24,039
guy to A rank. All right. What do we got for stats here? I remember Capella was pretty balanced

329
00:59:24,039 --> 00:59:32,489
across the board. We've got 415 intelligence. What do you got? Nothing. I'll kill you in one hit.

330
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:53,400
Oh, it's pretty good. It's pretty good. That was an 82% chance you don't even hit that.

331
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:10,840
Dude. Okay. Swing at him. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

332
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:16,679
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

333
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:30,940
no. What the fuck? I missed with an 80% chance twice. It's all right. I can lose one.

334
01:00:31,659 --> 01:00:49,909
Okay. Now it's all skill from here on out. Shit. If I hit you one time, you're going to die. Just die.

335
01:01:02,969 --> 01:01:19,380
Dead. When it works, it works. Yeah. 36% chance versus an 80% chance. Math problems are really,

336
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:35,400
really annoying, aren't they? Statistics suck. I'll get some money from this if I win,

337
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:39,960
which you have no defense. I just got to hit you one time. Look at the terrible speed. All right.

338
01:01:39,960 --> 01:02:08,920
I should be able to land this. I can't. Come on. Call it back. I'm holding left.

339
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:32,519
That's a lot. Especially if I get that to like 500. That will do at least 150 damage a hit. All

340
01:02:32,519 --> 01:02:44,179
right. Capella. Lose. Come on, Millium. Take him out. Still in it. We just actually have to land a

341
01:02:44,179 --> 01:02:50,389
coin flip in our favor. Start building defense so I don't get killed in one or two hits.

342
01:02:51,110 --> 01:03:14,329
Probably not a bad idea. All right, Millium. Here comes one hit Andy. And when it works,

343
01:03:14,329 --> 01:03:30,679
it's really, really good. Just have to try not to die. One of the game awards, like 30, 40 minutes.

344
01:03:30,679 --> 01:03:48,489
We're probably going to do like a pre-show, right? Pre-show of four and then it starts at 430. Yeah,

345
01:03:48,489 --> 01:04:11,960
we'll just go with 430. I got to piss. Nice. Very good. I want polish again.

346
01:04:15,369 --> 01:04:23,960
No, I'm sorry. Not this time. Why do you want a jar of pomade? You don't even have a hair.

347
01:04:27,079 --> 01:04:48,250
Now we stick with the training plan and buy a shitload of items. Sales not on anymore.

348
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:58,519
I want to keep at least a thousand in case it's an air entry. Oh, I seem well. What's the calendar

349
01:04:58,519 --> 01:05:08,309
look like? All right. So I'm going to do a light. I'm going to do a heavy training. Rest. And then

350
01:05:08,309 --> 01:05:35,110
we're going for the official D there. Okay. Rest. Yeah. Go for it. More damage. More damage. Did you

351
01:05:35,110 --> 01:05:59,829
do it? How do you cheat? Sorry. You still got eight. All right. Now we need to do stress and then

352
01:06:00,469 --> 01:06:19,000
rest or light training. Let's see. Okay. Light training, defense or health or skill. What do

353
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:28,420
you think? I don't know. Speed. Maybe defense. I think it's too loaded. I don't know. I feel like

354
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:39,530
speed needs to come up a little bit. Speed or health. I think I'm just going to go straight

355
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:49,159
health. Health and speed. Is there one that's speed and health? Defense and life. That's actually not

356
01:06:49,159 --> 01:06:57,769
a bad one to try. Let's just do life straight up because I can't have him do a heavy one.

357
01:06:59,739 --> 01:07:13,369
Straight up health. Next heavy one I'll do is swimming. How long do they live? That depends

358
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:22,630
on how stressed out, how fatigued they are and how well you treat them.

359
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:29,539
Tablets. Keep the training up at least for the next two or three weeks.

360
01:07:30,340 --> 01:07:51,909
Tablets are really expensive but they're just so good. So item. Use. Not soil. Heavy training. Swim.

361
01:07:51,909 --> 01:08:06,619
This is defense and life. Is there a life one? No. I feel like this is a waste. This is a waste

362
01:08:06,619 --> 01:08:19,239
though. Speed and intelligence. Leap. I think leap is far better. This lowers my intelligence.

363
01:08:19,239 --> 01:08:32,140
I don't know if I want to do that. I think it's leap. Leap is the play. Because having less than

364
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:38,649
100 speed is probably the reason why I'm just so easy to hit. Hit chance is so bad. Or so good on

365
01:08:38,649 --> 01:09:04,470
their end. All right. At least I got to get that shit to over 100. Stress mint leaf. You're easy

366
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:09,590
to hit because you're a brick wall. Well that's not really how it works. I'm breaking. I'm breaking

367
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:15,510
the uh. I'm gonna break this up a little bit. I'm gonna say screw it. I got the official

368
01:09:15,510 --> 01:09:25,539
tournament. I'm gonna do another heavy drill in a row. Then rest. Then tournament. That's the play.

369
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:57,369
Go again. Do it again. Finally. All right. Leveled up speed. Rest. Now we have the official D cup

370
01:09:58,170 --> 01:10:03,479
which after we beat that we'll be able to do the official C cup and this guy will be unbeatable.

371
01:10:04,279 --> 01:10:27,859
Go for it. You know what? Let's use the nuts oil for the tournament. All right. Let's let's clear

372
01:10:27,859 --> 01:10:35,909
it. Let's clean this up. Dare you participate in it? What do you wait? What? This is a higher

373
01:10:35,909 --> 01:10:45,460
grade tourney. Oh I didn't even do E yet. From the game awards. It's not until 430.

374
01:10:46,819 --> 01:11:06,060
I don't need to watch the pre-show. Yeah I'm going D. We're skipping a grade. Look I don't need to.

375
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:13,020
Let me focus on my what's important right now and that's getting this wall to rank B.

376
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:26,890
And then just farming money. All right. Palmer. I would rather just watch this than the game awards.

377
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:44,119
I don't want to rage quit the game awards but you know. All right. This guy's done. 135 damage.

378
01:11:44,119 --> 01:11:57,449
Almost killed him. Again. All right. Now don't be an idiot. It's okay. Those moves are so bad but

379
01:11:57,449 --> 01:12:04,569
it's a waste of guts to even do them. What about the smush? Smush is okay. I'd rather do smush than

380
01:12:04,569 --> 01:12:19,689
the slap. Not a problem. Not a problem. Not a problem. I would like to have a chance to do a move

381
01:12:19,689 --> 01:12:31,800
though. That'd be nice. Defused again. You know what? Let this guy just chip damage me until he

382
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:50,739
wins please. It's all right. Maybe I should just build speed for the rest of the time. I need 500

383
01:12:50,739 --> 01:12:57,340
though. I need at least to compete in B and A. Like to compete in B rank and A rank. S rank. I need at

384
01:12:57,340 --> 01:13:13,939
least 500 damage. 500 intelligence. Just nuke and stall. That's probably a good idea. I want

385
01:13:13,939 --> 01:13:36,380
one of those dogs. So bad. All right. Sakura Art. What do you look like? I gotta just get the hit.

386
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:55,210
I have to just get the beam. Build some guts first though. Not good. Shit. Now I have to just,

387
01:13:55,210 --> 01:14:06,100
I can't spend any. I don't want to go to zero guts. I won't hit anything. All right. Back it up.

388
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:11,779
Back it up. Push. Push. Push. Push. Push. Push away. How do you still have this much guts? What

389
01:14:11,779 --> 01:14:27,180
the? All right. Just fucking hit him with one of these and burn him. What the fuck? I didn't get

390
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:44,500
one hit. Not one single hit. I need more skill. I need more everything. It's a 46 to 51 percent

391
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:56,359
chance every time. And you can just lose, you can get heads 10 times in a row. I'm not, I haven't

392
01:14:56,359 --> 01:15:12,039
lost yet because everyone's lost at least once. So we're good. Your defense sucks. I just need

393
01:15:12,039 --> 01:15:20,100
to land this move. All right. Well, I need to get at least 200 skill and stay. Look, look at his two

394
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:26,149
moves. He can only attack if I'm in the first two slots and just here's the plane. Just never let

395
01:15:26,149 --> 01:15:44,460
him over here. Just hold left. Why is he getting closer? I'm holding left. It's not fair. I got

396
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:54,819
enough guts. Go for it. Please. You're doing six damage. I just need to hurt. Okay. All right.

397
01:15:54,899 --> 01:16:42,859
Fine. Fine. Sure. Yeah, that's fine. Hump them. Oh my God. One hit. All right. He sucks. All right.

398
01:16:42,859 --> 01:16:48,340
He actually sucks, but it's all right. We're going to make it work. This is good. This is good for us

399
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:53,380
to know. Cause now this means that I'm going to do, I'm going back and forth, intelligence,

400
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:56,659
skill, intelligence, skill, skill, intelligence, skill, skill, intelligence, intelligence, skill,

401
01:16:56,739 --> 01:17:09,699
intelligence, skill, skill. The next two months. Don't let me do anything else. If in the next

402
01:17:09,699 --> 01:17:15,140
10 minutes you see me go, Oh, you know, maybe like a little bit more speed. No, no. Scream at me.

403
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:20,920
I'm not going to do heavy drills. We're just going to go back and forth, back and forth, back and

404
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:28,920
forth, back and forth. If I hit this, it will do more, probably 200 damage. He has no intelligence

405
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:40,810
defense. Hit it. Thank you. I'll stay alive. Of course I hit this twice in a row on this guy.

406
01:17:41,449 --> 01:18:09,210
It's such horseshit. There's a chance I'm probably not going to win, but I might get some prize money

407
01:18:09,210 --> 01:18:30,170
if I win again. I think it goes all the way to third place. I got a P. Capella, what are you

408
01:18:30,170 --> 01:18:36,390
doing here? You're supposed to be on E rank. You get prize money if you're not dead last. That's

409
01:18:36,390 --> 01:19:04,300
good to know. I'm going to hang back. Stay back. He's going to, he has so much guts. I, it's so bad.

410
01:19:04,939 --> 01:19:08,119
He hasn't even been able to do a move the whole time. All right. Just kill him. 40%.

411
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:32,180
I need a new intelligence move. I do, but I think somebody said I need 500 intelligence

412
01:19:32,180 --> 01:19:43,640
to get it. It might be tricky to get because I think we're out of the prime age here.

413
01:19:44,439 --> 01:20:02,739
So we have monsters who are tied. Wait, wait, we all worth three and two.

414
01:20:04,659 --> 01:20:13,430
Wait a second. What? I beat this guy with no problem last time. I actually might win the

415
01:20:13,510 --> 01:20:21,859
tournament. I just have to get the hits. Don't throw. I'm going to try not to. All right,

416
01:20:21,859 --> 01:20:27,100
just stay back. I'm going to build up to like at least 70 guts as long as they stay out of the

417
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:32,779
second and first and second slot. He's getting closer. He pushed closer. Good thing. I dodged

418
01:20:32,779 --> 01:20:56,760
that. Okay. Now we go for it. I'll do it again. Just wait. All right, go. Lock it in. One shot

419
01:20:56,760 --> 01:21:08,420
Andy or he's useless. I know actually one shot Andy or useless. I can't believe I just won that

420
01:21:08,420 --> 01:21:25,399
tournament. What even determines where you're placed if it's a four ways high? I went above a

421
01:21:25,399 --> 01:21:31,159
rank here too. So I'll probably get some bonus fame for that because I skipped a rank, right?

422
01:21:32,039 --> 01:21:48,300
Oh, hell yeah. Almost 50 fame. My sister-in-law is here. Please make her. My sister-in-law is here.

423
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:54,550
Please make her leave. You are on the TV. I didn't deny another potential adrenaline.

424
01:21:55,189 --> 01:22:14,010
What are you talking about? I got some stats from that too, but very good. I want polish. All right,

425
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:24,819
we'll give you polish considering how well you did. Game awards is in like 15 minutes. All right,

426
01:22:24,819 --> 01:22:33,449
I gotta pee. I'm going to come back. We'll chill till the game awards and we're doing tablets

427
01:22:34,090 --> 01:22:44,010
because I still, I want to train a little bit more. That same regimen gone

428
01:22:44,649 --> 01:22:55,750
because I want to do heavy intelligence. Heavy. C is the official. This one's F, but I'll lose

429
01:22:55,750 --> 01:23:01,670
this one guaranteed. All right, the official C is in a month. I gotta pee. Leave. Hurry up.

430
01:23:03,930 --> 01:23:07,130
Uh, I'll be right back. We'll figure out when the game awards actually goes live.

431
01:23:07,850 --> 01:24:02,470
I'm like tangled up by this cord. How? All right, I'll be right back. Let's go. Now I know everybody's

432
01:24:02,470 --> 01:24:07,369
about to leave, but don't leave just yet. I know you're, you're thinking of leaving, but just hold

433
01:24:07,369 --> 01:24:11,850
on one second here. We've got another thing to check out here real quick. If you don't, don't

434
01:24:11,850 --> 01:24:18,520
leave yet. We are ready to continue to go. We're going to move right now after the game awards.

435
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:23,289
Hey, thanks Jeff for passing it over here, passing the mic over here. Uh, welcome everybody. Uh,

436
01:24:23,289 --> 01:24:26,729
we're showing this new thing that came out today. This is, I mean, we're showing trailer for games

437
01:24:26,729 --> 01:24:32,949
that are already out, but what we got here is monster rancher one into DX. And now the cool

438
01:24:32,949 --> 01:24:38,939
thing about this part about this game is you get to raise monsters, you get to battle them,

439
01:24:38,939 --> 01:24:52,279
and you get to not, uh, drop 70% viewership in 11 or 12 seconds. All right, let me change the

440
01:24:52,279 --> 01:25:01,479
category. You gained viewers. Did I? Well, not when I changed category. Was I, wait, wait, wait,

441
01:25:01,479 --> 01:25:20,920
was I in just chatting? Was I supposed to be somewhere else? Uh, okay. There's a special event.

442
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:31,000
Oh, okay. Let me change this to, oh, discussing, discussing our top picks from the game awards.

443
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:54,489
How about just wall coming in hot? A rank. I gotta, I gotta hurry up and I gotta hurry up.

444
01:25:54,489 --> 01:26:05,220
Monster rancher. There we go. All right. Welcome back everybody. What was my favorite thing in the

445
01:26:05,220 --> 01:26:12,260
game awards? Cuphead DLC. It's actually really cool. That's coming out. Very excited about that.

446
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:29,020
And that's it. Elden ring. Yeah. All right. Here we go. So where we left off here. Oh, the Star Wars

447
01:26:29,020 --> 01:26:41,079
game. That was kind of cool. Okay. So what the, I was going to be training minus 10 K views. Hurry

448
01:26:41,079 --> 01:26:48,279
up and be entertaining. It's still here. People are still here. Don't leave. All right. So the

449
01:26:48,279 --> 01:27:01,850
last thing we did was I ain't watching this shit ever again. Uh, I was in the middle of training,

450
01:27:01,850 --> 01:27:12,340
I think. Yeah. Cause when's the battle. So I wanted to do this. Don't forget what I was doing. I,

451
01:27:12,340 --> 01:27:20,069
no, I did this. Okay. See, we're going for this one. I'm going for C rank. So I was keep the

452
01:27:20,069 --> 01:27:29,029
training regimen going. I believe the last thing I did was I want to do a super drill or I was

453
01:27:29,829 --> 01:27:34,649
skill and intellect, skill and intellect, skill and intellect, skill and intellect.

454
01:27:34,649 --> 01:27:44,949
Let's do skill. Sorry. I got to leave. No, I'm just kidding around. You got to go. You got to go.

455
01:27:44,949 --> 01:28:03,659
We'll see you later. All right. I want this to get to 200. So let's do the stress leaf.

456
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:17,880
We're going to do intellect. Uh, just go back and forth between the two. I'm not going to do the

457
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:25,399
super powerful hard one. Maybe I'll do the hard one one more time on intellect. Try to get it over

458
01:28:25,399 --> 01:28:45,590
500. 500 int. Why is the teacher a toucan? Good question. Shit. I don't have any more. Um,

459
01:28:45,590 --> 01:28:57,079
I'm going to buy some more. I haven't blinked in four hours. What the fuck? Okay. By the way,

460
01:28:57,079 --> 01:29:13,800
get McDonald's later. I've decided it's definitely a McDonald's kind of night. Have you tried

461
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:25,350
Popeyes? I still haven't. I have to take the plunge. It's very loyal. Yeah. Loyalist guys.

462
01:29:25,909 --> 01:29:39,380
What about McChicken? No, no McChicken stream sequel. You can unlock beam. You got to do Papa's

463
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:46,380
Aaron tree again. I've got a pretty good chance to get it now. Papa's Aaron tree. All right. That's

464
01:29:46,380 --> 01:30:05,479
what we're going for. Definitely need more skill. Least 200. Nailed it. Look at this crazy bastard

465
01:30:05,479 --> 01:30:09,239
flying around. Now, thanks for watching. If you guys are just sticking around, I'm if you're new

466
01:30:09,239 --> 01:30:16,869
viewer, we fucking around 90% of things I say are not true. Um, we just have fun. Backtrack everything

467
01:30:16,869 --> 01:30:23,850
that was, I said that people didn't like this whole stream. Uh, we're going to do stress again.

468
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:33,750
Thanks for watching. Maybe we'll see you again. If not, happen to be your, your little home away

469
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:46,220
from home or your other streamers that you're watching. You better come back. Uh, intelligence.

470
01:30:46,859 --> 01:31:09,300
What speed intelligence at right now? Speed is pretty low. Ooh, that was a big one. 456. Uh,

471
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:43,909
cup of jelly. Alison knock, knock, joke, knock, knock, banana, knock, knock, banana. Hey, knock,

472
01:31:43,909 --> 01:32:05,029
knock orange orange. You glad I didn't say banana. I forgot to do my tick tock and whatever. Who

473
01:32:05,029 --> 01:32:18,899
cares? Holy shit. I laughed so hard. I pooped a blood vessel. Have that happen sometimes when

474
01:32:18,899 --> 01:32:40,220
you're hanging out here. It's fun and funny. All right. Skill again. I wonder what the success

475
01:32:40,859 --> 01:32:55,779
chance is because right now I wonder how much, how old he is. There's a B cup here,

476
01:32:55,779 --> 01:33:08,460
but no, I'm not ready for that. I'll try this. The actual, uh, see one. Maybe it's time to rest.

477
01:33:10,170 --> 01:33:21,640
I need to do Aaron tree after this. Okay. Let's do skill. It's a 200. Actually I have to rest.

478
01:33:22,279 --> 01:33:42,539
I have rated today. Let's see. Right. I mean, let's see. Right. So we got one,

479
01:33:43,180 --> 01:33:50,579
so one, two, three, four, five weeks until they see battle. I can still train.

480
01:33:51,380 --> 01:33:54,180
We should buy some more. Yeah. We'll do that. We'll do heavy train,

481
01:33:55,699 --> 01:34:04,710
heavy skill. One doesn't exist. I'll go for this. We'll go for meditate. I should get up level up.

482
01:34:13,210 --> 01:34:40,119
That was, that was great. Holy shit. Wow. Skill leveled up or 76 intelligence. Nice job. I need

483
01:34:40,119 --> 01:34:51,829
to buy. I get to buy some more of those. I don't want to go broke though. Thanks your boy for the

484
01:34:51,829 --> 01:35:05,579
10 community subs. Just one. All right. Don't go broke. What's this Hulk Hogan thing you're

485
01:35:05,579 --> 01:35:19,270
talking about? Stop. All right. Now we do intelligence again. Hey Dorsalis. Thanks for

486
01:35:19,270 --> 01:35:27,000
the 20 community subs, 20 community subs this time. Thank you. That's a lot of money. Thanks guys.

487
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:43,720
It's the lighting. You look like a monster. I think at this point I got over 200 skill

488
01:35:44,439 --> 01:35:47,800
stack intelligence. So I can't train them anymore. Try to get to like five or 600

489
01:35:53,909 --> 01:36:12,180
rate again. Damn. It's working hard. Always cup jellies. If you can't afford tablets,

490
01:36:12,180 --> 01:36:14,500
cup jellies, the only thing that really reduces stress that well.

491
01:36:15,060 --> 01:36:36,060
Official tournament. I'm fine. So the battle is, so we got nuts oil, heavy intelligence training,

492
01:36:40,279 --> 01:37:01,319
stress relief, light intelligence training, rest tournament. That was good to me. Why do you have

493
01:37:01,319 --> 01:37:13,449
a cosmic wall? I know it's weird meditate. Let's get another great 20, get it to 500.

494
01:37:14,010 --> 01:37:29,939
I think he failed. That's not good. I'm not too soft, right? Are you training a memory card?

495
01:37:33,819 --> 01:37:57,159
I could try and do it again. Try and do it again and we'll rest. Nice 500 intelligence. Now there's

496
01:37:57,159 --> 01:38:13,739
no way I don't make it to at least a no way rest up today into this week, move into the C

497
01:38:13,739 --> 01:38:25,210
tournament. I need to get another move. I do, but I need money. Our entries are two thousand dollars,

498
01:38:25,210 --> 01:38:46,899
which I don't have. What do you think? I got 500 intelligence. Is that asking too much? I'll just

499
01:38:46,899 --> 01:38:54,500
say that. That's this is a big tournament too. Would you ever wear Heely's? No, I feel like I

500
01:38:54,500 --> 01:39:07,939
would be walking and I would slip and crack my skull on the back of a pavement. We just have to

501
01:39:07,939 --> 01:39:17,689
make sure that we land attacks. This guy here is a huge problem and has really high intelligence,

502
01:39:17,689 --> 01:39:31,000
but I have a lot more. Just got to land it at speed 375. This is going to be rough. 50%.

503
01:39:34,869 --> 01:39:39,829
Oh, excuse me. It was a bad idea. I just melted his face off.

504
01:39:48,010 --> 01:39:51,449
By the way, getting KO'd in one hit is really bad for your character apparently.

505
01:39:52,170 --> 01:39:58,039
Getting KO'd is really bad, but I actually, this is not even a joke. This is like baked into the

506
01:39:58,039 --> 01:40:04,579
game's code somewhere. I took like four months off of that person's life. Something like that.

507
01:40:05,380 --> 01:40:15,460
Getting KO'd like that is really bad for your monster. Yeah, you can get injured. You can get

508
01:40:15,460 --> 01:40:31,000
sent to the hospital and die. Let's get a cosmic brownie. All right, what do I want from McDonald's?

509
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:39,109
What do you think? I'm thinking there's a new German 985 meal by the way. It's a 10 piece nugget

510
01:40:39,109 --> 01:40:46,949
with a powerade, sweet and sour sauce, honey mustard, and two double cheeseburgers without

511
01:40:46,949 --> 01:41:04,340
pickles. That's the new meal as official at this point. Don't forget the apple pie.

512
01:41:05,539 --> 01:41:13,739
I'm not so sure anymore. The McChickens are a single item. I get like one or two of them.

513
01:41:13,739 --> 01:41:17,380
I used to get a McChicken as well, but I have to cut back. You can't eat that much

514
01:41:17,380 --> 01:41:30,409
fast food. It's too much. It's going to be tricky, but I will have really high defense

515
01:41:30,409 --> 01:41:47,020
versus all the things you're doing. That hurt, but 29%. Jeez. Oh, all right. The percentages

516
01:41:47,020 --> 01:42:10,229
suck, but I have to try to just hit them once. 33%. Come on. Nice. What do I need? I have plenty

517
01:42:10,229 --> 01:42:34,039
of intelligence. I need more skill. Another four months gone. Flash Royale taunt. I just beat

518
01:42:34,039 --> 01:42:40,729
S-Frank with my pixie. Can I ask, what were your stats? What were your main stats and how high were

519
01:42:40,729 --> 01:42:55,369
they? I got to figure out when I should slow down. Nice. Am I facing? I lost that person's name. I

520
01:42:55,369 --> 01:43:02,729
found out who it was. I wanted to know what their stats were. All right. Yeah, I might not kill it

521
01:43:02,729 --> 01:43:13,479
in one hit, but I will kill it in two hits. High speed, unfortunately. Eyes. I'm going to stay back

522
01:43:14,039 --> 01:43:23,300
because the only thing you can do is this move that's not going to hurt me. All right. Now you're

523
01:43:23,300 --> 01:43:32,229
in trouble. Oh, that's a lot. I don't think there's even a crit either. With a crit,

524
01:43:32,949 --> 01:44:00,010
you're probably killed. All right. Slow down. Slow down. 275. Play that giggly sound effect again?

525
01:44:00,010 --> 01:44:12,979
No. This character is overpowered. This character is built very stupidly. This is apparently one

526
01:44:12,979 --> 01:44:19,619
of the worst characters in the game. The worst monster and subtype combination. But with

527
01:44:20,659 --> 01:44:28,380
perseverance, you can get these two moves that you just have to flip a coin and win.

528
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:36,260
But later on, I bet I fall off horribly. 800 intelligence, 500 skills, 600 speed.

529
01:44:36,979 --> 01:44:52,649
How'd you do that? What? How'd you get 800 intelligence? I'm struggling to get

530
01:44:53,539 --> 01:45:08,220
600 before this guy dies. Okay. Again, intelligence only. Let's go. That's not good.

531
01:45:08,220 --> 01:45:34,340
Just pissed you off. That's fine. All right. Just, just, just bump. Bump again. They said light drill

532
01:45:34,340 --> 01:45:46,409
three times, rest on fourth with mint leaf. You don't do any heavy drills at all? I think these

533
01:45:46,489 --> 01:46:05,699
are a really good base. They said never. Really? I've seen different, seems like the book is out

534
01:46:05,699 --> 01:46:10,979
though. I've heard that alternating between heavy and light, heavy and light with nut oil in between

535
01:46:11,619 --> 01:46:16,979
is a good strategy. These are like the four or five different ways to train. There's also drugs.

536
01:46:17,939 --> 01:46:23,989
You can, you can get like tons of drug training, right? Which I have no idea how that happens. But

537
01:46:23,989 --> 01:46:29,270
I know you take like a year or two off of the life of the monster and you just drug train them.

538
01:46:29,989 --> 01:46:35,460
It's expensive though. So I think you have to do that once you're able to buy, you know,

539
01:46:35,460 --> 01:46:41,739
win a bunch of money. They fixed the bug stats so this character isn't shit tier anymore. Okay.

540
01:46:51,829 --> 01:47:03,350
Oh, yikes. Uh, okay. This character is just me, but physical because all he needs to do is hit me

541
01:47:03,350 --> 01:47:29,510
one time, but it goes the same way. I get to go first. Oh, he's only got two moves right in the

542
01:47:29,510 --> 01:47:53,829
front. Uh, have I secured it? I need to win one more and I win. So coming up next week,

543
01:47:54,869 --> 01:48:08,229
when am I going to stream again? I feel like Monday, Monday and Tuesday. I'll be back on

544
01:48:08,229 --> 01:48:12,760
Monday and I'm not done yet. I'll be done. I'm probably not going to stream for that much longer

545
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:19,319
though. Uh, but I'll be back on Monday. We'll probably do Monday, Tuesday or Monday, Wednesday

546
01:48:20,199 --> 01:48:27,770
or Monday, Thursday. Uh, we can do baby sensory and you laugh, you lose. I want to set that up for

547
01:48:27,770 --> 01:48:36,039
next week. So I'm trying to think of, I'm probably going to talk to the mods because I want to set

548
01:48:36,039 --> 01:48:42,539
up at least some, you laugh, you lose stuff for next week. Also, I want to make this really clear

549
01:48:42,539 --> 01:48:47,579
too. The nominations are still open in the discord. So if you want to nominate something for worst or

550
01:48:47,579 --> 01:48:53,500
best thing of the year, um, go to the discord. It's the new year's eve discussion, new year's

551
01:48:53,500 --> 01:49:00,710
eve nominations. It's still open. It'll be open till the 15th. So if there's a noise or a face

552
01:49:00,710 --> 01:49:07,670
or a gross hair or a sound that you liked, you have still have about six or seven days to do it.

553
01:49:09,220 --> 01:49:28,819
Stop. It's there. Let's win this tournament now. Discord. Let's win this. I'll be happy if I can

554
01:49:28,819 --> 01:49:34,100
get to a B rank over, get to a rank tonight, which should not be that long after this. I think I'm

555
01:49:34,100 --> 01:49:46,600
doing a lot of damage. I would like to get that skill up though. Maybe we'll focus on skill.

556
01:49:47,239 --> 01:50:13,020
All right. All right. All right. Settle down. Where can I play this on steam right now? It's

557
01:50:13,020 --> 01:50:24,039
on steam. It's on switch and it's on iPad. It's on iOS. Uh, I still win the game. I'm the only

558
01:50:24,039 --> 01:50:47,960
person with one loss. What haven't I fought yet? Well, it says one loss. Is it gun burn? Okay. So

559
01:50:47,960 --> 01:51:02,949
I'll have to fight him twice. I don't want to get that far though. Let's go. It's going to be hard.

560
01:51:02,949 --> 01:51:20,359
I'm going to stay back. Try to get to like 70 or 80 guts. All right. Go bad. Really bad.

561
01:51:21,079 --> 01:51:51,350
Don't get so confused. Come on, dude. All right. Get it. Stop. 36%. 33. Oh,

562
01:51:52,069 --> 01:51:54,710
just stay back. Stay back, stay back, stay back, stay back, back, back, back, back, back, back,

563
01:51:54,710 --> 01:51:58,229
back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back.

564
01:51:58,229 --> 01:52:09,829
I got stun locked. Oh my God. My neck just cracked. Did you hear that? I was like,

565
01:52:15,859 --> 01:52:35,609
uh, I'm tied for first. All right. Huey, Huey needs to lose. I don't want to fight Huey.

566
01:52:45,449 --> 01:52:53,850
All right. Rematch for the championship. I just have to, I have to land it. It's just literally

567
01:52:53,850 --> 01:53:16,779
percentages. It's just RNG. I got to land it. Why does this motherfucker could do three moves in a

568
01:53:16,779 --> 01:53:24,180
row? Oh, all right. All right. This is now it's anybody's game. It's going to come down to the

569
01:53:24,180 --> 01:53:49,699
last hit. Fuck. Dodge it. Dodge it. Dodge it. I'm over. I lose. So he's not ready. So I, I,

570
01:53:49,699 --> 01:54:13,960
I wiped the floor with six straight people and I get this one dickhead that I'm not praising

571
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:23,560
because I want to keep him at even eat the tablets. Get back in the training field,

572
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:45,029
get back in the training zone. I got to get that skill up speed. I think is a,

573
01:54:45,029 --> 01:55:07,399
is a lost cause at this point. You need to win a tournament item. Use that nuts oil crane.

574
01:55:07,960 --> 01:55:25,819
Am I getting like, okay. Intelligence. Let's do meditation again. I want the skill and the

575
01:55:27,420 --> 01:56:17,050
make it great. Great. Come on. 16. Nice. We'll do light skill oil, heavy intelligence. Nice.

576
01:56:17,050 --> 01:56:48,220
You can skip the training cut scenes. I know I like to watch them. I think they're cute.

577
01:56:48,300 --> 01:57:20,039
More intelligence. I need that discount for the air entry. So bad. Come on. Discount even 90%

578
01:57:20,039 --> 01:57:28,619
chance to unlock Ray. Now from even 90% chance to unlock Ray from Korea entry air entry,

579
01:57:28,619 --> 01:57:36,659
which you really, really want it. Don't do pop us anymore. Do do Korea. All right. That sounds good.

580
01:57:37,220 --> 01:57:47,960
What item did I just use? What item did I just use right there right now?

581
01:57:59,909 --> 01:58:11,720
Mint. And then what did I do right after that skill mint and then see what I just do.

582
01:58:13,619 --> 01:58:32,859
I don't remember. I meditated. Okay. Holy shit. What's that? It's gonna be worth something huge,

583
01:58:32,859 --> 01:58:52,119
right? I'll take it. All right. Another nut oil, heavy training. All right. I, now I actually,

584
01:58:52,119 --> 01:59:05,800
this week I have to fight something. This is definitely air entry discount. Nice. Okay. All

585
01:59:05,800 --> 01:59:10,779
right. All right. All right. All right. Right. When are the battles? Another male piece of male.

586
01:59:11,340 --> 01:59:36,090
I got to pull. Um, I got to pull them out of retirement because I need to do like all of these.

587
01:59:36,729 --> 01:59:57,659
We got to go get a bug Batman to do see. Yeah. Cause I need the money so I can send him to air

588
01:59:57,659 --> 02:00:08,310
entry. Yeah. I'm going to go do it. One last job here. Okay. I'll do one more drill and then I'm

589
02:00:08,310 --> 02:00:36,380
going to freeze them. Right. I think he cheated. It's okay. I loyalty too. Yeah. Let's go bring,

590
02:00:36,380 --> 02:00:55,180
uh, bug Batman out of retirement. I need that money. I should fuse them. I actually, I looked

591
02:00:55,180 --> 02:01:10,680
at it. It didn't look like I was going to get anything good as a tournament of the IMA versus

592
02:01:10,680 --> 02:01:14,359
Fimbo. You need to win it and attend the meeting after to unlock four breeds. If you don't, you

593
02:01:14,359 --> 02:01:23,579
have to wait four more years. Well, let me focus on a winning a B tournament because I don't know

594
02:01:23,579 --> 02:01:43,340
if I'm going to be able to do any of that. How are you anyways? You okay? I need to place now.

595
02:01:43,340 --> 02:01:50,699
I have to place. If not, then I have to keep this guy here and do this tournament just to get a

596
02:01:50,699 --> 02:02:17,640
thousand. All right. We got a place because he's technically B rank, right? One's dead. What's the

597
02:02:17,720 --> 02:02:29,979
strategy with this guy? Uh, I stab. This is a melee fighter and I got three moves and mainly

598
02:02:29,979 --> 02:02:35,779
I'm just, you try to use this man. I unlocked this one in the front and it's all about just stab.

599
02:02:35,779 --> 02:03:02,149
It's got a high hit percentage. He's usually does have to place. Nice. Stay in close. Don't go that

600
02:03:02,149 --> 02:03:33,270
far away. Why did that do so much damage? Oh, fuck off. Attack who has more health. I think I have

601
02:03:33,270 --> 02:03:46,600
more percentage health, right? Yes. Just win one more. I don't care about winning the tournament.

602
02:03:46,600 --> 02:03:54,899
I care about his prize money. Good luck beating this guy as a melee character, by the way.

603
02:03:55,460 --> 02:04:15,979
Somebody else has to beat him. I'm biting my lip. Stop. Stop it. Stop biting. Don't bite your lip.

604
02:04:15,979 --> 02:04:37,880
I always do this. I'm sorry. The camera's off. I need guts. So let him just kind of hang out here.

605
02:04:38,680 --> 02:05:18,420
Good dodge. Oh, he was confused. I had a chance. Not yet. Not yet. Not yet. Now you piece of shit.

606
02:05:18,420 --> 02:05:23,350
Get in there. I have so much guts. Just don't care. The clock is counting down.

607
02:05:27,369 --> 02:05:36,699
Okay. He said they're doing this big. Oh, I'm guarding now animation. So you got five seconds

608
02:05:36,699 --> 02:05:55,109
left. Get in there and attack Jerry. You were winning. I don't think I was. He lost. Perfect.

609
02:05:55,109 --> 02:06:05,369
Okay. I need to, if I lose this and it's, I have to fight this guy twice. Good luck. This is going

610
02:06:05,369 --> 02:06:14,979
to be horrible. I don't think I'm going to win. No way. I just have to rely on this dude missing

611
02:06:16,539 --> 02:06:28,119
a lot. So I'm going to pull back. Just bounce, bounce him away. Bounce him away.

612
02:06:28,920 --> 02:06:33,479
I want a ton of guts so I can just stab, stab, stab, stab, stab when there's like 10 seconds

613
02:06:33,479 --> 02:07:05,399
left. Pull him in. Push. Miss. Oh, yikes. All right. Here we go. Got all the prize money.

614
02:07:05,399 --> 02:07:24,149
Oh, we got it. We got advice here. Both Ray. It goes into the four slot, both Ray and beam.

615
02:07:24,149 --> 02:07:32,010
So Ray goes into the first slot. You really end up wanting both. You have to use the move 50 times.

616
02:07:32,010 --> 02:07:37,529
Let's you unlock the upgrade. I definitely want Ray. That sounds like a death move. So we're going

617
02:07:37,529 --> 02:07:45,479
to, we're going to call Ria. You did what you were supposed to do bug Batman. Thank you so much.

618
02:07:46,119 --> 02:08:24,380
Excellent job. We get a little bonus too. Exactly. I'm just so just breaking even. Oh right.

619
02:08:24,380 --> 02:08:35,340
Cause I dropped down a rank. Wait, this is okay. If I combine these two eventually,

620
02:08:36,659 --> 02:08:48,659
something will have way higher base stats, right? If I combine bug Batman and calamity,

621
02:08:50,789 --> 02:09:04,100
base stats could be monstrous. I would give you rest right now, but I can't. We have to go back

622
02:09:04,100 --> 02:09:10,520
to town and I need to bring the other guy back so I can do the air entry. So you can take a rest

623
02:09:10,520 --> 02:09:43,930
here. Come on out. Just let him die. He's come out of retirement too many times. We're not going to

624
02:09:43,930 --> 02:09:53,960
need him again. So it looks like it's going to be rest and then air entry. This is still the same

625
02:09:53,960 --> 02:10:18,119
month, right? Save the game. Rest up. You're going on an errand next week. It's time to spend all of

626
02:10:18,119 --> 02:10:41,750
my money. Why these, why these expensive again? Wasn't this for this month? I thought it was for

627
02:10:41,750 --> 02:11:04,979
the month. It's only for one week. Oh shit. That sucks. Do I give him this Nigel before he goes

628
02:11:04,979 --> 02:11:11,529
on air entry? This is straight up drugs. Should I make him take these drugs? Are these performance

629
02:11:11,529 --> 02:11:36,140
enhancing drugs? No, no, don't. Okay. What about a tasty mango? Here, have a tasty mango. All right,

630
02:11:36,140 --> 02:12:02,199
here we go. We need to go to Korea. Korea? I don't have Korea. I don't have it. What should I do?

631
02:12:03,159 --> 02:12:12,600
Just back to Papas and get the other one. Oh, I have to go to rank B. I can get an intelligence

632
02:12:12,600 --> 02:12:23,079
tech here though, right? I mean, it's worth doing. I'm not going to. Yeah, Papas is fine. Okay. All

633
02:12:23,079 --> 02:12:47,989
right. Speed and life. I don't want speed in life. All right. Fight a D level monster. All right,

634
02:12:47,989 --> 02:13:04,630
how about this rabbit? All right, let's see it. Should breeze through this. I could skip it,

635
02:13:04,630 --> 02:13:14,100
but I like the suspense. Got the skill. Hopefully it's the intelligence one. Awesome.

636
02:13:29,189 --> 02:13:47,590
Mm. Ice quake. I think I failed this last time. I need 40 fame and 140 health. Does this guy not

637
02:13:47,590 --> 02:14:21,899
have 100? Does that not have 40 fame? I play it higher than that. Yeah, I think I got it.

638
02:14:21,899 --> 02:14:26,300
Then when he's, and I don't, by the way, I don't control the monster when you get the random fight

639
02:14:26,300 --> 02:14:50,869
at the end. If I do it just happened. All right. You got it. You got a technique. You're good.

640
02:14:50,869 --> 02:15:20,869
Easy. Were you guys betting on that? The Korea expedition is only available during June week one.

641
02:15:20,869 --> 02:15:39,020
What? It's available for one. I saw I missed it by one, like two minutes. All right. Rest up

642
02:15:49,430 --> 02:16:05,619
tablet. So I'm going to try to do that training regimen again. And this time I will try to actually

643
02:16:05,619 --> 02:16:13,239
win the tournament. Try to go to B rank. All right. You're stressed out. I got it. I got it.

644
02:16:13,239 --> 02:16:51,559
I got it. Remember, look at me. Let's take a look at this move. What is it? I got it. So this is,

645
02:16:51,559 --> 02:17:04,139
takes a lot of mana, 24 guts, but has a much better hit percentage than this

646
02:17:06,809 --> 02:17:16,409
beam. I'm just going to use this every time and it's max range. I can literally just sit back

647
02:17:16,409 --> 02:17:24,180
and just be a camper. That's pretty good. Very cool. All right. Let's start the training regimen.

648
02:17:24,180 --> 02:17:35,659
We're going heavy intelligence and skill, and then we're going to go light skill. You want to play?

649
02:17:38,469 --> 02:17:46,219
I hate that mini game. No, I'm sorry. That mini game sucks. It's the snowball one. I don't want

650
02:17:46,219 --> 02:17:52,569
to play it. I know people are going to think I'm a dick. I know. I really don't want to play it.

651
02:17:54,219 --> 02:17:59,180
Now he's sad and he's sad because I wouldn't play with him this week and I was going to be pissed.

652
02:18:13,510 --> 02:18:51,639
Reset. Right again. He's fine. 561, encroaching on that probably did 600 intelligence.

653
02:18:52,360 --> 02:19:07,770
Now we're going to do skill. Oh, eat your McDonald's. I'm good. I'll be right.

654
02:19:07,770 --> 02:19:15,930
Somebody has a guide for what I should do after B rank. Let me just copy that on the clipboard.

655
02:19:27,299 --> 02:19:45,860
Nice. That's going to be at least a eight to 10, right? It worked. Is this game fun? This game's

656
02:19:45,860 --> 02:20:01,819
very fun. Skill is your hit chance. So the higher my skill and the lower their speed, the better

657
02:20:01,819 --> 02:20:11,909
chance I have to actually hit percentage on all my moves. Click the link. Yeah. I'll look at it later.

658
02:20:13,959 --> 02:20:36,440
Actual good link. That's the guide, isn't it? Give me over 600. It's a picture of your face. Oh,

659
02:20:36,440 --> 02:20:56,969
okay. There is no way I don't win C cup now. I feel like it's impossible. Tablets again. I need

660
02:20:56,969 --> 02:21:20,809
to get to 600. His fame is at 69. I need more mint leaves. What do you think? If you like it,

661
02:21:20,809 --> 02:21:26,649
get some. Okay. Then I got baited into buying and eating one of those and I don't even know what it

662
02:21:26,649 --> 02:21:43,829
did. The link sucks. I'm not clicking it. All right. I'm almost at zero dollars. Don't fuck

663
02:21:43,829 --> 02:22:09,620
around here. What's the next tournament? Oh, eat dinner. I'll be okay. I'm fine. I'm going to stop

664
02:22:09,620 --> 02:22:17,610
streaming in like 2030 minutes. We're going to play this again. Don't worry. This is my new favorite

665
02:22:17,610 --> 02:22:23,879
game ever. So I'm playing again. I, I told you, I am not going to stop playing this till I at least

666
02:22:23,879 --> 02:22:39,209
beat S rank. Oh, this guy's dead. And what? Look at this. I'm going to kill this guy and actually,

667
02:22:39,209 --> 02:23:12,840
actually one hit. In fact, I might kill him instantly. Oh, stay back. What the fuck happened?

668
02:23:12,840 --> 02:23:22,860
What happened? You got to be kidding me, dude. What even happened? I couldn't even attack him.

669
02:23:25,350 --> 02:23:34,629
I have, that guy has 43 intelligence. I have almost six freaking hundred. Why would he, I not

670
02:23:34,629 --> 02:23:42,840
kill him instantly. Well, now I need the, I need to come in second place. Otherwise I'm not going

671
02:23:42,840 --> 02:23:56,200
to get any prize money. See what I'm talking about? This guy just rolled that guy. That guy

672
02:23:56,200 --> 02:24:02,659
just rolled that guy up in a burrito and ate his ass. Ate him. I ate him up. I swallowed him up.

673
02:24:02,659 --> 02:24:22,299
I swallowed him up. And I killed him. Sussvane, you piece of shit. Now you're guaranteed to win.

674
02:24:27,459 --> 02:24:46,309
Utter dog shit. That's what's supposed to be happening. I'm supposed to be drilling their

675
02:24:46,309 --> 02:24:55,270
teeth out with a little teeth driller. There's no reason why I should have lost that. Tell me,

676
02:24:55,270 --> 02:25:01,510
Sussvane, please lose. He's got one more fight. Can we kill Sussvane, please? So I can beat his

677
02:25:01,510 --> 02:25:12,659
ass. Thank you. It's a rematch time. I'm going to melt his face off. That was such a fluke. Absolute

678
02:25:12,659 --> 02:25:23,350
fluke. 43 intelligence. Give me a break. Let's kill him in one hit. Three, two, one, die motherfucker.

679
02:25:24,170 --> 02:25:27,850
That's what was supposed to happen. And I don't know what happened, but I like must have taken

680
02:25:27,850 --> 02:25:48,600
money to fall because there's no way I don't kill him in one hit. I got money again. We do

681
02:25:48,600 --> 02:26:05,129
vigorous training. And then I'm going to go eat McDonald's. 3000. You ate his ass, bro.

682
02:26:05,770 --> 02:26:12,940
Ooh, star prune. I'm about to beat a hundred fame. I'm going to be the most famous monster.

683
02:26:20,680 --> 02:26:37,940
Nice. A seven speed. That's awesome. I want polish. All right. Yeah, sure. Then I'm going to have to

684
02:26:37,940 --> 02:26:42,180
know what this is. He keeps asking me for this. I've spent a thousand dollars in hair cream for

685
02:26:42,180 --> 02:26:58,409
this guy. What does it do? He eats it. But what does it actually do? It's minus stress. Oh, okay.

686
02:26:58,969 --> 02:27:11,559
It's time to do training. When's the next official tournament? All right. I'm going to beat this

687
02:27:11,559 --> 02:27:38,139
tournament. We're going to be rank and then I'm going to go eat McDonald's. Let's train. I'd like

688
02:27:38,139 --> 02:28:12,180
to see skill at 300 and intelligence at like 700. I'll eat a salad. I'm not clicking the link.

689
02:28:13,319 --> 02:28:38,649
You're not getting me to click a link. Do an IRL stream at McDonald's. All right, fine. I'm going

690
02:28:38,649 --> 02:28:53,959
to click it. I'll click it and be done with it. I need a mod to link it to me. What is it? Click

691
02:28:53,959 --> 02:28:59,530
it. I need a mod. There's no links in this chat anymore. You guys have used that for so many years

692
02:28:59,530 --> 02:29:18,139
that I had to delete it. All right. What is it? This is what we've been fighting about. This is

693
02:29:18,139 --> 02:29:36,409
what I needed to see. I had to see this. This is what I needed to see. Very, very important.

694
02:29:42,139 --> 02:29:45,420
All right. This is the last training session I'm going to do before I get him to this tournament

695
02:29:45,420 --> 02:30:10,040
and the gas. Then I'll see you guys again on Monday. Your audio is distinct. It's the camera.

696
02:30:10,040 --> 02:30:12,840
It's because the exposure is high because I don't have enough light in this room.

697
02:30:12,840 --> 02:30:33,510
It's because when my camera's exposure has to be so turned up that turn off your webcam.

698
02:30:33,510 --> 02:30:43,260
Turns out you're the horror. Yeah, I just don't have any professional equipment.

699
02:30:43,260 --> 02:31:04,659
But I don't want to ring light in my face. That sucks. I don't want to do that. What did I say?

700
02:31:04,659 --> 02:31:35,420
What was rude? There we go. Tell me if this fixes it. I'm curious. Okay. Ready? Tell me

701
02:31:35,420 --> 02:31:54,600
if this fixes it. Hey, hi. My name is German95. Good to see you. How are you? Does it work? Is it

702
02:31:54,600 --> 02:32:23,139
better? You see? This sucks. Is it what you're seeing? Hey, does it actually work now? Is it

703
02:32:23,139 --> 02:32:36,280
better? Because my exposure is way down. Yes. Is the frame rate better? Because I can't fix it.

704
02:32:36,280 --> 02:32:48,860
It got worse? How would it have gotten worse? This is what it has to look like right now.

705
02:32:48,860 --> 02:33:02,090
Maybe I'll get a light. Should I get a light? If I had a light that was like here. Like right here.

706
02:33:02,090 --> 02:33:33,780
Or like here. Here. Maybe. Maybe. All right. I gotta go. Let's train. When's the tournament?

707
02:33:33,780 --> 02:33:44,700
Now my eyes are blinking. All right. We're going to do. I want to do this one more time and then

708
02:33:44,700 --> 02:34:02,040
we're going to rest. Fuck it. And then I got the tournament and I'm going to beat it. I do so much

709
02:34:02,120 --> 02:34:23,100
damage. I'm going to just rock everybody here. Now I can rest. Tournament. Bingo. Very well.

710
02:34:24,549 --> 02:34:31,219
Battle. C. All right. This is the big one. I'm ready. And after this, I'm like literally have

711
02:34:31,219 --> 02:34:36,809
to run out of here. I gotta, I gotta get food. You're blinking a lot. Are you okay? I was just

712
02:34:36,809 --> 02:34:55,000
holding a wicked bright ass light in my face. I see like splotches. I'm going to try to kill

713
02:34:55,000 --> 02:35:02,600
everybody in one second. If, if it works, it works. And I'm going to annihilate everybody.

714
02:35:02,600 --> 02:35:43,290
Like this. Good. Very, very good. Minus four months on that dick. That's suspene. Come on,

715
02:35:43,290 --> 02:35:53,209
bring on suspene. You're in the tournament too. Why don't you play cookie run kingdom?

716
02:35:53,209 --> 02:35:58,549
I mean, you're acting like I already haven't spent $5,000 on that game and I'm embarrassed to tell

717
02:35:58,549 --> 02:36:15,700
you. I haven't. All right. Who cares? Oh, it's just a snap of my fingers.

718
02:36:17,940 --> 02:36:49,139
That was so loud. Wasn't it? Let's make it eight. No, this is the only going to work until it

719
02:36:49,139 --> 02:36:53,940
doesn't because when I get to A and S, I'm not going to be able to fuck around like this anymore.

720
02:36:54,739 --> 02:36:59,860
I just want to unlock the new monsters because I know you unlock at least four or five breeds

721
02:36:59,860 --> 02:37:08,459
when you get to rank B or after rank B. Oh, gun burn. Oh, hey, it's good to see you. I just

722
02:37:08,459 --> 02:37:17,100
was curious if you wanted to potentially, my hands are so sweaty. I couldn't snap and it wasn't funny.

723
02:37:21,819 --> 02:37:37,319
You, it was actually like slippery. No, this is not the B tournament, but what if when I

724
02:37:37,319 --> 02:37:50,950
beat the B tournament, I will unlock some more breeds. We can go searching. I'm speed running.

725
02:37:50,950 --> 02:38:43,459
I know I'm just hungry. Die already. Just pull back. Pull back. Oh my fucking God. I'm going to

726
02:38:43,459 --> 02:38:57,219
lose. No, I'm not 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. I got flaws victory because like this,

727
02:38:57,219 --> 02:39:03,239
I just, I shot them. Like I shot like six beams and not one of them hit. I'm still going to win

728
02:39:03,239 --> 02:39:08,809
the tournament and I'm getting outside. I'm slashing that Zambor's fucking tires. Okay.

729
02:39:11,860 --> 02:40:07,610
It's a tournament. All right. Only two, only three more. I don't want to get too late.

730
02:40:07,610 --> 02:40:18,149
I'm very, very hungry. All right, Nicole. Okay. If this fight takes more than three seconds,

731
02:40:18,149 --> 02:40:26,729
I will piss my pants on scream one, two, two and a half, two and a quarter,

732
02:40:27,690 --> 02:40:32,969
two and a two thirds, two and two fourths, three and four eights, three and four fifths, four and

733
02:40:33,770 --> 02:40:38,809
three and two fourths, two fourths and two fourths, two fourths and three fifths,

734
02:40:38,809 --> 02:40:49,209
two eights and one eight, two eights and four eighties, one and one two fourths, two and a half,

735
02:40:49,209 --> 02:41:23,459
Two and two...seventy orders...and...two and two fiftieths...four and three-fifths...two and three...shit.

736
02:41:23,459 --> 02:42:08,229
I can't...I can't believe I lost that. That was so stupid.

737
02:42:16,680 --> 02:42:20,520
Now I'm not gonna win the tournament. I have to win the next two. I have to...this sucks.

738
02:42:20,520 --> 02:42:41,479
If I don't win this in one second, I will piss my pants again. One...nice.

739
02:42:41,479 --> 02:42:46,409
All right, who else has two losses? It's Nicole. I can still win the championship.

740
02:42:46,409 --> 02:42:51,610
Let's go. Come on. Nicole lose to Suspain. What a...oh my god. Pathetic.

741
02:42:53,180 --> 02:43:11,639
I won. I'm the only one with two losses. That's game over. I win. GG. Good job.

742
02:43:11,639 --> 02:43:15,370
All right. I need to go get food. I gotta get some food.

743
02:43:18,940 --> 02:43:23,159
I'm gonna make my own McDonald's. I'm gonna make the secret sauce. I'm gonna make my patty.

744
02:43:23,159 --> 02:43:27,000
I'm gonna make the lettuce. I'm gonna make cheese and shit. I'm gonna make my own Big Mac.

745
02:43:37,850 --> 02:43:41,100
All right. I'll see you guys later. I actually am gonna run away now,

746
02:43:41,100 --> 02:43:46,760
but this is great because now I can probably do the same thing in B rank.

747
02:43:46,760 --> 02:43:52,379
Excellent work. Am I gonna play more of this? Absolutely. I refuse to give up on this game

748
02:43:52,379 --> 02:43:58,739
unless I beat S rank at least. If you were watching for the game awards,

749
02:43:59,219 --> 02:44:02,940
uh, thanks for watching. I had a good time. It was really fun.

750
02:44:03,829 --> 02:44:07,510
And obviously Monster Rancher is a ton of fun too. We're gonna continue Monster Rancher and

751
02:44:07,510 --> 02:44:15,209
baby sensory videos next week as part of a You Laugh You Lose challenge. And we'll be able to

752
02:44:15,209 --> 02:44:22,870
pick it up immediately on a half-off errant tree, which is awesome. Have a good weekend, guys.

753
02:44:23,590 --> 02:44:43,739
Let me save this. Nice and saved. Awesome. All right. I'll see you guys later. Really

754
02:44:43,739 --> 02:44:49,500
appreciate everybody watching. Take care of yourselves. I'm gonna let the end play out.

755
02:44:50,059 --> 02:45:03,579
Take care, guys. See you on Monday, Monday the 13th. Good night. Thanks for all the subs. There's

756
02:45:03,579 --> 02:46:36,520
a lot of gifted subs too. Here you all are right now. See you guys later. Okay. Good night,

757
02:46:36,520 --> 02:46:55,129
everybody. Stream is ending. Yeah. Good night.
