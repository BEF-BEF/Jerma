00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:50,729
Hello. How you doing? Doing pretty good. On time. It's funny that I can be four or five

2
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:55,799
minutes late and still be considered on time. I appreciate that. Thanks for giving me the uh,

3
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:14,859
the extra leeway. Oh it's 6.05! He's on time! Not really. But better. Better. Okay. So hello.

4
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:26,140
I'm gonna play some mercenaries today. Came out today. I remember playing this on the old Resident

5
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:37,980
Evil 4. I got very addicted to this. A very long time ago. Dude the Roblox stream was funny as fuck.

6
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:49,129
I mean, I just had a good time. I appreciate that you think that though. It was a lot of fun.

7
00:01:53,099 --> 00:02:06,299
And that's all that matters at the end of the day. Do I know who Hunk is? I do. Don't spoil it.

8
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:35,689
Oh I forgot to tweet. There we go. You're gonna have to be a full-time Roblox streamer. I feel

9
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:43,080
like Roblox is kind of a... I feel like that's a really easy way to be able to hit up other

10
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:49,219
streamers and just go, hey do you want to just do this for a few hours? Because one of the things

11
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:56,259
that's actually kind of difficult streaming is that there's so many people to reach out to or

12
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,819
talk to or whatever and it's like, oh what about you? Do you want to do something? Maybe I'll do

13
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:04,759
something with you. And it's like, oh what do you want to do? And it's like, oh fuck. What do we want

14
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:10,680
to do? I think that's a very simple thing just to be like, let's go ride roller coasters and Roblox

15
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:22,039
for an hour. I think that's just easy. It's just easy to like put that line out, right? Good title?

16
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:40,550
Well I didn't make it so don't give me the credit. It's simple and fun. I mean it's,

17
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:47,020
it is whatever you decide to make it I guess. There's a lot of stuff on Roblox from what I've

18
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:54,120
been told and I don't know a lot of it is probably not very good. There's probably a ton of really

19
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,300
just, there's a lot of really really good things. There's probably a lot of really bad things too.

20
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:07,979
I don't know anything about it. Why are you a hater? I don't know. I'm just saying. I don't

21
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:13,379
know. There could be a lot of things that aren't very good. Is that why people have opinions on it?

22
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:20,439
I don't know. I don't know anything about it. Nice centrist take. That's how you walk it back

23
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:33,930
real quick. No I genuinely don't know. My only experience with Roblox was two and a half hours

24
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:42,730
two days ago. I don't know anything about the platform at all but I had a lot of fun. I thought

25
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:47,500
it was, I thought it was a really enjoyable experience so I'm probably gonna do more.

26
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:55,670
Play with Ludwig. I gotta hit Ludwig up. We wanted to do something like weeks ago.

27
00:04:56,389 --> 00:05:04,569
Just kind of fell off the plate. See what he's up to over the next couple weeks.

28
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:20,860
Nobody said more with a bunch of question marks. I don't know. We'll see. Who knows what's gonna

29
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:36,180
happen. You would like Ludwig? Hmm. Maybe I'll check him out. But yeah I was gonna chill tonight.

30
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:42,259
It's gonna be one of those of many more slowed down just kind of chill relaxed streams that I

31
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:49,800
talked about back in January. Just gonna play Mercenaries. Hang out. Chill. And that's all

32
00:05:49,800 --> 00:06:01,610
there is to it. Chill on a horror game? Mercenaries is not really a horror game. Mercenaries is more

33
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:10,310
of a shooter game. Mercenaries is a wave shooting game mode that they put into Resident Evil 4.

34
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:26,300
So it's not really scary. It's just kind of fun. But let's do it. It's all jump scares over and

35
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:33,180
over again. Oh by the way I put like a I put a warning on the VOD. On the last VOD. I was

36
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:38,139
considering like doing a highlight to remove that really bad jump scare part but hopefully a warning

37
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:48,459
in the VOD is enough. Hopefully people saw it. It was a good warning. Okay. No no I'm not gonna

38
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:53,939
remove that. No no I was just making sure it was enough that people saw it. I'm not gonna remove

39
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:59,319
the VOD. I was gonna highlight the part of that out. But then it was gonna be kind of jarring. I

40
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:17,430
figured I figured a warning's probably enough. Don't you dare. The whole point of a jump scare

41
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:25,579
is that there's no warning. Uh I think a jump scare when you know a jump scare is possible

42
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:44,899
is different than when it just like attacks you out of nowhere for no reason. All right.

43
00:07:44,899 --> 00:08:00,009
You guys ready? How did stir do that? That was my favorite part of the entire stream

44
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:06,120
a couple days ago was the incredible detective work that I did in one second

45
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,569
to accuse stir of doing that. There's so many layers as to how that happened. It's just

46
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:20,180
if you watch that whole segment that whole five minutes before that segment

47
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:27,420
that whole thing and like a minute or two after that it's just everything in my brain was you

48
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:37,980
could even see I'm like oh you you you did that you piece of shit it was it was just the way that

49
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:45,980
like the turn turn up the volume on stir's uh stir's discord to hey dude he's quiet he's quiet

50
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:52,629
dude stir even screams right before I turn him up he go I'm like oh stir's quiet he goes

51
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:57,750
and then it goes so it's like holy shit there's no way you didn't do that

52
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:07,049
and then he laughs he like laughs at it is so unbelievable just how much I could have

53
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:12,409
I thought it was him it's so so funny like just how I thought that I mean the jumps get sucked

54
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:17,610
and obviously I hope that that's not something I ever want to have to show anybody

55
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:24,259
unprompted but the whole thing leading up to that and after that of my accusal

56
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:37,779
of stir I think is my favorite part so far wrap it up Albertson hey you need to apologize

57
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:53,509
I did all right you guys ready let's just play here it is so I think you have to unlock stuff

58
00:09:54,149 --> 00:10:00,889
yeah okay so you gotta unlock stuff so I'm gonna do village first obviously we have four characters

59
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:10,919
there's Leon I wonder who else is even in this because I know that I don't want to say anything

60
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:18,169
what if you've never seen this is this battle royale it is not they they give you more stuff

61
00:10:18,169 --> 00:10:36,090
this time don't they okay well I know who these are this is uh Lewis what's this guy's name

62
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,029
so there's the um

63
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:51,029
Lewis this is hunk what I what I can't I can't think of this guy's name why not Kramer

64
00:10:52,389 --> 00:11:00,860
Krauser yeah Krauser Krauser Lewis all right let's go so how this works is you just kind of

65
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:09,269
shoot run around and pick up stuff you get a time limit defeat as many enemies as possible

66
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:12,470
within the time limit taking them out in quick stitch mode from a combo they'll earn you points

67
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:16,820
yeah you want to keep a combo together so we're just gonna get the swing of it again

68
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:31,559
it's been a while you get seconds added all right you also want to make sure you keep combos don't

69
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:46,570
kill everybody because you might run out of people to kill oops where are they I remember back in the

70
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:53,340
day getting a I think it was like more it was an insane combo I forget what I used to be able to

71
00:11:53,340 --> 00:12:11,620
get what is mayhem mode what is going on you can go it's like extra fast attack speed and more time

72
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:20,940
so you build up the mayhem meter oh wait add this power up still I think no don't lose the

73
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:32,679
combo no good okay we're good I don't even think about it where's the barrel there's a barrel here

74
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:43,289
somewhere right here all right get some people to come through here and I'm gonna blow this up

75
00:12:43,929 --> 00:13:08,259
shoot the barrel we're good we're good oh all right mayhem mode go oh I'm kind of lagging

76
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:33,929
oh shit I'm out of bullets all right big enemy coming oh my god I didn't see him oh my god

so I have a question if the time runs out versus dying if I die it's over right

139
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:30,500
or do I still get the point it's the same thing all right I'm actually not as concerned though

140
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:43,740
those guys gotta die and I don't even know where they are nice I gotta run where are they where's

141
00:32:43,740 --> 00:33:16,660
it coming from right there oh shit that's bad throwing up throw throw throw throw yeah I think

142
00:33:16,819 --> 00:33:35,910
I'm going I'm going nuts today I'm gonna lose the combo sorry kill the catapults yep move move

143
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:42,220
move where is it where's the barrel this shit's not even heated I don't even know where it is

144
00:33:42,779 --> 00:34:03,210
all right I'm gonna try to go up go use the cannon oh wait more heals good I'm going for the one

145
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:11,860
million here I'm definitely going for one million I guess we're good spot all right there's the

146
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:28,179
cannon I killed everybody everybody's just dead where is that what wait oh I killed everybody

147
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:45,159
I killed everybody what holy shit I'm running around looking for to get to the next position

148
00:34:45,159 --> 00:35:05,369
but I killed every single enemy damn oh I got Krauser and the island where's your score

149
00:35:06,309 --> 00:35:26,230
yeah let's go that's pretty good all right what is um let's Krauser oh Krauser has the oh that's

150
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:33,849
right I want a bunch of oh and a machine gun I feel like I'm not going to be very good with

151
00:35:33,849 --> 00:35:52,230
this character that's right he's got the uh the Las Plagas arm right okay during mayhem mode he

152
00:35:52,230 --> 00:36:07,110
mutates and can deal close quarters attacks with left with rust with both that seems amazing I

153
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:13,179
think this one so far is my favorite all right let's try this I feel like I'm going to do pretty

154
00:36:13,179 --> 00:36:25,050
bad here let's see so this is explosive arrows I only get three shots with that I don't think

155
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:37,269
I want to do that okay let's go I'm really not a big submachine gun fan in any of these games

156
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,079
as you've seen through through the first playthrough you saw here

157
00:36:42,440 --> 00:37:04,309

160
00:37:55,219 --> 00:38:01,960

161
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:18,260
I'm gonna lose the combo combo is I did that just to keep the combo I thought he was dead

218
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:54,730
I hear it I hear them I hear them I hear them where are they holy shit they're right here

00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:51,800
I'm so dead seven I need seven I don't care if it hurts me oh that's all right fuck oh I was so

221
00:58:51,800 --> 00:59:06,730
close I just freaked out shit sorry if I had to do that I thought okay I thought the chainsaw person

222
00:59:07,449 --> 00:59:15,219
was right behind me swinging so I just tried to get as many kills as possible in the last second

223
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:33,239
I thought I was dead you threw two grenades at your feet well because if I threw if I threw it

224
00:59:33,239 --> 00:59:38,280
any further I thought I was gonna just overshoot everybody so right there I knew I in my mind

225
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:42,840
I'm dead I was just going for points because I was like I'm dead here no matter what

226
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:59,880
that was fun though cool hey I'm happy with every single attempt has been an S

227
01:00:01,179 --> 01:00:16,630
I'm happy or S plus I'm okay with that I want to take hunk to let me try that again what happens

228
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:26,170
if you S plus everything I don't know I've never done it I don't think I even S'd every level in

229
01:00:26,170 --> 01:00:38,809
the last time I played this like in the original game where do I go to kind of remember where the

230
01:00:38,809 --> 01:00:47,369
layout is here how do I go up there's a very specific ladder to go up all right let me get

231
01:00:47,369 --> 01:00:59,349
all the let me try a new strategy here S plus plus is the highest dude really I don't think

232
01:00:59,349 --> 01:01:06,969
you should even shoot anything until you get all the bonuses try that strategy just hide somewhere

233
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:28,619
where where are all the greens I'm kind of wasting time uh restart it where are the greens I guess

234
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:38,250
it's good to kind of memorize that this is a uh this is a who cares run there's one in here

235
01:01:39,909 --> 01:01:55,940
oh they it's random uh okay they move around well never mind let's just play you may lay a

236
01:01:55,940 --> 01:02:02,039
crouch down staggered enemy with hunk oh I'm always so afraid to get in close to do a melee

237
01:02:02,039 --> 01:02:06,360
on the big scary enemies I always feel like I'm gonna screw it up and they're gonna kill me in

238
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:38,489
one hit try to go let's see if I hold on I'm gonna try this um you grabbed me instead of whatever

239
01:02:38,489 --> 01:03:20,039

243
01:04:39,769 --> 01:04:54,460
even more than that all right go go go go go go go go is that an instant kill

244
01:04:55,099 --> 01:05:05,769

bonuses until I really actually until like maybe a minute yeah where's Ada wasn't Ada in this

356

428
02:08:58,489 --> 02:09:03,060
I mean I would I would say it's more like bail from Diablo 2 you just put all right put some

429
02:09:03,060 --> 02:09:08,100
filters on that put some echo on it and some kind of grunge on it and that will be when you stand

430
02:09:08,100 --> 02:09:23,590
still in the uh the what the world sanctuary wherever it is and it goes like right that's

431
02:09:23,590 --> 02:09:41,699
what I would have said my brothers will not die in vain vain vain yeah here's bail's laugh okay

432
02:09:41,699 --> 02:10:10,939
let's let's see let's compare it my brothers will not have died in vain uh you know I always thought

433
02:10:10,939 --> 02:10:40,619
I was a bail you know I was gonna pick what Diablo character enough I gotta s with everybody on here

434
02:10:40,619 --> 02:10:56,680
I know everyone's saying dude um excuse me Leon's not my character somebody wanted to see hunk again

435
02:10:58,279 --> 02:11:10,550
uh we'll play hunk here what am I gonna do after this um I don't know I kind of just

436
02:11:10,550 --> 02:11:15,140
planned on playing whatever I didn't this wasn't gonna be like a super duper long long stream or

437
02:11:15,140 --> 02:11:25,020
anything I just was I'll pivot to something else maybe uh probably not breath of the wild I was

438
02:11:25,020 --> 02:11:35,220
thinking about that but my switch is not um not set up right now I played um I don't know I just

439
02:11:35,220 --> 02:11:38,979
took the switch into bed because it was well breath of the wild I was playing it that's cool

440
02:11:40,520 --> 02:11:51,289
and I kind of just started playing random switch games and one of those random games I was playing

441
02:11:51,289 --> 02:12:04,359
the Wario where uh for Game Boy Advance didn't I stream that game a while ago vampire survivors

442
02:12:04,920 --> 02:12:16,859
I played a lot of the DLC off camera so I have seen it already play some n64 games

443
02:12:17,500 --> 02:12:36,550
I'm down for that I'm gonna lose the combo do the hitman freelancer I would I promise you I would

444
02:12:36,550 --> 02:12:41,909
I just don't have hitman installed right now and that game is like 700 million gigabytes and I don't

445
02:12:41,909 --> 02:12:45,829
really I think I can really install it on stream I probably could but it would take like 20 minutes

446
02:12:45,829 --> 02:13:01,189
or so 30 minutes that one down I wonder can you turn off the power or do you just store it

447
02:13:15,060 --> 02:13:36,779
crew crew um maybe hmm maybe someone's probably gonna drop behind me

448
02:13:37,500 --> 02:14:14,170
oh we're good nobody spawned I need to break some more necks okay let me get this actually

449
02:14:15,289 --> 02:14:32,890
let's just do it again why not come on what's with the stun lock there we go all right I got

450
02:14:32,890 --> 02:14:50,140
plenty of time I don't need time anymore oh shit just deal with that what about dos

451
02:14:52,420 --> 02:14:59,689
hmm after uh after I do this one we'll take a look what we have for options

452
02:14:59,689 --> 02:15:14,329
there's something else like an hour or two where are you there you are break his neck I actually

453
02:15:14,329 --> 02:15:54,470
don't mind being down here easy don't even fall Nelson right now please collect and then I'm

454
02:15:54,470 --> 02:16:22,090

455
02:16:22,090 --> 02:16:30,180
shit those things kill you instantly yes they do I may have just blown it I completely forgot

456
02:16:30,180 --> 02:16:50,040
those things kill you instantly I'm good all right crisis absolutely averted right there I'm

457
02:16:50,040 --> 02:17:22,059

458
02:17:22,059 --> 02:17:49,180
where are the others where are the others I didn't want to use this for no reason okay

459
02:17:49,180 --> 02:18:03,459
it's done it's the last one there's one more person I don't know oh they did it did it

460
02:18:10,680 --> 02:18:28,940
shit oops good all right I think I'm gonna stick right here till the end I'll have mayhem mode

461
02:18:29,659 --> 02:18:43,129
I might be able to actually get 150 this is actually a big deal hold on I got really scared

462
02:18:43,129 --> 02:19:20,950
there that's my own fault all right here we go oh shit oh this is the one this is the one this is

463
02:19:20,950 --> 02:20:15,000
the one come on I did it where's the last enemy where's the last enemy oh oh my god yes holy

464
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:23,750
shit oh I did it oh that's thank god oh my god I thought I was gonna miss it big time right there

465
02:20:23,750 --> 02:20:36,620
at the end there it is nice youtuber reaction that was real that made it may have sounded fake

466
02:20:37,340 --> 02:20:40,709
that was genuine I was about to get really really sad

467
02:20:41,510 --> 02:21:12,790
can I register my name yeah it's thinking 1.1 mil 1.1 mil 1.1 million does anybody know what

468
02:21:12,790 --> 02:21:32,680
the maximum score is check the leaderboards dude I'm the 10,611th best gamer in the world

469
02:21:34,729 --> 02:21:51,899
on island with hunk in Resident Evil 4 remake why am I on there twice that's funny 10

470
02:21:55,930 --> 02:22:03,700
you know what's really kind of wild about this that was hard that was like really challenging

471
02:22:03,700 --> 02:22:09,139
really hard there are so many people that are so good at this shit it's unbelievable

472
02:22:09,780 --> 02:22:20,790
well I don't know if I'm gonna do much better than that look at number one

473
02:22:25,420 --> 02:22:45,459
a village how do I go by ranking how do I sort it tab so 2.5 million is the highest you can

474
02:22:45,459 --> 02:23:02,139
possibly get that's probably everywhere 2.5 million 2.5 million 2.5 million it's all leons too

475
02:23:02,860 --> 02:23:17,079
probably because the point multiplier for leon it's crazy what s plus plus does so all of my

476
02:23:17,079 --> 02:23:25,100
s pluses are like oh I think I think I did a pretty good job 46,000 but if you get an s plus plus you

477
02:23:25,100 --> 02:23:36,899
almost instantly teleport up to like the top 10,000 that's kind of interesting so what's the

478
02:23:36,899 --> 02:23:46,549
next layer then I guess let's see looks like 1.1 seems to be the highest to get out of here I wonder

479
02:23:48,069 --> 02:23:57,340
let's go here let's do start at one so at what point does this become like most people are not

480
02:23:57,340 --> 02:24:03,930
doing more than 2 million 2.1 seems to be a pretty hard cut off because then you got half a million

481
02:24:03,930 --> 02:24:12,600
points that are only like seven slots that looks like two millions doable somewhere between 1.5 to

482
02:24:12,600 --> 02:24:28,059
two is pretty doable it seems and these aren't even with full combos yeah seems like 1.5 1.5

483
02:24:28,059 --> 02:24:36,760
is where all the the god gamers live that's definitely the case cool all right I'm going

484
02:24:36,760 --> 02:24:42,780
to take a quick break that was really fun this was resident evil 4 remakes mercenaries mode

485
02:24:44,500 --> 02:24:52,549
I heavily enjoyed it uh well I'll play something else for a little bit we'll figure it out when I

486
02:24:52,549 --> 02:24:58,260
get back I'll take a look I'm gonna go pee I'm gonna get a drink and I'll see you guys in like

487
02:24:58,819 --> 02:25:01,420
a few minutes five minutes maybe see you in a minute

488
02:25:56,149 --> 02:26:12,979
oh my mic is still on you I'm just looking at my steam hot bike hot bike you know what's funny

489
02:26:12,979 --> 02:26:21,299
anytime I go brb even if I know the mic is muted I don't do I don't talk until I'm out of the room

490
02:26:21,299 --> 02:26:26,700
like if I have to burp or fart or something really bad I even if I mute it over here

491
02:26:26,700 --> 02:26:33,299
I'm doing I'm not doing that till I'm out of the room I just don't sometimes I just don't trust it

492
02:26:33,299 --> 02:26:54,579
I don't know but I'll uh all right I'm looking at my steam we heard it paranoid Perry well

493
02:26:55,219 --> 02:27:03,479
let me tell you something if I'm not paranoid Perry and for some reason I'm sitting here

494
02:27:04,299 --> 02:27:12,340
and I've ripped ass really really loud with a brb screen up you that you want to talk about a

495
02:27:12,340 --> 02:27:20,379
clip that will be shared a hundred thousand times forever you guys you guys will link that to me

496
02:27:20,379 --> 02:27:25,739
