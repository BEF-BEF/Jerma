1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:20,100
Hello, welcome. How are you? You doing good? So sorry for the abrupt ending last night.

2
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:28,620
We may get another one. I don't know. It's really kind of up in the air at this point.

3
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:36,579
So around like seven to eight o'clock, maybe earlier Pacific, we might just go,

4
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:45,450
I don't know. We're gonna do what we can. In the meantime, if you're wondering what we're doing

5
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:56,100
tonight, we're continuing the FMV game catalog. There are still plenty to go through. Some of

6
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,619
these are extra crusty, and by extra crusty I mean they might just stop working halfway through.

7
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:12,409
Some of these are so crunchy that we might not be able to see past the menu on some of them.

8
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:21,030
I don't know. I've tried to test as many of them as I could, but sometimes you get the

9
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:28,599
cheese stuffed crust. So not only is there crust, there's cheese in there too, which sometimes

10
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:35,219
that's a good thing. But we're gonna start with Ripper. Ripper is a game that has been

11
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:46,650
requested a few times. Christopher Walken is in this game. Am I gonna beat Dragon's Lair 2? I did.

12
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:54,250
I beat Dragon's Lair 2. The final image from last night's stream was me pointing at the screen

13
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:01,180
for about five seconds before the internet turned off. The game telling me, congratulations,

14
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:08,810
you made it to the end, but you failed because you didn't get any treasures. So I did complete it,

15
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:19,379
though. I ain't doing that shit again. And we have that Kingdom game has a sequel. I have that too.

16
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:35,539
I would put your seatbelt on for this one. Here we go. This is Ripper. Why don't we view the intro?

17
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:48,900
We already got a scream face. That's a good start. And you know what? No, fuck it. I'll be

18
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,580
right back. I'll be right back. Hold on. Just relax. I'll be right back. Everyone hold on.

19
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:58,740
BRB within four minutes of the stream. Be right back. Just hold on. Wait, no. Just watch this.

20
00:02:58,740 --> 00:04:06,699
I'll be right back. Hold on. Fuck it. Hold on. You know how long it took me to get these fucking

21
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:17,160
games to work? I deserve it. I deserve a fresh core is light. Yeah. I don't even I fucking hate

22
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:32,980
beer. All right, here we go. Are you ready for the intro? Oh, all right. You good? We good?

23
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:47,750
You can hear it. Good. The vod's already deleted. Great. That's fantastic. The vod's already gone.

24
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:54,120
No, wait. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I don't want to. I'm not having the mod.

25
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:02,839
The mod mod get viewed. I'm not the John Rhys Davies. You know the song.

26
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:11,720
That's all that's happening. That's what's happening right now.

27
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:32,980
I see they can't they can't get me now.

28
00:05:33,540 --> 00:06:01,110
All right, the vod is saved. No, I thought that was the end. All right.

29
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,180
Content ID can't get it.

30
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:35,370
My editor Ben Dodds called me at 3 a.m. to give me the news. It was a woman this time,

31
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:40,069
the third victim of all the reporters in the city. The ripper picked me to write to fix

32
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:44,790
the screen. Another mad letter to the city was soon to come and I would run it on the

33
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:51,189
front page of the virtual Herald. I would let the world know the ripper had killed again.

34
00:06:51,189 --> 00:07:05,300
The Ripper Jack the Ripper. Oh, god damn it. Okay. Yeah, we got it. Oh, wait, that's right.

35
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:16,379
What's wrong with the screen? It's still 400 by 300 screens down because that's when I full

36
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:21,740
screen. Wait, what's it doing? Well, it's fixed because I went out of full screen. What's it

37
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:32,629
doing? Can we give you like an exact explanation of what's happening? It's cropping it. Hold on.

38
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:40,230
Let me see. Can I get a good look? I see what's happening. I see what's happening. Hold on. Okay,

39
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:49,370
hold on a second. I see what's happening here. Hold on. So I gotta move it up. I can look at it.

40
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:58,870
I can see it right now. Look at that. Okay, hold on. I got it. The game may have crashed,

41
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:08,009
but it's okay. This is gonna be this is gonna be close enough. I told you this is gonna be

42
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:13,860
fucking crunchy. Some of you didn't believe me. Like, what do you mean crunchy? What's that even

43
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:25,939
mean? I love like crunchy candy. No, you know, are you sure about that? All right, that's as good as

44
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:37,940
it's gonna get. Let's go. Here we go. Start a new game. That should fix it. We're good. We got it.

45
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:58,179
All right, start new game. Oh, for the love of fucking god. Can I skip this? It's louder this

46
00:08:58,179 --> 00:09:08,460
time. What if I click? Hold on. I'm gonna click. No. What about here? It's space. I think I crashed

47
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:21,299
it. No, that's pause. Hold on. Hey, how you doing? I hope you haven't eaten yet, Quinlan. What?

48
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,720
Figured you'd get here sooner or later, Quinlan. You can't get enough of this story.

49
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:38,940
I think everyone's had enough of this story, Magnata. Okay, here we go. So there's been a

50
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:45,500
there's been a murder. There's Christopher Walken, right? Yeah, Christopher Walken's in this game.

51
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:59,269
Let's go ahead and go in here. This is a porn game. It is not. There is the man himself.

52
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:08,409
Let's get some dialogue. Don't go taking any souvenirs, Quinlan. Okay, ask about the modus

53
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:14,100
operandi. Ask about the victim. Ask if Magnata has any clues. What's his name? Magnata? Do you

54
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,460
have any clues? You have any clues? No sign of Force Sanfri. Nothing's disturbed. Two sets of

55
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:24,500
prints. Hers and a mother's. It's him. The only thing not where it should be is this woman's

56
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,500
insights. But what about witnesses? I mean, this guy must have been a bloody mess. Even if it's

57
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,100
three o'clock in the morning, it's Greenwich Village. Somebody must have seen him. As far

58
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,740
as I know, he left us with one witness and she's feeling a little fragmented at the moment.

59
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:45,350
This guy is unfucking believable. Who's the swears in this game? Wow. Okay, why is the computer

60
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:49,509
still on? Why is her computer on, Magnata? Well, it looks like she was in a public library node.

61
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:55,590
Well, let me ask you a question. You got any mail lately? Maybe a little something from your pen pal?

62
00:10:56,309 --> 00:11:01,350
He writes after the fact, not before. You should know that, Magnata. I wouldn't hold out on you.

63
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:07,269
Of course not. Who's my pen pal? About sharing what you know with me and several million other

64
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:11,669
people. I should have busted you when you ran that first letter without letting us know about it.

65
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:21,350
What? Who's the letter? The murderer's letter? The game is a little quiet. I'll take care of that.

66
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:29,509
Just hold on. I'll take care of that. Hold on a second. If I alt tab, the whole thing goes

67
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:42,440
down, I think. Hold on. Hold on. All right, I got it up. Everybody relax. Are we good? I think we're

68
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:52,980
good. Excuse me? Thank you. Okay, what about the victim? Who's the victim? Name's Stein,

69
00:11:52,980 --> 00:12:00,340
Rene Stein, age 43, book editor over at Knopf. Any connection to the other two? Oh, let's see.

70
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:06,179
Estevez was a programmer, Mandela a dry cleaner. It'll take me 48 hours to run it down, but there's

71
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:15,110
no connection here. This guy has my hair. All right, what about the modus operandi? No, he doesn't. Same

72
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:20,309
MO as the others? You got it. Look around you, asshole. If anything, this is more gruesome than

73
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:26,070
the other two. Hell of a lot more splatter. Look around you, asshole. All right, visiting

74
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:30,789
hours over. There's nothing here you haven't seen at the other murder sites except a few extra

75
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:34,230
gallons of body fluids. Well, you shouldn't be touching anything, should you, Magnata?

76
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:44,250
Hey. I guess this case has me rattled. Were you drinking out of the coffee cup?

77
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:53,909
Why would you drink out of that coffee cup? What if there's like blood in it? All right, what about

78
00:12:53,909 --> 00:13:00,820
in the fridge? No, wait. All right, put it in the computer. Object scanned into database. Uh, that

79
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:07,029
don't look right. That didn't look right at all. That looked a little, a little, a little strange.

80
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:12,629
All right, uh, object has been scanned into the database. That's, uh, anything else I can do.

81
00:13:13,429 --> 00:13:26,679
Should I take a look at the blood? Or the computer? Filter. Sharpen. File edit. Images?

82
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:39,450
Deck port interface. Tristec agerware installed. What other? Can I press any buttons? I guess not.

83
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:49,980
Oh, this, what's this guy doing? Oh, he's got a camcorder. I was like, what is this guy doing?

84
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,820
But I don't know why I thought that was a microscope. I have no idea. Don't ask me why.

85
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:12,889
Cold Carl Stasiak. We gotta stop eating like this. Carl. Sorry, Quinlan. What'd you say? Uh, any

86
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:16,809
difference between the murder and the previous two? Ask him if any frogs is invaded in the

87
00:14:16,809 --> 00:14:22,149
investigation. If he has any idea what weapon, what kind of weapon is the ripper using? Any idea

88
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:27,830
what weapon he's using? Take a look at this mess. Has to be something big. Sword or machete or

89
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:33,110
something. Just can't cut through all that bone and muscle with a dagger. And the strength it

90
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:39,590
would take to make a cut like that. He must be an enormous man. You know, yeah, the pathologist

91
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:44,389
over at the metacock. You know, it's a lot more about murder weapons than I do. You should talk

92
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:49,830
to him and talk to the guy at the, uh, okay. What about the, the, any differences in the murders?

93
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:54,549
Is there any difference between this murder and the previous ones? It's identical. Absolutely

94
00:14:54,549 --> 00:15:01,690
identical. It was a precision cut, a perfect line. The way he empties out the body cavity,

95
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:07,690
the way the organs are blown all around the room. So it's the same killer? Oh, for sure. I mean,

96
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:11,769
the organs completely cut the pieces. I never seen anything like this in my life. Just screams

97
00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:19,049
wardrobe department. It's amazing. Any clues to how it's done? Don't ask me. You think I'd be used

98
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:29,259
to seeing things like this by now, but I'm not. Whoever did this is beyond madness. It's pure evil.

99
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:36,789
Pure evil. Okay. Any progress? Any other progress? Any progress? All of our mass effect dialogue

100
00:15:36,789 --> 00:15:42,549
options. Who knows? Trying to get anything out of Magnata is next to impossible. Besides, if he does

101
00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:48,070
have a lead, you sure as hell never share it. You might lose his bounty if he does that. Well, you've

102
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:51,990
been working with Magnata for years, Carl. What's your hunch? There's too many clues. Well, something's

103
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:57,669
bugging him. Who am I to talk? I'm having nightmares about this. The main character's doing a t-shirt

104
00:15:57,669 --> 00:16:04,549
challenge. 22 years and nothing's ever got to me like this. Now I can't sleep. No, you just need a

105
00:16:04,549 --> 00:16:10,629
vacation. That's all. Yeah. I hope you're right. Incoming whack transmission. Incoming whack

106
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:19,289
transmission. Quinlan here. Hey, Catherine. All right, whatever. Hey, Jake, how are things there?

107
00:16:20,169 --> 00:16:25,850
Well, it's very... Oh, this shit is pretty whack. You're right. Just the name, Catherine. Listen,

108
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:29,850
Jake, something's come up here. Something about the ripper? Might be nothing. I don't know. It

109
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:33,450
could be something big. Just wait for me at the newsroom and I'll let you know as soon as I find

110
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:38,490
out. The newsroom? No, talk to me. What's going on? I have to go. Trust me. Who's in charge here?

111
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:44,629
Well, after last night I say that I am. So all of a sudden you don't have to explain yourself to me?

112
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,789
Look, if you don't hear from me in an hour, just go to my apartment and wait for me there.

113
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:55,750
You can hang out with my crystals. Catherine. My crystals? Shit. Really hang out with your

114
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:11,019
crystals. Should I save the game? All right. Save game in this slot. Got it. Save. I will forget

115
00:17:11,019 --> 00:17:17,190
that now. Fuck it up. All right. So let's go. So we're going to go hang out with the... Is that

116
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:30,180
another word for like cats or something? Newsroom. All right. Oh, here we go. What's going on, Ben?

117
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:34,980
Did Catherine get a break in the ripper story? I don't know, Jake. I thought you were the lead

118
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:40,019
reporter in the story. Well, so did I. Do you know what she's up to? This is chattel. Your assistant.

119
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:45,859
You tell me. She ran out of here like the place was on fire. Did another letter from the ripper

120
00:17:45,859 --> 00:17:51,720
come in? No, you know he doesn't send them to anybody but you. Isn't you... I guess we're just

121
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:58,039
going to have to wait and see. Just tell me. Catherine and I met on the job. Despite reminding

122
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:03,319
myself that mixing love and work can get messy, it didn't take long for it to become more than a

123
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:07,640
professional relationship. I love all the fake stuff. You're not even typing on a real keyboard.

124
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:13,160
But she was beginning to act like it was her story. I only hope that whatever lead she had,

125
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,920
she wasn't in. That's how I type. That's the way I type. See? Incoming WAC transmission.

126
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:30,250
Dear boss, have you seen my work this morning yet? Your stories make the cop seem so confident.

127
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:37,450
None of you know how I do it. You never will. You shouldn't let your girlfriend do your work for you.

128
00:18:38,329 --> 00:18:49,210
She is close to me and are not laughing. She's my next job. She gets it today.

129
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:59,369
The story's all yours. It was truly written. It's Bugleberry. Catherine. What was he looking at?

130
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:04,839
Where are you going? That was a cigarette holder. Usually it takes an hour to cross that part of

131
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:09,960
Manhattan. I did it in 20 minutes, propelled by kicking myself in the ass for letting Catherine

132
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,400
go out alone. I was scared as hell when I got there, but everything looked okay in her apartment

133
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:22,119
until Catherine showed up, that is. Catherine, what is going on here? This is her apartment?

134
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:29,079
Where is this? What's with this Dracula apartment? What is wrong? What happened? She's been stabbed.

135
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:36,039
What? No, no, no, Catherine. Catherine, no. Catherine, no. Catherine, please, Catherine.

136
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:47,190
Fuck! What? Hold on, wait, why is this so, why did we get another one? Good news was Catherine wasn't

137
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:53,000
dead. The bad news was that she was in a coma deeper than anyone thought possible. What happened?

138
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,960
The ever-helpful Detective Magnata had her brought to the Tribeca Center for Cyber Studies,

139
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:03,160
also known as the MEDICOG. Meanwhile, I stopped off at the police station to see a few sources

140
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,720
and try to retrieve Catherine's portable whack. She'll have left me a message.

141
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:16,869
All right, so we're gonna, she's in a coma. Yeah, but why, why did she go into a coma?

142
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:29,799
All right, we're looking for the portable whack device. Looks like we're gonna talk to this guy.

143
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:44,490
Finish this game or riot? Um, we'll see. We'll see, because once we get to like the second or

144
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:58,440
third disc change I have to do, good luck. I've got him. That shit's gonna work. Who's that?

145
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:07,190
Hey, Quinlan. The Ripper Strikes Again. I guess we'll be seeing your work on the front page again.

146
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:11,269
Another body and another byline. You know, if you just catch this- This guy also has other things.

147
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:16,680
I could go back to writing the police plotter on page 12. Sorry to hear about your partner.

148
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:22,039
What is that? She was a nice girl. I liked her when she came around here. She used to come down here?

149
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:27,849
Came down here all the time. She used to do your leg work. Right, right. I just-

150
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:35,369
Was it the same guy? I can't do everything, can I? All right, any clues? I need,

151
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:44,059
I need the whack device. What about Magnata? I'll tell you, Lou, Magnata wasn't all two together

152
00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:50,619
at the murder site. It's lucky for you. No, I'm serious. There was this one strange thing.

153
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:57,980
Strange? Yeah, I mean, if I didn't know any better, I'd say that he intentionally

154
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:04,220
destroyed a piece of evidence. It won't be the first time. What? Well, he's done it before.

155
00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:10,299
Yeah, he hides it, he destroys it, he withholds it, you name it. And this is common knowledge.

156
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:14,299
Yeah, he's like king shit at a bounty collecting and the chief gets a piece of it.

157
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:22,490
I mean, what are you gonna do? You know how this place works. Really? Okay. I think it's time

158
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:29,339
to clean up the department. Any, any clues from the library? What about the library?

159
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:35,740
That was the last place that I was seen alive. Standard operating procedures to copy all libraries.

160
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:43,799
C-space files, that kind of stuff. Well, how can I get my hands on what they found?

161
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:50,500
Hell, Quinlan, it's a public library. We just copied the files. Everything's still there. What?

162
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:57,980
What? Okay, we gotta go to the library. Forensics come up with anything yet?

163
00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:03,900
Apparently, this pathologist over at the, the metacog, he's come up with this theory.

164
00:23:04,539 --> 00:23:08,700
He thinks that the Ripper may have been using nanomachines to do it.

165
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:15,900
No, God. Not nanomachines. Yeah. Not nanomachines.

166
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:22,180
I think it's time I bribe a photographer. Where's Stasiak?

167
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:27,589
He's in Wyoming. Oh, come on, Brandon. He's the only guy I haven't really talked to.

168
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:31,269
You never know what he might have picked up on. Yeah, well, that's the problem. He picked up on

169
00:23:31,269 --> 00:23:36,309
too much. I'm not kidding. He went to Wyoming. The case was too much for him, and he took a

170
00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:43,190
leave of absence. Okay. Stasiak, cold Carl Stasiak. Yeah, get this. After the Stein murder, his wife

171
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:49,670
calls and says Carl needed a little vacation. Carl? No, that was it. He just got up, no goodbyes,

172
00:23:49,670 --> 00:24:06,630
no nothing. He didn't even give me a call. Thanks for the info. Let's go. It's always weird when

173
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:15,190
they put the CG, and I use that term very loosely here, but when you're an actor in a world that is

174
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:21,670
created in 3D with old 3D technology, just it's so, it's weird. It's scary. Like this shit's creepy.

175
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:29,210
That old style of 3D mapping with the actors and shit. It's, it's fucking bizarre.

176
00:24:30,089 --> 00:24:45,990
What's over here? Yeah, it's a, it's a mist. Detective Vincent, there it is. Okay, Magnato.

177
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:53,509
Why do we have offices like this? Where are we? What year is it supposed to be?

178
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:06,890
I don't, I don't get it. It's 2040. It said the year. Well, that's too busy fucking muting VODs.

179
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:18,170
Fucking hey, cigars. The man's got taste. I'll give him that. Can I take one? Anything else down

180
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:27,589
here? Oh, hold on. I can open it by my, my whack device. Object scanned into database.

181
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:37,990
What is it? Uh, arrest report. I can't read this. Violation of city penal code detective,

182
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:44,069
arresting officer detective Vincent Magnato. Corpus observed at 1 45 a.m. at the corner of

183
00:25:44,069 --> 00:25:51,819
Washington. It was a discharging submitter, but I had a taser to disable two members of this

184
00:25:51,819 --> 00:26:01,099
spreading zugs. A rage gang captain from 40 feet with a sleeper bullet and called for a cleanup.

185
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:12,920
All right. Well, I got it scanned, so let's see if it's bullshit. Can I go on his computer? I don't

186
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:19,990
think so. Let's get out of here. It's going to be standing right there, sitting on the couch.

187
00:26:20,869 --> 00:26:44,630
Give me the fuck out of this. Wasn't I supposed to find her whack device? Can I go? Can I go

188
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:58,900
anywhere else? Wait, what about this way? What is down there? Over there? Please stop the bongos.

189
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:10,170
I can't. They can't be stopped. Go over here. I'm just spinning around. Uh, I want to go in this room.

190
00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:15,750
Is this the evidence chamber? Fucking stop them. I can't stop them.

191
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:20,950
There I cannot deter. I can't turn the bongos off evidence room. Here we are.

192
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:32,500
Welcome to the evidence chamber. What can I help you with, buddy? Oh crap. What do you want?

193
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:36,339
Some respect, Spankowski. You know, you really shouldn't talk to me like that.

194
00:27:36,339 --> 00:27:41,299
I shouldn't be talking to you at all, you goddamn leech. What do you want? Some of us got to work

195
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:48,549
for a living. Right. I want to see evidence from the Catherine Powell case, please. I need the

196
00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:54,819
evidence in the Powell case. No way, Quinlan. That could be my job. All right, time to convince.

197
00:27:55,539 --> 00:28:00,650
Bluff them. Tell them Magnata said it's all right to see the evidence. Let's go with the bluff.

198
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:04,329
Let's see, can I get him with my... do I have enough charisma to do this? I need the evidence

199
00:28:04,329 --> 00:28:09,450
in the Powell case. Spankowski, what are you worried about? Magnata okayed it. Get the hell

200
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:13,369
out of here, Quinlan. Magnata would never let a civilian see evidence. He doesn't even like it

201
00:28:13,369 --> 00:28:24,150
when they're in the building. Uh oh. Didn't work. Didn't work. Not good. Look, Quinlan. I told you

202
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:26,710
everything I know. Now will you get the hell out of here before you get me in trouble?

203
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:33,269
Look, Quinlan. I told you everything I know. Now will you get the hell out of here before you get

204
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:40,759
me in trouble? I still don't understand the thing around that necks. I obviously need to

205
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:50,940
find a way to convince him to give me the evidence. Let's go. Let's go. That's a police badge.

206
00:28:52,539 --> 00:29:09,880
All right, let's see if I... did I unlock any new areas? What about that way? Turn the music off?

207
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:17,589
No, I'm not going to turn the music off. You'll be fine. There we go. Police station. Try pick a

208
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:26,069
center. All right. Catherine Powell's apartment newsroom. Let's go to... uh, I was supposed to

209
00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:31,339
meet somebody at the newsroom, right? Let's go. Oh, shit!

210
00:29:48,410 --> 00:30:01,380
Well, it looks like we're never going to go to... we're never going to go to the newsroom.

211
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:14,869
Metacog, uh-huh, hold on. Metacog, uh-huh, hold on. Metacog, hold on. Metacog, hold on.

212
00:30:14,869 --> 00:30:19,430
I, like, brought all the footage. Oh, the... Did you pardon? I thought it was going to work.

213
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:26,170
I said, can I help you? What'd you think I said? Nothing. I... I'm looking for, uh,

214
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:30,410
whoever's taking care of my girlfriend, Catherine Powell. That would be Dr. Burton.

215
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:34,970
Take the elevator to the second floor and make a right. If she's not there, go to ICU down the

216
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:41,210
hall from there. Whatever you do, don't stand too close to her. Why's that? A little chilly.

217
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:59,299
What? Right. All right, let's just go up here. Elevator and to the right. That's a scary looking

218
00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:24,460
place. Is this a scary game? It might be. That's... I don't know. It could be. I gotta go up.

219
00:31:25,339 --> 00:31:39,079
Ward's Lobby Morgue. Let's go to the... Ward? What is going on? Oh, yeah.

220
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:48,890
Uh, that scared the shit out of me. That actually did. I thought it was, like, a scream.

221
00:31:50,809 --> 00:32:09,819
And then to the right. Is this supposed to be scary? I don't know. I can't tell.

222
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:17,369
This might be a part where it's going to be scary. There's nothing even over there.

223
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:32,940
Oh, there she is. All right, so... What are you doing here? My name's Jay Quinlan. I'm a friend

224
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:41,190
of Catherine's. Quinlan? Yeah, okay. How is Catherine? Is she going to be all right?

225
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:46,789
It doesn't look good. Her consciousness is deeply withdrawn. Where is she withdrawn? What's that

226
00:32:46,789 --> 00:32:53,190
mean? It means her mental processes, her memory, the basic building blocks of her personality are

227
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:58,950
inaccessible. You mean she's in there, but you can't reach her? That's a best case scenario.

228
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:14,779
We haven't yet diagnosed her psychic damage. How did the Ripper do this? It's hard to tell.

229
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:20,299
She had some minor contusions on her head. Nothing fatal, but you never know with head injuries.

230
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:24,539
We won't know anything until we can get a data angel in there to do some... A data angel? You

231
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:29,339
can get a data angel into the consciousness of someone in a coma? I'm not sending anyone in there

232
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:34,700
until I've had a chance to fully map her psychic damage. Let me get in there. Now, if you don't mind.

233
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:45,369
All right, well what are you doing for her? What are you doing for her? I'm not doing anything for

234
00:33:45,369 --> 00:33:49,609
her as long as I'm standing here talking to you. Why don't you let me get back to work?

235
00:33:50,809 --> 00:33:57,109
So I have to go in there on my own then? Will, is she going to be all right? It doesn't look good.

236
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:06,200
She's still in triage. We're going to just have to wait and see. Well, what do you do? Let me get in

237
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:12,360
there. Let me, can I at least see? Wait, there's another person here. You here to check on Miss

238
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:17,880
Powell? Miss Paul Giamani. She looks pretty bad. Is there anything you can do for her? She's in good

239
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:24,739
hands, and she'll be in even better hands once Dr. Burton allows us to treat her. Where's Dr.

240
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:43,300
Burtman? Let me in there. Is something I'm going to take? Is there anything else I can do in here?

241
00:34:46,579 --> 00:34:54,860
I don't think I can do anything else in this room. No, all right, that doctor. I've got to go to the

242
00:34:54,860 --> 00:35:04,139
doctor. Let's find the doctor's office. Insert disk two. I will. I'll try. I have to save the game. I'm

243
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:16,460
going to restart the game. Guys, I'm running this game through like four different virtual layers,

244
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:24,070
okay? I'm on my computer, and then from my computer to a virtual machine, from the virtual

245
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:33,179
machine to a DOS emulation, from an emulation through the disk. Sorry, I just bumped you.

246
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:51,400
And then through VPN. What is going on over here? Jump scare, jump scare, jump scare, jump scare. Do

247
00:35:51,400 --> 00:36:04,500
it. Oh, it's a wet floor. I can't go over here. No, that's what these are here for. I can't go

248
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:16,809
this way. Wait. Locked. Damn. How am I supposed to open this? I don't know. Do you have like a,

249
00:36:17,369 --> 00:36:32,340
what the fuck do you have? Remote control. I can turn the game down from in my inventory. Okay.

250
00:36:34,469 --> 00:36:41,139
I don't want to press the power button. Oh, here we go. Cool. All right. How do I, I don't want to,

251
00:36:41,139 --> 00:36:45,480
I don't want to, how do I turn? No, no, don't reset the game. Just turn this off.

252
00:36:47,179 --> 00:37:00,920
Okay. Inventory. Use. Done. All right. Save game. Right here. Overwrite. Save it. Okay.

253
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:19,670
I'm gonna turn around. There's nothing else over here. The game, this game low key sucks.

254
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:38,150
Just wait a second. We need to go to the other place. This game's low key sucks. We're gonna

255
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:52,760
go to the morgue. I'm gonna try the other disc, but not yet. We don't have to do that yet.

256
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:09,929
There we are. All right. There's combat in this game. Guys, don't you want to at least see the

257
00:38:09,929 --> 00:38:16,809
combat? Don't you want to see Kristen walking and go, well, at least one more time before we end this?

258
00:38:17,769 --> 00:38:27,000
Don't you want to see that? Don't you want to know? I kind of need to know. I have to beat this game.

259
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:36,199
There's combat. What is going on? Is it just a pair of legs? What the fuck is that?

260
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:46,920
Is it Paul Giamatti again? Hey, Vic. What's for lunch? Hey, Quinlan. Oh, what the?

261
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:55,179
They work in your heart? Workin' me like crazy these days. Hey, is this Renee Stein?

262
00:38:55,820 --> 00:39:01,900
You're kidding. You were at the crime scene. I saw her inside splattered everywhere. Yeah,

263
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:10,420
I guess I did. Yeah, this one was married to her, Ripper. Yeah, this was a businessman. We're on a

264
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:13,460
trip for three weeks. He gets paranoid that his partner's puttin' her in a car. Can you take the

265
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:16,820
cigarette out of your mouth before you talk to me, please? So he flies home early and shoots it at

266
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:35,369
that. I mean, stuff like that. That's why I never got married, you know? Low key TOS. Any luck

267
00:39:35,369 --> 00:39:39,050
figuring out the Ripper's weapon yet? What's the weapon? I'm completely stumped. Nano machine.

268
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:43,690
I did every test on these STIPS. I mean, a computer cross-matched the wounds with every

269
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:49,130
kind of blade imaginable. Nothin'. I mean, it's like a cross between a Vegematic and a diamond cutter.

270
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:51,610
What's with the thing on his head? Something must have cut these people open.

271
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:54,329
Nothing these computers can find. What's with the miner's helmet on? Now, you don't believe me?

272
00:39:54,329 --> 00:40:01,139
Look at those control panels by the STIPS. Doctors don't have those. What is that? He's got blood in

273
00:40:01,139 --> 00:40:07,460
his hands and he's, like, putting it on his mouth. You hear about my partner? Who's that? Catherine

274
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:13,059
Powell. She was attacked by the Ripper. Somehow she got away. She's upstairs in a coma. Dr. Burton's

275
00:40:13,059 --> 00:40:16,500
treating her. Oh. Oh, that's supposed to be the future. Right. Okay. Burton's a good doctor.

276
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:23,289
And if she gets stuck, she'll probably call in her secret weapon. What's that? A guy named

277
00:40:23,289 --> 00:40:32,139
Joey Falconetti. Joey Falconetti. Joey Falconetti. Okay. Who's that? Who's Joey Falconetti?

278
00:40:32,139 --> 00:40:37,500
Cyberspace expert that Burton uses on all the tough cases. Also known by his old C-space handle,

279
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:43,179
Falconetti. Get it? Crazy guy. Likes looking at the body. I'm surprised she hasn't called him in

280
00:40:43,179 --> 00:40:48,699
yet to look at your friend. What do you mean? Oh, well, he keeps doing it. Stop doing that.

281
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:52,539
She usually calls him in on that kind of stuff. All right. Now, it would have been funny if they

282
00:40:52,539 --> 00:40:57,820
had a take where he went and he put it up into his mouth and went like, and then just kept talking.

283
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:06,780
Where can I find this Falconetti? Difficult guy to find. Burton usually goes to a guy named Gamet

284
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:14,059
Nelson. He passes the time at the Café du Champ. Café du Champ. Okay. Du Champ. You can find him

285
00:41:14,059 --> 00:41:22,250
there. All right. Let's see what disk that requires. We've got new locations. Let's see if I can like

286
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:30,389
boot the second disk and like load from there. If not, then well. I tapped the nerve memory of this

287
00:41:30,389 --> 00:41:36,070
victim and fed it into the simulator so that I could reenact the attack. Million dollar piece

288
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:42,920
of hardware. And look what it gives me. Jesus. Looks like she swallowed a fucking grenade.

289
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:50,409
I, who's, who's mind are we looking at? Here's an isolation of just one of the organs from this

290
00:41:50,409 --> 00:41:56,619
body. The lines indicate the many cuts made for this body. The sheer number of cuts isn't the

291
00:41:56,619 --> 00:42:04,539
only amazing thing. Now watch this. All of those cuts happen simultaneously. Human hands can't move

292
00:42:05,179 --> 00:42:08,619
so the river is like this for every four years. He's got like powers or something.

293
00:42:09,179 --> 00:42:15,539
He's got technological powers. Notice the path of the cut. Not one centimeter offline. Like a seam

294
00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:21,059
was unknown. Not the second disk. Because humans aren't strong enough. Does that work? Does that

295
00:42:21,059 --> 00:42:27,699
can work? Will that work? No way this cut could be so neat. I'll tell you what else is weird.

296
00:42:27,699 --> 00:42:36,139
There are no traces of fabric in the world. Oh, we're good. First layer. Peel back the

297
00:42:36,219 --> 00:42:42,619
fucking onion skin. Second layer. That's where we are. That you are here. That's where the

298
00:42:42,619 --> 00:42:48,650
DOS is being implemented into the virtual machine. Layer three is mounting the disk.

299
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:59,420
The disk is layer fucking four. I'm gonna try it. Did he lose disk two? Yeah, what you guys

300
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:03,340
don't understand is I, you know, I, I, I bought this game and it only came for the first disk.

301
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:07,449
I got scammed. I'm just, you know, I'm gonna be real with you.

302
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:20,599
Yeah. Nice Shrek metaphor. What the fuck is a Shrek metaphor mean?

303
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:28,699
All right. I'm going to try it. I gotta, I got my pathing correct.

304
00:43:30,539 --> 00:43:40,309
The onions. Does he do an onion thing? I like an onion. Donkey. I like an onion.

305
00:43:41,429 --> 00:43:46,869
Got this layer. Oh, he does do that. You're right. Fuck. Whatever. All right. So when I

306
00:43:46,869 --> 00:43:53,510
ask for the disk, we mount the second disk and then we press enter and then I press okay.

307
00:43:54,150 --> 00:44:05,260
Oh, it's going to be fucking amazing. Okay. Newsroom. Okay. Hold on here.

308
00:44:07,349 --> 00:44:30,280
Let's get this correct. So newsroom. Insert disk two into drive D. I can't get back out there,

309
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:58,219
though. I can't get it. Eject it. Eject. Oh God. Hurry. Do that in this menu. Hold on. Wait,

310
00:44:58,219 --> 00:45:04,179
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. I gotta get a bigger screen here. Hold on. I'm

311
00:45:04,179 --> 00:45:13,610
gonna stay here. Quick eject it. This is where we're going to, this is how I can tell if this

312
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:28,250
is going to work. Okay. Everybody relax. Don't, nobody move. Don't fucking move. Okay. Nobody

313
00:45:28,250 --> 00:46:18,550
move. Don't move. Action. Okay. Here we go. Everybody relax. Where is it? Shit. Hold on.

314
00:46:18,550 --> 00:47:20,739
All right. Come in. Fuck. I should have got an expert to help me. Okay. Ladies and gentlemen,

315
00:47:20,739 --> 00:47:27,219
we're coming back. Here we go. Bingo. You didn't think I fucking had it in me, did you?

316
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:34,599
You didn't think I fucking had it in me. We're on disk two. You didn't think I had it in me.

317
00:47:35,480 --> 00:48:16,489
Move restore game or continue game? No. It's okay. It's okay. We're gonna.

318
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:33,829
Shit. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. When mounting multiple images, you still have a

319
00:48:33,829 --> 00:48:37,030
good disk control. You can then switch between the amount of disk control and the amount of disk control

320
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:47,030
before. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on a second, guys. Guys. Mounting multiple images. Let's do it.

321
00:48:47,349 --> 00:48:56,650
Let's go. That's not an Alt F4 joke. It's not. All right. Mounting multiple. How do I mount?

322
00:48:57,530 --> 00:49:06,170
I need a DOS cool person to save me right now. This game has seven disks. It's got to be mounted

323
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:17,110
in the same drive. It is. We're good. How do I mount multiple? It's mount extra. It's on DOS box.

324
00:49:25,019 --> 00:49:49,139
You can't. I can't. No. Delete C Windows System 32. I use Daemon tools. We'll go back to that

325
00:49:49,139 --> 00:50:04,360
when I get a DOS person. It's okay because we're moving on. We're moving on to this one. Do a full

326
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:19,030
stream on Ripper. I'm gonna go back to Ripper. Let's open it up. We're gonna go from there.

327
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:31,219
We're gonna go on to Kingdom 2. Wait, somebody's got it. Is that correct? Like, is that correct?

328
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:37,590
Sawdust bunnies. Is that correct? Is that the correct way that I do this? Just mount them all

329
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:43,380
in the same place. Just mount them all. Just mount them all. Just type them. Just mount them all.

330
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:54,519
Just list them all in one command. And then it's Ctrl F4, right? Hold on. Stay right there.

331
00:50:55,079 --> 00:51:16,940
I'm gonna try that. Don't accidentally press Alt F4. I tried to do this before, too. This is

332
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:24,250
not gonna end well. I have to move on. Just install Windows. I tried to run this through

333
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:35,940
Virtual Machine and I couldn't get it to work. All right. I gotta move on. I have to. This is

334
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:48,599
gonna take too long. I'm gonna try this one time and we'll see what happens. I gotta get this on

335
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:52,760
screen so people can tell me if I'm doing it right. This is the one time I'm gonna try this.

336
00:51:55,639 --> 00:52:07,579
Tell me. This is a troubleshooting stream. You ready? So, all of the disks are in this folder

337
00:52:07,579 --> 00:52:16,309
called FMV. Welcome to the stream. Hey, everybody. How are you? Okay. So, that's the drive that it's

338
00:52:16,309 --> 00:52:27,510
in. Okay. They're all in there. RIP 1, RIP 2, RIP 3, RIP 4, RIP 5. I already screwed it up. It's

339
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:49,559
image mount. All right. So, that's that. That's that, right? I'm hacking with two fingers. I am.

340
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:57,769
You're right. I absolutely am. Okay. Is this correct? Somebody has an image of this. Somebody

341
00:52:57,849 --> 00:53:07,030
has an image of this. Let me see. This is not gonna do anything.

342
00:53:11,059 --> 00:53:20,340
This is not an image. Why did you link this? I need help. I need fucking help. I need not this.

343
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:37,690
I need help. All right. Somebody help me. If I do this for all of them and then I do dash t

344
00:53:38,329 --> 00:53:47,800
dash iso. Is this gonna work? No. Stop laughing. Stop laughing. Everybody, I need people to stop

345
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:56,219
laughing. I need help. I'm gonna do it. So, is this correct? Just end it. Okay. Hold on.

346
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:23,289
Okay. Then there's four. Everyone stop laughing. I can't see the chat. Stop laughing. Stop laughing

347
00:54:23,289 --> 00:54:41,579
at me. Okay. Here we go. And there's enough. There's six fucking disks. God damn it. I even

348
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:49,880
was gonna buy like an old Macintosh computer on eBay. But the description said that the screen

349
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:53,239
was broken and that I needed to bring it to a repair shop. It was gonna be like 1200 bucks.

350
00:54:53,880 --> 00:55:15,130
So, I didn't do it. Okay. Here we go. Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, is this gonna work? Will that do

351
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:20,469
it? And then I need to I need a computer programmer in the chat to tell me that's gonna work. Do you

352
00:55:20,469 --> 00:55:35,260
have computer programming skills? No. That's not gonna work. I'm an IT major. It won't work. Look

353
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:38,860
at this link. Look at this link. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Stop. Stop laughing. Stop

354
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:48,650
writing text. It's possible to mount more than one image in a page. Imagesmount.com. Why is it

355
00:55:48,650 --> 00:56:18,789
.com? .com? Why does it say Imagesmount.com? Like that. You put an extra. I'm a DOS major and I

356
00:56:18,789 --> 00:56:25,670
guarantee it'll absolutely work. Trust me. Open the link. There's a typo. No, there's not. There's

357
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:36,250
no typo. There's an extra rip where. Okay. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Is it Imagesmount.com?

358
00:56:41,139 --> 00:56:59,139
Oh, God damn it. Imagesmount.com. All right. Imagesmount.com. It is. I did it right. I did

359
00:56:59,139 --> 00:57:04,900
it right the first time. I need a computer analyst to explain this to me. Imagesmount.com. D. E.

360
00:57:06,969 --> 00:57:20,340
to the tutorial for you. And people are writing so much. That code will. That code is going to

361
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:30,469
break your computer. No. All right. So hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. So I need someone

362
00:57:30,469 --> 00:57:34,230
to tell me. I won't. I'm going to put it on emote only mode and then I'm going to pull.

363
00:57:38,869 --> 00:57:48,739
If I. Okay. Now if I continue to do this, will it work? Did I have it right the first time?

364
00:57:48,739 --> 00:57:58,699
I had it right the first time. Read the guide. Just look at doc box wiki. It's not .com.

365
00:57:59,579 --> 00:58:13,300
So I had it right the first time. More than one image. Yes, I know. Okay. So yeah. D. Remember

366
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:20,260
E is my, what I have as my C drive. Right. So I just have to do everything that I did normally.

367
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:35,420
So Imagesmount. D. All the stuff. And then dash T. CDROM. Is that correct? That's correct? Oh,

368
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:56,070
let's go. Let's go. Let's go. How do you say let's go when you're doing shell command?

369
00:58:57,260 --> 00:59:04,380
I don't understand how you. This is why you give programming to our

370
00:59:06,139 --> 00:59:33,590
FMV slash rip one dot ISO. Then the next one. Right. Dude, let's go. I'm so stupid. Okay. Check

371
00:59:33,590 --> 00:59:57,380
my work while I go, please. Okay. What's going on here? Why does this look so fucked up? What

372
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:59,059
happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? What

373
00:59:59,059 --> 01:00:01,139
happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? What

374
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:19,639
happened? What happened? Why did it do that? I can't go back. What? I can only do one line?

375
01:00:23,559 --> 01:00:37,110
No, it was, it was a different line. No, I have to go. I have to hold on. Oh,

376
01:00:40,389 --> 01:00:55,239
everybody stop talking. Thank you. Appreciate it. Okay. Okay. Okay.

377
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:28,300
They can't. This is the programming humor subreddit where it's like, whoops, I get to

378
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:38,659
slash instead of a dash. I can't imagine this is why they get paid the big bucks.

379
01:01:38,659 --> 01:01:52,820
D E. Okay. That's correct. I'm going to do this as we go. E rip to ISO space E FMV rip three

380
01:01:52,820 --> 01:02:08,500
dot IS. Don't get it wrong. Okay. That's all correct. E FMV rip four dot ISO. Okay. That's

381
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:32,730
correct. So far space E FMV rip five dot ISO done space E slash FMV rip six dot ISO done dash

382
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:46,260
T ISO. Is this correct? Do I press enter? This will do it. This is going to work. I'm seeing a

383
01:02:46,260 --> 01:03:05,880
lot of yeses. I'm seeing a lot of yeses. A lot of them. It worked. Did it work? Did it work? Did

384
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:16,539
it work? Is that it? Do I not touch anything? Did it work? I think it worked. Okay. Now we go.

385
01:03:17,340 --> 01:04:12,699
We got it. Here we go. Don't touch anything. Okay. What happened? What happened? What happened?

386
01:04:12,699 --> 01:04:36,710
Get this fucking thing off the screen. What do I do? Control F4, right? That puts me in another

387
01:04:36,710 --> 01:05:03,929
disk. I have to be on disk one. Okay. Disk two of six is now active. Hold on. Fuck did I do?

388
01:05:03,929 --> 01:05:13,739
I need disk one. Control F4. Disk three is now active. Disk four is now active.

389
01:05:13,739 --> 01:05:26,679
Disk five. Disk six. Disk one is now active. Disk one is in. It's in there.

390
01:05:45,989 --> 01:05:57,699
It works. But does it work? Combat medium. It worked. Everybody chill the fuck out.

391
01:05:57,699 --> 01:06:07,349
Everybody's everybody. Wait, wait. Hold on. I think I got it. I think I got it. We're moving

392
01:06:07,349 --> 01:06:15,639
around. This is disk one. This is important. Because if I can change the disk to and press

393
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:24,090
okay, then holy fuck. I am a goddamn genius. I just need to check to make sure this is going

394
01:06:24,090 --> 01:06:31,059
to work. Oh yeah. Right. This has got to get off the screen. You're right. Okay. Here we go.

395
01:06:32,329 --> 01:06:38,869
Newsroom. Insert disk two into the drive. Control F4. You're on disk two now.

396
01:06:38,869 --> 01:07:19,079
I'm gonna relish in this one. I am gonna relish in this shit. You better believe it.

397
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:31,780
You didn't think I was smart enough to handle this. Nobody did. But I am. You didn't think I

398
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:39,880
was fucking smart enough to handle it. Oh, but you were wrong. You were all wrong. I knew about

399
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:45,900
the mounting. I knew about the images. I knew about the onion. Although it's hard to recalibrate

400
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:52,219
this. That's all right. It looks good. Let's go. I'm fucking on. I'm absolutely on cloud nine right

401
01:07:52,219 --> 01:07:59,699
now. I'm like so happy. I did that under pressure too. That was a fucking end zone pass that I just

402
01:07:59,699 --> 01:08:19,859
I it was an end zone pass. Can you guys see? How did I gain viewers doing that? That's I don't

403
01:08:19,859 --> 01:08:39,500
know how that's possible. I'm supposed to meet somebody here, right? They expected a cool

404
01:08:39,579 --> 01:08:55,159
programming stream. All right. Somebody in there. There's a brain. I think I think our

405
01:08:55,159 --> 01:09:03,899
whack the machine is still going to be broken though. A computer with a deck port can never

406
01:09:03,899 --> 01:09:28,140
have too many of those. Okay. Should I go in? Exit cyberspace. Why is this supposed to be

407
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:42,779
virtual reality? Berman incorporated. Virtual library. Virtual library. Sure. Let's open it up.

408
01:09:43,659 --> 01:10:00,659
I hope it asks me to change this because I'm ready for it. Who's this? I can't see with it.

409
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:08,539
I know with some call numbers on it. Am I underwater? Could Renee Stein have left this here?

410
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:17,479
I could use some help here. You're a human presence I assume. Everyone at a service desk is. The

411
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:27,930
library doesn't use smart sprites for public interface. You don't read much do you? This

412
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:34,260
sucks. Go back to DOS box coding. Ask if she's seen Renee Stein. Did you see a woman named Renee

413
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:39,699
Stein recently? Records place her here but she didn't check anything out and I don't remember

414
01:10:39,699 --> 01:10:47,420
seeing her. Okay what about the call number? Can you help me with this call number? I'm sorry this

415
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:53,500
is not a valid call number. It appears Stein altered the reference matrix but an unknown book

416
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:57,899
was distributed. If you could unscramble the call number I could help you.

417
01:10:57,899 --> 01:11:04,520
Unscramble the call number. Prior period distribution list. Physical deletion

418
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:30,949
uncompleted. Okay address call number. Who am I doing this for? What? That's all I know.

419
01:11:30,949 --> 01:11:49,800
Just tell me what it is. Just tell me what it is.

420
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:07,699
HC. I don't care. HC4. No is this correct? No I'm not writing that unless I know it's for real.

421
01:12:07,779 --> 01:12:18,649
I don't know. I don't know if that. I'm not writing that. I don't know what that is. Can I get a mod

422
01:12:18,649 --> 01:12:32,779
to look it up? I can look it up. The HC is on my screen. Alright so what was it? I thought you

423
01:12:32,779 --> 01:12:44,060
guys were writing like he shit whatever. Like he wrote a thing he didn't think of as he was writing

424
01:12:44,779 --> 01:13:17,739
but he did. Like he shit. HC what was it? 45. Say it again. Tell me what the code is. 73T.

425
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:35,340
I think the game crashed. You should really look into this Quinlan. It could mean something.

426
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:44,789
Did I get it? Can you help me with this call number? I'm sorry this is not a valid call number.

427
01:13:45,350 --> 01:13:51,029
It appears Stein altered the reference matrix but an unknown book was distributed. If you

428
01:13:51,029 --> 01:14:03,130
could unscramble the call number I could help you. What is it? HC is the actual number. HC.

429
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:18,489
No. Two. I looked it up. The four numbers are contained in the square brackets.

430
01:14:19,609 --> 01:14:22,810
Didn't know how to figure it out. You need to make sense of the algebra. You can read the code like

431
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:33,829
this. So this one was it? What's the last one? Wait Quinlan that's a valid call number. I'll get

432
01:14:33,829 --> 01:14:38,710
the book. People didn't think I was capable of doing it but I just continue to prove them wrong.

433
01:14:40,470 --> 01:14:45,020
A book about the original Jack the Ripper. Can't be a coincidence.

434
01:14:45,659 --> 01:14:51,260
Renee Stein must have used this but what does it mean? You read chat. I didn't read chat.

435
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:57,880
You talk to them. Have the cops talked to you? They asked questions but I couldn't tell them much.

436
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:02,279
They copied all the files from the Victorian route directory and ordered us not to alter the

437
01:15:02,279 --> 01:15:06,520
file structures until the case is solved. I've been streaming for like six hours. The day Stein

438
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:14,840
was killed would still be here. Guess so. I sure didn't take them. All right well I got some new info.

439
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:26,859
I'm out. How do I leave? Oh you got a new info. How do I get the fuck out of here?

440
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:33,670
All I can do for you is recommend something to read Quinlan. How about Marchox the da Vinci

441
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:39,670
engine? It's a study that reveals how Leonardo theorized cyberspace back in the 17th century.

442
01:15:44,329 --> 01:15:53,659
How do I leave? Oh you have to press escape. All right I got new info. I'm gonna it's midnight

443
01:15:53,659 --> 01:16:02,180
always. Watch out for the skull. Dangerous. Watch out for the I don't know what that was. Sun. Moon.

444
01:16:03,289 --> 01:16:30,199
I. Exit. Exit cyberspace. Yes. Okay whew whew. Jake if anything should happen to me

445
01:16:31,079 --> 01:16:44,460
lose the crystals. Look to the crystals and let the light shine your way. All right where's like

446
01:16:44,460 --> 01:17:03,590
the I want to fight. I think I gotta go talk to the chief. No not this way. Don't fight. It's okay.

447
01:17:04,310 --> 01:17:13,739
There's an this is an adventure game. There is no fighting. It says there's combat in the game.

448
01:17:15,979 --> 01:17:19,659
There is combat in the game and I'm gonna see it. There we are. I want to go in here.

449
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:35,130
No why are you leaving? Here we are. Here we go. Ben dogs. Give me a new area and we're gonna get

450
01:17:35,130 --> 01:17:49,420
our first fist fight. Hey Ben. How's Catherine today? No change. Now his coat looks like it's

451
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:57,270
made out of licorice. I'm not gonna lie. This guy's the devil himself. Ben you know this cop

452
01:17:57,270 --> 01:18:06,409
Magnata? Typical new breed cop. One of those guys started arresting people in volume when cops started

453
01:18:06,409 --> 01:18:13,130
to select. Salami. He's uh been more aggressive than most. Yeah that's common knowledge but

454
01:18:13,130 --> 01:18:18,890
what's his story? He's killed six people in the line of duty summoned to questionable circumstances.

455
01:18:19,529 --> 01:18:28,229
He's bad news. I wouldn't mess with him Quentin. Do the funny voice which one is Ben? All right

456
01:18:28,229 --> 01:18:35,109
where's uh what about Joey Falconetti? You ever hear of a Joey Falconetti Ben? No the name sounds

457
01:18:35,109 --> 01:18:43,720
vaguely familiar but I can't quite place it. All right well let's go let's get out of here. I'm

458
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:54,899
going to see Joey. I can't wait to change disc because that I mean that was just hold on I got

03:58:38,459 --> 03:58:46,219
to get blind spots in my vision it's almost like like it's like tinny metallic colors will appear

1013

1018
03:59:33,879 --> 03:59:42,540

1068
04:07:48,340 --> 04:07:53,540
thousand bit badge thank you so much for copious amounts of great content been watching for five

1069
04:07:53,540 --> 04:08:02,059
years or so you're easily my favorite content creator on both platforms let's see if i can

1070
04:08:02,059 --> 04:08:36,760
keep that going i'm gonna try oh lord phylactery holy shit man how does he do it i don't know but

1071
04:08:36,760 --> 04:08:58,569
they continue to do that's 69 more community subs from phylactery religion that puts you

1072
04:08:59,879 --> 04:09:05,159
you are now responsible for a very large percentage of the people that have subscribed

1073
04:09:05,159 --> 04:09:25,379
to this channel now that's a pretty significant portion of people that are subbed so thank you

1074
04:09:26,200 --> 04:09:34,950
completely completely unnecessary at this point because that's so much money i hope you can afford

1075
04:09:34,950 --> 04:09:43,780
it if you can then fucking awesome i'm i'm glad you got a lot of money if you can't make sure

1076
04:09:43,780 --> 04:09:55,219
you're taking care of yourself first that's very important he owns you now i got too loud i'm not

1077
04:09:55,219 --> 04:10:01,850
supposed to be getting loud but phylactery that's an insane amount of subs sometimes this happens

1078
04:10:01,850 --> 04:10:07,450
somebody gives a shitload of money over the course of a month or two and it just floors me

1079
04:10:07,450 --> 04:10:13,209
so i can't believe it i'm shocked that somebody wouldn't want to give me this much money as one

1080
04:10:13,209 --> 04:10:25,450
single person so thank you i hope you can afford it thank you doctor and chat yeah and good luck

1081
04:10:25,450 --> 04:10:37,780
in with your with your patients because you're obviously a doctor and a scientist combined oh

1082
04:10:37,780 --> 04:10:46,899
i didn't mention that hat in time right hat in time um probably not if i'm completely honest

1083
04:10:50,120 --> 04:10:53,879
switch to this because i i do have i'm gonna go take like a bath or something just so

1084
04:10:53,879 --> 04:11:03,260
i'm gonna like soak my head in water um probably not not now i don't want to say yeah maybe sure

1085
04:11:03,260 --> 04:11:08,120
maybe you'll see it so i don't want to do that because there's so much stuff going on over the

1086
04:11:08,120 --> 04:11:13,000
next few weeks that that this would end up being another one of those scenarios where

1087
04:11:13,959 --> 04:11:19,959
oh yeah maybe a few weeks on and then in end of october someone's gonna ask the same question

1088
04:11:19,959 --> 04:11:31,530
and i'm gonna be like oh yeah um maybe you know maybe a few weeks so i don't want to tell people

1089
04:11:31,530 --> 04:11:37,479
that i'm gonna be doing things and then just not do them when's the carnival it's the 21st

1121
04:16:12,819 --> 04:16:18,579
of technical difficulties um i don't think so because there are a bunch of engineers working

1122
04:16:18,579 --> 04:16:24,020
on this and a full production company so there are two different companies that are doing this

1123

way more shit like this because that's the direction that i want to take the stream

1154
04:20:15,899 --> 04:20:24,629
i've been talking about this shit for years and not done it so many things fell through the cracks

1155
04:20:25,190 --> 04:20:30,309
i'm working with a company and it didn't work out oh that company doesn't exist anymore

1156
04:20:30,309 --> 04:20:35,190
well this company wanted to do that but i didn't want to do that i've been just i've been trying

1157
04:20:35,190 --> 04:20:42,170
to do more high production stuff for like two or three years and shit always just didn't work out

1158
04:20:43,190 --> 04:20:54,219

1223
04:30:48,600 --> 04:30:53,219

1224
04:30:53,219 --> 04:31:06,950
no debate there there isn't you want to debate me about this i'll open up the debate right now

1228
04:31:31,739 --> 04:31:39,110
far from home spider-man one spider-verse and homecoming no spider-man no there are this four

1229

1239
04:33:25,459 --> 04:33:33,060
dollars i'm trying to fix my dumb mental state lately and i think uh and i'm always moved at

1240
04:33:33,060 --> 04:33:37,459
the fact that you can still manage to lift some sort of weight off of me when i can tune into a

1241
04:33:37,459 --> 04:33:41,540
stream i've been on a roller coaster ride of emotions and i will say you help slow it down

1242
04:33:45,459 --> 04:33:55,479
i wish you the best take it slow work on yourself however you know you can because you're the only

1243
04:33:55,560 --> 04:34:09,990
one that knows how to do that i am honored to lift some weight off of you and anybody else

1244
04:34:16,810 --> 04:34:23,209
i just want the streams to be fun i don't i don't care about anything else you know what i'm saying

1245
04:34:23,849 --> 04:34:28,729
i want you to have fun i want us to enjoy the streams together i want obviously i want to have

1246
04:34:28,729 --> 04:34:34,340
fun i want to enjoy what i'm doing i want us to collectively think everything is a fun time

1247
04:34:36,099 --> 04:34:43,860
nothing else nothing else matters it really doesn't so when people tell me that it's they're

1248
04:34:43,860 --> 04:34:59,819
having fun and it's like helping them and it's shit it's that means a lot i like how you don't

1249
04:34:59,819 --> 04:35:12,740
make it all about yourself that's pretty cool um well it isn't it can't be because you you're

1250
04:35:12,740 --> 04:35:19,400
the ones that have to be entertained you know what i mean as much as it's about me it is also about

1251
04:35:19,400 --> 04:35:26,150
you the reason why i try to do things that might be more fun or more entertaining sometimes

1252
04:35:26,790 --> 04:35:30,869
is because i want you to watch like for instance the carnival i i'm not doing the carnival

1253
04:35:31,430 --> 04:35:36,630
just because well you know either like let me just like piss away a bunch of money

1254
04:35:37,430 --> 04:35:41,990
and oh i can't wait this is gonna be great for me i'm gonna have a lot of fun here

1255
04:35:43,700 --> 04:35:47,619
you know what i'm not even gonna turn on the stream i think i'm just gonna not turn the stream

1256
04:35:47,619 --> 04:35:53,830
on and just have a carnival no it's because it's potentially a fun interesting thing that

1257
04:35:53,830 --> 04:35:58,150
you guys can participate in that i think and i that interests me that's why i only look

1258
04:35:59,720 --> 04:36:09,369
if something interests me i'm gonna do it it doesn't matter what it is it's gonna happen

1259
04:36:11,080 --> 04:36:18,169
i get so stuck and locked in on doing things that i think would be fun for the stream sometimes to

1260
04:36:18,169 --> 04:36:24,790
the detriment sometimes to my own detriment but then i think about oh but that would be fun

1261
04:36:24,790 --> 04:36:28,790
wouldn't it i think people would think that was fun i think that's fun maybe they would too

1262
04:36:29,590 --> 04:36:42,569
that's all i need to hear that's all i need to know that's why he spent five million dollars

1263
04:36:42,569 --> 04:37:05,189
on the carnival i mean i think you're pretty close not for real i i wouldn't be doing it

1264
04:37:06,840 --> 04:37:13,689
if i wasn't having a good time and it didn't interest me and if it wasn't interesting you

1265
04:37:14,409 --> 04:37:17,669
because i don't you know you know i don't want to have one of those i don't have like a stream

1266
04:37:17,750 --> 04:37:23,000
where it's just like every day it's just like hey i don't i don't like this at all

1267
04:37:24,180 --> 04:37:34,200
oh okay well i don't i don't want that i don't want you to do that now some streams will be

1268
04:37:34,200 --> 04:37:42,490
more exciting i think than others and i can't have something crazy fucking like i can't have

1269
04:37:42,490 --> 04:37:57,909
like a carnival stream every fucking stream that's impossible but it is on my mind all the time but

1270
04:37:57,990 --> 04:38:08,889
thank you why not now you are talking five million dollars that is that number is real

1271
04:38:08,889 --> 04:38:26,650
if that is the case but thank you flood boy thank you future gamer for the 250 what is the current

1274
04:38:44,650 --> 04:38:56,520
fucking crazy if you remember that do you guys remember like four months ago when i had like

1275
04:38:56,520 --> 04:39:10,060
seven fucking thousands of that was fucking crazy so it's we've kind of evened out a little bit here

1276
04:39:11,380 --> 04:39:29,240
add another fucking crazy number when did it get so high this year it fluctuates though

1277
04:39:29,880 --> 04:39:37,259
so it'll go it's i can't give you like an exact i mean that's the current snapshot of subscribers

1278
04:39:37,259 --> 04:39:44,380

1279
04:39:44,380 --> 04:39:51,500
thousand i have no idea it's kind of all over the place when it comes to um just like exact numbers

1280
04:39:51,500 --> 04:40:00,279
