1
00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:08,439
Let me just change the category and uh oh I need my controller.

2
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:11,080
You guys play this game with a controller or do you play it with a keyboard mouse?

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:25,449
How the hell would you play this with keyboard and mouse? I think that'd be really really hard to do.

4
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:35,859
Okay you can't see anything yet you will very soon.

5
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:56,549
Here we are okay so what's the oh this I've already turned the music off.

6
00:00:57,189 --> 00:01:12,040
We keep the music off. We'll keep it on. Let me just change the title and we can go.

7
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:19,340
Uh the title's uh gonna get out of prison today um whatever I don't care.

8
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:32,950
That's fine. This bit's I mean a little bit.

9
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:44,810
I'm app I'm definitely not gonna come even close by the way to winning a single match.

10
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:58,040
There's a lot of colors in this game and change it to finally out of prison.

11
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,710
Keep making jokes like you're actually getting out of prison today.

12
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:17,110
Like wait why are they letting me I've just I'm streaming Fall Guys from prison?

13
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:33,900
Yes I mean you guys already all know that that's bullshit.

14
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:40,629
It would be a thing that we do to to the one person that ends up coming and I I'm gonna lose.

15
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:55,060
Maybe not. Maybe not. There's always somebody worse than you and there's always somebody better than you.

16
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,460
Remember that. It's a very important thing to remember in life.

17
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:17,419
He's a sage. Sage. I'm a sage. That's pretty sage-like.

18
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:29,460
If he wins he goes free. What like everyone all the other inmates are playing right now.

19
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:34,090
Whoever wins this gets the get out of jail free card.

20
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:47,139
That's really messed up. It's already a series.

21
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:51,219
Dead Man Wonderland. Is that like a show?

22
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:03,210
All right I hate the egg one. The egg one's always too hard.

23
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:15,979
Sorry. You just don't want to come in last and I'm gonna get that gold medal.

24
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,329
I'll get it. Yeah.

25
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:33,139
Stop. Leave me alone. We only have 11 in here.

26
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:44,649
Now this is not even that interesting to me because you just see this shit on Easter every

27
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:51,189
year anyways. A bunch of little kids just fucking going nuts looking for the hidden eggs.

28
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:03,589
Holy shit. You guys ever do that thing or you guys have your parents do that thing or somebody

29
00:05:04,149 --> 00:05:07,110
it always caused a huge problem for some reason. It just did.

30
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:12,949
All the little hidden eggs for Easter. Yeah we're gonna do the egg hunt.

31
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:17,509
And for some reason like one of the participants somebody that came over that day or somebody

32
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:21,350
that was there or an aunt or an uncle or a friend of the family doesn't matter

33
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:27,269
put like the like a 20 dollar bill or like a 50 dollar bill in one of them.

34
00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:35,269
Like a 10 dollar bill would be in one of them and it's like dude like don't you come on like

35
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:41,509
whoever gets that's gonna get like 50 bucks. These are like six-year-olds they don't even

36
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:48,810
know what money is. Don't don't do that. Put like a lot of pieces in there man. Oh don't

37
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:52,009
don't put like a 20 dollar bill in there you're gonna start fighting.

38
00:05:55,209 --> 00:06:00,889
And then everyone just says well you know we'll just use uh we'll just use that for something.

39
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,569
Like the kid doesn't even get the money like his parents do.

40
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:18,170
Oh wow yeah little little little John got a 50 dollar bill in there. Oh good for you sport.

41
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:24,779
Mommy will hold on to that one. But the parents you just go out to like a nice dinner with you

42
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:46,060
and like your husband. What somebody said what's wrong with your family. I saw at least a handful

43
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:54,069
of people say that that was something they remembered. You can't just do any amount of

44
00:06:54,069 --> 00:06:58,310
money is bad because you put a dollar in there even a seven-year-old knows. Oh that's fucking

45
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:03,430
nothing dude. Like even when you're like eight nine years old it's like oh this one's got money

46
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:11,769
in it. It's two dollars. Oh this is not this is nothing. A dollar. Why is this even in the egg?

47
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,790
And then like you go you look over like your uncle's like smoking a fucking cigarette like

48
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:26,360
in the corner like yeah you don't spend it all in one place. It's obviously like it was a way

49
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,240
that like he was making a joke with like one of the other uncles or aunts or something.

50
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:43,459
I'm winning. I literally cannot even buy candy with a dollar because of taxes.

51
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:54,300
We literally might be related. I don't know what are the six thousand people here?

52
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:02,259
What's the percentage that somebody in this chat might be like genetically related to me somehow?

53
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:28,139
It's probably fairly high. Everyone would be weird. Your mother watches the streams. Yeah but I mean

54
00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:39,779
not somebody that I know is watching. Like I'm sure one or two of you guys in this chat have

55
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:56,299
shared some old like shoemaker back in like the 1400s or something. Guys don't you understand

56
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:05,000
there there was like 40 people on earth at one point right there was like there was like

57
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:15,379
2 000 people that lived in like Connecticut as of like 1442. There weren't that many people.

58
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:34,090
They're not even gonna score one point. Classic American. Okay somebody's cheating I think. I

59
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:40,980
think we have a cheater. Is somebody cheating? We might have a cheater. No I think we're just good.

60
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:54,090
Yeah all that mattered was you had like a little town and there was like 17 houses and like a

61
00:09:54,090 --> 00:10:00,840
hundred people lived in your town and one of you guys sold milk the other one yeah you had corn

62
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,080
and shit and some of you guys were like tough and were like defenders and some of you guys had

63
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,799
you know you one of you guys was a blacksmith we all just like got along we all just spent this

64
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:26,230
bunch of time together everybody had one job and we all just did it defenders yeah I don't know

65
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:29,990
they'd be like fights they'd be people would kind of try to steal the corn and we'd have to have

66
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:45,080
somebody fight it's not gonna be me look at me I would I would be a wizard that's I would be one

67
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:51,379
of the fucking wizards you know what I mean oh I'm doing that thing again where I combine two

68
00:10:51,379 --> 00:11:06,970
things one in real life and not one in real life all right never mind that's 10 to nothing

69
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:16,789

77
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:13,769
he was running down there I was waiting for him to run down and he saw me at the last second he

78
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:17,049
instantly turned around he had freaked out and he ripped the other fucking direction

79
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:55,419

82
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:35,480
I did technically it did win one I've come pretty close two or three times maybe a little bit more

83
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:41,460
than that I've come pretty close maybe five or six times like the final three final five

84
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:59,179
they really are ruining everything aren't they I'm gonna take the initiative I'm going the other

85
00:15:59,179 --> 00:16:26,360
way I thought I could jump across stop get out of my way I every time I touch somebody I get like

86
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:48,009
all over I really I'm in trouble wait a bunch of people got dumped okay who is weighing this down

87
00:16:48,730 --> 00:17:18,710
he's in for a life sentence yeah I forgot the prison thing I'll get there I'll get I got it I

89
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:42,220
counter-strike a very long time ago and I actually probably have three or four videos on the subject

90
00:17:50,619 --> 00:18:00,200
and they're not they're just stupid ass videos it that was so much fun though back when it was

91
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:23,750
really popular those are my only good videos I disagree but it's because I like free kill a

92
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:41,079
bunch of people in those videos do you get the stamp of your approval what's your best video in

93
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:49,990
my in your opinion um I don't think it's I can't really do that I feel like I most videos I made

94
00:18:49,990 --> 00:19:03,019
I really liked for the most part yeah but I mean the live action germa rumble is like just that's

95
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:08,890
that's like just the complete was the complete package for me it just I had so much fun making

96
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:14,730
that it was so it was such a fun experience doing that and it was just so grueling to do it but

97
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:21,559
I think it was so much fun and just like yeah like this just the setup for how that came to

98
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:29,509
be in the first place was just I had a lot of fun doing it so or the uh the photos are in that was

102
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:30,440
gonna go back to it I had my fun with it I don't know if I'm gonna do it it's a very hard game and

103
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:35,880
it makes me very very nervous and scared and anxious when I play it because I might not beat

104
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:52,059
the game and I've got to try really hard it's very hard it's fun game it's because the casino

105
00:20:52,059 --> 00:21:07,319
isn't it well no grab a tail you know what everyone runs around like crazy trying desperately to grab

106
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:13,690
somebody's tail in this I'm gonna show you the way that you should play this and that is

107
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:19,769
don't do anything just hang out and just scope out like the guy in the lower right

108
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:26,200
he is hiding right now that's the guy I'm gonna keep my eye on because never mind he already lost

109
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,920
it you want to keep your eye on the people that are actually hiding that aren't being seen by

110
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:40,920
anybody but you this person right here is the target see them on the left that person right

111
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:51,000
there is the target like a fucking bald eagle we're gonna stalk this person and we're gonna

112
00:21:51,000 --> 00:22:22,250
strike at the very last moment just give me yours he you walked right by me as you see we got the

113
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:40,009
fucking prey that we wanted I told you I was gonna get that guy I dropped a lot of people

114
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:52,819
yeah you hunted that child we already talked about this the last time I played this game

115
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:59,240
everyone says that it's a bunch of children but we're all like 30 plus at least 25 plus

116
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:06,069
everyone says though oh yeah like I've beaten all these kids and they're all just 27 like just

117
00:23:06,069 --> 00:23:22,569
sitting in their houses find the path oh shit wait who knows the right way somebody move

118
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:35,740
oh get out of the way out of the way out of the way out of the way out of the way out of

119
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:47,299
the way out of the way get out of my way you just have to get across the finish line that bastard

120
00:23:53,819 --> 00:23:54,140
shit

121
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:41,420
you fucking asshole the first time I've ever seen that game that one's fun I okay I want more fun

122
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:47,180
weird stuff like that unless everybody run the same direction and get squished by the same door

123
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:55,859
I like stuff like that it's fun like this one this is the one I'm talking about I don't like this one

124
00:24:55,859 --> 00:25:14,390
okay this one would be funny with like five people like 10 people as it stands right now

125
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:19,109
everyone just smushes everywhere and it doesn't matter it's just someone's gonna walk into one

126
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:30,819
like if this was 10 people then a bunch of people would really have problem it would be fun funny

127
00:25:30,819 --> 00:25:44,180
because once one person goes through every single person knows the answer but if there was only like

128
00:25:44,180 --> 00:26:03,859
four or five of us someone's gonna make a mistake he hates it

129
00:26:03,859 --> 00:26:26,519
it flew across the map but you mean like actually like flew or fell like flying and

130
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:40,519
falling are two different actions like guy hacking flying and guy falling off edge got launched

131
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:58,700
remember we can see your cheat engine and this is important in a minute this is important

132
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:25,480
hug the right side they all came on the right side yeah we're good oh I just missed that one

133
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:29,740
just missed just missed just missed just missed just missed just missed

134
00:27:30,700 --> 00:28:01,339
it's okay qualified he's cheating confirmed oh yeah hold on actually this is gonna be hard to do

135
00:28:01,339 --> 00:28:11,210
never mind I was gonna put a full screen video of like this computer glitch noises and words

136
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:26,359
and scrambled letters and accidentally showed on stream it wasn't worth it avoid the walls and stay

137
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:35,019
on the platform this is I haven't seen this one either he didn't commit to it well I'm I'm

138
00:28:35,019 --> 00:28:41,349
currently in the middle of a game where I can't really stop so what do we have to do is to fit

139
00:28:41,349 --> 00:28:58,519
through what I get it this person's cheating how do you do that how do you cheat I think you have

140
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:06,019
to jump on somebody else's head you do you do you do you do you do why do I care about cheating

141
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:23,900
I could have just won that normally I didn't have to do that the definition of hubris yeah

142
00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:34,410
you gotta get up there before it even starts yeah oh well shit I was doing pretty good on that one

143
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:59,160
too what happened to one or two rounds I'm still having fun I want to get to the final round again

144
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:14,359
whatever happens happens somebody fucked that whole thing up I don't know who did but

145
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:49,430
apparently it ruined everybody you can't just run forward oh no I'm in trouble I'm in trouble I got

146
00:30:51,269 --> 00:31:03,769
can't lose the first round can't lose the first round man can't just lose I fell off it's just

147
00:31:05,289 --> 00:31:09,529
push everybody together and somebody's always gonna get the short end of the stick

148
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:50,710
first round Andy I was in the last round before that last round Larry this is the worst fall guy

149
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:59,980
streamer I don't believe that for a second no way no way not a chance you know you know how I know

150
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:07,019
that because there are like 5 000 people playing this right now that are streaming this there's not

151
00:32:07,019 --> 00:32:12,490
a chance that I'm the worst one someone's always better than you someone's always worse than you

152
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:30,819
though remember that it's important you are the worst I'm not the worst fall guys but being okay

153
00:32:30,819 --> 00:32:47,380
being the worst fall guys player is just like saying yeah it's like saying you're bad at like

154
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:54,490
the jumpy house no it's you're not no one's bad at this game no one's good at this game

155
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:11,400
there is no bad there is no good there is just jumpy house he's coping you let me let me have it

156
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,319
you don't have to come in first place you know it doesn't matter if you come in last place you

157
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:34,539
got to jump in the jumpy house it's fine did I really not qualify I'm at the fucking finish line

158
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:40,380
shit maybe I am the worst streamer for this game I really might be the worst fall guy streamer that

159
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:45,700
I that's sad to think about my ego is getting in the way right now and it sucks like my ego

160
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:50,309
right now is like no no it's not possible Jerry but you can't be I mean that just that's two in

161
00:33:50,309 --> 00:33:59,380
a row if I make it three then it's possible hey no right at least I got to jump in the jumpy house

162
00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:15,510
it was kind of fun she had got to you no they didn't no don't lock me out don't lock me out

163
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:27,429
after that you didn't qualify for the next jumpy house it's called a bouncy house hey open up a

164
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:50,550
thesaurus and tell me what the word next to bouncy is jumpy is not a word jumpy is what do you mean

165
00:34:50,550 --> 00:35:07,480
it's not a word there's so much jumpy oh my god you guys it's called a bouncy castle it's a

166
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:15,610
jumpy house it doesn't matter is this the hill you want to die on it's actually it's called

167
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:22,380
bouncy castle not jumpy house that's the fucking bootleg shitty version that's how you know it's

168
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:41,349
a fake oh that's funny okay I can't do three if I get three in a row then I'm the worst fall guy

169
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:51,860
streamer on twitch all right I agree with you but that's not gonna happen I'm so scared that

170
00:35:51,860 --> 00:36:16,500
it's going to but it's not going to I can't be the worst fall guys player on twitch what are you

171
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:59,099
supposed to do why did you do that he knows he knows he's new not the worst fall guys player

172
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:16,219
on twitch he's screen cheating all right boogers just I just good thing this way I don't have a

173
00:37:16,219 --> 00:37:29,130
camera on thank god in the middle of all this somebody just writes Resident Evil 4 not today

174
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:49,460
like inception it's just I know it's an inception campaign I'm aware of it now all right let's get

175
00:37:49,460 --> 00:38:12,900
to the final round one that's not good I'll tell you I'm solely responsible for two of our points

176
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:22,469
I mean after offense and defense like that you're gonna tell me I'm the worst ball guys player on

177
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:53,420
twitch keep it over here where'd that come from no they why is blue over here is helping them

178
00:38:53,980 --> 00:39:31,139
can we get one I was not the worst player I was responsible for at least three points

179
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:50,679
where the points go like I'm not the whole team the whole team has to step up and start moving

180
00:39:50,679 --> 00:40:02,389
stuff yeah I'm out of prison I made it made it out an hour ago actually I got an hour and a

181
00:40:02,389 --> 00:40:13,340
half ago a little less than that maybe like 40 minutes all right this is my last one I'm done

182
00:40:13,340 --> 00:41:24,179
after this this is better be a good one needs to get out of jumpy prison yes it's not a bad one

183
00:41:24,179 --> 00:41:31,829
it's not bad unless you are the first person to lose you can if it's 40 people as long as your

184
00:41:31,829 --> 00:41:44,949
number 40 it wasn't a bad round you got in it doesn't matter it only matters when you get down

185
00:41:44,949 --> 00:42:04,409
to the last round you just have to qualify and having good internet qualifies too because if

186
00:42:04,409 --> 00:42:26,599
25 people drop here still counts I don't want to do this one again now how many premium skins do

187
00:42:26,599 --> 00:43:13,460
we have on our team two get in there give me these ones no don't push it back I've just rolled this

188
00:43:13,539 --> 00:43:21,019
dude I just rolled that guy unbelievable I just like necked myself I just like landed on my neck

189
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:42,309
how did I land how did I just connect I just landed on my neck I'm trying come on we have

190
00:43:42,309 --> 00:43:50,710
an opportunity in 15 seconds here it is dude why the fuck are we always at zero points

191
00:43:54,900 --> 00:44:11,349
if six fucking points I'm not done yellow always loses this is like one of those things where

192
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:19,610
somebody did the math a decade and a half ago and it was the the alliance had a slight advantage

193
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:30,360
on the lumber mill battlegrounds map what's it not the lumber what's it called the one with the

194
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:44,199
capture the flag that's it is it's a very old wow reference not a rathy no war song gulf there it

195
00:44:44,199 --> 00:44:53,420
is yeah I think the alliance had a tiny actually really documented slight advantage on that map

196
00:44:53,420 --> 00:45:14,380
is that yellow in this game for that exact game mode it was hoard what was the actual problem

197
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:24,889
though what was the issue I was lame and if you play it you probably smell well I guess 13 million

198
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:32,380
people smell that's probably accurate it's probably way more than that there's probably like 500

199
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:51,940
million people that smell right now in the world so get what I said oh no I jumped at the wrong

200
00:45:51,940 --> 00:46:03,210
time but it's okay look at all that extra weight this guy knows yeah he knows like I

201
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:10,170
notice like I turn around he turned around he went right boy he's trying to keep me as the worst

202
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:17,980
player on twitch mine too can play that game dude see I did that wait it was this guy that wasn't I

203
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:45,619
can't tell everyone's the same no it's just about being in 40th place and then you just eventually

204
00:46:45,619 --> 00:46:55,449
you get to first place have you guys ever read that book fast rabbit in the slow hair

205
00:46:56,250 --> 00:47:13,659
have you guys ever read that book fast germa and purple alien they talk about that why okay I feel

206
00:47:13,659 --> 00:47:18,699
like a lot of people are having a ton of problems right now why is this one so crappy why are we

207
00:47:18,699 --> 00:47:37,539
just getting fucked with what's going on oh I'm the only one weighing this one down oh

208
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:59,539
I'm not gonna qualify this guy this guy no I got like grabbed and dumped off the egg

209
00:48:05,739 --> 00:48:14,710
or no I'm not the worst fall guy streamer no it seems fun if you don't win yeah it's because

210
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:24,090
the going into jumpy house is fun if you it doesn't matter okay if you go in a jumpy house

211
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:27,530
and you're the first person to go in the jumpy house and the first person to leave the jumpy

212
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:34,039
house you don't go in and go I won when was the last time you heard somebody open up the doors of

213
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:47,510
a jumpy house come out and go I won was like a was there a brawl in there like all the other

214
00:48:47,510 --> 00:49:17,739
people in there like unconscious like beat up have a bounce yeah you know what somebody said

215
00:49:17,739 --> 00:49:22,539
bouncy house rumble it should just be a match at like the next live rumble where it's in a

216
00:49:22,539 --> 00:49:41,659
jumpy house and like the shit just gets like popped that's like collapsing out of spoilers

217
00:49:41,659 --> 00:50:03,989
don't worry you had the same idea I did second place lock it in we'll put it in the germ olympics

218
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:09,929
yeah for those of you that maybe didn't miss uh didn't catch the stream when we talked about this

219
00:50:09,929 --> 00:50:18,489
but we're talking about having a germ olympics where I just get a bunch of like don't mind like

220
00:50:18,489 --> 00:50:22,010
just like you shit-faced friends and we like do like random dumb olympic events

221
00:50:28,409 --> 00:50:33,210
like to balance the egg on your head like okay who's gonna get the gold medal for that one

222
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:44,920

223
00:50:45,639 --> 00:50:52,500
synchronized swimming no that's not no that's not an olympic event

224
00:50:53,300 --> 00:51:16,250
bounce egg on your head is not synchronized sleeping synchronized sleeping everyone just

225
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:22,869
turns off their lights at the same time but well how would you win or isn't the group that sleeps

226
00:51:22,869 --> 00:51:40,389
the longest two people in a sleeping competition they're under the covers and they're just lying

227
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:47,050
there and there's a timer and what the what the people don't know is that they've both dead

228
00:51:47,769 --> 00:51:54,150
like seven days go by and it's like wow this is the most unbelievable match we've ever seen

229
00:51:54,789 --> 00:52:04,579
and both of them are dead they both died keep cutting back to it like it's been like 12 days

230
00:52:05,219 --> 00:52:19,909

you don't win any money but one of the spaces that you scratch off says turn this in to get

274
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:28,869
the next layer of scratch ticket there's an even higher chance that you could win I have to just

275
01:06:28,869 --> 01:06:37,750
keep going back into like the convenience store just trading back and forth until I do that seven

276
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:51,139
times six times and then this one I might win money but the ticket is free no the ticket was

01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:33,560
when I play these games you have more viewers now than with Riddick that's all right I mean uh that

282
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:38,359
does not that surprising to me considering that this game is incredibly popular right now on twitch

283
01:09:38,359 --> 01:09:43,960
and with a bunch of people and has like a million concurrent players and the chronicles of Riddick

284
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:52,390
Butcher's Bay came out in 2004 and I think four of you played it it doesn't surprise me necessarily

285
01:09:58,069 --> 01:10:01,829
it was still I liked it I thought it was good I thought it was fun it was worth playing I'll put

286
01:10:01,829 --> 01:10:18,630
it that way all right this is the one win or lose win or lose that's it too many people

287
01:10:19,270 --> 01:10:39,989
I did an Aquaman shirt on that was pretty cool I don't know what happened there

288
01:10:39,989 --> 01:11:12,819
what's going on uh I can't keep getting lottery tickets I don't want any more lottery tickets

289
01:11:12,819 --> 01:11:20,100
my car my trunk is full of them they're just crumpled up none of them are winners they all

290
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:44,060
say great job on them you gotta get the expensive ones this is it this is actually the last one I'm

291
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:49,579

296
01:13:53,689 --> 01:14:29,739
big break right there no that thing just fucking came out of nowhere quit Fisto what happened to

297
01:14:29,739 --> 01:14:37,350
the mic what's wrong with it should be fine it should sound good right now what happened

298
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:46,539
because I'm leaning back in my chair all right maybe if I have like a different voice the whole

299
01:14:46,539 --> 01:14:56,710
time it'll be it'll be better okay how about this ready I'm just gonna keep this on just right here

300
01:14:57,819 --> 01:15:09,619
I'm gonna pretend like it's not on I'm just gonna pitch shift myself like down 20 30 percent

301
01:15:09,619 --> 01:15:29,319
okay here we go mute muted I'm not what I'm not muted I'm gonna prove that I'm not muted

304
01:16:11,529 --> 01:16:15,210
I'm putting my headphones and I'm putting on fucking I'm putting on like music I'm putting on

305
01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:31,340
some fucking music no not doom it's gotta be something like I'm like Katy Perry firework

306
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:42,310
is what I'm thinking but I can't play that uh but that same vibe okay is there any royalty free like

307
01:16:42,310 --> 01:17:16,149
Katy Perry like firework music it's a midi version I can't can I actually play a midi version I

308
01:17:16,149 --> 01:17:51,180
haven't heard that in a long time can you do that lawsuit Larry wait can I not play a midi

309
01:17:51,180 --> 01:18:06,789
version of a song can I play wait can I play a lawsuit version of a song oh I midi can I play

310
01:18:06,789 --> 01:18:21,770
a shine the bright just open minds just open minds like the bomb of July

311
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:52,489
humans can't do that computers can sorry guys I hate to break it to you that was a cover of

312
01:18:52,489 --> 01:19:24,260
Katy Perry firework okay that I'm covering that song am I did it qualify it was too close to the

313
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:38,899
original I'm gonna get flagged what do you what do you mean too close to the original if you put

314
01:19:38,899 --> 01:19:48,199
that next to the original song I bet you it was so bad that it probably wasn't even like 16 percent

315
01:19:48,199 --> 01:20:01,319
accurate so I don't know if I agree with that like you could run that through the fucking like

316
01:20:01,319 --> 01:20:05,239
lawsuit computer and it'd be like no no then let's hear that the sound what the sound songs like and

317
01:20:05,239 --> 01:20:11,270
what the singer sounds like okay that's what Katy Perry sounds like what does Terminator 5 sound

318
01:20:11,270 --> 01:20:17,289
like oh this is fucking awful this is not even close he might even be singing a different song

319
01:20:17,289 --> 01:20:29,500
he sucks so bad at this no no lawsuit dropped and he what team am I on blue

320
01:20:41,369 --> 01:21:02,920
don't take it from me that's mine at least I got it that's all it matters oh the DMT is kicking in

321
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:10,550
no not again all right impromptu for impromptu Katy Perry trying to do that note how was that

322
01:21:11,109 --> 01:21:27,420
out of 10 I want I need to know like a four what happens when it's all four

323
01:21:31,130 --> 01:21:44,260
overtime literally four to ten maybe something like that I wasn't paying attention we still want

324
01:21:44,260 --> 01:22:16,149
though all right why is it overtime again why are we getting overtime again if I had some practice

325
01:22:16,149 --> 01:22:21,819
I think I probably could do it if I sat in the mirror for like two weeks and did it I could

326
01:22:21,899 --> 01:22:39,399
probably come really close oh that's that's not this has been on the whole time I sang with this

327
01:22:39,399 --> 01:22:53,829
on didn't I I had this on I sang with that on I had a pitch shift down it was pitched down

328
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:12,340
it wasn't it had to be it was never on it had the dfx light was on it had to be on all right I need

329
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:49,109
to pay attention hold on fools you went at the wrong time I couldn't go I was gonna get pushed

330
01:23:49,109 --> 01:23:56,220
off if I had gone if I had gone when the first pass I would have got hit by the thing and knocked

331
01:23:56,220 --> 01:24:20,460
into you guys all want to laugh anyways well I want to hear this don't take it from me that's

332
01:24:21,340 --> 01:24:33,239

333
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:47,510
oh I admit can I play it is picture sit down a tiny bit

334
01:24:54,819 --> 01:25:14,229
that's pretty good that's what people were saying what's wrong with your mic

335
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:37,449
because it sounded like weird and a little lower and shitty now I get it the fourth of

336
01:25:37,449 --> 01:25:43,449
july part was good but then the firework was like I hit that when you push the horn too hard

337
01:25:43,449 --> 01:25:51,909
and it goes like you don't want to push the horn too hard just enough not over quit don't over

338
01:25:51,909 --> 01:26:23,819
squeeze the horn I can't even see the chat right now now I can shit shit shit shit shit weigh us

383
01:38:35,539 --> 01:38:41,380
Boneworks I want to do this like 10 new VR games that came out over the last six months and some

384
01:38:41,380 --> 01:38:48,090
stuff that I didn't even do I didn't even finish that I would like to I want to do tilt brush for

385
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:54,140
a little while that's been I was I did it for like 10 minutes one time I was flipper had an

386
01:38:54,140 --> 01:39:04,340
HDTV there's a lot to do yeah there's a ton of stuff to do so expect VR stuff soon I also want

387
01:39:04,340 --> 01:39:08,340
to bring this up too because this is important I brought this up in pre-stream chat but I want to

388
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:17,899
kind of make it people aware of it now as of today or last night this work has been started

389
01:39:18,779 --> 01:39:26,649
on a choose your own adventure custom-made game board that we are going to play on stream

390
01:39:27,210 --> 01:39:39,289
completely inspired by sorcery there's going to be a ton of things to do tons of choices trying

391
01:39:39,289 --> 01:39:43,449
to involve people that know kind of about that space and know how to use it and do things like

392
01:39:43,449 --> 01:39:51,060
that there's a couple of really good art that's all folks a couple of really good artists we're

393
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:56,260
going to be making the artwork for it you know I think you probably know both of them I would

394
01:39:56,260 --> 01:40:03,029
assume you know Ashley is going to be making artwork for it and uh John Silva Star is going

395
01:40:03,029 --> 01:40:13,319
to be the head game essentially maker or the board maker map maker it should be a lot of fun

396
01:40:13,399 --> 01:40:23,189
going to be completely custom-made just a sorcery like choose your own adventure game I'm also

397
01:40:23,189 --> 01:40:28,729
going to hit up some people about it um I want to talk to Arcadium about it because he knows a ton

398
01:40:28,729 --> 01:40:37,340
about this shit get a bunch of input from him because he obviously knows a lot about games

399
01:40:37,340 --> 01:40:50,390
like this so but my point is is that you may hear about people working on this project and I want

400
01:40:50,470 --> 01:40:57,560
you to hear it from the horse's mouth so you might see for instance if Star is talking about it or

401
01:40:57,560 --> 01:41:01,880
if um like John Silva's talking about it then I want you to be like wait oh well hold on what

402
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:13,100
are you talking about so it's a real thing as of yesterday that's the scariest way to hear anything

403
01:41:16,739 --> 01:41:24,779
general ETA before November that's kind of what we've decided Star is going to be doing a ton of

404
01:41:26,260 --> 01:41:31,640
encounter making and we're going to sit down on a few calls and go over what I really want to

405
01:41:31,720 --> 01:41:37,079
see and obviously he has a bunch of great ideas like everybody else does right but I want it to

406
01:41:37,079 --> 01:41:44,329
be a kind of a blind experience that you guys get to make choices too so imagine sorcery but

407
01:41:44,329 --> 01:41:52,859
it's completely custom-made about around sort of this community and you guys will be able to

408
01:41:52,859 --> 01:42:00,970
participate by voting on what paths we can go down sometimes so before November of this year

409
01:42:01,609 --> 01:42:12,710
is when it's supposed to happen I'll give you more updates when they come it should be a lot

410
01:42:12,710 --> 01:42:25,319
of fun it's official as of yesterday what's on Sunday I'll have to figure that out over the next

411
01:42:25,319 --> 01:42:37,399
few days there are a ton of options so October 31st then well maybe it could be I don't know

412
01:42:37,399 --> 01:42:44,680
I get we can't give a date but Star thinks that this could all be ready at some point

413
01:42:45,239 --> 01:42:53,960
either before November or just barely into November I'll figure it out though but I am

414
01:42:53,960 --> 01:43:00,199
gonna go I'm gonna run I'm gonna run away because I need to eat food I'll see you guys on Sunday

415
01:43:00,199 --> 01:43:07,239
we'll figure out what we're gonna do thanks for watching take care of yourselves have a great

416
01:43:07,239 --> 01:43:13,560
