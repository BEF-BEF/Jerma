1
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:07,660
I can't figure out. There's a song. I got a song caught in my head.

2
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,169
Ba ba ba ba ba. I can't figure out what the fuck it is.

3
00:00:13,189 --> 00:00:14,630
Like three days.

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:24,219
Hey, how you doing? Welcome to the stream everybody. Hey, how you doing?

5
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:26,620
Let's reset. Hey, how you doing?

6
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:32,820
Can we hear more than three notes? I don't know any of the other notes.

7
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:39,289
When is Strawberry Magic 2?

8
00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:43,500
You know, uh, you know that was made up.

9
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,219
People got my hopes up so bad.

10
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:55,770
There is no Strawberry Magic 2 guys. It doesn't exist. It's not real.

11
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,870
Yeah, it's not real. I tried looked for it.

12
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:16,569
But yeah, I'll give you the plan for the next uh, the next week here of streaming content.

13
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:23,459
It's kind of in pre-stream 30-40 minutes ago.

14
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,189
We came up with a little bit of a plan.

15
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:34,099
We're gonna play Wobble Dogs for now.

16
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:37,480
If the game's fun, then cool. We'll stick with it.

17
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,140
If after an hour or two, I'm like, meh, then we'll move on to the card game.

18
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:45,219
Mon...

19
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:47,700
Well, Mon Bozo? Mon Bozo?

20
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,950
If I think Wobble Dogs is a lot of fun, then we'll just do Mon Bozo

21
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,340
later this week.

22
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,340
Mon Bozo. I don't know how to say it.

23
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:03,980
Strawberry Magic 2 doesn't exist.

24
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,500
All the people coming in here. I know the last thing we did was Strawberry Magic.

25
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,939
It's fresh in everybody's mind. I know it's fresh in my mind too.

26
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,069
Because I had like three or four nightmares about it.

27
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:18,169
It's been fresh since

28
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:22,599
we did that stream.

29
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,840
Can you make a Civ 5 reference?

30
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:30,699
Um, I had never played any of the Civilization games.

31
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,539
Wait, that's not true. I downloaded Civ Rev

32
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,580
on iPad, I think, because it was the easy one.

33
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,379
And I didn't even make it through the tutorial.

34
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:45,990
I was just like, no, I don't care. I don't want to do this.

35
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,330
Now, let me move my mic. Give me a sec.

36
00:02:50,330 --> 00:03:06,199
Why does everybody keep saying Morbius?

37
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:10,099
What's, what's, what's the deal here? What's, what's Morbius?

38
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:12,979
Why are you saying, well, I know what Morbius is, but what do you, why do you keep saying it?

39
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,240
Is that the new thing now?

40
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,930
All right.

41
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,930
Would I like, oh!

42
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,620
Uh, my, my whole, my whole body's fucked up.

43
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,419
Okay. Uh, what I'd like you to do now,

44
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:34,139
I'd like you to move over to your calendar, whatever your calendar app of your choice is.

45
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,939
I'd like you to scroll over to July.

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,370
And I would like you to mark on your character sheet, on your July sheet.

47
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:51,370
I would like for you to mark July 14th for the baseball stream.

48
00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:54,520
July 14th is the baseball stream.

49
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,400
Don't have a time yet, but it'll be probably in the afternoon.

50
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:06,009
Here is your hard date. It is set in stone. It is not changing.

51
00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:13,000
Unless something, obviously, like, of course it could, but that's the date that we have picked.

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,960
That's what it's going to be.

53
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:20,600
What if it rains?

54
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,120
Well, I, oh my God, don't scare the shit out of me.

55
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,879
Why them, them were doing it in the rain.

56
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,959
They play baseball games in the rain all the time.

57
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,160
Networking Andy?

58
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,629
How, this is not Networking Andy.

59
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:38,389
You've known about this show for two years.

60
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:39,509
I just haven't been able to do it.

61
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:41,639
Hold on, I gotta clear my throat.

62
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:42,680
Give me a second.

63
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:53,579
I don't know what's going on.

64
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:55,980
My throat's so fucked up all the time.

65
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:02,540
But, yeah, uh, there's gonna be a lot of interesting stuff on that stream.

66
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,019
I think that stream's gonna be one of my most favorite streams ever.

67
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,300
I know I say that every time there's an event stream,

68
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,459
and I know that I sound like a fucking 80-year-old.

69
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:12,579
Hey, hey kids.

70
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:14,100
I know.

71
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,480
You know, they actually turn out that way.

72
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:17,959
It's weird.

73
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:27,259
Every show that I've done over the last, like, two years has been, like, my favorite stream.

74
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:27,740
So, I don't know.

75
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,100
We'll see if that trend continues.

76
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:40,360
I think it's gonna be fun.

77
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,120
But, yeah, that's, there's your date.

78
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:48,360
The German Baseball Association, July 14th.

79
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,000
Mark it again.

80
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:55,079
You sound like you've been taking non-stop bong rips.

81
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,160
I don't smoke weed.

82
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,920
I don't smoke it.

83
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,339
Don't get out of here.

84
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:12,699
Will the pencil be at German Baseball?

85
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:12,860
No.

86
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:17,430
Why on earth would the pencil show up at that stream?

87
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:22,199
I mean, I'm not gonna tell you what's gonna happen on that stream,

88
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,160
because I think it's gonna be fun.

89
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,019
You already know some of it.

90
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:29,420
But, uh, as, oh, as Oski had to say, he had hype.

91
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:34,889
Is barf drinker gonna be there?

92
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:45,910
I saw you at MGM Grand yesterday.

93
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:46,550
No, you did not.

94
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,399
I'm just telling you, you didn't.

95
00:06:49,959 --> 00:07:00,970
Will the stream be at 420?

96
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:01,209
No.

97
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:05,019
Are you gonna get big poppy?

98
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,220
No.

99
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,139
Now, all right, that's, what was the announcement?

100
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,180
We're not talking about anything.

101
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:12,899
Any details?

102
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:16,410
Let's move over here and let's play Wobble Dogs.

103
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,449
That's what they're starting with today.

104
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:20,819
I promise my voice will get better.

105
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:22,579
If it doesn't, then it's over.

106
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:27,899
I don't get it.

107
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,399
But, let's go.

108
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,939
Yeah, hope you're doing well.

109
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:33,819
Hope things are going good.

110
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:35,860
Move over here.

111
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,500
Uh, this is, I don't even know what the hell this game is.

112
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:43,300
I know it's a game where you have, you take care of dogs and they wobble around.

113
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:45,079
Is it?

114
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:45,959
I just read the title.

115
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,730
I read the title of the book and then went to the book club and pretended that I read the book.

116
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:55,160
That was always the worst fucking thing, by the way.

117
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:01,500
Can I just real quickly say how many, it's been a long time since I've been in high school

118
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:07,100
or college or whatever, but I do remember specifically getting the reading, the reading

119
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:14,470
assignment and it was like, okay, we're going to go from page, uh, page, uh, one 50 to one 90.

120
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:17,110
And we're going to have a class discussion about it tomorrow.

121
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,269
Right.

122
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:23,779
And we're just not reading it and then having to have the teacher be like, okay, so

123
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,379
when this happened, what do you think was really going through their mind?

124
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:28,660
Explain that.

125
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,540
What do you think happened there?

126
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,379
Whatever the thing was.

127
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:35,019
And yeah, somebody said it, but I'm going to reiterate it.

128
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:40,059
I would pick up clues from what I, if you were the first to get called, it's over.

129
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,259
You're fucked.

130
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:41,899
Right.

131
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:47,500
Because then you have to be like, um, well, I, uh, I, uh, my hamster needed it.

132
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,460
I didn't take care of my hamster a lot and then, and I didn't read it.

133
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:57,620
But if two or three people went before you, you could kind of pick up the Wikipedia article

134
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:02,820
of what happened in those 30 pages and then just kind of go for it and be like, well, you know,

135
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:11,429
I do think when, when Lenny showed up and I've might have been, and I, I'll tell you right now

136
00:09:11,429 --> 00:09:18,389
that story, uh, in the, in the barn and when he was, uh, picking the hay up, I think it went,

137
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:27,559
spoke to what a society in general and how we can handle things and spark notes, dude,

138
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:29,159
I've wrote, I'm not kidding.

139
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:31,320
This, don't take this as like a thing you should do.

140
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,759
Don't be a idiot like I am.

141
00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:37,269
I think I've wrote an entire paper of a book I didn't read before.

142
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:42,389
I did not read the book at all and I wrote a whole paper about it.

143
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:45,990
And I didn't even like read the cliff notes or spark notes or whatever.

144
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:51,590
I just wrote a paper about just, it was just a bunch of vague shit that I said about the book.

145
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:57,659
I got a D, but I passed it.

146
00:09:57,659 --> 00:09:59,820
I got a D on that, it was like a D plus.

147
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:04,919
And there was a shit load of red ink circled being like, what do you mean by this?

148
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:10,149
I think the teacher might've like felt bad that like I just couldn't,

149
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:11,590
I didn't fucking get it or something.

150
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:18,789
But I wrote an entire paper, like a, like an eight to 10 page paper on a book I did not read.

151
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:21,059
Don't fucking do that.

152
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:21,860
Don't be an idiot.

153
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,340
Like that, that take that stuff seriously.

154
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:28,870
But to be fair, the stuff that in school that I did take seriously that I cared about,

155
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,990
I took very seriously.

156
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,149
Eight to 10.

157
00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:40,440
I was just like a vague kind of anecdotal random stuff about like how I felt about the book.

158
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,929
What classes did you take seriously?

159
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:47,049
I thought science was really cool.

160
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,129
I always paid attention in science.

161
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,009
Math?

162
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:53,610
No, I couldn't do it.

163
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:54,649
I was, I just couldn't do it.

164
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,110
I did enough where I could pass the classes and like, you know, whatever, do the worksheets

165
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:03,429
and try to get at least like pass in grade plus C whatever on the test, whatever.

166
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,990
But I was, I loved science.

167
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,580
I was, I thought it was great.

168
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:10,629
Bat chest.

169
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,059
Don't bat chest me because I like science.

170
00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:16,700
I, that's not, okay, it's fine.

171
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:20,490
Oh, I love science.

172
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:21,129
Bat chest.

173
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:25,820
All right.

174
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,220
All right.

175
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:26,539
All right.

176
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:28,860
Okay.

177
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,190
We're gonna play Wobble Dogs.

178
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:36,759
Um, what else did I like in high school?

179
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:41,830
I thought, uh, you know what?

180
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:42,789
I liked logic.

181
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:43,909
I thought logic was really cool.

182
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:49,190
Like if, then, therefore, it was like a math problem with language, with words.

183
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,629
It was really actually kind of cool.

184
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:51,750
Logic was actually really cool.

185
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,950
If you have an opportunity to take, and I'm not fucking around.

186
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:55,750
This is not a joke.

187
00:11:56,309 --> 00:11:59,429
If you're in high school or if you're going into college or if you're in college right now,

188
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,730
if logic is available, take it.

189
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:03,769
It's really cool.

190
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:14,389
It's, it's called logic and it's based on, it's like a math problem with words.

191
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:18,409
I loved it.

192
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:21,370
No, not logitech.

193
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,370
That's just philosophy.

194
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:31,960
No, but it's, it's like a math problem version of like, just look it up.

195
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,080
Just look up like logic class or logic math.

196
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,879
You'll see.

197
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,000
It's really interesting.

198
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,279
Please take it if you have an opportunity.

199
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,720
It'll, it'll open your mind, if it will.

200
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:42,740
I hecking love logitech.

201
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:45,929
Why did I just read that?

202
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:47,289
Because I thought, whatever.

203
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:50,090
I actually, besides, I'm not gonna, don't say anything.

204
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,830
I, shut up, everybody, quiet.

205
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:01,019
I actually, that company that makes some pretty good stuff.

206
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:02,139
I've used it before.

207
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,460
Except the, the webcams I have a problem with.

208
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,100
But that's it.

209
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,460
I only have a problem with their webcams.

210
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:08,820
That's it.

211
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,799
Just everybody relax.

212
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,230
That's programming?

213
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,179
No, no, no, no, no, no.

214
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:18,419
Hold on.

215
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:19,220
Let me get an example.

216
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:21,620
Like a logic example.

217
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,100
Logic class example.

218
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,860
We're learning today.

219
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,250
Crash course in formal logic.

220
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,549
Logic 101, introduction.

221
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:35,350
Introduction to logic.

222
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,710
Yeah, just fucking go learn.

223
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:39,029
I don't, just turn, turn the stream off right now.

224
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:40,419
I'm not doing it.

225
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:41,539
Just go learn yourself.

226
00:13:41,539 --> 00:13:42,100
It's interesting.

227
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:45,460
It's like if, that's, then for, then why.

228
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,299
It's, it's like a programming math language problem.

229
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:50,259
Just go read.

230
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:51,139
Go fucking learn.

231
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,259
Don't come here.

232
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:53,299
I'm playing a dog game.

233
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,259
You shouldn't even be here right now.

234
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:55,379
You should be in fucking school.

235
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,269
What time is it?

236
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:05,830
You should be studying for tomorrow's exam.

237
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:06,309
My name is...

238
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:14,340
I don't know.

239
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,860
I don't even like using my name.

240
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,389
I'm 36, dude.

241
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:19,269
I don't have exams.

242
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:22,389
Yeah, but just trust me.

243
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:23,190
Take a logic class.

244
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,470
I know people will be like, oh my God.

245
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,629
I like the logic bad chest Andy.

246
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:27,350
Whatever.

247
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:27,750
It's cool.

248
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,070
How about macho?

249
00:14:30,789 --> 00:14:33,129
All right.

250
00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:33,850
So how does this game work?

251
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,440
Welcome to Wobble Dogs.

252
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,440
This is a sandbox game where you can raise your own little hive of mutated pups.

253
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:50,840
Let's go over a few basic concepts before we turn you loose.

254
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,419
Let's go ahead and get you with a dog to play with.

255
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:56,179
I gotta move the can.

256
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,730
My dog's name is Mingle.

257
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:00,009
Fresh dog.

258
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:05,179
Hold on.

259
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:05,659
Dog.

260
00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:06,379
Buddy.

261
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:06,700
Stub.

262
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,100
Do we need to...

263
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:07,259
Oh no.

264
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:07,580
We gotta...

265
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,220
Come on.

266
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,139
Bandit.

267
00:15:11,139 --> 00:15:13,340
Congratulations on your new pup.

268
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:16,779
Now that you have got a dog, let's learn about the dog storage screen.

269
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:22,659
This gives you an overview of all the dogs you own and lets you choose which ones are

270
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:23,940
in the world at any given time.

271
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:29,740
If a dog ever accidentally ends up being removed from the world, this is where it'll end up.

272
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,700
Okay, so I have like a dog storage.

273
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:37,080
How come there's no auto-emote?

274
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,580
I think there is.

275
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:43,879
If being born is hungry work, build a food dispenser and use it to feed your new pup.

276
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:46,230
Classic food dispenser.

277
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:46,789
All right.

278
00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:49,769
Build.

279
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:56,179
You guys gotta love this game.

280
00:15:56,179 --> 00:15:56,980
I already know it.

281
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,240
Okay, so this is...

282
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,039
You gotta go to the fence.

283
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:03,029
Feed your dog's a healthy treat.

284
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:04,629
Where should I put it?

285
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:08,070
Are we in the corner here?

286
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,740
Does this cost money or is it just free?

287
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:15,340
Your dog will try to feed itself, but if you click on a piece of food,

288
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,940
you can command your dog to eat it.

289
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,659
You can also grab things to drag them around.

290
00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:23,539
Use the scroll wheel or hold control to drag them vertically.

291
00:16:23,539 --> 00:16:24,179
Okay.

292
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:26,620
Feed your dog.

293
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,590
So it's kind of...

294
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,629
This is like The Sims.

295
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:33,429
Get over there.

296
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:38,570
Nutritional pellet of burrito?

297
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,450
French fries?

298
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,580
What?

299
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,740
Dogs love to munch on this nutritious pellet.

300
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,820
Looks like someone's already taken a bite.

301
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:49,500
Wait, you get it?

302
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,110
Press the button.

303
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:57,500
This dog's eating burritos.

304
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,139
It looks like your pup's ready to pupate.

305
00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:03,370
Press the pupate?

306
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,750
Also, if you haven't figured it out yet, you have to move the camera.

307
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:09,559
Help your dog pupate.

308
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:11,160
How do I get rid of this?

309
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:16,279
Oh, I gotta get rid of this.

310
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:17,480
Uh, are you all right?

311
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,630
What happened?

312
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,190
What is going on?

313
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,589
Why does he have a burrito in his mouth?

314
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:25,430
I had two burritos?

315
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:33,079
Okay, how do I pupate?

316
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:35,319
Not flora field guide?

317
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:38,069
What the fuck?

318
00:17:38,069 --> 00:17:43,720
Standard flora found in nearly all dog-based life forms.

319
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,640
Beneficial flora often used to help acclimate dogs to cold weather climates.

320
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:54,309
Oh, I get this from eating a burrito?

321
00:17:54,309 --> 00:17:55,190
All right, enough.

322
00:17:55,190 --> 00:18:00,839
This dog is fucked up.

323
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:02,680
Okay, well, how do I pupate?

324
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,119
Help your dog pupate.

325
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:08,460
Okay, pupate.

326
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:08,859
What?

327
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:18,809
This is weird.

328
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:23,079
Oh, not on the burrito.

329
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:24,039
Don't eat those.

330
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:26,460
Ugh.

331
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,400
This is kind of gross.

332
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,700
Okay, mutations.

333
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,990
Back leg stance width.

334
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:46,900
Body girth went up and nose and ear gloss went up a lot.

335
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,539
All right.

336
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:52,650
Dogs pupate several times throughout their lives.

337
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,890
The foods they eat will influence their mutations.

338
00:18:54,890 --> 00:19:00,839
Let's have you build an incubator that you hatch fertilized dog eggs.

339
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:01,640
Don't eat that.

340
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,779
Oh, something's wrong.

341
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:06,740
He's freaking out.

342
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:11,099
Okay, incubator.

343
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:14,220
He like ate his casing and is losing his mind.

344
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,059
Okay, incubator.

345
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:23,849
What's over here?

346
00:19:23,849 --> 00:19:25,769
Even though you don't own any fertilized dog eggs,

347
00:19:25,769 --> 00:19:30,099
the incubator always lets you hatch a dog with default genetics.

348
00:19:30,099 --> 00:19:31,460
How do I clean shit up here?

349
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,200
Oh, there we go.

350
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:40,059
This thing, this burrito, is this burrito like dirty?

351
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:42,220
Okay, well, let's have a fertilized egg.

352
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:46,359
What is going on here?

353
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,579
This is, oh, this is Bandit's gut.

354
00:19:48,579 --> 00:19:51,859
This is weird.

355
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:54,970
Okay, so hatch this egg.

356
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:55,690
Here's another dog.

357
00:19:56,619 --> 00:19:57,259
I like mud.

358
00:19:57,259 --> 00:19:58,869
Mud's great already.

359
00:19:58,869 --> 00:19:59,750
If you're holding an object,

360
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,910
you can press the delete key on your keyboard to destroy it.

361
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:02,309
Thank you.

362
00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:05,130
This works on dogs too, but don't worry, they'll be okay.

363
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,430
Last up, don't forget to save often.

364
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:10,150
The game only autosaves when you travel to breeding mode.

365
00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:11,900
Breeding mode.

366
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:16,730
Lay around and have fun.

367
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:21,140
God, okay.

368
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,059
So let's, let's, let's, you want a burrito?

369
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:26,680
No, I don't want you to eat a burrito.

370
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:30,099
I want like a nutritional, French fries.

371
00:20:30,099 --> 00:20:39,000
Go eat a French fry.

372
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,980
Here, try this.

373
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,619
Eat that.

374
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:52,819
Eat that French fry.

375
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:56,700
Eat this.

376
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,819
Go eat the French fry.

377
00:20:57,819 --> 00:20:58,859
What are you, stupid?

378
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:04,339
Where are you going?

379
00:21:04,339 --> 00:21:06,650
Oh, he's not hungry.

380
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:11,160
If you press that button, I'm going to be very upset.

381
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,430
Oh wait, here comes Bandit.

382
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:16,170
Bandit's going to eat the French fry.

383
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:23,160
Are you going to eat the French fry?

384
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,500
Okay, so that changed your gut flora.

385
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:33,779
Oh, let's, um, good, good dog.

386
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:36,259
Click mud, then eat French fry.

387
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:37,140
I don't think they really need it.

388
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,339
All right, what about, uh, what's this?

389
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:41,859
Currences.

390
00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:43,619
A flora found in cocoon drippings.

391
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:44,660
So what does this do?

392
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,579
I don't know.

393
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:47,700
It doesn't, I don't know yet.

394
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:53,990
But it turns dogs into like French fries?

395
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:57,670
Default collaboration.

396
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,029
This, this is like, unlocks a ton of shit.

397
00:21:59,029 --> 00:22:00,150
This is like, kind of seems ridiculous.

398
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,509
All right.

399
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:05,299
Oh, do I get more dogs?

400
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:08,730
All right, you come over here.

401
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,359
Okay, I thought someone's going to eat it.

402
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:13,720
I was like, someone's going to eat that immediately.

403
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,240
That's, I don't know why they freaked me out.

404
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,079
What do I do with this?

405
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,119
It is edible, by the way.

406
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,779
Randy is waiting for you in storage.

407
00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:34,170
And you get, you can feed with chicken nuggets now.

408
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:35,289
All right, let's go get Randy.

409
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:42,789
What the fuck is that?

410
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:45,210
Okay.

411
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:49,559
Oh, that's funny.

412
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,440
It's like, I don't know what the fuck that was.

413
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,049
That's genetic code?

414
00:22:55,049 --> 00:22:56,089
Oh, release, spring out.

415
00:22:56,089 --> 00:22:56,569
Okay.

416
00:22:56,569 --> 00:22:58,599
It's DNA?

417
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,660
Hey, hey, why is it blood?

418
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:08,579
Okay, for a second, I thought Bandit was fucking eating mud.

419
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:10,460
What does this do?

420
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,019
Hey, stop that.

421
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:13,819
Stop doing that.

422
00:23:13,819 --> 00:23:14,859
Please don't do that.

423
00:23:14,859 --> 00:23:15,500
What was that?

424
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,539
That was weird.

425
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:23,980
Okay, relax.

426
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,440
Randy, sit.

427
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,680
I'm trying my best to sit.

428
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,480
Very good.

429
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,440
Very, very good.

430
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,319
Good dog.

431
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:39,900
So what can I do with the dirt?

432
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,180
Anybody want a burrito?

433
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,750
Just shit on an egg?

434
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,299
There's a dog egg in here.

435
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:58,710
Why is there, what happened?

436
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,940
Looks like you found an unfertilized egg.

437
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:04,700
You can use the breeding simulation to inject these with dog genes.

438
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:14,440
Just breed any two of your adult dogs

439
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,759
and inject the resultant genes into an egg.

440
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:19,000
Afterwards, you can hatch this egg and use the incubator.

441
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,599
Okay.

442
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,180
Okay.

443
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:38,789
So Randy and Bandit.

444
00:24:38,789 --> 00:24:40,950
Are you sure you'd like to breed the selected dogs

445
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:43,109
and immediately remove an egg from your inventory?

446
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:50,599
Yeah.

447
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:51,160
What?

448
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,039
Crossbreed or select final dog?

449
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:56,069
I don't know.

450
00:24:58,069 --> 00:24:58,470
I don't get it.

451
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:58,869
What do I do?

452
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:04,019
Should I select final?

453
00:25:04,579 --> 00:25:05,779
Just crossbreed them.

454
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,980
I don't know who's, I don't know who's got,

455
00:25:12,019 --> 00:25:13,380
they're all like, look, what do I do?

456
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,460
Dog A and dog B.

457
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:19,079
What is happening?

458
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,640
Whoa.

459
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,230
Oh, they do have different eyes and mouths and stuff.

460
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:34,490
You're right.

461
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:34,809
All right.

462
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:39,910
Crossbreed you and one that's really jumping around.

463
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:44,900
Holy shit.

464
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,579
That, that, I want this one jumps.

465
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:49,940
Okay.

466
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,940
We got to, okay, final dog here.

467
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,130
What do we want?

468
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:58,200
Who has the most energy?

469
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,880
Is that, should we not have the dog with the most energy?

470
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,230
Keep going?

471
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:14,549
I want the dog with, all right, one more and that's it.

472
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,140
You, you can stand.

473
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:19,700
Holy shit.

474
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,180
Look at that.

475
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:20,660
Look at this.

476
00:26:25,529 --> 00:26:25,849
All right.

477
00:26:25,849 --> 00:26:26,170
All right.

478
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:26,410
All right.

479
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:26,650
All right.

480
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:26,890
All right.

481
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:27,210
That's enough.

482
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,089
That's enough.

483
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:28,490
This one.

484
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,329
It's like final dog.

485
00:26:30,329 --> 00:26:31,289
It's going to pick one from here.

486
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:36,039
That was pretty sick.

487
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,519
Can anybody else do anything like that?

488
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:43,369
No, I think it's going to be you.

489
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:02,410
Rune generation complete.

490
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:05,339
The hell is going on in this game?

491
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:08,390
That's got like a Mega Man password.

492
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:32,200
This is a very elaborate thing going on.

493
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:45,450
Hey, holy shit.

494
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,809
This is like kind of terrible.

495
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:50,599
This is so scary.

496
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,390
Okay.

497
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,750
Fertilized egg acquired.

498
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:59,450
It's like weird sacrifice.

499
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:01,029
All right.

500
00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:03,019
Dig a hole.

501
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:04,059
I get weed mix.

502
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:07,430
Egg novice.

503
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,630
I get cloud wallpaper.

504
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:08,869
Sick.

505
00:28:09,509 --> 00:28:10,950
We need a pair of dogs for the first time.

506
00:28:11,509 --> 00:28:12,150
I get another day.

507
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:12,869
I got another dog egg.

508
00:28:12,869 --> 00:28:13,029
All right.

509
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:13,750
We're going to hold on to that.

510
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,119
I don't want to use that right now.

511
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:20,299
Wait, I can plant a seed in here.

512
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:22,329
Seed packets.

513
00:28:22,329 --> 00:28:22,650
Let's go.

514
00:28:23,819 --> 00:28:24,299
Oh shit.

515
00:28:27,509 --> 00:28:28,470
Outdoor flooring.

516
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:31,960
All right.

517
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,279
Okay.

518
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:32,440
Okay.

519
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:32,519
Okay.

520
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:33,000
What is this?

521
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:37,430
Give me this.

522
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,940
Where'd you get this?

523
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,500
There's a prize inside?

524
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,109
Somebody come get this.

525
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,250
Hey, mud.

526
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,380
Come go over here and get this.

527
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:48,940
Where's mud?

528
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:50,900
They're getting hungry.

529
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,140
All right.

530
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:51,940
Mud, mud, mud.

531
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:52,339
Open that.

532
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,960
Star hologram?

533
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,680
I have to get it.

534
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:58,920
Oh.

535
00:29:01,769 --> 00:29:03,210
Mud's going for the burrito.

536
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:03,930
Perfect.

537
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:13,339
Where's our other dog?

538
00:29:13,339 --> 00:29:22,730
Oh, here we go.

539
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:26,359
Loot box.

540
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:27,940
Hey, don't fight.

541
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:28,740
What was that?

542
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:32,950
All right.

543
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,789
I got to feed some chicken nuggets

544
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:38,250
because that'll give us more DNA, right?

545
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,049
Look at mud.

546
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:39,849
You're so cute.

547
00:29:39,849 --> 00:29:44,619
I'm getting just achievements every five seconds here.

548
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:44,859
All right.

549
00:29:44,859 --> 00:29:46,700
I get blue blanket flowers.

550
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:50,259
Is this ready?

551
00:29:50,259 --> 00:29:50,900
All right.

552
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,519
There's the dog with the square eye.

553
00:29:54,839 --> 00:30:02,740
Um, how about squarie?

554
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,539
Squarie.

555
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:11,099
You got a lot of flowers here.

556
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:11,339
Okay.

557
00:30:11,339 --> 00:30:11,900
All right.

558
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,180
Let me, I got to clean this place up a little bit.

559
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,859
This place is kind of a fucking dump.

560
00:30:15,859 --> 00:30:17,400
Okay.

561
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,240
Loves to make loud noise.

562
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,839
The very picture of consideration.

563
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:23,259
Just wonderful, polite and aloof.

564
00:30:23,259 --> 00:30:25,640
Who's the one we just, we just came up with?

565
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:25,880
Okay.

566
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:28,869
Squarie.

567
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:29,109
All right.

568
00:30:29,109 --> 00:30:29,430
Stop.

569
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:30,150
Are you going to dig?

570
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,349
Are you going to bury the burrito?

571
00:30:31,349 --> 00:30:32,630
This is going to be the cutest thing I've ever seen.

572
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:33,829
If you, if you bury the burrito,

573
00:30:33,829 --> 00:30:35,299
then you're my favorite.

574
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:36,180
Bury the burrito.

575
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:36,740
Do it.

576
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,420
Come on.

577
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,539
Bury the burrito.

578
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:45,609
Hey, that's not bad.

579
00:30:45,609 --> 00:30:46,650
That's not yours.

580
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:47,980
That's not yours.

581
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,619
Stop it.

582
00:30:48,619 --> 00:30:49,960
Hey.

583
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,259
Bandit.

584
00:30:54,259 --> 00:30:55,690
Sit down.

585
00:30:55,690 --> 00:31:00,470
Bandit, sit.

586
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,029
All right.

587
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:01,589
People are hungry.

588
00:31:01,589 --> 00:31:01,829
Let's dig.

589
00:31:01,829 --> 00:31:03,269
Let's get some chicken nuggets.

590
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:08,779
Chicken nuggets and nutritional pellet.

591
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:10,470
All right.

592
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,509
Come get the food.

593
00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:19,980
Food's here.

594
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:24,460
The mouse sensitivity is really high.

595
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,180
I'm sorry.

596
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,869
All right.

597
00:31:26,869 --> 00:31:27,509
Come eat.

598
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:31,240
No, don't pupate yet.

599
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,380
How come nobody's eating?

600
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:41,079
Oh, somebody took a bite out of this one.

601
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:45,339
This reminds me of a viva pinata,

602
00:31:45,339 --> 00:31:47,259
but I kind of feel like there's more I can do.

603
00:31:47,259 --> 00:31:48,819
At least in an immediate sense.

604
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:50,940
All right.

605
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,980
Go to get off.

606
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:55,690
But I don't know what they're doing.

607
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:56,569
All right.

608
00:31:56,569 --> 00:31:57,289
Go pupate.

609
00:31:57,289 --> 00:31:57,609
Wait.

610
00:31:57,609 --> 00:31:58,410
You need to sleep.

611
00:31:58,410 --> 00:31:59,450
Go to sleep first.

612
00:31:59,450 --> 00:31:59,990
Go.

613
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:00,710
How do you make the dog?

614
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,230
How do you have the dog sleep?

615
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,450
I need a dog bed.

616
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:07,289
Where's this?

617
00:32:07,289 --> 00:32:07,529
OK.

618
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:08,410
I need dog beds.

619
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:13,769
Decorations.

620
00:32:13,769 --> 00:32:14,089
OK.

621
00:32:14,089 --> 00:32:15,049
A star hologram.

622
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:16,809
Can go over here because it's kind of cool looking, I guess.

623
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:18,500
Toys.

624
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,849
Utilities.

625
00:32:19,849 --> 00:32:20,410
Walls.

626
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:21,289
Where's a bed?

627
00:32:21,289 --> 00:32:26,599
I like that.

628
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:32,470
How do I get a bed?

629
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:32,789
Whoa.

630
00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:33,430
That was weird.

631
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:33,829
What?

632
00:32:33,829 --> 00:32:35,029
Did I just delete everything?

633
00:32:35,029 --> 00:32:35,990
I think I just deleted everything.

634
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:36,630
What happened?

635
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:37,990
Did I delete the game?

636
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:38,230
No.

637
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:39,029
I was like, holy shit.

638
00:32:39,029 --> 00:32:39,910
What just happened?

639
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:42,869
OK.

640
00:32:42,869 --> 00:32:47,930
How do I get out of this menu?

641
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:48,890
Cleaning time.

642
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:51,500
Oh, play pillow.

643
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,049
OK.

644
00:32:53,049 --> 00:32:53,450
There you go.

645
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:54,089
Now you're sleeping.

646
00:32:54,089 --> 00:32:54,650
All right.

647
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:55,289
You guys need to eat.

648
00:32:55,289 --> 00:32:56,089
Who needs to eat?

649
00:32:56,089 --> 00:32:56,650
Randy.

650
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:00,059
Eat this chicken nugget.

651
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:00,700
Bandit.

652
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,819
Eat this chicken nugget.

653
00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:04,500
Squarrie.

654
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,460
Eat this pellet.

655
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,170
And then everybody go to bed.

656
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:12,309
There's another egg, too.

657
00:33:12,309 --> 00:33:14,150
Yeah, I don't want to fertilize it yet until I...

658
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:20,549
I know you want to pupate so bad, but is that bad that you're mutate?

659
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:24,869
Oh, shit.

660
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:25,430
OK.

661
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:30,039
Just don't eat dirt.

662
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:31,240
Eat the chicken nugget that I gave you.

663
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:37,000
Why are you eating dirt?

664
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,400
Thank you.

665
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:37,640
All right.

666
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:37,880
Finally.

667
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,440
Here we go.

668
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:43,480
This place is a fucking mess.

669
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:49,109
I got to clean this place up.

670
00:33:49,109 --> 00:33:49,910
OK.

671
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:52,470
So now maybe I'll be able to make another dog.

672
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,059
Oh, there's another egg.

673
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:54,299
OK.

674
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:57,059
Collect it.

675
00:33:57,059 --> 00:34:01,240
Which of you hasn't eaten?

676
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:01,960
Randy.

677
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,319
Randy, you need to eat something.

678
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:03,480
Eat...

679
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,410
What do you like?

680
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:09,050
Energy easily forms positive connections with other dogs.

681
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:09,210
All right.

682
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:09,769
Just eat the burrito.

683
00:34:09,769 --> 00:34:10,739
That's fine.

684
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:11,780
But eat something else, too.

685
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:15,530
You like a chicken nugget or something.

686
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,769
I'm trying my best to eat the chicken nugget.

687
00:34:17,769 --> 00:34:22,280
OK.

688
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:22,679
This place...

689
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,559
This is a fucking mess.

690
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:24,199
Come on.

691
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:26,820
Do I have to water the plants?

692
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,659
Breed this.

693
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:29,539
Pet them with shift.

694
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:37,159
Oh, you can pet them.

695
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:37,880
Food.

696
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:49,099
Look at all these good dogs.

697
00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:49,420
OK.

698
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,820
So you need to sleep.

699
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:55,340
Everyone's fed.

700
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,460
What is this?

701
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:56,619
OK.

702
00:34:56,619 --> 00:34:57,260
There we go.

703
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:57,579
Hatch.

704
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:04,619
OK.

705
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:08,179
The body color changed a little.

706
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,739
Head size got bigger.

707
00:35:11,739 --> 00:35:12,219
OK.

708
00:35:12,219 --> 00:35:13,179
That's fine.

709
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:15,559
Yeah.

710
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:16,440
I don't want people eating this.

711
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,320
Get rid of this.

712
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:22,579
You're eating the flowers or are you peeing on the flowers?

713
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:26,329
Achievements.

714
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,559
Ham.

715
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:35,019
Hatch or mutate a dog with a very large head.

716
00:35:35,019 --> 00:35:35,579
Phonograph.

717
00:35:36,699 --> 00:35:38,579
All right.

718
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:38,980
Should I go?

719
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:39,460
Should I do some...

720
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,300
Oh, you want a pupae, too.

721
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:41,539
All right.

722
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:42,019
Go for it.

723
00:35:42,019 --> 00:35:45,849
Let them sleep.

724
00:35:46,489 --> 00:35:50,230
What's this one do?

725
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:54,260
This is from chicken nuggets.

726
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,219
Big brain dog.

727
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:00,630
My throat.

728
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:00,869
OK.

729
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:01,750
I have an egg.

730
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:02,070
I could...

731
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:02,869
Should I...

732
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:06,519
Oh, let's put that out here.

733
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:08,059
Foam ham.

734
00:36:08,059 --> 00:36:08,539
Yeah, fine.

735
00:36:08,539 --> 00:36:09,500
Somebody play with that.

736
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,639
Save the game.

737
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,550
OK.

738
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:21,980
We're good.

739
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:22,539
Fine.

740
00:36:22,539 --> 00:36:24,170
Yeah, I'm fine.

741
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:24,409
All right.

742
00:36:24,409 --> 00:36:28,179
Let's give her the dirt.

743
00:36:28,179 --> 00:36:28,820
All right.

744
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:38,360
Come sleep in here.

745
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,360
Oh, a halved tree.

746
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,210
All right.

747
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:43,849
What do you got?

748
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:50,260
Squire is now...

749
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:54,469
Oh, he has a small head now.

750
00:36:54,469 --> 00:36:55,190
OK.

751
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,949
Ears color is changing.

752
00:36:56,949 --> 00:37:00,500
Front leg girth.

753
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,380
Body length.

754
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,559
His head is...

755
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:03,719
OK.

756
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:04,920
He got a little smaller.

757
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,880
Small brain.

758
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:09,050
Don't touch that.

759
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:11,849
Seriously, don't touch that.

760
00:37:11,849 --> 00:37:12,409
No.

761
00:37:12,409 --> 00:37:13,690
You need something healthy.

762
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:17,099
First of all, go like...

763
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:18,300
Go sleep in there.

764
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,960
Everyone's happy.

765
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,199
Good.

766
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:20,360
All right.

767
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,239
Who wants to play with this?

768
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:21,480
All right.

769
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:29,610
Delete this.

770
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:31,449
All right.

771
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:33,130
Let's make another one.

772
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,090
Let's do some breeding.

773
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:38,199
Where's the breeding menu?

774
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:42,440
How do I do that?

775
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:42,840
Oh, right here.

776
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,400
OK.

777
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:43,639
All right.

778
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:43,960
Here we go.

779
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,519
Ready?

780
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:49,820
Not old enough.

781
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,869
Oh, shit.

782
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:51,110
OK.

783
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:51,670
Never mind.

784
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:59,050
Try to make an abomination.

785
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,170
Oh, I want that.

786
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:03,769
Definitely.

787
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,880
Let's pet everybody first.

788
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,059
I want everyone to be happy.

789
00:38:11,059 --> 00:38:17,780
OK.

790
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,420
Good.

791
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,119
Where's...

792
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:22,920
Oh, you're over here.

793
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,559
OK.

794
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:24,860
You're sleeping.

795
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:25,659
Is everybody hungry?

796
00:38:25,659 --> 00:38:29,059
It's still french fries if somebody eat.

797
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:32,949
Make the ball pit.

798
00:38:32,949 --> 00:38:33,590
Let me...

799
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:38,409
That's a little too much.

800
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,070
I like the clouds the most.

801
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:42,710
Clouds are the best.

802
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:47,050
I like that.

803
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:47,690
That's cool.

804
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:52,500
Maybe put a tree here so they can pee on it.

805
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:59,380
What about the phonograph?

806
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:04,920
I have more than one feeding thing.

807
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,480
What's going on?

808
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,219
Stop.

809
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:06,619
Stop it.

810
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:08,710
Hey.

811
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,070
There's dirt everywhere.

812
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:10,789
You can have...

813
00:39:10,789 --> 00:39:11,510
All right.

814
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,489
Put it down.

815
00:39:12,489 --> 00:39:13,130
Hey.

816
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:13,690
Look.

817
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:14,650
I have dirt right here.

818
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:15,639
See?

819
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:18,090
There's more than one.

820
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:19,260
Randy.

821
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:19,820
Look.

822
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:23,210
There's more than one dirt pellet.

823
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:23,769
Right here.

824
00:39:23,769 --> 00:39:26,150
Go grab it.

825
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:26,710
See?

826
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:31,190
There's more than one.

827
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,550
Boy story Andy.

828
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,190
Please.

829
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:34,699
OK.

830
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,789
What should I feed?

831
00:39:38,789 --> 00:39:43,289
Another chicken nugget?

832
00:39:43,289 --> 00:39:44,250
I got to move this.

833
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,769
This is the shittiest spot.

834
00:39:45,769 --> 00:39:46,969
I got to move that.

835
00:39:46,969 --> 00:39:55,190
OK.

836
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:55,590
That's better.

837
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,670
Now I can actually collect the damn thing.

838
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:03,449
What the fuck was that?

839
00:40:03,449 --> 00:40:04,090
You all right?

840
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:04,630
OK.

841
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:05,190
We're good.

842
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:09,940
Oh.

843
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,900
You're going for the chicken nugget.

844
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,949
This is a squary.

845
00:40:14,949 --> 00:40:19,239
It's still a juvenile.

846
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:21,860
You like it?

847
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:25,590
You like it?

848
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:30,469
Like more seeds?

849
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:32,170
Yeah.

850
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:33,610
I don't want them to be all over the place though.

851
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:34,250
Like, OK.

852
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:34,889
You...

853
00:40:34,889 --> 00:40:37,190
Let's put them like over here.

854
00:40:37,829 --> 00:40:39,429
This dirt patch is so fucked up.

855
00:40:39,429 --> 00:40:40,150
I don't want this.

856
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:40,789
It's kind of ugly.

857
00:40:42,699 --> 00:40:42,860
All right.

858
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,820
I'm going to plant the...

859
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,929
How do I get rid of this?

860
00:40:45,929 --> 00:40:53,079
This is a squid game room.

861
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:54,519
It's not a squid.

862
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:54,840
It's...

863
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,280
This is not squid game.

864
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,710
OK.

865
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:01,190
I want you to dig.

866
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:01,909
What is it?

867
00:41:01,909 --> 00:41:05,670
Upgrade kit?

868
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:05,989
OK.

869
00:41:05,989 --> 00:41:06,789
Dig here.

870
00:41:06,789 --> 00:41:10,179
Oh, you're asleep.

871
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:10,500
Never mind.

872
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:10,820
All right.

873
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:11,460
You're awake.

874
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:17,380
Dig right here.

875
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:17,780
Oh, look.

876
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,340
You like the tree.

877
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:18,900
That's cool.

878
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:23,769
How you doing?

879
00:41:23,769 --> 00:41:24,969
Just sitting by the tree.

880
00:41:24,969 --> 00:41:29,929
You want a snack?

881
00:41:29,929 --> 00:41:31,909
Kind of.

882
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:32,949
What do you like for food?

883
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:39,260
My throat is so fucked up.

884
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:39,820
I don't know why.

885
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:41,960
I wish I told...

886
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,000
I wish I could tell you.

887
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,469
You want that?

888
00:41:46,469 --> 00:41:47,030
Have some.

889
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:49,800
It's been smoking too much.

890
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,039
No.

891
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:50,679
I just...

892
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:51,400
I'm fucked.

893
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:55,829
Weather fluctuations?

894
00:41:55,829 --> 00:41:56,630
It really might be.

895
00:41:56,630 --> 00:42:01,079
It's starting to become like 90 degrees here

896
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:01,960
and a lot of dust.

897
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,309
I got a filter though.

898
00:42:04,309 --> 00:42:06,889
All right.

899
00:42:06,889 --> 00:42:09,210
I'm going to take one quick silent...

900
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:10,309
Dispairing for a second.

901
00:42:10,309 --> 00:42:11,269
I'm going to try to get rid of it.

902
00:42:11,269 --> 00:42:25,130
Did anybody hear that?

903
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:25,849
I hope not.

904
00:42:25,849 --> 00:42:28,500
Because that was fucking heinous.

905
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:30,900
Rotate the tree.

906
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,769
You got it.

907
00:42:31,769 --> 00:42:44,789
All right.

908
00:42:44,789 --> 00:42:45,750
Did you dig there yet?

909
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:46,070
Stop.

910
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:47,269
Don't eat your own shit.

911
00:42:47,269 --> 00:42:48,070
Don't eat shit.

912
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:48,309
Stop.

913
00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:48,550
Stop.

914
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:48,789
Stop.

915
00:42:48,789 --> 00:42:48,869
Stop.

916
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:49,030
Stop.

917
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:49,190
No.

918
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:49,590
No.

919
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,250
Oh, now you're going to be all fucking mutated.

920
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:59,480
All right.

921
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,719
Stop.

922
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:02,280
What is it?

923
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,320
Toilet paper?

924
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:11,849
I want you to dig.

925
00:43:11,849 --> 00:43:13,289
Why did you not dig over there?

926
00:43:13,289 --> 00:43:17,449
Go play with this.

927
00:43:17,449 --> 00:43:18,570
Go learn.

928
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:24,519
I need someone to dig over here.

929
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:30,820
Okay.

930
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:31,619
More seeds.

931
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:32,659
Very cool.

932
00:43:32,659 --> 00:43:33,300
Eat poop.

933
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,380
Unlocks pizza bagel.

934
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:40,570
Why would eating your own shit unlock a bagel?

935
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:40,809
All right.

936
00:43:40,809 --> 00:43:42,090
Everyone, people are getting hungry.

937
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:43,929
Should I just start putting out pizza bagels?

938
00:43:43,929 --> 00:43:46,460
All right.

939
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:49,960
Dig right there.

940
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,320
And Randy.

941
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:55,579
Dig right here.

942
00:43:55,579 --> 00:43:56,219
Very good.

943
00:43:56,219 --> 00:43:59,980
It's a seedbed curse.

944
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:05,619
All right.

945
00:44:05,619 --> 00:44:06,900
We're gonna start feeding pizza.

946
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:09,130
You've shitting so much.

947
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:17,300
Why you shit so much?

948
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,460
Hey.

949
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:20,980
Now you dig right here too.

950
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:21,860
Can you dig here?

951
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:24,599
Oh, what do you get?

952
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:25,000
Nice.

953
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,769
I don't know what just happened.

954
00:44:29,769 --> 00:44:31,539
Okay.

955
00:44:31,539 --> 00:44:35,460
Randy.

956
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,260
Right there.

957
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:40,650
I'm gonna plant some stuff here.

958
00:44:41,699 --> 00:44:42,420
Don't delete the dirt.

959
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:42,900
Why not?

960
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:48,019
How do I do pizza bagel?

961
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:53,670
Is pizza bagel not in there?

962
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:57,849
How can I not move the...

963
00:44:59,480 --> 00:44:59,800
What?

964
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:04,260
It's a different...

965
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,059
I did...

966
00:45:05,059 --> 00:45:06,340
It's a different dispenser.

967
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:11,429
Oh, I got another pen.

968
00:45:11,429 --> 00:45:14,710
How does that work?

969
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:19,019
You need to go to bed.

970
00:45:19,019 --> 00:45:22,500
Okay.

971
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,860
Let's plant some seeds here.

972
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:30,539
Let's do blue flowers and golden lupine.

973
00:45:31,639 --> 00:45:35,079
And daisies.

974
00:45:35,079 --> 00:45:40,489
What are they doing?

975
00:45:40,489 --> 00:45:42,090
Oh, they're eating food pellets.

976
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:42,650
Okay.

977
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:47,059
Stop fighting each other.

978
00:45:47,059 --> 00:45:48,900
Blue flowers, red thorns.

979
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,099
Tell a joke already.

980
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:51,480
What would you like...

981
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,760
What material would you like me to do?

982
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,920
How about you...

983
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,760
How about you fucking relax?

984
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:05,210
It's a dollhouse?

985
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:05,690
Good one.

986
00:46:09,429 --> 00:46:10,469
I just like felt that.

987
00:46:10,469 --> 00:46:11,829
I like inhaled whatever that was.

988
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:15,099
How do I unlock the cheeseburger?

989
00:46:15,099 --> 00:46:25,269
I don't like where this is.

990
00:46:25,269 --> 00:46:26,230
I don't like this.

991
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:27,670
It's kind of...

992
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:30,920
It's in the way.

993
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:31,559
Isn't it?

994
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:40,650
It's in the way.

995
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:44,199
All right.

996
00:46:44,199 --> 00:46:45,000
Everyone's doing okay.

997
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:45,239
What...

998
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:46,840
I have another pen.

999
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:50,840
Oh, you can...

1000
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:51,079
Okay.

1001
00:46:52,199 --> 00:46:56,070
So if they eat the nutritional pellet,

1002
00:46:56,070 --> 00:46:57,909
they'll be orange.

1003
00:46:57,909 --> 00:46:59,559
Interesting.

1004
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:00,820
Okay.

1005
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:03,769
You lose a tooth?

1006
00:47:03,769 --> 00:47:05,909
Baby tooth?

1007
00:47:05,909 --> 00:47:06,710
They can eat this?

1008
00:47:07,269 --> 00:47:08,389
Why would they eat this?

1009
00:47:08,389 --> 00:47:09,909
Should somebody eat it?

1010
00:47:09,909 --> 00:47:17,260
I wonder what happened.

1011
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:19,019
Maybe that'll like give them different properties.

1012
00:47:19,019 --> 00:47:19,900
Should you eat this?

1013
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,349
All right.

1014
00:47:21,349 --> 00:47:25,960
Eat that.

1015
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:26,360
You all right?

1016
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:26,760
Was that...

1017
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:31,130
Should I not have done that?

1018
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:32,809
Whoa.

1019
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:33,130
Okay.

1020
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:33,929
I don't know what that does.

1021
00:47:33,929 --> 00:47:34,250
But all right.

1022
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:39,460
We need to breed a squiry.

1023
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:41,619
Stop doing that.

1024
00:47:41,619 --> 00:47:44,099
What the fuck?

1025
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:47,349
Isn't this the...

1026
00:47:47,349 --> 00:47:47,590
Stop.

1027
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:48,789
Don't dig up the flowers.

1028
00:47:48,789 --> 00:47:50,070
Stop digging up the flowers.

1029
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:50,949
You're digging up the flowers.

1030
00:47:50,949 --> 00:47:51,750
You're being annoying.

1031
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:53,750
They're digging the flowers up.

1032
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:56,090
Get the cocoon.

1033
00:47:56,090 --> 00:48:15,019
Oh, you're ready.

1034
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:15,659
Okay.

1035
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:17,099
Got green ears now.

1036
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:21,059
It got a little fatter.

1037
00:48:21,059 --> 00:48:22,019
A little longer.

1038
00:48:22,019 --> 00:48:23,219
It's no shrunk.

1039
00:48:23,219 --> 00:48:25,989
Interesting.

1040
00:48:25,989 --> 00:48:26,150
Okay.

1041
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:26,789
What about you?

1042
00:48:26,789 --> 00:48:29,619
Who just did that?

1043
00:48:29,619 --> 00:48:37,460
They made like a Minecraft house?

1044
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:40,230
That's kind of cool.

1045
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:41,510
This game is...

1046
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:42,550
This game's cute.

1047
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:49,000
Mutation up.

1048
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:55,239
The flowers are kind of just overgrowing here.

1049
00:48:55,239 --> 00:49:01,880
Article board?

1050
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:11,780
Where is...

1051
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:12,099
Okay.

1052
00:49:12,099 --> 00:49:12,739
Hatch.

1053
00:49:12,739 --> 00:49:18,019
What have we got?

1054
00:49:18,019 --> 00:49:19,460
Oh, green.

1055
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:23,960
It's green with a little head.

1056
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:28,889
Okay.

1057
00:49:28,889 --> 00:49:31,909
Cool.

1058
00:49:31,909 --> 00:49:33,030
I wonder what like...

1059
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:34,710
How elaborate does this go?

1060
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:37,860
Can I get a lullaby?

1061
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:39,219
This is my first stream.

1062
00:49:39,219 --> 00:49:41,480
I was...

1063
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:45,739
No.

1064
00:49:45,739 --> 00:49:49,559
Look inside.

1065
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:52,650
Are you making this gold?

1066
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:57,019
How do I...

1067
00:49:57,019 --> 00:49:57,659
What do I...

1068
00:49:57,659 --> 00:49:58,679
Expel?

1069
00:49:58,679 --> 00:50:04,940
What did I just do?

1070
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:05,579
This gold.

1071
00:50:05,579 --> 00:50:07,980
They found gold and I just deleted it.

1072
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:16,039
They're making a mineshaft.

1073
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:29,139
Lullaby or riot?

1074
00:50:29,139 --> 00:50:29,780
No.

1075
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:31,079
You guys are weird.

1076
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:31,880
I'm not doing that.

1077
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,840
That's weird.

1078
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:36,380
I think we can do a...

1079
00:50:37,579 --> 00:50:38,860
We can do some breeding, right?

1080
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:42,380
Is that possible?

1081
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:43,079
No.

1082
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:43,639
Not yet.

1083
00:50:43,639 --> 00:50:49,579
You get it as new.

1084
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:50,219
Whatever that was.

1085
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:52,980
You get it from eating dirt?

1086
00:50:52,980 --> 00:51:01,880
We need a bedtime.

1087
00:51:11,829 --> 00:51:12,389
No.

1088
00:51:12,389 --> 00:51:12,789
I...

1089
00:51:12,789 --> 00:51:13,510
I'm not doing it.

1090
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:14,469
And this is not one of those like...

1091
00:51:14,469 --> 00:51:14,710
Chat!

1092
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:15,510
I'm not gonna do the thing!

1093
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:15,750
Chat!

1094
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:16,230
I'm not gonna...

1095
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:17,190
I'm not actually doing this.

1096
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:17,590
That's weird.

1097
00:51:19,449 --> 00:51:19,690
All right.

1098
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:20,250
Eat that.

1099
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:20,730
Who's hungry?

1100
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:21,690
Anybody still hungry?

1101
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:24,550
Everybody needs to go to bed.

1102
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:25,190
Right now.

1103
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:37,369
Go to bed right now.

1104
00:51:37,369 --> 00:51:41,000
Bounce?

1105
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,039
Like this little like...

1106
00:51:42,039 --> 00:51:43,320
Fucking giraffe.

1107
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,199
Whatever it is.

1108
00:51:44,199 --> 00:51:45,190
You just get like...

1109
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:47,110
They have like giraffe heads.

1110
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:50,010
Oh!

1111
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:50,889
You found dirt!

1112
00:51:50,889 --> 00:52:03,219
Good job.

1113
00:52:03,219 --> 00:52:04,820
Everybody go relax in bed.

1114
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:07,670
Go...

1115
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:12,730
Oh, we can upgrade the den.

1116
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:13,690
Oh, shit.

1117
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:16,469
This is a...

1118
00:52:16,469 --> 00:52:16,869
All right.

1119
00:52:16,869 --> 00:52:17,510
Somebody eat this.

1120
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:20,260
Who do I want to eat this?

1121
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:22,550
All right.

1122
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:23,510
Let's have Squary do it.

1123
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:24,550
Because Squary is already like...

1124
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:25,269
I don't know.

1125
00:52:25,269 --> 00:52:27,030
Squary seems to have the most mutations.

1126
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:29,539
Okay.

1127
00:52:29,539 --> 00:52:31,050
Eat that.

1128
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:33,530
Eat that like clump of gold dirt.

1129
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:41,300
This shit is gold.

1130
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:47,659
Please import a fucked up dog.

1131
00:52:48,219 --> 00:52:53,269
Play white noise?

1132
00:52:53,269 --> 00:52:54,309
Dude, no!

1133
00:52:54,309 --> 00:52:55,989
I'm not playing white noise.

1134
00:52:55,989 --> 00:52:57,929
It's just the lighting.

1135
00:52:57,929 --> 00:52:58,170
It's...

1136
00:52:58,170 --> 00:52:59,050
Oh, okay.

1137
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:03,139
Doggy bopper.

1138
00:53:03,139 --> 00:53:05,590
Destruct a den.

1139
00:53:06,309 --> 00:53:08,710
Oh, I got a jungle food dispenser.

1140
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:12,519
And a dog biscuit.

1141
00:53:12,519 --> 00:53:12,920
All right.

1142
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:13,320
Let's go.

1143
00:53:14,809 --> 00:53:16,889
I feel like this is gonna start to get really interesting here.

1144
00:53:16,889 --> 00:53:18,389
What do we got?

1145
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:23,530
Above or below?

1146
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:27,829
Probably right next to it.

1147
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:30,969
Right here?

1148
00:53:30,969 --> 00:53:31,530
Oh, shit.

1149
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:32,090
All right.

1150
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:32,730
Nice.

1151
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:33,500
Very nice.

1152
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:33,820
Very nice.

1153
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,960
Very nice.

1154
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:36,519
I want...

1155
00:53:37,239 --> 00:53:38,760
Okay.

1156
00:53:39,619 --> 00:53:42,340
Ancient relic food dispenser?

1157
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:44,809
That sounds cool.

1158
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:47,719
Ooh.

1159
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:51,960
Let's just get some of these out here.

1160
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:56,630
Banana.

1161
00:53:56,630 --> 00:53:57,110
Coconut.

1162
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:00,170
Cut fruit.

1163
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:02,969
Squary, eat that.

1164
00:54:02,969 --> 00:54:05,179
Squary, go eat the banana.

1165
00:54:05,179 --> 00:54:07,940
And then...

1166
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:10,500
What are they eating?

1167
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,460
Oh, they're like...

1168
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:14,179
They're sharing a delicious shit meal together.

1169
00:54:14,659 --> 00:54:23,099
What happens if you scold them?

1170
00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:23,880
I don't know.

1171
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:27,699
Flowers are coming in.

1172
00:54:27,699 --> 00:54:29,849
All right.

1173
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:30,969
Bandit, eat the coconut.

1174
00:54:30,969 --> 00:54:34,340
I wonder what you get from this.

1175
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:39,159
Ooh.

1176
00:54:39,159 --> 00:54:40,599
Good, good, good, good, good, good.

1177
00:54:40,599 --> 00:54:41,400
That's a new death.

1178
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,000
That's new genetics.

1179
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,230
Okay.

1180
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:46,630
I need...

1181
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:53,480
Randy, go eat the cut fruit.

1182
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:54,599
More mutations.

1183
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:55,159
Go eat this.

1184
00:54:55,719 --> 00:54:57,000
Eat the coconut, actually.

1185
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,050
Everybody doing all right?

1186
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:02,409
You're not having a good time.

1187
00:55:02,409 --> 00:55:03,289
Here, come here.

1188
00:55:03,289 --> 00:55:08,969
This is the Sims LSD DLC.

1189
00:55:08,969 --> 00:55:14,579
Can you make them have a pink nose?

1190
00:55:14,579 --> 00:55:15,219
Maybe.

1191
00:55:15,219 --> 00:55:17,179
All right.

1192
00:55:17,179 --> 00:55:17,739
You need to eat something.

1193
00:55:17,739 --> 00:55:18,139
Come on out.

1194
00:55:21,429 --> 00:55:21,989
Come on here.

1195
00:55:21,989 --> 00:55:22,389
Come on out.

1196
00:55:24,329 --> 00:55:28,570
You okay?

1197
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:29,289
Road carpet?

1198
00:55:29,849 --> 00:55:30,489
That's funny.

1199
00:55:30,489 --> 00:55:33,820
All right.

1200
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:36,760
We have new mutations.

1201
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:37,480
Don't know what they do.

1202
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:41,130
They're just from eating shit.

1203
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:41,610
All right.

1204
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:44,409
I think we're almost time to breed.

1205
00:55:44,409 --> 00:55:51,960
Can I put them up with bananas?

1206
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:55,159
How's everybody doing?

1207
00:55:57,269 --> 00:55:58,230
Randy, go to sleep now.

1208
00:55:59,929 --> 00:56:00,809
I can upgrade it again?

1209
00:56:04,099 --> 00:56:04,980
Randy, go to bed.

1210
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:06,699
How come Randy's just sitting here?

1211
00:56:06,699 --> 00:56:12,440
Go sleep in the house.

1212
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:12,920
Come on, Randy.

1213
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:13,400
Get up.

1214
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:22,900
Upgrade to the Spencer.

1215
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:23,460
Can I?

1216
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:27,349
I have to do it in the build...

1217
00:56:27,349 --> 00:56:28,630
My god, listen to me.

1218
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:34,260
This is like the worst I think it's ever been.

1219
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:34,840
It's been...

1220
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,809
It's horrible right now.

1221
00:56:36,809 --> 00:56:37,050
All right.

1222
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:37,449
He's sleeping.

1223
00:56:37,449 --> 00:56:44,599
That's good.

1224
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:45,000
Clip.

1225
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:45,480
Clip.

1226
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,480
The Lich King was announced today.

1227
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,079
Are you going to stream it when it launches?

1228
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:53,480
No.

1229
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,909
Streamer sings chat a lullaby.

1230
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:36,739
I was shit-faced, okay?

1231
00:57:36,739 --> 00:57:41,539
What do you want me to say?

1232
00:57:41,539 --> 00:57:42,340
No, it's yours.

1233
00:57:45,239 --> 00:57:49,699
That was a Fortnite clip.

1234
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:51,460
The end of this is what you wanted to watch.

1235
00:57:55,769 --> 00:57:59,610
I was shit-faced.

1236
00:58:30,179 --> 00:58:31,380
The POV.

1237
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:32,019
God damn.

1238
00:58:32,019 --> 00:58:34,440
That's so fucking stupid.

1239
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:37,269
Imagine if you looked like that.

1240
00:58:37,269 --> 00:58:37,590
That's...

1241
00:58:38,309 --> 00:58:40,710
All right.

1242
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:41,590
Who didn't eat the...

1243
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:42,630
Who didn't eat their...

1244
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:43,909
Who didn't eat their whole dinner?

1245
00:58:43,909 --> 00:58:47,500
Their banana.

1246
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:47,820
There.

1247
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:48,699
This is your lullaby.

1248
00:58:48,699 --> 00:58:49,179
This is kind of...

1249
00:58:49,179 --> 00:58:50,780
This is just growing out of control here, I think.

1250
00:58:54,789 --> 00:58:56,309
Give us a lullaby and wipe away the debt.

1251
00:58:56,309 --> 00:58:56,949
No.

1252
00:58:56,949 --> 00:58:59,019
All right.

1253
00:58:59,019 --> 00:58:59,900
Squarie, play with this.

1254
00:59:01,849 --> 00:59:02,409
Go grab that.

1255
00:59:02,969 --> 00:59:04,860
Look at how everyone's having such a great time.

1256
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:10,199
I still have two eggs that...

1257
00:59:10,199 --> 00:59:10,599
Okay.

1258
00:59:10,599 --> 00:59:11,000
I got to...

1259
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,179
I'm probably going to put whatever...

1260
00:59:13,179 --> 00:59:13,579
I...

1261
00:59:13,579 --> 00:59:16,860
Whoever gets breeded here is going over here.

1262
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:17,690
Because we're getting...

1263
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:18,969
This is getting kind of crowded.

1264
00:59:18,969 --> 00:59:20,889
He's really rude today?

1265
00:59:20,889 --> 00:59:21,050
What?

1266
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:21,769
What are you talking about?

1267
00:59:21,769 --> 00:59:22,010
What?

1268
00:59:25,699 --> 00:59:26,179
Rude?

1269
00:59:26,179 --> 00:59:27,539
How am I rude today?

1270
00:59:27,539 --> 00:59:27,940
What do you mean?

1271
00:59:32,889 --> 00:59:34,250
I got some other shit, didn't I?

1272
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:34,489
All right.

1273
00:59:34,489 --> 00:59:34,889
Let me...

1274
00:59:34,889 --> 00:59:36,170
Let me prepare this place.

1275
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:41,820
No, I don't like...

1276
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:42,300
That looks...

1277
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:43,500
That looks kind of scary.

1278
00:59:44,219 --> 00:59:44,460
All right.

1279
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:45,900
This one's going to be the ball pit

1280
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:49,829
with the starry background.

1281
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:54,039
There'll be a doggy bopper in the corner.

1282
00:59:58,889 --> 00:59:59,849
We'll do this one in here.

1283
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:03,849
And...

1284
01:00:03,849 --> 01:00:05,190
Okay.

1285
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:06,150
This one's pretty much ready.

1286
01:00:06,869 --> 01:00:15,980
So when...

1287
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:16,219
How...

1288
01:00:16,219 --> 01:00:17,420
When do you become adults?

1289
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,360
Use the tubes to connect them?

1290
01:00:22,409 --> 01:00:22,809
Really?

1291
01:00:23,449 --> 01:00:25,880
It's like starting room.

1292
01:00:29,909 --> 01:00:30,949
Oh, shit!

1293
01:00:30,949 --> 01:00:31,510
That's cool.

1294
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:31,829
All right.

1295
01:00:35,059 --> 01:00:35,460
They have...

1296
01:00:35,539 --> 01:00:37,059
Oh, they can go wherever they want now.

1297
01:00:37,699 --> 01:00:38,500
That's pretty cool.

1298
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:43,960
What the fuck?

1299
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:44,519
What just happened?

1300
01:00:44,519 --> 01:00:46,789
Are you all right?

1301
01:00:46,789 --> 01:00:47,590
Mud, what just happened?

1302
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:49,989
Who just threw him?

1303
01:00:49,989 --> 01:00:56,280
We gotta get...

1304
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:56,599
Hold on.

1305
01:00:56,599 --> 01:01:01,210
In here.

1306
01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:01,610
Oh!

1307
01:01:02,809 --> 01:01:03,130
What?

1308
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:03,929
Okay.

1309
01:01:05,179 --> 01:01:06,460
I didn't know you could do that.

1310
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:12,280
It has to be in this room, doesn't it?

1311
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,380
All right.

1312
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:15,420
We'll just delete it.

1313
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:16,699
But I'm going to put that in here.

1314
01:01:16,699 --> 01:01:22,730
Oh, I have to...

1315
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:22,889
Okay.

1316
01:01:22,889 --> 01:01:27,349
There's a big tree in the corner.

1317
01:01:27,349 --> 01:01:28,789
This...

1318
01:01:28,789 --> 01:01:29,829
Maybe this should be the playroom.

1319
01:01:29,829 --> 01:01:31,030
Should this be the playroom?

1320
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:37,739
I think this is going to be the fun playroom.

1321
01:01:37,739 --> 01:01:39,800
I'm going to have like an eating...

1322
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,320
A feeding room too, eventually.

1323
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:45,929
Yeah, this would be like the fun room.

1324
01:01:45,929 --> 01:01:53,210
They want to like play with like toys and stuff.

1325
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:53,849
They come in here.

1326
01:01:53,849 --> 01:01:59,139
Okay, because that's the balls on the ground.

1327
01:01:59,139 --> 01:01:59,460
Means...

1328
01:02:00,019 --> 01:02:00,260
Or...

1329
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:01,940
Yeah, that's better.

1330
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:05,139
I think the hot dog...

1331
01:02:05,139 --> 01:02:07,059
No, that's going to be the feeding room.

1332
01:02:07,059 --> 01:02:07,460
I like this.

1333
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:08,099
This looks good.

1334
01:02:10,679 --> 01:02:11,559
Okay, cool.

1335
01:02:11,559 --> 01:02:13,179
All right.

1336
01:02:13,179 --> 01:02:14,139
Dev and Chat.

1337
01:02:14,139 --> 01:02:17,380
What's going on, Dev?

1338
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:24,699
Big fan of your game.

1339
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:25,659
Are you high?

1340
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:30,099
They left.

1341
01:02:30,099 --> 01:02:31,539
Oh, side pupae.

1342
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:35,050
All right.

1343
01:02:35,050 --> 01:02:35,769
This is going to be interesting.

1344
01:02:35,769 --> 01:02:41,909
Squary has eaten a coconut, a banana, and somebody else's shit.

1345
01:02:41,909 --> 01:02:48,889
So I wonder what's going to happen.

1346
01:02:48,889 --> 01:02:49,929
Oh, you're ready to go too.

1347
01:02:52,179 --> 01:02:56,059
Ooh, ooh.

1348
01:02:56,059 --> 01:02:57,610
You ready to go?

1349
01:02:57,610 --> 01:02:58,570
All right, let's go.

1350
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:05,480
This is the moment here.

1351
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:10,199
You've never seen a high person.

1352
01:03:10,199 --> 01:03:11,559
I wish he was high.

1353
01:03:11,559 --> 01:03:21,929
Yeah, I love how acting a little strange means on drugs, right?

1354
01:03:21,929 --> 01:03:23,929
Like you're on drugs.

1355
01:03:23,929 --> 01:03:25,980
What do we got?

1356
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:37,030
This is Squary.

1357
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:39,429
The only thing that really changed is he got a lot bigger.

1358
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:44,260
Did you, though?

1359
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:48,489
You look still kind of small.

1360
01:03:48,489 --> 01:03:49,210
Oh, no.

1361
01:03:49,210 --> 01:03:51,739
What's wrong?

1362
01:03:51,739 --> 01:03:56,250
Are you okay?

1363
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:58,300
Is your legs too small?

1364
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:07,909
Big head.

1365
01:04:07,909 --> 01:04:09,510
All right.

1366
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:10,469
Color changing a little bit.

1367
01:04:11,670 --> 01:04:13,670
It got a little bit bigger.

1368
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:20,010
I think it's now we can actually do some breeding here.

1369
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:22,070
So what do I want to do?

1370
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:25,019
I definitely want...

1371
01:04:25,739 --> 01:04:27,420
Squary's got some interesting traits.

1372
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:27,659
All right.

1373
01:04:27,659 --> 01:04:28,380
Let's do...

1374
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:29,579
You can go to sleep first.

1375
01:04:29,579 --> 01:04:31,750
Squary and mud?

1376
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:41,559
What do you think?

1377
01:04:41,559 --> 01:04:42,760
Dead body reported.

1378
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:44,840
This is a foam ham, man.

1379
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:50,170
Are you injecting cannabis?

1380
01:04:50,170 --> 01:04:50,809
I deleted this.

1381
01:04:50,809 --> 01:04:51,530
Why is it still here?

1382
01:04:52,090 --> 01:04:55,690
Oh, my God.

1383
01:04:55,690 --> 01:04:56,409
There's fucking...

1384
01:04:56,409 --> 01:04:57,769
I just threw them around the room.

1385
01:04:57,769 --> 01:04:59,239
Why is it still here?

1386
01:04:59,239 --> 01:04:59,639
Delete this.

1387
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:02,699
Oh, wait.

1388
01:05:02,699 --> 01:05:09,369
You okay?

1389
01:05:09,369 --> 01:05:13,849
Speak.

1390
01:05:13,849 --> 01:05:14,409
Very good.

1391
01:05:14,409 --> 01:05:14,969
Very good.

1392
01:05:14,969 --> 01:05:15,369
Very good.

1393
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:15,610
All right.

1394
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:16,329
Hang out in the playroom.

1395
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:16,969
That's fine.

1396
01:05:16,969 --> 01:05:22,809
Where is everybody?

1397
01:05:22,809 --> 01:05:23,130
All right.

1398
01:05:23,130 --> 01:05:24,329
It's time.

1399
01:05:24,329 --> 01:05:24,969
It's time.

1400
01:05:24,969 --> 01:05:28,570
Dude, what do you mean not old enough?

1401
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:29,289
Not old enough?

1402
01:05:29,289 --> 01:05:30,010
How?

1403
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:36,789
Are you hungry?

1404
01:05:36,789 --> 01:05:38,550
Just sitting at the food dispenser.

1405
01:05:41,019 --> 01:05:41,820
This is like auto.

1406
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:46,119
I have a little...

1407
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:48,300
What's wrong with you?

1408
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:54,219
I have a little cabinet that I keep dog food and dog treats in.

1409
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:56,579
And I'll get up.

1410
01:05:56,579 --> 01:05:57,860
They'll be like on the couch or something.

1411
01:05:57,860 --> 01:06:02,730
And I'll just get up and kind of walk through the kitchen area.

1412
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:04,730
And he's just sitting there.

1413
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:06,010
He's going like this.

1414
01:06:07,699 --> 01:06:09,860
Sitting and looking at me right in front of the cabinet.

1415
01:06:11,429 --> 01:06:11,909
Just like...

1416
01:06:13,079 --> 01:06:15,079
I don't know how long he's been sitting there.

1417
01:06:15,079 --> 01:06:20,380
But he's just like, I'm here.

1418
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:21,420
And it's getting old.

1419
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:23,019
They're not ready to pass on just yet.

1420
01:06:23,019 --> 01:06:25,579
But they don't have much time left.

1421
01:06:25,579 --> 01:06:28,150
What?

1422
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:28,630
Oh, no.

1423
01:06:30,739 --> 01:06:31,940
Randy's getting older.

1424
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:32,980
Oh, shit.

1425
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:37,670
I need to...

1426
01:06:37,670 --> 01:06:38,309
We got to breed, right?

1427
01:06:38,309 --> 01:06:39,349
We got to breed now.

1428
01:06:39,349 --> 01:06:40,940
I got to breed right now.

1429
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:45,590
We got to breed.

1430
01:06:45,590 --> 01:07:02,280
I have to do it.

1431
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:02,840
We're going to like...

1432
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:04,679
Our population is going to decrease.

1433
01:07:04,679 --> 01:07:07,110
I like...

1434
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:07,750
Okay, I want...

1435
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:09,429
I like the eyes.

1436
01:07:09,909 --> 01:07:11,039
Who's...

1437
01:07:16,010 --> 01:07:17,050
Very vocal.

1438
01:07:17,050 --> 01:07:27,269
Okay.

1439
01:07:27,829 --> 01:07:32,869
I think this is good.

1440
01:07:33,429 --> 01:07:34,969
Should I keep going?

1441
01:07:36,699 --> 01:07:37,340
It's the giant...

1442
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:37,900
It's the rat.

1443
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:38,619
Yeah.

1444
01:07:38,619 --> 01:07:39,989
All right.

1445
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:40,869
Let's get you in here.

1446
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:45,050
And let's get...

1447
01:07:46,969 --> 01:07:47,449
You in here.

1448
01:07:48,090 --> 01:07:48,650
You're funny.

1449
01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:49,610
You're doing like a funny thing.

1450
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:58,280
Again?

1451
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:02,170
I think that's good.

1452
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:04,730
I don't think there's enough different genetic mutations here that can happen.

1453
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:09,980
Generate it 50 times.

1454
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:10,219
What?

1455
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:13,210
Is that going to be bad?

1456
01:08:13,929 --> 01:08:14,809
Won't that be bad?

1457
01:08:19,579 --> 01:08:20,140
Keep going.

1458
01:08:20,859 --> 01:08:25,779
Is it a cow?

1459
01:08:25,779 --> 01:08:26,899
What the fuck was that?

1460
01:08:27,699 --> 01:08:30,229
All right.

1461
01:08:30,229 --> 01:08:31,430
Well, we're going to take the cow.

1462
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:32,840
And...

1463
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:35,640
Somebody else?

1464
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:35,880
You?

1465
01:08:41,979 --> 01:08:42,539
All right.

1466
01:08:42,539 --> 01:08:43,100
They're pink.

1467
01:08:43,979 --> 01:08:44,300
Again.

1468
01:08:44,859 --> 01:08:54,939
All right.

1469
01:08:54,939 --> 01:08:56,060
I don't want to do another one.

1470
01:08:56,060 --> 01:09:02,300
All right.

1471
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:02,859
That's it.

1472
01:09:02,859 --> 01:09:03,340
That's it.

1473
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:03,739
No more.

1474
01:09:05,579 --> 01:09:07,909
All right.

1475
01:09:07,909 --> 01:09:09,510
We're at 83% stability.

1476
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:09,909
I don't want...

1477
01:09:09,909 --> 01:09:10,470
That's too much.

1478
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:13,640
Who just made the weird sound?

1479
01:09:15,659 --> 01:09:16,220
Keep going.

1480
01:09:18,329 --> 01:09:18,890
What?

1481
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:21,210
What's going to happen?

1482
01:09:21,210 --> 01:09:22,329
I don't know what's going to happen.

1483
01:09:22,329 --> 01:09:23,689
83% stable?

1484
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:29,140
This one's huge.

1485
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:32,869
I think...

1486
01:09:32,869 --> 01:09:33,189
All right.

1487
01:09:33,189 --> 01:09:33,829
This one.

1488
01:09:33,829 --> 01:09:34,149
I don't...

1489
01:09:34,149 --> 01:09:35,590
But that one might cause a problem in...

1490
01:09:36,550 --> 01:09:36,869
More?

1491
01:09:38,539 --> 01:09:38,779
No.

1492
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:40,039
No.

1493
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:41,640
Is it going to cause a problem?

1494
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:42,920
He's really kind of rambunctious.

1495
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:45,050
Let's go.

1496
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:55,899
All right.

1497
01:09:55,899 --> 01:09:56,699
Now we're going to watch this.

1498
01:09:57,619 --> 01:09:59,060
The dev tweeted at you.

1499
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:01,100
Really?

1500
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:01,579
Shut up.

1501
01:10:01,579 --> 01:10:02,460
That didn't happen.

1502
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:07,260
Shut up.

1503
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:08,460
Nobody tweeted at me.

1504
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:15,260
I don't see it.

1505
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:22,100
It's not...

1506
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:26,680
I didn't see it.

1507
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:26,920
All right.

1508
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:27,720
We know how this works.

1509
01:10:28,359 --> 01:10:37,510
That's cool though.

1510
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,760
The president is on the phone.

1511
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:43,560
You should pick it up.

1512
01:10:48,970 --> 01:10:50,550
Ah.

1513
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:50,949
I just...

1514
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:52,489
I don't know why.

1515
01:10:53,050 --> 01:10:54,010
I just see like...

1516
01:10:55,109 --> 01:10:56,710
Oh, what's going on in the White House today?

1517
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:59,109
And there's like a picture of like Joe Biden

1518
01:10:59,109 --> 01:11:01,029
sitting in a chair like this.

1519
01:11:02,229 --> 01:11:04,390
With his like sunglasses like down here

1520
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:05,909
and he's just sleeping.

1521
01:11:05,909 --> 01:11:08,069
And my Wobble Dog stream is like...

1522
01:11:09,130 --> 01:11:09,689
On like the...

1523
01:11:09,689 --> 01:11:12,090
Like a big TV in like the Oval Office.

1524
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:17,180
Like, oh, your stream is like so boring.

1525
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:23,739
But why would he be watching?

1526
01:11:25,899 --> 01:11:26,699
Oh, water.

1527
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:35,460
Why wouldn't he be?

1528
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:36,020
I don't know.

1529
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:42,520
Imagine how...

1530
01:11:43,479 --> 01:11:46,039
Imagine any like that big public figure

1531
01:11:46,039 --> 01:11:46,680
just doing the...

1532
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:48,579
This thing.

1533
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:51,510
Nobody looks good when they're sleeping

1534
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:52,470
not in bed, by the way.

1535
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:55,029
Everybody looks fucking crazy.

1536
01:11:56,359 --> 01:11:57,000
Why is that?

1537
01:11:58,649 --> 01:12:00,170
There has been like pictures I know

1538
01:12:00,170 --> 01:12:00,810
that have been like...

1539
01:12:01,689 --> 01:12:03,289
Everybody has that photo, right?

1540
01:12:03,289 --> 01:12:04,890
Like, oh, mom took it or something.

1541
01:12:05,449 --> 01:12:07,770
Where you're like in like the car

1542
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:09,130
or you're on the couch or something

1543
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:09,529
and you're like...

1544
01:12:10,090 --> 01:12:14,470
Like, what the...

1545
01:12:14,470 --> 01:12:15,029
Why do we do...

1546
01:12:15,029 --> 01:12:16,229
What's going on here?

1547
01:12:16,229 --> 01:12:17,109
Why do we go like...

1548
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:21,460
Like, it hurts to do that.

1549
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:22,579
It's actually hard to do that.

1550
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:26,380
How come we don't go like...

1551
01:12:27,770 --> 01:12:28,569
It's always like...

1552
01:12:29,130 --> 01:12:34,649
All right, incubate that egg.

1553
01:12:34,649 --> 01:12:38,149
I can't wait to see what happens here.

1554
01:12:38,149 --> 01:12:42,119
We're unknowingly supporting our heads.

1555
01:12:42,119 --> 01:12:43,260
That's weird.

1556
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:48,409
The body was never meant to fall asleep

1557
01:12:48,409 --> 01:12:49,289
sitting upright.

1558
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:02,069
You literally showed a picture of you

1559
01:13:02,069 --> 01:13:02,949
once when he's sleeping

1560
01:13:02,949 --> 01:13:03,909
and he looked like beef?

1561
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:05,829
Beef and cheese?

1562
01:13:05,829 --> 01:13:07,350
What the fuck are you talking about?

1563
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:09,720
Oh!

1564
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:10,600
All right, we need a name.

1565
01:13:17,939 --> 01:13:20,600
Spam.

1566
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:21,180
Ew.

1567
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:25,060
All right, welcome to the world, Spam.

1568
01:13:25,619 --> 01:13:29,539
How are you?

1569
01:13:29,539 --> 01:13:30,500
You're going to get a steady diet

1570
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:37,060
of coconuts and bananas.

1571
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:38,420
You must be very hungry.

1572
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:39,560
Go relax.

1573
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:45,500
How's everybody doing?

1574
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:46,699
All right, Mud, you need to...

1575
01:13:46,699 --> 01:13:47,100
Is this...

1576
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:49,380
Aren't they close to...

1577
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:50,579
I need to breed again,

1578
01:13:50,579 --> 01:13:51,619
but I don't need to.

1579
01:13:51,619 --> 01:13:52,119
Not yet.

1580
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:53,659
Well, that...

1581
01:13:53,659 --> 01:13:55,020
You're going to die much faster

1582
01:13:55,020 --> 01:14:01,300
if you keep doing that.

1583
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:01,859
All right, Mud.

1584
01:14:04,699 --> 01:14:10,579
Should I breed again?

1585
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:14,979
I don't think I want to.

1586
01:14:14,979 --> 01:14:16,420
You can recycle plastic bottles

1587
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:17,539
by giving them to a dog?

1588
01:14:19,270 --> 01:14:20,390
What if you eat this...

1589
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:21,189
Well, I don't...

1590
01:14:21,270 --> 01:14:21,989
I don't know, but you should probably

1591
01:14:21,989 --> 01:14:23,270
shouldn't eat plastic.

1592
01:14:23,270 --> 01:14:25,689
What happens if I eat...

1593
01:14:25,689 --> 01:14:26,729
Grab it.

1594
01:14:26,729 --> 01:14:28,859
Throw it.

1595
01:14:28,859 --> 01:14:29,979
That was a good try.

1596
01:14:29,979 --> 01:14:31,020
That was a good try.

1597
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:31,500
Try it again.

1598
01:14:32,649 --> 01:14:33,149
Throw it.

1599
01:14:33,609 --> 01:14:37,130
Come on, you can do it.

1600
01:14:37,130 --> 01:14:37,850
Come on.

1601
01:14:37,850 --> 01:14:40,300
Get over there and do it.

1602
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:41,020
Throw it.

1603
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:46,970
Come on.

1604
01:14:46,970 --> 01:14:51,319
You can do it.

1605
01:14:51,319 --> 01:14:51,819
Oh!

1606
01:14:52,359 --> 01:14:55,939
That was so good.

1607
01:14:55,939 --> 01:14:56,899
You threw that.

1608
01:14:56,899 --> 01:15:00,149
That was so good.

1609
01:15:00,149 --> 01:15:02,069
Okay, now destroy that.

1610
01:15:02,069 --> 01:15:06,859
Oh.

1611
01:15:06,859 --> 01:15:08,460
Your dogs can't walk.

1612
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:09,579
There's a baby.

1613
01:15:09,579 --> 01:15:11,670
It just came out.

1614
01:15:13,189 --> 01:15:16,470
What do you mean?

1615
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:17,989
This is the weirdest one.

1616
01:15:17,989 --> 01:15:19,670
I can't wait to breed this one.

1617
01:15:19,670 --> 01:15:24,250
He's a baby.

1618
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:24,890
Yeah, the baby...

1619
01:15:27,739 --> 01:15:28,140
Oh, sorry.

1620
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:29,100
The baby doesn't know how to walk.

1621
01:15:29,659 --> 01:15:34,199
What are you doing?

1622
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:39,720
I want to feed a very good diet of bananas

1623
01:15:41,159 --> 01:15:42,680
and coconuts.

1624
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:47,050
I don't want you eating chicken nuggets

1625
01:15:47,050 --> 01:15:47,369
or anything.

1626
01:15:47,369 --> 01:15:49,529
I want you eating good, nutritious fruits.

1627
01:15:50,090 --> 01:15:53,640
And it has lived a long, full life

1628
01:15:53,640 --> 01:16:02,489
and it's now time for them to pass on.

1629
01:16:02,489 --> 01:16:03,689
Oh no, Randy.

1630
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:10,880
Oh!

1631
01:16:12,729 --> 01:16:13,689
Oh my God.

1632
01:16:13,689 --> 01:16:14,189
What?

1633
01:16:18,170 --> 01:16:19,609
No, don't eat him.

1634
01:16:19,609 --> 01:16:21,609
He's going to go eat his body.

1635
01:16:21,689 --> 01:16:23,289
No, he's the weird one.

1636
01:16:23,289 --> 01:16:24,170
He's the weird one.

1637
01:16:24,890 --> 01:16:26,409
Don't...

1638
01:16:26,409 --> 01:16:27,529
You're not going to eat that, right?

1639
01:16:27,529 --> 01:16:27,930
How do I...

1640
01:16:27,930 --> 01:16:28,250
What do I...

1641
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:28,890
Dog head?

1642
01:16:29,939 --> 01:16:30,439
Oh!

1643
01:16:30,979 --> 01:16:34,069
Should I...

1644
01:16:34,069 --> 01:16:34,869
I don't know what I should do.

1645
01:16:34,869 --> 01:16:35,270
Should I...

1646
01:16:35,270 --> 01:16:36,470
Is this extra DNA points?

1647
01:16:39,989 --> 01:16:41,590
Oh my God.

1648
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:43,189
Do I get DNA or something?

1649
01:16:43,189 --> 01:16:43,750
Is this worth...

1650
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:44,149
I don't know.

1651
01:16:44,149 --> 01:16:44,949
Is it worth doing this?

1652
01:16:49,350 --> 01:16:51,109
I might get like DNA points.

1653
01:16:51,109 --> 01:16:51,670
I don't know.

1654
01:16:52,649 --> 01:16:53,529
All right.

1655
01:16:53,529 --> 01:16:54,489
I'm just testing this.

1656
01:16:54,489 --> 01:16:55,050
I don't like this

1657
01:16:55,050 --> 01:16:57,210
but this might actually unlock something.

1658
01:16:57,210 --> 01:17:10,489
It does.

1659
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:19,029
Okay, don't eat every...

1660
01:17:19,029 --> 01:17:20,310
Okay, this is fucked up.

1661
01:17:22,739 --> 01:17:24,579
High quality dog core?

1662
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:26,170
What is that?

1663
01:17:26,890 --> 01:17:28,329
High quality dog core.

1664
01:17:28,890 --> 01:17:30,520
Mysterious orb.

1665
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:33,850
Should I open it?

1666
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:39,720
Cracked open.

1667
01:17:40,279 --> 01:17:42,500
What is that?

1668
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:45,460
Somebody should eat this?

1669
01:17:55,060 --> 01:17:55,380
All right.

1670
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:56,260
You don't look at this.

1671
01:17:56,260 --> 01:17:57,539
I don't want you to see this.

1672
01:17:57,539 --> 01:18:03,159
You just stay over here and eat the coconuts.

1673
01:18:03,159 --> 01:18:05,850
Lifespan extended.

1674
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:06,970
Oh, look at that.

1675
01:18:06,970 --> 01:18:07,470
Okay.

1676
01:18:07,770 --> 01:18:09,479
All right.

1677
01:18:09,479 --> 01:18:10,119
You need to go to bed.

1678
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:15,060
All right.

1679
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:15,779
You guys go to sleep.

1680
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:19,449
Eat this coconut.

1681
01:18:20,010 --> 01:18:20,810
It's nutritious.

1682
01:18:20,810 --> 01:18:22,810
Don't eat other dogs, please.

1683
01:18:25,779 --> 01:18:26,420
Are you ready?

1684
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:26,979
Okay.

1685
01:18:26,979 --> 01:18:27,939
Pupate.

1686
01:18:27,939 --> 01:18:30,659
You're both ready to pupate.

1687
01:18:30,659 --> 01:18:38,520
You want to eat that first?

1688
01:18:42,010 --> 01:18:50,539
Eat that first because I want you to get more mutations.

1689
01:18:50,539 --> 01:18:51,260
I mean, one of you did.

1690
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:52,060
That was fucking cool.

1691
01:18:56,729 --> 01:18:56,970
All right.

1692
01:18:56,970 --> 01:18:57,770
You know, go for it.

1693
01:18:57,770 --> 01:18:58,270
Pupate.

1694
01:19:00,579 --> 01:19:01,079
Where's...

1695
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:13,319
We'll figure that out later.

1696
01:19:13,319 --> 01:19:22,760
All right.

1697
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:23,640
What do we got?

1698
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:25,140
You just ate something weird.

1699
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:25,939
Now you're...

1700
01:19:25,939 --> 01:19:28,739
Okay.

1701
01:19:28,739 --> 01:19:34,340
Adult, back legs, front legs.

1702
01:19:34,899 --> 01:19:37,529
He's pretty big now.

1703
01:19:37,529 --> 01:19:38,890
Front, bottom, leg length.

1704
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:43,460
I feel like the proportions are kind of wrong.

1705
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:53,670
Interesting.

1706
01:19:53,670 --> 01:19:54,789
What happened to you?

1707
01:19:54,789 --> 01:19:56,010
Nothing really.

1708
01:19:59,109 --> 01:19:59,590
Okay.

1709
01:19:59,590 --> 01:20:00,949
You got a little wider.

1710
01:20:00,949 --> 01:20:05,420
Okay.

1711
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:06,220
Very interesting.

1712
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:07,020
Very interesting.

1713
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:11,670
You can't walk now?

1714
01:20:11,670 --> 01:20:12,630
Yeah, you'll be fine.

1715
01:20:12,630 --> 01:20:17,210
It's fine.

1716
01:20:22,039 --> 01:20:22,760
There we go.

1717
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:23,319
Oh, God.

1718
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:24,199
You actually can't walk.

1719
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:28,869
You need to go to bed.

1720
01:20:28,869 --> 01:20:37,369
Okay.

1721
01:20:37,369 --> 01:20:38,010
You're fine.

1722
01:20:38,010 --> 01:20:41,399
You can walk.

1723
01:20:41,399 --> 01:20:44,789
They do need to go to sleep, though.

1724
01:20:44,789 --> 01:20:44,869
All right.

1725
01:20:44,869 --> 01:20:45,670
Let's clean up a little bit.

1726
01:20:45,670 --> 01:20:47,029
This is kind of a mess.

1727
01:20:47,029 --> 01:20:56,100
A mess.

1728
01:20:56,100 --> 01:21:02,420
Okay.

1729
01:21:02,420 --> 01:21:03,619
I got a lot of things to unlock.

1730
01:21:03,619 --> 01:21:05,739
Clean up 10 poops.

1731
01:21:05,739 --> 01:21:06,779
A ham slider.

1732
01:21:06,779 --> 01:21:08,300
Cool.

1733
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:09,930
Witness of death.

1734
01:21:09,930 --> 01:21:12,760
Dog Vision Jr.

1735
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:13,960
Open up a dog core.

1736
01:21:14,439 --> 01:21:15,560
Rock Speaker.

1737
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:17,960
Play for an hour.

1738
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:20,739
Space Lab Food.

1739
01:21:20,739 --> 01:21:21,699
Oh, hell yeah.

1740
01:21:21,699 --> 01:21:22,020
All right.

1741
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:22,260
All right.

1742
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:22,579
We got to...

1743
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:24,020
Let's do this right.

1744
01:21:28,359 --> 01:21:28,760
What do you think?

1745
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:29,319
Up top?

1746
01:21:29,319 --> 01:21:35,800
And then connect this.

1747
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:36,520
Oh, shit.

1748
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:37,159
I can't do that.

1749
01:21:43,619 --> 01:21:44,500
This is where they're going to...

1750
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:45,939
The feeding will be here.

1751
01:21:45,939 --> 01:21:48,170
I don't think they can connect like that.

1752
01:21:48,170 --> 01:21:48,970
Oh, they can?

1753
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:54,890
Can I do that?

1754
01:21:54,890 --> 01:21:55,770
Starting room?

1755
01:21:55,770 --> 01:21:56,489
Oh, starting wall.

1756
01:21:56,489 --> 01:21:57,050
Okay.

1757
01:21:57,050 --> 01:22:09,939
Starting room.

1758
01:22:09,939 --> 01:22:10,739
How do I move?

1759
01:22:10,739 --> 01:22:19,770
There we go.

1760
01:22:19,770 --> 01:22:20,329
What the...

1761
01:22:20,329 --> 01:22:22,890
Okay.

1762
01:22:22,890 --> 01:22:24,810
That works, right?

1763
01:22:24,810 --> 01:22:31,739
How do they get up there?

1764
01:22:31,739 --> 01:22:33,579
Can they get up there?

1765
01:22:33,579 --> 01:22:38,090
I'm not sure they can go that way.

1766
01:22:38,090 --> 01:22:52,039
Oh, there we go.

1767
01:22:52,039 --> 01:22:52,359
All right.

1768
01:22:52,359 --> 01:22:53,479
Now, how do I...

1769
01:22:53,479 --> 01:22:54,760
This is fucked up.

1770
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:56,279
How do I remove this one?

1771
01:22:56,279 --> 01:22:59,579
Oh, God.

1772
01:22:59,579 --> 01:23:01,420
I'm just starting to look at McDonald's play place.

1773
01:23:04,199 --> 01:23:06,539
Okay.

1774
01:23:06,539 --> 01:23:06,939
There we go.

1775
01:23:06,939 --> 01:23:10,460
So, this is going to be the feeding room.

1776
01:23:10,460 --> 01:23:16,920
What should I do?

1777
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:17,239
Food.

1778
01:23:17,239 --> 01:23:18,920
Let's do like a food room.

1779
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:20,279
Actually, this kind of reminds me like Chuck E Cheese.

1780
01:23:20,279 --> 01:23:20,920
Let's do that.

1781
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:22,920
To check the Twitter.

1782
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:23,159
All right.

1783
01:23:23,159 --> 01:23:23,640
I'm checking Twitter.

1784
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:23,800
Hold on.

1785
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:24,439
Wait, wait, wait.

1786
01:23:24,439 --> 01:23:27,579
What am I looking for?

1787
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:36,500
Okay.

1788
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:43,720
We need a nap.

1789
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:45,319
Please sing your fans a lullaby.

1790
01:23:45,319 --> 01:23:51,029
They won't stop asking me about it.

1791
01:23:51,029 --> 01:23:52,390
Please breed your dogs.

1792
01:23:55,189 --> 01:23:56,390
Aren't I doing that?

1793
01:23:56,390 --> 01:23:57,930
I'm breeding.

1794
01:23:57,930 --> 01:24:00,579
Or please breed your dogs.

1795
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:01,939
Didn't I do that?

1796
01:24:01,939 --> 01:24:06,010
Yeah, this actually is the dev, isn't it?

1797
01:24:06,010 --> 01:24:06,409
Okay.

1798
01:24:06,409 --> 01:24:07,750
Well, that's cool.

1799
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:08,229
I didn't...

1800
01:24:08,229 --> 01:24:09,270
I did it, didn't I?

1801
01:24:09,270 --> 01:24:12,600
Sing, chat, a lullaby.

1802
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:28,619
When you get old enough, over 21.

1803
01:24:28,619 --> 01:24:36,949
You woke up the baby.

1804
01:24:36,949 --> 01:24:38,619
All right.

1805
01:24:38,619 --> 01:24:39,420
Food.

1806
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:43,060
That was Trump.

1807
01:24:43,060 --> 01:24:49,880
That was Trump.

1808
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:55,180
All right.

1809
01:24:55,180 --> 01:25:02,329
This is the food room.

1810
01:25:02,329 --> 01:25:05,770
All dogs will come up here to the cafeteria station.

1811
01:25:05,770 --> 01:25:10,550
This is where they will be enjoying their meals.

1812
01:25:10,550 --> 01:25:14,340
This is going to be huge.

1813
01:25:14,340 --> 01:25:20,970
This is an ugly room.

1814
01:25:20,970 --> 01:25:21,449
All right.

1815
01:25:21,449 --> 01:25:21,689
Food.

1816
01:25:21,689 --> 01:25:26,579
There should be something to eat on.

1817
01:25:26,579 --> 01:25:27,140
Oh, no.

1818
01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:28,340
I actually don't think so.

1819
01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:29,699
Okay.

1820
01:25:29,699 --> 01:25:30,739
So now let's go play.

1821
01:25:31,930 --> 01:25:36,699
We got alien fruit.

1822
01:25:36,699 --> 01:25:37,739
Dehydrated treats.

1823
01:25:42,229 --> 01:25:43,189
Moon cheese.

1824
01:25:43,189 --> 01:25:44,899
Sure.

1825
01:25:44,899 --> 01:25:45,380
Onion.

1826
01:25:45,380 --> 01:25:48,680
Oh, okay.

1827
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:50,199
If they're hungry, they come up here.

1828
01:25:50,199 --> 01:25:51,079
They just got a lot of food.

1829
01:25:51,079 --> 01:25:52,279
They can just eat on the ground.

1830
01:25:52,279 --> 01:25:54,100
It's going to mutate the fuck out of them, though.

1831
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:54,899
But who cares?

1832
01:25:54,899 --> 01:25:59,220
Whoever's hungry.

1833
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:02,260
Okay.

1834
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:04,100
I need to hatch you now.

1835
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:11,100
Let's go.

1836
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:13,500
Very cool.

1837
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:15,420
Front leg stance width.

1838
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:17,159
Body girth.

1839
01:26:17,159 --> 01:26:17,720
All right.

1840
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:19,399
We need to get...

1841
01:26:19,399 --> 01:26:20,600
I got to get that egg in here.

1842
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:22,619
Okay.

1843
01:26:22,619 --> 01:26:23,500
We got to do another one.

1844
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:23,819
Yeah.

1845
01:26:23,819 --> 01:26:24,140
Let's go.

1846
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:27,930
Hurry up.

1847
01:26:27,930 --> 01:26:31,100
Mud and, uh, squary.

1848
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:32,550
Let's go.

1849
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:39,739
What do I do?

1850
01:26:39,739 --> 01:26:42,500
What happened to the fourth one?

1851
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:44,100
Oh, it's dead in the other room.

1852
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:45,369
Definitely this one.

1853
01:26:45,369 --> 01:26:45,449
All right.

1854
01:26:45,449 --> 01:26:47,130
We got a raid from G4.

1855
01:26:47,130 --> 01:26:48,170
G4 TV.

1856
01:26:48,170 --> 01:26:50,010
You guys just fucking dump raids on me.

1857
01:26:50,010 --> 01:26:50,489
Thanks, guys.

1858
01:26:51,130 --> 01:26:53,060
I hope you're having a good stream.

1859
01:26:53,699 --> 01:26:56,489
This is like the...

1860
01:26:56,489 --> 01:26:58,250
This is the fourth time the G4 has been here.

1861
01:26:58,810 --> 01:27:00,550
What's up, G4?

1862
01:27:02,020 --> 01:27:02,579
I appreciate it.

1863
01:27:02,579 --> 01:27:03,060
Thanks a lot.

1864
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:05,579
All right.

1865
01:27:05,579 --> 01:27:07,420
I'll take this one to zero.

1866
01:27:07,420 --> 01:27:14,310
Let's do two, like, kind of little ones.

1867
01:27:14,310 --> 01:27:18,970
G4 would like an encore.

1868
01:27:19,529 --> 01:27:20,329
All right.

1869
01:27:20,329 --> 01:27:21,529
This one's kind of weird.

1870
01:27:21,529 --> 01:27:22,810
How long should I do this for, though?

1871
01:27:28,470 --> 01:27:29,350
These two.

1872
01:27:29,350 --> 01:27:31,350
They're really, like, thin, skinny ones.

1873
01:27:31,350 --> 01:27:33,260
Do it until zero?

1874
01:27:33,819 --> 01:27:36,619
This one's really, like, glossy.

1875
01:27:36,619 --> 01:27:36,859
Yeah.

1876
01:27:36,859 --> 01:27:39,109
That one.

1877
01:27:39,109 --> 01:27:41,189
These two, like, pieces of fucking ham.

1878
01:27:44,810 --> 01:27:45,130
Whoa.

1879
01:27:47,770 --> 01:27:48,010
All right.

1880
01:27:48,010 --> 01:27:48,409
We got...

1881
01:27:50,579 --> 01:27:51,140
Interesting.

1882
01:27:54,979 --> 01:27:55,220
Again.

1883
01:27:55,859 --> 01:28:02,760
Again.

1884
01:28:03,699 --> 01:28:05,619
This really long one.

1885
01:28:05,619 --> 01:28:09,529
What happened?

1886
01:28:09,529 --> 01:28:09,930
Oh!

1887
01:28:10,569 --> 01:28:11,529
This one's...

1888
01:28:11,529 --> 01:28:11,770
Okay.

1889
01:28:11,770 --> 01:28:11,930
No.

1890
01:28:11,930 --> 01:28:12,329
We're good.

1891
01:28:15,579 --> 01:28:16,460
I don't know which one...

1892
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:17,739
Should I take one?

1893
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:21,739
I think I want to take this one.

1894
01:28:24,630 --> 01:28:25,109
One more?

1895
01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:27,819
Take the long one?

1896
01:28:28,460 --> 01:28:31,960
All right.

1897
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:32,520
One more time.

1898
01:28:33,079 --> 01:28:38,680
Okay.

1899
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:39,079
This one.

1900
01:28:39,079 --> 01:28:39,640
Look at this one.

1901
01:28:41,579 --> 01:28:42,380
That's so weird.

1902
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:42,619
All right.

1903
01:28:42,619 --> 01:28:43,739
How about one more?

1904
01:28:43,739 --> 01:28:44,140
One more.

1905
01:28:44,779 --> 01:28:59,880
They're becoming, like, slices of bacon.

1906
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:01,479
These two.

1907
01:29:01,479 --> 01:29:02,279
Like, yes.

1908
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:06,800
Uh...

1909
01:29:07,819 --> 01:29:08,539
It looks...

1910
01:29:08,539 --> 01:29:15,060
Do it...

1911
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:15,619
Keep going?

1912
01:29:18,970 --> 01:29:19,369
No, no.

1913
01:29:19,369 --> 01:29:19,609
All right.

1914
01:29:19,609 --> 01:29:22,170
The stability is going lower here.

1915
01:29:22,170 --> 01:29:23,529
I think it's going to be this one.

1916
01:29:25,050 --> 01:29:26,170
They have six legs?

1917
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:28,840
What the fuck?

1918
01:29:30,649 --> 01:29:31,149
Oh!

1919
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:33,100
Oh!

1920
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:47,640
All right.

1921
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:56,310
Do not be disturbed by progress.

1922
01:30:06,789 --> 01:30:09,130
Okay, Frankenstein.

1923
01:30:09,130 --> 01:30:13,829
I mean, the Dr. Frankenstein, not the monster.

1924
01:30:13,829 --> 01:30:15,989
Frankenstein's monster is the name of that character.

1925
01:30:15,989 --> 01:30:16,789
Stupid.

1926
01:30:16,789 --> 01:30:26,090
All right.

1927
01:30:26,090 --> 01:30:26,729
We know how this works.

1928
01:30:26,729 --> 01:30:28,739
Let's do it.

1929
01:30:28,739 --> 01:30:30,020
I'm very excited.

1930
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:33,539
Book report Andy.

1931
01:30:34,739 --> 01:30:38,180
How many animals do we have left?

1932
01:30:38,180 --> 01:30:38,899
Okay.

1933
01:30:38,899 --> 01:30:41,050
Let's get that incubated.

1934
01:30:41,050 --> 01:30:43,529
Who's hungry?

1935
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:45,319
All right, spam.

1936
01:30:46,649 --> 01:30:49,770
Head up to the designated food room and I want you to eat an onion ring.

1937
01:30:49,770 --> 01:30:51,739
Are you hungry too?

1938
01:30:51,739 --> 01:30:52,300
No, you're okay.

1939
01:30:52,939 --> 01:30:55,260
Oh, Squary's...

1940
01:30:55,260 --> 01:30:55,819
Squary's been...

1941
01:30:55,819 --> 01:30:57,260
Okay, Squary's eating two people now.

1942
01:30:57,260 --> 01:30:57,579
All right.

1943
01:30:57,579 --> 01:30:58,539
E-eat this.

1944
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:02,789
We need Squary to live a long time.

1945
01:31:03,350 --> 01:31:05,939
Take another egg, please.

1946
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:11,350
Squary, then go upstairs after this.

1947
01:31:11,350 --> 01:31:13,100
Oh boy, Squary.

1948
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:14,069
What are you doing?

1949
01:31:14,069 --> 01:31:14,470
You all right?

1950
01:31:19,859 --> 01:31:20,420
Eat that core.

1951
01:31:20,979 --> 01:31:28,470
Go up there.

1952
01:31:28,470 --> 01:31:30,439
What are you doing?

1953
01:31:30,439 --> 01:31:32,439
Oh, you're just having so much trouble.

1954
01:31:32,439 --> 01:31:33,720
What's wrong with this one?

1955
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:37,029
This one can't really walk.

1956
01:31:37,590 --> 01:31:42,390
This one takes a very long time to get anywhere.

1957
01:31:42,390 --> 01:31:43,029
This is sad.

1958
01:31:44,460 --> 01:31:45,100
I'll bring it down.

1959
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:45,579
I'll bring it down.

1960
01:31:45,579 --> 01:31:46,060
I'll bring it down.

1961
01:31:46,619 --> 01:31:52,789
Can I bring it down?

1962
01:31:52,789 --> 01:32:00,149
All right, eat that onion ring.

1963
01:32:00,149 --> 01:32:03,210
Eat it.

1964
01:32:03,210 --> 01:32:10,170
You don't like it?

1965
01:32:12,020 --> 01:32:12,819
You look like you like it.

1966
01:32:12,819 --> 01:32:13,460
You don't like it?

1967
01:32:16,810 --> 01:32:17,449
Okay.

1968
01:32:17,449 --> 01:32:19,770
I don't...

1969
01:32:19,770 --> 01:32:22,090
Oh, he puked.

1970
01:32:22,090 --> 01:32:22,890
Why did he puke?

1971
01:32:24,329 --> 01:32:24,890
Okay, wait.

1972
01:32:24,890 --> 01:32:25,130
Why?

1973
01:32:25,130 --> 01:32:25,850
Why did you puke?

1974
01:32:26,409 --> 01:32:27,130
Are you all right?

1975
01:32:27,689 --> 01:32:28,409
Oh, shit.

1976
01:32:30,409 --> 01:32:30,729
No, no.

1977
01:32:30,729 --> 01:32:31,449
Don't eat the puke.

1978
01:32:32,890 --> 01:32:35,140
Oh, what's wrong with it?

1979
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:35,939
You don't like onion ring.

1980
01:32:35,939 --> 01:32:37,140
Don't eat teeth and puke.

1981
01:32:39,180 --> 01:32:39,739
I don't know.

1982
01:32:39,739 --> 01:32:40,619
Didn't like the onion ring.

1983
01:32:44,250 --> 01:32:44,890
Oh, okay.

1984
01:32:44,890 --> 01:32:45,449
Are you all right?

1985
01:32:48,250 --> 01:32:49,210
Here, have a coconut.

1986
01:32:49,210 --> 01:32:50,010
That's like nutritious.

1987
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:55,060
Sweating.

1988
01:32:55,060 --> 01:32:55,539
What's wrong?

1989
01:32:56,569 --> 01:33:00,810
Lazy doesn't care for food and rude.

1990
01:33:01,369 --> 01:33:03,619
How are you going to stay alive?

1991
01:33:03,619 --> 01:33:04,739
You don't like food?

1992
01:33:04,739 --> 01:33:04,979
What?

1993
01:33:06,810 --> 01:33:07,130
Uh-oh.

1994
01:33:07,770 --> 01:33:09,899
Eat the coconut?

1995
01:33:11,479 --> 01:33:14,520
Lazy, rude, and doesn't eat food.

1996
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:19,430
Okay.

1997
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:28,710
How about just raw?

1998
01:33:28,710 --> 01:33:32,460
Here we go.

1999
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:38,439
I got to put some of this food down here.

2000
01:33:38,439 --> 01:33:39,079
Is it like rotten?

2001
01:33:39,079 --> 01:33:39,720
Is that the problem?

2002
01:33:40,279 --> 01:33:45,770
How do I lift stuff up?

2003
01:33:45,770 --> 01:33:49,479
Is there a way I can lift this up vertically?

2004
01:33:49,479 --> 01:33:50,600
I know there's a way.

2005
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:51,479
There it is.

2006
01:33:51,479 --> 01:33:56,409
Everyone start eating food, please.

2007
01:33:58,840 --> 01:33:59,560
Alien fruit.

2008
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:00,199
Somebody eat it.

2009
01:34:03,779 --> 01:34:04,340
Moon cheese.

2010
01:34:04,340 --> 01:34:05,220
Somebody eat it.

2011
01:34:05,220 --> 01:34:14,229
Okay, there we go.

2012
01:34:14,229 --> 01:34:15,270
You eat the alien fruit.

2013
01:34:15,270 --> 01:34:16,789
I feel like that should be what you should be doing.

2014
01:34:20,140 --> 01:34:20,939
Raw.

2015
01:34:20,939 --> 01:34:22,630
Just hungry.

2016
01:34:23,189 --> 01:34:24,550
What just happened?

2017
01:34:24,550 --> 01:34:25,670
What's going on?

2018
01:34:26,310 --> 01:34:27,029
What's wrong with everybody?

2019
01:34:27,670 --> 01:34:30,569
Why are you all wet?

2020
01:34:31,369 --> 01:34:32,869
Eat that like cheese.

2021
01:34:37,369 --> 01:34:38,090
The stock.

2022
01:34:40,119 --> 01:34:42,840
Okay, has Squary been asleep for like a week?

2023
01:34:58,979 --> 01:34:59,619
Oh my god.

2024
01:34:59,619 --> 01:35:00,500
This is so sad.

2025
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:01,859
I don't think this is...

2026
01:35:01,859 --> 01:35:02,739
I don't think...

2027
01:35:02,739 --> 01:35:03,779
I don't think rock and walk.

2028
01:35:05,319 --> 01:35:05,560
Here.

2029
01:35:08,260 --> 01:35:08,739
Eat that.

2030
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:12,979
You like it?

2031
01:35:14,229 --> 01:35:14,470
Okay.

2032
01:35:18,229 --> 01:35:19,270
Half eaten food.

2033
01:35:21,779 --> 01:35:22,659
Oh, you're ready to mutate.

2034
01:35:22,659 --> 01:35:22,979
Let's go.

2035
01:35:23,619 --> 01:35:28,520
Why are they all wet?

2036
01:35:29,399 --> 01:35:33,609
I don't understand.

2037
01:35:33,609 --> 01:35:35,340
Why are they wet?

2038
01:35:36,060 --> 01:35:37,220
They're all wet.

2039
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:44,890
There's no AC.

2040
01:35:45,609 --> 01:35:46,729
He doesn't like it.

2041
01:35:46,729 --> 01:35:47,850
He threw up.

2042
01:35:47,850 --> 01:35:48,409
What?

2043
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:54,090
Who's even alive?

2044
01:35:54,649 --> 01:35:56,090
Oh, okay, you're fine.

2045
01:35:57,289 --> 01:35:58,250
Let me get you a...

2046
01:35:58,250 --> 01:35:59,289
All right, hold on.

2047
01:35:59,289 --> 01:36:01,609
Hatcho mutated a dog with more than four legs.

2048
01:36:01,609 --> 01:36:02,170
Honeycomb.

2049
01:36:03,609 --> 01:36:08,649
Hopefully you mutated into something.

2050
01:36:10,619 --> 01:36:11,180
Oh, you got...

2051
01:36:11,180 --> 01:36:11,739
It's huge.

2052
01:36:12,619 --> 01:36:13,020
Huge.

2053
01:36:14,890 --> 01:36:15,770
And what else?

2054
01:36:18,729 --> 01:36:19,449
34%.

2055
01:36:23,479 --> 01:36:25,159
Doesn't care for food.

2056
01:36:25,159 --> 01:36:27,000
Lazy and is rude.

2057
01:36:27,640 --> 01:36:30,939
Can this dog even fit in the house?

2058
01:36:30,939 --> 01:36:39,960
All right, yeah.

2059
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:41,239
Go get some sleep.

2060
01:36:41,239 --> 01:36:48,300
Okay, who else?

2061
01:36:48,300 --> 01:36:49,770
You guys are doing fine over here.

2062
01:36:50,409 --> 01:36:53,079
All right.

2063
01:36:53,479 --> 01:36:54,920
Should I do more breeding?

2064
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:59,420
I'm gonna have to breed these two again.

2065
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:06,460
And this time we're going to take them to zero.

2066
01:37:08,199 --> 01:37:08,760
Oh, okay.

2067
01:37:09,399 --> 01:37:11,800
They sound like snakes.

2068
01:37:12,439 --> 01:37:21,909
How about...

2069
01:37:22,550 --> 01:37:24,890
Yeah, let's do it.

2070
01:37:24,890 --> 01:37:28,890
You should import somebody else's dog.

2071
01:37:28,890 --> 01:37:30,090
Well, hold on now.

2072
01:37:30,090 --> 01:37:30,810
Not quite.

2073
01:37:38,260 --> 01:37:38,739
Salmon.

2074
01:37:43,270 --> 01:37:45,270
Okay, what does the stability actually mean?

2075
01:37:46,739 --> 01:37:47,539
Can somebody help me out with that?

2076
01:37:47,539 --> 01:37:48,739
What does that realistically mean?

2077
01:37:56,939 --> 01:37:59,260
Less stability equals more mutations.

2078
01:37:59,260 --> 01:38:00,380
Oh, okay.

2079
01:38:00,380 --> 01:38:07,220
That's how crazy it is.

2080
01:38:08,250 --> 01:38:09,130
Oh, we got an orange.

2081
01:38:10,899 --> 01:38:11,460
Orange dog.

2082
01:38:12,180 --> 01:38:22,569
All right, we're gonna get an orange.

2083
01:38:23,289 --> 01:38:23,770
It's huge.

2084
01:38:30,409 --> 01:38:31,289
All right, we're getting weird.

2085
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:34,039
Again?

2086
01:38:40,250 --> 01:38:41,819
What happened?

2087
01:38:41,819 --> 01:38:51,699
We lost some along the way here.

2088
01:38:51,699 --> 01:38:52,819
All right, they're not that...

2089
01:38:52,819 --> 01:38:54,100
They don't look that bad.

2090
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:59,369
They look actually pretty healthy.

2091
01:39:00,010 --> 01:39:07,239
They still look actually perfectly fine.

2092
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:18,439
How about these two?

2093
01:39:18,439 --> 01:39:21,079
34% stability, but they look all right.

2094
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:24,359
All right, maybe one more.

2095
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:35,000
All right, look at this one.

2096
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,159
Orange and green and looks very strong.

2097
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:42,199
Keep doing it.

2098
01:39:42,199 --> 01:39:43,159
Go to zero.

2099
01:39:53,140 --> 01:39:53,460
Again?

2100
01:40:01,989 --> 01:40:16,260
All right, this is where it's zero.

2101
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:16,899
We're good.

2102
01:40:16,899 --> 01:40:25,239
Oh, yeah.

2103
01:40:25,239 --> 01:40:31,899
I got an achievement for that.

2104
01:40:33,079 --> 01:40:41,899
You got the perfect dog.

2105
01:40:41,899 --> 01:40:47,579
I think I'm getting some cool stuff here.

2106
01:40:47,579 --> 01:40:53,130
Okay, get a litter in the...

2107
01:40:53,130 --> 01:40:55,289
Get a tiny litter in the breeding simulation.

2108
01:40:55,289 --> 01:40:56,010
Okay, an egg.

2109
01:40:57,079 --> 01:40:58,039
And then what do I get for this?

2110
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:00,119
Simulated floor.

2111
01:41:02,779 --> 01:41:03,420
Cool.

2112
01:41:03,420 --> 01:41:05,020
All right, let's get that egg in there.

2113
01:41:07,449 --> 01:41:13,930
All right, spam is...

2114
01:41:14,890 --> 01:41:16,170
I don't think I want to breed spam.

2115
01:41:16,729 --> 01:41:19,060
I think we just let spam die.

2116
01:41:20,020 --> 01:41:22,789
Because, you know what I mean?

2117
01:41:22,789 --> 01:41:24,939
It's not looking great.

2118
01:41:34,710 --> 01:41:35,109
Sad.

2119
01:41:35,670 --> 01:41:37,340
What the fuck?

2120
01:41:37,340 --> 01:41:38,619
Oh, this is the playroom, right?

2121
01:41:38,619 --> 01:41:43,159
You're going to have fun in the playroom?

2122
01:41:43,159 --> 01:41:44,439
Yeah, go play with this.

2123
01:41:44,439 --> 01:41:45,720
Go bite that.

2124
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:52,090
Here we go.

2125
01:41:52,090 --> 01:41:53,720
All right, how about...

2126
01:41:59,220 --> 01:42:00,180
Creamsicle.

2127
01:42:00,180 --> 01:42:15,619
Butter?

2128
01:42:15,619 --> 01:42:16,119
No.

2129
01:42:17,220 --> 01:42:18,710
Carrot.

2130
01:42:18,710 --> 01:42:19,430
No.

2131
01:42:19,430 --> 01:42:21,590
Cheese, brick.

2132
01:42:21,590 --> 01:42:25,289
Butterscotch.

2133
01:42:25,289 --> 01:42:35,079
Sherbert.

2134
01:42:35,079 --> 01:42:38,899
All right, Sherbert.

2135
01:42:38,899 --> 01:42:40,579
I want to feed you really weird shit,

2136
01:42:40,579 --> 01:42:41,300
so I want you to come...

2137
01:42:41,699 --> 01:42:42,819
Are you able to walk?

2138
01:42:42,819 --> 01:42:47,369
How are you doing?

2139
01:42:47,369 --> 01:42:49,050
Some dogs eat to live.

2140
01:42:49,050 --> 01:42:50,779
This one lives to eat.

2141
01:42:50,779 --> 01:42:52,220
Not very interested in other dogs.

2142
01:42:53,850 --> 01:42:54,569
And lazy.

2143
01:42:56,409 --> 01:42:57,770
Why are they all so lazy?

2144
01:42:57,770 --> 01:42:59,289
Look, they can't even do anything.

2145
01:42:59,289 --> 01:43:00,090
It takes them so long.

2146
01:43:02,250 --> 01:43:03,529
All right, what do I want to feed you?

2147
01:43:05,060 --> 01:43:05,699
Something.

2148
01:43:05,699 --> 01:43:07,670
Oh, mud.

2149
01:43:07,670 --> 01:43:08,470
How are you doing?

2150
01:43:08,470 --> 01:43:09,779
You want some food, mud?

2151
01:43:11,460 --> 01:43:12,500
How about a ham slider?

2152
01:43:12,500 --> 01:43:13,220
Let's try that one.

2153
01:43:13,939 --> 01:43:14,789
Good to go.

2154
01:43:17,850 --> 01:43:18,250
Try this.

2155
01:43:18,810 --> 01:43:24,659
You like ham?

2156
01:43:24,659 --> 01:43:25,430
You do?

2157
01:43:25,430 --> 01:43:26,310
All right, good.

2158
01:43:26,310 --> 01:43:32,140
All right, I want something weird here.

2159
01:43:34,020 --> 01:43:34,659
Alien fruit.

2160
01:43:37,420 --> 01:43:41,289
I'm going to feed that to the guy we just came up with.

2161
01:43:43,829 --> 01:43:52,380
Get in there.

2162
01:43:55,449 --> 01:43:58,859
Where's the fruit?

2163
01:43:58,859 --> 01:44:01,640
What happened?

2164
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:11,659
Climb.

2165
01:44:11,659 --> 01:44:14,819
This takes a while here.

2166
01:44:14,819 --> 01:44:15,460
Come on.

2167
01:44:15,460 --> 01:44:19,430
All right, where did the fruit go?

2168
01:44:21,699 --> 01:44:23,060
Where did that alien fruit...

2169
01:44:23,060 --> 01:44:24,100
I don't understand.

2170
01:44:24,100 --> 01:44:25,989
It's just gone.

2171
01:44:25,989 --> 01:44:26,869
It just doesn't exist.

2172
01:44:26,869 --> 01:44:33,850
All right, give that a try.

2173
01:44:33,850 --> 01:44:38,939
What did you get?

2174
01:44:38,939 --> 01:44:40,819
Coconuts?

2175
01:44:40,819 --> 01:44:45,319
Oh, Spam actually likes coconuts.

2176
01:44:45,319 --> 01:44:46,199
That's insane.

2177
01:44:46,199 --> 01:44:48,500
Spam hates food.

2178
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:50,840
Okay, Spam likes coconuts.

2179
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:53,779
That's very important to remember.

2180
01:44:53,779 --> 01:45:02,380
I don't have any den upgrades.

2181
01:45:02,380 --> 01:45:05,750
Okay, eat this like tooth, too.

2182
01:45:05,750 --> 01:45:13,340
All right, raw.

2183
01:45:13,340 --> 01:45:14,060
What do we get?

2184
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:25,050
All right, got a little more green.

2185
01:45:25,050 --> 01:45:25,850
Legs got bigger.

2186
01:45:25,850 --> 01:45:26,489
Legs got...

2187
01:45:26,489 --> 01:45:28,090
Actually, this might actually help a lot.

2188
01:45:28,090 --> 01:45:34,500
Do you want to eat like a tooth or something?

2189
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:46,890
Here, eat this stuff.

2190
01:45:46,890 --> 01:45:47,850
They're all so slow.

2191
01:45:47,850 --> 01:45:53,100
They all can't even move.

2192
01:45:53,100 --> 01:45:53,420
They all...

2193
01:45:53,420 --> 01:45:53,979
Look at how...

2194
01:45:53,979 --> 01:45:55,899
Okay, this is the only one that actually walks.

2195
01:45:55,899 --> 01:46:02,060
Go eat a banana.

2196
01:46:02,060 --> 01:46:02,699
Cool.

2197
01:46:02,699 --> 01:46:03,500
How are you doing?

2198
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:06,020
Very nice.

2199
01:46:06,020 --> 01:46:07,670
Probably need some sleep.

2200
01:46:07,670 --> 01:46:08,630
Go eat some more ham.

2201
01:46:08,630 --> 01:46:18,229
Eat whatever.

2202
01:46:18,229 --> 01:46:18,869
I don't want to do that.

2203
01:46:18,869 --> 01:46:19,670
All right, well, don't.

2204
01:46:19,670 --> 01:46:28,630
This costs money because Spam just keeps eating coconuts over and over again.

2205
01:46:28,630 --> 01:46:33,939
Go eat this like moon cheese thing.

2206
01:46:33,939 --> 01:46:35,460
I want to see some mutations, please.

2207
01:46:35,460 --> 01:46:45,720
But didn't I unlock a new food?

2208
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:54,220
All right, raw's asleep.

2209
01:46:55,859 --> 01:47:02,039
Can I breed anybody?

2210
01:47:02,039 --> 01:47:02,920
Go to bed.

2211
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:07,590
I can, but I don't want to yet.

2212
01:47:07,590 --> 01:47:22,949
Everyone's tired.

2213
01:47:22,949 --> 01:47:24,520
Iron fence.

2214
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:25,159
Fence.

2215
01:47:25,159 --> 01:47:31,779
The good thing is nobody's like kind of...

2216
01:47:31,779 --> 01:47:32,340
Nobody's...

2217
01:47:32,340 --> 01:47:33,460
Everyone's pretty happy.

2218
01:47:33,460 --> 01:47:43,079
Still a few that I haven't found yet.

2219
01:47:43,079 --> 01:47:43,960
A lot, actually.

2220
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:46,819
Stop destroying the dirt.

2221
01:47:46,819 --> 01:47:48,729
What does the dirt do?

2222
01:47:48,729 --> 01:47:49,369
Why?

2223
01:47:49,369 --> 01:47:52,539
You have to name somebody Macho.

2224
01:47:52,539 --> 01:47:54,390
That's a good idea.

2225
01:47:54,390 --> 01:47:59,859
Put the dirt clumps in the dirt patch.

2226
01:47:59,859 --> 01:48:15,210
What's that stick bug meme?

2227
01:48:15,210 --> 01:48:16,250
Foam cylinder.

2228
01:48:16,250 --> 01:48:18,600
What are you doing?

2229
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:21,779
Get out of here.

2230
01:48:21,779 --> 01:48:23,220
What the fuck are you doing?

2231
01:48:23,220 --> 01:48:28,250
Stop doing that.

2232
01:48:28,250 --> 01:48:29,479
Don't do that.

2233
01:48:29,479 --> 01:48:32,899
You just woke up your brother.

2234
01:48:32,899 --> 01:48:38,579
Okay, fine.

2235
01:48:38,579 --> 01:48:43,590
Roll over.

2236
01:48:43,590 --> 01:48:44,550
No, you didn't.

2237
01:48:44,550 --> 01:48:45,430
Roll over.

2238
01:48:45,430 --> 01:48:51,750
See, I did it.

2239
01:48:51,750 --> 01:48:52,550
Good job.

2240
01:48:52,550 --> 01:48:58,949
Oh, an egg.

2241
01:48:58,949 --> 01:49:09,850
Does anybody know any tricks?

2242
01:49:09,850 --> 01:49:11,420
Can you do a roll over?

2243
01:49:11,420 --> 01:49:12,539
Wow, you can do it.

2244
01:49:12,539 --> 01:49:13,340
Mud's smart.

2245
01:49:13,340 --> 01:49:18,090
All right, mud.

2246
01:49:18,090 --> 01:49:19,289
Um, you need to go to bed.

2247
01:49:19,289 --> 01:49:23,050
Do you know anything?

2248
01:49:23,050 --> 01:49:29,449
Can you do a roll over?

2249
01:49:29,449 --> 01:49:30,250
You can, wow.

2250
01:49:30,250 --> 01:49:31,369
Actually, they're pretty smart.

2251
01:49:31,369 --> 01:49:37,460
All right, you need to go in here now.

2252
01:49:37,460 --> 01:49:40,819
Just go sleep somewhere.

2253
01:49:40,819 --> 01:49:41,699
Sleep right here.

2254
01:49:41,699 --> 01:49:45,380
Stay away from the incubator.

2255
01:49:45,380 --> 01:49:47,750
That's not for dogs.

2256
01:49:47,750 --> 01:49:52,329
All right, you want to eat.

2257
01:49:52,329 --> 01:49:53,449
You need to mutate, too.

2258
01:49:53,449 --> 01:49:56,710
Eat this like weird cheese.

2259
01:49:56,710 --> 01:50:01,319
Feed somebody a cocoon.

2260
01:50:01,319 --> 01:50:08,439
I can't wait to breed this.

2261
01:50:08,439 --> 01:50:12,970
Sir, hello.

2262
01:50:12,970 --> 01:50:14,329
I'm writing an article for my school paper.

2263
01:50:14,329 --> 01:50:15,369
Would you like to give an explanation

2264
01:50:15,369 --> 01:50:16,729
for the events that occurred three days ago

2265
01:50:16,729 --> 01:50:18,090
during the strawberry magic stream?

2266
01:50:19,449 --> 01:50:20,569
What do you want to know?

2267
01:50:20,569 --> 01:50:23,000
Okay, good.

2268
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:23,770
Sleep.

2269
01:50:24,489 --> 01:50:25,130
Where are you?

2270
01:50:25,770 --> 01:50:27,699
Where is this?

2271
01:50:28,810 --> 01:50:29,449
No, not yet.

2272
01:50:38,979 --> 01:50:41,220
And all right, what happened?

2273
01:50:41,779 --> 01:50:47,880
Not much.

2274
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:48,840
Just kind of grew up a little bit.

2275
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:56,539
All right, so somebody said don't fuck with the dirt, right?

2276
01:50:56,539 --> 01:51:00,649
Just leave the dirt.

2277
01:51:00,649 --> 01:51:04,979
But did you find this?

2278
01:51:04,979 --> 01:51:06,500
This was recommended a bunch of times.

2279
01:51:06,500 --> 01:51:09,399
It's been on the list for a little while.

2280
01:51:09,399 --> 01:51:11,350
I think it's cute.

2281
01:51:11,350 --> 01:51:12,149
I think this is fun.

2282
01:51:12,149 --> 01:51:15,670
All right, spam needs to eat.

2283
01:51:17,960 --> 01:51:20,149
What should I feed you?

2284
01:51:20,149 --> 01:51:20,869
I got something new.

2285
01:51:20,869 --> 01:51:23,829
Yeah, honeycomb.

2286
01:51:23,829 --> 01:51:25,689
Try this if you like it.

2287
01:51:25,689 --> 01:51:34,869
You like it?

2288
01:51:34,869 --> 01:51:38,250
Well, you guys both apparently like that.

2289
01:51:38,250 --> 01:51:39,689
So let's just put another one over here.

2290
01:51:39,689 --> 01:51:40,970
Try it again.

2291
01:51:40,970 --> 01:51:44,409
You look more like a sheep than you a dog.

2292
01:51:44,409 --> 01:51:49,880
Hey, anybody else hungry?

2293
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:52,220
It's query.

2294
01:51:53,399 --> 01:51:53,880
Who is this?

2295
01:51:55,189 --> 01:51:57,430
Yeah, you go in there and go to sleep.

2296
01:51:57,430 --> 01:52:01,819
You need to sleep.

2297
01:52:01,819 --> 01:52:02,779
All right, let's rock it.

2298
01:52:02,779 --> 01:52:04,060
Raw, eat a honeycomb.

2299
01:52:04,060 --> 01:52:05,819
I feel like that would like fuck you up.

2300
01:52:05,819 --> 01:52:06,939
Like your DNA or whatever.

2301
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:11,989
It's very nutritious,

2302
01:52:11,989 --> 01:52:13,189
but I feel like it's going to like

2303
01:52:13,189 --> 01:52:14,149
fuck up the DNA stuff.

2304
01:52:14,149 --> 01:52:17,189
It's going to be interesting.

2305
01:52:17,189 --> 01:52:17,909
Sheep.

2306
01:52:17,909 --> 01:52:20,359
All right, now go to sleep.

2307
01:52:21,479 --> 01:52:28,119
Hey, what do we get?

2308
01:52:30,220 --> 01:52:31,020
Berry bros.

2309
01:52:38,470 --> 01:52:45,989
Ooh, just got bigger.

2310
01:52:45,989 --> 01:52:47,350
Body got glossy.

2311
01:52:49,689 --> 01:52:51,050
I think I can breed now.

2312
01:52:51,609 --> 01:52:53,460
Can I?

2313
01:52:53,460 --> 01:52:56,359
No, not yet.

2314
01:52:56,359 --> 01:53:02,939
All right, eat another honeycomb.

2315
01:53:07,829 --> 01:53:08,630
Eat that.

2316
01:53:08,630 --> 01:53:15,159
And then go in the corner and sleep.

2317
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:18,500
Who else should eat this?

2318
01:53:19,220 --> 01:53:22,020
Okay, mud, come out here and eat this.

2319
01:53:22,579 --> 01:53:27,130
I feel like the honeycomb is going to do really cool stuff.

2320
01:53:28,460 --> 01:53:29,340
Spam can breed.

2321
01:53:30,220 --> 01:53:31,100
They're not on the list, are they?

2322
01:53:31,500 --> 01:53:32,380
Oh, we can, can they?

2323
01:53:33,180 --> 01:53:35,420
Not old enough.

2324
01:53:35,420 --> 01:53:38,630
See, not old enough.

2325
01:53:44,729 --> 01:53:46,649
Mud, eat this.

2326
01:53:51,109 --> 01:53:52,949
Light, loud, and aloof.

2327
01:53:52,949 --> 01:53:53,449
That's fine.

2328
01:53:54,470 --> 01:53:57,829
What are you doing?

2329
01:53:57,829 --> 01:53:58,329
You okay?

2330
01:54:03,109 --> 01:54:06,090
How come there's some...

2331
01:54:06,090 --> 01:54:07,210
Why are they sweaty sometimes?

2332
01:54:07,930 --> 01:54:21,159
Dehydrated tree.

2333
01:54:21,159 --> 01:54:22,199
Let's see what this does.

2334
01:54:22,199 --> 01:54:30,819
Eat this.

2335
01:54:30,819 --> 01:54:41,449
You like it?

2336
01:54:41,449 --> 01:54:42,489
Where is everybody?

2337
01:54:42,489 --> 01:54:47,579
Yeah, you're over there.

2338
01:54:47,579 --> 01:54:48,859
You need to eat something too.

2339
01:54:51,579 --> 01:54:52,619
Dry landscape?

2340
01:54:52,619 --> 01:54:53,899
This is kind of getting out of hand.

2341
01:54:53,899 --> 01:54:58,970
Just eat the dirt.

2342
01:54:58,970 --> 01:55:02,260
Or should we?

2343
01:55:02,260 --> 01:55:03,060
No.

2344
01:55:03,060 --> 01:55:05,859
Let's only give spam.

2345
01:55:05,859 --> 01:55:06,420
What are you doing?

2346
01:55:06,420 --> 01:55:12,390
How about a cut fruit?

2347
01:55:12,390 --> 01:55:18,310
I want a lot of different options, genetics-wise.

2348
01:55:18,310 --> 01:55:20,539
All right, try that.

2349
01:55:21,100 --> 01:55:36,260
You don't like it?

2350
01:55:36,260 --> 01:55:39,140
Vents tool option has something for removing plants.

2351
01:55:39,140 --> 01:55:39,640
Okay.

2352
01:55:40,020 --> 01:55:40,819
Oh, you like it.

2353
01:55:40,819 --> 01:55:41,319
You're fine.

2354
01:55:41,779 --> 01:55:45,460
Did I unlock anything new?

2355
01:55:45,460 --> 01:55:49,939
I got something to do flooring.

2356
01:55:51,640 --> 01:55:52,520
Oh, this thing.

2357
01:55:52,520 --> 01:55:54,460
Put it in the playroom.

2358
01:55:54,460 --> 01:56:05,670
That's kind of huge, but whatever.

2359
01:56:05,670 --> 01:56:09,640
Everyone want to check it out?

2360
01:56:09,640 --> 01:56:16,630
All right, you ready to go?

2361
01:56:16,630 --> 01:56:17,659
Go for it.

2362
01:56:17,659 --> 01:56:28,729
Green shag.

2363
01:56:28,729 --> 01:56:29,930
I think now we can breed.

2364
01:56:29,930 --> 01:56:39,130
I'm gonna go try it out.

2365
01:56:39,130 --> 01:56:43,960
Check out the roller.

2366
01:56:43,960 --> 01:56:45,460
Come on, play.

2367
01:56:45,460 --> 01:56:45,939
I just bought it.

2368
01:56:45,939 --> 01:56:51,460
Come on, play with it.

2369
01:56:51,460 --> 01:56:55,720
Play with it.

2370
01:56:55,720 --> 01:57:01,380
They don't even want to play with it.

2371
01:57:01,380 --> 01:57:08,329
Save the game.

2372
01:57:08,329 --> 01:57:08,729
Yep.

2373
01:57:08,729 --> 01:57:15,340
How are you supposed to play with a big tube?

2374
01:57:15,340 --> 01:57:15,659
I don't know.

2375
01:57:15,659 --> 01:57:21,270
Like you get your, you put your arms up and you put your whole body flush with it.

2376
01:57:21,270 --> 01:57:25,960
And then you put your face down, you grip with your hands and you put your entire,

2377
01:57:25,960 --> 01:57:31,479
you kind of mold all around it and then push forward and like roll, roll, roll, roll.

2378
01:57:31,479 --> 01:57:42,979
But you get on top of it and you do like the, like the run thing, like a big log.

2379
01:57:42,979 --> 01:57:43,539
Oh, no.

2380
01:57:43,539 --> 01:57:45,500
Did that, are you okay?

2381
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:46,699
Oh, I don't think you like this.

2382
01:57:47,260 --> 01:57:50,869
Are you having fun?

2383
01:57:56,890 --> 01:58:00,550
I don't think this, I don't think Sherbert's having fun doing this.

2384
01:58:00,550 --> 01:58:02,180
Are you?

2385
01:58:02,180 --> 01:58:02,819
Fight it.

2386
01:58:02,819 --> 01:58:08,180
Yeah, have banana.

2387
01:58:08,180 --> 01:58:24,300
You don't do CBD on stream anymore?

2388
01:58:24,300 --> 01:58:25,180
No, not really.

2389
01:58:25,180 --> 01:58:31,050
Okay, what do you got?

2390
01:58:31,050 --> 01:58:35,479
Longer legs.

2391
01:58:35,479 --> 01:58:36,979
You should.

2392
01:58:36,979 --> 01:58:37,859
No, I shouldn't.

2393
01:58:37,859 --> 01:58:50,699
I told you when, when I was playing Saw 2, I could not read an analog clock and I realized

2394
01:58:50,699 --> 01:58:53,180
can't really take like THC in stream.

2395
01:58:55,159 --> 01:58:56,840
I walked in a circle for like an hour.

2396
01:58:56,840 --> 01:59:03,300
It was for, it was a long time.

2397
01:59:03,300 --> 01:59:11,380
Oh, a caterpillar.

2398
01:59:11,380 --> 01:59:11,939
I gotta pee.

2399
01:59:11,939 --> 01:59:13,560
I'll be right back.

2400
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:14,039
Break time.

2401
02:00:43,350 --> 02:04:46,310
I have returned.

2402
02:04:46,310 --> 02:04:50,359
I wanted to refill my drink too.

2403
02:04:50,359 --> 02:04:51,800
It's hot.

2404
02:04:55,260 --> 02:04:57,239
Crazy thing about Vegas.

2405
02:04:57,239 --> 02:05:04,300
Vegas goes from it being 50 degrees outside to a hundred in three days.

2406
02:05:04,859 --> 02:05:11,560
It's kind of insane.

2407
02:05:17,460 --> 02:05:25,000
Camera, hold on.

2408
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:30,039
Oh, we can see him.

2409
02:05:30,039 --> 02:05:47,319
How's that?

2410
02:05:47,319 --> 02:05:47,720
Is that better?

2411
02:05:52,100 --> 02:05:53,859
Why do I look gray?

2412
02:05:53,859 --> 02:05:57,819
I look fucking gray.

2413
02:05:57,819 --> 02:06:11,819
All right, there we go.

2414
02:06:11,819 --> 02:06:12,140
That's better.

2415
02:06:12,140 --> 02:06:12,539
Okay.

2416
02:06:12,539 --> 02:06:16,069
I said to add some artificial color.

2417
02:06:18,949 --> 02:06:19,750
You guys don't understand.

2418
02:06:19,750 --> 02:06:26,329
It was like with the ring light off and me just sitting here, I'm, I'm fucking gray.

2419
02:06:26,329 --> 02:06:29,689
I have like dark purple eyes and gray skin.

2420
02:06:29,689 --> 02:06:33,899
But yeah, man, we, we, I had a little bit of flush.

2421
02:06:33,899 --> 02:06:41,500
Oh my God.

2422
02:06:41,500 --> 02:06:43,260
I just, what's been happening?

2423
02:06:43,260 --> 02:06:43,819
Everybody okay?

2424
02:06:44,380 --> 02:06:48,939
I don't think it was paused.

2425
02:06:48,939 --> 02:06:51,909
Ooh, wood paneling.

2426
02:06:51,909 --> 02:06:52,869
Oh, okay.

2427
02:06:52,869 --> 02:06:56,199
Ow.

2428
02:06:56,199 --> 02:06:58,869
Anybody ready to breed?

2429
02:06:58,869 --> 02:06:59,670
Not yet.

2430
02:06:59,670 --> 02:07:07,720
Spam is handsome.

2431
02:07:07,720 --> 02:07:13,300
Yes, but actually I didn't like spam in the beginning, but they're, they're growing on me.

2432
02:07:18,729 --> 02:07:20,010
Oh, somebody pee peed.

2433
02:07:20,649 --> 02:07:36,600
Ooh, cool.

2434
02:07:36,600 --> 02:07:40,409
What's that one?

2435
02:07:40,409 --> 02:07:41,850
Very good boy.

2436
02:07:42,569 --> 02:07:44,460
That was so cute.

2437
02:07:44,460 --> 02:07:47,770
It's okay if you have a tiny head.

2438
02:07:47,770 --> 02:07:48,649
That's fine.

2439
02:07:48,649 --> 02:07:50,439
Roll over.

2440
02:07:50,439 --> 02:07:56,100
All right.

2441
02:07:56,100 --> 02:07:57,699
Well, you haven't, you have fun playing with the dirt.

2442
02:07:57,699 --> 02:08:00,010
You really are like an insect.

2443
02:08:00,010 --> 02:08:00,489
Yeah.

2444
02:08:00,489 --> 02:08:04,170
What is it?

2445
02:08:04,170 --> 02:08:05,689
That was very, very good.

2446
02:08:05,689 --> 02:08:07,130
That was very good.

2447
02:08:07,130 --> 02:08:12,279
Spam is hungry.

2448
02:08:12,279 --> 02:08:13,399
Well, let's feed.

2449
02:08:13,399 --> 02:08:17,800
What a chicken nugget or something.

2450
02:08:17,800 --> 02:08:19,720
Yeah, we haven't, we haven't fed a chicken nugget to anybody.

2451
02:08:19,720 --> 02:08:20,840
What are you looking for?

2452
02:08:20,840 --> 02:08:22,409
What do you want mud?

2453
02:08:22,409 --> 02:08:23,289
You hungry?

2454
02:08:23,289 --> 02:08:25,270
You want something from in here?

2455
02:08:25,270 --> 02:08:29,960
Dehydrated treat.

2456
02:08:29,960 --> 02:08:30,600
What do you want?

2457
02:08:30,600 --> 02:08:35,800
How about an onion ring?

2458
02:08:35,800 --> 02:08:36,920
Oh, you want cheese.

2459
02:08:36,920 --> 02:08:37,720
Okay.

2460
02:08:37,720 --> 02:08:40,920
What about onion ring?

2461
02:08:40,920 --> 02:08:43,930
Yeah.

2462
02:08:43,930 --> 02:08:53,659
Right.

2463
02:08:53,659 --> 02:08:56,100
Oh, I don't know.

2464
02:08:56,100 --> 02:08:57,859
Why did that clip take off so much?

2465
02:08:57,859 --> 02:08:59,140
I don't, I don't understand.

2466
02:08:59,140 --> 02:09:01,909
It's the onion ring thing.

2467
02:09:01,909 --> 02:09:02,390
I don't know.

2468
02:09:02,390 --> 02:09:03,829
Why did they take off so much?

2469
02:09:03,829 --> 02:09:07,220
Grandma, I love you, but what the fuck is this game?

2470
02:09:07,220 --> 02:09:10,100
This is Wobble Dogs and it's on Steam and it is very cute.

2471
02:09:10,100 --> 02:09:16,060
It's very fun and it's fun to play.

2472
02:09:16,060 --> 02:09:16,779
It's just chill.

2473
02:09:17,579 --> 02:09:19,180
I like games like this a lot of times.

2474
02:09:19,180 --> 02:09:20,939
It's just cool to hang out and just play.

2475
02:09:20,939 --> 02:09:27,590
It's a genuine human emotion.

2476
02:09:27,590 --> 02:09:32,489
That's why I mean, this is fun.

2477
02:09:33,050 --> 02:09:34,250
All right.

2478
02:09:34,250 --> 02:09:35,369
Who wants a chicken nugget?

2479
02:09:35,930 --> 02:09:49,899
Are you, you're not eating him, aren't you?

2480
02:09:49,899 --> 02:09:50,859
Earned out car.

2481
02:09:50,859 --> 02:09:52,140
Why would I want to use that?

2482
02:09:52,140 --> 02:10:00,710
You want, you want chicken nugget?

2483
02:10:00,710 --> 02:10:07,739
Oh, this is my chicken nugget.

2484
02:10:07,739 --> 02:10:09,819
That's so, I love that.

2485
02:10:09,819 --> 02:10:13,880
I don't want to eat it.

2486
02:10:13,880 --> 02:10:15,640
I just want to take it with me.

2487
02:10:15,640 --> 02:10:23,029
Well, where are you taking it?

2488
02:10:23,029 --> 02:10:27,300
You should, oh, I, oh, I think,

2489
02:10:27,300 --> 02:10:29,939
I think he's taking it away from everybody

2490
02:10:29,939 --> 02:10:31,380
because he wants to eat in private.

2491
02:10:32,340 --> 02:10:32,579
Yep.

2492
02:10:32,579 --> 02:10:33,140
There he goes.

2493
02:10:37,029 --> 02:10:37,510
Yeah.

2494
02:10:37,510 --> 02:10:39,029
He wants to eat in private.

2495
02:10:42,520 --> 02:10:43,560
You all right?

2496
02:10:43,560 --> 02:10:46,970
How much more private can you get?

2497
02:10:52,789 --> 02:10:53,430
I like mud.

2498
02:11:01,510 --> 02:11:01,829
Yeah.

2499
02:11:02,899 --> 02:11:03,619
What was that?

2500
02:11:06,920 --> 02:11:16,810
Oh, you're going to bury the chicken nugget.

2501
02:11:16,810 --> 02:11:17,609
You should eat it.

2502
02:11:17,609 --> 02:11:21,939
I'm not going to tell him what to do.

2503
02:11:21,939 --> 02:11:22,500
Okay.

2504
02:11:22,500 --> 02:11:27,220
No, you should eat it.

2505
02:11:27,220 --> 02:11:31,369
Eat it because you're hungry.

2506
02:11:31,369 --> 02:11:39,350
Oh, ready for a mutation.

2507
02:11:39,350 --> 02:11:41,670
Sherbert takes a long time to level up here.

2508
02:11:41,670 --> 02:11:42,470
All right.

2509
02:11:42,470 --> 02:11:48,489
What have we got?

2510
02:11:48,489 --> 02:11:49,210
Smaller.

2511
02:11:49,210 --> 02:11:54,789
I think you got smaller.

2512
02:11:54,789 --> 02:11:56,699
Yeah.

2513
02:11:56,699 --> 02:11:57,500
Lower body length.

2514
02:11:57,500 --> 02:12:03,779
A little bit longer legs.

2515
02:12:03,779 --> 02:12:05,380
What happens now to spam?

2516
02:12:05,380 --> 02:12:12,229
He's becoming human.

2517
02:12:12,229 --> 02:12:21,140
Oh, Jesus.

2518
02:12:21,140 --> 02:12:25,340
Even bigger.

2519
02:12:25,340 --> 02:12:28,699
Snout rotation.

2520
02:12:28,699 --> 02:12:30,310
No, actually didn't get bigger.

2521
02:12:30,310 --> 02:12:38,579
Lost a little bit of length in the front but got a little wider.

2522
02:12:38,579 --> 02:12:45,020
Oh, no, no, no.

2523
02:12:46,020 --> 02:12:47,619
But how do we?

2524
02:12:47,619 --> 02:12:48,500
It's okay.

2525
02:12:48,500 --> 02:12:55,369
This is sad.

2526
02:12:55,369 --> 02:12:56,329
I liked mud.

2527
02:12:56,329 --> 02:13:05,720
Okay.

2528
02:13:05,720 --> 02:13:06,439
Mud.

2529
02:13:06,439 --> 02:13:22,739
We're going to breed mud and spam.

2530
02:13:22,739 --> 02:13:24,020
Massive litter.

2531
02:13:24,020 --> 02:13:25,909
Oh, what's that mean?

2532
02:13:25,909 --> 02:13:29,699
I don't know.

2533
02:13:29,699 --> 02:13:30,500
What should we do?

2534
02:13:30,500 --> 02:13:35,560
Should I keep going?

2535
02:13:35,560 --> 02:13:37,449
Should I make a huge dog?

2536
02:13:37,449 --> 02:13:49,739
I don't know.

2537
02:13:49,739 --> 02:13:50,859
Wrong one.

2538
02:13:50,859 --> 02:13:58,840
This one and this one back here has brown ears.

2539
02:13:58,840 --> 02:13:59,640
Let's do that.

2540
02:13:59,640 --> 02:14:03,750
Very cool.

2541
02:14:03,750 --> 02:14:04,069
All right.

2542
02:14:04,550 --> 02:14:05,750
Look at huge eyes.

2543
02:14:05,750 --> 02:14:05,989
All right.

2544
02:14:05,989 --> 02:14:06,310
This one.

2545
02:14:06,310 --> 02:14:06,869
I like this one.

2546
02:14:06,869 --> 02:14:07,590
I want this one.

2547
02:14:07,590 --> 02:14:09,189
I don't want to do anymore.

2548
02:14:09,189 --> 02:14:10,069
This one right here.

2549
02:14:10,069 --> 02:14:12,119
That's the one.

2550
02:14:12,119 --> 02:14:18,460
That's the one.

2551
02:14:18,460 --> 02:14:22,659
This next one I'm going to just go absolutely nuts.

2552
02:14:26,489 --> 02:14:29,739
Don't crack mud's orb.

2553
02:14:29,739 --> 02:14:31,500
Oh, I can memorialize it, right?

2554
02:14:31,500 --> 02:14:43,500
Okay.

2555
02:14:43,500 --> 02:14:44,380
Now we're going to do mud.

2556
02:14:45,899 --> 02:14:47,100
No, we're not going to do mud.

2557
02:14:47,100 --> 02:14:59,479
We'll do squary and spam.

2558
02:14:59,479 --> 02:14:59,800
Whoa.

2559
02:15:00,619 --> 02:15:01,420
Tiny.

2560
02:15:01,420 --> 02:15:09,430
Should I do one of the tiny ones?

2561
02:15:09,430 --> 02:15:13,399
Oh, these don't look that good.

2562
02:15:13,399 --> 02:15:17,899
They're kind of big and small.

2563
02:15:21,369 --> 02:15:22,649
You're having way more fun.

2564
02:15:22,649 --> 02:15:23,689
Actually, but you're bigger.

2565
02:15:23,770 --> 02:15:35,510
Oh, God.

2566
02:15:42,779 --> 02:15:48,899
And this one.

2567
02:15:48,899 --> 02:15:49,539
Oh, God.

2568
02:15:49,539 --> 02:15:50,579
Look at this one.

2569
02:15:50,579 --> 02:15:53,340
Cool.

2570
02:15:53,340 --> 02:15:53,739
All right.

2571
02:15:53,739 --> 02:15:57,000
This one and this.

2572
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:57,880
The two big ones.

2573
02:15:57,880 --> 02:16:01,020
Now we'll do the little ones.

2574
02:16:01,020 --> 02:16:07,239
This one looks cool.

2575
02:16:14,380 --> 02:16:15,859
Huge.

2576
02:16:15,859 --> 02:16:16,100
All right.

2577
02:16:16,100 --> 02:16:28,979
Now we're going to do the two huge ones.

2578
02:16:28,979 --> 02:16:29,939
Look at how big this one's head.

2579
02:16:29,939 --> 02:16:32,469
Look at this one's huge nose.

2580
02:16:32,469 --> 02:16:33,620
That one.

2581
02:16:33,620 --> 02:16:35,700
Look at how huge this one's nose is.

2582
02:16:35,700 --> 02:16:46,420
No, I like that one.

2583
02:16:46,420 --> 02:16:48,899
I don't want any no different.

2584
02:16:48,899 --> 02:16:49,299
I want it.

2585
02:16:49,299 --> 02:16:50,100
I want that one.

2586
02:16:50,100 --> 02:16:54,090
What is this?

2587
02:16:54,090 --> 02:16:55,940
Where did I get a ball?

2588
02:16:55,940 --> 02:17:03,780
Where's mud?

2589
02:17:03,780 --> 02:17:06,979
They said mud was close to passing away, right?

2590
02:17:06,979 --> 02:17:09,750
Hey, just go to sleep.

2591
02:17:10,309 --> 02:17:10,549
Yeah.

2592
02:17:10,549 --> 02:17:11,829
Mud, go to sleep over here.

2593
02:17:11,829 --> 02:17:14,090
You want like a treat or something?

2594
02:17:14,090 --> 02:17:16,069
Just go lie down over here.

2595
02:17:16,069 --> 02:17:22,149
You can lie down.

2596
02:17:22,149 --> 02:17:23,420
Go on.

2597
02:17:23,420 --> 02:17:23,739
Yeah.

2598
02:17:23,739 --> 02:17:24,219
There you go.

2599
02:17:24,780 --> 02:17:39,450
You should lie down.

2600
02:17:39,450 --> 02:17:40,170
Oh.

2601
02:17:40,170 --> 02:17:44,709
Squarry wants to be with mud at the end here.

2602
02:17:44,709 --> 02:17:46,629
Oh, this is so sad.

2603
02:17:46,629 --> 02:18:00,069
Hey, we're friends.

2604
02:18:00,069 --> 02:18:01,510
Get a massive litter.

2605
02:18:01,510 --> 02:18:02,229
Industrial.

2606
02:18:02,229 --> 02:18:03,510
Ooh, that's probably good.

2607
02:18:04,069 --> 02:18:05,110
Pull them down.

2608
02:18:05,110 --> 02:18:07,079
Okay.

2609
02:18:07,079 --> 02:18:16,709
Well, we're going to leave mud alone.

2610
02:18:16,709 --> 02:18:17,829
Don't eat that shit.

2611
02:18:17,829 --> 02:18:21,719
Stop eating poop.

2612
02:18:21,719 --> 02:18:22,760
Don't eat poop.

2613
02:18:22,760 --> 02:18:23,799
Don't eat poop.

2614
02:18:23,799 --> 02:18:32,340
All right.

2615
02:18:32,340 --> 02:18:32,979
Everyone's hungry.

2616
02:18:37,399 --> 02:18:39,819
What are you looking for?

2617
02:18:39,819 --> 02:18:41,020
No, no like weird shit.

2618
02:18:41,020 --> 02:18:41,899
Just like a burrito.

2619
02:18:41,899 --> 02:18:42,299
We haven't had it.

2620
02:18:42,299 --> 02:18:46,010
Nobody's had a burrito in a while.

2621
02:18:46,010 --> 02:18:46,969
Here, eat this burrito.

2622
02:18:48,420 --> 02:18:50,659
And we'll spawn some like coconuts.

2623
02:18:50,659 --> 02:18:55,879
A little piece of cheese.

2624
02:18:55,879 --> 02:18:56,840
Maybe some french fries.

2625
02:18:57,959 --> 02:18:58,200
Yeah.

2626
02:18:58,200 --> 02:19:01,299
And come up here and eat if you want to eat.

2627
02:19:01,299 --> 02:19:06,340
Eat that burrito.

2628
02:19:06,340 --> 02:19:08,340
Oh, I love the nose.

2629
02:19:08,340 --> 02:19:16,629
How about like schnoz or something?

2630
02:19:16,629 --> 02:19:18,629
Spud?

2631
02:19:18,629 --> 02:19:21,239
Actually, Spud's a good name.

2632
02:19:21,239 --> 02:19:22,979
Spud.

2633
02:19:22,979 --> 02:19:25,559
I love Spud.

2634
02:19:25,559 --> 02:19:25,799
Okay.

2635
02:19:25,799 --> 02:19:31,819
How's it going in here?

2636
02:19:31,819 --> 02:19:35,110
Mud's still okay.

2637
02:19:35,110 --> 02:19:39,159
You want to have some food, mud?

2638
02:19:39,159 --> 02:19:40,280
Defying all odds.

2639
02:19:40,280 --> 02:19:42,120
Mud is still alive.

2640
02:19:42,120 --> 02:19:45,020
Interesting.

2641
02:19:45,020 --> 02:19:48,709
You seriously can't go that far?

2642
02:19:48,709 --> 02:19:49,829
Oh my goodness.

2643
02:19:49,829 --> 02:19:50,389
There you go.

2644
02:19:50,389 --> 02:19:54,149
Eat it.

2645
02:19:54,149 --> 02:19:55,750
And eat like a banana or something too.

2646
02:19:55,750 --> 02:19:57,180
A coconut.

2647
02:19:57,180 --> 02:20:02,569
Not just junk food.

2648
02:20:02,569 --> 02:20:03,370
I have to-

2649
02:20:03,370 --> 02:20:05,290
I forget spam cannot move that fast.

2650
02:20:05,290 --> 02:20:13,340
So have a coconut.

2651
02:20:13,340 --> 02:20:14,379
Wrong dog?

2652
02:20:14,379 --> 02:20:16,739
What do you mean?

2653
02:20:16,739 --> 02:20:18,309
Spud's fine.

2654
02:20:18,309 --> 02:20:25,420
Spud's not hungry.

2655
02:20:25,420 --> 02:20:26,540
Everybody's eating.

2656
02:20:26,540 --> 02:20:28,489
All right.

2657
02:20:28,489 --> 02:20:29,610
Come on out, Mud.

2658
02:20:29,610 --> 02:20:31,860
Let's give Mud a-

2659
02:20:31,860 --> 02:20:45,129
Like a guava or whatever this is.

2660
02:20:45,129 --> 02:20:49,670
Old man.

2661
02:20:49,670 --> 02:20:56,219
Guava puree.

2662
02:20:56,219 --> 02:20:56,459
All right.

2663
02:20:56,459 --> 02:20:57,739
You're kind of just stuck over here.

2664
02:20:57,739 --> 02:21:02,860
Get over here.

2665
02:21:02,860 --> 02:21:08,329
Go play with the other dogs.

2666
02:21:08,329 --> 02:21:16,680
Rude.

2667
02:21:16,680 --> 02:21:17,479
Oh good.

2668
02:21:17,479 --> 02:21:18,120
Squary.

2669
02:21:18,120 --> 02:21:23,340
Delicious.

2670
02:21:23,340 --> 02:21:29,159
And eat a coconut too.

2671
02:21:29,159 --> 02:21:30,280
Oh be careful, Mud.

2672
02:21:31,239 --> 02:21:33,559
You're so close to being like dead.

2673
02:21:33,559 --> 02:21:34,120
That's not-

2674
02:21:34,120 --> 02:21:34,920
That's so scary.

2675
02:21:34,920 --> 02:21:36,389
I don't like when you do that.

2676
02:21:36,389 --> 02:21:38,139
What do you want?

2677
02:21:38,139 --> 02:21:38,940
You want something?

2678
02:21:38,940 --> 02:21:42,100
Why don't you two like play?

2679
02:21:42,100 --> 02:21:49,049
Oh no.

2680
02:21:49,049 --> 02:22:12,250
This is like-

2681
02:22:12,250 --> 02:22:13,370
Actually like it hurts.

2682
02:22:13,370 --> 02:22:15,100
Oh no.

2683
02:22:15,100 --> 02:22:15,899
Why do they have to do that?

2684
02:22:15,899 --> 02:22:16,940
Put his head back on.

2685
02:22:16,940 --> 02:22:27,540
Why does his head have to pop off?

2686
02:22:27,540 --> 02:22:27,860
Okay.

2687
02:22:27,860 --> 02:22:29,540
Now I don't want anyone to eat Mud.

2688
02:22:29,540 --> 02:22:30,889
I don't want that.

2689
02:22:30,889 --> 02:22:33,989
I want Mud's life orb.

2690
02:22:33,989 --> 02:22:35,000
What do I do?

2691
02:22:40,870 --> 02:22:42,329
Just destroy?

2692
02:22:42,329 --> 02:22:44,760
Or should somebody eat him?

2693
02:22:44,760 --> 02:22:50,809
How do I get the orb?

2694
02:22:50,809 --> 02:22:51,850
Squary, get away.

2695
02:22:51,850 --> 02:22:56,979
Somebody has to eat it?

2696
02:22:56,979 --> 02:22:58,020
You have to eat it.

2697
02:22:58,020 --> 02:23:05,219
Squary.

2698
02:23:06,950 --> 02:23:11,219
No, let's have you come up here and eat.

2699
02:23:11,219 --> 02:23:11,620
You-

2700
02:23:11,620 --> 02:23:12,739
Can I pick you up?

2701
02:23:12,739 --> 02:23:14,739
This talk is fucking stupid.

2702
02:23:16,409 --> 02:23:17,930
I think Squary will eat-

2703
02:23:17,930 --> 02:23:20,090
You are all such morons.

2704
02:23:20,090 --> 02:23:20,329
Okay.

2705
02:23:20,329 --> 02:23:24,790
Well, Squary's gonna-

2706
02:23:24,790 --> 02:24:02,180
They were friends, weren't they?

2707
02:24:02,180 --> 02:24:02,659
You just-

2708
02:24:03,479 --> 02:24:06,149
Shit on his-

2709
02:24:06,149 --> 02:24:06,389
All right.

2710
02:24:06,389 --> 02:24:07,110
I want to get-

2711
02:24:07,110 --> 02:24:08,069
I don't like this.

2712
02:24:08,069 --> 02:24:11,479
I want to get rid of this.

2713
02:24:11,479 --> 02:24:11,879
Okay.

2714
02:24:11,879 --> 02:24:12,920
I don't want any-

2715
02:24:13,879 --> 02:24:14,760
I'm just gonna move-

2716
02:24:15,319 --> 02:24:16,280
Get rid of it.

2717
02:24:16,280 --> 02:24:20,100
Right?

2718
02:24:20,100 --> 02:24:21,139
If I destroy-

2719
02:24:21,139 --> 02:24:21,860
Stop!

2720
02:24:21,860 --> 02:24:23,540
Please.

2721
02:24:23,540 --> 02:24:24,819
Somebody has to eat it?

2722
02:24:28,120 --> 02:24:29,959
Bring this weird one up here.

2723
02:24:29,959 --> 02:24:33,399
Where are you?

2724
02:24:33,399 --> 02:24:35,799
Get off of that.

2725
02:24:35,799 --> 02:24:42,579
God.

2726
02:24:42,579 --> 02:24:42,979
All right.

2727
02:24:42,979 --> 02:24:44,659
Just eat this, please.

2728
02:24:44,659 --> 02:24:49,420
I hate this.

2729
02:24:49,420 --> 02:24:50,620
I don't want to eat this.

2730
02:24:50,620 --> 02:25:06,629
Spam, get up there and eat it.

2731
02:25:06,629 --> 02:25:07,030
Stop!

2732
02:25:10,219 --> 02:25:19,420
Okay.

2733
02:25:19,420 --> 02:25:20,780
Don't touch this.

2734
02:25:20,780 --> 02:25:26,059
Okay.

2735
02:25:26,059 --> 02:25:29,270
Memorialize.

2736
02:25:29,270 --> 02:25:30,940
There we go.

2737
02:25:30,940 --> 02:25:35,799
Mud, a good dog.

2738
02:25:35,799 --> 02:25:36,520
Oh.

2739
02:25:36,520 --> 02:25:48,200
He was everyone's friend.

2740
02:25:48,200 --> 02:25:52,979
Okay.

2741
02:25:52,979 --> 02:25:53,540
I want to get-

2742
02:25:53,540 --> 02:25:54,100
I don't-

2743
02:25:54,100 --> 02:25:55,299
I want to get rid of this stuff.

2744
02:25:55,299 --> 02:25:56,899
I don't want people eating this shit.

2745
02:25:56,899 --> 02:26:01,559
Are you okay?

2746
02:26:01,559 --> 02:26:02,280
What's wrong?

2747
02:26:02,280 --> 02:26:04,309
You all right?

2748
02:26:04,309 --> 02:26:15,860
All right.

2749
02:26:15,860 --> 02:26:16,819
Who is this?

2750
02:26:16,819 --> 02:26:22,620
Oh, this was raw.

2751
02:26:22,620 --> 02:26:27,750
Body color going orange here.

2752
02:26:27,750 --> 02:26:29,430
Back top leg length.

2753
02:26:29,430 --> 02:26:43,350
It's actually gonna be hard to walk around, I think.

2754
02:26:43,350 --> 02:26:50,889
Green bamboo wall.

2755
02:26:50,889 --> 02:26:51,370
Cool.

2756
02:26:51,370 --> 02:26:53,700
All right.

2757
02:26:53,700 --> 02:26:54,579
I got eggs now.

2758
02:26:54,579 --> 02:26:54,979
Who else?

2759
02:26:54,979 --> 02:26:55,459
You're up there.

2760
02:26:55,459 --> 02:26:56,340
Spud's up there.

2761
02:26:56,340 --> 02:27:01,190
I think I can incubate the other one, right?

2762
02:27:01,190 --> 02:27:02,860
Yes, I can.

2763
02:27:02,860 --> 02:27:09,559
All right.

2764
02:27:09,559 --> 02:27:10,760
Spud, what'd you get?

2765
02:27:10,760 --> 02:27:13,620
Not a whole lot.

2766
02:27:20,149 --> 02:27:20,950
Eat the cocoon.

2767
02:27:20,950 --> 02:27:26,200
Anybody hungry?

2768
02:27:26,200 --> 02:27:29,139
Turbo can mutate.

2769
02:27:29,139 --> 02:27:29,639
All right.

2770
02:27:30,500 --> 02:27:31,139
Loves to eat.

2771
02:27:31,780 --> 02:27:32,979
Oh, let's just get you going.

2772
02:27:32,979 --> 02:27:37,739
Spud didn't really eat that much.

2773
02:27:37,739 --> 02:27:43,479
Spud's never hungry.

2774
02:27:43,479 --> 02:27:48,700
Honestly, I don't think Spud really eats that much.

2775
02:27:48,700 --> 02:27:57,979
Cocoon?

2776
02:27:57,979 --> 02:27:58,620
Yeah, I am.

2777
02:27:58,620 --> 02:28:00,059
All right.

2778
02:28:00,059 --> 02:28:01,579
I thought that was a french fry on the ground.

2779
02:28:01,579 --> 02:28:09,940
Okay.

2780
02:28:09,940 --> 02:28:15,770
Herbert is getting a little bigger.

2781
02:28:15,770 --> 02:28:19,739
Getting a little glossier.

2782
02:28:19,739 --> 02:28:23,940
Okay.

2783
02:28:23,940 --> 02:28:24,659
Memorial-

2784
02:28:24,659 --> 02:28:25,940
Spooky food dispenser.

2785
02:28:25,940 --> 02:28:27,379
Ooh, we got new food.

2786
02:28:27,379 --> 02:28:28,389
All right.

2787
02:28:28,389 --> 02:28:28,709
What is it?

2788
02:28:28,709 --> 02:28:29,510
Let's check it out.

2789
02:28:29,510 --> 02:28:30,520
All right.

2790
02:28:30,520 --> 02:28:30,840
I need to-

2791
02:28:32,329 --> 02:28:33,620
Let me clean this up.

2792
02:28:33,620 --> 02:28:33,860
Right.

2793
02:28:33,860 --> 02:28:34,500
Like, I don't want to-

2794
02:28:34,500 --> 02:28:35,459
This is more-

2795
02:28:35,459 --> 02:28:36,020
I don't like this.

2796
02:28:36,020 --> 02:28:43,770
This is morbid.

2797
02:28:43,770 --> 02:28:44,010
Okay.

2798
02:28:44,010 --> 02:28:45,209
A new food dispenser.

2799
02:28:45,209 --> 02:28:52,819
Spooky food dispenser.

2800
02:28:52,819 --> 02:28:54,899
I could probably change some decorations up, too.

2801
02:29:05,780 --> 02:29:06,500
Let me move the-

2802
02:29:06,500 --> 02:29:07,139
I don't-

2803
02:29:07,139 --> 02:29:08,870
There's already one of these down there.

2804
02:29:08,870 --> 02:29:09,750
Let's get rid of it.

2805
02:29:09,750 --> 02:29:14,620
I'm very curious about this, though.

2806
02:29:14,620 --> 02:29:15,540
All right.

2807
02:29:15,540 --> 02:29:16,899
So what can I do with this?

2808
02:29:16,899 --> 02:29:17,219
Let me-

2809
02:29:17,219 --> 02:29:18,100
Let's do-

2810
02:29:18,100 --> 02:29:19,139
Let me redecorate it.

2811
02:29:23,479 --> 02:29:24,360
I like this better.

2812
02:29:24,360 --> 02:29:29,239
I like the hot dogs.

2813
02:29:29,239 --> 02:29:32,860
Oh, down in the playroom.

2814
02:29:32,860 --> 02:29:40,010
This thing's kind of annoying.

2815
02:29:44,780 --> 02:29:51,510
This is a fun little thing.

2816
02:29:51,510 --> 02:29:56,149
The car is-

2817
02:29:56,149 --> 02:29:56,549
I kind of-

2818
02:29:56,549 --> 02:29:58,389
I don't know if I like this, but whatever.

2819
02:29:58,389 --> 02:29:59,340
It's variety.

2820
02:29:59,340 --> 02:30:05,260
It's variety.

2821
02:30:05,260 --> 02:30:11,850
Oh, I won't put the fan over here.

2822
02:30:11,850 --> 02:30:17,899
Pull people off.

2823
02:30:17,899 --> 02:30:18,459
How about, like-

2824
02:30:19,180 --> 02:30:21,959
You listen to music, listen to tunes,

2825
02:30:21,959 --> 02:30:23,299
and cool off a little.

2826
02:30:23,299 --> 02:30:27,219
And then maybe, like, a fun little speaker over here or something?

2827
02:30:27,219 --> 02:30:37,260
Yeah, it's like a nice cooling fan.

2828
02:30:37,260 --> 02:30:37,899
Oh.

2829
02:30:37,899 --> 02:30:42,340
All right.

2830
02:30:42,340 --> 02:30:43,459
There is-

2831
02:30:43,459 --> 02:30:47,159
But, um-

2832
02:30:47,159 --> 02:30:49,479
Bubblegum.

2833
02:30:49,479 --> 02:30:54,280
Gumby.

2834
02:30:54,280 --> 02:30:59,159
I don't know, like, Smush.

2835
02:30:59,159 --> 02:31:03,879
Idian Ofnir.

2836
02:31:03,879 --> 02:31:08,360
I like Smush.

2837
02:31:08,360 --> 02:31:11,020
Welcome to the world, Smush.

2838
02:31:11,020 --> 02:31:15,940
How come all the dogs are lazy?

2839
02:31:19,829 --> 02:31:20,149
All right.

2840
02:31:20,149 --> 02:31:21,430
Raw needs some food.

2841
02:31:21,430 --> 02:31:22,809
28 minutes old.

2842
02:31:22,809 --> 02:31:23,690
That's funny.

2843
02:31:23,690 --> 02:31:25,590
All right.

2844
02:31:25,590 --> 02:31:27,350
Go up and eat one of the weird things.

2845
02:31:27,350 --> 02:31:27,989
Where's Raw?

2846
02:31:27,989 --> 02:31:28,309
Where are you?

2847
02:31:28,309 --> 02:31:28,790
There you are.

2848
02:31:28,790 --> 02:31:40,229
Let me see you.

2849
02:31:40,229 --> 02:31:41,430
A gourd?

2850
02:31:41,430 --> 02:31:42,250
Okay.

2851
02:31:42,250 --> 02:31:43,370
Eat a gourd.

2852
02:31:43,370 --> 02:31:45,479
Try this.

2853
02:31:45,479 --> 02:31:47,700
What do you think?

2854
02:31:47,700 --> 02:31:52,389
What does that do?

2855
02:31:52,389 --> 02:31:59,030
Is that new DNA?

2856
02:31:59,030 --> 02:32:02,389
That's very filling, too.

2857
02:32:02,389 --> 02:32:02,629
All right.

2858
02:32:02,629 --> 02:32:03,670
What about, um-

2859
02:32:03,670 --> 02:32:05,590
What about some decorative corn?

2860
02:32:05,590 --> 02:32:13,909
Try that.

2861
02:32:13,909 --> 02:32:14,790
Loud sleeper.

2862
02:32:14,790 --> 02:32:15,510
Geez.

2863
02:32:15,510 --> 02:32:27,530
Raise a dog that lives long enough to become ancient.

2864
02:32:27,530 --> 02:32:28,969
Burnt dog biscuit?

2865
02:32:28,969 --> 02:32:29,370
Wait.

2866
02:32:29,370 --> 02:32:30,649
Who's ancient?

2867
02:32:30,649 --> 02:32:32,899
Oh, Squary.

2868
02:32:35,180 --> 02:32:36,780
Squary is ancient.

2869
02:32:36,780 --> 02:32:48,059
I'll turn that off.

2870
02:32:48,059 --> 02:32:53,819
I fucking hate that.

2871
02:32:53,819 --> 02:32:57,860
Short body and yellow coloration from eating a gourd.

2872
02:32:57,860 --> 02:33:01,979
Do I have any more eggs?

2873
02:33:01,979 --> 02:33:02,299
All right.

2874
02:33:02,299 --> 02:33:02,940
I have-

2875
02:33:02,940 --> 02:33:04,860
Let me see.

2876
02:33:04,860 --> 02:33:05,420
Can I breed?

2877
02:33:08,069 --> 02:33:08,469
I can.

2878
02:33:08,469 --> 02:33:09,270
All right.

2879
02:33:09,270 --> 02:33:10,069
Um-

2880
02:33:10,149 --> 02:33:11,270
Nobody else is old enough yet.

2881
02:33:11,829 --> 02:33:22,309
Okay.

2882
02:33:22,309 --> 02:33:22,950
Spam.

2883
02:33:22,950 --> 02:33:25,030
I want you to eat a candy apple.

2884
02:33:25,590 --> 02:33:30,420
Try that.

2885
02:33:30,420 --> 02:33:31,059
You all right?

2886
02:33:31,059 --> 02:33:31,940
You okay?

2887
02:33:31,940 --> 02:33:32,819
I'm sorry.

2888
02:33:32,819 --> 02:33:34,100
I did not mean to do that.

2889
02:33:34,100 --> 02:33:34,659
Don't bite me.

2890
02:33:43,899 --> 02:33:46,219
Eat the candy apple and the decorative corn.

2891
02:33:46,219 --> 02:33:48,219
Look at that.

2892
02:33:48,219 --> 02:33:48,780
New DNA.

2893
02:33:51,129 --> 02:33:52,250
New DNA.

2894
02:33:52,250 --> 02:33:56,200
Okay.

2895
02:33:56,200 --> 02:33:57,159
I don't think you liked it.

2896
02:33:57,159 --> 02:33:58,120
But you got some DNA.

2897
02:33:58,120 --> 02:33:58,760
What about the corn?

2898
02:33:58,760 --> 02:33:59,719
Do you like decorative corn?

2899
02:34:00,280 --> 02:34:11,979
Try the decorative corn.

2900
02:34:14,709 --> 02:34:15,350
No?

2901
02:34:15,350 --> 02:34:17,940
No?

2902
02:34:17,940 --> 02:34:22,709
Are you okay?

2903
02:34:22,709 --> 02:34:25,719
Kind of.

2904
02:34:25,719 --> 02:34:26,920
Didn't really like that.

2905
02:34:26,920 --> 02:34:33,000
What is this one?

2906
02:34:34,729 --> 02:34:35,290
Uh-

2907
02:34:35,290 --> 02:34:35,530
I just-

2908
02:34:35,530 --> 02:34:36,569
This one here.

2909
02:34:36,569 --> 02:34:40,020
I don't know what the effects are.

2910
02:34:40,819 --> 02:34:42,280
Still don't know the-

2911
02:34:42,280 --> 02:34:43,319
Oh, brown coloration.

2912
02:34:43,319 --> 02:34:44,280
Okay.

2913
02:34:44,280 --> 02:34:49,180
Can I make a centipede?

2914
02:34:53,420 --> 02:34:54,139
Um, okay.

2915
02:34:54,139 --> 02:34:54,620
Who else should-

2916
02:34:54,620 --> 02:34:55,420
Who needs to eat?

2917
02:34:55,979 --> 02:34:56,700
Spud's hungry.

2918
02:34:56,700 --> 02:34:57,020
Oh no!

2919
02:34:57,020 --> 02:34:57,739
What's wrong with Spud?

2920
02:34:57,739 --> 02:34:58,700
His nose is glowing.

2921
02:34:58,700 --> 02:35:01,049
I'll bring him a candy apple.

2922
02:35:01,049 --> 02:35:19,129
All right.

2923
02:35:19,129 --> 02:35:19,850
Hey, Spud.

2924
02:35:19,850 --> 02:35:22,680
Try this.

2925
02:35:22,680 --> 02:35:28,360
Is it hot in here?

2926
02:35:28,360 --> 02:35:31,129
What's wrong with Smush?

2927
02:35:31,129 --> 02:35:32,409
What is-

2928
02:35:32,409 --> 02:35:33,049
Are you okay?

2929
02:35:33,049 --> 02:35:33,610
Oh my god.

2930
02:35:33,610 --> 02:35:34,569
What's wrong with Smush?

2931
02:35:38,389 --> 02:35:38,950
You all right?

2932
02:35:39,940 --> 02:35:45,780
Why are you just in the corner?

2933
02:35:45,780 --> 02:35:47,930
Um-

2934
02:35:47,930 --> 02:35:48,430
Me!

2935
02:35:49,879 --> 02:35:50,120
All right.

2936
02:35:50,120 --> 02:35:50,920
You're fine.

2937
02:35:50,920 --> 02:35:54,409
Need to feed you something though.

2938
02:35:54,409 --> 02:36:04,520
Tech floor.

2939
02:36:06,649 --> 02:36:07,530
Is it really hot in here?

2940
02:36:07,530 --> 02:36:08,729
I'm gonna have a fan going.

2941
02:36:08,729 --> 02:36:17,350
How many people need to sleep?

2942
02:36:17,350 --> 02:36:21,860
All right.

2943
02:36:21,860 --> 02:36:22,739
I need some more food.

2944
02:36:22,739 --> 02:36:27,139
Let's get some gourds.

2945
02:36:27,139 --> 02:36:28,020
Uh-

2946
02:36:28,020 --> 02:36:30,090
Some like chicken and nutri-

2947
02:36:30,090 --> 02:36:31,290
Yeah, sliders.

2948
02:36:31,290 --> 02:36:33,829
Stop.

2949
02:36:33,829 --> 02:36:34,549
Stop it.

2950
02:36:34,549 --> 02:36:35,860
What's going on over here?

2951
02:36:35,860 --> 02:36:37,049
Stop.

2952
02:36:37,049 --> 02:36:37,690
Hey.

2953
02:36:37,690 --> 02:36:41,319
Who's causing a problem?

2954
02:36:41,319 --> 02:36:43,079
Which one?

2955
02:36:43,079 --> 02:36:44,229
Hey.

2956
02:36:44,229 --> 02:36:45,670
That was not very nice.

2957
02:36:45,670 --> 02:36:49,110
That wasn't very nice.

2958
02:36:49,110 --> 02:36:50,229
Get off of him.

2959
02:36:50,229 --> 02:36:51,659
Get off of him.

2960
02:36:51,659 --> 02:36:54,780
That's not nice what you're doing.

2961
02:36:54,780 --> 02:36:55,739
Are you okay?

2962
02:36:55,739 --> 02:36:56,760
Raw.

2963
02:36:56,760 --> 02:37:00,680
That wasn't very nice.

2964
02:37:00,680 --> 02:37:04,420
You hungry?

2965
02:37:04,420 --> 02:37:05,379
Let him up.

2966
02:37:05,379 --> 02:37:07,610
Let him up.

2967
02:37:07,610 --> 02:37:11,420
Let him up.

2968
02:37:11,420 --> 02:37:11,899
Stop!

2969
02:37:11,899 --> 02:37:13,500
Why do you have it out for him so bad?

2970
02:37:13,500 --> 02:37:15,930
Let him up.

2971
02:37:15,930 --> 02:37:18,219
Why?

2972
02:37:18,219 --> 02:37:18,940
Stop it.

2973
02:37:18,940 --> 02:37:20,219
Let him up.

2974
02:37:20,219 --> 02:37:21,500
Don't do that.

2975
02:37:21,500 --> 02:37:30,440
Come over here.

2976
02:37:30,440 --> 02:37:31,239
Stop!

2977
02:37:31,239 --> 02:37:31,639
Hey!

2978
02:37:33,420 --> 02:37:35,500
You sit down right now.

2979
02:37:35,500 --> 02:37:36,459
Sit down over here.

2980
02:37:37,319 --> 02:37:38,040
Excuse me.

2981
02:37:38,040 --> 02:37:39,510
No.

2982
02:37:39,510 --> 02:37:40,790
Sit down.

2983
02:37:40,790 --> 02:37:41,829
Leave Raw alone.

2984
02:37:41,829 --> 02:37:42,950
What did Raw do for-

2985
02:37:42,950 --> 02:37:43,110
What-

2986
02:37:43,110 --> 02:37:43,750
For no reason.

2987
02:37:45,260 --> 02:37:46,620
Don't bite him for no reason.

2988
02:37:48,379 --> 02:37:49,100
He's still-

2989
02:37:49,100 --> 02:37:49,500
All right.

2990
02:37:49,500 --> 02:37:50,459
Raw.

2991
02:37:50,459 --> 02:37:51,260
Raw, come here.

2992
02:37:52,659 --> 02:37:53,780
Raw, we're gonna put you over here.

2993
02:37:53,780 --> 02:37:54,420
You're gonna-

2994
02:37:54,420 --> 02:37:54,579
Here.

2995
02:37:54,579 --> 02:37:55,219
Here's a gourd.

2996
02:37:57,750 --> 02:37:58,469
Here.

2997
02:37:58,469 --> 02:38:00,090
Try that.

2998
02:38:01,399 --> 02:38:02,040
No, don't leave.

2999
02:38:02,040 --> 02:38:02,200
Don't-

3000
02:38:02,200 --> 02:38:06,520
No, you idiot.

3001
02:38:06,520 --> 02:38:08,760
You can't just, like, dominate this space.

3002
02:38:08,760 --> 02:38:09,479
The problem is...

3003
02:38:11,319 --> 02:38:15,430
Spam is territorially claiming the food room.

3004
02:38:15,430 --> 02:38:16,950
Maybe I shouldn't have a food room.

3005
02:38:16,950 --> 02:38:20,040
It seems like it's causing problems.

3006
02:38:20,040 --> 02:38:24,180
Because he's claiming this is territory.

3007
02:38:24,180 --> 02:38:43,399
Are you ho-

3008
02:38:43,399 --> 02:38:44,120
Come over here.

3009
02:38:44,120 --> 02:38:45,159
Go in front of the fan.

3010
02:38:46,739 --> 02:38:47,620
Right here.

3011
02:38:47,620 --> 02:38:53,670
Can you not stay there?

3012
02:38:53,670 --> 02:38:53,909
All right.

3013
02:38:53,909 --> 02:38:54,790
I'm just gonna hold you here.

3014
02:38:54,790 --> 02:38:55,909
Because you're, like, sweating.

3015
02:38:56,469 --> 02:39:01,559
Okay.

3016
02:39:01,559 --> 02:39:02,280
He's sweating.

3017
02:39:03,719 --> 02:39:04,120
All right.

3018
02:39:04,120 --> 02:39:06,170
Here comes the mean one.

3019
02:39:06,170 --> 02:39:06,729
Are you done?

3020
02:39:09,639 --> 02:39:11,159
Go sleep in the playroom.

3021
02:39:11,159 --> 02:39:13,190
Go sleep in the playroom.

3022
02:39:15,930 --> 02:39:16,329
Come here.

3023
02:39:16,889 --> 02:39:19,940
Eat a banana.

3024
02:39:19,940 --> 02:39:22,100
And then go to sleep in the playroom.

3025
02:39:22,100 --> 02:39:28,459
Okay.

3026
02:39:28,459 --> 02:39:33,059
Now go over here and go to bed.

3027
02:39:33,059 --> 02:39:33,860
You're being bad.

3028
02:39:33,860 --> 02:39:37,770
Now go sleep over there.

3029
02:39:37,770 --> 02:39:38,969
And leave everybody alone.

3030
02:39:38,969 --> 02:39:49,799
We got a ton of mutations coming.

3031
02:39:49,799 --> 02:39:53,670
Just smush.

3032
02:39:53,670 --> 02:39:55,850
Got a green nose now.

3033
02:39:55,850 --> 02:39:58,709
Aw, that's so cute.

3034
02:39:58,709 --> 02:40:00,309
Back leg stance width.

3035
02:40:00,309 --> 02:40:01,579
More of a-

3036
02:40:01,579 --> 02:40:03,610
A little width there.

3037
02:40:03,610 --> 02:40:07,299
Very shiny.

3038
02:40:07,299 --> 02:40:10,059
Very nice.

3039
02:40:10,059 --> 02:40:10,860
What about you?

3040
02:40:10,860 --> 02:40:22,040
Turns-

3041
02:40:22,040 --> 02:40:22,920
It's all-

3042
02:40:22,920 --> 02:40:23,959
It's all yellow.

3043
02:40:23,959 --> 02:40:30,280
Interesting.

3044
02:40:30,280 --> 02:40:30,680
All right.

3045
02:40:30,680 --> 02:40:31,799
Got even longer.

3046
02:40:31,799 --> 02:40:34,860
This is like a banana now.

3047
02:40:34,860 --> 02:40:40,540
What's going on in here?

3048
02:40:40,540 --> 02:40:41,659
Why are they all fighting?

3049
02:40:41,659 --> 02:40:42,620
Stop fighting.

3050
02:40:42,620 --> 02:40:46,459
Smush.

3051
02:40:46,459 --> 02:40:47,100
Stop it.

3052
02:40:47,100 --> 02:40:50,100
Everybody relax.

3053
02:40:50,100 --> 02:40:50,659
Relax.

3054
02:40:50,659 --> 02:40:52,260
You're both very good dogs.

3055
02:40:52,260 --> 02:40:58,899
All right.

3056
02:40:58,899 --> 02:40:59,379
You're back.

3057
02:40:59,379 --> 02:40:59,780
You're-

3058
02:40:59,780 --> 02:41:00,579
You're okay.

3059
02:41:00,579 --> 02:41:13,000
I wonder, can I breed now?

3060
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:13,479
You don't.

3061
02:41:14,459 --> 02:41:14,860
This-

3062
02:41:14,860 --> 02:41:16,069
All right.

3063
02:41:16,069 --> 02:41:17,430
Raw is kind of scary.

3064
02:41:17,430 --> 02:41:26,340
He's having a good time.

3065
02:41:26,340 --> 02:41:27,059
So whatever.

3066
02:41:27,059 --> 02:41:34,629
He's rolling around and pee.

3067
02:41:34,629 --> 02:41:45,430
Sherbert hasn't really changed that much.

3068
02:41:45,430 --> 02:41:47,909
We can breed though.

3069
02:41:47,909 --> 02:41:52,149
A little more gloss.

3070
02:41:52,149 --> 02:41:53,450
A little bit bigger.

3071
02:41:53,450 --> 02:41:57,459
Back bottom leg length.

3072
02:41:57,459 --> 02:41:58,659
That's actually going to be concerning.

3073
02:41:59,940 --> 02:42:00,500
The legs-

3074
02:42:00,500 --> 02:42:01,780
His back legs are too long.

3075
02:42:01,780 --> 02:42:06,360
All right.

3076
02:42:06,360 --> 02:42:07,479
I think it's time to breed.

3077
02:42:07,479 --> 02:42:10,100
We have a few adults here.

3078
02:42:10,100 --> 02:42:10,659
Yellow.

3079
02:42:10,659 --> 02:42:11,379
Here.

3080
02:42:11,379 --> 02:42:16,809
Okay.

3081
02:42:16,809 --> 02:42:20,090
Spud.

3082
02:42:20,090 --> 02:42:21,770
Front bottom leg length.

3083
02:42:21,770 --> 02:42:24,700
Interesting.

3084
02:42:24,700 --> 02:42:27,450
40 percent.

3085
02:42:27,450 --> 02:42:30,040
Smaller ears.

3086
02:42:30,040 --> 02:42:31,319
Body metallic.

3087
02:42:31,319 --> 02:42:39,850
His front legs are too long.

3088
02:42:39,850 --> 02:42:41,450
Eat 10 clumps of dirt.

3089
02:42:41,450 --> 02:42:44,729
Mud floor.

3090
02:42:44,729 --> 02:42:45,129
All right.

3091
02:42:45,129 --> 02:42:45,610
It's time.

3092
02:42:46,729 --> 02:42:49,459
I got an egg here.

3093
02:42:49,459 --> 02:42:50,579
We're going to do raw.

3094
02:42:52,059 --> 02:42:52,540
And I don't know.

3095
02:42:52,540 --> 02:42:52,940
Who else?

3096
02:42:54,700 --> 02:42:57,850
Spam.

3097
02:42:57,850 --> 02:43:02,280
Raw or maybe raw and Sherbert.

3098
02:43:02,280 --> 02:43:03,399
But raw and spud.

3099
02:43:03,399 --> 02:43:05,430
Squire.

3100
02:43:05,430 --> 02:43:08,139
Spud's not old enough.

3101
02:43:08,139 --> 02:43:09,500
We get something interesting here.

3102
02:43:09,500 --> 02:43:17,159
Or these two.

3103
02:43:17,159 --> 02:43:17,719
Go.

3104
02:43:17,719 --> 02:43:23,399
All right.

3105
02:43:23,399 --> 02:43:25,479
Somehow this one has an even smaller head.

3106
02:43:25,479 --> 02:43:29,000
Look at this one.

3107
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,290
The legs are so long.

3108
02:43:37,930 --> 02:43:39,379
And probably the-

3109
02:43:39,379 --> 02:43:40,500
This one just like the-

3110
02:43:40,500 --> 02:43:41,059
This one here.

3111
02:43:52,280 --> 02:43:53,319
Even longer.

3112
02:43:53,319 --> 02:43:58,100
Remember, this is unethical.

3113
02:44:10,379 --> 02:44:10,780
Whoa!

3114
02:44:13,530 --> 02:44:15,450
Oh, I think this is it, right?

3115
02:44:15,450 --> 02:44:17,370
Should I keep going or should I breed this one?

3116
02:44:17,930 --> 02:44:18,809
Look at that.

3117
02:44:18,809 --> 02:44:21,899
That's like a Giga Chad.

3118
02:44:26,170 --> 02:44:27,370
I think I keep this one.

3119
02:44:27,370 --> 02:44:32,899
I'm going to keep this one.

3120
02:44:32,899 --> 02:44:35,620
One, two, three, four, five, six legs.

3121
02:44:35,620 --> 02:44:36,579
This one can actually walk.

3122
02:44:45,909 --> 02:44:46,469
Name this one.

3123
02:44:46,469 --> 02:44:48,700
Imposter.

3124
02:44:48,700 --> 02:44:50,489
Aw.

3125
02:44:50,489 --> 02:44:51,850
Smush loves the playroom.

3126
02:44:53,620 --> 02:44:54,340
He's having trouble.

3127
02:44:54,340 --> 02:44:55,540
He's like, I don't know what to do with this ball.

3128
02:44:56,100 --> 02:44:58,440
Why can't I pick the ball up with my mouth?

3129
02:44:58,440 --> 02:44:58,920
It's not fair.

3130
02:45:00,299 --> 02:45:01,020
It's too heavy.

3131
02:45:02,389 --> 02:45:02,889
What?

3132
02:45:08,659 --> 02:45:09,459
Who just did that?

3133
02:45:15,450 --> 02:45:16,409
Oh, Smush.

3134
02:45:16,409 --> 02:45:17,610
You're having such a good time.

3135
02:45:19,219 --> 02:45:20,739
Oh, Smush is hoarding.

3136
02:45:22,579 --> 02:45:23,139
I get it.

3137
02:45:23,139 --> 02:45:23,940
Okay.

3138
02:45:23,940 --> 02:45:28,340
Smush, it might be my new favorite.

3139
02:45:28,340 --> 02:45:41,260
Spud has not left the top right corner

3140
02:45:41,260 --> 02:45:43,100
the whole time we've been playing the entire time.

3141
02:45:50,899 --> 02:45:52,340
Oh, got your own food.

3142
02:45:52,819 --> 02:45:56,059
All right.

3143
02:45:56,059 --> 02:45:56,860
It's a mess up here.

3144
02:45:57,420 --> 02:45:58,299
What are you doing?

3145
02:45:58,299 --> 02:45:59,659
I'm sure about how you're doing.

3146
02:45:59,659 --> 02:46:02,920
Just playing.

3147
02:46:02,920 --> 02:46:04,440
Oh, you're building.

3148
02:46:06,819 --> 02:46:07,620
Very smart.

3149
02:46:09,479 --> 02:46:10,600
Very smart.

3150
02:46:10,600 --> 02:46:12,120
Okay.

3151
02:46:12,840 --> 02:46:13,860
Very good.

3152
02:46:13,860 --> 02:46:14,340
Do that again.

3153
02:46:15,819 --> 02:46:17,020
Very, very good.

3154
02:46:17,020 --> 02:46:18,059
Very smart.

3155
02:46:18,059 --> 02:46:24,420
It's a mess up here.

3156
02:46:24,420 --> 02:46:35,450
I got a reward for throwing up.

3157
02:46:35,450 --> 02:46:37,690
Garlic bulb.

3158
02:46:37,690 --> 02:46:42,540
Want some garlic?

3159
02:46:42,540 --> 02:46:49,399
I'm going to feed the gar-

3160
02:46:49,399 --> 02:46:50,280
Smush.

3161
02:46:50,280 --> 02:46:53,799
Do you want some garlic, Smush?

3162
02:46:53,799 --> 02:46:54,280
Oh, no.

3163
02:46:54,280 --> 02:46:55,639
He's like sweating.

3164
02:46:57,209 --> 02:46:58,329
Stop doing that.

3165
02:46:58,329 --> 02:46:59,450
You guys are going to get hurt.

3166
02:46:59,450 --> 02:47:02,280
I think everyone's hungry.

3167
02:47:02,360 --> 02:47:06,020
Try some garlic.

3168
02:47:06,020 --> 02:47:06,979
It's good for you.

3169
02:47:06,979 --> 02:47:09,030
Well, no, it's not good for dogs,

3170
02:47:09,030 --> 02:47:11,110
but like in the sense of out of context.

3171
02:47:16,569 --> 02:47:17,850
Smush wants to eat that, yeah.

3172
02:47:20,579 --> 02:47:21,540
Yeah, do not-

3173
02:47:21,540 --> 02:47:22,420
Okay, what is it?

3174
02:47:24,440 --> 02:47:25,239
Shallots?

3175
02:47:25,239 --> 02:47:26,360
Like onions, garlic.

3176
02:47:27,860 --> 02:47:29,139
Anything that's like a shallot, right?

3177
02:47:29,780 --> 02:47:33,290
That was like cool, so I'm going to praise you.

3178
02:47:37,639 --> 02:47:41,079
Onions, garlic, grapes, chocolate.

3179
02:47:41,719 --> 02:47:44,100
There's actually a lot of things your dog really can't have.

3180
02:47:44,659 --> 02:47:48,309
What's wrong?

3181
02:47:48,309 --> 02:47:49,799
You all right?

3182
02:47:49,799 --> 02:47:52,870
Something healthy.

3183
02:47:53,850 --> 02:47:59,450
There, like eat like a nutrition pellet.

3184
02:48:00,709 --> 02:48:01,110
You okay?

3185
02:48:02,180 --> 02:48:07,479
Try that.

3186
02:48:07,479 --> 02:48:08,600
Yeah, eat something that's good for you.

3187
02:48:12,139 --> 02:48:15,299
You know, there's some garlic.

3188
02:48:20,500 --> 02:48:21,540
Dave, oh my god.

3189
02:48:22,180 --> 02:48:27,379
All right, new friend available, I think.

3190
02:48:35,319 --> 02:48:36,040
Tremendous.

3191
02:48:36,040 --> 02:48:37,000
That's actually a really good name.

3192
02:48:40,569 --> 02:48:41,530
Snacks.

3193
02:48:41,530 --> 02:48:42,010
Chowder.

3194
02:48:42,739 --> 02:48:43,620
Scout.

3195
02:48:43,620 --> 02:48:44,120
Damper.

3196
02:48:46,729 --> 02:48:47,229
Porn.

3197
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:49,879
Steak fry.

3198
02:48:51,579 --> 02:48:52,079
Tuba?

3199
02:48:52,620 --> 02:48:54,059
I like tuba.

3200
02:48:54,059 --> 02:48:59,479
Okay, tuba.

3201
02:48:59,479 --> 02:49:00,200
What are you going to eat?

3202
02:49:00,200 --> 02:49:01,319
How about some healthy stuff?

3203
02:49:01,799 --> 02:49:03,239
How about a coconut?

3204
02:49:03,239 --> 02:49:03,739
No, a...

3205
02:49:08,280 --> 02:49:09,079
I don't know.

3206
02:49:09,079 --> 02:49:10,659
What should we...

3207
02:49:10,659 --> 02:49:11,219
Come over here.

3208
02:49:11,219 --> 02:49:12,979
I want you over here.

3209
02:49:17,079 --> 02:49:17,719
Cityscape.

3210
02:49:17,719 --> 02:49:18,520
Ooh, let me try that.

3211
02:49:27,579 --> 02:49:29,500
Uh-oh, Spam is getting older.

3212
02:49:29,500 --> 02:49:33,750
Okay, Spam's getting old.

3213
02:49:33,750 --> 02:49:35,190
That's not bad.

3214
02:49:38,170 --> 02:49:38,729
Where's Spam?

3215
02:49:40,309 --> 02:49:40,870
What's Spud?

3216
02:49:40,870 --> 02:49:41,590
Spud's hungry.

3217
02:49:42,389 --> 02:49:45,670
I'm going to eat this.

3218
02:49:45,670 --> 02:49:47,829
I know, Spud has trouble like moving around, right?

3219
02:49:47,829 --> 02:49:52,979
Where's Spam?

3220
02:49:53,540 --> 02:49:55,959
All right, Spam's getting old.

3221
02:49:55,959 --> 02:49:56,920
We're going to have to breed Spam.

3222
02:49:57,479 --> 02:50:01,399
I need an egg.

3223
02:50:01,399 --> 02:50:04,250
Spam was mean.

3224
02:50:04,250 --> 02:50:07,270
This is penance.

3225
02:50:07,270 --> 02:50:09,770
Tuba is currently...

3226
02:50:13,770 --> 02:50:14,569
I think they're playing.

3227
02:50:20,649 --> 02:50:21,850
Tuba's just a puppy, though.

3228
02:50:26,299 --> 02:50:30,149
Um, Spud, are you...

3229
02:50:30,149 --> 02:50:32,520
Oh, an egg.

3230
02:50:32,520 --> 02:50:33,559
All right, stop, stop, stop.

3231
02:50:33,559 --> 02:50:34,360
That's enough, that's enough.

3232
02:50:34,360 --> 02:50:35,159
That's enough, that's enough.

3233
02:50:35,159 --> 02:50:36,600
Let go, let go, let go, let go.

3234
02:50:36,600 --> 02:50:37,100
Let go.

3235
02:50:43,340 --> 02:50:44,139
Oh, okay.

3236
02:50:44,139 --> 02:50:48,709
I was like, what happened?

3237
02:50:48,709 --> 02:50:50,069
All right, it's okay, Spud.

3238
02:50:50,069 --> 02:50:53,780
It's okay.

3239
02:50:53,780 --> 02:51:00,340
Go sleep next to your brother.

3240
02:51:00,340 --> 02:51:01,940
All right, ooh, sofa.

3241
02:51:01,940 --> 02:51:07,959
Can you not sleep here?

3242
02:51:07,959 --> 02:51:13,909
Take a nap.

3243
02:51:13,909 --> 02:51:17,260
Sleep.

3244
02:51:17,260 --> 02:51:17,760
Go to sleep.

3245
02:51:23,819 --> 02:51:25,260
What is going on over here?

3246
02:51:26,780 --> 02:51:27,979
Leave each other alone.

3247
02:51:28,540 --> 02:51:32,950
Stop it.

3248
02:51:32,950 --> 02:51:33,989
Who is that?

3249
02:51:33,989 --> 02:51:35,510
Smush, leave him.

3250
02:51:35,510 --> 02:51:41,290
Put him down.

3251
02:51:41,290 --> 02:51:42,440
Enough.

3252
02:51:42,440 --> 02:51:43,239
It's okay.

3253
02:51:43,239 --> 02:51:47,239
Smush, that's enough.

3254
02:51:47,239 --> 02:51:54,680
All right, sure.

3255
02:51:54,680 --> 02:51:55,639
We'll eat this.

3256
02:51:55,639 --> 02:52:00,420
Put him down?

3257
02:52:00,420 --> 02:52:01,540
Yeah, no, I mean, like, put him down.

3258
02:52:01,540 --> 02:52:02,100
Like, put him...

3259
02:52:02,100 --> 02:52:03,379
He's holding him.

3260
02:52:03,379 --> 02:52:06,809
How do you clean the dogs?

3261
02:52:06,809 --> 02:52:09,290
Is it filthy?

3262
02:52:09,290 --> 02:52:10,729
Is that why they keep on sweating?

3263
02:52:10,729 --> 02:52:18,010
Smush, you're kind of a psycho.

3264
02:52:18,010 --> 02:52:24,100
Here, have some of that.

3265
02:52:24,100 --> 02:52:31,850
All right, we need to do some breeding.

3266
02:52:31,850 --> 02:52:32,350
I got eggs.

3267
02:52:36,739 --> 02:52:42,489
All right, now we're going to do raw and Spam.

3268
02:52:42,489 --> 02:52:45,159
I think that makes some sense.

3269
02:52:45,159 --> 02:52:51,690
And we're going to go to, like, zero with this one.

3270
02:52:51,690 --> 02:52:56,180
Let me see what we can make here.

3271
02:52:56,180 --> 02:53:07,610
This one has a...

3272
02:53:07,610 --> 02:53:08,969
Look at this, how small this one's head is.

3273
02:53:12,389 --> 02:53:13,750
All right, that's interesting.

3274
02:53:13,750 --> 02:53:23,959
I'm moving around.

3275
02:53:23,959 --> 02:53:25,239
All right, getting weirder.

3276
02:53:25,239 --> 02:53:46,969
Still at 98% stability.

3277
02:53:46,969 --> 02:53:57,270
Huge, huge legs too, yeah.

3278
02:53:57,270 --> 02:54:00,379
Green.

3279
02:54:00,379 --> 02:54:01,340
All right, let's do this.

3280
02:54:02,139 --> 02:54:05,770
And I don't know, one of the big ones?

3281
02:54:05,770 --> 02:54:06,569
Probably, yeah.

3282
02:54:06,569 --> 02:54:15,000
Hell yeah, there we go.

3283
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:17,590
Interesting, I like that one.

3284
02:54:17,590 --> 02:54:26,010
And I like this one.

3285
02:54:26,010 --> 02:54:28,090
This one, this one's kind of just like...

3286
02:54:28,090 --> 02:54:40,870
This one's getting kind of walked over.

3287
02:54:40,870 --> 02:54:41,829
All right, how about this one?

3288
02:54:43,850 --> 02:54:50,600
And this one.

3289
02:54:50,600 --> 02:54:51,399
Whoa, okay.

3290
02:54:52,540 --> 02:54:54,620
They kind of look like a truck.

3291
02:54:54,620 --> 02:55:03,500
Getting something interesting, that's for sure.

3292
02:55:03,500 --> 02:55:08,090
How many legs do they have?

3293
02:55:08,090 --> 02:55:13,750
Looks like a garbage truck.

3294
02:55:25,579 --> 02:55:26,079
Whoa!

3295
02:55:27,510 --> 02:55:32,139
Okay, I'm going to keep going.

3296
02:55:32,139 --> 02:55:58,870
This is the one.

3297
02:55:58,870 --> 02:56:03,579
John Deere.

3298
02:56:03,579 --> 02:56:07,000
Okay, again, we're going to do...

3299
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:07,559
Should I wait?

3300
02:56:08,620 --> 02:56:14,629
What about Spam and Squary?

3301
02:56:14,629 --> 02:56:25,620
Let's see if we can get something cool here.

3302
02:56:25,620 --> 02:56:26,819
Kind of cool already.

3303
02:56:26,819 --> 02:56:33,100
One with a huge nose.

3304
02:56:35,049 --> 02:56:38,010
I want a dog with, like, a giant, like, nose.

3305
02:56:52,709 --> 02:56:55,770
Where's the biggest nose here?

3306
02:56:55,770 --> 02:57:02,649
Probably you.

3307
02:57:02,649 --> 02:57:05,030
You, it's getting a little longer.

3308
02:57:05,030 --> 02:57:09,770
I think you also have the big one.

3309
02:57:09,770 --> 02:57:19,659
Okay, I like the guy in the middle here.

3310
02:57:19,659 --> 02:57:30,340
And you, keep going, keep going.

3311
02:57:30,340 --> 02:57:38,100
Getting a lot paler.

3312
02:57:38,100 --> 02:57:47,639
Uh-oh.

3313
02:57:47,639 --> 02:57:51,239
Whoa, look at the tail!

3314
02:57:51,239 --> 02:57:53,479
That tail is huge.

3315
02:57:53,479 --> 02:58:03,030
Okay, hold on.

3316
02:58:03,030 --> 02:58:04,549
Oh, wow, that's awesome.

3317
02:58:04,549 --> 02:58:07,239
Okay, I think I stick with one here.

3318
02:58:07,239 --> 02:58:12,120
Or do I keep going?

3319
02:58:12,120 --> 02:58:16,790
Where's the longest tail?

3320
02:58:16,790 --> 02:58:27,780
I think this is the one.

3321
02:58:27,780 --> 02:58:35,270
I think it's this one here.

3322
02:58:35,270 --> 02:58:35,909
One more?

3323
02:58:35,909 --> 02:58:41,579
All right, one more.

3324
02:58:41,579 --> 02:58:49,780
We lost the color.

3325
02:58:49,780 --> 02:58:50,340
Shit.

3326
02:58:50,340 --> 02:58:51,799
All right, one more.

3327
02:58:58,500 --> 02:58:59,139
All right, we got one.

3328
02:58:59,139 --> 02:59:03,899
We got one.

3329
02:59:03,899 --> 02:59:04,379
That was it.

3330
02:59:04,379 --> 02:59:08,200
Did you see that move?

3331
02:59:08,200 --> 02:59:09,239
They're perfect.

3332
02:59:09,239 --> 02:59:35,799
These are, these are wildly different.

3333
02:59:36,760 --> 02:59:37,879
We're gonna have to do some incubation here.

3334
02:59:37,879 --> 02:59:39,510
Okay.

3335
02:59:39,510 --> 02:59:40,629
How are people doing?

3336
02:59:40,629 --> 02:59:41,510
People hungry?

3337
02:59:41,510 --> 02:59:43,219
Anybody dying?

3338
02:59:43,219 --> 02:59:48,979
Some food if you want it.

3339
02:59:48,979 --> 02:59:59,799
How are you guys doing?

3340
02:59:59,799 --> 03:00:00,600
Eat some food.

3341
03:00:00,600 --> 03:00:02,040
Everybody needs to get up there and eat.

3342
03:00:02,040 --> 03:00:07,370
You can't just, like, sit down here.

3343
03:00:07,370 --> 03:00:08,889
All right, so, Spike.

3344
03:00:08,889 --> 03:00:13,850
How about, um, people saying courage?

3345
03:00:13,850 --> 03:00:14,969
One, two, three, four, five.

3346
03:00:14,969 --> 03:00:16,090
How about courage?

3347
03:00:16,090 --> 03:00:23,940
How about courage with a six?

3348
03:00:23,940 --> 03:00:27,159
Because it's got six legs.

3349
03:00:27,159 --> 03:00:37,620
Three is not right.

3350
03:00:37,620 --> 03:00:38,579
No, fine.

3351
03:00:39,459 --> 03:00:42,139
What's this?

3352
03:00:42,139 --> 03:00:43,500
Hatch or mutate a dog with a tail?

3353
03:00:44,059 --> 03:00:53,139
Nobody's been burying anything.

3354
03:00:53,139 --> 03:00:58,420
Okay, I'm starting to get a lot of dogs now.

3355
03:00:58,420 --> 03:01:00,659
We have to start to keep track of this.

3356
03:01:00,659 --> 03:01:06,379
Where is everybody?

3357
03:01:09,799 --> 03:01:10,840
Okay, I'm starting to get,

3358
03:01:10,840 --> 03:01:12,360
I'm starting to get a lot of animals.

3359
03:01:12,360 --> 03:01:16,729
Tuba, how you doing?

3360
03:01:16,729 --> 03:01:17,930
You want a burrito?

3361
03:01:17,930 --> 03:01:18,409
Let me help you.

3362
03:01:18,409 --> 03:01:18,889
Come here.

3363
03:01:18,889 --> 03:01:23,479
It's right next to you, right there.

3364
03:01:23,479 --> 03:01:25,879
Turn around.

3365
03:01:25,879 --> 03:01:26,520
No, you idiot.

3366
03:01:26,520 --> 03:01:27,000
Whatever.

3367
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:37,510
Okay, someone's mutating.

3368
03:01:37,510 --> 03:01:47,370
Everybody seems to be in good spirits here.

3369
03:01:47,370 --> 03:01:49,260
Going up.

3370
03:01:49,260 --> 03:01:55,000
Did you even, Tuba didn't even eat anything.

3371
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:56,920
All right, we're gonna call this deer.

3372
03:01:56,920 --> 03:01:59,450
John Deere, right?

3373
03:01:59,530 --> 03:02:02,899
Let's just John.

3374
03:02:02,899 --> 03:02:03,780
Okay, I like John.

3375
03:02:04,340 --> 03:02:13,770
Ooh, Courage is really playful.

3376
03:02:13,770 --> 03:02:14,649
Uh, speak.

3377
03:02:16,549 --> 03:02:17,430
Very good.

3378
03:02:17,430 --> 03:02:25,739
Oh no, Spam has lived a long full life.

3379
03:02:25,739 --> 03:02:27,260
It's time for them to pass on.

3380
03:02:27,260 --> 03:02:32,629
Spam is gonna, is going away.

3381
03:02:35,079 --> 03:02:35,559
Oh no.

3382
03:02:36,440 --> 03:02:56,180
You okay?

3383
03:02:56,180 --> 03:02:58,250
Okay, goodbye.

3384
03:02:58,250 --> 03:03:31,770
All right, what do we got?

3385
03:03:31,770 --> 03:03:35,879
Cool.

3386
03:03:35,879 --> 03:03:41,100
Smush has a more green nose.

3387
03:03:41,100 --> 03:03:44,860
Lost a little bit of leg width.

3388
03:03:44,860 --> 03:03:46,379
Nose size got bigger too, okay.

3389
03:03:46,379 --> 03:03:48,260
You do what you need to do.

3390
03:03:48,899 --> 03:03:56,090
All right, John.

3391
03:03:56,090 --> 03:03:59,290
Um, somebody eat this.

3392
03:03:59,290 --> 03:04:00,489
Stop fighting, Courage.

3393
03:04:00,489 --> 03:04:00,889
Stop it.

3394
03:04:01,450 --> 03:04:03,270
Courage, go eat this.

3395
03:04:03,829 --> 03:04:05,959
Who do I want to live longer?

3396
03:04:05,959 --> 03:04:07,479
Because I don't think I want a memorial lifespan.

3397
03:04:08,649 --> 03:04:15,879
That's kind of, that sounds kind of mean, but Courage?

3398
03:04:16,680 --> 03:04:24,200
All right, Tuba's uh, was an interesting one.

3399
03:04:24,200 --> 03:04:24,520
Let's see.

3400
03:04:26,260 --> 03:04:26,819
Smaller?

3401
03:04:29,620 --> 03:04:30,100
Smaller.

3402
03:04:31,670 --> 03:04:32,549
Oh my god.

3403
03:04:34,229 --> 03:04:35,110
Tuba was huge.

3404
03:04:35,670 --> 03:04:39,590
Tuba was gigantic in the uh, in the breeding menu.

3405
03:04:39,590 --> 03:04:42,729
What did I feed you to make you do that?

3406
03:04:43,780 --> 03:04:44,500
You're so small.

3407
03:04:47,370 --> 03:04:47,850
All right, hold on.

3408
03:04:47,850 --> 03:04:50,090
I need to, let's just, might as well lean into it, right?

3409
03:04:50,090 --> 03:04:52,409
How do I, wide stance?

3410
03:04:52,409 --> 03:04:52,889
No, no, no.

3411
03:04:52,889 --> 03:04:53,930
I want like shrinking.

3412
03:04:54,649 --> 03:04:59,340
Long legs, intense pattern.

3413
03:05:01,989 --> 03:05:03,030
A big?

3414
03:05:03,030 --> 03:05:05,579
I want small.

3415
03:05:05,579 --> 03:05:06,739
This is random.

3416
03:05:10,940 --> 03:05:11,659
Short legs?

3417
03:05:11,659 --> 03:05:13,579
No, I want small body.

3418
03:05:17,459 --> 03:05:20,100
Thin body, skinny legs, tiny tail.

3419
03:05:20,100 --> 03:05:21,770
All right, dog treats.

3420
03:05:22,329 --> 03:05:28,739
Metallic sheen, legs.

3421
03:05:30,579 --> 03:05:33,190
Big from onion rings.

3422
03:05:35,590 --> 03:05:36,389
Big nose?

3423
03:05:36,389 --> 03:05:37,350
All right, this is from garlic.

3424
03:05:37,909 --> 03:05:41,030
All right, I need to feed them a person with a nose, garlic.

3425
03:05:44,219 --> 03:05:44,620
Wings?

3426
03:05:45,180 --> 03:05:47,030
Small, okay.

3427
03:05:47,030 --> 03:05:48,149
Chicken nuggets?

3428
03:05:48,149 --> 03:05:49,610
Chicken nuggets.

3429
03:05:49,610 --> 03:06:00,840
All right, Tuba, where are you?

3430
03:06:00,840 --> 03:06:01,340
Tuba!

3431
03:06:02,540 --> 03:06:03,040
Tuba!

3432
03:06:03,899 --> 03:06:04,700
Oh, slipping.

3433
03:06:04,700 --> 03:06:17,129
Okay.

3434
03:06:17,129 --> 03:06:17,770
Green?

3435
03:06:17,770 --> 03:06:22,659
Not fatter.

3436
03:06:22,659 --> 03:06:27,750
Looking a little green.

3437
03:06:27,750 --> 03:06:38,260
All right, can stop, can somebody eat this already and stop this nonsense?

3438
03:06:38,260 --> 03:06:44,340
Here, eat this body.

3439
03:06:44,340 --> 03:06:45,459
And I'm getting rid of this head.

3440
03:06:45,459 --> 03:06:48,309
It's just, it's like morbid looking.

3441
03:06:50,729 --> 03:06:52,409
Spud, get over there!

3442
03:06:52,409 --> 03:06:55,530
What are you, what are you guys doing?

3443
03:07:00,760 --> 03:07:01,559
Eat this.

3444
03:07:01,559 --> 03:07:08,569
All right, Tuba.

3445
03:07:08,569 --> 03:07:09,770
I want you to eat chicken nuggets.

3446
03:07:15,959 --> 03:07:17,239
What are they doing?

3447
03:07:17,239 --> 03:07:19,479
Tuba, get upstairs and eat chicken nuggets.

3448
03:07:19,479 --> 03:07:26,280
You're on a steady diet of chicken nuggets.

3449
03:07:26,280 --> 03:07:28,040
I want you to be like an inch tall.

3450
03:07:28,040 --> 03:07:38,200
Come on.

3451
03:07:38,200 --> 03:07:39,000
Very good.

3452
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:41,340
You want another one?

3453
03:07:41,340 --> 03:07:46,520
Have another one.

3454
03:07:46,520 --> 03:07:49,579
Watch out.

3455
03:07:49,579 --> 03:07:52,739
Okay, you're good.

3456
03:07:52,739 --> 03:07:57,059
What is that?

3457
03:07:57,059 --> 03:07:58,940
What did I get this?

3458
03:07:58,940 --> 03:08:04,809
Um, yeah, somebody play with that.

3459
03:08:04,809 --> 03:08:05,290
More?

3460
03:08:05,290 --> 03:08:05,930
He's already full.

3461
03:08:05,930 --> 03:08:07,049
I don't want to make a puke.

3462
03:08:07,049 --> 03:08:13,459
All right, I want you to eat before you mutate.

3463
03:08:13,459 --> 03:08:14,899
What do I want you, what do I want to do with you?

3464
03:08:19,829 --> 03:08:21,430
I want, what do I want to do?

3465
03:08:21,430 --> 03:08:23,659
Are you crying?

3466
03:08:24,219 --> 03:08:26,489
No?

3467
03:08:26,489 --> 03:08:27,049
Big tail?

3468
03:08:27,049 --> 03:08:28,250
All right, how do I make big tail?

3469
03:08:28,250 --> 03:08:30,870
What was it, garlic?

3470
03:08:30,870 --> 03:08:36,649
Flat body.

3471
03:08:38,680 --> 03:08:40,120
It was make big nose and wings?

3472
03:08:41,399 --> 03:08:42,680
Droopy face?

3473
03:08:42,680 --> 03:08:45,979
It was big nose.

3474
03:08:45,979 --> 03:08:46,940
All right, we'll do big nose.

3475
03:08:48,950 --> 03:08:50,309
Big nose is what?

3476
03:08:50,309 --> 03:08:55,610
It's no, no.

3477
03:08:55,610 --> 03:09:02,040
We'll do wings and big nose.

3478
03:09:02,040 --> 03:09:05,530
Long body, yellow body.

3479
03:09:05,530 --> 03:09:09,239
Garlic is wings?

3480
03:09:09,239 --> 03:09:10,969
What's this?

3481
03:09:10,969 --> 03:09:18,180
Garlic?

3482
03:09:18,180 --> 03:09:18,899
Uh, courage.

3483
03:09:18,899 --> 03:09:20,260
I need you to eat garlic.

3484
03:09:20,260 --> 03:09:22,549
Can I come up here, please?

3485
03:09:22,549 --> 03:09:31,059
I gotta, this place is a, I gotta clean up.

3486
03:09:31,059 --> 03:09:32,940
Over here?

3487
03:09:32,940 --> 03:09:36,860
Excuse me?

3488
03:09:36,860 --> 03:09:38,139
Garlic is nose.

3489
03:09:38,139 --> 03:09:46,420
Yeah, we'll do that first.

3490
03:09:46,420 --> 03:09:48,659
I want a huge nose.

3491
03:09:48,659 --> 03:09:59,049
And then we'll do wings.

3492
03:09:59,049 --> 03:09:59,690
You all right?

3493
03:09:59,690 --> 03:10:07,049
What are you doing?

3494
03:10:07,049 --> 03:10:07,850
Okay.

3495
03:10:07,850 --> 03:10:08,889
All right, you ready?

3496
03:10:08,889 --> 03:10:13,979
You kind of look like you smell like garlic.

3497
03:10:13,979 --> 03:10:15,100
What the fuck do you know?

3498
03:10:15,100 --> 03:10:28,629
Oh, and eat the orb too, yeah.

3499
03:10:28,629 --> 03:10:40,760
That'll make him live longer, right?

3500
03:10:40,760 --> 03:10:50,200
Okay, you can now mutate.

3501
03:10:50,200 --> 03:10:51,299
Go for it.

3502
03:10:51,299 --> 03:10:52,020
What about you?

3503
03:10:52,020 --> 03:10:54,340
What am I gonna do with you?

3504
03:10:54,340 --> 03:10:54,979
Big.

3505
03:10:54,979 --> 03:10:55,940
I want you to get bigger.

3506
03:10:55,940 --> 03:11:11,559
Very nice, let's do it.

3507
03:11:11,559 --> 03:11:15,559
Do an onion ring diet?

3508
03:11:15,559 --> 03:11:15,959
Yeah.

3509
03:11:15,959 --> 03:11:23,879
It's time to, I'm gonna do some cleanup.

3510
03:11:23,879 --> 03:11:33,989
All right, big nose.

3511
03:11:33,989 --> 03:11:38,790
Let's see it.

3512
03:11:38,790 --> 03:11:48,360
Did it work?

3513
03:11:48,360 --> 03:11:49,159
Yeah, it did.

3514
03:11:49,159 --> 03:11:51,479
Okay, his ears and nose got a little bigger.

3515
03:11:51,479 --> 03:11:56,409
Sorta.

3516
03:11:56,409 --> 03:12:14,620
Only 3% get bigger.

3517
03:12:14,620 --> 03:12:17,030
Mine is 19% back.

3518
03:12:17,030 --> 03:12:19,370
Well, actually that's, I don't know.

3519
03:12:19,370 --> 03:12:20,010
I can't tell.

3520
03:12:20,010 --> 03:12:29,850
I think it got a little bigger.

3521
03:12:29,850 --> 03:12:31,129
Okay, time to clean up.

3522
03:12:31,129 --> 03:12:36,549
I'm going on a full cleanup spray here.

3523
03:12:36,549 --> 03:12:38,629
I need, all right, build mode.

3524
03:12:38,629 --> 03:12:43,190
Get some of this shit out of the way.

3525
03:12:43,190 --> 03:12:43,989
Absurd.

3526
03:12:43,989 --> 03:12:49,270
There's too much, how do I clean this up?

3527
03:12:49,270 --> 03:13:00,069
I'll leave a little, but not all this shit.

3528
03:13:00,069 --> 03:13:06,969
I'll leave like a patch over here.

3529
03:13:06,969 --> 03:13:13,190
I'm realizing how fucking filthy it is here.

3530
03:13:13,190 --> 03:13:17,079
It's no wonder they're all dripping and sweaty and sick and stuff.

3531
03:13:17,079 --> 03:13:19,129
Underneath all the grass,

3532
03:13:19,129 --> 03:13:25,270
it's been a bunch of puke and piss and shit.

3533
03:13:25,270 --> 03:13:27,430
Oh my god, it's like roller coaster tycoon.

3534
03:13:28,840 --> 03:13:33,190
Oh my god, that's this bad.

3535
03:13:33,829 --> 03:13:51,659
I'm going to leave a patch over here.

3536
03:13:51,659 --> 03:13:56,059
I know they're pretty, but I don't like, no, it's too much.

3537
03:13:56,620 --> 03:14:06,860
Like that's fine.

3538
03:14:06,860 --> 03:14:07,420
Like right here.

3539
03:14:12,680 --> 03:14:17,239
They are launching out of the tube and sliding across all this filth.

3540
03:14:21,879 --> 03:14:28,090
Okay, oh my god, what a joke.

3541
03:14:28,809 --> 03:14:36,979
Maybe that's why they're not living that long.

3542
03:14:36,979 --> 03:14:49,579
It was under the, how was I supposed to see it?

3543
03:14:49,579 --> 03:14:50,459
It was under the grass.

3544
03:14:51,180 --> 03:15:04,940
Shit everywhere.

3545
03:15:08,120 --> 03:15:08,680
Jesus!

3546
03:15:11,049 --> 03:15:12,889
Sometimes they move way too fast.

3547
03:15:12,889 --> 03:15:24,170
I hope they can't get injured that way.

3548
03:15:32,200 --> 03:15:33,799
You can't even see it under here.

3549
03:15:33,799 --> 03:15:38,180
How was I supposed to see this?

3550
03:15:38,180 --> 03:15:40,260
Okay, that's much cleaner.

3551
03:15:40,260 --> 03:15:41,819
Looks much better.

3552
03:15:41,819 --> 03:15:51,079
What about the other rooms?

3553
03:15:51,079 --> 03:16:06,680
That's fine.

3554
03:16:06,680 --> 03:16:07,079
That's fine.

3555
03:16:07,079 --> 03:16:08,680
Okay, I need the other rooms now.

3556
03:16:08,680 --> 03:16:14,950
There's a bunch of, yeah, there's like piss and shit everywhere in here too.

3557
03:16:14,950 --> 03:16:32,090
Oh my god, you guys are, what are you doing over here?

3558
03:16:32,090 --> 03:16:33,129
Stop doing that.

3559
03:16:33,129 --> 03:16:37,260
They're starving.

3560
03:16:37,260 --> 03:16:38,459
Oh fuck, they are.

3561
03:16:38,459 --> 03:16:40,860
Oh my god, why, go eat, eat something.

3562
03:16:42,549 --> 03:16:43,670
Eat a banana, eat something.

3563
03:16:43,670 --> 03:16:45,510
Somebody eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat.

3564
03:16:45,510 --> 03:16:46,309
Oh my goodness.

3565
03:16:47,510 --> 03:16:49,030
Why can't you fucking move?

3566
03:16:50,090 --> 03:16:50,809
Eat something.

3567
03:16:52,260 --> 03:16:57,299
Why, what?

3568
03:16:57,299 --> 03:16:58,100
Good, good, good.

3569
03:16:58,100 --> 03:16:58,979
Okay, you're good, you're good.

3570
03:16:58,979 --> 03:17:00,180
Everything's fine.

3571
03:17:00,180 --> 03:17:06,069
This one, good, okay.

3572
03:17:06,069 --> 03:17:10,700
Stop fighting and eat.

3573
03:17:10,700 --> 03:17:24,520
Put him down.

3574
03:17:24,520 --> 03:17:28,409
Oh shit, where are you?

3575
03:17:28,409 --> 03:17:30,940
Stop fighting.

3576
03:17:30,940 --> 03:17:32,379
Stop fighting and eat.

3577
03:17:32,379 --> 03:17:34,760
Both of you.

3578
03:17:34,760 --> 03:17:37,690
Hey, put him down.

3579
03:17:37,690 --> 03:17:41,639
Spud, put him down.

3580
03:17:41,639 --> 03:17:42,440
That's it.

3581
03:17:42,440 --> 03:17:45,270
Put him, put him down.

3582
03:17:45,270 --> 03:17:47,059
Put him down.

3583
03:17:47,059 --> 03:17:47,700
Let him go.

3584
03:17:48,340 --> 03:17:48,979
Let him go.

3585
03:17:51,260 --> 03:17:51,899
Let him go.

3586
03:17:53,500 --> 03:17:54,379
Let him go.

3587
03:17:55,239 --> 03:17:55,879
Let him go.

3588
03:17:57,190 --> 03:17:58,069
How do I stop?

3589
03:18:00,139 --> 03:18:01,020
Let him go.

3590
03:18:03,260 --> 03:18:04,219
Who has who?

3591
03:18:05,379 --> 03:18:06,579
Oh my god, it's not you.

3592
03:18:06,579 --> 03:18:07,059
It's you.

3593
03:18:09,479 --> 03:18:12,709
Put him down.

3594
03:18:12,709 --> 03:18:13,750
Oh my god.

3595
03:18:16,629 --> 03:18:22,409
No, he sounds like a Minecraft zombie.

3596
03:18:22,409 --> 03:18:24,780
All right, I'm losing control here.

3597
03:18:24,780 --> 03:18:26,139
Oh my god, are you okay?

3598
03:18:26,860 --> 03:18:33,690
Here, eat a banana, quick.

3599
03:18:33,690 --> 03:18:34,649
It's okay.

3600
03:18:34,649 --> 03:18:42,760
What do you want?

3601
03:18:42,760 --> 03:18:45,559
You want anything else for food before you do pupate?

3602
03:18:45,559 --> 03:18:47,719
Come here.

3603
03:18:47,719 --> 03:18:49,000
Um, have another banana.

3604
03:18:49,319 --> 03:18:50,520
No, you like coconuts, don't you?

3605
03:18:52,309 --> 03:18:52,870
Here.

3606
03:18:52,870 --> 03:18:56,200
Wait, this is dirt.

3607
03:18:56,200 --> 03:18:58,649
Have some honey.

3608
03:18:58,649 --> 03:19:03,030
Spud is not happy right now.

3609
03:19:03,030 --> 03:19:08,180
There you go.

3610
03:19:08,180 --> 03:19:14,260
Okay.

3611
03:19:14,260 --> 03:19:17,290
All right, now go relax.

3612
03:19:17,290 --> 03:19:19,139
You.

3613
03:19:19,139 --> 03:19:20,500
You're in big trouble.

3614
03:19:20,500 --> 03:19:23,209
You're in big trouble.

3615
03:19:30,260 --> 03:19:32,020
Smush.

3616
03:19:32,020 --> 03:19:33,379
He's trying to sit there.

3617
03:19:33,379 --> 03:19:34,260
He's so hungry.

3618
03:19:35,540 --> 03:19:37,139
Oh my god, what do I do?

3619
03:19:37,139 --> 03:19:38,659
Quick, quick, quick.

3620
03:19:38,659 --> 03:19:39,620
Please move out of the way.

3621
03:19:41,510 --> 03:19:42,389
Chicken nuggets and shit.

3622
03:19:42,389 --> 03:19:43,350
Here, eat a chicken nugget.

3623
03:19:44,229 --> 03:19:45,110
I know you want to eat it.

3624
03:19:45,110 --> 03:19:45,909
I know, I know, I know.

3625
03:19:45,909 --> 03:19:46,389
Here, here, here.

3626
03:19:46,389 --> 03:19:47,510
Chicken nugget, eat it.

3627
03:19:47,510 --> 03:19:49,000
Have some garlic.

3628
03:19:49,879 --> 03:19:50,840
Have some garlic, quick.

3629
03:19:52,180 --> 03:19:53,219
Have some garlic.

3630
03:19:56,389 --> 03:19:58,469
Get off the center focus.

3631
03:19:58,469 --> 03:19:59,350
Eat some garlic.

3632
03:20:01,270 --> 03:20:02,309
Eat some garlic, please.

3633
03:20:03,639 --> 03:20:04,440
And chicken nugget.

3634
03:20:04,440 --> 03:20:07,319
You, where are you?

3635
03:20:07,319 --> 03:20:09,159
You have this food in front of you right now.

3636
03:20:09,159 --> 03:20:12,819
Eat it.

3637
03:20:12,819 --> 03:20:13,299
Move him.

3638
03:20:14,659 --> 03:20:16,100
It's in front of you.

3639
03:20:17,129 --> 03:20:19,270
Eat it, it's right here.

3640
03:20:19,270 --> 03:20:20,149
What's wrong with him?

3641
03:20:21,290 --> 03:20:21,770
Eat that.

3642
03:20:31,530 --> 03:20:32,889
Somebody just farted.

3643
03:20:32,889 --> 03:20:33,850
Who does it?

3644
03:20:33,850 --> 03:20:34,569
I gotta relax.

3645
03:20:44,120 --> 03:20:45,159
I'm sorry.

3646
03:20:45,159 --> 03:20:46,280
I'm sorry.

3647
03:20:46,360 --> 03:20:47,319
I'm sorry.

3648
03:20:47,319 --> 03:20:48,040
I'm sorry.

3649
03:20:48,040 --> 03:20:48,920
What do you want to eat?

3650
03:21:02,569 --> 03:21:03,930
This camera is kind of, come on.

3651
03:21:04,860 --> 03:21:05,340
Eat that.

3652
03:21:06,059 --> 03:21:07,420
Stop jumping around and piss.

3653
03:21:13,340 --> 03:21:14,780
Eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it.

3654
03:21:14,780 --> 03:21:16,299
Eat, eat, it's delicious, isn't it?

3655
03:21:16,299 --> 03:21:17,180
Okay, we need some more, we do,

3656
03:21:17,180 --> 03:21:18,540
something, that's not just junk food.

3657
03:21:22,170 --> 03:21:28,020
There we go, all right, all right, all right.

3658
03:21:28,020 --> 03:21:30,739
Very good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.

3659
03:21:30,739 --> 03:21:31,379
Very good.

3660
03:21:31,940 --> 03:21:33,059
Very good, it's okay.

3661
03:21:33,059 --> 03:21:33,459
Very good.

3662
03:21:34,649 --> 03:21:35,690
I was too busy cleaning.

3663
03:21:35,690 --> 03:21:37,290
I didn't realize all this shit was going on up here.

3664
03:21:38,809 --> 03:21:39,530
Everybody all right?

3665
03:21:51,299 --> 03:21:53,139
I need to, can I hire someone?

3666
03:21:53,860 --> 03:21:55,459
You've been doing this for like an hour.

3667
03:21:57,000 --> 03:21:59,559
Honest to God, Raw has been doing this

3668
03:21:59,559 --> 03:22:01,000
for like a full hour in the game.

3669
03:22:24,500 --> 03:22:26,340
I don't think Raw can walk.

3670
03:22:26,899 --> 03:22:32,629
Oh my goodness.

3671
03:22:34,469 --> 03:22:36,389
No, get away from this, stop.

3672
03:22:37,030 --> 03:23:16,920
All right, now go to sleep.

3673
03:23:16,920 --> 03:23:18,600
Not seeing very much growth here.

3674
03:23:18,600 --> 03:23:20,680
Squarie is getting old.

3675
03:23:20,680 --> 03:23:23,559
Okay, all right, I need to see some growth here.

3676
03:23:23,559 --> 03:23:29,459
All right, that was tuba.

3677
03:23:29,459 --> 03:23:34,860
We wanted tuba to shrink, which we did.

3678
03:23:34,860 --> 03:23:36,139
Lost a little bit of size.

3679
03:23:36,139 --> 03:23:41,420
Okay, that's what we wanted.

3680
03:23:41,420 --> 03:23:54,870
Hey John, okay.

3681
03:23:54,870 --> 03:23:56,469
Legs got a little thicker, that's good.

3682
03:23:56,469 --> 03:23:59,379
All right, courage.

3683
03:23:59,379 --> 03:24:03,510
I kind of screwed up courage a little bit

3684
03:24:03,510 --> 03:24:06,299
because I was trying to do nose and ears, right?

3685
03:24:06,860 --> 03:24:08,540
It seems like color is kind of changing a little bit.

3686
03:24:10,219 --> 03:24:11,739
No size went up 10% though.

3687
03:24:11,739 --> 03:24:12,299
That's huge.

3688
03:24:14,250 --> 03:24:14,569
Huge.

3689
03:24:17,579 --> 03:24:18,940
Okay, I need to start storing people

3690
03:24:18,940 --> 03:24:20,780
because I don't have enough space.

3691
03:24:20,780 --> 03:24:25,139
I'm going to store Squarie.

3692
03:24:25,139 --> 03:24:27,819
I'm going to store two people.

3693
03:24:27,819 --> 03:24:30,379
I'm running out of real estate here.

3694
03:24:30,379 --> 03:24:41,399
Let's give you like a coconut or something

3695
03:24:41,399 --> 03:24:43,479
and then we're going to put you in the storage unit.

3696
03:24:44,200 --> 03:24:49,319
We're going to try to try that.

3697
03:24:49,319 --> 03:24:51,000
Eat that before I put you in the storage.

3698
03:24:51,639 --> 03:24:59,799
Why are they so dumb?

3699
03:25:00,440 --> 03:25:07,799
Just eat it.

3700
03:25:12,579 --> 03:25:18,870
Okay, who is going?

3701
03:25:18,870 --> 03:25:19,989
I need to go to my menu here.

3702
03:25:19,989 --> 03:25:20,950
Okay, storage.

3703
03:25:22,620 --> 03:25:27,450
I'm going to take Squarie.

3704
03:25:27,450 --> 03:25:30,139
We're going to store Squarie.

3705
03:25:30,139 --> 03:25:32,969
Who else do I want to store for now?

3706
03:25:34,280 --> 03:25:35,159
I want courage out there.

3707
03:25:35,159 --> 03:25:35,879
I want John out there.

3708
03:25:35,879 --> 03:25:36,840
I want Ra out there.

3709
03:25:36,840 --> 03:25:39,379
I want maybe Sherbert or Spud.

3710
03:25:39,379 --> 03:25:47,159
Or I think Sherbert gets, is it broom?

3711
03:25:47,159 --> 03:25:53,559
Sherbert's cool.

3712
03:25:53,559 --> 03:25:54,600
Yeah, well, sorry.

3713
03:25:57,379 --> 03:25:59,299
Oh, I have mud as a stored core.

3714
03:26:03,610 --> 03:26:09,399
Okay, let's clean up.

3715
03:26:09,399 --> 03:26:12,790
Ra's getting old.

3716
03:26:12,790 --> 03:26:14,629
Oh, no, we got to breed another.

3717
03:26:14,629 --> 03:26:16,790
We got to have Ra come out and breed.

3718
03:26:16,790 --> 03:26:29,719
Okay, we might make sure they're happy.

3719
03:26:29,719 --> 03:26:32,629
How are you doing over here, Tuba?

3720
03:26:32,629 --> 03:26:36,059
Do you want to have chicken nugget?

3721
03:26:36,059 --> 03:26:38,579
Okay, go play with something.

3722
03:26:38,579 --> 03:26:40,020
There's tons of toys everywhere.

3723
03:26:40,579 --> 03:26:46,520
Here, come here.

3724
03:26:58,540 --> 03:26:59,260
Play with this.

3725
03:26:59,260 --> 03:27:02,649
That's good.

3726
03:27:02,649 --> 03:27:03,690
Yeah, play with that.

3727
03:27:03,690 --> 03:27:07,500
I don't want to do that.

3728
03:27:07,500 --> 03:27:08,860
Okay, well, come here.

3729
03:27:08,860 --> 03:27:15,399
Clean up.

3730
03:27:16,620 --> 03:27:18,620
Do you understand I spent the last 20 minutes

3731
03:27:18,620 --> 03:27:21,020
just air frying whatever it is,

3732
03:27:21,020 --> 03:27:22,540
this stuff all over the ground.

3733
03:27:22,540 --> 03:27:23,979
It's back immediately.

3734
03:27:24,059 --> 03:27:36,739
The broom?

3735
03:27:36,739 --> 03:27:43,100
This will remove all physics objects from this room.

3736
03:27:43,100 --> 03:27:44,059
Food will be destroyed.

3737
03:27:44,059 --> 03:27:45,340
Eggs and seeds will be collected.

3738
03:27:45,340 --> 03:27:46,700
Toys and dog cores will be put away.

3739
03:27:47,260 --> 03:27:49,030
Unopened capsules will be lost.

3740
03:27:49,590 --> 03:27:51,799
Do I have any unopened capsules?

3741
03:27:52,440 --> 03:27:53,899
I got to check that first.

3742
03:27:55,159 --> 03:27:56,760
I don't want to do that to let me be certain of it.

3743
03:27:57,479 --> 03:28:03,909
I'm fine.

3744
03:28:04,469 --> 03:28:05,610
Let me just check.

3745
03:28:06,170 --> 03:28:12,549
Okay, clean.

3746
03:28:12,549 --> 03:28:16,790
Guys, that doesn't do anything.

3747
03:28:17,719 --> 03:28:20,120
There's still piss all over the ground in every room.

3748
03:28:20,920 --> 03:28:25,829
Oh, my God, you've been in the cocoon for so long.

3749
03:28:25,829 --> 03:28:37,260
Oh, geez.

3750
03:28:37,340 --> 03:28:39,670
Spud's gotten bigger.

3751
03:28:39,670 --> 03:28:44,889
10% back legs.

3752
03:28:44,889 --> 03:29:02,219
Too much like two, three percent across the board for body.

3753
03:29:02,219 --> 03:29:03,979
Do you spud and raw right now?

3754
03:29:03,979 --> 03:29:05,260
I will in just a second.

3755
03:29:05,260 --> 03:29:23,639
Okay, everything all right up here?

3756
03:29:23,639 --> 03:29:29,850
Smush.

3757
03:29:29,850 --> 03:29:30,969
Tube is not doing all right.

3758
03:29:30,969 --> 03:29:31,930
Tube, you need to go to bed.

3759
03:29:34,120 --> 03:29:38,520
Oh, what's wrong?

3760
03:29:38,520 --> 03:29:39,479
What, did he just puke?

3761
03:29:40,540 --> 03:29:41,180
Oh, no.

3762
03:29:42,139 --> 03:29:42,860
It's okay.

3763
03:29:42,860 --> 03:29:50,500
Are they sick?

3764
03:29:50,500 --> 03:29:51,860
Oh, courage is going to do it.

3765
03:29:51,860 --> 03:29:57,510
Come on.

3766
03:29:57,510 --> 03:29:59,829
Yes, very good.

3767
03:29:59,829 --> 03:30:28,299
Very, very good.

3768
03:30:28,299 --> 03:30:29,819
Jesus Christ.

3769
03:30:29,819 --> 03:30:46,620
Are we finally fucking clean?

3770
03:30:46,620 --> 03:30:53,579
All right, we're good.

3771
03:30:55,219 --> 03:31:00,649
John, go eat a honeycomb.

3772
03:31:00,649 --> 03:31:01,149
No.

3773
03:31:02,889 --> 03:31:06,899
Okay, we need to breed before it's too late.

3774
03:31:06,899 --> 03:31:13,370
I got another room.

3775
03:31:13,370 --> 03:31:17,559
I don't have any eggs.

3776
03:31:17,559 --> 03:31:22,180
I'm out of eggs.

3777
03:31:22,180 --> 03:31:23,059
What do you want for food?

3778
03:31:23,059 --> 03:31:27,639
You want a gourd?

3779
03:31:27,639 --> 03:31:28,569
Give it a try.

3780
03:31:29,209 --> 03:31:32,329
But how are you doing?

3781
03:31:32,329 --> 03:31:33,879
You don't look so good.

3782
03:31:33,879 --> 03:31:34,920
You're kind of struggling over here.

3783
03:31:36,659 --> 03:31:40,389
Uh-oh.

3784
03:31:40,389 --> 03:31:42,629
Wait, I wasn't ready to say goodbye.

3785
03:31:42,629 --> 03:31:45,770
I wasn't ready to say goodbye.

3786
03:31:45,770 --> 03:32:22,260
Oh, courage coming downstairs.

3787
03:32:22,260 --> 03:32:24,579
No, don't let John Deere eat that first.

3788
03:32:24,579 --> 03:32:40,020
Go eat the eraser.

3789
03:32:40,020 --> 03:32:40,739
You don't want it?

3790
03:32:40,819 --> 03:33:14,579
Don't eat that.

3791
03:33:14,579 --> 03:33:19,610
I'm trying just to get it out of here.

3792
03:33:19,610 --> 03:33:24,809
Get it out.

3793
03:33:24,809 --> 03:33:27,340
How come I can't take this out of here?

3794
03:33:27,340 --> 03:33:39,799
How to expel?

3795
03:33:39,799 --> 03:33:44,409
Oh, okay.

3796
03:33:44,409 --> 03:33:45,770
All right, we're going to have the memorial be...

3797
03:33:46,649 --> 03:33:49,530
We're going to have a different room.

3798
03:33:49,530 --> 03:33:50,569
Okay, different room.

3799
03:33:50,569 --> 03:33:53,030
This is going to be the memorial is going to be over here.

3800
03:33:53,030 --> 03:34:13,079
Is it going to be like a somber area?

3801
03:34:13,079 --> 03:34:17,270
This is the memorial.

3802
03:34:17,270 --> 03:34:31,180
Not like a comfy dog chair or something, right?

3803
03:34:31,180 --> 03:34:35,579
And I don't know.

3804
03:34:35,579 --> 03:34:42,760
Maybe like something.

3805
03:34:42,760 --> 03:34:45,829
What would a dog, what would like a dog?

3806
03:34:45,829 --> 03:34:47,270
No, this is, I don't like this.

3807
03:34:47,270 --> 03:34:51,719
Not mud.

3808
03:34:51,719 --> 03:34:53,239
No, something comfy.

3809
03:34:53,239 --> 03:34:54,860
I'm comfortable.

3810
03:34:54,860 --> 03:34:58,870
That's kind of comfy.

3811
03:34:58,870 --> 03:35:03,260
This is comfy.

3812
03:35:03,260 --> 03:35:05,879
Put a tree in there.

3813
03:35:05,879 --> 03:35:07,159
Yeah, I'll put a tree in here.

3814
03:35:07,159 --> 03:35:13,350
I'll put, yeah, this tree is going to go up here.

3815
03:35:13,350 --> 03:35:37,659
All right, now we need to move the memorials here.

3816
03:35:37,659 --> 03:35:40,709
There's one up here.

3817
03:35:40,709 --> 03:35:44,600
How do I take this with me?

3818
03:35:44,600 --> 03:35:50,649
I like, how do I move this to the other room?

3819
03:35:50,649 --> 03:35:58,260
I just remove the core.

3820
03:35:58,260 --> 03:35:59,139
How do I store it?

3821
03:35:59,139 --> 03:36:01,159
Remove core?

3822
03:36:09,450 --> 03:36:10,329
Put away.

3823
03:36:10,329 --> 03:36:25,829
Okay, so now, so now we're going to...

3824
03:36:25,829 --> 03:36:27,899
Oh, they all need to mutate.

3825
03:36:27,899 --> 03:36:29,659
All right, I'll be with you in one moment.

3826
03:36:29,659 --> 03:36:36,760
Hold on everybody.

3827
03:36:36,760 --> 03:36:37,639
Oh my God.

3828
03:36:38,950 --> 03:36:40,469
Okay, where is this thing?

3829
03:36:40,469 --> 03:36:45,700
Gravity machine?

3830
03:36:45,700 --> 03:36:49,209
Okay, so now where the hell is this here?

3831
03:36:49,209 --> 03:36:51,659
Stored cores.

3832
03:36:51,659 --> 03:37:05,860
Bring out.

3833
03:37:05,860 --> 03:37:07,540
I got to increase my like mouse sensitivity.

3834
03:37:07,540 --> 03:37:08,579
This is like horrible.

3835
03:37:08,579 --> 03:37:13,690
How do I do that?

3836
03:37:13,690 --> 03:37:31,420
Am I not?

3837
03:37:31,420 --> 03:37:32,379
One DPI.

3838
03:37:32,379 --> 03:37:36,229
I know, I'm like fucking move up and down.

3839
03:37:36,229 --> 03:37:40,790
Okay, so this is not bad.

3840
03:37:40,790 --> 03:37:53,209
I want to make them a little bigger though.

3841
03:37:53,209 --> 03:37:54,889
No one's going to be bigger than anyone else.

3842
03:37:54,889 --> 03:38:03,059
Actually, you got to be a little bit bigger.

3843
03:38:03,059 --> 03:38:08,899
This was mud.

3844
03:38:08,899 --> 03:38:10,979
Mud was a good dog, was one of the first dogs.

3845
03:38:10,979 --> 03:38:13,819
And this was raw.

3846
03:38:13,819 --> 03:38:20,979
Always made us laugh.

3847
03:38:20,979 --> 03:38:47,510
Let's get some mutations going.

3848
03:38:47,510 --> 03:38:48,629
Feed your dogs.

3849
03:38:48,629 --> 03:38:54,229
Come on, toad, whatever your name is.

3850
03:38:54,229 --> 03:38:54,870
Hurry up.

3851
03:38:54,870 --> 03:39:01,000
Oh, an egg.

3852
03:39:01,000 --> 03:39:04,149
Okay, you come out here because you need to eat.

3853
03:39:13,430 --> 03:39:14,069
All right, spud.

3854
03:39:14,709 --> 03:39:21,420
Let's give you some cheese.

3855
03:39:21,420 --> 03:39:23,180
And then I want you to...

3856
03:39:23,180 --> 03:39:32,360
Well, let's just rub your belly first.

3857
03:39:32,360 --> 03:39:33,239
Who was about to die?

3858
03:39:33,239 --> 03:39:34,200
Somebody was, right?

3859
03:39:34,200 --> 03:39:40,040
Some cheese.

3860
03:39:40,040 --> 03:39:44,790
Revive the dead dogs.

3861
03:39:44,790 --> 03:39:46,950
I think you can use their cores.

3862
03:39:46,950 --> 03:39:50,809
Spud, how can I help you here?

3863
03:39:56,229 --> 03:39:58,309
Turn, rotate.

3864
03:39:58,309 --> 03:40:00,979
How do I rotate them?

3865
03:40:00,979 --> 03:40:02,100
Okay, here we go.

3866
03:40:02,100 --> 03:40:04,040
Here, eat.

3867
03:40:04,040 --> 03:40:08,500
Have a burrito too.

3868
03:40:08,500 --> 03:40:10,149
It's way more filling and you're huge.

3869
03:40:11,209 --> 03:40:20,469
Eat it.

3870
03:40:20,469 --> 03:40:21,190
Way more filling.

3871
03:40:21,190 --> 03:40:21,670
That's good.

3872
03:40:21,670 --> 03:40:22,709
Okay, you're good.

3873
03:40:22,709 --> 03:40:25,610
Let's see what we get.

3874
03:40:25,610 --> 03:40:33,940
Color change.

3875
03:40:33,940 --> 03:40:35,780
Okay, smush is now an adult.

3876
03:40:35,780 --> 03:40:40,940
Smaller ears.

3877
03:40:40,940 --> 03:40:46,340
Piss everywhere.

3878
03:40:46,340 --> 03:40:56,360
I got to be more on top of this.

3879
03:40:56,360 --> 03:41:06,620
Piss and shit everywhere.

3880
03:41:06,620 --> 03:41:09,719
Ooh, new coat.

3881
03:41:12,899 --> 03:41:19,079
A little lighter.

3882
03:41:19,079 --> 03:41:21,370
Oh no, snout reduced.

3883
03:41:21,370 --> 03:41:22,659
That's not what we want.

3884
03:41:22,659 --> 03:41:26,649
A little glossier.

3885
03:41:29,260 --> 03:41:30,540
I want to give courage to wings.

3886
03:41:30,540 --> 03:41:45,350
What's the food that gives wings?

3887
03:41:45,350 --> 03:41:47,209
I'm a red bull.

3888
03:41:50,940 --> 03:41:53,559
What gives wings?

3889
03:41:53,559 --> 03:41:58,600
Wings gut bacteria is the yellow one.

3890
03:41:58,600 --> 03:41:59,559
Tiny wings.

3891
03:41:59,559 --> 03:42:02,379
Okay, this is from onion rings, gourds, and...

3892
03:42:02,379 --> 03:42:03,739
Okay, let's see if we can get it from here.

3893
03:42:03,739 --> 03:42:26,489
We need a guava over here.

3894
03:42:26,489 --> 03:42:31,979
We want you to grow some wings.

3895
03:42:32,059 --> 03:42:41,780
There you go.

3896
03:42:41,780 --> 03:42:43,559
The yellow one, right?

3897
03:42:43,559 --> 03:42:57,540
All right, now you can go sleep.

3898
03:42:57,540 --> 03:42:58,739
Eat good, courage.

3899
03:42:58,739 --> 03:43:05,459
Not much change for John.

3900
03:43:05,459 --> 03:43:08,340
A lot glossier.

3901
03:43:08,340 --> 03:43:10,469
Interesting.

3902
03:43:10,469 --> 03:43:17,020
Isn't this just bug snacks?

3903
03:43:19,559 --> 03:43:20,840
It's a little different, I think.

3904
03:43:20,840 --> 03:43:29,340
Tube is still shrinking.

3905
03:43:29,340 --> 03:43:32,790
Even smaller.

3906
03:43:32,790 --> 03:43:34,229
Look at how cute Tube is.

3907
03:43:34,229 --> 03:43:35,700
Tube is so cute.

3908
03:43:35,700 --> 03:43:37,610
I got to pee again.

3909
03:43:37,610 --> 03:43:38,170
God damn it.

3910
03:43:38,170 --> 03:43:38,969
All right, I'll be right back.

3911
03:43:40,010 --> 03:43:41,290
No more BRBs after this.

3912
03:43:41,290 --> 03:43:51,879
How do I pause the game?

3913
03:43:51,879 --> 03:44:00,299
Can you pause?

3914
03:44:00,299 --> 03:44:01,020
There's no pause?

3915
03:44:02,729 --> 03:44:03,610
Well, then here.

3916
03:44:03,610 --> 03:44:04,010
Just watch.

3917
03:44:04,569 --> 03:44:05,530
You guys can just watch.

3918
03:44:05,530 --> 03:44:07,639
I'll be right back.

3919
03:44:07,639 --> 03:45:59,290
What did I miss?

3920
03:46:00,569 --> 03:46:01,690
Nothing bad happened while I was gone?

3921
03:46:04,250 --> 03:46:06,090
Oh, also, now that there's a lot of people here.

3922
03:46:08,629 --> 03:46:12,010
July 14th is the baseball stream.

3923
03:46:12,010 --> 03:46:14,600
If you want to see that stream,

3924
03:46:14,600 --> 03:46:15,479
mark it on your calendar.

3925
03:46:16,409 --> 03:46:17,209
Baseball.

3926
03:46:17,209 --> 03:46:20,010
The Germa Baseball Association will commence.

3927
03:46:20,010 --> 03:46:21,559
Start and end.

3928
03:46:21,559 --> 03:46:23,770
Begin on July 14th.

3929
03:46:25,750 --> 03:46:26,629
Mark it.

3930
03:46:26,629 --> 03:46:32,469
Okay, you're tired.

3931
03:46:34,700 --> 03:46:36,700
I have access to an egg.

3932
03:46:36,700 --> 03:46:44,020
What do I want to do here?

3933
03:46:44,020 --> 03:46:46,459
I think I want to wait till...

3934
03:46:46,459 --> 03:46:49,209
Okay, once Tube is old enough.

3935
03:46:49,209 --> 03:46:51,190
Should I do spud and...

3936
03:46:52,920 --> 03:46:53,239
Where?

3937
03:46:53,239 --> 03:46:55,079
No, spud and smush?

3938
03:46:55,079 --> 03:47:00,260
I don't know.

3939
03:47:00,260 --> 03:47:01,940
Yeah, wait till Courage is old enough.

3940
03:47:01,940 --> 03:47:05,000
Courage and John, I think would be good.

3941
03:47:05,000 --> 03:47:10,040
I'll wait.

3942
03:47:10,040 --> 03:47:11,299
I think I only have one egg.

3943
03:47:11,860 --> 03:47:13,139
Yeah, I have one egg.

3944
03:47:13,139 --> 03:47:16,659
All right, spud.

3945
03:47:16,659 --> 03:47:22,760
I'm gonna need you to chill out.

3946
03:47:22,760 --> 03:47:23,319
Go to sleep.

3947
03:47:28,180 --> 03:47:29,110
Get some sleep.

3948
03:47:29,750 --> 03:47:35,030
Okay, you're stressed out.

3949
03:47:35,030 --> 03:47:35,270
Why?

3950
03:47:35,270 --> 03:47:35,750
What's wrong?

3951
03:47:36,309 --> 03:47:38,629
What's wrong?

3952
03:47:38,629 --> 03:47:39,030
You're okay?

3953
03:47:39,750 --> 03:47:43,030
Why are you so stressed out?

3954
03:47:43,590 --> 03:47:53,659
All right, relax.

3955
03:47:53,659 --> 03:47:54,620
All right, wings.

3956
03:47:54,620 --> 03:47:56,459
I need to feed Courage more stuff.

3957
03:48:01,020 --> 03:48:02,459
Courage, I want wings, which is...

3958
03:48:02,459 --> 03:48:03,579
Okay, Courage, come under.

3959
03:48:04,379 --> 03:48:11,750
Come over here, Courage.

3960
03:48:15,159 --> 03:48:15,799
Get over here.

3961
03:48:17,690 --> 03:48:20,139
Spud, please move out of the way.

3962
03:48:20,139 --> 03:48:21,180
No, no, no, no, no, no.

3963
03:48:21,180 --> 03:48:21,819
Put that down.

3964
03:48:21,819 --> 03:48:23,100
You need to eat because you need to get wings.

3965
03:48:23,100 --> 03:48:23,979
I want you to grow wings.

3966
03:48:24,540 --> 03:48:26,389
There you go.

3967
03:48:26,389 --> 03:48:36,409
Good dog.

3968
03:48:36,409 --> 03:48:37,930
Okay, now you can do whatever you want.

3969
03:48:37,930 --> 03:48:44,459
I don't know how you can be so dumb.

3970
03:48:44,459 --> 03:48:50,440
Oh, an egg.

3971
03:48:50,440 --> 03:48:56,819
He's trying to eat the food, but he...

3972
03:48:56,819 --> 03:48:58,260
You're on the wrong side, man.

3973
03:48:58,899 --> 03:49:02,360
All right, everyone's doing okay.

3974
03:49:08,860 --> 03:49:10,540
One more mutation and we'll be able to do it again.

3975
03:49:20,739 --> 03:49:23,829
Here, have some honey.

3976
03:49:23,829 --> 03:49:27,370
Have some honey.

3977
03:49:27,370 --> 03:49:28,250
There you go.

3978
03:49:28,250 --> 03:49:29,049
There you go.

3979
03:49:29,049 --> 03:49:30,649
That's a good dog.

3980
03:49:30,649 --> 03:49:31,930
There you go.

3981
03:49:31,930 --> 03:49:36,180
Go to sleep if you need to.

3982
03:49:36,180 --> 03:49:45,530
MonkaS.

3983
03:49:45,530 --> 03:49:49,100
Okay, everyone seems to be in good spirits.

3984
03:49:49,100 --> 03:49:49,500
Spud?

3985
03:49:49,500 --> 03:49:51,100
I don't know what's wrong with Spud.

3986
03:49:51,100 --> 03:49:52,329
I really don't.

3987
03:49:52,329 --> 03:49:53,209
He's not doing great.

3988
03:49:54,090 --> 03:49:59,879
He can't like walk around to get food.

3989
03:49:59,879 --> 03:50:03,110
You need to get some sleep.

3990
03:50:03,110 --> 03:50:05,059
It's so quiet up here.

3991
03:50:05,059 --> 03:50:06,500
Just go relax in the corner.

3992
03:50:06,500 --> 03:50:07,639
What could he say?

3993
03:50:07,639 --> 03:50:09,000
He has some trouble moving.

3994
03:50:09,000 --> 03:50:09,239
Why?

3995
03:50:09,959 --> 03:50:12,260
Come on, you can eat it.

3996
03:50:18,700 --> 03:50:19,739
Now go...

3997
03:50:19,739 --> 03:50:29,100
Okay, good.

3998
03:50:29,100 --> 03:50:29,979
I want you to be healthy.

3999
03:50:30,860 --> 03:50:31,979
Not all screwed up.

4000
03:50:32,620 --> 03:50:37,420
Okay.

4001
03:50:37,420 --> 03:50:43,180
Everybody seems to be fine.

4002
03:50:45,659 --> 03:50:46,059
Easy.

4003
03:50:46,780 --> 03:50:50,500
Herd, you want some more guava?

4004
03:50:51,909 --> 03:50:52,709
Eat it.

4005
03:50:52,709 --> 03:50:56,149
Yeah, because I'm trying to get the wings.

4006
03:51:03,639 --> 03:51:04,520
Very good.

4007
03:51:04,520 --> 03:51:11,500
The man just needed a ham slider.

4008
03:51:11,500 --> 03:51:15,690
All right, you're awake.

4009
03:51:15,690 --> 03:51:16,489
Eat another one of those.

4010
03:51:16,489 --> 03:51:16,729
I don't know.

4011
03:51:16,729 --> 03:51:18,170
I figured out this does something weird.

4012
03:51:24,100 --> 03:51:25,540
Eat another ham slider.

4013
03:51:25,540 --> 03:51:27,219
Train them to do stuff?

4014
03:51:32,540 --> 03:51:33,819
That was a papaya?

4015
03:51:33,819 --> 03:51:36,540
That's all right.

4016
03:51:36,540 --> 03:51:38,139
I don't know if I want to breed Spud.

4017
03:51:39,100 --> 03:51:40,860
Spud can't really walk.

4018
03:51:40,860 --> 03:51:47,100
Spud's a really good dog, but he can't really walk around.

4019
03:51:50,500 --> 03:51:51,780
He's a lot of trouble moving around.

4020
03:51:51,780 --> 03:51:52,899
I don't know why.

4021
03:51:52,899 --> 03:51:54,500
His body seems to be proportionally fine.

4022
03:51:55,139 --> 03:51:56,579
His body's like perfectly fine.

4023
03:51:59,129 --> 03:52:00,329
Maybe they're too far forward?

4024
03:52:03,620 --> 03:52:04,579
He's having a lot of trouble.

4025
03:52:16,010 --> 03:52:16,649
All right, smush.

4026
03:52:16,649 --> 03:52:17,370
Eat something.

4027
03:52:17,370 --> 03:52:25,000
Have some.

4028
03:52:26,969 --> 03:52:27,610
Go to bed.

4029
03:52:28,340 --> 03:52:28,899
Go to bed.

4030
03:52:38,680 --> 03:52:40,360
Here, eat banana.

4031
03:52:40,360 --> 03:52:44,309
Go to bed.

4032
03:52:44,309 --> 03:52:46,379
Go to bed.

4033
03:52:57,930 --> 03:52:58,729
No, what are you doing?

4034
03:53:00,870 --> 03:53:01,350
What are you doing?

4035
03:53:01,909 --> 03:53:03,209
What are you doing?

4036
03:53:03,209 --> 03:53:03,930
Stop it.

4037
03:53:03,930 --> 03:53:05,860
Oh, we're doing my Wellington.

4038
03:53:05,860 --> 03:53:10,520
Stop.

4039
03:53:10,520 --> 03:53:11,399
All right, but wait, wait, wait.

4040
03:53:11,399 --> 03:53:12,040
Here we go, here we go.

4041
03:53:14,649 --> 03:53:15,770
One more guava.

4042
03:53:15,770 --> 03:53:19,420
Let's see if we get wings.

4043
03:53:19,420 --> 03:53:21,379
I thought you retired that.

4044
03:53:24,229 --> 03:53:28,299
Holy shit.

4045
03:53:28,299 --> 03:53:30,299
I, wow, okay.

4046
03:53:30,299 --> 03:53:32,459
That would have been a fucking disaster.

4047
03:53:32,459 --> 03:53:36,379
That would have gotten all,

4048
03:53:36,379 --> 03:53:37,420
that would have dropped everywhere.

4049
03:53:37,420 --> 03:53:38,620
It would have gotten all over me.

4050
03:53:38,620 --> 03:53:46,950
All right, come on, wings.

4051
03:53:46,950 --> 03:53:48,309
I thought you retired that.

4052
03:53:48,870 --> 03:54:08,649
Pray for wings.

4053
03:54:08,649 --> 03:54:16,790
Wings, come on.

4054
03:54:16,790 --> 03:54:20,219
Yes, no.

4055
03:54:20,219 --> 03:54:21,340
All right, kind of cool though.

4056
03:54:21,340 --> 03:54:30,059
Looks really cool.

4057
03:54:30,059 --> 03:54:37,430
Probably the best looking dog we've had so far.

4058
03:54:37,430 --> 03:54:44,250
All right, now it's time to do some breeding.

4059
03:54:44,250 --> 03:54:45,049
And I'm going to sneeze.

4060
03:54:50,979 --> 03:55:19,290
I'm realizing how fucked up that was.

4061
03:55:19,290 --> 03:55:21,209
Why does tuba take the longest to do this?

4062
03:55:21,209 --> 03:55:29,739
How come I look purple?

4063
03:55:29,739 --> 03:55:31,659
I don't, dude, I don't know.

4064
03:55:31,659 --> 03:55:35,379
I don't, I have no idea why I look purple.

4065
03:55:35,379 --> 03:55:36,659
Your guess is as good as mine.

4066
03:55:36,659 --> 03:55:40,100
Are you kidding me?

4067
03:55:40,100 --> 03:55:41,219
There's a slide now.

4068
03:55:41,219 --> 03:55:54,280
Still shrinking.

4069
03:55:54,280 --> 03:55:57,770
Still shrinking by about 5% every time.

4070
03:55:59,399 --> 03:56:02,739
Okay, let's see what we get here.

4071
03:56:02,739 --> 03:56:20,059
This isn't breeding.

4072
03:56:20,059 --> 03:56:22,459
Lost a lot of leg gloss, which is weird.

4073
03:56:22,459 --> 03:56:25,540
All right, should I put the slide down?

4074
03:56:25,540 --> 03:56:27,299
All right, dude, what are you doing?

4075
03:56:27,299 --> 03:56:28,020
Relax.

4076
03:56:28,020 --> 03:56:31,100
Okay, let's breed.

4077
03:56:31,100 --> 03:56:32,280
Let's do it.

4078
03:56:33,479 --> 03:56:36,819
This is where it gets, it's going to be weird here.

4079
03:56:36,819 --> 03:56:47,340
Courage and tuba or should we do spud or John?

4080
03:56:47,340 --> 03:56:51,290
What would make the most interesting combination here?

4081
03:56:51,290 --> 03:57:02,309
All right, let's see if we get something crazy.

4082
03:57:02,309 --> 03:57:09,559
Interesting.

4083
03:57:09,559 --> 03:57:14,149
I'm thinking I like this one the most.

4084
03:57:14,149 --> 03:57:20,629
Look at this tiny little head and tiny little nose.

4085
03:57:20,629 --> 03:57:31,020
Yeah, wow.

4086
03:57:31,020 --> 03:57:33,260
All right, I love this one.

4087
03:57:33,260 --> 03:57:36,899
I can't say I love this one too.

4088
03:57:36,899 --> 03:57:44,790
Okay, I like these two.

4089
03:57:44,790 --> 03:57:48,620
Huge tail on this one and this one.

4090
03:57:48,620 --> 03:58:01,100
Another massive tail and this one here.

4091
03:58:01,100 --> 03:58:07,049
The tail just keeps getting longer.

4092
03:58:07,049 --> 03:58:08,569
I wonder if I should just take this one.

4093
03:58:08,569 --> 03:58:20,379
Oh god.

4094
03:58:20,379 --> 03:58:22,540
All right, we're at 89% stability.

4095
03:58:22,540 --> 03:58:35,579
Purple but doesn't have a huge tail.

4096
03:58:35,579 --> 03:58:42,040
This one has a massive tail and the purple one.

4097
03:58:42,040 --> 03:58:58,739
Maybe we get something in between.

4098
03:58:58,739 --> 03:58:59,879
There we go.

4099
03:58:59,879 --> 03:59:01,079
Rocko from Rocko's Modern Life.

4100
03:59:05,030 --> 03:59:06,309
I think I stay on this one.

4101
03:59:06,309 --> 03:59:11,450
Oh look, this one's got a Rudolph nose.

4102
03:59:12,090 --> 03:59:21,959
Do I dare try it one more time or should I combine Rudolph and Rocko?

4103
03:59:21,959 --> 03:59:39,739
Oh jeez, okay.

4104
03:59:40,379 --> 03:59:48,200
Again, do it again.

4105
03:59:52,979 --> 03:59:56,020
All right, the pool is getting a lot smaller.

4106
03:59:56,020 --> 03:59:58,360
Stop saying oh jeez.

4107
03:59:58,360 --> 03:59:59,239
Oh jeez.

4108
03:59:59,239 --> 04:00:00,680
Am I saying oh jeez a lot today?

4109
04:00:00,680 --> 04:00:01,319
Am I?

4110
04:00:01,319 --> 04:00:03,159
Am I saying oh jeez?

4111
04:00:03,959 --> 04:00:04,840
No, I'm not.

4112
04:00:04,840 --> 04:00:17,100
I don't know.

4113
04:00:17,100 --> 04:00:17,659
I'm not sure.

4114
04:00:18,540 --> 04:00:20,139
I think it's this one right here.

4115
04:00:20,139 --> 04:00:34,549
I like the red though.

4116
04:00:35,190 --> 04:00:41,799
I think this is best of both worlds here.

4117
04:00:43,239 --> 04:00:44,600
Yeah, this is the one.

4118
04:00:53,819 --> 04:00:55,420
That's best of both worlds.

4119
04:00:55,420 --> 04:01:08,020
All right, let's do it again.

4120
04:01:08,020 --> 04:01:11,719
This time we're going to do...

4121
04:01:13,739 --> 04:01:14,459
Who do we do now?

4122
04:01:18,790 --> 04:01:24,180
John Deere and Smush or John Deere and...

4123
04:01:24,180 --> 04:01:28,409
No, no, no, no, no.

4124
04:01:28,409 --> 04:01:29,370
John Deere and Curge.

4125
04:01:29,370 --> 04:01:36,139
What about Sherbert?

4126
04:01:36,139 --> 04:01:36,940
I feel like we're...

4127
04:01:36,940 --> 04:01:39,399
I think I like the blue.

4128
04:01:39,399 --> 04:01:45,459
Let's go for it.

4129
04:01:45,459 --> 04:01:47,579
What about Spud?

4130
04:01:47,579 --> 04:01:50,170
Where's Spud?

4131
04:01:52,219 --> 04:02:13,270
No, Spud is not doing so well.

4132
04:02:13,270 --> 04:02:13,989
Cool.

4133
04:02:13,989 --> 04:02:20,700
Maybe I wonder what...

4134
04:02:20,700 --> 04:02:21,260
Maybe we'll get a...

4135
04:02:26,979 --> 04:02:28,340
I think I don't want to do anything else.

4136
04:02:28,340 --> 04:02:29,459
This one looks like a squirrel.

4137
04:02:29,459 --> 04:02:30,260
I think I want the squirrel.

4138
04:03:05,500 --> 04:03:07,020
Oh, this one's fucking weird.

4139
04:03:07,020 --> 04:03:12,260
It's freaking me out.

4140
04:03:12,260 --> 04:03:13,299
Keep that one?

4141
04:03:13,299 --> 04:03:32,250
This one can't move.

4142
04:03:34,870 --> 04:03:36,709
Okay, so here comes...

4143
04:03:36,709 --> 04:03:39,959
How about as Rudolph?

4144
04:03:39,959 --> 04:03:52,899
Rutan is actually a pretty good name, yeah.

4145
04:03:52,899 --> 04:03:53,700
I like Rudolph.

4146
04:04:01,989 --> 04:04:03,030
All right, it's time to eat.

4147
04:04:03,030 --> 04:04:13,579
I still have another egg, don't I?

4148
04:04:13,579 --> 04:04:14,219
No, I don't.

4149
04:04:14,219 --> 04:04:14,780
Shit.

4150
04:04:14,780 --> 04:04:22,709
Why would you do this to animals?

4151
04:04:22,709 --> 04:04:24,979
Um, I don't know.

4152
04:04:24,979 --> 04:04:25,379
This is...

4153
04:04:25,379 --> 04:04:26,659
It's wobble dogs.

4154
04:04:26,659 --> 04:04:29,719
This is...

4155
04:04:29,719 --> 04:04:31,190
What do you mean?

4156
04:04:31,829 --> 04:04:32,870
Why did you do this?

4157
04:04:35,719 --> 04:04:37,959
Yeah, bro, it's a cartoon, all right?

4158
04:04:37,959 --> 04:04:39,079
It's a fucking cartoon.

4159
04:04:40,899 --> 04:04:42,180
All right, get rid of this.

4160
04:04:42,180 --> 04:04:44,409
Play with the ball.

4161
04:04:49,590 --> 04:04:51,430
Somebody just got sucked up.

4162
04:04:53,510 --> 04:04:55,590
Yo, bro, it's a cartoon, all right?

4163
04:04:59,219 --> 04:05:00,180
Anybody hungry?

4164
04:05:00,180 --> 04:05:03,719
All right, courage again.

4165
04:05:03,719 --> 04:05:05,860
I want you to eat these.

4166
04:05:05,860 --> 04:05:07,059
I want wings.

4167
04:05:07,059 --> 04:05:22,709
That's a bad defense.

4168
04:05:22,709 --> 04:05:36,260
They all have six legs.

4169
04:05:36,819 --> 04:05:37,219
I'm trying...

4170
04:05:37,219 --> 04:05:39,780
I want somebody with like nine or ten legs.

4171
04:05:39,780 --> 04:05:40,979
I want like a centipede.

4172
04:05:40,979 --> 04:05:43,290
What are you doing up here, Rudolph?

4173
04:05:43,290 --> 04:05:45,559
Paying your respects to the...

4174
04:05:45,559 --> 04:05:47,719
What a good boy.

4175
04:05:47,719 --> 04:05:50,340
Want to go sit in the chair?

4176
04:05:50,340 --> 04:05:54,200
You want to do some tricks?

4177
04:05:54,200 --> 04:05:57,590
Roll over.

4178
04:05:57,590 --> 04:05:58,950
Wow, so smart already.

4179
04:06:00,229 --> 04:06:01,510
Already so smart.

4180
04:06:01,510 --> 04:06:07,850
Do it again.

4181
04:06:07,850 --> 04:06:09,030
Speak.

4182
04:06:09,030 --> 04:06:11,620
Brilliant, dog.

4183
04:06:11,620 --> 04:06:16,569
Roll over.

4184
04:06:16,569 --> 04:06:21,930
Brilliant.

4185
04:06:21,930 --> 04:06:22,809
Good job.

4186
04:06:22,809 --> 04:06:27,590
Do it again.

4187
04:06:27,590 --> 04:06:32,790
You can do it.

4188
04:06:33,670 --> 04:06:34,469
Come on.

4189
04:06:34,469 --> 04:06:48,020
He's having a good time.

4190
04:06:48,020 --> 04:06:49,780
All right, I got a deviled egg.

4191
04:06:49,780 --> 04:06:58,950
Somebody eat a deviled egg.

4192
04:06:58,950 --> 04:07:09,290
What's happening over here?

4193
04:07:09,290 --> 04:07:12,139
Why do they have so much trouble getting food?

4194
04:07:12,139 --> 04:07:14,379
Here, have some deviled eggs, honey.

4195
04:07:14,379 --> 04:07:26,760
Why do they have so much trouble eating?

4196
04:07:26,760 --> 04:07:28,760
Like, what's going on?

4197
04:07:28,760 --> 04:07:29,319
Eat it.

4198
04:07:29,319 --> 04:07:36,139
Come on, eat the deviled egg.

4199
04:07:36,139 --> 04:07:46,809
Everybody have some deviled eggs.

4200
04:07:46,809 --> 04:07:49,299
Deviled eggs are fucking so gross.

4201
04:07:50,549 --> 04:07:54,739
But they're incredible when you want one.

4202
04:07:54,739 --> 04:08:02,379
Like, when you really, really want one,

4203
04:08:02,379 --> 04:08:06,739
it's like, holy shit, this is the greatest thing I've ever eaten my whole life.

4204
04:08:06,739 --> 04:08:08,819
Nine out of ten scenarios that the grossest fucking food

4205
04:08:08,819 --> 04:08:09,379
you could ever eat.

4206
04:08:11,190 --> 04:08:13,829
You need to eat a deviled egg right when it's made.

4207
04:08:13,829 --> 04:08:16,139
And not a second after that.

4208
04:08:16,139 --> 04:08:22,969
Not one second after.

4209
04:08:22,969 --> 04:08:27,959
If a deviled egg is even sitting out for five minutes,

4210
04:08:27,959 --> 04:08:29,159
I won't eat it.

4211
04:08:29,159 --> 04:08:29,659
I refuse.

4212
04:08:38,579 --> 04:08:41,450
Nope.

4213
04:08:41,450 --> 04:08:43,209
I feel the same way about hard-boiled eggs.

4214
04:08:45,290 --> 04:08:46,889
A fresh, hard-boiled egg,

4215
04:08:49,290 --> 04:08:50,889
you peel off the outer shell,

4216
04:08:52,090 --> 04:08:54,569
and it's just hot salt, pepper.

4217
04:08:55,209 --> 04:08:55,850
Eat it hot.

4218
04:08:57,219 --> 04:08:59,700
When you put hard-boiled eggs in the fridge in a container,

4219
04:09:02,059 --> 04:09:03,100
they stink.

4220
04:09:05,719 --> 04:09:07,559
All you hard-boiled egg lovers,

4221
04:09:07,559 --> 04:09:08,680
listen to me closely.

4222
04:09:09,620 --> 04:09:10,979
When you go to the fridge,

4223
04:09:10,979 --> 04:09:12,579
and you open up that container of hard-boiled eggs,

4224
04:09:12,579 --> 04:09:14,409
you take the container out,

4225
04:09:14,409 --> 04:09:17,079
everybody sits there and goes,

4226
04:09:17,079 --> 04:09:19,399
when I open this, it's going to be disgusting.

4227
04:09:20,709 --> 04:09:22,950
But one or two seconds after you take the lid off,

4228
04:09:23,829 --> 04:09:27,909
it stinks like fucking rotten eggs for ten seconds.

4229
04:09:27,909 --> 04:09:29,190
And then you go, okay, I'm fine.

4230
04:09:31,340 --> 04:09:33,340
It's like that every, it's just had that grow.

4231
04:09:33,340 --> 04:09:34,299
Oh my god, you're hungry.

4232
04:09:34,860 --> 04:09:39,559
What do you want?

4233
04:09:39,559 --> 04:09:40,440
What kind of food do you want?

4234
04:09:40,840 --> 04:09:48,360
A burrito, a hot deviled, no, no, no, no.

4235
04:09:50,180 --> 04:09:52,899
Deviled, if an egg is in a container for too long,

4236
04:09:52,899 --> 04:09:54,100
it smells awful.

4237
04:09:55,379 --> 04:09:56,180
Just eat them fresh.

4238
04:09:57,399 --> 04:09:58,600
When I used to lift all the time,

4239
04:09:59,690 --> 04:10:02,489
I would have like a dozen hard-boiled eggs in a container.

4240
04:10:02,489 --> 04:10:04,649
I don't know, I sound like a fucking old lady right now,

4241
04:10:04,649 --> 04:10:06,250
but bear with me, something's wrong with my throat.

4242
04:10:07,860 --> 04:10:13,340
When I was like 25, I would eat,

4243
04:10:13,340 --> 04:10:14,379
I would have a hard-boiled,

4244
04:10:14,379 --> 04:10:16,299
I would have like three hard-boiled eggs a day, four.

4245
04:10:17,879 --> 04:10:19,799
And it kind of hated it.

4246
04:10:19,799 --> 04:10:21,879
It was just like, oh, this like kind of smells it.

4247
04:10:22,950 --> 04:10:25,829
Even when they, not even a day goes by, one day.

4248
04:10:26,549 --> 04:10:28,520
You all know what I'm talking about,

4249
04:10:28,520 --> 04:10:29,479
you just refuse to believe it.

4250
04:10:31,620 --> 04:10:32,659
Ooh, new food.

4251
04:10:36,739 --> 04:10:38,260
I paused One Piece for this.

4252
04:10:38,899 --> 04:10:47,510
What are you, what, you're watching One Piece

4253
04:10:47,510 --> 04:10:49,829
and me at the same time?

4254
04:10:49,829 --> 04:10:55,239
I like Rudolph, Rudolph hangs out up here

4255
04:10:55,239 --> 04:10:58,780
and like pays like his respects to the other dogs.

4256
04:10:58,780 --> 04:11:06,440
What are you doing?

4257
04:11:06,440 --> 04:11:06,920
Look at him.

4258
04:11:14,579 --> 04:11:17,340
Oh, now that's so cute.

4259
04:11:24,840 --> 04:11:27,959
I'm telling you that I saw at least a few truths in the chat.

4260
04:11:29,530 --> 04:11:31,209
When you put hard-boiled eggs in the fridge

4261
04:11:31,209 --> 04:11:34,250
and a day or two later you open the container, it stinks.

4262
04:11:34,889 --> 04:11:38,809
I can't wait for you to make hard-boiled eggs,

4263
04:11:38,809 --> 04:11:40,409
put it in the fridge and you're going to take out the container.

4264
04:11:40,409 --> 04:11:42,170
You're going to hear what I said in your head

4265
04:11:42,170 --> 04:11:43,129
and you're going to go like this

4266
04:11:44,010 --> 04:11:45,610
and one or two seconds is going to go by

4267
04:11:45,610 --> 04:11:48,409
and you're going to go, and piece of shit was right.

4268
04:11:58,899 --> 04:11:59,459
I'm so happy.

4269
04:12:00,340 --> 04:12:04,250
All right, eat these wings.

4270
04:12:09,049 --> 04:12:10,979
You are literally never right about anything.

4271
04:12:13,670 --> 04:12:16,840
You don't even know what you're talking about.

4272
04:12:16,840 --> 04:12:18,200
You don't even know what you're talking about.

4273
04:12:25,540 --> 04:12:27,940
He is never right.

4274
04:12:29,579 --> 04:12:30,700
I can do this today.

4275
04:12:31,340 --> 04:12:32,379
Listen to this.

4276
04:12:32,379 --> 04:12:34,459
Wow, I got a good one here today.

4277
04:12:35,799 --> 04:12:40,180
This is not taking very much effort at all for me to do this, by the way.

4278
04:12:40,180 --> 04:12:44,420
I am just barely gently slowly doing this and I'm not even trying.

4279
04:12:47,500 --> 04:12:49,420
Am I really going to be like this for the rest of my life?

4280
04:12:55,000 --> 04:12:56,440
TikTok uncle voice.

4281
04:12:57,479 --> 04:13:00,780
Give me something to say.

4282
04:13:00,780 --> 04:13:02,700
Give me something to say in the TikTok voice.

4283
04:13:03,959 --> 04:13:04,760
Give me something to say.

4284
04:13:05,319 --> 04:13:06,819
What should I say?

4285
04:13:06,819 --> 04:13:08,020
TikTok TTS.

4286
04:13:14,649 --> 04:13:16,090
It's the TikTok voice.

4287
04:13:17,450 --> 04:13:19,129
It's not taking very much to do that.

4288
04:13:24,260 --> 04:13:25,700
Say it's the globalists.

4289
04:13:25,700 --> 04:13:30,649
No, the globalists.

4290
04:13:30,649 --> 04:13:31,610
TikTok voice.

4291
04:13:32,170 --> 04:13:33,129
I fucking can't.

4292
04:13:35,940 --> 04:13:37,379
Just got back from Coachella.

4293
04:13:37,940 --> 04:13:39,459
Had an insanely good time.

4294
04:13:42,309 --> 04:13:43,670
Here's some pics from the event.

4295
04:13:44,229 --> 04:13:50,500
Oh, look at all these toys.

4296
04:13:55,340 --> 04:13:56,780
Just got back from Coachella.

4297
04:13:57,340 --> 04:14:03,190
It was absolutely busting.

4298
04:14:03,190 --> 04:14:10,870
Ooh, you're doing the TikTok of Rocket voice.

4299
04:14:10,870 --> 04:14:18,520
I don't know what's going on with my throat.

4300
04:14:18,520 --> 04:14:19,639
I seriously have no idea.

4301
04:14:26,069 --> 04:14:28,950
Oh, it's time to mutate.

4302
04:14:28,950 --> 04:14:36,409
I was going to scream, but I was like, I don't want to hurt my voice.

4303
04:14:36,409 --> 04:14:45,299
That's actually the worst joke.

4304
04:14:45,299 --> 04:14:47,620
I don't know.

4305
04:14:47,620 --> 04:14:50,489
He's dancing to the music.

4306
04:14:50,489 --> 04:14:52,950
Yeah, I went like this and I was going to scream and I said,

4307
04:14:52,950 --> 04:14:54,549
I kind of braced my eyes for the scream.

4308
04:14:54,549 --> 04:14:56,229
But then I was like, mutate.

4309
04:14:56,229 --> 04:14:59,459
Nah, I gave up.

4310
04:14:59,459 --> 04:15:00,500
Didn't want to do that.

4311
04:15:00,500 --> 04:15:03,059
Didn't want to scream really loud into the mic.

4312
04:15:03,059 --> 04:15:14,059
Do Voldemort noises.

4313
04:15:18,979 --> 04:15:19,379
What are we going to get?

4314
04:15:19,379 --> 04:15:20,020
Come on, Rudolph.

4315
04:15:20,020 --> 04:15:20,659
Give us something cool.

4316
04:15:21,219 --> 04:15:35,879
The reds got redder.

4317
04:15:35,879 --> 04:15:37,639
The brights got brighter.

4318
04:15:37,639 --> 04:15:44,709
Got bigger legs.

4319
04:15:44,709 --> 04:15:46,069
No, the tail went down.

4320
04:15:46,069 --> 04:16:03,399
It's all right.

4321
04:16:03,399 --> 04:16:05,159
I love how they rock out to this music.

4322
04:16:05,159 --> 04:16:06,040
It's so cool.

4323
04:16:06,040 --> 04:16:07,350
It's so funny.

4324
04:16:07,350 --> 04:16:12,100
They're just having so much fun.

4325
04:16:15,209 --> 04:16:15,690
Good job.

4326
04:16:16,250 --> 04:16:17,690
That was very good dancing.

4327
04:16:17,690 --> 04:16:26,549
Very, very good.

4328
04:16:26,549 --> 04:16:27,350
Very good job.

4329
04:16:27,350 --> 04:16:29,670
Except you peed your pants.

4330
04:16:29,670 --> 04:16:30,889
What is it?

4331
04:16:30,889 --> 04:16:31,770
What is it, boy?

4332
04:16:31,770 --> 04:16:40,680
What is it?

4333
04:16:40,680 --> 04:16:41,399
Good job.

4334
04:16:41,399 --> 04:16:47,129
All right.

4335
04:16:47,129 --> 04:16:48,170
Stop shaking around so much.

4336
04:16:48,170 --> 04:16:51,180
I can't see.

4337
04:16:51,180 --> 04:16:52,139
New creature egg.

4338
04:16:55,139 --> 04:16:57,350
Somebody's hungry.

4339
04:16:57,750 --> 04:16:59,270
I forgot Tuba was still alive.

4340
04:16:59,270 --> 04:17:00,229
I thought Tuba was dead.

4341
04:17:00,790 --> 04:17:08,180
Okay.

4342
04:17:08,180 --> 04:17:08,500
Let's see.

4343
04:17:08,500 --> 04:17:08,979
What do we get?

4344
04:17:10,950 --> 04:17:18,090
How about Spud and Courage?

4345
04:17:18,090 --> 04:17:18,569
No.

4346
04:17:18,569 --> 04:17:20,409
We have too much courage.

4347
04:17:20,409 --> 04:17:21,770
We're going to end up having Courage B

4348
04:17:22,409 --> 04:17:25,959
in every single piece of lineage, right?

4349
04:17:25,959 --> 04:17:27,079
Tuba and Spud.

4350
04:17:27,079 --> 04:17:35,540
Let's go.

4351
04:17:35,540 --> 04:17:36,260
Ooh.

4352
04:17:36,260 --> 04:17:43,879
I like this one and this one.

4353
04:17:43,879 --> 04:17:44,520
Mutate them.

4354
04:17:45,079 --> 04:17:49,899
That looks like a cat.

4355
04:17:49,899 --> 04:18:02,149
Let's take this to zero.

4356
04:18:02,149 --> 04:18:06,969
Let's take it to zero.

4357
04:18:24,340 --> 04:18:24,979
Ooh.

4358
04:18:24,979 --> 04:18:28,979
We've got a mutation.

4359
04:18:28,979 --> 04:18:36,090
Another mutation.

4360
04:18:36,090 --> 04:18:49,159
Another mutation.

4361
04:18:49,159 --> 04:18:55,770
Oh, yeah.

4362
04:18:55,770 --> 04:18:57,079
Perfect.

4363
04:18:57,079 --> 04:18:59,139
Looks good.

4364
04:18:59,139 --> 04:19:00,020
Let's do it again.

4365
04:19:00,020 --> 04:19:16,229
Oh, the pool is kind of shrinking a little.

4366
04:19:16,229 --> 04:19:18,100
It's kind of like Snoopy.

4367
04:19:18,100 --> 04:19:27,959
I think this is it.

4368
04:19:30,569 --> 04:19:31,610
I think it's this one right here.

4369
04:19:31,610 --> 04:19:34,040
Snoopy.

4370
04:19:34,040 --> 04:19:35,159
Worst joke 2022.

4371
04:19:35,159 --> 04:19:52,489
Jerma says Bussin'.

4372
04:19:52,489 --> 04:19:53,209
Ooh.

4373
04:19:53,209 --> 04:19:53,530
All right.

4374
04:19:53,530 --> 04:19:53,930
I think we...

4375
04:19:53,930 --> 04:19:54,489
I don't know.

4376
04:19:54,489 --> 04:19:55,850
I think it's this one here in the middle.

4377
04:19:55,850 --> 04:19:58,500
This looks the healthiest.

4378
04:19:58,500 --> 04:19:59,139
That's the one.

4379
04:19:59,139 --> 04:20:08,219
Oh, I said Bussin'.

4380
04:20:08,219 --> 04:20:12,979
Were you here the other day when I said...

4381
04:20:12,979 --> 04:20:14,100
What did I say the other day?

4382
04:20:14,100 --> 04:20:16,149
I said something the other day.

4383
04:20:16,149 --> 04:20:16,870
What was it?

4384
04:20:16,870 --> 04:20:17,989
Oh, yeah.

4385
04:20:17,989 --> 04:20:19,110
I said like sheesh.

4386
04:20:19,110 --> 04:20:19,430
I said...

4387
04:20:19,430 --> 04:20:20,709
I was like, oh, sheesh.

4388
04:20:20,709 --> 04:20:37,139
Yeah, you're all right.

4389
04:20:41,110 --> 04:20:45,180
I am now not allowed to say those things.

4390
04:20:45,180 --> 04:20:45,979
When I say...

4391
04:20:45,979 --> 04:20:46,299
Okay.

4392
04:20:46,299 --> 04:20:48,139
If let's say the dog were to go like this.

4393
04:20:48,780 --> 04:20:49,260
Whoa.

4394
04:20:49,260 --> 04:20:50,620
That dog was Bussin'.

4395
04:20:50,620 --> 04:20:51,659
People would be like...

4396
04:20:51,659 --> 04:20:53,420
Shut up, you fucking old loser.

4397
04:20:53,420 --> 04:20:55,579
I'm at the age where like I can't do that now.

4398
04:20:55,579 --> 04:20:56,620
Because people yell at me.

4399
04:20:57,989 --> 04:20:59,190
People say that...

4400
04:20:59,190 --> 04:20:59,909
We don't say that.

4401
04:21:00,469 --> 04:21:06,489
If I were to say like Bussin' or like sheesh or like...

4402
04:21:07,290 --> 04:21:07,930
Oh, dude.

4403
04:21:07,930 --> 04:21:08,809
No cap, right?

4404
04:21:08,809 --> 04:21:12,760
People would be like, I fucking hate this guy, right?

4405
04:21:18,500 --> 04:21:19,459
Don't even tell me.

4406
04:21:20,979 --> 04:21:21,780
Don't even tell me.

4407
04:21:23,020 --> 04:21:23,979
If I were to...

4408
04:21:23,979 --> 04:21:24,540
Let's try it.

4409
04:21:25,620 --> 04:21:31,290
I want the mods to count the amount of like minus twos, ha-has.

4410
04:21:32,170 --> 04:21:34,200
I'm not going to tell you when I'm going to do it.

4411
04:21:34,200 --> 04:21:35,159
I want these mods...

4412
04:21:35,719 --> 04:21:36,120
Count it.

4413
04:21:36,120 --> 04:21:38,360
Count how many times people say something negative about it.

4414
04:21:39,319 --> 04:21:39,719
Just watch.

4415
04:21:40,280 --> 04:21:41,659
Let's check it out.

4416
04:21:41,659 --> 04:21:42,059
You'll see.

4417
04:21:44,409 --> 04:21:47,290
I'm going to use it in such a great context.

4418
04:21:47,290 --> 04:21:48,489
I'm just going to say it's going to be perfect.

4419
04:21:50,340 --> 04:21:51,540
Where's the egg machine?

4420
04:21:54,120 --> 04:21:54,760
Oh, my goodness.

4421
04:21:54,760 --> 04:21:55,639
I forgot about this guy.

4422
04:21:56,280 --> 04:21:58,500
How about like teeny?

4423
04:21:59,139 --> 04:22:00,860
Like teeny tiny?

4424
04:22:00,860 --> 04:22:01,420
How about like...

4425
04:22:02,059 --> 04:22:02,860
I like teeny...

4426
04:22:02,860 --> 04:22:03,180
Look what?

4427
04:22:03,180 --> 04:22:03,899
Like teeny?

4428
04:22:06,090 --> 04:22:07,450
I'm not even going to do it today either.

4429
04:22:07,450 --> 04:22:09,530
I'm going to hold on to this for like a few days at least.

4430
04:22:10,170 --> 04:22:16,860
Tipsy?

4431
04:22:18,549 --> 04:22:19,270
Tipsy's fine.

4432
04:22:19,829 --> 04:22:20,950
Oh, look at little Tipsy.

4433
04:22:21,590 --> 04:22:38,340
Go in the house, Tipsy.

4434
04:22:38,979 --> 04:22:44,459
Are you going to eat that or...

4435
04:22:44,459 --> 04:22:44,860
Okay, fine.

4436
04:22:44,860 --> 04:22:45,659
Eat it.

4437
04:22:45,659 --> 04:22:46,700
I want you to get wings.

4438
04:22:46,700 --> 04:22:47,579
That'd be cool.

4439
04:22:47,579 --> 04:22:52,739
Should have named him Grafted Scion.

4440
04:22:52,739 --> 04:22:55,219
That's pretty good.

4441
04:22:55,780 --> 04:22:57,239
All right.

4442
04:22:57,239 --> 04:22:57,719
People...

4443
04:22:57,719 --> 04:22:58,760
Who wants to have fun in here?

4444
04:22:58,760 --> 04:22:59,719
Somebody's not having fun.

4445
04:23:00,790 --> 04:23:02,309
John is not having a good time.

4446
04:23:02,950 --> 04:23:07,159
Why don't you play?

4447
04:23:08,409 --> 04:23:09,290
Yeah, like go play.

4448
04:23:09,930 --> 04:23:13,139
Oh, my God.

4449
04:23:13,139 --> 04:23:14,659
Spud is like suffering again.

4450
04:23:15,299 --> 04:23:16,979
Sweetheart, I'll have another devil egg.

4451
04:23:17,540 --> 04:23:32,200
Something healthier, please.

4452
04:23:32,200 --> 04:23:33,799
Like a nutrition pellet.

4453
04:23:33,799 --> 04:23:38,090
Is it me or is Spud always having a problem, right?

4454
04:23:39,979 --> 04:23:40,780
I wonder why.

4455
04:23:40,780 --> 04:23:43,739
Why is Spud just not ever having a good time?

4456
04:23:43,739 --> 04:23:44,239
Ever.

4457
04:23:52,420 --> 04:23:53,940
Spud doesn't like to go to sleep.

4458
04:23:54,500 --> 04:23:55,459
I think that's what's going on.

4459
04:23:55,459 --> 04:23:56,420
Spud doesn't like to go to bed.

4460
04:24:00,409 --> 04:24:04,819
I come up here and Spud is in red for his sleep every time.

4461
04:24:05,540 --> 04:24:25,319
I liked over at the mod chat that I have in my Discord.

4462
04:24:26,280 --> 04:24:27,559
And I see LOL.

4463
04:24:27,559 --> 04:24:28,840
We're not going to do that.

4464
04:24:29,479 --> 04:24:42,040
All right.

4465
04:24:42,040 --> 04:24:42,520
We don't have...

4466
04:24:43,479 --> 04:24:44,440
I refuse.

4467
04:24:44,440 --> 04:24:44,840
Okay.

4468
04:24:44,840 --> 04:24:45,159
All right.

4469
04:24:45,159 --> 04:24:46,040
We don't have to do that.

4470
04:24:46,760 --> 04:24:51,270
We don't have to do that.

4471
04:24:51,270 --> 04:24:53,829
Somebody said there were at least two when you said it.

4472
04:24:53,829 --> 04:24:54,309
Okay.

4473
04:24:54,309 --> 04:24:54,629
All right.

4474
04:24:58,629 --> 04:24:59,670
Thankfully, it's clean.

4475
04:25:08,520 --> 04:25:09,819
Look at...

4476
04:25:09,819 --> 04:25:11,020
Oh, can he not even eat?

4477
04:25:15,340 --> 04:25:19,559
This was your guy's idea.

4478
04:25:19,559 --> 04:25:20,680
I didn't want to do this.

4479
04:25:20,680 --> 04:25:22,709
This was your idea.

4480
04:25:22,709 --> 04:25:23,510
I didn't want to do this.

4481
04:25:23,510 --> 04:25:23,909
I'm sorry.

4482
04:25:23,909 --> 04:25:24,469
I didn't want to do this.

4483
04:25:24,469 --> 04:25:27,159
You did it.

4484
04:25:27,159 --> 04:25:28,840
I don't think he can even eat food.

4485
04:25:28,840 --> 04:25:30,149
Look what you did.

4486
04:25:30,149 --> 04:25:30,709
I didn't do this.

4487
04:25:32,469 --> 04:25:33,590
I wanted to do it another time.

4488
04:25:45,340 --> 04:25:46,780
Maybe I can feed?

4489
04:25:46,780 --> 04:25:47,500
Can I feed you?

4490
04:25:47,500 --> 04:25:50,040
Like, go on.

4491
04:25:50,040 --> 04:25:50,760
Eat it.

4492
04:25:50,760 --> 04:25:51,079
Okay.

4493
04:25:52,469 --> 04:25:52,709
All right.

4494
04:25:52,709 --> 04:25:53,110
No, no, no.

4495
04:25:53,110 --> 04:25:53,510
It was fine.

4496
04:25:53,510 --> 04:25:55,030
I think I just have to tell him to eat.

4497
04:25:55,590 --> 04:25:58,700
What are you doing over here?

4498
04:25:58,700 --> 04:25:59,180
Smush.

4499
04:25:59,180 --> 04:26:11,079
Leave him alone.

4500
04:26:11,079 --> 04:26:11,799
Oh, they're like...

4501
04:26:11,799 --> 04:26:13,399
He's bumping his nose.

4502
04:26:13,399 --> 04:26:30,229
I think he's trying to make a friend.

4503
04:26:30,229 --> 04:26:30,950
Give Tipsy.

4504
04:26:32,950 --> 04:26:34,149
Tipsy's fine.

4505
04:26:34,149 --> 04:26:39,159
That was very nice of you, Smush.

4506
04:26:39,159 --> 04:26:41,639
Tipsy is a baby and you were very gentle.

4507
04:26:41,639 --> 04:26:42,680
And so that was very good.

4508
04:26:42,680 --> 04:26:43,959
That was very kind of you.

4509
04:26:43,959 --> 04:26:48,950
How's everybody doing?

4510
04:26:48,950 --> 04:26:49,750
Tipsy's okay.

4511
04:26:50,309 --> 04:26:51,430
Tipsy, you should just go to sleep.

4512
04:26:51,989 --> 04:26:57,479
Spud?

4513
04:26:57,479 --> 04:26:58,040
Looking for food?

4514
04:26:58,040 --> 04:26:58,760
What do you need?

4515
04:26:58,760 --> 04:26:59,639
What do you need, bud?

4516
04:26:59,639 --> 04:27:05,049
Sitting over by here.

4517
04:27:05,049 --> 04:27:06,409
How about a dehydrated treat?

4518
04:27:06,409 --> 04:27:09,110
How you doing?

4519
04:27:09,110 --> 04:27:09,270
Okay.

4520
04:27:09,270 --> 04:27:09,909
Well, you have to get out of the way.

4521
04:27:09,909 --> 04:27:10,870
I can't press the button.

4522
04:27:10,870 --> 04:27:19,139
Oh, god damn it.

4523
04:27:19,139 --> 04:27:19,780
Whatever.

4524
04:27:19,780 --> 04:27:24,329
Oh, Spud's getting old.

4525
04:27:24,329 --> 04:27:24,729
Okay.

4526
04:27:24,729 --> 04:27:25,850
Spud's getting old?

4527
04:27:25,850 --> 04:27:32,709
Okay, have a snack.

4528
04:27:32,709 --> 04:27:36,329
What the hell was that?

4529
04:27:37,639 --> 04:27:37,879
Okay.

4530
04:27:38,809 --> 04:27:40,090
Tipsy is about to mutate.

4531
04:27:40,090 --> 04:27:41,290
But I want to feed Tipsy.

4532
04:27:41,290 --> 04:27:41,530
What's...

4533
04:27:41,530 --> 04:27:42,809
I need something that looks like leg strength.

4534
04:27:44,739 --> 04:27:47,030
What do I feed for leg strength?

4535
04:27:47,030 --> 04:28:02,459
What have you done to Tipsy?

4536
04:28:02,459 --> 04:28:03,260
I didn't do anything.

4537
04:28:06,040 --> 04:28:10,809
Turn on the gravity machine?

4538
04:28:10,809 --> 04:28:11,290
All right, Tipsy.

4539
04:28:11,290 --> 04:28:12,329
Let's just pupate.

4540
04:28:12,329 --> 04:28:13,450
We'll just get it over with.

4541
04:28:13,450 --> 04:28:26,520
This game sucks.

4542
04:28:26,520 --> 04:28:27,239
It's so sad.

4543
04:28:28,409 --> 04:28:29,129
What do you mean it's sad?

4544
04:28:30,409 --> 04:28:31,209
Look at this room.

4545
04:28:31,209 --> 04:28:32,329
Look at how these guys have been

4546
04:28:32,329 --> 04:28:33,450
having a ball up here the whole time.

4547
04:28:36,940 --> 04:28:38,420
Look.

4548
04:28:38,420 --> 04:28:39,139
Is this sad?

4549
04:28:39,139 --> 04:28:40,180
This is great.

4550
04:28:40,739 --> 04:28:41,620
They're having a good time.

4551
04:28:41,620 --> 04:28:42,500
They've been playing.

4552
04:28:42,500 --> 04:28:43,540
These lay love to play.

4553
04:28:44,100 --> 04:28:45,270
They're very polite.

4554
04:28:45,829 --> 04:28:50,149
I mean, he's a little rude, but it's okay.

4555
04:28:50,149 --> 04:28:50,950
Food-averse?

4556
04:28:51,590 --> 04:28:52,229
That's all right.

4557
04:28:53,270 --> 04:28:57,719
They've just been up here headbanging.

4558
04:28:57,719 --> 04:29:05,270
I'm definitely putting that up here.

4559
04:29:05,909 --> 04:29:10,139
Oh, hell yeah.

4560
04:29:10,139 --> 04:29:10,379
Yep.

4561
04:29:11,180 --> 04:29:11,819
That's good shit.

4562
04:29:16,700 --> 04:29:17,420
All right, Tipsy, come on.

4563
04:29:17,420 --> 04:29:18,459
You got to have stronger legs.

4564
04:29:29,510 --> 04:29:29,909
All right.

4565
04:29:29,909 --> 04:29:31,829
Front legs got a little thicker.

4566
04:29:31,829 --> 04:29:42,200
The body shrink and legs got longer.

4567
04:29:42,920 --> 04:29:49,780
But oh my God.

4568
04:29:59,559 --> 04:29:59,879
Okay.

4569
04:30:04,250 --> 04:30:05,530
I think somebody needs to eat Tipsy.

4570
04:30:06,729 --> 04:30:10,819
All right, you're good to go.

4571
04:30:10,819 --> 04:30:11,940
You've been rocking out this whole time.

4572
04:30:11,940 --> 04:30:13,459
How about a guava?

4573
04:30:13,459 --> 04:30:15,979
Here, have some food first.

4574
04:30:15,979 --> 04:30:18,620
I think Rudolph might be the best dog

4575
04:30:18,620 --> 04:30:19,819
we have besides courage.

4576
04:30:22,020 --> 04:30:23,459
We have to decide who's going to eat Tipsy.

4577
04:30:26,059 --> 04:30:27,180
That's the big issue here.

4578
04:30:32,200 --> 04:30:33,000
I really want wings.

4579
04:30:33,000 --> 04:30:34,440
All right, I'll try the gravity machine

4580
04:30:34,440 --> 04:30:35,879
in like the playroom or something like down here.

4581
04:30:42,340 --> 04:30:44,420
Dog stack, gravity machine.

4582
04:30:45,139 --> 04:30:46,260
Oh, this is the new food.

4583
04:30:46,260 --> 04:30:46,420
Right.

4584
04:30:46,420 --> 04:30:47,540
I wanted to see what was in here.

4585
04:30:55,219 --> 04:30:55,540
Moon.

4586
04:31:07,670 --> 04:31:08,950
Should I put this in a room with Tipsy

4587
04:31:08,950 --> 04:31:14,180
so Tipsy can like actually move?

4588
04:31:14,180 --> 04:31:14,659
Mars?

4589
04:31:17,719 --> 04:31:23,020
Oh, back to earth.

4590
04:31:23,020 --> 04:31:24,700
Oh, that looked like it hurt.

4591
04:31:24,700 --> 04:31:42,489
Get that fucking thing out of here.

4592
04:31:42,489 --> 04:31:43,450
All right, new food.

4593
04:31:43,450 --> 04:31:46,569
Pancakes, garlic bread, chips, lasagna.

4594
04:31:46,569 --> 04:31:47,530
All right, lasagna.

4595
04:31:47,530 --> 04:31:48,489
Who wants a lasagna?

4596
04:31:48,489 --> 04:31:51,059
This thing's got to move.

4597
04:31:52,180 --> 04:31:54,229
I need to hold on.

4598
04:31:54,229 --> 04:31:54,950
My shoulder hurts.

4599
04:31:54,950 --> 04:31:55,350
Okay.

4600
04:31:55,350 --> 04:32:14,950
All right, let's start serving up some pancakes and shit.

4601
04:32:14,950 --> 04:32:16,549
All right, look at these new DNA strands.

4602
04:32:16,549 --> 04:32:22,120
I'm just going to start throwing them down there.

4603
04:32:22,120 --> 04:32:23,219
They'll eat them eventually.

4604
04:32:23,219 --> 04:32:25,899
They'll figure it out.

4605
04:32:25,899 --> 04:32:27,500
Pancakes, garlic bread.

4606
04:32:27,500 --> 04:32:32,200
Food's coming.

4607
04:32:32,200 --> 04:32:40,069
Doritos or something.

4608
04:32:40,069 --> 04:32:50,860
A few lasagnas down there.

4609
04:32:50,860 --> 04:32:59,879
Wait.

4610
04:32:59,879 --> 04:33:10,439
Spud has lived a long life.

4611
04:33:10,439 --> 04:33:11,000
Oh, no.

4612
04:33:11,000 --> 04:33:13,080
Spud.

4613
04:33:13,080 --> 04:33:14,119
Oh, Spud.

4614
04:33:14,119 --> 04:33:15,319
Spud's dead.

4615
04:33:15,319 --> 04:33:18,139
Oh, no.

4616
04:33:18,139 --> 04:33:25,779
It's okay, Spud.

4617
04:33:25,779 --> 04:33:26,979
No, it's all right.

4618
04:33:26,979 --> 04:33:29,830
Where's courage?

4619
04:33:29,830 --> 04:33:31,740
Courage, you need to eat that.

4620
04:33:31,740 --> 04:33:38,380
Tipsy made it up here.

4621
04:33:38,380 --> 04:33:41,209
No, you don't touch that too, but get out of here.

4622
04:33:41,209 --> 04:33:41,849
No, smush.

4623
04:33:41,849 --> 04:33:42,810
Don't touch that.

4624
04:33:43,209 --> 04:33:49,540
What happened in there?

4625
04:33:50,099 --> 04:33:51,319
I need somebody.

4626
04:33:51,319 --> 04:33:51,880
I need...

4627
04:33:51,880 --> 04:33:52,759
Where's courage?

4628
04:33:52,759 --> 04:33:57,349
Courage, come on out.

4629
04:33:57,349 --> 04:34:00,040
End table.

4630
04:34:00,040 --> 04:34:00,919
Large tube.

4631
04:34:00,919 --> 04:34:09,159
It's a piece of tofu.

4632
04:34:09,159 --> 04:34:10,200
Don't eat poop.

4633
04:34:10,200 --> 04:34:14,330
Do I...

4634
04:34:14,330 --> 04:34:15,209
Oh, my God.

4635
04:34:15,209 --> 04:34:17,459
No, Rudolph should eat it.

4636
04:34:17,459 --> 04:34:18,099
Rudolph should eat it.

4637
04:34:18,099 --> 04:34:27,240
He's my favorite.

4638
04:34:27,240 --> 04:34:27,880
All right.

4639
04:34:27,880 --> 04:34:32,299
Your name being Rudolph doesn't really make any sense anymore.

4640
04:34:32,299 --> 04:34:33,750
That's okay, though.

4641
04:34:33,750 --> 04:34:42,939
Tuba, get the fuck out of here.

4642
04:34:42,939 --> 04:34:43,500
Tuba's not...

4643
04:34:43,500 --> 04:34:44,540
You're not supposed to be doing that.

4644
04:34:44,540 --> 04:34:45,900
Eat the pizza and garlic bread and stuff.

4645
04:34:45,900 --> 04:34:48,650
Whatever.

4646
04:34:48,650 --> 04:34:49,209
You eat that.

4647
04:34:49,209 --> 04:34:52,090
I swear to God.

4648
04:34:52,090 --> 04:34:53,209
Don't touch that.

4649
04:34:53,209 --> 04:34:57,270
Who do I want to eat the orb?

4650
04:35:02,259 --> 04:35:04,180
Do I want Rudolph or do I want courage?

4651
04:35:04,180 --> 04:35:19,770
Give it a tipsy.

4652
04:35:19,770 --> 04:35:21,049
No, I don't need a memorial.

4653
04:35:21,049 --> 04:35:25,849
I'm going to feed it to tipsy.

4654
04:35:25,849 --> 04:35:26,650
Why would I do that?

4655
04:35:26,650 --> 04:35:28,889
That's the fucking dumbest idea we've had all day.

4656
04:35:28,889 --> 04:35:37,020
I don't even know where tipsy is.

4657
04:35:45,240 --> 04:35:46,279
I'm not feeding.

4658
04:35:47,700 --> 04:35:48,180
Oh, no.

4659
04:35:48,180 --> 04:35:49,299
Smush is old.

4660
04:35:49,299 --> 04:36:24,700
We're going to get tipsy big and strong here.

4661
04:36:32,259 --> 04:36:36,860
I'm looking for leg strength.

4662
04:36:36,860 --> 04:36:37,419
Thick legs.

4663
04:36:37,419 --> 04:36:37,659
All right.

4664
04:36:37,659 --> 04:36:39,259
We need deviled eggs.

4665
04:36:39,259 --> 04:36:42,040
Oh, sweet.

4666
04:36:42,040 --> 04:36:42,599
It's so sweet.

4667
04:36:42,599 --> 04:36:53,380
I have some deviled eggs.

4668
04:36:53,380 --> 04:37:04,330
Long body.

4669
04:37:04,330 --> 04:37:06,169
And this increases growth, too.

4670
04:37:06,169 --> 04:37:07,130
This means big.

4671
04:37:07,130 --> 04:37:09,849
Can you eat that tooth, too?

4672
04:37:09,849 --> 04:37:19,099
I hope you'll eat it.

4673
04:37:19,099 --> 04:37:19,659
All right.

4674
04:37:19,659 --> 04:37:21,819
I'm ready for tipsy to do a little evolution here.

4675
04:37:21,819 --> 04:37:26,279
Get some sleep.

4676
04:37:26,279 --> 04:37:28,840
And we'll see if we can get you a little bit stronger.

4677
04:37:28,840 --> 04:37:35,049
Get out of here.

4678
04:37:35,049 --> 04:37:35,849
It's a menace.

4679
04:37:35,849 --> 04:37:43,220
That tube is a menace.

4680
04:37:43,220 --> 04:37:49,180
Kind of funny, but it causes problems a lot, I think.

4681
04:37:49,979 --> 04:37:55,560
You're fine up here.

4682
04:37:55,560 --> 04:37:55,799
All right.

4683
04:37:55,799 --> 04:37:56,520
Who else is there?

4684
04:37:57,159 --> 04:37:59,500
Don, you need to sleep.

4685
04:37:59,500 --> 04:38:04,540
Smush is...

4686
04:38:05,340 --> 04:38:06,380
Let me play with you for a second.

4687
04:38:06,380 --> 04:38:07,259
Come here.

4688
04:38:07,259 --> 04:38:19,799
I'm drying him off.

4689
04:38:19,799 --> 04:38:21,659
He's covered in water.

4690
04:38:21,659 --> 04:38:25,060
Don's getting old.

4691
04:38:25,060 --> 04:38:25,560
Uh-oh.

4692
04:38:29,560 --> 04:38:30,599
Oh, shit.

4693
04:38:30,599 --> 04:38:32,040
I completely forgot about Snoopy.

4694
04:38:38,840 --> 04:38:39,560
Charge is fine.

4695
04:38:40,279 --> 04:38:47,419
The positive reinforcement cap for any property.

4696
04:38:47,419 --> 04:38:49,500
Proto?

4697
04:38:49,500 --> 04:38:52,729
What is that?

4698
04:38:53,529 --> 04:38:55,669
Who's Proto?

4699
04:39:05,750 --> 04:39:06,549
Whoa.

4700
04:39:06,549 --> 04:39:08,619
I got spots.

4701
04:39:09,340 --> 04:39:12,520
Okay.

4702
04:39:13,479 --> 04:39:13,959
Interesting.

4703
04:39:14,680 --> 04:39:17,159
All right.

4704
04:39:17,159 --> 04:39:17,639
John, eat.

4705
04:39:18,680 --> 04:39:20,200
Eat like some lasagna or something.

4706
04:39:20,200 --> 04:39:21,000
Yeah, eat a lasagna.

4707
04:39:21,720 --> 04:39:26,150
There you go.

4708
04:39:26,150 --> 04:39:26,950
Good.

4709
04:39:26,950 --> 04:39:28,729
Eat a lasagna.

4710
04:39:28,729 --> 04:39:29,770
Eat like a pancake.

4711
04:39:29,770 --> 04:39:30,409
I just want...

4712
04:39:30,409 --> 04:39:31,369
I want you to mutate.

4713
04:39:32,330 --> 04:39:33,290
Aren't you going to die, though?

4714
04:39:33,930 --> 04:39:35,220
Who has not mutated?

4715
04:39:35,220 --> 04:39:35,700
Okay.

4716
04:39:35,700 --> 04:39:37,779
Actually, you come up here and eat like a pancake or something.

4717
04:39:38,419 --> 04:39:44,380
Adult?

4718
04:39:45,939 --> 04:39:46,259
Okay.

4719
04:39:46,259 --> 04:39:46,659
Tipsy.

4720
04:39:47,220 --> 04:39:54,619
I got you.

4721
04:39:54,619 --> 04:39:57,610
We're going to go feed you a bunch of pancakes and stuff.

4722
04:39:57,610 --> 04:40:10,500
Okay.

4723
04:40:10,500 --> 04:40:13,000
Tipsy, eat a pancake.

4724
04:40:15,270 --> 04:40:16,630
I want Tipsy to be social.

4725
04:40:17,669 --> 04:40:18,549
This is like not fair.

4726
04:40:27,799 --> 04:40:29,159
That was a violent sound.

4727
04:40:29,799 --> 04:40:30,680
Oh, stop.

4728
04:40:31,240 --> 04:40:32,439
Stop, stop, stop.

4729
04:40:32,439 --> 04:40:33,080
Come over here.

4730
04:40:34,490 --> 04:40:34,970
Pancake.

4731
04:40:51,270 --> 04:40:52,709
I'm busy trying to help.

4732
04:40:52,709 --> 04:40:55,580
That's not how you eat.

4733
04:41:01,450 --> 04:41:02,330
Oh, my goodness.

4734
04:41:03,930 --> 04:41:05,290
It's not time for you to cocoon yet.

4735
04:41:05,290 --> 04:41:06,169
You have to eat this.

4736
04:41:16,729 --> 04:41:19,369
Smush has lived a long life, but Smush is dead.

4737
04:41:21,349 --> 04:41:23,110
They're dropping like flies right now.

4738
04:41:23,669 --> 04:41:24,790
That's like three in a row.

4739
04:41:25,349 --> 04:42:06,279
Hi, Tuba.

4740
04:42:06,279 --> 04:42:20,950
Where are you going?

4741
04:42:20,950 --> 04:42:22,069
Give Smush to Tipsy.

4742
04:42:22,069 --> 04:42:32,150
That's the plan.

4743
04:42:32,150 --> 04:42:32,790
Eat it.

4744
04:42:32,790 --> 04:42:40,759
All right.

4745
04:42:40,759 --> 04:42:41,000
Come on.

4746
04:42:41,000 --> 04:42:41,560
What are you going to get?

4747
04:42:42,740 --> 04:42:49,459
How are you looking?

4748
04:42:49,459 --> 04:42:55,340
Okay.

4749
04:42:55,340 --> 04:42:56,860
Color change.

4750
04:42:58,740 --> 04:43:00,020
Legs have grown.

4751
04:43:00,020 --> 04:43:03,590
Tail has grown.

4752
04:43:03,590 --> 04:43:16,599
Body size has gone down and body length has gone down again.

4753
04:43:16,599 --> 04:43:17,400
It's all right.

4754
04:43:17,400 --> 04:43:21,080
Okay.

4755
04:43:21,080 --> 04:43:21,400
I need to...

4756
04:43:21,400 --> 04:43:26,409
Where is concrete floor?

4757
04:43:26,409 --> 04:43:27,130
I don't know.

4758
04:43:27,130 --> 04:43:33,880
What's wrong with you?

4759
04:43:33,880 --> 04:43:35,799
Why is he so...

4760
04:43:35,799 --> 04:43:36,599
Why is he huffing and puffing?

4761
04:43:36,599 --> 04:43:37,560
Why is he so pissed off?

4762
04:43:37,560 --> 04:43:39,750
What's wrong?

4763
04:43:39,750 --> 04:43:42,389
It's okay.

4764
04:43:42,389 --> 04:43:43,270
Calm down.

4765
04:43:43,270 --> 04:43:44,439
It's okay.

4766
04:43:44,439 --> 04:43:48,330
Everything's fine.

4767
04:43:48,330 --> 04:43:57,849
You guys want to play?

4768
04:43:57,849 --> 04:44:02,139
Oh, shit.

4769
04:44:02,139 --> 04:44:02,939
He's like, uh-oh.

4770
04:44:03,990 --> 04:44:04,709
Oh, fuck.

4771
04:44:13,700 --> 04:44:17,159
Tipsy is going to be the only one left.

4772
04:44:17,159 --> 04:44:17,400
All right.

4773
04:44:17,400 --> 04:44:20,599
Tipsy, you got to go eat.

4774
04:44:20,599 --> 04:44:20,919
All right.

4775
04:44:20,919 --> 04:44:21,799
Tipsy, get out.

4776
04:44:21,799 --> 04:44:23,540
Follow me.

4777
04:44:23,540 --> 04:44:29,860
Dude, Tuba is the first person to come and eat every single person.

4778
04:44:29,860 --> 04:44:30,819
Do you notice that?

4779
04:44:30,819 --> 04:44:46,439
I don't touch that, Tuba.

4780
04:44:50,900 --> 04:44:51,700
Tipsy, eat that.

4781
04:45:02,970 --> 04:45:04,409
Lifespan extended.

4782
04:45:04,409 --> 04:45:07,740
Okay.

4783
04:45:07,740 --> 04:45:09,939
I want...

4784
04:45:09,939 --> 04:45:11,139
Where's the other one?

4785
04:45:11,139 --> 04:45:11,779
Somebody else died.

4786
04:45:11,779 --> 04:45:12,259
Where are they?

4787
04:45:14,229 --> 04:45:15,560
Somebody...

4788
04:45:15,560 --> 04:45:16,279
Who else died?

4789
04:45:16,279 --> 04:45:17,080
They're on the ground somewhere.

4790
04:45:17,080 --> 04:45:18,119
They're like a box.

4791
04:45:18,119 --> 04:45:22,040
Eat that pizza.

4792
04:45:22,040 --> 04:45:28,970
Eat a pancake?

4793
04:45:28,970 --> 04:45:29,930
No, eat a chip.

4794
04:45:29,930 --> 04:45:37,930
You're so hungry.

4795
04:45:37,930 --> 04:45:38,169
All right.

4796
04:45:38,169 --> 04:45:38,729
Hold on.

4797
04:45:38,729 --> 04:45:41,959
Okay.

4798
04:45:41,959 --> 04:45:42,840
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4799
04:45:42,840 --> 04:45:43,720
It's back out, back out, back out, back out.

4800
04:45:43,720 --> 04:45:44,599
I got like capsules over here.

4801
04:45:44,599 --> 04:45:45,080
I didn't open.

4802
04:45:45,959 --> 04:45:49,240
No, no, no.

4803
04:45:49,240 --> 04:46:04,540
Eyeball jar and big snake wall.

4804
04:46:04,540 --> 04:46:04,779
Okay.

4805
04:46:05,340 --> 04:46:07,000
Who died?

4806
04:46:07,000 --> 04:46:07,400
Who is this?

4807
04:46:08,040 --> 04:46:09,830
Who did this eat?

4808
04:46:09,830 --> 04:46:10,709
What happened?

4809
04:46:10,709 --> 04:46:19,849
Eat the lasagna.

4810
04:46:19,849 --> 04:46:22,819
Where's the other dead body?

4811
04:46:28,360 --> 04:46:49,290
Oh, right here.

4812
04:46:49,290 --> 04:46:50,330
I'm feeding this to Courage.

4813
04:46:50,330 --> 04:46:51,369
I don't want Courage to die.

4814
04:46:51,369 --> 04:47:03,380
We need more deviled eggs.

4815
04:47:03,380 --> 04:47:03,860
Oh.

4816
04:47:03,860 --> 04:47:07,099
Proto and Tipsy.

4817
04:47:07,099 --> 04:47:07,900
That's the plan.

4818
04:47:12,090 --> 04:47:12,810
No, no, no, no.

4819
04:47:12,810 --> 04:47:13,610
No one's eating this.

4820
04:47:13,610 --> 04:47:14,090
I like this.

4821
04:47:14,090 --> 04:47:15,290
I like this one a lot.

4822
04:47:15,290 --> 04:47:15,849
I like this.

4823
04:47:15,849 --> 04:47:17,209
This is a good one.

4824
04:47:17,209 --> 04:47:19,830
Putting this in the memorial.

4825
04:47:19,830 --> 04:47:36,810
I don't know.

4826
04:47:36,810 --> 04:47:37,529
Stop.

4827
04:47:37,529 --> 04:47:42,979
Yeah.

4828
04:47:42,979 --> 04:47:43,619
This was Smush.

4829
04:47:43,619 --> 04:47:44,659
I like Smush a lot.

4830
04:47:44,659 --> 04:47:46,540
Smush was really cool.

4831
04:47:46,540 --> 04:47:57,419
Smush, a good dog.

4832
04:47:57,419 --> 04:48:07,509
There.

4833
04:48:07,509 --> 04:48:09,110
A little rowdy but loved everyone.

4834
04:48:09,110 --> 04:48:14,619
He's a good dog.

4835
04:48:14,619 --> 04:48:19,130
All right.

4836
04:48:19,130 --> 04:48:23,619
Go to sleep.

4837
04:48:23,619 --> 04:48:24,580
And go to sleep.

4838
04:48:24,580 --> 04:48:25,450
All right.

4839
04:48:25,450 --> 04:48:26,650
Rudolph, what do you got?

4840
04:48:26,650 --> 04:48:35,299
Starting to turn almost all golden.

4841
04:48:37,209 --> 04:48:43,240
Are those six legs?

4842
04:48:43,240 --> 04:48:49,990
Okay.

4843
04:48:49,990 --> 04:48:52,069
I lost a lot of leg gloss, but that's all right.

4844
04:48:52,069 --> 04:48:57,319
Tipsy, I need you to go to sleep.

4845
04:48:57,319 --> 04:49:00,630
Everyone else is fine.

4846
04:49:00,630 --> 04:49:02,459
Where's Tipsy?

4847
04:49:02,540 --> 04:49:05,110
Oh, there you are.

4848
04:49:05,110 --> 04:49:05,430
Okay.

4849
04:49:05,430 --> 04:49:05,990
Get in the house.

4850
04:49:13,479 --> 04:49:14,439
And sleep.

4851
04:49:14,439 --> 04:49:14,759
Okay.

4852
04:49:14,759 --> 04:49:15,000
Good.

4853
04:49:15,639 --> 04:49:16,279
Cool.

4854
04:49:16,279 --> 04:49:20,650
You look all right.

4855
04:49:20,650 --> 04:49:28,020
Upgrade the den.

4856
04:49:28,020 --> 04:49:28,419
I don't...

4857
04:49:28,419 --> 04:49:28,659
I don't...

4858
04:49:28,659 --> 04:49:32,020
Can I?

4859
04:49:32,020 --> 04:49:33,139
Corn dog.

4860
04:49:33,139 --> 04:49:45,290
Anyone piss on the ground?

4861
04:49:45,290 --> 04:49:46,779
Where's Snoopy?

4862
04:49:46,779 --> 04:49:47,419
Oh, shit.

4863
04:49:47,419 --> 04:49:47,900
You're right.

4864
04:49:47,900 --> 04:49:48,860
Where's Snoopy?

4865
04:49:48,860 --> 04:49:50,979
All right.

4866
04:49:50,979 --> 04:49:55,099
There's Snoopy.

4867
04:49:55,099 --> 04:49:55,819
Snoopy.

4868
04:49:55,819 --> 04:50:01,930
I didn't realize Snoopy was this little.

4869
04:50:01,930 --> 04:50:02,409
Uh-oh.

4870
04:50:02,409 --> 04:50:03,450
Tuba's dead.

4871
04:50:03,450 --> 04:50:08,200
Goodbye, Tuba.

4872
04:50:08,200 --> 04:50:33,159
This actually is really sad.

4873
04:50:33,159 --> 04:50:34,840
Courage is huge.

4874
04:50:34,840 --> 04:50:48,889
Should we memorialize Tuba or feed him to Courage?

4875
04:50:48,889 --> 04:50:49,290
I don't want...

4876
04:50:49,290 --> 04:50:53,259
I kind of want Courage to stay around.

4877
04:50:53,259 --> 04:50:54,459
Yeah, I want Courage to stick around.

4878
04:51:15,799 --> 04:51:21,099
Disgusting over here.

4879
04:51:21,099 --> 04:51:21,900
You monster.

4880
04:51:24,299 --> 04:51:25,419
It's a game mechanic.

4881
04:51:25,419 --> 04:51:27,340
I want some of them to stick around because they have...

4882
04:51:27,340 --> 04:51:27,900
They're really...

4883
04:51:29,380 --> 04:51:30,819
Like, he can walk around.

4884
04:51:31,700 --> 04:51:33,959
Are you telling me Courage and...

4885
04:51:35,319 --> 04:51:38,599
What are you guys doing?

4886
04:51:38,599 --> 04:51:47,369
I was going to combine these two,

4887
04:51:47,369 --> 04:51:49,049
but I don't think that's such a good idea.

4888
04:51:49,049 --> 04:51:54,060
Courage and Proto would be really good.

4889
04:51:56,380 --> 04:51:56,700
God.

4890
04:51:59,430 --> 04:52:00,069
I don't know.

4891
04:52:00,069 --> 04:52:00,869
You know what I mean?

4892
04:52:00,869 --> 04:52:03,369
How you doing, Snoopy?

4893
04:52:03,369 --> 04:52:04,409
You need some food?

4894
04:52:04,409 --> 04:52:08,680
Do it now?

4895
04:52:08,680 --> 04:52:09,880
I don't think I can.

4896
04:52:15,270 --> 04:52:16,220
Oh, I can.

4897
04:52:16,220 --> 04:52:16,619
I can.

4898
04:52:16,619 --> 04:52:16,939
I can.

4899
04:52:16,939 --> 04:52:17,659
Perfect.

4900
04:52:17,659 --> 04:52:18,709
All right.

4901
04:52:18,709 --> 04:52:19,110
Let's go.

4902
04:52:19,669 --> 04:52:20,630
This is it.

4903
04:52:20,630 --> 04:52:21,029
Let's do it.

4904
04:52:39,580 --> 04:52:40,939
We lost the spots.

4905
04:52:40,939 --> 04:52:51,819
Did we?

4906
04:52:51,819 --> 04:52:54,139
It was gone immediately.

4907
04:52:54,139 --> 04:53:00,299
He kind of looks like a little pig.

4908
04:53:00,299 --> 04:53:21,139
Look at this one.

4909
04:53:21,139 --> 04:53:47,319
They only have three legs.

4910
04:53:47,319 --> 04:54:06,650
I don't know what to do about this.

4911
04:54:06,650 --> 04:54:07,450
I don't think we can even...

4912
04:54:07,450 --> 04:54:08,970
We can't even fertilize this.

4913
04:54:08,970 --> 04:54:14,119
We got to hope for, like, just a huge mutation here.

4914
04:54:14,119 --> 04:54:26,860
Still three legs.

4915
04:54:26,860 --> 04:55:08,900
Sorry, I realized I was biting my lip,

4916
04:55:09,540 --> 04:55:10,659
and I don't want you to see it.

4917
04:55:10,659 --> 04:55:16,549
Do Proto and Tipsy.

4918
04:55:16,549 --> 04:55:18,229
Uh, Tipsy is not old enough.

4919
04:55:18,229 --> 04:55:20,069
I will when Tipsy's old enough.

4920
04:55:20,069 --> 04:55:23,819
Tripod?

4921
04:55:23,819 --> 04:55:35,619
Yeah, Tipsy's not an adult yet.

4922
04:55:36,419 --> 04:55:36,979
Do I even...

4923
04:55:36,979 --> 04:55:38,659
I don't even know if I want to hatch.

4924
04:55:38,659 --> 04:55:39,720
I mean, whatever.

4925
04:55:39,720 --> 04:55:42,299
Tipsy's getting bigger, though.

4926
04:55:42,299 --> 04:55:47,819
Everybody seems to be doing okay.

4927
04:55:56,220 --> 04:55:58,540
These two are the closest related...

4928
04:55:58,540 --> 04:55:59,180
Oh, my God.

4929
04:55:59,180 --> 04:55:59,580
I don't know.

4930
04:55:59,580 --> 04:56:00,220
I'm going to have to...

4931
04:56:00,220 --> 04:56:02,569
I was going to stream tomorrow, but maybe I won't.

4932
04:56:04,229 --> 04:56:05,909
I don't know what the fuck is going on here.

4933
04:56:05,909 --> 04:56:16,419
How come they're eating dirt?

4934
04:56:16,419 --> 04:56:16,900
Save the game.

4935
04:56:16,900 --> 04:56:17,380
Yep.

4936
04:56:17,380 --> 04:56:22,380
Give Tipsy a bigger body, please.

4937
04:56:22,380 --> 04:56:24,360
I honestly...

4938
04:56:24,360 --> 04:56:24,840
I need...

4939
04:56:24,840 --> 04:56:31,930
What does that?

4940
04:56:31,930 --> 04:56:34,169
Feed Tipsy a bunch of lasagna.

4941
04:56:34,169 --> 04:56:36,009
Come on, Tipsy.

4942
04:56:36,009 --> 04:56:36,330
Let's go.

4943
04:56:38,259 --> 04:56:38,740
Wrong room.

4944
04:56:50,740 --> 04:56:51,459
Lasagna.

4945
04:56:51,459 --> 04:56:55,340
Have some lasagna.

4946
04:57:02,889 --> 04:57:03,930
Maybe time to end the stream.

4947
04:57:03,930 --> 04:57:04,810
Don't hurt your voice.

4948
04:57:04,810 --> 04:57:08,220
I'll be okay.

4949
04:57:08,220 --> 04:57:08,860
All right.

4950
04:57:08,860 --> 04:57:09,419
Good.

4951
04:57:09,419 --> 04:57:09,900
Ooh.

4952
04:57:09,900 --> 04:57:11,159
A tooth.

4953
04:57:11,159 --> 04:57:15,909
Teeth make you big, too, don't they?

4954
04:57:15,909 --> 04:57:16,150
All right.

4955
04:57:16,150 --> 04:57:16,389
Good.

4956
04:57:16,389 --> 04:57:18,819
Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.

4957
04:57:18,819 --> 04:57:19,619
Um...

4958
04:57:19,619 --> 04:57:24,009
Want a pancake?

4959
04:57:24,009 --> 04:57:31,669
Turn this shit off.

4960
04:57:31,669 --> 04:57:41,369
Is it people saying Tripod?

4961
04:57:41,369 --> 04:57:42,169
Tripod?

4962
04:57:42,169 --> 04:57:56,860
Tripod sounds good.

4963
04:57:56,860 --> 04:57:59,459
Is that a raid?

4964
04:57:59,459 --> 04:57:59,779
Is there?

4965
04:57:59,779 --> 04:58:02,360
I don't see one.

4966
04:58:02,360 --> 04:58:03,639
The dashboard doesn't say anything.

4967
04:58:03,639 --> 04:58:08,630
Tripod is fucked, dude.

4968
04:58:08,630 --> 04:58:10,419
That is fucked.

4969
04:58:10,419 --> 04:58:11,380
Can I rename?

4970
04:58:11,380 --> 04:58:17,189
You gotta sing, it's Tomar.

4971
04:58:17,189 --> 04:58:18,389
What's up, Tomar?

4972
04:58:18,389 --> 04:58:22,709
Sorry, my voice is fucked up.

4973
04:58:22,709 --> 04:58:23,909
Snoopy is eating poop.

4974
04:58:24,709 --> 04:58:27,290
It doesn't matter, okay?

4975
04:58:27,290 --> 04:58:28,250
It really doesn't matter.

4976
04:58:28,250 --> 04:58:30,979
What's going on?

4977
04:58:30,979 --> 04:58:35,240
Thanks for, uh, thanks for stopping by.

4978
04:58:35,240 --> 04:58:37,080
Sing the Tomar theme song.

4979
04:58:37,080 --> 04:58:40,180
I don't know what that is.

4980
04:58:40,180 --> 04:58:42,099
Go to the dog storage, you can rename.

4981
04:58:42,099 --> 04:58:42,979
Yeah, that's fucking bad.

4982
04:58:42,979 --> 04:58:44,180
I don't want it to be that.

4983
04:58:45,529 --> 04:58:46,490
That's so awful.

4984
04:58:46,490 --> 04:58:51,979
No, I'm gonna name it, like, Breezy.

4985
04:58:51,979 --> 04:58:52,700
Breezy's better.

4986
04:58:54,599 --> 04:58:56,819
I like Breezy.

4987
04:58:56,819 --> 04:58:57,939
Breezy's fine.

4988
04:58:57,939 --> 04:59:03,110
You called one of your dogs Tipsy.

4989
04:59:03,110 --> 04:59:05,720
Yeah, like, teeny, like, Tipsy.

4990
04:59:05,720 --> 04:59:06,279
I don't know.

4991
04:59:06,279 --> 04:59:07,880
Wait, was that, was that bad?

4992
04:59:09,349 --> 04:59:10,150
Where is Tipsy?

4993
04:59:12,869 --> 04:59:14,709
But I, I was supposed to be, like, teeny.

4994
04:59:18,619 --> 04:59:19,740
All right, come on.

4995
04:59:19,740 --> 04:59:20,700
Let's see what we get here.

4996
04:59:23,700 --> 04:59:25,060
Like, itsy bitsy.

4997
04:59:25,619 --> 04:59:26,180
Yeah, I don't know.

4998
04:59:26,180 --> 04:59:27,380
I looked over in chat and somebody,

4999
04:59:27,380 --> 04:59:28,340
that was just rhymed.

5000
04:59:36,840 --> 04:59:38,520
You called the fucked up one Tipsy.

5001
04:59:39,380 --> 04:59:41,220
I don't think that's fair because I called,

5002
04:59:44,310 --> 04:59:45,110
what's this one called?

5003
04:59:51,880 --> 04:59:52,520
Eat one of these.

5004
04:59:57,900 --> 04:59:59,180
Worst parent ever.

5005
04:59:59,180 --> 05:00:00,860
It's not copium, I'm serious.

5006
05:00:01,830 --> 05:00:02,869
I'm serious.

5007
05:00:02,869 --> 05:00:04,470
It's not copium, I'm serious.

5008
05:00:05,029 --> 05:00:19,779
Okay, all right, we got something good.

5009
05:00:19,779 --> 05:00:33,209
And you can't get any smaller.

5010
05:00:33,209 --> 05:00:43,479
My god, dude, what the fuck?

5011
05:00:43,479 --> 05:00:44,439
That was evil.

5012
05:00:44,439 --> 05:00:45,479
I didn't even touch that.

5013
05:00:45,479 --> 05:00:46,360
I didn't do anything.

5014
05:00:49,619 --> 05:00:51,459
Tipsy's been eating lasagna all day.

5015
05:00:51,459 --> 05:00:52,659
How is it possible?

5016
05:00:52,659 --> 05:01:07,689
That was at least 15 feet.

5017
05:01:08,889 --> 05:01:10,250
That was at least 15 feet.

5018
05:01:10,250 --> 05:01:16,740
I think we're on the right track.

5019
05:01:16,740 --> 05:01:23,450
That's, I don't like that name.

5020
05:01:23,450 --> 05:01:24,650
I actually don't like that name.

5021
05:01:24,650 --> 05:01:26,409
That name is so fucking awful.

5022
05:01:26,409 --> 05:01:28,009
Something else, something else, something else.

5023
05:01:28,970 --> 05:01:29,930
Where's my storage?

5024
05:01:29,930 --> 05:01:30,889
Something else, something else.

5025
05:01:30,889 --> 05:01:31,610
I don't like that name.

5026
05:01:32,330 --> 05:01:33,209
I don't like that name.

5027
05:01:33,689 --> 05:01:39,580
How do I rename?

5028
05:01:40,139 --> 05:01:57,619
How do you rename?

5029
05:01:57,619 --> 05:01:58,099
Brunch?

5030
05:01:58,099 --> 05:01:58,580
I don't know.

5031
05:01:59,380 --> 05:02:00,099
Brunch.

5032
05:02:00,099 --> 05:02:03,240
There, that's better.

5033
05:02:05,189 --> 05:02:05,830
Brunch.

5034
05:02:05,830 --> 05:02:20,810
I don't know what you're doing.

5035
05:02:20,810 --> 05:02:30,020
I think, I think he's trying to...

5036
05:02:30,020 --> 05:02:38,860
You all right?

5037
05:02:38,860 --> 05:02:39,819
She puked.

5038
05:02:39,819 --> 05:02:52,779
Pretty pumped up about that, by the way.

5039
05:02:55,139 --> 05:03:11,720
Hey, hey, you need to breed Snoopy.

5040
05:03:11,720 --> 05:03:16,119
I like the color scheme.

5041
05:03:16,119 --> 05:03:17,240
Not much change, it's fine.

5042
05:03:17,240 --> 05:03:18,119
Okay, so can I?

5043
05:03:18,119 --> 05:03:18,759
Let's see.

5044
05:03:18,759 --> 05:03:20,779
Tipsy's not old enough.

5045
05:03:20,779 --> 05:03:22,470
Can't happen.

5046
05:03:22,470 --> 05:03:23,669
One more mutation.

5047
05:03:23,669 --> 05:03:27,240
When did the dog stop fighting?

5048
05:03:29,020 --> 05:03:30,220
There's been a few fights already.

5049
05:03:31,610 --> 05:03:32,970
I had to break up a couple of them.

5050
05:03:32,970 --> 05:03:33,930
One of them was really bad.

5051
05:03:34,569 --> 05:03:37,900
One just wouldn't let go.

5052
05:03:37,900 --> 05:03:39,180
It's like, kind of fucked up.

5053
05:03:43,580 --> 05:03:44,700
Just checking to see if something piss.

5054
05:03:45,259 --> 05:03:56,279
My brunch is ready to mutate.

5055
05:03:56,279 --> 05:04:14,139
Anybody hungry or anything?

5056
05:04:14,139 --> 05:04:15,639
Snoopy's tired.

5057
05:04:15,639 --> 05:04:20,919
Oops, I'm sorry.

5058
05:04:20,919 --> 05:04:22,279
Come over here and sleep.

5059
05:04:22,279 --> 05:04:23,319
You don't, you get...

5060
05:04:23,319 --> 05:04:27,450
Come here, it's okay, come here.

5061
05:04:27,450 --> 05:04:28,090
Stay in the corner.

5062
05:04:28,650 --> 05:04:29,610
Courage is a big dog.

5063
05:04:29,610 --> 05:04:30,490
Be careful.

5064
05:04:30,490 --> 05:04:43,830
Not much of a change.

5065
05:04:45,259 --> 05:04:48,360
I don't think they ate very much.

5066
05:04:48,360 --> 05:04:48,919
No, they didn't.

5067
05:04:52,919 --> 05:04:54,279
Eat some lasagna.

5068
05:04:54,279 --> 05:04:56,310
Here.

5069
05:04:56,310 --> 05:04:57,270
Lasagna makes you big.

5070
05:05:02,650 --> 05:05:03,689
Oh, Tipsy, I'm so sorry.

5071
05:05:03,689 --> 05:05:04,169
You need help.

5072
05:05:04,169 --> 05:05:04,650
Okay.

5073
05:05:04,650 --> 05:05:05,529
Tipsy needs to eat.

5074
05:05:09,240 --> 05:05:09,720
I don't know.

5075
05:05:10,360 --> 05:05:12,200
I keep trying to feed Tipsy stuff,

5076
05:05:12,200 --> 05:05:12,840
but it doesn't work.

5077
05:05:13,720 --> 05:05:14,700
Deviled eggs, right?

5078
05:05:15,340 --> 05:05:16,630
A couple of deviled eggs?

5079
05:05:33,509 --> 05:05:34,709
All right, let's relax for a second.

5080
05:05:34,709 --> 05:05:35,430
And you should go to sleep.

5081
05:05:36,069 --> 05:05:38,549
French fries?

5082
05:05:50,229 --> 05:05:51,029
I know, all right.

5083
05:05:51,029 --> 05:05:52,310
Tipsy's sleeping.

5084
05:05:52,310 --> 05:05:53,580
I'm gonna leave Tipsy alone.

5085
05:05:59,049 --> 05:06:00,169
Eat this coconut.

5086
05:06:00,169 --> 05:06:05,369
This is dirt, never...

5087
05:06:05,369 --> 05:06:06,650
Okay, well, whatever.

5088
05:06:06,650 --> 05:06:07,770
He's delayed it.

5089
05:06:07,770 --> 05:06:13,459
How come Tipsy's built like that?

5090
05:06:13,459 --> 05:06:16,340
It's because we were doing some experiments.

5091
05:06:16,979 --> 05:06:18,569
I kind of just ended up that way.

5092
05:06:19,849 --> 05:06:24,520
Hello, brunch.

5093
05:06:24,520 --> 05:06:28,250
Sarah, are you okay?

5094
05:06:28,250 --> 05:06:31,779
You looking to play?

5095
05:06:31,779 --> 05:06:32,500
Here, play with the ball.

5096
05:06:33,060 --> 05:06:35,959
Throw it.

5097
05:06:35,959 --> 05:06:37,080
Throw that ball.

5098
05:06:37,080 --> 05:06:39,930
Oh, jump on it.

5099
05:06:39,930 --> 05:06:40,810
Throw it.

5100
05:06:40,810 --> 05:06:48,869
Go get it.

5101
05:06:48,869 --> 05:06:52,180
You have too many legs.

5102
05:06:52,180 --> 05:06:52,819
Nobody can...

5103
05:06:52,819 --> 05:06:53,619
This whole time,

5104
05:06:53,619 --> 05:06:55,060
no one's been able to do anything.

5105
05:06:55,060 --> 05:06:59,080
They have too many legs.

5106
05:06:59,080 --> 05:07:00,360
They can't even run.

5107
05:07:00,360 --> 05:07:04,330
Is that...

5108
05:07:09,419 --> 05:07:11,340
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

5109
05:07:11,340 --> 05:07:12,860
I'm trying to move him over to the ball.

5110
05:07:13,500 --> 05:07:22,599
Okay, get it.

5111
05:07:22,599 --> 05:07:31,049
Have a coconut.

5112
05:07:31,049 --> 05:07:38,389
Oh, shit.

5113
05:07:38,389 --> 05:07:38,869
Cool.

5114
05:07:38,869 --> 05:07:45,369
Play dead.

5115
05:07:45,369 --> 05:07:46,569
New trick.

5116
05:07:46,569 --> 05:07:47,909
Nice trick.

5117
05:07:47,909 --> 05:07:48,790
Very good job.

5118
05:07:48,790 --> 05:07:49,509
Good, good, good.

5119
05:07:49,509 --> 05:07:50,389
Good trick.

5120
05:07:50,389 --> 05:07:53,939
What are you doing over there?

5121
05:07:53,939 --> 05:07:55,830
Playing with some dirt?

5122
05:07:55,830 --> 05:07:56,709
That's funny.

5123
05:07:56,709 --> 05:07:59,700
That's funny.

5124
05:08:04,099 --> 05:08:04,900
Throw it.

5125
05:08:04,900 --> 05:08:08,470
I don't know what you're throwing.

5126
05:08:10,229 --> 05:08:20,439
I don't know what you're...

5127
05:08:20,439 --> 05:08:21,639
I don't know what's...

5128
05:08:21,639 --> 05:08:23,000
Okay, I think he's falling asleep.

5129
05:08:23,720 --> 05:08:27,430
He's sleeping standing up.

5130
05:08:28,069 --> 05:08:39,799
I don't have any den upgrades.

5131
05:08:40,439 --> 05:08:46,409
Courage is hungry.

5132
05:08:46,970 --> 05:08:51,130
I need to at least level up.

5133
05:08:51,130 --> 05:08:52,009
Tipsy.

5134
05:08:52,009 --> 05:08:58,310
French fries.

5135
05:08:59,110 --> 05:09:01,180
Yeah, have another french fry.

5136
05:09:01,180 --> 05:09:06,680
Come on, you can get it.

5137
05:09:06,680 --> 05:09:07,860
There you go.

5138
05:09:07,860 --> 05:09:08,659
There you go.

5139
05:09:08,659 --> 05:09:10,549
You can do it.

5140
05:09:15,349 --> 05:09:16,869
There's progress here with tips.

5141
05:09:16,869 --> 05:09:17,669
I think we just need to...

5142
05:09:17,669 --> 05:09:19,270
The legs need to be spread out more.

5143
05:09:19,270 --> 05:09:20,970
I need body length.

5144
05:09:20,970 --> 05:09:22,169
French fries should do it, I hope.

5145
05:09:23,939 --> 05:09:24,419
I hope so.

5146
05:09:29,720 --> 05:09:31,159
Just with a little bit of increased body,

5147
05:09:31,880 --> 05:09:34,970
they can move around.

5148
05:09:34,970 --> 05:09:41,830
Courage you need.

5149
05:09:43,860 --> 05:09:44,740
Eat something.

5150
05:09:44,740 --> 05:09:45,299
Have one of these.

5151
05:09:46,889 --> 05:09:50,840
Here, eat that.

5152
05:09:50,840 --> 05:09:51,319
That was it?

5153
05:09:51,319 --> 05:09:51,639
Really?

5154
05:09:51,639 --> 05:09:53,560
How about I have a chicken?

5155
05:09:53,560 --> 05:09:54,360
Oh, no, corn dog.

5156
05:09:54,360 --> 05:09:55,479
Yeah, that's a new thing.

5157
05:09:55,479 --> 05:09:58,150
Here, try that.

5158
05:09:58,150 --> 05:10:03,619
Oh, shit.

5159
05:10:03,619 --> 05:10:04,580
Right, Rudolph.

5160
05:10:04,580 --> 05:10:10,549
Interesting.

5161
05:10:11,509 --> 05:10:12,490
Much bigger head.

5162
05:10:15,290 --> 05:10:16,009
Back length.

5163
05:10:16,819 --> 05:10:17,619
Back leg width.

5164
05:10:19,610 --> 05:10:20,330
A lot of growth.

5165
05:10:20,970 --> 05:10:24,259
Bigger legs.

5166
05:10:24,259 --> 05:10:25,380
That's probably better.

5167
05:10:25,380 --> 05:10:26,659
That's probably helps.

5168
05:10:26,659 --> 05:10:30,040
All right, have one of these.

5169
05:10:30,040 --> 05:10:33,400
Have one of those chips.

5170
05:10:34,040 --> 05:10:35,990
And the nose is getting red again, yeah?

5171
05:10:35,990 --> 05:10:36,630
That looks cool.

5172
05:10:38,310 --> 05:10:41,240
I'm supposed to eat a cocoon, why not?

5173
05:10:45,430 --> 05:10:46,950
How close are you to evolving?

5174
05:10:46,950 --> 05:10:50,340
Have some corn.

5175
05:10:50,900 --> 05:10:52,419
You like corn?

5176
05:10:58,470 --> 05:11:00,069
Seen but often not heard.

5177
05:11:06,869 --> 05:11:08,790
I think we're going to get a good evolution here with tipsy.

5178
05:11:13,290 --> 05:11:13,849
Come over here.

5179
05:11:13,849 --> 05:11:15,049
Come downstairs.

5180
05:11:15,049 --> 05:11:18,869
I want you to participate.

5181
05:11:18,869 --> 05:11:20,150
I don't want you to just be up here by yourself.

5182
05:11:20,150 --> 05:11:21,509
Come on, come up here.

5183
05:11:21,509 --> 05:11:23,740
I want you to participate.

5184
05:11:23,740 --> 05:11:24,380
Come have fun.

5185
05:11:24,939 --> 05:11:27,990
Let's put on some music.

5186
05:11:28,549 --> 05:11:31,159
Let's get some tunes on.

5187
05:11:31,720 --> 05:11:34,119
And have everybody come over here and hang out.

5188
05:11:34,119 --> 05:11:42,549
Why are you biting his tail?

5189
05:11:42,549 --> 05:11:47,139
Don't bite his tail.

5190
05:11:47,139 --> 05:11:47,700
There we go.

5191
05:11:53,459 --> 05:11:53,700
Look.

5192
05:11:54,419 --> 05:11:56,790
This is all right.

5193
05:11:56,790 --> 05:11:57,349
Good, good.

5194
05:11:57,349 --> 05:11:58,150
Here comes the evolution.

5195
05:12:00,419 --> 05:12:01,060
Okay, come on.

5196
05:12:01,700 --> 05:12:04,279
See if we can...

5197
05:12:05,000 --> 05:12:07,419
The body just needs to lengthen and that's probably fine.

5198
05:12:07,419 --> 05:12:09,740
I don't want tipsy to be up there by itself.

5199
05:12:09,740 --> 05:12:10,779
No, I'm good.

5200
05:12:10,779 --> 05:12:13,240
What are you doing?

5201
05:12:13,240 --> 05:12:25,720
Jungle carpet?

5202
05:12:25,720 --> 05:12:27,400
That's a screenshot if I've ever seen it.

5203
05:12:27,400 --> 05:12:27,959
That's so cute.

5204
05:12:28,520 --> 05:12:38,810
All right, come on.

5205
05:12:39,369 --> 05:12:39,849
What do we got?

5206
05:12:40,409 --> 05:12:44,069
I think that's better.

5207
05:12:45,479 --> 05:12:49,590
Yep.

5208
05:12:49,590 --> 05:12:50,389
Front top leg.

5209
05:12:51,319 --> 05:12:52,520
Body girth.

5210
05:12:52,520 --> 05:12:54,200
Body length has increased.

5211
05:12:54,200 --> 05:13:00,549
Okay, it's increased by a little bit.

5212
05:13:00,549 --> 05:13:01,509
By 3.2%.

5213
05:13:05,000 --> 05:13:09,369
Slim down.

5214
05:13:09,369 --> 05:13:14,250
Okay.

5215
05:13:14,250 --> 05:13:16,729
All right, that actually looks better.

5216
05:13:16,729 --> 05:13:19,099
That actually looks a lot better.

5217
05:13:19,099 --> 05:13:24,330
I think one more evolution with a little bit of length and...

5218
05:13:25,369 --> 05:13:26,180
You lost a leg?

5219
05:13:26,740 --> 05:13:32,259
No, you didn't.

5220
05:13:32,259 --> 05:13:35,990
Proto, what are you up to?

5221
05:13:35,990 --> 05:13:38,090
All right, now we can do this.

5222
05:13:38,090 --> 05:13:38,729
We can breed, yeah.

5223
05:13:42,709 --> 05:13:43,909
Tipsy and Proto.

5224
05:13:44,470 --> 05:13:45,400
Okay, here we go.

5225
05:13:45,400 --> 05:13:45,799
Let's do it.

5226
05:13:45,799 --> 05:13:46,360
Let's see it.

5227
05:13:46,360 --> 05:13:46,759
This is it.

5228
05:13:47,000 --> 05:13:47,479
This is the big one.

5229
05:13:50,470 --> 05:13:54,180
Got spots.

5230
05:14:06,779 --> 05:14:07,500
Oh, wow.

5231
05:14:08,299 --> 05:14:08,860
Oh, wow.

5232
05:14:09,939 --> 05:14:10,259
Wow.

5233
05:14:11,419 --> 05:14:11,740
Okay.

5234
05:14:12,299 --> 05:14:15,430
That's when his heart's all over it.

5235
05:14:19,830 --> 05:14:21,830
There are two candidates here.

5236
05:14:21,830 --> 05:14:24,069
I wonder if I should keep going.

5237
05:14:25,270 --> 05:14:26,790
Or just grab the one with the hearts.

5238
05:14:32,090 --> 05:14:32,650
Yeah, let's do it.

5239
05:14:33,799 --> 05:14:34,200
Very cool.

5240
05:14:36,299 --> 05:14:37,659
I could do this again, too.

5241
05:14:37,659 --> 05:14:57,659
I want to do Proto and Rudolph.

5242
05:14:57,659 --> 05:14:59,849
I want some more spots.

5243
05:15:00,490 --> 05:15:05,720
Okay, that's kind of cool.

5244
05:15:05,720 --> 05:15:06,439
Anybody have spots?

5245
05:15:08,419 --> 05:15:12,220
You do and you do.

5246
05:15:18,040 --> 05:15:18,599
Very cool.

5247
05:15:18,599 --> 05:15:21,080
All right, the hearts again.

5248
05:15:21,720 --> 05:15:27,240
Another variation.

5249
05:15:27,799 --> 05:15:46,139
Very cool.

5250
05:15:46,139 --> 05:15:46,939
New tail.

5251
05:15:46,939 --> 05:15:48,520
Wait, there was a new tail?

5252
05:15:48,520 --> 05:15:51,369
That is a new tail, isn't it?

5253
05:15:51,369 --> 05:16:10,389
I don't want to go much further here.

5254
05:16:10,389 --> 05:16:11,270
I think this is perfect.

5255
05:16:11,270 --> 05:16:14,389
Who from this litter though?

5256
05:16:14,389 --> 05:16:15,110
Probably you.

5257
05:16:15,110 --> 05:16:19,209
Probably this one.

5258
05:16:19,209 --> 05:16:19,770
New pattern?

5259
05:16:20,330 --> 05:16:20,889
Oh, shit.

5260
05:16:20,889 --> 05:16:21,689
There is a new pattern.

5261
05:16:22,250 --> 05:16:25,479
All right, we're taking this one.

5262
05:16:26,040 --> 05:16:38,229
All right, I'll take this next one to zero.

5263
05:16:38,229 --> 05:16:39,270
Oh, I don't have another egg.

5264
05:16:39,270 --> 05:16:43,580
Do I?

5265
05:16:43,580 --> 05:16:45,099
I'm going to have to store some people.

5266
05:16:45,740 --> 05:16:49,639
What do I store?

5267
05:16:50,279 --> 05:16:52,889
I don't know.

5268
05:16:52,889 --> 05:16:56,310
Who should I store?

5269
05:16:56,310 --> 05:16:57,669
I'm going to have way too many people.

5270
05:16:57,669 --> 05:17:05,080
It's the one with hearts.

5271
05:17:10,860 --> 05:17:11,360
Cupid?

5272
05:17:13,509 --> 05:17:14,790
Oh, I like Valentine.

5273
05:17:16,840 --> 05:17:17,639
Valentine's a good one.

5274
05:17:21,779 --> 05:17:22,819
I'm going to store Rudolph.

5275
05:17:22,819 --> 05:17:23,700
That's a good idea.

5276
05:17:27,720 --> 05:17:36,330
Maybe store Rudolph and maybe Proto?

5277
05:17:36,330 --> 05:17:46,740
That's a good idea.

5278
05:17:46,740 --> 05:17:48,180
I got to clean up a little bit for a second.

5279
05:17:48,180 --> 05:17:48,680
Hold on.

5280
05:17:59,020 --> 05:17:59,520
A mess.

5281
05:17:59,979 --> 05:18:08,330
I'll leave a little garden down here.

5282
05:18:08,330 --> 05:18:10,119
That's fine.

5283
05:18:10,119 --> 05:18:11,560
None of this is a bullshit.

5284
05:18:25,639 --> 05:18:27,080
You've already mutated already?

5285
05:18:27,080 --> 05:18:27,580
Okay.

5286
05:18:32,340 --> 05:18:33,139
All right, this is...

5287
05:18:33,139 --> 05:18:36,150
What's my name?

5288
05:18:36,150 --> 05:18:40,709
This dog.

5289
05:18:40,709 --> 05:18:43,209
How about like Macaron?

5290
05:18:43,209 --> 05:18:43,709
That's a good one.

5291
05:18:46,060 --> 05:18:47,240
Sponge?

5292
05:18:51,459 --> 05:18:51,959
Sweetie?

5293
05:18:53,130 --> 05:18:54,009
Sweetie's not bad.

5294
05:18:55,770 --> 05:18:56,270
Jason?

5295
05:18:56,889 --> 05:19:02,740
How about Spongy?

5296
05:19:09,639 --> 05:19:10,680
Where's Tipsy?

5297
05:19:10,680 --> 05:19:11,240
Oh, right there.

5298
05:19:11,240 --> 05:19:11,479
Okay.

5299
05:19:11,479 --> 05:19:19,299
Tipsy's asleep?

5300
05:19:19,299 --> 05:19:20,500
Her just digging more.

5301
05:19:20,500 --> 05:19:21,380
Oh, keep doing that.

5302
05:19:22,259 --> 05:19:22,900
Very good job.

5303
05:19:23,459 --> 05:19:25,990
All right.

5304
05:19:25,990 --> 05:19:27,509
Tipsy, go to bed over here.

5305
05:19:27,509 --> 05:19:33,319
I got to do some decorating.

5306
05:19:34,200 --> 05:19:42,310
I don't even have to upgrade the den.

5307
05:19:43,189 --> 05:19:44,259
Doing it for me.

5308
05:20:01,930 --> 05:20:09,990
Jesus.

5309
05:20:09,990 --> 05:20:10,950
Taking forever.

5310
05:20:11,590 --> 05:20:12,310
Holy shit.

5311
05:20:13,639 --> 05:20:14,279
Check achievements.

5312
05:20:14,840 --> 05:20:26,470
I want to say 34% taller.

5313
05:20:26,470 --> 05:20:31,860
Wasn't that tall to begin with, but...

5314
05:20:31,860 --> 05:20:32,900
I guess it's a little bit bigger.

5315
05:20:33,860 --> 05:20:37,799
All right, I've been playing for five hours.

5316
05:20:37,799 --> 05:20:41,799
I have...

5317
05:20:41,799 --> 05:20:42,759
Okay, hold on a second.

5318
05:20:42,759 --> 05:20:44,119
This is where it gets weird.

5319
05:20:44,119 --> 05:21:01,450
Oh, shit.

5320
05:21:01,450 --> 05:21:01,950
Okay.

5321
05:21:02,810 --> 05:21:11,799
I have to redo this whole thing.

5322
05:21:11,799 --> 05:21:15,299
Oh, do I?

5323
05:21:15,299 --> 05:21:16,180
No, I don't.

5324
05:21:16,180 --> 05:21:19,400
They don't all have to be connected to each other.

5325
05:21:30,650 --> 05:22:39,909
Oh, shit.

5326
05:22:39,909 --> 05:22:40,549
I'm sorry.

5327
05:22:40,549 --> 05:22:50,459
I got so many more rooms.

5328
05:22:50,459 --> 05:22:52,680
I need some planning.

5329
05:22:52,680 --> 05:22:54,040
I need to plan this better.

5330
05:22:54,040 --> 05:22:58,360
This is the starting room, which is going to have...

5331
05:22:58,360 --> 05:23:00,490
It's very basic.

5332
05:23:00,490 --> 05:23:01,500
I like the clouds.

5333
05:23:01,500 --> 05:23:02,459
Clouds are fine.

5334
05:23:02,459 --> 05:23:08,650
Messing up.

5335
05:23:08,650 --> 05:23:10,020
That's not bad.

5336
05:23:10,020 --> 05:23:10,659
All right, I like that.

5337
05:23:11,619 --> 05:23:12,979
Oh, I got to figure out what...

5338
05:23:12,979 --> 05:23:14,939
Okay, this is the memorial.

5339
05:23:14,939 --> 05:23:15,819
I can stay that way.

5340
05:23:15,819 --> 05:23:16,299
One of my...

5341
05:23:16,299 --> 05:23:17,500
This is the food room.

5342
05:23:17,500 --> 05:23:18,700
Let's have two food rooms.

5343
05:23:27,909 --> 05:23:30,790
Okay, all the food has to be in one spot.

5344
05:24:15,659 --> 05:24:16,060
What the...

5345
05:24:16,060 --> 05:24:17,419
I can make them small?

5346
05:24:17,419 --> 05:24:22,950
Why didn't I do this in the first place?

5347
05:24:22,950 --> 05:24:37,270
I didn't know I could make them that small.

5348
05:24:37,270 --> 05:24:43,349
This is pretty huge.

5349
05:24:43,349 --> 05:24:44,200
Perfect.

5350
05:24:44,200 --> 05:24:44,840
Okay, cool.

5351
05:24:44,840 --> 05:24:48,360
Very cool.

5352
05:24:48,360 --> 05:24:51,509
Now, this room is kind of ugly.

5353
05:24:51,509 --> 05:24:53,349
I don't really like the carpet that much.

5354
05:24:53,349 --> 05:24:55,909
It's hard to even see the food on the floor.

5355
05:24:55,909 --> 05:24:58,540
What, like a cafeteria?

5356
05:24:58,540 --> 05:24:59,659
That sounds better to me.

5357
05:24:59,659 --> 05:25:05,930
Pull this room down a little.

5358
05:25:05,930 --> 05:25:18,630
Okay.

5359
05:25:18,630 --> 05:25:19,430
No, I don't need that.

5360
05:25:19,430 --> 05:25:20,150
It looks good.

5361
05:25:20,150 --> 05:25:22,090
All right, that's the food room.

5362
05:25:22,090 --> 05:25:26,200
So then all other food, get rid of it.

5363
05:25:26,200 --> 05:25:27,639
I don't want this anymore.

5364
05:25:27,639 --> 05:25:34,060
Put the couch over here somewhere like right here.

5365
05:25:36,869 --> 05:25:38,310
The memorials will go here.

5366
05:25:38,310 --> 05:25:44,819
I'll probably have a few of those in a minute.

5367
05:25:44,819 --> 05:25:45,540
What is this place?

5368
05:25:46,939 --> 05:25:47,580
This is the toy room.

5369
05:25:47,580 --> 05:25:48,540
Okay, the toy room is fine.

5370
05:25:48,540 --> 05:25:49,819
We'll just get rid of this.

5371
05:25:49,819 --> 05:26:02,340
Okay, this is the play room.

5372
05:26:02,340 --> 05:26:03,380
So it's gonna stay like this.

5373
05:26:03,380 --> 05:26:04,259
This is okay.

5374
05:26:04,259 --> 05:26:07,319
There's no food.

5375
05:26:07,319 --> 05:26:08,439
It's just too much food.

5376
05:26:08,439 --> 05:26:10,279
Well, they'll go get the food down there.

5377
05:26:10,279 --> 05:26:18,200
Play room, sleep room, memorial, cafeteria.

5378
05:26:18,200 --> 05:26:19,819
What should this be?

5379
05:26:19,819 --> 05:26:25,319
What should this be?

5380
05:26:28,310 --> 05:26:29,029
Is a tree in the way?

5381
05:26:31,180 --> 05:26:37,930
Make this the anti-gravity room.

5382
05:26:37,930 --> 05:26:38,250
Okay.

5383
05:26:38,810 --> 05:26:40,169
No, I don't want to do that.

5384
05:26:40,169 --> 05:26:40,970
That sounds horrible.

5385
05:26:41,689 --> 05:26:43,689
Make it space because it's an anti-gravity room.

5386
05:26:53,000 --> 05:26:55,990
And then this will be the garden.

5387
05:26:55,990 --> 05:26:58,459
This is the garden.

5388
05:26:58,459 --> 05:27:04,729
Perfect.

5389
05:27:04,729 --> 05:27:06,779
All right.

5390
05:27:06,779 --> 05:27:08,619
Switch the food in the memorial room.

5391
05:27:08,619 --> 05:27:12,180
That's a good point.

5392
05:27:12,180 --> 05:27:14,299
That's a good point.

5393
05:27:14,299 --> 05:27:15,099
Yeah, that's a good point.

5394
05:27:15,099 --> 05:27:16,060
So I don't have to go as far.

5395
05:27:16,860 --> 05:27:17,340
Good point.

5396
05:27:38,970 --> 05:27:45,580
Those still exist, right?

5397
05:27:45,580 --> 05:28:09,639
Oh, I'm playing chess while the game's playing checkers.

5398
05:28:09,639 --> 05:28:11,319
Like what the fuck am I doing?

5399
05:28:11,319 --> 05:28:19,580
Although, do those still exist?

5400
05:28:19,580 --> 05:28:21,180
The memorials exist, right?

5401
05:28:21,180 --> 05:28:24,200
They're not gone, are they?

5402
05:28:24,200 --> 05:28:25,000
They better be.

5403
05:28:25,000 --> 05:28:29,209
I think they're still there.

5404
05:28:29,209 --> 05:28:29,930
People are hungry.

5405
05:28:29,930 --> 05:28:30,409
All right.

5406
05:28:30,409 --> 05:28:31,450
Come on, come on, come on.

5407
05:28:31,450 --> 05:28:32,490
There's nothing there.

5408
05:28:32,490 --> 05:28:53,459
Arm is killing me.

5409
05:28:53,459 --> 05:28:55,270
Why am I so fucked up today?

5410
05:28:55,270 --> 05:28:56,709
I don't know what the fuck is happening to me.

5411
05:28:56,709 --> 05:29:12,040
That's fine.

5412
05:29:14,569 --> 05:29:22,630
He's falling apart.

5413
05:29:22,630 --> 05:29:23,509
Get nice and cool in here.

5414
05:29:23,509 --> 05:29:23,830
Okay.

5415
05:29:23,830 --> 05:29:24,389
All right.

5416
05:29:24,389 --> 05:29:25,029
Now they can eat.

5417
05:29:25,029 --> 05:29:25,750
They can get food.

5418
05:29:25,750 --> 05:29:31,540
And now let's put the memorial stuff down here.

5419
05:29:31,540 --> 05:29:46,360
Thank goodness.

5420
05:29:46,360 --> 05:29:46,759
Sag.

5421
05:29:47,990 --> 05:29:48,229
I don't know.

5422
05:29:48,229 --> 05:29:50,090
Maybe I am getting sick.

5423
05:29:50,090 --> 05:29:51,450
I don't think I am.

5424
05:29:51,450 --> 05:29:53,299
That'd be kind of annoying if I was.

5425
05:29:59,509 --> 05:30:00,549
Let me clean this up.

5426
05:30:00,549 --> 05:30:10,470
Get a tree in here.

5427
05:30:10,470 --> 05:30:18,040
This dude's farming his sagges.

5428
05:30:18,040 --> 05:30:19,639
Oh, I don't think I feel good.

5429
05:30:19,639 --> 05:30:20,840
Um, I don't feel good.

5430
05:30:22,119 --> 05:30:27,259
The dogs are starving.

5431
05:30:27,259 --> 05:30:31,639
You're right.

5432
05:30:31,639 --> 05:30:31,959
All right.

5433
05:30:31,959 --> 05:30:33,799
Food, food, food, food, food.

5434
05:30:33,799 --> 05:30:35,240
Food, food, food.

5435
05:30:35,240 --> 05:30:37,509
Everyone's starving.

5436
05:30:37,509 --> 05:30:40,099
Oh, oh my god.

5437
05:30:40,099 --> 05:30:45,349
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up.

5438
05:30:45,349 --> 05:30:47,990
Tipsy, tipsy, tipsy, tipsy, tipsy, tipsy, tipsy.

5439
05:30:47,990 --> 05:30:48,310
What do you want?

5440
05:30:48,310 --> 05:30:48,630
What do you want?

5441
05:30:48,630 --> 05:30:55,479
Lasagna, lasagna, lasagna, lasagna.

5442
05:30:55,479 --> 05:30:56,200
Right there, right there.

5443
05:30:56,200 --> 05:30:57,479
It's eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat.

5444
05:30:57,479 --> 05:31:03,110
Okay.

5445
05:31:03,110 --> 05:31:04,630
I forgot the game doesn't pause.

5446
05:31:04,630 --> 05:31:05,270
Okay.

5447
05:31:05,270 --> 05:31:09,509
Because I've, it's, you're okay.

5448
05:31:09,509 --> 05:31:13,479
Okay, back, you can go back to sleep.

5449
05:31:13,479 --> 05:31:14,200
Very good.

5450
05:31:14,200 --> 05:31:28,759
Think of that we got corn dogs in the corner here.

5451
05:31:28,759 --> 05:31:29,720
They're fine.

5452
05:31:29,720 --> 05:31:45,560
They've got, seriously, they got corn dogs.

5453
05:31:45,560 --> 05:32:05,459
Just taking much more effort.

5454
05:32:05,459 --> 05:32:12,119
Okay, cool.

5455
05:32:12,119 --> 05:32:13,509
What we got?

5456
05:32:13,509 --> 05:32:20,169
I think, uh, brunch grew a lot.

5457
05:32:20,169 --> 05:32:28,520
There's a little base now.

5458
05:32:28,520 --> 05:32:32,040
Snout rotation minus 30 percent.

5459
05:32:32,040 --> 05:32:34,950
Courage is dying.

5460
05:32:34,950 --> 05:32:40,580
That don't look like dying to me.

5461
05:32:40,580 --> 05:32:43,860
That looks like having a great time.

5462
05:32:43,860 --> 05:32:55,270
They have a corn dog.

5463
05:32:55,270 --> 05:32:55,909
Dying.

5464
05:32:55,909 --> 05:33:26,779
That's not dying.

5465
05:33:26,779 --> 05:33:33,319
Ooh, coke got a lot darker.

5466
05:33:33,319 --> 05:33:37,000
Interesting.

5467
05:33:37,000 --> 05:33:40,680
17 percent taller.

5468
05:33:40,680 --> 05:33:41,080
Very cool.

5469
05:33:47,049 --> 05:33:53,459
Courage and storage so they don't die.

5470
05:33:53,459 --> 05:33:55,700
Pattern metallic plus 20 percent.

5471
05:33:55,700 --> 05:33:58,169
What's that mean?

5472
05:33:58,169 --> 05:33:58,810
Shinier?

5473
05:33:58,810 --> 05:34:07,270
What does metallic pattern mean?

5474
05:34:07,270 --> 05:34:09,349
This motivated me to sit with my dog.

5475
05:34:09,349 --> 05:34:10,150
Oh, that's cute.

5476
05:34:10,150 --> 05:34:29,979
Tipsy, you want to play?

5477
05:34:29,979 --> 05:34:30,779
Good throw.

5478
05:34:30,779 --> 05:34:32,009
Nice job.

5479
05:34:35,029 --> 05:34:36,630
Okay, french fries for tipsy, right?

5480
05:34:36,630 --> 05:35:03,939
A little bit more body length and we'll be fine.

5481
05:35:03,939 --> 05:35:11,029
What the fuck is going on?

5482
05:35:11,029 --> 05:35:19,500
I, you need to go to sleep.

5483
05:35:19,500 --> 05:35:21,180
Somewhere comfortable in the corner so you don't,

5484
05:35:21,180 --> 05:35:23,830
I don't want you to get beat up or anything.

5485
05:35:23,830 --> 05:35:25,750
Under the AC?

5486
05:35:25,750 --> 05:35:26,630
Yeah, right here.

5487
05:35:26,630 --> 05:35:28,790
There you go.

5488
05:35:28,790 --> 05:35:31,529
Get some sleep.

5489
05:35:31,529 --> 05:35:31,930
It's okay.

5490
05:35:31,930 --> 05:35:32,250
That's all right.

5491
05:35:32,250 --> 05:35:32,650
All right.

5492
05:35:32,650 --> 05:35:33,849
Right in front of the AC.

5493
05:35:33,849 --> 05:35:39,220
Nice and cool.

5494
05:35:39,220 --> 05:35:40,099
I love tipsy.

5495
05:35:40,099 --> 05:35:41,380
Tipsy is amazing.

5496
05:35:41,380 --> 05:35:48,810
Courage is ancient.

5497
05:35:49,959 --> 05:35:51,159
Maybe it is time to store courage.

5498
05:35:53,130 --> 05:35:54,090
Yeah, I'll do it.

5499
05:35:54,090 --> 05:36:04,790
I don't want to lose them.

5500
05:36:04,790 --> 05:36:05,909
Make a wind vortex.

5501
05:36:05,909 --> 05:36:06,869
Oh, I was gonna make the uh,

5502
05:36:06,869 --> 05:36:08,389
okay, everyone seems to be okay now.

5503
05:36:08,389 --> 05:36:12,470
This is the anti-gravity room, right?

5504
05:36:12,470 --> 05:36:13,110
Yeah.

5505
05:36:13,110 --> 05:36:32,919
Mars or should I just do anti-gravity?

5506
05:36:32,919 --> 05:36:47,139
Is this fun?

5507
05:36:47,139 --> 05:36:48,680
Do they think this is fun?

5508
05:36:48,680 --> 05:37:02,490
I think that, I think they're having a good time.

5509
05:37:02,490 --> 05:37:06,119
Send tipsy's hanging out having a good time.

5510
05:37:06,119 --> 05:37:18,180
No, another french fry and I think we'll have enough length for tipsy to be able to

5511
05:37:20,069 --> 05:37:21,110
really just kind of move around.

5512
05:37:21,110 --> 05:37:21,909
I think it should be fine.

5513
05:37:22,470 --> 05:37:24,790
Very tipsy.

5514
05:37:24,790 --> 05:37:33,049
I have one of these.

5515
05:37:33,049 --> 05:37:37,909
There you go.

5516
05:37:37,909 --> 05:37:39,669
Food in this game is making me hungry.

5517
05:37:39,669 --> 05:37:40,790
I'm getting hungry too.

5518
05:37:40,790 --> 05:37:41,349
What time is it?

5519
05:37:41,990 --> 05:37:46,099
Yeah, end of the stream voice coming up here in a minute.

5520
05:37:46,979 --> 05:37:49,860
I'm gonna get some food and I'm gonna try to figure out what the hell's going on in here.

5521
05:37:52,139 --> 05:37:53,880
It's way strong.

5522
05:37:53,880 --> 05:37:54,279
All right.

5523
05:37:54,279 --> 05:37:57,000
Way stronger than like an hour ago.

5524
05:37:57,000 --> 05:38:03,029
Like I said, five to ten percent more body length than I think it's perfect.

5525
05:38:03,029 --> 05:38:04,310
I think it's gonna be fine.

5526
05:38:04,310 --> 05:38:05,799
I'll show you.

5527
05:38:05,799 --> 05:38:06,680
It's not my sinuses.

5528
05:38:06,680 --> 05:38:09,639
It's like back like here like in here.

5529
05:38:09,639 --> 05:38:10,360
It's really weird.

5530
05:38:12,069 --> 05:38:13,270
I'm sorry about that.

5531
05:38:13,270 --> 05:38:16,790
I didn't think I was gonna be like a fucking chain smoker today.

5532
05:38:19,299 --> 05:38:20,869
This is my tonsils.

5533
05:38:21,590 --> 05:38:22,069
It's like deeper.

5534
05:38:22,069 --> 05:38:22,709
It's like down here.

5535
05:38:23,270 --> 05:38:23,909
Like in here.

5536
05:38:24,630 --> 05:38:33,020
Take a nap over here maybe.

5537
05:38:33,659 --> 05:38:39,860
Yeah, this is a lot more walking than tipsy's done.

5538
05:38:39,860 --> 05:38:41,619
So this is the I'm actually happy about this.

5539
05:38:42,259 --> 05:38:49,619
That body length was really bad before but now oh there we go.

5540
05:38:49,619 --> 05:38:50,099
Hell yeah.

5541
05:38:51,060 --> 05:38:51,380
Yes.

5542
05:38:52,419 --> 05:38:52,740
Yes.

5543
05:38:54,650 --> 05:38:54,889
Yes.

5544
05:38:55,529 --> 05:39:04,090
Play with the ball.

5545
05:39:04,090 --> 05:39:10,840
Spongy play with the ball.

5546
05:39:10,840 --> 05:39:11,639
Why ain't I playing with the ball?

5547
05:39:14,090 --> 05:39:17,159
Good throw.

5548
05:39:17,159 --> 05:39:18,119
That was a great throw.

5549
05:39:25,130 --> 05:39:27,209
Wait, that's the anti-gravity chamber?

5550
05:39:27,209 --> 05:39:33,740
Where did where did tipsy go?

5551
05:39:33,740 --> 05:39:38,069
Where's tipsy?

5552
05:39:38,630 --> 05:39:41,880
Oh, there we go.

5553
05:39:41,880 --> 05:39:45,080
Look at how happy tipsy is being able to move around.

5554
05:39:45,080 --> 05:39:48,540
This is great.

5555
05:39:50,009 --> 05:39:52,569
Actually what are as aggressive actually great development.

5556
05:39:53,619 --> 05:39:54,099
Look at that.

5557
05:39:59,610 --> 05:39:59,930
Yes.

5558
05:40:00,729 --> 05:40:01,770
It actually makes me really happy.

5559
05:40:01,770 --> 05:40:02,970
That's like I'm glad.

5560
05:40:03,610 --> 05:40:05,509
All right.

5561
05:40:05,509 --> 05:40:06,310
Be careful.

5562
05:40:14,119 --> 05:40:15,159
Look they're having fun.

5563
05:40:17,220 --> 05:40:17,619
Yes.

5564
05:40:18,419 --> 05:40:22,819
We've got a good ending.

5565
05:40:22,819 --> 05:40:25,099
I'm curious with another evolution though.

5566
05:40:30,759 --> 05:40:31,880
This is a cute game.

5567
05:40:31,880 --> 05:40:33,000
How much is this game?

5568
05:40:33,000 --> 05:40:36,150
This is really fun.

5569
05:40:36,150 --> 05:40:37,110
This is just like chill.

5570
05:40:37,110 --> 05:40:37,590
I loved it.

5571
05:40:38,229 --> 05:40:41,380
It's 20 bucks.

5572
05:40:41,380 --> 05:40:42,869
Yeah.

5573
05:40:42,869 --> 05:40:43,509
This is really cute.

5574
05:40:49,130 --> 05:40:49,770
Oh look it.

5575
05:40:52,360 --> 05:40:58,310
Go go go go go go go.

5576
05:40:58,310 --> 05:40:59,509
They're both doing so well.

5577
05:41:01,290 --> 05:41:02,169
Yeah.

5578
05:41:02,169 --> 05:41:02,569
Perfect.

5579
05:41:09,459 --> 05:41:10,180
All right.

5580
05:41:10,180 --> 05:41:10,500
Okay.

5581
05:41:10,500 --> 05:41:11,139
Ready to relax.

5582
05:41:11,139 --> 05:41:11,779
No more music.

5583
05:41:12,419 --> 05:41:13,849
Let's get some food.

5584
05:41:14,409 --> 05:41:16,090
Snoopy I don't know.

5585
05:41:16,090 --> 05:41:17,209
I think you're like stuck in here.

5586
05:41:20,180 --> 05:41:21,220
Snoopy be careful.

5587
05:41:21,220 --> 05:41:22,580
I wouldn't go in that room.

5588
05:41:22,580 --> 05:41:26,040
Okay.

5589
05:41:26,040 --> 05:41:26,439
You're fine.

5590
05:41:27,000 --> 05:41:29,619
Is there any food?

5591
05:41:29,619 --> 05:41:29,860
All right.

5592
05:41:29,860 --> 05:41:30,979
There's a pizza bagel over here.

5593
05:41:30,979 --> 05:41:31,540
You can eat that.

5594
05:41:32,979 --> 05:41:34,259
Eat this pizza bagel.

5595
05:41:34,259 --> 05:41:34,740
There you go.

5596
05:41:42,580 --> 05:41:44,869
Eww.

5597
05:41:44,869 --> 05:41:45,270
Uh okay.

5598
05:41:45,270 --> 05:41:46,709
You need to go this way to get some food.

5599
05:41:48,009 --> 05:42:02,650
All right.

5600
05:42:02,650 --> 05:42:03,290
Snack time.

5601
05:42:05,000 --> 05:42:06,360
How about a moon cheese?

5602
05:42:06,360 --> 05:42:06,919
That sounds good.

5603
05:42:07,560 --> 05:42:18,069
What else is hungry?

5604
05:42:18,069 --> 05:42:18,310
You?

5605
05:42:18,310 --> 05:42:18,549
All right.

5606
05:42:18,549 --> 05:42:19,349
What do you what do you like?

5607
05:42:19,349 --> 05:42:19,990
What are you looking for?

5608
05:42:20,630 --> 05:42:21,750
How about a lasagna?

5609
05:42:22,310 --> 05:42:23,270
Oh you want a candy apple.

5610
05:42:23,270 --> 05:42:23,509
Okay.

5611
05:42:23,509 --> 05:42:23,830
Sure.

5612
05:42:23,830 --> 05:42:24,150
Take it.

5613
05:42:26,250 --> 05:42:26,889
That's what they wanted.

5614
05:42:26,889 --> 05:42:28,729
I need it.

5615
05:42:30,680 --> 05:42:32,709
Okay.

5616
05:42:32,709 --> 05:42:33,509
All right.

5617
05:42:33,509 --> 05:42:33,830
All right.

5618
05:42:33,830 --> 05:42:34,389
I think that's it.

5619
05:42:35,130 --> 05:42:35,689
I think that's it.

5620
05:42:36,330 --> 05:42:36,830
Okay.

5621
05:42:37,529 --> 05:42:38,939
Do one more evolution.

5622
05:42:39,659 --> 05:42:44,409
Tipsy and brunch.

5623
05:42:44,409 --> 05:42:47,240
I don't think brunch is old enough.

5624
05:42:47,240 --> 05:42:49,080
Brunch is not old enough.

5625
05:42:49,080 --> 05:42:50,380
Not yet.

5626
05:42:50,939 --> 05:42:53,610
One more.

5627
05:42:53,610 --> 05:42:54,090
All right.

5628
05:42:54,090 --> 05:42:56,169
When we'll do brunch and tipsy.

5629
05:42:56,169 --> 05:43:01,770
I'll let I'll do that happen before I go.

5630
05:43:01,770 --> 05:43:06,169
The next stream we're going to do a Mon Bazao which is like a car game.

5631
05:43:06,970 --> 05:43:10,520
It's kind of like my summer car and long drive combined.

5632
05:43:12,659 --> 05:43:14,340
I can't tell you we're doing that tomorrow though

5633
05:43:14,340 --> 05:43:18,759
because I think I'm going to take a day to figure out what's going on here.

5634
05:43:18,759 --> 05:43:22,700
That's a car game.

5635
05:43:25,750 --> 05:43:27,029
You come here.

5636
05:43:27,029 --> 05:43:31,240
I might be sick.

5637
05:43:31,240 --> 05:43:32,680
Well if I'm sick then uh then I'm sick.

5638
05:43:32,680 --> 05:43:33,000
Whatever.

5639
05:43:33,000 --> 05:43:38,380
I'll figure it out.

5640
05:43:38,380 --> 05:43:39,020
I'll figure it out.

5641
05:43:43,020 --> 05:43:44,540
I don't think that's the case.

5642
05:43:44,540 --> 05:43:46,540
I think it's like some kind of environmental change or something.

5643
05:43:46,540 --> 05:43:46,860
I don't know.

5644
05:43:46,860 --> 05:43:50,020
I gotta see what happens tomorrow.

5645
05:43:50,580 --> 05:43:53,770
Oh a picket fence.

5646
05:43:53,770 --> 05:43:55,290
We're just hanging out in here.

5647
05:43:58,900 --> 05:43:59,779
Tipsy needs food.

5648
05:43:59,779 --> 05:44:00,419
I'll bring something.

5649
05:44:00,979 --> 05:44:02,740
What is tipsy's favorite food?

5650
05:44:02,740 --> 05:44:03,720
Because I'm going to bring it.

5651
05:44:06,779 --> 05:44:22,330
It's definitely like a pancake or something.

5652
05:44:22,330 --> 05:44:24,250
Oh shit they dug they dug some more.

5653
05:44:24,250 --> 05:44:25,049
Cool.

5654
05:44:25,049 --> 05:44:27,060
All right tipsy come on up.

5655
05:44:27,779 --> 05:44:28,580
I didn't want to do that.

5656
05:44:28,580 --> 05:44:29,060
I'm sorry.

5657
05:44:29,700 --> 05:44:30,580
How do I get you to come out?

5658
05:44:35,799 --> 05:44:45,639
No fuck I didn't I didn't I'm not I didn't mean to do that.

5659
05:44:45,639 --> 05:44:48,549
Oh here we go here we go.

5660
05:44:48,549 --> 05:44:52,380
This is um we have some mutations here.

5661
05:45:17,990 --> 05:45:19,349
I need tipsy to come out.

5662
05:45:19,349 --> 05:45:23,720
See can you come out please?

5663
05:45:23,720 --> 05:45:32,279
Come on up.

5664
05:45:32,279 --> 05:45:33,479
Oh my god.

5665
05:45:33,479 --> 05:45:35,159
I need a lasagna instead.

5666
05:45:35,159 --> 05:45:43,349
There you go.

5667
05:45:44,229 --> 05:45:49,479
Stop.

5668
05:45:50,279 --> 05:46:17,299
Eat this pancake.

5669
05:46:17,299 --> 05:46:29,099
Can you not eat the pancake?

5670
05:46:29,099 --> 05:46:31,020
Get out of the zero gravity room.

5671
05:46:33,220 --> 05:47:04,180
Okay now you need to go to sleep right now.

5672
05:47:04,180 --> 05:47:04,819
Very cool.

5673
05:47:04,819 --> 05:47:05,540
Let's see what we got.

5674
05:47:07,380 --> 05:47:11,700
Do the voice before your throat explodes.

5675
05:47:11,700 --> 05:47:12,340
What voice?

5676
05:47:12,340 --> 05:47:20,360
Head got a little bigger.

5677
05:47:20,360 --> 05:47:29,290
Probably good for balance.

5678
05:47:29,290 --> 05:47:34,619
Ooh the spots change.

5679
05:47:34,619 --> 05:47:41,860
The spots look like look different.

5680
05:47:41,860 --> 05:47:45,540
TikTok voice.

5681
05:47:45,540 --> 05:47:47,380
You want me to do the TikTok voice again?

5682
05:47:57,979 --> 05:48:02,979
Do the Coachella voice.

5683
05:48:02,979 --> 05:48:03,779
That's cool.

5684
05:48:03,779 --> 05:48:10,419
Is that good for your throat though?

5685
05:48:10,419 --> 05:48:14,099
Um it's kind of like going in and out if you noticed.

5686
05:48:14,099 --> 05:48:20,970
It's like sometimes it's like and then sometimes it's like it's okay.

5687
05:48:20,970 --> 05:48:26,250
Bigger head and more metallic.

5688
05:48:26,250 --> 05:48:34,840
I don't notice the metallic though.

5689
05:48:34,840 --> 05:48:36,360
Tipsy's body got short again.

5690
05:48:36,360 --> 05:48:36,919
What?

5691
05:48:36,919 --> 05:48:44,220
Oh no it did.

5692
05:48:44,220 --> 05:48:45,849
What happened?

5693
05:48:45,849 --> 05:48:46,569
What happened?

5694
05:48:46,569 --> 05:48:49,500
What happened?

5695
05:48:49,500 --> 05:48:51,029
What the heck?

5696
05:48:51,029 --> 05:48:51,909
What the f-

5697
05:48:51,909 --> 05:48:57,180
Really?

5698
05:48:57,180 --> 05:49:04,220
What happened there?

5699
05:49:04,220 --> 05:49:05,659
Uh Tipsy and-

5700
05:49:05,659 --> 05:49:06,840
Not Snoopy.

5701
05:49:06,840 --> 05:49:07,479
Who was it?

5702
05:49:07,479 --> 05:49:09,419
Who is it?

5703
05:49:10,139 --> 05:49:10,939
Who was it?

5704
05:49:10,939 --> 05:49:13,060
Oh they're not old enough.

5705
05:49:13,060 --> 05:49:20,229
They're not old enough yet.

5706
05:49:20,229 --> 05:49:20,790
It wasn't-

5707
05:49:20,790 --> 05:49:21,509
No it wasn't Proto.

5708
05:49:21,509 --> 05:49:22,630
It was one of the spots.

5709
05:49:22,630 --> 05:49:23,430
It was one of these.

5710
05:49:23,430 --> 05:49:25,110
It's Brunch.

5711
05:49:25,110 --> 05:49:26,840
Not old enough.

5712
05:49:26,840 --> 05:49:34,680
Oh no Tipsy's a wedge again.

5713
05:49:34,680 --> 05:49:41,029
Uh what's going on with the nose?

5714
05:49:41,029 --> 05:49:50,819
Did Tipsy's head get bigger?

5715
05:49:50,819 --> 05:50:06,729
I think Tipsy's head is bigger.

5716
05:50:06,729 --> 05:50:08,659
Okay all right.

5717
05:50:09,299 --> 05:50:11,750
I'm gonna save it here in case I play again.

5718
05:50:11,750 --> 05:50:12,549
That was fun.

5719
05:50:12,549 --> 05:50:13,509
That was really cute.

5720
05:50:13,509 --> 05:50:14,970
I was a big fan.

5721
05:50:19,189 --> 05:50:24,409
This is how-

5722
05:50:24,409 --> 05:50:25,369
I'm definitely gonna save this

5723
05:50:25,369 --> 05:50:26,650
because I don't know I might play again.

5724
05:50:26,650 --> 05:50:30,459
Although I said that about everything.

5725
05:50:34,729 --> 05:50:36,490
I did not think I was gonna play this for six hours

5726
05:50:36,490 --> 05:50:39,130
but that was really cool.

5727
05:50:39,130 --> 05:50:40,729
I'm supposed to stream tomorrow

5728
05:50:40,729 --> 05:50:42,939
but I-

5729
05:50:42,939 --> 05:50:43,580
I don't know.

5730
05:50:43,580 --> 05:50:44,139
I might not.

5731
05:50:45,270 --> 05:50:49,159
So tentatively I would just say

5732
05:50:49,159 --> 05:50:51,319
prepare for today's Tuesday.

5733
05:50:51,319 --> 05:50:55,419
I just prepare for uh prepare for Thursday

5734
05:50:55,419 --> 05:50:58,380
and if tomorrow I get up and I'm fine

5735
05:50:58,380 --> 05:50:59,020
I'll just go tomorrow.

5736
05:51:00,470 --> 05:51:02,150
But if not then we'll go on Thursday.

5737
05:51:02,709 --> 05:51:04,340
So just plan for Thursday

5738
05:51:04,340 --> 05:51:05,060
but don't-

5739
05:51:05,060 --> 05:51:08,180
Don't be surprised if you see me tomorrow.

5740
05:51:08,180 --> 05:51:11,830
This is really fun.

5741
05:51:11,830 --> 05:51:12,630
This is a really cool game.

5742
05:51:14,470 --> 05:51:19,419
I'm-

5743
05:51:19,419 --> 05:51:20,779
I hope I'm not getting sick.

5744
05:51:20,779 --> 05:51:21,580
I really hope not.

5745
05:51:22,950 --> 05:51:23,830
So see you Friday.

5746
05:51:23,830 --> 05:51:24,630
So see you Saturday.

5747
05:51:24,630 --> 05:51:25,590
No that-

5748
05:51:25,590 --> 05:51:26,549
I don't know yet.

5749
05:51:26,549 --> 05:51:27,830
I don't know yet.

5750
05:51:27,830 --> 05:51:30,470
Can we get a fit check?

5751
05:51:32,380 --> 05:51:34,060
Checking out my Coachella fit check.

5752
05:51:37,349 --> 05:51:38,310
What do you guys think?

5753
05:51:39,259 --> 05:51:40,299
I think it's at least-

5754
05:51:41,099 --> 05:51:42,540
At least a five out of five.

5755
05:51:50,330 --> 05:51:50,970
Stay healthy?

5756
05:51:50,970 --> 05:51:51,610
I'm- I am.

5757
05:51:51,610 --> 05:51:51,930
Don't worry.

5758
05:51:51,930 --> 05:51:54,340
I'll be okay.

5759
05:51:54,340 --> 05:51:55,220
Please stop that.

5760
05:51:57,060 --> 05:51:57,939
See you in July.

5761
05:51:57,939 --> 05:51:58,340
I'm not-

5762
05:51:58,340 --> 05:51:58,740
I hope-

5763
05:51:58,740 --> 05:52:00,020
No I will see you in July.

5764
05:52:00,020 --> 05:52:00,500
You're right.

5765
05:52:00,500 --> 05:52:01,860
Because uh July 14th.

5766
05:52:02,419 --> 05:52:04,500
Make sure you check out on July 14th.

5767
05:52:05,060 --> 05:52:08,040
July 14th is gonna be the baseball stream.

5768
05:52:08,040 --> 05:52:09,639
You're not gonna wanna miss it.

5769
05:52:09,639 --> 05:52:11,540
Trust me on that.

5770
05:52:11,540 --> 05:52:13,299
Gonna have all kinds of festivities.

5771
05:52:13,299 --> 05:52:15,740
All kinds of cool stuff.

5772
05:52:15,740 --> 05:52:17,580
You're not gonna wanna miss it.

5773
05:52:17,580 --> 05:52:18,139
Trust me.

5774
05:52:21,430 --> 05:52:22,790
And I'm telling you.

5775
05:52:22,790 --> 05:52:24,700
Take a burrito.

5776
05:52:24,700 --> 05:52:26,380
Put cheese on top of it.

5777
05:52:26,380 --> 05:52:28,299
And wrap it in another burrito.

5778
05:52:28,299 --> 05:52:35,130
Boston.

5779
05:52:35,130 --> 05:52:40,299
See you later.

5780
05:52:40,299 --> 05:52:41,020
Oh what's that?

5781
05:52:41,020 --> 05:52:42,060
Oh how many-

5782
05:52:42,060 --> 05:52:43,659
How many minus twos do I see?

5783
05:52:43,659 --> 05:52:45,060
Huh?

5784
05:52:45,060 --> 05:52:46,099
Oh hold on a minute there.

5785
05:52:46,099 --> 05:52:46,819
I can't really-

5786
05:52:46,819 --> 05:52:47,860
I can't really see that well.

5787
05:52:57,430 --> 05:52:58,229
Yeah I'll-

5788
05:52:58,229 --> 05:52:59,029
Playing for Thursday.

5789
05:52:59,029 --> 05:53:00,470
I'll see you maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe.

5790
05:53:00,470 --> 05:53:02,310
Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe.

5791
05:53:02,310 --> 05:53:06,229
Alright goodnight guys.

5792
05:53:06,229 --> 05:53:06,549
Been fun.

5793
05:53:06,549 --> 05:53:07,590
This game is actually really cool.

5794
05:53:07,590 --> 05:53:08,549
I recommend it.

5795
05:53:08,549 --> 05:53:09,750
If you haven't played it I recommend it.

5796
05:53:09,750 --> 05:53:10,389
Go check it out.

5797
05:53:13,880 --> 05:53:14,439
Minus two.

5798
05:53:14,439 --> 05:53:15,319
Quiet old man.

5799
05:53:15,959 --> 05:53:19,319
I feel like I'm playing Sekiro again.

5800
05:53:19,319 --> 05:53:21,720
Remember Sekiro?

5801
05:53:21,720 --> 05:53:23,479
If you go watch the Sekiro VODs like my-

5802
05:53:23,479 --> 05:53:25,479
The whole time I was playing Sekiro I sounded like this.

5803
05:53:26,680 --> 05:53:27,639
Actually way worse than this.

5804
05:53:27,639 --> 05:53:28,439
Like a hundred times worse.

5805
05:53:31,430 --> 05:53:32,790
Alright I'll see you guys later.

5806
05:53:32,790 --> 05:53:44,580
It's been a long time since I've been like quote sick on stream.

5807
05:53:44,580 --> 05:53:45,700
It's been a very long time.

5808
05:53:46,259 --> 05:53:51,860
It's been at least a couple of-

5809
05:53:51,860 --> 05:53:53,700
I think that's the last time that happened.

5810
05:53:54,340 --> 05:54:02,069
I hate getting sick.

5811
05:54:02,069 --> 05:54:02,549
I hate it.

5812
05:54:02,549 --> 05:54:03,430
I hope it's not happening.

5813
05:54:03,430 --> 05:54:04,150
I gotta stop yelling.

5814
05:54:04,150 --> 05:54:04,709
No more yelling.

5815
05:54:06,150 --> 05:54:09,669
Hope your TikTok voice doesn't get worse.

5816
05:54:09,669 --> 05:54:10,549
So thanks for the stream.

5817
05:54:10,549 --> 05:54:11,990
Yeah thanks for watching.

5818
05:54:11,990 --> 05:54:14,970
Take care of yourselves.

5819
05:54:14,970 --> 05:54:17,049
Have a good rest of your kind of mid-week here.

5820
05:54:23,369 --> 05:54:26,409
Has it gotten worse or has it been about exactly the same since the stream started?

5821
05:54:26,409 --> 05:54:27,529
It's kind of hard to tell.

5822
05:54:27,529 --> 05:54:30,169
I feel like it's kind of going in and out.

5823
05:54:30,169 --> 05:54:34,279
I feel like it's fine but not.

5824
05:54:34,279 --> 05:54:34,759
Is it worse?

5825
05:54:39,700 --> 05:54:48,939
Yeah well.

5826
05:54:48,939 --> 05:54:53,639
I'll shut up.

5827
05:54:53,639 --> 05:54:54,520
I will shut up.

5828
05:54:55,159 --> 05:55:01,590
Drink some water.

5829
05:55:01,590 --> 05:55:02,310
I'll drink some water.

5830
05:55:07,340 --> 05:55:08,619
You need to keep talking.

5831
05:55:16,439 --> 05:55:17,159
Let's do a raid.

5832
05:55:18,279 --> 05:55:19,400
Let's raid.

5833
05:55:19,400 --> 05:55:19,880
Let's see.

5834
05:55:23,500 --> 05:55:24,139
Let's raid.

5835
05:55:24,139 --> 05:55:25,689
Let's raid Atriarch.

5836
05:55:25,689 --> 05:55:27,689
It's Atriarch's birthday today.

5837
05:55:27,689 --> 05:55:31,180
I just figured that out right now because I saw it right here.

5838
05:55:31,180 --> 05:55:34,360
Happy birthday to Atriarch.

5839
05:55:34,360 --> 05:55:35,560
It's Atriarch's birthday.

5840
05:55:35,560 --> 05:55:37,319
I want you to go say happy birthday.

5841
05:55:37,319 --> 05:55:40,419
I'm gonna be fucking pissed.

5842
05:55:48,840 --> 05:55:50,279
Have a wonderful rest of your evening.

5843
05:55:50,279 --> 05:55:50,759
Goodbye.

5844
05:55:50,759 --> 05:55:53,180
Sorry that the wrote stuff is annoying.

5845
05:55:54,299 --> 05:55:56,979
I probably sounded irritating this whole time.

5846
05:55:56,979 --> 05:55:57,619
I can imagine.

5847
05:55:59,000 --> 05:55:59,880
But we'll see you soon.

5848
05:55:59,880 --> 05:56:01,000
In the next day or two.

5849
05:56:01,000 --> 05:56:01,720
Have a great night.

5850
05:56:02,360 --> 05:56:04,599
Go say happy birthday to Atriarch.

5851
05:56:11,430 --> 05:57:51,830
And good night.
