00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,500
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with some more Call of Duty Black Ops 2.

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:22,500
Now, this is the Zombies mode in Black Ops 2. This actually was very heavily requested that I do this, especially on Transit and especially by myself.

3
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,500
So this is a solo run. I'm gonna do the Transit mode like you're seeing, and I have no idea what's going on, by the way.

4
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:34,679
This is the first time I've ever, ever played Call of Duty Black Ops Zombies, ever. Never. Never done this, never.

5
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:39,679
So I have no idea what's gonna happen. All I know is I'm supposed to shoot these zombies, and when.

6
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:46,799
So we're gonna go with that. I don't know what to do. I've seen a couple videos on that. What the hell is that?

7
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:51,219
What? What, there's like power-ups in this mode? Cool.

8
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:58,469
Probably have limited ammo. I probably shouldn't just be shooting like six bullets at a time, but let's hope I don't screw this up.

9
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:05,290
Black Ops 2 zombies! Whatever this is, I'm buying it. Sweet.

10
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:10,859
So now what, we just like wait around and just like sit around? Whatever, I can do that.

11
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:16,159
Oh, power-up's running out. Power-up's running out. I gotta find somebody to shoot. Power-up! Oh, my power-up's blinking.

12
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,530
Blinking like an old Super Nintendo boss.

13
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:28,340
Well, come on in. Come on in, Joppies. There's a one-head shot.

14
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:44,060
What? What? That's it? I just lost. I just lost. I just lost right there. I got hit. Oh my god, that was terrible.

15
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,659
Oh, rebuild. Rebuild. Make sure there's nobody behind me, man.

16
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:54,019
I feel like I'm playing The Sims. It's like the same buying noise.

17
00:01:55,019 --> 00:02:02,180
You buy like a sofa. All right, am I missing something here or no? It's just slow at first.

18
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:13,889
Anybody else out here? Which one of you zombie bricks want to take it to the face? Rebuild.

19
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:17,889
No! No! What? No! You put it where it didn't even come from!

20
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:22,580
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

21
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:37,530
Jeopardy Baby Beatbox Edition. Where are the enemies? Oh, cool. You spawned like an enemy.

22
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:42,990
Oh, you're on fire. All right. I'm going to change position here.

23
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:48,419
Oh, what? What? This lady just came out of nowhere. Do they spawn behind you?

24
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:55,479
They spawn behind you! I'm going to lose! I'm going to lose on fire!

25
00:02:55,479 --> 00:03:02,550
No! Wait! Wait! Time out! Grenade! Oh, eat grenades! Everybody eat a grenade!

26
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:05,979
Oh, Jesus! I'm still alive!

27
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,740
Oh my God, what's happening?

28
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,180
Okay, that was insane

29
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:26,620
You know what happened once I moved from my little area over here

30
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:33,900
It got crazy like I ain't moving from this spot again. I could promise you that anyone behind me

31
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,620
Get away from my spot. Get away from my little area

32
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:43,900
Oh, no, wait, wait, I'm not ready. I'm not ready yet. I'm not ready for this. Get away from me

33
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:48,960
So after the three fails in a row

34
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:55,229
I think I finally figured it out and we're gonna try and go for gold here and by gold

35
00:03:55,229 --> 00:03:57,469
I want to at least make it to like wave five

36
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,430
Okay, I'll be like happy if I make it to like wave five or six or something

37
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:09,780
I just can't keep dying at like wave two. All right, we're at wave four. Where is this guy? Where is this guy?

38
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:19,329
I got I got some bullets. I'll be okay wave four. Oh, there they are. There they are

39
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:28,939
See ya. Uh, I don't really want a hug. You can take that out of here. You bastard

40
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:36,399
Do I have enough money for the smg? I think that's an smg. Pretty sure it is. Let's go get it times two

41
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,480
What what? Oh times two. Oh

42
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:41,779
Get exploded

43
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:47,620
Wow, they're coming in fast coming in hot coming in hot coming in hot coming in hot jump over. No

44
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,050
Not screwing this up again, you're not gonna like take this from me. I'm getting away five

45
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,290
You understand that you understand that lady?

46
00:04:56,449 --> 00:05:02,740
I'm getting away five right now and i'm gonna be the master of call of duty black ops 2

47
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:07,519
I get this would be so much easier with like another person because you could all like

48
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,959
You can like talk to each other and know what's happening and know where you're going

49
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:14,800
And this is a bad place for me to be right now for sure. Yeah, I just killed myself

50
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,379
I think I need to be very very very

51
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:26,910
Oh my god, just eye of the tiger eye of the tiger I got out

52
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:32,300
I used eye of the tiger and I got out. Can you believe it? Yeah, everyone right there is done

53
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:44,699
Eye of the tiger that's like crawling. At least I got to wave five

54
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:48,339
That's all I wanted to get to wave five

55
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:57,069
At least uh, oh man. Well, thank you for watching. Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you enjoyed
