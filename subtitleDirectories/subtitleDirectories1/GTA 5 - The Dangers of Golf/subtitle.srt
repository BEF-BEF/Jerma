00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:22,079
Well, the guy in the striped shirt's a real cocky asshole, huh? I wonder how we're gonna deal with this situation, hmm? Could you guess? We're gonna fucking...

2
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:48,579
You're holding one, and here's holding two, and then here's your holding three.

3
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:58,119
Damn! Oh, alright, alright, that's two. That's double points, right? Alright, I'll take it, I'll take it.

4
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:05,120
Now, I'm gonna smash up somebody's cock, or I'll just miss. Hit the fucking car!

5
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,810
No, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to! I'm dead!

6
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:25,700
Let's get this shot lined up. No more messing around, we're gonna play golf. That was the wrong club. I didn't mean to use the sand wedge on the tee.

7
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:38,700
Step aside, my boy. Let me show you how a real golf pro does it. Yes, watch the ball gracefully fly through the air. 225 yards. That's a new record for me. You should probably take notes.

8
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:58,230
So this is, uh, this is what you're supposed to wear to the golf course, right? Like a dress? You're a joker! Call the cops, yeah, go ahead, try it.

9
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:11,550
She's actually gonna call the cops. Are you kidding me? What? I seriously have a star right now because I'm wearing a dress.

10
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:28,009
I honestly cannot believe that there's police swarming this area right now because there's a man in a fucking dress. Like, really? This is like, this is illegal? It's this illegal? To wear a dress? I'm not putting one on ever again.

11
00:02:28,009 --> 00:02:32,009
That means I put a dress on, but I'm just kidding, don't worry.

12
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:43,300
Alright, let's do this. Let's go golfing again, my friend. Where'd you go? What? Alright, let's get in. Get on in here!

13
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:52,680
What the fuck is happening to this guy? Is it like another dimension? Is he right? Can I run him over?

14
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:02,180
This guy is in like the stomach punch dimension. Can I? I'm not doing that!

15
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,180
I'm not doing that!
