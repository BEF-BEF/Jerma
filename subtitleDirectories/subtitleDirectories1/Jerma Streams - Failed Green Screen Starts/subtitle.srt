1
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:20,689
Alright, now you can hear me and the audio sucks and it's always gonna suck on German985's YouTube channel

2
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:27,090
And his twitch channel because he's too much of a fucking idiot to purchase a boom mic that could just hang down here

3
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:33,030
Off camera instead. He brought his goddamn desktop microphone all the fucking way all the way over here

4
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:36,989
But it's probably better than was last time if it's not then

5
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:40,590
Look at me because I can't fucking do anything about it

6
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,260
You all right, I can't like test this

7
00:01:58,099 --> 00:02:00,969
Okay, you know, I'm like in like Looney Tunes

8
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,450
When like Bugs Bunny plays fucking tennis with himself. That's what I feel like I'm doing right now

9
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:09,129
Like I'm like, hey, can you hear me?

10
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:43,990
Blurry what I guess not blurry I can see it over there blurry what

11
00:02:50,599 --> 00:03:28,199
No, I just made it darker it shouldn't be blurry

12
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:35,629
It's low resolution. What?

13
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:38,120
Am I streaming this in the wrong resolution?

14
00:03:38,120 --> 00:04:07,419
No, it shouldn't be

15
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:17,850
What the fuck? What is this up wrong? It's a goddamn camera

16
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:31,930
What the fuck is it doing?

17
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,800
Computers. Computers suck. Don't even buy one

18
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,060
Wait, why is this? It's like broken

19
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,060
Like can you even see?

20
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:52,430
What the fuck is going on right now?

21
00:04:52,430 --> 00:05:05,529
Come on. Hey

22
00:05:05,529 --> 00:05:11,310
Can you hear me? My OBS just crashed

23
00:05:11,310 --> 00:07:26,269
Hi, my name's German985

24
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:30,240
I just spent two hours

25
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,240
Trying to figure out what the fuck was wrong with my computer

26
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:49,899
He was crying

27
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:57,769
I uh

28
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:03,519
I uh

29
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:08,000
I have no idea what's going on

30
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That's the honest to God truth

31
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,759
It looks like a deep thing

32
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:22,779
It looks like PS3 graphics

33
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:24,779
Let me just

34
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:48,269
Hey, you got something on your face

35
00:08:48,269 --> 00:09:14,879
Any better? I just like wiped it

36
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:16,879
I wiped it off

37
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:23,080
Can you see?

38
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:37,019
Alright, here's the thing that makes no fucking sense

39
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:39,019
I'm going to level with me here

40
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:41,019
This is the same camera

41
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:43,019
This is the same computer

42
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:45,019
This is the same place

43
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:47,019
Less than 24 hours ago

44
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:52,200
What the fuck happened?

45
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,200
It doesn't make any sense

46
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,200
If it looks that weird

47
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:11,950
Give me one second

48
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,950
We're going to troubleshoot this together

49
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,950
Because I got news for you

50
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,889
I paid for this fucking spot

51
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:20,889
And I'm going to use it

52
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:48,519
What if I do this?

53
00:10:48,519 --> 00:11:04,720
Oh fuck my leg

54
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,960
Hit the camera

55
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:15,529
You can see the refresh rate

56
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:17,960
Dude, 60 hertz

57
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,960
60 hertz refresh rate

58
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:29,100
What the fuck is this?

59
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,769
Can you see that?

60
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:35,769
That don't make no fucking sense

61
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:40,960
I'm looking at the preview

62
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,960
Right now

63
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,129
I'm looking at the preview in OBS

64
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:47,129
It's perfect

65
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:49,129
This shit is perfect on OBS

66
00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:51,440
What the heck is happening here?

67
00:11:51,440 --> 00:12:06,480
It's perfect on OBS

68
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,480
Dude, 30 fps

69
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,070
Does anyone remember

70
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,690
Those of you that were here the last time we did this

71
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I streamed it in 60

72
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
To make sure we'd get the fast fucking movements

73
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Right?

74
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I didn't stream it in 30 last time

75
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I shouldn't have to do that

76
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:45,500
I did 30, it was 30

77
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,759
What do you mean it was 30?

78
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:51,840
It was 30?

79
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:57,340
Don't fuck with me here

80
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:08,279
Wait, hold on

81
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:12,169
Hold on a second

82
00:13:12,169 --> 00:13:19,600
Are you serious?

83
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,279
I gotta get to my computer

84
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:38,779
Wait

85
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:47,470
How is he blurry

86
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:51,740
Alright

87
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,429
Here's what I'm gonna do

88
00:13:54,429 --> 00:13:56,429
We'll try this

89
00:13:56,429 --> 00:13:58,600
I feel like I'm getting

90
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,000
Deja vu right now

91
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Did I do this exact same thing

92
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,360
And go, oh this looks like shit

93
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,360
And then we did it in 1080 in 30

94
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,870
This is crazy?

95
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,870
This happened the last time

96
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:21,179
Is that what you're telling me?

97
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:23,179
It's in a twilight zone

98
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:32,330
I'll be right back
