1
00:00:22,969 --> 00:00:38,539
I don't know that was fucked up. I was having problems. My internet's fine. Must be maintenance.

2
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:54,200
This is Dread X. We're just gonna play Dread X because Steam still doesn't fucking work.

3
00:00:55,179 --> 00:01:08,629
An hour and 20 minutes later. So we're gonna just do Dread X. Having fun. Finally, finally.

4
00:01:08,629 --> 00:01:23,700
I still can't get it to download a game. Try the Steam stuff tomorrow. Is it gonna be will it be

5
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:32,980
live tomorrow? Okay, we have till the 20th. Alright. Hey guys, welcome to the stream. Uh,

6
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:37,379
pretend the last one didn't happen. I didn't stream today. I'm very late. It's five o'clock.

7
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:45,769
I'm just starting right now. Very. I'm starting right now. Dread X. This is a bunch of horror

8
00:01:45,769 --> 00:01:52,329
games. It's gonna be scary. So I'm gonna suggest you. I don't care. Let's go. I'm gonna start with

9
00:01:53,290 --> 00:02:05,640
Car Thank. Oh, okay. I was like, what happened? This is the first one. This is Dread X collection

10
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:36,330
one. Here we go. How's the volume? Good. Car Thank. Press enter to continue. What the fuck is

11
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:42,490
happening? I fucking hate computers. Your mission is to investigate the ruins of the ancient

12
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:53,669
Dalvik Kate civilization. But something about things there. Explore the temple and reassemble

13
00:02:53,669 --> 00:03:03,580
the mummy. Is that the map? I ain't gonna be able to do this. This map is fucking crazy.

14
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:18,629
Turn your lights off. It's it's light out right now. Doesn't matter. Actually. Yeah, I do. That's

15
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:37,240
a good idea. I can see better. And I look I look a little bit more orange. Why did that make it

16
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:59,990
worse? Okay. Explore and reassemble the mummy. This looks weird. It looks like I'm being interviewed.

17
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:39,529
And I don't want my identity to be known. This is not gonna work. Okay, so we take it. Okay,

18
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:57,110
got a picture. Can I save it or something? What the hell was that? I already did this joke.

19
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:10,740
You're like a 16 year old streaming in his dark room. Oh my fucking god. There. Now it's a little

20
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:45,339
it's creepy, right? Okay, so what am I to explore and put the mummy together? Nice ring light. Yeah,

21
00:05:45,339 --> 00:06:21,459
I know. It's fucking annoying. Anything there? Turn around nerd. Let me turn around. It's kind

22
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:26,810
of okay playing a dark scary game during the daytime is impossible unless you put curtains

23
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:31,769
up across your entire house. I can't like that's like glare on my fucking screen. I can't even see

24
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:56,439
what's going on. All right, I gotta put the mummy was with the mummy was the thing I took a picture

25
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:08,889
of before. I mean, this looks like a place where a mummy goes, right? What do I do with this?

26
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:49,319
Open it. How space click block the window with a piece of cardboard. Hold on. Fucking maintenance.

27
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:10,540
Fucking goddamn maintenance. I need to recalibrate the camera.

28
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:30,699
Fucking maintenance. He's a vampire. No, that just like hurt my head. Okay, how we look now?

29
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:37,269
Hey, that's better. It's a little creepier. Streaming didn't even start yet. Just relax.

30
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:40,710
All right. I'm putting on my headphones. You know that how it's going to get real now.

31
00:08:40,710 --> 00:09:12,740
Can I open doors? You're walking in circles, bro. What else do we want? What do we want me to go?

32
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:38,870
The directions I have are put the mummy back together with the mummy. Do you like Dr. Pepper?

33
00:09:38,870 --> 00:10:34,519
Yeah. How many games are in this collection? Like 15. All right, this one's cool. Am I missing

34
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:45,620
something? What does this mean? Something is like getting lost in the ticket line at Disney World

35
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:59,049
and complaining that the park sucks. All right, but if you got out of the line eventually,

36
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:03,129
and an attendant was there saying, thanks for coming. And you're like, wait, was the ride?

37
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:21,429
If that was the ride, then do I can I interact? I want to see this to the end. I want to see this

38
00:11:21,429 --> 00:11:24,779
to the end. This guy, I got to be able to do something, right? Like look at all these

39
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:55,669
fucking symbols. Pick up the light. All right. All right. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I

40
00:11:55,669 --> 00:12:21,909
get it. I get it. I just put a light to place up and find something interesting to look at.

41
00:12:30,409 --> 00:12:48,230
He doesn't get it. Neither do you. Neither do you. So that's fine. We can share. We can share it.

42
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:55,080
You don't get it either. You don't get it either. What is it? You don't get it either.

43
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:11,210
Do I have like a task menu or something? It just said put them, assemble them up,

44
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:36,940
explore and assemble the mummy. Where's the mummy? Can I go in these doors? I don't get it.

45
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:56,250
The light has a symbol on the back. Where? That thing was missing. This thing's moving,

46
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:06,620
by the way. This thing is moving. Get a picture of that. What the hell is that?

47
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:25,820
There's somebody's arm or body or something. Okay. So that's there. I got a picture of it.

48
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:45,610
I want to see what that is. Get a picture of that. What is that? I have to go use the portal?

49
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:17,610
Aim it at the mirror? Where is there a mirror? What have you decided is a mirror here?

50
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:58,629
This is the hub world. This is a fucking hub world? What the fuck is that? Stop pretending.

51
00:15:58,629 --> 00:16:02,789
Guys, the only information was explore and put the mummy together. It didn't say go point your

52
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:27,460
camera into a fucking mirror. All right, relax. This is a dinner serving tray. This is not a mirror.

53
00:16:27,460 --> 00:17:30,890
I can go down there. This is not a roblox game. This is a game journalist. No, I am not. That

54
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:43,029
was unclear. I swear to God. How did he die? The monster must have got him in that scary game. No,

55
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:48,069
now he broke both of his legs jumping off a fucking small platform and now he's dead.

56
00:17:48,069 --> 00:19:12,420
Can I make this jump? I can. All right, where's my prize? Can I open that? How do I open this?

57
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:36,059
There's definitely a mummy piece in here, right? Okay. Is there any indicator where that is?

58
00:19:36,619 --> 00:19:56,809
God damn it. Put the fucking camera down. It was at the beginning of the room.

59
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:24,549
Was it really? God damn it. It really was. I got to take a picture of it.

60
00:20:38,170 --> 00:21:09,660
Okay. Yeah, we're getting to major F. I don't understand. It's just like I don't know why

61
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:17,819
this happens randomly every few months. I just can't stream to Twitch. Twitch just doesn't want

62
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:57,140
me to stream to it. My internet is perfectly fine. Hold on. Hold on. Yeah, I don't know why

63
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:04,200
this happens sometimes. Sometimes my streaming to Twitch's servers, it just fucks up for two

64
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:10,170
straight weeks. Because think about it, right? Every stream during the Elden Ring streams,

65
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:15,049
this has happened for a little while. Then it went away for two months. I don't get it.

66
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:20,259
Fucking maintenance. Should I just never stream on a Tuesday?

67
00:22:21,769 --> 00:22:29,740
Why is it always Tuesday? I'm just literally never turning my stream on ever again on a Tuesday.

68
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:45,220
Let me, I'm checking something. Hold on. I'm never turning a stream on on a Tuesday

69
00:22:45,220 --> 00:23:02,329
ever again. It's the goddamn maintenance day for every company on earth.

70
00:23:02,329 --> 00:23:15,829
All right. Let me, I'm going to run a test here. I don't know what I get. I just, we just have to

71
00:23:15,829 --> 00:23:21,529
deal with it, I guess. That's so annoying. I hate when this happens. You know why this sucks the

72
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:29,589
most? Because I'm like, I'm very busy and I'm trying to get like streams in like a few times

73
00:23:29,589 --> 00:23:35,779
a week during like all the busy shit. And I'm just being like, the tap is being turned off.

74
00:23:35,779 --> 00:23:49,589
I can't even stream today. Am I even still alive? I'm going to be angry now. I'm just going to be

75
00:23:49,589 --> 00:24:01,819
upset about everything. All right. So I, I just did a speed test right now during when I was just

76
00:24:01,819 --> 00:24:11,509
dropping frames here. I was at a thousand, a thousand. I don't know. Whatever. I don't get it.

77
00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:17,190
Let's just keep playing. This, I'm sorry. We have to deal with this, but it's unfortunate.

78
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:22,630
Fuck. You know what sucks the most? And you didn't hear anything else. I went off on a,

79
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:26,940
well, good. I went off on a rant. Whatever. All right. Let's just, let's just play.

80
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:43,369
I'm really thrown. I'm really thrown off today. Really thrown off today. No, no, no, no, no, no,

81
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:54,359
I had the picture taken. I just, Oh my. I'm fucking thrown off now. Give me a break.

82
00:24:55,420 --> 00:25:32,119
I have to fucking be pissed in a minute. I'm so thrown off right now. All my juices are all

83
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:51,339
fucked up. So mad. At least the scream is funny. You know, okay. It's like, okay. I'm going to

84
00:25:51,339 --> 00:26:01,559
settle down because I'm fucking pissed right now. I am pissed off. One, two, three. Okay.

85
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:05,319
Let's just, just as chill. Let's take a second. I can take a sip.

86
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:14,789
The music makes it seem like I'm such much more of a unhinged person.

87
00:26:15,589 --> 00:26:18,789
I'm going to mute the audio cause like the audio is making me fucking mad.

88
00:26:26,579 --> 00:27:05,670
I can't shake it. I can't shake it. God, dude. I can't shake it. I can't shake it. All right.

89
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:18,119
Was it, was it? Okay. Person. I don't know. Camera. I don't know. Camera TV. I don't know.

90
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:35,079
I don't know. What is this? Okay. Let's go. Person. No, put the camera down. All right.

91
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:48,309
Somebody, Ahmad helped me. Thank you. Of course for that person. You know, you got man,

92
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:55,259
camera TV. See, they say nobody gets this. They say that's my favorite part about that whole

93
00:27:55,259 --> 00:28:00,710
interview. They say, they say nobody, nobody can get this. Nobody gets this. Nobody could get that.

94
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:10,730
I think nobody, nobody can do this. All right. What is it? I can't even do it.

95
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:31,369
Huh? What's the last symbol? Hey, what's the last symbol? What's the last symbol?

96
00:28:31,369 --> 00:28:37,319
There's only three symbols there in that mod chat. What's the last symbol? Oh, the box opened. Oh,

97
00:28:37,319 --> 00:29:08,099
cool. Oh, I got a piece of the mummy. What's up with the internet? Nothing. The last time this

98
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:24,980
happened, I ran a speed test. Oh my God. It's the mummy. Am I still alive? What happened?

99
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:35,460
Was I not supposed to die? Jesus. That was actually kind of terrifying.

100
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:43,269
I think it's a Twitch problem. The last time I did this, I ran a speed test overnight

101
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:48,549
and I was cleanly at almost a thousand, one thousand up and down for an entire evening.

102
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:54,329
This is fucking Tuesday maintenance. Can we rename this stream Tuesday maintenance?

103
00:29:55,049 --> 00:30:04,200
Fuck maintenance or something. I don't know what to say. That was crazy. I think I lost.

104
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:12,519
Should I go back? There's a lot to see. I need to settle down. I am settled down.

105
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:51,400
What are you doing? I just died. That was unfair. I wasn't fair to that one.

106
00:30:53,190 --> 00:31:01,029
Last time I was dealing with Tuesday maintenance. What's this one? Don't go out? Shatter? Hand of

107
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:21,690
doom. I think I want to try this one. Let's do hand of doom. Am I orange today? Because all the

108
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:45,990
blood is flowing to my face. Hand of doom. Okay. How does this one work? What did figure?

109
00:31:50,410 --> 00:32:09,380
Okay. It's a book of dread incantations. Sure looks to be useful.

110
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:42,019
It didn't work. Okay. Oh, unlock doors. I got it. Okay.

111
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:58,119
Failed? What do you mean? That's right there. Open it. A locked door. I just opened it with a spell.

112
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:26,299
What is it? Talethistort. Nice. Enter the dark dungeon. Hedge wizard.

113
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:33,240
You must be the newest resident of the dungeon. How did you escape from the dungeon?

114
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:45,140
You may have been better off staying locked up. Okay. Can I throw a fireball at him or something?

115
00:33:51,930 --> 00:34:02,250
Is this the same person? Wait. That book. Could it be? It's the Lost Grimoire. The master searches

116
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:09,909
for it. They say it grants the wielder great power. Pray the master does not learn you possess it.

117
00:34:12,579 --> 00:34:12,980
Okay.

118
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:40,550
I know that one. Step aside. Fucking amateur. One spell Andy coming through.

119
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,860
And all it is is unlock a door.

120
00:34:42,860 --> 00:35:17,380
Nice. Let's go. What was that? Oath of Flame.

121
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:24,099
Ethistalort.

122
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:52,070
Okay. There's a torch. Oh shit. Can I pick that up? Ethistalort.

123
00:35:59,829 --> 00:36:10,920
Which way should I go?

124
00:36:45,449 --> 00:36:46,969
Stop doing that. Why is it blowing out?

125
00:36:52,179 --> 00:37:15,510
Oh, that's okay. All right. I got light. Where is there no light this way? All right.

126
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:27,179
Ethistalort. Is it going to speed up my voice? Stop wasting your mana on starlight.

127
00:37:27,739 --> 00:37:29,820
Holy shit. Let me tell you something about starlight, by the way.

128
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:42,889
Hold on. Dude, I tried coke starlight. Coke starlight is unbelievable. It's like the

129
00:37:42,889 --> 00:37:53,269
greatest soda I've ever had in my whole life. A knife with dark sorcery. You feel compelled to

130
00:37:53,269 --> 00:38:10,440
take it. Coke starlight is so good. It's just regular coke. No, it's not. Coke starlight,

131
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:16,920
it tastes kind of like cotton candy with vanilla coke in it. I don't know. It's very interesting.

132
00:38:19,219 --> 00:38:22,260
Of all the dumb gimmick flavors I've ever come up with, I think it's really good.

133
00:38:23,059 --> 00:38:28,300
What the fuck? Ethistalort.

134
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:49,880
This is lasting a lot less than... Oh, I have a knife. So what should I do now? Should I stab

135
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:59,829
somebody? What the fuck just happened? What did I just do that for? Why did I just do that?

136
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:12,739
Just stabbed myself in the hand. Okay, does somebody... Do I have to kill that monster

137
00:39:12,739 --> 00:39:31,579
that's in here? Or should I just leave? Because this is hand. Just leave? Okay.

138
00:39:48,579 --> 00:39:56,969
All right, so I got the knife. Enter the graveyard.

139
00:40:09,579 --> 00:40:10,940
Blood fountain? Okay.

140
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:31,260
Okay, so that's health. I get it. So there's a demo. Wait, we got demos working. Steam works

141
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:37,670
like two fucking hours later. Streaming on a goddamn Tuesday ever again. All right, so

142
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:44,519
yeah, I don't know if I'm gonna do it though. I'd rather try to do that again tomorrow if the

143
00:40:45,320 --> 00:41:17,429
server shit is better for Orts. Yeah, this is just annoying. I got an idea. I got an idea.

144
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:25,510
We are at almost 10% of all frames being dropped, which that's... Fuck, that's awful.

145
00:41:28,329 --> 00:41:36,090
I'm gonna... Here's what I'm gonna do. This is the plan. I am going to try again later today.

146
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:49,019
Try to come back tonight. Because this is very obviously not fixing itself. And I really don't...

147
00:41:49,019 --> 00:41:54,860
Streams where you drop 10% of all frames, they just... It's just... Especially for VODs and...

148
00:41:55,820 --> 00:42:03,659
I'll try later. The whole vibe of the stream gets all fucked up. And it's just like, all right,

149
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:10,980
the internet sucks. Well, not the internet, but whatever the connection is here. I'll try. Let

150
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:19,619
me try later tonight. I'll be back. Download some demos. I'll get some... We'll try some demos

151
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:30,860
tonight. Because I have to imagine that maybe later it'll be okay. Let me try coming back in

152
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:43,449
like an hour or so. Maybe like an hour or two. So sorry, guys. This frustrates me. Trust me,

153
00:42:43,449 --> 00:42:51,739
this frustrates me as much as it frustrates you. And then some. But... And I'd rather just do it

154
00:42:51,739 --> 00:42:59,579
when it works. But we'll try it again. These games, I want to... Let's get back to this.

155
00:43:00,219 --> 00:43:04,139
I was very frustrated during that last game. And not the game's fault is the fucking goddamn

156
00:43:04,139 --> 00:43:10,679
Tuesday. Here, it's already doing it again. Not the game's fault. I was already upset. That game

157
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:21,559
has seemed pretty fun. I want to make sure that I make that clear. It frustrates me more. Yeah,

158
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:26,920
I'll be back. Let me try this again. I'll see you guys a little bit later. Sorry. We'll try again

159
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,679
in a couple hours. Probably like eight o'clock Pacific. If we can't get it to work then, then I

160
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:36,659
don't know what to say. I'll try again tomorrow. So I'm going to turn the stream off and I'm going

161
00:43:36,659 --> 00:43:42,630
to scream into a pillow. I'm going to hold it up and just go... So yeah, it's pretty fun.

162
00:43:46,070 --> 00:44:02,710
Do four orbs before you leave. All right, yeah. That doesn't do anything. Smash. Smash. All right,

163
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:07,780
I'll try again later. I'll be back. We're not even going to do an outro. I'll see you in an hour or

164
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:11,699
two. Goodbye. See you later. Good night. If you're leaving, if we see you again tonight,

165
00:44:11,699 --> 00:44:19,590
then hi. How are you? Good to see you. My name is me. I'll be back. Goodbye. See you later today.

166
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:26,440
All right, now I'm going to pretend to click the off button and go like, fuck,

167
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:35,619
fuck, like I did earlier, right? All right, goodbye. I'll see you in a minute.

168
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:38,179
A lot of minutes in a row. Goodbye.
