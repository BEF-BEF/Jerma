1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:16,350
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2. Oh, that spy got in the damn way.

2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:22,829
That heavy just got in the way too. Playing- what the hell is going on? Oh, it's a heavy down here.

3
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:25,309
I can't even tell you what's going on right now on my head.

4
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:29,410
So this is-

5
00:00:29,809 --> 00:00:34,420
What the hell just happened right there?

6
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:41,140
Okay, so I'm wearing an unusual hat in real life. It's a burning Jerma head. They go for

7
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:48,369
like two refined metal. They're pretty cheap, but it really hurts to put this on. My whole head gets on fire,

8
00:00:48,369 --> 00:00:52,009
and unfortunately, you get like third degree burns on your head, which is not good.

9
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:55,009
But anyways, I thought it would be funny just to have this on.

10
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:01,579
Unusual hat in real life. When I saw this effect in my little webcam manager there, I had to put it on.

11
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:06,500
I didn't even know it existed. But anyways, what am I doing as a sniper right now? I'm being a real-

12
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,859
Oh!

13
00:01:08,859 --> 00:01:18,379
Get that guy too. Come on! Come on, hit the spy! They're the goddamn spy and I can't-

14
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:21,879
I'm gonna- Wow.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,939
Look at this banana peel. Holy geez. That's been sitting there for like five days.

16
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:35,219
I probably ate that before I went to PAX. That's pretty gross.

17
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:42,250
So let's keep going here. Playing on 2 for it, which- I got actually a lot of requests to do this.

18
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:47,810
People want to see me play on 2 for it, and I really don't think I have one video on 2 for it.

19
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:52,510
This is probably the only one. Maybe one more. You know what? Screw this.

20
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:55,829
Okay, don't hit him. There we go!

21
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:02,709
Scope sniper. Doing default sniper pretty much. We're gonna get this cap right now, aren't we? We better.

22
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:06,250
Are you real or what? I don't know. I don't trust anybody.

23
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:12,340
Don't trust anybody. Oh, how come that didn't register?

24
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:19,229
Get it! Get him! Get somebody through this little hole.

25
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:28,689
So scared right now. Scope sniper on 2 for it. Just nonsense. That is a spy. Can't stand in the same way.

26
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:34,780
What are you doing over here, man? Oh, let's just stay-

27
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:42,469
Oh! God! How did this guy even get up here? How did a heavy just like waltz up here?

28
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:51,280
Now, there's one. Let's keep it rolling here, boys. Let's eat a raw, gross, rotten banana peel while we're at it.

29
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,560
I'm gonna throw that away. Holy- Oh, no, that's two! That's two scores right there.

30
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:03,659
All right. All right. I'm gonna go down to the bottom this time. I'm not gonna stay up here. Or am I?

31
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:13,120
Ah! Get out! I'm gunning for you, you mongrels!

32
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:21,080
Right here. I'm gonna stay right here for a minute. For just a minute. My unusual hat is like really itchy.

33
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:26,449
Is nobody gonna come out here? What's gonna happen? Come on.

34
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:32,479
They just capped one. Did that heavy just go all the way through and cap everything? Yes!

35
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,889
You're gonna get it right here, man. You are getting this right here. I'm gonna shoot you right in your face.

36
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:42,509
It's gonna go through your teeth and out the back of your neck. And no, it's gonna be this heavy, actually.

37
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:50,539
I'm gonna get the right opportune moment. No, it's gonna be this guy instead. Hey, it still works, right? I killed somebody.

38
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:55,819
Oh, you. Oh, you. Get out of town.

39
00:03:57,099 --> 00:04:04,289
Don't want you here no more. And you are not- Yeah, you're real. Okay. I'm okay with that.

40
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:12,280
You're a real spy. Do your thing, man. What did that other- Heavy! Oh, you're dead heavy.

41
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:24,120
Boink! They're gonna win. They've capped twice now. We had two caps in the beginning. And where is this son of a-

42
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,829
I think it's time to go back upstairs.

43
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:34,259
Try to defend the intelligence because that's not gonna be good. If we just lose right now, I'm gonna be very mad.

44
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:45,720
Hey. Hey. No, you're real. How- What is- What's with all these like crazy heavies? At least we got a sentry now.

45
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:59,029
That's good. Good. Good. Spy is up here. Bang! Two in a row. Whoa. Where's this guy? Come here, you.

46
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:07,860
I'm gonna get this pyro. Oh, you know what? Let's- Let's cap this right now. Come on. Support. Support.

47
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:16,490
I would have got him. He has no idea. Oh, baby! Oh, baby! Am I gonna cap this right now?

48
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:23,430
Sniper cap for the win? Is this- Is this gonna happen? Whoa, what am I stuck on? Oh, the stupid teleporter.

49
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:33,769
Oh, this is gonna be a sniper cap right here, guys. This is gonna win it right now. Hell freaking yeah. Oh, yeah.

50
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:35,769
Oh, yeah. Wait, is it- Yeah, it's playing the three.

51
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:44,920
Bang, baby. Well, that was a nice round. I say, uh, go grab yourself one of these unusual hats.

52
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,199
They don't go for very much. And, uh, that's gonna wrap it up here, guys. So,

53
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:54,060
thank you guys so much for watching. Really do appreciate it. And, uh, now I gotta go douse my head in water

54
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,740
to get rid of this unusual hat. So, uh, see y'all next time. And, of course, take care, everybody.
