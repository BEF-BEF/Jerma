1
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,560
What's up?

2
00:00:52,560 --> 00:01:00,039
I'm seeing a lot of people in chat that we're maybe in a betting mood, potentially, one of the mods told me.

3
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:07,150
If you don't know, you're just getting here.

4
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:11,739
Today is a very, very, very special day for a lot of people here.

5
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:19,269
Today is the day that I beat Breath of the Wild.

6
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,079
Wow, didn't think you're going to hear that on a Sunday afternoon, did you?

7
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,599
It's been about four months.

8
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,560
I think the last time was, what, May, April?

9
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,659
So I haven't played in four months.

10
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:44,079
I got one, it's been five months, whatever, it's been more like six.

11
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,060
Well, all right, here's the thing.

12
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:50,019
I've got one more divine beast.

13
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:53,299
Kill that bastard.

14
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,120
Wait, no, you don't kill them.

15
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,319
It's been like five months since I played this.

16
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:58,719
We become friends.

17
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:01,040
I'm not going to, we're not killing any, any divine beasts.

18
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,359
I have, I forgot that that was, okay.

19
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,319
I forgot everything.

20
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:06,980
Apparently.

21
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,120
We're going to team up with the divine beast to take out Ganon.

22
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,020
That's better.

23
00:02:15,949 --> 00:02:20,259
But, uh, I asked how long this would take to do.

24
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,930
If I beat the divine beast, I become friends with the divine beast.

25
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,509
Then go right to Ganon.

26
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:34,509
Could I do it in three hours?

27
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,979
And that is what you'll be betting on today.

28
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,439
We'll see if I can do it.

29
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:47,310
Can I beat this game in under three hours, three hours in one second?

30
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,090
Absolutely not.

31
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:51,370
I'm seeing a few absolutely not.

32
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,300
No way.

33
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:53,819
No way.

34
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:54,460
Absolutely not.

35
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:59,039
Well, I'm going to try anyways.

36
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,430
How long are you going to be live for?

37
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,710
I don't know.

38
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,270
That's a good question.

39
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:09,930
All right.

40
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,370
So if I don't get there and three hours, this, this is the last time I'm ever

41
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,210
going to play Breath of the Wild.

42
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,650
So it's either I beat the game or not.

43
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:20,759
I have to, I'm, I'm confident I'll do it.

44
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:25,840
No chance.

45
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:28,189
That's kind of, okay.

46
00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:32,870
What if I get to the front door of Ganon and I aim the magical holy bow and I'm

47
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,389
about to shoot the first shot and it's three hours goes up and I exit the game.

48
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:44,830
That'd be kind of funny.

49
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:48,930
Yeah.

50
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:54,270
But after this, I'm going to play Breath of the Wild for at most three hours.

51
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,400
Then we're going to move on.

52
00:03:58,879 --> 00:03:59,919
I want to play Punch Out.

53
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,719
I want to play Goldeneye too.

54
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,360
But Goldeneye, they, they re-released it.

55
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,719
They made it HD.

56
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:10,840
Well, they didn't make it HD graphics, but they made it upscaled it, right?

57
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:14,270
I want to play a bunch of Switch stuff.

58
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,069
It's plugged in.

59
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:16,990
It's being captured.

60
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:17,509
So I'm going to do it.

61
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:22,019
So what do you think?

62
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:23,420
Should we, should we go for a countdown?

63
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,029
Wait, I need to get ready first.

64
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,850
It's got a huge raid right at the very beginning.

65
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,329
Holy shit.

66
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:37,930
Thanks for the raid.

67
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:44,779
There's over 2000 people.

68
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:46,220
What's up?

69
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:50,220
Is it K4?

70
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:51,819
Thanks for the raid K4.

71
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,180
Welcome everybody.

72
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:00,220
It's a lot of people.

73
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:02,769
We're going to be playing Breath of the Wild.

74
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:05,800
Face cam off.

75
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:07,750
No, no face cam.

76
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:11,139
Put a timer up.

77
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:11,379
Yeah.

78
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:12,579
Well, don't worry.

79
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,620
We'll, we'll make sure we're very honest about this.

80
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:21,470
Face cam or riot.

81
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:25,889
Well, ain't going to be one.

82
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:26,970
So that's too bad.

83
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,379
Why does it have to be three hours?

84
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:34,939
Exactly.

85
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:37,180
Cause I think that's in pre-stream chat.

86
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:41,060
That's where we kind of all were like, well, some people said it's you.

87
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:45,740
So it'll be five hours, but I disagree.

88
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,649
I think I can do it in three and I'm not rushing to do this, but I, I kind of am

89
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,970
because I, I keep putting off Breath of the Wild.

90
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:55,970
I keep saying, I'm going to play it.

91
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:56,970
I keep saying, Hey, I'll do it.

92
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:57,290
I'll do it.

93
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:57,569
I'll do it.

94
00:05:57,569 --> 00:05:58,089
I just don't do it.

95
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,699
I have to get myself a timer.

96
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:05,509
Plus that's kind of fun.

97
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,800
I'm going to fall off the horse a hundred times in three hours.

98
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,839
And I'm not gonna make any progress.

99
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:12,240
So don't worry.

100
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:16,430
Those of you that are betting, if I can see, all right.

101
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:20,220
Is it just see the end credits in three hours?

102
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,120
He hates this game.

103
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:29,709
No, I did.

104
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:30,110
I don't.

105
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,350
I love Breath of the Wild.

106
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:32,189
Zelda.

107
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:33,230
Let's go.

108
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:33,509
Yeah.

109
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:34,389
It's so much fun.

110
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,149
I'm going to give myself a three hour timer to finish this game and I'm

111
00:06:37,149 --> 00:06:38,189
never playing it ever again.

112
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,579
Oh, Nintendo.

113
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:42,180
Let's go.

114
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,379
Well, I give myself a timer.

115
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:47,100
I think it's just fun.

116
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:50,180
You guys ready?

117
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:52,860
It's the last hit on the final boss.

118
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:53,379
Okay.

119
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,500
So by the way, today is the backseat dream.

120
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,439
You just, I don't want to name emote only ever.

121
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,639
I'm going to be looking for solutions.

122
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:04,839
I'm going to be asking for help.

123
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:08,439
I'm going to say, Hey, what's the best product I could use right now.

124
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,000
And I expect help.

125
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,040
I expect to get through this.

126
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,870
We're looking for the best products.

127
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,389
We're looking for the best, um, equipment.

128
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:19,339
That's cheating.

129
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:19,779
That's fine.

130
00:07:22,329 --> 00:07:22,529
All right.

131
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:22,970
Are we ready?

132
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,129
Are we ready to play this?

133
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:29,459
So I get five minutes of streamer.

134
00:07:30,339 --> 00:07:31,860
Learn how to play the whole game again.

135
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,019
Cause you haven't played it in six months.

136
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:35,540
I get five minutes to run around in a circle and jump.

137
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:36,779
You understand?

138
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:37,699
Okay.

139
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:41,750
I get that.

140
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,279
So that timer, I'm just going to run around in a circle for a few minutes.

141
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:47,959
No emote.

142
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,160
Only all backseating.

143
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:50,160
Yeah.

144
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,680
You can backseat as much as you want.

145
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:54,930
Hey, let me remember how to play.

146
00:07:56,949 --> 00:07:57,389
That's jump.

147
00:07:58,069 --> 00:07:58,470
We're going.

148
00:07:59,149 --> 00:07:59,430
All right.

149
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:00,189
That's jump.

150
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,120
Isn't there a triple jump?

151
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,970
Can't you go like, I'm just trying to make as much people leave as possible

152
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:10,009
in the first 10 minutes.

153
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:15,029
I'm just trying to get as many people to leave as possible in the first five

154
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:15,149
minutes.

155
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:17,060
You said the same thing twice.

156
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,800
No, that way that's in tears of the kingdom.

157
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:28,620
All right.

158
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,980
The timer does not start until I say it does.

159
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:31,379
Okay.

160
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:36,129
And we're going to keep, I have a, I'm keeping track over here.

161
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,179
All right.

162
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:40,419
That's, this is sprint slash.

163
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:40,659
Okay.

164
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:42,899
I got, I got the master sword last time.

165
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:45,740
This thing is unbreakable, right?

166
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:51,269
Let's put a timer on screen.

167
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,470
I don't want to put a timer on screen because I feel like it'll ruin the VOD.

168
00:08:58,049 --> 00:08:58,529
They're okay.

169
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,289
Every VOD before this did not have a three hour timer.

170
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,490
And the people that watch the VODs and they're just trying to hang out and just

171
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:04,769
chill.

172
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:05,769
Like, Oh, cool.

173
00:09:05,809 --> 00:09:07,009
What's this timer on the screen?

174
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:09,169
I want to watch the streamer play breath of the wild.

175
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:09,850
What is this?

176
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,200
No, he ruined it.

177
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,360
He ruined the playthrough.

178
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,519
You ruined the playthrough.

179
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,639
I don't want to hear that.

180
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,070
All right.

181
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:21,870
That's how you, right.

182
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,269
You got, I got the freezing.

183
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:24,070
I got the camera.

184
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,470
I've got the magnet.

185
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,029
That's a jump swing.

186
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:29,389
The master sword can't be broken.

187
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:30,669
Thank God we finally got it.

188
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:30,950
All right.

189
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,110
So this is the thunder blade.

190
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:40,299
So if this is going to be truly the last breath of the wild stream, you better

191
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:41,659
believe I'm going to be throwing these people.

192
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:43,259
Like I'm going to be, this is awesome.

193
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:44,460
I'm so happy about this.

194
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:49,149
Me saying this is the last time I'm going to play play breath of the wild.

195
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:53,029
I now the whole, everything is now open.

196
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:55,350
Now I'm just going to use this weapon because I feel like it.

197
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,980
That's so awesome.

198
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,980
I'm so happy about that.

199
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:00,980
I don't even care.

200
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:01,779
I don't even know what this is.

201
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:02,500
I'm going to use it now.

202
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:04,860
I finally am.

203
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,539
I'm going to, I'm allowed to use all these weapons because I know it's the

204
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:08,379
last time I'm going to play it.

205
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:12,559
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

206
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:13,240
The timer started.

207
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:15,909
Wait, the timer.

208
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:17,830
Oh, I, I, uh, timer started.

209
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:18,110
Hold on.

210
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:19,419
All right.

211
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:19,860
I know how to jump.

212
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:20,259
All right.

213
00:10:20,259 --> 00:10:20,460
All right.

214
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:20,700
All right.

215
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,139
Right, right, right.

216
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:23,419
Here's what I, here's what I need to do.

217
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,090
Oh, wait, let me, let me turn this in first.

218
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:28,970
It's a question.

219
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:30,690
No, no.

220
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,409
Three, two, one.

221
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:31,649
Go.

222
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:32,009
Hold on.

223
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:32,649
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

224
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:35,100
435.

225
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,320
Let me turn this down.

226
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,440
No, I have to turn this question.

227
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,580
A lot of people don't think I'm going to do this.

228
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,980
I cannot wait until you all get this completely wrong.

229
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,809
Skip the dialogue.

230
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,809
No, it hasn't officially started yet.

231
00:10:55,429 --> 00:10:56,629
You want a different outcome this time?

232
00:10:56,629 --> 00:10:56,950
Okay.

233
00:10:57,389 --> 00:10:57,750
All right.

234
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,460
I think we have a cut scene here.

235
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,039
I am not going to fail.

236
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:08,200
Okay.

237
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:08,799
How strange.

238
00:11:09,789 --> 00:11:10,470
Please beat it.

239
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,110
Please.

240
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:16,590
I give you five extra minutes.

241
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:17,110
Oh, okay.

242
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,309
Okay.

243
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:18,029
No, we're good.

244
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:18,269
We're good.

245
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,019
You wore that champion's tunic every day.

246
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:24,940
I feel as though I've been transported in time.

247
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:27,379
Link, our princess, you must rescue her.

248
00:11:27,379 --> 00:11:27,580
All right.

249
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:31,080
So where's the, what, what is this a quest for?

250
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,679
I'm really glad you gave me that extra time.

251
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:37,769
You may not remember your last meeting with Ganon, but it did not end well for you.

252
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:40,460
Why, why is this a quest?

253
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,120
Upstairs?

254
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,639
Backseat as much as possible, by the way.

255
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:51,330
The shit that would get you banned in other chats of just like telling me where to go.

256
00:11:52,049 --> 00:11:52,769
Oh, I want it all.

257
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:53,450
I want to see.

258
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:57,009
I want to, uh, anything that you would, we're talking backseat is open.

259
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:58,090
The floodgates are completely open.

260
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,500
I want exact coordinates to every single encounter.

261
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:08,490
What is this quest?

262
00:12:13,419 --> 00:12:14,620
Captured memories.

263
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,480
What is this?

264
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,379
Captured memories.

265
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,419
Princess Zelda left behind an album with 12 pictures in it.

266
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:27,220
Traveling to the places shown in these pictures may help you regain your memories.

267
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:27,700
What?

268
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:30,370
Why is this?

269
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,769
Oh, but that was, that was like set as a destination.

270
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:34,129
I just wasted five minutes.

271
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:37,710
Why was that set as a destination?

272
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:38,830
Okay.

273
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:39,429
Well, what time is it?

274
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:40,149
All right.

275
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,029
We didn't even start it yet.

276
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,190
Wait, wait, wait, wait, go back.

277
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:46,389
Go back.

278
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:46,669
Go back.

279
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,190
Ignore everything, but go to the top left of the map.

280
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:49,830
Ignore this.

281
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:53,019
Where's all right.

282
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:53,500
Where's the beast?

283
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:56,740
Where's the, I don't, the next beast is not on the map.

284
00:12:56,779 --> 00:12:57,500
Where is the beast?

285
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:01,529
Top left.

286
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:01,929
Top left.

287
00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:02,370
Top left.

288
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:02,690
All right.

289
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,139
Like up here.

290
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,700
Fastest way to get there.

291
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:08,940
Fastest way to get there.

292
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:10,950
Ignore the beast.

293
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:11,590
Go right to get it.

294
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,629
No, I want to, I want to, I got three hours.

295
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:15,590
I'm the timer hadn't even started yet.

296
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:19,860
Go West.

297
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,299
Go West.

298
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:20,740
Go West.

299
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:21,899
Central tower.

300
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:23,419
Right here.

301
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:24,379
Let's go.

302
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:26,490
All right.

303
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:29,169
Let the, uh, timer starts now.

304
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:30,129
Exactly.

305
00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:30,370
Wait.

306
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:30,649
Yeah.

307
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:35,059
And exactly three hours from right now, I plan on seeing the ending credits of

308
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:40,600
breath of the wild and exactly three hours.

309
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,120
Exactly.

310
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,700
Try to use the horse.

311
00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:53,779
I actually should get a horse because Frank too is somewhere.

312
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,460
I didn't cook any food.

313
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:55,659
All right.

314
00:13:55,659 --> 00:13:56,419
That's where I need to end up.

315
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:56,659
Right.

316
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,049
So we need to go this way.

317
00:14:00,669 --> 00:14:01,389
Stable right here.

318
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,360
Stable right there.

319
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:04,919
I want the horse.

320
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:13,750
He's got another raid.

321
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,500
It's like two huge raids back to back.

322
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,860
Activate the divine beast quest, dude.

323
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:27,230
I don't have the divine beast quest on.

324
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:31,230
All right.

325
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:36,110
That was P S P S P one G P S P big.

326
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,389
I don't read.

327
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:39,389
I can't read names ever.

328
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:40,389
I think that's that what it is.

329
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:46,259
It looks different over here.

330
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,539
It looks different over here.

331
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,620
It looks different over here.

332
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,500
I fucked up big time.

333
00:14:50,539 --> 00:14:50,860
Didn't I?

334
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:52,710
I fucked up big time.

335
00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:55,110
I, it, it says it looks like, okay.

336
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,230
PS one PSP one G.

337
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,379
I'm so sorry.

338
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:01,460
That's not how your name is said.

339
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:02,379
That's what it does.

340
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:03,500
It looks like over here on my other screen.

341
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,419
I'm really sorry, but you're fucking awesome for rating me.

342
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:07,299
Appreciate it.

343
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:14,220
Stop wasting time.

344
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:15,500
I'm not wasting time.

345
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:16,460
I'm apologizing.

346
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,340
What a PR disaster.

347
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:26,809
What I did.

348
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,789
Oh, I'm never going to do this in three hours.

349
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,110
I hope you bet accordingly.

350
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:38,990
God damn it.

351
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,289
Those are two huge rates though.

352
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:47,610
Thanks.

353
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:48,210
Welcome everybody.

354
00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:51,220
All right, let's go.

355
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,860
We want Frank.

356
00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:54,500
Where's Frank two.

357
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:00,639
On at this point, I don't know, but I need a horse and we're taking Frank.

358
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,470
Frank two died.

359
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:12,769
Unfortunate.

360
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:21,980
God damn it.

361
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:30,350
Frank two soft retired.

362
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:32,779
All right.

363
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:34,100
Let me turn the quest on.

364
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:38,820
Okay.

365
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:45,460
Divine beast captured.

366
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:45,860
Remember, right?

367
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,860
Free the divine beasts.

368
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,799
It's all the way up here.

369
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:51,639
Why am I going this way?

370
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:52,639
Why would I not go over here?

371
00:16:54,309 --> 00:16:55,110
Oh, I wanted the horse.

372
00:16:55,549 --> 00:16:56,429
Wait, I can go this way.

373
00:16:57,029 --> 00:16:57,590
Should I go up the road?

374
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:01,139
Just follow the road.

375
00:17:01,299 --> 00:17:01,740
Trust.

376
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:02,100
Trust.

377
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:02,740
Just follow the road.

378
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:06,230
Go, go, go this way.

379
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,859
I need to cook food too.

380
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:10,940
Trust, trust, trust.

381
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:12,059
It's an ancient arrows.

382
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:16,559
Um, I'm just going, that's not the button to ride the horse.

383
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:27,700
I think that's the first time I've seen two just big raids back to back though.

384
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:29,779
Honestly, like all jokes aside.

385
00:17:29,779 --> 00:17:30,180
Thanks guys.

386
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,299
Where would I start at the stream?

387
00:17:39,339 --> 00:17:40,740
This is the easiest divine beast.

388
00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:41,740
You definitely can do it.

389
00:17:42,859 --> 00:17:43,180
All right.

390
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,380
Well, I also want to, I don't want to miss any shrines either.

391
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,740
That's my favorite part of the whole game.

392
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,140
There is no way you do this in three hours.

393
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:54,819
Oh, I hope you bet for it.

394
00:18:05,529 --> 00:18:07,569
Shrines, no shot three hours.

395
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:08,329
I can do it.

396
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:11,630
Guys, it hasn't even been two minutes.

397
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:17,200
I've got a lot of those minutes lined up in a row.

398
00:18:20,589 --> 00:18:21,589
And I have the horse this time.

399
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,950
The first time in the playthrough, I've actually used the horse more than five

400
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:24,109
minutes.

401
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:31,519
People right now are pissed that I actually went to the stable.

402
00:18:34,289 --> 00:18:36,289
He's been running the entire game.

403
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:39,049
It's this time that he now uses the horse.

404
00:18:39,329 --> 00:18:39,609
All right.

405
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:40,210
So where is it?

406
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,140
It's so far away.

407
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:54,759
Hell is that?

408
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,359
Look at the sky.

409
00:19:10,369 --> 00:19:11,609
I crashed into a tree.

410
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:16,259
All right.

411
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:16,740
There's nothing here.

412
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:22,900
I'm looking for a tower.

413
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:34,049
Honestly, is there no tower like right here?

414
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:34,410
Hold on.

415
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:35,859
It has to be.

416
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,619
This is a huge mountain.

417
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:51,339
Follow the road.

418
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,089
That fox did a back flip.

419
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,069
Oh my God.

420
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:01,029
I didn't mean to.

421
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,579
Hold on a second.

422
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:10,579
You don't think I'm going to stop to get this stuff?

423
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,509
This stuff is still worth it.

424
00:20:15,259 --> 00:20:16,660
I need to make food as well.

425
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:19,960
I'm going to stop at then whatever the next town is.

426
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:24,549
You laughed at him.

427
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:29,119
That was a crazy scenario.

428
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:29,799
I didn't mean to.

429
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:30,400
All right.

430
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,079
Uh, give me a tower.

431
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:52,970
Maybe I should just get a pie and just look through that.

432
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,539
I've not, I've seen this thing before.

433
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,640
Should I get a picture of this thing?

434
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,440
I'm going to take a picture of that.

435
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,490
Oh, I think I already did take a picture of this.

436
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,279
I can get a much better picture though.

437
00:21:21,099 --> 00:21:21,660
Nice.

438
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,420
Wait, this one's better.

439
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:37,309
No, get it.

440
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,859
No, it has to be like touching his face.

441
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:47,150
Whatever.

442
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:48,430
Game sucks.

443
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,579
These are the easiest bits I ever made.

444
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:03,819
Wait, what do you mean?

445
00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:08,140
Wait, did the, you can't bet bits and get bits back.

446
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,819
You mean channel point?

447
00:22:12,529 --> 00:22:13,130
I can't move.

448
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:13,450
Hold on.

449
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:17,349
What's wrong with the horse?

450
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,420
Why is the horse not moving?

451
00:22:24,099 --> 00:22:24,339
Okay.

452
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:26,980
I don't know what's going on, but I can't go that way.

453
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:34,259
All right.

454
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:35,420
You come to me then.

455
00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:44,059
There we go.

456
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,549
How much time is left?

457
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:52,940
Hey, 10 minutes.

458
00:22:57,789 --> 00:22:58,069
Okay.

459
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:01,710
I need help.

460
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,069
I need back seaters right now.

461
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:03,670
Help.

462
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,230
Where do I go?

463
00:23:06,269 --> 00:23:07,309
I don't see a tower anywhere.

464
00:23:37,369 --> 00:23:38,490
I don't do the point thing again.

465
00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:52,660
I can't whatever.

466
00:23:54,660 --> 00:24:00,160
I'm going that way.

467
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,160
Should have bet if you're going to beat this divine beast in three hours.

468
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,839
I've, I just saw the divine beast.

469
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,519
It's right there.

470
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:19,000
I found it.

471
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:20,720
And this is, I'm good.

472
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:21,640
Settle down.

473
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:26,579
You know what?

474
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:27,299
Why did I bring the horse?

475
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,859
I'm like, I, I like to glide.

476
00:24:31,089 --> 00:24:32,210
What, what was the point of the horse?

477
00:24:32,569 --> 00:24:33,369
I should have just glid.

478
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,150
Is that a word?

479
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,339
I glid.

480
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,140
That's correct.

481
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:06,339
Right?

482
00:25:19,849 --> 00:25:20,369
Glowed.

483
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,420
Glided?

484
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,029
I glided over there.

485
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:26,710
I glid over there.

486
00:25:32,619 --> 00:25:33,619
I glided over there.

487
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,380
I glid over there.

488
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:36,460
I glided over there.

489
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,539
How'd you get over there?

490
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:42,259
Well, I had to glide.

491
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:43,930
I glid.

492
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:51,549
Wait, am I going?

493
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:51,990
Okay.

494
00:25:52,029 --> 00:25:52,710
I'm going the right way now.

495
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,710
I want to get a big picture of everything over here.

496
00:26:01,869 --> 00:26:03,829
Cause there's not a tower like here anywhere.

497
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:09,759
Can I stand up here?

498
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:11,799
Yes, I can.

499
00:26:13,869 --> 00:26:14,750
I'm going for the glide.

500
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:19,480
Forget about the horse.

501
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:26,859
I can cover three miles with the glider in a 10th of the time it takes to ride

502
00:26:26,859 --> 00:26:31,890
with the horse and I get special mushroom.

503
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:44,299
Okay.

504
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:45,660
To get there.

505
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,299
I'm good.

506
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:49,599
I want a big picture of everything going on here.

507
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,779
Trine right there.

508
00:26:56,819 --> 00:26:57,940
I'm going to ignore it for now.

509
00:27:01,109 --> 00:27:02,349
What else is up here?

510
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:09,700
Okay.

511
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,579
Tower that way.

512
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,259
Tower over there.

513
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:19,289
I think that's the closest tower for sure.

514
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:23,269
You should get the shrine so you can travel.

515
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:26,789
Now that person is smart and I know I get it.

516
00:27:26,789 --> 00:27:29,309
That's a good idea, but I know why you just told me to do that because you're

517
00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:35,460
trying to burn like 40 minutes in that shrine and uh, I'm going to have to say

518
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:44,380
no, can I get the horse over here?

519
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,259
At least, uh, no.

520
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:47,799
All right.

521
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:52,640
So if I head that way, this is, that's definitely going the right direction.

522
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,039
It is.

523
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:53,880
All right.

524
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:54,759
Let's start the glider.

525
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,589
I'm covering miles right now.

526
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,640
To go over that, uh, the bridge.

527
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:19,490
No, I'm not, I, I'll get the shrine because it is fast travel, but let me

528
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:20,250
just take a look what's in there.

529
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:23,470
I'm not going to do it.

530
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:23,869
I just want to look.

531
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:40,019
Okay.

532
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:46,309
Let's get to the fast travel.

533
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:48,339
All right.

534
00:28:48,339 --> 00:28:49,619
There's one right there too.

535
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,599
Which one is closer?

536
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:52,079
Probably that one.

537
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:53,400
That's also in the right direction.

538
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:53,920
So we're going that way.

539
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:59,049
You get sidetracked so easily.

540
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:02,319
I think that's, isn't that the whole point of Breath of the Wild though?

541
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,960
Isn't Breath of the Wild the game to get sidetracked in, out of all games?

542
00:29:09,859 --> 00:29:10,019
All right.

543
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:10,579
It's activated.

544
00:29:10,579 --> 00:29:11,779
I don't want to even see what's in there.

545
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:13,420
Is there one?

546
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,339
There's one over there too.

547
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,059
Let me mark that.

548
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:22,460
I don't know how to do that.

549
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,359
Uh, all right.

550
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:26,400
I'm going to mark it as a treasure chest.

551
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,559
Is that, is that even correct?

552
00:29:29,609 --> 00:29:31,009
Bro, that's not even the right way.

553
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:33,650
I'm going to fuck myself over so bad if that's still here.

554
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,369
It's here.

555
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:39,740
I don't even know if I placed it.

556
00:29:40,099 --> 00:29:40,339
All right.

557
00:29:40,339 --> 00:29:43,859
I placed the other markers five months ago.

558
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:44,740
I don't even know what they're for.

559
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,059
They're probably really important though.

560
00:29:50,859 --> 00:30:00,380
I placed that, I placed that red marker back in, I want to say April or March of

561
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,180
this year or something.

562
00:30:02,579 --> 00:30:03,900
Take all my clothes off quick!

563
00:30:04,779 --> 00:30:05,819
I'm going to get struck by lightning.

564
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,700
What do I do?

565
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:13,920
What do I do?

566
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,799
How do I take this off?

567
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:16,960
Unequip?

568
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:20,269
How do I just unequip something?

569
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:28,440
Okay.

570
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:29,940
See?

571
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,819
That was right there.

572
00:30:33,009 --> 00:30:33,210
Okay.

573
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:34,049
I think I'm good.

574
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:37,289
I'm going to head that way and we're going to get to the tower.

575
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,240
Uh, wait, hold on.

576
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:42,680
There's something here.

577
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,269
Stables.

578
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,029
Oh, hell yeah.

579
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,140
The fuck?

580
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,099
Oh my God.

581
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:52,380
Can this hit them?

582
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:56,819
Wait, I can cook.

583
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:02,259
I'm not going to take very much time doing this.

584
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:06,630
I know this is people are like, Oh my God, dude, this is such shit food.

585
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:07,549
It doesn't matter.

586
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:08,269
I just need to eat it.

587
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,900
Salt and jalapenos, whatever this is.

588
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:24,000
Okay.

589
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:25,079
Do I have any meat or anything?

590
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,220
Mushroom.

591
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:29,619
What, okay.

592
00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:31,740
What is the thing I have to be worried about up here?

593
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:33,289
Is it electricity?

594
00:31:33,289 --> 00:31:34,130
Is it wind?

595
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,529
Is it fire?

596
00:31:35,569 --> 00:31:36,170
What's the thing?

597
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:37,690
It's cold, cold areas.

598
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:38,170
It's cold.

599
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:38,450
Okay.

600
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:40,529
I need to get cold resistant stuff.

601
00:31:43,609 --> 00:31:43,849
Okay.

602
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,009
So this is good for cold.

603
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,539
So let's go with this.

604
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,349
What about this one?

605
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:51,890
Stamina.

606
00:31:52,089 --> 00:31:58,700
Uh, stealth.

607
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,059
Maybe just, uh, like a watermelon.

608
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,160
Heat resistance.

609
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:05,039
I don't think I have very much ingredients.

610
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:05,359
Do I?

611
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:12,480
I need more meat.

612
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,339
Banana.

613
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:18,700
Different effects.

614
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,539
Don't stack.

615
00:32:20,029 --> 00:32:20,549
That's right.

616
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,190
Um, what does this do?

617
00:32:22,349 --> 00:32:28,000
Uh, stop holding.

618
00:32:30,069 --> 00:32:32,670
Should I just get, uh, you have an unsorted inventory.

619
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:33,470
Okay.

620
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,269
So it's sorted now.

621
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:39,500
So should I just do five of these?

622
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,779
Just one, two, three, four, five.

623
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,420
And just have like a bunch of low level.

624
00:32:42,579 --> 00:32:45,690
Um, what do you guys think?

625
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:49,140
Just, that's what I got.

626
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,539
Just one, two, three, four, five with some salt.

627
00:32:53,349 --> 00:32:55,670
Should I add salt or just one, two, three, four, five backseat.

628
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:00,819
Now, please put one wing in there.

629
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:02,339
No salt, just five.

630
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:05,759
See what it is.

631
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:11,789
Well, 10 minutes, 12 minutes.

632
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:13,640
Okay.

633
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,720
That's 12 minutes of low level cold resistance.

634
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,119
Is that going to be good enough?

635
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,279
What happens up here?

636
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:28,069
That's really all you need.

637
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:28,470
Okay.

638
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,529
Cause this will give us like 30 minutes.

639
00:33:38,339 --> 00:33:39,140
I suppose too.

640
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,420
How much money do I have?

641
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:44,839
I'm going to, okay.

642
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:45,880
I think that's all right for now.

643
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,470
So let me get the horse.

644
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:52,019
How far away am I from though?

645
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,039
Thing there.

646
00:33:58,259 --> 00:33:59,180
It's not that far.

647
00:33:59,180 --> 00:33:59,380
All right.

648
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,980
I'm going to unlock that.

649
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:05,630
And then I'm going to get the horse.

650
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:06,869
I need to reveal the map.

651
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,429
Look, it's over there.

652
00:34:09,769 --> 00:34:10,289
I'm getting close.

653
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:20,150
I need this.

654
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,639
Get the horse now.

655
00:34:24,289 --> 00:34:25,130
I feel like I'm all right.

656
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:25,730
Here's what's going to happen.

657
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,369
I'm going to get the horse.

658
00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:28,610
We're going to go across this bridge and I'm going to abandon the horse to

659
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:29,889
climb the side of the mountain up there.

660
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,699
It happens every time.

661
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:40,929
I'll try it though.

662
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:42,210
How much time do I have left?

663
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:43,650
Two and a half hours.

664
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:44,570
I got it.

665
00:34:44,769 --> 00:34:45,090
Easy.

666
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:49,920
All right.

667
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:55,429
Let's get Frank to stay on the road.

668
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,500
I will stay on.

669
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,340
I'm not going to get off the horse.

670
00:34:59,019 --> 00:35:02,690
Oh, okay.

671
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,059
All right.

672
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:06,300
Let's go.

673
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,460
Frank staying on the road.

674
00:35:11,019 --> 00:35:11,739
No bullshit.

675
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,380
This is first time playing video.

676
00:35:15,269 --> 00:35:16,789
No, I'll give you a little bit of insight though.

677
00:35:17,389 --> 00:35:19,110
Um, so this is video game.

678
00:35:19,269 --> 00:35:20,510
Let's just say video game one.

679
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:25,150
Um, since playing video game one, hold on a minute.

680
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:33,889
That was scary because I can possibly get struck by lightning on this bridge.

681
00:35:36,219 --> 00:35:55,769
Yeah, I'm not going to go that way to stay on the bridge trying to stay on the

682
00:35:55,769 --> 00:35:56,050
road.

683
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:58,010
They said stay on the road.

684
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:01,780
They said, look at all this shit on the road.

685
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,719
Where's he going to take that?

686
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:07,280
All right.

687
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:14,070
I'm getting close behind you.

688
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:23,570
I told you I was just going to climb the mountain after leaving the stable and

689
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:25,010
that's exactly what just happened.

690
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:54,869
You missed it.

691
00:36:56,739 --> 00:36:57,980
What was there to miss?

692
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,099
You missed it.

693
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,420
He's leaving the road.

694
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:04,579
Yeah.

695
00:37:04,579 --> 00:37:04,940
Look at this.

696
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,179
These things here, they're going to kill me.

697
00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:09,099
You missed the dragon.

698
00:37:11,539 --> 00:37:12,739
I don't know about any dragons.

699
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:16,179
I'm trying to get to the, I'm trying to get to the, the, the divine beast.

700
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:26,329
All right.

701
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:27,769
Well, so what I was saying is, so, okay.

702
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,280
Uh, so I, I played this game back in April of 2023.

703
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:39,050
I think it's been, it's been about five full months since I've not seen any of the

704
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:39,849
Zelda on the screen.

705
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:47,090
In the meantime, I played like 40 other video games, so it's like each video game

706
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:49,010
kind of is like, wait a minute.

707
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:51,730
Is that what it, oh no, that's from armored core.

708
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:52,929
That's the game I played a week ago.

709
00:37:53,409 --> 00:37:54,329
Not four months ago.

710
00:37:55,659 --> 00:37:56,579
Oh, wait a minute.

711
00:37:56,699 --> 00:37:56,980
Okay.

712
00:37:57,019 --> 00:37:57,980
This is what I can do.

713
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,420
I can do that.

714
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:58,980
No, no, no.

715
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:59,460
Wait, shit.

716
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,500
That's from hit man three.

717
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:01,619
Oh, I did it.

718
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:03,429
Wait, what?

719
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:11,449
Um, I, I need to shoot these.

720
00:38:11,929 --> 00:38:12,530
Do I have any arrows?

721
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,559
What arrows do I have?

722
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:16,960
Hold on.

723
00:38:18,219 --> 00:38:19,139
Do I have regular arrows?

724
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:25,099
Okay.

725
00:38:25,099 --> 00:38:25,820
Well, I can do that.

726
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:26,659
Just come here.

727
00:38:28,789 --> 00:38:30,469
I really don't want to use ice arrows.

728
00:38:46,539 --> 00:38:52,159
Oh, I'm so impatient.

729
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:52,639
I hate it.

730
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:04,369
All right.

731
00:39:04,449 --> 00:39:08,409
We got to see, I have, I can probably upgrade this, right?

732
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:17,940
Five.

733
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:19,309
All right.

734
00:39:19,309 --> 00:39:20,670
Well, that's the destination.

735
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,230
I'm going that way.

736
00:39:22,469 --> 00:39:23,150
Forget about these guys.

737
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,219
You won't beat this divine beast in three hours.

738
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,340
I bet you I do.

739
00:39:40,869 --> 00:39:41,710
I want to unlock this.

740
00:39:47,369 --> 00:39:47,769
You need to buy.

741
00:39:47,769 --> 00:39:49,210
Yeah, I definitely gonna get arrows for sure.

742
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:59,820
Uh, oh yeah.

743
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:00,460
That's really funny.

744
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:05,860
You know, the, the, the Jeremy from eight months ago when I last played this would

745
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,059
have got hit by that a hundred percent.

746
00:40:22,579 --> 00:40:24,260
Let me put on a different weapon.

747
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,159
Hold on.

748
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:31,000
Let me relearn the entire video game.

749
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:31,559
Got it.

750
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,320
Your name is Jeremy?

751
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:49,889
Uh, yeah.

752
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:54,219
Don't these things have eyes that you get to kill?

753
00:41:03,739 --> 00:41:04,460
I wonder if it matters.

754
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:05,619
Maybe I can just climb it.

755
00:41:13,329 --> 00:41:13,610
All right.

756
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:16,969
Whoever's editing this video, I want you to make it look like I hit that thing right

757
00:41:16,969 --> 00:41:19,769
in the head and then have it like cut it out and to do an animation.

758
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:21,090
So it looks like I killed it in one hit.

759
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:26,420
That's why I did that.

760
00:41:33,579 --> 00:41:37,039
Can I just get like, get on top of this right now?

761
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:37,480
Hold on.

762
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:40,909
Uh, I can't touch that stuff.

763
00:41:40,949 --> 00:41:41,550
Where's the eye?

764
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,429
Is it going to eye on this?

765
00:41:47,019 --> 00:41:47,980
That comes across here.

766
00:41:49,849 --> 00:41:50,650
I feel like this is going to hurt.

767
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:53,769
Is there a better place for me to, let me kill the eye.

768
00:41:53,809 --> 00:41:55,010
I know it exists somewhere over here.

769
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:04,849
Cause you can get rid of this purple stuff.

770
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,110
That's lying to you.

771
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,070
No, there's no eye.

772
00:42:12,619 --> 00:42:13,139
Oh, it's okay.

773
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:15,760
Fine.

774
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,179
Is there a better place to grab it from?

775
00:42:20,179 --> 00:42:20,500
I wonder.

776
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:20,780
Hold on.

777
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,219
Let me go up here.

778
00:42:25,969 --> 00:42:28,010
The backseat dream stream.

779
00:42:28,409 --> 00:42:40,469
This is windy.

780
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:46,940
Grab.

781
00:42:49,500 --> 00:43:01,800
Oh, um, is there a place I can shit?

782
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:07,320
Is there no spot I can go up?

783
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,260
I don't think there is up here.

784
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:13,460
All right.

785
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:14,820
So I have to, I have to kill something then.

786
00:43:17,329 --> 00:43:17,849
No jump.

787
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:19,210
Why are you?

788
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:21,610
No, I want to just jump backwards.

789
00:43:22,409 --> 00:43:24,889
I want to just jump backwards, but of course not.

790
00:43:25,929 --> 00:43:27,170
Oh my God.

791
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:34,469
I wanted to just jump backwards, but I'm not facing the exact perfect angle to go

792
00:43:34,469 --> 00:43:34,829
back.

793
00:43:38,769 --> 00:43:39,849
I have to save the game too.

794
00:43:39,849 --> 00:43:50,219
Somebody just said, all right, where's the eye?

795
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:57,969
Tell me you should heal.

796
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:01,690
I'll eat a banana.

797
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:02,170
That sounds good.

798
00:44:06,579 --> 00:44:07,300
Oh, everyone's lying.

799
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:07,820
There is no eye.

800
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:08,059
Okay.

801
00:44:08,059 --> 00:44:08,300
All right.

802
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,260
So don't, don't trust chat.

803
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:09,579
I get it.

804
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:10,940
There's no eye.

805
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:12,789
How do I get up there then?

806
00:44:20,769 --> 00:44:21,530
I'm the stump.

807
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,860
Um, I need to buy food if I can or harvest some food.

808
00:44:28,369 --> 00:44:33,579
This just is what just gives you hearts and whatever.

809
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:38,480
Is there a place I can go from?

810
00:44:49,889 --> 00:44:51,289
I bet if I get up here, I can do it.

811
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,219
You'd find a safe spot.

812
00:45:12,329 --> 00:45:15,570
If there is an eye, it's going to be in some weird random place, isn't it?

813
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:19,369
But maybe I just can't get up there unless I do something in particular.

814
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,619
There's an eye behind you.

815
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:27,030
Not it right there.

816
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:27,349
Is it?

817
00:45:29,019 --> 00:45:29,980
Did I just see it right there?

818
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:31,940
It's right there.

819
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:32,300
It's right there.

820
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:32,619
It's right there.

821
00:45:32,619 --> 00:45:33,059
It's right there.

822
00:45:34,329 --> 00:45:35,809
Look at, look at how hidden this is.

823
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:37,969
What?

824
00:45:42,269 --> 00:45:43,269
Did you see how hidden that was?

825
00:45:54,789 --> 00:45:55,110
Good to go.

826
00:45:55,389 --> 00:46:07,659
Oh, please don't fall.

827
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,679
I wanted to jump backwards.

828
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:18,840
How do you just jump?

829
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:33,460
I pressed just B and he just fell down.

830
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,019
He didn't jump backwards.

831
00:46:35,019 --> 00:46:35,980
By the way, I win.

832
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:52,510
I fall down here.

833
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:57,809
Can I ask you a backseat question?

834
00:46:57,809 --> 00:46:59,050
How do you just drop?

835
00:47:00,179 --> 00:47:01,900
Cause when I press B, he jumps up.

836
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:03,340
How do I just let go?

837
00:47:03,949 --> 00:47:04,670
It's X, right?

838
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:06,489
Of course it is.

839
00:47:07,809 --> 00:47:09,409
How do I, how do I jump backwards?

840
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,360
Is it down in B?

841
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:16,000
It is.

842
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:16,480
Okay.

843
00:47:17,619 --> 00:47:19,980
But you have to be doing it the right, so it's not down in B.

844
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:23,059
It's like, if I was facing like over there, it'd be left in B.

845
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:31,719
Can I make it?

846
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:42,579
All right.

847
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:42,940
I got it.

848
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:58,989
That took 25 minutes.

849
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:06,909
He's not going to beat Ganon.

850
00:48:07,389 --> 00:48:07,909
Watch me.

851
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:16,079
I can't wait till the credits roll and all the people that bet against

852
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:17,280
me are just seething.

853
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:34,730
There we go.

854
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:37,659
So we're going.

855
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:40,090
Oh, look at that.

856
00:48:40,809 --> 00:48:42,769
Now I know exactly where the hell I can go.

857
00:48:43,369 --> 00:48:44,409
This thing's on an Island.

858
00:48:44,409 --> 00:48:45,050
I didn't know that.

859
00:48:47,449 --> 00:48:48,989
All right, here we go.

860
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:50,559
What else is over here?

861
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,400
I think we're just gliding over there.

862
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:00,789
I'm gliding to that shrine over there.

863
00:49:15,489 --> 00:49:15,769
Look at that.

864
00:49:15,809 --> 00:49:16,130
Perfect.

865
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:35,000
Remember, if you get to the last hour, please just go right to Ganon.

866
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:44,750
Even if I'm in the middle of doing this, go immediately to Ganon when

867
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:45,269
they're, all right.

868
00:49:45,309 --> 00:49:51,900
So what at 335, I have to go right to Ganon no matter what.

869
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:53,139
That's actually really funny.

870
00:49:55,579 --> 00:49:56,340
All right, well, here we are.

871
00:49:59,469 --> 00:50:02,550
There's a shrine here and the thing I need to do is right here.

872
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:03,110
It's right here.

873
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:06,769
What's the best way to get in here?

874
00:50:06,769 --> 00:50:07,769
This way around here.

875
00:50:10,139 --> 00:50:10,500
Maybe this.

876
00:50:10,579 --> 00:50:10,860
Okay.

877
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:11,699
Top left, maybe.

878
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:19,599
All right.

879
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:20,199
There's a bridge over here.

880
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:32,519
Wait, does this do anything?

881
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,070
It's not like a thing I can activate, right?

882
00:50:40,429 --> 00:50:40,909
Get away from me.

883
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:43,940
All right.

884
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:45,460
There's the bridge up into there.

885
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:47,300
And then I start that divine beast.

886
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:52,139
I'll have a solid, probably hour and 25 minutes, hour and 30 minutes to beat it.

887
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,260
I do need to buy stuff.

888
00:50:55,659 --> 00:50:58,780
I need to buy arrows and I need to buy, um, I need to get some heals.

889
00:51:10,849 --> 00:51:11,090
All right.

890
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:13,929
I think I made decent time going that way.

891
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:19,190
Fight Ganon blindfolded.

892
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:21,230
Well, we're not, we're not doing that today.

893
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:37,389
Have you done Hyrule castle at all?

894
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:39,110
I don't think so.

895
00:51:40,409 --> 00:51:41,130
Hey, staples.

896
00:51:44,829 --> 00:51:45,150
All right.

897
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:51,210
I am going, I actually, I'm going to take a minute to kind of, I need to get the horse.

898
00:51:51,329 --> 00:51:51,889
I'll do that.

899
00:51:52,289 --> 00:51:54,889
We'll actually keep the horse this time and not just throw away.

900
00:52:03,219 --> 00:52:05,300
I do want to get at least somewhat prepared.

901
00:52:17,579 --> 00:52:19,980
So can I buy stuff from you?

902
00:52:20,019 --> 00:52:21,139
Just like a general store, right?

903
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:22,789
I wonder, can I?

904
00:52:26,989 --> 00:52:28,469
No, you have to pay for this.

905
00:52:28,469 --> 00:52:29,469
No, no, no, no.

906
00:52:29,469 --> 00:52:30,190
Is there a store here?

907
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:39,659
This is just the stables and in a beetle was beetle is beetle random.

908
00:52:40,059 --> 00:52:40,500
I think beetle.

909
00:52:40,739 --> 00:52:41,139
Oh no, no, no.

910
00:52:41,139 --> 00:52:41,500
You're right here.

911
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:41,699
Okay.

912
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:47,730
All right.

913
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:48,010
What do you got?

914
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:52,880
Uh, all right.

915
00:52:53,889 --> 00:52:55,130
Incredibly important.

916
00:52:55,329 --> 00:52:56,650
I need a ton of these, right?

917
00:52:58,059 --> 00:53:08,019
I should get as many arrows as I can physically carry by every arrow.

918
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:12,869
All right.

919
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:14,789
I'm going to buy every single arrow.

920
00:53:14,829 --> 00:53:15,789
These are expensive.

921
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:25,039
Okay.

922
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:26,119
What about this stuff?

923
00:53:28,219 --> 00:53:28,539
Reset.

924
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:28,780
Okay.

925
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:29,539
Cold resist.

926
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:30,300
I'm going to get all these.

927
00:53:31,969 --> 00:53:32,170
Okay.

928
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:33,769
With monster parts for an elixir.

929
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:35,230
Give me them all.

930
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:39,699
Okay.

931
00:53:40,699 --> 00:53:49,130
Uh, temporarily maxed stamina, quiet movement.

932
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:52,110
I don't think, I don't think I need that.

933
00:53:53,219 --> 00:53:59,949
Now let me go make some cold resist up over here.

934
00:54:04,329 --> 00:54:04,530
All right.

935
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:06,170
The monster parts.

936
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:09,960
All right.

937
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:15,389
Uh, ingredient, any of these wings, higher quality, or just just by just

938
00:54:15,389 --> 00:54:22,289
different properties, explode electricity.

939
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:24,329
I have a few of these frogs already.

940
00:54:28,099 --> 00:54:28,619
Okay.

941
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:31,210
So I want to make an elixir.

942
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:33,190
That's monster parts.

943
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:35,639
The thing I just got up with some carrots.

944
00:54:42,219 --> 00:54:42,420
Okay.

945
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:43,179
Where are those?

946
00:54:43,699 --> 00:54:43,980
What are they?

947
00:54:44,179 --> 00:54:45,780
Butterflies or something or moths?

948
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:46,099
What are they?

949
00:54:46,099 --> 00:54:46,460
Where are they?

950
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:53,369
There's a thing I just bought.

951
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:55,019
Oh, here they get down here.

952
00:54:58,340 --> 00:54:58,539
All right.

953
00:54:58,539 --> 00:54:59,500
So how many of these should I hold?

954
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,139
Just one?

955
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:02,940
Or should I put five of these in here?

956
00:55:06,099 --> 00:55:09,820
Should I just make one with a bunch of random stuff or do four with all five?

957
00:55:10,179 --> 00:55:10,739
Do them all.

958
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:13,710
Four with a, with a monster part or with guts.

959
00:55:14,869 --> 00:55:15,110
Hell yeah.

960
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:15,510
Let's go.

961
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:18,809
Uh, any type of guts I should use?

962
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,860
I mean, this is, this thing's pretty, pretty good.

963
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:29,539
Would everybody be all right with this?

964
00:55:33,909 --> 00:55:35,309
It needs to be guts, not tail.

965
00:55:39,989 --> 00:55:40,510
How about this?

966
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:45,920
This looks pretty good.

967
00:55:59,260 --> 00:55:59,539
All right.

968
00:55:59,539 --> 00:56:02,500
That's high level cold resist.

969
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:04,690
The other thing.

970
00:56:06,489 --> 00:56:07,210
What do you mean we got them?

971
00:56:07,809 --> 00:56:08,780
Oh my God.

972
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:09,579
Wait, was that bad?

973
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:12,269
Now just go, go, go, go, go.

974
00:56:12,269 --> 00:56:12,510
All right.

975
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:12,750
All right.

976
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:12,949
All right.

977
00:56:12,949 --> 00:56:13,190
Right.

978
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:14,179
Okay.

979
00:56:14,179 --> 00:56:14,820
Now go.

980
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:17,440
All right.

981
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,480
I'm going, I'm going.

982
00:56:25,179 --> 00:56:25,380
All right.

983
00:56:25,619 --> 00:56:26,500
That's going to make it to the bridge.

984
00:56:27,139 --> 00:56:27,900
I can't turn.

985
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:28,739
I can't turn.

986
00:56:28,739 --> 00:56:29,820
I can't turn.

987
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:32,300
How do you control the horse in this game?

988
00:56:33,059 --> 00:56:34,139
I can't turn.

989
00:56:40,429 --> 00:56:42,699
Go on the bridge.

990
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:02,300
Oh my God.

991
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:03,420
Why?

992
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:12,179
That was so outrageous.

993
00:57:17,519 --> 00:57:18,719
It's a horse on a bridge.

994
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:19,519
Leave him alone.

995
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:21,079
I, yeah, that is like kind of scary.

996
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:26,539
He's outraged right now.

997
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:29,179
All right, here we go.

998
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:30,300
It's time to start the mission.

999
00:57:34,059 --> 00:57:34,219
All right.

1000
00:57:34,219 --> 00:57:34,659
You know what?

1001
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:35,300
I'm getting off.

1002
00:57:35,739 --> 00:57:36,739
I'm getting off the horse.

1003
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:40,539
Not only does the horse not like bridges, the horse just

1004
00:57:40,539 --> 00:57:42,980
wants to go on a straight line off the cliff.

1005
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,900
I'm not about that right now.

1006
00:57:58,599 --> 00:58:00,000
Oh, he is not about that.

1007
00:58:02,719 --> 00:58:03,079
Cool.

1008
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:04,659
All right.

1009
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:13,739
So what's the strategy here?

1010
00:58:13,739 --> 00:58:14,340
How do we get up there?

1011
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:19,219
I don't understand what's going on, dude.

1012
00:58:19,219 --> 00:58:20,579
Didn't you kill that guy in one shot?

1013
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:22,619
Oh, earlier.

1014
00:58:22,619 --> 00:58:22,940
Yeah.

1015
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:24,539
I got through phase one really quickly.

1016
00:58:24,539 --> 00:58:25,300
It's a speed run strat.

1017
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:29,539
Uh, phase two is when the, the actual like ceiling fans start turning on.

1018
00:58:31,179 --> 00:58:32,699
Uh, which allows them to go a little bit higher.

1019
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:34,139
So it's phase two.

1020
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:36,820
Really a keen eye you have there though.

1021
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:37,500
Really keen eye.

1022
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:41,239
Okay.

1023
00:58:41,239 --> 00:58:41,960
Here we are.

1024
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:42,880
Rito village.

1025
00:58:44,929 --> 00:58:46,690
I know there's not time to talk, but there is.

1026
00:58:48,579 --> 00:58:49,659
Now's not a good time.

1027
00:58:50,019 --> 00:58:50,380
Where am I?

1028
00:58:51,219 --> 00:58:54,460
This is Rito village, but well, you could say we're not in a welcoming mood.

1029
00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:55,750
Okay.

1030
00:59:00,789 --> 00:59:02,630
So we have to go.

1031
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:03,869
I'm imagining probably up here at the top.

1032
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:07,710
Blow the dust out of your switch, bro.

1033
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:20,460
I think, I think that's just how this game runs.

1034
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:23,139
All right.

1035
00:59:23,139 --> 00:59:24,420
This is really important.

1036
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:26,139
Is it anything that I need from here?

1037
00:59:29,230 --> 00:59:29,909
More arrows.

1038
00:59:29,909 --> 00:59:30,349
I'll take them.

1039
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:38,139
Three arrows for 60 bucks.

1040
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:41,070
Oh, it's a bundle.

1041
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:41,269
Okay.

1042
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:49,360
Oh, it's expensive.

1043
00:59:51,809 --> 00:59:53,849
I'm imagining this probably gear I should get too.

1044
00:59:56,929 --> 00:59:57,730
I want to check that out first.

1045
01:00:03,289 --> 01:00:04,010
All right.

1046
01:00:05,309 --> 01:00:07,070
Snow quill trousers.

1047
01:00:08,190 --> 01:00:08,909
Cold resist.

1048
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:13,030
Five, three, cold resist.

1049
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:13,269
Okay.

1050
01:00:13,269 --> 01:00:14,989
So which one has the most cold resist?

1051
01:00:14,989 --> 01:00:15,389
Does it matter?

1052
01:00:15,389 --> 01:00:15,989
Are they all the same?

1053
01:00:18,389 --> 01:00:18,989
He's broke.

1054
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:20,030
I have enough of the Chesapease.

1055
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:22,639
What do I got on right now?

1056
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:25,570
Have the, okay.

1057
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:26,650
This is the swimming ones.

1058
01:00:27,289 --> 01:00:28,889
I want to keep the bandana on.

1059
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:35,360
Okay.

1060
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,559
This one's good.

1061
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:40,760
Uh, I'm going to buy it.

1062
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:46,920
I should, I need to upgrade this.

1063
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,360
This thing is terrible.

1064
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:49,920
Oh no, it's not.

1065
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:50,320
13.

1066
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:50,760
That's good.

1067
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:51,480
Yeah.

1068
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:51,840
Put it on.

1069
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:52,199
That's fine.

1070
01:00:54,809 --> 01:00:55,489
Do some selling.

1071
01:00:58,110 --> 01:00:58,909
I could sell some stuff.

1072
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:01,250
What should I sell?

1073
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:08,559
Dude, I'm selling this.

1074
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:09,840
Oh, it's only 15.

1075
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:10,320
Nevermind.

1076
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:18,300
Selling my exclusive Nintendo switch shirt for 15 coins.

1077
01:01:19,619 --> 01:01:21,539
I have a lot of Tophaz.

1078
01:01:25,539 --> 01:01:26,780
I'm just gonna sell like 10 of these.

1079
01:01:28,099 --> 01:01:28,460
Five?

1080
01:01:29,219 --> 01:01:30,380
Sell all the gems.

1081
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:31,099
Sell all of them.

1082
01:01:31,099 --> 01:01:32,699
You look at all these gems you got.

1083
01:01:33,619 --> 01:01:34,340
I'm going to keep one of each.

1084
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:38,059
1600 bucks.

1085
01:01:46,219 --> 01:01:46,860
Holy shit.

1086
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:48,099
I'm rich right now.

1087
01:01:48,739 --> 01:01:50,340
You're never going to use these for any reason.

1088
01:01:51,929 --> 01:01:52,210
Okay.

1089
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:52,530
True.

1090
01:01:53,889 --> 01:01:56,130
You guys got to, you have to absolutely gas me up for this.

1091
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:58,090
I need every, I need every move.

1092
01:01:58,730 --> 01:02:00,489
I need all the incredibly expensive shit.

1093
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:02,409
I want all the best gear in the whole game.

1094
01:02:02,409 --> 01:02:03,969
Like I got five grand now.

1095
01:02:03,969 --> 01:02:04,409
Where do I get it?

1096
01:02:13,219 --> 01:02:13,539
Okay.

1097
01:02:16,550 --> 01:02:17,590
Uh, I'm, I'm good.

1098
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:17,869
I'm good.

1099
01:02:17,869 --> 01:02:18,190
I'm good.

1100
01:02:19,829 --> 01:02:20,190
I'm good.

1101
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:21,429
I'm not selling everything.

1102
01:02:21,429 --> 01:02:21,630
No.

1103
01:02:21,909 --> 01:02:22,429
There's no reason to.

1104
01:02:26,969 --> 01:02:27,170
Okay.

1105
01:02:27,329 --> 01:02:28,409
I'm getting these and I'm going to get pants.

1106
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,650
I could go to the, that area.

1107
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:38,519
All right.

1108
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:45,000
So, horsepower fire to make cold climates more tolerable.

1109
01:02:48,099 --> 01:02:48,300
All right.

1110
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:50,380
So I am now completely resistant to cold.

1111
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,719
Is there anything else I should buy that I should really get?

1112
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:04,829
Get the bomb arrows.

1113
01:03:05,429 --> 01:03:06,429
I was going to say that too.

1114
01:03:07,349 --> 01:03:09,190
I was thinking it, I just didn't say it out loud.

1115
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:15,289
You're a potato streamer.

1116
01:03:16,409 --> 01:03:16,730
That's all right.

1117
01:03:16,889 --> 01:03:17,250
I don't care.

1118
01:03:19,739 --> 01:03:23,460
Potatoes are fucking incredibly easy to like make and eat and stuff.

1119
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,000
They're, they're, they're good.

1120
01:03:28,039 --> 01:03:28,480
They're healthy.

1121
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:29,000
They're filling.

1122
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:30,199
Who cares?

1123
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:31,159
Yeah.

1124
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,519
Why are you saying that like the bad thing?

1125
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:33,840
The butter too.

1126
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:34,119
Yeah.

1127
01:03:34,119 --> 01:03:34,360
Fine.

1128
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:43,900
I'll take one.

1129
01:03:57,969 --> 01:03:59,570
Actually, I'm just getting this cause it's food.

1130
01:04:09,289 --> 01:04:16,050
Oh, you can't eat wheat.

1131
01:04:16,289 --> 01:04:17,449
I can combine it with stuff.

1132
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:28,440
So he said, keep it moving.

1133
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:30,480
Keep it moving.

1134
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:31,480
Okay.

1135
01:04:37,130 --> 01:04:43,610
Oh, did you say I've never seen somebody spend $3,000 on food ever in this game?

1136
01:04:46,570 --> 01:04:47,849
Yeah, but they weren't up against the clock.

1137
01:04:58,539 --> 01:04:59,500
Oh, hold on a second.

1138
01:04:59,500 --> 01:04:59,940
Look at this.

1139
01:05:01,179 --> 01:05:04,780
I need to unlock the shrine.

1140
01:05:08,090 --> 01:05:09,730
Is there anything over here that I can teleport to?

1141
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:10,570
That's not the shrine.

1142
01:05:13,179 --> 01:05:15,179
That's a good, let me actually get the quest first.

1143
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:16,179
Here we go.

1144
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:16,860
All right, let's go.

1145
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:17,219
Let's do it.

1146
01:05:19,809 --> 01:05:20,130
Welcome.

1147
01:05:20,210 --> 01:05:21,809
Oh, an object on your hip.

1148
01:05:21,849 --> 01:05:22,530
Could it be?

1149
01:05:23,289 --> 01:05:23,690
Forgive me.

1150
01:05:23,690 --> 01:05:24,050
Where am I?

1151
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:24,289
Man?

1152
01:05:24,929 --> 01:05:27,849
I am Kenobi elder of Rito village.

1153
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:30,480
How then?

1154
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:33,639
Is that not a sheikah slate dangling from your hip?

1155
01:05:36,210 --> 01:05:36,969
Oh my.

1156
01:05:36,969 --> 01:05:37,929
So it is true.

1157
01:05:39,699 --> 01:05:42,539
It means you must be a champion like master Revali.

1158
01:05:43,099 --> 01:05:46,219
One of the few able to board divine beast of Midor.

1159
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:49,980
What am I thinking?

1160
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:52,619
The champions have all been dead for a hundred years.

1161
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:58,300
Boy must have, must be a mere descendant and inheritor of the sheikah slate.

1162
01:05:59,619 --> 01:06:00,300
Ah, forgive me.

1163
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:01,179
Let me listen.

1164
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:03,539
If you would listen to this old man's request, would you have to give my

1165
01:06:03,539 --> 01:06:04,019
eternal gratitude?

1166
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:04,659
Sure.

1167
01:06:04,659 --> 01:06:04,940
Listen.

1168
01:06:06,139 --> 01:06:08,420
Now that I know that you have a champion, there's something I must ask you.

1169
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:09,780
How should I put this?

1170
01:06:10,539 --> 01:06:13,340
I would like you to deal with the giant beast cycling above us.

1171
01:06:14,019 --> 01:06:15,659
Only a chosen one champion can stop a champion beast.

1172
01:06:15,699 --> 01:06:16,900
You must enter the beast and bring him to me.

1173
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:19,750
I explained this to you, more headstrong Rito warriors, but

1174
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:20,590
they wouldn't listen to what I did.

1175
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:25,929
Tiba and Hearth tried to confront Midor, but it did not go well.

1176
01:06:25,929 --> 01:06:27,050
And Hearth was injured.

1177
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:31,619
Tiba escaped unscathed, but I fear he now plans to face Midor alone.

1178
01:06:33,219 --> 01:06:33,579
That's it.

1179
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:35,860
You get it.

1180
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:36,500
All right.

1181
01:06:36,539 --> 01:06:37,579
Find Tiba.

1182
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:41,659
If you work together, you may be able to stop divine beast Va-Midor.

1183
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:46,190
Okay.

1184
01:06:54,449 --> 01:06:56,929
Forgive my intrusion, but I overheard you speaking with the elder.

1185
01:06:58,170 --> 01:07:01,769
Sounds like you intend to help my husband Tiba in the fight against Midor.

1186
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:06,239
But to tell you the truth, there's not much I can do for you right now.

1187
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:07,880
Beyond telling you where my husband went.

1188
01:07:08,199 --> 01:07:08,400
All right.

1189
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:08,719
Where'd he go?

1190
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:15,059
Well, my husband headed to a place called the flight range.

1191
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:19,659
It's in Drawnox pass at the base of the Hebra mountains.

1192
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:22,699
It's a place where Rito warriors prepare for aerial combat.

1193
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:25,739
It's gone there to gather weapons for another run at Midor.

1194
01:07:26,829 --> 01:07:29,989
As it happens, he made his way to the flight range on foot this time.

1195
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:36,949
You take off from Revali's landing.

1196
01:07:37,349 --> 01:07:39,150
It's a straight shot down to the flight range.

1197
01:07:40,949 --> 01:07:43,550
Revali's landing is a memorial for the Rito champion, Revali.

1198
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:46,650
Okay.

1199
01:07:47,449 --> 01:07:47,690
All right.

1200
01:07:47,929 --> 01:07:48,329
I'm ready.

1201
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:53,739
How much pizza do I eat a year?

1202
01:07:55,099 --> 01:07:56,019
Um, let's do the math.

1203
01:07:57,670 --> 01:08:01,300
We got, let's say like one to two pizzas a month.

1204
01:08:02,099 --> 01:08:03,940
Maybe like one pizza a month, baby.

1205
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:08,579
12, maybe 12 to 15 pizzas a year.

1206
01:08:13,369 --> 01:08:13,650
Depends.

1207
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:19,220
Those are rookie numbers.

1208
01:08:22,710 --> 01:08:23,430
Sometimes it's more.

1209
01:08:23,510 --> 01:08:23,829
Depends.

1210
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:31,960
Impressive.

1211
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:32,479
I know.

1212
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,520
Very few can achieve a mastery of the sky.

1213
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:36,199
Okay, cool.

1214
01:08:36,359 --> 01:08:39,960
Yet I have made an art of creating an updraft that allows me to

1215
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:40,279
solve.

1216
01:08:40,279 --> 01:08:41,760
Oh, this is where I'm going to learn how to get it.

1217
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:45,159
Considered to be quite the masterpiece of aerial techniques, even among the Rito.

1218
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:50,600
With proper utilization of my superior skills, I see no reason why we couldn't

1219
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:51,079
easily.

1220
01:08:51,119 --> 01:08:53,600
Didn't I get really mad at flying last time?

1221
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:59,630
My ability to explore the firmament is certainly of note, but let's not pardon

1222
01:08:59,630 --> 01:09:00,630
me for being so blunt.

1223
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:03,390
Let's not forget the fact that I am the most skilled archer of all

1224
01:09:03,390 --> 01:09:03,989
the Rito.

1225
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:10,840
Yet despite these truths, it seems that I've been tapped to merely assist you all

1226
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:14,800
because you happen to have that little darkness ceiling sword on your back.

1227
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:15,720
The master sword, right?

1228
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,640
I mean, I'm glad I picked that up.

1229
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:19,119
Just asinine.

1230
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:23,600
Unless you think you can prove me wrong.

1231
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:26,680
Maybe we should just settle this one on one.

1232
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:28,560
All right, but where?

1233
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,199
Oh, I know.

1234
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:31,840
How about up there?

1235
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:38,819
Oh, you must pardon me.

1236
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:43,340
I forgot you have no way of making it up to that divine beast on your own.

1237
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:48,939
So so you don't have wings and I do.

1238
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:49,659
Ha ha ha.

1239
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:06,300
OK, wait, what's happened?

1240
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:07,819
Are you all right?

1241
01:10:08,699 --> 01:10:09,460
My apologies.

1242
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:11,020
I fear I have said far too much.

1243
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:12,460
Is there anything you do not understand?

1244
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:13,460
Please do not hesitate.

1245
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:18,260
All right, let's go.

1246
01:10:20,739 --> 01:10:23,930
Or is that that's nothing I can literally.

1247
01:10:24,289 --> 01:10:27,329
I can fly there very easily.

1248
01:10:29,619 --> 01:10:32,180
Let me get the shrine, though.

1249
01:10:33,810 --> 01:10:36,390
I don't want to have to run back here.

1250
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:38,520
Where is it?

1251
01:10:39,079 --> 01:10:42,989
It's beeping.

1252
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:43,630
Where is it, though?

1253
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,159
Back seaters, I need your help.

1254
01:10:51,979 --> 01:10:52,500
Oh, there it is.

1255
01:10:55,430 --> 01:10:56,670
Stop wasting time.

1256
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:58,069
I am not wasting time.

1257
01:10:58,069 --> 01:10:59,149
I've got plenty of time.

1258
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:01,520
I've got two.

1259
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:03,960
I've got two full hours.

1260
01:11:07,689 --> 01:11:10,170
There might even be time to have a snack.

1261
01:11:17,619 --> 01:11:18,220
OK, cool.

1262
01:11:20,579 --> 01:11:21,739
Then we got to go that way.

1263
01:11:22,739 --> 01:11:23,539
You know what I'm doing?

1264
01:11:25,789 --> 01:11:28,029
I need to cook this food, though.

1265
01:11:29,189 --> 01:11:30,789
I need a fire to cook the food,

1266
01:11:30,789 --> 01:11:31,829
even though I do have some.

1267
01:11:31,949 --> 01:11:32,909
I do have some meals.

1268
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:35,100
Wait, are you going to tell me

1269
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:35,579
that I can do this?

1270
01:11:36,479 --> 01:11:37,399
I don't want to hear a story.

1271
01:11:37,399 --> 01:11:37,840
I'm sorry.

1272
01:11:40,090 --> 01:11:40,970
I don't think I can make that.

1273
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:43,319
Give him up top.

1274
01:11:47,579 --> 01:11:48,100
What?

1275
01:11:49,689 --> 01:11:50,210
I don't know.

1276
01:11:50,930 --> 01:11:52,010
But now all of a sudden,

1277
01:11:52,010 --> 01:11:52,689
you guys don't care

1278
01:11:52,689 --> 01:11:53,729
about the time constraint.

1279
01:11:55,109 --> 01:11:57,069
Five seconds ago, it was hurry up.

1280
01:11:57,390 --> 01:11:58,270
Hurry up, dummy.

1281
01:11:58,989 --> 01:12:00,109
And now all of a sudden it's

1282
01:12:00,109 --> 01:12:01,229
I want to hear the story.

1283
01:12:10,489 --> 01:12:11,050
Can I make this?

1284
01:12:14,779 --> 01:12:15,699
I think I can get up here.

1285
01:12:16,909 --> 01:12:19,640
I promise this will shave time somehow.

1286
01:12:24,069 --> 01:12:25,189
I promise this will shave

1287
01:12:25,189 --> 01:12:25,829
a little bit of time

1288
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:33,500
so we get a place where I can stand,

1289
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,060
which I think I think I can stand up here.

1290
01:12:41,739 --> 01:12:42,659
Looks like I can, right?

1291
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:46,220
Sometimes it lets you just.

1292
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:48,579
It's not.

1293
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:50,060
Come on, right there.

1294
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:50,659
There's a lip right here.

1295
01:13:17,539 --> 01:13:18,739
OK, now from here,

1296
01:13:18,739 --> 01:13:19,619
I'm going to glide across

1297
01:13:19,619 --> 01:13:20,220
the entire thing

1298
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:36,130
and walk on this for sure.

1299
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:38,960
I can't. No way.

1300
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:41,000
I can definitely walk right there.

1301
01:13:44,039 --> 01:13:45,199
No way I can definitely land on that.

1302
01:13:48,899 --> 01:13:53,270
Good. And now

1303
01:13:53,949 --> 01:13:54,869
I don't need to go all the way up.

1304
01:13:56,510 --> 01:13:57,550
I just wanted to do this.

1305
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:20,800
I definitely shaved off

1306
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:21,800
some time it had to over.

1307
01:14:34,609 --> 01:14:35,649
You would have made it without climbing.

1308
01:14:35,649 --> 01:14:36,289
I don't think I would have.

1309
01:14:37,409 --> 01:14:38,449
I just jumped off that dock.

1310
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:41,819
Look at that. And here we are.

1311
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:47,170
OK, so here's the thing.

1312
01:14:47,170 --> 01:14:48,890
If I do beat, if I OK,

1313
01:14:49,130 --> 01:14:50,090
if I get to Ganon

1314
01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:52,460
with an hour remaining,

1315
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:53,260
maybe I have enough time

1316
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:54,180
to load those shrines.

1317
01:15:01,949 --> 01:15:03,029
OK, we got that.

1318
01:15:03,029 --> 01:15:03,470
Here we go.

1319
01:15:04,229 --> 01:15:05,229
I do want to heal.

1320
01:15:05,890 --> 01:15:07,130
That's definitely smart.

1321
01:15:07,250 --> 01:15:08,250
What food can I eat?

1322
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:08,850
That's not going to

1323
01:15:09,930 --> 01:15:10,850
this is just cold resist.

1324
01:15:10,850 --> 01:15:11,850
I should eat this right now.

1325
01:15:13,369 --> 01:15:14,369
Low level cold resist.

1326
01:15:14,369 --> 01:15:15,130
I get the hearts back.

1327
01:15:17,449 --> 01:15:17,850
Why not?

1328
01:15:18,510 --> 01:15:18,989
I'm going to eat it.

1329
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:26,409
Oh, I got the master sword.

1330
01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:31,850
I got targets to shoot at.

1331
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:42,800
Hyrule Castle is going to

1332
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,119
take him two days.

1333
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:47,489
No, it's not.

1334
01:15:49,939 --> 01:15:50,739
And a free bow.

1335
01:15:53,770 --> 01:15:54,850
All right. So what bow

1336
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:55,970
do I have right now

1337
01:15:55,970 --> 01:15:57,130
that I just need to get rid of?

1338
01:15:58,050 --> 01:15:59,449
Which is the worst bow that I have.

1339
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:01,680
This thing's almost dead.

1340
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:02,880
So why not just use it?

1341
01:16:11,659 --> 01:16:12,220
Cook the wheat.

1342
01:16:12,220 --> 01:16:13,180
Yeah, I'll cook all the food here.

1343
01:16:13,220 --> 01:16:13,579
Yeah.

1344
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:16,539
Hmm.

1345
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:19,300
I need to find this person.

1346
01:16:20,930 --> 01:16:22,010
I don't know you.

1347
01:16:22,609 --> 01:16:24,449
And I'm actually pretty busy here.

1348
01:16:24,729 --> 01:16:26,050
You should probably go.

1349
01:16:39,449 --> 01:16:44,470
I'm going to cook and put some

1350
01:16:44,909 --> 01:16:45,229
some.

1351
01:16:45,869 --> 01:16:46,470
It doesn't matter.

1352
01:16:49,619 --> 01:16:50,659
So many materials.

1353
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:52,500
And I just buy a bunch of wheat.

1354
01:16:52,539 --> 01:16:52,899
Where is it?

1355
01:16:59,890 --> 01:17:00,649
There's a little bit of butter.

1356
01:17:09,390 --> 01:17:10,029
One of these.

1357
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:12,340
Another one of these.

1358
01:17:12,659 --> 01:17:12,899
Sure.

1359
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:13,340
Why not?

1360
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:31,189
Oh, and I'll do that one more time.

1361
01:17:31,859 --> 01:17:32,220
I have another.

1362
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:33,020
I have a couple.

1363
01:17:42,579 --> 01:17:43,180
I just want the heart.

1364
01:17:49,699 --> 01:17:52,550
Up in there.

1365
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:54,460
All right.

1366
01:17:54,899 --> 01:17:57,270
I I don't care about cooking.

1367
01:17:57,270 --> 01:17:57,949
I have I have.

1368
01:17:58,229 --> 01:17:58,630
I'll beat it.

1369
01:18:02,229 --> 01:18:02,470
All right.

1370
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:03,109
So what's the deal here?

1371
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:15,619
My name's Link.

1372
01:18:20,439 --> 01:18:21,520
Oh, by the way, stay tuned

1373
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:22,840
because I'm going to be beating

1374
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:25,279
punch out every regular circuit

1375
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:27,199
without falling down more than once.

1376
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:28,800
So if you want to see that,

1377
01:18:29,199 --> 01:18:29,960
I would stay tuned.

1378
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,640
That's when the the lower right

1379
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:38,359
corner of me with my arms crossed

1380
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,399
kind of superimposed green screen

1381
01:18:40,399 --> 01:18:41,039
in the bottom right.

1382
01:18:42,210 --> 01:18:44,050
It's like and at eight o'clock

1383
01:18:44,050 --> 01:18:47,420
central, the punch out challenge.

1384
01:18:48,779 --> 01:18:49,460
And then it goes away

1385
01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:50,300
after like 10 seconds.

1386
01:18:57,369 --> 01:18:58,289
You should take your time.

1387
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:03,779
OK.

1388
01:19:04,630 --> 01:19:06,029
Once Divine Beast Van Madoe

1389
01:19:06,029 --> 01:19:07,550
falls from the sky.

1390
01:19:08,069 --> 01:19:09,939
If I have to kill Madoe, so be it.

1391
01:19:12,470 --> 01:19:12,750
All right.

1392
01:19:12,789 --> 01:19:13,189
Let's go.

1393
01:19:13,710 --> 01:19:14,069
We can do it.

1394
01:19:19,699 --> 01:19:20,460
As the elder said,

1395
01:19:20,619 --> 01:19:21,659
the only way to stop

1396
01:19:21,659 --> 01:19:23,100
Divine Beast Van Madoe

1397
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:24,340
is to get inside of it.

1398
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:26,100
Bad chance of that happening.

1399
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:27,859
There's no way we can set foot in Madoe.

1400
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:29,720
Actually.

1401
01:19:30,199 --> 01:19:31,600
Wait, did I actually this guy?

1402
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:34,579
So not only are you wingless,

1403
01:19:34,579 --> 01:19:35,779
you're brainless, too.

1404
01:19:41,119 --> 01:19:42,720
Oh, I am one of the five champions.

1405
01:19:43,119 --> 01:19:43,800
Let me tell you.

1406
01:19:44,119 --> 01:19:47,199
It hadn't been Ganon.

1407
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:48,359
Never mind.

1408
01:19:48,359 --> 01:19:50,680
Let's focus on bringing down Madoe

1409
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:51,880
one step at a time.

1410
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:53,520
If we approach Madoe recklessly,

1411
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:55,279
its cannons will blast us out of the sky

1412
01:19:55,279 --> 01:19:56,239
before we can even get close.

1413
01:19:57,689 --> 01:19:58,770
I need to test you

1414
01:19:58,770 --> 01:19:59,770
before I can take you with me.

1415
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:03,430
We Rito warriors use the updraft

1416
01:20:03,550 --> 01:20:04,510
in this ravine

1417
01:20:04,829 --> 01:20:06,670
to hone our aerial archery skills.

1418
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:09,699
The updrafts are so strong here

1419
01:20:09,699 --> 01:20:10,380
that a person could.

1420
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:11,460
I'm going to fail this a lot.

1421
01:20:11,819 --> 01:20:13,579
So you just leave.

1422
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:20,800
Some of you are debating.

1423
01:20:21,819 --> 01:20:22,979
Some of you are debating on like,

1424
01:20:22,979 --> 01:20:24,100
oh, man, maybe he'll get this done

1425
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:24,899
in like 30 minutes.

1426
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:27,439
Now is the time for you

1427
01:20:27,439 --> 01:20:28,399
just to go do laundry

1428
01:20:29,039 --> 01:20:31,199
or make lunch or something or dinner.

1429
01:20:32,350 --> 01:20:32,909
When you come back,

1430
01:20:32,909 --> 01:20:33,789
I'll still be here, don't worry.

1431
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:36,310
All right, the updrafts

1432
01:20:36,310 --> 01:20:37,550
are so strong here that you can.

1433
01:20:37,829 --> 01:20:38,350
Yeah, yeah.

1434
01:20:39,350 --> 01:20:42,100
Let's go destroy all five targets

1435
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:43,100
in three hours.

1436
01:20:44,260 --> 01:20:44,619
You got it.

1437
01:21:01,859 --> 01:21:02,819
I just shot three.

1438
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:03,659
Hold on a minute.

1439
01:21:03,659 --> 01:21:04,779
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1440
01:21:04,779 --> 01:21:06,100
I don't want to shoot three arrows

1441
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:07,340
at the same fucking time.

1442
01:21:07,699 --> 01:21:09,060
I want to shoot one arrow.

1443
01:21:10,409 --> 01:21:10,930
How do I go back?

1444
01:21:15,069 --> 01:21:15,949
It only uses one.

1445
01:21:16,939 --> 01:21:32,819
Oh, I can think broken my hands.

1446
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:37,460
What's the second worst bow?

1447
01:21:39,550 --> 01:21:39,909
This one.

1448
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:50,720
Perfect.

1449
01:21:54,350 --> 01:21:55,109
I really hope that wasn't

1450
01:21:55,109 --> 01:21:55,949
shooting more than one arrow.

1451
01:21:56,270 --> 01:22:08,069
Uh-huh.

1452
01:22:08,069 --> 01:22:09,350
You must have seen a battle or two.

1453
01:22:09,510 --> 01:22:10,189
I've seen a few.

1454
01:22:10,189 --> 01:22:11,630
It's not brag here.

1455
01:22:12,699 --> 01:22:13,739
I can tell just by looking at you.

1456
01:22:13,739 --> 01:22:14,539
Don't be modest.

1457
01:22:15,529 --> 01:22:16,729
You'll have heard the name somewhere.

1458
01:22:16,729 --> 01:22:17,170
Link.

1459
01:22:18,170 --> 01:22:18,850
Well, if you really want to

1460
01:22:18,850 --> 01:22:19,890
help me bring down Madoa,

1461
01:22:19,890 --> 01:22:20,850
it's now or never.

1462
01:22:21,329 --> 01:22:22,600
Let's get you into position

1463
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:23,640
so you can give its cannons

1464
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:24,239
all you got.

1465
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:24,600
All right.

1466
01:22:25,699 --> 01:22:26,859
Inside that treasure

1467
01:22:26,859 --> 01:22:28,739
chest is a bow I've modified.

1468
01:22:28,739 --> 01:22:29,500
Take it and let me know

1469
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:29,979
when you're ready.

1470
01:22:35,399 --> 01:22:36,239
Falcon bow.

1471
01:22:36,979 --> 01:22:39,300
Highly refined Rito made bow

1472
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:41,220
created by a master Rito craftsman.

1473
01:22:41,619 --> 01:22:42,979
Rito Warriors favorite

1474
01:22:42,979 --> 01:22:44,420
for its superior rate of fire.

1475
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:46,479
Oh, that's pretty good.

1476
01:22:51,189 --> 01:22:51,989
This thing's awesome.

1477
01:22:51,989 --> 01:22:52,510
Look at this thing.

1478
01:22:56,810 --> 01:22:57,890
OK, is it on fire now?

1479
01:22:58,289 --> 01:22:59,050
Were there arrows in here?

1480
01:22:59,050 --> 01:23:00,489
I could take or take them already.

1481
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:02,359
Free bow.

1482
01:23:06,319 --> 01:23:06,880
All right, I'm ready.

1483
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:07,920
Let's go.

1484
01:23:10,199 --> 01:23:10,800
You guys ready?

1485
01:23:13,619 --> 01:23:14,699
I need bomb arrows.

1486
01:23:14,699 --> 01:23:15,060
All right.

1487
01:23:18,439 --> 01:23:19,640
You just give me 20 of these.

1488
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:21,199
These things that you just gave me

1489
01:23:22,649 --> 01:23:23,850
like five grand.

1490
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:27,439
I'm good.

1491
01:23:27,439 --> 01:23:28,600
I already got food in me.

1492
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:30,399
I've already got good clothes on.

1493
01:23:32,529 --> 01:23:33,250
Why are you doing this?

1494
01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:34,850
Why risk your life to bring down the dough?

1495
01:23:36,130 --> 01:23:42,420
Or it's for a bet to rescue Zelda.

1496
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:43,979
The name of the princess

1497
01:23:43,979 --> 01:23:45,939
Revelle served 100 years ago

1498
01:23:45,939 --> 01:23:46,899
at Hyrule Castle.

1499
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:52,579
As long as you're helping me

1500
01:23:52,579 --> 01:23:53,340
bring down the dough,

1501
01:23:53,619 --> 01:23:54,939
your motivation is fine by me.

1502
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:57,439
Let's go.

1503
01:23:57,439 --> 01:23:58,399
All right, so let's do it.

1504
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:00,159
Let me save the game first.

1505
01:24:03,039 --> 01:24:05,079
This is all about just landing shots.

1506
01:24:05,079 --> 01:24:05,880
I'm going to try really hard.

1507
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:06,560
I'm not going to fuck around.

1508
01:24:14,939 --> 01:24:16,140
OK, just hit the targets.

1509
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:17,140
It's showtime.

1510
01:24:19,399 --> 01:24:22,039
OK, so what do I need to hit the cannons?

1511
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:26,579
There's divine beast,

1512
01:24:26,579 --> 01:24:27,619
Ven Madoe,

1513
01:24:28,699 --> 01:24:30,300
and it has its barrier up again.

1514
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:31,020
What a pain.

1515
01:24:31,659 --> 01:24:33,350
It's wrong to scared.

1516
01:24:36,579 --> 01:24:37,739
See those cannons?

1517
01:24:37,979 --> 01:24:39,500
I'll draw their fire.

1518
01:24:40,180 --> 01:24:40,739
While I'm doing that,

1519
01:24:40,739 --> 01:24:41,579
use your bomb arrows

1520
01:24:41,579 --> 01:24:42,500
to destroy the cannons.

1521
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:42,819
Got it.

1522
01:24:43,060 --> 01:24:43,380
I got it.

1523
01:24:44,659 --> 01:24:46,180
If you need to withdraw for a bit,

1524
01:24:46,180 --> 01:24:47,619
just spread your cloth

1525
01:24:47,619 --> 01:24:48,939
and float straight up

1526
01:24:48,939 --> 01:24:50,300
into the updraft for a while.

1527
01:24:50,539 --> 01:24:51,420
I'll take that as a sign

1528
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:52,380
that we need to regroup.

1529
01:24:52,979 --> 01:24:54,260
Don't bother aiming for anything

1530
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:55,340
covered by the barrier.

1531
01:24:56,180 --> 01:24:56,859
Whatever you do,

1532
01:24:56,859 --> 01:24:58,300
don't get close enough to touch it.

1533
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:00,300
Well, that would be on you

1534
01:25:01,470 --> 01:25:02,430
because I'm not the one.

1535
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:03,670
You're I'm on.

1536
01:25:04,069 --> 01:25:04,869
I'm on top of you.

1537
01:25:05,109 --> 01:25:05,310
All right.

1538
01:25:05,310 --> 01:25:06,869
Finally, I know I said this a few times.

1539
01:25:07,470 --> 01:25:08,270
I have cold on.

1540
01:25:11,220 --> 01:25:11,659
Let's go.

1541
01:25:14,770 --> 01:25:16,010
Now blow up those cannons.

1542
01:25:16,529 --> 01:25:17,810
What the fuck is happening?

1543
01:25:22,689 --> 01:25:23,449
Can you come back?

1544
01:25:24,989 --> 01:25:25,829
Holding up OK.

1545
01:25:26,069 --> 01:25:27,029
Get over here.

1546
01:25:27,310 --> 01:25:27,949
Why did I come?

1547
01:25:27,949 --> 01:25:28,949
Why did I fall off?

1548
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:33,960
Let's go.

1549
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:35,399
Why did I jump off?

1550
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:36,600
It's on you.

1551
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:37,560
What is happening?

1552
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:38,760
I thought I was supposed

1553
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:39,640
to be riding on him.

1554
01:25:45,109 --> 01:25:45,710
How do I change?

1555
01:25:46,630 --> 01:25:48,710
How do I change the arrow

1556
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:58,600
that I have missing?

1557
01:26:08,319 --> 01:26:08,880
Is it alive?

1558
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:10,079
That's it.

1559
01:26:10,439 --> 01:26:10,840
OK, we're good.

1560
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:12,840
I thought I was staying on his back.

1561
01:26:15,659 --> 01:26:17,739
I was feeling there.

1562
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:30,720
You can't hit the shit in the air,

1563
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:31,399
can you know?

1564
01:26:37,289 --> 01:26:38,130
Oh, sorry.

1565
01:26:38,130 --> 01:26:38,770
Did you miss?

1566
01:26:39,689 --> 01:26:40,449
He's shit.

1567
01:26:46,930 --> 01:26:47,689
One of the top, maybe.

1568
01:26:56,670 --> 01:26:57,149
I think I can probably

1569
01:26:57,149 --> 01:26:57,630
hit this from here.

1570
01:26:58,229 --> 01:26:58,789
I aim it right.

1571
01:27:07,609 --> 01:27:08,210
I'll do the same thing.

1572
01:27:08,210 --> 01:27:08,770
I said, you know,

1573
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:13,600
I think I can hit it from here.

1574
01:27:20,420 --> 01:27:22,819
Yeah, I got it.

1575
01:27:34,779 --> 01:27:35,260
Is that all of them?

1576
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:35,739
Or is there one more?

1577
01:27:36,539 --> 01:27:37,380
Somewhere in the front, I bet.

1578
01:27:37,380 --> 01:27:58,229
Yep, let's go.

1579
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:03,460
Now he's going to get inside, right?

1580
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:19,020
Well done, Link.

1581
01:28:20,380 --> 01:28:21,659
That thing is history.

1582
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:24,260
That's a two hour puzzle session.

1583
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:26,539
Oh, coming up, you mean.

1584
01:28:33,029 --> 01:28:34,670
It'll be 45 minutes to beat this.

1585
01:28:36,989 --> 01:28:37,390
Whatever.

1586
01:28:38,739 --> 01:28:39,939
This one doesn't look that big.

1587
01:28:42,819 --> 01:28:45,420
This does not look as large

1588
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:46,380
as the other ones were inside.

1589
01:28:47,060 --> 01:28:55,739
News, Link.

1590
01:28:56,220 --> 01:28:57,020
Looks like I got hit

1591
01:28:57,020 --> 01:28:58,060
pretty good back there.

1592
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:00,899
I think I think I need to get back

1593
01:29:00,899 --> 01:29:01,899
to the flight doesn't know.

1594
01:29:01,899 --> 01:29:02,979
Is this actually a Pepe laugh?

1595
01:29:02,979 --> 01:29:03,979
That's I just hope that

1596
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:05,340
I can make it back.

1597
01:29:05,939 --> 01:29:07,260
You head down to me.

1598
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:12,979
Look, it's all you.

1599
01:29:13,659 --> 01:29:23,699
Pepe laugh.

1600
01:29:38,270 --> 01:29:38,949
Remember, can you wish me

1601
01:29:38,949 --> 01:29:40,430
a good day at school today?

1602
01:29:49,850 --> 01:29:51,689
Take a day off school.

1603
01:29:57,159 --> 01:29:58,680
Someday the weekend.

1604
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:00,760
You mean for tomorrow?

1605
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:03,000
Well, now I've seen that face before.

1606
01:30:05,510 --> 01:30:07,470
I had a feeling you would show up

1607
01:30:07,470 --> 01:30:09,470
eventually, but making me

1608
01:30:09,550 --> 01:30:12,630
probably five years is a bit indulgent.

1609
01:30:12,630 --> 01:30:13,510
Sunday school.

1610
01:30:13,909 --> 01:30:16,310
Have a good day at Sunday school.

1611
01:30:20,329 --> 01:30:22,930
You're I'm against clock right now.

1612
01:30:22,930 --> 01:30:23,729
Hold on, correct?

1613
01:30:26,829 --> 01:30:28,430
If so, then the first thing

1614
01:30:28,430 --> 01:30:30,029
you'll want to do is find yourself.

1615
01:30:30,229 --> 01:30:32,069
He thinks America is the only country.

1616
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:37,670
It's EU is not in school right now.

1617
01:30:38,489 --> 01:30:40,609
Maybe Asia, Australia,

1618
01:30:42,369 --> 01:30:44,329
Australia from here is plus 14.

1619
01:30:44,930 --> 01:30:45,609
I don't think it's it.

1620
01:30:45,890 --> 01:30:47,289
I don't think it's school time for Australia.

1621
01:30:51,060 --> 01:30:52,579
Is it where you wait?

1622
01:30:52,579 --> 01:30:54,180
It is like it's like 6 a.m.

1623
01:30:54,180 --> 01:30:55,420
right now in Australia.

1624
01:30:57,699 --> 01:30:58,699
Hey, OK.

1625
01:30:59,590 --> 01:31:02,659
Hey, have a good day at school.

1626
01:31:14,420 --> 01:31:16,020
OK, I'm I got to I got to play.

1627
01:31:16,979 --> 01:31:19,100
So do we have to do

1628
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:20,260
anything weird with this one?

1629
01:31:24,359 --> 01:31:25,279
Divine, because there's

1630
01:31:25,279 --> 01:31:27,079
no weird shit to do.

1631
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:28,119
It's not like, oh,

1632
01:31:28,119 --> 01:31:29,399
I have to move the elephant.

1633
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:30,600
Whatever I have to move

1634
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:31,479
the trunk up and down.

1635
01:31:31,479 --> 01:31:32,640
It's not anything like that, right?

1636
01:31:33,159 --> 01:31:36,859
And I want that, whatever that is.

1637
01:31:43,220 --> 01:31:44,859
I have to just touch all those things.

1638
01:31:47,739 --> 01:31:52,579
I mean, all the way up.

1639
01:31:52,939 --> 01:31:57,859
It's up here.

1640
01:31:58,020 --> 01:31:59,140
I can keep going up

1641
01:32:05,420 --> 01:32:07,300
and I open the map of the.

1642
01:32:07,340 --> 01:32:08,100
I don't think I can.

1643
01:32:11,750 --> 01:32:15,229
All right, I need to find those kiosks.

1644
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:23,039
Is it not up in this top?

1645
01:32:23,479 --> 01:32:23,920
Oh, wait.

1646
01:32:26,310 --> 01:32:27,750
At what point do I go too high up

1647
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:28,550
and I lose

1648
01:32:29,109 --> 01:32:30,829
gravity of the divine beast

1649
01:32:30,829 --> 01:32:31,350
or whatever it is?

1650
01:32:31,470 --> 01:32:31,949
Does it matter?

1651
01:32:49,130 --> 01:32:49,770
OK, well.

1652
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:54,739
I'm just going to go down here

1653
01:32:56,699 --> 01:32:57,859
to get the map first.

1654
01:32:57,899 --> 01:32:59,420
I'm sorry I was wishing somebody

1655
01:32:59,420 --> 01:33:00,699
good luck in Sunday school.

1656
01:33:01,420 --> 01:33:02,819
I was a little distracted, sorry.

1657
01:33:03,739 --> 01:33:04,619
I got to go to the map room.

1658
01:33:05,260 --> 01:33:17,760
OK, how do you swing?

1659
01:33:18,079 --> 01:33:18,880
I'm going to swing.

1660
01:33:26,689 --> 01:33:27,050
Here we go.

1661
01:33:49,060 --> 01:33:49,819
Somebody just said,

1662
01:33:50,180 --> 01:33:52,619
what is this boring ass game?

1663
01:33:54,319 --> 01:33:55,239
All right, come on, dude.

1664
01:33:55,819 --> 01:33:56,739
You can you can.

1665
01:33:56,779 --> 01:33:58,100
You would think that Zelda is boring,

1666
01:33:58,739 --> 01:34:00,220
but you know what the game is.

1667
01:34:00,619 --> 01:34:01,180
Do you know what I mean?

1668
01:34:01,180 --> 01:34:02,659
Like you have to know what the game is.

1669
01:34:04,010 --> 01:34:05,130
You know, this is Zelda.

1670
01:34:05,689 --> 01:34:07,050
I mean, you might think the game sucks.

1671
01:34:07,170 --> 01:34:07,729
That's all right.

1672
01:34:07,729 --> 01:34:09,010
Everybody has their own games.

1673
01:34:09,010 --> 01:34:10,210
They like to look closely,

1674
01:34:10,210 --> 01:34:11,050
but it's Zelda.

1675
01:34:11,289 --> 01:34:11,890
You know what it is.

1676
01:34:15,039 --> 01:34:16,520
The terminals that will activate

1677
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:17,560
Meadow are marked

1678
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:18,920
by those glowing points.

1679
01:34:19,850 --> 01:34:21,050
You'll need to agree with him.

1680
01:34:21,050 --> 01:34:22,609
All of the terminals to take.

1681
01:34:22,649 --> 01:34:23,289
No, I would.

1682
01:34:23,529 --> 01:34:24,090
No, I'm just.

1683
01:34:24,689 --> 01:34:26,100
Think you're right.

1684
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:27,220
Thanks for defending us.

1685
01:34:27,859 --> 01:34:28,220
I was.

1686
01:34:28,300 --> 01:34:28,979
Wait, people think.

1687
01:34:29,300 --> 01:34:29,979
Was I agreeing?

1688
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:36,939
He's agreeing with him.

1689
01:34:40,079 --> 01:34:40,760
OK, all right.

1690
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:41,039
All right.

1691
01:34:41,039 --> 01:34:41,279
All right.

1692
01:34:41,279 --> 01:34:42,079
No, we're good.

1693
01:34:42,079 --> 01:34:42,399
We're good.

1694
01:34:42,399 --> 01:34:42,760
We're good.

1695
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:45,479
I have to move some things around.

1696
01:34:47,090 --> 01:34:47,609
Oops.

1697
01:34:48,930 --> 01:34:49,489
Oh, fuck.

1698
01:34:49,529 --> 01:34:50,489
This could take all day.

1699
01:34:52,069 --> 01:34:52,829
How was I ever going

1700
01:34:52,829 --> 01:34:53,630
to beat this in three hours?

1701
01:35:04,420 --> 01:35:05,260
Don't say that yet.

1702
01:35:05,619 --> 01:35:16,590
OK, so it's either.

1703
01:35:16,829 --> 01:35:19,090
OK, it's either up middle.

1704
01:35:20,649 --> 01:35:22,210
Tilts, you tilt it.

1705
01:35:22,329 --> 01:35:22,810
I get it.

1706
01:35:22,810 --> 01:35:23,890
So you can either tilt

1707
01:35:23,890 --> 01:35:24,729
left or tilt right.

1708
01:35:28,140 --> 01:35:29,699
Let me just take a quick look.

1709
01:35:30,899 --> 01:35:31,899
Oh, fuck.

1710
01:35:32,659 --> 01:35:33,460
Oh, no, we're good.

1711
01:35:33,699 --> 01:35:36,420
I don't want to shoot

1712
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:37,260
bomb arrows, though.

1713
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:45,260
Just.

1714
01:35:48,819 --> 01:35:49,699
Just go in again and do this.

1715
01:35:49,699 --> 01:35:50,659
No way you're going to be this puzzle.

1716
01:35:51,510 --> 01:35:52,550
I think no, I'm all right.

1717
01:35:52,550 --> 01:35:52,869
I'm all right.

1718
01:35:52,869 --> 01:35:53,710
I just need to actually sit here

1719
01:35:53,710 --> 01:35:55,590
and pay attention for real.

1720
01:36:00,899 --> 01:36:01,819
Can I try that?

1721
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:05,600
All right, hold on.

1722
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:12,220
Can I shoot that?

1723
01:36:20,890 --> 01:36:22,409
I'm going to I'm going to shoot this.

1724
01:36:23,819 --> 01:36:24,460
Save the game.

1725
01:36:26,119 --> 01:36:27,199
It's been a long time.

1726
01:36:31,449 --> 01:36:32,210
Just go to Ganon.

1727
01:36:32,569 --> 01:36:33,770
I mean, I'm I'm here right now.

1728
01:36:35,909 --> 01:36:37,029
This is a really bad idea.

1729
01:36:45,850 --> 01:36:46,729
I don't even know why I did that.

1730
01:36:49,109 --> 01:36:50,270
Is there anything I can fly up with?

1731
01:36:59,779 --> 01:37:00,140
Hold on.

1732
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:02,100
Can I get can I grab on or something?

1733
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:04,300
Oh, God, not to the helicopter, please.

1734
01:37:11,619 --> 01:37:12,100
OK, we're good.

1735
01:37:16,369 --> 01:37:17,250
So if it tells this way,

1736
01:37:17,250 --> 01:37:18,609
I can freeze them, I bet.

1737
01:37:23,739 --> 01:37:24,699
Chest down there.

1738
01:37:24,699 --> 01:37:25,739
I go this way.

1739
01:37:30,689 --> 01:37:31,649
The bird is so small.

1740
01:37:31,649 --> 01:37:35,920
Where is all this stuff up?

1741
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:45,819
Like we're this way.

1742
01:37:51,289 --> 01:37:54,069
They're like in the wings.

1743
01:37:56,659 --> 01:37:58,779
We're in the way down below.

1744
01:38:12,989 --> 01:38:13,750
That gets me over here.

1745
01:38:16,579 --> 01:38:17,260
Why did you do that?

1746
01:38:18,659 --> 01:38:19,180
Look at this.

1747
01:38:22,649 --> 01:38:25,350
Wait, I can't walk up.

1748
01:38:29,989 --> 01:38:35,500
All right, so now I'm in here

1749
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:36,500
and I'm going to tell it this way.

1750
01:38:40,550 --> 01:38:41,229
No, I did.

1751
01:38:41,630 --> 01:38:41,989
Yes.

1752
01:38:43,069 --> 01:39:10,399
So this one right up here is one.

1753
01:39:16,289 --> 01:39:18,250
There are four terminals remaining.

1754
01:39:18,770 --> 01:39:20,050
Still no ways to go.

1755
01:39:25,369 --> 01:39:25,770
OK.

1756
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:29,100
Oh, I'm going to make it flat.

1757
01:39:30,220 --> 01:39:41,899
So the next one is in the left.

1758
01:39:42,140 --> 01:39:43,420
Is it like a little bunker

1759
01:39:43,420 --> 01:39:44,020
or something over here?

1760
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:47,800
I'm going to get attacked, aren't I?

1761
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:51,680
What are these things for?

1762
01:39:58,750 --> 01:40:02,119
All right, all right.

1763
01:40:19,979 --> 01:40:20,779
Stop the spawning.

1764
01:40:22,420 --> 01:40:22,859
What does this do?

1765
01:40:28,899 --> 01:40:30,340
OK, and open up the windows.

1766
01:40:30,819 --> 01:40:31,619
Get some fresh air.

1767
01:40:32,619 --> 01:40:34,899
That is doing what?

1768
01:40:48,930 --> 01:40:49,850
Is that going to stay open?

1769
01:41:01,140 --> 01:41:02,020
All right, hold on a second.

1770
01:41:03,529 --> 01:41:05,609
So if I go like this

1771
01:41:06,369 --> 01:41:10,670
and then which direction

1772
01:41:10,670 --> 01:41:11,430
should I move it this way?

1773
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:21,500
Oh, shit, things are moving.

1774
01:41:23,380 --> 01:41:24,819
I just press this big button

1775
01:41:27,020 --> 01:41:29,659
and now do I close it

1776
01:41:29,659 --> 01:41:30,380
if I close it?

1777
01:41:30,380 --> 01:41:31,579
Will the no hold on

1778
01:41:31,939 --> 01:41:33,579
that close that gate?

1779
01:41:40,229 --> 01:41:44,619
What is if I close the window

1780
01:41:44,899 --> 01:41:45,979
that closes that?

1781
01:41:46,340 --> 01:41:48,699
Now this is stuck here,

1782
01:41:49,989 --> 01:41:52,399
which then I just I don't

1783
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:53,640
what's the goal here?

1784
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:54,239
I don't know.

1785
01:41:55,949 --> 01:41:56,869
I'm about to float out the window

1786
01:41:56,869 --> 01:41:58,630
to the Hyrule Castle, by the way.

1787
01:41:59,770 --> 01:42:00,770
I'm about to just go out the window

1788
01:42:00,770 --> 01:42:01,729
out, float out the window

1789
01:42:01,729 --> 01:42:02,569
to Hyrule Castle

1790
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:13,159
because I need to get in here.

1791
01:42:13,199 --> 01:42:15,520
So how do I what button opens that?

1792
01:42:18,359 --> 01:42:19,199
And what do I have to press

1793
01:42:19,199 --> 01:42:20,239
to open this door?

1794
01:42:29,140 --> 01:42:30,380
Button's not pressed all the way.

1795
01:42:44,300 --> 01:42:45,619
Do I tilt the bird?

1796
01:42:47,909 --> 01:42:48,909
Because this presses the button

1797
01:42:48,909 --> 01:42:49,590
in all the way.

1798
01:42:50,829 --> 01:42:52,270
But what does that actually even do?

1799
01:42:52,270 --> 01:42:53,390
It closes this.

1800
01:42:55,789 --> 01:42:56,550
No, it is.

1801
01:43:01,220 --> 01:43:01,579
It doesn't.

1802
01:43:01,579 --> 01:43:02,699
It needs to go faster.

1803
01:43:06,939 --> 01:43:08,500
All right, I'm very confused.

1804
01:43:11,039 --> 01:43:11,880
I'm opening this again.

1805
01:43:18,789 --> 01:43:20,069
It would be blue if it was pressed.

1806
01:43:20,069 --> 01:43:21,029
So do I have to make it go

1807
01:43:21,029 --> 01:43:23,630
like super speed down?

1808
01:43:23,829 --> 01:43:24,149
Hold on.

1809
01:43:24,149 --> 01:43:24,630
What if I turn?

1810
01:43:30,859 --> 01:43:31,979
OK, so I have to get rid of that

1811
01:43:32,460 --> 01:43:35,130
because that's blocking this.

1812
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:37,140
That's OK.

1813
01:43:37,140 --> 01:43:37,699
There it goes.

1814
01:43:39,029 --> 01:43:41,590
Now we make it go to the right

1815
01:43:41,909 --> 01:43:43,510
and it's going to be going wicked fast.

1816
01:43:43,590 --> 01:43:43,869
Hold on.

1817
01:43:50,119 --> 01:43:52,220
Oh, OK.

1818
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:53,899
Now I have to freeze

1819
01:43:54,899 --> 01:43:56,020
my freezing the door.

1820
01:44:00,239 --> 01:44:01,479
What am I actually freezing here?

1821
01:44:04,579 --> 01:44:05,819
Freeze on the fan.

1822
01:44:06,699 --> 01:44:07,579
This one here, right?

1823
01:44:08,899 --> 01:44:10,460
And then tilt it, freeze this

1824
01:44:10,460 --> 01:44:11,500
so it'll move all the way over.

1825
01:44:13,619 --> 01:44:14,619
Freeze the metal block.

1826
01:44:15,180 --> 01:44:15,699
I don't think I can.

1827
01:44:16,060 --> 01:44:20,260
Freeze the square metal block.

1828
01:44:20,539 --> 01:44:24,100
So then now I tilt it

1829
01:44:25,159 --> 01:44:25,680
all the way up.

1830
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:37,510
Oh, oh shit.

1831
01:44:37,510 --> 01:44:37,789
Wait.

1832
01:44:44,060 --> 01:44:44,539
I got it.

1833
01:44:44,539 --> 01:44:44,859
I got it.

1834
01:44:45,220 --> 01:44:45,699
I got it.

1835
01:44:45,699 --> 01:44:47,380
It's it's it's it's weird.

1836
01:44:47,380 --> 01:44:47,739
It's weird.

1837
01:44:47,739 --> 01:44:48,380
It's a puzzle.

1838
01:44:48,380 --> 01:44:49,020
It takes a minute.

1839
01:45:10,590 --> 01:45:10,989
Try it again.

1840
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:18,010
Wait, waiting.

1841
01:45:18,010 --> 01:45:18,529
Keep waiting.

1842
01:45:18,529 --> 01:45:19,010
Keep waiting.

1843
01:45:19,010 --> 01:45:19,489
Keep waiting.

1844
01:45:19,489 --> 01:45:19,970
Keep waiting.

1845
01:45:19,970 --> 01:45:20,449
Keep waiting.

1846
01:45:20,449 --> 01:45:20,930
Keep waiting.

1847
01:45:20,930 --> 01:45:21,369
Keep waiting.

1848
01:45:21,369 --> 01:45:21,770
Keep waiting.

1849
01:45:21,770 --> 01:45:22,170
Keep waiting.

1850
01:45:22,170 --> 01:45:22,489
Keep waiting.

1851
01:45:22,489 --> 01:45:22,810
Keep waiting.

1852
01:45:22,810 --> 01:45:24,250
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1853
01:45:26,439 --> 01:45:27,720
I don't get this at all.

1854
01:45:29,289 --> 01:45:29,489
Wait.

1855
01:45:32,180 --> 01:45:34,020
What what am I not getting here?

1856
01:45:35,619 --> 01:45:35,939
What?

1857
01:45:36,619 --> 01:45:37,779
I don't even need to do that at all.

1858
01:45:46,359 --> 01:45:47,680
What is actually happening?

1859
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:51,239
What is what is making this great go down?

1860
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:55,800
Does that thing have to go all the way to the other side?

1861
01:45:56,039 --> 01:45:58,880
I actually don't understand how this is the mechanics of how this works.

1862
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:11,729
What is making the gate go up?

1863
01:46:11,729 --> 01:46:14,619
So turning it again this way.

1864
01:46:16,460 --> 01:46:18,220
Why wouldn't I want to just keep it right here?

1865
01:46:24,630 --> 01:46:26,029
How come it's doing that?

1866
01:46:26,029 --> 01:46:33,869
I just like get it.

1867
01:46:33,909 --> 01:46:40,390
Use the magnesis on the block so the fan can keep spinning.

1868
01:46:40,470 --> 01:46:41,510
Oh, it's not enough to freeze it.

1869
01:46:43,260 --> 01:46:45,020
I completely forgot this was an item in the game.

1870
01:46:49,770 --> 01:46:52,010
I completely forgot the magnet existed.

1871
01:46:54,180 --> 01:46:54,739
God damn it.

1872
01:46:56,760 --> 01:46:58,600
I literally can just go like this.

1873
01:46:59,359 --> 01:47:05,060
All right, well, let's try it again.

1874
01:47:06,090 --> 01:47:09,119
But now if I hold this, keep it right here.

1875
01:47:12,380 --> 01:47:13,300
Hey, look at that.

1876
01:47:14,949 --> 01:47:16,390
How come you keep forgetting this is in the game?

1877
01:47:16,989 --> 01:47:20,670
Because I do this really fun thing where I play Breath of the Wild every six months.

1878
01:47:21,609 --> 01:47:23,210
And then I don't play it for six months.

1879
01:47:31,550 --> 01:47:39,140
All right, six is generous.

1880
01:47:41,609 --> 01:47:43,529
There are three terminals remaining.

1881
01:47:44,010 --> 01:47:44,729
Keep going.

1882
01:47:45,689 --> 01:47:48,500
OK, can I get them all in a row?

1883
01:47:51,329 --> 01:47:51,770
No. All right.

1884
01:47:51,770 --> 01:47:53,449
We just got to get the other side.

1885
01:47:53,449 --> 01:47:58,100
There's three on the other side.

1886
01:47:58,100 --> 01:47:59,140
Turn it this way.

1887
01:48:01,930 --> 01:48:03,250
But what are we looking at here?

1888
01:48:03,250 --> 01:48:05,329
I got to get up there.

1889
01:48:05,329 --> 01:48:17,149
Cure that guy real quick over there.

1890
01:48:23,689 --> 01:48:26,170
Wait, I want that one.

1891
01:48:26,170 --> 01:48:28,050
I can't. I have no patience at all.

1892
01:48:28,810 --> 01:48:29,770
Like zero.

1893
01:48:29,770 --> 01:48:32,579
It's it goes to zero.

1894
01:48:32,579 --> 01:48:34,060
I was do I was doing it fine.

1895
01:48:34,060 --> 01:48:36,859
I just like my brain was like, I want to beat this so fast.

1896
01:48:38,359 --> 01:48:40,739
I don't want to wait for the bird to turn.

1897
01:48:40,739 --> 01:48:42,579
That's what was going through my head.

1898
01:48:42,579 --> 01:48:44,260
It's like I have to wait for the bird bird to turn.

1899
01:48:44,260 --> 01:48:45,340
It's going to take ten full seconds.

1900
01:48:45,340 --> 01:48:46,380
I don't want to wait.

1901
01:48:46,380 --> 01:49:03,180
OK, well, now I have to get back up there.

1902
01:49:03,180 --> 01:49:04,699
I got to get up there.

1903
01:49:04,699 --> 01:49:07,380
What's the best way to get up there?

1904
01:49:07,380 --> 01:49:09,060
Freezing this in the middle?

1905
01:49:09,060 --> 01:49:09,819
Yeah.

1906
01:49:36,510 --> 01:49:37,350
Then I'm going to head to the left.

1907
01:49:48,189 --> 01:49:48,710
Second part.

1908
01:49:50,779 --> 01:49:53,300
We've got you, hold on.

1909
01:50:02,470 --> 01:50:03,350
Get rid of the spawner.

1910
01:50:03,350 --> 01:50:05,590
All right, this is going to make this blow.

1911
01:50:12,920 --> 01:50:14,869
And what's happening?

1912
01:50:14,869 --> 01:50:23,970
I got to get up there.

1913
01:50:23,970 --> 01:50:25,369
Anything on the ceiling?

1914
01:50:25,369 --> 01:50:28,859
No, I think I know what to do.

1915
01:50:28,859 --> 01:50:30,260
Tilt it this way.

1916
01:50:30,260 --> 01:50:32,340
Maybe I can just fall in there.

1917
01:50:33,420 --> 01:50:35,699
I think I can just fall in and watch this, right?

1918
01:50:35,699 --> 01:50:46,420
I imagine that will work.

1919
01:50:46,420 --> 01:50:59,760
Will that work? Of course it does.

1920
01:51:02,920 --> 01:51:03,520
I almost got it.

1921
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:04,720
We're good.

1922
01:51:04,720 --> 01:51:06,239
I think we're on pretty good pace right now.

1923
01:51:06,239 --> 01:51:09,880
I've got I've got more than a full hour to begin.

1924
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:12,840
I'm going to have all the divine powers.

1925
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:16,369
I need to get through this door.

1926
01:51:16,369 --> 01:51:17,649
I'm almost there.

1927
01:51:22,250 --> 01:51:30,659
Yeah, it doesn't blow up by itself.

1928
01:51:30,659 --> 01:51:31,180
Right.

1929
01:51:43,029 --> 01:51:44,550
How do I explain that?

1930
01:51:44,550 --> 01:51:45,550
I can't explain it.

1931
01:51:45,550 --> 01:51:47,069
Just laugh at the dumb thing I did.

1932
01:51:47,069 --> 01:52:05,369
OK, nice.

1933
01:52:05,369 --> 01:52:09,329
All right, now we put a bomb in there.

1934
01:52:09,409 --> 01:52:11,680
Turn that off

1935
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:13,520
and we can pop that.

1936
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:14,720
That's just right.

1937
01:52:17,229 --> 01:52:20,710
No, really?

1938
01:52:20,710 --> 01:52:22,220
I can't.

1939
01:52:22,220 --> 01:52:34,460
Well, now what do I do?

1940
01:52:34,460 --> 01:52:35,539
Oh, come on.

1941
01:52:35,539 --> 01:52:36,300
I had it.

1942
01:52:36,300 --> 01:52:37,220
I did it right.

1943
01:52:37,220 --> 01:52:38,539
I had it.

1944
01:52:39,189 --> 01:52:51,060
No, we want to go this way.

1945
01:52:51,060 --> 01:52:58,390
OK, now I got to make it go that way.

1946
01:52:58,390 --> 01:52:59,189
I don't think I can.

1947
01:52:59,189 --> 01:53:02,489
Can I make it go that way?

1948
01:53:02,489 --> 01:53:06,029
Wait, I can.

1949
01:53:06,029 --> 01:53:09,000
OK, OK.

1950
01:53:11,479 --> 01:53:12,800
Very cool.

1951
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:15,760
Now, now we do this

1952
01:53:18,789 --> 01:53:21,109
and I do magnetism

1953
01:53:21,829 --> 01:53:23,149
through the wall.

1954
01:53:25,399 --> 01:53:27,800
No, I don't.

1955
01:53:31,850 --> 01:53:35,189
I do tilt.

1956
01:53:35,470 --> 01:53:36,510
Which way should I tilt?

1957
01:53:36,510 --> 01:53:37,510
This way?

1958
01:53:37,510 --> 01:53:38,750
No.

1959
01:53:38,750 --> 01:53:39,829
Pull it out.

1960
01:53:39,829 --> 01:53:41,710
I can get it here.

1961
01:53:41,710 --> 01:53:43,850
I'll move it this way.

1962
01:53:43,850 --> 01:53:45,609
Can I reach now?

1963
01:53:45,609 --> 01:53:53,619
Oh, get it on the track over there.

1964
01:53:58,770 --> 01:53:59,770
Come here.

1965
01:54:05,750 --> 01:54:08,810
OK, get it right here.

1966
01:54:09,529 --> 01:54:12,460
And we tilt it

1967
01:54:13,020 --> 01:54:28,550
that slam into it.

1968
01:54:33,180 --> 01:54:35,979
They only got this only two more.

1969
01:54:36,100 --> 01:54:38,420
This is actually much better than I thought it was.

1970
01:54:39,579 --> 01:54:45,060
We're good.

1971
01:54:45,060 --> 01:54:47,420
Just one terminal remaining.

1972
01:54:48,939 --> 01:54:51,859
What do you know?

1973
01:54:51,859 --> 01:54:53,899
One terminal and it's down.

1974
01:54:54,539 --> 01:55:00,779
It is down, down there, right below me.

1975
01:55:01,970 --> 01:55:04,989
OK, so what's the deal?

1976
01:55:05,949 --> 01:55:08,909
I think I'm going to open this and then go out of the window.

1977
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:12,439
Does that sound good?

1978
01:55:12,439 --> 01:55:24,930
Everybody, it's right underneath me.

1979
01:55:28,300 --> 01:55:35,060
I'm going to save it right now.

1980
01:55:35,060 --> 01:55:36,420
I feel like that's correct.

1981
01:55:36,420 --> 01:55:39,579
It probably isn't.

1982
01:55:39,579 --> 01:55:47,770
Is that not correct?

1983
01:55:47,770 --> 01:55:49,289
No, no, go this way.

1984
01:56:03,699 --> 01:56:05,100
It was not correct.

1985
01:56:05,100 --> 01:56:06,180
I didn't know if there was like a lip

1986
01:56:06,180 --> 01:56:11,890
because remember, there was a little lip over there.

1987
01:56:11,890 --> 01:56:13,649
All right, this is where I want to be.

1988
01:56:14,369 --> 01:56:17,449
So not above, but down to the left over there.

1989
01:56:17,449 --> 01:56:19,529
OK, so what the heck is going on over here?

1990
01:56:21,460 --> 01:56:22,859
Let's float in there.

1991
01:56:22,859 --> 01:56:23,659
Let's go.

1992
01:56:27,010 --> 01:56:34,939
OK, I'm going to eat something.

1993
01:56:34,939 --> 01:56:36,500
I'm going to keep the cold resistance going.

1994
01:56:36,500 --> 01:56:45,619
Yeah, that'll get rid of that.

1995
01:56:45,859 --> 01:56:48,020
It's pre-recorded.

1996
01:56:48,020 --> 01:57:07,289
No, it's that way.

1997
01:57:07,289 --> 01:57:13,520
Is there another one of those things on track?

1998
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:14,960
So I got to get in there.

1999
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:15,520
So wait a minute.

2000
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:17,779
Hold on. If I tilt this way,

2001
01:57:17,779 --> 01:57:21,050
I can probably float in there.

2002
01:57:21,050 --> 01:57:22,409
Ooh, I got it.

2003
01:57:22,409 --> 01:57:23,810
It's done. I just beat it.

2004
01:57:24,329 --> 01:57:26,449
And we still have an hour and 20 minutes.

2005
01:57:27,170 --> 01:57:35,779
I am doing just fine, by the way.

2006
01:57:35,779 --> 01:57:48,569
I don't think I can make it.

2007
01:57:48,569 --> 01:57:58,170
Yeah, yeah, that's them all.

2008
01:57:58,170 --> 01:57:59,050
I got them all.

2009
01:58:05,800 --> 01:58:06,960
Let's turn it on.

2010
01:58:07,560 --> 01:58:10,079
So what's the superpower you get from the bird?

2011
01:58:21,869 --> 01:58:23,149
Right in the middle.

2012
01:58:26,630 --> 01:58:28,159
This one wasn't that bad.

2013
01:58:28,159 --> 01:58:29,319
This one was fun.

2014
01:58:30,579 --> 01:58:31,699
This was a lot shorter

2015
01:58:31,699 --> 01:58:33,859
than the other ones, it seems like.

2016
01:58:33,859 --> 01:58:35,460
I liked it, though. It was fun.

2017
01:58:35,460 --> 01:58:53,140
Can I make this?

2018
01:58:53,140 --> 01:59:02,149
OK. All the way up.

2019
01:59:02,149 --> 01:59:05,260
Longer than the lizard, at least.

2020
01:59:05,260 --> 01:59:06,100
Did I hate the lizard?

2021
01:59:06,100 --> 01:59:10,300
I thought.

2022
01:59:10,300 --> 01:59:12,180
I should probably get to full health.

2023
01:59:12,180 --> 01:59:17,630
This is a boss.

2024
01:59:17,989 --> 01:59:19,869
Or close to full health.

2025
01:59:25,270 --> 01:59:27,979
All right. Get the master sword out.

2026
01:59:27,979 --> 01:59:33,090
It's not out already.

2027
01:59:33,090 --> 01:59:34,810
Master sword is here.

2028
01:59:34,810 --> 01:59:35,890
60 damage.

2029
01:59:35,890 --> 01:59:38,220
Holy shit.

2030
01:59:38,260 --> 01:59:40,260
And what do I have for a bow?

2031
01:59:40,920 --> 01:59:42,640
Falcon bow, that's fine.

2032
01:59:42,640 --> 01:59:46,579
What do I have for arrows?

2033
01:59:46,579 --> 01:59:47,659
I have a lot of bomb arrows

2034
01:59:47,659 --> 01:59:48,899
and maybe I'll use them.

2035
01:59:50,779 --> 01:59:54,000
OK, well, that was annoying.

2036
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:58,300
All right, are we ready? Let's go.

2037
01:59:58,300 --> 02:00:13,579
How do I turn it on?

2038
02:00:13,579 --> 02:00:14,819
Cannon.

2039
02:00:15,500 --> 02:00:20,579
Save the bombs for cannon.

2040
02:00:20,579 --> 02:00:23,449
I have to get a picture of that for sure.

2041
02:00:45,779 --> 02:00:46,779
OK.

2042
02:00:50,020 --> 02:00:53,260
Defeated me a hundred years ago.

2043
02:00:53,260 --> 02:00:56,020
Well, you see, when I played six months ago,

2044
02:00:56,460 --> 02:00:57,340
you know, I was OK.

2045
02:00:57,340 --> 02:00:57,979
I was good back then,

2046
02:00:57,979 --> 02:00:59,060
but I forgot how the game played.

2047
02:00:59,060 --> 02:01:00,460
I forgot the controls.

2048
02:01:00,460 --> 02:01:02,699
So it's your turn now.

2049
02:01:03,220 --> 02:01:04,579
I haven't played Breath of the Wild

2050
02:01:04,579 --> 02:01:07,020
in fucking a hundred years, Link.

2051
02:01:14,609 --> 02:01:36,140
Dodge?

2052
02:01:36,140 --> 02:01:38,359
These don't really hurt that much.

2053
02:01:38,359 --> 02:01:47,380
Ow.

2054
02:01:47,380 --> 02:01:51,810
I need to eat something.

2055
02:01:51,810 --> 02:01:53,949
What do I even have for food?

2056
02:01:53,949 --> 02:01:55,189
I got this.

2057
02:02:04,390 --> 02:02:07,460
I feel like I should have wasted all of this, but I did.

2058
02:02:07,460 --> 02:02:08,180
All right. No more.

2059
02:02:08,180 --> 02:02:08,899
OK, bomb arrows.

2060
02:02:08,899 --> 02:02:10,180
I'm not using them.

2061
02:02:21,970 --> 02:02:22,970
Where is he?

2062
02:02:24,140 --> 02:02:29,460
I just needed a complete 160 degrees

2063
02:02:30,920 --> 02:02:32,840
with 200 added on top of that.

2064
02:02:38,180 --> 02:02:39,420
Can I bring him down?

2065
02:02:39,859 --> 02:02:47,090
I feel like you have to see the gun or something.

2066
02:02:47,090 --> 02:02:55,939
Where is he?

2067
02:02:55,939 --> 02:03:10,819
Where even is this guy?

2068
02:03:10,819 --> 02:03:11,899
And why are you talking to me

2069
02:03:11,899 --> 02:03:13,979
like in the middle of a fight like this?

2070
02:03:14,539 --> 02:03:26,800
More food. What is this?

2071
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:27,920
Oh, this is this is not good.

2072
02:03:27,920 --> 02:03:29,920
I have to dodge like everything.

2073
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:53,510
Excuse me?

2074
02:03:53,510 --> 02:03:55,229
And what kind of crack

2075
02:03:55,229 --> 02:04:00,420
is this game smoking right now?

2076
02:04:00,420 --> 02:04:01,220
What?

2077
02:04:06,979 --> 02:04:10,619
I can't hurt him in the middle of that?

2078
02:04:10,619 --> 02:04:13,510
What the fuck was that?

2079
02:04:13,510 --> 02:04:15,310
I almost want to start over.

2080
02:04:15,310 --> 02:04:17,380
Yeah, I'm starting over.

2081
02:04:17,380 --> 02:04:18,140
What are we going to do?

2082
02:04:18,140 --> 02:04:18,699
Yeah, I got it.

2083
02:04:18,699 --> 02:04:19,100
I got it.

2084
02:04:19,100 --> 02:04:19,340
I got it.

2085
02:04:19,340 --> 02:04:19,899
I got it.

2086
02:04:19,899 --> 02:04:26,060
I just want to give him false insecurity.

2087
02:04:26,060 --> 02:04:42,720
I'm going to fucking crush him.

2088
02:04:42,720 --> 02:04:59,460
Land on top of him, please.

2089
02:04:59,460 --> 02:05:00,260
You're out of arrows?

2090
02:05:00,260 --> 02:05:06,630
No, I got arrows.

2091
02:05:07,899 --> 02:05:09,699
I don't know what the fuck that is.

2092
02:05:14,270 --> 02:05:15,270
Shoot?

2093
02:05:16,270 --> 02:05:20,140
All right, I need the, I need the gas thing.

2094
02:05:20,140 --> 02:05:21,539
No, go this way.

2095
02:05:27,229 --> 02:05:28,630
Shoot, what are you doing?

2096
02:05:28,630 --> 02:05:29,989
Why will you not shoot this?

2097
02:05:29,989 --> 02:05:32,229
No, you don't have a bow and arrow.

2098
02:05:33,310 --> 02:05:36,510
What are you talking about?

2099
02:06:05,899 --> 02:06:06,899
He was like,

2100
02:06:06,899 --> 02:06:08,539
Ah, now's my chance.

2101
02:06:08,539 --> 02:06:09,779
Yeah, it is.

2102
02:06:15,569 --> 02:06:18,649
OK, he would have been so funny

2103
02:06:18,649 --> 02:06:21,340
if he died of his health at zero.

2104
02:06:21,340 --> 02:06:22,539
This would be one of the best games

2105
02:06:22,619 --> 02:06:24,260
I've ever played in my entire life.

2106
02:06:24,260 --> 02:06:25,180
That happened.

2107
02:06:43,779 --> 02:06:45,979
We still have an hour and 20 minutes.

2108
02:06:45,979 --> 02:06:47,579
We still have an hour and 20 minutes.

2109
02:06:47,579 --> 02:06:48,979
Everyone, everyone relax.

2110
02:06:48,979 --> 02:06:50,140
Everybody just settle down.

2111
02:06:50,140 --> 02:06:52,439
We've got an hour and 20 minutes,

2112
02:06:52,439 --> 02:06:59,800
at least.

2113
02:06:59,800 --> 02:07:02,220
Can you imagine if I looked over the edge?

2114
02:07:02,220 --> 02:07:03,699
He was just falling.

2115
02:07:03,699 --> 02:07:06,319
I could tell the whole time

2116
02:07:06,319 --> 02:07:07,960
dark souls died on the ground.

2117
02:07:07,960 --> 02:07:15,800
That would have been probably my favorite thing

2118
02:07:15,800 --> 02:07:25,630
I've ever seen in a game.

2119
02:07:25,630 --> 02:07:27,630
Enemies do that in Tears of the Kingdom.

2120
02:07:27,630 --> 02:07:44,819
Nice.

2121
02:07:44,819 --> 02:07:47,250
Will that bring me to two rows?

2122
02:07:47,250 --> 02:07:54,119
Maybe.

2123
02:07:54,119 --> 02:07:56,100
Heart container.

2124
02:07:56,100 --> 02:07:58,439
Oh, that's too bad.

2125
02:08:07,489 --> 02:08:08,489
Yeah, right.

2126
02:08:12,970 --> 02:08:14,689
One row, Andy.

2127
02:08:14,689 --> 02:08:16,250
I know it's bad, but it's not that bad.

2128
02:08:16,250 --> 02:08:17,010
It's fine.

2129
02:08:32,210 --> 02:08:34,689
Yeah, we can't skip the major cutscenes.

2130
02:08:34,689 --> 02:08:37,739
I'm going to see these.

2131
02:08:37,739 --> 02:08:41,640
Oh, look, it's Revelli.

2132
02:08:41,640 --> 02:08:43,350
Revelli.

2133
02:08:43,350 --> 02:08:44,229
Well done.

2134
02:08:44,229 --> 02:08:45,229
Well done, Revelli.

2135
02:08:53,300 --> 02:08:56,750
Don't preen yourself just for doing your job.

2136
02:08:56,750 --> 02:09:00,229
I do suppose you've proven your value as a warrior.

2137
02:09:00,229 --> 02:09:02,949
A warrior worthy of my unique ability.

2138
02:09:02,949 --> 02:09:03,789
And what is it?

2139
02:09:03,789 --> 02:09:24,210
The secret skill that I have dubbed Revelli's Gale.

2140
02:09:24,210 --> 02:09:25,859
Super jump.

2141
02:09:25,859 --> 02:09:27,340
It's now time to move on

2142
02:09:27,340 --> 02:09:31,539
and start making preparations for Meadow Strike on Ganon.

2143
02:09:31,539 --> 02:09:32,380
Good.

2144
02:09:32,380 --> 02:09:33,220
Crazy good.

2145
02:09:33,220 --> 02:09:34,060
Do you still need my help

2146
02:09:34,060 --> 02:09:35,619
while you're fighting inside Hyrule Castle?

2147
02:09:35,619 --> 02:09:36,460
I have them all.

2148
02:09:36,460 --> 02:09:37,300
I have all the powers.

2149
02:09:37,300 --> 02:09:42,949
Feel free to thank me now.

2150
02:09:42,949 --> 02:09:46,739
Or never watch us go.

2151
02:09:46,739 --> 02:09:47,579
You should have done this one way earlier.

2152
02:09:47,579 --> 02:09:50,060
Your job is far from finished, you know.

2153
02:09:50,060 --> 02:10:04,539
The princess has been waiting in awe.

2154
02:10:04,539 --> 02:10:07,399
It's very, very good.

2155
02:10:07,399 --> 02:10:14,869
Most people do this one first.

2156
02:10:14,869 --> 02:10:15,869
Six months.

2157
02:10:20,020 --> 02:10:21,739
He did this one last laughing.

2158
02:10:21,739 --> 02:10:22,579
Why?

2159
02:10:24,060 --> 02:10:25,100
You don't have, there's no order.

2160
02:10:25,100 --> 02:10:28,060
I thought that you guys told me two years ago

2161
02:10:28,060 --> 02:10:30,140
when I started this

2162
02:10:30,140 --> 02:10:32,100
that it didn't matter what order I did.

2163
02:10:47,489 --> 02:10:49,890
I kind of want to make the title of the stream.

2164
02:10:50,970 --> 02:10:53,329
Playing through Breath of the Wild again.

2165
02:10:53,329 --> 02:10:55,689
And then in parentheses, I don't do sequels.

2166
02:11:09,810 --> 02:11:11,770
No, I'm not playing the new one.

2167
02:11:11,770 --> 02:11:13,810
This is the original one.

2168
02:11:13,810 --> 02:11:14,649
I'm playing the new one.

2169
02:11:14,649 --> 02:11:15,489
I don't do sequels.

2170
02:11:15,489 --> 02:11:17,210
I don't watch movie sequels either.

2171
02:11:17,210 --> 02:11:18,770
I have no idea what happens in Star Wars.

2172
02:11:18,770 --> 02:11:22,220
Meadow sights are now set.

2173
02:11:22,220 --> 02:11:24,060
You'll have a precise speed on Ganon

2174
02:11:24,060 --> 02:11:25,819
from this vantage point.

2175
02:11:25,819 --> 02:11:30,720
When the time is right, give him everything you've got.

2176
02:11:30,760 --> 02:11:31,600
What about Diablo II?

2177
02:11:31,600 --> 02:11:33,560
Now we wait for that perfect moment.

2178
02:11:35,939 --> 02:11:40,659
Meadow, we've been artfully patient for the last 100 years.

2179
02:11:40,659 --> 02:11:43,779
I doubt you'll suffer a feather over a few more moments.

2180
02:11:43,779 --> 02:11:44,619
What about TF2?

2181
02:11:51,630 --> 02:11:55,750
After all these years, I simply must admit the truth.

2182
02:11:55,750 --> 02:11:57,869
Even without the power of flight,

2183
02:11:57,869 --> 02:12:00,270
Link made his way to this divine beast

2184
02:12:00,270 --> 02:12:02,829
and accomplished something that even I could not.

2185
02:12:04,329 --> 02:12:06,810
Guess I was wrong about how lucky I was.

2186
02:12:06,850 --> 02:12:08,090
No, they actually changed it.

2187
02:12:08,090 --> 02:12:09,369
Nice.

2188
02:12:09,369 --> 02:12:10,210
I hope that-

2189
02:12:10,210 --> 02:12:12,130
Your favorite movie is Gremlins 2.

2190
02:12:12,130 --> 02:12:20,050
Well, that makes it funnier.

2191
02:12:20,050 --> 02:12:24,539
Armored Core 6.

2192
02:12:24,539 --> 02:12:26,899
That's, there's many sequels in front of that.

2193
02:12:36,220 --> 02:12:37,659
Blustrous power born from the spirit

2194
02:12:37,659 --> 02:12:39,800
of the champion, Revali.

2195
02:12:39,800 --> 02:12:42,840
Creates an upward draft that carries you into the sky.

2196
02:12:42,840 --> 02:12:46,090
Activate by charging jump with B.

2197
02:12:46,090 --> 02:12:49,600
Link.

2198
02:12:49,600 --> 02:12:50,439
Link.

2199
02:12:50,439 --> 02:12:53,289
Is she under the boards?

2200
02:12:53,289 --> 02:12:55,979
Link, thanks to you.

2201
02:12:55,979 --> 02:12:56,819
Oh.

2202
02:12:56,819 --> 02:12:59,939
Both the divine beasts have returned to us

2203
02:12:59,939 --> 02:13:05,159
and the spirits of the champions are free.

2204
02:13:05,159 --> 02:13:08,359
We will all be awaiting your clash with Ganon

2205
02:13:08,359 --> 02:13:10,399
at Hyrule Castle.

2206
02:13:10,399 --> 02:13:11,520
Link, I'm under here.

2207
02:13:16,649 --> 02:13:17,689
Don't ask me how I got in here.

2208
02:13:17,689 --> 02:13:21,500
I was on an adventure and I fell down in here.

2209
02:13:27,039 --> 02:13:28,920
We were doing renovations.

2210
02:13:28,920 --> 02:13:33,010
I got stuck in here.

2211
02:13:33,010 --> 02:13:34,729
In fact, Link, you're standing

2212
02:13:34,729 --> 02:13:38,039
on the only air hole that exists.

2213
02:13:38,039 --> 02:13:41,140
Please move.

2214
02:13:41,180 --> 02:13:46,449
Okay.

2215
02:13:46,449 --> 02:13:47,369
Are we going?

2216
02:13:47,369 --> 02:13:49,840
Is it time to go?

2217
02:13:49,840 --> 02:13:55,380
So now we have to go back here, right?

2218
02:13:55,380 --> 02:13:56,380
That song.

2219
02:13:56,380 --> 02:13:58,590
Do I care about the song?

2220
02:13:58,590 --> 02:14:00,550
Stop being a comedian and just go.

2221
02:14:00,550 --> 02:14:04,090
Eh, yeah, all right, gotcha.

2222
02:14:04,090 --> 02:14:06,850
I have to make, no, now just go.

2223
02:14:06,850 --> 02:14:09,609
No, just go, go, go, go, go.

2224
02:14:09,609 --> 02:14:11,619
Right here?

2225
02:14:11,619 --> 02:14:14,720
You're not even wasting time to be funny.

2226
02:14:14,720 --> 02:14:17,529
Is it?

2227
02:14:17,529 --> 02:14:18,770
No, I see what's going on.

2228
02:14:18,770 --> 02:14:22,619
It's when we, when we added betting to this,

2229
02:14:22,619 --> 02:14:24,659
is when all of you now,

2230
02:14:25,180 --> 02:14:28,539
all of you now do not care about anything else.

2231
02:14:28,539 --> 02:14:30,619
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, just shut the fuck up and go, man.

2232
02:14:30,619 --> 02:14:33,699
I put every channel point I have on you fucking losing

2233
02:14:33,699 --> 02:14:35,579
or winning, go, I don't care.

2234
02:14:40,109 --> 02:14:44,729
I should have done that first.

2235
02:14:44,729 --> 02:14:45,649
Are you serious?

2236
02:14:45,649 --> 02:14:47,050
This is like the power I should have gotten

2237
02:14:47,050 --> 02:14:49,500
in the very beginning of the game.

2238
02:14:49,500 --> 02:14:51,060
And I'm, and I have it an hour before

2239
02:14:51,060 --> 02:15:00,970
I'm never playing it ever again.

2240
02:15:00,970 --> 02:15:02,659
All right, I did it.

2241
02:15:02,659 --> 02:15:03,739
We did it.

2242
02:15:03,739 --> 02:15:05,659
Very cool, very good.

2243
02:15:05,659 --> 02:15:10,279
Life and the divine beast will ravage the calamity now.

2244
02:15:10,279 --> 02:15:11,119
All right.

2245
02:15:14,550 --> 02:15:17,029
Feel free to take what you find in that chest.

2246
02:15:17,029 --> 02:15:17,909
What are you doing?

2247
02:15:17,909 --> 02:15:22,409
I, there's an item in here.

2248
02:15:22,409 --> 02:15:24,170
That sword you have in your possession.

2249
02:15:24,170 --> 02:15:26,810
Would it be the sword that seals the darkness?

2250
02:15:26,810 --> 02:15:28,970
A Hylian champion who fought alongside

2251
02:15:28,970 --> 02:15:31,569
Master Revali a hundred years ago?

2252
02:15:31,569 --> 02:15:34,569
Would that be you?

2253
02:15:34,569 --> 02:15:39,189
It is.

2254
02:15:39,189 --> 02:15:42,539
All right, I got the great eagle bow.

2255
02:15:42,539 --> 02:15:45,220
I got a ton of bombs.

2256
02:15:45,220 --> 02:15:46,909
I'm ready.

2257
02:15:46,909 --> 02:15:49,140
I've got a full heal.

2258
02:15:49,140 --> 02:15:52,119
What, be honest with me for real.

2259
02:15:52,119 --> 02:15:53,920
What is the best possible way to do it?

2260
02:15:53,920 --> 02:15:57,630
Just teleport to here.

2261
02:15:57,630 --> 02:15:58,710
Fast travel right here.

2262
02:15:58,710 --> 02:15:59,829
Go, I'm just gonna go right in the front door.

2263
02:15:59,829 --> 02:16:05,979
I'm just gonna knock on the front door.

2264
02:16:05,979 --> 02:16:09,899
I need food.

2265
02:16:09,899 --> 02:16:11,939
All right, what kind of food am I looking for?

2266
02:16:11,939 --> 02:16:12,819
Is it fire?

2267
02:16:12,819 --> 02:16:13,659
Is it lightning?

2268
02:16:13,659 --> 02:16:15,539
Is it cold?

2269
02:16:15,539 --> 02:16:19,789
What should I be making?

2270
02:16:19,789 --> 02:16:21,109
Food then go, food then go.

2271
02:16:21,109 --> 02:16:21,949
I got it.

2272
02:16:21,949 --> 02:16:24,430
Just make only health, health, health, health, health, health.

2273
02:16:24,430 --> 02:16:26,510
Just heals.

2274
02:16:27,229 --> 02:16:34,139
Link, Link, Link.

2275
02:16:34,139 --> 02:16:36,389
I have witnessed your journey.

2276
02:16:36,389 --> 02:16:40,079
You have overcome every challenge laid before you.

2277
02:16:40,079 --> 02:16:45,639
Ruta, Rudania, Meadow, Naboris.

2278
02:16:47,379 --> 02:16:52,239
All of the divine beasts are now free.

2279
02:16:52,239 --> 02:16:54,559
With the strength you have attained,

2280
02:16:54,559 --> 02:16:57,200
I am certain you can unlock the powerful force

2281
02:16:57,200 --> 02:17:00,850
hidden within.

2282
02:17:00,850 --> 02:17:02,569
Go to the Shrine of Resurrection.

2283
02:17:02,569 --> 02:17:03,409
The Shrine of Resurrection.

2284
02:17:03,409 --> 02:17:05,569
And return the Sheikah Slate to its terminal.

2285
02:17:05,610 --> 02:17:08,840
Okay, I have to do that.

2286
02:17:12,149 --> 02:17:14,219
Why does that say EX?

2287
02:17:14,219 --> 02:17:16,690
That's DLC?

2288
02:17:16,690 --> 02:17:17,930
All right, no, we're not doing DLC.

2289
02:17:17,930 --> 02:17:19,209
I'm going in the front door.

2290
02:17:19,209 --> 02:17:21,020
I need a town though.

2291
02:17:21,020 --> 02:17:24,409
I need to buy shit at a town.

2292
02:17:24,409 --> 02:17:30,020
Where's there a good place to go and get some stuff?

2293
02:17:30,020 --> 02:17:32,540
There's good food where, okay.

2294
02:17:32,540 --> 02:17:36,690
I'm gonna say Zorro?

2295
02:17:36,690 --> 02:17:39,180
Where can I get good food?

2296
02:17:39,180 --> 02:17:40,020
You don't have time?

2297
02:17:40,020 --> 02:17:46,809
I got time for food.

2298
02:17:46,809 --> 02:17:48,209
There's food in the castle.

2299
02:17:48,209 --> 02:17:56,040
Is there actually like a shop or something?

2300
02:17:56,040 --> 02:17:57,760
You hate this game and want it to be over

2301
02:17:57,760 --> 02:17:59,120
as soon as possible.

2302
02:17:59,120 --> 02:18:00,739
That's not true.

2303
02:18:01,260 --> 02:18:03,180
I felt bad that I got this far without beating it.

2304
02:18:03,180 --> 02:18:04,500
And I wanna beat it.

2305
02:18:04,500 --> 02:18:06,899
And I'm very happy with how the game has been so far,

2306
02:18:06,899 --> 02:18:07,739
but I'm ready.

2307
02:18:07,739 --> 02:18:11,379
Let's go.

2308
02:18:11,379 --> 02:18:14,020
Get your Amiibo.

2309
02:18:14,020 --> 02:18:15,500
How much time is left on the timer?

2310
02:18:15,500 --> 02:18:19,149
There is about an hour.

2311
02:18:19,149 --> 02:18:35,200
There's a vendor in the castle.

2312
02:18:35,200 --> 02:18:36,360
Cooking pots in castle.

2313
02:18:36,360 --> 02:18:37,559
So there's no vendor in the castle then.

2314
02:18:37,559 --> 02:18:38,440
So people align.

2315
02:18:43,969 --> 02:18:44,809
Let me just go to,

2316
02:18:44,809 --> 02:18:47,229
I'm gonna go just to here.

2317
02:18:47,229 --> 02:18:48,469
I know, I know.

2318
02:18:48,469 --> 02:18:49,510
Everyone's like, just go, go, go.

2319
02:18:49,510 --> 02:18:52,819
But I wanna buy some stuff.

2320
02:18:52,819 --> 02:18:54,260
I don't trust there's one in the castle.

2321
02:18:54,260 --> 02:19:08,459
I feel like people align.

2322
02:19:08,500 --> 02:19:10,299
If he goes in without food, he'll just die anyways.

2323
02:19:10,299 --> 02:19:11,139
Yeah.

2324
02:19:11,139 --> 02:19:13,889
I wanna give myself a chance.

2325
02:19:13,889 --> 02:19:15,610
We still, there's still over an hour.

2326
02:19:15,610 --> 02:19:18,530
An hour and five minutes to get to the last hit on Ganon.

2327
02:19:18,530 --> 02:19:20,770
That's not happening, but I'll try.

2328
02:19:20,770 --> 02:19:23,659
I'm gonna speed it up.

2329
02:19:23,659 --> 02:19:24,500
Okay.

2330
02:19:24,500 --> 02:19:25,899
So where, I just need a vendor.

2331
02:19:25,899 --> 02:19:27,100
I just need, okay.

2332
02:19:29,090 --> 02:19:30,209
General store, right there.

2333
02:19:30,209 --> 02:19:41,739
Just straight ahead.

2334
02:19:41,739 --> 02:19:43,180
I don't know what that thing is.

2335
02:19:43,180 --> 02:19:50,020
I didn't wanna shoot.

2336
02:19:50,020 --> 02:19:52,399
Okay.

2337
02:19:52,399 --> 02:19:54,000
Do I have enough to upgrade anything?

2338
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:55,479
Because I'm gonna do this quick.

2339
02:19:55,479 --> 02:19:56,440
If I have enough to upgrade,

2340
02:19:56,440 --> 02:19:57,959
what's the best gear that I have right now?

2341
02:19:58,799 --> 02:20:03,379
Probably the, I don't know.

2342
02:20:03,379 --> 02:20:07,409
Honestly, probably the thing I had on before.

2343
02:20:07,409 --> 02:20:17,319
Champion's tunic?

2344
02:20:17,319 --> 02:20:19,360
Probably this, all the soldier shit.

2345
02:20:19,360 --> 02:20:20,819
Okay.

2346
02:20:20,819 --> 02:20:23,059
All right, can I do, can I upgrade any of this?

2347
02:20:30,079 --> 02:20:34,100
Champion's tunic's probably the best.

2348
02:20:34,100 --> 02:20:36,479
Okay, what do we got?

2349
02:20:36,479 --> 02:20:40,639
I can upgrade the champion's tunic.

2350
02:20:40,639 --> 02:20:44,329
Should I?

2351
02:20:44,329 --> 02:20:45,770
That sounds like a good idea.

2352
02:20:50,700 --> 02:20:58,459
That'll be better than what I have on now, right?

2353
02:20:58,459 --> 02:21:02,540
Okay.

2354
02:21:02,540 --> 02:21:10,440
Being able to see health is important.

2355
02:21:13,209 --> 02:21:14,090
Upgrade it again.

2356
02:21:16,469 --> 02:21:17,620
Do I have enough?

2357
02:21:17,620 --> 02:21:25,510
If I can do it twice, I'll do it.

2358
02:21:25,510 --> 02:21:26,510
I don't think I can.

2359
02:21:29,420 --> 02:21:30,620
No, I can't do it again.

2360
02:21:35,780 --> 02:21:36,989
Okay.

2361
02:21:36,989 --> 02:21:39,819
We're going to make food.

2362
02:21:39,819 --> 02:21:41,979
I'm putting that on.

2363
02:21:41,979 --> 02:21:46,739
That's 20 defense, and now I can see enemy health.

2364
02:21:46,739 --> 02:21:47,940
20.

2365
02:21:47,940 --> 02:21:50,620
All right, this is, I've got a good set of gear on.

2366
02:21:50,620 --> 02:21:53,629
I'm good to go.

2367
02:21:53,629 --> 02:21:55,670
Right now, I need to go.

2368
02:21:56,430 --> 02:21:59,430
This is shaving a second off.

2369
02:22:04,389 --> 02:22:05,829
Yeah, I can't just go.

2370
02:22:05,829 --> 02:22:08,270
I'm guaranteed to lose if I just go.

2371
02:22:08,270 --> 02:22:12,969
I need to get at least another two or three big heals.

2372
02:22:12,969 --> 02:22:15,370
It's, you guys are saying, holy, you guys,

2373
02:22:15,370 --> 02:22:17,680
like, go, go, go.

2374
02:22:17,680 --> 02:22:19,600
All of you believers need to understand

2375
02:22:19,600 --> 02:22:23,760
that if I get to Ganon and I die, you'll lose anyways.

2376
02:22:23,760 --> 02:22:26,180
And I think I'm going to die more than once.

2377
02:22:27,260 --> 02:22:28,459
We're going to do it.

2378
02:22:28,459 --> 02:22:29,299
I got time.

2379
02:22:32,020 --> 02:22:33,340
There's like apples and shit right here.

2380
02:22:33,340 --> 02:22:42,770
This is good.

2381
02:22:42,770 --> 02:22:54,600
Okay, where's the general store?

2382
02:22:54,600 --> 02:22:55,600
All right.

2383
02:22:55,600 --> 02:22:57,200
Fire arrows.

2384
02:22:57,200 --> 02:22:58,680
At this point, I should just take them all, right?

2385
02:22:58,680 --> 02:23:06,860
Just take everything?

2386
02:23:06,860 --> 02:23:18,459
Might as well just buy every single thing I can.

2387
02:23:27,790 --> 02:23:31,979
Okay, now what about food?

2388
02:23:31,979 --> 02:23:35,069
Like, real food?

2389
02:23:35,069 --> 02:23:37,110
I'm willing to pay a premium, by the way.

2390
02:23:45,010 --> 02:23:49,319
Different store.

2391
02:23:49,319 --> 02:23:57,899
I don't think I have enough ingredients to cook any food.

2392
02:23:57,899 --> 02:24:00,899
I mean, what do I even have?

2393
02:24:00,899 --> 02:24:03,920
I think I just have to cook everything.

2394
02:24:03,920 --> 02:24:07,090
The store with the carrot on it.

2395
02:24:07,090 --> 02:24:08,549
Wait, this one?

2396
02:24:08,549 --> 02:24:32,170
This has a carrot on it.

2397
02:24:32,170 --> 02:24:37,780
Shitload of carrots here.

2398
02:24:37,780 --> 02:24:38,739
Okay, hell yeah.

2399
02:24:38,739 --> 02:24:39,579
All right, all right, all right.

2400
02:24:39,579 --> 02:24:41,459
We're good.

2401
02:24:41,459 --> 02:24:45,850
Now I'm just going to make a bunch of food.

2402
02:24:45,850 --> 02:24:48,889
Bro is hanging out in Publix with 45 minutes left.

2403
02:24:48,889 --> 02:24:52,049
I need to, I have to make this food, you don't understand.

2404
02:24:52,049 --> 02:24:53,170
All right, what's the best,

2405
02:24:53,170 --> 02:24:54,729
what's the best recipe I can do right now?

2406
02:24:54,729 --> 02:25:01,100
Carrot, carrot, carrot, apple, apple, apple, monster guts.

2407
02:25:01,100 --> 02:25:05,260
Carrot, carrot, carrot.

2408
02:25:05,260 --> 02:25:06,100
How many carrots?

2409
02:25:06,100 --> 02:25:07,860
How many carrots should I put in?

2410
02:25:07,860 --> 02:25:08,700
Who cares?

2411
02:25:08,700 --> 02:25:10,260
It doesn't matter.

2412
02:25:10,260 --> 02:25:12,100
It actually doesn't even matter.

2413
02:25:20,780 --> 02:25:21,620
There we go.

2414
02:25:21,620 --> 02:25:24,139
That's 10 health potions.

2415
02:25:24,139 --> 02:25:25,139
It actually doesn't even matter.

2416
02:25:25,139 --> 02:25:27,989
Who cares?

2417
02:25:27,989 --> 02:25:28,829
I need health.

2418
02:25:28,829 --> 02:25:29,790
I need heals.

2419
02:25:29,790 --> 02:25:32,299
Who cares?

2420
02:25:32,299 --> 02:25:33,340
I bought all these carrots

2421
02:25:33,340 --> 02:25:34,540
and I don't even know where the fuck they are.

2422
02:25:34,540 --> 02:25:35,379
Okay, there.

2423
02:25:44,180 --> 02:25:45,020
Okay, good.

2424
02:25:45,020 --> 02:25:52,739
That's movement speed, all right.

2425
02:25:52,739 --> 02:25:54,129
Okay.

2426
02:25:54,129 --> 02:25:55,690
What else can I use here?

2427
02:25:55,690 --> 02:25:56,930
Let's do carrot.

2428
02:25:56,930 --> 02:25:59,700
Carrot, carrot, carrot, carrot.

2429
02:25:59,739 --> 02:26:02,860
Butter.

2430
02:26:02,860 --> 02:26:05,959
Wait, shit.

2431
02:26:08,889 --> 02:26:11,680
Put away a carrot and put an egg in there.

2432
02:26:11,680 --> 02:26:16,540
Egg, carrot, carrot, carrot, butter.

2433
02:26:16,540 --> 02:26:18,059
That's gonna be fucking great.

2434
02:26:23,549 --> 02:26:24,389
Perfect.

2435
02:26:24,389 --> 02:26:27,680
I'm gonna make that a bunch of times in a row.

2436
02:26:27,680 --> 02:26:31,280
That's carrot, carrot, carrot, butter, egg.

2437
02:26:40,110 --> 02:26:42,389
What was wrong with that?

2438
02:26:42,389 --> 02:26:45,059
What was wrong with that one?

2439
02:26:45,059 --> 02:26:49,930
Egg, butter.

2440
02:26:49,930 --> 02:27:06,670
This one's gonna be really fatty.

2441
02:27:06,670 --> 02:27:07,549
Oh yeah, sure.

2442
02:27:12,819 --> 02:27:13,659
10, good.

2443
02:27:17,010 --> 02:27:20,540
I'm just gonna put a bunch of eggs and salt in this one.

2444
02:27:25,649 --> 02:27:26,489
I'm not wasting it.

2445
02:27:26,489 --> 02:27:27,489
I just need the heals.

2446
02:27:39,909 --> 02:27:46,180
What?

2447
02:27:49,659 --> 02:27:50,500
Use it to make...

2448
02:27:50,500 --> 02:27:51,899
Okay, this is good in stews.

2449
02:27:51,899 --> 02:27:54,450
We're gonna do two of these.

2450
02:27:54,450 --> 02:28:00,819
We're gonna do two of these, a little bit of salt.

2451
02:28:08,549 --> 02:28:10,430
Okay, I have a lot of heals now.

2452
02:28:10,430 --> 02:28:14,670
I think I'm good.

2453
02:28:14,670 --> 02:28:15,829
I need salt and shit too.

2454
02:28:15,829 --> 02:28:19,079
Hold on, salt, salt.

2455
02:28:19,079 --> 02:28:29,079
And who cares?

2456
02:28:29,079 --> 02:28:30,040
Well, that was not worth it.

2457
02:28:30,040 --> 02:28:31,120
All right, I'm good.

2458
02:28:31,120 --> 02:28:32,600
Now it's time to go.

2459
02:28:32,600 --> 02:28:33,479
All right, get the horse.

2460
02:28:33,479 --> 02:28:35,959
We're riding straight into Ganon's castle

2461
02:28:35,959 --> 02:28:39,559
and we're gonna take it back.

2462
02:28:39,559 --> 02:28:42,850
You guys ready?

2463
02:28:42,850 --> 02:28:47,409
What's the fastest way to get there?

2464
02:28:47,409 --> 02:28:59,930
Horse right here.

2465
02:28:59,930 --> 02:29:01,209
Just glide from the tower.

2466
02:29:01,209 --> 02:29:03,010
Ooh, actually smart call.

2467
02:29:03,010 --> 02:29:04,090
I got an hour.

2468
02:29:04,090 --> 02:29:12,659
I have one full hour.

2469
02:29:12,659 --> 02:29:15,700
Run past every enemy, dude.

2470
02:29:15,700 --> 02:29:17,829
Should I?

2471
02:29:17,829 --> 02:29:20,389
I got time, I got time, I got time.

2472
02:29:20,389 --> 02:29:26,899
I might not have very much time, but where's the tower?

2473
02:29:26,899 --> 02:29:27,739
All right, fuck it.

2474
02:29:27,739 --> 02:29:29,700
Yeah, fuck the horse.

2475
02:29:29,700 --> 02:29:30,940
The horse helped us a lot,

2476
02:29:30,940 --> 02:29:47,549
but I'm literally gonna slide from the tower.

2477
02:29:47,549 --> 02:29:49,229
It all comes down to this.

2478
02:29:49,229 --> 02:29:53,159
The end of the Breath of the Wild playthrough.

2479
02:29:53,159 --> 02:29:55,079
Over three years in the making.

2480
02:29:58,219 --> 02:30:03,420
How do I get the quest?

2481
02:30:03,420 --> 02:30:06,000
Destroy Ganon.

2482
02:30:42,290 --> 02:30:44,340
That was not far enough.

2483
02:30:44,340 --> 02:30:47,459
It's okay.

2484
02:30:47,459 --> 02:30:54,170
We're actually not that far.

2485
02:30:54,209 --> 02:31:05,229
There's a shrine over here too.

2486
02:31:05,229 --> 02:31:06,670
Oh, this is gonna be close.

2487
02:31:06,670 --> 02:31:09,510
I was not, you know,

2488
02:31:09,510 --> 02:31:12,719
what about let me see if I can do it in three hours.

2489
02:31:12,719 --> 02:31:17,440
I'm kind of amped up right now.

2490
02:31:17,440 --> 02:31:18,440
You got how to surf?

2491
02:31:19,559 --> 02:31:20,719
Yep.

2492
02:31:20,719 --> 02:31:21,559
I did.

2493
02:31:24,069 --> 02:31:24,909
I did.

2494
02:31:24,909 --> 02:31:25,750
You're right.

2495
02:31:25,750 --> 02:31:41,940
I don't know how.

2496
02:31:41,940 --> 02:31:42,940
ZL jump A.

2497
02:31:47,909 --> 02:31:55,329
I don't know.

2498
02:31:55,329 --> 02:32:02,489
We're good.

2499
02:32:02,489 --> 02:32:04,459
We're good.

2500
02:32:04,459 --> 02:32:05,299
Come on.

2501
02:32:17,670 --> 02:32:19,549
Do I have less than a hundred seconds left in Mario?

2502
02:32:19,549 --> 02:32:20,790
Why does it get faster?

2503
02:32:20,790 --> 02:32:21,629
Oh no.

2504
02:32:37,790 --> 02:32:39,069
Can I block?

2505
02:32:39,069 --> 02:32:40,149
Okay.

2506
02:32:40,149 --> 02:32:44,469
I can probably just kill this thing, honestly.

2507
02:32:44,469 --> 02:32:46,510
Why would you face the, okay.

2508
02:32:46,510 --> 02:32:48,110
I'm locking on.

2509
02:32:48,110 --> 02:32:50,790
He's facing the camera.

2510
02:32:50,790 --> 02:32:53,280
Why are you facing the camera?

2511
02:32:53,280 --> 02:32:56,979
Why did he face the camera?

2512
02:32:56,979 --> 02:33:05,139
Wouldn't lock on turn him around?

2513
02:33:05,139 --> 02:33:15,100
There's another enemy off camera.

2514
02:33:15,100 --> 02:33:17,579
And why did it put me all the way back here?

2515
02:33:22,670 --> 02:33:26,270
What just happened?

2516
02:33:26,270 --> 02:33:27,829
You didn't save it?

2517
02:33:27,829 --> 02:33:28,950
Doesn't it put you?

2518
02:33:28,950 --> 02:33:32,149
Wait, did I not even do the cooking shit?

2519
02:33:32,149 --> 02:33:39,780
You gotta be kidding me.

2520
02:33:39,780 --> 02:33:40,620
Why?

2521
02:33:40,620 --> 02:33:41,979
I feel like I've died a million times

2522
02:33:41,979 --> 02:33:42,819
and it just puts me kind of,

2523
02:33:42,819 --> 02:33:46,590
oh, it's back to the last save point.

2524
02:33:46,590 --> 02:33:49,370
Oh, that's annoying.

2525
02:33:49,370 --> 02:33:50,969
Oh my God.

2526
02:33:50,969 --> 02:33:52,530
Well, that's it.

2527
02:33:52,530 --> 02:33:53,370
It's over.

2528
02:33:53,370 --> 02:34:01,280
Sorry, everybody.

2529
02:34:01,280 --> 02:34:02,680
I didn't even upgrade the armor.

2530
02:34:02,680 --> 02:34:06,180
Are you serious?

2531
02:34:06,180 --> 02:34:07,500
Manual saving?

2532
02:34:07,500 --> 02:34:08,340
Really?

2533
02:34:08,340 --> 02:34:10,100
Are we still to do manual saving

2534
02:34:10,100 --> 02:34:25,059
at the last fucking checkpoint in the game?

2535
02:34:25,100 --> 02:34:26,180
Okay.

2536
02:34:27,260 --> 02:34:28,100
That doesn't count.

2537
02:34:28,100 --> 02:34:29,579
I get an extra 10 minutes.

2538
02:34:29,579 --> 02:34:31,290
No, I don't.

2539
02:34:31,290 --> 02:34:34,559
Now I have to do everything I just did all over again.

2540
02:34:34,559 --> 02:34:36,040
Well, honestly, I much prefer

2541
02:34:36,040 --> 02:34:39,399
like the From Software version of gaming

2542
02:34:39,399 --> 02:34:40,520
where if you,

2543
02:34:40,520 --> 02:34:43,979
dude, if you sneeze, the game auto saves.

2544
02:34:43,979 --> 02:34:45,139
Do you know what I mean?

2545
02:34:47,620 --> 02:34:49,420
Give me manual saves, that's fine.

2546
02:34:49,420 --> 02:34:53,100
But if literally, if I fucking hit up on the control stick,

2547
02:34:53,100 --> 02:34:58,930
auto save the game.

2548
02:34:58,930 --> 02:35:00,370
Okay, well, let me,

2549
02:35:00,370 --> 02:35:05,920
did I even buy anything?

2550
02:35:05,920 --> 02:35:06,760
I don't even remember.

2551
02:35:07,360 --> 02:35:08,680
Did I actually?

2552
02:35:08,680 --> 02:35:09,959
Oh, come on, dude.

2553
02:35:11,459 --> 02:35:19,879
Oh my God.

2554
02:35:19,879 --> 02:35:38,159
I actually have to upgrade this again.

2555
02:35:38,159 --> 02:35:39,559
It was an auto save.

2556
02:35:39,559 --> 02:35:40,399
How come?

2557
02:35:40,399 --> 02:35:43,000
Wait, why would it not put me to the auto save?

2558
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,190
Now I'm getting frustrated.

2559
02:35:45,190 --> 02:35:54,209
Where's the auto save?

2560
02:35:54,209 --> 02:35:56,799
What the hell?

2561
02:35:56,799 --> 02:36:05,280
Wait, how long ago is that?

2562
02:36:05,280 --> 02:36:08,329
Was this even further back?

2563
02:36:08,329 --> 02:36:10,260
Because this is on top of the tower.

2564
02:36:10,260 --> 02:36:12,379
No, this is like 25 minutes ago.

2565
02:36:13,500 --> 02:36:14,700
Isn't it?

2566
02:36:14,700 --> 02:36:15,540
Yeah.

2567
02:36:17,489 --> 02:36:18,329
Oh, come on.

2568
02:36:18,329 --> 02:36:19,170
It was three minutes.

2569
02:36:19,170 --> 02:36:23,270
Actually, that sucks so bad

2570
02:36:23,270 --> 02:36:31,309
that I don't have a save within the last like 15 minutes.

2571
02:36:31,309 --> 02:36:33,370
How often does Zelda auto save?

2572
02:36:33,370 --> 02:36:34,649
Is it more than 15 minutes?

2573
02:36:34,649 --> 02:36:43,930
20 minutes?

2574
02:36:43,930 --> 02:36:50,600
Well, I'm just gonna do what I just did again.

2575
02:36:50,600 --> 02:36:53,610
It's probably when you teleport.

2576
02:36:53,610 --> 02:36:55,250
I have to do all this again.

2577
02:37:10,729 --> 02:37:12,690
The game saves every five minutes.

2578
02:37:12,690 --> 02:37:15,260
No, it doesn't.

2579
02:37:15,260 --> 02:37:17,860
I walked around cooked food for 15 minutes straight.

2580
02:37:25,030 --> 02:37:26,829
Just go right to Ganon?

2581
02:37:26,829 --> 02:37:39,440
Suck it up, cry baby.

2582
02:37:39,440 --> 02:37:40,840
Okay.

2583
02:37:41,920 --> 02:37:43,200
Let me go make the food.

2584
02:37:43,200 --> 02:37:46,309
I don't want to get there and lose.

2585
02:37:46,309 --> 02:37:51,309
So sorry that we got screwed by an auto save teacher.

2586
02:37:52,899 --> 02:37:53,780
Sorry, guys.

2587
02:37:58,120 --> 02:38:00,159
That's my fault for not manually saving

2588
02:38:00,159 --> 02:38:04,819
before every single encounter that's important.

2589
02:38:04,819 --> 02:38:11,469
Oh, well.

2590
02:38:12,270 --> 02:38:13,110
You could just try killing Ganon right...

2591
02:38:13,110 --> 02:38:15,430
I guess I could just go try to kill Ganon right now.

2592
02:38:15,430 --> 02:38:17,430
Just run through the dungeon.

2593
02:38:17,430 --> 02:38:18,670
That's possible, right?

2594
02:38:23,920 --> 02:38:24,760
I don't think I...

2595
02:38:24,760 --> 02:38:25,600
No, no.

2596
02:38:26,879 --> 02:38:31,090
I could try it.

2597
02:38:31,090 --> 02:38:32,329
All right, here's the plan.

2598
02:38:32,329 --> 02:38:33,170
Here's the plan.

2599
02:38:33,170 --> 02:38:34,209
His plan is plan.

2600
02:38:34,209 --> 02:38:42,120
I'm going as fast as I can.

2601
02:38:55,420 --> 02:38:56,340
Did I at least buy?

2602
02:38:56,340 --> 02:38:59,069
No, I'm all right, I'm all right.

2603
02:38:59,069 --> 02:39:00,670
I don't think I was ever gonna do it anyways,

2604
02:39:00,670 --> 02:39:02,510
but it was worth a shot.

2605
02:39:02,510 --> 02:39:03,790
I'm still gonna beat it,

2606
02:39:03,790 --> 02:39:05,549
even if I don't do it in the timer.

2607
02:39:05,549 --> 02:39:06,549
I'm still gonna do it.

2608
02:39:06,549 --> 02:39:09,909
The joke of me turning off the game is not gonna happen.

2609
02:39:09,909 --> 02:39:17,989
I will complete it.

2610
02:39:17,989 --> 02:39:21,469
You're just gonna lose a lot of channel points.

2611
02:39:21,469 --> 02:39:23,590
Whoever bet for me to win.

2612
02:39:32,739 --> 02:39:40,649
All right, let's make the food again.

2613
02:39:40,649 --> 02:39:41,969
The recipes.

2614
02:39:45,219 --> 02:39:47,450
Okay.

2615
02:39:47,450 --> 02:39:48,930
Now I gotta remember what the hell I even did.

2616
02:39:48,930 --> 02:39:49,930
It was bat.

2617
02:39:54,379 --> 02:39:58,360
Okay, it was butter, salt, and...

2618
02:39:58,360 --> 02:40:02,709
Butter, salt, eggs, and carrots.

2619
02:40:02,709 --> 02:40:09,110
It's a double carrot.

2620
02:40:14,739 --> 02:40:17,040
Okay.

2621
02:40:17,719 --> 02:40:24,030
Butter, salt, egg, double carrot.

2622
02:40:24,030 --> 02:40:29,239
Where are my carrots?

2623
02:40:29,239 --> 02:40:30,079
Where are...

2624
02:40:30,079 --> 02:40:32,000
Oh my God, these carrots are so weird.

2625
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:33,840
They blend in with everything.

2626
02:40:33,840 --> 02:40:44,610
No, don't eat one.

2627
02:40:44,610 --> 02:40:45,450
Stop cooking.

2628
02:40:45,450 --> 02:40:47,299
I'll die.

2629
02:40:47,299 --> 02:40:49,700
You think I'm gonna be able to kill Calamity Ganon

2630
02:40:49,700 --> 02:40:51,059
with no heals?

2631
02:40:51,059 --> 02:41:03,620
It's never gonna happen.

2632
02:41:03,620 --> 02:41:19,739
Okay, good.

2633
02:41:19,739 --> 02:41:22,040
Why was that so bad?

2634
02:41:22,040 --> 02:41:23,959
All right, only, I'm gonna do one more.

2635
02:41:23,959 --> 02:41:29,420
I should have enough after this.

2636
02:41:29,420 --> 02:41:33,159
Wait, don't I have something that gives a lot of hearts?

2637
02:41:33,159 --> 02:41:34,079
This one right here.

2638
02:41:34,079 --> 02:41:46,569
I'm gonna just cook that with salt.

2639
02:41:46,569 --> 02:41:47,969
So it's just a bunch of hearts?

2640
02:41:47,969 --> 02:41:51,379
Or should I just do it alone?

2641
02:41:51,379 --> 02:41:52,459
Should I just do it by itself?

2642
02:41:52,459 --> 02:41:54,059
It temporarily increases your maximum hearts

2643
02:41:54,059 --> 02:41:54,899
when cooked into a dish.

2644
02:41:54,899 --> 02:41:56,629
Or should I add stuff to it?

2645
02:41:56,629 --> 02:42:04,100
Add a melon, just salt.

2646
02:42:04,100 --> 02:42:05,549
Cook it alone?

2647
02:42:05,549 --> 02:42:07,030
Just cook alone, by itself?

2648
02:42:07,030 --> 02:42:12,979
Okay.

2649
02:42:12,979 --> 02:42:13,819
Holy shit.

2650
02:42:13,819 --> 02:42:15,180
Okay.

2651
02:42:15,180 --> 02:42:16,340
I still have time.

2652
02:42:16,340 --> 02:42:17,180
There's still time.

2653
02:42:17,180 --> 02:42:18,020
I got time, I got time, everybody.

2654
02:42:18,020 --> 02:42:19,020
That was awesome.

2655
02:42:19,020 --> 02:42:20,829
Holy shit.

2656
02:42:20,829 --> 02:42:22,870
I got time, I got time, I got time, I got time.

2657
02:42:22,870 --> 02:42:23,989
Go to the waterfall?

2658
02:42:25,270 --> 02:42:27,750
Put on your Zora armor and swim up to the final battle?

2659
02:42:27,750 --> 02:42:32,739
Wait, is that real?

2660
02:42:32,739 --> 02:42:42,059
Are you giving me like the speed run strategy?

2661
02:42:42,059 --> 02:42:42,899
All right.

2662
02:42:42,899 --> 02:42:43,739
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

2663
02:42:43,739 --> 02:42:46,680
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go.

2664
02:42:46,680 --> 02:42:51,180
Any more goat butter or whatever it is?

2665
02:42:51,180 --> 02:43:02,440
I don't know what any of this shit does, who cares?

2666
02:43:02,440 --> 02:43:03,399
We're back, we're back.

2667
02:43:03,399 --> 02:43:04,600
Yeah, we're back, we're actually back.

2668
02:43:04,600 --> 02:43:05,440
All right.

2669
02:43:05,440 --> 02:43:11,840
Now, where's this?

2670
02:43:11,840 --> 02:43:14,440
Go to the waterfall in the southwest of the island

2671
02:43:14,440 --> 02:43:19,840
that Hyrule Castle is on.

2672
02:43:19,840 --> 02:43:25,100
Go to the waterfall in the southwest island.

2673
02:43:25,100 --> 02:43:28,510
This is cheating.

2674
02:43:28,510 --> 02:43:34,139
I saved it.

2675
02:43:34,139 --> 02:43:38,020
He is never gonna find that.

2676
02:43:38,020 --> 02:43:41,389
What, we got 35 minutes?

2677
02:43:42,270 --> 02:43:44,930
Please give us the underdog moment we've been waiting for.

2678
02:43:44,930 --> 02:43:46,430
Okay.

2679
02:43:46,430 --> 02:43:48,590
Waterfall in the southwest of the island

2680
02:43:48,590 --> 02:43:49,750
that Hyrule Castle is on.

2681
02:43:49,750 --> 02:43:51,750
Put on your Zora armor and swim up the waterfall.

2682
02:43:51,750 --> 02:43:53,670
Keep going up each waterfall that you reach.

2683
02:43:53,670 --> 02:43:55,389
It should be very close.

2684
02:43:55,389 --> 02:44:01,110
Pass a few guardians, okay?

2685
02:44:01,110 --> 02:44:07,250
So from here, from Hyrule Castle, southwest of the island.

2686
02:44:08,049 --> 02:44:11,659
So down here somewhere, like over here?

2687
02:44:11,659 --> 02:44:25,180
I'm gonna say like right here somewhere.

2688
02:44:25,180 --> 02:44:27,500
Should I get the horse, honestly?

2689
02:44:27,500 --> 02:44:30,899
The island the castle is on.

2690
02:44:31,020 --> 02:44:34,020
So you mean like here somewhere.

2691
02:44:34,020 --> 02:44:39,500
I gotta even get there first.

2692
02:44:39,500 --> 02:44:40,940
What's the safe way to even get over here?

2693
02:44:40,940 --> 02:44:42,940
I feel like there's a ton of those laser shooting guardians

2694
02:44:42,940 --> 02:44:45,700
that just fire machine guns at you.

2695
02:44:47,479 --> 02:44:48,680
My armor is different.

2696
02:44:48,680 --> 02:44:52,010
Right.

2697
02:44:52,010 --> 02:44:52,850
Zora armor.

2698
02:44:56,239 --> 02:45:01,750
That's it, all right.

2699
02:45:01,750 --> 02:45:02,590
Save it here.

2700
02:45:02,590 --> 02:45:04,780
I just saved it a second ago.

2701
02:45:04,780 --> 02:45:06,219
Go to the central tower.

2702
02:45:12,299 --> 02:45:13,700
I don't know what hell I'm going.

2703
02:45:13,700 --> 02:45:16,540
I guess I've never, I've never even seen this before.

2704
02:45:16,540 --> 02:45:20,770
I don't know where to go.

2705
02:45:20,770 --> 02:45:21,850
I guess, I mean, I'm,

2706
02:45:22,370 --> 02:45:23,409
I think I can get there from here.

2707
02:45:23,409 --> 02:45:24,969
There's no bullshit in the way.

2708
02:45:30,219 --> 02:45:32,059
I just gotta remember how you do the,

2709
02:45:36,120 --> 02:45:42,200
it's right here.

2710
02:45:42,200 --> 02:45:44,399
ZL jump and then A.

2711
02:45:55,819 --> 02:45:57,620
This thing's gonna fucking shatter.

2712
02:46:04,229 --> 02:46:18,770
All right, Tilda, I'm coming to save you.

2713
02:46:18,770 --> 02:46:25,500
How bad, how bad is this current?

2714
02:46:25,500 --> 02:46:31,180
Fuck.

2715
02:46:31,180 --> 02:46:34,780
What the fuck is that thing?

2716
02:46:34,780 --> 02:46:40,989
Yeah.

2717
02:46:40,989 --> 02:46:42,110
Okay, all right.

2718
02:46:42,110 --> 02:46:43,190
We're getting there, we're getting there.

2719
02:46:43,190 --> 02:46:44,750
Don't aggro that thing.

2720
02:46:47,350 --> 02:46:55,149
Oops.

2721
02:46:55,149 --> 02:46:56,350
Bro, I'm gonna start screaming.

2722
02:46:56,350 --> 02:46:59,389
Everybody fucking settle down, okay?

2723
02:46:59,389 --> 02:47:00,309
Settle down.

2724
02:47:00,309 --> 02:47:01,950
Everything is gonna be just fine.

2725
02:47:08,069 --> 02:47:15,520
Can't get in here.

2726
02:47:15,520 --> 02:47:17,000
I can't swim again.

2727
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:36,659
Don't I have the swimming outfit on?

2728
02:47:36,659 --> 02:47:43,950
We're good.

2729
02:47:43,950 --> 02:47:50,020
Hey, if I could get this thing away from me, seriously.

2730
02:47:50,020 --> 02:47:51,180
You know what?

2731
02:47:51,180 --> 02:47:52,659
Just fucking die.

2732
02:48:00,909 --> 02:48:01,829
How do you parry?

2733
02:48:08,540 --> 02:48:09,379
How do you parry?

2734
02:48:09,379 --> 02:48:11,200
What is parry?

2735
02:48:12,159 --> 02:48:14,329
It's A.

2736
02:48:14,329 --> 02:48:21,680
I would run by, but the thing just,

2737
02:48:21,680 --> 02:48:28,280
it's shield plus A.

2738
02:48:28,280 --> 02:48:31,780
Okay, well, I'm just gonna try to run away

2739
02:48:31,780 --> 02:48:33,979
from the lock-on enemy that locks on you

2740
02:48:33,979 --> 02:48:36,379
from across the entire video game.

2741
02:48:36,379 --> 02:48:38,340
Whoa!

2742
02:48:38,340 --> 02:48:39,340
Hold on.

2743
02:48:39,340 --> 02:48:40,940
Don't get angry at the enemy that you hate

2744
02:48:40,940 --> 02:48:43,500
more than anything in any video game you've ever played.

2745
02:48:45,299 --> 02:48:46,139
How does that sound?

2746
02:48:46,139 --> 02:48:48,090
You fucking idiot.

2747
02:48:48,090 --> 02:49:01,030
Nice shot, stupid.

2748
02:49:01,030 --> 02:49:14,370
No, no, great, great enemy.

2749
02:49:14,370 --> 02:49:15,530
I'm gonna get in there again

2750
02:49:16,209 --> 02:49:17,250
and I'm gonna kill you.

2751
02:49:30,350 --> 02:49:33,799
What happened?

2752
02:49:33,799 --> 02:49:41,600
Did I do it?

2753
02:49:41,600 --> 02:49:44,010
Skip the cutscene?

2754
02:49:44,010 --> 02:49:53,170
I can't skip the cutscene.

2755
02:49:53,170 --> 02:50:14,969
I wanna see what Ganon looks like.

2756
02:50:14,969 --> 02:50:18,829
Oh my God.

2757
02:50:18,829 --> 02:50:20,549
This is a whole fortress, guys.

2758
02:50:22,110 --> 02:50:23,149
What is aiming at me?

2759
02:50:29,219 --> 02:50:31,569
Okay, waterfall.

2760
02:50:31,569 --> 02:50:32,569
I gotta go this way.

2761
02:50:57,559 --> 02:50:59,319
Okay.

2762
02:50:59,319 --> 02:51:00,920
I wanna see the, no, I wanna see the map.

2763
02:51:00,920 --> 02:51:03,079
The other map.

2764
02:51:03,079 --> 02:51:04,969
How do I see the other map?

2765
02:51:05,010 --> 02:51:05,850
You missed it?

2766
02:51:05,850 --> 02:51:07,090
Wait, is it this one right here?

2767
02:51:07,090 --> 02:51:10,020
Right there?

2768
02:51:10,020 --> 02:51:12,739
That's the waterfall right there?

2769
02:51:12,739 --> 02:51:17,540
That's it?

2770
02:51:17,540 --> 02:51:18,780
No, not that one.

2771
02:51:18,780 --> 02:51:20,100
Oh, fuck.

2772
02:51:20,100 --> 02:51:24,590
Mods, help!

2773
02:51:24,590 --> 02:51:25,430
I don't know.

2774
02:51:25,430 --> 02:51:26,270
I don't know.

2775
02:51:26,270 --> 02:51:39,069
I'm gonna try that one.

2776
02:51:39,069 --> 02:51:41,010
That's not even a,

2777
02:51:41,010 --> 02:51:47,489
that's not a real waterfall.

2778
02:51:47,489 --> 02:51:49,129
You can't swim up that one.

2779
02:51:49,129 --> 02:51:55,840
Shit.

2780
02:51:55,840 --> 02:51:57,319
The bridge into the castle is south,

2781
02:51:57,319 --> 02:51:59,040
but I'm gonna try this water strategy.

2782
02:51:59,040 --> 02:52:02,489
I kinda like that.

2783
02:52:02,489 --> 02:52:04,530
Dude, that was a mist, not a waterfall.

2784
02:52:04,530 --> 02:52:05,370
Shit.

2785
02:52:05,370 --> 02:52:06,649
What's the?

2786
02:52:06,649 --> 02:52:13,870
Okay, so if I go this way,

2787
02:52:14,670 --> 02:52:18,649
there's a waterfall out here somewhere.

2788
02:52:18,649 --> 02:52:21,469
So like down to the left here, you mean.

2789
02:52:21,469 --> 02:52:22,510
Let me take a look.

2790
02:52:22,510 --> 02:52:25,069
There's a lot of bullshit over here.

2791
02:52:25,069 --> 02:52:44,579
I'm looking for a waterfall.

2792
02:52:44,579 --> 02:52:45,540
God damn it.

2793
02:52:45,540 --> 02:52:46,540
I don't, I don't know where,

2794
02:52:46,540 --> 02:52:47,780
I don't know where it is.

2795
02:52:49,340 --> 02:52:50,540
Oh my goodness.

2796
02:52:50,540 --> 02:52:51,420
That's a lot of shit.

2797
02:52:51,420 --> 02:52:52,260
A, right?

2798
02:52:52,260 --> 02:52:53,909
A?

2799
02:52:54,750 --> 02:52:55,590
Okay, got it, got it, got it.

2800
02:52:55,590 --> 02:52:56,829
I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it.

2801
02:52:56,829 --> 02:52:58,690
I got it.

2802
02:52:58,690 --> 02:52:59,889
Where?

2803
02:52:59,889 --> 02:53:04,629
What happened?

2804
02:53:04,629 --> 02:53:06,069
Okay, let me eat something.

2805
02:53:06,069 --> 02:53:12,510
I don't wanna eat everything now already.

2806
02:53:15,540 --> 02:53:17,899
This is it right here.

2807
02:53:17,899 --> 02:53:20,260
Give me up this waterfall so I can win this.

2808
02:53:20,260 --> 02:53:31,959
I was a stupid challenge.

2809
02:53:31,959 --> 02:53:32,799
Come on.

2810
02:53:35,579 --> 02:53:36,899
All right, now what?

2811
02:53:36,899 --> 02:53:38,100
Now what do I do?

2812
02:53:38,100 --> 02:53:38,940
What was the?

2813
02:53:38,940 --> 02:53:40,299
Where's my instructions?

2814
02:53:40,299 --> 02:53:45,530
Where's my instructions?

2815
02:53:45,530 --> 02:53:48,200
Just go on this one?

2816
02:53:48,200 --> 02:53:49,479
More waterfalls, all the waterfalls.

2817
02:53:49,479 --> 02:53:50,319
Do all waterfalls now.

2818
02:53:50,319 --> 02:53:51,520
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

2819
02:53:51,520 --> 02:53:52,399
Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it.

2820
02:53:52,399 --> 02:53:55,299
Let's go.

2821
02:53:55,299 --> 02:53:59,840
Full stamina.

2822
02:53:59,840 --> 02:54:01,200
That was very ugly.

2823
02:54:01,200 --> 02:54:07,870
That was ugly.

2824
02:54:07,870 --> 02:54:17,540
Waterfall three.

2825
02:54:17,540 --> 02:54:18,379
What's that?

2826
02:54:18,379 --> 02:54:21,379
Hey, hey, hey, hey, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2827
02:54:21,379 --> 02:54:29,500
What do I do?

2828
02:54:29,500 --> 02:54:32,579
Just run in?

2829
02:54:32,579 --> 02:54:34,500
Just run, run in, run inside.

2830
02:54:35,819 --> 02:54:37,659
Oh my God, this really is right here.

2831
02:54:41,860 --> 02:54:52,280
No, no.

2832
02:54:52,280 --> 02:54:53,440
I'm right there, dude.

2833
02:54:53,440 --> 02:54:54,600
It's still possible.

2834
02:54:54,600 --> 02:54:57,979
We got, I got 20 minutes to beat this.

2835
02:54:57,979 --> 02:54:59,979
I didn't believe and neither did anybody else,

2836
02:54:59,979 --> 02:55:05,069
but I think I do believe now.

2837
02:55:05,069 --> 02:55:06,229
Where did this put me?

2838
02:55:07,149 --> 02:55:14,139
What did you just do?

2839
02:55:14,139 --> 02:55:17,940
Excuse me, what just happened?

2840
02:55:17,940 --> 02:55:20,459
What's going on here?

2841
02:55:20,459 --> 02:55:22,020
Waterfall again?

2842
02:55:22,020 --> 02:55:23,659
What's going on?

2843
02:55:23,659 --> 02:55:25,420
I don't remember this.

2844
02:55:25,420 --> 02:55:30,610
This is not where I just was.

2845
02:55:30,610 --> 02:55:31,729
Oh, yep, I remember.

2846
02:55:31,729 --> 02:55:41,579
Okay, I got it.

2847
02:55:41,579 --> 02:55:44,139
Okay, come on, here we go.

2848
02:55:44,139 --> 02:55:46,139
That's this, I got an idea.

2849
02:55:46,139 --> 02:55:52,389
I haven't been spotted yet.

2850
02:55:52,389 --> 02:55:55,159
That's fine, that's fine, fuck you.

2851
02:55:55,159 --> 02:55:56,239
Give a shit.

2852
02:55:56,239 --> 02:56:06,659
You can't give a shit.

2853
02:56:06,659 --> 02:56:10,659
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2854
02:56:10,659 --> 02:56:12,979
You can't be fucking serious.

2855
02:56:47,239 --> 02:56:48,719
Sad boy, suck it up.

2856
02:56:48,719 --> 02:56:52,059
I got it, I got it, I got it, I'm fine.

2857
02:56:52,059 --> 02:56:53,420
You know what?

2858
02:56:53,420 --> 02:56:55,299
I'm just gonna be a weirdo.

2859
02:57:08,680 --> 02:57:12,549
Wrong, I just pressed every single button on my controller.

2860
02:57:12,549 --> 02:57:13,709
All right, come on, Ganon, let's go.

2861
02:57:13,709 --> 02:57:16,129
What, I got 10 minutes?

2862
02:57:16,129 --> 02:57:23,219
Save it right here.

2863
02:57:23,219 --> 02:57:24,379
The Sanctum.

2864
02:57:24,379 --> 02:57:26,930
Did I actually just make it?

2865
02:57:26,930 --> 02:57:27,930
Oh, I'm killing him right now.

2866
02:57:27,930 --> 02:57:36,090
Let's go, I got 17 minutes to beat the game.

2867
02:57:36,090 --> 02:57:37,090
All right, I got bomb arrows.

2868
02:57:37,090 --> 02:57:38,209
It's a shitload of bomb arrows.

2869
02:57:38,209 --> 02:57:39,049
It's a bunch of heals.

2870
02:57:40,010 --> 02:57:46,079
Power-ups.

2871
02:57:50,139 --> 02:57:51,180
I have to change my armor too.

2872
02:57:51,180 --> 02:57:52,020
That's a good idea.

2873
02:57:52,020 --> 02:57:52,860
Good call.

2874
02:57:59,469 --> 02:58:02,950
Whoa, whoa, ow, loud.

2875
02:58:02,950 --> 02:58:03,790
Where did that come from?

2876
02:58:03,790 --> 02:58:10,290
This got so fucking loud.

2877
02:58:10,290 --> 02:58:12,090
That was loud as hell.

2878
02:58:12,090 --> 02:58:18,020
Jesus.

2879
02:58:18,020 --> 02:58:19,940
Dude, it's been this loud?

2880
02:58:19,940 --> 02:58:27,590
Has it really?

2881
02:58:27,590 --> 02:58:30,059
What?

2882
02:58:30,059 --> 02:58:31,500
I didn't realize it was that loud.

2883
02:58:31,500 --> 02:58:36,469
I turned it down.

2884
02:58:36,469 --> 02:58:38,629
It's been fine.

2885
02:58:38,629 --> 02:58:44,409
All right, here we go.

2886
02:58:44,450 --> 02:58:52,819
All right, so there's a giant spider.

2887
02:58:52,819 --> 02:58:55,719
Okay, there you are.

2888
02:58:55,719 --> 02:58:59,059
All right, bomb arrows right in the face.

2889
02:58:59,059 --> 02:59:06,590
Calamity Ganon, I'm ready.

2890
02:59:06,590 --> 02:59:07,709
Here we go, bomb arrows.

2891
02:59:07,709 --> 02:59:14,940
Gonna shoot 100 bomb arrows in his face at the same time.

2892
02:59:14,940 --> 02:59:16,139
No, it's my moment.

2893
02:59:20,309 --> 02:59:22,709
Each one of these is gonna take his health down by 25%.

2894
02:59:22,709 --> 02:59:35,020
If that's really what happens, I hope so.

2895
02:59:35,020 --> 02:59:40,149
Do it, get him.

2896
02:59:40,149 --> 02:59:41,510
Yes, one more.

2897
02:59:51,579 --> 02:59:52,979
All right, let's do it.

2898
02:59:52,979 --> 02:59:54,860
I'm just gonna shoot every bomb arrow I have.

2899
02:59:54,860 --> 02:59:57,340
I don't even wanna see what he has for moves.

2900
02:59:57,340 --> 03:00:11,569
I don't even care.

2901
03:00:11,569 --> 03:00:13,649
It actually is doing that.

2902
03:00:13,649 --> 03:00:15,719
Wow.

2903
03:00:15,719 --> 03:00:21,860
That's a pretty good, okay, it's 50%.

2904
03:00:21,860 --> 03:00:27,680
That was a great cleric beast.

2905
03:00:27,680 --> 03:00:30,120
How many bomb arrows do I have, like 40?

2906
03:00:30,120 --> 03:00:37,959
Okay, let's do it.

2907
03:00:37,959 --> 03:00:45,540
Save the game?

2908
03:00:45,540 --> 03:00:49,370
Can't.

2909
03:00:49,370 --> 03:00:53,079
Okay, I'm already dead.

2910
03:00:53,079 --> 03:00:56,149
Shoot.

2911
03:00:56,149 --> 03:00:57,549
Oh my God.

2912
03:00:57,549 --> 03:00:59,270
Okay, what do I have?

2913
03:00:59,270 --> 03:01:07,030
I have Heal somewhere.

2914
03:01:07,030 --> 03:01:09,389
Okay, I need this other armor on.

2915
03:01:09,389 --> 03:01:11,870
Where is it, right here?

2916
03:01:11,870 --> 03:01:17,180
Okay, and I also want these,

2917
03:01:17,219 --> 03:01:19,020
and that's fine, let's go.

2918
03:01:21,229 --> 03:01:23,530
What does that sound, Ganon?

2919
03:01:23,530 --> 03:01:26,479
I've got something for you.

2920
03:01:26,479 --> 03:01:55,889
And it's 24 bomb arrows right into your head.

2921
03:01:55,889 --> 03:01:57,790
How do you put on a new bow?

2922
03:01:57,790 --> 03:01:59,430
How do I put a new bow on?

2923
03:02:08,770 --> 03:02:10,729
What is, I don't wanna, what the fuck was that?

2924
03:02:10,729 --> 03:02:12,530
I'm doing, I'm holding right on the D-pad

2925
03:02:12,530 --> 03:02:14,059
and it was holding up.

2926
03:02:14,059 --> 03:02:27,959
This pro controller is a fucking piece of crap.

2927
03:02:27,959 --> 03:02:30,120
What the fuck are you doing?

2928
03:02:30,120 --> 03:02:32,389
What is happening?

2929
03:02:32,389 --> 03:02:42,889
Hold, this controller is actually fucking broken.

2930
03:02:42,889 --> 03:02:45,450
I forgot, Breath of the Wild has 80 inputs.

2931
03:02:45,450 --> 03:02:47,170
I forgot it has 800 inputs.

2932
03:02:55,700 --> 03:02:56,659
Hairs in my face.

2933
03:03:30,360 --> 03:03:50,860
I'm just gonna eat everything I have.

2934
03:03:50,860 --> 03:03:55,850
Now what?

2935
03:03:55,850 --> 03:04:02,180
Oh God.

2936
03:04:02,180 --> 03:04:03,100
All right, I can't hurt them,

2937
03:04:03,100 --> 03:04:04,899
I can't hurt them with that anymore.

2938
03:04:04,899 --> 03:04:07,979
Why do I not have a shield on?

2939
03:04:07,979 --> 03:04:09,059
What's the best shield in the whole game?

2940
03:04:09,059 --> 03:04:10,299
What's the best shield in the game?

2941
03:04:10,299 --> 03:04:19,700
This right here.

2942
03:04:19,700 --> 03:04:21,459
Why am I, why is the shield not,

2943
03:04:21,459 --> 03:04:23,420
guys, why is the shield not out?

2944
03:04:24,829 --> 03:04:32,780
What is happening in this game?

2945
03:04:32,780 --> 03:05:00,569
Go, go in.

2946
03:05:00,569 --> 03:05:01,409
Can I hurt that?

2947
03:05:01,409 --> 03:05:05,750
No.

2948
03:05:05,750 --> 03:05:10,549
Dude, I can't even, why am I crouching?

2949
03:05:12,010 --> 03:05:25,430
This game, I swear to God.

2950
03:05:25,430 --> 03:05:27,069
How do I, how do you stop crouching?

2951
03:05:27,069 --> 03:05:29,909
What is, why is there a crouch in the game?

2952
03:05:29,909 --> 03:05:44,139
I don't think, I've never pressed the crouch button.

2953
03:05:44,139 --> 03:05:51,920
How do I, how do I stop him from, how do I get him down?

2954
03:05:51,920 --> 03:06:01,500
Oh shit, I can't hurt him.

2955
03:06:01,500 --> 03:06:02,340
Okay, parry.

2956
03:06:04,260 --> 03:06:06,620
That didn't parry, what?

2957
03:06:06,620 --> 03:06:07,459
Why?

2958
03:06:07,739 --> 03:06:25,819
That looked perfect.

2959
03:06:25,819 --> 03:06:31,329
I don't know how to hurt him now.

2960
03:06:31,329 --> 03:06:38,750
I don't know how to hurt him.

2961
03:06:38,750 --> 03:06:41,870
He's made out of, like, he's made out of solidified shit.

2962
03:06:41,870 --> 03:06:50,180
I can't hurt him.

2963
03:06:50,180 --> 03:06:53,479
You have to parry.

2964
03:06:53,479 --> 03:06:54,719
Oh, I'm skipping this cutscene.

2965
03:06:54,719 --> 03:06:57,340
I got it.

2966
03:06:57,340 --> 03:07:12,350
I got it, I got it, I got time, I got time.

2967
03:07:12,350 --> 03:07:14,579
We got it.

2968
03:07:14,579 --> 03:07:17,709
Use that blue shield, it'll auto parry for you.

2969
03:07:17,709 --> 03:07:20,409
That's good to know.

2970
03:07:20,409 --> 03:07:21,649
I have all the bombs back,

2971
03:07:21,649 --> 03:07:30,360
but I have to put all my gear back on, don't I?

2972
03:07:30,360 --> 03:07:33,500
This will parry automatically, you mean?

2973
03:07:33,500 --> 03:07:35,409
I don't believe it.

2974
03:07:35,409 --> 03:07:37,329
Okay, hold on, let me get all my shit on here.

2975
03:07:37,329 --> 03:07:40,940
That and my bomb arrows.

2976
03:07:52,069 --> 03:07:53,420
Got it.

2977
03:07:53,420 --> 03:07:54,260
I don't even know if I got it.

2978
03:07:54,260 --> 03:07:55,100
What, did I?

2979
03:07:55,100 --> 03:08:06,059
It's hard to tell.

2980
03:08:06,059 --> 03:08:09,489
Is that still early?

2981
03:08:09,489 --> 03:08:23,500
I don't know how you fucking parry in this game.

2982
03:08:23,500 --> 03:08:36,159
All right, do it again.

2983
03:08:36,159 --> 03:09:01,459
Oh, let's go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

2984
03:09:01,459 --> 03:09:02,829
Did I not get it?

2985
03:09:02,829 --> 03:09:13,020
Oh my God, my shield is broken.

2986
03:09:13,020 --> 03:09:33,450
Dude, you're breaking all, why is, ugh!

2987
03:09:33,450 --> 03:09:39,540
The parry, I feel like I don't, I don't get it.

2988
03:09:39,540 --> 03:09:41,579
You know what sucks too, is when you have the bow out,

2989
03:09:41,579 --> 03:09:46,649
and I got it right here, buddy.

2990
03:09:46,649 --> 03:09:51,750
Is that not hitting?

2991
03:09:52,930 --> 03:10:06,639
Yeah, shut up, game.

2992
03:10:06,639 --> 03:10:08,739
Do it again.

2993
03:10:08,739 --> 03:10:10,280
Come on, Gwen.

2994
03:10:10,280 --> 03:10:24,079
Come on, Gwen.

2995
03:10:24,079 --> 03:10:44,069
Oh, those don't, you can't parry those.

2996
03:10:44,069 --> 03:10:49,940
All right, come on, do it.

2997
03:10:49,940 --> 03:11:00,600
Fuck!

2998
03:11:00,600 --> 03:11:05,860
I did it, but it didn't reflect all the way.

2999
03:11:05,860 --> 03:11:12,430
My God, it's so hard, why?

3000
03:11:12,430 --> 03:11:14,190
I don't have a shield on?

3001
03:11:14,190 --> 03:11:23,700
Why is this game like this?

3002
03:11:23,700 --> 03:11:31,020
Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.

3003
03:11:31,020 --> 03:11:32,659
All right, do I not have armor on?

3004
03:11:32,659 --> 03:11:43,739
It's too late, I can get it right here.

3005
03:11:43,739 --> 03:11:45,139
I still got hit by it, shit.

3006
03:11:45,139 --> 03:11:48,459
It's gonna come down to literally seconds on the clock.

3007
03:11:48,459 --> 03:11:54,200
Shoot him, I can't, he's invincible.

3008
03:11:54,200 --> 03:11:55,959
Where is my character?

3009
03:11:55,959 --> 03:11:58,569
Why is the shield not out?

3010
03:11:58,569 --> 03:12:15,459
I don't get this game, half the time.

3011
03:12:15,459 --> 03:12:22,409
Oh my God.

3012
03:12:22,409 --> 03:12:27,389
All right, shoot me, shoot me, go!

3013
03:12:27,389 --> 03:12:37,620
Fuck you, motherfucker!

3014
03:12:37,620 --> 03:12:46,659
No!

3015
03:12:46,659 --> 03:12:52,450
Come here!

3016
03:12:52,450 --> 03:12:53,290
No!

3017
03:12:54,729 --> 03:12:56,129
Do it again, quick!

3018
03:12:56,129 --> 03:13:03,340
Do it again, do it again, do it again!

3019
03:13:03,340 --> 03:13:04,180
No!

3020
03:13:06,250 --> 03:13:09,989
Yeah!

3021
03:13:09,989 --> 03:13:17,540
I did it!

3022
03:13:17,540 --> 03:13:23,010
With 30, with like 25 seconds to go.

3023
03:13:23,010 --> 03:13:39,670
Yes!

3024
03:13:39,670 --> 03:13:40,790
The answer is no.

3025
03:13:51,909 --> 03:13:54,750
Oh, there's a phase two, of course there is.

3026
03:13:54,750 --> 03:13:57,430
Shit, oh, that was so cool.

3027
03:13:57,430 --> 03:14:02,850
Can we just pretend that it was that?

3028
03:14:02,850 --> 03:14:04,290
Oh, I feel bad.

3029
03:14:14,610 --> 03:14:17,709
It was literally the save, fuck up.

3030
03:14:17,750 --> 03:14:23,290
Well, why is, you can't just save more frequently, hey?

3031
03:14:23,290 --> 03:14:29,420
Why do I have to make 10 fucking family dinners

3032
03:14:29,420 --> 03:14:39,069
and not get an auto-save?

3033
03:14:39,069 --> 03:14:42,540
You sit there, I sit there and cook for 15 straight minutes

3034
03:14:42,540 --> 03:14:56,590
and I don't get an auto-save?

3035
03:14:56,590 --> 03:14:58,909
10 restaurant style meals, that's right.

3036
03:15:04,389 --> 03:15:12,700
Uh-oh, okay.

3037
03:15:12,700 --> 03:15:14,260
This is probably gonna be hard.

3038
03:15:25,979 --> 03:15:27,940
There's Frank!

3039
03:15:27,940 --> 03:15:30,299
Frank, you've been there the whole time.

3040
03:15:30,299 --> 03:15:43,430
Come on, Frank, let's do it.

3041
03:15:43,430 --> 03:15:45,030
Is this like a dodge ball scenario,

3042
03:15:45,030 --> 03:15:50,100
like whoever gets to it first?

3043
03:15:50,100 --> 03:15:52,879
The bow of light.

3044
03:15:52,879 --> 03:15:55,040
Okay.

3045
03:15:55,040 --> 03:16:09,979
Oh, this is, all right, let's go.

3046
03:16:09,979 --> 03:16:25,409
Oh, come over here, come here, I need to get on.

3047
03:16:25,409 --> 03:16:54,680
Do I have infinite arrows?

3048
03:16:54,680 --> 03:16:55,920
All right, I have to shoot them.

3049
03:16:55,920 --> 03:16:59,629
In like, where?

3050
03:16:59,629 --> 03:17:01,790
Oh my God!

3051
03:17:01,790 --> 03:17:19,159
It's because A is not where I want it to be.

3052
03:17:19,159 --> 03:17:34,659
What the hell?

3053
03:17:34,659 --> 03:17:41,819
On the other side, I'm imagining, right?

3054
03:17:41,819 --> 03:17:43,540
Or no, shoot them?

3055
03:17:57,059 --> 03:18:04,180
Oh, I have to wait.

3056
03:18:04,180 --> 03:18:25,170
Too far away?

3057
03:18:25,170 --> 03:18:33,899
Stuck in a tree.

3058
03:18:33,899 --> 03:18:34,940
Okay.

3059
03:18:34,940 --> 03:18:35,940
Thanks everybody for watching

3060
03:18:35,940 --> 03:18:37,620
The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.

3061
03:18:37,620 --> 03:18:39,340
The second that the boss's health goes to zero,

3062
03:18:39,340 --> 03:18:47,700
I'm uninstalling the game.

3063
03:18:47,700 --> 03:18:48,620
No, turn!

3064
03:18:50,819 --> 03:18:52,500
Frank, I, you know what, Frank?

3065
03:18:52,500 --> 03:19:01,639
I don't, remember B is A and A is B.

3066
03:19:01,639 --> 03:19:06,180
It's underneath him.

3067
03:19:07,020 --> 03:19:07,860
Get over here, come on, come on.

3068
03:19:07,860 --> 03:19:08,780
Over here, over here, quick.

3069
03:19:08,780 --> 03:19:17,659
I need you over here right now, please.

3070
03:19:17,659 --> 03:19:18,500
Look up there.

3071
03:19:22,250 --> 03:19:25,610
What am I looking at?

3072
03:19:25,610 --> 03:19:26,770
Oh, wow.

3073
03:19:26,770 --> 03:19:27,610
On his head.

3074
03:19:48,790 --> 03:20:06,569
I did it.

3075
03:20:06,569 --> 03:20:10,600
Hey, I beat the actual boss before the timer went out.

3076
03:20:10,600 --> 03:20:11,440
This is the,

3077
03:20:11,440 --> 03:20:21,020
would you consider this an extended cut scene?

3078
03:20:21,020 --> 03:20:23,219
I guess I technically did have to play it

3079
03:20:23,219 --> 03:20:51,209
and I did almost lose, so, true.

3080
03:20:51,209 --> 03:20:52,770
So how does this game leave Ganon?

3081
03:20:52,770 --> 03:20:54,329
That's what I'm curious about.

3082
03:21:14,030 --> 03:21:28,809
Damn.

3083
03:21:28,809 --> 03:21:32,420
Got him in a Ghostbuster trap, that's good.

3084
03:21:32,420 --> 03:21:37,379
Put him into the, put him into the generator.

3085
03:21:37,379 --> 03:21:54,489
We got him, all right.

3086
03:21:58,219 --> 03:22:00,059
Congrats from five years ago.

3087
03:22:01,260 --> 03:22:02,100
That's true.

3088
03:22:05,069 --> 03:22:05,909
Well, no.

3089
03:22:07,510 --> 03:22:08,389
A year and a half?

3090
03:22:19,190 --> 03:22:20,510
Time for Punch-Out?

3091
03:22:20,510 --> 03:22:27,399
Yeah, we'll move to Punch-Out.

3092
03:22:30,559 --> 03:22:46,260
How can you remember me?

3093
03:22:46,260 --> 03:22:53,959
Dun-dun-dun-dun.

3094
03:22:53,959 --> 03:23:07,940
The Legend of Zelda, Breath of the Wild.

3095
03:23:07,940 --> 03:23:20,819
Presented by Nintendo.

3096
03:23:20,819 --> 03:23:26,180
Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.

3097
03:23:26,180 --> 03:23:27,020
All right, I did it.

3098
03:23:27,020 --> 03:23:28,020
I beat Breath of the Wild.

3099
03:23:28,020 --> 03:23:40,379
I told you I would do it before the year was over.

3100
03:23:40,379 --> 03:23:43,059
My three hour estimate was very close, it was.

3101
03:23:43,059 --> 03:23:45,899
It just, it was a little bit of some fumbling

3102
03:23:45,899 --> 03:23:53,299
with the save system.

3103
03:23:53,299 --> 03:23:56,799
Is there an after credit scene or anything?

3104
03:23:56,799 --> 03:24:01,700
You had so much fun, didn't you?

3105
03:24:01,700 --> 03:24:03,780
Yeah, you had so much, I think, is that,

3106
03:24:04,299 --> 03:24:05,139
or I think the person's making a,

3107
03:24:05,139 --> 03:24:06,700
like a you didn't have fun joke.

3108
03:24:15,079 --> 03:24:18,139
It was all in just, no capitals, just,

3109
03:24:18,139 --> 03:24:22,700
yeah, you had so much fun.

3110
03:24:22,700 --> 03:24:23,780
I did.

3111
03:24:23,780 --> 03:24:24,620
I had fun.

3112
03:24:24,620 --> 03:24:32,340
I had fun playing Breath of the Wild.

3113
03:24:32,340 --> 03:24:34,489
It was fun.

3114
03:24:34,489 --> 03:24:37,149
I had fun.

3115
03:24:37,149 --> 03:24:39,790
I will not be playing Tears of the Kingdom.

3116
03:24:39,790 --> 03:24:41,610
It's not gonna happen.

3117
03:24:41,610 --> 03:24:42,850
It's not gonna play.

3118
03:24:46,989 --> 03:24:53,479
Just something that's not in the immediate cards right now.

3119
03:24:53,479 --> 03:24:56,270
And I'm just kidding, I have it installed right now.

3120
03:24:56,270 --> 03:25:01,620
And we're moving to it immediately.

3121
03:25:01,620 --> 03:25:05,840
That was also a lie.

3122
03:25:05,840 --> 03:25:06,680
I don't know where the truth is

3123
03:25:06,680 --> 03:25:09,319
in that last two sentences.

3124
03:25:09,319 --> 03:25:10,159
No, it was fun.

3125
03:25:10,159 --> 03:25:11,000
I wanted to play it.

3126
03:25:11,000 --> 03:25:12,620
I wanted to beat it.

3127
03:25:12,620 --> 03:25:14,780
Gave me an opportunity to actually see this game

3128
03:25:14,780 --> 03:25:17,459
for what it was, which was a great open world experience.

3129
03:25:17,459 --> 03:25:19,059
Tons of fun stuff to do.

3130
03:25:19,059 --> 03:25:23,629
Divine Beasts.

3131
03:25:23,629 --> 03:25:26,709
I have some complaints about the control scheme.

3132
03:25:26,709 --> 03:25:27,989
That's it.

3133
03:25:27,989 --> 03:25:33,500
I also have a few complaints about the,

3134
03:25:33,500 --> 03:25:37,219
this isn't, no, not add, what?

3135
03:25:38,180 --> 03:25:40,100
Somebody just wrote, laughing my ass off.

3136
03:25:40,100 --> 03:25:47,260
Like, oh, here it comes.

3137
03:25:47,260 --> 03:25:48,139
No, it was great.

3138
03:25:48,139 --> 03:25:48,979
I liked it.

3139
03:25:48,979 --> 03:25:51,340
I liked it a lot.

3140
03:25:51,340 --> 03:25:52,180
I'll give you something.

3141
03:25:52,180 --> 03:25:54,799
This is the first Zelda game I have completed

3142
03:25:54,799 --> 03:25:59,549
since Ocarina of Time.

3143
03:25:59,549 --> 03:26:01,950
This is the first Zelda game I have played truly,

3144
03:26:01,950 --> 03:26:04,659
actually since Ocarina of Time.

3145
03:26:04,659 --> 03:26:06,500
I don't really play Zelda games.

3146
03:26:06,500 --> 03:26:09,379
I'm not really into the franchise at all,

3147
03:26:09,379 --> 03:26:12,030
but this was really good.

3148
03:26:12,030 --> 03:26:15,559
I liked it a lot.

3149
03:26:15,559 --> 03:26:25,159
Is there an after credit scene?

3150
03:26:25,159 --> 03:26:26,079
Play Twilight Princess.

3151
03:26:26,079 --> 03:26:27,360
I can't play Twilight Princess

3152
03:26:27,360 --> 03:26:32,530
because it's chlorine eyes simulator.

3153
03:26:32,530 --> 03:26:34,530
Everything, every light I look at just has,

3154
03:26:34,530 --> 03:26:36,010
it's like I was swimming in a chlorine pool

3155
03:26:36,010 --> 03:26:53,579
for like an hour.

3156
03:26:53,579 --> 03:26:54,500
All right, cool.

3157
03:26:54,500 --> 03:26:59,670
Well, there's Breath of the Wild.

3158
03:26:59,670 --> 03:27:03,709
Should I press a button or anything?

3159
03:27:03,709 --> 03:27:05,670
I have heard Wind Waker is amazing.

3160
03:27:05,670 --> 03:27:07,430
Everybody recommends that game.

3161
03:27:07,430 --> 03:27:14,139
Maybe I'll play it.

3162
03:27:14,139 --> 03:27:14,979
I'm glad you beat it.

3163
03:27:14,979 --> 03:27:16,899
Me too.

3164
03:27:16,899 --> 03:27:21,569
Hey, I'll tell you though, these streams,

3165
03:27:21,569 --> 03:27:24,590
I think were some of the funnest streams.

3166
03:27:24,590 --> 03:27:25,870
I feel like there was a lot of fun times

3167
03:27:25,870 --> 03:27:30,860
on the Breath of the Wild streams.

3168
03:27:30,860 --> 03:27:31,819
Stressful a lot of times.

3169
03:27:31,819 --> 03:27:35,959
Yeah, but it was fun.

3170
03:27:35,959 --> 03:27:37,719
It's one of those games that just has a giant open world

3171
03:27:37,719 --> 03:27:39,159
with a bunch of funny stuff that can happen.

3172
03:27:39,159 --> 03:27:40,000
I love those games.

3173
03:27:40,000 --> 03:27:47,610
So I guess you could say I really liked it.

3174
03:27:47,610 --> 03:27:49,049
All right, now let me try to do the punch out thing.

3175
03:27:49,049 --> 03:28:01,200
See if I can do it.

3176
03:28:01,200 --> 03:28:04,290
Tears of the Kingdom is better in that aspect.

3177
03:28:04,290 --> 03:28:07,020
You know, it's funny because people have told me,

3178
03:28:07,020 --> 03:28:09,139
hey, I know you like Breath of the Wild,

3179
03:28:09,139 --> 03:28:11,540
but you'd like to see some things different in it.

3180
03:28:11,540 --> 03:28:14,110
That's Tears of the Kingdom.

3181
03:28:14,110 --> 03:28:16,510
So like is Tears of the Kingdom the Breath of the Wild

3182
03:28:16,510 --> 03:28:18,379
that I would have loved?

3183
03:28:18,379 --> 03:28:26,319
I guess is the question.

3184
03:28:26,319 --> 03:28:31,840
Not really, maybe, yeah, probably.

3185
03:28:31,840 --> 03:28:33,079
I think it really depends, right?

3186
03:28:33,079 --> 03:28:35,700
I guess it's possible I would play Tears of the Kingdom

3187
03:28:35,700 --> 03:28:37,579
and prefer Breath of the Wild.

3188
03:28:37,620 --> 03:28:41,469
Maybe, I don't know.

3189
03:28:41,469 --> 03:28:54,379
Some complaints remain and yeah, a lot of funny stuff.

3190
03:28:54,379 --> 03:28:55,219
That's cool.

3191
03:28:55,219 --> 03:28:58,469
All right, well, I'm ready to play punch out.

3192
03:28:58,469 --> 03:29:00,190
I promised I would beat Breath of the Wild.

3193
03:29:00,190 --> 03:29:01,870
That was not Tears of the Kingdom.

3194
03:29:01,870 --> 03:29:04,340
I know a lot of people may have been like,

3195
03:29:04,340 --> 03:29:07,579
what is he, why is he playing this game?

3196
03:29:07,579 --> 03:29:09,819
But yeah, finished it.

3197
03:29:09,819 --> 03:29:12,020
Hell yeah, I'm happy about it.

3198
03:29:12,020 --> 03:29:13,860
All right, now let me go pee

3199
03:29:13,860 --> 03:29:14,700
and then we're gonna come back

3200
03:29:14,700 --> 03:29:17,719
and do the punch out challenge.

3201
03:29:17,719 --> 03:29:18,680
I'll be right back.
