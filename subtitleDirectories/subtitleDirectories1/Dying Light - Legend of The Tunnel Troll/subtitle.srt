1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:13,839
Okay, so that's what that does. It's head came off. Yeah. Interesting. Okay.

2
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:28,219
Interesting. Sir, you appear to be on fire. What? Why? I thought I had more health than that.

3
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:49,179
You just instant died. That was okay. Funny. Funny. Funny. Funny. Funny.

4
00:00:49,899 --> 00:01:02,829
Skip. Skip. Skip. Ah. It's going in my video. It's going in my video. Yes, it is. No, it's not.

5
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:08,989
What's your response to what you just did? Very quickly. I want to hear what's your response.

6
00:01:08,989 --> 00:01:17,810
I'm bored. I've got my gun. Oh, what do you guys got? What's going on over here, boys?

7
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,489
Put your hands up. Put your hands up. Hands in the air.

8
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:47,150
Yeah, you need to. I destroyed it. That was like my game crashed. I'm trying to like negotiate

9
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:53,569
with the guy. He threw a fucking axe in his head. He looks left and right like what the fuck do I

10
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:59,090
do now? Yeah, he was like still all right. He had no idea what to do. He was like shocked. Yeah,

11
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,890
you threw the axe in his head and for that like two seconds he was just like, oh shit. Okay,

12
00:02:03,969 --> 00:02:09,569
there's an axe in my fucking head. What am I doing? Do I run away? Got real dark real quick.

13
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:14,610
I gotta grab some food or some supplies somewhere. Can I eat these trees? I don't know. I really

14
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:20,129
just don't know anything about where I am right now. Who goes there? This is the tunnel and I'm

15
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:25,250
its troll. What do you want? No, I did. I just was looking for some food, looking for some supplies.

16
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,569
I just wanted to find something. Want to come in? I have food and supplies. I have both of those. I

17
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:35,819
have a lot of them. Is this some kind of trick? No, I'm not a troll. All right, I believe you.

18
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:40,620
Come in, come in. What do you got back? Do you have like, do you have any? What happened?

19
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:48,620
Just you wait 30 or 40 seconds something. Didn't work. You gotta do it again. Can I eat these

20
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,900
trees? Maybe I can chew on the bark and get some syrup. I really don't know. I'm just, what is that?

21
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,939
Who goes there? Who tries to enter the tunnel of the troll? Not me. I was just looking for some

22
00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:04,219
supplies and maybe some food to eat. Well, hey, I have supplies and food all back here. If you

23
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:08,379
just want to come in the tunnel for a second. Some kind of trick. No, I'm not a troll. Oh,

24
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:15,340
okay. I believe you. I really hope you have, I hope you have pizza rolls. What's this? What

25
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:20,539
have you done to me? What have you done? I just wait like 30 to 40 seconds microwave. What are

26
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:30,189
you talking about? What am I waiting 30 or 40 seconds? This joke is so bad. It is, it really is.

27
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:36,699
This is worse than the fucking jump through the glass Pop-Tart joke. I'm gonna get you.

28
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:40,539
I'm gonna get those secrets. I'm gonna get those troll secrets. I'll get those troll secrets.

29
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:46,060
They're my secrets. Get away from me. Get away from me. I'm a troll. I'm a troll. I fucking hate

30
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:58,060
troll secrets. Why can't we not get the fuck off this stupid troll joke? I'm gonna, I'm dropping

31
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:05,500
out. We have to, we have to stop this now. Hey, it's me. Made it on top of one of the towers.

32
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,400
You know we're both jumping off, right? You think we're not going to do that?

33
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:20,189
There's a fucking zombie up here. Hold on. Don't, don't do anything to him. How would you have ever

34
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:26,269
made it up here? She doesn't even have a arm. This zombie is armed, one armed climbed up here.

35
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:40,500
Are you telling me that's what happened? No way. What if she got up and just climbed back up?

36
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:51,649
Oh. Hurry, quickly, quickly, hurry. Oh, what the hell? It's a spinner.

37
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:57,089
Oh, that cut scene just healed me. I'm shouting because this fucked up infected motherfucker

38
00:04:57,089 --> 00:05:02,689
with guts hanging out of his mouth just spit a bunch of toxic snot at me. This motherfucker,

39
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:11,730
toxic motherfucker was fucking snotting his mouth. Turn your light off. Oh, look, there's like a door

40
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:19,060
here. What? Oh, whoa. I thought it was real. All right. I want you to go through my time travel

41
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:25,540
machine. As you see here, my lovely assistant head on through and I'll see you in the year 1900.

42
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,139
Oh, that's not as funny as I thought it was going to be.

43
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:45,680
Hey, it's okay. Are you all right, sir? Hey, you just dropped like 10,000 feet. I'm glad you're

44
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:53,149
like, okay, let's say what were we doing earlier? Let's go. Let's do parkour and jump. Oh, what are

45
00:05:53,149 --> 00:06:04,139
you doing? What does it look like I'm doing right now? What are you doing? I'm pushing the boat.

46
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:15,660
No, what is he doing? You don't know what it looks like for you guys. I just want to ride the boat.

47
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:31,310
Yeah. Your animation looks ridiculous for me. You're gonna get it. I got it. You got it. Got it. Got

48
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:38,860
it. I got it. You got it. All right, my turn. How did you even attempt to do that? I have no idea

49
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,540
how you even there's a place you can stand where it's like completely it's really, really easy to

50
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:48,860
do. All right. What if I like start to start to fall and can I grab it? Maybe? No, I wouldn't do

51
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:55,100
it that way. Go for it. Look what I did. You want to talk about like falling and grabbing onto

52
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:05,279
something? Wow, Joe is the master of falling. I'm fucking the man. Back to square one. Everyone,

53
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:12,879
I want all the actors. That's no shit. No, dude. Just wait. Just wait like 30 seconds. Yeah. Guess

54
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:22,980
what? They're gonna come on. No, get the fuck out of here. Run, run, run.
