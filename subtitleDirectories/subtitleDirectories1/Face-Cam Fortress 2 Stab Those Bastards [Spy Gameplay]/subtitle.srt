00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,380
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2, Saturday's edition.

2
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:21,219
And, oh, I just got a headshot. Today I'm gonna be, as you see, playing as the spy in this

3
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:29,059
beautiful Saturday afternoon. And we're gonna, like, lose right now. I never play spy, live

4
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:36,380
at least, and you are getting backstabbed. No, you're not. Um, we are gonna, pfft. Well,

5
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:42,869
I can't even think. Let's get out here. This is on a bad water, as you can probably see.

6
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:50,899
On the, uh, on the screen here. Let me kill this heavy. This heavy medic bear are dead.

7
00:00:50,899 --> 00:01:03,240
They are toast. One, oh, give me that headshot. I got it. What's going on? I'm stuck. Oh my god,

8
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:10,890
I'm, like, legit stuck in that thing. I'm just, like, standing. That was stupid. I got, like,

9
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:21,480
legit sandwiched into, like, the wedge of that dome thing. Ah, that's a good V8 fusion. Oh my

10
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:34,420
god, this is a long respawn here. So, spy, you know, I wanna take something off, but I don't

11
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:39,739
wanna take something off. We're just gonna stick with it, you know, whatever. We can hold him for

12
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:51,140
over seven minutes. Probably not. Oh, you know, I wanna go as a, oh, let me just, like, turn this

13
00:01:51,140 --> 00:02:05,829
corner. Hi, everybody. Like, I'm just dead. I'm still bergafone. I need to, like, change my,

14
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:17,370
god, at least he killed him. Frontier justice. Come on, back up right into me. Back up right into

15
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:28,969
me. Oh, the anger in that knife. Why am I standing right in the open here? Oh, let's change to a pyro

16
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:38,620
right here. See if I can't do something. Oh, I just, like, that guy knew.

17
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:46,180
I should have just jumped down. What am I doing? Instead, I just stared right at the guy's face. I

18
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:53,900
was just like, hi, like, I spy, like, who are you? Should have jumped down and stabbed the heavy,

19
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,060
but no. I wanted to get overzealous. I wanted to get behind everybody. That was a stupid idea,

20
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:06,180
but it's okay, because they still have not gotten close to capping this. They were close. Not

21
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:17,030
anymore, though. Oh, let's go sniper. I'm gonna take out the SMG. Oh, by the way, if you don't

22
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:23,289
know what I'm doing, I'm hitting B when I change my weapons. When you do that, you switch to your,

23
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:34,949
I just feel bad about that. You switch to the weapon that's in that slot for that class. Oh,

24
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:40,229
my god, that was sick. That wasn't even my, I didn't even do that either. Oh, my god, I gotta

25
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:49,659
play. That was just like the sloppiest, like, oh, spy. That was one of the sloppiest, like,

26
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:59,300
that was a reverse stair stab. He, like, jumped over me, and I'm back. Oh, my god. That guy just

27
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:07,979
killed himself. Oh, my god. This is turning out to be, like, quite the spy round. Like, so much

28
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:21,180
goofy crap happened. Oh, what are you gonna shoot? I wanted to shoot him in the face so bad. Why

29
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:37,139
didn't the first one register? God dang it. Oh, what the hell was in that? Oh, all right. Well,

30
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:41,779
you just got, like, a live reaction of me swallowing, like, a mosquito that was in my drink.

31
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:58,089
Hell. Is Otto still in here? Oh, shh. Okay, let's do this now. Let's do this.

32
00:05:00,089 --> 00:05:03,850
Gotta get in the try hard mode. That's when my eyes peer down like that. It means I'm, like,

33
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:11,610
trying really hard. And it means this guy is, what a nice shot that was. Holy crap. What is

34
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:16,790
this guy doing? I can't, like, decloak next to him because, like, that guy, wow, I just, like,

35
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:28,569
screwed myself up. Maybe he won't even know. Oh, he won't know. Oh, get him. Any snipers? There is

36
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:34,970
a sniper. Oh, come on. Give me that headshot. Oh, give me that headshot. Give it to me. I want it

37
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:56,089
so bad. I want it so, mmmm. No. Oh, God. Oh, well. You can't get them all. Wish I could,

38
00:05:56,089 --> 00:06:04,149
though. Oh, I'm, like, this thing's had given me, like, burp gas, too. Like, jeez Louise. I'm gonna,

39
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:13,209
like, puke on the screen. You are definitely an actual engineer. I'm sorry for ever doubting you.

40
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:18,100
I gotta stop changing to the same damn thing over and over again. Let's go.

41
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:23,110
So, uh, alright, let's do this.

42
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:29,339
Get on that cot, guys, we gotta like save the day, and I just bumped into somebody.

43
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:33,769
I might as well just, okay, thank you.

44
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:36,540
Thank you.

45
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,259
Alright, this guy, I'm gonna get it this time.

46
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:42,699
Alright, I got it that time.

47
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:50,230
If I screwed that one up, I would have peed my pants.

48
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,350
I killed this, what?

49
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:57,019
What just even happened right there?

50
00:06:57,019 --> 00:07:02,629
Okay, I'm like flabbergasted right now.

51
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:09,879
Oh, Heavy, you don't even know what's going on here.

52
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:17,709
Now I gotta run all the way, you know what, I hate when that happens.

53
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:21,430
You see, I had a beeline for that Heavy, but there was like a sentry going up.

54
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:25,379
See, I was gonna do what this guy just did, you know, maybe he just succeeded.

55
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:26,560
Let's see, come on.

56
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,459
Oh, it's okay.

57
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:34,259
Surprisingly, we have held this for this long, and oh, come on, we can't lose this.

58
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:38,959
What did that guy say?

59
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,079
I have my voice turned down so low, I can't hear anything.

60
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:47,220
Oh, the power jack.

61
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,220
Get that.

62
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,220
Get up.

63
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,220
That's fine.

64
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,670
Let's go Heavy.

65
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:55,949
This guy doesn't know the Heavy.

66
00:07:55,949 --> 00:07:56,949
Doctor!

67
00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:00,470
That's what I wanted.

68
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,470
That's what I wanted.

69
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:04,879
Oh, why didn't I bring it out?

70
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,360
How much, hold on, how much health did I just have right there?

71
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,149
Did I have 180 health?

72
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:15,370
I didn't even like pay attention.

73
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:21,779
That item is really awesome and totally fine to use.

74
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:29,980
We're gonna win.

75
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,980
Nice smash.

76
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,960
Nice smash, dude.

77
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,559
Nice smash, dude.

78
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,299
Okay.

79
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,899
All right, don't screw this up.

80
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:42,539
Let's go, let's go, baby.

81
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:48,940
Oh, don't screw this up now, baby.

82
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,580
He is gonna spray everywhere.

83
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,980
No, don't turn around, don't turn around.

84
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,980
Oh!

85
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,740
We're gonna win.

86
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,740
We'll win.

87
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,500
See, when I play Spy, this is how I get.

88
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:08,879
I get like, I get like all shaky and jittery and crazy, especially live.

89
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:10,600
We're gonna do it.

90
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
Last point defense.

91
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,019
Oh, oh, I don't know.

92
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:18,659
Still a demo man, still a demo man on the point.

93
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:21,399
No, that's it.

94
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,399
That's it.

95
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,399
Good game, guys.

96
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,399
Nice job, team.

97
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,700
Top.

98
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,600
Okay, I'll take it.

99
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,600
That's gonna be it.

100
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,919
Thanks a lot, guys, for watching.

101
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:30,919
And let me get one person.

102
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:34,179
Let me just like smoke one person, come on.

103
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:37,320
You took it from me.

104
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,759
But yeah, take care, buddy.

105
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:42,340
And I'll see you guys all next time.

106
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,230
Otto, are you sleeping still?
