10
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:19,500

00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:27,170
Maybe I'll play it. It's it's ready if this game's not any fun

00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:16,509
Casino ink is a casino management game. You make a casino and you run it. I'm all over this

20
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:19,879
This game came out like 15 years ago

21
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:27,009
So I wish they'd make a new one. I want a new up-to-date casino like we're gonna be good

22
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:30,250
You gotta set the fucking restaurants the hotels the tables

23
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:34,210
They could be troublemakers. You have to throw out of the casino. It's gonna be a lot of fun

24
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:47,620
I like beautiful Joe to people happy me too. Thank god. It's not beautiful Joe. I okay

All right

27
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:58,419
if you remember when I played Kenshi and I got like three or four streams into Kenshi and it was like

00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:04,139
Get off this game. It's like don't ever play this game again. This game's boring. It's game sucks

29
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:10,189
That was like beautiful Joe was like Kenshi too. It was wild

30
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:18,500
Kenshi is great though. Yeah, but hey, you live and die by the

31
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:21,259
By the chat hive mind, I think

32
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:34,610
And she actually sucks though see what I'm saying now imagine imagine that five thousand times

33
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:43,819
And she is good

34
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:46,969
But without further ado

I'm gonna fucking have all kinds of like blackjack tables are gonna be slots. You can make an arcade in this game. Yep

37
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:03,449
You don't have to make a casino. You can make an arcade with arcade machines and pinball machines

38
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,330
You don't have to make a casino not money doesn't have to be involved at all

39
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,849
Chad is like an untrained dog

40
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,270
You have to be the alpha male

41
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:17,189
right

42
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:19,189

43
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:24,019
There's 5 000 untrained dogs are all running at you at the same time. Am I gonna

00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:30,550
Start banning people start timing out five three four five thousand different people

45
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:34,259
Maybe I will

46
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:35,850
Maybe I will

47
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,290
Maybe i'll start to lock it down. Maybe maybe i'll start to lock it down

48
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,189
I would be careful if I were you chat

49
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,339
You're on thin ice

50
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:53,050
And then my chest just fucking sticks out and I lean my neck back

00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:28,740
That's just temporary because it's an old it's like a game from like fucking 1993 or something konami

56
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,980

Okay chip city demands that you can't read this but i'll just read it to you chip city demands the best from you

93
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,629
It's the hardest city in casino inc little hope springs

Is the perfect challenge with which to start so this is just in difficulty. This is just difficulty

So we can do one two, three four is one through six in difficulty. I'm not doing chip city

96
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,240
I'm not starting at the hardest fucking difficulty. This is probably a hard game chip city is based

No, we're going to like fortune falls. I'm doing fortune falls

Fortune falls is a mid-sized city with plenty of nightlife to attract visitors bars restaurants theaters nightclubs fast food outlets and entertainment of a

Sleazier nature are all there to entice your would-be customers added to all that three casino owning companies have a head start on you

100
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:42,110
Your ultimate aim is to dominate the gambling and entertainment markets and to put two of the three major competitor casinos out of business

101
00:10:42,429 --> 00:10:47,549
In addition to building an efficient business empire, you will need to use cheats troublemakers and hitmen

102
00:10:48,330 --> 00:11:00,509
Exclusively extensively to harm your opponents. This is why they like command points the challenge in fortune falls shouldn't be underestimated

00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:58,919
Not only will you have to build and manage your own gambling and entertainment empire

111
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,440
You also have to actively win customers. Don't worry. I will that's a good face cam. Yeah

My job is head post if you settle in and show you how to experience that

Visitors arrive the busy railroad terminal. There are several one and boston road nearby

119

00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:48,700
Okay, so they come in on rail on the railroad terminal

00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:52,299
There are several one and two star hotels nearby

122
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,259
City has good transport links from here to the better quality hotels. Okay

123
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:06,639
At the heart of the city the central square houses the courthouse and the conference restaurants bars and theaters

124
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,639
This is where we want to go

125
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,539
During the tour you can scroll the views. Yeah. Yeah, I know

126
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,230
Who are these people?

127
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:22,759
Oh, it's a senior because he's looking for something to do. We gotta get we gotta give the seniors something to do

128
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,320
Holy shit. This guy's locked in

129
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:30,379
This guy this is a hell for this guy. Imagine being in this fucking position

130
00:13:32,409 --> 00:13:34,570
A bus in front of you and a bus behind you

131
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,690
Holy shit, that's the worst possible scenario

132
00:13:38,169 --> 00:13:39,210
Okay

133
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,259
Let's keep going

134
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:47,399
One in the central square is west street. Your casino lies at the far end of it

135
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:53,559
Competition for customers looking for cheap food and drink will be fierce here with a cafe and a bar just oh

136
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:58,200
What the fuck you go? Hold on. There's a cafe and a bar across the street and i'm the i'm the casino

137
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,639
I got a bar in here, too

138
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,639
All right. I gotta make my drinks cheaper than that

139
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:08,409
There is the clam clams casino on west street. Yep. All right, I gotta make my shit cheaper

140
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:14,570
Always north street takes visitors from the central square to the intersection with canada street

141
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:17,529
The most popular areas of the city

142
00:14:18,009 --> 00:14:19,690
There are several hotels

143
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:24,090
Canada street boston street canada street tennessee street

144
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:28,080
england street

145
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:33,360
Just across the road in a great position to win customers is your first rival casino

146
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:37,659
The owner has already told us he intends to make life difficult

147
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,159
Really? Okay, just across the road

148
00:14:43,289 --> 00:14:45,289
Oh shit. All right

149
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,360
Okay, this this this is this is the guy the cheetos casino

150
00:14:50,539 --> 00:14:53,340
Head east from here and you'll reach. Oh, I wish that was me

151
00:14:53,659 --> 00:15:00,559
Although it's conveniently placed between the railroad term. I wish that was me this area houses mainly offices and wastelands

152
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:08,220
Carrying advertising for delights found elsewhere in the city. However, we believe this quieter establishment could wasteland

153
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,830
This place is popular with high rollers

154
00:15:16,909 --> 00:15:20,029
why

155
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:25,049
The crypt to the south of this casino. These are all the ones you were gonna pick

156
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:33,399
This is entertainment capital

157
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,320
Yeah, whatever so

All slots low bet slots or what?

179
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:12,319
Should we just have a bunch of like one cent slot machines that take up the entire casino, but i'll lose money

180
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,180
I won't make any money

494
00:50:56,989 --> 00:51:01,710

00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,719
Casino maze. Yes, every casino is designed to be a maze

565
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:27,519
It's designed for you to never know where the fuck you are

566
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,679
There are no windows

567
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:35,920
And it's there's they they build these architects really in a way so you get turned around every 15 minutes

00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,920
Oh, this is taking all your money, right?

00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:55,579
Drinks doing all right. They're okay. We need some seating near the bar

00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:57,650
Palm tree plants. I gotta put some like plants too

586
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:01,739

00:59:01,739 --> 00:59:04,059
All right planting that corner and planting this corner as well

588
00:59:04,699 --> 00:59:06,699

I like plant too

593
00:59:23,409 --> 00:59:29,380
Nice, okay

594
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:33,409
It's uneven. Yeah, what it's who cares?

595
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:41,710
There's only one old guy playing blackjack

596
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:45,619
Seriously

597
00:59:45,619 --> 00:59:47,619
Why does nobody want to play this?

598
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:57,579
Lost a lot of money here. What happened three days ago? We hit a big jackpot

599
00:59:58,059 --> 01:00:01,579
Nobody bet a bunch of money. That's why I put the minimums low lower the minimums again

600
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:07,420
I mean lower lower the maximum 50 max. I don't want somebody doing like 50. That's three or four

601
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:09,820
Yeah, whatever get the fuck out of here

602
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:14,940
I don't want somebody doing like oh i'm gonna put down like 250 250 bang bang hit hit hit hit hit

603
01:00:15,019 --> 01:00:17,260
And you may you make out like five grand. No 50 max

604
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:31,440
Advertise the casino not yet. Not until i'm comfortable with how many slot machines i'm gonna do another row right here of low quality slots

605
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:34,480
And i'm gonna put two super slots right here

606
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:40,590
high bet slot machine

607
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:42,590
One two three right in the corner right here

608
01:00:49,019 --> 01:00:51,659
Yep, there we go. Okay, these are expensive

609
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:54,849
jackpot frequency

610
01:00:54,849 --> 01:00:55,809
high

611
01:00:55,809 --> 01:01:00,320
return percentage

612
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,809
medium

613
01:01:01,809 --> 01:01:03,969
No jackpot frequency low

614
01:01:06,449 --> 01:01:08,449
return percentage medium

615
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:13,940
No high jack. Uh, should they hit more often but low less money?

616
01:01:16,530 --> 01:01:20,210
Remember jackpot frequency does not mean how much money it pays out

617
01:01:20,769 --> 01:01:25,650
That's it. That's this that's just how often they get like a big number like a big. Whoa, I did I hit something

618
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,179
No, that's how it works

619
01:01:30,179 --> 01:01:32,900
That yeah, no, that's how it works. Trust me. That's what the tutorial said

620
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:39,780
High return low frequency

621
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:44,849
Okay, that's wrong. No, that's what the tutorial i'm telling you. That's the tutorial said this

622
01:01:46,139 --> 01:01:51,980
Is that the jackpot frequency does not mean it pays out more money. That's what the return is

623
01:01:52,539 --> 01:01:59,550
We'll do that. We'll let people have some some hits here

624
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:05,119
Low but big hits

625
01:02:07,619 --> 01:02:09,219
All right, where's high?

626
01:02:09,219 --> 01:02:11,280
I'm gonna have to rename these

627
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:21,039
I have a lot of slots

628
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:23,500

629
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:25,500
16 low high. All right, they're good

630
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:31,460
I'm almost at okay. I have to stop moving around. I gotta i'm running out of money

631
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:35,309
Our biggest customers

632
01:02:35,309 --> 01:02:40,300
Are the technicians they spend every dollar they make in the casino in the casino

633
01:02:48,050 --> 01:03:02,239

Honestly, why stop at 20 when you can do 50?

1768
02:52:15,190 --> 02:52:17,590
Blackjack is losing money. Yeah, but that keeps them in the casino

1769
02:52:17,829 --> 02:52:21,510
They'll win 100 bucks at blackjack and then they'll blow it all in the high limit slot machine

1770
02:52:25,180 --> 02:52:27,420
Why not a million? I mean, why not? You're right

Imagine they were beating up the old guy down here. That'd be so sad. All right, we got 6200 bucks

1780
02:53:43,450 --> 02:53:45,770

02:53:52,250 --> 02:53:59,540
Blackjack and baccarat are getting crushed the three slot machines. Nobody's playing them at too high

1784
02:54:03,879 --> 02:54:06,920
Why nobody's playing what's the most roulette one is the most profitable thing?

1785
02:54:08,549 --> 02:54:10,950
And all the slots on the left side. Why is nobody playing those?

1786
02:54:11,590 --> 02:54:22,520
I closed blackjack down. Let's go check out the casino. How's it doing?

1787
02:54:27,020 --> 02:54:29,020

He's sprinting to go to the sex show

1796
02:55:18,379 --> 02:55:38,489
I kind of want to see how this plays out

1797
02:55:38,489 --> 02:55:49,639
We voided the cop

1798
02:55:49,639 --> 02:55:51,479
He's not happy

1799
02:55:51,479 --> 02:56:00,629

1800
02:56:06,500 --> 02:56:08,659

03:13:47,510 --> 03:13:53,540
That's enough. Okay. Now I got no one more

1985
03:13:56,149 --> 03:13:58,149
All right. I got good cars moving around

1986
03:13:58,549 --> 03:14:00,549
I'm gonna spend money to make money guys

1987
03:14:00,549 --> 03:14:05,860
How's my hotel doing? Good profit good enough to make it go to 50 dollars a night

1988
03:14:13,030 --> 03:14:15,209
What is this?

1989
03:14:15,209 --> 03:14:16,889
Whoa, this looks like fun

1990
03:14:16,889 --> 03:14:27,350
Can I cheat? All right. What's the best place to where are they both going to the same?

1991
03:14:27,750 --> 03:14:30,100
table

1992
03:14:30,100 --> 03:14:31,219
um

1993
03:14:31,219 --> 03:14:34,420
Guys, I really don't think this is a smart idea to both cheat the same table

1994
03:14:35,059 --> 03:14:49,659
Because if the floor man's right here, you're gonna get caught. All right, get out you go

1995
03:14:50,459 --> 03:14:58,329
Go home take the money do the bait good. I just gotta watch this shit

1996
03:15:01,860 --> 03:15:03,860
The only floor man over here was this

1997
03:15:07,079 --> 03:15:07,959
uh

1998
03:15:07,959 --> 03:15:10,809
Are you telling on me?

1999
03:15:10,809 --> 03:15:40,139
Why is it standing here like this? All right, go down. Let's go to floor two

2000
03:15:41,430 --> 03:15:44,629
This punching bags and oh look at how much fun this stuff is

2001
03:15:45,110 --> 03:15:49,989
I need to make one of these this place isn't really a casino. Is it?

2002
03:15:50,629 --> 03:15:54,600
Is there any slots or anything?

2003
03:15:54,600 --> 03:15:59,559
Oh shit, this is not even a casino. This is their second property. It's an entertainment property

2004
03:16:01,450 --> 03:16:05,079
Fuck there's only three tables up here and this guy

2005
03:16:09,530 --> 03:16:15,129
Can I distract this guy? All right, go to a different casino

2006
03:16:16,760 --> 03:16:18,680
Go to the toy box casino

2007
03:16:18,680 --> 03:16:21,620
This is a bad place to steal

2008
03:16:23,319 --> 03:16:25,079
All right, that's fine

2009
03:16:25,079 --> 03:16:29,110
Back to my property

2010
03:16:37,000 --> 03:16:39,739
All right, this floor needs some serious redesigning

2011
03:16:40,520 --> 03:16:45,879
This is taking money in this is taking money in we need some stuff here

2012
03:16:46,440 --> 03:16:50,600

Small kitchen next to the big kitchen

This can be for appetizers and this can be for main and main entries

2022
03:17:44,090 --> 03:17:55,879
But why I don't know

Go for it

2032
03:18:51,899 --> 03:18:55,819
Let's get some waiters up here. I need three waiters because it's already weird downstairs

2033
03:18:56,540 --> 03:18:58,620
Wait, they can like deliver food downstairs, right?

2034
03:19:01,079 --> 03:19:03,079

2035
03:19:04,260 --> 03:19:06,409
Waiters, we're ready

2036
03:19:06,409 --> 03:19:07,930
Open it up for business

2037
03:19:07,930 --> 03:19:35,239
Give me a wall and dumb ass couch get out of here minus 90. I spent money at the end of the day

2038
03:19:35,719 --> 03:19:38,790
Wages have been paid

2039
03:19:38,870 --> 03:19:41,590
Seating. Okay. How about we need uh internal wall?

2040
03:19:42,309 --> 03:20:01,799
Can I give one more table here?

2041
03:20:01,799 --> 03:20:13,829
Come on in. Okay, you can watch it through here

2042
03:20:14,469 --> 03:20:16,149
Configure the restaurant

2043
03:20:16,149 --> 03:20:21,540
But you're good kitchen. Here we go

2044
03:20:22,440 --> 03:20:28,200
There's a convention starting soon a wizards and witches convention will start in three days. Why did I say three?

2045
03:20:30,979 --> 03:20:33,299
high quality lobsters or french fries

2046
03:20:34,520 --> 03:20:38,100
steaks

2047
03:20:39,700 --> 03:20:43,479
What I mean an air filter

2048
03:20:43,799 --> 03:20:46,940
Is it really heat? Is it just hookers coming to have dinner?

2049
03:20:47,659 --> 03:20:56,309
No one's coming over to eat

2050
03:20:56,309 --> 03:21:14,469
How much is this costing me a week?

2051
03:21:14,549 --> 03:21:16,549
Nobody wants to eat at the nice restaurant

2052
03:21:17,110 --> 03:21:29,139
The sports betting is you should read maybe we should change the minimum too. No, I think that's good where it is actually

2053
03:21:29,780 --> 03:21:38,409
You're hiding it behind a wall. Well, I mean it's a bit that needs to have a little space

2054
03:21:39,209 --> 03:21:45,860
Nobody wants to eat at restaurants with porn grunts. This thing's almost maybe 10 grand. Okay

2055
03:21:46,659 --> 03:21:48,899
It's the best thing in this entire casino

2056
03:21:49,700 --> 03:22:01,030
So it has to stay

2057
03:22:01,030 --> 03:22:03,579
Yeah, get out

2058
03:22:03,579 --> 03:22:06,379
Well, all right. I need something here

2059
03:22:06,379 --> 03:22:08,700
These are still making money. They make it a lot of money actually

2060
03:22:12,379 --> 03:22:14,379
Just only have porn theaters

2061
03:22:14,700 --> 03:22:20,409
The waiters have no purposes that there's in the kitchen on the same floor

2062
03:22:21,450 --> 03:22:23,450
All right, so fire. Uh

2063
03:22:23,610 --> 03:22:25,829

He's like, I can't do it. I can't shoot the old man

2096
03:26:05,430 --> 03:26:13,799
Somebody do something the police are on their way to the casino

2097
03:26:35,430 --> 03:26:38,680
And the elderly

2098
03:26:38,680 --> 03:26:42,600

03:29:53,079 --> 03:29:55,899
You're gonna have to talk to the boss. I've got nothing to fucking do with that

Shoot him right the police are on their way to the casino

2134

A hundred times everybody and he kept asking for a pay raise

2137
03:32:01,290 --> 03:32:04,489
It's like no you're not gonna get a pay raise and then he spit on the guy in the elevator

2138
03:32:04,569 --> 03:32:08,969
You didn't see that part and he pushed him and he shoved him into the wall and the bouncer hit his head

2139
03:32:09,370 --> 03:32:20,989
On the back of the fucking wall, is he still hanging out down here? This garf is kind of freaking me out

03:32:21,229 --> 03:32:32,510
All right, go back upstairs

How's the hotel doing?

2153
03:33:18,120 --> 03:33:21,639
The hotel's doing fantastic. Actually, I just want to build another one

2154
03:33:28,250 --> 03:33:30,969
I could put a few pinball machines over here. No, I need money. I need money

You have how you have a thousand dollars. You don't have anything

2162
03:34:39,370 --> 03:34:42,409
Are there three scoop? What's with the four scooby-doo characters?

2163
03:34:43,049 --> 03:34:45,049
What are they all doing?

2164
03:34:45,049 --> 03:34:59,000
You know, I want to sit at this poker table

2165
03:35:01,120 --> 03:35:05,309
Shit is there another floor here I can go down and and and

2166
03:35:06,110 --> 03:35:09,000

2167
03:35:09,000 --> 03:35:12,680
All right up here. They have so many floor men. It's so hard to cheat here. Oh pianist

2168
03:35:13,559 --> 03:35:18,680
It's so hard. Wait money wheel

2169
03:35:19,659 --> 03:35:23,020
Uh, go play this. I just want you to play it. This place is awesome

2170
03:35:34,909 --> 03:35:43,069
All right, put a bet on um, I don't know five. All right, did we lose him? No, he's coming back

2171
03:35:43,549 --> 03:36:01,440
Police have reopened the floor good. I can't cheat here. There's no opportunity. I mean I could try it

2172
03:36:02,239 --> 03:36:04,079
I could try it back here

2173
03:36:04,079 --> 03:36:06,620
No, it's just everywhere

2174
03:36:06,620 --> 03:36:24,680
Let's just start cheating in front of them. Should I be that ballsy? I mean, he's a five-star cheater

2175
03:36:35,040 --> 03:36:39,719
No, it's not worth it. It's not not worth it. All right, just go home

2176
03:36:40,280 --> 03:36:43,610
I'll take a thousand dollars. How much more do I need?

2177
03:36:44,409 --> 03:36:52,860
Fuck I need more money

2178
03:36:52,860 --> 03:36:58,620
Low jackpot frequency low percentage payout, uh high jackpot frequency low payouts

2179
03:37:04,000 --> 03:37:22,010
Like make them think that they're winning. This place is dead

2180
03:37:23,370 --> 03:37:27,930
I guess it happens when uh, you kill a doorman you shoot a rhino

2181
03:37:28,729 --> 03:37:32,639
and an old guy

2182
03:37:32,719 --> 03:37:34,319
also dies

2183
03:37:34,319 --> 03:37:38,559
That's I guess what happens to your casino you start losing money

2184
03:37:41,129 --> 03:37:45,770
Drunk rhino dies old man belligerently punches through one of the screens and gets shot

2185
03:37:46,569 --> 03:37:48,569
And then we kill the doorman in the basement

2186
03:37:49,530 --> 03:37:53,559
Cool

2187
03:37:53,559 --> 03:37:55,559
I still haven't unlocked these yet

2188
03:37:55,559 --> 03:37:57,879
God damn it. Come on. I need that forty four thousand

2189
03:37:58,520 --> 03:38:08,559
How's the hotel doing hotels? The only thing keeping me afloat right now. I'm gonna have to

2190
03:38:09,790 --> 03:38:16,969
55 dollars a night

2191
03:38:16,969 --> 03:38:18,969
Give garfield a raise. I already did

2192
03:38:25,420 --> 03:38:30,639
1465 bucks in profit. I mean i'm still i'm still in the green

2193
03:38:31,200 --> 03:38:33,200
Not by very much, but I still am

2194
03:38:33,360 --> 03:38:37,790
I need to get a new property. I mean, I have to buy a new property

2195
03:38:38,510 --> 03:38:44,459
Where do I even buy a new property?

2196
03:38:45,020 --> 03:38:57,040
Okay, real estate

2197
03:38:57,040 --> 03:38:59,040
We got how many of these places are open?

2198
03:39:02,170 --> 03:39:04,239
What's what's available?

2199
03:39:04,239 --> 03:39:06,729
cupcake bakery

2200
03:39:06,729 --> 03:39:12,030
snows pawn brokers, these are all 200 grand 160 160 120

2201
03:39:12,889 --> 03:39:14,889
75 go all the way down

2202
03:39:14,889 --> 03:39:16,889
All right. This is a wasteland casino

2203
03:39:17,370 --> 03:39:21,610
These are all 30 000

2204
03:39:21,610 --> 03:39:22,569
No

2205
03:39:22,569 --> 03:39:32,430
Don't have any money just buy a streamer house with eleven thousand dollars. I think you need to add a couple zeros

2206
03:39:33,149 --> 03:39:40,440
There you go. Play it

2207
03:39:40,440 --> 03:39:44,600
Bar is doing all right

2208
03:39:44,600 --> 03:39:48,440
I have some staff that I gotta got we haven't we have a staff bloat problem

2209
03:39:51,420 --> 03:39:53,420
We got janitors standing around in circles

2210
03:39:57,520 --> 03:40:01,440
Let's take a look. What's the bloat here? We got dealers that aren't doing anything good janitors standing around

2211
03:40:03,479 --> 03:40:05,180
You're out

2212
03:40:05,180 --> 03:40:08,360
You're out

2213
03:40:08,360 --> 03:40:11,500
Oh garfield

2214
03:40:11,579 --> 03:40:14,920
Keep you around

2215
03:40:14,920 --> 03:40:21,079
Floor this okay. This floor man's been pretty good actually been been very very very very very very good at sniffing out potential

2216
03:40:21,959 --> 03:40:23,159
cheaters

2217
03:40:23,159 --> 03:40:25,159
This bouncer I think I believe has been pretty good

2218
03:40:25,879 --> 03:40:30,299
There's only two there's three bouncers

2219
03:40:30,700 --> 03:40:32,379
This one's got to go

2220
03:40:32,379 --> 03:40:38,780
All the servers where are you located?

2221
03:40:40,489 --> 03:40:42,329
I think it's time

2222
03:40:42,329 --> 03:40:45,049
Yeah, we it's time to liquidate these nobody. You know, nobody cares

2223
03:40:47,690 --> 03:40:50,889
Look at the profit on these

2224
03:40:50,889 --> 03:40:56,809
These have made a i've been i've been streaming for three and a half hours these went up at least two guys some loot

2225
03:40:57,450 --> 03:41:04,829
These went up probably two and a half hours ago. They've made a hundred dollars. They've made less than three hundred four hundred dollars total

2226
03:41:06,889 --> 03:41:08,250
It's time for them to go

2227
03:41:08,250 --> 03:41:17,709
Let's see

2228
03:41:17,709 --> 03:41:27,690
Where's the food?

2229
03:41:27,690 --> 03:41:29,559
food kiosks

2230
03:41:29,559 --> 03:41:32,520
Six fucking dollars these things made four dollars

2231
03:41:34,299 --> 03:41:38,200
Or six. Yeah, goodbye

2232
03:41:38,200 --> 03:41:40,200
Make the prop the price is reasonable

2233
03:41:40,760 --> 03:41:44,760
I've been always buying them

2234
03:41:44,760 --> 03:41:46,760
This shit is five bucks

2235
03:41:46,920 --> 03:41:48,920
For a good quality hamburger

2236
03:41:50,040 --> 03:41:52,040
Fire at the cheetah casino again

2237
03:41:54,360 --> 03:41:56,360
I'm getting rid of them. I'm gonna put more slots in here

2238
03:41:56,760 --> 03:41:59,239
Foods upstairs. Oh, yeah, you just bought one good

2239
03:41:59,959 --> 03:42:10,219
Yeah, that's it. We gotta get rid of them. Just make a crappy one, but i'll make one this no nobody

2240
03:42:10,219 --> 03:42:13,180
It's ice cream. It's the ice cream. It's the problem. It's the ice cream. It's gone

2241
03:42:14,459 --> 03:42:16,459
Sell for a hundred bucks

2242
03:42:16,780 --> 03:42:19,739
How much did I put this down for this thing is sucks?

2243
03:42:24,780 --> 03:42:27,579
Yeah, but it's not about the profit it's about no one is buying them

2244
03:42:28,809 --> 03:42:30,809
This shit is incredibly reasonable

2245
03:42:32,159 --> 03:42:35,520
Even if I did like four dollars, I mean no one's purchasing these

2246
03:42:37,739 --> 03:42:40,700
And when I put the low quality everyone started throwing up everywhere

2247
03:42:52,120 --> 03:42:57,719
I just watched five people. Yeah, five people just bought for the burger. Do you see do you see the numbers? This is the book

2248
03:43:03,360 --> 03:43:05,360
Look, let's just do food only

2249
03:43:07,000 --> 03:43:11,200
Look the food kiosks, they don't they don't do shit

2250
03:43:11,760 --> 03:43:13,760
They make 20 bucks a day

2251
03:43:14,860 --> 03:43:18,139
We're checking the numbers right now as opposed to for instance

2252
03:43:18,700 --> 03:43:22,540
Like the movie theater the porn theater makes three to six hundred plus dollars a day

2253
03:43:24,329 --> 03:43:26,729
The back of that table loses a thousand dollars

2254
03:43:27,690 --> 03:43:30,409
Uh, well, there's one day somebody probably cheated and I didn't kick them off the table

2255
03:43:30,889 --> 03:43:33,370
Uh slot machine didn't do very well. Yes, but it's fine. Whatever

2256
03:43:37,719 --> 03:43:39,799
No food porn

2257
03:43:39,799 --> 03:43:41,799
It brings people in that's how business works

2258
03:43:42,120 --> 03:43:46,600
I don't try to don't try to lecture me on fucking business. Okay, I try to like to be on business

2259
03:43:49,319 --> 03:43:54,600
I'm the guy that decided to make the expensive drinks only three dollars more than my profit margin. That's business

2260
03:43:54,600 --> 03:43:56,600
The convention is now finished

2261
03:43:57,799 --> 03:44:24,430
Ah, she's gone

2262
03:44:24,430 --> 03:44:34,799
I won

2263
03:44:34,799 --> 03:44:36,459
You're good. All right

2264
03:44:36,459 --> 03:44:38,299
12 000

2265
03:44:38,299 --> 03:44:40,299
They're actually getting the they're actually

2266
03:44:40,299 --> 03:44:42,299
Ordering drinks. I should probably get another bartender

2267
03:44:44,280 --> 03:44:47,559
Another bar another bartender. I'm making money slowly

2268
03:44:48,440 --> 03:44:54,120
What about another ring? Uh another row slot machines slots slots right here. That's what i'm doing

2269
03:44:54,920 --> 03:44:56,920
The low ones the small ones the low bet ones

2270
03:45:01,950 --> 03:45:05,229
Why does this casino look like a tf2 trade server map?

2271
03:45:12,520 --> 03:45:14,520
I don't I don't know why

2272
03:45:15,420 --> 03:45:17,420
Oh wait, that's the wrong way

2273
03:45:43,180 --> 03:45:49,290
People love these things. God damn it. They just they they okay. I'm filling the fucking casino with these

2274
03:45:51,290 --> 03:45:53,690
If they go people go nuts for these

2275
03:45:54,329 --> 03:46:14,760
I need to put a poker table. I need poker right here. Okay. This is this brings in people

2276
03:46:15,319 --> 03:46:16,700
poker

2277
03:46:16,700 --> 03:46:18,350
poker

2278
03:46:18,350 --> 03:46:20,590
Bang, I know it was five grand, but I need it

2279
03:46:26,409 --> 03:46:28,840
And a good dealer

2280
03:46:28,840 --> 03:46:34,989
Five star dealer at poker. Let's go. This is gonna bring in big money

2281
03:46:36,680 --> 03:46:39,479
Minimum bet 100 fucking bucks high roll of poker

2282
03:46:47,069 --> 03:46:49,069
I'm gonna drop the minimums on here back to 10

2283
03:46:49,719 --> 03:46:51,239
maximum 75

2284
03:46:51,239 --> 03:47:03,440
A dealer doesn't play poker

2285
03:47:03,440 --> 03:47:05,040
Right, whatever

2286
03:47:05,040 --> 03:47:07,040
It's just the man. It's a video game

2287
03:47:08,520 --> 03:47:11,639
Oh all the uh technicians quit. That's make sense. Okay

2288
03:47:12,360 --> 03:47:24,969
Here we go. Oh, you're a floor man

I gotta let the casino do what it's supposed to do and make money

2296
03:48:01,559 --> 03:48:06,120
Are you cheating here? No, you're just playing here. Why are you playing here? Wait, you are cheating here

Just check i'm not gonna point fingers yet. Where's my floor manager?

I need to start to put two and two together here

2353

2367
03:54:57,260 --> 03:54:59,340
Yes, I did. Yes. I did look

2368
03:55:00,059 --> 03:55:01,690
What?

2369
03:55:01,690 --> 03:55:03,479
I'll show you

2370
03:55:03,479 --> 03:55:12,590
Do you want to you want to see?

2371
03:55:12,590 --> 03:55:15,229
Justice for ludo. No, he

2372
03:55:23,629 --> 03:55:24,510

Look, all right. If you have if you have a jackpot that hits

2375
03:55:37,709 --> 03:55:40,010
for a hundred dollars

2376
03:55:40,090 --> 03:55:41,290
every day

2377
03:55:41,290 --> 03:55:43,290
right rather than

2378
03:55:43,370 --> 03:55:46,010
You have a jackpot hit for a thousand dollars

2379
03:55:47,129 --> 03:55:48,409
Once a week

2380
03:55:48,409 --> 03:55:51,790
That's the difference

2381
03:55:51,790 --> 03:55:58,139
You understand

2382
03:55:58,139 --> 03:56:33,309
Get that scalp that hashtag. Okay this tutorial. Okay. First we'll look at configuring gambling tables

2383
03:56:33,389 --> 03:56:38,909
Okay, let's see. Let's see. Let's take a look over one of the roulette tables and click the right mouse button

2384
03:56:39,680 --> 03:56:43,790
This is the attract the top three. We don't need to hear this

2385
03:56:46,700 --> 03:56:51,020
Now click on the attractions. This displays a list of all attractions

2386
03:56:52,459 --> 03:56:57,100
Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep

2387
03:56:57,260 --> 03:57:00,379
You can now see the position. Yes, I can. Yes, I can. Yes, I can

2388
03:57:02,219 --> 03:57:07,819
The button on the extreme right on the screen the info about yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep

2389
03:57:08,940 --> 03:57:10,940
Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep

2390
03:57:10,940 --> 03:57:17,600
Walter the minimum or yep. Yep. The display. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep

2391
03:57:17,600 --> 03:57:20,079
There are two buttons. Uh-huh move the cursor

2392
03:57:21,840 --> 03:57:23,840
Okay slot machine, let's go

2393
03:57:30,440 --> 03:57:33,079
They allow you to set the jackpot frequency as low

2394
03:57:33,559 --> 03:57:38,920
Medium or high and the return percentage as low medium or high

2395
03:57:40,840 --> 03:57:44,360
A high jackpot frequency will pay smaller amounts more often

2396
03:57:44,920 --> 03:57:48,920
And a low jackpot frequency will pay higher prizes less often

2397
03:57:49,719 --> 03:57:53,239
The overall payout is not affected by jackpot frequency

2398
03:57:53,559 --> 03:57:57,399
But certain visitor types prefer their payouts little and often

2399
03:57:58,040 --> 03:58:00,760
Other types prefer them big and less frequent

2400
03:58:04,729 --> 03:58:08,989
The overall payout is not affected by jackpot frequency

2401
03:58:11,700 --> 03:58:18,739
This is a high jackpot will pay smaller amounts

2402
03:58:19,680 --> 03:58:24,110
More often a low jackpot will pay

2403
03:58:26,270 --> 03:58:30,110
Higher higher will pay higher prizes less often

2404
03:58:30,350 --> 03:58:36,430
The overall payout is not affected by jackpot fucking frequency, dude

2405
03:58:38,079 --> 03:58:41,600
That's what I was give me the clip. Give me the clip. Give me the clip. Give me the clip

2407
03:58:51,120 --> 03:58:59,010
Altering the return people were telling me not to do high jackpot low return return percentage will pay out more

2408
03:58:59,090 --> 03:59:06,739
This is what we were this is what we were fighting about high low high jackpot low payout

2409
03:59:19,700 --> 03:59:57,940
Okay, can we get back to fucking life here look look this is the machines of the machines everyone was screaming about high low

2424
04:01:49,549 --> 04:01:51,870
Somebody walked by and kicked the machine

Okay

2503
04:11:02,959 --> 04:11:04,959

Five dollars and then a bonus of ten for everybody everybody

2508
04:11:41,440 --> 04:11:43,600
Who's cheating?

2509
04:11:43,600 --> 04:11:46,530

04:11:59,629 --> 04:12:11,870
Poker is turning to profit blackjack is doing. Okay

04:12:19,790 --> 04:12:24,129

04:12:24,129 --> 04:12:39,100
Oh person quit

2517
04:12:39,100 --> 04:12:41,100
The visitor you just beat up is a plummet

2518
04:12:41,100 --> 04:12:42,379
Holy shit

2519
04:12:42,379 --> 04:12:44,879

2520
04:12:45,760 --> 04:12:46,959
Nice

2521
04:12:46,959 --> 04:13:00,670
I think at this point. I probably no one floor man is fine here. I think i'm gonna do maybe another row of mediums

2522
04:13:01,229 --> 04:13:07,969
Maybe somehow. Ah, no, just get that get to 44 000. Don't do anything. Just keep the ball rolling

2523
04:13:10,370 --> 04:13:12,590

2525
04:13:37,549 --> 04:13:39,790
Um, I don't think nobody even cares that this is happening

2526
04:13:45,229 --> 04:13:47,069
It's like you're not evacuating

2527
04:13:47,069 --> 04:13:51,889
This is just kind of a normal occurrence for this guy. This guy desperately is like I hope it doesn't set the alarm off

2528
04:13:52,209 --> 04:13:54,209
I think I can get it before it shuts off the alarm

2529
04:13:55,549 --> 04:13:57,149
This is the guy's our hero

2530
04:13:57,149 --> 04:14:05,840
Holy shit

2531
04:14:05,840 --> 04:14:12,829
I want to hire this guy. Can I get this guy? One of your ads is finished running

2532
04:14:14,459 --> 04:14:17,149

2747
04:36:22,979 --> 04:36:26,500
That's why there needs to be a wall here like here in here

2748
04:36:26,500 --> 04:36:29,090

2753
04:37:43,060 --> 04:37:46,979
Nice wall stupid. Well, what do you want me to do? I didn't plan with walls

2754
04:37:48,099 --> 04:37:52,340
Separate them by floors right only slots. Yes. Yes, you're right. You're right

2755
04:37:52,500 --> 04:37:54,500
But I put bowling alleys upstairs

And I put a porn theater and a restaurant that no one goes to nobody eats here

2757

3146
05:22:33,020 --> 05:22:34,700
Who is this?

3147
05:22:34,700 --> 05:22:42,450
Somebody just came down here

3148
05:22:45,259 --> 05:22:57,259
Wait, where are you? They shut the door

3149
05:22:57,900 --> 05:23:10,049
How much is it for a new casino? Thirty thousand dollars, right?

3150
05:23:27,439 --> 05:23:32,819
The police are on their way to the casino

3151
05:23:37,099 --> 05:23:40,700

3152

I'm, sorry. I so badly just wanted to kill that chef that chef was just fucked it all up for me

3156
05:24:26,580 --> 05:24:31,380
We were on a trajectory of growth and that guy burnt the casino down twice

3157
05:24:33,119 --> 05:24:36,400
So, I mean he did it back to back and he ruined everything

3158
05:24:37,200 --> 05:24:39,520
So the second I had the opportunity you gotta give me a hit man

3159
05:24:39,520 --> 05:24:41,520
And it's an old guy with a gun downstairs in the basement

3160
05:24:41,520 --> 05:24:44,000
You don't think i'm gonna get you don't think i'm gonna eliminate the chef down there

3161
05:24:45,659 --> 05:24:50,700
And then I mean the I did I plant that was not the the second part of that. It wasn't supposed to happen

3162
05:24:51,259 --> 05:25:02,209
Oh, we haven't saved for the clowns to come in. We're gonna continue tomorrow. Oh this game is

3163
05:25:03,169 --> 05:25:04,369
Hysterical

3164
05:25:04,369 --> 05:25:08,979
What an absolute mess of a game. It's great though

3165
05:25:10,639 --> 05:25:15,119

3218
05:29:41,389 --> 05:29:44,110
After finding out that you decided to raid kiwo instead of him

3219
05:29:53,409 --> 05:29:59,650
You guys would never have behaved yourself. There's no way that you guys would have been like a hundred of you would have gotten banned

Silence serenity. Thanks for 250 people are ripping on you for the porn kitchen

3340
05:41:48,900 --> 05:41:51,860
But the only place I can see something like that existing is in a casino

3341
05:41:53,340 --> 05:41:55,279
That's yeah

3342
05:41:55,279 --> 05:42:03,330
Well, yeah, pretty true rock writing. Thanks for five dollars the sandy vomit soaked floors the screams of pleasure and

3343
05:42:04,349 --> 05:42:06,169
pain

3344
05:42:06,169 --> 05:42:11,549
Interimly with country music dance floor employee outrage five unprovoked killings ludo's

3345
05:42:12,110 --> 05:42:17,549
Slog garbowski revenge arc aside from the hookers. This is what I imagined when you mentioned something about doing a live event

3346
05:42:18,029 --> 05:42:20,029
In a public venue last stream

3347
05:42:20,430 --> 05:42:32,130
What the fuck noodle is bad at gaming thanks for 250 this casino reminds me of the hotel

3348
05:42:32,529 --> 05:42:34,770
They stay at in fear and loathing in las vegas

3349
05:42:35,250 --> 05:42:40,209
Also, please consider my group therapy stream idea. I need this in my life hire an actor instead of a therapist if you must

3350
05:42:40,930 --> 05:42:46,220
a

3351
05:42:46,220 --> 05:42:49,040
Okay, a group therapy stream

3352
05:42:49,040 --> 05:42:52,159
Would just be the family dinner stream again

3353
05:42:56,909 --> 05:43:00,189
You know, that's what it would be. The only difference would be it would just it would be

3354
05:43:01,069 --> 05:43:03,360
Somebody would be there

3355
05:43:03,360 --> 05:43:06,849
Sitting there pretending to be a therapist

3356
05:43:08,770 --> 05:43:10,450
I'm for part two

3357
05:43:10,450 --> 05:43:13,330
Let's see if I can get the gang back together again. I don't know about that

3358
05:43:15,740 --> 05:43:20,939
Miami hotlines. Thanks for the thousand bits king your interior decoration skills need work. Your casino is ugly

3359
05:43:22,380 --> 05:43:33,759
That's all right. It's okay. I said I wasn't gonna read king out loud anymore, but I just did

3360
05:43:35,180 --> 05:43:37,419
Let's put the credits on here. What do you say?

3361
05:43:39,630 --> 05:43:42,380
All these subs. Thanks a lot guys

3362
05:43:42,380 --> 05:43:49,090
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you

3363
05:43:49,090 --> 05:43:53,569
I can even run them

3364
05:43:54,770 --> 05:43:56,049
There they go

3365
05:43:56,049 --> 05:43:57,939
Thanks a lot guys

3366
05:43:57,939 --> 05:44:10,959
For your subscriptions. I appreciate it, but they've been subbed for a year sub for a week sub for a month or never ever

3367
05:44:11,840 --> 05:44:16,529
Thanks again. Hey snooze. Thanks for the 1500 bits. Hey jerma

3368
05:44:16,529 --> 05:44:19,889
Thanks for the great content you make and hope you and your loved ones are well during this time

3369
05:44:20,450 --> 05:44:22,369
Not to get into anything personal

3370
05:44:22,369 --> 05:44:26,689
But I was wanting to ask your opinion on how couples who don't have much in common make things work

3371
05:44:27,740 --> 05:44:31,119
You and kim seem like almost opposites in terms of personality

3372
05:44:31,759 --> 05:44:34,479
I might be wrong, but it just comes off that way. I wanted to see your thoughts on it

3373
05:44:34,479 --> 05:44:39,590
Thanks again for all that you do opposites attract

3374
05:44:41,000 --> 05:44:52,150
Isn't there isn't there like a whole thing about that? They hate each other

3375
05:44:53,110 --> 05:44:59,279
You guys have magnets

3376
05:44:59,279 --> 05:45:00,319
um

3377
05:45:00,319 --> 05:45:02,319
How do you hold on? Let me let me think about this

3378
05:45:03,729 --> 05:45:05,009
How do you

3379
05:45:05,009 --> 05:45:07,009
Couples don't have much in common

3380
05:45:07,090 --> 05:45:09,330
Well things that me and kim have in common you guys don't see

3381
05:45:10,659 --> 05:45:12,520
That you don't hear about

3382
05:45:12,520 --> 05:45:18,360
Like kim doesn't really play very many video games or doesn't really she's not really into this whole space here

3383
05:45:19,000 --> 05:45:22,840
She's not really into twitch or youtube or like gaming really but that's

3384
05:45:23,560 --> 05:45:25,959
We have a lot of other stuff in common that you guys don't even see

3385
05:45:32,240 --> 05:45:34,319
but

3386
05:45:34,319 --> 05:45:36,319
in terms of how

3387
05:45:36,720 --> 05:45:38,400
How would you have?

3388
05:45:38,400 --> 05:45:40,900
How would you make it work if you didn't have anything in common?

3389
05:45:42,930 --> 05:45:47,090
I don't know. I really do. I really can't answer that question. Unfortunately. I can't really give you a good answer

3390
05:45:47,729 --> 05:45:56,360
Because i'm trying to think of of if i've ever been in a scenario that was like that

3391
05:45:58,290 --> 05:46:02,849
But all the relationships that i've had there's been there's been at least a few things that were really

3392
05:46:03,490 --> 05:46:07,830
That we really clicked on

3393
05:46:07,830 --> 05:46:13,159
So I really can't give you too much advice on this or I can't give you my thoughts on it because I don't really

3394
05:46:13,560 --> 05:46:15,560
I don't really have an experience with it

3395
05:46:17,599 --> 05:46:19,439
Like what what do you have in common?

3396
05:46:19,439 --> 05:46:21,110
We both knit

3397
05:46:21,110 --> 05:46:29,889
We both sew

3398
05:46:29,889 --> 05:46:36,049
We both like we both love wine. We both like wine. We were very very passionate about wine

3399
05:46:36,930 --> 05:46:38,529
We both love food

3400
05:46:38,529 --> 05:46:40,529
We both love animals

3401
05:46:41,250 --> 05:46:46,130
A majority of our conversations are about animals are about dogs specifically auto

3402
05:46:47,250 --> 05:46:50,340
um

3403
05:46:50,340 --> 05:46:53,220
We both live in north las vegas, you know, right?

3404
05:46:54,560 --> 05:46:57,520
or henderson or summerlin or

3405
05:46:59,090 --> 05:47:09,009
Enterprise or i don't live on the strip. Yeah, nobody can live on the strip. It doesn't work that way

3406
05:47:09,569 --> 05:47:21,889
Nobody nobody like lives in like the belagio guys. That's not how it works. So that pretty much confirms the strip

3407
05:47:29,409 --> 05:47:30,869
Stop

3408
05:47:30,869 --> 05:47:39,169
Stop that now we got him. Nobody got me. Nobody got me

3409
05:47:40,930 --> 05:47:49,889
Uh, no, but we have we have plenty things in common. I don't know anything about knitting at all. I made that up

3410
05:47:50,450 --> 05:47:53,119
To make us seem cute

3411
05:47:53,119 --> 05:47:56,279
Shit, how do you have so much energy?

3412
05:47:57,520 --> 05:48:04,069
uh, it bottles up to a point where I can't contain it anymore and it has to come out either with a loud expletive noise

3413
05:48:04,790 --> 05:48:06,470
or

3414
05:48:06,470 --> 05:48:19,380
This has to come out has to but thank you snooze for the 15 dollars. Appreciate it. Miami hotlines again 250

3415
05:48:19,380 --> 05:48:23,060
Wow king you're so bad at this game. That's really epic and sexy of you. That's funny

3416
05:48:23,459 --> 05:48:26,740
That actually is kind of a funny comment the end of it. It's funny, too

3417
05:48:27,380 --> 05:48:31,060
Uh, thanks for the 250. Thanks the fax machine for the five community subs

3418
05:48:32,389 --> 05:48:34,950
Appreciate that

3419
05:48:34,950 --> 05:48:40,790
50 from goiki goiki. Thanks for the 5000 bits clown convention waiting room. I know and we didn't get to see it

3420
05:48:40,869 --> 05:48:43,139
We didn't get to even see it

3421
05:48:43,139 --> 05:48:47,680
Thanks for the 5000 bits

3422
05:48:47,680 --> 05:48:53,889
50 fucking dollars, dude

3423
05:48:53,970 --> 05:48:57,970
It was a little while ago, but sorry. I missed it. It's a lot of money

3424
05:49:01,169 --> 05:49:05,810
Hey geo love. Thanks with three dollars germa. Go see the clowns. I didn't I know I

3425
05:49:06,610 --> 05:49:09,009
Shit went off the rails there at the end

3426
05:49:09,810 --> 05:49:11,810
We'll come back to it tomorrow. We'll figure it out

3427
05:49:12,840 --> 05:49:14,759
Fix related cabbage. Thanks for 250 germa

3428
05:49:14,759 --> 05:49:19,000
I saw that you played super mario rpg last year and I was wondering if you would ever play paper mario

3429
05:49:19,560 --> 05:49:23,020
Maybe around august for the first game's 20th anniversary

3430
05:49:24,119 --> 05:49:33,939
Um, I mean august is long enough away where I could lie to you and say yes and then forget

3431
05:49:34,659 --> 05:49:37,669
But i'm not gonna do that I feel like I do that quite often

3432
05:49:38,310 --> 05:49:43,400
um

3433
05:49:43,400 --> 05:49:47,000
I'm gonna say maybe maybe for the 20th anniversary. Maybe

3434
05:49:47,720 --> 05:49:50,340
I know people love that game

3435
05:49:50,340 --> 05:49:53,479
Worth a shot. Hey skinny peter

3436
05:49:53,959 --> 05:49:56,919
Thanks for the thousand bits germa if we're going to get an easy bake oven stream

3437
05:49:56,919 --> 05:49:59,319
Could we also get a creepy crawly bug maker stream?

3438
05:50:02,209 --> 05:50:06,040
Part of the plan not only is it going to be an easy bake oven stream

3439
05:50:06,040 --> 05:50:09,319
But i'm also getting a bunch of other of those toy food item game things

3440
05:50:10,560 --> 05:50:11,680
And that's going to be one of them

3441
05:50:11,680 --> 05:50:16,000
Although I might refuse to eat them because they creepy crawler bug maker shit

3442
05:50:16,720 --> 05:50:18,720
Released in like 1998

3443
05:50:19,119 --> 05:50:22,400
And this stuff probably is not edible anymore. We'll find out if there's any new ones

3444
05:50:24,419 --> 05:50:26,840
Thanks for the thousand bits though

3445
05:50:26,840 --> 05:50:31,959
Our alecran thanks for the 250 germa. It's so nice to have found a conservative trump supporting streamer. I know I knew

3446
05:50:32,520 --> 05:50:35,080
As soon as you refuse to support bernie by rating him

3447
05:50:50,500 --> 05:50:52,500
political bernie pog

3448
05:50:53,139 --> 05:50:58,520

What political party does he follow?

3453
05:51:07,490 --> 05:51:09,490
Because you guys are fucking on fire tonight

3454
05:51:18,479 --> 05:51:20,720

05:51:40,080 --> 05:51:42,259
Northeast vegas left. All right

3458
05:51:44,709 --> 05:51:51,750
We've had so many conversations on this stream about random shit. You could probably fucking piece together

3459
05:51:52,389 --> 05:51:55,270
The type of kind of political leanings that I have

3460
05:51:55,830 --> 05:52:00,470
Do it's not you know what I mean? Like do I really do you really what do you think?

3461
05:52:07,409 --> 05:52:09,970
He's a fucking liberal. He's a liberal

3462
05:52:11,380 --> 05:52:15,380
He must be he's got to be he's got to be and that's big that fires me up

3463
05:52:15,860 --> 05:52:22,560
No, he's probably he's one of those fucking right winners

3464
05:52:23,810 --> 05:52:26,369
God, I hate those mother fuckers

3465
05:52:27,009 --> 05:52:30,849
You understand how like he there's no winning here

3466
05:52:36,340 --> 05:52:41,700
What if what if I say one of these out loud half of you hate me for the rest of my life

3467
05:52:42,419 --> 05:52:44,419
You understand how this works?

3468
05:52:46,099 --> 05:52:52,180
Even if I do fall politically in one of these categories saying it out loud is a like

3469
05:52:52,659 --> 05:53:03,830
A third of you no longer want to hear me talk anymore. We don't already god damn it

3470
05:53:07,990 --> 05:53:09,270
At the east

3471
05:53:09,270 --> 05:53:11,270
Left leaning god damn it

3472
05:53:12,020 --> 05:53:16,580
All right. All right enough enough enough enough. We're moving on we're moving on from this

3473
05:53:17,220 --> 05:53:22,180
I don't like that. I don't like this joke. We're moving on from it. It's too. All right, we're too much. Let's go

3474
05:53:26,439 --> 05:53:30,119
No more no more of this. No more of this. No more. There's no more. No more. No more. No more. No more

3475
05:53:32,580 --> 05:53:38,919
here, okay, I live in a giant shoe in the middle of space and

3476
05:53:39,799 --> 05:53:45,080
I'm not even from your fucking planet. So how am I supposed to know where I've leaned politically on your planet?

3477
05:53:45,080 --> 05:53:50,200
I don't even know who what this is. I don't even know what the democrat republican left serve. I don't know if that is

3478
05:53:51,360 --> 05:53:53,360
I've got my own system up here

3479
05:54:00,979 --> 05:54:07,000
There you go. This is your answer for all your questions. Thanks. Goobery juice with the five dollars

3480
05:54:08,069 --> 05:54:14,549
Hey, oh, no ludo. Nine eight five. These are some memes and chat that you missed. Why don't we have like a me a chat meme?

3481
05:54:16,299 --> 05:54:21,639
Recap I thought I should start donating these so that the creators of these memes can get your reaction

3482
05:54:23,619 --> 05:54:25,540
Also last stream you implied

3483
05:54:25,540 --> 05:54:31,650
That something was going to happen to bugleberry in the future. No

3484
05:54:32,369 --> 05:54:34,450
Like no, that's not what i'm talking about

3485
05:54:39,159 --> 05:54:41,159
Bugleberry's gonna be fine. Don't worry

3486
05:54:44,560 --> 05:54:45,439
uh

3487
05:54:45,439 --> 05:54:51,400
But for the for the meme reactions, here's what's gonna happen. This is what's gonna happen here

3488
05:54:53,279 --> 05:54:56,319
I don't know how this is gonna be done, but this is how it's gonna be done

3489
05:54:56,959 --> 05:55:00,400
There's a lot of images that come on this stream tons of people give

3490
05:55:01,119 --> 05:55:04,799
Images there's links and links and hey, I want to see this. I want to see that. Hey check this out

3491
05:55:04,880 --> 05:55:06,639
Look at this. There's a photoshop

3492
05:55:06,639 --> 05:55:08,639
What's gonna happen is i'm gonna have

3493
05:55:09,119 --> 05:55:12,080
a window browser source that is capturing

3494
05:55:12,720 --> 05:55:14,959
a website that website will be

3495
05:55:16,479 --> 05:55:21,090
I'm not going to tell you what website this is

3496
05:55:22,310 --> 05:55:25,110
Because I don't fuck who cares. It's reddit. There's going to be a reddit

3497
05:55:25,509 --> 05:55:27,509
That's specifically going to be for image uploads

3498
05:55:31,330 --> 05:55:36,130
And I can capture it and over the course of the stream. I can just cap it and we can go through like three or four of them

3499
05:55:36,689 --> 05:55:40,439
They'll just be right there

3500
05:55:40,439 --> 05:55:45,639
And if there's images that come through the stream like they always is like at least five six seven of them come out of each stream

3501
05:55:46,119 --> 05:55:48,119
It'll already be captured and we can already just do it

3502
05:55:50,709 --> 05:55:52,709
And they can be you know

3503
05:55:53,569 --> 05:55:57,729
If we have a good enough non shit posting kind of yeah guy

3504
05:55:57,970 --> 05:56:12,209
I'm just gonna spam the reddit. We'll have people check them before I click so there'll be ways for me to check

3505
05:56:12,770 --> 05:56:14,900
That'll work out

3506
05:56:14,900 --> 05:56:22,799
So then it keeps image links out of the chat room so people can chat

3507
05:56:23,439 --> 05:56:26,000
Or yell their favorite video game at me once a day

3508
05:56:26,720 --> 05:56:31,540
And we can have that in a separate place that it's easy for me to get to

3509
05:56:38,709 --> 05:56:40,709
Crash bandicoot 2 that's your favorite game

3510
05:56:41,349 --> 05:56:43,430
Well, we should probably talk about that

3511
05:56:44,150 --> 05:56:50,849
But that's where they're gonna be and I and by the way, i'm making the reddit

3512
05:56:51,490 --> 05:56:56,849
So it's like well, okay. I I have two already. No, no, no, no. No, it's i'm gonna own this shit

3513
05:56:59,029 --> 05:57:02,790
And you will not know what it is until it is ready and it's only gonna come from my mouth

3514
05:57:06,450 --> 05:57:14,069
That's where it's gonna go. How'd you call me out like that?

3515
05:57:14,630 --> 05:57:20,400
I've won. I said we have to talk about that. Why not crash bandicoot 3?

3516
05:57:21,279 --> 05:57:23,279
Racing team racing. Why two?

3517
05:57:23,759 --> 05:57:28,880
I thought three was a better one three had more characters three had more tracks and it was graphically superior

3518
05:57:29,599 --> 05:57:42,049
I'm just I that's just my opinion. That's what I think

3519
05:57:42,930 --> 05:57:44,930
Is there a crash team racing three?

3520
05:57:45,400 --> 05:57:50,400
Is there one?

3521
05:57:50,400 --> 05:57:57,919
No, okay. Never mind. Uh in the meantime

3522
05:57:59,360 --> 05:58:00,639
we're

3523
05:58:00,639 --> 05:58:02,319
we're gonna have to

3524
05:58:02,319 --> 05:58:04,340
abstain from

3525
05:58:04,340 --> 05:58:09,380
Clicking on images and till I get that shit going i'm gonna try to get that going over the next few days

3526
05:58:10,099 --> 05:58:15,240
Probably like next week or in like probably two months because that's like a real time frame from my fucking

3527
05:58:16,439 --> 05:58:20,599
High koala brain

3528
05:58:20,599 --> 05:58:22,200
Uh, let's see. What do you got?

3529
05:58:22,200 --> 05:58:30,439
What do you got? What do you got?

3530
05:58:37,569 --> 05:58:39,569
And there's a bunch of videos on here

3531
05:58:46,790 --> 05:58:52,470
I'd save them save them save them. There's there's like eight. There's like three videos and eight like seven images on here

3532
05:58:54,119 --> 05:58:56,119
Those three images in four videos

3533
05:59:01,000 --> 05:59:06,759
And I save them for community content night. Oh, but we never see those because he never fucking does those either

3534
05:59:12,119 --> 05:59:16,680
Yeah, I know. I know. I know give it to me. Let me hear it. Let me hear it. I know let me hear it

3535
05:59:19,459 --> 05:59:21,459
At least click the last image

3536
05:59:27,490 --> 05:59:30,290
Hold on. Let me load some of these up. Oh my fucking god

3537
05:59:35,040 --> 05:59:37,040
I this is not even my

3538
05:59:40,599 --> 05:59:46,549
Okay, i'll show off the images and let's hold on a second. Oh, this is fucking terrifying

3539
05:59:47,909 --> 05:59:50,470
Why do all these have to be besides the bernie pogg one?

3540
05:59:51,029 --> 06:00:13,090
Let's take a look at this one pretty good. All right, that one's good

3541
06:00:14,950 --> 06:00:17,270
This is an ed ed and eddy picture of ed

3542
06:00:19,159 --> 06:00:21,159
I believe that is him eating a shoe

3543
06:00:24,040 --> 06:00:30,840
It is okay

3544
06:00:30,840 --> 06:00:32,840
and then here is

3545
06:00:32,919 --> 06:00:36,869
bernie pogg

3546
06:00:36,869 --> 06:00:42,759
Where is it?

3547
06:00:42,840 --> 06:01:05,000
Okay. Well, I didn't mean to stretch that what is this one? I can't make that an emo. That's not my face

3548
06:01:19,279 --> 06:01:22,869
Watch that if you want

3549
06:01:30,000 --> 06:01:43,919
Here look it's like a ton of noise and a bunch of kids like

3550
06:01:46,159 --> 06:01:48,959
Oh look at that you just walk in and you just go like

3551
06:01:57,779 --> 06:01:59,779
All right. I'll see you guys tomorrow

3552
06:02:00,450 --> 06:02:01,810
That's the end

3553
06:02:01,810 --> 06:02:03,810
That's where it ends

3554
06:02:03,810 --> 06:02:07,009
except

3555
06:02:07,009 --> 06:02:10,610
Uh squimps gave ten dollars and fifty cents ten fifty

3556
06:02:11,569 --> 06:02:15,590
Thanks to the bits. Thanks to the big bits. That's over ten dollars. Thank you. Hey germ

3557
06:02:15,590 --> 06:02:19,840
I'm a college student who got kicked out of the dorms by the whole covet situation

3558
06:02:20,479 --> 06:02:22,479
Those streams have really helped me get through everything

3559
06:02:22,639 --> 06:02:25,680
I've been in quarantine with my dad and we watch your streams together pretty much every day

3560
06:02:26,500 --> 06:02:28,500
Anyways, it's his birthday tomorrow

3561
06:02:28,500 --> 06:02:30,500
You can wish him a happy birthday. That would be pretty cool

3562
06:02:31,330 --> 06:02:33,330
All right, you don't have to of course I will

3563
06:02:34,439 --> 06:02:37,459

Take care of each other. Hope you have a great one

3565

Not sure how old you are, but

3566
06:02:47,080 --> 06:02:49,970
Hey

3569
06:03:09,520 --> 06:03:13,520
Like a hey you look 38 and if you're like 40 or 55 or something like that

3570
06:03:13,599 --> 06:03:17,439
Oh, if you're like in your 40s or 50s like oh what i'm 30. I look 38. That's good

3571
06:03:17,840 --> 06:03:22,959
That's like a good thing like hey 38 never looks so good, right? You look like you're 38. You could be like 50

3572
06:03:23,650 --> 06:03:28,069
That's good. That's why I said that

3573
06:03:28,549 --> 06:03:30,229
That's a boomer joke

3574
06:03:30,229 --> 06:03:34,150
Yeah, okay sweat out. What are you? I'm not no i'm not mocking anybody

3575
06:03:34,869 --> 06:03:37,919
So it doesn't look 38. No, i'm saying like

3576
06:03:38,560 --> 06:03:43,439
Let's say for instance, let's just say for instance that somebody's like 50 years old or 45 years old

3577
06:03:43,680 --> 06:03:55,299
Hey, dude, like hey 38 never looks so good, right? Like, oh 38. Yeah. Okay, you're fun. Stop we get it

3578
06:03:55,540 --> 06:03:58,180
No, you don't half of you don't half of you don't get it

3579
06:04:02,520 --> 06:04:04,799
And that's very clear

3580
06:04:04,799 --> 06:04:06,799
By the way that you are acting

3581
06:04:07,200 --> 06:04:19,080
See you tomorrow wait

3582
06:04:19,080 --> 06:04:20,040
I

06:04:20,040 --> 06:04:22,040
Didn't want to miss

3584
06:04:22,119 --> 06:04:23,240
bits

3585
06:04:23,240 --> 06:04:25,240
from dumpus rumpus

3586
06:04:25,400 --> 06:04:29,799
Dumpus rumpus. Thanks for five dollars. Jeremy long time viewer first time donator. Thanks dumpus

3587
06:04:30,520 --> 06:04:33,240
Thanks for being my favorite entertainer for the last like eight fucking years

3588
06:04:34,040 --> 06:04:37,110
I can't believe you still think i'm interesting eight years later

3589
06:04:38,310 --> 06:04:40,630
We've talked about this before

3590
06:04:42,229 --> 06:04:43,669
But

3591
06:04:43,669 --> 06:04:45,669
um watching tv shows

3592
06:04:46,310 --> 06:04:52,610
After season seven or eight usually people just don't fucking care anymore. That's shocking to me

3593
06:04:52,610 --> 06:04:54,849
I'm like, I can't believe people still like this

3594
06:04:55,650 --> 06:04:57,889
Well, thanks

3595
06:04:58,049 --> 06:05:06,319
Appreciate it. No, we're not raiding it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

3596
06:05:07,279 --> 06:05:10,720
No

3597
06:05:10,720 --> 06:05:12,799
I gotta get them under control. I've got to get them under control

3598
06:05:14,500 --> 06:05:16,819
That's gonna it's gonna take a double to get them under control

3599
06:05:17,459 --> 06:05:20,500
We're gonna have to take double. I think yep it is

3600
06:05:25,060 --> 06:05:25,939
Stop

3601
06:05:25,939 --> 06:05:34,610
Okay, good

3602
06:05:34,610 --> 06:05:39,169
Hey, juby. Thanks for the five dollars. This has been a god tier stream. You ever played evil genius

3603
06:05:39,810 --> 06:05:43,970
If you like this game, I think that'd make a great stream too. It's actually on the list. It is on the list

3604
06:05:44,689 --> 06:05:49,840
Get rid of me, please

3605
06:05:49,840 --> 06:05:51,840
You're gonna say my name spell it correctly

3606
06:06:01,169 --> 06:06:03,330
Be a lot. I see it misspelled quite frequently actually

3607
06:06:07,200 --> 06:06:09,200
All right. I'll see you tomorrow. Good night guys

3608
06:06:10,020 --> 06:06:16,869
Take care. Have a great rest of your night. Yep. We're gonna play more casino ink tomorrow afternoon and then from there

3609
06:06:17,669 --> 06:06:21,830
From there we will go

3610
06:06:21,830 --> 06:06:23,830
to potentially watch a movie

3611
06:06:25,569 --> 06:06:30,849
I and I i'm i'm not gonna talk about this tomorrow. I think i'm gonna talk about this tomorrow, but

3612
06:06:32,799 --> 06:06:35,759
Never mind. This is funny to me. I'm holding this for tomorrow

3613
06:06:36,740 --> 06:06:41,220
